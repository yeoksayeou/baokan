<h3>疏通米源充裕民食　國府採緊急措置　盟邦各當局決予全面協力</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　邇來京滬各地米價狂漲，一般民衆咸感莫大威脅。政府默察時艱，爰經決定將米統會及其他一切團體之採辦工作暫行停止，同時對現行米糧移動限制亦予撤銷，以期開放來源，圓滑流通。此項米糧緊急對策，誠屬賢明之措置，民食恐慌定能因此而獲得合理之解除。陳行政院長特就此發表重耍談話，深盼各地官民共體斯旨予以協力。同時盟邦之派遣軍及大使館當局亦皆分別發表談話，對國府上項措置，決予全面協力，且對軍需米之收購亦予中止。茲將陳院長及盟邦軍政當局之談話原文錄後：</p>
<p>陳行政院長談話</p>
<p>近來米價變動異常，政府默察時艱，特施行緊急措置如下：　米糧統制委員會及其他一切團體之採辦工作暫行停止。　現行米糧移動限制即行撤銷。此舉目的，在於開放來源，自由流通，使在靑黃不接之期內，仍能源源按濟，充裕民食。任何政令之推進，端賴各方之協力，如有違背政府方針而勒索留難或投機囤積者，一經發現，定必嚴懲，深盼一般官民各地軍　體念斯旨，各盡職責，以達安定民生之目的。</p>
<p>派遺軍當局談話</p>
<p>此次國民政府感於目前米價暴騰，特停止米統會及共他團體收買米糧工作，並撤廢華中一帶米糧移動之限制，使米糧之流通趨於自由圓滑，本派遣官爲呼應國民政府此種施策，亦停止一切强力支持實施之本年度軍需米之收買，並對於民需米糧之圓滑流動輸送，進而予以特別之援助，且對國民政府所期之取締不法征稅及投機囤積等，亦予充分之協力。再者，本軍在內地所收買之軍用小麥雜糧，亦盡量於上海方面放出，努力民需配給，以上爲求民需米糧之國滑供給，於米價之安定，對國民政府施策已予全面之援助，盼望中日官民共體斯旨，舉其全力協力本施策之具體實現，收獲完美之成果。</p>
<p>大使館當局談話</p>
<p>此次國民政府於靑黃不接之期，發表米糧緊急對策，米統會及其他一切團體之米糧收買工作暫行停止，米糧之移動限制亦一併撤銷，並發表聲明遠反上述施策者機予嚴懲，中國派遣軍方面亦與此呼應，停止軍米收買，軍方保管中之小麥雜糧，亦移歸一般民衆配給，並發表談話，對中國方面之施策予以全面協力，此舉牌於目下華中米糧之緊迫情形，實可謂爲適宜措置，在華日僑宜善體國府陳行政院院長及中國派造軍常局之談話旨趣，協力米糧流通，勿有違反此項施策之實施。鑒於大東亞戰爭之現狀，日華軍民惟有眞誠一體，共向完遂之途邁進，實爲今日急務，蓋與中國民衆同甘共苦，乃我對華新政策之根本要義也。</p>
<h3>深盼官民一體維護米糧恐慌得以解除</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　邇來京滬各地米價狂漲之原因，除由於時屆靑黃不接與人爲之投機操縱，暨現行戰時下邇輸困難等問題，爲其重大原因外，而米糧統制施策之不合地方實情，與糧政負責者之未能盡職，亦爲不可諱言之事實。蓋以往之統制辦法繁雜，手續太多，且每屆新數登塲之秋，又未能從事統籌，及時收購，致其結果流弊　生，肖小者流更乘機借公濟私，中飽私囊，以致收買工作難獲效果，而屆靑黃時期，更無法調節，束手坐視。此外關於軍需米與民需米之採購，失其平衡，亦爲造成今日米糧恐慌之重因。今政府當局默察時艱，毅然暫行停止米統會及一切團體之採辦工作，撤銷米糧移動限制，准許自由採運，自由流通，同時盟邦軍政當局對國府此項措置，亦予全面協力，且停止軍需米之收購，更進而將已購得之小麥雜糧，在上海方而放出，配給於民需。當局之上項對策，實爲賢明之措置，足證常局對民生之安定，至極關懷，深信經此緊急措置後，放以後，一般投機者流，難免乘機更肆猖獗，以　其囤積壟斷，吾人於此，除促其自省外，仍盼官民一體監督取締，更盼盟邦在華商人亦應共體中日提携之要義，予以全面協力。　各團體商號或其他組織，切勿利用開放之便利，作變相之巨量收買，擾亂民食，而各產區地方當局切勿藉口境內民貪，限制米糧之流動，希圖私利。　一般民衆更應共體時艱，勿大量儲藏，以助長恐慌，予投機者以機會。</p>
<h3>陳彬龢氏赴京　商民食商量　代表滬市民向政府請命</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　邇來京滬兩地，米糧價格空前狂漲，一般市民深感莫大威脅。上海市政諮詢委員陳彬龢氏，特於十五日由滬專程晋京，代表全滬市民向中樞常局請命，共謀解決民食問題。</p>
<h3>日全國團結一致　發揮其奮戰精神　鈴木首相闆明必勝之道</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日首相鈴木大將十四日在首相官　接見記者團，闡明日政府對付戰局之決心及方策，已如昨電，茲補誌詳情如下：</p>
<p>問，政府對付嚴重之本土決戰，有何必勝方策</p>
<p>答，余在本屆議會席上曾謂，冲繩戰局陷入不利之境，但僅謂不利，關於今後之局勢，未有闡明。據余自信，硫黃島之失陷及冲繩之不利，實際上均不足悲視，蓋縱續戰爭之間，戰事有勝有敗，乃當然之事。戰爭之勝敗，決不能因某一地之被佔領而妄加判斷，冲繩縱失，今後之戰爭或在九州，或在本土以外之地登陸，固難逆料，然若我人始終抱旺盛之戰意，發揮奮戰精神，必使敵人非使用更多之兵力不可。如此戰事必悠久延長，斯時敵人必感久戰之得不償失，而自求停戰，因此余不願僅重視冲繩之戰，而減弱國民之戰意也。</p>
<p>問，首相曾謂敵愈迫近本土，愈於我有利，敢問其具體方針如何？又組閣當時之戰局觀與現在之戰局觀，未知有無變化？</p>
<p>答，祇須國民士氣旺盛，我有絕對勝利之把握，敵人不能一舉有百萬大軍之登陸，結果非陸續登陸不可，五十萬軍隊之登陸，已需時數月，關於接濟，亦須有相當之準備。此次歐洲美軍在法國有大軍之登陸，然美軍在法上陸，祇須渡過狹隘之英國海峽即可，由美國至日本本土，其距敵之遠，不可與歐洲同日而語，敵人亦知此事甚難。又縱令登陸，我方亦有相當守備，且得調動大軍，中言之，敵自海上來，我即於海上擊減其運輸船，敵如迫近海岸，我人即於海岸殲敵，若果眞上陸，我人必於陸上殲滅之。我人利於陸上接濟，得集中五倍乃至十倍於敵之兵力，此點與過去島嶼作戰不同，不問敵人兵器物　如何勝於我人，絕對不心抱我不如人之憂，此即必勝之道也。</p>
<p>至此鈴木首相離開記者團之詢問，發表談話如下：「最後，余深感國民對戰局達今日之階段，實爲可喜之事，蓋余辦參加中日，日俄兩戰役，當時國民皆抱亡國民憂，然皆覺與其不戰而亡，寗若破釜沉舟，最後一戰，意氣殊爲悲壯。今德國終吿敗北而瓦解矣，然請問德國國民，果已有納粹精神少澈底了解乎，德國軍隊亦果否抱納綷之精神而作戰乎，未也。其證據爲軍隊中並無軍官作壯烈之戰死者，此在我人，則守全不同，寒班島及硫黃島兩役，我軍不問爲軍官或士德國國民與日木國民，德國軍隊與日本軍隊大不相同之點，是故以德國例日本，乃莫大之錯誤。德國擁如許大軍，卒不能抗戰到底，誠出乎日本軍人意料之外，誠然，以物量言，或許我不如敵，然我人旣上戰塲，即抱重大決心，此爲日本人之特性，我人將全國團結一致，以此潛力作戰到底。」</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>擁護米糧緊急措置</h3>
<p>國府中樞當局，鑒於最近各地米價暴漲不已，人民生活感受重大威脅，決定施行緊急措置，第一，米糧統制委員會及其他一切團體之採辦工作，暫行停止。第二，現行米糧移動限制，即行撤銷。對此緊急措置，行政院陳院長發表懇切談話，指出此舉目的，在於開放米源，以期目由流通，俾在靑黃不接期內，仍能源源接濟，充裕民食，以達安定民生之目的。</p>
<p>同時，盟邦派道軍及大使館常局也發表談話，對於國府之緊急措置，表示全面協力。派遣軍當局更爲切實呼應起見，對於本年度軍需米之收買，亦停止實施。進而將已在內地收買之軍用小麥雜糧，在上海方面盡量放出，配給民需。另一方面，對於民需米糧之運輸移動，允予特別援助，對於不法征稅及投機囤積者，協力取締。</p>
<p>我們對於中區當局的賢明措置，盟邦當局的熱忱協力，表示感佩以外，更就此舉的意義與影響申說如次：</p>
<p>最近各地米價高漲的原因，在產米區由於收買方法的未盡合理，在非產米區由於來源的阻滯。現在當局實施的緊急措置，一是停止收買，一是撤銷移動限制，完全針對　結所在，對症發藥。我們深信經此措置以後，米價高漲的原因從此消除，米糧來源從此疏通，米價必將穩定回平。我們在前日社評中，希望人民對於米價暴漲，不必過份恐慌，因爲這次米價暴漲，畢竟是不合理的，只要速籌緊急對策，對症下藥，至少可以阻過不合理的暴漲程度。現在當局旣已實施對症的措置，更得盟邦當局的切實協力，原屬不合理的米價暴漲程度，必然趨於緩和進而下跌，同時，原由米價引起的一般物價上漲，也將因米價穩定而趨於穩定。因此，人民心理可以從此安定。</p>
<p>產米區米糧旣經停止收買，則非產米區的米糧來源，自可得到源源接濟。而移動限制的撇銷，更可自由移動，疏暢運轉，一方面來源有辦法，一方面移動無限制，則供求司以調節。本市民食，原係取給於就近產米地區，希望各有關方面對於疏通米源，從速切實的負起協助與督察責任。尤其對於運輸方面特別需要。軍　人員對於米糧移動，不但絕對不准留難需索，並應隨時予以保護。對於乘機囤積居奇者，尤應嚴防取締。總之，各方面都感在疏通來源抑平米價的一個目標之下努力，達到解決民食安定民生的目的。</p>
<p>同時，我們也須認識現實，目前是在靑黃不接時期，就是產米區的餘米也未必足敷非產米區的全部需要。因此，我們重申大家應改變非米不飯的心理，而盡量採用雜糧果腹。盟邦常局已經聲明將以收買之小麥雜糧在上海放出，但仍盼當局計劃向淮海各地採購剩餘雜糧，俾多方面的充裕滬市民食來源。</p>
<p>最後，我們深盼官民協力，能在當局的緊急措置下，一舉而解除民食問題的痛苦。不過，在戰時施行經濟統制政策，原則上無可避免的，所以，米糧統制自亦無司避免的，目前的暫行停止收買及撤銷移動限制，誠然是緊急措置。我們痛定思痛，對於今後的米糧統制以至一般經濟統制，在技術上務必顧到我們固有的國情民情，對於米糧尤要軍需民食雙方兼顧，惟有基於這樣意義的統制政策，才能獲致預期的統制利益與成效。</p>
<h3>日對本土決戰　已有備無患　時問與地點更屬有利</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　沖繩之戰鬥，乃本土決戰之第一綫，前後達兩月有半，展開死鬥，實爲本土決戰之先聲。按馬里亞納基地B29型機自開始轟炸本土以來，已有半載，其最近轟炸之情形，日漸劇烈，東京·名古屋·大阪等主要都市及各地之大部國民，對於空襲，已認屬常事，而本土決戰，已非抽象觀念。大部國民之日常生活中，早已寓有此種感覺，　本土決戰與冲繩等島之離島戰，形態全異，本土決戰始可謂爲正式之決戰也。屆時，於旣往之離島戰時所遭之補給困難，當可不必憂慮矣。最初之戰鬥，其所以能異常順利者，業由軍部一再解釋，當因敵空軍之轟炸破壞，致使交通發生障礙，然仍能舉軍部及國家之全力，集中於戰塲，故得充分推展戰事，從來決定戰局，主因在海上能否補給問題，若本地決戰之際，此種補給障礙問題，其勢必轉推於敵軍身上，日軍能獲適當之戰力補給，再以與敵無甚懸殊之兵力相見於戰塲，則自豪戰備優秀之强敵美軍，亦非我敵，此乃累次戰鬥之經騐談也。雖處於制海空權掌握於敵手之不利條件下之冲繩戰鬥，於前半期，已曾覆滅敵陸軍三師團，並對新到之敵海兵三師團予以莫大打擊，目前正與敵第三批新兵激戰中。日軍藤岡·和田·賀谷等各部隊之勇戰，即屬最近之實例，決非自滿，乃眞確顯明之事實也。本土決戰之際，不問時間與地點，於日軍均絕對有利而無患，况兵力與補給可無或缺之憂，必於　護神州之大使命下固守，且有舉全民建設之必勝陣地，而靜待滅敵之日軍將兵及萬衆一心，一舉殲敵之戰意，頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>B29型機　昨空襲大阪</h3>
<p>大阪十五日中央社電　中部軍管區司令部十五日午十二時發表，馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機約三百餘架與若干小型機，於十五日上午八時四十分侵入大阪附近，以大阪市東部地區爲主耍目標，投下燒夷彈及炸彈，約歷一小時四十分，大阪市內各處及附近一部發生火災。</p>
<h3>日地方總監　將開首次會</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日政府將於十九日召開有次地方總監會議，以期具體協商總監府行政之推進方策及地方之　自戰自活體制，參加會議人員計有政府方面鈴木首相以次各閣僚，內閣各長官及總監府方面之八地方總監曁總監府高級幹部人員，屆時政府當局將明示中央移讓權限，中央及地方運絡之方式，及臨時議會所討論之總監府參與制等具髁方針。</p>
<h3>南島島方面　發現敵艦</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地十五日中央社電　由十四日晨五時至晚十一時止，似由太平洋英艦隊空母起飛之少數小型機視隊，曾前後七次來製特魯克，日制空部隊當即迎戰，業已擊退。又於南鳥島方面，亦曾發現敵別動隊之空母，巡洋艦馴逐艦各一艘。</p>
<h3>巴頓謁特魯曼</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據美新聞處華盛頓十三日電，第三軍長巴頓今日往謁特魯曼總統，渠係於本日抵此向參謀總畏馬歇爾元帥報告，並請求予以新任務。記者詢渠是否願被派赴太平洋，巴頓稱，據猜測吾人均有此願望。</p>
<h3>沖繩本島陸上　展開白刃戰　敵亟謀擴充空軍基地</h3>
<p>琉球羣島基地十五日中央社電　琉球羣島已臨雨季，十三日天氣仍甚惡劣，日。美兩軍均未能發動空軍。冲繩本島之陸上戰鬥，日以繼夜，展開白刃戰，敵勢雖盛，然日軍戰意依然强盛。</p>
<p>冲繩基地十五日中央社電　敵　戰鬥形勢之順利，乃亟謀擴充或新建冲繩之空軍基地，目前業歸敵方之飛行塲計有十處，即北·中·伊江三飛機塲，此外尚有南飛機塲（那新北方，）小　飛機塲及其他恩納。與那原·奧間·靑瀨·具志川等五空軍基地。其巾有已告竣工者，亦有積極進行最後工程者，南飛機場與小淥飛機塲，係利用原有之設備，其餘五飛機塲皆係新建者，在最近一週內趕築成。敵方對原有之北飛機塲，伊江飛機塲等，連日以多數大型運輸機運輸資材，以謀擴充飛機塲之設備，伊江島方面已完成二千公尺之完全舖裝滑走路三條，北。中兩飛機場現有B24型機，行動異常活潑。再菲島已從歐洲調來多數B24，　B17等型飛機，此種敵方活動，殊値重視</p>
<h3>緬甸戰況</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十五日中央社電　頓古方面敵軍，逐次整頓，企圖南下，五月下旬以來，曾對頓古東北方之日軍陣地加以攻擊。又敵有力部隊，於崑塔溫（頓古東北三十公里）集結，企圖與頓古捷麥街道塔古加多河南方一帶敵軍呼應，以期迂迴侵入日軍陣地。又加洛周圍日軍部隊，四日曾對持有戰車之敵軍約五百名展開邀擊戰，使敵遺棄屍體百具左右，蒙重大打擊，中止前進。又雷妙溫崑坦兩地區方面，自五月下旬以來，連日有敵機三十架左右襲日軍陣地，並以迫擊砲及羅開托砲掩護下，前來攻襲，然經該地之日軍部隊反覆展開肉搏迎擊戰後，遂告退去。</p>
<h3>中國大陸　備戰態勢</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　此次日議會中，阿南陸相曾就大陸戰况束稱：敵調緬甸之美式渝軍於昆明及芷江方面，平漢路之敵軍亦將實行大陸作戰，軍部當局對此企圖，正積極準備。繼復說明大陸戰綫之動向謂，據六月六日渝方廣播傳稱，駐渝美軍司令部發表馬爾斯第一繼動部隊之美第四百七十五步兵師團及第一百二十四騎兵師團，五月業由緬甸航空運輸至中國戰錢云云，又渝軍新編第六軍二師，四月由緬甸方面航空遝輸至湖南省西部芷江方面之前綫，與該方面之渝軍取反攻之態勢。大陸戰綫之敵軍，因有史蒂威爾公路之陸上運輸，最近行動異常活潑。渝總指揮何應欽與美將領馬克爾阿在五月考察湖南，六月中旬考察廣西等戰綫。五月之渝方六全大會席間，曾決議强化渝軍，促進渝軍之近代化，在中央所開之各戰區將領作戰會議等，在在表示彼等金圖急速實現西南總反攻之戰略態勢。渝軍自客歲湘桂作戰敗北以來，爲打通史蒂威爾公路，着手再建抗戰軍事力。陸續將在緬渝軍集結於雲南，復將第一戰區之湯恩伯軍調往雲南。由湖南通貴州雲南之廣大地域，分爲第一·第二·第三·第四之四方面軍，於何應欽總司令指揮之下，酊置湯恩伯·衛立煌·盧漢·張發奎等軍隊，企圖將約凡十個師之部下各軍隊化爲美式，積極準備反攻。現在渝軍之兵力，酊置昆明周圍有中央直糸軍三十師，湘桂西方地區陝西地區重慶地區亦均酊置直糸軍，而於華東南置中央傍糸之顧祝同軍，及戰力低劣之雜軍，更因展開知識靑年從軍運動而招集之十萬靑年編成十師，將此軍隊分置於昆明重慶漢中地區。現在美式渝軍計有在緬之新編第一軍，及最近移動中之新編第六軍。又據重慶美聯社所傳，渝方會發表擴張空軍計劃，其內容巳決定將過去二週間於美國受充分訓練之華人駕駛員轟炸員，編戰鬥機轟炸機十一隊，酊於駐渝美空軍第十四航空隊以外之基地，以期實行緊密之協力作戰。渝方因日軍威力強大，與延安軍之執拗蠶動，故將其直糸軍配於後方，然而能否如美國所期望，起而挾擊日大陸野戰軍有力一蠶之重任，出以積極之行動。極屬疑問。然彼等仍積極整備史蒂威爾公路，養成七千名中國人汽車司機人，擴張公路網，敷設中印輸油官，藉以加强中印之運絡，欲以其龐大之軍需物資，完備渝軍之武裝。値此歐洲戰爭吿終及對日本土攻擊熾烈之際，大陸戰綫漸告緊張，大陸之日派遣軍亦在靜待良機來臨，以期一舉擊滅敵軍。</p>

<h3>縣政管事處昨召開　縣區行政會議　通過縣政興革提案多件</h3>
<p>縣政管理處召集之各縣區行政會議，於昨日（十五）上午九時在市政府大禮堂舉行，計到市長（羅秘書長代），羅秘書長，胡副秘書長，縣管處蔡處長，　副處長，保安司令部余參謀處長，市府第一科葛科長，財政局田賦科裘科長，主計科李科長，市警察局張科長，　南滙，嘉定，奉賢，崇明，申江，寳山，川沙各縣縣長，江灣，滬西，滬北，浦東南，浦東北各區公署署長，第一二兩區行政督察專員公署代表，以及縣政管理處秘書科長專員視察等共三十餘人。本市盟邦連絡部熊谷部長亦偕隨員出席參加。</p>
<p>會議情形</p>
<p>九時正開會，首由縣政管理處蔡處長致開會詞，報告召集會議意義，即由羅秘書長代表周市長致訓，並由連絡部長致詞，對於各縣署長種種協助，表示感謝並願端力隨時爲各縣區解決困難問題，旋由各縣縣長各區署署長先後報告最近施政狀况，報告完畢由蔡處長宣讀上國府主席及市長致敬電文，全場一致通過，中午由市政府於會議應招待各出席人員午餐，下午二時，繼續討論議案，對於民政，保甲，財政，建設，教育以及提商公務人員，教職員，待遇問題，分別據密討論，圓滿通過。下午七時散會。由縣政管理處正副處長數宴各出席人員。</p>
<p>處長致詞</p>
<p>縣政管理處處長致開會詞云：上海特別市所屬各縣區是包括南滙，奉賢，申江，川沙，嘉定，崇明，寳山七個縣，江灣，滬北，滬西，浦東南，浦東北五個郊區。這些縣區是上海特別市的外圍，就土地面積大小來說，約共有二午八百餘平方公里，占全市百分之九十，校市區大約二十倍。就人口多寡來說，約共有二百十餘萬人，占全市三分之一，較市區少一倍。由此看來，各縣區的人口雖然少，但是土地面積很廣大，所以各縣區的行政工作，在上海特別市全盤行政作當中，是有着米可忽視的地位。關於各縣區行政工作的部門，包括民政，保甲，警政，治安，財政，經濟，生產，建設，教育，社會等等，在羅秘書長兼任處長時期，已經訂定强化縣政實施綱耍，通令施行，大家應該依照規定，積極進行，以期强比。在目前環境之十，市長秘書長更指示縣區行政工作的重點，是整飭營紀，確保治安，田賦征實，增加生產諸點。這些强化縣政綱要所規定，以及重點的一切工作，縣政府有實行的責任，行政督察專員公署，有督察的責任，縣政管理處有綜合指導的責任，我們大家應該服從市長秘書長的訓示，羣策羣力，一心一德的齊步邁進。這次縣政管理處召開縣區行政會議的目的，就是集合縣區行政工作的指導者督察者實行者，以及保安司令部　市府有關係之主管者於一堂，共同硏究進行方針，以期有所供獻，希望大家團結一致，開誠佈公的發表意見。</p>
<p>市長訓話</p>
<p>羅秘書長代表市長訓話，略謂：關於縣政的實施，已訂定强化縣政綱要頒布施行，最近蔡處長已到各縣區作一番視察，甚望以後縣政日益開展，辦理縣政應該注意的事，在强化稱要內巳有詳細的規定，茲不多述。不過目前地方行政工作，困難很多，特再提出幾點作爲努力的目標。即：　對於戰爭協力及治安工作，則以愈速愈好，同時對於民衆生活不必要的損害則以愈少愈好，不可藉口治安工作，以致擾害民衆，我們要憑自己的良心，負責去做。　市府用人考核，一秉至公，故諸位不必作人事上的顧慮，以免庸人自擾，按着必須常在管轄區域内執行職務，並多作考察工作。總之，做應該做的事，不聽不應聽的謠言，同時更要不放棄職守，切　替民衆做有利益的事。　縣長乃守土之官，要恪遵守土有責的明訓，此外對於整頓警察是有迫切的需要，對於田賦征收實物，也是一件重要的工作，希望各縣署長依照規定辦理努力推行，如果當地有困難，隨時可呈請市府核辦。</p>
<h3>電流因故中斷時　用水補救辦法　建設局積極計劃中</h3>
<p>本市建設局，近對市民用水及衛生設備，恐在電流因空襲而中斷時，聞已作積極有效之計劃。記者爲明　該局最近進行情况計，特走訪徐局長，提出各種問題，承一一解答。茲紀錄於後：</p>
<p>開掘公井</p>
<p>（問）本市如遇空襲電流中斷，自來水無法供給時，貴局有何補救辦法？（答）對於自來水之中斷，除散勵並指導民衆及早自動挖掘土井外，現巳計劃於　江河較遠之區，開掘大型公井二十口，業經市府核準，不日即可招商承包動工。比來市民開掘土井者頗衆，惟施工草率，致水質每多污濁，不合飲用。　本局爲提倡與指導起見，特製備掘井圖說，供市民諮詢參攷之用。</p>
<p>衛生設備</p>
<p>（問）倘電力中斷時，本市裝有衛生設備之住戶，因自來水無法供給，而使糞水堵塞，貴局將作何處置？</p>
<p>（答）此項問題，亦甚嚴重，本局原已計劃將各　水抽吸站及練淸廠之原有馬達，自裝發電機，使之拖動帮浦抽水。</p>
<p>（問）此項計劃不知須要經費若干？</p>
<p>（答）本市汚水鍊淸廠，計有東、西、北三處，其他大小抽洩站約有二十餘處，倘全部添置，及改裝自備發電機，預計費用約需五十萬萬元以上，恐非市庫所能負擔。</p>
<p>（問）改裝需時若干？</p>
<p>（答）設計繪圖約需一月以上，內各抽洩站之裝置，及馬力大小，均不一律，需加祥細計算與設計，裝置工程，約需三個月以上，始可完成。</p>
<p>（問）此項計劃能否實現？</p>
<p>（答）改裝自備發電機後，如遇電力公司電流中斷，自可照常工作，但發電機之燃料，以用柴油爲主，目前此項油類，購辦十分因難，而改裝工程浩大，頗費時日，倘市區馬路，忽遭空襲，污永抽洩管被阻，或被燬，則以後抽洩工作，仍將停頓，故此項計劃，仍非根本辦法。</p>
<p>停止應用</p>
<p>（問）遺局　此曾作其他對策否？</p>
<p>（答）倘果抽洩工作停顿，則住戶之衛生設備，必須立時停止應用，免使糞便泛濫，爲未雨綢繆計，惟有勸告民衆及早自備木質，磁質，或金屬物之馬桶，以作萬一之用。</p>
<p>（問）但淸除工作，又將如何辦理？</p>
<p>（答）此點有關衛生局工作，當與衛生局連繋，力謀妥善應付。</p>
<h3>本市戶口粉　決按期配給　粉麩產量減少配量照常</h3>
<p>粉麥統制委員會爲輔佐民食之不足，對於粉麥統收統配工作，在此萬分困窘之下，仍積極維持原有統制政策，故本市戶口粉照常督促按期配給。據上海區粉麥統配處消息，本市戶口粉配給粉量，因收買小麥不易，粉麩生產量減少，而將戶口粉每人二市斤改爲一市斤，以維平民生計。現在米價飛漲，市民對麵粉需要更切，戶口粉配給數量雖不能增加，但在最近數月間絕對維持原狀，不致脫期。其配給價格當儘力抑低，不使增高。</p>
<h3>五期防空訓練　舉行入學式</h3>
<p>本市防空本部舉辦防空訓練所，於昨（十五）日舉行第五期受訓學員人學式，到本期受訓學員共二百餘人，由大谷教育長報告入學人數及本期學程，旋請顧兼名譽教育長致訓　刻苦耐勞，以自己貢獻於社會，爲社會服務，語多懇切，旋由來賓致詞後，乃告禮成。</p>
<h3>物評會協商　強化平價</h3>
<p>本市物價，最近兩旬以來，暴漲不已，均以一般投機市儈，操縱居奇，刺激人心，影響社會經濟安定，誠匪淺鮮。市物價評議委員會對主要商品及次要商品之門售限價，曾於上月下旬召集會議討論，原定於本月初旬再度召集評議會議，作最後之決定，惟以近日物價激變更厲，早晚市價相差懸殊，若一旦　定限價，而各業為號不能遵守，執行效能，不得澈底，殊有礙行政之推動。故評議委員會現正與各有關方面連絡，俾使商品來源有充分準憊，而收强化抑平物價之效。</p>
<h3>錢業　增加手續費</h3>
<p>本市錢莊業聯合準備庫，鑒於錢司比方，已允於本月十六日結付之日起，增加五分，連前共爲二角。同業各莊手續費（即票貼）雖於去年底訂爲每千元最高爲六角，但目前物價騰增，開支日鉅，爰亦准各會莊之請，定自本月份起，各莊對於該項手續費，改爲每千元最高額爲一元，並經通告各莊照辦。</p>
<h3>票據貼現　變本加厲</h3>
<p>本市　頭，支票，撥款單等貼現之風，近更變本加厲，貼現率之增漲，尤足驚人。據悉端午節前一日及其當日，票據貼現率曾由一角及一角二分突躍至二角五分，昨日雖漸稍問，但仍在一角三四五分之請，此種不法利得，當局尚未嚴峻取締，貼現之事，已成爲公開之秘密，最堪重視者，貼現之現鈔，其中竟多爲原封未動之新鈔，各銀行錢莊每日向中儲滬行所領用之新劵，其去路不難立辦，按票據流通僞調劑市面需要，對於票據信用統應保特之不暇，何能任意領券貼現利，紊亂金融，剝削市民，深盼常局迅即取締，並澈究其來源，分別予以懲處，以敬效尤。</p>
<h3>中區職業靑年　選派受訓</h3>
<p>本市靑少年團第一區團部中區辦事處，自委派趙爾昌主持處務，業經正式成立開始辦公，積極在中區推行靑運工作。據開本市商會，業奉靑少年團市團部函請協助該中區辦事處主持之職業靑年幹部訓練，刻經商會分函所屬各業公會等幽體，選派優秀靑年受訓。</p>

<h3>滿副局長報吿　警政實施槪況　出席記者例會解答問題</h3>
<p>市宣傳處於昨（十五）日上午十時半，在市府會　室舉行記者例會，由市警察局副局長滿其蔚，出席解答各項問題，到各報社記者十餘人，先由滿副局長闡述最近實施警政概况如次：</p>
<p>最近實施警政槪況</p>
<p>本局自周兼局長蒞任後，對於刷新機構，調整人事，提高待遇，整飭警紀諸端，巳分別付諸實施，業經三月三十一日記者例會提出報告。茲將本局最近施政悄形，略述如下：　强化防空投施用免察襲損害　本局爲謀强化防空工作，滅除市民被空襲時損害計。除積極對市民實施防空訓練，加强防空各項設備，嚴密取締違背防空規定者外，並督導市民從速普遍建築簡易防空壕，挖掘防空　及水　，以　急需。</p>
<p>認眞管理娛樂塲所防止不法份子潛入活動娛樂塲所，如管理不善，輒易藏垢納污，致風化治，安均被妨害，經頒發管理辦法，通飭實施，幷嚴禁逾時營業，用鞏治安，藉節電流。</p>
<p>加緊整理交通用利一般行旅　交通秩序不良，易肇各種禍端，爲維特交通秩序計，曾派員於各轄區內，對各種車　燈火及音響管制設備不善者，巳實施檢査，嚴加取締，一面會同市建設局修正本市陸上交通管理規則，呈准施行，並出主管處組織車輛稽査班，　切實執行，務使秩序日善，行旅稱便。</p>
<p>强化治安標本兼施　滬市交通便利，避民　集，影響治安，至深且巨。本局爲强化治安，正本淸源計，一面令飭各分局隊，　加戒備，防止犯罪案件，同時幷將本市之　民乞丐流氓地痞及以犯罪爲常業之累犯，儘量拘送遊民勞働營，施以感化，用事生產。</p>
<p>認眞査緝烟毒促進國民健康　烟毒爲害，罄竹難述，本局爲促進國民健康，從事生產起見，故對於烟毒查緝工作，督屬加緊辦理。最近迭次破獲大批烟毒案件，分別解送地檢署及市保安司令部法辦，今後更當加倍努力，務期肅淸毒氛，解民倒　而後已。</p>
<p>擴大防犯宣傳期減犯罪事件　物價高漲，生活益艱，不事生產者流，易　犯罪淵藪，影響治安至巨，亟須喚起市民共同防犯，協力治安，故本局特組織防犯宣傳委員會，聘請各界名流爲委員，擴大防犯宣傳，俾減少犯罪事件之發生。</p>
<p>推進經濟行政期能安定民生　比月以來，物價飛腌，雖因物資來源缺乏，而商人囤積　　，亦爲重要原因，本局爲推進現行經濟政策起見，對囤　物資　　法　　者，　量檢舉及取締，用期抑低物價，安定民生。</p>
<p>訓練保甲人員協力本市治安以往保甲人員，已有適當的訓練，協助軍警工作，頗收美滿的成績，現更積極訓練，期能更進一步的協力本市治安</p>
<p>改善消防工作　際茲戰時體制，消防工作之重要，不言而喻，本局爲適應迫急需要，妥將消防處重要幹部，分別加以調整强化，並充實消防用具器村，使能發揮公而忘私的精神，完成消防救護之天職。</p>
<p>劃一官警服裝　本局係舊一二三警局合併編成，故過去服裝樣式各異，雖經修理，仍不一致，不特有礙觀瞻，抑且影響警容，本局今年夏季警服。係遵照國府規定式樣，由局統籌製發着用，以資劃一，而壯觀瞻。</p>
<p>增進警察福利邇來物價猛漲，官警薪津，無法比例，爲謀安定員　生活計，對免費之食米配給，力求迅速，並由　察福利社，儘量採講日用物品，先後　　售　本局員警，使其現時生活，得以調　，服務精神，幾續發楊。</p>
<p>擴充警察醫院本局自接管警察醫院後，即儘量綱羅技術優秀醫務人員，積極充實器材藥品，使全體官警健康上，得有保障，必要時並使該院担負市民之診療救護工作</p>
<p>獎勵優秀官警爲鼓勵官警益加努力起見，曾於上月令飭各單位主管，將所屬官警，嚴密老覆，其成續優異者，列表呈經核實後，已於本月分別晋級以示激勸。</p>
<p>加强警察教育警察素質之良　，靑賴教育之張弛，本局爲謀　成模範警察計，除對現有長警實施補助救育外，並强化警察教練所敎育，延　優秀教官，擴充教育器材，對於受訓官警，均施以極嚴格之訓練，警察之素質，已與日俱進矣。</p>
<p>以上數端，僅以施政梗概，在　於改善者，自屬多多。希望新聞界同志及各界人士，對於本局一協力，使吾人在周　局長領導之下，用我們的血汗，確保上海洽安，增進市民福利，完成戰時警察之使命。</p>

<h3>基本敎育講座辦理　義學書籤運動報吿</h3>
<p>今年四月間，木報組織義教委員會，創設義小十校，報各入學的學生，不數日間，即告足額；當時除略事擴充各校學額外，因格於財力物力，未能盡量增添班次。基本教育講座同人，鑒於教育係百年樹人大計，關係國族前途，至爲重大，於是經幾度集議，在「搶救失學」前提之下，發起推行「義學書籤運動」，目標預定二百萬元，辦法凡捐助義學金五十元，贈送精美書籤一分，以誌紀念。當時愿意，除徵集上述預定數量義學金外，並藉以喚起社會對於義敎事業的興趣與關注；我們認爲敎育事業是整個社會事業的一部份，祗有社會各界同起共舉，才能克底於成。書　推行以來，　承社會人士，敎育界先進，及各校同學熱忱贊助，計銷售書　七萬另三百三十一份，每份捐款五十元，實收國幣三百五十一萬六千五百五十元，內付去印刷紙張費三十萬四千八百元，絲帶十六萬五千三百七十五元，及雜項六千九百十元，尚餘三百另三萬九千四百六十五元，（已先後解交本報義敎會保管），超過預定目標。成績圓滿，同人至爲愉快。</p>
<p>這裏特別値得一提的，這次推行　學書　運動，工作人員都是由現任小學教師，木報義小敎師擔任的。他們利用　有的業餘時間，像推行書籤，收取款項，統計數量，結算帳目等，東西奔波，不辭辛勞；此外，各校校畏教師們，或贊助推行，或不吝賜敎，使這次運動有　滿的收獲，我們謹致最高的敬意和謝忱。</p>
<p>現在書籤運動已全部　吿　　。下　是各　　捐助的名單·尚希社會公　爲幸。</p>

<h3>九州第一綫視察記</h3>
<p>承當地陸軍地上部隊的好意特許，我（今城報進班員）曾到守備本土的九州第一綫陣地去視察。此行所得，第一點就是第一綫部隊殲敵的決心和自信，這可由華（譯臂，以下問）部隊長的言辭來代表，他說：「九州的邀擊戰鬥，本質上異於塞班及其他。敵軍如圖來寇九州本土，將在海上遭過殲滅的厄運！而且，縱能　綱而過，亦將被殲於水際。萬一徼倖登陸，必將擊滅淨盡，殺得其片甲不圓。」華部隊長的話，是依據千錘百辣的將士的鬥志，以及固若金湯的防禦工程這兩大事實而發的。站在爾臨浩瀚大洋而布陣的九州要塞第一綫的一隅，環顧四周，使我十分感動，更加堅定了必勝的信急。茲在許可的範圍內，將視察的經過報告如下。</p>
<p>努力建築洞窟陣地</p>
<p>部隊最初着手的，是地下要塞的建設。在血汗交流之下，辛辛苦苦構築司以耐受任何艦砲射擊，飛機轟炸的洞窟，數壕等陣地。將士們一有空便孜孜挖洞，將訓練以外的餘暇奉獻於陣地的整備，如果有人茫然閒立，即會聽到這樣的話：「喂，掘洞去！」將士在與敵兵交鋒以前，先與泥砂作戰。</p>
<p>工事民經大半完竣，日常生活都移於洞窟中。現在，更於遠大的計　下繼續推進築防工程。起於不是那個拉巴荷爾部隊的重視嗎？對於洞窟陣地建築的努力，是大的。在「徹底戰塲生活」的隊訓下，將士們日以繼夜的不斷挖掘。某士兵爲完遂自己的責任起見，曾不休不眠的掘了十天，終於生病了。但他還不肯罷手，避過了看護的眼，偷偷跑進洞窟裏，又揮支鶴嘴鍬。其他士兵，有人想出了搬遝砂土的新方法，效率因而提高三倍。在如此緊張的狀態下，要想洗澡或過悠閒的生活，簡直是無望的</p>
<p>「已有十天未洗澡啦！可也不想洗。」某士兵這樣說。</p>
<p>山中生活忘記日子</p>
<p>「今天是幾時？過着山中似的生活，連日子也忘記啦。」一個士兵拉住我，搔搔頭皮問道</p>
<p>雖說是本土，然在這些勇士們的生活裏，並不是本土，而是未來的戰塲</p>
<p>附近地方的住民，並不袖手旁觀將士努力，他一們組成動勞奉仕隊，每生則運用轉　經緯儀等器械，從一測　。</p>
<p>「工作」少，學生就不開心呢！」育隊長笑道</p>
<p>爲陣地所限的兵力，將充分發揮其全力，同時利用地面上所有的東西，加以種種獨特的設計，使成堅强的防禦工程。陳地不單爲了防禦進攻，同時也是積極的攻擊陣地，可發揮全力，猛攻敵軍，塲盡用兵之妙。「防禦亦必包滅攻擊的銳氣，確保主動的地位。」戰陣　言的一節於此是實現了。而且，肉搏攻擊，敢死衝鋒，更是這支部隊拿手係作中的特擅本領。時機一到，部隊長以下全體將士，即將肉搏　鋒，完成死守國土的大任。</p>
<p>枕戈以待挺身赴難</p>
<p>第一綫部隊的訓練，其劇烈的程度絕於想像，壯烈不亞於實際戰鬥。這批摩拳擦掌，枕戈以待的勇土，意氣是豪壯的。從標　「挺身赴難」的隊訓的陣地，指着通往某某的要道，郭隊長凜然說道：</p>
<p>「戰　將會由此而來。可是，無論怎樣，這條路是不許敵兵通過的！」</p>
<p>呵呵，多堅强的要塞，多可敬的決心！</p>
<p>一方面，雖然建設工作甚忙，但在繁忙中仍設法就地等辦食糧，在「自於廣大的田野問栽培甘　和蔬菜，現正着着進行中。此外，並從事採取止血用的艾，治腹痛的胡黃連等藥草。（今城報道班員）（譯自每日新聞）</p>
<h3>以死完成任務</h3>
<p>告別了靑葉叢叢的基地宿會，振翼飛向戰塲的特攻隊，其隊員的心情固然是可歌可泣的，但負責捕護他們的戰鬥機隊員的胸懷，也是悲壯萬分的。富永少尉（明治大學出身，家注東京都九新井）的担任掩護冲繩作戰的初期特攻隊，還是第一次上陣。最近，他對我說，三日以後他又有別項任務了，同時將一篇文章給我。當天晚上，他就離開此處，飛往前進基地。下面是他的文章。——大沼特派員誌</p>
<p>我與友機任務各別</p>
<p>以死完成任務，在我們是認爲無上壯美的。譬如我掩護的勝侯少尉機，就很美滿的以死完成了他的任務。不過，我是不可以死於掩護友機的任務的，我必須查明友機的戰果，否則就是我的恥辱。</p>
<p>接到命令的時候，是四月×日。特攻隊與掩護隊的飛機，數目相同。據報告，敵機動部數正護送一大船團前往冲繩本島。特攻隊的攻擊目標，是數方運輸艦。由於種種關係，特攻隊和掩護隊是從各別的基地起飛的。特攻隊的隊長是可敬的白井中尉。</p>
<p>緣色的大地，靑翠的山嶺，全在黑暗中。祗有基地的信號燈可以閃閃望見。奉命由我掩獲的，是勝侯少對所駕的特攻機。如果早就知道這事的話，我一定要請教他最後的遺言。不過，我雖聽不到，想必他在離開故國前是早巳對其母親說過了。我接到命令時，非常快樂，也準備與敵艦一同斃命。我沒有什麽想說，祗感到以死完成任務的崇高。前一天晚上，當我喝着酒，並接受勝侯少尉的遺物時，被報道班員釘住了看，實在有點兒忸怩。</p>
<p>越過海面飛往戰塲</p>
<p>隊低編好一望，掩護機少了一架，但特攻機全數飛了起來。夜尚未明。越過漆黑的海面，一直綫飛往戰塲。目的地是進弋慶良間各島周圍的敵美船幽上空。敵船的位置，不必我們苦苦導找，因爲是黑夜，迎擊的敵機不會飛上來，敵人如果放射對空砲火，那末就必　明其位置了。不過，船和島必須區別淸楚，這是很要緊的，如果弄錯了，而向無人島　去，那可不威事了。然而，關於這一點，祇要細心，也是沒有問題的。我們飛抵目的地後，未幾天就有點亮了。海上的船團頗可　　查明。</p>
<p>因爲光綫還不強烈，尚不能擊看淸勝侯少尉機的座席，祇可望見機體的輸廓。他一面避過了數彈，在高度〇〇公尺處，找到了絕好的目標。他搖着翼，俯下機首。</p>
<p>「拜託，拜託。」這時，突然有一很利害的衝擊，原來是敵彈炸裂了。勝侯少尉的飛機科正機首角度，立即倒衝下去。在照明彈的光芒下，向海面一望，確有航空母艦。可是，勝侯少尉告訴我說：「我向大型運輸船撞去」，並不狙擊那艘航空母艦。此因若和別的特攻機同樣進攻一個目標，是沒有意義的。而且我們的任務是在充分破壞敵上陸兵力的補給物資，所以對準了一敵船團。</p>
<p>死於任務生於任務</p>
<p>死於任務，其實也就是生於任務。負掩護的任務出發，目覩敵船就在眼前而不得擊沉之，必須違願的歸來，實在是一件痛苦的事。我等待着與敵艦同歸於盡的日子。</p>
<p>出擊的友機中，有一架是自炸的，那就是桂木氏所駕的飛機。據地上人員的話，起飛時他機上的一個補助汕滿掉了下來，雖拍電叫他回來，他部不肯飛回，因他認爲不能參加是不名譽的，所以不準備生還了。就在那個時侯，他已決心和敵船拚命了。</p>
<p>當我看到友機突入時，也決心跟着衝下去。可是，我的任務不是攻擊，而是掩護友機呀。因此，祗好忍住了。（譯自讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>冲繩及其周圍形勢圖</h3>
<p>冲繩島最近戰事，以南端之那霸，首里附近之小　，事武　，世名城一幣最爲激烈，至於實海岸島尻地區之知念，玉城，當盛，凑川等地，兩軍始終在對峙中。敵軍爲掩飾戰局困難起見，已將海上航空部隊參加作戰，　向日木本土及台灣等地濫施實炸，但日制空陣堅如鐵壁，益以前綫與後方之協力，使敵機動部隊無法活躍，是以日軍對於今後作戰勝利之把握，更爲堅定。</p>
<p>上海市政周　　題</p>
<h3>怎樣掘井</h3>
<p>— 鄭定邦</p>
<p>時至今日，上海的遭受空裝，已經成爲不可避免的事實，所以市民對於開掘土井，巳是迫不容緩。因爲在空襲的時候，各種公用車業，如電氣煤氣自來水等等，皆有隨時中斷的危險。就水電而言，自電力限制以後，尚有電燈的代用品如油燈，臘燭，電石燈等，都可補充使用，所以一旦電力亭止，對於市民的日常生活，似乎影響尙少，至多覺得不方便罷了；尚若自來水中斷，那麼無疑地我們將立刻感愛到嚴重的威脅和不堪設想的後果。</p>
<p>上海市民的飲料，洗滌和消防等用水，一向依賴自來水，不像內地一般的有潔凈淡味的河流池沼及土井可以利用，所以一定要趕快的開掘土井，以防萬一。同時目前自來水用量因節省電力關係，亦已隨之縮減，致京用上頗感不便，夏令到來。用水自必較多，爲謀補救自來水的不足，亦應及時掘井。</p>
<p>現在各處開掘土井，確已很多，但是水質難以使人滿意，因爲有的人貪使宜，並且無人指導監督，任由掘井商隨意亂掘，有的人雇用並未向建設局登記之掘井商工作，以致成績惡劣，是則徒耗人力物力，對於實際毫無裨益。</p>
<p>土井不適應用，除了上列人爲的原因外，地質上亦有關係，因上海的地，在離地面下約二公尺，常是污泥垃圾煤　等物，間或亦有陰溝污水管等存在，如在這種地方，開掘土井，而用普通磚瓦盤砌，那麼水源十九不會淸潔，旣不能飲用，亦不適合洗滌，有些水源在表面上雖不污濁，但因爲開掘太浅，積水有限，以致稍汲即將水攪渾而成泥漿，不能應用，結果亦成廢物。所以我們要使所掘的井，無論飲用，洗滌，以及消防方面都能合用，必須要注意下列各點：</p>
<p>掘井地位，以距離厠所溝渠或其他污穢塲所，愈遠愈佳。至少在三公尺以外，如開掘時遇污泥層，垃圾　或污水管時，最好易地重掘，否則另謀補救辦法。</p>
<p>掘井不宜太淺，深度至少在五公尺以上，如開掘相當深度，即遇流沙時，最好易地另掘。</p>
<p>井之內壁，至少上半截，約二公尺左右，須以不透水材料構築，以免污水流入。</p>
<p>掘井完竣後，應用明　設入水中，使水中雜質沈澱井底。</p>
<p>如需滅菌消　，最簡便的方法，可加百萬分之一的漂白粉於水中（漂白粉愈新愈　，消毒的方法本很多，不過有幾種方法，在普通情形下是不易辦到的。）</p>
<p>必須　用已向建設局登記之掘井商執行工作。</p>
<p>現在更具體一些，把幾種井的圖樣說明如下：</p>
<p>（甲）掘井時，甫經開掘即得黃泥層，且無溝管或汚水管通過，那麼，這個井的水源，大概可以淸潔合用，在這種情形下，井的四周，不妨純用確塊或瓦片盤砌，以節費用。</p>
<p>（乙）如掘下地面，即爲汚泥　或垃圾層，或附近有污水管通過時，最好能易地重掘，如爲地位所限，那麽井的上段約二公尺處，其四周必需用防水材料購築，以避污水流入，防水部份必需深入水面以下，防水部份，最好用鋼筋水泥三和土瓦筒，但因目前材料缺乏而價値昂貴，可用一·二水泥黃沙謬漿砌瓠壁，並於其表面用水泥黃沙粉刷，下段可仍用瓦片或磚塊盤砌。</p>
<p>（丙）土井的四壁，如能上下完全用防水材料築砌，井底不用木板，改用沙瀘層，（最下一層爲組石子，依次向上爲細石子，粗沙，最上層爲明　或明　和石灰混合），如比構築的井，四周汚水可絕對不致流入，不源純由井底黃泥層經過沙濾層上湧，那麼，這裏的水，一定是很淸潔適用的了。</p>
<h3>市政諮詢會建議　寬放用水限量</h3>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會，近有關於本市自來水限量問題議案一件，已函請市府辦理。茲探錄如后：</p>
<p>最近報載自來水減少用量三成，屆茲夏令，天氣日漸炎熱，市民用水，自須增多，水爲人生一日不可或缺之物，自來水劇烈漲價，並限制用量以後，則市民不得已只有　減少洗滌，　節水量。　改向江中汲水或用井水。夫減少洗滌已足妨碍衛生，而江水井水，未經科學消毒，飲用以後，易生疾病。當茲米價狂漲之時，市民營養已感不足，抵抗力原極衰弱，安能再受不　飲料中病菌之侵襲，其能免於疾病死亡者幾希。用特建議，擬請貴府迅予轉行華中水電公司，法商水電公司，並令飭建設局，即速糾正，維持夏季原量，以應市民需要。</p>
<h3>法令與生活</h3>
<p>— 一警士</p>
<p>月前跑馬廳槍決兩枉法警士，全市人民聞訊，莫不鼓掌稱快，面當局這一種法令如山的斷然處置，的確是可以殺一儆百，做到整頓吏治，肅淸貪汚的效果的。</p>
<p>肇者也是側身警政的一員，對於這種害羣之馬的消除，一方而感到無上欣慰外，一方面也感到無限的慚愧。</p>
<p>溯周兼局長長政以來，首先即着重於警政人員生活的改善，以最低能維持每一人員家庭的生活開支爲標準，因而加薪二倍半至三倍半，免費配給食米二斗半至六斗，以及辦理福利社配給平價日用品等，使每一個警員都能安於生活，而進一步做到忠於職守，在當時這種待遇，的確可以稱爲相當的優厚了，因而這一時期的警政也漸漸步入正軌，一般平日貪贓枉法的警土們也能稍知歛跡。</p>
<p>然而，到了現在，物價是在直綫上漲，而警員們的待遇，還不過仍舊如此，以當時的物價和現在來比較，却巳相差了幾倍，因而從前能够維持生活的薪金，到了今日，也要感到應付不來了。這確實是一個値得硏究的問題，警員們的生活不能維持，對於職守方面自然不能忠一，甚至於因爲開　不　，而儘不顧法令，藉職務上的便利，非法勒　，這樣一來，非但不能維持治安，相反的却要使治安受到　亂。所以，希望當局能儘速替我們設一個救濟的辦法，使我們能夠安心工作，而不至於有干當局的法令。</p>
<h3>關於防空壕的意見　其一　建築務須堅固</h3>
<p>每天晚上回家的路上，那一高一低的泥堆，不停地在脚下溜過，道便是保甲當局所掘的防空壕。</p>
<p>一月多前，經過嘉定路時，路旁的一座防空壕，起了很大的裂縫，並且起了彎曲，深覺這防空壕支架的力率（Mcmenl）不能負擔全部的外力，別說空襲，便是平時一無外力（空氣的壓力及風力等天然外力不計）時，短期內也有坍倒之處。</p>
<p>目下防空壕的建築正在進行中，除主要的由政府完成，大部份尙未完成，及至最近，由保甲方面收每戶捐警防捐若干，來完成這未成的防空壕。趁這未建築之前作下面的一點意見，給保甲方面一點參考。</p>
<p>防空壕中的支架，在可能範圍之中，用相木料爲原則，不得已時用代替品，但注意其力率（Momenl)。</p>
<p>防空壕上覆蓋的泥土，不使有裂縫或洞限。</p>
<p>防空壕完成後應有自警團負責，勿使頑童搗壞。</p>
<p>注意防空壕內外的整潔。（苒萃）</p>
<p>其二　容積不宜太小</p>
<p>上海市防空壕的建築，到處星羅基布，以適應防空的需耍。現在各里弄中又在鳩工建築「小型防空壕」了，像設們久安里，每宅須攤派到二千一百五十元，捐集總數也很可觀！不過筆者所見到的「小型防空壕」，却比開自流幷大不了多少，好像鄉間小孩的墓壙，小得太不成樣子了！如過一旦遇到緊急的空製時，試問大家倉皇鎭進小型防空壕中，如何擠軋得下？</p>
<p>我希望主持其事者應該加以寬放長度，而深度亦須再設法加深，至於闊度，　因里弄狹隘的多，放闊有礙　里弄交通，照八仙桌式的闊度，似尚滴合。其次在小型防空壕，未曾完工之前，而窟窿已經開好，殊多危險１祿里　嬉游的孩童甚衆，恐易傾跌壕中，有罹重傷或跌斃之慮！希望以木板或　席遮藍，外團劃以紅色粉綫，倘能插置一面「當心危險」的紅字牌十，則更善了！（羅漢）</p>
<h3>市立圖書館收費問題</h3>
<p>— 鳳岡</p>
<p>報栽本市市立公共圖書館，有微收出借費之舉，本人亦係市立公共圖書館會員之一，該館此次徵收出借費，係勒捐性質，其收據上有「承××樂助一百元正領謝」等字探。該館同人以生活困難，入不敷出，欲謀藉此貼補，俾得安心服務，其用心誠未可厚非，而其手段則大　矣。</p>
<p>爲今之計，該館亟應取消徵收「出借費」辦法，另謀合法開源節流之道，則淸寒會員，幸莫大焉。</p>
<p>至於開源節流辦法，管見所及，有下列二點：</p>
<p>呈請市府增撥經費，按圖書館係文化事業，關係社會敎育至鉅，今市府旣對小學敎員，新聞從事員等文化工作者之生活，努力設法改進，則對此圖書館員之生活問題，亦應加以考慮，以適當調整其待遇。</p>
<p>裁撤冗員，該館館員爲數甚多，而辦事效率至小，辦理借書還書手續時，往往有互相談笑，對鵠侯之會員，視若無暗等情形，苟能裁去辦事不力者，其薪給即以發給動勞服務者，則效率得以增進，而館員之生活亦得以安定。</p>
<h3>請當局開放市立游泳池</h3>
<p>— 沂人</p>
<p>邇來因爲生活費用狂漲之故，除一部份投機得意份子出入娛樂塲所，以聲色狂歡之外，大部份市民感覺到正當娛樂太少之苦，因而想到去年市立游泳池（在北四川路底）的開放，對於市民的便利和恩惠。</p>
<p>想到那碧緣的水，那白磁的池邊，以及幽靜的環境，用一百塊錢（今年當然要調整）可以游泳，洗浴，休息身心，這種快樂，絕非厠身酒綠燈紅之人可以事受到的，而是際此戰時市民應該享受和可能享受的正當娛樂。</p>
<p>聽說市府當局今年不準備開放游泳池了，基於什麼理由還不曉得，我們建議如果不是游泳池另被別用的塲合，還是公之於民的好，因爲此事雖小，而於民衆對市政常局的愛戴和市政與市民的連緊上有相常關係。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望今年不開放游泳池這個傳說是不確實的。</p>
<h3>創設義務中學我見</h3>
<p>— 唐遠</p>
<p>讀第十四期本刋所載姚　君「創設中高等義務學校」文後，頗具同感。今日被拒絕於學校門外之有志靑年，眞比比而是。義務敎育，本應由政府常局勵行，爲敎育部本身之責任，尚不得云救濟。然而今日之義務學校，率皆由熱心人士創辦，與政府無關，是所以終於收效不宏也。</p>
<p>關於義務中學，據筆者所知，本報助學金大學生團契於二月前即開始籌備創設，主持其事終日奔走，至今則聞暫告擱淺，其最大原因，爲校址無着，因　廢食，終使全盤計劃陷於停頓，聞之不勝感慨。</p>
<p>對於已有之義務學校，政府不能鼓勵支持指導，對於有志創投者則又不能援助，此中國教育之所以日瀕破產而不能振作也。</p>
<p>不客諱言，創設中高等義務學校，已爲目下迫不容緩之急務，筆者除竭贓希望政府當局及社會各界，廣大推動。故不揣愚鈍，願厭管見數點，以作熱心人士之參考：</p>
<p>在現有各大學內由學校當局設立義務教育班，利用誤餘時間，由教育系學生擔任授課，同時得以實習，一舉而得。而所費無幾。</p>
<p>在各保甲區內，由保甲當局在本區各學校實行調查，假有空餘時間之學校設立義務中學，以作本區內失學靑年繼求深造之所，其經費或由保甲委員會支助，或向本區住戶勸　。事關公益，捐款者必不在少。</p>
<p>各向業公會於經費中特別提出一項，創設義務中學救濟會員子弟。</p>
<p>在各市立學校，由教育常局創設義務中學。</p>
<p>義務教育，本應由政府當局創辦。然時至今日，官民分野，社會各界·爲爭取自身福利，熱心者正大有人在，而此項救人救國之大事業，當不致虎頭蛇尾半途而廢也。</p>
<p>至於義務中學課程內容，應以與實際生活有關者爲主，其空洞無物或與生活隔離者，暫時不授亦無關係，耍之，使失學靑年在極實貴之時間求其所需，學以致用，則於學業職業兩有增進，問接推動社會向前，此義務中學之眞正目的也。</p>
<p>最後，願大聲疾呼，望社會人士共囊斯舉，導職業靑年於正軌，助失學靑年得繼續上進，普遍設立義務中學，以及中等以上各專門學校，使任何一靑年均有讀書求學之機會，則敎育前途，社會前途，國家前途，有厚望焉。</p>
<p>（繼者按：如承本市各校，熟心以校舍出借或出租與義務中學，可函申報義務教育委員會，不勝企　！）</p>

<h3>小鎭的人</h3>
<p>— 夏如</p>
<p>去年，生活在古老的小鎭，落英　紛的暮春，我到了那兒，剛又摸到熟悉的春之脚，却又回來了。</p>
<p>我不能忘懷小鎭的人，生活於太懶散的生活方式中，永遠在祖母的叮嚀下順從的人，然而却是親切的。雖有太多的廟和塔，冷穆像破瓷瓶上的古圖案，但站在甜薯地里聽鴿鈴據過，人就像剪影貼在綠油油的紙片上，迷迷的高空，伸得萬深更遠。</p>
<p>我不能忘記那個在孤獨的快樂中長大的女孩，每天她來拎去我的冰桶，爲我貯滿一滿木桶的淸水，眼睛很圓，在笑時似乎也有一顆淚珠在眼角內滾轉，隣人告訴我已是十五歲的姑娘了，却矮得像一只扁壓的南瓜。站在土坡上，我探手在她家的頹牆上採了兩顆靑紫的桑椹，她把眼睛瞪得更大了：「還我，還給我，－」執抝地扳住我的手，鼻子上的雀斑在晚汐下更淸晰，「小丫頭是在罎子里生的，長的，沒爹，沒媽，大閨女像個短腿癩蛤蟆，哈，沒婆家，喂，想出嫁嗎？」學着鄉隣們打趣的話，還沒成熟的女孩子突然地羞澀了，頭低了下去，我感到一種羞辱了別人的殘忍的笑，響着。她跑了開去，又停住了；撅起了嘴，把擔回去的兩顆桑椹使勁擲在我的臉上，又放浪地笑，做着鬼臉，滿足地跳得像隻兎子。</p>
<p>老爹是個沉默的祖父，有威稜稜的眼睛，早上却在柴屋外爲小丫頭梳髮辮，破藍布短掛下的手抖抖索索。怎能再壯健呢，撫養大了兒子，還得照顧兒子的女兒，嚇瞧着孫女兒茁壯的微凸的胸脯時，眞有一種夢幻的悲衰味，老年人的情感如止水嗎？不，當我離開那古寺前的住屋時，人們都傳說着：</p>
<p>在夜里這兒常出現個三四十歲的女人，黑而結實的，要飯的女人，昨天，星星閃限時，看見那女人鬼魂似地推進老爹的柴　，天剛朦朦亮，挑糞的鄕下人也曾說有個女人從這小徑走向街巷，嗯，沒別的，苦了那小丫頭。我不奇詫五十多歲的人的原始之愛戀，傷感的見這故事里的不必要的女孩子！是嗎？</p>
<p>現在我緊念到的是後院的年靑獨生子。</p>
<p>站在雲母片的窗下漱口，我先瞥見了他老鼠似畏牲的眼珠，含着滿口的水，我咕噥着：「早啊！」却沒有禮貌的回答。晚上，到灶下去取熱水，看見他倚在庭院的門框上，眼睛裏滿是熾熱的出嫁前夕的女人的渴望，很高的個兒，臂膀却是虛軟地垂下。－不必去指摘一個比你怯弱的人，－他又想避開，裝着親　的笑，我制住他，輕輕地，怕驚嚇了房東老太太的獨生子。那是個只有佛和兒子的虔敬的老女人。</p>
<p>「看月亮爬上那棵古槐樹嗎？　還是等第一粒星星出現在天際？」每晚聽見他幽抑的讀書吟詩的，在深夜那是比梆十聲更蒼凉的嗚咽，靑春被壓　的聲音。</p>
<p>「沒有，站着等上燈的時侯，再回屋子睡覺。」聽見母親迂緩的脚步聲，他訥訥地，當剛斷乳的孩子又見了母親的胸脯時，那種欣喜，在他臉上，在他更年輕的眼裏　出。也不說一聲晚安就隱沒在門檻後的黑暗中了，我走上石階　那個灰髮的女人後面跟隨着他，還有他們的長短參差的背影，在石板地上。</p>
<p>「一個永隨着母親，走向灰色墳墓去的年靑人！」不禁爲他常是械默和寂寞的神色發一聲輕嘆。</p>
<p>我眞怕聽見那鋼絲琴的擊琮，他最愛發揮那「秋江夜月，」凄慘地在無星無月的迷雨之夜，抖動如　婦的怨語。可是，誰知在那有燈光的窗下正是個二十多歲的生命！正是個需要愛與恨的生頭，可易被這一進進的深院鎖住了，被那垂死母親的手捏住了。</p>
<p>人們都設他是個最有福的年靑人，有屋子，田地，有滿橱的書，溫文而老成，其實呢，夭折於寵愛的母親之臨終前，永不思索外面的天地，是有福了。如果一旦摸索於更遼闊的人間，會折了翼。是嗎？</p>
<p>着那賣　老人的獨　。</p>
<p>小鎭是個水鄕，藕和　從伏天吃到中秋，　嘴的異鄕人就永不能忘掉那　過的採　的老者。</p>
<p>第一次，太陽還燃燒得似炭火，正在睡午覺，被那低啞嗓亂的聲音喊醒了：</p>
<p>「沙角　　，熱的　純菱，要吃哪，菱－」很奇特爲什麼沿街的販子，有如此暴烈的叫賣聲，　狺然地火勁。我開門跑去尋找，他正低頭走來，滿臉的汗水。</p>
<p>「四十元一斤，小菱三十斤，聽見哦？子有兇而紅的眼珠。</p>
<p>「結個長主顧，大的三十元，老頭子！」我還價。</p>
<p>「去你的，買不買　你。沙角菱哪－熱的－」那麽單純的口氣，揹着　菱的木桶走開去，向深巷窄衖。</p>
<p>中，我散步於田堤，走向他塘邊的破瓦屋。</p>
<p>「老頭，白天不賣菱給我，照我的脾氣，要敲斷你的牙床骨，可是，愛你爽直得沒根肚腸，所以倒來看看你的老伴，再來買幾斤生塘菱！」說得也委婉。</p>
<p>「買菱就買養，幾斤啊？三斤算了五十元吧！」把濕淋淋的蒲包　給我，不勝厭煩地坐下，吸着旱烟。</p>
<p>坐了整個黃昏，他不睬我，也不看我，像發見了一個奇蹟，他只向自己獨語，絮絮地獨語。斷斷續續。</p>
<p>「唔，走吧，希罕什麽，唉，明天去南塘躉菱，天下雨，……」頭偏頤着眼睛呆定得白癡似的而佈滿紅絲。</p>
<p>後來，我知道那是個被老婆扔下的老鰥夫。年靑的妻子在一個春天的晚上，偸乘着塘里的採，菱船，划到通縣城的橋下，跟等侯着的情人，跑了。</p>
<p>他把生命浸沉於酒沫里，咀咒里，怪僻而暴亂的獨語里，是一個受苦的，受着折磨的靈魂。是嗎？</p>
<p>小鎭的人，我有象形的心，却缺少一雙浮彫的手只是一年，可是有深刻的時間以外的愛情。如果又到了那兒，再看見他們，會泛起怎樣的心境？</p>
<h3>寄</h3>
<p>— 春宜</p>
<p>像春天的燕子，在偶然的一天，你飛到了這兒，只逗留了片刻，竟又翩然而去了。</p>
<p>這裏原是不該你停下的：腐爛的巢裏怎能生長純眞的小鳥？悶窒的籠裏怎能困束自由的雲雀？更恨的是：那欲將攫向巢中的無賴的手，那卑鄙地笑向籠中的貪婪的嘴險！我知道，這是你所不能忍受的。你滿懷熱望而來，慶運自己的獲得了職業，獲得了自立的美名，但終於你悟到這僅是無聊，胡塗的騙飯碗的所在，這僅是賣身式的「自立」！你更得耳聞目擊多少向你投射來的惡意的調情似的笑聲眼綫！你感到難堪，你感到失望，於是你只好又恨然歸去了。</p>
<p>也許你將痛苦着怨你目已：誰叫你有美滿的理想？誰叫你有淸明的頭腦？誰叫你有熱烈的情感？誰叫你有美麗的容顏？……你底聖潔的光繩的一閃，巳顯現了多少人底醜惡的內心；而常你底光輝失去，他們便又再來了一次醜惡的自供。你寂寞地來，悄悄地去，爲什麽沒有留下一點鮮明的痕跡，使它震攝着醜惡的一羣，更使它溫慰着那能惡的一羣之外，默默地摯愛着你的一個？你燕子的飛到這兒來，僅嘆息着無　可棲，僅怨艾着身受欺凌，然而你却不曾注意到那醜惡的一羣之之外，願和你以熱情互換的一個？他也有着那當使自己痛苦的不安於現實的性格，他也有着那不能自止的熱烈的心田，他也曾想到要脫離這腐　的所在，掙出個自由的身子，但是，爲了那更進一步的揭露黑暗，向它挑戰，懷着「不入虎穴焉得虎子」的信念，同時活下去的問題又無時不緊逼着他，於是他便挺直了腰板在這兒忍受了下去。</p>
<p>當然，他沒有理由可以設你比他懦弱，此他消極，爲的是他是勇子，他至少要比你在社會上多點方便。譬如說：就在他和你會見的這見，那批傢伙們底無賴的手興貪婪的嘴臉就不會及到他身上，相反嚇却可以他們作爲改革與抗擊　試刀石。更何况你俱有天賦的美貌，它雖能造成一個女子的驕矜，自負，但在現時現地，往往却會使你招致大的不幸；它看來好似能造成一個女子的榮譽，地位，但事實上却是你底發展的障礙。然而如果你能不顧影目憐，獨處自嗟，沉緬於虛榮，眷愛於脂粉，爲你底美貌胘耀於人前而喜悅，爲你底溫悄無所寄託而悲哀，那末你將更有爲事實而努力的決心。也許，你底家庭環境是不壞的，你也不曾有過什麼苦難的經歷。這平靜溪水一般，緩緩前流的生活，養成了你這溫柔嫻靜的個性。這是你匠優點，但也可以說是你的弱點。爲此人們會自你是慣於服從不知反抗的好女子，而以你底嬌羞韻態作爲無聊的欣賞；更爲此你便難堪於各方的嘲弄不敢視嘲弄者。面臨惡劇塲。正因你不曾生長在激流中，你沒有受過暴風雨的洗鍊，你便太當於芙麗的幻想，你便俱有純潔而脆弱的心靈。這幼稚是難能可貴的，它已深深地引起了那眞切愛你者的同情。嚇願用他底喚聲驚破你底美麗的幻想，他願用他底力量堅强你底膽弱的心　。他雖不能洞悉惡者的人雄，然而他是不斷地搜累着，前行着。無顧於後　，無計於成敗；但偶而寂實，前路的蒼茫。於是他想到了個人的愛，想到了個人的愛與羣體的爱的關係；於是他發覺他心上已深刻下你底影于，他已　默地愛上了你。</p>
<p>曾記得，不，那情長還似就在眼前：你低　　頭坐在桌旁，聽見同事們底竊笑的可惡的嘲弄，而不敢，也許是不層抬頭去看他們。望着你那可戀的背影，他幾次想抽空跑過來和你談談，陳述一點坦白的意見，但終礙於那些賊眉猴眼，得不到機會。也曾有一次，聽見你意思說不願禁在這兒做供人欣賞的花瓶，而願意去做一個能幹點教育工作的淸貧的小學教員。機來你又感慨於女子求職的困難，現時所給予女子的苦悶。他只對你同感地笑了笑，沒有設什麼，以爲以後一定可以有長談的機會的，誰知那一天復，就沒有再看見你底可戀的身影了！</p>
<p>你質的走了嗎？你眞的拾着破碎的幻夢垂喪而去了嗎？你就不知道這兒也有着値得與你爲友的人嗎？你就不知道可咀咒的時代正需要在可詛咒的地方去擊退嗎？然而這都不能怪你，你原是生長在自由平靜的天地的一隻小鳥，一經在陰暗的籠子裏，就失去你底勇氣與明智了。</p>
<p>像春天的燕子，在突然的一天，你又飛了回去。願那輕快而自由的翅　馱着　愛你的人底永久的戀情飛向廣闊的天涯吧？</p>
<h3>窗下草</h3>
<p>— 端木夢歡</p>
<p>在臥室裏的北窗下，我安放下了一張寫字桌，於是；倒可以寫些什麽和看些什麽。</p>
<p>白天，雖然陽光從不會　得滿桌子，但是；光綫倒也充足，於是我願也已定矣！我對它並沒有得什麽共它的苛求。</p>
<p>寫得或看得稍許有一些倦了，那米，放下了筆或書，看看窗前的一片藍天，就很可以調劑得無發倦的心神，以後是夏天了，那冉冉的白雲，一定就更能「遊目馳懷」。</p>
<p>假使，窗外能有那末小小的一片草地或花圃，最低限度也該有着那末的幾株綠油油的楡樹，或者是楊柳也好，那就更合理想。</p>
<p>可惜，我的居住此處，時間也次不會長，否則我一定會去栽上它幾枝，看着它漸漸的長大，我年靑的心情，或許會因此而更加歡躍一些。</p>
<p>有得了那些靑葱的樹，那末，少不了會招引得來一些「爲雀」之類，而也可就不愁沒有「鳥語」可聞了！</p>
<p>入晚，　疎的樹影伴着月色，映上窗慢，靜靜地坐在窗下，讓我品看如此的景色，那末，縱然我是一個俗人，但這時却不容我不雅。</p>
<p>在這一個時候，大可再檢起一支洞着，吹它　自己所喜歡的「春江明月夜」，那就更有　悄可找。——但，最相宜的却該是深宵。</p>
<p>同時，我也得會煮上一　「洞庭碧　春」，——此時此地次不宜用牛奶咖啡——而强　歡來　　的據一回天，談些我們喜歡談的話。</p>
<p>對於如此的「閒情逸　」或者會有人來　我「不合時尚」，但是，我想也何必一定要自巴整天的裝成那一謝「苦眉愁眼」呢？能偸得浮生一分的閒　，而相徵的讓目己這一口氣，我敢設那也次不是一件絕對「喪老」的事情。</p>
<p>近來，很有得一些「空暇」，旣然有了那末一個寫讀的好地方，於是，我就總把大部分的空暇，打發在「窗底下」了！</p>
<p>在「窗下」，我發現了我從前所沒有發現的天地，我得有了我從前所沒有的新的感覺。</p>
<p>這倒並不是「委本子」所給予我的。</p>
<p>我想起了「環境」，在窗下，我倒又想通了環境是的確能够變遷人的心境的，同時，我更相信了寫讀的確需耍着一個「好的環境」。</p>
<p>雖然，我有着的並不是一個絕對的寫讀的好環境。但是，我却滿足了，因爲能够坐得舒服，寫得舒服，　得舒服，也還有着一段靜的時間，和一方可看的藍天，——。</p>
<p>我還要些什麽呢？</p>
<p>還要的，倒也有一點，就是讓我長久一些地在這環境裏待下去罷！</p>
<h3>我和T．B細菌搏鬭</h3>
<p>— 羅沉</p>
<p>T．B的細菌像北國</p>
<p>九月裏黃沙天的廛土，密密層層</p>
<p>迷漫在整個的空間，，迷漫在我的身邊。到處都是細菌，</p>
<p>到處都是T．B的細菌，細菌像大風中的黃沙</p>
<p>穿過口罩</p>
<p>掠過鼻孔裏的毫毛，它——</p>
<p>鑽－鑽－鑽－向肺　的深處</p>
<p>向肝，向獨，向腎，向大腸…向人底每一價脆弱的地方</p>
<p>——進攻！我和T．B的細菌一同生活喲！</p>
<p>我的辦公室</p>
<p>面臨着鍋爐間的烟突，煤烟－碳酸氣－一氣化碳</p>
<p>窒息着我，和</p>
<p>排擠了新鮮空氣！我的工塲</p>
<p>躱在地下室陰濕的角落，</p>
<p>潮濕－陰暗－和悶熱，最優美的，</p>
<p>無與比擬的T．B菌的培養所。我的工人，</p>
<p>面色慘白，　得像　柴桿。練習生，</p>
<p>總是　着身子</p>
<p>——嗆咳！回到家，</p>
<p>半夜裏</p>
<p>可以聽見年老的母親痛苦的地聲嗆咳。</p>
<p>她底肺臟從小就爲T．B菌</p>
<p>侵蝕了的啊，我的弟弟，</p>
<p>害着肺T．B我的妹妹</p>
<p>害着腸T．B我的好友</p>
<p>正因爲T．B咯血，</p>
<p>不能去參加——</p>
<p>就在眼前的畢業大考！我的隣居的可愛的小女孩</p>
<p>上個月害T．B性腦膜炎，</p>
<p>死去了！啊！T．B的細南喲，</p>
<p>——到處都是它重重地</p>
<p>緊緊地</p>
<p>包圍着我，好像一支侵略軍</p>
<p>用致死的砲火圍攻在正義的城下。啊，不！我要堅强—堅强</p>
<p>——更堅强</p>
<p>和T．B的細菌搏鬥！</p>
<p>－像那民族的英雄</p>
<p>保衛他們自己的祖國！</p>
<h3>逆流　並序</h3>
<p>— 宋香</p>
<p>幾年來我始終沒有寫過一篇關於我自己所認爲不屑寫的文章，若有，我也在這幾年前把它毀減了。當時，我覺得一個人之不能征服它的環境，除了近世史上的拿破崙以外，不再會有不幸的事，使得「人定勝天」四個字蒙受意外的侮辱或破產的，可是，事實上失敗的形成，又往住把所謂「人完勝天」的冠冕給澈底的推翻和抺殺了。所以呢，由泰山之高以至於鴻毛之微，我相信，天底下簡直沒有一件事，可以憑了僅僅乎孑然個人的意志，去把眼面前的環境能加以改造和克服的，自古以來，在字典上，在蔚然的歷史中，一切如火如茶的鼓勵詞句以及足以動人的與奮話，過了那一剎那，就等於出了氣的酒了，我想這不是我的牢騷語，也不是我的　落感，蓋人生的不可捉摸，本就是這樣無形的受造化玩　而支配着的，你有力量，你可以暫時戰勝它，或永遠的被你征服着，但讀一遍中外古今的歷史，何嘗就有這麽一個人？寫到這里，我實在寫不下設不上了，僅可以搖搖頭嘆嘆氣說：「吁嗟乎！此人生所以爲人生也」。</p>
<p>五月八日一九四五年，歐洲的大戰終於由德國的乞降而結束了，一代偉人的希特勒竟於挽救祖國的　厄以至於致力復興的一段燦爛史績中，隨了當年不幸兩面作戰的覆轍，歸之於三十年努力，毀在一旦而逃走，非但沒有從撕破凡爾賽和約創造復興強大的德意志，就連二十七年的　痛，也在今天的命運中註定了加深的慘刼，我們雖不必以成敗論英雄，可是像這類的現實，無須比那歷史上的拿破崙，已經足够使我們寒心一切的努力是白費的，天下的事，何必再還講什麽奮鬥？不如糊糊塗塗的委之於自然倒也罷了！我在這裏爲惋惜天下諸如此類的事之餘，扌開始了自我的消極，再寫我自己所不層寫的文掌，這就是今天的「逆流」了。（以上序文）</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>以前開口閉口中傷人的人，現在百分之百的變了趨炎附勢的現實崇拜者了，我佩服牠們的抓住現實而適應環境，就同我自已不善於鑽營成了南轅北轍的反比例，過去我在任何的立塲上，沒有發過絲毫中傷人的語氣，更沒有這類思想在內心存留着，直到現在，我也還是沒有把被趨炎附勢之流所崇拜的人，目之爲一代的了不起的人物，可是就因此，我把現實給抹殺了，以至於人家現飽，而我却是飢寒，終於有了這兩　絕對不同的分野，我扌受到了現實的教訓，並且更深深的悟解人生的與諦。不必惋惜過去，也不必憧憬着未來，只要把握住利用着現實，對人生的價値就不愁估計得豁邊而自有做人的意味了！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>史記上所載　　衣錦榮歸的自述說：「余茍有良田二百頃，父兄妻嫂皆相得，余豈能佩六國相印哉！」這類話要不是這位蘇秦佩了六國相印之後有感而發，我可以斷言，司馬氏也不必這樣忠實的寫來替入出氣的，可是利用現實的蘇氏父兄妻嫂匪特已經跪迎郊外三十里，事後且一致同聲的說明當時所以加這位六國首相的自眼也者，無非指望他有「這麼一天」而已！你說此言無理麼？豈不抹殺了古往今來所謂「仁人」的居心，但不管說得如何，蘇秦肚里是明白的，祇要他一不「誤解」，我亦何嘗不羨慕得有蘇氏的父兄妻嫂呢！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>德鄰是一對此沒有受過教育還要頭腦幼稚的夫　，男的居然也　二三十萬一個月了，不過據女的說：「我們的開銷與不很了，一個號頭頂少洋錢七十萬」，他們有六個孩子，想來倒也不是胡吹，男的受十分「尊重女機」，所以視閻令如聖旨，而這位女的呢！簡直是「趙子能混身是膽」的巾幗英雄，整天不是打打牌　個一萬八千的「內助」，便左鄰右戶的張家長李家短的說說，頗具「得天獨厚」的口才，　駡人吵吵架，並且還有挑　對方之後，叫街　排解而定誰是誰非的傑作，街麼一到　口就是：「我爸爸在南京做官，你不得幫人說話，務必識相」云云，因此呢！她往往自命是「先榮的勝利者」了！可是，我們雖然忝爲緊鄰，妻就因了她感着精神上種種的壓迫，原因她對妻十二萬分的「體恤」，見了面就打聽我們的恥况，如此如彼，做做勉「太平時代」的談話資料，然成又朝朝暮暮的「致力」於　妻同我離婚，所以妻　我說：「你再這樣的窮下去，她將叫了巡捕找我去同你離婚了。」</p>

<h3>排球聯賽女組　三省全勝完成霸業</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>排球聯賽甲女兩組之實力介紹與夫形勢，前已　之矣。至目下爲止，女子組三省已完成　業。四戰四勝　得本屆冠軍，得價諸巾幗之錦標夢，亦好事也。甲組中北方面五戰五勝，尚有對自隊一役，對首席地位，可無動搖，得保常勝榮譽矣。乙組二部，加入者旣多，又以不巧，數逢天雨延期，一時尚少尉目。估計之，當以乙一部永安海友最稱實力雄厚。乙二部則華嚴爲較有可取，嗣後戰事尚多，容俟稍只端倪時，再作叙述。</p>
<h3>三省戰績</h3>
<p>第一循環戰勝新本　二－〇華嚴　二－〇</p>
<p>第二循環戰勝新本　二－〇華嚴　二－〇</p>
<p>觀乎上列耙錄，三省之四戰而四勝，俱以直落二淨勝他隊。於此可見實力相差太過。　三省獲得冠軍。　易如反掌。然嚴格言之，亦使該隊缺乏興趣。蓋球隊比賽，固皆希望勝利，但同時必須對實力相等者勝之，始堪稱快，並能得到球藝進步。如遇相差程度太遠者，勝固可喜，其不够興奮也無疑。故觀三省四塲球賽，隊員均未能發揮，雖勝亦覺無生氣也。因此筆者不禁發生感想。查上屆冠軍綠隊，非無成軍可能，又上屆之季軍志　隊亦有集合可能，因此希望該兩隊及時織組與三省隊並而成三，作一三角對抗，不爲女排球熱心之球迷所樂聞者，則儘可酌售門票，以充善舉。使木屆過于冷寂之女組聯賽外，加添一番熱鬧，且提高女排水準，有利賴焉。甚願當局及上述三省能否採納此一點愚見否？</p>
<p>對三省本屆之雄姿，實　介紹材料，蓋以石擊卵之局勢下，苦無發展。故總言之，全隊人材平均，攻守俱全耳。其巾幗九名各個技術，尚足供解剖</p>
<p>李波　十餘年沙塲老將，徐娘已老，典型確存。其反手扯殺一球，仍稱美麗絕倫。唯要其躍起　網，已見力不從心。事實上，李女士已兒女成羣，能有此精神，活躍球塲，彌足可貴，恐亦女運動員中所　見者。</p>
<p>陳梅貞　身爲該隊隊長，確具眞實本領。人高手身，網邊施叩，每發必中，誠神乎其技。本屆更以對方之無擋綱者，更見隨心所欲矣。</p>
<p>陸翠芳　陸小姐似不爲一般人所矚目，以其絕不食功，獲分機會遂少。實則彼之扶助他人獲分，共功殊不可沒。且重合作着想，更爲隊員最須注意者。故余以爲實一成功之球員也。</p>
<p>陳榴珍　乃梅貞之令姊也。一對陳氏姊妹花在排球壇上，久享盛譽，迄未稍衰。榴珍任二排右，頗能擊敲，以其齊力之足，頗具功夫。但本屆　見表演，在無從發揮之故。</p>
<p>沈梅影　本屆以史瑞娟之結婚而輟，遂由沈小姐主二排中。沈本與梅貞老同學，代表學校隊已有成績，固老搭擋也。其擅救球之外，其拍出之球，即可供梅貞施叩，彼此契默可知。故沈應與梅貞搭配，始能鑒其優處。</p>
<p>陳澤莊　係中國巾學之體育教員，體格標準，且以朝夕在此中生活中，乃有駕輕就熟之成績，唯陳小姐本屆未見有特殊成績。筆者每觀其作戰時，總屬另有心事者然，要亦以老將資格，願　人家一步，未可厚非。如　能努力以赴，共成績必不止此。</p>
<p>董健　亦運動員之老前　也。對　子軍極有拼究，此番受三省遵約參加地陣。但以其身體之日益發福，且因僻處三排一角，實無作爲之機　。觀其身手，一望而知老于此道於健將也。</p>
<p>陳揭書　三省隊救險球之主腦。陳小姐身材矮小，奔搶自易，且經騐充足，屢能出奇制勝，救得險球，而其拍出之球。落默尤佳。又陳之開球，允爲三省隊中最有勁，二步一擊，急而準確，爲一良好人材也。</p>
<p>樂竺思　以處于三排角隅，對方實力較弱，便少機會。故樂小姐每逢一塲比賽，雖在烈日之下，亦可見其一如未賽之前同。其技術若何，未敢加以妄評。唯樂小姐之始終含笑塲上，得失似無關宏旨，其運動精神，常于此中明悉矣。</p>
<p>甲組冠軍中北隊，俟其戰程結束，當爲之介紹。乙組各部，下週內必可有一稽考淸帳。本篇爲三省獲女組冠軍後之祝賀文也。</p>
<p>述評</p>
<h3>聯僑戰馬白</h3>
<p>足球聯會主辦的籌募教育基金足球義賽第一幕，聯誼戰勝葡商。第二戰在上週末舉行，由第八次福利賽對壘的自馬僑聯再度相逢。因爲兩隊的盛名所播，其吸引力自屬不差，又以槳價的突然提高，大看台二千元，塲內五千元，也創了新票價。所以收入方面，常然可觀，這對於教育基金的輔助，得益匪淺。</p>
<p>這一塲球賽的結果是一對一。照那天的戰情，許多人批評白馬能够力逼各一，維持到底，已够僥倖。但是我深覺得僑聯的前鋒始終有缺少智力的表演。他們不能用誘敵離位，更沒有準確射門的脚頭，所以對付他們的辦法，祇要守衛能用（Cover　goalarea）的方法。他們就祗能在老遠的區域內無的放矢，何况這樣的冷箭，已是白馬張邦綸所洞悉其來路。而且張的本領，眞配合應付，因此僑聯在上塲三分鐘時偶然的機會－自馬陣脚未定－偷得了一次冷飯以後，在全賽中雖然攻勢是那麽多，可惜前鋒基於上述的原因，便一無所獲。因此－我的結論，與其　白馬僥幸，還不是脫白馬的守衛看準了對方的球路，得在守勢中保持住着不失球。</p>
<p>再說白馬如何不能勝球，當然前鋒綫上缺少了戴　經·孫錦順·李垚三位將士。在　前，我鳴得孫李不出塲的消息，所以在上期本刋上就寫。雖然有李義臣吳祺祥補缺，也決不會比那東華五虎將的來得美妙。何况李叔臣沒有來，戴麟經又臨特因腹　缺席。於是用瞿永福羅　福來充任。這樣成了烏合的一條鋒綫，下半時更因瞿永福的受傷由韓寵根出馬，更顯得破碎不堪，試問如何能有攻勢？最後二十分鐘內，吳祺祥看到決難有發揮，而後方在多事之秋情况，退後助守，於是徘徊在前綫的買幼良和韓龍海眞有英雄無甩武之地的苦悶。但是在極少的機會中，不諭幼良或者龍海得球後’兩人便能連　進　，深入腹地，雖未能以底於成，所給予番將的威脅力總是很厲害的。從這一點作十推測，假定有東華五虎來出塲，對付僑聯那呆笨的守衛法，眞搗黃龍是易如反掌的。從上屆一直到本屆，這足球季節已經完結後的定論，我始終敢說，東華五前鋒，破僑聯的守衛最相當，逢葡商隊便會辣手。這原內全在懂得人家的路，更懂所以制止的方法的因果。</p>
<p>最後，附帶的有一點感想，似有不吐不快的情形，所以便寫在下面。</p>
<p>這是球員的舉止和觀衆的　謂　　，都不能使我有最　的印象。像　　　的受傷，當然他猛　中拑住台賽卡同時傾倒後，大家還在用功夫，台賽卡的用臂力來　傷，這都是彼此沒有運動精神。還有鮑　和　福伯的糾繩，一間塲，這兩人中間有着芥蒂似的，於是更加一般觀衆無謂刺激性的　　，幾乎釀成吵鬧事件。這類現象，我人希望以後絕對滅少，做到消滅。我們盼望球員應該謀球藝進步取得勝利外，更發揚最良好的運動員精神，使球壇的風氣不退而進，是所至禱。這更需要大量的觀衆來扶助，輿論界來督促。不識這一點，能博得各方面的同情否？（業餘記者）</p>
<h3>籃球乙組聯賽結束　幽鷺奪得總冠軍</h3>
<p>— 瘦人</p>
<p>篮球聯賽乙組，自三月二十一日開賽以後，計分七部舉行，經兩個月之角逐，各部冠軍，次第產生，乃抽籤舉行淘汰，其中總決初賽振源與飛馬之戰，飛馬獲得勝利。但振源因不滿裁判，提出抗議，當局鄭重考慮。後議決振源抗議不威立，乃得順利進行。其總決賽一幕於日前（十四日）下午六時，在四川路靑年會健身房舉行，由幽鷺與龍華爭奪，結果幽鷺先敗而勝，榮獲乙組總冠軍。</p>
<p>籃球乙組表</p>
<p>幽鷺龍華決戰情形</p>
<p>總決賽幽鷺龍華兩隊俱屬乙組中之翹楚，共水準不在普通甲組隊之下，且均延有籃球名將擔任指導。是役關係，旣有關令譽。不料開賽時，兩隊教練均未見駕到，實令人莫名其妙。待至上半時結束後，龍華佔先時，幽鷺敎練凱齊密洛夫趕到，乃密授機宜，果見一轉風勢，攻破對方之弱點，乃得反敗爲勝。終以三十對二十六榮應乙組總冠軍。於此可見指導之得力，其重要性可知，設若龍華指導，亦能臨陣，則勝負之判，或有未能逆料者。</p>
<p>按兩隊戰術，在上半時中，均採用五人聯防術，而龍華以舍作較勝，果爾佔先一着。乃幽鷺指導授以方法，即守時用人釘人制。蓋幽鷺隊員氣力較勝，當收事半功倍之效，而攻則用中路　進，並利用身材高大作籃下跟進，於是浪擲之下，尚能有跟進機會。龍華果爲所乘，仍　本　　穩打主義。假定龍華見對方採人釘人後，亦改變戰略，尤其進攻時能用高速度，則幽鷺未必能一如其心願也。</p>
<p>又該賽栽判原定金伯陶周　邦二人。金曾於隔日向常局請假，而周　邦臨時　卯。乃有人謂，或係周之有所懼怕，蓋鑒於邇來球賽之頻多是非。但據筆者觀察，用之執法極見功夫，且經騐亦甚充足，是以必爲他事所阻。乃是日臨時由劉荷生，黃存瑞兩人担任救判。劉荷生於比賽之前，諱諄對雙方球員，加以訓勉，結果頗生效力，兩隊僅在球藝上爭上下，戰術上分高下，並無粗暴及嘖有煩言之情形，是誠値得一提之收穫。</p>
<p>新軍幽鷺前途無量</p>
<p>幽鷺爲一支後起新軍，係聖約翰大學一部份學生所組織，並有體育教師區人隊名將凱捷密洛夫任指導。隊員以同學關係，給與相當練習之機會，果能進步較快。且爲學生軍，體格健碩。以此該隊熊舉成名，轉輾迭克强敵，而榮膺乙組總冠軍也。其基本隊員，大致爲下列六將：</p>
<p>王裕光—中等身材，任前鋒職，射籃奇準，爲該隊獲分之靈魂。</p>
<p>林鴻慈－該隊之中鋒，因高度逾人，故籃下截球，勝人一等。對於跟進獲分，尤有把握。林君對此道，訓練已久。臨陸鎭靜，難能可貴。</p>
<p>刁國華－衝鋒陷陣，勇不可當。惜乎射籃功夫，尚未臻盡善之境。否則，殆一上好之鋒將也。</p>
<p>沈宗雲－有運動天村，係籃排球兩樓人物。在籃球隊中，爲一能攻能守之全材，長力似稍嫌不足耳。</p>
<p>石存衷－此子奔跑有餘，看人奇緊，任後衛一職，極爲符合。以其年事正靑，當可望更上一級，勉之！</p>
<p>莊逸凱－頭腦淸楚，逢大敵而不慌，是其優點，頗能遠射，尚少把糧，倘多練習，始可得也。</p>
<h3>全滬棒球邀請賽　熊貓苦戰得錦標</h3>
<p>— 山苗</p>
<p>滬上棒球運動沉寂巳久，最近三年於夏季中雖有壘球聯賽，但我華人從未得有錦標。本年五月中曾由日僑及西靑當局舉辦一棒球邀滿聯賽，我華人熊貓隊亦在被邀請之列。此外尚有勁旅日僑隊·西靑隊·葡商隊等共四隊參加角逐。我華隊不負衆望，奮戰力克日僑，奪得錦標，實滬上有史以來，我華人首次得全滬棒球錦標也。茲將該聯賽經過詳悄錄下，</p>
<p>聯賽各隊技術平均</p>
<p>此次聯賽各隊中，在未此賽前，衆料日僑隊乃實力最强者，西靑次之，葡商又次，而華隊熊貓爲最弱，因在日僑隊中，名手甚多如捕手三浦乃日本明治大學棒球選手，而隊員均爲留美日僑，尤以投手植島，一壘手岩立，三壘手若武爲最佳。而西靑及葡商隊中各隊員均球壇名將，經騐豐富。故熊貓被衆認爲毫無希望之一隊。但開賽後，此四隊之技術毫無上下之分，因聯賽採雙循環制，各隊與他隊賽二次，均各勝其一，由此可見各隊技術甚爲平均，每塲比賽精彩百出，尤以熊貓與日僑之三次苦戰爲最也。</p>
<p>梁君友聲厥功最大</p>
<p>熊貓與日僑在第一次比賽時，熊貓以三比一慘敗。在此賽中，熊貓竟無一　出之球，此實賴日僑之投手若武君之投球。在第二次比賽時，熊貓爲報復前仇，由教練梁扶初君親自出馬担任守一壘。是賽緊張異常，熊貓投手梁友聲君，大施妙技，只見手起球落，其急峻使日僑各員女一揮空棒。三壘手及辦擊溫天華及溫瑞雄等均有極佳之演出，故以五比三大勝</p>
<p>是僑諸將臨陣慌亂</p>
<p>該聯賽最後由日僑及熊貓爭奪冠軍。是日也，外僑觀衆多於華人，在塲觀衆之賭勝負比數爲三對一，即多數人以爲日僑必勝也。熟知是賽日僑以植島爲投手，此公在第二及四局中，臨陣慌張，錯誤百出。例如在第二馬中，華隊溫端雄妙擊上一壘，在倫二壘時，植島急擲球與二壘手染川，誰知出手用力過大，球直飛外塲，而左實上野又漏接，於是溫瑞雄急倫歸壘而獲一分。又如在第四局中，華隊李啓騰利用短擊，植島趨前接球急擲一壘，又因慌張，用力過大，致一壘岩立無法接住，而要啓勝已偷至三壘矣。在是賽中，投手梁友聲復利用其妙手，大　其急而峻曲之球，致日僑隊僅植島曾於第六局中得一「三壘打」。令賽結果，熊貓以七比三大勝而得錦標。</p>
<p>熊貓苦戰精神勝人</p>
<p>在此冠軍賽中，除日僑各隊員欠鎭　外，華隊之精神實可嘉，該是賽華隊抱必勝雄心，非戰敗日隊不可，故在賽前教練梁扶初君再三叮囑以不屈不撓之精神奮鬥，始有獲勝希望。故熊貓各員，臨陣鎭靜從事，在第三及四局中運殺四次日僑之偷壘，身手敏捷迅速，美妙鏡頭甚多，大爲觀衆讃許，使日僑無法偷壘，徒呼奈何。投手梁友聲連擲殺六人之多（（Strike　out）後因脚部抽筋，仍忍痛猛擲。反之，日僑各員於第六七局中因失分過多，而無心　戰。故賽後日僑捕手三浦君嘆曰：「此戰熊貓之勝實精神勝於我人也」。</p>
<h3>籃球學理述要（二十一）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>現代籃球進攻法，雖如上述，然如何邇用，始能發生效力，頗爲重要之問題。以上各種戰法，程度較高之球隊，大多如此互相爲用。於每次在對方奪得遮板彈回之球後，必先採用快攻，乖對方之不備，或退守遲緩之時，用直綫傳球，遠傳與籃下之隊員　人，　　　「偷冷飯」。或用單人匹馬，急激放步，拍球直搗黃龍，向前投籃。用伏攻之目的，爲攻人之不備，或以二對一人，及三人對二人夾攻對方，尤以二人對一人，最爲有效。迨至對方已有三人退至後塲防守時，則快攻之可能性漸失。故於奪得球開始進攻時，見對方退守得快，防備森嚴，則不能用快攻，而須用緩攻陣地戰。一方面山兩後衛，互相傳球，傳過中綫，一方面由中鋒與兩前鋒，走向而塲，佈　陣綫，隨機應變，運用各種緩攻法，或延時政策。用緩攻陣地戰之主要目的，在破五人聯防法，誘騙敵人，離開位置，乘虛而攻。在比賽特間將告終，我方得分較多時，幷可用外圍傳球法，保持護球權，不用再攻而獲得最後勝利。但對方若聰明，必改用「人釘人」防守法，强迫我方進攻‘以便奪得我方失球，實行反攻。此時我方不得不改變戰法，用阻擋進攻術，而克制之。用阻擋法最要表，爲將主要之一敵，設法擋住，使之不能及時走出，奪取我方之球，使我方持球之人，得免敵人緊釘，　所定之進攻路綫，安然直衝籃下投進。擋人之法，切忌觸及對方身體犯規，及爲對方預先知曉，否則對方用互調對乎法，預爲防備，我方則全功盡費矣。不過　方見我方轉用此法，必然再採行五人分區聯防法，則我方不得不又用緩攻破之，此爲最普通之運川進攻法也。</p>
<p>攻防技　與理論，已如上述，但如何使之實現，　於理想，實有關手其他重要問題，爲指導員與球員，不可不悉心硏究者，爲指導員本身問題，一爲球員精神修養問題。茲分述如下。</p>
<p>指導員太身問題指導員如戰塲上，兩軍作戰之參謀長與總指揮。對於各種攻防陣勢，及與戰法遝用上有關之知識，應有澈底之硏究與認識。若一知半解，臨陣實難應付。故一位指導員，須認識本隊球員之技術，能力，生理與心理之狀態，同時亦須獲知比賽一切情形，如天時地利，及對方之實力與戰法。所謂知已知彼，方能百戰百勝。</p>
<p>採用攻防戰法，應以隊員能力，年齡，體格，體力，及個性爲主，務使戰法能適合隊員本身條件，不能有削足適履之弊。若攻防戰法雖好，而隊員能力不足，或戰法需費大量氣力；而隊員體力不够，或戰法需極敏捷動作者，而隊員年齡較長，個性遲緩，便昧於戰法之優良。　然採用，必政敗無疑。故無論採用何種優良攻防法，必須切合隊員本身狀况，爲光決之條件也。</p>
<p>比賽前應明瞭對方能力之强弱，動竹之快慢，及其所用之攻防戰法，以便規定本隊應付之方法。例如：過對隊爲　旅，我方須守重於攻。若對隊較我方爲弱，我方則宜攻重於守。若對隊動作慢者，宜用快攻。反之，動作快者，則應用緩攻陣地戰。其他如在比寒時，亦須時刻注意一切變化；如戰情之緊張與鬆懈，觀衆與塲地大小，地點與天時所發生之影響，及時間與分敷之差異。如時間尚長，分數相等；或時間將到，分數相差甚遠；或時間將到，分數想等。凡此種種關係甚大，應明暸其情勢與演變，隨機應付，改變戰法，不可墨守成法者也。</p>
<p>球員精神修養問題</p>
<p>球員除號力與技術修養，須　優良成績外，尚須注意其精神上之修養。精神修養，最耍者爲合作與奮鬥精神，茲略述之如下。</p>
<p>合作精神，爲現代　球運動頗重要之訓練。一切攻防戰法，有無成效，全在合作之能力爲斷，因籃球爲團體合力之運動，非個人游戲之可比。然合作雖非表演個人技術，但個人基本動作不純熟，雖欲合作，亦不可能。攻防戰法之失敗，初非因陣勢之不良，大半因缺乏知識，及個人基本動作生疏所政。蓋隊員基本動作無把握，全隊之動作，更無法聯絡。例如：接球者欲接球，傳球者傳不到。傳球者欲傳球，苦無人接應，或右機會投籃而不準確，或思想不敏，動作不靈，致爲對方　破。嚴加防守，雖有機進攻，亦不能達目的。諸如此類，均與合作有莫不關係。故現代球隊。首要在灌輸與培養合作精神。不但新球隊如此，即訓練有素之球隊，亦無不應如此。尤其所謂明足集體之球隊，其所以日入生懈，亦無不因祇顧個人技術表演及合作力渙散所致。合作精神，不專指在按術動作方面。其他如不屈不撓，不驚不擾，不驕不餒之心理與情絡。甚至一切舉動·言語·精神·態度等，均與合作關係甚大也。</p>
<p>籃鬥精神，亦爲今之訓練籃球所重視者。蓋籃球運動，屬於爭鬥性質，球員必須智勇兼備，幷且耍有奮鬥精神。兩隊比賽一來一往，雖技術方面，關係甚大，然太半須視乎隊員奮鬥之毅力，以爲決勝負之都鍵。故隊員應具有不屈不撓，再接再厲之奮鬥精神。從鳴笛起，直至比賽終結爲止，精神奮發，勇往直前，不爲對方壓迫，戰情逆轉而屈服。即使不幸因技術而失敗，但精神仍須一貫，始終如一。雖一分一秒鐘之鬆懈，亦不可有。如此之球隊，雖敗猶榮。切不可染祇能獲勝，不能失敗之惡習氣。常見若干球隊，勝利止在一髮千鈞之際，對方加緊追趕，成績接近時，隊員便生恐慌。功敗　成，被人制勝。此實爲成敗之　紐，且爲人人易犯之通病。此無非因奮鬥力不能持久，結果必致敗北。理應儘力爲之，不可因對方一時順利，致受威脅而氣餒也。</p>
<h3>體壇拾零</h3>
<p>女排球名將黃杏芬，將爲一個小孩子的媽媽，故排　塲上不能見其縱跡</p>
<p>白馬隊李垚因赴杭州比小型球受傷甚劇，有折臂之危險性。返滬後，幸經葉衍慶醫師悉心診療，可望全愈，預祝吉人天相，球塲上再見其縱橫</p>
<p>宣家班同仁籃球隊息影已久，最近重振旗鼓，歡迎件友隊約賽。</p>
<p>三省男排球隊健將陳效良，從未見其出塲。據云：因病日久，現已診治全愈，可照常出席比賽。</p>
<p>（懷　）</p>
<h3>全滬壘球聯賽　熊貓下週出戰</h3>
<p>熊貓於去年參加合滬壘球聯賽，屈居亞軍。此次奪得棒球錦標，可謂如願以償。本年度全滬壘球聯賽已於六月十日開始。參加者甲組達七隊之多，爲日僑·熊貓。西靑·　僑·葡商等名隊。熊貓此番奪得棒球錦標後，將於壘球賽中大施身手。熊貓已排定於六月十九日（星期二）下午四時半，在吳興路（舊潘聲路）（即霞飛路可的牛奶棚大風車之　路上）與武士隊（Knights）比賽。球迷可踴躍華隊之壘球作風也。熊貓在此賽中所應注意者，即武士隊中各隊員均善偷壘，且時喜用短擊上壘，投手李啓騰應嚴加注意爲要。又梁友聲將於壘球賽中任游擊手，其敏捷之接殺，球迷可大加欣賞。又捕手王秀山　亦將出陣助戰，同時溫天華，溫瑞雄諸壘手及外　王念茲，唐偉業，梁友文等，亦將大顯身手。（山苗）</p>

<h3>Dredging Rice Sources to Sufficiently Provide Food for the People: The National Government Adopts Emergency Measures, Allied Authorities Decide to Offer Full Cooperation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other areas, causing widespread concern among the general public. The government, mindful of the difficulties, has decided to temporarily halt the procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations. Simultaneously, existing restrictions on rice movement will be lifted to open up sources and facilitate circulation. These emergency measures regarding rice are truly wise, and the public's food panic should be rationally alleviated as a result. Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan has issued an important statement on this matter, expressing his hope that officials and civilians in all regions will understand and cooperate with this initiative. Furthermore, the authorities of allied forces and embassies have also issued statements, affirming their full cooperation with the National Government's measures and their cessation of military rice procurement. The original texts of Premier Chen's statement and the statements from allied military and political authorities are recorded below:</p>
<p>Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan's Statement</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have fluctuated dramatically. Mindful of the difficulties, the government is implementing the following emergency measures: The rice procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations are temporarily suspended. Existing restrictions on rice movement are immediately lifted. The purpose of this is to open up sources and allow free circulation, ensuring a steady supply of rice to meet the needs of the people during this lean period. The success of any policy relies on the cooperation of all parties. Anyone found violating government directives by extorting, obstructing, or engaging in speculative hoarding will be severely punished. We sincerely hope that officials, civilians, and military personnel in all regions will understand and fulfill their respective duties to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Statement from the Allied Forces Authorities</p>
<p>The National Government, recognizing the current sharp rise in rice prices, has decided to halt the rice procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and other organizations and to remove restrictions on rice movement in the Central China region, thereby promoting free and smooth rice circulation. In response to these policies of the National Government, our military authorities are also suspending all forcibly supported procurement of military rice for this year. We will further provide special assistance to ensure the smooth flow and transportation of rice for civilian consumption. We will also fully cooperate with the National Government in cracking down on illegal taxation and speculative hoarding. Furthermore, the military will release as much wheat and other grains as possible from our holdings in the interior to the Shanghai area to support civilian distribution. All of the above aims to provide a smooth supply of rice for civilian consumption and to stabilize rice prices. We are offering full support to the National Government's policies and hope that both Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians will understand and cooperate to the fullest extent to ensure the concrete realization of these policies and achieve perfect results.</p>
<p>Statement from the Embassy Authorities</p>
<p>The National Government has issued emergency rice policies during this lean period. The rice procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations are temporarily suspended, and restrictions on rice movement are lifted. The government has also declared that those who violate these policies will be severely punished. The Chinese Expeditionary Forces are also responding to this by halting military rice procurement and transferring wheat and other grains in military storage to the general public for distribution. They have also issued a statement affirming their full cooperation with the Chinese government's policies. This move is a timely measure given the current urgent rice situation in Central China. Japanese residents in China should understand the spirit of the statements issued by Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan and the Chinese Expeditionary Forces authorities, cooperate with rice circulation, and avoid any actions that violate these policies. In light of the current state of the Greater East Asia War, it is imperative that Japanese and Chinese military and civilians are sincerely united and advance towards the goal of completion. It is a fundamental principle of our new policy towards China to share weal and woe with the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Deeply Hoping Officials and Civilians Unite to Protect Rice Supplies So Panic Can Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The recent sharp rise in rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai is due to several major factors. These include the lean season, artificial speculation and manipulation, and difficulties in wartime transportation. In addition, the unsuitability of the existing rice control policies to local conditions and the failure of those responsible for grain administration to fulfill their duties are undeniable facts. The past control methods were complicated with too many procedures. Also, at each new harvest season, they failed to carry out overall planning and timely procurement, leading to various abuses. Petty individuals took the opportunity to exploit their public positions for private gain, enriching themselves. As a result, procurement efforts were ineffective, and they were unable to regulate supply during the lean season, leaving them to helplessly watch. In addition, the imbalance in military and civilian rice procurement is also a major cause of today's rice panic. Now, the government authorities, mindful of the difficulties, resolutely decided to temporarily suspend the procurement efforts of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations, lift the restrictions on rice movement, and allow free procurement, transport, and circulation. At the same time, allied military and political authorities are offering full cooperation to the National Government's measures and ceasing military rice procurement. They are even releasing the wheat and other grains they had already purchased in the Shanghai area for distribution to the public. The authorities' policies are truly wise and demonstrate their utmost concern for the stability of people's livelihoods. It is believed that after these emergency measures, the speculators will inevitably take the opportunity to run rampant and hoard supplies. In addition to urging them to reflect on their actions, we hope that officials and civilians will jointly monitor and crack down on these activities. We also hope that allied merchants in China will understand the importance of cooperation between China and Japan and provide full cooperation. All groups, businesses, and other organizations must not exploit the convenience of liberalization to engage in disguised large-scale purchases that disrupt the public's food supply. Local authorities in the producing areas must not restrict the flow of rice under the pretext of local needs to pursue personal gain. The general public should also share the difficulties of the times and avoid large-scale storage, which will only fuel panic and give speculators opportunities.</p>
<h3>Chen Binhe Goes to Nanjing to Discuss the Food Situation, Represents Shanghai Citizens to Petition the Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, causing great anxiety among the general public. Chen Binhe, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, made a special trip to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 15th to petition the central authorities on behalf of all the citizens of Shanghai and to jointly seek solutions to the food problem.</p>
<h3>Japan Unites Nationally, Displaying Fighting Spirit: Prime Minister Suzuki Clarifies the Path to Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Prime Minister General Suzuki met with a group of reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 14th to explain the Japanese government's determination and strategy in dealing with the war situation, as reported in yesterday's dispatch. Detailed information is provided below:</p>
<p>Question: What winning strategies does the government have for dealing with the serious homeland decisive battle?</p>
<p>Answer: At this parliamentary session, I stated that the Battle of Okinawa had entered an unfavorable state, but I only mentioned "unfavorable" without clarifying the future situation. I am confident that the loss of Iwo Jima and the unfavorable situation in Okinawa are not actually matters for grief. In the course of a sustained war, victories and defeats are natural occurrences. The outcome of a war cannot be judged lightly based on the occupation of a single location. Even if Okinawa is lost, future battles may involve landings in Kyushu or other parts of the homeland. However, if we maintain a strong fighting spirit and display a will to fight, we will force the enemy to use even more troops. Such a battle will inevitably be prolonged, and the enemy will feel that the long war is not worth the losses and will seek a ceasefire. Therefore, I do not want to merely focus on the Battle of Okinawa and weaken the nation's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Question: The Prime Minister has stated that the closer the enemy gets to the homeland, the more advantageous it is for us. May I ask what the specific policy is? Also, I wonder if there has been any change in your view of the war situation since you formed the cabinet?</p>
<p>Answer: As long as the morale of the nation is high, I have absolute confidence in victory. The enemy cannot land a million troops in one fell swoop; they can only land in succession. Landing 500,000 troops requires several months, and considerable preparations are needed for supplies. The US military landed a large number of troops in France in Europe, but the US troops only had to cross the narrow English Channel to land in France. The distance from the United States to the Japanese mainland is incomparable to that in Europe. The enemy knows this is very difficult. Even if they land, we have considerable defenses and can mobilize a large army. In short, if the enemy comes from the sea, we will attack and reduce their transport ships at sea. If the enemy approaches the coast, we will annihilate them on the coast. If they actually land, we will certainly annihilate them on land. We are at an advantage in terms of land-based supplies and can concentrate five to ten times the enemy's forces. This is different from past island battles. Regardless of how superior the enemy's weapons and materials are to ours, we must never feel inferior. This is the path to victory.</p>
<p>At this point, Prime Minister Suzuki left the reporters' questioning and issued the following statement: "Finally, I deeply feel that the current stage of the war is a gratifying matter for the nation. I have participated in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. At that time, the nation held fears of national demise, but they felt it was better to fight to the death than to perish without a fight. Their morale was extremely tragic. Now, Germany has finally been defeated and collapsed. But I ask, have the German people thoroughly understood the Nazi spirit? Did the German army fight with the Nazi spirit? No. The evidence is that there were no officers in the army who died gloriously. This is completely different from us. In the battles of Kiska Island and Iwo Jima, our army, whether officers or soldiers, fought to the death. The difference between the German and Japanese people, and between the German and Japanese armies, is significant. Therefore, comparing Japan to Germany is a great mistake. Germany, with such a large army, ultimately could not fight to the end. It was truly unexpected for Japanese soldiers. It is true that we may be inferior to the enemy in terms of quantity. However, once we are on the battlefield, we have a strong determination. This is a characteristic of the Japanese people. We will unite the entire nation and fight to the end with this potential."</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Supporting Emergency Rice Measures</h3>
<p>The central authorities of the National Government, in light of the recent sharp rise in rice prices in various regions and the serious threat to people's livelihoods, have decided to implement emergency measures: First, the rice procurement work of the Rice Control Committee and all other related organizations is temporarily suspended. Second, the existing restrictions on rice movement are immediately lifted. In response to these emergency measures, Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan issued a sincere statement, pointing out that the purpose of this move is to open up rice sources so that rice can circulate freely. He hoped that rice could continue to be supplied to meet the needs of the people during the lean season, to achieve the goal of stabilizing the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Allied Forces and Embassy authorities have also issued statements expressing full cooperation with the National Government's emergency measures. The dispatched military authorities, in order to respond to this initiative, will cease the purchase of military rice for this year. Further, the wheat and grains which have already been purchased inland will be released in Shanghai for civilian needs. On the other hand, special assistance will be provided for the transport and movement of rice for civilian consumption, and illegal taxation and hoarding will be jointly cracked down on.</p>
<p>We express our admiration for the wise measures taken by the Central China authorities and the enthusiastic cooperation of the Allied authorities, and we would like to make the following statements on the significance and impact of this measure:</p>
<p>The reasons for the recent rise in rice prices are the unreasonableness of the purchase method in the rice producing areas and the obstruction of sources in the non-rice producing areas. The emergency measures implemented by the authorities now are to stop the purchase and lift the restrictions on the movement of rice, which are completely targeted at the crux of the problem, prescribing the right medicine. We firmly believe that after these measures are taken, the reasons for the high rice prices will be eliminated, and the sources of rice will be dredged, and rice prices will stabilize and return to normal. In our editorial the day before yesterday, we hoped that the people would not panic too much about the soaring rice prices, because the recent rice price increase is unreasonable. As long as emergency countermeasures are quickly planned and the right medicine is prescribed, at least the unreasonable surge in rice prices can be stopped. Now that the authorities have implemented the measures and received the cooperation of the Allied authorities, the unreasonable rice price surge will inevitably tend to ease and then fall. At the same time, the general price increase caused by the rice price will also tend to stabilize due to the rice price stabilization. Therefore, the people's mentality can be stabilized from now on.</p>
<p>Now that rice purchases have been suspended in the rice-producing areas, the sources of rice in the non-rice-producing areas can be continuously supplied. The lifting of the movement restriction can also allow free movement and smooth operation. On the one hand, the sources have a way, and on the other hand, the movement is unrestricted, so the supply and demand can be adjusted. Our city's food supply is originally taken from the nearby rice producing areas. We hope that the relevant parties will take the responsibility of assisting and supervising the rice sources as soon as possible. Especially for the transport, it is particularly needed. Military personnel are not allowed to delay or demand rice movement, but should protect it at any time. Hoarding for speculation should be strictly guarded against. In short, all parties should work towards the goal of dredging sources and suppressing rice prices to achieve the purpose of solving food problems and stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also recognize the reality that the current period is a lean season. Even the surplus rice in the rice-producing areas may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all the non-rice-producing areas. Therefore, we reiterate that everyone should change the mentality of not eating rice and try to use miscellaneous grains. The allied authorities have stated that they will release the purchased wheat and grains in Shanghai, but we still hope that the authorities will plan to purchase the remaining grains from Huaihai to enrich the food sources of Shanghai citizens in many ways.</p>
<p>Finally, we deeply hope that officials and civilians will work together to solve the pain of the food problem in one fell swoop under the emergency measures of the authorities. However, in principle, it is unavoidable to implement economic control policies during wartime. Therefore, rice control is also unavoidable. The current temporary suspension of purchases and the lifting of movement restrictions are indeed emergency measures. We are determined to learn from the pain and must consider our inherent national conditions and public sentiment in the technology of future rice control and general economic control. We must take into account both military needs and civilian food needs for rice. Only with a control policy based on this meaning can we achieve the expected control benefits and effects.</p>
<h3>Japan is Prepared for a Decisive Battle on Its Homeland, Benefiting From Both Timing and Location</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The battle of Okinawa, the first line of defense for a decisive battle on Japanese homeland, lasting for over two and a half months, served as a prelude for battles on the homeland. It has been half a year since B-29 bombers began air raids on the mainland from bases in the Mariana Islands. The intensity of bombings has increased recently, with major cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, and large segments of the population across the country, considering the airstrikes to be a regular occurrence. Battles on the homeland have ceased to be an abstract concept. This awareness has become ingrained in the daily lives of the majority of the population. The nature of the decisive homeland battle differs entirely from that of isolated island battles like Okinawa. The homeland battle can be truly called a decisive battle, and the difficulties of supply experienced in isolated island battles will no longer be a concern. The initial success of the battles has been repeatedly explained by the military, attributing it to the disruption of transportation caused by enemy air raids. Nevertheless, by concentrating the full strength of the military and the nation on the battlefield, military operations have been fully promoted. The key to determining the outcome of a battle has always been the issue of maritime supply. However, during a decisive battle on the homeland, this problem of supply disruption will inevitably shift to the enemy. The Japanese army will be able to obtain adequate combat supplies and face the formidable American army, known for its excellent preparations, with comparable forces. This is based on the experience of repeated battles. Even in the Battle of Okinawa, conducted under the unfavorable conditions of the enemy's command of the sea and air, the Japanese army destroyed three enemy army divisions in the first half and inflicted significant damage on three newly arrived Marine divisions. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy's third wave of new troops. The valiant fighting of the Japanese army's Fujioka, Wada, and Kaga units is a recent example and is not a matter of self-satisfaction but a clear and evident fact. During the homeland battle, both the time and location will be absolutely advantageous and worry-free for the Japanese army. Furthermore, there will be no concerns about troop strength or supplies. They will firmly defend the divine land with the great mission of protecting the country, with the construction of an inevitably victorious position for the entire population, and await the day of annihilation with Japanese soldiers and the united spirit of the people, and the anticipation of annihilating the enemy in one fell swoop is quite promising.</p>
<h3>B-29s Bomb Osaka Yesterday</h3>
<p>Osaka, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Central Military District Headquarters announced at 12:00 noon on the 15th that approximately 300 enemy B-29 bombers from Mariana bases and several smaller aircraft invaded the vicinity of Osaka at 8:40 AM on the 15th, targeting the eastern part of Osaka City, mainly, dropping incendiary bombs and explosives for about one hour and forty minutes. Fires broke out in various locations within Osaka City and in some nearby areas.</p>
<h3>Conference of Regional Governors to be Held for the First Time</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese government will convene its first conference of regional governors on the 19th to concretely discuss measures to promote the administration of the governor-general's office and the regional self-defense and self-sufficiency system. Participants in the conference will include Prime Minister Suzuki and other cabinet members from the government side, chiefs of various cabinets, and senior officials from the eight regional governors-general's offices. At the conference, the government authorities will clarify the transfer of authority from the central government, the method of communication between the central government and the regions, and the specific policies regarding the governor-general's office participation system discussed at the provisional parliament.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Discovered in the South Sea Islands</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - From 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM on the 14th, small groups of aircraft, presumably launched from British aircraft carriers of the Pacific Fleet, attacked Truk seven times. Japanese air defense units immediately engaged and repelled them.

When reporters asked if he would like to be sent to the Pacific, Patton said, "I guess we all have that wish."</p>
<h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat on Okinawa Island, Enemy Eager to Expand Air Bases</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The rainy season has begun in the Ryukyu Islands, and the weather on the 13th was still very bad. Neither Japanese nor American forces could launch air operations. The land battles on Okinawa Island continue day and night, with hand-to-hand combat. Although the enemy's forces are strong, the Japanese army's will to fight remains strong.</p>
<p>Okinawa Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy is eager to expand or build new air bases on Okinawa due to the favorable progress of the battle. There are currently ten airfields in enemy hands: the North, Central, and Ie Island airfields, as well as the South Airfield (north of Naha), the Ojima Airfield, and the other five air bases at Onna, Yonabaru, Okuuma, Aoze, and Gushikawa. Some of these have been completed, while others are actively undergoing final construction. The South Airfield and Ojima Airfield are using existing facilities, while the other five air bases are newly built. They have been hastily constructed in the past week. The enemy is transporting materials with a large number of large transport planes to the existing North Airfield and Ie Island Airfield to expand the airfield facilities. The Ie Island airfield has completed three fully paved runways of 2,000 meters. B-24 aircraft are currently very active at the North and Central airfields. In addition, many B-24 and B-17 aircraft have been transferred from Europe to the Philippines. This enemy activity deserves serious attention.</p>
<h3>Situation in Burma</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy forces in the Toungoo area are gradually reorganizing and attempting to move south. Since late May, they have launched attacks on Japanese positions northeast of Toungoo. Enemy forces, with considerable strength, have gathered at Kuntawun (30 kilometers northeast of Toungoo) in an attempt to coordinate with the enemy forces south of Taguga, a river along the Toungoo-Kyaukme road, to encircle and penetrate Japanese positions. On the 4th, Japanese units surrounding Kalaw ambushed approximately 500 enemy soldiers with tanks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, who abandoned approximately 100 bodies and halted their advance. In the areas of Loilem and Kunhing, enemy planes numbering approximately 30 have attacked Japanese positions daily since late May, providing cover with mortars and rocket launchers. However, Japanese units in the area have repeatedly engaged in close-quarters combat, forcing the enemy to retreat.</p>
<h3>China Mainland: Preparing for War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - During the recent Diet session, Army Minister Anami mentioned the mainland war situation, stating: The enemy is transferring the American-equipped Chongqing army from Burma to the Kunming and Zhijiang areas, and the enemy forces on the Pinghan Railway are also preparing for mainland operations. The military authorities are actively preparing for this. He further explained the trends on the mainland front, stating that, according to a Chongqing broadcast on June 6th, the US military command stationed in Chongqing announced that the 475th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Marine Division and the 124th Cavalry Regiment had been airlifted from Burma to the Chinese front in May. Furthermore, the newly formed 6th Army 2nd Division of the Chongqing army was airlifted from Burma to the front lines in western Hunan Province near Zhijiang in April, adopting a counter-offensive posture with the Chongqing army in that area. The enemy forces on the mainland front have been unusually active recently due to land transportation via the Stilwell Road. He Yingqin, the Chongqing Commander-in-Chief, and US General Mark Clark inspected the Hunan front in May and the Guangxi front in mid-June. During the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing government in May, resolutions were passed to strengthen the Chongqing army and promote its modernization. The various war zone commander operational meetings held by the central government all indicate their strategy to rapidly realize a general counter-offensive in the southwest. Since the Chongqing army's defeat in the Xiang-Gui campaign last year, they have begun to rebuild their military strength for the war of resistance in order to open the Stilwell Road. They have successively gathered the Chongqing army in Burma in Yunnan, and transferred Tang Enbo's army from the First War Zone to Yunnan. The vast area from Hunan through Guizhou to Yunnan is divided into four front armies—First, Second, Third, and Fourth—under the command of Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, stationing the armies of Tang Enbo, Wei Lihuang, Lu Han, and Zhang Fakui. They intend to transform approximately ten divisions of their troops into American-equipped units, actively preparing for a counter-offensive. Currently, the Chongqing army has thirty divisions of central government direct line troops stationed around Kunming. Direct line troops are also stationed in the western Xiang-Gui area, the Shaanxi area, and the Chongqing area. Gu Zhutong's army, affiliated with the central government, and miscellaneous troops with lower combat effectiveness are stationed in southeastern East China. Furthermore, the 100,000 youths recruited through the Knowledgeable Youth Enlistment Movement have been formed into ten divisions, and these troops are stationed in the Kunming, Chongqing, and Hanzhong areas. Currently, the American-equipped Chongqing army includes the newly formed 1st Army in Burma and the newly formed 6th Army, which is currently being moved. Moreover, according to a report from the Chongqing Associated Press, the Chongqing side will announce an air force expansion plan. The content has already been decided to form eleven squadrons of fighter bombers with Chinese pilots and bombardiers who have received thorough training in the United States over the past two weeks. These squadrons will be stationed at bases other than the US Air Force's 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing, in order to carry out close cooperative operations. Due to the strong power of the Japanese army and the persistent encroachment of the Yan'an army, the Chongqing side has deployed its direct line troops in the rear. However, whether they can, as the United States hopes, rise up and undertake the heavy responsibility of flanking the Japanese mainland field army with a powerful blow through active action is highly doubtful. Nevertheless, they are actively developing the Stilwell Road, training 7,000 Chinese automobile drivers, expanding the road network, and laying the China-India oil pipeline, in order to strengthen the transportation between China and India and to complete the armament of the Chongqing army with its vast military supplies. As the European war comes to an end and the attacks on Japan intensify, the mainland front is gradually becoming tense. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in mainland China is also quietly waiting for the opportune moment to strike a decisive blow against the enemy forces.</p>

<h3>Bose's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Southern Base, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, broke his long silence on the 7th and broadcast to India, the gist of which is as follows: Although the collapse of Germany is regrettable, the struggle between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will gradually deepen. The fear of Republican members of the US House of Representatives that Soviet power will permeate India is not without reason. Regardless of the outcome of this war, one thing remains certain: the ultimate goal of the Indian people is "Freedom for the Indian People." Our goal is in Delhi. Although today's international situation is difficult to predict, we must strive to advance and realize the goal of returning to Delhi in the shortest possible time. This is the consistent goal of the Provisional Government of Free India, from top to bottom.</p>

<h3>County Administration Office Convenes County and District Administrative Meeting Yesterday, Passing Many County Administration Reform Proposals</h3>
<p>The County and District Administrative Meeting convened by the County Administration Office was held yesterday (the 15th) at 9:00 AM in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. Those present included the Mayor (represented by Secretary-General Luo), Secretary-General Luo, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, County Administration Office Director Cai, Deputy Director, Security Command Chief of Staff Yu, First Section Chief Ge of the Municipal Government, Grain Section Chief Qiu of the Finance Bureau, Chief of the Accounting Section Li, Section Chief Zhang of the Municipal Police Bureau, the County Magistrates of Nanhui, Jiading, Fengxian, Chongming, Shenjiang, Baoshan, and Chuansha Counties, the District Chiefs of the Jiangwan, Huxi, Hubei, Pudong South, and Pudong North District Public Offices, representatives of the First and Second District Administrative Supervisory Commissioner's Offices, and the secretaries, section chiefs, specialists, and inspectors of the County Administration Office, totaling more than thirty people. Mr. Kumagai, the chief of the Allied Nations Liaison Department of this city, also attended with his staff.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>The meeting opened at 9:00 AM, beginning with an opening address by County Administration Office Director Cai, who reported on the significance of convening the meeting. This was followed by an address by Secretary-General Luo on behalf of Mayor Zhou, and an address by the chief of the Allied Nations Liaison Department, who expressed gratitude for the various assistance provided by the county magistrates and expressed his willingness to make every effort to resolve the difficulties of the various counties and districts at any time. Subsequently, the county magistrates and district chiefs reported on their recent administrative situations in turn. After the reports were completed, Director Cai read out the telegrams of respect to the Chairman of the National Government and the Mayor, which were unanimously approved by the entire audience. At noon, the Municipal Government hosted a luncheon for all the attendees at the meeting. At 2:00 PM, the discussion of the proposals continued. The proposals regarding civil affairs, Baojia system, finance, construction, education, and the issue of increasing the treatment of public officials and teachers were thoroughly discussed in detail and successfully passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The director and deputy director of the County Administration Office hosted a banquet for all the attendees.</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>The director of the County Administration Office said in his opening address: The counties and districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Special Municipality include the seven counties of Nanhui, Fengxian, Shenjiang, Chuansha, Jiading, Chongming, and Baoshan, and the five suburban districts of Jiangwan, Hubei, Huxi, Pudong South, and Pudong North. These counties and districts are the periphery of Shanghai Special Municipality. In terms of land area, they cover approximately 2,580 square kilometers, accounting for 90% of the entire city and about twenty times the size of the urban area. In terms of population, they have a total of more than 2.1 million people, accounting for one-third of the city and less than half the population of the urban area. From this, it can be seen that although the population of each county and district is small, the land area is very large. Therefore, the administrative work of each county and district has an ignorable position in the overall administration of Shanghai Special Municipality. Regarding the departments of administrative work in each county and district, including civil affairs, the Baojia system, police affairs, security, finance, economy, production, construction, education, society, etc., during the period when Secretary-General Luo concurrently served as director, he had already formulated and promulgated the Outline for Strengthening County Administration, ordering its implementation. Everyone should actively proceed in accordance with the regulations, in order to strengthen the implementation. In the current environment, the Mayor and Secretary-General have further instructed that the focus of county and district administrative work is to rectify discipline, ensure security, levy grain taxes in kind, and increase production. All the work stipulated in these outlines for strengthening county administration and the key points are the responsibility of the county government to implement, the responsibility of the Administrative Supervisory Commissioner's Office to supervise, and the responsibility of the County Administration Office to provide comprehensive guidance. We should all obey the instructions of the Mayor and Secretary-General, work together, and advance in step with one heart and one mind. The purpose of this County and District Administrative Meeting convened by the County Administration Office is to bring together the leaders, supervisors, and implementers of county and district administrative work, as well as the relevant heads of the Security Command and the Municipal Government, to jointly study the direction of implementation, in order to make contributions. We hope that everyone will unite and express their opinions openly and honestly.</p>
<p>Mayor's Instructions</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo delivered instructions on behalf of the Mayor, briefly stating: Regarding the implementation of county administration, the Outline for Strengthening County Administration has been formulated and promulgated for implementation. Recently, Director Cai has made an inspection tour of various counties and districts. It is hoped that county administration will be further developed in the future. The matters that should be paid attention to in handling county administration have been detailed in the Outline for Strengthening County Administration, which will not be repeated here. However, there are many difficulties in the current local administrative work. I would like to put forward a few more points as goals for our efforts: First, regarding war cooperation and security work, the faster the better, and at the same time, the less unnecessary damage to the lives of the people, the better. We must not use security work as an excuse to disturb the people. We must be responsible and do our work with our own conscience. Second, the Municipal Government employs people based on fairness. Therefore, you don't have to worry about personnel matters, so as not to disturb yourselves with unnecessary concerns. You must always perform your duties within your jurisdiction and do more inspection work. In short, do what should be done, do not listen to rumors that should not be listened to, and at the same time, do not abandon your posts. Be sure to do things that are beneficial to the people. The County Magistrate is an official responsible for defending the territory. He must strictly abide by the Ming training of being responsible for defending the territory. In addition, there is an urgent need to rectify the police. The collection of grain taxes in kind is also an important task. I hope that the County Magistrates will handle and promote it diligently in accordance with the regulations. If there are difficulties in the local area, you can submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval at any time.</p>
<h3>In the Event of a Power Outage, Measures to Supplement Water Supply are Being Actively Planned by the Construction Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau has recently made active and effective plans for the water supply and sanitation facilities for citizens, fearing that the current may be interrupted by air raids. In order to clarify the recent progress of the bureau, the reporter visited Director Xu and asked various questions, which he answered one by one. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Digging Public Wells</p>
<p>(Question) If the city encounters an air raid and the current is interrupted, making it impossible to supply tap water, what remedial measures does your bureau have? (Answer) In addition to encouraging and guiding the public to automatically dig earth wells as soon as possible in the event of an interruption of tap water, the bureau is now planning to dig twenty large public wells in areas far from rivers. The Municipal Government has approved it, and contractors can be invited to start construction in the near future. Recently, many citizens have dug earth wells, but the construction is sloppy, resulting in water quality that is often turbid and unsuitable for drinking. In order to promote and guide this, the bureau has prepared illustrations for digging wells for the public to consult and refer to.</p>
<p>Sanitation Facilities</p>
<p>(Question) If the power is interrupted, what measures will your bureau take for households in the city equipped with sanitary facilities, which cause sewage to clog due to the inability to supply tap water?</p>
<p>(Answer) This problem is also very serious. The bureau had originally planned to equip each water pumping station and Lianqing plant with its original motor, and equip it with a generator to drive the pump to pump water.</p>
<p>(Question) I wonder how much funding this plan will require?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are three sewage Lianqing plants in the city, east, west, and north, and there are about twenty or more other large and small pumping stations. If all of them are added and retrofitted with self-contained generators, the estimated cost will be more than 500 million yuan, which I am afraid the municipal treasury cannot afford.</p>
<p>(Question) How long will the retrofit take?</p>
<p>(Answer) Design and drawing will take more than a month. The installation and horsepower size of each pumping station are not uniform, and detailed calculations and designs are required. The installation project will take more than three months to complete.</p>
<p>(Question) Can this plan be realized?</p>
<p>(Answer) After retrofitting with a self-contained generator, if the power company's current is interrupted, it can work as usual, but the fuel for the generator is mainly diesel. At present, it is very difficult to purchase this type of oil, and the retrofitting project is huge and time-consuming. If the city's roads are suddenly attacked by air raids, and the sewage pumping pipes are blocked or destroyed, the pumping work will still be suspended. Therefore, this plan is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Stop Application</p>
<p>(Question) Has your bureau made any other countermeasures for this?</p>
<p>(Answer) If the pumping work is suspended, the sanitary facilities of the households must be stopped immediately to prevent sewage from overflowing. In order to prepare for the worst, we can only advise the public to prepare wooden, porcelain, or metal toilets as soon as possible for emergencies.</p>
<p>(Question) But how will the cleaning work be handled?</p>
<p>(Answer) This point is related to the work of the Health Bureau and should be connected with the Health Bureau to strive for a proper response.</p>
<h3>This City's Household Flour Is Determined to Be Rationed on Schedule, the Production of Bran Is Reduced, but the Rationing Is As Usual</h3>
<p>In order to supplement the shortage of food for the people, the Flour and Wheat Control Committee still actively maintains the original control policy for the work of unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat under this very difficult situation. Therefore, the rationing of household flour in this city is still being urged on schedule. According to news from the Shanghai District Flour and Wheat Distribution Office, the amount of flour rationed to households in this city will be reduced from two shi jin per person to one shi jin due to the difficulty of purchasing wheat and the reduced production of bran, in order to maintain the livelihood of the common people. Now that the price of rice is soaring, the demand for flour from the public is even more urgent. Although the quantity of household flour rationed cannot be increased, the original situation will be absolutely maintained in recent months and will not be delayed. We will do our best to suppress the rationing price and prevent it from increasing.</p>
<h3>Fifth Anti-Aircraft Training Holds Enrollment Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Anti-Aircraft Training Institute held by the City Anti-Aircraft Headquarters held an enrollment ceremony for the fifth class of trainees yesterday (the 15th). A total of more than two hundred trainees attended this class. Director of Education Otani reported on the number of new students and the curriculum for this class. Then, Honorary Director of Education Gu was invited to give instructions: work hard, endure hardship, contribute yourself to society, and serve society. His words were earnest. After the guests delivered their speeches, the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3>Price Evaluation Committee Negotiates to Strengthen Parity Price</h3>
<p>The prices of goods in this city have soared in the last two weeks, all because of speculative merchants manipulating and hoarding goods to stimulate people's hearts and affect social and economic stability, which is truly not a trivial matter. The City Price Evaluation Committee convened a meeting in late last month to discuss the retail price limits for major and minor commodities. It was originally scheduled to convene an evaluation meeting again in early this month to make a final decision. However, the recent drastic changes in commodity prices have been more severe. The market prices in the morning and evening are vastly different. If a price limit is set once, and the various industries cannot comply with it, the effectiveness of the implementation will not be thorough, which will hinder the promotion of administration. Therefore, the Price Evaluation Committee is currently contacting all relevant parties in order to have a sufficient supply of goods and achieve the effect of strengthening the suppression of prices.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Increases Handling Fee</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the money shop's ratio has been allowed to be increased by five cents from the date of settlement on the 16th of this month, for a total of two jiao. The industry's various shop handling fees (that is, ticket subsidies) were set at a maximum of six jiao per thousand yuan at the end of last year, but at present, prices have risen sharply and expenses have increased daily. Therefore, the application of the various association shops has also been approved, and it has been decided that from this month onwards, the various shops will change the maximum amount of the handling fee to one yuan per thousand yuan, and have been notified to the various shops to comply.</p>
<h3>Bill Discounting Becomes More Aggravated</h3>
<p>The practice of discounting bills, checks, and remittance slips in this city has recently become more aggravated, and the increase in the discount rate is especially alarming. It is reported that on the day before the Dragon Boat Festival and on the day of the festival, the bill discount rate suddenly jumped from one jiao and one jiao two fen to two jiao five fen. Although it has gradually decreased slightly yesterday, it is still in the range of one jiao three, four, and five fen. The authorities have not severely cracked down on this illegal profit, and the discounting has become an open secret. The most noteworthy thing is that most of the cash used for discounting is new cash in its original packaging. It is not difficult to immediately determine the whereabouts of the new banknotes that various banks and money shops obtain from the Central Reserve Bank of Shanghai every day. It is beyond the capacity of maintaining the bill credit system that should be guaranteed for the needs of adjusting the market by bill circulation. How can we arbitrarily collect bills for discounting profits, disrupt finance, and exploit the public? We sincerely hope that the Standing Committee will immediately crack down on this and thoroughly investigate its source, and give separate punishments to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<h3>Deputy Director Man's Report: Overview of Police Administration Implementation; Attends Press Conference to Answer Questions</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office held a press conference at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 15th) in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Man Qiwei, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, attended to answer various questions. More than ten reporters from various newspapers were present. Deputy Director Man first elaborated on the recent implementation of police administration, as follows:</p>
<p>Recent Overview of Police Administration Implementation</p>
<p>Since Director Zhou assumed office, various measures have been implemented to refresh the agency, adjust personnel, improve compensation, and rectify police discipline. A report was presented at the press conference on March 31st. The latest measures taken by the bureau are briefly outlined below:</p>
<p>Strengthening Air Defense to Minimize Damage from Enemy Raids: To strengthen air defense work and eliminate damage to citizens during air raids, the bureau is actively conducting air defense training for citizens, strengthening various air defense equipment, strictly cracking down on violations of air defense regulations, and supervising citizens to promptly build simple air raid shelters and dig anti-aircraft [Missing Information] and water [Missing Information] to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>Seriously Managing Entertainment Venues to Prevent Illegal Elements from Infiltrating: If entertainment venues are not properly managed, they can easily become breeding grounds for vice, harming public morals and security. Management regulations have been issued and enforced, strictly prohibiting overtime operation to maintain public safety and conserve electricity.</p>
<p>Intensifying Traffic Management for the Convenience of Travelers: Poor traffic order can easily lead to various disasters. To maintain traffic order, personnel have been dispatched to various jurisdictions to inspect and strictly crack down on various vehicles with faulty lights and sound control equipment. In addition, the bureau has worked with the Municipal Construction Bureau to revise the Municipal Land Traffic Management Regulations, which have been approved for implementation. A vehicle inspection team has been established by the responsible department to ensure effective enforcement, improve order, and provide convenience for travelers.</p>
<p>Strengthening Public Security with a Two-Pronged Approach: Shanghai's convenient transportation and high concentration of refugees have a profound impact on public security. To strengthen public security and address the root causes, the bureau has ordered all sub-bureaus and teams to strengthen vigilance to prevent criminal cases. At the same time, vagrants, beggars, hooligans, and repeat offenders who habitually commit crimes in the city are being detained and sent to the vagrant labor camp for rehabilitation and productive labor.</p>
<p>Seriously Investigating Narcotics to Promote National Health: The harm of narcotics is indescribable. To promote national health and engage in production, the bureau has instructed subordinates to intensify the investigation and suppression of narcotics. Recently, a number of large-scale narcotics cases have been cracked, and the individuals involved have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office and the Municipal Garrison Headquarters for legal action. Greater efforts will be made in the future to eradicate the atmosphere of narcotics and relieve the people from their suffering.</p>
<p>Expanding Crime Prevention Publicity to Reduce Criminal Incidents: Rising prices and increasingly difficult living conditions make it easier for those who do not engage in production to fall into the abyss of crime, which greatly affects public security. It is imperative to awaken citizens to jointly prevent crime and cooperate in maintaining public safety. Therefore, the bureau has established a Crime Prevention Publicity Committee, inviting prominent figures from all walks of life to serve as members, to expand crime prevention publicity and reduce the occurrence of criminal incidents.</p>
<p>Promoting Economic Administration to Stabilize People's Livelihood: In recent months, prices have soared. While the lack of material sources is a factor, hoarding by merchants is also an important reason. To promote the current economic policy, the bureau will vigorously report and crack down on those who hoard materials [Missing Information] law [Missing Information] so as to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Training Baojia Personnel to Cooperate in Maintaining City Security: In the past, Baojia personnel received appropriate training to assist military and police work, which achieved satisfactory results. Training is now being actively intensified to further cooperate in maintaining city security.</p>
<p>Improving Firefighting Work: Under the wartime system, the importance of firefighting work is self-evident. To meet urgent needs, the bureau has appropriately adjusted and strengthened key cadres of the fire department and replenished firefighting equipment to enable them to display a spirit of selflessness and fulfill their firefighting and rescue duties.</p>
<p>Standardizing Uniforms for Officers: The bureau was formed by merging the former First, Second, and Third Police Bureaus, resulting in varied uniform styles. Although repairs have been made, the uniforms remain inconsistent, which is not only unaesthetic but also affects the appearance of the police force. This year's summer police uniforms will follow the styles stipulated by the National Government and will be uniformly made and distributed by the bureau to achieve standardization and enhance the appearance.</p>
<p>Improving Police Welfare: With the recent sharp rise in prices, the salaries and allowances of officers are disproportionate. To stabilize the lives of personnel, free rice rations are being expedited, and the [Missing Information] Police Welfare Society is procuring daily necessities as much as possible, which are then sold to the bureau's officers and policemen at [Missing Information] prices, so that their current living conditions can be alleviated and their service spirit can continue to be promoted.</p>
<p>Expanding the Police Hospital: Since taking over the Police Hospital, the bureau has made every effort to recruit highly skilled medical personnel and actively replenish equipment and medicines to ensure the health of all officers. When necessary, the hospital will also undertake the work of diagnosis and treatment for citizens.</p>
<p>Rewarding Outstanding Officers and Policemen: To encourage officers and policemen to work even harder, the bureau instructed the heads of each unit last month to closely review their subordinates and list those with outstanding achievements. After verification, they were promoted this month to demonstrate encouragement.</p>
<p>Strengthening Police Education: The quality of the police force depends on the emphasis placed on education. To cultivate exemplary police officers, in addition to providing supplementary education to existing officers, the bureau is strengthening the education at the police training school, inviting outstanding instructors, and expanding educational equipment. Trainees are subjected to rigorous training, and the quality of the police force is improving daily.</p>
<p>The above are only a few of the policy outlines. There are many areas that need improvement. We hope that colleagues in the press and people from all walks of life will cooperate with the bureau so that under the leadership of Director Zhou, we can use our blood and sweat to ensure Shanghai's peace and security, enhance the welfare of citizens, and fulfill the wartime mission of the police.</p>
<p>Absolutely Eliminate Nanguo Red Flower</p>
<p>Questions Raised by Various Newspapers: To save electricity and adapt to the wartime system, the municipal authorities have restricted the business hours of various industries, especially entertainment venues, strictly prohibiting them from operating overtime. However, Nanguo and Red Flower coffee shops are still operating all night. Does the police bureau intend to crack down on them? Deputy Director Man answered: The police strictly manage the operating hours of entertainment venues, with regulations stipulating penalties for operating overtime. Some nightclubs have already voluntarily closed down. As for Nanguo and Red Flower coffee shops, which disregard the law and still operate overnight, they will be absolutely cracked down on and ordered to operate according to the prescribed hours. Violations will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Striving to Improve the Treatment of Officers and Policemen</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the treatment of officers and policemen, Deputy Director Man replied: Since Director Zhou assumed office, improvements have been made repeatedly, such as providing free rice rations, and efforts are being made to [Missing Information]. A request has also been submitted to increase salaries and allowances in order to stabilize the lives of officers and policemen.</p>

<h3>Home Tutor Training Class Scheduled to Begin Training</h3>
<p>The newspaper's Voluntary Education Committee previously resolved to establish a "Home Tutor Training Class" to provide general family children with summer tutoring needs. It has now been decided that training will be held for one week from the 20th to the 27th of this month at the Qunhua Primary School on West Changxing Road (near [Missing Information] Huali Road). Educational experts will be invited to conduct training and lectures. Qualified primary school teachers, both employed and unemployed, can register for training. Registration will be held at 2:00 PM on the 17th at the Basic Education Lecture Hall on the 4th floor of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association on Xizang Road.</p>
<h3>Donation for the Yuyao Road Fire Completely Allocated</h3>
<p>The remaining balance of 2,270,090 yuan, which this office collected for the Yuyao Road fire relief donation and deposited in the Fuxing Bank, was previously sent to the Temporary Relief Association for collection to bring it to a conclusion, the quiet details of which has been noted in a previous report. When the Association held a warrant and sent someone to collect, this newspaper issued a check from the Fuxing Bank, which was given to them to take back, fully allocating all remaining funds.</p>
<p>Encouraging Broadcast Donations</p>
<p>Since the Buddhist Benevolent Society assisted the Temporary Relief Association in constructing the Yuyao Road Civilian Village, it has been doing its best to encourage donations and start construction. Unexpectedly, the prices of labor and materials have recently soared dramatically, increasing to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per room, so the total amount is very different. In addition to appealing to all walks of life, the Buddhist Benevolent Society has received sponsorship from Lan Ting, Lin Kanghou, Li Zanhou, and Yuan Lidun, and has invited all the famous Shanghai opera singers of the Daguan Yaji to hold a Peking opera broadcast on Huangpu Radio on the 20th of this month (Wednesday) from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Yong'an's Birthday Feast Savings Donated to Charity</h3>

<h3>Basic Education Lecture Series Conducts a "Charity School Bookmark Campaign": Report</h3>
<p>In April of this year, the newspaper organized a volunteer education committee to establish ten volunteer primary schools. The enrollment of students was completed in a few days. At that time, in addition to slightly expanding the enrollment of each school, we were unable to increase the number of classes due to financial and material constraints. Recognizing that education is a century-long plan that is crucial to the future of the nation, the colleagues of the Basic Education Lecture Series, under the premise of "rescuing out-of-school children," initiated and promoted the "Charity School Bookmark Campaign" with a target of 2,000,000 yuan. The method was to donate 50 yuan for volunteer school funding and give away a beautiful bookmark as a souvenir. At that time, we wished to not only raise the aforementioned target amount of volunteer school funding, but also to awaken the interest and attention of society to volunteer education. We believe that education is part of the entire social undertaking. Only when all sectors of society work together can it be successful. Since the start of the bookmark promotion, we have received enthusiastic support from members of the community, leaders in the education sector, and students from various schools. A total of 70,331 bookmarks have been sold, with a donation of 50 yuan for each bookmark, resulting in an actual collection of 3,516,550 yuan in national currency. After deducting 304,800 yuan for printing paper, 165,375 yuan for ribbons, and 6,910 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, there remains 3,039,465 yuan (which has been handed over to the newspaper's Volunteer Education Committee for safekeeping), exceeding the target. With satisfactory results, the colleagues are very happy.</p>
<p>It is particularly worth mentioning that the staff involved in this charity school bookmark campaign were all current primary school teachers and volunteer primary school teachers from this newspaper. They used their free time to promote the bookmarks, collect donations, count quantities, and settle accounts, traveling east and west without complaint. In addition, the principals and teachers of various schools either supported the promotion or generously provided guidance, enabling this campaign to achieve [Missing Information] satisfactory results. We would like to express our highest respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>The bookmark campaign has now been completely [Missing Information] [Missing Information]. Below is a list of [Missing Information] [Missing Information] donors. It is hoped that it will be made public [Missing Information] fortune.</p>

<h3>A First-Hand Account of Inspecting the Kyushu Front Line</h3>
<p>Through the kind permission of the local army ground forces, I (a reporter from the current city newspaper's reporting team) was able to inspect the first line of defense in Kyushu, responsible for defending the homeland. My first observation from this trip was the determination and confidence of the front-line troops to annihilate the enemy, which can be represented by the words of Commander Hua (translator's note: "Hua" refers to the commander). He said, "The battle to intercept the enemy in Kyushu is fundamentally different from Saipan and other locations. If the enemy attempts to invade the Kyushu mainland, they will face annihilation at sea! Moreover, even if they manage to break through the naval defenses, they will be annihilated at the water's edge. Should they be fortunate enough to land, they will be completely wiped out, leaving not a single piece of armor intact." Commander Hua's words are based on the tried-and-true fighting spirit of the soldiers and the impregnable defense works. Standing on a corner of the Kyushu fortress's front line, facing the vast ocean, and looking around, I was deeply moved and further strengthened my conviction of certain victory. Within the permitted scope, I will report the inspection process as follows.</p>
<p>Diligent Construction of Cave Fortifications</p>
<p>The first thing the troops undertook was the construction of underground fortresses. Through hard work and sweat, they painstakingly built cave fortifications and trenches that could withstand any naval gun bombardment or aerial bombing. Whenever the soldiers had free time, they diligently dug caves, dedicating their spare time outside of training to the maintenance of the fortifications. If someone was seen standing idly, they would hear the order: "Hey, go dig!" The soldiers were fighting against mud and sand even before engaging the enemy.</p>
<p>Construction work has been mostly completed, and daily life has moved into the caves. Now, under a grand plan, the construction of defenses continues to advance. Isn't this reminiscent of the importance placed on the Rabaul stronghold? The effort put into building cave fortifications is significant. Under the unit's motto of "thorough battlefield life," the soldiers dig day and night. One soldier, in order to fulfill his responsibility, dug for ten days without rest, eventually becoming ill. However, he refused to give up, evading the nurses' eyes and secretly sneaking into the cave, where he continued to swing his pickaxe. Other soldiers came up with new methods for transporting sand and soil, increasing efficiency threefold. In such a tense environment, the prospect of bathing or living a leisurely life is simply nonexistent.</p>
<p>"I haven't taken a bath in ten days! But I don't even want to," said one soldier.</p>
<p>Mountain Life and Forgetting the Days</p>
<p>"What day is it today? Living a mountain-like existence, I've even forgotten the days," one soldier grabbed me and scratched his head, asking.</p>
<p>Although this is the homeland, in the lives of these brave warriors, it is not the homeland but a future battlefield.</p>
<p>Local residents in the vicinity do not stand idly by while the soldiers work hard. They formed a labor service team, with students using surveying instruments to take measurements.</p>
<p>"Students are not happy when there is little 'work'!" the training officer laughed.</p>
<p>The forces confined to the fortifications will fully exert their power, while utilizing everything on the ground, adding various unique designs to create strong defensive works. The fortifications are not only for defending against attacks, but also act as offensive positions to fully exert the forces and fiercely attack the enemy, making the most of the art of war. "Defense must also include the sharp spirit of attack, ensuring a proactive stance." This aspect of battlefield jargon is being realized here. Moreover, close combat attacks and daring charges are the special skills of this unit. When the time comes, all officers and soldiers, led by the commander, will engage in hand-to-hand combat to fulfill the great mission of defending the homeland.</p>
<p>Ready to Fight and Step Forward to Face Difficulties</p>
<p>The training of the front-line troops is more intense than imagined, and as heroic as actual combat. These brave soldiers, eager and ready, are full of heroic spirit. From the position with the motto "Step Forward to Face Difficulties," pointing to the crucial road leading to a certain place, Commander Guo sternly said:</p>
<p>"The battle will come from here. But no matter what, this road will not be allowed to be crossed by enemy soldiers!"</p>
<p>Ah, what a strong fortress, what a commendable determination!</p>
<p>On the one hand, although construction work is very busy, they still manage to procure food locally, cultivating sweet potatoes and vegetables in the vast fields, which is currently underway. In addition, they are also gathering medicinal herbs such as mugwort for stopping bleeding and Coptis chinensis for treating abdominal pain.

<h3>Completing the Mission with Death</h3>
<p>Saying goodbye to the green and lush base, the special attack force soared into the battlefield. The feelings of its members were indeed worthy of praise and tears, but the feelings of the fighter pilots responsible for protecting them were also tragic. Ensign Tominaga (a graduate of Meiji University, residing in Arai, Tokyo) was responsible for covering the initial special attack force in the Okinawa operation, and this was his first time in combat. Recently, he told me that he had another mission three days later, and he gave me an article at the same time. That night, he left this place and flew to the forward base. The following is his article. – Written by Special Correspondent Onuma</p>
<p>My Mission and My Comrades' are Separate</p>
<p>We consider it supremely magnificent to complete the mission with death. For example, Ensign Katsuhou's plane, which I was covering, magnificently completed his mission with death. However, I cannot die in the mission of covering my comrades. I must find out the results of my comrades' battle, otherwise it would be my shame.</p>
<p>I received the order on April ×. The number of aircraft in the special attack force and the covering force were the same. According to reports, the enemy mobile forces were escorting a large convoy to the main island of Okinawa. The attack target of the special attack force was several transport ships. Due to various reasons, the special attack force and the covering force took off from separate bases. The commander of the special attack force was the admirable Lieutenant Shirai.</p>
<p>The green earth and verdant mountains were all in darkness. Only the signal lights of the base could be seen flickering. I was ordered to cover the special attack plane piloted by Ensign Katsuhou. If I had known this earlier, I would have asked him for his last words. However, even though I could not hear them, I am sure he had already told his mother before leaving his homeland. When I received the order, I was very happy and prepared to die with the enemy ships. I have nothing to say, I only felt the nobility of completing the mission with death. The night before, when I was drinking and receiving Ensign Katsuhou's belongings, I was being watched by the reporter, which made me a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>Flying Across the Sea to the Battlefield</p>
<p>Looking at the formation, one covering plane was missing, but all the special attack planes had taken off. The night had not yet dawned. Flying straight to the battlefield across the dark sea. The destination was the airspace above the enemy US ships around the Kerama Islands. We did not have to search for the location of the enemy ships, because it was night, the enemy interceptors would not fly up, and if the enemy fired anti-aircraft fire, then their position would be revealed. However, it is important to clearly distinguish between ships and islands, because it would be a disaster to head toward an uninhabited island. However, as long as we are careful, there is no problem with this. We reached our destination, and soon it began to dawn. The convoy at sea could be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Because the light was not strong, I could not clearly see the seat of Ensign Katsuhou's plane, I could only see the outline of the aircraft. He avoided several shells, and at a height of 〇〇 meters, he found an excellent target. He shook his wings and dived down.</p>
<p>"Please, please." At this time, there was a very severe impact, which turned out to be an enemy shell exploding. Ensign Katsuhou's plane corrected the nose angle and immediately crashed down. Looking at the sea under the light of the flares, there was indeed an aircraft carrier. However, Ensign Katsuhou told me that "I am crashing into a large transport ship", and did not target that aircraft carrier. This is because it is meaningless to attack the same target as another special attack plane. And our mission is to fully destroy the enemy's landing force's supplies, so he aimed at an enemy convoy.</p>
<p>Dying in the Mission, Living in the Mission</p>
<p>Dying in the mission is actually living in the mission. It is a painful thing to depart on a covering mission, witness the enemy ship in front of you and not be able to sink it, and have to return against your will. I am waiting for the day to perish with the enemy ships.</p>
<p>One of the comrades who took off was self-detonated, that was the plane piloted by Mr. Katsuragi. According to the ground personnel, when he took off, one of the auxiliary tanks on his plane fell off. Although they sent a telegram asking him to come back, he refused to fly back, because he believed that it would be dishonorable not to participate, so he did not plan to return alive. At that moment, he had already decided to fight the enemy ships to the death.</p>
<p>When I saw my comrade break in, I also decided to follow him down. However, my mission is not to attack, but to cover my comrades. Therefore, I had to endure. (Translated from Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>Map of Okinawa and Surrounding Areas</h3>
<p>In the recent battles on Okinawa Island, the most intense fighting has taken place in the areas around Naha and Shuri in the south, as well as in 小　, 事武　, 世名城, and 一幣. In the Chinen, Tamagusuku, Tomigusuku, and Minatogawa areas of the Shimajiri district on the east coast, the two armies remain in confrontation. In order to conceal the difficulties of the battle situation, the enemy has deployed naval air forces to participate in the operation, indiscriminately carrying out bombings against the Japanese mainland and Taiwan. However, the Japanese air defense formation is as solid as a rock, and with the cooperation of the front and rear lines, the enemy mobile forces are unable to be active. Therefore, the Japanese army's grasp of future victory is even more firm.</p>

<h3>How to Dig a Well</h3>
<p>— Zheng Dingbang</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai's suffering from air raids has become an unavoidable reality, so it is imperative that citizens dig wells. This is because during air raids, various public services, such as electricity, gas, and water, are at risk of being interrupted at any time. As for electricity and water, after the electricity restrictions, there are still substitutes for electric lights, such as oil lamps, candles, and carbide lamps, which can be used as supplements. Therefore, once the power is cut off, the impact on the daily lives of citizens seems to be small, at most just inconvenient; but if the water supply is cut off, then we will undoubtedly immediately feel a serious threat and unimaginable consequences.</p>
<p>The drinking, washing, and fire-fighting water of Shanghai citizens has always relied on tap water, unlike the inland areas which generally have clean, fresh-tasting rivers, pools, and wells that can be used. Therefore, we must quickly dig wells to prevent any emergencies. At the same time, the current water consumption has also been reduced due to electricity savings, which has caused inconvenience in daily use. As summer approaches, water consumption will inevitably increase, so wells should be dug in time to remedy the shortage of tap water.</p>
<p>Many wells have indeed been dug everywhere now, but the water quality is difficult to satisfy people, because some people are greedy for cheapness and there is no one to guide and supervise them, allowing well-digging merchants to dig randomly. Some people hire well-digging merchants who have not registered with the Construction Bureau to work, resulting in poor results. This wastes manpower and resources, and does not benefit the actual situation at all.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned man-made reasons, geological factors are also related to the suitability of wells. This is because in Shanghai, about two meters below the ground, there are often things like mud, garbage, coal, and other things, and occasionally there are sewers and sewage pipes. If wells are dug in this kind of place and ordinary bricks and tiles are used to construct the well, then the water source will not be clean. It cannot be used for drinking or washing. Some water sources may not be turbid on the surface, but because they are dug too shallow and have limited water storage, the water will be stirred into a muddy slurry as soon as it is drawn, making it unusable. So we must pay attention to the following points to ensure that the wells we dig are suitable for drinking, washing, and fire-fighting:</p>
<p>The well site should be as far away as possible from toilets, ditches, or other dirty places, at least three meters away. If you encounter mud, garbage, or sewage pipes when digging, it is best to relocate and dig again, otherwise find another remedy.</p>
<p>The well should not be too shallow, and the depth should be at least five meters or more. If you encounter quicksand after digging to a considerable depth, it is best to relocate and dig again.</p>
<p>The inner wall of the well, at least the upper half, about two meters, must be constructed with impermeable materials to prevent sewage from flowing in.</p>
<p>After the well is completed, alum should be placed in the water to allow impurities in the water to settle to the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>If you need to sterilize, the easiest way is to add one part per million of bleaching powder to the water (the newer the bleaching powder, the better. There are many ways to disinfect, but some methods are not easy to do under normal circumstances).</p>
<p>You must hire a well-digging merchant who has registered with the Construction Bureau to carry out the work.</p>
<p>Now, to be more specific, here are the drawings and explanations of several types of wells:</p>
<p>(A) When digging a well, if you get a layer of yellow mud immediately after digging, and there are no ditches or sewage pipes passing through, then the water source of this well will probably be clean and suitable. In this case, the surroundings of the well may be built purely with concrete blocks or tiles to save costs.</p>
<p>(B) If it is a layer of mud or garbage immediately after digging the ground, or there is a sewage pipe passing nearby, it is best to relocate and dig again. If the location is limited, then the upper section of the well, about two meters, must be constructed with waterproof materials to prevent sewage from flowing in. The waterproof part must extend below the water surface. The waterproof part is best to use reinforced concrete and three-part soil tile pipes, but due to the current shortage of materials and high prices, one part cement, two parts yellow sand and grout can be used to build the wall, and the surface can be plastered with cement and yellow sand. The lower section can still be built with tiles or bricks.</p>
<p>(C) If the four walls of the well can be built entirely with waterproof materials from top to bottom, and the bottom of the well is not made of wood, but is replaced with a sand filter layer (the bottom layer is gravel, followed by fine gravel, coarse sand, and the top layer is alum or a mixture of alum and lime), such a well, no sewage will flow in from the surroundings, and the water source will only come from the yellow mud layer at the bottom of the well through the sand filter layer, then the water here will definitely be very clean and suitable.</p>
<h3>Municipal Advisory Council Suggests Relaxing Water Rationing</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Council of this city recently had a proposal on the issue of water rationing in this city, which has been sent to the Municipal Government for handling. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the water supply has been reduced by 30%. Now that summer is here, the weather is getting hotter and people naturally need more water. Water is indispensable for human life. Since the drastic price increase and rationing of tap water, citizens have had no choice but to reduce washing and conserve water, and switch to drawing water from the river or using well water. Reducing washing can hinder hygiene, and river water and well water have not been scientifically disinfected, and are likely to cause disease when drunk. At a time when rice prices are soaring, citizens are already malnourished and their resistance is very weak. How can they withstand the attack of germs in unsafe drinking water? Few will be able to avoid illness and death. Therefore, it is specially recommended that your government quickly transfer this to the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company and the French Water and Electricity Company, and order the Construction Bureau to immediately correct the situation and maintain the original summer water supply to meet the needs of citizens.</p>
<h3>Law and Life</h3>
<p>— A Police Officer</p>
<p>A few months ago, two police officers who perverted justice were executed at the racecourse. The people of the city applauded and cheered when they heard the news. The authorities' decisive handling of this case, which demonstrated the strictness of the law, can indeed serve as a warning to others and achieve the effect of rectifying officialdom and eliminating corruption.</p>
<p>I, the writer of this article, am also a member of the police force. I feel immense relief at the elimination of these bad elements, but also feel boundless shame.</p>
<p>Since Zhou Jian took office as the director, he has focused on improving the living conditions of police personnel, using the minimum amount needed to maintain the family expenses of each officer as the standard. As a result, salaries were increased by two and a half to three and a half times, and two and a half to six *dou* of rice were distributed free of charge, as well as running welfare societies to distribute affordable daily necessities. This enabled every police officer to settle down and further commit to their duties. At the time, this treatment could indeed be called quite generous, and the police administration gradually moved onto the right track. Generally, police officers who used to be corrupt and pervert justice could restrain themselves a little.</p>
<p>However, now, prices are rising in a straight line, while the treatment of police officers is still the same. Compared to the prices at that time, the difference is several times higher. Therefore, the salary that was able to maintain life in the past cannot cope today. This is indeed a problem worth studying. If the livelihood of police officers cannot be maintained, they naturally cannot be loyal to their duties. Some may even disregard the law because of lack of funds, using their official positions to extort money illegally. In this way, not only can security not be maintained, but on the contrary, security will be thrown into chaos. Therefore, I hope the authorities can find a remedy for us as soon as possible, so that we can work with peace of mind and not violate the law of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Air Raid Shelters - Part 1: Construction Must Be Solid</h3>
<p>Every night on the way home, the high and low piles of mud kept slipping under my feet, that is the air raid shelter dug by the Baojia authorities.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, when passing Jiading Road, I saw a large crack in an air raid shelter next to the road, and it was bent. I deeply felt that the moment of the air raid shelter's support (Mcmenl) could not bear all the external force. Not to mention an air raid, even in peacetime without any external force (excluding the natural external forces such as air pressure and wind force), it would collapse in the short term.</p>
<p>The construction of air raid shelters is currently underway. Except for the main ones completed by the government, most have not yet been completed. Recently, each household was asked to donate a certain amount to the police defense donation by the Baojia to complete the unfinished air raid shelters. Before the construction is completed, I would like to make the following suggestions as a reference for the Baojia.</p>
<p>Within the possible scope, use wood as the principle for the supports in the air raid shelter. Use substitutes when necessary, but pay attention to their moment (Momenl).</p>
<p>Do not allow cracks or holes in the soil covering the air raid shelter.</p>
<p>After the air raid shelter is completed, it should be responsible for by the self-defense corps, and do not allow mischievous children to destroy it.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the cleanliness inside and outside the air raid shelter. (Ran Cui)</p>
<p>Part 2: Volume Should Not Be Too Small</p>
<p>The construction of air raid shelters in Shanghai is scattered everywhere to meet the needs of air defense. Now, "small air raid shelters" are being built in various neighborhoods, like the Jiu'an neighborhood, each house has to contribute 2,150 yuan, and the total amount collected is quite considerable! However, the "small air raid shelters" that I have seen are not much bigger than the Ziliu Well, like the tombs of children in the countryside, they are too small! If an emergency air strike occurs, how can everyone squeeze into the small air raid shelter?</p>
<p>I hope that those in charge of the matter should widen the length, and the depth should also be deepened. As for the width, since most alleys are narrow, widening the alley will hinder traffic. The width of a Eight Immortals table seems still appropriate. Secondly, before the small air raid shelter is completed, the pit has been dug, which is very dangerous! There are many children playing in the lane, and they are likely to fall into the trench and suffer serious injuries or death! I hope to cover the pit with wooden boards or straw mats, and draw red powder lines around the outside. It would be even better if a red sign with the words "Beware of Danger" could be placed there! (Luohan)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Charging Fees at the Municipal Library</h3>
<p>— Fenggang</p>
<p>It was reported that the Municipal Public Library of this city has a move to charge a small loan fee. I am also a member of the Municipal Public Library. The library's collection of loan fees this time is in the nature of extortion. The receipt has words like "Thank you for your generous donation of one hundred yuan." The colleagues in the library are trying to supplement their income because they are having financial difficulties. Their intention is understandable, but their method is very bad.</p>
<p>For the present plan, the library should immediately cancel the "loan fee" method and find other legitimate ways to increase income and reduce expenditure, which would be great for poor members.</p>
<p>As for the ways to increase income and reduce expenditure, as far as I can see, there are the following two points:</p>
<p>Submit a request to the municipal government for additional funding. The library is a cultural undertaking, and it is of great importance to social education. Now that the municipal government is trying to improve the lives of primary school teachers and journalists, it should also consider the living problems of the librarians and adjust their treatment appropriately.</p>
<p>Cut redundant staff. There are many librarians in the library, but their work efficiency is very low. When handling borrowing and returning procedures, they often chat and laugh with each other, treating the members waiting in line as if they were invisible. If those who are not working effectively can be cut off, and their salaries can be given to those who are working hard, then efficiency can be improved and the lives of the librarians can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Request to Authorities to Open the Municipal Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>— Yiren</p>
<p>Recently, due to the soaring cost of living, apart from a few speculators who frequent entertainment venues for extravagant revelry, the majority of citizens feel the pain of having too few wholesome recreational opportunities. This leads us to recall the convenience and benefit that the municipal swimming pool (located at the end of North Sichuan Road) brought to the citizens when it was open last year.</p>
<p>We remember the emerald green water, the white-tiled pool edge, and the quiet surroundings. For one hundred yuan (which would of course be adjusted this year), one could swim, bathe, and rest the body and mind. This kind of joy is beyond the reach of those who immerse themselves in the world of wine, women, and song; rather, it is a wholesome form of recreation that citizens should enjoy and can enjoy during this wartime.</p>
<p>We hear that the municipal government is not preparing to open the swimming pool this year. We do not yet know the reason. We suggest that unless the swimming pool is being used for other purposes, it should be open to the public. Although this is a small matter, it is closely related to the people's love for the municipal government and the connection between the municipality and its citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the rumor that the swimming pool will not be open this year is untrue.</p>
<h3>My Views on Establishing Free Middle Schools</h3>
<p>— Tang Yuan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yao's article "Establishing Free Secondary and Higher Schools" in the fourteenth issue of this publication, I strongly agree with his sentiments. Today, there are countless ambitious young people who are turned away from school doors. Compulsory education is inherently the responsibility of the government and the Ministry of Education itself, and it should not be considered a form of relief. However, today's free schools are mostly founded by enthusiastic individuals and have nothing to do with the government, which is why they ultimately do not achieve significant results.</p>
<p>Regarding free middle schools, as far as I know, the Student Fellowship of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund began preparing for their establishment two months ago. The person in charge was running around all day, but now I hear that it has been temporarily shelved. The biggest reason is the lack of a suitable school site. Because of this, the entire plan has come to a standstill, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>The government fails to encourage, support, or guide existing free schools, and it fails to assist those who aspire to start them. This is why Chinese education is on the verge of bankruptcy and cannot be revitalized.</p>
<p>Without mincing words, establishing free secondary and higher schools is an urgent task that cannot be delayed any longer. In addition to earnestly hoping that the government and all sectors of society will actively promote it, I humbly offer a few points for the reference of enthusiastic individuals:</p>
<p>Within existing universities, the school authorities should establish free education classes, utilizing spare time, with education students serving as teachers, which would also provide them with practical experience. The cost would be minimal.</p>
<p>Within each baojia district, the baojia authorities should conduct surveys in the schools within their districts. If schools have spare time, they should establish free middle schools to provide a place for out-of-school youths in the district to continue their education. The expenses could be supported by the baojia committee or by soliciting donations from residents in the district. Since it concerns public welfare, there will surely be many donors.</p>
<p>Each trade association should set aside a special item in its budget to establish free middle schools to provide relief to the children of its members.</p>
<p>The municipal education authorities should establish free middle schools in the municipal schools.</p>
<p>Compulsory education should be founded by the government. However, in this day and age, with the separation of officials and the people, and with all sectors of society striving for their own welfare, there are many enthusiastic people. This great cause of saving people and the country should not end up as a flash in the pan or be abandoned halfway.</p>
<p>As for the curriculum content of free middle schools, it should focus on matters related to practical life. Topics that are empty or divorced from life can be temporarily omitted. The key is to enable out-of-school youths to learn what they need in the most valuable time, apply what they learn, and thus improve both their studies and their careers, indirectly promoting society forward. This is the true purpose of free middle schools.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to loudly appeal to people from all walks of life to work together to promote this cause, guide working youth onto the right track, help out-of-school youth to continue to improve, and universally establish free middle schools, as well as various specialized schools above the secondary level, so that every young person has the opportunity to study. Then, the future of education, the future of society, and the future of the nation will be filled with great hope.</p>
<p>(The editor notes: If the schools in our city are willing to generously lend or rent their school buildings to free middle schools, please write to the Shen Bao Free Education Committee. We are eagerly awaiting your response!)</p>

<h3>People of a Small Town</h3>
<p>— Xia Ru</p>
<p>Last year, I lived in an old small town. In the late spring when fallen petals were fluttering, I went there, and just as I touched the familiar feet of spring again, I returned.</p>
<p>I cannot forget the people of the small town, living in an overly leisurely way of life, always obedient under the instructions of their grandmothers, but they were kind. Although there were too many temples and pagodas, cold and solemn like ancient patterns on broken porcelain vases, but standing in the sweet potato fields, listening to the sound of the dove bells passing by, people were like silhouettes pasted on a green oil painting, the dizzy high sky extending to a deeper distance.</p>
<p>I cannot forget the girl who grew up in lonely happiness. Every day, she came to fetch my ice bucket and filled a wooden bucket with clear water for me. Her eyes were very round, and when she smiled, it seemed that there was a teardrop rolling in the corner of her eye. The neighbor told me that she was already a fifteen-year-old girl, but she was as short as a flattened pumpkin. Standing on the earthen slope, I reached out and picked two dark purple mulberries from the crumbling wall of her house. Her eyes widened even more: "Give them back, give them back –" stubbornly holding my hand, the freckles on her nose were clearer under the evening tide. "The little girl was born in a jar, grew up in a jar, no father, no mother, the big girl is like a short-legged toad, ha, no husband's family, hey, do you want to get married?" Imitating the neighbors' teasing words, the immature girl suddenly became shy, lowered her head, and I felt a cruel smile that humiliated others, echoing. She ran away, then stopped; pouted her mouth, and threw the two mulberries she had carried back hard at my face, then laughed wildly, making faces, and jumping happily like a rabbit.</p>
<p>The old man was a silent grandfather, with intimidating eyes, but in the morning, he was braiding the little girl's hair outside the wood shed, his hands trembling under the tattered blue cloth short coat. How could he be strong again, having raised his son, and now having to take care of his son's daughter, and when he saw his granddaughter's sturdy, slightly protruding chest, there was a taste of illusory sadness. Was an old man's emotions like still water? No, when I left the house in front of the ancient temple, people were all saying:</p>
<p>A woman in her thirties or forties often appeared here at night, dark and sturdy, a beggar woman. Yesterday, when the stars were twinkling, they saw that woman like a ghost pushing into the old man's wood shed. As soon as it was light, the country people carrying manure also said that a woman walked from this path to the streets. Well, nothing else, it was hard for that little girl. I was not surprised by the primitive love of a man in his fifties, and I sadly saw the unnecessary girl in this story! Was it?</p>
<p>Now, I am deeply thinking about the young only son in the backyard.</p>
<p>Standing under the mica window rinsing my mouth, I first caught sight of his rat-like, timid eyes. With a mouthful of water, I mumbled: "Good morning!" But there was no polite reply. In the evening, going to the stove to get hot water, I saw him leaning against the door frame of the courtyard, his eyes full of the ardent desire of a woman on the eve of her marriage. He was very tall, but his arms hung down weakly. – Don't criticize someone weaker than you – he wanted to avoid me again, putting on a friendly smile, I restrained him, gently, afraid of startling the landlord's old lady's only son. That was a pious old woman who only had her Buddha and her son.</p>
<p>"Are you watching the moon climb up that old locust tree? Or are you waiting for the first star to appear in the sky?" Every night I heard him reading and reciting poems in a low voice, which was a more desolate sob than the sound of the night watchman's clapper in the deep night, the sound of youth being suppressed.</p>
<p>"No, I'm standing waiting for the lights to come on, then I'll go back to the house and sleep." Hearing his mother's slow footsteps, he stammered, the kind of joy a newly weaned child has when it sees its mother's breast again, revealed on his face, in his younger eyes. Without saying good night, he disappeared into the darkness behind the threshold, and I walked up the stone steps following that gray-haired woman, and their uneven shadows on the flagstone ground.</p>
<p>"A young man who will forever follow his mother to the gray grave!" I couldn't help but sigh lightly for his often taciturn and lonely expression.</p>
<p>I was really afraid to hear the plucking of the steel stringed zither, he loved to play "Autumn River Night Moon," sadly shaking like a widow's complaints on a misty night without stars or moon. But, who knew that under the lighted window was a life in its twenties! It was a life that needed love and hate, but it was easily locked in this deep courtyard, pinched by the hand of his dying mother.</p>
<p>People all thought he was the luckiest young man, with a house, land, a closet full of books, gentle and mature, but in fact, he was dying before his beloved mother's death, never thinking about the outside world, he was blessed. If he once groped in a wider world, his wings would be broken. Was he?</p>
<p>I am thinking of that old man selling water caltrop with his unique cry.</p>
<p>The small town was a water town, lotus roots and water caltrop were eaten from the dog days to mid-autumn. Outsiders who eat them would never forget the sound of the old man picking water caltrop.</p>
<p>The first time, the sun was still burning like charcoal fire, I was taking a nap, and was awakened by that low, hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Shajiao water caltrop, hot and pure water caltrop, do you want to eat it, water caltrop –" It was strange why the peddlers along the street had such violent cries, fiercely. I opened the door and ran out to find him, he was walking with his head down, his face full of sweat.</p>
<p>"Forty yuan a catty, small water caltrop thirty yuan, did you hear me? My eyes are fierce and red.</p>
<p>"Let's make a long-term customer, big ones thirty yuan, old man!" I bargained.</p>
<p>"Go to hell, buy it or not you. Shajiao water caltrop, hot –" So simply, he carried the wooden bucket of water caltrop away, into the deep alleys and narrow streets.</p>
<p>One afternoon, I strolled along the fields, walking towards his broken tile house by the pond.</p>
<p>"Old man, if you didn't sell me water caltrop during the day, according to my temper, I would have broken your jaw, but I love you for being so straightforward, so I came to see your old wife, and buy a few catties of fresh pond water caltrop!" I said tactfully.</p>
<p>"Buy water caltrop then buy some, how many catties? Three catties will be fifty yuan!" He handed me the dripping wet rush bag, sat down impatiently, and smoked his dry tobacco.</p>
<p>I sat for the whole dusk, he ignored me, and didn't even look at me. It seemed he had discovered a miracle, he only spoke to himself, muttering to himself, intermittently.</p>
<p>"Hmm, let's go, what's so rare, alas, I'm going to Nantang tomorrow to buy water caltrop wholesale, it's going to rain…" His head was tilted, his eyes staring blankly, like an idiot, and covered with red threads.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that he was an old widower abandoned by his wife. One spring evening, his young wife secretly took the water caltrop boat in the pond, rowed to the bridge leading to Tongxian County, and ran away with the lover who was waiting.</p>
<p>He immersed his life in the foam of wine, in curses, in eccentric and violent monologues, he was a suffering, tormented soul. Was he?</p>
<p>People of the small town, I have an ideographic heart, but I lack a pair of relief hands. It was only a year, but there was love beyond profound time. If I go there again, and see them again, what kind of mood will arise?</p>
<h3>To</h3>
<p>— Chunyi</p>
<p>Like a swallow in spring, you flew here on an accidental day, lingered only for a moment, and then fluttered away.</p>
<p>This place was not meant for you to stop at: how can pure birds grow in a rotten nest? How can a free lark be confined in a stuffy cage? What's more hateful is the rogue's hand that wants to snatch into the nest, the greedy mouth that laughs vulgarly into the cage! I know that this is what you cannot tolerate. You came full of hope, rejoicing in your acquisition of a job, gaining the beautiful name of independence, but in the end you realized that this was only a boring, muddled place to beg for food, this was only a "self-reliance" in the form of selling yourself! What's more, you had to hear and see countless malicious, flirtatious laughter and glances cast at you! You felt embarrassed, you felt disappointed, so you had no choice but to return resentfully.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will suffer and blame yourself: who told you to have such beautiful ideals? Who told you to have such a clear mind? Who told you to have such passionate emotions? Who told you to have such beautiful features?... The flash of your sacred beam has revealed the ugliness of so many people's hearts; and often when your brilliance is lost, they come again to make an ugly confession. You came lonely, you went quietly, why did you not leave a clear trace, to shake the ugly group, and to comfort one who loves you silently outside of the wicked? The swallow flew here, only sighing that there was no place to perch, only complaining about being bullied, but you did not notice that there was one outside the ugly group who was willing to exchange enthusiasm with you? He also has a character that makes him painfully uneasy with reality, he also has a heart that cannot be stopped, he also thought about breaking away from this rotten place, and breaking free, but in order to further expose the darkness and challenge it, holding the belief that "if you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the cubs", while the problem of survival is always pressing him, so he straightened his back and endured here.</p>
<p>Of course, he has no reason to assume that you are weaker or more passive than him, because he is brave, he at least has more convenience than you in society. For example, in the moment when he and you met, the rogue hands and greedy faces of those guys would not reach him, on the contrary, he could use them as whetstones for reforming and resisting . What's more, you have a natural beauty, which, although it can create a woman's pride and conceit, often leads to great misfortune in the present circumstances; it seems to create a woman's honor and status, but in fact it is an obstacle to your development. However, if you can ignore your shadow and pity yourself, indulge in vanity, and cherish makeup, rejoicing in showing off your beauty to others, and grieving over the fact that your tenderness has no place to be, then you will have more determination to work for the facts. Perhaps, your family environment is not bad, and you have not had any difficult experiences. This peaceful stream-like, slowly flowing life has cultivated your gentle and virtuous personality. This is your advantage, but it can also be said to be your weakness. For this reason, people will think of you as a good woman who is used to obeying and does not know how to resist, and take your shy and charming attitude as a boring appreciation; for this reason, you are embarrassed by the ridicule from all sides and dare not face the ridiculers in the theater of evil. Precisely because you have not grown up in the rapids, and you have not been tempered by storms, you are too caught up in beautiful fantasies, and you have a pure and fragile heart. This naiveté is invaluable, and it has deeply aroused the sympathy of those who truly love you. He is willing to break your beautiful fantasy with his cry, he is willing to strengthen your timid heart with his strength. Although he cannot see through the villainous heroes, he is constantly searching and moving forward. Regardless of what comes after, or what the results are, but occasionally he is lonely, and the road ahead is vast. So he thought of personal love, and the relationship between personal love and group love; and so he discovered that your shadow had been deeply engraved on his heart, and he had silently fallen in love with you.</p>
<p>I remember, no, the feeling seems to be right in front of me: you lowered your head and sat at the table, hearing the colleague's hateful mockery and ridicule, and daring not, perhaps not even daring to look up at them. Looking at your lovely back, he wanted to run over to talk to you and express some honest opinions several times, but in the end he was obstructed by those thieving and monkey eyes, and he did not get the chance. Once, I heard you say that you were unwilling to be a vase for people to admire here, but that you would like to be a competent, hard-working, poor elementary school teacher. Then you lamented the difficulty of women finding jobs, and the depression that women are given at the moment. He only smiled at you with empathy, and said nothing, thinking that there would definitely be a chance to talk at length in the future, who knew that after that day, he would never see your lovely figure again!</p>
<p>Have you really gone? Have you really left with broken dreams and a drooping head? Did you not know that there were people here who were worth being friends with? Did you not know that the despicable era needs to be repelled in the cursed place? But all this cannot be blamed on you, you were originally a little bird born in a free and peaceful world, and once you are in a dark cage, you lose your courage and wisdom.</p>
<p>Like a swallow in spring, you flew back again on a sudden day. May those light and free wings carry the eternal love of the one who loves you to the vast horizon?</p>
<h3>Grass Under the Window</h3>
<p>— Duanmu Menghuan</p>
<p>In the bedroom under the north window, I set down a writing desk, and so; I can write something and see something.</p>
<p>During the day, although sunlight never shines fully on the table, the light is sufficient, and so; my will has been decided! I do not have any excessive demands of it.</p>
<p>If I feel a little tired from writing or reading, then, I put down my pen or book, look at the piece of blue sky in front of the window, and that can very well adjust my weary mind. Later it will be summer, and the slowly moving white clouds will surely be able to further "travel my eyes and wander my thoughts."</p>
<p>If, outside the window there could be such a small piece of lawn or flower bed, at the very least there should be such a few green elm trees, or willows would be good too, that would be even more ideal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my stay here will not be long, otherwise I would certainly plant a few branches, watching them gradually grow up, my young mood might be even more cheerful because of that.</p>
<p>With those verdant trees, then, it would inevitably attract some sparrows and the like, and I would not have to worry about not having birdsong to hear!</p>
<p>At night, the sparse shadows of the trees accompany the moonlight, reflected on the window curtain. Sitting quietly under the window, letting me appreciate such scenery, then, even if I am a vulgar person, I cannot help but be elegant at this time.</p>
<p>At this time, I could also pick up a flute and blow my favorite "Spring River Moonlit Night," which would be even more enjoyable. – But, the most suitable time should be late at night.</p>
<p>At the same time, I would also brew a pot of "Dongting Emerald Spring Tea," – milk coffee is not suitable for this time and place – and reluctantly force myself to invite a friend over, to talk about the things we like to talk about.</p>
<p>For such "leisurely sentiments and unrestrained tastes" some people might mock me for "not being fashionable," but, I think, why is it necessary to put on a "bitter face" all day long? Being able to steal a moment of leisure in this floating life, and symbolically let myself take a breath, I dare say that it is not an absolutely "senile" thing.</p>
<p>Lately, I have had quite a bit of "free time." Since I have such a good place for writing and reading, then, I always spend most of my free time "under the window!"</p>
<p>"Under the window," I have discovered a world that I had never discovered before, I have gained new feelings that I had never had before.</p>
<p>This is not what the "notebook" gave me.</p>
<p>I thought of "environment." Under the window, I have come to realize that the environment can indeed change a person's mood. At the same time, I am even more convinced that writing and reading do require a "good environment."</p>
<p>Although what I have is not an absolutely good environment for writing and reading, I am satisfied, because I can sit comfortably, write comfortably, and read comfortably, and there is also a period of quiet time, and a piece of blue sky to see –.</p>
<p>What else do I want?</p>
<p>There is one more thing I want, and that is to let me stay in this environment for a longer time!</p>
<h3>My Fight with T.B. Bacteria</h3>
<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>T.B. bacteria are like the northern land—</p>
<p>In September, the dust of the yellow sand sky is densely layered,</p>
<p>Spreading throughout the entire space, spreading around me. Everywhere are bacteria,</p>
<p>Everywhere are T.B. bacteria. Bacteria are like yellow sand in a great wind—</p>
<p>Penetrating the mask,</p>
<p>Sweeping past the hairs in the nostrils, they—</p>
<p>Drill—drill—drill—towards the depths of the lungs,</p>
<p>Towards the liver, towards the gallbladder, towards the kidneys, towards the large intestine… towards every vulnerable part of the human body—</p>
<p>—Attack! I live together with T.B. bacteria!</p>
<p>My office</p>
<p>Faces the chimney of the boiler room, coal smoke—carbon dioxide—carbon monoxide</p>
<p>Suffocating me and</p>
<p>Crowding out fresh air! My workshop</p>
<p>Hides in the damp corner of the basement,</p>
<p>Dampness—darkness—and sultriness, the most excellent,</p>
<p>Unparalleled culture medium for T.B. bacteria. My workers,</p>
<p>Complexions pale, skinny like firewood. Interns,</p>
<p>Always with their bodies bent over—</p>
<p>—Coughing! Returning home,</p>
<p>In the middle of the night,</p>
<p>I can hear my elderly mother's painful, low cough.</p>
<p>Her lungs have been eroded by T.B. bacteria since she was young. My younger brother</p>
<p>Suffers from pulmonary T.B. My younger sister</p>
<p>Suffers from intestinal T.B. My good friend</p>
<p>Is coughing up blood because of T.B.,</p>
<p>Unable to participate in—</p>
<p>—The imminent graduation exam! My neighbor's lovely little girl</p>
<p>Died last month from T.B. meningitis! Ah! T.B. bacteria,</p>
<p>—Everywhere, heavily</p>
<p>Tightly</p>
<p>Surrounding me, like an invading army</p>
<p>Besieging the city of justice with deadly artillery fire. Ah, no! I must be strong—strong</p>
<p>—Even stronger</p>
<p>To fight the T.B. bacteria!</p>
<p>—Like the national heroes</p>
<p>Defending their own homeland!</p>
<h3>Against the Current, and Preface</h3>
<p>— Song Xiang</p>
<p>For several years, I have consistently refrained from writing articles that I deem unworthy of my pen. If I ever did, I would have destroyed them in those past years. At that time, I felt that, apart from Napoleon in modern history, there would be no more unfortunate events where a person's inability to conquer their environment would cause the phrase "Man will conquer nature" to suffer unexpected insults or bankruptcy. However, in reality, the formation of failure often completely overturns and obliterates the so-called "Man will conquer nature" crown. Therefore, from the height of Mount Tai to the lightness of a goose feather, I believe that there is simply nothing in the world that can be transformed or overcome by relying solely on an individual's will in the face of the environment. Since ancient times, in dictionaries, in the majestic history, all fiery and encouraging words, as well as moving and inspiring speeches, once that moment has passed, are equivalent to wine that has lost its fizz. I think this is not my grumbling, nor is it my sense of disappointment. The inscrutability of life is inherently subject to the whims and control of fate. If you have strength, you can temporarily overcome it, or be eternally conquered by it. But having read through the history of China and foreign countries, ancient and modern, where has there been such a person? Writing to this point, I really can't write any further. I can only shake my head and sigh, saying: "Alas! This is why life is life."</p>
<p>On May 8, 1945, the European war finally ended with Germany's surrender. The great leader Hitler, after a period of brilliant history dedicated to saving his country from its plight and striving for its revival, followed the same unfortunate path of fighting on two fronts and reduced thirty years of effort to being ruined in a single day and escaping. Not only did he fail to tear up the Treaty of Versailles to create a revived and powerful Germany, but even the twenty-seven years of misery were destined to be deepened by today's fate. Although we don't necessarily judge heroes by success or failure, this kind of reality, without even comparing it to Napoleon in history, is enough to chill us—all efforts are in vain. Why bother talking about struggle in the world? It's better to muddle through and entrust everything to nature! While lamenting such things in the world, I began my own negativity and wrote articles that I wouldn't normally write. This is today's "Against the Current" (The above is the preface).</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>People who used to openly and secretly slander others have now become 100% realistic worshipers of power and influence. I admire their ability to seize reality and adapt to the environment, just as my own inability to ingratiate myself has become the opposite extreme. In the past, in any position, I never uttered a single word of slander, nor did I harbor such thoughts in my heart. Even now, I still don't regard those who are worshiped by the power-hungry as outstanding figures of an era. But because of this, I have obliterated reality, to the point that others are full, while I am hungry and cold. Finally, there are these two completely different distinctions. I have received a lesson from reality and deeply understood the true meaning of life. There is no need to regret the past, nor is there a need to yearn for the future. As long as you grasp and utilize reality, you won't have to worry about overestimating the value of life, and there will be a meaning to being human!</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>The "Historical Records" records Su Qin's self-description of returning home in glory: "If I had two hundred acres of good land, and my father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law were all on good terms, how could I wear the seals of office of six states!" If this kind of talk wasn't a feeling that Su Qin expressed after wearing the seals of office of six states, I can assert that Sima Qian wouldn't have bothered to write it so faithfully to vent his anger. However, the father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law of Su Qin, who took advantage of reality, not only knelt to welcome him thirty miles outside the city but also unanimously stated afterward that the reason why they had previously looked down on this Prime Minister of Six States was simply that they hoped he would have "such a day"! Do you say that this is unreasonable? Wouldn't that obliterate the motives of the so-called "benevolent people" of the past and present? But no matter how they say it, Su Qin knows it in his heart. As long as he doesn't "misunderstand," how can I not envy him for having Su Qin's father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law!</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>My neighbor is a couple who are not only uneducated but also childish in their minds. The man actually earns two or three hundred thousand a month, but according to the woman, "Our expenses are not small, at least seven hundred thousand yuan." They have six children, so it doesn't seem like she's bragging. The man "respects women's rights" to the utmost, so he regards his wife's orders as sacred edicts. And this woman! She is simply a "Zhao Zilong with boundless courage" heroine. All day long, she's either playing mahjong, losing eighteen thousand at a time, or gossiping about the neighbors, showing her "heaven-sent" eloquence. She is good at scolding and arguing, and even after provoking others, she calls the neighborhood committee to mediate and determine who is right and who is wrong, the neighborhood committee member immediately says: "My father is an official in Nanjing, you can't help others speak, you must be sensible," and so on. Therefore! She often proclaims herself the "victor who is glorious first"! However, although we are close neighbors, my wife feels all sorts of mental pressure because of her, because she is extremely "considerate" of my wife, and when she meets her, she asks about our embarrassing situation, and so on, using it as conversation material in "peaceful times," and then she works "diligently" day and night to incite my wife to divorce me, so my wife tells me: "If you continue to be so poor, she will call the police to find me to divorce you."</p>

<h3>Volleyball League Women's Group, Three Provinces Completes Hegemony with All Wins</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>The strength and situation of the two women's groups in the volleyball league have already been described before. So far, the women's group of Three Provinces has completed their hegemony. Four wins in four matches to win this year's championship, fulfilling the dreams of those heroines, it is also a good thing. In Group A, the Northern team has five wins in five matches. There is still one match against the home team, and the top spot can be unshakable, so it is possible to maintain the honor of always winning. In Group B, Division Two, there are many participants, and also unfortunately, several times the weather was delayed due to rain, so there is still little evidence at the moment. It is estimated that the most powerful in Group B, Division One is the Yong'an Haiyou. Huayan is the most promising in Division Two. There are still many battles to come, so wait until there is a little clue before making another narrative.</p>
<h3>Three Provinces Record</h3>
<p>First Round Won against Xinben 2-0 Huayan 2-0</p>
<p>Second Round Won against Xinben 2-0 Huayan 2-0</p>
<p>Looking at the above records, the four wins and four victories of the Three Provinces all won straight sets, two sets to zero. From this, it can be seen that the strength difference is too great. It is easy for the Three Provinces to win the championship. However, strictly speaking, it also makes the team lack interest. The team competition is all hoping to win, but at the same time, it must defeat those of equal strength to be called happy, and to be able to get ball skills progress. If they meet people who are too different in strength, winning is of course gratifying, but there is no doubt that they are not excited enough. Therefore, the author can't help but have some feelings when watching the four games in Three Provinces. It is investigated that the last champion, the Green team, is not without the possibility of forming an army, and the bronze medalist of the last session, the Zhibing team, also has the possibility of gathering, so it is hoped that the two teams will be organized in time to form three with the Three Provinces team, forming a triangular confrontation, it is not what enthusiastic fans of women's volleyball are happy to hear. Then, they can sell tickets at their discretion to fill good deeds. In addition to adding excitement to the too-cold women's league in Muben, it is also beneficial to improve the level of women's water. I hope that the authorities and the above-mentioned three provinces can adopt this point of view or not?</p>
<p>For the majestic appearance of the Three Provinces in this session, there is not enough introduction material, because there is no development under the situation of smashing eggs with stones. Therefore, in general, the whole team has average talent, and both offense and defense are complete. The technical skills of the nine heroines are enough for analysis</p>
<p>Li Bo, a veteran of more than ten years in the sand, is old, and the model is indeed still there. Her backhand pull is still beautiful and unique. Only when she wants to jump over the net, she already sees that she can't do what she wants. In fact, Ms. Li already has a group of children, and it is commendable to have this spirit and be active in the stadium, and she is afraid of seeing it in female athletes.</p>
<p>Chen Meizhen, as the captain of the team, does have real skills. She is tall and skilled. She has a good hand, and she must hit the target when she fires at the edge of the net. She is truly miraculous. In this session, she is more at will for those who have no block gang.</p>
<p>Lu Cuifang, Ms. Lu does not seem to be noticed by the general public, because she never eats merit, and has less chance to share it. In fact, her contribution to helping others win is invaluable. The most important thing for players to pay attention to is cooperation. Therefore, I think she is a successful player.</p>
<p>Chen Liuzhen is Mei Zhen's sister. The pair of Chen sisters has long enjoyed a high reputation in the volleyball world, and has not declined slightly. Liuzhen is in the second row on the right, and can hit and knock well, with enough strength to do it well. However, this year I saw a performance, because I had nowhere to develop.</p>
<p>Shen Meiying. This session was stopped due to Shi Ruijuan's marriage, so Miss Shen is in charge of the second row in the middle. Shen and Meizhen have been old classmates, and they have already achieved good results representing the school team, so they are old partners. In addition to her good at saving the ball, the ball she takes can be used for Mei Zhen to hit, and the tacit understanding between each other is known. Therefore, Shen should be paired with Mei Zhen to be able to see her advantages.</p>
<p>Chen Ze Zhuang is a physical education teacher at China Jinan School, with standard physique, and is in this life here from morning to night, so he has a light and familiar results. However, Ms. Chen has not seen any special results in this session. The author always sees her when she is fighting, and she always has other thoughts, but she also has the qualifications of a veteran, and is willing to take a step back. If she can work hard and go all out, her achievements must be more than this.</p>
<p>Dong Jian is also an old predecessor of the athlete. He has done a lot of research on the 　zizi army, and this time he was invited by Three Provinces to participate in the promised land formation. However, because of his increasingly blessed body and his secluded location in the corner of the third row, there is really no chance to do anything. Looking at his skills, it is obvious that he is old in this way compared to a strong player.</p>
<p>Chen Jie Shu, the mastermind of saving dangerous balls in Three Provinces team. Ms. Chen is short in stature, easy to run and grab, and has sufficient experience. She can often win by surprise and save dangerous balls, and her ball skills are excellent. In addition, Chen's serve is undoubtedly the most powerful in the Three Provinces team, hitting the ball in two steps, being quick and accurate, and is a good talent.</p>
<p>Le Zhusi, because she is in the corner of the third row and the opponent is weak, there are few opportunities. Therefore, Miss Le can be seen as if she had never played before, even under the scorching sun for every game. What about her skills? I dare not make reckless comments. Only Miss Le's always smiling face on the field, gains and losses seem to be irrelevant, her sportsmanship is always clear in this.</p>
<p>The Group A champion, the Zhongbei team, will be introduced after their battle ends. Each part of Group B will definitely have an audit by next week. This article is a congratulatory article after Three Provinces won the women's group championship.</p>
<p>Review</p>
<h3>United Overseas Chinese Defeats White Horse</h3>
<p>The first act of the charity football match organized by the Football Association to raise education funds was a friendly match between the United team and the Portuguese merchants. The second battle was held last weekend, with the rematch between the Zi Ma Qiaolian, who had faced off in the eighth welfare match. Because of the widespread fame of the two teams, their appeal was naturally good. Moreover, with the sudden increase in paddle prices, 2,000 yuan for the grandstand and 5,000 yuan for the inside, it also created a new ticket price. Therefore, in terms of income, it is naturally considerable, which is of great benefit to the education fund.</p>
<p>The result of this game was one to one. According to the battle situation that day, many people criticized that it was lucky for Bai Ma to be able to force each other to one, and maintain it to the end. But I deeply feel that the forwards of the Overseas Chinese Federation have always lacked intellectual performance. They cannot use the method of inducing the enemy to leave their position, and they do not have the accurate shooting skills, so the only way to deal with them is for the guards to use the (Cover goalarea) method. They can only fire aimlessly in the distant area. What's more, Zhang Banglun of Bai Ma has already insight into the trajectory of such a cold arrow. And Zhang's skills are really well-coordinated, so the Overseas Chinese Federation accidentally stole a cold meal in the upper field for three minutes - the Zima position was unstable - after that, although the offensive was so much throughout the game, the forwards unfortunately did not gain anything due to the above reasons. Therefore - my conclusion is, rather than Bai Ma lucky, it is better to say that Bai Ma's guards saw the opponent's path clearly, and managed to maintain no loss in the defensive posture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how can Bai Ma not win the ball? Of course, the forward line is missing the three generals Dai Lingjing, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yao. Before the game, I heard the news that Sun and Li would not be playing, so I wrote it in the previous issue of this journal. Although Li Yichen and Wu Qixiang filled the gap, they would never be as wonderful as the Donghua Five Tigers. What's more, Li Shuchen didn't come, and Dai Lingjing was temporarily absent due to abdominal pain. So Qu Yongfu and Luo Zifu came to fill in. This became a line of rabble, and in the second half, because Qu Yongfu was injured and replaced by Han Chonggen, it appeared even more fragmented. How can you ask for an offensive? In the last twenty minutes, Wu Qixiang saw that it was difficult to perform, and the rear was in a troubled situation, so he retreated to help defend, so Mai Youliang and Han Longhai, who were wandering on the front line, really had the distress of heroes having nowhere to display their martial arts. However, in the extremely rare chance, Bu Yu Youliang or Long Hai got the ball, the two of them could even push forward and penetrate the hinterland. Although they failed to achieve success, the threat to the soldiers was still very serious. From this point as a ten-fold deduction, assuming that the Donghua Five Tigers came to play, dealing with the stupid defense method of the Overseas Chinese Federation, it would be as easy as turning one's hand to defeat Huanglong. From the previous session to this session, the conclusion after the end of this football season, I always dare to say that the five former Donghua forwards are the most suitable to break through the defense of the Overseas Chinese Federation, and they will be ruthless against the Portuguese Merchants team. The entire reason is that they understand the path of others, and they know the cause and effect of how to stop it.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one point of feeling, which seems to be expressed quickly, so I wrote it below.</p>
<p>This is the behavior of the players and the so-called spectators, which cannot give me the most 　impression. Like 　's injury, of course, he slammed into the terrace card and fell down at the same time, everyone was still working hard, and the terrace card was using arm strength to 　injure, which is all that there is no sportsmanship between each other. There was also the entanglement between Bao and Fu Bo, a room 塲, it seems that there is a grudge between these two people, so the general audience is more unnecessarily stimulating 　　, which almost led to a quarrel. I hope that this kind of phenomenon will be absolutely reduced and eliminated in the future. We hope that players should strive for progress in their skills and win victories, but also promote the best sportsmanship, so that the atmosphere of the football world will not retreat but advance, which is what we pray for. This requires a large number of spectators to help and the media to supervise. If we don't know this, can we win the sympathy of all parties? (Amateur Reporter)</p>
<h3>Basketball Group B League Concludes, Youlu Wins the Overall Championship</h3>
<p>— Skinny Man</p>
<p>The Basketball League Group B has been held since March 21st, with a total of seven parts, and after two months of competition, the champions of each part were produced in order, and then a lottery was held for elimination. Among them, in the first round of the finals, Zhenyuan fought against Feima, and Feima won. However, Zhenyuan was dissatisfied with the referee and protested, and the authorities considered it carefully. Later, it was decided that Zhenyuan's protest was not credible, so it could be carried out smoothly. The final scene was held at 6 pm on the other day (14th) in the Sichuan Road Youth Association Gym, where Youlu and Longhua competed, and as a result, Youlu first lost and then won, and won the Group B overall championship.</p>
<p>Basketball Group B Table</p>
<p>Final Battle between Youlu and Longhua</p>
<p>In the final, Youlu and Longhua were both the leaders in Group B, and their water level was not below the ordinary Group A team, and both hired famous basketball generals as guidance. This game is related to Lingyu. Unexpectedly, at the start of the game, the coaches of both teams were not seen to be present, which is really inexplicable. It was not until the end of the first half, when Longhua took the lead, that Youlu coach Kaiqimiluofu arrived and secretly gave instructions, and he saw a change of wind, breaking through the other party's weakness, and then he was able to turn defeat into victory. Finally, he won the Group B overall championship with a score of thirty to twenty-six. From this, it can be seen that the effectiveness of the guidance, its importance is known, if Longhua guidance can also be on the scene, then the judgment of victory or defeat, or there may be unexpected results.</p>
<p>According to the tactics of the two teams, in the first half, both used a five-man zone defense, and Longhua won because he was better at sacrificing. Nai Youlu's guidance taught him a method, that is, to use a man-to-man system when defending. Gai Youlu team members are more powerful, and they should achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the attack is to use the middle road. In addition, the tall body is used for follow-up under the basket, so under the waste, there can still be follow-up opportunities. Longhua Guo was taken advantage of and still 　original　　stable play doctrine. Assuming that Longhua sees the opponent adopting a man-to-man policy, it also changes its strategy, especially when attacking, it can use high speed, then Youlu may not be able to get what it wants.</p>
<p>In addition, the game judges were originally scheduled to be Jin Botao and Zhou 　Bang. Jin had asked Changju for leave the next day, and Zhou 　Bang temporarily did not come. It is said that or Zhou's fear, is based on the frequent right and wrong of the basketball game recently. However, according to the author's observation, he used his law enforcement to see great skills, and his experience is also very sufficient, so he must be blocked by other things. It was temporarily served by Liu Hesheng and Huang Cunrui on the day of the salvation. Liu Hesheng made a speech to the players before the competition, and added encouragement, and the result was quite effective. The two teams only competed up and down in their ball skills, and distinguished the pros and cons in tactics, and there was no rudeness and quarrels, which is a harvest that is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The New Army Youlu Has Unlimited Prospects</p>
<p>Youlu is a rising new army, organized by some students of St. John's University, and has a physical education teacher Qu Ren, a famous player, Kaiji Miluofu as guidance. The team members, with the relationship of classmates, gave the opportunity for considerable practice, and they were able to make rapid progress. And as a student army, the physique is strong. Because of this, the team has become famous, and it has been able to overcome strong enemies and win the Group B overall championship. Its basic team members are roughly the following six generals:</p>
<p>Wang Yuguang - medium stature, serving as a forward, shooting baskets is extremely accurate, is the soul of the team's scoring.</p>
<p>Lin Hongci - the center of the team, because the height is over the people, so interception under the basket, is better than others. It is even more sure to follow up and score. Lin Jun has been training in this way for a long time. It is rare to be calm on the land.</p>

<h3>All Shanghai Baseball Invitational Tournament: Panda Team Wins the Championship After Hard Fought Battles</h3>
<p>— Shan Miao</p>
<p>The baseball movement in Shanghai has been dormant for a long time. Although there has been a softball league in the summer for the past three years, our Chinese have never won a championship. This year, in mid-May, a baseball invitational league was organized by the Japanese expatriate and YMCA authorities. Our Chinese Panda Team was also among those invited. In addition, there were strong teams such as the Japanese expatriate team, the YMCA team, and the Portuguese Merchant team, making a total of four teams participating in the competition. Our Chinese team lived up to expectations, fought bravely and defeated the Japanese expatriates, winning the championship. This is truly the first time in Shanghai's history that our Chinese have won the All-Shanghai Baseball Championship. The details of the league are recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>League Teams Have Average Skill</p>
<p>Among the teams in this league, before the competition, it was generally expected that the Japanese expatriate team would be the strongest, followed by the YMCA, then the Portuguese merchants, and the Chinese Panda team would be the weakest. This was because there were many famous players in the Japanese expatriate team, such as catcher Miura, who was a baseball player at Meiji University in Japan, and the team members were all Japanese expatriates who had studied in the United States, especially pitcher Ueshima, first baseman Iwatate, and third baseman Wakamu were the best. The YMCA and Portuguese Merchant teams each had players who were famous generals in the baseball world with rich experience. Therefore, the Panda team was considered by many to have no hope. However, after the start of the competition, there was no significant difference in the skills of these four teams. Because the league adopted a double round-robin system, each team played against the other teams twice, and each won once, which shows that the skills of the teams were very average. Every game was full of excitement, especially the three hard-fought battles between the Panda team and the Japanese expatriates.</p>
<p>Liang Junyou's Great Contribution</p>
<p>In the first game between the Panda team and the Japanese expatriates, the Panda team was miserably defeated by a score of three to one. In this game, the Panda team did not even have one hit, which was entirely due to the pitching of Mr. Wakamu, the pitcher of the Japanese expatriate team. In the second game, the Panda team, in order to avenge their previous defeat, had coach Liang Fuchu personally play as first baseman. The game was extremely tense. Liang Yousheng, the pitcher of the Panda team, used his superb skills. With a flick of his hand, the ball dropped, and its sharpness caused the Japanese expatriate players to swing at thin air. Third baseman and batter Wen Tianhua and Wen Ruixiong both had excellent performances, so they won a major victory with a score of five to three.</p>
<p>The Japanese Expatriate Generals Became Flustered on the Spot</p>
<p>In the final of the league, the Japanese expatriates and the Panda team competed for the championship. On that day, there were more foreign spectators than Chinese. The odds of betting on the victory of the game were three to one, that is, most people thought that the Japanese expatriates would win. As everyone knows, in this game, Ueshima served as the pitcher for the Japanese expatriates. This gentleman was flustered in the second and fourth innings and made many mistakes. For example, in the second inning, Wen Duanxiong of the Chinese team hit a wonderful ball to first base. When running to second base, Ueshima hurriedly threw the ball to second baseman Somekawa, but who knew that the force of the throw was too great, and the ball flew straight out of the field, and left fielder Ueno missed the catch again, so Wen Ruixiong ran back to home base and scored a point. Again, in the fourth inning, Li Qiteng of the Chinese team used a bunt. Ueshima moved forward to catch the ball and hurriedly threw it to first base. Due to being flustered, the force was too great, causing first baseman Iwatate to fail to catch it, and Li Qisheng had stolen to third base. In this game, pitcher Liang Yousheng once again used his superb skills, greatly displaying his sharp and curved ball, causing the Japanese expatriate team to only have Ueshima get a "triple" in the sixth inning. As a result of the game, the Panda team won the championship with a major victory of seven to three.</p>
<p>Panda Team's Hard-Fought Spirit Surpasses Others</p>
<p>In this championship game, in addition to the lack of composure of the Japanese expatriate team members, the spirit of the Chinese team was commendable. The Chinese team had the ambition to win and had to defeat the Japanese team. Therefore, before the game, coach Liang Fuchu repeatedly told them to fight with an indomitable spirit, so that there was hope of winning. Therefore, the Panda team members calmly dealt with the game. In the third and fourth innings, they killed four Japanese expatriate players who were stealing bases. Their agility and speed were excellent, and there were many wonderful scenes, which were highly praised by the audience, making it impossible for the Japanese expatriates to steal bases and only able to sigh helplessly. Pitcher Liang Yousheng threw out six people in a row (Strike out), and still endured the pain and threw fiercely because of leg cramps. On the other hand, the Japanese expatriate team members lost their fighting spirit in the sixth and seventh innings due to excessive score loss. Therefore, after the game, Miura, the catcher of the Japanese expatriate team, sighed and said: "The victory of the Panda team in this battle is actually due to their spirit surpassing us."</p>
<h3>Essentials of Basketball Theory (21)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>Although modern basketball offense is as described above, it is very important to know how to use it to generate effectiveness. Most teams with a higher level of play use the above tactics in this way. After each time gaining possession of the ball bounced back from the opponent's backboard, they must first use a fast break, taking advantage of the opponent's lack of preparation or slow retreat, using a straight-line pass, a long pass to the teammate under the basket for a "steal". Or using a single person, rushing forward, dribbling the ball straight into the heart of the enemy, and shooting forward. The purpose of the ambush attack is to attack the enemy's unpreparedness, or to gang up on the opponent with two-on-one or three-on-two, especially two-on-one, which is the most effective. When the opponent has three people retreating to the backcourt to defend, the possibility of a fast break gradually disappears. Therefore, when starting the offense after gaining possession of the ball, if you see that the opponent is retreating quickly and defending tightly, you cannot use a fast break, but you must use a slow offensive positional war. On one hand, the two guards pass the ball to each other, passing it over the mid-line. On the other hand, the center and two forwards move towards the field, deploy the battle line, adapt to the situation, and use various slow offensive methods or delay tactics. The main purpose of using a slow offensive positional war is to break the five-man zone defense, lure the enemy away from their positions, and take advantage of the weakness to attack. When the game is about to end and our side has scored more points, we can also use the perimeter passing method to maintain possession of the ball, without attacking again to achieve the final victory. However, if the opponent is smart, they will definitely switch to the "man-to-man" defense method, forcing our side to attack, so as to seize our side's lost ball and launch a counterattack. At this time, our side has to change its tactics and use blocking offense to restrain them. The most important thing in using the blocking method is to find a way to block one of the main enemies, so that they cannot get out in time to seize our side's ball, so that our side's ball holder can avoid the enemy's tight marking, follow the predetermined offensive route, and safely rush straight to the basket and shoot in. When blocking people, you must avoid touching the opponent's body and committing a foul, and you must also prevent the opponent from knowing it in advance, otherwise the opponent will use the switch defense method to prepare in advance, and our side will lose all its efforts. However, if the opponent sees our side switching to this method, they will definitely adopt the five-man zone defense method again, then our side has no choice but to use a slow offense to break it, which is the most common way to use the Sichuan offense.</p>
<p>Offensive and defensive skills and theories have been described above, but how to make them a reality, not just in theory, is related to other important issues, which instructors and players must carefully study, one is the instructor's own problem, and the other is the player's mental cultivation problem. These are described below.</p>
<p>Instructor's own problems: The instructor is like the chief of staff and commander-in-chief of the two armies fighting on the battlefield. They should have a thorough understanding of various offensive and defensive formations and the knowledge related to the application of tactics. If they only have a superficial understanding, it will be difficult to cope with the situation in battle. Therefore, an instructor must know the skills, abilities, physical and psychological states of their team's players, and must also be aware of all the circumstances of the game, such as the timing, location, and the opponent's strength and tactics. The so-called knowing yourself and knowing your enemy, you can win every battle.</p>
<p>When adopting offensive and defensive tactics, the team's players' abilities, age, physique, physical strength, and personality should be the main considerations, so that the tactics can suit the players' own conditions. You cannot force the tactics to fit the players. If the offensive and defensive tactics are good, but the players' abilities are insufficient, or the tactics require a lot of energy, but the players' physical strength is not enough, or the tactics require extremely agile movements, but the players are older and slower in personality, then they are ignorant of the excellence of the tactics. If they are adopted rashly, they will inevitably fail. Therefore, no matter what kind of excellent offensive and defensive tactics are adopted, they must be tailored to the players' own situation, which is the condition for winning.</p>
<p>Before the game, you should understand the strength and weakness of the opponent's ability, the speed of their movements, and the offensive and defensive tactics they use, so as to stipulate the methods that our team should use to deal with them. For example, if the opposing team is strong, our side must defend more than attack. If the opposing team is weaker than our side, our side should attack more than defend. If the opposing team moves slowly, we should use a fast break. On the contrary, if they move quickly, we should use a slow offensive positional war. In other cases, during the competition, we must also pay attention to all changes at all times, such as the tension and relaxation of the situation, the impact of the size of the audience and the venue, the location and the timing, and the difference between the time and the score. For example, if there is still a long time, the scores are equal; or if the time is about to end, the scores are far apart; or if the time is about to end, the scores are equal. All of these factors are very important. We should understand the situation and its evolution, adapt to the situation, and change tactics. We must not stick to the old ways.</p>
<p>Player's Mental Cultivation Problems</p>
<p>In addition to the player's skill and technical training, they must achieve excellent results, and must also pay attention to their mental cultivation. The most important aspects of mental cultivation are cooperation and the spirit of struggle, which are briefly described below.</p>
<p>The spirit of cooperation is a very important training in modern basketball. The success of all offensive and defensive tactics depends entirely on the ability to cooperate, because basketball is a collective effort, not a game that can be played individually. However, although cooperation is not a performance of personal skills, it is impossible to cooperate if the individual's basic movements are not proficient. The failure of offensive and defensive tactics is not initially due to the poor formation, but mostly due to a lack of knowledge and the rawness of individual basic movements. Because the players have no grasp of the basic movements, the entire team's movements cannot be connected. For example, if the receiver wants to catch the ball, the passer cannot pass it. If the passer wants to pass the ball, there is no one to receive it, or there is an opportunity to shoot but it is inaccurate, or the thinking is not quick, and the movements are not agile, resulting in the opponent breaking through. Strict defense, even if there is an opportunity to attack, it cannot achieve the goal. All of these are closely related to cooperation. Therefore, the first priority of modern basketball teams is to instill and cultivate a spirit of cooperation. This is not only true for new teams, but also for well-trained teams. Especially the so-called teams that are satisfied with their collective skills, their decline is invariably due to only focusing on personal technical performance and the loosening of cooperation. The spirit of cooperation is not only refers to technical movements. Other factors such as an indomitable, calm, unproud, and non-depressed mentality and emotions, and even all actions, words, spirit, attitude, etc., are closely related to cooperation.</p>
<p>The spirit of struggle is also what is emphasized in today's basketball training. Because basketball is a competitive sport, players must have both wisdom and courage, and must also have a spirit of struggle. In a game between two teams, although the technical aspects are very important, most of it depends on the players' perseverance in the struggle, which is the key to determining victory or defeat. Therefore, players should have an indomitable and unrelenting spirit of struggle. From the moment the whistle blows until the end of the game, their spirit should be vigorous, and they should bravely move forward, without being subdued by the opponent's pressure or the reversal of the situation. Even if they unfortunately fail due to technical reasons, their spirit must remain consistent from beginning to end. Even a moment of slackness is not allowed. Such a team, even if it loses, is still glorious. You must never develop the bad habit of only being able to win and not being able to lose. It is common to see some teams that are on the verge of victory, but when the opponent intensifies the pursuit and the scores are close, the players become panicked. Success fails, and they are defeated by others. This is indeed the key to success or failure, and it is a common problem that everyone is prone to. This is nothing more than a lack of perseverance in the struggle, and the result will inevitably be defeat. They should do their best, and should not be intimidated and discouraged by the opponent's temporary success.</p>

<h3>All Shanghai Softball League: Panda Team to Play Next Week</h3>
<p>The Panda Team participated in the All Shanghai Softball League last year, finishing as runner-up. This time, winning the baseball championship can be said to have fulfilled their wish. This year's All Shanghai Softball League has already started on June 10th. There are as many as seven teams participating in Group A, including famous teams such as Japanese Expatriates, Panda, YMCA, Foreign Expatriates, and Portuguese Merchants. After winning the baseball championship this time, the Panda Team will show their skills in the softball game. The Panda Team is scheduled to play against the Knights at 4:30 pm on Tuesday, June 19th, on Wuxing Road (Old Pan Sheng Road) (that is, on the road where the 可的牛奶棚 big windmill is located on Avenue Joffre). Fans are welcome to support the Hua team's softball style. What the Panda Team should pay attention to in this game is that the players in the Knights team are good at stealing bases and often like to use bunts to get on base. Pitcher Li Qiteng should pay close attention to this. Also, Liang Yousheng will serve as the shortstop in the softball game, and fans can appreciate his agile catching and killing. Also, catcher Wang Xiushan will also be on the team to help. At the same time, Wen Tianhua, Wen Ruixiong and other basemen and outfielders Wang Nianzi, Tang Weiye, Liang Youwen, etc., will also show their skills. (Shan Miao)</p>
