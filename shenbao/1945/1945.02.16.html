<h3>克拉克山岳地帶連日展開激戰中　日海軍陸戰隊突擊敵後方</h3>
<p>菲律賓基地十五日中央社電　日海軍陸戰隊與陸軍部隊相呼應，於克拉克山岳地帶，速日展開激戰，予敵企圖痛烈打擊，二月十二日，敵軍又率土民軍侵人日軍陣地，反覆發動攻擊，經日海軍陸戰隊勇猛肉搏後，予以甚大損害。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地十五日中央社電　日海軍陸戰隊之突擊隊，曾於二月九日自馬尼刺遠方深入敵軍戰綫後方，而襲擊其後方陣地宿營，結果炸毀其大砲六門。又日軍曾急襲狼狽逃潰之敵軍將校等十數名，悉予劍斬後，始凱旋而返。</p>
<p>呂宋前綫十五日中央社電　馬尼刺市街戰，乃極凄壯之衝鋒戰，美軍爲達其目的，向以犧牲菲人爲手段，爰美軍於衝入馬尼刺之際，先使多數匪賊潛入市內各處，恣意放火，同時，並煽動馬尼刺市民，更予以武器，復驅使往美軍之第一綫，充當抵禦日軍之砲灰。此外，尙在美軍各陣地前面配置武裝住民，以防日軍衝鋒隊之銳鋒，茲一部住民業與匪軍合流，乘機恣意掠奪，故歷史紀念物之敎堂等，多被破毀，今馬尼刺市內，因爾軍之血戰與暴徒之肆虐，現巳化爲人間地獄矣。</p>
<p>日陸海軍確保馬尼剌南地區</p>
<p>呂宋前綫十五日中央社電　敵軍侵入馬尼刺以來，業達旬日，目下敵罩正連日以數百輛之車輛繼續對衝入市內之敵軍增援補給，對日軍陣地施以密集之砲擊，藉此砲火之掩護，反覆來襲，然日海軍部隊與陸軍部隊緊密協力下，連日奮勇應戰，十三日依然確保巴西克河下流四大橋樣南方地區及自巴科基地南北綫至西加倫道路確保加里那間，並嚴守南方尼哥爾斯飛機塲東方地區及十二日夜西山大尉隊突擊佔領之巴西克河上流北岸陣地，連日仍續行猛攻中。日軍部隊長曾訓示各隊全員謂：「全員應奮勇殺敵，如與後方斷絕援助時，或步行困難之際，應努力克服，發揮日本男兒之名譽」。全軍鬥志極爲堅固，七名之肉攻突擊隊，曾突入敵陣，以手榴彈破壞十二生的迫擊砲二門，八生的迫擊砲四門，並斃敵軍數十名，歸途中，復又擊斃敵軍官，奪取重要文書，刻下各戰綫正到處展開肉搏攻擊，美軍損失愈益慘重，因此，敵軍自十三日巳於市街南方巴塞地區海岸市街，藝波羅俱樂部附近構築迫擊砲重機槍陣地。</p>
<p>考列基多海面發現敵方艦隊</p>
<p>呂宋前線十五日中央社電　敵近企圖强行侵入馬尼刺灣，十三日上午九時三十分，以戰艦二艘，巡洋艦四艘，驅遂艦五艘所編成之艦隊，出現於考列基多鳥海面，除實施艦砲射擊外，同時並加以熾烈之轟炸，斯時，科列基多之日軍砲臺，乃奮勇應戰。是晚，敵復以掃海艇二十艘，出現於考列基多鳥北水道，結果被日方擊沉其一艘。又敵後方運輸船約十艘，已向該方面緊迫，敵自一月二十六日以降，曾偵察呂宋鳥北方之阿帕里地帶，並激烈攻擊，迨至二月後，即連日偵察，十三日上午十一時三十分，乃以艦載機一百架對阿帕里海岸一帶連續施行轟炸與機槍掃射，約達半小時以上。</p>
<p>呂宋前線十五日中央社電　敵對攻陷馬尼刺作戰，極爲焦急，現正增强南下部隊兵力及努力於那斯克布斯比茲克灣上陸部隊之前進，更企圖進侵馬尼刺灣，連日曾繼續對考列基多鳥加以偵察及轟炸，十三日午前九時，並以艦艇接近海岸，更於是日十一時以掃海艇對考列基多島北側之馬尼刺灣海峽，開始掃海作戰，同時並加以猛烈轟炸，該島之日軍守備部隊，於敵猛炸之下，開始必中之砲擊，結果擊沉敵掃海艇一艘，該海峽亦仍由日軍確保中</p>
<h3>敵大型驅艦　一艘被擊沉</h3>
<p>菲律賓基地十五日中央社電　日軍潛水艦，二月九日下午，於民答那峨海附近包圍敵大型驅逐艦，加以必殺雷擊後，將之擊</p>
<h3>尼米資已發表司令部設關島</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　美太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資發表，新司令部之所在地，已設於關島。該項消息發表後，美聯社前線訪員謂，司令部遷至極爲危險之關島，其要旨如次：因該島尙有多數日軍潛伏，隨時隨地均有發射狙擊之可能，故無一塲所可謂安全地帶，最危險地帶，即爲人跡稀少之密林地帶，因之美軍對掃蕩此項殘存日軍頗費苦心。</p>
<h3>敵機約六十架　昨襲名古屋　邀擊戰果正在調查中</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日大本營十五日下午五時五十分發表：十五日下午，敵機約六十架，以主力向名古屋分二部來襲靜岡及三重縣，至邀擊戰果正調查中，日方地上設施受若干損害。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　馬利亞納基地之敵B29型機約六十架，自十五日下午一時三十分至三時餘，來襲中部地區，其主力目標向名古屋工塲地帶，一部於該市內外投下炸彈及燒夷彈，致令地上發生火災，而受若干損害。餘一部少數機隊，則轟炸宇治山田，結果該地亦受相當損失，但神宮却平安如常。嗣敵機又於濱松市內外及濱名湖沿岸及靜岡等地　彈，惟該地殆未受損害。以此次來襲視之，敵機俱爲十架以下之小編隊，蓋爲避免再度發生前數次大編隊來襲，而終被日機邀擊，於遁入雲空中之狼狽情形，可見其技倆之拙劣，至此已暴露無餘矣，由此可推測，敵今後將採取小編隊主義。</p>
<h3>呂宋島作戰　美軍損失</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　美聯社前綫消息，麥克沃塞司令部十四日戰報刋稱，美軍於呂宋鳥開始作戰以來，迄今五週內，全部損害達九千六百八十名。</p>
<h3>魯省日軍　一月份戰果</h3>
<p>靑鳥十五日中央社電　山東地區之日軍十三日以來，在魯東，魯北，魯南一帶對重慶延安兩系敵軍，展開勇猛之作戰，某隊日軍一另份收獲綜合戰果如次：（一）重慶系軍交戰二十二次，敵兵力六千一百名，敵遣屍三四三，俘虜三九名，鹵獲丰溜彈六二〇，佩劍一〇九，長槍二一〇，彈藥一〇三，及其他軍需品多數。（二）延安系軍交戰一六次，敵兵力五千七百名，敵遣屍二八三名，俘虜一七，鹵獲手溜彈二七〇，佩劍五三，長槍一四七，彈藥六六五，其他軍需多數。此外一月五日以來敵機塲各一處及濱海區根據地，悉遭破壞，敵軍之反攻企圖，大受挫折。</p>
<h3>京市府等派員調查蘇北食油</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　首都物資平價維紀委員會，爲使京市食油來源暢通起見，特商請實業部南京市政府及市商會三機關負責赴蘇北調查該區產量情况，以便大批採購運京，以供市民需求。茲悉該三繼關已將負責人員派定於今（十六日）出發赴蘇北調查。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論三國會議</h3>
<p>本月初開始舉行的羅斯福·邱吉爾·史太林反軸心三巨頭會談，已於十一日宣吿結束。關於這次會談的經緯，可能的內容，及三國間的矛盾和陰謀，本報日前社評已扼要的申論過了，事實的發展，大致當也不會出於我們所論的範圍。</p>
<p>三頭聚首的地方是在克里米亞靠黑海岸的雅爾太，羅斯福·邱吉爾不惜又一次長途跋涉，遠赴海外，就敎於史太林，三頭會談中史太林所居地位的重要，於此可知。按照實情，赤色軍事勢力現下確比英美發展得迅速而廣汎，政治勢力所及，也已遠在英美之上，蘇聯的自大和史太林的高傲，不是偶然的。</p>
<p>不過三顯會談雖已宣吿結束，現除十三日發表了一個籠統的所謂共同宣言之外，還沒有見到有若何具體內容公佈。共同宣言似側重於軍事方面及如何對付德國問題，然而他們在這些上面却仍舊賣着關子，據稱三國已商定較從前更爲密切的聯合軍事計劃，但須待實施時始行宣佈。又據稱三國並已決定使德國無條件投降之計劃，但須待最後擊敗德國時始能宣告。共同宣言中曾表示他們要把戰爭時間縮短，並威迫德國迅速屈服且賠償損失，由此可見他們對於戰爭再拖延下去的焦慮，及對待德國的狠辣。可是正如德國外部發言人所稱：德人寗願忍受痛苦，澈底犧牲，雅爾太公報反足激發德人敵愾同仇的心理。顯然的，英美蘇期待德國輕易屈服而早日結束戰爭，完全是一種妄想。</p>
<p>關於國際政治問題，三頭已曾多方面談過，那是一定的。但他們對政治問題似更持秘不洩露的能度。這不外爲了：（一）他們以犧牲各小國爲目標、有着種種陰謀，須極端保持機密；（二）他們以劃分勢力範圍爲中心，有着重重的矛盾，需要愼重加以掩飾。</p>
<p>就波蘭問題和法國問題上，已經很明顯的透露出英美蘇把持世界壓迫弱小的陰謀了。據說三頭會談中已决定改組波蘭政府，將設「波蘭國民聯合政府」，如何設立政府也全要他們國外人來支配，不是十十足足包辦內政是什麼？靠英美支持並利用英美蘇的矛盾而成長的法國特戈爾政機，雄心是相當大的，法國人現在仍在熱中於擠上其頭等國家的地位，但却給英美蘇壓制了，傳這次會談前特戈爾曾一再要求參加，始終被摒棄於外。這一切的一切，實包藏着未來國際局面依然將動盪不安的因子。</p>
<p>至英美蘇三國間的矛盾，尤其英美和蘇聯之問的矛盾，他們縱欲掩飾，也常隨時隨地暴露。雅爾太會談前羅斯福·邱吉爾曾先在馬爾太島作商談，然後始聯袂飛往會晤史太林，這裏便也是呈示着三國間的微妙關係。他們的矛盾，斷非一朝一夕所可解消。聽說四月中旬還要在舊金山開一「反軸心國會議」，將邀請各反軸心國家與會，我們仍舊可以預料，這一未來的會談，還是不會有什麼成就。</p>
<h3>日空軍轟炸　他馬多機塲　伊洛瓦底河流域激戰</h3>
<p>緬甸前線十五日中央社電　伊洛瓦底河流域之日軍，與敵英印軍曾展開激烈之作戰，緬甸方面之日空軍，十二日夜對緦播東方約二十公里，伊洛瓦河畔新格對岸之交姆附近之敵軍渡河據點及兵力軍需等，猛加空襲，倉庫四所中彈起火，運軍汽車十輛炸毀，日空軍全隊安然歸還。</p>
<p>緬甸前線十五日中央社電　駐印敵空軍，在北緬地區及印緬地區設立機塲數處，刻經日空軍連續猛襲，其企圖悉遭粉碎，十二日空軍再度猛襲知谷西方五十公里森林內新設之他馬多機塲，炸毀敵機七架，五架起火，其他軍事設施大受損害，日機全部安然歸還。</p>
<h3>武部長官談　增强戰力</h3>
<p>新京十五日中央社電　滿洲國武部總務長官，頃就中日滿三國產業再配置及與此有關之問題談稱：中日滿間之產業再配置問題，必須立脚於高度之綜合觀點，因之滿洲國之戰力增强方策，亦隨此新構想而增長，即於過去對戰爭担當原料供給任務之外，更須勞力，於航空機等決戰兵器之生產，以使資源成爲第一綫戰力。關於新構想之實施，有新工塲之建立與日本工塲之遷移兩辦法，現正於日政府積極支援之下進行辦理中。又對於新工業之移入與建設，除工塲技術外，幷愈想今後日本企業者亦有對滿進出之必要，對此，除特殊情形外，將努力於日本優秀企業者之自由來滿，並與在滿各企業同樣，若其企業遭受危險，則由國家負責，以資補助。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦消息：邱吉爾首相，艾登外相及亞歷山大元帥，於雅爾達會議歸來，星期三抵達雅典。</p>
<h3>智利對日宣戰</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　聖地牙哥電，智利政府十四日發表正式對日宣戰。</p>
<h3>德在維斯社拉　防禦戰獲勝　蘇軍圖包圍布累斯勞</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　海通社訊：東線德軍現已調集更多之軍隊，屢作反攻，中路目格羅高至施尼台默爾全區之戰事，仍在調兵遣將與爭奪橋頭之準備階段。蘇軍於渡越沃特河後，始能再作推攻，目前尙未發展至此。紅軍在卡明與斯韋茲間企圖向但澤推進，以擊破德軍維斯杜拉戰線，過去二十四小時來，德軍在該區獲得防禦戰之全勝。下西里西亞區之蘇軍，自以爲已完成進攻之準備，然其行動，尙朱如初料之順利。哥尼夫上將目沃特河上游於史泰諾區，再圖在甘斯與柯斯頓勃魯間切斷布累斯勞之駐軍、布累斯勞與西方間最後之交通線，沿路現有激戰，以後之四十八小時內即可決定孤立布累斯勞之目的，是否得以實現。過去二十四小時來布累斯勞以西之戰事，使哥尼夫上將不得不重新部署其軍隊。蘇軍在里格尼茲·耶爾·瑙麥克特區結集大量之坦克車與機械化步兵，此項部署巳影響及於波伯河之戰事，蘇軍一部殆已目該區撤退。德軍退出彭茲勞後，蘇軍在若干點之進展已達奎士河，薩根區僅有局部之戰事。蘇軍現猛攻格羅高堡壘，因該地直接封鎭目沃特河至薩根與里格尼茲，科特布斯之汽車路。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國社訊：德軍發言人於星期三午刻宣稱：西里西亞南部之薩根縝，仍在德軍固守中，蘇軍之攻擊，皆遭該鎭之德守軍擊退。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國社訊：東普魯士之埃爾平陷落後，蘇軍已開始重整並補充其死傷衆多之衝鋒編隊，紅軍並增派援軍至諾茄特河下游，哥尼斯堡前綫各地區戰事已見鬆懈。沿海公路之走廊，業已由德軍略加擴大，戰事重心所在地之靜頓東部，蘇軍坦克軍之進攻在激烈之巷戰中被阻。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國社聞諸有資格方面稱：俄　解放軍爲一獨立之分隊，其總司令福拉索夫中將執有懲戒之權力，根據其軍事上之需要委任各軍官，該軍之參謀畏爲德魯金將軍。</p>
<p>西綫攻勢已顯疲象</p>
<p>柏林十中央社電　海通社訊：西綫敵軍之大規模攻勢，已漸顯示其疲象，自尼美根至特里爾長三百公里之戰綫上，德軍抵抗極烈，加軍於突破第一道防綫後，企圖突破萊因河之下游未逞，英加軍於此戰時，被切斷殲滅者甚多。在繆斯河及羅爾河前綫之英第二軍及美第九軍已準備大攻，美第一及第三軍則在埃斐爾及沙爾河間從事惡戰，英美軍之右翼，犧牲甚大，德軍寸土必爭，每一渡頭均經爭奪戰。普魯姆城戰事極爲猛烈，在十二小時內碉堡之易手者凡六次，美軍正企圖突破埃斐爾之德西綫，德盧邊境之礪堡爭奪戰，極爲猛烈，五日間敵軍已進行其亞琛第五次之大攻勢。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國社訊：德軍事發言人昨指出，西綫右翼各區之大水與溶水，已使英美軍對該處德軍陣地之大規模攻勢，爲之遲緩。目下天氣已使反軸心軍意圖展開大攻勢之各地區，成爲沼澤，德軍之反攻，亦有强大之效果。</p>

<h3>冬賑委員會　將施發寒衣　刻正辦理調查及登記</h3>
<p>上海特別市政府卅三年度冬賑委員會爲體念時艱拯恤窮黎起見，積極籌備施賑寒衣工作，日夜督工趕製大批待施棉衣（包括大中小人及男女服），頃已完全竣工，業於日前由該會籌賑組副主任黃警頑，會同稽核組副主任馮詢臣等，前往製衣廠騐收完畢，核尙與原定價格相符。茲悉該會當局刻正發動各區慈善團體，分別調查及登記確實貧苦待賑者，以無任何嗜好爲限，該會並印就申請登記表，托市鄕各慈善團體代爲分發。凡欲申請者，應向指定地點索取，依次塡寫，經派員調查確實，方爲有效</p>
<h3>南區將　複查戶口</h3>

<h3>華鐵防止舞弊　應澈底實行</h3>
<p>華鐵之肅正綱紀，迄已年餘，且爲全中國民衆之切實要求，唯最近因列車行駛次數不足，關於車票問題，頗有助長華鐵職員不法行爲之傾向。華鐵當局固已實行防止舞弊對策，然其對策尙欠澈底，甚至對於此種不法行爲有諱辯爲「不可抗力」之態度，殊屬遺憾。而華鐵職員對於米糧蒐買工作之有意識的或無意識的妨害，尤爲各方面非難之的。蓋關係當局於米糧與飛機戰車同爲遂行大東亞戰爭武器之信念下，出動蒐買挺身隊，同時再三要求華鐵當局，對於爲蒐買米糧而往來內地上海間之工作員，在購買車票時予以特別便利，且於正式身份證明書上明記：「關於交通及其他，請予便利」。藉以喚起華鐵從業員注意，並正式發行車票申請書，與華鐵當局成立諒解，對持有申請書者，得優先發售，但華鐵職員因此種持有特別身份證明書及特別申請書者，頗難向之索取小費，特以種種口實，故意不售車票，以致米糧蒐買工作亦受其妨害。</p>
<p>此種事實，已證明華鐵職員如何利用其職權，而肆行貪汚，此事已或關係當局憤激之的。華鐵本社及現場各機關之首腦者，幾全體爲日本人，彼等動輒聲稱「不法行爲係中國人所爲，實非得已」等，實有諉其責任於中國人，而未能自負全資，斷然實行肅正工作之嫌。最近，對於華鐵，「華鐵精神何在」之非難聲已囂囂市上。</p>
<p>妨害米糧蒐買工作之華鐵職員，須從速檢舉，斷然於上海站廣塲上槍決，此種呼聲，尙望該社最高首腦者反省，從速實行緊急對策，同時亦應採取一般車票不法行爲之撲滅對策。</p>
<p>登車時留難</p>
<p>A氏談　先前崑山米統會辦事處因急須調度蒐買資金，故派職員即時由江蘇辦事處及關係指導當局籌得約六千元，携之欲乘快車返崑，焉知蘇州站員故意留難，終不得登車。而崑山方面農民正待現金支付，苟遲付一日，對於工作即有不良影響，其後幸得日軍士兵見諒，認爲米糧工作確很重要，始得與日軍同乘貨車歸返崑山。此種類例，不勝枚舉。縱係貌似舞女之女客，祗須出錢，即可搭乘快車，而有重要公務者，竟被擯諸車外，華鐵職員豈儘食車票而不吃飯者乎？</p>
<p>擲還申請書</p>
<p>B氏談　余爲嘉興方面之蒐買工作者，因接洽公事而來上海，事畢擬返嘉興，當持特別申請書於晨四時即至售票處列隊守候，迨七時發售車票，售票員察看申請書後，即日：憑此亦欲購稟乎？是時，在余前後之人竟皆購得車票，唯余獨無，結果祇得待至翌日方歸，華鐵此種不法職員，希望處以槍決。（譯自二月十五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>財政部修正運鈔護照辦法</h3>
<p>關於商民運輸鈔票，前經財政部規定，如在十萬元以上者，須向該部請領護照，惟現因生活高漲、物價激增、現鈔需要旣增，携運自亦較多，財部有鑒於此，時將原定運鈔護照辦法第二條超過十萬元須領護照之規定，修正爲超過三十萬元以應需要，業經通吿、自本年二月十六日起實施。</p>
<h3>保甲人員　佩用新臂章</h3>
<p>關於本市警察局所轄各區之保甲人員及自警團各級隊長曁團員所佩之臂章，業經規定式樣，指定印刷所派員監製，各區陸續具領，並照式添印分發偑用。所有各區以前之舊臂章，因過去各自製備，參差不齊，甚至一聯保有單獨自行辦理者，如不加整理，則流弊滋多，爰由市警局保甲自警團團本部定於本月份起，凡各區保甲及自警人員之舊臂章，一律禁止佩用，並即檢齊繳送本團部註銷，同時即日起佩帶新臂章。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Continue in the Clark Mountain Area; Japanese Naval Landing Forces Assault Enemy Rear</h3>
<p>Philippines Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - In coordination with army units, Japanese naval landing forces quickly launched fierce battles in the Clark Mountain area, dealing a severe blow to the enemy's plans. On February 12th, enemy forces again led local militias to invade Japanese positions, launching repeated attacks, but after fierce hand-to-hand combat by the brave Japanese naval landing forces, they inflicted great damage.</p>
<p>Philippines Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - A commando unit of the Japanese naval landing forces penetrated deep behind enemy lines from the vicinity of Manila on February 9th, attacking their rear positions and encampments, resulting in the destruction of six artillery pieces. Furthermore, Japanese forces ambushed and routed over a dozen fleeing enemy officers and others, killing them all with swords before returning in triumph.</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The street fighting in Manila is an extremely tragic and valiant affair. The American forces, to achieve their goals, are sacrificing Filipinos. When the American troops charged into Manila, they first had a large number of bandits sneak into various parts of the city to set fires at will. At the same time, they incited the citizens of Manila, provided them with weapons, and drove them to the front lines of the American forces to act as cannon fodder against the Japanese. In addition, armed residents are stationed in front of American positions to defend against the sharp attacks of Japanese assault troops. Some of these residents have joined forces with bandits, taking the opportunity to plunder at will. Therefore, historical monuments such as churches have been largely destroyed. The city of Manila has now become a living hell due to the bloody battles of the Allied forces and the rampage of the mobs.</p>
<p>Japanese Army and Navy Secure the Southern Area of Manila</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - It has been ten days since enemy forces invaded Manila. Currently, the enemy is continuously reinforcing and supplying the enemy forces surging into the city with hundreds of vehicles every day, subjecting Japanese positions to intense artillery bombardment. Under the cover of this artillery fire, they launch repeated attacks. However, with the close cooperation of Japanese naval and army units, they have fought bravely every day. On the 13th, they continued to secure the southern area of the four bridges downstream of the Pasig River and the area between Garina, secured from the north-south line of the Paco base to the Sicalen Road. They also strictly defended the eastern area of the Nichols Field south of the city and the northern bank position of the upper Pasig River, which was captured by Captain Nishiyama's unit in a surprise attack on the night of the 12th, continuing their fierce offensive. The Japanese unit commander instructed all members of each unit, saying: "All members should bravely kill the enemy. If aid is cut off from the rear or when walking becomes difficult, they should strive to overcome these difficulties and uphold the honor of Japanese men." The morale of the entire army is extremely firm. A seven-man flesh-and-blood assault team broke into enemy lines, destroying two 120mm mortars and four 80mm mortars with hand grenades, and killing dozens of enemy soldiers. On the way back, they also killed an enemy officer and seized important documents. Currently, hand-to-hand combat is raging everywhere on all fronts, and American losses are becoming increasingly severe. Therefore, since the 13th, enemy forces have constructed mortar and heavy machine gun positions in the southern coastal area of the city, the Basse district, and near the Ybor Club.</p>
<p>Enemy Fleet Discovered off Corregidor</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy recently attempted to forcibly invade Manila Bay. At 9:30 AM on the 13th, a fleet consisting of two battleships, four cruisers, and five destroyers appeared off Corregidor Island, conducting naval bombardment and intense aerial attacks. At that time, the Japanese batteries on Corregidor bravely returned fire. That evening, the enemy reappeared with twenty minesweepers in the northern waterway of Corregidor Island, resulting in one being sunk by Japanese forces. Furthermore, about ten enemy transport ships were approaching that area. Since January 26th, the enemy has been reconnoitering the Aparri area north of Luzon Island and attacking fiercely. After February, they continued reconnaissance for days. At 11:30 AM on the 13th, they continuously bombed and strafed the Aparri coastal area with 100 carrier-based aircraft for over half an hour.</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy is extremely anxious to capture Manila. They are currently increasing the strength of the southbound forces and striving to advance the landing forces in Nasugbu and Subic Bays, and also attempting to invade Manila Bay. They have continued to reconnoiter and bomb Corregidor Island for days. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, they approached the coast with warships, and at 11:00 AM that day, they began minesweeping operations in the Manila Bay Strait north of Corregidor Island while carrying out intense bombing. The Japanese garrison on the island launched accurate fire under the enemy's heavy bombardment, resulting in the sinking of one enemy minesweeper. The strait remains secured by Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Enemy Large Destroyer - One Sunk</h3>
<p>Philippines Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of February 9th, a Japanese submarine surrounded an enemy large destroyer near the Mindanao Sea, and after a sure-kill torpedo attack, sank it.</p>
<h3>Nimitz Has Announced Headquarters Established in Guam</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz announced that the new headquarters is now located in Guam. After the announcement, an Associated Press frontline reporter said that the key points of moving the headquarters to the extremely dangerous Guam are as follows: Because many Japanese soldiers are still hiding on the island, there is always the possibility of sniper fire anytime and anywhere, so no area can be called a safe zone. The most dangerous areas are the sparsely populated dense forests, so the US military is making great efforts to sweep away these remaining Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>About Sixty Enemy Planes - Attacked Nagoya Yesterday - Results of Interception Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:50 PM on the 15th: In the afternoon of the 15th, about sixty enemy aircraft, with the main force attacking Nagoya in two groups, raided Shizuoka and Mie Prefectures. The results of the interception are currently under investigation, and Japanese ground facilities suffered some damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - About sixty enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana base raided the central region from 1:30 PM to a little after 3:00 PM on the 15th. Their main target was the Nagoya factory area, and a portion dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in and around the city, causing fires and some damage on the ground. The remaining small group of aircraft bombed Ujiyamada, resulting in considerable damage to the area, but the Ise Grand Shrine remained safe as usual. Subsequently, enemy aircraft also bombed in and around Hamamatsu, along the coast of Lake Hamana, and in Shizuoka, but the area suffered little damage. Judging from this raid, the enemy aircraft were all in small formations of ten or fewer aircraft, likely to avoid a repeat of the chaotic situation during previous large-scale raids when they were intercepted by Japanese aircraft and fled into the clouds. Their clumsy tactics have now been completely exposed, which suggests that the enemy will adopt a small-formation strategy in the future.</p>
<h3>American Casualties in Luzon Island Operations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Associated Press frontline news, a 14th Headquarters communique from MacArthur stated that total American casualties in Luzon Island operations had reached 9,680 in the five weeks since the start.</p>
<h3>War Results of Japanese Army in Lu Province in January</h3>
<p>Qingdao, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the 13th, Japanese forces in the Shandong area have launched brave operations in the eastern, northern, and southern parts of Lu province against enemy forces of both the Chongqing and Yan'an factions. The combined war results of a certain Japanese unit are as follows: (1) 22 engagements with the Chongqing faction, with an enemy strength of 6,100. The enemy left behind 343 bodies, 39 prisoners captured, 620 hand grenades seized, 109 swords, 210 rifles, 103 units of ammunition, and a large number of other military supplies. (2) 16 engagements with the Yan'an faction, with an enemy strength of 5,700. The enemy left behind 283 bodies, 17 prisoners captured, 270 hand grenades seized, 53 swords, 147 rifles, 665 units of ammunition, and a large number of other military supplies. In addition, since January 5th, enemy airfields and coastal bases have been destroyed, and the enemy's counterattack attempts have been greatly thwarted.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Municipal Government and Others Send Personnel to Investigate Edible Oil in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to ensure a smooth supply of edible oil to Nanjing, the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization Commission has requested that the Ministry of Industry, the Nanjing Municipal Government, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce send personnel to Northern Jiangsu to investigate the area's production, with a view to purchasing and transporting large quantities to Nanjing to meet the needs of the city's residents. It has been learned that the three related organizations have appointed responsible personnel to depart for Northern Jiangsu today (the 16th) to conduct investigations.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-discussing the Three-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>The conference of the three major anti-Axis powers, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, which began at the beginning of this month, was declared over on the 11th. This newspaper's editorial has already made a concise statement regarding the details of this conference, its possible content, and the contradictions and conspiracies among the three countries, and the development of the facts will probably not fall outside the scope of our discussion.</p>
<p>The place where the three heads gathered was Yalta in Crimea, near the Black Sea coast. Roosevelt and Churchill did not hesitate to make another long journey overseas to be enlightened by Stalin, which shows the importance of Stalin's position in the three-way talks. In reality, the Red military power is developing more rapidly and widely than that of Britain and the United States, and its political power has already far exceeded that of Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union's arrogance and Stalin's arrogance are not accidental.</p>
<p>However, although the Three Heads Conference has been declared over, apart from a vague so-called joint declaration issued on the 13th, no specific content has been published. The joint declaration seems to focus on military aspects and how to deal with the German question, but they are still being secretive about these matters. It is claimed that the three countries have agreed on closer joint military plans than before, but they will not be announced until they are implemented. It is also claimed that the three countries have decided on a plan for Germany's unconditional surrender, but it will not be announced until Germany is finally defeated. The joint declaration stated that they want to shorten the war time and coerce Germany to quickly surrender and pay compensation, which shows their anxiety about the further prolongation of the war and their ruthlessness towards Germany. However, as the German external spokesman stated: Germans would rather endure pain and sacrifice completely, and the Yalta communique will instead arouse Germans' psychology of hatred and enmity. Obviously, it is wishful thinking for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to expect Germany to surrender easily and end the war as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is certain that the three heads have discussed international political issues from many aspects. However, they seem to be even more secretive about political issues. This is nothing more than: (1) They have various conspiracies with the goal of sacrificing the smaller countries and must maintain extreme secrecy; (2) They have many contradictions centered on the division of spheres of influence and need to carefully conceal them.</p>
<p>On the issues of Poland and France, the conspiracy of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to control the world and oppress the weak has already been clearly revealed. It is said that the Three Heads Conference has decided to reorganize the Polish government and establish a "Polish National Coalition Government". How to establish the government is entirely to be controlled by foreigners, which is not a thorough internal interference? The de Gaulle regime in France, which relies on British and American support and takes advantage of the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union to grow, has considerable ambitions. The French are still keen on squeezing into the position of a first-class country, but they have been suppressed by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. It is rumored that de Gaulle repeatedly requested to participate in the meeting before the conference, but was always excluded. All of this contains factors that will still make the future international situation turbulent and unstable.</p>
<p>As for the contradictions among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, even if they want to hide them, they are often exposed at any time and anywhere. Before the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill first held talks on the island of Malta, and then flew together to meet Stalin, which also showed the subtle relationship between the three countries. Their contradictions cannot be resolved in a day or two. It is said that an "Anti-Axis Conference" will be held in San Francisco in mid-April, and all anti-Axis countries will be invited to participate. We can still predict that this future meeting will still not achieve anything.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Thamadaw Airfield; Fierce Battles in the Irrawaddy River Basin</h3>

<h3>Minister Wu Talks about Strengthening Combat Power</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The General Affairs Minister of the Manchurian State's Military Department recently spoke on the reallocation of industry among China, Japan, and Manchuria and related issues, stating: The reallocation of industry among China, Japan, and Manchuria must be based on a high degree of comprehensive perspective. Therefore, the Manchurian State's strategy for enhancing its combat power will also increase with this new concept, that is, in addition to undertaking the task of supplying raw materials for the war in the past, it must also work hard in the production of decisive weapons such as aircraft, so that resources can become front-line combat power. Regarding the implementation of the new concept, there are two methods: the establishment of new factories and the relocation of Japanese factories. It is currently being actively handled with the support of the Japanese government. In addition to factory technology for the import and construction of new industries, it is also expected that Japanese entrepreneurs will need to enter Manchuria in the future. To this end, except in special circumstances, efforts will be made to allow outstanding Japanese entrepreneurs to come to Manchuria freely, and like other enterprises in Manchuria, if their enterprises are in danger, the state will be responsible for providing assistance.</p>

<h3>Victory in the Defense at the Vistula Society; Soviet Army Attempts to Encircle Breslau</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: The German army on the Eastern Front has now amassed more troops and launched repeated counteroffensives. The battles in the entire area from Megrogo to Schnieidemühl in the central sector are still in the preparatory stage, involving troop deployments and the struggle for bridgeheads. The Soviet army can only launch further offensives after crossing the Warta River, but has not yet reached that stage. The Red Army is attempting to advance towards Danzig between Camin and Schwetz, aiming to break through the German Vistula defense line. In the past twenty-four hours, the German army has achieved a complete victory in the defensive battles in this area. The Soviet army in Lower Silesia believes it has completed preparations for an offensive, but its operations have not been as smooth as initially expected. General Konev is again attempting to cut off the garrison of Breslau at Steinau in the upper reaches of the Warta River, between Gans and Kostenblut, severing the last line of communication between Breslau and the west. Fierce battles are currently taking place along the route, and the next forty-eight hours will determine whether the goal of isolating Breslau can be achieved. The fighting west of Breslau in the past twenty-four hours has forced General Konev to redeploy his troops. The Soviet army has concentrated a large number of tanks and mechanized infantry in the Liegnitz-Jauer-Neumarkt area, and this deployment has affected the fighting on the Bober River, with parts of the Soviet army apparently withdrawing from that area. After the German army withdrew from Penig, the Soviet army's advance has reached the Queis River at several points, and only localized fighting is taking place in the Sagan area. The Soviet army is currently fiercely attacking the fortress of Glogau, as it directly blocks the motor road from the Warta River to Sagan and Liegnitz, and Cottbus.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: A German military spokesman announced at noon on Wednesday: Sagan in southern Silesia is still firmly held by the German army, and all Soviet attacks have been repelled by the German garrison.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: After the fall of Elbing in East Prussia, the Soviet army has begun to reorganize and replenish its heavily casualties assault units. The Red Army has also dispatched reinforcements to the lower reaches of the Nogat River, and the fighting in various areas of the Königsberg front has eased. The corridor along the coastal highway has been slightly expanded by the German army, and the advance of the Soviet tank army has been blocked in the fierce street fighting east of Stuthenen, where the center of the battle is located.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, citing qualified sources: The Russian Liberation Army is an independent unit, and its commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Vlasov, has the power of discipline and appoints officers according to its military needs. The chief of staff of the army is General Trukhin.</p>
<p>Western Front Offensive Shows Signs of Fatigue</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: The large-scale offensive of the enemy on the Western Front has gradually shown signs of fatigue. The German army is putting up fierce resistance along the 300-kilometer front from Nijmegen to Trier. After breaking through the first line of defense, the Canadian army's attempt to break through the lower reaches of the Rhine River failed. Many British and Canadian troops were cut off and annihilated in this battle. The British Second Army and the US Ninth Army on the Meuse and Roer River front lines are preparing for a major offensive, while the US First and Third Armies are engaged in fierce fighting between the Eifel and Saar Rivers. The right wing of the British and American armies has suffered heavy casualties, and the German army is fighting for every inch of ground, with every crossing point being contested. The fighting in Prüm is extremely fierce, with the bunkers changing hands six times in twelve hours. The US army is attempting to break through the German defense line in the Eifel, and the battle for the fortification on the German-Luxembourg border is extremely fierce. The enemy has launched its fifth major offensive on Aachen in five days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: A German military spokesman pointed out yesterday that the heavy flooding and melting snow in the various areas of the right wing of the Western Front have slowed down the large-scale offensive of the British and American armies against the German positions there. The current weather has turned the areas where the anti-Axis forces intend to launch a major offensive into swamps, and the German counteroffensives have also had a strong effect.</p>
<p>Marshall Inspects Italian Front</p>

<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch: Chongqing Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie released the progress of the Nationalist-Communist negotiations on the 14th, stating in full as follows: The Chongqing-Yan'an negotiations, which have continued for the past two weeks, have finally stalled again. Although Chongqing has continued to make concessions in many ways regarding the negotiations, Yan'an has rejected them. The first concession is to recognize the legal status of Yan'an; the second is to allow representatives from the Yan'an leadership to participate in the Chongqing Military Council; the third is to allow representatives from Yan'an and other parties and factions to participate in the Executive Yuan to form a wartime cabinet-style organization; the fourth is to allow the establishment of a joint committee to review the reorganization and supply issues of the Communist army, with representatives from both Chongqing and Yan'an attending to discuss solutions. In addition, a US military representative will be added to preside over the affairs of the committee. However, Yan'an has rejected the above concessions. At the same time, it has also proposed to Chongqing to convene a research conference of various parties and factions. The Chongqing government, considering the provisional measures for military and political affairs and the future National Assembly, has agreed to convene a meeting of influential figures from Yan'an and other parties and factions, as well as non-partisan individuals. It is reported that Zhou Enlai has returned to Yan'an with the Chongqing proposal for consultation with Yan'an.</p>

<h3>Price Evaluation Council to Convene Deliberation Meeting Today to Approve Prices of Major Commodities</h3>
<p>In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the central government's regulations on price management, has taken emergency measures to strengthen the organizational structure of the existing Municipal Price Evaluation Council. Ten economic experts or impartial businessmen from this city, including Li Quanshi, Li Zufan, and Xu Yuanfang, have been selected as specialized committee members to study the city's market conditions, commodity cost calculations, and commodity types, in order to evaluate prices in a reasonable manner. At the same time, in accordance with the revised regulations of the Municipal Price Evaluation Council, representatives from relevant agencies and organizations in the city or economic experts have been appointed as committee members and councilors.

<h3>Money Exchange Opens Tomorrow; Banks Reopen Today</h3>

The Central Reserve Bank and various commercial banks will resume business as usual today (the 16th) after the Spring Festival holiday.

Members of both the major money exchange houses (remittance exchanges) and the minor money exchange houses (money exchange houses) will report to their respective trade associations at 10:00 AM on that day to be listed.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Paintings Opens Today</h3>
<p>The "Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Paintings" organized by this newspaper will open today (the 16th) at the Chinese Painting Academy, showcasing contemporary painting masterpieces. All sectors are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Electricity Authority Resumes Power Supply; Tram Line 1 Resumes Normal Operation Today</h3>
<p>The city's electricity problem, previously caused by obstacles at the bureau, had temporarily suspended power supply to a small number of areas and the operation of tram lines. However, the electricity authority, in view of the Lunar New Year and the eager hope of all sectors for resumption, has resumed normal power supply to users, and tram lines 1 and 7 have also resumed normal operation. It is understood that tram line 1, which runs on the Bund and North Sichuan Road, will resume normal operation starting today (the 16th).</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Committee to Distribute Winter Clothing; Investigation and Registration Currently Underway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality's 33rd Year Winter Relief Committee, in order to empathize with the difficult times and relieve the poor, is actively preparing for the distribution of winter clothing. A large batch of cotton clothes (including sizes for adults and children, men and women) to be distributed has been produced day and night, and has recently been fully completed. Huang Jingwan, Deputy Director of the Relief Group of the committee, and Feng Xunchen, Deputy Director of the Audit Group, inspected and accepted the clothes at the clothing factory some days ago, and verified that they were in line with the original price. It is understood that the committee is currently mobilizing charity organizations in various districts to investigate and register those who are truly poor and in need of relief, limited to those with no vices. The committee has also printed application forms for registration and entrusted them to charity organizations in the city and countryside for distribution. Anyone wishing to apply should obtain the forms from the designated locations, fill them out in order, and they will only be valid after an investigation confirms the need.</p>
<h3>Southern District to Re-check Household Registrations</h3>
<p>Since taking over the Nanshi Baojia District last year, the Baojia Division of the Municipal Police Bureau has established a Southern District Office. After three months of reorganization, the Southern District Baojia has divided the area into zones and established a Lianbao system that is very complete. It is understood that the Southern District Office will conduct a re-check of household registrations in order to further refine the adjustment of the population.</p>
<h3>Preventing Malpractice in China Railway Must Be Thoroughly Implemented</h3>
<p>The rectification of discipline in China Railway has been underway for more than a year, and is a practical requirement of the entire Chinese population. However, recently, due to the insufficient number of train trips, the issue of train tickets has tended to encourage illegal behavior by China Railway employees. The China Railway authorities have indeed implemented countermeasures to prevent malpractice, but these countermeasures are not thorough enough, and even have an attitude of evading responsibility for this illegal behavior as "force majeure," which is regrettable. Moreover, the conscious or unconscious obstruction of rice procurement work by China Railway employees is particularly criticized by all parties. Because the relevant authorities believe that rice and airplanes and tanks are all weapons for carrying out the Greater East Asia War, they dispatched rice procurement teams and repeatedly requested the China Railway authorities to provide special convenience in purchasing tickets for workers traveling between the interior of Shanghai to buy rice. On the official identity certificate, it was clearly stated: "Please provide convenience regarding transportation and other matters." This was intended to remind China Railway employees to pay attention and to formally issue ticket application forms and reach an understanding with the China Railway authorities that those with application forms should be given priority in purchasing tickets. However, China Railway employees found it difficult to solicit tips from those with special identity certificates and special application forms, so they deliberately did not sell tickets under various pretexts, which hindered rice procurement work.</p>
<p>This fact has proven how China Railway employees use their authority to engage in corruption, which has angered the relevant authorities. The heads of China Railway headquarters and various on-site agencies are almost all Japanese, and they often claim that "illegal behavior is committed by Chinese people, which is unavoidable," which is suspected of shifting responsibility to Chinese people and failing to take full responsibility to resolutely implement rectification work. Recently, criticisms of "Where is the spirit of China Railway?" have been rampant in the market.</p>
<p>The call to promptly report China Railway employees who obstruct rice procurement work and resolutely execute them in the Shanghai Station square is something that the highest leaders of the company should reflect on, promptly implement emergency countermeasures, and also take countermeasures to eliminate the illegal behavior of general ticket sales.</p>
<p>Difficulties When Boarding</p>
<p>Mr. A said: Previously, the Kunshan Rice Association Office urgently needed to allocate procurement funds, so it sent an employee to Jiangsu Office and the relevant guiding authorities to raise about 6,000 yuan, intending to take the express train back to Kunshan. However, the Suzhou station staff deliberately made things difficult and ultimately prevented him from boarding the train. The farmers in Kunshan were waiting for cash payments, and delaying payment even for one day would have a negative impact on the work. Later, fortunately, Japanese soldiers understood that rice work was indeed very important, so he was able to return to Kunshan with the Japanese soldiers on a freight train. This kind of example is countless. Even a female guest who looks like a dancer, as long as she pays, can take the express train, while those with important public affairs are rejected outside the train. Are China Railway employees eating tickets instead of rice?</p>
<p>Application Thrown Back</p>
<p>Mr. B said: I am a procurement worker in Jiaxing. I came to Shanghai to negotiate official business and planned to return to Jiaxing after finishing. I arrived at the ticket office at 4:00 AM with a special application form and waited in line. When tickets were sold at 7:00 AM, the ticket seller looked at the application form and said: Do you want to buy a ticket with this? At that time, the people in front and behind me all bought tickets, but I was the only one who didn't. As a result, I had to wait until the next day to return. I hope that this kind of illegal China Railway employee will be executed by firing squad. (Translated from the Continental News on February 15)</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's "Shanghai Municipal Administration" Column Welcomes Reader Contributions</h3>
<p>This newspaper has recently opened a "Shanghai Municipal Administration" column to publish the authorities' intentions for municipal measures, the demands of the citizens, the suggestions of the citizens for municipal measures, and the demands of the citizens for the authorities, in order to communicate opinions, understand each other, and then work together.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Revises Method for Escorting Cash</h3>
<p>Regarding the transportation of banknotes by merchants and civilians, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that those with more than 100,000 yuan must apply to the ministry for a passport. However, due to the current high cost of living, soaring prices, and increased need for cash, there is naturally more transportation. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has revised the provision in Article 2 of the original method for escorting cash, which required a passport for more than 100,000 yuan, to more than 300,000 yuan to meet the needs. It has been announced and will be implemented from February 16 of this year.</p>
<h3>Baojia Personnel Wear New Armbands</h3>
<p>Regarding the armbands worn by Baojia personnel and all levels of leaders and members of the Self-Defense Corps in various districts under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Bureau, the style has been specified, the designated printing house has been assigned to supervise the production, and the districts are successively receiving them and adding prints for distribution. All old armbands from the various districts in the past, because they were prepared by each district, were of different standards, and even a Lianbao had prepared them individually. If they were not reorganized, there would be many malpractices. Therefore, the Municipal Police Bureau's Baojia Self-Defense Corps Headquarters decided that, starting this month, all old armbands of Baojia and self-defense personnel in the various districts will be prohibited from wearing, and must be collected and sent to the Corps Headquarters for cancellation. At the same time, new armbands will be worn starting from today.</p>

<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Scholarship Fund: "Special Fundraising" Last Four Days</h3>
<p>Ending Around the 20th of This Month, Spanning Eighty Days</p>
<p>This newspaper's "Special Fundraising Team," organized to raise funds for the eighth readers' scholarship fund, has been promoted since December 1st of last year. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life in Shanghai, who have made various efforts, contributing both effort and money, though in different ways, their contributions to aiding impoverished students and reserving talent for the country are completely consistent. In particular, teachers and students from major primary and secondary schools have jointly raised funds and provided particularly generous support. This great spirit of courage to do good is not only admired by all of us at this newspaper, but also deeply appreciated by the 5,000 scholarship recipients, who are moved to tears! The current scholarship work is about to be completed, and approximately 36 million yuan in aid is needed. As of today, 31.2 million yuan in aid has been raised, leaving a shortfall of 4.8 million yuan. It is believed that the proceeds from the upcoming charity bazaar and the benefit performance of "Wealthy Floating Clouds" will be sufficient to cover the shortfall. Therefore, this newspaper has decided that the deadline for the "Special Fundraising" will be the 20th of this month. In these last four days, it is hoped that all parties who have already made contact or are in the process of carrying out fundraising procedures will quickly settle them and send the donations to this office, so that the process can be completed on schedule. Given the urgency of the current situation, this newspaper has decided that the scholarship fund should be managed on a receipts-and-disbursements basis, leaving no donations behind, so as not to cause any inconvenience. We believe that this is a perfect accomplishment, and that the merit of our readers is unparalleled!</p>
<p>Disciples of the Master Wen Collectively Donate to the Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>Yang Fusheng and six other brothers wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, we have heard that our teacher, Master Lan, often used Mencius' words 'Yu thought that if there were any drowning in the world, it was as if he had drowned them; Ji thought that if there were any starving in the world, it was as if he had starved them,' as a lesson. In order to promote this spirit of serving society, we have specially formed the 'Wen's Disciples Rescue Out-of-School Team,' collecting 500,000 yuan in national currency to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, as a token of our humble intentions. We especially hope that fellow disciples of Master Wen will follow suit and contribute, hoping to encourage others. We are now presenting the funds, along with a list of names, and hope you will consider it."</p>
<h3>Song of Spring: Benefit Performance Imminent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Song and Music Society wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir: The Society intends to hold a benefit performance of the new-style musical song and dance drama 'Song of Spring' at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:00 PM on February 24th and 25th to support your newspaper's reader scholarship fund. The proceeds from the ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be donated entirely to the scholarship fund. We believe your newspaper will be happy to support this. The drama includes stage design, makeup, performance, symphony orchestra accompaniment, Sun Jinshen, Liu Yiling, Mao Tiemin, and a dance ensemble choir participating in the singing, Huang Yongxi serving as conductor, and Chen Zhong and Zheng Chuanjian designing and choreographing the dances. This is a new sprout emerging in the spring. We only hope that more " " people will come to cherish and nurture it, so that it can bloom new flowers in our country's barren artistic field.</p>
<p>APC Candy's New Year's Charity</p>
<p>APC Candy Company's various hard and soft candies, biscuits, and cakes are suitable for all ages. To support the charity sale organized by the two newspapers and the YMCA/YWCA on February 15th and 16th, a large batch of candies will be supplied at the "Hujiang Store" in the market (Xue Gengtang). We hope that members of society will take advantage of their spare time during the New Year greetings to visit the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge and purchase the company's various candies, both helping students and getting high-quality candies, a win-win situation. Don't miss the opportunity.</p>
