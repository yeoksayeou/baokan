<p>菲律賓基地十三日中央社電　敵美軍於仁牙因灣卸下步兵兩師，戰車一師團，目下於登陸地點急於擴大橋頭堡，似欲極力增强登陸兵力。十一日拂曉，在日海空軍之邀擊中，使第三組運輸船團侵入仁牙因灣，敵軍爲掩護仁牙因灣內之敵運輸船團，復以特設空母若干艘爲主幹之小規模機動部隊，遊弋於仁牙因灣西部，一方在台灣東方海而爲搗亂日軍後方補給基地。敵機動部隊於九日前後突分出一部向西南前進，狀似調向南中國海方面，此批敵機動部隊，企圖避免日軍內棧海空軍之邀擊。於仁牙因灣岸登陸之敵軍，九日以來竭力維持灣岸一部之橋頭堡，刻下敵之陸上作戰漸次進入正式之階段，於仁牙因灣登陸之敵軍左翼，逐次南下，而向阿古諾河南岸之阿基拉爾前進，其目標似在到達阿古諾河畔，敵方除使用火焰放射器外，尚使用火箭砲，更有若干重砲遷往第一　，日軍正充滿鬥志，待機擊碎敵軍，呂宋島中央平原北部陸上，行將展開一大決戰。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　敵美軍九日最於仁牙因灣南岸之聖法比安中達訂旁等地區强行登陸後，更當日方陸空之猛烈攻擊，九·十兩日繼續運送兵員之資材登陸，目下該方面登陸之敵軍兵力，擁有步兵二師團及具有戰車一百輛戰車部隊一師團內外，彼等刻正於沿岸一帶積極建設橋頭堡，除聖法比安正面以戰車爲主幹之一部隊稍有進展外，全體尚無顯著進展。仁牙因聲正面敵方登陸之地點，全係惡質之潮濕地帶，致防碍敵方之作戰行動，然敵方仍繼續增强其登陸部隊之兵力，敵軍第三船團亦正續向仁牙因灣航行中。同時，日陸上精銳部隊，對此登陸敵軍亦不斷予以攻擊，且日富嶽，神風等陸海軍特攻隊及陸軍機結成特攻隊，連日出動猛炸仁牙因灣內之敵艦船，日機大多數全係去而不還者，九·十兩日之戰果，日大本營十二日已予發表。敵軍之侵襲仁牙因灣作戰，今已蒙受莫大損失。</p>

<h3 id="c8">周學昌市長談　首都民生　本報特派記者 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 澹明</p>
<p>到南京已經一個多禮拜了，看到首都物價的變動，不由不注意到市府行政。因此在一月五日早晨，驅車到中山北路市政府去訪問市長周學昌氏。</p>
<p>周市長是河北保定人，事變前會在敎育界政界中工作多年，極有聲譽，曾任北京市敎育局長及陝西省敎育廳長等職，是個敢說敢爲的政治家。後來奉命考察東南戰區，因爲不滿當時浙贛兩省政治黑暗的情形，毅然脫離渝政權。適逢汪故主席倡導和運，經周佛海先生之邀，參加了和運，擔任立法院秘書長之職。是時渝方還沒知道，據說尚發表周氏爲浙贛邊區行政督察處副主任之職。記者景仰已久，可是還沒見過。</p>
<p>周氏見面就說：「責社陳社長在事變前見過一面，我本月底到上海去，定和他暢談一番。」</p>
<p>物資流通</p>
<p>「市長常到上海去嗎？」記者問：「通常我很少到上海去，」他回答我：「以前去一次不過化三萬或四萬塊錢，現在恐非數十萬不辦了！」</p>
<p>「提到了現在的生活高漲，」記者追問下去：『倒要請敎目都一般的民生和經濟情形。』</p>
<p>「讓我來說個大概吧』市長凝思了一會說：我到這裏來做市長，抱定以民生爲重。所以這裏的一切物資除軍用與實業部所統制者外，一概不加限制，完全讓其洗通。因此這裏的物價，雖然近來也漸在上昇，可是比較蘇州和上海要便宜得多。』　『那末』我再問：『前於食米的情形如何？』</p>
<p>『提至負米，也比他處要好，』他抽一口烟說：『這裏的食米靠江寗，江浦，溧水，六合和句容六縣供給，這六個縣又都在軍米區之外，所以一般市民所需絕對沒有問題』</p>
<p>配給制度</p>
<p>『每市民配給的數量如何？』記者</p>
<p>問：</p>
<p>『每人每日四合，』市長接下來說：『可說較上海爲佳，而且市府把由上海配對的望一切日用品，絲毫不差地配給一般市民，不像有些地方沒有配給制度，反將之拋向黑市取和。』</p>
<p>「不過，」市長停了停又說：「上海配發物資時，有時不十分平等，譬如食糖一項，上海已配到十七期，而京市還只有配到第八期，甚到第八期的配價還和現在十七期相同。大概他們誤會南京也和其它地方相同，沒有實施挨戶配給的制度吧！』</p>
<p>「我現在把所有的物資完全配給於市民，」周氏滔滔不絕地說：「譬如紙烟，上海沒有戶口配給，可是這裏也和其它日用品一樣配給。盟邦經濟顧問都認爲毋需，我還要要配給，因爲這樣才可以壓平外面的黑市！」</p>
<p>「市長能够用這種精神整理經濟，」記者稅：「眞是造福京市居民不淺。」</p>
<p>「談不到造福，」市長稅：「無論怎樣，我只要在任一天，市民的生活總得負責。所以這幾天食米假定再漲下去，配給米到月底不發放，我準備把食米的洗通限制加以開放</p>
<p>「現在京市居民關於食米移動的限制如何！」記者間。</p>
<p>「也和上海一樣是一斗」他回答。</p>
<p>盟邦協力</p>
<p>「像你所說的種種經濟措施，」記者又問：」不曉得盟邦的協力如何？」</p>
<p>「那倒不成問題，」市長馬上回答：「他們很講信用，只要做地方官的不想假公濟私，他們的援助是立至的。在這種情狀下，對中日商人是一般的。譬如爲了節電，有幾家借着日商牌子的店家不聽命令，日本領署警察當局得到通知後立即去封。」</p>
<p>「市長，」我再換一個話題：「你對近來的時局有何感想？」</p>
<p>「無諭怎樣，」局氏流露着笑容說，「我總覺得日本是我們的眞正友人，英美那種帝國主義式的作風是應該反對的。」</p>
<p>「小磯首相在今天報上曾說敵方有以決戰重心移到太平洋的形勢，」記者再問：「不知市長對我一國的前途作何感想？」</p>
<p>周氏設：「是嗎？如果戰事太長了，我國的民生眞是不了啊。」</p>
<p>謂到這裏，已快十二點了，當記者辭別時，承周市長告訴了私人電話，希望再去暢談，我想這實在是一位對新聞記者頂優禮有加的市長了！</p>

<p>— 人傑</p>
<p>上海木是一個畸形發展的都市，雖然在中國，是首屈一指的大都市，是華中工商業集中的地方，但它與世界上其他正常發展的都市不同，牠的繁榮，主要的並不是寄託在與中國內地更不是與附近農村的聯　上，而是寄託在對外的國際貿易上。無論是商品，原料，資本，技術，都在這種不正常狀態下發展起來。這在一方面說明了這一「國際」都市的矛盾性格，另一方面也說明了解決這種都市柿種問題之困難。</p>
<p>近年海運旣斷，因陸交通亦受阻滯，而人口則激增，生活資料的生產與幟入日趨减少，而生活資料的消耗却日益增加，於是便給奸商以可乘之機，便成爲一切暴利懼取者活動的溫床。民生的困苦，自必影響到社會治安。大東亞戰爭後，保甲組織的强化，對治安的維持有着相當的貢獻，但整個問題並不能得到適當解決。無論從民生與治安而言，「增加生產」是必要的急務；但道種具體的方策，收效須經相當時日，而現在的民生問題及其所引起的影饗已到了相富嚴重的地步，所以，除了百年大計之外，尚需要毅然決然的緊急對策。</p>
<p>自然，民生問題的澈底解決，有待於大東亞戰爭的勝利，至少也有待於盲目抗戰的中止，可是中國民衆是最善良也是最現實的：所要求的只是最低限度的生存條件，對政治的興趣本來不高。當他的最低限度的生存要求都不能滿足的時候，對一切「善政」也鼓不起熱情，口雖不言，而心下猶豫。所以當前的現實正是：嚴重的民生困難足以影響到大東亞戰爭，足以影響到和平區建設的成敗，足以影響到民心之向背，而且影響到行政機構之健全，影響到行政效能之發揮，影響到社會各業許多平時應有的，而戰時尤需有的正軌。最明顯的莫過於交通事業，其他各公共事業亦都有影響，以致當局的各種設施，雖然都經過各級機關愼密的研討，然而一付實行，往往不能達到預期的効果，甚至時常得到相反的，不必要的不良影饗。近傳當局有澈底改善配給制度之議，有重點配給的計劃，以此來改善民生，平抑物價，澄淸吏治，也未始不是因時制宜的打算，然而畸形的人口集中，生產者减少，消費者增加的癥結如不能切實解決，那麼效能還是有限。因爲經濟問題社會問題本不能單靠分配來解決，在現在決戰時期，更要軍需民需雙方兼顧，在一時難以解決增產問題的時候，配給制度固應改善，然而如不能解決供應問題，暴利者與勒索者仍有寄生的餘地，所以無論如何其效能總有限度。現在工商界裁員現象，有逐漸普遍的趨勢，在工商界固亦有其不得已的苦衷，但將更使生產者减少，消費者增加的矛盾益形尖銳，所以，平抑物價，增加生產，徵治貪污。澈查囤積，重點配給……之外，尚須有積極的人口疏散。</p>
<p>上海的人口原多自盤村破產而來，戰後又多因各地治安不良而來，這正說明了何以在生活水準已到全國範圍內最高峯的上海市民，還沒有普遍疏散的原因，也就是說明了個別疏散與自動還鄕的困難。所以疏散人口，必須採取有計劃的步驟，以團體疏散爲主，個別疏散爲輔；積極的寓生產建設於疏散工作，當局應採取誘導，鼓勵，援助的辦法，旣不只是簡單的任其自動還鄕，也不只徒尚宣傳或是以行政方法强迫疏散。</p>
<p>總括起來，疏散工作的困難，主要是：（一）疏散後無以謀生，（二）各鄕治安不良，（三）交通上的種種困難以及不良軍警勒索之普遍，（四）由於市民的一貫荀安的心理，看不到即將到來的嚴重局面，因而得過且過。</p>
<p>針對以上數點，我們建議辦法數點：（一）將如有疏散必要之企業，機關，團體，學校先行疏散，中心一變，自然就影響到整個市民的動向。同時也就附帶產生出繁榮各地的作用。（二）由當局提倡督導，將各業所裁員工，由各同業公會，同鄕會等民衆團體策動，按各種可能條件，分頭找適當目的地，組織生產事業，或開墾，或貿易，或辦小規模工廠或手工業工廠，各級政府給於應有之實惠便利。（三）提倡還鄕運動，在交通上應絕對予以便利，由政府責成交通機關保障行李運輸之安全。各種手續務求簡單。（四）疏散人口應成爲主要政策之一，一變過去因循茍且的弊病，各級政府對各金業團體之此種工作應與以保障與援助，以此成爲公務員成績老核的重要標準，如果利用時艱荼毒人民者嚴厲論罪。（五）輿諭界，慈善團體，福利組織，同鄕會等，及宣傳機關，即開始研究提倡此一工作及其具號的實施方案，使疏散成爲民衆自願的積極的迎動。</p>
<p>在決戰年的今年，敵方擾亂後方人心的蠶動企圖，自屬可能，希望各界對人口疏散問題幸勿等閒視之。</p>

<h3 id="c33">特別攻擊隊　薰空挺隊的壯績 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>終於幹起來啦！在敵地降陸而衝殺進去，如果可能，更趁着黑夜飛降敵方的飛行塲，炸燬敵機，這種壯烈的所謂人間美，到底將不可能的戰術的夢實現了。這個部隊，這個可怖的部隊，豪怏無比的部隊，大胆無敵的部隊，就是特別攻擊隊黨空挺隊。這是戰史上尙未見過的在敵地着陸的肉搏隊。不是夜夢　不是想像。在敵機空襲非常厲害的〇〇基地，記者們曾和這支肉搏隊共同起臥。現在，記者們懷着滿腔感慨，在搖曳不定的椰十油燈的燈光下，寫下了這蕭關於薰空挺隊的報吿。</p>
<p>破壞敵機　一架不剩</p>
<p>「破壞飛機的道理，正和打爲一樣。在天上髙飛的鳥，無論是怎樣一等二的射擊名手，也難隻隻打下來。可是，當鳥兒歸巢以後，捉起來便容易得多了。飛機也是相彷的，在空中擊墜它，並不容易。要想大量被壞飛機，只有在飛行塲上。」由於這個航空戰略的理外的大原理，這支大胆已極的敵地　陸炸毀敵機隊便編組成功了。他們不像降落傘部薩那樣在無人的平原降陸，他們是乘着大型運輸機在敵方飛行塲中央降陸，一待飛機着陸，就輕捷地跳下米，只要隊長的命令一下，便猿猴般撲向滑走路兩側的敵機，或掩蔽所裏的敵機，將隨身所帶的强烈炸藥裝在敵機的要緊地方，一架又一架，迅速敏捷，於是飛行塲上的敵禨就在剎那間炸毀乾凈，一架不剩。這眞是空前的大奇製部隊。</p>
<p>暗夜視物　行走如風</p>
<p>肅空挺隊是由各部隊精造出來的日軍勇士及台灣出身的特別志願兵組成的，隊員都是血氣方盛的靑年，平均年齡是廿四歲。他們生長在太陽灼熱。山獄嵯峨。平原靑翠的台灣，從幼時起就養成了尅勝敵人的堅强鬥志。他們最擅於　山密林中行動，不怕炎暑，好勇鬥狠，以能參加此戰爲無上的快樂。他們更有一項本領，便是能够黑夜視物。其夜間視力的强大，眞正驚人！在所謂黑得伸手不見五指的暗夜，他們普通可以綽綽有餘地這到三十米遠，如果蹲下來用特有的識別法觀　，則可　到五十米六十米，熟練者且能判別百米之處的人是誰。</p>
<p>不怕炎熱，暗夜視物，行走如風，這些都是最宜於黑夜在敵地着陸的奇襲隊的。至於攻擊精神的旺盛，尤非言語所能形容，每個隊員，無不具有盤腸大戰的精神。而且規律嚴整，動作機　，無不情　　爲國家奉獻生命。</p>
<p>特別攻擊隊長中重男中尉曾對記者們談過他部下的事情，大意如左：</p>
<p>有時，他們的行爲反可做我們的模範。他們非常尊敬內地的人，所以我們不能做沒意義的事。前幾日，本隊寄宿在菲律賓人的屋子裏，隊員在打掃屋子的時候，發見有不少蔬菜遺忘在廊下，立刻將它送到搬走了的菲人家裏去。菲律賓人本來沒有歸還遺物的風習，所以對此又驚又喜，感激不已，一定要將豬肉永果等送隊員做酬報。</p>
<p>寳刀一柄　斬殺敵人</p>
<p>「全體隊員都以能做日本國民自誇，每人都有一柄義勇刀。此刀是許可他們佩戴的。這種祖上傳下來的刀，用法極爲巧妙。刀身長僅二尺不到，但衝入敵陣後，必能斬倒數兵。他們都會這種必殺的刀法。」</p>
<p>足令美兵喪　的黨空挺隊，雖然是由各部隊　拔出來的幹部人材及台雙出身的兵士組成，但並不是最近急就的，從過去〇月起就已開始猛烈訓練，一直待機到今日。專門　練是在夜間施行的。記者們曾有機會參觀這種嚴格的夜間訓練數次，其中尤以這次出擊前夜的訓練最爲逼眞猛烈。</p>
<p>最後一次　夜間訓練</p>
<p>是夜，記者們得到隊長的許可，預備將訓練的情形報道後方，所以在漆黑的暗夜，用手電筒照射施行夜間訓練的飛行塲的滑走路附近。啊，有啦，有啦！那不是運輸隊員的大型機嗎？訓練已經開始了！</p>
<p>大型機的門，無聲地打開。現在是假定在敵軍飛行塲降陸的一瞬。隊長首先跳下來，胸　白帶，作斜十字形；是中隊長，接着，是小隊長須冰少尉，也綁白帶。其後魚貫地跳下來的隊員，胸前掛着每枚可以炸毀敵機一架的强烈炸彈，背上負着足供〇日吃用的　糧，　　　着槍刺及其　傳的利刃。有幾個士兵則在右手提着　機關槍取小槍。</p>
<p>一跳下來，隊長即向約五十米處猛然跑去，隊員相繼追隨隊長。隊長用壓低的聲音傳達命令，指定目標。攻擊開始了。只見迅速奔跑的影子，隊員們手裏拿着炸藥，分頭向假想敵機跑去，跳上機　，裝好炸藥，然後像猴子般竄下來，繼續攻擊其次的敵機。</p>
<p>一切都無聲音，甚至連脚步聲也是留心的。突然，後方發出了嘩的一聲喊。於是部隊假定被敵軍發見後應有的行動訓練開始了。一羣像阿修羅般衝入敵陣，一羣乘隙撲向敵機。攻擊終了，全體皆向預先指定的目標地點疾走，像猿猴一般穿越叢林，基地報吿歸返戰果。（譯自十二月四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c34">菲島戰事重心 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>敵美在明多羅島登陸的最大目的，在於發立强有力的航空根據地。桑霍塞附近戰前有飛機塲一處，現敵方正以此爲中心，另行趕造幾個飛機塲，以圖集結大型機和戰鬥機。敵美在雷伊泰島雖受重大損害，但是仍在奧爾莫克南方展開新的上陸戰，採取攻勢，另以繩有力的艦隊與運輸船團，進窺明多羅島。由此以觀，敵美恃其物量之豐，今後在新的地點上陸，不無可能。</p>
<p>雷伊泰島地位重要</p>
<p>雷伊島的地上戰鬥，極爲激烈，敵美正在各處展開攻勢。另方面，更圖鞏固其明多羅島的地位。這種戰略的安排，顯然謀蹈間乘隙，擴大突破口。由於日本今後集中戰力，菲島戰事有更加激烈的可能，前途也不能過份樂觀；但敵方這種戰術是否眞能發揮力量，則須視今後戰局推移而定。</p>
<p>我們冷靜地判斷：敵軍僅爲了維持此種形態，不恤重大犧牲，可知菲鳥戰局的全盤形勢，贊未必有利美國。而且敵美兵力分散，日軍反有可乘之機。敵軍在明多羅島上陸，並不是敵美在菲島作戰中的預定步驟，而是爲了雷伊泰戰事膠着而起的意外作戰。即美國國內，也認此舉極爲冒險，前途尙難測度。爲謀打開雷伊泰戰局而不得不有所舉動的麥克沃塞，在無可奈何之下，不顯一切，衝入了明多羅島。</p>
<p>雷伊泰戰事的膠着，對於敵軍實出意外。由於塞班島的經騐，敵美以爲憑其海上勢力及其豐饒的軍需品，可以一舉而下，在短時期內結束戰事，建立席捲菲島的基地，豈知上陸以來二個月中，他的最大目的建立陸上航空根據地，也不能達到，反而喪失最初奪得的布羅因及桑巴勃洛機塲。而特勒）機塲也因日軍反擊，不堪使用，迄今只有塔克羅班機場一處，擁有小型機四五十架而已。</p>
<p>飛機生產更形重要</p>
<p>敵美的作戰目的，目下顯已失敗。摩洛泰島日軍陸上部隊的衝殺，台灣菲島海面敵美的損害，以及神風特攻隊的拼撞等，對敵軍都是意外的障碍，這是雷伊泰戰事膠着的最大原因。今後霄伊泰的地上戰鬥，敵軍縱有若干成就，但與敵軍使雷伊泰島基地化的最後目標，並無關係，對於敵軍，徒然消耗。明多羅島的登陸，乃是敵美焦慮失望之餘的冒險舉動。其補給綫旣很長大，如果日本航空部隊還健在，目不能任其橫行。因此，我們不可爲明多羅島的戰事所惑，而須注意雷伊泰戰局的推移。此戰的最大目的，在於擊破雷伊泰島上的敵軍，雷伊泰的勝利就是菲島作戰的勝利。明多羅島僅爲日軍包圍中的孤兒，極易解決。問題是：即在雷伊泰方面尙難認爲充分的航空戰力，現在却須分出一部分來對付明多羅島。因此，飛機的生產和補充，倍形重要，亟須後方生產陣營加緊努力。（譯自十二月二十二日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c35">日本海軍　砲術學校一 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>日本□□海軍砲術學校，是大量養成日軍陸戰及防空的少壯指揮官的機關。它疋如鍛鍊精鋼的工廠，在嚴格的訓練下，造成了無數軍事人材。養成航空決戰，艦隊決戰中的幹練靑年士官候補生，十分急需；而加强陸戰防空兵力，擊退敵軍，驅逐敵機，更是要務。因此，養成陸戰防空的靑年指揮官的□□砲術學校，訓練的特點著重在訓育，全校學生均在嚴格的訓練中養成必死必殺的精神。學生中，有許多是文科法科出身的，可是他們的眼瞳中清澄如晶，不含絲毫自我雜念，一受到崇高的命令，立即一致行動。在僅僅若干月後，不論那一張險，都看不出學生的形跡，而變爲優良的海軍軍人。</p>
<p>防空演習</p>
<p>當海濱正在展開敵前上陸及水際邀擊的猛烈訓練時，在南邊禿山的一隅亦已開始髙射砲的操法訓練。巨大的髙射砲周圍，預備生們各就配置。「對空戰鬥！」「左進格拉曼，髙度○○，射擊！」號令一迎串，預備生的身體和機械一樣，又迅速而又正確地地行動。轟隆一聲，巨砲向天怒吼，立即打開裝塡架，一個拔彈莢，一個裝砲彈，一顆新的砲彈滑進了砲膛。一點沒遲滯，一點無參差，像上了油的機械般動作着。</p>
<p>「什麼？已經乏力嗎？」</p>
<p>「不。」含怒似地回答。多明快的聲音！</p>
<p>一分鐘發射□□公重的砲彈○○顆的高射砲，只要□人就可操縱。而且沒有交替的預備員，因爲在前綫砲手即使只剩最後一人，也得單獨裝砲彈開砲，所以此地的對空戰鬥也沒有交替員，訓練旣嚴格又劇烈，以期將來縱然處在那樣不利的環境中也能斷然繼續從事必墜敵機的戰鬥。</p>
<p>精神訓練</p>
<p>這樣，預備生等在這種嚴格的訓練中，孜孜不倦地學習槍砲的各種操法，探照燈及照空燈的操法，對戰車戰法，飛機的識別，及指揮法等。與防空戰鬥的訓練同時，黑夜並作密林内的戰鬥訓線及特殊的水際戰鬥等。正如良好的吸水紙一樣，從各個角度學取陸戰的實際訓練。這期間，並陶冶其人格，使具日本海軍軍人應有的氣質。從靈肉兩方面將每個預備生鍛成沒有瑕疵的海的大丈夫。陸戰防空的指揮官，正如沒有絲毫凹凸的日本刀。</p>
<p>在潮聲隱隱的靜夜，記者於自修時間中詢問預備生們，間他們現在的心境如何，以及對於後繼續者的希望如何。</p>
<p>「最要緊是捨粟自我。希望後輩也如此。」靑木宗也君（法大法學部出身）答道。</p>
<p>「神風特攻隊壯烈的奮戰，我們大家都很感動。我們也熱烈希望在陸戰防空的戰鬥上追隨神風隊。並願以後的人頑健，繼續來做預備生。」髙橋政一君（東大法科出身）。</p>
<p>「直接衝殺敵兵的喜悅，是無上的。後輩各位，只要有熱情和意氣，就可幹得很好。從前我對生死觀尙不明白，自已做人的方針也難決定，到了此地以後，心中豁然，覺得爲了祖國而死，不算什麼。」三浦保君（九大法科出身）。</p>
<p>其他的答案，也沒有不足表明忠誠純一留芳萬世的心境。</p>
<p>實戰經驗</p>
<p>至於鍛練這批純一無垢的靑年的敎官們，也都年紀很輕，從廿二歲到三十歲止，全是該校預備生出身的士官。其中如S少佐是所羅門戰役餘生的K中尉·E少尉·F少尉等也差不多全有在新幾內亞·新喬治亞·菲律賓或北方作戰的經騐。</p>
<p>K中尉對記者說：「預備學生及生徒，起初都以激昂的心情入校。他們的知識和敎養是有的，但缺少實行力，所以短期問內內心甚感苦痛。可是，經過嚴格訓練以後，他們便沒有學生的觀念，一切都忘記自我。我以爲陸戰防空是基本的戰鬥，正如醃菜沒有壓菜石一樣不行，但有了它也看不出什麽顯明的效用。總之，有了陸戰防空，能建立海空的戰果。』（昆特派員）（譯自十二月二日每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 任淑芳</p>
<p>星期日，在我的生活中該是個唯一可以鬆口氣的日子，胡亂地在一家麵館裏吃了碗麵，心裏惦記着一星期沒有這見的依蘋，做什麽也沒有心思回到家裏，這間不能再小的亭子間，堆滿着各種日用東西，我也懶得去整理一下，倚在床上無聊地燃起隻烟，屋子門開了，進來的是依蘋。</p>
<p>我一骨碌站起來丢了捲烟，初冬的陽光淡淡的射進來，我注視着依蘋被陽光吻着的金絲般的捲髪，她用一種熟悉的姿態，拿手拉一下頭髮，躱着我的眼光，慢慢地爲我整理着桌上亂七八糟的東西。</p>
<p>蕩馬路是我們每星期的功課，今天也不能例外，一出門轉了幾條馬路，已經到了靜安寺路，這條最適宜散步的馬路，我們互相談着關於職業上的情况，從前我們最愛談吃的，玩的，現在因爲我已成了經濟戰綫上的失敗者，就怕提到錢，依蘋也知道我手頭上拮据得可以。也就避免談論這些奢費的事，慢慢地我們談到了天氣。從天氣談到衣服，依蘋吿訴我她想做一件長的呢大衣，最好顏色是藏胥，樣子看上去要大方，價錢又不要太貴，本來我們是一問一答地談着，現在我沉默了，店家櫉窗上貼着賤價的廣吿，模特兒換上了初冬的新裝，呈現着優美的姿態，吸引着行人們對她們擠眉弄眼；搖頭嘆息，終於依蘋也歆羨地在一家時裝公司門口停住了脚，櫉窗裏，正是一件藏靑色的大衣，棵子質料據依蘋說都正合她的理想，大衣上標着白底紅字的價目是一萬六千元，依蘋喜悅地徵求我的意見，我袛得勉强地點了一下頭，心裏漸漸地不受用起來。我恨我自已，恨這時裝公司，更恨這世界，經過十分鐘的留戀，依蘋醒悟到她沒有力量來買這大衣，又沉默地拖着我向前走去，她是爲了不能得到心愛的東西而失望，我是爲了不能滿足心愛的人的慾望而難受。</p>
<p>在長久的緘默後，依蘋嘆息着說：「這一輩子也許永遠穿不起大衣了！」我突然光起火來，覺得她這句話，帶着極大的侮辱性，我冷笑着說：「祗怪你瞎了眼看中了我這窮光蛋」，更說不出第二句話，我轉身就走，盡管依蘋不斷地尖着喉嚨喊我，我頭也不回，一口氣奔到家裏。</p>
<p>三年前，我大學畢了樂，又在銀行裏找着一個位子，當年我就和依蘋訂了婚，那時，我充滿着少年得志的氣慨，學校畢業了，職業找着了，戀愛成功了，還有什麽可說的。</p>
<p>剛踏進社會，滿懷着希望，自恃我有個光明的將來，父母是早死了，留給我雖不算多，但也很可觀的家產，我是在我多年守寡的姑母懷抱裏長成的，她像母親一樣的愛我，多年來我在上海念書，她從未斷我的錢，盡量地給我花用，鄕下有好些田地，一般人想起來是吃着不盡的了，一面我努力求學，檢束我的身心，一面我遠驕傲着，我有這麽些財產，假使我能有一個相富的職業，再加上這些家產作後盾，那我的前途是很樂觀的，我就這麽深深相信着自己。</p>
<p>依蘋也是沒有父母的，住在哥哥家裏，雖然她嫂嫂不怎麽待她好，哥哥確是很愛她的，於是我們這一對孤兒相愛着，希望能共同創一個光明的將來，起先人產是很快樂的，依蘋在一家學校裏執敎鞭，我們相約各人努力事業，省吃儉用，預算三年後大家可以積下一筆錢，作我們結婚的費用。一年很快的過去了！我漸漸地感到一種經濟的威脅，因爲交通不便的緣故，家鄕的錢總是來得很遲，在這種情形下，我祗得用薪水來維持生活。物價高速度的上漲，我竭力地追趕蕭，但結果總落在牠後面。今年以來據姑母的來信說，家鄕正在鬧旱災，田裏顆粒無收，鄕下的生活也很困苦，更沒有錢寄出來。我接到這封信背脊上像是給誰重重地搥了一下，一種恐懼，在心中增長起來。加上近來的生活程度，更逼得我透不過氣來。我曾聽朋友的勸吿，去跑股票市塲，但是當我看見黑板上價格的上下竄降，人們頭上的汗，和嘶啞的呌喊聲，我頽然離開了那裏。我想在道種地方我準會得心臟病的，更沒有膽量去做投機，於是就這麽一天天地窮了下來。</p>
<p>男人好像有一種天性，就是爲女人用錢，那怕自己再窮些，錢來得再不容易來些，在女人面前一定要裝着「一擲千金，奄無吝嗇」的樣子。假使偶然女人拿出錢來，男人就覺得不樂意，甚而覺得是一種侮辱和蔑視。我在依蘋面前也極力裝着毫不在乎的樣子，聰明的依蘋早已知道我有這種隱痛，可是她不願意說破，生怕損了我的自尊心。</p>
<p>她常常偸偸地爲我添置各種吃用的東西，極力避免使我感到窮困和不愉快，而她自己雖有她哥哥供給她生活，但也沒有多錢積下來，她從沒有爲了窮而埋怨過我一句，我不曾爲了沒錢用而在她面前訴苦，我們都是矜持而諒解的。</p>
<p>和依蘋鬧了繁扭，我整整地哭了一夜，新愁舊恨都湧上心頭。錢，都是爲了錢，在床上輾轉了一夜，天亮時再也起不起來，昏昏地睡着了，醒來已近中午，竟這麽地病了起來，我孤零零地睡着，沒有一偭人來間我，現在我渴望着依蘋來，我願意認錯，在她面前悔過。</p>
<p>下午，我的頭像炸開來一樣，嘴乾得像什麽似的，想掙扎起來倒口水喝，頭暈得站不起來，又昏昏地倒在床上，恍恍惚惚又睡着了去。在朦朧中，仿彿有人在我床前走動，睜開眼來，正是我苦思着的依蘋。我心裏一陣難受，竟咻咻地哭起來。她撫着我的額，替我拭眼淚，我想向她道歉，可是一句話也說不上來，祇是不住的抽噎。她倒了杯水給我喝，又去買了粥和菜，用湯匙餵我吃，她說：「我知道你爲了不肯放棄這種虛榮心，而痛苦着，今年以來你脾氣變得這麼壞，因爲今年是我們預的結婚的一年。你沒有錢，又不肯對我說，其實我早知道了！」她略略停了一會，去扭亮了電體。</p>
<p>「在這年頭，芷不知有多少靑年人，在心理矛盾下度着痛苦的生活，但是有錢並不能代表成功，也許爲了錢他們造下孽，而讓他們的子孫去忍受惡果。女人似乎大多是愛錢的，但也不能說每個女人都愛錢，儘管目前是個錢的世界，我也想在物質方面講究些，但一想到生活的威脅，錢來得不容易，我就立刻打消了那些念頭，起先心裏總有些難過。再想到貧窮的苦力們，凍餓的乞丐們，我立刻豁然了。結果還是是非心戰勝了虛榮心。第一次的三年計劃就算失敗了。還有第二次的三年計劃，我們都這麼年靑，再遲三年結婚也無妨。記着吧，人生是要奮鬥出來的！」</p>
<p>依蘋服侍我吃下了粥，說明天再來看我就回去了，剩下空虛的屋子和空虛的我。</p>
<p>三年前，我曾有一個幻想，就是我想賺很多的錢把依蘋打扮成一個髙貴的婦人。當我們挽着手進出的時候，要讓別人向我們投射着驚羨着的眼光。</p>
<p>今天，忽然又想起這件事，我苦笑了！但是，我想還有三年哪！</p>

<p>我開始對雪感到厭恨了，幾次我試探地向一片軟綿綿的白雪踏下去，幾次我也被那片雪下面的汚水濺滿了鞋子。</p>
<p>人們知道說雪是純　美麗的，可是只看到了表面。</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>因此，我比較喜歡歡「雨夾雪」。</p>
<p>雨雪誠然在美觀上比不上乾雪，但却是一面下一面融解，一切都依然看得淸，不會給行路人上當的。</p>
<p>於是我想到歌頌雪美麗的，一定是空口說白話的唱高調者吧！</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>這兒又是一件關於雪的罪狀。</p>
<p>在雪地裏有着比較髙起的一塊，一脚踏過去，却發現是個蒲包，裏面有個被棄的嬰孩。</p>
<p>我感到一陣戰慄。雪原是遮蓋一切罪惡的。</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>有個孩子跌在雪裏，想去扶他，自己却幾乎滑了一交。</p>
<p>『好人做不得』。S在旁邊說。</p>
<p>『如果這樣也算好人，我寗願多　幾交』。我說</p>
<p>然而世上幾乎連這種好人也沒有。</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>我和孩子們忙着在天井裏堆雪人。</p>
<p>「有什麼堆頭？」一個孩子飽經世故地說：「到明天太陽一出，馬上就烊光，白弄的。」</p>
<p>於是我爲孩子們設了一個眞理。</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>晚上，雪花還是沒有停。街燈陰慘慘地。</p>
<p>「風雨夜歸人」我親。</p>
<p>我們於是想到那個寂寞的倦遊者魏蓮生，風雪裏的夜歸人。沉默着，聽脚踏在雪上的沙沙的聲音。</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>L是從南洋來的，沒見過雪。</p>
<p>「明天我一定找人拍幾張照相，我從來沒見過這麽大的雪。」</p>
<p>「可憐的人」，我想：「如果你看到北方的多天的時候，看到那一大片冰天雪地的時候，你將會怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>「你想明天還會下麼？」</p>
<p>「不會，」我望了望灰黯的天，</p>
<p>說實話，我眞不希望它再下，爲了我對雪本沒好有惑。</p>
<p>希望明天有個好晴天，還這世界一個原形吧！（卅四，一，八，雪夜）</p>

<p>— 桑紫</p>
<p>我爲金敏芝說故事。這孩子有超人的豐富想像；她聽着如入了迷，且參加自己的意見。</p>
<p>我吿訴她一對愛侶在大洋上海船沉沒時互相獻出自已生命的故事。她的晶瑩的眼眸幾乎有了淚痕，輕輕的說：</p>
<p>「我眞不知自已該怎麼辦了。」</p>
<p>我說到中世紀的王子和公主，她就忘記前一個故事所給予她的憂愁了。她髙興起來，露了笑容說：</p>
<p>「我歡喜他們的裝束。」</p>
<p>因爲她砍過一張關於王子和公主的神話的卡通片。那中世紀的騎士和美人的裝束。</p>
<p>我說完故事就要吿別回去。在門口，金敏芝以輕捷而細碎的脚步跟踪上來。</p>
<p>「再遲一會去。家里沒有人，」她的眼光帶些祈求。</p>
<p>我自已憎恨寂寞。在黄昏暮色中，寂寞乃是一種魔鬼。</p>
<p>「我們該做些什麼呢？故事已經說完了。」</p>
<p>我帮金敏芝在園子里砍劈細柴，我們把它搬進屋子，生起爐火來。金敏芝要我在爐邊坐下，她說：</p>
<p>「讓我做一會事，再來伴你談天。」</p>
<p>我蜷坐在熊熊的爐火邊，作着無際的思想的摸索。睜開眼看見金敏芝在忙碌着。我就笑了。</p>
<p>她看見我的笑容。在她做完事，靠我脚邊坐下時，抬頭問：</p>
<p>「有什麼好笑？」</p>
<p>我撫摩她的頭髮，回答說：</p>
<p>「我覺得我很幸福，因爲現在我們二人是這靜靜的溫暖的屋子的主宰者。」</p>
<p>她低下頭靜默了。我們的臉都映着紅色的火光；我們呼吸着幸福的空氣。</p>
<p>「我愛一種爐子有門如格子窗，」金敏芝有着柔和的聲音。</p>
<p>「熾着紅光的格子窗孕育幻想。</p>
<p>「現在你着什麽？』</p>
<p>我發現暮色已經完全潛入這屋子。屋角里爐火映着兩個年靑的面孔，實在乃是一幅動人的圖畫。金敏芝靠在我脚邊如一隻伶俐而怯弱的小貓，我用手輕觸她豐腴的面頰，說：</p>
<p>「你可懼怕黑暗？」</p>
<p>她抬起頭，兩顆烏亮的眼珠允如寳玉，譴責似的說：</p>
<p>「爲什麽要讓黑暗來威脅？」</p>
<p>我覺着有些羞愧。可是我也睜大眼睛，我們互相凝覦了好久。</p>
<p>爐火生光，也生溫暖。雖是靜默，我們毫不寂寞。</p>

<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>脚底下的一雙車胎底皮鞋，已破了一個洞，鞋底的車胎，也早給悠長的歲月磨得薄薄的了！</p>
<p>好多人都曾對我說，可以換一雙新的了！是的！我也已經預備下了一雙新的皮鞋。</p>
<p>可是；我倒也並不一定「喜新而　　」，事實上，「新」的暫時「擱而不用』，脚下仍是踏着那一雙破皮鞋來打發日子，每天平靜地跑着，走着……</p>
<p>許多人又爲我不穿那雙「新皮鞋」而奇怪，但是我却因爲那一雙「破的皮鞋」，穿在脚上很舒服，所以，就也並不去顧慮到別人的奇怪了！</p>
<p>那一雙「破皮鞋」買來的時候，當然也是嶄新的！黑橘皮的鞋面，厚車胎的底；價格是三十六大元，雖然在現在說來已好像是笑話，但，當時却已算是大價錢了！</p>
<p>不過，講實在，當時和現時間的一段時間的距離，却也相差得並不十分遠到需要用什麽世紀來計算的！</p>
<p>記得當時每逢穿它的時候，總是十分仔細地把「開滙鞋汕」，擦得它亮晶晶的，假使；再把現時「開匯鞋油」的價格核算起來，那末；那筆費，在當時已足够買那樣的皮鞋幾打而有餘。</p>
<p>當然，現在的它是早已失去了那樣的幸運了</p>
<p>那時的它，曾時常伴着我婆莎在燈紅酒綠的舞池裏，也曾把它踏在軟綿綿的綠草茵上散過步，此外；酒後的黄昏，　　被雨永濺濕，但，也曾被不少次春天的陽光愛撫過……</p>
<p>曾同我共過歡樂，但，也曾僕僕風塵的受過奔波的艱苦……</p>
<p>誰也換不住年羣的老去，它終於落入了現時的破舊。過去的歡情，它是再也沒法續叙，就是我吧，也早已意興蘭珊，而絕跡追歡塲中了！假使現時的我還不念舊情，那它可早就該藏身到垃圾箱裏去度那「　然神傷」的凄凉歲月了！</p>
<p>好在現時的我，到也不計較它的老舊，仍　它朝夕平安地追隨我的脚下，而我呢？也可以從它的身上，去重溫那遠去的溫馨的舊夢，因此；我就很願這賓生相得的局面能够拖延下去……</p>
<p>但，我總不能永久「終老於斯鄉，那末；「鵬程萬里」就恐非那一雙破舊的皮鞋所堪勝任的了！因此；以後它究竟還能追隨我多少日子，那恕我連自已也不敢確定了！</p>

<h3 id="c41">東華兩敗之後　期望聯誼隊能稱覇 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>本届足球聯賽，有東華先敗於葡商，再挫於球文都之後，已經兩失敗，恐難冉佔　首。昔日威風，而今盡付東流，令人莫測髙深。茲者，我人對從未有過敗績之聯誼隊，不能不寄予重之期望，觀乎該隊諸老將之努力不懈，各小將演出之令人滿意，確有中興氣象。因此，一般球迷，咸在思忖聯誼能登本届聯賽之覇座乎。</p>
<p>我個人之見解，素愛東華亦喜聯益隊，此決非鄙人愛聯誼之不賣力作風，實愛其隊員中有出類拔卒之技藝，如早能謹愼從事，以其人材而言，揚威滬濱，早成事實矣。</p>
<p>回溯上届聯誼之受挫，其主要原因爲人所共悉，即爲隊員精神欠佳，鮮於練習，以至不够氣者居多。於是要其成就，豈不難哉。夫一足球隊之成功，首重人材，此外精神與氣力，二者須兼備。能此三者齊備，則一球隊之演出，自必可得大衆之愛戴也無疑。</p>
<p>論本届之聯誼隊，自則鋒綫上得羅壽福之來歸，周麒麟之進步，乃益以其素稱鞏固之守衛綫。於是聯誼隊在人材方面，可構已齊備。至其精神及氣刀而言，因當局，鑒於上届之渙散，乃集中隊負住宿，頗見功效，故余以爲聯誼本届應取上届東華之威風而代之。</p>
<p>談其戰績，已勝過僑聯，以後尙餘二大勁敵相通，爲葡商及東華。聯誼能否一鼓而擒，非可推　，現鄙人不妨談其各個近况，亦所以望其能益加前進。</p>
<p>劉顯漢</p>
<p>似始終犯「怯塲病」據云顯漢在滬生活孤獨，每逢球賽，極鮮友朋熱情之烘托，此尤爲易於怯塲之主因，鄙人實寄與無限之同情焉。</p>
<p>吳祺祥</p>
<p>原力之充沛，技術之高超，本屬滬上罕見，唯時以冶遊而疏。迺者，本届旣集中訓練，恢復本來面目，近况之佳，有目共睹，上駟之材也。</p>
<p>李天生</p>
<p>能保持原態。天生年事已髙，實不敢望其有更多之發揮，有如成績，堪以慰矣。</p>
<p>宋靈聖</p>
<p>尙朱達其個人最顚峯狀態，有時甚現軟弱，而靈仔又爲該隊策動進攻，退守助禦之總　紐。故靈仔應有求氣足，方可不負衆望。</p>
<p>鄭英權</p>
<p>保持以往水準，然一時難見其特出之處，我見如此，不識是否？</p>
<p>瞿永福</p>
<p>各方面俱能予人較佳之印　，尤其技術方面，殊乏　足擊。惜乎阿福脾氣，難臻爐火純靑，輙至影響表演，深願力圖改過。</p>
<p>李義臣</p>
<p>懶牛已不懶，每賽努力以赴，其神技嘆爲觀止，尙希繼續此精神，確是滬上唯一中鋒，決非勞勃司托夫之堡恃乎竄及截麟經之徒憑技術，所可比擬。</p>
<p>高保正</p>
<p>肯付全力應戰，始終不渝，此爲小髙最博人贊美之優點，目下仍一貫作風，爲該隊生色不少。</p>
<p>羅壽福</p>
<p>以新將姿態，極有卯上之竄頭，尙以經騐不足，未能有最正常之期望，所須注意，臨陣鎭靜，不餒不屈，則以其球藝而談，不媿一內鋒之上將。</p>
<p>費春華</p>
<p>本届尙少露臉，觀乎其旣往之本領，　求體力有復元之象，演出可不使人失望。</p>
<p>周麒麟</p>
<p>情况甚佳，有進無退，殊足稱道。能在此情形而前，麒麟之左翼，當爲聯誼攻勢中之焦點，進而爲滬上缺乏此項人材之巨　，亦輕而易舉。</p>
<p>餘如許文奎之體氣堪憂，蔡聲　之專心管理，秀淸之尙待薰陶，不作高多談。以上十一員將士，如能納我貢獻，聯誼倘再勝葡商東華，奪本届之皇座，極爲可能，書此以勗勉！</p>
<h3 id="c42">六國健兒將爭奪　滬市拳擊皇座　定本月二十日舉行 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>在西洋，拳賽與球賽有着同樣强大無比的號召力，或許前者的吸引力量，比後者更有着出奇的呌座功能。美國名拳擊家綽號褐色轟炸機的喬路易，一發表出戰的預吿，座票馬上有人全部包去，造成全世界買飛機票的空前犯錄。在中國，情形有些不同，因爲拳賽無定期舉行，把觀衆的無趣無形低减。事實上，拳擊的無趣與欣賞上，眞比足球更剌激，更興奮，更緊張！</p>
<p>拳擊運動繼續提倡</p>
<p>本市拳擊運動的主持人，過去是回力球塲的經理欣聖鐸，他是這運動愛護提倡最力的唯一中堅。後來他離華去菲，便由其弟弟負責主持。中間曾由俄人與中靑相互的倡導，都因爲資力的短絀，陷於冬　的狀態中。這次欣聖鐸的弟弟，重起雄心，結集了同樣嗜好的國人，共同推行這蠶動已久的拳擊運動。</p>
<p>拳擊是力的最髙表現，它絕不假借，也不虛僞，全仗着拳頭上的力量，擊倒或挫折對手。在此刻現在的中國，對於這運動的倡導是絕對需要的。它能增高人們的勇氣，加强全身的力量，間接在優生學上樹立偉大的功勳。孱弱，懦怯，畏縮，退讓；在拳擊世界中是「一脚踢出去」，根本沒有存在的餘地。</p>
<p>六國健兒定期決鬥</p>
<p>本市的拳擊，已有八備月無聲無臭了。這次是樹起爭奪滬市拳擊皇座的旌旗，煽動全市愛好運動的羣衆注意。日期定於一月二十一日（星期日日）上午十時，假咸陽路回力球塲舉行。參戰的各國健兒，是把全滬好手一網打盡，包括中，德，意，俄，波六國英雄，陣容在過去可說是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>奪標爭覇最後一幕大決鬬，由波人坦地與德僑山姆劉可抗爭。坦地曾經小勝日人拳王羅田，在中國拳擊界燃起光芒的火燄。劉可是出名「打弗殺」的狠客，拼命肯幹，富於苦幹的精神，這一次交鋒會戰大家必不肯放鬆一步。國人李培根是少壯派天之　子。他在過去三戰中，頭二次因爲經騐不足，在分數上失敗。第三次便勇往直前，應付裕如，和前大不相同。第三回合中，一拳便把西僑擊倒在地，動也不能動。可見他的拳法精通，一日千里，六國人增加榮譽的光　。道次和俄僑維多比賽。他一定再以過去的勇狠，　成連勝的新紀錄。再有一位少壯名手林忠孚，出手矯舊，擊　勇猛，多次襲勝外僑，一洗東亞病夫的侮辱。這次出戰西僑香海，希冀他再下一個「不勝無替休」的死勁。</p>

<p>— 衆兆安</p>
<p>（十一）每次投籃，必須熟籌與審愼，勿便視作兒戲，隨便投出，希望碰巧命中。</p>
<p>（十二）勿常習慣將球轉動投籃，投籃應否將球轉動，須視距　遠近，及其角度與方向而定，大槪宜於遠距離，不宜於近投。</p>
<p>（十三）投籃應熟習各種方法，尤其是本人，尙未慣用之幾種，若常用一種投法，雖絕技亦易爲人防守。</p>
<p>（十四）投籃勿故作姿勢，裝弄花樣，以博得人羨慕，及一時之悅意，應儘量減去不需要之動作。</p>
<p>（丁）拍球</p>
<p>拍球在整個籃球運動中，其重要性，僅次於傳球與投籃。觀球員在塲中拍出拍入，機巧妙之處，眞可令人欣賞不已。但拍球須要手法正確，運用得宜，方始奏效，否則必致全隊失去機緣，進攻亦呆滯。常見許多球員，昧於祇顧拍球前進，而不知迅速將球傳遞。在籃下久候投籃之同伴，失去良機。或遇前面進攻路綫空虛，無人防守時，謬然在遠處投籃。而不知拍球前進，至近籃時投入，致被對方易得投不中之球。此皆不明運用拍球之故也。故拍球用得過多或過，均所不宜。且拍球過多，必致趨於個人技術表演主義，影響全隊合作之和諧性。其實拍球，非有適當時機，不應常用，尤其是不應養成習慣，一得球便拍。須知拍球前進，遠不如傳球之迅速也。現將拍球之正確姿勢及其用處要決與常識等，簡要分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）拍球之正確姿勢</p>
<p>在開始拍球時，先將球擊在地上，然後開步，以免犯持球行走之弊。球用手指張開推擊在地，待其反彈起來時，再行繼續向前續步拍擊。拍擊之法，祇須用手指及手腕之力，絕不可用手掌拍學，吾則必不能靈活。每次拍擊須使球完全受手指之管制，使其速度·髙度·與方向均能隨機應變，運用自如，以便通過進攻之路綫。除非前面無人攤阻，拍球宜低拍，不宜髙拍。但又不能太低，太低則不易管制，至多低不過膝，髙及腰間爲度。球應拍在身前，身體路向前豐，以掩護球之前進，兩目注視前囡之塲地，以便尋覓可通之路綫。常穿過敵人時，官拍得更低更快，着前路空虛，無人　守，則可放步疾走·球宜　得略髙，尤其是直衝向　投籃之時</p>
<p>（二）拍球之主要用處</p>
<p>拍球之用處茶多，茲擇其比較重要者分列於后</p>
<p>（一）當自已不便投籃，又不能傳球與被對方嚴密監守之同伴時，以拍球前進，俾可獲得較有利之地位。</p>
<p>（二）作爲一種聯合投籃之進攻方法。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Northern Plains of Luzon Island: A Major Decisive Battle is About to Unfold; Japanese Forces are Filled with Fighting Spirit, Seeking to Annihilate the Enemy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Manila, Philippines, 13th (Central News Agency) – Enemy American forces have landed two infantry divisions and one tank division in Lingayen Gulf. They are currently expanding their bridgehead at the landing site, seemingly attempting to greatly reinforce their landing forces. On the 11th, at dawn, under the assault of Japanese naval and air forces, the third group of transport convoys intruded into Lingayen Gulf. To protect the enemy transport convoys within Lingayen Gulf, the enemy is using a small-scale mobile force, mainly consisting of several converted aircraft carriers, patrolling the western part of Lingayen Gulf. Meanwhile, east of Taiwan, they are disrupting the Japanese army's rear supply bases. Around the 9th, part of the enemy mobile force suddenly moved southwest, appearing to be heading towards the South China Sea, attempting to avoid attacks by the Japanese naval and air forces in the inner waters. The enemy forces that landed on the shore of Lingayen Gulf have been striving to maintain a portion of the bridgehead since the 9th. The enemy's land operations are gradually entering a formal stage. The left wing of the enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf is gradually moving south, advancing towards Aguilar on the south bank of the Agno River. Their goal seems to be reaching the Agno River. In addition to using flame throwers, the enemy is also using rocket launchers, and some heavy artillery is being moved to the front lines. Japanese forces are filled with fighting spirit, awaiting the opportunity to crush the enemy. A major decisive battle is about to unfold on land in the northern part of the central plains of Luzon Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy American forces forcibly landed in areas such as San Fabian and Dagupan on the south bank of Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, they were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army and air force. On the 9th and 10th, they continued to transport troops and supplies ashore. Currently, the enemy forces that have landed in that area possess two infantry divisions and a tank unit of about 100 tanks, forming the core of a tank division. They are actively building a bridgehead along the coast. Except for a unit spearheaded by tanks on the San Fabian front, which has made slight progress, there has been no significant overall progress. The enemy's landing point on the Lingayen Gulf front is entirely a poor-quality, humid area, hindering the enemy's operational actions. However, the enemy continues to reinforce its landing forces, and the enemy's third convoy is continuing to sail towards Lingayen Gulf. At the same time, elite Japanese ground troops are continuously attacking the landing enemy forces. Furthermore, Japanese "Fugaku" and "Kamikaze" special attack units of the army and navy, as well as special attack units formed by army aircraft, are launching attacks daily, fiercely bombing the enemy ships within Lingayen Gulf. Most of the Japanese aircraft are one-way trips. The results of the battles on the 9th and 10th were announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 12th. The enemy's invasion operation in Lingayen Gulf has already suffered enormous losses.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army Launches Surprise Attack on Enemy Headquarters on Miyako Island <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Stockholm (via Seoul), some Japanese soldiers on Miyako Island are currently hiding in caves and jungles on the island, awaiting the opportunity to fight the enemy, often causing great distress to the American forces. According to a dispatch from Miyako Island by the International News Agency, a unit of Japanese soldiers on the island is constantly appearing and attacking American barracks. In particular, three days ago, they broke into the headquarters of the American 11th Bombardment Squadron, which had recently moved from Saipan, causing considerable alarm. According to the report, the Japanese suicide squad only broke through the sentry line around the headquarters before being repelled by the American forces that quickly gathered. Therefore, the headquarters has been particularly reinforced in recent days.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to an announcement by the American Wartime Information Bureau on the 12th, the losses of American army and navy personnel since the start of the war total 646,380. Secretary of War Stimson also stated in a confidential conversation on the 11th that the losses of the army total 544,351, but the losses suffered from the German counteroffensive since December 16th of last year are not included. Therefore, the above figures represent only a portion of American military losses.</p>

<p>Capital Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e8">Mayor Zhou Xuechang Discusses the People's Livelihood in the Capital; Special Correspondent of This Newspaper <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>– Dan Ming</p>
<p>I have been in Nanjing for over a week. Seeing the fluctuations in prices in the capital, I cannot help but pay attention to the municipal government's administration. Therefore, on the morning of January 5th, I drove to the municipal government on Zhongshan North Road to visit Mayor Zhou Xuechang.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou is from Baoding, Hebei. Before the Incident, he worked in the education and political circles for many years and enjoyed a high reputation. He served as the Director of the Education Bureau of Peiping and the Director of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province. He is a politician who dares to speak and act. Later, he was ordered to inspect the southeastern war zone. Dissatisfied with the dark political situation in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces at the time, he resolutely broke away from the Chongqing government. Coincidentally, the late Chairman Wang advocated for peace, and at the invitation of Mr. Zhou Fohai, he participated in the peace movement, serving as the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan. At that time, Chongqing had not yet learned of this. It is said that they even announced Zhou's appointment as the Deputy Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Region Administrative Supervisory Office. I had admired the reporter for a long time, but had never met him.</p>
<p>Upon meeting me, Zhou said, "I met President Chen of your newspaper once before the Incident. I will go to Shanghai at the end of this month and have a thorough discussion with him."</p>
<p>Commodity Circulation</p>
<p>"Does the Mayor often go to Shanghai?" I asked. "I rarely go to Shanghai usually," he replied. "Before, each trip would only cost 30,000 or 40,000 yuan, but now it would cost several hundred thousand!"</p>
<p>"Speaking of the current high cost of living," I continued, "I would like to ask about the general livelihood and economic situation of the capital."</p>
<p>"Let me give you a general overview," the Mayor said after thinking for a moment. "I came here to be mayor with the determination to prioritize the people's livelihood. Therefore, all materials here, except those controlled by the military and the Ministry of Industry, are not restricted in any way, and are allowed to circulate freely. As a result, although prices here have gradually increased recently, they are much cheaper compared to Suzhou and Shanghai." "Then," I asked again, "what is the situation with rice?"</p>
<p>"The rice situation is also better than elsewhere," he said, taking a puff of his cigarette. "The rice here is supplied by six counties: Jiangning, Jiangpu, Lishui, Liuhe, and Jurong. These six counties are all outside the military rice area, so there is absolutely no problem in meeting the needs of the general public."</p>
<p>Rationing System</p>
<p>"What is the quantity of rice rationed to each citizen?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"Four 'he' per person per day," the Mayor continued, "which can be said to be better than Shanghai. Moreover, the municipal government distributes all daily necessities allocated from Shanghai to the general public without any omissions, unlike some places where there is no rationing system and they are instead thrown into the black market for profit."</p>
<p>"However," the Mayor paused and said, "the allocation of materials in Shanghai is sometimes not very fair. For example, for sugar, Shanghai has already reached the 17th allocation, while Nanjing has only reached the 8th allocation, and even the price of the 8th allocation is the same as the current 17th allocation. Perhaps they mistakenly believe that Nanjing is the same as other places and does not implement a door-to-door rationing system!"</p>
<p>"I now completely allocate all materials to the citizens," Zhou said eloquently. "For example, cigarettes. Shanghai does not have household rationing, but here they are rationed in the same way as other daily necessities. The Allied economic advisors all believed it was unnecessary, but I still want to ration them, because this is the only way to suppress the external black market!"</p>
<p>"Mayor, you can manage the economy with this spirit," the reporter said, "truly benefiting the residents of the capital."</p>
<p>"It's not about benefiting," the Mayor said. "No matter what, I have to be responsible for the lives of the citizens as long as I am in office. Therefore, if the price of rice continues to rise in the next few days and the rationed rice is not distributed by the end of the month, I am prepared to open up the restrictions on rice circulation."</p>
<p>"What are the current restrictions on the movement of rice for residents of the capital?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"It's the same as Shanghai, one 'dou'," he replied.</p>
<p>Allied Cooperation</p>
<p>"Regarding the various economic measures you mentioned," the reporter asked again, "what is the level of cooperation from the Allies?"</p>
<p>"That is not a problem," the Mayor immediately replied. "They are very trustworthy. As long as the local officials do not want to abuse their power for personal gain, their assistance will be immediate. In this situation, Chinese and Japanese merchants are treated equally. For example, to conserve electricity, several stores that were using Japanese merchant licenses did not obey the orders. After the Japanese consulate police authorities were notified, they immediately went to seal them off."</p>
<p>"Mayor," I changed the subject again, "what are your thoughts on the current situation?"</p>
<p>"No matter what," Zhou said with a smile, "I always feel that Japan is our true friend, and the imperialistic practices of Britain and the United States should be opposed."</p>
<p>"Premier Koiso said in today's newspaper that the enemy seems to be shifting the center of the decisive battle to the Pacific," the reporter asked again, "I wonder what the Mayor thinks about the future of our country?"</p>
<p>Zhou said, "Is that so? If the war lasts too long, the people's livelihood in our country will really be unbearable."</p>
<p>By the time he said this, it was almost noon. When I said goodbye, Mayor Zhou gave me his personal phone number and hoped to have another in-depth conversation. I thought he was truly a mayor who treated newspaper reporters with the utmost respect!</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Munitions is determined to promote the construction of additional power plants. To complete them during the dry season, they have strongly promoted the final stage of construction. By the end of this year, 43 new power plants nationwide will begin generating electricity, nine of which were not originally part of the planned construction. This is due to the efficient use of labor and materials by those involved. During the dry season, concentrating on completing large and small newly built power plants will greatly contribute to the enhancement of the motive power for military production.</p>

<h3 id="e11">The People's Livelihood and the Evacuation of the Population <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>– Renjie</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city that has developed abnormally. Although it is a leading metropolis in China and a center of industry and commerce in Central China, it differs from other normally developed cities in the world. Its prosperity is mainly based not on its connection with inland China, let alone with the surrounding rural areas, but on foreign international trade. Whether it is commodities, raw materials, capital, or technology, they have all developed under this abnormal state. This, on the one hand, illustrates the contradictory nature of this "international" city, and on the other hand, it explains the difficulty of solving the various problems facing the city.</p>
<p>In recent years, maritime transport has been cut off, and land transportation has also been obstructed. Meanwhile, the population has surged, and the production and import of living materials have decreased, while the consumption of living materials has increased. This has provided an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of, and has become a hotbed for all kinds of profiteers. The hardship of the people's livelihood will inevitably affect social order. After the Greater East Asia War, the strengthening of the Baojia organization has made a considerable contribution to the maintenance of social order, but the entire problem cannot be properly resolved. Whether from the perspective of the people's livelihood or social order, "increasing production" is a necessary and urgent task; however, concrete strategies for this will take a considerable amount of time to take effect. The current problem of the people's livelihood and its resulting impact has reached a fairly serious level. Therefore, in addition to long-term plans, there is also a need for resolute and decisive emergency measures.</p>
<p>Naturally, a thorough solution to the people's livelihood problem awaits the victory of the Greater East Asia War, or at least the cessation of blind resistance. However, the Chinese people are the most kind and realistic: they only ask for the bare minimum conditions for survival, and their interest in politics is not very high. When their bare minimum survival needs cannot be met, they cannot muster enthusiasm for any "good governance." Though they may not speak out, they are hesitant in their hearts. Therefore, the current reality is: severe livelihood difficulties are enough to affect the Greater East Asia War, enough to affect the success or failure of construction in the peace zone, enough to affect the hearts of the people, and enough to affect the soundness of administrative agencies, the effectiveness of administration, and the many regular operations of various industries that are necessary in peacetime, and especially in wartime. The most obvious is the transportation industry, and other public services are also affected, so that the authorities' various facilities, although they have been carefully studied by various levels of government, often fail to achieve the expected results, and even often have the opposite, unnecessary, adverse effects when implemented. It has recently been reported that the authorities are considering thoroughly improving the rationing system and implementing a focused rationing plan to improve the people's livelihood, stabilize prices, and eliminate corruption. This may not be an inappropriate plan for adapting to the times, but if the root cause of the abnormal population concentration, the reduction of producers, and the increase of consumers cannot be effectively resolved, then its effectiveness will still be limited. Because economic and social problems cannot be solved solely by distribution. In the current decisive battle period, both military needs and civilian needs must be taken into account. When it is difficult to solve the problem of increasing production for a while, the rationing system should be improved, but if the supply problem cannot be solved, profiteers and extortionists will still have room to thrive, so no matter what, its effectiveness will always be limited. The phenomenon of layoffs in the industrial and commercial sectors is gradually becoming more widespread. The industrial and commercial sectors may have their own unavoidable difficulties, but this will further sharpen the contradiction of reducing producers and increasing consumers. Therefore, in addition to stabilizing prices, increasing production, investigating and punishing corruption, thoroughly investigating hoarding, and focusing on rationing... there is also a need for active population evacuation.</p>
<p>Most of Shanghai's population originally came from bankrupt rural villages, and more have come after the war due to poor social order in various places. This precisely explains why the citizens of Shanghai, whose standard of living is already at the highest peak in the country, have not universally evacuated, which also explains the difficulties of individual evacuation and voluntary return to their hometowns. Therefore, population evacuation must take planned steps, with group evacuation as the main method and individual evacuation as the supplement; proactively integrate production and construction into the evacuation work. The authorities should adopt methods of guidance, encouragement, and assistance, not just simply allowing them to return to their hometowns voluntarily, nor just advocating for publicity or forcing evacuation through administrative methods.</p>
<p>In summary, the difficulties of the evacuation work are mainly: (1) no way to make a living after evacuation, (2) poor social order in various hometowns, (3) various difficulties in transportation and the prevalence of extortion by bad military police, (4) due to the consistent mentality of seeking temporary peace among the citizens, they do not see the serious situation that is about to come, and thus drift along.</p>
<p>In response to the above points, we suggest several methods: (1) Prioritize the evacuation of enterprises, institutions, organizations, and schools that have a necessary evacuation. Once the center changes, it will naturally affect the direction of the entire citizenry. At the same time, it will also incidentally produce the effect of promoting prosperity in various places. (2) Under the advocacy and supervision of the authorities, the workers laid off by various industries should be organized by various industry associations, hometown associations, and other mass organizations to find appropriate destinations based on various possible conditions to organize production enterprises, or cultivate land, or trade, or run small-scale factories or handicraft factories. Governments at all levels should provide the necessary practical benefits and convenience. (3) Promote the "Return to Hometown" movement. Absolute convenience should be provided in transportation, and the government should instruct transportation agencies to ensure the safety of luggage transportation. Simplify all procedures as much as possible. (4) Population evacuation should become one of the main policies. Change the past practice of muddling along, and governments at all levels should provide guarantees and assistance to the work of various gold industry organizations. Use this as an important standard for assessing the performance of civil servants. Those who take advantage of the difficult times to poison the people should be severely punished. (5) The media, charitable organizations, welfare organizations, hometown associations, and other publicity agencies should immediately begin to study and promote this work and its detailed implementation plans, so that evacuation becomes a voluntary and active movement of the people.</p>
<p>In this decisive battle year, it is likely that the enemy will attempt to disturb the hearts of the people in the rear. I hope that all sectors will not take the issue of population evacuation lightly.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Cabinet Meeting Decides Wartime Important Policies; Strive to Fully Complete Aviation Military Production <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese cabinet decided on the "Five Major Decisive Battle Policies" on the 12th, which was announced the same day by the Japanese Information Bureau. Its aim is to align defense with general administration, and to implement policies swiftly, thereby establishing a unified military-political system and enabling the Central Supreme War Guidance Council to operate effectively. At the same time, the heads of local administrative councils, military commanders, and commanders-in-chief of naval districts must maintain close contact. Through the establishment and operation of these three-party committees, important policies decided by the central government will be forcefully implemented. Regarding communication between local administrative councils and the military, there have always been liaison councils in various localities, and military personnel and local officials or relevant parties have also been in contact from time to time. This measure aims to integrate the heads of local councils, military commanders, and commanders-in-chief of naval districts into a single entity. Central plans and policies centered on the Supreme War Guidance Council will be rapidly implemented according to local conditions, leveraging the nation's total strength to invest in aviation production to meet the needs of the front lines. Under this unified defense-production system, the government currently intends to implement measures including increasing aviation military production, increasing food self-sufficiency, and ensuring that the people strive to make all materials readily available to meet the needs of combat power. The Chief Cabinet Secretary is currently finalizing the complete plan, and its full picture will soon be clear.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Decides to Submit a Foreign Capital Bank Bill</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government decided at a cabinet meeting held on the 12th to submit a foreign capital bank bill to the Diet. The main points of the bill have been released by the Japanese Information Bureau. Its main content is to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War, preparing necessary methods for raising foreign capital to streamline fundraising. At the same time, to adapt to future changes in the economic situation, enabling flexible operation is also an excellent way to realize smooth financial management. A foreign capital bank will be established with a capital of 50 million yen. Furthermore, the Japanese government is striving to streamline the abundant economic power of various parts of Greater East Asia, and the fundraising of necessary funds has been entrusted to the Southern Development Bank and other relevant financial institutions, which should allow for the concentration of funds. The main institution of the foreign capital bank will be located in Tokyo, and its main business will be the planning and utilization of foreign capital in accordance with national policy, in addition to handling government-specified loans, deposits, and other businesses, as well as managing relevant government-specified price investigation matters. With government approval, the foreign capital bank may handle a portion of banking and other businesses, and the surplus funds of the foreign capital bank will be transferred to the government. In addition, if there are losses in business operations, they will be compensated by the government.</p>

<p>Farewell Tea Party by Colleagues of the City Government</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government was ordered to be honorably transferred to the position of Minister of Judicial Administration, and Chief Secretary Sun will also be honorably transferred soon. All colleagues of the City Government held a grand farewell tea party at the Hua Mao Apartments on the eleventh floor at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th) to bid farewell to Secretary-General Wu and Chief Secretary Sun. Secretary-General Wu and Chief Secretary Sun arrived on time. More than 100 colleagues of the City Government attended, including Ling Xianwen, Pan Da, Qu Xunyi, Shen Guanzhun, Liang Miaozhang, Zhang Enlin, Yuan Junchang, Sun Guangdi, Advisor Hibino, and Consultant Hirano Osamu. First, Councilor Ling Xianwen delivered a farewell speech, followed by Advisor Hibino, who delivered a speech on behalf of the Japanese staff of the City Government to thank Secretary-General Wu. Then, two commemorative silver plates were presented to Mr. Wu and Mr. Sun. Finally, Mr. Wu and Mr. Sun first gave thank-you speeches and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Acceptance Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's reply was as follows: "In August of the year before last, I followed former Mayor Chen and assisted in the takeover of the former International Settlement and French Concession. Later, I was ordered to serve concurrently as the Director of the former First District Office and the Secretary-General of the City Government. During this short period of one and a half years, I completed the merger of the first and second districts and the merger of the City Government and the former First District, thereby promoting the unification of Shanghai's municipal administration. The significance of this move in the history of Shanghai's municipal administration and its impact on the future development of Shanghai are well understood by everyone and need not be elaborated. Recalling my tenure in the former First District Office, I am deeply grateful for the assistance of Chinese and foreign colleagues. Although our nationalities are different, we have the same purpose in working together and cooperating to promote municipal administration. I have always been sincere in my dealings and have strived to promote emotional harmony with a friendly spirit. These precious memories will never be forgotten. The Shanghai City Government is a Chinese administrative organ, but from another perspective, it has its own unique points. Therefore, the general administrative measures of the City Government require the assistance and cooperation of foreign technical personnel. If foreign personnel who have served in the City Government for a long time can continue to发挥their talents, the solution of various technical problems can be greatly facilitated. This is what I deeply hope for. In today's high-inflation environment, the treatment of all colleagues urgently needs to be improved, which should be noted by the authorities as soon as possible. In the past, under the orders of the Mayor, I once used the income from tax collection to increase subsidies for adjustment, but this move is only the initial step of adjustment, and is still far from the actual goal of improvement. I feel particularly inadequate in this regard and am ashamed of myself, and I hope that everyone will forgive me. Today, I am very grateful for everyone's warm hospitality, and I wish everyone a bright future and good health."</p>
<h3 id="e20">Income Tax Office Closes Office Affairs Meeting; Approves Important Tax Policy Proposals <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The fifth Office Affairs Meeting of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, regarding the important tax, economic, and other proposals submitted by the directors of various regional offices, was completed in group review the day before yesterday (the 12th). Yesterday (the 13th) at 2:00 PM, the meeting continued to be convened for discussion, still chaired by Director Qiu Fangmo. It was not until around 5:00 PM that all proposals were discussed and finalized, and the meeting was adjourned. It is learned that the results of this meeting passed the following important tax-related proposals:</p>
<p>(1) The assessment results of the collection offices under the jurisdiction of each district office should be realistically adjusted and submitted to the office for review. The office should strictly order each office to conduct realistic assessments and readjust them.</p>
<p>(2) In order to address the sharp increase in estimated revenue for the first half of the 34th year, it is proposed to discuss joint consultation methods, and to request modification of various tax rates in the first, third, and second categories. In addition to the first method listed in the fourth proposal, which concerns changes in tax regulations and should be discussed later, the remaining second and third clauses and the eleventh proposal will be discussed together and retained.</p>
<p>(3) In order to strengthen the administrative punishment powers of various bureaus and offices, it is proposed to determine enforcement methods to emphasize tax administration. It is requested that the Ministry be notified to instruct the provincial and municipal governments to order their subordinate police agencies to strictly enforce the cessation of business operations.</p>
<p>(4) The increase in tax collection quotas for the 34th year is huge, and it is difficult to handle. Now that the start of collection is approaching, it is proposed to allow the Ministry to issue clear instructions according to the established case of last year to facilitate tax affairs. It is requested that the office submit a report to the Ministry to issue a proclamation in advance, setting a deadline for payment, with severe punishment for those who delay.</p>
<p>(5) It is proposed that the office issue a circular to all district offices, limiting the time to uniformly implement the C-class income tax to increase national tax revenue and equalize the burden on merchants. The office should issue a circular to all offices to carefully handle the matter, taking into account the circumstances, to avoid suspicion of imposing excessive taxes.</p>
<p>(6) It is proposed that the office issue a circular to all district offices regarding the tax revenue of the 33rd year, ordering them to carefully audit and collect taxes and not to apportion or accept voluntary contributions. If there is any resistance or obstruction, it should be reported to the Ministry for legal action. It is also requested that the local chambers of commerce be instructed to inform all guilds to comply. The office should submit a report to the Ministry to instruct all offices and chambers of commerce to inform all guilds to comply.</p>
<p>(7) It is proposed that the office formulate a reward system for reporters of company mergers, reorganizations, dissolutions, closures, or transfers to facilitate tax collection. The office should formulate a reward system and submit it to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(8) It is proposed to rectify the interest income tax on third-category deposits. Please submit a report to the office to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(9) Because earth cream shops continue to operate as usual, it is proposed that the office issue a circular to all offices to tax them according to Class C for three months as a period to prevent merchants from evading taxes and increase income. In addition, for the Hongji Shantang and various earth cream shops and opium cessation centers in various parts of Central China, which were changed to commercial operations in April of the 33rd year, investigate the business situation. The annual development situation, and the large quotas for the 34th year, are of great importance and should not be neglected as usual. It is proposed that at the time of tax collection this year, the competent collection agencies in various places should conduct a serious investigation and report the collection, in accordance with regulations, to prevent concealment and emphasize the source of tax revenue. The office should issue a circular to all offices to comply.</p>
<p>(10) It is proposed to heavily reward informants to encourage them and prevent evasion and leakage. The office should submit a report to the Ministry for approval.</p>

<p>Minister Tsuchida, in order to connect with colleagues in the Chinese press, hosted a banquet at the Broadway Mansions at 6:00 PM on the 13th for executives and colleagues of the News Association. In addition to Minister Tsuchida, Secretary Okumura, Director of Information Matsudaira, and Vice-Consul Fukuma also participated on the host side. On the guest side, those who attended included Li Sihao, President of the Chinese News Association, Qin Mosen, Standing Director, Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch Association, Osaka Yochi, Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbai, Xu Liqiu, Lu Feng, Huang Jingqi, Moriyama Kyo, and Zhang Zhaoming, Secretary of the Board of Directors. First, Minister Tsuchida gave a speech, stating: Since I took office in November of last year, I have heard that the News Association was established in September. Due to busy official business, I have not had the opportunity to approach colleagues in the press. The establishment of the News Association has two characteristics: first, its nature is national; second, the colleagues participating in the association are all authorities in the press representing public opinion. Therefore, I place great expectations on the News Association to lead the people and enlighten culture in the future. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive phase. The war in the Philippines is becoming more intense. The Japanese military has a Kamikaze Special Attack Force that sinks enemy aircraft carrier battleships or transport ships with one aircraft. The Japanese people are all determined to carry out the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of the Kamikaze Force's dedication to the country, in order to achieve final victory. I hope that your country's press will also lead the people to jointly achieve the final goal, etc. Then, Li Sihao, the new chairman of the association, stood up and gave a reply. The party ended happily at around 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Chinese Inventors Association, in view of the current limitations on factory power, urgently needs a remedy. After working with experts for days to research and develop a cattle-powered engine, which is a mixture of animal power and machinery, it is most suitable for five-horsepower and ten-horsepower. The propulsion of the cattle-powered engine is very strong, and it is cleaner and more suitable than firewood and charcoal. It costs only 500,000 yuan to install five horsepower. Its daily expenses, if calculated at eight hours per day, are only the feed for two cattle. Compared with firewood and charcoal, the ratio is ten to one. It is reported that a patent has been applied for from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the authorities have been asked to conduct a public test.</p>

This period is purchased with the 37th Comprehensive Ration Certificate, and the validity period expires on the 17th of this month. I hope citizens will pay attention. The reason for shortening this period by three days is that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the office intends to continue to distribute sugar once after the end of this period, considering the customary need for sugar among citizens.</p>

<p>Huadong Elementary School Establishes Free Enrollment Quota: Guo Xiushi, the principal of Huadong Elementary School on Kunming Road, Hongkou, in view of the vastness of the Hongkou area and the fact that it is a factory-concentrated area with a large number of children of workers and merchants who are unable to attend school, has decided to expand the free enrollment quota to 300 from this year onwards. All impoverished children can register for school with a certificate from the Baodu chief of this district. However, it is heard that the number of places is limited, so register as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e29">Reasonable School Fees, Hoping Authorities of All Schools Adopt Them <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>This semester has already ended, and schools will routinely begin winter vacation. After three weeks, the next semester will begin again. During this short period, which parent isn't worried about their children's tuition fees, except for a small number of wealthy families? They usually save every penny, and are already struggling financially. How can they not feel a headache when a huge amount of tuition fees suddenly appear? For example, if a family has three children in school, at the middle school, elementary school, or even at the university level, averaging twenty thousand yuan per person, it would require sixty to seventy thousand yuan to manage. Moreover, they are limited to paying it all off before the Lunar New Year. I think eight or nine out of ten parents will have to borrow money with worried faces. Where will they find generous relatives and friends willing to donate? The result will either be pawning clothes and jewelry, or turning to desperate measures. Since tuition fees vary from school to school, it is hoped that the authorities of each school will reduce them as much as possible. Parents will benefit greatly, and the gratitude will be immense! When school starts and tuition is due, it would be best to consider being accommodating, allowing installments to be paid or providing a certain number of half-fee slots, at least accounting for 10% of the student body. As for the school's finances, they should be transparent, and the treatment of teachers should also be reasonable. Salaries should be paid in three-month installments, and one semester should be paid in two installments. If this can be implemented, it will benefit both the public and the private sectors; it will be a clear conscience for the country and the people. Furthermore, the name "school shop" and the widespread complaints about principals enriching themselves can be swept away, bringing a glimmer of hope to the education system. It all depends on the principal's kind intention.</p>
<p>Strenuous Effort Troupe Enthusiastically Assists Education</p>
<p>A letter from the members of the Strenuous Effort Troupe states: "Dear Sirs, 'Strenuous Effort' is a troupe that only invests labor and has no financial foundation. We are a group of 'poor performers.' Our strength is very limited, but when we think of our peers who are blessed by the times, but are suffering to the point of not even having the opportunity to go to school, we can no longer consider our own weakness. Zhuangzi said, 'Fish stranded in a dry rut moisten each other with their breath and dampen each other with their saliva.' The one hundred thousand yuan we are sending is just a little bit of our mutual aid. Of course, the vastness of the river is what everyone is eagerly looking forward to."</p>
<p>(Note) All the members of the Strenuous Effort Troupe truly live up to their name, working hard for the art of theater. They enjoy meager rewards and endure hardship, occupying a glorious page in the history of drama. I remember that in October two years ago, when "Strenuous Effort" was founded, until the end of March this year, they performed six months of charity performances at the Paris Grand Theater for this newspaper's scholarship fund, performing plays such as " ", "Model Gentleman", "Double Happiness", and "Robot", which caused a sensation and achieved great success. Yesterday, they generously donated one hundred thousand yuan to establish a team. Your enthusiasm for helping students is a model for all theater troupes in Shanghai. Your high regard and deep friendship are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Shanghai New High School Exhausts Efforts to Solicit Donations</p>
<p>A letter from Shanghai New High School states: "Dear Sirs, since your newspaper established the scholarship fund, it has benefited the poor students and benefited society, which is deeply admirable. Now that the semester is changing, and funds are urgently needed, our class students have initiated a frugal scholarship fund movement to respond. Fortunately, with the help of parents and relatives, we have raised 156,000 yuan. It was decided that half of it would be sent to the News Report. We are honored to send it to your newspaper in the name of 'Shanghai New High School Class 2B Team' and 'Dai Ziyuan Team.' We are sending a check for 78,000 yuan with this letter as proof. This small amount is not enough to be of great assistance, but it represents our sincere heart."</p>

<h3 id="e33">Special Attack Force: The Achievements of the Kaoru Airborne Troops <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>They finally did it! Landing in enemy territory and charging in, if possible, even taking advantage of the dark night to descend on the enemy's airfield and destroy enemy aircraft. This heroic so-called human beauty has finally realized the dream of impossible tactics. This unit, this terrifying unit, this incomparably proud unit, this fearless and invincible unit, is the special attack force Kaoru Airborne Troops. This is a melee unit that has never been seen before in war history, landing in enemy territory. It is not a night dream, nor an imagination. At the 〇〇 base, where enemy air raids were very fierce, reporters once lived and worked with this melee unit. Now, the reporters, with a full heart of emotion, are writing this report about the Kaoru Airborne Troops under the flickering light of the coconut oil lamp.</p>
<p>Destroying Enemy Aircraft, Leaving None Remaining</p>
<p>"The logic of destroying aircraft is the same as shooting birds. It is difficult for even the best shooters to shoot down every bird flying high in the sky. However, when the birds return to their nests, it is much easier to catch them. Aircraft are similar. It is not easy to shoot them down in the air. If you want to destroy a large number of aircraft, you can only do so on the airfield." Due to this great principle of aviation strategy, this extremely daring enemy landing aircraft destruction team was formed. Unlike paratroopers who land on uninhabited plains, they take large transport aircraft and land in the center of the enemy airfield. As soon as the aircraft lands, they jump off nimbly. As soon as the captain's order is given, they pounce like apes on the enemy aircraft on both sides of the runway or in the shelters, placing the strong explosives they carry on the important parts of the enemy aircraft. One after another, quickly and nimbly, the enemy aircraft on the airfield are destroyed cleanly in an instant, leaving none remaining. This is truly an unprecedented and ingenious unit.</p>
<p>Seeing in the Dark Night, Moving Like the Wind</p>
<p>The Kaoru Airborne Troops are composed of Japanese warriors selected from various units and special volunteer soldiers from Taiwan. The team members are all vigorous young people with an average age of twenty-four. They grew up in Taiwan, where the sun is scorching, the mountains are rugged, and the plains are green. From a young age, they have cultivated a strong fighting spirit to defeat the enemy. They are most skilled at moving in mountainous and dense forests, are not afraid of the scorching heat, are brave and aggressive, and take immense pleasure in participating in this battle. They also have a unique skill, which is the ability to see in the dark night. Their night vision is truly amazing! In the so-called dark night where you cannot see your fingers, they can usually see clearly thirty meters away. If they squat down and observe using a special identification method, they can see fifty or sixty meters away, and skilled people can even distinguish who a person is at a hundred meters away.</p>
<p>Not afraid of the heat, seeing in the dark night, moving like the wind. These are all most suitable for a surprise attack team landing in enemy territory at night. As for the vigorous spirit of attack, it is beyond words. Every team member has the spirit of fighting to the death. Moreover, they are disciplined, move quickly, and are all willing to dedicate their lives to the country.</p>
<p>Special Attack Force Captain Nakae Shigeo Lieutenant Junior Grade once told reporters about his subordinates, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Sometimes, their behavior can be a model for us. They have great respect for people from the mainland, so we must not do meaningless things. A few days ago, the team was staying in a Filipino house. When the team members were cleaning the house, they found that a lot of vegetables had been forgotten on the veranda. They immediately sent it to the Filipino family who had moved away. The Filipinos did not have the custom of returning lost items, so they were surprised and delighted, and were very grateful. They insisted on sending pork, fruits, and other things to the team members as a reward.</p>
<p>A Treasured Sword, Killing Enemies</p>
<p>"All team members pride themselves on being Japanese citizens, and each has a volunteer sword. They are allowed to carry this sword. This sword, passed down from ancestors, is used very skillfully. The blade is only slightly less than two feet long, but after rushing into the enemy ranks, it will surely cut down several soldiers. They all know this lethal swordsmanship."</p>
<p>The Kaoru Airborne Troops, which are enough to terrify American soldiers, although composed of cadres and soldiers selected from various units and Taiwanese soldiers, were not hastily assembled recently. They began intensive training from the past 〇 month and have been waiting for an opportunity until today. Specialized training is conducted at night. The reporters had the opportunity to observe this rigorous night training several times, especially the training on the night before this attack, which was the most realistic and intense.</p>
<p>The Last Night Training</p>
<p>That night, the reporters obtained the captain's permission to report the training situation to the rear, so they used flashlights to illuminate the vicinity of the runway of the airfield where the night training was being conducted in the pitch-black night. Ah, there they are! Isn't that the large aircraft of the transport team? The training has already begun!</p>
<p>The door of the large aircraft opened silently. Now it is assumed that the enemy army airfield is landing for a moment. The captain jumped down first, with a white belt across his chest, forming a diagonal cross; it was the company commander. Next, the platoon leader, Lieutenant Junior Grade Suhio, also tied a white belt. The team members who jumped down one after another were wearing strong bombs on their chests, each of which could destroy an enemy aircraft, carrying enough food for 〇 days on their backs, and carrying guns and their heirloom sharp blades. Several soldiers were carrying submachine guns in their right hands.</p>
<p>As soon as he jumped down, the captain ran suddenly to about fifty meters away, and the team members followed the captain one after another. The captain conveyed the order in a low voice, designating the target. The attack began. All that could be seen were rapidly running shadows. The team members, holding explosives in their hands, ran separately to the imaginary enemy aircraft, jumped on the aircraft, set the explosives, and then scurried down like monkeys, continuing to attack the next enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Everything was silent, and even the sound of footsteps was careful. Suddenly, there was a shout from behind. Then, the action training that the unit should have after being discovered by the enemy army began. A group rushed into the enemy ranks like asuras, and another group seized the opportunity to pounce on the enemy aircraft. The attack ended, and everyone rushed to the pre-designated target location, crossed the jungle like apes, and reported the results back to the base.

<h3 id="e34">Center of the Philippine Islands Campaign <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The biggest purpose of the enemy Americans landing on Mindoro Island is to establish a strong airbase. There was an airfield near San Jose before the war, and now the enemy is using it as a center, constructing several other airfields to gather large aircraft and fighters. Although the enemy Americans suffered heavy losses on Leyte Island, they are still launching a new landing operation south of Ormoc and adopting an offensive posture. They are also advancing towards Mindoro Island with a strong fleet and transport convoy. From this perspective, it is possible that the enemy Americans, relying on their abundant supplies, will land in new locations in the future.</p>
<p>Leyte Island is Important</p>
<p>The ground battle on Leyte Island is extremely fierce, and the enemy Americans are launching offensives everywhere. On the other hand, they are also trying to consolidate their position on Mindoro Island. This strategic arrangement is clearly intended to take advantage of the gaps and expand the breakthrough. As Japan concentrates its forces in the future, the Philippine Islands campaign may become more intense, and the future cannot be overly optimistic. However, whether the enemy's tactics can truly exert their power depends on the future development of the war situation.</p>
<p>We calmly judge that the enemy army is only trying to maintain this posture, regardless of heavy sacrifices, which shows that the overall situation of the Philippine Islands campaign is not necessarily favorable to the United States. Moreover, the enemy Americans' forces are dispersed, and the Japanese army has an opportunity to take advantage of. The enemy army's landing on Mindoro Island was not a predetermined step in the enemy Americans' operations in the Philippines, but an accidental operation caused by the stalemate on Leyte. Even in the United States, it is believed that this move is extremely risky, and the future is still difficult to predict. MacArthur, in order to break the stalemate on Leyte, had no choice but to ignore everything and rushed into Mindoro Island.</p>
<p>The stalemate on Leyte was unexpected for the enemy army. Based on the experience of Saipan, the enemy Americans believed that they could take it in one fell swoop with their naval power and abundant military supplies, end the war in a short period of time, and establish a base to sweep through the Philippines. But to their surprise, in the two months since landing, their biggest goal of establishing a land-based airbase could not be achieved. Instead, they lost the Broyon and Samba Pablo airfields that they had initially captured. The Teler airfield was also unusable due to the Japanese army's counterattack. To date, only the Tacloban airfield has forty or fifty small aircraft.</p>
<p>Aircraft Production is More Important</p>
<p>The enemy Americans' operational goals have clearly failed. The Japanese army's land forces' attacks on Morotai Island, the damage to the enemy Americans on the waters of Taiwan and the Philippines, and the kamikaze attacks have all been unexpected obstacles for the enemy army. This is the biggest reason for the stalemate on Leyte. In the future, even if the enemy army achieves some success in the ground battle on Leyte, it is not related to the enemy army's ultimate goal of making Leyte a base. For the enemy army, it is simply a waste. The landing on Mindoro Island was a risky move made out of anxiety and disappointment by the enemy Americans. Its supply line is very long, and if the Japanese air force is still alive, it cannot be allowed to run rampant. Therefore, we must not be confused by the battle on Mindoro Island and must pay attention to the development of the Leyte campaign. The biggest goal of this battle is to defeat the enemy army on Leyte Island. The victory on Leyte is the victory in the Philippine Islands campaign. Mindoro Island is just an orphan surrounded by the Japanese army and is easily resolved. The problem is that even with the insufficient air power on Leyte, it is now necessary to allocate a portion to deal with Mindoro Island. Therefore, the production and replenishment of aircraft are even more important, and the rear production camp needs to step up its efforts. (Translated from the December 22nd Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Japanese Navy Gunnery School 1 <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Navy Gunnery School is an institution for mass-producing young commanding officers for the Japanese army's land warfare and air defense. It is like a factory forging refined steel, creating countless military talents through rigorous training.  It is urgently necessary to cultivate capable young officer candidates for aerial and fleet battles; and strengthening land warfare and air defense forces to repel enemy troops and drive away enemy aircraft is even more crucial. Therefore, the special feature of the training at the Gunnery School, which cultivates young commanders for land warfare and air defense, emphasizes education, and all students cultivate a spirit of certain death in rigorous training.  Many students come from arts and law backgrounds, but their eyes are clear as crystals, without a trace of selfish thoughts. They act in unison as soon as they receive a noble order. In just a few months, no trace of students can be seen on any face; instead, they are transformed into excellent naval personnel.</p>
<p>Air Defense Drill</p>
<p>While intense training in enemy landing and waterside interception is unfolding on the coast, high-angle gun operation training has also begun in a corner of the bare mountain to the south.  Around the giant high-angle guns, the reserve officers are at their stations. "Air combat! "Advance left, Grumman, altitude ○○, fire!" As the command rings out, the reserve officers move as quickly and accurately as machines.  With a deafening roar, the giant gun roars into the sky, and the loading mechanism immediately opens.  One person removes the cartridge case, another loads the shell, and a new shell slides into the gun chamber. There is no hesitation, no disparity, they move like well-oiled machinery.</p>
<p>"What? Already exhausted?"</p>
<p>"No." The answer is like anger. How bright the sound!</p>
<p>A high-angle gun that can fire ○○ shells weighing □□ kilograms per minute can be operated by only □ people. Moreover, there are no relief personnel, because on the front lines, even if only one gunner remains, he must load and fire the gun alone. Therefore, there are no relief personnel in the air combat here. The training is rigorous and intense, with the aim of ensuring that even in such unfavorable environments in the future, they can resolutely continue the fight to shoot down enemy planes.</p>
<p>Spiritual Training</p>
<p>Thus, the reserve officers diligently learn various gunnery operation methods, searchlight and anti-aircraft light operation methods, anti-tank warfare tactics, aircraft identification, and command methods in this rigorous training.  Simultaneously with air defense combat training, there is also combat training in dark nights and dense forests, as well as special waterside combat.  Like good blotting paper, they learn the practical training of land warfare from all angles.  During this period, their character is also cultivated, so that they possess the temperament that a Japanese naval officer should have.  Every reserve officer is forged into a flawless great man of the sea, both spiritually and physically.  The commanders of land warfare and air defense are like Japanese swords without the slightest bump.</p>
<p>In the quiet night with the faint sound of the tide, the reporter asked the reserve officers during self-study time about their current state of mind and their hopes for those who follow.</p>
<p>"The most important thing is to abandon self. I hope the younger generation will do the same," replied Mr. Soya Aoki (graduate of the Faculty of Law, Dada University).</p>
<p>"We are all deeply moved by the heroic struggles of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force. We also fervently hope to follow the Kamikaze team in the battle for land warfare and air defense. And we hope that future generations will be robust and continue to be reserve officers," said Mr. Masakazu Takahashi (graduate of the Faculty of Law, University of Tokyo).</p>
<p>"The joy of directly charging and killing enemy soldiers is supreme. All the younger ones, as long as you have passion and spirit, you can do well. In the past, I didn't understand the concept of life and death, and it was difficult to decide on my own direction in life. After coming here, my heart suddenly became clear, and I felt that dying for the motherland was nothing," said Mr. Tamotsu Miura (graduate of the Faculty of Law, Kyushu University).</p>
<p>The other answers also expressed the same loyal and pure heart, wishing to leave a legacy for posterity.</p>
<p>Practical Experience</p>
<p>As for the instructors who train this group of pure young men, they are also very young, ranging from twenty-two to thirty years old, and are all officers who graduated from this school as reserve officers. Among them, such as Major S, Lieutenant K, Lieutenant E, Lieutenant F, etc., survivors of the Solomon campaign, almost all have experience in New Guinea, New Georgia, the Philippines, or northern operations.</p>
<p>Lieutenant K told the reporter: "The reserve students and students initially enter the school with excited feelings. They have knowledge and education, but they lack the ability to execute, so they feel very painful inside in the short term. However, after rigorous training, they no longer have the concept of students, and forget everything about themselves. I think that land warfare and air defense are fundamental battles, just like pickled vegetables cannot do without a pickling stone, but even with it, you can't see any obvious effect. In short, with land warfare and air defense, we can establish naval and air combat results." (Correspondent Quente) (Translated from the December 2nd *Mainichi Shimbun*)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Symphony of Poverty and Illness <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Shufang</p>
<p>Sunday is supposed to be the only day I can relax in my life. I ate a bowl of noodles haphazardly in a noodle shop, thinking about Yi Ping whom I hadn't seen for a week. I had no desire to return home. This room, which couldn't be any smaller, was filled with all kinds of daily necessities, and I was too lazy to tidy it up. Leaning on the bed, I lit a cigarette out of boredom. The door opened, and Yi Ping came in.</p>
<p>I jumped up and threw away the cigarette. The early winter sun shone in faintly. I watched Yi Ping's golden, silky curly hair being kissed by the sunlight. In a familiar gesture, she pulled her hair with her hand, avoiding my eyes, and slowly tidied up the mess on the table for me.</p>
<p>Strolling down the street is our weekly task, and today is no exception. As soon as we left the house, we turned onto several streets and arrived at Jing'an Temple Road. This is the most suitable road for walking. We talked about our professional situations. In the past, we loved to talk about eating and playing, but now that I have become a failure on the economic front, I am afraid to mention money. Yi Ping also knows that I am financially strapped, so she avoids talking about these extravagant things. Slowly, we talked about the weather. From the weather, we talked about clothes. Yi Ping told me that she wanted to make a long wool coat, preferably dark blue, with a generous style and a not too expensive price. Originally, we were talking in a question-and-answer manner, but now I was silent. The store windows were plastered with sale advertisements. Models were wearing new early winter clothes, showing graceful postures, attracting passersby who were winking at them and sighing. Finally, Yi Ping also stopped enviously in front of a fashion company. In the window, there was a navy blue coat. According to Yi Ping, the texture of the fabric met her ideals. The price tag on the coat, with white letters on a red background, was 16,000 yuan. Yi Ping happily sought my opinion. I had to nod reluctantly, and my heart gradually became uncomfortable. I hated myself, hated this fashion company, and hated this world even more. After ten minutes of lingering, Yi Ping realized that she did not have the means to buy this coat, and silently dragged me forward. She was disappointed because she could not get what she loved, and I was uncomfortable because I could not satisfy the desires of the person I loved.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Yi Ping sighed and said, "Maybe I will never be able to afford a coat in my life!" I suddenly flared up, feeling that her words were extremely insulting. I said with a sneer, "Blame yourself for being blind and falling for a poor wretch like me," and couldn't say a second word. I turned and walked away, despite Yi Ping's constant screaming for me. I didn't look back and ran home in one breath.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I graduated from university and found a position in a bank. That year, I got engaged to Yi Ping. At that time, I was full of youthful pride. I had graduated from school, found a job, and succeeded in love. What else could I say?</p>
<p>Just entering society, I was full of hope, believing that I had a bright future. My parents died early, leaving me an estate that was not much, but still considerable. I grew up in the arms of my widowed aunt, who loved me like a mother. For many years, I studied in Shanghai, and she never cut off my money, giving me as much as possible to spend. There was a lot of land in the countryside, which ordinary people thought would never run out. On the one hand, I worked hard to study and disciplined my body and mind. On the other hand, I was very proud that I had so much property. If I could have a decent profession, plus these family properties as a backing, then my future would be very optimistic. I deeply believed in myself.</p>
<p>Yi Ping also had no parents and lived in her brother's house. Although her sister-in-law didn't treat her well, her brother really loved her. So, this pair of orphans loved each other, hoping to create a bright future together. At first, human relations were very happy. Yi Ping was a teacher in a school. We agreed to work hard in our respective careers, save money, and budget that in three years, we could accumulate a sum of money for our wedding expenses. A year passed quickly! I gradually felt an economic threat. Because of inconvenient transportation, the money from my hometown always came very late. Under these circumstances, I had to use my salary to maintain my life. The high-speed rise in prices made me try my best to catch up, but I always fell behind. Since this year, according to a letter from my aunt, my hometown is experiencing a drought, and the fields have yielded nothing. Life in the countryside is also very difficult, and there is no money to send out. When I received this letter, I felt like I had been hit hard on the back, and a kind of fear grew in my heart. Coupled with the recent living standards, I was even more breathless. I had heard friends' advice to run to the stock market, but when I saw the ups and downs of the prices on the blackboard, the sweat on people's heads, and the hoarse shouts, I left there dejectedly. I thought I would definitely get heart disease in that kind of place, and I didn't have the courage to speculate, so I became poorer day by day.</p>
<p>Men seem to have a kind of nature, which is to spend money for women, even if they are poorer themselves, and the money comes harder, they must pretend to be "lavish and unsparing" in front of women. If a woman accidentally takes out money, the man feels unhappy, even feeling it as an insult and contempt. I also tried my best to pretend to be nonchalant in front of Yi Ping. The clever Yi Ping had already known that I had this kind of hidden pain, but she was unwilling to expose it, for fear of hurting my self-esteem.</p>
<p>She often secretly added all kinds of food and supplies for me, trying her best to avoid making me feel poor and unhappy. Although she had her brother to provide for her living, she didn't have much money saved up. She had never complained to me about being poor, and I had never complained to her about not having money to spend. We were both reserved and understanding.</p>
<p>After arguing with Yi Ping, I cried all night. New and old sorrows flooded my heart. Money, it's all because of money. I tossed and turned on the bed all night, and couldn't get up at dawn. I fell asleep in a daze, and when I woke up, it was almost noon. I had fallen ill like this. I was sleeping alone, and no one came to ask about me. Now I was eager for Yi Ping to come, and I was willing to admit my mistakes and repent in front of her.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, my head felt like it was about to explode, and my mouth was as dry as anything. I wanted to struggle to get up and pour a glass of water, but I was so dizzy that I couldn't stand up, and I fell back on the bed in a daze. In a trance, it seemed like someone was walking in front of my bed. When I opened my eyes, it was Yi Ping, whom I was thinking about. I felt a pang of sadness in my heart and started to sob. She stroked my forehead and wiped my tears. I wanted to apologize to her, but I couldn't say a word, just kept sobbing. She poured me a glass of water to drink, and then went to buy porridge and vegetables, and fed me with a spoon. She said, "I know you are suffering because you are unwilling to give up this kind of vanity. Your temper has been so bad this year because this year is the year we planned to get married. You don't have money, and you are unwilling to tell me, but I knew it a long time ago!" She paused slightly and turned on the electric light.</p>
<p>"In this day and age, I don't know how many young people are living painful lives under psychological contradictions. But having money doesn't represent success. Maybe they commit sins for money and let their descendants suffer the consequences. Women seem to love money mostly, but you can't say that every woman loves money. Although the current world is a world of money, I also want to be particular about material things, but when I think of the threat to life and the difficulty of earning money, I immediately dismiss those thoughts. At first, I always felt a little sad. But when I thought of the poor laborers and the starving beggars, I immediately felt enlightened. In the end, right and wrong overcame vanity. The first three-year plan has failed. There is also a second three-year plan. We are so young, it doesn't matter if we get married three years later. Remember, life has to be fought for!"</p>
<p>Yi Ping served me the porridge, said she would come back to see me tomorrow, and then went back, leaving behind an empty room and an empty me.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I had a fantasy that I wanted to earn a lot of money and dress Yi Ping as a noble woman. When we walked in and out hand in hand, I wanted others to cast envious eyes on us.</p>
<p>Today, I suddenly remembered this thing again, and I smiled bitterly! But, I think there are still three years!</p>
<h3 id="e37">Snow <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>I am not a talented scholar who composes poems in a warm pavilion. When I want to look for plum blossoms, I am naturally not a recluse who "rides a donkey over a small bridge and sighs alone at the slenderness of the plum blossoms." I am just an ordinary person in the world who has to get up at dawn every day and hurry on the road for the sake of life. For this reason, snowy days are of no benefit to me.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>To be honest, I really don't have a good impression of snow.</p>
<p>Naturally, like others, snow also brought me a vague memory. In that memory, the spring snow of my old home arose, lowering the plum branches...</p>
<p>But people don't live in memories forever. What is before us is reality.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I walked on an uneven road in the snow.</p>
<p>I began to feel disgusted with the snow. Several times I tentatively stepped on a soft white snowflake, and several times I was splashed with dirty water from under that snow.</p>
<p>People know that snow is pure and beautiful, but they only see the surface.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Therefore, I prefer "sleet."</p>
<p>Sleet is certainly not as beautiful as dry snow, but it melts as it falls, and everything is still clearly visible, so it won't trick travelers.</p>
<p>So I thought that those who sing the praises of snow's beauty must be empty talkers who strike a high note!</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Here is another charge against snow.</p>
<p>There was a relatively high spot in the snow, and when I stepped on it, I found it was a straw bag with an abandoned baby inside.</p>
<p>I felt a chill. Snow is the cover for all sins.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>A child fell in the snow, and when I wanted to help him up, I almost slipped myself.</p>
<p>"You can't do good," S said from the side.</p>
<p>"If that's what it means to be a good person, I'd rather fall a few more times," I said.</p>
<p>But there are almost no such good people in the world.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>The children and I were busy building a snowman in the courtyard.</p>
<p>"What's the point?" One child said with worldly wisdom, "As soon as the sun comes out tomorrow, it will melt right away. It's all for nothing."</p>
<p>So I set a truth for the children.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In the evening, the snow was still falling. The streetlights were dismal.</p>
<p>"A traveler returning home on a windy and rainy night," I whispered.</p>
<p>So we thought of that lonely, weary traveler, Wei Liansheng, a traveler returning home in the wind and snow. Silently, we listened to the rustling sound of our feet on the snow.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>L came from Southeast Asia and had never seen snow.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow I must find someone to take some pictures. I have never seen so much snow."</p>
<p>"Poor person," I thought, "If you see the many days in the north, when you see that vast expanse of ice and snow, what will you do?"</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>"Do you think it will still snow tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"No," I looked at the gray sky,</p>
<p>To be honest, I really don't want it to snow again, because I don't have a good impression of snow.</p>
<p>I hope there will be a good sunny day tomorrow, and return the world to its original shape! (34, 1, 8, Snowy Night)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Twilight Fireside <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Sang Zi</p>
<p>I tell stories to Jin Minzhi. This child has superhuman imagination; she listens with rapt attention and adds her own opinions.</p>
<p>I tell her the story of a couple who sacrificed their own lives for each other when a ship sank in the ocean. Her glittering eyes almost filled with tears, and she said softly:</p>
<p>"I really don't know what I should do."</p>
<p>I tell her about a prince and princess from the Middle Ages, and she forgets the sadness given by the previous story. She becomes happy, and shows a smile, saying:</p>
<p>"I like their clothes."</p>
<p>Because she has seen a cartoon about a prince and princess myth. Those medieval knights and beautiful women's clothes.</p>
<p>When I finish the story, I am about to say goodbye and go back. At the door, Jin Minzhi follows up with light and quick steps.</p>
<p>"Go back later. There's no one at home," her eyes carrying some pleading.</p>
<p>I myself hate loneliness. In the twilight of dusk, loneliness is a kind of demon.</p>
<p>"What should we do? The stories are finished."</p>
<p>I help Jin Minzhi chop up thin firewood in the garden, we move it into the house, and light a fire. Jin Minzhi wants me to sit by the stove, and says:</p>
<p>"Let me do something for a while, and then keep you company and chat."</p>
<p>I curl up by the roaring fire, making endless explorations of thought. I open my eyes and see Jin Minzhi busy. And so I laugh.</p>
<p>She sees my smile. When she finishes her work, she sits down by my feet, and looks up to ask:</p>
<p>"What's so funny?"</p>
<p>I stroke her hair, and reply:</p>
<p>"I feel that I am very happy, because now the two of us are the masters of this quiet and warm house."</p>
<p>She lowers her head in silence. Our faces are both reflected with the red light of the fire; we breathe the air of happiness.</p>
<p>"I love a kind of stove that has a door like a lattice window," Jin Minzhi has a gentle voice.</p>
<p>"Lattice windows blazing with red light breed fantasies."</p>
<p>"What are you looking at?"</p>
<p>I discover that twilight has already completely crept into this house. In the corner of the room, the stove fire reflects two young faces, truly a moving picture. Jin Minzhi leans by my feet like a clever but timid kitten, and I touch her plump cheek with my hand, saying:</p>
<p>"Are you afraid of the dark?"</p>
<p>She raises her head, two black and bright pupils, like gems, and says as if reproaching:</p>
<p>"Why let the darkness threaten us?"</p>
<p>I feel somewhat ashamed. But I also open my eyes wide, and we stare at each other for a long time.</p>
<p>The stove fire gives light, and also gives warmth. Although it is silent, we are not at all lonely.</p>

<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>The pair of car tire-soled leather shoes on my feet already have a hole, and the car tire soles have long been worn thin by the long years!</p>
<p>Many people have told me that I could change to a new pair! Yes! I have already prepared a new pair of leather shoes.</p>
<p>But; I don't necessarily "love the new and despise the old." In fact, the "new" ones are temporarily "put aside," and my feet are still hitting the road in that pair of worn-out leather shoes every day, calmly running and walking...</p>
<p>Many people are puzzled by my not wearing the "new leather shoes," but I find that the "worn-out leather shoes" are very comfortable on my feet, so I don't bother to care about other people's puzzlement!</p>
<p>When that pair of "worn-out leather shoes" was bought, they were, of course, brand new! Black orange-peel-like shoe surface, thick car tire soles; the price was thirty-six yuan, which sounds like a joke now, but it was considered a lot of money at the time!</p>
<p>However, to be honest, the distance between that time and the present is not so far apart as to require calculation in centuries!</p>
<p>I remember that whenever I wore them at the time, I always carefully applied "Kaihui shoe polish" to make them shine, and if I were to calculate the price of "Kaihui shoe polish" now, then that expense would have been enough to buy several dozen pairs of such leather shoes back then with money to spare.</p>
<p>Of course, the shoes have long lost that kind of luck now.</p>
<p>At that time, they often accompanied me as I danced in the brightly lit dance halls, and they were also used to step on the soft green grass while strolling. In addition, they were sometimes splashed with rain after drunken evenings, but they were also caressed by the spring sunshine many times...</p>
<p>They shared joy with me, but they also endured the hardships of travel...</p>
<p>No one can escape the aging of years. The shoes finally fell into their current dilapidated state. The past joys can no longer be continued. Even I have long lost my interest and have disappeared from the pleasure-seeking venues! If I didn't remember the old affection now, then the shoes should have long been hidden in the trash to spend their desolate years of "natural sadness"!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don't care about their old age now. I still let them follow my feet peacefully day and night, and I can relive the distant, warm old dreams from them. Therefore, I very much hope that this mutually beneficial situation can be prolonged...</p>
<p>But, I can't permanently "grow old in this village." In that case, "a great journey" would probably not be something that pair of worn-out leather shoes can handle! Therefore, how many days they can still follow me in the future is something I can't even be sure of myself!</p>

<h3 id="e41">After Two Losses by Tung Wah, Hopes are Placed on the League Team to Win the Championship <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>In this year's football league, Tung Wah has already suffered two losses, first to Portuguese merchants and then to Qiu Wendu, making it difficult to regain the top spot. Their past glory has now flowed entirely to the east, making it difficult to fathom their current state. Now, we can't help but place great expectations on the League team, which has never suffered a defeat. Observing the tireless efforts of the older players and the satisfactory performance of the younger players, there is indeed a sign of revival. Therefore, general fans are wondering whether the League team can ascend to the championship of this year's league.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that I have always loved Tung Wah and the League team. This is definitely not because I don't appreciate Tung Wah's hard work, but because I admire the outstanding skills of the players in the League team. If they could have acted cautiously earlier, with their talent, it would have been a fact to promote their reputation in Shanghai long ago.</p>
<p>Looking back at the League team's defeat in the previous league, the main reason is well known, that is, the players' spirit was not good, they rarely practiced, and most of them lacked energy. How can they succeed? The success of a football team depends first on talent, and also on spirit and energy. If all three of these are available, then the performance of a team will undoubtedly be loved by the public.</p>
<p>Regarding this year's League team, since the return of Luo Shoufu on the front line and the progress of Zhou Qilin, coupled with its consistently solid defense line, the League team can be said to have all the necessary talent. As for its spirit and energy, because the authorities, in view of the disorganization of the previous league, have focused on accommodation for the team, which has been quite effective, so I believe that the League team should take the prestige of Tung Wah in the previous league and replace it this time.</p>
<p>Speaking of its record, it has already defeated the Overseas Chinese League. In the future, there are still two major rivals, Portuguese merchants and Tung Wah. Whether the League team can defeat them in one go cannot be inferred. Now I might as well talk about their current situation, which is also to hope that they can make further progress.</p>
<p>Liu Xianhan</p>
<p>Seems to always suffer from "stage fright." It is said that Xianhan lives a lonely life in Shanghai. Every time there is a game, there is very little enthusiastic support from friends, which is especially the main reason for his stage fright. I really give him unlimited sympathy.</p>
<p>Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>His original energy is abundant, and his skills are superb, which is rare in Shanghai, but he often neglects his training due to his fondness for pleasure. Now that he has focused on training this year, he has restored his original appearance. His current state is obviously good, and he is a top-quality player.</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Can maintain his original state. Tiansheng is already old, so I don't dare to expect him to perform more. His current achievements are enough to be gratifying.</p>
<p>Song Lingsheng</p>
<p>Still lacks the peak state. Sometimes he seems weak, and Lingzai is also the general hub for the team to launch attacks and retreat to defend. Therefore, Lingzai should strive to be energetic so that he does not fail to live up to expectations.</p>
<p>Zheng Yingquan</p>
<p>Maintains his previous level, but it is difficult to see his special features for a while. This is what I see, I don't know if it is true?</p>
<p>Qu Yongfu</p>
<p>Can give people a better impression in all aspects, especially in terms of skills, but is lacking in a final strike. Unfortunately, A Fu's temper is difficult to achieve perfection, often affecting his performance. I sincerely hope that he can strive to change.</p>
<p>Li Yichen</p>
<p>The lazy ox is no longer lazy. He strives to do his best in every game. His skills are amazing. I hope he continues this spirit. He is indeed the only center forward in Shanghai, and is definitely not comparable to the likes of Robert Stoff or those who rely on skill, such as Jie Linjing.</p>
<p>Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Is willing to put all his efforts into the battle and remains unwavering. This is Xiao Gao's most admirable advantage. He is still consistent in his style and adds a lot of color to the team.</p>
<p>Luo Shoufu</p>
<p>With the posture of a new player, he is very eager to show his head. However, due to lack of experience, it is not possible to have the most normal expectations. What needs to be paid attention to is being calm in the battle, not being discouraged or giving up. Then, in terms of his skills, he is worthy of being a top general in the inner front.</p>
<p>Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Has rarely shown his face this year. Judging from his past skills, if he can restore his physical strength, his performance will not disappoint people.</p>
<p>Zhou Qilin</p>
<p>His situation is very good, with progress and no retreat, which is commendable. If he can continue in this situation, Qilin's left wing will be the focus of the League team's attack, and it will be easy to become a big name lacking such talent in Shanghai.</p>
<p>As for Xu Wenkui's physical condition being worrying, Cai Sheng's focused management, and Xiuqing's still needing to be nurtured, I will not talk too much. If the above eleven generals can accept my contributions, it is very possible for the League team to defeat the Portuguese merchants and Tung Wah again and win the championship of this league. I write this to encourage them!</p>
<h3 id="e42">Athletes from Six Countries Will Compete for the Shanghai Boxing Throne, Scheduled for the 20th of this Month <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>In the West, boxing matches and ball games have the same powerful appeal, and perhaps the former's appeal has an even more surprising crowd-pulling function. As soon as the famous American boxer Joe Louis, nicknamed the Brown Bomber, announced his fight, the tickets were immediately bought out, creating an unprecedented record for buying airplane tickets around the world. In China, the situation is somewhat different, because boxing matches are not held regularly, which invisibly reduces the interest of the audience. In fact, boxing is more exciting, more exhilarating, and more tense than football in terms of excitement and appreciation!</p>
<p>Continue to Promote Boxing</p>
<p>The person in charge of boxing in this city was formerly the manager of the Jai Alai Stadium, Xin Shengduo. He was the only mainstay who loved and promoted this sport most vigorously. Later, he left China for the Philippines, and his younger brother took over the responsibility. In the middle, Russians and Chinese youth jointly promoted it, but they were in a dormant state due to a shortage of funds. This time, Xin Shengduo's younger brother has rekindled his ambition and gathered like-minded Chinese people to jointly promote this long-dormant boxing sport.</p>
<p>Boxing is the highest expression of strength. It is neither borrowed nor false. It relies entirely on the power of the fists to knock down or frustrate the opponent. At this moment in China, it is absolutely necessary to promote this sport. It can increase people's courage, strengthen the strength of the whole body, and indirectly establish great achievements in eugenics. Frail, cowardly, timid, and retreating; in the boxing world, they are "kicked out" and have no room for existence.</p>
<p>Athletes from Six Countries Scheduled to Fight</p>
<p>Boxing in this city has been silent for eight months. This time, the banner of competing for the Shanghai boxing throne is raised to arouse the attention of the masses who love sports in the city. The date is set for January 21 (Sunday) at 10:00 a.m. at the Jai Alai Stadium on Xianyang Road. The athletes from various countries participating in the battle have captured all the good players in Shanghai, including heroes from China, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Poland. The lineup can be said to be unprecedented in the past.</p>
<p>The last big fight for the championship will be contested by Polish athlete Tandi and German expat Sam Liu. Tandi once defeated the Japanese boxing champion Luotian by a small margin, igniting the flame of light in the Chinese boxing world. Liu Ke is a well-known tough guy who "fights to the death." He is willing to work hard and is full of the spirit of hard work. Everyone will definitely not relax in this battle. Chinese athlete Li Peigen is a young talent. In his past three battles, he failed in scores the first two times due to lack of experience. The third time, he moved forward bravely and coped with ease, which was very different from before. In the third round, he knocked the Westerner down to the ground with one punch, unable to move. It can be seen that his boxing skills are proficient and improve rapidly, adding glory to the people of the six countries. Dao Ci will compete with Russian expatriate Weiduo. He will definitely use his past courage and ruthlessness to achieve a new record of consecutive victories. There is also a young and famous player, Lin Zhongfu, who is skilled in his moves and fierce in his attacks. He has repeatedly defeated foreigners, washing away the insult of the Sick Man of East Asia. This time he will fight the Westerner Xiang Hai, hoping that he will use his "no victory, no rest" spirit.</p>

<p>— Zhong Zhaoan</p>
<p>(XI) Each shot must be carefully considered and prudent, do not regard it as child's play, and throw it out casually, hoping to hit by chance.</p>
<p>(XII) Do not often get into the habit of rotating the ball when shooting. Whether or not the ball should be rotated when shooting depends on the distance, as well as the angle and direction. Generally, it is suitable for long distances, but not for close shots.</p>
<p>(XIII) Shooting should be familiar with various methods, especially the few that you have not used habitually. If you often use one shooting method, even a superb skill can easily be defended by others.</p>
<p>(XIV) Shooting should not be deliberately postured, or trickery to gain admiration and temporary pleasure. Reduce unnecessary movements as much as possible.</p>
<p>(D) Dribbling</p>
<p>Dribbling is only second to passing and shooting in importance in the entire basketball game. Watching players dribble in and out of the court, the cleverness of the moves can be admired endlessly. But dribbling requires correct technique and proper use to be effective. Otherwise, it will inevitably cause the entire team to lose opportunities and stagnate the offense. It is common to see many players who only focus on dribbling forward, but do not know how to quickly pass the ball. Comrades who have been waiting for a long time under the basket lose their good opportunities. Or when the offensive route in front is empty, with no one defending, they mistakenly shoot from a distance. And they do not know how to dribble forward and shoot when close to the basket, so that the ball is easily missed by the opponent. All of this is because they do not understand the use of dribbling. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use dribbling too much or too little. Moreover, excessive dribbling will inevitably lead to individual technical performanceism, affecting the harmony of the team's cooperation. In fact, dribbling should not be used often unless there is a suitable opportunity, especially it should not become a habit to dribble as soon as you get the ball. It is necessary to know that dribbling forward is far less fast than passing the ball. Now, the correct posture for dribbling and its uses, key points, and common sense will be briefly described below:</p>
<p>(I) The Correct Posture for Dribbling</p>
<p>When starting to dribble, first hit the ball on the ground and then start walking to avoid the disadvantage of walking with the ball. Use your fingers to spread out and push the ball on the ground, and wait for it to bounce back before continuing to dribble forward. The method of dribbling only needs to use the strength of the fingers and wrist, and never use the palm to pat the ball. Otherwise, it will not be flexible. Each dribble must allow the ball to be completely controlled by the fingers so that its speed, height, and direction can be adapted to the situation and used freely to pass through the offensive route. Unless there is no one blocking the front, the dribble should be low rather than high. But it cannot be too low, too low will not be easy to control, at most no lower than the knee, and no higher than the waist. The ball should be dribbled in front of the body, and the body should lean forward to protect the ball from moving forward. Both eyes should be focused on the court in front to find a passable route. When often passing through enemies, the officer should dribble lower and faster. If the road ahead is empty and no one is guarding, you can let go and run quickly. The ball should be dribbled slightly higher, especially when rushing straight to the basket to shoot.</p>
<p>(II) The Main Uses of Dribbling</p>
<p>There are many uses for dribbling. Now I will choose the more important ones and list them below:</p>
<p>(I) When it is inconvenient for yourself to shoot, and you cannot pass the ball to a teammate who is closely guarded by the opponent, you can dribble forward to obtain a more favorable position.</p>
<p>(II) As a way to jointly shoot the ball.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Hua Lian Basketball Team Coach—Zhang Youxiang <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory Basketball Team is the leader of the Shanghai basketball league. The team won the third Chenyou Cup and the Xiqing Championship the year before last. In the final of the open league, they voluntarily gave up. Last year, they continued to win the Chenyou Cup championship and were tied for champion with Zhongbei in the Shenbao Cup. The team is average in talent, able to defend and attack, has superb skills, strictly observes discipline, and is loved by the audience. The team owes its excellent results today to coach Zhang Youxiang.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has been researching basketball for more than a day. In the past, when Father Lao was in charge of the Chinese basketball hall, he was already the main player of the Yaoguang team. Therefore, today, coaching Hua Lian, the results are remarkable. In addition to Hua Lian, the only Western basketball team in Shanghai, Menok, is also under his command. Mr. Zhang's leadership of the team has been outstanding, just like his management of the Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory. He is thirty-seven years old this year and is from Hangzhou. He graduated from the Department of Pharmacy of the Sino-French University and has a deep understanding of Ye Xue. In addition to serving as the director and general manager of Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory, he also serves as the director and general manager of Hua Lian Chemical Factory, and the director of Cathay Pharmacy Shanghai Utensils Company Epihi Candy Company. Director of the Pharmaceutical Masters Association and supervisor of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association. In terms of sports, he serves as the vice chairman of the Shanghai Basketball Association and is also a member of the Basketball Referees Association. His character is based on the word "truth." He likes to study, does not stick to conventions, seeks truth from facts, and is dedicated and consistent. Whether running a business or coaching a team, he does it with a consistent spirit, without being slack and succeeding in the end.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Sports Tidbits <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Jiaxuan, director of physical education at Shanghai Girls' Middle School, is scheduled to marry Mr. Zhou Zhixin, a basketball star at the Shanghai Bank, at the Bankers Association tomorrow (the 15th). With common interests and common ground, both will be able to get help in their careers in the future.</p>
<p>The Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory Basketball Team has the determination to go on a long march to Pingjin, but hopes that there will be no traffic problems at that time. Then this southern team's expedition to the north will begin with Hua Lian. It is also heard that Mr. Zhang Youxiang once talked with Mr. Xie Yiqin, hoping that if possible, the Green Team will also travel together at that time, and the harvest will definitely be greater.</p>
<p>Lu Guoxun, a basketball long-range shooting expert, has joined the Tung Wah Basketball Team, but Xiao Lu is busy on the Shanghai-Ningbo Road, selling tea, and it is a pity that he cannot fully devote himself to basketball.</p>
<p>Zhongbei team member Zhao Zhilin has always had good social skills and is now the general manager of the Far East Restaurant on Avenue Joffre. The restaurant has low prices and good quality, and people in the sports world may wish to try it out.</p>
<p>Tung Wah rookie Tao Tingfu recently graduated from the Youth Air Defense Headquarters. He was among the best and is now the instructor in various Baojia districts and is sure to give full play to what he has learned. (Jing Duan)</p>
