<p>〔本報重慶廿六日專電〕馬歇爾到渝以後，共產黨代表曾向特使表示，共產黨願無條件停止軍事行動，但在今日政府與共產黨商談中之共產黨代表，聞仍以共產黨人員擔任政府官職，為先決條件。至政治協商會議，各方均作積極準備，民主同盟，青年黨，及共產黨方面，均設有秘書處，從事工作。聞該會將在下月中旬舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶廿六日電〕中共代表周恩來氏昨稱：共產黨將於今日國共恢復停頓業已五星期之談判時，正式提出無條件停戰之書面建議。吾人亟願立即停止戰門，此舉之重要，在任何事件之上。此次建議之提出，曾得毛澤東氏之核準云。按國共間斷斷續續之談判，迤延已逾一年，最後一次，談判停頓已來，迄今亦有五星期之久。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫數廿六日電〕倫敦消息靈通人士預料莫斯科三强外長會議之最後公報及議定書，將於四十八小時內發表：甚至有在今夜（上海時間週四淸晨）發表可能，據本社外交訪員稱，三外長進行談話之迅速，多因彼等均願於工作中度過耶誕節有以致之。茍無其他阻緩，則英外相貝文或將於本週杪之前返抵英國，約有兩週之期，可準備定於一月十日召開之聯合國大會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿六日電〕英美蘇三國外長於聖誕日午後四時開會，至晚間九時半未散，實爲歷來會議中最長之一次。觀察家評論會議所宣佈之臨時報告，認爲乃結果成功之徵兆。英美首腦對於會議之發展，出以謹愼態度，雖令人驚異，甚至警告謂外長會議，根本將無公報發表，惟外長會議至少對於巴爾幹條約之協定，產生一顯著結果。三國外次即將在倫敦重行工作，討論羅保匈芬各國和約之草約。本年十月間倫敦五國外長會議即因此項問題，而告擱淺。今後四個月或不足四個月內，約在一九四六年五月一日以前，凡參加歐戰之各國，將舉行二次世界大戰第一次和平會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿五日電〕今日據權威方面稱：美國務卿貝爾納斯對於三外長會議成績頗表欣慰，若干爭持未決之問題，均已成立具體協定。華盛頓方面更　此次會議之成就，實遠過於所期望者。據消息　通方面稱，蘇聯仍未獲得原子秘密，但聞三外長在會議中曾依據美英加三言國宣，討論世界各國共管原子能問題。</p>
<p>召開和平會議我國已表同意</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科二十六日電〕據悉，中國已同意三強之提議，即中國列爲五邀請國之一，邀請二十一個聯合國家，於三强準備擬定之條約草稿完成後，即舉行聯合國和平會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十六日電〕三强外長會議中直接影響中法兩國利益之事件，均曾通知兩國大使，聞中國政府對於第一公報所建議之事項，已表示同意，美方消息謂法國尙未表示同意，但亦未表示反對。又據本社外交記者稱，英國羣衆，深盼莫斯科會議，對於原子能之控制，能有所決議，俾使明年一月十日召開之聯合國機構大會，得以順利進行，此間咸認會議之成敗，可以此事作爲「酸性試驗」。然原子能之決議乃信任問題，故必須先有各國在其他方面之合作。職是之故，莫斯科會議之第一項任務，即爲重樹倫敦外長會議失敗以後之國際合作。此間認爲莫斯科所宣佈之第一次公報，對於原子政策之談話，能產生良好之影響。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科二十五日電〕貝爾納斯貝文及三國代表團之其他人員，均應史達林之邀，赴克里姆林宮耶誕節前夕之宴會，賓主處於熱烈友好之氛圍中。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕今日消息靈通方面相信：有關韓國獨立之計劃，可能在莫斯科外長會議中形成。此等人士指陳，傳美國務卿貝爾納斯赴蘇時携有訓令，敦促立即實現韓國之獨立，反對蘇方託管之主張。但截至目前，尙無三强獲得任何結論之徵象。美國之立塲爲：根據開羅宣言，實允准韓國實行民衆投票，自行選擇政府形式。觀察家指稱，蘇方已建議蘇美佔領區應合併，由一國擔任託管，在舉行民衆投票前之某一規定時期中，使南方肥沃之農田與北方之工業發生聯繫。但在目前，北緯三十八度使韓國分裂爲二，蘇方以爲如此種界限編續存在，實行全國民衆投票殆不可能。</p>

<p>三強一度起爭執</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿六日電〕紐約泰晤士報華盛頓訪員稱：關於英自治領參加和平太會之事，曾在莫斯科發生一度爭執，蘇聯立塲堅決，謂澳大利亞·加拿大·南菲及紐西蘭，並非獨立國，應由英國代表出席和會。英外相貝文及美國務卿則竭力反對，謂愛爾蘭亦屬英國之自治領，固始終以獨立之姿熊未曾參戰。蘇聯繼又駁稱，如英國之自治領及印度可以參加，則每一蘇維埃共和國均應有參加之權。美國務卿貝爾納斯即謂如蘇聯堅持須得六票，則美國之四十八州，每州亦應有一票，結果乃決定妥協辦法，凡以軍隊積極參戰之國，均得參加和會。（按此項消息，尙未能經英美官方證實）</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕英官方昨證實印度亦得參加對德國衛星國議和之第二階段。根據莫斯科電台星期一廣播，五强外長所起草之和平條約，將交各積極交戰國討論，印度旣爲聯合國之一，自當參加聯合國全體會員國討論和約之會議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京二十六日電〕日本前宮內省大臣牧野伯，現年七十有四，瑩居束京近郊幽僻小莊，足不出戶，據日本消息靈通方面言：牧野昔日曾爲軍閥所迫而下野，今則重握實權，儼然爲日本戰敗後之「西園寺」。日皇裕仁於日軍全面屈服後，曾一度有遜位之意，即爲收野所阻而作罷。此後裕仁退位之議，　不以牧　反對而消　於無　。各國記者　欲　　，每以牧野年　參　不問時事而　　，　　　人員代爲傳　意見於日　之　　，　限　　　　　　　十年前，　之爲「危險　自由主義派」，今日復爲裕仁寵信者，推厥原因，無非由於三任首相之近衛已服毒自盡，日皇戰時左右親信，多由麥帥指令投置監獄，牧野乃爲碩果僅存之元老，世事變遷，宦海升沉，原無足奇。牧野一派新勢力，其中所包羅之份子可得而言者，有現任首相幣原（年七十三歲），退任海軍上將現任樞密院長鈴木（年七十八歲），現任外相吉由（年六十七歲），前任內務省大臣松平（年六十八歲），此等人物，即日本軍閣所目爲自由主義派者，然若　之自由主義不過爲時代落伍之古董，與日本今日所遭遇之大　遷，尙格格不相入。牧野於一九二五年任宮內省大臣十年之久，事前且任內　府大臣四年，故　裕仁　　　　時則　　　　。遠近衛回憶錄所載：日皇於太平洋戰爭爆發前，未能積極干政，實出於牧野之一言喪邦。蓋牧野曾密告裕仁，於政治外交，母多出主意也。近衛並謂：牧野主張日本憲法應倣英制。一九三五年十二月二十六日，牧野因不敵軍閥氣勢，宣告下野，其繼任齋籐，即於翌年「二二六事變」被殺。木戶侯告聯合社記者：「牧野曾以反對參謀本部危險爲言」，卒亦無可如何，今年夏，日本大勢已去，乃由鈴木出任首相，旋即接受波茨坦宣言，宣告投降。吉田係牧野東床快婿。東久邇宮組閣，即以吉田爲外相。向恃近衛爲後盾之重光葵，名落深山。幣原旋出而改組內閣，吉田蟬聯，則牧野之勢力，可想而知。松平爲裕仁長兄秩父宮之　丈，曾於一九三六年至一九四五年任內務府大臣且曾出使英國，歷次出席國際會議，以日本優秀外交家見稱於時。今年三月十日以皇宮被炸焚燬，引咎辭職。凡此人的關係以及過去因緣，在日本非常重要，亦爲構成日皇左右一種新勢力之要素。此外尙有一要人，即退任海軍大將岡田是也。岡田現年七十八歲。曾一度任曾相，亦即「二二六事變」之攻擊目標。用計脫身後，即隱居不出，在戰敗時再得日皇親任，以吉田爲「信差」，此一新勢力，與牧野數度交換意見，乃決定推幣原爲言相。現據未證實消息：此一新勢力已決定以松平爲未來首相，幣原已表示，下屆選舉結果，現內閣如不足以代表民意，自富退避賢路，由多　黨組閣。惟在目下幣原內閣　將　爲過渡，其使命係在宣傳「保守性的自由主義」，　以保留皇位爲　　。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎廿六日電〕官方昨正式宣布：法國法郞之新匯率，規定爲四八〇法郞易英金一鎊，美金一元可易一一九·一法郞。原有之滙率爲英金一鎊易二〇〇法郞，自上次大戰以來，法郞已貶値六次。新匯率之規定，使法郞之金價値，僅及一九二八年法郎之十分之一。昨日法國若干晨報謂政府有徽用外國資本之意，所擬徵用者爲外國貨幣，外國股票之股息，國外之外國股票及國內法國人所持有之外國股票。政府擴先徵用前三類，對於第四類之辦法尙未決定。又據本社財政記者稱，聖　節世界各市塲均在休息之際，乘此機會宣布法郞之貶値，實至爲適宜。法國之物價及工資均有增加，故二百對一之舊匯率，實已不切實用，使法國之出口貨過於昂貴，形成輸入遠超輸出之局面，因此法國已向英格蘭銀行負欠大宗之債務。四八〇對一之新滙率，在倫敦意料之中，非正式方面消息且謂，英政府於上星期末以前，即已表示同意。若干巴黎來電謂，由於共黨之壓力，法國常局擬先將法郎貶値至三五〇對一，惟以形勢之變化，故始決定一舉即貶爲匹八〇對一，英方認爲此乃智者之舉。至於此次法郞之貶値，是否將影響法郞之信用，當視法人之反響如何而定，如法人認此乃物價及工資提高後合理之對策，則貶值後之法郎，仍可保持穩定，如法人因此再抬高物價，卒又不得不增加工資，則勢必造成更進一步之通貨膨脹。</p>

<h3 id="c50">美國飛彈「蝙蝠」秘密性公開透露　本報編譯室特譯稿 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>美海軍機用雷達對準數里外遠距離目標投擲的飛彈，在戰爭最後一年內，曾擊毁了許多日本戰艦和商船，漢海軍最近透露了這一個消息。</p>
<p>這是戰爭中各國第一次操縱成功的自動操縱投彈器。這一向嚴守着的戰時秘密武義取各「蝙蝠」，眞的，蝙蝠飛行時，發出一陣急促的聲浪波動，它就靠這聲波的回聲，指示自己應取的方向。飛彈的直趨轟炸目標，也是靠雷達的回聲自動調整方向的，所以便呌它「蝙蝠」。</p>
<p>較日本「肉彈」厲害</p>
<p>「蝙蝠」飛彈的自導器，比它的對手，日本神風特攻隊裏的肉彈人類瞄手屬害得多，它可在任何視綫條件之下，看見它的目標，它的反應，也比較快。它所佔的空間，比日本的肉彈小，而且從不「失風」，這種雷達自導器的技巧靈活，早在工廠內與炸彈同時配製在一起。</p>
<p>飛彈「蝙蝠」，由海軍巡邏轟炸機遠在被炸目標的防禦高射砲火網以外，投向目標，一經脫離母機，它便會完全變成自動，目標船的任何規避動作，都逃不出它的控制。它的高速度和小體積，簡直使日本的高射砲手莫知莫覺。海軍巡邏機每張機　下，都配有「蝙蝠」一顆。</p>
<p>海軍少將普拉埃斯率領的第一「飛翼」隊，曾在太平洋前綫，用「蝙蝠」轟炸日軍海上及地面目標，得到很大的效果。</p>
<p>使用飛彈的例子</p>
<p>舉一例子：有兩架飛機同時用雷達發現廿哩以外的敵艦，它們飛近一看，知是日本的驅逐艦，艦上的高射砲火很熾烈，當兩機飛出火網以外後，日軍即停止射擊，那時，其中一架立即放出它的「蝙蝠」飛彈，在天空中迅疾降下，直趨驅逐艦，瞬即炸毁它的船首，另一驅逐艦馬上駛近搭救，並對投擲飛彈的母機拚侖射擊，但此母機早就飛往火綱以外去了。</p>
<p>使用「蝙蝠」是相當簡單的一種手續。母機的駕駛員，祗消找到它的目標，便瞄準它所要攻擊的船隻，然後撳動機鈕，將飛彈放出，就完事。這被放投的飛彈，會自動直趨它的目標，即使它的目標是一羣火的護航隊，亦復如此。投彈的母機，照樣可隨駕駛員的意向自由前進。</p>
<p>不受氣候的影響</p>
<p>在任何氣候之下，不分晝夜，飛彈都可投擲，不過目標是要確實認淸楚的。因爲它的目導器，是不能辨別敵友的。</p>
<p>這種雷達自導的飛彈，身長約十二英尺，翼部長十英尺，內部裝滿爆炸物，它的飛行速度，和飛機差不多。它的著彈距離之遠大，足使母機在敵人最大高射砲火網之外活動裕如。</p>
<p>老式投摔法，往往因爲目標距離之越遠而越失其正確性，所以在萬射砲火　外投彈投準的百分比是很徵些的。可是「蝙蝠」的高度正確性，並不受距離的影響。</p>
<p>事實證明：日本人始終不懂得飛彈的性質，因爲它總在日軍以爲已在著彈距離之外被投準目標，事先一些沒有什麼足以視爲警告的情形從母機上發出，即使有，也很微細。這種秘密武器的用途透露後，美海軍軍械局長赫爾賽海軍少將宣稱：「雖然它用法的原則，可以用在將來別種武器上，現在却已被認爲廢置不必用了。」</p>
<p>飛彈的製造成功</p>
<p>在一九四二年，日本組織神風特別攻擊隊或採取肉彈辦法之前，美海軍軍械局便向科學研究社要求探尋可以自找目標，用雷達自動操縱的飛彈製造方案，這一計劃的發起人是海軍上尉德克。</p>
<p>這種複雜武器製造成功，是許多專家密切合作的結果。全國度量衡局的德拉埃鄧博士，襄助技術部份工作，軍械局德克上尉和太保中校，綜合軍事方面的工作，雷達自導器是下列各單位專家合作成績，史帶脫博士及拉姆主持下的麻省工專，劍橋工專等科學家，綠棗斯主持的員　電　　騐所內的科學家們，　量　局　埃特和克拉　司達博士，從事於氣體力學上的研究，和安定性上的樣討。航空局海軍少校麥克拉金，則監督試飛工作。</p>

<p>一九四一年夏間，某日午後，美軍舉行實地演習。一位砲兵連連長，在一棵大樹下，發現了一個理想的野戰砲砲位。然而爲了設置砲位，砲前那棵樹須鋸去兩條樹枝，而軍部又有未得物主許可，不可自擅自損害民物的禁令。這樣，那位砲兵連長。在盛怒下，也祗好先設法徵得物主的同意，設置砲位的時間，也就因之延宕了好幾個鐘頭。</p>
<p>不久以後，一位目擊這次演習的新聞記者，邀准訪問美陸軍參謀總長馬歇爾將軍。那位新聞記者，在晤談間，提起這椿事，並問他：「爲什麼各部隊不暫時不願一切必要的損失，直截爽快地幹下去，而在事後賠償物主的損失呢？假如各部要顧及農夫的樹，美軍又怎樣能作戰呢？」</p>
<p>馬歡爾將軍，以和觀友　的眼光，看看那位記者，他說；「那　幹，對迅速軍事行動一事，將有很大的助益。」並說：「無疑地號軍全然那麼幹。」可是他又說：「美國是個民主國，因此人民也就有某些法定的樣利。無論如何，美軍應支持這些權利，並遵免損書人民的利益。」馬歇爾將　覺得演習上短暫的延宕，正是維護美國建國大原則的小小代價。</p>
<p>深知馬歇爾將軍的人，就曉得他的成功秘訣，並不在於軍事才能。他雖然富於軍事才幹，他的成功却在於他有眞正的民主感。</p>

<p>在甘肅省內皚皚白雪的祁連山下，有一座小城，名呌「三潭」（譯音）就在那三潭城南門外山脚邊，埋着一堆磚砌的靑塚，裹面長眠着一位名呌奧爾威恩霍格在中國永不會被人們遺忘的英國人，他便是本文的主人翁。</p>
<p>中國有很多外國友人，可是沒有像他那樣能深入於民間生活的，他能說中國話，他和中國人一起吃苦，一起工作，他被當作自己人一樣看待。</p>
<p>霍格先生　來華經過情形</p>
<p>他來到中國，是在中日事變不久後一九三七年，那時，他是英國新聞處的特派通訊員。一九三八年十月，漢口淪陷，他便留在淪陷區，後來到北平觀察所謂「東亞新秩序」，此後又同一羣學生離開北平，在西南兩方遊擊區躭擱了一年，從那時起，他對中國人民更深一層認識，他能同當地人一樣講中國話，唱愛國歌與合唱曲。</p>
<p>他聽說中國工業合作社辦理成功，便又開始旅行，想去找些工作做。他費了八個月功夫，跑了六百公里以上的路程，終於到達寳鷄，他在陝西一所茅屋內住了許久，於是得了副傷寒。</p>
<p>赴寶雞縣　展開工業合作</p>
<p>寶鷄是西北方面中國工業合作社的總社所在地。中國這許多省份內的合作運動，都是從那裏發揚滋長的。在那裏，他看見了該社的工作，工業，醫院和學校。</p>
<p>「軍事第一」，「勝利第一」，和「經濟建設必須適應於國家之需要」等原則，都已付諸實行。難民都在新的生活方法下生活，他們都用工作來養活自己，因爲他們在供應軍隊和民衆的需要上也有份，所以也在抗戰中盡他們一份力量，霍格在那裏變得異常的熱誠。</p>
<p>他就此不到重慶去找工作，在拉浦伍特敎授介紹之下，他担任了該社分社的第一個英人秘書，他工作很勤勞，時常往來於各合作社中心區，編寫報告，描摹工人們克服困難的成功。在此中國工業合作社勇敢任職時期內，他對海外的通訊社供給了第一流的新聞宣傳資料。</p>
<p>創辦工專　訓練技術人員</p>
<p>他逐漸對貝里工專的工作又發生了興趣，孩子們在工專裏被訓練成各式各樣工業合作社的技術人員。在一九四二年，他便執敎鞭於雙十坡貝立工專，像他那樣一個牛津大學的畢業生，論資格，論經騐，他在敎學方面是綽綽有餘的。</p>
<p>在貝立工專裏，學生和教職員們，都有意識地向一個新的革命性的敎育目標共同工作着。勞工或農夫們的子弟們，在那裏受的專門敎育，全以學業與技術並重的實習爲基本工作。</p>
<p>敎職員和學生住在一起，學生做的事情，他們也做，如此辦法，則團體精神和忠實，就藉此培養成功。爲實行自治紀律起見，學生們都有團體組織，並爲鼓勵「競賽」起見，對於淸潔，守時，和服從等簡單的基本美德，都有獎勵·霍格很愛好這種生活，他毫不疲倦地爲孩子們的福利工作着，他開始瞭解他們的背景和他們的種種問題，所以孩子們都當他好友看待，他到底榮任了他們的校長。</p>
<p>越青嶺山　奔跑一百公里</p>
<p>一九四二年，當他初長該校的時期，曾受到不少挫折。招請適當的敎職員，不是容易的事情。要使年紀較長的孩子們產生眞正的責任心，需要相當的時間。但是他從不灰心，他反而較以前更加努力刻苦。終於達到威功的目的·在夏季爲參加「大城」內舉行的合作日，他率領全校學生越過靑嶺山，走了一百公里的路程。此舉使鄕下的孩子們增進不少見識，因爲那裏有許多孩子們，搭火車還是第一次呢。</p>
<p>常他們這一批回到雙十坡山脚邊，遠遠望見校門時，不斷的歡呼，使霍格初次發現他成功的曙光。這正證明了學生們對於母校的驕傲和摯愛。在他主持之下，學校一天比一天發達起來，他組織勞工隊，修築道路，建造橋樣，更完成一所達樂廣塲。新的房子也建築起來了，成千累萬的磚瓦，都是學生們搬運的，而這些工作，又都是利用空閒時間完成的。</p>
<p>被迫遷校　染　傷風長逝</p>
<p>當日軍向陝西推進時，該校決定撤退到三潭去，霍格對於這一次遷移是否合宜，表示懷疑，可是他還是以他一向的堅定和熱望，應付當時的局勢。到了三潭，他在打破記錄的短促時間內，建立了新的校址。他又計劃着暑假工作和運動節目。此後他想到蘭州去跑一躺，帶回幾個重要人員，可惜這計劃沒有走成功。在學校遷移期間，脚上偶然受了傷，竟變成破傷風。人們在無綫電裏，電報裏，到處尋求可以治療破傷風的血淸，但已來不及。霍格終於一九四五年的七月二十二日與世長逝。</p>
<p>十六個學生扶着他的靈柩，上面蓋着一幅學生們自製的大校旗旗上寫着全體學生的姓名，藉以紀念「他們可愛的老師」。葬儀完畢後，一個孩子問道：「英國在那一方向」？間淸楚後，他便決定對他老師的父母行禮致敬。</p>
<p>蓋棺論定　垂令名不於朽</p>
<p>我們對於這位曾與中國人在一起生活的英國人表示非常惋惜。他的去世，實在是中國工業合作社的重大損失。在一小頁的紙上，他寫着最後幾個字：「我的一切給與貝里學校」。他生前沒有看到勝利與解放，但他在中國人民黑暗時代所做的工作，將永遠在戰後建設年代永生着。我們永遠紀着霍格，他是國際友愛和合作最完美的一個榜樣。（本報編譯室譯）</p>
<p>熱情磅礴迎盟友</p>
<p>（左圖）美軍陸虞隊第一師團入塘沽畔，當地人民即熱烈歡迎，舉行「高曉」表演，以　盟友。此種類似跳舞之「高曉」表演，平時衹在新年中舉行·左角戴鋼盔者爲美國兵士，中美國旗，相輿輝映，充分表現了中美合作之熱情。</p>
<p>首都歡　聖誕節之夜</p>

<h3 id="c53">馬帥在陪都　國賓受迎空前一幕 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 庸人寄自重慶</p>
<p>八年以來，在反侵略反帝國主義的同一戰綫之下，把中美兩國友誼的傳統基礎，更見得擴大而鞏固了。無怪這次美國駐華特使馬歇爾元帥的飛臨陪都，趕到遠離山城的　白市驛機塲去歡迎的人員，除了政府軍政代表以外，還有各階層的代表，以及馬帥的僚友們，總計在塲的歡迎人員，無慮千人以上。儀式的隆重，熟情的流露，正表示着我們迎接國賓的空前一幕。</p>
<p>銀色巨機　衝破浮空</p>
<p>十二時十五分鐘，銀色巨機衝破浮空的雲層，邁向市空飛去，這是獻給國賓臨空欣賞我們抗戰聖城雄姿的一個機會。中國在這樣一個祟山峻嶺，交通閉塞的環境裏，能够抵抗强暴而不屈，就是我們偉大領袖英明決策的結果。</p>
<p>當飛機繞市三匝以後，折向機塲飛來，把寗靜的空氣，頓時緊張嚴肅起來，美國憲兵們在熟練的技術之下，把纜繩作了圍牆，王秘書長寵惠，鼻架深度近視鏡，身穿藍抱馬褂，被美國憲兵們看作鄉下土老兒，準備挾之而去，幸經旁人發現，向前解釋，始得進入纜圈。</p>
<p>開麥拉聲　猶如機槍演習</p>
<p>十二時二十五分，這架C45號巨型機降落妥當，馬歇爾特使從互機腹下展露了出來，中外攝影記者，得到優先權利，紛紛爭取鏡頭，一時開麥拉之聲大作，擦擦然不絕於耳，有如機槍演習。藍達爾少將身段輕快，首先趨前致敬，宋子文院長，繼之趨前握手寒喧，樂隊起奏美我國歌，馬帥肅立示敬，隨即由宋院長介紹歡迎人員，馬帥一一握手示謝。</p>
<p>機塲人潮　隨馬帥而展動</p>
<p>馬帥身材頗長，膚色紅潤，儀容嚴肅，精神飽滿，看不出有些些風塵。足登紫色皮鞋，手握醬色手套，身穿米黃色大衣，肩綴五星銀章，一望而知他是一個偉大軍人——在大戰時期運籌決策立了豐功偉績的參謀總長。</p>
<p>他檢閱儀仗隊時，曾面露笑容，走向隊長跟前，拉手道謝，表示他的滿意。於是機塲人浪，也隨着馬帥的行步而展動，而馬帥始終表示緘默，不願發表任何談話，這是充份表現了這位肩荷重命的國賓之沉默的個性。</p>
<p>龐大轎車　插五星元帥旗</p>
<p>最後，地同藍達爾少將，稍立塲角，瞭望着機塲的景色，這片刻的瞭望，在他的心底裏，可能展開了大中國現狀及前途的一幅。我國要從分割狀態下統一起來，强大起來。宋院長是招待國賓的首席，他迎着馬帥登上上插五星元帥旗的龐大轎車，駛向市區去了。</p>
<p>歡迎人員目送着這位國賓遠離機塲，大家在議論着國賓的任務。有些人說：馬帥是美國潘興以下的唯一元帥，所以他此次使華，對中國的前途，必有圓滿的結果。有些人說：今天共產黨也有代表在塲歡迎，這是一個可喜的現象。也有人感慨地說道：家有逆子，敗壞家風，有勞鄰人的勸導，這是可恥的事。我在歸途中，浸沉在他們的各式的議論裏。</p>

<h3 id="c54">我國膺選樞機主敎 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>一昨羅馬電訊，謂敎宗新任樞機主敎卅工人，其中有中國田耕莘主敎一人，亦膺新選，此爲天主敎會史中之創舉。電訊傳來，適値全國歡祝耶誕之日，不論是否爲天主敎信衆，一般都感到欣慰。查樞機主敎，西名爲Cardinal我國俗稱爲紅衣大主敎。除敎宗外，爲天主敎會中最高榮譽職位。天主敎的組織，以羅馬爲宗徒伯多祿舊豁之地，故羅爲敎宗兼羅馬主敎，各地設敎區，每區有主敎，主理敎務，集若干敎區而成爲一宗敎省區者，則有總主敎，爲各該省區主席。在敎務尙未發達的地方，設宗座監牧區或宗座代牧區，派宗座監牧或代牧主理傳敎事務，其授有主敎衛者，亦稱主敎。主理各地天主敎敎務的，就是這些主敎們。在主敎以下，是無量數的天主敎敎士及信衆；在主敎以上，就是在羅馬的敎廷，在羅馬的敎宗（俗稱敎皇）。</p>
<p>敎宗爲全世界四萬萬天主敎信衆精神上的領袖；他爲處理全世界的敎務，需要一般老成持重德行高超的人協助，以備他的諮詢，設樞機院（College　Cardinals），置樞機七十人。所以稱爲樞機的原故，大的是因爲他們參與敎廷中樞的機密。這些樞機的地位，自敎宗以次，要算最爲隆重的了。當敎宗出缺的時候，選舉敎宗的最高權就操在樞機院內的七十位樞機。在樞機院之外，在敎宗之下，爲處理全世界的敎務，還設有十一部，就中敎理部，敎務部，東方敎會部等部部長由敎宗兼攝，餘若傳信部，聖事部等部長均由樞機兼任。由此種種，可知樞機主敎地位之隆重。若就我國政府組織相比，其地位多少有如國民政府委員。今敎宗任命田耕莘主敎爲樞機，實爲國人參加敎廷中樞機密的第一人。我們欣聆此項消息之餘，不免有幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一，敎宗任命田耕莘主敎爲樞機，表示敎宗如何關心中國的敎務。天主敎自明季來華，流傳中國逾三百年。可惜因爲淸初禁敎，以致列强與我訂立不平等條約之際，將傳敎自由亦復旬爲一款，而此後天主敎在華傳敎遂以不平等條約爲憑藉，國人亦多目爲「洋敎」。今不平等條約廢止，傳敎自由固不必再藉條約爲護符，而信仰自由却已明定於國法。國父孫中山先生旣爲基督敎信徒於前，而現政府自蔣主席以次，亦多虔信耶敎的人，對於維護基督敎的傳敎事業，素極關注。聞近年以來，天主敎的敎務漸次發展，已有一百三十餘敎區，內中國主敎亦已有三十餘人，信衆達四百五十萬人，不可謂非有廣大的影響。然與中國人口相衡，爲數其實尙屬有限。今敎宗對於中國敎務旣極關心，我政府對基督敎傳敎事業又備極維護，深願天主敎能在我國繼續發展，俾中國能逐漸成爲一個基督敎信衆日益見多的國家，不負敎宗及我主席的一番期望。</p>
<p>第二，天主敎在全世界有信衆逾四萬萬，這裹面當然有賢與不肯。但這四萬萬人一定不盡是愚蠢無知，其中也有不少傑出的科學家，文學家，乃至政治家。它之能得到這許多人的信奉，當然其中具有深義。我們中國習俗，尤其士大夫們，一向不以宗敎爲重，甚至有人目宗敎爲毒藥，坐是對於基督敎—特別是基督敎的中堅天主敎，往往加以漠視。但我們不可忽略一個事實：即現在這個世界幾乎可說就是基督敎的世界，西方的文明是基督敎的文明，我們實在有多多注意研究基督敎的必要。中國至今還不是基督敎的國家，基督敎信衆在上海市人口中所占的百分比也並不高，然而上海却正度過勝利後第一次愉快的耶誕，無論男女老少，都懷着一種熱烈的情調。我們願大家以同樣的情調去熱烈研究基督敎的眞理。</p>
<p>第三，基督敎信衆不可放棄他們對中國的責任。基督敎信衆在中國全人口的百分比雖不高，然而他們對於中國建國所負的責任却很大。他們應該明白，什麼是橫在建國大道上的障礙，應該如何發揮並運用他們的力量來廓淸或减少這些障礙。就積極方面言，他們應該如何使他們所崇奉的宗敎能爲國人所接納融化，正如明季的上海耆紳徐文定公（光啓）一樣，有所成就，如何推動新風尙，以策動建國艱巨工作中的心理建設，倫理建設，乃至社會建設，政治建設，與經濟建設。基督敎的精神是現世的，戰鬥的，要以這種精神協力於建國的工作。</p>
<p>觀乎田耕莘主敎的被選爲樞機，可見天主敎會之在中國，已漸臻於成年之域。我們不會忘記明末淸初時，天主敎的傳布對於我國文化所起的優良影響。深願今後中國的天主敎信衆，遵照羅馬敎宗此次耶誕獻辭的指示，用合作，善意與互信的精神，在建設新中國和新世界的工作中，能有卓越的貢獻，則敎宗所謂目前僅爲「戰後」而尙無「和平」的世界，必有進入眞正和平之一日。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕三十二年八月間敵僞强迫收買本市紗布，其紗布廠商所出之棧單，至今尚有不少仍在持單人手中，其中分二部份，一爲外商，如怡和，　昌等是，一爲華商，如中紡統益等是，是等廠商所出之棧單，平日本作爲籌碼流通，不必出現貨，其中且有開出遠期棧單，以待陸續補進原料，分期出貨派給者，當時經敵僞之刼收，廠存貨品遭其强迫收買，持單人心有不甘者，並不辦理所謂申請出賣手續，亦不領受價金，則其棧單當然仍在原主手中，且廠商之開出空頭綫單者，根本無貨可資申請出賣，對於持巢人並未逐一催告，因此當時所出之棧單總數，興廠存　貨總數，原難相符，自勝利來臨，敵僞屈膝，怡和綸昌廠存之貨，早已一空，但爲棉布公會方面查得尚有一部份貨品因敵僞之沒收而存在上海，原封未動，該公會已向怡和綸昌等主張權利，並已呈明敵僞產業處理局，請求發還，日來正在公會內設立專處，徵求持單人發記，以備將來勻攤，至於不足部份，且將向該出單廠家要求賠償，至中紡，統益等　商廠家，其持單人亦正在要求公會，分組辦理登記及申請出單廠派貨，該公會整理委員會透露消息，廠家之開出空頭棧單者，根本不容　敵僞收買紗布之機會，朦混過去，表示　　責依法追究云。</p>

<p>晨友盃籃球聯賽，昨午甲組二塲，相當精彩，以故球房內空氣殊稱興旺，晨友盃辦在公開聯賽之前，實一大收獲，茲略叙昨戰簡情：</p>
<p>開塲戲爲協興戰梁溪，兩隊盛名相等，亦爲昨日富有號召力之一役。不料梁溪以楊元龍余郇子之不到，張錦璇之負病登塲，不免驟見實力削减。裁判狄憲章宣鶴皋，協興劉福善首探中的，陳學崇立還顏色，協興再接再厲，黃犬烈妙中再度佔先，但梁溪抱破釜沉舟之決心，哀兵必勝，演出有意外之佳妙。陳學崇射無不中，乃分數異常逼近，局勢亦因此頗見緊凑，上半時協興一七分，梁溪一四分，相差三分。下半時，協興採用車輪戰術，頻頻換人，梁溪欺其陣脚未定，緊逼不已，追至廿六對廿二時，協興用最理想陣容，於是又得節節佔導。終以三七對二四壓退梁溪，有季軍之希望矣。</p>
<p>第二役爲當勝軍華聯對晨友，勝負之判，早在意中，上塲之初，晨友姚文彝，梁永佳連珠頻獲，瞬間以五對二佔先，此爲昨日晨友之黃金時代。此後華聯孔廣益吳成章均見獲中，晨友抬頭無機，上半時十三對五華聯居上，休息後，易邊再戰。華聯更見順手，晨友一瀉千里，頃刻間，華聯以二三對五佔絕對優勢，華聯乃大事調動生力軍，依然聲勢赫赫，晨友士無鬥志，完　時華聯以四十二對一七獲得勝利，保持六戰六勝之偉績。</p>
<p>又今日有乙組四塲秩序錄下：</p>
<p>鷲隊—慧星（盃部）五時卅分</p>
<p>晨黃—華南（盃部）六時一刻</p>
<p>晨紅—友愛（晨部）七時正</p>

<p>— 金光</p>
<p>假使每個人都不能否認敎員也是要喫飯的，要養家活口的，那末，您什麽理由，敎員的待遇——　報應是特別的低賤呢？</p>
<p>近日去應徵一個敎員的位置，很順利的一談就成功了。功課是擔任初中一的國文，小學六年級的國文，歷史，自然，每週上課一千一百分鐘，台二十二二節，這就是說，每日大的要有四個鐘點在敎室內呌跳。待遇是按月五十萬僞幣，供給中膳一頓。地區是在海格路××中小學。　筆者曾又詢及該校的學生數，據答，中一的一班是四十六人，六年級是三十九人。不含糊的說話，我已經可以知道，用最快的速率，批改該二班的課卷與作文卷，至少每日再得費去二三個鐘點，那末，這很明顯，我整個白天的時間是完全交代給這學校了。</p>
<p>不很斯文的講法，我的每日的時間就是給僞幣五十萬元（事業上還須打去二成的電車費，祇能說是四十萬，）與一餐中膳所出賣了。我丟棄一切家中人的生活于不顧，我是否可以僅以五十萬元僞幣來餵飽我其餘的二餐呢？——說來這話是多麼慚愧，現在市上小館子中最低的客飯是法幣一百五十元（小帳另加），每月三十次就得法幣四千五百元，以僞幣來說，就是九十萬！但是我們就憑小館子無論如何總要謙點錢，自己家庭中燒來喫總可便宜些的說法來說，就將這一個數目打個對折，也得四十五萬元。那末其除的五萬元僞幣又將如何來分配三十次的早餐呢？</p>
<p>昨日正好遇見一個已在某小商店做職員的學生，問起他最近工作的狀祝，最後又問及待遇，待遇這一方的圓答說是店方供給一日三餐外，薪津是每月法幣一萬五千元——我不禁要脫口高呼；這是我的慚愧，還是堂堂　着敎育牌子者的慚愧呢？</p>
<p>這次我是次計預備總換我的求生方向了——我可以告訴大家的，在敎書生涯中，我已度過了五年——這與其說是我的不够淸高，卅寗說是在敎育無理待遇的摧殘下的必然後果！</p>
<p>而且我也不願再受一般「假冒爲善」的「敎育者」的層層剝削了。學校的收費並不低康呀！</p>

<h3 id="c90">高等法庭刑庭　續審漢奸　顧林兩逆猶圖狡辯脫罪 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午十時，提籃橋上海監獄高等法院第一刑庭在曹推事駿主持下，開漢奸調查庭二起，即〔翻譯〕顧友棠之代　華工案，及〔翻譯〕林之興之欺壓勒索案。二被告均延請律師辯護，院方所傳之諸證人，亦準時到庭作證。</p>
<p>為敵張目招募華工</p>
<p>翻譯顧友棠，年三十七歲，寗波人。前曾於民國十五年間僑居日本，業廚司，諳通日語。於民國二十六年九月圓滬，旋即返鄕。二十七年夏季，以買賣草蓆為生，二十八年四月間，由日人吉村和生之介紹，進入日商三菱洋行管理之〔江南造船廠浦東分廠〕棧房間工作，後充任該廠翻譯。民國卅二年四月間，〔三菱洋行〕受日方之委託，招募華工赴新加坡作工，由該廠工頭陳水堯出面，向受騙華工訂有合同，言明以一年為期，是時受騙華工達二百餘人之譜。當「招募」工人及「慰撫」工人家屬時，均由顧友棠任翻譯。刻下該批華工尚無書信。本案經高檢處調查確實後，於昨日再度開審。證人張阿鳳·金杜氏·報到證明，告訴彼等丈夫於前年六月受騙離滬，迄今下落不明。詢及被告則謂祇任通譯之職，與招騙華工無關，且於本年五月間已辭職。至十一時後，庭　將顧還押，改期再審。顧之被捕經過如下：今年八月間，日本投降後，受騙工人家屬多名，擁向陳水堯家要人，因陳奸狡善變，業已逃之夭夭，於是尋至顧友棠家，當時與顧發生衝突，遂為警察發覺，帶至警局，後即移解法院。</p>
<p>欺壓鄕民慣施敲詐</p>
<p>繼詢林之興年四十六歲，　州人，曾在日本業理髪匠多年，於本年二月間充任真茹日本「憲兵隊」翻譯。　藉日軍惡勢力，欺壓鄕民，對鎭上米商慣施敲詐手段。高檢處林檢察偵查本案，業已結束，依法提起公訴。起訴要旨略謂：被告利用在日軍機關供職之惡勢，向眞茹米商仲紀奎張行勒索其所得盈餘。更於本年七月六日，因勒索未遂，竟夥同「憲兵隊」情報員沈阿金·梁秉衍·信李全根·等將仲辱毆，自應認為有犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第八款通謀敵團，充任有關軍事之職役罪。，及刑法第五十五條，依勢勒索恐嚇取財罪，因之提起公訴云云。繼曹推事詢及林逆，而林逆對此項勒索，諉稱係「酬謝」，告訴人仲紀奎當庭評述經過，并謂果係「酬謝」性質，當出於本人之自願，何致復行扭警訴究？至十一時三刻，庭諭本案尚待合議，候改期再訊。</p>

<p>行政院善後救濟總署編譯處於昨日下午三時，在該署二樓，招待本市新聞界，報告該署成立經過及已到華之救濟物資數量及其支配情形。到各報社記者四十餘人，由編譯處長沈惟泰主席，沈氏首先報告聯合國善後救濟總署之組織內容與其職資範圍，次述該署之性質與其職權其地位與行政院所屬合部院相等。</p>
<p>〔聯總〕（聯合國善後救濟總署）物資運華後，由該署接收，在中國區內之一切救濟事宜，全部由該署負責辦理，聯合國在華所設之救濟總處則僅處於諮詢及協助之地位。此外該署并聘請有許多外籍專家，以協助各部門之技術工作。</p>
<p>總署下設四廳四處</p>
<p>該署下設四廳四處，四廳為儲運·分配·財務·振卹，四處為調查·編譯·總務·會計另并設有衛生委員會。在全國收復區內，則成立有十五個救濟分署，上海分署即為其中之一，負責處理各地之救濟事宜。關於物資出售，則由財務廳執掌，但分配於各分署之物資，亦可由分署出售，但必須經財務廳尤許，并派員監督，該署原疫重慶，現因國府將遠都南京，故燫將隨同遷京，一部份人員現已到達遠南京，惟上海為該署業務中心，聯合國大部物資均將在上海卸落，故各部門業務，亦將移上海辦理，該署上海辦事處，即為統籌全國性的救濟業務。</p>
<p>運滬物資共九萬噸</p>
<p>迄至目前為止，聯合國救濟總署運送救濟物資來華船隻，已到達上海者有十三艘，其中十一艘之物資，已全部卸落，一艘則正在卸落中，現已卸落之物資，共有九萬噸，其種類數量如下：（一）糧食五萬七千六百六十九噸，其中包括有小麥三七一八四噸，麺粉二八七八七袋，又一二七三八噸，定量營養口糧一一五四五箱，粗奶粉四〇五〇箱，細奶粉六一五〇箱，乾豆三一二四箱，（二）衣服：舊衣八七〇六八包，舊鞋八九〇五包，手套六〇〇綑，棉花四四九五袋，針一箱，綫九袋，（三）建築材料：洋灰八一噸，（四）醫學衛生器材，共二一五噸，其中包括有DDT一〇〇噸，醫藥器材六五噸，盤尼西林〇·〇四噸，牛奶及奶粉五十噸，（五）交通器材，共二二五二噸，及車輛五六六輛，（六）農業器材：殺虫劑及殺菌劑八六四筒，獸醫器材三箱，（七）漁業器材，冷藏機四九座，麻繩一九〇二卷，（八）工礦器材，鋼骨八二噸，凈氣機六〇噸，（九）水利器材二六六噸，（十）福利器材及雜項文：具一八八噸，科學儀器等四七箱。</p>
<p>救濟物資分配情形</p>
<p>上項救濟物資由該署接收後，已分別分配至各分署各機關施用救濟，其分配量及種類如下：（一）食糧分配往華北者一九二八噸，華中七二七七噸，華南六五二七噸，賬卹應三九九噸，財務應二三五八四噸，衛生署七五六噸，聯總八噸，（二）衣服：分配往華北者有舊衣七四〇〇〇包，舊鞋四五〇〇包，針一箱，綫九袋。華中有舊衣一〇〇六八包，鞋二五〇〇包，手套一〇五〇包，華南有舊衣三〇〇〇包，鞋一五〇〇包，棉花四四九五袋，其他地處尚在分配中，（三）建築材料，洋灰全部配交財務廳，（四）醫藥方面，牛奶奶粉五〇噸，已分發往十二個省份衛生機構施用，DDT現尚未分發，器材六五噸，則現在「聯總」尚未分至「該署」，（五）交通器材，車輛分配至華北者有七〇輛，華中一四九輛，華南一三三輛，儲運廳三八輛，財務廳四輛，交通部六九輛，「聯總」七六輛，交通器材分配華中者三〇〇噸，財務廳一八三噸，交通部一六〇二噸，農林部二〇噸，「聯總」一二一噸，尚有二六噸，在分配中，（六）農業器材，及（七）漁業器材統交農林部，（八）工礦器材鋼管統交財務廳，凈氣機在分配中，（九）水利器材配交水利委員會者，有一七三噸，財務廳九三噸，（十）文具配交財務廳者七八噸，「聯總」五四噸，尚在「聯總」未交到一箱在分配中。</p>
<p>剩餘物資亦予分配</p>
<p>此外美軍存留於昆明·貴陽·芷江·柳州之物資中，有醫藥器材二〇〇〇噸，現業由「該署」接收，分配與廣西河南兩分署及雲南貴州四川各地衛生機關醫院應用，凡接受配給醫藥器材之各地醫院，則必須遵守「該署」所規定之下列三原則：對緊急救濟醫治之病　人，完全免費，（二）防疫完全免費，（三）對一般病人應設有百分之十免費治療額。</p>
<p>善後救濟打成一片</p>
<p>沈氏最後稱：聯總供給中國之物資，其中　除一部份施送難民外，一部份則公開出售，以調整市場供給，使一般不需要直接救濟，而有購買力之人民，得以在市上購得其所需之物資，且可防止物價無理上漲，但「該署」之出售物資，不能即因而視之為商業機構，蓋「該署」係在不影響市場，暨不阻碍農工業生產，及國內外通商之原則下，且協助培養農工商業之恢復，如此次上海紡織業之復工，「該署」即以大量羊毛棉花供應協助其迅速復員。至該項物資售得之款項，則將仍用於收復區內之各項緊急救濟事業，聯合國運華救濟物資，約總值美金九四五〇〇萬元。全國平均每人僅得美金二元之物資，故「該署」計劃將此物資及所售得之款項，儘量用到善後積極救濟工作上去，對救濟難民方面，決將施行以工代賬，使需救濟者，修理公路房屋等等，將善後及救濟打成一片，對社會旣可存一永久之貢獻，而被救濟者，可獲得工作，而衣食住亦因而可全部解決矣。</p>

<p>次由上海分署王副署長人麟購述上海分署之組織與工作情形，據稱上海分署之立場與其他各分署同，所支配之物資，亦由總署分派，但上海乃一大港口，各種救濟物資，均在上海接收，然後分發到各分署，（甲）自設立以來，上海分署所受到之救濟品如下：（一）憶接收到者，麺粉四千四百噸，丙種軍用食糧八千五百廿一箱，牛肉三百廿七箱，各種罐頭水果二百廿七箱，舊衣三千包，舊鞋一千五百包，盤尼西林二百瓶，（二）正在接收之物資，有通心粉四百四十九箱，鷄蛋　二百箱，乾豆一千五百六十四箱，卡車二十輛，職員客車六輛，手套二百捆，以上各物資之處理，（即已交到各團體者）分配如下：麺粉二萬五千五百七十六袋，丙種食糧七四六五箱，舊衣六〇三包，盤尼西林三八瓶。</p>

<h3 id="c106">誰維持劇場秩序？ <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 君羊</p>
<p>到上海的第三天，去　華戲院看少年遊。戲開幕之前，鄰座發生了爭執。原因是有兩位沒有符號的軍人强佔了座位，可是那兩個座位已經賣出去了，兩位女太太手裏拿着兩張票子躱在墻角裏看劇場裏管前台的和這兩位同志「交涉」。好話說上一大堆，只求他們調兩個位子看戲，但是道兩位同志只是死坐着不動。結果惹怒了旁邊一位看客，挿話說軍人不該不守秩序。於是兩位同志勃然大怒，萬聲問：「你是哪裏的？」那人也不示弱，自承是×××軍的。那兩位同志更加激怒，連呼「×××軍的也管不了我！誰也管不了我！」一時滿塲騷然，好些看客紛紛離席避去。結果還是劇塲老板磕頭作揖，答應明晚照留這兩個座位，請他們看戲，兩位同志才悻悻然而去。我看了很有點惶惑，但是陪我去看戲的老住上海的表兄說：「這很平常，自從勝利以後，一直就是這種樣子。」</p>
<p>大前天遇見某大戲院的經理他說預備辭職不幹了。我問他爲什麼，他說主要的倒是『近來前台簡直沒法子應付。」</p>
<p>「你是說看白戲的太了嗎？」我問他。</p>
<p>「是呀，有符號的要簽票，沒符號的也要簽票，一個應付不好就動手！實在吃不消。」</p>
<p>昨天中央文化運動委員會召集戲劇電影協會籌備會，素來遵　時間的　仲　先生這次居然晚到了一個鐘頭。一進門我們就看出他那付一向平靜恬適的臉上堆滿了憤慨。「我挨打了，」他說。</p>
<p>詳情是這樣：有幾個憲兵到虹口勝利劇院要進去看戲，因爲前台攔阻發生了爭執。劇院的人只好把經理顧先生請了出來。顧先生於是很客氣地把幾位武奘同志請到樓上經理室去，預備把理由申述淸楚。不意他的第一句話：「我們大家都是中國人」就觸惱了幾位同志，不分靑紅皂白，就賞了顧先生幾個巴掌。幸而被人拉勸開來，這幾位同志才揚言着「明天來打劇塲」而散。可憐顧先生一腔好意，只是想說「我們都是中國人有話大家好商量，犯不上吵給日本僑民看」，竟遭了這一頓侮辱！</p>
<p>我們的軍人的確太缺少娛樂的機會了，營部裏簡直沒有戲聽，沒有電影看，於是只好任其到外面各劇塲去自尋娛樂。不過即使如此，似乎也應該經過一些接洽，用正式的手續，請劇院或演招待塲或發贈券，不該自由出入，使劇塲秩序無法維持，更不能出手傷人。即使不說要顧慮到地方人心，不叫人說「勝利來了秩序走開』，至少也要顧點國際體面，別叫那幾萬美軍和多少日僑歸國後把上海描寫成一個沒有秩序的城市吧？</p>
<p>可是，話說回來了，秩序該由誰來維持呢？</p>

<p>— 今純</p>
<p>「有一天淸早，就在美軍冲繩島登陸前一兩天，我們奉到命令，說琉球島外發現美運輸艦，令我們去襲擊。</p>
<p>「我們一行出發的共八個人。他們給了我一架舊的水上飛機，母小時最快的速度是一百二十海里。帶了一顆二百五十公斤重的炸彈，燃料僅够我飛到指定的地點。</p>
<p>「我們出發時也曾舉行一些儀式，但毫無甚麼特別的地方。司令官站在一只桌子旁邊，桌上舖着白布，他遞給每人一瓶酒，飲時祝我們成功。我輪到最後一個，但是該和司令官握手時，我慌了，祗把那瓶酒往懷裏一塞。</p>
<p>「我們起飛時天已昏暮，才飛到冲　一半的路上，飛機的推進機不動了。富晚月色很好，我想尋一個地方　　，但附近沒有陸地，我祗好將飛機墜落到海上。我們同行的一個水兵才爬出飛機，海浪已將飛機　去。我們　救生衣逃命。我們起先在一起，不久一個浪頭來，　水兵就被　去，他大槪是被鯉魚吞吃了，後來我才知道那兒鯉魚很多。</p>
<p>「找在水中　扎了的莫有十七小時，有兩三次人已有些昏迷。最後漂流到一個小島上，沙瀨　，　的面積太小，連地圖上都　　，全島居民祗六十人。他們看到　不曾被鯉魚呑　，　很驚寄。島上的居民聽到美軍施用雷　，以爲一點聲響都會被聽見，接着就有飛機來轟昨，所以大家說話時都不敢大聲說。大家怕雄雞報曉的聲音被雷達聽見，於是把雞都殺了，大家一直吃着雞肉。島上祗一頭母牛，因爲牛呌，將牛也給宰了。」</p>
<p>以上是一個日本自殺飛機師的供詞，飛機師名呌岡本，年僅二十三歲，長的很漂亮，受審的地方在東京，岡本說話時仍帶着一些迷惘的神情。</p>
<p>岡本留在沙瀨島上，直待戰事結束後才回去。家裏的人在他出發後不久，就接到軍隊中一張油印的通知單，上面祗有簡單的幾個字：「岡本君駕機猛撞敵體，機艦同歸於盡，已壯烈殉國。」，等他一旦回到家中，家人俱喜出望外。</p>
<p>關於日本自殺飛機隊（日本人稱之爲「神風』隊），以前曾有許多神奇的傳說：說這班特攻隊員待遇特別好，生前有女人的享受，死後有隆重的儀式，一切和普通的飛行員兩樣。但據岡本講，這些都是軍部的宣傳，目的無非是要安慰死者的家屬，恐嚇美國人仕，麻醉日本的靑年。實際上自殺飛機師一切都和普通的機師一樣，因此他們常常和長官發生衝突，他們以爲待遇應當兩樣，他們以爲應當專去撞擊大型的戰艦，犯不上同那些小船拚性命。而他們內心中也一直懷着恐懼，他們明知道這種自殺隊不過是一種亡命的嘗試，對大局是沒多大裨益的。</p>
<p>日本靑年之所以肯加入這種自殺隊，也有他們的苦衷。據岡本講，他加入自殺飛機隊後，他感到稍微减去一些苦悶，因爲這樣他可以屏去許多煩惱，至少是有一件事情在做了，他們都希望能派到一架飛機去參戰，但日本的飛機非常缺乏，祗有自殺飛機師可以派到一架飛機，所以結果較優秀的飛行員沒有作戰的機會，而一班沒有作戰經騐的靑年，必須是加入了自殺飛機隊後，才有機會去參戰。作戰的都是沒有戰鬥經騐的人，這也是日本空軍失敗的一個原因。</p>

<h3 id="c108">美兵的待遇 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 趙匡</p>
<p>世界上沒有第二個國家，對於軍人的待遇，比美國更爲優厚了。美國的人民儘管節衣縮食，可是他們的軍隊是不能簿待的。他們的服裝之完備，自不必說，單在飲食方面，他們每日所需的熱力單位蛋白質，脂肪質，維他命等，都有充分合理的分配。他們除了薪俸之外，還有安家費。書報可以任意携取，不收任何費用，他們循例可以用五分錢買一包巧格力糖，一毛錢便可以買一罐十二兩的罐頭牛奶。此外他們還可以每天看三塲電影。不用說，也是免費的。鞋襪等各有兩雙，外套襯衫等，都有全套的配給。各物壞了之後，隨時可以調換新的。最近筆者有一位菲籍的學生從軍，他說單單衣着等物，已裝滿了兩只箱子。</p>
<p>初進去之後，月俸是五十元，另安家費每日二十五元。以上自然是美金計算，以後如有孩子，另有補助費。服役滿三十年即可食『長糧』所以無怪乎，美國人，都樂於從軍了。</p>
<p>同時政府對於將要復員的軍人的職業，也特別關懷。最近他們嘗舉行一次復員後的職員調查。其中大部分對於雜貨店，無錢電，等行業，發生濃厚的興趣，有些想辦養鷄塲，有些想開導遊社和運輸公司有些則預備養羊。</p>
<p>無論他們預備轉入那一行，政府總是盡量供給他們那一行所需要的資料，使他們有所參考。如經濟不足的，則由政府先行代墊，美國對於軍人優遇，可說是無微不至的了。</p>

<h3 id="c109">杜魯門的親信 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 沈翊鵾</p>
<p>杜魯門總統的顧問，是廣大而有趣的一羣。自從四月裏杜魯門就任以來，華盛頓有很多人都想知道誰是杜氏最親信的顧問。</p>
<p>事實是，杜魯門並沒有「最親信的顧問』。他接受大量的忠告，分享許多的秘密。</p>
<p>總統聽得很多，聽完之後，也想得很多。他在白宮裏，差不多接見每一個人；而他所接見的人中，十個裏面有九個，是有一件事要控訴，要抱怨的。</p>
<p>他聽完了許多人的意見，然後構成自己的意見；我們知道，在上議院時，杜魯門有過多年的訓練。</p>
<p>總統日常最接近的人，是他的三個秘書，和兩個副官。</p>
<p>查爾斯洛斯是杜魯門的新聞秘書，對於總統的進展，他是永遠留意的。洛斯的工作，是使總統給全國的讀者和聽衆一個最好的印象。</p>
<p>馬休康諾萊是總統的委任秘書，一個眼光銳利，漂亮的新英格蘭人，長期担任過政府的調查員。他是美國總統與許參高呼急嚷的羣衆間的緩衝者，這些羣衆們喊着要把某一個特殊問題的特殊一面，告訴給總統聽。</p>
<p>第三位秘書是威廉哈賽特，羅斯福時代留下的唯一白宮老人。哈賽特處理多數總統的信件，由於他在這方面工作多年，省掉杜魯門總統不少的麻煩。</p>
<p>兩位副官是哈里沃漢副少將，和詹姆斯瓦達　海軍上校。在第一次大戰時，沃漢是杜魯門部下的砲手，一個極富有幽默感的人，他使總統的心境永遠保持快樂。瓦達曼　海軍預備役，密西西比州人，聖路易斯的銀行家。他對於總統的保護防衛不遺餘力。</p>
<p>不過，總統所接近的這些人，對於他的重大決定，並沒有甚麼關係。</p>
<p>國務卿貝爾納斯和的翰斯耐德也許是總統最密切的同僚。貝爾納斯是南卡羅里人，過去和杜魯門在上議院中同事，是出入白宮最忙的一個。</p>
<p>斯耐德是另一個總統最接近的政府上層人員，他是阿坎沙州人，一位成功的密蘇里銀行家。最近謠傳斯耐德要回到聖路易斯的銀行去，其實，總統決不肯輕易放他走。</p>
<p>多數的杜魯門行政分析家，忽略了他的兩位最有力的朋友——喬治埃倫和綦斯里畢佛。</p>
<p>埃倫在若干年前，是華盛頓一家旅館的夜班書記，後來曾任哥倫比亞區委員。現在是一位極成功的商人，美國若干最大公司的股東。如果，總統有所謂最親信的顧問，無疑的，埃倫是其中之一。</p>
<p>畢佛是上議院的秘書，總統常常和他共餐。</p>
<p>此外，總統還有許多接近的人，不過書不勝書。</p>
<p>我們最後不能不一提的，是郵政總長勞勃漢尼干，他是白宮紅人；漢尼干訪問總統，十有九次，包含重大政治事件。</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<h3 id="c110">廣播航空敎材 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 石溪</p>
<p>當此「原子』威脅時代，世人對各種新式武器，莫不悉心研究探討，對航空建設，更有極度的『航空感」。</p>
<p>美國已將航空敎材編入學校課程內，在查坦奴加與鄧納西等地學校，學生七歲時，便授以淺顯的航空知識。高班學生，不僅學習飛機構造各部門，並給以乘坐飛機的機會；在附近各城市飛行，藉廣眼界，增進認識世界「活」的知識，這在敎育方面，是値得重視的。</p>
<p>美國現在約有二萬八千所公立學校已設有航空課程。國營航空事業機關俱予以臂助，而軍政當局並贈以剩餘飛機，作爲學生實騐之用。</p>
<p>我們中國雖因人力物力所限，難與歐美並駕齊驅，然亦當在可能範圍內鼓勵航空事業，宣導有關航空建設知識，在學校方面，儘可普遍的授學生初步航空學術，如飛機原理，航空史料，飛機模型實騐等等，有關飛行事業的敎林，而社團方面，亦可舉行飛機展覽，或利用電影，宣傳航空新聞及航空建設知識，使我們「不機械化」的民族，從此亦能暫時放下筆桿，易以斧鎚和螺絲釘；力求國家工業化，一洗過去「夫子式」的陳舊思想。</p>
<p>戰後今日，正建國伊始之時，讓我們把握千載難逢的大好時機，廣播航空敎材，促進飛行事業的發展重建工業化的新中國。</p>

<h3 id="c111">公牛的末運 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 施果</p>
<p>作爲雄强剛健的象徵的公牛，現在已臨着沒落的命運。世界上公牛的數目將日見减少，原因是人工授胎法逐漸普遍，牛奶棚中也鬧起失業問題。</p>
<p>現代進步的人工授胎法，能使一頭公牛產生八十頭公牛的效能，丈夫過剩而淘汰，公牛在未長足前都送入屠宰塲當小牛肉出賣了。在美國奈勃拉斯加（Nebraska）公牛的數目至少要减少三千頭，然而用人工授胎所產的小牛，計有二萬頭，年年增加，一九五〇年時將達七萬頭。</p>
<p>人工授胎法有許多優點，一般說起來，在畜牧塲上公牛比較是危險的，而且飼養的費用也較昂，爲了傳種，他們實在是浪費的東西。現在人工授胎法只費五元錢的手續費就可以請到一個獸醫，而抽取一西西的公牛精液，就可以供人工授胎之用，這樣每一頭公牛每年至少可以使一千四百頭母牛受精成胎。</p>
<p>另外一個更重要的優點，就是選擇優良的種質，產生强壯的後代。一頭好種的牛要値二千美金。單獨的一家牧塲也許不能負擔，但組織一個聯合會以合作方式共同購用，就比較合算。佳種的乳牛能產多量的乳，因此劣種非歸淘汰不可，這是牛的優生。</p>
<p>由此不難想像人類的優生以及生殖統制在將來所取的途徑與意義。人體的人工授胎早已成功，有人曾說男性在兩性中是沒有用的東西，將來只需少數男性或者簡直不需要男性也可以傳種接代，繁殖後世。當然，人類優生決不會是這樣的，公牛有末運，人類並不如此，男人們現在不必大起恐慌。</p>

<p>納粹覇業已經完全毁滅了，但日耳曼民族過去的光榮史依舊存在。德國對於人類文化的貢獻仍使人重視，尤其是科學方面，德國一向居於唯我獨尊的領袖地位。這並不一定表示德國人的優秀，不過德國的科學確有其悠久的歷史與良好的傳統，這種優點當然不應該讓它與黷武主義同時毁減，爲着人類的前途利益，倒應該將它保存而發揚光大。</p>
<p>因此接收德國的科學在今日確是等於接收一處人類的大寳庫。據美國方面發表，已獲得了許多德國科學家做成或未做成的研究成績，都是煞費心血的可讚美可寳貴的傑作。</p>
<p>大多數的研究，都有軍事的秘密，現在可以發表的是有一種飛機師彈簧的座位，在高空中遇緊急時，可以隨意脫離機身，飛越空中，雖在二萬呎高空以及五百哩以上的速度時，亦無危險。這是一種聯合國方面尙未成功的新發明，對於空軍人員的生命安全，將有極大的好處。</p>
<p>蔡司光學研究所中的種種新銳而精良的儀器，美不勝收，聯合國甘拜下風。又有航空試騐所的巨型風筒，風速可以高至每小時五百三十哩，在美圃現在還祗能做到二百哩。</p>
<p>德國的科學家大多數都表示願意投誠，繼續爲聯合國做研究工作。在投降前，他們曾奉命銷毁文件及研究記錄，但多數均不忍照辦，所以現在還能保存。戰爭結束後，希望他們爲和平繼續努力，將功贖罪，爲時匪晚。</p>

<p>清除汚水垃圾與便溺</p>
<p>廣設公廁爲切要之圖</p>
<p>上海全市衛生問題，自日寇蹂躪以後，頓改前觀，因難民載道，乞丐滿途，以致嘔唾便溺，隨地皆是，沿路崗警，無法禁止，淸道夫役，不及掃除，　此情形，不獨於衛生有關，對市容觀瞻，亦大不宜！現當市政革新，建設伊始，一切衛生事宜，均　澈底整　，根本解決。</p>
<p>市區各處，最令人不堪入目者，　惟溝渠汚水，堆積垃圾，沿途便溺三種！今市政當局厲行淸潔衛生，舉行淸潔運動，調查各里弄及商店住戶，令各設置垃圾箱桶，隨時傾倒，　圾問題，從此可以解決；至於溝渠汚水，亦應從速淸除，在低窪之地，宜加高路面，使雨後不致積聚，或開通陰溝，使積水易於滲洩，在未塡之溝、宜速塡滿，以免腐臭，此事正由工務局積極辦理，當可一　永逸；惟沿途便溺，因乞丐旣多，行人又衆，隨時亂撒，防不勝防，且溲溺之事，人所難免，市區地方遼闊，街道整　，里弄之閒，絕少厠所，行人乞丐，迫於便急，不得不隨地溲溺，此亦人情之常，所謂鋌而走險，急何能擇！此種過失，不獨在溲溺之人，衛生當局，亦當負其責任。</p>
<p>茲就鄙見所及，擬請當局就全市各區，廣設厕所，藉以減除溲溺之弊！昔西人治理租界，以多設厠所爲觀瞻不雅，且有礙衛生，致市民多感不便，要知溲溺之事，旣稱大便小便，自以便利爲主！爲淸潔而少設則所，適因厠所少而增加汚　，厠所愈多者，道路愈淸潔，可見淸潔之法，不在少厠所，而在厠所多與管理得法也。</p>
<p>今議在市區，每隔里許設公厠一所，並須男女厕所相隔並設，以便行人；凡在各路交叉處之三角空地，均當建爲公厕，廢地利用，一舉兩得，自遍設公厠以後，如再遇有在路旁溲溺者，凡屬崗警或負有淸理地方之責者，均得扭送警局懲處，如此則市容自無不整潔之弊，此即淸潔全市之根本辦法，願當局亟起圖之。</p>

<p>二　　食烟毒成癮之原因</p>
<p>人體對於烟毒能成習慣之原因，（意即逐漸服用大量烟毒，而不發生急性中毒致死之原因，）至今據各國學者所研究，其說不一，故本文從略。茲僅述一般吸食烟毒成癮之原因，此即烟毒有靈騐之止痛鎭靜止瀉等作用，故患者常擅自用以治療各種發生疼痛或久治未癒之疾病，如胃痛，腹痛，腹瀉，咳嗽，氣喘，淋病，吐血，遺精等，但不知對於上述之病症，祗能治標，不能治本。所以偶而吸食，似甚見效，一經停服，病又復發。於是一再吸食，日久而成癖癮矣。適量烟毒，有一時的興奮提神作用，使人體力陡增，精神發生快感。故甚多操勞過度，體力衰竭者，誤爲有效神藥，更有冶遊賭博之輩，常用以爲興奮提神妙品，初以爲逢塲作戲，藉以增加興趣，消除煩惱，不知日久成癮，而後悔莫及矣！余曾作統計，以吸烟作爲興奮提神而取快感者爲最多，其次則爲用以治病成癮，更有極少數俗稱胎裏癮者，即在胎兒時，其　烟癖甚深，迨出生時即發生烟癮者。</p>
<p>三　烟毒發癮現象</p>
<p>吸烟者　所需之分量不足，或突然中止時，發生種種不舒適之現象，醫學上稱爲禁斷現象，俗曰發　。至其所發生之現象，則視吸者使用之烟毒種類。分量，體質，原因而不同，一般習見之禁斷現象，爲欠伸，噴嚏，流淚，寒顫，出汗，抽筋，疲倦，苦悶不安，失眠疼痛，失眠曖氣，嘔吐，腹瀉，遺精等，此種現象雖覺苦痛難堪，但對於體質强健，烟癮不深者，其發生不過四五日，當可减退，而漸趨全癒。惟最初因患某種頑症或重病而吸烟者，在突然中止時，往往發生吐血，下痢，氣喘，震顫，虛脫，漸致心臟機能障碍，而有生命之處，亦常有發見。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rumor of Chiang Ching-kuo Flying to Moscow; National Army Bravely Advances in Freezing Weather, Standing By to Enter Shenyang City <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 26th - Midnight broadcast states: Chiang Kai-shek's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, intending to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, this news has not been officially confirmed by Chongqing. Moreover, in the past 24 hours, Du Yuming's troops advanced 40 miles in temperatures of zero to twenty degrees [Fahrenheit], and are expected to receive Shenyang and Harbin around New Year's Day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 26th] After entering Dahushan, the National Army has stationed in Tangjiawopu, approximately twenty *li* northeast of Dahushan Railway Station.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] News revealed today: General Du Yuming's troops are using Jinzhou as their base and are currently advancing in a fan-shaped formation along four routes to fully control the southern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces. Troops advancing rapidly from Goubangzi have already occupied the major city of Weiding (transliteration) north of the Beining Railway. Another unit is advancing towards Yingkou. However, the National Army that has reached the outskirts of Shenyang is still awaiting Soviet permission to enter the city.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 26th] According to the most reliable sources: Before completing negotiations with the Soviets regarding the National Army's entry into Xinmin, Du Yuming's troops will remain in their current positions. Xinmin will be the last stop before the National Army enters Shenyang. Du Yuming's troops encountered minimal Communist resistance during their rapid advance. Some troops are marching on foot, while others are traveling by train.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Northeast Headquarters to Move to Tianjin or Jin County; Du Yuming Commands at the Front; Communist Forces in Rehe Province to Be Cleared Within Ten Days <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Local Chinese newspapers reported today: Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters will soon move to Tianjin or Jin County because General Du Yuming's military action to clear out the Communist forces within Rehe Province has already begun. His troops are currently attacking the Communist forces concentrated north of Qinghuazi. It is reported that General Du has left Beiping for the front lines to personally direct all operations, with the aim of clearing Rehe within ten days and joining forces with Soviet troops near Shenyang. It is reported that a large number of National Army troops are being transported by American ships to Huludao to enter the Nine Eastern Provinces. General Albert Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, will soon come here by plane for inspection. Furthermore, according to authoritative sources from the United Press: It was originally planned to move Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters to Changchun, but this plan has been temporarily abandoned due to the disruption of railway transportation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] A newspaper reports: Guo Ding, under General Du in the Northeast, will soon be transferred to the Fifth Army. Currently, there are only two armies in the Northeast: the 13th and 52nd Armies. The 94th Army, currently in Beiping, is scheduled to be transported by air to Changchun, while the Fifth Army, currently in Yunnan Province, has received orders to move to Haiphong, awaiting American ships to go to the Northeast. Since December 23rd, the Communist forces have not resisted the advancing National Army. The Communist forces retreat upon the arrival of the government troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] After completing the first stage of taking over defense duties after exiting the [Shanhaiguan] Pass, our army has now launched the second phase of work. After Director Du ordered the troops to depart on the 22nd, they advanced 90 *li* on the 23rd, reaching Beijin County and Ping'anbao, north of Goubangzi. A Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Director Du before he departed for the front lines, first visiting Director Du's military affairs office. Mr. Du said: The people of the Northeast have suffered unspeakable hardships under the brutal rule of the Japanese for fourteen years. Now, unexpectedly, after victory, they are once again ravaged by the Communist forces. The innocent people are suffering. Those who witness the reality are all in tears. According to the general account of the fathers of the Northeast: The calamities suffered in the past three months are even worse than the brutal rule of the Japanese for fourteen years. Therefore, in the Northeast, men, women, old and young, all hope that the National Army will arrive soon to save the people from fire and water. When the reporter continued to inquire about the situation of the people of the Northeast assisting the National Army, Mr. Du replied: Since the National Army exited the Pass, it has been deeply loved by the people. They are extremely enthusiastic in maintaining order, providing supplies, and so on, at any time and anywhere. Even many people are willing to contribute all their possessions to the National Army. The National Army does not commit the slightest offense, and has received great cooperation from the people. What is most deeply moving is that wherever the troops arrive, the local people automatically rush to repair the transportation lines destroyed by the Communist forces, so that the National Army can advance without obstruction. As a result of fourteen years of Japanese oppression in the Northeast, the people's patriotism has become even stronger. When the reporter mentioned the food and clothing situation of the National Army after exiting the Pass, Mr. Du said: There are currently no difficulties in supplying the troops after exiting the Pass. There is ample supply of coarse grains in the Northeast. After the entire Northeast is taken over, all supplies will be used locally.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Negotiations between Paris and Chongqing regarding Vietnam seem to have ended amicably after three months of discussion. It was learned today from official sources here that French troops will soon take over the Chinese military defense areas in Tokyo and northern Annam, and will also take over the British military defense areas in Cochinchina.

His family has been summoned to the Army Hospital to listen to his last words. Wang served twice as the Chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. He was 72 years old and was arrested by the Chinese authorities earlier this month.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Bureau has recently exchanged meteorological information with the U.S. Navy. In addition to Rear Admiral Thomson of the U.S. Naval Command sending Captain Moore to Taiwan to cooperate technically with the Bureau, the Meteorological Bureau is also using a 2-kilowatt transmitter for transmitting meteorological information to Shanghai, while the U.S. side is exchanging with the Bureau meteorological information from Sevastopol, inland China, and various Japanese locations in the South Seas.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 25th] The inaugural trial run of the Lanzhou-Ningxia Highway took place on the 25th, on a day when the snow had just cleared. Zhang Zhili, Director of the highway engineering office, invited representatives from the Gansu Provincial Government's Department of Construction, the Northwest Highway Bureau, and other agencies, as well as engineering personnel, a total of more than 30 people, who traveled in two passenger cars, passing over the Yellow River iron bridge and driving north. It is estimated that they will arrive in Ningyuan in three days. The Northwest Highway Bureau has already sent personnel to inspect the route, plan to set up stations, and regularly handle freight transport, reopening the Gansu-Ningxia passage that has been closed for nearly ten years.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The Municipal Government has been ordered to build a Martyrs' Shrine and has selected the Badashan area in the new western suburbs as the site of the shrine. The area was originally the location of the Japanese "Loyal Spirit Tower." Construction is expected to begin in January. In order to concentrate the words and deeds of the loyal martyrs, the Municipal Government has formed a Loyalty Investigation Committee to investigate the life experiences of the martyrs. Those deemed necessary for entry into the shrine after investigation will be submitted to the Central Government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e16">On the Eve of the Political Consultative Conference; All Parties Actively Prepare; Definite Date Not Yet Set; Special Envoy Marshall Busy Listening to Opinions <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Special Telegram] After Marshall arrived in Chongqing, the Communist Party representatives stated to the Special Envoy that the Communist Party is willing to unconditionally cease military actions. However, the Communist Party representatives in today's talks between the government and the Communist Party reportedly still have the condition that Communist Party personnel hold government positions as a prerequisite. As for the Political Consultative Conference, all parties are actively preparing. The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and the Communist Party all have secretariats engaged in work. It is rumored that the conference will be held in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 26th] Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, stated yesterday that the Communist Party will formally submit a written proposal for an unconditional ceasefire today when the Nationalists and Communists resume negotiations, which have been suspended for five weeks. "We urgently desire an immediate cessation of fighting, the importance of this step is above any event." The submission of this proposal has been approved by Mao Zedong. The on-and-off negotiations between the Nationalists and Communists have dragged on for more than a year. The last time the negotiations were suspended, it has now been five weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 25th] The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has decided to propose in writing an unconditional cessation of hostilities. China may have a chance of a truce by the New Year. Although some say that this matter is by no means as simple as it appears on the surface, it can be seen that the CCP has made concessions, so it is particularly noteworthy. The CCP previously requested that the Chinese army retreat to its original defenses at the time of the Japanese surrender, but now it seems that the Communist forces are prepared to "freeze" both sides in their current locations. If a ceasefire can indeed be declared as a result, the work of the Political Consultative Conference will be greatly facilitated. The conference is expected to convene in January.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] The Political Consultative Conference, originally scheduled to be held yesterday, is now [unclear], but political leaders are very busy during the Christmas holidays, conducting preliminary discussions. It is said that the consultation meeting may start as scheduled on January 1. U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, has now become the center of Chinese political activity. It is believed that the leaders of all political parties want to know Marshall's position before attending the consultation meeting. According to Chinese newspapers, Special Envoy Marshall spoke with the Communist Party delegation for one hour at his residence on the first day of this week and told the representatives that he was prepared to hold informal meetings with leaders of the Communist Party, Kuomintang, China Democratic League, China Youth Party, and non-partisan leaders in Chongqing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] General Marshall received four representatives from the Democratic League today to listen to their opinions on Chinese politics. Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department declared today: He does not know whether General Marshall will participate in the Political Consultative Conference, but the Chinese government will never hinder the efforts of the special envoy to promote the common interests of the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e17">New Trends Brewing in the Communist Army; Plot to Concentrate Forces in Hebei and Shandong; Military Commission Spokesperson Denies Rumors Reported by Xinhua <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Chongqing, 26th] Amidst calls from all sectors of the country for the government to resign and sue for peace, the recent movements of the Communist army are now brewing new trends. The troops besieging Guisui and Baotou are recently withdrawing to the Northeast. The troops that captured Chengde have also withdrawn. Their conspiracy seems to be to concentrate forces and take action in Hebei and Shandong, and to cut off the passage between Inner Mongolia and the Northeast. Regarding the center of gravity of the Communist Party's military and political affairs, it is gradually shifting from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou. It is generally believed that the prospects for the current unity talks and the Political Consultative Conference to be held next month cannot be viewed with excessive optimism.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 26th] A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated: The "Chongqing Xinhua Daily" published on February 13th the statement that "Chief of Staff He once met with Sakai in Beiping and agreed to turn the Japanese army in Tianjin and Beiping into an anti-communist army." This is purely a complete fabrication, attempting to confuse the public.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin, 25th] Communist troops near Tianjin have recently been buying up banknote paper at high prices and hiring printing workers from the Tianjin Yi Zhong Company to massively print counterfeit banknotes for use in Tianjin, disrupting the financial system.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinzhou, 25th] The Communist army arbitrarily issues banknotes in the north, forcing the people to use them, stipulating that the exchange rate with the puppet Manchukuo currency is five to one. The people cannot bear the suffering and are fleeing in droves.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Wuxi, 26th] The Nanjing-Shanghai Pacification Supervision Group, led by General Sun Yuanliang, departed on the 24th, first arriving at Biaozi Town, then proceeding to Jiangyin County. The people lined the streets to welcome them. In the afternoon, local figures were convened for a symposium, followed by group meetings to discuss issues such as politics, culture, economy, and security. In the afternoon, the masses held a large rally, chaired by County Magistrate Fang, with over two thousand people in attendance. Commander Sun delivered a speech and set up a confidential complaint box for the people to voice their grievances. The atmosphere was exceptionally enthusiastic. The group returned to Wuxi on the 25th.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th] At the first fellowship meeting held by the Nanjing cultural figures at the Cultural Movement Committee of Nanjing City, opinions were exchanged on the current situation, and a declaration on the current situation was passed. It has now been finalized and the full text is published, stating briefly: Peace and unity are necessary conditions for carrying out the great task of nation-building. Therefore, standing from the position of the people, we sincerely hope that the Political Consultative Conference can proceed smoothly and achieve satisfactory results. We are willing to provide four points of opinion on the current situation. First, we hope that all representatives, especially the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, can prioritize the nation and the people, not create problems, and not propose unacceptable conditions. Second, we hope that the Chinese Communist Party will resolutely return its troops to the state, listen to the government's reorganization and disbandment, and that political parties should compete with political views, not with force; compete in the political arena, not on the battlefield. Third, we do not wish to list the various deceptive propaganda and illegal crimes of the Chinese Communist Party. We urge the Chinese Communist Party to listen to the people's demands for peaceful residence, return to their hometowns, and oppose the cries of rebellion. Immediately lay down the butcher knife, pull back from the precipice, and submit the matter to the scrutiny of the world. Fourth, the ultimate goal of the Chinese National Revolution is to implement democratic constitutionalism. Now that the National Assembly is scheduled to convene, we can only move forward along this correct path. We hope that the Political Consultative Conference is a bridge to the National Assembly, not a substitute for the National Assembly. We hope that the government's composition will be strengthened as a result of this conference, but there should be no so-called "coalition government" plan, and we must cherish the national center that the people unanimously support.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 26th] The liaison conference of magazine publishers in the provisional capital recently issued a declaration on the current situation, stating briefly: Our country's eight-year long war of resistance against Japan has finally achieved the goal of final victory. During these eight years, the entire nation paid an unprecedented and unparalleled price. The leaders above pondered deeply and worked tirelessly, while the people below left their wives and mothers, economized on food and clothing. The soldiers on the front lines even fought against the enemy's artillery with their blood and flesh. The ultimate goal is today's victorious outcome, a unified situation, and a democratic and peaceful country. The government is about to convene the National Assembly and return power to the people. Anyone who dares to commit a great outrage and violate the will of the people is a public enemy of the people. We want peace, and the first thing we oppose is internal strife. We want democracy, and the first thing we oppose are those who undermine the law. We want unity, and the first thing we oppose is separatism. We want construction, and the first thing we oppose is destruction. The Communist Party has violated the will of the people, launched internal strife, and obstructed nation-building. Knowing that its strength is insufficient and that it cannot withstand the anger of the masses, it should repent and abandon its selfish desires, and use political means to resolve all problems. Communist Party members with discerning friends, listen to the cries of the people! We are people who promote public opinion and speak for the people. What our hearts perceive as dangerous, we must speak out. To pull back from the precipice and turn danger into safety is the only good opportunity at present. It is difficult to withstand the anger of the masses, and it is impossible to achieve one's selfish desires. This is an unchanging lesson from ancient times. We dare to offer our sincere words to the people and to the Communist Party.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Breaking a Three-Month-Long Stalemate; Moscow Conference Concludes; Final Communiqué and Protocol to Be Released Today <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th] Well-informed sources in London expect the final communiqué and protocol of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be released within 48 hours; there is even a possibility of release tonight (early Thursday morning Shanghai time). According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the speed of the three foreign ministers' talks was largely due to their willingness to spend Christmas working. If there are no other delays, British Foreign Secretary Bevin may return to the United Kingdom before the end of this week, with approximately two weeks to prepare for the United Nations General Assembly scheduled to convene on January 10th.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 26th] The British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers met on Christmas Day at 4:00 PM and did not adjourn until 9:30 PM, making it the longest meeting to date. Observers commenting on the interim report announced by the conference consider it to be a sign of success. The heads of the British and American governments have taken a cautious attitude towards the development of the conference, which is surprising and even warns that the foreign ministers' conference will not issue a communiqué at all, but the foreign ministers' conference has at least produced a significant result for the agreement on the Balkan Treaty. The three Deputy Foreign Ministers will soon resume work in London to discuss draft treaties for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. The London Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in October of this year was stranded because of this issue. Within the next four months or less, approximately before May 1, 1946, all countries that participated in the European War will hold the first peace conference of the Second World War.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 25th] According to authoritative sources today, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes has expressed considerable satisfaction with the achievements of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Concrete agreements have been reached on a number of unresolved issues. Washington is even more pleased with the achievements of the conference, which are far beyond what was expected. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union has not yet obtained atomic secrets, but it is reported that the three foreign ministers discussed the issue of global co-management of atomic energy at the meeting, based on the declarations of the United States, Britain, and Canada.</p>
<p>China Has Agreed to Convene a Peace Conference</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 26th] It is reported that China has agreed to the proposal of the three powers, namely, China will be listed as one of the five inviting countries, inviting twenty-one Allied countries to hold a United Nations Peace Conference after the draft treaties prepared by the three powers are completed.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th] The ambassadors of China and France have been notified of events at the Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that directly affect the interests of China and France. It is reported that the Chinese government has expressed its agreement with the matters recommended in the first communiqué. US sources say that France has not yet expressed its agreement, but has not expressed its opposition either. Furthermore, according to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British public deeply hopes that the Moscow Conference can reach a resolution on the control of atomic energy, so that the United Nations Organization General Assembly to be convened on January 10th can proceed smoothly. It is commonly believed here that the success or failure of the conference can be used as an "acid test" for this matter. However, the resolution on atomic energy is a matter of trust, so there must first be cooperation between countries in other areas. For this reason, the first task of the Moscow Conference is to rebuild the international cooperation that failed at the London Foreign Ministers Conference. It is believed here that the first communiqué announced in Moscow will have a positive impact on the discussion of atomic policy.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 25th] Byrnes, Bevin, and other members of the three countries' delegations were invited by Stalin to a Christmas Eve banquet at the Kremlin, and the hosts and guests were in a warm and friendly atmosphere.</p>

<p>No Signs of Agreement</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Well-informed sources believe today that a plan for the independence of Korea may be formed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. These people point out that U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes is rumored to have brought instructions to the Soviet Union, urging the immediate realization of Korean independence and opposing the Soviet side's trusteeship proposal. However, as of now, there are no signs that the three powers have reached any conclusion. The U.S. position is that, in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, Korea should be allowed to hold a popular vote to choose its own form of government. Observers point out that the Soviet side has suggested that the U.S. and Soviet occupied zones should be merged, and that one country should be responsible for trusteeship, so that the fertile farmland in the south and the industry in the north can be connected during a certain prescribed period before the popular vote is held. But at present, the 38th parallel divides Korea into two. The Soviet side believes that if such a boundary continues to exist, it is almost impossible to hold a national popular vote.</p>
<h3 id="e26">British Dominion Participation in the Peace Conference Issue <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Three Powers Once Had a Dispute</p>
<p>[Reuters New York, 26th] The Washington correspondent of the New York Times stated that a dispute once arose in Moscow regarding the participation of British Dominions in the Peace Conference. The Soviet Union resolutely insisted that Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand were not independent countries and should be represented at the Peace Conference by the United Kingdom. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes strongly opposed this, saying that Ireland is also a British Dominion, but has always maintained an independent posture and has never participated in the war. The Soviet Union then retorted that if British Dominions and India could participate, then every Soviet Republic should have the right to participate. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes immediately said that if the Soviet Union insisted on having six votes, then each of the 48 states in the United States should also have one vote. As a result, a compromise was reached, and it was decided that all countries that actively participated in the war with their troops would be allowed to participate in the Peace Conference. (Note: This news has not yet been officially confirmed by British and American authorities.)</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th] British officials confirmed yesterday that India will also be able to participate in the second stage of peace negotiations with Germany's satellite countries. According to a Moscow radio broadcast on Monday, the peace treaties drafted by the five major foreign ministers will be submitted to the actively belligerent countries for discussion. Since India is one of the United Nations, it should participate in the United Nations general membership meeting to discuss the peace treaties.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Outlook for the United Nations Organization General Assembly <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 26th] The first General Assembly of the United Nations will open in London on January 10th, at which time a heated debate will unfold on the issue of maintaining world peace. All fifty-one member states of the General Assembly will be present. Due to procedural matters, the General Assembly will be divided into two sessions. The first session will begin on January 10th and will last for three weeks to two months, during which each member will establish agencies to make the United Nations General Assembly an executive body. The second session is expected to begin in April, most likely in the United States, as that country has been elected as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization. The agenda for the London meeting does not include major issues such as the atomic bomb, but any country can freely raise similar urgent issues for discussion. The London meeting may be very slow, just like the San Francisco Conference, with representatives spending weeks and months in subcommittees, nitpicking over the wording of the charter. One of the main tasks of the first session will be to appoint six small countries as temporary members of the Security Council, while China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France will be permanent members. The real work of maintaining peace is done by the Security Council, not the General Assembly. The first meeting of the General Assembly has a lot of work, but nothing particularly outstanding, mostly to establish the various agencies of the General Assembly and elect officers.</p>

<p>[U.S. Information Service New York, 25th] The New York Times wrote today that American public opinion has recently shifted, moving closer to accepting the idea of ​​a world government, an idea that was unacceptable to most Americans not long ago. For example, the recent U.S. permission for international organizations to use U.S. military force to maintain peace would have been absolutely impossible twenty-six years ago, when the U.S. refused to join the League of Nations because it refused to use military force to assist international organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Possible Merger of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 25th] Sulzberger, a special correspondent for the New York Times, telegraphed from London that the signs of a possible merger of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the Pan-Slavic movement are becoming increasingly prominent. The result "will completely transform the Balkans, and Italy, Turkey, and Greece will feel particularly uneasy." Sulzberger said that such a merger had been attempted once before, unsuccessfully, and is now awaiting two developments: the liquidation of the Bulgarian royal family and the signing of a peace treaty between Bulgaria and the Allied countries. The correspondent said that the reputation of the Bulgarian royal family is declining, and the establishment of a republic in Yugoslavia now has a sufficient stance. He said, "Marshal Tito mentioned this kind of federation when he was a guerrilla leader." and said that this plan now clearly awaits a decision from Moscow.</p>

<p>[United Press Baghdad, 26th] It was revealed today that in the past few days, U.S. troops will arrive in Iraq in accordance with the decision to withdraw from Iran on January 1st, in order to go to the Mediterranean port. The Iraqi government has granted permission to pass through and has prepared accommodations for them so that they can stay.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Franco Regime <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Becomes a Target of International Attack</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th] The New York Times' editorial yesterday said that the date of change of the Spanish regime is gradually approaching, and Spain becoming a target of international attack is a phenomenon that cannot be sustained for long. The recent note from the French government to the British and American governments was a call to attack the Franco regime. Although the contents of the note should not be disclosed, it is believed that France must have asked Britain and the United States to clarify their attitude towards Spain, and perhaps even advocated severing diplomatic relations with Spain, so that the Spanish government-in-exile established in Mexico could be recognized, and temporarily set up in French territory before moving into Madrid. France only has one representative in Madrid, and there is no embassy. The Soviet Union has not established any relations with the Franco government at all. The United Kingdom can recall its ambassador to Spain at any time and temporarily order him not to go to Madrid. Spain under Franco's rule has absolutely no hope of participating in the United Nations organization, and its economic relations with the world have been reduced to a minimum. The Franco regime is also constantly criticized by political figures in other countries.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Soviet Union Deliberately Expands Its Influence; Crisis Lurks on the Turkish Border; Prompts Close Cooperation Between Britain and France in the Middle East <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th] The New York Times said that the three Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia are plotting to seize considerable land from Iran and Turkey. Although Iranian Azerbaijan still claims to be a part of Iran, if the Iranian government insists on not changing its form, it is feared that the government of Greater Tabriz will eventually merge with Baku. It is rumored that the two provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran in northern Iran are also launching separatist movements. The government of Georgia, Stalin's hometown, is also plotting to seize the two provinces of Kars and Ardahan in Turkey. According to the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, the area should belong to Armenia, but since Kemal Atatürk rose to power and drove back the Greek troops, the Treaty of Sèvres has never been ratified. Three years later, the Treaty of Lausanne assigned the two areas to Turkey. Armenia once declared that Kars and Ardahan were its territory, but now Georgia claims that this was seized from Georgia. What the Moscow newspapers want to obtain is the entire northeast corner of Turkey, including the two ports of Trabzon and Rize, and control over the copper mining area. This obvious geopolitical action (which was Hitler's favorite term) aims to completely detach the entire eastern part of Turkey east of the Diyarbakır to Giresun line from Turkey. Nominally handed over to the Kurdish, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Georgian peoples, it is actually controlled by the Soviet Union. The important highway from Trabzon through Erzurum to Iran allows Moscow's power to reach the border of Syria. Britain and the United States have not formally expressed their attitude towards the Soviet Union's request to acquire Kars and Ardahan. But it is expected that what Britain and the United States are satisfied with must be the maintenance of the status quo. If the Soviet Union believes that it is justified, it should formally ask the United Nations organization to decide. Technically speaking, before the treaty expires in April next year, the Soviet Union should continue to respect the borders of Turkey. The treaty recognizes the cession of Batumi to the Soviet Union and allows Turkey to retain Kars and Ardahan, but Trabzon and Lazistan are not mentioned. The land that Georgia is demanding includes a part of Turkish Armenia, whose residents are mostly Laz people. In short, the eastern border area of ​​Turkey is the area coveted by the Soviet Union. The development of the situation in the area will inevitably lead to close cooperation between Britain and France and the unity of the countries in the Middle East, otherwise there will be no way to resist the intrusion of Soviet power.</p>
<h3 id="e33">The United States Values the Greek Election and Sends a Delegation to Observe <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] The United States is sending over six hundred representatives to various locations in Greece to observe the elections. The sheer number of representatives and the extensive scope of the plan can be considered unprecedented in history. In addition, the United Kingdom and France have also accepted Greece's invitation to send observers, but the Soviet Union has uniquely refused. The head of the U.S. delegation is former Under Secretary of State, Mr. Grady, who will cooperate with the State Department.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] Greece will hold significant elections before the end of March. These elections will be a test of the curative power of democracy, and the American delegation may as well call themselves the prescribing physicians. It is imperative that these become the most democratic and reliable elections in Southeastern Europe. Only in this way can Greece have a stable government to confront all its difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e35">One of Japan's Elder Statesmen, Count Makino, Leader of Liberalism <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 26th] Count Makino, former Minister of the Imperial Household, now 74 years old, lives quietly in a secluded villa near Tokyo, rarely leaving his home. According to well-informed sources in Japan, Makino was once forced to step down by the military clique, but now he has regained real power, resembling Japan's "Saionji" after the defeat. Emperor Hirohito once considered abdication after the Japanese military's complete surrender, but it was Makino who dissuaded him. Subsequently, the discussions of Hirohito's abdication vanished due to Makino's opposition. Foreign reporters wanting to interview him are told that Makino is old and doesn't concern himself with current affairs, and have personnel relay their opinions on the Japanese government to him. ... Ten years ago, he was considered a "dangerous liberal," but today he is once again trusted by Hirohito. The reason is none other than that three-time Prime Minister Konoe had already committed suicide by taking poison, and many of the Emperor's trusted confidants during the war were placed in prison by MacArthur's orders. Makino is the only surviving elder statesman. The changes of the world and the ups and downs of officialdom are not surprising. The new forces of the Makino faction include the current Prime Minister Shidehara (age 73), retired Admiral and current Privy Council President Suzuki (age 78), current Foreign Minister Yoshida (age 67), and former Minister of Home Affairs Matsudaira (age 68). These figures are those whom the Japanese military regarded as liberals, but if their liberalism is nothing more than outdated antiques, then it is still incompatible with the great changes Japan is facing today. Makino served as Minister of the Imperial Household for ten years beginning in 1925, and before that, he was Minister of the Interior for four years, so Hirohito.... Konoe's memoirs state that Emperor Hirohito's failure to actively intervene before the outbreak of the Pacific War was due to Makino's advice. Makino had secretly told Hirohito not to offer too many suggestions on political and diplomatic matters. Konoe also said that Makino advocated that the Japanese Constitution should be modeled after the British system. On December 26, 1935, Makino, unable to withstand the power of the military clique, announced his resignation. His successor, Saito, was killed in the "February 26 Incident" the following year. Marquis Kido told United Press reporters: "Makino had opposed the dangerous nature of the General Staff Headquarters," but ultimately there was nothing he could do. This summer, when Japan's situation was already hopeless, Suzuki was appointed Prime Minister, and he promptly accepted the Potsdam Declaration and announced the surrender. Yoshida is Makino's son-in-law. When Prince Higashikuni formed the cabinet, he appointed Yoshida as Foreign Minister. Shigemitsu, who had relied on Konoe for support, fell into obscurity. When Shidehara came out and reorganized the cabinet, Yoshida remained in his position, so Makino's influence can be imagined. Matsudaira is the father-in-law of Hirohito's older brother, Prince Chichibu. He served as Minister of the Imperial Household from 1936 to 1945 and had also served as ambassador to the United Kingdom, attending international conferences on several occasions and earning a reputation as an outstanding Japanese diplomat at the time. On March 10 of this year, he resigned due to the bombing and burning of the Imperial Palace. The relationships and past connections of all these people are very important in Japan and are factors that make up a new force around the Emperor. In addition, there is another key figure, retired Admiral Keisuke Okada. Okada is now 78 years old. He once served as Prime Minister and was also the target of the "February 26 Incident." After escaping by using a ruse, he remained in seclusion. At the time of the defeat, he was once again personally appointed by the Emperor, with Yoshida as a "messenger." This new force exchanged views with Makino several times and decided to recommend Shidehara as Prime Minister. According to unconfirmed reports: this new force has decided to make Matsudaira the future Prime Minister. Shidehara has stated that if the results of the next election show that the current cabinet is not representative of public opinion, he will voluntarily step aside and allow a multi-party cabinet to be formed. However, the current Shidehara cabinet will only be a transitional one, its mission being to promote "conservative liberalism" to preserve the imperial throne.</p>
<h3 id="e36">The French Government Announces the Devaluation of the Franc to Encourage Exports and Aid Economic Recovery <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The government officially announced yesterday that the new exchange rate for the French franc is set at 480 francs to one pound sterling, and 119.1 francs to one U.S. dollar. The original exchange rate was 200 francs to one pound sterling. The franc has been devalued six times since the last World War. The new exchange rate means that the gold value of the franc is only one-tenth of the franc of 1928. Yesterday, several French morning newspapers stated that the government intends to requisition foreign capital, specifically foreign currency, dividends from foreign stocks, foreign stocks held abroad, and foreign stocks held by French people within the country. The government will first requisition the first three categories, and the method for the fourth category has not yet been decided. Furthermore, according to this agency's financial correspondent, it was very appropriate to announce the devaluation of the franc while markets in various cities around the world were closed for Christmas. Prices and wages in France have increased, so the old exchange rate of 200 to one was no longer practical. It made French exports too expensive, resulting in imports far exceeding exports. As a result, France has incurred a substantial debt to the Bank of England. The new exchange rate of 480 to one was expected in London, and unofficial sources even said that the British government had expressed its agreement before the end of last week. Some reports from Paris said that due to pressure from the Communist Party, the French government initially intended to devalue the franc to 350 to one, but due to changes in the situation, it decided to devalue it to 480 to one in one fell swoop. The British side considers this a wise move. As for whether this devaluation of the franc will affect the franc's credibility, it depends on the reaction of the French people. If the French people believe that this is a reasonable countermeasure after the increase in prices and wages, then the devalued franc can remain stable. If the French people raise prices again as a result, and then wages have to be increased, it will inevitably lead to further inflation.</p>

<h3 id="e38">United Nations Far Eastern Commission Members Depart from the United States for Japan Yesterday, Expected to Return to Washington in Mid-February <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The entire members of the United Nations Far Eastern Commission are scheduled to depart for Japan this evening and are expected to return to Washington around February 15. The commission consists of representatives from ten countries. After discussing for two months, they have clearly stated that there are no major errors in MacArthur's measures in Japan. Most members have said that MacArthur's actions are trustworthy. The commission's task is to study how the directives issued by the United States to MacArthur are being implemented. So far, most of its time has been spent debating the directives themselves. The Basic Policy Committee, chaired by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, has rewritten the original directives issued by the White House to MacArthur after Japan's surrender and distributed them to the ten governments for consideration. If approved, they can be sent to MacArthur. According to U.S. officials, the rewriting of the directives only makes the tone clearer and more forceful, so the U.S. government does not object. Some members of the commission now believe that the time is near for the commission to take over the actual power of formulating policies towards Japan. Once the strict military occupation period is over, the commission will move to Japan and issue orders directly to MacArthur. Therefore, in recent communiqués, the word "advisory" has been removed from the commission's name. Some also believe that if the Soviet Union does not join, the commission can become a powerful body for formulating policies. However, if U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reach some kind of agreement on the establishment of a four-power control commission for Japan, as advocated by the Soviet Union, the commission can only retain its guiding position.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] Although the Allied Headquarters recently stated that the Japanese people do have enough food, Japanese newspapers continue to publish various figures and articles describing the current situation throughout Japan to show that the Japanese people have not obtained enough food. Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Mitsuzo Matsumura, after recently inspecting agricultural areas, told the Japanese press yesterday that the situation is so serious that the Japanese government may be forced to take force against farmers who possess rice and other food but refuse to hand it over to the government. He stated that the establishment of a high-priced food market to attract farmers is something that the government cannot control. It is said that the Japanese government is considering a new price policy.</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] According to the International News Service: the American Geographical Society announced on the 25th that wartime bombing and military excavations have contributed greatly to the study of ancient conditions. For example, when constructing fortifications in Gibraltar, a cave was tunneled through. This cave was clearly inhabited during Roman times. As a result of the German bombing of Canterbury, England, a city dating back to the Roman conquest in 43 AD was exposed. Bomb craters east of London have revealed several Roman porcelain utensils in their original form. The excavation of airfields in England has uncovered an ancient Celtic wooden temple dating back to about 500 BC. Although the war has halted many scientific excavation projects, this exploration has not been interrupted in other parts of the world. Soviet scientists reported the discovery of tribal footprints dating from 25,000 to 100,000 years ago. They discovered a giant fossil skeleton in northern Himachal, with a skull circumference of 33 inches and a tibia length of 33 inches. The University of Chicago reported the discovery of a city 250 miles from Baghdad, divided into sixteen layers of architecture, built layer by layer. A temple built by the cavalry of Ptolemy III was also discovered on the Egyptian plateau. British explorers have located the north magnetic pole in the center of the Smaragdine Islands, which is 530 miles closer to the geographical North Pole than previously thought. It is only 770 miles from the North Pole on the Earth's axis.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Secret Nature of American "Bat" Missile Publicly Revealed - Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Department <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Navy's aircraft-launched radar-guided missile, which was used to hit targets miles away, destroyed many Japanese warships and merchant ships in the final year of the war, the U.S. Navy recently revealed.</p>
<p>This was the first successfully controlled automatic bombing device operated by any country during the war. This closely guarded wartime secret weapon takes its name from the "Bat." Truly, when a bat flies, it emits a rapid series of sound waves, and it relies on the echo of these sound waves to guide itself. The missile's direct approach to the bombing target is also based on the echo of radar to automatically adjust its direction, so it is called the "Bat."</p>
<p>More Powerful than Japanese "Human Torpedoes"</p>
<p>The "Bat" missile's guidance system is far more harmful than its counterpart, the human pilots in Japan's Kamikaze special attack teams. It can see its target under any visibility conditions, and its reaction is also faster. It takes up less space than Japan's human torpedoes, and never "fails." This radar guidance technology is cleverly integrated into the bomb during factory production.</p>
<p>The "Bat" missile is launched by Navy patrol bombers from far outside the defensive anti-aircraft fire net of the target. Once it leaves the mother plane, it becomes completely automatic. Any evasive action by the target ship cannot escape its control. Its high speed and small size simply made Japanese gunners unaware. Each Navy patrol plane carries one "Bat" under each wing.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Pralaess's First "Wing" team used "Bat" to bomb Japanese naval and ground targets on the Pacific front to great effect.</p>
<p>Examples of Missile Use</p>
<p>For example: Two aircraft simultaneously discovered an enemy ship 20 miles away using radar. They flew closer and identified it as a Japanese destroyer. The ship's anti-aircraft fire was very intense. When the two aircraft flew out of range, the Japanese immediately stopped firing. At that time, one of the aircraft immediately released its "Bat" missile. It quickly descended through the sky and headed straight for the destroyer, instantly destroying its bow. Another destroyer immediately approached to rescue the crew and fired wildly at the mother plane that launched the missile, but the mother plane had already flown out of range.</p>
<p>Using the "Bat" is a fairly simple procedure. The pilot of the mother plane simply finds its target, aims at the ship it wants to attack, and then presses the button to release the missile, and it's done. The released missile will automatically head straight for its target, even if its target is a convoy of fireships. The launching aircraft can still move freely according to the pilot's wishes.</p>
<p>Unaffected by Climate</p>
<p>The missile can be launched in any weather, day or night, but the target must be clearly identified, because its guidance system cannot distinguish between friend and foe.</p>
<p>This radar-guided missile is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of 10 feet, and is filled with explosives. Its speed is similar to that of an aircraft. Its range is so great that the mother plane can operate freely outside the enemy's maximum anti-aircraft fire net.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned bombing methods often become less accurate as the target distance increases, so the percentage of hits from outside the range of anti-aircraft fire is very small. However, the "Bat's" high accuracy is not affected by distance.</p>
<p>The fact proves that the Japanese never understood the nature of the missile, because it was always accurately targeting the target when the Japanese thought it was out of range. There was no warning from the mother plane beforehand, or if there was, it was very subtle. After the use of this secret weapon was revealed, U.S. Navy Chief of Ordnance Rear Admiral Halsey declared: "Although the principles of its use can be applied to other weapons in the future, it is now considered obsolete and unnecessary."</p>
<p>The Successful Manufacture of the Missile</p>
<p>In 1942, before Japan organized the Kamikaze Special Attack Team or adopted human torpedoes, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance asked the Scientific Research Society to explore a missile manufacturing program that could find its own target and be automatically controlled by radar. The originator of this plan was Navy Lieutenant Dirk.</p>
<p>The successful manufacture of this complex weapon was the result of close cooperation between many experts. Dr. De La Edeng of the National Bureau of Standards assisted in the technical work. Navy Lieutenant Dirk and Lieutenant Colonel Taibo integrated the military aspects of the work. The radar guidance system was the result of cooperation between experts from the following units: Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cambridge Institute of Technology under the direction of Drs. Staite and Lam, scientists at the Green Zao Electrotechnical Laboratory under the direction of Yuan, Dr. Aite and Dr. Cla of the Quantitative Bureau engaged in research on gas dynamics and stability. Navy Major McClaughlin of the Bureau of Aeronautics supervised the flight tests.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1941, one afternoon, the U.S. military was conducting a field exercise. An artillery company commander found an ideal field artillery position under a large tree. However, in order to set up the artillery position, two branches of the tree in front of the artillery had to be sawed off, and the military headquarters had a ban on damaging civilian property without the owner's permission. As a result, the artillery company commander had no choice but to first obtain the owner's consent, which delayed the time for setting up the artillery position by several hours.</p>
<p>Soon after, a journalist who witnessed this exercise was granted an interview with General Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. During the interview, the journalist mentioned this incident and asked him: "Why don't the troops temporarily ignore all necessary losses and carry on quickly, and compensate the owner for the losses afterwards? If the troops have to consider the farmer's trees, how can the U.S. military fight?"</p>
<p>Marshall looked at the journalist with a kind and friendly gaze, and said, "That kind of thing would be of great help to rapid military action." and said, "There is no doubt that the military would do that entirely." But he also said, "The United States is a democracy, and therefore the people have certain legal rights. In any case, the U.S. military should support these rights and avoid harming the interests of the people." Marshall felt that the brief delay in the exercise was a small price to pay for upholding the great principles of the founding of the United States.</p>
<p>Those who know General Marshall well know that the secret of his success does not lie in military talent. Although he is rich in military talent, his success lies in his genuine sense of democracy.</p>
<h3 id="e52">In the History of International Friendship and Cooperation - A British Exemplary Reporter - Laid the Foundation for the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Movement - Translated from the North China Daily News, this month's 23rd <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Under the Qilian Mountains, covered in snow in Gansu Province, there is a small city called "Santan" (transliteration). Just outside the south gate of Santan, at the foot of the mountain, lies a pile of brick-built green tombs, inside which lies a British man named Olwyn Hogge. He will never be forgotten by the Chinese people. He is the protagonist of this article.</p>
<p>China has many foreign friends, but none who can penetrate into the lives of the people like him. He can speak Chinese, he suffers and works with the Chinese people, and he is treated like one of their own.</p>
<p>Mr. Hogg's Arrival in China</p>
<p>He came to China in 1937, not long after the Sino-Japanese Incident. At that time, he was a special correspondent for the British Information Office. In October 1938, Hankou fell, and he stayed in the occupied area, later going to Peiping to observe the so-called "East Asian New Order." After that, he left Peiping with a group of students and lingered in the southwestern guerrilla areas for a year. From then on, he had a deeper understanding of the Chinese people. He could speak Chinese, sing patriotic songs, and sing choruses like the locals.</p>
<p>He heard that the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives were running successfully, so he began to travel again, wanting to find some work to do. It took him eight months and more than 600 kilometers of travel to finally reach Baoji. He lived in a thatched cottage in Shaanxi for a long time and then contracted typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Going to Baoji County to Start Industrial Cooperation</p>
<p>Baoji is the headquarters of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives in the Northwest. The cooperative movement in many provinces of China has flourished from there. There, he saw the work of the society, industry, hospitals, and schools.</p>
<p>The principles of "military first," "victory first," and "economic construction must be adapted to the needs of the country" have all been put into practice. Refugees are living under new living methods, and they are all supporting themselves by working, because they also have a share in supplying the needs of the army and the people, so they are also doing their part in the war of resistance. Hogg became extraordinarily enthusiastic there.</p>
<p>He did not go to Chongqing to look for work, and under the introduction of Professor Lapu Wute, he became the first British secretary of the branch. He worked very hard, often traveling to the cooperative centers, writing reports, and describing the success of the workers in overcoming difficulties. During this brave tenure with the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, he provided first-class news and propaganda materials to overseas news agencies.</p>
<p>Founding a Technical College to Train Technical Personnel</p>
<p>He gradually became interested in the work of the Bailey Technical College. Children in the technical college are being trained as technical personnel for various industrial cooperatives. In 1942, he taught at the Shuangshipo Bailey Technical College. As a graduate of Oxford University, he was more than qualified and experienced in teaching.</p>
<p>At Bailey Technical College, students and faculty consciously worked together towards a new revolutionary educational goal. The children of laborers or farmers receive specialized education there, all based on the practical work of emphasizing both academic studies and technology.</p>
<p>Faculty and students live together, and they do what the students do. In this way, team spirit and loyalty are cultivated successfully. In order to implement autonomous discipline, students have group organizations, and in order to encourage "competition," there are awards for simple basic virtues such as cleanliness, punctuality, and obedience. Hogg loved this kind of life very much. He worked tirelessly for the welfare of the children. He began to understand their background and their various problems, so the children regarded him as a good friend. He eventually became their principal.</p>
<p>Crossing Qingling Mountain and Running 100 Kilometers</p>
<p>In 1942, when he first became the head of the school, he encountered many setbacks. It was not easy to recruit suitable faculty. It takes considerable time to make the older children develop a genuine sense of responsibility. But he never gave up, and he worked even harder than before. Finally achieved the purpose of prestige. In the summer, in order to participate in the cooperative day held in "Dacheng," he led the entire school across Qingling Mountain, walking a distance of one hundred kilometers. This move increased the knowledge of many children in the countryside, because there were many children who were taking the train for the first time.</p>
<p>When this group returned to the foot of Shuangshipo Mountain and saw the school gate from a distance, the constant cheers made Hogg discover the dawn of his success for the first time. This proves the students' pride and love for their alma mater. Under his leadership, the school became more and more developed day by day. He organized labor teams, built roads, built bridges, and completed a Dalle Square. New houses were also built, and tens of thousands of bricks and tiles were all transported by the students, and these tasks were all completed in their spare time.</p>
<p>Forced to Move the School, Died of Tetanus</p>
<p>When the Japanese army advanced towards Shaanxi, the school decided to retreat to Santan. Hogg expressed doubts about whether this relocation was appropriate, but he still dealt with the situation at the time with his usual determination and hope. When he arrived in Santan, he established a new campus in a record-breaking short time. He was also planning summer work and sports programs. After that, he thought of running to Lanzhou to bring back several important personnel, but unfortunately this plan was not successful. During the relocation of the school, he accidentally injured his foot, which turned into tetanus. People were looking everywhere for serum that could treat tetanus in the radio and in telegrams, but it was too late. Hogg finally passed away on July 22, 1945.</p>
<p>Sixteen students supported his coffin, which was covered with a large school flag made by the students themselves, on which were written the names of all the students, in order to commemorate "their beloved teacher." After the funeral, a child asked, "Which direction is England in"? After inquiring clearly, he decided to pay his respects to his teacher's parents.</p>
<p>A Concluding Statement, Leaving a Lasting Reputation</p>
<p>We express our deepest regret for this British man who lived with the Chinese people. His death was a major loss to the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. On a small piece of paper, he wrote his last few words: "Everything I have is given to the Bailey School." He did not see victory and liberation in his lifetime, but the work he did in the dark days of the Chinese people will live forever in the post-war construction era. We will always remember Hogg, he is a perfect example of international friendship and cooperation. (Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department)</p>
<p>Enthusiastically Welcoming Allied Friends</p>
<p>(Left picture) When the First Division of the U.S. Marine Corps entered the Tanggu coast, the local people enthusiastically welcomed them and held a "Gaoxiao" performance to welcome the allies. This kind of "Gaoxiao" performance, which is similar to dancing, is usually only held during the New Year. The one wearing a steel helmet in the left corner is an American soldier. The Sino-American flags complement each other, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of Sino-American cooperation.</p>
<p>The Capital Celebrates Christmas Eve</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Military in the China Theater, spent Christmas Eve in Beijing with Commander-in-Chief Ying Qin on the 24th. The host of the banquet was Mr. He. In addition to Mr. Wedemeyer, Colonel Starr and other senior officials were invited to participate. More than 30 people from our side were invited, including Commander-in-Chief Chen Shaokuan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Marshal Ma in the Capital: An Unprecedented Scene of Receiving a State Guest <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— From a Common Man in Chongqing</p>
<p>For the past eight years, under the same battle line of anti-aggression and anti-imperialism, the traditional foundation of Sino-American friendship has been further expanded and consolidated. It is no wonder that when US Special Envoy Marshal George Marshall flew to the capital, those who rushed to the Baili Airfield, far from the mountain city, to welcome him included not only government military and political representatives, but also representatives from all walks of life, as well as Marshal Ma's colleagues. The total number of welcomers on the scene was no less than a thousand. The solemnity of the ceremony and the outpouring of warm feelings truly represent an unprecedented scene of welcoming a state guest.</p>
<p>Silver Giant Machine Breaks Through Floating Air</p>
<p>At 12:15 PM, a silver giant machine broke through the floating clouds and flew towards the city airspace. This was an opportunity to present our war-resistant holy city's heroic appearance to the state guest as he arrived in the air. China, in such a mountainous and inaccessible environment, is able to resist violence without yielding, which is the result of the wise decisions of our great leader.</p>
<p>After the plane circled the city three times, it turned and flew towards the airfield, instantly making the quiet air tense and serious. Under their skilled techniques, the American military police used ropes to create a perimeter. Secretary-General Wang Chonghui, wearing thick, near-sighted glasses, dressed in a blue mandarin jacket, was mistaken for a rustic old man by the American military police, who prepared to take him away. Fortunately, someone nearby noticed and explained, and he was finally allowed to enter the rope circle.</p>
<p>The Sound of Cameras Like Machine Gun Practice</p>
<p>At 12:25 PM, the giant C45 aircraft landed safely. Special Envoy Marshall emerged from the belly of the machine. Chinese and foreign reporters were given priority and rushed to take photos. The sound of cameras went off constantly, like machine gun practice. Major General Landahl, nimble in stature, was the first to step forward to pay his respects. Premier Song Ziwen then stepped forward to shake hands and exchange greetings. The band began to play the national anthems of the United States and China. Marshal Ma stood at attention to show his respect and was then introduced to the welcoming personnel by Premier Song. Marshal Ma shook hands with each of them to express his thanks.</p>
<p>The Crowd at the Airfield Moves with Marshal Ma</p>
<p>Marshal Ma is quite tall, with a ruddy complexion, a solemn demeanor, and full of energy. He did not appear to have been traveling. He wore purple leather shoes, held tan gloves, and wore a beige overcoat with five silver stars on his shoulders. At first glance, one can tell that he is a great military man—the Chief of Staff who planned and made decisions during the war and achieved great feats.</p>
<p>When he reviewed the guard of honor, he smiled and walked up to the captain, shook his hand, and expressed his satisfaction. Then, the human wave at the airfield also moved with Marshal Ma's steps. Marshal Ma remained silent throughout, unwilling to make any statements. This fully demonstrated the silent personality of this state guest who carries a heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>Large Sedan With a Five-Star Marshal's Flag</p>
<p>Finally, he stood in the same spot with Major General Landahl, gazing at the scenery of the airfield. This moment of gazing may have unfolded a picture of the current situation and future of great China in his heart. Our country must be unified and strengthened from a state of division. Premier Song, the chief of the state guest's reception, greeted Marshal Ma and boarded the large sedan with a five-star marshal's flag, and drove towards the city.</p>
<p>The welcoming personnel watched this state guest leave the airfield, and everyone discussed the state guest's mission. Some said: Marshal Ma is the only marshal below Pershing in the United States, so his mission to China will surely have a satisfactory outcome for China's future. Some said: Today, the Communist Party also had representatives at the scene to welcome him, which is a gratifying phenomenon. Some also said with emotion: If a family has a rebellious son who ruins the family reputation, it is a shameful thing to have neighbors persuade him. On my way home, I was immersed in their various discussions.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Our Country Elected Cardinal <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Rome dispatch stated that the Pope newly appointed 30 cardinals, including Chinese Bishop Tian Gengxin, who was also newly elected. This is an unprecedented event in the history of the Catholic Church. The news arrived just as the whole country was celebrating Christmas, and people in general, whether Catholic believers or not, felt gratified. A cardinal, known in the West as Cardinal, is popularly known in our country as a "red-robed archbishop." Apart from the Pope, it is the highest honorary position in the Catholic Church. The organization of the Catholic Church takes Rome as the old place of the Apostle Peter's hermitage. Therefore, Rome is the Pope and Bishop of Rome. Dioceses are established in various places, each with a bishop in charge of diocesan affairs. Several dioceses are gathered to form a religious provincial area, with an archbishop as the chairman of each provincial area. In places where church affairs are not yet developed, apostolic prefectures or apostolic vicariates are established, and apostolic prefects or vicars are sent to manage missionary affairs. Those who have been awarded the title of bishop are also called bishops. Those who manage Catholic affairs in various places are these bishops. Below the bishop are countless Catholic priests and believers; above the bishop is the Vatican in Rome, the Pope in Rome (commonly known as the Pope).</p>
<p>The Pope is the spiritual leader of 400 million Catholic believers worldwide. In order to handle church affairs worldwide, he needs the assistance of experienced and virtuous people for his consultation, so the College of Cardinals is established, with 70 cardinals. The reason why they are called cardinals is mainly because they participate in the secrets of the Catholic Church's center. The status of these cardinals, next to the Pope, is the most solemn. When the Pope is vacant, the supreme power to elect the Pope is in the hands of the 70 cardinals in the College of Cardinals. Outside the College of Cardinals and below the Pope, there are 11 departments to handle church affairs worldwide. Among them, the heads of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Bishops, and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches are concurrently held by the Pope, while the heads of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments are held by cardinals. From all this, it can be seen that the position of cardinal is very solemn. If compared with our country's government organization, its position is somewhat like that of a member of the National Government. Now that the Pope has appointed Bishop Tian Gengxin as a cardinal, he is truly the first person from our country to participate in the secrets of the Catholic Church's center. After hearing this news, we cannot help but have a few thoughts:</p>
<p>First, the Pope's appointment of Bishop Tian Gengxin as a cardinal shows how concerned the Pope is about church affairs in China. Catholicism came to China during the late Ming Dynasty and has been spreading in China for more than 300 years. Unfortunately, due to the Qing Dynasty's ban on religion, when the powers signed unequal treaties with us, freedom of religion was also included as a clause. Since then, Catholicism's missionary work in China has been based on unequal treaties, and many Chinese people have regarded it as a "foreign religion." Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, freedom of religion no longer needs to rely on treaties for protection, and freedom of belief has been clearly stipulated in national law. The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, was a Christian believer, and the current government, from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek onwards, also has many devout Christians who are extremely concerned about maintaining the missionary work of Christianity. It is said that in recent years, Catholic church affairs have gradually developed, with more than 130 dioceses, including more than 30 Chinese bishops and 4.5 million believers, which cannot be said to have a wide impact. However, compared with China's population, the number is actually still limited. Now that the Pope is extremely concerned about church affairs in China, and our government is also extremely supportive of Christian missionary work, we sincerely hope that Catholicism can continue to develop in our country so that China can gradually become a country with an increasing number of Christian believers, living up to the Pope's and our Chairman's expectations.</p>
<p>Second, Catholicism has more than 400 million believers worldwide, and there are certainly good and bad people among them. But these 400 million people are certainly not all ignorant and ignorant. Among them are many outstanding scientists, writers, and even politicians. Its ability to gain the belief of so many people certainly has profound meaning. Chinese customs, especially scholars and officials, have never attached importance to religion. Some people even regard religion as poison, and therefore often ignore Christianity—especially the mainstay of Christianity, Catholicism. But we cannot ignore one fact: that the world today can almost be said to be the Christian world, Western civilization is Christian civilization, and we really need to pay more attention to studying Christianity. China is still not a Christian country, and the percentage of Christian believers in the population of Shanghai is not high. However, Shanghai is celebrating its first happy Christmas after victory, and people of all ages, both men and women, have a passionate feeling. We hope that everyone will use the same mood to study the truth of Christianity enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Third, Christian believers cannot abandon their responsibility to China. Although the percentage of Christian believers in China's total population is not high, they have a great responsibility for China's nation-building. They should understand what obstacles are standing in the way of nation-building, and how they should exert and use their power to clear or reduce these obstacles. On the positive side, they should consider how to make the religion they worship acceptable and integrated by the Chinese people, just like Xu Guangqi, the respected elder of Shanghai in the late Ming Dynasty, achieved some success, and how to promote new trends in order to promote the psychological construction, ethical construction, and even social construction, political construction, and economic construction in the arduous work of nation-building. The spirit of Christianity is worldly and combative, and it should be used to assist in the work of nation-building.</p>
<p>Judging from Bishop Tian Gengxin's election as a cardinal, it can be seen that the Catholic Church in China has gradually reached adulthood. We will not forget the good influence of the spread of Catholicism on our country's culture in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. We sincerely hope that from now on, Chinese Catholic believers will follow the instructions of the Pope of Rome in his Christmas message, and with the spirit of cooperation, goodwill, and mutual trust, they can make outstanding contributions to the work of building a new China and a new world, so that the world that the Pope calls "post-war" but still without "peace" will surely enter a day of true peace.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the listed price of gold in the capital was changed to 80,000 to buy and 80,010 to sell. In addition, the Tianjin price was reported to be small, and people felt disappointed again. Bullish investors at the customs front rushed to unload. Newspaper reports speculated a lot about the new exchange rate. The market opened in the morning and broke into the 800,000 mark. Many retail investors struggled to maintain their positions at lower prices, advancing and retreating around 780,000. However, large paper industry investors still came to cut their positions at noon, and finally the market could not hold on. Securities firms also followed the trend and sold off, dropping to 766,000. In the afternoon, the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, the price fell back 33,000 compared with the previous closing price. Gold jewelry was listed at 83,000, fine silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars still stood at around 450. The informal interest rate continued to be mediocre, ranging from about 8% to 10%. In general, the psychology was forced by the reduced listed buying price in the capital, plus a 92% discount on the exchange rate, and the interest in gold gradually dimmed again. The trend is still fluctuating.</p>
<p>The US dollar was affected by the small decline in the gold market. Reports speculated that the new exchange rate against the US dollar would suddenly be 1,300. Retail investors rushed to close their positions, and the price fell rapidly from 1,350 yuan. The selling pressure only stopped slightly when it retreated to below 1,310 yuan. Yarn mills continued to aggressively close their positions, and the situation improved slightly after that. In the afternoon, the price fluctuated around 1,320 yuan. As a result, it fell back 60 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were flat for old goods, while new goods fell by 2 yuan. There were not many transactions. Australian pounds were still around 2.5 US dollars, and British pounds were around 3.5 US dollars. However, rupees from Calcutta were traded at about 29 cents to the US dollar due to the sympathy of Indian people, and the price rose slightly.</p>

<p>Although the public debt market opened flat, news reports of Sun Ke caused people to be shaken again. Class C bonds gradually recovered to a high price of 735 yuan. Later, due to the weakness of the gold market, there were many investors who unloaded at high prices, and the price once again retreated to the 700 yuan mark. However, large investors in the industry were purchasing bonds after unloading gold. At noon, the price was still stable at around 710 yuan. As a result, it rose by 15 yuan to 65 yuan compared with the previous closing price. Miscellaneous brands did not keep up, and the price difference gradually widened.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were stable yesterday after being weak. After large investors in the industry unloaded gold, their surplus funds came to support the market again. At the noon close, there was a sudden appearance of more demand than supply. The market opened flat. Due to the decline in the gold market, many investors closed their positions. Yarn mills fell to 660 yuan, China Asia retreated to 660 yuan, and Qinxing broke into the 30 yuan mark. The market came to the rescue at six households and was pulled up at noon. However, the three small hot stocks did not keep up due to time constraints. As a result, yarn mills and US Asia were flat compared with the previous closing price, while the three small hot stocks fell by 2 yuan to 3.5 yuan. There were people searching for unpopular old stocks. The situation is still firm.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rose for several consecutive days, and there was supply at high prices. The gold market fell, and the problem of transfer of ownership was still not resolved. Although some companies could deal with stamps, people were still not satisfied. As a result, Jardine fell back more than 200 yuan, Jardine Brewery 30 yuan, paper industry 40 yuan, and each unpopular stock gradually showed more supply than demand.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Grain Prices Rise, Northern Sales are Active <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The rice market has northern sales in the interior, causing production prices to rise. There are still many southern Japonica rice arrivals in Shanghai, and the market situation is stable. Indica rice is scarce and prices are firm. Flour sales to the north continue, rising another 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean sales to Fujian have slowed down, and prices have risen by 100 to 200 yuan. Raw peanuts are sold as soon as they arrive, increasing the killing rate. The oil market has temporarily stopped in Ningbo, and the other chemical products are still sluggish, falling by several hundred yuan. Vegetable oil is dull, more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake has some transactions in Shantou, and the market is flat. Wine sales have turned bullish, and prices continue to rise by 500 yuan.</p>

<p>The white coal market is diverging. White coal lump stove coal users are selling very well, and the industry's absorption is strong, and the rising trend is reignited. White coal seams have seen a sharp decline in sales and transactions have gradually become sparse since the coal briquette factory stopped purchasing. Market prices continue to decline. White coal cubs have active sales channels and are still outstanding. Bituminous coal trends are still stable, but factory sales are still sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Yarn Market is Stable, Inland Demand is Strong <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market started weak and ended firm. The price was not much different from the previous closing price. In the morning, due to the large number of dealers selling, 16-count Guangming once fell to 395,000 yuan. However, because the inland buyers' absorption was strong, the price gradually rose to 415,000 yuan. The closing price of 20-count yarn was also very stable. Fine yarn and double-strand yarn rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan because cloth factories were searching for them. If the factory owners do not release a large amount of goods for the time being, the current supply and demand situation in the market has entered a state of equilibrium.</p>

<p>Since last month, the Asia Petroleum Company has a large number of barrelled kerosene arriving in Shanghai. Therefore, they ordered a huge amount of kerosene cans from various can manufacturers, so the sales of 112-pound tinplate are very strong, and the price has also risen by about 20%.</p>

<p>Although there are many local weaving factories in the coarse cloth market, sales from Beijing and Shanghai have come to Shanghai to purchase in large quantities, and the cloth market has been slightly affected by this.</p>
<p>Walnuts have Tianjin ships arriving at the port, and delivery is imminent. The quantity is considerable, and the impact on sales is not small. Peanuts have low-grade goods arriving, and sales are also rare, and transactions are sparse.</p>
<p>The Hankou dealers of dyes purchase in tons, especially sulfide dyes, so the market price has risen sharply.</p>
<p>The silk market is down due to the decline in the gold market. Sellers are watching, and although there are many searchers, transactions are flat, and prices are stable. Zhili gan silk has risen by 50,000 yuan, because silk factories are interested in purchasing.</p>
<p>The tea market is still strong, but the sellers do not want to sell easily because there is not much stock in the market, so the market atmosphere is firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was flat due to the gold market. Japan, Great East, Southeast, Yuhua and other cigarette companies had shipments to supply, so the buying momentum was dull and the market was soft. However, Lao Dao and Fairy cigarettes are still stable.</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) More than 190 units of industrial and commercial trade associations in this city, initiated by the Chamber of Commerce, jointly hosted the special envoys Ye and Niu (Special Envoy Qi abandoned due to illness), Deputy Minister Hong of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Inspector Cheng, and Director Wu of the Party Department, Special Commissioner Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other officials at Kang Le Restaurant at 3 PM yesterday. The officials praised the efforts of Shanghai industry and commerce in the eight years of the War of Resistance, and gave guidance on how to strengthen the organization of trade associations, how labor and management should cooperate, and how various groups should study and provide opinions on the government's current laws and regulations. Wang of the Silk Mill Trade Association, Pan Shihao of the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry and the Cotton Cloth Industry, and Jin Runxiang of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce all expressed their pain regarding their respective industries. Mr. Pan said that more than 3 million bolts of cotton cloth and more than 10,000 pieces of yarn that were forcibly taken away by the enemy puppets but not disposed of should be investigated and returned. He also said that the government should be flexible in handling the income tax problem caused by the conversion of the book capital amount of the city's industry and commerce, and not tax real money based on empty books. Mr. Jin also said that most industries are actually losing money, and advocated exempting income tax for the 34th year. This was unanimously supported by the entire group, and Mr. (blank) , the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce and the special transport guide of the Ministry of Social Affairs, accepted it on behalf of the officials and conveyed it to the central government. Mr. (blank) also gave guidance on the reorganization of various trade associations, saying that those who have participated in the puppet association, if there are no other active behaviors to help the enemy and puppets to harm industry and commerce and the people, if they are still elected by the industry, they can be elected. He hopes that the various associations will no longer wait and see, and organize and establish themselves as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Yarn and Cloth Merchants Investigate Old Warehouse Receipts <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Association Handles Registration</p>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) A considerable number of the warehouse receipts issued by yarn and cloth manufacturers in this city when the enemy puppets forcibly purchased yarn and cloth in August of the 32nd year are still in the hands of the receipt holders. They are divided into two parts, one is foreign merchants, such as Jardine Matheson, (blank) Chang, etc., and the other is Chinese merchants, such as China Textile, Tongyi, etc. The warehouse receipts issued by these manufacturers are usually circulated as bargaining chips without actual goods. There are also long-term warehouse receipts issued, waiting for the raw materials to be gradually replenished, and goods are distributed to the shareholders in batches. At that time, after the enemy puppets robbed them, the factory's inventory was forcibly purchased by them. Those who held receipts and were unwilling to do so did not go through the so-called application for sale procedures, nor did they receive the payment. Then, the warehouse receipts were naturally still in the hands of the original owners. And the manufacturers who issued empty warehouse receipts had no goods to apply for sale at all, and did not notify the receipt holders one by one. Therefore, the total number of warehouse receipts issued at that time was difficult to match the total number of existing goods. Since the victory came, the enemy puppets surrendered, and the goods in the Jardine Matheson Lun Chang factory were already empty. However, the Cotton Cloth Association found that a part of the goods were confiscated by the enemy puppets and existed in Shanghai, intact. The Association has claimed rights against Jardine Matheson Lun Chang and others, and has reported it to the Enemy Puppet Property Processing Bureau, requesting its return. It is now setting up a special office in the Association to solicit receipt holders to issue receipts in preparation for future apportionment. As for the insufficient part, they will also demand compensation from the warehouse receipt issuing factory. As for the Zhongfang, Tongyi and other Chinese factories, their receipt holders are also asking the Association to organize registration and apply for the factory to distribute goods in groups. The Reorganization Committee of the Association revealed that the factory owners who issued empty warehouse receipts did not allow (blank) to take the opportunity to purchase yarn and cloth from the enemy puppets, and confused them. They expressed that they will be held accountable according to law.</p>

<p>The Chenyou Cup basketball league held two very exciting Group A matches yesterday afternoon. The air in the basketball hall was particularly lively. The Chenyou Cup is a great success before the open league. Here is a brief description of yesterday's battle:</p>
<p>The opening game was between Xie Xing and Liangxi. The two teams have equal reputations and were one of the most popular matches of the day. Unexpectedly, Liangxi's Yang Yuanlong and Yu Xunzi were absent, and Zhang Jinxuan played with illness, which inevitably weakened their strength. The referees Di Xianzhang and Xuan Hegao, Xie Xing's Liu Fushan scored first, and Chen Xuechong immediately returned the favor. Xie Xing continued to work hard, and Huang Quanlie once again took the lead. However, Liangxi was determined to fight to the death, and their desperate effort produced unexpected results. Chen Xuechong's shots were all accurate, so the score was very close, and the situation was very tense. In the first half, Xie Xing scored 17 points, and Liangxi scored 14 points, a difference of three points. In the second half, Xie Xing adopted a rotational strategy, frequently substituting players. Liangxi took advantage of their unstable formation and continued to press hard, catching up to 26 to 22. Xie Xing then used their ideal lineup, and once again took the lead. In the end, they defeated Liangxi with a score of 37 to 24, giving them hope of winning the third place.</p>
<p>The second game was between the victorious team Hualian and Chenyou. The outcome was expected. At the beginning of the game, Chenyou's Yao Wenyu and Liang Yongjia scored frequently, taking a 5 to 2 lead in an instant. This was the golden age of Chenyou yesterday. Afterwards, Hualian's Kong Guangyi and Wu Chengzhang scored, and Chenyou had no chance to raise their heads. In the first half, Hualian was ahead with a score of 13 to 5. After the break, they changed sides and fought again. Hualian played even better, and Chenyou declined rapidly. In a short time, Hualian took an absolute advantage with a score of 23 to 5. Hualian then made major adjustments to their reinforcements, and their momentum was still strong. Chenyou's soldiers had no fighting spirit. At the end of the game, Hualian won with a score of 42 to 17, maintaining their great record of six wins in six games.</p>
<p>Also, the schedule for the four Group B matches today is recorded below:</p>
<p>Vulture Team vs. Comet (Cup Division) 5:30 pm</p>
<p>Chen Huang vs. South China (Cup Division) 6:15 pm</p>
<p>Chen Hong vs. Youai (Chen Division) 7:00 pm</p>

<p>— Jin Guang</p>
<p>If everyone cannot deny that teachers also need to eat and support their families, then what is the reason for the particularly low and humble treatment of teachers?</p>
<p>I recently applied for a teaching position and succeeded smoothly in the discussion. The job is to teach Chinese in the first year of junior high school, and Chinese, history, and nature in the sixth grade of primary school, for a total of 1,100 minutes of class per week, which is 22 class periods. That is to say, I have to shout in the classroom for four hours every day. The salary is 500,000 puppet currency per month, with one free lunch. The location is at ×× Primary and Secondary School on Haige Road. I also asked about the number of students in the school. I was told that there are 46 students in the first year of junior high school and 39 students in the sixth grade. Frankly speaking, I already know that it will take me at least two or three hours every day to grade the papers and essays of these two classes at the fastest speed. Then, it is very obvious that my entire day is completely given to this school.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, my daily time is sold for 500,000 puppet currency (and I have to deduct 20% for the streetcar fee for work, so it can only be said to be 400,000) and one lunch. Disregarding the lives of all my family members, can I only use 500,000 puppet currency to feed me for the other two meals? — It is so embarrassing to say this, the lowest-priced meal in a small restaurant in the city now costs 150 legal currency (plus a tip), which costs 4,500 legal currency per month, which is 900,000 puppet currency! But let's just say that we always need to be humble when eating at a small restaurant, and it's always cheaper to cook at home, and cut this number in half, which is still 450,000. Then how will the remaining 50,000 puppet currency be used to allocate thirty breakfasts?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to meet a student who was already working as a clerk in a small shop. I asked him about his recent work, and finally asked about his salary. The answer on the salary side was that the store provided three meals a day, and the salary was 15,000 legal currency per month — I couldn't help but shout out loud; is this my shame, or the shame of those who proudly bear the title of educator?</p>
<p>This time I am planning to change my direction of survival — I can tell you all that I have spent five years in the teaching profession — this is less about my lack of integrity, and more about the inevitable consequence of being destroyed by the unreasonable treatment of education!</p>
<p>Moreover, I no longer want to be exploited layer by layer by those "hypocritical" "educators." The school's fees are not low!</p>

<h3 id="e83">President Song Determined to Investigate Illegal Reception of Enemy Property: Soldiers Occupying Ship Already Legally Handled <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) President Song's visit to Shanghai is purely to review the general enemy and puppet properties received in this city and their handling. He attaches even greater importance to the various illegal incidents that occurred during the reception of certain received warehouses or during the reception itself, and is taking detailed reports from all relevant parties before conducting a thorough investigation. Mr. Song's stay in Shanghai is very brief. He will fly to Tianjin, Beijing and Qingdao in a day or two to inspect.</p>
<p>Continued Meetings with Military Leaders</p>

After the officials gathered, the military and government leaders' meeting, centered on President Song, immediately began and did not disperse until 1:00 p.m. According to related sources, the main topic of the meeting was to thoroughly review the work of receiving properties in Shanghai. The city's reconstruction and the relief of unemployed workers were also discussed. According to those close to Mr. Song, Mr. Song's visit was to inspect the current situation in Shanghai, with particular emphasis on the reception of properties. All illegal actions will be thoroughly investigated. At 4:00 p.m., he also met with Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Xu presented a detailed report on the reception of enemy and puppet ships and the recent handling situation for review. It was also learned that when the Bureau took over the enemy properties "Sanfeng Maru" and "Qiandao Maru", it was forcibly occupied by mixed troops, and even secretly sailed to the fish market, intending to escape. After Mr. Song received the report in Chongqing, he telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to send troops on the 18th of this month to arrest the illegal military officer Li Xiangting and five others, who are currently detained in the detention center of the headquarters, awaiting legal proceedings.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu Shiping, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, as of now, about 1,200 important personnel from various departments of the Executive Yuan have arrived in the capital using China National Aviation Corporation's special planes and ships. It is expected that the National Government will be able to return to the capital as scheduled next year.</p>
<p>More Than 100 Manufacturers Request Return of Properties</p>
<p>More than 100 manufacturers in this city, including the Da Zhong Dyeing Factory and the Minxing Paper Mill, were occupied and forced to cooperate by the enemy and puppet forces during the War of Resistance. Now that the mountains and rivers have been restored, they have requested the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to return the properties to facilitate their early resumption of work. However, the Bureau rejected the request, stating that the central government has explicitly stipulated that "all properties that have been acquired by Japanese and puppet forces, whether forced or not, belong to the central government." After receiving the instructions, the manufacturers convened an emergency meeting and decided to appeal to the two envoy offices of Ye and Niu, who were visiting Shanghai from the central government, and to submit requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Shanghai Municipal Government for early return. Representatives were also sent to President Song to make a statement.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters suggested to the Municipal Government to rename one of the city's major thoroughfares to Roosevelt Road to commemorate the "Friend of China." The support of the allied United States was indispensable in the war against Japan. Mr. Roosevelt has always cared for our country, and the government and the public unanimously admire him. This is completely different from the motivation of using foreign names for roads during the old concession era.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Shipowners Association Drafts Opinions on Shipping Rehabilitation Measures, Striving for Sound and Rational Shipping <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the War of Resistance, shipping on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast has completely stalled. Most shipping organizations have relocated to the rear, and many ships supplying military transport have been bombed and destroyed by the enemy. Before victory, shipping companies in the rear, such as the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Minsheng Industrial Company, and Dada and Datong companies, borrowed large amounts of loans from the Ministry of Communications at very low interest rates. These large sums were borrowed by the Ministry of Communications on behalf of the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, and the Central Trust Bureau and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The Ministry of Communications subsidized the amount of interest shortfall borne by each company. After victory, it subsidized the tools for the rehabilitation of military and public personnel. On the one hand, the shipping industry also began to rehabilitate, and the Shipowners Association drafted a "Statement of Opinions on Urgent Measures for Shipping Rehabilitation" and submitted it to the government for approval. The original text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Outline of Objectives</p>
<p>(A) (Objectives) (1) To enable the existing means of water transportation to be fully and reasonably utilized to facilitate the transportation of goods and passengers. (2) To enable the various shipping companies that have suffered heavy losses to quickly revive with government assistance. (3) To enable foreign businessmen to understand our country's shipping policy and, within the scope of respecting our country's territorial water sovereignty, assist in shipping construction with capital and technology. (B) (Outline of Measures) (1) All ships and other assets originally owned by shipping companies registered with the Ministry of Communications or other shipowners that were forcibly occupied, requisitioned, or otherwise seized by the enemy puppets during this war shall be immediately reported and returned. The previous managers of the ships, or other personnel or shareholders representing the company, who are deemed by the government to have collaborated with the enemy, shall be dealt with by the government. The rights and interests of all shareholders who have not collaborated with the enemy shall be protected in accordance with the law. (2) For all ships that were requisitioned, sunk, blocked in port, destroyed, or otherwise lost due to war during this war, the government shall immediately allocate compensation from the ships and other shipping assets received from the enemy puppets. (3) When the aforementioned ships and other shipping assets cannot be divided, joint compensation may be given to several shipping companies or several ships that have suffered losses, and the shipping organizations shall be supervised to form joint institutions to accept management. In addition, all ships and other shipping assets that have been signed over to the enemy puppets and will be compensated in the future shall be handed over to various private shipping companies for operation as much as possible through leasing or consignment. (4) For all kinds of ships, warehouses, and docks that have suffered losses in this war and have been in disrepair for a long time and are needed for rehabilitation, the government shall supervise and set a time limit for repairs. The required repair costs shall be provided by the government in accordance with the loan measures for salvaging and repairing old ships sunk in the Yangtze River, and shall be transferred to the Four Banks Joint Office for lending. The main conditions are as follows: A. The weekly interest rate is six percent. The government will subsidize the amount exceeding the bank interest. B. The principal repayment period is three years from the date of repair and operation (it is proposed to change it to five years). C. The repaired ships, warehouses, or docks shall be used as collateral. (5) Establish a loan law for purchasing and building ships. The national treasury and national banks shall raise a loan fund sufficient to purchase and build more than 300,000 tons of ships for long-term loans, and the national treasury shall subsidize the interest. (6) Inland river and coastal routes shall be encouraged for private operation, and ocean routes shall be operated by the state with regular mail ships as a model. (7) Navigation between inland rivers and coastal routes and commercial ports shall be limited to ships of national registry to consolidate national navigation rights and protect the fledgling shipping industry. (8) State-owned and private shipping companies may utilize foreign capital, and the government or national banks may guarantee it. There is no restriction on foreign capital loans. Foreign shares shall not exceed 49% of the total capital. All shipping companies with foreign shares shall register with the competent authorities in accordance with our country's newly promulgated Company Law and shipping registration laws. Shipping companies that have previously registered with our country's competent authorities and obtained licenses, all of their ships shall be regarded as our country's ships and must fly our national flag. (9) Restore Wusong Merchant Marine School and expand it. Establish research institutes, university departments, and training courses. Encourage universities with suitable characteristics to add specialized departments to cultivate talents in navigation, marine engineering, shipbuilding, port management, and shipping management. For the training of grassroots crew members, crew training institutes may be established. (10) Strive for the rationalization of shipping operations, coordinate labor-management relations, promote cooperation among the industry, improve shipping organizations, appropriately allocate routes, and evaluate freight and passenger fares.</p>

<p>Sharp Decline in Water Level in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has declined sharply recently. The shipping industry in this city has received a statement from the Hankou-Yichang-Xiangtan Water Diversion Association stating that the water level in Shashi is only 7.2 feet. Vessels in the Hankou-Yichang section cannot currently exceed 9 feet in draft, otherwise they will not be able to navigate.

<h3 id="e90">Higher Court Criminal Division Continues Trial of Traitors, Gu and Lin Still Trying to Argue Their Way Out of Crime <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At 10:00 am yesterday, the First Criminal Division of the Higher Court of the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao opened two traitor investigation hearings under the chairmanship of Investigator Cao Jun, namely the case of Gu Youtang [translator]'s deceit of Chinese workers, and the case of Lin Zhixing [translator]'s bullying and extortion. Both defendants hired lawyers to defend them, and the witnesses summoned by the court also arrived on time to testify.</p>
<p>Soliciting Chinese Workers to Work for the Enemy</p>
<p>Gu Youtang, a translator, is 37 years old and from Ningbo. He lived in Japan around 1926, worked as a chef, and was proficient in Japanese. He returned to Shanghai in September 1937 and returned to his hometown. In the summer of 1938, he made a living by selling straw mats. In April 1939, he entered the stack room of the [Jiangnan Shipyard Pudong Branch] managed by the Japanese merchant Mitsubishi Corporation through the introduction of Japanese Yoshimura Kazuo, and later served as a translator in the factory. In April 1943, [Mitsubishi Corporation] was entrusted by the Japanese to recruit Chinese workers to work in Singapore. The foreman of the factory, Chen Shuiyao, came forward and signed a contract with the deceived Chinese workers, stating that the term would be one year. At that time, there were more than 200 deceived Chinese workers. When "recruiting" workers and "comforting" the families of workers, Gu Youtang served as the translator. Currently, the batch of Chinese workers has not had any letters. After the High Prosecutor's Office investigated and confirmed the case, it was reopened yesterday. Witnesses Zhang Afeng and Jin Du reported that their husbands were deceived and left Shanghai in June of the year before last, and their whereabouts are still unknown. When asked, the defendant said that he only served as a translator and had nothing to do with the recruitment of Chinese workers, and had resigned in May of this year. After 11:00 am, the court ordered Gu to be remanded and rescheduled for retrial. Gu's arrest process is as follows: In August of this year, after Japan surrendered, many families of deceived workers crowded to Chen Shuiyao's house to demand people. Because Chen was cunning and changeable, he had already fled. So they went to Gu Youtang's house. At that time, there was a conflict with Gu, so the police discovered it and took him to the police station, and then transferred him to the court.</p>
<p>Habitually Extorting and Bullying Villagers</p>
<p>Lin Zhixing, 46 years old, from Guangzhou, had worked as a barber in Japan for many years. In February of this year, he served as a translator for the Japanese "Gendarmerie" in Zhenru. He bullied the villagers by relying on the evil power of the Japanese army and habitually extorted money from rice merchants in the town. Prosecutor Lin of the High Prosecutor's Office investigated the case and has concluded it and filed a public prosecution according to law. The main points of the indictment are roughly as follows: The defendant used his position in the Japanese military agency to extort the profits from rice merchants Zhong Jikui and Zhang Xing in Zhenru. Furthermore, on July 6 of this year, because the extortion failed, he even colluded with the "Gendarmerie" intelligence officers Shen Ajin, Liang Bingyan, and Xin Liquan and others to insult and beat Zhong. He should be deemed to have committed the crime of colluding with the enemy and serving in a military position in violation of Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, and the crime of extortion by force under Article 55 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed. Investigator Cao asked Lin, and Lin denied the extortion, claiming that it was a "reward." The plaintiff, Zhong Jikui, described the process in court and said that if it was a "reward" nature, it should be voluntary, so why did he report it to the police? At 11:15 am, the court ordered that the case was still awaiting deliberation and would be retried at a later date.</p>

<p>Christmas has passed in a peaceful atmosphere. After spending three days of revelry, the US troops have officially returned to work in their offices. In Shanghai alone, the US troops spent tens of thousands of US dollars on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Christmas gifts shipped from the United States kept the staff of the US military post office very busy. The business of various dance halls, bars, and restaurants was the best during these two days. In places of wine and revelry, a cup of tea costs 3,000 yuan. A small cup of brandy, which is not a handful, costs 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Western meals in dance halls have increased to 25,000 yuan per person. The new film "Thousands Cheer" starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, and "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves", which was previously shown in Kunming and Chongqing, sold very well, and "black tickets" were found in all three shows. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve, there were several light rains. Groups of three to five American soldiers, half-drunk and drunk, crossed the road, singing "Silent Night" and "We Three Kings" and "The Holy Child was born in Bethlehem" together. However, today the Christmas banquets have gradually subsided, and the US troops are preparing to celebrate New Year's Day in 1946.</p>

After Wang Yansong and Luo Qinghua delivered welcome speeches in succession, Special Envoy Niu stood up and said: Mr. Ye Chucang was unable to attend due to illness and was represented by his brother. It is an honor for me and others to come to Shanghai this time to gather with workers from all walks of life and talk about the feelings of being separated for eight years. Now I urge the seniors of various associations to express their opinions so that we can gather the points that should be improved and quickly report them to the Central Government. The Supreme Economic Commission, which was recently established in the capital, is for the purpose of promoting China's post-war economic recovery. I hope that all seniors will give us more cooperation.</p>
<p>Speeches from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Next, Deputy Minister Hong spoke, roughly divided into (1) the organizational issues of various trade associations. The current stage is still a transitional period, and further improvements are needed in the future. (2) Industrial and commercial industries should prioritize the central laws and regulations to build a normal economic system for post-war society. (3) If there are any questions about the laws and regulations formulated by the government, I hope to raise them for discussion. Next, Supervisory Commissioner Cheng Cangbo gave a speech, saying (1) what the rear area has not been able to solve in recent years is the issue of stabilizing prices, which is due to the collapse of the trade association organization. (2) The current difficulty in the recovered area is the issue of taking over, which is also because our trade association did not ask in advance when taking over. Next, Wu Shaoshu gave a speech, hoping that the industrial and commercial circles would assist in the construction. Wu Kaixian thanked all circles for their assistance during his underground work. Subsequently, Lu Jingshi, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, saying: As a result of my contact with industrial and commercial industries, I have obtained a secret, that is, we should be sincere and trustworthy in handling affairs, and labor and management must cooperate absolutely in order to realize the industrialization of China. Then, representatives of various associations such as silk factories, machinery dyeing and weaving, and paper industries, Wang Huanan, Pan Shihao, Jin Runxiang, Chen Shu, and others described the oppression of the enemy puppets and the actual damage suffered during the Anti-Japanese War, and offered opinions on the revival of industrial and commercial industries.

<h3 id="e96">Military Affairs Commission Telecommunications Supervisory Section Strictly Enforces Radio Management Supervising Communications to Protect Citizens' Legitimate Rights <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Telecommunications Supervisory Section of the Military Affairs Commission, originally located in Kunming, has now moved to Shanghai due to the relocation of the transportation and telecommunications center. Last month, the section received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to move to Shanghai and coordinate its work within the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. It specializes in managing radio stations, radios, and equipment manufacturers in the city, aiming to supervise and guide normal communications and protect the legitimate rights and interests of law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>Application for Registration Required Within One Month</p>
<p>The section began operations at the beginning of this month. Regarding the management of radios in the city, it is stipulated that all users who have radios must apply within one month to obtain a radio installation permit. Furthermore, users who need to purchase radios must first fill out an application form, which, after being approved by the section, will be issued a purchase permit for door-to-door delivery. Those who fail to register and obtain an installation permit within the specified time will be fined and ordered to stop listening, or their equipment will be confiscated. Only after completing the procedures or making corrections will they be allowed to continue listening or have their equipment returned. Regarding radio equipment, the garrison headquarters has been ordered to strictly control it and has also ordered manufacturers dealing in radio equipment to register with the section within one month and obtain a special business license after approval. Those who do not have a special permit are not allowed to concurrently operate in radio equipment. The sale of materials must be based on a purchase permit issued by the section. Because the status of radio is extremely important today, militarily, aircraft and warships must use radio to transmit messages, and even bandits can use radio. Therefore, the authorities must pay special attention to it so that manufacturers or those who do not know who the purchasers are do not mistakenly sell equipment to criminals, endangering the country.</p>
<p>Calling a Tea Party for Manufacturers</p>
<p>To clarify the meaning of this measure to the radio industry, the garrison headquarters held a tea party for radio equipment manufacturers in the city at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday to discuss everything.

Chief Cheng delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the Telecommunications Supervisory Section of the Inspection Department of the Headquarters in managing radio equipment is: (1) to protect the legitimate rights of manufacturers from the government's perspective; (2) manufacturers must also safeguard national interests, abide by government laws and regulations, assist in implementation, eliminate traitors, and prevent radio from being used by criminals to harm the country. Subsequently, the manufacturers spoke enthusiastically, and under the principle of mutual trust and cooperation, they discussed all technical issues related to the control of radio equipment, dispersing happily at 12:00 PM.</p>

However, the work of salvaging the ship's body will take another one or two days because special tools are needed to successfully float the ship's body. The cause of the accident has not yet been determined and will only be clear after the ship's body is salvaged. Furthermore, the body of Captain Chen of the Lingjiang has not yet been found, and the injuries of ship police Zhao Zhi are quite serious, but there have been no changes so far.</p>
<p>More Bodies Found from the Hua</p>
<p>The Hua, which sailed from Min to Shanghai, suddenly sank on the 12th on the steel sand surface outside the Wusongkou. The next day (the 10th), five bodies were found on the Jiuduansha of Wusong and were retrieved and discovered. Four more bodies were found at Baqi Fei the day before yesterday, and two more were found yesterday, totaling eleven bodies. The aforementioned bodies have now been coffined and buried locally.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that enemy and puppet ships are often privately transferred and indiscriminately bought or leased by anyone regardless of their background, causing difficulties during registration, in order to prevent abuses, hopes that all shipping companies will not arbitrarily buy, sell, or lease unregistered ships without ownership documents. Even when encountering foreign ships, one should investigate their origin and ownership documents in advance to avoid misleading oneself.</p>

<p>Also, yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, a "Guo Yi Yi Qi Ling Liu Hu" car was speeding from south to north on Jiangxi Road when it crossed Nanjing Road. Because the car was traveling too fast, it could not brake in time and crashed onto the sidewalk. The Xietai Money Exchange store, located at the corner of the intersection, was almost hit. A bicycle parked in front of the store was crushed and completely wrecked. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Ministry of Audit Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Check Financial Affairs of Various Administrative Agencies <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zuli of the Shanghai District Circuit Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit recently told reporters: The Ministry has relayed Chairman Chiang's handwritten instruction that the personnel sent to take over the recovered areas are carrying cash, which is causing many problems. In addition, since Shanghai has just been recovered, the government's audit agencies have not yet been established, and the supervision of the accounts of various agencies cannot be delayed. Therefore, I was ordered to come to Shanghai to handle audit matters. Up to now, I have successively checked more than 20 units, including various bureaus and offices of the municipal government, central tax agencies, special envoys of various ministries and commissions of the central government stationed in Shanghai, parks, and the Central China Railway Management Committee, etc., to verify the organizations of the agencies. Most of the organizations of the checked agencies have not been determined, and the budgets have not been established. As a result, there is abuse of personnel, huge expenditures, and borrowing of funds, far exceeding the actual funding issued by the central government, which is a common problem. The situation regarding the handling and takeover of enemy and puppet property is the most complicated, with many units. Just in terms of the agencies responsible for the takeover by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, there are more than 200. Whether the management of the takeover of property is proper and whether there is concealment or smuggling, the administrative authorities should strictly check and expand the investigation methods to strengthen supervision for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Reports on Distribution of Relief Supplies and Assistance in Industrial and Commercial Revival <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Translation and Compilation Office of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration hosted the Shanghai press at 3:00 PM yesterday on the second floor of the office to report on the establishment of the administration, the quantity of relief supplies that had arrived in China, and their distribution. More than 40 reporters from various newspapers attended. The director of the Translation and Compilation Office, Shen Weitai, chaired the meeting. Mr. Shen first reported on the organizational content and responsibilities of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and then described the nature of the administration, its authority, and its status equal to that of the ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[UNRRA] After the UNRRA supplies arrive in China, they are received by the administration, and all relief matters in China are handled by the administration. The UNRRA Relief Office in China is only in an advisory and assisting position. In addition, the administration has hired many foreign experts to assist in the technical work of various departments.</p>
<p>The Administration Has Four Offices and Four Departments</p>
<p>The administration has four offices and four departments. The four offices are Storage and Transportation, Distribution, Finance, and Rehabilitation. The four departments are Investigation, Translation and Compilation, General Affairs, and Accounting. A Health Committee is also established. In the recovered areas of the country, fifteen relief sub-administrations have been established, and the Shanghai Sub-Administration is one of them, responsible for handling relief matters in various places. Regarding the sale of supplies, it is handled by the Finance Office. However, supplies distributed to each sub-administration can also be sold by the sub-administration, but it must be approved by the Finance Office and personnel must be sent to supervise. The administration originally moved to Chongqing. Now, because the national government will move to Nanjing, it will move to Nanjing. Some personnel have already arrived in Nanjing. However, Shanghai is the business center of the administration, and most of the UN supplies will be unloaded in Shanghai. Therefore, the business of various departments will also be moved to Shanghai. The Shanghai office of the administration will be responsible for coordinating the national relief business.</p>
<p>A Total of 90,000 Tons of Supplies Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Up to now, thirteen UNRRA relief supply ships have arrived in Shanghai. The supplies on eleven of them have been completely unloaded, and one is currently being unloaded. A total of 90,000 tons of supplies have been unloaded. The types and quantities are as follows: (1) Food: 57,669 tons, including 37,184 tons of wheat, 28,787 bags of flour, 12,738 tons of miscellaneous, 11,545 boxes of standard nutritional rations, 4,050 boxes of coarse milk powder, 6,150 boxes of fine milk powder, and 3,124 boxes of dried beans; (2) Clothing: 87,068 packages of old clothes, 8,905 packages of old shoes, 600 bundles of gloves, 4,495 bags of cotton, 1 box of needles, and 9 bags of thread; (3) Building materials: 81 tons of cement; (4) Medical and health equipment: 215 tons, including 100 tons of DDT, 65 tons of medical equipment, 0.04 tons of penicillin, and 50 tons of milk and milk powder; (5) Transportation equipment: 2,252 tons and 566 vehicles; (6) Agricultural equipment: 864 barrels of insecticides and fungicides, and 3 boxes of veterinary equipment; (7) Fishing equipment: 49 refrigerators, and 1,902 rolls of hemp rope; (8) Industrial and mining equipment: 82 tons of steel bars, and 60 tons of air purifiers; (9) Water conservancy equipment: 266 tons; (10) Welfare equipment and miscellaneous: 188 tons of stationery and 47 boxes of scientific instruments.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Supplies</p>
<p>After receiving the above relief supplies, the administration has distributed them to various sub-administrations and agencies for relief purposes. The distribution volume and types are as follows: (1) Food: 1,928 tons to North China, 7,277 tons to Central China, 6,527 tons to South China, 399 tons for rehabilitation, 23,584 tons for finance, 756 tons to the Health Administration, and 8 tons to UNRRA; (2) Clothing: 74,000 packages of old clothes, 4,500 pairs of old shoes, 1 box of needles, and 9 bags of thread to North China. 10,068 packages of old clothes, 2,500 pairs of shoes, and 1,050 pairs of gloves to Central China. 3,000 packages of old clothes, 1,500 pairs of shoes, and 4,495 bags of cotton to South China. Other places are still being distributed; (3) Building materials: All cement is distributed to the Finance Office; (4) Medical aspects: 50 tons of milk powder has been distributed to health agencies in twelve provinces for use. The DDT has not yet been distributed. The 65 tons of equipment has not yet been distributed from UNRRA to the administration; (5) Transportation equipment: 70 vehicles to North China, 149 vehicles to Central China, 133 vehicles to South China, 38 vehicles to the Storage and Transportation Office, 4 vehicles to the Finance Office, 69 vehicles to the Ministry of Transportation, and 76 vehicles to UNRRA. 300 tons of transportation equipment to Central China, 183 tons to the Finance Office, 1,602 tons to the Ministry of Transportation, 20 tons to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and 121 tons to UNRRA. There are still 26 tons being distributed; (6) Agricultural equipment and (7) Fishing equipment are all handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; (8) Industrial and mining equipment: All steel pipes are handed over to the Finance Office, and air purifiers are being distributed; (9) Water conservancy equipment: 173 tons to the Water Conservancy Committee, and 93 tons to the Finance Office; (10) Stationery: 78 tons to the Finance Office, and 54 tons to UNRRA. One box is still being distributed by UNRRA.</p>
<p>Surplus Supplies Will Also Be Distributed</p>
<p>In addition, among the supplies left by the U.S. military in Kunming, Guiyang, Zhijiang, and Liuzhou, there are 2,000 tons of medical equipment, which are now being received by the administration and distributed to the Guangxi and Henan sub-administrations and health agencies and hospitals in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. Hospitals that receive the allocated medical equipment must comply with the following three principles stipulated by the administration: (1) Emergency relief and treatment of patients is completely free; (2) Epidemic prevention is completely free; (3) A 10% quota of free treatment should be set up for general patients.</p>
<p>Relief and Rehabilitation Are Integrated</p>
<p>Mr. Shen finally stated: The supplies provided by UNRRA to China, a part of which is sent to refugees, and a part of which is sold publicly to adjust market supply, so that people who do not need direct relief but have purchasing power can purchase the supplies they need in the market and prevent unreasonable price increases. However, the administration's sale of supplies cannot be regarded as a commercial organization because the administration assists in cultivating the recovery of agriculture, industry, and commerce under the principle of not affecting the market, hindering agricultural and industrial production, or international trade. For example, in the restoration of the Shanghai textile industry, the administration provided a large amount of wool and cotton to assist in its rapid restoration. The funds obtained from the sale of these supplies will still be used for various emergency relief projects in the recovered areas. The total value of UNRRA relief supplies to China is approximately US$945 million. On average, each person in the country receives only US$2 of supplies. Therefore, the administration plans to use these supplies and the funds obtained from their sale as much as possible for post-war active relief work. For refugee relief, it is decided to implement work-for-relief to enable those in need of relief to repair roads, houses, etc., integrating post-war and relief. It can make a lasting contribution to society, and those who are relieved can obtain work, and food, clothing, and shelter can all be solved.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Renlin Continued to Report</p>
<p>Next, the Deputy Director of the Shanghai Sub-Administration, Wang Renlin, described the organization and work of the Shanghai Sub-Administration. It is said that the position of the Shanghai Sub-Administration is the same as that of other sub-administrations, and the supplies it distributes are also allocated by the General Administration. However, Shanghai is a large port, and various relief supplies are received in Shanghai and then distributed to the sub-administrations. (A) Since its establishment, the relief supplies received by the Shanghai Sub-Administration are as follows: (1) 4,400 tons of flour, 8,521 boxes of Type C military rations, 327 boxes of beef, 227 boxes of various canned fruits have been received, 3,000 packages of old clothes, 1,500 pairs of old shoes, 200 bottles of penicillin. (2) Materials being received include 449 boxes of macaroni, 200 boxes of eggs, 1,564 boxes of dried beans, 20 trucks, 6 staff passenger cars, 200 bundles of gloves. The processing of the above materials (ie, those that have been delivered to various groups) is distributed as follows: 25,576 bags of flour, 7,465 boxes of Type C rations, 603 packages of old clothes, and 38 bottles of penicillin.</p>
<p>Progress of Health and Relief Affairs</p>
<p>(B) The work of the Shanghai Sub-Administration Health Department: (1) 624 bags of flour and 226 boxes of Type C rations have been issued to various hospitals (all based on the number of free beds) for free relief patients to be admitted (27 people before and after). (C) The work of the Relief Department: The work of the Relief and Rehabilitation Office is very temporary, so the principle is to assist the original local institutions and make the most of the time. Currently, 25,576 bags of flour have been distributed to 57 relief organizations. The special work of the Relief Department is to relieve displaced people returning to their hometowns. Currently, two reception centers for returning overseas Chinese have been established, and the third one will also be established. According to statistics, there are a total of 1,500 Jews, 2,500 Central Europeans, 100 refugees, 1,357 Japanese returnees, and 450 Philippine returnees waiting for relief here. In addition to travel expenses, each person sent back to their hometown receives 300 yuan per day for meals and 1,000 yuan for pocket money. (D) Winter relief work has also begun. (1) A large amount of supplies will be supplied to the Winter Relief Committee established by the Municipal Government, and a subsidy of 1.3 million yuan will be given. (2) 90 bags of flour and 60 boxes of biscuits will be supplied to each porridge distribution point (13 in total) per month. (E) The work of the Social Department: Supplying the Temporary Relief Committee for Unemployed Workers (currently there are 90,000 unemployed people) with 9,000 tons of flour, enough for three months.</p>
<p>Items Urgently Needed Have All Been Distributed</p>
<p>(F) The items most urgently needed in Shanghai at present have been requested by the Shanghai Sub-Administration from the General Administration: (A) (1) 9,000 tons of flour, (2) food for refugees and overseas Chinese for three months, 9,375,000 catties of flour, (3) 50,000 sets of winter clothes, (4) 200 sewing machines, (5) 3,000 tons of canned food, (6) building materials for building five shelters, (7) 8,000 beds, (B) Various agencies and groups seek relief supplies, (1) fuel, (2) clothing and bedding, (3) corrugated iron and cement mixers, (4) seeds and fertilizers, (5) wood, (6) fishing boats and fishing gear, (7) port application supplies, (8) cement, (9) power generation equipment for the Far East News Agency. (G) The results of the charity sale totaled 39,268,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Finance Office for distribution. Mr. Wang finally announced three points of the relief work policy: (1) simple and effective, (2) time-saving, (3) small-scale management.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Who Will Maintain Order in Theaters? <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Yang</p>
<p>On my third day in Shanghai, I went to the China Theater to see "Boy's Travels". Before the show started, an argument broke out in the seats next to me. The reason was that two soldiers without insignia were forcibly occupying seats that had already been sold. Two ladies were holding two tickets, hiding in a corner, watching the theater's front desk staff "negotiate" with these two comrades. They said a lot of nice things, only asking them to move two seats to watch the show, but these two comrades just sat there without moving. This angered a nearby audience member who interjected, saying that soldiers shouldn't be disorderly. The two comrades immediately became furious and asked loudly, "Where are you from?" The person didn't back down and admitted to being from the ××× army. The two comrades became even more enraged, repeatedly shouting, "Even the ××× army can't control me! No one can control me!" The entire theater was in an uproar, and many audience members left their seats to avoid the trouble. In the end, the theater owner had to bow and plead, promising to reserve those two seats for them to watch the show the next night, and only then did the two comrades leave grudgingly. I was a bit bewildered after seeing this, but my cousin, who has lived in Shanghai for a long time and went to the show with me, said, "This is very common. It's been like this ever since the victory."</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met the manager of a large theater who said he was planning to resign. I asked him why, and he said the main reason was that "recently, the front desk simply can't handle things."</p>
<p>"You mean there are too many people trying to watch shows for free?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, those with insignia want to sign for tickets, and those without insignia also want to sign for tickets. If you don't handle it well, they'll get violent! It's really unbearable."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Cultural Movement Committee convened a preparatory meeting for the drama and film association. Mr. Zhong, who is usually punctual, was an hour late this time. As soon as he entered the door, we could see that his usually calm and serene face was filled with indignation. "I was beaten," he said.</p>
<p>The details were as follows: Several military police officers went to the Victory Theater in Hongkou, wanting to go in to watch a show. A dispute arose because the front desk stopped them. The theater staff had to ask the manager, Mr. Gu, to come out. Mr. Gu very politely invited the comrades in military uniform to the manager's office upstairs, preparing to explain the reasons clearly. Unexpectedly, his first sentence, "We are all Chinese," annoyed the comrades. Without distinguishing between right and wrong, they slapped Mr. Gu a few times. Fortunately, others pulled them apart, and these comrades threatened to "come and beat up the theater tomorrow" and left. Poor Mr. Gu had good intentions, only wanting to say, "We are all Chinese, let's discuss things properly, there's no need to argue in front of Japanese residents," but he suffered this insult!</p>
<p>Our soldiers really lack opportunities for entertainment. There are simply no shows or movies in the camp, so they have to go to various theaters outside to find entertainment themselves. However, even so, it seems that some contact should be made, using formal procedures, asking the theater to either put on a complimentary show or issue complimentary tickets, and they shouldn't freely enter and exit, making it impossible to maintain order in the theater, let alone physically assault people. Even if we don't consider the feelings of the local people, so people don't say "With victory, order is gone," at least we should consider international reputation, so the tens of thousands of American soldiers and the Japanese returnees don't describe Shanghai as a city without order, right?</p>
<p>However, having said all that, who should maintain order?</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Record of the Trial of a Suicide Pilot <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>"One morning, a day or two before the American forces landed on Okinawa, we received orders saying that American transport ships had been spotted outside Ryukyu Island, and we were ordered to attack them."</p>
<p>"A total of eight of us set out. They gave me an old seaplane, the fastest speed of which was one hundred and twenty nautical miles per hour. It carried a 250-kilogram bomb, and the fuel was only enough for me to fly to the designated location."</p>
<p>"We also held some ceremonies when we set out, but there was nothing special about them. The commander stood next to a table covered with a white cloth. He handed each person a bottle of wine and wished us success when we drank it. I was the last one, but when I was supposed to shake hands with the commander, I panicked and just stuffed the bottle into my chest."</p>
<p>"When we took off, it was already dusk. We only flew halfway to Okinawa when the plane's propeller stopped working. The moonlight that night was very good. I wanted to find a place to land, but there was no land nearby, so I had to crash the plane into the sea. One of the sailors who was with me had just climbed out of the plane when the waves swept the plane away. We escaped with life jackets. We were together at first, but soon a wave came and swept the sailor away. He was probably swallowed by a carp. I later learned that there were many carp there."</p>
<p>"I struggled in the water for about seventeen hours, and I was a little unconscious two or three times. Finally, I drifted to a small island, a sandy island, the area of which was too small to even be on the map. The entire island had only sixty residents. They were very surprised to see that I hadn't been swallowed by carp. The residents on the island heard that the American forces were using radar, and they thought that any sound would be heard, followed by planes coming to bomb. So everyone didn't dare to speak loudly. Everyone was afraid that the crowing of the rooster would be heard by the radar, so they killed all the chickens, and everyone kept eating chicken. There was only one cow on the island, and because the cow mooed, it was also slaughtered."</p>
<p>The above is the confession of a Japanese suicide pilot. The pilot's name is Okamoto, only twenty-three years old, very handsome, and the trial was held in Tokyo. Okamoto still looked a little bewildered when he spoke.</p>
<p>Okamoto stayed on the sandy island until the end of the war before returning. Not long after he set out, his family received a mimeographed notice from the military with only a few simple words: "Comrade Okamoto crashed his plane into the enemy, perishing with the ship and achieving a heroic sacrifice." When he returned home, his family was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese suicide air force (called the "Kamikaze" by the Japanese), there used to be many magical legends: saying that this special attack team was treated very well, enjoying the pleasures of women before death and having solemn ceremonies after death, everything different from ordinary pilots. But according to Okamoto, these were all propaganda from the military, the purpose of which was nothing more than to comfort the families of the deceased, intimidate the Americans, and anesthetize Japanese youth. In reality, suicide pilots were treated the same as ordinary pilots, so they often clashed with their superiors. They thought the treatment should be different, they thought they should only crash into large battleships, and it wasn't worth risking their lives with those small boats. And they always harbored fear in their hearts, they knew that this suicide squad was just a desperate attempt and didn't do much good for the overall situation.</p>
<p>There were also reasons for the Japanese youth to join this suicide squad. According to Okamoto, after joining the suicide air force, he felt slightly relieved of some of his depression, because in this way he could get rid of many worries, at least there was something to do. They all hoped to be assigned a plane to participate in the war, but Japan was very short of planes. Only suicide pilots could be assigned a plane, so as a result, the more excellent pilots had no chance to fight, and a group of young people without combat experience had to join the suicide air force before they had the opportunity to participate in the war. Those who fought were all people without combat experience, which was also a reason for the failure of the Japanese air force.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Treatment of American Soldiers <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Kuang</p>
<p>There is no other country in the world that treats its soldiers better than the United States. The American people may tighten their belts and save money, but their troops must not be treated poorly. The completeness of their clothing goes without saying. In terms of diet alone, they have a full and reasonable allocation of daily heat units, protein, fat, vitamins, etc. In addition to their salaries, they also have settlement allowances. They can take newspapers and books at will without any charge. They can routinely buy a pack of chocolate candy for five cents and a can of twelve ounces of canned milk for ten cents. In addition, they can watch three movies a day. Needless to say, it's also free. They each have two pairs of shoes and socks, and a full set of coats and shirts. If anything is broken, they can exchange it for a new one at any time. Recently, one of my Filipino students joined the army. He said that clothing and other items alone filled two boxes.</p>
<p>When he first went in, the monthly salary was fifty dollars, plus a settlement allowance of twenty-five dollars a day. The above is naturally calculated in US dollars, and there are additional allowances for children. After serving for thirty years, they can eat "long grain" (receive a pension), so it's no wonder that Americans are happy to join the army.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government is particularly concerned about the careers of veterans who are about to be discharged. Recently, they tried to conduct a survey of occupations after demobilization. The majority of them expressed a strong interest in industries such as grocery stores, radio stations, etc. Some wanted to run chicken farms, some wanted to open tour guide companies and transportation companies, and some were preparing to raise sheep.</p>
<p>No matter which industry they plan to enter, the government always tries its best to provide them with the information needed for that industry so that they have something to refer to. If they lack economic resources, the government will advance the money first. The United States' preferential treatment of soldiers can be said to be meticulous.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Truman's Confidants <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yikun</p>
<p>President Truman's advisors are a large and interesting group. Since Truman took office in April, many people in Washington have wanted to know who are Truman's closest advisors.</p>
<p>The fact is, Truman does not have a "closest advisor". He accepts a lot of advice and shares a lot of secrets.</p>
<p>The President listens a lot and thinks a lot after listening. In the White House, he meets almost everyone; and nine out of ten of the people he meets have something to accuse or complain about.</p>
<p>He listens to the opinions of many people and then forms his own opinion. We know that Truman had many years of training in the Senate.</p>
<p>The people closest to the President on a daily basis are his three secretaries and two adjutants.</p>
<p>Charles Ross is Truman's press secretary, and he is always paying attention to the President's progress. Ross's job is to give the nation's readers and listeners the best impression of the President.</p>
<p>Matthew Connelly is the President's appointments secretary, a sharp-eyed, handsome New Englander who has long served as a government investigator. He is the buffer between the President of the United States and the loud and clamorous crowd who are shouting to tell the President a particular aspect of a particular issue.</p>
<p>The third secretary is William Hassett, the only White House veteran left over from the Roosevelt era. Hassett handles most of the President's letters, saving President Truman a lot of trouble due to his many years of work in this area.</p>
<p>The two adjutants are Major General Harry Vaughan and Captain James Vardaman. In World War I, Vaughan was a gunner under Truman, a very humorous person who keeps the President's mood happy forever. Vardaman is a naval reserve officer from Mississippi and a banker in St. Louis. He spares no effort in protecting the President.</p>
<p>However, these people who are close to the President have nothing to do with his major decisions.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Byrnes and John Snyder are perhaps the President's closest colleagues. Byrnes is from South Carolina and used to work with Truman in the Senate. He is one of the busiest people going in and out of the White House.</p>
<p>Snyder is another of the President's closest government officials. He is from Arkansas and is a successful Missouri banker. Recently, rumors have spread that Snyder is going back to the bank in St. Louis, but the President will never let him go easily.</p>
<p>Most Truman administration analysts have overlooked two of his most powerful friends - George Allen and Leslie Biffle.</p>
<p>Allen was a night clerk at a Washington hotel years ago and later served as a commissioner for the District of Columbia. He is now a very successful businessman and a shareholder in some of America's largest companies. If the President has a so-called closest advisor, Allen is undoubtedly one of them.</p>
<p>Biffle is the Secretary of the Senate, and the President often dines with him.</p>
<p>In addition, the President has many people close to him, but it would be impossible to list them all.</p>
<p>Finally, we must mention Postmaster General Robert Hannegan, who is very popular in the White House; nine out of ten of Hannegan's visits to the President involve major political events.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Broadcasting Aviation Teaching Materials <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>In this era of the "atomic" threat, the world is carefully researching and exploring various new weapons, and there is an extreme "sense of aviation" towards aviation construction.</p>
<p>The United States has incorporated aviation teaching materials into the school curriculum. In schools in Chattanooga and Tennessee, students are taught basic aviation knowledge at the age of seven. High-class students not only learn about the various parts of the aircraft structure but also are given the opportunity to fly in airplanes; flying in nearby cities to broaden their horizons and increase their knowledge of the "living" world is worthy of attention in education.</p>
<p>There are now approximately 28,000 public schools in the United States that have aviation courses. State-run aviation institutions provide assistance, and military and political authorities donate surplus aircraft for student experimentation.</p>
<p>Although our China is difficult to keep pace with Europe and the United States due to limited manpower and material resources, it should also encourage aviation industry within the possible scope, promote knowledge about aviation construction, and in schools, students can be generally taught preliminary aviation academics, such as aircraft principles, aviation history, aircraft model experiments, etc., teaching materials related to the flight industry, and social organizations can also hold aircraft exhibitions or use movies to promote aviation news and aviation construction knowledge, so that our "non-mechanized" nation can temporarily put down the pen and easily use axes and screws; strive for national industrialization and wash away the old "Confucian" thinking of the past.</p>
<p>Today, after the war, at the beginning of national construction, let us seize the great opportunity of a lifetime, broadcast aviation teaching materials, and promote the development of the flight industry to rebuild a new industrialized China.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Fate of the Bull <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Guo</p>
<p>The bull, as a symbol of male strength and vigor, is now facing a declining fate. The number of bulls in the world will gradually decrease because artificial insemination is becoming more common, and there are also unemployment problems in milk sheds.</p>
<p>Modern advanced artificial insemination can make a bull produce the equivalent of eighty bulls. Husbands are surplus and eliminated, and bulls are sent to slaughterhouses as veal before they grow up. In Nebraska, the number of bulls will decrease by at least three thousand, but the number of calves produced by artificial insemination is 20,000, increasing every year and reaching 70,000 in 1950.</p>
<p>Artificial insemination has many advantages. Generally speaking, bulls are relatively dangerous on livestock farms, and the cost of feeding them is also relatively high. For breeding, they are really a waste. Now, artificial insemination only costs a 5-yuan handling fee to hire a veterinarian, and extracting one cc of bull semen can be used for artificial insemination, so that each bull can fertilize at least 1,400 cows per year.</p>
<p>Another more important advantage is the selection of excellent germplasm to produce strong offspring. A good breeding bull is worth two thousand US dollars. A single farm may not be able to afford it, but it is more cost-effective to organize an association to jointly purchase and use it in a cooperative manner. Good dairy cows can produce a large amount of milk, so inferior breeds must be eliminated. This is eugenics for cows.</p>
<p>From this, it is not difficult to imagine the path and meaning of human eugenics and reproductive control in the future. Artificial insemination of the human body has already been successful. Some people have said that males are useless in the two sexes. In the future, only a few males or even no males will be needed to breed and reproduce offspring. Of course, human eugenics will never be like this. Bulls have a declining fate, but humans do not. Men don't need to panic now.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Receiving German Science <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Ming</p>
<p>The Nazi hegemony has been completely destroyed, but the glorious history of the Germanic nation still exists. Germany's contribution to human culture is still valued, especially in science, where Germany has always occupied a unique leadership position. This does not necessarily mean the excellence of the Germans, but German science does have a long history and a good tradition. This advantage should certainly not be destroyed at the same time as militarism, and for the sake of the future interests of mankind, it should be preserved and promoted.</p>
<p>Therefore, receiving German science today is indeed equivalent to receiving a great treasure trove of mankind. According to the United States, it has obtained many research results, completed or not, by German scientists, all of which are admirable and valuable masterpieces that have taken great pains.</p>
<p>Most of the research has military secrets. What can be announced now is a pilot's spring seat, which can be detached from the aircraft at will in an emergency at high altitude and fly through the air without danger even at an altitude of 20,000 feet and at speeds above 500 miles. This is a new invention that the United Nations has not yet succeeded in, and it will be of great benefit to the safety of air force personnel.</p>
<p>The various new and sophisticated instruments in the Zeiss Optical Research Institute are dazzling, and the United Nations bows to them. There is also a giant wind tunnel in the aeronautical testing laboratory, with a wind speed of up to 530 miles per hour, while in the United States, it can only reach 200 miles.</p>
<p>Most of the German scientists have expressed their willingness to surrender and continue to do research work for the United Nations. Before surrendering, they were ordered to destroy documents and research records, but most of them could not bear to do so, so they can still be preserved now. After the war, it is hoped that they will continue to work hard for peace, atone for their sins, and it is not too late.</p>

<p>— Yu Zhiling</p>
<p>Clearing Sewage, Garbage, and Excrement</p>
<p>Widely Establishing Public Toilets is Essential</p>
<p>The sanitary conditions of Shanghai have changed dramatically since the Japanese invaders ravaged the city. Because of the throngs of refugees and beggars, spitting, defecation, and urination occur everywhere. The patrol police along the roads cannot prohibit it, and the sanitation workers cannot sweep it away. This situation is not only related to hygiene but is also not conducive to the appearance of the city! Now that the municipal administration is being reformed and construction is just beginning, all sanitary matters must be thoroughly rectified and fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>In all parts of the city, the most unbearable things to see are sewage in ditches, piles of garbage, and excretion along the roads! Now the municipal authorities are rigorously implementing cleanliness and hygiene, carrying out a cleanliness campaign, investigating various neighborhoods and stores, ordering each to set up garbage cans and buckets for dumping at any time. From now on, the garbage problem can be solved. As for sewage in ditches, it should also be cleaned up as soon as possible. In low-lying areas, the road surface should be raised to prevent accumulation after rain, or open culverts to allow accumulated water to easily seep away. The ditches that have not been filled should be filled quickly to avoid rot and stench. This matter is being actively handled by the Public Works Bureau, and it should be a permanent solution. However, urination and defecation along the roads are difficult to prevent because there are so many beggars and pedestrians who scatter at any time. Moreover, the matter of urination and defecation is inevitable for people. The city area is vast, the streets are tidy, and there are very few toilets in the neighborhoods. Pedestrians and beggars are forced to urinate and defecate anywhere due to urgency. This is also human nature. The so-called taking risks in desperation, how can one choose in urgency! This fault is not only in the person urinating and defecating, but the health authorities should also bear their responsibility.</p>
<p>Based on my own humble opinions, I would like to ask the authorities to widely establish toilets in all districts of the city to reduce the harm of urination and defecation! In the past, Westerners governed the concessions, because they thought that setting up more toilets was unsightly and detrimental to hygiene, which caused great inconvenience to citizens. It should be known that urination and defecation are called "excrement" and "urine," so convenience is the priority! Setting up fewer toilets for the sake of cleanliness will increase pollution due to the lack of toilets. The more toilets there are, the cleaner the roads are. It can be seen that the method of cleanliness does not lie in fewer toilets but in more toilets and proper management.</p>
<p>Now it is proposed that a public toilet be set up every mile or so in the city area, and men's and women's toilets must be separated and set up together to facilitate pedestrians. All triangular open spaces at intersections of various roads should be built as public toilets, making use of wasteland and killing two birds with one stone. After public toilets are widely established, if there are still people urinating and defecating on the roadside, all patrol police or those responsible for cleaning the area must send them to the police station for punishment. In this way, the city appearance will naturally be tidy. This is the fundamental way to clean the entire city. I hope the authorities will take action immediately.</p>

<p>A letter from the Social Affairs Department of Nanyang Hospital states: "To the Editor, on the evening of the 19th of this month, Liu Yuquan and Liu Yukun, who work as rickshaw pullers, pulled something that looked and tasted like salt. They divided it up and took it home to use as salt, resulting in nine family members being poisoned. Seven people were sent to other hospitals, and Yuquan and Yukun were sent to our hospital, on the verge of death. After emergency treatment in our hospital, they recovered completely the next day and were discharged. Recalling June 30th of this year, the Cao Feng family of five at No. 12 Wenlanfang, Julai Da Road, similarly obtained something that looked and tasted like salt. They used it to make pancakes instead of salt, and the whole family was on the verge of death. After being sent to our hospital for emergency treatment, four people recovered the next day, but a four-year-old child died. After investigation, this salt-like substance is a chemical product and not real salt. Eating it causes poisoning. Our hospital, recognizing that they were all poor people, provided free treatment, which is not worth mentioning. However, we are afraid that ignorant poor people will accidentally eat it again and lose their lives, which would be very pitiful. Therefore, we request that you publish this in your column to advise poor people that if they obtain something that looks and tastes like salt but cannot confirm that it is salt, please do not eat it hastily. Spreading this information will be a great act of merit."</p>
<h3 id="e116">On Carefree Opium Withdrawal (II) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Qi</p>
<p>2.  Causes of Opium Addiction</p>
<p>The reasons why the human body can become accustomed to opium (meaning gradually consuming large amounts of opium without causing acute poisoning and death) are still debated by scholars from various countries, so this article will not go into detail. I will only describe the general reasons for opium addiction, which is that opium has effective pain-relieving, sedative, and anti-diarrheal effects. Therefore, patients often use it on their own to treat various painful or long-term illnesses, such as stomach pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, asthma, gonorrhea, hemoptysis, nocturnal emission, etc., but they do not know that it can only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. So, occasional use seems very effective, but once stopped, the disease recurs. Thus, repeated use leads to addiction over time. Moderate amounts of opium have a temporary stimulating and refreshing effect, which can suddenly increase physical strength and cause a feeling of pleasure. Therefore, many people who are overworked and physically exhausted mistakenly believe it to be an effective medicine. Furthermore, those who engage in debauchery and gambling often use it as a wonderful product for stimulation and refreshment, initially thinking it is just for entertainment to increase interest and eliminate烦恼 (fánnǎo) [troubles; worries], but they do not know that addiction will develop over time, and they will regret it too late! I once conducted a survey and found that most people use opium for stimulation and refreshment to obtain pleasure, followed by those who become addicted due to using it to treat illnesses. There are also very few who are commonly referred to as having "congenital addiction," meaning that during fetal development, their mother's opium habit was very deep, and they develop opium addiction at birth.</p>
<p>3.  Symptoms of Opium Withdrawal</p>
<p>When opium users do not receive a sufficient dose or suddenly stop, they experience various uncomfortable symptoms, which are medically termed withdrawal symptoms, commonly called "fayin." The symptoms that occur depend on the type of opium used, the dosage, the constitution of the user, and the reason for the addiction. Common withdrawal symptoms include yawning, sneezing, tearing, chills, sweating, cramps, fatigue, depression, insomnia, pain, belching, vomiting, diarrhea, nocturnal emission, etc. Although these symptoms are painfully unbearable, they can subside and gradually heal within four or five days for those who are physically strong and have not deeply addicted to opium. However, those who initially used opium to treat a persistent or serious illness often experience hemoptysis, diarrhea, asthma, tremors, collapse, and gradual impairment of heart function when they suddenly stop, and death may also occur.</p>
