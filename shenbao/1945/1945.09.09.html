<p>**Three Proclamations to Reassure the People**</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th – After arriving in the capital, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army He Yingqin issued three proclamations. The original text is as follows: (1) The War of Resistance has been victorious, the war has ended, and peace has been initially established. The people should recuperate. This Commander-in-Chief has been ordered to come to the capital to oversee military affairs. All citizens should remain in their respective occupations, strictly abide by order, and all police should be loyal to their duties, serve as usual, and maintain public order. In particular, they should earnestly protect the Allied nations. Those who are traitors, spread rumors to confuse the public, disrupt public order, or commit other illegal acts will be severely punished according to the law. (2) All laws, regulations, and procedures promulgated by the puppet government should be completely abolished. All those who were arrested for patriotic acts, or who violated puppet laws that do not violate national law and have been detained and sentenced to imprisonment, should be declared innocent and restored to freedom. In addition to awaiting the arrival of judicial organs in the capital for re-examination and approval, and releasing them to demonstrate the rule of law, this is specially announced for public knowledge. (3) The puppet government imposed excessive taxes and levies, which were burdensome and caused hardship for the people. This Commander-in-Chief has been ordered to come to the capital, deeply concerned. In accordance with Chairman Chiang's benevolent intentions and to alleviate the people's difficulties, it is ordered that all taxes in Nanjing Municipality be temporarily exempted to alleviate hardship. After the tax collection personnel arrive, the central tax regulations will be announced and implemented.</p>
<p>**Hosting Reporters and Giving a Talk**</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th – Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the Central Military Academy at 3:20 PM on the 8th. Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu, General McClure, and Chief of Staff Bodner were all present. Commander-in-Chief He gave a speech stating, "I remember that on November 26th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the day we left the capital, we all had a deep determination and strong confidence. We must fight to the end, achieve final victory, and return to the capital." Indeed, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, the united efforts of the military and civilians of the whole country, and the assistance of the Allied nations, after eight years of arduous War of Resistance, we finally achieved a glorious victory and returned to the capital. My heart is naturally filled with infinite excitement and joy. At the same time, thinking of the soldiers and compatriots who sacrificed for the War of Resistance in the past eight years, and the suffering experienced by the compatriots in the occupied areas for eight years, I cannot help but feel grateful. Today, returning to the capital, I must first represent Chairman Chiang in expressing sincere condolences to the compatriots in the occupied areas and the families of the soldiers and civilians who died. Our victory is not accidental, not by chance. Our future goal is only how to build our country into a truly prosperous, strong, healthy, and happy country, to jointly shoulder the task of laying the foundation for lasting world peace. This is the effort that all compatriots in the country should make in the future." A reporter asked about the time required to disarm the Japanese troops. Commander-in-Chief He replied that it would take approximately three months to complete.</p>

<p>The Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi Five Counties Sojourners in Shanghai Association has a history of more than 30 years, and its affairs have always been far-reaching.

Recently, it also established a scholarship to assist needy students from the five counties studying in Shanghai. These two projects are being actively carried out and are highly praised by people from all counties. Now, it has established the "Five Counties Special Scholarship" and entrusted this newspaper to select five high school students and the News Newspaper to select five high school students. They are enthusiastically helping students, and the colleagues of this newspaper express their deep admiration. The original letter said: "Dear Sirs, when our association selected outstanding students this time, we specially reserved ten places. We respectfully entrust your newspaper to select five outstanding college students (one from each of Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi, limited to science and engineering majors) and the News Newspaper to select five outstanding high school students. As soon as they are selected and sent to the association, we will immediately provide each college student with 600,000 yuan and each high school student with 400,000 yuan. We have long known that your newspaper is dedicated to helping students in the county and has achieved remarkable results and has a special enthusiasm for benefiting the poor. We are sure that you will be happy to accept this."</p>
