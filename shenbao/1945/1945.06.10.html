<h3>具有空前重大意義　日召集臨時議會　貴族院昨通過語奉答文</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電日政府鑒於戰局之重大化，必須對將臨本土之決戰採取非常措置，經奏請大皇裁奪後，具有空前東大意義之第八十七屆臨時議會於入日舉行，並決定九。十兩日繼續開會。於此次議會中，日政府所提出之法律案，協戰時緊急措置法案與國民義勇兵役法，以及其他重要法案等，其中戰時緊急措置法案之內容，爲根據非常措置，增强軍書生產，食糧增產，戰災對策，運輸及通信之强化等當前緊急施策，政府得隨時使其職權。議會對政府則具有全權委任之性質，政府提掛此法案，爲與最近各方所建議之「憲法第三十一條非常大權」有同樣效果之立法措置，希望議會一致贊成。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電日貴族院八日開第八十七臨時議會，上午十時零七分舉行成立會議，一切議式終了後，至下午一時三二十分，眾議院開會，推舉易田。勝山二氏爲正副候補議長，靜待會議繼績，至傍晚兩院共同成立，九日舉行開會式。</p>
<h3>開院式語</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電日火皇陛下，常第八十七次臨時會議開院式之際。乘賜　語如左：</p>
<p>朕於茲舉行帝國議會開院式，告爾貴族院及眾議院各員，朕之忠勇陸。海將兵，協心一力，警摧勁敵，朕之忠良一億臣民，冒戰　耐動火，善能勵精後方之責任，而與友邦之聯盟，愈加　固，朕深欣慰。最者，世界大局急變，敵之侵略亦倍極猖獗，實乃粉碎敵國非望，達成征戰目的，以發揮團體精華之秋也。朕信倚爾有眾之忠誠勇武，共分艱苦，庶幾恢復光大祖遺業。朕命國務大臣特將關於時局之緊急議案，提出於帝國議會。卿等克體朕意，和衷審議，竭其協贊之任。</p>
<h3>日首相在議會演說</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　鈴木首相本日於貴族院及眾議院本會議之施政方針演說，內容如下：</p>
<p>本日議會舉行開院式，拜受優渥之　語，不勝惶恐感激，余願與諸位共奉聖旨，以安宸襟。前者，敵機空裝，宮城及大宮御所發生火災，爲臣者誠不勝惶恐，幸而三陛下及實所得慶平安，天皇陛下仍於宮城內處理萬機，誠屬萬幸。今日日本帝國遭遇建國以來前所未有之萬大危局，我人雖舉馴努力，戰局仍逐次緊張，爲我本土一角之冲繩島，業已被敵人侵寇，冲縄之戰，我陸海軍一致勇戰，官民協力敢關，迭創頑敵，此種忠誠義烈，自將永乘青史，余贊表甚深之敬意。然今日冲繩之戰况，頗有足深憂慮者，勢之所趨，本土其他地點，不久亦恐有敵人之侵寇，當此之時，一萬萬同胞，允宜同心勝力，對付此嚴重之局勢。夫大東亞戰爭，已如宣戰詔書中所明示，我國因美。英兩國之橫暴態態度及非分野望，國家生存，愛其威脅。帝國爲自存自立計，爲安定東亞之責任及努力成果之維持計，不得已而採此舉階，世界之上，酷愛和平，希求人類福祉，當以天皇陛下爲最。使萬邦各歸其所，四海同胞瞭解人類之道義，推進文化，則又爲握皇室建國以來之本願，然因英。美之非道，致使上項國策無法進行。申言之，帝國之戰，實基於人類正義之大通，惟有貫澈始終，邁進完成，交戰各國，雖巧言令色，粉飾理由，夷考實際，不外出於人類弱點————卑鄙感情之妬嫉，聞敵人今要求我人無條件投降，照此爲破壞我國體，減亡我民族，我人對之，惟有作戰到底，以保全帝國之白存自衛。今中華民國，滿洲以及大東亞諸國，與我國締結盟約，貢獻於戰爭，誠使帝國感謝不置。本屆戰爭，乃反抗英。美奴化東亞之解放戰，戰爭而敗，東亞民族將永遠喪失自山，世界正義，亦將完全受　　。帝國期類與締盟諸邦，一致到底，帝國關於大東亞及世界秩序之根本方針，係於政治的平等，經濟的互惠，固有文化之尊重等原則下，確保各國民族之典斗其榮，確定不威脅，不侵略之安全保障之途。由此見地，帝國對於中華民國之統一救國氣運，實表支持，更願促進與中立國之繁榮，　若本土化為戰場，則地利人和，我均勝利敵萬倍。換言之，屆時我人可集合火軍於必需之地點，軍事接濟，亦感容易，與以前之戰門，將大不相同，斯時確信必能擊敗敵入，潰減其職意。際茲嚴重之戰局現階段，我國內情形，以食糧而諭，今後國不能謂爲充分，交通方面，亦有缺乏園滑之虞，至於軍需生產，其困難亦與日俱增，然全體國民倘能奮發作戰，以決死之努力，守各人之職位，余確信必能克服困難，完成戰爭之目的也。靜察敵國國內情勢之動向，幾乎國際情勢之歸趨，莫不使人痛感我人惟有作戰到底，捨此之外，無他途可循。余蓋基此信念，而有命組閣者，雖指工作艱巨，深顧國民諸君協力，以盡奉公致　，余此次奏請召開議會，提出各種法案，尚祈諸君迅加審議焉。</p>
<p>陸海兩相報告戰況東京九日中央社電九日貴族院本會議，於上午十時三十分開會，首由德川議長報告，對於日前空襲宮中蒙受損害，應行奉慰，旋即議決敕語奉答文，後由酒井副議長提議，對日前空製所受損害，議決以院議德川長以下慴宮奉慮。又由德用議特提議，爲對處緊急事態，決定假正副義長，亦即通過，遂開始入於討論狀態，全院委員長指名由島忠重公（火　會會員）担任。十時五十分鈴本首相登增發表施政演說，歷二十分鐘，次由阿南陸相，米內海相作戰况報告，德川議長提出對陸。海華及前綫將兵發送感謝敬弔之決議文，當即一致通過，陸。海兩相相繼發表謝辭，後追加日程，一。裁判所構成法，戰時特令中改正法律案（政府提出），由松阪法相說明提案理由，遂各附讬特別委員審議，至十一時〇五分散會</p>
<p>政府提出六項法案東京九日中央社電　日政府八日定例閣議，決議通過以下列法律案向臨時議會提出，　戰時緊急措置法案。　關於眾議院議員選舉法第十條之特別法律案。　議勇兵役法案。　關於國民義勇職鬥隊員之陸軍刑法，海軍刑法，陸軍軍法會議法，海軍軍法會議法之法律案。　裁判所構成法，戰時特別修正之法律案。　戰時民事特別法及戰時刑事特別法中所修正之法律案</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　自鈴木內閣成立以來，已經二月，其間對外有歐洲情勢之急變，對內則冲　戰局絡見聚迫，誠爲有史以來之難關。今日本朝野　認，當此時代必需集國民總力，實行「特攻政治」，日政府自本月以來，即開始與衆議各派一再舉行重要懇談。關於戰爭施策之根本問題，意見已趨一致，眾議院各派對　以增强戰力之活躍爲日標，修正或廢止旣存法令，　組織合法的義勇軍等二項具體問題，激勵政府，大日木政治會，護國議員同志會，亦於八日分別舉行幹部會議，決議希望强化政治。</p>
<h3>蘇州推進　平價施策</h3>
<p>蘇州九日中央社電　蘇省府以各項民生必需物品價格頻漲，爲釜底抽薪予以平抑起見，特由任省長曁孫建廳長之竭力設法，商洽粉總會配給麵粉一萬五千包，即日開始第一期配給，於平民生活補益良多，至第二期，第三期戶口配給，亦在積極規期中，當使其源源不輟。按任省長向以增加生產，安定民生爲治事之本，爲蘇省父老減少職爭痛一苦，此次麵粉配給僅爲全盤計劃之初步實施，如何長治久安之策，亦均確立有案，蘇省人民莫不稱快。</p>
<h3>冲繩本島陸戰　呈混亂狀態　日軍已完成邀擊態勢</h3>
<p>蘇球羣道基地九日中央社電　冲繩本島之陸戰鬥，漸成混亂狀態，兩軍在大雨泥灣中激戰終日，戰門中心逐向南方　移，日軍主力據守南方主要陣地，完成邀擊態勢，決意粉碎敵軍攻勢。敵軍現已漸次侵人日主要陣地，四日傍晚在內問與座岳氣象台，系滿街通以西一帶展開激戰。又再東海岸方面，五百農敵軍二百之眾，進犯備志頭，該處日　部　奪戰後。至下午六時　將其擊退。在那期西南方，敵軍向小綠飛機場進擊，日軍部隊在陣地前面誘敵，展開白刃戰，予以擊退。又小祿與西寄中間，日軍邀擎以迫擊砲攻擊之敵軍，該處日守備部隊勇敢殺入。使敵大量流血。又自眞玉橋方面南下之敵軍，從側面援助攻擊小祿飛機場，在　波與根差部一帶遭遇日軍猛烈反擊，敵軍於四日勝晚從仲縄本島南部四周艦艇上猛烈砲擊，援助陸上戰鬥。</p>
<p>前綫航空基地九日中央社電八日拂曉，日振武特攻隊攻繫冲縄週圍敵艦船，對戰艦一艘，大型輸送船一艘，艦型不明者六艘突人拼衝，八日夜至九日晨，特攻攻繫依然熾烈續行中。</p>
<h3>蘇發售金卷　成績良好</h3>
<p>蘇州九日中央社電　中儲銀行蘇州支行，奉總行令自本月五日開始發售第一期進證劵，計分一兩，五兩良種，每兩褂牌價格一百二十五萬元，發行期間分兩日，兩日出售結果　成績良好，計共售出一百六十七兩，收回法帶兩萬萬另八百七十五萬元。滬行已公布滬行第一期進證劵屆期兌換金條，是以人心愈益穩固，金條黑市已急劇下降，預　今後進證劵對於吸收游資，穩定　幣之力，將更見增強。</p>

<h3>錫澄慮萬民盲從　先天道內幕（一）</h3>
<p>— 余彧</p>
<p>先天道產生的由來</p>
<p>先大道的產生，已經有很　久的歷史了，但在江南一帶，去年歲底才歲，久居無錫山門口恒善堂，係同善扣於錫縣府保安隊內，年三十餘歲，事變前曾服務某報館發行科，後爲該鄉富戶朱枚潔管理賬務。據倪供述：他發起先天道，是受了刺激所致，他會備遊匪周動親部隊綁架，受了打擊後，　思復仇，他原爲同善社會員，已入會十一年，所以與徐粹初相識，他把受刺激的經過以及意圖復仇之念，告訴於徐，面徐也深受匪類削剝之苦，頗表同情。當時聞北京及山東一帶，有先天道勢力甚大，入道爲徒後，能刀槍不入。於是，決意前去求道，於去年十一月，相偕携帶五人，前往山東濟南，得先天道運絡員張智先之介紹，與該會會長江洪濤認識，徐倪說明來意，力請江洪濤協助，當時江就派教師邊實倉，助理梁鑑卿，隨徐倪返錫安鎖鄉問，開始傳道。</p>
<p>設擅講道與複習</p>
<p>初時是嚴守秘密的，稱爲「先大道佛力保家會」，意思是借助佛力，保護家鄉。發動時會員很少，僅數十人，後來增至二百多人。傳道的方法分一種：一種是設壞講道，一種是傳習武藝，當傳授武藝時，教師先用刀在手腕上砍三刀，證明是刀槍不入之意，實際上刀口極鈍，用力又很輕，鄉民不察，見有微效，化以爲眞。於是一傳十，十傳百地，普遍傳播，不久加入的道徒，驟增到二千之數。</p>
<p>他們所使用的武器，是大刀長搶，頭上擊一塊黑布，黑色密門紐短衫。施武時，先在搜前參拜一番，口中唸唸有辭，咒語是「南斗共北斗，眾人筆下走，神兵走下去，斬斷烏龍頭」。唸畢之後，兩眼圓睜，舞動武器，高呼「殺！殺！殺！」如瘋如狂，往前衛去。</p>
<p>道規與紀神</p>
<p>據該地鄉人說，先天道也有規則，入會之後，必須摒除一切惡念，「不准奸淫盜邪，不准欺世減祖，不准傳道於匪人，不准貧非義之財」，否則其法無效。因此個個人循規蹈矩。造成了一種「路不拾遺，夜不閉戶」的現象。入會的方式，是先經會員二人介紹，男女不拘，拜傳道師爲師，一面默詳神靈，一面用黃紙朱筆畫一符，神前燒化，再將紙灰命受禮者用永服下，謂從此可以永有神靈暗中保護，刀搶不入。</p>
<p>先天道祀儀很簡單，設一壞，台上供香燭，不設菓品，也不燒錫箔。據該會北州京方面代表張智先謂，供奉「伏義氏」爲先天老社，「文王」爲後天老社，，其他老聃等，亦是要神之一。因爲伏羲創八卦，開創了天地，指示了先天之機；文王定易經，設禮儀，發明了後天之道，後生之路；至於老聃，因他過涵谷關與關　了一部「道德經」，於是「玄之又玄」，給先天道當爲「眾妙之們」。但無錫一帶却不同，所奉的神，是「先天老爺」，「天地老爺」，沒有姓名，沒有考證，只有一個可以老查的，便是「關聖帝君」，這也許是南派北派之別呢！（未完）</p>
<h3>英敘舉行會談</h3>
<p>百倫九日中央社電　據貝魯特電台廣播：叙利亞外長貝伊，與駐叙英軍總　令貝格特等，於今晨在大馬色舉行會談。</p>
<h3>柏林漸復常態</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據莫斯科電台廣播稱，柏林城正在積極恢復中，一部份大街已燈　　煌，其他如鳥托頓林登大街燈，亦將於最近數日內建立路燈。於過去數周來，四條地下甬道，十三條電車路線，四條公共汽車路線，均已貫通，數十輛電車汽車在道中飛馳。柏林城內二十餘處著名之市區中，已有十一區恢復供給電力，二萬五千棟柏林民房中，亦已有各項電力之設置。關於電話用戶，目前已有一萬三千家，大部份銀行均複業。</p>

<h3>實際問題與政治力量</h3>
<p>— 朱右松</p>
<p>政治力量的强弱，在戰時足以決定作戰的勝負，在平時足以決定建設的成敗。蓋無論爲作戰或建設，均須動員民眾，取得其真誠的協力，方克有濟。然則如何增强政治力最呢？首光自須堅定民眾的信心，方能對於民力，作有計劃的配置。而欲達成此目的，除理論的宣傳以外，更須重視實際的問起。——尤其富此戰亂已久，一般人都焦慮於現實生活之際，常局者對於實際問題能否作賢明切賞的解決，尤足以決定民心之向背。</p>
<p>今日中國是參戰國家，理當遝用强大的政治力量，以確保後方，貢獻物資。但此種工作，在在與實際問題密切相關。茲將目前實際問題之尤要者，伸論如后：</p>
<p>第一個實際問題是治安。要確保後方，自須維持治安。不幸近年來和平區內，治安非特未見改善，抑且匪盜出沒，農村不寗，最近在錫。武。澄。處四縣，並有先天道，金光道等邪教，　惑農民，實行仇殺。再者大都市中，亦因物價高漲，以致民生疾苦，羣情惶恐，長此下去，治安堪盧。考社會秩序之混亂達於此極的原因，在鄉開是由於土劣的敵詐，不良軍警之欺凌，馴至民心怨忿，而予匪盜以可乘之機；在都市是由於暴利之徒囤積投機，以致刺戰物價狂升疾漲。故救治之道，先須澄淸吏治，籠辦奸商，然後開導民衆，征剿匪邪。此積工作，應先自點做起，漸次及於面，並當質澈「戰時用月種刑」之旨，將大魚小魚，一網打盡。只要負責認真嚴肅辦理，則後力治安，必可戰定。</p>
<p>第二個實際問題是生產。戰時物資的消耗倍增於平時，而遠地物資又無法運到，倘若不事增產，必致供不應求。此其影響，非特社會貧困而已，抑且引致民心不滿，而削弱政治力量。但徒唱「增產」口號，決無裨益；必須埋頭實踐，方能收效。例如農貸工作，便是增加農產之一法。他如配給工廠以充份之常力，謀使原料的供應與機件的搬運以最大之便利，以及　培專門的產業技術人員鄧，都是希望當局與民間共同商討和實行的。</p>
<p>第三個實際問題是民食。這是一切問題中的先決問題。蓋須民食有着，生活安定，民衆方能盡其本分的責任，再加以正確的訓練，不餓進而爲國策獻身。若夫民食不繼，民不聊生，老弱者轉於溝壑，少壯者挺而走險，則政府將失其基礎，其對於政治力量的影嚮，不言可　。今日米價狂漲，物價隨騰，民食民生，感受極大威脅。這一根本的實際問題如不解決，則將形成衆重的社會危機。是故對此迫切的民食問題，應請中日關係當局竭盡可能，迅速解決。在消極方面，希望明令禁止徵糧員之焚燬稻堆，嚴懲米糧商之國積投機，使已感不足之民食不再作人爲的減少，並使高漲的糧價相當地抑平。在積極方面，則希望一方面迅速疏通來源，一方面向現地盟邦當局磋商借糧，在最折期內，實施配給或平賣，藉以　止民間食糧恐慌的心理，而免引起不良的後果。至於最主要的對策，自是增加食糧的產量；其具體辦法，本報前已屢次諭列，在此毋庸贊言，只須實行即可！</p>
<p>「爲政不在多言」，「事實是最好的宣傳」，政治力量的產生，實基於實際問題之解決。前述三點，不過是最根本的問題，倘若對此而不能解決，則安能得民心，安能言政治力量，安能求戰爭勝利？這決不是危言聳聽，尚望　局者考慮及之！</p>

<h3>昨十八次防空日　實施嚴格訓練　中日國民防空思想融洽交流</h3>
<p>昨（九）日爲第十八次防空日，本市防空當局，循例據大宣傳防空意義及實施防空訓練，全日入於防空狀態中，情緒極度緊張，茲將詳情分記如次：</p>
<p>警報訓練</p>
<p>警報訓練並不吹鳴警報，實施警報傳達訓練，於上午八時訓練警戒警報發令。各區以銅　標示旗及電話等傳達，各分局派員檢點防空壕，防空井等各保甲及家庭防空設施。並召集防空人員訓話以及作各項防空措置之準備。至下午四時訓陳空襲警報發令，仍以銅　際示旗電話等傳達外，全市實施之交通管制，出動全體保甲人員協助警察指揮交通，步行人紛靠左街沿佇立十分鐘後，方得　左行走，一切車輛除懸有非常標記者外，一律不准行駛。停靠左街沿，極度嚴格執行，各娛樂塲所停止音樂，舞蹈，戲劇等娛樂。同時實施待避訓練，警保人員指導民衃趨避防空壕，各商店銀行等行號，以及各種娛樂塲所等，均實施待避訓練。觀眾等由各該塲所之特別自警團，防空團，指導趨避防空壕或適當之塲所。各區分別指定適常地址，實施監視，待避，消火，救護等各項防空綜合訓練。至五時空襲警報解除。</p>
<p>燈火管制</p>
<p>日沒後實施警戒燦火管制，至九時正訓練空襲警報再度發令，當實施燈火管制，及交通管制亦嚴格執行，無論任何車輛，除非常本輛外，不得通行，軍警及保甲人員分別組織燈火取締班，至各該管轄區內巡查，無論公司行號以及戲院，咖啡館，舞廳，旅館等娛樂塲所，均絕對不得洩漏燈光，及停止娛樂，如有違章情事，當山取締班抄錄門牌或店號，即予以斷電處分，並採取述坐制，即附近一甲一保嚴重奢甚至聯保，均予斷電處分。同時各區實施夜間綜合訓緬，尤其對待避訓練共爲注重，在「黑市狀態」中，警保人員指導民衃向防空壕及適當地點趨避。至十時正，訓練空襲警報解除。實施警戒燈火管制，防空殘置燈恢復燈光，至十時半，訓練警戒警報全部解除，恢復常態。</p>

<h3>警局破獲　毒品製造廠　假敵產房屋大規模製造</h3>
<p>市警察局第三處烟毒查緝科，於本月初，偵悉滬西大西路底，鐵路以西，有人假敵產房屋，大規模製造毒品，當將詳情呈報第三處處長李時雨，派該科科長吳錫泉積極着手進行偵查，經過一星期詳密調查，於六月七日上午九時半，由烟毒查緝科科長吳錫泉，副科長伊東文雄，率領主任科員金宏康龐豪，帶同全體科員，並會同憲兵隊，乘車前往滬西伊犁路六號，將該製造毒品機關破獲。首先拘獲製毒技師沈菊生等六名，在屋內抄獲已製成之海洛因約一百兩，以及原料半製成品製造用具，化學藥水等物共　，總値約在一萬萬五千萬元以上，經帶局詳加諮詢，偵悉該毒品機關主持人名葉鵬（又名葉公複），現任北京路大森錢莊董事長，遂派金主任科員帶同便衣警士丁兆淦，朱息惠等，馳往大森錢莊將葉鵬拘獲，供稱早年曾留學日本，在早稻田大學供讀政治經濟，平素喜歡研究化學，自民國三十年多起即開始製造毒品，逐漸發展，以迄於今，所租賃之敵查房屋，係自一日人處租來。本案現正鎭密調查中，此次毒品機關之破案，頗能肅淸毒氛</p>

<p>關於本市航運業之管理，以往因事權未經劃定，致使經管該業者，有無所適從之情事。茲悉有關當局，已縝密研討，確定凡屬航運蘇浙皖三省各地流域之船舶，一律應由中央航政機關管轄，至在本市區範圍以內之航業，則歸市建設局管理。</p>
<h3>桑原部長闡述　太平洋戰局　就任後首次會見記者團</h3>
<p>新任駐華艦隊報道部長桑原大佐，昨日下午二時在海軍武官府接見本市中外新聞記者，作就任後之首次會談，即席閘述太平洋戰局，及今後敵美大陸作戰之趨勢等，茲誌大要如次</p>
<p>自松島大佐轉任後，報道部長一職，暫由本人兼代，惟本人對此任務殊鮮經騐，尚望在座諸君，多多指教是幸。今日即以太平洋最近戰局，與諸君一述，藉作首次見面之談話。</p>
<p>沖繩兩車慘烈激戰</p>
<p>太平洋戰局以冲繩島爲中心，日美兩軍仍慘烈激戰中。此種劇戰，實爲日美未來決戰之前夜。日軍利用最上之戰術，使敵出血，諸君當已知之有素。日軍之作戰方法乃如何使敵人多受殲減，其攻擊之目標，則爲冲繩周邊之敵縊船，擊沉擊破者，其數目已在五百六十艘之上，敵方已無法隱蔽而發表矣。美海軍部長福來施脫曾要求多加訓練修理艦船之熟手工人，尼米茲亦承認其艦船及人力損害之重大，故其今後作戰必發生重大障碍無疑。</p>
<p>美軍死亡數目大增</p>
<p>美海軍人員死亡數目傚增，陸上亦同，大爲增加，例如昨日（八日）美軍發表之損害，比較上週海軍方面增加三千三百四十七人，總計爲十一萬六千二百十五人，陸上比上週增加九千一百六十二人，總計八十九萬五千八百三十四人，由此可知敵人在一週間之出血數量爲如何矣。日軍在此種作戰目的之下，繼續邁進，自信今後敵方損害必非常擴大，而使其喪失戰意。作戰最重要之關頭，爲最後之五分鐘。我人無論如何必澈底作戰，至獲得最後勝利而穢已。</p>
<p>應付敵軍有備無患</p>
<p>桑原大佐並即席答復新聞記者所提出之兩問題如下：　（問）冲繩決戰日烈，如戰事有新的轉移，對中國之影響如何？（答）冲繩方面，刻正傚戰中，我人決不輕易使敵人任意壓制，假定該地爲敵人所獲得，則所堪注意者，當爲敵空軍對華之活動爲如何，此時敵空軍基地更形接近中國大陸，其空軍兵力，對中國沿岸自有活潑可能，對上海靑島南京等地，可能實行大規模積極之活動，但究竟實情如何，除電詢尼米茲外，殆亦無法揣測耳，總之，我方有備無患，已有相當準備？</p>
<p>登陸作戰必予打擊</p>
<p>（問）大陸作戰之趨勢如何？（答）此問題之結論，爲美國無論物資如何豐富，如欲速戰，因難孔多，假定敵人登陸作戰，第一常爲兵力問題，過去對冲繩琉黃等偏僻小島，已需用相當之兵力，如冲繩作戰，美國一個兵士須附帶有一·六噸之軍火　重等，如動用十萬兵，一日間即需要十六噸之物資·冲繩之戰，敵人旣已遭受嚴重打擊，將來對於人員遝輸等方面，其困難情形，自甚明顯，其次敵人愈接近日方之重要根據地，所遭受之反抗亦愈甚，故敵人縱有登陸作戰之意，日軍必當予以嚴重打擊也。</p>
<p>桑原大佐略歷</p>
<p>中國方面艦隊報道部長桑原重遠大佐略歷：原　熊本縣，大正七年畢業海軍兵學校，服務海上，後任大本營海軍參謀兼海軍報道部員，昭和十四年，任興亞院調查官，來華往返於京滬間，翌年十一月，晉級海軍大佐，昭和十六年任軍令部踝長，十九年七月轉任上海在勤海軍武官輔佐官兼中國方面艦隊參謀，並任情報課長之職，今更兼任報道部長。</p>
<h3>給水電氣　調整收費率</h3>
<p>本市建設局，以關於給水常氣兩項收費率及罰則，久未更改，目前已不適用，亟應調整，業將各項收費一律照前增加十倍，罰則增加一百倍，並已呈奉市府核准，即日施行</p>
<h3>戶口粉配給證　嚴禁買賣</h3>
<p>本市戶口配給麵粉，自於本月七日開始配給，近發現有少數市民竟以麵粉配給票擅作買賣，殊失當局配給之意義。茲悉有關當局，對於該項情事，正嚴密查究，以維配政。</p>

<p>市衛生當局，夏季衛生運動大會，籌備委員會六日舉行第一次會議，決議大會於本月二十五日開幕。</p>

<h3>Of Unprecedented Significance: Japan Convenes Extraordinary Diet, House of Peers Passes Rescript Reply</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In light of the increasing gravity of the war situation, necessitating extraordinary measures for the impending homeland决战, the Japanese government, after seeking imperial sanction, convened the 87th Extraordinary Diet on the designated day, which possesses unprecedented significance. It was also decided to continue the sessions on the 9th and 10th. Among the legislative bills submitted by the Japanese government in this Diet are the Wartime Emergency Measures Act, the National Volunteer Corps Act, and other important bills. The Wartime Emergency Measures Act, in particular, aims to empower the government to exercise its authority at any time based on extraordinary measures, strengthening military production, increasing food production, implementing war disaster countermeasures, and reinforcing transportation and communication—urgent measures currently needed. The Diet is to grant the government full authority. The introduction of this bill is a legislative measure with the same effect as the “extraordinary powers under Article 31 of the Constitution” recently advocated by various parties, and the government hopes the Diet will unanimously approve it.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese House of Peers convened the 87th Extraordinary Diet on the 8th. The inaugural session was held at 10:07 AM. After all the formalities were completed, the House of Representatives convened at 1:32 PM, nominating Mr. Yoda and Mr. Katsuyama as candidates for Speaker and Deputy Speaker, respectively, awaiting the continuation of the session. In the evening, both houses jointly convened, and the opening ceremony will be held on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Imperial Address at the Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – His Imperial Majesty the Emperor, on the occasion of the opening ceremony of the 87th Extraordinary Session of the Imperial Diet, bestowed the following address:</p>
<p>"We hereby hold the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet and inform you, members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, that our loyal and brave army and navy officers and men, united in heart and strength, are diligently thwarting powerful enemies. Our loyal one hundred million subjects are braving war and enduring hardships, diligently fulfilling their responsibilities in the rear, and the alliance with our friendly nations is becoming ever stronger, which We find deeply gratifying. Recently, the global situation has changed rapidly, and the enemy's aggression has become exceedingly rampant. Now is the time to crush the enemy's extravagant ambitions and achieve the goals of our war, thereby demonstrating the essence of our unity. We trust in the loyalty and bravery of you all to share our hardships, hoping to restore and glorify the heritage of our ancestors. We have instructed the Minister of State to submit to the Imperial Diet urgent bills concerning the current situation. We urge you to embody Our will, deliberate harmoniously, and diligently fulfill your duty to cooperate."</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister's Speech at the Diet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a policy address today at the plenary sessions of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, at the opening ceremony of the Diet, We received an Imperial Address, for which We are overwhelmed with reverence and gratitude. I wish to join with all of you in abiding by the Imperial will to reassure His Majesty. Previously, enemy aircraft attacked, and fires occurred at the Imperial Palace and the Omiya Imperial Residence, for which We, as subjects, are deeply apprehensive. Fortunately, Their Majesties and the Imperial Family are all safe and sound, and His Majesty the Emperor continues to attend to affairs of state within the Imperial Palace, which is indeed a great blessing. Today, the Japanese Empire is facing an unprecedented crisis since its founding. Although we have made every effort, the war situation is gradually intensifying. Okinawa Island, a corner of our homeland, has already been invaded by the enemy. In the Battle of Okinawa, our army and navy fought bravely as one, and the officials and people cooperated and dared to resist, repeatedly inflicting damage on the stubborn enemy. This loyalty and righteousness will surely be recorded in history for all time, and I express my deepest respect. However, the current situation in Okinawa is deeply concerning. As things stand, other parts of the homeland may soon be invaded by the enemy as well. At this time, all one hundred million compatriots should unite in heart and strength to deal with this grave situation. The Greater East Asia War, as clearly stated in the declaration of war, was undertaken by our country due to the tyrannical attitude and unreasonable ambitions of the United States and Great Britain, which threatened the survival of our nation. The Empire was compelled to take this step for the sake of its own survival and independence, and for the sake of maintaining its responsibility for the stability of East Asia and the fruits of its efforts. In the world, none loves peace and desires the welfare of humanity more than His Majesty the Emperor. Allowing all nations to return to their rightful places, and enabling all peoples to understand the principles of humanity and advance culture, has been the fundamental aspiration of the Imperial Family since the founding of the nation. However, due to the injustice of Great Britain and the United States, the aforementioned national policies could not be carried out. In other words, the Empire's war is based on the great justice of humanity and must be pursued to the end. Although the warring nations may use clever words and embellish their reasons, upon close examination, they are nothing more than the product of human weaknesses – the base emotions of jealousy. We hear that the enemy is now demanding our unconditional surrender. To do so would be to destroy our national polity and eradicate our people. We have no choice but to fight to the end to preserve the Empire's self-preservation and self-defense. Today, the Republic of China, Manchuria, and the nations of Greater East Asia have concluded alliances with our country and are contributing to the war, for which the Empire is deeply grateful. This war is a war of liberation against the enslavement of East Asia by Great Britain and the United States. If the war is lost, the peoples of East Asia will forever lose their freedom, and world justice will be completely 受　　. The Empire pledges to stand united with its allied nations to the end. The Empire's fundamental policies regarding the Greater East Asia and world order are to ensure the dignity and prosperity of all nations under the principles of political equality, economic mutual benefit, and respect for indigenous cultures, and to establish a path to security that does not threaten or invade. From this perspective, the Empire supports the unification and national salvation aspirations of the Republic of China, and further desires to promote prosperity with neutral nations.　If the homeland becomes a battlefield, we will be a million times more victorious due to the advantages of terrain and the unity of the people. In other words, at that time, we will be able to concentrate our fire forces at necessary locations, and military supply will also be easier. This will be very different from previous battles. At that time, we are confident that we will defeat the enemy and crush their intentions. At this critical stage of the war, the situation within our country, in terms of food, cannot be said to be sufficient in the future. There are also concerns about a lack of smooth transportation. As for military production, its difficulties are also increasing daily. However, if the entire nation can fight bravely and exert every effort to defend their respective positions, I am confident that we will overcome the difficulties and achieve the goals of the war. Observing the trends in enemy nations and the direction of the international situation, we are all painfully aware that we have no choice but to fight to the end. There is no other path to follow. It is on this conviction that I have been instructed to form a cabinet. Although the work is arduous, I deeply appreciate the cooperation of the people in dedicating themselves to serving the public. I have requested the convocation of this Diet and submitted various bills, and I pray that you will promptly deliberate on them."</p>

<h3>Xicheng Worries About the People Following Blindly; The Inside Story of Xiantiandao (1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>The Origin of Xiantiandao</p>
<p>The emergence of Xiantiandao (Way of Former Heaven) has a long history, but it only emerged in the Jiangnan area last year at the end of the year. Ni, who has been living in Hengshantang at Shanmenkou, Wuxi for a long time, is affiliated with the Tongshan Company within the Xixian County Security Team. He is over thirty years old. Before the incident, he worked in the circulation department of a newspaper and later managed accounts for the wealthy Zhu Meijie in the township. According to Ni's confession, he initiated Xiantiandao due to a stimulus. He was kidnapped by the bandit Zhou Dongqin's troops and, after being attacked, he thought of revenge. He was originally a member of the Tongshan Society, having been a member for eleven years, which is how he knew Xu Cuichu. He told Xu about his experience and his intention to seek revenge, and Xu also deeply suffered from the exploitation of bandits, expressing sympathy. At that time, they heard that the Xiantiandao had great influence in Beijing and Shandong, and that after joining the sect, one could become invulnerable to swords and spears. Therefore, they decided to seek the Tao and, in November of last year, they traveled with five others to Jinan, Shandong. Through the introduction of Zhang Zhixian, a Xiantiandao liaison, they met Jiang Hongtao, the leader of the sect. Xu and Ni explained their intentions and strongly requested Jiang Hongtao's assistance. At that time, Jiang sent teacher Bian Shicang and assistant Liang Jianqing to return to Ansuo Township, Xixian with Xu and Ni to begin preaching.</p>
<p>Setting up Lectures and Reviewing Skills</p>
<p>Initially, they were strictly secretive, calling it the "Xiantiandao Buddha Power Protection Association," meaning to use Buddha power to protect their hometown. When it was launched, there were very few members, only a few dozen, later increasing to more than two hundred. The methods of preaching were divided into two types: one was setting up lectures, and the other was teaching martial arts. When teaching martial arts, the teacher first used a knife to cut three times on his wrist to prove that he was invulnerable to swords and spears. In reality, the knife was very blunt, and the force used was very light. The villagers did not notice and, seeing a slight effect, believed it to be true. Thus, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred, spreading widely. Soon, the number of Dao followers joining the sect increased sharply to two thousand.</p>
<p>The weapons they used were broadswords and long spears. They wore a black cloth on their heads and a short black shirt with dense buttons. When performing martial arts, they first paid respects in front of the hall, chanting incantations. The spell was "Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, everyone walks under the pen, divine soldiers go down, sever the black dragon's head." After chanting, they widened their eyes, brandished their weapons, and shouted "Kill! Kill! Kill!" like madmen, advancing forward.</p>
<p>Rules and Sacrifices</p>
<p>According to the locals, Xiantiandao also had rules. After joining the sect, one must eliminate all evil thoughts, "do not engage in adultery, theft, or evil, do not deceive the world and reduce ancestors, do not pass on the Tao to bandits, do not covet ill-gotten wealth," otherwise the magic would be ineffective. Therefore, everyone followed the rules and regulations, creating a phenomenon of "not picking up lost items on the road, and not closing doors at night." The method of joining the sect was to be introduced by two members, regardless of gender, and to worship the preacher as their teacher. While silently reciting the names of the deities, they used yellow paper and vermillion ink to draw a talisman, which was burned in front of the deity. The ashes were then ordered to be swallowed by the recipient of the ceremony, claiming that from then on, they would be permanently protected by the deities in secret, and would be invulnerable to swords and spears.</p>
<p>The Xiantiandao sacrifices were very simple. A hall was set up, with incense and candles on the platform, but no fruit or tin foil was offered. According to Zhang Zhixian, the representative of the Beizhou Jing side of the sect, "Fuxi" was enshrined as the ancestral society of the former heaven, and "King Wen" was the ancestral society of the latter heaven. Other deities such as Lao Tzu were also important deities. Because Fuxi created the Eight Trigrams, creating heaven and earth and indicating the mechanism of the former heaven; King Wen established the Book of Changes, established rituals, and invented the way of the latter heaven and the path of later life; as for Lao Tzu, because he passed the Hangu Pass and wrote a "Tao Te Ching" with Guan Yin, it was "mysterious and mysterious," making it "the gate of all mysteries" for the Xiantiandao. However, it was different in the Wuxi area. The deities worshipped were "Former Heaven Grandpa" and "Heaven and Earth Grandpa," without names or evidence. The only one that could be investigated was "Lord Guan Yu," which may be the difference between the southern and northern factions! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Practical Problems and Political Power</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yousong</p>
<p>The strength or weakness of political power is sufficient to determine the outcome of a battle in wartime and the success or failure of construction in peacetime. Whether for war or construction, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and obtain their sincere cooperation to achieve success. So how can political power be strengthened? First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the people's confidence in order to make a planned allocation of popular power. To achieve this goal, in addition to theoretical propaganda, it is also necessary to attach importance to practical issues—especially since this war has been going on for a long time, and people are generally anxious about their real lives. Whether the permanent authorities can make wise and appropriate solutions to practical problems is enough to determine the direction of popular sentiment.</p>
<p>Today, China is a participating country in the war. It should use strong political power to ensure the rear and contribute materials. But this kind of work is closely related to practical problems. The following is an extension of the most important practical problems:</p>
<p>The first practical problem is public security. To ensure the rear, it is necessary to maintain public security. Unfortunately, in recent years, public security in the peaceful area has not only failed to improve, but bandits have also infested rural areas. Recently, in the four counties of Xi, Wu, and Cheng, there have been evil cults such as Xiantiandao and Jinguangdao, who have confused farmers and carried out vendettas. Furthermore, in large cities, people's lives are difficult due to high prices, and the public is panicked. If this continues, public security is worrying. The reason for the chaos of social order to this extreme is that in rural areas it is due to the enemy's fraud and the bullying of bad military police, which leads to public resentment and gives bandits an opportunity to take advantage of; in cities it is due to profiteers hoarding and speculating, which leads to crazy rises in the prices of goods. Therefore, the way to save the situation is to first purify officialdom and arrest treacherous merchants, and then guide the people and suppress bandits and evil. This accumulated work should start from a point and gradually extend to a surface, and should thoroughly understand the meaning of "using the death penalty in wartime" to catch both big and small fish in one fell swoop. As long as you are responsible, serious, and earnest in handling the matter, then the public security of the rear will definitely be stable.</p>
<p>The second practical problem is production. The consumption of materials in wartime is doubled compared to peacetime, and materials from distant places cannot be transported. If production is not increased, supply will inevitably fall short of demand. The impact of this is not only social poverty, but also leads to popular dissatisfaction and weakens political power. But simply chanting the slogan of "increasing production" is useless; it must be put into practice in order to be effective. For example, agricultural loans are one way to increase agricultural production. Other measures, such as providing factories with sufficient power, making the supply of raw materials and the transportation of machinery as convenient as possible, and training specialized industrial technicians, are all hoped to be discussed and implemented jointly by the authorities and the people.</p>
<p>The third practical problem is the people's food. This is the prerequisite for all problems. If people have enough food and their lives are stable, the people can fulfill their responsibilities and, with proper training, dedicate themselves to national policies. If the people do not have enough food and cannot make a living, the old and weak will die in the ditches, and the young and strong will take risks. The government will lose its foundation, and the impact on political power is obvious. Today, rice prices are soaring, and commodity prices are rising accordingly, and the people's food and livelihood are under great threat. If this fundamental practical problem is not solved, it will form a serious social crisis. Therefore, for this urgent food problem, the relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities should do their best to solve it quickly. On the negative side, it is hoped that an order will be issued to prohibit grain collection officers from burning rice piles, and to severely punish grain merchants for hoarding and speculating, so that the already insufficient food supply will no longer be artificially reduced, and that the high food prices will be suppressed to a considerable extent. On the positive side, it is hoped that on the one hand, the source of supply will be dredged quickly, and on the other hand, discussions will be held with the local allied authorities to borrow grain, and that distribution or fair sales will be implemented in the most critical period to stop the public's fear of food shortages and avoid causing adverse consequences. As for the most important countermeasure, it is to increase food production; the specific methods have been repeatedly listed in this newspaper before, so there is no need to repeat them here, just implement them!</p>
<p>"Governing does not lie in many words," "facts are the best propaganda," and the generation of political power is based on solving practical problems. The above three points are only the most fundamental problems. If they cannot be solved, how can we win the hearts of the people, how can we talk about political power, and how can we seek victory in war? This is by no means alarmist, and it is hoped that the authorities will consider it!</p>
<h3>Section Chief Shimada Speaks: Burmese-Japanese Forces Flank, Air Force Fiercely Attacks the West Dwina River's Right Bank</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The Shanghai Japanese Army Department's press conference, hosted yesterday morning at 11:30, featured Section Chief Shimada answering reporters' questions regarding the latest war situation in Burma.

<h3>Yesterday was the 18th Anti-Aircraft Day; Strict Drills Implemented; Sino-Japanese National Air Defense Ideas Harmoniously Exchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the 18th Anti-Aircraft Day. As usual, the city's air defense authorities conducted extensive propaganda on the meaning of air defense and implemented air defense drills. The entire day was spent in a state of air defense preparedness, with a highly tense atmosphere. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Alarm Drills</p>
<p>Alarm drills did not involve sounding sirens, but rather implementing alarm transmission drills. At 8:00 AM, a drill for issuing a pre-alarm was conducted. Each district transmitted the alarm using copper gongs, flags, telephones, etc. Each branch office dispatched personnel to inspect air raid shelters, air defense wells, and other air defense facilities for each neighborhood and family. Air defense personnel were also convened for briefings and to prepare for various air defense measures. At 4:00 PM, a drill for issuing an air raid alarm was conducted. In addition to transmitting the alarm using copper gongs, flags, telephones, etc., city-wide traffic control was implemented. All neighborhood personnel were mobilized to assist the police in directing traffic. Pedestrians were required to stand along the left side of the street for ten minutes before being allowed to walk on the left. All vehicles, except those with special identification, were prohibited from driving and were parked along the left side of the street. Strict enforcement was carried out. All entertainment venues suspended music, dancing, theater, and other forms of entertainment. At the same time, shelter drills were implemented. Air raid personnel guided residents to air raid shelters. All shops, banks, and various entertainment venues implemented shelter drills. Audiences were guided by the special self-defense teams and air defense teams of each venue to air raid shelters or appropriate locations. Each district designated appropriate addresses to conduct comprehensive air defense drills, including surveillance, sheltering, fire extinguishing, and rescue. The air raid alarm was lifted at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Lights Out</p>
<p>A pre-alarm lights out was implemented after sunset. At 9:00 PM, an air raid alarm drill was issued again. Lights out and traffic control were strictly enforced. No vehicles were allowed to pass, except for essential vehicles. Military police and neighborhood personnel organized lights out inspection teams to patrol their respective jurisdictions. All companies, shops, theaters, cafes, dance halls, hotels, and other entertainment venues were strictly prohibited from leaking light and were required to suspend entertainment. Violations would result in the inspection team recording the address or shop name, followed by power disconnection. Furthermore, a joint responsibility system was implemented, where entire neighborhoods and even groups of neighborhoods would face power disconnection. At the same time, each district implemented night-time comprehensive drills, with a particular focus on shelter drills. In the "blackout state," air raid personnel guided residents to air raid shelters and appropriate locations. At 10:00 PM, the air raid alarm drill was lifted. A pre-alarm lights out was implemented, and air raid prevention lights were restored until 10:30 PM, when the pre-alarm was completely lifted, and normal conditions were restored.</p>
<p>Local Drills</p>
<p>This local area comprehensive drill was held within the jurisdictions of the Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, and Zhabei branch offices. From morning to night, the chief and deputy chief of each branch office, along with the heads of each section, directed Sino-Japanese male and female neighborhood air defense personnel at key traffic intersections in each district to implement comprehensive air defense drills, including bomb disposal, fire extinguishing, rescue, sheltering, and surveillance. The Air Defense Headquarters and the Japanese military authorities dispatched personnel to inspect. Naval neighborhood personnel and Japanese male and female air defense team members showed great spirit and diligently trained. Military and police authorities addressed the Sino-Japanese air defense personnel after the drill, offering words of encouragement and expressing the hope that continued efforts would be made to promote harmonious exchange of air defense ideas in the Sino-Japanese integrated area and to create an unshakable foundation for the fundamental concept of defense.</p>
<p>District Exercises</p>
<p>Also, the Taishan district held a large-scale air defense drill at the intersection of Nantong Road and Daxing Road in Tingyunli at 3:00 PM. Commander Yamaguchi of the Shanghai Defense Command, Deputy Director Man Qiwei of the Police Bureau, Section Chief Hiraoka of the Second Section, Deputy Section Chief Okawa of the Neighborhood Section, and Director Noguchi of the General Affairs Section of the Air Defense Headquarters, along with other officials at various levels, inspected the scene. Police Captain Kobayashi and Chief Shi Sijian of the Taishan Branch Office served as commanders. Over two hundred people participated in the exercise, including the Police Corps and air defense neighborhood personnel from the district, creating a realistic scenario. After the exercise, Commander Yamaguchi and Deputy Director Man delivered speeches in succession. Similar large-scale drills were also conducted in the Jing'an Temple and Old Zhabei districts, commanded by the respective branch chiefs. Deputy Director Man and other responsible officials also inspected the scenes, with excellent results.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command</h3>
<p>To further invigorate civil defense activities during air raids, the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command will begin broadcasting air defense information starting from the 10th and has decided to issue a type of preparation alarm. The announcement is as follows:</p>
<p>Broadcasting Air Defense Information</p>
<p>To provide Shanghai citizens with appropriate and effective air defense measures, promote more vigorous civil defense activities, prevent unexpected damage and injury, eliminate rumors and enemy propaganda, and stabilize public morale, air defense information broadcasts will be implemented. These broadcasts will be transmitted via radio to general households and via street broadcasting towers or mobile loudspeaker vehicles for pedestrians.</p>
<p>Regulation of the Preparation Alarm</p>
<p>Before issuing a pre-alarm, to alert the general public and to indicate that enemy aircraft are approaching Shanghai or that a small number of enemy aircraft are threatening Shanghai airspace, allowing for judgment of the extremely low risk of bombing and to alert the general public to prepare for air defense measures (especially the strict implementation of lights out at night) while minimizing disruption to business operations, a new type of preparation alarm is being implemented, according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p>Issuance: A siren sound, one short blast every ten seconds. Cancellation: No siren sound. Broadcast via radio and street broadcasting towers.</p>
<p>Based on the actual situation, broadcasts and preparation alarms may also be issued beyond the two items mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Implementation of Securities Transaction Tax Postponed for Several Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Division of the Ministry of Finance began collecting the temporary profit income tax on securities transactions on the 7th of this month. The Bureau has now completed the printing of all transaction certificates and distributed them to the Huashang Securities Exchange for distribution to brokers yesterday. According to news from the Huashang Securities Exchange, due to the complexity of the procedures regarding the securities transaction income tax, many brokers have not yet fully understood it. Therefore, a request has been made to the Collection Bureau to postpone implementation until the procedures are fully prepared, at which time taxes will be paid in accordance with regulations. Temporary postponement for a few days has been approved.</p>
<h3>Police Bust Drug Manufacturing Plant; Large-Scale Production in Enemy-Owned Housing</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Police Bureau's Third Section Narcotics Investigation Unit learned that someone was using enemy-owned housing at the end of Daxilu Road, west of the railway, to manufacture drugs on a large scale. The details were reported to Li Shiyu, Chief of the Third Section, who instructed Wu Xiquan, Chief of the Narcotics Investigation Unit, to actively investigate. After a week of detailed investigation, at 9:30 AM on June 7, Wu Xiquan, Chief of the Narcotics Investigation Unit, and Ito Fumio, Deputy Chief, led Section Members Jin Hongkang and Pang Hao, along with all unit members and military police, to 6 Yili Road, West Shanghai, where they busted the drug manufacturing operation. Six individuals, including drug technician Shen Jusheng, were apprehended. Approximately 100 taels of finished heroin, as well as raw materials, semi-finished products, manufacturing equipment, chemicals, and other items, were seized, with a total value of over 150 million yuan. After detailed interrogation at the Bureau, it was learned that the operator of the drug operation was named Ye Peng (also known as Ye Gongfu), the current Chairman of the Board of Dasen Qianzhuang on Beijing Road. Section Member Jin was dispatched with plainclothes police officers Ding Zhaogan and Zhu Xihui to Dasen Qianzhuang, where Ye Peng was apprehended. Ye Peng confessed to having studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan in his early years and enjoyed studying chemistry. He began manufacturing drugs as early as 1941 and gradually expanded the operation until today. The rented enemy property was leased from a Japanese national. The case is currently under thorough investigation. The bust of this drug operation will greatly help eliminate the atmosphere of drug use.</p>
<h3>Scope of Navigation Management Rights Determined</h3>

Navigation within the boundaries of the city shall be under the management of the Municipal Construction Bureau.</p>
<h3>Minister Kuwahara Explains the Pacific War Situation; First Meeting with Press Corps Since Taking Office</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Naval Fleet Press Minister, Colonel Kuwahara, met with local Chinese and foreign reporters at the Naval Attaché's Office at 2:00 PM yesterday for his first meeting since taking office. He gave an impromptu explanation of the Pacific War situation and future trends in the enemy's mainland operations. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Since Colonel Matsushima's reassignment, the position of Press Minister has been temporarily held concurrently by myself. However, I have little experience in this task and hope that everyone present will offer much guidance. Today, I will start with a discussion of the recent Pacific War situation as an introductory conversation.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle on Okinawa</p>
<p>The Pacific War situation centers around Okinawa Island, where Japanese and American forces are still engaged in a fierce battle. This intense battle is truly the prelude to the future decisive battle between Japan and the United States. The Japanese military is utilizing the best tactics to make the enemy bleed, as everyone is already well aware. The Japanese military's method of operation is to inflict maximum casualties on the enemy. The target of attack is enemy transport ships around Okinawa. The number of ships sunk or damaged has already exceeded 560, which the enemy can no longer conceal and has announced. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal has requested more trained and skilled workers to repair ships, and Nimitz has also acknowledged the significant damage to ships and manpower. Therefore, significant obstacles to future operations are inevitable.</p>
<p>Significant Increase in American Casualties</p>
<p>The number of deaths among U.S. naval personnel is increasing significantly, as is the case on land. For example, the damages announced by the U.S. military yesterday (the 8th) showed an increase of 3,347 in the Navy compared to last week, bringing the total to 116,215. On land, there was an increase of 9,162 compared to last week, bringing the total to 895,834. This shows how much the enemy has bled in one week. The Japanese military is continuing to advance with this operational goal in mind and is confident that the enemy's damage will continue to expand significantly, causing them to lose their will to fight. The most important moment in warfare is the final five minutes. We must fight thoroughly and resolutely to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Prepared for Enemy Action</p>
<p>Colonel Kuwahara also answered two questions from reporters:</p>
<p>(Question) The decisive battle on Okinawa is intensifying. How will this impact China if the war takes a new turn?</p>
<p>(Answer) The battle on Okinawa is currently intensifying. We will never allow the enemy to suppress us arbitrarily. Assuming that the enemy gains control of the area, the focus of attention will be on the enemy's air operations against China. At this time, the enemy air base will be closer to mainland China, and their air force will have the potential to be more active along the Chinese coast. Large-scale active operations may be carried out against Shanghai, Qingdao, Nanjing, and other places. However, it is impossible to predict the actual situation without consulting Nimitz. In short, we are prepared and have made adequate preparations.</p>
<p>Landing Operations Will Be Met with Resistance</p>
<p>(Question) What are the trends in mainland operations?</p>
<p>(Answer) The conclusion to this question is that no matter how abundant the resources of the United States, it will be difficult to achieve a quick victory. Assuming that the enemy attempts landing operations, the first problem will be manpower. In the past, considerable manpower was required for remote islands such as Okinawa and Iwo Jima. In the battle on Okinawa, each American soldier had to be accompanied by 1.6 tons of ammunition. If 100,000 soldiers are deployed, 16 tons of supplies will be required each day. Since the enemy has already suffered serious blows in the battle on Okinawa, the difficulties they will face in terms of personnel transport will be evident. Secondly, the closer the enemy gets to Japan's important bases, the greater the resistance they will face. Therefore, even if the enemy intends to launch a landing operation, the Japanese military will inflict a serious blow.</p>
<p>Colonel Kuwahara's Brief Biography</p>
