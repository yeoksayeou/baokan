<h3>對呂宋島敵兩翼　日軍作猛烈攻擊　羅沙留附近展開激烈戰鬥</h3>
<p>菲律賓前線基地三十日中央社電　呂宋島敵軍右翼南下部隊，蒙受日軍猛烈攻擊後，於克拉克機塲北端，已停止前進。班班西方高地一帶之日軍，自二十日以來，即開始猛攻在左　之敵軍，同時，日砲兵亦隨處活動，向敵射擊。又敵軍之一部曾侵入馬巴拉卡特西方高地，着手飛機基地軍之整備，並於班多阿拉亞特附近設置小規模之機場，且已停有飛機若干架。此外，洛扎尼斯方面之戰線，二十五日以來，頗呈平靜，日軍自敵軍登陸以來，於卡巴期山方面猛擊潰敗數軍，復於二十四日在半敢行突衡攻擊。呂宋島敵登陸之兵力，已達七個師團，其中有戰車部隊，然敵軍仍企圖增强防地兵力，故二十八日又有一師團於仁牙因灣開始登陸，斯黎高海峽方面，更有敵運輸船釣八十艘，企圖增加兵力。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地三十日中央社電　呂宋島敵軍擬向薩發昻東方前進，遭日軍猛攻後，仍執拗砲擊羅沙留，擬制壓巴歧俄鎭方面，二十八日傳，敵軍從二十四日以來，猛攻羅沙留附近，以塔拉克爲基地，刻於羅沙留西北至該地北方卡爾加拉間集結兵力約四千五百各，並擁有迫擊砲，日軍對此方面，於砲兵部隊協力下，加以猛烈反攻，刻正數鬥中。又自西北方面北上之敵軍約一大隊，二十五日晨侵入阿扣特北方，另一隊敵軍侵八挨斯加蘭特，然該方日軍予以激擊，已慶莫大戰果。</p>
<p>菲律賓前線日軍基地三十日中央社電　日航空部隊，二十八日攻擊仁牙因灣之敵艦船，擊毀大型運輸船二艘。另一隊日機强襲豐法比安敵機傷，數處中彈起火。</p>
<h3>敵美隱瞞損失數字　掩蔽國民耳目　出陸軍報道部長談話</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）盟邦日本駐滬陸軍報道部長出淵中佐昨對中外記者發表談話如次：</p>
<p>隱瞞自身之多量出血，因短期決戰而焦慮之敵美當局，由戰局之苛　，益顯出其欺瞞本國人士之荒謬，美陸軍部長史汀生，於一月二十五日發表開戰以來美陸軍之損失，在六十一萬六千人以上，其中十一萬七千人不明，更於最近稱：陸海軍損失共七十萬一千九百五十人，內戰死者一四九·六五〇人，負傷者三九五·三二六人，不明者九六·〇六五人，被俘者六一·九〇九人，人的資源涸竭，乃爲美國最大之弱點，當不待重加指摘者，故美軍所發表之人員損失中，每對死傷者付之厥如，其所以如此遮蔽國民之衆目者，不可不謂出於當局之居心積慮之施策也。</p>
<p>兵士罹疾</p>
<p>去年九月美國「礦工」雜誌發表此次戰爭中，美軍對戰爭之認眞，較之上次大戰，已呈每况愈下之勢，於戰綫上發作精神病之士兵，亦爲數不少，當局對此等治療之煩惱極加指摘，因其中百分之五之患者，返還後方，待受專門之醫治，因精神病之故，及今擬免除兵役者，占免役者總數之百分之六。一九三四年度之發表稱：精神病收容所中，每月有患者八萬五千人，且日有增加，基於上數自戰爭開始以迄於一九四四年九月推定美軍中精神病患者，不在四百萬之下。一九三四年度，求治者約五百七十萬人，患者如此增多，實爲美當局當前之難題。又據最近曾着有作攻聯合軍軍醫參考之「熟帶病必備」一書之哥達博士稱：美軍確於海外不明原因而得此難於預防之熱帶病而歸還，現在已形成嚴重問題之瘧疾，前綫將士多數已爲傳染，其對策惟有歸國以防止很發，興加緊撲蚊。由以上所述，不難想見於世界全戰綫中有瘴　之地帶惡戰苦鬥之士兵，常有相當之患者，根據去年五月澳洲之廣播：駐當地美軍曾向澳洲政府要求容有二萬七千五百具病床之醫院，以供美國將士使用，因此澳洲醫院不敷，一般人民極感困難，澳洲人對美軍司令之不使傷兵歸送本國，頗引爲費解云。</p>
<p>人力缺乏</p>
<p>美當局於國人前如何遮蔽英人員之喪失，終爲極煩惱之事，最近馬欠馬克文司基氏之論說：根據美國戰事情報局之發表，美軍於對日作戰中，已戰死二十七萬人之衆，日軍至少亦有四百萬之兵力，若作如是想，此死亡率頗不在少，惟日軍於此四百萬以外，尙有二百萬之預備兵，此爲減少自身之損失，但亦承認日本人力之富足，形成極矛盾之宣傳。更於去年十二月二日，美聯社華盛頓所發表之關於菲島作戰之電報中，公然承認日軍之優勢，且謂聯合軍方面作戰補給與人的資源等問題叢生，補給綫長達數千哩，較歐洲戰塲之補給綫更長三倍云。</p>
<p>徵用黑人</p>
<p>爲求以上難題得以解決，最近美當局以物之代價，而使他國民族臨於戰場，欲避免自身之消耗，而逞其　制世界之野心，即去年十二月公開宣佈黑人六十六萬四千名之徵用，特戈爾軍隊一百二十萬名之編成，義大利亡命政權靑年之動員，對重慶軍隊之美國化等人的資源之活用手段，不勝枚舉，此關於民族之發展，及世界之福運，有重大關鍵，此事之解決，實爲授予有識人士之重大使命。</p>
<h3>日航空部隊　夜襲雷伊泰</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地三十日中央社電　日航空部隊二十七日夜攻擊雷伊泰島西岸巴倫本附近之敵軍陣地，由低空加以掃射。</p>
<h3>大宮島日孤軍　續作游擊戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電　據美泰晤士雜誌十二月二十五日號載稱：一美軍早對國民宣告已確保大宮島，然該島戰鬥並未結束，日軍自停止有組織之攻擊後，其殘留兵士仍隱藏於坵陵之內，最近陸戰隊曾發動掃蕩作戰，諒此種之搜索作戰，今後更將繼續數月之久，美軍以擴聲器勸告日軍投降，然均遭拒絕，日軍始終繼續抗戰。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>改造上海</h3>
<p>提起「上海」，便不能不連想到美英帝國主義之僅略，一方面由沙灘而造成重鎭，同時亦形成一支離割裂之市政，爲古今中外所未有。因此一切卑鄙之惡勢力得醖蓄於其中，一切畸形之怪現象得容納於其中，加以中外宵小狼狽爲奸，有形與無形之越貨殺人得猖擾於上海，政治之污垢危亂之萌芽得滋生於上海，而中國之厄運遂根伏於此。</p>
<p>所幸經我當局之努力，盟邦日本之協力，終於前年八月一日所有租界全部收回，從此庶有撥雲醫而見靑天之望，當時各界人士莫不表示歡欣與期待，對於建設新生上海之意見亦莫不各就所見作片段之貢獻，情况熱烈良有以也。在此一年半中，改進之處固非絕無，然官吏貪汚之風未戢，民間擾攘之風日熾，雖其由來有漸，而所以能變本加厲者，無非治理未有系統，措施未能徹底耳。</p>
<p>今周市長偕羅秘書長銜命來滬主持市政，下車之日，各界表示歡迎，痛陳疾苦，半月問政　所播，足使頑夫廉懦夫有立志，是表面之現象已見好轉，則根本之　結亦亟應加以剷除。同時有計劃有步驟而各方面顯到之建設，亦亟應加以準備着手實施，蓋一時脊小之匿跡，有震於成名者，有脅於重典者，務再使之安居樂業心悅誠服，以遠於垂拱而治無爲而冶之境，而無習則　生死灰復燃之慮。</p>
<p>欲建設一市，固然頭緒紛繁，欲改造一市，尤感牽掣複雜。同時在此泱戰期中，更嫌其迂腐遼闊，不切時宜。但在處此前後八年之戰爭中，上海仍不能適應戰時體制者，正因其未能理淸頭緒摒除牽掣，若早能從大處着想從小處着手，按步就班逐漸推進，則平時之紀律足以助長戰時之實力，戰時之訓練足以促進平時之生聚，戰時與平時自有其共同之要素與夫連鎖之關繫，（參閱本報三十三年十二月二十八日社許），如物之表裏有始終不可分離者。苟欲建設面目一新之大上海，既不應顧慮紛繁複雜而望之却步，更不應以戰爭時期爲藉口而祗求苟安，但能盡力耕耘，則必能獲致應有收獲。</p>
<p>改造上海之前提有四：（一）在任何方面須徵底革除支離割裂之舊習，而形成一具有實質上一元化之新上海。（二）省市本隸屬於中央，欲使一市建全，除本市行政官憲所可局部作確定者外，其有待於中央通盤籌劃之處甚多，故應將所有問題分爲應由中央解決者及可由地方解決者二種，一方面平行推進，一方面互相交織，方可達到全盤的前後呼應的市政之改造。（三）一切政治上之現象社會之風氣，莫非心理之反應，欲使改造而收效，非在心理上有所建設不爲功。（四）計劃旣定，貴在實施，若無一健全合理之機構，則不特事倍功半效率低微，抑且尾大不掉難以推行。將此四大前提認淸之後，再提供一改造上海方案之輪廓如下，以備參考。</p>
<p>所有改造問題就橫的方面可分爲四項：一曰敎，二曰養，三曰衛，四曰管。就縱的方面可分爲三項：一曰檢討舊有之缺陷，二曰釐訂改造之方案，三曰規定工作之進度。然後分頭進行按期　效，以三個月爲計劃時期，三年爲完成時期，則四年之後不但上海之面目一新，而影響於全國之敎養衛管亦必至深且鉅。願在其位者不畏艱險而領導於上，民問同心協力而擁護於下，一洗「上海爲萬惡之　」之恥，而建立「上海爲中國爲世界模範市」之聲譽。</p>
<h3>歐洲政治舞台美蘇外交鬥爭</h3>
<p>預測此次大戰中今年的動向，不但要研究其軍事情勢，還要透澈觀察其政治的趨勢，據傳本月底舉行羅邱史三頭會談，共意風究在何處？本年度一般世界政情的眞相又何如？這些都是具有重大影響的問題。因此、檢討去年最後一季中業已表面化的各種情勢，用以觀察本年度世界政治的動向，實不失爲當前的要務。</p>
<p>蘇法同盟影響</p>
<p>第一項重要相，就是英蘇在法國問題上的暗鬥。由於蘇法同盟的成立，英國已被迫喝下一杯　湯。當史太林與特戈爾在莫斯科開始會談前的頃刻，英關恰巧爲兩件事完全吸住了注意力。那就是義大利政變的危機，及希臘內亂的勃發。就義大利政變而論，英國一貫支持波諾米政權，但波諾米內閣的生死權却完全操在共產黨手中。</p>
<p>英國所要的只是面子，而蘇法同盟的成立，英國不但失去了實質，連面子也不能保全了。以蘇法同盟爲界，歐洲政局已踏入全新的階段。邱吉爾曾先後於去年十二月五日十五日兩天，在下院發表關於希臘內亂及波蘭問題的演說。對於希　問題，他的演說非常强硬，完全是不列顚帝國宰相的口吻，與美國國務鄉史汀蒂紐斯的抗議針鋒相對，同時並警告蘇法同盟的成立，力言希臘內亂的原因即在「企圖實現無產階級獨裁制」。但其十五日關於波蘭問題的演說，則顯然比前者軟弱，充滿讓步的哀求的慶調。邱吉爾於此曾要求波蘭亡命政權接受蘇聯的國境線要求，這大的由於他已預感蘇法同盟成立後，蘇法將以同一步調，迫英國承認　布林政權的緣故吧。</p>
<p>其後，特戈爾政權與　布林政　權交換外交代表，而法國左派復與莫斯科電台的反駁彼蘭要求取得西里西亞呼應，提出取得萊　西岸的要求（此與英美的該地帶國際管理案相反）。</p>
<p>第二項據義大利左翼方面的報道，結成巴爾幹多瑙河集團的時機行將成熟，其中心便在保加利亞，包括希臘在內，將由莫斯科指導。</p>
<p>第三項即爲蘇聯承認盧布林政權。以上各點均與蘇法同盟一脈相通。另一方面，邱吉爾的訪問希臘，結果毫無所得·一九四四年的慕就這樣在蘇聯奇妙的沉默中漸漸閉合。</p>
<p>英國日趨孤立</p>
<p>如此看來，今年歐洲政情最大的特徵，可說就是英國陷於脫離歐洲而孤立的慢性危機中。由於　法同盟的成立，歐洲的勢力均衡已告打破。英國現正努力想爭回　樓已倒的舊勢力圈，企圖拉　義大利和希臘。但其立塲已日益困苦。英國的外交·和蘇聯的積極方式相對，逐漸乏力招架，其最大原因，可說就在於美國的後援自去年最後一季以來已幾乎沒有了的緣故。此種美國對於歐洲問題的消極化，乃是該期間的顯著事實，頗可注意。這事有種種原因，要的之不外下列數</p>
<p>（一）去秋美國選舉大總統時福由於選舉戰略上的關係，傾於太平洋方而軍事上的成功，故使美國對於默洲政治所抱的態度，趨於韜晦。</p>
<p>（二）十一月美國實行改組國務院。</p>
<p>（三）美國大資本家，對確立以戰後在經濟上支配世界爲目標的大戰善後方案，及其準備行動的要求·羅斯福勢非接受不可。</p>
<p>不過，雖然有這些原因存在，但是美國對於歐洲問題尙未完全不感興趣，例如去年十一月間舉行的國際航空會議上及國際商業會議中所見，以美國第十主義爲基礎的會議外交，依然由國際安全保障會議及通貨會議等繼續推行。</p>
<p>美改對歐政策</p>
<p>唯一的問題，可說是去年末季以來美國的對歐政第顯已發生一大變化。發生此種變化的主要原因，想起來當有左列數點：</p>
<p>（一）英美兩國大實業家對於戰後的預測不同。</p>
<p>（二）此種對立由美國參院反映於華盛頓政界。</p>
<p>（三）爲避免美國的支配而組織西歐集團，以國確保歐洲立脚點的英國最後掙扎，增加美國對英不信任的心理。</p>
<p>加之歐洲政情的變化又甚明顯，結果使美國第一主義的國際會議外交也不違修正了。</p>
<p>事實上，這一連串的會議外交已因蘇聯始終不肯參加而完全失欺了。如何推諉由各次會議的決定事項所生的義務，日成英國以下反軸心各小國的煩惱。犯了幼稚病的美國外交，至此遂告完全失敗。尤其是蘇法同盟的成立，乃是蘇法向唐巴頓·奧克斯夢　的挑戰，因此美國的對歐政策更加消極化起來了。</p>
<p>英國已成配角</p>
<p>那末，美國今後的對歐政策將循着什麼路線進行呢？在對蘇政策方面預料在全歐展開英美共同戰線的所謂美國「外交反攻」，頗有某種程度的可能性。謠傳羅斯福將於最近訪問倫敦，此行對於歐洲集團的結成不無關係，實堪注目。</p>
<p>與此相對，蘇聯則向英國提出英法蘇三國同盟案，以圖阻撓美國取得歐洲領導權，同時妨礙英法結成同盟，而以孤立化的恐怖脅迫邱古爾。</p>
<p>於此可注目者，即英美兩國對於蘇處此項外交攻勢的煩惱，其間大有差別，蓋美國所受蘇聯的影響。尙未如處於孤立化危機中的英國之大。職是之故，爲資本主義陣營代表的美國，將於何時並如何反攻蘇聯的外交攻勢，可說是本年度値得關心的大事。從而本年度國際舞臺上的主角，在反軸心方面將是美蘇兩國，英國則和法國一樣，成爲次要的配角。反軸心陣營間的這種對立，即在三頭會談實現時，也沒有即可消弭的道理。</p>
<p>我們對於英美蘇三國，須注意他們如何努力將這對立的重點移諸其他問題。大致對日問題頗有被他們重視的可能性，而反日宣傳的强化，諒必亦非不可能。由這觀點看來，我們對於歐洲問題作正確的觀察，有絕對必要·（田口特派員蘇黎克十三日特電譯自一月十五日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>Against the Enemy's Two Wings on Luzon Island, Japanese Forces Launch a Fierce Attack; Intense Battle Unfolds Near Rosales</h3>
<p>Philippines Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces of the right wing southward advancing unit on Luzon Island, after sustaining a fierce attack by Japanese forces, have halted their advance at the northern end of Clark Airfield. Japanese forces in the vicinity of the western highlands of Bamban have been fiercely attacking the enemy on the left flank since the 20th. Simultaneously, Japanese artillery is also actively moving around, firing upon the enemy. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy forces has infiltrated the western highlands of Mabalacat, commencing the preparation of an aircraft base, and has established a small-scale airfield near Bando Arayat, where several aircraft are already stationed. In addition, the battle line in the direction of Los Baños has been relatively calm since the 25th. Since the enemy's landing, Japanese forces have fiercely attacked and routed several enemy units in the direction of Cabanatuan, and on the 24th, launched a daring counterattack. The enemy's landing force on Luzon Island has reached seven divisions, including tank units. However, the enemy still attempts to reinforce their defensive forces, so another division began landing in Lingayen Gulf on the 28th. In the direction of San Bernardino Strait, there are as many as eighty enemy transport ships attempting to increase their forces.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Base in the Philippines, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces on Luzon Island, intending to advance eastward towards San Fabian, after sustaining a fierce attack by Japanese forces, stubbornly continue to bombard Rosales, attempting to suppress the area around Paniqui Town. On the 28th, it was reported that since the 24th, enemy forces have been fiercely attacking the vicinity of Rosales, using Tarlac as a base, and are currently concentrating approximately 4,500 troops between the northwest of Rosales and Calaggaran to the north of that location, and possess mortars. Against this, Japanese forces, with the cooperation of artillery units, are launching a fierce counteroffensive and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Furthermore, approximately one large battalion of enemy forces advancing northward from the northwest infiltrated north of Alcott on the morning of the 25th, and another unit of enemy forces infiltrated Bayambang. However, the Japanese forces in that area fiercely attacked them, resulting in a significant victory.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Base on the Philippines Frontline, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 28th, Japanese air units attacked enemy warships in Lingayen Gulf, destroying two large transport ships. Another unit of Japanese aircraft strongly attacked Fabrica airfield, causing damage with several hits and fires.</p>
<h3>Enemy Americans Concealing Loss Figures to Deceive the Public; Statement by the Army Information Department Chief</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch) - Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, the Army Information Department Chief of the Allied Japanese forces stationed in Shanghai, made the following statement to Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday:</p>
<p>The enemy American authorities, concealing their own massive losses, and anxious about a short-term decisive battle, are revealing the absurdity of their deception of their own people due to the severity of the war situation. On January 25th, the U.S. Secretary of War, Stimson, announced that the U.S. Army's losses since the beginning of the war were over 616,000, of which 117,000 were unaccounted for. More recently, he stated that the total losses of the Army and Navy were 701,950, including 149,650 dead, 395,326 wounded, 96,065 unaccounted for, and 61,909 captured. The depletion of human resources is the greatest weakness of the United States, which need not be reiterated. Therefore, the U.S. military's announcements of personnel losses consistently omit the numbers of dead and wounded. The reason for concealing this from the public eye must be attributed to the deliberate policies of the authorities.</p>
<p>Soldier Illnesses</p>
<p>Last September, the American "Miner" magazine published that in this war, the U.S. military's dedication to the war is increasingly declining compared to the last World War. A considerable number of soldiers are developing mental illnesses on the front lines. The authorities are extremely concerned about the trouble of treating these individuals, as 5% of the patients are being sent back to the rear for specialized medical treatment. Those seeking exemption from military service due to mental illness now account for 6% of the total number of exemptions. A 1934 report stated that mental hospitals housed 85,000 patients per month, and the number is increasing daily. Based on these figures, it is estimated that since the beginning of the war until September 1944, there were no fewer than 4 million mental illness patients in the U.S. military. In 1934, approximately 5.7 million people sought treatment. This increase in patients is a current challenge for the U.S. authorities. Furthermore, according to Dr. Gotha, who recently authored "Handbook of Tropical Diseases," a reference for Allied military doctors, U.S. soldiers are indeed returning from overseas with tropical diseases that are difficult to prevent and of unknown origin. Malaria, which has now become a serious problem, has infected a large number of frontline soldiers. The only solutions are repatriation to prevent outbreaks and intensified mosquito control. From the above, it is not difficult to imagine that soldiers fighting hard battles in malaria-prone areas on all global fronts often have a considerable number of patients. According to an Australian broadcast last May, U.S. forces stationed there requested the Australian government to provide hospitals with 27,500 beds for U.S. soldiers. As a result, Australian hospitals are insufficient, causing great difficulties for the general public. Australians find it difficult to understand why the U.S. military commander does not send the wounded back to their home country.</p>
<p>Manpower Shortage</p>
<p>How the U.S. authorities conceal the loss of British personnel from their own people is ultimately a matter of great concern. According to a recent commentary by Mr. Max Macvensky, based on the U.S. Office of War Information's announcement, 270,000 U.S. soldiers have died in the war against Japan. If one assumes that the Japanese army has at least 4 million troops, this mortality rate is quite significant. However, in addition to these 4 million, the Japanese army still has 2 million reserve troops. This is a contradictory advertisement aimed at reducing their own losses, but also acknowledging the abundance of Japanese manpower. Furthermore, on December 2nd of last year, an Associated Press dispatch from Washington regarding the Philippine operations openly acknowledged the superiority of the Japanese army and stated that the Allied forces faced numerous problems regarding operational supplies and human resources. The supply line is thousands of miles long, three times longer than the supply line in the European theater.</p>
<p>Conscription of Black People</p>
<p>In order to solve the above problems, the U.S. authorities recently used material rewards to bring other nations to the battlefield in order to avoid their own losses and pursue their ambition to dominate the world. This includes the public announcement last December of the conscription of 664,000 black people, the formation of 1.2 million Gurkha troops, the mobilization of youth from the Italian exile government, and the Americanization of the Chongqing army as numerous means of utilizing human resources. This has significant implications for the development of nations and the well-being of the world. Resolving this matter is a significant mission entrusted to informed individuals.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Units Conduct Night Raid on Leyte</h3>
<p>Philippines Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 27th, Japanese air units attacked enemy positions near Balumbon on the west coast of Leyte Island, strafing them from low altitude.</p>
<h3>Japanese Isolated Forces on Omiya Island Continue Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Seoul, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the December 25th issue of the American *Time* magazine, although the U.S. military had earlier declared to the public that it had secured Omiya Island, the fighting on the island has not ended. After ceasing organized attacks, the remaining Japanese soldiers are still hiding in the hills. Recently, the Marine Corps launched a mopping-up operation. It is expected that this type of search operation will continue for several months. The U.S. military used loudspeakers to persuade the Japanese soldiers to surrender, but all were rejected. The Japanese soldiers continue to resist to the end.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reconstructing Shanghai</h3>
<p>The mention of "Shanghai" inevitably brings to mind the encroachment of American and British imperialism. On the one hand, a major city was created from a sandbank, but at the same time, a fragmented and divided municipality was formed, unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. As a result, all despicable evil forces could be nurtured within it, and all abnormal and strange phenomena could be accommodated within it. Furthermore, Chinese and foreign criminals colluded with each other, and overt and covert smuggling and murder raged in Shanghai. The filth of politics and the seeds of unrest were sown in Shanghai, and China's misfortune was rooted here.</p>
<p>Fortunately, through the efforts of our authorities and the cooperation of Allied Japan, all concessions were finally recovered on August 1st of the year before last. From then on, there was hope of seeing the blue sky after the clouds were cleared. At that time, people from all walks of life expressed joy and anticipation, and everyone contributed their opinions on the construction of a new Shanghai from their own perspectives. The situation was enthusiastic and well-founded. In the past year and a half, there have been improvements, but the trend of official corruption has not been curbed, and the trend of civil unrest has intensified. Although its origins have gradually increased, the reason why it has been able to escalate is simply that the governance has not been systematic and the measures have not been thorough.</p>
<p>Now, Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo have come to Shanghai under orders to preside over municipal administration. On the day of their arrival, people from all walks of life expressed their welcome and bitterly complained about their hardships. In half a month, the sounds of seeking policy have spread, enough to make the stubborn and weak have aspirations. The surface phenomenon has already improved, and the fundamental problems should also be eradicated urgently. At the same time, planned, step-by-step, and comprehensive construction should also be prepared and implemented. The temporary disappearance of petty villains may be due to fear of fame or coercion by severe penalties. We must ensure that they live and work in peace, and are sincerely convinced, so as to be far from the realm of governing by doing nothing, and avoid the worry of old habits recurring and lost causes being revived.</p>
<p>To build a city is certainly complicated, but to reconstruct a city is even more difficult and complex. At the same time, during this wartime period, it is even more prone to being pedantic, broad, and impractical. However, the reason why Shanghai has not been able to adapt to the wartime system during the past eight years of war is precisely because it has failed to sort out the complexities and eliminate the obstacles. If it had been possible to think big and start small, and gradually advance step by step, then peacetime discipline would have been sufficient to boost wartime strength, and wartime training would have been sufficient to promote peacetime development. Wartime and peacetime have their common elements and chain relationships (see this newspaper's editorial on December 28, 1944), like the inside and outside of things, which cannot be separated from beginning to end. If we want to build a brand-new Shanghai, we should not be deterred by the complexity and shrink back, nor should we use the wartime as an excuse to seek only temporary peace. As long as we work hard, we will surely reap the rewards we deserve.</p>
<p>There are four prerequisites for reconstructing Shanghai: (1) In any aspect, we must thoroughly eliminate the old habits of fragmentation and division, and form a new Shanghai that has substantive unity. (2) The province and city are subordinate to the central government. To make a city healthy, in addition to the local municipal administrative officials who can make local determinations, there are many aspects that require the central government to make overall plans. Therefore, all problems should be divided into two types: those that should be solved by the central government and those that can be solved by the local government. On the one hand, they should be promoted in parallel, and on the other hand, they should be intertwined with each other, in order to achieve the overall reconstruction of the municipal administration with front-to-back coordination. (3) All political phenomena and social customs are nothing more than psychological reactions. If we want the reconstruction to be effective, it will not be successful without psychological construction. (4) Once the plan is determined, the key is to implement it. Without a sound and reasonable organization, not only will the effort be doubled with half the results and the efficiency be low, but it will also be difficult to manage and difficult to promote. After recognizing these four major prerequisites, we will provide an outline of a plan to reconstruct Shanghai as follows for reference.</p>
<p>All reconstruction problems can be divided into four categories from a horizontal perspective: first, education; second, sustenance; third, health; and fourth, management. From a vertical perspective, they can be divided into three categories: first, examining the existing defects; second, formulating a reconstruction plan; and third, stipulating the progress of the work. Then proceed separately and measure the effectiveness on schedule, with three months as the planning period and three years as the completion period. Then, after four years, not only will Shanghai's appearance be brand new, but the impact on the country's education, sustenance, health, and management will also be profound and significant. We hope that those in position will not be afraid of difficulties and dangers and will lead from above, and that the people will work together with one heart and support from below, so as to wash away the shame of "Shanghai being the source of all evils" and establish the reputation of "Shanghai being a model city for China and the world."</p>
<h3>The Diplomatic Struggle Between the US and the Soviet Union on the European Political Stage</h3>
<p>To predict the trends of this war this year, it is necessary not only to study the military situation but also to thoroughly observe the political trends. It is rumored that the Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin three-party summit will be held at the end of this month. Where does the common intention lie? What is the truth of the general world political situation this year? These are all questions that have a major impact. Therefore, reviewing the various situations that have already surfaced in the last quarter of last year to observe the trend of world politics this year is indeed an important task at present.</p>
<p>The Influence of the Franco-Soviet Alliance</p>
<p>The first important point is the secret struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union on the French issue. Due to the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, Britain has been forced to swallow a bitter pill. When Stalin and de Gaulle began their talks in Moscow, Britain happened to be completely absorbed by two events: the crisis of the Italian coup and the outbreak of the Greek civil war. As far as the Italian coup is concerned, Britain has consistently supported the Bonomi government, but the power of life and death of the Bonomi cabinet is entirely in the hands of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>What Britain wants is only face, but with the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, Britain not only lost substance but also could not keep face. Taking the Franco-Soviet alliance as the boundary, the European political situation has entered a new stage. Churchill made speeches on the Greek civil war and the Polish issue in the House of Commons on December 5th and 15th of last year. Regarding the Greek issue, his speech was very tough, completely in the tone of the Prime Minister of the British Empire, and was sharply opposed to the protest of the US Secretary of State Stettinius. At the same time, he warned against the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, and strongly stated that the cause of the Greek civil war was "the attempt to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat." However, his speech on the Polish issue on the 15th was obviously weaker than the former, full of concessions, pleading, and celebrations. Churchill had asked the Polish government-in-exile to accept the Soviet Union's border requirements. This was largely due to his premonition that after the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, the Soviet Union and France would force Britain to recognize the Lublin government in the same step.</p>
<p>After that, the de Gaulle government and the Lublin government exchanged diplomatic representatives, and the French leftists echoed the Moscow radio's refutation of Poland's request to acquire Silesia, and proposed to acquire the west bank of the Rhine (which is contrary to the British and American international management plan for the area).</p>
<p>The second point is that according to reports from the Italian left wing, the time for the formation of the Balkan-Danube Group is approaching, and its center is in Bulgaria, including Greece, which will be guided by Moscow.</p>
<p>The third point is the Soviet Union's recognition of the Lublin government. The above points are all in line with the Franco-Soviet alliance. On the other hand, Churchill's visit to Greece yielded nothing. The year 1944 thus gradually closed in the Soviet Union's wonderful silence.</p>
<p>Britain is Increasingly Isolated</p>
<p>From this point of view, the biggest feature of the European political situation this year can be said to be that Britain is in a chronic crisis of being isolated from Europe. Due to the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, the balance of power in Europe has been broken. Britain is now working hard to regain the old sphere of influence that has collapsed and is trying to pull in Italy and Greece. But its position is becoming increasingly difficult. Britain's diplomacy, in contrast to the Soviet Union's active approach, is gradually becoming powerless to resist. The biggest reason for this can be said to be that US support has been almost non-existent since the last quarter of last year. This American passivity towards European issues is a significant fact during that period and is worthy of attention. There are various reasons for this, but the main ones are:</p>
<p>(1) When the United States elected the president last autumn, Roosevelt tended to the Pacific side due to election strategy and military success, so the United States' attitude towards European politics tended to be cautious.</p>
<p>(2) The United States reorganized the State Department in November.</p>
<p>(3) American capitalists demanded that Roosevelt accept the post-war plan to establish economic dominance over the world after the war, and its preparatory actions.</p>
<p>However, although these reasons exist, the United States is not completely uninterested in European issues. For example, as seen in the International Aviation Conference and the International Commercial Conference held in November last year, conference diplomacy based on the American Tenth Doctrine is still being promoted by the International Security Assurance Conference and the Currency Conference.</p>
<p>US Changes Policy Towards Europe</p>
<p>The only question is that the US policy towards Europe has obviously undergone a major change since the end of last quarter. The main reasons for this change are thought to be:</p>
<p>(1) British and American industrialists have different predictions about the post-war period.</p>
<p>(2) This opposition is reflected in the Washington political circles by the US Senate.</p>
<p>(3) The British's last struggle to organize a Western European group to ensure a European foothold in order to avoid American domination increases the American distrust of Britain.</p>
<p>In addition, the changes in the European political situation are also very obvious, which has resulted in the American First Doctrine's international conference diplomacy also being revised.</p>
<p>In fact, this series of conference diplomacy has been completely discredited because the Soviet Union has always refused to participate. How to evade the obligations arising from the decisions of each conference has become the trouble of the small anti-Axis countries below Britain. American diplomacy, which has suffered from a juvenile illness, has completely failed. In particular, the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance is a challenge from the Soviet Union and France to Dumbarton Oaks, so the US policy towards Europe has become more passive.</p>
<p>Britain Has Become a Supporting Role</p>
<p>So, what route will the United States' policy towards Europe take in the future? In terms of policy towards the Soviet Union, the so-called American "diplomatic counteroffensive" of launching a common British and American front in Europe has a certain degree of possibility. Rumor has it that Roosevelt will visit London soon, and this trip is not unrelated to the formation of a European group, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Soviet Union proposed a three-nation alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Britain in order to prevent the United States from gaining leadership in Europe and prevent Britain and France from forming an alliance, and to threaten Churchill with the terror of isolation.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy here is that there is a big difference between the British and American worries about the Soviet Union's diplomatic offensive, because the Soviet Union's influence on the United States is not as great as that of Britain, which is in a crisis of isolation. For this reason, when and how the United States, as the representative of the capitalist camp, will counterattack the Soviet Union's diplomatic offensive can be said to be a major event of concern this year. Therefore, the protagonists on the international stage this year will be the United States and the Soviet Union on the anti-Axis side, and Britain, like France, will become a secondary supporting role. This opposition between the anti-Axis camps will not be eliminated immediately even when the three-party summit is realized.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to how Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will try to shift the focus of this opposition to other issues. Generally speaking, the Japanese issue is likely to be valued by them, and it is not impossible to strengthen anti-Japanese propaganda. From this point of view, it is absolutely necessary for us to make a correct observation of the European issue.

<h3>Decisive Battle in the Philippines; A Blitz Lecture Meeting</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be held in Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – As the decisive battle in the Philippines intensifies, the Greater Asia Association Headquarters will hold a Philippine Decisive Battle Blitz Lecture Meeting at the Hibiya Public Hall here on February 3rd. This is to arouse the special attack spirit of the one hundred million citizens, encourage and motivate the Filipino people, and make a clear declaration of the inevitable victory in the Philippine decisive battle to both domestic and foreign audiences. The planned attendees and speakers include General Iwane Matsui, President of the Greater Asia Association Headquarters, and Vargas, the Philippine Ambassador to Japan, among others.</p>
<h3>Situation of US Bases in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch, US Republican House Representative Smith, who inspected the forward bases in the Pacific at the end of last year, recently returned and discussed the situation in that area on the 28th as follows: In December, I traveled to the battle center in the Pacific with the US troops on Leyte Island and returned before the landing operation on Luzon began. The primary issue in the Pacific War is the issue of troop strength and supplies. The US line of advance is very long. The island we visited was about 23 kilometers in length and had well-equipped facilities such as airfields, ship fuel supply depots, and searchlights. The task of the US soldiers stationed on these islands is to clear out the Japanese troops who are hiding in the hills and caves and conducting guerrilla warfare. I heard soldiers say that they are not only fighting hard against the Japanese troops in the dense forests under extreme heat, but also at risk of contracting tropical diseases.</p>
<h3>Surge in Gold Prices in the Capital; Authorities Investigate Secretly</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – In the past week, the market price of gold has risen sharply. There was a surge of 2,000 yuan per qian in one day, and the discovery of black market prices. Near Xin Jie Kou in the capital city, there are people openly buying at high prices. At a time when prices are soaring, the authorities intend to strictly prohibit such activity. The sudden rise in gold prices is enough to affect commodity prices and hinder the authorities' current policy implementation. The rise in gold prices is mainly due to the fact that speculators, aware of the authorities' determination to crack down on hoarding, have shifted their target to buying gold after selling off their goods with a large amount of floating capital. At the same time, as the situation in the Pacific theater becomes increasingly tense, ignorant citizens believe rumors and compete to buy gold, which is also a force contributing to the rise in prices. It is reported that the authorities believe that the sharp rise in gold prices has a significant impact on price stabilization efforts and are closely monitoring the situation. Those who engage in speculation and spread rumors will be severely punished once the investigation confirms their actions.</p>
<p>Discipline Committee to Begin Work</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Capital Commodity Price Stabilization Discipline Committee, after active preparations by the responsible personnel, has largely completed its internal organization. The Supervision Group is scheduled to begin work tomorrow (the 1st). The position of the leader of the Fuel Group has been decided to be held by Mayor Zhou of Nanjing, a member of the committee. The leader of the Military Law Group will be Zhang Qingze, the Director of the Military Law Department of the Ministry of the Army.</p>
<h3>Soviet Tank Forces Invade Brandenburg; German Troops Withdraw from Groz City</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to German frontline news: To avoid the heavy pressure from Soviet forces, German troops within Germany have withdrawn from the city of Kreuz (罗兹市), west of the border. This city is five kilometers west of the German border, located on the railway to Berlin, and is the intersection of the Stettin railway. It is 170 kilometers from the city to Berlin.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 29th that the street fighting in the city of Posen continued fiercely on the 28th. German defenders in the city of Schinhael, located seven kilometers inside Germany, have been stubbornly resisting the Soviet armored pressure on the city and are still fully securing it. Elsewhere, Soviet tank units on the Soviet Niekarwava side advanced to the west and northwest, reaching a point ten kilometers north of Groz (格羅茲市) on the 28th. Whether the Soviet forces will continue north from here, targeting Stettin, or advance west to attack the Berlin front is still unclear. However, judging from the continuous accumulation of reserve forces behind them, it can be inferred that the Soviet forces intend to advance fully to the west.</p>
<h3>German Authorities Issue Serious Warning to the People</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to German frontline news: The First Belorussian Front of the Soviet forces has finally broken through the German border and invaded Brandenburg, including the city of Berlin. On the 29th, Dr. Lei Ni (莱尼), the leader of the German Labor Front, issued a serious warning to the citizens of the entire city in view of the urgency of the situation, expressing a tragic determination: "Boasting of the history of German hands, but we will not allow the enemy to wantonly trample on our land, and we are determined to fight on the front of Berlin, to fight in the city of Berlin, and to fight behind Berlin," and so on. At the same time, the German authorities also stated that the front has finally reached the Brandenburg area, and in view of the seriousness of the situation, the 12th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule on January 30 will not be celebrated in any way. Regarding the countermeasures taken by the German army as described above, it is still difficult to speculate freely, but it can be asserted that it is not merely of a defensive nature, as commonly believed."</p>
<h3>12th Anniversary of Nazi Party Rule</h3>
<p>The Keihin Branch Holds a Commemoration</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The 30th is the 12th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The Tokyo and Yokohama Nazi Party branches gathered subordinates and Germans from the Keihin area this afternoon to hold a Nazi Party rule commemoration celebration at the Greater East Asia Hall here. Participants included German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer and his wife, German military attachés to Japan, and more than 500 others. Japanese participants included General Takao Suzuki, former Ambassador to Germany Mushanokoji, and other figures from various fields. Participants stood at attention during the German national anthem. Subsequently, the cadres of the Nazi Party branch reported on the current situation of the European front and the struggle of Germany. After that, the Japanese branch leader of the Nazi Party rose and expressed his determination that Germany would achieve final victory, and finally shouted "Heil Hitler!"</p>
<h3>Location of the Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting: Possibly in Rome</h3>
<p>Basel, 30th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: It is rumored that the anti-Axis Three-Power Conference will be held in Rome. It is claimed that President Roosevelt, accompanied by Secretary of State, Stettinius, and a large number of military, political, and economic personnel, has departed from the United States, and the Three-Power Conference may be held within a few days, and at the latest, no later than February 1st.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Increase Revenue; Improve Employee Benefits; Secretary-General Luo Talks to Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, met with Japanese reporters on the 29th and gave a speech on current municipal issues. The main points are as follows: (1) Regarding the reform and simplification of institutions, I started planning after taking office, and it has only recently been finalized. The general content has not yet reached the stage of publication. I plan to first implement the restructuring of personnel before the end of February. (2) The purpose of adjusting personnel is to eliminate redundant and incompetent personnel. However, it is also essential to allocate talents and leverage the capabilities of outstanding civil servants. (3) The treatment of outstanding officials should be improved. It is now planned to increase the treatment of police-related personnel by 30%, and general civil servants by 20%. As for the source of funds for this salary increase, after the Ministry of Finance approves, it is expected that the consumption special tax will be increased by 4% to 5%. In addition, a business tax will be levied on the first and eighth districts. It is estimated that tax revenue can be increased by 80 million yuan this year from April to May, and it is planned to use this to improve the treatment of employees.</p>
<p>Finance Bureau Plans to Revamp Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Since Luo, who is also the Director of the Finance Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality, actively rectified tax collection, various taxes have increased compared to before. It is now planned to follow the original plan of the Ministry of Finance, which will implement a business tax in the first district of the city (including the old eight districts). The tax rate is 10 per mille, calculated based on the total business volume of each store, factory, and company. According to estimates by the person in charge of the bureau, tax revenue can be increased by at least 100 million yuan per year. The bureau is also planning to revise the tax rate for the consumption special tax, from the original 4% to 5%. The tax rate for luxury consumption special tax is reduced from the original 30% to 15%. The reason for the reduced tax rate is that there were many cases of tax evasion in the past. After reducing the tax rate, tax evasion is absolutely prohibited. Regarding the banquet and hotel tax, the progressive tax levy in the past created opportunities for merchants to avoid taxes. In the future, it will be changed to a uniform tax rate of 20% to eliminate loopholes.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Accusation Cases; The Municipal Government Will Not Accept Them; Formal Submissions Must Be Prepared in the Future</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city has received repeated anonymous accusations. After investigation, most of them are fictitious or malicious slander. It has now been decided that in the future, if citizens accuse public officials under the Municipal Government, they should prepare a formal submission, obtain a shop guarantee, state their name, age, place of origin, occupation, and address, sign and seal it. If the name of a group is used, the seal of the group should be affixed, and the address of the group should be indicated, signed and sealed by the representative, and indicate their age, place of origin, and address. The Municipal Government will keep it strictly confidential, and anonymous documents will not be accepted. Citizens are advised to take note.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhou Meets with Foreign Press Corps</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou of this city met with a Chinese press corps on the previous day to express his political aspirations. This morning at 11:00, he also met with a Japanese press corps in the municipal conference room. This morning at the Huahua Hotel, he met with a foreign press corps and gave responsible answers to the questions raised by reporters from various countries.</p>
<h3>33rd Annual Profit Tax Collection Starts on March 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance organized a screening team on the 4th of this month to urge the collection of the 32nd annual Class A profit-making business income tax that has not been reported and paid by various companies, manufacturers, and businesses. The team was divided into five groups, each group dispatched two hired collectors, accompanied by two tax police officers, and went to various major companies, manufacturers, and money changers in various districts to screen, with a deadline of February 4th. The screening is about to be completed. The bureau has urged its subordinates to step up screening. After the screening period expires, if any businesses are found that have not declared and paid taxes, they will be ordered to suspend business in accordance with the law. It is reported that the bureau is actively handling various urging procedures for the 33rd annual Class A profit income tax, which will continue to be collected from March 1st. This year, the income tax collection will be declared and paid directly by each company, factory, business, and money changer in accordance with the law, to prevent the malpractice of apportionment and packaged payment by various industries.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Committee; Plans to Establish Various Shelters; Accommodate Street Children</h3>
<p>The current Winter Relief Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government is actively preparing to open several shelters in accordance with the planned relief plan to meet emergency needs. It has been learned that the committee's first shelter was established on the 28th of this month in the Huoshen Temple (火神庙) in Nanshi District. Cai Chunfang serves as the director, with a planned capacity of 300 people. Currently, it is less than half full, and the shelter is continuing to accept those in need until it reaches capacity. The address of the committee's second shelter is located at 1-3, Lane 949, Bailinan Road, Huxi. Director Zhu Weiru will open the shelter as soon as the allocated rice is received. The committee has also received a letter from the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, stating that in view of the current large number of street children who are crying and cold, it is truly pitiful. It is planned to first open a Poor Children's Shelter in Nanshi District and is looking for a suitable location to open it.</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year's End; Various Industries Rush to Complete Work; Money Shops Stop New Loans</h3>
<p>In view of the Lunar New Year approaching, the silver and money industries have begun to handle the final closing. During this final closing period, all money shops will stop new loans. For customers without contractual overdrafts, they must be fully repaid before the final closing period. In addition to stopping loans, all transactions in various industries are limited to cash. Previously issued customer accounts will be collected by designated personnel. At the same time, the Silver Union and the Money Bank will allow member money shops to apply for interbank lending in accordance with the interbank lending regulations, provided that reliable collateral is provided. However, the review of the purpose is very strict. The overall financial situation is still stable, and the Money Industry Association's interbank interest rate remains at six dimes and five cents.</p>
<h3>Municipal Material Allocation Office Holds Office Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Director Liu of the Municipal Material Allocation Office, believing that all material allocation work needs to be adjusted at the beginning of his tenure, and in order to promote future distribution policies in accordance with the Mayor's instructions, held the 11th Office Meeting yesterday (30th) afternoon at 2:00 PM. All senior staff members of Director Liu attended the discussion and reviewed the past and planned future distribution and unification matters.</p>
<h3>Post Office Cracks Down on Mail Carriers; Demanding Tips</h3>
<p>Post Office News: It has been found that mail carriers are demanding tips or holiday rewards, which violates postal regulations. The post office has always strictly prohibited this. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is feared that a few mail carriers will not restrain themselves. If anyone encounters the above situation, please note the date, the appearance of the mail carrier, and the number on their uniform, and send a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration for punishment.</p>
<h3>Authorities Hope that All Publications Will Automatically Rectify Content</h3>
<p>The development of the cultural publishing industry in this city is the best in the country, but the content of various publications often tends to be empty and boring, which not only wastes materials but also hinders the government's policy of rectifying thought. In order to understand the countermeasures of the Propaganda Department authorities, the reporter recently visited Minister Zhao at his private residence. According to him, he attaches considerable importance to this issue but advocates a guiding approach. He will hold a meeting with the cultural publishing circles in this city, solicit opinions, and hope that they will automatically rectify the content of their publications to conform to the grand purpose of the new Chinese ideological construction.</p>
<h3>Land and Property Registration for Absent Owners Deadline</h3>
<p>The Land and Property Management Committee of this city successively held housing and land registrations in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi districts last year. The Nanshi district registration was completed early. Few owners in the Huxi and Zhabei districts went to register. The committee originally scheduled to end the registration today (31st), but in consideration of the rights and interests of the owners, land and houses that have not been registered will not be taken over immediately. Other detailed measures will be discussed and announced later.</p>
<h3>Welfare Bureau Mediates Tea Industry Pay Raise Case</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau recently received a request from tea industry employees to resolve the issue of workers in the industry demanding improved treatment from employers. Because tea industry workers were threatened by life difficulties, they requested employers to improve treatment when the industry raised prices last December. However, the employers delayed the matter, and it has not been resolved to this day. The workers sincerely requested employers to accept the proposal to increase wages, but to no avail. To prevent the situation from becoming deadlocked, they requested the Welfare Bureau to mediate. The bureau has now accepted the request. It is hoped that in this autumn of high prices, the call for improved treatment can be heard everywhere. It is hoped that the authorities can mediate fairly and achieve a satisfactory resolution on the premise of mutual benefit between labor and management.</p>
