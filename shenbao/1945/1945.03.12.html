<h3 id="c1">貴族院昨開全體會議　日首相披瀝決意民　陸海相報告戰况確信必勝 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日貴院全體會議，十一日上午十時十分開會，首由德川議長介紹勅選之新議員，幷報吿因空襲宮側受穢晋宮恭請聖安之經過後，小磯首相登台，力陳敵軍茍來侵攻本土，則在登陸以前，使其片甲不留，政府正以此決意，期準備之萬全（演說要旨見另條）。繼由杉山陸相報吿呂宋島及硫黄島戰况，幷披瀝充分之自信謂，敵軍侵攻我本土，正是瓜達卡那爾島轉進以來，爲我求之不得之陸上決戰最好良機，政府具有斷然擊滅敵軍之信心。繼由米內海相說明關於敵機動部隊攻擊本土之戰况，陳述其撲滅驕敵於洋上之良機在即。述畢，於掌聲電動中下台。嗣議員提出質疑，由赤地濃氏質問政府之經綸，約歷一小時，繼之進入秘密會議，由松村·河幷·小原三氏質問政府之所信，至中午秘密會罷，即宣吿散會。</p>
<p>陸相報告　東京十一日中央社電　日本貴族院全體會議中，杉山陸相報吿戰况，其要旨如次：呂宋島方面，山下全團與海軍部隊，據守呂宋中央平原東北方之山岳地帶，克拉克地區西方之山地以及馬尼刺東方高地地帶之三大重要據點，與馬尼刺之守備部隊共同奮戰，以巧妙之攻守作戰，予敵巨創，以期日軍全般作戰有利展開，因此敵軍投入呂宋島之兵力，截止今日，已達十四五師幽，約二十萬，擊沉或擊毀敵艦船百餘艘，斃敵七萬，殲滅其上陸敵軍三分之一，山下大將卓越之統帥，與日軍將士之敢鬥，逐步達成作戰目的。同時，硫黄島之激戰，亦益趨熾烈，速日速夜因敵軍砲火之猛烈，全島已化歸焦土，變爲凄絕之戰塲，死守該島之日陸海軍將士，渾然一體，繼續奮戰，長七公里半，寬四公里之孤島，敵已投下兵力達三師團，四萬有餘，其損害已越二萬，陸軍亦與海軍同心協力，銳意於作戰準備。敵倘進兵本土，即以特攻飛機及各種新兵器拚擊敵艦船，縱使敵軍得以上陸，仍必實行陸上決戰，有斷然殲滅敵軍之確信。今敵軍急於早日結束戰爭，不擇手段，空襲亦益加激烈，尤其九日晚盲炸帝都，實爲人神所不容，勝利須貫澈到底，此乃東西一致之鐵則。於皇威之下，一億國民與軍隊之必勝方策呼應，茍能發揮護國之熱誠，克服任何空襲與難局，團結一致，則可確信皇國必勝也。</p>
<p>海相報告　東京十一日中央社電　日米內海相十一日在貴·衆全院本會議席上，表明其海軍之決意，略謂，日本帝國海軍與陸軍渾然一體，良機一到，必於軍均具此確信，其要旨如下：敵B29型飛機，頻繁來襲，周時敵機動部隊亦於二月中旬以來，三次來襲本土，我方每次均予敵相當損害，但對敵艦艇不克予以致命打擊，實屬憾事。當時我方監於諸般情勢，對萬難隱忍者，亦已隱忍矣，惟帝國海軍發揮現在所强調指出者，與帝國陸軍緊密合作，運然一體之效果，機會一至，對驕慢之敵，必能於每上捕捉殲滅之，帝國海軍均具此確信，全軍士氣旺盛壯烈。</p>
<h3 id="c2">小磯首相演說要旨 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　小磯內閣總理大臣演說要旨如下：</p>
<p>越南當局不表誠意</p>
<p>茲先就日本政府對法履印度支那所採之措置，加以說明，按印度支那在地勢上，對於東亞之靜謐及日本之安危，皆有重大關係，日·法兩國政府，爲共同防衛印度支那，曾作軍事之協力。大東亞戰爭爆發後，東亞之情勢，變革甚劇，日本政府尊軍與維希政府締結之約定，即在去年八月，法本國軍事。政治情勢緊急之際，亦仍然與印度支那之法方官憲及軍隊相互協力，而共同防衛該地。惟越南當局竟隨情勢之變轉，而隨時變更其態度，其與日本之關係，表面上雖標榜友好協力，而暗地却逐漸採取積極不協力之態度，尤堪忿恨者，彼等竟敢祈念美勢力早日再度壓制東亞，而且積極試行與本國之反軸心分子秘密連繫。反而再觀東亞之戰局，敵美業對印度支那屢次加以攻擊，至於何時正式侵寇該地，頗難推測。立於此種情勢急迫中之日本，曾命現在之日本代表，屢與越南官憲交涉，共同防衛發生實效之措置，詎越南當局幷不表示任何誠意，而且試取消極抵抗之態度，於是，日政府確認事態不許再行遷延，又於三月九日命駐越南之松本大使，促德古總督最後反省。</p>
<p>對原住民全面支援</p>
<p>周時，並要求對於印度支那共同防衛之協力增強事項，有一具體之措置，然越南當局則設辭拒絕。至此，日本對於目前之勁敵，自不得不實行單獨之印度支那防衛，日軍爲排除敵對日軍之官憲，始取軍事上必要之最少限度之措置，然而日本除絕對尊重安南國·東浦塞國·琅勃刺邦國等固有之制度外，對於欲除去美英侵略東亞勢力，以防衛其鄉土之原住民，更不惜盡一切援助，如此相互協力，以期在美·英等攻擊中，完成印度支那之防衛。日本對於印度支那無領土之企圖，而且暫時在取前述暫定措置之同時，並有決意使大東亞共同宣言實現於印度支那。在排除侵略印度支那之勢力時，久受彈壓之安南等民族，呼　民族獨立之聲明勢必澎湃，而興日本對於彼等之此種要望，欲予以全面之支援。又對於法蘭西常作印度支那之一部而統治之廣州灣，其侵略勢力業已洗除盡凈，而恢復其本來姿態，國民政府如收囘此地，而行使自主行政之時，日政府已有同意之準備。</p>
<p>日軍將兵固守堅壘</p>
<p>其次，刻下戰局極其重大之侵攻，日益熾烈，對於呂宋島·硫黃島不顧損害，唯恃癮大之物量猛衝，來攻之敵軍，日軍將兵在困難狀况下，固守堅壘，燃起軒昻之動意，奮鬥猛攻，且予敵軍以甚大損害。馬里亞納島之敵，逐次加强航空兵力，對於日本本土之空襲頓形激烈，此外，敵機動部隊時出沒於日本近海，以艦載機攻擊本土，已不容輕視，暴虐無饜之敵，屢次殺傷無辜之同胞，並破壞民房·學校·病院·廟宇寺。戰局之前途，固不容輕輕豫斷，然而徵諸從來仗恃物最優勢，繼續奔放進攻軍作戰指導方式，則甚至必須覺悟到將有急欲戰事短期結束之敵軍。於最近將來，以我本土爲目標，而一直豕突狼奔而來之事態發生，如果一旦皇土化作戰塲，則使敵一蹶不振之良機，正在此秋。太平洋各島上陸作戰時，雖擁有優勢兵力，而仍須備嘗苦辛，已爲美所身經，何况敵軍長驅侵寇我本土，縱如何努力輸送兵員物量，而我本土決戰之整備嚴密完整，斷不容敵美覬覦。</p>
<p>地利人和敵來必殲</p>
<p>然敵軍茍來我近海，則我唯有在海上將其擊耳，敵軍苟企岡登陸，則我唯有在水際將其擊落海中耳，設使敵軍終于登陸而來，則我亦唯有于鐵槌下將其澈底摧毀耳。要之，邀擊敵軍之戰塲，悉爲我鄕土，得地之利，而協同軍方從事防衛者，悉爲我一億同胞，得人之和，我一億同胞，悉由於兵農一體之國是中，能發揮總力抗敵之利益，而且觀夫皇軍傳統之統帥妙用，與日本將兵護衛皇國之壯志，則確信將來于本土周邊作戰之際，必能將敵殲滅，使之不得踏進本土一步。試依作戰用兵之觀點言之，陸海一體之作戰，至斯時始能發揮富於構想之作戰，屆時確信日軍必能把握決戰之神機。政府當局以此非常事態爲前提，爲與作戰相呼應，統帥與其完全吻合之邀敵決戰措置，茲更表明凝結國家總力于勝利一點，對于諸種施策，則以迅速毅然之決意，銳意推行，値此緊急之秋，一億同胞，亦須再度覺悟，鞏固必勝之信念，不畏艱勤因苦，希望各位爲護衛國體與國土，而一貫奮鬥。大東亞各國家，各民族，亦須爲保衛東亞及復興東亞，而與日本堅實提携，爲摧毀暴虐之敵而挺身，吾等對于大東亞各國家，各民族之此稱獻身之努力，衷心表示敬意。</p>

<h3 id="c3">實現國父遺志　紀念國父逝世二十周年 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>今天是國父逝世二十周年紀念日，二十年前的今天，國父溘然長逝，將建國救國的重任，留在全國同胞同志的肩頭。回想當日驟失領袖，眞有無窮的悲痛</p>
<p>國父在民國十三年十一月底，亦即是逝世前五個月，對神戶五團體演說時，即指出中日兩大民族將來必定團結，說：「東亞最大民族，是中國與日本，中日現在還沒有大聯絡，將來潮流所趨，我們東亞各民族一定要聯絡的。」同日的歡迎會上，又對日本人士，希望協助我國廢除不平等條約，説：「日本現在是東亞最強的國家，一個獨立國家和殖民地親善，這是做不到的事。若是日本眞有誠意和中國親善，便先幫助中國廢除不平等條約，爭回主人地位，讓中國人得到自由身份。」在國父逝世後二十年的今日，盟邦日本果然不負所托，協助我們收回了租界，取消了不平等條約，中日果能團結一致，協力爲東亞的光榮與自由而奮鬥。</p>
<p>在二十年前，國父會指出道一戰爭發生的必然性，說：「要請歐洲人和平退回我們的權利，像與虎謀皮，一定做不到，要收回權利，便要訴諸武力。」又斥責一般悲觀論者，說他們錯認「歐洲的文化科學進步，工業精良，以爲亞洲一定不能抵抗歐洲，不能臉離歐洲的壓迫，永遠做歐洲奴隸。」並指出東亞民族在這一戰爭中必得勝利說：「日本老早有了完備的武力，我們中國人數有四萬萬，向來雖愛和平，但在生死關頭，當然也要奮鬥，如果亞洲民族全聯合起來，去和歐洲人講武，一定有勝無敗。」</p>
<p>國父當日在發動斛除歐洲人壓迫的戰爭一前提之下，提出了「大亞洲主義」，對於這主義，國父說：「我們的大亞洲主義，用甚麽做基礎呢？應該用我們固有的文化做基礎，要請道德和仁義。」又說：「東方的文化是王道，西方的文化是覇道，講王道是主張仁義道德，是用正義公理來感化人，講覇道是主張功利强權，用洋槍大砲來壓迫人。」</p>
<p>在今日紀念國父逝世，唯有實現國父遺志，循遵國父指出的道路走去，如今解放東亞民族的鬥爭，已臨最後關頭，我中日兩國國民，必須體會國父倡導的大亞洲主義的眞諦，一致努力。</p>
<p>今天又是植樹節，所以選擇國父逝世之日爲植樹節者，其意義更爲深遠。目前中國在實際上仍然是重農業國家，農民人口佔全國總人口的最大比數，而造林護林，興修水利，尤爲協助農業生產的必要工作。所以我們逢此節日，從植樹運動而推及農業增產，更感到十分的迫切，可是，近年因爲交通運輸的阻滯，木材產地則有過剩而任之蹧蹋的現象。非木材產地因取作燃料，園林墓樹均採斫以盡，這種現象，實爲提倡植樹運動的障礙。希望建設部主管當局首先頒令保護禁斫，同時，獎勵植樹。如果僅逢植樹節日，紀念鼓吹，而不從實際上保護林木獎勵培植，那末，不但未能收樹木增產之效，反必使樹木日益減少，決不是國父重視造林增加農產之期望，願當局三注意之。</p>

<p>北平十日中央社電　此次日本對越南採取非常措置後，日當局對華北法人殘存各機關，亦於十日施以適當措置，楠木公使並發表談話謂、華北法僑，並無利敵行爲，故決尊軍其生命財產。</p>

<p>西貢十一日中央社電　松本·德古會談決裂之瞬間，日軍當局立即採取必要措置，將德古總督及陸海空軍司令官等要人一舉拘禁，此間雖有小部分之抵抗，然北部·中部·南部各地之日軍，在一小時至數小時內，將必要措置辦理完全吿竣。十日晨起，印度支那在極平靜中邁出新生之第一步，至此，日本帝國將與原住民政府共同增强印度支那之防衛體制，因日軍此次之處置，在越南積年苛政下之原住民，驟然破涕爲笑，一對待謳歌印度支對了之黎明在即，日本帝國業已聲明對彼等之獨立運動不惜一切援助，是故彼等極爲感激，誓死挺身協力日本之聲浪，充滿街巷，尤以舊越南軍所屬之原住民將兵，企望早日受日軍司令官之指揮。</p>

<p>呂宋前綫十一日中央社電　呂宋島敵軍，一面以主力指向日軍馬尼刺東方據點，一面以一師兵力對北部呂宋連結於聖尼哥拉斯，聖霍塞東方高地間之日軍堅壘綫，企圖加以攻擊，其主力逐漸集結於聖霍塞東北約十公里少卡朗格朗方面。又反覆攻擊聖尼哥拉斯東北方日軍陣地之敵，七日約有砲兵二中隊進出於聖尼哥拉斯東北約七公里之綫，北方面之日軍，隨處奮戰中，或以砲兵集中射擊，或以突擊戰術，使敵付重大之代價。只聖霍塞班班道路方面，本月六·七兩日予敵之損害爲殺傷敵兵三百名。又聖尼哥拉斯地區之戰鬥，日軍截至二月末，所收獲之綜合戰果，計殺傷敵兵五百名以上，破壞十米厘諷砲二，步兵砲二，速射砲二，重機關槍六，汽車二，鹵獲迫擊砲四，輕機關槍六，自動步槍九，通信機二。</p>

<p>廿年過程言之痛心　各位周胞，國父逝世到今天恰恰是二十週年紀念，中國在這二十年的過程中，外受英美帝國主義的擾亂，和平的歲月以及統一的局面，只是曇花一現的忽忽渡過了。我們在這二十年裏的體騐中，得到了一個結論，就是：一天不解脫帝國主義的束縛，國家就是一天得不到獨立自由，一天不消滅中國共產黨的擾亂，國家是一天得不到和平統一，也就是國家還沒脫出險境，民族還沒脫出危機。這種體騐和認識，凡是爲國家民族打算的同胞們都有，而我們之所以能有這種體騐和認識，是因爲國父給我們留下了偉大的三民主義與建國方略在激發着，我們外求强力自由，內求和平統一的運動。</p>
<p>五載奮　所獲成就　這個運動，就是五年來我們所努力的和平反共建國運動，和平運動是遵奉國父遺教所昭示給我們應負的任務，向前邁進，所以國父遺敎是和平運動的最高理念，而和平運動則是國民革命運動的之出發，是爭取外獲獨立自由，內獲和平統一之工作的主流。我們在汪故主席領導之下，奮鬥了五年，竟獲得了國父畢生致力革命未竟的偉大成就，國父所詔示的「中日兩國只宜爲友，不宜爲敵」以及「廢除不平等條約」的主張，都次第實現，這都是遵奉國父遺敎而漸致的偉大成就。只要對內趕快做到和平統一，對外獨立自由是不成問題的，可是我講到這裏，就感覺到一種沉痛，我們眼看着國父遺敎已經遂步的實現了，眞不幸得很，在故主席又捨黨國而長逝，沒能看中國的完全獨立自由及和平統一</p>
<p>基本政策始終不變　陳代主席以追隨國父在黨國奮鬥多年的經歷，繼承在主席遺志，領導黨國，在全國上下一致的擁戴中，向「內求和平統一，外求獨立自由」的偉大目標邁進。我們今天紀念國父，要知道「內求和平統一，外求獨立自由」是國父和在故主席畢生革命奮鬥的一貫精神，同時也是今後中國在陳代主席領導之下的基本政策，而且必須先完成和平統一，才能實現獨立自由，這在國父北上的北伐之役，我們就可以知道。「內求和平統一」是「外求獨立自由」的先決問題，爲了針對這個問題，繼續努力，所以汪故主席才領導和平運動，陳代主席恪遵汪故主席的遺志，就是在貫澈這個問題。</p>
<p>希望同胞一致努力　我們看到目前的國際形勢和大東亞戰爭的進行，就會感覺這個問題已經比國父北上和北伐的時候嚴重多了，因爲那個時候，戰亂的作用是只能障得國家的建設，只能消耗民族的元氣，但是在當前的這個關頭，竟是國家存亡民族興廢所繫，實在是不能稍爲漠視的。所以陳代主席在本年元且曾經凱切的訓示給我們說；「中國危機現正四伏，茍不努力，或則淪爲決戰之戰塲，或則淪爲全面之赤化，或則淪爲英美之殖民地」，足見和平統一這個問題，是當前的急務了，我希望全國同胞認爲促成和平統一是時代使命，即時奮起一致努力。（未完）</p>

<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社訊：萊因河東岸美軍橋頭堡之戰，已益見熾烈，美第一軍由戰鬥機數百架掩護，以生力軍及坦克隊渡渡萊瑪根（Remagen)之鐵橋，德軍正在反攻中。萊瑪根以北數公里處之霍尼夫（Honnef）美軍於星期五夜渡河侵入該城，並向北推進，美軍先被逐出城外，旋經增援，乃重侵入霍尼夫城，現在巷戰中。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社訊：西線戰事最重要者，爲萊因河東岸萊瑪根對岸美軍橋頭之擴大，英加軍突破桑坦區未逞。美軍於通過波恩後，已進抵萊因河西岸，霍格斯將軍之部隊雖遭德軍集中砲轟，仍在萊瑪根對岸向北進展，業已抵達霍尼夫，故美軍橋頭現已擴大至南自林資，北至霍尼夫，波恩城現正在巷戰中。</p>

<p>最近本市有一小部份市民，利用短波收音機，收聽敵方消息，並轉輾相傳，發生種種謠言，散佈街頭巷尾，其中頗多以敵國宣傳性廣播誤解，致離事實更遠。茲悉本市當局有鑒及此，特重申嚴厲取締七燈以上高級收音機及短波收音機，如有違者定當嚴厲處罰，故市民中備有該項收音機者應從速自動獻繳當局。</p>

<p>本市各業同業公會之組織，向依「工商同業公會法」，由同業行號七家以上之發起，呈准主管機關後設立，總數在二百單位以上，迨後當局另頒「工商同業公會暫行條例」，凡同業公會之組設，皆須依照是項條例。最近市經濟局復擬澈底調整各業公會組織機構，凡性質雷同者，或予裁撤，或行歸併，刻正在積極進行中。</p>
<p>市經濟局訓令　市經濟局訓令各業公會云：「查本市各業同業公會辦理情形，頗不一致，其組織健全者，固屬甚多，而會務廢弛，形同虛設者，亦復不少。本局長抱整頓本市經濟機構之決心，對於業務性質雷同，辦理不善。及會務鬆懈之各公會，即將加以合併整理，以期强化各業同業組織，俾易達到協助政府推行經濟政策之使命。」並限於三日內造報調查表。至於各業公司商號，無論其營業性質如何，均應加入各該同業公會爲會員，繳納會費，及遵照公會章程買賣，如敢故意觀望，拒不加入公會者，將來一經查出，即由該會呈報主管機關，依法懲處，或吊銷營業執照。查各公司行號，應加入公會一節，關係黨局曾三令五申，旨在杜絕非法買賣，及强化戰時經濟體制。</p>

<p>今（十二）日爲總理逝世紀念日，除市府及所屬各機關會集舉行紀念儀式外，本市各銀行錢莊及證交市塲均休業停市一天，全市各業商號均懸旗誌哀。</p>
<h3 id="c21">粉麥統制委員會　最近工作槪要　續借保藏資金 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>本會於上年七月間，與中日雙方銀團成立貸款六十萬萬元，計收買資金及保藏資金各三十萬萬元，經呈奉行政院令行財政部予以保證。收買資金係充收麥預支款項，貸由指定收買商以本票貼現向銀行借用。保藏資金則係將所收麥類加工製粉後，關於輸移出並配給等費用以及保藏資材必需之用。計自新麥登塲以來，收買工作展開，前項資金即經陸續用罄，加之其後物價變動甚劇，須以現款收買爲主，而委托工塲製粉，又受運輸及電力限制，未能迅速出貨，致資金回轉遲延，因此再與關係方面洽商，復於十一月間向中日銀團續借保藏資金三十萬萬元，仍由中日雙方銀團各半分任。亦經呈報行政院令行財部追加保證，與前次六十萬萬元貸款，一例支用。</p>
<p>試辦行政收買</p>
<p>在本届收買麥類之初，對於收買價格，本會曾極力加以抑平，幸得各關係當局之協助，進行尙稱順利。乃其後各地農產物價日見昇　，麥價因之上漲甚钜，如照市價收購，則恐影響米糧及其他農產物價。爲確保民食軍需別　補救法辦計，爰參照米糧行政收買方式，暫在蘇省區內試行。在有關行政機關協助之下，將麥類與米糧保持聯繫，併行收購，由會指派收買商，給予收買證書，使赴產麥地區實施直接收買工作，俾與市塲隔絕，藉免居奇操縱。亦經呈准行政院，令行江蘇省政府，飭屬一體遵照，協助辦理。</p>
<p>調整配給價格</p>
<p>本屆收買小麥，係照新定價格，製粉成本自須加高，所有各地粉麩配給價格，曾予重行核定。但入秋以後，小麥收買價以及運輸製造包裝等各項費用，無不繼長增高，對於前訂粉麩價格，又不適用。迭經與各關係方面詳加商硏，僉認爲應有重行調整之必要，庶期牧支保持平衡，生產仍得繼續。爰自上年十二月份起，將各地區粉麩配給價格，一律依照新案辦理，經製成成本計算表，分報商統會及行政院備案。</p>
<p>收購熶部存粉</p>
<p>自前糧食部裁併後，所屬米糧採銷總管理處，即成立淸理委員會，由實業部接管。關於前糧食部在京蘇各地所存麵粉，均商由本會照公定價格，予以收買。計京地存粉一四·五八〇袋，蘇州·無錫兩地存粉二·四人七袋，均經飭由本會各辦事處與淸理委員會原保管人，照數移交，點收淸楚。所有應付價款，業于本年一月間清付。</p>
<p>任統配處理事</p>
<p>上海區粉麩統配處自卅二年十二月一日成立，迄至上年十一月底止，一年任期，業已顧滿。本會以該處一年來辦理統配業務，成績尙稱滿意，正副理事長及各理監事，均能勝任愉快，爰仍函請該處理事長楊鏡澄，副理事長小坂幸一，理事尙友聲藤田一郞等，繼續擔任，期收駕輕馭熟之效。</p>
<p>擬訂運管條例</p>
<p>本會奉命辦理粉麥統制，前經擬定收買。製造及加工·配給·移動。取締等暫行辦法，呈奉行政院核准遵辦。惟前項辦法實施以來，對于收買移動項，尙嫌未盡周密，爲更謀强化統制工作，嚴防囤積走漏起見，經擬製粉麥運銷管理條例施行細則，呈報行政院核示，業已由院提出二四一次會議修正通過，並呈由最高國防會議第六五次會通過，由院令公佈施行</p>

<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週更趨穩定，人心殊爲振奮，交易已歸趨正常，物價續見平低，烚赤漲跌互見，終在五十關上下週旋，惟購進仍佔多數。紋銀無變化，公債出入甚微，華股上半週疲勢雖强，但至下半週因消息利多，買風突起，股市因而重見高峯。大都游資均傾向烚赤與華股活動，如能在正常札道交易，固爲金融繁榮之好現象。工業商各業一時難望生色，如運輸交通能恢復相當時期，生產原料與動力燃料，能充分供劑，當爲工商復活之時機。幸最近有關各當局，積極謀恢復交通運輸，鉅量民生必需物資，不久即將輸運抵滬，且天氣漸趨和暖，土產物產抗日增，來源可繼續不斷，民需日用品可能充分調劑，是以人心安定，持貨者紛紛脫售，因而物價繼見平落，米·雜糧，蔬菜·鮮肉及日用品均趨下隆。凡市經濟局前核定之主要商品新限價，已適合各門市買賣之水準，如當局能持久執行取締投機商非法買賣，物價當不致再見高漲。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The House of Peers Held a Plenary Session Yesterday: The Japanese Prime Minister Elaborated on His Determination; The Army and Navy Ministers Reported on the War Situation, Confident of Victory <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:10 AM on the 11th. First, Speaker Tokugawa introduced the newly appointed members chosen by Imperial Order and reported on the circumstances of the Imperial Palace being defiled by an air raid and the request for the Emperor's well-being. Then, Prime Minister Koiso took the stage and emphatically stated that should the enemy dare to invade the homeland, they would be completely annihilated before landing. The government is determined to ensure thorough preparation (the gist of the speech is in another article). Next, Army Minister Sugiyama reported on the war situation in Luzon and Iwo Jima, expressing full confidence, stating that the enemy's invasion of the homeland is the best opportunity for a decisive land battle, something they have been seeking since the retreat from Guadalcanal. The government has the confidence to resolutely destroy the enemy. Subsequently, Navy Minister Yonai explained the war situation regarding the enemy's mobile fleet attacking the homeland, stating that the opportune moment to eradicate the arrogant enemy on the ocean is imminent. After the presentation, he stepped down amidst thunderous applause. Afterwards, members raised questions, with Mr. Akachi questioning the government's financial policies for approximately one hour. This was followed by a closed session, where Mr. Matsumura, Mr. Kawai, and Mr. Ohara questioned the government's beliefs. The closed session adjourned at noon, and the meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Army Minister's Report Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - During the plenary session of the Japanese House of Peers, Army Minister Sugiyama reported on the war situation, the gist of which is as follows: In Luzon, General Yamashita's entire force, along with naval units, are defending three major strongholds: the mountainous areas northeast of the central Luzon plain, the mountains west of the Clark area, and the highlands east of Manila. Together with the garrison forces in Manila, they are fighting fiercely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy through skillful offensive and defensive operations, aiming for a favorable overall Japanese war effort. To date, the enemy has committed fourteen or fifteen divisions, approximately 200,000 troops, to Luzon. Over one hundred enemy ships have been sunk or destroyed, and 70,000 enemy soldiers have been killed, annihilating one-third of the landed enemy forces. General Yamashita's outstanding leadership and the bravery of the Japanese soldiers are gradually achieving the operational objectives. Meanwhile, the fierce battle on Iwo Jima is intensifying. Due to the enemy's intense artillery fire day and night, the entire island has been turned into scorched earth, becoming a desolate battlefield. The Japanese army and navy soldiers defending the island are united as one and continue to fight valiantly. On this isolated island, seven and a half kilometers long and four kilometers wide, the enemy has deployed three divisions, over 40,000 troops, and their losses have exceeded 20,000. The army and navy are also cooperating closely, diligently preparing for battle. If the enemy advances to the homeland, they will be met with special attack aircraft and various new weapons targeting their ships. Even if the enemy manages to land, a land battle will be waged, with firm confidence in decisively annihilating the enemy. Now, the enemy is eager to end the war quickly and is resorting to any means, with increasingly fierce air raids. The indiscriminate bombing of the capital on the evening of the 9th is particularly intolerable to both humans and gods. Victory must be achieved at all costs; this is the unwavering principle shared by the entire nation. Under the Emperor's authority, the 100 million citizens and the military must respond with strategies for certain victory. By displaying patriotic fervor and overcoming any air raid and hardship, and by uniting as one, we can be certain that the Empire will be victorious.</p>
<p>Navy Minister's Report Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Navy Minister Yonai stated his navy's determination at the plenary session of both houses of the Diet on the 11th. He briefly stated that the Japanese Imperial Navy and the Army are united as one and that everyone in the military is certain that when the right opportunity arises, they will strike. The main points are as follows: Enemy B-29 aircraft have been frequently attacking. Furthermore, enemy mobile forces have attacked the homeland three times since mid-February. Each time, the enemy has suffered considerable damage, but it is regrettable that our forces have not been able to inflict fatal blows on enemy ships. At that time, considering various circumstances, we have endured what was difficult to endure. However, the Imperial Navy, emphasizing its close cooperation with the Imperial Army, is confident that when the opportunity arises, it will be able to capture and annihilate the arrogant enemy at every attempt. The Imperial Navy has this confidence, and the morale of the entire force is high and heroic.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Key Points of Prime Minister Koiso's Speech <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The key points of Prime Minister Koiso's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Authorities Lack Sincerity</p>
<p>First, I will explain the measures taken by the Japanese government regarding French Indochina. Indochina's geographical location is of great importance to the peace of East Asia and the safety of Japan. The Japanese and French governments had military cooperation for the joint defense of Indochina. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in East Asia changed dramatically. The Japanese government respected the agreement concluded with the Vichy government and continued to cooperate with the French authorities and military in Indochina to jointly defend the region, even when the military and political situation in France became critical in August of last year. However, the Vietnamese authorities changed their attitude according to the changing situation. Although they superficially claimed friendship and cooperation with Japan, they secretly adopted an increasingly uncooperative attitude. What is even more infuriating is that they dared to pray for the early return of American forces to suppress East Asia and actively attempted to secretly connect with anti-Axis elements in their country. On the other hand, considering the war situation in East Asia, the enemy Americans have repeatedly attacked Indochina, and it is difficult to predict when they will formally invade the region. In this urgent situation, Japan instructed its representative in Vietnam to repeatedly negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities to implement effective measures for joint defense. However, the Vietnamese authorities showed no sincerity and tried to resist passively. Therefore, the Japanese government confirmed that the situation could not be delayed any longer and instructed Ambassador Matsumoto in Vietnam on March 9 to urge Governor-General Decoux to reconsider.</p>
<p>Full Support for the Indigenous People</p>
<p>At the same time, Japan requested concrete measures to strengthen cooperation in the joint defense of Indochina, but the Vietnamese authorities refused with excuses. At this point, Japan had no choice but to independently defend Indochina against the current powerful enemy. The Japanese military took the minimum necessary military measures to remove officials hostile to the Japanese military. However, Japan, in addition to absolutely respecting the inherent systems of Annam, Tonkin, and Laos, is willing to provide all possible assistance to the indigenous people who want to eliminate American and British aggression in East Asia and defend their homeland. Through such mutual cooperation, we aim to complete the defense of Indochina against attacks from the US and Britain. Japan has no territorial ambitions in Indochina and intends to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration in Indochina while taking the aforementioned provisional measures. When the forces invading Indochina are eliminated, the oppressed peoples of Annam and other nations will inevitably raise their voices for national independence, and Japan is willing to provide full support for these demands. Furthermore, the Guangzhou Bay, which France had always ruled as part of Indochina, has been cleansed of its invasive forces and restored to its original state. The Japanese government is prepared to agree when the National Government recovers this territory and exercises its autonomous administration.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Firmly Defending Strongholds</p>
<p>Next, the current war situation is extremely critical, and the attacks are becoming increasingly fierce. On Luzon and Iwo Jima, the enemy forces, disregarding losses and relying on their overwhelming material strength, are launching fierce attacks. Japanese soldiers are firmly defending their strongholds under difficult conditions, displaying great determination and launching fierce counterattacks, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. The enemy on the Mariana Islands is gradually strengthening its air power, intensifying air raids on the Japanese homeland. In addition, enemy mobile forces are frequently appearing in Japanese waters, attacking the homeland with carrier-based aircraft, which cannot be ignored. The tyrannical and insatiable enemy has repeatedly injured and killed innocent civilians, destroying homes, schools, hospitals, and temples. The future of the war situation cannot be lightly predicted. However, considering the enemy's previous operational guidance, which relies on overwhelming material superiority and continuous relentless attacks, we must be aware that the enemy may be eager to end the war quickly. In the near future, a situation may arise where the enemy rushes towards our homeland with the aim of attacking. If our Imperial soil becomes a battlefield, it will be a great opportunity to make the enemy stumble. The Americans have already experienced the difficulties of landing operations on Pacific islands, even with superior forces. Furthermore, if the enemy invades our homeland, no matter how hard they try to transport troops and supplies, the preparation for the decisive battle on our homeland is so thorough and complete that the enemy Americans will not be able to covet it.</p>
<p>Advantageous Terrain and Harmony; The Enemy Will Surely Be Annihilated Upon Arrival</p>
<p>However, if the enemy comes near our waters, we must strike them at sea. If the enemy attempts to land, we must shoot them down into the sea at the water's edge. If the enemy eventually lands, we must thoroughly crush them with our hammers. In short, the battlefields for intercepting the enemy are all in our homeland, giving us the advantage of terrain. And all of our 100 million compatriots are engaged in defense in cooperation with the military, giving us the harmony of people. Our 100 million compatriots, based on the national policy of integrating the military and agriculture, can exert the benefits of total war against the enemy. Furthermore, considering the traditional leadership skills of the Imperial Army and the determination of Japanese soldiers to protect the Imperial nation, we are confident that we will be able to annihilate the enemy in the upcoming operations around the homeland, preventing them from setting foot on our soil. From the perspective of operations and tactics, the integrated land and sea operations can unleash imaginative tactics at this time. We are confident that the Japanese military will be able to seize the divine opportunity for a decisive battle. The government is taking this extraordinary situation as a premise, and in order to correspond with the operations, the interception and decisive battle measures that completely match the command are being taken. Now, I further state that we will condense the nation's total strength on the point of victory, and with swift and resolute determination, we will vigorously promote various policies. In this emergency, our 100 million compatriots must also re-awaken, solidify their belief in certain victory, and not fear hardship. I hope everyone will consistently strive to protect the national polity and territory. The countries and peoples of the Greater East Asia must also firmly cooperate with Japan to protect and revive East Asia, and stand up to destroy the tyrannical enemy. We express our heartfelt respect for the dedicated efforts of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy: Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. Twenty years ago today, Dr. Sun Yat-sen suddenly passed away, leaving the heavy responsibility of building and saving the nation on the shoulders of comrades across the country. Recalling the sudden loss of our leader on that day, there was truly endless sorrow.</p>
<p>At the end of November 1924, five months before his death, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in a speech to five groups in Kobe, pointed out that the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan would surely unite in the future, saying, "The largest ethnic groups in East Asia are China and Japan. China and Japan have not yet had major contacts, but the trend of the future is that the ethnic groups in East Asia must unite." At the welcoming party on the same day, he also hoped that the Japanese would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties, saying, "Japan is now the strongest country in East Asia. It is impossible for an independent country to be friendly with a colony. If Japan is sincere in being friendly with China, it should first help China abolish the unequal treaties and regain its master status, allowing the Chinese people to obtain free status." Twenty years after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, our allied nation Japan has indeed lived up to expectations, assisting us in recovering the concessions and abolishing the unequal treaties. China and Japan can indeed unite and work together for the glory and freedom of East Asia.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out the inevitability of a war, saying, "To ask the Europeans to peacefully return our rights is like seeking skin from a tiger. It is impossible. To recover our rights, we must resort to force." He also rebuked the general pessimists, saying that they mistakenly believed that "European culture, science, and industry are advanced, and that Asia can never resist Europe, can never escape European oppression, and will forever be slaves to Europe." He pointed out that the East Asian ethnic groups would surely win in this war, saying, "Japan has long had complete military strength. Although our China has a population of 400 million and has always loved peace, it will certainly fight at the critical moment of life and death. If all the Asian ethnic groups unite and speak of military force with the Europeans, they will surely win without defeat."</p>
<p>Under the premise of launching a war to eliminate European oppression, Dr. Sun Yat-sen proposed "Pan-Asianism." Regarding this doctrine, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "What should we use as the foundation of our Pan-Asianism? We should use our inherent culture as the foundation, and we must advocate morality, benevolence, and righteousness." He also said, "Eastern culture is the way of kings, and Western culture is the way of hegemons. The way of kings advocates benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and uses justice and reason to influence people. The way of hegemons advocates utilitarianism, power, and uses guns and cannons to oppress people."</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we can only realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and follow the path pointed out by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Now, the struggle to liberate the ethnic groups of East Asia is nearing its final stage. The people of China and Japan must understand the true meaning of the Pan-Asianism advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and work together.</p>
<p>Today is also Arbor Day. The choice of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death anniversary as Arbor Day has profound significance. At present, China is still in practice mainly an agricultural country. The farmer population accounts for the largest percentage of the total population, and afforestation, forest protection, and water conservancy construction are necessary work to assist agricultural production. Therefore, on this holiday, we feel very urgently the promotion of agricultural production from the tree planting movement. However, in recent years, due to the obstruction of transportation, the timber production areas have a surplus and allow it to be ruined. In non-timber production areas, because the trees are taken for fuel, the garden and tomb trees are all cut down. This phenomenon is indeed an obstacle to promoting the tree planting movement. It is hoped that the competent authorities of the Ministry of Construction will first issue an order to protect the forest and prohibit cutting, and at the same time, encourage tree planting. If only Arbor Day is commemorated and advocated, but the actual protection of forests and encouragement of cultivation are not carried out, then not only will the effect of increasing tree production not be achieved, but the number of trees will inevitably decrease day by day, which is definitely not Dr. Sun Yat-sen's expectation of emphasizing afforestation and increasing agricultural production. I hope the authorities pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Beiping, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After Japan took emergency measures against Vietnam this time, the Japanese authorities also took appropriate measures on the 10th for the remaining agencies of legal entities in North China. Minister Kusunoki also issued a statement saying that the French residents in North China had not engaged in enemy-benefiting activities, so he decided to respect their lives and property.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Indigenous People of Vietnam Welcome Japanese Military Measures; Decoux and French Military Commanders Detained <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Saigon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The moment the Matsumoto-Decoux talks broke down, the Japanese military authorities immediately took the necessary measures, detaining Governor-General Decoux and the commanders of the army, navy, and air force. Although there was a small amount of resistance here, the Japanese army in the northern, central, and southern regions completed the necessary measures within one to several hours. From the morning of the 10th, Indochina took the first step towards new life in extreme tranquility. At this point, the Japanese Empire will jointly strengthen the defense system of Indochina with the indigenous government. Because of this action by the Japanese army, the indigenous people, who had been under harsh rule in Vietnam for many years, suddenly burst into tears and smiles, and the dawn of singing praises to Indochina is near. The Japanese Empire has already declared that it will spare no effort to support their independence movement. Therefore, they are extremely grateful, and the voices of swearing to stand up and cooperate with Japan are filling the streets, especially the indigenous soldiers belonging to the former Vietnamese army, who are eager to be commanded by the Japanese army commander.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Enemy Advances Suffer Casualties in Northeastern Luzon <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On Luzon Island, while the enemy army was directing its main force towards the Japanese army's stronghold east of Manila, one division was attempting to attack the Japanese army's fortified line connecting northeastern Luzon to the highlands east of San Nicolas and San Jose. Its main force is gradually gathering around Shaokalanglang, about ten kilometers northeast of San Jose. The enemy, which has repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's position northeast of San Nicolas, moved about two companies of artillery to the line about seven kilometers northeast of San Nicolas on the 7th. The Japanese army in the north is fighting fiercely everywhere, concentrating artillery fire or using blitz tactics to make the enemy pay a heavy price. On the San Jose Banban Road alone, the damage inflicted on the enemy on the 6th and 7th of this month was killing or wounding 300 enemy soldiers. In the battle in the San Nicolas area, the comprehensive results of the Japanese army's harvest up to the end of February included killing or wounding more than 500 enemy soldiers, destroying two 10-mm anti-tank guns, two infantry guns, two rapid-fire guns, six heavy machine guns, and two vehicles, and capturing four mortars, six light machine guns, nine automatic rifles, and two communication machines.</p>
<p>Commemoration: To Commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death is to Inherit His Legacy and Realize Pan-Asianism!</p>
<h3 id="e7">Today is the Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death; Central Authorities Pay Respects at Mausoleum; National Tree Planting Movement Unfolds <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Today (12th) is the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. In order to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great personality and his great achievements, in addition to the central authorities respectfully visiting the mausoleum this morning, a national tree planting movement will be launched throughout the country to commemorate him. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the founder of the Chinese Kuomintang and the creator of the Republic of China. His Three Principles of the People is the only indicator of the Kuomintang and the highest principle of our country's nation-building. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the late Chairman Wang inherited his legacy and worked hard to implement it. On the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death today, unfortunately, Chairman Wang has also passed away. In these 20 years, we have lost these two great leaders, which is a great loss to the party and the country. Fortunately, acting Chairman Chen, with his years of experience in struggling for the party and the country, and with the center of adhering to the legacy, has risen to lead the country, engaging in the great cause of saving the country and building the party. This is something that we can be slightly comforted by in addition to commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen and mourning the late Chairman Wang. At this time when the ethnic groups of East Asia are uniting as one and the Greater East Asia War has laid the foundation for victory and the dawn of China's revival has appeared, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we feel even more the difficulty of the situation and the importance of responsibility. The abolition of unequal treaties shown by Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been achieved, and the international status has also been improved, but the national economy is still in decline. Facing the difficulties of the times, we should abide by the legacy and, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, be of one mind and one heart, dedicate ourselves to the construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood, increase production, stabilize people's livelihood, eliminate the remaining forces of British and American colonial economic aggression, enrich national strength and people's strength, and achieve the realm of autonomous economy, in order to comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Promoting Peaceful Unification and Fulfilling the Mission of the Era: Director Zhao Xuan Broadcasts to the Public <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department, considering the profound significance of the 20th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation on the 12th, coinciding with the critical phase of the Greater East Asia War, delivered a broadcast to the nation on the 11th from the Central Broadcasting Station, titled "Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the Death of the Father of the Nation," addressing all compatriots. The text of his speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Recalling the Past Twenty Years with Grief: Fellow Compatriots, today marks the exact 20th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation. Over these two decades, China has suffered from the disturbances of British and American imperialism. The peaceful years and unified situation were merely fleeting moments. In our experiences over these twenty years, we have reached a conclusion: unless we break free from the shackles of imperialism, the nation will not achieve independence and freedom; unless we eliminate the disturbances of the Chinese Communist Party, the nation will not achieve peaceful unification. In other words, the nation has not escaped danger, and the people have not escaped crisis. This experience and understanding are shared by all compatriots who care about the nation and the people. The reason we have this experience and understanding is because the Father of the Nation left us the great Three Principles of the People and the National Construction Program, which inspire us to seek strong external freedom and internal peaceful unification.</p>
<p>Five Years of Endeavor, Achievements Gained: This movement is the peaceful anti-communist national construction movement that we have been striving for over the past five years. The peace movement is advancing forward in accordance with the tasks indicated to us by the Father of the Nation's teachings. Therefore, the Father of the Nation's teachings are the highest ideals of the peace movement, and the peace movement is the starting point of the National Revolutionary Movement, the mainstream of striving for external independence and freedom, and internal peaceful unification. Under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, we have struggled for five years and achieved great accomplishments that the Father of the Nation dedicated his entire life to but did not complete. The Father of the Nation's instructions that "China and Japan should only be friends, not enemies" and "abolish unequal treaties" have been gradually realized. These are all great achievements gradually attained by following the Father of the Nation's teachings. As long as we quickly achieve peaceful unification internally, external independence and freedom will not be a problem. However, as I speak here, I feel a deep sorrow. We have witnessed the Father of the Nation's teachings being gradually realized. Unfortunately, the late Chairman also departed from the Party and the nation, unable to see China's complete independence, freedom, and peaceful unification.</p>
<p>Fundamental Policies Remain Unchanged: Acting Chairman Chen, with his many years of experience following the Father of the Nation in the Party and the nation's struggle, inherits the late Chairman's aspirations and leads the Party and the nation. With the unanimous support of the entire nation, we are advancing towards the great goal of "seeking internal peaceful unification and external independence and freedom." Today, as we commemorate the Father of the Nation, we must understand that "seeking internal peaceful unification and external independence and freedom" is the consistent spirit of the Father of the Nation and the late Chairman's lifelong revolutionary struggle. It is also the fundamental policy of China under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen in the future. Moreover, we must first complete peaceful unification before we can achieve independence and freedom. We can see this from the Father of the Nation's Northern Expedition. "Seeking internal peaceful unification" is a prerequisite for "seeking external independence and freedom." In order to address this issue and continue our efforts, the late Chairman Wang led the peace movement, and Acting Chairman Chen is strictly adhering to the late Chairman Wang's legacy, which is to implement this issue thoroughly.</p>
<p>Hope for the United Effort of Compatriots: When we see the current international situation and the progress of the Greater East Asia War, we will feel that this issue is much more serious than during the Father of the Nation's Northern Expedition, because at that time, the effects of the war could only hinder the nation's construction and deplete the nation's vitality. However, at this current juncture, it is related to the survival of the nation and the rise and fall of the people, which cannot be ignored in the slightest. Therefore, Acting Chairman Chen once instructed us emphatically at the beginning of this year: "China is now surrounded by crises. If we do not work hard, we may become a battlefield for the decisive battle, or we may become completely communist, or we may become a colony of Britain and the United States." This shows that the issue of peaceful unification is the urgent task at hand. I hope that all compatriots across the country will recognize that promoting peaceful unification is the mission of the era and immediately rise up and work together. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: The battle for the American bridgehead on the east bank of the Rhine River has become increasingly fierce. Protected by hundreds of fighter planes, the American First Army crossed the Remagen railway bridge with fresh troops and tank units. The German army is counterattacking. In Honnef, several kilometers north of Remagen, American troops crossed the river and invaded the city on Friday night and advanced north. The American troops were first driven out of the city but, after reinforcement, re-entered Honnef and are now engaged in street fighting.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: The most important event on the Western Front is the expansion of the American bridgehead opposite Remagen on the east bank of the Rhine River. The British and Canadian forces failed to break through the Xanten area. After passing through Bonn, American troops have advanced to the west bank of the Rhine. Although General Hodges' troops have been subjected to concentrated German artillery fire, they are still advancing north opposite Remagen and have reached Honnef. Therefore, the American bridgehead has now been expanded from Linz in the south to Honnef in the north. Street fighting is currently underway in Bonn.</p>

<p>Recently, a small number of citizens in the city have been using shortwave radios to listen to enemy news, which is then spread around, leading to various rumors spreading through the streets. Much of this involves misunderstanding enemy propaganda broadcasts, leading to distortions of the facts. It is understood that the municipal authorities, in view of this, are reiterating the strict prohibition of high-end radios with seven or more tubes and shortwave radios. Violators will be severely punished. Therefore, citizens who possess such radios should immediately and voluntarily surrender them to the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Various Industry Guilds Await Reorganization <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The organization of the city's various industry guilds has long been based on the "Industry and Commerce Guild Law," under which guilds are established after the initiation by seven or more firms in the same industry and approval by the competent authorities, with a total of more than 200 units. Later, the authorities promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Guilds," and the establishment of all industry guilds must follow these regulations. Recently, the Municipal Economic Bureau is planning to thoroughly adjust the organizational structure of various industry guilds, abolishing or merging those with similar characteristics, which is currently being actively carried out.</p>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau instructed the various industry guilds, saying: "Upon investigation, the handling of affairs by the city's various industry guilds is quite inconsistent. While many have sound organizations, there are also quite a few that have neglected their duties and exist in name only. The Bureau Director is determined to rectify the city's economic structure. For all guilds with similar business characteristics, poor management, and lax affairs, they will be merged and reorganized in order to strengthen the organization of various industries and facilitate the achievement of the mission of assisting the government in implementing economic policies." It also limited three days for the submission of survey forms. As for companies and firms in various industries, regardless of their business nature, they should join the respective industry guilds as members, pay membership fees, and comply with the guild's articles of association for buying and selling. Those who dare to deliberately wait and see and refuse to join the guild will be reported to the competent authorities by the guild once discovered, and will be punished in accordance with the law or have their business licenses revoked. It is understood that the Party and the authorities have repeatedly emphasized the requirement for companies and firms to join guilds, aiming to eliminate illegal buying and selling and strengthen the wartime economic system.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Summary of Recent Work of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee: Continued Borrowing of Preservation Funds <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>In July of last year, the committee established a loan of 600,000,000 yuan with Chinese and Japanese banking groups, with 300,000,000 yuan for purchasing funds and 300,000,000 yuan for preservation funds. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to guarantee this loan. The purchasing funds were used to pre-pay for wheat purchases, lent to designated purchasing merchants through the discount of promissory notes to banks. The preservation funds were used for expenses related to transportation, distribution, and the necessary preservation materials after the purchased wheat was processed into flour. Since the new wheat season began, the purchasing work has been launched, and the aforementioned funds have been gradually exhausted. In addition, the subsequent price fluctuations have been very severe, requiring purchases to be made primarily with cash. However, flour production by entrusted factories has been limited by transportation and electricity, resulting in delayed returns of funds. Therefore, negotiations were held with relevant parties, and an additional 300,000,000 yuan of preservation funds was borrowed from Chinese and Japanese banking groups in November, with each side responsible for half. This was also reported to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Finance to provide additional guarantees, using the same method as the previous loan of 600,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Pilot Administrative Purchase</p>
<p>At the beginning of the current wheat purchase season, the committee made great efforts to suppress the purchase price, and fortunately, with the assistance of relevant authorities, the process proceeded smoothly. However, subsequently, prices of agricultural products rose in various places, and wheat prices increased significantly as a result. If purchases were made at market prices, there was concern that this would affect the prices of rice and other agricultural products. In order to ensure the food supply for civilians and the military, and to seek separate remedial measures, the committee referred to the administrative purchase method for rice and temporarily implemented it in the Jiangsu province area. With the assistance of relevant administrative agencies, wheat and rice were kept in contact and purchased together. The committee designated purchasing merchants, provided them with purchasing certificates, and allowed them to carry out direct purchasing work in wheat-producing areas, isolating them from the market and avoiding speculation and manipulation. This was also approved by the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to comply and assist in the process.</p>
<p>Adjust Distribution Prices</p>
<p>The wheat purchased in the current season was purchased at newly determined prices, and the cost of flour production naturally had to be increased. The distribution prices of flour and bran in various places have been re-approved. However, after autumn, the purchase price of wheat and various expenses such as transportation, manufacturing, and packaging have continued to increase, rendering the previously set prices for flour and bran inapplicable. After detailed consultation with various parties, it was generally believed that a re-adjustment was necessary in order to maintain a balance between income and expenditure and allow production to continue. Therefore, starting in December of last year, the distribution prices of flour and bran in various regions were uniformly handled in accordance with the new plan. Cost calculation tables were prepared and reported to the Commerce and Trade Commission and the Executive Yuan for record.</p>
<p>Purchase of Stored Flour from the Former Food Ministry</p>
<p>After the former Food Ministry was abolished and merged, the General Management Office for Rice and Grain Sales, which belonged to the ministry, established a liquidation committee and was taken over by the Ministry of Industry. The committee negotiated with the Food Ministry to purchase the flour stored by the former Food Ministry in various locations in Nanjing and Suzhou at official prices. A total of 14,580 bags of flour were stored in Nanjing, and 2,477 bags of flour were stored in Suzhou and Wuxi. The committee instructed its offices to transfer the flour in the custody of the original custodians to the liquidation committee, and the quantities were checked and cleared. All payments due were cleared in January of this year.</p>
<p>Serving as a Director of the Unified Distribution Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Flour and Bran Unified Distribution Office was established on December 1, 1943, and its one-year term expired at the end of November of last year. The committee believed that the office's unified distribution work over the past year had been satisfactory and that the chairman, vice-chairman, and directors and supervisors had been competent. Therefore, it sent letters to the office's chairman, Yang Jingcheng, vice-chairman, Osaka Koichi, director Shang Yousheng, and Fujita Ichiro, etc., asking them to continue to serve in their positions, hoping to achieve familiar and skilled results.</p>
<p>Drafting Transportation Management Regulations</p>
<p>The committee was ordered to handle the unified control of flour and wheat and had previously drafted provisional measures for purchase, manufacturing, processing, distribution, movement, and prohibition, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and compliance. However, since the implementation of the previous measures, the purchase and movement items were still somewhat incomplete. In order to further strengthen the control work and strictly prevent hoarding and leakage, the committee drafted detailed rules for the implementation of the flour and wheat transportation and sales management regulations, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and they have been submitted by the Yuan to the 241st meeting for amendment and passed. They have been submitted by the Yuan to the 65th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council and passed, and the Yuan has ordered their promulgation and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e22">This City's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week: Prices and Hawala Showed Weakness <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai City have become more stable recently, and the people are very excited. Transactions have returned to normal, prices have continued to fall, and the fluctuations in Hawala have been mixed, eventually hovering around the 50 mark, with purchases still dominating. Silver has remained unchanged, public debt has fluctuated slightly, and although the Hua shares showed a strong downward trend in the first half of the week, the buying trend suddenly rose in the second half of the week due to positive news, and the stock market regained its peak. Most of the speculative funds are inclined to Hawala and Hua shares activities, which is a good sign of financial prosperity if they can be traded normally. It is difficult to expect the industrial and commercial sectors to flourish temporarily. If transportation can be restored to a considerable period of time and the production materials and fuel can be fully supplied, it will be the time for the revival of industry and commerce. Fortunately, the relevant authorities have recently been actively seeking to restore transportation, and a large amount of essential people's livelihood materials will soon be transported to Shanghai. Moreover, the weather is gradually becoming warmer, and the production of local products is increasing, so the source can continue uninterrupted. The people's daily necessities can be fully adjusted. Therefore, the people are at peace, and holders are selling off their goods, so prices continue to fall. Rice, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, fresh meat, and daily necessities are all trending downward. The new price limits for major commodities previously approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau are suitable for the level of sales in various stores. If the authorities can persistently enforce the prohibition of illegal trading by speculators, prices will not rise again.</p>

<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau said that the special business tax on native paper in the city is collected at 5% according to the estimated price. Recently, the price of native paper has risen sharply, and the original estimated price has been too long, so it is not applicable. Now, after estimating at the lowest price according to the latest market price, the original estimated price has been increased to 900%. It has been approved by the Municipal Government and has been taxing at the new occupied price since yesterday (the 11th).</p>

<p>From 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM on the 7th, the Changning Road Police Station successively cracked down on two cases of black market ticket sales. One was a ticket seller, Shao Yunquan, who defrauded a woman, raising the price to 2,000 yuan per ticket (original price 800 yuan) at the entrance. The other was a black marketeer, Shao Genzhao, who sold black market tickets for 5,000 yuan per ticket, also to a woman. The matter was discovered by the station's resident inspector, who immediately detained the ticket-buying woman to ascertain the facts. The woman then identified Shao Genzhao and others, who were taken to the bureau for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>My eleven-year-old daughter, who attends a nearby elementary school on Longmen Road, recently had many lice eggs found on her hairline. When combed, the lice wriggled and were uncontrollable. She had no choice but to shave all her hair off to try to eradicate them. The next day, her class teacher asked her why she did this, and the daughter explained the reason. The teacher then checked all the male and female students in the class, more than forty people in total, and found that no one was spared from having lice eggs. At the same time, the daughter of my friend Mr. Qian, who attends an elementary school on Weihaiwei Road, also has head lice. When she told her neighbors who have school-age children, they all found the same situation. It seems that head lice infestation among elementary school students in the city is widespread. Lice are carriers of infectious diseases, such as typhus, which is transmitted by lice. Isn't this dangerous? Schoolchildren are ignorant, so we must ask the school authorities and parents to pay attention to this. We must ensure a thorough cleaning of all to avoid cyclical infections. Treatment for lice: Bai Bu soaked in wine can be applied to the hairline, or kerosene can be used to wash the hair. (Zhaoguang)</p>

<p>The championship match between the Friendship Team and the Portuguese Business Team in the First Division was held at the racecourse yesterday morning at 10 a.m. The game was closely contested, and the stadium was packed with fans. Liu Xianhan, the goalkeeper for the Friendship Team, played despite being ill, which had an impact. Later, Zheng Yingquan replaced him as goalkeeper, which changed the situation. The Friendship Team took an early lead with a score of 2-0. In the second half, the Portuguese Business Team came from behind to lead 4-2. The Friendship Team lacked substitutes and could not compete, so they left the field. The game ended unhappily, and the audience was also affected. The referee, Chen Jixiang, was beaten, which was unfortunate. Shang Baozheng scored first, and soon after, Luo Shoufu added another goal, giving the Friendship Team a 2-0 lead. The Portuguese Business Team counterattacked, and Lieliao gained possession of the ball and rushed forward to shoot. Liu jumped up to catch it, but due to a long illness and insufficient energy, his foot slipped and he fell to the ground. Bao Xiu Tuo rushed forward and kicked the ball and the man into the net. The referee ruled that the Portuguese Business Team scored a goal, ending the first half 2-1. In the second half, Liu Xianhan, the goalkeeper of the Friendship Team, was replaced by Zheng Yingquan. Fu En scored, tying the score. Fu En scored twice in total, and the score became 2-4, with the Portuguese Business Team coming from behind. At this point, Wu Qixiang and Qu Yongfu of the Friendship Team left the field because Zheng Yingquan was injured, leaving only ten players to compete. Since there were no substitutes, they also left the field automatically. The audience rushed onto the field, and some of the audience even beat the referee. The game ended unhappily.</p>
<p>Portuguese Business Team: Pan Limei, Wei Ketai, Ke Laituo, Kao Sitan, Aolie Weila, A Ke Lasha, V Su Ruo, W Pan Tuosun, Bao Xiu Tuo Lieliao, Fu En.</p>
