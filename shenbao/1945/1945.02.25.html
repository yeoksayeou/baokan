<p>呂宋前線二十四日中央社電日軍於呂宋戰線，巳完成前期作戰，刻下除馬尼刺·科列甚多島外，漸呈膠着狀態，日軍實行得意之肉彈突擊與敵砲火周旋，予敵大損害。仁牙因方面無大變動，馬明剛及桑霍塞方面，敵後方汽車輸送漸趨頻繁，又羅沙留南方希宋東方高地，十九日拂曉以來，敵繼續攻擊，日軍將其擊退，固守旣設陣地。日軍又於桑霍塞南方炸破燒毀敵軍糧秣堆積所，大火遠處可望見，尼哥拉斯附近，敵以二大隊易擊日軍前進基地，經日軍突擊隊反攻，不支後退，最近兩周間，日方突擊隊的二十組，殺傷美兵員一二一六名，破壞其載重車十二輛，重榴砲七門，迫擊砲九門，機槍十四挺，速射砲七門，截獲彈藥糧秣等頗多，並有無線電四具，自動步槍等。又尋班地方日軍，對侵入該地北方之敵包圍其右翼，且行連續突擊，日軍砲兵發揮威力，獲相當成果。同時，日軍航空部隊又與地上軍相呼應，二十日夜奇襲仁牙因敵機塲及聖法比安敵物資堆棧，燒毀機塲三處，堆棧起火爆炸，日機完成任務後，全部安然飛返。又克拉克地區依然繼續激戰，戰線無變化，呂宋戰事現已孕育下次戰機，敵軍果能與日軍展開山岳戰，抑或將改取防禦戰，殊値重視。</p>
<p>呂宋前線二十四日中央社電科列基多島二十二日因敵軍猛烈之砲擊與轟炸，全島仍在硝烟籠罩中，彼此之通訊現已杜絕，然該島之日軍守備隊似仍在勇戰中，敵之艦船依然未能侵入馬尼刺灣，二十二·三兩日，敵軍對馬尼刺舊城及南部日守備部隊之砲火尤爲激烈，包圍日軍之敵兵，更增强援兵及火力，然日方將兵毫不介意，而繼續與之血鬥中。日海軍部隊，二十一日夜半曾對巴塞海岸附近敵陣實行壯烈之全軍突擊作戰，其他一海軍突擊隊中之一班，曾猛烈肉搏大總統官邸附近之敵，菲列賓大學二十二日業被敵軍轟炸，國立綜合醫院是日亦入敵手，院中之靑年少婦被掠者達兩汽車，雖其家族百般哀求，敵仍置之不顧，敵美之獸性行爲，暴露無遺。</p>
<h3 id="c2">硫磺島戰事重心　移向屏風岩　摺鉢山日軍確保陣地 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電硫磺島攻防戰，因日軍之猛烈反擊，巳使進至日軍陣地前方之敵軍，不能出進於西部，千島部落及中央方面，敵已不得已後退，敵雖不惜投以龐大兵力器材，始終頑强攻擊，但因每次皆遭日軍反擊，損失極度增加，即二十三日晨該島周邊之敵艦，於猛烈砲擊之同時，並以陸軍向元山機塲東南三百米之屛風岩方面攻擊，至當日正午，敵軍一部終將屛風岩佔領。該方面日軍部隊經增强兵力後，立即猛襲，至下午一時半即將屛風岩奪回，左翼前展之敵，雖仍繼續猛攻，但日軍依然確保陣地，使敵軍不得侵入，並更以一部於二十三日夜挺身突入敵陣地，如是，該島之作戰，已集中於屛風岩南側。至元山機塲南部，因敵對該地帶，每日以艦砲射擊達三萬發，故已完全被焚燬，化爲荒野，此外，於摺鉢山之日軍部隊，對二十二，三兩日之敵軍繼續猛攻，仍確保主要陣地激戰中。二十三日晨以來，因該島周邊一帶風浪猛强，敵艦船行動不能自如，欲登陸行動，亦吿遲緩。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　硫磺島日軍守備隊砲兵陣地，二十三日上午九時及下午一許，前後兩次對千島飛行塲及該飛機塲南側地區之敵軍集中砲火，結果該方面敵軍死傷枕藉，即附近一帶之物資倉庫，亦均燬於砲火，估計敵方損失極大。</p>
<p>敵軍死傷　四千餘人</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電硫磺戰綫日軍，仍然確保各地陣地，同時將士之鬥志已愈益昻揚，予敵損害極大。據二十二日外電稱，敵方發表死傷三千六百五十人，至二十三日達四千五百人，其犧牲之大，於此可見。又敵前後登陸兵已達三師，於南大堤至千島部落間，僅二公里之海岸陣地內，敵竟出此龐大兵力，故遭日軍猛攻之後，當即混亂不堪。又敵急於奪取之摺鉢山陣地，仍掌握於日軍手中，該方面所予敵軍損害甚大，日軍之守備將士，自部隊長及兵士，莫不皆有死守之決心，如速射砲兵隊之中村少尉，單身竟擎毀敵戰車二十餘輛，於二十三日已受褒狀，上達　聞，全員勇戰情形，於此可見。尤其二十一日下午五時五十分，由於神風特攻隊之對敵敢死轟炸，於東南方之水平綫上，可遠見大火十餘起，士氣莫不爲之一振。又二十一日夜至二十二日黎明中，各陣綫對敵齊行果敢挺身突擊，予敵損害尤大。</p>
<p>中太平洋前綫二十四日中央社電　硫磺島南部方面之日軍，二十二日夜曾兩度向敵軍南部登陸地點附近，展開突擊戰，首决傷敵百名以上，二次則傷敵二百名以上，二十三日夜再度出擊，毀其戰車四輛，並傷敵四百以上</p>
<h3 id="c3">利守不利攻　美軍受重創 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　據尼米資司令部二十三日發表稱：美軍於硫磺島作戰，累計損失達五千三百七十二名之多，該發表中曾謂，截至二十一日午後六時止，損失爲四千五百五十四名，此後較兩日問巳增加八百十名。又合衆社前綫隨軍記者亦報稱：美軍自十九日登陸作戰開始以來，平均每分間喪失海軍三名，過去塔拉瓦島於作戰七十二小時內，曾喪失兵員三千，已被稱爲太平洋上最激烈戰，今以硫磺島之役觀之，可知該島激烈苦戰情形。絕非常人所能想像。又據云，該島登陸作戰司令官達納，於會見記者團時，曾感嘆謂，硫磺島乃世界上最利於守，而不利於攻之島嶼。</p>
<p>日軍展開肉搏作戰</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電合衆社從軍記者，曾於二十三日將美軍於硫磺島摺鉢山地戰鬥情形報吿如次：當迫近日方陣地時，即遭日軍猛烈砲火之攻擊，由此可見日軍士氣極其昻奮，日軍被追至洞穴內，而成袋中之鼠者，但仍不肯投降。同時，亦有自懸崖上跳下自殺者，亦有被迫至山頂而投身於噴火口內者，使人無從下手。又稱：對中央機塲攻擊之美軍兩翼，已受日軍反擊，現在僅能於尺寸之間勉强前進，尤其左翼美軍，於二十二日曾兩度遭遇日軍迫擊砲火强襲，而展開凄烈之肉搏戰，同時，右翼亦遭日軍反擊，以致陷於混戰中。又二十二日夜，日海上部隊突於西岸美軍陣地之後，敢行挺身突擊，結果斃敵甚多。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日政府決設立　戰時建設團　充分發揮國內建設力 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日政府爲確立民間建設事業之決戰能態勢，充分發揮國內建設力量起見，决定設立特殊法人戰時建設團（假定名），業經二十三日閣議通過「確立戰時建設機構案」。該案目的，在使現有之魏設力集中於當前必需之建設工程，將原有之土木建築統制組合予以解散。另根據國家總動員法第十八條規定，設立特殊法人戰時建設團，作爲簡素强力之指導統轄機關，並於每一地方行政協議會區置設域分團。關於一切工程之承包。分配，監督，推進等，完全由分國負責辦理。</p>
<h3 id="c5">南匯第四區烏瞰 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>南匯縣之第四區，位處南匯縣之極北部，故前稱「遠北市」。西北界上海郊區，東界川沙，南與第五區爲界。又因前此本市淸鄕，南匯縣列入第一期，而四區之張江柵却列入第三期，故其封鎖線位在四五區之邊界，並設御界橋及孫小橋兩大檢問所，檢查行旅，以防匪患。</p>
<p>全區鄉鎭凡十四，人口六萬零八十六人，其密度除五區周浦外，以本區最爲稠密。居民業務農較多，惟西北部農民則以經營疏菜園藝爲主。該區因接近滬地，故一般居民謀生較易，生活狀况，亦較他區當裕。至居民之文化水準，以學校林立，兼因鄰近滬市，故較其他地區爲高。奈地方多故，故稍受敎育者，大都向外發展，以是該鄕設施反較前落後。</p>
<p>本區交通，河流除呂家浜，長　諸小河灌人白蓮涇，以通歇浦外，　他支流甚少，且均狹溢異常，舟楫之利較少，然區道縱橫，且均舖有碎石，爲他處所不及。據該區鄉人語記者：當地於民國二十六年時一度興築塘南公路（浦東塘橋至南匯），該時以公路之便，市面興旺。惜因事變中止建築，目前路基坍毀，行人冷落，景况巳大不如前。</p>
<p>治安情形</p>
<p>該區治安較其他各區爲佳，乃以地處極北，又因密遍滬地，大股遊匪不易插足。全區兵力亦較雄厚，除駐省保安敎導團四中隊外，尙有武裝警察二中隊，維持地方治安。</p>
<p>該區治安雖强差人意，但宜改善之處尙多。尤以擔任檢查行旅之機關，對所負責任，注意較少，而對貨物過境，則百般留難，致民間頗有煩言。希主管者今後加以改善。</p>
<p>菜市風光</p>
<p>按四區西北部毘鄰滬地，故居民經營菜園者特多。農家春韭夏蒜，秋菜冬菠，全年供應滬市，繼續不絕。每日下午三時左右，菜市塲中，人頭攢動，老幼咸集。評量聲，看貨聲，議價聲，么喝聲，同時並作，其熱鬧情形，實非禿筆所能形容萬一也。</p>
<p>入冬以還，寒冷特甚，田中所種菜蔬，經寒浪迭襲，强半凍壞，所餘者雖經農民加意保護，但其數已微，兼以運滬關卡林立，步步需款，又以行佣至重（値百抽十）故運抵滬市，售予市民時，其價已較原價幾增一倍。莫怪滬地蔬菜價格之昻貴也。</p>
<p>北蔡盛況</p>
<p>事變前北蔡原爲蕞爾小鎭，商業本不發達，至戰事西移後，南市精華大都破壞，兼之水道未通，貨物出入限制綦嚴，致走私之風，一時大盛，單帮商人，蝟集此間，販買日用品，兼之滬市以來源缺乏，　市恐惶，故該地之米市鹽市，應運而生。據調查：當地之黑市監塲，竟達十餘處之多，米店料櫛比林立，男女負販，摩肩接踵，類似勝會。據悉</p>
<p>當地有中小學各一所，中學係私立。僅二級，學生五十餘人，經費除學費收入外，皆由施滬紳商捐輪。小學係縣立，分九敎室，學生五百餘人，記者到達時適値假期中，故不克調查其詳情。</p>
<p>現任區長黃一平接事僅月餘，氏對當地鄕鎭長及地方士紳頗有連絡，故有所設施，均較前任爲順利，深望黃氏繼續努力，勿存五日京兆之心（該區區長邇來迭更），爲桑梓服務。</p>
<p>記者返周浦時，夕陽西照，白雪如絮，觀之心曠神怡，精神一爽。抵周浦時，已萬家燈火矣。</p>

<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電據大宮島之合衆社電稱：日軍將士於美軍佔領之太平洋各島中，依然冒困難條件，果敢展開游擊戰。二十三一日之報吿誌次：太平洋戰綫，現已移至硫磺島，爲美軍佔領之地區，雖已經相當時日，然戰綫後方各島，至今仍繼續戰鬥，塞班，迭尼安，大宮島，培里琉各島，依然潛有日軍，塞班島雖已化爲B29之基地，但十五，十六，十七三日內，美軍黑人聯隊，曾與三百五十名日軍將士展開激戰，美方發生死傷。</p>

<h3 id="c7">硫磺島戰事 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 英明</p>
<p>敵美自於二月三日開始突入馬尼刺以來，爲時已達三週，可是直到現在，敵美縱已付了極巨大的犧牲代價，却依然還不能完全佔領馬尼刺，所謂平定呂宋島結束菲律賓戰事，顯然爲期尙遠，敵美的焦燥和窘急可知。</p>
<p>爲企圖掩飾以馬尼刺爲中心的菲律賓戰事的挫折，並嘗試新的冒險，敵美最近竟又不惜化大量的代價，進攻隸屬於日本本土範圍的硫磺島。敵軍是於十六日起，開始在硫磺島週邊積極作登陸活動，十九日正式登陸。</p>
<p>於硫磺島進行登陸的同時，敵美一面又威脅着硫磺島東北海面的小笠原羣島，並進而侵擾日本本州東南部沿海地區。十六十七兩日，甚至調派以航空母艦十餘艘爲主體而編成的機動部隊，出現於木州東南近海，用艦載機往返轟炸關東及中部地方，這次轟炸且不僅以一般軍事交通設施爲目標，似允着眼於日本在木州東南沿海的空軍根據地，共有極大野心，已暴露無遺。</p>
<p>按硫磺島乃僅縱的八公里，橫的四公里的小島，合若干共他細小的島嶼，又併稱硫磺羣島。硫磺島居於馬利亞納羣島和日本木州東南部的中間，離橫濱和關島各的六百餘海浬，西離台灣的九百海浬，稍東北些即是小笠原羣島。</p>
<p>敵美侵攻硫磺島，其目的當然不是單單在於掩飾馬尼刺戰事的挫折。它是具有佔取硫磺島，從而再向其他地方作更大冒險行動的野心。敵美認爲硫磺羣島及小笠原羣島，在戰略上的地位很重要，現在乃是日本自本州東南至台灣一帶海區的哨站，要再前進，非先佔領這個哨站硫磺島不可。硫磺島分給與敵美海空軍的行動以很大的牽制，如係由馬利亞納羣島根據地飛往日本轟炸的敵機，便是常爲硫磺島的日本探空部隊所偵知，並受攔阻。</p>
<p>敵美的意圖，預備在硫磺島方面立足後，向北威脅日本木州，向西侵入中國東海，進而與由菲律賓北上的部隊，合而威脅中國沿海岸，即準備所謂大陸作戰。</p>
<p>據瑞典京城斯德哥爾糜消息，現有尼米資指揮下的太平洋敵美艦隊，分作三隊，第一隊遊弋於日本本土近海，第二隊正作戰於小笠原羣島硫磺羣島一帶，第三隊則在菲律賓海區。十六·十七兩日侵擾日本本州東南海的機動部隊，據說即屬第一隊。</p>
<p>硫磺島戰事正在進行中，日軍抗禦力極爲强大，迄至現在爲止，登陸敵軍的達達三萬餘名，可是其中至少三分之一上，已被日軍殲滅了。據說這次敵軍在硫磺島的登陸戰，其損失犧牲程度，較之過去在達拉瓦，迭尼安及馬紹爾羣島諸島登陸時，還慘重得多。硫磺島面積雖小，埋葬敵軍的容量却是很大。無疑的，敵美一切單相思的企圖，都將歸於慘敗。戰事愈接近日本本土，日本的防守力愈强，而敵軍的困難則愈甚。盟邦現在不僅在本土早已佈妥堅强的防衛，將使敵美却步；即在中國大陸，也已完成了全面防衛態勢，敵如來犯，必遭痛擊。</p>

<p>（問）今日推進新運之重點爲何？（答）今日推進新運之重點在農村，訓練各地農民均能自治自衛，增加生產補助敎育。（問）省長掌皖後，將如何推進皖省新運？（答）使與黨政軍一齊動員配合起來，同時推進，預料力量當能增大。（問）各地方推進新運似無重大發展，其原因何在？（答）其原因固由于縣長公務複雜，無暇顧及，且亦有縣長對新遝不甚明瞭，致影響發展。（問）各縣新運分會主委員是否由縣長兼任？（答）因由縣長兼任就不會如何協力。（問）有沒有好的方法呢？（答）祇有請新遝會的中央靑年幹部學校，多訓練一般新運靑年幹部，分派到各地方去協助縣畏，專門負責推進新運工作。（問）安徽各地靑年對新運的知識如何？（答）已有相當認識。（問）最近從皖省回來的人員說，新運在安徽已有顯著發展，其原因或者是省長一向負責新運的關係，預料將來其他各省也一定能够效法，各省新運的推進或有更積極的展開。（答）是的。（問）安微產烟地很多，吸烟的人也不少，不知對禁烟有何方策？（答）對禁烟已有禁烟實施委員會的成立，由本人兼任主任委員，會之下設總務，禁種，禁一運，禁吸，稽查等五組，主要目的即爲實施禁烟淸毒計劃。關於肅淸烟毒行動方面，曾於本月十一日，因靑少年同志及憲警人員環請檢舉，故特令警務處長伍麟趾，會同第七聯隊長率憲警及靑少年團員，施行烟毒總檢舉，先後在各區查獲烟館數十家，經過情形頗爲良好。總之，本人當以蚌埠爲絕對禁烟區，從此做起，于最短期內肅淸全省烟毒，力掃鴉片積恥，以陳代主席　續厲行禁烟政策而安慰汪主席在天之靈。</p>

<p>柏林二十四日中央社電海通社訊，德軍事發言人昨日指陳：敵軍大舉進攻魯爾蒙特與亞琛間之戰區，在吉維尼許。賽爾吉斯杜夫。及柏肯杜夫三地，建立小橋頭堡，各深數公里不等，辛浦森將軍之部隊，已越魯爾河抵達杜倫（Dueren）城邊，全綫戰事頗烈。</p>
<p>柏林二十四中央社電海通社訊：反軸心軍昨日在魯爾前綫進攻，大勢已進入緊張階段。魯爾河堤之潰決，延遲反軸心軍之攻勢，不僅利於西綫　德軍之備戰，似亦緩和整個戰局。反軸心軍不欲轉移亞琛方面之攻勢重心，亦由於給養品之不易移動，而敵軍進攻之處，早在德軍意斜之中。林尼許及杜倫附近，顯係攻勢焦點，美第一軍協助第九軍進攻，英第二軍亦將助戰，美第一軍大隊留於第九軍之後方，是否立即參戰尙不可知。反軸心軍殆欲衝入萊因河平原，席捲繆斯河德軍陣地，而囊括萊因河西岸之區域，然後侵入萊因河右岸之工業區，及德國北部之大平原。美軍物力優越，已在數處渡魯爾河，迫近杜倫城近郊但不足以決定戰局。過去之經騐顯示反軸心軍大攻勢之成敗，不能決定於德軍防區之邊緣。</p>

<p>上海特別市防空本部，以最近敵美空軍企圖擾亂和平地區民心，在各大都市濫施轟炸，殘殺我國人民，證諸漢口處實况及就本市防空現狀而觀，防空壕之普及與擴充，爲必不可少之舉，故決定自三月一日起至七日止（一星期）實施防空壕建設週，希每一市民在此建設週內，努力設法完成防空壕之建設，以避免敵機空襲之損害，並由市警察局通令所屬各分局，對於保甲人員及一般市民，應使澈底明瞭此事之旨趣，依照實施辦法積極完成，或補修擴充，務期妥善無瑕。周兼防空本部部長，特發表談話，希望每一市民，皆盡其個人最大努力，實現此項計劃。茲誌防空壕建設辦法及周兼部長談話如次：</p>
<p>建設辦法</p>
<p>（一）私有空地，（二）公共空地，（三）住屋以內，（須有出口）（四）防空壕式樣以地下式或半地下式，裝有頂蓋者爲理想標準，如因資材勤苦人他關係不克裝蓋，仍應逐漸設法加裝。（五）關於建設所需費用，全部由建設者負担之。（六）以能收容十五人以內爲標準，並須能由兩方出入。（七）如係有蓋式，以三寸徑以上之木材或竹材間隔一尺五寸配列之，作爲樑柱，並覆以三十糎厚之泥土。（八）出入口必須構築堅固，不受爆炸力之影響。（九）在公共空地及道路上建築時，對於地下埋設物之有無，須請示市工務局從事調查，但南京路北四川路及大上海路，當由工務局調查該項地下埋設物之有無，並指示建設並無妨碍之地點。（十）如在私有空地建設，而被空地所有人之拒絕時，分局須積極努力斡旋之。（十）（一）在防空壕建設週實施時，各分局長所選派担任之人員，應隨時前往建設塲所，妥爲指導。（十）（二）在防空壕建設週實施期內，得省略本案第九條所載取得工務局許可之程序，以減省市民麻煩及取得許可所需時間，僅照所屬警察分局長對於建設場所適當與否之指示，極力從事建設，各分局須不負市民之期待，應予調查建設塲所是否適當。</p>
<p>部長談話</p>
<p>關於上海特別市市民防空本部計劃實施之防空壕掘建週，周市長特以兼部長資格，發表談話如左：有備無患一語，實爲　撲不破之良言，徵之史實，足以證明斯言之不謬。溯自大東亞戰學爆發以來，友邦日本已在爭取全東亞之生存自由中，充分發揮其道義精神，吾人亦在此生殛關頭而與盟邦協力作戰。然敵美仍以全力支援重慶政權，且於我各大都市實行盲炸，此積行爲，不過使多數無辜平民，受其慘害，大好之城市，瀕於毀滅，此違法民人道之行爲，已在盲炸漢口地區中表現無餘。當此決戰之秋，敵機之空襲上海，自亦屬意中事。爲使空襲之損害減至最小限度，防空本部當局已迭次呼籲急速　建防空壕，然結果殊朱未能使人滿意。以最近敵機之投彈掃射及防空高射砲所引起之損害而觀，足證明防空設施之亟待改進者，仍屬甚多。爲貫徹推進全上海市民防空壕建設之目的起見，訪空當局特舉行防空壕掘建週，以喚起全體市民普遍之注意及實施。市民諸君須知此項措施，實爲市民本身生命財產着想，故極希望市民與該管警察分局緊密協力，以求此項措施之完成。此項防空壕自然以在公共空地或路旁掘建爲原則，然如地下工事如自來水管或瓦斯管，有所障礙，則在某種情形下，亦可不受其拘束。本市建設局（以前爲工務局）即將開始調查地下工事所在地，市民在掘建防空壕前，可先詢儲建設局以便確知掘建地點下地下工事之有無，而能得一正確之指示，個人或團體亦應向各該管警察分局共同計劃，俾求其掘建臻於一律。各警察分局自能協助人民，在建設局指示下，從事掘建。在防空壕掘建週，希望能有最多數防空壕因而掘成，幷希望每一市民皆盡其個人最大努力，以求此項計劃之實現也。</p>

<h3 id="c26">重視自肅之道 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>最近市上盛傳：某處大規模聚賭，宛然賭塲復活。某處舞塲可特殊營業至深夜三時，因爲潛用了特殊名義，所以有恃無恐。</p>
<p>同時，我們也曾接到許多讀者的來信，認爲在市政革新之際不應有此現象，我們相信，如果確有其事，市政常局，決計不會放任，市民可以放心的。</p>
<p>名義是名義，事實是事實，決不能潛用了名義，就可以淆混事實，吏不能掛了羊頭的名義，就可以行使賣狗肉的事實。在此決戰時期，在此市政刷新時期，社會事態均須向適應戰時體制有益於公衆福利的方向前進。如果違反戰時體制，違反公衆福利，縱有偷天換日的手段，縱有朦混取巧的伎倆，必然爲社會與論的共　而一致反對。</p>
<p>我們希望旅居滬市的中日官民，共同認識時代的趨勢，重視自肅之道。</p>

<h3 id="c35">「大英帝國」之　破產白皮書　以訴苦哀求各國的援助　恢復昔日地位已成夢囈 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>英政府於去年十一月二十八日，發表所謂「破產白皮書」，自動表明在五年的戰爭中，己蕩盡「祖父時代以來的大半」。英國業己使用維多利亞朝以來的遺產，固爲周知的事實；但英政府何故特地宜揚這些事實呢？正如債台高築的人希望怕他破產的債權者暫時使其免於破產一樣，英國故意將自己的窘况曝露在美國以及英帝國各自治領與舊英鎊集團各國之前，以期由這些國家的援助，恢復其昔時的國際地位。這就是說：英國已不能也不望用正當的方法，來自力更生，祇圖利用他國。不過，這可說是危險的走鋼絲戲。業已色衰容黯的英國，她的哭泣是否能够打動變了心的國家，不無疑問。總之，「破產白皮書」可謂已經證明英帝國危機的深刻已在預想以上了。本文即從上面的覜點，概觀英帝國的過去。現在與將來的盛衰，以及英國所遭遇的國內國外的矛盾。</p>
<p>兩刃的利劍</p>
<p>「過去百年間，成爲英國之存在基礎的各種條件，英國雖自信得歷永劫，但實際上不過是易於變動的東西而已，此在今日，隨歲時的遞嫂，已日益明顯了。</p>
<p>這是安得列·齊格弗里特在「英國之危機」緒論第一頁上面說的話。這句寫在一九三一年英國遭遇空前危機時的話，今日巳無須再加什麽說明。因爲第二回的世界大戰，已使英國所佔國際地位的政治經濟上的前提，瀕於危殆。——此是無可置疑的明顯事實。</p>
<p>前次大戰以來，英國如何使齊格弗里特所謂「易於變動的東西」，適應急劇轉變的世界現實形勢呢？如何盡可能使它延續下去呢？這是兩個不絕提出來討論的問題。作爲資本主義祖國。世界的工廠而登塲於近代史的英國，一面絕端墨守資本主義的傳統，一面却以徹底的現實主義爲根據，拼命努力想使自已的步調與世界進步中的新方向符合。因此，深信「得歷永刧「者愈明白「易於變動」的東西，便愈認眞努力。現在的戰爭所以發生，其起因之一可說就是英國的這種焦慮吧。</p>
<p>可是，以舊皮囊盛新酒到底是不可能的。英國所採取的各個政策，就其自體而言，固然都是符合常識，適乎現實的。但這些政策的「集大成」，却不外是更爲加深老大帝國所有的煩惱。英德開戰以還，英國會如何巧妙利用美國和蘇聯的力量呢？然而，因此在今日英國又如何苦於美蘇勢力的伸張呢？觀乎此，個中眞相，即可自明。</p>
<p>以上的事情一面使英國的內外政策，頗爲巧緻，一面却又造成大漏洞。例如爲所謂綏靖政策之權化而寂然謝世的英國前首相張伯倫，一定很明白英國如再捲入前决大戰那樣的戰爭中，則業已剝蝕的英帝國存立的基礎，必會龜裂。正因如此，所以才肯於慕尼黑低首下心於希特勒之前。然而，爲圓維護日薄　嵫的英帝國，抑止新與的軸心國計，在一年之後，這位張伯倫宰相却不得不對德宣戰了。在英國的手裏，連兩刃的劍也沒有一柄呀。</p>
<p>豪華的過去</p>
<p>由於今日的壓史進展過速，人們輒易忘記過去。英國相信十九世紀中使其國家繁榮的基礎，可以永歷萬世的事，今日想來，不免有夢囈之感。不過，欲知英國國際間的地位，業已低落到什麽程度，仍有一瞥維多利亞朝的必要。</p>
<p>英國哲學家經濟學家斯丹萊·耶馮士，於一八六六年曾寫下如左的一節話：</p>
<p>「築於我們有的煤炭資源上的自由貿易，巳使地球表面的幾許部分進而成爲英國的屬領：——北美和俄羅斯的平原，是我們的田野；芝加哥及敖得薩是我們的榖倉；加拿大與波羅的海沿岸是我們的森林；澳洲的牧塲正爲英吉利飼羊；南美則有英吉利的牛羣；秘魯帶來了白銀；加里福尼亞和澳洲的黃金流入了倫敦；中國人爲我們栽培茶葉；荷印的農塲則送來咖啡·砂糖和藥料；西班牙與法蘭西是英吉利的葡萄園；地中海沿岸都是英吉利的果圃。我們的棉田，以前是在北美合衆國的南部，今日則在世界的主要產棉地區到處都有。」</p>
<p>這就是所謂不列顚和平（Pax　Britannica）。這種「英國統治下的和平」，係建築在其他許多國家的犧牲上，今日巳無人不曉了。「無論誰，只要一看英帝國的地圖，都要抱頭羞慚吧！」這是斯泰福特。克里浦斯動爵過去爲社會主義者時所說的一句話。所謂「自山」貿易者，便是先遣傳敎師，然後再派軍艦和軍隊土開拓商品銷路，强行交易之謂也。中國溺於鴉片，印度永陷飢餓，非洲土人像蝗虫一樣被殘殺：——這就是」自由」貿易的眞相！甚至以「文明國」自任的歐洲各國，在英國人的眼裏也是低一等的人。「船上來的都是黑奴！」這句某英國人說的傲慢話，正足表明當時英國人的優越感。</p>
<p>王座的朽壞</p>
<p>一八四六年廢止穀物條例之際，洛勃特·庇爾勳爵曾說。。「英國有怕競爭的必要嗎？「但自二十世紀以降，英國已非不怕競爭的國家了。在由英國而大成的國際貿易上，和英國角逐而凌駕英國之上的國家，陸續出現。扼要地說，即有比英國貨價廉物美的商品出現了。英國那種如此重要的「自山」貿易，結果竟危及英國自身的存立。</p>
<p>促使英帝國衰落的，不單是和他國競爭。英國誇耀於世界的國內政治。經濟。社會體制及殖民地統治政策，也隨歲月的消逝而徐徐從內部朽腐起來了。於是內外兩方的崩潰作用，便相互有了密切的關係。</p>
<p>上述英帝國沒落的因子，由於第一次世界大戰的爆發，大顯其作用。英國在前决大戰所懷的意圖，即在抑止德國的勃興，保持歐洲的勢力均衡，維護英帝國的通商路綫，奪取德國的殖民地。這些目的，後來固然暫時達到，但經戰時及戰後，英吉利的國內體制和英帝國的凝集力，却曝露出它們的脆弱性。在世界市塲上，美國代德國而起，成爲英國的勁敵，而其餘各國也各別鞏固其作爲英國競爭對手的地步；加以英國和美國等造成的凡爾賽體制，又反而促令納粹德國及法西斯意國等的勃興。</p>
<p>前决大戰後英國的苦惱，最集中地表現出來的，就是一九三一年的金融危機。爲世界恐慌之一環而襲擊英國的這次金融危機，顯明了英國在國際貿易及金融上已不得不輸美國一籌的事實。由資本家和納稅人的負擔贍養失業者，藉此「購得社會安定」的英國社會政策，顯露了它的限界。</p>
<p>際此金融危機，英國所取的政策，第一是實際貶低英鎊價値，採用英帝國貿易保護政策，以圖振興輸出，一方面在國內則減少失業津貼，以期恢復財政的平衡。這兩項對於英國都是劃時代的措置，然而仍舊不免招致英國的政治危機。當時任第二次工黨內閣首相的麥唐納，爲抑壓工黨的反對削減失業津貼起見，宣吿退出工黨，組繳了舉國一致的內閣。政治的危機雖然由此克服，但英國政界自此以後却分爲以保守黨爲中心的舉國一致派，及以工黨爲主體的在野派了。此二派的關係，不像過去的保守黨（Tory）和自由黨（Whig），使政黨便於私相授受政權，乃是以舊有保守勢力，對於新興政治勢力——勞動階級的關係爲基調的。所謂憲政的常道，在此種情勢之下，不能圓滑作用，殊爲明顯。自此以後，英國在政治上就一直是「非常時期」了</p>
<p>歲計則不足</p>
<p>英國今日在歐洲則和美蘇兩國協力攻擊德國，同時在東亞則與美渝共同展開對日反攻。</p>
<p>回顧這次大戰開始以來，英國所走的路途，在戰爭上可說幾巳敗北，僅在運用權謀挽回頽勢這一點上是成功了。鄧扣克慘敗後，由於德國機羣的轟炸英倫三島，令人感到有不能再起之狀，幸有德蘇戰爭的演變，始得稍舒喘息。其後即力求美國援助，利甩美蘇兩國的力量，結果才能將德軍推回國境綫。其間，在內政上也會幾度直面危機，尤其在大東亞戰爭大吃敗仗之時，邱吉爾內閣曾受到與論嚴峻的糾彈，不過因爲與開戰同時而成立的各黨政治休戰協定現尙存續，所以國內體制未見大的變革。遠如一九四〇年至四一年間對倫敦的連續大轟炸，近如V１號。V２號的威力，直使英國民衆淪於恐怖的深淵，唯尙未因此而完全喪失戰意罷了。</p>
<p>然則，英國至少迄今爲止，不是已經山戰爭鞏固了自存自立的根柢了嗎？實則不然！如上所述的英帝國的煩惱，由於戰爭的冒險，表面上固已稍形彌縫，實際上母寗反而迅速深刻化了。</p>
<p>莊子曰：「日計不足，歲計有餘。「自鄧扣克一役以來的英國，恰與此相反，乃是日計有餘，歲計不足。（譯自第二十五卷第五十一期同盟世界週報）</p>
<h3 id="c36">硫磺島戰區形勢圖 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>敵美於本年一月中旬起，在菲律賓的民大諾·明多羅·仁牙因·馬尼刺等地相繼登陸，現正在呂宋泉北部展開激烈戰爭。敵美在呂宋島方面，蒙受極大損害，有被日陸海軍殲滅的可能。因此敵軍處於呆滯戰局之下，更見焦急，乃於本月十六日向日本本土附近之硫磺島開始登陸作戰。數日以來，其進展不過二三百碼之地區，敵人以苦戰失利，士氣大爲沮喪，日軍則沉着應戰，利用空軍及陸上部隊協力迎擊，海上則發揮潛艇之威力，故敵方所遭受之損失，較之以往吉爾貝特，塲金之戰，尤有過之。據敵方宣傳，擬再尋求第二個根據地，如向硫球，台灣，或中國沿海方面侵攻。但觀於此次硫磺島敵方登陸時所遭之重大打擊，此種企岡終成夢想也。</p>
<h3 id="c37">德國的新兵器　原子炸彈　爆炸威力百倍於炸藥 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>連鎖破壞鈾（Uranium）原子核的實騐，如果成功，那末使可發揮非常大的結合能（Energy），這是我們迄今尙未經騐過的，其威力幾百萬倍於今日所用的炸藥。據傳西歐德軍在這次大攻勢中使用具有可怖的破壞力的原子炸彈，聽到這個消息時，不禁令八想到今日列强炸藥專家最關懷的「諾伊曼炸藥」。　諾伊曼炸藥，以德蘇兩國爲主，已開始用於戰軍砲，它的破讓力非常猛烈，可以貫穿從來的火砲絕對不能擊破的重裝甲鋼板。道是一種將火藥的爆炸力集中一個方向的特殊方法。</p>
<p>如果能將諾伊曼炸藥這種大壓力集中一點，那末列國競相硏究中的鈾原子核的人工破壞就有可能了。原子核的破壞問題，日本的科學家如前年度得文化勛章的湯川秀樹博士及其恩師仁科芳雄博士等，亦在埋首研究中。</p>
<p>茲將破壞原子核的道理概括說明一下。氫氧等元素是由叫做原子的東西造成的，而原子則由原子核及迦　其周圍的電子所形成。原子核是由叫做中性子的東西和稱爲陽子的東西構成的。換句話說，將化學性質相同的物質的構成要素純粹提取出來的東西，便叫做原子。例如原子量二三五的鈾原子核，是由九二陽子及一四〇是性子合成的，其原子核的周圍環繞九二電子。</p>
<p>這種原子核，曾被認爲是不變的，但由放射能（Radioactivity）的研究等，始明原子核具有變化的性質，因而產生」這種自然變異的東西不能用人工破壞嗎」的思想。這就是所謂「原子核的人工破壞」。更因由此破壞現象飛出中性子，再將决種中性子當作原子核，可起第二次的破壞。因而相信所謂邋鎖破壞是有可能性的。不過此須龐天的裝置，所以各國原子物理學家的硏究目標都集中在發見用何種人工放射能物質可簡單的析出中性子。此外，不僅限於鈾，還可利用同位元素的釷，所以其他重元素的探究也成爲原子物理學界的重大課題。德軍的V三號究竟是原子核破壞兵器呢？抑是使用憑我們的常識所不能想像破壞力極强的火藥的兵器呢？現在是無從確實知道的。（譯自每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 劉臨</p>
<p>夜晚，街道上幾乎沒有一個行人。街燈的光顯得很慘澹。偶爾有幾輛黃包車停在路側，車夫把身子縮做一團，想找到他們最後的主顧。路口還有水菓攤子；叫賣油荳腐錢粉的担子。只要拐個灣，回過頭就再看不見燈盞的那點火光，祗有寒風的呼嘯裏還夾雜着聲聲機續的橄欖的叫賣聲</p>
<p>地面潮濕得很，不時雙足會踏進水潭——當你聽到脚下有水的濺擊聲時你纔能覺察。空間散佈着濃重的霧氣。「明天怕是個雨天。」</p>
<p>夜行不是件可喜的事。拖着倦怠的身子，獨自歸家在夜晚，我己經慣於這種生活了。</p>
<p>慢慢地走着，讓寒風吹進衣襟。我慢慢地向黯黑的深處走去。</p>
<p>當然，我會想起最好我能把自己緊閉在狹隘的斗窒裏；讓孤燈作伴，我可以讀幾冊書，寫一些零星的東西，再不，覆幾封早就收到了的朋友的信。我決不會想起那些囂擾的靡爛的歡娛的塲所，咖啡館，夜總會，但我會想起恬靜的生活。</p>
<p>慢慢地走着，嘆一口氣，默默地。望望天，墨黑的，不像會轉晴。幽暗的天空裏半顆星也沒有。</p>
<p>我不喜歡星兒，像一些精靈，他們散發的是誘人的昏黯的光。索性是藍得透明的天空佈滿了繁星也罷，我厭惡天際僅飾着三數顆星。沒有星，我不會給勾引起什麽幻想。我什麽都不想，除了那恬靜的生活，那不是虛懸的而是現實的想頭。遠離了家庭，那孤寂的恬靜的生活似乎能給我些微的滿足。我終於連恬靜的生活都不想，什麼都不想</p>
<p>「爲什麼我不能享受這一刻恬靜的生活呢？」</p>
<p>這樣你會不自由主地牽到旁的念頭：「爲什麼？」甚至你會回矚遠遠的過去或者想像太遠的將來！當你把思緒拉回來，想到你正獨自摸索在黑暗裏，你會覺得寒冷侵襲着你。堅勁的風，不僅透過你的衣衫，也因此透過你的心胸。</p>
<p>寒氣依舊是寒氣，不會爲你增減一分，但我爲什麽要怨恨，悲哀，也因而感受到寒氣的脅迫呢？</p>
<p>一抽一枝烟吧。」我想。我慣於在夜歸的途上抽一枝或兩枝烟，並沒有何任理由。我感到抽烟祗有在這塲合才適宜。你會感到烟的親切，同時它也不會妨礙你的工作或損害你的休息。</p>
<p>掏了烟，好容易點上了火。邊走邊吸。烟不會給我甚麼靈感。我從不曾想到從烟的氣息裏探取靈感。把烟啣在嘴裏，點着的火藏在裏面。當我抽的時候，我見到一點火光。它不能爲我指引路，我仍得摸索。當然我更不會可笑到利用它來計算時間或路程。我熟知這一些，四十五分的步行，從寬坦的柏　到終年泥　的陋巷。抽着烟，我照舊覺察到空間蘊着的潮氣緊緊地困着我。我不能舒暢地呼吸。而我更得忍受寒冷；我的心是火熱的，我還感到體內的執度正散向寒冷的四周。「即使衣服穿得再厚些也沒用的。」</p>
<p>「假使我是一個病者，一個身體羸弱的人，我怎能過這樣的生活。」</p>
<p>「不能從這方面想，我是一個健全的人，也不是一個孤寂者。「</p>
<p>終於我又甚麼也不想。</p>
<p>我抽着烟。</p>
<p>我沉默地走着。</p>
<h3 id="c39">溫情 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>朋友！在凄寂的生命里，能夠獲得一絲可以依附的「溫情」，那末；您該是將如何的欣喜呢！也將會如何的給鼓舞起生活力呢！您是一個畫家，那末，一定會爲它而起勁地舞動畫筆，您會唱歌，那一定歌聲裏含着甜汁。　會寫得詩作得文，那末，裏面也就會密藏着您心底的秘密……。</p>
<p>這是必然的！朋友，是不是？您也相信了。</p>
<p>假使您說世界上的人類是太自私了，太醜惡了，太卑陋了！而簡直難以找到一個可以寄託您「溫情」的對象。這話，我可以承認您是對，但，同時也可以否認地說您是錯。因爲，在以前我也的確曾同樣地像您那般的想過，並且，還堅決的自信是對的！但是，但是在近來，……我却發現着我的「自信」漸漸地在起了動搖，至少從今日起，我就認爲全人類中決不是絕對的沒有「溫情」的！所成問題的是——遇合！</p>
<p>您笑了！您覺得我說得有些兒意思了，是不是？那末，您且燃起一枝紙烟，——不！雪茄更好。再靜靜地聽下去吧。</p>
<p>譬如像您這個時候吧，或許您是斜倚在軟軟的沙發裏，微微地闔着眼，悠悠地在噴着烟圈，也或者正在喝着Ｃ，Ｐ，Ｃ的咖啡，嚼着花生或巧克力。而您的小屋子裏吧，却祗有您一個人，靜悄悄地連您自已輕微的呼吸，也可以淸楚地聽得出來，朋友－那末您也可曾想起到，或者竟企求着挺好會有一個同您談得上一些話的人，在您的身旁，——同性和異性都沒有問題。靜靜地聽着您說那些「要說的話」也緩緩地說給您聽那些「您所歡聽的話」，或者您們都是喜愛「藝術」的吧！那末，把話題轉到「藝術」方面，那就更好。</p>
<p>但是，在事實上，包圍在您四週的，却完全是一些莫明其妙的不合式的人物，您找不到一個合乎理想的値得寄託您「溫情」的人，於是，你苦悶了，空虛，沉默……。</p>
<p>在這樣情形下的您，我會同情您。但是；假使因此而就武斷地說，人類中簡直完全沒有像樣的人，那我可就要說您是錯了</p>
<p>我吿訴您，您不一定要把自已拘束在一個預定的「小圈子」裘的！「小圈子」以外，還有着「大大」的圈子呢！</p>
<p>過去，我眞也曾犯過同您同樣的錯失，但是，近來却仍給自已推翻了那種歪曲的理論。</p>
<p>在近來，認識我的朋友們都說我變了！像完全換了個型，是的！或許是吧。——因爲，我已推翻了我以前所確立的理論。</p>
<p>我相信了！人間是有着「溫情」的！——隱藏世界的每一角，孤寂朋友們哪！找吧，發掘吧！它會使您凄寂的生命，變得主動而活潑的呢。</p>
<h3 id="c40">燈的故事 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 藍羽</p>
<p>燈前小語</p>
<p>擦起一支火柴，淡黃色的燈光遂劃破蒼凉的暮色，海上的水霧一樣的，香爐裏氤氳的靑烟一樣的暮色，而讓靜謐的屋子蒙上了一層薄薄的淡黃色的細綱了。</p>
<p>對着孤燈如豆，看着微微地顫抖着的火光，我感到寂寞了。</p>
<p>是的，是寂寞在啃嚙着孤獨者底那顆痛苦的心。</p>
<p>聽着街頭漸漸地沉寂，一些脚步聲踽踽地由遠而近，又由近而遠。我知道這一天的日子，又在踏上它底熬綿的行程，去到遙遠的不能見得的地方去了。——這無窮無盡的日子。………</p>
<p>我該怎樣消磨這一個寂寞的夜晚。</p>
<p>不時地走到窗前，望望窗外的街燈，然而街燈也是沉默的，有如一些蒼白的沉默的眼睛。</p>
<p>那上面是　　的天空，沒有月亮，也沒有星星。——有一顆，我知道那是黃昏星。</p>
<p>我希望有個夜間來訪的客人，一個朋友，或是一個遠地的歸客。然而沒有。街頭連脚步聲也不聽見了。於是我在檯子邊坐下，支着　，在燈前，在寂　裏。……我該怎樣消磨這一個寂寞的夜晚呢？</p>
<p>２　更夫和風雨燈</p>
<p>我想起了丁貴，那個小城裏的一個更夫，和他的那盞風雨燈。</p>
<p>凄冷的梆子聲在黑夜裏響起，更夫了貴從深巷裏走來了。每夜，提着那盞風雨燈，跟白晝裏的一個卜者一樣，從長街到深巷，從深巷到長街，爲這小城途來一點聲音。叩問着人們的夢，也催促人人更矇朧的夢裏，披着滿身的星月，從黑夜走到天明。…</p>
<p>幼年時候，曾聽到過一些關於更夫的故事。一個更夫在街頭的餛飩担上吃完餛飩，抬起頭預備付錢，却突然這見賣餛飩的人正將自已底頭從身體上搬下來擱在扁担上。另一個更夫在深巷裏遇到一個夜行的美女，恍惚地跟着她走進一個豪華的宅第，第二天却給人發現躺在荒塚叢裏。……</p>
<p>爲此，我對更夫丁貴感到一些神秘了。更夫原是被人看做神秘的，白天是夢者，夜裘却是精靈。</p>
<p>「你不感到懼怕麼？」我問他，在某一夜，梆聲敲過我底窗下的時候</p>
<p>「走夜路的人是不會怕什麼的，先生·　」他安靜地回答：「而且，我還有這個。」</p>
<p>他舉起那盞風雨燈。</p>
<p>「有它在，我什麼也不怕的。」他向我點點頭，走上他底路。</p>
<p>凄凉的梆聲又響起來了。</p>
<p>３　長明燈</p>
<p>記憶裏亮起一盞長明燈，家鄕城外那個大廟裏的不滅的火。</p>
<p>長明燈供在金身的佛前面，廟裏的僧人向每個遊客說；</p>
<p>「從有這寺廟起，長明燈從不曾熄過。無數的人們不斷地送香油來，讓它永遠點下央，永遠東下去。」</p>
<p>「要是熄了呢？」有個孩子不懂地問。</p>
<p>「要是熄了。」僧人臉上突然嚴肅起來：「那就世界大亂，人類遭受到大刧，昏昏沉沉，沒有天日·千萬不能讓它熄的，不能讓它熄的·你看，從古以來它就沒有熄過，而且，它也是永遠不會熄的。」</p>
<p>事實上它確是沒有熄過，且不必說過去的遙遠的歲月，單是從我看見它來，每次到那廟裏去，長明燈總是亮着，小城的人們底心頭都亮着這長明的聖火。他們覺得，只要長明燈亮着，他們總會過到好日子，那個廟裏的僧人不是說過，「善薩是有眼睛的」麽？…</p>
<p>離開家鄕十年了，願向歸去的風，致一片懷念。並且以絕大的虔誠，祝福於小城裘人們心頭上的聖火，那盞千古不熄的長明燈。</p>
<p>４　燈塔</p>
<p>想像飛馳到夜的海濱，那兒聳立着一座燈塔。</p>
<p>該感謝第一個築燈塔的人，默默地保護也救了不知多少人的生命。孩子們的書本上，曾有一支燈塔的故事，一位老年人和一位年靑的女兒曾怎樣在浪濤裏，在深夜裏，以微弱的力量擊退大海和黑夜的襲擊，而使一船旅客從死神的手掌下重回到人世間來</p>
<p>向孩子們講這個故事的時候，曾引起一些同情，欽慕和興奮的。</p>
<p>「後來怎樣呢？」孩子們慣常在故事結束的時候，這樣地問。</p>
<p>「後來沒有了。」我說：「被救的人們一個個地回到他們自已底家鄉去，剩下那一對父女依舊在那座燈塔裏。</p>
<p>「沒有人陪着他們麽？」有人好心地問：「他們只有父女兩個于，多孤獨！」</p>
<p>「有誰陪他們？」我回答：「而且，燈塔裏的人總是孤獨的。陪着他的只有那盞燈。」</p>
<p>親愛的先生，當你旅行在大海上的時候，白晝裏在甲板上看着那一片無垠的波浪，夜晚在幾層樓上的大廳裏聽音樂，跳舞，喝咖啡，而一些不覺得你所乘的這隻郵船正在黑夜裏繼續它底航程的時候，你可曾想到海濱上默默地幫助着你們的燈塔，和燈塔裏面孤的守夜人？</p>
<p>５　蛾和螢</p>
<p>夏夜的油燈旁常有一隻美麗的銀白色的飛蛾，環繞着抖顫着的燈火。</p>
<p>飛蛾先前也許停在什麼　不見的角落裏，一看見火光，他從黑暗裏飛過來了，繞着淡黃色的燈火，飛着，飛着，飛近了。</p>
<p>終於，嗤的一聲，燈火亮了一下，飛蛾掙扎了幾下被燒着了的雙翼，最後，再沒有力量，於是靜靜地躺在碗心的燈油裏了，一動也不動地，讓油浸透了銀白色的雙翼和身軀。</p>
<p>可憐的殉身者呵！你滿懷熱情和喜悅飛向燈光，却讓燈光毀毀滅了目已</p>
<p>我又想起另一種夏夜的英雄，螢火虫，幼年時常是央求着大人想法子捉來放在紗袋喪，唱着：</p>
<p>大麥楷，小麥楷，</p>
<p>聲火虫兒飛下來！</p>
<p>不打你，不罵你，</p>
<p>玩玩就放你。</p>
<p>於是老年人爲我說了一則有人用螢囊讀書的故事。——那是用來當燈的。</p>
<p>飛蛾渴望着燈光，因此在火裏犧牲了自已，這是一個美麗的故事。但螢火虫，多悽慘的遭遇喲！牠爲人們帶來了光，甚至还帮助了淸塞的士子在夏夜裏讀書，然而人們却拿牠關在紗袋裏，牠自已又何嘗見到那一點的光？</p>
<p>６　尾聲</p>
<p>夢醒了，伴着我的還是一燈如豆。</p>
<p>有人說燈是光明的象徵。可是，先生，我是一個平凡的人，在面前這微弱的燈光下，我並沒想到這些。枯坐了這許多時候，我只是感到那個普浴米修士盜來的聖火也曾燃起了心頭的溫暖。雖是寂寞，然而有燈在陪着我。我想起那個小城裏的更夫丁貴的話：</p>
<p>「有它在，我什麽也不怕的。」</p>
<p>讓我加一些香油，換一根燈草，再向你說錢支燈的故事吧。……</p>
<h3 id="c41">雨夜 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>是一個雨夜，傾盆的大雨在窗外　瀝漸瀝地下着，室中蘊藏着潮悶的氣氛，使人感到很不舒暢，似乎就要窒息的樣子。那書案上伏坐個年的十餘歲的孩子，他在朗朋的唸書；桌旁沙發裏斜瞞着他的祖父－一個　髮蟠然的老人－在那和藹的老臉上，堆着靜聆書聲的表情。</p>
<p>「世乃有無母之人，天乎痛哉！」那書聲到這裏便戛然停止了。老人彷彿有所悵觴似的，却長長的嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「爺爺！我的功課已溢習過了，您的故事，也可開始了吧？」孩子把椅子移到老人跟前說。</p>
<p>「故事？什麽故事？」老人有些心不在焉。</p>
<p>「爺爺！　天天這時候，講故事我聽的，怎麼今天忘了？」孩子補充道</p>
<p>「唔……故事！好！就把它當故事說吧……孩子！這個故事，你聽了可別給忘了，應該永久的記在心裏，心的深處才好！」老人自言自語又似恍然地回答。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？爺爺！」孩子好奇的問。</p>
<p>「這因爲……哦！你聽我講吧！快別打岔。」</p>
<p>十年前，也是這樣的雨夜，這屋子裏曾經發生一段故事。老人仍坐在沙發上，他跟前不是孩子，而是孩子的爸爸，一個風流成性的中年人，老人怒氣冲冲的說：</p>
<p>「你是爲她來做說客的嗎？別想！」他霍地站起來：「你得知道，她害的是癆病，是要傳染人的，尤其是孩子，若不與她隔離，豈不太危險？何况狄們只有一個孩子！再說，她不過是你的小妾罷了，値得這末重視？」</p>
<p>「爸爸！她祇要見孩子一面，就是死也瞑目了。求求您……求……」</p>
<p>「別多嚕囌了，去你的吧！」老人把中年人一拖，自已運目的走了。</p>
<p>「唉！遇着這樣頑固的爸爸，叫人多爲難…」那中年人哭喪着臉向外奔去，兀自不覺風雨的侵襲</p>
<p>深晚，雨下得更大了。醫院的病房裏，躺着個將死的病婦，中年人走近床沿低下頭靠着枯槁的臉寵說：</p>
<p>「雯！請你原諒，爸爸不許，他把孩子藏了起來，我找不着，跟他說，又不講理－」病婦厭煩地睜開微弱的雙眼，瞪視着中年人半　，接着她那乾　的嘴唇上張動着，似乎要說話，却發不出聲來－最後咽了氣，左眼還沒合呢！</p>
<p>「雯！你怎麽啦！爲什麽不說話？爲……」中年人瘋狂地搖撼着病婦的屍體，大哭大嚷起來。終於被護士院役們半騙帶拖的　出病房。</p>
<p>從此，那中年人便被送進瘋人院，不久也追隨他的愛伴去了。</p>
<p>「現在祗留下那個沒爸沒媽的孩子，很可憐地跟着他年老的爺爺過活！是我－不！是那老人不好，爲什麽不放她們母子最後一見？」老人說完「故事」凄然地發表他個人的</p>
<p>「那末！爺爺我的媽，是不是就是那個可憐的病婦？」是孩子的詰問。</p>
<p>「…………」老人再也回答不出了，他那蒼老而淸瘦的面上，突然掛着二朶汨珠，是悲哀？還是懺悔？</p>
<h3 id="c42">給將畢業的朋友 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>世界上的人們往往喜後悔。那個大秦的宰相李斯，臨死時在咸陽市上，還念念不忘於一隻打獵時的兔子。蕭伯納以爲人先得跳到人生的盡頭，再回轉來體味，其實還是一句笑話。而你，在行將戴方帽子的時候，也正想「再回去體味大學一年級時候的樂趣」，好誠然是好的，可是，懊悔又有什麼用？何况，即使你現在再做一回Freshman，你又打算怎麽樣？我要再問一句，懊悔又有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>不錯，「畢業即失業」這句老調「至今還存在着它的力量」，「所學非所用的」也不僅僅：是你底朋友C.H.W.T.L……而已。成千成百的Sorien們，都在爲這個陰影痛苦着，煩惱着。成千成萬的大學畢業生也在懊悔爲什麽當初要騐那些和現在的職業毫不相關的課程。也正有成千成萬的Freshman　Sophomove　Jonior們將走上這條泥濘的路。感到陰沉的何止你一個人？</p>
<p>爲此，你該拿這看做大家的事。</p>
<p>然而大家有時候是並沒想到這些的，這就是說，擺在人們眼前的，也還有一些美麗的幻夢，爲了這幻夢他們不惜以大量的金錢，時間，和精力去換取一紙文憑；一頂帽子，和一個頭銜，雖然明知道那是夢幻，然而仍然是要這樣做，這就是說，在沒有辦法的時候，夢也是好的。</p>
<p>魯迅先生在「娜拉走後怎樣「裏曾說過，假使沒有一條路，那還不如讓人們做夢下去，不要去喊醒他們，因爲從夢裏回到現實的痛苦是更大的。而你，却將那些沉在夢幻裏的人喊醒了，可是，喊醒了以後却沒有一條路可走，碰來碰去都是遭受同樣命遝的人，於是，沒有痛苦的人開始發現痛苦，而已經有痛苦的人却是更痛苦。</p>
<p>可是，這並非說是甘於做夢，或者是勸人們對血淋淋的現實不加以正視。正視現實仍然是必需而且至最要緊的，而如今，誰能知道等到你畢業時候將會遇到些什麼，或者是怎樣的一個世界。我們還不知道明天戶口米會不會發，幹嗎要想得那麼遠？</p>
<p>這也並不是說「船到橋頭自然直」，或者是混一天算一天，實在是多想也於事無補的。前面說過，這不是你一個人的事，是大家的事，是一個非常大的問題。憑我們這一點力量，是沒法解決的。就如你吧，提示了這末一個問題，算是對人們來一次呼號，可是，這又能够改變我們這社會的幾分之幾？</p>
<p>我們這社會就是這末一個社會，在沒有澈底地改革以前，即使有十分之一的大學畢業生用到他們的「所學」，即使－再來一個即使吧－每個畢業生都找到他的職業，你說，能在這末一個社會裏起多少作用？</p>
<p>再說一遍，這原是大家的事。</p>
<p>爲此，在如今，煩惱和痛苦都是多餘的，還是安心在自已底本位上吧!</p>

<h3 id="c43">評述中北華聯大戰 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>第三屆籃球聯賽，因塲地關係，急需月內結束。故日來天天舉行，忙極一時。目下甲甲組僅餘中北華聯之戰，其第一循環之補賽，巳於昨日下午六時，在舊西靑球房舉行。當局因鑒於秩序之難於維持，爲限制觀衆，臨時增高票價爲樓上五百元，樓下二千元，且規定張數。但球迷並不以價昻而稍受影響者，全部售罄，向隅者何止千人。其吸引力之大，於此可見。旣因票數有嚴格之規定，故塲內除應有坐位，並無空隙外，無擁擠之現象，誠最標準之現象。茲先列該組形勢表，再記述昨日之戰程加以評語：</p>
<p>以上列形勢表觀，中北賴昨戰之力克華聯，乃得獨佔鰲首。以後尙有第二循環之相逢，華聯還有一機會也。按中北爲滬上之唯一北派球隊，華聯則年來在籃壇享譽甚盛，昨賽又有最滿意之收穫，故此一塲精彩之南北大戰，不暗裏煩詳叙過程於次。</p>
<p>裁判劉荷生楊烈誠召兩方隊長汪仲陶孔廣益握手爲禮，擇定地位後，中圈跳球，雙方對圓陣線如此。</p>
<p>勃脫（華聯鋒）　瞿錫麟（華聯衛）</p>
<p>李震中（中北衛）　沈　恭（中北條）</p>
<p>吳成章（華聯鋒）</p>
<p>陳學崇（中北鋒）</p>
<p>徐菊生（華聯鋒）　張康雄（華聯衛）</p>
<p>卓國榮（中北衛　）趙雅林（中北鋒）</p>
<p>盡球藝之表演　有理想之收獲</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>雙方均採人釘人，故如上捉對廝殺。震中先試不中，錫麟遠射亦失的，學崇中央讓騙中反手鵠中，成章犯規，學崇未中，中北先開紀錄。再攻，學崇再施故技，成章依舊犯規，兩罰未中。靈中竄進，被阻於良雄但拉手犯規，震中一罰中的，三對〇佔先。但是時雙方極現混亂，中北呼暫停。華聯亦乘機調下吳成章，范慶公進塲看趙雅林，良雄守學崇，乃華聯預定之計劃。勃脫又犯規，震中再成功，四對〇。良雄兩記浪擲，華聯急呼暫停，以資鎭靜。果然菊生在阿卓犯規中兩擲中的，再遠射一球，四對四平手，此爲昨戰唯一之平等分數。此後中北突見活躍，阿車左手撩進，聲勢一壯，瞬間加上五分，華聯再以孔廣益調下慶公，藉取與雅林之猛將勇拚，但仍未見得手中北分數扶搖滅而上，由十二對五，而十七對九，直至上半時終了時，阿卓犯規，勃脫罰進，比數爲中北十九，華聯十二，相關七分。</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>休息時間，汪仲陶張溎祥各授錦囊妙計，胸有成竹，再行交手，形勢如前。學崇裝腔作勢先探一籃，此時菊生最圖活躍，以致阿卓犯規累累，在中北以二五對十四領前時，阿卓以四次犯規離場，由包松圓入替。華聯乘對方陣脚未穩之際，菊生勃脫左右逢源，頃刻間追至二十一對二十五，相　僅兩球矣。中北不得不再呼暫停，以殺共氣，此時雙方各盡球　，演出緊張，得米曾有，二十七對二十二。雅林下野，李寳中入替，乃陷於苦戰中。至最後七分鐘時，華聯以二十五對二十九落後時，良雄錫麟均失可進不進之球四隻之多反爲學崇反身成功。於此奠定勝敗局面，其殆亦命也，最後結果，中北終以三十二對二十入勝華聯兩球，中北果然成功，華聯雖敗亦榮，附兩軍功表：</p>
<p>中北　犯　分</p>
<p>趙雅林　二　三</p>
<p>陳學崇　一　一二</p>
<p>沈羣恭　三　三</p>
<p>李震中　三　九</p>
<p>李　中　一　一</p>
<p>卓國榮　四　三</p>
<p>包松圓　一　一</p>
<p>合計　一五　三二</p>
<p>華聯　犯　分</p>
<p>勃脫　四　一〇</p>
<p>吳成章　二　〇</p>
<p>張良雄　四　三</p>
<p>徐菊生　三　八</p>
<p>范慶公　二　〇</p>
<p>瞿錫麟　二　五</p>
<p>全長春　一　〇</p>
<p>孔廣益　二　二</p>
<p>合計　二〇　二八</p>
<h3 id="c44">兩隊俱見成功　均採人釘人制 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>我人不能以成敗論英雄，觀乎兩隊昨戰之全賽過程而言，俱在球藝方面發展。即此一點，已稱成功。評中北之所以能勝，一在經騐，二則調度有方，故指導之重要，固亦不亞臨陣之將士。以阿卓守菊生，爲有見識之措置。蓋包松圓雖有精湛之球藝，但對活潑之菊生，必有失誤之點。在阿卓罰出後，已可鑒到。至中北之大功臣，當爲震中與學崇。前者仍爲一隊靈魂，連緊攻守，有以利賴，學崇雖多無的放矢。但其站立中路之反身，使看守者犯規，允稱使對手寒心也。餘如賴隊員之身材高大，籃下球，均能獲得，多獲球權，即多攻勢，多攻勢，勝利機會自多，此亦爲中北所以勝之一大原因也。</p>
<p>華聯昨敗之最大原因，上半時失分過多，及張良雄之過於緊張。按張亦屬獲分之一員。昨射籃機會亦多，惜俱因操之過急，射必彈出，如能稍事鎭靜，則攻獲自佳。勃脫攻則有餘，守尙不足，無謂之犯規又多，其或因不熟稔震中之球路所致。錫麟守羣恭，自稱相當成功，但其亦爲聿恭釘住，未能試其遠射。論之，則功多過少，　　恭乃中北獲分之　也。華聯昨果敗矣，但演出極合理想，可爲成功之作。</p>
<p>談雙方戰術，巳均採人釘人制，捉對廝殺，絕不放鬆看守之人，盡其本職，鏡頭奇佳，但余頗覺彼此對擋人及交換看人一點，極少利用，否則必更有美妙之塲面，蓋死釘太費力，且地位稍差，便是漏洞，在必要時及地位關係，應取交換看人。現第一戰中北如願以償，下次再相逢時，華聯必有更新之進展，以圖復仇，而中北再接再厲，以求獲得錦標，應無異疑，預測將更能吸人入勝也。</p>

<p>（戊）其他个人進攻基本技術</p>
<p>籃球運動，除接球，傳球。投籃及拍球，爲其主要基本動作外，尙有其他如起動，停住，旋轉，阻擋及虛裝等動作，亦甚重要。在比賽中除有果敢勇猛之戰鬥精神外，更須有運用此等基本動作之天才；有天才之球員，固然易奏升堂入室之境。惟缺乏天才之人，若能對各種基本技術，不斷加以硏究與苦練，未始無登大雅之望，故下列各種基本動作，實不可不留意熟習之。</p>
<p>（一）起動　－能起動（即起跑）迅速之球員，常能進攻對方之不備，及躱避逃脫敵方之嚴密防守，即傳球與投籃，亦更見敏捷，動作益覺機警。常見球員因起動遲鈍，以致失去良機，易爲人所監視。起動之正確姿勢，兩足應前後分立，相距約一英尺，左右相距與肩同闊度，身體略向前彎，頭向前視，兩臂左右半曲垂前，身體須平衡，重心略置在前或後一足上，以備隨時可以起動。　　（二）停住</p>
<p>能起跑得快，必須要能停信得速，方能在千軍厲馬中，急速應付自如，尤其是球握在手中之時。停住方法，可有兩種。一爲在疾走中。欲停住時身體稍躍起，使兩足一齊離地，隨即以前足板光觸地，屈膝停住，身體向前略彎。若　球在手中，則須放在腹間，以便行旋轉，傳球，或投籃等動作。一爲平常停住法，即在走動中，欲停時，即將前一足放閣踏前一步，後足則稍彎曲，以支持身體重量，球着握在手中，即須放在腹間掩護。倘欲於停住後旋轉，必須用前一足移動，以免犯持球行走之弊。此二種停住法，可聯合走步，旋轉，及跳起等動作練習。</p>
<p>（三）旋轉　旋轉與拍球，可說是籃球運動中，一種極美妙之動作，此二種動作，不是自然演變產生出來的，而是經過許多前　指導員及聰明球員，運用思想發明的，自此兩種動作訓練成熟之後，籃球進攻技術，突然改觀，不若從前之進攻呆板。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops in Luzon Complete Initial Preparations; Implement Human Bullet Attacks, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces on the Luzon front have completed their initial operations. Except for Manila and Corregidor Island, the situation is gradually becoming stagnant. The Japanese army is implementing its favored human bullet attacks to engage the enemy's artillery fire, inflicting heavy damage. There have been no major changes in the Lingayen area. Enemy motor vehicle transport in the areas of Magumin and San Jose is becoming more frequent. On the high ground south of Rosales and east of Sison, the enemy has continued to attack since dawn on the 19th. Japanese forces repelled them, firmly holding their established positions. Japanese forces also bombed and burned enemy supply depots south of San Jose; the large fire could be seen from afar. Near Nikolas, the enemy attacked the Japanese forward base with two battalions. After a counterattack by Japanese assault troops, they retreated. In the past two weeks, twenty groups of Japanese assault troops have killed or wounded 1,216 American soldiers, destroyed twelve cargo vehicles, seven heavy howitzers, nine mortars, fourteen machine guns, and seven rapid-firing guns. They also seized a considerable amount of ammunition and supplies, including four radios and automatic rifles. In the Xunban area, Japanese forces encircled the right flank of the enemy invading the northern part of the area and launched successive attacks. The Japanese artillery demonstrated its power and achieved considerable results. At the same time, the Japanese air force coordinated with the ground forces, making a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Lingayen and the enemy supply depot in San Fabian on the night of the 20th. Three airfields were burned, and the supply depots caught fire and exploded. After completing their mission, all Japanese aircraft safely returned. The fierce fighting in the Clark area continues, with no change in the front line. The Luzon battle is now gestating the next opportunity. It remains to be seen whether the enemy will engage the Japanese army in mountain warfare or adopt a defensive strategy, which is worthy of close attention.</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Corregidor Island was under heavy smoke on the 22nd due to intense enemy artillery fire and bombing. Communication has been cut off, but the Japanese garrison on the island appears to be still fighting bravely. Enemy ships have still been unable to enter Manila Bay. On the 22nd and 23rd, enemy artillery fire against the old city of Manila and the southern Japanese garrison was particularly intense. The enemy troops surrounding the Japanese army have reinforced their troops and firepower, but the Japanese soldiers are undeterred and continue to fight them in a bloody battle. The Japanese naval forces launched a heroic all-out assault operation against the enemy positions near the coast of Bacoor on the night of the 21st. A group from another naval assault team fiercely engaged the enemy near the presidential palace in hand-to-hand combat. The University of the Philippines was bombed by enemy forces on the 22nd, and the National General Hospital also fell into enemy hands on the same day. Two truckloads of young men and women in the hospital were abducted despite the families' pleas, revealing the bestial behavior of the American enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Battle for Iwo Jima Shifts to Screen Rock; Japanese Forces on Mount Suribachi Secure Positions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Due to the fierce counterattacks by Japanese forces, the enemy forces advancing to the front of the Japanese positions in the Iwo Jima offensive and defensive battle have been unable to advance or retreat in the western part, Chishima village, and the central area. The enemy has been forced to retreat. Despite investing enormous manpower and equipment, the enemy continues to attack stubbornly, but the losses have increased drastically with each Japanese counterattack. On the morning of the 23rd, enemy ships around the island, while conducting intense artillery fire, also launched a land attack on the area of Screen Rock, 300 meters southeast of Motoyama Airfield. By noon, a portion of the enemy forces finally occupied Screen Rock. After reinforcing troops, the Japanese forces immediately launched a fierce attack, retaking Screen Rock by 1:30 PM. Although the enemy forces advancing on the left flank continued to attack fiercely, the Japanese army continued to secure its positions, preventing the enemy from invading, and even launched a raid into the enemy's position on the night of the 23rd. As such, the battle on the island has focused on the south side of Screen Rock. The southern part of Motoyama Airfield has been completely destroyed and turned into a wasteland because the enemy has bombarded the area with 30,000 naval artillery shells daily. In addition, the Japanese forces on Mount Suribachi continued to attack the enemy fiercely on the 22nd and 23rd, securing their main positions and engaging in fierce fighting. Since the morning of the 23rd, the waves around the island have been strong, hindering the movement of enemy ships and delaying landing operations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese garrison's artillery positions on Iwo Jima concentrated their fire on the enemy forces in the Chishima Airfield and the area south of the airfield twice on the 23rd, at 9:00 AM and around 1:00 PM. As a result, the enemy forces in that area suffered heavy casualties, and the supply warehouses in the vicinity were also destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in significant losses for the enemy.</p>
<p>Enemy Casualties Exceed Four Thousand</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces on the Iwo Jima front continue to secure positions everywhere, and the morale of the soldiers is increasingly high, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. According to foreign dispatches on the 22nd, the enemy announced casualties of 3,650, which increased to 4,500 by the 23rd, demonstrating the extent of their sacrifice. The enemy has landed three divisions, deploying such a large force on a coastal position of only two kilometers between the South Embankment and Chishima Village, causing them to fall into chaos after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. The Mount Suribachi position, which the enemy is eager to seize, remains in Japanese hands, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Every Japanese soldier, from commanders to privates, is determined to defend the position to the death. For example, Lieutenant Nakamura of the rapid-firing artillery unit single-handedly destroyed more than twenty enemy tanks, and he received commendation on the 23rd, which was reported to the Emperor, showing the bravery of all personnel. Especially on the afternoon of the 21st at 5:50 PM, more than ten large fires were seen far away on the southeastern horizon due to the suicide bombing by the Kamikaze Special Attack Team, greatly boosting morale. From the night of the 21st to dawn on the 22nd, each front line launched courageous raids against the enemy, inflicting particularly heavy damage.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Front, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces in the southern part of Iwo Jima launched two raids against the enemy's southern landing points on the night of the 22nd, killing or wounding more than one hundred enemy soldiers in the first raid and more than two hundred in the second. They launched another attack on the night of the 23rd, destroying four tanks and wounding more than four hundred enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Favorable for Defense, Unfavorable for Attack; U.S. Forces Suffer Heavy Casualties <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to an announcement by the Nimitz Command on the 23rd, U.S. forces have suffered a total of 5,372 casualties in the battle for Iwo Jima. The announcement stated that as of 6:00 PM on the 21st, the losses were 4,554, and have since increased by 810 in the past two days. Furthermore, United Press correspondents at the front also reported that since the start of the landing operation on the 19th, the U.S. Navy has been losing an average of three men per minute. The loss of 3,000 troops during the 72-hour battle for Tarawa Island was already considered the most intense battle in the Pacific, but judging by the battle of Iwo Jima, one can imagine the fierce and arduous fighting on the island, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. It is also reported that Commander Dana of the landing operation on the island lamented during a meeting with reporters that Iwo Jima is the most favorable island in the world for defense, and unfavorable for attack.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Launch Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A United Press correspondent reported on the 23rd the battle for Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima as follows: When approaching the Japanese positions, they were attacked by fierce artillery fire from the Japanese army, which showed the extremely high morale of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers who were chased into caves like rats in a bag refused to surrender. At the same time, some jumped off cliffs to commit suicide, and others were forced to the top of the mountain and threw themselves into the volcanic crater, making it impossible to attack. It was also reported that the flanks of the U.S. forces attacking the central airfield were counterattacked by the Japanese army and could only advance with great difficulty. The U.S. forces on the left flank were ambushed by Japanese mortar fire twice on the 22nd, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, the right flank was also counterattacked by the Japanese army, leading to a chaotic battle. On the night of the 22nd, Japanese naval forces suddenly raided the rear of the U.S. positions on the west coast and launched courageous attacks, killing many enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Government Decides to Establish Wartime Construction Corps to Fully Utilize Domestic Construction Capacity <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to establish a wartime posture for civilian construction projects and fully utilize domestic construction capacity, the Japanese government has decided to establish a special legal entity called the Wartime Construction Corps (provisional name). The "Draft Plan for Establishing a Wartime Construction Organization" was approved by the cabinet on the 23rd. The purpose of the plan is to concentrate existing construction capacity on essential construction projects and dissolve the existing Civil Engineering and Construction Control Association. Based on Article 18 of the National General Mobilization Law, a special legal entity called the Wartime Construction Corps will be established as a simple and powerful guiding and governing agency, with regional sub-corps set up in each local administrative council district. All contracting, allocation, supervision, and promotion of projects will be entirely handled by the sub-corps.</p>
<h3 id="e5">A Glimpse of the Fourth District of Nanhui <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District of Nanhui County is located in the northernmost part of Nanhui County and was formerly known as "Yuanbeishi." It borders the suburbs of Shanghai to the northwest, Chuansha to the east, and the Fifth District to the south. Because Nanhui County was included in the first phase of the Qingxiang movement, while Zhangjiangzhai in the Fourth District was included in the third phase, its blockade line is located on the border between the Fourth and Fifth Districts, with two major inspection stations, Yujiaqiao and Sunxiaoqiao, set up to check travelers to prevent banditry.</p>
<p>The entire district has fourteen townships and a population of 60,086, making it the most densely populated district after Zhoupu in the Fifth District. Most residents are engaged in agriculture, but farmers in the northwest are mainly engaged in vegetable gardening. Because the district is close to Shanghai, it is easier for residents to earn a living, and their living conditions are more prosperous than other districts. The cultural level of the residents is higher than other regions due to the presence of many schools and its proximity to Shanghai. However, due to the frequent local incidents, most of those with some education have developed outwards, making the local facilities more backward than before.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation in the district, rivers other than the Lujia Port and Changtang Rivers, which flow into the Bailianjing and connect to the Xiepu River, are few, narrow, and overflowing, making navigation difficult. However, the district roads are crisscrossed and paved with gravel, which is rare elsewhere. According to a resident of the district who spoke to a reporter, the Tangnan Highway (from Pudong Tangqiao to Nanhui) was built in 1937. At that time, the market was booming due to the convenience of the highway. Unfortunately, construction was halted due to the incident, and the roadbed has collapsed, making it deserted, and the situation is far from what it used to be.</p>
<p>Security Situation</p>
<p>The security situation in the district is better than other districts because it is located in the far north and close to Shanghai, making it difficult for large bands of bandits to gain a foothold. The military strength in the entire district is also strong, with the Fourth Company of the Provincial Security Training Regiment and two companies of armed police stationed there to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Although the security in the district is satisfactory, there are still many areas for improvement. In particular, the agencies responsible for inspecting travelers pay less attention to their responsibilities and create difficulties for goods passing through, causing much resentment among the people. It is hoped that the authorities will make improvements in the future.</p>
<p>Scenery of the Vegetable Market</p>
<p>Because the northwestern part of the Fourth District borders Shanghai, many residents are engaged in vegetable gardening. Farmers supply the Shanghai market with chives in spring, garlic in summer, vegetables in autumn, and spinach in winter, continuously throughout the year. Around 3:00 PM every day, the vegetable market is crowded with people, young and old alike. The sounds of weighing, inspecting goods, bargaining, and shouting can be heard simultaneously, and the bustling scene is impossible to describe in full detail with a pen.</p>
<p>Since winter began, the weather has been very cold. The vegetables planted in the fields have been repeatedly hit by cold waves, and more than half of them have been damaged by frost. Although the remaining vegetables have been carefully protected by the farmers, their number is small. In addition, there are many checkpoints for transporting goods to Shanghai, and money is required at every step. The commission is also heavy (10% of the value). Therefore, when the vegetables arrive in Shanghai and are sold to the citizens, their price has almost doubled compared to the original price. No wonder vegetable prices in Shanghai are so high.</p>
<p>Prosperity of Beicai</p>
<p>Before the incident, Beicai was a small town, and commerce was not developed. After the war shifted westward, most of the essence of the southern city was destroyed. In addition, the waterways were not open, and the entry and exit of goods were severely restricted, resulting in a surge in smuggling. Single-person merchants flocked to this place to sell daily necessities. In addition, the Shanghai market suffered from a shortage of supplies, causing panic in the market. Therefore, the rice market and salt market in the area emerged in response to the situation. According to investigations, there are more than ten black market oversight sites in the area. Rice shops are lined up side by side, and men and women carrying goods rub shoulders, resembling a grand gathering. It is reported that</p>
<p>There is one middle school and one primary school in the area. The middle school is private and only has two grades with more than fifty students. The expenses are covered by tuition fees and donations from Shanghai gentry and merchants. The primary school is county-run and has nine classrooms with more than five hundred students. The reporter arrived during the holidays and was unable to investigate the details.</p>
<p>The current District Head, Huang Yiping, has been in office for just over a month. He has good connections with local township chiefs and local gentry, so his facilities are more successful than those of his predecessors. It is hoped that Mr. Huang will continue to work hard and not have the mentality of a "five-day Beijing mayor" (the district head of the district has been changing frequently), and serve the local community.</p>
<p>When the reporter returned to Zhoupu, the setting sun was shining, and the white snow was like catkins, making the reporter feel relaxed and refreshed. It was already night when I arrived at Zhoupu.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Forces on Saipan, Agiguan, and Other Islands Bravely Launch Operations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a United Press dispatch from Agiguan Island, Japanese soldiers on the islands in the Pacific occupied by U.S. forces are still bravely launching guerrilla warfare under difficult conditions. The report on the 23rd stated: The Pacific front has now shifted to Iwo Jima. Although some time has passed since the U.S. forces occupied the area, fighting continues on the islands behind the front line. Japanese forces are still hiding on Saipan, Tinian, Agiguan, and Peleliu Islands. Although Saipan Island has been turned into a B-29 base, a U.S. black unit engaged in fierce fighting with 350 Japanese soldiers on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, resulting in casualties for the U.S. side.</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Battle of Iwo Jima <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>– Ying Ming</p>
<p>It has been three weeks since the American enemy began to invade Manila on February 3. However, until now, the American enemy, despite having paid a huge price in sacrifices, still cannot completely occupy Manila. The so-called pacification of Luzon Island and the end of the Philippine war are obviously still far away, which shows the anxiety and embarrassment of the American enemy.</p>
<p>In an attempt to cover up the setbacks in the Philippine war centered on Manila and to try new adventures, the American enemy has recently spared no expense in invading Iwo Jima, which belongs to the territory of Japan. The enemy forces began to actively carry out landing activities around Iwo Jima on the 16th, and officially landed on the 19th.</p>
<p>While carrying out the landing on Iwo Jima, the American enemy also threatened the Ogasawara Islands northeast of Iwo Jima and further harassed the southeastern coastal areas of Honshu, Japan. On the 16th and 17th, they even dispatched a mobile unit composed mainly of more than ten aircraft carriers, which appeared in the southeastern coastal waters of Muzhou, using carrier-based aircraft to bomb the Kanto and Chubu regions. This bombing was not only aimed at general military transportation facilities, but also seemed to focus on the Japanese air force bases on the southeastern coast of Muzhou, revealing their great ambition.</p>
<p>Iwo Jima is only a small island of eight kilometers long and four kilometers wide. Together with some other small islands, it is also called the Iwo Islands. Iwo Jima is located in the middle of the Mariana Islands and the southeastern part of Honshu, Japan, about 600 nautical miles from Yokohama and Guam, 900 nautical miles west from Taiwan, and slightly northeast of the Ogasawara Islands.</p>
<p>The purpose of the American enemy's invasion of Iwo Jima is certainly not just to cover up the setbacks in the Manila war. It has the ambition to occupy Iwo Jima and then make greater adventures in other places. The American enemy believes that the Iwo Islands and Ogasawara Islands are strategically important. They are now the outpost of Japan from southeastern Honshu to the Taiwan area. To advance further, they must first occupy this outpost, Iwo Jima. Iwo Jima gives the American enemy's naval and air force operations a great restraint. For example, enemy aircraft flying from the Mariana Islands base to bomb Japan are often detected and intercepted by the Japanese air reconnaissance unit on Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>The intention of the American enemy is to gain a foothold in the Iwo Jima area, threaten Honshu to the north, invade the East China Sea to the west, and then join forces with the troops advancing north from the Philippines to threaten the Chinese coast, that is, to prepare for the so-called mainland operation.</p>
<p>According to news from Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, the American enemy fleet in the Pacific under the command of Nimitz is divided into three teams. The first team cruises in the coastal waters of Japan, the second team is operating in the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Islands area, and the third team is in the Philippine sea area. The mobile unit that harassed the southeastern sea of Honshu, Japan on the 16th and 17th is said to belong to the first team.</p>
<p>The battle of Iwo Jima is in progress. The Japanese military's resistance is extremely strong. To date, more than 30,000 enemy troops have landed, but at least one-third of them have been annihilated by the Japanese army. It is said that the losses and sacrifices in this enemy landing battle on Iwo Jima are far more severe than in the past landings on Tarawa, Tinian, and the Marshall Islands. Although Iwo Jima is small in area, its capacity for burying enemy troops is very large. Undoubtedly, all the American enemy's wishful thinking will end in a disastrous defeat. The closer the war gets to the Japanese mainland, the stronger Japan's defense and the greater the enemy's difficulties. Our ally has not only already established a strong defense on the mainland, which will make the American enemy flinch, but also completed a comprehensive defense posture on the Chinese mainland. If the enemy invades, they will be severely beaten.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Governor Lin of Anhui Province recently came to Nanjing to report to the central government. The reporter, knowing that Mr. Lin is the Secretary-General of the New Movement Association, specifically asked for his opinion on the future direction of the New Movement and the issue of opium eradication. The answers were as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the focus of promoting the New Movement today? (Answer) The focus of promoting the New Movement today is in the countryside, training farmers everywhere to be able to govern and defend themselves, increase production, and subsidize education. (Question) After taking charge of Anhui, how will you promote the New Movement in Anhui Province? (Answer) To mobilize and coordinate with the party, government, and military to promote it together, it is expected that the strength will be increased. (Question) It seems that there is no major development in promoting the New Movement in various places. What is the reason? (Answer) The reason is that the county magistrates are busy with their official duties and have no time to take care of it. Also, some county magistrates do not understand the New Movement very well, which affects development. (Question) Are the chairmen and members of the New Movement branch associations in various counties concurrently held by the county magistrates? (Answer) If they are held concurrently by the county magistrates, there will be no cooperation. (Question) Is there a good way? (Answer) Only by asking the Central Youth Cadre School of the New Movement Association to train more New Movement youth cadres and send them to various places to assist the county magistrates, specializing in promoting the New Movement. (Question) What is the knowledge of the New Movement among young people in Anhui? (Answer) They already have considerable knowledge. (Question) People who have recently returned from Anhui Province said that the New Movement has made significant progress in Anhui, perhaps because the governor has always been responsible for the New Movement. It is expected that other provinces will definitely be able to follow suit, and the promotion of the New Movement in various provinces may be more active. (Answer) Yes. (Question) There are many opium-producing areas in Anhui, and there are many smokers. I wonder what your policies are for opium eradication? (Answer) The Opium Eradication Implementation Committee has already been established, and I serve as the chairman. The committee has five groups: general affairs, opium planting prohibition, opium transportation prohibition, opium smoking prohibition, and inspection. The main purpose is to implement the opium eradication plan. Regarding the elimination of opium addiction, on the 11th of this month, due to the joint request of young comrades and military police officers to report, I specifically ordered Wu Linzhi, the director of the police affairs office, to conduct a general opium and narcotics inspection with the commander of the Seventh Regiment, along with the military police and youth league members. Dozens of opium dens were found in various districts, and the situation was quite good. In short, I will take Bengbu as an absolute opium-free zone and start from there to eliminate opium addiction throughout the province in the shortest possible time, sweep away the national shame of opium, and comfort Chairman Wang in heaven with Chairman Chen's continued vigorous opium eradication policy.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – As the Greater East Asia War enters its final decisive phase, China's role in the war becomes increasingly important. Consolidating the rear and supporting the front requires stabilizing the people's livelihood and ensuring the smooth completion of public security work. Therefore, since the Greater East Asia War, the National Government's policies have focused on these two major goals. These two policies are mutually supportive and cannot be neglected. On the 12th of this month, to stabilize the people's livelihood, the government issued emergency measures to suppress prices. To discuss ensuring public security work, a military leaders' conference was held on the 23rd and 24th of this month, gathering responsible military leaders from across the country to exchange ideas. Through these two days of intensive discussions, thorough measures have been taken regarding future public security policies. There is no doubt that local public security will become increasingly clear in the future.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing Military Council announced on the 22nd that two Japanese units were advancing westward from Saiqing in Hunan Province. One unit has reached a point twelve kilometers northwest of the city. Baoqing is a key stronghold on the western side of the Japanese corridor between China and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Zurich, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has announced that American bombers and submarines in the Pacific have repeatedly sunk Japanese ships full of American prisoners. Neutral countries believe this is either anti-Axis propaganda or suspect that Japan is deliberately sinking the ships and massacring prisoners. However, a Washington dispatch on the 22nd conveyed the story of survivors from an American ship that sank in the Philippine Sea last December, carrying 1,500 American prisoners. This testimony confirms past rumors. Reuters also reported that this is the third time a prisoner transport ship has been sunk by the US military in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports that a German military spokesman stated yesterday that enemy forces launched a large-scale attack in the sector between Roermond and Aachen. They have established small bridgeheads several kilometers deep in Gevenich, Selgersdorf, and Birgden. General Simpson's troops have crossed the Ruhr River and reached the outskirts of Düren. Fighting is intense along the entire front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports that the Anti-Axis offensive on the Ruhr front has entered a critical stage. The breaching of the Ruhr River dams has delayed the Anti-Axis advance, benefiting German preparations on the Western Front and potentially easing the overall situation. The Anti-Axis reluctance to shift the focus of their offensive away from Aachen is also due to the difficulty of moving supplies, and the enemy's attack points were anticipated by the German forces. The areas near Linnich and Düren are clearly the focal points of the offensive. The US First Army is assisting the Ninth Army's attack, and the British Second Army will also provide support. It is uncertain whether the bulk of the US First Army, currently stationed behind the Ninth Army, will immediately join the battle. The Anti-Axis forces likely aim to break into the Rhine River plain, sweep through the German positions along the Meuse River, and seize the area west of the Rhine before invading the industrial areas on the right bank of the Rhine and the great plains of northern Germany. American material superiority has allowed them to cross the Ruhr River in several locations, approaching the outskirts of Düren, but this is not enough to determine the outcome of the battle. Past experience has shown that the success or failure of a major Anti-Axis offensive cannot be determined solely by the edges of the German defensive zone.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Anti-Axis air forces launched a large-scale bombing campaign against German transportation infrastructure on the 22nd, aiming to paralyze transportation throughout Germany. The air raid was unprecedented. In addition to the British Home Forces, other air forces were mobilized, totaling six thousand aircraft. The bombing tactics were also different from the past, with a large number of planes divided into small formations to bomb various German transportation targets. The raids continued until nightfall. British Mosquito squadrons bombed Berlin, and over two thousand American heavy bombers were deployed during the day.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to foreign news reports, the Turkish government abruptly declared war on Japan and Germany on the 23rd. According to Foreign Minister Saracoğlu's explanation, this was due to pressure from the United Kingdom and the United States. When the Turkish parliament resolved to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Japan on January 3rd of this year, the Turkish Foreign Minister met with the Japanese Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Kurihara, to explain the details of the severance. The Turkish government intended to maintain friendly relations with Japan, but the surrounding circumstances did not allow it. This time, succumbing to the power of the United Kingdom and the United States, they were forced to issue a declaration of war against Japan. In reality, Turkey's participation in the war poses no threat to Japan. Now that a state of war exists, Japan will not hesitate to issue a declaration of war. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has issued a statement expressing Japan's position.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Montevideo, the Uruguayan government declared war on Japan and Germany on the 21st.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Air Defense Headquarters to Hold Joint Air Raid Shelter Construction Week Next Month, Hoping Citizens Will Diligently Build Shelters <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters, in light of the recent attempts by enemy American air forces to disrupt the morale of the peaceful areas by indiscriminately bombing major cities and massacring our people, and considering the actual situation in Hankou and the current air defense situation in this city, believes that the popularization and expansion of air raid shelters is essential. Therefore, it has been decided to implement Air Raid Shelter Construction Week from March 1st to 7th (one week), hoping that every citizen will make every effort to complete the construction of air raid shelters during this construction week to avoid damage from enemy air raids. The Municipal Police Bureau has been instructed to inform all subordinate branches so that the Baojia personnel and the general public thoroughly understand the purpose of this matter and actively complete it in accordance with the implementation measures, or repair and expand them, ensuring that they are properly flawless. Mayor Zhou, concurrently the Minister of the Air Defense Headquarters, issued a statement, hoping that every citizen will do their utmost to realize this plan. The air raid shelter construction methods and Minister Zhou's statement are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Methods</p>
<p>(1) Private vacant land, (2) Public vacant land, (3) Inside houses (must have an exit), (4) Underground or semi-underground air raid shelters with roofs are ideal standards. If it is not possible to install roofs due to lack of materials, hard work, or other reasons, efforts should still be made to gradually install them. (5) All construction costs shall be borne by the builder. (6) The standard capacity is up to fifteen people, and there must be entrances and exits on both sides. (7) If it is a covered type, wood or bamboo with a diameter of three inches or more should be spaced one foot five inches apart to form beams and columns, and covered with thirty centimeters of soil. (8) The entrances and exits must be constructed solidly to withstand the impact of explosions. (9) When building on public vacant land and roads, the Municipal Works Bureau must be consulted to investigate the existence of underground buried objects. However, for Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road, and Great Shanghai Road, the Works Bureau will investigate the existence of such underground buried objects and indicate the locations where construction will not be obstructed. (10) If construction on private vacant land is rejected by the landowner, the branch offices must actively mediate. (11) During the implementation of the Air Raid Shelter Construction Week, personnel selected and assigned by the heads of each branch office should go to the construction sites at any time to provide proper guidance. (12) During the implementation period of the Air Raid Shelter Construction Week, the procedure for obtaining permission from the Works Bureau as stated in Article 9 of this plan may be omitted to reduce citizen hassle and the time required to obtain permission. Citizens should only follow the instructions of the head of the police branch office regarding the suitability of the construction site and do their best to carry out construction. Each branch office must not disappoint the citizens and should investigate whether the construction site is suitable.</p>
<p>Minister's Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the Air Raid Shelter Digging Week planned and implemented by the Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters, Mayor Zhou, in his capacity as Minister, issued the following statement: "It is better to be prepared than sorry" is a well-known saying. Historical facts are sufficient to prove the truth of this statement. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has fully demonstrated its spirit of righteousness in striving for the survival and freedom of the entire East Asia. We are also cooperating with our allies in this critical juncture of life and death. However, the enemy Americans are still fully supporting the Chongqing regime and carrying out indiscriminate bombing in our major cities. This accumulated behavior only causes suffering to the majority of innocent civilians, and good cities are on the verge of destruction. This illegal and inhumane behavior has been fully demonstrated in the indiscriminate bombing of the Hankou area. At this time of decisive battle, enemy air raids on Shanghai are naturally expected. In order to minimize the damage caused by air raids, the Air Defense Headquarters has repeatedly called for the rapid construction of air raid shelters, but the results have not been satisfactory. Judging from the damage caused by recent enemy aircraft bombing and strafing and anti-aircraft artillery fire, it is clear that there is still much room for improvement in air defense facilities. In order to thoroughly promote the construction of air raid shelters for all Shanghai citizens, the Air Defense Authority has specially held Air Raid Shelter Digging Week to awaken the widespread attention and implementation of all citizens. Citizens must know that this measure is for the sake of their own lives and property, so it is hoped that citizens will cooperate closely with the police branch office in charge to complete this measure. This air raid shelter will naturally be built on public vacant land or by the roadside as a principle, but if there are obstacles such as underground works such as water pipes or gas pipes, it may not be subject to these restrictions in certain circumstances. The Municipal Construction Bureau (formerly the Works Bureau) will begin to investigate the location of underground works. Before digging air raid shelters, citizens can first inquire with the Construction Bureau to know the existence of underground works at the digging site and obtain accurate instructions. Individuals or groups should also plan together with their respective police branch offices in order to make the digging uniform. Each police branch office will be able to assist the people in digging under the guidance of the Construction Bureau. During Air Raid Shelter Digging Week, we hope that the largest number of air raid shelters will be dug, and we hope that every citizen will do their utmost to realize this plan."</p>

Any citizen of this city who wishes to join the club as a member can apply to join the hall from today. The hall also has recruitment chapters and preparations for members. In addition, the hall's music research association is also in the process of organizing, and welcomes those who are proficient in music and have a research interest to join as members.</p>

<p>Since Mayor Zhou, concurrently Director Luo of the Finance Bureau, took office, he has spared no effort in rectifying various consumption special taxes in this city. Recently, he jointly issued a public notice strictly prohibiting civil servants and military police from demanding tax exemption from shops. If there is any refusal to pay, shops are allowed to call the police and hand them over to the police station for punishment.

<p>It is reported that the authorities in charge and relevant parties are now actively planning the issue of population evacuation in this city.

<p>In order to increase work efficiency and reform major police matters, the Municipal Police Bureau has also improved the treatment of police officers. In addition to increasing allowances, it will also distribute free food rice to Chinese employees starting this month, stipulating (A) 2.5 dou per person per month for unmarried persons, (B) 4 dou per person per month for married persons without children, (C) 6 dou per person per month for married persons with children, in order to stabilize the lives of police officers. It is learned that this month's free ration of rice has arrived in port, and yesterday notified various units such as branch offices and teams to extract the amount due based on the form, and distribute it to subordinate members by the unit leaders. As for the issue of salary increase, the bureau has generally planned and decided, and will announce and implement it within days.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Expanding Welfare Society <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In order to seek the welfare of the police officers themselves, the Municipal Police Bureau is actively expanding the police bureau's welfare society. It is learned that the municipal government has increased the society's funds to 130 million yuan (originally 30 million yuan) in preparation for purchasing cheap food rice, and it is heard that the police bureau's public dining hall is also being expanded.</p>

<p>The city authorities are carrying out plans to evacuate the population, but the issue of traffic is a prerequisite for the evacuation of the population. It is heard that the city's inland river shipping company, in addition to maintaining the original Shanghai-Suzhou direct express ships, has also specially opened a Shanghai-Kunshan express shift. Due to the reduction of train services, the number of citizens switching to inland river shipping is quite crowded. Therefore, the company is currently actively adjusting the original route.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Finance Bureau Adds Southern District Special Tax Collection Office <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has added a fourth Southern District Branch Collection Office on the upper floor of the French Post Office Building at No. 9 South Huangpu Road to take over the consumption special tax affairs in the Nanshi area. The bureau's announcement is recorded as follows: "According to the Shanghai Municipal Government Shanghai Municipal Team No. 2 No. 12645 training order: According to the Ministry of Finance's Yang telegram, the retail of goods and the special tax on consumption of banquets and hotels, in addition to the Shanghai city area, was originally levied by the Ministry's Taxation Department, but the scope is wide and the audit is difficult to be comprehensive. From January 1, 34, the above-mentioned special tax, all within the jurisdiction of your municipal government, is entrusted to your municipal government to handle it on its behalf, so as to enrich tax revenue, etc. Therefore, it should be followed. Now, the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau Consumption Special Tax Fourth Southern District Branch Collection Office (upper floor of the French Post Office Building, No. 9 South Huangpu Road) is first established to take over the consumption special tax in the Nanshi area, and the system of dispatching personnel to collect taxes is abolished. All businesses in the Nanshi area shall quickly report and pay the retail of goods and the special tax on consumption of banquets and hotels that have been collected on behalf of the year 34 since January 1 until the end of February. From now on, the monthly tax shall be paid before the 25th of each month. If it is found that tax evasion or overdue payment occurs, it will be punished accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e25">Application Method for Goods Rationing <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>When various agencies in this city apply to the goods rationing office for rationing, it is often covered by the department or handling personnel of the general affairs department of each agency with a department stamp or private seal, and even apply directly to the department in charge of the office, which is not consistent. It is heard that in order to ensure verification, the office has stipulated that in the future, applications for rationing from various agencies shall be sealed and applied for by the head of the competent agency before they can be verified and distributed. Applications sealed and applied for by the department or handling personnel shall not take effect.</p>
<p>Brief Comment</p>
<h3 id="e26">Importance of Self-Discipline <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a rumor in the city that there is large-scale gambling in a certain place, and the gambling house has been revived. A certain dance hall can be specially operated until 3:00 AM because it has secretly used a special name, so there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have also received many letters from readers who believe that this phenomenon should not occur during the municipal innovation. We believe that if it is indeed the case, the municipal standing committee will definitely not let it go, and the citizens can rest assured.</p>
<p>The name is the name, the fact is the fact, and the fact cannot be confused by secretly using the name. Officials cannot use the name of hanging up a sheep's head to sell dog meat. In this decisive period and in this period of municipal renewal, social affairs must move in the direction of adapting to the wartime system and benefiting the public welfare. If it violates the wartime system and violates the public welfare, even if there are means of stealing the sky and changing the day, and even if there are means of deceiving and taking advantage of, it will inevitably be opposed by the social theory.</p>
<p>We hope that the Chinese and Japanese officials and people living in Shanghai will jointly recognize the trend of the times and value the way of self-discipline.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Director Xu of the Economic Bureau Discusses Economic Policies: The Fifth Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Propaganda Department held its fifth regular press conference at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 24th) in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building. Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau was invited to attend, report on the recent adjustments within the bureau, and answer questions from reporters regarding economic policy matters. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Selling Above the Price Limit: Legal Action Will Be Taken</p>
<p>(1) (Question) Now that the new price limits for major commodities at retail outlets have been approved, all companies and businesses should abide by these new price limits. If any business continues to feign compliance while acting otherwise, how does the Bureau intend to handle this?</p>
<p>Director Xu replied: Now that the new price limits for major commodities at retail outlets have been approved, all companies and businesses should strictly comply. If any dare to feign compliance while acting otherwise, this Bureau will not only dispatch personnel for secret investigations at any time but also allow citizens to report such violations. Once verified, this Bureau will immediately notify the Police Bureau to take legal action.</p>
<p>Strengthening Trade Association Organizations</p>
<p>(2) (Question) There are many trade associations for major commodities in the city with overlapping business categories, and many also have unsound internal organizations. What steps are currently being considered to strengthen the organization of various trade associations?</p>
<p>(Answer) It has been found that a total of 244 association units have been established in this city, of which 72 units are related to major commodities, 32 units to secondary commodities, and 140 units to ordinary commodities. Among them, some have similar natures and business categories, leading to frequent disputes, while others suffer from loose association affairs due to unsound organizations. It is indeed necessary to thoroughly reorganize them. To strengthen the organization of associations, this Bureau will closely analyze all associations, compile a reorganization program, and implement it in two steps:</p>
<p>(1) Reorganization: Reorganization work will be carried out for those ordered by decree and those with practical needs. Those with overlapping business categories will be merged, those with unsound organizations will be reorganized, and those with no need to exist will be eliminated to achieve a sound and manageable structure. (2) Management: Management methods will start with a comprehensive investigation, examining personnel selection, association affairs, work progress, economic conditions, and so on, one by one. A performance evaluation method will also be established to serve as a basis for review and to achieve strengthening.</p>
<p>Careful Plans to Promote Production</p>
<p>(3) (Question) Regarding the management of materials in this city and the promotion of production, what are the future strategies for advancement?</p>
<p>(Answer) For the management of materials, the priority is to thoroughly implement the registration of various major commodities. In the past, this Bureau only handled four types: candles, matches, and coal. Now, following the issuance of the "Implementation Measures for Unified Evaluation of Important Commodities" by the Ministry of Industry, covering a total of sixteen types, our department is preparing to continue organizing and implementing registration at the beginning of next month. As for how to promote production, the relevant departments have been instructed to make careful plans, and the associations of relevant production factories have been instructed to submit plans for increasing production in their respective industries for review, in order to supervise and gradually implement them.</p>
<p>Investigating and Reorganizing Industrial and Commercial Registration</p>
<p>(4) (Question) Although the handling of industrial and commercial registration has been relatively active in the past, there are still businesses operating as usual without applying for registration. At the same time, some have already applied for registration but have not yet received their business licenses. How do you plan to reorganize this in the future?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) It has been found that merchants in this city have not fully complied with the procedures of obtaining certificates from this Bureau for doing business and setting up shops. As a result, some established or newly established industrial and commercial firms have not applied to this Bureau for registration and licensing before starting operations. In order to reorganize the registration, the Ministry of Industry previously requested the Municipal Government to instruct this Bureau to notify all factories in the city to complete registration by the end of March of this year. Those who fail to do so within the time limit will be punished according to regulations, and their existing licenses may be revoked. This Bureau has already distributed notices and announcements in the news to comply with this. (2) For industrial and commercial registrations that have been applied for, personnel have been dispatched to investigate the reported capital. Some industrial and commercial firms have been found to be consistent with their reports and should be issued licenses in order. Many others are inconsistent with their reports and will be instructed to re-apply for registration with accurate information.</p>
<p>Continuing to Inspect Warehouse Goods</p>
<p>(5) (Question) What was the situation of the past inspections of public and private warehouses throughout the city? It has not yet been announced. Unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate market prices have not been severely punished. Is this inspection work still ongoing? If unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate are found, how will they be sanctioned?</p>
<p>(Answer) This Bureau's inspection of public and private warehouses and storage facilities has been conducted by personnel dispatched by former Director Xu, together with the Economic Security Department, dividing the area into groups for investigation. About 70-80% of the work has been completed. After I took office, I will continue to dispatch personnel to carry out the inspections. If any illegal acts of hoarding and speculation are found, they will be severely punished in accordance with the "Temporary Regulations for Combating Wartime Economic Offenses" and the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Investigating Warehouse Storage of Goods" drafted by this Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Wealth and Fame is Being Performed Today in Two Shows <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Students from fourteen universities in this city are jointly performing "Wealth and Fame" at the Guanxin Grand Theater to raise scholarship funds. Yesterday's two shows, matinee and evening, were fully booked. The performance results were satisfactory. Today is Sunday, the last two shows, one at 10 AM and the other at 7 PM. We especially invite the supporting patrons to arrive on time. Those who have pre-purchased honorary tickets and regular tickets can exchange them temporarily. Those who had tickets for 2 PM on the 18th can exchange them for tickets for 10 AM today. And those who had tickets for 7 PM on the 18th can exchange them for tickets for 7 PM today. We deeply apologize for the repeated changes in the ticket exchange procedure due to other reasons! We hope that the supporting patrons will understand.</p>
<p>Saving Funeral Expenses to Contribute to Scholarships</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Man Yu Yun writes: "Respectfully announcing that the 25th of February marks the second anniversary of the passing of my late son, Shou Tong. Originally, I intended to follow custom and hire monks to perform rituals. However, lamenting the difficult times and deeply saddened by the large number of young people who cannot afford to go to school, I am donating the 60,000 yuan originally set aside for the rituals along with this letter. Half will be used for the Xinwen Bao scholarship fund, and half will be used for your newspaper's scholarship fund, to fulfill his lifelong ambition to study hard.

<p>The two basketball giants, Zhongbei and Hualian, met last night in the public basketball 甲甲 first-round finals. As a result of the intense battle, Zhongbei defeated Hualian by a margin of four points, 32-28. In the first half, Zhongbei led 19-12.</p>
<p>Because tickets were sold in advance last night, the number of tickets was strictly limited, so the order in the stadium was well maintained, which took a lot of effort. Both sides gave quite exciting performances. Zhongbei had good offense and defense and maintained the upper hand throughout. Li Zhengzhong, Chen Xuechong, and Zhuo Guorong were particularly outstanding. Hualian had poor luck with their ball handling and missed many shots. The usually accurate shooters were all out of form last night, due to nervousness. Hualian emphasized defense over offense last night, and their breakthroughs under the basket did not seem to work.</p>
<p>In addition to Li, Chen, and Zhuo, Zhongbei's lineup also included Shen Yugong and Zhao Yalin. When Zhuo Guorong was fouled out, he was replaced by Bao Songyuan. Hualian's lineup included Wu Chengzhang, Que Li, Xu Jusheng, and the guards Qu Xilin, Fan Qinggong, and Kong Guangyi. Zhang Liangxiong and Que Li were fouled out one after another, and Jin Changchun replaced them.</p>
<p>Hualian began to chase. After Zhuo was fouled out in the second half, Hualian scored three consecutive times, creating a tense situation of 28-25. Unfortunately, they could not turn the tide from there, and Zhongbei scored again directly. There were many fouls on both sides last night, but the sportsmanship was excellent.</p>
<p>Tonight's schedule: (1) Xuebai vs. Overseas Chinese (female) at 5:15 PM. (2) Yikang vs. Three Provinces (female) at 6 PM. (This) V team vs. Fat team (甲乙) at 6:45 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e36">"The British Empire's" Bankruptcy White Paper Pleads for Aid from Various Nations; Restoring Its Former Status Has Become a Delirious Dream <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>On November 28th of last year, the British government released the so-called "Bankruptcy White Paper," automatically declaring that it had exhausted "more than half of what had been accumulated since the era of our grandfathers" during the five years of war. It is a well-known fact that Britain has been using the legacies from the Victorian era. But why did the British government specifically publicize these facts? Just as a person burdened with debt hopes that creditors who fear his bankruptcy will temporarily spare him from it, Britain deliberately exposed its own predicament to the United States, the various dominions of the British Empire, and the countries of the old Sterling area, hoping to restore its former international status with the aid of these countries. In other words, Britain cannot and does not expect to regenerate itself through legitimate means, but only seeks to exploit other countries. However, this can be said to be a dangerous tightrope walk. There is doubt as to whether the lamentations of a fading Britain can move countries that have changed their minds. In short, the "Bankruptcy White Paper" can be said to have proven that the depth of the crisis facing the British Empire is more profound than anticipated. This article provides an overview of the past, present, and future rise and fall of the British Empire, as well as the domestic and foreign contradictions encountered by Britain, from the above perspective.</p>
<p>A Double-Edged Sword</p>
<p>"The various conditions that have formed the foundation of Britain's existence for the past hundred years, which Britain confidently believed it would possess eternally, are in reality, merely things prone to change. Today, this is becoming increasingly clear as time passes."</p>
<p>This is what André Siegfried said on the first page of the introduction to "The Crisis of Britain." These words, written in 1931 when Britain faced an unprecedented crisis, no longer require any explanation today. Because the Second World War has brought the political and economic foundations of Britain's international standing to the brink of danger – this is an undeniable and obvious fact.</p>
<p>Since the last Great War, how has Britain adapted what Siegfried called "things prone to change" to the rapidly changing realities of the world situation? How has it prolonged them as much as possible? These are two questions that are constantly being discussed. As the birthplace of capitalism and the world's factory, Britain entered modern history by adhering rigidly to the traditions of capitalism, while also striving, based on thorough realism, to align its steps with the new direction of progress in the world. Therefore, the more those who believed in possessing things eternally understood things were "prone to change," the more earnestly they strived. The occurrence of the present war can be said to be partly due to Britain's anxiety.</p>
<p>However, it is ultimately impossible to put new wine in old wineskins. The various policies adopted by Britain are, in themselves, sensible and realistic. But the "grand synthesis" of these policies is nothing more than further deepening the worries of the aging empire. How skillfully did Britain utilize the strength of the United States and the Soviet Union since the outbreak of war with Germany? However, how is Britain suffering today from the expansion of American and Soviet power? Observing this, the truth of the matter becomes clear.</p>
<p>The above matters, on the one hand, made Britain's domestic and foreign policies quite ingenious, but on the other hand, they created major loopholes. For example, former British Prime Minister Chamberlain, who quietly passed away as the embodiment of the so-called appeasement policy, must have understood very well that if Britain were to be drawn into a war like the previous Great War, the already eroded foundation of the British Empire would inevitably crack. Precisely for this reason, he was willing to bow to Hitler in Munich. However, in order to maintain the declining British Empire and suppress the rising Axis powers, a year later, this Prime Minister Chamberlain had no choice but to declare war on Germany. In Britain's hands, there wasn't even a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>A Lavish Past</p>
<p>Due to the rapid progress of history today, people easily forget the past. Britain's belief that the foundations that made the nation prosperous in the nineteenth century could last for eternity feels like a delirious dream today. However, in order to know the extent to which Britain's international status has declined, it is still necessary to take a glimpse at the Victorian era.</p>
<p>British philosopher and economist Stanley Jevons wrote the following passage in 1866:</p>
<p>"Free trade, built on our coal resources, has made several parts of the earth's surface become possessions of England: — The plains of North America and Russia are our fields; Chicago and Odessa are our granaries; Canada and the Baltic coast are our forests; Australian pastures are grazing sheep for England; South America has England's herds of cattle; Peru brings silver; California and Australian gold flow into London; the Chinese cultivate tea for us; the Dutch East Indies plantations send coffee, sugar, and medicine; Spain and France are England's vineyards; the Mediterranean coast is England's orchard. Our cotton fields were formerly in the southern United States, but today they are everywhere in the world's major cotton-producing regions."</p>
<p>This is the so-called Pax Britannica. It is now widely known that this "peace under British rule" was built on the sacrifices of many other countries. "Anyone who looks at a map of the British Empire should hang their head in shame!" This is what Stafford Cripps said when he was a socialist in the past. The so-called "free" trade was sending missionaries first, and then sending warships and armies to open up commodity sales routes and forcibly engaging in trade. China drowned in opium, India was perpetually trapped in hunger, and African natives were massacred like locusts: — this is the truth of "free" trade! Even the European countries that considered themselves "civilized" were seen as inferior by the British. "Anyone coming off the ship is a black slave!" This arrogant remark by a certain Englishman fully demonstrates the sense of superiority of the British at that time.</p>
<p>The Decay of the Throne</p>
<p>When the Corn Laws were repealed in 1846, Lord Robert Peel said, "Does England need to fear competition?" But since the twentieth century, Britain has no longer been a country that does not fear competition. In the international trade that Britain had created, countries emerged one after another that competed with and surpassed Britain. In short, goods appeared that were cheaper and better than British goods. Britain's "free" trade, which was so important, ended up endangering its own survival.</p>
<p>It was not only competition with other countries that led to the decline of the British Empire. The domestic political, economic, social system, and colonial rule policies that Britain boasted to the world also gradually decayed from within as time passed. Thus, the collapsing effects from both within and without became closely related to each other.</p>
<p>The aforementioned factors in the decline of the British Empire manifested their effects significantly with the outbreak of the First World War. Britain's intentions in the previous Great War were to suppress the rise of Germany, maintain the balance of power in Europe, protect the British Empire's trade routes, and seize Germany's colonies. These goals were temporarily achieved later, but during and after the war, Britain's domestic system and the cohesion of the British Empire exposed their fragility. In the world market, the United States replaced Germany and became Britain's powerful rival, while other countries also strengthened their positions as competitors against Britain. Furthermore, the Versailles system created by Britain and the United States, among others, actually promoted the rise of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.</p>
<p>The suffering of Britain after the previous Great War was most concentratedly expressed in the financial crisis of 1931. This financial crisis, which attacked Britain as part of the world panic, revealed the fact that Britain had to admit defeat to the United States in international trade and finance. Britain's social policies of "purchasing social stability" by supporting the unemployed with the burdens of capitalists and taxpayers revealed their limits.</p>
<p>In the face of this financial crisis, the policies adopted by Britain were, firstly, to effectively devalue the value of the pound and adopt British Empire trade protection policies in order to boost exports, and secondly, to reduce unemployment benefits domestically in order to restore fiscal balance. These two measures were epoch-making for Britain, but they still inevitably led to a political crisis in Britain. At that time, MacDonald, the Prime Minister of the second Labour Cabinet, in order to suppress the Labour Party's opposition to cutting unemployment benefits, announced his withdrawal from the Labour Party and formed a national unity cabinet. Although the political crisis was overcome as a result, the British political world has since been divided into a national unity faction centered on the Conservative Party and an opposition faction dominated by the Labour Party. The relationship between these two factions, unlike the past Conservative Party (Tory) and Liberal Party (Whig), which made it easy for political parties to privately transfer power, was based on the relationship between the old conservative forces and the newly emerging political forces—the working class. It is very clear that the so-called constitutional norms could not function smoothly under such circumstances. Since then, Britain has always been in a "state of emergency" politically.</p>
<p>The Annual Account is Insufficient</p>
<p>Today, Britain is cooperating with the United States and the Soviet Union to attack Germany in Europe, while in East Asia, it is jointly launching a counter-offensive against Japan with the United States and Chongqing.</p>
<p>Looking back at the path that Britain has taken since the beginning of this war, it can be said that it has almost been defeated on the battlefield, and it has only succeeded in reversing the decline by using scheming. After the disastrous defeat at Dunkirk, the bombing of the British Isles by German aircraft made people feel that they could not recover. Fortunately, the development of the German-Soviet War allowed Britain to breathe a sigh of relief. After that, Britain sought American aid and took advantage of the strength of the United States and the Soviet Union, and as a result, it was able to push the German army back to the border. During this period, it also directly faced domestic crises several times. Especially when it suffered a major defeat in the Greater East Asia War, the Churchill Cabinet received severe criticism from public opinion. However, because the political truce agreement between the parties established at the same time as the outbreak of the war is still in effect, the domestic system has not undergone major changes. From the continuous bombing of London as early as 1940 to 1941, to the power of the V1 and V2 rockets, which plunged the British people into the abyss of terror, they have not completely lost their will to fight.</p>
<p>However, has Britain at least consolidated the foundations for its self-existence and self-reliance through the war thus far? In fact, it is not! As mentioned above, the worries of the British Empire, due to the risks of war, have been superficially somewhat mended, but in reality, they have instead rapidly deepened.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: "The daily account is insufficient, but the annual account is abundant." Britain since the Battle of Dunkirk is the opposite: the daily account is abundant, but the annual account is insufficient. (Translated from the Allied World Weekly, Volume 25, Issue 51)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Map of the Iwo Jima War Zone <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since mid-January of this year, the enemy Americans have successively landed in Mindoro, Lingayen, and Manila in the Philippines, and are currently engaged in fierce warfare in northern Luzon. The enemy Americans have suffered extremely great damage on the Luzon Island front and may be annihilated by the Japanese army and navy. Therefore, the enemy army is under a stagnant war situation and is becoming even more anxious, so on the 16th of this month, it began a landing operation on Iwo Jima near the Japanese mainland. For several days, its progress has been only two or three hundred yards in area. The enemy is suffering from hard battles and losses, and its morale is greatly depressed. The Japanese army is calmly responding to the battle, using air force and ground forces to jointly counterattack, and the sea is exerting the power of submarines, so the losses suffered by the enemy are even greater than those in the past battles of Gilbert and Tarawa. According to enemy propaganda, they plan to seek a second base, such as invading Ryukyu, Taiwan, or the Chinese coast. But considering the heavy blows suffered by the enemy during this landing on Iwo Jima, this attempt will eventually become a dream.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Germany's New Weapon Atomic Bomb Explosive Power Hundreds of Times Greater than Explosives <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>If the experiment of chain-destroying uranium nuclei is successful, then it can release an enormous amount of binding energy, which we have not yet experienced, its power is millions of times greater than that of the explosives used today. It is said that the German army in Western Europe used atomic bombs with terrifying destructive power in this major offensive. Hearing this news cannot help but remind one of the "Neumann explosives" that explosives experts of major powers are most concerned about today. Neumann explosives, mainly in Germany and the Soviet Union, have begun to be used in military artillery. Its breaking power is extremely fierce and can penetrate heavy armor plates that traditional artillery cannot break through. This is a special method of concentrating the explosive power of gunpowder in one direction.</p>
<p>If this great pressure of Neumann explosives can be concentrated at one point, then the artificial destruction of uranium nuclei that various countries are vying to study becomes possible. Japanese scientists such as Dr. Hideki Yukawa, who won the Order of Culture last year, and his teacher Dr. Yoshio Nishina, are also burying themselves in research on the problem of atomic nuclei destruction.</p>
<p>Here is a brief explanation of the principle of destroying atomic nuclei. Elements such as hydrogen and oxygen are made of things called atoms, and atoms are formed by the nucleus and the electrons around it. The nucleus is composed of things called neutrons and things called protons. In other words, the substance that is extracted in pure form from the constituent elements of substances with the same chemical properties is called an atom. For example, the uranium nucleus with an atomic mass of 235 is synthesized from 92 protons and 143 neutrons, and 92 electrons surround its nucleus.</p>
<p>This kind of atomic nucleus was once considered unchanging, but the study of radioactivity has shown that atomic nuclei have the property of change, thus giving rise to the idea: "Can't these naturally mutated things be artificially destroyed?" This is the so-called "artificial destruction of atomic nuclei." Furthermore, because neutrons fly out from this destruction phenomenon, and these neutrons are used as atomic nuclei, a second destruction can occur. Therefore, it is believed that the so-called chain destruction is possible. However, this requires a huge device, so the research goals of atomic physicists in various countries are focused on discovering what kind of artificial radioactive substance can simply extract neutrons. In addition, not only is it limited to uranium, but thorium, an isotope element, can also be used, so the exploration of other heavy elements has also become a major issue in the field of atomic physics. Is the German V3 weapon a weapon for destroying atomic nuclei? Or is it a weapon that uses gunpowder with extremely strong destructive power that is beyond our common sense? At present, it is impossible to know for sure. (Translated from Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Night Walk <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lin</p>
<p>At night, there are hardly any pedestrians on the streets. The light of the street lamps appears very bleak. Occasionally, a few rickshaws are parked on the side of the road, the drivers shrinking their bodies into balls, trying to find their last customer. There are also fruit stalls at the intersections; and vendors selling tofu and vermicelli. As soon as you turn a corner and look back, you can no longer see the flicker of the lamp, only the howling of the cold wind mixed with the persistent cries of the olive sellers.</p>
<p>The ground is very damp, and from time to time your feet will step into puddles – you only realize it when you hear the splashing sound of water under your feet. A thick fog spreads through the space. "It's going to be a rainy day tomorrow."</p>
<p>Walking at night is not a pleasant thing. Dragging a tired body, returning home alone at night, I am already used to this kind of life.</p>
<p>Walking slowly, letting the cold wind blow into my clothes. I slowly walk towards the dark depths.</p>
<p>Of course, I would rather lock myself in a narrow den; with a lonely lamp as a companion, I can read a few books, write some sporadic things, or reply to some letters from friends that I have received long ago. I would never think of those noisy, decadent places of pleasure, cafes, nightclubs, but I would think of a quiet life.</p>
<p>Walking slowly, sighing, silently. Looking at the sky, pitch black, unlikely to clear up. There isn't half a star in the dim sky.</p>
<p>I don't like stars, like some elves, they emit a seductive, dim light. It would be better if the blue and transparent sky was full of stars, I hate that the sky is only adorned with a few stars. Without stars, I won't be aroused by any fantasies. I don't want anything except that quiet life, that is not a suspended but a realistic thought. Away from home, that lonely and quiet life seems to give me some satisfaction. Finally, I don't even think about a quiet life, I don't think about anything.</p>
<p>"Why can't I enjoy this moment of quiet life?"</p>
<p>In this way, you will involuntarily be drawn to other thoughts: "Why?" You may even look back at the distant past or imagine the too-distant future! When you pull your thoughts back and think that you are groping alone in the darkness, you will feel the cold invading you. The strong wind not only penetrates your clothes, but also penetrates your heart.</p>
<p>The coldness is still the coldness, it will not increase or decrease for you, but why should I resent, grieve, and therefore feel the threat of coldness?</p>
<p>"Have a smoke." I thought. I am used to smoking one or two cigarettes on the way home at night, for no reason whatsoever. I feel that smoking is only appropriate in this situation. You will feel the intimacy of the cigarette, and at the same time it will not interfere with your work or harm your rest.</p>
<p>I took out a cigarette and lit it with great difficulty. I walked and smoked. Cigarettes don't give me any inspiration. I have never thought of extracting inspiration from the scent of cigarettes. I held the cigarette in my mouth, hiding the lit fire inside. When I smoked, I saw a glimmer of light. It cannot guide me, I still have to grope. Of course, I would never be ridiculous enough to use it to calculate time or distance. I know all this well, a forty-five-minute walk, from the wide, flat pavement to the shabby alley that is muddy all year round. Smoking, I still perceive that the moisture contained in the space tightly surrounds me. I cannot breathe freely. And I have to endure the cold even more; my heart is fiery, and I still feel that the heat inside me is dissipating towards the cold surroundings. "Even if I wear thicker clothes, it won't help."</p>
<p>"If I were a sick person, a person with a weak body, how could I live this kind of life."</p>
<p>"Don't think about it that way, I am a healthy person, and I am not a lonely person."</p>
<p>Finally, I didn't think about anything again.</p>
<p>I smoked.</p>
<p>I walked in silence.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Warmth <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Friends! In a desolate life, to be able to obtain a sliver of "warmth" to cling to, how delighted would you be! And how much would it invigorate your life force! If you are a painter, then you will certainly be inspired to wield your brush with zeal; if you can sing, then surely your song will contain sweet juice. If you can write poetry and compose prose, then within them will be secretly hidden the secrets of your heart...</p>
<p>This is inevitable! Friends, isn't it? You believe it too.</p>
<p>Suppose you say that the people of the world are too selfish, too ugly, too base! And that it is practically impossible to find an object to entrust your "warmth" to. I can admit that you are right, but at the same time, I can deny that you are wrong. Because, in the past, I also used to think the same way as you, and I was firmly convinced that I was right! But, in recent times... I have found that my "confidence" is gradually wavering; at least from today onwards, I believe that there is definitely no absolute lack of "warmth" in all of humanity! The problem is – encounter!</p>
<p>You are smiling! You feel that what I said makes some sense, doesn't it? Then, light up a cigarette – no! A cigar would be better. And listen quietly.</p>
<p>For example, at this moment, perhaps you are leaning back in a soft sofa, slightly closing your eyes, leisurely blowing smoke rings, or perhaps you are drinking C.P.C. coffee, chewing peanuts or chocolate. But in your small room, there is only you, so quiet that even your own slight breathing can be clearly heard. Friends – have you ever thought, or even hoped, that there would be someone who could talk to you, by your side – gender is not an issue. Quietly listening to you say those "things you want to say" and slowly telling you those "things you like to hear," or perhaps you both love "art!" Then it would be even better to turn the topic to "art."</p>
<p>But, in fact, surrounding you are completely inexplicable and unsuitable people. You cannot find an ideal person worthy of entrusting your "warmth" to, so you are distressed, empty, silent...</p>
<p>In such a situation, I would sympathize with you. But; if you therefore assert that there is practically no decent person in humanity, then I would have to say that you are wrong.</p>
<p>I tell you, you don't have to confine yourself to a predetermined "small circle!" Outside the "small circle," there is also a "big" circle!</p>
<p>In the past, I really made the same mistake as you, but recently I have overturned that distorted theory myself.</p>
<p>Recently, my friends have all said that I have changed! As if I have completely transformed. Yes! Perhaps so – because I have overturned the theory I established before.</p>
<p>I believe! There is "warmth" in the world! – Hidden in every corner of the world, lonely friends! Search, excavate! It will make your desolate life become active and lively.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Story of Lamps <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>Small Words Before the Lamp</p>
<p>Striking a match, the pale yellow lamplight cuts through the desolate twilight, the twilight that is like sea mist, like the rising green smoke from the incense burner, and lets a thin layer of pale yellow fine net cover the quiet room.</p>
<p>Facing the lonely lamp, watching the slightly trembling light, I feel lonely.</p>
<p>Yes, it is loneliness gnawing at the painful heart of the solitary.</p>
<p>Listening to the streets gradually becoming silent, some footsteps walk slowly from far to near, and then from near to far. I know that this day is again embarking on its grueling journey, going to a distant and invisible place. – These endless days...</p>
<p>How should I spend this lonely night?</p>
<p>From time to time, I walk to the window, looking at the street lights outside the window, but the street lights are also silent, like some pale silent eyes.</p>
<p>Above them is the empty sky, without a moon, and without stars. – There is one, I know that it is the evening star.</p>
<p>I hope there is a guest visiting at night, a friend, or a traveler returning from afar. But there is none. Not even the sound of footsteps can be heard on the street. So I sit at the desk, propping my chin, before the lamp, in the silence... How should I spend this lonely night?</p>
<p>2 Watchman and Wind and Rain Lamp</p>
<p>I think of Ding Gui, a watchman in a small town, and his wind and rain lamp.</p>
<p>The desolate clapper sound rings in the dark night, and the watchman Gui comes from the deep alley. Every night, carrying the wind and rain lamp, like a diviner in the daytime, he walks from the long street to the deep alley, and from the deep alley to the long street, bringing a little sound to this small town. He asks about people's dreams, and also urges everyone in their more vague dreams, covered in stars and moon, to walk from the dark night to the dawn...</p>
<p>In my childhood, I had heard some stories about watchmen. One watchman finished eating wontons at a wonton stall on the street, and raised his head to pay, but suddenly saw the wonton seller taking his own head off his body and placing it on the carrying pole. Another watchman met a beautiful woman walking at night in a deep alley, and followed her in a daze into a luxurious mansion, but the next day he was found lying in a desolate graveyard...</p>
<p>Because of this, I felt a little mysterious about the watchman Ding Gui. Watchmen were originally considered mysterious; they are dreamers in the daytime, but elves at night.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid?" I asked him, one night, when the clapper sound knocked under my window.</p>
<p>"People who walk at night are not afraid of anything, sir," he replied quietly, "and I also have this."</p>
<p>He raised the wind and rain lamp.</p>
<p>"With it, I am not afraid of anything." He nodded to me and walked on his way.</p>
<p>The desolate clapper sound rang again.</p>
<p>3 Eternal Lamp</p>
<p>An eternal lamp lights up in my memory, the undying fire in the big temple outside my hometown city.</p>
<p>The eternal lamp is offered in front of the golden Buddha statue, and the monks in the temple say to every tourist:</p>
<p>"Since there has been this temple, the eternal lamp has never been extinguished. Countless people constantly send sesame oil to keep it burning forever, always going east."</p>
<p>"What if it goes out?" A child asked, not understanding.</p>
<p>"If it goes out," the monk's face suddenly became serious, "then the world will be in great chaos, and mankind will suffer a great calamity, in a daze, without daylight. We must never let it go out, never let it go out. Look, it has never gone out since ancient times, and it will never go out."</p>
<p>In fact, it has indeed never gone out, and without mentioning the distant past, just from the time I saw it, every time I went to that temple, the eternal lamp was always lit, and the hearts of the people in the small city were all lit by this eternal sacred fire. They felt that as long as the eternal lamp was lit, they would always have good days. Didn't the monks in that temple say, "The Bodhisattva has eyes"?</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for ten years, and I wish to send a piece of nostalgia to the returning wind. And with great sincerity, I bless the sacred fire in the hearts of the people in the small city, the eternal eternal lamp.</p>
<p>4 Lighthouse</p>
<p>My imagination flies to the seaside at night, where a lighthouse stands.</p>
<p>I should thank the first person to build a lighthouse, who silently protected and saved the lives of countless people. In children's books, there was a story about a lighthouse, how an old man and a young daughter fought back the attacks of the sea and the dark night with their weak strength in the waves and the deep night, and brought a ship of passengers back to the world from the hands of death.</p>
<p>When telling this story to the children, it aroused some sympathy, admiration, and excitement.</p>
<p>"What happened later?" The children habitually asked at the end of the story.</p>
<p>"There was nothing later," I said, "The rescued people returned to their hometowns one by one, leaving the father and daughter still in that lighthouse."</p>
<p>"Is there no one to accompany them?" Someone asked kindly, "There are only the father and daughter, how lonely!"</p>
<p>"Who accompanies them?" I replied, "And the people in the lighthouse are always lonely. The only thing that accompanies him is the lamp."</p>
<p>Dear sir, when you are traveling on the sea, watching the endless waves on the deck during the day, listening to music, dancing, and drinking coffee in the multi-story hall at night, and not feeling that the cruise ship you are on is continuing its voyage in the dark night, have you ever thought of the lighthouse silently helping you on the seaside, and the lonely night watchman inside the lighthouse?</p>
<p>5 Moth and Firefly</p>
<p>Beside the oil lamp on summer nights, there is often a beautiful silver-white moth, circling around the trembling lamplight.</p>
<p>The moth may have been resting in some invisible corner before, but seeing the lamplight, it flew from the darkness, circling around the pale yellow lamplight, flying, flying, flying closer.</p>
<p>Finally, with a hiss, the lamplight flickered, the moth struggled a few times with its burnt wings, and finally, had no strength, so it quietly lay in the lamp oil in the bowl, motionless, letting the oil soak through its silver-white wings and body.</p>
<p>Poor martyr! You flew to the lamplight full of enthusiasm and joy, but the lamplight destroyed you.</p>
<p>I also thought of another kind of hero of summer nights, the firefly. When I was young, I often begged adults to find a way to catch them and put them in a gauze bag, singing:</p>
<p>Big barley, small barley,</p>
<p>Fireflies fly down!</p>
<p>I won't hit you, I won't scold you,</p>
<p>I'll play with you and then let you go.</p>
<p>So the old man told me a story about someone using a firefly sac to read. – It was used as a lamp.</p>
<p>The moth longs for the lamplight, so it sacrifices itself in the fire, this is a beautiful story. But the firefly, what a tragic experience! It brings light to people, and even helps poor scholars to read in the summer night, but people trap it in a gauze bag, and it never sees that bit of light itself?</p>
<p>6 Epilogue</p>
<p>The dream has ended, and what accompanies me is still a dim lamp.</p>
<p>Some people say that the lamp is a symbol of light. But, sir, I am an ordinary person, and under this faint lamplight in front of me, I didn't think of these things. I have been sitting here for so long, I just feel that the sacred fire stolen by that Prometheus also ignited the warmth in my heart. Although it is lonely, there is a lamp accompanying me. I think of what the watchman Ding Gui in the small town said:</p>
<p>"With it, I am not afraid of anything."</p>
<p>Let me add some sesame oil, change a wick, and tell you the story of the light again...</p>
<h3 id="e42">Rainy Night <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>It was a rainy night, the torrential rain was pouring down outside the window, the room contained a humid and stuffy atmosphere, making people feel very uncomfortable, as if suffocating. A child of more than ten years old was sitting at the desk, reciting his book loudly; his grandfather - an old man with white hair - was leaning diagonally on the sofa beside the desk, a kind expression of quietly listening to the sound of reading piled on his amiable old face.</p>
<p>"The world has people without mothers, Heaven, how painful!" The sound of reading stopped abruptly here. The old man seemed to be somewhat lost in thought, and sighed a long sigh.</p>
<p>"Grandpa! I have finished my homework, can your story start now?" the child said, moving his chair closer to the old man.</p>
<p>"Story? What story?" the old man was a little absent-minded.</p>
<p>"Grandpa! You tell me stories at this time every day, how could you forget today?" the child added.</p>
<p>"Um... story! Good! Let's take it as a story... Child! Don't forget this story after you hear it, you should keep it in your heart forever, deep in your heart!" the old man answered to himself as if suddenly realizing.</p>
<p>"Why? Grandpa!" the child asked curiously.</p>
<p>"This is because... oh! Listen to me! Don't interrupt."</p>
<p>Ten years ago, it was such a rainy night, a story happened in this house. The old man was still sitting on the sofa, but in front of him was not the child, but the child's father, a middle-aged man who was addicted to romance. The old man said angrily:</p>
<p>"Are you here to be a lobbyist for her? Don't even think about it!" He stood up abruptly: "You have to know that she is suffering from tuberculosis, which is contagious, especially to children. Wouldn't it be too dangerous if we didn't isolate her? Besides, she is just your concubine, is it worth paying so much attention to?"</p>
<p>"Dad! She just wants to see the child one last time, she will die in peace. Please... please..."</p>
<p>"Don't babble anymore, go away!" the old man dragged the middle-aged man away and left on his own.</p>
<p>"Alas! Meeting such a stubborn father is really embarrassing..." the middle-aged man ran out with a mournful face, unaware of the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Late at night, the rain was getting heavier. In the hospital ward, a dying sick woman was lying down. The middle-aged man walked to the edge of the bed and lowered his head, leaning against her haggard face and said:</p>
<p>"Wen! Please forgive me, Dad won't allow it, he hid the child, I can't find him, I told him, but he doesn't listen -" The sick woman opened her weak eyes in annoyance, staring at the middle-aged man for a moment, then her dry lips opened and moved, as if she wanted to speak, but couldn't make a sound - finally, she choked and died, her left eye still not closed!</p>
<p>"Wen! What's wrong with you! Why don't you speak? Why..." the middle-aged man shook the sick woman's body frantically, crying and shouting loudly. Finally, he was half-deceived and dragged out of the ward by the nurses and hospital servants.</p>
<p>From then on, the middle-aged man was sent to a mental hospital, and soon followed his beloved companion.</p>
<p>"Now only that child without parents is left, pitifully living with his old grandfather! It's me - no! It's that old man who is bad, why didn't he let the mother and son see each other for the last time?" the old man said, sadly expressing his personal after the "story."</p>
<p>"Then! Grandpa, is my mother that poor sick woman?" It was the child's question.</p>
<p>"…………" The old man couldn't answer anymore, two tearful beads suddenly hung on his old and thin face, was it sorrow? Or repentance?</p>
<h3 id="e43">To Friends Who Are About to Graduate <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>People in the world often like to regret. Li Si, the prime minister of the great Qin Dynasty, still missed a rabbit he hunted when he was dying in the market of Xianyang. George Bernard Shaw thought that people must first jump to the end of life and then turn back to savor it, but it is actually just a joke. And you, when you are about to wear a square hat, you are also thinking of "going back to savor the joy of freshman year in college", which is certainly good, but what is the use of regret? What's more, even if you were to be a Freshman again now, what would you do? I want to ask again, what's the use of regret?</p>
<p>It is true that the old saying "graduation means unemployment" "still has its power", and "what you learn is not what you use" is not only your friend C.H.W.T.L… Many Sorens are suffering and worrying about this shadow. Tens of thousands of college graduates are also regretting why they took those courses that are completely unrelated to their current profession. And tens of thousands of Freshmen Sophomores Joniers are about to embark on this muddy road. It's not just you who feel gloomy.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should take this as everyone's business.</p>
<p>However, everyone sometimes does not think of these things, which means that there are still some beautiful dreams in front of people. For these dreams, they do not hesitate to exchange a lot of money, time, and energy for a diploma; a hat, and a title. Although they know that it is a dream, they still want to do it, which means that when there is no other way, dreaming is also good.</p>
<p>Lu Xun said in "What Happens After Nora Leaves" that if there is no way, it is better to let people continue to dream, don't wake them up, because the pain of returning from dreams to reality is greater. And you, you woke up those who were immersed in dreams, but after waking up, there is no way to go, and everyone you bump into is suffering the same fate, so those who did not have pain begin to discover pain, and those who already have pain are even more painful.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that you should be willing to dream, or that you should advise people not to face the bloody reality. Facing reality is still necessary and most important, and now, who can know what you will encounter when you graduate, or what kind of world it will be. We don't even know if we will get household registration tomorrow, why think so far?</p>
<p>This does not mean that "the boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge", or that you should muddle through one day at a time, but that it is really useless to think too much. As mentioned earlier, this is not your business alone, it is everyone's business, it is a very big problem. We can't solve it with our little strength. Just like you, you raised such a problem, which can be regarded as a call to people, but how much of our society can this change?</p>
<p>Our society is such a society. Before it is thoroughly reformed, even if one-tenth of college graduates use their "knowledge", even - let's have another even - every graduate finds his job, you say, how much of a role can it play in such a society?</p>
<p>To say it again, this is originally everyone's business.</p>
<p>Therefore, now, worry and pain are superfluous, it is better to be at ease in your own position!</p>

<h3 id="e44">Commentary on the Sino-Northern China United University Match <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Due to venue constraints, the third annual basketball league urgently needs to conclude within the month. Therefore, matches have been held daily recently, making it an extremely busy time. Currently, the only remaining Group A match is between Sino-Northern China and United University. The makeup game from their first round was held yesterday at 6 PM in the old Western Youth basketball court. Given the difficulty in maintaining order, the authorities, in order to limit the audience, temporarily increased ticket prices to 500 yuan upstairs and 2,000 yuan downstairs, and also limited the number of tickets available. However, the high prices did not deter the fans, and all tickets were sold out. It is estimated that over a thousand people were left disappointed. This shows the immense appeal of the match. Since the number of tickets was strictly limited, the venue was not overcrowded, with every seat filled and no empty spaces, creating a truly standard atmosphere. We will first list the current standings for the group, and then describe yesterday's game and provide commentary:</p>
<p>Looking at the standings above, Sino-Northern China's victory over United University yesterday allowed them to take sole possession of first place. They will face each other again in the second round, giving United University another chance. Sino-Northern China is the only Northern-style team in Shanghai, while United University has enjoyed a strong reputation in the basketball world for years. Yesterday's match also yielded a most satisfying result. Therefore, we will detail the process of this exciting North-South battle below.</p>
<p>Referee Liu Hesheng and Yang Liecheng invited both team captains, Wang Zhongtao and Kong Guangyi, to shake hands as a gesture of respect. After determining positions, the jump ball was held at center court. The starting lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Botte (United University Forward) Qu Xilin (United University Guard)</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong (Sino-Northern China Guard) Shen Gong (Sino-Northern China)</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang (United University Forward)</p>
<p>Chen Xuechong (Sino-Northern China Forward)</p>
<p>Xu Jusheng (United University Forward) Zhang Kangxiong (United University Guard)</p>
<p>Zhuo Guorong (Sino-Northern China Guard) Zhao Yalin (Sino-Northern China Forward)</p>
<p>Showcasing Skill, Achieving Ideal Results</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Both sides adopted a man-to-man defense, resulting in the above matchups. Zhenzhong tried first but missed. Xilin's long shot also missed. Xuechong tricked his way into the center and scored with a reverse shot. Chengzhang committed a foul, Xuechong missed both free throws, and Sino-Northern China opened the scoring. They attacked again, Xuechong used the same tactic, Chengzhang fouled again, and both free throws missed. Lingzhong darted in but was stopped by Liangxiong, who committed a holding foul. Zhenzhong made one free throw, making it 3-0. At this point, both sides became extremely chaotic, and Sino-Northern China called a timeout. United University also took the opportunity to substitute Wu Chengzhang with Fan Qinggong, who guarded Zhao Yalin, while Liangxiong guarded Xuechong – this was United University's planned strategy. Botte fouled again, Zhenzhong scored another free throw, making it 4-0. Liangxiong made two wild shots, and United University urgently called a timeout to calm down. Sure enough, Jusheng scored two free throws after Zhuo committed a foul, and then made a long shot, tying the score at 4-4. This was the only time the score was tied in yesterday's game. Afterwards, Sino-Northern China suddenly became more active. A-Che made a left-handed shot, boosting their morale, and they quickly added five points. United University then substituted Kong Guangyi for Qinggong, hoping to use his aggressiveness to compete with Yalin. However, they still couldn't stop Sino-Northern China's score from rising rapidly, from 12-5 to 17-9. By the end of the first half, Zhuo committed a foul, and Botte scored on the free throw, making the score 19-12 in favor of Sino-Northern China, a lead of seven points.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>During the break, Wang Zhongtao and Zhang Xiang each imparted their strategic advice, full of confidence. When they resumed play, the situation remained the same. Xuechong pretended to take a shot, but at this time, Jusheng became very active, causing Zhuo to commit numerous fouls. When Sino-Northern China led 25-14, Zhuo was ejected with four fouls and replaced by Bao Songyuan. United University took advantage of the opponent's unsteady formation, with Jusheng and Botte excelling on both sides, quickly closing the gap to 25-21, only two baskets behind. Sino-Northern China had to call another timeout to suppress the momentum. At this time, both sides exerted their full skills, creating a tense atmosphere. The score became 27-22. Yalin was replaced by Li Baozhong, putting them in a difficult battle. With seven minutes left, when United University trailed 29-25, Liangxiong and Xilin missed four easy shots, and Xuechong scored on a reverse shot, solidifying the outcome of the game. It seemed to be fate. In the end, Sino-Northern China won by a score of 32-28, defeating United University by two baskets. Sino-Northern China was successful, and United University, despite the loss, played with honor. Attached are the score sheets for both teams:</p>

<h3 id="e45">Both Teams Showed Success, Both Adopted Man-to-Man Defense <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>We should not judge heroes by success or failure. Looking at the entire game process of both teams yesterday, they both showed development in basketball skills. This alone is a success. The reasons why Sino-Northern China was able to win are: first, experience, and second, skillful management. Therefore, the importance of guidance is no less than that of the soldiers on the front line. Using Zhuo to guard Jusheng was a wise move. Although Bao Songyuan has excellent skills, he is bound to make mistakes against the lively Jusheng. This was evident after Zhuo was fouled out. The greatest contributors to Sino-Northern China's success were Zhenzhong and Xuechong. The former remained the soul of the team, connecting offense and defense, which was very beneficial. Although Xuechong made many erratic shots, his reverse shots in the center forced defenders to foul, which was truly intimidating to the opponent. In addition, the team's tall stature allowed them to gain many rebounds under the basket, which meant more offensive opportunities. More offensive opportunities naturally lead to a greater chance of victory, which is a major reason why Sino-Northern China won.</p>
<p>The biggest reasons for United University's loss yesterday were losing too many points in the first half and Zhang Liangxiong's excessive nervousness. Zhang is also considered a contributing member. He had many shooting opportunities yesterday, but unfortunately, he was too hasty, and the shots always bounced out. If he could have calmed down a bit, his scoring would have improved. Botte was more than capable on offense, but lacked in defense, and committed many unnecessary fouls, perhaps because he was not familiar with Zhenzhong's playing style. Xilin claimed to have been quite successful in guarding Qungong, but he was also marked closely by Qungong, preventing him from attempting long shots. Overall, his contributions were more positive than negative. Qungong was also a major scorer for Sino-Northern China. United University lost yesterday, but their performance was highly ideal and can be considered a success.</p>
<p>Regarding the tactics of both teams, they both adopted a man-to-man defense, closely guarding their assigned player and never letting up, fulfilling their responsibilities. The view was excellent. However, I felt that they rarely utilized screens and switches, which would have made for a more beautiful scene. Sticking to a man too tightly is tiring, and a slight positional error can create a gap. At necessary times and depending on the position, they should have switched defenders. In this first match, Sino-Northern China achieved their goal. Next time they meet, United University will surely make new improvements to seek revenge, while Sino-Northern China will continue their efforts to win the championship without a doubt. The prediction is that it will be even more captivating.</p>

Apart from the Green Team, they can claim dominance. With further effort, they have great potential.

<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>(E) Other Basic Individual Offensive Techniques</p>
<p>In addition to catching, passing, shooting, and dribbling, which are the main basic movements in basketball, there are other very important movements such as starting, stopping, pivoting, blocking, and feinting. In a game, in addition to a courageous and fierce fighting spirit, it is even more important to have the talent to use these basic movements. Players with talent can easily achieve mastery. However, even those who lack talent can still aspire to excellence if they constantly study and diligently practice various basic techniques. Therefore, the following basic movements are essential to pay attention to and master.</p>
<p>(1) Starting – A player who can start (i.e., run) quickly can often attack the opponent unprepared and evade the enemy's tight defense. Passing and shooting also become more agile, and movements feel more alert. It is common to see players miss opportunities due to slow starts, making them easily watched. The correct starting posture involves the feet being staggered, about one foot apart, with the distance between them being the same width as the shoulders. The body should be slightly bent forward, with the head looking forward. Both arms should be bent forward, and the body should be balanced, with the center of gravity slightly on the front or back foot, ready to start at any time. (2) Stopping</p>
<p>Being able to start quickly requires being able to stop quickly, in order to respond quickly and freely amidst a fierce battle, especially when holding the ball. There are two ways to stop. One is to stop while sprinting. When wanting to stop, the body should jump slightly, lifting both feet off the ground together. Then, the front sole of the foot should gently touch the ground, and the knee should be bent to stop, with the body slightly bent forward. If holding the ball, it should be placed in the abdomen for pivoting, passing, or shooting. The other is the normal stopping method, which involves taking a step forward with the front foot when wanting to stop while moving, while bending the rear foot slightly to support the body weight. The ball, when held in the hand, must be placed in the abdomen for protection. If you want to pivot after stopping, you must move the front foot to avoid committing the violation of traveling. These two stopping methods can be practiced in combination with walking, pivoting, and jumping.</p>
<p>(3) Pivoting – Pivoting and dribbling can be said to be the most wonderful movements in basketball. These two movements are not naturally occurring, but were invented through the thinking of many past coaches and clever players. After training these two movements to maturity, basketball offensive techniques suddenly changed, no longer as rigid as before.</p>

<p>Green Team secretary Wang Wangqian has almost no interest in sports, perhaps because he has other new developments and no time for it?</p>
<p>Li Yichen had a slight misunderstanding with the friendly authorities, causing him to miss several matches. It has been learned that he has been transferred and should be able to play soon. (End)</p>
