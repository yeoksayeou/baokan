<p>〔合衆社重慶十八日電〕中外記者百餘人，本日參加重慶規模最大之記者招待會，聆聽共黨表示中止向政府作戰之誠意，第八路軍參謀長葉劍英稱：「余爲軍人，在內戰中，余亦進行作戰，余現旣已來此，即表示我人已不願再打，吾則我人決不來。全世界之目光，均集中於中國內部戰與和平之問題，共黨堅持採取第二種辦法。」渠又稱：內戰最劇烈之處，係在平津·張家口·承德之三角地帶。若此一帶之戰事終止，則其他各地戰事之中止必較爲容易，我人決不能以作戰獲得任何解決。又共黨副主席周恩來宣稱：共產黨正竭力促成政治協商會議之揭幕。該會應於一聯合政府之基礎上，擬定一和平建設計劃，首先着手於救濟及復員措置。周氏謂：共黨方面贊同設立一國民大會，俾以民主之制度賦諾國家，在此種民主制度之下，各黨各派享有均等這權利，軍隊則團家化。如政治協商會議未能完成此項任務，則「我人仍將繼續商談，不達自的不止。」周氏並稱：共黨之提議爲彈性的，渠並提及以前之種種讓步，以作事實上之佐證。周氏謂：一般的問題，應在政治協商會議中一致通過，而細則問題，則應有大多數之通過，始能決定。渠强調謂：會議之決議，大家必須遵守，對於軍隊國家化問題，周氏謂：國民黨人士欲先將共黨軍隊併入國軍，然後再使政府民主化，但共黨則主張民主化應先予實行。</p>
<p>政治協商會議　耶誕左右舉行</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶十八日電〕的在聖誕節左右，中國政治家·敎授·學者·銀行家及企業家共三十八人，即可在重慶舉行舉國期待已久之政治協商會議。以討論中國四萬五千萬人民之和平計劃，不具投票權之會議主席蔣介石上將，可望於本星期末返抵重慶，代表國民黨·共產黨·民主同盟及靑年黨等之男代表三十七位，女代表一位，現均齊集重慶，尚有無黨無派代表一人尚未任命。此一政治協商會議，範圍及職權俱極擴大，木　爲一緊急臨時性之和平聯合陣綫，爲十年來最重要政治代表圓桌會議。開會時是否公開，現尙不得而知，討論主要題目，即爲如何全面停戰，使復員工作得以迅速推進。各方面對該會慶望頗殷，雖認該會或許不能解決國共兩黨間政治軍事繁雜之問題，但信該會至少可決定若干有關國民福利之廣泛而緊急之措施。會議所擬討論之主要問題，有召開憲法起草機關之國民大會，建立各黨聯合政府，統一軍事指揮，各省行政機關之組織，正副行政長官之任侖等。</p>

<p>〔聯合社北平十八日電〕蔣主席今日在機場司令室接見中外新聞記者。怱怱數語後，即偕夫人乘機啓節赴京。據主席宣稱：杜魯門總統重申美國對華政策，表示並無變更，甚爲欣慰。現「杜總統之聲明，顯示其於中國目前局勢，非常明瞭。擴大中國政府基礎一事，本人在三月一日發表之演說中已曾提及，此亦即國民大會目的之一。」國民大會已定於明年五月五日召集。主席預料可在南京或漢口與美國駐華特使馬歇爾將軍會晤。據此間得悉，馬氏於本月二十日可抵上海。記者問蔣主席，是否感覺杜魯門總統之聲明，暗示美國期望主席與共產黨作更充分之妥協。經蔣夫人轉譯後，主席即答稱：「杜總統聲明中所言者，即爲本人三年來之主張，希望國共兩黨能實行和平親善之解決辦法」。主席因時間關係，不及對東九省現狀，美國對華復興貸款，及召開政治協商會議各問題，發表意見。某記者詢以中共代表抵渝後，全國團結之希望，是否增大。主席答稱：昨日僅接到彼等到達之消息，不知若輩態度如何。至於與中共軍談判和平，乃我所願。國共妥協亦繫於中共對杜魯門總統宣言之態度，未知中共能吾接受此項宜言。按美國堅持中國不應有自立之軍隊，如中共第八路軍之類，與國軍分立，主席之言殆指此而發。主席夫婦訪問北平，恰歷一星期。</p>

<p>〔中央社倫敦十八日電〕倫敦一般相信，莫斯科外長會議已以遠東間題列入議程，由於英外務部遠東司長白奈特之隨外相貝文赴蘇，即可爲渠等將討論此一問題之確切徵象。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十八日電〕三强外長會議之進行，至爲秘密，昨日莫斯科電台之英文及俄文廣播，對會議均未有所評述。但悉三位外長於星期日夜從事關於程度問題之初步談話後，業已進入正式談話之階段。英外相貝文及美國務卿具爾納斯昨晨頗早即分別召集顧問及大使談話，並研討本國政府最近之訓令。蘇聯報紙自三強外長會議舉行後，即不時有關於原子炸彈，土地託治。及聯合國機構之論文發表。</p>
<p>又電，莫斯科會議第二次會議，於昨晚結束，開會共二小時又二十分鐘，會後未發公報，各方面均力持緘　。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十八日電〕此間權威人士今日　稱：外長會議已「作良好之起始」。今晨英外相貝文與美國務卿貝爾納斯均從事今日午後第三次會議之凖備工作，貝文並擬於開會前訪蘇外委長莫洛托夫。關於議程及討論之一切詳情，現仍嚴守秘密。史太林委員長在高加索墨海畔之索基休假後已返莫斯科，此事宣佈後，蘇人莫不歡迎。史太林返京乃爲處理繁重之公務，預料海外盛傳之種種謠言，將因此宣佈而告終。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕據倫敦消息靈通人士意見，伊朗局勢之惡化，必將使莫斯科會議之任務趨於複雜，聯合國機構固有賴於蘇英美之意見融洽，然三國今對伊朗國內局勢之態度並不一致，而伊朗政府與亞塞爾拜然自治份子爭執之募後，實有列强在中東安全與戰略需要之整個問題在焉。紛擾區現正擴展中，竟未能防止紛擾波及伊拉克與土耳其之柯迭煦人民，以外交方面言，有建議伊朗政府可直接籲請英美援助者。就蘇方報紙與無錢電論調判斷之，蘇聯政府欲認此問題爲中東一般大勢之一部份，而對列强在中東區駐軍事，作整個之討論。故倫敦消息靈通人士相信外長會議之初步交換意見，乃企圖商妥討論事件之限度。外長會議欲在開始重大討論前，以互相信賴爲基礎，而商定共同政策之可能性。顯未因亞塞爾拜然自治份子在大不列士之勝利而較易實現。官方稱，莫斯科會議爲試探性質，然欲求中束恢復寗靜，外長會議必須有具體之協議，事頗顯然。抑史太林之返莫斯科，表示三國會談，現正漸越初步交換意見之階　矣。</p>

<p>〔聯合社渥太華十七日電〕加拿大總理麥根齊金今日在國會中首次報告一月前美英加三國討論原子能經過稱：組織一世界政府，由各國分別交出其國家主權之一部份，此爲原子彈與原子時代所引起各　問題惟一解決辦法。若視原子能爲危險之新藥，而欲管制其在商品及和平方面之使用，此乃一種錯誤。在技術方面與科學方面管理原子能之生產·製造。及最後分配，誠不可少，惟顯然尚嫌不足。我人若想像人類之和平與團結，可用商品管制計劃達到，其愚誠不可及。故原子時代所引起各種問題之最後解決，衹有於哲學範圍中求之。各國亦承認原子能機械的解決法，統制原子能之機構，充其量不過爲一暫時的權宜辦法而已。聯合國機構雖爲建立世界政府之第一步，但尚不足以解決此問題。各國交出其一部份主權後，必須成立一世界新政府，至少在初時其職權僅限於防止戰爭及維持世界安全等事件。原子彈之發明，已使我人睜開雙目，見到聯合國機構若不能完成有效之國際合作，則世界前途定將遇到極可怕之發展</p>

<h3 id="c46">近衛回憶錄　歷述美日戰爭未爆發前　曾與松岡洋右發生摩擦 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十八日電〕近衛文麿自殺後，其所遣回憶錄，載有太平洋戰爭爆發前，美國曾向日本提出方案，此種方案如獲接受，或可避免日美開戰。日本覆文不幸竟被延擱八日。在此八日之間，前外相松岡洋右曾試探德官方對美日談判究竟抱何熊度，惟日本陸海軍及政界要人均認爲美國所提方案，足以解決中日糾紛，不可久延。松岡始將覆文送交美國當局。松岡剛愎自用，性情暴躁，甚且建議美日兩國締結中立條約，但爲美國務卿赫爾所拒絕。覆文送出後，松岡獲得德方答覆，謂願利用美日談判，阻止美國以物資接濟英國，並慫恿日本向美威脅，如美國繼續接濟英國，日本即將參戰。近衛回憶錄中又云，遠在珍珠港事件發生前七個月，已有人主張日本必須</p>
<p>向美宣戰。松岡曾於六月八日奏呈日皇，謂日本如欲參戰，自須與德義兩國合作。近衛曾就參戰問題，徵詢日本聯合艦隊司令山本意見，問其成敗如何。山本答云，戰事如有一定期限，則日本可作戰半年，不致發生問題，但如戰事延長二年或三年，則不能斷言有勝利把握。近衛聆悉之後，即與松岡於其甫由歐洲歸來時，在機場作一長談，但松岡對美國所提方案，幾乎並不感覺興趣。一九四一年四月二十二日夜，松岡曾以響亮暴躁之口吻，報告其赴歐經過，談及美國方案時，松岡表示十分興奮，並特別指出德國根據</p>
<p>三國協約，充分信任日本。美國所提方案，其中惡意佔百分之七十，善意僅百分之三十。松岡對答覆美國方案一味拖延，但其本人對方案內容，應有何種修改則未提出。最後修改各點，於一九四一年五月三日始由內閣通過，時爲松岡自歐洲歸來之第二日。美國方案中曾提議，日本不得向南太平洋進兵，此足保證美日雙方任何一國艦隊，不能在南太平洋建立足以威脅其他一國之基地。惟松岡對此表示反對，將其删去，另外加入一附屬條款，主張於英德兩國戰爭至德國行將勝利之時，由美日出面調停，以結束歐戰。方案修正完畢後，日內閣急欲將覆文送達美國政府，不意又爲松岡所延擱。松岡</p>
<p>通知野村駐美大使，令其向美國國務卿赫爾作一臨時答覆，建議締結美日中立條約，佯作此種建議係出自對野村個人意見。野村於七月五日將締結中立條約方案送達赫爾，但赫爾對之不加考慮。赫爾在此次談判時態度異常堅決，爲平時所少見，並力稱美日交涉應儘速舉行。松岡曾派遣外務省歡亞司長坂本通知德義兩國駐日太使，謂日本政府確已接到關於調整外交關係之秘密建議。德國大使往訪松岡時，松岡問德外長李賓特洛甫有無意見，並稱報復美國惡意與解決中國事件，無論如何德國總屬有利。松岡其時又向日皇，美國如參戰（歐戰），日本自應加入德義方面，處此時會調整美日關係將屬，</p>
<p>徒勞無功。如日本信任德義，而仍消耗如許時間討論美國問題，則予將提出辭職。日本對美國方案所作修正，其中一條遲至十一月十五日送交赫爾，對保證不進兵南下一條已予刪除。赫爾對此大表懷疑。日本最後復文送出後，即接獲德國照會內稱，美國願與日本妥協，意之所在，旣爲結束對德戰事，日本政府應即表明：（一）美國運送船團供給英國物資，日木認爲係有意造成戰事。（二）美國如停止此種行動，則日本對美國建議當予考慮。德國政府並希望日本在送出最後復文時，能預先通知德國，於是內閣與松岡間之擦磨，乃逐漸增加。即日皇裕仁對松岡亦漸失去信任，並曾徵詢是否可將松岡撤職，惟松岡對美國之倔强態度，迄未因此稍改。近衛回憶錄中稱：「就松岡之言行觀之，予懷疑彼在留德期間，是否曾對德國作重要允許，據松岡所作報告，希特勒及李賓特洛甫均堅持日本應進攻新加坡：圓日本各領袖雖曾希望美日談判」滿結束，但此種希望終成泡影。</p>

<p>其秘書牛塲宣布</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十七日合衆電〕近衛之秘書牛塲洩露，一九四一年十月近衛辭首相職時，曾上奏日皇，請撤退在華日軍，以避免與美國作戰。近衛曾稱，東條反對此議，以其可能影響日軍之士氣也。東條相信倘日本屈服，則美國將更無限制自大，「中國事件」雖或可暫時得獲解決，然中日關係於二三年內，終難免破裂。近衛上呈日皇之奏摺中稱，東條堅持吾人必須積極從速決定發動戰事之時間，曾與東條作四次會談，然終未能勸其接受臣之意見，是以臣刻實無從執行襄助陛下之重任。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　林友蘭</p>
<p>從廣州往香港的火車，搭車擁擠，車票已發現黑市。從重慶搭機往香港，明年二月份的座位，亦已預定一空。中國內地的人們，紛紛趕到這塊南部海岸的繁華之島。記者最近　命來港，遠離祖國，置身異　情調中，觀感良多。茲就見聞所及，試爲本報讀者報告。</p>
<p>香港，經過三年八個月的日寇統治，面目已非昔比，主要的改變是：日人已把英國情調掃除大半。中環海旁，向爲英軍儀仗隊歡迎貴賓顯要蒞臨香港的皇后像方場，其四周的銅像，包括雄據中央的維多利亞女　，已被完全搬走。匯豐銀行門前的一雙銅獅，亦與昔日不列顚君主的豐姿，化作大阪工場的原料。</p>
<h3 id="c49">人工之美　遭蝦夷毀壞殆盡 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>日人已把慘淡經營的香港人工美，破壞殆盡。日人在香港的公園構築防禦工事，花木砍倒，椅欄搗碎，昔日遊憇之地，現已變成一片荒邱，告羅士打行，統一碼頭和尖沙咀碼頭的大鐘，都已橫遭破壞，不能報時。日人爲着實施戒備，封鎖了許多通路，最顯著的是：連貫西環海岸干諾道與德輔道之間的一段，入夜燈火黯然，儼如鬼域，而山頂路燈，昔日好像明珠成串的，現已杳無蹤影。</p>
<p>日人事帶給港的醜相，也極爲顯著，日人移去香港島上最高山的扯旗山正頂的三支旗杆，却在當日香港戰事發生得最猛烈的灣仔山上，建築了一座所謂「忠靈塔」，形式抽笨，遠近可見，令人生慊。日人改建了香港總督府，飛閣屼立，頂蓋黃瓦，與其鄰近的粉白色高厦和靑翠的山崗，很不調和。昔日香港島上的橙黃色的公共汽車，九龍對岸碧綠色的公共汽車和穿梭似的金邊「的士」Taxi，現已蕩然無存。（自十月一日起，軍政府已把少數殘餘改塗深灰色的公共汽車，交回承商行駛，整個九龍半島，祗得六輛！）代用的交通工具，是脚踏車和三輪車。試看一個盛裝的少婦坐上脚踏車的車後，或兩三名靑年紳士被當作貨物似的由三輪車運過街頭，這是何等的景象！</p>
<h3 id="c50">一般物價　較戰時漲四五倍 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>戰前的香港，令人留戀之處，不一而足，而其生活程度的低下，尤爲一般所難忘。但今日的香港，一般物價已比戰時高漲到四倍至五倍之多。舉例來說：淸晨上茶館去，戰前五分錢一碟的點心，現已漲至兩角至三角。戰前買一斤牛肉，衹需四角，現需二元。普通蔬菜，戰前每斤五分至八分，現售二角至四角，普通房屋，戰前每層月租三十元者，現已索取一百元至一百五十元。上等皮鞋，戰前每雙十五元至二十元，現非百元買不到手，普通西服，戰前每套三四十元，現在至少需二百五十元至三百元。戰前兩分錢可購閱一份報紙，現在則要一角。商務中華出版的書籍，戰前照定價九折，現照定價加四倍出售。舟車方面，戰前電車收費三等三分，頭等六分，現在三等八分，頭等角半。公共汽車，戰前二等五分，頭等一角，現在一律二角。渡海小輪收費，頭等沒有增加，但三等已由戰前的三分漲至五分。黃包東的車資，戰前起碼一角，現在要二角。</p>
<h3 id="c51">當局行政　實施物價新對策 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>物價中比較沒有什慶上漲的，則爲柴米兩項。米每元五斤，柴每扒六元，都依公價出售，幷無黑市。這點，不得不設是港政府行政的特殊優點，値得在這兒强調一下，或許可供國人參考。</p>
<p>記者執筆至此，順便想談談香港當局處理當前生活指數高漲問題的對策。他們把握通貨緊縮的鐵　，指令公務人員以至其他商業機關的員工，一律按照戰前標準發薪，但爲應付目前的需求，不分等級，另加生活津貼三十元，這顯然仍是「入不敷支」，當局認爲這是過渡時期的現象，須要大家理解而且忍受的。因爲港元的外匯比率，已經決定每港元折合英金一先令兩便士，現在物價高漲的原因，主要的是由於供應系統尚未完全恢復，將來交通暢行，商場復甦，貨物湧到，則物價祗有步步下跌，斷無上漲之理。英國航運局巳抽調大批船隻，載貨前來遠東，同時已派出船隻，從印度載運煤斤和雜貨來港，協助當局把物價的高潮平抑卞去。記者通日分訪各方面的商人，他們憑信上述的理由，都以爲香港當前生活高漲之苦是暫時的。這句話也許可作國內人民源源移居香港的一個註釋，但正確與否尚有待於後來事實的證明。</p>
<h3 id="c52">全副新裝　新一軍過港北上 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>現在源源來港的人，除老百姓外，還有我國過港北上的新一軍部隊。那批全副新裝備的健兒，駐紥於過去日軍把民房改成的營地。營內都是小洋房，樹木相間，景色幽美，位於香港對岸九龍塘北部。中有曠場一片，與南部的民房隔開。曠塲之上，國軍築起司令台一座，高懸國旗，引爲壯觀。曠場之下，商人特設一個臨時小市塲，專供國軍採購食糧和燃料。營地之前，有一條廣闊馬路（窩打老道），直達市區。記者昨晨前往參觀，途中見有國軍三大隊早操後通過市區，精神弈弈，步伐整齊。日本傷兵多人，由女護士扶持，自路旁的敎堂（已被日人改作傷兵醫院）憑窓下瞰，記者私心頗自慶幸，能够看見這個不尋常的鏡頭，但不知那三五蝦夷心中，正作何感想耳！</p>
<p>由廣州來港的國軍最高長官潘裕昆師長，跟現任香港陸軍司令菲士廷少將是當年緬甸戰場上的舊相識。港中僑胞，乍覩國軍的雄姿，感念其對祖國的偉大貢獻，紛紛舉辦慰勞工作。港九區三民主義靑年團發起招待國軍運動，已徵得各大電影院和酒樓茶室的同意，免費招待國軍。</p>
<h3 id="c53">首批國軍　港僑熱烈招待 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>第一批國軍百餘人，已於八日由靑年團領導參觀各處，在大同酒家吃茶點，在娛樂戲院看電影，然後興盡而返。此外，還舉行了勞軍音樂會，發起了擦鞋籌款勞軍運動等，而新一軍政治部爲宜達政府對僑胞關懷的德意和加强僑胞對光榮勝利的認識，亦派港澳慰問團來港。港僑對祖國的聯絡，於此益見緊密。粵省主席羅卓英將軍，繼廣州市市長陳策將軍後，已於十日來港，藉答目前英軍高級將領訪問廣州之聘——中英邦交的親切，對今日的香港實具有極大的影響。（十二月十日寄自香島）</p>
<h3 id="c54">紗花粉麥　價格之檢討 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 朱述訓</p>
<p>日來本市物價，跌風漸熾，人民生活，此後自可漸入正軌，不過翻閱最近各報之經濟新聞，深覺本市工業製成品之價格，與農產品原料之價格，彼此距離尚遠，殊不適合。推厥原因，一部分廠商，似未能從大處落　，茲舉主要商品如棉紗，棉花，麵粉，小麥之價格，據討如后。</p>
<p>主要商品價格檢討</p>
<p>前週（十二月三日至八日）二十支雜牌紗價格盤旋於四十萬元左右，十六支紗約三十萬元左右，原棉二十支原料通州細絨價每祖的四五萬元之間，十六支原料太倉粗絨約三萬元光景，設以二十支棉紗一件，須用原棉三担半，每祖以四萬元計，則原棉成本每件不過十四萬元，加　開繳費用約八萬元，併上利潤，廿支紗一件，合成本總不致超過二十萬元，然事實上售價在四十萬元以上。（爾時報載申新廠二十支雙馬紗最高價爲六十四萬，最底爲四十八萬）同時，市場上掉紗交易，普通須以原棉十担左右，交換棉紗一件，設以上列事實核實，則原棉六担左右，即可交換棉紗一件。（原料三担半，加開繳費二担半。）更有進者，吾人更可將太平洋戰爭前及八一三抗戰前紗花成本討核一下，以明戰爭前後棉紗與原料（棉花）相互交換率之不同。</p>
<p>約民國二十八年五月，本報經濟欄刋有龍駒生「紗布前途之隱憂」一文，中有（二十支原料的美棉米特林每担八十二元九角，印棉白洛去七十二元一角，統扯八十九元左右，以每件紗用花三百五十斤計算，花成本須二百八十元，再加上開繳費的四十元，均以紡二十支論有的廠家開繳費須四五十元，開繳費中製造費二十元，管理費連營業費十五元，財務費五六元，每件紗的總成本，就須三百二三十元了，現在市售三百八九十元，每件紗約可賺六七十元……）可知在民國二十八年，紗價約四百元，而花價的八十元，則五担棉花可掉得棉紗一件，更追溯以前，蔣迪光氏在「社會經濟月報」三卷三期，著有「民國二十四年棉業之回顧」一文，對於該年標準紗花市價，有極詳細之統計，現節錄二十四年十二月份統計表如下：</p>
<p>二十四年十二月份標準紗花市</p>
<p>價比較表（單位元）</p>
<p>標準棉紗　最高　二〇二·〇〇</p>
<p>最低　一九一·九〇</p>
<p>平均　一九六·九〇</p>
<p>標準棉花　最高四三·〇〇</p>
<p>最低　四〇·四五</p>
<p>平均　四一·二七</p>
<p>根據此表，可知八一三前棉紗一件，尚掉不到五担棉花，所以現時市場上所謂掉紗交易，在戰前平均的以五担棉花，即可交換棉紗一件，換言之，即棉紗一件，合原棉五担左右之代價，與自今市價，以十担棉花掉紗一件，恰增一倍，是否合理，實不能無疑。</p>
<p>價格距離不應過遠</p>
<p>雖然，廠商有廠商的苦衷，目前如動力，製備，生產，管理，拆息等等費用之浩大，無可諱言。不過，吾人總希望事業基礎要從大處着想，要準備得相當堅固，耳光要望遠處着眼，這是一般人必須認識淸楚的一點，現在已不是敵僞的盤踞侵佔剝削時代，現在是我們自力的復興更生時代。原料與成品之間的價格，距離不應使牠過遠，因爲（一）原料價格低，就要影響到牠的生產力，同時吾人亦非維護高價原料政策，吾人只要認爲合理，合乎以物換物的自然水準—雖然易物交易是暫時的—（二）成品價格高，將使社會上　買力趨於薄弱，至於本市之主要食品麵粉價格，前週每包（四十四斤）在二千五百元左右，然原料小麥價格，每百斤亦僅二千五百元，近日粉麥市價標準，亦依此爲轉移；普通吾人僅知小麥每祖可出麵粉大七十斤，其餘麩皮三四十斤供製造等費用，則四十四斤之麵粉一包，與原料小麥一百斤，換同等之價格，其趨勢之不合理，實與上述之紗花情形相仿。（日來麵粉廠之物物交換，的百包麵粉易百担小麥）所以，此種違乎自然原則，而仍在勝利復興途中存在着的畸形價格，吾們必須要糾正牠，吾則，不能認爲合理。筆者特鄭重提出，希望廠商，特別注意。善後救濟總署方面，在發售平價救濟麵粉時，亦望按照國內外小麥成本，製造費用，而後核定麵粉之合理售價，以輕人民之負担。總而言之，希望將原料及成品之價格，迅予以合理之調整，並埋頭於業務上之努力！（移酬助學）</p>

<p>十六日本報曾揭載了一篇震　心魂的南京特約通訊，其中描寫殘酷陰險的日軍是如何的表演着他們一貫的暴虐在，簡直令人髮指。現在，我們要暴露歐洲法西斯德意志——也就是日本的所謂同盟　——樣表演着他們的罪行，如果細心的讀者把這兩篇通訊對照一看，至少可以明瞭德日兩國是世界上兩個殺人不眨眼的殘暴成性的孿生兄弟，而其後果所及，一切非人性的壞蛋遭到慘敗與毀滅，也自有其必然之理。本文作者葛甫雷。安德遜（Godfrey　H.　B.　Anderson）係聯合社戰地通訊員，在菲洲爲德軍俘獲後爲美第一軍釋放，此文係追述此納粹黨殺人工廠之內情，讀之令人毛骨悚然。——編者</p>
<p>一座瘋人院　恐怖窒息了人心</p>
<p>我走進哈達瑪殺人工塲，正像先我而進的那四萬個人。但，我並像那四萬個人，因爲我又活着走了出來。</p>
<p>從一九四三年九月至一九四五年二月，整了十八個月中，我眼看那些『病人』送邇進哈達瑪瘋人院，走進那雙重的木門裏。他們沒有再出現，但新人仍源源而來。</p>
<p>我是個俘虜，在附近一個集中營裏與三百個美國和多米尼亞軍官關閉在一起。離這裏幾百碼外，山谷的對面，就是那所陰暗的紅牆上漆着紅十字的哈達瑪瘋人院。</p>
<p>每星期，山谷下開到一列火車，載着些老弱的男女。有時還有孩子。白衣的醫生白帽的護士，扶着他們上山坡來。木門開着讓他們進去，就不見他們再出來了。</p>
<p>我們俘虜間，常說笑話：「現在那裏面恐怕要六個人睡一張床了，」每次火車到來時，我們總這樣說。</p>
<p>一天早晨，一個同伴看到一批抬擔架的人，從瘋人院的後面走上山來，走到山頂，他們擱下了幾塊木板，接着把擔架一提，衹見有包裏似的東西，滾了下去。他們除去木板，就很忽促地走下山了。</p>
<p>此後，每天破曉，我們就窺看，所見總是一樣。不論冬·夏·睛·雨·雪，那些包裏總是抬上山去，葬在千人塚內。</p>
<p>我同營裏的德國衛兵談起這事，他說：「不必你費心。德人很人道地殺了他們，也通知了他們的家屬，你不必費心，因爲這不平你們的事。」</p>
<p>後來在美第一軍釋放我的七個月後，也就是離這次哈達瑪案公審的幾星期後，我乘着一輛吉普車，走進那所陰暗的建築物，碰開了門，走進裏面。</p>
<p>人類的肉煙　從毒氣室裏噴射</p>
<p>「這是毒氣室。」院長說。這是一間磚牆的小室，破裂的氣管仍夾在牆壁裏，原來的進入口已用磚砌沒，裏面收拾得十分澈底，已看不出成千人在這裏受苦死亡的痕跡。</p>
<p>毒氣室隔壁是太平間，內有大理石檯二隻，裝着自來水管，另外，有幾瓶化學藥品和一些外科用具。</p>
<p>另外，我們又看了些地窰，裏面整潔地堆着番薯。最後是到了鍋爐間。在這裏，屍體都經過大怕的火化，一些也不留痕跡。祗見兩個高烟囱聳立在院頂上，裏面曾帶着人類的肉烟，吹向可空我們走過刷白的走廊，沿廊都是綠色的門。他用鑰匙一個個開了，等我看過又一一鎖好。我看過了男病房和女病房，是刷白的牆，木桌上陳着黃花，很是潔凈。那些病人呆呆地好像很自在，至少他們已不再怕什麼了。</p>
<p>但在一間病房要，一個婦人哭着把頭撞門，經護士勸住了她。從她身上，我們看到了今日法國所有慘劇的例子。她被轟炸嚇得發痴，她的孩子全死了。她祗是哭着，病狂地囈語着：唉，急性的神經衰弱症。那院長說。</p>
<p>我們接着走向地窖，在那狹狹的石級上。多少人踏上了死亡之路。黑色的鐵門開時，一陣恐怖的冷氣凝住了人的心，倒翻了人的胃。</p>
<p>當我們在曲折的路上走着時，院長把他的經歷告訴了我。他的名字是威廉·亞爾伐德，是精神病專科醫師，戰前曾在好幾個藏人院裏服務過。</p>
<p>四萬個工人　埋入大集團墓塚</p>
<p>「在一九四一那年我告老了。」他說：「我很不造成納綷黨強」迫我們用精神病者來作訊騐。我擔心着這些事，結果病了，他們就允許我告退。但本年五月，滬醫院的院長被調，他們又呌了我回去。現在，我要照顧三百六十個病人，雖然心裏很沉重，但至少我可以盡力照顧他們了。」</p>
<p>他說毀滅病人的命令是從柏林內政部發下的。往往送來一張名單，把要毀滅的人名圈出。他們告訴這裏的醫生，說：這是希特勒元首的命令，禁止向外洩漏。</p>
<p>但通知屍屬時，祗說「某人病死。」</p>
<p>再走過幾間地下室後，我們重又回到光亮的地面。</p>
<p>「最先，他們用毒氣。」院長說：「接着，又用注射的方法作試騐。屍體不一定火化，有時候十五個或二十個一起埋葬在山頂上。你們是常常能看到的。」</p>
<p>窗戶開了，裏面伸出一個人頭。我向他說：我要見這裏的院長。院長是個傴僂的老人·光頭。對我閃着眼，好像有些恐懼。我要求參觀這所醫院，他說：「當然可以！」</p>
<p>在山頂一排排墳墓上的黃花，迎風飛舞，每一屍體埋葬後祗用木板漂出一個號碼，這號碼現在已達五百號左右了。</p>
<p>「在這些集體塚墓裏另外當然還埋着許多人。」院長說：可是沒有人知道多少。據說有四萬名德，波，俄籍的工人，埋在這裏，但沒有記錄，也沒有痕跡，我們恐怕永遠不會知道是眞是假了。」</p>
<p>接着，我們又去看孩童公墓，祗見十三個墳上祗有一個標着名字。那是個很大的木十字，牠的陰影罩着那被謀害了的孩子。</p>
<p>孩子逃性命　竟被納粹兵追踢</p>
<p>我記得，有一天，我從俘虜營眺望對面的山坡，曾見一個孩子哀求着逃命。那是一個夏天的黃昏，那孩子從紅牆的醫院裏奔出來，好像野動物在蘋果樹林裏逃躲。他背後跟着三個男人，手表執着槍，但他們不發彈，祗是追着他來回跑，像在捉逃藏。結果，孩子被他們抓住，拖回來踢着掙扎着。</p>
<p>我在離開那陰慘的山谷前，曾到從前的俘虜營去看了一眼，見到幾個美國駕駛貨車的兵，正在我熟悉的那些房間裏徘徊。</p>
<p>在庭園前，空酒瓶堆成了小丘，鐵絲網已被拉倒，木製的哨兵亭也不見了。一羣德國孩子，正用木柵准着在生野火，一個戴着德國軍　的孩子見我走過，喊這：「　，橡皮糖有嗎，先生？」</p>

<h3 id="c57">昆明學生應速復課 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>昆明學潮，已逾半月。蔣主席旣有懇切的訓告，擲彈主犯且已伏法，政府在事後措施也大致妥善；加以滇省盧主席負責調處，谷界父老及各社團領袖數度奔走，爲死者善後及家屬撫卹等事有所安排；允其是聯大·雲大·英專·中法四校敎授素爲靑年學子所敬愛的，也都舌敝唇焦，苦勸復課，且已於前日按時鳴鐘，各赴敎室。按常情推測，昆明學　宜可告一結束，久輟絃歌，庶幾得以復聞。詎知昨日昆明電訊，一則謂前日上午已有學生三五成羣上課，而下午迫於罷課委員會的命令，課室又闃無一人；再則謂雲大敎授勸告同學，勿失多方面之同情；三則謂滇省社團致函四校學生自治會，因其屢翻成議，似未能代表全體學生之公意，故不願再與商談。遠道傳聞，雖眞相未明，　昆明學生迄今猶未復課，所希求者何事，實令人百思而不得其解。</p>
<p>昆明學生最初罷課，意在「反對內戰」。其實先應研究：所謂「內戰」，定義如何？原因安在？反對之法宜取何途？今置一切不問，而逕以籠統的「反對內戰」爲罷課之號召，因此犧牲其學業光陰，是否得計，已成問題。迨因罷課爭執而釀成死傷學生，官廳應付張皇，遂生枝節。社會同情，政府懷念，乃有主席之訓告，當局之懲兄，敎授之勸導，各界之調處。這無非大家重視敎育，愛護靑年，絕不願見莘莘學子長此犧牲其學業。昆明四校學生，大抵近於成年，滿腔熱血，憂慮國事，志旣可嘉，情亦可諒。但如只知堅執罷課，以此爲唯一武器，則試問今日兇犯已懲，善後可商，靑年學生尚復何求，樂於荒廢光陰？須知天下最寳貴者同情，而同情之爲物，可得而亦可失，全看自身行爲之合理與吾。昆明學生，懸崖勒馬，今殆其時！　大凡羣衆運動，往往操縱於少數人之運用，而此少數人者，非爲公開之領袖，即屬慕中之策士，所謂羣衆者不知不覺間已成爲他人玩弄之工具。學生爲有理智之靑年，自不致甘爲工具，然羣衆心理，經一二人之渙汗大號，往往爲情感所驅，爲威勢所迫，相與奔馳追逐而不自知，此時理智早已失其作用。昆明學生前日上午旣已有人上課，而下午又復罷課，其癥結所在，不難想像。半月以前，或傳昆明學潮有其背景，陰謀策士，企圖以罷課而造成慘案，以慘案而擴大罷課，復以罷課而牽動他界，蔓延他處，使滇垣一地之事，成爲可以燎原之星火。但曠觀世局，此時中　豈宜再事紛擾？豈容再有搗亂？一切問題儘可磋商，而不能挾有偏見，視同敵對。即就昆明學生原意而言，無非反對內戰，則目前共黨代表，千呼萬喚，幸而到渝，政治協商會議不日可開，政府亦當能虛懷討論，和平商談，祗要共黨不再逞兵，戰事定可頓息，何必再勞學生荒其學業？若謂死傷學生善後措施，則政府旣決心妥辦，各界亦紛願洽商，自有社會中堅負其責任，斷　致令學生失望。學生諸君縱以政府爲不可信，豈社團領袖。學校敎授而亦盡不可信？我們誠懇希望，昆明學生此時應速復課，惟有如此，纔可說是恢復理智的行動，而不純粹爲感情所驅使。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，昆明爲後方學府雲集之地，愛好自由爲一般青年學生之天性，而敎授之薰陶，學者之倡導，亦使昆明年來成爲政治活動之重鎭，黨派紛爭之焦點。推演激盪之所至，不幸而竟有學潮。故學潮雖爲學生之事，而造成此次學潮者，政府與社會應負其責，而靑年學生實爲無辜。然學生究不能因恃其自身爲靑年，可邀他人之原諒。而遂不顧一切，不問事理，罷課到底。旣稱學校，總須敎書；旣號學生，總應上課。天下斷無長此停課之學校，更無永久罷課之學生。昆明學生恢復上課　時機，今已不可再事延誤。雲大敎授勸告書中所說勿使學校基礎爲之動搖，語重心長，深願靑年學生三思之！</p>

<p>近日統債欣欣向上，已竄出七百大關，推其原因，雖爲投機者操縱壟斷所致，然金融界銀行界吸進不少，據內地來人言：「國府自西遷後，統債利息自卅一年起停止發給，抽　雖繼續舉行，但中籤者亦未還本，由於此點，故人民猜測，政府有獎勵公債之希望。</p>

<p>〔中央社台北十七日電〕記者前月在全台各地訪問二十餘日，今日欲向國人特別提及者，即台灣目前最需要者，爲第一流之思想家，敎育家，哲學家與大學者。</p>
<p>盡力驅制</p>
<p>蓋日木過去在台之敎育政策，僅准台胞向醫學與技術諸方面發展，在思想與學術上，則盡力壓制。故今日此兩項人才，適成畸形發展，台灣之專才與技術人才，如能加上思想之潤澤，與崇高理想之黨涵，渠等將不僅爲第一流之專家，且亦將爲建國之棟樑。內地第一流學術界權威，如能在此時組織台灣訪問團，來台作五十年來祖國學術公開講演與系統介紹，對台胞敎育當極有裨益。其次即台灣目前需要吃大苦與大努力，台灣固有豐富之資源，但資源之開發，非努力吃苦，事實上不能使合灣成爲理想中之富裕。</p>
<p>情形嚴重</p>
<p>台灣素稱日本之倉庫，而目前各處感到食問題之嚴重，即糖產亦發生問題，其原因除肥料來源缺乏外，台灣本身雨量過足，甘蔗種植期較長，成本高，不能與外糖競爭，亦爲大難題。渦去日本所以用國家力量，培植台糖，並使外糖不能侵入合糖市場之原因，即日本本土無糖。其次記者欲提及文字，台胞目前所用文字，絕大多數皆爲日化中文，而適與公署所用之「等因」「奉此」成一對照。</p>
<p>格格難讀</p>
<p>記者曾閱讀某糖業專家，上陳長官書，對目前台灣所貢獻之意見，確有特殊見解，惟其日化中文，實有格格難讀之苦。台胞從事於徵師工作者，不乏其人，渠等將來執行職務時，對公文程式與中文字句使用，亦大感不慣。</p>

<p>本報與同德醫學院聯合主辦之助學金中美籃球義賽，昨晚爲最後二塲，節目相當精彩，球迷不避寒風，紛紛以來，助學熱忱，殊足感佩，本報及同德醫學院對球員之精彩表演與球迷之踴躍參加，均表示無限感謝。</p>
<p>拍賣義球</p>
<p>第二塲半場時，由潘公展先生主持拍賣義球，由一萬元開價，各善士羣相爭購，開價扶搖直上，頃刻間增至八萬九萬，終由章志鴻大善士以十萬元購去。繼由潘先生給獎旗，與賽各隊，均領得獎旗一面。</p>
<p>未分勝負</p>
<p>華聯與美海靑首先交鋒，裁判金伯陶陳寳琳，海靑下馬施威，傑卡司基胡資先後中的，以四對〇領先。華聯不慌不忙，吳成章·陳學崇·李震中大顯威風，頃刻間以四對四超出，海青一籌莫展，此時華聯突調換陣容，張良雄·陳祚良相繼出場，調出孔廣益·李震中，陣脚一鬆，海靑乘此大舉進攻，活躍於時，華聯頗有格格難入之槪，上半時終造成各二十三之局而，未分勝負。</p>
<p>成竹在胸</p>
<p>下半時華聯重用最標準陣綫上場，唯海靑之聲勢已盛，故分數此起彼落，二五·二七，二九·三一，四度平等，緊張之至，事實上華聯技高一着，李震中·吳成章·勃脫乘時活躍，分數乃得節節前導。在四七比四三華聯佔先時，海靑胡資以四次犯規畢業，愛金生出場大有孤注一擲之勢，又逼成各四七之局面。觀衆莫不爲華聯提心吊胆，華聯將士胸有成竹，李震中又見逞威，瞬間疊獲三球，終以五五對四七勝美海靑。</p>
<p>穩紮穩打</p>
<p>第二塲中靑對奧西納，裁判由久不見面之瞿鴻律與陳亮搭配，大戰在敎育局顧局長毓琇主持開球禮中展開。中青用緩攻策，林維聰首開紀錄，再加一球，儼然以四對〇佔先，奧隊却立登即顯威，林維聰果然不錯，一擲一罰，旭蒙得一球，七對四〇中靑依然佔前，奧隊旭蒙又見中的，分數逐漸追上，七—七後，遂被超出，中靑謹愼從事，不肯放鬆，以穩紥穩打之法制之，奧隊惠勒·旭蒙射必有中，致使中青莫能抬頭，僅努力追隨，上半時奧隊以二十二對十七勝，中靑僅落後五分。</p>
<p>主將缺席</p>
<p>球賽繼給獎儀式後再度展開，奧西納愈戰愈勇，勃巴旭蒙之隻手探籃，神出鬼沒，瞬間以三一對一九佔優勢，中靑以姚文彝調出劉福善，擬取覓籃之道，無奈對方守禦殊嚴，依然亳無進展，反之，奧隊之氣已盛，左突右衝，無往不利，中淸因圖急進，却見慌亂異常，以致無法接近，直至鑼聲響處，奧西納以四十一對二十九勝中靑。中靑昨夜以主將馬燦希之缺席，失却領導入物，以致打來散沙一盤，不勝可惜。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海高等法院在提籃橋上海監獄內，於昨日下午二時，特組合議庭，審訊漢奸陳日平。出席審判官長計有劉庭長　桂，林檢察官我明，祝推事宗海，曹推事駿，曁王書記官蘭屏。先由林檢察官宣續起訴要旨：謂陳逆於民國二十七年五月，任僞組織「立法委員」，同年十二月，任「國庫司司長」及「財政部常務次長」。二十八年五月任「華興銀行」監察人，三十二年八月，任「上海市政府第一區公署經濟處長」，三十三年五月任「上海市諮詢委員」，同年十月，任前「新聞報副社長」。陳逆任僞職多年，劣跡昭彰，現經調查明確，依漢奸懲治條例第二條第一款謀敵國反抗本國罪，提起公訴，希望貴庭長依法嚴懲。</p>
<p>提籃橋上海監獄內，昨日由高院組合議庭，公開審訊陳逆日平。爲被告辯護者有錢·張·趙三律師，除趙外，錢張均準時到庭。圖中穿長服站立，雙手相攏者即係陳逆，正在庭長前供述一切。其後坐着穿法衣者爲辯護律師之一。</p>
<p>被告供述曾任僞職</p>
<p>繼由陳逆陳述供職僞職及被捕經過，略謂於民國二十七年受日人大　茂之誘惑，同年五月，上海各小報突然刋載被告任「立法委員」，因當時環境惡劣，弄假成眞，始入歧途。雖屢任僞職，但並無通敵叛國，壓迫欺詐等。尤其任「新聞報副社長」時，竭力推行社會福利事業，與救濟事業。至於一切經費，從無一分錢歸入私囊。如在各任僞職中，能發現被告確曾有危害邦國，欺壓人民者，決願受槍斃極刑</p>
<p>庭上審訉被捕經過</p>
<p>庭上訊其被捕經過，據答：被告前住環龍路三十七號第五十七號房間，於本年九月十五日，因英人要將該房收回自用，經一葡籍外人介紹，乃遷入同屋五十四號。焉知該房爲朝鮮人曾任敵方情報員，突然回來，被告正與該人談話時，憲兵前來逮捕此朝鮮人，被告遂連同被捕。最後陳逆曾　請審判長，要求發還寓所，啓封財物，以維妻女生活。劉庭長對僞職務曾加訊及，陳逆一一作答。庭上再出示當時陳逆媚敵所著之「大東亞」戰爭論文，及僞府贈予之獎章，陳逆言語支吾，　强作答。</p>
<p>罪嫌重大依法惑治</p>
<p>嗣後　庭長宣告辯論開始，林檢察即起立謂，陳逆受高深敎育，向甘爲敵方利用，證據確　，並於任「新聞報副社長」時，專爲敵方宣傳，按照漢奸懲治條例第二條第一款之罪，實無容狡辯。自二十七年迄今，附逆嫌疑重犬，所謂曾推行福利事業，　不足以减輕其應　之罪名，理應依法懲治。</p>
<p>生長日本認識淺薄</p>
<p>旋被告律師錢乃文即起立　護，謂被告自幼師受日本敎育之薰淘，對祖國不免認識淺薄，其責任在於我國過去數十年對國外僑胞敎育之失敗。且西歐谷國往往有出生該國之外僑，應接受出生國之義務，在作戰時本國祗能認作敵人，而不視作叛國者。又被告擔任偽職之動機，在於誘迫所致。再者，被告任僞職時，並無貪汚枉法之事，且對社會福利事業推行頗爲熱心，依懲治條例第三條末項條文，請求從寬發落。繼張煜基律師亦起立辯護。最後劉庭長宣告辯論結束，定本月二十二日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>本報記者昨獲可靠消息，現覊押於各特別看守所內之大漢奸，已在陸續押送至提籃橋臨時看守所。由此可知不久即將繼小漢奸而逐一公開審訊矣。</p>
<h3 id="c80">外商辦產權手續　市府令飭制止 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>本市過去以租界關係，外商僑民向我國人購租土地，除由我國政府發給永租契或道契外，同時向各該國領事館註册辦理，此項註册手續，共目的爲征收各該國在滬僑商之財產稅，即過去所稱之地捐。我國政府受條約關係，不再向外商僑民征收田賦，或其他土地捐。因而一般不肖之徒，競向外人轉購土地，由外人附給權柄單，以爲產權移轉之憑證。該項土地買賣後，並不向我國政府移轉登記或推收，以圖逃避賦稅，若干外商即專以買賣土地爲營業，故有「掛號」及「大過戶」「小過戶」等畸形現象，實屬侵害我國主權。今租界已收回，自行予以糾正。業經市政府制定「上海市地政局處理永租契或道契，土地登記暫行辦法，」公佈施行。市地政局以最近查有英商愛爾德洋行等十四家外商，不明我國法令，在各報刊登重行辦理產權手續，妨害土地整理計劃，昨呈報市政府轉飭制止。聞市府已令社會局轉飭各該洋行停止此種營業，並函外交部駐滬特派員查明，以維國權。</p>

<p>— 平齊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕抗戰勝利以前，在上海寄一封本埠平信，至少要隔兩天才能送到；現在，你祗要是上午投寄，往往在當天便能收到了。</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局的王幫辦裕光，告訴記者說：「我們正在逐步改進中，郵局業務的發達，和交通情形有密切的關係，目前南北洋的郵政雖因種種關係，還沒有恢復正常狀態，但信件還是可以通的。接收東北郵政的人員，曾一度折返北平，但不久當即可出關執行任務。寄到歐美的航空郵件，目前除中阿航空公司的飛機外，有時也借重盟邦的便機代帶。到歐美和印度去的航空信，是經由重慶特寄的，到南洋去的信，則經由香港。」</p>
<p>郵局盈虧通盤打算</p>
<p>郵費增加之後，有一時期在民衆間似乎有一點誤會，以爲漲得太多了。王帮辦說，「誠然，從北四川路寄一封信到南京路要郵費二十元，似乎太貴，可是你從上海寄一封信到新疆，郵費却也祗有二十元呢！」郵政的盈虧，是應該把全國的情形作通盤打算的，在目前全國交通還是相當困難的時候，郵費雖然已經增加，恐怕還是很難收支相抵的。</p>
<p>據本報重慶訊，過去郵局每月虧累平均約四億元，加價前後的比較是：九月份單郵費一項收入一〇八，〇〇八，五〇〇元。十月份（加價後）爲四三七，七五八，九〇〇元。前後相差三倍。但十月份總收入爲五八七，一三六，五〇〇元，支出爲七六五，一三七，四〇〇元，結果仍虧累一七八，〇〇〇，九〇〇元。以上海一處而論，盈餘了二四，〇六三，八〇〇元，十一月份的業務更形發達，自然盈餘更多了。</p>
<p>長江流域收寄包裹</p>
<p>現在，在長江流域一帶，包裏已經恢復收寄了。記者因爲上海有不少人正急於想看到從英美寄來的書籍雜誌，所以特爲問王帮辦這種印刷品，目前是否已經可以郵寄。王帮辦的答覆是：「你看！」原來他自己剛剛接到一捲美國寄來的雜誌四本全新的“TimesWeek”。不過因爲外匯率沒有公佈，所以現在想匯欵到外國書店去是不可能的，祗要外匯率一發表，我們就可以訂購外國書報了　勝利以前，敵僞因爲郵政局不是賺錢的機關，所以抱一種任其自生自滅的態度。那時候，郵局經濟極感困難，不但員工的生活難以維持，而且竟至郵件愈多，虧蝕反而愈大。現在則一切已加調整，全局三千員工，多少已經得到了比較合理的待遇。至於有一部份曾負責組織僞「郵務工會」的職員，却已悉數開除。</p>
<p>以前，郵政局有不少外籍高級職員，現在却減少得多了。他們筆路藍縷的功績，是値得我們感謝的。即如以前在上海的法國籍的乍配林氏，就着實爲維護我國的郵政而費了不少心血，然而他沒有來得及看見現在上海郵局業務蒸蒸日上的情形他在我們勝利之前死了，死在上海。</p>

<h3 id="c106">美國文藝的介紹 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>前天到南京路兜了一轉，在伊文思圖書公司·中美圖書公司等處看看，所　的全是舊書，新書簡直沒有，刊物只有本地的英文報紙。再到專賣雜誌的大華雜誌公司一看，桌上堆的全是幾年前的舊雜誌，新雜誌連影子也沒有。</p>
<p>今天到沙遜大厦美國新聞處去觀光，就大不相同了。這是供給給民衆閱覧的公開的圖書館，把美國的政治·經濟·科學·文學·工藝·農業……各方面介紹給上海人士。任何人都可以進去。我去的時候，室內已經坐滿四長桌的讀者，大門旁的桌上所放的雜誌以農業·醫學·商業的爲多。其中有兩　文學刋物，一種是「星期六文學評論」，一種是「劇塲藝倆月刊」；前者約十本，後者是八月號和九月號的，八月號有長文談到美國「音樂喜劇」的昨日和今日。這使我憶起我爲「小說月報」按月編寫的「國外文壞消息」，從民國十六年六月，一直編到二十年十二月，四年半以來，從來不曾　斷過，材料都由商務印書館供給，徐調孚時常把一大疊英美的雜誌抱了來給我，這其中就有「星期六文學評論」和「劇塲藝　」，後者在復旦大學圖書館也保存了不少。想不到這兩種刋物滬能維持得這樣長久，隔了十四年，還在繼續出版，比起我們許多的短命刊物，眞是不可同日而語了！不過「屋期六文學評論」以前有各國文學概况的通信，現在沒有了，這是一個缺　。</p>
<p>在書架上還有不少書，裏間的一排書架，大部分放的是工程·技術·理化一類的專門科學書籍，外間的三個書架，中間的一個，大部分放的是文藝書。就記憶所及，的有下列各書引起了我的注意：一本「美國的民俗學」，其中搜集了不少美國的神話，故事和歌謠；還有「美國的繪畫」，「美國的浪漫畫派」，「美國的照相藝術」都附了長篇的介紹和精美的插圖；劇本彙列也不少，例如「現代美國劇二十種」（此書已銷十版左右），「美國戲劇代表作十六種」之類；還有一種「愛國詩文選」，大的是抗戰文藝，但不一定是純文藝，政治論文似乎不少。我想找一本「戰時美國文學」，就是談論美國在大戰時文學上的成就的，可惜不曾找到。其他如惠特曼的「草葉集」，劉易士的小說「愛羅史密司」等，也有好些種。</p>
<p>「蘇聯文藝」已經出了十六期，內容很有精采。美國新聞處的同人如莎士比亞全集的譯者曹未風先生等，是否有興致來一個「美國文議」呢？而我們精通英文的文友們，我也希望他們能帶一支鉛筆，一些紙張到美國新聞處去譯點東西出來，以作溝通東西文化的工作；或者有興致去瀏覽，也是好的。附帶聲明一句，我並非美國新聞處的職員，他們也不曾託我宣傳，我只是同聲相應地自動的來介紹的。想知道一點美國文藝新作的，請不要忘記到美國新聞處去！</p>
<h3 id="c107">犧牲　〔績〕 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>歷史的短</p>
<p>與於期說話的時候，荊軻一直沉靜地聽着，他的臉色不時泛得雪白，彷彿思索着什麼似的。</p>
<p>『假如——』荊軻說，他說了這兩個字，又把話縮回來，看看樊於期，却改了主意，酌起酒來，勸大家喝酒，不願意再說了。</p>
<p>大家一邊喝，一邊又談着眼前緊張的局勢，國家已經臨到了患難，這些感懷傷時的人都充溢着滿懷激烈的情緒。尤其是荊軻，他報國心切，格外的激昂慷慨。他想到田光剛才所說的話，想到太子丹將怎樣的使用他，也想到高漸離所說許多人以爲「合縱」「述橫」都已經不及，衹有激勵士氣，以死報國的話。他猜度太子丹的要重用自己，也許就是要他以死報國。他能爲國效命的也祗有以死報國。那麼最簡捷的辦法，便是流血五步，把殘暴的泰王置之死地了。然而要這樣做法，也並不是輕易的事。剛才聽了秦王重價購買　　將軍頭顱這句話裏，他想到一個見秦王而實行流血五步的計劃了。想到這裏，他不免又向　於期看了一眼。</p>
<p>於期却欠起身子，說了一聲少陪，就逕自走出酒店走了。荊何忽然想到了什麼似的，並沒有向高漸離和狗屠告別，急急地跟蹤上去</p>
<p>『　將軍，我們酒澆愁腸，彼此都有滿腹的憂鬱。我不忍跟你匆匆分手，特地來陪你在星光底下走走。』</p>
<p>具於期想不到荊軻會　　上來，也想不到荊軻的話說得這樣親熱。流浪在異國，這種同情格外使他興奮感動，便接着說道：</p>
<p>『足下這樣誠，對於眼前的局面有沒有什麼高見？』</p>
<p>『我覺得情勢這樣急迫，天下人都受秦王的欺凌，應該用最簡捷的方法——』荊軻說到這裏停住了，目光烱烱地向樊於期看着。</p>
<p>『請問這個方法，能不能見告？』</p>
<p>『我想一死報祖國—樊將軍受了秦王的恥辱，父母宗族都給殺戳，不知道有什麼主意？』</p>
<p>荊軻看見樊於期雖然不就作答，臉上那種沉痛的樣子，不由得使他打了一個寒顫。</p>
<p>『我當然不惜犧牲，誓死報復，要除滅這個天下的强暴才好！』他說。</p>
<p>『我想單身去見秦王，找機會把他刺死，那是最簡捷的辦法，就可惜不遠千里而去，找不到一個見秦王的藉口……』在朦朧的星光底下，荊軻逼視着樊於期，他的聲音因爲過分的激動，不能再說下去。</p>
<p>他淸淸楚楚看見　於期全身一震，突然停住脚步，喃喃地說：『秦王重價購我頭顱，那麼我借重這位志士，爲天下除强暴的機會到了。』</p>
<p>當這句話說完的時候，樊於期拔出佩着的短劍，荊軻祗見寒光一閃，一顆淋滿鮮血的頭顱，正往他懷裏倒了下去。〔完）</p>
<h3 id="c108">『媽媽大夫』 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>思嘉—「飄」的女主角—的媽媽。並不是醫生，但她會給黑人看病。因此親戚　舍對她都很欽佩，覺得她太能幹了。甚至有人歸功到她的世系，以及家庭敎育。其實像郝思嘉媽媽那樣的母親，在我們前一代裏面也不少，我的媽媽就是一個。</p>
<p>我媽媽的診病天才，說起來比郝太太也許　高明些。郝太太祗能給女人們治個腹痛，給黑小子吃些打虫　。遇到傷寒之類的大病，便束手策了。我媽媽則不然，大病大到名醫搖頭的肺癆；小病小到魚骨鯁住　叫，她都能治。我姐姐的吐血病，便是她治愈的。至少已有十多年沒發了。</p>
<p>她有幾味『看家　』直到現在我還記得：</p>
<p>凡是孩子們鬧肚痛，十之八九是吃壞了，趕快熬一碗「山渣末」臨睡服下，天明即愈。夏天若是發冷，準是貪凉閉了汗，一服「午時茶」便百病全消。</p>
<p>外科方面，她有一種「神效藥水」。這藥水的配製方法，雖說是「祖傳」，但並非傳子不傳婿的「秘方」我可以在這裏公開介紹一下：</p>
<p>三錢雄黃，一塊明礬，投在一個瓦罐中，泡上一罐開水，在端午節的正午，放在太陽地裏狠晒，晒過午時，便將牠移置陰處。此後到了夏天，無論男婦老少，祇要你手指頭上紅腫，或者額角頭上生瘡，她便把那一罐「仙水」捧在手裏，一面盛讚道「外用藥水」的靈效；一面便輕輕地用洗凈的破毛筆醮一點兒給你在紅塊上抹上黃黃的一片。且無論其有效無效，便是那冰凉的感覺也是怪適意的。可是我們遇到這種局而，心裏多少總有點不高興。尤其到後來上了「洋學堂」，對媽媽這種「土辦法」更加反對。我們常常在背後稱她爲「媽媽大夫」。所謂「媽媽大夫」者，便相當於北方的「蒙古大夫」與南方的「江西郞中」甚至比她們更糟。因爲她旣無科學根據；又無名師傳授，簡直是「蠻幹」。但事實上她却很少悮過事。至今想來，她這一點全憑經騐而來的醫學智識，確也够令人欽佩！</p>
<p>現代美國，因爲社會福利事業的完備，已不再需要郝太太式的「媽媽大夫」存在了。中國呢？在這一代的媽媽中，至少已很少像我的媽媽那樣勇敢地担負全家大小內外方脈的衛生顧問，這在我個人想來却不免有些感慨！</p>

<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>「閘爲王者之香」，這是一句成語，是的，古人曾把蘭此喻是遺世獨立的君子，所以有「空谷國蘭」的說法，</p>
<p>我的故鄉家中，在天階種了幾盆蘭，已有二十多年了，雖然楓園裏還有許多奇花，但我最賞識和心愛的，還是這些蘭花。</p>
<p>可是現在一切似夢般過去了，那淸雅幽香的蘭花，還是常常使我回憶着，憧憬着，因爲她別具風致。她沒有妖冶，沒有嬌媚，她只是獨立的是淸高而姍靜。他的色，他的香，都是超塵絕俗的。四時都是披了淡靑色的外衣，輕紗裏現出點點紅潤的肌肉。笑着迎人，這是何等可愛的呢！她天生就有愛娣性的，一枝花總是連同生着四五個姊妹，同樣地都是高標絕俗淡雅淸奇，同樣地溫柔羞怯。那事亭玉立的風姿，也够使人陶醉留連了。古來許多文人墨客給她顚倒，崇拜，仰慕。我呢，雖然不是文人，對他也是特殊崇拜的一個。</p>
<p>我給她陶醉了，從前總是放心不下的，如同放不下愛伴的一樣依戀，離開她一天半夜，心裏總是眷戀不安。可是自從倭寇的魔於伸到我的故鄉來，一切都被罷殘了，故園的花木，怎樣的景况完全不知，尤其是幾盤蘭花是否無恙？天旱了，誰爲他澆水？花開了，有否給人家蹂躪？我每想着，不禁地似失去一顆心。現在倭寇崩潰了，不知牠能吾恢復常態。</p>
<p>故園的蘭花啊，你知道你的主人在萬里之外，常常惦念你的生長嗎？</p>

<p>— 吳仞之</p>
<p>一般的說來，世人都怕「麻煩」，祗有戇人發　勁的時候才是例外。</p>
<p>中國人對於心理學似乎有特殊的聰明，不必學習，也不必做許多的實騐，即便能够靈活地運用起來。譬如說，他要死啃着你的東西不放手，那末當你向他要還的時候，他便給你一個「麻煩」，使你知難而退。不過，這種的「麻煩」，却也必須有些勢力做憑藉。</p>
<p>在中國，似乎大大小小的事都落在這種的公式裘。</p>
<p>有人說我太崇拜歐美，他說美國的南北戰爭，法國大革命，都是大「麻煩」所引起的例子。我說這是政治，我對於政治的公式沒有工夫去研究。我這幹戱的在目前所汪意者只在戯院子。我懷疑：爲什麼接收下來的話劇院子會變成了電影院，而有直接產權的京戲院子倒還在演京戯？當我發現了上面的理由時，我才得到了一個解答。原來是：幹話劇的旣有搗「麻煩」的聰明勁，也沒有什麼勢力可憑藉。並且話劇圈裏也少　人，即有，也還沒有到發戇勁的時候。</p>
<p>話劇的失去院子，是爲了有些人犯了「人不爲已」的毛病。但是這却是「人不爲已」之外的又一解答。然而，怕「麻煩」也還是「爲己」，所以說起來也還在「人不爲已」的理由之內。「人不爲己」的毛病犯得大，「麻煩」的效用於是乎也就大矣。</p>

<p>治安問題，根本是社會問題。治安處理失策，社會當然失掉鞏固性基礎，國家常然也難能踏上建國復興的大道。筆者在這裏大聲疾呼，希望市政當局對大問題須迅速解決，小間題也絕不能放鬆，各區的秩序，尤應儘可能迅速處理。勝利後，也許是一重難關，我們的國運，不應該那麼千災百難，永無光明。如目前滬西曹家渡鎭。它是勞苦貧民的集中區域，因此良莠不齊，無形中成了特殊區域，雖然小漢奸賭台大王朱逆順林死了，但其手下徒子徒孫，寄子寄女等，竟無法無天，益見猖獗，如敲詐勒索，晚搶晨竊之外，近復變本加厲，秘密公開的開設黃牛棚，手段異常高妙。譬如上午設在白利南路立順里某號，下午就在曹家渡鎭三角塲附近某茶館店內，而晚上又在康腦脫路忻康里某號，甚至於一時三遷，棚外附近，派抱台脚若干名，均係化裝不同樣的小阪商，掩　局外人之耳目。但每天不知有多少靑年男女，在裏面消磨大好光陰，也不知有多少拋汗血掙來的金錢，白白送掉，這禍國殃民害人不淺的大魔窟的黃牛棚，在光明後的「新滬西」，還能寄生，眞是一個「滬西的惡癌」。希望警察當局，嚴懲這黃牛棚主持人及共餘黨，消滅這害人不淺的大魔窟。另一方面，希望滬西同胞，大家起來協助當局，維持治安，加强社會鞏固的基礎。</p>

<p>（四）調理進補乃姑息療法</p>
<p>肺病爲一種慢性結核病，調理進補，雖暫時稍能見效，但無人能保證其病之已經痊愈，亦無人能保證其將來之不復發。蓋頑强之結核病菌，絕非調理進補所能根本消滅，反之，因長期之調理進補，適予病菌以擴大活動之絕好機會，一旦爆發，　成燎原，不可收拾，悔恨無及，故調理進補，實屬姑息療法，不　養　貽患，希望一般賢明患者，勿爲所誤，而自胎伊戚。</p>
<p>（五）X光檢查爲診斷上必要之工具</p>
<p>凡百疾病，欲期有正確之治療，必須有正確之診斷，此一原則爲舉世所公認。病爲一種慢性結核病，暗中進行，患者每不自知，故尤須有正確之診斷，方能不失正確治療之時機，而收事半功倍之效，惟肺病欲得正確之診斷，非施行X光檢查不爲功。蓋肺病爲內臟結核病，非藉X光檢查，不能洞見癥結，而在潛伏期間，病勢未著，允非此無從揭發，故　病患者欲得正確之治療，必須認清X光檢查爲診斷上必要之工具，而及早受檢。</p>
<p>（六）早期診斷事半功倍</p>
<p>肺病發覺愈平，則痊愈亦速，蓋此時病毒尙未布及全身，祗須有正確之治療，無不達全治之目的。惟肺病初起，症狀極　，患者每不自知，此時僅有X光檢查，可得早期正確診斷，因早期診斷，而得早期治療，匪特　半功倍，節省醫藥，抑且因早復健康，而早事生產，無諭個人家庭，以至社會，胥蒙其利。</p>

Since March, the 800,000 citizens of Nanjing had been eagerly awaiting Chairman Chiang's early arrival in the capital, from which he had been absent for eight years. This desire became even more intense after the Chairman's initial inspection of Beiping the week before. The "Meiling" plane he was on left Beiping this afternoon and passed over Xuzhou at 2:35 PM.

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Over a hundred Chinese and foreign reporters participated in today's largest press conference in Chongqing to hear the Communist Party express its sincerity in ending the war against the government. Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army, said: "I am a soldier, and in the civil war, I have also been fighting. Now that I have come here, it shows that we no longer want to fight. Otherwise, we would not have come. The eyes of the world are focused on the question of war and peace within China. The Communist Party insists on adopting the second method." He also said: The most intense area of the civil war is in the triangular area of ​​Beijing-Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde. If the war in this area ends, then the cessation of war in other areas will be easier. We cannot achieve any solution through war. Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Communist Party, declared: The Communist Party is making every effort to promote the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. The conference should formulate a peace and construction plan based on a united government, starting with relief and restoration measures. Zhou said: The Communist Party agrees to establish a National Assembly to grant the country a democratic system. Under this democratic system, all parties and factions enjoy equal rights, and the military is nationalized. If the Political Consultative Conference fails to complete this task, then "we will continue to negotiate until we achieve our goal." Zhou also said: The Communist Party's proposal is flexible, and he mentioned various concessions in the past as factual evidence. Zhou said: General issues should be unanimously passed in the Political Consultative Conference, and detailed issues should be decided by a majority vote. He emphasized that the resolutions of the conference must be observed by everyone. Regarding the issue of military nationalization, Zhou said: The Kuomintang wants to first incorporate the Communist Party's army into the National Army, and then democratize the government, but the Communist Party advocates that democratization should be implemented first.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference Will Be Held Around Christmas</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Around Christmas, thirty-eight Chinese politicians, professors, scholars, bankers, and entrepreneurs will be able to hold the long-awaited Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing to discuss a peace plan for China's 450 million people. General Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of the conference without voting rights, is expected to return to Chongqing by the end of this week. Thirty-seven male representatives and one female representative representing the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and the Youth Party have now gathered in Chongqing. One non-partisan representative has not yet been appointed. This Political Consultative Conference has a wide scope and powers. It is intended to be an emergency, temporary peace united front, and it is the most important political round table conference in ten years. It is not yet known whether the meeting will be open to the public. The main topic of discussion will be how to fully cease fire so that restoration work can be promoted quickly. All parties have high hopes for the meeting. Although they recognize that the meeting may not be able to solve the complex political and military problems between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, they believe that the meeting can at least determine some broad and urgent measures related to the welfare of the people. The main issues to be discussed at the conference include convening a National Assembly of the constitutional drafting body, establishing a coalition government of all parties, unifying military command, and the organization of administrative agencies in various provinces, and the appointment of chief and deputy administrative officers.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the airport command room today. After a few hurried words, he and his wife boarded the plane and departed for the capital. According to Chairman Chiang, he was very pleased that President Truman reiterated the US policy towards China, stating that it has not changed. Now "President Truman's statement shows that he is very clear about the current situation in China. I mentioned the expansion of the foundation of the Chinese government in my speech on March 1, which is also one of the goals of the National Assembly." The National Assembly is scheduled to be convened on May 5 next year. The Chairman expects to meet US Special Envoy to China General Marshall in Nanjing or Hankou. According to information obtained here, Marshall will arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month. A reporter asked Chairman Chiang whether he felt that President Truman's statement implied that the United States expected the Chairman to make a fuller compromise with the Communist Party. After Madame Chiang translated, the Chairman replied: "What President Truman said in his statement is what I have advocated for the past three years. I hope that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can implement a peaceful and friendly solution." Due to time constraints, the Chairman did not express his views on the current situation in the Nine Eastern Provinces, the US reconstruction loan to China, and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. A reporter asked whether the hope of national unity had increased after the arrival of the CCP representatives in Chongqing. The Chairman replied: "I only received the news of their arrival yesterday, and I don't know what their attitude is. As for negotiating peace with the CCP militarily, it is what I want. The compromise between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party also depends on the CCP's attitude towards President Truman's declaration, and I don't know if the CCP can accept this declaration." According to the United States' insistence that China should not have an independent army, such as the CCP's Eighth Route Army, which is separate from the National Army, the Chairman's words probably refer to this. Chairman and Mrs. Chiang's visit to Beiping lasted exactly one week.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang's reception of reporters was rare, so it was no accident that the reporters were so honored today. This morning, we received a notice from the Ministry of Propaganda stating that a press conference would be held at noon. However, when we arrived at the designated location at 11:55, Madame Chiang came out to apologize to us, saying that the original plan had been changed and that they would go to the airport immediately, but would try to hold a reception there. Madame Chiang then left by car, and we also drove to the airport. The conference was finally held in the airport command room, and the reporters raised three important topics, to which the Chairman replied in the best diplomatic manner.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Government's Order to Conscientiously Comply with the Exemption of Land Tax in Recovered Areas <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] The National Government, considering that the people's burden has increased since the War of Resistance and that property has been lost, especially that of compatriots in the occupied areas who have suffered even greater oppression and pain, issued an explicit order on September 3 this year that all provinces and regions that have been occupied by the enemy should be exempt from land tax for one year. Other matters such as rent reduction and light interest are entrusted to governments at all levels and relevant authorities to convene meetings to discuss methods and implement them in order. However, according to recent reports, local governments still cannot avoid collecting supplementary taxes or borrowing taxes. In order to supervise and urge all provinces and cities to earnestly implement the tax exemption policy, so as to avoid acting against it in public but supporting it in private, the National Government yesterday ordered the Executive Yuan to quickly and strictly order all provinces and cities in the recovered areas to truthfully report on the handling situation.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco Radio Station broadcast on the 18th: The movement of Chinese troops to the Northeast has again encountered mysterious obstacles. It is said that from yesterday, the Chinese and Soviet authorities continued to discuss technical issues in Changchun. Du Yuming's troops have not advanced in the past ten days, and the rumor that Du Yuming's troops have crossed the Pan River is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco Radio Station broadcast on the 18th: A spokesman for the Chinese government declared: The Chinese side urgently needs to transport another 300,000 troops to the Northeast and another 200,000 police officers to North China. Currently, the US has airlifted four national army divisions to the Northeast and North China. The 92nd and 94th Divisions are in North China, and the 13th and 52nd Divisions are in the Northeast. There are currently as many as seven National Army divisions concentrated in Henan Province, preparing to go to the Northeast and North China.

According to Dong Yanping, who told reporters today: The weather has been severely cold in recent days, and the cold protection equipment in the barracks has not been fully arranged, so the date of the air transport of the group army cannot but be postponed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 17th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang's temporary headquarters announced today that the National Army has not yet entered Pan Yang, and the diplomatic and military arrangements have yet to be completed. As for where the National Army has gone, it is impossible to obtain accurate information.

<h3 id="e21">The United States Hopes that the Three Powers Can Reach an Understanding on Far Eastern Issues. The Foreign Ministers' Conference Has Entered the Formal Talk Stage. Stalin Returns to Beijing After Vacationing on the Black Sea Coast to Take Charge of Affairs <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Authoritative sources told United Press reporters today: The main expectation of the United States for the Moscow Conference is to reach an understanding on Far Eastern issues. President Truman has authorized Secretary of State Byrnes to reject any further Soviet demands on the control of Japan and insist that the Soviet Union must abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty. It is said that this attitude shows that the focus of American foreign policy has generally changed. The US State Department may place Far Eastern interests in the first place and put Europe in second place.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 18th] London generally believes that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference has included the Far East issue on the agenda. The fact that British Foreign Office Far East Director Bennett accompanied Foreign Secretary Bevin to the Soviet Union is a clear sign that they will discuss this issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] The progress of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is very confidential. Yesterday, the English and Russian broadcasts of the Moscow Radio Station did not comment on the conference. However, it is learned that after the three foreign ministers engaged in preliminary talks on the level of the issue on Sunday night, they have entered the stage of formal talks. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes summoned advisors and ambassadors early yesterday morning to discuss and study the latest instructions from their respective governments. Since the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was held, Soviet newspapers have published articles on atomic bombs, land trusteeship, and UN organizations from time to time.</p>
<p>Another telegram, the second meeting of the Moscow Conference, ended last night, lasting a total of two hours and twenty minutes. No communiqué was issued after the meeting, and all parties maintained strict silence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] Authoritative sources here said today that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has "made a good start". This morning, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes are both preparing for the third meeting this afternoon, and Bevin also intends to visit Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov before the meeting. All details about the agenda and discussion are still kept secret. Chairman Stalin has returned to Moscow after vacationing in Sochi on the Caucasus Black Sea coast. The announcement of this matter was welcomed by the Soviet people. Stalin's return to Beijing is to handle heavy official duties, and it is expected that the various rumors widely spread overseas will end with this announcement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 17th] After the first meeting yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Bevin revealed at a press conference that they had agreed to the suggestion made by US Secretary of State Byrnes to hold the next Foreign Ministers' Conference within three months. It is also learned that the United States hopes that the next Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held in Washington.</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Situation in Iran is Worsening, Making the Task of the Moscow Conference More Complicated. The United States Asserts that the Revolution in Northern Iran Did Not Occur Automatically <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin received a follow-up report on the Iranian incident yesterday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] According to authoritative sources close to the government, the US government has determined that the revolutionary movement in northern Iran did not occur automatically. However, the source did not want to comment on other matters.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] According to well-informed sources in London, the worsening situation in Iran will inevitably complicate the task of the Moscow Conference. The UN organization relies on the harmony of opinions between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. However, the three countries now have different attitudes towards the domestic situation in Iran, and behind the dispute between the Iranian government and the Azerbaijani autonomous elements, there is actually the entire issue of the great powers' security and strategic needs in the Middle East. The disturbed area is now expanding, failing to prevent disturbances from affecting the Kurdish people in Iraq and Turkey. Diplomatically, there are suggestions that the Iranian government can directly appeal to Britain and the United States for assistance. Judging from the rhetoric of the Soviet newspapers and the radio, the Soviet government wants to recognize this issue as part of the general situation in the Middle East and conduct a comprehensive discussion on the stationing of troops by the great powers in the Middle East region. Therefore, well-informed sources in London believe that the initial exchange of views at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is an attempt to agree on the limits of the discussion of the incident. The Foreign Ministers' Conference wants to base itself on mutual trust before starting major discussions and agree on the possibility of a common policy. It is obviously not easier to achieve due to the victory of the Azerbaijani autonomous elements in Tabriz. Officials said that the Moscow Conference is exploratory in nature, but in order to restore peace in the Middle East, the Foreign Ministers' Conference must have concrete agreements, which is quite obvious. Stalin's return to Moscow indicates that the three-nation talks are now gradually moving beyond the initial exchange of views.</p>
<p>British Newspaper Editorial Questions the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 18th] The Manchester Guardian commented today: If the British and American foreign ministers are wise, they should refuse to participate in the debate over whether Iran is democratic. Whether the Azerbaijani people's movement is an uprising of oppressed Turks and Kurds, or an automatic uprising of Iranian farmers and workers. Regardless of whether the accusations of various parties are true, without the support of the Soviet Union, the people's movement would never have expanded to its current extent, and the Iranian government would not have had to suppress it. What we should understand is the Soviet Union's intentions. If the Soviet Union only intends to improve Iran's local government, why not jointly exert pressure on the Iranian government with Britain and the United States? But if the Soviet Union intends to separate Azerbaijan from Iran before withdrawing its troops in March next year, then we have the right to ask the Soviet Union, how can it violate the treaty by taking this action, and at the same time, it intends to read its explanation of the purpose of this move.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Canadian Prime Minister Reports to Parliament on the Discussion of Atomic Energy, Preventing War Requires International Cooperation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Ottawa, 17th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King reported to Parliament today for the first time on the discussions on atomic energy by the United States, Britain, and Canada a month ago, stating: Organizing a world government, with each country handing over part of its national sovereignty, is the only solution to the various problems caused by the atomic bomb and the atomic age. It is a mistake to regard atomic energy as a dangerous new drug and want to control its use in commerce and peace. It is essential to manage the production, manufacture, and final distribution of atomic energy technically and scientifically, but it is obviously not enough. If we imagine that human peace and unity can be achieved with a commodity control plan, its foolishness is beyond description. Therefore, the final solution to the various problems caused by the atomic age can only be found in the philosophical scope. All countries also recognize that the mechanical solution to atomic energy, the agency that controls atomic energy, is at most a temporary expedient. Although the UN organization is the first step in establishing a world government, it is not enough to solve this problem. After all countries hand over part of their sovereignty, a new world government must be established, at least initially its powers are limited to preventing war and maintaining world security. The invention of the atomic bomb has opened our eyes and seen that if the UN organization cannot complete effective international cooperation, the world's future will encounter terrible developments.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 18th] Senior UN military staff officer Davis said: The anti-aircraft gunners of the Javanese independent army were trained by the Japanese army and shot accurately.

<p>[United Press Tokyo, 18th] At the preliminary hearing of Japanese war criminals this afternoon, the court will be requested to sentence Tsuchiya, formerly a guard at a prisoner-of-war camp, also known as "Little Glass Eyes," to death. Chief Prosecutor Major Jeffen stated that he could demonstrate that "Little Glass Eyes'" treatment of Allied prisoners of war was truly that of a "demon and sadist." Tsuchiya was brought into the gloomy Yokohama court for trial this afternoon, and questioning began immediately. Tsuchiya denied all the charges against him. Before the trial, the defendant's lead defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Dickinson, objected to one of the nine members of the military tribunal on the grounds of bias. This person was Colonel Bauer, who had been a prisoner of war of the Japanese army for three years after the fall of the Philippines. After investigation, Bauer admitted that he might be biased against the Japanese under certain circumstances. At 1:30 p.m. (Tokyo time), the defendant was escorted into the crowded courtroom by armed guards. The defendant, dressed in gray, appeared composed as he stood before the trial panel and listened to the indictment. The indictment was read simultaneously in English and Japanese, conveyed by a translator. He indicated that he understood all the charges. The defendant's lawyer tried to have two of the eight counts dismissed, but without success. The relevant clause of the indictment stated, "The defendant forced prisoners of war to line up and slap each other and arbitrarily disposed of Red Cross supplies." The defendant's personal translator, Australian Captain Clark, told American reporters that "Little Glass Eyes" was quite pleased with the execution of the trial and thanked those who defended him. The indictment stated that "Tsuchiya whipped a sick American prisoner of war to death with a thick rope. The victim who died from his injuries was named Gordon."</p>

<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 18th] Sources close to Prime Minister Shidehara said today that rumors that the cabinet had decided to resign on the 23rd of this month are unfounded. However, yesterday's cabinet meeting decided to dissolve the Japanese parliament after today's special session adjourns. Today is the 22nd day of the special session, and the rumors that the cabinet will resign on the 23rd may have originated from this. Representative Mitamura declared in the House committee that the Japanese government's various domestic reforms are being carried out under orders, without any independent initiative. Nakatani also criticized the Japanese government for often neglecting the Japanese parliament when implementing MacArthur's orders. The government replied that if the Japanese parliament had to approve MacArthur's orders in advance, the implementation of these orders would be slow. According to the government, the Shidehara cabinet will not resign before the general election in January of next year. Leaders of various political parties apparently want to do their best to maintain the precarious Shidehara cabinet through this year, pending the general election to be held in January of next year.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's special dispatch from Tokyo, 18th] The 89th Japanese Provisional Parliament, which opened on November 26, concluded today.

<p>The Japanese Imperial Household Ministry Recruits Imperial Guards</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 18th] According to Kyodo News Agency today, the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry has begun recruiting Imperial Guards from the Japanese countryside. The original Japanese Imperial Guards had seen an increasing number of resignations and departures due to the perceived "military atmosphere" within the Imperial Household, necessitating the recruitment of replacements. This unit, once purely a military organization, has now been transformed into a semi-political one. The newly recruited Imperial Guards must be between the ages of 17 and 19 and must undergo two years of training.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Three British scientists from Oxford are the first to manufacture artificial penicillin. They manufactured penicillin using chemicals instead of cultivated soil. The three are Sir Robinson, a 58-year-old professor of chemistry and president of the Royal Academy, who is currently in Paris receiving an honorary degree from the Sorbonne, Dr. Chain, a Nobel laureate, and Dr. Abraham, a biochemist who studied with Sir Robinson. The penicillin discovered in 1943, extracted from soil, is a mixture of four substances. To manufacture a penicillin molecule, it is necessary to quickly connect 14 atoms of carbon, 20 atoms of hydrogen, 4 atoms of oxygen, 2 atoms of nitrogen, and 1 atom of sulfur. Before Robinson and others began their research, only soil containing penicillin blue element could connect them, but Robinson and others finally discovered a chemical substance with the same bactericidal ability as penicillin blue element. These synthetic manufacturing methods have been repeatedly tested in the UK and the US and are continuing to be researched for mass production.</p>

<p>Township and Village Elementary Schools Appeal for Relief</p>
<p>The township and village-established elementary schools in Tangqiao West Dongjing and other townships in Songjiang County have been in operation for more than three months. The initial principle was to raise funds from the local area, but since the start of the school year, the township and village chiefs have made many excuses, and no funds have been raised to date. The principals of each school are worried about running out of funds and facing starvation, but because national education is a top priority for the future, they have not dared to shut down hastily. They have recently jointly submitted a request for relief to the county district office and hope that people who are concerned about public education and local education enthusiasts will quickly find ways to maintain the schools.</p>

<p>Troops Dispatched to Suppress Lake Bandits on Ma Ji Mountain</p>
<p>Ma Ji Mountain in Taihu Lake belongs to the jurisdiction of the Tenth District of Wujin County. In the past, it was occupied by treacherous bandits. After the enemy puppets surrendered, the bandits also withdrew to other places. However, the other day, a person claiming to be Zhang Zhendong, the district chief of Ma Shan, led his gang of forty or fifty bandits to the mountain to extort public grain from the households. Those who were late in paying were immediately flogged. The district chief Wu Pingzhai reported the matter and telegraphed the county government to dispatch troops to suppress the bandits. Yesterday afternoon, a platoon of soldiers from the Second Battalion of the County Security Force stationed in Xueyan Bridge, along with an eighty-man district defense team, crossed the lake by boat and launched an attack, advancing towards Peach Blossom Bay in the western part of Tan Shan, the bandit's stronghold. After two hours of fighting, they killed several bandits and captured one alive. Under the cover of night, the bandits boarded boats loaded with the collected grain and sailed away. It is reported that District Chief Wu has submitted a report to the county government on the incident and has requested that troops be stationed there permanently.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Konoe's Memoirs - Recounts Friction with Matsuoka Yosuke Before the Outbreak of the US-Japan War <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 18th] Konoe Fumimaro's memoirs, left behind after his suicide, state that before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States had proposed a plan to Japan that, if accepted, could have avoided war between Japan and the United States. Unfortunately, the Japanese reply was delayed for eight days. During those eight days, former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke probed the attitude of German officials towards the US-Japan negotiations. However, key figures in the Japanese army, navy, and political circles believed that the US proposal was sufficient to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict and should not be delayed. Matsuoka then sent the reply to the US authorities. Matsuoka was stubborn, self-willed and quick-tempered, and even suggested that the US and Japan conclude a neutrality treaty, but this was rejected by US Secretary of State Hull. After sending out the reply, Matsuoka received a response from Germany stating that they were willing to use the US-Japan negotiations to prevent the US from supplying materials to Britain, and encouraged Japan to threaten the US that if the US continued to supply Britain, Japan would join the war. Konoe's memoirs also state that as early as seven months before the Pearl Harbor incident, some people had argued that Japan must declare war on the United States. Matsuoka reported to the Emperor on June 8 that if Japan wanted to participate in the war, it must cooperate with Germany and Italy. Konoe consulted Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, on the issue of joining the war, asking him about the chances of success or failure. Yamamoto replied that if the war had a definite time limit, Japan could fight for half a year without problems, but if the war lasted for two or three years, he could not guarantee a victory. After hearing this, Konoe had a long talk with Matsuoka at the airport when he returned from Europe, but Matsuoka showed almost no interest in the US proposal. On the night of April 22, 1941, Matsuoka reported on his trip to Europe in a loud and harsh tone. When discussing the US proposal, Matsuoka expressed great excitement and pointed out that Germany fully trusted Japan based on the Tripartite Pact. The US proposal contained 70% malice and only 30% goodwill. Matsuoka delayed the reply to the US proposal, but he did not propose any modifications to the content of the proposal. The final modifications were approved by the cabinet on May 3, 1941, the second day after Matsuoka returned from Europe. The US proposal stipulated that Japan should not advance into the South Pacific, which would guarantee that neither the US nor Japan could establish a base in the South Pacific that would threaten the other country. However, Matsuoka opposed this and deleted it, adding a supplementary clause advocating that when the war between Britain and Germany reached the point where Germany was about to win, the US and Japan should mediate to end the European war. After the proposal was revised, the Japanese cabinet was eager to send the reply to the US government, but Matsuoka delayed it again.</p>
<p>Matsuoka notified Nomura, the Japanese ambassador to the US, instructing him to make a temporary reply to US Secretary of State Hull, suggesting the conclusion of a US-Japan neutrality treaty, pretending that this suggestion came from Nomura's personal opinion. Nomura sent the neutrality treaty proposal to Hull on July 5, but Hull did not consider it. Hull's attitude during this negotiation was unusually firm, which was rare for him, and he strongly stated that the US-Japan negotiations should be held as soon as possible. Matsuoka dispatched Sakamoto, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, to notify the German and Italian ambassadors to Japan that the Japanese government had indeed received secret proposals regarding the adjustment of diplomatic relations. When the German ambassador visited Matsuoka, Matsuoka asked German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for his opinion, saying that whether retaliating against US malice or resolving the China Incident, Germany would benefit in any case. At that time, Matsuoka also said to the Emperor that if the US participated in the war (the European war), Japan should join Germany and Italy. At this time, adjusting US-Japan relations would be futile. If Japan trusted Germany and Italy and still spent so much time discussing the US issue, he would resign. One of the amendments made by Japan to the US proposal, which deleted the clause guaranteeing no advance into the South, was delivered to Hull as late as November 15. Hull expressed great suspicion about this. After the final Japanese reply was sent, it received a note from Germany stating that the US was willing to compromise with Japan, the intention of which was to end the war against Germany, and the Japanese government should immediately state: (1) Japan believes that the US transporting convoys to supply Britain with materials is intentionally creating a war. (2) If the US stops this action, then Japan should consider the US proposal. The German government also hoped that Japan could notify Germany in advance when sending the final reply, so the friction between the cabinet and Matsuoka gradually increased. Even the Emperor Hirohito gradually lost trust in Matsuoka and even consulted on whether Matsuoka could be dismissed, but Matsuoka's stubborn attitude towards the US did not change as a result. Konoe's memoirs state: "Judging from Matsuoka's words and deeds, I suspect whether he made important promises to Germany during his stay in Germany. According to Matsuoka's report, Hitler and Ribbentrop both insisted that Japan should attack Singapore: Although Japanese leaders had hoped that the US-Japan negotiations would end in success, this hope ultimately proved illusory."</p>

<p>His Secretary Niuma Announced</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th, United Press] Konoe's secretary, Niuma, revealed that when Konoe resigned as Prime Minister in October 1941, he presented a memorial to the Emperor requesting the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China to avoid war with the United States. Konoe stated that Tojo opposed this proposal because it might affect the morale of the Japanese army. Tojo believed that if Japan yielded, the United States would become even more unrestrained and arrogant. Although the "China Incident" might be resolved temporarily, Sino-Japanese relations would inevitably break down within two or three years. Konoe's memorial to the Emperor stated that Tojo insisted that we must actively and quickly decide on the time to launch the war. He had four meetings with Tojo, but ultimately failed to persuade him to accept his opinion, so he felt unable to fulfill his important task of assisting His Majesty.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Lin Youlan</p>
<p>The trains from Guangzhou to Hong Kong are crowded, and black market tickets have appeared. Seats on flights from Chongqing to Hong Kong are fully booked until February of next year. People from mainland China are flocking to this prosperous island on the southern coast. I recently traveled to Hong Kong and found myself in a different atmosphere, far from my homeland. I have many observations. I will try to report to the readers of this newspaper what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>After three years and eight months of Japanese occupation, Hong Kong is no longer what it used to be. The main change is that the Japanese have eliminated most of the British atmosphere. The Queen's Statue Square on the Central waterfront, which was once used by the British military honor guard to welcome distinguished guests to Hong Kong, has had its surrounding bronze statues, including the one of Queen Victoria in the center, completely removed. The pair of bronze lions in front of the HSBC bank and the statues of the British monarchs have also become raw materials for factories in Osaka.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Artificial Beauty - Destroyed Almost Completely by Ezo <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese have destroyed almost all of Hong Kong's carefully constructed artificial beauty. The Japanese built defensive fortifications in Hong Kong's parks, cutting down flowers and trees, smashing chairs and railings. The former places of leisure have now become barren hills. The clocks in Gloucester Road, the Unified Wharf, and the Tsim Sha Tsui Wharf have all been damaged and cannot tell the time. In order to implement security measures, the Japanese have blocked many roads. The most obvious is the section connecting Connaught Road and Des Voeux Road on the coast of Sai Wan, which is dimly lit at night and looks like a ghost town. The street lights on the Peak, which used to look like strings of pearls, have disappeared.</p>
<p>The ugliness that the Japanese brought to Hong Kong is also very obvious. The Japanese removed the three flagpoles on the top of Victoria Peak, the highest mountain on Hong Kong Island, but built a so-called "Loyalty Pagoda" on Wan Chai Hill, where the fiercest fighting in Hong Kong occurred. Its clumsy form is visible from afar, making people unhappy. The Japanese rebuilt the Hong Kong Governor's Mansion, with its soaring pavilions and yellow tile roofs, which is very out of harmony with the nearby white high-rise buildings and green hills. The orange-yellow buses on Hong Kong Island, the green buses across the Kowloon Peninsula, and the shuttle-like gold-edged taxis have all disappeared. (Since October 1, the military government has returned a small number of remaining public buses painted dark gray to contractors. There are only six of these buses on the entire Kowloon Peninsula!) The alternative means of transportation are bicycles and tricycles. Imagine a well-dressed young woman sitting on the back of a bicycle, or two or three young gentlemen being transported across the street by tricycles like goods. What a sight!</p>
<h3 id="e50">General Prices - Four to Five Times Higher Than During the War <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, there were many things about Hong Kong that people missed, and its low cost of living was especially unforgettable. But today, general prices in Hong Kong are four to five times higher than during the war. For example, going to a teahouse in the morning, a plate of dim sum that cost five cents before the war now costs two to three dimes. A pound of beef that cost four dimes before the war now costs two dollars. Ordinary vegetables that cost five to eight cents per pound before the war now cost two to four dimes. Ordinary houses that rented for thirty dollars per month before the war now cost one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars. High-quality leather shoes that cost fifteen to twenty dollars a pair before the war cannot be bought for less than one hundred dollars now. Ordinary Western suits that cost thirty to forty dollars a set before the war now cost at least two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars. A newspaper that cost two cents to buy before the war now costs ten cents. Books published by the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company are sold at four times the list price instead of 90% of the list price before the war. In terms of transportation, the streetcar fare was three cents for third class and six cents for first class before the war, now it is eight cents for third class and one and a half dimes for first class. Public buses cost five cents for second class and one dime for first class before the war, now it costs two dimes for all classes. The ferry fare has not increased for first class, but the third class fare has increased from three cents before the war to five cents. The fare for a rickshaw was at least ten cents before the war, now it costs two dimes.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Government Administration: Implementing New Price Control Measures <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Among the various commodities, the price of firewood and rice have remained relatively stable. Rice is sold at five catties per dollar, and firewood at six dollars per load, both at the official price with no black market activity. This must be recognized as a unique advantage of the Hong Kong government's administration, and it deserves to be emphasized here, perhaps as a reference for our compatriots.</p>
<p>As I, the reporter, write this, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss the Hong Kong authorities' response to the current problem of the high cost of living. They are firmly grasping the principle of monetary contraction, instructing civil servants and employees of other commercial institutions to be paid according to pre-war standards. However, to cope with current needs, a living allowance of thirty dollars is added across all ranks. This is obviously still not enough to make ends meet, but the authorities believe this is a transitional phenomenon that everyone needs to understand and endure. This is because the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar has been fixed at one shilling and two pence per Hong Kong dollar. The main reason for the current high prices is that the supply system has not yet fully recovered. In the future, as transportation becomes smoother, markets recover, and goods flood in, prices will only fall and will certainly not rise. The British Shipping Authority has already redeployed a large number of ships to carry goods to the Far East, and ships have also been dispatched from India to carry coal and groceries to Hong Kong to help the authorities suppress the high tide of prices. I, the reporter, have interviewed merchants from various sectors all day, and they believe the above reasons are credible and that the suffering of the current high cost of living in Hong Kong is temporary. This statement may serve as an explanation for the continuous stream of mainland people moving to Hong Kong, but its accuracy remains to be proven by future events.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Fully Equipped: New First Army Passes Through Hong Kong En Route North <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>In addition to civilians, the continuous stream of people coming to Hong Kong also includes troops from our country's New First Army, passing through Hong Kong en route north. These well-equipped soldiers are stationed in camps that were previously converted from civilian houses by the Japanese army. The camps consist of small Western-style houses interspersed with trees, creating a beautiful scene, located in northern Kowloon Tong, opposite Hong Kong Island. There is an open space in the middle, separated from the civilian houses in the south. On the open space, the National Army has built a rostrum, flying the national flag, creating a magnificent sight. Below the open space, merchants have set up a temporary small market specifically for the National Army to purchase food and fuel. In front of the camp, there is a wide road (Waterloo Road) that leads directly to the city center. I, the reporter, went to visit yesterday morning, and on the way, I saw three battalions of the National Army passing through the city center after morning exercises, full of energy and marching in good order. Many wounded Japanese soldiers, supported by female nurses, looked down from the windows of a church (which had been converted into a wounded soldiers' hospital by the Japanese) by the roadside. I privately rejoiced at being able to witness this unusual scene, but I wonder what those three or five dwarves were thinking in their hearts!</p>
<p>The highest-ranking officer of the National Army coming to Hong Kong from Guangzhou, Division Commander Pan Yu-kun, is an old acquaintance of Major General Festing, the current Commander of the British Army in Hong Kong, from the battlefields of Burma. Hong Kong's overseas Chinese, upon seeing the majestic appearance of the National Army, were moved by their great contribution to the motherland and organized comfort activities. The Hong Kong and Kowloon District Three People's Principles Youth League launched a movement to entertain the National Army, and has obtained the consent of major cinemas, restaurants, and tea houses to provide free entertainment to the National Army.</p>

<p>The first batch of over a hundred National Army soldiers were led by the Youth League on the eighth to visit various places, enjoy tea and snacks at the Datong Restaurant, and watch a movie at the Entertainment Theatre before returning in high spirits. In addition, a musical concert was held to entertain the troops, and a shoe-shining fundraising campaign was launched. The Political Department of the New First Army also sent a Hong Kong and Macau Comfort Delegation to Hong Kong to convey the government's gratitude for the care of the overseas Chinese and to strengthen the overseas Chinese's understanding of the glorious victory. The connection between Hong Kong's overseas Chinese and the motherland has become even closer as a result. General Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of Guangdong Province, followed General Chen Ce, Mayor of Guangzhou, and came to Hong Kong on the tenth in response to the invitation of senior British military officers to visit Guangzhou. The cordial relationship between China and Britain has a very significant impact on today's Hong Kong. (Sent from Hong Kong Island on December 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Review of Prices for Yarn, Cotton, Flour, and Wheat <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shuxun</p>
<p>In recent days, commodity prices in this city have been on a downward trend, and the people's lives can gradually return to normal. However, after reading the recent economic news in various newspapers, I deeply feel that the prices of industrial manufactured goods in this city are still far from the prices of agricultural raw materials, which is not suitable. The reason for this is that some manufacturers seem unable to take a broad perspective. Here, I will discuss the prices of major commodities such as cotton yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat as follows.</p>
<p>Review of Major Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Last week (December 3rd to 8th), the price of 20-count miscellaneous yarn fluctuated around 400,000 yuan, while 16-count yarn was about 300,000 yuan. The raw cotton for 20-count yarn, fine Tongzhou cotton, was priced at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per dan, while the raw cotton for 16-count yarn, coarse Taicang cotton, was around 30,000 yuan. Assuming that one piece of 20-count cotton yarn requires three and a half dan of raw cotton, and each dan is priced at 40,000 yuan, the cost of raw cotton per piece is only 140,000 yuan. Adding processing costs of about 80,000 yuan, plus profit, the total cost of one piece of 20-count yarn should not exceed 200,000 yuan. However, in reality, the selling price is above 400,000 yuan. (At that time, newspapers reported that the highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn from the Shenxin Factory was 640,000 yuan, and the lowest was 480,000 yuan.) At the same time, the normal barter ratio on the market is about ten dan of raw cotton to one piece of cotton yarn. If the above facts are verified, then about six dan of raw cotton can be exchanged for one piece of cotton yarn (three and a half dan of raw materials plus two and a half dan of processing fees). Furthermore, we can also review the cost of yarn and cotton before the Pacific War and before the August 13th Incident to clarify the difference in the exchange rate between cotton yarn and raw materials (cotton) before and after the war.</p>
<p>Around May of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), this newspaper's economic column published an article by Long Ju-sheng titled "Hidden Worries About the Future of Yarn and Cloth," which stated (the price of American cotton, middling, for 20-count yarn was 82.9 yuan per dan, Indian cotton, white Lok, was 72.1 yuan, and Tongche cotton was about 89 yuan. Calculating that each piece of yarn requires 350 catties of cotton, the cost of cotton is 280 yuan. Adding processing fees of 40 yuan, some factories that spin 20-count yarn have processing fees of 40 to 50 yuan, including 20 yuan for manufacturing costs, 15 yuan for management and operating expenses, and 5 to 6 yuan for financial expenses. The total cost of each piece of yarn is 320 to 330 yuan, and it is currently sold for 380 to 390 yuan, so each piece of yarn can earn about 60 to 70 yuan...) This shows that in the 28th year of the Republic, the price of yarn was about 400 yuan, and the price of cotton was about 80 yuan, so five dan of cotton could be exchanged for one piece of cotton yarn. Going back even further, Jiang Diguang wrote an article titled "A Review of the Cotton Industry in the 24th Year of the Republic" in the third issue of the third volume of the "Social Economic Monthly," which provided a very detailed statistical analysis of the market prices of standard yarn and cotton that year. Here is an excerpt from the statistical table for December of the 24th year of the Republic:</p>
<p>Comparative Table of Standard Yarn and Cotton Market Prices for December of the 24th Year of the Republic (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Yarn Highest 202.00</p>
<p>Lowest 191.90</p>
<p>Average 196.90</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Highest 43.00</p>
<p>Lowest 40.45</p>
<p>Average 41.27</p>
<p>According to this table, it can be seen that before the August 13th Incident, one piece of cotton yarn could not even be exchanged for five dan of cotton. Therefore, the so-called barter trade in the current market, which averages five dan of cotton to exchange for one piece of cotton yarn before the war, means that one piece of cotton yarn is equivalent to the price of about five dan of raw cotton. Compared with the current market price of ten dan of cotton for one piece of yarn, it is exactly doubled. Is this reasonable? One cannot help but doubt it.</p>
<p>The Price Gap Should Not Be Too Wide</p>
<p>Although, manufacturers have their own difficulties, and the high cost of current expenses such as power, preparation, production, management, and interest payments is undeniable. However, we always hope that the foundation of the business should be considered from a broad perspective, prepared firmly, and the vision should be focused on the long term. This is a point that everyone must clearly recognize. This is no longer the era of enemy puppets occupying and exploiting us. This is an era of self-reliance, restoration, and regeneration. The price gap between raw materials and finished products should not be too wide, because (1) low raw material prices will affect their productivity, and we are not advocating a high-price raw material policy. We only want what is reasonable and conforms to the natural level of barter - although barter is temporary - (2) high finished product prices will weaken purchasing power in society. As for the price of flour, the main food in this city, last week it was around 2,500 yuan per bag (44 catties), but the price of the raw material wheat was only 2,500 yuan per 100 catties. The current market price standard for flour and wheat is also based on this ratio. Generally, we only know that 100 catties of wheat can produce about 70 catties of flour, with the remaining 30 to 40 catties of bran used for manufacturing and other expenses. Therefore, the trend of 44 catties of flour per bag being exchanged for the same price as 100 catties of raw wheat is unreasonable, similar to the situation with yarn and cotton mentioned above. (In recent days, flour mills have been bartering, exchanging 100 bags of flour for 100 dan of wheat.) Therefore, we must correct this kind of distorted price that violates natural principles and still exists on the road to victory and restoration; otherwise, we cannot consider it reasonable. I, the writer, solemnly propose that manufacturers pay special attention. When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is selling low-priced relief flour, it is also hoped that they will determine a reasonable selling price for flour based on the cost of domestic and foreign wheat and manufacturing expenses to lighten the burden on the people. In short, it is hoped that the prices of raw materials and finished products will be adjusted reasonably as soon as possible, and that we will focus on our business efforts!

<h3 id="e56">The Blood Debt of Nazism: The Hadamar Killing Factory <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch by United Press Correspondent Anderson</p>
<p>On the sixteenth, this newspaper published a shocking special dispatch from Nanjing, which described how the cruel and insidious Japanese army demonstrated their consistent brutality in a way that was simply outrageous. Now, we want to expose the crimes of European fascist Germany—the so-called ally of Japan—in the same way. If careful readers compare these two dispatches, they can at least understand that Germany and Japan are two brutal and inherently violent twin brothers in the world, and that the consequences, the utter defeat and destruction of all inhuman villains, are inevitable. The author of this article, Godfrey H. B. Anderson, is a United Press war correspondent who was captured by the German army in Africa and released by the US First Army. This article recounts the inside story of this Nazi killing factory, which is chilling to read. —Editor</p>
<p>A Mental Asylum: Terror Suffocates Hearts</p>
<p>I entered the Hadamar killing factory, just like the 40,000 people who came before me. But, I am not like those 40,000 people, because I walked out alive.</p>
<p>For the entire eighteen months from September 1943 to February 1945, I watched as those "patients" were sent into the Hadamar mental asylum, through those double wooden doors. They never appeared again, but new people kept coming.</p>
<p>I was a prisoner of war, confined in a nearby concentration camp with 300 American and Dominican officers. A few hundred yards away, on the opposite side of the valley, was the Hadamar mental asylum, a dark red-walled building painted with red crosses.</p>
<p>Every week, a train arrived in the valley, carrying old and weak men and women. Sometimes there were children. Doctors in white coats and nurses in white hats helped them up the hillside. The wooden doors opened to let them in, and they were never seen again.</p>
<p>We prisoners of war often joked: "There must be six people sleeping in one bed in there now," we always said that every time the train arrived.</p>
<p>One morning, a comrade saw a group of stretcher bearers walking up the mountain from the back of the mental asylum. They walked to the top of the mountain, where they placed a few planks of wood. Then they lifted the stretcher, and we saw something that looked like packages roll down. They removed the planks and hurriedly walked down the mountain.</p>
<p>Thereafter, every day at dawn, we peered out, and what we saw was always the same. Whether it was winter, summer, sunny, rainy, or snowy, those packages were always carried up the mountain and buried in the mass grave.</p>
<p>I talked to the German guards in the camp about this, and he said: "You don't have to worry about it. The Germans humanely killed them and notified their families. You don't have to worry because this is none of your business."</p>
<p>Later, seven months after the US First Army released me, which was a few weeks before this Hadamar case went to trial, I rode in a jeep, walked into that dark building, pushed open the door, and walked inside.</p>
<p>The Smoke of Human Flesh: Emitted from the Gas Chamber</p>
<p>"This is the gas chamber," the director said. It was a small brick room, with broken gas pipes still embedded in the walls. The original entrance had been bricked up, and the room had been cleaned very thoroughly, so there was no trace of the suffering and death of thousands of people here.</p>
<p>Next to the gas chamber was the morgue, which contained two marble tables with faucets, as well as several bottles of chemicals and some surgical instruments.</p>
<p>In addition, we saw some cellars, neatly piled with sweet potatoes. Finally, we arrived at the boiler room. Here, the corpses were cremated on a large scale, leaving no trace. Only two tall chimneys stood on top of the building, carrying the smoke of human flesh into the sky. We walked through the whitewashed corridors, along which were green doors. He opened them one by one with a key, and after I had seen them, he locked them all again. I saw the men's and women's wards, with whitewashed walls and yellow flowers on the wooden tables, very clean. Those patients were listless and seemed very comfortable, at least they were no longer afraid of anything.</p>
<p>But in one ward, a woman cried and banged her head against the door, and a nurse stopped her. From her, we saw an example of all the tragedies in France today. She was frightened into madness by the bombing, and all her children died. She just cried and raved deliriously: "Alas, acute neurasthenia," said the director.</p>
<p>We then walked towards the cellar, down those narrow stone steps. How many people had walked this road to death. When the black iron door opened, a terrifying cold air froze people's hearts and turned their stomachs.</p>
<p>As we walked along the winding road, the director told me his story. His name was Wilhelm Ahrwald, and he was a psychiatrist who had served in several Tibetan hospitals before the war.</p>
<p>40,000 Workers: Buried in Mass Graves</p>
<p>"I retired in 1941," he said, "I was very unhappy that the Nazi Party forced us to use mental patients for experiments. I was worried about these things and became ill, so they allowed me to retire. But in May of this year, the director of the Shanghai Hospital was transferred, and they called me back again. Now, I have to take care of 360 patients, and although I feel very heavy, at least I can do my best to take care of them."</p>
<p>He said that the order to destroy the patients was issued by the Ministry of the Interior in Berlin. A list was often sent with the names of the people to be destroyed circled. They told the doctors here that this was an order from Führer Hitler and that it was forbidden to leak it to the outside world.</p>
<p>But when notifying the families of the deceased, they only said "So-and-so died of illness."</p>
<p>After walking through a few more basements, we returned to the bright ground.</p>
<p>"At first, they used poison gas," said the director, "Then, they experimented with injections. The corpses were not necessarily cremated, sometimes fifteen or twenty were buried together on the top of the mountain. You can often see it."</p>
<p>A window opened, and a head stretched out. I said to him: I want to see the director here. The director was a hunchbacked old man with a bald head. His eyes flashed at me, as if he was a little scared. I asked to visit the hospital, and he said, "Of course!"</p>
<p>On the rows of graves on the top of the mountain, yellow flowers danced in the wind. Each corpse was marked with a number written on a wooden board after burial. The number has now reached around 500.</p>
<p>"There are of course many other people buried in these mass graves," said the director, "but no one knows how many. It is said that 40,000 German, Polish, and Russian workers are buried here, but there are no records and no traces. We are afraid that we will never know if it is true or false."</p>
<p>Next, we went to see the children's cemetery, where only one of the thirteen graves was marked with a name. It was a large wooden cross, and its shadow covered the murdered child.</p>
<p>Child Flees for Life: Chased and Kicked by Nazi Soldiers</p>
<p>I remember one day, I was looking at the hillside opposite from the prisoner of war camp and saw a child begging for his life. It was a summer evening. The child ran out of the red-walled hospital, like a wild animal hiding in an apple orchard. Three men followed behind him, holding guns in their hands, but they did not fire, they just chased him back and forth, as if they were playing hide-and-seek. In the end, the child was caught by them, dragged back, kicked and struggled.</p>
<p>Before leaving that gloomy valley, I went to see the former prisoner of war camp. I saw some American soldiers driving trucks, wandering around in those familiar rooms.</p>
<p>In front of the courtyard, empty wine bottles were piled into a small hill, the barbed wire had been pulled down, and the wooden sentry box was gone. A group of German children were using wooden fences to make bonfires. A child wearing a German military cap saw me walking by and shouted: "Hey, do you have any gum, mister?"</p>

<h3 id="e57">Kunming Students Should Resume Classes Quickly <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The student unrest in Kunming has persisted for over half a month. Chairman Chiang has already issued earnest instructions, the main culprit behind the grenade attack has been brought to justice, and the government's subsequent measures are generally appropriate. Moreover, Governor Lu of Yunnan Province is responsible for mediation, and elders from various circles and leaders of various organizations have repeatedly worked hard to make arrangements for the deceased and provide compensation to their families. It is agreed that the professors of the four schools, including the National Southwestern Associated University, Yunnan University, the English Specialist School, and the Sino-French University, who are highly respected by young students, have also tirelessly persuaded them to resume classes, and they even rang the bell on time the day before yesterday, with everyone going to their classrooms. Based on normal reasoning, the Kunming student unrest should be coming to an end, and after a long suspension of studies, we should be able to hear the sounds of learning again. Unexpectedly, news from Kunming yesterday stated that some students were attending classes in groups of three or five in the morning, but due to the orders of the strike committee in the afternoon, the classrooms were empty again. Furthermore, the professors of Yunnan University advised the students not to lose the sympathy of various parties. Additionally, social organizations in Yunnan Province sent a letter to the student unions of the four schools, stating that because they have repeatedly overturned agreements, they do not seem to represent the public opinion of all students, and therefore they are unwilling to negotiate further. Although the truth of the news from afar is unclear, the fact that Kunming students have not yet resumed classes raises the question of what they are still seeking, which is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>The initial reason for the Kunming students' strike was to "oppose the civil war." In reality, they should first study: What is the definition of "civil war"? What are its causes? What methods should be used to oppose it? Now, disregarding everything else, they directly use the vague slogan of "opposing civil war" as a call to strike, sacrificing their academic time in the process. Whether this is a wise move is already questionable. When the strike dispute led to student casualties, the government's panicked response created complications. Social sympathy and government concern led to the Chairman's instructions, the authorities' punishment of the perpetrators, the professors' persuasion, and the mediation of various sectors. This is all because everyone values education and cares for young people, and absolutely does not want to see these students sacrifice their studies for so long. The students of the four schools in Kunming are mostly close to adulthood, filled with enthusiasm and concern for national affairs. Their aspirations are commendable, and their feelings are understandable. However, if they only know how to stubbornly persist in the strike, using it as their only weapon, then let us ask: Now that the culprits have been punished, and the aftermath can be discussed, what more do the young students want, and why are they happy to waste their time? They must know that the most precious thing in the world is sympathy, and sympathy can be gained or lost, depending entirely on whether one's own behavior is reasonable. It is time for the Kunming students to pull back from the brink! In general, mass movements are often manipulated by a few individuals, who are either the public leaders or the behind-the-scenes strategists. The so-called masses unknowingly become tools for others to play with. Students are rational young people, and they should not willingly become tools. However, in the psychology of the masses, after being swayed by the loud cries of one or two people, they are often driven by emotion or coerced by power, rushing and chasing after each other without realizing it. At this point, reason has long lost its function. The fact that some Kunming students attended classes in the morning but went on strike again in the afternoon makes it easy to imagine the crux of the problem. More than half a month ago, there were rumors that the Kunming student unrest had a hidden agenda, with scheming strategists attempting to create a tragedy through the strike, expand the strike through the tragedy, and then use the strike to affect other sectors and spread to other places, turning the events in Yunnan into a spark that could start a prairie fire. However, looking at the overall situation, is it appropriate for China to have more disturbances at this time? Can we tolerate more sabotage? All problems can be discussed, but not with prejudice and treating each other as enemies. Even if we consider the original intention of the Kunming students, which is nothing more than opposing civil war, the representatives of the Communist Party have fortunately arrived in Chongqing after repeated calls, and the Political Consultative Conference will be opened soon. The government should also be open-minded in discussing and negotiating peacefully. As long as the Communist Party no longer resorts to force, the war can be stopped immediately, so why should students waste their studies? As for the aftermath of the student casualties, the government is determined to handle it properly, and all sectors are willing to negotiate, so the pillars of society will take responsibility, and they will definitely not disappoint the students. Even if the students do not trust the government, do they not trust the leaders of the social organizations and the professors of the schools? We sincerely hope that the Kunming students should resume classes quickly at this time. Only in this way can it be said to be a restoration of rational action, and not purely driven by emotion.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, Kunming was a place where universities and colleges gathered in the rear, and a love of freedom was the nature of general young students. The influence of professors and the advocacy of scholars have made Kunming a political center and a focus of factional disputes in recent years. As a result of these激盪, unfortunately, there was a student unrest. Therefore, although the student unrest is a matter for the students, the government and society should bear the responsibility for creating this student unrest, and the young students are actually innocent. However, students cannot rely on their youth to invite the forgiveness of others, and then disregard everything and not ask about the truth, and strike to the end. Since it is called a school, it must teach; since it is called a student, it must attend classes. There is absolutely no school in the world that will be suspended for a long time, and there are no students who will strike permanently. The time for Kunming students to resume classes is now, and it cannot be delayed any longer. The Yunnan University professors said in their letter of advice that they should not allow the foundation of the school to be shaken, and their words are serious and sincere. We deeply hope that the young students will think carefully about it!</p>

<h3 id="e58">Returning to Calm After the Brilliance - Gold and Banknotes Stabilize - Public Bonds Slightly Decline, Foreign Stocks Sell Well <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was calm, with all parties watching and waiting. Trading was limited, and fluctuations were minimal. After opening in the morning, prices hovered around the previous day's closing price. At noon, the market closed slightly higher. It briefly dropped to around 720,000, but was supported by some bargain hunters. In the afternoon, both overnight and spot transactions were very stable. As a result, the market closed slightly lower than the previous day, down 11,000. Gold jewelry was listed at 78,000, and silver remained unchanged at 600 yuan. Silver dollars also remained stable between 440 and 445. Interest rates remained loose, around 6 to 8 cents. The general sentiment is that the current prices of gold and US dollars will not deviate too much from the official exchange rate. After the exchange rate is announced, the market will be even more stagnant. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer active players, and they are shifting their targets. As a result, the trend is not changing much.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, US dollars, also showed sluggishness, initially flat and then weak. In this environment, all parties were unenthusiastic, and there were more closings. In the end, it fell 15 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also followed the general trend, continuing to be oversupplied. As a result, old goods fell 10 yuan, and new goods fell 4 yuan. Australian pounds hovered around US$2.5 and Rupees 2.5.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of public bonds gradually reached a balance. Outsiders and cotton yarn merchants were interested, but securities firms and Hakka merchants took profits and left. Since the industry insiders have already closed out their positions, the market gradually shifted from brilliance to flatness. There was a lack of momentum for price increases, and the market was firm but then weakened. Class C bonds broke into the 700 yuan range from a high of 760 yuan. At the close, due to time constraints, Classes A, B, C, D, and E all declined slightly.</p>
<p>Due to the addition of new buyers, Chinese stocks continued to be popular on the market. However, because large players related to the United States and Asia took profits at high prices, buying interest was dampened. Industry insiders saw that the situation was not good, and they closed their positions. As a result, market prices did not advance and retreated. The price of US Asia declined from a high of 430 yuan, and yarn factories declined from 580 yuan. Retail investors on the market also followed suit and sold aggressively. Various small stocks, such as Xinguang from 36.5 yuan, Jingfu 31.5 yuan, and Qinxing 26.5 yuan, gradually became one-sided. In the middle of the session, funds from the bond market entered, and there was a slight recovery, but at the close, they still succumbed to the selling pressure. As a result, large stocks fell about 10 yuan, while small stocks were flat.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be popular due to absorption by securities firms. The base price was very cheap, and holders were unwilling to sell easily. The trend continued to be popular. The issue of transfer was still the focus of discussion, but it has not been confirmed by the relevant parties. Because the trend was favorable to buyers, sellers hoarded goods and raised prices. As a result, the market showed a buying price. Compared with the previous close, Yisha rose 170 yuan, beer rose 110 yuan, paper rose 40 yuan, and other cereals rose about 10%. However, at noon, due to the sluggish market prices of various industries, the receiving price was slightly lower, and there was gradually a supply of goods.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Grain Prices Rise - Rice, Flour, and Oil All Increase <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Rice shipments were scarce, and the market was firm. White japonica and indica rice both increased by 300 to 400 yuan. White yuan rice was no match for sales, and rose another 500 yuan, and liquidation was active. Flour from the Gang and Yong gangs was still exportable, but the local market was still weak. Prices rose by more than 300 yuan, and the situation was high and sluggish. The oil market was tight, up 500 to 600 yuan. Soybean shipments were balanced, and the market was stable. Raw peanuts continued to increase and were then killed, and bean cakes were flat.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Yarn and Thread Supply and Demand in Balance <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained firm. Customer sales were still active. Local merchants were very active in buying and selling 16-count yarn. A certain cloth factory had a slight interest in 32-count fine yarn. The price of each count of yarn and thread was similar to the previous day. Because the supply and demand of spot goods is temporarily in a state of balance, the price of yarn and thread was stable for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Cotton Textile Completion of Tax Payment - Application to Improve Methods <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Commodity Tax Bureau, the completion of tax payment certificates for cotton yarn directly woven into finished products has been limited to packaging (10 pieces per package). However, dyeing and weaving factories and cloth shops in this city all need to transport goods in bulk. Therefore, the bureau has been requested to improve the regulations on the completion of tax payment certificates for the convenience of merchants and civilians.</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) As of now, the Shanghai Banking Association Organizing Committee has registered 76 old members who have obtained licenses from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has approved the establishment of four banks: Overseas Chinese, East Asia, Guangdong, and Central. As for foreign banks that have resumed business, they are also in the process of registering as members.</p>
<p>Also, all commercial banks in this city have decided to close for one day on the 20th of this month to settle interest for all depositors in the second half of the year. Also, the 25th is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and will also be a holiday.</p>

<p>White coal dealers are still keen to import, and market prices continue to rise. Although bituminous coal is stable at the original price, sales seem to be stronger than before. However, shipments of firewood and charcoal from various sources have increased sharply, and the trend is weakening.</p>
<p>The American Liberty ship "Blue Star" arrived here from Taiwan yesterday morning, carrying 9,000 tons of coal. Another Liberty ship, "Max Steilai," which went to Qinhuangdao, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 8,600 tons of coal.</p>

<p>Since the resumption of foreign trade, three or four tung oil dealers have jointly sold 600 barrels to foreign firms, which were shipped out the day before yesterday. It is heard that another 150 tons have been sold recently, with the price calculated at 31,000 yuan per market dan in legal tender. The foreign exchange is settled by the foreign firm and has nothing to do with the seller. However, most of the oil arriving from eastern Zhejiang is not of sufficient quality. It is difficult to select oil for export, and it can only be sold cheaply for domestic sales at a price of 22,000 yuan per market dan. However, small vendors have disappeared recently, and there are no wholesale purchases in the market.</p>

<p>Commodities have risen due to rumors of adjustments to commodity taxes.</p>
<p>Transactions of raw silk have become more active, and most of the goods are sold to local merchants. Market prices are unchanged.</p>
<p>The prices of raw starch and dried scallops have risen. Persimmon cakes are only used to make "opening stage cakes", and there are few shipments of Geng cakes.</p>
<p>Cigarettes continued to rise in the morning, but profits were taken in the afternoon, and there was a slight pullback. However, compared to the previous close, Yizhong cigarettes were all adjusted upwards.</p>

<p>Since the opening of navigation between Shanghai and Fujian, there has been congestion in Shanghai. It is learned that another two iron barges, Yipuji 155, carrying more than 5,000 bags of flour, more than 300 pieces of cotton, and a total of more than 1,000 tons of miscellaneous goods, are scheduled to be towed to Quanzhou by the Tianxing Wheel tomorrow, and are currently being loaded.</p>
<p>The Chinese Farmers Bank, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, is actively restoring farmers' loan business and has now drafted regulations, which have been submitted to the head office for approval.</p>
<p>According to rice merchants, the first batch of Siamese rice will arrive in Shanghai within two months, and the quantity is very large, estimated at 4,000 yuan per stone in legal tender.</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) After imported goods are taxed according to regulations, they can be transferred to various places, whether in whole or in part. According to regulations, they only need to submit the receipt for verification, and they can be released without hindrance. However, from June 1938 to September 12 of this year, all import duty receipts issued by customs in the occupied areas are invalid. If the goods need to be transferred, they must still pay taxes according to the current tax regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Enemy and Puppet Purchases of Yarn and Cloth - Dyeing, Weaving, and Yarn Industries - Request Compensation for Damages - Remaining Yarn and Cloth Returned Proportionally <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, and Yarn Industry Associations stated that in August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the enemy and puppet authorities ordered the puppet merchants' association and the cotton association to purchase yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area. The control was strict, and no yarn or cloth was left. According to statistics, 61,058 pieces of cotton yarn, 1,079,807 pieces of white cloth, and 4,072,296 pieces of processed cloth were forcibly purchased. Although the price was slightly given at the time, it was actually equivalent to seizure, because it was less than half of the market price at the time. Therefore, merchants suffered heavy losses. Moreover, after the purchase, new production and trade in cotton yarn and cloth were not allowed, and all factories and shops in the city were shut down. Today, after the victory, most of them cannot resume business due to lack of funds. At the beginning of the victory, the heads of the industry associations jointly requested the authorities to order Japan to compensate for the losses. They requested the return of the remaining yarn and cloth that had not been transported by the puppet cotton association, including 13,226 bales of cotton yarn, 146,912 pieces of white cloth, and 2,126,639 pieces of processed cloth, proportionally to the merchants who were forced to sell. In the meantime, in addition to being summoned by the municipal government to instruct representatives to request the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration, there was no effective way. Yesterday, when the central representatives Ye and Niu were in Shanghai, they submitted separate petitions for relief in order to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Unified Bonds Exceed Face Value <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jun</p>
<p>Recently, unified bonds have been rising steadily, breaking through the 700 mark. The reason is that although it is caused by speculators manipulating and monopolizing, many financial and banking circles have absorbed a lot. According to people from the interior: "Since the National Government moved west, the interest on unified bonds has been suspended since the 31st year of the Republic of China. Although the lottery is still held, the winners have not been repaid. Due to this point, people speculate that the government has the hope of rewarding public bonds.</p>
<p>Also, after the First World War, the German Mark depreciated, but the public bonds issued by the German government were repaid in Gold Marks. At that time, Germany was the defeated party, and they still did so. How much more should our victorious country do so today? From the lessons of the past, the current prosperous situation of public bonds is also expected.</p>
<p>According to the repayment of principal and interest of public bonds, there is a certain amount, which is different from stocks and goods. Occasionally, due to supply and demand, there may be cases where the face value is exceeded, but the number is very small, and there is no huge amount of excess. During the occupation period, the issuance of counterfeit currency was excessive, and there was no credit, so that the market price of public bonds exceeded the face value greatly. This is the difference in currency value, and it is not surprising. After the victory, the principal and interest of public bonds and the daily market price are both valued in legal tender. However, yesterday's market price, Unified A was the smallest, and the closing price was still 380 yuan, and Unified C even reached 700 yuan. Although it is said that people's hearts are with the Han, it is still an inconceivable thing from the perspective of economic normality. Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Zhao, explaining why the face value was exceeded so much, which should be the common psychology of general consignees, so it is specifically printed as above.

<h3 id="e70">Taiwan's Current Three Needs - The First Need is the Nourishment of the Motherland's Ideology - The Second Need is to Endure Great Hardship and Great Effort - The Third Need is to Correct Japanese-Style Chinese <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Taipei, 17th] A reporter who visited various places in Taiwan for more than 20 days last month wants to specifically mention to the people of the country today that what Taiwan needs most at present are first-class thinkers, educators, philosophers, and scholars.</p>
<p>Try to Suppress</p>
<p>In the past, the Japanese education policy in Taiwan only allowed Taiwanese to develop in medicine and technology, while trying to suppress them in ideology and academics. Therefore, today, these two types of talents have become deformed. If Taiwan's specialists and technical talents can be nourished by ideology and imbued with lofty ideals, they will not only be first-class experts, but also pillars of national construction. If the authorities of the first-class academic circles in the Mainland can organize a Taiwan visiting group at this time to give public lectures and systematic introductions of the motherland's academics over the past 50 years, it will be of great benefit to the education of the Taiwanese people. Secondly, Taiwan currently needs to endure great hardship and great effort. Taiwan has rich resources, but the development of resources cannot make Taiwan the ideal prosperous place without hard work.</p>
<p>Serious Situation</p>
<p>Taiwan has always been known as Japan's warehouse, but at present, there is a serious food problem everywhere, and even sugar production has a problem. The reason is that in addition to the lack of fertilizer sources, Taiwan itself has too much rainfall, the sugarcane planting period is long, and the cost is high, which cannot compete with foreign sugar. It is also a big problem. In the past, the reason why Japan used the power of the state to cultivate Taiwan sugar and prevent foreign sugar from invading the Taiwan sugar market was that Japan did not have sugar in its homeland. Secondly, the reporter wants to mention the writing. The text currently used by the Taiwanese people is mostly Japanese-style Chinese, which is in contrast to the "etc. because of" and "follow this" used by the authorities.</p>
<p>Difficult to Read</p>
<p>The reporter once read a letter from a sugar expert to a senior official, and his opinions on the current contribution of Taiwan were indeed unique, but his Japanese-style Chinese was really difficult to read. There are many Taiwanese who are engaged in the work of teachers. When they perform their duties in the future, they will also feel uncomfortable with the use of official documents and Chinese sentences.</p>
<h3 id="e71">First Batch of Poor Students - Subsidies Issued <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Private Elementary Schools Will Issue in 10 Days</p>
<p>Private Secondary Schools Will Collect on the 21st</p>
<p>[Report from this city] The Municipal Education Bureau has raised a large sum of money for poor students in private elementary schools in this city to subsidize part of their tuition fees. The news has been reported in previous reports. The subsidy method has been approved by the 11th Bureau Affairs Meeting. The number of subsidies for each school is 5% of the total number of students in the urban area and 10% in the rural area, and 1,000 yuan in legal tender for each student. All private elementary schools that have been registered and approved for review can receive subsidies. However, the review is quite complicated and requires an inspection report. If the results of the investigation are satisfactory, the National Education Department will notify the schools in batches by letter to collect the subsidies. Schools that are not very satisfied with the review will be given a grace period, and those whose establishment is revoked or ordered to be suspended will not be able to receive subsidies. Also, in order to speed up the issuance, schools can receive the money first after receiving the notification, and must issue it within 10 days. Then, they must submit the official receipts of each student's parents for the bureau to review. It is heard that the first batch of notification letters has been issued, totaling 93 schools. The remaining schools can wait until they receive the notification before collecting the subsidies.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is heard that the subsidy for poor students in private secondary schools has been decided that the principal must bring the school seal and the principal's personal seal to the Education Bureau on the 21st of this month to collect the subsidies.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Teachers' Salaries in Nanjing <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Minimum Monthly Salary is More Than 17,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency Nanjing] After the municipal government decided to increase the salaries of teachers in primary and secondary schools in Nanjing, the Social Bureau immediately followed up to ensure that teachers could work with peace of mind. Only the salary standards, in addition to the rice allowance that had been determined earlier, the rest, such as the base salary increase and the living allowance, had to be discussed in detail, so the salaries for October could not be issued on time. Now, all the standards have been determined, so all the salaries for October have been reissued. The base salary has been increased by 40 times, the living allowance is 5,000 yuan, and the rice allowance is 3,000 yuan. Assuming that the lowest salary is 50 yuan, according to the above combined calculation, you can get 10,500 yuan. Starting from November, a part of the new standard will be issued first, with the base salary increased to 60 times, the subsidy to 7,000 yuan, and the rice allowance to 6,500 yuan. Therefore, the lowest salary of 60 yuan can get 17,160 yuan per month.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing] Many middle school students participated in wartime work. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, they will all return to their original schools.

<h3 id="e77">Charity Basketball Game for Scholarship Funds; Successfully Concluded Last Night; Hua Lian Defeats U.S. Navy Youths; China Youth Team Exhausted and Loses to Guangdong-Western Team; Great Philanthropist Zhang Zhihong Purchases Charity Ball <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-American charity basketball game for scholarship funds, jointly sponsored by this newspaper and Tongde Medical College, was the last two games last night. The program was quite exciting. Fans braved the cold wind to come, and their enthusiasm for helping students is admirable. This newspaper and Tongde Medical College expressed their infinite gratitude to the players for their wonderful performances and the fans for their enthusiastic participation.</p>
<p>Auction of Charity Ball</p>
<p>During halftime of the second game, Mr. Pan Gongzhan presided over the auction of the charity ball, starting at 10,000 yuan. The philanthropists competed to buy it, and the price soared. In a moment, it increased to 80,000 to 90,000, and finally, the great philanthropist Zhang Zhihong bought it for 100,000 yuan. Then, Mr. Pan gave award flags to each participating team.</p>
<p>No Winner</p>
<p>Hua Lian and the U.S. Navy Youths first confronted each other. Referees Jin Botao and Chen Baolin, the U.S. Navy Youths, Xia Mashiyue, Jie Kasiqi, and Hu Zixian scored successively, taking a 4-0 lead. Hua Lian did not panic. Wu Chengzhang, Chen Xuechong, and Li Zhenzhong showed their might, exceeding the U.S. Navy Youths 4-4 in a moment. The U.S. Navy Youths were at a loss. At this time, Hua Lian suddenly changed its lineup. Zhang Liangxiong and Chen Zuoliang came on the field one after another, replacing Kong Guangyi and Li Zhenzhong. The defensive structure loosened, and the U.S. Navy Youths took this opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. Hua Lian seemed out of sync. The first half ended in a 23-23 tie.</p>
<p>Confident</p>
<p>In the second half, Hua Lian reused its most standard lineup. However, the momentum of the U.S. Navy Youths had grown, so the scores rose and fell. 25-27, 29-31, four times equalized. At the height of tension, in fact, Hua Lian had a higher skill, and Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, and Bo Tuo took the opportunity to become active, and the scores led gradually. When Hua Lian took the lead with 47-43, Hu Zixian of the U.S. Navy Youths graduated with four fouls, and Aikinsen's appearance had a desperate momentum, forcing a 47-47 tie again. The audience was worried for Hua Lian. The Hua Lian soldiers were confident. Li Zhenzhong showed his power again, scoring three goals in an instant, and finally won the U.S. Navy Youths 55-47.</p>
<p>Steady and Solid</p>
<p>In the second game, China Youth faced Ausina. Referees Qu Honglv and Chen Liang, who had not been seen for a long time, teamed up. The battle began in the opening ball ceremony presided over by Director Gu Yuxiu of the Education Bureau. China Youth used a slow offensive strategy, and Lin Weicong opened the scoring, adding another goal, taking a 4-0 lead. The Ausina team immediately showed its power. Lin Weicong was really good, one throw and one penalty, Xu Meng scored one goal, and China Youth still took the lead with 7-4. Xu Meng of the Ausina team scored again, and the scores gradually caught up. After 7-7, it was exceeded. China Youth proceeded carefully, refusing to relax, and controlled it with a steady and solid method. The Ausina team's Wheeler and Xu Meng were sure to score, causing China Youth to be unable to raise their heads, only trying to follow. In the first half, the Ausina team won with 22-17, and China Youth was only 5 points behind.</p>
<p>Main Player Absent</p>
<p>The game continued after the award ceremony. Ausina became more and more brave. Boba Xu Meng's one-handed basket exploration was unpredictable, taking the lead with 31-19 in an instant. China Youth replaced Liu Fushan with Yao Wenyi, intending to find a way to the basket, but the opponent's defense was very strict, and there was still no progress. On the contrary, the Ausina team's momentum was strong, rushing left and right, invincible. China Youth's attempt to advance quickly was chaotic, so it could not get close. Until the bell rang, Ausina won China Youth with 41-29. China Youth lost its leading role last night due to the absence of the main player Ma Canxi, resulting in a scattered sand-like game, which is a pity.</p>

<h3 id="e79">High Court Joint Collegiate Bench; Tries the Traitor Chen Riping; Final Arguments Concluded, Sentencing on the 22nd <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai High Court specially formed a joint collegiate bench at the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday to try the traitor Chen Riping. The presiding judges included Chief Judge Liu Gui, Prosecutor Lin Woming, Judge Zhu Zonghai, Judge Cao Jun, and Secretary Wang Lanping. Prosecutor Lin first announced the main points of the indictment: Chen, a traitor, served as a "Legislative Member" in the puppet organization in May of the 27th year of the Republic of China, and in December of the same year, he served as "Director of the National Treasury" and "Permanent Vice Minister of Finance." In May of the 28th year, he served as a supervisor of the "Huaxing Bank," in August of the 32nd year, he served as "Director of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government," in May of the 33rd year, he served as a "Consulting Committee Member of Shanghai," and in October of the same year, he served as the former "Deputy President of the News." Chen has served in puppet positions for many years, and his bad deeds are obvious. After clear investigation, he is indicted in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors for plotting against the country for the enemy's sake. It is hoped that your court will severely punish him according to law.</p>
<p>Inside the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, the High Court's joint collegiate bench publicly tried the traitor Chen Riping yesterday. The lawyers defending the defendant were Qian, Zhang, and Zhao. Except for Zhao, Qian and Zhang arrived in court on time. The one standing in the picture wearing a long coat with his hands clasped is Chen, confessing everything before the presiding judge. The one sitting behind wearing a robe is one of the defense lawyers.</p>
<p>Defendant Confesses to Serving in Puppet Positions</p>
<p>Then, Chen Riping stated the process of serving in puppet positions and being arrested, saying that he was tempted by the Japanese man Ōta Shigeru in the 27th year of the Republic of China. In May of the same year, Shanghai's tabloids suddenly published that the defendant was appointed as a "Legislative Member." Because the environment at that time was harsh, it became true by mistake, and he embarked on the wrong path. Although he served in many puppet positions, he did not collude with the enemy to betray the country, oppress, or defraud. Especially when he served as "Deputy President of the News," he tried his best to promote social welfare undertakings and relief undertakings. As for all expenses, not a penny went into his own pocket. If it can be discovered in the various puppet positions that the defendant did indeed harm the country and oppress the people, he is willing to be executed by shooting.</p>
<p>The Court Interrogates the Arrest Process</p>
<p>The court inquired about the process of his arrest. According to his answer: the defendant lived in Room 57, No. 37 Huanlong Road. On September 15 of this year, because the Englishman wanted to take back the house for his own use, he moved into No. 54 of the same house through the introduction of a Portuguese foreigner. How could he know that the house was occupied by a Korean who had served as an enemy intelligence officer, who suddenly came back. When the defendant was talking to this person, the military police came to arrest the Korean, and the defendant was arrested along with him. Finally, Chen requested the presiding judge to return the residence and unseal the property to maintain the lives of his wife and daughters. Chief Judge Liu asked about the puppet positions, and Chen answered them one by one. The court then presented Chen's pro-enemy thesis on the "Greater East Asia" war, and the medals awarded by the puppet government. Chen was evasive and reluctant to answer.</p>
<p>Serious Crime Suspected, Punishment According to Law</p>
<p>Afterwards, the presiding judge announced the start of the debate. Prosecutor Lin immediately stood up and said that Chen had received advanced education and willingly allowed himself to be used by the enemy. The evidence is conclusive, and when he served as the "Deputy President of the News," he specialized in propaganda for the enemy. According to the crime in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, there is no room for sophistry. From the 27th year to the present, the suspicion of being attached to the enemy is very serious. The so-called promotion of welfare undertakings is not enough to reduce the crime he should be punished for, and he should be punished according to law.</p>
<p>Grew Up in Japan, Shallow Understanding</p>
<p>Then, the defendant's lawyer Qian Naiwen stood up to defend, saying that the defendant had been influenced by Japanese education since childhood, and his understanding of the motherland was inevitably shallow. The responsibility lies in the failure of our country's education of overseas Chinese in the past few decades. Moreover, Western European countries often have foreigners born in the country who should accept the obligations of the country of birth. In wartime, the country can only be regarded as the enemy, not as a traitor. Furthermore, the defendant's motive for serving in a puppet position was due to coercion. In addition, the defendant did not commit corruption or pervert the law when he served in the puppet position, and he was very enthusiastic about promoting social welfare undertakings. According to the last clause of Article 3 of the Punishment Regulations, he requested leniency. Lawyer Zhang Yuji also stood up to defend. Finally, Chief Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter obtained reliable information yesterday that the major traitors currently detained in various special detention centers have been successively escorted to the Tilanqiao temporary detention center. From this, we can know that the small traitors will soon be followed by public trials one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Foreign Merchants Handling Property Rights Procedures; The Municipal Government Orders a Stop <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>In the past, due to the concession relationship in this city, foreign merchants and expatriates purchased or leased land from Chinese people. In addition to the permanent lease or deed issued by the Chinese government, they also registered with the consulates of the respective countries. The purpose of this registration procedure was to collect property taxes from the expatriate merchants of the respective countries, that is, the land donations that were called in the past. The Chinese government, subject to treaty relations, no longer collected land taxes or other land donations from foreign merchants and expatriates. Therefore, unscrupulous people competed to transfer land to foreigners, with foreigners attached to the document as proof of the transfer of property rights. After the land was sold, it was not transferred or collected by the Chinese government to evade taxes. Some foreign merchants specialized in buying and selling land, so there were abnormal phenomena such as "registration," "large transfer," and "small transfer," which actually infringed upon China's sovereignty. Now that the concessions have been recovered, they will be corrected. The municipal government has formulated and promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau to Handle Permanent Lease or Deed Land Registration." The Municipal Land Administration Bureau recently found that 14 foreign merchants, including Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., did not understand China's laws and published in newspapers the re-handling of property rights procedures, which hindered the land consolidation plan. Yesterday, it reported to the municipal government to transfer the order to stop. It is reported that the municipal government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer the order to each foreign firm to stop this kind of business, and to send a letter to the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shanghai to investigate and verify in order to maintain national rights.</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) Sha Li, the former Commissioner of the Police Department of the French Concession, who specialized in providing intelligence to the enemy and assisting in the arrest of our patriotic elements during the enemy-puppet occupation period, was arrested at his residence by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters five days ago.

He was escorted by prison car to the Procuratorate of the High Court in Tilanqiao at 5:00 PM yesterday, and will soon be publicly tried. Sha Li is quite burly.

<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppets forcibly acquired factories. Regarding the handling principle of this property right, the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee has passed it and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. All factories sold to the enemy during the war, if the owner can provide</p>
<p>Conclusive Evidence</p>
<p>Proving that the selling price was less than 50% of the market price of the factory building and machinery at that time can be regarded as strong evidence of forced sale. The Review Committee or the Handling Bureau, after finding out the details and whether the original owner colluded with the enemy and puppets, may draft measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Those with the lightest circumstances may request the original owner to have the highest priority of purchase based on the assessed price. Also, the handling</p>
<p>Small Shops</p>
<p>The principle has also been decided by the Review Committee, please have the Shanghai Municipal Government issue a return to the original owner, bid for auction, or municipal office according to the nature of the store. (1) If the house is occupied or rented by the enemy and puppet, and its business is not suitable for continued operation, it will be returned to the original owner depending on the situation. (2) If the house is owned by the enemy and puppet, and its business is not suitable for continued operation, together with the production and commodities, the Central Trust Bureau will bid or auction them separately, and the proceeds will be submitted to the special account established by the Handling Bureau in the Zhongxing Bank. (3) If the house is rented and has not expired, and the business is still suitable for operation, the production and commodities in it should be bid or auctioned separately by the Central Trust Bureau, and the proceeds will be handled in accordance with the second item. However, the landlord has the right of first refusal. (4) Those related to the welfare of the citizens and whose scale is suitable for municipal administration (such as hospitals, pharmacies, canteens, hostels, etc.) may be operated by the municipal government.</p>

More than 100 representatives from Chinese and foreign real estate companies, construction manufacturers, lawyer accountants, and Chinese and foreign reporters attended. Chairman Chen Shiquan delivered a speech, saying: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's land registration was chaotic, and property rights were problematic. The land property rights of friendly foreign nationals also had many disputes. In order to determine and protect the property rights of Chinese and foreign people, the city's land registration is being held. Three registration offices are now set up at 66 Zhapu Road, 72 Shangwen Road, and 71 Daxi Road to handle land registration matters in Huangpu, Yinxiang, Zhabei, Caohui, Nanshi, and other districts. Property owners can bring their property documents to register. After registration, the Land Administration Bureau will announce it to all sectors of society. If no disputes arise within two months, the property rights of the land will be determined. If the property owner is far away in another place and cannot come to Shanghai to handle the registration procedures for a while, they can apply to this bureau for deferred registration. If the reason is sufficient, it can be approved. Then, the attendees raised various questions related to land registration and property rights, and they were answered one by one.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Finance Bureau Explains Supplementary Collection of Business Tax <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Finance Bureau is currently collecting supplementary business tax for the autumn season. According to an explanation from a person in charge of the Finance Bureau: (1) In order to achieve fairness and reasonableness, supplementary collection is necessary. (2) Regarding the collection of old business tax debts, according to the central government's regulations, the business tax rate was 40 per thousand of the capital amount and 30 per thousand of the turnover. It was only recently that an order was issued to reduce the tax by half. The Finance Bureau, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and to achieve fairness and reasonableness between those who have paid and those who have not, is still collecting supplementary tax according to the old rate. (3) Before the war, business tax was a local tax. During the war, it was temporarily assigned to the central government. This city has been following the central government's regulations. Negotiations are currently underway between the municipal government and the Ministry of Finance, and no decision has been made yet.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association held a public banquet yesterday afternoon at the Lido Garden for 葉楚傖 and 鈕永建, two comfort envoys, and invited Committee Member Pan Gongzhan, Secretary-General Hong Lan-you, Supervising Commissioner Cheng Cang-bo, and renowned lawyer Luo Jia-heng to attend. Mr. Ye Chu-cang was unable to attend due to illness, and Mr. Cheng Cang-bo was absent due to other engagements. The remaining guests arrived on time. Over 20 National Assembly representatives attended, including Wu Shao-shu, Wang Xiao-lai, He Yuan-ming, Wu Wen-tian, and Zhou Xue-xiang. Xi Yu-shu was publicly elected to deliver a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Niu Yong-jian, who said, "The Central Government has decided to end the period of political tutelage and immediately implement constitutional government. The implementation of constitutional government must wait for the National Assembly to produce a constitution before civil governance can be implemented according to the constitution. Due to the Japanese invasion and the August 13th Incident, the eight-year War of Resistance delayed the convening of the National Assembly until recently, when the date of convocation was finally determined. Some have criticized the United States' assistance to China as having ulterior motives, but in fact, the United States' assistance to China comes from sincerity and has absolutely no other purposes. Fortunately, the takeover of the Northeast is proceeding smoothly. The Communist Party's disruption can hopefully be quelled due to justice. At the same time, representatives of various parties to the Political Consultative Conference have arrived in Chongqing. In the near future, meetings will surely proceed smoothly." Subsequently, Hong Lan-you, Luo Jia-heng, Ding Zhong-ying, Zhu Feng-wei, and others delivered speeches, and the event ended at 4:00 PM in a joyful atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Development of Post Office Business, Gradual Recovery of Work Efficiency <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Qi</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Before the victory against Japan, it took at least two days for a local ordinary letter to be delivered in Shanghai. Now, if you mail it in the morning, you can often receive it on the same day.</p>
<p>Wang Yu-guang, a clerk at the Shanghai Postal Administration, told reporters: "We are gradually improving. The development of the post office business is closely related to transportation conditions. Although the post office situation in North and South Ocean areas has not yet returned to normal due to various reasons, letters can still be sent. The personnel who took over the Northeast Post Office once returned to Beiping, but they will soon be able to pass through the pass to perform their duties. Airmail to Europe and the United States currently uses planes of the China-American Aviation Company and occasionally uses the planes of allied countries. Airmail to Europe, the United States and India are sent via Chongqing, and letters to Southeast Asia are sent via Hong Kong."</p>
<p>Overall Plan for Post Office Profits and Losses</p>
<p>After the increase in postage rates, there seemed to be a misunderstanding among the people for a period of time that the increase was too large. Wang Ban-shi said, "Indeed, it seems too expensive to have to pay 20 yuan postage to send a letter from North Sichuan Road to Nanjing Road, but it only costs 20 yuan to send a letter from Shanghai to Xinjiang!" The profits and losses of the post office should be calculated comprehensively based on the situation across the country. At a time when transportation across the country is still quite difficult, even though postage has already increased, it is probably still difficult to make ends meet.</p>
<p>According to reports from this newspaper's Chongqing office, the post office used to lose an average of about 400 million yuan per month. The comparison before and after the price increase is as follows: The income from postage alone in September was 108,008,500 yuan. In October (after the price increase), it was 437,758,900 yuan. The difference is three times. However, the total income in October was 587,136,500 yuan, and the expenditure was 765,137,400 yuan, resulting in a loss of 178,000,900 yuan. In Shanghai alone, there was a surplus of 24,063,800 yuan. The business in November was even more developed, so the surplus was naturally greater.</p>
<p>Collection and Delivery of Parcels in the Yangtze River Basin</p>
<p>Parcels have now resumed collection and delivery in the Yangtze River Basin area. Because many people in Shanghai are anxious to see books and magazines sent from the United States and the United Kingdom, the reporter specifically asked Wang Ban-shi whether such printed materials can currently be mailed. Wang Ban-shi's answer was: "Look!" It turned out that he himself had just received four brand-new copies of "TimesWeek" magazines sent from the United States. However, because the foreign exchange rate has not been announced, it is currently impossible to remit money to foreign bookstores. As soon as the foreign exchange rate is announced, we can order foreign books and newspapers. Before the victory, the enemy puppets took a laissez-faire attitude towards the post office because it was not a profit-making organization. At that time, the post office economy was extremely difficult. Not only was it difficult for employees to maintain their livelihoods, but the more mail there was, the greater the losses became. Now everything has been adjusted, and the 3,000 employees of the entire bureau have received more reasonable treatment. As for some employees who were responsible for organizing the puppet "Postal Workers' Union," they have all been dismissed.</p>
<p>In the past, the post office had many foreign senior officials, but now they have decreased a lot. Their pioneering achievements are worth our gratitude. For example, Mr. Jäpelin, a French national who used to be in Shanghai, put in a lot of effort to protect China's post office. However, he did not have time to see the booming business of the Shanghai Post Office now. He died in Shanghai before our victory.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Introduction to American Literature and Art <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I took a stroll around Nanjing Road and looked at places like Evans Bookstore and Sino-American Bookstore. All I saw were old books; there were simply no new books. The only publications were local English-language newspapers. Then I went to Dahua Magazine Company, which specializes in magazines, and all that was piled on the tables were old magazines from several years ago. There wasn't even a shadow of a new magazine.</p>
<p>Today, I went to visit the United States Information Office in the Sassoon House, and it was completely different. This is a public library provided for the public to read, introducing the various aspects of American politics, economy, science, literature, crafts, agriculture, etc. to the people of Shanghai. Anyone can go in. When I went, the room was already full of readers sitting at four long tables. The magazines placed on the table next to the gate were mostly about agriculture, medicine, and commerce. Among them were two literary publications, one was "Saturday Review of Literature" and the other was "Theatre Arts Monthly"; the former had about ten copies, and the latter was the August and September issues. The August issue had a long article about the yesterday and today of American "musical comedy". This reminded me of the "Foreign Literary News" that I wrote monthly for "Fiction Monthly" from June 1927 to December 1931. For four and a half years, I never stopped. The materials were all provided by the Commercial Press. Xu Diaofu often brought me a large stack of British and American magazines, including "Saturday Review of Literature" and "Theatre Arts". The latter was also preserved in large numbers in the Fudan University Library. I didn't expect that these two publications could last so long in Shanghai, and they were still being published after fourteen years. Compared to our many short-lived publications, they are truly incomparable! However, "Saturday Review of Literature" used to have correspondence on the literary situation of various countries, but now it doesn't. This is a shortcoming.</p>
<p>There were also many books on the bookshelves. The row of bookshelves in the inner room mostly contained specialized scientific books on engineering, technology, physics and chemistry. The three bookshelves in the outer room, the middle one, mostly contained literary books. As far as I can remember, the following books caught my attention: "American Folklore", which collected many American myths, stories and songs; "American Painting", "American Romantic Painting", and "American Photographic Art" all had lengthy introductions and exquisite illustrations; there were also many collections of plays, such as "Twenty Modern American Plays" (this book has sold about ten editions), "Sixteen Representative American Plays", etc.; there was also a kind of "Patriotic Poems and Essays", mostly wartime literature, but not necessarily purely literary, and there seemed to be many political essays. I wanted to find "Wartime American Literature", which discusses the achievements of American literature during the war, but unfortunately I couldn't find it. There were also many other kinds, such as Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" and Lewis's novel "Arrowsmith".</p>
<p>"Soviet Literature and Art" has already published sixteen issues, and the content is very exciting. Do the colleagues at the United States Information Office, such as Mr. Cao Weifeng, the translator of the complete works of Shakespeare, etc., have the interest to create an "American Literature and Art"? And I hope that our English-speaking literary friends can bring a pencil and some paper to the United States Information Office to translate something, in order to work on communicating Eastern and Western culture; or it would be good to simply browse. Let me add a word of explanation: I am not an employee of the United States Information Office, and they have not entrusted me to promote it. I am just responding in the same voice and automatically introducing it. If you want to know a little about new American literature and art works, please don't forget to go to the United States Information Office!</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>The Brevity of History</p>
<p>While talking with Fan Yuqi, Jing Ke listened quietly, his face occasionally turning pale as snow, as if he were pondering something.</p>
<p>"If—" Jing Ke said, but he retracted the words he was about to speak. He looked at Fan Yuqi, then changed his mind, poured wine, and urged everyone to drink, unwilling to continue.</p>
<p>As they drank, they discussed the tense situation. The nation was already facing disaster, and these people, lamenting the times, were filled with intense emotions. Especially Jing Ke, who was eager to serve his country, was exceptionally passionate and generous. He thought of what Tian Guang had just said, of how Prince Dan would use him, and of what Gao Jianli said – that many people thought the strategies of "joining forces" and "horizontal alliances" were no longer effective, and that only boosting morale and serving the country with death remained. He surmised that Prince Dan's intention to heavily rely on him might be precisely to have him serve the country with his death. The only way he could serve his country was by giving his life. The simplest solution, then, was to spill blood within five steps, putting the tyrannical King of Qin to death. However, such an action was not easy. After hearing about the King of Qin's high price for General Fan Yuqi's head, he conceived a plan to meet the King of Qin and carry out the five-step bloodshed. Thinking this, he couldn't help but glance at Fan Yuqi again.</p>
<p>Fan Yuqi, however, stood up slightly, said he had to excuse himself, and walked straight out of the tavern. Jing Ke suddenly seemed to have an idea, and without saying goodbye to Gao Jianli and the butcher, he hurriedly followed him.</p>
<p>"General, we drown our sorrows with wine, and both of us are filled with melancholy. I couldn't bear to part with you so quickly, so I came to accompany you for a walk under the stars."</p>
<p>Fan Yuqi did not expect Jing Ke to catch up, nor did he expect Jing Ke to speak so warmly. Wandering in a foreign land, such sympathy made him particularly excited and moved, and he continued:</p>
<p>"You are so sincere; do you have any insightful views on the current situation?"</p>
<p>"I feel that the situation is so urgent, and the people are being bullied by the King of Qin. We should use the simplest method—" Jing Ke paused here, his eyes fixed on Fan Yuqi.</p>
<p>"May I ask what this method is?"</p>
<p>"I want to die for my country—General Fan, you have suffered humiliation at the hands of the King of Qin, and your parents and clan have been slaughtered. I wonder if you have any ideas?"</p>
<p>Jing Ke saw the painful expression on Fan Yuqi's face, even though he did not immediately answer, which made him shudder.</p>
<p>"Of course, I am willing to sacrifice myself and swear to avenge, to eliminate this tyranny from the world!" He said.</p>
<p>"I want to go alone to see the King of Qin, find an opportunity to assassinate him. That would be the simplest solution, but unfortunately, I am going thousands of miles away and cannot find an excuse to see the King of Qin..." Under the dim starlight, Jing Ke stared intently at Fan Yuqi, his voice unable to continue due to excessive excitement.</p>
<p>He clearly saw Fan Yuqi's whole body shake. He suddenly stopped and muttered, "The King of Qin is offering a high price for my head, so the opportunity for me to help this noble man eliminate tyranny from the world has arrived."</p>
<p>As soon as these words were spoken, Fan Yuqi drew his short sword. Jing Ke saw a flash of cold light, and a head covered in fresh blood fell into his arms. [End]</p>
<h3 id="e108">"Mama Doctor" <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>Scarlett—the mother of the protagonist in "Gone with the Wind"—was not a doctor, but she would treat the black people. Therefore, her relatives and neighbors admired her, thinking she was very capable, even attributing it to her lineage and family education. In fact, there were many mothers like Scarlett's mother in our previous generation; my mother was one.</p>
<p>My mother's diagnostic talent was perhaps even more advanced than Mrs. Scarlett's. Mrs. Scarlett could only treat women's stomachaches and give black children worm medicine. When she encountered major illnesses like typhoid fever, she was at a loss. My mother, on the other hand, could treat everything from major illnesses like consumption that made famous doctors shake their heads to minor ailments like fish bones stuck in the throat. My sister's spitting blood was cured by her. It hasn't recurred for at least ten years.</p>
<p>She had several "family remedies" that I still remember:</p>
<p>Whenever the children had stomachaches, nine times out of ten it was from eating something bad. Quickly boil a bowl of "hawthorn powder" and take it before going to bed, and they would be cured by dawn. If they felt cold in the summer, it was usually from catching a chill after sweating; one dose of "midday tea" would cure all illnesses.</p>
<p>In terms of surgery, she had a kind of "miraculous medicine water." The method of preparing this medicine water, although said to be "passed down from ancestors," was not a "secret recipe" passed on only to sons and not to sons-in-law. I can publicly introduce it here:</p>
<p>Three coins of realgar and a piece of alum are put in a clay pot, soaked in a pot of boiling water, and placed in the sun at noon on the Dragon Boat Festival to bake fiercely. After noon, it is moved to a shady place. Thereafter, in the summer, whether it was a man, woman, old person, or child, as long as their fingers were red and swollen, or sores grew on their foreheads, she would hold that pot of "fairy water" in her hands, praising the effectiveness of the "external medicine water"; she would gently dip a clean, broken writing brush into it and smear a yellow patch on the red area. Regardless of whether it was effective or not, the cold feeling was quite pleasant. However, we were always a little unhappy when we encountered this kind of situation, especially after going to "foreign schools," we objected even more to my mother's "native methods." We often called her "Mama Doctor" behind her back. The so-called "Mama Doctor" was equivalent to the "Mongolian doctor" in the north and the "Jiangxi quack" in the south, even worse than them, because she had no scientific basis and no famous teacher to teach her; she was simply "doing it blindly." But in fact, she rarely made mistakes. Thinking about it now, her medical knowledge, based entirely on experience, was indeed admirable!</p>
<p>In modern America, because of the perfection of social welfare, there is no longer a need for "Mama Doctors" like Mrs. Scarlett. What about China? Among this generation of mothers, at least very few are as brave as my mother in taking on the role of health consultant for the whole family, both internal and external medicine, which I personally find a little regrettable!</p>
<h3 id="e109">Orchid <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>"Orchids are the fragrance of kings," this is an idiom. Indeed, the ancients used orchids as a metaphor for a gentleman who lived independently from the world, hence the saying "orchid in an empty valley."</p>
<p>In my hometown, we planted several pots of orchids in the courtyard, which had been there for more than twenty years. Although there were many other exotic flowers in Fengyuan Garden, I most admired and loved these orchids.</p>
<p>But now, everything seems like a dream. The elegant and fragrant orchids still often make me reminisce and yearn because they have a unique charm. They are not alluring, nor are they charming; they are simply independent, noble, and quiet. Their color and fragrance are otherworldly. They are always draped in light green clothing, with hints of red muscle showing through the thin gauze, smiling to greet people. How lovely is that! They are inherently fraternal; one flower always grows together with four or five sisters, all equally noble, refined, elegant, and delicate, all equally gentle and shy. Their graceful and upright posture is enough to intoxicate and captivate people. Many men of letters in ancient times were captivated, worshiped, and admired them. As for me, although I am not a man of letters, I am also one who particularly worships them.</p>
<p>I was intoxicated by them and always worried about them, as attached to them as to a beloved companion. Leaving them for even half a day or a night always made me feel anxious and uneasy. But since the Japanese pirates extended their devilish claws to my hometown, everything has been devastated. I have no idea what the flowers and trees in my old garden are like, especially whether those few pots of orchids are safe and sound. When it is dry, who waters them? When they bloom, have they been trampled on? Whenever I think about this, I feel as if I have lost a heart. Now that the Japanese pirates have collapsed, I wonder if they can return to normal.</p>
<p>Orchids of my old garden, do you know that your master, thousands of miles away, often thinks about your growth?</p>

<p>— Luo Tiaoyu</p>
<p>The room is clean and unpainted, the scent lingers, the eyebrows are too lazy to paint, only poetry and books are loved to the point of obsession, borrowing the elegance of the plum blossom window, the jade table, the ancients as teachers.</p>
<p>Thinking of the north countryside, flying east to mourn the distant sea, reading about the love and hatred, painting tears in the desolate ruins, the images of righteous people.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Usefulness of Trouble <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people are afraid of "trouble," except when fools are energized.</p>
<p>The Chinese seem to have a special intelligence for psychology. Without having to study or conduct many experiments, they can use it flexibly. For example, if someone is stubbornly clinging to your things, then when you ask for them back, they will give you a "trouble" to make you retreat in the face of difficulty. However, this kind of "trouble" must have some power as a basis.</p>
<p>In China, it seems that things, big and small, fall into this formula.</p>
<p>Someone said that I worshiped Europe and America too much, and gave the examples of the American Civil War and the French Revolution as being caused by great "troubles." I said that was politics, and I didn't have time to study the formula for politics. What I, a playwright, care about at the moment is the theater. I wonder: why did the drama theaters that were taken over become movie theaters, while the Peking opera theaters with direct ownership are still performing Peking opera? When I discovered the reason above, I got an answer. It turns out that those who do drama have neither the intelligence to create "trouble" nor any power to rely on. Moreover, there are few fools in the drama circle, and even if there are, they have not yet reached the point of being energized.</p>
<p>The loss of theaters for drama is because some people have made the mistake of "not working for themselves." But this is another answer besides "not working for themselves." However, being afraid of "trouble" is still "for oneself," so it can still be said to be within the reason of "not working for themselves." If the mistake of "not working for themselves" is made greatly, then the usefulness of "trouble" is also great.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Hoping that the Police Authorities Will Eliminate the Shanghai West "Scalper Dens" <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Xiu</p>
<p>The problem of public security is fundamentally a social problem. If public security is handled poorly, society will naturally lose its foundation of consolidation, and the country will naturally find it difficult to embark on the road of national construction and revival. I am appealing loudly here, hoping that the municipal authorities will quickly solve major problems and never relax on minor problems. The order of each district should be handled as quickly as possible. After victory, perhaps there is another difficult hurdle. Our national fortune should not have so many disasters and never see the light. For example, the current Caojiadu Town in western Shanghai is a concentrated area of ​​poor laborers, so there is a mixture of good and bad, which has invisibly become a special area. Although the small traitor and gambling king Zhu Ni Shunlin is dead, his followers, disciples, and adopted children are increasingly rampant, such as extortion, robbery at night, and theft in the morning. They have recently intensified their efforts and secretly and openly opened scalper dens, with extremely clever methods. For example, in the morning, they are located at a certain number in Lishunli, Bailinan Road, and in the afternoon, they are in a certain teahouse near the triangle field of Caojiadu Town, and in the evening, they are at a certain number in Xinkangli, Kangnao Road, or even moving three times at a time. Several platform footers are sent to the vicinity of the shed, all of whom are disguised as small Shanghai merchants to cover up the eyes and ears of outsiders. But every day, I don’t know how many young men and women spend their precious time in it, and I don’t know how much money earned from sweat is wasted. This scalper den, a great demon cave that harms the country and the people, can still exist in the "New West Shanghai" after the light, which is really a "cancer of West Shanghai." I hope that the police authorities will severely punish the leaders of this scalper den and their accomplices and eliminate this great demon cave that harms people. On the other hand, I hope that the compatriots in western Shanghai will rise up to assist the authorities, maintain public security, and strengthen the foundation of social consolidation.</p>

<p>Lu Mingang is looking for his younger brother, Lu Minquan, 26 years old, from Guangdong. He joined the army and went on an expedition after August 13. He was transferred to Kunming and Burma this spring. There is still no news after the victory. His family is very anxious. If anyone knows his address or recent situation, please write to Lu Mingang, Yaohua Pharmacy, Nanjing Road. We will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Seeking Wu Bu: My nephew, originally named Wu Qilin, is now 28 years old. In the spring of 1938, he took several comrades and joined the military academy with guns.

<p>Tuberculosis Prevention Lecture</p>
<h3 id="e114">On Being Worry-Free About Lung Disease (2) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Health Association</p>
<p>(4) Regulating and Nourishing is a Palliative Treatment</p>
<p>Lung disease is a chronic tuberculosis disease. Although regulating and nourishing can temporarily be effective, no one can guarantee that the disease has been cured, and no one can guarantee that it will not recur in the future. Stubborn tuberculosis bacteria cannot be completely eliminated by regulating and nourishing. On the contrary, long-term regulating and nourishing provides the bacteria with an excellent opportunity to expand their activities. Once they erupt, they will become a prairie fire and cannot be contained. It will be too late to regret. Therefore, regulating and nourishing is actually a palliative treatment that does not benefit and can cause harm. I hope that general wise patients will not be misled and cause their own troubles.</p>
<p>(5) X-ray Examination is a Necessary Tool for Diagnosis</p>
<p>For all diseases, in order to have correct treatment, there must be correct diagnosis. This principle is recognized by the world. Lung disease is a chronic tuberculosis disease that progresses secretly, and patients are often unaware of it. Therefore, it is especially important to have a correct diagnosis in order to not miss the opportunity for correct treatment and achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, in order to obtain a correct diagnosis of lung disease, it is necessary to perform an X-ray examination. Lung disease is a visceral tuberculosis disease, and without X-ray examination, the crux of the problem cannot be seen. During the incubation period, the disease is not obvious, and it cannot be revealed without this. Therefore, patients with lung disease who want to obtain correct treatment must recognize X-ray examination as a necessary tool for diagnosis and be examined as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(6) Early Diagnosis Yields Twice the Result with Half the Effort</p>
<p>The earlier lung disease is discovered, the faster it will be cured. At this time, the virus has not yet spread to the whole body, and as long as there is correct treatment, the goal of complete cure will be achieved. However, lung disease is very mild in the early stage, and patients are often unaware of it. At this time, only X-ray examination can obtain an early and correct diagnosis. Early diagnosis leads to early treatment, which not only yields twice the result with half the effort and saves medical expenses, but also restores health early and leads to early production, benefiting individuals, families, and even society.</p>
