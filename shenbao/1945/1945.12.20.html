<h3>紫金蒼翠巍然無恙　主度瞻竭國父陵寢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕蔣主席十九日午十二時半竭陵，輕車簡從，知者甚鮮。主席瞻仰國父還容時默念達三分鐘，並親在陵園各處視察一週。嗣後主席並赴陣亡將士墓致祭。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕蔣主席十九日午偕夫人往陵園展謁總理陵寢，俞局長濟時隨行。謁陵後，並赴靈谿寺陣亡將士紀念堂及譚故院長墓憑弔良久。主席車抵陵墓前門，徐步拾級而上，約二十分鐘達亭堂，當與夫人並立總理塑像前，呈獻花園，俯首默念三分鐘後，始行最敬禮。禮畢，復瞻仰遺容，默然久之。旋入　堂，繞棺一匝，步出享堂一一檢視堂前祭物。有一巨大銅鼎，八年前爲敵人砲彈所穿，主席當即而論陵園管理委員會警衛處長馬湘，立牌加註，以留永念。溯主席自二十六年十二月八日離京前，拜辭陵墓，西上武漢，指揮抗戰，迄今勝利歸來，重謁寢宮，爲時八年又十日。紫金蒼松翠柏，佳氣蔥鬱，陵關巍然無恙，主席率全黨同志與全國同胞，長期艱苦奮鬥，卒得光復故物，亦可告樹於總理在天之靈矣。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕主席十八日午南行，原擬轉赴他處視察，詞因馬歇爾來華及協商會議開會在即，故而提前離平，主席留平僅一週，已使黨政軍工作漸趨協調，並使不無失望之華北人心重趨振奮。十八日主席離平消息傳出後，民衆依依惜別，多於朔風怒號中自動列隊街頭，竚候歡送，主席汽車過處，歡呼之聲高入雲霄，主席夫婦於車中頻頻揮手答禮，對故都民衆似亦不勝依蘇者。</p>
<p>〔中央社電慶十九日電〕外長王世杰，奉蔣主席召，於十九日晨一時，專機飛京，行政院張參事平羣同行。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十九日電〕蔣主席離平前，曾手令冀省主席孫連仲稱：翼全省各縣市禁毒禁烟，亦應照平津二市，限收復之後三個月內，一律禁絕。否則應將予各該地方主管長官，以失職處治。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾今日抵滬　無多勾留即赴京竭蔣主席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美新任駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，將於今日午後飛抵此間。市長錢大鈞·副市長何德奎·中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁中將，及其他中美長官，均準備赴江灣機塲歡迎。馬帥下機後，即將檢閱我新六軍派赴機場迎候之儀仗隊，及美憲兵儀仗隊。市府當局昨已着手準備錢市長招待馬帥之盛會，惟日期及地點，須待馬帥抵滬後再行決定。據美軍總部息：馬帥抵滬後，即將赴華懋飯店休息，當日或將招待本市新聞記者。美新聞聯絡官，定於今午十一時四十五分，陪同記者赴機場迎候。馬帥在滬擬作一二日勾留。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山電台十九日廣播稱……蔣主席將於明日飛滬，會晤馬歇爾。蔣主席表示渠願與共黨獲得和平之解決，同時，目前在渝之共軍參謀長葉劍英亦表示願意放下武器。又訊：外長王世杰已飛南京，將助理蔣主席接見馬歇爾將軍。中國觀察家認爲蔣主席將在南京與馬歇爾會晤，然後伺時出發至中國各地視察，蔣主席與馬歇爾在南京的有數日之勾留，同機赴渝，參加政治協商會議。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕年已六十有六之美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，已定今日下午一時，抵達江灣機場。此間各中美首長，均已約定前往機場迎迓。馬氏將下榻華懋飯店，魏德邁將軍所居住之房間。此間美戰區司令部，並爲馬帥準備此間僅有之大辦公桌，以備馬氏願用，此辦公桌原爲美戰犯審理委會主任韋斯少校所用。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼拉十九日電〕美國新任駐華特使馬歇爾將軍，已於今日下午飛抵馬尼拉，較預定時間早兩小時半。馬氏下機後，立即乘車巡視殘破之馬尼拉市，並擬於明日上午飛往中國，當日可抵上海。今日據華人方面電稱：馬氏抵滬後，將晋京與蔣主席會晤，然後同行赴渝。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕英駐菲律賓總督麥克納，茲定於今日下午四時許，由馬尼刺抵滬。麥氏在滬擬稍作勾留，並將與馬歇爾元帥及魏德邁上將舉行重要商談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十九日電〕今日據接近主席方面消息，預期主席將於南京會晤馬歇爾元帥，（昨日主席告某記者謂：渠將於歷訪前佔領區各大城市之途次，會晤美新任駐華大使馬歇爾云。）主席對於杜魯門總統對華政策聲明之反響，據接近主席方而息；頗示好感。據謂：杜總統此項報告，主席駐節北平時，僅看過一次，在適當時期之內，當再予詳細閱讀云。據最高華人方面透露：蔣主席旅平時，曾密切注視東北局勢，據謂：渠對於長春每日「進行順利」之中蘇談判，感覺愉快。在平期間，渠同時亦密切注視華北軍民撤退上有關各項問題。接近主席方面，曾強調日本軍民有加速撤退之必要，因不久美軍船隻即將無可利用，彼等希望全部日軍於兩月之內撤盡，並估計尚有日軍四百萬人留在中國，臺灣，北部越南，曁東北九省。處於長城廣州之問者，已有日人一百萬之多，而其中半數爲軍人</p>
<h3>各黨代表會議在即　樂觀程度益增高　對馬歇爾來華寄以厚望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十九日電〕據此間各觀察家稱：國共雙方代表，尤其是共黨代表，在未來和平談判中將讓步至限度，雙方均欲向美國特使馬歇爾表明其渴望和平之誠心。</p>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕中國今日，希望已較戰爭結束時爲高。自國軍由陸路開入東九省，前鋒迫近瀋陽，或業已入城，而解決內爭之樂觀潮流即由此起。益以美國新任駐華特使馬歇爾將軍已由華盛頓起程來華，蔣主席　蒞北平，視察華北紛擾核心，杜魯門總統復宣布美國政策，呼籲國共停戰，由各大政黨代表舉行全國會議，因此樂觀程度更增。馬氏之抵華，各方面皆屏息以待，期望甚大。國民黨方面當然希望多保留前大使赫爾利計劃，殊未知美總統任命一强有力人物如馬歇爾將軍者，豈僅爲實行赫氏不可否認之援助中央政府計劃，毫無變更。駐華美軍於馬氏來華亦甚關切，內中多深信中國內戰不止，彼等即不能重返家園，若馬氏此來，能使中國恢復和平，即可肅淸美軍回國之障礙。此外尚有外間所不注意者，即外商於馬氏此行亦正殷切期待。彼等皆恐中國新公司法將限制其營業，且深以通貨膨脹及中國戰後態度不定爲慮，現紛紛揣測，美國任命此偉大人物爲駐華特使，在對華貿易方面行將更謀進取，或求得一永久的領導權乎。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>歡迎馬歇爾特使</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統特使馬歇爾元帥，來華履新，計程本日可到上海。特使此來，必將有利於吾國，必將有利於東亞秩序的安定，必將有利於世界和平。中國人民對於馬歇爾元帥之奉使來華，寄予殷切之期望。元帥以傑出的軍事領袖，賴了他的運籌帷幄，卒獲致光榮的勝利，是其功蹟，不僅盡在其本國，抑在整個世界，整個人類。如今敵寇降伏，元帥功成身退，理應小憇林泉，而乃勞瘁不辭，又膺新命，萬里來華。我們首先對杜魯門總統選擇像元帥這樣一種人物來華充其特使，表示由衷的感奮；而元帥的不辭勞瘁，遠來中國，允表欣慰。馬歇爾元帥不僅是一位傑出的軍事領袖，且又是一位超越的外交能手，爲國際間所一致推崇。此次來華，深信必能運用其卓越的軍事的及外交的才能爲中國，爲遠東，爲世界和平立下不可磨滅的功業。</p>
<p>的確，中國局勢的如何推移關係整個世界的和平。美國在擊潰軸心的努力上，祖當了最重的負荷；在世界和平的重建上，因此，也担當着最重的負荷。從杜魯門選擇像元帥這種人物來華充其特使的這一點上，可知美國如何關心中國局勢的展開。在使中國局勢明朗化的過程中，就需要像馬歇爾元帥那樣兼具有軍事外交雙方才能的傑出人物。在特使初臨中國國土之際，中國人民謹致其熱誠的歡迎。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾特使　本報次料室</h3>
<p>當馬歇爾元帥於十一月二十七日膺命担任駐華特使之際，我們便借本報一角告訴讀者說，馬歇爾元帥是保證美國安全的象徵。今天是他來華腹新的日子，我們要添說幾句，他是促成中國統一與遠東安全的象徵。</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥在美國，早就被證實他是担任民主政治軍職中最適當的人物，無論參議院或衆議院，民主黨或共和黨，對於他，都一致寄以完全的信仰。同樣的，在中國，無論朝野，無諭國共或其他政黨，都已承認他是一個偉大的力量與希望。這一點，在他未來的工作中，將獲得具體的證明。</p>
<p>馬帥和中國及遠東的關係，並不始於今日，應該遠溯到第一次歐戰前後，他曾經兩度來遠東研究軍事形勢，前後達兩年之久。在戰前，他是以下級軍官的身分而來的，但他已經充分表現了可驚的軍事天才。在戰後，由於他在策劃作戰能力上的强大發揮，再加上潘興將軍對他的賞識與器重，他便躍升了軍事地位，得以佩上准將的星章。一九〇二年，曾一度駐節菲鳥，翌年離任返美。迨一九一三年，他重赴菲島後，服務了三年之久。他在第一次歐戰期間，曾自動前往東九省（共時稱東三省）視察日俄戰爭作戰地區的實情。一九二四年初，馬帥（其時任中校職銜）又來華，供職於美國第十五旅，駐節天津，那時他爭取了很多機會，前往我國各地旅行。一九二七年，他担任過美軍華語訓練班監督。由道一段悠久的歷史看來，馬歇爾將軍已是第三度來華了，每一次他的資望不同，任務也不同，但其成功則一。唯其因爲他過去的種種勳業，我們才相信他會在未來的工作上完成更多的勳業。</p>
<p>馬帥對於民主精神的高度發揚，値得我們强調指出，不但在政治上，甚至在軍事上，他處處流露着可愛的民主傾向。譬如他論及官佐選拔方法的時候，他就提到應該改進軍隊的要素，而軍隊的要素在於保持各級官佐的優秀質素，所以他認爲官佐的選拔，應該出之以民主的辦法。凡能幹而長於領導的官佐，都得給他們求深造的機會，養成良好的將才。</p>
<p>尤其在目前中國尙未完全統一，各方期望馬帥賜予協助之處正股，他携來了美總統杜魯門的訓令，在這方而必有新的計劃和新的展開。正如他過去能以兩年的功夫完成德國人費了十年光陰的武力政治之下才能做到的工作那樣的速度，他一定能在極短的時間內，協助我國縮短各政黨與國民政府之間的距離，並且，如果這中間還有什麼間隔存在着的話，則馬帥富能竭其全力來使它予以根本的消除，使各政黨眞能團結在國民政府的周圍，在最高領袖蔣主席指揮之下，臻於完全統一的領域。</p>
<p>說到他的工作態度，馬帥向以嚴肅認眞博取了世人的祟仰。精力的飽滿，爲靑年將校所不及，他愛惜光陰，嚴守規律，自任參謀總長以來，從沒有告過一天假，如果在他的辦公室裏發見一塊缺席牌的時候，那麼他一定是乘着他的飛機去視察什麼，決不會是爲了私事的。視察飛行，是他的習慣之一，只要時間允許，他往往躬親出發，實地視察，決不肯僅憑別人的耳目作主觀的判斷。由於這種生活精神和習慣，我們相信他此次來華，也必定會從深刻的觀察中設法解決一切擺在他眼面前的問題，而且結果也必然圓滿。</p>
<p>馬帥今年以六十五歲的高齡來膺任駐華特使的工作，許　人或許將爲他的健康擔心，其實，看起來，他還好像只是三四十幾歲那樣年靑。他不知道什麼呌辛勞，什麼呌疲倦，他只知道工作第一。聯合國方面對他的欽敬也就在這一點。在這次戰爭中，他竟能應付了九個戰區之多，指揮了分佈在六大洲的部隊，佈置了各戰區的作戰計劃，還要以各種必要的供應品分配給到各戰區。同時，他又與美國會，海軍部，國務院及白宮方面，保持密切的聯緊，與他的部下從事於親切的指導。看他過去這樣的工作情形，他簡直是美國人所謂「好像看一部完備調整和馬力强大的機器推動着工作」一樣。</p>
<p>麥帥的機密性是令人震驚的。他理解着要幹得好，必須幹得機密。馬帥作戰時期，有一次，十四天之內，在德軍面前調動過一百萬人和他們的裝備，竟沒有引起敵人的注意與訪備，此點就可以看出其特殊能力之所在。</p>
<h3>張蔣飛京竭主席報告　接收技術待協商　國軍空運陰滯主要在氣候</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕張嘉璈·蔣經國，十九日晨九時離平飛京，向主席報告一切。張行前告本報記者，我遲遲未接收東北，非純因外交問題，我自身仍尚有若干問題待解決，如冬季服裝之籌備等，即其一例。張·蔣應主席電召，本定十七日飛平報告，當時因長春氣候至零下二十餘度，飛機凍結，無法起飛，致晚來一日，未及在平謁見主席。記者從各方探悉，中·蘇談判原則已定，惟尚有若千技術問題待續協商。當局鑒於上月東北行營移平股鑒，故此次對軍政接收事宜特爲愼重，決俟問題全部解決，始行前往接收。上次張嘉璈氏過平時，曾否認重慶中蘇談判涉及東北工礦問題，但一般相信，東北之經濟開發問題，仍爲白山黑水間最後一朶島雲</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山電台十九日廣播稱：據最後消息，中蘇談判已獲結束。杜筆明軍隊可立即遣派「聯絡隊」赴俄軍防區。目前長春氣候嚴寒，在零度下二十二度，飛機結冰，無法發動，此係國軍空運延　之主要原因。某報稱：共黨在張家口屠殺平民二萬人，其「罪狀」爲「反共」。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十八日電〕我軍事代表團團長董彥平，今日下午三時，與蘇軍參謀長特洛會科中將，作第二度會談，對雙方軍事聯絡問題，有所決定。我東北保安司令長官司令部，即可派遣聯絡官與蘇軍聯絡。本日會談共歷二小時，黃特兩氏不日將再作第三度談話。</p>

<h3>美總統昨咨請國會　建議改設國防部　海陸兩部合併空軍設三支部力主準備一切應付原子戰爭</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統今日咨請國會將海陸軍兩部改為單獨之國防部，以便向全世界說朗美國已鄭重其事，在此原子戰爭時期，準備一切。杜魯門總統提出警告曰：未來戰爭之爆發，較諸過去之戰爭，將更為突如其來，而美國極可能首當其衝，目前海陸軍之合併將為準備應變之最有效步驟。杜總統此項極明白之建議，顯係陸軍部之絕對勝利。建議共包括七點，另附關於十八至二十歲靑年實施强迫軍訓之請求。該項建議，旣與陸軍部之計劃完全符合，是則反對此種計劃之海長福萊斯特爾及海次　生等勢必將提出辭呈，或公開與總統衝突，否則唯有中止反對。杜魯門總統請求國會通過下列各點：（一）成立單獨之國防部，擔負一切國家完全之全部賣任，包括目前海陸兩部所有之武裝及民衆力量。（二）國防部長將屬於由總統所任命之文官充之，另有非軍事人員之副部長及助理多人，（三）航空隊將分為三支部，每一支部均由一副部長主持之，結果將建成一統一之空軍，但海軍將保留單獨之航空母艦及水上根據地之空軍隊伍。（四）所有副部長及助理部長均將接受總統或國防部長所指定之工作。（五）總統及國防部長均將有權設立配合與服務之機關，此項機關將分設於獲得物資之地點，以便减低開支。（六）國防部將委任參謀總長一人，及隸屬其下之海陸空軍司令三人。（七）參謀總長及海陸空軍司令三人將組一咨詢委會，向總統提出各項建議，（八）為避免過份偏重任何一部份起見，杜發門總統建議參謀總長之任命，應採用輪流制，最低每二年或三年輪流一次。總統之結論宣稱：「本人敢向國會保證，此種合併一旦被採為國策後，無論文官或武官，必將盡力使此種合併獲得成功也。」</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕波的摩爾太陽報謂，據權威方面報告，社魯門內閣之重要人員華萊斯·伊克斯·福萊斯特爾·及法官許華倫巴赫，將於一九四六年辭職。白宮對此項報告，拒絕證實或否認。波的摩爾太陽報謂，華萊斯辭商務部長職後，將領導左翼民主黨。內政部長伊克斯則將辭職度其私人生活。勞工部長許華倫巴赫法官，則擬於明年辭職後競選華盛頓州參議員，海長福萊斯特爾亦擬於明年辭職。</p>
<h3>近衛文麿回憶錄所載　蘇聯參戰前政策　願加入德義日同盟支配東方圖將伊朗印度劃入蘇勢力圈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕近衛文磨自殺後，其所遺回憶錄，載有蘇聯在一九四〇年後期曾於原則上承認加入德義日三國同盟，變爲四協約國，以支配東方。按照所附秘密協定，伊朗·印度成爲蘇聯未來之勢力範圍，日本得南洋，德國取中非，義大利得北非，但此項計劃未獲進步。於原則上成立協定後三個月，德國官場即公開談論德蘇戰爭。日本嘗向德政府正式提議避免對蘇戰爭，但被德方擱置不顧，謂德蘇戰爭可於兩三個月內結束。近衛曾强烈暗示，彼與日本均爲柏林害人之强權政治所愚，並謂德蘇兩國皆未重視成立協約。日外相松岡知德蘇有發生戰爭可能，因與蘇聯簽訂中立條約，以鞏固日本地位。近衛曾一再提及日本盼望蘇聯加入三國協約，以與蘇聯及軸心國家接近。德國至少在一九四〇年十一月蘇聯人民外交委員畏莫洛托夫訪問柏林以前，係向日德蘇合作之途邁進。德外長李賓特洛甫曾提出四强協定計劃，包含下列各點：（一）蘇聯宣言同意三國協約原則，以防止戰爭並協助迅速恢復和平。（二）蘇聯承認德義日三國在歐亞新秩序中之領導地位，三國亦允保證尊重蘇聯領土。（三）三國已保說勿援助任何盟國之敵人，亦不參加此等國家集團。此外並規定成立關於未來勢力範圍之秘密協定。日政府立即贊成此項計劃，莫洛托夫訪問柏林時，德方亦曾向之提出，惟直至一九四一年三月松岡赴德時爲止，東京方面此後即未聞其下落云</p>
<h3>美助我建海軍　我極表歡迎</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕海軍部長福萊斯特爾提議以剩餘美國艦船供中國利用後，中國駐美海軍參贊劉廷富少將今日談稱：「截至目前爲止，余尚無機會研究提案全文，但美國在該一方面之任何援助，敢信必爲中國所歡迎」。</p>
<h3>亞洲美使領館　行將大事擴充</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕美國務院視察員蒲特立克，甫由海外歸來，預料美在亞洲使領館，自華北至柬印度，將大加擴充。蒲氏曾在亞洲旅行三月，已使中國，香港，越南，馬來半島及東印度之多數美國領事館重行開門，由一部份人員先行辦公，不久即可增加至平時人數，俾與亞洲美國人民及美國利益以適當保障，其他使領機關，亦將立即恢復。蒲氏於戰事初起時，曾任北平美國大使館代辦。</p>
<h3>賠償會美代表　鮑萊提報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕日賠償委會美總統特派專員鮑萊，向杜魯門提出臨時報告書，同時將向蘇聯及對於日本要求賠償各國提出。據鮑萊稱，日本在戰時，人口每平方公里有一百五十四人，故該國經濟，在出產方面無法應付賠償。更自朝鮮台灣等地勻已割去，日人絡續回國，則其人口每平方公里將達二百零八人，給養相當困難。至於日皇裕仁私人收入如何，並無統計，惟美國賠償官員視日皇一如其他日本人，彼所有財富，亦當取作賠償之用。</p>
<h3>美駐韓總督　昨日抵漢城</h3>

<h3>三強會議益見緊張　入具體討論階段　內容嚴寒秘密迄今未見發表公報蘇人民對史達林重理國事歡迎</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕三强外長會議昨日開會歷三小時又二十分鐘之久，會後仍未發表文告，預料今日繼續開會時情形，當益見緊張。三外長之顧問中，有巴爾幹問題·伊朗問題·管治德國問題。及遠東問題之專家，可見此等問題均當提出討論，據悉，初期會議中之空氣確極友好</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕三强外長會議，進行殊爲秘密。權威方面僅謂會議有良好之開端，此外僅悉昨夜之會議，或已進入具體討諭之階段。其他情形殊非外界所能獲悉。觀察家猜測，昨日下午由美國務卿員爾納斯主特之談話，如確已進入具體討論之階段，經過當較前次之談話爲長。迄至目前爲止，與會代表似仍在討論技術上之問題。英外相貝文於昨日下午開會前，曾訪莫洛托夫。消息靈通方面謂貝文及貝爾納斯均當謁見史達林致敬。俄人對史達林之銷假歸來，重理國事，咸表歡迎。貝文對伊朋事件殊爲關心，昨又再度接見英駐伊大使蒲拉特垂詢一切。貝爾納斯亦召見其隨員，德黑蘭美國使館之伊朗問題專家一人，甫自德黑蘭抵蘇京，向貝爾納斯有所報告。又據本社華盛頓消息：美京可靠方面謂三强外長會議，當談及西班牙問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕莫斯科會議之秘密狀態，雖亦有其理由，然蘇聯之加緊實行新聞封鎖與之亦不無關係。良以此次議程最主要者如原子問題及伊朗問題，對於世界全部均有重大關係，故不得不嚴守外交上之秘密。蘇聯之新聞檢查制在本年十月底以後，曾一度放鬆，在十一月內以及十二月之初，莫斯科之通訊員均獲合理發送新聞之自由，迨至三强會議舉行前之不久，始又趨嚴厲。</p>
<h3>美反諜報部接收　日特務機關　爲東條控制民衆工具秘密刑塲將經常開放</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕美國反諜報部今日正式接收日本特務機關，（又稱「恐怖隊」司令部）。此所俯臨宮城壕溝之淡灰色現代建築，作爲司令部已有十年之久。此建築共四層，據傳其中雨層，即爲令人談虎色變之特務隊所佔，由此發　指使，遂令東條首相能絕對控制日本民衆。在其地室中嘗有各階層之日人，以及美國人，被秘密監禁，私刑拷打。司令部內有自備之電話設備，接通各部門，並裝有强力無綫電收發機，與遠東各地特務隊，直通聲氣。一九四〇年路透社東京分社主任柯克司，即係由此屋四　樓窗口躍下而死。據當時日本泰晤士報載稱：柯克司於該年七月十九日與「若干人數未詳之外國人」一同被逮，柯克司爲「避免洩漏秘密」而自盡。特務隊亦宣稱：獄吏曾設法制止之，但美國官方結論，則謂彼若非迫於酷刑而自窗口躍下，即爲被日人所推墮。嗣後於珍珠港被襲之日，聯合國記者俱被執於此特務隊司令部，以「間諜」罪，加以訊問。聯合社東京分社主任喜爾氏亦在其中。據美國反諜報部某偵查員稱二現任外相吉田亦嘗被囚於水門汀地下室中，與外界音訊隔絕達四十五日之久。在鄰室中，東京美以美會主敎菅井嘗被禁錮一百五十日。據告美國偵查員稱：曾有美B29型機師三人，亦在該時被執，但旋均獲釋。今日簡短之接收典禮中，刻有「日本人權法」之石碑，上覆美國國旗，舉行揭幕，以示日本人民因美軍佔領而獲解放。嗣後該屋不復爲秘密刑場，將經常開放，以聽取日本人報告疾苦。</p>
<h3>伊朗問題　三強合作試金石</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕今日高級官方告合衆社謂：史達林委員長之返莫斯科，使貝爾納斯國務卿與貝文外相獲有較好機會，使蘇聯退出伊朗，並使三强對伊朗問題成立符合德黑蘭宣言之協定成爲可能。該方面認爲亞塞爾拜然自治政府之設立，旣成已成事實，莫洛托夫顯不願有所讓步，致招史達林之不歡。然如貝爾納斯與貝文提出該項問題，作爲三强繼續和好無間之基礎，史達林可能重行考慮。合衆社獲悉，貝爾納斯接受亞省政府爲代表人民意志者，力主該項間題必須根據德黑蘭協定予以商討。據消息靈通方面稱，貝文將以最堅決態度支持貝爾納斯，但用意稍有不同，並謂英方恐　蘇聯侵入中東。合衆社獲悉，美國宮吏對於伊朗局勢深爲關心。因彼等相信世界之能否在聯合國推動下和好無間，伊朗問題爲最清楚之試騐。</p>
<h3>英美代　不斷與本國接觸</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十九日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯與英外相以及英美駐莫斯科使節，每日以無錢電或直接電話，與各該國政府不斷接觸，設氣候允許，英國傳達員每日乘機飛赴倫敦。貝文外相使英國各自治領對會議情形充份明瞭，而中法兩國大使隨時能與貝文與貝爾納斯接觸，衆信貝爾納斯與貝文將於星期五日或該日前晋謁史達林委員長，是日適爲史氏壽辰。</p>
<h3>伊朗籲請尊重　德黑蘭宣言　變亂仍蔓延中</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十九日電〕伊朗總理哈基米昨日在議院歡呼聲中，復聲言決議前往莫斯科，並當再請英美蘇三國撤退駐伊軍隊。又悉，伊朗北部之民主派正向裏海推進，伊北之動亂恐已不能防止其不向伊拉克及土耳其之寇治部落蔓延。又據伊朗駐英大使在倫敦發表談話，指蘇聯以各種方式干涉伊朗事件，實屬公然違背一九四三年十二月之德黑蘭宣言。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕伊朗駐英大使發表聲明稱：伊朗深　莫斯科會議能成立協定，尊重伊朗主照之完整，目前正値聯合國機稱成立之時，而伊朗國內之一部份地區，竟發生指使人民否認本國政府發動分裂運動之事，誠令伊朗人民不勝痛心而失望。此乃違背條約之悲痛例子，堪爲戰後各方面是否尊重條約，大西洋憲章，聯合國憲章，及三強共同宣言之測騐。</p>
<h3>英戰時首相　將赴美休息</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕每日郵報今日載稱：前首相邱吉爾即將赴美休憇，又據工黨日報載稱：邱吉爾此行，爲辭退保守黨黨魁先聲。</p>
<h3>月全蝕　爲密雲所掩</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕全部月蝕於昨晨零點三十七分開始，惟以天空有密雲，故月亮完全爲其所蔽。</p>
<h3>東印度民衆　遊行示威　派遣英軍至爪哇聯合參謀部決定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社爪哇蘇卡泰十九日電〕東印度居民一萬五千人，今日在爪哇遊行示威。獨立派領袖發表演說，以爪哇將常保獨立爲言。共和國總統索卡諾稱，「荷蘭已開始動搖，荷蘭帝國主義必須崩潰。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕國務院發言人麥克特莫脫宣稱：派遺英軍前往荷屬東印度事，早在日本投降前即由聯合參謀部決定。此項軍隊係派與東南亞司令部，俾協助接受日軍投降與繳械，並保護當地被拘留之平民的十萬名，該項聲明之發出，旨在駁斥某方引證國務院某發言人而發出之一項消息，內稱，對於反抗爪哇國民軍之現行軍事行動，美國應與英國分擔責任云云。</p>
<p>荷蘭聲明立塲</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十九日電〕蘭發言人昨稱：荷蘭完全允許印度尼西亞人，有自行生存及自由發展之權，惟荷蘭決不接受擯除荷人負擔安全與法理最後責任之辦法。范莫克副督前此之聲明，原可作爲良好之談判基礎，然竟未予十分注意。荷人不論政治問題最後如何解決，仍準備盡力與印度尼西亞人合作，以解決逐漸增長中之經濟困難。</p>
<p>吧城迤南激戰</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十九日電〕協約軍巡羅隊一隊，在吧城迤南三十哩處之布伊登　格附近一帶巡　時，沿途爲印度尼西亞人約三百名所襲擊，發生激戰。</p>

<h3>聯合國首屆大會　或將展期揭幕　因數國代表未能及時趕到　美衆院通過全力參加法案</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕聯合國籌備委員會全體會議，昨一致同意於明年一月十日在威斯特敏斯特之中央廳，舉行聯合國全體大會之第一次會議。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十八日專電〕聯合國大會之日期，由於某種未曾預料之原因，將有改變。籌委會於決定明年一月十日爲開會日期之兩小時後，美代表史蒂芬生（美國務卿特別助理）要求將大會日期延至一月十二日或十四日，因渠適接華盛頓電話，載運美國及拉丁美洲各國代表至倫敦之瑪麗皇后號，已將起碇日期由一月三日改至七日，故各代表於十二日始能抵倫敦。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕衆議院頃以三四四票對十五票批准美國全力參加聯合國機構，包括以美軍供安全理事會調遣等，惟以衆院外委會建議應許美國議員以代表資格，列席聯合國機構之全體大會。故在將該案呈交杜魯門總統簽字前，參院尚須重予討論。該法案授權總統於經過兩院多數票之同意後，得與安全理事會談判協定，以規定安全理事會所得調遣美軍之數量及性質。</p>
<p>英代表團人選發表</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕昨在下院宣布出席聯合國全體大會之聯合王國代表團，由阿特里首相率領，代表有外相貝文·國務大臣培克·敎育大臣威金森小姐·司法大臣蕭克羅斯爵士隨席代表爲財政部財政秘書霍爾。外部次官麥克尼爾。印度事務部次官漢特森·殖民部次官　斯·工黨議員揚格少校。揚克現爲律師，曾從事諜報工作。</p>
<h3>英叛國罪犯　愛梅立絞決</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕每日晚報載稱：前印度事務大臣愛梅立之子的翰，已於今晨九時（上海時間下午五時）在溫治華斯監獄執行絞決，數秒鐘內即告畢命。其父於昨夜猶持大批致每一內閣閣員之信函，至下議院擬利用其地位，延長其子之生命，其所持理由爲約翰健康狀態欠佳。</p>
<p>約翰於上月在中央刑庭受審時，對所控八罪，完全承認，故於八分鐘內即行宣判。此舉殊出其家屬及辯護律師之意外，大的係恐審判迤延日久，有汚家聲之故。的翰現年三十三歲，於二十歲時即已觸犯汽車行駛規則七十四次，二十四歲時肢控破產，計負債五〇八一鎊，而資產則毫無。渠本人告破產淸理員，謂所耗費於娛樂及旅行之金錢逾三千鎊·一九三三年的約翰會至上海在報紙訪員，戰事發生時渠適在法國之里維埃拉，一度送入僑民集中營，出營後即煽動僑民加入軍隊，與蘇聯作戰，其後又赴柏林，爲納粹担任廣播，一九四五年四月協約軍向義大利北部推進，的翰圖逃未果，爲義大利之愛國份子所捕。今晨執行絞決時，僅若干兵士及平民六名在場，在執行前之數小時，即有汽車一輛停候監獄之外，車中坐男女各一，有謂此即約翰之兄裘利安愛梅立。</p>
<h3>英上議院准　英美借欵協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕上議院昨以九十票對八票，通過政府所提接受英美借款協定之動議，同時對布萊頓森林國際貨幣協定亦予批准。反對借款協定之皮佛勃魯克勳爵，在投票前曾發表演說，謂政府有銀行家爲其後盾，目前社會主義者已與銀行家結成同一陣綫，故反對政府動議之人當不免失敗。渠並不責備美國所提條件苛刻，美國可謂博愛主義者，惜此項協定並不適合英國之經濟，故吾人一方面應當感謝美國之好意，一方面則應當拒絕。</p>
<h3>英萄沿海一帶　狂風肆虐</h3>
<p>五年來所未有</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕昨日英吉利海峽狂風怒號，風之速度每小時達七十哩，因以海濤汹湧，拍擊海堤，至形猛烈。輪船多艘夜中皆避泊第爾之外，白利頓附近之羅汀登鎭，有水雷一枚漂至岸上爆炸，全鎭爲之震動，玻窗全爲震碎，財產頗受損失。白利頓之房屋因有其他水雷在海中爆炸，亦爲震動，不列顚全部皆感受狂風之威力，沿海一帶狂風之警告終日未停。</p>

<p>對杜總統宣言　主席表欽佩</p>
<p>記者問（以下簡稱問）主席對於美國總統杜魯門最近宣言聲明美國對華政策之意見如何？主席答（以下簡稱答）：杜魯門總統深知中國情形，尤其對中國現在情形更爲瞭解，其最近宣言，表現對華友誼深學，至堪欽佩。問：</p>

<h3>馬歇爾將軍　怎樣獲得成功的　譯自紐約前鋒論壇報</h3>
<p>前任美陸軍參謀總長馬歇爾將軍是歷史上擊敗德日空前大戰中寥寥可數的軍事首要之一。他於一九三九年九月一日進入美國策劃作戰的最高機構任參謀總長。其時，德軍方湧入波蘭。美正規軍配備低劣，人數還不及廿萬名，建軍的結果，使美軍目前的實力已逾八百萬名。他於留在華府策劃制勝敵人戰略的歲月中，始終渴望親身參與實地作戰工作。他幾乎得到領導盟軍進攻歐洲的任務，可是爲了羅斯福總統和邱吉爾首相認爲他是策劃盟軍作戰計劃不可或缺的人物，他的願望終於沒有實現。</p>
<p>他的出身，並非西點軍事學校，他於充任軍中見習士官和弗及尼亞軍校足球隊員後，於一九〇一年畢業於弗及尼亞軍校。翌年，馬歇爾當即奉命前往菲島，以中尉銜供職於第卅步兵師。此後，他就回國繼續求學，旋又受任陸軍軍官學校及參謀學校敎官，嗣即重返菲律賓。</p>
<p>當他於匆促的一瞬間擬具一份佔領馬尼刺計劃書（作爲演習之用的）時，他的司令官比爾少將，告其他軍官說：「諸位，請你們看看爲欲爾將軍他是傑克遜以來美國的最大軍事天才」。</p>
<p>第十次大戰時，他本想參加實地作戰工作，然而爲了他的上峯很賞識他的策劃作戰的天才。終於他先後在歐洲美第一師統帥部和第一軍祖任參謀工作。他規劃佔領肯的尼和一九一八年八五的投降高潮。此後，他策劃並成功地實行了上次大戰中戰績最輝煌的戰役，即在兩週間完成抽調大軍八十二萬名準備激烈的慕斯亞根尼大攻勢的工作。他贏獲了潘興將軍的讚譽。於大戰結束潘興將軍主持參謀總部後，他受任副官，偕同潘興將軍返回華府。費了五年時間，從事重組並健全加利福尼亞州陸軍學校。於一九三六年經是時參謀總長克里格將軍擢升他爲准將。二年後克里格將軍任命他爲副參謀總長·於一九三九年一躍而爲參謀總長。自是以後，他就成爲盟國强大軍事威力後的主腦。騎馬·泛舟·網球·電影，是他的公餘消遣。他從未忘却自己是一個步兵和最喜愛戰鬥的人。</p>

<h3>迎蔣主席</h3>
<p>祖國康復，途四月矣。捷書初布，舉國若狂。凡相需過殷者，相過每疎；望治太切者，失望亦甚。於是生事日日　，亂象日日滋，　之所需所望，皆如雲捲飈散，小復可得，而民間之怨尤　相應而生矣。實則怨允之的，出於人謀之小臧者半，出於惡勢之必然者半，英諺有所謂Necessary　evil者。事無前例，變起倉小，備豫未周，範圍過大，共負而收攝僞制，正而健樹新猷，不能有著手即得期月已可之效，理之固然。恆民不諳政治理數，情之所發，動形責備，責備之極，怨誹以繁。夫今日人心有所未平，生活有所未安，自非無目，豈云未睹？然人窮則反本，疾痛慘怛，未嘗不呼父母，種種怨誹之中，而仍油然葆其樂生之心，欣然展其不斷之望者，若謂「亂則亂矣，事限於一時，言亦非一端，有若入在，吾屬何患而已，」非有他也。</p>
<p>何以明之？自此月十一日蔣主席蒞平以來，榆關內外，萬萬以上之人衆，歡聲宙動，得未曾有。凡主席之一言一動，所爲短長抑揚高下疾徐之狀，經電機如量表顯，波送遠邇，聞者不啻若自其口出，甚　感激至於涕零，在東北九省，勢允章章不掩。日者主席折而南來，飛駕抵都，萬衆郊迎，而滬濱人士允蘄一見顏色。其民氣之盛，人望之熱，毫不減於車從滯燕京時。就中許人陳訴疾苦，申述枉曲，收文至千件以上，粵稽帝堯，明目達聰，爲天下謳歌訟獄所歸，良不過是。何以故？由前之言，民若曰，「有一人在，吾屬何患？」民情所感，莫之爲而自致故。</p>
<p>雖然，主，席究何以致是？憶在重慶困阨時，敵機晝夜連襲，年至九十餘次，形勢岌岌不可終日。有識微君子號於衆曰：「子無恐！將委員長之挺勁大，決能挺至戰勝爲止」。已而果然。挺之時義，其大如此！曾文正昔在祁門，守土如彈丸，而四周皆敵，救援不至，顧文正吸水烟下棋，講學治文書如平時。嘗爲人論述一生成功之要，公掀髯曰：「吾何知？惟有秘本挺經十八章，今猶用之未盡耳」。李鴻章爲門生長，曾懇懇乘間請經。文正爲講開宗明義第一章。事爲一老翁遣子入市買菜，而久不至。翁怪而偵之，則見其子與一貨擔者相持於水塍間，兩不得過，以彼此皆不肯下水讓道也。翁　指貨擔者挺而言曰：「來！以若擔付我，我請下水，戴之頭上，不濡爾貨，俟爾趨而過，再荷去，何如？」且語且傴僂，作解履狀。其人遜謝，困乃解。此挺經首章跡府也。鴻章意得甚，請益。文正笑曰：「得此受用不盡，何以　爲？」以是曾氏之挺經失傳，而通其意者亦絕罕。獨蔣公平生好挺，其用挺術，自以八年苦戰爲最大。至邇者南北之民，流離怨嗟，勢　　且不可制，而主席一輕車周轉間，囂者帖然以戢，行無所事，挺術之支流餘裔，而績效之神妙已若是。聞主席服膺文正，諒兩賢相契，有嘿喻於隱微者已。</p>
<p>嘗論政以有輔而成，功緣稍縱以逝。蚩蚩者氓，愛戴主席如今日者，亦云至矣，倘無以永其迹相，延其內感，則載舟者水，覆舟其亦非他。今天下之患，在於政出多門，日趨叢脞。一方主史，何止三公，一事之起，人人有責，又似人人無責，甚至利在則相爭，患　則相諉，冥冥墮壞，不知凡幾。如此種種，民自相告語，有一人在，吾屬何息者，久之而　所表見，亦殊不足以壹民志而端政趨。</p>
<p>竊　爲今之計，救今之蔽，蓋不外循名覈實信賞必罰八字。意此看千餘通陳訴狀中，當不無端　犂然足成信讞之件，倘從　淸釐，訊歸大吏，原本殫洽，天下咸知，此大之以著憲政之規模，小之以通民　之隱曲，轉移間，國事其不煥然改觀，日臻上理者，吾滋未信。英倫以憲政祖國稱，究之憲章概無成文，其初類無不由各別案件，依判例歸納而得，所　　CaseMade　Law　者是也。凡自由準是獲來，較之空文著錄，曠蕩無歸者，遙爲深切著明。今之談憲法者，兢兢於比較，逐逐於通論，而忘却眼前大事，不汲汲於從例得比，由別觀通，君子不智大，無過於茲。因於迎將主席篇中，連類書之。</p>
<h3>被共軍所俘美飛行員　受難始末記　經過三十八天磨難脫險津</h3>
<p>〔聯會社天津十九日電〕美軍航空隊員六人，十一月十日於大雪紛飛時，墮落北平南方二百七十里某村，爲中共軍所執經過三十八天之購難，今日已出險，返抵此間彼等雖然　　滿　，但顯然身體健旺，未受影響。　在十一月十日那天，他們從北平駕駛一架魚當轟炸機，向天津飛去，途遇惡劣氣候，進退失據，被迫在河靑村附近田野中降落。他們在田間降落後，農夫起光不加理睬，但後來來了幾個共軍士兵，用槍指着他們，把他們押到附近村落，就在那裏變成俘虜，荷爾白羅克中尉，向中共軍首領請求釋放。首領回答說，這是「政治問題」，須經由正常途徑處理。他們等候美機飛來找尋，但每次飛機飛過，共軍必謁力把他們隱藏起來，不使天空機中人者到。</p>
<p>共軍首領不斷對他們說，他們並非俘虜。但荷爾白羅克中尉就說「這些人坐在四週橫着槍對着我們，這情景不知道你呌做什麼？」共軍不斷的想把他們主義，向這六個美國人宣傳，有好幾次，他們向荷爾白羅克中尉及另外一個航空員，是否願意寫一些東西，稱讀共軍和他們的首領，說他們　　十分優厚。但是兩人都加以拒絕。他們又嘗請各人端坐，以便照個相片，留作紀念，也被拒絕。有幾個共軍士兵，告訴美國航空員說：美國飛機正在攻擊他們的村莊，並說共革和美軍已發生衝突。有一個士兵竟乾脆的說，「共軍已和美軍開戰了。」</p>
<p>共軍把飛機隱蔽起來，荷爾白羅克中射和一個伙伴跑到飛機裏。設法將機上設備竭力加以破壞。那個伙伴把電池扭通，讓電流流罄，飛機上的喇叭，就發出巨嚮。共軍士兵大駭，就拿槍抵住他，問他在做些什慶。同時荷爾白羅克在後機座，盡量把各物破壞，也時時被槍抵着。後來六個人都被移至仁求村，關在柵欄裏，外面由衛兵守住。</p>
<p>最後在十一月二十五日，他們決定逃走，　還　掩護，爬出　　，走到一處湖澤地方。那一天，穿着田野步行，大的走了一百十餘里路，到下午天色將暮的時候，才差兩個人，進入一個村莊，去找一些水和食物。他們找到了水，但沒有盒物，預備回到同伴藏身的地方，一起會合。忽然來了一批軍民，向他們兩人撲來，他們盡力應　，有一個在肩上被槍柄敲着一下，他們沒命的逃，兵士意圖阻止，緊追着開了幾槍。四個藏匿着同伴，看看二人危急，快被捉住，就出來援救，這批中國軍民，見又來了四個美國人，就轉身向村裏退去。</p>
<p>六個人乃　讀步行，直到深夜，走到一處十字交又的沼澤地方，無法渡過。最後雖然渡過了，但天一亮就被共軍看見，又重作俘虜。這批士兵把他們的　。結婚戒指。打火盒和其他隨身用具，統統搜括而去，但第二天共軍軍管却把大部份東西歸還了他們，但夜間在草棚棚裏，時時被共軍士兵用古老的手溜彈和來福槍敲他們的脛骨，把他們弄醒。</p>
<p>有一次，共軍把他們用牛車送到新建村，嗣又送回河靑村，那邊的共軍極加優待，給他們吃很好的飯食。共軍想呌這些美國人穿十八路軍制服，但他們只着上袴子，別的一概不穿。共軍首領所以不厭其煩的要他們穿共軍制服，大槪是想呌別人相信，他們已經加入共產黨了。</p>
<p>幾天後，共軍首領告訴他們說，可以回去了。把他們送到新建村，共軍才退了回去，說前面共軍正和中央軍大戰。美機在早幾天曾丟下一些冬衣，由中共軍拾到，都拿來給他們，各人就儘址穿上，餘下來的，就送給共軍，以報答他們的好飯食。這是被俘後的第三十五天。他們重向友軍陣綫進發，的距中央軍所在地廿里，在那裏有兩個美國軍官在等候他們，終於把他們平安送回天津。到津後，立刻檢查身體，則雖受磨折，幸未損害。當六個人去見洛基將軍報告的時候，洛基面呈喜色說：「這是我最難得的聖誕禮物」。</p>
<p>蔣主席在平檢閱美整三水陸兩棲部隊第三聯隊。傍立者爲美水陸兩棲部隊司令洛克將軍及第十一戰區司令長官孫連仲將軍。</p>

<h3>六十支紗　原料匱乏</h3>

<h3>股份有限公司　新舊公司法比較</h3>
<p>— 鼐聲</p>
<p>爲適應現代經濟潮流，國民政府對公司法已改正重訂，現行公司法與前訂公司法有許多不同之點，上海爲全國商業總匯，商人對公司法允須寄予極大之注意，本人僅就其最重要部份，股份有限公司一章，列舉新舊公司法相異點如下：</p>
<p>一設立　舊公司法規定股份有限公司應有七人以上爲發起人，現行新法則規定五人以上即够，惟發起人中半數必須居住中國，新法中更允許外人，無論居住中國與吾，俱能參加中國公司</p>
<p>二股份　舊公司法規定股份有限公司之資本應分爲股份，每股金額應歸一律，不得少於二十元，新法則無票而最高額之規定，　法公司得發行無記名股票，但其股數不得超過股份總數三分之一，新法則規定無記名股票得發行至二分之一，舊法公司設立時，祗准發行一種股票，除非爲增資或發行公司　時，得有優先股產生，但新法中，優先股與普通股在公司開始設立時得同時發行。</p>
<p>三股東會　舊公司法規定公司各股東每股有一表決權，一股東而有十一股以上者，應以章程限制其表決權，但每股東之表決權，及其代理他股東行使之表決權合計不得超過全體股東表決權五分之一。但在新法中，除非章程另訂外，無此規定。</p>
<p>四董事　舊公司法規定公司董事至少五人，由股東會就股東中選任之，新法中減至三人，惟董事二分之一必須居於中國，如董事會而有主席者，其主席必須爲居於中國之中國人。</p>
<p>五經理　舊公司法無對經理之詳細條文，新法中則規定經理，副經理等之選任及解任必須多數董事議決，對其酬勞亦用同樣方法。新法中更對經理等之責權亦有明確之規定。</p>
<p>六公司債　舊公司法中公司發行公司債之總額不得逾已繳股款之總額，如公司現存財產少於已繳股款之總額時，不得逾現存財產之額，新法中則規定公司債不得超過該公司資產除負債所剩餘之總數。</p>
<p>七增資　舊公司法規定公司添募新股時，應先儘舊股東分認，如有餘額，始得另募，新法中雖仍其舊，但舊股東認購之新股以不超過原有比例爲原則，例如某甲在其公司中有五分之一股票，則當該公司增資時，某甲所認新股最多不得超於五分之一。</p>
<p>八解散　舊公司法規定公司之解散必須由股東過半數代表股份總數過半數者之出席，以出席股東表決權三分之二以上之同意行之，新法中則必須有能代表四分之三股份之股東出席始行之　以上八點，是比較顯著之異點，而在現行公司法中，更有一特別不同於舊法者，則爲對管理外國在華公司之條文，當此戰後建設期間，中國所需外資甚巨，而盟邦亦願投資於中國，故現行公司法中設有專條，管理此事，惟此類條文，乃舊公司法中之所無也。</p>

<p>永盛—英南（盃部）六時一刻</p>
<p>鷲隊—晨黃（盃部）七時正</p>
<p>晨組—培爾（晨部）七時三刻</p>
<h3>建國敎育</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>如果我們不否認敎育是應該適應國家需要，負起時代使命的，那末今後的敎育，就該向建國的大道邁進。在抗戰時期，我們努力於戰時敎育（或稱非常時期敎育，國難敎育，國防敎育，民族敎育，……），助成了抗戰的勝利。勝利以後，我們應常致力建國敎育，以達成建國的最大目的。</p>
<p>建國敎育應當怎樣實施呢？可以從下列幾點着手：</p>
<p>（一）學校敎育與社會敎育的並進我國目前不僅有許多學齡兒童失學，而且有更多的不識字的成人。如果這些文盲不掃除，國家的建設無由實現。掃除文盲，當然要普及敎育，盡量添辦學校，强迫兒童入學，同時廣設民衆學校，實施成人補習敎育。這樣兒童與成人兼顧，學校敎育與社會敎育並進，才能奏效。</p>
<p>（二）知識灌輸與體格鍛鍊的兼顧向來敎育只偏於知識的傳授，而忽略了身體的健康，結果造成了一班文弱書生。今後國民敎育的實施，應常力謀兒童身心兩方的健全發展，使知與力的均衡和協調。</p>
<p>（二）生產技能與科學知識的合一根據兒童的身體健康的原則，實施生產的勞作，從生產勞作上研究社會，自然的科學。這樣所得到的技能是生產的，知識是科學的。以科學的知識改良生產的技能，從生產的工作促巡科學的探討。</p>
<p>（四）集團訓練與德性培養的聯繫國民敎育，允須注意於團體活動的組織和運用的能力，使兒童從羣的集體中培養其個體的德性。一方面可養成優良的品行，一方面養成成年時參加政治組織的團結能力。</p>
<h3>主席愛護學生　免費供糧</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕主席對平市學生，備極愛護。平市大中學校住宿生，因籍隸外縣，交通梗阻，經濟來源斷絕，伙食無法維持，行營李主任前曾批令糧食部特派員價發各校住宿生一個月食糧，惟中央規定，因收復區豁免田賦，各機關學校食糧應自行籌購，如係撥糧，亦須繳價。主席蒞平，爲體恤學生食糧困難，特批飭免費撥供雜糧，以資救濟。糧食部特派員奉令後，即通知各校備册領糧，十七日十八日兩日大致領撥完竣，各校學生對於主席愛護德意，深爲感激。</p>

<p>民生公司民權輪，前（十七日）晨，與江順輪同時出口，駛往宜昌，是日適因風大，江順船大未受影響，繼續上駛，民權輪船小，不敢急進，當晚十二峙許，（十八最）至南通附近，領江水道不熟，駛人淺灘，遂遭擱淺。旋即電滬報告。該輪於十八日午，漲潮時，曾一度可駛，不料落水後，仍遭擱淺。公司已預備拖輪，今晨前往拖拽，一方仍希該輪自行駛離淺灘。又悉該輪，此次駛宜，僅裝汽油一千桶，乘客亦祗五十一人，並無商貨，該公司民裕輪，昨已修竣，移泊外灘三號碼頭停泊，定明日或星期六晨，自滬直駛重慶。</p>

<h3>地政局陳局長談　土地登記意義　遵照中央規定徵收費用</h3>
<p>上海市地政局爲舉辦土地登記，及中央規定　收契稅費用，並使本市各界充分明瞭該局一般工作情况起見，爰於前日（十八日）下午三時，柬邀會計師，律師代表，各地產商，各報社記者，二百餘人，舉行茶會。由陳局長石泉親自主持，略謂：</p>
<p>「今天承各位惠臨，非常榮幸。地政局自展開工作以來，將近三月，關於土地事宜，及市民應予注意各點，擬向各位作一綜合報告，希在座各位，不吝指敎。　抗戰八年問，本市地政，經敵偽非法處分，地籍紊亂，契據遺失，產權發生問題，尤其盟邦人士產業，所有英法册道契，改八日册者甚多。收復以後，本局根據中央頒布地權淸理辦法加以整理。並定三大工作方針：（一）採取和平公允態度進行辦理；（二）遵照中央規定，處理以前租界部份合法產權，（三）根據互惠條約，以公正立場，調整盟邦畸形地權之斜紛。</p>
<p>展開土地　測丈登記</p>
<p>至於黃浦區（即前公共租界工部局法公　局）所有未辦登記方單，舊道契，年代久遠，本局已出動測址工作人員二十二班，分別測丈詳細繪圖。發現道契中，畝分常有參差出入之處，故淸丈繪圖登記工作，極爲重要。此次辦理土地登記意義有二：（一）在人民方面依法聲請登記後，換發土地所有權狀，人民　權，有絕對效力，予以保障。且該項產證，並附有詳細地圖，對業主便利不少。（二）政府方面，則有完備之簿册，經整個登記後，淸查便利，對土地行政推行，極有裨益。</p>
<p>主席在雙十節昭告國人，其中一點，即爲土地淸丈，及財富登記，故土地登記工作，乃爲調查財富之必經程序，亦即財富登記之一種，應加緊辦理。</p>
<p>登記區域　劃分三處</p>
<p>至於登記範圍，計分三登記處，先辦六區，計：黃浦區，（包括舊公共租界部份，舊法租界部份）閘北區，引翔區，漕涇區，滬南區，法華區。爲一般業戶登記便利起見，除總局外，設立登記分處三處：（一）乍浦路六十六號，第一登記處，辦理舊特一區（黃浦），閘北，引翔區登記事宜；（二）大西路七十一號第二登記處，辦理舊特二區（黃浦）法華區，登記事宜；（三）南市尚文路七十二號第三登記處，辦理滬南，漕涇區登記事宜。</p>
<p>希望市民踴躍前往登記，因等一次登記較爲繁複，求其詳盡起見，以二個月爲登記收件時間，即自十一月十九日開始，至一月十八日截止，平均六區內土地計二十二萬畝，至少有三十萬戶，登記截止後，再以二個月爲公告時期，俾業主於登記後，他人有異議時，得予依法更正。在公告期間，亦可通融辦理登記，惟須納遲延登記費。業主寄旅他鄉，不古趕辦登記者，可陳述正常理由，予以補行登記。查二十六年前所發土地執業證，而無糾紛者，即可來局調換，當求其簡化正捷，總之非屬特殊情形，決儘速辦理，請各界不必懷疑，此乃爲必經之過程，特爲聲明。</p>
<p>敵僞發證　一律無效</p>
<p>凡本市淪陷期內，敵僞組織所爲土地權利登記，及其所給之土地權利證件，一律無效；惟各界自由　買，如屬正當交易，其產證仍認爲有效，如用强暴脅迫行爲，政府爲保障人民合法權益，次予充分保障。</p>
<p>外商道　換日册，或移轉買賣者，當依法保障，予以糾正發還。至如國人自有產證，用洋商出面，執有權柄單者，一切關於土地整理事件，本局根據中央法令，實施土地所有權登記，中外一律，其土地所有權狀，予以有效，陸續田局發給。</p>
<p>關於調換土地所有權狀，經業主向登記處聲請登記後，再予發還。現在第一期所有六區測量，已大部完成，辦理移轉變更，故較容易。六區以外，第一期登記，時問恐有不及，俟六區辦理後，再公告通知。然人民移轉變更，隨時仍可向總局辦理。六區以外產證遺失，隨時可來總局申請，尚有經界不淸案件，均將次第予以淸丈補圖。</p>
<p>處理敵僞　圈用土地</p>
<p>敵僞　用土地，如江灣·大塲·吳淞·龍華·一帶土地，凡屬强佔未出代價，而我中央政府並無實際需要者，即可公平發還。凡過去民間農塲等，決儘量設法發還，此事本人已與上海區敵僞產業處理局談過，即可辦到。關於登記費用，江蘇省過去在田賦帶征，測量費用，田賦不負責任；然緩國印刷等費，相當龐大，在此財政困難時，希望市民爲自身產權予以協助。至收費標準，凡聲請爲第一次土地所有權狀登記者，照申報地價收取千分之四，凡　請土地權利取得設定轉移變更消滅之登記，一律按照權利價値收取千分之二。騐契契稅比較高，自百分之六到百分之十五。此項收入，悉歸國庫，由局代徵代解。依土地法一般原則，土地整理登記以後，可不必再付契稅，此點亦極重要，希各界注意。</p>
<p>自由申報　登記地價</p>
<p>本局對於土地增值稅，希望業主申報地價時不要太低，五年後如無買賣，始再重估。此項增値稅，係都市繁榮自然趨勢，非人民勞力獲得，亦即含有平均地權之意義在內，故政府抽稅相當高。如現在申報地價，每畝二百萬，十五年後地價增爲三百萬，即地價漲百分之五十，政府抽以百分之二十之增値稅，故業土由報地價低，十五年後地價高漲，抽稅自大，即要吃虧。反之，如地產售價超過申報價値，亦須抽稅，惟增値稅費，由買主負擔，希望業主對地値估價，能在水平綫上，自由申報。同時本局並依據三十年法公董局，及工部局僞組織所佔地價册，採爲參考資料。</p>
<p>查月前各登記處辦理土地登記，每天每處不過二百戶，照估計有三十萬戶，如此似太迂緩，希業主從速登記，勿存觀望。總之本局在極複中。積極爲人民服務，人民來局看卷抄卷，一槪免費，各登記處決予以極大便利，如有問訊，儘量解答，經界不淸，要求丈量時，職員態度不好，或有舞弊情事，人民可檢舉告發；一經查實，決予嚴懲。各位如有高見，口頭書面均可，本人極願接受」云云。</p>
<p>旋各界代表相繼提出關於登記覓保，納稅諸問題，經陳局長一一解答，討論極爲熱烈，至六時始散。</p>
<h3>遷川工廠在滬開會　籲請政府救濟</h3>
<p>（本報訊）遷川桂工廠聯合會駐滬辦事處於昨日下午三時，在東熙華德路該處召集該會到滬會員六十二單位開會，並請葉鈕二宣慰使蒞會，有所陳請。葉宣慰使因公未到，鈕宣慰使惕生則由該會代表參政員薛明劍伴同到會。出席者有該會到滬單位代表劉鴻生顏燿秋周錦水等及各報記者共七十餘人。會塲空氣慷慨熱烈，而於各代表之演設中，更可知內地各工廠目前實况，爰將經過情形略誌於次：</p>
<p>請求七點</p>
<p>首由該會主席顏燿秋向鈕宣慰使提出請求七點，盼能轉呈中央，其內容爲：（一）迅予分配敵僞工廠，以利生產；（二）實行低利貸款；（三）墊　賠款以助復工，因戰時內遷工廠損失極重，如華成電器廠於去歲湘桂大戰期中，損失違法幣八十九萬萬元之鉅，此項損失，雖日後自可向敵索賠，但目前亟應先由政府代墊此項賠款之一部，以資週轉，而勵忠貞。（四）請援農民豁免田賦一年之例，准予免稅一年。（五）請資助後方技術員工來滬復工，因目前由渝來滬之黑市船票，　已售至法幣四十萬元之駭人鉅價，按術員工，皆已無法可來。（六）內地工廠之機器，有一部份仍可應用，請政府資助遷運。（七）請健全廠方行政，保障安分工友。該項請求，並由該會來滬會員連署後，書而向鈕宣慰使提出。</p>
<p>工廠難苦</p>
<p>繼由各會員分別發表意見，而以華成電器廠周錦水之言最爲沉痛，全塲動容。周氏略謂華或自滬內遷時，有機器千餘噸，湘桂戰時，祇剩八百七十五噸，至柳州後，黔桂路斷無法遷運，工人死二十二人，失踪六人，而對此剩餘之物資，乃至祗得自行破壞，且請盟軍代爲炸毀。周氏一行跋涉至渝後，經濟部借予七千五百萬元，囑令復工，不意復工之後，勝利來臨，政府不再向各廠定貨，工廠祗得停工，華成亦非例外，全部損失達法幣八十九萬萬元，個人即全部破產，猶未能償還政府之債，而政府債款之利息，亦達三分四釐，長此以往，彼且將以負債入獄，彼之唯一希望爲「請將愛國的和不愛國的分一分淸楚。」吳羹梅謂內遷之時，各廠從未計較成敗利鈍。又謂外匯率未定，標賣之價格如何可定，彼等之希望爲能代營各敵僞工廠。劉鴻生亦謂標賣辦法，祗有供給上海發國難財之商人以新的發財機會。並謂上海工廠停業三月，失業工人二十萬，損失奇鉅。</p>
<p>鈕氏表示</p>
<p>鈕宣慰使繼即起立致詞，深表同情，謂因勝利突然而來，一切皆極倉卒，人手不足，遂不免有未能令人滿意之事實。「人民之損失不盡，政府之痛苦亦不盡。」政府不特欲收復人心，亦欲知民間疾苦，正欲各方暢所欲言，俾將來除憲草外，更可因而訂定政綱政策，並請大家書面提出，作爲宣慰使報告之「證明書」。最後薛明劍謂「人民決不與國爭利，但政府亦必須明明白白」。散會時已六時許矣。</p>
<h3>國際電台收發　中法直達電報</h3>
<p>交通界訊，交通部國際電台在滬復業，經先後開放中美、中英、中瑞、滬港、滬澳、等直達國際無線電路，及中美、中菲新聞電路。該台近爲便利中法通訊起見，復自本月十九日起，增開中法直達國際無線電路，每日晝夜用高速度自動機。與法都巴黎通報，暢捷無比。各界交發電報，可逕送福州路七十號國際電台營業處拍發</p>
<h3>擬定新匯率　尙在研究中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報記者爲外傳外匯率即將公佈一事，昨特走訪中央銀行某負責當局。據稱：新外滙率之規定，旣不能過低，以免國內工商業遭受影響，然又不能過高。且新滙兌率之規定，務必顧全國內經濟情形，視各地鈔劵發行狀况，物價情形，再配合世界各國之經濟趨勢，作綜合之調查研究後，方能作最後之決定。渠深信政府負責當局，刻正積極研究中，其遲遲未能公佈者，亦足證問題過於繁複，非經審愼研究，多方統籌並劃，實不能定一面面俱到之新外滙率也。</p>
<h3>善後救濟總督　設新聞委員會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國善後救濟總署，行政院善後救濟總署及上海分署等三機構，鋻於各該署等發表新聞，時有界限不淸，及技術方面之未能盡善。爰決定設立聯合新聞委員會，統籌新聞發佈事宜。於每星期三六開會二次，委員三人，聯合國善後救濟總署派定馬克阿勒司脫，行政院善後救濟總署派定沈維泰，上海分署派定王人　，由沈維泰任主任委員，上海分署新聞科長顧樑兼任委員會秘書。</p>

<h3>無綫電登記　展期截止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市無綫電，無綫電台，及無綫電器材登記，經淞滬警備司令部佈告限於本月底截止。惟因該部電信監察科地位狹窄，且工作人負不敷分配，現已決定展期，待另覓新址後，再行決定截止期。</p>

<h3>參觀德僑集中營　被拘禁納粹黨徒的生活一斑</h3>
<p>— 邁天</p>
<p>走上江灣其美路，你會忘記二十分鐘前所看見的高樓大厦；馬路上擠和亂的情形。其美路兩旁，田野廣闊，沒有房子，沒有擺　，連人的影子也很少。遠遠的，你可以看見前面左邊有一宅巨大的自色樓房，那就是現在德僑的集中營，以前是日本的國民小學校，接連着的四幢大樓，其中一幢現在就是給二百個希特勒的信徒們住着。</p>
<p>拘禁着的二百個德僑中，有男八十九人，女四十八人，及兒童六十三人。他們自己組有一委員會，由五人組織，負責自己的伙食衣住等生活。會長倫道，那是納　黨的聽兒腦兒中的一份子，以前曾當德領事館的顧問。</p>
<p>全上海的德人利計二千三百人，德僑管理委員會將他們分成三類：（一）政府人員，包括外交官，宣傳入員，重要納粹黨員等。（二）商務人員，包括洋行職員，技術人員等。（三）居留人民，包括敎士·敎　·醫士·律師·等，及自由職業者及住戶。現在被嗣在集中營中的即屬第一類，及第二三類中之篇隷納粹，或曾在敵僞時代有不利於聯合國之行爲者。其餘的德人，通飭一律取具保證後，暫留市內，德僑管理委員會，已商得楊樹浦聖心醫院的同意，不久將再令二百個生活此較困苦的德人集中在那邊。</p>
<p>至於德國人的財產·房屋·傢俱，有一部份已由該德人產主·承借人，及德僑管理委員會，會同簽字後，供給本市政府機關應用。</p>
<p>固執的老納粹</p>
<p>集中營之工地上，德國人自巴出資蓋了所廚房，據說那是一個多月前他們化了好幾十萬法幣蓋成的。裏面相當寬大，四點鐘光景，他們已在準備晚餐，十妙個男女德人，圍了一圈在削洋芋皮，其中有一個戴鴨舌帽，穿皮甲克，又高又大的老頭兒，他就是拉門—中國區內納粹的首領。這個受過希特勒主義多年薰陶的老滑頭，非常固執，不肯隨隨便便告訴記者們一句有關的話。記者問他的家庭在那裏，他說：〔我沒有家庭」。除了拉門外，共中還有好幾個曾喧赫一時的納粹份子，像埃哈脫，前上海的納粹領袖；米納脫，前聖的翰大學的敎授；柯德，前上海德國情報組組長；美最時，前上海海通社社長；陶斯德，前寳隆醫院院長；何勃，前德大使館的一個重要份子　二樓前日本小學的敎室，現在有二十一間劃出給他們住。每間房分成數間，每一家人家都的有二丈長一丈闊的地方，用布圍成一小間。裏面陳設得相當舒服，放二只小床，二只小孩床，少數傢具外，還不算太擠。據說他們組織很好，吃飯是在一起吃的，每個月每人的用伙食費五元美金。洗衣服，整理房間都自己動手。幾個德國男人還拿了斧頭，在草地上大劈樹根。他們並沒有什麼娛樂的組織，平時最多下下棋。他們每天規定七時起身，八時用早點，九時點名，十二時中餐。六時晚餐，七時再點名，九時入睡。九時後即不得出室外。不准賭博，或吵架鬧事等。點名時，由德僑管理委員會負責，所有男子須至辦公處簽名，女子及兒童，暫時不舉行點名。</p>
<p>無辜的孩子們</p>
<p>關於醫病方面，有德國白克蘭牙醫生，及海門醫生，每星期前去二次診治。</p>
<p>德僑管理委員會現有七人，在營中管理一切，警衛司令部並派有二十名衛兵防守。</p>
<p>這些納粹的黨徒們，雖然是失去了自由，可是以他們的罪行來講，他們自認營中的待遇很好，要如拿軸心國的慘無人道的「魔窟」來比，那是不可同日而語的了。</p>
<p>離營前，看見幾個德國孩子們在場巾遊戲，有兩個極可愛的小女孩子，坐在石合上對我們憨笑。我想，她們也許爲自己突然的被送到那麼荒凉的地方來，會感到莫明其妙。失去了以前有趣的玩具，和熱鬧的去處。她們會不會知道是誰的恩賜呢？我爲那些孩子們呌寃。</p>
<p>其美路日本國本小學校，現在已給德僑們作爲集中營。這些希特勒的黨徒，納粹主義的執行者，雖然失却自由，而仍得度着中人階級以上的日常生活。被禁着的德僑男子，在庭院裏操作，倒也精神抖擻，顯着舒適安閒的樣子呢。</p>

<h3>數千年種子發芽</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>最近報載：蘇聯赤爾湖區及伏洛格達州從事發掘工作的「考古遠征隊」在莫洛德那河，發現苧麻種子四顆，經多數專家精密考察，證明已埋地數千年，近來才萌芽抽枝，蘇聯科學家將設法自此等種子培植新種子。</p>
<p>這好像是科學上的奇蹟，數千年前的種子，埋在地下，會在數千年後的今日發芽抽枝。經過這樣一個悠久的年代，地層也不知有過多少變化，而那當初種下的種子，並沒有隨遠古的歲月而湮沒。我想，最初播種的那個人，怕自已的骨骸也早腐爛成泥土了，他何嘗想到數千年以後還會被考古工作者發現呢？</p>
<p>英國大思想家斯賓塞（Spencer）曾說過：「一粒石子，可以改變地球」。這就是說，別看輕了一粒石子之微，因爲一粒石子總是一種「物質」，而「物質」無論大小都可以改變世界的。物理學家所謂「物質不滅」，也正說明了任何一種「物質」總能在它所佔有的空間裏發生種種變化，而這種種變化，就會對我們的世界人類有各種不同的影響，試看原子·電子在今日人類生活中的重要，便不難知道「物質不滅」的道理。</p>
<p>數千年的種子可以發芽抽枝，據蘇聯最高科學研究院的植物學家·化學家綜合的研討，諷爲並非宇宙的奇蹟，過去也有不少學者研究過這問題，結論是百分之七三·六的可能，以後繼續研究，也許還可以增加可能的百分數。再拿「物質不滅」的原則來解釋，數千年前種下的種子，當然儘可能在以後的若干年發芽抽枝，雖然數千年道個很長久的年代有時不免令我們驚訝。</p>
<p>從這件事實，我們可以得到兩個很大的啓示：一個就是我們人類在這個廣漠的世界，別看輕了自己個人的力量。個人的力量雖小，但可以影響整個世界，關涉整個的人類部是事實。最初播下的一粒種子，在地層經過若干年的變遷和演北，牠可以留給後人作培植新種子之用，同時可以使人追溯到遠古的一個荒漠的時代，而發生「歷史是演進的」，「歷史的發展是積累的」這兩種觀念和感覺。我想一個革命家在當初所散佈的一些些革命思想，那怕就是一點一滴的，到後來也會融匯成革命的主流，而追溯先人所散佈的一些些革命思想，却覺得有永遠不朽的功績，即使在當時影饗很小，但社會實在就靠了它無形中在變化，正如數千年的種子在地下慢慢滋長一樣。</p>
<p>一個人生活在世界上，不過數十寒署，「小我」的存生和連續，一定要靠「大我」的力量。換句話說，我們不是爲個人而生存，而是爲社會爲整個的人類而生存。我們要希望「小我」不朽，就只有擴張「小我」爲「大我」。我們應該多替別人想想，不要僅顧自身一己的利益，自己有多少力量，就該貢獻出來，對於別人有利益的，必須盡心盡力去做，而且我們的工作態度，還要超越「自私自利」不計以後的報　，不求他人的讚譽。要抱定「有一分力做一分事，有一分熱發一分光」的觀念。不能做怎樣轟轟烈烈的大事業，也該學那數千年前的播種者，種下種子留着後人培植新種子，永遠綿續而不斷，該科學家多得一些可貴的研究資料。我們古老的中國，一向流行「前人栽樹後人乘凉」的諺語，就正面說這是很對的，可惜這句話現在早已成爲一種譏諷，敎人學「乖」，敎人「不要多事」，敎人「只爲自己打算」。這種不良的生活　度如果不亟早消除，即個人在世界上活到數百年數千年，也還是要隨自已的尸骸而腐朽的。如果我們要希望我們的「精神」不與尸骸同腐，那還是將「小我」的人生觀，擴充而爲「大我」的人生觀。</p>
<p>第二個啓示是；歷史是一面鏡子，誰都不能違背歷史約定例。種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，因果律不容人們隨便倒置。柏克萊說：「從一粒沙土看一個世界」，沙土雖微，但它對於造成一個世界的影響和變化却是一定的，不變的。八年前的東西兩個侵略魁首，他們今日所受的惡果，正是他們所造的「惡因」而成，他們現在不再敢在正義面前爲非作歹了，他們已經在歷史的鏡子前低首屈膝了，這是他們應得的譴責和懲誡。</p>
<p>前面說過，我們別小視了我們個人的力量，我們的力量雖小，但由「小我」而擴充爲「大我」，便很足以影響我們的世界。同時我們還得倍加珍重，我們的每一種行爲都能予以後的人類和社會以很大的影響。胡適之先生在一篇文章裏，說一個人因爲偶不小心在路上吐了一口痰，而這口痰中藏着無數的肺病菌，因此輾轉傳染，把全城的居民都造成肺病患者。這話看來好像不像事實，實際上倒是極可能的事。蘇聯最近發現的那四顆種子，如果能慢慢地培成新種子，那麼苧蔴的繁殖率將永遠不會减低。我們的民族，在建國過程中，也正需要無數人超越「自私自利」的觀念，爲後代的國民，播下發揮民族的光與熱的種子。數十年後，數百年後，數千年後我們的後人可以享受無窮的幸福，這該是何等有意義的事！</p>

<h3>遼寗主席徐箴先生</h3>
<p>— 雪濤</p>
<p>由於東北局勢的好轉，中央派往接收遼寗的省政府主席徐箴先生，也於前幾天乘機北上了。</p>
<p>在接收東北的大員中，除外交專員蔣經國先生外，省政府主席徐箴先生的年齡也是屬於年輕的一個。他今年還只四十開外，却已負担起一省首長的重任。這在全國省主席中也是難能可貴的</p>
<p>說起這位徐箴先生，想大家對他都不會怎樣陌生，因爲他在浙江第六區當過行政督察專員，後來又擢升爲隣省福建的敎育廳長，自日本投降後，他又一躍而爲遼寗省的主席了。在這短短的幾年中，他由專員而廳長，由廳長而省主席，可稱得上是「飛黃騰達」的紅人。不過這其間絕沒有僥倖的機會存乎其中，因爲這種跳躍式的晉升，次不是　等求進的人所能望其項背的。不信，且看看他的一段歷史：</p>
<p>徐先生是遼寗瀋陽人，民國二十年，他在哈爾濱還是充任市電報局長。「九一八」事變爆發，在東北的大小機關，大半不知下落，有的長官被捕下獄，有的主管乘機捲逃，情形之混亂，眞令人痛心。但我們這位市電報局長徐箴先生，却帶了二十萬元公款，輾轉到了南京，晉謁朱家驊部長，把公款賬目一齊交代淸楚。朱部長認爲在混亂的局面和澆薄的世風下，能發現這樣一位正人君子，殊屬不可多得，於是就帶了他去晉謁蔣主席，經蔣主席獎勉有加，後來他就被派任浙江第六區行政督察專員。第六區便是蔣主席的故鄉，在任凡八年，人民莫不稱頌其仁政。民國三十一年，他被調任爲福建敎育廳長，對閩省敎有頗多建樹，特別是國語統一運動，收到很大的效果。最近中樞以東北收復，特任徐氏爲遼寗省政府主席—這就是徐先生從政的經過。</p>
<p>從這片段簡略的歷史中，你可相像得到徐先生是怎樣一位廉潔自持，夙夜從公約長官了。這與那些專忙着發國難財，享勝利福的官員們比起來，當然是不可同日而語的。宜乎中樞要特任徐氏爲收復東北行政的新長官了。</p>
<p>徐箴先生是在十年前「九一八」時代逃亡出來的東北人，現在派他回去收復失土，那是最適常的人選了。我們希望徐先生不但爲我們收回東北已失的土地，尤其重要的，更爲我們收回東北的人心！</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>美國戰犬隊</h3>
<p>— 廷鈞</p>
<p>在這次世界大戰中，美軍曾充分的利用戰犬，這些戰犬曾救活無數的兵士，也曾建樹光榮的戰績。</p>
<p>美國軍需隊在一九四三年一年中，就訓練了四萬多頭精選的戰犬。訓練的地方一共有五處。訓練前先試騐各犬的個性特長，再就牠們適合的工作，分別加以訓練，在所有的戰犬中，其中的有百分之八十五屬於哨探攻擊隊戰犬，專訓練牠們刺探掩伏的敵人，猛施襲擊。此外是通訊戰犬，牠們要穿過密佈的電網，將消息和軍事地岡傳達到後方。巡邏戰犬，牠們的任務是在巡行前綫，或殲滅被圍的敵軍時，探出掩藏着的敵軍。救傷戰犬，她們的任務是尋出受傷的軍士，報告後方，由後方趕快派人去救護。運輪戰犬，牠們的任務是將軍火器械，由　車拖載，送往人不通通過的前綫。再有給養戰犬，牠們的任務是把水同食物用具，穿過險難的地區，送往前綫各點去。</p>
<p>在訓練時，預備作戰的軍用犬都受各式攻擊敵人的訓練，一見敵人就猛烈的撲　，衹有担任救傷和通訊的軍用犬不受攻擊訓練。救傷犬項下帶有一根特製的皮棒，發現傷兵後，牠就將棒含在口中，跑回後方，後方一見這信號，立刻派救護隊出動，跟隨着牠去尋覓傷兵。</p>
<p>每頭戰犬有一個訓練的人專管他，　練牠各種技巧，負責飼義照料牠，戰犬第一要服從主人命令，一個手勢一做，牠立刻奮不顧身猛撲敵人，另一個口號一發，牠應聲蜷伏在地下，一動都不動彈。</p>
<p>戰犬基本訓練時期普通是八個星期，訓練完畢後，有的留在國內看守兵工廠或軍事要塞，巡視沿海岸地帶，而大部分的都運往海外，派往各前綫作戰去。美軍稱之爲K-9軍戰犬軍。</p>
<p>這些戰犬在各處建的功績也很多，譬如，巡守波士頓某軍火廠的一頭戰犬，發現了一個刺探秘密的間諜，立刻將那間諜　住不放，直待守衛的兵趕來，捉住間諜，在間諜身上搜出整個毀滅工廠的計劃。西西利登陸時，有一個兵帶着戰犬前進，在岸上被機關槍火網圍困住，正危急時，戰犬突人機關槍陣地，一番惡鬥，機關槍手被咬死，其他守兵一齊投降。在北非載役中，有一次黑夜裏，一個哨兵領着一頭戰犬守騐着，戰犬忽然抖動哨兵手內牽的繩，哨兵立刻通知後方幾百碼遠第二綫的哨兵，這哨兵忙驚醒熟睡了的兵士，擊潰偸襲的敵軍，戰犬離開八百碼遠，已覺察出敵軍的動靜。在西南太平洋羣島的戰役中，那些熱帶地方森林蔽蔽，沼渾隱伏，更不易窺見敵叢的踪跡，全仗戰犬拯救。許多軍士，探出日軍的埋藏。戰术的確建下了不可磨滅的功績。</p>
<p>戰犬大多是由牠們的主人捐給軍隊的。陣亡後，陸軍部有印就的通知寄給犬主人：『閣下惠贈本部之戰犬——，已不幸陣亡，惟閣下念其殉國之壯蹟，而略減哀痛之心。』戰犬殉國的很多，最近美國軍人協會已議決，要求政府開闢公墓，用軍禮埋葬各部隊中陣亡的戰犬。</p>

<h3>死後的生產</h3>
<p>— 沈翊鵾</p>
<p>在十二月八日，美國伊利諾州洛克福地方，有一位足月的姙婦，患小兒麻痺症死去，她腹中的嬰兒，在她死後十三分鐘落地，是一個小女孩，至今仍還活着，而且健康。</p>
<p>醫生們說，這個女嬰的出世，雖太稀奇，然而她還有生存的希望。</p>
<p>這個小女孩是由軍醫克恩氏上校接生的。他說：『她是健康的，應該會正常的發育生長，除非她染上了小兒麻痺症。』</p>
<p>女小孩體重是四磅十四兩。</p>

<h3>房子搬塲</h3>
<p>— 柏華</p>
<p>美國一位專門研究搬動房屋的工程專家說：『假使你要搬場，同時又捨不得現在住的房子，你可以帶着房子一塊兒搬。祗要在下面一層房屋中安好屋樑，用起重機把它弔起來，裝到車上，車輪一動，就把房子搬走了。</p>
<p>不過這種房十搬場，不適於小建築。最好搬移醫院，敎堂，寫字間大樓，和公寓等。把這些龐大的建築，從舊的房基搬到新的基礎上，需時的六個月到一年。</p>
<p>美國南達庫塔州阿波定有一所林肯醫院，搬移到一哩半以外的新址。這所醫院是四層樓高，一百十五呎長，四十二呎寬，凈重三百噸。建築費爲十五萬美金，搬移到郊外新址共費了七萬五千——這就是說省了一半的錢。</p>
<p>有一座四層樓的公寓，因爲街道放寬的緣故，向後移了二十呎，搬動時所有的房客，仍照舊住在裏面。</p>
<p>公家建築往往搬動，以省納稅人的負擔，伊利諾州西北大學的狄邦天文台移到數百碼以外，除掉望遠銳的透鏡。多數貴重的儀器都原封不動，搬移建築可以節省金錢，保持建築傳統的情調。</p>

<h3>懸空屋頂</h3>
<p>— 星聚</p>
<p>美國的建築師新近設法造一種懸空屋頂，用鋁製成，藉氣壓原理，不用柱子支持，很穩的懸在空中。</p>
<p>將來你看球賽，或聽音樂時，抬起頭來，也許就會看到這種屋頂，雪亮的懸在空中，你不用害怕，那不會墜下來的，有空氣托住它，比任何鋼鐵的柱子都要牢。</p>
<p>屋頂是用極薄的鋁片製成的，四周的邊緣和牆壁緊密的連合攏。場內則由地下室許多風扇『打氣』，使氣壓增高。你也許要覺得奇怪：怎麼單靠氣壓，便能使屋頂懸在空中不墜下來？因爲鋁片的屋頂每方尺不過一磅半重，所以場內的氣壓衹須每方英寸面積中，此外面重百分之五磅，就可以將屋頂很穩的托住。而人們在那種氣壓中，也不會愈到一些不慣，這和暴雨初停，太陽重出時的氣壓並沒有甚麼分別。</p>
<p>據建築師精密的估計，這種懸空的屋頂，即使遇到極厲害的暴風，都不會塌墜；用這種光滑的屋頂，音饗可以調和，光線可以改善，而令人最滿意的就是，因爲沒有普通柱子支持，觀衆可以不妨礙視線，出塲時也可以減少擁擠。</p>

<p>（甲）凡疑有肺病者，不論其有無痛苦，或病象如何，均須用X光檢查。　（乙）凡患呼吸器疾病，在三星期以上而未愈者，均須用X光檢查。　（丙）凡於近年來，時常發生呼吸器疾病者，當用X光檢查。　（丁）凡醫師治療病人，若屬於呼吸器疾病者，於治療之外，同時須用X光檢查。</p>
<p>綜上所述得一定律，即凡未經X光檢查，而即行斷定其肺部爲健康者，乃爲錯誤之舉。換言之，非用X光檢查，決不能斷定病人毫無肺病，故欲行精確之肺部健康診斷，X光檢查，實爲必不可少之事，而尤以X光攝影最爲妥善。凡外觀健康，而已經患有肺病，或患有呼吸器病，而有肺病之可疑者，皆當立即用X光檢查，此舉於其個人之健康，與預防撲滅方面，所關甚鉅，希望社會人士盡量提倡，藉收撲滅肺癆之宏效。</p>

        <h1>1945.12.20</h1>
<h3>The Majestic Evergreen of Purple Mountain Remains Intact: Chairman Pays Reverent Visit to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] At 12:30 PM on the 19th, Chairman Chiang visited the mausoleum. He traveled simply and discreetly, known to very few. While gazing upon the benevolent visage of the Father of the Nation, the Chairman stood in silent contemplation for three full minutes and personally inspected every part of the mausoleum grounds. Subsequently, the Chairman also paid his respects at the cemetery of fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, visited Premier Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum at noon on the 19th, with Bureau Chief Yu Jishi in attendance. After visiting the mausoleum, they also went to the Memorial Hall for Fallen Soldiers at Lingxi Temple and Tan Yankai's tomb, where they stood in contemplation for a long time. The Chairman's car arrived at the front gate of the mausoleum, and he slowly ascended the steps, reaching the pavilion in about twenty minutes. There, he and his wife stood side by side before the statue of the Premier, presented a flower garden, and bowed their heads in silent prayer for three minutes before offering the highest salute. After the ceremony, they gazed upon the remains in solemn silence for a long time. They then entered the hall, circled the coffin once, and stepped out of the main hall, inspecting each offering before the hall. There was a massive bronze cauldron pierced by enemy artillery fire eight years ago. The Chairman immediately instructed Ma Xiang, the head of the Mausoleum Management Committee's Security Guard, to erect a plaque with an inscription to preserve the memory. Recalling that Chairman Chiang bid farewell to the mausoleum on December 8, 1937, before leaving Nanjing to lead the war of resistance in Wuhan, it has been eight years and ten days until his victorious return to pay respects at the mausoleum. The purple mountain, evergreen pines, and lush cypress trees are filled with auspicious atmosphere. The mausoleum stands majestically unharmed. The Chairman, leading all party comrades and fellow citizens nationwide in long-term, arduous struggle, has finally recovered the ancestral land and can report this to the spirit of the Premier in Heaven.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The Chairman traveled south at noon on the 18th. Originally, he intended to inspect other locations, but due to Marshall's arrival in China and the impending Political Consultative Conference, he departed from Beiping earlier than planned. The Chairman's week-long stay in Beiping has gradually brought coordination to party, government, and military work, and has revitalized the hearts of the people in North China, who were not without disappointment. After the news of the Chairman's departure from Beiping spread on the 18th, the people reluctantly bid farewell, many spontaneously lining the streets in the face of the howling north wind, waiting to see him off. As the Chairman's car passed, cheers rose to the clouds. The Chairman and his wife frequently waved back from the car, seemingly unable to bear to leave the former capital's residents.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, upon the summons of Chairman Chiang, flew to Nanjing on a special plane at 1:00 AM on the 19th, accompanied by Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Before Chairman Chiang left Beiping, he personally instructed Sun Lianzhong, Chairman of Hebei Province, to ensure that all counties and cities in Hebei Province ban drugs and opium, just as Beiping and Tianjin have done. This must be completely eliminated within three months of recovery; otherwise, the responsible local officials will be punished for dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3>Marshall Arrives in Shanghai Today; Will Not Linger Long and Will Proceed to Nanjing to Meet Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Marshal George C. Marshall, the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, is scheduled to arrive here by plane this afternoon. Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Mayor He Dequi, Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, and other Chinese and American officials are all preparing to welcome him at Jiangwan Airport. After disembarking, Marshal Marshall will inspect the honor guard sent by our New Sixth Army to welcome him at the airport, as well as the U.S. military police honor guard. The municipal government authorities have already begun preparing a grand reception for Marshal Marshall hosted by Mayor Qian, but the date and location will be decided after Marshal Marshall arrives in Shanghai. According to information from U.S. Military Headquarters, Marshal Marshall will rest at the Cathay Hotel after arriving in Shanghai and may host local news reporters on the same day. The U.S. news liaison officer is scheduled to accompany reporters to the airport to welcome him at 11:45 AM today. Marshal Marshall plans to stay in Shanghai for one or two days.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco Radio broadcast on the 19th that Chairman Chiang will fly to Shanghai tomorrow to meet with Marshal Marshall. Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness to reach a peaceful resolution with the Communist Party. At the same time, Ye Jianying, the Chief of Staff of the Communist Army currently in Chongqing, also expressed his willingness to lay down arms. News also indicates that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has flown to Nanjing to assist Chairman Chiang in receiving General Marshall. Chinese observers believe that Chairman Chiang will meet with Marshall in Nanjing and then depart at a suitable time to inspect various parts of China. Chairman Chiang and Marshall will spend several days in Nanjing before flying to Chongqing together to participate in the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Marshal George C. Marshall, the 66-year-old U.S. Special Envoy to China, is scheduled to arrive at Jiangwan Airport at 1:00 PM today. Various Chinese and American leaders here have all made arrangements to go to the airport to welcome him. Marshal Marshall will stay at the Cathay Hotel, in the room previously occupied by General Wedemeyer. The U.S. Theater Headquarters here has also prepared the only large desk in the area for Marshal Marshall's use, if he wishes. This desk was originally used by Major Weiss, the director of the U.S. War Crimes Tribunal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila Dispatch, 19th] General George C. Marshall, the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, arrived in Manila by plane this afternoon, two and a half hours earlier than scheduled. After disembarking, Marshall immediately took a car to inspect the devastated city of Manila and plans to fly to China tomorrow morning, arriving in Shanghai on the same day. Today, according to a telegram from the Chinese community, Marshall will go to Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang and then travel to Chongqing together.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Sir Mark Aitchison Young, the British Governor of the Philippines, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila at approximately 4:00 PM today. Young plans to stay in Shanghai briefly and will hold important talks with Marshal George C. Marshall and General Albert Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Today, according to sources close to the Chairman, it is expected that the Chairman will meet with Marshal Marshall in Nanjing. (Yesterday, the Chairman told a reporter that he would meet the new U.S. Ambassador to China, Marshal Marshall, during his tour of major cities in the formerly occupied areas.) Sources close to the Chairman indicate that the Chairman's reaction to President Truman's statement on China policy is quite favorable. It is said that the Chairman only read President Truman's report once while stationed in Beiping and will reread it in detail at an appropriate time. Top Chinese sources revealed that Chiang Kai-shek paid close attention to the situation in Northeast China while in Beiping. It is said that he was pleased with the "smooth progress" of the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Changchun. During his stay in Beiping, he also closely monitored various issues related to the withdrawal of the military and civilians in North China. Sources close to the Chairman emphasized the need to accelerate the withdrawal of Japanese military and civilians because U.S. ships will soon be unavailable. They hope that all Japanese troops will be withdrawn within two months, estimating that there are still 4 million Japanese remaining in China, Taiwan, northern Vietnam, and the nine provinces of Northeast China. Over one million Japanese are located between the Great Wall and Guangzhou, half of whom are military personnel.</p>
<h3>With Representatives Conference of Various Parties Imminent, Optimism Increases, High Hopes Pinned on Marshall's Arrival in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing Dispatch, 19th] According to observers here, representatives from both the Nationalists and the Communists, especially the Communist representatives, will make concessions to the limit in future peace talks. Both sides want to show U.S. Special Envoy Marshall their sincerity in seeking peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] China today is more hopeful than it was at the end of the war. Since the Nationalist army entered the nine provinces of Northeast China by land, and the vanguard approached Shenyang or has already entered the city, the optimistic trend of resolving the internal strife has arisen from this. Furthermore, with the new U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshal George C. Marshall, having departed from Washington for China, Chiang Kai-shek visiting Beiping to inspect the core of the disturbances in North China, and President Truman announcing U.S. policy, calling for a ceasefire between the Nationalists and the Communists, and a national conference of representatives from major political parties, the level of optimism has further increased. All parties are holding their breath and eagerly awaiting Marshall's arrival in China, with high expectations. The Nationalist Party certainly hopes to retain more of former Ambassador Hurley's plan, but no one knows whether the U.S. President appointed such a powerful figure as Marshal Marshall merely to implement Hurley's undeniably central government assistance plan without any changes. U.S. troops stationed in China are also very concerned about Marshall's arrival in China. Many of them deeply believe that they cannot return home if the Chinese civil war does not stop. If Marshall's visit can restore peace to China, it will remove the obstacles to the U.S. military's return home. In addition, there is something that the outside world has not paid attention to, that is, foreign businessmen are also eagerly awaiting Marshall's visit. They are all afraid that China's new company law will restrict their business, and they are deeply worried about inflation and China's uncertain post-war attitude. Now they are speculating that the United States' appointment of this great figure as the special envoy to China will seek to be more aggressive in trade with China, or to obtain a permanent leadership role.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Welcome Special Envoy Marshall</h3>
<p>President Truman's Special Envoy Marshal George C. Marshall is arriving in China to take office. This visit by the Special Envoy will surely benefit our country, will surely benefit the stability of the East Asian order, and will surely benefit world peace. The Chinese people have high expectations for Marshal Marshall's mission to China. As an outstanding military leader, he relied on his strategy to achieve glorious victory. His achievements are not only limited to his own country but also in the entire world and all of humanity. Now that the enemy has been defeated, the Marshal has honorably retired. He should have been resting in the mountains, but instead, he has taken on a new mission and traveled thousands of miles to China. We first express our heartfelt admiration to President Truman for choosing such a person as the Marshal to be his special envoy to China; and we are pleased that the Marshal has not refused to travel far to China. Marshal George C. Marshall is not only an outstanding military leader but also an outstanding diplomat, unanimously praised internationally. This visit to China will, it is believed, be able to use his outstanding military and diplomatic talents to establish indelible achievements for China, for the Far East, and for world peace.</p>
<p>Indeed, the development of the situation in China is related to the peace of the entire world. The United States has shouldered the heaviest burden in the effort to defeat the Axis powers; therefore, it also bears the heaviest burden in the reconstruction of world peace. From the fact that Truman chose such a person as the Marshal to be his special envoy to China, it can be known how much the United States cares about the development of the situation in China. In the process of clarifying the situation in China, outstanding figures with both military and diplomatic talents, like Marshal George C. Marshall, are needed. As the special envoy arrives in China for the first time, the Chinese people extend their sincere welcome.</p>
<h3>Marshall, Special Envoy: From Our Research Department</h3>
<p>When Marshall was appointed Special Envoy to China on November 27th, we used a corner of this newspaper to tell readers that Marshall was a symbol of guaranteed American security. Today, on the occasion of his arrival in China, we would like to add that he is a symbol of promoting Chinese unity and Far Eastern security.</p>
<p>Marshall has long been proven in America as the most suitable figure for military duties in a democratic political system. Whether in the Senate or the House of Representatives, whether Democrat or Republican, all place complete faith in him. Similarly, in China, whether in or out of government, whether the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, or other political parties, all have recognized him as a great force and hope. This point will be concretely proven in his future work.</p>
<p>Marshall's relationship with China and the Far East did not begin today; it should be traced back to around the time of World War I. He came to the Far East twice to study the military situation, for a total of two years. Before the war, he came as a junior officer, but he had already fully demonstrated his astonishing military talent. After the war, due to his powerful display of planning and combat capabilities, coupled with General Pershing's appreciation and high regard for him, he was promoted to a military position, enabling him to wear the brigadier general's star. In 1902, he was once stationed in the Philippines, leaving office and returning to the United States the following year. When he returned to the Philippines in 1913, he served for three years. During World War I, he voluntarily went to the Eastern Provinces (then known as the Three Eastern Provinces) to inspect the actual situation of the Russo-Japanese War battlefield. In early 1924, Marshall (then holding the rank of lieutenant colonel) came to China again, serving in the U.S. 15th Infantry Brigade, stationed in Tianjin. At that time, he seized many opportunities to travel to various parts of our country. In 1927, he served as the supervisor of the U.S. Army Chinese Language Training Class. Judging from this long history, General Marshall has come to China for the third time. Each time his qualifications are different, and his missions are different, but his success is the same. Precisely because of his past achievements, we believe that he will accomplish even more achievements in his future work.</p>
<p>Marshall's high promotion of the democratic spirit is worth emphasizing. Not only in politics, but even in the military, he reveals a lovely democratic tendency everywhere. For example, when he discussed the methods of selecting officers, he mentioned that the elements of the army should be improved, and the elements of the army lie in maintaining the excellent quality of officers at all levels, so he believes that the selection of officers should be based on democratic methods. All capable officers who are good at leadership should be given opportunities for advanced studies to cultivate good generals.</p>
<p>Especially at present, when China is not yet fully unified, and all parties expect Marshall to provide assistance, he has brought President Truman's instructions, and there must be new plans and new developments in this regard. Just as he was able to complete in two years the work that the Germans had taken ten years under military politics, he will definitely be able to help our country shorten the distance between various political parties and the National Government in a very short time. And, if there are any gaps in between, Marshall will do his best to eliminate them fundamentally, so that all political parties can truly unite around the National Government and reach a fully unified domain under the command of the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Speaking of his work attitude, Marshall has always earned the admiration of the world with his seriousness and dedication. His energy is unmatched by young officers. He cherishes time, strictly adheres to rules, and has not taken a single day off since he became Chief of Staff. If an "absent" sign is found in his office, then he must be taking his plane to inspect something, and it will never be for personal matters. Inspection flights are one of his habits. Whenever time permits, he often personally sets out for on-the-spot inspections, and he is never willing to rely solely on other people's eyes and ears to make subjective judgments. Due to this kind of life spirit and habit, we believe that this time he comes to China, he will definitely find ways to solve all the problems in front of him through deep observation, and the results will inevitably be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Marshall is taking on the job of special envoy to China at the high age of 65 this year. Some people may worry about his health. In fact, he looks as young as someone in their thirties or forties. He doesn't know what hardship or fatigue is; he only knows that work comes first. This is precisely why the United Nations respects him. In this war, he was able to cope with as many as nine theaters of war, command troops distributed across six continents, arrange the operational plans for each theater, and allocate all the necessary supplies to each theater. At the same time, he maintained close ties with the U.S. Congress, the Navy Department, the State Department, and the White House, and engaged in intimate guidance with his subordinates. Looking at his past work, he is simply what Americans call "like watching a complete, well-tuned, and powerful machine driving the work."</p>
<p>Marshall's confidentiality is shocking. He understands that to do well, one must be secretive. During Marshall's military operations, on one occasion, he moved one million people and their equipment in front of the German army within fourteen days without attracting the enemy's attention or preparations. This shows his special ability.</p>
<h3>Zhang and Chiang Fly to Beijing to Report to Chairman: Technical Matters of Taking Over Await Negotiation; The Main Reason for Delays in Air Transport by National Army is the Climate</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping, 19th Telegram] Zhang Jia'ao and Chiang Ching-kuo left Beiping by plane at 9:00 am on the 19th to report everything to the Chairman. Before leaving, Zhang told our reporter that the reason we have been slow to take over the Northeast is not purely due to diplomatic issues; we ourselves still have some problems to be solved, such as the preparation of winter clothing, which is one example. Zhang and Chiang were summoned by the Chairman's telegram and were originally scheduled to fly to Beiping to report on the 17th. At that time, due to the climate in Changchun reaching minus 20 degrees Celsius, the plane froze and could not take off, resulting in a one-day delay and failing to meet the Chairman in Beiping. According to inquiries from various sources, the principles of the Sino-Soviet negotiations have been determined, but some technical issues remain to be negotiated. Considering the lessons learned from the relocation of the Northeast Headquarters to Ping this past month, the authorities are particularly cautious about military and political takeover matters this time and have decided to proceed with the takeover only after all issues have been resolved. When Zhang Jia'ao passed through Ping last time, he denied that the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Chongqing involved the issue of Northeast industries and mines, but it is generally believed that the economic development of the Northeast is still the last remaining issue.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco Radio reported on the 19th that, according to the latest news, the Sino-Soviet negotiations have concluded. Dubing's troops can immediately dispatch "liaison teams" to the Russian military districts. Currently, the climate in Changchun is extremely cold, at minus 22 degrees Celsius, and the planes are freezing, making it impossible to start, which is the main reason for the delay in air transport by the National Army. A certain newspaper reported that the Communist Party massacred 20,000 civilians in Zhangjiakou, their "crime" being "anti-communism."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th Telegram] The head of our military delegation, Dong Yanping, held a second meeting with Lieutenant General Trotsky, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, at 3:00 pm today, and some decisions were made on military liaison issues between the two sides. The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command can dispatch liaison officers to contact the Soviet Army. Today's meeting lasted for two hours, and Huang and Te will hold a third conversation in the near future.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 19th Telegram] It is reported that the National Army will land on Huludao Island. Since the U.S. State Department issued instructions to General Wedemeyer, there is no longer any problem with the U.S. Seventh Fleet transporting the National Army northward again. Among the supplies transported to Huludao Island will be approximately 500 trucks for use in transporting after the National Army lands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 19th Telegram] Two thousand three hundred U.S. overseas troops arrived here today and were exchanged with the same number of troops in North China.</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying Talks:</h3>
<p>Communist Army Headquarters Moves to Zhangyuan</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing, 19th Telegram] Ye Jianying told reporters today: (1) The most intense battle areas between the Kuomintang and Communist armies are in Central China, North China, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Chaoyang, and other places. (4) In the past two years, the number of people captured by the U.S. Communist Army totaled 118. (3) The Communist Army Headquarters has moved from Yan'an to Zhangjiakou.</p>

<h3>U.S. President Consults Congress Yesterday: Recommends Establishing a Department of Defense; Merging the Army and Navy, Establishing Three Branches of the Air Force, and Vigorously Advocating Preparing for Everything to Cope with Atomic Warfare</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th Telegram] President Truman consulted Congress today to transform the Army and Navy departments into a single Department of Defense to demonstrate to the world that the United States is taking everything seriously and preparing for everything during this atomic warfare era. President Truman warned that future wars would break out more suddenly than past wars, and the United States would likely be the first to bear the brunt. The current merger of the Army and Navy will be the most effective step to prepare for contingencies. President Truman's extremely clear recommendation is an absolute victory for the Army Department. The recommendation includes seven points and is attached to a request for compulsory military training for young people aged 18 to 20. Since the recommendation completely aligns with the Army Department's plan, Navy Secretary Forrestal and his subordinates who oppose this plan will either submit their resignations or openly conflict with the President; otherwise, they will have to cease their opposition. President Truman requested that Congress approve the following points: (1) Establish a single Department of Defense, responsible for all national security, including all armed and civilian forces currently under the Army and Navy departments. (2) The Secretary of Defense will be a civilian appointed by the President, with multiple non-military deputy secretaries and assistants. (3) The Air Force will be divided into three branches, each headed by a deputy secretary, resulting in a unified air force, but the Navy will retain separate aircraft carriers and air force units based on the water. (4) All deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries will accept assignments designated by the President or the Secretary of Defense. (5) The President and the Secretary of Defense will have the power to establish coordinating and service agencies, which will be located in areas where materials are obtained to reduce expenses. (6) The Department of Defense will appoint a Chief of Staff and three commanders subordinate to him from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. (7) The Chief of Staff and the three commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will form an advisory committee to make recommendations to the President. (8) To avoid overemphasis on any one part, President Truman recommended that the appointment of the Chief of Staff should be based on a rotating system, rotating at least every two or three years. The President concluded, "I dare to assure Congress that once this merger is adopted as a national policy, both civilian and military officials will do their best to ensure the success of this merger."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th Telegram] The Baltimore Sun reported that, according to authoritative sources, key members of Truman's cabinet, Wallace, Ickes, Forrestal, and Judge Schwellenbach, will resign in 1946. The White House refused to confirm or deny this report. The Baltimore Sun reported that Wallace will lead the left-wing Democratic Party after resigning as Secretary of Commerce. Interior Secretary Ickes will resign to pursue his private life. Labor Secretary Judge Schwellenbach plans to resign next year to run for Senator of Washington State, and Navy Secretary Forrestal also plans to resign next year.</p>
<h3>Memoirs of Konoe Fumimaro: Soviet Policy Before Participating in the War; Willing to Join the German-Italian-Japanese Alliance to Dominate the East and Attempt to Include Iran and India in the Soviet Sphere of Influence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th Telegram] Konoe Fumimaro's posthumous memoirs state that in the late 1940s, the Soviet Union had in principle agreed to join the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact, becoming the Quadruple Entente to dominate the East. According to the attached secret agreement, Iran and India would become the Soviet Union's future sphere of influence, Japan would obtain the South Seas, Germany would take Central Africa, and Italy would gain North Africa, but this plan did not progress. Three months after the agreement in principle was established, German officials openly discussed the German-Soviet war. Japan formally proposed to the German government to avoid war with the Soviet Union, but the German side set it aside, saying that the German-Soviet war could be concluded in two or three months. Konoe strongly implied that he and Japan were both fooled by the power politics of Berlin, and said that neither Germany nor the Soviet Union attached importance to establishing an alliance. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka knew that war was possible between Germany and the Soviet Union, so he signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union to consolidate Japan's position. Konoe repeatedly mentioned Japan's hope that the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact to be close to the Soviet Union and the Axis powers. Germany, at least before Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov visited Berlin in November 1940, was moving towards cooperation between Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop proposed a four-power agreement plan, including the following points: (1) The Soviet Union declared its agreement to the principles of the Tripartite Pact to prevent war and help quickly restore peace. (2) The Soviet Union recognized the leadership of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the new order in Europe and Asia, and the three countries also guaranteed to respect Soviet territory. (3) The three countries had guaranteed not to assist any enemy of the allied countries, nor to participate in such national groups. In addition, it stipulated the establishment of a secret agreement on future spheres of influence. The Japanese government immediately approved this plan, and when Molotov visited Berlin, the German side also proposed it to him, but until Matsuoka went to Germany in March 1941, Tokyo had not heard from it since.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Helps Us Build a Navy: We Express Our Extreme Welcome</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th Telegram] After Secretary of the Navy Forrestal proposed that surplus U.S. ships be made available to China, Chinese naval attaché to the U.S. Rear Admiral Liu Tingfu said today, "So far, I have not had the opportunity to study the full text of the proposal, but any assistance from the United States in this regard, I believe, will be welcomed by China."</p>
<h3>U.S. Embassies and Consulates in Asia Will Undergo Major Expansion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th Telegram] U.S. State Department inspector Butler, who has just returned from overseas, expects that U.S. embassies and consulates in Asia, from North China to Cambodia and India, will be greatly expanded. Butler traveled in Asia for three months and has reopened most of the U.S. consulates in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Malay Peninsula, and the East Indies, with a portion of the staff starting to work first, and will soon increase to the normal number of people to provide appropriate protection to American people and American interests in Asia. Other embassies and consulates will also be restored immediately. Butler served as chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Beiping at the beginning of the war.</p>
<h3>Pauley's Report to the Reparations Committee's U.S. Representative</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th Telegram] Pauley, the U.S. presidential special envoy to the Japanese Reparations Committee, submitted an interim report to Truman and will also submit it to the Soviet Union and countries seeking reparations from Japan. According to Pauley, Japan had 154 people per square kilometer during the war, so the country's economy was unable to cope with reparations in terms of production. Furthermore, since Korea, Taiwan, and other places have been cut off, and Japanese people have continued to return to the country, its population will reach 208 people per square kilometer, making it quite difficult to provide for them. As for how much personal income Emperor Hirohito has, there are no statistics, but U.S. reparations officials regard the Emperor as just like other Japanese, and all his wealth should be used for reparations.</p>
<h3>U.S. Governor-General to Korea Arrived in Seoul Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Tension Increases at the Three-Power Conference; Enters Concrete Discussion Stage; Contents Are Closely Guarded Secrets, and No Communiqué Has Been Issued to Date; Soviet People Welcome Stalin's Return to Handling National Affairs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th Telegram] The three-power foreign ministers' meeting lasted for three hours and twenty minutes yesterday, and no statement has yet been issued. It is expected that the situation will become even more tense when the meeting continues today. Among the advisors to the three foreign ministers are experts on the Balkans, Iran, the governance of Germany, and the Far East, which shows that these issues will be raised for discussion. It is reported that the atmosphere in the initial meetings was indeed extremely friendly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th Telegram] The three-power foreign ministers' meeting is being conducted with great secrecy. Authoritative sources only say that the meeting had a good start. Otherwise, only yesterday's meeting or already entered the stage of specific discussion. It is difficult for the outside world to know the other circumstances. Observers speculate that the talks chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Burns yesterday afternoon, if they have indeed entered the stage of concrete discussion, will be longer than the previous talks. So far, the representatives seem to still be discussing technical issues. British Foreign Secretary Bevin visited Molotov before the meeting yesterday afternoon. Informed sources said that Bevin and Burns will pay their respects to Stalin. The Russians welcomed Stalin's return from his leave to handle national affairs again. Bevin is very concerned about the Iran incident and once again met with British Ambassador to Iran Prat to inquire about everything. Burns also summoned one of his staff, an Iran expert from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, who had just arrived in Soviet capital from Tehran, to report to Burns. Also, according to our Washington news: Reliable sources in the U.S. capital say that the three-power foreign ministers' meeting will discuss the Spanish question.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th Telegram] The secret nature of the Moscow meeting, although it has its reasons, is also related to the Soviet Union's intensified implementation of news censorship. Because the most important items on the agenda, such as the atomic issue and the Iran issue, have a major impact on the entire world, it is necessary to strictly maintain diplomatic secrecy. The Soviet Union's censorship system was relaxed once after the end of October this year, and in November and early December, Moscow correspondents were given reasonable freedom to send news, but it became strict again shortly before the three-power conference was held.</p>
<h3>U.S. Counterintelligence Unit Takes Over Japanese Secret Service - A Tool Used by Tojo to Control the People; Secret Torture Chamber to be Opened Regularly</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 19th] The U.S. Counterintelligence Unit today formally took over the Japanese Secret Service (also known as the "Terror Squad" Headquarters). This light gray, modern building overlooking the moat of the Imperial Palace has served as headquarters for ten years. The building has four floors, of which the middle floor, it is said, was occupied by the dreaded Secret Service, from where orders were issued, enabling Prime Minister Tojo to absolutely control the Japanese people. In its basement, Japanese people of all classes, as well as Americans, were secretly imprisoned and subjected to private torture. The headquarters has its own telephone system connecting all departments, and is equipped with powerful radio transmitting and receiving equipment, allowing direct communication with secret service units throughout the Far East. In 1940, Reuters' Tokyo bureau chief, James Cox, fell to his death from a fourth-floor window of this building. According to the Japanese Times at the time, Cox was arrested on July 19 of that year, along with "an unspecified number of foreigners," and Cox committed suicide to "avoid divulging secrets." The Secret Service also claimed that prison officials had tried to stop him, but the U.S. official conclusion was that he either jumped from the window under torture or was pushed by the Japanese. Subsequently, on the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, United Nations reporters were arrested at this Secret Service headquarters and interrogated on charges of "espionage." The head of the United Press Tokyo bureau, Mr. Hillis, was also among them. According to a U.S. Counterintelligence Unit investigator, Foreign Minister Yoshida was also once imprisoned in a cement basement, isolated from the outside world for forty-five days. In the next room, Bishop Tsugai of the Tokyo Methodist Church was imprisoned for one hundred and fifty days. It is reported that three U.S. B-29 pilots were also arrested at that time, but were soon released. At today's brief handover ceremony, a stone tablet inscribed with the "Japanese Bill of Rights," draped with the U.S. flag, was unveiled to signify the liberation of the Japanese people by the U.S. military occupation. Afterwards, the building will no longer be a secret torture chamber, but will be opened regularly to hear the grievances of the Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Iranian Issue - Touchstone for Three-Power Cooperation</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th] Today, senior officials told United Press that Chairman Stalin's return to Moscow provides Secretary of State Byrnes and Foreign Secretary Bevin with a better opportunity to have the Soviet Union withdraw from Iran and for the three powers to reach an agreement on the Iranian issue that complies with the Tehran Declaration. It is believed that Molotov was clearly unwilling to make concessions regarding the establishment of the Azerbaijan autonomous government, as it has become a fait accompli, which displeased Stalin. However, if Byrnes and Bevin present the issue as the basis for continued cordial relations among the three powers, Stalin may reconsider. United Press has learned that Byrnes accepts the Azerbaijan provincial government as representing the will of the people and insists that the issue must be discussed in accordance with the Tehran Agreement. According to well-informed sources, Bevin will support Byrnes with the utmost determination, but with slightly different intentions, saying that the British fear Soviet intrusion into the Middle East. United Press has learned that U.S. officials are deeply concerned about the situation in Iran, as they believe that the Iranian issue is the clearest test of whether the world can achieve harmony and cooperation under the promotion of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>British and American Representatives - Constantly in Contact with Their Home Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 19th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and the British Foreign Secretary, as well as the British and American envoys in Moscow, are constantly in contact with their respective governments by telegram or direct telephone. Weather permitting, British messengers fly to London daily. Foreign Secretary Bevin is keeping the British Dominions fully informed of the conference's progress, and the Chinese and French ambassadors are able to contact Bevin and Byrnes at any time. It is believed that Byrnes and Bevin will meet with Chairman Stalin on Friday or before, which is also Stalin's birthday.</p>
<h3>Iran Calls for Respect for the Tehran Declaration - Unrest Still Spreading</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tehran, 19th] Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi yesterday, amidst cheers in parliament, reiterated his decision to go to Moscow and again request the withdrawal of British, American, and Soviet troops stationed in Iran. It is also learned that the Democrats in northern Iran are advancing towards the Caspian Sea, and it is feared that the unrest in northern Iran cannot be prevented from spreading to the Kuji tribes in Iraq and Turkey. According to the Iranian Ambassador to Britain, speaking in London, the Soviet Union's interference in Iranian affairs in various ways is a blatant violation of the Tehran Declaration of December 1943.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 19th] The Iranian Ambassador to Britain issued a statement saying that Iran deeply hopes that the Moscow Conference can reach an agreement that respects the integrity of Iranian sovereignty. At a time when the United Nations is being established, it is heartbreaking and disappointing for the Iranian people that a faction within Iran is instigating the people to deny their own government and launch a separatist movement. This is a tragic example of treaty violation and a test of whether treaties, the Atlantic Charter, the United Nations Charter, and the joint declaration of the three powers will be respected after the war.</p>
<h3>British Wartime Prime Minister - To Go to the United States for Rest</h3>

<h3>East Indian People - Marches and Demonstrations - Dispatch of British Troops to Java Decided by Joint Chiefs of Staff</h3>
<p>[United Press Sukabumi, Java, 19th] 15,000 East Indian residents marched and demonstrated in Java today. Independence leaders gave speeches, saying that Java will always remain independent. Republican President Sukarno said, "The Netherlands has begun to waver, and Dutch imperialism must collapse."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 18th] State Department spokesman McDermott declared that the dispatch of British troops to the Dutch East Indies was decided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Japanese surrender. These troops are assigned to the Southeast Asia Command to assist in accepting the surrender and disarming of Japanese troops, and to protect the 100,000 civilians detained locally. The statement was issued to refute a report citing a State Department spokesman, saying that the United States should share responsibility with Britain for the current military operations against the Javanese National Army.</p>
<p>Dutch Statement of Position</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia, 19th] A Dutch spokesman said yesterday that the Netherlands fully allows Indonesians to have the right to self-existence and free development, but the Netherlands will never accept a solution that excludes the Dutch from bearing the final responsibility for security and legality. Vice Governor Van Mook's previous statement could have served as a good basis for negotiation, but it did not receive sufficient attention. Regardless of the final resolution of political issues, the Dutch are still prepared to cooperate fully with Indonesians to solve the growing economic difficulties.</p>

<h3>First Session of the United Nations General Assembly - May Be Postponed - Due to the Failure of Representatives from Several Countries to Arrive in Time - U.S. House Passes Bill for Full Participation</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 19th] The Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations unanimously agreed yesterday to hold the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on January 10 next year at Central Hall in Westminster.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 18th Special Dispatch] The date of the United Nations General Assembly will be changed due to some unforeseen reasons. Two hours after the Preparatory Committee decided on January 10 next year as the opening date, U.S. Representative Stevenson (Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of State) requested that the date of the General Assembly be postponed to January 12 or 14, because he had just received a call from Washington stating that the Queen Mary, which would carry the representatives of the United States and Latin American countries to London, had changed its departure date from January 3 to 7, so the representatives would not be able to reach London until the 12th.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 19th] The House of Representatives has just approved, by a vote of 344 to 15, the United States' full participation in the United Nations organization, including the provision of U.S. troops for deployment by the Security Council, etc., but the House Foreign Affairs Committee recommends that U.S. congressmen be allowed to attend the plenary sessions of the United Nations organization in a representative capacity. Therefore, the Senate must reconsider the bill before it is submitted to President Truman for signature. The bill authorizes the President, with the consent of a majority of both houses, to negotiate an agreement with the Security Council to specify the number and nature of U.S. troops that the Security Council may deploy.</p>

<h3>British Traitor - Amery Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 19th] The Evening Standard reported that John Amery, son of former Secretary of State for India Leopold Amery, was executed by hanging at Wandsworth Prison at 9:00 this morning (5:00 PM Shanghai time), and died within seconds. His father last night held a large number of letters addressed to every cabinet member, intending to use his position in the House of Commons to prolong his son's life, arguing that John's health was poor.</p>
<p>John pleaded guilty to all eight charges when he was tried at the Central Criminal Court last month, so the sentence was pronounced in eight minutes. This was unexpected by his family and defense lawyers, who feared that a prolonged trial would damage the family's reputation. John, who is now thirty-three years old, had already violated traffic rules seventy-four times at the age of twenty, and was declared bankrupt at the age of twenty-four, with debts of £5,081 and no assets. He himself told the bankruptcy liquidator that he had spent more than £3,000 on entertainment and travel. In 1933, John went to Shanghai as a newspaper reporter. When the war broke out, he was in the Riviera in France and was once sent to a expatriate concentration camp. After leaving the camp, he incited expatriates to join the army to fight against the Soviet Union. Later, he went to Berlin and worked for the Nazis as a broadcaster. In April 1945, when the Allied forces advanced into northern Italy, John tried to escape but failed and was captured by Italian patriots. Only a few soldiers and six civilians were present at the execution this morning. A car had been waiting outside the prison for several hours before the execution, with a man and a woman sitting in it. It is said that this was John's brother Julian Amery.</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Approves - Anglo-American Loan Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 19th] The House of Lords yesterday passed the government's motion to accept the Anglo-American Loan Agreement by a vote of 90 to 8, and also approved the Bretton Woods International Monetary Agreement. Lord Beaverbrook, who opposed the loan agreement, said in a speech before the vote that the government has bankers as its backers, and that socialists and bankers have now joined forces, so those who oppose the government's motion will inevitably fail. He does not blame the United States for the harsh conditions, saying that the United States can be described as a philanthropist, but this agreement is not suitable for the British economy, so we should thank the United States for its kindness on the one hand, and reject it on the other.</p>
<h3>Gales Raging Along the British and Portuguese Coasts - Worst in Five Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 19th] A gale raged across the English Channel yesterday, with wind speeds reaching seventy miles per hour, causing violent waves to batter the seawalls.

In Rottingdean near Brighton, a mine washed ashore and exploded, shaking the entire town, smashing all the windows, and causing considerable property damage. Houses in Brighton were also shaken by other mines exploding in the sea. The entire British Isles felt the power of the gale, and gale warnings along the coast remained in effect all day.</p>
<p>[United Press Lisbon, 18th] A storm passed through here on Wednesday, and the extent of the damage may be greater than the 1940 cyclone. Farmers are like startled birds, fearing that the Caparica volcano will erupt at the same time, and have left their homes to seek refuge. The gale has continued for thirty-six hours non-stop, blowing off roofs and sinking small boats. Giant waves crashed over the dikes and destroyed coastal houses.</p>
<h3>U.S. Surplus Merchant Ships - Four Thousand Five Hundred Ships - U.S. Merchants Have Right of First Refusal</h3>

The bill has now been sent to the House Committee. The Senate recommends that U.S. foreign-going merchant ships should have at least seven million tons and at most ten million tons, compared to only three million tons before the war. The total number of merchant ships engaged in domestic and foreign trade and shipping can reach between fifteen million and twenty million tons. A reasonable waiting period should be set for the sale of surplus merchant ships to allow U.S. merchants to purchase them. Afterwards, they can be purchased by foreign merchants.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Reiterates Allied Occupation of Japan - Aim is to Establish a Government Suitable for Democratic Principles - So As To Restore Its Position of Being Respected Throughout the World</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 19th Special Dispatch] General MacArthur today formally reiterated the fundamental purpose of the Allied occupation of Japan, saying, "The control of Japan and its people will be exercised through the Emperor and other assistants in the Japanese government to the greatest possible extent, in accordance with the objectives set forth in the terms of surrender." Today's statement emphasized that "We are now giving a completely defeated enemy an opportunity to correct its erroneous actions, so as to restore its position of being respected throughout the world." The ultimate goals of the United Nations are (1) disarmament and demobilization, and the destruction of the authority and power of the military, so as to ensure that Japan does not again threaten global peace and security. (2) To encourage the development of the desire for individual freedom and respect for basic human rights, in order to establish a peaceful, responsible government that is as suitable for democratic principles as possible.

<p>County Government Recovers Old Arrears of Land Tax</p>
<p>This county and other counties in eastern Zhejiang were occupied by enemy puppets and Communists for many years, resulting in the government's failure to collect land taxes for the 32nd and 33rd years. After the victory, the Executive Yuan issued a notice to all provinces and cities exempting this year's land tax and postponing the collection of old arrears of land tax for one year. Unexpectedly, the County Government recently used insufficient funds as an excuse to recover the old arrears in full, causing the people to suffer. This move is obviously disregarding the law.

<h3>Japanese Government Declaration: Dissolution of Parliament; Machida Appointed Party President</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] According to official sources, both the Progressive and Liberal parties have listed the preservation of the Emperor system as the first item in their campaign platform for the upcoming general election, with issues concerning the people's livelihood and the government relegated to secondary importance. Furthermore, the Japanese government today issued a declaration dissolving the parliament, expressing hope that the results of the upcoming general election will reflect the general wishes of the people and promising to absolutely refrain from any actions that might suggest official interference in the voting. Today's dissolution of parliament marks the completion of another historic event. In 1937, General Hayashi attempted to use the parliament as a political weapon to suppress forces opposed to the military clique. Following the dissolution of parliament, the electorate will directly decide which members introduced during the era of the military clique should be purged. The importance of the Emperor issue can be seen in the continuous discussion of it in this parliament. The largest party, the Progressive Party, has elected 82-year-old veteran parliamentarian Machida as its president. If the party wins a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, he will usually be recommended as the next Prime Minister. Machida previously served as president of the Minseito (Democratic Party).</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The *Washington Evening Star* today reported that the list of Japanese war criminals to be arrested by MacArthur is gradually expanding and is approaching the Imperial family, thus increasingly shaking the position of Emperor Hirohito. If Hirohito is listed as a war criminal, he will not be able to remain on the throne.</p>

<h3>Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] Delivers a Ten-Minute Speech at Nanyuan Airport in Beiping, Enthusiastically Answering Questions from Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Praising Truman's Sincere Attitude Toward China</h3>
<p>Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] was in Beiping for eight days, handling all matters, and everything was in order.

At that time, Vice Minister Xu led more than twenty Chinese and foreign reporters from Beiping to pay their respects to the Chairman at the Executive Headquarters.</p>
<p>Before the Speech, a Scene of Citizens Lining the Streets to Wait</p>
<p>When the reporters arrived, Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] and his wife were fully prepared and ready to board their car for departure. The entire citizenry, having learned that the Chairman would be leaving Beiping, gathered along the streets from the morning, braving the biting cold wind, to see him off. Out of consideration for the citizens, and unwilling to let them stand for so long in the cold wind, the Chairman advanced his departure time to show his concern. When the reporters arrived at the Executive Headquarters, Madame Chiang and Major General Shang Zhen notified them that the press conference would be held at Nanyuan Airport. Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek], accompanied by his wife and Major General Shang and his entourage, departed from the Executive Headquarters by car at 12:00 noon. The reporters followed in their cars, exiting the East Exit of Houyuan Wusi Temple, passing through Jiaodaokou South Street, Dafosi Street, Wangfu Street, Wangfujing Street, East Chang'an Street, exiting Zhengyangmen, Yongdingmen, and arriving directly at Nanyuan Airport. From Houyuan Wusi Temple to Yongdingmen, along the entire route, citizens and students from various schools were lined up in formation, standing and waiting. As the Chairman's car passed by, the citizens waved flags and shouted "Long Live," vying for the honor of catching a glimpse of the Chairman's elegance and smile. The atmosphere was fervent, and the sound reverberated through the clouds. The Chairman, pleased and happy in the car, frequently nodded in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>More Than Twenty Chinese and Foreign Reporters Raise Questions for Answers</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, the Chairman arrived at the airport and immediately held a press conference in the office of the Commander of the Tenth Air Force District. Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] and his wife arrived, and Vice Minister Xu introduced the Chinese and foreign reporters. The Chairman smiled, nodded, and shook hands with each of them as a greeting. After taking his seat, more than twenty Chinese and foreign reporters surrounded him, raising questions and requesting answers.</p>

The speech began at 12:35 PM. Due to the Chairman's special plane being ready for takeoff, the speech time was only a little over ten minutes. The time was rushed, and it seemed that he was unable to speak freely. The following is a record of the main points of the Chairman's Q&amp;A with the reporters:</p>
<p>Chairman Expresses Admiration for President Truman's Declaration</p>
<p>Reporter (hereinafter referred to as "Q"): What is the Chairman's opinion on President Truman's recent declaration regarding the United States' China policy? Chairman (hereinafter referred to as "A"): President Truman knows the situation in China deeply, especially he understands the current situation in China even more. His recent declaration expresses deep friendship towards China, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Q: Can President Truman's declaration promote progress in the negotiations between the National Government and the Communist Party?</p>
<p>A: It depends on the attitude of the Communist Party, whether they accept President Truman's opinion. I personally agree with President Truman's opinion very much.</p>
<p>Q: Communist Party representative Ye Jianying and his thirty entourage members have arrived in Chongqing. Will this help in resolving the Communist Party issue?</p>
<p>A: I only learned yesterday that they had arrived in Chongqing. I don't know their attitude and plans yet.</p>
<p>A Policy of Maintaining Peace and Friendship for Three Years</p>
<p>Q: President Truman's declaration states that both the National Government and the Communist Party should make concessions to each other, especially the government should make more concessions to the Communist Party, so that a compromise can be reached. What is the Chairman's opinion on this?</p>
<p>A: My consistent policy and opinion for the past three years has been to resolve the issue with the Communist Party through peaceful and friendly methods. President Truman's opinion in his declaration is exactly in line with my opinion.</p>
<p>The Traditional US Policy of Unchanged Relations with China</p>
<p>Q: Does the Chairman feel that President Truman's China policy has not changed?</p>
<p>A: The traditional US policy and friendship towards China have not changed. I greatly admire it.</p>
<p>My Government Institutions Will Be Participated in by All Factions</p>
<p>Q: One point in President Truman's declaration is that he hopes the Chinese government will expand its scope to include other political parties in the government. What is the Chairman's opinion?</p>
<p>A: In my speech at the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association on March 1st this year, I stated that after the National Assembly convenes, people from all parties and factions will be included in the government. President Truman's declaration is exactly the same as my declaration, and Mr. Truman's opinion is also exactly my opinion.</p>
<p>Will Meet with Marshall on the Way Back to Chongqing</p>
<p>Q: Special Envoy Marshall is coming to China. Where will the Chairman meet with Marshall? When will the Chairman return to Chongqing?</p>
<p>A: I may be able to meet with General Marshall on the way back to Chongqing, such as in Nanjing or Hankou.</p>
<p>The conversation ended at 12:40 PM. The Chairman stood up and shook hands with the reporters, and especially expressed to the Chinese reporters: I am very pleased to meet the people of North China during this trip to Beiping. I am very concerned about the people of North China, and I will come here often in the future. I hope to be able to come again in two months, and I hope you will convey this meaning to the people.

<p>Chairman Chiang and his wife held a grand tea party at Huiren Hall in Beiping on the afternoon of the 15th, hosting Chinese and foreign guests, with over 260 people attending. During the party, he delivered a speech, encouraging them to have the spirit of steadfastness, unyielding loyalty, and dedication to the country, and to lead the completion of the great cause of national construction.

<h3>How General Marshall Achieved Success (Translated from the *New York Herald Tribune*)</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall is one of the few military leaders in history to have defeated Germany and Japan in an unprecedented war. He entered the highest institution for planning operations in the United States on September 1, 1939, as Chief of Staff. At that time, the German army poured into Poland. The U.S. regular army was poorly equipped and numbered less than 200,000. The result of the military build-up has made the current strength of the U.S. military exceed eight million. During the years he stayed in Washington, D.C., to plan the strategy to defeat the enemy, he always longed to personally participate in field operations. He almost got the task of leading the Allied forces to attack Europe, but because President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill believed that he was an indispensable figure in planning Allied operations, his wish was not fulfilled.</p>
<p>He did not come from West Point Military Academy. After serving as a cadet in the army and a football player at the Virginia Military Institute, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1901. The following year, Marshall was immediately ordered to go to the Philippines and served in the 30th Infantry Division with the rank of lieutenant. After that, he returned to China to continue his studies, and then was appointed as an instructor at the Army Military Academy and the Staff School, and then returned to the Philippines.</p>
<p>When he hastily prepared a plan to occupy Manila (for exercise purposes), his commander, Major General Bell, told other officers: "Gentlemen, please see that Major General Wair is the greatest military genius in the United States since Jackson."</p>
<p>During World War I, he wanted to participate in field operations, but his superiors greatly appreciated his talent for planning operations. Finally, he successively served as staff officer in the headquarters of the First Division of the U.S. in Europe and the First Army. He planned the occupation of Kentigny and the surrender climax of August 1918. After that, he planned and successfully implemented the most glorious battle in the last war, that is, the work of transferring 820,000 troops in two weeks to prepare for the fierce Moose Argonne offensive. He won the praise of General Pershing. After General Pershing presided over the General Staff after the end of the war, he was appointed adjutant and returned to Washington, D.C. with General Pershing. It took five years to reorganize and strengthen the California Army School. In 1936, General Craig, the then Chief of Staff, promoted him to brigadier general. Two years later, General Craig appointed him as Deputy Chief of Staff. In 1939, he jumped to Chief of Staff. Since then, he has become the mastermind behind the powerful military power of the Allies. Riding, boating, tennis, and movies are his leisure pastimes. He has never forgotten that he is an infantryman and the person who loves fighting the most.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Welcoming Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The motherland has recovered, and it has been four months. When the good news was first announced, the whole country was ecstatic. Those who need too much often neglect each other; those who expect too much from governance are often greatly disappointed. As a result, incidents arise day by day, and chaotic phenomena grow day by day. The needs and expectations of the people are all like clouds swept away by a tornado. Small recoveries can be obtained, but the people's grievances arise in response. In fact, the source of grievances comes half from the small inadequacies of human planning and half from the inevitability of evil forces. There is an English saying called "Necessary evil." There are no precedents for things, and changes arise suddenly. Preparations are insufficient, and the scope is too large. To jointly bear the responsibility and recover from the pseudo-system, to correct and vigorously build new foundations, it is naturally impossible to have the effect of starting to work and achieving results within a month. Ordinary people do not understand political principles. Their emotions are expressed in criticism, and when criticism reaches its extreme, complaints and slanders become numerous. Today, people's hearts are unsettled, and their lives are uneasy. If one is not blind, how can one say that one has not seen it? However, when people are in dire straits, they return to their roots. In pain and suffering, they never fail to call out to their parents. Amidst various complaints and slanders, they still naturally maintain their desire to live and happily display their continuous hope, as if saying, "Although there is chaos, it is limited to a temporary period, and words are not one-sided. With this man here, what worries do we have?" There is no other reason.</p>
<p>How can this be made clear? Since Chairman Chiang's arrival in Beiping on the 11th of this month, the cheers of over ten million people inside and outside Yuguan have been unprecedented. Every word and deed of the Chairman, the way he speaks, whether short or long, high or low, fast or slow, is transmitted far and wide by electric waves as if measured by a meter. Those who hear it feel as if it came from his own mouth. They are so grateful that they are moved to tears. This is especially true in the nine provinces of the Northeast. The other day, the Chairman turned south and flew to the capital. Tens of thousands of people welcomed him in the suburbs, and the people of Shanghai yearned to see his face. The strength of public sentiment and the heat of popular support are no less than when his entourage was delayed in Yanjing. Among them, many people petitioned, complaining about their suffering and stating their grievances. Over a thousand cases were received. Looking back at Emperor Yao, with his clear eyes and perceptive ears, who was the center of the world's songs and lawsuits, it was no more than this. Why? As said before, the people seem to say, "With one man here, what worries do we have?" The people's feelings are so moved that it happens naturally without any effort.</p>
<p>However, how does the Chairman achieve this? I remember when he was trapped in Chongqing, enemy planes attacked day and night, more than ninety times a year, and the situation was precarious. A wise gentleman cried out to the crowd, "Don't be afraid! Chairman Chiang's perseverance is great, and he will definitely persevere until victory." And so it was. The significance of perseverance is so great! Zeng Wenzheng (Zeng Guofan) used to guard Qimen, a territory as small as a bullet, surrounded by enemies, with no reinforcements arriving. However, Zeng smoked his water pipe, played chess, lectured, and handled documents as usual. He once discussed the key to his success in life, and he stroked his beard and said, "What do I know? I only have a secret manual of eighteen chapters on perseverance, and I still haven't finished using it." Li Hongzhang, as a senior disciple, earnestly asked for the manual during an interval. Zeng lectured on the first chapter, which began with the meaning of the chapter. It was about an old man sending his son to the market to buy vegetables, but he didn't return for a long time. The old man was surprised and investigated, and saw his son and a porter holding each other in a ditch, unable to pass, because neither was willing to go into the water to give way. The old man pointed at the porter and said, "Come! Give me your load. I will go into the water, put it on my head, and not wet your goods. After you go over, I will carry it away again, how about that?" He spoke and bent down, making a gesture to untie his shoes. The person humbly declined, and the difficulty was resolved. This is the first chapter of the perseverance manual, a trace of government. Li Hongzhang was very pleased and asked for more. Zeng smiled and said, "If you get this, you will never use it all up, why ask for more?" Therefore, Zeng's perseverance manual was lost, and those who understand its meaning are also extremely rare. Only Chiang Kai-shek likes perseverance all his life. His use of perseverance is greatest in the eight years of bitter fighting. Recently, the people of the north and south have been displaced and complaining, and the situation is almost uncontrollable. However, the Chairman, with a light vehicle, stabilized the noisy and silenced them. Without doing anything, the tributaries and remnants of perseverance have such miraculous achievements. It is said that the Chairman admires Zeng Wenzheng, presumably the two wise men have a tacit understanding of the subtle things.</p>
<p>It is often said that politics is completed with assistance, and success is lost with the slightest negligence. The common people, loving and supporting Chairman Chiang as they do today, have reached the extreme. If there is no way to maintain their trace and extend their inner feelings, then the water that carries the boat can also capsize it. Today's problem is that politics comes from many sources and is becoming increasingly cumbersome. One party leader has more than three ministers, and when one thing happens, everyone is responsible, but it seems that no one is responsible. Even competing for profit and shirking responsibility in times of trouble, unknowingly falling apart, many times over. The people tell each other about these things. The expression "With one man here, what worries do we have?" will eventually be insufficient to unify the people's will and straighten the political trend.</p>
<p>I believe that the plan for today, to save the current situation, is nothing more than the eight characters of "following the name, verifying the reality, and ensuring rewards and punishments." I think that among the thousands of petitions, there must be cases that can be used to establish a conviction. If they are cleared up and reported to the high officials, and the original documents are fully exhausted, the world will know that this can be used to establish the scale of constitutional government in the big way, and to understand the hidden grievances of the people in the small way. In the transition, if the national affairs do not change completely and gradually reach the upper level, I would not believe it. England is called the home of constitutionalism, but in the end, there is no written constitution. In the beginning, it was derived from individual cases, summarized based on precedents, which is what is called Case Made Law. All freedom is obtained in this way, which is far deeper and clearer than empty writing and wandering without return. Today's talkers of the constitution are competing in comparison and pursuing general theories, while forgetting the important things at hand and not eagerly drawing parallels from examples and observing the general from the specific. No gentleman is more ignorant than this. In the article of welcoming Chairman Chiang, I connect and write about these things.</p>
<h3>Account of the Ordeal of American Pilots Captured by the Communist Army: A Harrowing 38-Day Escape to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[United Press Agency, Tianjin, 19th] Six American airmen who crashed in a snowstorm on November 10th, about 270 miles south of Peiping (Beijing), were captured by the Communist army. After a difficult 38 days, they have escaped danger and returned here today. Although they appear somewhat worn, they are clearly healthy and unaffected. On November 10th, they were flying a "fish-when" bomber from Peiping to Tianjin when they encountered severe weather, lost their bearings, and were forced to land in a field near Heqing Village. The farmers initially ignored them after they landed, but later, several Communist soldiers arrived, pointed guns at them, and escorted them to a nearby village, where they became prisoners. Lieutenant Hall Broolk requested their release from the Communist army leader, who replied that it was a "political matter" and had to be handled through proper channels. They waited for American planes to search for them, but each time a plane flew overhead, the Communist army would try their best to hide them, preventing them from being seen.</p>
<p>The Communist army leader repeatedly told them that they were not prisoners. However, Lieutenant Hall Broolk retorted, "These people are sitting around us with guns pointed at us; what do you call that?" The Communist army continuously tried to indoctrinate them, attempting to propagandize these six Americans. Several times, they asked Lieutenant Hall Broolk and another airman if they would be willing to write something praising the Communist army and its leader, saying that they would treat them very well. However, both refused. They also tried to have them sit properly to take a commemorative photo, which was also rejected. Some Communist soldiers told the American airmen that American planes were attacking their villages and that the Communists and the American army were in conflict. One soldier even stated bluntly, "The Communist army is at war with the American army."</p>
<p>The Communist army hid the plane. Lieutenant Hall Broolk and a partner ran to the plane and tried their best to destroy the equipment on board. The partner turned on the battery, letting the current drain, and the speaker on the plane emitted a loud noise. The Communist soldiers were alarmed and held a gun to him, asking what he was doing. At the same time, Hall Broolk was in the rear of the plane, destroying everything he could, also with a gun pointed at him. Later, the six men were moved to Renqiu Village and locked in a fenced area, guarded by soldiers.</p>
<p>Finally, on November 25th, they decided to escape. Under the cover of darkness, they crawled out, and walked to a marshy area. That day, they walked through the fields, covering over 110 li (about 36 miles). As dusk approached, they sent two men into a village to find water and food. They found water but no food and prepared to return to where their companions were hiding to meet up. Suddenly, a group of soldiers and civilians rushed towards them. They tried their best to respond. One was hit on the shoulder with a gun butt. They fled for their lives, and the soldiers tried to stop them, firing several shots in pursuit. The four companions who were hiding saw that the two were in danger and about to be captured, so they came out to rescue them. The group of Chinese soldiers and civilians, seeing four more Americans arrive, turned around and retreated into the village.</p>
<p>The six men then continued walking until late at night, reaching a swampy area with crossroads, which they could not cross. Although they eventually crossed, they were spotted by the Communist army at daybreak and became prisoners again. The soldiers confiscated their wedding rings, lighters, and other personal items, but the next day, the Communist military administration returned most of the items to them. However, at night, in the grass huts, Communist soldiers would often use old-fashioned hand grenades and rifles to tap on their shins, waking them up.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the Communist army transported them to Xinjian Village in an ox cart and then sent them back to Heqing Village, where the Communist army treated them very well, giving them excellent food. The Communist army wanted the Americans to wear Eighteenth Route Army uniforms, but they only put on the trousers and refused to wear anything else. The Communist army leader's persistent desire for them to wear Communist uniforms was probably to make others believe that they had joined the Communist Party.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Communist army leader told them that they could go back. They were sent to Xinjian Village, and the Communist army retreated, saying that the Communist army was fighting the Central Army ahead. American planes had dropped some winter clothing a few days earlier, which the Communist army had collected and given to them. Everyone put on as much as they could, and the rest was given to the Communist army to repay them for the good food. This was the thirty-fifth day after their capture. They again moved toward the friendly army's front line, about 20 li (about 6 miles) from where the Central Army was located. There, two American officers were waiting for them and finally brought them back to Tianjin safely. Upon arrival in Tianjin, they were immediately examined. Although they had suffered hardship, they were fortunately unharmed. When the six men went to report to General Rockey, Rockey's face showed joy, saying, "This is the best Christmas gift I could have received."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang inspects the 3rd Regiment of the U.S. Marine Amphibious Forces in Peiping. Standing beside him are General Rockey, Commander of the U.S. Marine Amphibious Forces, and General Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Zone.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Leaves Peiping, Citizens See Him Off</h3>
<p>From the time Chairman Chiang arrived on the 11th until he left Peiping on the 18th, he stayed in Peiping for seven days. During this time, in addition to summoning the heads of party, government, and military organs in North China to hear reports and give instructions, he also convened briefings with responsible individuals from all sectors, received Chinese and foreign guests, addressed students, attended various gatherings, and met with local gentry, prominent figures, and representatives from all walks of life for discussions.</p>
<p>Lingering Sorrow, Reluctant Farewell</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang flew south from Peiping today. The entire city saw him off, people shoulder to shoulder, cheering along the streets, craning their necks to admire his demeanor and express their respect. All revealed a sense of lingering sorrow and reluctance to part.</p>
<p>Before leaving Peiping, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen, inspected the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters, the Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Peiping Branch of the Youth Corps, earnestly encouraging comrades in the party and corps to embody the spirit of labor service and work for the benefit of the people.</p>
<p>Applause and Flags, Enthusiastic Scene</p>
<p>After the inspection, from the official residence to the Nanyuan Airport, on both sides of the road, men, women, old, and young spontaneously lined up to see him off, like mountains and seas. Elders from Peiping and Tianjin, such as Jin Yunpeng, also came to the airport to bid farewell. Young students admired their leader and were reluctant to leave. Some could not help but rush out from the ranks to shake hands with the Chairman by his car to say goodbye. The sounds of cheering and applause, along with the waving of flags, created a scene of intense enthusiasm. The Chairman's smiling face and kind expression filled those welcoming him with joy. Before boarding the plane, the Chairman met with reporters at the airport, including more than twenty Chinese and foreign journalists. The Chairman went to the airport at 12:50 PM. The heads of military and government organs in Peiping, including Director Li Zongren, Commander Sun Lianzhong, Mayor Xiong Bin, and more than two hundred representatives from various sectors, all went to the airport to see him off.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Market Initially Weak, Then Firm; US Dollars See More Progress; Hong Kong Bills Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw initial weakness as short sellers continued to exert pressure. Fortunately, banks from the Sichuan group acted as pillars, gradually buying at low prices, managing to keep the 700,000 mark intact despite its precariousness. Near noon, short sellers rushed to cover, and because banks were closed today, the need to square up positions became urgent, causing a sudden depletion of available supply. There were even rumors of imminent official listing, leading to a gradual firming of the situation. Securities firms were extremely busy, and market sentiment was slightly stimulated, causing prices to rebound to 740,000 by the afternoon. Finally, prices hovered around 730,000, closing up 11,000 from the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed at 79,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars rose to around 450. Informal lending rates rose from 7% to around 10% due to a sudden increase in demand from the securities sector.</p>
<p>The US dollar followed the ups and downs of the gold market. Foreign trading companies aggressively bought at low prices, and major players also entered the market. From the lowest price of 1175 yuan, prices gradually rose, almost reaching 1245 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, prices hovered around 1230 yuan, closing up 20 yuan from the previous day. There were rumors that new Hong Kong bills were worth only 30% or less than old bills in Hong Kong. Factoring in an exchange rate of 85%, this was much lower than in Shanghai, causing a widespread sell-off of new bills. Later rumors that imports were prohibited in Hong Kong exacerbated the plunge. As a result, old bills closed steady, while new bills plunged 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Weakens; Indica and Glutinous Rice Remain Firm</h3>
<p>In yesterday's rice market, rice from the southern gangs was still digestible, with moderate sales. Japonica rice weakened by 100-200 yuan. Indica yuan rice remained firm due to scarce arrivals and inventories. The oil market was weak in the morning but firmed in the afternoon, rising slightly by several hundred yuan. However, with price-controlled oil about to be sold, the situation is unlikely to improve. Flour and bran continued to rise by over 100 yuan due to strong demand from the Fujian and Guangdong gangs. There was a large amount of medium and lower grade miscellaneous brand flour, and merchants in this area remained slack, resulting in high prices for top quality and stagnation for lower quality. The soybean market shifted from stagnation to stability, down slightly by 100-200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Snippets</h3>
<p>Imported paper trended upward, with sellers raising prices and strong demand from other locations, resulting in a firm market.</p>
<p>Raw silk prices fluctuated, with tussah silk slightly weaker. Tea trading remained stable.</p>
<p>North and South goods rose compared to yesterday, as Hong Kong gangs began operations in various markets. Sichuan pepper rose by 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Shipments of Sugar, Gasoline, and Oranges Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Jiangmi, a vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Taiwan line, sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan on the 8th of this month, arriving in Keelung at 4 PM on the 11th. After stopping for five days, it returned to Shanghai from Taiwan on the 16th, arriving in Shanghai at around 1 PM yesterday and berthing at the Jinliyuan Wharf. This shipment brought a large quantity of sugar, 7,100 bags, and gasoline, 3,110 barrels, which has already begun unloading. The ship will sail to Taiwan on its next voyage.</p>
<p>The Maoli vessel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Haimen, Zhejiang, carrying a large shipment of Huangtai oranges, totaling over 7,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Eight Government Bonds Drawn</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance held a drawing for the redemption of eight types of government bonds on the 11th of this month. The bonds included the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Government Bond, the Ding Bond, the 27th Year of the Republic Relief Government Bond, the 30th Year of the Republic Construction Government Bond, the second issue, the 31st Year of the Republic Allied Victory Government Bond, the 32nd Year Government Bond for Consolidation of Provincial Debts, and bond classes 1, 2, 3, and 4. All winning bond tickets and matured interest coupons, except for the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Government Bond Ding Bond, which will continue to be handled temporarily according to the tariff-secured debt amortization method, the remaining winning bond tickets will be handled for payment by the various managing banks.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market remained stable. Although it softened slightly in the morning due to falling gold prices, buyers flocked in and business with Beijing, Hangzhou and other locations was brisk. In the afternoon, the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs bought large quantities of 10-count yarn, making the trend increasingly stable. Prices rose by about 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and market sentiment remained buoyant.</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Raw Materials for 60-Count Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn mill managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs relies entirely on old stock for the raw materials to spin 60-count cotton yarn. The raw cotton shipped by the Relief Administration is also cotton that has been stored for four or five years, and lacks tensile strength making it difficult to spin 60 count yarn.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Strong; Charcoal Shows Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>The coal market saw continued real sales of white coal, and the market atmosphere was strong. Industrialists purchased lump bituminous coal, slightly supporting the prices, but sales of bituminous coal dust to factories were quiet and the trend remained mediocre. Retail sales of charcoal were active, showing signs of a turnaround, as current market prices have fallen to production area prices. Several ships of Jiangxi charcoal from Haimen arrived in Shanghai yesterday, resembling Huangyan Jiangxi charcoal. The transaction price was 5,000 yuan per load.</p>
<h3>Category C Bonds Break 800; Securities Market Hot; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>The bond market continued its momentum from the previous day. Speculators aggressively sold off, causing Category C bonds to fall from 700 yuan to below 650 yuan. Small banks worked hard to absorb the selling, providing support. Industry insiders gradually obtained external assistance and opportunistically re-entered the market, pushing prices back up to over 700 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign stocks rose sharply amid recovery talk, bolstering the buying momentum. Major players acted decisively, pushing prices up significantly. By noon, prices broke through the 800 yuan mark, closing at the highest price. The results showed a sharp rise of 40 yuan to over 100 yuan compared to the previous close. Miscellaneous brands did not keep up due to the late hour, but after the noon close, the momentum was overwhelming, continuing to rise in the commotion.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks initially weakened but then became popular. Although some sold off, major players continued to aggressively absorb at low prices, and banks joined in. With the multi-party lineup strengthened, industry insiders seized the opportunity to push up prices and were stimulated by the rising momentum of foreign stocks. Those who had not acquired foreign stocks rushed to buy Chinese stocks, resulting in many closing at peak prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn rose 75 yuan, Maya 90 yuan, Xin Guang 3 yuan, Jing Fu 3 yuan, and Qin Xing 2.5 yuan. Cold market giants such as the Commercial Press were in high demand with no supply, and buyers were very active after the close, with bidding continuing to increase.</p>
<p>The momentum of foreign stocks was overwhelming. Securities firms, money houses, and investors eagerly absorbed, creating a buying frenzy. Supply was extremely limited, resulting in too few loaves for too many people. In addition, there were various rumors that the industry association was resuming operations and that foreign factories could apply the same workaround of foreign banks that first resumed operations and then registered. This led to the long-awaited resolution of the transfer issue and because the bottom prices of the depressed foreign stocks were very attractive, buyers competed to offer high prices, hoping to secure their purchases. As a result, the market was dominated by buyers, with a further increase of over 10% compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>A Comparison of the New and Old Company Laws for Limited Companies</h3>
<p>– Nai Sheng</p>
<p>To adapt to modern economic trends, the National Government has revised and re-issued the Company Law. The current Company Law has many differences from the previous Company Law. Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, and merchants must pay close attention to the Company Law. I will only list the differences between the new and old Company Laws in the most important part, the chapter on Limited Companies, as follows:</p>
<p>1. Establishment: The old Company Law stipulated that a limited company should have seven or more promoters. The current new law stipulates that five or more are sufficient. The new law also allows foreigners, whether residing in China or not, to participate in Chinese companies.</p>
<p>2. Shares: The old Company Law stipulated that the capital of a limited company should be divided into shares, with the amount of each share being uniform and not less than 20 yuan. The new law has no such minimum amount requirement. The old law allowed a company to issue bearer shares, but the number of shares could not exceed one-third of the total number of shares. The new law stipulates that bearer shares can be issued up to one-half. The old law only allowed the issuance of one type of stock when a company was established, unless for capital increase or when issuing company bonds, at which point preference shares could be created. However, in the new law, preference shares and common shares can be issued simultaneously when the company is first established.</p>
<p>3. Shareholders' Meeting: The old Company Law stipulated that each shareholder of a company had one vote per share. If a shareholder had more than 11 shares, the articles of association should restrict their voting rights, but the total voting rights of each shareholder, including the voting rights exercised on behalf of other shareholders, could not exceed one-fifth of the voting rights of all shareholders. However, in the new law, unless otherwise stipulated in the articles of association, there is no such provision.</p>
<p>4. Directors: The old Company Law stipulated that a company should have at least five directors, elected by the shareholders' meeting from among the shareholders. The new law reduces this to three, but one-half of the directors must reside in China. If the board of directors has a chairman, the chairman must be a Chinese citizen residing in China.</p>
<p>5. Managers: The old Company Law did not have detailed provisions for managers. The new law stipulates that the appointment and dismissal of managers and deputy managers must be decided by a majority of the directors, and the same method is used for their remuneration. The new law also has clear provisions for the responsibilities and powers of managers.</p>
<p>6. Company Bonds: The old Company Law stipulated that the total amount of company bonds issued by a company could not exceed the total amount of paid-up capital. If the company's existing assets were less than the total amount of paid-up capital, it could not exceed the amount of existing assets. The new law stipulates that company bonds cannot exceed the total amount of the company's assets remaining after deducting liabilities.</p>
<p>7. Capital Increase: The old Company Law stipulated that when a company raised new shares, old shareholders should be given priority to subscribe. If there was a surplus, it could then be raised from others. The new law still follows this, but the new shares subscribed by old shareholders should not exceed the original proportion in principle. For example, if someone holds one-fifth of the shares in a company, then when the company increases its capital, the new shares subscribed by that person should not exceed one-fifth.</p>
<p>8. Dissolution: The old Company Law stipulated that the dissolution of a company must be approved by more than half of the shareholders representing more than half of the total number of shares, with the consent of more than two-thirds of the voting rights of the shareholders present. The new law requires the attendance of shareholders representing three-quarters of the shares.</p>
<p>The above eight points are relatively obvious differences. In the current Company Law, there is also a special difference from the old law, which is the provision for the management of foreign companies in China. During this post-war construction period, China needs a huge amount of foreign capital, and allied nations are also willing to invest in China. Therefore, the current Company Law has a special article to manage this matter, which was not found in the old Company Law.</p>

<h3>Chongqing University Students Petition: Eager to Return Home, Requesting Financial Assistance; Ministry of Education Responds Earnestly, Willing to Act as Students' Nanny</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Aviation News] Over seven hundred students from National Chongqing University, recently entrusted by student associations from eight wartime universities, including National Major University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, Guizhou University, Guiyang Medical College, Guiyang Normal College, Guangxi University, and Sichuan Provincial College of Education, to assist in returning home for continued studies,</p>
<h3>Petition from Eight Universities</h3>
<p>formed a group and arrived in Chongqing at 9:00 AM on the 14th, representing the eight universities to petition the Ministry of Education. They also issued a letter to the public stating: "With the victory of the War of Resistance, we are eager to return home. We urge the Ministry of Education to allocate us to volunteer universities for continued study as soon as possible, and request the same treatment as students from universities relocated inland, so that we can currently focus on our studies with peace of mind." Reportedly, these universities had already made this request three months ago, urging the Ministry of Education to make proper arrangements. Furthermore, representatives were sent to the Ministry of Education again the night before to petition, but without any indication of progress. Therefore, on the morning of the 14th, a group of seven hundred students gathered and marched from Shapingba into the city to petition the Ministry of Education, requesting three points:</p>
<h3>Requesting Three Points</h3>
<p>(1) To be allocated to desired schools, corresponding departments, and grades for continued study. (2) To be provided with convenient transportation and travel expenses. (3) To have the allocation matters completed before March of next year. All the students gathered at the Sichuan Normal College playground, and after several twists and turns, Vice Minister Hang Liwu finally addressed the students earnestly around 7:00 PM, stating briefly: "The desire of wartime students to return home to study is human nature. The Ministry of Education has already made a decision in principle, and detailed measures are also being drafted. The Ministry of Education is like the students' nanny, and all reasonable matters will be properly handled."</p>
<h3>Response from the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry then responded with three points: (1) All students who relocated from the war zone due to the war will be regarded as wartime students. (2) The Ministry of Education will be responsible for financially assisting impoverished wartime students to return home. (3) After returning home, they will be provided with convenient transfer opportunities, and will definitely not be allowed to drop out of school. In the end, after answering students' inquiries, all students expressed satisfaction and shouted, "We trust our nanny, Vice Minister Hang!" Everyone applauded in unison. However, after Vice Minister Hang left, a portion of the students insisted on not returning to school. Subsequently, a vote was held with 259 votes against and 232 votes in favor of returning to school. Afterwards, the university president Zhang Hongyuan, dean of the School of Business Zhu Guozhang, and others persuaded them. Around 9:30 PM, the Ministry of Education dispatched eight special transportation vehicles to transport all the students back to Shapingba in two trips. (Yun)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Disaster-Stricken Schools; Appeal to the Political Participation Council for Assistance in Allocating Enemy Property Houses</h3>
<p>[This City News] The Shanghai Private Disaster-Stricken Schools Federation, due to the destruction of school buildings, held a joint meeting at the Patriotic Girls' High School a few days ago to discuss everything. In addition to applying to the municipal authorities for relief, they also jointly sent a letter to the Chairman of the Political Participation Council, requesting that a proposal be submitted to allocate enemy property houses or funds for repairs. The application schools are listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Applying Schools</h3>
<p>Sun Yuan, Principal of Shanghai Private Patriotic Girls' High School; Yu Ziyu, Principal of Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School and Affiliated High School; Wang Peisun, Principal of Nanyang Middle School; Mei Songxian, Principal of Mingzong Girls' High School; Lu Jizeng (Acting), President of Daxia University; Xu Songshi, Principal of Chongde Girls' High School; Wang Zhen, Principal of Chengzhong Middle School; Chen Hongbi, Principal of Guangdong Elementary and Middle School; He Shizhen, Principal of Chizhi College and Affiliated High School; Wang Xinkang, Principal of Qingxin Middle School; Zhang Rongzhen, Principal of Qingxin Girls' High School; Zhou Huiyi, Principal of Xinmin Middle School; Yan Zhenyu, Principal of Yuqing Middle School; Chen Qide, Principal of Mellon Middle School. The original letter was addressed to Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Political Participation Council, and Wang Yunwu and Wang Yong, and the gist is as follows:</p>
<h3>Letter to the Political Participation Council</h3>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, more than half of Shanghai's cultural institutions were destroyed by the Japanese invaders. The original school buildings of our schools were mostly located in Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Nanshi, etc., all of which were often impacted by artillery fire, either completely destroyed, partially damaged, or although the houses remained, doors, windows, tables, chairs, books, and instruments were all looted. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Education is the foundation of the country, and the country should be built before the country is built. Therefore, our schools have separately applied to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, requesting the allocation of enemy property houses, or funds for repairs, and jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan Ministry of Education, temporarily requesting a loan from the National Bank for restoration and repair, and enrichment of equipment, etc., 10,000,000 yuan per school. This loan will be supplemented and returned from the Japanese war reparations in the future. So far, none of them have been approved. Our schools can't help but worry about it, so on the 6th of this month, we held a joint meeting of Shanghai Private Disaster-Stricken Schools at Patriotic Girls' High School, and decided to send a letter to the Political Participation Council to submit a discussion and provide assistance. Sincerely, because the Political Participation Council is a public opinion organ, and you and other executives are also the Chairman of the Political Participation Council, you have always been familiar with the pain and embrace it, and care about education. Therefore, we especially urge you to submit the above two items requested by Min School and others to the General Assembly for discussion as soon as possible, that is, one is to allocate enemy property houses for all those completely destroyed to fill the school buildings, and the other is to temporarily borrow from the National Bank for restoration and repair and enrichment of equipment, etc., 10,000,000 yuan per school, and approve it, and inform the Executive Yuan Ministry of Education, and the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle it, so that our schools can return to the classics as soon as possible, and we can't help but wait for orders.</p>

<h3>National Reconstruction Education</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>If we do not deny that education should adapt to the needs of the country and assume the mission of the times, then future education should move towards the path of national reconstruction. During the War of Resistance, we worked hard on wartime education (or called emergency education, national crisis education, national defense education, national education, ...), which contributed to the victory of the War of Resistance. After the victory, we should always devote ourselves to national reconstruction education in order to achieve the greatest goal of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>How should national reconstruction education be implemented? It can be started from the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Simultaneous Advancement of School Education and Social Education. At present, there are not only many school-age children out of school in my country, but also more illiterate adults. If these illiteracy are not eliminated, the construction of the country cannot be realized. To eliminate illiteracy, it is of course necessary to popularize education, add as many schools as possible, force children to go to school, and at the same time establish mass schools to implement adult remedial education. In this way, taking care of both children and adults, and advancing school education and social education simultaneously, can be effective.</p>
<p>(2) Balance Knowledge Imparting and Physical Training. In the past, education only focused on the transmission of knowledge and neglected physical health, resulting in a group of weak scholars. In the future, the implementation of national education should always strive for the sound development of children's physical and mental health, so that the balance and coordination of knowledge and strength can be achieved.</p>
<p>(2) Combining Production Skills and Scientific Knowledge. Based on the principle of children's physical health, implement production labor, and study social and natural science from production labor. In this way, the skills obtained are productive, and the knowledge is scientific. Improve production skills with scientific knowledge, and promote scientific exploration from production work.</p>
<p>(4) Connecting Group Training and Moral Cultivation. National education must pay attention to the organization and application ability of group activities, so that children can cultivate their individual morality from the group. On the one hand, it can develop good character, and on the other hand, it can develop the ability to participate in political organizations as adults.</p>
<h3>Chairman Cares for Students; Provides Free Food</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 18th Dispatch] The Chairman cares very much for the students in Beiping. Because the students living in Beiping's universities and middle schools are from other counties, transportation is blocked, economic sources are cut off, and food cannot be maintained, Director Li of the Garrison Headquarters had previously approved the food department special commissioner to issue one month's food to the students living in each school at a price. However, the central government stipulates that because the recovered areas are exempt from land tax, the food for all agencies and schools should be purchased by themselves, and if it is allocated, it must also be paid. When the Chairman arrived in Beiping, in order to take care of the students' food difficulties, he specially approved the free allocation of miscellaneous grains for relief. After receiving the order, the food department special commissioner immediately notified each school to prepare a register to receive the food. The allocation was roughly completed on the 17th and 18th. The students of each school are deeply grateful for the Chairman's loving virtue.</p>

<h3>Shang Warehouse Applies for Unsealing</h3>
<p>More than 70 Chinese warehouses in this city, due to the sealing of the stored materials, specially formed a joint office of the Chinese warehouse alliance, and urged all material owners, those who have no enemy or pseudo-relationship, should immediately seek security, list the quantity of materials in detail, and send them to the office, and then submit them to the enemy and pseudo-property processing bureau for investigation and verification. There are currently 1,824 applications for unsealing, and there are still about 100 cases from other places that have not applied on time.

<p>"Minquan" Run Aground; Still Has Not Returned</p>
<p>The "Minquan" vessel of the Minsheng Company ran aground. In the morning (the 17th), it left the port at the same time as the "Jiangshun" vessel, heading for Yichang. On that day, because the wind was strong, the "Jiangshun" vessel, being large, was not affected and continued upstream. The "Minquan" vessel was small and did not dare to rush forward. At around 12:00 midnight (the 18th), near Nantong, due to unfamiliarity with the river channel, it sailed into shallow water and ran aground. It immediately telegraphed Shanghai to report the situation. On the 18th at noon, during high tide, the vessel could be moved, but unexpectedly ran aground again after the water receded. The company has prepared a tugboat, which will go this morning to tow it. On the one hand, it is hoped that the vessel will leave the shallow water on its own. It is also learned that this time, the vessel was only carrying 1,000 barrels of gasoline and only 51 passengers, and no commercial goods. The company's "Minyu" vessel has been repaired and moved to Wharf No. 3 on the Bund to dock. It is scheduled to depart directly from Shanghai to Chongqing tomorrow morning or on Saturday morning.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer Warns American Drivers</h3>

<h3>Real Estate of Traitors Transferred to Management by the Assets of Traitors Group</h3>
<p>Regarding the real estate of traitors, including officials of the Nanjing puppet government and members of the business community who were proven to have collaborated with the enemy, a large number of properties have been seized by the government since the victory. Although most of them have been transferred to the Management Group of the Enemy and Puppet Assets Administration, that group is only responsible for safekeeping. It is now known that the bureau has begun to hear cases of traitors, so it has specifically transferred all the files of traitors' real estate to the Assets of Traitors Group for continued management.</p>

Director Chen Shiquan personally presided over the meeting, stating:</p>
<p>"I am very honored to have everyone here today. The Land Administration Bureau has been working for nearly three months since it began its work. Regarding land matters and the points that citizens should pay attention to, I would like to give everyone a comprehensive report. I hope that everyone present will give us your unreserved advice. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the city's land administration was illegally disposed of by the enemy and puppet regime. Land registration was disordered, deeds were lost, and property rights became problematic. In particular, the properties of Allied nationals and many British and French registration deeds were changed to the eighth day registration. After the recovery, the bureau reorganized them in accordance with the land right clearing methods promulgated by the Central Government and established three major work guidelines: (1) to proceed with the handling in a peaceful and fair manner; (2) to handle legal property rights in the former concession areas in accordance with the central government's regulations; and (3) to adjust the distorted land rights disputes of Allied nationals in a fair position in accordance with reciprocal treaties.</p>
<p>Launch Land Surveying and Registration</p>
<p>As for all unregistered single slips and old deeds in Huangpu District (i.e., the former Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the French Concession Bureau), which are of great age, the bureau has dispatched 22 surveying staff teams to survey and map in detail. It was found that there are often discrepancies in the mu divisions in the deeds, so land surveying and mapping registration is extremely important. There are two meanings of this land registration: (1) In terms of the people, after applying for registration according to law, a land ownership certificate is issued, and the people's rights have absolute validity and are guaranteed. Moreover, the property certificate is also attached with a detailed map, which is very convenient for the owner. (2) In terms of the government, there are complete registers. After the entire registration, the investigation is convenient, which is of great benefit to the promotion of land administration.</p>
<p>The Chairman announced to the people on the Double Tenth Festival, one of which is land surveying and wealth registration. Therefore, land registration is a necessary procedure for investigating wealth, which is a kind of wealth registration and should be accelerated.</p>
<p>Registration Area Divided into Three Locations</p>
<p>As for the scope of registration, it is divided into three registration offices. The six districts are registered first, including Huangpu District (including the old Public Concession area and the old French Concession area), Zhabei District, Yinxiang District, Caojing District, Hunan District, and Fahua District. For the convenience of general owners, in addition to the General Bureau, three registration sub-bureaus are established: (1) No. 66 Zhapu Road, the first registration office, handles registration matters in the old Special First District (Huangpu), Zhabei, and Yinxiang Districts; (2) No. 71 Daxi Road, the second registration office, handles registration matters in the old Special Second District (Huangpu) Fahua District; (3) No. 72 Shangwen Road, Nanshi, the third registration office, handles registration matters in Hunan and Caojing Districts.</p>
<p>I hope that citizens will actively go to register. Because the first registration is more complicated, in order to seek detailed information, two months are given for registration and receipt, that is, from November 19th to January 18th. On average, there are 220,000 mu of land in the six districts, with at least 300,000 households. After the registration is closed, another two months will be given for the announcement period, so that when others have objections after the owner registers, they can be corrected according to law. During the announcement period, registration can also be handled with flexibility, but a late registration fee must be paid. Owners who live in other places and cannot rush to register can state their normal reasons and be allowed to make up for the registration. If the land practice certificate issued 26 years ago has no disputes, they can come to the bureau to exchange it, so as to simplify and expedite the process. In short, unless there are special circumstances, it will be handled as soon as possible. Please don't doubt it, this is a necessary process, I want to declare this.</p>
<p>Certificates Issued by the Enemy and Puppet Regime are Invalid</p>
<p>All land rights registrations made by enemy and puppet organizations during the fall of this city and the land rights certificates issued by them are invalid; however, if the public freely buys and sells, if it is a legitimate transaction, the property certificate is still considered valid. If coercive behavior is used, the government will fully protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people.</p>
<p>Foreign merchants' road changes to Japanese, or transfers and sales, shall be protected in accordance with the law and corrected and returned. As for Chinese citizens who have their own property certificates and foreign merchants who have powers of attorney, the Bureau will implement land ownership registration in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations for all land consolidation matters, treating Chinese and foreign nationals equally, and the land ownership certificates will be valid and will be issued by the Tian Bureau in succession.</p>
<p>Regarding the exchange of land ownership certificates, they will be returned to the owner after the owner applies for registration with the registration office. At present, the measurement of all six districts in the first phase has been mostly completed, and the transfer of changes is relatively easy. The time for the first registration outside the six districts may not be enough, and a notice will be issued after the six districts have been handled. However, people can still go to the General Bureau to handle transfers and changes at any time. If property certificates outside the six districts are lost, they can apply to the General Bureau at any time. Cases of unclear boundaries will also be cleared and re-mapped in order.</p>
<p>Handling Enemy and Puppet Use of Land</p>
<p>Land used by the enemy and puppet regime, such as land in Jiangwan, Dachang, Wusong, Longhua, and other areas, that was forcibly occupied without payment of compensation, and that is not actually needed by our central government, can be fairly returned. All past folk farms, etc., will be returned as much as possible. I have talked with the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau about this matter, and it can be done. Regarding registration fees, Jiangsu Province used to be responsible for collecting measurement fees in the past in the field tax, but field tax is not responsible; however, the cost of printing in the country is quite large. At this time of financial difficulty, I hope that citizens will assist for their own property rights. As for the fee standard, those who apply for the first land ownership certificate registration will be charged 4/1000 of the declared land price, and those who apply for land rights acquisition, setting, transfer, change, and cancellation registration will be charged 2/1000 of the right value. The contract tax is relatively high, from 6% to 15%. This income belongs to the national treasury and is collected and remitted by the bureau on behalf of the treasury. According to the general principles of the Land Law, it is not necessary to pay deed tax after land consolidation and registration. This point is also very important, and I hope that all sectors will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Freely Declare Registered Land Prices</p>
<p>The bureau hopes that owners will not declare the land price too low when declaring land value-added tax. If there is no sale after five years, it will be re-evaluated. This value-added tax is a natural trend of urban prosperity and is not obtained by people's labor, that is, it also contains the meaning of equal land rights. Therefore, the government taxes it quite highly. If the declared land price is 2 million per mu now, and the land price increases to 3 million after 15 years, that is, the land price increases by 50%, the government will levy a value-added tax of 20%. Therefore, if the land owner declares a low land price, the land price will rise sharply after 15 years, and the tax will be higher, which is a loss. On the contrary, if the selling price of the real estate exceeds the declared value, tax must also be levied, but the value-added tax fee shall be borne by the buyer. It is hoped that the owners can freely declare the value of the land at the level line. At the same time, the Bureau also adopts the land price register occupied by the Public Works Bureau and the puppet organization in the 30th year as reference material.</p>
<p>It was found that the various registration offices handled land registration not more than 200 households per office per day last month, and it is estimated that there are 300,000 households, which seems too slow. It is hoped that the owners will register as soon as possible and do not hold on to wait and see. In short, the Bureau is actively serving the people in an extremely complex manner. The people can view and copy volumes at the Bureau for free, and all registration offices will give them the greatest convenience. If there are inquiries, they will answer them as much as possible. If the boundaries are unclear, and measurement is required, if the staff's attitude is bad, or if there is corruption, the people can report and report it; once verified, they will be severely punished. If you have any good ideas, you can say them orally or in writing, and I am very willing to accept them," he said.</p>
<p>Subsequently, representatives from all walks of life successively raised questions about registration security and taxation. Director Chen answered them one by one, and the discussion was very lively. It did not end until 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Factories That Moved to Sichuan Hold a Meeting in Shanghai; Appeal to the Government for Relief</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper) The Shanghai office of the United Association of Factories Moved to Sichuan and Guangxi held a meeting at its office on East Seward Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, inviting 62 member units of the association to Shanghai to attend the meeting, and invited envoys Ye and Niu to attend and make a request. Envoy Ye did not arrive due to official business, but Envoy Niu Tixing arrived accompanied by Xue Mingjian, a representative of the association and a senator. More than 70 people attended, including representatives of the association's units in Shanghai, Liu Hongsheng, Yan Yaoqiu, Zhou Jinshui, and reporters from various newspapers. The atmosphere at the meeting was generous and warm, and from the speeches of the representatives, we can further understand the current situation of the factories in the inland. Here is a brief record of what happened:</p>
<p>Seven Requests</p>
<p>First, Yan Yaoqiu, Chairman of the Association, put forward seven requests to Envoy Niu, hoping that they could be forwarded to the central government. The contents were: (1) To allocate enemy and puppet factories quickly to facilitate production; (2) To implement low-interest loans; (3) To advance compensation to help resume work, because the factories that moved inland during the war suffered extremely heavy losses. For example, the Huacheng Electric Appliance Factory lost 890,000 yuan in legal currency during the Xianggui War last year. Although this loss can be claimed from the enemy in the future, the government should first advance a part of this compensation to help with turnover and encourage loyalty. (4) To exempt taxes for one year, as in the case of farmers who are exempt from field tax for one year. (5) To assist technical workers in the rear to come to Shanghai to resume work, because the black market ticket price from Chongqing to Shanghai has been sold at a frightening price of 400,000 yuan in legal currency. Technical workers cannot come. (6) Some of the machines in the inland factories can still be used. Please help the government with transportation. (7) Please improve the factory administration and protect the peaceful workers. The request was signed by members of the Association in Shanghai and submitted to Envoy Niu in writing.</p>
<p>Difficulties of Factories</p>
<p>Then, the members expressed their opinions separately, and the words of Zhou Jinshui of Huacheng Electric Appliance Factory were the most painful, moving the whole venue. Zhou said that when Hua or moved inland from Shanghai, there were more than 1,000 tons of machines. During the Xianggui War, only 875 tons were left. After reaching Liuzhou, the QianGui Road was blocked and there was no way to transport them. 22 workers died and 6 were missing. As for the remaining materials, they had to destroy them themselves and ask the Allied forces to bomb them. After Zhou and his party traveled to Chongqing, the Ministry of Economic Affairs lent them 75 million yuan, instructing them to resume work. Unexpectedly, after resuming work, victory came, and the government no longer ordered goods from the factories. The factories had to stop work, and Huacheng was no exception. The total loss reached 890,000 yuan in legal currency. He personally went bankrupt and could not repay the government's debt, and the interest on the government's debt reached 3 minutes and 4 cents. If this continues, he will be imprisoned for debt. His only hope is "Please distinguish between those who love the country and those who do not." Wu Gengmei said that when the factories moved inland, they never considered success or failure. He also said that the exchange rate had not been set, and how could the bidding price be set? Their hope was to be able to manage the enemy and puppet factories on behalf of the government. Liu Hongsheng also said that the bidding method only provides Shanghai merchants who make a fortune from national disasters with new opportunities to make a fortune. He also said that factories in Shanghai have been closed for three months, 200,000 workers have lost their jobs, and the losses are huge.</p>
<p>Niu's Statement</p>
<p>Envoy Niu then stood up to express his sympathy, saying that because victory came suddenly, everything was very hasty, and there were not enough people, so there were inevitable facts that were not satisfactory. "The people's losses are not exhausted, and the government's pain is also not exhausted." The government not only wants to recover the hearts of the people, but also wants to know the people's suffering, and wants everyone to speak freely, so that in the future, in addition to the constitutional draft, it can also formulate political programs and policies. He also asked everyone to submit written proposals as "certificates" for the envoy's report. Finally, Xue Mingjian said, "The people will never compete with the country for profits, but the government must also be clear." The meeting ended at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>International Radio Station Transmits and Receives; Direct Telegraphs Between China and France</h3>
<p>According to transportation sources, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation has resumed operations in Shanghai. It has successively opened direct international wireless circuits with China and the United States, China and the United Kingdom, China and Switzerland, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and Shanghai and Macao, as well as news circuits between China and the United States and China and the Philippines. In order to facilitate communication between China and France, the station has added a direct international wireless circuit between China and France from the 19th of this month. It uses high-speed automatic machines day and night to communicate with Paris, the capital of France, and is extremely smooth. All sectors can send telegrams directly to the business office of the International Radio Station at No. 70 Fuzhou Road.</p>
<h3>New Exchange Rate to Be Determined; Still Under Study</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Our reporter visited a responsible official of the Central Bank yesterday to inquire about the rumor that the exchange rate would be announced soon. It is said that the new exchange rate should not be too low, so as not to affect domestic industry and commerce, but it should not be too high. Moreover, the new exchange rate must take into account the domestic economic situation, the issuance of banknotes in various places, the price situation, and the economic trends of various countries in the world. Only after comprehensive investigation and research can a final decision be made. He firmly believes that the responsible authorities of the government are actively studying it. The reason for the delay in the announcement is also sufficient proof that the problem is too complicated, and a new exchange rate that takes into account all aspects cannot be determined without careful study, comprehensive planning, and delimitation.</p>
<h3>Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Governor Sets Up News Committee</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Shanghai Branch, in view of the fact that the news released by each agency sometimes has unclear boundaries and technical aspects that are not perfect, have decided to establish a joint news committee to coordinate news releases. Meetings are held twice every Wednesday and Saturday. The committee has three members: the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has appointed Mark Alusituo, the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has appointed Shen Weitai, and the Shanghai Branch has appointed Wang Renyi. Shen Weitai will serve as the chairman of the committee, and Gu Liang, the chief of the news section of the Shanghai Branch, will serve as the secretary of the committee concurrently.</p>
<h3>Murderer of American Pilot, Kaburaki, Escorted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kaburaki Masao, the first war criminal who murdered an American pilot and former Chief of Staff of the 34th Army of Japan, is scheduled to be extradited here from Tokyo today.</p>
<p>MacArthur's Nephew Responsible for Escorting</p>
<p>Lieutenant MacArthur, the nephew of General MacArthur, is responsible for escorting the criminal to Shanghai. Lieutenant MacArthur is also a staff member of the War Crimes Trial Committee here. He went to Tokyo on the 17th and will return with instructions from General MacArthur for use as a reference in the trial of war criminals.</p>
<h3>Non-Main Roads in This City Will Be Renamed</h3>
<p>According to a responsible person in the municipal government, after the main roads' names have been rectified, the municipal public works bureau is considering the rectification of the names of the branch roads. During the puppet organization era, the road names that were rectified were quite unreasonable. This last rectification of the road names will be announced before the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Murder Case Cracked; Murderer Yoshisaka Caught</h3>
<p>A case of a Japanese man killing our compatriot Chen Shunsheng was cracked in the Hongkou District of this city the night before last. The murderer, Yoshisaka Yukitomo, a Kumamoto native (34 years old), has been captured. He will be transferred by the North Sichuan Road Police Station to the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Local Court for investigation and prosecution. The victim, Chen Shunsheng (54 years old, from Pudong, a carpenter of the former "China Central Water and Electricity Company," residing at No. 42, Lane 304, Dongjiaxing Road), was fatally struck in the head with a pickaxe by Yoshisaka on the morning of August 8. His son then filed a complaint with the police station to arrest the murderer. The murderer, Yoshisaka Yukitomo, moved repeatedly, and the search was fruitless. It was not until the week before last that he was found to be hiding under the name Sasaki. At 9:30 the night before last, personnel from the Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Office, together with military police and the victim's son Chen Sigeng, went to capture Yoshisaka Yukitomo and detain him.</p>
<h3>Local Association Tea Party to Welcome Hong Lanyou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association held a tea party at the association at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to welcome Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Due to poor health, President Du Yuesheng commissioned Wang Xiaolai to represent him. After the chairman delivered a welcoming speech, Vice Minister Hong stood up to give instructions, and Wang Xiaolai gave a speech of thanks before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wireless Registration Deadline Extended</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The registration of wireless, wireless stations, and wireless equipment in this city, which was announced by the Songhu Garrison Command to expire at the end of this month, has been extended because the Telecommunications Supervision Section of the Department is too small and the workload is insufficient. The deadline will be determined after a new location is found.</p>
<h3>Transportation Vehicles Arrive in Shanghai; $2,000 USD Per Vehicle</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration transported 250 transportation vehicles yesterday, and the installation can begin immediately. Once completed, they can be purchased by various transportation companies. It is said that they will be sold at the original price of the vehicles, which is $2,000 USD per vehicle. Although an application must be submitted first, after investigation, it can be approved only if it is found to be truly beneficial to transportation.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Daji Road, Nanshi</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Five thugs, all armed with handguns, suddenly came to the home of Sun Linshu at No. 2 Yongqingli, Daji Road, Nanshi, at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. They robbed him of 1.5 million yuan in legal currency and fled with the stolen goods. Afterwards, the principal reported to the Penglai Branch Bureau in charge for self-arrest.</p>
<h3>Commander of U.S. Air Force, Hackingberger, Returned to the United States Yesterday; All Work of the Tenth Air Force Completed</h3>
<p>General Hackingberger, commander of the Tenth Air Force, known as the "Wilderness Air Force," left here yesterday to return to the United States. All the work of the Tenth Air Force has also been completed. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, General Hackingberger flew from California to Hawaii in the United States, making a non-stop flight, setting a new epoch in aviation history. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, he served in the Pacific and fought to the death with the Japanese in the air. In early 1945, he came to China and first served as the Chief of Staff of General Chennault, Commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, and later succeeded General Davidson as the Commander of the Tenth Air Force. This Air Force fought in the India-Burma theater. After the end of the war, it made great contributions to the work of the Chinese Air Force in transporting troops to various recovery areas. It air-transported 81,000 of our troops and 712 units to the Dongjiu provinces, coastal areas, and Vietnam and other recovery areas in 49 days. At the same time, it air-transported a portion of the U.S. military back to the United States.</p>
<h3>City Police Department: Several Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>In recent days, several robbery cases have occurred in this city. The police department has been conducting rigorous investigations. As a result, in addition to the Taishan Road Branch quickly solving a major case, the Criminal Division of the General Bureau has also solved two cases in recent days. One involved the arrest of Zhou Xuelong and eight others inside the Imperial Palace Hotel on Zhejiang Road, along with a batch of weapons. These criminals have a long history of offenses. According to their confession, they have repeatedly robbed Mr. Jin at No. 9 Huimin Road, Mr. Xu at No. 149 Yuezhou Road, and five other locations. The other case involved the arrest of four criminals, including Shen Fenghao, at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Tianjin Road. They confessed to robbing ships carrying longans and soybeans on the Huangpu River. Furthermore, the Water Police Branch also arrested eight criminals, including Huang Yuanyi, for robbing ships on the Huangpu River, along with numerous weapons and stolen goods. The investigation is currently ongoing.</p>
<h3>Postal Service with Japan and Korea Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Regarding the resumption of postal services with Japan and Korea, which concerns international laws, our country's postal authorities have submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation for instructions. Yesterday, an order was received stating that since our country is at war with Japan and has severed diplomatic relations, postal services with Japan should not be resumed. The troops of the United States and the Soviet Union are currently occupying the northern and southern parts of Korea, and transportation has not yet been restored. Before the situation becomes clearer, it is difficult to resume postal services. The matter should be reconsidered after military liaison officers and diplomatic specialists are sent to Korea, and when the opportunity for resuming postal services arises.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wei Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing to Inspect Sanitary Conditions</h3>
<p>Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Committee of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday to specifically promote sanitation work in the city. Zhang's first step will be to inspect the sanitation conditions of various hospitals and charitable organizations in Shanghai, as well as the supply of medicines.</p>
<h3>Unified Freight Rates and Fares to Be Implemented Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association Reorganization Committee, established on the 16th of last month, has formulated interim regulations for the reorganization of the association, as well as a work plan consisting of seventeen essential points. It has begun the process of receiving and reorganizing all public funds, assets, deeds, and other files of the original association and the puppet association, and registering members. More than half of the 50+ privately-owned shipping companies in the city have already joined. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company remains a member. After a certain period, qualifications will be reviewed, and registration certificates will be issued upon approval from the Bureau of Social Affairs. Furthermore, for the study of important issues and military transport, the committee has formed five subcommittees: (1) Industry Cooperation Committee, chaired by Yang Guanbei, to study joint operations, joint procurement of materials, and other issues related to industry cooperation. (2) Rate Committee, chaired by Hu Shiyuan, to study and stipulate standards for freight and passenger rates and vessel charter prices, and to negotiate freight rates for various routes. (3) Shipping Document Unification Committee, chaired by Wei Wenda, to study and design the unification of or clauses for shipping orders, bills of lading, manifests, storage receipts, passenger tickets, charter contracts, and other documents, and to formulate standard freight and passenger procedures and charts. (4) Accounting Unification Committee, chaired by Li Yunliang, to study and design a unified accounting system for the shipping industry, including accounting subjects and bookkeeping procedures. (5) Shipwreck Compensation Committee, chaired by Qian Xinzhi, to investigate shipwreck losses and seek government compensation for various matters. The Rate Committee, for the purpose of unifying freight rates and fares, has already negotiated various price lists, originally scheduled to be implemented on New Year's Day next year. It is now learned that the freight rates and passenger ticket prices of various companies are extremely chaotic, which greatly hinders the shipping industry. Therefore, it has been decided to advance the implementation to tomorrow (the 21st), and the price lists have been distributed to various companies, which must adhere to the association's fixed prices and are not allowed to increase or decrease them arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>British Red Cross Society Holds Christmas Party for Children</h3>
<p>British News Agency reports that the British Red Cross Society is holding several Christmas parties to entertain children under the age of fourteen who have been released from detention camps in the Shanghai area. The first party was held yesterday at the Riverside Apartments. The second party will be held on the 21st of this month. The third and fourth parties will be held on the 22nd at Lincoln Road and the British Refugee Camp. Children from Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have received invitations. All children attending the party will receive gifts, and the society is making every effort to ensure that these children have the best possible Christmas party.</p>
<h3>City Briefs</h3>
<p>After the victory, the Northeast Native Place Association was initiated by Ding Guitang and others. They temporarily borrowed the Yanping Guild Hall and Room 221 of the Hardoon Building to register fellow villagers and scheduled a founding assembly on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>The City Defense Corps convened its first corps affairs meeting at the corps headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday, resolving multiple important cases. It is reported that they have decided to prioritize the deployment of veteran members for duty, tentatively from 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM the next day, to assist the military and police in maintaining public order. If necessary, the duty hours can be extended to 6:00 AM the next day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Diplomacy Association sent a telegram to General Marshall, the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, yesterday, expressing their welcome.</p>
<p>The pilot who crashed a P-38 fighter plane at Jiangwan Airport the other day was sent to the hospital but died due to severe injuries.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The Apelia anticyclone, after concentrating over this city, has gradually moved eastward. Another large anticyclone has formed over Lake Baikal.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Over the Yellow Sea, clear and cold, with fog, a very mild westerly wind turning north. Over this city, clear and relatively mild, with fog in the morning, easterly wind turning to variable light breeze. Over the East Sea: Clear, partly cloudy, mild northerly wind turning east, morning fog along the Chinese coast.</p>
<p>Yesterday's temperature: highest 61.2, lowest 31.6.</p>
<h3>8,000 Tons of Relief Supplies Ready for Distribution</h3>
<p>Ten ships carrying relief supplies to China have arrived in Shanghai, totaling 8,000 tons. It is learned that the entire amount has been properly allocated, and the 15 branch offices of the Administration and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Executive Yuan will receive a considerable amount. They will soon be transported to various places using ships, railways, trucks, and other means of transportation, with the essential items for emergency relief in various places being shipped out first.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse into the Lives of Detained Nazi Party Members: A Visit to the German Refugee Camp</h3>
<p>— Mai Tian</p>
<p>Walking along Qimei Road in Jiangwan, you will forget the tall buildings you saw twenty minutes ago, as well as the crowded and chaotic scene on the streets. Qimei Road is lined with wide fields on both sides, with no houses, no stalls, and few people. In the distance, you can see a huge white building on the left, which is now the German refugee camp. It used to be a Japanese national elementary school. Four connected buildings, one of which is now home to two hundred followers of Hitler.</p>
<p>Among the two hundred German refugees detained, there are eighty-nine men, forty-eight women, and sixty-three children. They have formed their own committee, organized by five people, responsible for their own food, clothing, shelter, and other aspects of life. The chairman, Lundao, is a key figure in the minds of the Nazi Party and used to be a consultant to the German Consulate.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,300 Germans in Shanghai. The German Refugee Management Committee has divided them into three categories: (1) government personnel, including diplomats, propaganda personnel, and important Nazi Party members; (2) business personnel, including foreign company employees and technicians; and (3) residents, including priests, ministers, doctors, lawyers, and other self-employed individuals and residents. Those currently held in the refugee camp belong to the first category and those in the second and third categories who were devoted to the Nazis or engaged in activities detrimental to the United Nations during the enemy puppet era. The remaining Germans are instructed to obtain guarantees before temporarily staying in the city. The German Refugee Management Committee has reached an agreement with Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital and will soon order another two hundred Germans with relatively difficult living conditions to be concentrated there.</p>
<p>As for the Germans' property, houses, and furniture, some of it has been signed by the German property owners, lessees, and the German Refugee Management Committee and supplied to the municipal government agencies for use.</p>
<p>Stubborn Old Nazis</p>
<p>On the construction site of the refugee camp, the Germans funded the construction of a kitchen, which they reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of legal tender on over a month ago. It is quite spacious. At four o'clock, they were already preparing dinner. About ten German men and women were sitting in a circle peeling potatoes. Among them was an old man wearing a peaked cap and leather jacket, tall and large, who was Ramen, the leader of the Nazis in the Chinese region. This old fox, who had been influenced by Hitler's ideology for many years, was very stubborn and unwilling to casually tell reporters anything. When the reporter asked about his family, he said, "I have no family." Besides Ramen, there were several other Nazi figures who were once prominent, such as Erhardt, the former Nazi leader in Shanghai; Minato, a former professor at St. John's University; Cord, the former leader of the German intelligence group in Shanghai; Mostis, the former president of the Shanghai Haitong News Agency; Taussad, the former president of Baolong Hospital; and Hebert, an important member of the former German Embassy. Twenty-one classrooms of the former Japanese elementary school on the second floor have now been designated for them to live in. Each room is divided into several rooms, and each family has an area of two zhang long and one zhang wide, enclosed by cloth to form a small room. The furnishings inside are quite comfortable, with two small beds, two children's beds, and some furniture, so it is not too crowded. It is said that they are well organized and eat together. Each person spends five US dollars per month on food. They do their own laundry and clean their rooms. Several German men also took axes and were chopping tree roots on the lawn. They have no organized entertainment and at most play chess. They are required to get up at 7:00 every day, have breakfast at 8:00, roll call at 9:00, lunch at 12:00, dinner at 6:00, another roll call at 7:00, and go to bed at 9:00. They are not allowed to leave the room after 9:00. Gambling, quarreling, and making trouble are prohibited. The German Refugee Management Committee is responsible for the roll call. All men must sign at the office, while women and children are temporarily exempt from the roll call.</p>
<p>Innocent Children</p>
<p>Regarding medical care, German dentist Beckland and Dr. Haimen visit twice a week for treatment.</p>
<p>The German Refugee Management Committee currently has seven people managing everything in the camp, and the Garrison Headquarters has sent twenty guards to defend it.</p>
<p>Although these Nazi Party members have lost their freedom, considering their crimes, they believe that the treatment in the camp is very good. It is incomparable to the inhumane "dens of devils" of the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Before leaving the camp, I saw several German children playing in the courtyard. Two extremely adorable little girls were sitting on a stone sill, smiling innocently at us. I thought they might feel confused about being suddenly sent to such a desolate place, losing their interesting toys and lively places to go. Would they know whose gift it was? I feel wronged for those children.</p>
<p>The Japanese National Elementary School on Qimei Road has now been used as a refugee camp for the German refugees. These followers of Hitler and implementers of Nazism, although they have lost their freedom, are still living a daily life above the middle class. The detained German men are working in the courtyard, looking energetic, comfortable, and leisurely.</p>

<h3>Seeds of Several Thousand Years Sprout</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the "Archaeological Expedition" engaged in excavation work in the Chyor Lake District and Vologda Oblast of the Soviet Union discovered four ramie seeds on the Molodna River. After careful examination by many experts, it was proven that they had been buried underground for several thousand years and have only recently sprouted and branched. Soviet scientists will try to cultivate new seeds from these seeds.</p>
<p>This seems like a scientific miracle. Seeds from thousands of years ago, buried underground, can sprout and branch out today, thousands of years later. After such a long era, the strata have undergone countless changes, but the seeds that were originally sown have not been submerged by the ancient years. I think that the person who originally planted the seeds, even his bones may have long rotted into soil. How could he have imagined that they would be discovered by archaeologists thousands of years later?</p>
<p>The great British thinker Spencer once said, "A pebble can change the earth." This means that one should not underestimate the minuteness of a pebble, because a pebble is always a kind of "matter," and "matter," whether large or small, can change the world. The physicist's so-called "conservation of matter" also illustrates that any kind of "matter" can produce various changes in the space it occupies, and these changes will have various different impacts on our world and humanity. Looking at the importance of atoms and electrons in today's human life, it is not difficult to understand the principle of "conservation of matter."</p>
<p>Seeds of several thousand years can sprout and branch out. According to the comprehensive research of botanists and chemists from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, it is not a cosmic miracle. In the past, many scholars have studied this issue, and the conclusion is that it is 73.6% possible. Future research may increase the percentage of possibility. Furthermore, using the principle of "conservation of matter" to explain it, the seeds planted thousands of years ago will of course try their best to sprout and branch out in the years to come, although thousands of years is a very long era that may sometimes surprise us.</p>
<p>From this fact, we can derive two great inspirations: one is that we humans in this vast world should not underestimate the power of our individual selves. Although individual power is small, it can affect the entire world and involve all of humanity. This is a fact. The seed that was originally sown, after undergoing several years of changes and evolution in the strata, can be left to future generations for the cultivation of new seeds. At the same time, it can allow people to trace back to a desolate era in ancient times and generate the two concepts and feelings that "history is evolving" and "historical development is cumulative." I think that some revolutionary ideas initially disseminated by a revolutionary, even if they are only bits and pieces, will eventually merge into the mainstream of the revolution. Tracing back to the revolutionary ideas disseminated by the predecessors, we feel that they have immortal achievements. Even if the impact was very small at the time, society is actually changing imperceptibly because of it, just like seeds of several thousand years slowly growing underground.</p>
<p>A person lives in the world for only a few decades. The survival and continuity of the "small self" must rely on the power of the "big self." In other words, we do not live for ourselves, but for society and for all of humanity. If we want to hope that the "small self" is immortal, we can only expand the "small self" into the "big self." We should think more for others and not only care about our own interests. We should contribute as much power as we have. We must do our best to do things that benefit others, and our work attitude must transcend "selfishness" and not care about future rewards or seek praise from others. We must adhere to the concept of "do one thing for every ounce of strength, and give one ounce of light for every ounce of heat." If we cannot do a grand and earth-shattering undertaking, we should also learn from the sower of several thousand years ago, sowing seeds and leaving them for future generations to cultivate new seeds, continuing forever without interruption, and giving scientists some valuable research data. Our ancient China has always had a popular saying, "The predecessors plant the trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade," which is very correct when said positively. Unfortunately, this sentence has long become a kind of irony, teaching people to be "clever," teaching people to "not interfere," and teaching people to "only plan for themselves." If this bad attitude towards life is not eliminated as soon as possible, even if individuals live in the world for hundreds or thousands of years, they will still rot with their own corpses. If we want to hope that our "spirit" does not rot with our corpses, we should expand the "small self" view of life into the "big self" view of life.</p>
<p>The second inspiration is: history is a mirror, and no one can violate the rules of history. You reap what you sow. The law of cause and effect does not allow people to reverse it casually. Berkeley said, "See a world in a grain of sand." Although sand is minute, its impact and changes on creating a world are certain and unchangeable. The evil consequences suffered by the two invading leaders in the East and West eight years ago are precisely due to the "evil causes" they created. They no longer dare to do evil in the face of justice. They have already bowed their heads in front of the mirror of history. This is the condemnation and punishment they deserve.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we should not underestimate the power of our individual selves. Although our power is small, expanding from the "small self" to the "big self" is enough to influence our world. At the same time, we must cherish the fact that every one of our actions can have a great impact on future generations and society. Mr. Hu Shih said in an article that a person accidentally spat on the road, and this sputum contained countless tuberculosis germs, which spread and infected all the residents of the city with tuberculosis. This sounds unlikely, but it is actually very possible. If the four seeds recently discovered in the Soviet Union can be slowly cultivated into new seeds, then the reproduction rate of ramie will never decrease. Our nation, in the process of nation-building, also needs countless people to transcend the concept of "selfishness" and sow the seeds of shining the light and heat of the nation for future generations. Decades later, hundreds of years later, thousands of years later, our descendants can enjoy endless happiness, which would be so meaningful!</p>

<h3>Mr. Xu Zhen, Chairman of Liaoning</h3>
<p>— Xuetao</p>
<p>Due to the improvement of the situation in the Northeast, Mr. Xu Zhen, the chairman of the Liaoning provincial government sent by the central government to take over Liaoning, also took a plane north a few days ago.</p>
<p>Among the senior officials sent to take over the Northeast, Mr. Xu Zhen, the chairman of the provincial government, is also one of the youngest, besides the diplomatic specialist Mr. Jiang Jingguo. He is only in his early forties this year, but he has already shouldered the heavy responsibility of being the head of a province. This is also a rare achievement among the provincial chairmen across the country.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Mr. Xu Zhen, I think everyone will not be very unfamiliar with him, because he served as the administrative inspector of the Sixth District of Zhejiang, and was later promoted to the director of education of the neighboring province of Fujian. Since Japan's surrender, he has jumped to become the chairman of Liaoning Province. In these short years, he has been promoted from commissioner to director, and from director to provincial chairman, which can be described as a "meteoric rise" of a popular figure. However, there is absolutely no chance of luck in this, because this kind of leapfrog promotion is not something that people who are eager for advancement can hope to achieve. If you don't believe it, let's take a look at a period of his history:</p>
<p>Mr. Xu is a native of Shenyang, Liaoning. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), he was still serving as the director of the municipal telegraph bureau in Harbin. When the "September 18th" Incident broke out, most of the large and small institutions in the Northeast were lost. Some officials were arrested and imprisoned, and some supervisors took the opportunity to abscond. The chaos was truly heartbreaking. But our director of the municipal telegraph bureau, Mr. Xu Zhen, took 200,000 yuan of public funds and traveled to Nanjing, where he met with Minister Zhu Jiahua and explained all the public accounts clearly. Minister Zhu believed that in the chaotic situation and the shallow worldly atmosphere, it was rare to find such an upright gentleman, so he took him to meet with Chairman Chiang, who gave him encouragement. Later, he was appointed as the administrative inspector of the Sixth District of Zhejiang. The Sixth District was Chairman Chiang's hometown. During his eight years in office, the people praised his benevolent rule. In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), he was transferred to the director of education of Fujian, and made many achievements in education in the province of Min, especially the national language unification movement, which achieved great results. Recently, the central government appointed Mr. Xu as the chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government because the Northeast was recovered—this is Mr. Xu's political experience.</p>
<p>From this brief history, you can imagine what kind of honest, self-disciplined, and hardworking official Mr. Xu is. Compared with those officials who are only busy making national crisis money and enjoying the blessings of victory, they are of course not comparable. It is appropriate that the central government specially appointed Mr. Xu as the new administrative officer for the recovery of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Zhen is a Northeasterner who escaped from the "September 18th" era ten years ago. Now, he is being sent back to recover the lost territory, which is the most suitable candidate. We hope that Mr. Xu will not only recover the lost land of the Northeast for us, but more importantly, recover the hearts of the people of the Northeast for us!</p>

<h3>American War Dog Team</h3>
<p>— Tingjun</p>
<p>During this World War, the American army fully utilized war dogs. These dogs saved countless soldiers and achieved glorious feats.</p>
<p>In 1943 alone, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps trained more than 40,000 carefully selected war dogs. There were five training locations. Before training, each dog's personality and strengths were tested. Then, they were trained according to the work they were suited for. Among all the war dogs, 85 percent belonged to scout and attack dog teams, specially trained to detect concealed enemies and launch fierce attacks. Additionally, there were communication war dogs, who had to cross dense electrical grids to transmit messages and military maps to the rear. Patrol war dogs were tasked with patrolling the front lines or detecting concealed enemy troops when annihilating surrounded enemy forces. Rescue war dogs were tasked with finding wounded soldiers and reporting to the rear, so the rear could quickly dispatch people for rescue. Transport war dogs were tasked with using carts to transport military firearms and equipment to the front lines inaccessible to people. There were also supply war dogs, tasked with delivering water and food utensils through dangerous areas to various points on the front lines.</p>
<p>During training, military dogs prepared for combat received various enemy attack training. Upon seeing an enemy, they would pounce fiercely. Only military dogs serving in rescue and communication did not receive attack training. Rescue dogs carried a specially made leather stick on their collars. After discovering a wounded soldier, they would hold the stick in their mouths and run back to the rear. Upon seeing this signal, the rear would immediately dispatch a rescue team to follow them and find the wounded soldier.</p>
<p>Each war dog had a trainer specifically responsible for it, training it in various skills and responsible for feeding and caring for it. The first requirement for a war dog was to obey its master's orders. With one gesture, it would immediately rush towards the enemy, disregarding its own safety. With another command, it would immediately curl up on the ground, without moving at all.</p>
<p>The basic training period for war dogs was usually eight weeks. After training, some remained in the country to guard armories or military fortresses and patrol coastal areas, while most were transported overseas and assigned to various front lines for combat. The U.S. military called them the K-9 Corps, a military dog force.</p>
<p>These war dogs also achieved many accomplishments in various places. For example, a war dog guarding a certain armory in Boston discovered a spy trying to steal secrets and immediately held the spy down, refusing to let go until the guards arrived and arrested the spy. The spy was found with the entire plan to destroy the factory. During the landing in Sicily, a soldier advancing with a war dog was besieged by machine gun fire on the shore. In the midst of the crisis, the war dog suddenly rushed into the machine gun position. After a fierce battle, the machine gunner was bitten to death, and the other soldiers surrendered together. During the North African campaign, one night, a sentry was guarding with a war dog. The war dog suddenly tugged on the rope held by the sentry, and the sentry immediately notified the second line of sentries a few hundred yards away. This sentry hurriedly woke up the sleeping soldiers and repelled the sneak attack by the enemy. The war dog was able to detect enemy movements from 800 yards away. During the campaigns in the Southwest Pacific islands, the tropical areas were densely forested, and the swamps were hidden, making it even more difficult to spot enemy traces. They relied entirely on war dogs to save many soldiers and detect the Japanese army's hiding places. Their tactics indeed established indelible achievements.</p>
<p>Most war dogs were donated to the military by their owners. After they died in action, the Department of the Army had printed notifications sent to the dog owners: "Your war dog donated to this unit –––, has unfortunately died in action. May you find solace in remembering its heroic sacrifice for the country and slightly reduce your sorrow." Many war dogs died for their country. Recently, the American Legion has resolved to request the government to open public cemeteries and bury the war dogs who died in action in various units with military honors.</p>

<h3>Post-Mortem Birth</h3>
<p>— Shen Yikun</p>
<p>On December 8th, in Rockford, Illinois, USA, a full-term pregnant woman died of polio. Her baby was delivered thirteen minutes after her death. The child is a girl, is still alive, and is healthy.</p>
<p>Doctors say that although this baby girl's birth is very rare, she still has a chance to survive.</p>
<p>This little girl was delivered by Army Medical Corps Colonel Kerns. He said: "She is healthy and should develop and grow normally unless she contracts polio."</p>
<p>The baby girl weighs four pounds and fourteen ounces.</p>

<h3>Moving Houses</h3>
<p>— Baihua</p>
<p>An American engineering expert specializing in moving houses said: "If you want to move, but you can't bear to part with your current house, you can move with your house. Just install beams in the lower layer of the house, lift it up with a crane, put it on a vehicle, and with a turn of the wheels, the house will be moved away."</p>
<p>However, this type of house moving is not suitable for small buildings. It is best to move hospitals, churches, office buildings, and apartments, etc. Moving these large buildings from their old foundations to new foundations takes six months to a year.</p>
<p>In Aberdeen, South Dakota, USA, there is a Lincoln Hospital that was moved to a new site one and a half miles away. This hospital is four stories high, 115 feet long, and 42 feet wide, with a net weight of 300 tons. The construction cost was $150,000, and moving it to the new site in the suburbs cost $75,000 – that is to say, half the money was saved.</p>
<p>There is a four-story apartment building that was moved back 20 feet because the street was being widened. All the tenants continued to live inside during the move.</p>
<p>Public buildings are often moved to save taxpayers' money. The Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University in Illinois was moved several hundred yards away, except for the telescope lenses. Most of the valuable instruments remained intact. Moving buildings can save money and preserve the traditional atmosphere of the buildings.</p>

<h3>Suspended Roofs</h3>
<p>— Xingju</p>
<p>American architects have recently devised a way to build a suspended roof, made of aluminum, using the principle of air pressure, without the need for pillars to support it, stably suspended in the air.</p>
<p>In the future, when you watch a ball game or listen to music, when you look up, you may see this kind of roof, gleaming brightly in the air. You don't have to be afraid, it won't fall down; it's held up by air, which is stronger than any steel pillar.</p>
<p>The roof is made of extremely thin aluminum sheets, and the edges around it are tightly connected to the walls. Inside the arena, many fans in the basement "inflate" the air, increasing the air pressure. You may feel strange: how can relying on air pressure alone make the roof suspended in the air without falling down? Because the aluminum sheet roof weighs only one and a half pounds per square foot, the air pressure inside the arena only needs to be 0.05 pounds per square inch more than the outside to stably hold the roof up. And people will not feel uncomfortable in that kind of air pressure, which is no different from the air pressure when the sun reappears after a heavy rain.</p>
<p>According to the architect's precise estimate, this kind of suspended roof will not collapse even in the event of a very severe storm. Using this smooth roof, the acoustics can be harmonized, the lighting can be improved, and what is most satisfactory is that because there are no ordinary pillars to support it, the audience can have unobstructed views, and leaving the arena can also reduce congestion.</p>

<h3>On Lung Disease Without Worry (3)</h3>
<p>China Health Care Association</p>
<p>(4) Conditioning and Nourishing are Palliative Treatments</p>
<p>(7) When to Conduct X-ray Examinations</p>
<p>All patients with progressive or open lung disease may have no symptoms of lung disease and no suffering, such as someone's brother, whose lung disease is already critical, and someone is also infected, but all his actions are as normal, with only some phlegm. After the brother's death, someone underwent X-ray photography, and both lungs were infiltrated and incurable. There are also a couple, the husband is ill, and the wife serves him for many years. At first, she does not feel sick. One day, the wife suddenly coughs up blood. After X-ray examination, there is a cavity in the lung. There are countless examples of this kind. Therefore, to prevent lung disease, X-ray examinations should be performed as early as possible, so as not to be destroyed by tuberculosis bacteria without knowing it. So when should X-ray examinations be performed? According to Dr. White Downing,</p>
<p>(A) Anyone suspected of having lung disease, regardless of whether they have pain or what the symptoms are, should undergo X-ray examination. (B) Anyone with respiratory disease that has not healed for more than three weeks should undergo X-ray examination. (C) Anyone who has frequently had respiratory diseases in recent years should undergo X-ray examination. (D) When doctors treat patients, if they belong to respiratory diseases, they should also use X-ray examination in addition to treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, we can draw a conclusion that it is wrong to immediately determine that the lungs are healthy without X-ray examination. In other words, lung health cannot be determined without X-ray examination. Therefore, to perform an accurate diagnosis of lung health, X-ray examination is essential, and X-ray photography is the most appropriate. Anyone who looks healthy but already has lung disease, or who has respiratory disease and is suspected of having lung disease, should be examined with X-rays immediately. This is of great importance to their personal health and the prevention and eradication of lung disease. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will promote it as much as possible, so as to achieve the great effect of eradicating tuberculosis.</p>
