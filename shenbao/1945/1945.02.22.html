<h3>日陸海部隊會師　馬尼刺敵被包圍　馬西格河兩岸繼續激戰中</h3>
<p>呂宋烏前綫二十一日中央社電在敵軍砲擊下，罵尼刺日軍守備隊，十八日衝擊敵軍之側背，與自東北殺入之日本陸軍新銳部隊，在馬尼刺之東方會師，刻下蝟集於馬尼刺下東之敵軍，已陷於日軍包圍中。馬尼刺過邊日軍之反攻，益趨激烈，守備馬尼刺之日軍陸海部隊，不全市內外據點，反復肉搏，於舊城內中央郵政局，菲律賓大學附近，演成激烈之肉搏戰。十八日晚，於賽馬塲附近，殺傷敵兵五十餘。侵入馬尼刺之敵，或據守殘存建築，或以土袋構築陳地，以防日軍之突擊，同時，自馬尼刺東北突擊敵軍側背之日軍新銳有力部隊，十九日夜以來，突入馬尼刺東北　之奎松市機塲，躍入敵軍中心，予以制壓。又向馬尼刺市北方十五公裏梅卡亞方面西進中之另現階段，十八日夕刻，於東北方之布運薩地方攻擊携有裝甲軍五輛之敵軍二百五十餘鹵獲品甚夥，予敵以潰滅打擊，大奏凱歌。另一南進中之新銳聯隊　，蹂躪敵戰車羣及砲兵陣地，或排除敵機之轟炸，自敵背突破，十八日終與馬吉列之日海軍部隊合流，結果與向馬尼刺北西　中之日軍，自東方及北方，有包圍敵軍情勢。</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　馬尼刺市內外戰鬥仍極爲猛烈，日軍死守據點，尤於巴西格河南岸伊特勒斯舊城內，據守西班牙時代之古城，不使敵軍接近一步，刻正繼續激戰中，因城內尙殘留多數未及避難之市民，故日軍於作戰時並對此加以保護。據二十日合衆電報稱：指揮攻擊伊特䦨勒斯之敵將克里斯威特少將，將對伊特蘭斯一帶加以焦土攻擊，彼當宣稱，因鹽於美軍在馬尼刺已喪失多數兵力，故已決定對奮成力加破壞攻擊。按伊特蘭勒斯，尙有西班牙時代之天主教堂，均爲市民避難住所，今美軍竟以兵員損失過多，而對此開始破壞攻擊，此種喪盡人道之舉動，實令人切齒。</p>
<h3>科列基多島血戰　日軍擊沉敵艦船各一艘</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫二十一日中央社電　馬尼刺日軍守備隊，毫不法懦，仍在與敵激戰，呂宋各地之其他精銳，亦與此呼應，猛烈掃蕩敵軍，現在之仁牙因　頭，連日有百數十艘敵船及許多艦船企圖增强陸上兵力，活動於仁牙因灣岸至各地之間，現正積極修造汽車公路，該處日軍部隊，十五日以來，於桑霍塞北方使敵流血甚多。科列基多島之敵軍雖受甚大損害，今仍繼續增派後援部隊，十八日復降下傘兵，隱於密林石岸間，時時來襲，該灣之小島周　雖僅五公里，然兩軍正爲此一島之得失演成熱烈血戰，駐守該鳥之日陸海軍精銳，迭次以準確之射擊及獨有之肉搏戰法，殺斃敵屍如山。某陸軍部隊，曾乘夜色蒼茫之際，擊沉敵戰艦運輸船各一艘。</p>
<h3>日空軍擊沉　敵潛艇一艘</h3>
<p>南太平洋日軍某基地二十一日中央社電　日航空部隊，曾於二十日在西南太平洋發見敵潛水艇一艘，加以猛攻，將其繫沉。</p>
<h3>呂宋島　日軍戰略</h3>
<p>軍事專家談</p>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電　今日外訊：馬尼刺市日軍發動攻勢，迭有進展，業已於該市東方會師，致侵人該市之美軍四面受敵，陷入重圍，記者頃訪問某軍事專家，叩讒呂宋島日軍戰略，據答如下：目敵軍於呂宋烏仁牙因灣方面登陸以來，敵軍攻擊中心點爲爲尼刺，蓋敵美之見解以爲馬尼刺爲菲島政治中心，攻佔馬尼刺實具有重大之政治意義，易言之，攻佔馬尼刺即爲佔領全菲律賓，然在軍略上言，馬尼刺僅爲菲律賓之一都市而已，日軍於罵尼刺僅駐守一小部分，在馬尼刺街市中，與侵入之美軍抵抗，大部軍力則退駐北方山岳地帶，誘敵深入，發動側面之出血戰略，時予敵軍以嚴重損害，蓋美軍於仁牙因灣登陸後，在戰略上應向正面攻擊，惟因日軍據守側面之山岳地帶，時予打擊，使登陸後之美軍有所牽制，不得不倚重於側面，正面乃無法發展，遲至今日，始得以二師團之兵力侵入馬尼刺市之一部，其在仁牙因灣附近之五師團兵力，因遭日軍側面攻擊，陷於進退維谷狀態，此時，予以致命傷害，此實爲日軍戰略上之成功，因之，英軍復於斯比潔巴打半島兩方面再度登陸，以岡挽回戰略上之失敗，二月十四日，呂宋島駐防日軍，遂向登陸美軍發動大規模政擊，現在呂宋鳥方面之敵軍登陸部隊，的十二三師團，而日守軍抱必勝決心，以一當十，奮勇殲敵，時予敵軍以側面掛害。</p>
<h3>滿協和會聲明</h3>
<p>新京二十日中央社電，滿協和會第四次全國會員大會，特對日本大政翼贊會及大東亞各國各地域之興亞團體發表聲明如次；當此戰局緊迫，大東亞十億民族總蹶起之秋，興亞團體之使命亦益重大，茲本會舉行第四次會員大會，全體會員決意向完逐戰爭途上邁進，茲特披瀝微衷，望貴會加以協力，並祝貴會努力奮鬥。</p>
<h3>硫磺島日軍猛擊燒毀敵戰車百輛　尼米資認損害漸增加</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　硫磺島東部日軍守備部隊，利用山險固守之陣地，猛攻敵軍，二十日夜十一時許，敢行逆襲南碼頭及南部部落方面之敵軍，予以痛擊後，將之擊退。其他方面，敵軍曾接近日軍主要陣地二百乃至三百英尺之地點，然經日軍之猛擊，故損失甚重，其攻勢已陷於停頓狀態，未有任何積極行動。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　硫磺島日軍守備部隊，截止二十日上午十時，已將敵軍登陸戰車三百輛中之一百餘輛予以燒毀，其中二十餘輛爲日軍中少尉所收獲之戰果，中少尉於十九日敵軍在該鳥南部開始登陸之際，即以連射砲敢行邀擊，專對敵戰車施以砲擊，結果焚毀其二十餘輛，中少尉於建立殊勳後，至二十日上午，卒於第一綫壯烈陣亡。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據大宮烏路透社電傳，二十日夜尼米資發表，硫磺鳥美國海軍人員損害，逐次增加，大意如次：登陸時，聯合軍方之損害輕徽，而由於日軍自洞穴潛人，以大砲及迫擊砲熾烈攻繫後，聯合軍之損害遂逐次增加。美聯社電亦稱：至登陸地點附近斜面數百洞穴當入發射之日軍砲火，極爲熾烈，美軍損害雖不盟眞相　但預測相當重大。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電據大富烏來電，美海軍的三萬名，分乘艦艇八百艘，在硫磺鳥登陸，刻正企圖建築並擴大沿岸之堡壘，該鳥日軍勇猛迎擊，戰事之激烈，遠較達拉瓦，帛硫兩鳥爲甚。合衆社前綫特派報告謂，美軍死傷慘重，此次登陸作戰較過去困難，戰事之給東，需長久時間及多量損失。又美聯社特派員稱：美第一舟艇隊以火箭彈八千枚，向海岸綫猛射後，始行登陸，全島籠罩於硝烟彈片之中。據另電稱：美軍之第一目標，似着重在摺鉢山機塲。</p>
<h3>敵機襲京　被擊落一架</h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電駐渝美空軍P51型機三架，於二十一日上午目西方侵入南京上空，在揚子江地區用機槍掃射後，即遁走，惟經地上防空部隊猛烈攻擊，在京都江心附近擊落敵機一架。又於下午有敵P38機一架，又竄入上空盤旋，移時即向北方遁走，我方無損害。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>物價評定與物資管理的聯擊性</h3>
<p>物價的評定，必須與物資的管理，相輔以行，才能發生實效。這是極明顯的事理。如果單單定物價，對於物資，並不規定有效方法，加以管理，那末所評定的物價，勢必成爲具文，無人甘願遵守，而且不肖吏員，反可以爲敲詐的工具。縱使嚴刑峻罰，認眞執行，而商人嗜利如命，也必都將物資設法藏匿，以待善價。終至店頭無貸應市，消費大衆的購求，反而發生困難。所以物價評定，同時必須管理物資，這是萬萬不可偏廢的。</p>
<p>經濟當局，爲安定民生起見，早已設置機關，評定物價了。但是歷來情形，評價自評價，黑市自黑市，兩者渺不相涉。甚至評價跟隨黑市而上漲，一步一趨，又何貴乎有此評價。常局者也早已有見及此，於是屢有評價必先管理物資的議論。不過因爲管理物資，權力有所不逮，方法也難周密，遂至濺論紛紜，而迄未見諸實行</p>
<p>或謂從前評價，未見實效，乃是始終未曾嚴厲執行之故。若果嚴厲執行，必可取得相當效果，此說也不盡然。大抵新施評價制度之際，也必嚴令商人，把店頭陳列的貨品，須照評價出售。這就是把店頭陳列的貨品，同時加以管理，所以對於店頭陳列的貨品，雖可一時發生評價的實效。不過該貨品數量，極爲有限，一俟店頭無貨，牠的評價，也就失效，實難於繼統持久。</p>
<p>我們認爲管理物資，必須將民間所儲藏的同種物資，全部或大部份，加以管理，才可達到目的。農產品是散在廣闊的鄕間的，原非待牠集中之後，不易管理。所以農產品的統制方法，必須先扶助原有機構的收集，促進有徑路集中，然後才容易管理。而現在的統制方法，乃是破壞原有機構，阻塞原有的徑路，專憑統制機構，委派新人，獨占收買，這眞是無益有害，事倍功半。至於裂造品的生產，原是集中於都市，牠的管理，較爲容易，試把從前紗布收買爲例，就可明瞭。不過紗布收買之後，被收買者都感到痛苦，如果現在忽有登記某種物資之命令，商人自將疑爲又要收買，勢必脫逃取巧，阻礙較多。倘在登記之時，就聲明只是管理，決不收買，而管理中的出賣，也定明從優作價，務使被管理者，不受損害，且可獲得利潤，這樣開始管理，自然阻力減少，就可順利進行。</p>
<p>現在談到物資管理方法，一般人都注於業外人的囤積，以爲應該叫他們趕緊轉賣於業中人。殊不知現在的大囤戶，都已掛起業中人的招牌了。所以管理物資的方法，除取締業外人囤積外，同時必須就批發商原有及由業外人買得的物資總量內，每期應該保存若干，配賣與零售商若干，及如何作價，零售商原有及由批發商買得的物資總量的，每期應該保存若干，配賣與消費大衆若干，及如何作價，一一詳予規定。並設法防止零售商的減少配賣而流人黑市。果能如此，管理物資的目的，自然容易達到。而物價的評定，也能發生實效，這就證明管理物資與評定物價聯繫性的必要。</p>
<h3>渝方恐懼　日軍大攻勢</h3>
<p>里斯本廿一日中央社電　據重慶消息稱：何應欽十九日在昆明軍官學標准化第三期畢業典禮席上，曾陳述日軍之現狀，而謂日軍除在滿洲有關東軍外，並在中國大陸亦駐有大批軍隊，此等軍隊佈有衛禦美軍於中國沿岸登陸之陣勢，而渝軍新設總司令部於昆明者，亦爲防備日軍展開大攻勢云。</p>
<p>大陸決戰趨勢益緊</p>
<p>廣州廿一日中央社電觀諸大陸美陸軍渝軍及駐渝美空軍之共同作戰，大陸決戰之趨勢，頓形緊急，尤以美國地上軍及渝軍九十師之西南總反攻情勢，更應警戒。美陸軍自去年六月，即漸次移入大陸，該月下旬已將科學武器之機支部隊待機於重慶，旋更有以十生的七生的火砲爲主力之重砲全隊一團，戰車團對戰車砲部隊等，以及大型機輸入降落傘部隊，陸續集中於昆明附近，估計其總力的在三萬以上，輜重部隊均配備於西南前綫，一部已進抵西安，傳企圖向華北戰綫進攻，更調一部美式渝軍之緬甸遠征軍及在印渝軍，已集中於昆明周邊云。</p>
<h3>石渡任國務大臣　兼內閣書記長　津島壽一任大藏大臣</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日政府今次因廣瀨內閣書記官長之提出辭呈，刻已決意將人事一部更動，首先奏認石渡藏相爲國務大臣兼任內閣書記官長，後任藏相已　　　發總裁津島壽一氏　　，茲已由小磯首相於二十一日下午五時半進宮奏呈大皇，並於下午七時半於宮中舉行親任式。</p>
<h3>史蒂威爾公路　運輸力薄弱</h3>
<p>廣東二十一日中央社電渝府對史蒂威爾公路之打通，乃抗戰之生命，大事宣傳。韶關陷落後，廣東西南部信宜縣發行之建國日報及中山日報，均揭載中央社密芝那特派員之長文，對史蒂威爾路作實地之報告，臚列悲觀見解，頗値注目，大意如次：據彼等見解，此路打通後，渝府僅能維持抗戰，仍不能實行反攻，其理由爲：（一）過去緬甸公路每月尙未能運輸二三萬噸，况此史蒂威爾公路，長達一千八百公里，其運轍自必困難。（二）印度方面之載重汽車爲數甚少。（三）新公路之打通，於民衆毫無貢獻，尤其在打通前，美國曾謂中印公路僅爲軍用，非爲中國民衆之利益而建設者，此語頗傷及渝方民衆感情云。</p>
<p>中央社滬訊　最近重慶各報論調，常宣傳稱：史蒂威爾公路業已開通，認此舉爲一九四四年重慶之唯一成功，呼籲美援渝物資定期運人，但成問題者爲貨車及路上各種設施等之運輸力，對東慶將引起如何結果，試加檢討。重慶自宣傳史蒂威爾公路打通以來，同時頻頻宜稱設立醫院等，以資證明公路業已打通之事實，但據勃里根頓云「萊多公路之運輸，因係賴中國自力，故受限制，不能發揮」，於此亦可暴露萊多公路之機能矣。</p>
<p>依賴敵美顯見失策</p>
<p>此次日軍大陸縱貫作戰所奠定之戰略態勢，對於該公路終點昆明，以及重慶的門戶貴陽西安，隨時可以發揮攻勢，如屬必要，立即可遮斷其心臟部阻其接濟。屆時彼等所殘存者，唯有印度與成都間之航空運輸，以及西北公路之狹道，又被喜馬拉亞山峻嶮所阻之印度加爾各答與成都問之接濟路。但以上各路時受天時影響，而因B29型機之出擊，各路均負有重大接濟任務，蓋B29型機百架如全日出擊，則需燃料六萬六千加侖，幷需的三百架運輸機以運輸其燃料，如此即使月運抵二萬噸，亦不敷應用，此燃料分配，在渝美軍百分之九十，渝軍百分之十，如此重慶之不平，亦無法加以改盖，美軍目抵大陸後，接濟愈大，則對重慶之運輸量更被減少，又渝軍美國化，亦足表示在渝美軍人力資源之不足。美國現在太平洋專恃本國物量而戰，但彼等所高呼之大陸對日反攻，竟利用重慶人力，如此矛盾甚爲明顯。美國在大陸決戰中，對於强力的日本，係採取本國兵器重慶兵力之惡毒手段，重慶現猶渴望着援助物資，但結果唯有弱肉强食而已。</p>
<h3>北極海面　德雷擊隊　奇襲敵船團　船艦七艘擊沉三艘重損</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電德國社訊，據德元首行營發表：德雷擊機隊於下週二晟出奇襲攻由茂曼斯克駛返英國之敵方護送船團，而擊沉其輕巡洋艦一艘驅逐艦二艘及商輪七艘，計共五七·〇〇〇噸，尙有敵輪三艘（共一九·〇〇〇噸）亦恐因被炸受損，德機於低雲蔽天時作此奇襲，但僅損失二架。</p>
<h3>華北政會更迭　兩省市長官</h3>
<p>北平廿一日中央社電　華北政務委員會二十日舉行常務委員會，決定更迭冀·魯兩省長及北平·天津兩市長，許修直任北平特別市長，周迪平任天津特別市長，榮臻任河北省長，楊毓珣任山東省長。</p>
<h3>埃及政府　將有重大決定</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據路透社電稱，埃及政府二三日中將有重大決定，至於決定之內容究與日德有關，或與阿拉伯會議有關，現尙不易判明。</p>

<h3>南滙第六區攷察记</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>一月二十九日黎明，在東方魚狀將白的時分，起者冒着冷風，坐了隔日預　的人力軍，重踏上征途。這次的目的地，是南匯屬的召樓，事前因欲沿途參觀工廠，故採迂迴式的路線。中途除沿公路外，多羊腸小道，行人絕少，亦祗三五農婦，擔柴上鎭以求善價者。車上無事，與車夫一路問談，據稱彼係海門人，原爲農夫，奈目前鄕間苛雜過多，種田反有虧本之虞，故於一年前由鄉　田出走，來浦東操夫生涯。據稱進益最佳時（天雨之日），每日有近萬元之進款，平均侮日的六千元左右，目前因同行過多，有時亦有兩三日無一主顧者。約三刻鐘抵鶴沙鎭。</p>

<p>約三刻　抵鶴沙　。（按又名下沙）問諸路人，覓得素負盛名之大中華窰所在地。該窰規模頗大，廠址亦甚寬敞，雖不能與龍潭水泥廠相較，但在此窮鄕僻壤之小鎭如下沙者，有此雞羣鶴立之工廠，亦堪傲視餘輩矣。據　主少圻民，稱目下全廠工友約四百人，出品之瓦磚，亦分機製與土法兩種。前者事變前曾一度推銷海外，備受歡迎；後者除經銷本縣外，滬市亦爲主要銷塲，故在滬牛莊路設有該窰之分辦事處，經營出口及當地之推銷。奈戰事起後，銷路停滯，爲顧全多年服務之工友等生活起見，故今兼營製造麵粉，以資彌補一二，成績尙差強人意云。</p>
<p>記者離下沙，即往航頭鎭，兩地相距的三里。該鎭面臨閘港，西出黃浦江，東通新塲，爲南匯縣南部唯一交通水路，前此本有汽船直放上海，現已停駛。港口有滬閔輪間日信徒載客，背後即周南公路，交通尙稱便利灰　，則爲南匯縣區獨一無二者。該　計有工人三十餘人，其原料係採取焦石靑石加以燒鍊而成，全邑建築所用之石灰，均爲該窰所供給。據窰主張芹伯語，該廠營業額年的千萬餘元，蓋以目下石灰市價飛漲，每擔數近二千，與戰前每擔大洋六角較，相去何止千里矣。</p>
<p>召樓概況</p>
<p>由航頭折向召樓，頗有一段路程，到達時已過午刻。</p>
<p>按召樓爲南匯縣第六區之首鎭，商業未見繁榮，但該處經紳門第極多。其區界南隣奉腎，西靠浦江，北爲南匯商業鈕組之周浦所屬，東爲七區新塲所管轄。全區分十二鄕鎭，人口的六萬，商業頗見蕭條。當地之金融機構僅有小型當舖多家而已。物價則較他區爲廉，居民泰半爲農民，以小農爲多數，中又以半自耕農最多，自耕農佃農决之，而大地主則絕少。其農產物以稻麥爲大宗，雜糧菜蔬次之、閔港附近農家皆操製蒲包之副業，出品精良，爲他處農民所樂用。</p>
<p>教育發達</p>
<p>全區敎育頗爲發達，計有完全小學五所，初級小學二十餘所，學生三千人。至敎員之待遇則爲南匯之冠，因當地之各鄕鎭公所，月貼各敎員白米五斗至六斗不等，故師資亦較他處優良·且能安心任事。治安尙稱安謐，事實上並無武裝駐軍維持，其內幕實堪尋味，詳情亦實非會邊一過其地，如記者者所可了解也。</p>
<p>所謂杜米</p>
<p>杜行是南匯縣極西近浦江邊的一個小鎭，記者在茶肆休憇時，遇一老農，相與暢談半年前杜行的米市。其當時熱鬧情况，不滅目前滬市隣近之周家橋與徐家匯。事雖明日黃花，然仍可供一般關心民食者之參考也。</p>
<p>按杜行在南匯，並非產米區，除自身需要外，居民類多爲米阪，供給滬市民食。「杜米要　？」一語，不啻已成浦東人之代名詞，但以其本區產米至微，故全靠松江金山等處運來，然後再販運至滬。旋因上海統制米糧之情勢緊張，故杜行之米販，除大販可花一筆費用，運動通過封鎖綫外，其餘普通米販，則皆冒萬分之危險，挖空心思，設法運滬，除一路之必要開銷外，所獲仍　可觀，但實非易事也。</p>

<h3>東綫蘇軍　發動新攻勢　古本公路一帶激戰中</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍事發言人：目前蘇軍進攻之焦點，爲在波柏與奎斯兩可間，北達古本城（Guben）南抵勞班城，（Lauban）現正在角戰中。蘇軍攻繫勞班城及哥里茲城（Gorlitz）均被繫退，羅司瓦塞（Roitwasser）再由德軍克復。哥尼夫元帥之軍隊已越索勞（Sorau）與哥里茲間之鐵道，廣四五里公里，克洛森與古本城間，蘇軍亦被阻。</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　海通社訊，東綫蘇軍又採取新攻勢，西貝斯基特迤北區戰事稍弛，廿四小時內德軍抗戰頗得手。哥尼夫上將統率之蘇軍，在沃特河套之外拓展攻勢，抵克洛森與勞班綫，蘇將似有於太戰之前，使部隊進逼古本之公路一帶。沿索勞。哥里茲鐵路有激戰，德軍力抗且不時反攻，敵進展殊微，庫斯特林之北，蘇軍祇作局部攻勢。西普魯士境內之蘇軍，續向杜歇爾希斯及格勞頓茲之西北進犯，其目的似爲截斷波默拉尼亞，但迄未突破德軍陣綫。敵方亦知北波默拉尼亞。西普魯士及東普魯士之德軍殊爲强盛，使蘇軍之後方頗感危險，因此不顧損失，調動大軍，希冀掃蕩德軍。蘇軍企圖由薩姆　向康尼斯堡進迫，已被繫退。</p>
<h3>渝將派員參加　舊金山會義　艾登接見顧維鈞</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電　德國社訊，據此問阿夫週報駐英訪員稱：倫敦之世界商務聯合會議即將派遺一委員會，參加將於四月二十五日舉行之舊金山「世界和平會議。」該委員會會員將爲蘇聯，英，法，南美，及渝方之代表。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦消息：英外相艾登昨日接見渝方駐英大使顧維鈞，將反軸心在維爾達會談之結果，正式吿知顧氏。艾登並接前波蘭總理米柯拉席克。前波蘭外長羅默。及法美國國大使等。艾登目前所特別留意者，有兩項問題：其一爲波蘭問題，其二爲法國對於克里米亞會議之反應。據倫敦消息靈通方面稱，艾登或於最近赴巴黎一行。</p>
<p>英報論調</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　德國社訊，德政府發言人宣稱：英國報紙之討論中立原則，乃與未來之舊金山會議有關，自中南美數小國對德宣戰後，三大反軸心國即以爲彼等之突然參戰，無非欲在會議中獲得一席位，而分嘗怀羹而已。英國報紙對此極力反對，力言僅大國可以參與，土耳其或得列席，但西班牙則絕對不得參加。</p>
<h3>法國外長報吿　三頭會議經過</h3>

<p>拒絕會見羅斯福特戈爾說明理由</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據巴黎電：特戈爾昨晚關明拒絕會見羅斯福之理由，要旨如次：駐巴黎美大使曾以羅斯福之指令通吿政府，謂羅斯福不克訪問巴黎，特約定在阿爾及爾會見，然特氏因政務繁忙，不克離開巴黎，他方克里米亞會談之基礎，法國旣未獲參加，自不能明其內容，有失却會談之意義，特戈爾反覆表明希望與羅斯福在巴黎會見。</p>
<p>里斯二十一日中央社電　海通社訊，昨日白宮發表公報稱：特戈爾歷公務未能離法，至阿爾及爾與羅斯福會晤一訊，頗使羅斯福失望。據稱，羅斯福邀請特戈爾之請柬，係於到達阿爾及爾之前六日，由美大命名送達巴黎，羅斯福幷表示深望解決有關美法雙方利益之各項問題。</p>
<p>羅斯福歸國途中在埃及小作勾留</p>

<p>緬甸日軍防空陣堅如鐵壁圖示高射砲隊勇士正以彈丸狀入砲腔</p>
<p>菲島日軍制空部隊充滿鬥志</p>
<h3>緬甸戰局新階端</h3>
<p>敵方對日本的總反攻，業已開始了。試看緬甸方面的聯合國軍隊，也呼應美國軍隊在呂宋島登陸作戰，而以新的劇烈資態出現了。英國的東印度艦隊，連日不斷地向日本駐緬航空部隊，加以猛烈的攻繫。英國艦船雖遭極大損失，但仍然航行於密耶鉢。拉母勒。絜通巴等地之前，而掩護阿恰布方面的英軍登陸。同時由緬印國境中北部長驅直入緬甸的英印軍隊，以及美渝聯軍相互配合，在進行着愈烈的戰爭。</p>
<p>滇越戰區</p>
<p>重慶軍政部垂陳誠，在昆明已經成立了重慶軍總司令部，並且整頓和增强了雲南遠征軍，滇越戰區，安南對面的第四戰區，這全是準備招架日本軍隊的大陸新作戰之進攻。同時這也是證明對日反攻的戰雲，逐漸在中國大陸及東南亞洲日益濃厚。所以現在整個亞洲，不分彼此，業已邁入戰爭的最後階段了。</p>
<p>敵方現在所進行的戰爭，目的在想切斷日本本土與南洋各地間的交通連絡，而使日本得不到軍需原料，窒息日本的搞戰力，同是地在於打通萊多公路及滇緬路，以强化中國大陸上的美渝軍隊，更在於藉英國反攻亞洲東南部，以收牽制日本戰力之效。</p>
<p>將帥不和</p>
<p>具有這種意圖的東南亞洲聯軍副司令官美中國將雷孟德。懷勒，向自己部下約翰·赫特提議英軍在東南亞實行陸海總反攻，但因目前印度形勢惡劣，碍難從命，於是雙方意見對立。但因靜養中的蒙物巴頓的調停結果，英印軍才有今天這樣在阿恰布規模的登陸作戰</p>
<p>然而英國這種消極的企圖，濯不是說，並不因菲列賓戰局的變化，而不改變東南亞登作戰的小規模性，老實說，太平洋戰局如熾烈起來，則東南亞決戰也就立刻動起來。</p>
<p>中緬國境</p>
<p>此外，蔣介石派遺中央嫡系軍五師至中緬國境，雲南遠征軍也遷移至昆明，而日本駐中緬國境綫的部隊，乘虛猛撲畹町西方龍川江河岸的一百十六師主力，大破敵軍於南岸，目前敵軍抱頭鼠，而日軍則正追繫中。</p>
<p>東南亞的陸海戰綫，已如上述，正當愈烈之際，而日軍也將展開大規模的殲敵戰爭。（林譯自一月二十六日每日新聞緬甸通信）</p>
<p>歐洲西線參觀記</p>
<p>山於東綫極端吃緊，歐戰終於進入了最後階段，現在所有的德國人民，無不留心東綫上的任何演變，且在集中全力應付來勢甚兇的蘇聯。德國得以專心對抗蘇軍的攻勢，人民並不驚慌失措者，全靠去年秋天倫台特的反攻，以致西綫成爲金城湯池之固。德國軍事最高當局，爲避免兩面作戰，曾經在西綫展開先法制人的攻勢，這就是準應付蘇聯向例的冬季攻勢。記者（杉相特派員）蒙德國當局的厚意，准許以一星期的時間，參觀西綫倫台特攻勢後的科隆及亞琛等戰區。</p>
<p>當美國軍隊在亞琛及杜倫綫發動猛烈攻勢時，大家都以爲德國的軍事機構，將由此處繫潰。足見當時戰憶的嚴重。於是老幼全都逃走一空，剩下的男人固希有不必說，說是婦女也都荷槍禦敵，或在兵六上服務。壯丁全都組成國民突繫隊，分領子彈，派至前綫作嗶，後來山於倫台特攻勢奏效，亞琛地區又歸安定，目前該地的空氣，又逐漸充滿安居樂業的景象了。一時逃難他鄕的當地居民，也陸續回到自己的家來。</p>
<p>萊茵河畔</p>
<p>然而這一納粹黨大官區中的十八處，以逐鹿中原管區中的六處，全部或局部地仍然操於英美軍把持之下。目前的戰綫，業已迫近當本部所在地的科隆西方三四十里的地方。所以當順風的時候，往往不斷地聽到隆隆砲聲。該處的軍人招待所裏，聽到士兵們倥惚的鞋聲，實令人感到前綫的景象。萊茵河畔的各個都市，素以優美文雅著稱，然而現在却成爲雪堆中的瓦礫廢墟。</p>
<p>化爲慘不忍睹的一片焦土的各個城市，敵機仍然不發畫夜地大加轟炸，空襲警報與解除警報，往往相互交錯。交通綱完全破壞，民心警怕。火車只是乘敵機離去的一剎那進行運輸任務。市內電車及郊外電車，完全停止運行，居民的交通工具，除掉靠軍用脚踏一外，就只好安步當車了。</p>
<p>在各個都市的街頭巷尾上，擁齊的市民在寒氣凜冽中等待着軍用車的開和到，記者也是爲搶車而到處奔跑。</p>
<p>同仇敵愾</p>
<p>山於定期定製，德國西部的交通綱，完全出乎紀者想像之外，而受到極大的破壞。然市在這種惡劣條件下，德國竟能完成西綫攻勢的準備，可見德國組織力的强大。同時在這樣環境　中，當地居民每天還要照常上班工作，由此可以看見德國人民的堅强性。</p>
<p>他們往往費一二小時步行走到工塲。但德國西部的人民，仍未受到飢寒交迫的痛苦。他們的心裏，只是沸騰着仇視英美的敵愾情緒。上至納粹黨的幹部以及將士，下至商店的老板娘，都一提到英美時，總是怒憤塡膺。</p>
<p>有一個非常清郎的天氣，記者正在某處行走，仰視天空，正如蛟龍般在高空中飛走般，拖着長和的黑烟尾巴。市民全部都立在街頭中心仰視着嗖嗖的聲音，正如人民心弦上所發出來的同仇敵愾聲。</p>
<p>民心鎭定</p>
<p>記者在由科隆向何恩去的汽車中，被一位年靑女郞所喊住，勉强擠上車，據說是到兵營，求見未婚夫去的。在車中，這位女郎和兵士們談笑風生。一進保劯的市街，驚心動魄的空襲警報就鳴鳴地響起來，這位年靑女郞反說，敵機決不會光顧此處的，所以最好在此處先吃晚飯。因此就有很多士兵們住在此處先吃晚飯。因此就有很多士兵們住在車上，大家都毫無驚色。</p>
<p>同記者談笑的，全都說德國西部的人雖遭此悲慘情形，但仍未失掉自信，而在頑强抵抗着他們簡直是德國人民抗戰中的民族英雄。</p>
<p>生產救國</p>
<p>保恩這個以大學著名的都市，差不多十空九空，且全部建築物的十分之五六，完全毀於砲火。全市十萬人口中，經當局疏散者不過老幼七千名。市民現在已經談不到起居間，更談不到浴室，大家都蹲居在殘缺不全的破室中。</p>
<p>雖說他們大部份都能在一星期中有六天透空氣，晒晒陽光。但多數地下工塲以及辦公室中作工者，除星期日外簡直不能看見天日，即在星期日這樣所謂休息日，從早晨八點至下午兩三點，還要受國民突繫隊員的軍事訓練，此外則要到市郊去忙於建築防禦設備。</p>
<p>一個突繫隊員曾參加過第一次世界大戰的老兵。他的兩個兒子在意大利東部戰塲上作戰，他不願落後於他的兩個兒子，而在發揮最大的勞動熱忱，爲國家服務。因爲他爲已超過徵兵年齡的六十五歲，所以只好自動參加國民突繫隊。</p>
<p>該地在第一次世界大戰時，曾要求脫離大德意志帝國，而現在却滿映着皚皚白雪。記才眺望着緩緩而流的萊茵河，不禁發生無限感慨，並在心頭上記起希特勒元首新年獻辭上的一句話：「德國人民將從此新生」。（方譯自一月三十日讀賣報知德國通信）</p>
<h3>薩爾布魯根　爭奪戰激烈　北路哥許城發生巷戰</h3>
<p>柏林廿一日中央社電　海通社訊：星期一在繆斯河與萊因河下遊進攻之加拿大軍，仍未能達到其目的，僅侵入哥許城，現正在巷戰中。敵軍仍續調後備軍參加作戰。林尼許附近美軍企圖渡魯爾河未逞，美第九軍砲繫益烈，敵大攻即將開始。美第一軍戰區尙無大戰，昨美第三軍由烏爾河兩側夾繫普魯姆城，巴頓將軍之軍隊僅稍獲進展。南部美軍第七軍攻繫薩爾布魯根，現已發生惡戰，其目的似欲與進攻帕拉丁納南部之美軍取得連絡，並佔領薩爾布魯根城前面大高地。</p>
<h3>法戰時損失　鐵路橋樑幾全毀</h3>
<p>馬德里二十一日中央社電　德國社訊，巴黎「法蘭西報」以「法國解放之代價」爲標題，發表論文一篇，描述反軸心輕率之作戰方法，與無力恢復正常之交通。內稱，在賽恩河羅爾河羅尼河或其他河上，今日幾無任何橋樑，在一九四〇年鐵路橋樑被毀五百五十座，同時在一九四四年前所有之橋二千座之中，已有一千九百座完全被毀，公路橋樑完全破壞或受者，共計三千一百二十五座，除法國南部少數運河外，其他河上之航運，完全陷於停頓狀態，河船一萬三千艘之中，今日可用者僅五千艘，法國之港口設備亦受嚴重損害，非數年內可以重建。</p>

<h3>警察當局决協力　執行新限價　盼各業商人嚴行自肅</h3>
<p>市警察局爲此次經濟核定主要商品新限價，決協力强化執行，昨特發表談話，希望各業商人購買市民嚴行自肅，茲錄談慶如下：</p>
<p>「昨廿一日經濟局發表謂：上海市物價評議委員會此次爲應物價緊急措置條例，對主要商品十六品目中十一品目，決定公定價目，自本月二十日開始實施，其公定價之遵守與否，影響今後之物價對策與民生安定上至深且鉅，過去一般市民雖苦於物價高漲，但反面因對物價之認識不足，常這隨奸商之不法　價　　　　市價格，巧買囤積，唯利是圖，本警察局基於物價緊急措置條例之趣旨，　　財比次發表之公定價格，即對有協定價之商品，均動員經濟警察之總力，在緊邦憲兵隊之協力下，施行强化取締，各商號對主要商品，附以確定標簽，固當嚴守公協定價格，即一般市民，對　食油，　肥皂，　自來火，　蠟燭，　紙類，　棉花，　棉製品，　猪肉，　牛肉，　煤球，　鈣國藥品等之十一品目，亦應熟知其公定價格，以期協力防止商號之不法販賣。（關於外國藥品之公定價，於去歲十一月一日，由新藥會同業公會呈請市經濟局，以原料價格爲基準而計算者，但因種目繁多不便發表，遂以價格表指示各店者。）違反公協定價，不獨其經售商有罪，即購買者亦然，故本警察局根於上記見地，今後對無視公定價格之商者與購買者，斷手施以處分，務望一般市民體解當局意旨，嚴行自肅。」</p>

<h3>出淵部長　談返日觀感　日本人民必勝信念堅定</h3>
<p>盟邦日本上海陸軍報道部部長出淵中佐，於昨（二十一）日下午五時二十分偕同前原中尉，江城囑託等在漢彌登大夏，接見本市中國新聞記者團，即席發表返日觀感，並闡述粵漢線最近戰局。茲分誌於後：</p>
<p>粵漢戰局</p>
<p>粵漢線南段戰局，自日軍將新村贛州南雄三地次第佔領後，敵美作戰基地，已完全毀滅，將無法恢復作戰。渝蔣曾計劃以西南爲根據地，進行反攻，但經日軍將湘桂粵漢兩線切斷，加以佔領後，其企圖完全幻滅。蓋敵美航空基地，在西南東南一帶，有二十餘處之多，因上述兩線之被佔，已不能重施故拔。就日軍在大陸作戰之立塲言，猶如一人作戰，左手執大刀右手舉小刀，在必要時即以大刀劈開。現日軍已完成大刀態勢，隨時可由西南進窺重慶，並截斷美渝之斯蒂威爾公路。敵美曾宣稱在斯蒂威公路上，每天平均有二萬五千噸物資運渝，但該公路因沿途缺乏旅館醫院，修理廠快車等設備，運輸並不便利。此次粵南作戰元成，自如刀在咽喉，隨時可予敵方以致命打繫。敵美運輸指揮官在接見重慶記者席上，亦復宣佈美之二十餘處空軍根據地，爲日軍佔領，並謂粵漢路截斷後，滿粵運輸即可打通，因此美軍今後之大陸登陸作戰，益感困難。美以軍火輸渝，其目的在利用重慶之人力，地勢，不惜中國人民之生命財產，在中國造成慘酷戰塲。最近美復派遺聯絡官到渝，彼等因受美之命令，每濫施職權，致時有衝突發生。</p>
<p>返日觀感</p>
<p>本人自一月下名返日，於本月上旬抵滬，在滬常聞日本國內情開與此次本人所止覩者，略有所異。近來敵美空軍，時向日本本土轟炸，日本民，不但因此毫無動搖，反甚安定，被炸各地，絕無若何驚慌狀態。上月二十七日敵美機九十架，轟炸東京少數地點，因而起火，但市民對之極爲安定，並立爲有組織之滅火工作，最近復有轟炸實際亦無損失。滬地物價高漲，想像中日本物價，必與此間相同，但事實上毫無漲價現象，本人在一星期內，即五元鈔票亦無法用掉，可見物價之一般。同時日本人民之主要食糧，仍極豐富，僅蔬菜等則略有限制。一般想像中亦以爲日本缺乏人力資源，惟在一月二十七日，經空製後，靑年少年，到處充滿，一若上海南京路上之熙撰擁擠。綜合本人此次牛農對泣日觀感，概括言之，即日本人心堅定，對戰爭必勝信念確立不移而深欣慰。</p>

<p>本月三日，市宣傳處舉行之第二次記者列會席上，某報記者爲本市若干私立學校，竟於鷴內設立店肆，公然營業一事，特向敎育當局提出如下一問題：「若干學校竟於校內設立店肆，公然營業，未悉當局如何取締？」同時並檢舉某中學內設立火腿店爲例證，要求敎育當局加以解答；敎育局長戴英夫氏卽謂：「上海私校，尙英美租界時代之遺毒，昔工部局所發給學校之執照，乃爲「營業執照」，其執照與茶館酒家所發者相同，於是產生學校卽學店之意識，此等營業學店之遺毒，本人極感臺感，此誠爲嚴重問題，希望學店舖主，能變更觀念，而從事國家社會基礎的敎育事業」云。據此而論，今日之私立學校中，竟有兼營商業者，已爲不辯之事實，然則，我們站在搶求上海敎育界的日趨腐敗的立塲，對此一問題之深覺「嚴重」，自與敎育當局，抱有同感，此嚴重問題之解決，期諸於「學店舖主」之自動的「變更觀念」，恐有未能，蓋學校內設立店肆，公然營業，卽證明「學店舖主」對躱避「學校商店化」之嫌欵亦已有所不加措意，用是而欲求其變更視學校如學店之觀念，豈非「與虎謀皮」？但此一問題茍不獲其澈底的解決，則其貽害之甚，當不僅墮詩書諷誦之塲爲市儈逐利之所，而其中舞弊糾紛的產生，且將影響及於社會治安以及國家戰時法制之推行。茲試言之：今春以來，各私立學校所徵怍的學費數額，莫不暴增四五借，而對敎保職員工待遇之改善並不加以合理之調整，致使校長與敎職員工間糾紛層起之事實，已頗不乏見，此種現象之存在，自必以學生學業爲犧甡，於是負担鉅額學費而期其子弟能獲得得敎育機會之學生家長，勢必亦被捲進此糾紛漩渦而有責難，然則，社會秩序之紛亂，勢增其緊張之程度。但此種現象之由來，自有其他客觀的環境條件，惟其根本廠結所在，實不外乎「學店舖主」握有利用學費收入用作商店資本以求暴利所致。而「學店舖主」之握有此種特權，則又基於學校商店混而爲一之機會。故換言之：欲消弭此種糾紛，必先根絕「學店舖」得能利用游資以求暴利之機會，是則取締學校內設立商店，勢必須執行，自是無所疑義之事，此其一。</p>
<p>其次，政府實施食糧重點配給，屬於敎育界的敎職員工亦獲得重點配給之後，「學店舖主」即利用其學校與商站混而爲一之機會，將其使用於商店業務上的職員夥友，甚或包車，燒飯娘姨，傭婦，練習生等；盡以敎員，職員，庶務，校工名義，盡列於重點配給申請單內，用以矇蔽政府，騙取額外配給物資；似此行爲，實際上卽利用技巧以破壤國家戰時配給制度，影響所及，卽不限於個人之得失，而竟危及整個國家作戰之措置，然則，爲消弭「學店舖主」利用機會以掩護其犯罪行爲，取締其校內設立商店，是爲最有效力之方法；同時，以維護國家作戰體制，蘄致戰爭勝利之立塲而言，似此行動亟應加以嚴厲制裁，自屬責無旁貨，此又其一。</p>
<p>再次，本市電力一再節約之後，各種營業莫不盡感環境之需要，與當局協力節省電流之使用，以許多「學店舖主」，在此節約電流聲中，利用學校爲「文化機關」之理由，申請特許使用鉅額電力，於公共交通所不可缺之電車尙且時以節電之故而不時停駛之今日，竟有「學店舖主」之「公館」內，裝設三四具電爐以供取煖者有之，於每晚十時後即行停止電流供給之家庭盡以油盞代替電燈以賡其爲生活而不得已之夜間工作之際，「學店舖主」之「公館」內，電埠齊明以資雀戰終宵者有之。此種現狀，卽說明「學之機會，以一人而巧取多人之享受，値茲時局日趨張，國家民族益陷困難之時，國民應如何自肅以爭取勝利，已爲不爭之論，今以自謂負責敎育之「學店舖主」面至此荒淫地步，若不加以制裁，國家民族固無論矣，而社會民生之以其糜費公物之日甚，亦將益陷窘困之地，此不能不加取締學校內設商店兼設「公館」，此又其一。</p>
<p>綜觀上述各點，爲整肅敎育界之風紀，固應取締「學校商店化」，爲維護良善人民應得之配給物資以及應有之公益享受權利，取締「學校商店化」，亦屬應母容議之事。至其取締之法，僅以與論界之言論動之以道德觀念，已屬無效，蓋不少「學店舖主」對於輿論之指摘，視之謂「見怪不怪」，故必由負責治安潰散局，於接此類檢舉之報吿後，即行派員實地調查，一旦獲有證據，即行從嚴懲處，庶幾國家民族生命所寄之敎育事業，得以維持，國家作戰體制得能推行，戰時社會秩序得以安定。</p>
<h3>疏散人口之商榷</h3>
<p>— 仲素</p>
<p>關於疏散人口問題，吾人願就一得之愚，附責末議如次：</p>
<p>一，疏散人口委員會，旣經組織，經費也有着落，目前惟待迅速執行，委員會要儘量避免坐而言，充分發揮起而行的效率，因此：</p>
<p>（甲）委員會應多注意外勤人員，應廣攬平索熟稔沿京滬京忱兩路永陸交通情形，操守謹戰具有肝胆者，分司指導及疏散前後之諸般工作。</p>
<p>（乙）委員會官訊派人員，分赴各縣區與當地有關當局，勘城內及離城十里以之近郊地區民間大族之禮宇及痷觀寺廟，貧兒院，養老所，及其他慈善集團。以供安置疏散市民之用。</p>
<p>（丙）委員會應在各縣區設立臨時辦事處，即着前項人員於疏散民衆抵站埠時，分頭照料，俾免臨時秩序紊亂。</p>
<p>（丁）臨時辦事處，應與各縣區當局就各地之術要，擇壯有力之被疏散游民，於疏散到達後，分執修路，濬河，墾荒諸役，並施以軍事訓練，需正其不良習慣。</p>
<p>二，疏散人口之登記，應分自動與强迫；此事由各區保甲長戶長負責，而輔以各省縣同鄕會職員，前者稔悉區內市民之職業，後者則以桑梓之誼，可以協且解決其疏散到達後之種種困難。除自動登記自願回里者外，凡無正當職業者，疏散時必多方趨避，應由保甲戶長及警察，按區搜索，集中留置，最先遺散；遺散此等游民，旣含有强迫性；宜特別注決於管敎　。俟到達地區後，視其年齡之高下，審其體力能力之强弱，使服各服勞役。</p>
<p>疏散工作，慮其始固不易，善其後尤艱難；羅秘書長談話中所再三致意者在此，下走之數陳淺見者亦在此！</p>

<h3>靜坐之經過</h3>
<p>— 陳本年</p>
<p>余居重慶路一〇三號，與因是靜坐學社相近，三十三年秋加入第六期班，初坐覺萬念業集，心意未寗，且不慣盤膝。師曰久則自慣，毋恐毋餒。至兩月，同坐者數十人，有前坐一人，肩背微有搖動，心異之，乃勤加　習。中秋後三日晨六時，靜坐中忽覺兩腿搖動不已，初意以爲偶然耳，漸至胸腹震動，兩手脫握而出，作環抱勢，旋轉如風，順逆互易，皆三十六轉，頭部則左右前後搖掘亦三十六次。是日亟趨老師處報吿經過，曰此乃初期震動，越日遇課期，因余震動過烈，室中擺設皆爲動搖，於農曆冬至午夜，獨睡於被內，仰臥，並不盤膝，試依法行之，亦能震動，且漸覺尾癌關酸痛，有熱氣直上背部，肩背因之動搖不已，直上至頸骨，由頭頂而至眉目，則兩眼開闔不停，時而圓睜兩目，眼球分左右旋轉，由算分歧而下，算亦扇動，至上下顎，面頰牙槽皆震動，余心鎭靜不亂，當斯時，舌尖本緊抵上顎，內部亦忽自震動，攪盪伸縮不已，由是漸漸平靜。從胸腹復歸於臍下丹握中。此後每坐皆然，乃至社中吿老師，師詫謂除沈吟梅外，未有如此此速效者，汝三關已通，好自爲之。夫靜坐乃却病延年之法，延年須視各人根基，却病則人人可以修得，病夫之國正爲對症良藥，今靜坐社即日招收第七期社員，三月初上課，余因獲此大效，故不敢自秘，將經過情形，吿諸有志者。</p>

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Forces Meet - Enemy in Manila Surrounded - Fierce Fighting Continues on Both Banks of the Pasig River</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Under enemy artillery fire, the Japanese garrison in Manila launched a counterattack on the enemy's flank on the 18th, and joined forces with newly-arrived elite Japanese army units advancing from the northeast, east of Manila. The enemy forces concentrated in the lower eastern part of Manila are now surrounded by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's counteroffensive around Manila is intensifying. The Japanese army and naval forces defending Manila are fighting fiercely for strongholds inside and outside the city, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat, especially around the Central Post Office in the old city and near the University of the Philippines. On the evening of the 18th, they killed or wounded over fifty enemy soldiers near the racecourse. The enemy forces that have infiltrated Manila are either holding onto surviving buildings or constructing earthwork defenses to guard against Japanese attacks. Simultaneously, the elite Japanese units that attacked the enemy's flank from the northeast of Manila stormed into Quezon City Airport northeast of Manila on the night of the 19th, penetrated the enemy's center, and suppressed them. In addition, another unit advancing west towards Meycauayan, 15 kilometers north of Manila, attacked over 250 enemy soldiers carrying five armored vehicles in the Bulacan area northeast of the city on the evening of the 18th, capturing a large amount of supplies and inflicting a crushing defeat on the enemy, achieving a major victory. Another elite regiment advancing from the south ravaged enemy tank groups and artillery positions, dodging enemy air raids and breaking through the enemy's rear lines. By the end of the 18th, they had joined forces with the Japanese naval units in Makati, resulting in a situation where the enemy forces were being encircled from the east and north by Japanese forces advancing from the northwest of Manila.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Fighting continues to be fierce both inside and outside Manila. Japanese forces are tenaciously defending their strongholds, especially in the old city of Intramuros on the south bank of the Pasig River, holding onto the ancient Spanish fortresses, preventing the enemy from approaching. Fierce fighting is continuing. Because many residents who were unable to evacuate remain in the city, the Japanese army is also protecting them during operations. According to a United Press dispatch on the 20th, the enemy commander in charge of attacking Intramuros, Major General Griswold, will launch a scorched-earth attack on the Intramuros area. He reportedly stated that because the U.S. military had lost many soldiers in Manila, he had decided to launch a destructive attack. Intramuros contains Spanish-era Catholic churches, which are used as shelters by residents. The fact that the U.S. military is now launching a destructive attack on it because of excessive troop losses is an inhumane act that is truly infuriating.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle for Corregidor Island - Japanese Forces Sink Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese garrison in Manila, showing no weakness, is still fighting fiercely with the enemy. Other elite units in various parts of Luzon are echoing this effort, fiercely sweeping away the enemy forces. Currently, off Lingayen Gulf, hundreds of enemy ships and many warships are attempting to reinforce ground troops, operating between the shores of Lingayen Gulf and various locations. Active road construction is underway. Since the 15th, Japanese forces in the area have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy north of San Jose. Although the enemy forces on Corregidor Island have suffered significant damage, they continue to send reinforcements. On the 18th, they landed paratroopers, who hid in dense forests and rocky shores, launching attacks from time to time. Although the circumference of the small island in the bay is only five kilometers, the two armies are engaged in a fierce, bloody battle for control of this island. The elite Japanese army and naval forces stationed on the island have repeatedly used accurate fire and unique hand-to-hand combat tactics to kill countless enemy soldiers. One army unit, under the cover of darkness, sank one enemy battleship and one transport ship.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Sinks Enemy Submarine</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in the South Pacific, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese air units discovered an enemy submarine in the southwestern Pacific on the 20th, launched a fierce attack, and sank it.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Foreign news today: Japanese forces in Manila have launched an offensive and made steady progress, having joined forces east of the city, causing the American forces that invaded the city to face enemies on all sides and become encircled. This reporter recently interviewed a military expert, asking about the Japanese strategy on Luzon Island. He replied as follows: Since the enemy forces landed in the Lingayen Gulf area of Luzon, their main focus of attack has been Manila. The Americans believe that Manila is the political center of the Philippines, and capturing Manila has great political significance. In other words, capturing Manila means occupying the entire Philippines. However, from a military perspective, Manila is only one city in the Philippines. The Japanese army only stationed a small force in Manila, resisting the invading American forces in the streets of Manila, while the majority of the army retreated to the northern mountainous areas, luring the enemy deep and launching a flanking attrition strategy, inflicting serious damage on the enemy. After the American forces landed in Lingayen Gulf, they should have launched a frontal attack strategically. However, because the Japanese army held the mountainous areas on the flanks and launched constant attacks, the American forces were constrained and had to rely on the flanks, making it impossible to develop a frontal attack. It was not until today that they were able to invade part of Manila with two divisions. The five divisions of troops near Lingayen Gulf were attacked on the flanks by the Japanese army, putting them in a dilemma. At this time, inflicting a fatal blow is a strategic success for the Japanese army. As a result, the British army re-landed on both sides of the Subic Bay Peninsula in an attempt to recover from their strategic failure. On February 14th, the Japanese garrison on Luzon Island launched a large-scale political attack on the landing American forces. Currently, there are twelve or thirteen divisions of enemy landing forces on Luzon Island, while the Japanese garrison, with the determination to win, is fighting bravely to annihilate the enemy, inflicting damage on the enemy from the flanks.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces on Iwo Jima Fiercely Attack and Destroy 100 Enemy Tanks - Nimitz Acknowledges Increasing Damage</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese garrison forces in the eastern part of Iwo Jima, using the mountainous terrain and fortified positions, fiercely attacked the enemy forces. Around 11 PM on the 20th, they daringly counterattacked the enemy forces at the southern pier and in the southern settlements, inflicting heavy casualties and repelling them. In other areas, the enemy forces approached to within 200 to 300 feet of the main Japanese positions, but suffered heavy losses due to Japanese attacks, and their offensive has stalled, with no active movements.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - By 10 AM on the 20th, the Japanese garrison forces on Iwo Jima had destroyed over 100 of the 300 enemy landing tanks. Over 20 of these were the result of the efforts of a Japanese lieutenant, who dared to engage the enemy with rapid-fire cannons when the enemy began landing in the southern part of the island on the 19th, focusing his fire on the enemy tanks, resulting in the destruction of over 20 of them. After achieving outstanding achievements, the lieutenant bravely died in the first line of defense on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, Nimitz announced on the night of the 20th that the damage to U.S. Navy personnel on Iwo Jima was gradually increasing, stating: "During the landing, the damage to the allied forces was slight, but as the Japanese forces emerged from caves and launched fierce attacks with artillery and mortars, the damage to the allied forces gradually increased." An Associated Press dispatch also stated: "The Japanese artillery fire from hundreds of caves on the slopes near the landing sites is extremely fierce. Although the exact casualties of the American forces are not clear, they are predicted to be considerable."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Washington, 30,000 U.S. naval personnel, transported on 800 ships, landed on Iwo Jima and are attempting to build and expand coastal fortifications. The Japanese forces on the island are bravely resisting, and the intensity of the fighting is far greater than on Tarawa and Peleliu. An Associated Press frontline correspondent reported that U.S. casualties are heavy and that this landing operation is more difficult than past operations, and that the battle will take a long time and involve a lot of losses. Another dispatch stated that the U.S. First Amphibious Group fired 8,000 rockets at the coastline before landing, and the entire island was shrouded in smoke and shrapnel. According to another dispatch, the U.S. military's primary objective seems to be the airbase on Mount Suribachi.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Nanjing - One Shot Down</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Three U.S. Air Force P-51 fighters stationed in Chongqing intruded into the airspace over Nanjing from the west on the morning of the 21st, strafing the Yangtze River area with machine guns before fleeing. However, they were fiercely attacked by ground air defense forces, and one enemy plane was shot down near Jiangxin Island in the capital. In the afternoon, an enemy P-38 plane circled in the airspace before fleeing north after a while. There was no damage on our side.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Connection Between Price Control and Materials Management</h3>
<p>Price controls must be implemented in conjunction with materials management in order to be effective. This is a self-evident principle. If prices are simply controlled without effective methods for managing materials, then the controlled prices are bound to become mere words, and no one will be willing to abide by them. Moreover, unscrupulous officials can use them as a tool for extortion. Even with strict laws and severe punishments rigorously enforced, merchants, who value profit above all else, will certainly find ways to hide materials in anticipation of better prices. Ultimately, there will be no goods for sale in the stores, and consumers will have difficulty making purchases. Therefore, price controls must be accompanied by materials management. This is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>For the sake of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the economic authorities have long established agencies to control prices. However, historically, controlled prices have remained separate from black market prices, with no connection between the two. Controlled prices have even risen in step with black market prices, rendering them meaningless. The authorities have long recognized this, and there have been repeated discussions about the need to manage materials before controlling prices. However, because the authority to manage materials is insufficient and the methods are difficult to make comprehensive, the discussions have been contentious and have not yet been put into practice.</p>
<p>Some argue that the past failure of price controls to take effect was due to a lack of strict enforcement. If strictly enforced, it would certainly be possible to achieve considerable results. However, this argument is not entirely correct. Generally, when a new price control system is implemented, merchants are required to sell the goods displayed in their stores at controlled prices. This is a form of materials management for the goods displayed in the stores, so it is possible to temporarily achieve the effect of controlled prices for the goods displayed in the stores. However, the quantity of these goods is extremely limited, and once the stores run out of goods, the controlled prices will no longer be effective, making it difficult to sustain them.</p>
<p>We believe that materials management must involve managing all or most of the same type of materials stored in the private sector in order to achieve its objectives. Agricultural products are scattered in the vast countryside, making them difficult to manage until they are concentrated. Therefore, the methods for controlling agricultural products must first support the existing institutions for collection and promote centralized distribution, making it easier to manage. However, the current control methods are to destroy existing institutions, block existing distribution channels, and rely solely on control agencies to assign new personnel to monopolize purchases. This is truly useless and harmful, doing twice the work for half the result. As for the production of manufactured goods, it is concentrated in cities, making it easier to manage. The example of past cloth purchases can illustrate this. However, those who were purchased from felt hardship. If there is now an order to register certain materials, merchants will suspect that they are about to be purchased again, and they will inevitably try to escape and take shortcuts, creating more obstacles. If, at the time of registration, it is stated that it is only for management and that there will be no purchases, and that the sale of managed goods will be priced favorably to ensure that those being managed are not harmed and can even obtain profits, then the resistance to management will naturally be reduced, and it can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>When discussing materials management methods, most people focus on hoarding by non-industry people, believing that they should be forced to sell to industry people. However, the current big hoarders have already put up the signs of industry people. Therefore, in addition to cracking down on hoarding by non-industry people, the method of managing materials must also specify the total amount of materials originally owned by wholesalers and purchased from non-industry people, the amount that should be retained each period, the amount to be allocated to retailers, and how to price them; the total amount of materials originally owned by retailers and purchased from wholesalers, the amount that should be retained each period, the amount to be allocated to consumers, and how to price them, one by one in detail. Efforts should also be made to prevent retailers from reducing allocations and diverting goods to the black market. If this can be done, the purpose of materials management will naturally be easily achieved, and price controls will also be effective. This proves the necessity of the connection between managing materials and controlling prices.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Fears Major Japanese Offensive</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from Chongqing, He Yingqin stated at the graduation ceremony of the third class of the Standardization Military Academy in Kunming on the 19th that the Japanese army, in addition to the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, also has a large number of troops stationed in mainland China. These troops are deployed to defend against American landings on the Chinese coast. The establishment of a new General Headquarters in Kunming by the Chongqing army is also to prepare for a major Japanese offensive.</p>
<p>The Trend of Decisive Battles on the Mainland is Increasingly Tight</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Judging from the joint operations of the U.S. Army, the Chongqing Army, and the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the trend of decisive battles on the mainland is becoming increasingly urgent. In particular, the general counter-offensive situation in the southwest by the American ground forces and the 90th Division of the Chongqing Army should be guarded against. Since June of last year, the U.S. Army has gradually moved into the mainland. In late June, it had placed a mechanized detachment of scientific weapons on standby in Chongqing. Subsequently, a full regiment of heavy artillery, mainly consisting of 105mm and 75mm howitzers, a tank regiment, an anti-tank artillery unit, and large numbers of imported parachute troops were successively concentrated near Kunming, with an estimated total strength of over 30,000. The logistics units are deployed on the southwestern front, and some have advanced to Xi'an, reportedly attempting to attack the North China front. Some of the American-equipped Chongqing Army's expeditionary force in Burma and the Chongqing Army in India have been concentrated around Kunming.</p>
<h3>Ishiwata Appointed State Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary - Tsushima Juichi Appointed Minister of Finance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Due to the resignation of Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirose, the Japanese government has decided to make some personnel changes. First, Minister of Finance Ishiwata was appointed State Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary. The subsequent Minister of Finance has been determined to be President Tsushima Juichi. Prime Minister Koiso presented this to the Emperor at 5:30 PM on the 21st, and the imperial appointment ceremony was held in the palace at 7:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Stilwell Road - Weak Transportation Capacity</h3>
<p>Guangdong, 21st (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Chongqing government regards the opening of the Stilwell Road as the lifeline of the war of resistance and has promoted it extensively. After the fall of Shaoguan, the Jian Guo Daily published in Xinyi County in southwestern Guangdong and the Zhongshan Daily both published lengthy articles by a Central News Agency correspondent stationed in Myitkyina, giving a realistic report on the Stilwell Road and listing pessimistic views, which are noteworthy. The main points are as follows: According to their views, even after this road is opened, the Chongqing government will only be able to maintain the war of resistance and will still not be able to carry out a counter-offensive. The reasons are: (1) In the past, the Burma Road was only able to transport 20,000 to 30,000 tons per month. Moreover, this Stilwell Road is 1,800 kilometers long, and its transportation will inevitably be difficult. (2) The number of heavy-duty trucks in India is very small. (3) The opening of the new road is of no benefit to the people, especially since the United States stated before the opening that the China-India highway was only for military use and was not built for the benefit of the Chinese people. This statement has hurt the feelings of the people in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch - Recent Chongqing newspapers have often promoted that the Stilwell Road has been opened, considering this to be the only success of Chongqing in 1944, and calling for American aid to Chongqing to be transported on a regular basis. However, the issue is the transportation capacity of trucks and various facilities on the road. What results will this cause for Chongqing? Let us try to examine it. Since Chongqing began promoting the opening of the Stilwell Road, it has also frequently advertised the establishment of hospitals, etc., to prove the fact that the road has been opened. However, according to Brigadier General Burton, "The transportation on the Ledo Road is limited because it relies on China's own efforts and cannot be fully utilized." This also exposes the function of the Ledo Road.</p>
<p>Reliance on the Enemy America is Clearly a Mistake</p>
<p>The strategic situation established by the Japanese army's current north-south operation on the mainland allows it to launch offensives against Kunming, the terminus of the road, and Guiyang and Xi'an, the gateways to Chongqing, at any time. If necessary, it can immediately cut off its heart and block its supplies. At that time, all that will remain for them is air transport between India and Chengdu, and the narrow passage of the Northwest Highway, which is obstructed by the steep Himalayas, as well as the supply route between Calcutta, India, and Chengdu. However, the above routes are affected by the weather, and due to the attacks of B-29 aircraft, each route has a major supply task. If 100 B-29 aircraft are deployed for attacks all day, they will require 66,000 gallons of fuel, and 300 transport aircraft will be needed to transport the fuel. Even if 20,000 tons are transported each month, it will not be enough. The fuel distribution is 90% to the U.S. military in Chongqing and 10% to the Chongqing army. The dissatisfaction in Chongqing cannot be changed. After the U.S. military arrives on the mainland, the greater the supplies, the more the amount of transportation to Chongqing will be reduced. The Americanization of the Chongqing army also indicates the lack of human resources in the U.S. military in Chongqing. The United States is now relying on its own material strength to fight in the Pacific. However, it is clearly contradictory that they are calling for a counter-offensive against Japan on the mainland, using Chongqing's manpower. In the decisive battle on the mainland, the United States is adopting the vicious method of using its own weapons and the strength of the Chongqing army against the powerful Japan. Chongqing is still yearning for aid, but the result will only be the survival of the fittest.</p>
<h3>German Torpedo Squadron Ambush Enemy Convoy in Arctic Seas - Seven Ships Sunk, Three Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (German News Agency Dispatch) - According to a statement from the German Führer's headquarters: German torpedo squadrons successfully launched a surprise attack on an enemy convoy sailing from Murmansk back to England last Tuesday, sinking one light cruiser, two destroyers, and seven merchant ships, totaling 57,000 tons. Three enemy ships (totaling 19,000 tons) are also feared to have been damaged by the bombing. The German planes made this surprise attack in low cloud cover, but lost only two aircraft.</p>

<h3>An Examination of the Sixth District of Nanhui</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>On the dawn of January 29th, as the east began to take on the shape of a white fish, I rose, braving the cold wind, and boarded a rickshaw that I had booked the day before, embarking once more on my journey. This time, my destination was Zhaolou, under the jurisdiction of Nanhui. As I wanted to visit factories along the way, I took a roundabout route. Apart from the main road, much of the journey was on narrow, winding paths, where pedestrians were scarce, save for the occasional three or five peasant women carrying firewood to the town to seek a good price. Bored on the rickshaw, I chatted with the driver. He claimed to be from Haimen and was originally a farmer. However, due to the excessive taxes and levies in the countryside, farming was no longer profitable. Therefore, he had left his village and fields a year ago to make a living as a rickshaw puller in Pudong. He said that in the best of times (rainy days), he could earn nearly 10,000 yuan a day, averaging around 6,000 yuan a day. But now, due to too many competitors, sometimes he would go two or three days without a customer. After about forty-five minutes, we arrived at Hesha Town.</p>
<p>Visiting Factories</p>
<p>After about forty-five minutes, we arrived at Hesha Town (also known as Xiashen). Asking the locals, I found the location of the well-known Great China Kiln. The kiln was quite large in scale, and the factory site was also very spacious. Although it could not compare with the Longtan Cement Factory, it was still impressive to see such a prominent factory in a small, remote town like Xiashen. According to the owner, Shao Qimin, the factory currently employs about 400 workers, and the tiles and bricks produced are divided into two types: machine-made and traditional. The former had been promoted overseas before the war and was very popular; the latter, in addition to being sold in the county, was also mainly sold in Shanghai. Therefore, the kiln had a branch office on Niuzhuang Road in Shanghai, managing exports and local sales. However, after the outbreak of the war, sales stagnated. To ensure the livelihoods of the workers who had served for many years, they now also manufacture flour to make up for the losses, with somewhat satisfactory results, he claimed.</p>
<p>The reporter left Xiashen and headed to Hangtou Town, which was about three miles away. The town faces the Zhangang River, leading west to the Huangpu River and east to Xinchang. It is the only waterway for transportation in the southern part of Nanhui County. Previously, there were steamers directly to Shanghai, but they have now been discontinued. The port has inter-day passenger transport to Shanghai and Minhang, and behind it is the Zhounan Highway, so transportation is still relatively convenient. The lime kiln is the only one in the Nanhui County area. The kiln has more than thirty workers. Its raw materials are coke and blue stone, which are burned and refined. The lime used for all construction in the county is supplied by this kiln. According to the kiln owner, Zhang Qinbo, the factory's turnover is more than ten million yuan a year, because the current market price of lime has soared to nearly 2,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), which is a world away from the pre-war price of six jiao (a unit of currency) per dan.</p>
<p>An Overview of Zhaolou</p>
<p>From Hangtou, we turned towards Zhaolou, which was quite a distance away. We arrived after noon.</p>
<p>Zhaolou is the leading town in the sixth district of Nanhui County. Commerce is not very prosperous, but there are many gentry families in the area. The district borders Fengxian to the south, the Pujiang River to the west, Zhoupu, a commercial hub of Nanhui, to the north, and Xinchang, the seventh district, to the east. The entire district is divided into twelve townships, with a population of 60,000, and commerce is quite depressed. The only financial institutions in the area are several small pawnshops. Prices are lower than in other districts. Most of the residents are farmers, mostly small farmers, and mostly part-time farmers. There are few self-sufficient farmers, tenant farmers, and very few landlords. The main agricultural products are rice and wheat, followed by coarse grains and vegetables. Farmers near the Mingang River all engage in the sideline of making rush bags, which are of excellent quality and are popular with farmers elsewhere.</p>
<p>Developed Education</p>
<p>Education is quite developed throughout the district. There are five complete primary schools and more than twenty junior primary schools, with 3,000 students. The salaries of the teachers are the highest in Nanhui, as the local township offices provide each teacher with five to six dou (a unit of volume) of white rice per month. Therefore, the teachers are also of better quality than in other places and can devote themselves to their work with peace of mind. Public security is relatively peaceful. In fact, there are no armed forces stationed to maintain order, the inside story of which is worth pondering, and the details are not something that a casual visitor like myself can understand.</p>
<p>The So-Called Du Rice</p>
<p>Duheng is a small town in the far west of Nanhui County, near the Pujiang River. While resting in a teahouse, I met an old farmer and chatted with him about the rice market in Duheng half a year ago. He described the bustling scene at that time, no less than that of Zhoujiaqiao and Xujiahui near Shanghai today. Although it is a thing of the past, it can still serve as a reference for those who care about the people's food.</p>
<p>Duheng is not a rice-producing area in Nanhui. Apart from its own needs, most of the residents are rice merchants, supplying food to Shanghai. The phrase "Du Rice Required?" has become synonymous with the people of Pudong. However, because the area produces very little rice, it relies entirely on transportation from Songjiang, Jinshan, and other places, and then resells it to Shanghai. Because the situation of rice control in Shanghai was tense, the rice merchants in Duheng, except for large merchants who could spend a sum of money to get through the blockade, all risked great danger, racked their brains, and tried to transport rice to Shanghai. After deducting the necessary expenses along the way, the profit was still considerable, but it was by no means an easy task.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Army on the Eastern Front Launches a New Offensive. Fierce Fighting in the Guben Highway Area.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency: A German military spokesman said: Currently, the focus of the Soviet offensive is between Bobr and Kwisa, extending north to the city of Guben and south to the city of Lauban, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. Soviet attacks on the cities of Lauban and Görlitz have been repulsed, and Rotwasser has been recaptured by German forces. Marshal Konev's troops have crossed the railway between Sorau and Görlitz, an area of forty-five kilometers wide. Soviet troops have also been blocked between Krossen and the city of Guben.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency: The Soviet army on the Eastern Front has launched a new offensive. The fighting in the area north of the Western Beskids has eased slightly. The German army has achieved considerable success in resisting over the past 24 hours. The Soviet army, led by General Konev, has expanded its offensive beyond the bend of the Woter River, reaching the line between Krossen and Lauban. The Soviet general seems to be trying to push his troops closer to the Guben Highway area before the main battle. There is fierce fighting along the Sorau-Görlitz railway, with the German army resisting strongly and counterattacking from time to time. The enemy's progress is minimal. North of Küstrin, the Soviet army is only launching localized offensives. The Soviet army in West Prussia continues to advance northwest towards Tuchel and Graudenz, seemingly aiming to cut off Pomerania, but has not yet broken through the German lines. The enemy is also aware that the German forces in North Pomerania, West Prussia, and East Prussia are very strong, which poses a considerable danger to the Soviet rear. Therefore, regardless of losses, they are mobilizing large forces in the hope of wiping out the German forces. The Soviet army's attempt to advance on Königsberg from Samland has been repulsed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Will Send Representatives to the San Francisco Conference. Eden Receives Gu Weijun.</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency: According to the British correspondent of the Stockholm newspaper "Aftonbladet": The World Business Joint Conference in London will send a committee to participate in the San Francisco "World Peace Conference" to be held on April 25. The members of the committee will be representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, South America, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency: London News: British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Gu Weijun, the Chongqing Ambassador to Britain, yesterday and formally informed him of the results of the anti-Axis meeting in Yalta. Eden also met with former Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk, former Polish Foreign Minister Romer, and the French and American ambassadors. Eden is currently paying particular attention to two issues: one is the Polish issue, and the other is France's reaction to the Crimean Conference. According to well-informed sources in London, Eden may travel to Paris in the near future.</p>
<p>British Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency: A German government spokesman declared: The British newspapers' discussion of the principle of neutrality is related to the future San Francisco Conference. Since several small countries in Central and South America declared war on Germany, the three major anti-Axis powers have believed that their sudden entry into the war is only to gain a seat at the conference and share the spoils. The British newspapers strongly oppose this, arguing that only large countries can participate. Turkey may be allowed to attend, but Spain must not participate.</p>
<h3>The French Foreign Minister Reports on the Progress of the Three-Headed Conference.</h3>

<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Paris: Gogol explained last night the reasons for his refusal to meet Roosevelt, the main points of which are as follows: The American ambassador to Paris had notified the government on Roosevelt's instructions that Roosevelt was unable to visit Paris and had arranged to meet in Algiers. However, Mr. Gogol was unable to leave Paris due to busy political affairs. Moreover, France had not participated in the foundation of the Crimean Conference and could not understand its content, which would detract from the significance of the meeting. Gogol repeatedly stated that he hoped to meet with Roosevelt in Paris.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) Hais News Agency: The White House issued a communiqué yesterday stating: Roosevelt was disappointed that Mr. Gogol was unable to leave France due to public affairs to meet with him in Algiers. It is reported that Roosevelt's invitation to Gogol was delivered to Paris by the American ambassador six days before his arrival in Algiers. Roosevelt also expressed his deep hope to resolve various issues related to the interests of both the United States and France.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Made a Brief Stop in Egypt on His Way Home</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) German News Agency: It was announced in Cairo last night that President Roosevelt visited Egypt on his way home after attending the Yalta Conference, and met with Egyptian King Farouk, Abyssinian King Selassie, and Saudi Arabian King Saud on a patrol ship in the Suez Canal area. Before heading back to the United States, Mr. Roosevelt also met with Prime Minister Churchill in Alexandria. American Secretary of State Stettinius also went to that place to report to Mr. Roosevelt on his meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow. American Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant also flew from Britain to Alexandria to meet with Mr. Roosevelt. On his way home, Mr. Roosevelt finally went to Algiers to meet with the American Ambassador to France, Caffery, and the American Ambassador to Italy, Kirk.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt planned to meet with the Turkish side in Egypt after the Crimean Conference, but this was rejected by the Turkish side.</p>

<p>Japanese Army in Burma Has Solid-as-Steel Anti-Aircraft Defenses Shown is a picture of brave warriors of the anti-aircraft artillery troop loading shells into artillery chambers.</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Air Defense Troops in the Philippines are Full of Fighting Spirit</p>
<h3>The New Stage of the Burma Campaign</h3>
<p>The enemy's all-out counteroffensive against Japan has already begun. Observe the Allied forces in Burma, echoing the US Army's landing operations on Luzon Island, now appearing with a new and intense posture. The British East Indies Fleet has been relentlessly attacking Japanese air units stationed in Burma day after day. Although British ships have suffered great losses, they are still sailing towards areas like Myeik, Ramree, and Kyaukpyu, providing cover for the British landing in Arakan. Simultaneously, British-Indian troops advancing directly into Burma from the northern part of the Burma-India border, along with the US-Chinese Allied forces, are engaging in increasingly fierce warfare.</p>
<p>Yunnan-Vietnam War Zone</p>
<p>Chen Cheng, the Minister of the Military Affairs Department of Chongqing, has established the Chongqing General Headquarters in Kunming. He has also reorganized and strengthened the Yunnan Expeditionary Force and the Fourth War Zone facing Annam in the Yunnan-Vietnam theater. All of this is in preparation for countering the Japanese army's new offensive operations on the mainland. At the same time, this also proves that the war clouds of a counteroffensive against Japan are gradually thickening on the Chinese mainland and in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the entire Asia, without distinction, has already entered the final stage of the war.</p>
<p>The enemy's current war aims to sever the transportation and communication between the Japanese mainland and various parts of the South Seas, depriving Japan of military supplies and raw materials, thereby stifling Japan's war effort. It also aims to open up the Ledo Road and the Burma Road to strengthen the US-Chinese Allied forces on the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, it aims to use the British counteroffensive in Southeast Asia to restrain Japanese war power.</p>
<p>Discord Among Generals</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Raymond A. Wheeler, the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, holding this intention, proposed to his subordinate John G. Hefty that the British army should carry out a general land and sea counteroffensive in Southeast Asia. However, due to the adverse situation in India, it was difficult to comply, and thus the two sides had conflicting opinions. However, thanks to the mediation of Lord Mountbatten, who was recuperating, the British-Indian army was able to carry out a landing operation on the scale seen in Arakan today.</p>
<p>However, this passive intention of the British does not mean that the changes in the Philippine campaign will not alter the small-scale nature of the Southeast Asia landing operation. In truth, if the Pacific campaign becomes more intense, the decisive battle in Southeast Asia will immediately commence.</p>
<p>Sino-Burmese Border</p>
<p>In addition, Chiang Kai-shek dispatched the 5th Division, directly under the central government, to the Sino-Burmese border, and the Yunnan Expeditionary Force also moved to Kunming. The Japanese troops stationed on the Sino-Burmese border took advantage of this to launch a fierce attack on the main force of the 116th Division west of Wanting on the Longchuan River, inflicting a major defeat on the enemy on the south bank. Currently, the enemy is fleeing in disarray, while the Japanese army is in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>The land and sea battle lines in Southeast Asia are, as mentioned above, intensifying. At the same time, the Japanese army will launch a large-scale war to annihilate the enemy. (Translated by Lin from the January 26th Mainichi Shimbun's Burma correspondence)</p>
<p>A Visit to the Western Front in Europe</p>
<p>With the Eastern Front extremely strained, the European war has finally entered its final stage. Currently, all the German people are paying close attention to any developments on the Eastern Front and are concentrating all their efforts on dealing with the fierce Soviet offensive. The reason why Germany can concentrate on resisting the Soviet offensive and why the people are not panicking is entirely due to Rundstedt's counteroffensive last fall, which made the Western Front as solid as a fortress. The German military high command, in order to avoid fighting on two fronts, launched a preemptive offensive on the Western Front. This was a winter offensive intended to respond to the Soviet precedent. The reporter (Special Correspondent Shan Yu) was granted permission by the German authorities to visit the Cologne and Aachen war zones after Rundstedt's offensive on the Western Front for a week.</p>
<p>When the American army launched a fierce offensive on the Aachen and Düren lines, everyone thought that the German military organization would collapse from here. This shows how serious the war was at the time. Therefore, the old and young all fled, and the remaining men, needless to say, even the women were armed to defend against the enemy or served in the military. All the able-bodied men formed national assault teams, distributed bullets, and were sent to the front lines as cannon fodder. Later, because Rundstedt's offensive was effective, the Aachen area returned to stability, and the atmosphere there is gradually filled with the scene of people living and working in peace. Residents who had fled to other places one after another returned to their homes.</p>
<p>On the Banks of the Rhine</p>
<p>However, eighteen districts in this large Nazi party area, and six districts in the area of contention, are still entirely or partially held by the British and American armies. The current front line has already approached the area thirty or forty miles west of Cologne, where the main headquarters is located. Therefore, when the wind is favorable, one often constantly hears the rumbling of artillery fire. In the military reception center there, hearing the hurried footsteps of the soldiers makes one truly feel the scene of the front lines. The various cities on the banks of the Rhine, formerly known for their beauty and elegance, are now ruins in the snow-covered rubble.</p>
<p>The various cities, reduced to a scorched earth scene too ghastly to look at, are still heavily bombed by enemy planes day and night. Air raid alarms and all-clear signals often alternate with each other. The transportation network is completely destroyed, and the people are alarmed. Trains only carry out transport tasks during the brief moments when enemy planes have left. City streetcars and suburban trams have completely stopped running, and the residents' means of transportation, apart from relying on military bicycles, are forced to walk.</p>
<p>On the streets and alleys of various cities, crowded citizens wait in the biting cold for the arrival of military vehicles. The reporter also ran around everywhere to grab a vehicle.</p>
<p>Common Hatred for the Enemy</p>
<p>Because of scheduled manufacturing, the transportation network in western Germany has been completely destroyed to an extent far beyond the reporter's imagination. However, that Germany was able to complete preparations for the Western Front offensive under these harsh conditions shows the strength of German organization. At the same time, in such an environment, local residents still go to work as usual every day, from which one can see the strength of the German people.</p>
<p>They often walk one or two hours to get to the factory. But the people of western Germany have not yet suffered the pain of hunger and cold. In their hearts, there is only a boiling hatred for the British and Americans. From the cadres of the Nazi Party and the generals to the shopkeepers, whenever they mention the British and Americans, they are always filled with anger and resentment.</p>
<p>On a very clear day, the reporter was walking somewhere, looking up at the sky, and saw planes flying high in the sky like dragons, dragging long black smoke tails. All the citizens stood in the center of the street looking up at the swishing sound, just like the sound of common hatred for the enemy emanating from the heartstrings of the people.</p>
<p>Calm Hearts</p>
<p>While in a car from Cologne to Heen, the reporter was stopped by a young woman who squeezed into the car, saying that she was going to the barracks to see her fiancé. In the car, the young woman talked and laughed with the soldiers. As soon as they entered the protected city streets, the alarming air raid sirens sounded loudly. The young woman retorted that the enemy planes would definitely not visit this place, so it would be best to have dinner here first. Therefore, many soldiers stayed in the car and had dinner here first. Therefore, many soldiers stayed in the car, and everyone was not alarmed.</p>
<p>Those who spoke with the reporter all said that although the people of western Germany have suffered such a tragic situation, they have not lost their confidence and are stubbornly resisting. They are simply national heroes in the German people's war of resistance.</p>
<p>Saving the Nation Through Production</p>
<p>Bonn, a city famous for its university, is almost nine-tenths empty, and five or six tenths of all buildings have been completely destroyed by artillery fire. Of the city's population of 100,000, the authorities evacuated only 7,000 old and young people. The citizens can no longer talk about living rooms, let alone bathrooms. Everyone squats in incomplete and broken rooms.</p>
<p>Although most of them can breathe fresh air and bask in the sun for six days a week, most of those who work in underground factories and offices simply cannot see the light of day except on Sundays. Even on Sundays, the so-called day of rest, they must undergo military training as members of the national assault team from eight o'clock in the morning to two or three o'clock in the afternoon. In addition, they must go to the suburbs to busy themselves with building defensive facilities.</p>
<p>One member of the assault team is an old soldier who participated in the First World War. His two sons are fighting on the eastern Italian battlefield. He does not want to lag behind his two sons and is exerting the greatest labor enthusiasm to serve the country. Because he is over the conscription age of sixty-five, he can only voluntarily join the national assault team.</p>
<p>The area had demanded to secede from the Greater German Empire during the First World War, but now it is covered in dazzling white snow. Looking at the slowly flowing Rhine River, the reporter could not help but feel infinite emotion and remembered in his heart the words of the Führer Hitler's New Year's message: "The German people will be reborn from this." (Translated by Fang from the January 30th Yomiuri Hochi German correspondence)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Saarbrücken; Street Fighting in Geilenkirchen on the Northern Route</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Reuter reports: The Canadian army, advancing on Monday in the lower reaches of the Meuse and Rhine rivers, has still not achieved its objectives and has only penetrated Geilenkirchen, where street fighting is currently taking place. The enemy continues to call up reserves to participate in the battle. Near Linnich, the American army's attempt to cross the Rur River has failed, and the American Ninth Army's artillery bombardment is intensifying, indicating that a major enemy offensive is about to begin. There has been no major battle in the American First Army's war zone. Yesterday, the American Third Army attacked Prüm from both sides of the Our River. General Patton's troops made only slight progress. In the south, the American Seventh Army is attacking Saarbrücken, and fierce fighting has now broken out. Its objective seems to be to connect with the American army attacking the southern Palatinate and to occupy the high ground in front of Saarbrücken.</p>

<h3>Police Authorities Determined to Cooperate in Enforcing New Price Limits; Hope Merchants in All Industries Will Strictly Exercise Self-Discipline</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has decided to cooperate in strengthening the enforcement of the new price limits for major commodities as determined by economic assessment. It issued a special statement yesterday, hoping that merchants in all industries and citizens will strictly exercise self-discipline in purchasing. The statement is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, the Economic Bureau announced that the Shanghai Municipal Price Assessment Committee has decided on the official prices for 11 items out of 16 major commodities in accordance with the Emergency Measures Ordinance on Prices. The observance of these official prices will have a profound impact on future price control measures and the stability of people's livelihoods. In the past, although the general public suffered from high prices, they often followed the illegal prices of unscrupulous merchants because of insufficient knowledge of prices, cleverly buying and hoarding for profit. Based on the purpose of the Emergency Measures Ordinance on Prices, this Police Bureau will mobilize the total strength of the economic police, with the cooperation of the Gendarmerie, to strengthen enforcement of the official prices announced this time, which are the agreed prices for the commodities. All businesses should strictly adhere to the official agreed prices by attaching clear labels to major commodities. The general public should also be familiar with the official prices of the 11 items, including cooking oil, soap, tap water, candles, paper, cotton, cotton products, pork, beef, coal balls, and calcium drugs, in order to cooperate in preventing merchants from illegal sales. (Regarding the official prices of foreign medicines, the New Drug Association and the trade association jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Economic Bureau on November 1 last year, calculating them based on raw material prices. However, because there are too many items to announce, price lists were used to instruct each store.) Violating the official agreed prices is a crime not only for the distributors but also for the purchasers. Therefore, based on the above views, this Police Bureau will impose penalties on merchants and purchasers who disregard the official prices in the future. We hope that the general public will understand the intentions of the authorities and strictly exercise self-discipline."</p>
<h3>Low-Priced Rice Committee Discusses Rice Distribution Methods</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government organized a temporary Rice Purchasing Committee to handle the purchase of low-priced rice. Currently, the first batch of 30,000 stones of rice has arrived in Shanghai, and the rice payments are being paid one after another. In order to handle the inspection, receipt, and distribution work, a separate Low-Priced Rice Committee has been formed to be specifically responsible for the task. The members of the committee will be representatives from six units: charitable organizations, cultural circles, education circles, industrial circles, business circles, and banking circles. In addition, one person will be appointed by the Municipal Government to participate and serve as the chairman of the committee. The committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Kang Le Hotel to discuss the matter. In addition to the representatives of each unit, Rice Purchasing Committee members Li Sihao and Chen Binhe also attended the meeting. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>(1) The "Measures for Issuing Low-Priced Rice" were determined, consisting of four points:</p>
<p>1. Each of the six units (education circles, industrial circles, business circles, news and cultural circles, banking circles, and public welfare and charitable organizations) should send a representative and the Municipal Government should send a staff member to form the Low-Priced Rice Committee to jointly manage matters related to the receipt and distribution of low-priced rice in the warehouse with the responsible person of the Rice Control Committee.</p>
<p>2. Each unit among the six units should send a list of rice payments to its assigned representative.</p>
<p>3. Each household (industrial and commercial households take each trade association as one household) should obtain a rice voucher from the Fuxing Bank payment receipt or the payment receipt issued by its respective unit.</p>
<p>4. After each household (industrial and commercial households take each trade association as one household) obtains the rice voucher, they should take the voucher to the designated warehouse to receive the rice.</p>
<p>(2) The representatives of each unit were appointed as members of the Low-Priced Rice Committee:</p>
<p>Public Welfare and Charitable Organizations: Ye Zhenquan</p>
<p>Banking Circles: Cao Boquan</p>
<p>Education Circles: Ni Tingchun</p>
<p>News and Cultural Circles: Guan Chunyi</p>
<p>Industrial Circles: Zhang Bofang</p>
<p>Business Circles: Dong Kaizhang</p>
<p>Municipal Government Representative: Shen Zuren (also serving as chairman)</p>
<p>(3) The order of priority for each unit to receive rice is as follows:</p>
<p>First, Public Welfare and Charitable Organizations</p>
<p>Second, News and Cultural Circles</p>
<p>Third, Education Circles</p>
<p>Fourth, Industrial Circles</p>
<p>Fifth, Business Circles</p>
<p>Sixth, Banking Circles</p>
<p>When each household (industrial and commercial households take each trade association as one household) receives rice, it will be managed by the representative of its respective unit, with the cooperation of the representatives of the other units. The date for receiving rice will be determined and announced separately.</p>
<p>(4) After each household receives rice, the sacks used to hold the rice should be sent back to its respective unit within ten days to be collected and sent to the warehouse, and each unit will be jointly responsible.</p>
<p>(5) All expenses for rice extraction, etc., in the warehouse are free of charge. After each household receives the rice, they will be responsible for the transportation expenses themselves.</p>
<p>(6) The Police Bureau is requested to issue an order to the police officers along the way, allowing them to exempt the transport of low-priced rice from inspection.</p>
<p>(7) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce introduced the Cargo Transportation Automobile Industry Association, which can handle transportation matters on behalf of others. The transportation fee is 500 yuan per stone. If each household wishes to entrust the matter, they can contact Director Cui Shifu of the association.</p>
<h3>Part-Time Civil Servants May Not Collect Distribution Items Concurrently</h3>
<p>The Municipal Distribution Office believes that the distribution of goods is one of the wartime control policies, and everyone should understand the difficulties of the times and assist in implementation. It has recently been found that there are many part-time civil servants who are also collecting distribution certificates for goods concurrently. It has been heard that in the future, all key distribution personnel who hold part-time jobs and obtain double distribution of goods should automatically return the certificates to the service organization, which will then send them to the Distribution Office. Otherwise, once the fact is verified, in addition to suspending the distribution of goods to the individual, the service organization should also bear joint responsibility.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao's Key Distributions Must Be Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Distribution Office underwent a thorough reorganization, it has been implementing key food rice distribution since January. The distribution quantities and methods for various agencies and organizations have also been separately drafted and reported to the Municipal Government for record. It has been heard that regarding this type of key distribution, the Municipal Government has issued an order stating that except for those approved on file, they will be issued as usual. In the future, if an agency or organization directly requests the Distribution Office to issue goods, they must first submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval before the goods can be issued.</p>
<h3>Medical Gas Will Be Provided in Moderation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company has recently reduced gas supplies to general users starting this month due to a shortage of electricity and fuel. Therefore, it is notifying users that they must go to re-register. It is understood that a reasonable amount will still be supplied to those who require it for medical practices. Therefore, all practicing doctors in the city who need to use gas for their work can quickly register with the company.</p>
<h3>Improved Treatment for Municipal School Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the Municipal Government has been very concerned about the lives of teachers and staff in municipal schools. It is heard that Mayor Zhou has personally instructed Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau that, starting this semester in February, the treatment of teachers in municipal primary and secondary schools should be handled in accordance with the new treatment measures for civil servants. They will also be provided with three dou of rice per month free of charge to improve their lives. In addition, the method of salary payment based on qualifications established by the Municipal Education Bureau has also been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and will be implemented starting this February. The bureau is currently assigning senior staff members to review each staff member's qualifications and documents day and night in order to determine their grade. The budget for the increased treatment expenses is also being drafted urgently for submission to the Municipal Government, so that it can be issued with the February expenses.</p>
<h3>Small Newspaper Improvement Content - Held a Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department, in order to supervise the content improvement of various small newspapers in the city, held a discussion meeting for responsible persons of small newspapers in its conference room at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 21st). Representatives from the Social Daily, Ji Bao, Opera World, In Shanghai Newspaper, Li Bao, Prosperity Newspaper, Ningbo Public Gazette, Hai Bao, Oriental Daily, Art Sea Daily, and Drama Daily were present. Director Liu, along with Secretary Yuan, Acting Section Chief Zhang, and Specialist Gu, presided over the meeting. They thoroughly explained the improvement issues of various small newspapers in the city. The key points for improvement included: (1) Increasing the amount of current affairs news; (2) Supporting government policies; (3) Not publishing or making arbitrary comments on unresolved civil and criminal cases in advance; (4) Writing social news interviews with a serious tone; (5) Not publishing attacks on individuals' private affairs; (6) Eliminating lewd and decadent erotic content; (7) Eliminating records of mysterious, bizarre, and absurd stories about gods; (8) Avoiding publishing text promoting improper businesses and gambling-related entertainment; (9) Not leaving blank spaces for censored parts; and (10) Cautiously publishing information on black market prices and industrial and commercial news.

The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Minister Izubuchi Discusses Impressions of Returning to Japan - The Japanese People's Belief in Victory is Firm</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, Minister of the Army Press Department of the Allied Japanese Army in Shanghai, along with Lieutenant Maehara, Trustee Ejo, and others, met with the Chinese press corps of this city at the Hamilton House at 5:20 PM yesterday (the 21st). He gave a speech on his impressions of returning to Japan and explained the recent battle situation on the Yuehan Railway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yuehan Battle Situation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army successively occupied Xincun, Ganzhou, and Nanxiong on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, the enemy's US-made operational bases have been completely destroyed and will not be able to resume operations. Yu Jiang had planned to use the southwest as a base for counterattacks, but their attempt was completely shattered after the Japanese army cut off and occupied the Xiang-Gui and Yuehan lines. The enemy's US air bases in the southwest and southeast were numerous, more than twenty, but because the above two lines were occupied, they could not repeat their old tricks. From the standpoint of the Japanese army's operations on the mainland, it is like one person fighting, holding a large knife in the left hand and a small knife in the right hand, and using the large knife to split open when necessary. Now the Japanese army has completed the posture with the large knife, and can at any time advance into Chongqing from the southwest and cut off the Stilwell Road between the US and Yu. The enemy US had claimed that an average of 25,000 tons of supplies were transported to Yu every day on the Stilwell Road, but the transportation on this road was inconvenient because of the lack of hotels, hospitals, repair shops, express trains, and other facilities along the way. The completion of this operation in southern Guangdong is like a knife at the throat, and the enemy can be dealt a fatal blow at any time. The US transportation commander also announced at a meeting with Chongqing reporters that more than 20 US air bases had been occupied by the Japanese army, and that after the Yuehan Road was cut off, the transportation between Manzhou and Guangdong would be opened up. Therefore, the US military's future landing operations on the mainland will be more difficult. The US is using military supplies to transport to Yu, with the purpose of using the manpower and terrain of Chongqing, regardless of the lives and property of the Chinese people, creating a tragic battlefield in China. Recently, the US has sent liaison officers to Yu again, and because they are under US orders, they often abuse their powers, resulting in conflicts from time to time.</p>
<p>Impressions of Returning to Japan</p>
<p>I returned to Japan at the end of January and arrived in Shanghai in early this month. What I often heard in Shanghai about the situation in Japan was slightly different from what I saw with my own eyes this time. Recently, the enemy's US Air Force has been bombing the Japanese mainland from time to time. The Japanese people not only have not been shaken by this, but are very stable. There is absolutely no panic in the bombed areas. On the 27th of last month, 90 enemy US planes bombed a few locations in Tokyo, causing fires, but the citizens were extremely calm about it and immediately organized fire-fighting efforts. There has been no actual loss from the recent bombings. Commodity prices are soaring in Shanghai, and I imagined that commodity prices in Japan must be the same as here, but in fact, there is no price increase. I could not even spend a five-yuan bill within a week, which shows the general level of prices. At the same time, the main food of the Japanese people is still very abundant, only vegetables, etc. are slightly limited. It is also generally imagined that Japan lacks human resources, but on January 27, after the air raid, young men and boys were everywhere, as crowded and bustling as on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. To summarize my impressions of Japan this time, in general, I am very pleased that the Japanese people's hearts are firm and their belief in the victory of the war is unwavering.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Revamps Personnel - Adjusts Choices for Section Chiefs and Others</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is thoroughly adjusting personnel in order to revamp police administration.

<h3>Industry Association Leaders Urge Compliance with Price Limits - Shops Exceeding Price Limits Will Be Punished Equally</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau has resolved to suppress the rising prices of major commodities. This time, under orders, it has taken emergency measures to manage prices, strengthened the organizational structure of the Municipal Price Review Committee, and approved new price limits for sixteen major commodities. (The coal blocks, rice, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and flour series of products are already under household distribution and do not need to be evaluated). The announcement was made yesterday and has been implemented, and the general public of this city is celebrating. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to people in the economic sector. According to them, the new price limits approved by the economic authorities are still appropriate. This is because the bureau based the city price list of February 5th reported by various industries, and the newly hired specialized committee studied the cost of goods and provided legitimate profits to calculate and determine the market price that should be sold. After review by the Review Committee and approval by the Committee meeting, it can take care of the costs and profits of the business, and the public can buy goods with a certain standard, so that they will not be deceived by high prices. This kind of careful determination of price limits should be desired by both buyers and sellers. However, because the industrial and commercial elements in Shanghai are complex, it is inevitable that there will be secret high-price sales or hoarding and refusal to sell in the future. It is hoped that the relevant economic departments will fully cooperate and thoroughly investigate with an impartial attitude, and severely punish businesses that violate laws and sell goods at prices exceeding the limits, in order to achieve significant results.</p>
<p>(Another message) In order to strictly enforce the new price limits, the Municipal Economic Bureau specially convened a temporary meeting of the trade associations of major commodities at its office at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 21st), and ordered the chairmen of each association to urge their members to strictly comply with the new price limits for business operations. If any businesses are found to be selling goods at prices exceeding the limits, in addition to being sent to the executing authorities for punishment, the chairmen and directors of the affiliated associations will also be punished equally.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Prepares for Meningitis Prevention</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been gradually warming, and meningitis is very easy to occur. It is heard that the local health authorities in this city are actively preparing for preventive injections to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<h3>Pharmacist Association Relocates Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Pharmacist Association has relocated to 431 Fuzhou Road, telephone number 97147, because its original office was insufficient for office work. The association recently received pharmacist certificates and approved lists issued by the health authorities. Those who have applied to the health department for issuance or renewal of pharmacist certificates can go in person during office hours to inquire.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Sixth Charity Football Match: Overseas Chinese United Wins Against China United; China United Suffers a Narrow 1-0 Defeat</h3>
<p>In the sixth charity football match, China United faced Overseas Chinese United. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the two teams clashed at the Racecourse Stadium. The players of China United lacked stamina and suffered a defeat at the hands of Overseas Chinese United, with a final score of 1-0. The first half ended without any goals. The performance of both teams was somewhat lackluster, lacking brilliance. Except for Huang Shijie's tenacious efforts and Li Tiansheng's stability, the other players of China United were mediocre, and the team lacked cohesion, resembling a pile of loose sand. Overseas Chinese United controlled the game from beginning to end. Tai'er Baoka displayed exceptional skills, and Otonilo received high praise. After Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government performed the opening kickoff ceremony, the two teams began to compete. Baojie of Overseas Chinese United made two probes into the opposing territory, but both were unsuccessful. China United, having been dormant for a while, moved into action, and Song Lingsheng obtained the ball and rushed forward, but was ultimately blocked by Ao Zhaonilo. Five minutes later, Overseas Chinese United attacked, and Bama searched near the goal, but was saved by Huang Shijie. The first half ended without any goals. In the second half, China United launched a strong counterattack, but their shots lacked power. Overseas Chinese United's momentum increased significantly. Baojie overcame obstacles, and Yu Lihua and Li Ning showed numerous vulnerabilities. Bao Fei kicked the ball, which entered the goal from under Li Tiansheng's feet, and China United lost a goal. After the goal, Overseas Chinese United dominated the game. Vera launched an offensive from the border, passing to Yatuomali, but Li Tiansheng cleared the ball with one kick. Overseas Chinese United became even more rampant. The players of Overseas Chinese United were seen running amok in China United's territory, but fortunately, there were no further losses. With only five minutes left in the game, China United's luck improved. Gao Baozheng and Sun Jinshun launched a dual attack. Sun made a fierce shot from twenty yards, but Tai'er Baoka made a desperate save, turning the danger into safety. Shortly after, time ran out, and Overseas Chinese United won a narrow victory.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese United: Tai'er Baoka, Luo Xulai, Xiladi, Bolini, Otonilo, Xueweitai, Taikeini, Yatuomali, Bama, Baojie, Vera.</p>
<p>China United: Huang Shijie, Li Ning, Li Tiansheng, Yu Lihua, Tan Fuzhen, Meng Yiliang, Liu Zuru, Sun Jinshun, Song Lingsheng, Gao Baozheng, Yu Liming.</p>

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Establishing Shops within Schools</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizeng</p>
<p>At the second press conference held by the Municipal Propaganda Department on the 3rd of this month, a reporter from a certain newspaper raised the following question to the education authorities regarding the fact that some private schools in this city are openly operating shops within the school grounds: "Some schools are actually setting up shops and conducting business within the school premises. We wonder how the authorities intend to prohibit this." At the same time, he cited the example of a ham shop being set up in a certain middle school and requested an answer from the education authorities. Director Dai Yingfu of the Education Bureau replied, "Private schools in Shanghai still suffer from the remnants of the era of the British and American concessions. In the past, the licenses issued to schools by the Municipal Council were 'business licenses,' the same as those issued to teahouses and restaurants, which led to the idea that schools are also businesses. I feel extremely indignant about these remnants of commercialized schools. This is indeed a serious problem. I hope that the owners of these school shops can change their attitudes and engage in the fundamental educational undertakings of the country and society." Based on this, the fact that some private schools today are also engaged in business is an undeniable fact. Therefore, standing on the position of rescuing the increasingly corrupt Shanghai education sector, we feel the "seriousness" of this problem as deeply as the education authorities do. Entrusting the solution of this serious problem to the "owners of commercialized schools" to automatically "change their attitudes" may not be possible. The establishment of shops within schools and the open operation of business proves that the "owners of commercialized schools" have already disregarded the suspicion of "school commercialization." How can we expect them to change their attitude of viewing schools as businesses? Isn't that like "seeking skin from a tiger"? If this problem is not thoroughly resolved, the harm it causes will not only turn places of poetry and recitation into places of profit-seeking, but also the resulting fraud and disputes will affect social security and the implementation of the country's wartime legal system. Let us elaborate: Since the spring of this year, the amount of tuition fees charged by various private schools has increased dramatically by four or five times, while the improvement of the treatment of teaching and administrative staff has not been reasonably adjusted, resulting in frequent disputes between principals and teachers. The existence of this phenomenon will inevitably sacrifice the students' studies. Therefore, parents who bear huge tuition fees and expect their children to receive a good education will inevitably be drawn into this vortex of disputes and have grievances. The disorder of social order will inevitably increase the degree of tension. However, the origin of this phenomenon has other objective environmental conditions. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that "owners of commercialized schools" have the power to use tuition income as shop capital to seek exorbitant profits. The "owners of commercialized schools" possess this privilege because of the opportunity to mix schools and shops into one. Therefore, in other words, to eliminate this kind of dispute, we must first eradicate the opportunity for "owners of commercialized schools" to use idle funds to seek exorbitant profits. Therefore, it is undoubtedly necessary to prohibit the establishment of shops within schools. This is one point.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the government implemented the key allocation of food, and teachers and staff in the education sector also received key allocations, "owners of commercialized schools" used the opportunity of mixing their schools with commercial entities to list their staff and partners involved in shop business, or even hired drivers, cooks, maids, apprentices, etc., as teachers, staff, general affairs personnel, and school workers on key allocation application forms in order to deceive the government and fraudulently obtain extra allocated supplies. Such behavior actually uses skills to undermine the country's wartime allocation system. The impact is not limited to personal gains and losses, but even endangers the entire country's combat measures. Therefore, in order to eliminate the opportunity for "owners of commercialized schools" to cover up their criminal behavior, prohibiting the establishment of shops within schools is the most effective method. At the same time, from the standpoint of maintaining the national wartime system and achieving victory in the war, such actions should be severely punished. This is another point.</p>
<p>Thirdly, after the city's electricity has been repeatedly conserved, all kinds of businesses are feeling the need of the environment and cooperating with the authorities to save electricity. However, many "owners of commercialized schools," in this voice of saving electricity, used the reason that schools are "cultural institutions" to apply for special permission to use huge amounts of electricity. Even in the case of trams, which are indispensable for public transportation, they are sometimes stopped from running due to power saving. However, there are "owners of commercialized schools" who have installed three or four electric stoves in their "official residences" for heating purposes. At the time when families, who have their electricity supply cut off after 10 o'clock every night, use oil lamps instead of electric lights to continue their night work out of necessity for life, there are "owners of commercialized schools" who have their "official residences" brightly lit with electric lights for playing mahjong all night long. This kind of situation illustrates the opportunity for schools to become business opportunities, using the benefits of a few people to take the enjoyment of many people. At a time when the situation is becoming increasingly tense and the country and nation are falling into increasing difficulties, how the people should restrain themselves to strive for victory has become an indisputable argument. Now, if the "owners of commercialized schools," who claim to be responsible for education, have reached this state of absurdity, if they are not punished, the country and nation are no longer mentioned, and the social life of the people will also fall into a more difficult situation due to the increasing waste of public property. This cannot but prohibit the establishment of shops and "official residences" within schools. This is another point.</p>
<p>In summary of the above points, in order to rectify the discipline of the education sector, it is necessary to prohibit "school commercialization." In order to protect the allocated supplies and the public welfare enjoyment rights that the good people should be entitled to, prohibiting "school commercialization" is also a matter that should not be debated. As for the method of prohibition, it is ineffective to simply move them with moral concepts through the speech of the press. Many "owners of commercialized schools" regard the criticism of public opinion as "seeing the strange as not strange." Therefore, the security authorities must, after receiving reports of this kind of investigation, immediately send personnel to conduct on-site investigations. Once evidence is obtained, they should be severely punished so that the education undertaking on which the life of the country and nation depends can be maintained, the national combat system can be promoted, and the wartime social order can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Evacuating the Population</h3>
<p>— Zhong Su</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of evacuating the population, we would like to offer our humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Population Evacuation Committee has already been organized, and funding has been secured. The only thing left to do is to implement it quickly. The committee should avoid simply talking and fully demonstrate the efficiency of taking action. Therefore:</p>
<p>(A) The committee should pay more attention to field personnel, widely recruit people who are familiar with the land transportation situation along the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Shenyang routes, and who are honest, cautious, and courageous, to be responsible for guiding and coordinating the various tasks before and after the evacuation.</p>
<p>(B) The committee should send personnel to various counties and districts to work with the local authorities to survey the halls and houses of large families, monasteries and temples, orphanages, nursing homes, and other charitable groups in the city and the suburbs within ten miles of the city to accommodate the evacuated citizens.</p>
<p>(C) The committee should establish temporary offices in various counties and districts, and have the aforementioned personnel take care of the evacuated people upon their arrival at the stations and ports to avoid temporary chaos.</p>
<p>(D) The temporary offices should work with the authorities in various counties and districts to select strong and capable evacuated vagrants in each locality and assign them to tasks such as road repair, river dredging, and land reclamation, and provide them with military training to correct their bad habits.</p>
<p>2.  The registration of the evacuated population should be divided into voluntary and compulsory. This should be the responsibility of the district heads, baojia heads, and household heads, and assisted by the staff of the provincial and county associations. The former are familiar with the occupations of the citizens in the district, while the latter can cooperate and solve the various difficulties after their evacuation, based on their shared hometown ties. In addition to those who voluntarily register to return to their hometowns, those who have no legitimate occupation will try their best to avoid evacuation. The baojia heads, household heads, and police should search the districts, gather them together, and evacuate them first. The evacuation of these vagrants is compulsory and should be particularly focused on management and education. After arriving in the area, they should be assigned to various labor tasks based on their age, physical strength, and ability.</p>
<p>The evacuation work is difficult at the beginning, and it is even more difficult to do it well afterwards. This is what Secretary-General Luo repeatedly emphasized in his speech, and this is also why I have presented these humble views!</p>

<h3>Establishment of Buddhist Congee Kitchen and Literary and Art Assistance Society for Moral Education Translation</h3>
<p>The entire board of directors of the Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen, in view of the fact that most cultural undertakings have been suspended and literati are facing hardship, has specially established a Literary and Art Assistance Society for Moral Education Translation to collect manuscripts related to moral education and provide remuneration. The collection of manuscripts will begin on February 25th. The origins and regulations of the association are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A time of turmoil is truly the misfortune of literati. Even the poet-saint Du Fu could not avoid his son starving to death. Since the incident, the literary life has been on the verge of extinction, and scholars have no way to make a living, sighing in despair, which is very pitiful! We believe that culture is the lifeblood of the nation, and the literati of an era are the maintainers of the culture of an era. People with status and wealth in society should hold this concern in their hearts and establish various translation undertakings so that those who make a living by writing can barely survive the difficulties, which is also the way to continue the cultural life of an era. The colleagues of this factory, in view of the urgency of this undertaking, have specially allocated 300 dan of flour from the grain reserves to establish the Literary and Art Assistance Society for Moral Education Translation, and will first translate moral education books as an example. We hope that all people with enthusiasm and necessity in various fields will continue to establish other translation and assistance societies, or subsidize the expansion of this association, to achieve the purpose of universally saving all the ladies in Shanghai, helping the poor scholars and rescuing the civilization, which is a double benefit and creates boundless blessings. The regulations are now set as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscripts received should focus on works related to moral education, such as self-cultivation, governing the world, protecting life, and promoting education.</p>
<p>(2) The writing style should be simple and lively vernacular (such as the illustrated stories of Li Zhipin in the Luohancai magazine and Li Yuanjin's Mingdeng for Dealing with the World).</p>
<p>(3) Remuneration: Grade A is 3 jin of flour per 1,000 characters, Grade B is 2 jin of flour per 1,000 characters. After submitting the manuscript, take the voucher to the liaison office on the eighth day to collect the flour.</p>
<p>(4) Literati who have previously engaged in translation and writing work can submit their unpublished works and the topics they intend to translate and write for solicitation, and the translation can be agreed upon if they are suitable.</p>
<p>(5) Scholars with specialized knowledge in academics can write at will, but the content should be beneficial to the world and people's hearts, or texts that are useful for medicine, agriculture, industry, etc.</p>
<p>(6) For lengthy manuscripts, a small portion can be submitted for review. If the review is successful, advance royalties can be paid.</p>
<p>(7) Liaison office: Upstairs of Sanle Agricultural Products Company, No. 685 Nanjing Road, Shanghai. Time: Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen Entire Board of Directors respectfully.</p>
<h3>Diamond Rings and Gold Watches Donated for Charity Sale</h3>
<p>(1) This office received a letter from Mr. Ren yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, a new year begins and all things are renewed. At the beginning of the year, the poor are threatened by life, displaced, and crying from hunger and cold. How urgent is the need for relief! This official is heartbroken and deeply worried. Since I can still afford to be warm and full, I am sending to your office one 3-point, one 5-point, and one 18K gold watch for auction at the marked price of 300,000 yuan, all of which will be donated to your office's six relief projects. Mencius said: 'Yu thought of the world as if the weak were drowning, and he himself was drowning. Ji thought of the world as if the hungry were starving, and he himself was starving.' I hope that the great philanthropists in the country will contribute money and effort, and let the righteous deeds succeed, which will not only be a deep blessing for me, but also a blessing for society."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Xu Jufang wrote in a letter, "Your office is carrying out various charitable undertakings, which benefit the poor and are worthy of admiration. However, my financial resources are meager and there is no way to respond, which I always feel uneasy about. I am now offering a US-made "SAVAFAL" rubber mat for the bathtub. When laid in the bathtub, it can prevent slipping. I am willing to part with it for a charity sale with a minimum bid of 70,000 yuan, half of which is intended to be donated to student aid and half to be used for orphaned children's subsidies. I hope that you will advocate and lead, so that the great philanthropists in the country will come out to help, so that the effect of relief can be enhanced. I look forward to it!"</p>
<h3>Longevity for the People</h3>
<p>Madame Zhou, the respected mother of the Zhu Shaoji and Zhu Jingshan brothers of the Zhongxing Thermos Factory, reached the age of seventy. Relatives and friends all wanted to offer a toast to congratulate her. However, Madame Zhou knew that times were difficult and the people were suffering to the extreme, so she resolutely cut back on the expenses of feasts and wine, firmly declined the gifts from relatives and friends, and increased the amount to 200,000 yuan to help ten charitable organizations. Madame Zhou did not want to burden her relatives and friends for her own sake, but insisted on doing it herself. This is truly the heart of a kind and compassionate person, and it is appropriate for her to enjoy longevity and a long life. The names of the groups that received donations are listed below: Factory United Hospital, China Child Welfare Association, Fuyou Orphanage, Leprosy Relief Association, Xinwenbao Student Loan, Pushan Villa, China Education Relief Association, Xinpuyu Hall, Vagrant Labor Camp, and this office's Poverty Relief and Abandoned Rights, each with 20,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Year's Group Gathering and Donation of Gift Money to Charity</h3>
<p>Respectfully, in order to promote frugality and help the poor, we initiated a New Year's group gathering last year, and the gift money collected, after deducting the tea expenses, was all donated to charitable organizations. This year, we followed the example and held it at the Jinmen Hotel on the second day of the Lunar New Year. A total of 89 people participated, and the gift money collected, after deducting expenses for refreshments and printing costs, etc., still had a surplus of 111,120 yuan in national currency. We have already donated 11,120 yuan for student aid, and the remaining 100,000 yuan will be donated to the Nursing Home and the Child Welfare Association, 30,000 yuan each, and 10,000 yuan each to your office's Small Loan Fund, Medical Assistance Fund, Elementary School Medical Assistance Fund, and Maternity Assistance Fund, to create blessings for all friends in the new year. Handled by Jiang Yuping, Du Hannan, Ji Ruitang, Li Shouchang, Xu Linsen, Sun Kejian, Ning Shaoquan, and Xiong Juju, together respectfully.</p>

<h3>The Experience of Meditation</h3>
<p>— Chen Bennian</p>
<p>I live at 103 Chongqing Road, near the Yinshi Meditation Society. In the autumn of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1944], I joined the sixth class. At first, when I meditated, I felt that all kinds of thoughts were gathering, and my mind was not at peace. Moreover, I was not used to sitting cross-legged. The teacher said that I would get used to it over time, and that I should not be afraid or discouraged. After two months, there were dozens of people meditating together. One person in front was shaking his shoulders and back slightly. I found it strange, so I practiced diligently. On the third day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, at 6:00 AM, while meditating, I suddenly felt my legs shaking uncontrollably. At first, I thought it was accidental. Gradually, the shaking reached my chest and abdomen, and my hands came out of their grip and made a hugging gesture, rotating like the wind, alternately clockwise and counterclockwise, thirty-six turns each. My head shook left and right, forward and backward, also thirty-six times. That day, I rushed to the teacher's place to report the experience. He said that this was the initial vibration. The next day, when I met the class, because my vibration was too strong, the furnishings in the room were all shaken. At midnight on the winter solstice of the lunar calendar, I slept alone in the quilt, lying on my back, not sitting cross-legged, and tried to do it according to the method, and I could also vibrate, and gradually felt pain in the tailbone, with hot air rising straight up to my back, and my shoulders and back shook incessantly because of it, straight up to the neck bone, from the top of my head to my eyebrows, then my eyes opened and closed non-stop, sometimes staring wide open, my eyeballs rotating left and right, splitting from the nasal root and down, and my nostrils also flapped, and the upper and lower jaws, cheeks, and alveolar bones all vibrated. My heart was calm and not disturbed. At that time, the tip of my tongue was tightly against the upper palate, and the inside also suddenly vibrated, stirring and stretching incessantly, and from this it gradually calmed down, returning from the chest and abdomen to the navel dantian. This happened every time I meditated after that. I reported to the teacher in the society, and he was surprised and said that other than Shen Yinmei, no one had achieved such a rapid effect. He said that my three passes had been opened, and that I should take good care of myself. Meditation is a method of preventing disease and prolonging life. Prolonging life depends on each person's foundation, but preventing disease can be achieved by everyone. The country of the sick is really the right medicine for the disease. The Meditation Society is now recruiting members for the seventh class, which will start in early March. Because I have gained such great benefits, I dare not keep it a secret, and I will tell those who are interested about my experience.</p>
