<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕中央代表舉行長春接收典禮，蘇方亦派代表參加。此爲中國政府自東北淪陷以來自蘇軍手中恢復舊日河山之第一事。長春連日大雪，已成銀色世界，居民紛懸中。蘇兩國國旗，表示慶祝，情况至爲熱烈。經濟委員會主委張嘉璈抵此後，連日與蘇方當局及有關方面取得接觸，長春鐵路近日客輸頗忙，空運置布亦已就緒，當地人民成盼大軍早臨，俾目今混亂狀態可早結束。</p>

<h3>國大代表發表　對時局意見　認目前國是之解決途徑在還軍於國與還政於民</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕國民大會代表，於民族復興節發表對時局共同意見，略謂：吾人認爲，當前國是之解決途徑，不外兩點，即還取於國與還政於民，軍隊爲捍衛國家，保護人民之工具，任何黨派不得據爲私有，必須還之國家，其理甚明，無庸贅述。政權爲全國民命所寄託，自應結束訓政，還之於民。今日國民政府行使政權，在理論上係根據國父孫中山先生之遺敎，而在法律上係依據二十年公布之「中華民國訓政時期的法」，前者規定由訓政以達憲政，爲我革命建國之最高原則，後者乃國民會議所賦與還政於民，應以依法召集之國民大會爲唯一之對象，而由國民大會正式組織民選政府，以行使治權。若此而外，國民政府實無任何私相授受之權力，蔣主席於本年三月一日憲政實施協進會上，曾鄭重宣示：「吾人祗能還政於全國民衆代表的國民大會，不能還政於各黨各派的黨派會議或其聯合政府」，言簡意深，實爲確切不移之眞理。</p>
<p>目前行將舉行之政治協商會議，在法律上本無根據，不過爲解決黨派糾紛之一種商談，使各黨派對國是之意見趨於一致，然國家大計，非依照法律規定之眞正民意機關無權議決。本屆國民大會代表，乃依法由人民選樂所產生，旣非各黨派所能愛憎，亦非政治協商會議所得變更，倘對此基本之大經大法信念不堅，樂措不定，則政府蘄求和平統一之苦心，無由達到，更予野心者以可乘之機，得寸進尺，必無止境。</p>
<p>本屆國民大會，爲我國賞施憲政之始基，而尅期召集，實爲解決國是之坦途，民主政制，法治爲先，任何黨派倘不堅守此現代國家憲政之常軌，一切咸以黨派利益置於人民利益之上，而不惜毀法亂紀，動搖國本，則禍亂相尋，不僅影響國際地位，抑且威脅世界和平。</p>
<h3>平津敵偽物資　儘量配售民衆</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津廿四日電〕處理平津敵偽物資，原則已確定，凡屬民生必需品，儘量配售民衆，平抑物價，得款用以充實地方建設，平行營已派參議董紹良來津，組織處理敵偽物資委會津分會，主持其事。</p>
<h3>我首批藥材　已運抵新加坡</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡廿四日電〕我國藥材業由英船自香港運輸抵此。總量五千噸，此次運到者，乃首批藥品。此批貨物明顯說明中國商業界把握機會之能力。此間常局曾供卸運之特殊便利。據稱：其他貨物將源源運到新加坡，以困難重重，今年耶誕無燈光無肉，亦無啤酒下飲。此間大部份街道多燃煤氣燈。唯以煤氣工人罷工，故乃黑暗無燈。屠塲工人罷工後，又無肉可食，釀酒廠工人亦罷工，故亦無啤酒可飲矣。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁將軍今日在京與何總司令應欽共度耶誕之前夕，並在何氏之晚宴席上致詞，除代表其遠離祖國之部屬，感謝何總司令之佳節盛宴外，並稱吾人能於艱苦作戰獲得勝利之後，在此共度和平以來之第一個耶誕節，實深欣慰。惟未來之世界和平，我中美兩國均負有重大責任。蓋唯有力保永久和平，吾人方無負於業已壯烈犧牲之英勇戰士，故中美兩國必須密切合作，以求此和平之永保，並密切合作，以求中國之安樂與繁榮。今日之晚宴，主人爲何總司令，被邀參加者美方除魏將軍外，有斯達德上校等十餘人，我方被邀者有陳總司令紹寬等三十餘人，宜後何總司令贈魏德邁將軍名貴玉器一匣，並以軍刀十餘柄分贈美方軍官，以誌紀念。</p>

<h3>東北流通券與法幣比率將逐日掛牌　偽滿券及蘇軍票凖備清理</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕關係方面消息，今後東北流通券與法幣將不定固定比率，而由中央銀行逐日掛牌，法幣持有者欲掉換流通券，須向中行申請辦理，一如購買外滙，此項措置，係避免資金大批轉移柬北，影響該區金融物價。前僞滿中央銀行鈔票及蘇聯軍用券，至相當時期，亦將予以收換淸理。法幣在東北之地位，目前因地而異，長春方面行營絕對禁止使用法幣，錦州方面則數量頗大法幣湧往流通，據聞該地法幣與滿幣之比率爲三此一。關於東北貨幣發行情形，據悉僞滿中央銀行發行額前爲八十萬萬元，日本投降後，僞滿政府爲發官員遺散費，增加發行四十萬萬元。蘇軍用券第一批數目爲十萬萬元，以後是否增發不詳，至國府發行東北流通券，目前爲數甚少，本月十三日運長五千萬，廿一日又運去五千萬，共一萬萬元。此種紛歧之現象，錦州中行開幕後，當可消滅。東北行政人員薪金數目，關係社會金融頗鉅，常局經數度之研討後，聞已定簡任官每月九千圓，如東北物價無大波動，此數差堪淸官養廉，東北物價甚低，今後如金融處理得常，社會必易安定。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿四日電〕中央銀行運東北流通券來錦，廿三日已運到廿八箱，廿四日運到十四箱，俟籌備就緒，即可開始營業。</p>
<h3>北平至錦州全綫巡禮</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿二日電〕北寗路暢通至錦州，北方人民在心理上旣獲保障，在經濟上又得以貨暢其流，恢復通商自由，北平通車錦州之翌日，記者自平登車來錦，作全綫視察，車行三日，車內有暖氣備，沿途有中美部隊妥爲保護，四千餘旅客，均以最愉快心情，安全抵達目的地。關內外一千一百九十二華里之鐵路交通，在最困難環境下，能於短期內迅速恢復，是誠爲勝利後最成功之表現。而此不能不有賴於盟軍國軍及農民心心相印之偉大合作，倘無共軍騷擾，恢復日夜行車，則行旅時間，當可减去一半。車自平站開行時，購錦州票者，極爲踴躍，客車達十五輛，平津車行迅速，按時抵達，天津唐山較長一百卅四公里，因路綫修復伊始，的行五小時始抵唐山，鐵路兩側設施，遭共軍破壞，尤其村莊情形，慘不忍覩。軍行抵唐山，係午後五時，旅客留宿唐山，換車前進，唐山客貨雲集，至顯繁榮，時値開灤煤礦公司移回天津，車站上慶祝情形，甚爲熱烈。開灤自始至終，從未停工，五萬工人在敵橋梁，均由美海眾陸戰隊設崗保護。美軍於零下七度在橋口處設帳篷守衛，其艱苦備嘗，每一旅客均極感動，故每當車過鐵橋時，旅客輒伸手軍外，高喊「頂好」。美兵亦含笑以「頂好」答之。北戴河附近廣野，有兩美兵就地修理電話，一中國兒童騎於一人覇據時，極盡保護產業之苦心，據云，每日可出煤九千五百噸，唐山人口廿萬，由國軍盟軍合力維持秩序，地方情形甚安定。唐山附近四十里，時有匪擾，但不足懼，日晨自唐山乘車東行，過古冶。昌黎。蘇縣。北戴河。秦皇島至山海關，沿途七十餘美兵肩上，二兒童席地而坐，注視修理電話情形，車窗遠眺，實爲一幅美麗圖畫，內心深爲感動。午後七時抵山海關，留宿山海關鎭，四周廢墟一片，共軍罪狀歷歷在目，七萬人口正在掙扎中苦度，刦後餘生，述及共軍拉兵槍掠情形，淚如雨下，對國軍拯救之情，尤其對國軍迂廻共軍向關上不發一彈之苦衷，不勝感激涕零。廿日晨換車出關，一百八十二公里費八小時始達，兩側森林平原，肥沃可愛，牛羣。羊羣，處處可見，日人所造之雙軌路綫，已半遷破壞，萬千晨工正在搶修中，沿途小村莊中，尙匿有共軍，但爲數甚少，車行數小站，均見有農民怒焚共軍之邊區鈔票，據吿，鄕間農民，蒙受此鈔票之苦者允衆，此一段路綫轉戰南北健兒，在零下十四度酷寒中嚴密保護爲國爲民之忠情，車中旅客無不深致崇敬。記者出關後，不斷聞有老百姓希望　蔣主席能蒞臨東北之呼聲，國人希治之殷，聲一求瞻仰　領袖豐采之熱情，洋溢於耳目，火車於夜色蒼茫中抵錦城，見有大批部隊開拔前方，三日疲憊，因此令人興奮之情景，遺忘殆盡矣。</p>

<h3>聯合國籌委會結束　大會定下月召集　顧維鈞代表全體致閉幕辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十四日電〕昨日午後五時，（上海時間午前一時）前片刻，聯合國機構第一次全體大會之初步工作，已吿究成。籌備委員會之代表五十一人，自昨晨起即開會，至午後已通過其末次會議之最後數項議程。、　〔中央社倫敦二十三日電〕聯合國籌備委會之各國代表，二十三日下午選顧維鈞爲末次大會之發言人，代表全體致閉幕詞，以表示向第二次世界大戰中首被侵略之我國致偉大敬意。顧氏即席首先代表我代表團對籌委會主席所表示之委會工作之成就，及促成工作迅速樂觀結果之各國代表間之合作精神與熱情，予以讚揚。然後代表全體代表團對籌委會主席秘書及全體人員之領導與協助表示感謝。又對英政府之接待及所　予之便利，致會議能獲偉大成就，深表謝意。顧氏續稱，「吾人深信聯合國大會明年一月開會時，吾人已完成之工作，使將來大會在設立各種主要機構方面，能獲不少便利。處今重大時代中，業已見和平之標記，籌委會之工作業已完成，明年一月十三日，郎可見新世界組織之成立，全體人類之希望，實有以賴之」。</p>
<p>籌建分四階段工作卒底於成　　〔中央社記者任玲遜倫敦廿三日電〔聯合國籌委會本日各項工作之完竣，足示聯合國組織之籌建，業已進抵最後一個階段。聯合國組織之籌建，百分爲四個階段：第一，即頓巴敦橡樹會議，當時中美英蘇四强對於此項世界組織之初步體系，得一般協議，並於本年度二月間雅爾達會議而得以證實。第二階段，由於本年五月廿七日所舉行之舊金山會議而底於成。常時聯合國憲章訂定，而籌備委員會成立。第三個階段係七週之後，於本年八月十六日伊始，籌委會之執委會舉行會議，執委會由澳國。巴西·加拿大·智利·中國·捷克·法國·伊朗·墨西哥·荷蘭·蘇聯·英國·美國及南斯拉夫十四國組成，經過九週之詳細討論，執委會通過一巨幅之報吿，其中包含聯合國組織各重要機構體制之籌組細則，此一報吿成爲籌委會討論之根據。霧委會自本年十一月廿四日開始工作，至本日午後結東，經過四週以上之檢討，籌委會所組之八個技術小組會對於執委會報吿各點，曾作澈底之考嗷，有提出修正者，有未加修正者，有全加駁斥者，惟泰半均經採納。參加執委會者僅十五國，而出席籌委會者達五十一國。</p>
<p>籌委會所作決議之大部最令人興奮者，厥爲獲得一致之贊同，即引起激辯之問題，諸如秘書處之籌組。託管制度之組織，永久地址之選取等，均得圓滿解決，此所以參加義委會全會之大部代表，咸認工作之迅速完成，誠爲佳兆，雅爾達會議舉行時，無人最預測此一世界組織於一年內得以有效工作。舊金山會議中，若干人士咸不信此五十一獨立國家在本年杪以前，對於組織細情能得協議。按照籌委會八個技術小組會最後報吿所作之總報吿，將於明年正月二十日遞呈大會，作最後之審核，其中並包括聯合國大會安全理事會。經濟社會理事會。託管理事會。以及聯合國各重要機構之籌組小組委員會之臨時細則及程序。此外並包括秘書處之組織及聯合國組織之特權問題所作之各項建議，以及行將由聯合國及美政府間對於美國境內設置聯合國「永久地址之特殊地位」所作協定之草案。籌委會最後報吿之序言中，寄予無限之希望，有謂設或籌委會完成工作之精神，能爲一般嚮導，則聯合國組織即可順利建立。設或聯合國組織於其初步措置中，能握住世界各隅之意，則一般寄以厚望之人士，以爲此一組織係使其本身及其後裔，擺脫戰爭桎梏之最後機會，不致失望。</p>
<h3>最後通過　兩小組報</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿三日電〕籌委會全體大會，本晨通過甲種技術小組（負責託管制理事會事宜）及丁種技術小組（負責聯合國全體大會事宜）所提出之最後報吿。甲種技術小組會主席挪代表提出報吿時稱，聯合國之軀穀現已完成，全體大會即可於明年一月十日舉行，討論重要工作，而母需遭受關於程序事宜屢次爭辯之阻攬。捷代表提議通過甲種技術小組之報吿時，讚頌五强之合作相助之態度，卒使甲種技術小組委會之工作。得爲偉大之成功。各代表對有關一切大小國家之各種決議時，均作積極具體之態度，執委會自八月迄十月止，所歷經之數重要爭論，刻均已由全體通過，或至少三分之二之多數票而議決，此實預兆聯合國全體大會之順利前進。丁種技術小組會之最後報吿，本晨亦獲通過，然荷比法國及南非四國代表，仍聲明保留於全體大會中再度討諭此報吿中所提出予託管地之居民權利自由之權利。</p>
<h3>英暹條約　日內可簽字</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕英暹條約可於一二日內簽字，其性質介乎和平條約與停戰協定之間，至於最後之和平條約，須俟暹羅之選舉舉行以後始行簽訂。倫敦官方謂此一過渡條約，乃「協定之言」並將附以附錄，規定其範　及用意。該條約之最後條件，已由英暹代表同意，並悉均已接奉本國訓令準備簽字。又悉，暹羅政府在原則上已表示同意將食米輸往緬甸及馬來亞，惟數量如何，並未在條約上規定。在簽字以前，當亦未能決定，蓋目前之供應狀態，允須經英暹專家之審查也。美國國務院決定撤回反對簽字之要求，使倫敦感覺滿意，倫敦之觀察家認爲美國之疑惑，實係所接獲之「過時消息」所造成。</p>
<h3>韓國旅客談　蘇佔領區狀况</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿三日電〕今日來自蘇軍佔領區之旅客稱；在最近之反共暴動中，韓國共產份子與反共份子曾發生衝突，當時學生八名殞命。據此等旅客謂，在韓國東北部蘇軍佔領之漢亨？（譯音）日本婦孺每日有三十至五十人死亡。蘇方幾已將全部日本男十在漢亨之某區集中，運往西比利亞在煤礦與其他鑛區作强迫勞役。在蘇軍佔領區中，日人所獲之待遇不佳。在韓國北部東段，埋葬死屍之棺木不足，而以稻草米袋充用。此等難民帶來有關蘇方不顧民衆幸福之種種傳說，但蘇方旣拒絕美國記者進入其佔領區，故確吾無法證實。</p>

<p>富人狂歡</p>
<p>平民不免遜色</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕世界已和平，英國人對於各國人士雖具善感，但其戰後第一個聖誕，就家族歡聚及兒童佳節言之，似不能恢復戰前標準。當有之家，已於十一月中旬預先定座，將由倫敦西端旅館餐肆供備，音樂跳舞竟夕在歡，惟普通人民多於七年來作目次團聚，其家庭狀况不免稍感困難，且有不能按照傳統習慣，備辦聖誕節夜燃燒之木柴煤斤者，其有親屬尙在海外，於役禾歸者，亦頗不少，兒童食糧問題，較前稍佳，聞南愛爾蘭有火鷄三十萬頭，巴勒斯坦海法有葡萄三百五十餘萬磅運抵英國。澳大利亞亦允大量增加供應鷄蛋，並將多運茶葉小麥鮮肉鹹肉火腿奶油椰子油糖車　酒及甜酒，聖誕節於食物之外，其次即爲禮物，</p>
<p>禮物玩具</p>
<p>劣貨供應市面</p>
<p>惟本年禮物較戰爭期內之六個圣誕節更稀，有幾家商店大部份依賴舊貨，一方面亟於賣出，一方亦急於買進，昔日最受歡迎之禮品，如手提袋手帕化粧用品匣及掛衣鈎等，均不易購取，即手套手帕亦須犧牲寳貴之配給券，時裝中心龐特街已遭炸彈殘破，雖仍可供應若干專有品，但其價値殊昂，一件舊首飾竟索價數千鎊之巨。某百貨商店設一專櫃，出售舊印刷品。舊地圖。舊航海圖及銅版印刷物等，價値自一鎊起，眞假珠寳飾物，視其價値及大小而異，最低僅値七先令六辦士。游戲用之紙牌殊不易購，兒童玩具亦甚難得，且價昂而貨劣，木製火車質地粗陋，繪漆不精，現皆陳列於各大百貨公司櫉窗中，若在昔時，此種低劣之物決不陳諸座上。有幾種玩具僅祗若干粗糙本片鬆鬆釘在一起而已。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十四日電〕蘇聯對日閃電政擊七天後，即佔薩哈林息南部與千島列島，並努力重行建設，今漁業已恢復並予擴張，工廠絡譯興建，港口便利亦見增加。來自蘇聯西部之蘇方專家與工人，紛紛移往該新地區，預定明年度蘇聯遠東漁業收穫將增一倍。當蘇軍進佔時，發現天然富源，已被竭力開設而不顧將來之損失，致千島列島中部與南部漁業之豐富性，已喪失不少。千島列島北部各島上最　大而完善之設備，已被美機轟毀頗多。在薩哈林島南部則因日軍撤退時取焦土政策，致所剩者一片瓦礫而已。蘇方傳前在千島列島北部與堪察加之日方大漁船，多數已被日人於撤退時取去，惟蘇方現已盡力恢復之，已有裏海與黑海區之蘇方技術人員及漁夫等之先遺隊數百人，到達千島列島與薩哈林島，而蘇方在遠東所建與漁業有關之工業現正加擴充，以應付此薪的需求。海參威等之船塢現正趕造新船，供捕魚之用。</p>
<h3>印度聯盟　昨召開緊急會議　指英國傳統政策未變　魏菲爾下月再晤廿地</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十四日電〕印度聯盟之中央印度委員勃蘭達里，昨在該聯盟召開之緊急會議中聲稱，必須將外國勢力完會逐出亞洲，亞洲始有和平之可言，聯盟秘書梅農之辭有謂，此次會議之召開，在表示吾人之忠于大會黨，及贊助印度之完全獨立。世界大戰並未將和平帶給印度及亞洲，如外國勢力不完全逐出亞洲，則和平永無實現之望。英國之所謂社會主義政府，仍不脫邱吉爾愛梅立時代之作風，最近工黨政府之聲明，足使印度局勢益趨惡化。梅農復謂，英國實無權逮捕印度國民軍人員，吾人堅決反對英人在印度之職權。</p>

<h3>美各報批評　近衛回憶錄</h3>
<p>戰爭戎首不能辭咎</p>
<p>彼所記述誰能置信</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿三日電〕加利福尼亞州各報評論近衛文磨自殺，及其遣著回憶錄中所言，頗多訾議。麥克拉支系之蜂報社論稱，近衛服毒以前，曾提出最後抗議，調彼在三年首相任內力謀和平。就歷史觀之，其言殊難成立。欲明瞭日美戰爭前，日本國內混亂糾紛之局勢，固非數月數年不爲功。然其趨向戰爭之確定步驟，係在近衛任目相時所採取，則顯然可見。一九四一年十二月七日近衛雖已去職，惟炸彈早經製成，祇須有人燃着其火綫而已。侵華戰爭係近衛在任時發生，美國抗議爲近衛所直率拒絕。第三者調停中日戰爭之一切努力，亦爲近衛所打消。德義日三國軍事公約，又係近衛任苜相期內所簽訂。一九四〇年十月五日近衛且曾悍然預言，「美國若不了解日德義訂立同盟之眞意，爲績極合作以創建世界新秩序，則將引起對美戰爭，」此決非愛好和平者之言。試披覽一九三〇至一九四〇年日本歷史，不免使人發生一種印象，當近衛不在首相任內時，日本之軍事侵略，轉顯見弛緩。故近衛之目殺，似非因被控爲戰爭犯而於精神上感受絕大痛苦，殆自知一旦受鞠，且經歷史發表，縱不被認爲戰爭禍首，亦將被判爲日本戰犯罪魁之一。舊金山祀事報社評稱，近衛遺著中謂日外相松岡於簽訂日蘇中立條約時，已知德國有侵蘇計劃，實與事實不符。希特勒之侵蘇消息，使松岡自知受愚，近衛亦未嘗不知之，故留變數日，即行辭職。一九四〇年九月二十七日簽訂之三國同盟，應由近衛負責，一九四一年四月十三日彼與史達林之握手，同年六月二十二日希特勒之侵蘇，其負賣者應爲何人，日本人民自能知之。若謂松岡早知希特勒之意向而自投陷阱，其誰能信。且德國方面亦未必肯將其計劃吿知松岡，德國之輕視其柬方盟國，爲有目共覩。據美國駐日大使格魯謂曾一再令松岡駁斥德國故意欺騙日本之蹬據，松岡雖未公開出此，然或能使近衛信其所爲意在保衛日本地位。</p>

<h3>最可紀念的今日！</h3>
<p>今天，十二月二十五日，是狂歡的耶　節，狂歡之外，中國一般民衆却還印着兩個偉大的意義。</p>
<p>中華民國誕生於一個風雨　搖的時代。在宣佈民主政體不久之後，野心家袁世凱就想將這株新種在荆棘園裏的民主的幼樹，連根拔起，就在牠的根基裏，再種下帝制的刺　，期望他迅即漫延全園。可是，霹靂一聲，察松坡將軍在雲南舉起了義旗，獲得全國民主傾向的人士一致的響應，而高臥在新華宮裏的龍床上，正做着洪憲美夢的袁世凱，終於好夢易醒，御駕昇天，而這早產的帝制運動也就跟着他的御靈烟消製散了。所以，我們可以說，十二月二十五日是象徵着民主中國的奮鬥精神的日子。</p>
<p>此後，皖系直系率系各大軍閥逐鹿中原，四川福建各小軍閥互爭采邑，一塲大小軍閥混戰的局面，把老百姓陷於水深火熱之中。偉大的　蔣主席其時以黃埔軍校校長的地位，弔民伐罪。提仁義之師，　烏合之衆，把惡濁的黑暗勢力一掃而空。却引起了虎視　　的日本的嫉意，放下了　食式的經濟侵略的方式，進一步改採鯨呑式的軍事侵略，遂有萬寳山的動亂，北大營的突襲，而偌大東北河山，就在一夜之問變了顏色。蔣主席深知我國當時準備尙未充足，時機尙未成熟，只得暫時忍辱負重，理首苦幹，當時一般淺識之士，對於蔣主席的一片苦心孤詣，深謀遠慮，不但未能瞭解，反而無的放矢，輕舉妄動，終致　成了魯莽減裂的西安事變。</p>
<p>西安事變是民族興廢的一個重大關　。　主席赤手空拳，周旋於劍拔弩張的叛軍之間，生命危若累卵，而衛隊長蔣孝先以是殉職，參謀長錢大鈞以是受傷，情勢之危急，使全國上下驚惶不安，如受當學。以主席智謀之深，魄力之强，終於在這個可紀念的日子，安然出險。蔣主席大仁大勇的偉大人格，自經這次事變的試鍊之後，從此更顯光芒萬丈，贏得全國人民一致的崇敬與擁護。自蕭溝橋烽火初起，以至芷江日軍接治投降，經八年之抗戰，中國民氣能够保持國結一致，始終勿渝，主席處理西安事變之感召力，實在是一種主要的原動力。在蔣主席西安出險的第九年紀念日，讓我們向這位唯一偉大的領袖致最敬禮！（張德乾）</p>
<h3>冬暖夏涼的一塊勝地　海南島風光如舊　海陸空交通綱正在積極發展中</h3>
<p>這是日寇投降五閱月後的海南島的風光。</p>
<p>從飛機塲到海口—海南島首邑—你會看到奇怪的景象，就是車輛在城外是靠左走，城內却已實施「向右走」的新規。這就是所謂漸變。海南島的道路很健全。這大概是因爲沒有重噸車輛行駛之故吧！敵人日本在過去數年中　意經營，妄想把海南島建成遠東最强固的海軍根據地，所以他們第一步就是整頓島上的交通綫。這周圍二百五十英里的孤島，交織着現代化的水泥公路，使重噸的軍用率可以在道裏來往搬運軍需品。</p>
<p>四大機塲　分據軍事要點</p>
<p>綿延修長的鐵道綱啣接島上各要點。在這圓形的島上兩大幹綫垂直交叉。島上還有四大機塲，分據軍事要點，設備堪稱完美</p>
<p>現在事過境遷，鐵路車輛大都在此次戰爭後遭受了損壞，煤斤已吿用罄，車站停車塲到處是頹垣殘壁。機車也因不用而生銹，全無生氣的站立着。鐵道寬度似乎也不合現代的需要。</p>
<p>汽油的恐慌，麻痹了大部份的公路交通。</p>
<p>海南島的繁榮，一向是倚靠進出口的物資。但是現在進口的船隻，杳無消息，原因是怕觸碰海面的水雷。船隻的缺少，當然也是重要原因。船舶的殘骸點綴着各處港口，目前旣無法打撈，又無從修理。</p>
<p>海上航運　瓊僑認係福音</p>
<p>要復蘇勝利的海南島，最重要的當然是商業的復興。同時，要恢復商業，必須先恢復交通，使海南島可以和外界接觸。目前海南島是處於半隔離的狀態。</p>
<p>先說海上交通：在戰前，海口對外的海運是很發達的，其時有定期的航輪，常川行駛華南大陸沿岸等港口，以及東京　，越南，新加坡，暹羅，菲律賓等地，旅客極爲稱便。及至日本侵入海口來了後，遂陷人停頓形熊，而現在，瓊崖是光復了，一切都呈現着新生的現象。旅居廣州灣的義民，亦都紛紛的買棹歸來。海口廣州灣問的航運，又恢復起來了，不過由於輸船的欠便，暫時只有帆船行駛，的每二三天行駛一次。至於速率，如果順水行卅，一帆風順的話，只須二十四小時便能抵達，來往的船費，約二三千元。聞現在正擬恢復香港，廣州等地航運中，這又是一般旅客的福音。</p>
<p>陸路交通　全綫千餘公里</p>
<p>其次，說到陸路交通，話又說回來了，我們瓊崖陸路交通，因各縣公路的完成，汽東交通頗稱發達，而海口亦成爲交通的出發點，土產，洋貨的集散　以此爲中心。至車之種類，有自動車，人力車，馬車，牛車等。統計全瓊環海縱橫路綫，一共二十三條，通車路程延貫一千四百七十四基羅，陸路父通之利便，可見一斑。其後復經一度修整，增設各縣村洛支綫，更稱利便，而値得我們汪意的，尤是從三亞建築至北黎一七五基羅長之鐵路，惟因缺少煤炭，極少通車，而現在敵人是投降了，交通本來是　利便的。不過，在西路方面，盜匪時有出沒，仍不能　　。東路比較安靖，汽車照當行駛，惟因現在行駛汽車不多，搭客又非常擁擠，每車差不多都有二十人左右，車側車蓬都立坐着人。車主只以綫爲目的，完全不顧到搭客的死活，現瓊崖當局對此，已有命令取締，以保搭客安全。至於　費，由海口至嘉積，已由七百元而漲至五千元了，這使一般搭客起了「有家歸不得」之感。</p>
<p>利用機塲　航空業務必榮</p>
<p>說到航空方面，從前有歐亞民機，從廣州經茂各至海口，及至日軍侵入後，將海口原有之機場，擴大數倍。文昌，臨高，嘉積，昌江及三亞等地，亦增設機場，其中以海口機場最大，三亞次之，設備亦頗完善，目前尙無民航機飛航。我們預料上述機場一旦加以利用後，航空事業上當即順利發展。</p>
<p>瓊崖的海·陸·空·交通·大概如上所述，目前雖然欠「便」但來日可因陸綫機塲的增加，而益趨繁榮與利便，那是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>主要的出口貨，是水菓。花生汕·糖·和咖啡，進口貨則以米和製造品爲大宗。島上產米很少，向來仰給于法　越南。目前交通斷絕，在外人的印象中，島民彷彿全是以賣香蕉度日的小販。</p>
<p>藍海黃沙　一片熱帶風光</p>
<p>海口市似乎蟄伏在熱帶的日光下，樹木繁茂，棕樹在微風下擺動，充分表示然帶的風光。蔚藍的海水，冲刷着黃沙的海岸，湧出白色的泡沫。</p>
<p>島上的商業範圍極小，僅以本島爲限。路上的汽車，爲數寥寥。生活程度也很低。但是表面上，島民似乎對于他們的生涯很滿足。</p>
<p>島上生活，的確極爲靜穆安寧。路角上，設立着許多小咖啡館。一杯牛奶咖啡，售價法幣廿五元。光顧這些咖啡館的，大都是赤脚的女子，她們勞動回來，坐着談天，休息。島上現暫時實施戒嚴，每晚十時後，不准通行。街頭密佈着武裝步哨。</p>
<p>法國色彩　佔　全城優勢</p>
<p>這裏的建築物深染着法國色彩。新的建築物大都馬日本式，雖然日人已有不少被拘入郊外的集中營，但街上仍可不時見到男男女女的日本人。最先遣送回籍的，大概是被敵人强徵來的一萬五千名華工。</p>
<p>天主敎在島上佔着絕大的優勢。矗立城內的宏偉淸潔的紅十字會醫院，和許多小學校，都是天主教的成績。海關公署是島上最新式的建築，構造得相當精緻。</p>
<p>空襲的損書，限子港口和飛機場等建築。海口城內，已經看不出過去空襲的遺痕。</p>
<p>島上的食糧問題，自前尙不十分嚴重，米糧存底漸漸稀薄，每祖的法幣二萬五千元。當局現正致力復興救濟工作。委員長和國父的照像到處可見。</p>
<p>在過去，本島的燃料，在日軍投降後所存煤斤，現在已經用　，當力亦已吿竭。所幸的是島上有豐當的森林。燃料問題當可不成問題。在目前，大部的島民都採用油燈。</p>
<p>避寒勝域　不久可望實現</p>
<p>島民受着蛇疫的威脅，但在同時，蛇却是菜盤裏當做一種佳餚的。其他的山珍海味，是灼狗肉和海蜇，其味頗似花生醬。</p>
<p>這兒是一個冬暖夏凉的佳境，在冬天，即以目前十二月而說，氣候也只在華氏七十五度，令人感到相當的溫和舒服，絕對沒有所謂寒浪的侵襲。</p>
<p>在不久的將來，我想，海南島可能會變成理想中的我國避寒的勝域。（黎明）</p>
<h3>美軍在東京　本報編譯室譯自十二月號生活雜誌</h3>
<p>勤勞的日本人民，已將日本被炸城市中災區最廣的東京市內廢墟瓦礫，掃除一淸。各種車輛，也早在一部份未被炸毀的現代化都市中心區街道上恢復行駛了。日本議會，籌備在舉行臨時普選會議時，在東京召集有選舉權之女性二千一百萬人，她們都是初次獲得選舉權的一羣。本土駐軍三百萬人，除掉少數沒有勛章的聯絡部隊外，已經全部復員。國外的日軍總數，還有六百萬。麥克阿瑟統帥借撥坦克登陸用船一百艘與日本，每月可遺送日軍十萬人回國。日本的徵兵制已被麥帥下令撤銷，麥帥同時更查獲了兩萬五千萬美元的一筆鉅款，這筆款子，是陸海軍部隱瞞了政府而私自　過的，富士山上日本的遊客，已經有五年沒有上去過，可是現在呢，美國的花旗，也在牠的頂巔上飄揚起來啦。</p>
<p>神道主義現況</p>
<p>沒有受戰時犧牲的人很多，因爲他們始終和日本內地發生接觸，他們有些是到內地去躱避滿炸的。本年冬季，還有許多人可以荀延殘喘，他們可以往鄕下跑，那邊的食糧，比都市內要充裕得多。</p>
<p>日本現在是被擊敗了，而且正被一個美國軍官嚴格地統治着，但日本人如終還是和以前一般，並沒有什麼兩樣。麥帥已把日本的神逍主義廢除，無論是在學校，政府神社內，一概不准存在。祇有有關個人或家庭方面的神這敎，才不致受到干涉。日本人至今仍向他們的神道天帝和神社，行着鞠躬禮。可是某日本　法學專家，却作着令人該異的宣吿說：「日島本人，並不相信他是神道教內太陽神的後裔。」</p>
<p>曾經掀起宮韓革命，反抗軍閥集團的日皇，現在並沒有得到什麼利益。他的私產，據估計，達一萬萬元，還有地產三百二十萬英畝，如今已和六十七個男女皇族的資產，同時遭受凍結。現在，他年支四十萬元的預算，要經過美國人的詳細計核。日本的賠償額，可能達到三百三十萬萬元，他個人也許要負一部份賠款支付責任，可是日本的歲收，祗及到這筆鉅數的百分之一。</p>
<p>日警生活改觀</p>
<p>在東京，最顯著而有意義的，是警察職位的改革。日本的警察們，一向用恐怖的手段統治着人民。日本的警察，對於要逮捕的人，祗消命令他怎採走，怎樣轉灣，怎樣自動地跟着跑，被捕的人，也往往唯命是聽。日本人向警士們問路時，總是鞠躬如議，到如今，他們還是這樣，上星期美國反諜報部的長官，尖銳地指斥日本警察，不應採取恐怖方法和不法的充公行爲。在美人目中看來，日本警察的行爲，同時證明他們的無禮，丟臉，和不道德</p>
<p>婦女與巧克力</p>
<p>美軍士兵要在東京解決他們的女人問題，比任何地方都容易，逍個問題，時常可在皇宮禁苑隔壁的日比野公園內順利解決，可作爲對　的女人，旣非司空見慣的藝妓，又非俯拾即是的下女或娼婦，却都是脫離家庭管束的人家婦女，其例行工作，便是敎她們一些必要的英語，給她們一些吃的東西，好像巧克力糖和水果等東西，就足够對付了。到目前爲止，日本男子們，對於這種行徑，還有憤怒的表示。</p>
<p>美國政府規定美金日圓兌換率的失策，使美軍士兵們，瀕於個人破產的境地。美軍士兵的薪餉，是按照規定車十五作一發給的（即一塊日圓等於六分半美金）可是，黑市兌換率，因四個月來日幣通貨從兩百七十萬萬膨漲到四百四十萬萬圓的緣故，一元美金，的可換得七十日圖，一個美兵消磨一個沒有酒的夜生活，需要廿元美金。</p>
<p>美國新舞盛行</p>
<p>軍隊裏的人，可以免費旅行，可以在美軍所辦的百貨商店內購買紀念品。他們最佳的財產是紙烟，如果可以通過憲兵的干涉的話，每包紙烟，可換取美金兩元。日本的妓院，有一部份准許存在。東京的舞女們，已學會了美國的新式舞。（Jitterbug）但她們鬧着要罷工，她們說：她們跳新式舞的代價，僅僅一碟甜山芋是不够的。艾却爾勃虬將軍爲解決美軍的娛樂問題，已計劃一個浩大的運動節目，包括棒球。足球。滑氷和曲棒球。</p>
<p>東京冬景一瞥</p>
<p>東京有廿五萬人住着茅房陋屋，有成千累萬的人，還無屋可住，他們都睡在公園裏，本年冬季，米糧也惑不足。黑市已漲到四元兩毛半美金一磅。（戰前兌換率計算），一九四一年的米價，是每磅四分美金。日本官方宣稱：將有八百萬人凍餓而死，美國當局認爲此數未免誇張，可是死亡率之高，是勢所必然的。</p>
<p>爲支付食糧的進口，日皇裕仁計劃着將他價値四百萬美元的珍珠寳藏拍賣掉，美國强迫着日人將可耕的土地重新分配一下，把日本三分之一的無主耕地，售給佃農們耕耘。雖說這種辦法可以對將來的財富分配有所協助，可是本年冬季內，實在沒有財富可資分肥。飛機轟炸結果，日本的大工業祗殘賸百分之廿五，失業人數，的有一千萬人！</p>
<p>在這些情形之下，民間的不滿和缺乏休養，是難於避免的。日本的三十六個政黨內，最有組織和最有條理的，要算蕞爾的共產黨了。日本的共黨，和莫斯科並無關係，這是日本唯一要求廢置日皇的政黨。雖然如此，他們仍需要從傳統上自謀解放，因爲某一女性共戴份子在表示她對日　的意見時，她還流着淚呢。</p>
<p>睡在公國條凳上的流浪者，他們正在過乞丐和小偸生活。</p>
<p>復員後的日軍參謁東京神社時，美軍派兵站崗，禁止美軍行近。</p>
<p>日比野公園內，美兵和日本婦女在湖濱喁喁坐談，遠眺對面，便是麥帥總部的巨厦。</p>
<p>美國婦女學習工業設計打樣</p>
<p>美國在戰前，家庭用傢俱及設備，大抵均由男十設計打樣，現時婦女從事此新興工業設計打樣業者日衆。</p>
<p>圖示：美國婦女在支加哥美專學校工業設計打樣部實習情形。該校於過去四年中，訓練女生人數之增加率，已超過百分之七十五以上。學生在打樣部先受簡單之美術莫樣訓練逐漸學習正式作業。圖中女生，正用鐵鑽子裝　椅上把手之一部。</p>
<h3>亞洲工業化根據地　東北之新發展</h3>
<p>日本在東北所建立的工業帝國將由中國承受下來了。這一宗產業當算爲日本侵佔中國應使賠償的一部分，同時也足以爲中國開始工業化打開一個機會。東北工業曾有日本數十萬萬元投資。此刻鋼鎭，化學，機械，人造汽油，木材等工業，都並沒有遭受戰重破坯。這次中國接收無須償付日本所有主任何代價，因爲工業的所有權大部分原都在日本政府經營的公司乎裏。東北產業轉移的情形，美國十分注意，原因如左：</p>
<p>中國接收東北工業以後，日本人所辦的經理工作一定轉入華人之手，因此也許美國的經理人員與工程師將應召協助經營。同時，不論是經營或山中國轉讓給任何個人或公司如何籌措經費，也是一個問題，也許中國將布望美國投資。再說，這一新工業的生產品的市塲，是一個基本問題，也許美國的經濟家將應聘爲中國設計東北工業生財的最好辦法。</p>
<p>這裏有一個相當復雜的因素。蘇聯對南滿鐵路享有一半主權（按中蘇條約規定長春鐵路歸由中蘇合營），它也許對產權路局所有的東北工業要求分佔所有權。路局會辦有礦塲，工廠航務，電話，電報等許多產業。東北的工業當能謹愼地發展。（美新譯）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本民主化的陰影</h3>
<p>麥克阿瑟元帥以盟軍最高統帥佔領日本以來，爲時僅三月有餘，以沈着的姿態，對處理戰後日本的措施，逐漸展開。如戰犯的分批逮捕，財　的解體，日本個農關係的改善，以及神道教與國體的分離等等，或是直接有關戰爭責任的淸算，或爲民主的新日本奠下了良好的基礎。在這樣短的時期內，而有如此成績，我們不能不深佩麥帥才能的卓越。日昨聯合社及合衆社從東京傳來消息，謂麥帥總部宣稱，建設新日本之基礎工作業已完成，日本古老之封建機構已告剷除。這報告是否可靠，不無問題，若使眞有其事，也頂多只能認爲麥帥總部的一個非官式的觀測。在日本民主化的過程中，目前代表日本封建制度最高機構的皇室還依舊存在，我們自不能因日本個農關係的改善，財閥的解體，乃至神道敎與國體的分離，而遽認爲「日本古老之封建機構已吿剷除。」因爲日本的皇室是日本封建制度的中心；皇皇未除，豈可謂封建機構已吿劃除？</p>
<p>關於日本皇室的存廢問題，目今意志似未一致。對日本問題有資格的觀察家，或王張廢，或主張存，自然各有理由。大抵英國方而保守人士一般意向，多認爲日本皇室爲人民崇敬的中心，事實上僅是傀儡，並不直接參與政治，應予保留，俾可以皇室爲中心，遂漸建立民主體制。這原是英國「現實主魏者」的看法。他們以爲日本皇室一朝廢止，全煙或將入於無政府的狀熊。這一種論調，在美國方面似乎也頗有力。可是在英國在美國，同時也根有一部分人主張日本皇室應即廢止，在民主的新日本次不容許有皇皇的存在。中國一般的意向，都認爲日本皇室應予廢止；雖然中國政府對日本皇室的存廢問題，到今天爲止。從來沒有發表過官式的聲明。</p>
<p>目下對於處理日本皇室的問題，停滯在這樣一個階段。波茨頓宜言裏沒有明白提到日本皇窒問題；日本在接納波茨頓宜言時會提出條件，要求保留皇室；但杜魯門總統的答書裏面，亦沒有接受日本的條件，僅言日本的皇室須受盟軍最高統帥的節制。主要盟國在處理日本皇窒問題上，只有消極性的一致，還沒有積極性的協調。這事實在不應這樣拖延下去！</p>
<p>我們認爲在日本民主化的過程中，皇室制度必須消滅，不能讓其再行存在。雖據東京電稱，麥帥總部高級官員暗示，設或日皇能獨具慧眼，設法解決米荒及失業問題，並遵循麥帥所施諸日本之民主體制，使日人獲得合理完善之政府，則日皇及其制度可得保持永久，並且日皇裕仁本人盼將遜位一事取決於日本人民，但日本皇室的存廢，而今已不僅僅是一個日本的內政問題，可以　日本人民自己決定，而是一個國際問題，應該由聯合國出來決定。我們不宜健忘！須知東條近衛都是拜受了皇皇的「大命」而組織政府的，從法理上講，日本皇皇是這次侵略戰中最大的戰犯，無論就侵華說，或就英美說，都應該負發動第二次世界大戰的全責。如今戰事終了，我們首當劃除這不僅貽害日本人民而且破壞世界和平的萬惡制度。日本皇室，與英國的王室，原是兩種根本不同的體制。英國政府的產生決定於民意，國王不負實際組織政府的責任。但日本的東條近衛之出來組織政府，並不是由於國會的支持，而是拜受了「大命」，况且陸海軍部又直接聽受日皇的命令，內閣對它們無權過問，故日皇對政治是直接負責的，我們不能將日皇英王視同一例。日本皇室是這次戰爭的最高指揮者。不問中國政府目前的意向如何，中國人民有權指陳日本皇室爲日本戰犯的首魁，並要求在戰後新日本的建設中皇窒制度應予廢止。</p>
<p>從聯合國的立塲來說，發動了中美英蘇的四國之力，將敵寇打倒了，若讓皇室制度依然存在，徒爲將來種着禍根。日本人民的心理中，向來存留着極深的神道迷信，以爲他們是神的選民，他們負有統治世界的神聖使命，就是爲了這種使命，他們發動了「大東亞戰爭」。他們自詡的「大束亞戰爭」雖然遭到擊潰，但若令皇室制度存在，可使日本人民有一種錯覺，以爲他們「神聖的使命」僅一時受些頓挫，還有待於將來的完成。集中美英蘇四國之力，而尙不能將皇室制度剷除，將使日本人民更加相信他們的皇室之「受命於天」，增加共自大在，而重爲世界的禍祟。麥帥將日本的神道敎與國體分離，原是極明智的措施，但如神道敎信衆中的「神」依舊讓它存在，讓它做日本政治上的統治者，則今後的日本恐仍將不是民主的日本，而依然爲一「神」主的日本，「八紘一宇」的天皇的日本。這實在足爲世界和平的隱憂！</p>
<p>爲世界持久和平計，爲日本人民利益計，皇窒制度的存在，終是日本民主化的一個陰影。我們應該廓淸這個陰影，然後世界及日本才能獲得光明。</p>

<p>烚赤昨人心續俏，美鈔在廠商及進口商大量扒結下，遂步上昇，刺激金市，證券帮中頗多脫股購金者，逐漸迫成軋空局面，自晨初七六萬八後，買戶接踵而來，求過於供下，午刻已穿出八〇萬大關，最後盤旋於八一萬左右，較上週六漲起五萬二，一般輿論對外匯率主張不應過高（市價以下），一般人心亦頓改舊觀，以致黃金美鈔需求更殷，前途恐將盤好，銀樓飾金掛八萬六，紋銀六百元，銀元仍在四五〇元左右盤旋，暗拆需求雖殷，但供源亦湧，仍站住八分至一角間。</p>
<p>美鈔因陪都行市轉堅，加之傳聞自由商輪今晨進口者極多，紗廠帮及進口商爭先扒結下，籌碼因而顯見枯竭，自晨開一二八〇元低價，愈盤愈好，迨穿出一三〇〇元大關後，情勢愈見堅定，廠方需求更湧，業中人被迫頗多趁高拋出者，於是午刻紛紛補進，午後更形俏利，最後一三八〇元之價尙多需求，較上週六漲起一百二十餘元，港票亦隨之而穩，結果老貨好五元，新貨升三元</p>
<h3>華股銳氣已減　公債漸趨下游　外股漲風仍未息</h3>
<p>公債因業中人興趣轉向股票，拉　乏人，丙種上塲即破入七百元內，繼而盤跌至六五〇元以下，散戶尙圖一逞，中途雖有拉上，但未能重出七百元大關，午刻仍因浮多脫手，降至六四〇元左右，結果較上週六續降五十五元至九十元不等，雜牌差價因而軋近，市况殊爲平淡。</p>
<p>華股初以前日證券公會開會幷不順利，人心稍感失望，大戶頗多脫股換金者，形成供過於求之態，紗廠自七四〇元退至六九〇元，美亞自五七〇元退至四八〇元內，入後金市漲勢有所刺激，證券帮大戶仍來吸收，最後復見回　至五百元及七百元大關外，形勢尙堅，但籌碼未見十分緊臻，（試觀本月十五日紗廠對黃金比價爲一千五百餘股，今晨祗需一千股略强），結果較之上週六計巨型股紗廠微升美亞略挫，小型股新光平景福勸興各漲一元半，冷門老股仍在實力派搜購下，飛漲不已。</p>
<p>外股熱門尙稱穩健，求供相埓，全市盤旋而已，客帮及證劵帮逢低仍有納胃，結果怡和再漲一百元，怡啤及紙業均昇三十元，其餘冷門各股稍見遜色。</p>
<p>紗綫隨金價上升</p>
<p>昨日紗市尙稱平穩，因金價頻頻報高，致各種紗綫隨之升起一萬元之譜，雖川帮對二十支特雙馬金鷄等老牌重磅貨頗有進胃，漲至六十五萬，然其餘二十支各牌紗綫兜售有人，成交不多，十六支紗同行買賣尙不寂寞，人心未見十分榮欣，脚地似未見穩固。</p>
<h3>白煤塊又騰漲　柴炭行市參差</h3>
<p>白煤節塊，納胃頗盛，重見高翔，白煤屑煤球廠方將獲平價配給，納胃轉呆，價略趨疲，烟煤屑交易閑散，行情平軟，柴船到埠較前爲少，價略堅穩，炭到貨仍湧，市似微挫。</p>
<p>昨日同盟輪，由天津裝來煤斤七百噸外，又有中山號貨輪，係美國總統輪船公司經理，自秦皇島裝來九千噸，昨日下午三時許抵滬，停泊浦東藍烟囪碼頭。</p>
<h3>米跌油漲</h3>
<p>黃豆生仁豆餅均俏</p>
<p>米市消化淸淡，粳秈平均疲二三百元，白元以丹陽來貨裝運抵申三五百包，河下輪運到申亦有二三百包，靑島帮暫停，市形回小六七百元，麵粉北洋去化甚旺，再升二百餘元，形勢趨挺，油市以甬帮舟山續進，依然挺秀，再升數百至千元，本街因平油關係，仍然清懈，黃豆閩。浙進胃仍續，價再漲三四百元，後情仍堅，生仁冬季本街另銷轉殷，供不應求，再漲一二千元，豆餅台灣去化接續，汕頭動辦異常俏俐，續漲二百元，酒市店方納胃亦佳，見升五百元，勢成疲而轉挺</p>
<h3>同盟號輪　裝到大批北貨　海味互有升降</h3>
<p>駛往天津裝貨之同盟船已到埠，裝來烟葉四百餘件，胡桃紅棗及什貨等二千餘件。</p>
<p>石碼大片生晒圓肉，昨聞建帮號家已有十餘箱運到，此間尙係初次獻新。</p>
<p>徐州金針菜因產量不多，市似略升，而福建廣東銷胃尙佳。</p>
<p>明王參到貨殊尠，胡椒前市報升，今以銷寂市乃趨平，茴香銷路漸緩，市吿回跌，冬菇因香港帮採辦，再以已當時令（年菜），價遂上升，笋干到貨尙衆，銷路正待開展。</p>
<h3>染織廠可望復蘇</h3>
<p>中小型染織廠，於抗戰勝利前，受敵僞統制電力綦嚴，自經濟部規定生產用電後，爲求獎勵生產計，不予限制，故已紛紛接電開工，隴海綫四川長江各帮已動，各廠染色遂形忙碌非凡，由此推測，染織業復蘇有望。</p>
<h3>四行兩局今日照常營業</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕今日民族復興節及雲南起義紀念，本市銀行公會會員銀行循例休業一天，惟本市中中交農四行及中信郵匯兩局，昨奉財政部駐京滬區財政金融特派員辦公處令，根據重慶向例，仍照常營業，各商業銀行則無變更，又財政部京滬區金融特派員陳行氏，前赴京晋謁蔣主席述職後，昨已返滬。</p>
<h3>賬面資金意見　市商會尙在討論中</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕工商業僞幣帳面資本金額折合問題，業經會計師公會市商會及各專家分別討論，迄未有具體辦法，市商會所組織之工商法規研究委員會，曾組設小組委員會研究其事，僉以二百作一之收兌僞券辦法，固不適於帳面資本之折合，而此外實未有相當標準，可資推行，數日前曾分函各業同業公會徵求意見，以便彙總，然後酌定標準，向主管機關建議，日來各業公會已紛紛將此項意見書送交市商會，聞市商會對此問題仍在鄭重討論中，據染織業及棉布業同業公會負責人談稱，前會計師公會所假定之三項辦法，尙値得贊同。惟帳面資本金額折合後所得之假盈餘，政府如亦須嚴課所得稅及利得稅。是不啻虛帳實課，本市工商業當不能忍受，故主張向政府建議，對於此項稅收，應變通辦理，以免經營者在核算帳面資本金額時，多所顧忌云。</p>

<h3>耶誕足球義賽　東華新陣容　迎戰英海軍</h3>

<p>查東華此次得前聯誼三劍客宋靈聖，鄭英權，劉顯漢加入，陣容之整齊，一時無二，唯今日前鋒錢上以韓龍海之受傷，將由賈幼良之右移鋒位，而由陳明哲踢右翼，此在攻勢方面，不免略减。黑王子隊在滬上英軍方面，可稱首屈一指，故東華遇之，勢必有一塲惡鬥。</p>

<h3>中國木刻展覽會　將在倫敦舉行</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿四電〕由於英國議會及中國消息報道部之合作，倫敦行將舉行一中國木刻展覽會。此會之目的，乃在使英國之藝術界了解戰時中國木刻之意義，以及中國木刻如何在困艱環境中保持其藝術價値。是項木刻，乃爲重慶木刻薩術界協會所收集，多數木刻家，實非以木刻爲職業，而祗取木刻爲業餘之消遣。木刻中所表示者，乃中國之現實生活，故而此展覽會在文化上，藝術上，以及敎育上，均有深刻之意義。</p>
<h3>我國圕人才的搖籃　武昌文華圖書館學專校　在重慶嘉陵江北岸建立起了新的堡壘</h3>
<p>『私立武昌文華岡書館學專科學校」，不是一個十分陌生的名字。無論在大江南北，只要一提起「文華」，沒有一個不曉得的，它和它的前身——武昌文華大學，在中國敎育界有過燦爛的紀錄，爲中國作育了不少人才，它的聲譽在國外與『淸華」『聖約翰』同樣被人珍視，認爲中國唯一有權威與悠久歷史的圖書館人才的訓練機構。今日從事於圖書館事業的，十之八九都直接間接出於「文華』的搖籃。</p>
<p>隨軍西撤</p>
<p>抗戰以後，「文華』隨軍西上，從武昌遷到重慶，在曾家岩求精中學校園裏，找了幾幢房子，繼續上課，不幸到了三十年夏天，被敵機炸毀，迫不得已，又要另尋安置，終於由師生們的奮鬥，不到一年，在嘉陵江的北岸，一個人烟稀少的鎭旁，建立起了新的堡壘。</p>
<p>廖家花園是個慶蕪已久的小園，三年來，不斷的經營，墾殖，已經是個美麗的小天地了。一塊綠油油的三角地，矗立著三五幢房子，一年四季有各種花草招待遠近的遊客，像春天的桃李，夏天的夾竹桃，秋天的桂菊，冬天的二梅，使這一塊小天地，終年盛裝，鶴立於江北的羣山中。</p>
<p>逐漸擴充</p>
<p>初到廖園，那時只有一統問房子，上課，吃飯，集會，睡覺，都在那裏面。三年來，一幢幢蓋了起來，今天，已經很够應用了，寬敞的禮堂，廣大的圖書館，舒適的課室和睡房，使學生們生長在一個安定的生活裏。近又添裝了電燈，格外使這小小的園子生色不少，每到晚上，遠遠望去，點點燈火，交織成一幅美麗的夜景，學生們所以今天能够安適地弦歌不輟，首先要歸功於老校長沈祖榮先生。他是賢明的領導者！有着奮鬥的精神超人的毅力！</p>
<p>內部分科</p>
<p>該校現分二科：圖書館學，和檔案管理。肄業的學生連今年暑假新招的二班，共只五班，計七十人，他們都是來自各省的熱忱靑年，全受過高中以上的敎育，對於這兩種新興科目，都抱有絕大的信心。他們在校，須學習二年實際的理論與技術。如同：圖書館經營法，行政學，中西編目法，中西目錄學，分類學，各種分類法，定購法，參考工作，參考書，序列法，索引術，檢字法，檔案經營與行政，檔案編目，中西檔案學，資料管理，史籍整理，人事管理，公文研究，打字，實習……等等，和各科概論，國文，英文，第二外國語（德文，日文，法文），統計二年內，要習滿一百學分。畢業前呈繳畢業論文，經敎授會通過，方准畢業。</p>
<p>專家任課</p>
<p>該校任課敎授，關於專門學科，全由國內圖書館學權威和檔案專家擔任。上年度增聘李湧泉氏授博物館學，本年又增聘陸華深，李永增二氏，擔任圖書館經營法與行政學選購等科目，足見學校當局，雖在經濟極度爲難之情形下，還在不斷地延攬良師增强陣容。</p>
<p>除對專門課程外，學校當局並深切注重同學對外國語之學習，如英文會English　Speaking　Society之組織，其目的在使同學將所學用之實際使用，以校正其拼音，語氣，姿熊習慣之錯誤，養成習慣，而逐漸致之於正途。若千課程如編目法，參考書，目錄學，檔案學等，亦採取原本圖書，以英語講解。又如放映影片圖書Microfilm　Reading等等，以訓練其視聽之能力。凡此種種設施均足促成同學之長足進步。</p>
<p>添置新書</p>
<p>圖書館在這圖書館學專科學校裏，似乎更形活躍，除了整天忙着給敎授們蒐集材料和帮助同學選擇參考用書及解答間題外，更須要做一個工作，做一示範，因此它較之普通一般圖書館又多一重職責。在經費獨立的原則下，圖畫館的新書源源的流入來，而且不息的流通着，如同太陽的遝行一樣，使每一讀者有迅速享受新書的權利與機會。最近英美大使館，送贈了很多圖書，而美國圖書館協會與各圖書館學學校又捐贈該校大批圖書，這將更增加該校圖書館的效率。</p>
<p>該校對於圖書館學與檔案學的研究，曾有研究部之設，八年來，可說沒有片刻停息，有很多新的發見和創作。可惜因爲戰時物力艱難，無法付印問世，供圖書館界的參考。現在抗戰勝利結束，他們正預備在這一方面努力，在最近的將來，當有一番貢獻。現在主其事的，是留美圖書館學碩士徐家麟敎授。</p>
<p>將回武昌</p>
<p>復員是目前最迫切的一件事，誠如蔣主席說復員不是復原，據悉，「文華」不但要搬回武昌，而且要擴大成院，並且要設立一個示範性質的圖書館，永遠走在人的前面，相輔領導中國圖書館事業的發展。可是碩大的中國，需人太多，人才太少，爲了要訓練人才，爲了要建設圖書館需要人才，更須要若干高級人才和師資。據聞英美圖書館界，爲了帮助我國圖書館之建設，已紛紛設立研究生學額，以供我國圖書館學者之深造。我國有關當局亦已注意及此，將於最近年來，逐年考選圖書館學學生出國。該校副敎授徐家璧氏，且已於上月初出國赴英，考察英國圖書館事業，並將順道赴美考察圖書館學敎育云。</p>

<h3>狂歡聖誕日　應念流離人</h3>
<p>— 本報記者潔</p>
<p>我們都是新人，在上海每個角落里生長，頹廢腐化，黑暗墮落，這糜爛的生活，如今要英勇的淸償！同志們，今天快把頭腦身體來鍛鍊，明犬就是國家有用的棟樑，醒醒吧！醒醒吧！一起走上敎室奔工廠，禮義廉恥，光明磊落，是學習的準繩，頹廢腐化，黑暗墮落，在工作中掃光！同志們！努力吧！我們都是新人，是　設新中國的力量！</p>
<p>在這一片熱烈雄壯的歌聲中，我們看到近千的一羣急待社會慈善人士救濟的難民難童，使我非常的感動！抗戰勝利後的第一個聖誕節前夜，全上海都沉醉在狂歡的漩渦裏—也許不會注意到在都市極僻靜的一角，漕河涇上海市救濟院難民難童收容所，他們雖然也在舉行一個慶祝聖誕節的同樂會，但還有睡在病牀上沒有人去同情哀憐帮助的四十多個可憐的難胞！</p>
<p>八年來的砲火，也許已養成了人們殘酷的心裏，對於這慘絕人寰的現實，雖也曾震盪一時心情，過後也就像流水烟　，成爲過去，淡然遺忘。看到大酒店大舞廳大劇塲冠蓋雲集，賓至如歸，紙醉金迷的聚舉塲面，和牆角邊的倒斃者，成了强烈的對照，令人憶想到古人「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍屍骨」的悲吟，這該是誰的責任？</p>
<p>許多人，對於所謂癟三，乞丐小偸之流，只有憎恨，厭惡和鄙業，而沒有同情，悲憫和悲愛，這人羣的一角，永遠爲社會所遺棄，過着悽慘的非人生活。人類究竟是萬物之靈，是偉大的，是博愛的，要不是迷失了本性，誰也不應該蔑視他們的悲慘遭遇，我敢肯定的說：他們之所以成爲社會餘渣，這不是他們的罪惡，也不是他們的責任！</p>
<p>上海難民難童收容所，過去是世界紅卍字會主辦的流民習勤所，在僞府期間，曾被改爲「勞動營」，勝利後又成了國軍的營舍，佔地九十七畝强，在十月二十六日社會局舉命接收，到十一月一日正式開始收容上海市難民難童，在短短的時期中，他們動員了自己的力量除去了沒脛的蔓草，成堆的瓦藥，從荒蕪的泥土上建立起幽雅的，美麗的境地，第一個使人感覺好感的便是井井有條的佈置，莊嚴·肅穆兼而有之。</p>
<p>至聖誕前夜止，他們那裏已收容了九百六十六個難民難童，大多數都是警局保送去的，自投的極少數，計壯健的四百四十九名，兒童四百六十四名，婦女六名，老弱四十七名，都按照他或她的年齡，性別，加以分類。這近千的人數中份子是複雜極了，有公認爲社會敗類的癟三，乞丐，地病，流氓，小偸以至　手，有父母雙亡的孤兒，有忍心被拋棄的私生子，有公務員，有小商人，也有進過高等學府的大學生，怎樣去管理訓導這數以千計的　民，眞是一個嚴重的問題，這一點周所長祖望向記老提出，他說：現在他們以訓導爲中心，另外又設立管理生活·敎育。特別敎育三組，至於日常生活，簡括的說是精神重於一切，完全軍事化，除早晚升降旗二次大集合精神講話外，共他如體格鍛鍊，勞動服役，個別談話，小組討論等，每天不斷地進行着。他們的口號是「敎養兼施，工讀並重」，他們施敎原則，在兒童是讀書重於工作，在壯健是工作重於讀盡，在老弱則以撫養爲唯一的任務。</p>
<p>爲養成難民難童自治精神，什麼都由他們自己管理，所有四十多位職員祗負監督的責任，他們劃分了區·戶·現等許多小單位，另外有依照難民的技能，編成了許多工作隊，如泥水，木作，廚房，縫紉，洗濯等。</p>
<p>難民難童中患有皮膚病花柳病及白面癮的很多，約佔百分之卅以上，現在已由衛生局派有醫師二位護士三位常川駐所負責診療。如果遇到病重的，另送仁濟。時疫或市立醫院診治，故在衛生上已有了保障。</p>
<p>該所額定收容人數是一千二百名至一千五百名，警察局希望他們能容納到一萬名，這在金錢物質二感缺乏的情形下，祗有希望社會熱心慈善事業的大善士多多慷慨解囊。</p>
<p>最後記者附帶報吿的，在昨夜同樂會上社會局福利處長毛子佩和科長黃惕人專員嚴長衍等特地去參加，確是値得敬佩，的確我們不能忽略了這一羣被人們遺忘的難胞。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>風俗</p>
<h3>聖誕節的掌故</h3>
<p>— 張培月</p>
<p>聖誕節的起源</p>
<p>普通大家都以爲十二月二十五日是耶穌的誕日，聖誕節就是慶祝他的生日的。其實耶穌究竟是那一天降生，歷史上並沒有詳實的紀載。當初歐西各國民族，每年冬至原舉行節令慶祝，大約就在十二月廿五開始。後來基督徒拿慶祝耶誕來替代原先的遊樂，該天逐變作耶穌的誕辰，大家都相信耶穌是十二月二十四夜半降生的了。但直到現在，慶祝耶穌誕日時，仍保留着許多古代民族節季的遊樂。</p>
<p>相傳第一次慶祝耶穌誕日，是英王亞塔爾皇帝，在英國約克城，那年是西歷五百二十一年。</p>
<p>聖誕節賀片</p>
<p>「恭祝聖誕」的賀片是英國人發明的。最初大家祗不過口頭上道賀，後來英國人習慣相沿，每到聖誕節淸晨，要到挨家的窗口呌喚這句話。不久大家將賀語寫在信上互相寄贈。直到一八西六年，倫敦有十個藝術家，名呌康約瑟的，才用石印印上賀詞，用彩色繪上圖畫，大小同名片差不多，那是第一張聖一誕節賀片。</p>
<p>聖誕老人</p>
<p>聖誕老人穿着紅衣服，拖着白鬍子，背着大袋的玩具，可以說完全是爲一　孩子們設造出來的。所以各國的聖誕老人都是從保護兒童的神聖化出來的。德國保護兒童的神是Christk,ndleln，聖誕老人就呌做Kriss,Kringle。荷蘭是St.Nichola　s，聖誕老人仍呼爲St.Nichola　s，但傳到美國後，就變作Santaclaus了。他名字雖各地稍微不同，但他的使命是一樣的，就是增加孩子的興緻。所以他總是背着玩具，從爐烟突裏溜下來，把東西塞在牀面前掛的襪十裏面。</p>
<p>講到烟突同襪十的起源，也很有趣，原來英國人老早就有和我們歲底掃塵的風俗相似，在新年前頭，必須是將烟突打掃幹凈讓好運道進來，再一湊活，聖誕老人每次就從烟突中下來了。掛襪十是英美人想出來的，原先荷蘭兒童是把鞋子放在爐邊，據說聖誕老人必須是看到鞋子擺好在那裏，才將玩具塞在裏面，英美人更聰明，用了襪子，襪子可伸開，地方又大些，儘可多放些東西進去。</p>
<p>聖誕樹和冬青</p>
<p>聖誕樹的起源，傳說倒不一致，有人說是路得興起的，說他因爲要使他的孩子看星光下雪樹的景子，遂在園中砍斷株小杉樹，　在房內，上面燃起起蠟燭來。那天晚上正是聖誕節前夕，後人就相製下來。但也有人說是聖文佛利興出來的，他有一次在林中砍一株大橡　，一陣大風過時，樹木多折倒，獨有一株小杉樹元立不動，聖文佛和遂宣稱這是聖樹，聖誕節遂用它來點綴了。還有聖誕節用冬靑，起源也很早，古代羅馬人川桂枝代表和平勝利喜樂，後來基督從沿襲着，用桂枝點綴窗戶，意思耶穌曾進來過。英國人川冬靑替代了桂枝，據說冬靑白色的花象徵聖潔，紅色的實象徵耶穌爲罪人流的血，冬青編的花圈更代表耶穌殉難時頭上　的棘刺王　。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>聖誕節和聖誕老人</h3>
<p>— 樂羣</p>
<p>戰神把聖誕老人吼走了，這樣，他可以自由自在的儘管　進兵力，去滿足他的殺人　。結果，侵略的戰爭開始了，由東亞到西歐，到整個地球。接連不斷的砲火的氣息，充滿了世界。聖誕節那天的聖誕老人敢下來嗎？</p>
<p>但是，終於，侵略者投降了。於是，今年的聖誕節算是要比往年熱閙了，因爲人們都相信「和平」的世界裏，聖誕老人必定能到地上來，賜予人們以幸　。我們也但願這樣，使我們苦了八年的老百姓們寬鬆地伸一下　腰。或者政府定聖誕節爲我們的民族復興節，用意就在此吧！</p>
<p>街上商店的廚窗裏，　　着許多不同的聖誕老人圖像和聖誕樹，聖誕賀年片……，把街面弄得太好看了。正和勝利消息發出後的主席像一樣，眞够前後媲美！學校放假，公司打烊，一片太平的氣象。</p>
<p>到一個外國的朋友家裏去，巧極了，那位朋友的父親母親和妹妹弟弟擠在一塊兒，　置一個一間屋子大小的聖誕老人圖案。看他們的勁兒，眞是够味。據那位朋友吿訴我，他們已花費了　金數百元，還沒有全部成功。感激朋友的母親，說我是外國人，不知道這之間的　故，詳細的指點我說：某處是聖誕老人的進門處，某處是孩子受降福的地方，某處是……使我奇怪的是：聖誕老人不走大門和窗戶，而却從烟肉裏走下來，無怪那位朋友的母親說我不懂掌故了。</p>
<p>今年聖誕節的聖誕老人能下來是可　的了，每個盼望過聖誕節的人們都在這樣想。我呢，也是同樣。</p>
<h3>新聞背景</h3>
<p>— 余範</p>
<p>聯合國善後救濟總署督辦萊孟（Herbert　H.Lehman）向國會提出第二年的十三萬五千萬元預算案。</p>
<p>倫敦有人向一家報館建議發起救濟歐洲難民運動，願將自己極刻薄的配給糧食節省下來，捐充　舉，結果一月中　應者三萬人。</p>
<p>法國有一個美國士兵致函屋條報編者說：「我們實在吃得太豐富太肥美。全歐洲有這許多人，男的女的，老的幼的，都處於飢餓的困境，爲什麼我們一定要被　肥得像猪　？請損有餘以奉不足，我願吃得少一些吧」。</p>
<p>美國與歐洲形成强烈的對比，凍餒飢寒等等字樣，在美國早已淡而忘之。聖誕火雞正一車一車裝運過來；爲避免購肉擁擠，限價提高二分一磅；皮鞋配給制已取消以後可大量生產，自由購買；「耐綸』人造絲襪新貨將於聖誕節應市；勝利公司不碎唱片上市；RCA新式無錢電機。</p>
<p>據估計日本，明年須輸入食物三百四十萬噸，共値三萬萬元，始能免於飢饉。然而日本　己沒有能力，不僅要靠盟國貸這筆巨款，還須仰賴盟國船隻把食物運到日本。</p>
<p>在中國，八年中不斷的戰火蹂躪，不斷的逃亡流浪，『人民需要救濟是如何的迫切，非任何人所敢揣測。』</p>

<p>在聖誕節的前一星期，母親和舅母帶了我們到公司裏去，要我們選擇自己所愛的禮物；我要了一付跳繩的繩子和一匣着色畫紙，這是我所久想要的，雖然那時我還不會着巴；哥哥們每人選了一把劍上有七顆紅星的七星寳劍，和一把汽槍。</p>
<p>聖誕節的前幾天，我還參加了聖誕禮拜，（那是我生平第一次），當唱詩班婉轉的唱着讚美詩，慢慢的步入時，前面的兩個人手中拿着金色的十字架，和一面鮮紅的旗，我還以爲是天使來了，快樂得拍着小手，呌道：「呀！媽，看呀！小天便，小天使！』媽趕快阻止了我。聖誕夜的前一天，客廳裏裝置好了聖誕樹，樹上掛滿了金，銀，色的聖誕鐘和小星星，又裝着無數的燈泡，藍的，紅的，……五顏之色的。樹頂上聳着一顆大星，一面銀色，一面金色，這也是我們久盼的東西。在聖誕夜，我們吃好夜飯，就坐在客廳中等，一會兒，電燈媳滅了，我們同聲地呌道：「呀！這一聲呌喊，又是驚又是喜；驚的是電燈熄了，可是同時聖誕樹上的燈却亮了，於是這呌聲又變爲喜了。啊！多美呀！那五色的燈光，映着那金銀色的鐘和星，發出燦爛的光輝閃爍着，直逼我們的眼睛，幾乎睜不開來。那時的快樂是莫可言喩的。我們環着樹跳躍着，笑着，直到疲乏了才止。</p>
<p>這是兒時的第一個聖誕節，現在，和平來臨，光明重至人間，今年的聖誕節是和平後的第一個聖誕節，所以又想回復從前一樣，盡興的慶祝一下。</p>

<h3>羅美爾和傷兵</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>在北非戰役中，要以杜白魯克爭奪戰爲最激烈，該城曾由英德兩軍數出數進，幾番易手，演成慘烈的拉鋸戰。以下的故事就發生在杜白魯克，是該城中英國傷兵醫院的院長某大尉講的。</p>
<p>第一次羅美爾的軍隊突入杜白魯克，該醫院仍沈靜的照常工作着，抬來的傷兵，不論是英國兵或是德國兵，都一樣去醫治。</p>
<p>醫院中突的靜悄下來，羅美爾親自來了。他站着，望望一排排的病床。他走到一個德國傷兵身邊，簡單的問了一句，他靜靜的聽那傷兵講給他聽，他沿着一條病床走過去，時刻停下來問其他的德國傷兵。</p>
<p>最後，羅美爾向英國的大尉打了個招呼。他說，「我們的兵士吿訴我，說他們完全和英國兵士一樣受你們醫治照料。你們缺少藥品，但你們一樣分給他們用。我就派人送藥給你們。你們照這樣工作下去，沒有誰來騷擾你們的。」他說完，大踏步走出去。</p>
<p>藥很快的送來，醫院利用這些藥，救活了許多英國兵和德國兵。醫院進行工作時，果然不曾受到任何干涉，不曾遇到一點騷擾。</p>
<p>停了幾天，戰局突然轉變，羅美爾的軍隊棄城退走，但撤退時，該醫院一些不曾遭到損害。戰局轉移，勝負互迭，但該醫院祇管照常的工作着。</p>

<h3>林肯擦皮鞋</h3>
<p>— 孫喜麟</p>
<p>某一個淸晨，地點是在白宮。</p>
<p>秘書爲了「要公』，去訪大總統。由傳達者領導到一個廣大的客廳，走到應下，傍邊有一個男子不停地在格支格支擦皮鞋，秘書毫不留意地正想走過，不覺吃了一驚站住了。</p>
<p>原來大總統正在擦他自己的皮鞋。</p>
<p>「您是大總統，做這樣的事，被人看見，頗不雅觀，尤其是被責族婦人……」秘書往常聽人在背後說大總統時常露出鄉下人的粗野態度，記在心裏，今朝忍不住這樣說了。</p>
<p>林肯却滿臉微笑，對着秘書露出驚異的眼光：</p>
<p>『呀，擦皮鞋是可恥的事嗎？大總統與擦皮鞋的；同是爲世人而勞動的公僕。世間應無地位卑賤的職業，惟有心地卑劣的人。」</p>
<p>希望今日的達官顯宦們，能都一聆林肯總統的名言：『大總統與擦皮鞋的，同是爲世人而勞動的公僕！』</p>

<h3>杜魯門老太太</h3>
<p>— 沈翊鵾</p>
<p>杜魯門總統的母親，瑪莎杜魯門夫人，上個月　九十三歲，但仍很矯健；她不斷地閱讀美國國會紀錄，爲的是要知道那些議員們說點甚麼。她說：「我要活到一百歲。」</p>
<p>「哈里（杜魯門總統的名字）送國會紀錄給我，」她說時帶着得意的神情。</p>
<p>她的書一向是自己讀的，而且「不戴眼鏡」。直到去年，因爲跌傷，眼睛受了影響。才由杜魯門的妹妹瑪麗小姐讀給她聽。</p>
<p>杜魯門老太太和杜魯門小姐住在美岡詹克森郡的格蘭烏鎭，距坎薩斯城不遠，全鎭共有八百人口。他們住的是一座現代的黃色平屋，有五間房，和大街隔開一絛路。離開鎭外半哩就是古老的杜魯門田荘，杜魯門夫人曾在那裏消磨掉她大部的歲月。</p>
<p>杜魯門夫人於一八五二年十一月二十五日生於一個田荘內，就是今日坎薩斯城的東南住宅區。</p>
<p>一八八一年，她和的翰·杜魯門結婚，兩年以後，搬到離格蘭烏鎭一百哩的拉麻爾。一八八四年五月八日，杜魯門總統在這裹降生。</p>

<h3>救濟資平售　辦法應予改善　務使平民沾惠</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>美國援華救濟物資，上月起已有大批陸續運裝來滬，其中包括麥。麵粉。藥品·舊衣。罐頭。水果。建築。材料。麻袋·卡車等十餘種，截止目前爲止，本市除已有大量麵粉由救濟總署上海分署分贈各慈善團體及猶太僑民外，並將麵粉及罐顯食品兩種送入市塲普遍平售。根據中國救濟總署署長蔣廷黻氏上次在平談話此項救濟物資，並非完全免費救濟人民，係採平糶方法出售，以工代賑，售價則較市價減低百分之五云云，因是此次本市的麵粉價格每包亦須一千九百元之數，我們對於救濟物資採用平糶方法，自無異議，不過此項物資之運華，原在救濟國內戰後一般爲物價所迫無以爲生的貧苦大衆，尤其如麵粉之類，向爲平民日常食糧，中等人家以上，已很少食用，那就覺得所定價格，亦和其他物資同樣僅較市價減低百分之五，未免太苛，與「救濟」兩字的意義，也似不大相稱，不但平民沾惠很少，且大多仍有無力購買之苦，又如最近許多以採用麵粉爲主的大餅及吃食攤，亦並未因麵粉充斥於市而見跌價，便是一個鐵證。至於日前平售的罐頭水果及杏乾，其每聽價格竟有高至二千五百元者，則連中等階級亦難以享受，結果自不免爲一般富有者購去，廣吿上還登着很注目的「慈善救濟平賣」，更覺背題太遠了。</p>

<h3>Marshall Discusses His Mission to China: Will First Seek Opinions from All Sides; Chairman and Madame Chiang to Host Luncheon Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 24th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, General of the Army George C. Marshall, hosted dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists at the U.S. Embassy on Shefu Road at 10:00 this morning. Mr. Marshall had a youthful face and white hair, and his expression remained as solemn and calm as when he disembarked from the plane the day before. Mr. Marshall, wearing a khaki Army jacket with five-star insignia on his shoulders, stood calmly by the fireplace in the corner of the room and said briefly: "I am very pleased to meet with you reporters today. However, I have not been in China for long, so I do not have much to tell you. Moreover, my primary purpose here is to gather information and listen to the opinions of all sides, some of which are not as announced externally. The U.S. policy toward China has been explained in detail by President Truman's statement, so there is no need to elaborate now. My understanding of China is limited, only gained a little bit in Washington and China in the past few weeks. What I am more familiar with is the eight years of arduous fighting by the Chinese people, and the great historical weight of the U.S. Army and Air Force personnel fighting alongside the Chinese army in China. I have never flown over the Hump. In the past, I only resided in Tianjin, Beiping, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan for three years. As for Central China, South China, and Chongqing, I have never been to them before. I have been very interested in China even before today, and the American people are even more concerned about China after it was forced to rise up and resist the war. Today, after the victory of the war, the American people's concern for the Chinese people and world peace has increased even more." Mr. Marshall paused slightly and said to the reporters, "Now, if you have any questions, you can ask them, but I am afraid that there are some questions that I cannot answer." The reporters then asked questions, which Mr. Marshall answered separately. Regarding how long Mr. Marshall would stay in China, he replied that it was undecided. When asked if he would go to Yan'an, he replied that he had not considered it yet. When asked when the U.S. troops would withdraw, Mr. Marshall smiled and said, "I don't know either, but all American officers and soldiers wish to return home as soon as possible."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Special Envoy Marshall held his first public meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters in the accompanying capital on the morning of the 24th in his office. Around 9:30 AM, more than fifty reporters had gathered in the front corridor of the U.S. Embassy building, which was probably an unprecedented grand occasion for press conferences in the past. At 9:50 AM, General Marshall, accompanied by Mr. Robinson, Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy, ​​arrived at the embassy. In the misty rain, General Marshall stood on the lawn and leisurely gazed at the rainy scenery of the mountain city for three minutes, looking quite content. When General Marshall entered the hall, he frequently nodded to the reporters standing in formation and said good morning. The reception was then held in the special envoy's office. After Mr. Robinson, the Chargé d'Affaires, made a brief introduction, General Marshall made a statement, saying that there was nothing he could report at the moment, and that he would make another statement in a few days. The United States is concerned about China and its relationship with the world in the future, and believes that China will contribute to maintaining world peace. The press conference ended in less than twenty minutes. When General Marshall spoke, he stood throughout, and his tone was calm and steady, with the clear and bright tone typical of people from the eastern United States. After the reception, General Marshall shook hands with the reporters one by one and took photos as a souvenir.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 24th] U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall received Premier of the Executive Yuan T.V. Soong at his residence on the morning of the 24th. He then hosted reporters at the U.S. Embassy. It is said that the U.S. government and he personally are extremely concerned about the political consultation conference that China is about to hold.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Chairman Chiang and his wife will host a luncheon for U.S. Special Envoy to China, General of the Army Marshall, at the Lin Garden official residence at noon on the 25th. They will also invite Brigadier General Randel, Director of the U.S. Military Liaison Office in Chongqing, Mr. Robinson, Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy, ​​Counselor Smythe, Navy Attaché Captain Kenney, Colonel Byrd, aide to the special envoy, Secretary Shepherd, and our government officials Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Bai Chongxi, Wu Dingchang, Shang Zhen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Xu Yongchang, Wu Guozhen, Yu Hongjun, Chiang Tingfu, Jiang Menglin, etc. to accompany them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] Mr. Robertson, Chargé d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy, ​​will hold a Christmas party on the 25th to entertain Special Envoy Marshall, and will introduce the embassy staff to General Marshall. The invited guests include U.S. Embassy staff, including staff from the Army and Navy Attaché Office, the U.S. Information Service, and the Temporary Research and Intelligence Office, officers from the Chongqing Army Liaison Group, and U.S. press reporters stationed in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Shenyang and Harbin to be Officially Taken Over Before New Year's Day; General Du Yuming to Inspect Beizhen County</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Central government representatives held a handover ceremony in Changchun, and the Soviet side also sent representatives to participate. This is the first event since the Northeast fell into enemy hands that the Chinese government has recovered its former territory from the Soviet army. Changchun has had heavy snow for several days and has become a silver world. Residents have hung up the national flags of China and the Soviet Union to celebrate, and the situation is very enthusiastic. Since Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Economic Commission, arrived here, he has been in contact with the Soviet authorities and relevant parties for several days. The Changchun Railway has been quite busy with passenger transport recently, and air transport for supplies is also ready. The local people are eagerly hoping that the army will arrive soon so that the current chaotic situation can end as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 24th] In view of the fact that the entry of the National Army into the Northeast has generally been stepped up, the central government's official takeover of Shenyang and Harbin from the Soviet side seems to be realized before New Year's Day. Local Chinese newspapers believe that the acceleration of this work is due to the "more friendly attitude of the Soviet side." After the National Government took over Changchun over the weekend, the Chinese mayors of Harbin and Shenyang, who attended the Changchun takeover ceremony, reportedly left Changchun by plane yesterday to take up their posts, and many experts accompanied them, including officials in charge of the Central Bank. It is expected that other experts from the National Government will also fly from Peiping. "The Republican Daily" reported that the follow-up troops of the National Army, which were carried by American transport ships and landed on Huludao, have arrived in Jin County and are now crossing the city and advancing towards Shenyang. According to other newspaper reports, General Du Yuming's troops are also spreading out in a fan shape towards Yingkou, threatening this port currently occupied by the communist army. The situation of the National Army in the Northeast is improving day by day, but the activities of the communist army in the front and rear continue to increase.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] The troops advancing towards Shenyang to take over defense reached Beizhen on the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, General Du Yuming personally went to Beizhen County to inspect. It is expected that he can reach Heishan and Qianhoudahushan on the evening of the 24th. According to reliable information, the communist army in Yixian is showing signs of wavering.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Delegation Will Visit Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 24th] It is heard that a Soviet military delegation will visit Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief He Encourages Party and Government Personnel</h3>
<p>Hoping that all Troops Will Rectify Discipline</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Commander-in-Chief He reported on the key points instructed by Chairman Chiang at the memorial week of the Army Headquarters on the morning of the 24th, which included four items: (1) The central and local takeover personnel have not been able to fully utilize the enemy and puppet materials and factories that have been taken over, and they should find ways to utilize them in the future. (2) The places where various agencies and troops in Nanjing are stationed are still not clean and tidy enough. Each sick soldier in the hospital only has two military blankets, which is still not enough and should be improved as soon as possible. (3) The damaged parts of Nanjing City have not been completely repaired. The suburban highways should be repaired and restored as soon as possible. Japanese prisoners of war should be used to undertake this work as soon as possible. (4) The Army Headquarters has not made full use of its authority to guide and supervise the party and government agencies to promote all matters to perfection. Before the official return to the capital, the Army Headquarters should be responsible for exercising its authority to supervise and guide the party and government affairs in the areas recovered by the headquarters, so that all restoration work can be promoted smoothly. Mr. He hoped that the responsible comrades of the party and government would work harder so as not to disappoint Chairman Chiang's high hopes. He also hoped that any shortcomings would be reported at any time, and encouraged all military agencies and troops to rectify discipline.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Board of Changchun Railway Held its First Meeting Yesterday; Mo Dehui Inspects Changchun Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] The Chinese and Soviet supervisors of the Changchun Railway Supervisory Board have now arrived in Changchun one after another, and it is scheduled to hold its first supervisory meeting at 11:00 AM on the 24th to discuss the regulations of the board and all matters to be carried out.

Mayor Zhao Junmai led all his subordinates to warmly welcome him. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mr. Mo, accompanied by Huang Yanping, visited the Continental Academy of Sciences.

In addition, there are nearly 10,000 communist troops gathered in the Xiaozuo Village, Paixianzhuang, Huren Village, Zaolin, and Heishui Pong areas northwest of the Jingxing Coal Mine, and the number is unknown.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Express Opinions on the Current Situation: Believe that the Way to Solve the Current National Affairs is to Return the Military to the Country and Return Political Power to the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The National Assembly representatives issued a common opinion on the current situation on the National Revival Day, which roughly stated: We believe that the way to solve the current national affairs is no more than two points, namely, returning the military to the country and returning political power to the people. The army is a tool for defending the country and protecting the people. No party or faction shall take it as its private property. It must be returned to the country. The reason is very clear and there is no need to elaborate. Political power is entrusted to the people of the whole country. It should end the period of political tutelage and return it to the people. Today, the National Government exercises political power. In theory, it is based on the legacy of the national father Sun Yat-sen, and in law, it is based on the "Law on the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China" promulgated in the 20th year. The former stipulates that the highest principle of our revolution and nation-building is to achieve constitutional government through political tutelage, and the latter is granted by the National Assembly to return political power to the people. It should be the sole object of the National Assembly convened in accordance with the law, and a democratically elected government should be formally organized by the National Assembly to exercise the power to govern. Apart from this, the National Government has no right to privately transfer power. Chairman Chiang solemnly declared at the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association on March 1 this year: "We can only return political power to the National Assembly of the representatives of the people of the whole country, and cannot return political power to the party meetings or their coalition government of various parties and factions." The words are simple and profound, and are indeed irrefutable truths.</p>
<p>The political consultation conference that is about to be held has no legal basis. It is just a negotiation to resolve party disputes, so that the opinions of various parties on national affairs tend to be consistent. However, major national plans cannot be decided without a genuine public opinion body stipulated by law. The representatives of this National Assembly were legally elected and produced by the people. They cannot be loved or hated by various parties, nor can they be changed by the political consultation conference. If the beliefs in this fundamental great principle are not firm, and the measures are uncertain, then the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace and unification cannot be achieved, and it will give opportunists an opportunity to take advantage of, and the gains will be endless.</p>
<p>This National Assembly is the foundation for our country to implement constitutional government, and convening it on time is a clear path to solve national affairs. Democracy and political system, the rule of law comes first. If any party does not adhere to the usual practice of constitutional government in modern countries, and puts the interests of the party above the interests of the people, and does not hesitate to destroy the law and disrupt discipline and shake the foundation of the country, then disasters will follow each other, which will not only affect the international status, but also threaten world peace.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Materials in Peiping and Tianjin are Distributed to the People as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The principle for handling enemy and puppet materials in Peiping and Tianjin has been determined. All daily necessities will be distributed to the people as much as possible to stabilize prices. The funds obtained will be used to enrich local construction. The Parallel Camp has sent Senator Dong Shaoliang to Tianjin to organize the Tianjin Branch of the Enemy and Puppet Materials Committee to preside over the matter.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Our Medicinal Materials Has Arrived in Singapore</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 24th] Our country's medicinal materials industry has been transported here from Hong Kong by British ships. The total amount is 5,000 tons, and what has been transported this time is the first batch of medicines. This batch of goods clearly shows the Chinese business community's ability to seize opportunities. The local authority here has provided special convenience for unloading. It is said that other goods will continue to be transported to Singapore, with many difficulties. There will be no lights, no meat, and no beer to drink this Christmas. Most of the streets here are lit by gas lamps. However, due to the strike of gas workers, there is darkness and no lights. After the slaughterhouse workers went on strike, there was no meat to eat. The brewery workers also went on strike, so there was no beer to drink.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Strongly Speaks of Sino-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater, spent the eve of Christmas with Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin in Nanjing today, and gave a speech at Mr. He's dinner party. In addition to thanking Commander-in-Chief He for the grand holiday feast on behalf of his subordinates who are far away from their homeland, he said that he was deeply gratified that we could spend the first Christmas in peace after winning the victory in hard fighting. However, both our China and the United States bear a major responsibility for the future world peace. Only by striving to maintain permanent peace can we live up to the heroic warriors who have already sacrificed their lives.

<h3>Exchange Rate of Northeast Currency to Legal Tender to be Posted Daily; Puppet Manchurian Currency and Soviet Military Currency to be Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 24th] According to sources, in the future, the Northeast currency and the legal tender will not have a fixed exchange rate, but will be posted daily by the Central Bank. Holders of legal tender who want to exchange it for Northeast currency must apply to the Central Bank, just like buying foreign exchange. This measure is to avoid the large-scale transfer of funds to the Northeast, which will affect the local financial prices. The former puppet Manchurian Central Bank banknotes and Soviet military coupons will also be collected and cleared at a considerable time. The status of legal tender in the Northeast currently varies from place to place. The Xingying in Changchun absolutely prohibits the use of legal tender, while in Jinzhou, a large amount of legal tender is pouring into circulation. It is heard that the ratio of legal tender to Manchurian currency in the area is 3:1. Regarding the issuance of currency in the Northeast, it is reported that the former amount issued by the puppet Manchurian Central Bank was 800,000,000,000 yuan. After the Japanese surrender, the puppet Manchurian government increased the issuance by 400,000,000,000 yuan to pay for the officials' severance fees. The first batch of Soviet military coupons was 100,000,000,000 yuan, and it is not known whether it will be increased in the future. As for the issuance of Northeast currency by the National Government, the current amount is very small. 50,000,000 yuan was transported on the 13th of this month, and another 50,000,000 yuan was transported on the 21st, totaling 100,000,000 yuan. This phenomenon of divergence can be eliminated after the opening of the Jinzhou Central Bank. The amount of salaries for administrative personnel in the Northeast has a great impact on the social economy. After several discussions by the Standing Committee, it is heard that it has been determined that the monthly salary for senior officials is 9,000 yuan. If there is no major fluctuation in prices in the Northeast, this amount is sufficient for honest officials to maintain their integrity. Prices in the Northeast are very low. If financial management is handled properly in the future, society will be easily stabilized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 24th] The Central Bank transported Northeast currency to Jinzhou. 28 boxes were transported on the 23rd and 14 boxes were transported on the 24th. Once preparations are completed, business can begin.</p>
<h3>A Full Tour from Beiping to Jinzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 22nd] The Beining Railway is open to Jinzhou, which has not only provided the northern people with psychological security but also enabled a smooth flow of goods and restored freedom of commerce. The day after the railway to Jinzhou reopened, a reporter took a train from Beiping to Jinzhou for a full line inspection. The train journey took three days, with heating inside the carriages and the route closely protected by Sino-American troops. Over 4,000 passengers arrived safely at their destinations with great pleasure. The fact that 1,192 "Hua Li" (Chinese miles) of railway transportation inside and outside the pass could be quickly restored in such difficult circumstances is a truly successful demonstration in the aftermath of victory. This could not have been achieved without the great cooperation between the Allied forces, the National Army, and the farmers. If there were no Communist disturbances and the trains could run day and night, the travel time could be reduced by half. When the train departed from Beiping Station, tickets to Jinzhou were in great demand, with as many as 15 passenger carriages. The trains from Beiping to Tianjin traveled quickly and arrived on time. The 134 kilometers from Tianjin to Tangshan took a relatively long five hours due to the initial repairs of the route. Railway facilities on both sides of the track were damaged by the Communists, and the conditions in the villages were particularly unbearable to witness. The train arrived in Tangshan at 5:00 PM. Passengers stayed overnight in Tangshan and changed trains to continue their journey. Tangshan was teeming with passengers and cargo, showing great prosperity. At that time, the Kailuan Mining Company was moving back to Tianjin, and the celebrations at the station were very enthusiastic. Kailuan never stopped production from beginning to end. All the bridges were guarded by the US Marine Corps, with 50,000 workers working under their protection. The US troops set up tents and guarded the bridgeheads at minus seven degrees Celsius, enduring great hardships. Every passenger was deeply moved, so whenever the train crossed the railway bridge, passengers would reach out the windows and shout "Ding Hao (very good)!" The American soldiers would smile and respond with "Ding Hao." In the vast fields near Beidaihe, two American soldiers were repairing a telephone on the spot. A Chinese child was riding on one of their shoulders, watching them repair the telephone. It was truly a beautiful picture viewed from the train window, and one was deeply moved. It is said that 9,500 tons of coal can be produced every day. Tangshan has a population of 200,000, and order is maintained jointly by the National Army and Allied forces, so the local situation is very stable. There are occasional bandit disturbances within 40 "Li" (Chinese miles) near Tangshan, but they are not a cause for concern. In the morning, the train traveled east from Tangshan, passing through Guye, Changli, Su County, Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao to Shanhaiguan. Along the way, over seventy American soldiers were seen, and two children were sitting on the shoulders of one of them, watching the repairs to the telephone. Looking out the train window, it was truly a beautiful picture, and one was deeply moved. At 7:00 PM, the train arrived in Shanhaiguan and stayed overnight in the town of Shanhaiguan. The surrounding area was a scene of ruins. The crimes of the Communists were clear for all to see. The 70,000 people were struggling to survive. Survivors of the disaster recounted the Communist conscription and looting, with tears streaming down their faces. They were especially grateful for the National Army's rescue and for their compassion in bypassing the Communist forces and not firing a single shot at the pass, leaving them in tears of gratitude. On the morning of the 20th, the train crossed the pass. It took eight hours to travel 182 kilometers. The forests and plains on both sides were fertile and lovely. Herds of cattle and sheep could be seen everywhere. The double-track railway built by the Japanese had been partially destroyed, and thousands of workers were rushing to repair it. There were still some Communist soldiers hiding in the small villages along the way, but their numbers were very small. The train passed through several small stations, and farmers were seen angrily burning Communist border region currency. It was reported that farmers in the countryside had suffered greatly from this currency. This section of the route was closely protected by brave soldiers who had fought north and south, demonstrating their loyalty to the country and the people in the severe cold of minus fourteen degrees Celsius. The passengers on the train deeply respected them. After the reporter crossed the pass, they constantly heard the common people hoping that Chairman Chiang would visit the Northeast. The people of the country earnestly hoped for good governance, and the enthusiasm for seeing the leader's grace was evident everywhere. The train arrived in Jinzhou City in the fading light of dusk and saw a large number of troops setting off to the front lines. The fatigue of the three-day journey was forgotten due to this exciting scene.</p>

<h3>The United Nations Preparatory Committee Concludes; The General Assembly is Scheduled to Convene Next Month; Representative Gu Weijun Delivers the Closing Remarks on Behalf of the Entire Body</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Yesterday at 5:00 PM (1:00 AM Shanghai time), the preliminary work of the first plenary session of the United Nations organization was completed. The 51 representatives of the Preparatory Committee had been meeting since yesterday morning and passed the last items on the agenda of its final meeting in the afternoon. [Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The representatives of various countries on the United Nations Preparatory Committee elected Gu Weijun as the speaker for the final meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, representing the entire body to deliver the closing remarks to show great respect to our country, which was the first to be invaded in World War II. Gu Weijun immediately first represented the Chinese delegation in praising the achievements of the committee's work as expressed by the chairman of the Preparatory Committee, as well as the spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm among the representatives of various countries in promoting the rapid and optimistic results of the work. Then, on behalf of all the delegations, he expressed his gratitude to the chairman, secretary, and all the staff of the Preparatory Committee for their leadership and assistance. He also expressed his deep gratitude to the British government for its hospitality and the facilities provided, which enabled the meeting to achieve great success. Gu continued, "We firmly believe that when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in January next year, the work we have already completed will greatly facilitate the future General Assembly in establishing various major institutions. In this important era, the signs of peace have already been seen. The work of the Preparatory Committee has been completed, and on January 13th next year, we can see the establishment of a new world organization, on which the hopes of all mankind truly rely."</p>
<p>The Four-Stage Construction Work is Finally Completed [Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingxun, London, 23rd] The completion of various tasks by the United Nations Preparatory Committee today shows that the construction of the United Nations organization has already entered the final stage. The construction of the United Nations organization is divided into four stages: First, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, where the four powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union reached a general agreement on the preliminary system of this world organization, and it was confirmed at the Yalta Conference in February of this year. The second stage was completed by the San Francisco Conference held on May 27th of this year. At that time, the United Nations Charter was formulated, and the Preparatory Committee was established. The third stage began seven weeks later, on August 16th of this year, when the Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee held a meeting. The Executive Committee was composed of 14 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Iran, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. After nine weeks of detailed discussion, the Executive Committee passed a massive report, which contained detailed rules for the preparation of the organizational structure of various important institutions of the United Nations organization. This report became the basis for discussion by the Preparatory Committee. The Preparatory Committee began work on November 24th of this year and concluded this afternoon. After more than four weeks of review, the eight technical subcommittees of the Preparatory Committee thoroughly considered the points in the Executive Committee's report, some of which were revised, some were not revised, and some were completely rejected, but most were adopted. Only 15 countries participated in the Executive Committee, while 51 countries attended the Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of the resolutions made by the Preparatory Committee was the unanimous agreement, that is, the issues that caused fierce debate, such as the preparation of the Secretariat, the organization of the trusteeship system, and the selection of a permanent address, were all satisfactorily resolved. This is why most of the representatives who participated in the plenary session of the Preparatory Committee believed that the rapid completion of the work was a good omen. When the Yalta Conference was held, no one predicted that this world organization could work effectively within a year. During the San Francisco Conference, some people did not believe that these 51 independent countries could agree on the details of the organization before the end of this year. According to the general report made by the final report of the eight technical subcommittees of the Preparatory Committee, it will be submitted to the General Assembly on January 20th next year for final review, which will include the temporary rules and procedures of the United National General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, and the organization of various important institutions of the United Nations. In addition, it also includes various suggestions made by the organization of the Secretariat and the issue of the privileges of the United Nations organization, as well as the draft agreement on the "special status of the permanent address" of the United Nations to be established in the United States between the United Nations and the US government. The preface to the final report of the Preparatory Committee expresses infinite hope, saying that if the spirit of the Preparatory Committee's completion of work can be a general guide, then the United Nations organization can be established smoothly. If the United Nations organization can grasp the will of all corners of the world in its initial measures, then people who place great hopes on it will not be disappointed, believing that this organization is the last chance to free themselves and their descendants from the shackles of war.</p>
<h3>The Last Two Subcommittee Reports Passed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The plenary session of the Preparatory Committee passed the final reports submitted by the Type A Technical Subcommittee (responsible for matters related to the Trusteeship Council) and the Type D Technical Subcommittee (responsible for matters related to the United National General Assembly) this morning. When the representative of Norway, the chairman of the Type A Technical Subcommittee, presented the report, he said that the framework of the United Nations has now been completed, and the General Assembly can be held on January 10th next year to discuss important work, without being repeatedly blocked by procedural debates. When the representative of Czechoslovakia proposed to pass the report of the Type A Technical Subcommittee, he praised the attitude of cooperation and mutual assistance of the five powers, which finally made the work of the Type A Technical Subcommittee a great success. The representatives took a positive and concrete attitude towards various resolutions related to all countries, large and small. The several important debates that the Executive Committee went through from August to October have now all been passed by the entire body, or at least by a two-thirds majority vote, which is indeed a sign of the smooth progress of the United National General Assembly. The final report of the Type D Technical Subcommittee was also passed this morning, but the representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and South Africa still declared that they reserved the right to discuss again in the General Assembly the rights and freedoms of the residents of the trust territories proposed in this report.</p>
<h3>The Anglo-Siamese Treaty Can Be Signed Within Days</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The Anglo-Siamese Treaty can be signed within one or two days. Its nature is between a peace treaty and an armistice agreement. As for the final peace treaty, it will have to wait until after the Siamese elections are held before it can be signed. London officials said that this transitional treaty is an "agreement in principle" and will be accompanied by an appendix, stipulating its scope and purpose. The final terms of the treaty have been agreed upon by the British and Siamese representatives, and they have all received instructions from their respective countries to prepare for signing. It is also known that the Siamese government has agreed in principle to export rice to Burma and Malaya, but the quantity is not specified in the treaty. It will also not be possible to decide before the signing, as the current state of supply requires examination by British and Siamese experts. The US State Department's decision to withdraw its request to oppose the signing has pleased London. Observers in London believe that the US's doubts were caused by "outdated information" received.</p>
<h3>Korean Travelers Talk About the Conditions in the Soviet-Occupied Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] Travelers arriving today from the Soviet-occupied zone said that Korean communists and anti-communists clashed in recent anti-communist riots, during which eight students were killed. According to these travelers, 30 to 50 Japanese women and children die every day in Hamhung (transliteration), in the Soviet-occupied area of northeastern Korea. The Soviets have almost concentrated all Japanese men in a certain area of Hamhung and transported them to Siberia for forced labor in coal mines and other mining areas. In the Soviet-occupied zone, the treatment of Japanese people is not good. In the eastern part of northern Korea, there are not enough coffins to bury the dead, and rice straw bags are used instead. These refugees bring various stories about the Soviets disregarding the welfare of the people, but since the Soviets have refused to allow American journalists to enter their occupied zone, it is impossible to verify the truth.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Technology Secrets Were Seized by the US Occupation Forces in Large Numbers; The Search for Intelligence Was Almost Exhaustive</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd, United Press] According to a US military intelligence report: Among the many military and technical secrets seized by the US military in Japan, one was an aircraft-loaded torpedo that could destroy submarines. This torpedo could hover underwater and destroy the target. The Japanese stopped continuing research a year ago because they lacked a satisfactory gyroscope controller. Lieutenant General Willoughby, Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of intelligence work under MacArthur, said, "When our work in Japan is completed, the US government will have obtained far more information about Japan than any country has obtained about another country." Among the 1,500 documents in the US military archives that expose various Japanese secrets is the process of interviewing former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. He told Allied interviewers at the time that he knew that Japan's war with the United States was almost hopeless. Most Japanese leaders knew that Japan had been defeated when Saipan fell. Konoe stated that his sole purpose in China was to make Chinese leaders recognize their destiny as a great oriental nation. He had no intention of depriving China of its political and economic freedom during the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Lieutenant General Willoughby, Deputy Chief of Staff of MacArthur, said that when our mission here is completed, the US government will be able to obtain a large amount of information about Japan. No country's information about another country can match this amount. The files and reports collected and stored reach more than 1,500 pieces. Other information is also being collected. Hundreds of pieces of information are collected every week. Various investigation teams are currently conducting investigations throughout Japan. Relevant data are recorded in detail, and several special investigation organizations continue to conduct investigation work. Their efforts will undoubtedly find out Japan's wartime secrets, and some of the mysteries of Japan will be revealed one by one. The scope of the investigation conducted by the US investigators is wide-ranging and all-encompassing. Just listing a few examples can illustrate the variety of investigation objects, from residential trees, food, eating habits to political conditions, all are included. Even highly technical radar jet propulsion machines are also within the scope of investigation.</p>
<p>Radar Equipment Incinerated</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Special Dispatch] Radar equipment worth 500 million yuan, used to defend the B-29 Superfortress bombing of the city of Yawata, has been destroyed by the occupation forces.

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] Kyodo News Agency reported that crime is increasing in Tokyo. On Saturday and Sunday, the police rounded up and arrested thieves, detaining 900 men and 100 women. Most of them were charged with minor crimes, but there were several armed robbers among them.</p>
<h3>The New National Government of Iran Begins to Perform its Duties; The Kouji People in the North Assist the Iranian Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] According to a TASS report from Tehran on the 16th, the National Government of Iranian Azerbaijan has begun to perform its duties. All government agencies in Azerbaijan have been taken over by the new government. Some officials who are not sympathetic to the new government have gone to Tehran. The situation in the area controlled by the new government is peaceful, and the local people support the new government.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tehran, 24th) Iranian defense forces in several cities in the Iranian province of Azerbaijan are still resisting the attacks of the democratic forces, while the Kouji people, who have always opposed the Iranian military authorities, have now changed their past attitude and are assisting the Iranian regular army in resisting the Assyrians, Caucasians, and democratic forces.</p>
<h3>General Patton's Funeral Held in Heidelberg</h3>
<p>[United Press, Heidelberg, 23rd] The remains of the famous American general Patton were buried in the 16th-century Christian Church here today. The ceremony was simple and moving, lasting only twelve minutes. All of the highest-ranking American officers in Europe participated in the funeral procession, but the only relatives present were Mrs. Patton and her brother, Earl. Many soldiers at the scene were moved by the solemn ceremony, as were the German civilians. During the funeral procession, no fewer than 6,000 people stood along the road from the church to the station. Patton's remains were placed in a steel coffin, covered with the national flag, and led by a military band and sixteen armored vehicles, which will be transported by special train to Luxembourg, where they will be buried on Sunday. Mrs. Patton wore a black leather coat and a black hat, and rode in a car with her brother to escort the funeral. More than a dozen senior generals escorted the funeral procession, and the new US Commander-in-Chief in Europe, General McNarny, also participated in the procession by car, moving as slowly as a frog.</p>
<p>[United Press, Luxembourg, 23rd] Soviet Deputy Commander-in-Chief Marshal Zhukov arrived here today to attend General Patton's funeral.</p>

<h3>Various Countries Enthusiastically Celebrate Christmas. White House Square Relit. Loud Carols Evoke Memories.</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 24th] This is the first Christmas after victory, and the British people's celebration is more enthusiastic than ever before. Loud and cheerful carols evoke many happy memories, and the six years of suffering are finally in the past.</p>
<p>[American News Agency, Washington, 24th] The torch that was extinguished in 1941 was relit today in White House Square. President Truman personally lit the Christmas tree and made a Christmas broadcast to the war-torn countries of the world (the original speech appeared in yesterday's newspaper). At the same time, veterans across the country are also trying to return to their hometowns for the holiday. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is planning to aid Belarus, Austria, Korea, and Taiwan today as a Christmas gift to the world. The Red Cross clubs in all war zones where U.S. troops are stationed will be fully open during the Christmas holiday to welcome the troops. Soldiers on their way home will also receive about 1.25 million boxes of Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>MacArthur's Message</p>
<p>Hoping for Mutual Love Among Mankind</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] MacArthur issued a Christmas message today, saying: "On this Christmas Day, the first Christmas in five years without the sound of gunfire, I and all the personnel of the headquarters thank God for saving us from death and destruction. We pray that the merciful Lord will support us so that we can dedicate ourselves to completing the ideal that Christ wants to realize in this world, that is, peace on earth and goodwill among all mankind."</p>
<p>Holy Land Holds</p>
<p>All-Day Prayer and Blessing</p>
<p>[United Press, Bethlehem, 23rd] Bethlehem, a small town in the mountains of Judea, is the birthplace of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago. Tomorrow, countless believers will come to worship again. The Church of St. Catherine here will hold all-day prayer, meditation, and procession blessings. The ceremony is solemn, as it is every year, but this year there will be thousands of people in khaki uniforms participating.</p>
<p>The Rich Celebrate</p>
<p>The Common People Are Inferior</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The world is at peace, and although the British people have goodwill towards people from all countries, their first Christmas after the war, in terms of family gatherings and children's festivals, does not seem to be able to return to pre-war standards. Some families have already reserved seats in mid-November and will be provided by hotels and restaurants in the West End of London. Music and dancing will be enjoyed all night long. However, most ordinary people have only gathered their families for the first time in seven years. Their family conditions are inevitably somewhat difficult, and some cannot prepare firewood and coal for Christmas Eve according to traditional customs. There are also quite a few relatives still overseas, serving in the war and unable to return. The food situation for children is slightly better than before. It is reported that 300,000 turkeys from South Ireland and more than 3.5 million pounds of grapes from Haifa, Palestine, have arrived in Britain. Australia has also agreed to greatly increase the supply of eggs and will transport more tea, wheat, fresh meat, salted meat, ham, butter, coconut oil, sugar, wine, and sweet wine. Besides food, the second most important thing for Christmas is gifts.</p>
<p>Gifts and Toys</p>
<p>Inferior Goods Supplied to the Market</p>
<p>However, this year's gifts are scarcer than the six Christmases during the war. Some stores rely heavily on old goods, eager to sell them on the one hand and eager to buy them on the other. The most popular gifts in the past, such as handbags, handkerchiefs, cosmetic cases, and coat hooks, are not easy to buy. Even gloves and handkerchiefs require sacrificing precious ration coupons. Pont Street, the fashion center, has been damaged by bombs, and although it can still supply some specialty items, their value is very high. A piece of old jewelry can cost as much as thousands of pounds. A department store has a special counter selling old prints, old maps, old nautical charts, and copperplate prints, with prices starting from one pound. Genuine and fake jewelry varies in price and size, with the lowest being only seven shillings and six pence. Playing cards are very difficult to buy, and children's toys are also very scarce, expensive, and of poor quality. Wooden trains are crudely made and poorly painted and are now displayed in the windows of major department stores. In the past, such inferior goods would never have been displayed on the shelves. Some toys are simply a few rough pieces of wood loosely nailed together.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union in the Far East Seeks to Develop Fisheries. Vladivostok Shipyard Rushes to Build New Ships. Experts and Workers Move from West to East.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] The Soviet Union, after its lightning seven-day offensive against Japan, occupied southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands and is working hard to rebuild. The fishing industry has been restored and expanded, factories are being built in succession, and port facilities are also increasing. Soviet experts and workers from western Soviet Union are moving to the new region in large numbers. It is predicted that the Soviet Far East fishing harvest will double next year. When Soviet troops occupied the area, they discovered that natural resources had been exploited recklessly, regardless of future losses, resulting in a significant loss of the richness of the fisheries in the central and southern Kuril Islands. The largest and most complete equipment on the northern Kuril Islands was heavily damaged by American bombing. In southern Sakhalin, the Japanese army adopted a scorched earth policy when they withdrew, leaving only rubble. It is reported that many of the large Japanese fishing boats in the northern Kuril Islands and Kamchatka have been taken away by the Japanese during their withdrawal. However, the Soviets are now doing their best to restore them. A vanguard of several hundred Soviet technicians and fishermen from the Caspian and Black Sea regions has arrived in the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. The industries built by the Soviets in the Far East related to fisheries are now being expanded to meet this new demand. Shipyards in Vladivostok and other places are rushing to build new ships for fishing.</p>
<h3>The Indian League Convened an Emergency Meeting Yesterday. Pointing Out That Britain's Traditional Policy Has Not Changed. Wavell Will Meet with Twenty Leaders Again Next Month.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Bhandari, the Central Indian Commissioner of the Indian League, stated at an emergency meeting convened by the League yesterday that there can be no peace in Asia until foreign forces are completely expelled from Asia. Menon, the secretary of the League, said that the convening of this meeting is to express our loyalty to the Congress Party and to support the complete independence of India. The World War has not brought peace to India and Asia. If foreign forces are not completely expelled from Asia, peace will never be realized. The so-called socialist government of Britain has not broken away from the style of the Churchill-Amery era, and the recent statements of the Labor government have made the situation in India worse. Menon also said that Britain has no right to arrest personnel of the Indian National Army, and we firmly oppose the British authorities in India.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 24th] The Governor-General of India, Lord Wavell, may meet with Gandhi again in Calcutta before mid-January.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Criticize Konoe's Memoirs</h3>
<p>A Leader of War Cannot Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Who Can Believe What He Described?</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 23rd] California newspapers commented on Konoe Fumimaro's suicide and the statements in his posthumously published memoirs, with much criticism. The Sacramento Bee editorial of the McClatchy chain said that Konoe made a final protest before taking poison, arguing that he had tried to seek peace during his three years as prime minister. From a historical perspective, his words are difficult to establish. It will take more than months or years to understand the chaotic situation in Japan before the Japanese-American War. However, it is clear that the definite steps towards war were taken when Konoe was the prime minister. Although Konoe had already resigned on December 7, 1941, the bombs had already been made, and someone only needed to light the fuse. The Sino-Japanese War occurred during Konoe's tenure, and the United States' protests were directly rejected by Konoe. All efforts by third parties to mediate the Sino-Japanese War were also thwarted by Konoe. The Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was also signed during Konoe's term as prime minister. On October 5, 1940, Konoe even boldly predicted, "If the United States does not understand the true meaning of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and actively cooperates to create a new world order, it will lead to war with the United States." These are not the words of a peace lover. Examining Japanese history from 1930 to 1940 inevitably gives one the impression that Japan's military aggression visibly slowed down when Konoe was not the prime minister. Therefore, Konoe's suicide does not seem to be due to the extreme mental anguish of being accused of being a war criminal. It is more likely that he knew that once he was interrogated and history was published, even if he was not recognized as the culprit of the war, he would be judged as one of the masterminds of Japan's war crimes. The San Francisco Chronicle commented that Konoe's posthumous work said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka knew about Germany's plan to invade the Soviet Union when he signed the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which is not true. Hitler's news of the invasion of the Soviet Union made Matsuoka realize that he had been fooled, and Konoe was not unaware of this. Therefore, he resigned after changing the number of days. Konoe should be responsible for the Tripartite Pact signed on September 27, 1940. As for who should be responsible for his handshake with Stalin on April 13, 1941, and Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22 of the same year, the Japanese people will know. It is unbelievable to say that Matsuoka knew Hitler's intentions and deliberately fell into the trap. Furthermore, Germany may not have been willing to inform Matsuoka of its plans. Germany's contempt for its Eastern allies was obvious to all. According to the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, he repeatedly ordered Matsuoka to refute the accusations that Germany deliberately deceived Japan. Although Matsuoka did not publicly do so, he may have convinced Konoe that what he did was intended to protect Japan's position.</p>

<h3>The Most Memorable Day Today!</h3>
<p>Today, December 25th, is the festive Christmas. Beyond the festivities, the general public in China also recognizes two great meanings.</p>
<p>The Republic of China was born in an era of turmoil. Shortly after the announcement of the democratic system, the ambitious Yuan Shikai wanted to uproot this young sapling of democracy, newly planted in a thorny garden. He wanted to plant imperial thorns in its foundation, hoping that it would quickly spread throughout the garden. However, with a thunderous roar, General Cai E raised the banner of righteousness in Yunnan, receiving unanimous response from people across the country who favored democracy. Yuan Shikai, who was lying on the dragon bed in the Xinhua Palace, dreaming of the Hongxian dynasty, finally woke up from his beautiful dream and ascended to heaven. This premature imperial restoration movement disappeared with his imperial soul. Therefore, we can say that December 25th symbolizes the spirit of struggle for a democratic China.</p>
<p>After that, the Anhui clique, the Zhili clique, the Fengtian clique, and other major warlords fought for supremacy in the Central Plains. Small warlords in Sichuan and Fujian competed for fiefdoms, and the situation of large and small warlords' civil wars plunged the people into misery. The great Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at that time, as the principal of the Whampoa Military Academy, punished the wicked and comforted the people. He led a benevolent army and wiped out the evil and dark forces, which aroused the jealousy of Japan, who had been eyeing the country. They abandoned the gradual economic aggression and adopted a military annexation approach, resulting in the turmoil in Wanbaoshan and the attack on Beida Camp. In one night, the vast territory of Northeast China changed color. Chairman Chiang deeply knew that our country's preparations were not sufficient at that time, and the time was not ripe, so he had to endure humiliation and work hard in silence. At that time, the general public with shallow knowledge not only failed to understand Chairman Chiang's painstaking efforts and long-term planning, but also made groundless accusations and rash actions, which ultimately led to the reckless and impulsive Xi'an Incident.</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident was a major turning point in the rise and fall of the nation. Chairman Chiang, empty-handed, negotiated with the rebellious troops amidst drawn swords and bared bows. His life was in danger, and the captain of the guards, Chiang Hsiao-hsien, died in the line of duty, and the chief of staff, Qian Dajun, was injured. The urgency of the situation caused panic throughout the country. With Chairman Chiang's deep wisdom and strong courage, he finally safely escaped danger on this memorable day. Chairman Chiang's great character of benevolence and courage, after being tested by this incident, shone even brighter, winning the unanimous respect and support of the people throughout the country. From the initial outbreak of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident to the Japanese army's surrender in Zhijiang, throughout the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people were able to maintain national unity and remain steadfast. The inspirational power of Chairman Chiang's handling of the Xi'an Incident was truly a major driving force. On the ninth anniversary of Chairman Chiang's escape from danger in Xi'an, let us pay the highest respect to this uniquely great leader! (Zhang Deqian)</p>
<h3>A Great Place That Is Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer. Hainan Island's Scenery Is Still the Same. The Sea, Land, and Air Transportation Network Is Actively Being Developed.</h3>
<p>This is the scenery of Hainan Island five months after the Japanese surrendered.</p>
<p>From the airport to Haikou—the capital of Hainan Island—you will see a strange sight: vehicles outside the city drive on the left, while inside the city, the new regulation of "driving on the right" has already been implemented. This is the so-called gradual change. The roads on Hainan Island are very well-maintained. This is probably because there are no heavy vehicles driving on them. The enemy, Japan, deliberately managed it in the past few years, vainly trying to build Hainan Island into the strongest naval base in the Far East. Therefore, their first step was to reorganize the island's transportation lines. This isolated island, with a circumference of 250 miles, is interwoven with modern cement highways, allowing heavy military vehicles to transport military supplies back and forth.</p>
<p>Four Major Airports Occupy Key Military Points</p>
<p>The long and slender railway network connects the various key points on the island. On this circular island, two major lines intersect vertically. There are also four major airports on the island, occupying key military points, with perfect equipment.</p>
<p>Now that things have changed, most of the railway vehicles have been damaged in this war, the coal has been used up, and the station parking lots are full of ruins and rubble. The locomotives are also rusted and lifeless, standing still. The railway width also seems to be unsuitable for modern needs.</p>
<p>The gasoline shortage has paralyzed most of the highway transportation.</p>
<p>Hainan Island's prosperity has always relied on imported and exported goods. However, there is no news of imported ships now, because they are afraid of touching the sea mines. The lack of ships is, of course, also an important reason. Shipwrecks dot the ports everywhere, and there is no way to salvage or repair them at present.</p>
<p>Sea Transportation: A Blessing in the Eyes of the Qiongzhou Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>To revitalize the victorious Hainan Island, the most important thing is, of course, the revival of commerce. At the same time, to restore commerce, it is necessary to restore transportation first, so that Hainan Island can contact the outside world. Currently, Hainan Island is in a state of semi-isolation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about sea transportation: before the war, Haikou's foreign sea transportation was very developed. At that time, there were regular navigation lines that regularly sailed to the ports along the coast of mainland South China, as well as Tokyo, Vietnam, Singapore, Siam, the Philippines, and other places, which was very convenient for passengers. When the Japanese invaded Haikou, it was suspended. Now, Qiongzhou has been liberated, and everything presents a new phenomenon. The righteous people living in Guangzhou Bay are also buying boats and returning home one after another. The shipping between Haikou and Guangzhou Bay has resumed. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation, only sailing boats are temporarily running, sailing once every two or three days. As for the speed, if the tide is favorable, it only takes 24 hours to arrive. The round-trip fare is about two or three thousand yuan. It is heard that the navigation to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places is being restored, which is good news for the general public.</p>
<p>Land Transportation: A Total Length of More Than a Thousand Kilometers</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about land transportation. To put it bluntly, our Qiongzhou land transportation is quite developed due to the completion of the highways in various counties, and Haikou has also become the starting point for transportation, with local products and foreign goods gathered here as the center. As for the types of vehicles, there are automobiles, rickshaws, horse-drawn carriages, and ox carts. Statistics show that there are a total of 23 ring-sea and longitudinal routes in Qiongzhou, with a total length of 1,474 kilometers. The convenience of land transportation can be seen. Later, after another renovation, branch lines were added to the villages and towns in various counties, which was even more convenient. What deserves our attention is the 175-kilometer-long railway from Sanya to Beili. However, due to the lack of coal, there are very few trains. Now that the enemy has surrendered, transportation should have been very convenient. However, in the west, bandits often appear, so it is still unsafe. The east is relatively peaceful, and cars are running as usual. However, since there are not many cars running now, the passengers are very crowded. Each car has about 20 people, and people are standing and sitting on the sides and roofs of the cars. The car owners only care about making money and do not care about the safety of the passengers at all. The Qiongzhou authorities have already ordered a crackdown to protect the safety of passengers. As for the fare, it has risen from 700 yuan to 5,000 yuan from Haikou to Jiaji, which makes the general public feel that they "cannot return home even if they have a home."</p>
<p>Utilizing the Airport, Aviation Business Will Flourish</p>
<p>Speaking of aviation, there used to be Eurasia Civil Aviation, flying from Guangzhou to Haikou via Maoming. After the Japanese invaded, they expanded the original airport in Haikou several times. Airports were also added in Wenchang, Lingao, Jiaji, Changjiang, and Sanya, among which the Haikou Airport is the largest and Sanya is the second largest. The equipment is also quite complete. There are currently no civil airlines flying. We predict that once the above-mentioned airports are utilized, the aviation business will develop smoothly.</p>
<p>The sea, land, and air transportation of Qiongzhou are roughly as described above. Although it is not convenient now, it is undoubtedly bound to become more prosperous and convenient in the future due to the increase in land lines and airports.</p>
<p>The main export goods are fruits, peanut oil, sugar, and coffee. The main import goods are rice and manufactured products. Very little rice is produced on the island and has always relied on French Indochina. Currently, transportation is cut off. In the eyes of outsiders, the islanders seem to be all vendors selling bananas to make a living.</p>
<p>Blue Sea and Yellow Sand: A Tropical Landscape</p>
<p>Haikou City seems to be dormant under the tropical sunlight. The trees are lush, and the palm trees sway in the breeze, fully demonstrating the tropical landscape. The azure sea water washes the yellow sandy shore, surging with white foam.</p>
<p>The island's commercial scope is extremely small, limited only to the island itself. There are very few cars on the road. The standard of living is also very low. But on the surface, the islanders seem to be very satisfied with their lives.</p>
<p>Life on the island is indeed very quiet and peaceful. There are many small coffee shops on the street corners. A cup of milk coffee costs 25 yuan in legal tender. Most of the people who patronize these coffee shops are barefoot women who sit and chat and rest after returning from work. Martial law is temporarily in effect on the island, and no one is allowed to pass after 10 pm every night. The streets are densely packed with armed sentries.</p>
<p>French Colors Dominate the Whole City</p>
<p>The buildings here are deeply dyed with French colors. Most of the new buildings are in the Japanese style. Although many Japanese have been detained in concentration camps in the suburbs, Japanese men and women can still be seen on the streets from time to time. The first to be sent back to their home countries were probably the 15,000 Chinese laborers who were forcibly conscripted by the enemy.</p>
<p>Catholicism has a great advantage on the island. The magnificent and clean Red Cross Hospital and many small schools in the city are all achievements of Catholicism. The Customs Office is the most modern building on the island, and its structure is quite exquisite.</p>
<p>The damage from the air raids is limited to buildings such as ports and airports. In Haikou City, there are no traces of past air raids.</p>
<p>The food problem on the island is not very serious at present. The rice reserves are gradually thinning, costing 25,000 yuan in legal tender per stone. The authorities are now working hard to restore relief efforts. Photos of Chairman Chiang and the Father of the Nation can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>In the past, the fuel on the island, the coal stored after the Japanese army surrendered, has now been used up, and electricity has also run out. Fortunately, the island has abundant forests. The fuel problem should not be a problem. At present, most of the islanders use oil lamps.</p>
<p>A Great Place to Escape the Cold: It Is Expected to Be Realized Soon</p>
<p>The islanders are threatened by snake plagues, but at the same time, snakes are used as a delicacy in the vegetable plate. Other mountain delicacies and seafood are roasted dog meat and jellyfish, which taste like peanut butter.</p>
<p>This is a great place that is warm in winter and cool in summer. In winter, even in the current month of December, the climate is only 75 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes people feel quite mild and comfortable. There is absolutely no so-called cold wave invasion.</p>
<p>In the near future, I think Hainan Island may become the ideal winter resort in our country. (Li Ming)</p>
<h3>American Troops in Tokyo - Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department from the December Issue of Life Magazine</h3>
<p>The diligent Japanese people have already cleared away the rubble and debris in Tokyo, the most devastated area among Japan's bombed cities. Various vehicles have also resumed operating on the streets of the modernized urban center that was partially spared from the bombings. The Japanese Parliament is preparing to convene 21 million women with the right to vote in Tokyo during a special general election meeting; this is the first time they have gained suffrage. Out of the three million soldiers stationed in the mainland, all but a few non-commissioned liaison troops have been demobilized. There are still a total of six million Japanese soldiers abroad. General MacArthur has lent Japan one hundred tank landing ships, allowing for the repatriation of 100,000 Japanese soldiers each month. MacArthur has ordered the abolition of Japan's conscription system. MacArthur also uncovered a large sum of $250 million that the army and navy had secretly embezzled from the government. Japanese tourists had not been able to visit Mount Fuji for five years, but now the American flag is flying on its peak.</p>
<p>Current Status of Shintoism</p>
<p>Many people were spared from wartime sacrifices because they maintained contact with the Japanese mainland; some of them went to the mainland to avoid the heavy bombing. This winter, many people can still barely survive by fleeing to the countryside, where the food supply is much more abundant than in the cities.</p>
<p>Japan has now been defeated and is under the strict rule of an American officer, but the Japanese people remain largely unchanged. MacArthur has abolished Shintoism in Japan, prohibiting it in schools, government offices, and shrines. Only Shintoism related to individuals or families will not be interfered with. The Japanese still bow to their Shinto emperor and shrines. However, a certain Japanese legal expert has made a surprising declaration, saying, "The Japanese people do not believe that they are descendants of the sun goddess in Shintoism."</p>
<p>The Japanese Emperor, who once instigated the Gohan Revolution to resist the military cliques, has not gained any benefits. His private property is estimated to be worth 100 million yuan, and he owns 3.2 million acres of land. Now, his property and the assets of 67 male and female members of the royal family have been frozen. Currently, his annual budget of 400,000 yuan must be carefully reviewed by the Americans. Japan's reparations may reach 330 billion yuan, and he may be personally responsible for paying a portion of the reparations, but Japan's annual revenue is only one percent of this huge sum.</p>
<p>Changes in the Lives of Japanese Police</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the most noticeable and significant change is the reform of the police force. Japanese police have historically ruled the people with terror. When arresting someone, a Japanese police officer only needed to order them how to walk, how to turn, and how to follow them automatically, and the arrested person would usually obey. When Japanese people asked police officers for directions, they always bowed deeply. Even now, they still do. Last week, the head of the American Counterintelligence Corps sharply criticized the Japanese police for using terror tactics and illegal confiscation. In the eyes of Americans, the behavior of the Japanese police demonstrates their rudeness, shamefulness, and immorality.</p>
<p>Women and Chocolate</p>
<p>It is easier for American soldiers to solve their "woman problem" in Tokyo than anywhere else. This problem can often be easily resolved in Hibiya Park, next to the Imperial Palace Gardens. The women who are approached are not the common geishas, nor are they the readily available maids or prostitutes. Instead, they are often housewives who have broken away from family supervision. The routine involves teaching them some basic English and giving them something to eat, like chocolate or fruit. So far, Japanese men have expressed anger about this behavior.</p>
<p>The US government's misguided exchange rate policy for US dollars and Japanese yen has brought American soldiers to the brink of personal bankruptcy. American soldiers' salaries are paid at the fixed rate of 15 yen per dollar (i.e., one yen equals six and a half US cents). However, due to the black market exchange rate, the Japanese currency has inflated from 27 billion to 44 billion yen in four months. One US dollar can be exchanged for 70 yen. An American soldier needs 20 US dollars to spend a night out without alcohol.</p>
<p>The Popularity of New American Dances</p>
<p>People in the military can travel for free and buy souvenirs at department stores run by the US military. Their best asset is cigarettes. If they can get past the military police, each pack of cigarettes can be exchanged for two US dollars. Some brothels in Japan are allowed to remain open. The dancers in Tokyo have learned new American dances (Jitterbug), but they are threatening to strike, saying that a plate of sweet potatoes is not enough compensation for dancing new dances. General Eichelberger has planned a large-scale sports program, including baseball, football, ice skating, and field hockey, to solve the entertainment problems of American soldiers.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Winter in Tokyo</p>
<p>In Tokyo, 250,000 people live in dilapidated shacks, and hundreds of thousands more are homeless, sleeping in parks. This winter, there is also a shortage of rice. The black market price has risen to $4.25 per pound (calculated using the pre-war exchange rate). In 1941, the price of rice was four cents per pound. Japanese officials claim that 8 million people will die from freezing and starvation. The American authorities believe this number is exaggerated, but a high mortality rate is inevitable.</p>
<p>To pay for food imports, Emperor Hirohito plans to sell his pearl treasures worth $4 million. The United States is forcing the Japanese to redistribute arable land, selling one-third of Japan's unclaimed arable land to tenant farmers. Although this method may help with future wealth distribution, there is actually no wealth to be divided this winter. As a result of the air raids, only 25% of Japan's major industries remain, and there are ten million unemployed people!</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, public discontent and lack of rest are difficult to avoid. Among Japan's 36 political parties, the smallest Communist Party is the most organized and disciplined. The Japanese Communist Party has no connection with Moscow and is the only party in Japan that calls for the abolition of the Japanese Emperor. Nevertheless, they still need to liberate themselves from tradition, because one female communist, while expressing her opinion on Japan, still shed tears.</p>

<p>American Women Learning Industrial Design</p>
<p>Before the war, household furniture and equipment in the United States were mostly designed by men. Currently, there are more and more women engaged in this emerging industrial design field.</p>
<p>Pictured: American women practicing in the industrial design department of the Chicago American Academy of Art. The increase in the number of female students trained at the school over the past four years has exceeded 75%. Students in the design department first receive simple art training and gradually learn formal operations. In the picture, a female student is attaching a part of the handle to a chair using an iron punch.</p>
<h3>The New Development of the Northeast: A Base for Asian Industrialization</h3>
<p>The industrial empire built by Japan in Northeast China will be taken over by China. This property should be considered part of the reparations Japan should pay for its occupation of China. At the same time, it is also an opportunity for China to begin its industrialization. Japan has invested hundreds of millions of yuan in Northeast China's industry. At this moment, industries such as steel towns, chemicals, machinery, artificial gasoline, and timber have not suffered severe damage from the war. China will not have to pay any price to Japan for this takeover, because the ownership of the industry mostly belongs to Japanese government-operated companies. The United States is paying close attention to the situation of the transfer of industries in Northeast China. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>After China takes over the industries in Northeast China, the management work done by the Japanese will definitely be transferred to Chinese hands. Therefore, perhaps American managers and engineers will be called upon to help with the operation. At the same time, how to raise funds, whether it is for operation or for China to transfer to any individual or company, is also a problem. Perhaps China will hope for American investment. Furthermore, the market for the products of this new industry is a fundamental issue. Perhaps American economists will be hired to design the best way for Northeast China's industry to generate wealth.</p>
<p>There is a rather complicated factor here. The Soviet Union enjoys half ownership of the South Manchurian Railway (according to the Sino-Soviet treaty, the Changchun Railway is jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union). It may demand a share of ownership of the Northeast China industries owned by the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau operates many industries such as mines, factories, shipping, telephone, and telegraph. The development of Northeast China's industry should be done cautiously.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Shadow of Japan's Democratization</h3>
<p>Since General MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, occupied Japan, only a little over three months have passed. With a calm attitude, he has gradually unfolded measures to deal with post-war Japan. Such as the arrest of war criminals in batches, the dissolution of financial groups, the improvement of individual farmer relations in Japan, and the separation of Shintoism from the national polity, etc., are either directly related to the liquidation of war responsibilities, or lay a good foundation for a new democratic Japan. Within such a short period of time, and with such achievements, we cannot but deeply admire General MacArthur's outstanding talents. Yesterday, news from Tokyo by the Associated Press and the United Press stated that General MacArthur's headquarters declared that the basic work for building a new Japan has been completed, and Japan's ancient feudal system has been eradicated. Whether this report is reliable is questionable. If it is true, it can only be regarded as an unofficial observation from General MacArthur's headquarters at best. In the process of Japan's democratization, the imperial family, which currently represents the highest institution of the Japanese feudal system, still exists. We cannot hastily believe that "Japan's ancient feudal system has been eradicated" just because of the improvement of individual farmer relations in Japan, the dissolution of financial groups, or even the separation of Shintoism from the national polity. Because the Japanese imperial family is the center of the Japanese feudal system; if the emperor has not been removed, how can it be said that the feudal system has been eradicated?</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the survival or abolition of the Japanese imperial family, opinions do not seem to be consistent at present. Observers qualified to comment on Japanese issues, either advocate abolition or advocate preservation, naturally each has their own reasons. Generally speaking, conservative people in the United Kingdom mostly believe that the Japanese imperial family is the center of reverence for the people. In fact, it is only a puppet and does not directly participate in politics, and should be retained so that a democratic system can be gradually established with the imperial family as the center. This is originally the view of British "realists." They believe that once the Japanese imperial family is abolished, the entire country may fall into a state of anarchy. This kind of argument seems to be quite powerful in the United States as well. However, in both the United Kingdom and the United States, there is also a group of people who advocate that the Japanese imperial family should be abolished immediately, and there is no room for an emperor in the new democratic Japan. The general intention of China is that the Japanese imperial family should be abolished; although the Chinese government has not issued an official statement on the issue of the survival or abolition of the Japanese imperial family to this day.</p>
<p>At present, the handling of the Japanese imperial family issue is stagnant at such a stage. The Potsdam Proclamation did not explicitly mention the Japanese imperial family issue; Japan proposed conditions when accepting the Potsdam Proclamation, requesting the preservation of the imperial family; but President Truman's reply did not accept Japan's conditions, only stating that the Japanese imperial family must be subject to the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. The major Allied powers only have passive consensus on the issue of handling the Japanese imperial family and have not yet reached active coordination. This matter really should not be delayed any longer!</p>
<p>We believe that in the process of Japan's democratization, the imperial system must be eliminated and not allowed to exist again. Although it is reported from Tokyo that senior officials of General MacArthur's headquarters hinted that if the Japanese Emperor can have unique insights, find ways to solve the rice shortage and unemployment problems, and follow the democratic system implemented by General MacArthur in Japan, so that the Japanese people can obtain a reasonable and perfect government, then the Japanese Emperor and his system can be maintained permanently, and Emperor Hirohito himself hopes that the matter of abdication will be decided by the Japanese people, but the survival or abolition of the Japanese imperial family is now not just a Japanese internal affair that can be decided by the Japanese people themselves, but an international issue that should be decided by the United Nations. We should not forget! It must be known that both Tojo and Konoe organized governments after receiving the Emperor's "great mandate." Legally speaking, the Japanese Emperor is the biggest war criminal in this war of aggression. Whether it is in terms of invading China or in terms of invading the United Kingdom and the United States, he should bear full responsibility for launching World War II. Now that the war is over, we should first eliminate this evil system that not only harms the Japanese people but also destroys world peace. The Japanese imperial family and the British royal family are originally two fundamentally different systems. The formation of the British government is determined by public opinion, and the king does not bear the actual responsibility of organizing the government. However, Tojo and Konoe of Japan came out to organize the government not because of the support of the parliament, but because they received the "great mandate." Moreover, the army and navy directly listened to the orders of the Japanese Emperor, and the cabinet had no right to intervene in them. Therefore, the Japanese Emperor is directly responsible for politics. We cannot treat the Japanese Emperor and the British King as the same. The Japanese imperial family is the supreme commander of this war. Regardless of the current intentions of the Chinese government, the Chinese people have the right to point out that the Japanese imperial family is the head of the Japanese war criminals, and demand that the imperial system should be abolished in the construction of a new post-war Japan.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the United Nations, after mobilizing the strength of the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to defeat the enemy, if the imperial system is allowed to continue to exist, it will only plant the seeds of future trouble. The Japanese people's psychology has always retained extremely deep Shinto superstitions, believing that they are God's chosen people and that they have the sacred mission of ruling the world. It was for this mission that they launched the "Greater East Asia War." Although their self-proclaimed "Greater East Asia War" has been defeated, if the imperial system is allowed to exist, it may give the Japanese people the illusion that their "sacred mission" has only suffered a temporary setback and still needs to be completed in the future. Concentrating the strength of the four countries of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and still not being able to eradicate the imperial system, will make the Japanese people even more believe that their imperial family is "mandated by heaven," increase their arrogance, and once again become a scourge of the world. General MacArthur's separation of Shintoism from the national polity in Japan was originally an extremely wise measure, but if the "god" in the Shinto religion is still allowed to exist, and allowed to be the ruler of Japan in politics, then the future Japan will probably still not be a democratic Japan, but still a Japan ruled by a "god," a Japan of the Emperor of "Hakkō ichiu." This is really a hidden worry for world peace!</p>
<p>For the sake of lasting world peace and for the sake of the interests of the Japanese people, the existence of the imperial system is ultimately a shadow on Japan's democratization. We should clear this shadow, and then the world and Japan can obtain light.</p>

<h3>Buyers Come One After Another: The Gold Market Rises Again, US Dollars Also Rise Gradually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sentiment continued to be good, and the US dollar rose gradually under the large-scale purchases of manufacturers and importers, stimulating the gold market. Many people in the stock market sold their stocks to buy gold, gradually forcing a short squeeze situation. After an initial price of 768,000 in the morning, buyers came one after another. With demand exceeding supply, the price had broken through the 800,000 mark by noon, and finally hovered around 810,000, an increase of 52,000 compared to last Saturday. General public opinion believes that the exchange rate should not be too high (below the market price). General sentiment has also changed its old view, resulting in even more demand for gold and US dollars. The prospect is likely to be good. Gold jewelry is priced at 86,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars are still hovering around 450 yuan. Although demand for dark exchange is high, supply is also pouring in, still standing between eight and one angle.</p>
<p>The US dollar's firm market in Peiping, coupled with rumors that many free merchant ships will arrive this morning, with yarn mills and importers rushing to buy, has resulted in a visible depletion of chips. After opening at a low price of 1280 yuan in the morning, the market improved. After breaking through the 1300 yuan mark, the situation became more firm, and factory demand poured in even more. People in the industry were forced to sell at high prices, so they made up for it in the afternoon. The market became even more profitable. Finally, there was still a lot of demand at a price of 1380 yuan, an increase of more than 120 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong tickets also stabilized accordingly. As a result, old goods were good for five yuan, and new goods rose by three yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Have Reduced Sharpness, Public Bonds Are Gradually Trending Downstream, and the Foreign Stock Rally Has Not Ended</h3>
<p>Public bonds are lacking in pulling power due to the industry's interest turning to stocks. Category C bonds broke into the 700 yuan range as soon as they were listed, and then fell to below 650 yuan. Retail investors still tried to show off, and although there was a pull-up in the middle, they failed to re-emerge from the 700 yuan mark. At noon, they were still selling off due to floating more, falling to around 640 yuan. As a result, they continued to fall by 55 yuan to 90 yuan compared to last Saturday, and the miscellaneous brands approached their difference, and the market situation was very dull.</p>
<p>Initially, Chinese stocks felt somewhat disappointed because the securities association meeting the previous day was not smooth. Many large investors sold their stocks for gold, forming a state of oversupply. Cotton mills retreated from 740 yuan to 690 yuan, and Mayar retreated from 570 yuan to within 480 yuan. After entering, the rise in the gold market stimulated something. Large investors in the securities industry still came to absorb them. Finally, the rebound was seen outside the 500 yuan and 700 yuan mark, and the situation was still firm, but the chips were not very tight (observe that the price ratio of cotton mills to gold on the 15th of this month was more than 1,500 shares, and this morning it only needs a little more than 1,000 shares). As a result, compared with last Saturday, the giant stock cotton mills rose slightly and Mayar fell slightly. Small stocks, New Light, Ping Jingfu, and Quanxing each rose by one and a half yuan. The unpopular old stocks are still being snapped up by strong factions, soaring.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks are still stable, with demand and supply matching. The whole city is just hovering. Customers and securities dealers still have a stomach for bottom-fishing. As a result, Jardine Matheson rose by another 100 yuan, and Jardine Brewery and Paper each rose by 30 yuan. The rest of the unpopular stocks were slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Yarn and Thread Rise with the Price of Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was still stable. Because the price of gold frequently reported high, all kinds of yarn and thread rose by 10,000 yuan. Although the Sichuan gang had a strong appetite for old heavyweight goods such as 20-count special double horses and golden chickens, and rose to 650,000, there were people selling other 20-count yarns, and there were not many transactions. The same industry's buying and selling of 16-count yarn was still not lonely, and people did not see very much glory, and the foot seemed to be unstable.</p>
<h3>White Coal Lumps Rise Again, Prices for Firewood and Charcoal Vary</h3>
<p>White coal briquettes are very popular and have rebounded. White coal dross and coal briquette factories will receive flat-price distribution, and their popularity has become sluggish, and prices have slightly weakened. Bituminous coal dross transactions are idle, and market conditions are flat and soft. Fewer firewood boats are arriving than before, and prices are slightly firm and stable. Cargoes of charcoal are still pouring in, and the market seems to be slightly lower.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Allied Wheel loaded 700 tons of coal from Tianjin. In addition, the Zhongshan, managed by the American President Shipping Company, loaded 9,000 tons from Qinhuangdao and arrived in Shanghai at about 3:00 pm yesterday, mooring at the Puxi Lanyancong Wharf.</p>
<h3>Rice Falls, Oil Rises</h3>
<p>Soybeans, Raw Peanuts, and Bean Cakes are All Popular</p>
<p>Rice market digestion is bleak, japonica and indica average fatigue of 200-300 yuan, White Yuan from Danyang cargo shipment arrived in Shanghai 300-500 packs, Hexia wheel arrived in Shanghai also 200-300 packs, Qingdao Gang suspended, market shape returned to Xiaoliu 600-700 yuan, flour from Beiyang is selling very well, up another 200 yuan, the situation is rising, the oil market is still very beautiful with Ning Gang Zhoushan continuing to enter, up another hundreds to thousands of yuan, this street is still cleared due to flat oil, The soybean price is still rising with Fujian and Zhejiang continuing to enter, up another 300-400 yuan, and the later situation is still firm. Raw peanuts are being sold a lot on this street in winter, and the supply is less than the demand, up another 1,000-2,000 yuan, bean cakes from Taiwan are being processed and connected, Shantou is acting very briskly, up another 200 yuan, and the wine market is also good, up 500 yuan, and the trend is turning from fatigue.</p>
<h3>Allied Ship Loaded with Large Quantities of Northern Goods, Seafood Rises and Falls Mutually</h3>
<p>The Allied ship that sailed to Tianjin to load goods has arrived, loaded with more than 400 pieces of flue-cured tobacco, walnuts, red dates, and more than 2,000 pieces of sundries.</p>
<p>Shima large slices of raw sun-dried longan, yesterday I heard that Jian Banghao had more than ten boxes shipped, this is the first time to offer new here.</p>
<p>Because of the small output of Xuzhou daylily, the market seems to rise slightly, while sales in Fujian and Guangdong are still good.</p>
<p>The arrival of Ming Wang Ginseng is rare, and the previous market reported a rise in pepper, but now the market is leveling off due to a lack of sales. The sales of fennel are gradually slowing down, and the market has reported a decline. Winter mushrooms are being purchased by Hong Kong gangs, and then it is the season (New Year's dishes), so the price has risen, and the arrival of bamboo shoots is still numerous, and sales are waiting to be developed.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Factories Are Expected to Recover</h3>
<p>Small and medium-sized dyeing and weaving factories were severely restricted by the enemy's pseudo-controlled electricity before the victory of the War of Resistance. After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated the electricity for production, it was not restricted in order to encourage production. Therefore, they have been connected to electricity and started work one after another, and the Longhai Line, Sichuan, and Yangtze gangs have started, and the dyeing of various factories has become extraordinarily busy. From this speculation, the recovery of the dyeing and weaving industry is expected.</p>
<h3>Four Banks and Two Bureaus Are Open as Usual Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Today is the National Renaissance Festival and the Yunnan Uprising Anniversary. Member banks of the Municipal Banking Association are closed for one day as usual. However, the four Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks and the China Trust and Postal Remittance Bureaus in this city received orders from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in the Beijing-Shanghai region, and are still open for business as usual according to the Chongqing example. There is no change in commercial banks. In addition, Chen Hang, the Financial Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the Beijing-Shanghai region, has returned to Shanghai after visiting Chairman Chiang in Beijing and reporting on his work.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Book Capital, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Is Still Discussing</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The issue of converting the book capital amount of counterfeit currency in industry and commerce has been discussed separately by the Accountants Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various experts. There is no specific method yet. The Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has set up a subcommittee to study the matter. The Qian family took the method of collecting counterfeit coupons at the rate of 200 to 1, which is not suitable for the conversion of book capital, and there is no other comparable standard that can be promoted. A few days ago, they sent letters to various industry trade associations to solicit opinions so that they could be summarized, and then standards were determined to make recommendations to the competent authorities. In recent days, various industry trade associations have submitted this letter of opinion to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce one after another. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is still discussing this issue seriously. According to the responsible persons of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry and Cotton Cloth Industry Trade Association, the three methods assumed by the former Accountants Association are still worthy of approval. However, if the government also has to strictly levy income tax and profit tax on the false surplus obtained after the conversion of the book capital amount, it is equivalent to a virtual account and actual levy, and the industry and commerce of this city will not be able to tolerate it. Therefore, it is advocated to suggest to the government that the tax collection should be handled in a flexible manner to avoid operators being overly concerned when calculating the book capital amount.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Regarding business and industrial registration, the registration fee should be directly submitted to the Municipal Treasury. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to reduce the back-and-forth travel for applicants, has consulted with the Finance Bureau to request the Treasury to send personnel to the Bureau to collect the fees. The Finance Bureau has agreed to do so.</p>
<p>The local carpentry and plumbing trade unions, facing difficult living conditions, plan to further increase wages. For carpentry, each worker would receive 1,150 yuan per day, and for plumbing, 1,100 yuan, both without meals. The implementation is scheduled to begin on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>The "Yongsheng" steamer arrived in port this afternoon, carrying 11,200 bags of flour as relief supplies, along with commercial goods including over 1,100 cases of preserved eggs, several hundred bags of red dates, and a large quantity of Chinese medicinal materials.</p>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee has approved the allocation of a portion of coal dust to various mechanized briquette factories at a fixed price. Distribution is expected to begin within a few days.</p>
<p>Due to eager demand from foreign merchants and rising gold prices, the market prices of knitted goods all increased yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Inventory: Change in Sales Method; Distribution to End Before January 15</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The local sugar industry, after the victory, still has an inventory of six to seven thousand bags of sugar, entirely owned by Chinese merchants and not enemy or puppet assets. They voluntarily petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to sell it to the public at a fixed price to meet market demand. The Bureau approved the price and public sale method, allowing them to proceed. The highest price was set at 400 yuan, with subsequent reductions. This occurred before February when the market was extremely short of supply, and prices soared to 600-700 yuan, with no goods available. After the news was released, the general public eagerly anticipated it. However, the sugar was stored in the Zhongfu Warehouse, which was sealed due to its involvement with salt, leading to repeated requests and delays for over a month. By that time, new sugar shipments had arrived, and prices began to fall. The Enemy Property Administration Bureau then distributed sugar under its control to the association for public retail, further weakening market prices. Recently, the stored sugar has been unsealed, and the association, through members like Zheng Yizhou, has again petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to change the method to supply users directly. The general plan is as follows: (1) The 2,700 dan of sugar originally intended for sale to consumers will be sold proportionally to previously registered users based on their last allocation. (2) The 1,200 dan of sugar originally intended for sale to government agencies, hospitals, and pharmacies will be included in the above plan if those entities do not need it. (3) The selling price will be determined by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau's first-phase fixed price sale, based on the types and proportions. (4) The 2,300 dan of brown sugar will be returned to the various businesses for self-sale. All of the above methods have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The association will notify hospitals, pharmacies, and retailers regarding their sugar allocations. Agencies and organizations with allocations of 1,200 dan must pay and purchase the sugar from the association before January 15. Any remaining sugar after that date will be sold by the association through other channels.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>Resumption of Colleges and Universities: Utilize Summer and Winter Breaks; Relocation Only After Major Preparations Are Completed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chongqing] The Ministry of Education has recently finalized the methods for the resumption of colleges and universities. The key points are as follows:</p>
<p>Methods for Resuming Colleges and Universities</p>
<p>(1) Colleges and universities that relocated inland and should return to their original locations should immediately select qualified personnel, who, after approval by the Ministry of Education, will carry official documents to receive the school properties in the original location and plan for their renovation in preparation for the school's relocation. (2) The personnel sent by the colleges and universities to receive the properties should work closely with the special envoys of the Ministry of Education. (3) Colleges and universities that relocated inland and the original colleges and universities in those locations that should relocate to other locations should send personnel to the relocation sites to find suitable housing and submit it to the Ministry for approval, allocation, reception, and renovation. (4) National colleges and universities that should relocate should prepare detailed plans and budgets and submit them to the Ministry for approval. (5) The relocation of colleges and universities should only proceed after major preparations are completed. Thorough preparations should be made for transportation, security, medical care, sanitation, food, and accommodation, and the relocation should be carried out in an orderly manner. (6) Colleges and universities should utilize the summer and winter breaks for relocation.</p>
<p>University Winter Break Issues</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to the Ministry of Education: (1) Whether universities in the rear areas will have a winter break this year will be decided by each school. The Ministry, in principle, supports schools not having a winter break so that they can resume operations earlier next year and not delay students' studies. (2) In addition to Vice Minister Hang leading a portion of the staff back to Nanjing to work, the remaining staff in Chongqing will return to Nanjing only after the resumption work of the various schools is completed. (3) The Ministry of Education is consulting with the Ministry of Transportation and the Relief Administration regarding the transportation issue for the resumption of schools in the rear areas, and some of the transportation may utilize highway transport.</p>
<h3>Beijing Celebrates National Revival Day</h3>

<p>Shanghai to Establish Publications Exchange Office; Former Chongqing Branch to be Renamed "Capital Library"</p>
<p>[Liuhua News Agency, Nanjing] A portion of the staff of the National Central Library who are returning to the capital have arrived in Nanjing and have begun working at the former site of the Academia Sinica on Beijige. The library's newspaper and magazine reading room will be officially opened in January of next year. Furthermore, to facilitate the exchange of official reports and books between the government and other foreign governments, the library has established a Publications Exchange Office in Shanghai. Currently, five countries are participating in the exchange. It is also reported that the library's former Chongqing branch will be renamed the Capital Library.</p>
<h3>Phased Relocation Decided by Lottery; Jiaotong University to Relocate to Shanghai Next Year</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] Senior students from Jiaotong University who are going to Shanghai for internships have already departed on the Jiang Jianhong and the military vessel Faku and have arrived in Shanghai one after another. Students remaining in Chongqing are also selling their clothing and stationery in preparation for returning home as the time for leaving Sichuan approaches. The Ministry of Education, in order to take into account the students' studies during the resumption period and the overall plan of the Ministry, has successively sent personnel to discuss the resumption plan with the university's president and students in a systematic manner. The resulting four points are: (1) The university will submit a detailed resumption plan to the Ministry. (2) At the end of this semester, registration procedures for the next semester will be carried out, and classes will continue in Chongqing without a winter break. (3) The relocation date will follow the methods issued by the Ministry, with the principle being to return to Xujiahui, Shanghai, by April 8 of next year to celebrate the university's 50th anniversary. (4) Teachers and students will still relocate in phases, with the order determined by a lottery by student representatives, including those in finance, transportation, shipbuilding, navigation, civil engineering, marine engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial management, aviation, and electrical engineering. Graduate students will travel with the electrical engineering department.</p>
<h3>National Schools to Issue Rice Subsidy Instead of Rice</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing] The fixed-price rice for faculty, staff, and students of national schools will be abolished. A rice subsidy will be issued instead. How the rice price will be converted is currently being discussed, and the market price may be used as the standard.</p>
<h3>Briefs</h3>
<p>Over two hundred faculty, staff, and family members of Nanjing Temporary University recently arrived in Nanjing from Chongqing on the "Yugong" vessel towing a wooden boat. As for those traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing on the "Minquan" vessel, it ran aground on the Yangtze River near Nantong due to wind. A vessel has been dispatched for rescue and should arrive in Nanjing soon.</p>
<p>The city's primary and secondary schools recently drafted three measures and sent them to landlords of various schools: (1) Houses rented as school buildings must not be taken back without reason. (2) Rent increases for school buildings must not exceed 40 times the pre-war amount. (3) Rent increases for school buildings must commence on February 1, 1946.</p>
<h3>Christmas Charity Soccer Match: Donghua's New Lineup to Face British Navy</h3>
<p>2:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park; Mayor Qian to Kick Off</p>
<p>The charity soccer match organized by the Shanghai Sports Association to raise funds for the Relief Association for Comrades Who Sacrificed in the War of Resistance will feature the local Chinese soccer powerhouse Donghua team against the British Navy cruiser Black Prince team. The match will be held at 2:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park on Changping Road. Tickets are priced at 400 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and honorary tickets at 10,000 yuan. This match is expected to be the most exciting soccer game after the victory and will cause a sensation among fans throughout the city. The referee will be Wu Shouheng, and the linesmen will be Huang Renyi and Li Guoyi.</p>
<p>Donghua's lineup has been strengthened by the addition of the former Lianyi trio of Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, and Liu Xianhan, making it the most complete lineup. However, due to Qian Shangyi's injury, Jia Youliang will move to the right wing position, and Chen Mingzhe will play right wing, which may slightly reduce the offensive power. The Black Prince team is considered one of the best in the British Navy in Shanghai, so Donghua is bound to have a tough battle.</p>
<p>To make the match more grand, Mayor Qian has been invited to perform the kickoff ceremony, and a charity ball will be auctioned off on the spot to increase revenue. Donghua's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Li Ning Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Song Lingsheng Fu Zhen Zhang Linggen</p>
<p>Li Yao Sun Jinshun Dai Linjing Jia Youliang Chen Mingzhe</p>
<p>[Reserves] Zheng Yingquan, Lin Wenhu, Liu Xianhan.</p>
<h3>Celebrate Revival Day: Bicycle Race This Morning</h3>
<p>Today is National Revival Day, and the sports authorities have organized men's and women's bicycle races.

<h3>Exhibition of Chinese Woodcuts to Be Held in London</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 24th] In cooperation with the British Parliament and the Chinese News Reporting Department, a Chinese woodcut exhibition will soon be held in London. The purpose of this exhibition is to enable the British art world to understand the significance of Chinese woodcuts during the war and how Chinese woodcuts maintained their artistic value in difficult circumstances. These woodcuts were collected by the Chongqing Woodcut Art Association. Most of the woodcut artists are not professionals, but only take woodcuts as an amateur pastime. The woodcuts represent the reality of Chinese life, so this exhibition has profound significance in terms of culture, art, and education.</p>
<h3>Cradle of Chinese Library Talent: Wuchang Wenhua Library School Builds a New Fortress on the North Bank of the Jialing River in Chongqing</h3>
<p>"Private Wuchang Wenhua Library School" is not an unfamiliar name. No matter in the north or south of the Yangtze River, as long as "Wenhua" is mentioned, no one does not know it. It and its predecessor—Wuchang Wenhua University—have had brilliant records in Chinese education, cultivating many talents for China. Its reputation abroad is as valued as "Tsinghua" and "St. John's," recognized as the only authoritative and long-standing training institution for library talents in China. Today, most of those engaged in the library business are directly or indirectly from the cradle of "Wenhua."</p>
<p>Withdrawal Westward with the Army</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance, "Wenhua" withdrew westward with the army, moving from Wuchang to Chongqing. In the campus of Qiujing Middle School in Zengjiawan, it found a few buildings to continue classes. Unfortunately, in the summer of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1941], it was destroyed by enemy aircraft, and it had to find another location. Finally, through the efforts of teachers and students, in less than a year, it built a new fortress on the north bank of the Jialing River, next to a sparsely populated town.</p>
<p>Liao Family Garden is a small garden that has been barren for a long time. Over the past three years, through continuous management and cultivation, it has become a beautiful little world. On a green triangular piece of land, there are three or five buildings. All kinds of flowers and plants welcome visitors from near and far throughout the year, such as peach and plum blossoms in spring, oleanders in summer, osmanthus and chrysanthemums in autumn, and double plum blossoms in winter, making this small world always dressed up, standing out among the mountains north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Gradual Expansion</p>
<p>When it first arrived at Liao Garden, there was only one building, where classes, meals, meetings, and sleeping all took place. Over the past three years, buildings have been built one after another, and today, they are sufficient for use. The spacious auditorium, the large library, the comfortable classrooms and bedrooms allow students to grow in a stable life. Recently, electric lights have been added, which makes this small garden even more colorful. Every night, looking from afar, the lights are interwoven into a beautiful night scene. The students are able to study peacefully today, first of all thanks to the old principal, Mr. Shen Zurong. He is a wise leader with a spirit of struggle and extraordinary perseverance!</p>
<p>Internal Departments</p>
<p>The school is now divided into two departments: Library Science and Archives Management. Including the two new classes recruited this summer vacation, there are only five classes, totaling 70 students. They are all enthusiastic young people from various provinces, all with education above high school. They all have great confidence in these two emerging subjects. They must study practical theories and techniques at the school for two years. Such as: Library Management, Administration, Chinese and Western Cataloging, Chinese and Western Bibliography, Classification, Various Classification Methods, Ordering Methods, Reference Work, Reference Books, Serials, Indexing, Character Searching, Archives Management and Administration, Archives Cataloging, Chinese and Western Archival Science, Information Management, Historical Materials Arrangement, Personnel Management, Official Document Research, Typing, Internship...etc., and each course overview, Chinese, English, second foreign language (German, Japanese, French), statistics, must complete one hundred credits within two years. Before graduation, a graduation thesis must be submitted, which must be approved by the professor meeting before graduation is allowed.</p>
<p>Experts Teach</p>
<p>The school's professors, regarding specialized subjects, are all domestic library science authorities and archives experts. Last year, Li Yongquan was hired to teach Museum Science. This year, Lu Huashen and Li Yongzeng were hired to teach Library Management, Administration, and Selection, etc. This shows that the school authorities, even in the case of extreme economic difficulties, are still constantly recruiting good teachers to strengthen the lineup.</p>
<p>In addition to specialized courses, the school authorities also deeply emphasize students' learning of foreign languages. For example, the organization of the English Speaking Society aims to allow students to use what they have learned in practice, to correct their pronunciation, tone, posture, and habits, to develop habits, and gradually lead them to the right path. Some courses, such as Cataloging, Reference Books, Bibliography, and Archival Science, also adopt original books and are taught in English. Also, such as projecting film books Microfilm Reading, etc., to train their audio-visual ability. All these facilities can promote the long-term progress of students.</p>
<p>Adding New Books</p>
<p>The library seems to be more active in this library school. In addition to being busy all day collecting materials for professors and helping students choose reference books and answer questions, it also needs to do a job and make a demonstration. Therefore, it has an extra responsibility than ordinary libraries. Under the principle of independent funding, new books are constantly flowing into the picture museum and are constantly circulating, like the daily journey of the sun, so that every reader has the right and opportunity to quickly enjoy new books. Recently, the British and American embassies have donated many books, and the American Library Association and various library schools have also donated a large number of books to the school, which will further increase the efficiency of the school library.</p>
<p>The school has a research department for the research of library science and archival science. For eight years, it can be said that there has been no moment of rest. There have been many new discoveries and creations. Unfortunately, because of the difficulty of wartime materials, it is impossible to print and publish them for the reference of the library community. Now that the War of Resistance has ended in victory, they are preparing to work hard in this area, and there will be some contributions in the near future. The person in charge now is Professor Xu Jialin, who holds a master's degree in library science from the United States.</p>
<p>Going Back to Wuchang</p>
<p>Restoration is the most urgent thing at the moment. As President Chiang said, restoration is not restoration. It is reported that "Wenhua" will not only move back to Wuchang, but also expand into a college, and will also establish a demonstration library, always walking ahead of people, assisting and leading the development of China's library business. However, the vastness of China needs too many people and too few talents. In order to train talents, in order to build libraries, there is a need for talents, and even more高级 talents and teachers. It is heard that the British and American library communities, in order to help the construction of our country's libraries, have successively established graduate scholarships for the further study of our country's library scholars. The relevant authorities in our country have also paid attention to this and will, in recent years, gradually select library science students to study abroad. Associate Professor Xu Jiabi of the school has already left for England at the beginning of last month to investigate the library business in England, and will also go to the United States to investigate library science education.</p>

<h3>A Merry Christmas Day – Remember the Displaced</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter, Jie</p>
<p>We are all new people, growing up in every corner of Shanghai, decadent and corrupt, dark and fallen. Now we must bravely repay this extravagant life! Comrades, let's train our minds and bodies today so that tomorrow we can be useful pillars of the nation. Wake up! Wake up! Let's go to classrooms and factories together. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, brilliance and candor are the guidelines for learning. Let's sweep away decadence, corruption, darkness, and depravity in our work! Comrades! Work hard! We are all new people, the force for building a new China!</p>
<p>Amidst this enthusiastic and magnificent song, we saw nearly a thousand refugees and orphans in desperate need of relief from charitable people in society, which moved me greatly! On the eve of the first Christmas after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all of Shanghai was intoxicated in a whirlwind of revelry—perhaps not noticing that in a very quiet corner of the city, the refugee and orphan shelter of the Shanghai Relief Institute in Caohejing, although they were also holding a Christmas celebration party, there were still more than forty poor fellow countrymen sleeping in hospital beds without anyone to sympathize with, pity, or help!</p>
<p>Eight years of gunfire may have cultivated cruelty in people's hearts. Although this horrific reality may have shocked them for a moment, it passed like fleeting clouds, becoming a thing of the past, and was easily forgotten. Seeing the grand hotels, ballrooms, and theaters filled with dignitaries, with guests feeling right at home, a scene of extravagant luxury, in stark contrast to those collapsing and dying on the street corners, reminds one of the ancient lament, "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, lie frozen corpses." Whose responsibility is this?</p>
<p>Many people only have hatred, disgust, and contempt for so-called vagrants, beggars, and petty thieves, without sympathy, compassion, or love. This corner of humanity is forever abandoned by society, living a miserable, subhuman life. Humans are, after all, the spirit of all things, great and loving. If they were not lost in their original nature, no one should despise their tragic plight. I can say with certainty that their becoming social dregs is not their fault, nor is it their responsibility!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee and Orphan Shelter was formerly the World Red Swastika Society's Livelihood Training Center for Displaced People. During the puppet regime, it was renamed a "Labor Camp." After the victory, it became a military camp for the National Army. It covers an area of over ninety-seven mu. On October 26th, the Social Bureau ordered its takeover. On November 1st, it officially began to take in refugees and orphans in Shanghai. In a short period of time, they mobilized their own strength to remove the knee-high weeds and piles of rubble, and established an elegant and beautiful environment from the barren land. The first thing that makes people feel good is the orderly arrangement, which combines solemnity and reverence.</p>
<p>As of Christmas Eve, they had taken in 966 refugees and orphans, most of whom were sent by the police, with very few coming on their own. There were 449 healthy adults, 464 children, 6 women, and 47 elderly and weak individuals, all classified according to their age and gender. The composition of these nearly a thousand people is extremely complex, including vagrants, beggars, local ruffians, hooligans, petty thieves, and even robbers, who are generally recognized as social outcasts; orphans who have lost both parents; illegitimate children who have been heartlessly abandoned; civil servants; small businessmen; and even college students who have attended institutions of higher learning. How to manage and guide these thousands of people is a serious problem. Director Zhou Zuwang pointed this out to the reporter, saying that they are now focusing on guidance, and have also established management of daily life, education, and special education groups. As for daily life, in short, spiritual well-being is paramount, and it is completely militarized. In addition to the two grand assemblies for raising and lowering the flag in the morning and evening, where spiritual speeches are given, physical training, labor service, individual talks, group discussions, etc., are carried out constantly every day. Their slogan is "Education and cultivation go hand in hand, work and study are equally emphasized." Their educational principle is that reading is more important than work for children, work is more important than reading for healthy adults, and care is the sole task for the elderly and weak.</p>
<p>To cultivate the self-governance spirit of the refugees and orphans, everything is managed by themselves. All forty-odd staff members are only responsible for supervision. They have divided many small units such as districts, households, and groups. In addition, according to the skills of the refugees, they have formed many work teams, such as masonry, carpentry, kitchen, sewing, and laundry.</p>
<p>Many refugees and orphans suffer from skin diseases, venereal diseases, and opium addiction, accounting for about 30% or more. The Health Bureau has now sent two doctors and three nurses to be stationed in the shelter to be responsible for diagnosis and treatment. If they encounter serious illnesses, they will be sent to Renji Hospital, Municipal Epidemic Hospital, or Municipal Hospital for treatment, so health is guaranteed.</p>
<p>The shelter is authorized to accommodate 1,200 to 1,500 people. The police department hopes that they can accommodate up to 10,000 people. Under the circumstances of a lack of money and materials, they can only hope that generous philanthropists in society will donate generously.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter would like to report that Mao Zipei, Director of the Social Welfare Department of the Social Bureau, Huang Tiren, Section Chief, and Commissioner Yan Changyan, etc., specially went to participate in the party last night, which is indeed admirable. Indeed, we cannot ignore this group of forgotten fellow countrymen.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Christmas</h3>
<p>— Zhang Peiyue</p>
<p>The Origin of Christmas</p>
<p>Generally, everyone believes that December 25th is the birthday of Jesus, and Christmas is to celebrate his birthday. In fact, the exact date of Jesus' birth has not been recorded in detail in history. In the beginning, people of various European and Western countries held seasonal celebrations every year during the winter solstice, roughly starting around December 25th. Later, Christians used the celebration of Christmas to replace the original entertainment, and that day gradually became Jesus' birthday. Everyone believed that Jesus was born at midnight on December 24th. But even now, when celebrating Jesus' birth, many ancient ethnic seasonal amusements are still preserved.</p>
<p>According to legend, the first celebration of Jesus' birth was by King Atal of England in York, England, in the year 521 AD.</p>
<p>Christmas Cards</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas" cards were invented by the British. At first, everyone just offered verbal congratulations. Later, the British became accustomed to calling out this phrase at the windows of every house on Christmas morning. Soon, everyone wrote greetings on letters and sent them to each other. It was not until 1846 that ten artists in London, named Kang Joseph, used lithography to print greetings and colored pictures, about the size of business cards. That was the first Christmas card.</p>
<p>Santa Claus</p>
<p>Santa Claus, wearing red clothes, dragging a white beard, and carrying a large bag of toys, can be said to be completely created for children. Therefore, Santa Clauses in various countries are all deified from the gods who protect children. The German god who protects children is Christkindleln, and Santa Claus is called Kriss, Kringle. In the Netherlands, it is St. Nicholas, and Santa Claus is still called St. Nicholas, but after it was introduced to the United States, it became Santaclaus. Although his name is slightly different in various places, his mission is the same, which is to increase the children's interest. So he always carries toys on his back, slips down from the chimney, and puts things in the socks hanging in front of the bed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of chimneys and socks, it is also very interesting. It turns out that the British have long had a custom similar to our year-end cleaning, and before the New Year, they must clean the chimney to let good luck come in. With a little combination, Santa Claus comes down from the chimney every time. Hanging socks was thought of by the British and Americans. Originally, Dutch children put their shoes by the stove, saying that Santa Claus must see the shoes placed there before putting the toys in them. The British and Americans are smarter and use socks. Socks can be stretched and are larger, so you can put more things in them.</p>
<p>Christmas Tree and Holly</p>
<p>The origin of the Christmas tree is said to be inconsistent. Some say it was started by Luther, who said that in order to show his children the scenery of snow-covered trees under starlight, he cut down a small fir tree in the garden, installed it in the house, and lit candles on it. That night was Christmas Eve, and later generations followed suit. But some say it was started by St. Boniface, who once cut down a large oak tree in the forest. When a gust of wind passed, many trees fell, but only a small fir tree stood still. St. Boniface then declared that this was a sacred tree, and it was used to decorate Christmas. The origin of using holly at Christmas is also very early. The ancient Romans used laurel branches to represent peace, victory, and joy. Later, Christians followed suit and used laurel branches to decorate windows, meaning that Jesus had entered. The British used holly to replace laurel branches. It is said that the white flowers of holly symbolize holiness, and the red berries symbolize the blood that Jesus shed for sinners. The holly wreath represents the crown of thorns worn on Jesus' head when he was martyred.</p>

<h3>Christmas and Santa Claus</h3>
<p>— Lequn</p>
<p>The god of war roared Santa Claus away so that he could freely reinforce his troops and satisfy his murderous desires. As a result, wars of aggression began, from East Asia to Western Europe, to the entire globe. The breath of continuous gunfire filled the world. Would Santa Claus dare to come down on Christmas Day?</p>
<p>But finally, the aggressors surrendered. Thus, this year's Christmas is going to be more lively than in previous years because people believe that in a "peaceful" world, Santa Claus will definitely be able to come to earth and grant people happiness. We also hope so, so that our people who have suffered for eight years can stretch their waists comfortably. Perhaps the government has designated Christmas as our national revival festival, with this intention in mind!</p>
<p>In the shop windows on the street, there are many different images of Santa Claus and Christmas trees, Christmas cards..., which make the street look too beautiful. Just like the chairman's portrait after the victory news was released, it's enough to rival it! Schools are on holiday, companies are closed, a scene of peace.</p>
<p>I went to the home of a foreign friend. Coincidentally, the friend's father, mother, younger sister, and younger brother were all squeezed together, arranging a Santa Claus pattern the size of a room. Looking at their energy, it's really interesting. According to that friend, they had already spent hundreds of yuan, and it wasn't completely successful yet. I was grateful to the friend's mother, who said that I was a foreigner and didn't know the inside story. She pointed out in detail, "This place is where Santa Claus enters, this place is where children receive blessings, this place is..." What surprised me was that Santa Claus doesn't go through the door or window, but comes down from the chimney. No wonder that friend's mother said I didn't understand the allusions.</p>
<p>This year's Santa Claus will be able to come down on Christmas, which is promising. Everyone who is looking forward to Christmas thinks so. As for me, I am the same.</p>
<h3>News Background</h3>
<p>— Yu Fan</p>
<p>Herbert H. Lehman, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, submitted a budget of 135 million yuan for the second year to Congress.</p>
<p>Someone in London suggested to a newspaper that it launch a movement to relieve European refugees, willing to save their own extremely meager rations and donate them to the cause. As a result, 30,000 people responded in mid-January.</p>
<p>An American soldier in France wrote to the editor of a newspaper, saying, "We really eat too richly and too deliciously. There are so many people, men and women, old and young, in Europe who are in a state of starvation. Why must we be fattened like pigs? Please give the surplus to make up for the deficiency. I am willing to eat less."</p>
<p>The United States and Europe form a sharp contrast. Words such as freezing, starvation, and hunger have long been forgotten in the United States. Christmas turkeys are being transported in truckloads; to avoid overcrowding for meat purchases, the price limit has been increased by two points per pound; the rationing system for leather shoes has been canceled, and they can be produced in large quantities and purchased freely; new "nylon" rayon stockings will be on the market for Christmas; Victory Company's unbreakable records are on the market; RCA's new money-free motors.</p>
<p>It is estimated that Japan will need to import 3.4 million tons of food next year, worth a total of 300 million yuan, to avoid famine. However, Japan itself does not have the ability, and it must not only rely on the Allied countries to lend this huge sum of money, but also rely on Allied ships to transport the food to Japan.</p>
<p>In China, eight years of continuous war and constant flight and wandering have made the people's need for relief extremely urgent, which no one dares to speculate on.</p>
<p>Anecdote</p>
<h3>My First Christmas</h3>
<p>— Zheng Biru, Junior Two, McTyeire School</p>
<p>Ah! How happy was Christmas when I was a child!</p>
<p>A week before Christmas, my mother and aunt took us to the company and asked us to choose our favorite gifts. I wanted a jump rope and a box of coloring paper, which I had wanted for a long time, although I couldn't color yet. My brothers each chose a seven-star sword with seven red stars and an air gun.</p>
<p>A few days before Christmas, I also attended Christmas service (it was my first time in my life). When the choir sang hymns in a melodious voice and slowly walked in, the two people in front held a golden cross and a bright red flag. I thought it was angels coming, and I happily clapped my little hands and shouted, "Ah! Mom, look! Little angels, little angels!" Mom quickly stopped me. The day before Christmas Eve, the living room was decorated with a Christmas tree, which was full of gold, silver, and colored Christmas bells and small stars, and countless light bulbs, blue, red, ... of various colors. A big star, one side silver and one side gold, stood at the top of the tree, which was also what we had been looking forward to for a long time. On Christmas Eve, after we finished our dinner, we sat in the living room and waited. After a while, the lights went out, and we shouted in unison, "Ah!" This shout was both surprised and happy. The surprise was that the lights went out, but at the same time, the lights on the Christmas tree turned on, so the shout turned into joy again. Ah! How beautiful! The five-colored lights reflected the gold and silver bells and stars, emitting a brilliant light that flickered, directly assaulting our eyes, almost unable to open them. The happiness at that time was indescribable. We jumped and laughed around the tree until we were tired before stopping.</p>
<p>This was my first Christmas as a child. Now, peace has arrived, and light has returned to the world. This year's Christmas is the first Christmas after peace, so I want to return to the way it was before and celebrate it to the fullest.</p>

<p>The breath of humans or animals can condense into fog in cold air. The colder the air, the easier it is to condense, and the more obvious the fog becomes. If the temperature is sixty to eighty degrees below the Fahrenheit freezing point, then a deer running by can leave a long white cloud, and when it stops running, the white fog immediately surrounds it, making it impossible to distinguish its shape from fifteen inches away.</p>

<h3>Rommel and the Wounded</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>In the North African campaign, the battle for Tobruk was the most intense. The city was entered and exited by the British and German armies several times, changing hands several times, resulting in a tragic seesaw battle. The following story took place in Tobruk and was told by a certain captain, the director of the British wounded soldier hospital in the city.</p>
<p>The first time Rommel's troops broke into Tobruk, the hospital still calmly carried on as usual. The wounded soldiers who were carried in, whether British or German, were treated the same.</p>
<p>The hospital suddenly became quiet. Rommel himself came. He stood and looked at the rows of hospital beds. He walked to a German wounded soldier, simply asked a question, and quietly listened to the wounded soldier tell him. He walked along a row of hospital beds, stopping from time to time to ask other German wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Finally, Rommel greeted the British captain. He said, "Our soldiers tell me that they are treated and cared for by you exactly the same as the British soldiers. You lack medicine, but you still share it with them. I will send someone to send medicine to you. You continue to work like this, and no one will bother you." After he finished speaking, he strode out.</p>
<p>The medicine was quickly delivered, and the hospital used these medicines to save many British and German soldiers. The hospital proceeded with its work without any interference or harassment.</p>
<p>After a few days, the situation suddenly changed. Rommel's troops abandoned the city and retreated, but when they retreated, the hospital was not damaged. The war situation shifted, and victories and defeats alternated, but the hospital only cared about carrying on with its work as usual.</p>
<p>Anecdote</p>
<h3>Lincoln Shines Shoes</h3>
<p>— Sun Xilin</p>
<p>One morning, the location was the White House.</p>
<p>A secretary visited the President "for official business." Led by the messenger to a large living room, walking to the shade, a man next to him was constantly shining his shoes, making a creaking sound. The secretary was about to walk past without paying attention, but was shocked and stopped.</p>
<p>It turned out that the President was shining his own shoes.</p>
<p>"You are the President, doing such a thing is quite unsightly when seen by others, especially by noble ladies..." The secretary had often heard people say behind his back that the President often showed the crude attitude of a country person, and kept it in his heart. This morning, he couldn't help but say this.</p>
<p>Lincoln, however, smiled and gave the secretary a surprised look:</p>
<p>"Oh, is shining shoes a shameful thing? The President and the shoe shiner are both public servants who work for the world. There should be no lowly occupations in the world, only people with inferior hearts."</p>
<p>It is hoped that today's high-ranking officials can all listen to President Lincoln's famous saying: "The President and the shoe shiner are both public servants who work for the world!"</p>

<h3>The Bells of Christmas Eve</h3>
<p>— Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>Sparse forests and short hedges trembled in the sharp north wind, and oak trees had already borne fruit. On this moonlit and windy night, the bells of Christmas Eve burst into sparks, flying from the spire over the rooftops, illuminating the souls of mankind.</p>
<p>The bells in the church, with their rises and falls, proclaimed peace and charity, and proclaimed all the virtues of mankind. The echoes of the bells fell on villages and hotels, fell on the hearths of deep mansions, warming the souls of mankind.</p>
<p>On this sacred night, no one heard the bells in the church without feeling a star in their heart, illuminating their dark future, giving them more courage to move forward on life's journey. Because the bells of Christmas Eve proclaimed peace and charity, which Christ exchanged with sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Truman, Sr.</h3>
<p>— Shen Yikun</p>
<p>President Truman's mother, Mrs. Martha Truman, was ninety-three years old last month but is still very healthy. She constantly reads the Congressional Record to know what those congressmen are saying. She said, "I want to live to be a hundred."</p>
<p>"Harry (President Truman's name) sends me the Congressional Record," she said with a smug look.</p>
<p>She has always read her books herself, and "without glasses." It wasn't until last year, because of a fall that affected her eyes, that Truman's sister, Miss Mary, read to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman, Sr., and Miss Truman live in Grandview, Jackson County, Missouri, not far from Kansas City. The whole town has 800 people. They live in a modern yellow flat house with five rooms, separated from Main Street by a path. Half a mile outside the town is the old Truman farm, where Mrs. Truman spent most of her years.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman was born on November 25, 1852, on a farm in what is now the southeastern residential area of Kansas City.</p>
<p>In 1881, she married John Truman, and two years later, moved to Lamar, 100 miles from Grandview. On May 8, 1884, President Truman was born there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman, Sr., pays close attention to Congress, but this is just one example of her concern for world affairs. She carefully reads the evening newspapers every day and clips them out. She likes to listen to the radio, especially news programs and operas.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman, Sr., said, "I don't think humans should have invented the atomic bomb. I am against killing. Harry is also a supporter of peace."</p>
<p>She had three grandsons who participated in World War II: Sergeant Harry Truman (named after the president) recently retired from Camp Robinson and participated in the campaigns in France, Germany, and Austria; and two were the sons of the president's brother, Vivian.</p>

<h3>Relief Supplies Sold at Reduced Prices: Methods Should Be Improved to Ensure Benefit for the Common People</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>American aid relief supplies have been arriving in Shanghai in large quantities since last month, including wheat, flour, medicine, old clothes, canned goods, fruits, construction materials, burlap sacks, trucks, and more than ten other items. As of now, in addition to a large amount of flour distributed by the Shanghai branch of the China Relief Administration to various charitable organizations and Jewish residents, flour and canned food items have also been placed on the market for general sale at reduced prices. According to Mr. Jiang Tingfu, Director of the China Relief Administration, in his previous discussions in Peiping, these relief supplies are not entirely free to the people, but are sold at reduced prices in a work-for-relief program, with prices reduced by five percent compared to market prices. Therefore, the price of flour in this city is also 1,900 yuan per bag. We have no objection to the use of reduced-price sales for relief supplies, but the purpose of transporting these supplies to China is to relieve the general public suffering from high prices after the war, especially the poor who cannot make a living. Flour, in particular, is a daily staple for the common people, and is rarely consumed by those above the middle class. Therefore, it seems too harsh to set the price at only five percent lower than market prices, which is not in line with the meaning of "relief." Not only do the common people benefit very little, but most still suffer from being unable to afford it. Furthermore, many stalls that mainly use flour to make pancakes and other foods have not lowered their prices despite the abundance of flour on the market, which is strong evidence. As for the canned fruits and dried apricots sold at reduced prices recently, some cans cost as much as 2,500 yuan, which is difficult even for the middle class to afford. As a result, they are inevitably bought by the wealthy, and the advertisement prominently stating "Charitable Relief Sale at Reduced Prices" seems even more out of touch.</p>

<h3>Vehicles Keep Right, Right Hand Wrap Red Cloth</h3>
<p>— Gu Si</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that vehicles will drive on the right side of the road starting on New Year's Day, I am afraid that Chinese and foreign drivers will find it difficult to reform suddenly, causing accidents and endangering everyone. Regarding this matter, I have recently come up with a method that may be helpful. That method is to have every driver wear a red cloth on the sleeve of their right hand, so that the driver pays attention at all times. When the vehicle wants to turn, the driver will see the red cloth and be shocked, and naturally turn to the right. It can also serve as a constant reminder to drive to the right when driving parallel. This method is also very effective for bicycles, tricycles, and rickshaws. If this is done, it will become a habit after two months.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: After reading the "Carefree Theory of Lung Disease" published in your newspaper these past few days, I couldn't help but feel secretly overjoyed. I am 21 years old this year, and I recently weighed 128 and a half pounds. My chest is also quite broad and comfortable. From the outside, my physique seems very strong. However, since an X-ray last autumn revealed tuberculosis in my left lung, I have been taking good care of myself. Although my condition has not worsened in the past year, it has not improved either. I usually cough up a lot of phlegm, and sometimes there is blood in it. This prolonged condition is a deep concern. Now that I have seen your column, I have a few questions, namely, is the method of "compressing the lesion" effective for all stages of lung disease? And how much does it cost approximately? My family lives in Jiangbei, and I am lodging alone at school. All expenses must be budgeted in advance. I would be especially grateful if you could recommend a reliable doctor. Your column has always taken serving the public as its responsibility, and I believe it will not disappoint me.</p>

<p>(Editor's Answer) Compression therapy (i.e., pneumothorax) is best treated early. Please seek treatment at the Red Cross Hospital. The fee is approximately 10,000 yuan or more per year.</p>
