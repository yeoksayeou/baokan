<p>— 寒生</p>
<p>言論自由足以增加知識，宣揚人民情意，提高人民政治興趣，近世憲政諸國，莫不加以保障。我國官史，且多曾任新聞記者，對於言　自由的價値，當然尤爲珍視。</p>
<p>正當一國在革命建設的過程之中，必須對於人民善爲指導，蓋革命爲新當兩大力量的鬥爭，要使舊的知識不致妨碍新的知識，然後方能與民衆意志齊一，建設新的國家，實現革命目的。因此，在新聞報道上是必須與此配合的，換言之，民主國決不能容復辟之言論，社會主義國決不能容反社會主義之言論，此理極爲明　。</p>
<p>耶穌說：你必須識責眞理，眞舉才能讓你自由。就是設自由之範圍，不能求之於眞理之外。有一位擁護自由王義之政治學者羅威爾，在其所著的與論與民主政府一書中，所主張國民對於其國家當前的重大問題，必有共同的意見，始足以養成優良的民意。所以，近代各國的憲法，對於言論自由的保障，也並非漫無邊際，檢查制度，乃一種間養的法律保障，以求適應國家民族當前的需要、</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，如因新聞檢查制度的不　全，而報紙所載的多屬重要軍機，因此，在戰事上蒙受極大不利。所以，必須實行嚴格檢查，這種反宣傳作用的資料就可絕跡，報紙本身也漸覺此種資料之有害國家，自動停止記載發表。其次，如以上海報紙爲例，渦去社會新聞中頗多盜刧姦淫的記載，充斥滿紙，不　傷害優良風俗，抑且破壞社會治安，這種現象的造成當然由於新聞檢查制度的不良。</p>
<p>第一例是屬於軍事方面的，第二例是屬於社會方面的，前者可以證明檢查制度積極的功效，後可以證明、　在制度消極的功收。</p>
<p>戰時的言論記載，尤其不可不慎。我們已有戰時新聞檢查和圖書雜誌審查的辦法，予人民以言論自由的範圍。其他雖以民主中央自許的國家業有檢查制度，確立此等檢查制度，縱使方法不同，範圍不同，其保障國家民族利益，防止諱言作戰努力的用意，則無二致。任何一種制度，決難盡善盡美，必須時時求乞改進，出版物檢查制度，自然不能例外。</p>
<p>目前新出版的列物，風氣極盛，而其趨向，似乎都是要求言論的自由，一般的說，固然是好的現象，不過，仍不能忽略戰時國家的必需。因此，對於管理言論出版，在辦法方面，有沒有商榷的必要，在範圍方面，有沒有可以　整的地方，使人民的言論更能得到保障。我們相信宣傳部方面必時在縝密研究改善方針之中。我們認爲首先廣徵文化界及出版界的意見，然後養成最合理的辦法，建議政府經過立法　序，另行決定切要而又簡明之檢查法，務期全國上下一致遵行，在法紀精神之中，積極扶　　全　　的　　，　定中國復興建設的基礎</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電此間觀測，波次坦會同宣言中，關於東亞問題，尤其關於日本及太平洋問題，毫無隻字提及，殊令人注目。日·蘇兩國間尙有中立條約存在，更有特殊理由引起全世界注意，而日本亦本中立條約之精神，自然更加努力，以建樹日蘇兩國之友好關係，且此項方針，決非波次坦宣言等所能左右者也。</p>

<h3 id="c19">貝當繼續受審賴伐爾出庭作證　自稱係忠實共和黨員 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電據巴黎訊：前維希政府首長賴伐爾，昨日在貝當元首受審時曾出庭爲見證人，賴氏一再爲其首長之職務努力辯護。渠供稱，「我曾力與「戰爭」爭鬥，使其不致爆發，至於我開始與員當元首發生政治關係之時，我想大約在一九三四年，其時我已覺到法國外交政策，必將使法國導入戰禍，我決不願見其他國中發生擾亂。而當時我之法國亦極爲安樂興盛，決並與其他鄰國戰爭之理由」同時渠又闡明渠在戰前之外交政策謂，『我曾割讓與墨索里尼之土地，僅爲一四○·○○○米突之沙壤而已，至於法義之秘密軍事協定，亦因我欲對抗德國而簽訂之，再關於在義大大利侵略阿比西尼亞時所訂立之霍爾，賴伐爾協定，實爲我之一種計劃，然該項計劃卒爲倫敦巴黎兩方面之政兩人俱在。」言時渠回首向賴伐爾高聲曰，「其時賴伐爾，汝曾言「此後法共和國將安在」」。庭上一度鬥動，賴伐爾頗露篤慌之狀而急答曰，「我不能記憶及此，或當時說笑話，我本人係一共和黨員，我決不致欲推翻共和國，我既非法西斯黨又非納粹主義僧徒，我實一共和黨黨員」。此時法庭暫吿憇息，於四十分鐘之後繼續審訊，蒙底包克斯檢查官向賴伐爾訊問如何將訂立法國之憲法權授與貝常乃與政府方面共同執有立　權，蓋貝當單獨一人決不能公佈一憲法案，我與貝當意見不同之處甚多」。及後由評審團向渠詢及一九四○年之維希政府國會時，渠答稱，「當國會於其時在維希秘密召集時，出席議員有七百名，其中竟無一名直接或間接對「停戰協定」表示反對，汝等不應將其他無經騐之閣員所犯之一切錯誤，均歸於貝當一身」云。</p>
<h3 id="c20">兩月來之浙江（一） <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 博英</p>
<p>浙江原屬東南富庶之區，亦沿海重要省份，無論在政府，經濟，文化各部門，均佔重要地位。但事變以來，因遭戰爭毀壞，其繁榮已遠不如昔。丁黜邨氏蒞浙主持軍政，爲時雖僅兩閱月（六七兩個月），但因銳意整頓，夙夜不懈，尤將民間痛苦，次第解除。故在短短兩月中，行政，　政，經濟，文教，治安各方面，均有顯著進步。最近記者向省府及浙省各方面訪問所得，特將浙省六七兩月施政實况，分別報道如左：</p>
<h3 id="c21">溝通民意 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>爲政之道，在於把握民心。尤其要上情下達，下情上達，方可使政府與人民打成一片，而收行政推進之効。浙省自事變至今，並無眞正民意機構，上下之間，不免隔膜，丁省長下車伊始，即羅致浙省地方公正士紳及各界領袖，設立浙江省諮詢委員會。並令飭各縣亦組織縣諮詢委員會。推廣民意機構，並設置民衆意見箱，博採與情。現經省府方面採納省諮詢委員會建議，而付諸實施者，如設置米糧採辦機構，以防靑黃不接時，米價再度上漲。聲頓現有航路，便利運輸。採辦柴薪，以解決杭市柴荒。獎勵私人普設簡易小學，以救濟失學兒童。籌設時疫醫院，以保護人民生命安全。整理名勝古跡，以保國粹等等。俱屬勤求民隱，採納興情之充分表現。至於各縣諮詢委員會。現均正在進行設置中，計已呈報成立者，有杭縣等十餘縣。不久當可普遍設置，使浙省一切在官民協力下邁步推進。</p>
<h3 id="c22">調節民食 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>近年以來，糧食恐慌，已成各地普遍現象，浙省自亦不能例外。就實際而言，浙省糧食產量，盈虧相濟，本屬不數目給。事變前，全省產量，不敷百分之二十，其補足之法，唯有仰給於鄰省，事變後，加之農村生產減低，以及交通治安等關係，其遭受之嚴重現象，更勝於前。本年五月，杭市米價，竟高出上海三分之一。自丁氏蒞任後，對民食恐慌，嚴密注意，並經派員向京·蕪·江蘇及浙凍各地絡續採辦米糧，上海等地採購麵粉，以資調節，並嚴厲執行國府米糧緊急措置命令，未及兼句，米價頓吿下挫，目前杭市米價，已反低於滬蘇各地。最近復另行組織採辦機構，進行採辦工作，以防食米再度上漲，同時積極計劃增加生產，使民食問題，得根本解決。近兩月來，杭市米價漲風，已不復再起，經常較上海等地爲低，殊不易自力也。</p>
<h3 id="c23">調整吏治 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>縣爲行政之基礎，必須縣政健全，省政始能推行。丁氏對於縣制，遵照中央規定，參配浙省情形，經擬訂各縣暫行組織。其要旨在提高縣長權力，使能擔當全縣繁重責任。對某某數縣，並擬提高地位，向中央正式呈請簡任。丁氏對於縣長人選，一秉大公精神，純係人才主義，並儘量引用折籍人士、使爲桑梓服務。對原任　長，倘非發生過失，決不輕易更調，其自請辭職，每多予慰留。又縣長警察局長，保安隊長，均負地方守土之者，嚴令非經核准，不得擅離職守。了氏到任兩月，吏治漸趨明期。</p>
<p>浙省公務員待遇，過去每校中央及他省爲低，丁氏於六月份，已稍提高。七月份起，完全依照中央規定普遍提高，（薦任宣照底薪加一千倍）俾安生活。至各縣政府及各區行政督察專員公署經費，亦將普遍提高。上半年度一等縣行政經費，每月原定二十萬元，七月份起，將增達五百餘萬元云。</p>
<h3 id="c24">整頓稅收 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>財政爲事業之母，政令推行，尤以財政豐絀爲轉移。浙省三十四年上半年度支出槪算爲十萬萬兀，每月平均約須一萬六十萬元。但一月至三月，即入不敷出，丁氏於六月起，鮵意整頓，並以不增加人民負擔爲原則，其主要方法，純爲剔除中飽，使稅收所入涓滴歸公。並就原有田賦，營業稅，專稅，及消費稅等，分別整理，而不另闢新的稅源。一面厲行會計制度，特設會計處，令其嚴密稽核。並特設消費特稅處，積極整理消費稅，參照現在物價，提高各局消費稅比額。計自七月份起施行，收入增加，頗有可觀。至田賦徵收，經仿照江蘇辦法，擇定比較交通便利及治安鞏固縣份，如杭縣，嘉興等縣，先行開徵三十四年上季田賦徵收實物，對於三十四年下季田賦，將各縣財政局撤銷，普設各縣田賦徵收處，派縣長兼任處長，另由省府派副處長一人，實行督導徵收工作，倘田賦徵實辦有效果，則所有軍保警及公務員食米問題，自可迎刃而解。所有各項稅收，過去提成制度，亦予廢除，嚴定公開比額，乃參照各市縣地方情形與治安狀況及購買力之强弱，釐訂標準，實行按季查報。並重定各局等次，發給適當經費及更訂獎懲考績規程等，對各稅稅收，必能益有增加云。</p>
<h3 id="c25">改進文教事業 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>###</p>
<p>浙省文教事業，素稱發達，事變以還破壞甚多，丁氏到任首先通令所有文教人員，以任用本省人士爲原則，次則提高教育人員待遇，寬籌教育經費。按浙省敎職員待遇較公務員尤關於師資方面，亦力求整齊，最近舉辦全省小學敎師第二次總登記，及籌辦師資訓練班輪流訓練現在小學敎員，以養成敎育人材。更進一步，愼選地方教育行政人員，嚴格教育制度之考核，並屬政飭學風，以抑制學生不良習氣，復爲强化及提倡生產教育，而將職業學校添授農業課程，兼令各校利用空地種植雜糧，增加生產，並籌設小型工塲製造工業出品。其次浙省日語敎師程度參差，特利用暑假期間，舉辦日語補習會，以資深造，關於文化方面，因鑒於省立圖書館之書版散置，未加整理，爲保存國粹，特撥巨款，飭令整理。博物館方面，動植物標本所用酒精，久未調換，致標本即將腐爛，感前人採擇之不易，爲保存文化計，經分別調換。該圖書館及博物館整理後已面目一新。復次關於名勝古蹟，事變後類多損壞，亦經設立名勝古跡整理委員會，邀請地方人士參加，從事修葺整理。（未完）</p>

<p>市府於昨制定上海特別市政府配給俸米暫行辦法公布施行，同時將前物品配給處所訂上海特別市物品配給處辦理市府曁所屬各局處公務員役俸米配給辦法廢止，該辦法要點如下：</p>
<p>本府及所屬各機關職工，曁市縣立各學校敎職員工，暫定每人每月免費配給俸米三斗，由經濟局發給之。</p>

<p>郊區員警每月一律配給俸米三斗。前項俸米暫由經濟局發給，縣員警配給另案規定。</p>
<p>保安隊之俸米配給官兵一律三斗，其駐紮市區者按照規定手續向經濟局讀領之，凡駐紮各縣區者，一律由各該縣微起至寶物內按照規定撥給之，倘各縣區微起寶物不敷支配時，應專案呈府統籌調劑之。</p>

<p>市財政局對於所屬各縣田賦征收實物之第一期工作，早經全面開始，本月上旬左右，首批實物米糧及小麥，可望運輸來滬。據向關係方面探悉，此次財政局征收田賦實物，成績頗爲良好，即在此靑黃不接之際，而所收到之實物，大致可達到預算數字，今後市府及各局處公務員之俸米食糧等配給，已可照常辦理。該首批實物抵滬時，將由財政。警察。經濟三局會同檢收，其保管者，將由經濟局擔任之。此後分批運滬，手續仍屬如此。至於田賦征收實物之第一期，照規定至本月底爲終了日期，倘逾期不繳田賦，亦決照定章處以滯納罰金。聞本年度第二期征收田賦實物，於十月份起亦可分別開始辦理。</p>

It has also authorized 200,000 yuan for funeral expenses to express its deep respect for his veteran achievements. The National Government's order is as follows:</p>
<p>Gu Zhongchen, President of the Control Yuan, was a respected elder statesman of profound character and depth.

His contributions were immense. Afterwards, he followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen, was loyal to the party and the nation, took on difficult tasks with unwavering resolve. In recent years, he earnestly promoted peace, demonstrating outstanding service. He was promoted from Vice President of the Control Yuan to his current position. He dedicated himself to rectifying the times and governed himself with rectitude, upholding official decorum with dignity and integrity. Just as we relied on him to jointly build the nation, he passed away due to overwork. Deeply saddened by the loss of such a wise and capable leader, we should grant him a special commendation and allocate 200,000 yuan for funeral expenses. The Executive Yuan is instructed to direct the Ministry of Personnel to provide generous posthumous honors. His life's accomplishments shall be recorded in the National History Museum to demonstrate the nation's utmost respect for his veteran contributions. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch—</p>
<p>Due to the repeated bombings of the city by American aircraft last month, a large number of citizens were killed and injured. Governor Chu has devised a method to raise a large sum of money to purchase medicine for relief purposes. He convened a tea party at the International Club at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, gathering city gentry, merchants, and prominent figures from various sectors to discuss methods for providing relief to bombing victims. They approved the organization of the Guangzhou Bombing Victims Relief Association, appointed multiple committee members, and immediately secured over 17 million yuan in relief donations from wealthy gentlemen. They also scheduled the first committee meeting for 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss all matters related to the association's progress.</p>

<p>Xuzhou, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch—</p>
<p>At 10:20 AM on the 3rd, twelve B-25 aircraft led by a P-38 type aircraft based in Chongqing, in four formations, invaded the city's airspace and indiscriminately dropped a large number of aerial bombs and cluster bombs on the commercial district of Nanguan, destroying dozens of houses and causing casualties among the populace, reaching 400. They circled for over an hour before fleeing. The citizens felt extreme hatred for the enemy aircraft's brutal actions. Furthermore, it is reported that yesterday enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed the city's commercial district, causing many civilian casualties. Governor Hao, upon hearing the news, immediately went to the disaster area to inspect the situation. He instructed the provincial hospital to provide free medical treatment to the injured victims and donated 10 million yuan to the Air Raid Relief Committee to be used for disaster relief.</p>

<p>Beiping, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch—According to recent intelligence, Fu Zuoyi, Deputy Commander of the Eighth War Zone in Chongqing, and Hu Zongnan's troops are coordinating their attacks. 新华社 [Xinhua News Agency] frontline dispatch dated July 25th stated that Fu Zuoyi's troops began attacking the Eighth Route Army on June 10th, and fierce fighting has continued for 45 days with no end in sight. Approximately 15,000 soldiers under Fu Zuoyi are currently gathering in Gui Dai [Guida], away from Suiyuan Province's capital. Another large force is fiercely attacking the Eighth Route Army near Zhu Nangou [Zhu Nangou], 20 kilometers north of Gui Sui [Guisui]. At the same time, a TASS dispatch from Chongqing also stated that the Chongqing Military Commission is actively increasing military preparedness on the northwestern border. They have divided Fu Zuoyi's garrison area in Suiyuan into four war zones: East, West, North, and Central, and are strengthening military equipment. It is also reported that a large force crossed the Yellow River west of Huayuan [Huayuan] on June 29th. Furthermore, an Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing stated that Chongqing troops have recently been actively advancing into the northwest and are working to build automobile roads, transporting over 2,000 tons of military supplies. Fu's actions deserve serious attention.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Yu (Chongqing) Appoints Wang Shijie as Foreign Minister <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, July 3rd, Central News Agency Dispatch—</p>
<p>Following the reorganization of the Executive Yuan in Yu (Chongqing), Wang Shijie has been appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The position of Minister of Information, vacated by Wang, will be concurrently held by the Minister of Social Affairs, Gu Zhenggang, who will also concurrently hold the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, previously held by Sheng Shicai and Luo Guangjun. Other ministers will retain their positions. The core of this reorganization of the Executive Yuan in Yu (Chongqing) is the replacement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Yu-Chongqing United News Agency observed as follows: Wang Shijie is the most outstanding theorist within the Yu (Chongqing) faction and a steadfast politician with the demeanor of a scholar. He also holds considerable influence within the Kuomintang. In these turbulent times, his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs is highly anticipated. When Wang assumed the position of Minister of Information last December, he declared his intention to improve relations with the Soviet Union. He also undertook the task of Yu-Yan (Chongqing-Yan'an) negotiations last June, personally traveling to Yan'an for this purpose. As for Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Information, he is a steadfast member of Wang's faction. According to the United News Agency's conjecture, after the Wang faction gains power this time, they will ostensibly adopt a conciliatory attitude towards Yan'an, but will still seek to intensify the pressure on Yan'an.</p>

<p>Nanjing, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch—</p>
<p>In order to strengthen party affairs and coordinate with the administration, the Chinese Kuomintang plans to merge the Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters and the Hankou Special City Party Headquarters during the upcoming election.

The reasons for the merger are: 1. Hankou Special City has been changed to an ordinary city for over a year, and party affairs should be coordinated with the administrative structure. 2. Hubei and Hankou are located on the front lines, and party affairs should have unified leadership to strengthen them.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Freedom of Speech and the Censorship System <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Han Sheng</p>
<p>Freedom of speech can increase knowledge, express the feelings of the people, and enhance the people's political interests. All modern constitutional countries protect it. Most of our country's officials have served as journalists and naturally value the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>During a country's process of revolution and construction, the people must be guided well. Revolution is the struggle between old and new forces. To prevent old knowledge from hindering new knowledge, the will of the people must be unified to build a new country and achieve the goals of the revolution. Therefore, news reports must be coordinated with this. In other words, a democratic country cannot tolerate counter-revolutionary speech, and a socialist country cannot tolerate anti-socialist speech. This principle is extremely clear.</p>
<p>Jesus said, "You must know the truth, and the truth will set you free." This means that the scope of freedom cannot be sought outside of truth. Lowell, a political scientist who advocated for the kingly way of freedom, argued in his book "Public Opinion and Popular Government" that a nation must have a common opinion on its major current problems to cultivate good public opinion. Therefore, modern constitutions of various countries also do not guarantee freedom of speech without limits. The censorship system is an indirect legal safeguard to adapt to the current needs of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>During wartime, if the news censorship system is incomplete, and newspapers contain a lot of important military secrets, it can cause great disadvantages in the war. Therefore, strict censorship must be implemented so that such counter-propaganda materials can be eliminated. Newspapers themselves will gradually realize the harm of such materials to the country and automatically stop recording and publishing them. Secondly, taking Shanghai newspapers as an example, in the past, social news contained many reports of theft, robbery, rape, and adultery, filling the pages. This not only harmed good customs but also disrupted social order. This phenomenon was naturally caused by the poor news censorship system.</p>
<p>The first example pertains to military matters, and the second pertains to social matters. The former can prove the active effect of the censorship system, while the latter can prove the passive effect of the system.</p>
<p>Speech and records during wartime must be especially cautious. We already have measures for wartime news censorship and review of books and magazines to give people a scope of freedom of speech. Other countries that claim to be democratic and central have censorship systems. Although the methods and scope may be different, the intention to protect the interests of the nation and the people and prevent the suppression of war efforts is the same. It is difficult for any system to be perfect. It must constantly seek improvement. The publication censorship system is no exception.</p>
<p>Currently, the trend of new publications is extremely strong, and their direction seems to be towards demanding freedom of speech. Generally speaking, this is a good phenomenon. However, the necessities of the country during wartime cannot be ignored. Therefore, is there a need to discuss the management of speech and publication in terms of methods? Is there a need to adjust the scope to better protect the people's speech? We believe that the Propaganda Department must be conducting meticulous research on improvement plans. We believe that the first step is to solicit opinions from the cultural and publishing communities and then develop the most reasonable method. We suggest that the government, through legislative procedures, separately determine essential and concise censorship laws to ensure that the whole country follows them consistently. In the spirit of law and discipline, actively support and promote the healthy development of speech and lay the foundation for China's revitalization and construction.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, this county has had moderate and well-distributed rainfall, and the rice has been growing rapidly. The early rice crop has now entered the market.

In the future, a large amount of new rice from the four villages will flood the market, and rice prices are bound to fall.</p>

<p>Stockholm, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— London reports: The British Foreign Office issued a statement at 10:30 PM on the 3rd as follows: "During the Potsdam Conference, the representatives of the British and American Chiefs of Staff held daily meetings and worked hard to discuss all the details regarding the destruction of the Japanese Army and Navy and the early unconditional surrender of Japan. Also, in order to liberate the areas occupied by the Japanese military, the deployment of British and American troops was adjusted. All British Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel who can be freely deployed will be used for attacks on Japan. There was considerable discussion on issues such as determining the commander of the Southwest Pacific and Southeast Asia regions, and utilizing the forces of other allied countries that are at war with Japan. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have issued this statement, which is of great significance in light of the current international situation. "According to Reuters, after the British Foreign Office issued the above statement, it added that "the war against Japan is currently being borne only by the United Kingdom and the United States", so this statement was not issued at the same time as the communiqué of the Three-Power Conference, but was only announced tonight. However, this point cannot be inferred that the Soviet Union will not participate in the East Asian war.</p>

<p>Moscow, Central News Agency Dispatch— A commentary in 真理报 [Pravda] stated that after the end of the European war, the international situation is extremely complex, so the agreement of the Potsdam Conference is of great significance, confirming that the three countries of this historic conference have reached mutual understanding to ensure and consolidate true peace. The Soviet people welcome the success of the Three-Power Conference, as the conference is sufficient to enhance the ties between the three countries. The Soviet people are confident that the decisions made based on this conference will contribute greatly to peace and security among nations.</p>

<p>Tokyo, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— Observers here note that the Potsdam Declaration makes no mention of East Asian issues, especially Japan and the Pacific, which is particularly noteworthy. There is still a neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, and there is more special reason to attract worldwide attention, and Japan is naturally working harder in the spirit of the neutrality treaty to build friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and this policy will never be swayed by the Potsdam Declaration, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Pétain Continues to Be Tried, Laval Testifies, Claims to Be a Loyal Republican <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 4th, Central News Agency Dispatch— According to Paris reports, former Vichy government leader Laval testified as a witness yesterday during the trial of Marshal Pétain. Laval repeatedly defended his leader's efforts. He testified, "I have strived to fight 'war' so that it does not break out. As for when I began to have political relations with Marshal Pétain, I think it was around 1934, when I realized that French foreign policy would inevitably lead France into war. I do not want to see disturbances in other countries. At that time, my France was also extremely peaceful and prosperous, and there was no reason to go to war with other neighboring countries." At the same time, he also clarified his pre-war foreign policy, saying, "I only ceded to Mussolini a land of 140,000 meters of sandy soil. As for the secret French-Italian military agreement, it was signed because I wanted to confront Germany. Furthermore, regarding the Hoare-Laval Pact signed during Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, it was my plan, but the plan was ultimately rejected by the politicians in London and Paris." At that time, Pétain raised his voice to Laval and said, "Laval, you once said, 'Where will the French Republic be in the future?'" The court was once moved, and Laval showed some signs of panic and hurriedly replied, "I cannot remember this. Maybe I was joking. I am a Republican and would never want to overthrow the Republic. I am neither a Fascist nor a Nazi acolyte. I am really a Republican." At this time, the court temporarily adjourned and continued the trial after forty minutes. Prosecutor Montebou questioned Laval how the power to enact the French constitution was granted to Pétain and how he jointly held the 立　权 [legislative power] with the government. Pétain alone could not promulgate a constitutional bill. There were many differences between my opinion and Pétain's." Later, when asked by the jury about the Vichy government parliament in 1940, he replied, "When the parliament secretly convened in Vichy at that time, 700 members attended, and none of them directly or indirectly expressed opposition to the 'armistice agreement'. You should not attribute all the mistakes made by other inexperienced cabinet members to Pétain alone."</p>
<h3 id="e20">Zhejiang in the Past Two Months (1) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Ying</p>
<p>Zhejiang was originally a prosperous area in the southeast and also an important coastal province, occupying an important position in the government, economy, culture, and other departments. However, since the Incident, due to war damage, its prosperity is far from what it used to be. Although Mr. Ding Chu-cun has been in charge of military and political affairs in Zhejiang for only two months (June and July), he is determined to rectify the situation and works tirelessly day and night, especially to alleviate the suffering of the people. Therefore, in a short period of two months, there has been significant progress in administration, politics, economy, culture, education, and security. Recently, the reporter visited the provincial government and various aspects of Zhejiang Province and reports on the actual situation of Zhejiang Province's administrative measures in June and July as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e21">Communicating Public Opinion <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The way to govern lies in grasping the will of the people. In particular, it is necessary for directives from above to reach the lower levels and for information from below to reach the upper levels. Only in this way can the government and the people be integrated and achieve the effect of promoting administration. Since the Incident [likely refers to the Second Sino-Japanese War], Zhejiang Province has lacked a truly representative public opinion mechanism, and there is inevitably a disconnect between the upper and lower levels. As soon as Governor Ding took office, he recruited local impartial gentry and leaders from various circles in Zhejiang Province to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Advisory Committee. He also ordered each county to organize a County Advisory Committee. Public opinion mechanisms were promoted, and public opinion boxes were set up to widely solicit opinions. The provincial government has adopted and implemented the suggestions of the Provincial Advisory Committee, such as establishing a grain purchasing agency to prevent rice prices from rising again when the new harvest is not yet available, dredging existing waterways to facilitate transportation, purchasing firewood to solve the firewood shortage in Hangzhou, encouraging private individuals to establish simple primary schools to help out-of-school children, establishing epidemic hospitals to protect the safety of the people's lives, and renovating famous historical sites to preserve the national essence. All of these are full expressions of diligently seeking out the people's concerns and adopting suggestions. As for the County Advisory Committees, they are currently being established, and more than ten counties, including Hangzhou County, have already reported their establishment. It will soon be possible to establish them universally, so that everything in Zhejiang Province can be promoted with the cooperation of officials and the people.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Regulating the People's Food Supply <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, food panic has become a common phenomenon everywhere, and Zhejiang Province is no exception. In reality, Zhejiang Province's grain production has been barely sufficient. Before the Incident, the province's output was less than 20% of what was needed, and the only way to make up for the deficiency was to rely on neighboring provinces. After the Incident, coupled with the decline in rural production and transportation and security issues, the severity of the situation has become even worse than before. In May of this year, the price of rice in Hangzhou was actually one-third higher than in Shanghai. Since Mr. Ding took office, he has paid close attention to the food panic, and has sent personnel to Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiangsu, and eastern Zhejiang to continuously purchase grain, and to purchase flour from Shanghai and other places for regulation, and strictly implemented the national government's emergency measures for grain. In a short time, rice prices fell sharply. At present, rice prices in Hangzhou have fallen lower than those in Shanghai and Jiangsu. Recently, a purchasing agency has been organized to carry out purchasing work to prevent food prices from rising again, and at the same time, plans are actively being made to increase production so that the people's food problem can be fundamentally solved. In the past two months, the rising rice prices in Hangzhou have not recurred, and they have often been lower than those in Shanghai and other places, which is not easy to achieve independently.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Adjusting Officialdom <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The county is the foundation of administration. Only with sound county administration can provincial administration be implemented. Mr. Ding has formulated provisional organizations for the counties in accordance with the central government's regulations and with reference to the situation in Zhejiang Province. The main purpose is to increase the power of the county magistrate so that he can shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the entire county. It is also planned to raise the status of certain counties and formally request the central government to appoint them as key counties. Mr. Ding adheres to the spirit of impartiality in the selection of county magistrates, focusing purely on talent and making every effort to employ Zhejiang natives to serve their hometowns. Incumbent magistrates will not be easily transferred unless they have committed misconduct, and resignations are often met with retention. In addition, county magistrates, police chiefs, and security team leaders are responsible for defending the local area, and are strictly prohibited from leaving their posts without approval. In the two months since Mr. Ding took office, the officialdom has gradually become clearer.</p>
<p>In the past, the salaries of civil servants in Zhejiang Province were lower than those of the central government and other provinces. Mr. Ding slightly increased them in June. Starting in July, they have been fully increased in accordance with the central government's regulations (recommended appointments and above receive a basic salary plus 1,000 times), so as to ensure their livelihood. The funding for county governments and district administrative inspector's offices will also be universally increased. The administrative expenses of first-class counties in the first half of the year were originally set at 200,000 yuan per month, and starting in July, they will be increased to more than 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Rectifying Tax Revenue <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Finance is the mother of enterprise, and the promotion of government orders depends on the abundance or scarcity of finances. Zhejiang Province's estimated expenditures for the first half of the 34th year [likely refers to 1945] were 100 million yuan, averaging about 16.6 million yuan per month. However, from January to March, expenditures exceeded income. Mr. Ding began to rectify the situation in June, with the principle of not increasing the burden on the people. The main method was to eliminate corruption so that every penny of tax revenue would go to the public. The original land tax, business tax, special tax, and consumption tax were reorganized separately without opening up new tax sources. The accounting system was strictly enforced, and a special accounting office was set up to strictly audit the accounts. A special consumption tax office was also set up to actively reorganize the consumption tax, and the consumption tax rates of various bureaus were increased in accordance with current prices. It is estimated that since implementation in July, the increase in revenue has been considerable. As for the collection of land tax, following the example of Jiangsu, counties with relatively convenient transportation and solid security, such as Hangzhou County and Jiaxing County, were selected to first collect the land tax in kind for the upper quarter of the 34th year. For the lower quarter of the 34th year, the financial bureaus of each county will be abolished, and land tax collection offices will be established in each county, with the county magistrate serving concurrently as the director, and a deputy director will be sent by the provincial government to supervise the collection work. If the collection of land tax in kind is effective, the problem of food rice for the military, police, and civil servants can be easily solved. All previous commission systems for various taxes have also been abolished, and public quotas have been strictly set. Standards have been established with reference to the local conditions and security of various cities and counties, as well as the strength of purchasing power, and reports are submitted quarterly. The grades of each bureau are re-determined, appropriate funding is provided, and regulations for rewards, penalties, and performance evaluations are revised. The tax revenue of each tax will inevitably increase further.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Improving Cultural and Educational Undertakings <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's cultural and educational undertakings have always been well-developed, but they have been greatly damaged since the Incident. Upon taking office, Mr. Ding first ordered that all cultural and educational personnel should be employed with the principle of employing people from this province, followed by increasing the salaries of educational personnel and raising educational funding. The salaries of teachers in Zhejiang Province are even more important than those of civil servants in terms of the teaching staff, and efforts are being made to improve them. Recently, the second general registration of primary school teachers in the province was held, and teacher training classes were planned to train current primary school teachers in rotation to develop educational talents. Furthermore, local educational administrative personnel are carefully selected, and the assessment of the education system is strict. Academic standards are also emphasized to curb students' bad habits. In order to strengthen and promote production education, vocational schools have added agricultural courses, and schools are required to use vacant land to grow miscellaneous grains to increase production, and small factories are planned to manufacture industrial products. Secondly, the level of Japanese teachers in Zhejiang Province varies, so a Japanese language cram school will be held during the summer vacation to provide further education. In terms of culture, in view of the fact that the books of the provincial library are scattered and have not been sorted out, a large sum of money has been allocated to order their reorganization in order to preserve the national essence. As for the museum, the alcohol used for the animal and plant specimens has not been replaced for a long time, and the specimens are about to rot. Appreciating the difficulty of the predecessors' collection, for the sake of preserving culture, they have been replaced separately. The library and museum have been renovated after reorganization. Furthermore, many famous historical sites have been damaged since the Incident, and a committee for the renovation of famous historical sites has been established, inviting local people to participate in the renovation and reorganization. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The municipal government yesterday formulated the Shanghai Special Municipal Government's Provisional Measures for Salary Rice Rationing, which was announced and implemented. At the same time, the previous Shanghai Special Municipal Administration for Allocation of Supplies's Measures for the Municipal Government and Affiliated Bureaus and Offices' Salary Rice Rationing, which was formulated by the former Administration for Allocation of Supplies, was abolished. The main points of the new measures are as follows:</p>
<p>The employees of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies, as well as the faculty and staff of municipal and county schools, will be temporarily allocated three dou of salary rice per person per month free of charge, which will be issued by the Bureau of Economy.</p>
<p>The amount of rice allocated to the police bureau, in addition to following the procedures stipulated in each article, is as follows: 1.

Unmarried police officers will be allocated two and a half dou of salary rice per month.</p>
<p>Police officers in the suburbs will be allocated three dou of salary rice per month. The aforementioned salary rice will be temporarily issued by the Bureau of Economy, and the rationing for county police officers will be stipulated separately.</p>
<p>The salary rice allocation for the security team is uniformly three dou for officers and soldiers. Those stationed in the urban area will collect it from the Bureau of Economy according to the prescribed procedures. Those stationed in the counties will be allocated by each county from the collected treasures according to regulations. If the treasures collected in each county are insufficient, a special report should be submitted to the municipal government for unified coordination.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The First Phase of Land Tax Collection in Kind is Quite Good: Rice and Wheat to be Shipped to Shanghai This Week <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Finance has already started the first phase of the work of collecting land tax in kind from its affiliated counties. Around the beginning of this month, the first batch of rice, grain, and wheat is expected to be transported to Shanghai. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Municipal Bureau of Finance's collection of land tax in kind this time has been quite successful. Even in this lean season, the actual amount received can roughly reach the budgeted figures. In the future, the salary rice and food rations for the municipal government and various bureaus and offices can be processed as usual. When the first batch of goods arrives in Shanghai, the Bureaus of Finance, Police, and Economy will jointly inspect and accept them, and the Bureau of Economy will be responsible for their storage. Subsequent batches will be shipped to Shanghai, and the procedures will remain the same. As for the first phase of the collection of land tax in kind, according to regulations, the deadline is the end of this month. If the land tax is not paid by the deadline, a late payment fine will be imposed in accordance with the regulations. It is heard that the second phase of the collection of land tax in kind for this year can also be started separately in October.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Mayor's Scholarship Examination Scheduled <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>In order to rescue outstanding poor students from dropping out of school, the Municipal Bureau of Education has set up the Mayor's Scholarship. Every year during the summer vacation, a public examination is held, and those who are admitted are sent to municipal middle schools to study. In addition to waiving all tuition fees, they are also subsidized for books, booklets, and supplies. Now, in view of the fact that tuition fees for private schools will increase in the next semester, and the number of students who are unable to afford education will inevitably increase, the bureau has increased the number of scholarships by 60 in order to support the Mayor's intention to help the poor and reward the outstanding. It is heard that the Municipal Xinzha Road Primary School and other 38 schools, as well as 123 registered private Yisheng Primary Schools and others, have been ordered to recommend outstanding students to take the examination. It is heard that the registration deadline is July 7, and the examination date is July 10. The registration and examination address is the Municipal Yucai Middle School at 445 Shanhaiguan Road.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Started on August 8, Designated as Father's Day <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Prominent figures from all walks of life in the city have recently proposed to designate August 8 as "Father's Day." Hundreds of people have signed up to support the proposal, and commemorative measures have been drawn up, which will be held separately on the designated date. It is recalled that when the First World War ended, Ms. Jarvis initiated "Mother's Day" to comfort the mothers of those who died in battle. Knowledgeable people from all countries actively promoted it, and "Mother's Day" is held every year, which is very grand. Now that the Second World War is over, all circles in the city have associated with this, and have jointly launched "Father's Day." The homophone of "August 8th Festival" is "Papa Festival," which is easy to remember in name and meaning. The commemorative ceremony will follow the precedent of Mother's Day.</p>
