<h3 id="c4">滬杭綫之首鎭—硤石 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 董長卿</p>
<p>硤石，位於嘉興西南五十里，爲海寗縣屬四大鎭之冠。於滬杭綫沿路各城鎭，可稱首鎭。本屬海寗縣第二區，戰後因海寗縣城遠僻，交通不便，故暫移治於此。縣政府，黨部，地方法院，保安隊部，縣商會等機關，均駐此鎭。最近人口，約十三萬餘，與戰前相等。治安有保安隊士兵一中隊，常川駐防，警察局警士及偵緝隊近百。外有友軍駐紮，故地方尚稱安寗。</p>
<p>工商概況</p>
<p>硤石因地扼滬杭交通之要衝，內地鄕館，也四通八達。物產出口，以米糧，菸葉，絲爲大宗，士布，羊毛等次之。皆集合硤石，遝銷滬杭，故商業極繁盛。較之長安，袁化，路仲各鎭，有　壤之別。</p>
<p>工商業戰前以針織業，土布業爲最盛，行銷滬杭平津各大都市。其次爲　絲業，棉織業。戰後因物資及運輸關係，一落千丈，幾乎停頓。</p>
<p>最近以捲烟業較活躍，烟店如雨後春筍，大小有三四十家，皆賴跑單帮者從滬杭運來，捲菸皂燭火柴等日用品，再行銷鄕鎭隣縣，如桐鄕，海鹽，海寗各縣所屬之鄉鎭。百貨業十餘，以大興恒範圍最大，滬杭綫各城鎭，均有聯號。米糧業三四十家，因有跑單帮者携帶，故也興盛，羣設米市街上。運輸業八九家，近因鐵路貨車運輸減少，而貨物化整為零，賴單帮負帶之故，日趨淸淡。有第一皂廠者，出品一等船牌等土製肥皂。行銷鄉鎭。鎭上各業，經營之形式，合股者居多數，獨資者少，而依持金融界之放　轉動，故經濟調度尚稱圓滑。金融界有中央儲備銀行辦事處，浙江省銀行分行，及杭州某銀行分行三家，錢莊則有十家之多。邇來物價高漲，購買力缺乏者居多，因之市而蕭條，各業開支浩大，捐稅繁重，而自動停業者不少。</p>
<p>昔日曾以燈綵馳名遐邇，近因戰後環境及財力，無此閒興矣。</p>
<p>公共事業</p>
<p>公益事業，因本鎭旣為縣治之地，故也恢復戰前情狀。敎育方面；有省立海寗中學，及省立海寗師範學校，小學有縣立小學六所，私立學塾多所。惟因經費不足，領導乏人，辦理不善，故成績平平。昔日硤石文風很盛，戰後因環境及財力，興辦不易，以致衰退，誠爲可惜。醫院有縣立海寗醫院及私人醫院多所，因距滬杭非遙，購置醫藥，較爲便利，故設備尚合人意。</p>
<p>原先本有硤石日報一份，館址在千河街，因經費不足，物資缺乏，已於去歲年底停刋，但經營書報者數家，故滬地各報及書籍，均能於當日運到。</p>
<p>消防設備，有公立消防處一所，設備有柴油帮浦六七座，外有各坊居民之議務消防隊，備有抽水洋龍十餘座。</p>
<p>商辦硤石電燈公司，成立於民二年，備有發電機二座，近因柴油缺乏，一改燃植物油，一改燒木柴。因之收費，也以每月之物價計算，近月爲每度一萬八千元，發電時間，自黃昏至十一時許。平民小戶，因電費過鉅，近也改點植物油燈矣。該公司附有電話，全鎭裝置者，有二百戶，論月收費。長途電話，則須嘉興轉接。</p>
<p>交通尚稱便利，陸路織道，往上海杭州，日各二班。水路四通八達，皆賴航船及快船。往桐鄉，海寗，袁化，沈蕩，路仲，嘉興，屠甸等城鎭，每日均有專班。</p>
<p>市容一斑</p>
<p>硤石鎭長約六里，中夾一市河，可通舟輯，兩岸為正街，東岸之街，爲河東街，大街，東南河等，西岸爲河西街，小街，西南河等，橫街則有千河街，倉基，橫埭，上東街，下東街等。東南市梢附有一小鎭名橫頭</p>
<p>硤石之街道，正街上商舖林立，攤販紛陳，房屋也整齊。街心舖以大石板，淸潔平坦，通行人力車，尚稱便利。尤其是平晨，四鄉來鎭之鄕民，賣買各物，摩肩接踵，擁擠異常。餘街則爲住宅或廠房，却也幽靜淸潔。水路船棹，絡繹不絕，載客裝貨，忙碌不已。</p>
<p>鎭民之娛樂，有硤石戲　一所，在干河街，時演京·杭·越·話劇，間映電影或雜要，日夜二塲。建築腐舊，設備簡陋，演員多江湖草臺班之角兒，技藝强差人意，但看白戲者很多。外有說書茶園多處，聽衆尚多。</p>
<p>菜館有鴻運樓·小有天·大加利三處，近因天氣炎熱，無冷氣設備，暫停營業，餘之則爲本地式之飯店十餘家，專售家常便飯，故營業尙好。浴室有一，陋　不堪，旅館十餘，以第一·榮發較佳。妓女·　導·台基·私娼均有。以杭州來者最多，滬地及本地籍者也有。均爲生活所迫，絕少佳麗。</p>
<p>名聲道古跡</p>
<p>硤石地當沈山（俗名東山）及紫微山（西山）之間，二山相峙，氣槪雄偉。舊志古稱夾谷，初本兩山相連，秦始皇東遊過此，以其山有王氣，發囚徒十萬　之，遂分爲二，一日東山，一日西山。今市河大虹橋下（俗名平橋）兩岸山根猶露，相傳爲　始皇　處，按此說不足信。兩山夾水爲峽，本作峽石，唐以後誤爲硤石。史稱越王勾踐，屯兵水口，即今硤石湖。</p>
<p>鎭有惠力寺，俗名西寺，內有回文壁，砌文如織，俗謂係魯班神跡，山門外幢石，有白居易題名，戒堂內有白居易像，惜寺近遭火焚，敗磚破瓦，荒蕪不堪。</p>
<p>智標塔高　東山巔，係東　高僧智標所建。惜近劃東山爲軍事區，不得登山高臨。</p>
<p>西山　有二茅亭，有一　汪故主席題快心亭，一有傅式說題字。登之近囑全鎭，屋字　　，人烟稠密。遠跳野景，　舍田疇，錯綜相間。設在月夜，皓月當空，山景倍明，萬籟俱寂，境極淸幽，令人心曠神怡，留戀忘返。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3 id="c5">日兩政治團體倂入政治會 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電大日本政治會，係日本全國戰時下之唯一民間政治團體，其他屬於衆議院分派之護國同志會，與翼壯議員同志會兩團體，由戰局之急轉及確立堅强國民總力決戰體制之要求，集合民間政治總力之時機，已臻成熟，頃日政幹部與護國同志會幹部進行交涉，南日政總裁，與井野護國同志會長，於七日會見，進行懇談之結果，對於合併二團體之意見，已獲一致。因之，南總裁乃於八日以談話之形式，發表聲明書，同時護國同志會亦於九日舉行臨時代議士會，決定解散，並議決全體會員加入日政會。又三浦一雄會長領導之翼壯議員同志會，亦將與日政會合併。</p>

<h3 id="c8">美總統特魯曼　接見史汀生　南原子炸彈事項　　里斯本九日中央社電　據華盛頓訊，美總統特魯曼自波次坦返歸華盛頓後，於其正式視事之第一日，急與陸長史汀生會談有關原子炸彈之各事項。史汀生向特魯曼總統詳細報吿飛機偵察日本廣島之結果，同時商討有關戰略上及物理上施用該項原子炸彈之事宜。英蘇駐軍　退出德黑蘭　　里斯本九日中央社電　伊期外交部昨日正式宣稱，波次坦會議中已決定將英。蘇兩國駐軍自德黑蘭撤退，此項決定已由英國駐德黑蘭外交當局轉知伊朗政府。按英軍已退出者爲步兵一師，印度將校醫院與德黑蘭附近之新建軍營，現伊朗政府亟盼一切聯合國方面之軍隊，均應速自伊朗國土退出。社評三論國民黨與憲政　　關於國民黨與民主憲政問題，我們曾因陳公博先生「國民黨的再檢討」一文，一再抒述所見，一面伸引公博先生珍貴的意見，另一方面就我們愛護國民黨尤其是愛護中華民國的忠忱，向國人有所商榷，但意猶未盡，特再申論之。　　公博先生在「國民黨組織的透視」一章，對於國民黨的組織，訓練及策略三者，作摯誠而坦白的批評。誠如公博先生自己所聲明，「我不是在今日憲政將要實施以前，要故意批評本黨，來討好黨外的人們，我是國民黨一個負責任者，惟其愛之也深，故言之也切」：我們雖然爲國民黨外的一般民衆立言，但是我們愛護國民黨的深切，自信也不亞於公博先生，而對於國民黨之健全進步的期待，也同樣的學誠。因此，我們對於國民黨今後的組織問題，竊願代表大多數民衆，獻其一得之愚。　　關於國民黨的組織，公博先生詳述其州有秘密化的必要，不過，在原則上我們還覺得政治鬥爭，無寗以公開方式更易與民衆接近而相互了解；然而，我們對公博光生關於黨公開之弊的指南，頗有同感。我們認為黨的公開，決不能成爲一種變相的衙門，變成民衆的統治者而不是民衆權利的保衛者，因爲這種結果，不但是黨和民衆疏遠的原因，而且也有如公博先生所說，易使黨員自以爲勝利了成功了，消失其鬥爭心向上心，間接也就容易使黨腐化和墮落。今後實施憲政，必須對此愼重考慮。　　公博先生對於國民黨的訓練和策略，有非常珍貴的指示，履行這些指示，實爲今後國民黨復興的基本條件。在訓練一方面，今日就全中國言，實在可憐得很，最近二十年來，國民黨究竟訓練出多少人才來，是一大疑問。無論在政治上軍事上經濟上乃至文化敎育宣傳方面，在革命建國的實際需要上，每一部門的最高領導者，都有人才難得之嘆。可是，另一方面，卻也有一些難得的人才，却由於人才政治的米克實現，更由於黨派系統的鬥爭，或是埋沒於市野，或更激使行險而爲異党所利用。所以我們希望國民黨方面，不僅對黨內切實訓練黨員，使成民衆的領導者；而且更須協助訓練及重用民間人才，準備將來憲政實施時出現人才政治。　　關於策略，就我們中國古來的政治哲學來看，是否认其價値的，孔孟以下的政治活動，都不主張運用什麼策略。不過，在今日複雜的國際形勢之下，在複雜的國內政局之下，應付政治工作，有時的確需要策略，不過策略不能濫用，濫用了策略，小之則有似公博先生所指出的，使執行第略的少數黨員陷於墮落腐敗，大之就有「資人以敵，以爲己害，更爲國殃」。所以我們認爲，黨的策略，必須以全國全民族的利益爲出發點，而不以一黨一派的利益爲目標；黨的策略之執行，必須由黨嚴密監督，不能憑少數個人任意去辦；策略的本身雖然要謀權變，但是其目標必須是光明正大，而可於事後公諸天下的；否則不論策略一時的成敗如何，對於黨及國家決無利益。日空軍襲沖繩　攻擊艦船羣　伊江島等處發生火災　　琉球羣島基地九日中央社電　日空軍於八日夜，對冲繩島方面敵軍機塲附近一帶之敵軍艦船羣加以攻擊，使伊江島上發生大火。又冲繩本島之中機塲亦有三處火災，此外日空軍復擊沉艦種不詳之敵艦三艘，重創其他艦船一艘。襲日各地敵機墜毀十二架　　東京九日中央社電　敵機動部隊於九日晨接近東北地方東方海面，自上午六時半許開始出動艦載機，對該地加以攻擊，迄上午八時左右，敵機來襲福島·宮崎·秋田·靑森·山形·新潟等地，共約六十架。　　東京九日中央社電　B29型機約六十五架，八日下午三時許分爲數編隊，來襲靜岡·八王子及東京東部地區，日軍制空部隊當起迎擊，迄下午五時止，經判明之戰果，計擊落敵機兩架，擊毀敵機十架。　　九州四國地區空襲　　東京九日中央社電　九日上午九時迄十二時之問，敵戰鬥轟炸機連合約三百架，由豐後水道北上，其主力進入西部軍管區，一部活動於伊豫灘廣島縣·山口縣，另有小型機數架於同時侵入島根縣內部。　　東京九日中央社電　B29型六十架，自四國東南端及阿波等地侵入，歷一小時之久，對福山附近以　夷彈攻擊。　　艦艇一部砲擊釜石　　東京九日中央社電　敵機動部隊起飛之艦載機三百架，九日上午六時左右，迄現在下午五時，來襲東北各地，主要攻擊飛機塲·軍需工塲。交通機關等。又敵艦艇一部，下午零時五十分砲擊釜石。日軍肉搏隊繼續猛攻　　南方前綫基地九日中央社電　峇厘巴板方面之敵軍，遭日軍肉搏隊之襲擊，傷亡慘重，自上月一日登陸後一月之間，已喪失其全軍之三成，戰意頹喪，一月內敵軍僅佔領該地街市地區一部及雪曼加爾斯比千兩機塲而已。敵雖於砲火掩護下，來攻三馬林達街道，然爲日軍堅陣所阻，難越雷池一步，日軍肉搏隊勇士正陸續猛攻中。英第九軍結束　　里斯本九日中央社電　據貝魯特發出消息，英國第九軍已正式結束，此後該軍將定名爲「里文達北達英國駐軍」，繼續歸曼斯將軍統領。何炳賢任軍會常委岑德逛任經理總監　　南京九日中央社電　國府令（三十四年八月九日），經理總監部總監何炳賢，呈請辭職，何炳賢准免本職，此令。特任岑德廣爲經理總監部總監，此令。軍委會常務委員陳公博呈請辭職，陳公博准予免職，此令。特任何炳賢爲軍事委員會常務委員，此令。　　南京九日中央社電　軍委會經理總監部總監兼中央軍校秘書長何炳賢，以時局日趨緊張，建軍工作實爲當務之急，中央軍校爲建軍之基礎，亦爲汪故主席所手創，何氏以經理總監部事務冗繁，鑒於時局之需要，毅然向陳代主席呈辭以理總監部總監職務，專任軍校秘書長，昨日國防會議，業經特任為軍委會常務委員。以便專心致力建軍工作，在陳代主席領導之下，完成汪故主席炎遺志。　　國防會議通過要案　　南京九日中央社電　最高國防會議九日開第七六次會議：報吿事項，宣讀第七五次會議記錄。討論事項，　主席交議，據行政院呈，木院第二六二次會議，通過財政部呈請修正財政部管理金融機關暫行辦法第十七，第十九兩條條文，擬具草案呈核一案，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，送國府公佈，並交立法院備查。　主席交議，軍委會常務委員陳公博呈，已繼任本會委員長，請辭常務委員職務，擬予照准，請公決案，決議通道，送國府。　主席交議，經理總監部總監何炳賢呈請辭職，擬予照准，請公決案，決議通過，送國府。　主席交議，擬特任何炳賢爲軍委會常務委員，請公決案’決議通過，送國府。　主席交議，擬特任岑德廣為經理總監部總監，請公決案，決議通過，送國府。　主席交議，據立法院呈，本院立法委員，尚有缺額，擬請以陳海超，朱孫番兩員充任本院立法委員，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，送國府。　主席交譏據監察院呈，本院監察委員李鼎士呈請辭職，擬予照准，遺缺請以許國鳳充任，呈情鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，送國府。　　四聯合國宣布統治奧地利　全國劃分四區　　瑞典京城九日中央社電　英外部昨夜對共同管理奥地利之政冶機構，發表英·美·蘇·法四國聯合布告，略謂：聯合國統治奥地利之政治機構，將包括聯合國統治會議，行政委員會及共他四大聯合國方面所委派之參謀本部，該項組織之整個定名為「奧地利聯合國統治委員會」，至於該聯合國統治委員會之基本任務爲　促使奥地利與德國分裂，　即刻建立一奧地利中央統治機構，　準備建立一奧地利自由選舉政府，　協助奧地利行政順利進行。至於聯合國統治會議，將包括四國軍思委員會，各該軍委會將共同對管理奥地利施以最高權力，在聯合國統治委員會之管理下，努力各施政工作之指導方針。關於將來之奧地利統治問題，待奧國中央統治機構成立後，即刻在聯合國統治委員會下實施各項行政工作，在聯合國會議之指揮下，各聯合國統治當局實施對維也納區全面管理，現四大聯合國已決定劃分整個奧地利為四大統治區，同時維也納城區內亦將被瓜分。美罷工潮蔓延　勞動界不安　戰後失業者將見激增　　東京九日中央社電　近來美國勞動戰綫異常不穩之勢，逐次波及美全國經濟界，因其戰意之停滯，罷工風潮業有蔓延全國之概。本年七月初，有工人十萬左右開始罷工，其大部多係俄亥俄州膠皮工廠等，直接影響戰爭之軍需工業，雖經美國軍部彈壓，尚復有繼續勃發之可能，而尤甚者，乃多數軍需工塲工人，開始向其他方面轉職，特別以最必需之船渠修造所工人為甚，此種傾向，使美軍當局異常煩惱，現罷工人數雖不多，然今後顯有增加之傾向，此種勞動不安現象，與美國產業紀律紊亂，業已暗示美國暗　情勢，此種罷工風潮，一面妨碍戰時產業有規律轉換和平產業，一面又引誘政府强制制定勞動法，以致更形助長勞動之不安，頓値我人重視。現美議會方面，業有剝奪羅斯福時代制定勞動者之特權，抑止勞動者之活動，哈琪巴頓波爾法案之提出，正表示美國勞動界之最大不安，因戰後將產生一千萬乃至一千八百萬名之失業者之問題。哥倫比亞大學敎授納伊亞預言稱，戰後美國將有一千萬名失業者產生，艾斯則斷定，一九四六年美國非拔術人員失業者約共一千一百萬，再加上技術人員失業者八百萬，則共達一千九百萬，此種產生量失業者之現象，乃屬必然。而美國之公會制度極紊亂，稍有不當，即會全體罷工，公會會員中不受公會指導及政府命令者，逐行增多，某工塲爲使自戰塲上歸還之勞動者復職，竟將參加第一次世界大戰之勞動者免職，因之全體工會乃起抗議，而至全體罷工。若公會方面應允此次罷工工人要求，不予歸還軍人而復職，則今日此多數新退伍軍人，亦將成爲失業，此實使美勞動界進退維谷，由是亦可深知美勞動戰綫之苦悶，與戰後美國經濟即將步入破產之狀態矣。 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>

<p>Soviet Union Announces State of War with Japan</p>
<p>Moscow, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – TASS announced late on the 8th that Foreign Minister Molotov met with Japanese Ambassador Sato on the night of the 8th and conveyed the following statement on behalf of the Soviet government to the Japanese government: After Germany's defeat and surrender, Japan remains the only major power insisting on continuing the war. On July 26th of this year, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing demanded Japan's unconditional surrender of its armed forces, which Japan rejected. The United Nations invited the Soviet government to participate in the war against Japan in order to end the war as soon as possible and reduce the number of casualties. The Soviet government, adhering to its obligations to the United Nations, agreed to the United Nations' proposal and joined the declaration of the Allied Powers on July 26th of this year. From the Soviet government's standpoint, this policy is to promote peace and rescue the people of all countries from future suffering and sacrifice. Furthermore, recognizing that this is the only way to save the Japanese people from the dangers and destruction they will face after their country rejects unconditional surrender, the Soviet government declares that from August 9th, the Soviet Union will be in a state of war with Japan. Foreign Minister Molotov conveyed the aforementioned facts to Ambassador Sato, and simultaneously instructed Soviet Ambassador to Tokyo, Malinov, to convey this declaration to the Japanese government. Ambassador Sato also agreed to convey this declaration to the Japanese government.</p>

<h3 id="e4">The First Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line—Xiashi <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>—Dong Changqing</p>
<p>Xiashi, located fifty li southwest of Jiaxing, is the leading of the four major towns under the jurisdiction of Haiyan County. Among the towns along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, it can be called the foremost town. It originally belonged to the Second District of Haiyan County, but after the war, due to the remoteness and inconvenient transportation of the Haiyan County seat, the county government temporarily moved its administration here. The county government, party headquarters, local court, security team headquarters, county chamber of commerce, and other organizations are all stationed in this town. The current population is approximately 130,000, the same as before the war. For security, there is a company of security team soldiers permanently stationed, along with nearly a hundred police officers and detectives from the police station. In addition, friendly forces are stationed nearby, so the local area is considered relatively peaceful.</p>
<p>Overview of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Xiashi is a crucial transportation hub on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, with inland country roads extending in all directions. The main exports are rice, tobacco, and silk, followed by homespun cloth and wool. These products are gathered in Xiashi and sold to Shanghai and Hangzhou, making commerce extremely prosperous, far exceeding that of other towns such as Chang'an, Yuanhua, and Luzhong.</p>
<p>Before the war, the most prosperous industries were knitting and homespun cloth weaving, which were sold in major cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin. The silk industry and cotton weaving were secondary. After the war, due to material and transportation constraints, these industries declined sharply, almost to a standstill.</p>
<p>Recently, the cigarette industry has been more active, with cigarette shops springing up like mushrooms after rain, numbering thirty to forty large and small. They rely on peddlers who transport cigarettes, soap, candles, matches, and other daily necessities from Shanghai and Hangzhou, and then sell them to villages and towns in neighboring counties, such as those belonging to Tongxiang, Haiyan, and Haining. There are over ten department stores, with Da Xing Heng being the largest in scale, having branches in various towns along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. There are thirty to forty rice shops, which are also thriving due to the help of peddlers and are concentrated on Rice Market Street. There are eight or nine transportation companies, but due to the recent reduction in railway freight transport and the tendency to break down goods into smaller units carried by peddlers, business has been declining. The First Soap Factory produces first-class "Ship Brand" and other domestically-made soaps, which are sold in villages and towns. Most businesses in the town are operated as partnerships, with few sole proprietorships, and they rely on financing from the financial sector, so their economic management is relatively smooth. The financial sector includes the Central Reserve Bank office, a branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, and a branch of a certain bank from Hangzhou, as well as over ten private banks. Recently, prices have risen sharply, and most people lack purchasing power, causing the market to be depressed. The expenses of various industries are high, taxes are heavy, and many businesses have voluntarily closed down.</p>
<p>In the past, it was famous for its lanterns and decorations, but due to the post-war environment and financial constraints, there is no longer the leisure for such things.</p>
<p>Public Utilities</p>
<p>Public welfare undertakings have been restored to their pre-war state because this town is the seat of the county government. In terms of education, there is the Provincial Haiyan High School and the Provincial Haiyan Normal School, along with six county-run primary schools and many private academies. However, due to insufficient funding and a lack of leadership, management is poor, and results are mediocre. Xiashi was once known for its strong literary culture, but after the war, due to environmental and financial constraints, it is difficult to develop, leading to its decline, which is truly regrettable. There are the county-run Haiyan Hospital and several private hospitals. Since it is not far from Shanghai and Hangzhou, the purchase of medicines is relatively convenient, so the facilities are reasonably satisfactory.</p>
<p>There was originally a Xiashi Daily newspaper, located on Qianhe Street, but due to insufficient funding and a lack of materials, it ceased publication at the end of last year. However, there are several shops that sell newspapers and books, so various Shanghai newspapers and books can be delivered on the same day.</p>
<p>For fire protection, there is a public fire department with six or seven diesel pumps, as well as volunteer fire brigades from various neighborhoods, equipped with over ten water pump hoses.</p>
<p>The commercially-run Xiashi Electric Light Company was established in 1913 and has two generators. Recently, due to a shortage of diesel, one has been converted to burn vegetable oil and the other to burn firewood. As a result, fees are calculated based on monthly prices, recently at 18,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Due to the high electricity costs, many ordinary households have switched to using vegetable oil lamps. The company also has a telephone service, with 200 households in the town having installed phones, charged on a monthly basis. Long-distance calls require transfer through Jiaxing.</p>
<p>Transportation is relatively convenient. There are two daily bus services to Shanghai and Hangzhou. Waterways extend in all directions, relying on boats and fast boats. There are daily services to towns such as Tongxiang, Haining, Yuanhua, Shendang, Luzhong, Jiaxing, and Tudian.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Cityscape</p>
<p>The town of Xiashi is about six li long, with a river running through the middle, navigable by boats. The streets on both sides are the main streets. The streets on the east bank are known as Hedong Street, Dajie, and Dongnanhe, while the streets on the west bank are known as Hexi Street, Xiaojie, and Xinanhe. The cross streets include Qianhe Street, Cangji, Hengdai, Shangdong Street, and Xiadong Street. The southeastern edge of the town is attached to a small town called Hengtou.</p>
<p>The streets of Xiashi have shops lining the main streets, with vendors scattered about, and the houses are orderly. The street centers are paved with large stone slabs, clean and flat, facilitating the passage of rickshaws. Especially in the early morning, villagers from the surrounding countryside come to the town to buy and sell goods, crowding together in an extraordinary manner. The remaining streets are residential areas or factories, which are quiet and clean. Boats are constantly coming and going along the waterways, busy loading and unloading passengers and goods.</p>
<p>For entertainment, there is a Xiashi Theater located on Ganhe Street, which sometimes puts on Beijing, Hangzhou, Yue, and spoken dramas, and occasionally shows movies or variety shows, with two shows a day and night. The building is dilapidated, the facilities are simple, and the actors are mostly amateur troupes from the countryside, with mediocre skills, but many people watch the shows for free. There are also several storytelling teahouses, with many listeners.</p>
<p>There are three restaurants: Hongyunlou, Xiaoyoutian, and Dajiali. Due to the hot weather, with no air conditioning, they are temporarily closed. The remaining dozen or so local-style restaurants specialize in home-style meals, so business is still good. There is one bathhouse, which is dilapidated, and over ten hotels, with the First and Rongfa hotels being the better ones. There are prostitutes, female escorts, platform girls, and private prostitutes. Most are from Hangzhou, with some from Shanghai and local. They are all driven by the necessities of life, and few are beautiful.</p>
<p>Famous Scenic Spots and Historical Sites</p>
<p>Xiashi is located between Shen Mountain (commonly known as East Mountain) and Ziwei Mountain (West Mountain). The two mountains face each other, their appearance majestic. Old records refer to it as Jiagu, originally two mountains connected. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang toured the east, he believed that the mountain possessed royal energy, so he sent 100,000 prisoners to split it into two, one being East Mountain and the other West Mountain. The mountain roots on both sides of the Great Rainbow Bridge (commonly known as Pingqiao) under the city river are still exposed, said to be the place where Qin Shi Huang excavated, but this claim is not credible. The gap between the two mountains with water flowing through is called a gorge, originally written as "峽石" (gorge stone), but it was mistakenly written as "硤石" (narrow stone) after the Tang Dynasty. Historical records state that King Goujian of Yue stationed troops at Shuikou, which is now Xiashi Lake.</p>
<p>The town has Huili Temple, commonly known as the West Temple, which contains a palindrome wall with writing arranged like weaving, said to be a miraculous work of Lu Ban. Outside the mountain gate are stone pillars with inscriptions by Bai Juyi, and inside the precept hall is a statue of Bai Juyi. Unfortunately, the temple was recently burned down, leaving broken bricks and tiles in a desolate state.</p>
<p>The Zhibiao Pagoda stands tall on the peak of East Mountain, built by the eminent monk Zhibiao of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Unfortunately, East Mountain has recently been designated as a military zone, making it impossible to climb and enjoy the view.</p>
<p>There is the Er Mao Pavilion on West Mountain, with inscriptions by former Chairman Wang in one, and calligraphy by Fu Shi in the other. From here, one can get a close view of the entire town, with its roofs closely packed together and dense population. In the distance, one can see the rural scenery, with houses and fields interspersed. Especially on moonlit nights, with the bright moon shining in the sky, the mountain scenery is even more clear. All sounds are silent, creating an extremely serene atmosphere that makes people feel refreshed and reluctant to leave. (Transferred to help education)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Two Japanese Political Groups Merge into the Political Association <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Greater Japan Political Association is the only civilian political organization in Japan during wartime. The two other groups belonging to the House of Representatives, the Patriotic Comrades Association and the Yokusangikai Comrades Association, have reached a point where the urgent shift in the war situation and the demands of establishing a strong national power for decisive battles require the pooling of civilian political power. Recently, senior officials of the Political Association and the Patriotic Comrades Association engaged in negotiations. The President of the Political Association, Nan, and the President of the Patriotic Comrades Association, Ino, met on the 7th and, as a result of their sincere discussion, reached a consensus on merging the two groups. Therefore, President Nan issued a statement in the form of a conversation on the 8th. Simultaneously, the Patriotic Comrades Association held a special delegates meeting on the 9th to decide on dissolution and resolved that all members join the Political Association. In addition, the Yokusangikai Comrades Association, led by President Miura Kazuo, will also merge with the Political Association.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Editorial: A Third Discussion on the Kuomintang and Constitutionalism <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Kuomintang (KMT) and democratic constitutionalism, we have repeatedly expressed our views based on Mr. Chen Gongbo's article, "A Re-examination of the Kuomintang," extending Mr. Gongbo's valuable opinions and, out of loyalty to the KMT and especially to the Republic of China, engaging in discussions with the nation. However, feeling that we have not fully expressed our thoughts, we present a further discussion.</p>
<p>In the chapter "An Analysis of the Kuomintang's Organization," Mr. Gongbo offers sincere and candid criticisms of the KMT's organization, training, and strategies. As Mr. Gongbo himself stated, "I am not intentionally criticizing the Party today, on the eve of the implementation of constitutionalism, to please those outside the Party. As a responsible member of the Kuomintang, I speak so earnestly precisely because I love it so deeply." Although we speak on behalf of the general public outside the KMT, we believe that our deep concern for the KMT is no less than that of Mr. Gongbo, and we share the same sincere expectation for the KMT's healthy progress. Therefore, regarding the KMT's organizational issues moving forward, we humbly wish to offer our humble suggestions on behalf of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>Regarding the KMT's organization, Mr. Gongbo details the necessity of keeping certain matters confidential. However, in principle, we still believe that political struggles are better conducted openly to facilitate closer interaction and understanding with the public. Nevertheless, we largely agree with Mr. Gongbo's guidance on the drawbacks of the Party being too open. We believe that the Party's openness must not become a disguised government office, turning into a ruler of the people rather than a protector of the people's rights. Such a result would not only alienate the Party from the people but also, as Mr. Gongbo said, easily lead Party members to become complacent, lose their fighting spirit and ambition, and indirectly lead to the Party's corruption and decline. This requires careful consideration as constitutionalism is implemented in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Gongbo provides very valuable instructions regarding the KMT's training and strategies. Implementing these instructions is a fundamental condition for the KMT's future revival. In terms of training, the situation in China today is truly pathetic. It is a major question how many talented individuals the KMT has trained in the past twenty years. Whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or even culture, education, and propaganda, there is a lamentable shortage of talent among the top leaders in every sector in terms of the practical needs of revolution and national construction. However, on the other hand, there are indeed some rare talents, but due to the lack of talent-based politics and the struggles between party factions, they are either buried in obscurity or driven to take risks and be exploited by rival parties. Therefore, we hope that the KMT will not only thoroughly train its members within the Party, making them leaders of the people, but also assist in training and re-employing civilian talents to prepare for the emergence of talent-based politics when constitutionalism is implemented in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding strategies, from the perspective of ancient Chinese political philosophy, their value is denied. The political activities of Confucius, Mencius and those after them did not advocate the use of any strategies. However, in today's complex international situation and complex domestic political situation, dealing with political work does sometimes require strategies. However, strategies cannot be abused. Abusing strategies can, on a small scale, lead to the corruption and decline of the few party members who implement the strategies, as Mr. Gongbo pointed out, and on a large scale, can "provide resources to the enemy, harming oneself and endangering the country." Therefore, we believe that the Party's strategies must be based on the interests of the entire nation and the entire people, and not on the interests of a single party or faction. The implementation of the Party's strategies must be strictly supervised by the Party and cannot be left to the arbitrary decisions of a few individuals. While the strategies themselves must be flexible, their goals must be open, just, and can be made public afterwards. Otherwise, regardless of the temporary success or failure of the strategies, they will not benefit the Party or the country.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - The British Foreign Office last night issued a joint proclamation by the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France on the political organization for the joint administration of Austria, stating in brief: The political organization for the Allied administration of Austria will include the Allied Council, the Executive Committee, and other general staff appointed by the four major Allied powers. The entire organization will be named the "Allied Council for Austria." The basic tasks of the Allied Council are: 1. To separate Austria from Germany. 2. To immediately establish a central Austrian governing body. 3. To prepare for the establishment of a free and democratically elected Austrian government. 4. To assist in the smooth conduct of Austrian administration. The Allied Council will include the military committees of the four countries, each of which will jointly exercise supreme power over the administration of Austria, striving to guide all administrative work under the management of the Allied Council. Regarding the future governance of Austria, once the central Austrian governing body is established, all administrative work will be immediately implemented under the Allied Council, and the Allied authorities will implement comprehensive management of the Vienna district under the direction of the Allied Council. The four major Allied powers have now decided to divide the entire Austria into four administrative zones, and the Vienna city area will also be divided.</p>
<h3 id="e20">U.S. Strike Wave Spreads; Labor Unrest; Post-War Unemployment Expected to Surge <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The recent abnormal instability in the U.S. labor front has gradually affected the entire U.S. economy. Due to the stagnation of its war spirit, strike waves have spread throughout the country. At the beginning of July this year, about 100,000 workers began strikes, most of which were in rubber factories in Ohio, directly affecting war-related military industries. Although the U.S. military has suppressed them, there is still a possibility of continued outbreaks. Even more seriously, many workers in military industries have begun to switch to other fields, especially workers in the most essential dockyard repair shops. This tendency is causing great distress to the U.S. military authorities. Although the number of strikers is not large now, there is a clear trend of increasing in the future. This labor unrest and the disorder of U.S. industrial discipline have already hinted at the U.S. situation. This strike wave, on the one hand, hinders the orderly conversion of wartime industries to peaceful industries, and on the other hand, it induces the government to forcibly enact labor laws, which further fuels labor unrest, which is something we should pay attention to. Currently, the U.S. Congress is considering the Hatch-Burton-Ball Act, which would deprive laborers of the special privileges they gained during the Roosevelt era and suppress labor activities, indicating the greatest anxiety in the U.S. labor sector because of the problem of 10 million to 18 million unemployed people after the war. Columbia University Professor Naville predicted that the U.S. will have 10 million unemployed after the war, while Ellis determined that in 1946, the U.S. will have about 11 million unemployed non-skilled workers, plus 8 million unemployed skilled workers, for a total of 19 million. The phenomenon of this quantity of unemployed people is inevitable. The U.S.'s union system is extremely chaotic, and the slightest impropriety can lead to a full strike. The number of union members who do not follow union guidance and government orders is increasing. One factory, in order to re-employ laborers returning from the battlefield, dismissed laborers who participated in World War I, causing the entire union to protest and ultimately strike. If the union agrees to the demands of the current striking workers and does not re-employ returning soldiers, then the majority of these newly discharged veterans will also become unemployed. This truly puts the U.S. labor sector in a dilemma. From this, we can deeply understand the distress of the U.S. labor front and the fact that the U.S. economy is about to enter a state of bankruptcy after the war.</p>

<p>Since the Soviet Union has declared war on Japan, the Japanese and Soviet armies have entered a state of combat. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation yesterday, expressing the belief that the Japanese army in Shanghai is determined to ensure the security of the area in light of the changing situation. Anyone who disturbs the peace will be punished by military law without exception. The proclamation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese General Headquarters announced on August 9th that the Soviet Union has entered a state of war with Japan and issued a battle report stating that a portion of the Soviet army has crossed the Soviet-Manchurian border and begun attacks. The Japanese and Manchurian armies in various locations have begun to counterattack for self-defense. Due to this fact, the Greater East Asia War has become increasingly complex and severe. However, the Japanese army in the area, considering the changing situation and preparing countermeasures without regret, will not be shaken by this situation and is determined to complete the Greater East Asia War. With the view of seeking China's unity and revitalization, the Japanese army will cooperate with the Chinese government, army, and people to complete the important task of ensuring local security. It is hoped that the Chinese officials and people in the area, as well as the overseas residents in Shanghai, will trust the Japanese army, closely cooperate, and cope with this changing situation. Please do not easily believe rumors and cause unrest and instability, and cooperate in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Furthermore, if the following actions are taken to hinder the Japanese army's security and defense, the Japanese army will severely punish them according to military law:</p>
<p>*   Those who make destabilizing remarks and spread rumors.</p>
<p>*   Those who engage in activities that disrupt the economy.</p>
<p>*   Those who engage in activities that aid the enemy and benefit the enemy.</p>

<p>According to reports from Moscow and other overseas sources, the Soviet government announced that it had entered a state of war with Japan on August 9th. The Japanese General Headquarters also announced that the Soviet army had begun cross-border attacks on the Soviet-Manchurian border and was currently engaged in battle with the Japanese and Manchurian armies. All compatriots residing in the area must be aware that the Greater East Asia War has become even more severe. At this juncture, you should deeply understand the government's policies, abide by your duties, remain calm and collected, and not be shaken in the slightest. You should uphold the Imperial Rescript and advance in your respective fields to achieve the noble goals of the war. At the same time, with the overseas Chinese compatriots' position in mind, you should uphold the spirit of the new China policy, further implement morality, and demonstrate the effect of good neighborliness and amity. This is what is earnestly hoped for.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the 20th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, following precedent, expanded its publicity of the meaning of air defense and implemented various air defense drills. The entire city entered a state of air defense, and the atmosphere was very tense. The details of each item are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e25">Police and Security Mobilization <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>This air defense drill focused on comprehensive training at each air defense district as a unit. All police and security personnel were fully mobilized, and various comprehensive trainings were implemented under the command of the branch chiefs at designated locations and times. In the evening, strict lighting control was implemented. Inspection teams and guidance teams composed of military police and Baojia personnel inspected all districts, streets, lanes, and alleys in the city and provided guidance and correction for those with poor lighting control. Violators were punished according to the rules, and a joint liability system was adopted, with even one Bao or even one Lianbao being subject to power outages. Vehicles with poor lighting were also subject to penalties, and both the person and the bureau were punished. In addition, the special protection corps of various factories and buildings also implemented various comprehensive air defense trainings under the guidance of personnel dispatched by the Air Defense Headquarters and the respective branch offices.</p>
<h3 id="e26">District Exercises <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Under the guidance of the Air Defense Headquarters, comprehensive training was conducted in northern Sichuan, mobilizing all personnel from the fire department, rescue team, police headquarters' fourth team, White Russian air defense squad, etc. The policemen of the Hongkou branch office, members of the Chinese and Japanese self-defense corps of the naval garrison area, and work crews from the electric company, water company, telephone company, and gas company also participated in the training. First, a simulated enemy air raid was carried out to implement shelter training. At the same time, it was simulated that water, electricity, telephone, and gas were damaged, and work crews from each company were dispatched to repair them. Police and security personnel arrived at the scene to rescue, the White Russian air defense squad sought the remains from the bricks, and police officers prepared to collect corpses and set up a shelter to accommodate the families of the dead and wounded.</p>
<p>The old district held a large-scale comprehensive training at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Liuhe Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The Huashan district implemented a large-scale training at the intersection of Singapore Road and Kangding Road at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, with all police and security personnel participating.</p>
<p>Each branch office organized a police bicycle relay team to maintain close contact with the General Bureau (Air Defense Section) to relay alarms and police orders. Each air defense district organized a Baojia self-defense corps bicycle relay team to maintain close contact with each branch office to relay alarms and police orders, so that alarms or police orders could be transmitted to all districts in the city in the fastest time possible, and the results were good.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Money Shops Raise Interest Rates <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain business operations, the banks and money shops in the city have successively raised the interest rates for various legal mortgage loans to 2.4 to 3%. Interest rates on loans related to industrial and commercial production have been reduced to 1.8%, and the highest rate must not exceed 2%. As for secret interest rates of 4 to 5% or more, this is sufficient to disrupt the financial system and encourage speculative activities. The relevant financial authorities have already paid close attention to this and are determined to crack down on it.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Free Admission for Children of Postal Workers <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Postal Administration believes that postal workers serve the country and live a hard life. It sent a letter to the Education Bureau requesting that the children of postal workers be given free preferential treatment for admission to schools, in accordance with the measures for the children of civil servants. The Education Bureau immediately forwarded the request to the Municipal Government, and it is reported that it has been approved.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Police Crackdown on Unauthorized Private Transportation of Cash; Amounts Under 1 Million Yuan Can Be Freely Carried <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government authorities, after checking the provisions of Article 2 of the Regulations on the Transportation of Cash, determined that it had been revised by the Ministry of Finance: "Anyone transporting legal tender from the interior to Shanghai or transporting legal tender to and from domestic ports in amounts exceeding 1 million yuan should submit the type, amount, purpose, number of boxes loaded, and place of departure to the Ministry of Finance for approval and issuance of a passport before transportation can begin. If transportation begins without a permit and is seized by the customs, it should be confiscated in its entirety." The Ministry of Finance requested cooperation in cracking down on unauthorized and illegal transportation and ordered the police department to instruct the duty police at the North and South stations and wharves to strictly crack down on passengers carrying more than 1 million yuan in cash without a passport from the Ministry of Finance (amounts under 1 million yuan can be freely carried) or carrying cash in excess of the amount stated on the passport. However, it was found that many passengers on public buses traveling on highways also had private cash with them, and they should also be inspected and cracked down on. Therefore, Mayor Zhou, concurrently the head of the police department, reiterated the previous order and instructed each branch office to send additional police officers to strictly inspect and crack down on public buses traveling on highways to enforce the law.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Central China Revitalization Company Donates to Disaster Relief <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Japanese people in Shanghai are extremely concerned about the victims of air raids. Under the leadership of President Takashima and Vice President Tomono of the Central China Revitalization Company, the company, together with its affiliated companies, decided to jointly donate 20 million yuan, of which 10 million yuan will be used by the company to purchase affordable medical supplies, which will be delivered to the Municipal Welfare Association together with the cash of 10 million yuan within a few days for disaster relief. The president said that in the future, the company can provide a special and full supply of water, electricity, and gas to all hospitals and emergency organizations as needed for disaster relief, without being subject to general restrictions. At the same time, the company plans to provide all transportation vehicles owned by its affiliated companies for air raid relief as possible when necessary. In addition, important Japanese business leaders, such as Mr. Kawamura, the branch manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank, are also scheduled to gather today to discuss fundraising methods for air raid relief, and a large sum of money will be donated within a few days for relief purposes. In addition, the Japanese Dobun Shoin donated 10 million yuan, and all teachers and students of the college also jointly donated 141,000 yuan. Yesterday, they entrusted Mr. Chen Shaoyi to transfer them to the News Daily Social Service Department.</p>

<p>Hope that Students from all Schools will Quickly Register</p>
<p>The Reader Assistance Fund Office of this newspaper recently sent letters to the principals of universities, colleges, and high schools, asking them to select students to implement work-study during the summer vacation and promote the book "Family Doctor." All students from universities, colleges, and high schools can apply for registration, receive "Family Doctor," and sell it to people from all walks of life. For every donation of 5,000 yuan, a copy will be given as a gift, of which 2,500 yuan will be given to the student promoter as a living allowance, and the remaining 2,500 yuan will be paid to Shenbao as a scholarship fund and a work-study loan for men and women. For example, if each student can sell 50 copies, they can earn a personal allowance of 125,000 yuan, which is a small supplement to the lives of ordinary poor students, and the scholarship recipients of this newspaper will also benefit greatly. It is hoped that students from all schools can actively apply to solve their own problems with their own strength and complete the goal of self-help and helping others. Students who wish to apply should ask this newspaper or the men's and women's youth association inquiry office for an application form. Recipients of this newspaper's scholarship can waive the application form and go directly to this newspaper's "Family Doctor" educational assistance campaign office with their student ID to receive the book. The closing date is not far off, and it is hoped that students from all schools will participate in time and work together to promote it. This is our hope.</p>
