<p>日航空隊潛水隊最近三周來戰果</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電日大本營六月一日下午三時三十分發表：　航空部隊及潛水部隊，其後繼續冒惡劣天氣，對冲繩本島及伊江島之敵航空基地及本島周邊之敵艦船並機動部隊攻擊，五月十一日以後，日方所得戰果中，截至現在業經查明者如次：擊沉巡洋艦六艘，驅逐艦三艘，運輸艦五艘，艦型不詳者七艘。擊毀及起火特設航空母艦二艘，戰艦或巡洋艦三艘，巡洋艦四艘，　逐艦四艘，輸送艦六艘，艦型不詳者十一艘。飛機塲炸毀燃燒者四十六處以上。以上戰果大半爲特別攻擊隊所　者。　冲繩本島南部地區日軍部隊，其後對向與那原南方地區及首里·那　之綫遂次侵入之敵軍明戰敢門中。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電冲繩陸上之戰鬥，以那覇。首里兩市之決戰爲中心，日趨激烈，敵倚賴其豐富之火器，企圖向前推進，自二十九日至二十日，終於突入那　市東北地區，日軍換一部陳地，奮力反擊。同時，堅守市內之防衛部隊，據守砲火中之市街，繼續與敵接戰。又首里市方面，敵不僅於正面進攻，日由東南方及南方城市壓迫，但日軍於城壁附近將其擊退，阻止敵之攻擊，而展開爭奪戰。</p>

<p>西南太平洋基地一日中央社電　敵於四月二十七日以巡洋艦五艘，　逐艦·掃海艇等十餘艘，企圖在泰拉千島登陸，日守備部隊早將長期持久之戰略準備完善，靜待消耗敵兵。五月一日　　，敵開始於林加斯海岸登陸時，日方業將敵可利用之重要設施完全破壞，日僑民亦不分老幼參加作戰。敵登陸之初，致力於飛機場·油田地帶·凈水池一帶之攻擊，然敵方戰意極不振作，其攻擊主力之飛機勢力，更爲頹萎，　問以少數飛機協力陸上作戰及切斷日軍之補給綫，並運人工作機械及技術人員，但隨機應變出奇制勝之日軍突擊隊，盡夜妨害其復與工作，故敵之　　意達二千餘名。自十六日以來，敵乃舉其全力開始攻擊，但日方精銳部隊亦頑强反攻，二十一·二兩日，實行壯烈之夜襲，阻止敵之前進。二十七日以來，更擴大突擊規範，熾烈戰鬥，自此總攻擊開始二周以來，雙方始終於最近距離互相對峙，刻正展開寸土必爭之熾烈戰鬥中。</p>

<p>中央社訊　據美聯社漢彌登法　自英戰艦喬治五世號上之報告：英太平洋艦隊副司令官官伯納德，洛林斯中將，曾就太平洋戰况報告稱，日本神風攻擊隊，使我人艦隊防空作戰方法，不得不作若干變更。神鳳攻擊隊，其命中率隊其他飛機爲高，我人欲與神風攻擊隊交機，設非發明新兵器，現行兵器實有加强其有效使用之必要。余以爲新兵器之發明，非一朝一夕所能辦到，爲今之計，惟有加强現有兵器之有效使用，其方法之一，當爲多用戰鬥機及轟炸機，充空中巡邏之用，於日特攻機未達目標之前，將其擊退。</p>
<h3 id="c5">敵大型艦船　數量激减 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>前綫基地一日中央社電　日航空部隊及特功隊，呼應五月二十四日義烈空挺部隊之壯舉，轉換，對於遊弋於冲繩島周圍之敵艦船隊·予以極大損害，因此敵艦數激減。二十九日下午三時迄今，於本島四周之敵艦船狀况，計在嘉手納洋面者，爲大型·中型運輸船三十五艘，慶良間列烏方面者，有航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘及其他九十四·五艘，於系滿洋面者，有大中小等型艦船十二艘左右，至於中城灣。凑川方面，因氣候不良，故米能確認，由此可見敵艦船所蒙損耗甚大。按日軍於開始攻勢前，五月二十三日，僅嘉手納洋面者亦有敵戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等十九艘遊弋中，以此對照，則現在敵艦船殆不及半數，尤以大型艦船羣之激減，足說日特攻隊攻擊之準確。</p>

<p>里斯本一日中央社電　因最近美國對日空襲日趨激烈，美國國內隊有僅賴空襲即能屈服日本之幾觀論，美軍當局亦有助長此種空氣之傾徇。紐約時報曾於二十八日社評巾發表警告如次：雖今後對日空襲如何節烈，亦不能僅以空襲而可使日本受無條件屈服之大損害，日本現僅喪失佔領地域七分之一，若日本與南方之速絡被杜絕，但仍有以日本本土，朝鮮，滿洲，華北形成之日本內錢圈，可以繼續作戰，且日本國民較德國國民更爲頑强，堅持不屈之信念，對日戰爭爲最困難之戰鬥，原因在於此</p>

<p>里斯本一日巾央社電英國泰晤士報二十五日揭載：美戰時動員局長威爾遜提交特魯曼之報告，該報告中曾述及美國完成對日戰爭之決意，殊堪注目。按美國現在擁有陸軍八百三十萬名，即歐戰告終後之一年內，亦計劃於歐洲保持六百九十萬兵力，然爲集巾總力於對日作戰之海軍，預算截止六月三十日止，可使總兵力擴充達三百三十八萬五千名，而現在之海軍部隊·計僅有四十七萬八千名而已。</p>

<p>東京一日中央社電　敵軍開始侵攻冲繩以來，已閱兩月，於此期中，日特攻隊曾予敵以擊沉毀總計六百餘艘之重創，對於此損害，敵軍協力謀掩蔽其國內之耳目，然日特攻機之猛攻日趨激烈，敵之損害，亦隨之積極增加。美海長福萊斯特三十日接見新聞記者時，曾言美太平洋沿岸造船廠修理能力極爲不足。路透社華盛頓電亦稱，現在之造船能力，尚不足修理由太平洋送回之受傷艦船，美海軍當局以及前綫報道，亦屢次提出該項問題。至袋近敵又自豪而謂，已樹立預防特攻攻擊么方策如次：　澈底擊減日本特攻隊基地，　加强艦船之防空砲火，由其恐懼之表現，即可證日特攻之威力矣。總之。日特攻機繼續不斷之猛攻，業使敵出血甚夥，其中尤有興趣者，乃英國欲於戰后屢得關於太平洋問題之發言勸，於是，乃　以有力艦隊參加冲繩作戰，　其喬五世號與其他正規空母以及戰門艦艇被擊沉毀後，其殘餘艦隊又皆脫離冲繩海面，而期　此加重美國之但負，保全自己艦隊實力，因此美陣營內之痛苦亦隨之逐漸加深。</p>

<h3 id="c16">急救民食的對策 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>民食問題的嚴重性，日見增加，而其他物價亦隨米價而波動，人民生活益感困苦。這次以米糧爲中心的物價狂漲浪潮，決不是簡單的經濟問題。雖然米價暴漲，起因於四鄉米價的先漲，而四鄉米糧暴漲的原因何在，非由中日雙方有關當局認眞檢討，善謀對策，則無法解救目前的困厄。因此，我們始終認定，只有中日雙方負責去檢討，誠心誠意的協力，才能使中國和平區今日的民食問題獲得解決。</p>
<p>試觀三天以來的黑市米價，由二十大關，直薄四十大關，這種狂暴的騰漲，除了直接威脅數百萬市民的生活以外，更刺激其他物價，而有使整惆社會陷入混亂的傾向。現在一般人誰不感到生活的恐慌，而懷着徬徨與怨尤。因此，爲挽救人心恐慌，希望當局迅速籌商切實對業，爰就管見，獻議如次：</p>
<p>第一，去年及木年初，本市米糧均會發生恐慌，當時迭承盟邦軍事當局，撥借米糧，臨時配給及平價出糶，得以平息。目前仍應由市府當局向盟邦關係方面商借米糧，臨時配給，酊給價格自可合理提高。我們相信盟邦關係當局素極關心中國民食問題，必能予以贊助。</p>
<p>第二，目前是在決戰時期，膳食目的僅以果腹爲止，決不能滿足口腹之慾。因此，一般食料，母須集注於自米一項，大可搭用雜糧。我們前曾建議，淮海省盛產雜糧，必有餘額供給，希望市府從速與淮悔省當局商洽採購，運滬酊給。</p>
<p>第三，規定每戶存糧最高數額，超過規定額者，予以限價收買，平價發售。</p>
<p>第四，限制囤積雜糧，嚴禁雜糧抬價，囤積雜糧，即予限價收買。如最近某統制會某委員，聞曾大事囤積雜糧，獲利二十萬萬以上，希望檢舉嚴懲。</p>
<p>第五，生活費用如此激增，升斗小民如此痛苦，而尚有一部分特殊階級，依然大張筵宴，奢侈糜費，實爲目前時局下不應有之畸形現象，希望各界自肅當局限制，以資節約。</p>
<p>以上所述，僅爲治標辦法。然而，糧食問題的根本解決辦法，必有賴於中日雙方的相互協力。希望中日常局澈底商討，以適合中國國情民情爲原則，以簡單迅捷爲目標，改善統制辦法，從速實施。時機急迫，刻不容緩，願關係方面亟起圖之。</p>

<p>對馬海峽的戰史</p>
<p>據本人所知道的·日本已有二次在對馬海峽迎取國難了。第一次是一二六八年與一二八一年的蒙古軍的兩次入冠。當時執黨日本政治的實權的，是叫做北條時宗的靑年武人，他斬殺了以日本爲東海　爾小國而來說降的蒙古使者，毅然邀擊蒙古的大軍於對馬海峽，把蒙古的十萬大軍，和　　巨船，一齊送入海底。當時的蒙古帝國，乃是併吞亞歐二洲的，歷史上來之前有的，廣大而且强有力的帝國，那是歷史家所極熟識的；可是連這龐大的蒙古帝國，終於也不能蹂躪神州日本。第二次便是挨里歐所指稱的，一九〇五年的波羅的海艦隊的桃戰，乘風波浪歷二萬英里之遙東來的帝俄的艦隊，在這海峽上覆減，卒至促使帝俄滅亡而新的蘇聯誕生。等三次便是這一次了。</p>
<p>美方工報絕不準確</p>
<p>挨里歐少校，就美國空軍在對馬海峽活動所得的效果，極抽象的叙述了后，又大　的預言日本軍將在對馬海峽敗北，但這不過是挨里歐式的論理，使本人不禁微笑起來。推想起來，挨里歐少校，大槪犯上一個難於避免的布幸的錯誤。那就是：挨里斯少校的理論所根據的資料，都是來自美國陸海軍部核尼米資，麥克沃衆的兩份公報吧，然而這四種正式發表是怎樣的充滿着虛偽與斯瞞，乃是世界各國所供知的實施。只要想一想珍珠灣當時，美國是怎樣發表它的損失，就不難明瞭了。美艦艇一千四百雙來發冲繩四周，但其戰力的八成　擊碎了，就是在此時此刻，美軍的戰力也一刻一刻的在低降下去，到一九四五年五月二十九日的此際，已經沒有一雙航空母艦在冲繩四周了，那知福勒斯塔却老着面皮，偽稱還保有航空母艦九十二隻。根據不確實的資料來判斷情勢，會招來多麼可怕的誤斷，挨里歐少校便是個好榜樣。</p>
<p>挨里歐少校力言日本艦隊必頻堂而皇之的戰勝英美的艦隊，然而現實所告訴我們的，日本不是已經在節節勝利了嗎？日本空挺隊，五月二十四日夜，奪取了冲繩兩個飛機塲，杜絕美空軍的活動，特攻隊在不斷的沉毀其艦船羣，並且大量生產也可稱爲母子飛機的新武器「人之炸彈」，命中目標，極爲準確。由人來駕駛和澡縱炸彈，直向目標飛進。這樣壯烈的偉舉，誰想得到能够實現呢？</p>
<p>美國戰力刻刻降低</p>
<p>以決戰場冲繩爲中心，美國的戰力，正一刻一刻在降低。其艦船被完全送入海底，或狼狽　逃之時，太平洋戰爭的大勢，就決定了。希望身爲美國陸軍少校兼軍事評論家的挨里歐氏，仔細熱察目前在冲繩展開着的，日本方面的立體攻擊之中，有着怎樣的戰略要素，並且對於戰局的展望，不要錯打算盤。第三次的對馬海峽戰役，機會行將到臨了。本人對挨里斯少校，表示很深的敬意。</p>

<p>廣州一日中央社電　據三十一日軍慶廣播：渝六中全會三十一日開第三次大會，決定更迭行政院正副院長，行政院長蔣介石·副院長孔祥熙均辭職，其後任院長爲宋子文。副院長爲翁又灝，業已正式任命。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據倫教廣播：路透社軍事記者約翰金契，就蔣介石之將行政院長一席讓與宋子文事，發表觀察如下：蔣介石已辭去行政院長一職，然重慶政權之外面機構，並不因此而有實質之變化，此次渝府改組，規模雖小’令人感覺處理今後新發生之情勢，蔣介石之地位已因此而强化。蔣依然爲國家元首，且爲渝軍之最高司令官，此次所讓出之行政院長，在過去五個月，渠已僅負虛名，實際上由宋子文擔任工作，蓋宋早已被任爲代理院長業。宋此番赴舊金山衝外交，今會議甫畢，即發表眞除，暗示宋在美國之交涉已有若干成功。傅舊金山會議關於美國對渝財政援助亦會談及，今蔣辭去行政院長致職，關於國內間題當已强化其行動之自由，今後可隨時否認行政院及其部長之職權。渝方今後之經濟危機，當然甚大，宋之出馬，當爲解決此問題，然宋子文非武人而爲銀行家，故其地位當然不若蔣介石之强有力，美國對之雖有信賴，惟渝軍對之，則未免冷淡耳。</p>

<p>— 黃莪</p>
<p>溱潼鎭距東台六十里·題泰縣亦六十里，爲兩縣之間的一個大鎭。內河輪船公司泰東班輪間日往復經此一次。市　櫛比，商業繁盛，屬東台縣之第七區，舊與泰縣屬之姜堰鎭，同爲蘇北土產糧食集散中心地，隱居各縣貿易行市上之決定地位，一切價格須視姜堰溱潼兩地之價格而轉移。在往昔極盛時期，稻麥堆積甚豐，大倉小廩。隨地面是，今因各縣交通間阻，沿途損稅重重，鄉間遊開縱橫，盒糧價格騰貴等種種關係，上述繁榮現象，已隨歷史的洪流而成爲過去的陳跡了！</p>
<p>地利環境極為優越</p>
<p>篠潼四而環水，形如孤烏，全鎭市廛，宛在水之中央，故天然形勢極佳，無論東南西北，舟　均可通航，商業發達，此亦爲總要原因。平素出產魚　　水鴨最為著名，附近民出，　　沃壞　，以是住民飲實實者多，期居生活，　尙優　，豪移之風，爲全縣冠。事　以來，以地處偏僻，從未有重大眾事行動。此爲蘇北各縣區鄉鎭中僅有之現象。惟當民國三十年和平易　時，一切地方軍政變革難均在平靜中安穩渡過，但秩序紊亂治安失常者，亦有兩三月之久。幸後此歷次駐軍畏官，俱知肅軍愛民，整飭部屬，故人民負担雖增而不加怨。况自前年第三十四師一三五團自　茶移防該鎭以來，市面日趨繁榮，地方漸趨興復。</p>
<p>現駐防該鎭者爲蘇北綏靖主任公署陸軍獨立第二十旅，旅長徐容，其治軍之經騐與學識，爲蘇北和平軍人中之佼佼者。去年秋，孫良誠將軍來任蘇北　靖主任，第三十四師師畏田　夫率部調浙，而徐團仍獨留駐篠潼，足徵防區內人民情感之深，挽留之股。</p>
<p>記者於五月一日晨　泰東班輸自東台往溱潼，三小時即達，抵該鎭後，往第二十旅旅部訪徐旅長，徐旅長即發表其治軍經過如次；</p>
<p>整理稅收清除三害</p>
<p>「自前年舉令率部由拼茶移防此問後，即知此間人民負擔極重，捐稅重重，以致市面蕭條，百業凋敝。挽救之道，當自減輕負担，取消苛雜始。故自移防部署元畢後，即着手整頓稅收及改正人民捐納方法，並一面嚴禁部屬需索，無事不許外出，以免滋擾，一面汰除有眷屬之士兵官佐，俾得專心軍旅，以免拖累。同時，對於士兵待遇，酌量提高，平素訓練，決不鬆懈，即工事建築，無必要決不徵用民伕，概由官兵自己動手，以免閒則生非。對於有害地方之烟賭娼三害，在職權範圍內，絕對禁絕，不予寬容。並設有軍警稽查處，每日淸查輸埠旅舍，嚴防奸宄及不逞份子。以是一年以來，治安日漸確立，秩序日益恢復，而市面亦日趨繁榮。吾輩軍人，職在保衛國家，捍禦地方，區區應盡之責，自不敢詡爲有功，但求無過，即對得住自己良心了。」</p>
<p>述至此，記者復問道：「據聞旅長對於地方教育之興復，亦極關心，不騐目下情形如何？」</p>
<p>渠答謂：「自事變以來，頗感各地淸寒靑年及適齡兒童失學之可慮：故每在駐防區內，勉就能力所及，設失恢復二中小學，以示提倡，刻在溱潼，利用破舊廟宇，稍加修葺，作爲校址，現設有私立溱潼初級中學所，長江小學，溱　小學兩所。教職員均提高待遇，以實物帶薪，至於淸寒子弟均視情形，減免學膳各費，以示優待。三校經常費，均由余設法濤措，刻溱中校長由旅部上校參議孟思源君担任學生百餘人。兩小學校長均教育界知名之士，學生計共五百餘人。……」</p>
<p>記者復問：「以目前隊北情形而論，危機四伏，隱憂甚深，例如苛捐雜稅之重疊征收，强梁大猾之巧取豪奪，區鄉鎭長之倚勢橫行，共黨之擴大，無一不予良善人民以重大成脅。如何改善，旅變於軍務倥　之暇，亦曾考慮及此否？」</p>
<p>安定民生爲第一義</p>
<p>渠聞言，略作沈思，即答謂：「軍人以服從爲第一義。它姑不論，單就蘇北情形而言，自孫綏靖主任蒞臨後，蘇北各種悄况，已日趨好轉，果能假以時日，則尊論所慮各點，自不難日漸消弭，目前軍政方面之最主要工作，莫如爭取民心，以安民爲第一義。」</p>
<p>渠言而至，即邀記老參觀其旅部，旅部地址爲古壽聖寺，旁鄰長江公園，（係紀念第一集團總司令李長江將軍者）佔地甚廣，旅部四周適在加强建築工事中，士兵揮汗工作，努力不怠，時公園內操塲上軍士教育班，正在操練，而旅部內參謀，政訓，軍需，軍醫，軍法，軍城各處室均佈置井井有條，深覺其治軍嚴整，決非虛譽。</p>

<p>市宣傳處主持之第十九次記者例會，於昨日上午十時半，在市府會議室舉行，由袁衛生局長出席解答各問題如左：</p>
<p>防疫注射</p>
<p>（問）夏令防疫注射，關係公共衛生至大且鉅，無知市民多方規　，貴局有無致　强迫注射，擬挨戶調查注射否？</p>
<p>（答）防疫注射市民當多規避，故在開始時，即咨請警察局派員協助。最近即將於保甲區挨戶注射，故又將所有注射地點日程，函請警局協助辦理。</p>
<p>隔離醫院</p>
<p>（問）防疫注射原爲防患未然，但有疾病發生時，病者多慌張失措，擬如何促使市民得知防疫免費醫院之所在地？</p>
<p>（答）本局所屬有長安路，北海路，南市（即前紅房子婦孺醫院），滬西（地點梵皇渡路）蠔隔離醫院，長安路醫院因一部份已被軍部徵用，故衹能收容六〇人，北海路醫院有狀位二百只，有市醫院有三十五只，以上共計祇有床位三百只，故萬一發生疫癘，收容實感不敷，市府准照舊年辦法，設立臨時隔離醫院，以廣收容。</p>
<p>夏令衛生</p>
<p>（問）夏令公共衛生，異常重要，馬路里弄垃圾陰溝汚水之淸除，及沿街沿路不潔瓜果，不良食物之取締，貴局有無具體辦法？</p>
<p>（答）夏令衛生保爲重要，里弄垃坡亟應淸除，除飭令主管人員注意辦理外，尤盼居民切勿隨意亂倒，用特印製公告，分發各區居民，務須在規定時間內，將垃圾倒置規定地點，以便淸除。至於陰溝淸塞，防空壕不淸等情，已分函建設局及防空本部，注意辦理。關於街頭攤販，早有規定地點，不准任意亂擺，本局迭函警局協助取締，但攤販之設與社會問題極有關係，故亦未可徒唱高調，不顧實際。除對於不潔飲食物嚴加取締外，關於一般街頭攤販之取締，正與有關局處嚴密商討中。</p>
<p>平民診治</p>
<p>（問）本市傳染性疾病，時有發生，平民階級診治費用，多不勝負担，貴局有無考慮平民免費治療等措置？</p>
<p>（答）本局北海路隔離醫院，有普通病房，專爲醫治平民階級，故不收費，其他各醫院所收費用，均係遵照市府規定，所收醫藥費極少。</p>
<p>郊區防疫</p>
<p>（問）市區郊區防疫官傳與實施工作如何？</p>
<p>答（答）本局爲普及防疫常識起見，侮星期五派員在上海電台廣播宣傳，至於防疫實施工作，本局有霍亂注射臨時班四十六隊，每日在市郊區爲民衆注射，當稱順利。但　射人數，至今不過五十二萬餘人，（虹口海軍保甲區除外，因該區不由本局担任）下月十二日起，並擬另派注射人員，前往吳淞·江灣·眞茹等處實施注射。</p>
<p>化驗成藥</p>
<p>（問）有　衛生及健康而經化騐之成藥，各該藥商每多遇事誇張宣傳，貴局對此有何意見？</p>
<p>（答）本局取締醫藥誇大宣傳係遵照衛生署所頒規軍按步實行。最近據報有藥廠商發售假，一俟查竣，即將予以嚴勵處分。</p>

<p>財政部稅務署以化粧品特稅，第一類牙粉，牙靑，香皂等稅率，從價征白分之十二，第二類胭脂，髪臘，香粉，香皂等稅率從價征百分之七十。惟因原有前訂之估價，亦不適現時市價，故特召集評價委員會議決定，按照原有估價提高十倍，業經呈准財政部通令所屬，自昨一日起實行。</p>

<h3 id="c43">日本各地空襲　民間防空情形　齊藤患男考察返滬談話 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>市民防空本部於本年四月初，派警防處高級職員實藤忠男，赴日本各地考察被炸情形，及民間防空任務，達二月餘，業於前（二十六）日返滬。據談考察情形　詳，茲分誌如左：</p>
<p>敵機實施盲目轟炸</p>
<p>去年十一月初，敵機開始向日本各地盲施轟炸，各主要都市，如東京·名古屋·大阪。神戶。以及其他各區，先後被炸遭災。敵機之轟炸絕無人道，來擊時先分成「井」字形，即　　燒夷彈及其他炸彈，繼而再分成縱橫綫轟炸，形成棋盤式，故在被轟炸之城市火焰冲天，逃避困難。其火焰單獨房屋可高至二層至三層以上，尤以密集者，更爲熾烈，縱橫火力，可竄至四百公尺至五百公尺左右，寬闊之馬路，亦可能延至對面及四週。於火焰中，球火車之車胎以及汽油汽缸等，時有爆裂着火者，即　骨水泥房屋，其火力或可從窗口竄進，而遭　如。</p>
<p>工廠疏散損失輕微各工業區域，早作防備，實施疏散，大型工廠　爲小型工廠，工廠密集之處，爲防止燒夷彈之蔓延，均加隔離，將房屋關開築成寬闊之道路，並在每一工廠之四週開掘　溝，永久儲有大量防空用水，被炸後即可使用灌救，民火勢亦無從萬延。同時每一工廠築有堅固完善之防空壕，均可容納每班工人數，百分之一百五十以上，雖在接空班時被炸，尚留廠內之工人，亦可避難，故損害極度輕微，生產不受影嚮。</p>
<p>燒夷彈急救辦法關於急救辦法本都市之人口，已大部疏散，除必要者外，十九已避至鄉郊各處，但侮一房屋內均須駐人，蓋四磅至六磅之　夷彈，人力可予撲成，故在日本都市每隔七公尺之侮一幢房屋內，均積儲大良用水，馬路上侮隔一百二十公尺，築一防空用貯水池，每一池之水，最少可供救火車四五小時之用。若干區域，事實上可能引海水江水入口，開築小型河浜，以便必要時應用，一面並開掘防空壕。統計每戶均掘有可容一家人避難之防空壕。公共防空壕，東京一處已達七十萬以上，倘每一防空壕，可容五人，則有三百五十萬人可避難。但是項防空壕，倘被擲燒夷彈時，仍將失其效用。查日本有一某名醫家庭內，築有堅强防空壕，被炸時一家人及鄰居人內避難，詎料燒夷彈將該處全部燒毀，避難入防空壕者，無從逃出，皆被燒死在內，故在敵機擲燒夷彈時，防空壕亦將失其效用，恐出人口着火而無法逃出也。至於本市鋼骨水泥房屋。如參照日本之被炸悄形·火焰熾烈時，亦將失其效用。是以在窗口宜用防火器</p>
<p>三件實施可供參考茲有三件實施値得參考，即於東京被炸時，有一次有市民六萬餘人，均携帶箱儲，同時避在一荒塲，繼而某警察分局亦被炸，　　紛避該塲，發覺若干箱物已着火，勢必蔓延，乃令市民將箱物完全拋入附近海中，火勢無從蔓延，而些六萬餘人得保全生命，故於逃難時，人民絕對不得携帶　見或箱　。同時對易燃燒之物，更宜少帶，服裝亦易簡便。防空人員·亦須先救生命。其二，爲一國民小學校於以此正北轟炸時。因其屋爲鋼骨水泥所建。避難者不下二萬餘人，當時火勢有從窗口侵入之勢，當由領導者令衆人設法將避火窗速放下，人多手快，且同心協力，得免於難。其三，亦爲一國民小學校，向以安樂之土，避難者甚　，其次被炸時，領導者發覺敵機將以該屋作侵製目標，當令避難者急速趨避他處，末幾果被轟炸着火，避難者得免於災。因此感到於必要時，羣衆之自救力，頗關軍要，知道者更應隨機應變，知道有房。總之，市民防空，須爲自己防空，蓋於急難時，旁人恐難頗及。市民防空之任務，即爲自己救自己，望全市人民注意及之。</p>

<p>冲繩的決戰，正在日以繼夜的這進着。日軍木其必死必中的悲壯決心，海陸空三軍一體，前仆後繼的不斷猛攻美軍機動部隊。時時有特攻隊出發殲敵的荔地，充滿了騰騰的殺氣，揚溢着愛國的熱情。下面是日本南丸州某特攻　地某士官所做的一　記事文，雖然不畏，却也充分表明了日軍殲敵的決心，以及基地上的悲壯氣慨。</p>
<p>落英繽紛　聲婉轉</p>
<p>近年的天氣雖冷，然而在這裏——南九州——却早是明媚的春天了。不過是四月初旬時分，已是落英繽紛了。可是，兵舍前後，含露的八重櫻的大蕾如雲如霧，宛若夢境。淸最，鶯聲婉囀。假使頭上沒有飛機的軋軋聲，朝上起來，簡直忘記已在戰時。一天二十四小時內，頭上老有飛機翔翔，有的是友機，有的是敵機。　有這清晨的片刻，使人暫時忘去了身在戰中</p>
<p>「今日的天氣也很好，可繼績進行預訂的攻擊。」參謀長對走向食堂的長官說。</p>
<p>其實呢，名稱雖是食堂，也不過是薄板搭成的平房而已，地位是十　大小，而且周　的木板均未</p>
<p>「唔，今天定能好好兒幹啦，祇要天氣不壞就行，大家都很自信自己的手腕呢！」長官悠悠然說，坐在食桌旁。幕僚們也繩着坐下。</p>
<p>「今晨的天氣眞不錯哪！昨天，可糟糕，老是勢。今日起來，向天一望，眞開心！」長官老是從容不迫的，不論署到誰，都含微笑。</p>
<p>「雲消霧散兮祇餘春夢——你們說怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>幕僚不解風流，相顧瞠然。呀。」長官袛好自己來說明。</p>
<p>「雄壯固然雄壯，不過沒有季節。俳句是要與季節有關的。我的就提及季節了。」長官面有得色的說，將碗交給勤務兵；這是第二碗了。</p>
<p>「是的，不過我的長川柳，哈哈哈……」參謀長大聲笑了起來。</p>
<p>「參謀長的是俗曲呀！」屋隅有一個聲音設，外面傳入了一陣鶯囀聲。</p>
<p>「畏官，飯後請蒞臨〇〇隊。」航空參謀看看早餐即將用完，便向長官說。</p>
<p>「唔。」放下飯碗，長官的臉色立即換上嚴肅的表情。</p>
<p>特政隊員道時正圍集在隊長周圍，專心討論作戰計書。隊長是一個靑年太尉。</p>
<p>以我一機拚他一艦</p>
<p>以直角的角度向航空母艦　去，固然是最理想的，不過，我們的飛機好像我們的頭，比較笨重，所以是難得做到的。因爲不能在敵前迅即取得高度，所以一定是向敵艦的橫腹撞去的。近水面的部分原是最好的地方，可是有突入海中之　，所以要瞄準距離水面稍高之處，懂得嗎，年輕人？飛機雖則笨重，炸彈可是大的，所以一定要一機拚他一艦！大家要仔細看看周圍的情形，不要自己互相擠撞起來。我總是向着敵艦列正中的傢伙的，兩　應跟在我後面，分向左右，各自選定目標撞去，如果撞不中，那就是我們的損失了。還有，飛入突擊進路特，切勿忘記拔去炸彈的保險針。萬一忘掉了，那就糟啦！記性不好的人，應該在遮風板上大書：突入時拔保險針。那怕是曾蒙恩賜的優等生，如果忘掉此事，也就落第啦！愛……愛——隊長的說明彷彿永遠不會元的，如同向新兵訓話一樣，再詳細也沒有了。隊員們都嘴角帶笑，靜靜聽着。在他們飛行服的袖臂上背上，都綴着小的日章。飛行帽上，則一律插着一小枝櫻花。頭包白長巾的頻爽姿態，實比紅　鎧甲的古武士更美。一個靑年隊員的頭巾上，在其垂下的雨端，一端寫着「盡忠報國」四字，一端寫着「南無妙法　華經」字樣。是他。己寫的嗎？抑是別人替他寫上的？我凝視着這個不過十八·九歲的少年的側面，不覺合起堂來。</p>
<p>生死如一勝利可期「有了這樣的日本還會敗嗎？一定會勝利的！我們以爲苦難的時候，敵人也覺困苦的。誰能忍受住，誰就得到最後的勝利，况且我們並不覺得苦。看哪，年輕人不是爲了君國而完爾從征嗎？生死如一，這就是勝利可期的原因。」</p>
<p>待攻隊的飛機，一架架留下隆隆的引擎聲，飛向天的那方。頭巾上寫着「盡忠報國」的少年，左手握住了操縱桿，右手舉到眉際，向送行者致敬告別。他的飛機轟轟然離了地，我不覺緊合雙掌。一想到壯士一去不復返的不吉利，禁不住落霞淚來。</p>
<p>「日本必勝！」我高高舉起了軍刀。（譯自五月三日讀賣報知）</p>
<p>竹　中；一條狹長的山道，雖受着强烈的陽光，這裹仍是冷幽幽似的。走過其最高處，便是一個廣大的飛機塲。我不思不想地在這坡坂上走。半路上，突然有一個念頭閃進我的腦內，使我不覺停住脚步。看吧，這個被獻身社國的特攻隊員無數足跡踏實了的紅土。自從三月十八日以來，已有數百「神鷲」大踏步走過了這條路。這怎不叫人感動呢？</p>
<p>神聖的小徑特工隊基地素描</p>
<p>「道條小徑是國寶啊一提土均有敬祀的充分意義！勝利之日，此處的每二。」一個同　會懇切地說過這樣一句話。</p>
<p>自從到這們荔地來以後，巳有一個半月。在翠竹的陰凉靑色下，開放在這裏那裏的季節之花，已變了好幾次啦。梅花·桃花·櫻花·棠棣·菜花。紫靈英·杜鵑花等，全是道地的日本感覺。它們正是二·三小時之後即將神逝的年輕特攻隊員出發時的餞儀。事實上·海軍航空隊員是喜愛這此花的。所謂日本的「傅統」·似乎是生在這些花中，也生在愛花的心情中。</p>
<p>「本來以爲梅花開時就幹啦，不料已到櫻花時節了！」</p>
<p>裝着特別爆炸機械的飛機上，飾着櫻花。在那許多年靑的價秀臉上，隱隊可以　初「日本武失」的傅統。</p>
<p>神風特別攻擊隊員的表情，沒有什麼「特別」。夏威夷海戰以來，海軍航空隊員的明朗表情，迄今沒有什麼變化。用「紳駕」兩字來稱呼他們，或許給人以什麼修　教科書化似的感覺，然而這批勇士們絲毫沒有裝鬆作勢，仍如平常一樣，談笑自若。神鷲一聽到出征，更是勇氣百倍，昂昂大步地出發。尤其是預科練習出身的而十歲前後的下士官，他們出征時更加熱烈。</p>
<p>「眞會吃哪，你！」出發前，某兵曹一邊　乾麵包，一邊喝汽水，兩個頰也給嘴裏的糖果塞得拱了起來。他的戰友不覺　奇起來。可是，他一點不介意，照舊吃他的東西。</p>
<p>「我的爸爸媽媽直到死的時候止，這是很胖的。」他邊吃邊說。</p>
<p>「喂，平飯沒有吃　？」</p>
<p>「是呀，吃了不過三碗呢！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……」大家都笑起來了。</p>
<p>「今天。靖國神社司浬食桌的使者一定很忙，因爲有新人呀！」</p>
<p>「山本元帥和東鄉元帥也出來迎接吧。」</p>
<p>「那我們不要失禮才好哩！」</p>
<p>時間到了，但出擊的命令還沒有下來。</p>
<p>「快些兒去呀，別慢慢地。還有，活着的時候，香烟總是要緊的·」</p>
<p>如果問他們出生地方什麼地方，　　們總喜歡說是九州人·這使神鷲們的　國　更加熱　，而且是男性地的。在這裏，橫在眼前的「死」，已不是黑暗的，而使人感到是光亮透明的，似乎他們是在幹一件極其「普通不過的事」。</p>
<p>「我要一舉粉碎英美的歷史！」神鷲們都有這　明朗的　信。他們將談笑赴死。</p>
<p>「殉國是日本人當然的事。至於特攻隊等名稱，沒有也無關係。」上飛曹說。</p>
<p>生於悠久的大義這回事，我在這個基地上每天看到。（齊藤信也）（譯自五月九日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c52">解决市民用水問題 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>自本年三月份起，本市自來水供應當局將用永限量再行減少百分之三十，及氣候轉入用水特別浩繁的夏季之後，用永似乎已經到達成爲嚴重問題的熊勢了。可是水爲生活必需品之一，我們非想法使這用水問題澈底解決不可。筆者以爲要解決用水問題，須作多方而設法：</p>
<p>以光易水　現在自來水的供給量之所以減少，據　是因爲」打水」所需的電力供給減少，要增加自來水的供給量，必須增加對自來水公司的電力供給量。因此，我們一方面希望對於全　浪費性和奢侈性的電力使用，　　限制，即使爲全體市民的福利着想，對於此類用途的電力，根本停止供給，實亦不算過分。在另一方面，我們寗願以電燈用電力節省下來，轉作自來水打水之用，以便增加自來水的供給量。節省用電的方法，可行者有二：一，目前已入夏季，天亮較早，天暗較　，各公司行號機關的辦公時間，不妨一律提早一小時，例如銀行錢莊的營業時間，本自九時起，不妨改爲早上八時起，如此，非但並無不便之處，反因早晨天氣淸凉，可以增加工作效力。果能實行提早辦公時間，則晚上電燈發光時間即可由七时半起至十时止；改爲由七時半起至九時止。二，按自來水缺乏相當的代巷品，而爲人人所必需，然電燈有油燈爲代替品，且非人人所必需；倘能日出而作，日沒而息，根本可以用不到燈光。所以當用前一方法所節電力，還不足以充分增加自來水供紛量時，　獲得日常生活所必需的足量自來水，寗願完全犧　菲必需品（比較而言）的電燈光。即使當局將電燈用電力完全移作打水用電力，在市民方而（占絕大多數的中夏階級市民）所感受的不使，至少比自來水的渦分不够用，要好得多。因爲我們如需要燈光，還可以較賤的價錢來買燈油燃油燈，以需要自來水，却非忍受超過限量二成以上，照原價二十倍的罰款不可。加以光的需要有彈性的，水的需要，沒有彈性的。</p>
<p>按人配給現在各自來水用戶的使用限量，是根據過去各該尸實際用量作爲決定的基礎，於是過去十分浪費自來水，和人數較少的用戶，却得到極大便宜。過去十分節約自來水和人數衆多的用戶却大吃其虧。由此可知根據渦去實際用量來分配自來水，　然不合理。對於這種不公平分配的現象，希望自來水當局迅速糾正，希快快和保甲當局合作，把自來水按人數配給。易　之，即根據各用戶的人數，計算各該用戶的最大使用量。如用戶爲一里　　或公寓，住戶甚多，並無分水表的　置，那末該里弄或公寓中各居戶間如何分配，由各該里弄或公寓的保甲衆想法合理分配之。</p>
<p>利用井水開掘士井，多掘土井，非但爲防空上的重要設施，抑且在此自來水供應量大爲減少的今日，對用水問題的解決，至少能供獻一些方量。我們在不妨礙衛生的條件下，除洗滌食物和用作飲料外，儘量多用井水，例如拖地板，洗門窗，倒馬桶，及洗滌衣服等不妨使用井水。不過不佞要特別提出警告各井水用戶，絕對不可把用畢的汚水倒於井口附近地上，必須傾水於淸溝中，使流入陰溝。如此，可以保特井水的澄淸。倘天天將汚水倒於井口附鈑地上，日積月累，井水必然變質，到那時非傾入大量石灰或明　，加以消毒之後，就不能使用，這是經騐之談，非屬空洞的理論。</p>
<p>用水問題，已至十分嚴重的境地，最有力量的解決者還是自來水當局，希望他們努力設法放寬用水限量。</p>

<p>本市滬西一帶，小河支渠甚多，其中大都爲兩端淤塞不通的死水河。年久，水巴變做汚黑，穢物累積，便溺滿地·又有些死貓死狗浸在水裏。天時稍暖，臭氣四散，傳佈疫癘，蚊蚋叢生。附近居民，受害匪淺。尤以梵皇渡路南段，金家巷內的一條小河爲甚。該處地勢又低，每次大雨以後，遍地積水，好比澤國。那小河裏的汚水就和地面上的雨永混合在一起，漸潮流廣開來，又和附近各里弄中的積水混在一起。多數儉省的居民，捨不得化黃包車錢，就脫掉鞋襪，涉水而行。回到家裏，不消兩天，雙足就爛了起來。而那金家巷裏，又是半邊是路，半邊是河，下了大雨之後，被水淹沒，就分不出那半邊是路，那半邊是河，稍不熟悉的行人和車子經過，就會連人帶車翻入河裹，等到旁人救起來時，已是一個落湯雞，而且也已經飽嘗異味了。從前也曾經有人提議過將河塡築馬路，但是那時因委是公共租界的越界築路，兩不管的地段，所以沒有實行。現在大上海市政旣完全統一，希望本市建設富局先派員前往該處調查，再謀改善。該河西至梵王渡路（近迪化路口）東至膠州路，迪接新閘路底，如塡築馬路時，將河畔石子路一併算入，此路可闊二丈。目前該處多係棚戶，然　路以後，即可逐漸改造房屋，設立店　，那時市容當爲之一新。</p>
<h3 id="c54">再論强化消防 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑左祺</p>
<p>自從西康路藥水弄及餘姚路二處棚戶大火災以後，本市居民始知消防工作之重要性，尤其在戰時之上海，消防設施更形需要。本市之消防設施雖較其他都市完善，然而在一般貧民　居之處與工廠區域（尤其是棚戶區），因人口密集，居處湫溢，一有火災即蔓延不止，救火車旣不及駛到，又缺少消防設施，以致造成慘事，藥水弄及餘姚路火災就是兩個明　的例子。</p>
<p>我們再看日本東京因爲道路寬闊，消防設施的比較完善，所以消減火災亦較容易，返顧我國，道路狹隘·又缺乏防設備，故受火災的損害亦很大。希望以後對於房屋建設的復興工作，建設局及火政常局能加以指導改善，俾合消防原理。</p>
<p>至於餘姚路火災，太平龍頭發生陣碍，也是一個重要原因。故消防用之沙土及儲水確爲不可少的，深望火政當局對於水龍頭能常加修理，以免臨時失措。此外，救死療傷的藥品亦須有相當的準備。</p>
<p>總之，此次火災所賜之教訓，爲使我們發覺了本市之消防設施尚欠健全，深望以後能利用保甲機構，强化消防設施，務在消防方面使上海成爲全國之模範都市。</p>

<p>木市面積遼闊，道路　橫，事變後人口達五百餘萬，陸上交通工具之管理，　戰於公共安寗秩序者，至深且鉅·昔以租界之存在，行政系統旣分，管理手續亦繁，目下市政統一，此項行政，概歸本局主管。兩月以來，力謀底整頓之方針。首對各車　登記所機構加以調整，就前塋用局時期，所設江寗路·長興路，公平路·馬當路·南市。滬西·閘北。浦東。吳淞·南滙。奉賢·閔行。嘉定。寶山·崇明等各車輛登記所中先行裁撤馬當路車輛登船所，將該所過去事辦全市目用三輪車及自用人力車登記，檢騐及發照宜事，一律依照車主所在地，劇　各區登記所分別辦理，以資便利。復以原有中江·奉賢·南匯·嘉定·寶山。崇明各縣區車輛登記所，距局過遠，鞭長莫及·不易管理，並爲使縣政統一，便於督促起見，自四月份起己一律裁撤，所有各該縣區車輛登記所事務，均交由各縣政府遵照定章，繼續辦理。至浦東·南市·滬西·閘北·市中心區各區，車輛登記所，因本局在各該區內已設有辦事處，爲實行行政關素化計，自四月一日起一律歸併人各辦事處，設立車務組，繼績　理各該區車輛登記事務。</p>

<h3 id="c57">阿順 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 李天深</p>
<p>阿順玩得起勁的時候·眞像一位小將軍，成風凜凜，不過一聽見他媽媽一喊他，他就萎縮得　一個敗陣的蟋蟀，倒退下去。</p>
<p>再過幾個月，阿順就八歲了！</p>
<p>「八歲的鬼，還時常把尿撒在狀上，撒尿　是好的呢！那一天撒了一狀尿屎，從　板一直漏到箱子蓋上，他選睡得像死猪一樣，你看該打不該打！」</p>
<p>阿順媽打過阿順　終有一篇理論，以表明她是一個賢明的母親。</p>
<p>「該打，是該打！一阿順媽的活，從來就沒有錯·從來就沒有人反對過。</p>
<p>反正像阿順這樣一個不成材的東西·將來終沒有什麼大出息在那兒，「從小看成，六歲看到老。」還不是揀垃圾·推車子，到底不是正料！</p>
<p>阿　眞不是正料，就連「阿順媽」這各名稱·喊了　不滿三年。</p>
<p>三年前，阿順爺又死丟一個新生至兒子以後，就灰心得了不得，怪不得算命先生說他們，夫妻倆命裹該定是一對孤老，大女兒昭女如果不長過繼給灶公菩薩的話，也早巳但是只要行善，多做點好事，補補前世作的擎，也許上天有好生之德，使李家不增後代。</p>
<p>所以阿順媽曾發下願，每天敬三次香，上天如賜一個麟兒的話，還更吃月　。</p>
<p>果然不到半年，阿順媽壯裹有喜予。</p>
<p>於是，一　房裹的人全哄動了，都說好心有好報，像李大爺這樣一個信大吃飯的人，是不應絕後</p>
<p>胎雖然懷了，但不知是男是女，連算命測字先生也不能算到，這眞使阿順爺夫妻倆着急得了不得。假使是一個女的話，不是……</p>
<p>所以阿順媽又發下心願上天如是賜一個男兒的話，一定每月進廟燒香。</p>
<p>阿根媽已經有兩個月的胎了，可是心依然不定</p>
<p>這時候，從遠方來了一位表親——一位德高氣祥的太太——指點醒了他們夫妻倆的迷路。</p>
<p>「我媳婦富奶媽的陳公館，老爺快五十歲了，太太終是不　，後來太太沒有法自，到覺兒堂去領了一各小孩，當作自己的兒子，不過一年功夫，太太野懷胎了，而目是一個男孩子……後來太太請算命先生一算，才知道這都歸功於這領來的孩子……。」</p>
<p>「後來？」</p>
<p>「後來……。現在這兩個的孩子都畏大了，尤其是太太親生的……。」</p>
<p>「是的——隔　馮大媽的玲弟·不也是領來的嗎？現在果然領了個弟弟來，算命先生說她命好，馮大媽將她認作自己的媳婦——將她配了她領來的弟弟。」</p>
<p>「阿！這東西眞靈，那你們爲什麽不也領個孩子來壓壓順呢？」</p>
<p>阿順媽經老太太一提，眞如夢初醒，便決定要去領一個孩子了。</p>
<p>幾百個孩子中的幸運者——阿順便被領來了。</p>
<p>這是一個骨排很大而很瘦的孩子，一身不知名的瘡，大的頭，放在瘦弱的肩上，大的眼深陷在　頭般的眼眶裹，閃着無神的光，食量非常的大——一切都現着窮　，但在幾百個孤兒裏面，可算得出類拔萃的了——這是阿順爺夫妻倆費了兩天的功夫挑選的成績。</p>
<p>阿順一起先是不叫阿順，但他叫什麽？這從沒有人提起過，阿順這名字是跟着「壓順」來的，來到家的一日·就算是阿順的生日。</p>
<p>阿順這一來由火坑升到天堂，由一天兩頓稀飯一碗豆腐漿，改成了三頓乾的，選有零食吃，衣服也穿得很好，於是沒有幾個月，阿順就成了一身胖肉的大槐頭了。阿順爺夫妻倆爲了阿順，眞用了不少心血，阿順一到家·就替他把一身瘡看好，還教他怎樣稱呼他們倆，最後還教他——：</p>
<p>「阿順，人家間你媽肚裏是弟弟還是味妹？你說是弟弟。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「堯得馬？」</p>
<p>「你媽肚裹是弟弟，還是味妹？」</p>
<p>「人家問我是弟弟，還是妹妹，我講是弟弟。</p>
<p>阿順這孩子眞笨，連這幾句話，也學了有兩個星期才學會，有時還常常講錯。</p>
<p>當由人問他：「你　壯裹是弟弟，還是味妹？」</p>
<p>「弟弟。」</p>
<p>阿順媽拉開了嘴笑了笑。</p>
<p>然後阿順就受到一家人的恭維。</p>
<p>可是阿順還時常講錯，這當然是免不了阿順媽心裹的不快。</p>
<p>「阿順，你媽肚裹是弟弟還是妹妹？」</p>
<p>「妹……」</p>
<p>這時阿順媽的臉就扳起來了。</p>
<p>阿順雖然只有六歲·但也知道看「風勢」，看見媽扳起的面孔，就知道自己是說錯了，速忙校了正：</p>
<p>「……弟弟。」</p>
<p>阿順媽依然笑了笑，但看樣子笑得不大高興。</p>
<p>阿順雖然時常講錯，但平均起來，「弟弟」講得比「妹妹」多。這在阿順媽眼裏看來，似乎有點「把握」了。</p>
<p>阿順媽抓住了這「把握」平安地過了幾個月懷胎時期，阿順也過了半年多舒服的生活。</p>
<p>經過了阿順爺夫妻俯儘心調養下的阿順，長得又白又胖，誰也看不出他是孤兒院裹領來的孩子。</p>
<p>別人見了他，眞替阿順爺歡喜。</p>
<p>「眞好福氣，這孩子長得眞不准。」</p>
<p>福氣。阿順爺笑了笑，他簡直是不敢以爲自己是一個有福氣的人，這短短的兩惆字，使他回想到以前——二十年前……</p>
<p>一個白胖了的孩子，在他的眼前活動着，漸漸地，漸漸地……孩子一天一天地長大，由吃奶吃奶糕，慢慢的會吃粥吃飯，會坐會爬，會叫他爺爺了，那時他才以爲自己是配得上稱一聲有福氣的人。</p>
<p>豈知一傷生　，將孩子瘦了一大半，一塲痧子，斷送了孩子整惆的生命</p>
<p>牛　是請一位有五十年經騐的老先生種的，　子運劉大仙的神針都醫不好，這孩子是該死！果然後來算命先生說這孩子是貴人，他們倆沒有福氣擔　。</p>
<p>從此，　順爺就　爲自己是一個沒有　氣的人</p>
<p>接着，第二個孩子，從老婆的肚子裏掉下米，面孔很像已死的一惆，於是阿順爺夫妻倆，恐怕又沒有福氣留住他，連忙過繼給一家有着三男四女的同鄉。</p>
<p>這樣一來，孩子果然留住干，直至第三個的產生——是一個女孩子。</p>
<p>阿順爺的生活，這時可算得快榮極樂，望望會走的兒子，親親吃奶的女兒。</p>
<p>不幸得很，一個活發的孩子，不知怎麼一來，害了一塲還沒有廿四小時功失的毛病，就沒有氣了，阿順爺夫妻倆差不多連張天師都請來過，也不能挽住他，到底是他們倆沒有福份！</p>
<p>兒子是去了，還有一個女兒，長得很玲瓏活撥，一家三口人——一個是孩子的外婆，恐怕她也是一個短命鬼，後來還是外婆想出了一個孩子，將她過繼給灶公菩蘭，起名叫「昭」女——才能平安地活到今天。</p>
<p>接着第四個，第五個，第六個一個個從阿順媽肚裹掉下來，一價從阿順爺手裹抱出去，最後才從一算命先生嘴裹知道他們這些都是討價鬼，眞的，阿順爺一點積蓄完全的化費在這些討債鬼身上。</p>
<p>阿順爺待阿順比親生的父親還要好，但他也有他的用意，他知道自已是一個沒有福氣的人，老婆肚裏的孩子，是要　他壓順的，他服侍阿順，是爲了第三者，老婆狀裏的天賜　兒。</p>
<p>时光終於到了麟兒降臨的一日，整個的後房間，不！全一幢房十都忙得很，差不多每一個人都說，是貴子，是天賜的麟兒！都期待着貴子的降臨，</p>
<p>天從人願！呱呱墮地的果然是一個男孩。於是侮個人都搶着說，李家是不該絕後代，慶聲轟動一</p>
<p>福將——阿順——道时候倒反而被人遺忘了。</p>
<p>貴子到底有一副貴像，尖起的額角，一點大的槐頭，小小的耳朵，最値得提起的是屁股後頭有兩塊大靑！落在盆裹的时候哭都不哭·後來，收生婆恨命地打了幾下·才哭出來，這種奇突的現像，當然是表明這貴子的不同凡響。</p>
<p>不貴子起名叫阿余。</p>
<p>阿金在「壓順」下·一天一天地長答·阿順倒一天一天失去了別人的恭維，一直到今天，阿順簡直成了別人的妨碍物。</p>
<p>阿順的確「犯嫌」，一身不知那兒來的肥肉·兩頰紅得發紫，話終是說出淸爽，走起路來蹣　蹣　地，來得死好吃，一看別人動嘴，他就像定了魂一樣，張大了眼睛，一動也不動地望着，這些都是叫阿順媽光火打他的原因</p>
<p>阿順非但好吃，而且死笨·快八歲的鬼·連洗只碗也不會洗，你要叫他抱抱弟弟，他準會把你嚇死！燒飯的時候，你要叫他拿個碗遞個醬油瓶也不</p>
<p>物價一天一天地高漲，阿順的飯量更能引起阿順媽的咒詛，這是一定的道理，因爲阿順大不能人阿順媽的眼了。</p>
<p>阿順更長得一身　骨，打死不怕，當他把尿撒在狀上，而受到皮帶抽打的時候，問他下次　撤不撒！他會死命地喊着：</p>
<p>「爺爺不撒了！」</p>
<p>然而第二天他又撒下來。這樣的一個廢物，不畏進的料，除了打以外似乎別的是沒有辦法。</p>
<p>所以我們每晚聽到阿順媽的咒罵聲，很大的從後房間溜人我們的耳朵，阿顧爺的皮帶聲很淸晰地抽在黑暗的空氣中，衹有阿順的哭泣聲很小很細……</p>
<p>阿順還很傻。</p>
<p>當我們看見他身上　隱的血跡，和戴靑的皮膚，問他這痛不痛？</p>
<p>他一聲不響。</p>
<p>有一次我抓住了他；</p>
<p>「阿順，這痛不痛？</p>
<p>他幽幽地回答我：</p>
<p>「痛……」</p>
<p>阿順就永達地過着痛的生活了！</p>
<p>但至少我們還以爲阿順是從地獄升到天堂的。</p>

<p>— 紀可鹿</p>
<p>太陽帶着凉意照在右子街上，風吹得很緊峭。</p>
<p>大餅師父的那個餅舖子，就儸促地居於石子街的一隅。每天每天，他老是把眼光從他那副「　」了脚的眼鏡裹看着過生的人們·看着過往的人們把脚熟悉地　在碎石街上。</p>
<p>一個大學生習慣地從這裏放下了一百元錢，又帶走了一角餅。</p>
<p>「他是老主顧了，」望着那熟悉的背影，大餅師父心裹有些不忍。「每天挾着那麼厚的一疊書本子，也許得走很多很多的路吧！明天，明天多切些餅給他吧！」</p>
<p>那滿衣打着補釘的背影，使他想起了自己的兒子，那不幸生癆病死了的兒子，從前不也是天天上學去的嗎？</p>
<p>一個黑影子一閃，他那靈活的孫子，提了一把茶壺，閃進門來，往桌子上一擱：</p>
<p>「剛才——大爹，剛才老虎灶老闆說的，明天開水漲價了！」</p>
<p>他心裏覺得有些悵惘，想起了死去的兒子，想起了生命才抽芽的孫子，日子如此難過，自己又是偌大的一把年紀……</p>
<p>二手正按着一大團麵粉使勁地撳壓着，他想把一切的愁，憂，煩悶，悵惘……全都撳在麵粉裹去，他就每天每天老是揉着；可是揉不完的麵團，就如同揉不盡的　，　，煩悶，惆悵……</p>
<p>狂風從街　帶來了灰沙，又從這裏帶去了餅香——　子上的餅又快烘好了。</p>
<p>餅香招致了一批顧客　。</p>
<p>一個小脚女人，從街道對面扭　着過來。</p>
<p>「多少錢一斤？」一手緊糧着鈔票，另一手儘把餅翻來覆去垂淞地看着。</p>
<p>「看樣子得先喘一口才育買呢！」大餅師父一面回答價錢，一面肚裏思</p>
<p>小脚女人拿起了一小角餅往嘴裹就塞，也不等大餅師父開口，就把手裹的鈔票往桌上一撩：</p>
<p>「稱一斤餅。」面孔上的得意之色就好像在說：」我有錢買餅，　一口不稀罕。」</p>
<p>「反正稱一斤餅呢，就讓她便宜了一口去吧！「大餅師父按住氣稱了一斤餅，又把餅切小，把錢找了，隨後又去揉那永遠揉不完的麵團去了。</p>
<p>小脚女忍　站着數鐵，好久好久才把錢放號了，拿起餅時又順手拈了一塊大的。</p>
<p>大餅師父這下子克耐不住火了，</p>
<p>「操你奶奶的，你這姨子，你買一斤餅要拿多少？」</p>
<p>小脚女忍可眞有一手，她不慌不忙地把餅往桌子上一扔：</p>
<p>「　！我是　言的，小脚登登地走了。</p>
<p>大餅師父的塗抹星子飛散在麵　上，社子　咕　着：</p>
<p>「眞是活見她媽的鬼·要不看見，就早已達達地拿走了。」</p>
<p>打發這些顧客，大餅師父眞覺得有些頭痛，那些喜歡佔小便宜的　客去了一批又來了一批，他們密願上街　的　子　上去碰運氣，把大疊的鈔票送進人家的口袋去。</p>
<p>喏！小脚女人又在跟齊小靑菜的吵架了，不是爲了欠錢不還，便是買好了菜想再撈一把……</p>

<h3 id="c61">全滬六路中西勁旅　參加甲組壘球聯賽　六月十日開賽在俄體育會 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>去年曾吸引球迷注目之全滬壘球聯賽，因　李之來臨將於最近電現於我人眼前。查去年聯賽中我華隊熊貓隊（pandas）需參加比賽，但因技不如人，未能奪得錦標。本年公開聯賽已於上星期日召開壘球聯賽委員會，決定於六月十日開始比賽。此次聯賽並非如前數年由菲僑所主辦，而由能　隊會長鄂奪博士任聯　委員會主席，定蓋聯賽爲熊貓盃。但其性質爲公開全滬聯賽。目前參加之中西勁旅巳達六隊之多。此六隊均爲鴻上第一流之壘球隊伍，內包括中日菲葡俄等國好手。各路雄師正積極準備練習，本年壘球季節將有一番盛况，可預卜也。</p>
<p>現懇悉此六隊之陣容及實力，介紹於球迷。</p>
<p>熊貓隊</p>
<p>熊貓隊乃聯賽中唯一之華人隊伍，曾於去年參加聯賽，對西隊大加威靑。但因球藝稍遜一籌，未能奪得歸標。本届由會長鄂森大事改組後，除球員新選定後，更延騁我國棒球界動輩梁扶初爲指導。查梁君曾在日本及香港，爲一著名棒球指導。其經騐及技　，有　到之處。前在香港指導中望棒球隊而獲國際錦標。熊貓目得　錦標之可能。滬上壘棒球錦標，我華人從未問津，此實因國人不甚注意棒壘球運動之結果。此次熊貓集滬上最堅强之華人壘球選手，準備與番隊一決雌雄。聯賽將因此提高與趣，我軍人球迷自必樂於欣賞也。該隊擁有留日名手深友聲溫瑞雄等人。復有捕手黃應瑞及二壘手溫天華　，更覺人才濟濟。熊貓之守壘曾於去年被譽爲全滬最佳。該隊唯一優點乃在接殺迅速及穩健，且內國各壘手有如銅牆鐵壁，密不可破。各外　接球穩當，如唐偉業·　保羅·王念知外，復有膠手王秀山王念祖等，均攻守俱佳。此外如各員之擊球技術均能左右開功，軟硬　施。叉如投手李啓　之旋風式投手，亦爲少有之人材。總之，該隊生氣勃勃，本届聯賽中必大有作爲也。</p>
<p>日僑隊</p>
<p>日僑隊（Crusades）乃淸一色之留美日本僑民所組織，爲本届人材最平均之一隊。該隊攻守均屬上承，如捕手爲日本最著名之明治大學棒球隊選手。接球之穩，無出其右。又如游擊手植烏乃美國南如州大學留學生，其接殺之迅速，及其左手之擊球，同屬著各於時。且該隊一壘手岩達之接球，百無一失。各員擊球技術平均，在本届聯賽中，將有最精彩表演。將來該除與熊貓比賽时，爲中日勁旅會師，勢必有一番惡鬥。</p>
<p>菲僑隊</p>
<p>菲僑隊（FM·U·）有悠久之歷史。各隊員均滬上菲人音樂師。如隊長唐喬司乃一著名之重擊手，投手泰山之投球，巴沙之猛擊，均使該隊實力，令人刮目相看。該隊曾於去年與冠軍葡商隊以莫大之威脅，且各員球藝日見進步，攻守俱見功夫，實力未可加以小觀。</p>
<p>葡商隊</p>
<p>葡商隊（Catholc　Federation）在本埠尼球界爲一勁旅，但在壘球賽中曾先後連獲錦標三次之多，可見該隊之實力爲各隊之冠。該隊投手湯拔拉乃全滬最著各之全壘打能手，且其投球令人無從捉摸，與捕手彼得遜合作純熟。而游擊及三壘手奧烈維拉及G隊若均出手如矢，外翼V蘇若及潘利拉均有極佳之演出。本届該隊復拉　名手多人，將以另一番作風出現於聯　中，實爲我華隊　　應付之一隊</p>
<p>武士隊</p>
<p>武七隊（Knighs　of　St　Mary）爲一新興隊伍，會於去年獲得乙組　　。本届　昇甲組，必將大有作爲。該隊之特點乃偸　及走　之迅速，每能利用他人防守疏密時，大事活躍。且該隊進攻時每多利用短擊，使人防不勝防，全隊均屬混血兒，且均年事甚輕，在本届聯賽中將必努力爭鬥</p>
<p>西靑隊</p>
<p>西靑隊（Y　Cubs）曾　去年亞軍。隊員勃克，凱捷密洛夫，奧沙遼輩均　球界之知名人士。全隊由西靑及蒙諾克合組而成。但因游擊日籍植島，轉隸日僑隊。該隊實力，受重大損失。全隊合作純熟，攻人之短。日各員均球塲經騐幾富，臨危不亂，　機　衆。該隊之短乃在擊球，此與能貓之弊病相同。但在防守因植島及一壘手岩　離去，本屈能否有如上届之活躍，將於比賽後方得知之。</p>
<p>本屆聯賽復有乙組。參加者已有十隊之多。內中如熊貓·鯊魚·蘇俄·海賊·葡商等隊均實力擊强，尤以華隊熊貓爲最强。如隊員梁友文·梁友　等。此外鯊魚隊之捕手王秀南及投手鄭漢中等均年少有爲。且各隊中好手甚多，將來此十隊厮殺，在本届聯賽將增加熱閙。現探悉聯賽當局巳租得俄體育會球塲，同時決定甲組採　循環，乙組採單循環比賽，而本届主辦者乃由華人所主持。爲普及起見，將不收門票，盡量歡迎球迷往觀，俾提高及增加國人對壘球之興趣也。</p>
<h3 id="c62">排球聯賽已展幕　甲女兩組實力檢討 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>本届排球聯賽，自上週六展冪以來，每日有比賽，逢星期三爲甲組或女組，餘日爲乙組比賽。</p>
<p>按本屆以室內球場之不能租用，故最先聯賽當局據借用東華足球場，旋以各隊因交通上較爲不便，長後由聯賽當局决定改借靜安寺路中北球塲，乃由聯賽委員王席張葆奎向中北隊領隊汪仲陶接洽，乃承汪免費租借，實使聯賽得益不淺。因上列原因，該比賽迄今任人參觀，不售門票，誠符合提倡之本旨也。</p>
<p>此番參加隊伍甲組及女組因外籍隊伍之隱約，故甲組得四隊，女組則更以上届冠軍綠隊之退休，以及季軍志　除之領導無人，乃僅有三隊參加。乙組共計十七隊，計分乙一部乙二部而組，甲女組均採雙循環制，乙組則取單循環制，俟分部冠軍產生後，再决總冠軍焉，</p>
<p>自開始角逐以來，筆者對甲組各强，女組各隊之實力，加以觀察。茲可光作兩組之大勢，並將各隊實力檢對一番。</p>
<p>甲組錦標中北穩得</p>
<p>甲組參加者爲中北。白隊·三省·華嚴四强·一週間均有過比賽，中北已勝三省華嚴二役，華嚴則勝白隊而敗於中北，自隊僅一戰負於華嚴，三省亦一仗見屈於中北。就人材實力，即未經交鋒，我人早料以中北之整齊與勁强，始可所向無敵，穩得全勝·茲已戰二次，均在輕描淡寫之下獲勝，絕無偶然。則進而保持常勝，是無疑問。致亞軍一席，頗難預測。蓋白隊三省華嚴三隊，實力確屬相彷，各具優點及缺點，况爲雙循環，變幻正多，故須視當時之努力矣。綜論甲組中北首席，二三四各不定，茲再將各隊實力檢討。</p>
<p>中北人才濟濟超人一等</p>
<p>中北隊此番原有健將</p>
<p>之外，復到上届冠軍隊粵軍之全部人馬來歸，豈僅所謂人材濟濟，即以之分爲二隊，亦無不可。照目下其標準陣容，當爲頭排李實中。麥炳堯。陳學崇，二排趙雅林·侯若愚·源秉球，三排陳吉常。黃　軍·陳兆邦。列爲後備軍者。尙有隊長汪仲陶及李震中·馬燦希·余　子。卓國榮·包松圓等大將。其人材之多，不言可　。其戰鬥力，得分方面有李賽中陳學崇之叩殺·趙雅林源　球之　擊，四人俱有致敵死命之殺手　，以故祇頻麥炳堯之妙托，或左或右，或前或後。則非特勝球而已。抑且盡欣賞之美。致守方面，頭排之鎖織，三排諸將之神勇，管稱水準以上。尤以三排三將，爲其他各隊所難望項背，唯筆者始終覺得，以中北之人材，當有更精湛之演出。是則有望於該隊以後比賽時盡量發揮，毋以穩勝而稍懈。</p>
<p>白隊經驗勝人長力部够</p>
<p>白隊在排球壇上，有卞年以上之歷史。雖屬隊員稍有更動，但大部份則均不動。如汪德元汪德餘昆仲，及程也寗王光炤謝益欽等，始終如一。旣有悠長之歷史　則合作方面與經騐方面，自屬勝人一等。惜乎老將究屬有長力不够之處。故該隊第一局比較最後一局有精神，大有越戰愈不行之感，此爲無法補救之缺憾矣。其戰術方面，得分似全賴汪德元一人。注德餘偶有作爲，但易爲人注意，吃　殊多。頭排鎖　·未見老練。三排新人陳祚良徐熙尚徐平洋三人，偕有一日千里之勢，令人刮目相看。</p>
<p>三省指導有人前途有望</p>
<p>三省即係上屆乙組之雄師　中隊之原車，僅加入國手譚水湛及健將姚文彝兩人。自本届該隊突隸屬於三省體育會旗織之下，經管理鄧效良之經營有方，故隊員精神極佳。更可貴者，該隊聘得朱戚公君爲指導，可謂得其人矣。　朱君之對於排球，造詣極深，且對於學理方面·熟給無遺。最年在粵地久負盛各。觀乎三省之逐有進步，可以恕見。故木届三省必有一二塲　人之作，來日前程，更無限量。勉之！</p>
<p>華嚴合作欠佳難望發展</p>
<p>華嚴隊爲華嚴里之一弄同居之愛好排球者而組合，殊屬難能。故歷來　者頗贊成該隊之組織，且認爲前途亦有厚望。本届之能毅然加人甲親，尤値得佩服。余在未展幕前，以爲該隊將得殿軍，惟必能有最長足之進步。距知在第一戰重，突見有前俄僑主將谷坦戈，法商靈魂喬奇助陣，此對於該隊實力，視之當屬增强不少。及觀比賽情形，則兩番將自私自利，狼狽爲奸。以兩人球藝上乘，得分甚多，所以能勝白隊，唯此而已。但余深覺其餘諸將因之而少機會，進步自爾難矣。總之，拉攏名將，以冀成績較佳，自屬合理。但應注重合作。否則必成爲個人表演。再如譚永湛加入三省一羣新人中，彼能得功之外，復　提携之心，華嚴應特別注意而改過之。如不然者，雙成埋沒不少新人材，錢家　以爲何如？</p>
<p>女組黃座三省必登</p>
<p>女組僅有三省·新本。華嚴三隊參加。初戰華嚴已敗於新本，此當爲名次之爭。致皇座一席，必爲三省所登。緣三省係上届之亞軍隊，在決戰時，慘敗於綠隊之景，猶在眼前。該隊處心積慮，勤練不已，早具必得本届錦標之雄心。酒者更以綠隊之不加入，眼中之釘巳除。踏着康莊大道，可無荊　。所望者，不驕不餒，努力以赴，始可不失冠軍　態耳。新本爲本届突起之新軍，一戰　勝筆嚴可造　之隊也。華嚴則有志騫四騎士參加，目下雖一敗於新本，但第二循環時或可展其所畏，復此一箭之仇。三巾幗隊實力如后：</p>
<p>三省處新積慮已非一日</p>
<p>三省女拼大部係前滬星之班底，實力自强。上届勝三省隊後，參加聯賽，已有必得曾席之決心。論其實力，在巾幗隊中，確稱堅硬。頭排陳梅貞之一記殺球，銳利無匹。沈梅影爲陳之老搭擋，木届因史瑞娟之休息，必以沈主二排中，則與梅貞舊調重彈。一番作爲，必勝于往昔。餘若陳榴珍·陸翠芳·陳揚書等亦皆大將，益以該隊合作已熟，陣容輕騐，均遠在其餘二隊之上，故本届得償其心頭矣</p>
<p>新本異軍突起令人刮目</p>
<p>新本排球隊第一次參加聯賽，該隊爲新本女學仝學所組織，一支學生軍也·內中除陸兆珊，餘皆各不羅傅之輩。初　臉面　倒華　，能不令人刮目相視。其頭排朱　　吳劬之兩角　殺，頗有成績。中排王務體之功夫，不像一新人，老練異當。三排有陸兆珊主持，惜兩角略弱，該隊均年當力强之學生軍，觀其初戰之情形而推測，成名非艱。</p>
<p>華嚴健將不少支配不當</p>
<p>華嚴隊得志　隊張敏玉。沈毓文。翁　淸。彭香遠四將之助陣，可謂健將雲集，決非等開之之輩。不料第一戰即敗于新本，耐人索解。蓋該隊殊鮮指導，有用人不當之處，前以彭香遠試二排，朱文佩爲頭排左·均係失策。如張敏玉可列維爾排中，較祝敬容彭香達能勝任，朱文佩應爲頭排中，沈毓文翁　淸左右輔，彭香遠三排人材。如此調度，可望有較佳成績。唯一缺憾者，將堙沒張敏玉之殺球精彩耳。總之，該隊能妥爲支配，異日遇新本時，當大有獲勝可能。</p>

<p>明天（三日）上午九點半，在跑馬應球塲有一塲福利足球賽，爲聯誼對葡商。在這足球舉節已經過去的時候，還能看到兩强相逢，這是滬上球迷意外的眼福。</p>
<p>我們可以查出，本届甲組聯賽「聯」「葡」兩隊是同居前茅。前者是兩和失却二分，後者是一敗而少二分。在最後決賽的一塲，又釀成了不歡而散。之後，足聯會淮予重賽</p>
<p>明晨足球福利賽聯誼商大戰，但是葡商上訴，又獲得勝利。因此，我人所期望的重賽，無從兌現。現在明天假福利賽的機會，同</p>
<p>明天（三日）上午九點半，在跑馬應球場有一場福利足球賽，爲聯誼對葡商。在這足球季節已經過去的時候，還能看到兩强相逢，這是滬上球迷意外的眼福，</p>
<p>我們可以查出，本屆甲組聯賽「聯」「葡」兩和失却二分，後者是一敗而少二分。在最後決賽的一場，又釀成了不歡而散。之後，足聯會準予重賽時得兩隊的同意，來一下大戰，那確是够興奮够刺激的一冪。尤其聯誼隊正在被　中的吳祺祥瞿永福　員大將，亦得到足聯會的解　，　予參加比賽。因爲他們的被　是限於有　標性的比賽，這一來，更將使球迷活躍。所以明天員坡路商，必然是紅男　女，黨鬧一番。因爲許戰的看法。</p>
<p>聯誼有了吳祺祥瞿永兩的出塲　，自然老陣容，相當厲害。唯周　麟的　滬，將由前任隊長許文　踢左翼。阿　是全材。過去也試媧這位嚴，成績相當好。所以明天的聯誼，一定可以發揮無遺。羣者會合該隊管理蔣錫離　談。據他說，這一場聯誼固然沒有必勝葡商的雄心，但保險有最想像中的演出，因爲隊員們　來士氣正盛，聯繫的很動。這樣者來，聯誼不會使我人失望的。</p>
<p>據葡商方面傅出消息，他們也很重視此戰。所以借許而茲·柯萊脫二位大將。這樣·葡隊的陣綫更完整了，可稱爲全隊都是智勇俱全的人才。盡然，他們　勝。不然的話，得了甲組錦標，也有點不爽快。</p>
<p>照兩隊陣容來觀察，葡商攻比守好。聯誼反之，守比攻好。因此我不能不期望於聯誼應利用長　。換句話說，便是應該從守中取攻。鄭英權·　永福兩個前衛，都不應該太趨重於助攻。高保正·羅壽福也應該多返陣。以七個守衛爲主體，一遇機會時，便應用球塲式的進襲，因爲高羅旣助守，一定落后，自然應用M方式最好的機會了。再有對方危險人物福恩·V蘇若。聯誼當用瞿永福吳祺祥來專司死管的方法。這樣葡商要得球，恐怕也很難吧！於是聯誼在保持不失球的宗旨下，自可尋得獲球的機會。</p>
<p>總之，這是于幕精彩的球賽。（　客）</p>

<p>Recent Accomplishments of Japanese Air and Submarine Forces over the Past Three Weeks</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on June 1st: Aviation units and submarine units have continued to brave adverse weather conditions to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and Ie Island, as well as enemy warships and mobile units around the main island. From May 11th onwards, the confirmed results obtained by the Japanese side to date are as follows: 6 cruisers sunk, 3 destroyers sunk, 5 transport ships sunk, and 7 ships of unknown type sunk. 2 specially equipped aircraft carriers destroyed and set ablaze, 3 battleships or cruisers damaged, 4 cruisers damaged, 4 destroyers damaged, 6 transport ships damaged, and 11 ships of unknown type damaged. Over 46 aircraft fields were bombed and burned. The majority of the above results were achieved by special attack units. Japanese army units in the southern Okinawa Island area are engaged in fierce battles against enemy forces that have successively invaded the area south of Yonabaru and the Shuri-Naha line.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The land battles on Okinawa, centered on the decisive battles in the cities of Naha and Shuri, are intensifying. Relying on their abundant firepower, the enemy is attempting to advance. From the 29th to the 30th, they finally broke into the northeastern area of Naha City. Japanese forces redeployed and counterattacked vigorously. At the same time, the defense forces holding the city continued to engage the enemy, entrenched in the city streets amidst the artillery fire. In the Shuri area, the enemy not only attacked from the front but also pressed in from the southeast and south. However, Japanese forces repelled them near the city walls, preventing their attacks and engaging in a battle for control.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Fierce Battle for Every Inch of Territory Unfolds on Tarakan Island; Japanese Elite Troops Launch Valiant Night Raids <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – On April 27th, the enemy, with 5 cruisers and over 10 destroyers and minesweepers, attempted to land on Tarakan Island. The Japanese garrison had long prepared a comprehensive long-term defense strategy, patiently waiting to deplete the enemy forces. On May 1st, when the enemy began landing on the Lingkas coast, the Japanese side had already completely destroyed all important facilities that the enemy could use, and Japanese residents, regardless of age, participated in the fighting. In the early stages of the landing, the enemy focused on attacking the airfield, oil field area, and reservoir area. However, the enemy's fighting spirit was extremely low, and their main attacking force, the air power, was even more weakened. They attempted to support land operations with a small number of aircraft, cut off the Japanese army's supply lines, and transport workers, machinery and technicians. However, Japanese commando units, adapting to the situation and achieving unexpected victories, disrupted their recovery efforts throughout the night. Consequently, the enemy suffered over 2,000 casualties. Since the 16th, the enemy has launched attacks with all their strength, but the elite Japanese troops have also counterattacked stubbornly. On the 21st and 22nd, they carried out valiant night raids to halt the enemy's advance. Since the 27th, they have further expanded the scale of the raids. Intense fighting has been ongoing, and since the start of the general offensive two weeks ago, both sides have been confronting each other at close range, engaged in a fierce battle for every inch of territory.</p>

<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the 29th, a Japanese destroyer, in cooperation with an air unit, located an enemy submarine off the coast of Surabaya and sank it.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Kamikaze Corps Achieve High Accuracy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency – According to a report by Hamilton from the Associated Press, aboard the British battleship "King George V": Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, Deputy Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, reported on the Pacific war situation, stating that the Japanese Kamikaze attack force has necessitated some changes in our fleet's anti-aircraft warfare methods. The Kamikaze attack force has a higher hit rate than other aircraft. If we want to counter the Kamikaze attack force, unless new weapons are invented, it is necessary to strengthen the effective use of existing weapons. I believe that the invention of new weapons cannot be accomplished overnight. For the present, the only way is to strengthen the effective use of existing weapons. One method is to use more fighters and bombers for air patrols, to repel the Japanese special attack planes before they reach their targets.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Enemy Large Warships Greatly Reduced in Number <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Frontline Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese air units and special attack units, in response to the heroic actions of the airborne troops on May 24th, inflicted extremely heavy damage on the enemy fleet patrolling around Okinawa Island, leading to a sharp decrease in the number of enemy ships. As of 3 PM on the 29th, the situation of enemy ships around the island is as follows: In the waters off Kadena, there are 35 large and medium-sized transport ships. In the Kerama Islands area, there are 2 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, and 94 or 95 other ships. In the waters off Itoman, there are about 12 large, medium, and small ships. As for Nakagusuku Bay and Minatogawa, due to bad weather, confirmation was impossible. This shows that the enemy ships have suffered great losses. According to reports, before the Japanese army began its offensive, on May 23rd, there were 19 enemy battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc., patrolling in the waters off Kadena alone. In comparison, the current number of enemy ships is less than half. In particular, the sharp decrease in the number of large warships shows the accuracy of the Japanese special attack units' attacks.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Oil Tank Type Incendiary Bombs <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Southern Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since early May, the enemy has begun using large oil tank type incendiary bombs in the Luzon and Southwest Pacific war zones. The upper part of the bomb has four tail fins, each approximately 40 [unreadable unit]. The tank is filled with paste-like petroleum and grease. This is a result of the loss of ships, making replenishment from the U.S. mainland quite difficult, hence this inferior measure.</p>

<p>Osaka, 1st (Central News Agency) –</p>
<p>The Central Japan Army Headquarters announced at noon on the 1st that approximately 400 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Southern Base, in formations of about 10 or 30 planes, invaded Osaka from the Kii Channel and Takamatsu sides starting at 8:35 AM on the 1st. For two hours, they focused on dropping incendiary bombs and carrying out indiscriminate bombing. Subsequently, they gradually escaped through the central part of Nara Prefecture. As a result, large fires broke out in the northwestern part of Osaka City and Amagasaki City. However, thanks to the people's air defense efforts, they were gradually extinguished. As of noon, it was determined that 24 planes had been shot down and 30 had been damaged, with the potential for more.</p>
<p>Osaka, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Osaka Garrison of the Central Japan Military District Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 1st that the confirmed results of the Japanese army and navy air defense units are as follows: 47 planes shot down, 83 planes damaged (including the results announced at noon). Japanese losses were 1 plane self-destructed and 1 plane not returned.</p>
<p>Frequent Air Raids on Various Parts of Taiwan</p>
<p>Taipei, 1st (Central News Agency) – Over 110 enemy bombers and over 10 fighters from the Philippine base indiscriminately bombed Keelung City several times on the 24th. On the 30th, over 100 enemy fighters and bombers also concentrated their main force on attacking the Tainan area, dropping bombs. A portion of the fighters attacked various parts of the island, strafing with machine guns and bombing the Hualien Port and Taitung area settlements, before escaping south at 3 PM.</p>
<p>Shonan, 1st (Central News Agency) – At 9:30 AM, an enemy P-47 and a B-29 each attempted to invade Shonan Island. Japanese fighters immediately intercepted them and completely shot them down in the southeastern sea area of Shonan Island. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Brave Soldiers of the Japanese Matsuoka Unit Valiantly Killed in Action <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Southern Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, having seized the Umar airfield in northern New Guinea, continued to mop up the remaining enemy forces in the vicinity. On the 13th, 15th, 16th, and 18th, they bravely advanced and launched surprise attacks, confirming that the enemy had abandoned over 140 bodies and suffered many casualties. In addition, over 10 tents were burned. The ability to achieve these great results was due to the repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Matsuoka. The Matsuoka unit penetrated deep into enemy lines, fought valiantly while surrounded, suppressing the enemy forces, responding to friendly forces' operations, and repeatedly attacking. When their ammunition ran out and reinforcements were exhausted, they charged into the enemy barracks, causing chaos in the enemy ranks, and were all valiantly killed in action.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – Due to the recent intensification of U.S. air raids on Japan, there are optimistic views in the United States that Japan can be subdued solely through air raids. U.S. military authorities also tend to encourage this kind of sentiment. The New York Times published a warning in an editorial on the 28th: No matter how intense the air raids against Japan may be in the future, Japan cannot be unconditionally subdued by air raids alone. Japan has only lost one-seventh of its occupied territories. Even if Japan's links with the South are severed, it still has a Japanese inner circle formed by the Japanese mainland, Korea, Manchuria, and North China, which can continue to fight. Moreover, the Japanese people are more tenacious and have a stronger belief in resistance than the German people. The war against Japan will be the most difficult battle, and this is the reason.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Times of London published on the 25th a report submitted by U.S. War Mobilization Director Wilson to Truman. The report mentioned the United States' determination to complete the war against Japan, which is particularly noteworthy. The United States currently has 8.3 million soldiers. Even within a year after the end of the European war, it plans to maintain 6.9 million troops in Europe. However, in order to concentrate all forces on the navy for the war against Japan, the budget until June 30th allows for the total military strength to be expanded to 3,385,000. The current naval force is only 478,000.</p>
<h3 id="e13">U.S. Repair Capacity for Warships Insufficient <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Two months have passed since the enemy began its invasion of Okinawa. During this period, Japanese special attack units have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, sinking or damaging a total of over 600 ships. In response to this damage, the enemy has been trying to conceal it from their own people. However, the Japanese special attack planes' fierce attacks are intensifying, and the enemy's damage is also actively increasing. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said when meeting with reporters on the 30th that the repair capacity of U.S. shipyards on the Pacific coast is extremely insufficient. A Reuters report from Washington also stated that the current shipbuilding capacity is not sufficient to repair the damaged ships sent back from the Pacific. U.S. naval authorities and frontline reports have repeatedly raised this issue. Recently, the enemy has boasted that they have established preventive measures against special attacks, such as: 1. Thoroughly destroying Japanese special attack unit bases. 2. Strengthening the anti-aircraft firepower of ships. Their expression of fear is proof of the power of Japanese special attacks. In short, the continuous fierce attacks of Japanese special attack planes have caused the enemy to bleed heavily. What is particularly interesting is that Britain wants to have a voice in the Pacific issue after the war. Therefore, it is participating in the Okinawa operation with a strong fleet. After its King George V and other regular aircraft carriers and warships were sunk or damaged, the remaining fleet withdrew from the waters off Okinawa, thus increasing the burden on the United States and preserving its own fleet strength. As a result, the pain within the U.S. camp is gradually deepening.</p>

<p>Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since Governor Ren took office in Jiangsu Province, he has paid great attention to education. At the end of last year, he launched a fund-raising campaign to raise 10 million yuan in living subsidies for teachers, which were distributed to the teachers and completely cleared by the end of the lunar year. Now, in light of the recent rise in prices and the increasingly difficult lives of teachers, Governor Ren has specially donated 10 million yuan to subsidize the faculty and staff of public and private educational institutions in the provincial capital, in order to provide relief and comfort. He has ordered the education department to handle the matter properly and distribute the full amount before the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – After the authorities decisively disbanded the Xiantian Tao in Wuxi, the weapons, long spears and broadswords, of its followers were confiscated in large numbers. It was decided to request the Central Agricultural Implement Factory to convert them into agricultural implements such as grass choppers and cutting machines, which would be distributed to the farmers. This reporter interviewed Vice Minister Wang of the Construction Department, who is also the director of the Agricultural Implement Factory. According to Mr. Wang, he expressed his appreciation for this move and said that the factory will provide assistance within its capabilities to reduce costs and manufacture the implements.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Measures to Address the Urgent Food Crisis <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The severity of the food problem is increasing daily, and other prices are fluctuating with rice prices, making people's lives increasingly difficult. This wave of soaring prices centered on rice is not a simple economic problem. Although the soaring rice prices originated from the initial rise in rice prices in the countryside, the reason for the soaring rice prices in the countryside lies in a failure of relevant authorities on both the Chinese and Japanese sides to conduct a serious review and devise effective countermeasures. Therefore, we have always believed that only the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese sides to conduct a review and cooperate sincerely can solve the current food problem in the Chinese-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Looking at the black market rice prices for the past three days, they have risen sharply from the 20s to the 40s. This violent increase, in addition to directly threatening the lives of millions of city residents, is stimulating other prices and tending to throw the entire society into chaos. Nowadays, everyone feels anxious about their lives and harbors feelings of bewilderment and resentment. Therefore, in order to alleviate the panic, we hope that the authorities will quickly discuss and formulate practical measures. Based on our humble observations, we offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>First, last year and at the beginning of this year, panic occurred in the city's rice supply. At that time, we received rice loans from allied military authorities for temporary distribution and sale at reasonable prices, which helped to quell the panic. Currently, the municipal government should still negotiate with the allied relations to borrow rice for temporary distribution, and the distribution price can be reasonably increased. We believe that the allied relations authorities are extremely concerned about the Chinese food problem and will definitely provide assistance.</p>
<p>Second, we are currently in a decisive battle period, and the purpose of meals is only to satisfy hunger and cannot satisfy the desire for delicious food. Therefore, general food supplies do not have to be concentrated on rice alone and can be mixed with miscellaneous grains. We have previously suggested that the Huaihai Province produces an abundance of miscellaneous grains and must have a surplus supply. We hope that the municipal government will quickly negotiate with the Huaihai Province authorities to purchase and transport them to Shanghai for distribution.</p>
<p>Third, set a maximum amount of rice that each household can store. Those exceeding the prescribed amount should be purchased at a limited price and sold at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Fourth, restrict the hoarding of miscellaneous grains and strictly prohibit the raising of prices of miscellaneous grains. Those who hoard miscellaneous grains should be purchased at a limited price. For example, it was recently reported that a committee member of a certain control organization hoarded miscellaneous grains in a large scale, making a profit of over 20 million. We hope that this will be reported and severely punished.</p>
<p>Fifth, living expenses have increased so drastically, and the common people are suffering so much. However, there are still some special classes who are still hosting large banquets and indulging in extravagance, which is an abnormal phenomenon that should not exist in the current situation. We hope that all sectors will exercise self-restraint and the authorities will restrict it in order to conserve resources.</p>
<p>The above are only temporary measures. However, the fundamental solution to the food problem depends on the mutual cooperation between China and Japan. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will thoroughly discuss and improve the control measures based on the principles of adapting to the national conditions and public sentiment of China and with the goal of simplicity and speed, and implement them as soon as possible. Time is of the essence, and there is no time to delay. We hope that the parties involved will take action quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Key Elements of the Okinawa Operation <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Colonel Matsushima</p>
<p>—Criticizing U.S. Military Commentators—</p>
<p>Major George Fielding Eliot, a military expert known for his contemporary reputation, explained the significance of Navy Day within the current strategic situation on May 27th. As a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy, I cannot help but pay special attention to this. On the 27th, I gave four lectures before the Japanese residing in Shanghai and my friendly Chinese compatriots, explaining the significance of the Okinawa Island defense war. However, the esteemed Major Eliot mentioned the possibility of the U.S. attacking the Tsushima Strait between the Japanese mainland and Korea. This line of thought fully expresses Major Eliot's outstanding talent as a military commentator, which is truly admirable. Major Eliot pointed out the Tsushima Strait, where the Japanese Navy left a victorious record forty years ago, is rewriting history. But I am at least more familiar with Japanese history than Major Eliot, so from that standpoint, I intend to make some slight corrections.</p>
<p>The Battle History of the Tsushima Strait</p>
<p>As far as I know, Japan has faced national crises twice in the Tsushima Strait. The first time was the two invasions by the Mongol army in 1268 and 1281. At that time, the actual power in Japanese politics was held by a young warrior named Hojo Tokimune. He beheaded the Mongol envoys who came to Japan, considering Japan a small country in the East Sea, and resolutely intercepted the Mongol army at the Tsushima Strait, sending the Mongol army of 100,000 and their giant ships to the bottom of the sea. The Mongol Empire at that time had annexed the two continents of Asia and Europe, and it was a vast and powerful empire unprecedented in history. However, even this vast Mongol Empire ultimately could not trample upon the divine land of Japan. The second time was the challenge of the Baltic Fleet in 1905, which Major Eliot referred to. The Imperial Russian fleet, which had traveled 20,000 miles across the wind and waves, was defeated in this strait, eventually leading to the demise of Imperial Russia and the birth of the new Soviet Union. The third time is this time.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Reports Are Absolutely Inaccurate</p>
<p>Major Eliot, after giving a very abstract description of the effects of the U.S. Air Force's activities in the Tsushima Strait, made a grand prediction that the Japanese army would be defeated in the Tsushima Strait. But this is just Eliot's logic, and I couldn't help but smile. I imagine that Major Eliot has committed an unavoidable and unfortunate error. That is: the information on which Major Eliot's theory is based comes from the official reports of the U.S. Army and Navy Departments, Nimitz, and MacArthur. However, these four types of official publications are filled with falsehood and deception, as is well known to countries around the world. Just thinking back to Pearl Harbor at the time and how the United States reported its losses, it is not difficult to understand. 1,400 U.S. ships came to Okinawa, but 80% of their combat power has been shattered. Even at this moment, the combat power of the U.S. military is decreasing moment by moment. By May 29, 1945, there were no aircraft carriers around Okinawa, but Forrestal shamelessly falsely claimed that there were still 92 aircraft carriers. Judging the situation based on inaccurate information will lead to such terrible misjudgments, and Major Eliot is a good example.</p>
<p>Major Eliot confidently states that the Japanese fleet will inevitably defeat the British and American fleets in a magnificent battle, but what does reality tell us? Isn't Japan already winning victory after victory? On the night of May 24th, the Japanese airborne troops seized two airfields in Okinawa, cutting off the U.S. Air Force's activities. The special attack units are constantly sinking and destroying their ship groups, and are also mass-producing a new weapon that can be called a mother-child aircraft, the "human bomb," which hits the target with extreme accuracy. People drive and operate bombs, flying directly towards the target. Who would have thought that such a heroic feat could be realized?</p>
<p>U.S. Combat Power Decreasing Momentarily</p>
<p>With the decisive battleground of Okinawa as the center, the U.S. military's combat power is decreasing moment by moment. When its ships are completely sent to the bottom of the sea, or flee in a panic, the overall situation of the Pacific War will be decided. I hope that Major Eliot, as a U.S. Army Major and a military commentator, will carefully observe the strategic elements of the Japanese side's three-dimensional attack currently unfolding in Okinawa, and not miscalculate the prospects for the war. The opportunity for the Third Tsushima Strait Battle is coming soon. I express my deep respect for Major Eliot.</p>

<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch, 1st: According to reports from San Francisco, the five major powers are divided on the issues of "trusteeship" and "territorial agreements" at the San Francisco Conference. Arab representatives, especially those from Iraq, strongly oppose the proposed "trusteeship" draft. Regarding the "territorial agreement," France suggests maintaining a "mutual assistance agreement status" instead of the previously discussed concept of "enemy nations."</p>
<h3 id="e21">Song Ziwen Appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 1st: According to a military celebration broadcast on the 31st, the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in Chongqing on the 31st decided to replace the Premier and Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan. Premier Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Premier Kong Xiangxi both resigned. Song Ziwen was appointed as the new Premier, and Weng Wenhao was appointed as Deputy Premier. The appointments have been formally made.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: According to a London broadcast, Reuters military correspondent John Kinsey offered the following observations regarding Chiang Kai-shek's handing over the premiership of the Executive Yuan to Song Ziwen: Chiang Kai-shek's resignation from the premiership will not substantially change the external structure of the Chongqing regime. Although the reorganization of the Chongqing government is small in scale, it gives the impression that Chiang Kai-shek's position has been strengthened in dealing with newly emerging situations. Chiang remains the head of state and the supreme commander of the Chongqing army. In the past five months, the premiership he relinquished has only been a nominal position, with Song Ziwen actually performing the duties, as Song had already been appointed Acting Premier. Song's trip to San Francisco for diplomacy, and the announcement of his formal appointment immediately after the conference, implies that Song has had some success in negotiations with the United States. The San Francisco Conference also discussed US financial aid to Chongqing. Chiang's resignation as Premier should strengthen his freedom of action on domestic issues, allowing him to deny the authority of the Executive Yuan and its ministers at any time. The economic crisis in Chongqing will certainly be significant, and Song's assumption of the position is to solve this problem. However, Song Ziwen is a banker, not a military man, so his position is certainly not as strong as Chiang Kai-shek's. Although the United States trusts him, the Chongqing army may be indifferent to him.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e27">Zhengtong Town, Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Huang E</p>
<p>Zhengtong Town is sixty li from Dongtai and also sixty li from Hailing County, and it is a large town between the two counties. The inland river shipping company's Taidong passenger ships travel back and forth once every other day. The marketplaces are crowded and commerce is booming. It belongs to the seventh district of Dongtai County, and it was formerly known as Jiangyan Town in Taixing County, both of which were centers for the distribution of agricultural products in northern Jiangsu. It holds a decisive position in the trading market of various counties, and all prices must be shifted based on the prices of Jiangyan and Zhengtong. In the past, at its peak, rice and wheat were piled up in abundance, with large and small storehouses filling the land. Now, due to various factors such as transportation interruptions in various counties, heavy losses and taxes along the way, rampant bandits in the countryside, and soaring food prices, the aforementioned prosperity has become a thing of the past as the torrents of history sweep it away.</p>
<p>Extremely Advantageous Geographical Environment</p>
<p>Zhengtong is surrounded by water on all four sides, shaped like a lone bird, and the entire town market is located in the center of the water, so the natural terrain is excellent. Whether it is east, south, west, or north, boats and rafts can navigate, and the development of commerce is also a crucial reason. Normally, the most famous local products are fish, shrimp, and wild ducks. The nearby villagers are simple and honest, and the land is fertile, so most of the residents have adequate food and clothing, and their lives are relatively affluent. The atmosphere of luxury is unrivaled in the entire county. Since the outbreak of the war, due to its remote location, there have never been any major public events. This is a unique phenomenon among the county districts and towns in northern Jiangsu. However, when peace was restored in the 30th year of the Republic of China, all local military and political changes were able to pass through peacefully and steadily, but the disorder and security were abnormal for two or three months. Fortunately, all subsequent garrison officers knew how to maintain discipline and love the people, and straighten out their subordinates, so the people's burden increased but without complaint. Since the 135th regiment of the 34th division was transferred from Pintcha to this town the year before last, the market has become more prosperous and the local area has gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Currently garrisoned in this town is the 20th Independent Brigade of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office, led by Brigade Commander Xu Rong. His military experience and knowledge make him a standout among the peacekeepers of northern Jiangsu. In the autumn of last year, General Sun Liangcheng came to serve as the Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu, and Division Commander Tian Zhongfu of the 34th Division led his troops to Zhejiang, while the Xu regiment was uniquely left to garrison Zhengtong, which is enough to show the depth of the people's feelings in the defense zone and their desire to retain it.</p>
<p>This reporter took the Taidong bus from Dongtai to Zhengtong on the morning of May 1, and arrived in three hours. After arriving in the town, I went to the headquarters of the 20th Brigade to visit Brigade Commander Xu. Brigade Commander Xu then stated his military experience as follows:</p>
<p>Organize Tax Revenue and Eliminate the Three Evils</p>
<p>"Since I was ordered to lead my troops from Pintcha to garrison here the year before last, I knew that the people here were heavily burdened, with numerous taxes, leading to a sluggish market and a declining economy. The way to save them is to reduce the burden and abolish excessive and miscellaneous levies. Therefore, after the deployment of the garrison was completed, I immediately set about reorganizing tax collection and correcting the people's methods of paying taxes, and at the same time strictly prohibited my subordinates from making demands and forbade them from going out unless necessary, so as not to cause disturbance. At the same time, I eliminated soldiers and officers with dependents, so that they could concentrate on military affairs and avoid being a burden. At the same time, the treatment of soldiers was appropriately improved, and training was never slackened. Even for construction projects, civilian laborers were never conscripted unless necessary, and the officers and soldiers did it themselves, so as to avoid causing trouble when idle. For the three evils of opium, gambling, and prostitution that harm the local area, they were absolutely forbidden within the scope of my authority, and no leniency was given. A military police inspection office was set up to check transport terminals and hotels every day to strictly prevent spies and malicious elements. As a result, security has gradually been established, order has been restored, and the market has become more prosperous over the past year. Our military personnel are responsible for defending the country and protecting the local area, and we dare not boast of having made achievements in our limited duty, but we only seek to have no faults and to be true to our own conscience."</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked again, "I have heard that the brigade commander is also extremely concerned about the revival of local education. What is the situation at present?"</p>
<p>He replied: "Since the outbreak of the war, I have felt concerned about the loss of schooling for poor young people and children of school age in various places. Therefore, I have tried my best to set up and restore secondary and primary schools in the garrisoned areas to show promotion. Currently in Zhengtong, dilapidated temples are used as school sites after slight repairs. There is now a private Zhengtong Junior High School, Changjiang Primary School, and Zhenru Primary School. Teachers and staff are given higher salaries with in-kind payments. Poor children are given reductions or exemptions for tuition and food expenses as appropriate to show preference. The regular expenses of the three schools are all arranged by me. The current principal of Zhengtong Junior High School is Colonel Counselor Meng Siyuan of the brigade headquarters, and there are more than 100 students. The principals of the two primary schools are well-known figures in the education sector, and there are a total of more than 500 students...."</p>
<p>The reporter asked again: "From the current situation in northern Jiangsu, there are crises on all sides, and there are deep hidden worries, such as the overlapping collection of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the clever extortion by strong bandits and powerful figures, the abuse of power by district and township chiefs, and the expansion of the Communist Party, all of which pose a major threat to good people. How to improve it, I wonder if you have ever considered this during your busy military affairs?"</p>
<p>Maintaining People's Livelihood is the First Priority</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, he thought for a moment and replied, "For soldiers, obedience is the first priority. Let's not talk about other things, but just in terms of the situation in northern Jiangsu, since Director Sun came to Northern Jiangsu, various situations in Northern Jiangsu have been improving. If we can be given time, then the points you mentioned will naturally gradually disappear. Currently, the most important work in the military and political aspects is to win the hearts of the people, and to maintain the people's livelihood as the first priority."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he invited the reporter to visit his brigade headquarters. The brigade headquarters is located in the ancient Shousheng Temple, next to Changjiang Park (which is dedicated to General Li Changjiang, the commander of the First Group Army), covering a large area. The brigade headquarters is currently strengthening construction work around it. Soldiers are working hard and diligently. At that time, the military officer education class was training on the parade ground in the park, and the staff, political training, military supply, military medical, military law, and military city offices in the brigade headquarters were arranged in an orderly manner.

<h3 id="e28">Director Yuan Reports on This Year's Summer Public Health Administration; Attends Press Conference to Answer Questions <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The 19th press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the Municipal Government conference room at 10:30 AM yesterday. Director Yuan of the Health Bureau attended to answer the following questions:</p>
<p>Preventive Injections</p>
<p>(Question) Summer preventive injections are of great importance to public health, but many ignorant citizens avoid them in various ways. Does the bureau plan to enforce injections and conduct door-to-door surveys for injections?</p>
<p>(Answer) Citizens often avoid preventive injections, so we requested the assistance of the police department at the beginning. We will soon be conducting door-to-door injections in the Baojia districts, so we have sent letters to the police department requesting assistance in handling all injection locations and schedules.</p>
<p>Isolation Hospitals</p>
<p>(Question) Preventive injections are intended to prevent problems before they occur, but when diseases occur, patients are often flustered. How do you plan to make it easier for citizens to know the location of free preventive hospitals?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our bureau has isolation hospitals on Changan Road, Beihai Road, Nanshi (formerly the Red House Women and Children's Hospital), and Huxi (located on Fanhwangdu Road). The Changan Road Hospital has been requisitioned by the military, so it can only accommodate 60 people. The Beihai Road Hospital has 200 beds, and the city hospital has 35 beds. The above only has a total of 300 beds, so in the event of an epidemic, the accommodation will be insufficient. The municipal government has approved the establishment of temporary isolation hospitals according to the old method, in order to provide more accomodation.</p>
<p>Summer Hygiene</p>
<p>(Question) Summer public health is extremely important. What specific measures does the bureau have for cleaning roads, alleys, garbage, and sewage, and for banning unclean fruits, vegetables, and poor food along the streets?</p>
<p>(Answer) Summer hygiene is very important, and the garbage in the alleys should be cleaned up urgently. In addition to ordering the responsible personnel to pay attention to handling it, we also hope that residents will not litter arbitrarily. We have specially printed announcements and distributed them to residents in various districts, requiring them to dump garbage in designated locations within the specified time for cleaning. Regarding the clearing of sewers and uncleared air-raid shelters, we have sent letters to the Construction Bureau and the Air Defense Headquarters to pay attention to handling them. There are regulations regarding street vendors and they are not allowed to set up stalls arbitrarily. Our bureau has repeatedly sent letters to the police department requesting assistance in banning them, but the establishment of street vendors is closely related to social problems, so it is not possible to simply strike a high note without regard to reality. In addition to strictly banning unclean food and beverages, we are closely discussing the ban on general street vendors with relevant bureaus and departments.</p>
<p>Civilian Treatment</p>
<p>(Question) Infectious diseases occur frequently in the city, and the cost of diagnosis and treatment for the civilian class is often unbearable. Has the bureau considered free treatment and other measures for civilians?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our Beihai Road Isolation Hospital has ordinary wards that are specifically for treating the civilian class, so they do not charge fees. The fees charged by other hospitals are in accordance with the regulations of the municipal government, and the medical expenses charged are very low.</p>
<p>Suburban Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>(Question) How do the epidemic prevention officials in the urban and suburban areas communicate and implement their work?</p>
<p>(Answer) In order to popularize epidemic prevention knowledge, our bureau sends personnel to broadcast propaganda on Shanghai Radio every Friday. As for the implementation of epidemic prevention work, our bureau has 46 temporary teams for cholera injections, and they are injecting the public in the urban and suburban areas every day, which is going smoothly. However, the number of injections is still only more than 520,000 people (excluding the Hongkou Naval Baojia District, because that district is not handled by our bureau). Starting on the 12th of next month, we plan to send additional injection personnel to Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru to carry out injections.</p>
<p>Testing Proprietary Medicines</p>
<p>(Question) Some proprietary medicines that have been tested for hygiene and health by drug merchants often exaggerate their publicity when something happens. What are the bureau's opinions on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our bureau's crackdown on exaggerated publicity of medicines is implemented step by step in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry of Health. Recently, it has been reported that some drug manufacturers are selling fake medicines, and once the investigation is completed, they will be severely punished.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Director of the Economic Bureau, Liu Xingliang, took office at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 1st). The former director, Xu Jiang, personally went to the bureau to handle the handover procedures. It is learned that in addition to the original secretary's office and six sections, the internal organization of the bureau will be supplemented with the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections to handle distribution, retail stores, and accounting affairs.

<h3 id="e30">Finance Bureau Proceeding With Adjustment of Brokerage Tax <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has decided to change the previous brokerage stamp tax to a brokerage business tax, and is proceeding with the adjustment of the brokerage tax in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government, awaiting the Ministry of Finance's reply. According to the bureau's method of adjusting the tax, it plans to change the tax based on the amount of sales or commission. Once the Ministry of Finance's reply is received, it can be implemented on a regular basis. It is also learned that due to the tense preliminary investigation work for the business tax, 40 investigators have been transferred to the city's various tax collection offices to work separately, and 10 investigators have been transferred from the business tax section to the special tax section to assist in the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Lost House Donation Receipt; Replenishment Fee Method Revised and Announced by Finance Bureau <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau's method for taxpayers who have lost their house donation receipt and apply for a replacement has always been based on the amount of the donation, with a handling fee of 10 to 50 yuan per replacement ticket. It has been determined that the originally determined replenishment fee standard is low, and it is proposed that starting from this summer, the replacement ticket handling fee will be charged as follows:</p>
<p>For each quarterly donation amount of more than 1,000 yuan and less than 5,000 yuan, a replacement ticket fee of 300 yuan will be charged each time.</p>
<p>For each annual donation amount of less than 5,000 yuan, and less than 10,000 yuan,</p>
<p>For each quarterly donation amount of more than 10,000 yuan and less than 50,000 yuan, a fee of 1,000 yuan will be charged each time.</p>
<p>For each quarterly donation amount of more than 50,000 yuan and less than 100,000 yuan, a fee of 2,000 yuan will be charged each time.</p>
<p>For each quarterly donation amount of more than 100,000 yuan, a fee of 3,000 yuan will be charged each time. For replacement tickets before the spring of this year, a handling fee of 200 yuan will be charged each time. The Municipal Government has ordered the Finance Bureau to proceed accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Tram Discount Method; Unsuccessful Request from Education Bureau <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the price of tram tickets in the city has repeatedly increased. Teachers traveling to and from classes are unable to bear the high ticket prices, resulting in walking back and forth morning and evening, causing fatigue. Considering this, the Education Bureau reported this situation to the Municipal Government, requesting that the Municipal Transportation Company be instructed to follow the example of military and police personnel and allow them to purchase preferential tickets to show sympathy. It is heard that the Municipal Government has sent personnel to negotiate, but the result is that the preferential military and police measures are limited to soldiers in uniform and cannot be changed. As a result, teachers still rush around morning and evening for school every day. It is heard that people from all parties will try their best to find ways for the teachers.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Special Cosmetics Tax; Increased Valuation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>According to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, the tax rate for the special cosmetics tax is 12% based on price for the first category of toothpaste, tooth powder, and soap, and 70% based on price for the second category of rouge, hair wax, face powder, and soap. However, because the originally ordered valuation is not suitable for the current market price, a meeting of the Valuation Committee was specially convened to decide to increase the original valuation by ten times. This has been reported to the Ministry of Finance and a circular has been issued to the subordinate units, which will be implemented from the 1st of yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Concealing Special Tax: Voluntary Surrender Granted Exemption from Prosecution; Finance Bureau Approves Supplementary Payment to Show Leniency <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xingchang Western Clothing Store, located at 95 Datong Road in this city, concealed special taxes in January and February of this year. Now, due to self-reflection and inner guilt, they have specially submitted a voluntary surrender to the Supervision Section of the Madang Road Finance Bureau, along with the concealed tax situation and related invoice documents. After verification by the section, it was deemed that there was indeed fraudulent behavior, totaling 186,564 yuan in special tax funds occupied. This was truthfully reported to higher authorities. The Finance Bureau has approved that since the store was able to voluntarily surrender and pay the tax after concealing it, it should be considered rare. In addition to approving the supplementary payment of tax funds, it is specifically exempted from prosecution for the portion of the special tax occupied, to show generosity.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Air Raids on Various Parts of Japan: Civilian Air Defense Situation: Talk by Saito Tadao Returning to Shanghai After Investigation <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Civilian Air Defense Headquarters dispatched Saito Tadao, a senior official from the Police Defense Department, to various parts of Japan in early April of this year to investigate the bombing situation and civilian air defense tasks. After more than two months, he returned to Shanghai on the previous day (the 26th). He talked in detail about the investigation situation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Carry Out Indiscriminate Bombing</p>
<p>In early November last year, enemy aircraft began to indiscriminately bomb various parts of Japan. Major cities such as Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and other areas were successively bombed and suffered disasters. The bombing by enemy aircraft was completely inhumane. When attacking, they first formed an "井" (well) shape, dropping incendiary bombs and other bombs, and then divided into vertical and horizontal lines to bomb, forming a checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the cities being bombed were engulfed in flames, making escape difficult. The flames of individual houses could reach two to three stories high, especially in densely populated areas, where they were even more intense. The vertical and horizontal firepower could spread to about 400 to 500 meters, and even wide roads could extend to the opposite side and surrounding areas. In the flames, tires of ball cars and gasoline cylinders often exploded and caught fire. Even reinforced concrete houses could have the firepower enter through the windows and suffer disaster.</p>
<p>Evacuation of Factories Reduces Losses: Various industrial areas made early preparations and implemented evacuation. Large factories were transformed into small factories. To prevent the spread of incendiary bombs in densely populated factory areas, isolation was added, and houses were closed off to create wide roads. Ditches were dug around each factory, and a large amount of air defense water was permanently stored. After being bombed, it could be used for irrigation and rescue, and the civilian fire could not spread. At the same time, each factory built solid and complete air-raid shelters that could accommodate more than 150% of the number of workers in each shift. Even if they were bombed during an air raid, the workers remaining in the factory could also take refuge, so the damage was extremely minor, and production was not affected.</p>
<p>First Aid Measures for Incendiary Bombs: Regarding first aid measures, most of the population in this city has been evacuated. Except for those who are necessary, 19 out of 10 have been evacuated to rural areas. However, people must be stationed in every house because 4-6 pound incendiary bombs can be extinguished by manpower. Therefore, in Japanese cities, a large amount of water is stored in every house every seven meters. Every 120 meters on the road, an air defense water storage pool is built. The water in each pool can be used for fire trucks for at least 4-5 hours. In some areas, it is actually possible to draw seawater and river water in to build small rivers for use when necessary, and air-raid shelters are being dug. Statistics show that each household has dug an air-raid shelter that can accommodate the family. There are more than 700,000 public air-raid shelters in Tokyo. If each air-raid shelter can accommodate five people, then 3.5 million people can take refuge. However, if the air-raid shelter is hit by an incendiary bomb, it will still lose its effectiveness. It was found that a certain doctor's family in Japan built a strong air-raid shelter. When bombed, the family and neighbors took refuge in it. Unexpectedly, the incendiary bomb completely burned down the place, and those who took refuge in the air-raid shelter could not escape and were all burned to death inside. Therefore, when enemy aircraft drop incendiary bombs, the air-raid shelter will also lose its effectiveness because the entrance and exit may catch fire and there will be no way to escape. As for the reinforced concrete houses in this city, if we refer to the bombing situation in Japan, they will also lose their effectiveness when the flames are intense. Therefore, fireproofing is recommended for windows.</p>
<p>Three Measures for Reference: There are three measures worth considering for reference. Once, when Tokyo was bombed, more than 60,000 citizens carried boxes of storage and took refuge in a wasteland. Later, a police station was also bombed, and people flocked to the wasteland, discovering that some boxes were on fire and would inevitably spread. Therefore, the citizens were ordered to throw the boxes completely into the nearby sea, and the fire was prevented from spreading, and the lives of more than 60,000 people were saved. Therefore, people must never carry valuables or boxes when evacuating. At the same time, it is better to bring less flammable items, and clothing should also be simple. Air defense personnel must first save lives. Secondly, when a national elementary school was bombed from the north, because its roof was made of reinforced concrete, no less than 20,000 people took refuge. At that time, the fire was about to invade through the window, so the leaders ordered everyone to quickly lower the fire-resistant window, and with many people working together quickly, they were saved from disaster. Thirdly, also in a national elementary school, which was usually a place of safety, many people took refuge. When it was bombed, the leader discovered that the enemy aircraft was going to use the house as an attack target, so he ordered the refugees to quickly move to another place, and soon it was bombed and caught fire, and the refugees were spared from disaster. Therefore, I feel that at critical times, the self-help ability of the masses is very important, and those who know it should be flexible. In short, civilian air defense must be for one's own air defense, because in times of emergency, it is difficult for others to help. The task of civilian air defense is to save oneself, and I hope that all citizens will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>The decisive battle of Okinawa is progressing day and night. Japanese soldiers, with a tragic determination to die for victory, and with the army, navy, and air force united as one, are incessantly and fiercely attacking the American mobile units, one after another. From the base, special attack units are constantly departing to annihilate the enemy, filling the area with surging murderous intent and overflowing patriotic fervor. Below is an excerpt from a notebook written by a certain officer from a special attack base in Southern Kyushu, Japan. Although unremarkable, it fully demonstrates the Japanese military's determination to annihilate the enemy, as well as the tragic atmosphere on the base.</p>
<p>Scattering Petals, Gentle Song</p>
<p>Although the weather has been cold in recent years, here in Southern Kyushu, it is already a bright spring. Even in early April, the petals are already scattering. However, before and behind the barracks, the large buds of the double-flowered cherry trees, laden with dew, are like clouds and mist, resembling a dream. In the clear morning, the warbler sings sweetly. If it weren't for the drone of airplanes overhead, one would almost forget, upon waking, that they are at war. Twenty-four hours a day, airplanes are constantly flying overhead, some friendly, some enemy. This brief moment of morning allows one to temporarily forget that they are in the midst of war.</p>
<p>"The weather is good today as well, we can continue with the scheduled attack," the Chief of Staff said to the commander as he walked towards the dining hall.</p>
<p>In reality, although it is called a dining hall, it is merely a flat house built of thin boards, only ten [characters] in size, and the wooden boards around [characters] are not even [character incomplete].</p>
<p>"Yes, we can definitely do a good job today, as long as the weather doesn't turn bad. Everyone is confident in their skills!" the commander said leisurely, sitting down at the dining table. The staff members also sat down in order.</p>
<p>"The clouds disperse, the mist scatters, leaving only a spring dream - what do you think?"</p>
<p>The staff members, lacking artistic flair, looked at each other blankly. "Ah," the commander had to explain himself.</p>
<p>"Heroic is heroic, but it lacks a sense of season. Haiku should be related to the season. Mine mentions the season," the commander said with a smug look, handing his bowl to the orderly; this was his second bowl.</p>
<p>"Indeed, but mine is a long senryu, hahaha..." the Chief of Staff laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"The Chief of Staff's is a vulgar song!" a voice said from the corner of the room, followed by the sound of a warbler singing.</p>
<p>"Commander, please come to [Omitted Characters] Team after the meal," the Air Staff Officer, seeing that breakfast was almost finished, said to the commander.</p>
<p>"Hmm," Putting down his bowl, the commander's face immediately changed to a serious expression.</p>
<p>The special attack team members were gathered around their captain, intently discussing the battle plan. The captain was a young lieutenant.</p>
<p>One Plane for One Ship</p>
<p>Attacking an aircraft carrier at a right angle is, of course, the most ideal, but our planes, like our heads, are rather clumsy, so it's difficult to do. Because we can't quickly gain altitude in front of the enemy, we must attack the side of the enemy ship. The part near the water's surface is the best place, but there's a risk of plunging into the sea, so aim for a spot slightly above the water's surface, do you understand, young men? Although the plane is heavy, the bomb is large, so we must use one plane to take out one ship! Everyone must carefully observe the surroundings and avoid bumping into each other. I always aim for the guy in the middle of the enemy ship's line. The two [characters] should follow behind me, diverging to the left and right, each selecting a target to crash into. If you miss, that's our loss. Also, when entering the attack path, don't forget to pull out the safety pin on the bomb. If you forget, it'll be a disaster! Those with poor memories should write in large letters on the windshield: "Pull the safety pin when crashing!" Even the best student who has received imperial favor will fail if they forget this! Ah... Ah - The captain's explanation seemed endless, like lecturing new recruits, no detail was spared. The team members all listened quietly, with smiles on their faces. On the sleeves and backs of their flight suits, small Japanese flags were sewn. On their flight caps, a small sprig of cherry blossoms was invariably inserted. The agile appearance of their heads wrapped in white headbands was even more beautiful than the ancient warriors in red [characters] armor. On the headband of a young team member, on one of the hanging ends, were written the four characters "Dedicate Loyalty to the Nation," and on the other end were the words "Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō" [Homage to the Lotus Sutra]. Did he write it himself? Or did someone else write it for him? I stared at the profile of this young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen years old, and unconsciously clasped my hands together.</p>
<p>Life and Death as One, Victory Can Be Expected "Will Japan still be defeated with such people? We will surely be victorious! We believe that when we are in hardship, the enemy is also suffering. Whoever can endure will achieve final victory, and besides, we do not feel hardship. Look, are not the young men enlisting to serve the sovereign and the nation? Life and death as one, this is why victory can be expected."</p>
<p>One after another, the aircraft of the attack team left behind the rumbling sound of engines, flying towards the other side of the sky. The young man with "Dedicate Loyalty to the Nation" written on his headband grasped the control stick with his left hand and raised his right hand to his brow, paying his respects and saying goodbye to those who were seeing them off. His plane roared off the ground, and I unconsciously clasped my hands tightly. Thinking of the inauspiciousness of a warrior's departure never to return, I couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>"Japan will prevail!" I raised my military sword high. (Translated from the May 3rd Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<p>Takenaka; A narrow, long mountain path, although receiving strong sunlight, still seemed cold and secluded here. Walking past its highest point, there is a vast airfield. I walked up this slope without thinking. Halfway there, a sudden thought flashed into my mind, causing me to stop involuntarily. Look at the red soil here, firmly trodden by the countless footsteps of special attack team members who have dedicated themselves to the nation. Since March 18th, hundreds of "Divine Eagles" have strode along this road. How can this not move people?</p>
<p>Sacred Path, Sketches of a Special Attack Base</p>
<p>"This little path is a national treasure. Every grain of soil has sufficient meaning to be revered!" A colleague earnestly said such a sentence.</p>
<p>It has been a month and a half since I came to this [characters] base. Under the cool green shade of the bamboo, the seasonal flowers that bloom here and there have changed several times. Plum blossoms, peach blossoms, cherry blossoms, crabapple blossoms, rapeseed blossoms, purple campanulas, azaleas, etc., are all authentically Japanese in feeling. They are the farewell gifts for the young special attack team members who will depart to die for their country in just two or three hours. In fact, naval aviators love these flowers. The so-called Japanese "tradition" seems to be born in these flowers and in the heart that loves flowers.</p>
<p>"I originally thought we would go when the plum blossoms were blooming, but unexpectedly, it's already cherry blossom season!"</p>
<p>The planes equipped with special explosive devices are decorated with cherry blossoms. On those many young and handsome faces, the [characters] team can [characters] the tradition of "Japanese Martial [characters]".</p>
<p>The expressions of the Kamikaze special attack team members are nothing "special." Since the Battle of Hawaii, the bright expressions of naval aviators have remained unchanged. Using the words "Divine Eagle" to refer to them may give a textbook-like impression, but these brave warriors do not pretend at all, they are still as usual, talking and laughing freely. When the Divine Eagles hear the call to go to war, they are even more courageous, setting off with high strides. Especially the non-commissioned officers in their twenties, who come from preparatory training, are even more enthusiastic when they go to war.</p>
<p>"You really can eat!" Before departing, a certain Petty Officer was eating dried bread and drinking soda, his cheeks bulging with candy. His comrades couldn't help but find it strange. However, he didn't mind at all and continued to eat.</p>
<p>"My mom and dad were both very fat until the day they died," he said as he ate.</p>
<p>"Hey, didn't you eat rice?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but only three bowls!"</p>
<p>"Hahaha..." Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"Today, the messengers from the Yasukuni Shrine dining hall must be very busy, because there are new people coming!"</p>
<p>"Marshal Yamamoto and Marshal Togo will also come out to greet us."</p>
<p>"Then we mustn't be impolite!"</p>
<p>The time has come, but the order to attack has not yet been issued.</p>
<p>"Go quickly, don't be slow. Also, when you're alive, cigarettes are always important."</p>
<p>If you ask them where they were born, they always like to say they are from Kyushu. This makes the Divine Eagles' patriotism even more fervent and masculine. Here, the "death" looming before their eyes is no longer dark, but makes people feel it is bright and transparent, as if they are doing something extremely "ordinary."</p>
<p>"I will shatter the history of Britain and America in one fell swoop!" The Divine Eagles all have this bright confidence. They will talk and laugh on their way to death.</p>
<p>"Dying for the country is a matter of course for the Japanese. As for names like 'special attack team,' it doesn't matter if they don't exist," said the Chief Petty Officer.</p>
<p>I see the meaning of living for an enduring cause every day at this base. (Written by Shinya Saito) (Translated from the May 9th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Solving the City's Water Usage Problem <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since March of this year, the city's water supply authority has further reduced the amount of water available by 30 percent, and as the climate transitions into the summer season, when water consumption is particularly high, it seems that the water usage problem has already reached the point of becoming a serious issue. However, water is one of the necessities of life, and we must find a way to completely solve this water usage problem. I believe that in order to solve the water usage problem, we must devise ways and means in many aspects:</p>
<p>Exchange Light for Water. The reason why the supply of tap water has decreased is reportedly because the electricity supply required for "pumping water" has decreased. To increase the supply of tap water, we must increase the supply of electricity to the water company. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope to restrict all wasteful and extravagant electricity usage. Even for the benefit of all citizens, it would not be an overstatement to completely stop supplying electricity for such purposes. On the other hand, we would rather save electricity used for lighting and transfer it to the pumping of tap water, in order to increase the supply of tap water. There are two feasible ways to save electricity: First, it is already summer, the days are getting longer and darker later. The office hours of companies, firms, and institutions may as well be advanced by one hour across the board. For example, the business hours of banks and money houses originally start at 9:00 a.m., it may be changed to start at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. In this way, not only will there be no inconvenience, but the morning weather is cool and can increase work efficiency. If it is possible to implement earlier office hours, the time when electric lights are on in the evening can be changed from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Second, tap water lacks a suitable substitute and is necessary for everyone, while electric lights have oil lamps as substitutes and are not necessary for everyone. If people can work when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets, they will not need to use electric lights at all. Therefore, when the electricity saved by the former method is not enough to fully increase the water supply, in order to obtain a sufficient amount of tap water necessary for daily life, we would rather completely sacrifice the electricity for non-essential items (relatively speaking). Even if the authorities transfer all electricity used for lighting to electricity used for pumping water, the discomfort felt by the citizens (the vast majority of middle-class citizens) is at least much better than not having enough tap water and having to endure a fine of 20 times the original price for exceeding the limit by more than 20 percent. In addition, the need for light is elastic, while the need for water is not.</p>
<p>Allocate According to Population. The usage limit for each tap water user is based on the actual usage of each household in the past. As a result, users who wasted a lot of tap water in the past and those with fewer people have received great benefits. Users who were very frugal with tap water and those with large numbers of people have suffered greatly. From this, it can be seen that allocating tap water based on actual usage in the past is naturally unreasonable. It is hoped that the water authority will quickly correct this unfair distribution phenomenon and cooperate with the Baojia authorities to allocate tap water according to the number of people. In other words, calculate the maximum usage amount for each household based on the number of people in each household. If the user is a [characters] or apartment building with many residents and no separate water meters, then how the distribution between the residents of the [characters] or apartment building is handled will be decided by the Baojia of each [characters] or apartment building.</p>
<p>Utilize Well Water. Digging earth wells and digging more earth wells is not only an important facility for air defense, but also, in today's situation where the tap water supply has been greatly reduced, it can at least contribute some [characters] to the solution of the water usage problem. Under conditions that do not hinder hygiene, we should try to use well water as much as possible except for washing food and for drinking, such as mopping the floor, washing windows and doors, emptying toilets, and washing clothes. However, I would like to specifically warn each well water user that it is absolutely forbidden to pour used wastewater on the ground near the wellhead. The water must be poured into a clear ditch to flow into the sewer. In this way, the clarity of the well water can be maintained. If wastewater is poured on the ground near the wellhead every day, the well water will inevitably deteriorate over time. At that time, unless a large amount of lime or alum is poured in for disinfection, it cannot be used. This is based on experience, not empty theory.</p>
<p>The water usage problem has reached a very serious point. The most powerful solution lies with the water authority. I hope they will work hard to find ways to relax the water usage limit.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Filling Dead Ditches and Reconstructing Roads <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Zhiming</p>
<p>There are many small river branches in the western part of Shanghai, most of which are dead water rivers with blocked ends. Over time, the water has become black and foul, and dirt has accumulated, with waste and excrement covering the ground. There are also some dead cats and dogs soaking in the water. When the weather warms up a little, the stench spreads everywhere, spreading epidemics and breeding mosquitoes. Nearby residents suffer greatly. In particular, a small river in Jinjia Lane, in the southern section of Fanhuan Ferry Road, is the worst. The terrain there is also low, and every time after a heavy rain, the ground is covered with stagnant water, like a swamp. The dirty water in that small river is mixed with the rainwater on the ground, gradually spreading, and is mixed with the stagnant water in the nearby neighborhoods. Most thrifty residents are reluctant to spend money on rickshaws, so they take off their shoes and socks and wade through the water. When they return home, their feet rot within two days. And in that Jinjia Lane, one side is the road and the other side is the river. After heavy rain, it is submerged by water, so you cannot tell which side is the road and which side is the river. Unfamiliar pedestrians and cars will overturn into the river along with their cars. By the time others rescue them, they are already soaked, and they have also tasted a strange taste. In the past, someone had proposed filling the river and building a road, but at that time, because it was a section of road built by the Public Concession beyond its borders, a no-man's land, it was not implemented. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Government is completely unified, it is hoped that the city's Construction Bureau will first send personnel to investigate the area and then seek to improve it. The river extends from Fanwang Ferry Road (near Dihua Road intersection) in the west to Jiaozhou Road in the east, directly connecting to the end of Xinzha Road. If the road is built, the stone road on the riverbank should also be included, and this road can be two zhang wide. Currently, there are many shanties there, but after the road is built, the houses can be gradually rebuilt and shops can be established. At that time, the appearance of the city will be renewed.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Re-discussing Strengthening Fire Prevention <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zuoqi</p>
<p>Since the major fires in the shantytowns of Yaoshuinong, Xikang Road, and Yuyao Road, residents of the city have realized the importance of fire prevention work, especially in wartime Shanghai, fire prevention facilities are even more needed. Although the city's fire prevention facilities are more complete than those of other cities, in the areas where the poor live and in the factory areas (especially in the shantytowns), the population is dense, the dwellings are narrow, and once there is a fire, it spreads uncontrollably. The fire trucks cannot reach the scene in time, and there is a lack of fire prevention facilities, which has resulted in tragedies. The fires in Yaoshuinong and Yuyao Road are two obvious examples.</p>
<p>If we look at Tokyo, Japan, because the roads are wide and the fire prevention facilities are relatively complete, it is easier to extinguish fires. Looking back at our country, the roads are narrow and there is a lack of prevention equipment, so the damage caused by fires is also very great. It is hoped that in the future, the Construction Bureau and the Fire Administration Bureau can provide guidance and improvement for the reconstruction work of houses so that it is in line with fire prevention principles.</p>
<p>As for the fire in Yuyao Road, the failure of the Taiping Dragon Head [fire hydrant] was also an important reason. Therefore, sand and water storage for fire prevention are indeed indispensable. It is hoped that the fire administration authorities will often repair the fire hydrants to avoid being at a loss in case of emergency. In addition, there must also be adequate preparation of medicines for rescuing the dead and treating the wounded.</p>
<p>In short, the lesson given by this fire is that it has made us realize that the city's fire prevention facilities are not yet sound. It is hoped that in the future, the Baojia mechanism can be used to strengthen fire prevention facilities so that Shanghai can become a model city for the whole country in terms of fire prevention.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Construction Administration in the Past Two Months <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jidun</p>
<p>Managing Land Transportation Facilities</p>
<p>The city of [Character] has a vast area and crisscrossing roads. After the incident, the population reached more than five million. The management of land transportation, which [characters] public safety and order, is of the utmost importance. In the past, due to the existence of the concessions, the administrative system was divided, and the management procedures were complicated. Now that the municipal administration is unified, this administrative matter is now under the jurisdiction of this bureau. In the past two months, we have strived to thoroughly rectify the situation. First, we have adjusted the structure of the vehicle registration offices. Among the various vehicle registration offices established during the Public Works Bureau era, including Jiangning Road, Changxing Road, Gongping Road, Madang Road, Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, Nanhui, Fengxian, Minhang, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming, we have first abolished the Madang Road Vehicle Registration Office. The registration, inspection, and licensing of public tricycles and private rickshaws in the city that were previously handled by that office shall be handled separately by the registration offices in each district according to the location of the vehicle owner, so as to facilitate matters. Furthermore, considering that the original vehicle registration offices in Zhongjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming counties were too far from the bureau, making it difficult to manage, and in order to unify county administration and facilitate supervision, they have all been abolished since April. All matters of the vehicle registration offices in each of these counties will be handed over to the county governments to continue handling them in accordance with the regulations. As for the vehicle registration offices in the districts of Pudong, Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, and the city center, because this bureau has already established offices in each of these districts, for the sake of simplifying administrative efficiency, since April 1, they have all been merged into each office and vehicle management groups have been established to continue handling vehicle registration matters in each of these districts.</p>
<p>As for the inspection of vehicles violating regulations, in the past, the vehicle inspectors of the Public Works Bureau did not handle the inspection of vehicles violating regulations properly. Now, after careful screening, [characters] have been revised, inspectors' service regulations have been formulated to ensure strict compliance. Since April, they have been divided into two groups, going out every day to inspect vehicles violating regulations in the city.</p>
<p>Status of Rectification of Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads</p>
<p>It has been found that Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads are municipal railways connecting the city to Chuansha and Nanhui. Because the environment of these two roads is special and the municipal vehicles are insufficient, all equipment and services are simple and derelict. I paid close attention to this matter during the Public Works Bureau era, determined to reform, and adjusted personnel. Over the past few months, all locomotives and passenger cars have been repaired successively, roadbed sleepers have been replaced separately, station equipment has been gradually repaired, and the suppression of passengers traveling without tickets has been vigorously carried out. It has now been completely renewed, the business has developed, and the income has increased sharply. At the same time, it has united with military and police agencies to assist in ensuring road safety for passengers.</p>
<p>Management of Water Transportation Facilities</p>
<p>The most important aspect of water transportation in the city is the ferry service on the Huangpu River. The current City Ferry Company, which is the former City Ferry Administration Office, was jointly established by China and Japan in 1940, each bearing half of the total capital. The number of routes that had been restored before the incident are now facing implementation due to the shortage of coal allocation, and they are sometimes forced to implement, with services sometimes running and sometimes stopping. Currently, only the four routes of Shanghai to Dongchang Road, Shanghai to Qingning Temple, Shanghai to Dongqing, and Shanghai to Gaoqiao have been restored. Compared to the past, it is less than one-tenth, while the frequency of passengers traveling back and forth is twice that of before the war. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Okinawa Island, located in the center of the Ryukyu Islands, has now become the decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War. Since the start of the battle two months ago, the enemy forces have consistently poured all their strength into the southern part of the island, the area along Naha, Shuri, and Nakagusuku Bay, and have repeatedly launched general offensives on the Japanese military positions. Therefore, the Japanese military line has gradually formed an uneven and complex line from a single line, and the battle is becoming increasingly fierce. After continuous and fierce attacks by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the enemy forces have suffered significant setbacks, and the enemy's attempt to completely occupy Okinawa Island has been shattered.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Ah Shun <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tianshen</p>
<p>When Ah Shun played with enthusiasm, he truly resembled a little general, imposing and awe-inspiring. However, the moment he heard his mother call him, he would shrink back like a defeated cricket, retreating.</p>
<p>In just a few more months, Ah Shun would be eight years old!</p>
<p>"An eight-year-old rascal still often wets the bed! Wetting the bed is one thing! But one day, he made a puddle of urine and feces that leaked from the bed planks all the way onto the lid of the chest! And he slept like a dead pig! Tell me, shouldn't he be beaten?"</p>
<p>Ah Shun's mother always had a theory after beating Ah Shun, to show that she was a virtuous mother.</p>
<p>"He should be beaten, he deserves to be beaten! Ah Shun's mother has never been wrong in her life. No one has ever opposed her.</p>
<p>Anyway, someone like Ah Shun who is not made of good stuff, will never amount to much in the future. 'You can tell a person's potential from childhood, what they will be like at six is how they will be when they are old.' He'll just be picking trash, pushing carts, definitely not made of the right stuff!"</p>
<p>Ah Shun really wasn't made of the right stuff. Even the name "Ah Shun's Mother" had been called for less than three years.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Ah Shun's father, after losing another newborn son, was incredibly disheartened. No wonder the fortune teller said that they, husband and wife, were destined to be a lonely old couple. Even their eldest daughter, Zhao Nü, if she hadn't been adopted by the Kitchen God, would have already... But as long as they did good deeds and made up for the karma of their previous lives, perhaps Heaven would have a benevolent heart and the Li family wouldn't be without descendants.</p>
<p>So Ah Shun's mother had vowed to burn incense three times a day. If Heaven granted her a son, she would also abstain from meat for a month.</p>
<p>Sure enough, in less than half a year, Ah Shun's mother was pregnant.</p>
<p>Immediately, everyone in the household was in an uproar, saying that good deeds are rewarded and that someone as devout as Grandpa Li shouldn't be without descendants.</p>
<p>Although she was pregnant, they didn't know if it was a boy or a girl. Even fortune tellers and character readers couldn't predict it, which made Grandpa Li and his wife extremely anxious. If it was a girl, wouldn't that be...</p>
<p>So Ah Shun's mother made another vow. If Heaven granted her a son, she would definitely visit the temple to burn incense every month.</p>
<p>Even though Ah Shun's mother was two months pregnant, she was still uneasy.</p>
<p>At this time, a relative from afar—a highly virtuous and dignified woman—came and pointed out the way for the lost couple.</p>
<p>"The master of the Chen mansion, where my daughter-in-law's wet nurse works, is almost fifty years old. The mistress just couldn't conceive. Later, the mistress had no choice but to go to the orphanage and adopt a child, treating him as her own son. In less than a year, the mistress was pregnant, and it was a boy... Later, the mistress asked a fortune teller to calculate, and found out that it was all thanks to the adopted child..."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"And then... Now both children have grown up, especially the one the mistress gave birth to..."</p>
<p>"Yes—Ling Di, the daughter of Granny Feng next door, wasn't she also adopted? Now she really brought a younger brother. The fortune teller said she had good luck, and Granny Feng is going to recognize her as her own daughter-in-law—marrying her to the adopted brother."</p>
<p>"Ah! This is really effective. Why don't you adopt a child to bring you good luck?"</p>
<p>After the old lady mentioned it, Ah Shun's mother woke up as if from a dream and decided to adopt a child.</p>
<p>The lucky one among hundreds of children—Ah Shun—was adopted.</p>
<p>This was a child with a large frame and very thin, covered in unknown sores. A large head sat on weak shoulders, and large eyes were sunken in skull-like eye sockets, shining with lifeless light. He had a very large appetite—everything showed poverty. But among hundreds of orphans, he could be considered outstanding—the result of Grandpa Li and his wife's two days of selection.</p>
<p>Ah Shun wasn't called Ah Shun at first. What was his name? No one ever mentioned it. The name Ah Shun came with the idea of "bringing good luck." The day he arrived at their house was considered Ah Shun's birthday.</p>
<p>Ah Shun went from hell to heaven. He went from two meals of thin porridge and a bowl of soybean milk a day to three dry meals with snacks to eat. He wore good clothes. In a few months, Ah Shun became a big, fat-fleshed kid. Grandpa Li and his wife put a lot of effort into Ah Shun. As soon as Ah Shun arrived, they took care of his sores and taught him how to address them. Finally, they taught him—:</p>
<p>"Ah Shun, if people ask if your mother is having a younger brother or a younger sister, you say it's a younger brother."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Got it?"</p>
<p>"If your mother is having a younger brother or a younger sister?"</p>
<p>"If people ask me if it's a younger brother or a younger sister, I say it's a younger brother."</p>
<p>Ah Shun was really stupid. He took two weeks to learn even these few words, and often said them wrong.</p>
<p>When someone asked him, "Is your mother having a younger brother or a younger sister?"</p>
<p>"Younger brother."</p>
<p>Ah Shun's mother smiled widely.</p>
<p>Then Ah Shun would be praised by the whole family.</p>
<p>But Ah Shun still often said it wrong, which inevitably made Ah Shun's mother unhappy.</p>
<p>"Ah Shun, is your mother having a younger brother or a younger sister?"</p>
<p>"Younger sis..."</p>
<p>At this time, Ah Shun's mother's face would fall.</p>
<p>Although Ah Shun was only six years old, he knew how to read the "wind." Seeing his mother's fallen face, he knew he had said it wrong, and quickly corrected himself:</p>
<p>"...Younger brother."</p>
<p>Ah Shun's mother still smiled, but it didn't seem very happy.</p>
<p>Although Ah Shun often said it wrong, on average, "younger brother" was said more often than "younger sister." In Ah Shun's mother's eyes, it seemed a bit "certain."</p>
<p>Ah Shun's mother grabbed this "certainty" and safely passed the few months of her pregnancy. Ah Shun also lived more than half a year of comfortable life.</p>
<p>After being carefully nurtured by Grandpa Li and his wife, Ah Shun grew white and fat. No one could tell that he was a child adopted from an orphanage.</p>
<p>When others saw him, they were really happy for Grandpa Ah Shun.</p>
<p>"Such good fortune! This child is really growing well."</p>
<p>Fortune. Grandpa Ah Shun smiled. He almost didn't dare to think of himself as a fortunate person. These short two words made him recall the past—twenty years ago...</p>
<p>A white and fat child was moving in front of his eyes, gradually, gradually... The child grew bigger day by day, from drinking milk to eating milk cakes, slowly learning to eat porridge and rice, learning to sit, crawl, and call him Grandpa. At that time, he thought he deserved to be called a fortunate person.</p>
<p>Who knew that a heatstroke would make the child lose more than half of his weight. A bout of measles ended the child's entire life.</p>
<p>The measles were treated by an old doctor with fifty years of experience, even the magic needles of Immortal Liu couldn't cure him. The child was destined to die! Sure enough, later the fortune teller said that the child was a noble person, and they didn't have the fortune to bear it.</p>
<p>From then on, Grandpa Ah Shun thought of himself as an unlucky person.</p>
<p>Then, the second child fell from his wife's belly, his face looked a lot like the one that died before. Grandpa Ah Shun and his wife feared that they didn't have the fortune to keep him, so they quickly adopted him to a fellow villager who had three sons and four daughters.</p>
<p>That way, the child really stayed. Until the birth of the third child—a girl.</p>
<p>At this time, Grandpa Ah Shun's life could be considered extremely happy, looking at his walking son, kissing his breastfeeding daughter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lively child, somehow, suffered from an illness that lasted less than twenty-four hours and died. Grandpa Ah Shun and his wife almost invited Zhang Tianshi, but they couldn't save him. They just didn't have the fortune!</p>
<p>The son was gone, but there was still a daughter, who was very delicate and lively. The family of three—plus the child's maternal grandmother. Fearing that she was also a short-lived ghost, the grandmother came up with an idea to adopt her to the Kitchen God, naming her "Zhao" Nü—so that she could live safely to this day.</p>
<p>Then the fourth, fifth, sixth came down from Ah Shun's mother's belly, one by one were carried out of Grandpa Ah Shun's hands, and finally, from the mouth of a fortune teller, he learned that these were all debt-collecting ghosts. Indeed, Grandpa Ah Shun's savings were completely spent on these debt-collecting ghosts.</p>
<p>Grandpa Ah Shun treated Ah Shun better than his own father, but he also had his intentions. He knew that he was an unlucky person, and the child in his wife's belly was meant for Ah Shun to bring good luck. He served Ah Shun for the sake of the third party, the heaven-sent son in his wife's womb.</p>
<p>Finally, the day arrived when the blessed child was born. The entire back room, no! The whole house was very busy. Almost everyone said that it was a noble son, a heaven-sent child! Everyone was looking forward to the arrival of the noble son.</p>
<p>Heaven answered their prayers! The child who fell to the ground was indeed a boy. So everyone rushed to say that the Li family shouldn't be without descendants, and the celebratory sounds shook the whole house.</p>
<p>The bringer of fortune—Ah Shun—was forgotten at that time.</p>
<p>The noble son had a noble appearance, a pointed forehead, a small round head, small ears. The most noteworthy thing was that he had two large birthmarks on his buttocks! He didn't even cry when he fell into the basin. Later, the midwife hit him several times desperately before he cried. This strange phenomenon certainly showed that this noble son was extraordinary.</p>
<p>The noble son was named Ah Yu.</p>
<p>Under the influence of "bringing good luck", Ah Yu grew up day by day. Ah Shun lost people's praise day by day, and until today, Ah Shun simply became an obstacle to others.</p>
<p>Ah Shun was indeed "disliked". His body was full of fat from who knows where, his cheeks were red and purple, his speech was never clear, he walked unsteadily, and he was extremely gluttonous. As soon as he saw someone opening their mouth to eat, he would stare with wide eyes, as if his soul had been taken away, without moving at all. These were all the reasons why Ah Shun's mother would get angry and hit him.</p>
<p>Ah Shun was not only gluttonous but also stupid. At almost eight years old, he couldn't even wash a bowl. If you asked him to hold his younger brother, he would definitely scare you to death! When cooking, you couldn't ask him to get a bowl or pass a soy sauce bottle.</p>
<p>The prices of goods rose day by day, and Ah Shun's appetite could only provoke Ah Shun's mother's curse, which was a certain thing, because Ah Shun was no longer in Ah Shun's mother's eyes.</p>
<p>Ah Shun also grew a body of steel bones, not afraid of being beaten. When he wet the bed and was whipped with a belt, if you asked him if he would pee again next time! He would shout desperately:</p>
<p>"Grandpa, I won't pee anymore!"</p>
<p>But the next day he would pee again. Such a piece of trash, not good stuff, other than beating him, there seemed to be no other way.</p>
<p>So every night we hear Ah Shun's mother's cursing, loudly escaping from the back room into our ears. Grandpa's belt sound clearly echoes in the dark air, only Ah Shun's crying sound is very small and thin...</p>
<p>Ah Shun is also very silly.</p>
<p>When we see the faint bloodstains on his body and the purple skin, and ask him if it hurts?</p>
<p>He doesn't say a word.</p>
<p>Once I grabbed him:</p>
<p>"Ah Shun, does it hurt?"</p>
<p>He replied faintly:</p>
<p>"It hurts..."</p>
<p>Ah Shun lived a life of pain forever!</p>
<p>But at least we still thought Ah Shun had risen from hell to heaven.</p>

<p>— Yuan Yan</p>
<p>In the journey of life, in the river of life, there should be ripples and waves from time to time, interspersed in between; otherwise, life is too lonely. Even if it is a storm that covers the sky and the sun, it is good to be able to enrich life and not go down a path of mediocrity.</p>
<p>My fragile life is like a lonely boat in this sea of ​​humanity with turbulent waves, maybe it will be swallowed by a huge wave, or sometimes it will be smashed to pieces by the hidden reefs at the bottom of the sea! But I will never be afraid, never be discouraged, I will steer the rudder of my soul and make a desperate struggle against this storm! Because only in difficult struggles can my will be tempered; only in dangerous battles can the perseverance of mankind be revealed. So I don't complain about the current suffering at all, it is giving me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I am so lucky to be on the scene and see the reality.</p>
<p>The suffering of current life is getting heavier day by day, becoming a powerful whip, whipping every citizen, this is also an inevitable process. Because the darkness before dawn is the most unbearable; only after the storm is there a clear and sunny sky, I want to see the beautiful and peaceful river surface after this storm.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Old Pastry Chef <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Kelou</p>
<p>The sun shone on Right Street with a cool breeze, and the wind was very strong.</p>
<p>The old pastry chef's pastry shop was huddled in a corner of the cobblestone street. Every day, he always looked at the people passing by through his glasses with "broken legs", watching the feet of passers-by familiarly stomping on the cobblestone street.</p>
<p>A college student habitually put down one hundred yuan here and took away a dime's worth of pastry.</p>
<p>"He is a regular customer," looking at the familiar figure, the old pastry chef felt a little unbearable. "Carrying such a thick stack of books every day, maybe he has to walk a lot of road! Tomorrow, tomorrow I'll cut him more pastry!"</p>
<p>The back view with patches all over his clothes reminded him of his own son, the son who unfortunately died of tuberculosis, wasn't he also going to school every day in the past?</p>
<p>A black shadow flashed, and his nimble grandson, carrying a teapot, flashed in through the door and put it on the table:</p>
<p>"Just now - Grandpa, just now the owner of the tiger stove said that the price of boiling water will increase tomorrow!"</p>
<p>He felt a little disappointed in his heart, thinking of his dead son, thinking of his grandson whose life was just sprouting, life was so difficult, and he was such an old age...</p>
<p>With both hands pressing a large mass of flour and pressing hard, he wanted to press all his sorrows, worries, worries, disappointments... into the flour, so he always kneaded it every day; but the dough that could not be kneaded was like the sorrows, worries, worries, and disappointments that could not be kneaded away...</p>
<p>The strong wind brought dust from the street corner and took away the fragrance of pastry from here - the pastry on the stove was about to be baked.</p>
<p>The fragrance of pastry attracted a group of customers.</p>
<p>A woman with bound feet waddled over from across the street.</p>
<p>"How much is a catty?" One hand was tightly holding the banknotes, and the other hand was turning the pastry back and forth and looking at it carefully.</p>
<p>"It looks like she has to catch her breath before she can buy it!" The old pastry chef thought in his heart while answering the price.</p>
<p>The woman with bound feet picked up a small piece of pastry and stuffed it into her mouth, and without waiting for the old pastry chef to speak, she threw the banknotes in her hand on the table:</p>
<p>"Weigh a catty of pastry." The triumphant look on her face seemed to be saying: "I have money to buy pastry, and I don't care about eating a bite."</p>
<p>"Anyway, she is buying a catty of pastry, so let her have a bite for free!" The old pastry chef held back his anger, weighed a catty of pastry, cut the pastry into small pieces, found the change, and then went to knead the dough that could never be kneaded away.</p>
<p>The woman with bound feet stood there counting the money for a long time before putting the money away, and took a big piece when she picked up the pastry.</p>
<p>This time, the old pastry chef couldn't hold back his anger anymore,</p>
<p>"Damn you, auntie, how much do you want to take for buying a catty of pastry?"</p>
<p>The woman with bound feet really had a trick, she threw the pastry on the table calmly:</p>
<p>"Hmph! I'm not talking about it," the woman with bound feet waddled away.</p>
<p>The old pastry chef's saliva splashed on the flour, and his grandson whispered:</p>
<p>"It's really like seeing her mother's ghost, if she wasn't seen, she would have taken it away a long time ago."</p>
<p>After dealing with these customers, the old pastry chef really felt a bit of a headache. Those customers who liked to take advantage of small things came and went in batches, they were willing to go to the street to try their luck and send large stacks of banknotes into other people's pockets.</p>
<p>Look! The woman with bound feet is arguing with Qi Xiaoqing's family again, not because of owing money, but because she bought the vegetables and wanted to get another bargain...</p>
<p>Too much, too much. Every day, the old pastry chef watched these endless dramas, endless arguments.</p>
<p>The strong wind brought dust from the street corner and took away the fragrance of pastry from here. From morning to night, constant customers took away the endless pastry, swallowed the dough that could not be kneaded away.</p>
<p>Now, he has rolled up his sleeves again to knead the dough, and the dough that can't be kneaded is accompanied by endless sorrow, Xia, , , and disappointment...</p>

<h3 id="e61">Six Strong Chinese and Foreign Teams from Across Shanghai Participate in the First Division Softball League, Opening June 10th at the Russian Athletic Association <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Last year's Shanghai Softball League, which attracted considerable attention from fans, will soon reappear before our eyes due to the coming of [presumably a person named] Li. It is noted that in last year's league, the Chinese team, the Pandas, participated, but due to inferior skills, failed to win the championship. This year's open league has already held a softball league committee meeting last Sunday, deciding to begin the competition on June 10th. This league is not hosted by Filipino expatriates as in previous years, but rather by Dr. Eduo, the president of the [likely a team name] club, who serves as chairman of the league committee, and has named the league the "Panda Cup." However, its nature is that of an open Shanghai league. Currently, the number of participating strong Chinese and foreign teams has reached as many as six. These six teams are all top-tier softball teams, including talents from countries such as China, Japan, the Philippines, Portugal, and Russia. Each powerful team is actively preparing for practice, and this year's softball season will be a grand spectacle, as can be predicted.</p>
<p>Now, to satisfy the curiosity and inform the fans, we present the lineup and strength of these six teams:</p>
<p>Panda Team</p>
<p>The Panda Team is the only Chinese team in the league, having participated in the league last year, greatly impressing Western teams. However, due to slightly inferior skills, they were unable to win the championship. This year, after a major reorganization by President E'sen, in addition to newly selected players, they have also specially hired Liang Fuchu, a veteran in the Chinese baseball world, as their coach. It is noted that Mr. Liang has been in Japan and Hong Kong and is a renowned baseball coach. His experience and skills are admirable. Previously, he coached the Chung Wang baseball team in Hong Kong and won an international championship. The Pandas now have the possibility of winning the championship. Chinese people have never sought Shanghai softball and baseball championships, which is truly the result of the nation's lack of attention to baseball and softball sports. This time, the Pandas have gathered the strongest Chinese softball players in Shanghai, preparing to compete fiercely with foreign teams. The league will therefore increase in interest, and our military and fanatical fans will naturally be happy to watch. The team boasts famous players who have studied in Japan, such as Shen Yousheng and Wen Ruixiong. With the addition of catcher Huang Yingrui and second baseman Wen Tianhua, it feels like the team is full of talent. The Pandas' fielding was praised as the best in Shanghai last year. The team's only advantage lies in its quick and steady catches, and the infielders are like an impregnable copper wall. The outfielders catch the ball steadily, such as Tang Weiye, [Name] Bao Luo, and Wang Nianzhi, and there are also adhesive glove experts such as Wang Xiushan and Wang Nianzu, who are all excellent in both offense and defense. In addition, the hitting skills of all the players can be applied from both sides, using both soft and hard tactics. Also, the whirlwind-style pitching of pitcher Li Qi is a rare talent. In short, the team is full of vitality and will surely achieve great things in this year's league.</p>
<p>Japanese Expatriate Team</p>
<p>The Japanese Expatriate Team (Crusades) is organized entirely by Japanese expatriates who have studied in the United States, and is one of the most balanced teams in this year's league. The team's offense and defense are both top-notch. For example, the catcher is a player from the most famous Meiji University baseball team in Japan. His steady catching is unparalleled. Also, the shortstop, Zhi Wu, is a student from Southern [Likely a typo] University in the United States. His quick catches and left-handed hitting are both well-known. Moreover, the team's first baseman, Yan Da, catches the ball with absolute certainty. The average hitting skills of all the players will provide the most exciting performances in this year's league. When the team competes with the Pandas in the future, it will be a meeting of strong Chinese and Japanese teams, and a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>
<p>Filipino Expatriate Team</p>
<p>The Filipino Expatriate Team (FM·U·) has a long history. All the team members are Filipino musicians in Shanghai. For example, team captain Tang Qiaosi is a famous heavy hitter. The pitching of pitcher Taishan and the fierce hitting of Basha both make the team's strength impressive. The team posed a great threat to the champion Portuguese Commercial Team last year. The skills of all the players are improving daily, and their offense and defense show considerable skill. Their strength cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>Portuguese Commercial Team</p>
<p>The Portuguese Commercial Team (Catholc Federation) is a strong team in the local [Shanghai] league, but has won the championship three times in the softball competition, showing that the team's strength is the best of all the teams. The team's pitcher, Tang Bala, is Shanghai's most famous home run hitter, and his pitching is elusive. His cooperation with catcher Peterson is skilled. The shortstop and third baseman, Aolie Weila and Team G. Ruo, both throw like arrows. The outfielders, V. Su Ruo and Pan Lira, both have excellent performances. This year, the team has recruited several famous players and will appear in the league with a new style, making them a team that our Chinese team must carefully prepare for.</p>
<p>Samurai Team</p>
<p>The Samurai Team (Knighs of St Mary) is a newly emerging team, having won the second division championship last year. This year, they have been promoted to the first division and will surely achieve great things. The team's characteristics are its quick steals and runs. They often take advantage of gaps in the opponent's defense to become active. Moreover, the team often uses short hits when attacking, making it difficult for the opponent to defend. The whole team is of mixed race, and all are very young. They will surely fight hard in this year's league.</p>
<p>Western Youth Team</p>
<p>The Western Youth Team (Y Cubs) was last year's runner-up. Team members Bo Ke, Kai Jiemiluo Fu, and Ao Sha Liao are all well-known figures in the league. The whole team is composed of the Western Youth and Meng Nuoke [likely a team name]. However, because the Japanese shortstop, Zhi Dao, transferred to the Japanese Expatriate Team, the team's strength has suffered a major loss. The whole team has skilled cooperation and attacks opponents' weaknesses. All the players have rich experience on the field and remain calm in crisis. The team's weakness is in hitting, which is the same as the Panda's flaw. However, in defense, due to the departure of Zhi Dao and first baseman Yan, whether they can be as active as in the previous season will only be known after the competition.</p>
<p>This year's league also has a second division. There are already more than ten participants. Among them, teams such as the Panda Sharks, the Soviet Union, the Pirates, and the Portuguese Commercial Team are all very strong, especially the Chinese team Panda is the strongest. Such as team members Liang Youwen, Liang You [Name]. In addition, the Shark Team's catcher Wang Xiunan and pitcher Zheng Hanzhong are both young and promising. And there are many good players in each team, so these ten teams will kill each other, which will increase the excitement in this year's league. It has been found that the league authorities have rented the Russian Athletic Association field, and at the same time decided that the first division will adopt a round-robin format, and the second division will adopt a single round-robin format. The organizer of this year is the Chinese. For the sake of popularization, no tickets will be charged, and fans are welcome to watch as much as possible, so as to improve and increase the interest of the Chinese in softball.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Volleyball League Opens, Review of the Strengths of the First Division and Women's Groups <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>This year's volleyball league has been in progress since its opening last Saturday, with matches every day, Wednesdays for the first division or women's groups, and the rest of the days for the second division matches.</p>
<p>According to this session, the indoor stadiums could not be rented, so the league authorities first borrowed the Donghua Football Field, but then each team found it inconvenient in terms of transportation, so the league authorities decided to borrow the Zhongbei Stadium on Jing'an Temple Road. League Committee Wang Xi Zhang Baokui contacted Wang Zhongtao, the leader of the Zhongbei team, and Wang agreed to rent it for free, which really benefited the league a lot. For the reasons listed above, the competition is still open to the public, with no tickets sold, which truly meets the purpose of promotion.</p>
<p>Because the number of foreign teams in this session has been reduced, the first division has four teams, and the women's group has even fewer, with only three teams participating due to the retirement of last year's champion Green Team and the lack of leadership after the departure of the third-place Zhi [Likely a team name] team. There are a total of seventeen teams in the second division, divided into two groups, A and B. The first division and women's group both adopt a double round-robin system, while the second division adopts a single round-robin system. After the group champions are produced, the overall champion will be determined.</p>
<p>Since the start of the competition, the author has observed the strengths of each team in the first division and women's groups. Here is a look at the overall situation of the two groups, and a review of the strengths of each team.</p>
<p>First Division Championship: Zhongbei is a Sure Thing</p>
<p>The participants in the first division are Zhongbei, the White Team, the Three Provinces, and Huayan. All four strong teams have had matches in the past week. Zhongbei has won against the Three Provinces and Huayan, Huayan has won against the White Team and lost to Zhongbei, and the White Team has only lost one match to Huayan, and the Three Provinces has also lost one match to Zhongbei. In terms of talent and strength, even without a match, we had expected Zhongbei's neatness and strength, so it can be invincible and stable in all victories. Now it has fought twice, and both have been won under light strokes, which is by no means accidental. Then there is no doubt that it will maintain a winning streak. It is quite difficult to predict the seat of the runner-up. The White Team, the Three Provinces, and Huayan, these three teams, their strengths are indeed similar, each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and because it is a double round-robin, there are many changes, so it depends on the effort at the time. In conclusion, Zhongbei is the chief of the first division, and the second, third, and fourth are uncertain. Now let's review the strengths of each team.</p>
<p>Zhongbei's Talent is Overwhelming</p>
<p>This time, Zhongbei originally had its veterans</p>
<p>In addition, all the people from last year's champion team, Yuejun, have returned, so it is not only a matter of talent, but it is not impossible to divide it into two teams. According to its current standard lineup, it should be the first row Li Shizhong, Mai Bingyao, Chen Xuechong, the second row Zhao Yalin, Hou Ruoyu, Yuan Bingqiu, the third row Chen Jichang, Huang [Name] Jun, Chen Zhaobang. There are still team leader Wang Zhongtao and Li Zhenzhong, Ma Canxi, Yu [Name] Zi, Zhuo Guorong, Bao Songyuan and other generals listed as reserve troops. The number of talents is self-evident. In terms of combat effectiveness, Li Saizhong and Chen Xuechong's kill, and Zhao Yalin and Yuan [Name] Qiu's [Likely a typo] hit in the scoring aspect, all four have the assassin that can kill the enemy, so just by relying on Mai Bingyao's wonderful setting, whether left or right, front or back. Then it is not only winning the ball. And also the beauty of the appreciation. In terms of defense, the lock weaving of the first row and the bravery of the generals in the third row are all above the standard. Especially the three generals in the third row are difficult for other teams to look at. Only the author always feels that Zhongbei's talent should have a more exquisite performance. It is hoped that the team will give full play to it in future competitions, and do not slack off slightly because of a stable victory.</p>
<p>White Team's Experience is Better, but Endurance is Not Enough</p>
<p>The White Team has more than 10 years of history in the volleyball world. Although the team members have changed slightly, most of them remain unchanged. Such as Wang Deyuan, Wang Deyi brothers, and Cheng Yening, Wang Guangzhao, Xie Yiqin, etc., have always been the same. Since there is a long history, the cooperation and experience are naturally better than others. It is a pity that the old generals are ultimately not strong enough. Therefore, the team's first game is more energetic than the last game, and there is a feeling of fighting more and more. This is an irreparable defect. In terms of tactics, scoring seems to depend entirely on Wang Deyuan alone. Zhu Deyi occasionally has achievements, but it is easy to be noticed and suffers too much. The first row is locked [Likely a typo] not old enough. The three new players in the third row, Chen Zuoliang, Xu Xishang, and Xu Pingyang, all have a potential of rapid progress, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Three Provinces has Guidance, with Promising Future</p>
<p>The Three Provinces is the mighty division A team from last year, the original team of Zhongdui, with only Tan Shuizhan, a national player, and Yao Wenyi, a strong player, added. Since this team was suddenly affiliated with the Three Provinces Sports Association flag this year, and Deng Xiaoliang's management is effective, the team members are in excellent spirits. What is even more valuable is that the team hired Mr. Zhu Qigong as a coach, which can be said to be the right person. Mr. Zhu has a very deep understanding of volleyball and is familiar with the theoretical aspects. He has been famous in Guangdong for a long time. Observing the gradual progress of the Three Provinces, it can be seen. Therefore, this session of the Three Provinces will definitely have one or two amazing performances, and the future is unlimited. Strive for it!</p>
<p>Huayan Lacks Cooperation, Difficult to Develop</p>
<p>The Huayan Team is a combination of volleyball lovers living in the same alley of Huayanli, which is very commendable. Therefore, the organizers have always praised the team's organization and believed that the future is promising. This year's ability to resolutely join the first division is especially admirable. Before the opening, I thought that the team would get the bottom, but it would definitely make the most progress. At the time of the first battle, I suddenly saw the former Russian expatriate main general Gu Tange and the French businessman's soul Qiao Qi helping out, which is certainly a lot of enhancement for the team's strength. And watching the game, the two will be selfish and collude with each other. Because the two have excellent skills and score a lot of points, they can win the White Team, but that's all. But I deeply feel that the rest of the generals have less opportunity because of this, and it is difficult to progress naturally. In short, it is reasonable to win over famous generals in order to get better results. But you should pay attention to cooperation. Otherwise, it will become a personal performance. For example, Tan Yongzhan joined a group of new people in the Three Provinces. In addition to his achievements, he also has a heart to promote others. Huayan should pay special attention and change it. If not, it will bury a lot of new talents. What does Qian Jia [Name] think?</p>
<p>Women's Group: the Three Provinces will definitely Win the Championship</p>
<p>Only three teams, Three Provinces, Xinben, and Huayan, participated in the women's group. In the first battle, Huayan lost to Xinben, which should be a competition for the ranking. The seat of the champion will definitely be won by the Three Provinces. The Three Provinces is the runner-up team from the previous session, and the scene of the tragic defeat to the Green Team in the final is still in front of us. The team has been working hard and diligently, and has long had the ambition to win the championship in this session. The writer also believes that with the Green Team not participating, the nail in the eyes has been removed. Walking on the broad road, there is no need for thorns. What is hoped is that they will not be proud or discouraged, and work hard to achieve their goals, so that they can not lose the championship [Likely a typo] attitude. Xinben is a new army that has emerged this year, and it is a team that can be built by winning the first battle. Huayan has Zhi Qian's four knights participating, and although it is currently one defeat to Xinben, it may be able to show its power and avenge this arrow in the second round. The strength of the three heroines teams is as follows:</p>
<p>Three Provinces have been Diligently Planning for a Long Time</p>
<p>Most of the women's team in the Three Provinces is the original team of Shanghai Star, and its strength is naturally strong. After the Three Provinces team won the last session, it participated in the league, and it was determined to win the championship. In terms of its strength, it is indeed considered solid among the women's teams. Chen Meizhen's smash in the first row is unparalleled. Shen Meiying is Chen's old partner, and this year, because Shi Ruijuan is resting, Shen must be in the second row, then she will play the old tune with Meizhen. Some achievements will definitely be better than in the past. Yu Ruo Chen Liuzhen, Lu Cuifang, Chen Yangshu, etc. are all generals, and the team has skilled cooperation and a light lineup, which are far above the other two teams, so they will get what they want in this session.</p>
<p>Xinben Emerges Suddenly and is Admirable</p>
<p>The Xinben Volleyball Team is participating in the league for the first time. The team is organized by the students of Xinben Women's School, and it is a student army. Except for Lu Zhaoshan, the rest are all unfamiliar faces, so it is inevitable to be admired. The two players in the first row, Zhu [Name] and Wu Qu, both have good results. Wang Wuti's skill in the middle row does not seem like a newcomer, and she is very experienced. The third row is hosted by Lu Zhaoshan, but unfortunately the two angles are slightly weak. The team is a student army with strong years of age and strength. Judging from the situation of the first battle, it is not difficult to become famous.</p>
<p>Huayan has Many Strong Generals, but Improper Coordination</p>
<p>Huayan team gets Zhi [Likely a typo] team Zhang Minyu. Shen Yuwen. Weng [Name] Qing. Peng Xiangyuan's four generals helped out, which can be said to be a gathering of strong generals, and they are definitely not the ordinary type. Unexpectedly, the first battle was lost to Xinben, which is thought-provoking. The team lacks guidance, and there are improper uses of people. In the past, Peng Xiangyuan tried the second row, and Zhu Wenpei was the first row left [Likely a typo], which were all mistakes. If Zhang Minyu can be listed in the Weir [Likely a name] row, she can be more competent than Zhu Jingrong and Peng Xiangda, Zhu Wenpei should be in the first row, Shen Yuwen and Weng [Name] Qing assist on the left and right, and Peng Xiangyuan should be in the third row. With such deployment, better results can be expected. The only regret is that Zhang Minyu's wonderful smash will be buried. In short, if the team can coordinate properly, it is likely to win when it meets Xinben in the future.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning, the Friendship League and the Portuguese Business team will have a charity football match, but the Portuguese Business team appealed and won. Therefore, the rematch that we expected could not be realized. Now tomorrow, with the opportunity of the charity match,</p>
<p>Tomorrow (3rd) at 9:30 a.m., there will be a charity football match at the Racecourse Stadium, between the Friendship League and the Portuguese Business team. At a time when the football season has already passed, it is an unexpected treat for Shanghai fans to see the two strong teams meet.</p>
<p>We can find out that in this year's Division A league, the "League" and "Portuguese" teams are both in the top. The former is two draws and loses two points, and the latter is one loss and less two points. In the final game, it turned into an unpleasant breakup. Afterwards, the Football Association approved the rematch, with the consent of both teams, to have a big battle, which was indeed exciting and stimulating. Especially the Wu Qixiang and Qu Yongfu [Likely a typo] members and generals in the League team, also got the Football Association's resolution and were allowed to participate in the game. Because their [Likely a typo] is limited to symbolic competitions, this will make the fans more active. Therefore, tomorrow the Slope Road business will definitely be red [Likely a typo] men and women, making a fuss. Because of Xu Zhan's views.</p>
<p>With Wu Qixiang and Qu Yong's appearance [Likely a typo], the League naturally has an old lineup, which is quite powerful. Only Zhou [Name] Lin's [Likely a typo] Shanghai will be replaced by former captain Xu Wen [Likely a typo] kicking the left wing. A [Likely a name] is an all-rounder. In the past, he also tried this Yan [Likely a typo], and the results were quite good. So tomorrow's League will definitely be able to play without any mistakes. The group met with team manager Jiang Xili [Likely a typo]. According to him, this League does not have the ambition to beat the Portuguese Business team, but it is insured to have the most imaginable performance, because the team members are morale is high and they are very motivated. With such people coming, the League will not disappoint us.</p>
<p>According to news from the Portuguese Business side, they also attach great importance to this battle. Therefore, they borrowed Xu Erzi and Kelai Tuo, two great generals. In this way, the Portuguese team's lineup is more complete, and it can be called that the whole team is full of talented people. Although they [Likely a typo] wins. Otherwise, it is a bit uncomfortable to win the Division A championship.</p>
<p>Judging from the lineups of the two teams, the Portuguese Business team's offense is better than defense. The League team is the opposite, defense is better than offense. Therefore, I can't help but expect the League to use long [Likely a typo]. In other words, it should take offense from defense. Zheng Yingquan and [Name] Yongfu, the two midfielders, should not be too focused on assisting the attack. Gao Baozheng and Luo Shoufu should also return to the formation more. With seven guards as the main body, once there is an opportunity, they should use the court-style attack, because Gao Luo is assisted by guards, they will definitely fall behind, and naturally the M-type [Likely a tactic] is the best opportunity. In addition, the League should use Qu Yongfu and Wu Qixiang to specialize in the dangerous figures Fu En and V. Su Ruo. In this way, it may be difficult for the Portuguese Business team to get the ball! Therefore, under the tenet of keeping the League from losing the ball, it can find the opportunity to win the ball.</p>
<p>In short, this is a wonderful game. (Guest)</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Course of the Shanghai Middle School Basketball Tournament for the China Youth Cup <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association Sports Department's China Youth Basketball [Likely a typo] China Youth Cup All [Likely a typo] Boys and Girls Middle School Basketball League has ended. Now, the detailed course is described, and a systematic record is made for reference in the future.</p>
<p>It is noted that the league is divided into middle school, women's, and youth groups. The middle school group is divided into two divisions, China and Learning, due to the excessive number of participating teams. There are ten teams in China, including Nanheng, Jinmo, Huhuang, Chengyang, Fubu, Qingnian, Guanghua, Xuanyi, Zhongli, and Yan. There are nine teams in the Learning Division, including Qinyi, [Likely a typo] Wang, Hulang, Qingzhong, Heibai, Zhonggong, Hubai, Zhonghei, and Gubo. There are four teams in the youth group: Baofeng, Puxing, Yongfang, and Xindan [Likely a typo]. There are four teams in the women's group: Lianyi, Minli, Qin, and Dade. Since the opening on January 20th, it has lasted for four months. Every weekend, the fitness room on Baxianqiao is full of new youth atmosphere. Because the purpose of the league is to improve sports and cultivate new basketball talents, no tickets are charged, which is very popular. Therefore, students from various schools and people from all walks of life are very crowded to watch. The competition order is excellent, the team spirit is high, and there are very few disputes, which is a rare good phenomenon in the league. The champions of each group and middle school division have been produced one after another, and could have ended in mid-April. Because the China Youth Sports Department has to move the [Likely a typo] venue, the remaining middle school group finals were postponed to May 11th and held at the Pudong Middle School Stadium on Donghu Road. Qinyi [Likely a typo], the champion of the Learning Division, was originally the [Likely a typo], because the team used off-campus players to attend the game, and it was found out after investigation, so they were disqualified, and the [Likely a typo] Wang Team was promoted and competed with the China Division champion Nanmo Team on that day. Chen Sailin and Chen Songliang served as referees. For a time, the Pudong Middle School Stadium and the surrounding [Likely a typo] characters were full of fans. The cheerleading squads of the two schools came to cheer, and they were very enthusiastic. The war situation was always tense. In the first half, the [Likely a typo] Wang Team took the lead with 16 to 11. In the second half, the Nanmo Team quickly caught up and reversed the defeat, defeating the [Likely a typo] Wang Team with 36 to 28 and winning the overall championship of the middle school group. After the game, [Likely a typo] cadres Liang Zhaoan and invited league committee member Wang Shoufang, on behalf of the China Youth Basketball Tournament, delivered the closing speech Chen [Likely a typo] [Likely a typo] awarded the prizes. Rong [Likely a typo] Lianyi team won the women's group championship, and Kang donated a silver cup. The champion of the youth group was originally the Ke Xuan Team, because the team had another team member attending the two team games and was disqualified, so the [Likely a typo] Feng Team was promoted by loss, and won the silver cup donated by Zhang [Likely a typo]. Nanmo team, the champion of the middle school group, won the silver cup donated by Chen [Likely a typo]. At this point, the middle school basketball Blue gills [Likely a typo] announced the successful completion. The results of each group are listed below!</p>
