<h3>日特攻隊晝夜出動　繼續猛攻敵艦船　在冲繩周圍海面沉毀多艘</h3>
<p>西南〇〇基地十五日中央社電　沖繩本島周邊之敵機動部隊擊滅戰，連日更為激烈，日特攻隊十三日夜亦行出擊，由出擊冲繼本島周邊之一隊報吿日：「攻擊成功」，然具體戰果仍木明瞭。更攻擊同島敵南方部隊之日軍一隊，收獲使敵三處起火之戰果。十四日午後攻繫冲繩本島東方敵機動部隊，使敵一艦吐黑烟，一艦起火，同日出繫之另一隊日軍，擊毀敵大型航空母艦一艘，並使之起火，其他艦種不明二艘，更予相當損害，於奄美大島南方洋面，確認火柱九支。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地十五日中央社電　日航空部隊十二日傍晚猛攻冲繩島近海之敵艦船羣，擊沉其巡洋艦兩艘，擊傷戰艦兩艘，入晚，又在該島東方海面捕捉敵艦隊，加以猛擊，擊傷艦種未詳之軍艦五艘，更在南方海面襲擊敵艦羣，使其十一艘起火燃燒，並擊沉其中五艘。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　美聯社電，美海軍部十三日對記者團發表內容如次：「日神風特攻隊之勇敢攻擊，確認始於半載前，菲島雷伊泰作戰當時，其後仁牙因灣，硫黃島，冲繩等，每於登陸作戰時，日軍特攻隊對美國艦艇之攻擊凄絕無比」云云。</p>
<h3>冲繩臨决戰階段　日軍精銳隊大反攻中</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　敵軍在冲繩本島南部西岸登陸後，以陸上作戰稍獲進展，乃一舉突進，企圖衝入南部日軍主要陣地，惟受日軍猛力攻擊，敵軍挺進一度陷於停頓，於是另謀進路，出動大批運輸船，使入嘉手納　海面，積極接濟後方，充實第一綫力量。並為　開戰局，以運輸船數十艘等艦艇使入中城　，伺機出動，惟受日軍堅固陣地之阻遏，僅能在津堅島登陸，其後即　增加兵力，企圖　築大口徑砲陣地，七日復在名護灣登陸，企圖在北方鞏固立足點，並與神山島敵軍機築重砲陣，以及戰艦，巡洋艦集團機動部隊之蠢動互相呼　，以謀消耗日軍主要陣地之力量。日軍神風　攻隊以及陸·海航空部隊，水上部隊，於五日以後同時開始攻擊，日夜猛攻，自本戰役開始以來，已查明盤沉擊毀敵艦船三百二十六艘，敵方受此空前痛　後，乃出動艦上機來　　島一帶，七日敵機前後共計約三百架，八日五百數十架，十一日三百架。該時期內一部份因氣候關係，敵方攻勢似呈不安定·本島四周艦船集團亦逐見減省，十一·十二日連戰艦等僅數艘而已。敵機動部減，但敵軍自開始進攻冲繩島以來，已調數萬兵員登陸，此次冲繩作戰已無化　良間列島，神山島，津堅島及冲繩本島等佔據地區，以謀確保陸上砲隊，重砲陣地及陸上航空基地。在本島北部，中部兩飛機塲方面，已有B24型及小型敵機活動，此種動向不容忽視，惟在敵空母·戰艦，巡洋艦集團被消滅以前，敵方果能確保陸上砲台，飛機塲，或彼日軍將其空母，戰艦，巡洋艦全軍殲減，關係整個戰局。但能決定局勢者，厥為雙方航空勢力之强弱，冲繩決戰之戰旗已揭起，在本島南部主要陣地嚴陣以待之日軍陸上精銳部隊，已於十二日傍晚起開始大反攻，日航空部隊亦對北部，中部兩機塲之敵機猛加痛擊，今日戰局已屆最嚴重階段，無論日·美雙方，凡前綫後方稍有猶豫或遲緩者，必失敗無疑</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據關島來電，尼米資司令部十四日發表謂：冲繩島美第二十四兵團部隊，十三日未曉擊退日軍之猛烈反攻。又據美聯社記者報吿，美軍第二十四兵團連續八日未能前進一步，可知冲繩烏南部地上戰爭之如何激烈矣，在此戰區為太平洋最大之砲戰，尤以十三日為第十一日</p>
<h3>交通銀行辦理農貸實况</h3>
<p>— 劉豐</p>
<p>為明瞭農村貸款之辦理實況，記者奉派前往辦理農貸工作成績最佳之交通銀行，得晤負責推進該項工作之該行農業經濟處長張奏農先生，張先生為農村經濟專家，承详吿該行舉辦農貸之情形，並提供辦理農貸應任意之要點多項，特分誌如下：</p>
<p>農貸不以營利為目的</p>
<p>交通銀行於三十一年九月復業以後，即派員分赴蘇，浙，皖三省調查農村經濟實况，訂定辦理農業金融業務之方針，計有改善農村經濟狀况，　導農民樹立自營，自有，自享之金融制度與金融機構，扶掖樹立自耕農，增加農業生產量，並協助農業改進與推廣等項。於卅二年五月五日在總行添設農業經濟處，暫以蘇浙皖三省，京滬兩特別巿為業務區域，並先後於嘉興，蘇州，南京，上海，無錫，東台等地分設農業經濟辦事處，指導各地農業，辦理貸款投資等事宜，會計完全獨立，業務不以營利為目的，遇有盈餘則列作農業金融業務基金，以之擴充業務及減低貸款利率之用。其業務基金及初期營運資金由該行劃撥，後業務擴充不敷應用，乃於卅三年四月向中儲行借款一萬萬元。</p>
<p>農貸對象·區域·數目</p>
<p>農村增產貸款，原指定以農村合作組織為貸款對象，後因種種困難，乃改對農民個人貸款。又為推進此項貸款，經與有關當局及銀行，農塲等團體分別簽訂合同推進業務，截至最近貸款予農民個人之區域及於江蘇省之鹽城，東台，江寗，鎭江，金　，無錫，吳縣，崑山，常熱，太倉，吳江，松江，南滙，奉賢，申江，靑浦等縣，並南京，上海巿郊及浙江之嘉興，嘉善，海寗，杭縣等地農村，增產貸款累計六七五四戶。於三十三年一月間，每戶借款限額不過三千元，後因物價上漲漸增為五千元，近又增至每戶二萬元，借款期限則視主要農作物收獲時期為標準，農民借款又規定只須舖保，如覓保困難，可由借款農民十餘人相互連環擔保，一概不收田單或其他抵押品，使貸款得以惠及貧戶與小佃農，但對於貸款申請人是否眞正經營農田之誠實農民，與有無借款之必要，則事先嚴密詳確調查。放款時並由該行派員直接放與農民，其有轉貸關係者，亦由該行派員蒞塲監放。以昭愼重，而杜流弊。</p>
<p>農貸意義農民普遍認識</p>
<p>交通銀行辦理農業金融業務以來，已將兩年，在各種困苦環境中，慘淡經營，不屢推進，區域晶廣，貸款額達一萬萬六百餘萬元，但開支極省，且工作人員，無論嚴多　暑，路途遠近，旅費多寡，治安良否，而此深入農村，逐戶調查農家經濟狀況，直接發放貸款，每日平均最少二三十人，業務發展之速，實出乎意料。然於推行貸款之初，申請貸款之農民實寥寥無幾，梵皆恐於負擔借款利息與到期還款之義務外，尚另有他種負擔，故意存觀望，裹足不前。後經少數農民嘗試，認為該行貸款純屬善意行為，其他鄉人始敢接踵而來，風聲所及北自穌北之盬城，南至浙江之杭縣，申請貸款者絡繹不絕，故在該行貸款區域內，雖窮鄉僻壤中皆知有「交通銀行辦理農貸」之事。各地政府官署，民衆團體，銀錢業等代表農民轉請該行在各該地辦理貸款之函牘，更如雪片飛來。農民個人借款，不獨皆將本息淸還，而且多在到期前腹約還款，極少過期，更絕無拖欠者，可見在此非常時期中，農村放款並不若理想之不安全，農民之信用程度，比之都市並無遜色。</p>
<p>農貸對於農業增產之關係</p>
<p>如就交通銀行整個貸款業務所收實效而言，與其謂為協助增產，不如視為協助再生產，際此物價指數日高，貨幣購買力日弱之時，農田去歲秋收每畝農產品所得之代價，即已不數本年春季再生產同樣農作物一畝之成本，況日用品等價格上漲之速率，又超過一般農產品之上，加以重重苛捐雜稅，與抑價征收農產品等事，農民往往被迪將農產品抑於合理價格之下，忍痛犧牲，是以每因缺乏肥料，種籽，農具，耕牛，工資而致產量遞減，甚至拋棄土地任其荒蕪，可見農民即欲從事再生產，已難乎其難，遑論增產。自經交通銀行舉辦貸款以後，農民得以購買其所缺乏之肥料，修理添置其農具，支付其灌溉收獲之工資，除避免「賣靑」之挖肉補瘡之畸形現象發生外，並可遲延其出售農產品之時日，以待善價，而資換取其所需要之肥料，農具等，俾得從事再生產，故其收效至為宏大。</p>
<p>張奏農先生提供意見</p>
<p>辦理農貸專家及有經騐之人材，固不可少，但對農村工作有堅定興趣之中下級工作人員，尤不可忽視。</p>
<p>交行所辦者為貸款還款，如貸款歸還半數以實物，則將來秋收時米價各地不同，分量上亦易生流弊，故廉潔問題至堪注意。</p>
<p>各種細則之擬訂，表格之設計，在在需時，故應注重爭取時間；蓋春耕已屆，貧農需款頗殷，應力謀迅速，並避免種種周折。</p>
<p>以直接貸與農民為上，鄕鎭長及保甲組織未盡可靠，調查時亦須防止發生流弊。</p>
<p>農民對農貸工作，最初多不信任，而存觀望心理，故工作人須進行耐心地說服工作。</p>
<p>農貸區以產米區為對象固圭，但農區不可太零碎以免調查困難。</p>
<p>最好政府保本保息，以增加人民之信任心。</p>
<h3>瓦城南方激戰　日軍邀擊中　企圖南下敵軍已被阻</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　緬甸方面日軍部隊自撤離臘戍後，緬甸戰局展開新局面，現在戰綫自瓦城以迄仰光間滇緬公路一帶，刻正於瓦城南方激戰中。敵新編第一軍侵入臘戍西　後，五十師在　戍南方　西孟薩方面，英第三十六師團在蒙棉德方而進出。在瓦城地區第三十三軍企圖南下，第四軍從梅克迭拉方面南下，日軍部隊已完成整頓戰綫，重新配備，加以奮勇邀擊，同時沿伊洛瓦底河岸從寗格方面南下之敵軍，呼應梅克迭拉方面之攻勢，企圖進犯愛納喬，日軍部隊繼續反擊，粉碎敵軍轉鋒之企圖。</p>
<p>緬甸前線基地十五中日央社電　緬甸戰局中心，自瓦城達仰光間滇緬公路漸次向南移動，敵軍於雨季前，繼續增援部隊於公路一帶，由臘戍西撲方面逐次推進，與新編第一軍沿伊洛瓦底河企圖向愛奈喬方面南下，與左右兩翼作戰相互呼應，臘戍方面敵軍已把握臘戍、瓦城間之公路，而敵新編第一軍更驅餘勢，沿拉加公路南下，目下已侵入馬其依（臘戍東南方七十公里），完成預定轉進，然遭日軍守備隊之邀擊，敵推進已受阻，此方面之敵勢，顯著漸呈緩慢化。自三月一日至二十日期間，日軍予敵之損害，計棄屍一·三二一具，又侵入梅克迭拉附近之敵有力部隊，目四月三·四日來，開始新攻擊，與侵入塔其（梅克迭拉東方）以戰車約七十輛為先導，從波要波愛獨方面向南推進，至十日敵進出於亞曼生（梅克迭拉東南方一百十公里）地區，日軍駐在部隊，於該地區之東·西·南三方而，續行痛烈反擊，已予敵甚大損害。梅克迭拉南方之開豁地帶，自緬甸作戰開始以來，凄絕激鬥未會間斷，一方沿伊洛瓦底河岸自尼亞枯方面南下之敵，企岡侵入愛奈喬方面，日軍刻於塞枯批（尼亞枯西南三十公里）沿基烏自獨線布陣，繼續　列斗反攻勇戰，粉碎敵南進之企圖。又四日軍主力乘敵之虛，突擊敵之後方基地批皮，破壞敵運貨卡車五輛，炸毀汽油集積所二處，彈藥集積所二處，幕舍五十所，確保西南海岸方面日溪·刺馬來島，此方面之敵，於今春以來，侵入刺馬來島對岸之海岸地帶，敵軍更以一部，於三月下旬以來，漸次進出塔加坡地區，現於阿拉姆·塔加坡（日溪東南百二十公里）進出，以圖推進，日軍精銳部隊對此已加痛擊，並予極大損害，且轉向東方高地旣設陣地，隨處予以猛烈反擊，阻止後方進出之敵軍。</p>
<h3>襲日本土之敵機十月來損失重大</h3>
<p>中央社訊　去年六月十六日，敵美B29型轟炸機首次空襲日本本土九州北部以來，至今日適為十個月，據此間海軍報道部根據日本大本營之發表及其可靠资料，調查敵機行動結果，知悉日本制空部隊已將來　日本之敵機在此十個月間總數三千七百十二架中，擊落其四百六十八架，擊傷其九百二十九架。三月中旬敵機四次來襲日本時，有三十架被迫降落硫黃島，以此事實推察，上述受傷敵機中，至少有半數在歸還途中隊落海中，殆無疑義。因此過去十個月間敵B29型機之損大數，實不下九百架，以此數字為基礎，計算人員興物資之損失，則假定B29型機之乘員為十人，則共九千人，每機造價為六十萬元美金，則共失七萬二千萬元美金矣。因敵機施行無差別之盲炸，日方損害固非絕少，然敵方之損失更為重大。敵方於去年年底發表，B29型機生產數量，每月一百三十五架，以此數字推算，過去一年間之生產數量則約達一千二百或三百架，而以每機飛襲平均最多四次，即被日方擊落或擊傷，敵方因補給上之困難，現在停止由印度或中國內地出擊日本之計劃，而專由馬里亞納基地起飛來襲。然據美聯社十四日關烏電稱，敵軍第二十一轟炸隊司令魯米聲稱，攻繫日本尚要更多之B29型機，足證B29型機空襲日本，其消耗量之如何重大也亦極重要，實有自北包圍柏林之企圖，其戰略上之目的，顯欲與蘇軍在斯丹丁會師。在巴伐利里區之發展，亦已趨顯明，美國自胡茲堡區向拜里夫區推進，此路巴頓將軍之部隊是否東進，以圖抵達布拉格（舊捷克首都），抑轉向東南方面前進，以圖通過紐倫堡·佛爾特·萊根斯堡，則仍未能決定，因此蘇軍托布興元帥在維也納之左翼已通過聖波爾坦，向林資·萊斯根堡西推，故其向東南推進亦有其可能性。</p>
<h3>日稔彥王調任　軍事參議官</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日陸軍省十五日發表，調任防衛司令官東久邇宮稔彥王殿下為軍事參議官，按稔彥王殿下畢業陸軍大學後，歷任士官學校步兵第三聯隊長，第五旅團長，參議本部，第二，第四師團長，軍事參議官兼防空本部長等職，昭和十六年就任防衛總司令官，中日事變發生時，在漢口一役建樹煊赫功勳。</p>
<h3>美軍迫近柏林　僅二十公里　蘇軍大攻勢完成準備</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據　森堡廣播：傳美軍坦克車前鋒現已抵達距柏林二十公里地點、然美軍當局尙未證實此事。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電德國社訊，軍息：美坦克　先鋒隊於週五由北方侵入班堡市（Bamburg）之東部，里格尼茲河區正發生激戰，德摩托化後備隊已包圍敵軍，並將其大部分殲減。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　德國社訊，蘇軍在東綫福特與庫斯特林地區，已完成其再作大規模攻擊之準備，大規模之作戰將隨時展開，蘇軍現方清除德軍之埋雷區，以便其裝甲部隊向西推進。</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　海通社訊：巴頓軍之向契尼茲區推進，乃值特別任意之事實。反軸心最高指揮部之目的，係欲提早實現其與進抵西里西亞之蘇軍哥尼夫部隊會師，而森遜將軍自瑪格特堡進向易北河區及自維頓柏格進入勃籣登堡省之行動，</p>
<h3>羅斯福殯禮　在白宮舉行　反軸心國派代表參加</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　海通社訊，華成頓息：羅斯福總統昨在白宮舉行殯禮時，與美國維特外交關係之各國政府，均派代表參加。此外更有自海外專程前來之貴賓，如英外相久登·加拿大總督阿德隆伯爵·沙地阿刺伯親王·希臘外長索希亞諾普洛斯·比外長·現在美國之重慶行政代理院長兼外長朱子文（代表蔣介石將軍參與殯禮）·重慶時美大使魏道明·法駐美大使波納特·蘇聯大使格洛米柯。其他參與殯禮之外交官，有英駐美大使哈里法克斯·比國大使薛爾佛克洛斯·以及波蘭·挪威·荷蘭·瑞典等各國外交官員，均服免禮服參與殯禮。</p>
<h3>蘇聯派莫洛托夫出席舊金山會議</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>從速組織上海巿農貸銀團</h3>
<p>農村與都市有不可分離的關聯性，目前農村經濟之袋頹，足使邵市人民及產業界蒙受嚴重影響，上海自不能例外。換言之，農業生產減少，都市人民所需之食　，工業所謂之原料，取給隨之減少。於是，直接影響於都市人民的生活與工業生產的能率。因此，舉辦大規模之挽救農村經濟工作，確為當務之急。目前木市游資龐大，如無正當出路，徒為投機暴利之工具，危害社會經濟。而挽救農村經濟工作，目前最切要之方法，厥為舉辦農業貸款，解除農民高利貸之痛苦。如以上海的　資舉辦農業貸款，則上海游資有了正當出路，不再為擾亂市塲的投機工具，不但消減都市經濟的畸形現象，同時，挽救了農村經濟的衰頹病態。而其最後目的，則為促進農業增產，使都市人民的食糧需要，工業生產的原料需要，均能因而增加以至滿足。所以，以上海游資舉辦農業貸款，一方面是挽救農村經濟，同時，也就是健全　市本身經濟；換句話說，救人亦即救己。</p>
<p>農貸工作幷不是新奇的創舉，過去行之已久。最近兩年來交通銀行在蘇浙各縣辦理農貸，成績極佳。今天本報發表的「交通銀行辦理農貸實況」一文，可見農民需要貸款的殷切，以及農貸對於增產的關係。因此，我們更感農業貸款工作實有從速推進的必要。茲就交行辦理農貸經騐，今後辦理農貸應加注意之點申說如次：</p>
<p>農民對於貸款，其初抱具觀望態度，申請者　寥無幾·後經少數農民嘗試，結果認為經屬善意行為，於是相率而來，形成雖窮鄉僻壞，亦知有交行農貸之事。由此可知農貸意義在農村中已有普）遍認識，今後舉辦，不必再做宣傳工作，隨時即可着手辦理。</p>
<p>農民　還貸款，均能如期如約，可見農貸在農民羣中已經樹立優良信譽，農民對之也忠實　約，這在今後辦理農貸工作上減能少許多困難，而得充分運用資金之保證。</p>
<p>各地農民，年來因苛捐雜稅負擔重重，資金短少，於是，在農作生產上必要的種籽，肥料等等，不能充分取得·影響生產效率。同時，因須取得種籽肥料，而有出賣靑苗的挖肉補瘡之舉，並受高利貸的痛古。有了農貸，可以換取生產上必要工具、並避免賣靑及高利貸。因此，農貸直接有助於農業增產，毫無疑義</p>
<p>交通銀行在無省監城等十餘縣，浙省嘉興等四縣，上海市屬南滙等數縣，辦理增產貸款共六七五四戶，即以上述區域農民總戶數與貸款戶數比較，可見受貸農戶比數極少，也就是受到農貸之惠者為數不多。今後上海亟應組織貸款銀團辦理農貸，擴大範圍，推廣區域，使各地農民能普遍受惠。</p>
<p>交行貸給農民每戶款數，自三十三年一月間之三千元，增至最近之二萬元，如依目前物價情形，尚須提高貸額。而交行全部農貸資金僅一萬萬餘元，自屬捉襟見肘，不數運用。今後如須推廣區域，則需款史鉅，勢非由大規模銀團籌集大量資金不可。</p>
<p>我們曾在木月六日社評中，諭列取締投機與導引游資並進，主張取締投機，必先蔣投機工具之　資，使之流向農村，應以金融界為中心，從速組織上海市農村貸款銀團，先向江蘇省產米區辦理農業貸款。現在看到交通銀行兩年來辦理農貸的實况，更覺有從速推進之必要，願常局與民間關係方而亟起圖之。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>農村貸款的具體化</h3>
<p>為防止上海方面游資的妄動，而導其走向生產起見，農村貸款的問題已被提了出來。此舉可以同時挽救上海經濟及地方經濟，實為一舉二得的方策，大可注意。</p>
<p>上海的游資，今已失去正常出路，羣趨投機囤積，此為大家都已知道的事實。化游資為生產資本，乃是上海經濟最大的課題，彰彰明甚，無俟論列。然而，化游資為生產資本，却是一件易說難行的事。游資的發生，其本身即因生產蕭條所致，故以恢復生產云云作其對策，未免有本末顛倒之嫌。因此，現在的游資對策，當然非另選新的方策不可。如農村貸款者，可謂最得當的對策。</p>
<p>農村如何需要生產資金，凡與農民接觸者、無不一致承認，而且，一觀高利資本在農村跋扈的情形，亦可瞭然。農村利息半期即達一角，而且須以實物支付，此一事實殊足表明農村金融如何枯竭，農民之於生產資金如何需要。此時尚有數十億的資金流入農村而成為農民的生產資金，對於農業增產的貢獻固無論，就是對於克服農村的社會禍患，也可完成極重要的工作。將都巿中發生的害作用之　資用於農村，使積建設性的效果，即為農村貸款重大意義之所在</p>
<p>首先提出農業貸款而擬移諸實踐者，以上海市政諮詢委員會為主體。我們對於該會各委員熟心提出這個問題，深表敬意，導上海的游資走向不斤斤於利潤的農業金融，決非易事。在今後實踐時，其困難自將隨時發生。至如農民歸還貸款，一半以實物充之，也是充分考慮投資方面立塲的方策，希望米統會及其他機關正確認識此點，充分協助。農業貸款的原則固然可行，但在技術方面使之減少困難，則有待於各方面的恊力。故各方以恊助的態度使此貸款實現，尤為我人所翹望。</p>
<p>農業貸款苟能實現，上海游資倘能具體貢獻於農業生產，則中國戰時經濟體制可以强化到什麼程度，今日是無從估量的。同時，也可根本芟除以上海為淵藪的投機分子的活動，以及以農村為其地盤的高利貸資本的禍患，此對中國社會的健全化，可有很大的貢獻。我們希望農業貸款的提倡者排除萬難，底之於成。（四月十五日大陸新報社論）</p>

<p>周兼司令行舉手禮</p>
<h3>顧兼秘書長詞</h3>
<p>今天是上海特別市自警團模範隊員舉行春李檢閱，承蒙兼團長及各位長官，在政務繫忙中躬親蒞臨，使我們全體同志深深感到興奮。</p>
<p>本巿的自　團，過去是在倉促間宣吿成立的；雖然自警團同志們在各個不同的組織與機構下，為地方職務，盡了許多責任，建立了許多功績，但是，我們從整個看來，沒有統一的組織和訓練，自警團還是不能發揮更大的力量。</p>
<p>精神統不斷自檢</p>
<p>自警團團本部因為環境的為要，已於去年九月九日，宣吿成立，開始了統一的組訓工作，使各地區自警團的編制調整，同時將地們連繫起來，漸漸成了新的氣象。</p>
<p>關於各區自警團員的改編整理工作，現在憶經粗粗的吿一段落，至少我們在精神上已吿統一，在服裝及一切設施的問題，亦正逐步調整中，我希望每一同志、都有團結一致的自信。</p>
<p>服務人羣保衛上海</p>
<p>在自警同志中，有不少優秀份子，尤其我們幹部同志巾，有許多資歷深厚的各軍校同學，他們不求名利，埋頭苦幹，為地方服務，協力警局敎導自警　員，所以我們絕對否認自警團是「烏合之衆」，而是集合了一切民間優越力量的大成。</p>
<p>自警團員諸君，大都是優秀靑年，刻苦耐勞，為服務人羣而努力，實在是非常榮譽的事情。希望同志們：都自肅自勉，爭取這種光榮！</p>
<p>各長官檢閱自警團</p>
<h3>周兼團長訓詞</h3>
<p>各位同志：今天有機會向各位講話，覺得非常的愉快，在檢閱進行的時候，又見到大家精神飽滿，動作準確，都充滿了朝氣，更覺得高興，各位正像今天早晨的太陽一樣，前途有着無限的光明！</p>
<p>各位大都是有工作的職業靑年，能够利用業餘的時間，參加自警自衛的組織，刻苦耐勞，受嚴格的訓練，從事困苦的工作，這種苦幹的精神，實在值得欽佩！</p>
<p>認淸時代猛自反省</p>
<p>今天要簡單的向各位講的，每一：是要認淸時代，各位都知道現今世界的局勢，一天比一天緊張，而我們自己的國家，對外還沒有完全的解脫英美帝國主義的柬縛；而得到獨立自由，對內尚不能完成和平統一，所以今後需要我們的努力很多，即以中國政治經濟的中　上海來說，一切建設與復興，亦需要巿民的加倍努力，我們為了國家民族的生存，為了上海市的復興和建設，大家都要猛自反省，站到一般民衆的前端，去為國家服務，為地方工作。</p>
<p>負起責任勇往邁進</p>
<p>其次：要請各位抱定百折不回的決心，負起責任，勇往邁進，因為我們人民是社會國家的細胞，各位更是細胞中的堅强份子，所以我們要負起責任，為國家社會服務，但是無論做那一件事情，都不免有艱難困苦，因來在戰局緊張的時候，無論在協力維持治安，及防空救護各方面，都要秉着艱苦卓絕的精神，咬緊牙關，廓淸一切困難，向前幹去！</p>
<p>復興中華復興東亞</p>
<p>第三：我們要發揮力量，完成使命，我記得以前會經說過：「精神的力量與決心能勝過百萬大軍」。諸位都是年靑有為，祇要我們有一致的精神，與堅決的決心，那末我們的力量，是可以超過一切的，同時我們還想到國家已經到了生死存亡的關頭，雖然目前我們不能把這種力量直接到前方去發揮，但先從協力大上海治安的自警自衛工作做起。以鞏周後方，進而貢獻一切力量，來復興中國，復興東亞。</p>
<p>諸位過去對於本巿場力治安，消弭盜賊的功績，本人深為感謝，希望各位，更進一步的努力，淬勵發揚，因為大上海的建設，新中國的復興，都靠諸位的共同努力。</p>
<h3>羅兼委員長詞</h3>
<p>各位同志：兼團長的訓示，想大家都已深切的明瞭，今後必能本着訓示去力行！本人現在再來補充幾點意見：</p>
<p>捨己為羣犧牲小我</p>
<p>第一：要有「捨已為羣」的精神，我們知道「人生以服務為目的」。人本來應該服務社會，以謀大衆的福利，自警團員更應特別加强服務的精神，更要具有「捨己為羣」的精神，換句話說，就是要有「犧牲小我，顧全大我」的精神，那末自警團的精神，纔能發揮到最高度，而其力量也自然的雄厚起來。</p>
<p>果敢機警努力服務</p>
<p>第二：要有公正的能度，和果敢的應付，自警團與民衆接觸得最為密切，在勸解和指導民衆事件的時候，態度一定要公正，不得有所偏頗，致引起民衆的反感。同時一旦邁着緊急的事故，必須以果敢機　的手段去應付。現在是戰時，意外的事件，不可預斜，如空襲之遭遇等，應付的時候，非出以果敢機　的手段不可！一切須迅速，確實，纔能收到效果。</p>
<p>刻苦耐勞完成使命</p>
<p>第三：要達成　保一致，自警團是保甲方面的機構，同時也是輔佐警察的一翼，警保一致，便是自警團與警察軍然一體，不分界限，為維持秩序，安定地方，而共同努力，這樣便是加强力量的一個方法。同時「非警保一致，斷不能完成自警團應負之使命。</p>
<p>所以本人對各位熱忱服務地方的義勇精神，固然非常欽佩！但是更希望將這種精神，再發揚光大，進而為國家民族努力，同時協力於大東亞戰爭的完遂。</p>
<h3>渡兼副團長詞</h3>
<p>渡兼副團長訓詞略謂：「今日本人以兼副團長賢格參加，特發表些微感想，迴溯四年前，本人奉調赴警局工作時，警察機構中，猶無保甲的組織，嗣後為維持地方治安、保衛上海起見，乃策動組織保甲及市警團，今日有此成績，深為上海前途良好之慶幸。過去上海在英美統治下，被壓制如半殖民地情形，而警察與民衆亳不聯繫，上海社會成為萬惡淵源之地，自保甲自警團產生後，一切恐怖行為，盜賊奸　，己逐漸减少，此點不得不歸功於各位呆埠自警團之努力。上海租界收回至今，閱時一載有餘，今後希望各位在周市長領導下，格外努方進行建設大上海，今日各位之良好成績，本人頗可自慰。目前時局日益緊張，責任非常重大，應不辭艱辛。最近敵機時來侵襲本市，在防範上應加緊努力，担當所負使命。」</p>

<p>次由李贊　代表來賓致答詞，謂：「軍事最高顧問矢崎中將閣下，前在廣東擔任特務機關長及述絡部長四年有餘，對於廣東方面軍事及政治上均有英大之協助。此次擔任團府軍事最高顧問後，常赴各地視察軍政狀況及民問情形、關心備至，在改革上頗多貢獻，此後甚望矢崎中將閣下對於上海方面亦時時賜敎與協助，則不勝企幸之至。」至九時許賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>上週巿况</h3>
<p>滬市金融商品市況，上週因國際形勢不斷演進關係，蒙受猛烈波動，國府最高經濟顧問小倉氏來滬發表談話，重申消減投機囤積之決心，各業商品價格雖均趨穩，然以敵美總統羅斯福病逝消息傳滬後之刺激，投機巿儈乘機用勢，製造謠言，暗中伸手，瘋狂活躍，遂將視為投機中心之華股，暗市黃金公債價格，高抬至空前罕有之最高峯。按上週一華股·烚赤·公債行情初尙於馳升狀態中略見平穩，後則奔騰躍漲，仍承前週之漲勢節節挺進，週二以國際形勢明朗化，謠言多已證實不確，買賣兩方投機者，拋吸不　，乃反即漲為跌，結果升跌互見。至週三忽有利多之傳說，華股執門者及公債·烚赤·紋銀等扶搖直上，俏漲渝逾常，華股並多漲吿停板。週四金銀暗市，價格先係體旋趨跌，後即轉漲，股市債市以國際消息刺激，乃有利多之說，價格即吿飛騰上升。週五以敵美總統逝世消息發表，晨初開巿尙有上漲之勢，旋乃一致慘跌，華股跌停板，公債竟至鮮有人問津，所謂熱門股及烚赤等跌價，已創空前紀錄，嗣即步回至開巿價格，並無再漲能力。週六投機份子又施造謠慣技，一時利多傳說紛紜、烚赤奔漲至七百八十五萬之鉅，較前週六行情又漲起一百二十五萬元，紋銀亦帶升甚多，公債丙種並升至二萬五千元，華股亦均奔漲停板。關於工商各業商品巿價，週初與週末均平穩，其間雖有趨堅步降之勢，但仍無顯</p>

<h3>模範自警團</h3>
<p>昨天本市自警團團本部舉行自警團模範隊員春季檢閱，行列整齊，精神飽滿，情緒熱烈，誠是空前的壯舉。</p>
<p>自警團模範隊員，多數是職業靑年，在業餘時間；接受訓練，能有如此成績，尤為難得。這種壯舉，不但在事變以前所無，即在創立自警團制度之時，也不會料到今日的成績，這是主持諸君以及參加團員的努力，値得欽佩。同時深信今後經過不屢的共同努力，發展推廣，則將來不難成為保衛大上海的雄厚力量。</p>
<p>周兼團長在訓詞中提示：時局愈緊張，環境愈艱難，而我們愈需要努力。我們希望各界對於保甲，對於自警團，盡一切力量支援。自警團諸君也以保衛地方，保衛上海為職志，急起維護治安的重任，做到自管團警察化，而在服務精神上尤須超渦警察，充分表現自治的能力。</p>

<h3>Japanese Kamikaze Corps Sorties Day and Night, Continuing Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships, Sinking and Destroying Numerous Vessels Around Okinawa</h3>
<p>Southwest XX Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The battle to annihilate the enemy mobile force around Okinawa Island has intensified daily. The Japanese Kamikaze Corps also launched an attack on the night of the 13th. A unit dispatched from the vicinity of Okinawa Island reported: "Attack successful," but the specific results are still unclear. Another Japanese unit attacking the enemy's southern forces on the same island reaped the result of setting three enemy locations on fire. On the afternoon of the 14th, an attack on the enemy mobile force east of Okinawa Island caused one enemy ship to emit black smoke and another to catch fire. Another Japanese unit dispatched on the same day destroyed one enemy large aircraft carrier and set it on fire, causing considerable damage to two other ships of unknown type. Nine pillars of fire were confirmed in the sea south of Amami Oshima.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island, sinking two cruisers and damaging two battleships. Later that night, they caught an enemy fleet in the waters east of the island and subjected it to a fierce attack, damaging five warships of unspecified types. They also attacked an enemy fleet in the southern waters, causing eleven ships to catch fire and sinking five of them.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Associated Press reports that the U.S. Navy Department made the following statement to reporters on the 13th: "The brave attacks of the Japanese Kamikaze Corps, confirmed to have begun half a year ago during the battle of Leyte in the Philippines, have been incredibly fierce against American ships during landing operations in Lingayen Gulf, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and elsewhere."</p>
<h3>Okinawa Enters Decisive Battle Phase, Japanese Elite Troops in Major Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After enemy troops landed on the west coast of southern Okinawa Island and made some progress in land operations, they launched a sudden advance, attempting to break into the main Japanese positions in the south. However, they were met with fierce Japanese resistance, and the enemy's advance was temporarily halted. They then sought another route, deploying a large number of transport ships into the waters off Kadena to actively resupply the rear and reinforce the front lines. In order to open the war situation, they deployed dozens of transport ships and other vessels into Nakagusuku Bay, waiting for an opportunity to strike. However, they were blocked by the Japanese's strong defenses and could only land on Tsuken Island. After that, they increased their forces, attempting to build large-caliber artillery positions. On the 7th, they landed in Nago Bay, attempting to consolidate a foothold in the north. They also coordinated with enemy aircraft and heavy artillery positions built on Kamiya Island, as well as the movements of battleship and cruiser mobile groups, to deplete the strength of the main Japanese positions. The Japanese Kamikaze attack corps, as well as land, sea, and air forces, and naval units, began simultaneous attacks from the 5th onwards, attacking fiercely day and night. Since the beginning of this campaign, it has been confirmed that 326 enemy warships have been sunk or destroyed. After suffering this unprecedented blow, the enemy deployed ship-based aircraft to the Ie Shima area. On the 7th, a total of about 300 enemy aircraft appeared, on the 8th, 500 to 600, and on the 11th, 300. During this period, the enemy's offensive appeared unstable due to weather conditions. The fleet group around the island also gradually decreased, with only a few battleships and other ships seen on the 11th and 12th. Although the enemy's mobile force has been reduced, the enemy has landed tens of thousands of troops since the beginning of the attack on Okinawa Island. This Okinawa operation has claimed occupied areas such as Ie Shima, Kamiya Island, Tsuken Island, and Okinawa Island itself in order to secure land-based artillery positions, heavy artillery positions, and land-based air bases. There is activity of B-24 type and small enemy aircraft at the two airfields in the northern and central parts of the island, and this trend cannot be ignored. However, whether the enemy can secure land-based artillery platforms and airfields before their aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers are destroyed, or whether the Japanese army can annihilate all of their aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers, is related to the entire war situation. But what can decide the situation is the strength of both sides' air power. The battle flag for the decisive battle of Okinawa has been raised. The elite Japanese land forces who have been rigorously preparing in the main positions in the southern part of the island began a major counteroffensive from the evening of the 12th. The Japanese air force also launched a fierce attack on enemy aircraft at the two airfields in the north and center. Today, the war situation has reached its most critical stage. Whether it is Japan or the United States, any hesitation or delay in the front or rear will undoubtedly lead to failure.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from Guam, Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 14th that the U.S. 24th Army Corps on Okinawa Island repelled a fierce Japanese counterattack before dawn on the 13th. According to an Associated Press reporter's report, the U.S. 24th Army Corps has failed to advance a single step for eight consecutive days, which shows how fierce the ground war in southern Okinawa is. This is the largest artillery battle in the Pacific Theater, especially on the 13th, which was the eleventh day.</p>
<h3>Real Situation of Agricultural Loans Handled by the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>To understand the real situation of rural loans, the reporter was dispatched to the Bank of Communications, which has the best performance in handling agricultural loans. He met with Mr. Zhang Zounong, the head of the Agricultural Economics Department of the bank, who is responsible for promoting this work. Mr. Zhang is an expert in rural economics, and he explained the bank's agricultural loan situation in detail and provided many key points that should be noted when handling agricultural loans. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Agricultural Loans Not for Profit</p>
<p>After the Bank of Communications resumed operations in September 1942, it sent personnel to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to investigate the real situation of the rural economy and formulated a policy for handling agricultural finance, including improving the rural economic situation, guiding farmers to establish a financial system and financial institutions that are self-managed, self-owned, and self-enjoyed, supporting the establishment of self-cultivating farmers, increasing agricultural production, and assisting in agricultural improvement and promotion. On May 5, 1943, the Agricultural Economics Department was added to the head office, with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai as the business areas for the time being. Agricultural economics offices were set up in Jiaxing, Suzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Dongtai, and other places to guide local agriculture and handle loan investments. Accounting is completely independent, and the business is not for profit. If there is a surplus, it will be listed as an agricultural financial business fund to expand business and reduce loan interest rates. The business fund and initial operating capital were allocated by the bank. Later, the business expansion was insufficient, so in April 1944, a loan of 100 million yuan was borrowed from the Central Trust of China.</p>
<p>Agricultural Loan Targets, Regions, and Numbers</p>
<p>Rural production increase loans were originally designated to rural cooperative organizations, but due to various difficulties, loans were changed to individual farmers. In order to promote this loan, contracts were signed with relevant authorities, banks, farms, and other groups to promote business. As of the most recent loans to individual farmers, the areas are in Yancheng, Dongtai, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Jinxi, Wuxi, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Taicang, Wujiang, Songjiang, Nanhui, Fengxian, and Qingpu counties in Jiangsu Province, as well as the suburbs of Nanjing and Shanghai, and Jiaxing, Jiashan, Haining, and Hangxian counties in Zhejiang. A total of 6,754 households have been loaned to increase production. In January 1944, the loan limit per household was no more than 3,000 yuan. Later, due to rising prices, it gradually increased to 5,000 yuan, and recently increased to 20,000 yuan per household. The loan period is based on the harvest period of major crops. Farmers are only required to provide security, and if it is difficult to find security, more than ten farmers can provide mutual joint guarantee. Land deeds or other collateral are generally not accepted, so that loans can benefit poor households and small tenant farmers. However, whether the loan applicant is a truly honest farmer who operates farmland and whether there is a need for a loan is carefully and accurately investigated in advance. When issuing loans, the bank sends personnel to directly issue them to farmers, and for those who have re-loan relationships, the bank also sends personnel to the site to supervise the issuance to show caution and prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>Farmers Universally Recognize the Meaning of Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has been handling agricultural financial business for two years, and it has been operating diligently in various difficult environments, constantly promoting, the area is crystal clear, and the amount of loans has reached more than 160 million yuan, but the expenses are extremely low, and the staff, regardless of the heat, the distance, the amount of travel expenses, and the security, have gone deep into the countryside, investigating the economic conditions of farm families one by one, and issuing loans directly. On average, at least 20 to 30 people are present every day, and the speed of business development is beyond expectations. However, at the beginning of the loan, very few farmers applied for loans. All were afraid of bearing the obligation of loan interest and repayment on time, and there were other burdens, deliberately watching and hesitant to move forward. After a few farmers tried it and found that the bank's loan was purely a good deed, other villagers dared to come one after another. As the news spread, from Yancheng in northern Jiangsu to Hangxian in Zhejiang, applicants for loans flocked in an endless stream. Therefore, in the loan area of the bank, even in remote rural areas, everyone knows about "the Bank of Communications handling agricultural loans." Letters from local government offices, public groups, and money industry representatives transferring farmers to the bank to handle loans in their respective places are like snowflakes. Individual farmers not only repay the principal and interest, but also repay the loans before the due date, with very few overdue, and there are no arrears. It can be seen that in this extraordinary period, rural lending is not as unsafe as imagined, and the creditworthiness of farmers is no less than that of cities.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Agricultural Loans and Agricultural Production Increase</p>
<p>If we look at the actual effect of the entire loan business of the Bank of Communications, it is better to regard it as assisting in reproduction than assisting in increasing production. At a time when the price index is rising and the purchasing power of money is weakening, the price of agricultural products per mu of farmland in last year's autumn harvest is not even the cost of reproducing the same crops on one mu in this year's spring. Moreover, the rate of increase in the prices of daily necessities exceeds that of general agricultural products. In addition, there are heavy taxes and levies, and the collection of agricultural products at suppressed prices. Farmers are often forced to suppress the price of agricultural products below a reasonable price and sacrifice painfully. Therefore, production is often reduced due to lack of fertilizer, seeds, agricultural tools, cattle, and wages, and even land is abandoned and left barren. It can be seen that it is difficult for farmers to engage in reproduction, let alone increase production. Since the Bank of Communications started lending, farmers have been able to purchase the fertilizer they lack, repair and add to their agricultural tools, and pay the wages for irrigation and harvesting. In addition to avoiding the abnormal phenomenon of "selling green" to make up for the wound, it can also delay the time for selling agricultural products to wait for a good price, and then exchange for the fertilizer and agricultural tools they need, so that they can engage in reproduction, so the effect is very significant.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zounong Provides Advice</p>
<p>Experts in handling agricultural loans and experienced talents are indispensable, but the middle and lower-level staff who have a strong interest in rural work should not be ignored.</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications is handling loan repayment. If half of the loan is repaid in kind, the price of rice will be different in various places in the autumn, and malpractices are easy to occur in the amount, so the issue of integrity is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The drafting of various detailed rules and the design of forms all take time, so attention should be paid to saving time. As spring plowing is approaching, poor farmers are in great need of funds, and efforts should be made to be swift and avoid various twists and turns.</p>
<p>It is better to lend directly to farmers. The township and baojia organizations are not entirely reliable, and malpractices should be prevented during the investigation.</p>
<p>Farmers are mostly distrustful of agricultural loan work at first, and have a wait-and-see mentality, so workers must carry out patient persuasion work.</p>
<p>It is wise to target rice-producing areas for agricultural loan areas, but the agricultural areas should not be too fragmented to avoid investigation difficulties.</p>
<p>It is best for the government to guarantee the principal and interest to increase people's trust.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting South of Mandalay, Japanese Forces Intercepting, Attempting to Stop Enemy Forces Advancing South</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the Japanese army units in Burma withdrew from Lashio, the Burmese war situation has entered a new phase. The current battle line is from Mandalay to the Ledo Road area near Yangon, and fierce fighting is taking place south of Mandalay. After the enemy's newly formed 1st Army invaded west of Lashio, the 50th Division was in the Mamsa area west of Lashio, and the British 36th Division was advancing in the Mongmit area. In the Mandalay area, the 33rd Army attempted to advance south, and the 4th Army advanced south from the Meiktila area. The Japanese army units have completed reorganizing the battle line and re-equipping, and are bravely intercepting. At the same time, the enemy forces advancing south along the Irrawaddy River from the Nyaung-u area are echoing the offensive in the Meiktila area, attempting to invade Yenangyaung. The Japanese army units continue to counterattack, crushing the enemy's attempt to change the direction of the offensive.</p>
<p>Burma Front Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The center of the Burmese war situation is gradually moving south from the Ledo Road between Mandalay and Yangon. Before the rainy season, the enemy continued to reinforce troops in the highway area, gradually advancing from the western part of Lashio. The newly formed 1st Army, along with the Irrawaddy River, attempted to advance south to Yenangyaung, echoing the operations on the left and right wings. The enemy forces in the Lashio area have seized the highway between Lashio and Mandalay, and the enemy's newly formed 1st Army is continuing its advance, advancing south along the Laja Highway, and has now invaded Machi, 70 kilometers southeast of Lashio, completing its planned shift. However, the enemy's advance has been blocked by the Japanese garrison's interception, and the enemy's momentum in this area has become noticeably slower. From March 1st to March 20th, the Japanese army inflicted the following damage on the enemy: 1,321 abandoned corpses. Also, the enemy's powerful forces that invaded the vicinity of Meiktila, began a new attack on April 3rd and 4th, advancing south from the Popaywaung area with about 70 tanks as the vanguard. On the 10th, the enemy advanced into the Yemasan area (110 kilometers southeast of Meiktila). The Japanese troops stationed in the area continued to launch fierce counterattacks from the east, west, and south, inflicting great damage on the enemy. The open area south of Meiktila has seen uninterrupted fierce fighting since the beginning of the Burma campaign. The enemy, along the Irrawaddy River, advancing south from the Nyaung-u area, attempted to invade Yenangyaung. The Japanese army is currently deployed along the Sekku-Kyaukpadaung line (30 kilometers southwest of Nyaung-u), continuing fierce counterattacks and crushing the enemy's attempt to advance south. Also, the main force of the 4th Army took advantage of the enemy's weakness and attacked the enemy's rear base at Pipi, destroying five enemy cargo trucks, two gasoline accumulation points, two ammunition accumulation points, and 50 barracks, securing the southwest coast of Ryukei and Akyab Island. Since this spring, the enemy in this area has invaded the coastal area opposite Akyab Island. Part of the enemy forces has gradually advanced into the Taunggok area since late March, and is now advancing into the Arakan-Taunggok area (120 kilometers southeast of Ryukei) in an attempt to advance. The elite Japanese troops have launched fierce attacks on this and inflicted great damage, and turned to the established positions on the eastern highlands, launching fierce counterattacks everywhere, stopping the enemy forces advancing in the rear.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Japan Suffer Heavy Losses Since October</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News - Today, June 16th of last year, marks exactly ten months since the enemy's U.S. B-29 bombers first raided northern Kyushu, Japan. According to the Navy Information Department here, based on the announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters and its reliable information, an investigation into the enemy's aircraft movements has revealed that the Japanese air defense force has shot down 468 of the 3,712 enemy aircraft that have come to Japan during these ten months, and damaged 929. In mid-March, when enemy aircraft raided Japan four times, 30 were forced to land on Iwo Jima. Based on this fact, it is undoubtedly presumed that at least half of the above-mentioned damaged enemy aircraft crashed into the sea on their way back. Therefore, the total number of enemy B-29 aircraft lost in the past ten months is actually no less than 900. Based on this figure, calculating the loss of personnel and materials, if we assume that the crew of the B-29 is ten people, then there are a total of 9,000 people, and the cost of each aircraft is 600,000 US dollars, then the total loss is 720 million US dollars. Because the enemy aircraft carried out indiscriminate bombing, the damage on the Japanese side is certainly not small, but the enemy's losses are even greater. At the end of last year, the enemy announced that the production volume of B-29 aircraft was 135 per month. Based on this figure, the production volume in the past year is about 1,200 or 300 aircraft. Each aircraft is shot down or damaged by the Japanese side on average after flying only four raids at most. Due to the difficulty of supply, the enemy has now stopped the plan to attack Japan from India or the Chinese mainland, and only takes off from the Mariana Islands base to attack. However, according to a United Press report from Guam on the 14th, the commander of the enemy's 21st Bombardment Squadron, LeMay, claimed that more B-29 aircraft are needed to attack Japan, which proves how significant the consumption of B-29 aircraft air raids on Japan is. It is also extremely important and actually has the intention of encircling Berlin from the north. Its strategic goal is clearly to meet with the Soviet army in Stettin. The development in the Bavaria area has also become apparent. The United States has advanced from the Wurzburg area to the Bayreuth area. Whether General Patton's troops on this road will advance east to reach Prague (the old capital of Czechoslovakia), or turn to the southeast to pass through Nuremberg, Fürth, and Regensburg, remains to be decided. Therefore, Soviet Marshal Tolbukhin's left wing in Vienna has passed St. Pölten and is pushing west towards Linz-Regensburg, so its southeast advance also has its possibility.</p>
<h3>Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni Transferred to Military Councilor</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 15th that Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, the commander of the defense force, has been transferred to military councilor. According to Prince Naruhiko, after graduating from the Army University, he served as the captain of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Military Academy, commander of the 5th Brigade, General Staff Headquarters, commander of the 2nd and 4th Divisions, military councilor and chief of the Air Defense Headquarters. He became the commander-in-chief of the defense force in 1941. During the Sino-Japanese War, he made remarkable achievements in the Battle of Hankou.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expedite the Organization of Shanghai's Municipal Agricultural Loan Syndicate</h3>
<p>The countryside and the city have an inseparable connection. The current decline of the rural economy will have a serious impact on the people and industries of Shanghai, and Shanghai is no exception. In other words, as agricultural production decreases, the supply of food and raw materials needed by urban residents and industry decreases accordingly. As a result, the efficiency of the lives of urban residents and industrial production is directly affected. Therefore, carrying out large-scale work to save the rural economy is indeed a matter of utmost urgency. At present, Shanghai has a large amount of idle capital. If there is no legitimate outlet, it will only become a tool for speculation and profiteering, endangering the social economy. The most important method to save the rural economy at present is to provide agricultural loans and relieve farmers from the pain of high-interest loans. If agricultural loans are provided with Shanghai's capital, Shanghai's idle capital will have a legitimate outlet and will no longer be a speculative tool that disrupts the market. This will not only reduce the abnormal phenomenon of the urban economy but also save the declining and morbid state of the rural economy. The ultimate goal is to promote increased agricultural production so that the food needs of urban residents and the raw material needs of industrial production can be increased and satisfied. Therefore, providing agricultural loans with Shanghai's idle capital is, on the one hand, saving the rural economy and, at the same time, strengthening the city's own economy; in other words, saving others is saving oneself.</p>
<p>Agricultural loan work is not a novel initiative. It has been implemented for a long time in the past. In the past two years, the Bank of Communications has handled agricultural loans in various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces with excellent results. The article "The Actual Situation of Agricultural Loans Handled by the Bank of Communications" published in this newspaper today shows the farmers' urgent need for loans and the relationship between agricultural loans and increased production. Therefore, we feel even more that it is necessary to promote agricultural loan work as soon as possible. Based on the experience of the Bank of Communications in handling agricultural loans, the points that should be paid attention to in handling agricultural loans in the future are explained as follows:</p>
<p>At first, farmers held a wait-and-see attitude towards loans, and there were very few applicants. After a few farmers tried it, they found that it was a well-intentioned act, so they came one after another, forming a situation where even remote rural areas knew about the Bank of Communications' agricultural loans. From this, it can be seen that the meaning of agricultural loans has been widely recognized in rural areas. In the future, there is no need to do any more publicity work, and it can be started at any time.</p>
<p>Farmers can repay loans on time and as agreed, which shows that agricultural loans have established a good reputation among farmers. Farmers are also loyal to the agreement, which will reduce many difficulties in future agricultural loan work and ensure the full use of funds.</p>
<p>In recent years, farmers in various places have been burdened with heavy taxes and levies, and their funds are short. As a result, they cannot obtain sufficient seeds, fertilizers, etc., which are necessary for agricultural production, affecting production efficiency. At the same time, in order to obtain seeds and fertilizers, they have to sell unripe crops to make ends meet and suffer from high-interest loans. With agricultural loans, they can exchange for the necessary tools for production and avoid selling unripe crops and high-interest loans. Therefore, agricultural loans directly contribute to increased agricultural production without any doubt.</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has handled increased production loans for a total of 6,754 households in more than ten counties in Anhui Province, four counties in Zhejiang Province such as Jiaxing, and several counties in Shanghai, such as Nanhui. Comparing the total number of farm households in the above-mentioned areas with the number of loan households, it can be seen that the proportion of loan-receiving farm households is very small, that is, the number of those who have benefited from agricultural loans is not large. In the future, Shanghai should urgently organize a loan syndicate to handle agricultural loans, expand the scope, and promote the area, so that farmers in various places can benefit universally.</p>
<p>The amount of money lent by the Bank of Communications to each farmer has increased from 3,000 yuan in January of the 33rd year to 20,000 yuan recently. According to the current price situation, the loan amount still needs to be increased. However, the Bank of Communications' total agricultural loan funds are only more than 100 million yuan, which is obviously insufficient. If it is necessary to expand the area in the future, a huge amount of money will be needed, and it is inevitable that a large-scale syndicate will raise a large amount of funds.</p>
<p>We stated in the editorial on the 6th of this month that we should simultaneously crack down on speculation and guide idle capital, and advocated that to crack down on speculation, we must first divert the capital of speculative tools to the countryside. The financial community should be the center, and the Shanghai Municipal Rural Loan Syndicate should be organized as soon as possible to handle agricultural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. Now that we have seen the actual situation of the Bank of Communications' handling of agricultural loans in the past two years, we feel that it is even more necessary to promote it as soon as possible. We hope that the Municipal Council and the private sector will take action quickly.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Concrete Implementation of Rural Loans</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the reckless movement of idle capital in Shanghai and guide it towards production, the issue of rural loans has been raised. This measure can simultaneously save the Shanghai economy and the local economy. It is a two-pronged approach that deserves attention.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that Shanghai's idle capital has now lost its normal outlet and is trending towards speculation and hoarding. Turning idle capital into productive capital is the biggest issue for the Shanghai economy, which is very clear and obvious. However, turning idle capital into productive capital is easier said than done. The occurrence of idle capital itself is caused by the economic recession, so it is somewhat reversed to use the recovery of production as a countermeasure. Therefore, the current countermeasure for idle capital must be a new countermeasure. Rural loans can be said to be the most appropriate countermeasure.</p>
<p>Everyone who has contact with farmers unanimously admits how much the countryside needs production funds. Moreover, one can understand the rampant situation of high-interest capital in the countryside. Rural interest rates reach one-tenth per half-year and must be paid in kind. This fact is sufficient to show how exhausted rural finance is and how much farmers need production funds. At this time, several billion funds will flow into the countryside and become farmers' production funds. The contribution to increased agricultural production is undoubtedly great, and it can also complete a very important task in overcoming rural social disasters. Using the capital that causes harmful effects in the city for rural areas and creating constructive effects is the important meaning of rural loans.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee is the main body that first proposed agricultural loans and plans to put them into practice. We deeply respect the enthusiastic efforts of the committee members in raising this issue. It is by no means easy to guide Shanghai's idle capital to agricultural finance that does not focus on profits. In the future, difficulties will naturally arise during implementation. For example, farmers can repay half of the loan in kind, which is also a countermeasure that fully considers the investor's position. We hope that the Rice Control Committee and other agencies will correctly recognize this point and provide full assistance. The principle of agricultural loans is feasible, but reducing difficulties in technical aspects depends on the cooperation of all parties. Therefore, we especially hope that all parties will cooperate to realize this loan.</p>
<p>If agricultural loans can be realized and Shanghai's idle capital can make a concrete contribution to agricultural production, the extent to which China's wartime economic system can be strengthened is impossible to estimate today. At the same time, it can also fundamentally eliminate the activities of speculative elements with Shanghai as their lair and the disasters of high-interest capital with the countryside as their base. This can make a great contribution to the soundness of Chinese society. We hope that the promoters of agricultural loans will overcome all difficulties and achieve success.

Other attendees included Deputy Commanders Du Zhengjian and Lu Ying, Deputy Secretary-General Okawa Rinpei, Instructors Hiraoka Isamu and Noguchi Kinjiro, directors of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, directors of various branches of the Municipal Police Bureau, Chief of the Police Corps Tsukazaki, directors and section chiefs of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, members of the Municipal District Baojia Committee Lin Kanghou, Zhang Deqin, Xu Jianping, Le Fenghou, Zhou Mengzi, Chen Fukang, and Wu Zhesheng, and members of the Municipal District Baojia Propaganda Committee Chen Binsu, Chen Riping, and Zhang Shankun, as well as representatives from the Allied embassies and consulates and consultant Funatsu, attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>Review Ceremony</p>
<p>The review started on time. After the flag-raising ceremony, the corps flag ceremony was held. The party flag officials marched towards the square in large strides. Chief commanders Xiao Gang and Liu Bingquan reported the number of reviewers to Commander Zhou. There were a total of sixteen units from the cadre training class and various districts, with 145 captains and 6,750 corps members.

<p>Commander Zhou Salutes</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Gu's Speech</h3>
<p>Today is the Spring Review of the model team members of the Shanghai Special Municipality Self-Police Corps. We are deeply excited that the Commander and all the leaders have taken the time to attend despite their busy schedules.</p>
<p>The Self-Police Corps of this city was established in haste in the past. Although the comrades of the Self-Police Corps have fulfilled many responsibilities and established many achievements for local duties under various different organizations and institutions, from the overall point of view, without a unified organization and training, the Self-Police Corps still cannot exert greater strength.</p>
<p>Constant Self-Inspection of Spiritual Unity</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Self-Police Corps was announced on September 9th of last year because of the needs of the environment. It began the unified organization and training work, adjusted the organization of the Self-Police Corps in various regions, and connected them together, gradually forming a new atmosphere.</p>
<p>The work of reorganizing the members of the Self-Police Corps in various districts is now coming to an end. At least we have achieved unity in spirit. The issues of clothing and all facilities are also being gradually adjusted. I hope that every comrade has the confidence of unity.</p>
<p>Serving the People and Defending Shanghai</p>
<p>Among the Self-Police Corps comrades, there are many excellent people, especially among our cadre comrades, there are many classmates from various military academies with profound qualifications. They do not seek fame and fortune, bury their heads in hard work, serve the local area, and assist the police bureau in teaching the Self-Police Corps members. Therefore, we absolutely deny that the Self-Police Corps is a "motley crowd", but a great achievement of gathering all the superior forces of the people.</p>
<p>The comrades of the Self-Police Corps are mostly excellent young people who work hard and strive to serve the people. It is indeed a very honorable thing. I hope that the comrades will all be self-respecting and self-improving, and strive for this glory!</p>
<p>Leaders Inspect the Self-Police Corps</p>
<h3>Commander Zhou's Speech</h3>
<p>Comrades, I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to you today. When the review was in progress, I saw that everyone was full of energy and their movements were accurate. They were all full of vitality. I am even more happy. You are just like the sun this morning, with unlimited bright prospects!</p>
<p>Most of you are young professionals with jobs. You are able to use your spare time to participate in self-police and self-defense organizations, work hard, undergo strict training, and engage in difficult work. This spirit of hard work is really admirable!</p>
<p>Recognize the Times and Reflect Intensely</p>
<p>What I want to say to you simply today is: First, we must recognize the times. You all know that the world situation is becoming more and more tense every day. Our own country has not yet completely broken free from the shackles of British and American imperialism and gained independence and freedom. Internally, it has not yet completed peaceful unification. Therefore, we need a lot of efforts in the future. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of China, as an example, all construction and revival also require the double efforts of the citizens. For the survival of the country and the nation, for the revival and construction of Shanghai, we must all reflect intensely, stand at the forefront of the general public, and serve the country and work for the local area.</p>
<p>Take Responsibility and March Forward Courageously</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to ask you to have the determination to never give up, take responsibility, and march forward courageously. Because we, the people, are the cells of the social country, and you are the strong members of the cells. Therefore, we must take responsibility and serve the country and society. However, no matter what we do, there will inevitably be difficulties and hardships. Because when the war is tense, we must maintain security and air defense and rescue in all aspects with the spirit of hard work and perseverance, grit our teeth, and overcome all difficulties to move forward!</p>
<p>Revive China and Revive East Asia</p>
<p>Thirdly, we must exert our strength and complete our mission. I remember saying before: "The power of spirit and determination can overcome millions of troops." You are all young and promising. As long as we have a consistent spirit and a firm determination, then our strength can surpass everything. At the same time, we also think that the country has reached a critical moment of life and death. Although we cannot directly exert this power to the front line at present, we should start with the self-police and self-defense work that assists the security of Shanghai. To consolidate the rear, and then contribute all our strength to revive China and revive East Asia.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for your past contributions to maintaining the security of the market and eliminating thieves. I hope that you will make further efforts to inspire and carry forward, because the construction of Greater Shanghai and the revival of New China depend on your joint efforts.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Luo's Speech</h3>
<p>Comrades, I think you all deeply understand the Commander's instructions, and you will be able to put them into practice based on the instructions in the future! Now I will add a few more opinions:</p>
<p>Sacrifice for the Group and Sacrifice the Small Self</p>
<p>First, we must have the spirit of "sacrificing ourselves for the group." We know that "the purpose of life is to serve." People should originally serve the society to seek the welfare of the public. The members of the Self-Police Corps should especially strengthen the spirit of service and have the spirit of "sacrificing ourselves for the group." In other words, we must have the spirit of "sacrificing the small self and taking care of the big self," then the spirit of the Self-Police Corps can be brought to the highest degree, and its strength will naturally be strong.</p>
<p>Be Decisive, Alert, and Strive to Serve</p>
<p>Second, we must have a fair attitude and be decisive in dealing with emergencies. The Self-Police Corps has the closest contact with the people. When persuading and guiding the people's incidents, we must be fair and not be biased, which may cause resentment among the people. At the same time, once we encounter an emergency, we must deal with it decisively and alertly. Now is wartime, and unexpected events cannot be predicted, such as encountering an air raid, etc. When dealing with it, we must use decisive and alert means! Everything must be quick and sure to achieve results.</p>
<p>Work Hard and Complete the Mission</p>
<p>Third, we must achieve unity between the police and the security. The Self-Police Corps is an institution of the Baojia system, and it is also a wing to assist the police. The unity between the police and the security means that the Self-Police Corps and the police are naturally one body, without boundaries, and work together to maintain order and stabilize the local area. This is a way to strengthen the strength. At the same time, "without the unity between the police and the security, we cannot complete the mission that the Self-Police Corps should bear."</p>
<p>Therefore, I am very admirable for your enthusiasm to serve the local area with a spirit of righteousness! But I hope to carry forward this spirit and strive for the country and the nation, and at the same time cooperate in the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Deputy Commander Watanabe's Speech</h3>
<p>Deputy Commander Watanabe's speech briefly stated: "Today, I am participating as Deputy Commander, and I would like to express some of my thoughts. Looking back four years ago, when I was transferred to work at the police bureau, there was no Baojia organization in the police organization. Later, in order to maintain local security and defend Shanghai, I promoted the organization of Baojia and the Municipal Police Corps. Today's achievements are a great blessing for the good future of Shanghai. In the past, Shanghai was suppressed like a semi-colony under British and American rule, and the police and the people had no contact. Shanghai society became a place of all evils. Since the Baojia Self-Police Corps was established, all terrorist acts, thieves, and adulterers have gradually decreased. This point must be attributed to the efforts of the self-police corps. It has been more than a year since the Shanghai concessions were recovered. In the future, I hope that you will make extra efforts under the leadership of Mayor Zhou to build Greater Shanghai. I am quite pleased with your good achievements today. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the responsibility is very heavy. We should not be afraid of hardships. Recently, enemy planes have come to invade our city from time to time. We should step up our efforts in prevention and take on the responsibilities we bear."</p>

After serving as the supreme military advisor of the Group Government, he often went to various places to inspect military and political conditions and the situation among the people, and was very concerned. He has made many contributions to the reform. In the future, I hope that His Excellency Lieutenant General Yazaki will also give us advice and assistance in Shanghai from time to time, which would be a great blessing." The guests and hosts parted happily at around 9:00 pm.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Market Situation</h3>
<p>Shanghai's financial commodity market situation suffered violent fluctuations last week due to the continuous evolution of the international situation. Mr. Ogura, the supreme economic advisor of the National Government, came to Shanghai to make a statement, reiterating the determination to eliminate speculation and hoarding. Although the prices of various commodities tended to stabilize, after the news of the death of enemy US President Roosevelt was transmitted to Shanghai, speculative scalpers took the opportunity to use the situation, create rumors, secretly reach out, and frantically become active, and raised the prices of Chinese stocks, black market gold and public bonds, which were regarded as the center of speculation, to an unprecedented peak. According to last week's market conditions, the prices of Chinese stocks, gold, and public bonds were initially slightly stable in the upward trend, but later they surged and continued to advance in the previous week's upward trend. On Tuesday, the international situation became clear, and many rumors had been confirmed to be inaccurate. Speculators on both the buying and selling sides threw and absorbed without restraint, and then immediately turned the rise into a fall, resulting in both rises and falls. On Wednesday, there were suddenly favorable rumors, and those in charge of Chinese stocks and public bonds, gold, and silver soared, and the speculative gains exceeded the usual. Many Chinese stocks also reported a stop-up. On Thursday, the prices of gold and silver in the black market initially declined, and then turned to rise. The stock market and bond market were stimulated by international news, so there were favorable rumors, and the prices soared. On Friday, with the release of the news of the death of the enemy US president, there was still an upward trend at the beginning of the morning market, but then there was a general tragic decline. Chinese stocks fell to the stop-down limit, and there were few inquiries about public bonds. The so-called hot stocks and gold, etc. fell in price, setting an unprecedented record. Then they stepped back to the opening price, and there was no ability to rise again. On Saturday, speculative elements again used the usual trick of creating rumors. For a time, there were rumors of favorable news, and gold soared to a huge 7.85 million, an increase of 1.25 million yuan compared to the previous Saturday's market conditions. Silver also rose a lot, and C-type public bonds rose to 25,000 yuan. Chinese stocks also soared to the stop-up limit. Regarding the market prices of industrial and commercial commodities, they were stable at the beginning and end of the week. Although there was a trend of strengthening and declining in between, there was still no significant</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Measures for Self-Installation of Generators: The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that various factories and public places in the city often install engines on their own that do not meet the regulations, which hinders stability. In order to unify management and provide technical guidance and corrections, special measures have been formulated and submitted to the Municipal Government for promulgation and implementation.</p>
<p>Disputes over School Rice Distribution and Reporting Procedures: Recently, teachers and staff of various schools in the city often have disciplinary disputes over the distribution of rationed rice, and have sent letters to the Municipal Education Association requesting a thorough investigation. According to the responsible parties of the association, the association will naturally seek a reasonable solution to this issue, but the letters must be filled with the real names and addresses of the reporters in order to have a basis. As for the reporter's name, the association can keep it confidential. Otherwise, anonymous accusations are difficult to accept.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Model Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the headquarters of the Shanghai Self-Defense Corps held a spring inspection of the model team members. The ranks were neat, the spirit was full, and the emotions were enthusiastic. It was truly an unprecedented feat.</p>
<p>Most of the model team members of the Self-Defense Corps are working youth who receive training in their spare time. To achieve such results is particularly commendable. This feat is not only unprecedented before the incident, but even at the time of establishing the Self-Defense Corps system, no one would have expected today's achievements. This is due to the efforts of the leaders and participating members, which is worthy of admiration. At the same time, it is deeply believed that after unremitting joint efforts, development and promotion, it will not be difficult to become a strong force for defending Great Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Corps Commander Zhou Jian reminded in his speech: The more tense the situation and the more difficult the environment, the more we need to work hard. We hope that all sectors of society will provide all possible support for the Baojia system and the Self-Defense Corps. The members of the Self-Defense Corps also take defending the locality and Shanghai as their duty, quickly taking up the important task of maintaining law and order, achieving self-management and police-like capabilities, and surpassing the police in terms of service spirit, fully demonstrating the ability of self-government.</p>
