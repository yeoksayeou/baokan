<p>西南太平洋基地　二十一日中央社電峇厘巴板方面，十五日攻擊三馬林達公路正面之敵軍，當日下午七時許與敵軍二小隊展開激戰，業已殲減一隊，是日敵軍終日以迫擊砲，戰車砲，野砲等砲擊日軍陣地，然並無積極進展。又於鍊汕所方面，當日下午七時半許，日軍擊殲減敵兵約五十名，其他戰綫之敵軍，亦無積極活動，日軍正以肉搏戰術，連日熾烈攻中。</p>

<p>關於美軍企圖實現大陸登陸作戰問題，月前頗堪注意。本年六月杪在渝蔣介石特會見外國記者，及在「抗戰」八週年紀念日告軍民　中，與國民參政會舉行會　時所致訓詞中，三次公開發表，均有明顯表示，不歡迎美軍在巾國大陸登陸。而在六月秒會見外國記者，陳誠亦表示希望美國經濟援助，勝於美軍之登陸云云。惟美國方而於此中國大陸登陸問題，對渝政權絲亳無所表示。本人則以美軍之在巾國大陸登陸，與襲擊日本土之戰略毫無關係，且爲　國另一企圖　之發動。</p>
<h3 id="c22">最近美渝輿論一斑 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>自韋特曼任司令官後，於六月杪設立巾國戰區美軍司令部，渝軍政部亦參與其問。諒爲美軍機關，擬準備　取日軍佔領區後，與渝情報機關謀得連絡。茲爲對窺取各都市方面所作政洽計劇，曾召集中國東部海岸之四員重要都市專門家商談，美軍企間在登陸佔領時，進行各項工作。最近美國及渝方之興論，深盼在中國海岸，美渝兩軍相互握手之實現。査本月十二日渝方廣播時事解釋所稱：如東南海岸佔領，立可獲得與美英軍之海上交通線，且所需物資，亦立司獲得供給，而其所得一日之運輸量，勝於史蒂威爾公路半月之運輸量云。</p>
<h3 id="c23">美軍企圖登陸理由 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>關於美國向東亞伸展魔手之政治野心，如美軍不能在中國大陸登陸，則全歸於泡影。其理由有三：　所謂渝軍之總反攻，因史蒂威爾公路之補給不足，需求美國之海岸補給援助，始能成爲事實，在渝方亦深爲明瞭。而英國負責半數之印緬補給路線，毫無發展，故渝方要求美國之海洋種等路線，深爲股切，足證美軍在巾國大陸登陸，必將成爲事實。同時美國企圖完全支配中國問題，如史蒂威爾，捷諾　等之調任，均因美國之對華政策，由於作戰上之種種問題，及美軍與軍事機關所施之壓力，發生磨擦所致。</p>
<h3 id="c24">敵謀攫取各種權益 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>人　擬在中國及東亞獲得發言權，目謀較渝政權更有權威起見，聲稱攫取沿海區域，并非爲渝軍，而應由美軍負責。且要求在相當期間內，予美軍駐屯及美軍機關之有所活動，而美國最低之企求程度，則謀獲取戰前英國在華之利益。以英美兩國立塲之更調，使英國退讓在華之機會均等優越位置。　戰後美國之工業市場，僅爲巾國而已。由於軍需工業轉變爲利平產業之時，恐慌之美國，依賴軍火租借法，迫使渝方負担戰後美國商品進口之義務，在中國市塲自由貿易。故美國對渝方之要求軍炎租借物資，援助等等越多，則愈願樂助。在此企圖之下，美軍必登陸攫取中國各海岸。至戰後中國之復興費用，需美金三十五億元，月前渝方大多依賴國外之貸款，故美國目見渝方亟需軍火租借，及戰後之復興，大施伎倆，冀圖在中國沾有權益。總之，美國絕對必在巾國大陸登陸，其原因在軍事上有必要之外，且尚抱有對渝方之政治上及經濟上之野心，實堪注意。</p>
<h3 id="c25">渡喜丹河日軍　拜受嘉獎詞　士氣激昂繼續勇戰巾 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>細甸前綠基地二十一日巾央社電緬甸方面日軍，乘豪雨強行渡過喜丹河，開始作戰以來，巳殺傷敵兵二千餘名，獲得赫赫戰果，令敵極爲恐怖，十八日拜受日皇對此甬戰賜予之嘉獎詞，引爲光榮感激之餘。全體將兵愈益堅定挺進報國之決心，士氣更爲昂揚，繼續勇戰。</p>

<h3 id="c26">決戰日本的再認識 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 白松</p>
<p>日本全體的國民在這本土決戰的關頭都奮然蹶起了。日本的特攻隊，不僅限於將校士卒，一億的國民的胸中都澎湃着特攻的精神。所謂特攻的精神，不僅表現於戰塲上，并且表現於軍需增產，糧食增產，以及共他防禦本土的一切工程。更進一步說，現在的日本，巳無前綫與後方，更沒有士兵與國民的分別，後方即前綫，國民皆士兵，整個的國家已形成了鐵壁似的堡壘。</p>
<p>我們在分析現在日本國內的體制，第一不能不提到的，使是「　勇地役法」的施行。在第八十七次臨時義會中，日本政府提出「　勇兵役法」，就得到了議會的協贊而通過，六月二十二日頒布了該法的施行令，施行規則，以及國民義勇　統　今。，即日起實施。這法令使　本全國國民感到非常的興奮，不論在什麽地方，不論在什麼職位，都與作戰直接發生了聯緊，各自負起保衛國家的光榮的使命。阿南陸相曾經在廣播中，說明本土決戰的意義：「未來的戰塲是祖宗神靈所集的皇國本土，并不是像從前補給困難兵力無用武之地的孤島。而敵美英渡大海而來反而包藏着極大的困難與苦惱。我們的兵器，彈藥等的補給固　然不必說，更具有踏着戰友的屍骸，排敵置前，不屈不撓的一億的戰友的後盾。在空中，水上或地上一切準備之戰鬥部面，有着欲戰而不得戰的幾百萬精銳，此次與國民諸君同時在這支援及後據之下可以斷行連續不斷的攻擊。」這一段話正說出日本本土決戰力量的根源所在，也就是指出國民義勇兵役法的立法精神。</p>
<p>第二點我們可以在此處特別提出的，使是日本軍需工塲的發展狀況。雖然敵機的空襲，　毀了日本不少的建築，破壞了日本機個大規　都市的一部份，司是在決戰時期，戰爭力量的發源，並不在大都市，而在分散各處的軍需工塲。現在日本已有不少大規模的飛機工塲在地下繼續進行工作，也有述敵機空襲時的警報都聽不　的工　，日夜都可以安心努力　　。鵝的工塲就是不在地下也疏散在高山　　，茂林　鄉之中，不要說敵機很難找到目標，就是日本國民之間也各自努力於本位工作，雖然機　之聲相聞，也不相往來，不相過問。有的工場雖然不在地下，也不在偏僻之區，可是有極精巧的偽裝，能避渦敵機的偵察，或是有極堅固的防彈防火設備，使敵機投彈的效能減少。所以日本的大都市愈彼破　，國民的敵愾心愈激昂，而愈努力於軍需生產工作，可以說。日本的軍需生產不但沒有因爲敵機的轟炸而減弱，并且反而因此有增加的趨向。</p>
<p>第三，我們對於日本各大都市被災的市民不但可以同情，并且有足以使我們尊敬的地方。地們於家宅被炸之後，疏散到四鄉的，有的參加軍需生產的工作，有的從事農耕，以補農村勞働力之不足。本來大少是消費生活的市民，至此都成爲生產陣營中的生力部隊。他們不但沒有消極，沒有悲觀，并且拋棄了一切私的　掛而盡心竭力從事報國的事業。更有久居都市的人，就是房屋被炸也不願離開，便在轟炸的灰墟中從事開墾的工作，搭起帳蓬，或是造些簡單的小屋，一而安身，一面爲久居的都市　續盡共市民的防護責任。這種情形都足以表現日本民族堅靱的生命力量，這種耐苦忍勞，不屈不撓的精神眞是日本戰意旺盛的象微。</p>
<p>第四，我們更不能不注意日本靑年學生的力量。在「戰時教育令」實施以來，日本的教員和學生結成一氣，他們的教室便是工場和農村，他們的工作便是軍需增　與糧食增產，生活，教育，與報國道三者是一體的。無論農村或工塲都因爲有這許多靑年的學生參加，生出了蓋番新生的氣象。在後方的靑年學生，也和前綫的特攻隊一樣的奮鬥着。這是「知行合一」的教育的眞而目，也是「生聚教訓」的精義充分發揮的最高峯。</p>
<p>日木明治維新的先覺吉田松陰曾經說道：「　夷興來雖謂團家之大事，然而不是以深憂，所足深憂者爲人心之不正，人心既正，百死以守國。」日本今日決戰的體制，的確因爲全國國民趨向之正確，而愈見其站固。敵美於冲繩戰後，不敢貿然作本土登陸作戰的原因也就在此。我們對於決戰的日本必須有深切的認識，然後可以堅定我們的信念。我們對於決戰的日本的認識不能只憑臆測，也不能妄總流言蜚語，必須從日本眞實的姿態，去認識日的決戰力量。旅行通訊</p>
<h3 id="c27">浙省新政分析 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者湯毅</p>
<p>觀察浙江新政的浮　，好像浙當　的努力，傾注在揚湯止沸的工作上，如取蹄貪汚勒索，平抑物價。記者此次赴浙，在昤敎當政者意見之餘，還與各方人士接觸，研究浙省宮局的治浙方針與步驟。我的感覺是這樣：浙省目前的困難，在物資缺乏，物價暴漲，民生困苦，盜賊橫行，財政据拮，總括說一句是經濟上的困難。而丁默邨氏之治浙，却是從軍事出發，以政治爲手段，以經濟民生爲依歸的。</p>
<h3 id="c28">治浙方針 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>試研究當前結　，可以發現三點：　物資流通不暢，交通閉塞，若干交通綫的治安不能確立。　離城離主要交通綫較遠之處，受到各色部隊滋愛，受不住敲詐的農民，富足者棄田他往，貧苦者根本缺乏耕種的資本，　園　　，生產減少。　太　盆地的吳興長的是米糧產地，爲新四軍把持，實行所謂糧盒對　政策。因之新浙江當局似乎第一步想先「趕走」邊境的新四軍，將產米區確保在自己的封鎖機內。第二步肅淸境內游匪，同時修復公路，開通水道，以暢運輸，並樹立政治上的威信，第三步實行田賦微實，以所得提高軍警團隊及公務員的待遇，使之不再擾民。這種推測，不是全無根據的，我們從下述車實上，可以想像而知。</p>
<h3 id="c29">確立治安 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>浙省治安在東南諸省中要算壞的一省，今年初官方所獲情報，新四軍自江北，江南，淮南潛入浙境的很多，不時與渝軍衝突，爭奪地盤。丁氏主浙後，認爲治安不確立，任何問題談不到。因此發動防軍展開掃蕩戰，在盟軍全力協助之下，在六月上中兩旬中獲得極大成就，丁氏的計　似乎以杭州爲中心，第一先打通吳興德淸之綫，這一步已經完成，次之，是打通杭州至富陽之簇，不久亦司達到目的。然後進而確保長興。武康。臨安。富陽以東的區域，鞏固浙西邊境防禦緩。以浙省駐軍實力的雄厚，這一計劃自不難完成。據說盤鋸在長典吳興武康一帶的新四軍，西受渝軍威脅，東受國軍與盟邦部隊的攻擊，北面是無路可走的太湖，已不得不見機向南退入天目山了。天目山地處浙皖交界，作戰相當困難，故今後的發展，角極堪注目。</p>
<h3 id="c30">恢復交通 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>緊接著軍事行動，第二步是恢復　通。如杭州吳興之間，除水道業已恢復外，公路已在地方部隊與各該縣政府合力之下，作初步的修理，橋樑也在整理中。將來杭富公路的軍事行動完成，修路阿作也將開始。浙江省政府爲適應需要，在省府下增設一公路局，由丁省長自兼局長，可見重視一斑。除了以上兩條路外，尙鵝杭州至桐鄉公路，及桐鄉至　涇公路，都已著手修建，若千工程，正在招商投標。記者與丁省長談起時，丁省長說：『雖然所費甚多，但決定做了再講」</p>
<h3 id="c31">增產糧食 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>過去浙省食糧本不夠自給，再因產米區長興吳興方面的食糧被封鎖，浙省民食很恐慌，糧價一度竄到百萬，比上海還高，現雖因國府開放米　而歸於平復，在新米尚未登塔以前，供求決不能相符。省政府正在鼓勵民衆種雜糧雜糧，已收一部分效果。今後　區治安如能確保農民歸田耕作，嚴重一時的糧食恐慌，必可因此抒解，今年的田賦徵實，也必可順利推行，軍隊及公務員的給養有着，貪汚勒索之風，當不難剷除。</p>
<h3 id="c32">丁氏作風 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>浙省新政分析起來大體循着上述路綫。現在用一段對白來結束這幾篇旅浙通訊罷。談話的對象是個省政府的衛士，據他說在王省長時代便來了。他已看見省府換了很多主人。杭州的天氣熱得出奇，我汗濕了幾重衣服，不禁喊一聲「眞熱！」那個衛士脫口回答說：「我還好。」接着望望自己僅穿着汗背心。不好意思地爲自己解釋道：</p>
<p>「這個省長可怪，不講究這些，祗要做事，穿不　汗背心沒有關係。辦公的先生早上八點來，下午一點去。咱們得陪着省長和高級人員滴汗，天天大清早來，飯也吃在這裹，熬到天黑七八點鐘省長回云才散。就說禮拜天，選還要開什　談話會，地開老半天，下午才得回去。」</p>
<p>衛十說這話，希望得到一個陌生客人的同悄，然而他不，他在想另一個人，這個人有着蒼白的臉色。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十一日中央社電據倫敦路透社記者旁特著稱：三頭會議在出示大批如何管理或戰後德國之詳細方策時，應注意刻下英美蘇三國意見未能一致者，並非在如何使德國人在聯合國當局應駛之下治理德國之原則，而在選擇德國之人員及德國之政黨。目前德國數省政府，以同一權限管理三大地區，按該三區之面積變將估整個德國之領土。所謂英美管理地區當局與蘇聯管理地區當局之不同處，並非在管理地區當局之權限鵝異，而在各當局之組織黨方面鵝殊。在德國西部無共黨人員能鵝高過本地官員之地位及權勢。在巴伐利亞及南萊因區所鵝要職，均爲右翼天主敎政黨人員所佔鵝，在漢堡及漢諾感無黨派商人與右翼平民均　斷大權。社會民主黨領袖在整個海雪與整個中部萊因區，同時又在西法利亞及奧爾登堡，於右翼天主教政黨及激進黨領導之下，　持統治權。在東部地區之管理政府內，執政者包括四人至六人，其巾共黨社民黨中產階段人員均有，而在德國東部各管理政府內之執政官員，在名義上均係由西部各政黨所派出之代表人員，然在實際上其政黨本身均被公開擯出。在西部之各軍政府生管官員，藉「管理便利」爲名，擯斥一般反納粹主義委員會人員及公益機關組織人員，同時所謂「商會」者。實係一中立性之政黨組機，其中有三大政黨合成，即社會民主，共產，及天主敎，而蘇聯却準允各德國反法西斯主義黨自由活動，鵝時竟需視或領導彼等行動。總之，整個德國各地管理當局之霸勢政黨，均不能獲得一致。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Balikpapan Front Stalemate: Japanese Forces Mount Strong Counterattack; Fierce Cannon Battle on the Samalinda Highway Front <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>From a forward base in the south, a 21st Central News Agency dispatch reports that Japanese forces in the Balikpapan area continue to fight fiercely. They are currently holding the area near the Wakangan River waterway, a line 8 kilometers east of Samalinda, and the hilly area behind the Sepinngan airfield, preventing the enemy from advancing. Due to the ingenious Japanese battle plan, enemy casualties are increasing daily, and the front is in a stalemate. Although the Wakangan River waterway temporarily fell into enemy hands, Japanese forces immediately launched a night attack, wielding swords and decimating the enemy troops there, retaking the territory. The enemy widely admits to the difficult battle conditions, saying: the Japanese counterattacks are extremely strong, the front is now completely stalemated, and casualties are soaring. Several enemy small aircraft have begun landing at Sepinngan airfield, but the enemy fears Japanese night attacks, and the areas around the material warehouses are brightly lit at night. Furthermore, near the Anakitara pier on the Balikpapan coast and near the Nirashi mountain area, the enemy is urgently constructing defensive positions. Japanese soldiers are now utilizing their sweat and blood-forged rich reserves of fuel and various new weapons to destroy enemy positions. In particular, in areas where Japanese forces are stationed, many enemy soldiers have been killed, so the enemy is intimidated by the power of Japanese weapons and their morale is declining daily.</p>
<p>From a southwestern Pacific base, a 21st Central News Agency dispatch reports that on the Balikpapan front, on the 15th, enemy forces attacking the Samalinda highway front engaged in fierce fighting with two enemy platoons around 7:00 PM that afternoon, annihilating one platoon. The enemy forces shelled Japanese positions with mortars, tank cannons, and field guns throughout the day, but made no significant progress. Also, at the Lianshan area, around 7:30 PM that afternoon, Japanese forces annihilated approximately 50 enemy soldiers. Enemy forces on other fronts also showed no significant activity. Japanese forces are engaging in intense close-quarters combat daily.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Newspaper Article Discusses: Homeland Air Supremacy <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<h3 id="e3">Quietly Awaiting the Opportunity to Strike Back <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that recently, enemy aircraft and fleets have wantonly ravaged the Japanese homeland, causing Japanese citizens to gnash their teeth in anger. However, the Japanese military has not simply stood by and watched this arrogant enemy run rampant. Regarding this, the Yomiuri Shimbun featured a "Homeland Decisive Battle Theory" on the 20th, and the Asahi Shimbun published opinions on the front page on the 19th. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that B-29 heavy bombers will increasingly attack Japan in the future, but Japan's homeland air supremacy has absolutely not been surrendered to the enemy. Even if the Japanese homeland is under constant bombing by enemy aircraft, forcing 100 million Japanese citizens to be impoverished and live in the mountains and caves, facing the worst possible situation, we still firmly believe that control of the Japanese homeland's skies is firmly in the hands of the Japanese military and will be fought to the end. Indeed, to achieve their ambition of seizing air supremacy, the enemy will rely on its material advantage to challenge us to a war of attrition. At the same time, in order to deplete Japanese air combat strength, they will frequently raid us. Therefore, in some areas, Japanese air supremacy may appear weak, or Japanese air combat may temporarily lack vigor. However, because Japanese air combat strength is already at a disadvantage, we must wait for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to engage the enemy and avoid unnecessary waste. Regarding enemy aircraft invading the homeland, we can only endure and gnash our teeth, striving to build up our air power. The Japanese Air Force must deeply understand that there will be a day when they can strike and destroy enemy aircraft to avenge today's humiliation. The Asahi Shimbun stated that because the enemy cannot achieve its tactical goal of depleting Japanese air combat strength, it is making every effort to disrupt Japanese land and sea transportation lines, bombing military facilities, and bombing urban areas. In particular, the enemy believes that naval bombardment can shake public morale, so they appear on the sea at any time and any place in a guerrilla fashion. We must have adequate countermeasures for this and be prepared to prevent public morale from wavering. The Japanese Air Force has great expectations for dealing with the enemy's mobile units, so it is adopting a strategy of patience and restraint. Although the enemy is taking advantage of favorable weather conditions to run rampant, we are avoiding the futile loss of troops and quietly awaiting the opportunity to strike back at the enemy.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that approximately 100 enemy P-51 aircraft, on the 20th at noon, mainly targeted the Toyohashi and Okazaki areas, with a portion operating in the northern Nagoya area. For about an hour and a half, they retreated south from the Ise Bay area. Enemy aircraft strafed several locations with machine guns, causing very minor damage.</p>
<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that the enemy mobile units that came to the Kanto region around the 10th of this month later turned north and attacked the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th. After that, they returned to attack the southern part of the Tohoku region and the Kanto region. During this period, enemy warships approached the Japanese coast and bombarded Muroran, Kamaishi, and coastal cities in Ibaraki. The enemy aircraft that repeatedly attacked totaled approximately 4,800. Japanese ground fire shot down 164 enemy aircraft and damaged over 100. This time, the enemy's naval and air power was about 1,000, but 20% of it has already been consumed.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo reports that the Japanese military, in order to fully prepare for the decisive battle on the homeland, previously transferred the authority over short-distance land transportation, managed by the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Transportation, to the Army Ministry. Now, a new Land Transport Department has been established within the ministry, specializing in the affairs under the jurisdiction of the former Ministry of Transportation's Automobile Bureau. The Land Transport Department is divided into General Affairs, Administration, and Maintenance Sections. Major General Hajime Nakamura has been appointed as the department head. Personnel for each section will be selected and appointed from the Army, Navy, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and Ministry of Health and Welfare, and will be individuals with rich transportation experience and proven abilities.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports that as the American air raids on the Japanese homeland intensify, the sacrifices are also increasing. However, the United States, being a country that highly values life, is making great efforts in rescuing downed pilots. According to reports from the Pacific enemy strategic air force authorities announced on the 19th that in the six months leading up to June of this year, the Mariana-based air rescue team has rescued over 600 downed aircrew from within the Japanese maritime zone. The majority were B-29 aircrew who had fallen into the sea. Thousands of B-29 crew members were forced to land at the Iwo Jima base. According to reports, 68% of these rescue operations were jointly undertaken by aircraft and transport ships. However, the work is extremely vast. On average, rescuing one person requires a search of 3,300 kilometers. The round-trip distance for rescue aircraft is actually 22,016,000 kilometers.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports, according to a Washington dispatch: Wei Daoming, the Chongqing ambassador to the United States, after meeting with acting Secretary of State Grew on the 19th, also met with a group of journalists, warning the world that we should not be optimistic about the future of the war, because American and British propaganda agencies are enthusiastically broadcasting "particularly favorable" news about the bombing of the Japanese homeland and naval bombardment, leading to a general sense of pride and complacency among the public. Therefore, in the future, the public must be made aware that Japan's war strength is still formidable, in order to correct the public's past perceptions.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports, according to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen stated at the National Political Council on the 20th that in order to plan for post-war reconstruction, the government will be immediately reorganized and, for the sake of developing industry and the economy, is working hard to negotiate mutual benefits with the United States. Regarding the Moscow talks, he stated that there were no definite cases yet. As for what Song meant by "immediate government reorganization," whether it was to establish a democratic coalition government in response to the demands of the left wing, or simply to readjust the Chongqing camp, people from all walks of life in Chongqing are still in the dark. In short, Song's statement was intended to appease the voices of those criticizing the Kuomintang.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon reports, according to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, on the 18th, 199 members of the Chongqing National Political Council were present, and 170 jointly passed a resolution requesting the government to seek the following policies before convening the National Assembly: 1. Chongqing must be unified. 2. Legal status should be granted to parties other than the Kuomintang. 3. Freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association should be permitted. 4. Wartime organizations in local provinces and districts should be organized. When discussing the above requirements, although there was fierce opposition to setting the date for convening the National Assembly as November 12, there was no direct denial of the provisional date decided at the Kuomintang Sixth National Congress. As for the final decision on the convening date, it seems to have been left to the government's discretion, so the convening of the assembly is likely to be postponed.</p>

<p>A 21st Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm reports, according to a Reuters correspondent in Rome, politically motivated strikes and riots have been occurring frequently in the central region of northern Italy in recent weeks. The main reason for these actions is the local population's dissatisfaction with the measures implemented by the Allied occupation authorities. On Wednesday, in the Turin area, a group of demonstrators attacked the "Giornale" news agency and the "Fiat" automobile company, which was established during the fascist era. After extensively vandalizing both locations, they demonstrated in front of the United Nations military headquarters in Venice and the surrounding areas. On Thursday, there was a general strike in opposition to the Allied authorities' policies regarding issues of honor. The general strike in Trieste on Wednesday is said to have been backed by a coalition of the Italian Communist Party and Tito supporters.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports, according to a TASS dispatch from Brussels: As Belgium is currently discussing the issue of King Leopold, the Belgian newspaper "Le Peuple" has published new materials regarding the King's relationship with the Hitler party. The newspaper, citing reliable sources, stated that the Belgian King decided to leave Belgium a few days before the Allied forces landed in France. Even before Belgium was about to be liberated, the King was still negotiating with others regarding this matter. The King adopted this decision out of fear that after the failure of Hitler's Germany, those who had previously supported Germany would suffer. The same motive prompted him to refuse to reside in Belgium or flee the country with the help of the Allies. The newspaper also claimed that the King made comparisons extremely unfavorable to the Allies when comparing the Allied forces with the situation under German occupation.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Team held a regular press conference yesterday morning (the 21st), during which he made the following remarks to reporters in this city regarding the issue of the enemy and the United States attempting to realize a landing operation on the Chinese mainland:</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Problem of Landing on the Chinese Mainland <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The issue of the American military attempting to carry out a landing operation on the mainland has been quite noteworthy recently. Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing met with foreign reporters at the end of June. In his speech to the soldiers and civilians on the eighth anniversary of the "War of Resistance," and during the meeting with the National Political Council, he openly expressed three times that he did not welcome the American military landing on the Chinese mainland. Chen Cheng, also at the end of June meeting with foreign reporters, expressed the hope that American economic aid would be superior to the landing of the American military. However, the American side has not expressed anything to the Chongqing regime regarding this issue of landing on the Chinese mainland. I believe that the American military landing on the Chinese mainland has nothing to do with the strategy of attacking the Japanese homeland, and is the launch of another American attempt.</p>
<h3 id="e22">A Glimpse of Recent American and Chongqing Public Opinion <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Since General Wedemeyer took over as commander, he established the U.S. Military Headquarters in the China Theater at the end of June, and the Chongqing Military Affairs Department also participated in it. Presumably, as an American military organ, it intends to prepare to connect with the Chongqing intelligence organs after seizing the Japanese-occupied areas. In order to implement the political schemes made to spy on various cities, it has convened specialists from four important coastal cities in eastern China to discuss various tasks the American military will carry out during landing and occupation. Recently, American and Chongqing public opinion has expressed the deep hope that the American and Chongqing armies will shake hands on the Chinese coast. On the 12th of this month, the Chongqing radio broadcast claimed: If the southeast coast is occupied, a maritime transportation line with the American and British armies can be established immediately, and the necessary supplies can also be supplied immediately. The daily transportation volume gained will be superior to the monthly transportation volume of the Stilwell Road.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Reasons for the American Military's Attempt to Land <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>If the American military cannot land on the Chinese mainland, then the political ambition of America to extend its clutches to East Asia will completely come to naught. There are three reasons: The so-called general counteroffensive of the Chongqing army will only become a reality with the coastal supply assistance of the United States due to the insufficient supplies of the Stilwell Road, which is clearly understood by the Chongqing side as well. The British, who are responsible for half of the supply routes in India and Burma, have made no progress at all, so the Chongqing side is requesting marine supply routes from the United States, which clearly proves that the American military landing on the Chinese mainland will inevitably become a reality. At the same time, the United States is attempting to completely control the China issue. The transfers of Stilwell, Chennault, etc., were all caused by frictions due to various operational problems and the pressure exerted by the American military and military organs on American policy towards China.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Enemy Seeks to Seize Various Rights and Interests <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>In order to gain a voice in China and East Asia, and to aim for a more authoritative position than the Chongqing regime, the United States claims that the coastal areas should be seized, not by the Chongqing army, but by the American military. It also requests that the American military be stationed for a considerable period of time and that American military organs be allowed to operate. The lowest level of American ambition is to seek the interests that Britain held in China before the war. The change in the positions of Britain and the United States gives Britain the opportunity to concede its equal and superior position in China. China is the only industrial market for the United States after the war. At the time when the military industry is transforming into a civilian industry, the anxious United States, relying on the Lend-Lease Act, forces the Chongqing side to bear the obligation of importing American goods into China after the war, and to implement free trade in the Chinese market. Therefore, the more the United States requires aid, Lend-Lease materials, etc. from the Chongqing side, the more willing it is to help. Under this scheme, the American military will inevitably land and seize the coasts of China. As for the cost of China's reconstruction after the war, it requires 3.5 billion U.S. dollars. In the past, the Chongqing side mostly relied on foreign loans, so the United States, seeing that the Chongqing side urgently needs Lend-Lease materials and post-war reconstruction, uses tricks and schemes in an attempt to acquire rights and interests in China. In short, the United States absolutely must land on the Chinese mainland. Apart from the military necessity, it also holds political and economic ambitions towards the Chongqing side, which is worthy of attention.</p>

<h3 id="e26">A Re-understanding of the Decisive Battle with Japan <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Song</p>
<p>The entire Japanese nation has risen up valiantly at this critical juncture of a decisive battle on their homeland. Japan's special attack units are not limited to officers and soldiers; the spirit of special attacks surges in the hearts of all one hundred million citizens. This so-called spirit of special attacks is not only manifested on the battlefield but also in increased military production, increased food production, and all other projects to defend the homeland. Furthermore, in present-day Japan, there is no distinction between the front lines and the rear, nor between soldiers and civilians. The rear is the front line, and all citizens are soldiers. The entire country has formed an iron-clad fortress.</p>
<p>In analyzing the current system within Japan, the first thing that must be mentioned is the implementation of the "Volunteer Military Service Law." At the 87th Extraordinary Session of the Diet, the Japanese government proposed the "Volunteer Military Service Law," which was approved with the Diet's consent. On June 22nd, the enforcement ordinance, enforcement rules, and the national volunteer unit system were promulgated and implemented immediately. This decree caused great excitement among the people of Japan. No matter where they were or what their position, they were directly connected to the war effort and took on the glorious mission of defending the country. Minister of War Anami once explained the significance of the decisive battle on the homeland in a radio broadcast: "The future battlefield is the sacred homeland where the ancestral spirits reside, not isolated islands with difficult supplies and useless troop strength as before. The enemy, the United States and Britain, comes across the ocean, which contains great difficulties and suffering. Our supplies of weapons, ammunition, etc., are assured. Moreover, we have the support of one hundred million comrades who will step over the corpses of their comrades, push the enemy back, and never yield. In the air, on the water, or on the ground, in all prepared combat fronts, we have millions of elite troops eager to fight. This time, with the support and backing of all the citizens, we can launch continuous attacks." This statement precisely describes the source of Japan's strength in the decisive battle on the homeland and points out the legislative spirit of the National Volunteer Military Service Law.</p>
<p>The second point we can particularly highlight here is the development status of Japan's military supply factories. Although enemy aircraft have destroyed many buildings in Japan and damaged parts of several major cities, the source of war power during the decisive battle period is not in the big cities but in the military supply factories scattered everywhere. Currently, Japan has many large-scale aircraft factories continuing to work underground, and there are factories where they can't even hear the air raid sirens, allowing them to work diligently day and night. Even if the factories are not underground, they are dispersed in the high mountains, dense forests, and countryside. Not only is it difficult for enemy planes to find their targets, but even the Japanese people each work hard at their own tasks, not interacting or inquiring about others' work, even if they hear the sounds of machinery. Some factories, although not underground and not in remote areas, have extremely clever camouflage to avoid enemy reconnaissance, or they have extremely solid bulletproof and fireproof equipment to reduce the effectiveness of enemy bombing. Therefore, it can be said that the more Japan's major cities are destroyed, the more the people's anti-enemy spirit is aroused, and the more they work hard at military production. Japan's military production has not only not weakened due to enemy bombing but has even shown a tendency to increase as a result.</p>
<p>Third, we can not only sympathize with the citizens of Japan's major cities who have been affected by the disasters but also find aspects worthy of our respect. After their homes were bombed, those who evacuated to the countryside either participated in military production or engaged in farming to supplement the insufficient rural labor force. Originally, they were city dwellers who primarily engaged in consumption, but now they have all become vital forces in the production camp. They are not only not passive or pessimistic but have also abandoned all personal concerns and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to the cause of serving the country. Moreover, even those who have lived in the cities for a long time are unwilling to leave even after their houses have been bombed. Instead, they engage in reclamation work in the bombed-out ruins, set up tents, or build simple huts to settle down and continue to fulfill their protection responsibilities as long-time residents of the cities. This situation fully demonstrates the tenacious life force of the Japanese nation. This spirit of enduring hardship and not yielding is truly a symbol of Japan's vigorous fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must also pay attention to the power of Japanese young students. Since the implementation of the "Wartime Education Ordinance," Japanese teachers and students have united as one. Their classrooms are factories and farms, and their work is to increase military production and food production. Life, education, and serving the country are integrated into one. Whether in the countryside or in factories, the participation of these many young students has created a completely new atmosphere. The young students in the rear are fighting just as hard as the special attack units on the front lines. This is the true embodiment of the education of "unity of knowledge and action" and the highest peak of fully demonstrating the essence of "development, accumulation, education, and training."</p>
<p>Yoshida Shōin, a visionary of the Meiji Restoration, once said: "The rise of the barbarians is said to be a major national event, but it is not a cause for deep concern. What is deeply concerning is the dishonesty of the people's hearts. Once the people's hearts are honest, they will defend the country even at the cost of a hundred deaths." Japan's current system for the decisive battle is indeed becoming more and more solid because the whole nation is moving in the right direction. This is also the reason why the enemy, the United States, dared not rashly launch a landing operation on the homeland after the Battle of Okinawa. We must have a deep understanding of Japan, which is determined to fight the decisive battle, so that we can strengthen our beliefs. Our understanding of Japan's determination to fight the decisive battle cannot be based on mere speculation or rumors. We must understand Japan's decisive battle power from its true state.

<h3 id="e27">Analysis of the New Policies in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Tang Yi of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Observing the superficial aspects of the new policies in Zhejiang Province, it seems that the efforts of the Zhejiang authorities are focused on addressing urgent problems, such as curbing corruption and extortion and stabilizing prices. During this trip to Zhejiang, in addition to inquiring about the opinions of those in power, I also made contact with people from all walks of life to study the Zhejiang Provincial Government's policies and steps for governing Zhejiang. My feeling is this: Zhejiang Province's current difficulties lie in the shortage of materials, soaring prices, the hardship of the people's livelihood, rampant bandits, and financial difficulties. In short, the difficulty is economic. However, Ding Mocun's governance of Zhejiang starts from military affairs, uses politics as a means, and relies on the economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Governing Principles of Zhejiang <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Examining the current situation, three points can be identified: 1. The flow of goods is not smooth, transportation is blocked, and the security of some transportation lines cannot be established. 2. In areas far from the city and main transportation lines, farmers are abused by various troops. Those who cannot withstand extortion abandon their fields and move elsewhere, while the poor lack the capital for cultivation. Gardens are abandoned, and production is reduced. 3. Wuxing in the Taihu Basin is a major rice-producing area, controlled by the New Fourth Army, which implements the so-called grain exchange policy. Therefore, it seems that the new Zhejiang authorities want to first "drive away" the New Fourth Army from the border area and ensure that the rice-producing area is within their own blockade. The second step is to eliminate bandits within the territory, while repairing highways and opening waterways to facilitate transportation and establish political prestige. The third step is to implement light tax collection on farmland to use the proceeds to improve the salaries of military police teams and civil servants so that they no longer harass the people. This conjecture is not without basis. We can imagine this from the following facts.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Establishing Security <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's security is among the worst in the southeastern provinces. At the beginning of this year, the official intelligence revealed that many New Fourth Army soldiers had infiltrated Zhejiang from Jiangbei, Jiangnan, and Huainan, constantly clashing with Chongqing troops to seize territory. After Ding took charge of Zhejiang, he believed that without establishing security, any other issue was out of the question. Therefore, he launched a campaign by the defense forces to carry out a sweeping operation. With the full assistance of the Allied forces, great achievements were made in the first half of June. Ding's plan seems to be centered on Hangzhou. The first step is to open the line between Wuxing and Deqing, which has already been completed. The next step is to open the line from Hangzhou to Fuyang, which will also soon be achieved. Then, they will proceed to secure Changxing, Wukang, Lin'an, and the area east of Fuyang to consolidate the defense of the western Zhejiang border. Given the strength of the Zhejiang Provincial Army, this plan should not be difficult to complete. It is said that the New Fourth Army, entrenched in the Changxing, Wuxing, and Wukang areas, is threatened by Chongqing troops to the west and attacked by the National Army and Allied forces to the east. With the boundless Taihu Lake to the north, they have no choice but to retreat south into Tianmu Mountain. Tianmu Mountain is located at the intersection of Zhejiang and Anhui, making combat quite difficult, so future developments are highly noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Restoring Transportation <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Following the military action, the second step is to restore transportation. For example, between Hangzhou and Wuxing, in addition to the waterway that has already been restored, the highway is undergoing preliminary repairs under the joint efforts of the local troops and the respective county governments, and bridges are also being renovated. In the future, when the military action on the Hangzhou-Fuyang highway is completed, road repair work will also begin. To meet the needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has established a Highway Bureau under the Provincial Government, with Governor Ding concurrently serving as the Bureau Chief, which shows the importance attached to it. In addition to the above two roads, the Hangzhou-Tongxiang highway and the Tongxiang-Shanghai highway have also been started, and some projects are being tendered for bidding. When the reporter spoke with Governor Ding, Governor Ding said: "Although it will cost a lot, we have decided to do it first and talk later."</p>
<h3 id="e31">Increasing Food Production <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>In the past, Zhejiang Province's food supply was insufficient to meet its own needs. Moreover, because the food supply in the rice-producing areas of Changxing and Wuxing was blockaded, Zhejiang's food supply was very strained, and grain prices once soared to one million, higher than Shanghai. Although it has now returned to normal due to the National Government's opening of rice sales, the supply and demand cannot be matched before the new rice is harvested. The provincial government is encouraging people to plant coarse grains, which has already had some effect. In the future, if security in the production areas can be ensured, allowing farmers to return to their fields and cultivate the land, the serious food panic that has been occurring can be alleviated, and this year's land tax collection can be successfully implemented. With adequate supplies for the military and civil servants, the practice of corruption and extortion will not be difficult to eradicate.</p>

<p>The analysis of the new policies in Zhejiang Province generally follows the above path. Now, let us end these few travel communications with a dialogue. The person being talked to is a provincial government guard who, according to him, came during Governor Wang's era. He has seen the Provincial Government change many masters. The weather in Hangzhou is exceptionally hot, and my clothes are soaked with sweat. I can't help but exclaim, "It's so hot!" The guard blurted out, "I'm alright." Then, looking at himself wearing only a sweaty undershirt, he explained embarrassedly:</p>
<p>"This Governor is strange. He doesn't care about these things. He only cares about getting things done. It doesn't matter if you wear an undershirt. The clerks come to the office at eight in the morning and leave at one in the afternoon. We have to accompany the Governor and senior officials and drip with sweat. We come early every morning, eat our meals here, and wait until the Governor returns to the cloud at seven or eight in the evening before we can leave. Even on Sundays, he still holds what-you-call discussion meetings that last half the day, and we can't go back until the afternoon."</p>
<p>The guard said this, hoping to gain the sympathy of a stranger. However, he did not. He was thinking of someone else, a person with a pale face.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, July 21st. According to a dispatch from Mr. Marding, a special correspondent for Reuters in Stockholm: It seems that Truman, Churchill, and Stalin have reached their major goals in the Potsdam talks. After the banquet on Wednesday, Churchill and Stalin held a secret meeting that lasted about three hours. The talks have now entered the second stage.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Disagreements Still Exist Regarding the Three-Power Rule of Germany <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, July 21st. According to a report by Reuters correspondent Ponte in London: When the Three-Power Conference issues a large number of detailed plans on how to manage post-war Germany, attention should be paid to the current disagreements among the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. These disagreements are not about the principle of how to make the Germans govern Germany under the control of the Allied authorities, but about the selection of German personnel and German political parties. Currently, the governments of several German provinces manage the three major regions with the same authority, and the territory of the entire Germany will be estimated according to the area of these three regions. The difference between the authorities managing the British and American regions and the authorities managing the Soviet region does not lie in the authority of the managing authorities, but in the organization of the parties. In western Germany, no Communist Party members can exceed the position and power of local officials. In Bavaria and the Southern Rhineland, the major positions are occupied by members of the right-wing Catholic political parties. In Hamburg and Hanover, non-partisan businessmen and right-wing civilians have the majority of power. Social Democratic Party leaders in the entire Hesse and the entire Central Rhineland, as well as in Westphalia and Oldenburg, hold the ruling power under the leadership of the right-wing Catholic political parties and radical parties. In the management government of the eastern region, the governing body includes four to six people, including Communist Party members, Social Democratic Party members, and middle-class personnel. In the management governments of eastern Germany, the governing officials are nominally representatives sent by the parties in the west, but in reality, their parties themselves are openly rejected. In the western military government, officials reject general anti-Nazi committees and public welfare organizations under the pretext of "administrative convenience," while the so-called "chambers of commerce" are actually neutral political party organizations composed of the three major parties: Social Democrats, Communists, and Catholics. However, the Soviet Union allows various German anti-fascist parties to operate freely and even needs to oversee or lead their actions from time to time. In short, the hegemonic parties of the management authorities throughout Germany cannot achieve consistency.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Soviet Union Appoints Heads of Two German Provinces <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency News According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin, the Soviet military government in Germany, the guidance committee of the state of Saxony and the state of Thuringia, consulted with the local autonomous governments for several days and submitted candidate lists for the heads and deputy heads of the administrative organizations of each province to the head of the Soviet military government. After consultation and study by Marshal Zhukov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany and head of the Soviet military government, he immediately approved the recommendations. He announced the appointment of Dr. Herbener, a doctor of economics, as the chairman of the administrative organization of the state of Saxony (before 1933, he worked in the administrative organs and was a member of the Democratic Party), and Ziefan as the vice chairman (he was a mason and a member of the Communist Party). The administrative organization of the state of Saxony is located in the city of Halle and has begun work. Dr. Burfel, a doctor of law, was appointed as the chairman of the administrative organization of the state of Thuringia (before 1933, he worked in the prosecutor's office and was a member of the Civil Life Party), and Buss was appointed as the vice chairman (before 1933, he was a lawyer and a member of the German Social Democratic Party). The administrative organization of the state of Thuringia is located in the city of Weimar and has also begun work.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, July 21st. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin: The four Allied military commanders stationed in Berlin have decided to take the same steps to strictly ban the black market transactions that are becoming increasingly rampant. At the same time, the local German police will also strive to eliminate the black market under the guidance of the Allied military authorities. All circles expect that the Allied military authorities will punish all those who specialize in illegal transportation of goods, regardless of whether they are military personnel from the Allied side or German civilians. However, the problem is not so simple. The main point is that there is a shortage of supplies in Berlin or in the entire Germany. In fact, this phenomenon of rampant black markets exists in all the so-called "liberated countries."</p>

Detailed measures are formulated by the Traffic Section of the Second Division and notified to each branch bureau and Baojia authority for accurate implementation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has another two cases of government personnel being corrupt, neglecting their duties, confusing the military, undermining the army's intentions, and committing embezzlement and neglect of duty, involving a total of seven criminals. After verification by the Criminal Investigation Section of the Third Division, it was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval by Chairman Chen, and yesterday (21st), Wu Xiangfu of the section escorted the criminals to the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court for trial. Details of the cases are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e47">Corruption, Neglect of Duty, Confusing the Military <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The facts of former Security Police Corps Commander Qu Jiuzhi committing neglect of duty are: (A) Embezzlement of funds, allegedly signing and receiving funds on behalf of others and failing to distribute them. Encroachment on desertion pay, more than 100,000 yuan of desertion pay in March of this year, allegedly distributed to officers of all levels of the Corps Headquarters except for less than 40,000 yuan that he kept for his own miscellaneous expenses. Reducing rice rations, allegedly deducting four catties from each load of rice when distributing rice rations to each team, in addition to the shortage of each stone of rice, about 70-80 per period, distributed to all officers of the Corps Headquarters. (B) Confusing the military and undermining the army's intentions have been verified and are subject to Article 12 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law and Article 2 and Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Government Employees for Corruption.</p>

<p>Wang Rongsheng, Chen Ziyu, and Hu Min, adjustment and subsidy staff of the Yingye Tax Madang Road District Collection Office of the Finance Bureau, have the case of Weng, manager of the Gongxing Company, Zhang Mingkai, manager of the Yuxiang Company, and Manager Ze Song of the Zhunde Company, paying bribes to the three offenders. After examination and verification by the Investigation Section, it was determined that the three civil servants violated Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Government Employees for Corruption, and the remaining three defendants violated Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Pastry, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Stick Industry Exempt from Business Tax <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Although members of the local pastry, steamed bun, and fried dough stick industry association primarily engage in producing foods such as large pastries, fried dough sticks, and steamed buns, most lack dedicated storefronts. Furthermore, due to the limited scope of their operations, they generally do not maintain registers to record business volume. Thus, while they may appear to be shops, they are in reality just households. In light of this situation, the industry association, based on the actual circumstances, submitted a request to the Municipal Government's Finance Bureau, which then forwarded it to the Municipal Government, seeking exemption from business tax for the large pastry, fried dough stick, and steamed bun industry to alleviate business hardship. This request has now been approved. Cash and cashier's checks are being handled separately for deposit and payment, which major banks and financial institutions have already implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Cash and Cashier's Checks Handled Separately for Deposit and Payment; Major Banks and Financial Institutions Already Implemented <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Due to the inability of local banks and financial institutions to widely supply cash, various institutions have issued parallel-line, immediately payable cashier's checks to circulate in the market, serving the same function as cash. However, when purchasing goods, many merchants have refused to accept them, leading to a worsening trend of profiteering and discounting by market speculators. Major banks and financial institutions with a long history, in order to facilitate customers and make every effort to supply cash, have, in addition to automatically increasing the weekly cash withdrawal ratio for depositors from 20% to 30%, also recently separated the cash and cashier's check deposit amounts for depositors. For those who deposit cash, when making payments, they are paid in full with cash. For those who deposit cashier's checks, they are still paid cash according to the weekly cash payment ratio. It is reported that this measure greatly helps the authorities reduce the practice of discounting. It is regrettable that the Bank and Financial Institution Association has not yet notified its members to implement this measure uniformly. Some stubbornly insist that bank cashier's checks are equivalent to cash, and that any losses from discounting are purely self-inflicted. This view seems to disregard the facts. If all banks and financial institutions could relax cash withdrawals for depositors, at least the discounting trend could be somewhat mitigated.</p>

<p>The Hongkou Swimming Pool, managed by the Municipal Health Bureau, held a grand opening ceremony yesterday (the 21st) at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Deputy Secretary-General Ze Wu representing Mayor Zhou, Lu Runzhi, Director of the Central Health Administration, and heads of various municipal agencies, Xu Jidun, Liu Xingchen, Yan Fuqing, Tatsui Senjin, Shoji Kita, and several hundred others. The ceremony was presided over by Yuan Jufan, Director of the Health Bureau, with Ms. Bai Guang cutting the ribbon. There were also swimming performances, creating a lively atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Director Yuan's Opening Remarks <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Today, we are holding the opening ceremony for the 34th summer season of the municipal swimming pool. I am honored to have Secretary-General Hu representing the Mayor, as well as heads of various bureaus and offices, and all the distinguished guests present. Swimming is a form of exercise that is extremely beneficial for strengthening the body and is especially suitable during the summer season. While there are swimming pools established by organizations and private individuals in the city, they have all been closed. Currently, only this municipal pool remains, which is insufficient to meet the needs of all the citizens of the city. If conditions permit in the future and other requirements are met, we will strive to add more facilities and vigorously promote swimming so that the public deeply understands the benefits of swimming as exercise and actively engages in practice. It is our hope that the health of all the citizens will improve daily.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Mayor's Representative Delivers Remarks <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Secretary-General Ze Wu delivered remarks on behalf of Mayor Zhou, stating in brief: The Municipal Government believes that promoting the health of citizens and advocating for physical education is of great significance, and the opening of the only Hongkou swimming pool in the city is of extreme importance.</p>
<p>At a time when materials are extremely scarce and the situation is very tense, the opening of this swimming pool is not merely a superficial display of peace and prosperity, but is actually intended to promote the health of citizens and further accomplish the mission of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, precisely because of the extreme scarcity of materials, we have used our best efforts and received assistance and cooperation from all sides to enable the swimming pool to open as scheduled. Therefore, we hope that all citizens and young men and women who love sports will make use of it, exercise their bodies, and not let this great opportunity pass by lightly, and not fail the Mayor and the health authorities in their efforts to promote physical education.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Make Utmost Efforts to Relieve Air Raid Victims <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Kind-hearted people from all walks of life sympathize with air raid victims, and donations for relief funds have been continuously pouring in. Even during air raid alarm periods yesterday, people enthusiastically sent donations to this office, demonstrating that the thought of doing good is deeply rooted in people's hearts. This spirit of human mutual aid is truly exciting. However, considering that air raids may become more frequent in the future, the need to actively promote relief work is urgent. Powerful individuals from all walks of life should make their utmost efforts to contribute generously to provide assistance and achieve significant results. The following are excerpts from letters received:</p>
<p>A letter from Shanghai Hefeng Products Company states: "Our city has suffered terrible damage. How can we, as colleagues, stand idly by in the spirit of human mutual aid? Therefore, we have collected a total of 2,150,000 yuan in group funds, including 1,000,000 yuan from our company, 500,000 yuan from Chengfu Company, and 250,000 yuan each from Yixinghang, Jingcheng Factory, Yongqinghang, and Hemaohang, to be donated to relief agencies."</p>
<p>A letter from the Tongyi Enterprise Co., Ltd. states: "Our city has suffered bombing, and we, the colleagues of our company, cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, we are contributing 1,000,000 yuan to assist our fellow compatriots who have been bombed, as a small token of our feelings. Although it is a drop in the bucket, we hope to inspire sympathy from all sectors of society and encourage generous contributions."</p>
<p>A letter from Chen Chengji states: "Our city has suffered bombing this time, and the disaster is terrible, with many people displaced and homeless, which is unbearable to witness. I cannot bear to stand idly by, so I am contributing 1,000,000 yuan for relief efforts, requesting that it be distributed as 500,000 yuan each to the Air Raid Relief Fund and the Pushan Hall, a small contribution to express my feelings."</p>

<p>The Yanglu Central Church of the Taoist Church, due to the terrible air disaster in the Hudong area, with many displaced victims, dispatched personnel on the 20th to distribute self-made pastries in the disaster area and plans to provide congee in the area.</p>
<p>Businessmen and residents of the disaster-stricken area in Hudong, Wang Boyuan, [Blank] Wang Hou, etc., jointly formed a temporary relief office with the Central Church of Taoist Church, and it has now been decided to implement relief work starting today. Relief procedures are divided into: registration, medical treatment of injuries, evacuation, small loans, and fundraising. The office is temporarily located in the China Hospital at Tilan Bridge. Individuals from all walks of life who wish to donate relief funds or goods can directly send them to the Central Church of Taoist Church on Tongfu Road.</p>
<p>The temporary relief committee of Jimin Hospital has received pledges of 240 million yuan, and yesterday began providing free medical treatment to citizens affected by air raids at the hospital at the end of North Xizang Road.
