<h3>日鈴木首相接見記者談記戰階段方針對三國共同宣言置諸不理</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　鈴木首相今日下午三時接見新聞記乾，前復亘一小時之久，答援各問題，關明日政府對付本土決戰階段之方針，披瀝必膀之信念，茲誌問答內容如下：</p>
<p>（問）國民之間似有希望政府對於敵人艦砲射擊本土及敵機動部隊之空襲轟炸，請求對紮之空氣，未知首相之戰局觀感如何？</p>
<p>（答）關於此點，最近各省曾加討論，由勗揚園民戰意而言，軍部關於此點，自有計劃，現在於此見解之下遂行作戰，故暫請靜候發展，此爲最鉉參謀總長所吿余者。余已答以可暫時不拘泥國民顧慮如何，儘量放膳做去，畫最善於作戰之逐行。以余個人言，甚望國民雜君不問驗局推移如何，對軍方抱絕對信賴，司時作戰部方面則有非常堅强之目信，請國民諾，得無後顧之憂。余亦深感責任重大，故　復思慮，以求最　，甚望一萬萬同胞各依　　，精勵盡忠，</p>
<p>（問）首相對三國共同宣言之所信如何？</p>
<p>（答）鄙見以爲三國共同宣實不過開羅會議之重演，政府不認其有任何價值，祗有置諸不理，遭進完成戰爭。</p>
<p>（問）糧食問題，因雜準數　減配，日見　濫，首相見解如何？</p>
<p>（答）糧食問題，政府實已多方設法，惟實際上雖訓減配給量一成，並非驗局已緊張至非立即實行減配一成之程度，面出於未雨綢繆之計耳。甚望國民充分協助政侑之施雜，政府方面自當訓倍努力，使國民之努力更見效果。</p>
<p>（問）戰局　　之際，政府之政治力强化　似爲重要之圖。</p>
<p>（答）關於政治力之强化、前曾實施決戰　制，頒布强力之緊急措置方策，使各種施策得以迅速見諸實行。其次，又將中央之權限讓與各地方總監府，依國民義勇隊之力量，遂行施策，凡此均爲政府對强化政治力之努力表示</p>
<p>（問）通貨膨脹問題及生活意識昂揚問題等，均宜以道義之確立爲基本，故最儀生活之確保，當爲先決條件，首相對此見解如何？</p>
<p>（答）遠義之確立，　應先有生活之確保，方　其全，政府對於糧食問題，已如前述，以最大努力，謀國民最低主要食糧之確保。本年秋收有望，擬於新榖登爲後，儘可能恢復以前之配給。衣服方面，幸各人均有相當存量，本年冬季當可安然渡過，政府亦已進行措優，以渡冬季。</p>
<p>（問）敵機空襲日甚一日，工廠損害異增，國民對於軍需品及其飛機之生產狀況，不無憂歟，首相所信如何？</p>
<p>（答）關於此點，因各方面異當努力，目爺地下工塲已收預料以上之成功，余近曾實地視察，深信絕無憂慮之必要。間有若干工廠，似已措置較遲，深爲抱歉，惟自今以後，預料必能增加相當生產力。現在果有多少生產能力，恕不能奉吿，惟可以吿諸位者，現在之生產力，早已超過國禺所担心及想像之程度，每月有數千架飛行機之製造，現在大部份已地下工塲化，工作人員亦於安全地帶安心工作，提高製造能率。有人担心地下工塲之空氣流通問題，然經余詢問，知九小時工作毫無嬰題，女子工作人員，亦異當活潑，從事生產，健康狀態亦極良好，工作能率大有增高。</p>
<h3>最近兩旬以還日迎擊戰果擊隊毀敵機四一八架</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　敵機動部隊自七月十日蟻居於本土近海以來，已屆二旬，執拗向日基地空軍尋釁，敵對於日本之視若無睹，極爲焦慮，以一部永上艦艇實施艦砲射擊，復覬訓交游機關之破壞等，顯永出邁向次期作戰之前哨作戰意圖。日方對此，於各地以戰鬥機及地上砲火，展開果敢之迎擊戰，由二十一日戰胤二十五日，計擊隊敵艦載機百五十架，擊破二十八深，自七月十日以來，共擎隊二百七十五架，擊破一百四十三架，合計四百十八架，以眾於本週中少迎擎目標，乃爲敵艦載機，故擊隊B29型機之戰果較少。</p>
<h3>B29型機　襲日東海道</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　B29型機約百二十架，二十八日下午八時半起，對福島縣平市及其四周地區施行燒夷彈攻擊，因此發生火災，日民衆防空陣積極將火勢撲減。另有B29型約六十架，二十八日下午一時左右侵入和歌山市附近，其他約百六十架侵入東海道地區，對一部都市投彈。</p>
<h3>B32型機　美開始使用</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美陸軍部二十八日發表稱：美陸軍航空隊新轟性機B29型，刻已開始使用，隸屬於籥治凱尼古將軍麾下之航空部隊，參加對日作戰。</p>
<h3>日全國强化　國民義勇隊</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日國災養勇隊自創始以來，於全義各地展開活動，努力於構築陳地，疏散工作，戰災地戰力化，糧食增產及協力運送等工作，內務省以泱戰階段已臨，爲强化活動計，昨特制定「國民義勇隊士氣勗揚實施綱要」，咨請各地方總監府及義勇隊本部長（鄴各地方長官（迅予實施，咨文之要點爲　勗揚義勇隊之精神，　貫澈義勇隊之任務，　整飭戰鬥隊員之陣容等三項。</p>
<h3>菲島納卯以北　日軍猛烈反擊　緬喜丹河右岸交戰中</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　東爺各地一週戰況如下：　南太平洋方面，峇厘巴板至三馬林達之戰綫，呈膠着狀態，敵得澳洲援兵後，時以砲擊及轟炸擾亂日軍前綫，並以少數兵力企圖繼續前進，然日軍機歟亦與陸上戰鬥相互協力，現正與敵　戰中。　菲律實方面，納卯以北一帶，依然在交戰中，因日軍反擎猛烈，敵已停止正面攻勢，而擬索得日軍弱點。　東印度洋方面，敵於二十五日砲擊泰屬浦開特島後，下午九時許，其中一部乘登陸舟艇開始登陸，然日軍則邀之於海上，予以重創，將之繫退。敵方兵力乃以巡洋艦二艘爲基幹之英國艦隊，二十六日下午三時許，敵之一部復由浦開特島南端附近登陸，而又被日軍繫退。是日下午九時，日特攻機攻擊敵艦船，擊沉其大型巡洋艦一艘，擊破空母或大型巡洋艦一艘，然而敵之艦艇現仍遊弋於近海一帶。　緬甸方面，喜丹河附近之敵軍反擊，漁漸增强，當地業入雨季，然敵當以戰鬥機掩護陸上部隊反擊作戰，但日軍仍能繼持喜丹河右岸堡壘，刻在交戰中。</p>
<h3>日航空隊協力峇厘巴板戰鬥</h3>
<p>南方基地二十九日中央社電　日航空隊于二十六·七兩日，協力峇厘巴板陸上戰鬥，攻擊敵陣地及物炎集積所，獲得重大戰果，即二十六日黎明對敵物炎集積所投下全部炸彈，予以重創。又二十七日冒在嬰敵之熾烈對空砲火，猛攻敵陣地後方，日機全部飛返。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十九日中央社電　峇厘巴猛烈反擊，不能積極行動，第一機敵軍僅有前哨戰，刻在三馬林達東方十公里至十四公里之間構築陣地，日軍曾晝夜出動突擊隊，使敵犧牲極大。</p>
<h3>浦開特島海面日特攻隊拼撞</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地二十九日中央社電　日特攻飛行隊，來攻浦開特島之敵機動部隊，發揮猛威，擊訊敵基幹之巡洋艦及大型艦各一艘，該情况已傳到基地。日特別攻擊隊於二十四日以來，即蓄銳待機攻敵，二十六日下午，冒不良天氣，突然出動，其一架突入之際，因中敵彈，致未成功，然此時之情况實不容猶豫，及至傍晚，特攻隊再度由基地出發，飛抵敵艦上空時，天氣仍極不佳，進攻實屬困難，下午八時五十分，德永·山本兩曹長各駕一機，分別向敵巡洋艦及大型艦各一艘施行拼撞，卒吿成功，轟沉一艘，擊毀一艘，其後據中島少尉機之偵察，確認擊毀之敵大型艦，大概爲航空母艦，不久即行沉沒。</p>
<h3>美戰艦「加利福尼亞」　在菲律賓海域受創</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　華盛頓來電，美海軍部二十七日發表如次：戰艦「加利福尼亞」號，於一月九日在菲律實海城巡日特攻機攻擊，而受重創，異下於普列馬頓海軍工塲修理中，其中兵員之損害，計陣亡四十五名，負傷一百十熊名，行踪不明者三各。</p>
<h3>我的必勝信念（二）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問　你說中日兩國資本主義發達程度相也不大，然而日本的商工業大有發達，其程度不能與中國同日而論。就是爲了這個理由，中鸚不是　着日本資本主義進入中國麼？</p>
<p>答　當然單說中日資本主義之間，其發達程度是有相當的差。然而我們可以知道與其他養本主義諸國，尤其與英美比較，中日兩國資本主義發達程度之差是不甚多大。兩者關係就是所謂「難兄難弟」。不，中日兩閱在這意味之下可謂「兄弟」之國。爲了更驗瞭這個事實請看下揭統計表。</p>
<p>英美與中日近代工業不可缺乏的鐵鑛出產額之比較美國</p>
<p>七三，○二八千噸英國</p>
<p>一八，九○○千噸滿洲國</p>
<p>一，○七○千噸中國</p>
<p>二五○千噸日本（本土及朝鮮）　八二八千噸</p>
<p>銑鐵出產額英國及印度</p>
<p>九·一一百萬噸美國四</p>
<p>一·九百萬噸滿洲國</p>
<p>○·五</p>
<p>百萬噸中國</p>
<p>○·五</p>
<p>百萬噸日本及朝鮮</p>
<p>一·九</p>
<p>百萬噸</p>
<p>鐵出產額美國　五六·四三百萬噸（一九二九年）英國</p>
<p>九·八四百萬噸（一九三五年）日本</p>
<p>四·越六百萬噸中國</p>
<p>○·○二百萬噸</p>
<p>煤炭出產額美國</p>
<p>五五二百萬噸英國</p>
<p>二六二百萬噸日本</p>
<p>四○百萬噸中國</p>
<p>一二百萬噸</p>
<p>（以上統計數額中，中國的數額憂根據卡薩寗的統計，其他是根據阿特烈的統計）</p>
<p>至於電力，日本有水力電力，然而中國的電力根本談不到。娛油產額，中日兩園都不足以提起。</p>
<p>煤炭·煤油·電力等的動力及雜力能代替人力做工作，若將其工作分量換算人力的工作分量，就可知道日本與中國的情形是怎樣的相類似。據李特的研究，他以兩磅煤炭作有効的使用之時，可抵一個人一天的勞動分量。三·五巴雨的煤油等於一噸煤炭，這樣假定之下，比較各國所有人口每一個人的機械及動力工作分量，而得到如下數字：美國人　每一人年　三十六人份之工作分量英國人　每人一年　二十四人份之工作分衍德國人　每人一年　十五人份之工作分量日本人　每人一年　二·二人份之工作分量中國人　每人一年　一·二人份之工作分量</p>
<p>（其他各國省略）</p>
<p>關於中日兩國的工業也有非當類似的現象。即兩國的輕工業都此較其他工業發達，並且輕工業的工廠中有極少數工人或徒弟的小工廠，即資本主義發達初期出現的所謂「Manufatuer（製造家）」比大工廠更多。據日本經濟學者高橋　吉統計，日本工業勞動者總數之大約百分之四十六，是不過有五人以下工人的小工廠——這不如說工作場——所雇用的，據一九二四年之調查，像大阪這樣近代的大工業都市，大約一萬九千家工廠中，其百分之六十八，即一萬三千是使用五人以下工人的工廠。關於中國雖然沒有明確的統計，然據卡薩寗調查，其出產棉紗的百分之八十五，生絲的百分之四十是以手織機加工的，棉織品國內消費的百分之五十以上是由依家庭勞動所佔。據說像上海演際近代工業都市也有「製造者」的數目達到工廠數之兩倍。</p>
<p>日本及中國被稱爲亞洲最進步的國家，要工業的程度不過如此。印度的情形比這個更壞。我想中日兩國應該共同考慮解放亞洲及亞洲共榮的經濟的理由即在於此。日本人常中有些人因爲日本工業稍比中國進步，目光眩惑而竟忘記解放亞洲的大目的，與英美同樣，努力中國殖民地化的工作，誠爲遺撼。然而如上所述日本中閱印度都有類似的經濟性格，即其內部殘存許多封建思想，從外部加以英美帝國主義的壓由。以中日兩國應如何處理這稱狀態爲出發點，才有實現「大炎亞共榮圈」理念的可能性。這種見解支配日本時，中國才會支持日本並且從新認真考慮「東亞共熒圈」問題。這個時候淤生俱的中日提携，而日木人應該覺悟要打倒英美，這樣中日間革命的提携是最確實的方法。因爲中國民族主義的成功預定印度自主獨立的成功。印度得從英國解放，直接影嚮英帝國的沒落。英帝國的沒落是全歐洲從英美炎本主義得解放的日子。美陽資本主義已經發達到沒有世界市塲則不能存在的程度，所以若是失去歐洲市塲及亞洲市塲，它也不能不隨之沒落。我確信這就是留給日本的最確實的「必勝」之途徑。（完）（昭銘譯）</p>
<h3>阿特里抵波次坦　三頭會議重開　英新外相貝文亦出席</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據波次坦昨夜發出官方消息宣稱：於貢車新首相阿特里等一行抵達波次坦後，三頭會議已正式復始。聞英新外相貝文亦隨同出席。</p>
<h3>日駐蘇公使　守島返任</h3>
<p>莫斯科二十九日中央社電日本駐莫斯科公使守島，於二十五日返扺莫斯科。</p>
<h3>瑞士允代管日在外權益</h3>
<p>蘇黎士二十九日中央社電　據伯爾尼電:西班牙於對日絕交之四月十二日，曾拒絕爲日本之利益代表國，於是日木電請瑞士政用爲日本利益代表國。瑞士政府業於二十六日正式通告日本政府謂，「本國願代表在美國中南美土耳其及西班牙之日本利益」。</p>
<h3>戈林患心痛症</h3>
<p>瑪德里二十九日中央社電　據路透社訊：前德馴空軍總司令戈林上將，現以」戰時羿犯」被禁於漢堡門道夫地區之聯合國集中營內。據稱，渠今忽患心痛症，故不能出席「戰時罪犯審訊法庭」。</p>
<h3>徐州募款賑濟水災</h3>
<p>徐州二十九日中央社電　日前本市黃河河水泛溢，致將兩岸民房冲坍，一時情勢至爲緊張，茲已平復。當局爲救濟受災難民，決定組織災民臨時救濟委員會’分調查募賬兩組，積極進行勸募賬款，迄已達四百餘萬元。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>堅持嚴正的立場</h3>
<p>以三頭會詠爲中心，英美方面最近不斷地策動對東亞約和平攻勢，至日前發表所謂特藝曼邱吉兩蔣介石共同宣言，而達於登峯造極的地步。</p>
<p>英美渝方最近策動這種和平攻勢，不是毫無原因的。主要的是：　歐洲戰爭結束以後，英美各鼴內部戰爭情緒大爲降落？美國忙於處理戰後失業問題，對於遠東的繼續作戰，頗表焦躁不安，希望早日結束戰爭；英國的情形亦復如是，但看這次總選保守黨之慘敗，便可看到英國人民厭戰情緒如何高漲。　　東亞戰局則相反的有延長之勢，但栽冲繩戰局之持久及美方損失之重大，便可想見，英美如何能在數千里外持久進行這種無名之戰，對於他們宜傳的聯合釅之建設及保障所謂和平安全，實爲自行矛盾，所以有早謀結束之意。　中國內部渝共街突，愈演愈烈，重慶表面雖尙侈言總反攻，實際已渴盼對日成立和平，以便全力對付中共，此點在美國亦暗中支持之，因爲英國在戰後爲挽救國內經濟危機計，非在中國保持絕對優勢之投資及推銷市塲不可，並須在中國獲得各種原料物資，凡此在共產黨勢力活躍之下是有阻力的。因此結東東亞戰爭，實爲液底肅淸中共的前提條件。</p>
<p>然而，英美渝三者對於結束東亞戰爭的方法和方式是非常錯誤的，他們還妄自尊大不顧事實，提出了所謂「無條件投隆」，外電所傳共同宣言的八項內容，竟是對德條件的變相。這極宣言，旣不顧日本在東亞之地位及共今日在太平洋全域軍事實力，更違反日本從事大東亞戰爭之正義目的，其不値得日本常局的一顧而置諸不理，可說是必然的結果。而尤可注目者，雖經英美渝多方活動挑撥，蘇聯仍堅持其遵守日蘇中立條約的立塲，在三頭會議中仍拒絕列各這次對日共同宜言，其前途尙可注目。</p>
<p>就我國而言，陳代主席於二十八日下午對日本記者團發表的談話，表示戰局無論如何推移，國民政府之決意毫不動搖，這種嚴正的立塲，是我們與日本爲同盟國者所應有的立塲，不僅我們中國應該堅持這種嚴正的立塲，而且一切東亞各國，爲着反對帝國主義統治在東亞各地復活，爲着完成東亞人之東亞的鑰史使命，我們更希望全東亞民族，一致堅持陳代主席所宣示的嚴正立塲，與盟邦密切協力到底，貫澈大東亞戰爭之月的。</p>
<p>但是，這種嚴正立塲之堅持，必須不僅是共同的信念與決意，而且應該是積極的實踐。當英美這種和平攻勢失敗以後，勢必集中其實力，以圖一逞，因此今後東亞戰局之演進，必更慘烈十百倍於過去，特別是在我國沿海各地，美軍之登陸侵攻，尤有不可避免之勢，其對沿海各大城市尤其益對上海的轟炸，亦必將大規模展開·我們對此尤應有充分的準備，加强我們官民一體的防衛態勢，以切實協力盟邦，同時，凡無居留上海及其他大城市必要者，特別是慈善團體敎育學術文化機關，允宜早日疏散。時危勢迫，幸勿再事幻想與觀望！</p>
<h3>美陸長史汀生　被議員彈劾</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九以中央社電　特魯曼於波次坦會談後，或將實施第二次改組內閣工作，其對像傳係陸長史汀生。據華成頓鴛構，美民主黨議員朗余，二十四日於衆院曾執拗要求即時罷免史汀生及陸軍次長巴德森，謂史汀生與巴德森對美陸軍兵十灌輸其「共產哲學」之思想。衆院之美國活動調查委員曾垠近頻接一般陸軍兵士投書抗議，俞稱陸軍中有共產主義思想之兵士，企岡赤化軍隊。</p>
<h3>英與美蘇　保持緊密聯擊　阿特里闡明基本政策</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據英京發出消息：英國新任首相與特里於離開偷敎赴波次坦之前，曾與國會內各要員舉行一不公開之會談。在舉行會談時，阿特里首相闡明工黨之一貫基本政策，即爲與美蘇兩國保持緊密之迎繫，且工黨已決意使新選舉之國會，得履行上項政策。娛路透社政冶記者談稱，阿特里首相會於此次會談時，聲明有意使一般英靑年踏入渠之新政府</p>
<h3>保守黨竸選慘敗之原因</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據此間接獲消息：英下院領袖參議院主席莫立遜夜倫敦發表談話，略謂，此次英國總選舉中，保守黨之失敗乃咎由自取，同時復以邱吉爾爲該黨之領袖，其失敗更爲必然之事。歷史將紀錄在一九四五年英國總選舉中，保守黨巡遜一瓦解之失敗，此項失敗正反射出全英投票者有明確之判斷力。同時歷史將記載邱吉爾曾對其國家確有明顯之功黝，而卒遭選舉之失敗，歷來英國保守黨常顯永出過分之聰明，彼等均意爲選舉不一定依據大衆之意見，而實際上大衆之意見，確能決定選舉之勝敗。保守黨認爲在一九四五年英國有思想之人數，不會超過在一九三五年及一九一八年，然事實證明一般中等階級，已早將彼等之政治觀念轉移至一毅然決然之政策上。</p>
<h3>世界職工會議　九月在巴黎召集</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社巴黎電：將於九月中在巴黎舉行之世界職工會於之秘書長頃發表稱，業已接獲艷達全數前曾參加在倫敦召開之世界職工會議之國家，　通知問意參加，然尙不知者，即拉丁美洲各國究將以何種形式出席。拉丁美洲工聯會主席托勒達諾曾通知謂，拉丁炎洲各職工會決將參加巴黎會議，但所不明者，即究竟各國將派遣一代表國，抑或各國職工會將分別派遺代表，因該項問題與各參加者所須付繳之會費極有關係。愛爾蘭職工會并無基金，故該秘書長正考慮可否於革幾種情形之下，減少所繳付之會費。雜時幷接獲要求允許參加會議之新請求，如澳大利亞職工會誘望參加此會議，及比利時之剛果職工會要求以獨立組織之地位，被邀參加會議。</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3>運河岸上之高郵</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者在揚州逗留三日後，當於月之五日起程前往高郵考察。是日午時在福運門外內河公司之輪船碼頭，搭乘小汽船，沿運河逆流而上。</p>
<p>運河現狀</p>
<p>這世界馳名的「大運河」，過去有着一段浪漫的傳說，在今日已成爲我國中部交通的大動脈。記者今番所經及看到的運河，是裏運之一段，亦即蘇北綏靖公署所轄地區運河的全部。即係由江都之瓜洲起至實應之黃浦止之一段，全長計一三五公里。按此段運河之航運，友其對農田灌溉上之價値，實屬全運之冠，但以過去之事實言，此段運河亦最易氾濫成災，而以河身之修守治理工程諭，全運河亦以此段爲最難。此乃地勢使然，蓋本段裏運西接高·寶·詣湖，東隣裏下河諸縣，爲准沂泗沫諸河入江之尾端，每値秋汎，河湖飲漲之際，而運西之水面，往往超出運東地面，竟達兩丈有餘，故屆時設一旦宣洩不及，巨災立成，以是當前運河隱患，實不容醫人忽視，藥其危險稈度，更以今日爲芸。蓋目前戰時環境特殊，國庫不裕，運河疏溶及護堤工作，久已停頓，記者今番所見之兩岸河堤、已見參差不齊，殆已成千孔頁雜之狀矣。</p>
<p>沿途一瞥</p>
<p>船行一時許，抵全錢之第一大站「　頭鎭」，時有旅客上下，故停泊片刻，旋即繼續鼓輸前進。前此河身寬僅二三十丈，但過此已雜運河連接邵伯湖湖口處，故河身驟闊，且支流縱錯，注洋一片，緣草養生，頗爲壯觀。經兩時又半，至邵伯瑛。鎭上河堤泰半營以巨右砌成，至爲整齊堅固。按邵伯距揚州四十餘里，市容頗盛，沿岸多傳運公司及土產竹籲竹簍行家，鎮東建有巨大之船閘，名「部伯船閘」。記者到達之日，以永漢故，船閘未啓，當時汽船須繞道西北而行。過邵伯鎮，河身復狹，沿途所見之洶垠頗高，垠下引有斜坡，寬約丈許，時河中載重帆船由船夫三五，拖　行經其上。最引記者懷疑者，即全程岸上有「河堤公路」平行，但絕未見一汽車行駛其上，而河堤上則又少見樹木，按常理樹可固堤，對預防永患價値炎大，殊令人費解。</p>
<p>七時一刻船抵高郵北門外碼頭，乃捨舟登陸，　京進城，投宿于高陞旅館。</p>
<p>市容與交通</p>
<p>高郵市容頗爲繁盛，街道較諸號稱蘇北有縣的江都反爲完整。據當地人吿，廿九年時駐高郵盟邦警備司令林田大佐，對郵城之路政提倡不遣餘力，適該時期之百治會長王仲宜氏（後任縣長）又係建設人才，經二氏統盤籌劃之下，將舊有街道放寬，如北門內之彩衣街與平和路以及城外之北門口及北市口等馬路，此外環城馬路亦係常時開闢者，據聞彼時民衆對路政之刷新，以須佔用民地，頗多煩言，至今日而始知此舉對高郵市容之整頓及商業交通上之貢獻也。</p>
<p>高郵對外交通，目前除沿運河可通鎮江實應外，兼有運堤公路本可直通淮海之徐州。奈月前以環境關係，僅達靑浦。</p>
<p>治安情況</p>
<p>高郵全縣計分八儼。城區有大鎭，即南益鎮·嘉和鎭（南門城內）·和平鎮（北門城內）·東山鎭。禹王鎮·珠湖鎮（北門外）。高郵過去原爲一等縣，茲以環境惡劣，縣政不能順利推進，致轄地日縮，由本年度起暫改爲二等縣。</p>
<p>以縣府經費困難，兼因軍差頻繁，據縣府負責人告，一切縣政上應辦事項，因雜營不能照預期步驟推進。各種統計調查工作，迄未着手，據當地警察局中人員告，城區人口約計五萬云。</p>
<p>治安情況城區較鴛穩定，其他各偃除八區（湖西）完全爲匪區外，其餘各區亦祗能局部推進。前此本縣縣長郭世茂欲雜定八區縣政，曾委派王世琳爲區長，隨軍前往，以廣沛鄉閔橋鎮爲根據地，原擬逐漸推進，但終以環境不許，爲時一月，王氏卒於五月下旬廢然而返，足說當地匪患嚴重之一班。</p>
<p>目下當地縣城中除盟邦譽備隊外，驗有四月中甫由阜寗換防至此之第二方義軍所屬之××師。記者抵達之日，於制勝門城頭（北門）目睹鄉民鄉婦多人正在堵修城眾，頗爲忙碌。同時街頭壁際上有孫主任施政三大網領巨大之標語，即　軍事第一，治安第一；　政治爲重，民生爲重；　官民合作，文武合作。誠以目前離城十里外，即有匪踪，故高郵之治安，孫氏極爲注意。</p>
<p>民衆擔負</p>
<p>事變前高郵有農田二百零九萬九千七百六十九畝三分八　，產雜糧之田畝約佔全體總數百分之二十，饊爲稻田（一季稻）及「草田」（沿遝河旁之田畝）。至高郵雜糧及米之出產量，及當地之消耗量與外運情況等，約如後表：名稱　出產量</p>

<p>田賦畝數，目下能微者僅二十七萬七千九百十九歟零六分，其賦率計每畝微米三升，縣右於客歲十二月一日開微，迄本年六月止，合計徵得一百三十二萬斤。</p>
<p>縣府之田　徽收概況，已如上述，此外供懸驗軍，每月需米兩千四五百担，（過去係由地方政府與人民共同檐負，茲已由蘇北綏靖公署負責統籌辦理）。</p>
<p>於民衆之擔負，以城區之居民論，每月須一萬萬元。四鄉農民之擔負頗有鬱差，大致離城區較近者，除田賦米三升外，其額外之派款·派米，總計每畝約年須三斗左右，遠者則五六斗不等。此項駐軍之派款·派米手續，有時由縣府承辦，有時則由駐軍約同鄉保長辦理。又隣近遊擊區之農民，則尙娛被徵每畝麥三十斤，及稻穀每畝二十餘斤。</p>
<p>民食嚴重</p>
<p>高郵向來產米至豐，民食原可無處，但最近經常地有力實行有組織之大規模走私後，存糧日缺，據縣府主管科中人吿，現高郵城區僅存銀糧兩千餘檐，設非親臨其地，言來實難令人置信。</p>
<p>米價四月間最上等米僅四萬元，旋因大批走私關係，剌激米價，扶搖直上，最勁時日漲十餘萬，最高峯曾達四十六萬，麥爲十二萬一擔。以米價之高漲，當地居民無力購米，早已以雜糧充覦。但所慮者，在此靑黃不接之際，常地現又蝗蟲爲患，田中之麥」被食百分之五十以上，而稻秧亦遭波及。記者留逗郵城之時（五日至八日），適値飛蝗過境，城區及東鄉南鄉一帶，與夫遠處之車遊鎮及三四諸區之稻田，皆受嚴重損害，故秋收後此間民食問題，至堪憂慮。</p>
<p>物價一般</p>
<p>高郵之物價亦逐步飛漲中，茲將七月八日當地主要物品之價格，分述如下，以供參考。</p>
<p>米最上等者每擔四十魚萬元，重一百九十五斤。麥每擔十一萬元。猪肉三千六百元一斤。洋燭每箱二十五萬元。日光皂每運六千五百元，固本每連七千五百元，陰丹士林布每尺九千業，常貨布（即常州出品）每尺七千元。</p>
<p>敎育概况</p>
<p>當地敎育頗爲發達，城區計有完全小學四所，即　中心，　城南，　城北，　新巷口諸校。初級小學則有城中小學一所。該校二十七年時被燬，現校舍係新建者。</p>
<p>中學祗有縣立中學一所，校舍頗爲宏大，亦係新造者，至敎員之待遇中小學敎員一律有公家配米三斗。四月前本有學生「獻米」，計每名每學期一斗，茲已取銷。最近小學敎員之月薪尙僅七百元，中學敎員則論鐘點，三十三年度計每小時兩元五角，月支底薪三八○元，故中學敎員每月支薪約一一四○元。目前以三十四年度之新預算省府尙朱核准，故高郵一般教育界人士，仍過着極度淸苦的　生活。</p>

<h3>上週金融工商市况　變動依然劇烈　烚赤股票暴漲驟跌</h3>
<p>本市金融與工商各業市况，於耀近一週，變動依然劇烈，烚赤毅票暴漲驟跌，爲一般業中人所難料，因受國際無　流言之衝動，投機市儈，利用時機，翻雲覆雨，曚忽人心，從中取巧作弄，企圖在紊亂中撈獲暴利，所以無識散戶，受共害者，不知凡幾。</p>
<p>金證券</p>
<p>金證券一週中，有三百萬元之高低，起伏雖烈，但結果較前選六收市反漲爲跌。週一承前週六之看高走勢，開盤即吿漲停板，爲一千○二十四萬元，每兩突漲一百二十四萬元，持券者堅持不肯脫手，形成有求無供之勢。週二續見暴挺，到期金證券續升一百五十四萬元，爲一千一百七十八萬一兩，有行無市。週三有某種空氣銀根趨　，突轉變劇跌，下午雖重熾漲風，但結果收市比上日仍圓跌一百○八萬元。週四因消息不利，多頭續見下挫，烚赤黑市亦步趨跌落，人心益不振，金券突退入千禺元大關，收市爲九百七十萬兄，成交額比上日增多十兩。過五週六以某種空氣及第五期金證券有確定發行日期，改災掛牌，由市塲出售，開盤呌價，有低於到期金券百分之二十以上之說，加以銀根續緊，故人心益軟弱，價漲後步退至九百萬元大關，爲八百四十二萬元收市。紋銀穩定於五萬元一兩。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>華股在一週中上關週係隨金價而告猛漲，下半週漲跌有離金價之　變彼漲我跌之勢。週一隨金券高續有五十餘種漲停板，雖有空襲之情事，仍難殺倒漲風。週三突受銀根緊迫，多頭逢高出籠，市呈反動圓落，惟有一部份脚地緊橋中型股升至限度。週四因金證券圓落，一部份市懀脫售金證券，而將資金轉移股市，吸收股票，銀根又復報鬆，是以上午股市先跌後漲，下午繼續挺升，成交再呈頻繁，多頭與散戶，均狂事哄抬。週五脫金求股者益衆，再見雜漲，各股莫不步步上升。週六復因五期金證券定期發行及票據交換變更關係，股市資金勢必影響狹小，故賣風突起，反動慘跌，至於最近一週工商各業方面，變動尙少。</p>
<p>米糧雜糧</p>
<p>米糧雜糧，因來源不斷。市嬰桓穩定。市災存底食米頗稱充裕，一般升斗平民，多已改食雜糧，嚴以最近米糧去銷頗爲呆滯，市價難見起色。惟日用品之油糖·肥皂·洋燭·火柴·燃料·柴炭·煤等市價，繼續高漲，各公司商號門售物價，亦頻漲不已，且標價頗不一致，有高有低。此種情形若右關經濟當局不加糾正，市民損害誠越匪鮮。</p>

<p>每天五千萬尤完成目標</p>
<p>本騵讀者助學金勸募運動，於本月五日開始，月標定爲十三萬萬元，以一月爲期。到今天焰止，日子已過去六分之五，而所得的損款僅六千八百以萬元，尙不足二萬三千餘萬元之鉅，運樣的成績真不免使我們爲三千五百多受助的學生擔心。但腰屆的事實告訴我們，在每次勸募運動行將結束的時候，我們都看見如火如茶，爭先恐後的捐款情形，從沒有一次失敗過，並且在結束後衍源漁不絕的捐輸。所以太屆我們也深信在澦鎰後的五天中，一定有衆多然心的讀者，以鉅顏捐款送來。</p>
<p>在我們的讀者中，不乏富有胤助心和間情心的人士的，這一點，不僅在歷屆助學金勸墓運動中表現出來，且在上次餘姚路火災捐款和正在進行中的空襲戰濟命損款中，都可以證明。尤其是這次空製救濟捐款，僅僅在不到十天的極短時期之內，我們就收到將近三萬萬元的純自動的捐款，運完全說明了我們的讀者是有偉大的同情心和互一助力的。</p>
<p>我們賢明而傳織的讀者是不會因爲目光集中衣空襲救濟，而忽略助越運動，甚至忘却三千五百的學子，即將失學約嚴實的危機的。</p>
<p>我們深信本報熱心的多數續者，在這鸚後的五天中必能打破我們每天收一千萬元捐款的預計，而以每天五千萬元的捐款，來迅速和順利地完成本屆助學金勸募的艱鉅而光榮的任務。</p>

<h3>整頓空襲臨時避難所</h3>
<p>— 謝</p>
<p>本埠近來空襲頻仍，民衆死傷頗衆，悽慘情况，觸日驚心。究其遭難原因，除直接受炸外，因蔔式民房震倒以致死傷者亦復不少。此種舊式災房，市內随處皆有，屋內民衆倘遇空製，若不躲避安全處所，輒有屋坍人死之處。雖日躱選空製，市中各處已開掘有防空壕，無如開掘太淺，上無掩蔽，建築不異，不切實用。目前改造原料勗貴，又非社會資力所可及。查本市各巨大商號住宅暨公共學校寺觀房崖，前曾由聯保處標貼空製臨時避雞所字樣，以備民案臨時躲避之需，確可減少民衆中彈或壓斃之危險，不意此種標貼，目前大都湮沒，若干屋主則以不願不相識者混入，甚至擅自扯除，故一遇空襲，市街來往民衆以及陋驗之居民，大都莫知所措，徬徨路隅，難免不遭敵機之機槍掃射，如此妨碍防空事務之進行，增加無謂犧牲，似應從速予以改藝。望右關當局會同聯保，就全市公共寺觀學校暨商店住戶有堅固靨屋者，迅即重行遍釘木牌標識，作爲戰時空襲臨時民衆避難所之用，以期本市重遇空製時，徉以減少死傷。</p>
<h3>空襲救護問題</h3>
<p>— 錢錚</p>
<p>本月十七日　東區慘遭轟炸，死傷取　，考其原因，　如當局所云，以參數應民，未　迅速避難所致，　救獲者出動　　，急　的手術設備不完備，以及醫院的玩忽職務，而吿不治者亦復不少。以下是　者目擎的實事：有友母作客於滬東親戚家，十七日不幸中騵片受傷，親戚亦於斯時分飲，事後遍防各醫院，杳無着落。後接電飴，悉在六萬路某醫院，筆者亦同彼等　車探　，見友母呻吟呼痛，惟神智尙淸，謂「傷憂等待許久，始經卡車載送醫義，入院時詢余親屬住址電話，因一時神智不淸，朱能回答，即與吾稍事消毒包紥後，　價一旁，呼　亦無人理問。反之旁楊同　者電知家屬後，即與其洗梳　際汚血，抑到之至。後憶得電話號碼，即央吿彼等電知爾等速來。」後詢問醫訓，據謂「創口右腰際，入院援即　去彈片砂泥，消毒一過，但有無殘留體內，則因設備不全，無X光，又無專門醫師，故無法測知」云。吾友相商之下，乃改送廣慈醫院，極診治，已因時間相隔過久，不能再動手術，祗得坐硯其死。筆者目擊心傷，用敢　請社會有識人士，設法辦到下列各點：　空紮後動員卡車，急駛出事地點，裝載受傷者。　請衛生當局從速調查翳院，右急救外科專門醫師及設備者，令其爲難胞服務，並於報端公佈院址，傳出事後救護班有所運與。　即使無專門醫師及設備之醫院，亦應一本固有鴦德，施行消毒急救後，代竟遜當醫院，以免因循坐誤。崁後希望有錢的踴躍捐助，有力的出力，以盡人類互助的義務</p>
<h3>防空壕之我見</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>當局爲了保障市與的安全，三令五由地策動了防空壕的建設，於是，防空壕在全市大街小巷星羅棋布了；不過，這些防空壕掘得異常簡陋，有蓋的不久已坍倒了，那無蓋的呢！無論是容納多人的或人的，不是汚泥塞沒，　穢充盈，即是積水成池，蚊蚋飛舞，臭氣薰蒸，行人掩鼻，無異田間陌上的糞坑，完全失掉防空的效用。本年入夏以來，似乎蚊蟲比往年爲多，疫癘也許會比較猖厥。大多數市民因營養不足，抵抗力本藝薄弱，倘再有病菌的嬰擊，那眞苦透了。</p>
<p>在遺種非常時期，安全第一，所謂市容交涌等問遠當然談不到，雖然弄得千瘡百孔，陷阱密怖，在燈光管制之下，行人隨時有跌入的可能，那只怪自不小心，沒有什麼可說的。筆者意思，上海灘本來是浸至水裏的，在這種地形上，挖提防空壕，委實是雞於討好的一件事，旣經認爲非想不可，那麼必須要做馴名副其實，好其隨便掘出這許多藏垢納汚，無益右害之防空壕。到不如歸　起來，築建幾十處或艷百　合予標準，確有實用的防空壕爲是。縱然就本市人。上說，絕對不敷慇用，但比起那有業無，實若虛，像目下所有的防空壕，總可以安安心吧，一得之見，不鑰足供賢明當局和民衆領袖俯賜鑒核否？（移酬幼學）</p>
<h3>如何防止傾跌防空壕羅漢</h3>
<p>上海市街防空壕之多，眞有五步一壕，十步一孔之概，工程完竣的固多，而未完工的亦復不少，任令汚水盈積，蚊蠅麋集馴臭氣受日光的曝晒而傳佈到空氣中，行人莫不掩鼻而過，此園有陽衞生，但最足以妨害公衆安全者，是一般夜行人，傾跌入防空壕之多，數見不鮮。即筆者之男女同事們，有的因跌入罹重傷，而不能簽到服務，有矚職守。又抱創痛！有的雙膝紅腫，舉步維艱，勉強到職，時時隱痛，勢難安心工作，於人於己，兩受損失；如何防止路人傾跌防空壕？似懸急速實施，萬不容忽視，鄙見未完成的防空壕，宜樹立「當心危險」的紅燈頭牌，庶路人咸知所戒避，而不致誤跌壕中。橫遭旡妄之災，願我市政當局保甲主政者，亟起圖之。</p>
<h3>實施緊急疏散</h3>
<p>— 慕韞</p>
<p>本市的疏散委員會自成立以來，大約已有數月之久，雖然對於疏敬工作積極辦理，但是格於環境，如運輸工具的缺乏，經費的支絀，以及各被疏散團體的個別問題，本實上成效甚微。</p>
<p>在璿毯日期之下，本市的環境，却日趨嚴重。第一是願價高漲，糧食缺乏，第二是失業衆多，茲生不易。在食之者衆，生之者寡的情况之下。這燄畸形的日子，到底　够維特多少時期，雖然是不能預料、但是嚴置性儼在日日增加，這是許也不能否認的。</p>
<p>前幾日本市又　麼次轟炸，死傷甚衆，　不定將來再發生大規橫的　劇。司見茲散人口是件急不容緩的事了。自韻的當然應該早日疏散，强迫的也該早日執行，以減少消費。死傷及損害的程度。</p>
<p>目前環境因雞，也是事實。日前有幾個曰願疏散回箱的人從鄉間出來，說鄉間地方不靖，生活程度也未見比上海低多少，反之謀生較上海更爲不易。譬如在上海姨皮鞋，擺小攤。做娘姨甚至做乞丐至少也能維持個人生活，在鄉下却無法可想。所以前幾日報上說疏散聲中的上海印在反疏散中，人口日日在增加。這次轟炸以後，或許又有自戰疏散的人，恐怕平解了一四，又靜悄悄地曰們個的回來。</p>
<p>要防止反疏散，我們主襲在實行疏散以前，先要限制入口。若憂僅是疏散而不限制入口，則本市人民勢將由了一批，又復回來，或換了一批，結果等於沒有疏散。所以我們希單市政當局，在積極推進疏散工作外，實行左列四點印停止不必要者毅入戶口（出生除外）。</p>
<p>複查戶口。凡無正當職業者强迫的自費或資助還鄉。凡非本市市民，限期離境。</p>
<p>限制旅各，使外埠各商，不得長期逗留。</p>
<p>恢復四鄉治安、使義鄉人民能得安居。</p>
<h3>建議節省用電換取自來水</h3>
<p>— 漢度</p>
<p>近日歷鴉肆虐，無論用水飲水俱形增加，因此自來水以超越限度而受罰款者比比皆是，市民在此生活程度日漲夜大重壓之下，再加此意外之威脅，誠無唯類矣。</p>
<p>關於自來水問題，本報已數數論列，或則建養當局增加限度，或則勸喻市民節約，然於事實均未見大功效，茲有一建製於當局，不知可資採納否？查自來水與電燈原隸屬同一公司，目今時値仲夏，日畏夜短，市民對電燈之消耗可有可無，而於自來水則卹長夏炎炎，勢必增加需要，而苦於限度之有限，鄙意自來水與電燈既隸屬一處，則公司方面鑒於市民之需要，不妨公怖一兩全之辦法，以電燈每度合自來水幾度，而以每戶電燈　度　化爲自來水限度，則以用於鴛燈者用於自來水，於市民旣化無用爲有用，而於公司方面則將電燈生產力之費用移於生產自來水，開支幷未增加，而於收入，則電燈費仍電燈費，自來水費仍自來水費，幷未短少。如此兩利之事，只在公司紙公佈之勞耳，未見有鬱難辦之處，唯其間容有技術之困難，耶非所知矣。</p>
<h3>票據隔日交換之非議</h3>
<p>— 師豪</p>
<p>頃閱報載「銀錢兩業……票據張數頻增，交換手續益感困雜，以致每日交換差額及退票張數，亦隨之增多。……糾給亦因之而迭起，爲解決困難……商討隔日交換翼據之事……」據此加以分析，則知原因是要據增多，困難是交幼差額及退票增多，結果是糾紛迭起，而補救辦法是隔日交換。詳細思考一下，即可發現這補救法實在不大高明。</p>
<p>第一、當日交換和交換差額毫無關係，除非有一部份票據載出，但此係各銀行之管理機構與辦事能力關係。忙的銀行當然要而且能僱用較多行員。故如因此而隔日交換，實不合理已極，</p>
<p>第二，退票大多係週轉不需所致，如隔日交換則週轉更不靈，必定反增加退票數，所以糾紛也一定更迭起。</p>
<p>第三，如隔日交換實行後，則假定一日下午一吟收得之票據，因鑲行錢莊已打烊，只好二日存入，三日交換，四日始知是否退票，未退則四日下午方可提用。計一日至四日相差三天。不計拆息，已不便利之極，不啻抑低翼據利用離，於是商民更畏票據，而欲現鈔。一部商民必將更歧視票據，而拒受票據。因而簡接使貼現之風更猖獗。小市民不勝其苦矣。</p>
<p>第四，交換手續困難並不是非隔日交換不可。如果將交換時間延緩一二小時，各銀行再多添職員，或將空閒部分職員暫移滙劃藥據部，則更容易收當日賬而不致再有票據軋出，票據必須當日交換，法有明文規定，可知自有其法律上根據與需要。今有他法而不採取，必需改法定之當日爲隔日，不知理由何在。且目前票據之增多係暫時現象，一待中儲大量俱給現鈔，票據即將減少。</p>
<p>總之隔日交換必助長貼現惡風，使商民感覺不便，希望銀錢業及財政局體念民艱，重予考慮。</p>
<h3>强化支票的信用</h3>
<p>— 穆恭</p>
<p>支票制度之製設，原是爲避免現金雜轉麻煩，以一紙支票代之，既簡單，又淸楚·非常便利。此種制度是建立在有可靠信用的支票上，此項支票的價値須十足相藝其票面金額，而決無遭退要或蒙受損失的危險，是一域具有獨立性信用的證券。但在我鏽，支票全穎人之信用又持着，離開了人，支葉是沒有自身之價値，雖然有法律規定。試看近來市上由於現鈔籌碼不够，不得不以票據代替，但其範圍祗限於熟悉人士，始能通行無阻；在陌生人之間，依舊有着一條不信任的鴻溝，雖然有勉強收受銀幷出票之本票·亦必以抄錄居住證爲必要。所以票據夜我國，還脫不了「憑單」的性質。所以擴成演樣，實因以往支票用得太爛的綠故。</p>
<p>如何才能使支票信用强化？就是勿爛用支製。這可從二方面來說：</p>
<p>發票人方面·支票濫用往往是不　發票人所造成，其原因是沒有存款以支翼爲歡騙搪塞之工異；亦有因款未收到，而預付支藥到期不獲兌現的、上述二釉原因，前岩根本是無賴、後者雖同樣失衍、然尙正當。不遜爲了支票　用計，似乎二皆不可。這似乎須每一個發票　　單謠一已信譽應該如此。爲整個票據制度更應該如此才好。</p>
<p>銀行方面票據法規完，祇銀錢業可作爲支票付款人，所以在强化支票循用方案中，銀錢業亦是一個主點。我訊爲該業至少應注意到二點：（甲）郵重開立往來，如必須有銀行素識之人介紹，不然，亦可令其舉出二個以上商號，經銀行諮詢，經答覆確係品性良好，有正當職業的，始可發給支票簿，准予往來，決不可貪圖利益，濫拉客戶。如某一般銀行有憑居住證以極小數金額即可開立支票戶的，這種條件下，阿狗阿貓。誰都可支票簿人手一冊了。這種安票信用，當然難以置信了。（乙）對付退票應有嚴格制栽，如退票二次，即停止往來，收回支票簿。如有些銀行對退藥祇收取若干手續費，似乎太不重視支票信用了，或許造成工商業對本行支票　現，　　　小失大，未圯太犯不飲</p>
<p>我相信誰鄴把强化友　　用的責任放在肩頭，則支票沒有遭退絮的危險，又可避免現鈔移轉之累煩，票據的流通雜奄無問題的。由於流通而徑過多人的昔書，使票據信用吏能趨向强化，那就使支票變或有獨立性信用的證券，人人可享受它的便利。這不是奢望，或許我們會覺得現鈔太多了。</p>

        <h1>1945.07.30</h1>
<h3>Prime Minister Suzuki of Japan Meets with Reporters, Discusses Wartime Policy, Disregards the Three-Power Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki met with reporters at 3 p.m. today. The interview lasted for an hour. He answered various questions and revealed his firm belief in the government's policy for dealing with the decisive battle phase on the home front. The question-and-answer content is as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) There seems to be a desire among the people for the government to retaliate against enemy naval bombardments of the homeland and air raids by enemy mobile units. What is the Prime Minister's view of the war situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding this point, the various ministries have recently discussed it. From the perspective of encouraging the people's will to fight, the military has its own plans regarding this point and is currently conducting operations based on this view. Therefore, please wait for developments. This is what the Chief of the General Staff told me. I have responded that we can temporarily disregard the people's concerns and do our best to carry out the operations most conducive to combat. Personally, I hope that the people will have absolute trust in the military regardless of how the war situation develops. At the same time, the operations department has very strong confidence. Please be assured that there are no worries behind. I also deeply feel the great responsibility, so I am constantly thinking and striving for the best. I hope that all 100 million compatriots will do their best in their respective positions and be loyal to their duties.</p>
<p>(Question) What does the Prime Minister think of the Three-Power Joint Declaration?</p>
<p>(Answer) In my opinion, the Three-Power Joint Declaration is nothing more than a repetition of the Cairo Conference. The government does not recognize any value in it and will simply ignore it and strive to complete the war.</p>
<p>(Question) The food problem is becoming increasingly serious due to reduced rations. What is the Prime Minister's view?</p>
<p>(Answer) The government has been trying in various ways to solve the food problem. However, although the ration has been reduced by 10%, it is not because the war situation has become so tense that a 10% reduction must be implemented immediately, but rather as a precautionary measure. I hope that the people will fully assist the government's policies. The government will certainly redouble its efforts to make the people's efforts more effective.</p>
<p>(Question) At this critical juncture in the war, it seems important to strengthen the government's political power.</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the strengthening of political power, we have previously implemented a decisive battle system and promulgated strong emergency measures so that various policies can be quickly implemented. Secondly, we have delegated the authority of the central government to the local government-general offices and implemented policies based on the strength of the National Volunteer Corps. All of these are indications of the government's efforts to strengthen political power.</p>
<p>(Question) Issues such as currency inflation and rising living consciousness should be based on the establishment of morality. Therefore, securing the most basic necessities of life should be a prerequisite. What is the Prime Minister's view on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) The establishment of morality should be preceded by securing the basic necessities of life. The government, as mentioned earlier regarding the food problem, is making its best efforts to secure the minimum essential food supply for the people. We are hoping for a good harvest this autumn, and we plan to restore previous rations as much as possible after the new grain is harvested. Fortunately, everyone has a considerable stock of clothing, so we should be able to get through this winter safely. The government has also taken measures to prepare for the winter.</p>
<p>(Question) Enemy air raids are increasing day by day, and damage to factories is increasing. The people are undoubtedly worried about the production status of military supplies and aircraft. What is the Prime Minister's view?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding this point, because various parties are working diligently, underground factories have achieved more success than expected. I recently visited them and am confident that there is no need to worry. Some factories seem to have taken action later than others, for which I apologize. However, from now on, we expect to increase production considerably. I cannot tell you how much production capacity we have now. However, I can tell you that the current production capacity has already exceeded the degree of concern and imagination of the people. Thousands of aircraft are manufactured every month. Now, most of them are underground factories, and the workers are working safely, which improves manufacturing efficiency. Some people are worried about the air circulation in the underground factories, but after asking, I learned that there are no problems with nine-hour workdays. The female workers are also very lively and engaged in production, and their health is excellent, which greatly increases work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Recent Two Weeks of Air Combat Results: Japanese Forces Destroy 418 Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Enemy mobile units have been lurking in the waters near the homeland since July 10th, stubbornly provoking the Japanese air force at bases. The enemy's disregard for Japan is extremely anxious. A portion of the enemy's ships are conducting naval bombardment, and they are also attempting to destroy transportation facilities, etc., clearly showing an intent to conduct preliminary operations for the next phase of combat. In response, the Japanese forces are conducting courageous counterattacks in various locations with fighters and ground fire. From the 21st to the 25th, they shot down 150 enemy carrier-based aircraft and destroyed 28 ships. Since July 10th, they have shot down a total of 275 aircraft and destroyed 143 ships, for a total of 418 aircraft. The target of the Japanese air force's counterattacks has been mostly enemy carrier-based aircraft this week, so the number of B-29 aircraft shot down is relatively small.</p>
<h3>B-29 Aircraft Raid the Tokaido Region of Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 120 B-29 aircraft launched incendiary bomb attacks on Hirakata City, Fukushima Prefecture, and its surrounding areas starting at 8:30 p.m. on the 28th, causing fires. The Japanese people's air defense units actively suppressed the fires. In addition, approximately 60 B-29 aircraft invaded the vicinity of Wakayama City at around 1:00 p.m. on the 28th, and approximately 160 other aircraft invaded the Tokaido region and dropped bombs on some cities.</p>
<h3>B-32 Aircraft Begin Use by United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Department of the Army announced on the 28th that the U.S. Army Air Forces' new bomber, the B-32, has now begun to be used and is participating in the war against Japan under the command of General George Kenney's air force.</p>
<h3>National Strengthening of the National Volunteer Corps in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since its inception, the Japanese National Volunteer Corps has been active throughout the country, working hard on building fortifications, evacuation work, revitalizing war-torn areas, increasing food production, and cooperating in transportation. As the decisive battle phase is approaching, the Ministry of Home Affairs has formulated the "Implementation Guidelines for Encouraging the Morale of the National Volunteer Corps" yesterday to strengthen its activities, requesting the local general government offices and the National Volunteer Corps Headquarters (i.e., the local governors) to implement it.

<h3>Fierce Counterattacks by Japanese Forces North of Davao, Philippines; Fighting on the Right Bank of the Chindwin River, Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The war situation in various areas over the past week is as follows: 1. In the South Pacific, the battle line from Balikpapan to Samarinda is at a stalemate. After receiving Australian reinforcements, the enemy is constantly disrupting the Japanese front lines with artillery fire and bombing, and is attempting to continue advancing with a small force. However, the Japanese air force is also cooperating with ground combat, and is currently fighting the enemy fiercely. 2. In the Philippines, fighting is still ongoing in the area north of Davao. Because of the fierce Japanese counterattacks, the enemy has stopped its frontal offensive and is trying to find weaknesses in the Japanese forces. 3. In the East Indian Ocean, after the enemy shelled Phuket Island in Thailand on the 25th, a part of them began landing on landing craft at around 9:00 p.m. However, the Japanese forces intercepted them at sea, inflicting heavy damage and forcing them to retreat. The enemy force was a British fleet based on two cruisers. At around 3:00 p.m. on the 26th, part of the enemy landed again near the southern end of Phuket Island, but was again forced to retreat by the Japanese forces. At 9:00 p.m. that evening, Japanese special attack aircraft attacked enemy ships, sinking one large cruiser and damaging one aircraft carrier or large cruiser. However, enemy ships are still cruising in the nearby waters. 4. In Burma, enemy counterattacks near the Chindwin River are gradually increasing. The rainy season has begun in the area. However, the enemy is using fighters to cover the counterattacks of ground troops, but the Japanese forces are still able to maintain the stronghold on the right bank of the Chindwin River and are currently fighting.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Cooperates in Balikpapan Battle</h3>
<p>Southern Base, 29th (Central News Agency) - On the 26th and 27th, the Japanese Air Force cooperated in the ground battle of Balikpapan, attacking enemy positions and material accumulation points, and achieving significant results. On the 26th, at dawn, all the bombs were dropped on the enemy's material accumulation points, inflicting heavy damage. On the 27th, they braved the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire and attacked the rear of the enemy's positions. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 29th (Central News Agency) - Due to fierce counterattacks in Balikpapan, active operations are not possible. The enemy's first-line forces are only conducting preliminary battles and are currently building fortifications between 10 and 14 kilometers east of Samarinda. The Japanese forces have dispatched raiding parties day and night, causing great losses to the enemy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Attack Forces Crash into Enemy Ships off Phuket Island</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese special attack squadron, attacking the enemy mobile unit that came to attack Phuket Island, displayed fierce power, sinking one cruiser and damaging one large ship of the enemy's main force. The situation has been reported to the base. The Japanese special attack squadron had been accumulating strength and waiting for an opportunity to attack the enemy since the 24th. On the afternoon of the 26th, they suddenly launched an attack in bad weather. When one aircraft broke through, it was hit by enemy fire and did not succeed. However, the situation at this time did not allow for hesitation. In the evening, the special attack squadron departed from the base again. When they flew over the enemy fleet, the weather was still very bad, making the attack difficult. At 8:50 p.m., Petty Officers Takanaga and Yamamoto each piloted an aircraft and crashed into a cruiser and a large ship, respectively, achieving success. Afterwards, reconnaissance by Lieutenant Nakajima's aircraft confirmed that the large ship that had been damaged was likely an aircraft carrier, and it soon sank.</p>
<h3>U.S. Battleship "California" Damaged in Philippine Waters</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced the following on the 27th: The battleship "California" was heavily damaged by a Japanese special attack aircraft attack on January 9th in the Philippine waters and is currently undergoing repairs at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The casualties among its personnel were 45 killed, 110 wounded, and 3 missing.</p>
<h3>My Belief in Certain Victory (2)</h3>
<p>— Yoshiida Toyu</p>
<p>Q: You say that the level of capitalist development in China and Japan is not very different. However, Japan's commerce and industry are much more developed, and their level cannot be compared with China. Is it not for this reason that China is resisting the entry of Japanese capitalism into China?</p>
<p>A: Of course, simply speaking, there is a considerable difference in the level of capitalist development between China and Japan. However, we can see that compared with other capitalist countries, especially with Britain and the United States, the difference in the level of capitalist development between China and Japan is not very large. The relationship between the two is what is called "brothers in distress." No, China and Japan in this sense can be called "brother" countries. To better understand this fact, please see the following statistical table.</p>
<p>Comparison of Iron Ore Production Between Britain, the United States, and China/Japan (Essential for Modern Industry)</p>
<p>United States 73,028,000 tons</p>
<p>Britain 18,900,000 tons</p>
<p>Manchukuo 1,070,000 tons</p>
<p>China 250,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan (Mainland and Korea) 828,000 tons</p>
<p>Pig Iron Production</p>
<p>Britain and India 9,100,000 tons</p>
<p>United States 41,900,000 tons</p>
<p>Manchukuo 500,000 tons</p>
<p>China 500,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan and Korea 1,900,000 tons</p>
<p>Steel Production</p>
<p>United States 56,430,000 tons (1929)</p>
<p>Britain 9,840,000 tons (1935)</p>
<p>Japan 4,600,000 tons</p>
<p>China 200,000 tons</p>
<p>Coal Production</p>
<p>United States 552,000,000 tons</p>
<p>Britain 262,000,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan 40,000,000 tons</p>
<p>China 100,000,000 tons</p>
<p>(Among the above statistics, the Chinese figures are based on Kasarin's statistics, while the others are based on Atlier's statistics)</p>
<p>As for electricity, Japan has hydroelectric power, but China's electricity is basically non-existent. As for oil production, neither China nor Japan produces enough to mention.</p>
<p>Power and energy sources such as coal, oil, and electricity can replace human labor to do work. If the amount of work done is converted into the amount of work done by human labor, one can see how similar the situation is between Japan and China. According to Litte's research, when two pounds of coal are used effectively, they can equal one person's day of labor. Assuming that 3.5 barrels of oil equal one ton of coal, comparing the mechanical and power work done by each person in each country yields the following figures:</p>
<p>Americans: 36 people's worth of work per year</p>
<p>British: 24 people's worth of work per year</p>
<p>Germans: 15 people's worth of work per year</p>
<p>Japanese: 2.2 people's worth of work per year</p>
<p>Chinese: 1.2 people's worth of work per year</p>
<p>(Other countries omitted)</p>
<p>There are also very similar phenomena in the industries of China and Japan. That is, the light industries of both countries are more developed than other industries, and there are more small factories with very few workers or apprentices in the light industries, that is, the so-called "Manufacturers" that appeared in the early stages of capitalist development, than large factories. According to Japanese economist Takahashi Kichi, approximately 46% of the total number of industrial workers in Japan are employed in small factories - or rather, workshops - with no more than five workers. According to a 1924 survey, in modern industrial cities like Osaka, approximately 68% of the 19,000 factories, or 13,000, employ five or fewer workers. Although there are no clear statistics for China, according to Kasarin's survey, 85% of cotton yarn and 40% of raw silk are processed by hand looms, and more than 50% of domestic consumption of cotton textiles is accounted for by household labor. It is said that even in modern industrial cities like Shanghai, the number of "manufacturers" reaches twice the number of factories.</p>
<p>Japan and China are called the most advanced countries in Asia, but the level of industry is only so-so. The situation in India is even worse. I think that the reason why China and Japan should jointly consider the liberation of Asia and the economic co-prosperity of Asia lies in this. Some people in Japan often lose sight of the great goal of liberating Asia because Japan's industry is slightly more advanced than China's, and they are working to colonize China in the same way as Britain and the United States, which is regrettable. However, as mentioned above, Japan, China, and India all have similar economic characteristics, that is, many feudal ideas remain inside, and they are externally oppressed by British and American imperialism. The possibility of realizing the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" idea only exists if China and Japan start from how to deal with this state. When this view dominates Japan, China will support Japan and seriously consider the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" issue again. At this time, a close Sino-Japanese partnership will be formed, and the Japanese should realize that to defeat Britain and the United States, this revolutionary partnership between China and Japan is the most reliable method. Because the success of Chinese nationalism predetermines the success of Indian autonomy and independence. India's liberation from Britain directly affects the fall of the British Empire. The fall of the British Empire is the day when the whole of Europe is liberated from British and American capitalism. American capitalism has already developed to the point where it cannot exist without a world market, so if it loses the European market and the Asian market, it cannot but fall with it. I am convinced that this is the most reliable path to "certain victory" left for Japan. (The End) (Translated by Zhao Ming)</p>

<h3>Goering Suffers from Angina</h3>
<p>Madrid, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, former Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force, General Goering, is currently being held as a "war criminal" in the United Nations concentration camp in Mendauf, Hamburg. It is said that he suddenly suffered from angina and therefore could not attend the "War Crimes Tribunal."</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Raises Funds to Help Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Yellow River overflowed its banks a few days ago, causing houses on both banks to collapse, creating a very tense situation. It has now been restored. In order to relieve the disaster victims, the authorities decided to organize a temporary disaster relief committee with two groups, one for investigation and one for fundraising, to actively solicit donations. To date, more than four million yuan has been raised.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Uphold a Firm and Just Stance</h3>
<p>With the Three-Power Conference as the center, the British and American sides have recently been constantly planning a "peace offensive" against East Asia, culminating in the so-called Truman-Churchill-Chiang Kai-shek Joint Declaration issued a few days ago.</p>
<p>There are reasons behind the recent "peace offensive" launched by the British, American, and Chongqing sides. The main ones are: 1. After the end of the European War, the war sentiment within Britain and the United States has greatly decreased. The United States is busy dealing with post-war unemployment and is quite impatient with the continued war in the Far East, hoping to end the war as soon as possible. The situation in Britain is also the same. Just look at the Conservative Party's crushing defeat in the recent general election to see how high the British people's anti-war sentiment is. 2. The East Asian war situation, on the contrary, shows a tendency to prolong. Judging from the duration of the Battle of Okinawa and the heavy losses suffered by the American side, one can imagine how Britain and the United States can continue to wage this "nameless war" from thousands of miles away. It is self-contradictory to their propaganda of building a united nation and safeguarding so-called peace and security, so they intend to seek an early end. 3. The conflicts between the Chongqing and Communist sides within China are intensifying. Although Chongqing still boasts about the general counter-offensive on the surface, it is actually eager to establish peace with Japan in order to fully deal with the CCP. This point is also tacitly supported by the United States, because in order to save its domestic economic crisis after the war, Britain must maintain an absolute advantage in investment and sales markets in China, and must obtain various raw materials from China. All of this is hindered by the active strength of the Communist Party. Therefore, ending the East Asian war is actually a prerequisite for completely eliminating the CCP.</p>
<p>However, the British, American, and Chongqing sides are very wrong about the methods and means of ending the East Asian war. They are still arrogant, disregarding the facts, and proposing so-called "unconditional surrender." The eight points of the joint declaration transmitted by foreign wires are actually a disguised version of the conditions for Germany. This extremely unequal declaration disregards Japan's position in East Asia and its current military strength in the entire Pacific region, and violates Japan's just purpose of engaging in the Greater East Asia War. It is a natural result that it is not worthy of consideration by the Japanese authorities and is simply ignored. What is particularly noteworthy is that despite the various activities and provocations by the British, American, and Chongqing sides, the Soviet Union still insists on its position of abiding by the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact and refused to list this joint declaration against Japan at the Three-Power Conference. Its future can still be noted.</p>
<p>As far as our country is concerned, Chairman Chen Dai's statement to the Japanese press corps on the afternoon of the 28th stated that no matter how the war situation develops, the National Government's determination will not waver. This firm stance is the stance that we and Japan, as allies, should have. Not only should we in China uphold this firm stance, but also all East Asian countries. In order to oppose the revival of imperialist rule in East Asia and to fulfill the historical mission of East Asians in East Asia, we further hope that all East Asian peoples will uphold the firm stance declared by Chairman Chen Dai, cooperate closely with our allies to the end, and implement the war to achieve the goal of the Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>However, upholding this firm stance must not only be a common belief and determination, but also an active practice. After this "peace offensive" by Britain and the United States fails, they will inevitably concentrate their strength in an attempt to succeed. Therefore, the future development of the East Asian war situation will inevitably be a hundred times more tragic than in the past. In particular, the landing invasion of American troops in the coastal areas of our country is inevitable. The bombing of the major cities along the coast, especially Shanghai, will also be carried out on a large scale. We should make full preparations for this, strengthen our defense posture as one government and people, and earnestly cooperate with our allies. At the same time, those who do not need to reside in Shanghai and other major cities, especially charitable organizations, educational, academic, and cultural institutions, should evacuate as soon as possible. The situation is dangerous and urgent. Please do not fantasize or wait and see any longer!</p>
<h3>US Secretary of War Stimson Impeached by Congressmen</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – Truman, after the Potsdam Conference, may implement a second cabinet reshuffle, and Secretary of War Stimson is rumored to be the target. According to sources in Washington, Democratic Congressman Long Yu on the 24th stubbornly demanded in the House of Representatives for the immediate dismissal of Stimson and Under Secretary of War Patterson, claiming that Stimson and Patterson were instilling their "communist philosophy" into the US Army. The House Un-American Activities Committee has recently received frequent letters of protest from ordinary soldiers, claiming that there are soldiers with communist ideas in the army attempting to communize the military.</p>
<h3>Britain Maintains Close Ties with the US and Soviet Union – Attlee Clarifies Basic Policy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: Before leaving to attend the Potsdam Conference, the new British Prime Minister Attlee held a closed-door meeting with key members of Parliament. During the meeting, Prime Minister Attlee clarified the consistent basic policy of the Labor Party, which is to maintain close ties with the United States and the Soviet Union, and the Labor Party is determined to enable the newly elected Parliament to implement the aforementioned policy. Reuters' political reporter said that Prime Minister Attlee stated during the meeting that he intends to bring young British people into his new government.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Conservative Party's Disastrous Defeat in the Election</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to news received here: Leader of the British House of Commons and President of the Senate, Morrison, made a speech in London, stating that the Conservative Party's failure in the recent British general election was self-inflicted, and that Churchill's leadership of the party made the failure even more inevitable. History will record the Conservative Party's comprehensive and devastating defeat in the 1945 British general election, which reflects the clear judgment of voters across Britain. At the same time, history will record that Churchill made significant contributions to his country, but ultimately suffered electoral defeat. Historically, the British Conservative Party has often shown excessive cleverness, believing that elections do not necessarily depend on public opinion, but in reality, public opinion can indeed determine the outcome of elections. The Conservative Party believed that the number of people with ideas in Britain in 1945 would not exceed that in 1935 and 1918, but in fact, the general middle class had already shifted their political views to a resolute policy.</p>
<h3>World Federation of Trade Unions to Convene in Paris in September</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – According to TASS, Paris: The Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which will be held in Paris in mid-September, recently announced that he has received notifications from all countries that previously participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions conference held in London, expressing their intention to participate. However, it is still unknown in what form the Latin American countries will attend. The Chairman of the Latin American Federation of Labor, Toledano, has notified that the Latin American trade unions have decided to participate in the Paris conference, but it is unclear whether each country will send one representative or whether the trade unions of each country will send representatives separately, as this issue is closely related to the membership fees that each participant must pay. The Irish Trade Union Congress has no funds, so the Secretary-General is considering whether it is possible to reduce the membership fees paid under certain circumstances. At the same time, new requests for permission to participate in the conference have been received, such as the Australian Trade Union Congress's desire to participate in this conference, and the Congolese Trade Union of Belgium's request to be invited to participate in the conference as an independent organization.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Gaoyou on the Grand Canal</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>After staying in Yangzhou for three days, the reporter set off on the 5th of this month to inspect Gaoyou. On the same day, at noon, he boarded a small steamboat at the steamboat pier of the Inner River Company outside Fuyun Gate, and went upstream along the Grand Canal.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Grand Canal</p>
<p>This world-famous "Grand Canal", which once had a romantic legend, has now become a major artery of transportation in central China. The section of the canal that the reporter passed and saw this time is a section of the Li Canal, that is, the entire section of the canal in the area under the jurisdiction of the Subei Pacification Headquarters. It starts from Guazhou in Jiangdu and ends at Huangpu in Shiying, with a total length of 135 kilometers. According to the shipping of this section of the canal, its value for agricultural irrigation is the best in the entire canal, but in the past, this section of the canal was also the most prone to flooding, and the repair and management projects of the river itself were the most difficult in the entire canal. This is due to the terrain. This section of the Li Canal is connected to the Gao Bao Shaobo Lakes in the west and adjacent to the counties of the Lixia River in the east. It is the tail end of the Zhun Yi Si Mo and other rivers entering the Yangtze River. Every time it floods in autumn, when the river and lakes are full, the water level in the west of the canal often exceeds the ground level in the east of the canal by more than two zhang. Therefore, if the water cannot be discharged in time, a huge disaster will occur. Therefore, the current hidden dangers of the canal should not be ignored by anyone, and its degree of danger is even greater today. Currently, the wartime environment is special, the national treasury is not abundant, and the canal dredging and embankment protection work has been suspended for a long time. The river embankments on both sides seen by the reporter this time have already become uneven and almost riddled with holes.</p>
<p>A Glimpse Along the Way</p>
<p>After the boat traveled for an hour, it arrived at the first major station of Quanqian, "Shatou Town". Some passengers got on and off, so it docked for a while, and then continued to move forward. Before this, the river was only twenty or thirty zhang wide, but after passing this, it was connected to the mouth of Shaobo Lake, so the river suddenly widened, and the tributaries were crisscrossed, forming a vast expanse of water, with lush grass, which was quite spectacular. After another two and a half hours, it arrived at Shaobo Town. Most of the river embankment in the town is built with huge stones, which is very neat and solid. Shaobo is more than forty li away from Yangzhou, and the market is quite prosperous. There are many transportation companies and local bamboo basket dealers along the coast. A huge ship lock, named "Shaobo Ship Lock", is built in the east of the town. On the day the reporter arrived, the ship lock was not open due to maintenance, and the steamboat had to detour to the northwest. After passing Shaobo Town, the river narrowed again, and the embankments seen along the way were quite high. Under the embankments, there were slopes, about one zhang wide. From time to time, cargo sailing boats in the river were towed by three or five boatmen. What aroused the reporter's suspicion the most was that there was a "River Embankment Highway" parallel to the entire course, but no cars were seen driving on it, and there were few trees on the river embankment. According to common sense, trees can consolidate the embankment, and their value in preventing floods is very great, which is quite puzzling.</p>
<p>At 7:15, the ship arrived at the pier outside the North Gate of Gaoyou, and then disembarked and entered the city, lodging in the Gaosheng Hotel.</p>
<p>City Appearance and Transportation</p>
<p>The city of Gaoyou is quite prosperous, and the streets are more complete than Jiangdu, which is known as a county in northern Jiangsu. According to locals, Colonel Hayashida, the commander of the Allied Garrison in Gaoyou in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), spared no effort in promoting the road administration of Youcheng. At that time, Wang Zhongyi (later the county magistrate), the chairman of the Self-Government Association, was also a talent for construction. Under the overall planning of the two, the existing streets were widened, such as Caiyi Street and Heping Road inside the North Gate, as well as Beimenkou and Beishikou Roads outside the city. In addition, the ring road around the city was also opened at that time. It is said that the public at that time had many complaints about the renovation of the road administration, as it required the use of private land. Only today do they know the contribution of this measure to the rectification of Gaoyou's city appearance and commercial transportation.</p>
<p>Gaoyou's external transportation currently includes the Grand Canal, which can lead to Zhenjiang and Shiying, and the Canal Embankment Highway, which can directly lead to Xuzhou in Huaihai. However, due to environmental reasons, it only reaches Qingpu.</p>
<p>Public Security Situation</p>
<p>Gaoyou County is divided into eight districts. The urban area has large towns, namely Nan Yi Town, Jiahe Town (inside the South Gate), Heping Town (inside the North Gate), and Dongshan Town, Yuwang Town, and Zhuhu Town (outside the North Gate). Gaoyou used to be a first-class county, but due to the harsh environment and the inability to smoothly advance county administration, the jurisdiction has shrunk day by day, and it has been temporarily changed to a second-class county starting this year.</p>
<p>Due to the county government's financial difficulties and frequent military errands, according to the person in charge of the county government, everything that should be done in county administration cannot be promoted according to the expected steps. Various statistical surveys have not yet begun. According to personnel in the local police station, the population of the urban area is about 50,000.</p>
<p>The public security situation in the urban area is relatively stable. In addition to the eighth district (west of the lake), which is entirely a bandit area, the remaining districts can only be partially promoted. Previously, Guo Shimao, the magistrate of this county, wanted to stabilize the county administration of the eighth district, and appointed Wang Shilin as the district chief, who went with the army, taking Guangpei Township and Minqiao Town as the base, and originally planned to gradually advance. However, due to the unfavorable environment, Wang returned in frustration in late May, which is enough to show the severity of the banditry in the area.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to the Allied Garrison Team in the local county seat, there is also the ×× Division of the Second Righteous Army, which has just been transferred from Funing in mid-April. On the day the reporter arrived, he saw many villagers and women busy repairing the city walls on the head of the Zhisheng Gate (North Gate). At the same time, there were huge slogans on the walls of the streets with the three major guidelines for Sun's administration, namely: Military First, Public Security First; Politics is Important, People's Livelihood is Important; Government-People Cooperation, Civil-Military Cooperation. Since there are bandits within ten li of the city, Sun pays great attention to the public security of Gaoyou.</p>
<p>Public Burden</p>
<p>Before the Incident, Gaoyou had 2,099,769 mu, 3 fen, 8 li of farmland, of which fields producing miscellaneous grains accounted for about 20% of the total, and the rest were rice fields (one season of rice) and "grass fields" (fields along the Tag River). The output of miscellaneous grains and rice in Gaoyou, the local consumption, and the situation of external transportation are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Item | Output | Price per Dan | Local Consumption | Exportable Amount | Destination</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Wheat | 98,530 Dan | 116 | 50,000 Dan | 30,000 Dan | Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Wheat | 704,549 Dan | 149 | 300,000 Dan | 200,000 Dan | Nanjing</p>
<p>Naked Barley | 26,334 Dan | 145 | 12,000 Dan | 10,000 Dan | Nanjing</p>
<p>Soybeans | 45,000 Dan | 200 | 20,000 Dan | 15,000 Dan | Nanjing</p>
<p>Broad Beans | 6,973 Dan | 200 | - | 2,000 Dan | -</p>
<p>Peas | 4,153 Dan | 200 | 3,500 Dan | 1,000 Dan | Nanjing</p>
<p>Mung Beans | 4,000 Dan | 200 | 3,000 Dan | 1,000 Dan | Nanjing</p>
<p>Rice | 1,400 Dan | 142 | 1,200 Dan | 80 Dan | Nanjing Shanghai</p>
<p>The area of farmland currently subject to taxation is only 277,919 mu and 6 fen, and the tax rate is 3 sheng of rice per mu. The county started taxation on December 1 last year, and by June of this year, it had collected a total of 1,320,000 jin.</p>
<p>The county government's tax collection situation is as described above. In addition, the garrison army needs 2,450 dan of rice per month (which used to be borne jointly by the local government and the people, but is now the responsibility of the Subei Pacification Headquarters).</p>
<p>Regarding the burden on the people, for residents in the urban area, they need to pay 10,000,000 yuan per month. The burden on farmers in the countryside varies greatly. Generally, those closer to the urban area, in addition to the 3 sheng of rice per mu for land tax, the total amount of additional levies and rice is about 3 dou per mu per year. Those farther away pay 5 or 6 dou. The procedures for the levy of funds and rice by the garrison army are sometimes handled by the county government, and sometimes by the garrison army in conjunction with the township chiefs. In addition, farmers in the vicinity of the guerrilla area are still subject to a levy of 30 jin of wheat per mu and more than 20 jin of rice per mu.</p>
<p>Severe Food Shortage</p>
<p>Gaoyou has always produced abundant rice, and the people's food supply was originally not a problem. However, after large-scale organized smuggling has been carried out frequently, the stock of grain has been dwindling. According to people in the county government's competent department, there are currently only more than 2,000 dan of grain left in the urban area of Gaoyou, which is hard to believe unless you are there in person.</p>
<p>In April, the best quality rice was only 40,000 yuan per dan. Subsequently, due to large-scale smuggling, the rice price rose sharply, rising by more than 100,000 yuan per day at its peak, reaching a maximum of 460,000 yuan, and wheat was 120,000 yuan per dan. Due to the high rice prices, local residents cannot afford to buy rice and have long been using miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs. But what is worrying is that at this time of year, locusts are plaguing the area, and more than 50% of the wheat in the fields has been eaten, and rice seedlings have also been affected. When the reporter stayed in Youcheng (from the 5th to the 8th), he happened to be in the midst of a locust plague. The rice fields in the urban area, the eastern and southern townships, and the distant Cheyou Town and the third and fourth districts were all severely damaged. Therefore, the food problem here after the autumn harvest is very worrying.</p>
<p>General Prices</p>
<p>The prices of goods in Gaoyou are also rising gradually. The prices of the main items on July 8 are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>The best quality rice is 460,000 yuan per dan, weighing 195 jin. Wheat is 110,000 yuan per dan. Pork is 3,600 yuan per jin. Candles are 250,000 yuan per box. Sunlight soap is 6,500 yuan per bar. Solid glue is 7,500 yuan per piece. Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth is 9,000 yuan per foot. Ordinary cloth (i.e., produced in Changzhou) is 7,000 yuan per foot.</p>
<p>Education Overview</p>
<p>Local education is quite developed. There are four complete primary schools in the urban area, namely Central, Chengnan, Chengbei, and Xinxiangkou Schools. There is also Chengzhi Primary School, a junior primary school, in the urban area. The school was destroyed in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), and the current school building is newly built.</p>
<p>There is only one county-run middle school, and the school building is quite grand and also newly built. Regarding the treatment of teachers, primary and secondary school teachers all receive 3 dou of rice from the government. Before April, students "contributed rice", which was 1 dou per student per semester, but this has been abolished. Recently, the monthly salary of primary school teachers is only 700 yuan, while the salary of middle school teachers is based on clock hours. In the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), it was 2.5 yuan per hour, and the monthly base salary was 380 yuan, so the monthly salary of middle school teachers is about 1,140 yuan. Currently, the new budget for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) has not yet been approved by the provincial government, so the general education community in Gaoyou is still living a very poor life.</p>

<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week Remained Highly Volatile – Jin Zhengquan (Gold Certificates) Stocks Rose and Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in this city have remained highly volatile in the past week. Jin Zhengquan stocks rose and fell sharply, which was unexpected by most people in the industry. Due to the stimulation of international rumors, speculative merchants took advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the market and deceive people, attempting to reap huge profits in the chaos. Therefore, countless ignorant retail investors have suffered.</p>
<p>Gold Certificates</p>
<p>The high and low of gold certificates in a week was 3,000,000 yuan. Although the fluctuation was violent, the closing result was higher than the closing price of the previous week. On Monday, it continued the bullish trend of the previous Saturday, and the opening immediately announced a limit up, at 10,240,000 yuan, a sudden increase of 1,240,000 yuan per tael. Certificate holders insisted on not selling, forming a situation where there was demand but no supply. On Tuesday, it continued to rise sharply, and expiring gold certificates continued to rise by 1,540,000 yuan, at 11,780,000 yuan per tael, with no market for the price. On Wednesday, a certain atmosphere caused the money supply to tighten, and there was a sudden sharp drop. Although the bullish trend was re-ignited in the afternoon, the closing result was still a drop of 1,080,000 yuan compared to the previous day. On Thursday, due to unfavorable news, the bulls continued to decline, and the black market also followed the downward trend. People's hearts became even more depressed, and gold certificates suddenly fell below the 10 million yuan mark, with a closing price of 9,700,000 yuan, and the transaction volume increased by 10 taels compared to the previous day. On Friday and Saturday, due to a certain atmosphere and the fact that the fifth phase of gold certificates had a definite issue date, it was changed to public listing and sold on the market. The opening price was said to be more than 20% lower than the expiring gold certificates. In addition, the money supply continued to tighten, so people's hearts became more and more weak, and the price retreated to the 9,000,000 yuan mark, closing at 8,420,000 yuan. Silver was stable at 50,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks rose sharply in the upper half of the week following the price of gold, and in the lower half of the week, the rise and fall deviated from the price of gold. On Monday, more than 50 stocks continued to rise to the limit following the high price of gold certificates. Although there was an air raid, it was still difficult to suppress the bullish trend. On Wednesday, due to the sudden tightening of the money supply, the bulls came out to sell at high prices, and the market showed a reactionary decline. However, some firmly grounded mid-cap stocks rose to the limit. On Thursday, some market participants sold gold certificates and transferred funds to the stock market to absorb stocks, and the money supply rebounded. Therefore, the stock market rose first and then rose again in the morning, and continued to rise in the afternoon. The transaction volume was frequent again, and both bulls and retail investors were enthusiastically hyped up. On Friday, more and more people abandoned gold for stocks, and stocks rose across the board. On Saturday, due to the scheduled issuance of the fifth phase of gold certificates and changes in bill exchange, the stock market funds were bound to be affected and narrowed, so a selling wind suddenly arose, and there was a reactionary sharp decline. As for the industrial and commercial sectors in the past week, there were few changes.</p>
<p>Rice and Grains</p>
<p>The supply of rice and grains is constant. The market is relatively stable. The market has a sufficient supply of rice, and most ordinary people have switched to eating miscellaneous grains. Recently, rice and grain sales have been sluggish, and market prices have been difficult to rise. However, the market prices of daily necessities such as oil, sugar, soap, candles, matches, fuel, firewood, charcoal, and coal have continued to rise. The prices of goods sold in various companies and shops have also been rising frequently, and the prices are quite inconsistent, with some high and some low. If the economic authorities do not correct this situation, the harm to the citizens will be even greater.</p>
<h3>Last Five Days of Donations – Hoping Readers Will Donate Actively</h3>
<p>50 Million Yuan Per Day to Complete the Goal</p>
<p>The fundraising campaign for this newspaper's reader scholarship fund started on the 5th of this month, with a monthly target of 130 million yuan for one month. As of today, five-sixths of the time has passed, and the amount of donations received is only 68 million yuan, which is still a huge shortfall of more than 23 million yuan. Such a result cannot help but make us worry about the more than 3,500 students who are being assisted. However, past facts tell us that every time a fundraising campaign is about to end, we see a hot and competitive donation situation, and there has never been a failure, and there has been a continuous stream of donations after the end. Therefore, we also firmly believe that in the last five days, there will be many caring readers who will send in large donations.</p>
<p>Among our readers, there are many wealthy people with a heart for helping others and compassion. This point has not only been demonstrated in previous scholarship fundraising campaigns, but also in the previous Yuyuan Road fire donation and the ongoing air raid relief donations. Especially this time for the air raid relief donations, in just a very short period of less than ten days, we received nearly 300 million yuan of purely voluntary donations, which fully demonstrates that our readers have great sympathy and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Our wise and well-organized readers will not neglect the scholarship campaign due to the concentration of attention on air raid relief, or even forget the imminent crisis of nearly 3,500 students losing their schooling.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the majority of enthusiastic readers of this newspaper will be able to break our estimate of receiving 10 million yuan in donations per day in the next five days, and quickly and smoothly complete the difficult and glorious task of this scholarship fundraising with donations of 50 million yuan per day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Yu Chen celebrated his 50th birthday, and donated 100,000 yuan by saving on the banquet expenses. Also, Mr. Ke Qiyu and Mr. Luo Zhijia each donated 100,000 yuan. Sincere thanks are expressed.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Train Tickets Discovered at the North Station</h3>
<p>Following the recent bombing of this city, residents have been returning to their hometowns in droves. Some scalpers, seeing an opportunity, have become active again. The station manager of the North Station, Mei Yuan, fearing that the public will be deceived, made the following statement to reporters: "Recently, some unscrupulous elements have taken advantage of the increase in ticket prices and the surge in the number of people returning to their hometowns, and have dared to forge train tickets, secretly selling them in front of this station or other places. The railway authorities will not be responsible for any losses suffered by passengers. In the future, passengers should go directly to the East Asia Transportation Corporation or the ticket office of this station to</p>

<h3>Banks and Financial Institutions Suspended from Business Will Be Allowed to Resume Operations</h3>

<h3>This Office's Small Loan Report for May and June: The Use of Funds is Always Insufficient</h3>
<p>This office's small loan fund, in May and June, loaned to a total of fifty units, with a loan amount of 418,000 yuan. Currently, each person is required to borrow 20,000 yuan. The principal is repaid once a month, without interest, and paid off in ten installments. Therefore, even if each borrower can repay monthly, the principal will be fully recovered after ten months. Moreover, in the next ten months, the fund must continue to be loaned out. On the other hand, if prices rise, in order to help the needy, the loan amount has to be increased. Therefore, the circulating use of funds is always insufficient. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will generously donate to enrich the fund, which is an indirect social undertaking to assist the unemployed. The amount of loans in May and June is published as follows:</p>

<h3>Pushan Burial Society to Broadcast for Donations</h3>
<p>The Pushan Burial Society has been established for thirty-three years, with the main purpose of collecting and burying unclaimed coffins and abandoned corpses of children. The head office is located on Beihai Road (i.e., Liuma Road). Since its establishment, it has collected and buried 711,211 coffins of various sizes, and distributed 268,597 coffins of various sizes. Before the war, burial grounds were located in the Dachang area, and after the war, in Hongqiao in western Shanghai and Panlong Town in Qingpu. There has never been a fund, and all expenses rely on donations from enthusiastic people. Recently, the price of wood has skyrocketed. A thin-skinned coffin that cost three to five yuan before the war now costs 200,000 yuan. In this hot summer, there are many deaths, and the city is also frequently subjected to air raids, resulting in many casualties. More coffins are needed. It is planned to broadcast for donations in the near future, hoping that philanthropists will generously donate to support this charitable cause.</p>

<h3>Rectifying Temporary Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>This port has been frequently subjected to air raids recently, resulting in many civilian casualties, and the tragic situation is shocking every day. The reason for the disaster, in addition to direct bombing, is that many people were killed or injured due to the collapse of old-style civilian houses. These old-style disaster houses can be found everywhere in the city. If residents in the houses do not take shelter in a safe place during an air raid, they will die from the collapse of the house. Although people are avoiding air raids every day, air raid shelters have been dug everywhere in the city, but they are too shallow and have no shelter on top, making the construction different and impractical. At present, the cost of renovating raw materials is high, which is beyond the reach of social resources. The huge commercial houses, residences, public schools, and temple buildings in this city were previously labeled with the words "Temporary Air Raid Shelter" by the Lianbao Office, so that civilians could take temporary shelter during an air raid, which could indeed reduce the risk of civilians being hit by bullets or crushed to death. Unexpectedly, these labels have mostly disappeared, and some homeowners are unwilling to let strangers enter, and even remove them without authorization. Therefore, when an air raid occurs, the civilians traveling on the streets and the residents of the slums are at a loss and wander around the roadside, inevitably being shot by enemy planes. This hinders the progress of air defense affairs and increases unnecessary sacrifices. It seems that it should be rectified as soon as possible. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will work with Lianbao to quickly re-nail wooden signs to identify public temples, schools, shops, and residential houses with solid houses throughout the city, as temporary civilian shelters during wartime air raids, so as to reduce casualties when the city encounters air raids again.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Rescue Issues</h3>
<p>— Qian Zheng</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, the eastern district was tragically bombed, and the number of deaths and injuries , according to the authorities, the reason is , the number of people who should respond to the people is not , the rapid shelter led to , the rescuer came out , the surgical equipment of ,急 is incomplete, and the negligence of the hospital , and the announcement of death is also a lot.

The relatives also shared drinks at that time. Afterwards, the hospitals were searched all over, and there was no news. Later, a telegram was received, knowing that it was in a hospital on Liwan Road. The author also went with them by car to , see the friend's mother moaning in pain, but her consciousness was still clear, saying that "I have been waiting for a long time for the injury, and then I was transported by a truck to the doctor, and when I was admitted to the hospital, I asked for my relative's address and phone number, because I was temporarily unconscious, Zhu can answer, that is, I will disinfect and bandage it slightly, and then give a price, shout it aside, and no one will care. On the contrary, the fellow Yang, who also , informed his family by telephone, and washed and scrubbed the blood on his body, and suppressed it to the extreme. Later, I remembered the phone number, and asked them to call you to come quickly." After asking the medical record, it was said that "the wound is on the right waist, and when I was admitted to the hospital, I immediately , removed the shrapnel and mud, and disinfected it once, but whether there are any residues in the body, because the equipment is incomplete, there is no X-ray, and there is no specialist doctor, so there is no way to measure it." After discussing with my friends, I sent it to Guangci Hospital, and after a medical examination, because the time was too long, I could not have surgery again, so I had to sit and grind to death. The author was heartbroken to witness, so I dare , please the people of insight in the society, find a way to do the following points: After the air raid, mobilize trucks, rush to the scene of the accident, and load the injured. Please the health authorities to quickly investigate the hospital, and those who have specialist doctors and equipment in urgent surgery, order them to serve the refugees, and publish the hospital address in the newspaper, so that the rescue team will have something to transport. Even if there is no specialist doctor or equipment in the hospital, it should also be based on its inherent , and after implementing disinfection and first aid, it should be replaced by a hospital, so as to avoid following the wrong . It is hoped that the rich will enthusiastically donate, and the strong will contribute their efforts, so as to fulfill the obligations of human mutual aid.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of the city, the authorities have repeatedly promoted the construction of air raid shelters, so air raid shelters are scattered throughout the city's streets and alleys; however, these air raid shelters are dug very simple, and those with lids have collapsed soon, and those without lids! Whether it is to accommodate many people or people, it is either filled with sewage, or it is filled with filth, or it is full of water, mosquitoes are dancing, the stench is steaming, pedestrians cover their noses, it is no different from the dung pits in the fields, and the air defense effect is completely lost. Since the beginning of this summer, it seems that there are more mosquitoes and insects than in previous years, and the epidemic may be more rampant. Most citizens are weak due to lack of nutrition, and if they are attacked by bacteria again, it is really bitter.</p>
<p>In the very special period of , safety first, so-called city and traffic questions of course can not be discussed, although it has been made riddled with holes, and the traps are densely , under the control of lights, pedestrians may fall into it at any time, and that is just because of their own carelessness, and there is nothing to say. The author means that Shanghai Tan was originally soaked in water, and in this terrain, digging air raid shelters is really a chicken to please. Since it is considered that it must be thought of, then it must be done in a famous and true way, so it is better to dig out so many air raid shelters that hide dirt and accept dirt, which are useless to the right and harmful. It is better to return , to build dozens of or hundred , together , standard, and truly practical air raid shelters. Even if the local people , speaking, are absolutely not enough to use , but compared to that , it is nothing more than real, like the air raid shelters that are currently available, you can rest assured, a little bit of view, is not enough to be used by the wise authorities and public leaders to condescend to examine it?

<h3>How to Prevent Tipping Over the Air Raid Shelter Arhat</h3>
<p>There are so many air raid shelters in Shanghai streets that there is almost one every five steps and one hole every ten steps. There are many that have been completed, and there are also many that have not been completed. Letting the sewage accumulate, mosquitoes and flies gather, and the stench spreads into the air under the sun, pedestrians cannot help but cover their noses and pass by. This garden has yang hygiene, but what is most likely to harm public safety is the general night walkers. The number of people who tip over into the air raid shelters is not uncommon. That is, the author's male and female colleagues, some of them were seriously injured because of falling, and could not sign in for service, and there were those who held their positions. Also hold pain! Some of their knees are red and swollen, and it is difficult to walk, and they are forced to come to work, and they are always in pain. It is difficult to work with peace of mind. Both people and themselves suffer losses; How to prevent passers-by from tipping over into air raid shelters? It seems to be implemented quickly, and it is not allowed to be neglected. In my humble opinion, the air raid shelters that have not been completed should be erected with red light signs of "Beware of danger", so that passers-by will know what to avoid, and will not mistakenly fall into the trenches. Suffering from the disaster of delusion, I wish my municipal authorities to protect the main government, and I urge you to make a plan.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Emergency Evacuation</h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>The city's evacuation committee has been in existence for about several months since its establishment. Although it has been actively working on evacuation matters, due to environmental limitations such as the lack of transportation, financial constraints, and individual problems of various evacuated groups, the actual effectiveness has been minimal.</p>
<p>Under the threat of impending war, the city's environment is deteriorating day by day. Firstly, prices are soaring and there is a shortage of food. Secondly, there is widespread unemployment, making a living difficult. With many mouths to feed and few to produce, it's unknown how long this abnormal situation can be maintained. However, the seriousness of the situation is increasing daily, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>The city was bombed again a few days ago, resulting in numerous casualties. It is possible that large-scale tragedies will occur again in the future. Therefore, evacuating the population is a matter of urgency. Those who are willing should evacuate as soon as possible, and those who are forced to evacuate should also be implemented promptly to reduce consumption, casualties, and the extent of damage.</p>
<p>The current environment makes choosing difficult, which is also a fact. A few days ago, some people who had voluntarily evacuated back to their hometowns came out of the countryside, saying that the countryside was not peaceful and the cost of living was not much lower than in Shanghai. On the contrary, it was more difficult to make a living. For example, in Shanghai, mending shoes, running a small stall, being a servant, or even begging can at least maintain one's personal livelihood, while in the countryside, there is no way to do so. Therefore, it was reported in the newspapers a few days ago that Shanghai, in the midst of an evacuation movement, was instead experiencing a counter-evacuation, with the population increasing daily. After this bombing, there may be people who voluntarily evacuate again, but I am afraid that after a while, they will quietly return.</p>
<p>To prevent counter-evacuation, we believe that before implementing evacuation, we must first restrict entry. If we only evacuate without restricting entry, the city's population will inevitably leave in one batch, only to return, or be replaced by another batch, which would be equivalent to no evacuation at all. Therefore, we hope that the municipal authorities, while actively promoting evacuation, will implement the following four points to stop unnecessary immigration (excluding births):</p>
<p>Re-verify household registrations. Those without proper employment should be forced to return to their hometowns at their own expense or with assistance. Those who are not residents of this city should be given a deadline to leave.</p>
<p>Restrict travelers to prevent merchants from other places from staying for extended periods.</p>
<p>Restore security in the surrounding countryside so that rural residents can live in peace.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Save Electricity in Exchange for Tap Water</h3>
<p>— Han Du</p>
<p>Recently, cholera has been rampant, and the demand for water for drinking and general use has increased significantly. As a result, many citizens have exceeded their tap water limits and have been fined. Under the pressure of the ever-increasing cost of living, this unexpected threat is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly discussed the tap water problem, either suggesting that the authorities increase the limits or advising citizens to conserve. However, neither has been very effective in practice. Here is a suggestion for the authorities, I wonder if it can be adopted? It is known that tap water and electricity originally belonged to the same company. Now that it is mid-summer, the days are long and the nights are short, and citizens' consumption of electricity is optional. However, due to the long and hot summer, the need for tap water will inevitably increase, but they suffer from the limited quota. I think that since tap water and electricity belong to the same company, the company should consider the needs of the citizens and announce a win-win solution: use a certain number of kilowatt-hours of electricity in exchange for a certain number of units of tap water. The number of electricity kilowatt-hours for each household could be converted into tap water quotas, so that what is used for electricity can be used for tap water. This would transform something useless into something useful for citizens. For the company, the cost of electricity production can be transferred to the production of tap water, without increasing expenses. As for income, the electricity fees remain electricity fees, and the tap water fees remain tap water fees, without any reduction. Such a mutually beneficial solution only requires the company to make a public announcement. I don't see any difficult problems to solve, but there may be technical difficulties, which I am not aware of.</p>
<h3>Criticism of Next-Day Clearing of Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<p>— Shi Hao</p>
<p>I recently read in the newspaper that "the banking and money exchange industries...the number of negotiable instruments has increased frequently, and the clearing procedures have become increasingly complicated, resulting in an increase in the daily exchange difference and the number of returned instruments...Disputes have also arisen frequently as a result. To solve the problem...they are discussing next-day clearing of negotiable instruments..." Based on this analysis, the cause is the increase in negotiable instruments, the difficulty is the increase in exchange difference and the number of returned instruments, the result is frequent disputes, and the remedial measure is next-day clearing. After careful consideration, it can be found that this remedial measure is not very clever.</p>
<p>First, same-day clearing has nothing to do with the exchange difference, unless some negotiable instruments are left out, but this is related to the management structure and efficiency of each bank. Busy banks naturally need and are able to hire more staff. Therefore, it is extremely unreasonable to resort to next-day clearing for this reason.</p>
<p>Second, most returned instruments are caused by insufficient capital turnover. If next-day clearing is implemented, the capital turnover will be even slower, which will definitely increase the number of returned instruments, so disputes will definitely arise more frequently.</p>
<p>Third, if next-day clearing is implemented, assuming that a bank or money exchange receives a negotiable instrument on the afternoon of one day, because the bank or money exchange is already closed, it can only be deposited on the second day, cleared on the third day, and it will not be known until the fourth day whether it will be returned. If it is not returned, it can only be withdrawn on the afternoon of the fourth day. Counting from the first day to the fourth day, there is a difference of three days. Not counting the interest on the delay, it is extremely inconvenient, which is equivalent to lowering the utilization rate of negotiable instruments. As a result, merchants and citizens will be more afraid of negotiable instruments and want cash. Some merchants and citizens will inevitably discriminate against negotiable instruments and refuse to accept them. As a result, it will indirectly make the practice of discounting more rampant, and small citizens will suffer even more.</p>
<p>Fourth, the difficulty of clearing procedures does not necessarily require next-day clearing. If the clearing time is delayed by one or two hours, and the banks add more staff, or temporarily transfer idle staff to the reconciliation department, it will be easier to close the books on the same day and avoid negotiable instruments being left out. Negotiable instruments must be cleared on the same day. The law has clear provisions, which shows that it has its legal basis and needs. Now there are other methods that are not adopted, and it is necessary to change the legally prescribed same-day clearing to next-day clearing. I don't know what the reason is. Moreover, the current increase in negotiable instruments is a temporary phenomenon. Once the Central Bank provides a large amount of cash, the number of negotiable instruments will decrease.</p>
<p>In short, next-day clearing will inevitably promote the evil practice of discounting and make merchants and citizens feel inconvenient. I hope that the banking and money exchange industries and the Finance Bureau will consider the difficulties of the people and reconsider.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Credit of Checks</h3>
<p>— Mu Gong</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the check system was originally to avoid the trouble of transferring cash. It is simple, clear, and very convenient to replace it with a check. This system is built on reliable and credible checks. The value of this check must be fully equivalent to its face value, and there is no risk of being dishonored or suffering losses. It is a security with independent credit. However, in our country, the credit of a check completely relies on the credit of the individual, and if separated from the individual, the check has no intrinsic value, even though there are legal regulations. Looking at the market recently, because there is not enough cash, it has to be replaced by negotiable instruments, but its scope is limited to familiar people, so that it can pass without obstacles. Among strangers, there is still a gulf of mistrust, even if they reluctantly accept promissory notes from banks, it is still necessary to copy down the residence certificate. Therefore, negotiable instruments in our country still cannot get rid of the nature of "vouchers." Therefore, the reason for the failure to expand is because checks have been used too poorly in the past.</p>
<p>How can the credit of checks be strengthened? It is to avoid the abuse of checks. This can be said from two aspects:</p>
<p>From the perspective of the drawer, the abuse of checks is often caused by unscrupulous drawers. The reason is that there are no deposits and the checks are used as a tool for deception; there are also cases where the funds have not been received, and the pre-paid checks are not cashed when they are due. Of the above two reasons, the former is fundamentally a rascal, and the latter is equally unfaithful, but still justifiable. For the sake of check usage, it seems that both are unacceptable. It seems that every drawer should cherish his own reputation. For the sake of the entire negotiable instrument system, it should be even better.</p>
<p>From the perspective of banks, according to negotiable instrument regulations, only banks and money exchanges can act as check payers. Therefore, banks and money exchanges are also a key point in strengthening the check circulation plan. In my opinion, the industry should at least pay attention to two points: (A) Strictly handle the opening of current accounts. If a recommendation from a person well-known to the bank is required, otherwise, they may be asked to provide more than two business firms, and after consulting the bank and receiving a reply confirming that they are of good character and have a proper occupation, a checkbook may be issued and allowed to transact. It is absolutely impossible to covet profits and attract customers indiscriminately. If some banks have very small amounts of money to open a check account with a residence permit, under this condition, anyone can have a checkbook in hand. The reliability of such a check is of course difficult to believe. (B) There should be strict sanctions for dishonored checks. If a check is dishonored twice, the transaction should be stopped and the checkbook should be taken back. If some banks only charge a certain handling fee for dishonored checks, it seems that they do not pay enough attention to the credit of checks, or it may cause industrial and commercial circles to dishonor checks in this bank. It is not worth the loss if the problem is not treated effectively.</p>
<p>I believe that if everyone takes the responsibility of strengthening the use of friendly checks on their shoulders, then checks will have no risk of being dishonored, and the trouble of transferring cash can be avoided, and there will be no problem with the circulation of negotiable instruments. Because of the circulation and the many people who sign the old books, the credit of negotiable instruments will tend to be strengthened, which will make checks become a security with independent credit, and everyone can enjoy its convenience. This is not a luxury, perhaps we will find that there is too much cash.</p>
