<h3>琉球本島日守備隊　展開壯烈邀擊戰　名護灣敵企圖登陸受重創</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　琉球本島之戰况，已逐步熾烈化，雙方刻正展開壯烈之激戰。敵軍四千自八日晨以來，由海空於熾烈砲擊及地上猛烈砲火之掩護下，以不下百輛之戰車羣為先針，對首里北方之日軍陣地出動全面攻勢，尤以中央部戰綫之戰鬥極為激烈。敵方前綫情報亦承認日軍陸上部隊，已開始正規之反攻戰，敵軍於日軍勇敢善戰之前，已陷苦戰狀態中，同時一部敵軍由於日軍壯烈之突擊戰，乃不得已而潰亂。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　琉球本島附近之敵，企圖向各地登陸，七日晚伴同戰車一百三十輛步兵約五千名，由名護灣企圖向名護登陸，經日軍與之邀擊後，使其戰車二十五輛擱置燃燒，並殺傷其他工作人員約四百名。又於中城灣津堅島登陸之敵舟艇有六十艘。</p>
<p>某某基地十日中央社電　敵艦艇二艘於八日下午侵入冲繩東側中城灣，該地日軍轟沉大型驅逐艦一艘，並重創小型艦艇一艘，敵軍一部在津堅島登陸。</p>
<h3>日水上特攻隊　猛襲敵艦羣　轟沉巨型驅逐艦一艘</h3>
<p>某基地十日中央社電　日水上特攻隊八日下午於中城灣口津堅島附近，攻擊敵艦艇羣，轟沉大型驅逐艦一艘，重創船艇一艘，別動隊復攻擎石垣島四周之巡洋艦隊，予以損害甚大，戰果詳情未明。冲繩島周圍有敵戰艦八艘，巡洋艦驅逐艦三十餘艘，其他艦艇合計百艘以上，向陸上日軍陣地不斷砲擊，數日來因天氣惡劣；海空戰尙未達熾烈程度</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日陸海空特攻隊於五日軍之護送及捕給而蠢動於冲繩海面之美艦船羣實行猛攻，予敵以重創。茲據瑞典京城訊稱：美國之沖繩作戰，遭蒙日本之最強抵抗，刻喪失艦船頗多，而暴露美軍之遭莫大損害，今美國更由於日特攻隊之迎續强襲，致心驚膽喪，無從措手。目下冲繩海面之美艦船，自遭受日軍之總攻擊以來，因損失龐大，故空母之艦載車亦逐漸減少，然敵旣已陷於進退維谷之勢，當不能坐視登陸部隊之窘困，故繼續力求增加補給，實行猛攻，急欲完成作戰。蓋冲繩周邊之戰鬥，與已往之作戰，實根本相違，今雙方均投全力於此一戰，故歸趨如何，實予今後戰局以莫大影響，因此戰爭已步人正規之決戰。</p>
<h3>伊舍堂隊建功　陸省授予感狀</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日陸軍省十日發表：伊舍堂隊三月二十六日晨克服各種困難，於冲繩西南方洋面，對以空母六艘為主幹之敵機動部隊，實行果敢之拼　攻擊，擊沉火型空母一艘，擊傷大型空母巾型空母及戰艦各一艘，其後復確認擊沉空母二·戰艦一，合計擊沉空母三·戰艦一，擊毀大型及中型空母各一·戰艦一，於冲繩島初度戰役中，予敵喪胆矣，其功勞殊大，茲對該隊隊長陸軍大尉伊舍堂用久等勇士，分別授予感狀。</p>
<h3>馬市東方日軍　綜合戰果</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫日軍基地九日中央社電　馬尼刺東方據點之日軍，反覆實行肉搏攻擊，予敵重創。自二月二十一日至三月二十日之一個月間，所獲戰果如次：斃敵八千四百九十三名，破壞或截獲重砲三十一門，迫擊砲三十六門，戰車十六輛，裝甲車十四輛，卡車三十六輛。</p>
<h3>盟邦海軍創敵制勝可操左券　凌海軍部長發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國府海長凌霄氏，頃發表談話如下：冲繩島戰事之瞻視，自敵美以及强力機動部隊在冲繩本島登陸以來，盟邦陸海空軍不斷以「特攻戰術」，予敵人以莫大創傷，最近戰局愈趨激化，盟邦海軍之水上部隊亦已出動，聯合陸空兩軍正作正規攻擊，故敵人雖擁有强大之機動部隊，所有各種艦船逾一千四之後，不但業受重大損害，沉毀艦船已達二百四五十艘之多，據九日盟邦大本營所發表之情報，敵機動部隊已呈潰退情勢。此次作戰，敵人方面且有英國之太平洋艦隊參加，其最有力之新式戰艦「喬治五世」號，已被特攻隊五機撞中，雖未沉沒，但已喪失戰鬥力，非經大修之後，不堪再用。於此，足見盟邦特攻隊之英勇善戰，足使敵人膽裂心寒，將來戰局之演進，必更有驚人之捷報傳來。太平洋戰爭已臨決戰階段，盟邦以其傳統精神與敵周旋，於天時地利人和三者俱優之環境下，殲敵制勝已操左券，加以盟邦內閣改組，陣容一新，最後勝之獲得，實屬毫無疑義。凡我黃種人應如何奮發鼓舞，以協力盟邦爭取勝利，此乃極重大之事，不容稍有徘徊者也。再者，敵人宣傳盟邦海軍已被消滅，此種虛偽宣傳，經此役盟邦海軍水上部隊之出擊，可以不攻自破，盟邦海軍必有以建樹奇績，以　東亞十億民衆之切望也，其拭目以俟之。</p>
<h3>褚外長談話</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　日軍在冲繩島對敵機動部隊大捷後，各方聞之莫不稱快。國府褚外長特就此發表談話稱：盟邦海軍昨今兩日戰果及情况，大本營已有詳細公佈，茲不復贅，以三數日之短期得如此之戰果，至堪欣賀。敵美自得硫黃島後，復攻冲繩，今遭受如此慘敗，竟有圖逃之訊，天厭强暴，於此可知。但在吾人而言，可賀可欣之意猶不在此，盟邦當戰局嚴重之際，內閣更新，國民視聽一致傾注，適於此際海軍將士竟奏如此偉功，以赫赫戰果轉移大局，其影響嚴重實難量比，盟邦新內閣之聲勢亦於此得見一般，充此能力而未來　功尤難限量，本人欣賀之餘，指明此點以吿國人。</p>
<h3>保衛祖國解放東亞　謀貫澈戰爭目標　日東鄕新外相對記者團談話</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日東鄕新外務大臣已於九日夜舉行親任式，十日下午與記者團初次會見時，特發表談話如次：戰時外交與軍事互為表裏，日本為貫澈戰爭之目的，必須採取果敢之施策，而細心運用之。開戰時天皇所頒之詔書已明顯佈告周知，日本由於英美不當之壓迫，瀕於存亡危急之秋，故在不得已中，為自衛而訴請十戈，此點偶於近來敵方發表之文書等中，為彼等所不注意之點，日本因此必須從事防衛祖國之戰爭而至結束為止，庶幾確立互惠平等之基礎，實現協和萬邦，大東亞各國家各民族之解放亦由此而漸次到來。日本之存亡與東亞之隆替，固擊於此一戰為其歸趨，故此即以一億國民為特攻隊作勇敢善戰之原因。英美兩國堅持制覇世界之陰謀，故意阻碍全人類之進步，恣意從事破壞之舉，彼等之野心實為擾亂世界和平之眞因，故吾人必當粉碎之。欲保衛悠遠之國體，及完成東亞諸國之自主獨立，乃日本戰爭之目的，而適合國際正義，於「破壞中求雞設」者，此即帝國之最大期望。故全國國民為鞏固完成戰爭目的之一信念，雖前途艱難，然吾深信戰爭目的之完遂，可指日而待也。</p>
<h3>東鄕任日外相　褚外長電賀　並電車光氏致意</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國府褚外交部長昨特電日本東鄕新外相致賀，同時並電重光前外相致意。茲將原電録后：</p>
<p>東鄕外務大臣閣下，敬悉閣下　任外相兼大東亞相，無任欣快。當此戰局緊急之際，閣下出任艱鉅，把握時機，以完成此重大使命，特電她賀，並祝閣下政躬康泰。</p>
<p>重光葵閣下，此次貴國內閣改組，閣下亦隨同辭職，本部長聆悉之餘，至為惋惜。回顧閣下出任外相兼大東亞相業已年餘，其豐功偉績，彪炳寰宇，深表無限之敬佩，以後尙望為國珍衛，實為企盼。</p>
<h3>日情報局次長由久富氏繼任</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日情報局緒方總裁卸任後，三好次長亦同時辭職，據十日之內閣會議，特起，用前情報局次長日本放送協會專任理事久富達夫氏繼其後任。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>論琉球羣島大戰果意義</h3>
<p>在盟邦日本為適應戰局要求，加强團結力果，由鈴木海軍大將出組新閣之際，琉球羣島中央以沖繩羣島為中心的戰爭，正以偉大的戰果不斷傳來，一方面表現盟邦陸海空軍作戰實力的堅强，粉碎了敵人的謀峪宣傳。一方面足以佐證日本鈴木新閣的成立，惟有加强團結，一心擊滅頑敵的態勢。</p>
<p>琉球羣島作戰，無論在地形上戰略上，對於整個東亞戰局具有極重大的意義，我們站在參戰國的地位，為期解放東亞的前途，不能絲毫漠視這次大戰果的意議。</p>
<p>依據日本大本營發表，自本月五日至七日黎明前為止，業已擊沉敵艦十五艘，擊毀九艘。七日午後偵察所得，在九州東南二百哩海面的敵方機動部隊，以制空航空母艦二艘及特設空母一艘為基幹，業已拖曳長達二千公尺的油跡而向東南遁走。至七日黃昏，冲繩木島東方的敵方機動部隊，經日軍勇猛邀擊，敵艦已有四五艘蒙受重創，結果已陷於大混亂狀態，向東遁走。而第二天敵方雖又反復來攻，又在慘重的損失下敗退，至少有十六艘敵舟艇被擊沉。據九日發表，自三月二十三日以來，盟軍已擊沉及擊破敵方艦船計達二百四十五艘之多！</p>
<p>這次敵方對硫球羣島的大舉侵犯，動員五個機動部隊，妄圖連戰速決，一舉獲逞。可是，截至目前為止，據日本大本營公布的戰果計算，業已有三個敵機動部隊，完全被擊覆滅；而其餘的兩個敵機動部隊，也都有一部分受到重大的損害。據軍事專家觀察，所以未被全部擊潰者，因為受到天氣惡劣影響的限制。然而，這里已經充分表現日本海陸空軍在本土防衛中的力量，也是第一次使敵方侵攻日本本土的戰略，遭受到嚴重的打擊。在嚴重打擊之後，敵方是否承認受到敎訓而改變戰略，我們雖不必預測，可是，至少敵人第二步的攻略已經因此而頓挫了。</p>
<p>日軍獲致這次大戰果的原因何在？很顯然的，日本並不如敵美一味依恃物質力量，正如我國兵法所謂「攻心為上」，最主要的在物質力量之外，更能激起軍民一致的敵愾心，以及決死衛國的精神團結的力量。誠如鈴木首相前日所指示：「吾人今日以美國為對象作戰，恰與日俄戰爭時之情況相同；是時日本元老認為日本不足以戰勝俄國，然結果日本在共戰不可的形勢下，終獲勝利。此次戰爭亦為非戰不可之形勢，故吾人最後勝利亦必獲得」。也就是我國兵法上的「置諸死地而後生」。現在盟邦在本土防術戰的緖戰中業已獲得這樣大的戰果，可以視為最近東亞整個戰局的轉捩點。在我們參戰盟國的中國和全東亞民族，亦必為之振奮鼓舞。雖然戰局前途尙有更大的艱險困難，但能團結十億民族，堅定必勝信念，那麽更大的艱險困難，正是最後勝利的前奏！</p>
<h3>平沼男爵繼任　樞密院議長　前晚舉行親任式</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　鈴木首相決定奏薦前任首相平沼騏一郎男爵，繼任樞院議長，九日上午十一時訪問後，已獲得諒解，於是日八時晉宮奏請裁可，當夜舉行親任式。</p>
<h3>日軍確保　老河口戰綫　佔領內鄕迫陜省邊境</h3>
<p>中央社訊　老河口為湖北省要衝，亦為駐渝美空軍基地之一，此次經日軍佔領，渝軍以日軍對內地之進擊，將愈形積極化，故感極度狼狽，渝方乃命令前線部隊嚴為防守。據最近渝軍委會發表：現在日軍已確保老河口戰線，並在河南省方面亦從南陽唐河鄧縣一帶，向西方進擊，佔領河南陝西之要衝內鄕，目下已進抵內鄕西方四十五公里相近陜西省邊境之浙川附近，文其北方在洛寗西南方長水鎭，雙方展開激戰。依照渝方發表，可知西安已受東南兩方面日軍威脅。英美渝曾宣傳稱，因太平洋戰局日趨緊張，故日軍對大陸之進擊，已呈微弱云云，然據渝方所迭次發表者，可證明日軍在中國大陸之擊滅戰，反見活潑展開，且重慶亦自認所受軍事成脅極為重大。如渝方所言，日軍如進抵南從漢江西側南漳經老河口光化，向北方迄李官浙水洛寗長水縣之一帶，則陝西省將受全面威脅。軍事上最近日軍動向，不問太平洋戰局如何，為擊滅渝軍，各處採取進擊態勢，尤以日軍進擊老河口及內鄕方面，可以想見從該方面經安康漢中而達重慶之進擊路氏巳吿開啓。日軍將直接進擊重慶，軍事消息靈通方面人士成作如此觀測云。</p>
<h3>緬甸日空軍　夜襲敵陣地</h3>
<p>緬甸前線九日中央社電　日軍夜間轟炸機隊，七日夜進攻勿恃刺地區敵陣上空，轟炸東飛機塲西側之滑翔路及其周圍之各項掩護設施，除有三處起火，一處大爆炸外，另一隊日機轟炸勿恃刺南方十公里附近公路上之敵軍輛隊，敵車輛當有數輛起火，日機一架未返基地。</p>

<h3>美雜誌充溢　不滿當局情緒　攻訐要人浪漫生活</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）據本市可靠方面消息：最近美國內雜誌時有不滿當局之措置，及要人之生活情形等消息披露，茲分誌如次</p>
<p>羅斯福次子購駿馬贈妻</p>
<p>美總統羅斯福次子　升航空代將，依照美國航空人員之晉級，如未　航空駕駛技術者，均不能晉級於將校階級，因此引起國內民衆之非議，而所有雜誌莫不羣起指責。據美雜誌所載內容稱：羅總統次子艾理埃德羅斯福，今年卅四歲，從軍至今四載，對於軍事上及航空上毫無經騐，由於學習較早，故昇級亦速，於一九四三年晉升上校，已為同僚所不滿，同時又派赴英，任空軍部隊長，因此該雜誌特指出美軍航空部隊將校任命之規定，凡無駕駛經騐者，不準任命部隊長，惟獨羅斯福次子之昇級，不勝奇怪，詎至今年美空軍總司令艾諾，又任命艾理埃德羅斯福任弋將職位，並稱在美國不諳駕駛技術者，僅艾理埃德羅斯福一人而已。繼之該雜誌復說明凡代將之任命，須獲得上院軍事委員會之批准後，方可任命，至今艾理埃德羅斯福之任命，猶未批准，是否尙未可知。査艾理埃德羅斯福原娶好萊塢女影星為妻，今自昇升代將後，艾理埃德羅斯福在英不勝歡忻，特選購駿馬八匹，從英運赴美國，送其夫人，於是又引起國內民衆之非議，以値茲戰時運輸困難之時，民需運輸已吿不易，彼竟優哉游者，致羣起譴責。</p>
<p>結婚十八載納爾遜脫輻</p>
<p>美遣渝經濟顧問納爾遜，年已五十六哉，近在國內竟鬧離婚笑話，前妻與納結褵已達一十八載，此次脫幅理由，實因納另有愛人，女名瑪加利柯蓬，芳齡僅二十六歲，於一九三九年為喬治登大學校花，此次納寵該女後，聞已不願再度赴渝云。</p>
<p>新幾內亞美軍患思鄕病</p>
<p>在新幾內亞之美國軍隊，最近莫不患思鄕病，惟因政府所頒服役歸國條件頗苛，雖欲還鄕，亦殊不易。據該雜誌所悉，舉凡呈准返國之軍人，必須有三個特殊情形，方獲核准：其一，軍人本身四肢有四分之三的殘廢，其二：因功獲得勳章二枚以上或徽章五枚以上，其三：患染有十二種惡性傳染病之一者，且須病勢至為厲害者，具有此三種特殊事山，始可批准返鄕，今經該雜誌調査所得，國外軍人得准返國具上述理由者，其年齡都超逾五十五歲以上，同時並聞從新幾內距赴美之路程，有人已認為幾成輸運死人之途。</p>

<h3>江灣之生產業</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>江灣位於上海之北，離市區約十二里，淞滬鐵路南北貫通，走馬塘更東西繞行，且公路四通，水陸交通均便。戰前賽馬之季，市面極為繁　，附近學校林　，現在已面目全非了。</p>
<p>麵粉業</p>
<p>事變以後，大規模的麵粉公司如福新·　豐等廠　曾一度停工，於是小型麵粉廠在三年前就如雨後春笋般的在江灣出現了七八家。這些工廠每家都只有一兩部機器，一二十個工人，生產糧每天約一百多袋。電力停止供給後，有幾家已改用木柴或柴油引擎，目已發電，但燃料消耗每部機　每日就耍木柴二十扒，柴油二十斤。現在小麥運輸極為不便，又正常靑黃不接之際，麥價每担價三萬以上，千方百計的零星收買到一些，再加上人工，所以製品不能用太低的價格賣出，近來銷路呆滯，二萬五六一袋也很少有人要，江灣鎭上的雜糧行·米店·粉號　，都有大堆麵粉，就實際營業說，　是門可羅雀，很少有人去問津。囚此福昌·江　兩麵粉廠，己經停工；現在只有松盛·公大·新大·源茂·源盛等五家，勉强維持着。據說：無錫·常州麺粉之種滬，封它們的打擊也</p>
<p>醬園業</p>
<p>江灣之豫盛醬園，在該業中頗有聲望，已創設七十多年，飛盛時期有職工五十餘，其醬油係用土　製造，生產時問，雖然緩慢，據化騐却極合營養，與新法化學製造完全兩樣。現因黃豆·豆餅·鹽等的來　困難，生產已陷於半停頓狀態。</p>
<p>榨油業</p>
<p>江　原有榨油廠二家，裕　公油廠已經停業，只有裕康油廠還改用柴油引擎在生產，不過產量極微，只可供本街用戶，而且成本高於常州·蘇北等地產品，無法競爭。最近北方靑　等地的豆油，旣不能運來，蘇北常州等地的油，也因為上海豆油限價較低，多運生他處，於是造成了油價上昇的現象。</p>
<p>當地晨業以種地棉花及菜蔬為主，但因事變關係，荒蕪甚多，河港亦不便修這，雖欲增產，無注進行。</p>
<p>由於戰等的　故，從前交通便利的江灣已成一個死市。米糧。柴草等　不易獲得，肉類菜蔬的價格也和上　市區不相上下。</p>
<p>體育</p>
<h3>女籃球友誼賽　綠隊戰雪白</h3>
<p>綠隊女子籃球隊為歡送該隊主將嚴蔚文，並祝嘪蔚文結婚起見，邀請　白籃球隊，定於今日下午四時，假大興路民立女中球塲，作友誼比賽。按綠隊屢獲各屆錦標，均為第一流名將，雪白自非其敵，亦所以聯歡之耳。</p>
<h3>籃球乙組賽</h3>
<p>昨賽戰果　振源勝晟友（乙七）十八—九，靑風勝南洋（乙五）廿二—十七，同益勝南華（乙五）卅七—十五。</p>

<p>本報市政周刋歡迎讀者對本市市政如敎育·衛生·財政·公用事業如水電交通等問題，就市民立塲，作具體建議。來稿請寄本　市政周刋編輯室，　　刋　，致酬　　。</p>

<p>周幼海先生對於救濟失學，素具熱忱。除多方贊助本報助學金外外，茲復將「申報月刋」及「風雨談」稿酬一萬四千元移助「義學金」，嘉惠清寒，彌足欽佩。</p>
<p>同情流露</p>
<p>小朋友　美琪·王之英·朱昌平·摟莉莉來函說：「貴報創辦義務小學，和謝立林先生發起設「　學金一，我們覺得很有意義。的確，現在失學的同學，實在太多了，現在我們把一月內的軍錢共計六千元，節省下來，捐助給貴報館，充作「義學金」。雖然數目極小，無補於事，但這不過是同情的流露，和互助精神的表現罷了。盼望其他在學的同學，多多捐助，使義務小學，更能擴展起來，使無數失學的兄弟姊妹們，都有求學的機會。」</p>
<p>夏光小學全體學生來函說：「貴報館創辦義務小學十所，免費招收失學兒童，我們年幼力薄，只好捐出一些舊書來，稍盡我們的責任。現在送上萬書二百九十六本，請檢收充義校課本。」</p>

<h3>Ryukyu Main Island Japanese Garrison Forces Stage a Heroic Counter-Attack, Enemy Attempt to Land at Nago Bay Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The battle situation on Ryukyu Main Island has gradually intensified, with both sides currently engaged in a heroic and fierce battle. Since the morning of the 8th, 4,000 enemy troops, under the cover of intense naval and aerial bombardment as well as heavy ground artillery fire, launched a full-scale offensive against the Japanese army's positions north of Shuri, led by a tank group of no less than a hundred vehicles. The fighting was particularly fierce along the central part of the battle line. Enemy front-line intelligence also acknowledges that Japanese ground forces have begun a formal counter-offensive. Faced with the brave and skillful fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy is struggling. At the same time, a portion of the enemy, due to the heroic surprise attacks by the Japanese army, was forced into disarray.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy near Ryukyu Main Island attempted to land at various locations. On the evening of the 7th, accompanied by 130 tanks and approximately 5,000 infantrymen, they attempted to land at Nago Bay. After being intercepted by Japanese forces, 25 of their tanks were left burning, and approximately 400 other personnel were killed or wounded. In addition, 60 enemy boats landed on Tsuken Island in Nakagusuku Bay.</p>
<p>A Certain Base, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Two enemy warships invaded Nakagusuku Bay on the eastern side of Okinawa on the afternoon of the 8th. Japanese forces in the area sunk a large destroyer and heavily damaged a smaller vessel. A portion of the enemy landed on Tsuken Island.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Special Attack Unit Fiercely Attacks Enemy Fleet, Sinking a Giant Destroyer</h3>
<p>A Certain Base, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the afternoon of the 8th, a Japanese naval special attack unit attacked enemy warships near Tsuken Island at the mouth of Nakagusuku Bay, sinking a large destroyer and heavily damaging one other vessel. Another detachment attacked the cruiser fleet around Ishigaki Island, inflicting significant damage. Details of the battle results are unclear. Around Okinawa Island, there are eight enemy battleships, over thirty cruisers and destroyers, and over a hundred other vessels, continuously bombarding Japanese army positions on land. Due to adverse weather conditions in recent days, naval and aerial battles have not reached a peak intensity.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese army, navy, and air force special attack units, under the escort and supply of the 5th Army, launched a fierce attack on the American warships scurrying on the waters of Okinawa, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. According to a report from Stockholm via Seoul, the American operation in Okinawa has encountered the strongest Japanese resistance, suffering considerable losses of warships, exposing the American military to immense damage. Now the United States is further alarmed and at a loss due to the continuous fierce attacks of the Japanese special attack units. Currently, the American warships in the waters off Okinawa have suffered enormous losses since the Japanese military's all-out attack, resulting in a gradual decrease in the number of aircraft on their aircraft carriers. However, the enemy, already trapped in a dilemma, cannot ignore the plight of the landing forces, so they continue to strive to increase supplies and carry out fierce attacks, eager to complete the operation. The battles around Okinawa are fundamentally different from previous operations. Now both sides are committing all their strength to this battle, so its outcome will have a significant impact on the future war situation. Therefore, the war has entered a formal decisive phase.</p>
<h3>Isado Unit Achieves Merit, Army Ministry Awards Commendations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 10th: The Isado Unit overcame various difficulties on the morning of March 26th, and carried out a courageous attack on the enemy's mobile unit, centered around six aircraft carriers, in the waters southwest of Okinawa. They sunk one aircraft carrier and damaged one large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, and one battleship each. Subsequently, it was confirmed that they had sunk two aircraft carriers and one battleship, totaling three aircraft carriers and one battleship sunk, and destroyed one large and one medium aircraft carrier each. In the initial battle of Okinawa Island, they terrified the enemy. For their great contributions, commendations have been awarded to the unit commander, Army Captain Isado Tatsuhisa, and other brave soldiers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Eastern Manila Reports Comprehensive Battle Results</h3>

<h3>Allied Navy Creating Victory, Commander Ling of Naval Department Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Ling Xiao, Head of the National Government's Naval Department, recently delivered the following speech: Looking ahead to the battle of Okinawa Island, since the enemy Americans and their powerful mobile units landed on Okinawa Main Island, the Allied land, sea, and air forces have continuously employed "special attack tactics," inflicting enormous damage on the enemy. Recently, the battle situation has become increasingly intensified. The Allied Navy's surface units have also been deployed, and they are jointly launching a formal attack with the land and air forces. Therefore, although the enemy possesses a powerful mobile unit of over 1,400 various ships, they have not only suffered significant damage, but the number of sunk and destroyed ships has reached as many as 245. According to information released by the Allied Headquarters on the 9th, the enemy's mobile unit is already showing signs of collapse. In this operation, the enemy side also had the British Pacific Fleet participating, and their most powerful new-style battleship, the "King George V," was struck by five special attack aircraft. Although it did not sink, it has lost its combat capability and cannot be used again without major repairs. From this, it is clear that the Allied special attack units are brave and skilled in combat, terrifying the enemy. Future developments in the war situation will surely bring even more astonishing news of victory. The Pacific War has reached a decisive stage. The Allies are fighting the enemy with their traditional spirit, and with the advantages of favorable timing, location, and popular support, defeating the enemy is a certainty. Furthermore, with the reorganization of the Allied cabinet and a new lineup, the final victory is undoubtedly assured. All of us yellow-skinned people should strive to inspire each other and cooperate with the Allies to strive for victory. This is a matter of utmost importance and allows no hesitation. Furthermore, the enemy's propaganda claiming that the Allied Navy has been annihilated is false. This falsehood has been exposed by the Allied Navy's surface units participating in this battle. The Allied Navy will surely achieve extraordinary feats, fulfilling the fervent hopes of the one billion people of East Asia. Let us wait and see.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army's great victory over the enemy's mobile units at Okinawa Island, everyone who heard the news was delighted. National Government Foreign Minister Chu specially released remarks on this, stating: The Allied Headquarters has already provided detailed information on the battle results and situation of the Allied Navy in the past two days, so there is no need to repeat them. Such battle results in a short period of three or four days are extremely gratifying. The enemy Americans, after obtaining Iwo Jima, then attacked Okinawa, and are now suffering such a disastrous defeat, with news of attempts to escape. Heaven despises violence, as can be seen from this. But for us, the meaning of celebration and joy lies not only in this. When the Allied war situation was critical, the cabinet was renewed, and the attention of the people was united, just at this time, the naval officers and soldiers achieved such a great feat, shifting the overall situation with their magnificent battle results. The impact of this is difficult to measure. The momentum of the new Allied cabinet can also be seen from this. With this ability, future achievements are even more difficult to limit. In addition to joy, I point this out to inform the people of the nation.</p>
<h3>Protect the Motherland, Liberate East Asia, Strive to Achieve War Objectives, New Japanese Foreign Minister Togo Speaks to the Press Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - New Japanese Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori held his inaugural ceremony on the evening of the 9th. When he met with the press corps for the first time on the afternoon of the 10th, he specially released the following remarks: Wartime diplomacy and military affairs are mutually reinforcing. In order to achieve the objectives of the war, Japan must adopt decisive policies and carefully implement them. The imperial rescript issued by the Emperor at the beginning of the war has been clearly announced and made known to all. Japan, due to the improper oppression of Britain and the United States, was on the verge of a life-or-death crisis. Therefore, in desperation, it resorted to war for self-defense. This point has been overlooked by the enemy in their recent publications. Therefore, Japan must engage in the war to defend the motherland until the end, so that it can establish a foundation of mutual benefit and equality and achieve harmony among all nations. The liberation of all countries and peoples of Greater East Asia will gradually come about from this. The survival of Japan and the rise and fall of East Asia are determined by this battle. Therefore, this is the reason why one hundred million citizens are acting as special attack units, fighting bravely and skillfully. Britain and the United States persist in their conspiracy to dominate the world, deliberately hindering the progress of all mankind, and arbitrarily engaging in destructive acts. Their ambitions are the true cause of the disruption of world peace, so we must shatter them. To protect our ancient national polity and complete the autonomy and independence of the countries of East Asia is the purpose of Japan's war. It is in line with international justice, and "seeking construction in destruction" is the greatest hope of the Empire. Therefore, with the unified belief of the entire nation to consolidate and achieve the objectives of the war, although the road ahead is difficult, I firmly believe that the completion of the war's objectives can be expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Togo Appointed Japanese Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Chu Sends Congratulatory Telegram, Also Sends Regards to Mr. Shigemitsu</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Significance of the Great Battle Results in the Ryukyu Islands</h3>
<p>In the Allied Japan, to adapt to the demands of the war situation and strengthen unity, as Admiral Suzuki formed a new cabinet, the war centered on the Okinawa Islands in the Ryukyu Islands has been constantly reporting great battle results. On one hand, it demonstrates the strong combat strength of the Allied land, sea, and air forces, shattering the enemy's propaganda. On the other hand, it is sufficient proof that the establishment of the new Suzuki cabinet in Japan is to strengthen unity and wholeheartedly eliminate stubborn enemies.</p>
<p>The operation in the Ryukyu Islands, whether in terms of terrain or strategy, has extremely important significance for the entire East Asian war situation. Standing in the position of a participating country, for the sake of liberating the future of East Asia, we cannot ignore the significance of this great victory.</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, from the 5th to before dawn on the 7th of this month, 15 enemy ships have already been sunk and 9 destroyed. Reconnaissance on the afternoon of the 7th revealed that the enemy mobile unit, 200 miles southeast of Kyushu, centered on two fleet aircraft carriers and one auxiliary aircraft carrier, had been dragging an oil slick of 2,000 meters long and fleeing southeast. By dusk on the 7th, the enemy mobile unit east of Okinawa Island had suffered heavy damage to four or five enemy ships after a brave interception by the Japanese army. As a result, it had fallen into great chaos and fled east. On the next day, although the enemy repeatedly attacked, they retreated in defeat with heavy losses, with at least sixteen enemy boats sunk. According to the announcement on the 9th, since March 23rd, the Allied forces have sunk and damaged as many as 245 enemy ships!</p>
<p>In this major invasion of the Ryukyu Islands by the enemy, five mobile units were mobilized, vainly attempting to fight a quick battle and achieve success in one fell swoop. However, as of now, according to the battle results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, three enemy mobile units have been completely annihilated, and the remaining two enemy mobile units have also suffered significant damage. According to military experts, the reason why they were not completely destroyed was due to the limitations imposed by adverse weather conditions. However, this fully demonstrates the strength of the Japanese naval, land, and air forces in defending the homeland. This is also the first time that the enemy's strategy of invading the Japanese mainland has suffered a serious blow. After this serious blow, we do not need to predict whether the enemy will admit to being taught a lesson and change their strategy, but at least the enemy's second step of conquest has been frustrated as a result.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for the Japanese army's victory in this great battle? It is very clear that Japan does not rely solely on material strength like the enemy Americans. As our military strategy says, "attacking the mind is paramount." The most important thing is that, in addition to material strength, it can also inspire a unified sense of enemy hatred among the military and civilians, as well as the spirit of national unity to defend the country to the death. As Prime Minister Suzuki pointed out the other day: "We are fighting the United States today in the same situation as during the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, Japanese elders believed that Japan was not sufficient to defeat Russia, but as a result, Japan ultimately won under the inescapable circumstances of joint warfare. This war is also a situation in which war is unavoidable, so we must ultimately achieve victory." This is also the "putting oneself in a deadly position and then surviving" in our military strategy. Now that the Allies have obtained such a great victory in the initial battle of the homeland defense war, it can be regarded as a turning point in the recent entire East Asian war situation. We, the participating Allied country of China and all the East Asian nations, will also be encouraged and inspired by this. Although the future of the war situation still holds greater dangers and difficulties, if we can unite the one billion people and firmly believe in victory, then greater dangers and difficulties are precisely the prelude to the final victory!</p>
<h3>Baron Hiranuma Succeeds as President of the Privy Council, Inauguration Ceremony Held the Night Before</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Prime Minister Suzuki decided to recommend former Prime Minister Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō to succeed as President of the Privy Council. After visiting him at 11:00 AM on the 9th, he obtained his understanding. He then went to the Imperial Palace at 8:00 PM on the same day to request approval, and the inauguration ceremony was held that night.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Secures the Laohekou Front, Occupies Neixiang on the Henan-Shaanxi Border</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - Laohekou is a strategic point in Hubei Province and also one of the bases for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. This time, after being occupied by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army believes that the Japanese army's advance into the interior will become more active, so it feels extremely embarrassed. The Chongqing side then ordered the front-line troops to defend strictly. According to the recent announcement by the Chongqing Military Commission, the Japanese army has now secured the Laohekou front, and in Henan Province, they are also advancing westward from the Nanyang, Tanghe, and Dengxian areas, occupying Neixiang, a strategic point between Henan and Shaanxi. At present, they have advanced to Zhechuan, about 45 kilometers west of Neixiang, near the border of Shaanxi Province. To its north, at Changshui Town, southwest of Luoning, fierce battles are unfolding between the two sides. According to the Chongqing side's announcement, Xi'an has already been threatened by the Japanese army from the southeast and east. Britain, the United States, and Chongqing have propagated that due to the increasingly tense Pacific war situation, the Japanese army's advance on the mainland has been weakening. However, according to the repeated announcements by the Chongqing side, it can be proven that the Japanese army's extermination war on the Chinese mainland is unfolding actively, and Chongqing also admits that the military threat it is receiving is extremely significant. As the Chongqing side says, if the Japanese army advances from the south along the west side of the Han River from Nanzhang through Laohekou and Guanghua, to the north to the area of Liguan, Zheshui, Luoning, and Changshui County, then Shaanxi Province will be threatened on all fronts. Militarily, the recent movements of the Japanese army, regardless of the Pacific war situation, are taking offensive postures everywhere in order to destroy the Chongqing army. In particular, the Japanese army's advance on Laohekou and Neixiang suggests that the offensive route from that direction through Ankang and Hanzhong to Chongqing has already been opened. People familiar with military news are making such observations, saying that the Japanese army will directly attack Chongqing.</p>

<h3>American Magazines Overflow with Dissatisfaction with the Authorities, Attacking the Romantic Lives of Important Figures</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch) According to reliable sources in this city: Recently, American domestic magazines have frequently disclosed news expressing dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures and the lifestyle of important figures. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Second Son Buys Steeds as Gift for Wife</p>
<p>The second son of American President Roosevelt, promoted to acting brigadier general, according to the American aviation personnel promotion system, those who do not possess aviation piloting skills cannot be promoted to officer ranks. This has aroused criticism from the domestic public, and all magazines have risen up to condemn it. According to the content published in American magazines, Roosevelt's second son, Elliott Roosevelt, is 34 years old this year and has been in the military for only four years, with no experience in military or aviation matters. Because of his early start in learning, his promotion has been rapid. He was promoted to colonel in 1943, which has already dissatisfied his colleagues. At the same time, he was sent to England to serve as the commander of an air force unit. Therefore, the magazine specifically pointed out the regulations of the American military aviation unit officer appointments, stating that anyone without piloting experience is not allowed to be appointed as a unit commander, but the promotion of Roosevelt's second son is strangely exceptional. Unexpectedly, this year, the Commander-in-Chief of the American Air Force, Arnold, appointed Elliott Roosevelt as an acting general, and stated that in America, Elliott Roosevelt is the only one who does not understand piloting technology. Subsequently, the magazine further explained that the appointment of an acting general must be approved by the Senate Military Committee before it can be finalized, and it is still unknown whether Elliott Roosevelt's appointment has been approved. It is noted that Elliott Roosevelt originally married a Hollywood actress as his wife. Now, since his promotion to acting general, Elliott Roosevelt is very happy in England and specially selected and purchased eight fine horses, which were transported from England to the United States to send to his wife. This has once again aroused criticism from the domestic public, as it is a time of wartime transportation difficulties, and civilian needs for transportation are already difficult to meet, yet he leisurely enjoys himself, leading to widespread condemnation.</p>
<p>After Eighteen Years of Marriage, Nelson Breaks Free</p>
<p>American economic advisor to Chongqing, Nelson, is already 56 years old. Recently, he caused a divorce joke in the country. His former wife had been married to Nelson for eighteen years. The reason for breaking free this time is because Nelson has another lover, a woman named Margaret Corbyn, who is only 26 years old. She was the beauty queen of George Washington University in 1939. After Nelson favored this woman, it is rumored that he is unwilling to go to Chongqing again.</p>
<p>American Soldiers in New Guinea Suffer from Homesickness</p>
<p>The American troops in New Guinea have recently been suffering from homesickness, but because the government has issued very strict conditions for returning home after service, it is very difficult to return home even if they want to. According to the magazine, soldiers who are approved to return home must have three special circumstances in order to be approved: First, the soldier himself has three-quarters of his limbs disabled; Second, he has been awarded two or more medals or five or more badges for merit; Third, he is infected with one of twelve malignant infectious diseases, and the disease must be very severe. Only those who possess these three special circumstances can be approved to return home. Now, according to the magazine's investigation, the soldiers abroad who are allowed to return home with the above reasons are all over 55 years old. At the same time, it is heard that the journey from New Guinea to the United States is considered by some to be almost a journey to transport the dead.</p>

<h3>Edible Oil Sales to Be Centrally Managed, in Order to Thoroughly Eliminate the Black Market</h3>
<p>The Edible Oil Industry Association of this city has recently observed that the oil market is chaotic, and retailers have no goods to sell in the market, which has severely affected the food supply of Shanghai citizens. In order to implement the government's economic policies and to restrain illegal transactions by industry members and non-industry members, the association has consulted with relevant authorities and key industry personnel, and is preparing to centrally manage the sales of industry members and strictly set market prices, in order to thoroughly eliminate the black market.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Shen Weiya, the chairman of the association, the current inventory of edible oil in the city is still abundant, but the chaos in the market price is actually caused by the illegal operation of a few industry members and non-industry members, which has created a panic. The association is now actively working to implement centralized management of sales, and at the same time is persuading industry members to comply with price limits and restore retail sales in stores to meet civilian needs.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan's Industries</h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>Jiangwan is located north of Shanghai, about twelve li from the city. The Songhu Railway runs through it from north to south, and the Zoumatang River winds around it from east to west. Furthermore, the highways are accessible in all directions, making land and water transportation convenient. Before the war, the market was extremely prosperous during the racing season, and there were many schools nearby. Now, it has completely changed.</p>
<p>Flour Industry</p>
<p>After the Incident, large-scale flour companies such as Fuxin and Rongfeng once suspended production. Therefore, small flour mills sprung up in Jiangwan like bamboo shoots after the rain three years ago, with seven or eight mills appearing. Each of these factories has only one or two machines and ten to twenty workers, producing approximately one hundred bags of flour per day. After the electricity supply was stopped, several mills switched to using firewood or diesel engines to generate electricity, but the fuel consumption for each machine is 20 dan of firewood and 20 jin of diesel per day. Now, wheat transportation is extremely inconvenient, and since it is the time of the year when the old crop is running out and the new crop has not yet arrived, the price of wheat is over 30,000 yuan per dan. After managing to buy some wheat piecemeal, plus labor costs, the finished product cannot be sold at too low a price. Recently, sales have been sluggish, and few people want it even at 25,000 or 26,000 yuan per bag. The grain stores, rice stores, and flour stores in Jiangwan Town all have large piles of flour, and in terms of actual business, they are as desolate as if no one ever comes to ask about it. Therefore, Fuchang and Jiangyuan flour mills have already stopped production. Now, only Songsheng, Gongda, Xinda, Yuanmao, and Yuansheng are barely maintaining production. It is said that the flour from Wuxi and Changzhou is also attacking them.</p>
<p>Sauce Garden Industry</p>
<p>Yusheng Sauce Garden in Jiangwan has a good reputation in the industry. It has been established for more than seventy years. During its peak period, it had more than fifty employees. Its soy sauce is made using traditional methods. Although the production time is slow, test results show that it is extremely nutritious and completely different from soy sauce made by new chemical methods. Currently, production has been reduced to a standstill due to the difficulty in sourcing soybeans, soybean cakes, and salt.</p>
<p>Oil Pressing Industry</p>
<p>There were originally two oil pressing factories in Jiangwan. Yuxin Oil Factory has already closed down. Only Yukang Oil Factory is still using diesel engines for production, but the output is extremely small, only enough to supply local users. Furthermore, the cost is higher than products from Changzhou and northern Jiangsu, making it impossible to compete. Recently, soybean oil from northern China and other places cannot be transported here, and the oil from northern Jiangsu and Changzhou is mostly transported to other places because the Shanghai soybean oil price limit is lower, which has caused the oil price to rise.</p>
<p>Local agriculture mainly focuses on growing cotton and vegetables, but due to the war, much of the land has been deserted, and it is also inconvenient to repair the river ports. Although there is a desire to increase production, there is no way to proceed.</p>
<p>Due to the war and other reasons, Jiangwan, which used to have convenient transportation, has become a dead city. Rice, grain, firewood, and grass are not easy to obtain, and the prices of meat and vegetables are similar to those in Shanghai's urban areas.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Youhai Transfers Manuscript Fees to Support Charity School Fund</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Youhai has always been enthusiastic about rescuing those who have dropped out of school. In addition to providing various sponsorships to this newspaper's scholarship fund, he has now transferred 14,000 yuan in manuscript fees from "Shen Bao Monthly" and "Talking about the Storm" to support the "Charity School Fund," benefiting the poor and cold, which is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Expressions of Sympathy</p>
<p>The children, Meiqi, Wang Zhiying, Zhu Changping, and Lou Lili, wrote: "We feel that your newspaper's establishment of compulsory elementary schools and Mr. Xie Lilin's initiation of the 'Charity Scholarship Fund' are very meaningful. Indeed, there are too many students dropping out of school now. We are now donating our month's worth of pocket money, totaling 6,000 yuan, to your newspaper to be used as the 'Charity Scholarship Fund.' Although the amount is very small and cannot make up for the shortage, it is just an expression of sympathy and a manifestation of the spirit of mutual assistance. We hope that other students in school will donate more to make compulsory elementary schools even more widespread, so that countless brothers and sisters who have dropped out of school will have the opportunity to study."</p>
<p>All the students of Xiaguang Elementary School wrote: "Your newspaper has established ten compulsory elementary schools, enrolling out-of-school children for free. We are young and weak, so we can only donate some old books to do our part. We are now sending 10,296 books, please accept them as textbooks for the charity schools."</p>
<h3>Continuing to Send Free Injury Treatment Vouchers</h3>
<p>Lin Zhentang has always been enthusiastic about charitable undertakings, printing free injury treatment vouchers and distributing them to the poor and sick, and entrusting the martial arts master Mr. Tong Zhongyi to be in charge of medical affairs. A total of 150 copies were entrusted to this office for distribution. Now, 50 more copies have been sent. Those in need can obtain them from this office. However, due to the high cost of medicine, the cost is at least several hundred for minor injuries and thousands for serious injuries, so they are limited to the poor and sick. The clinic is located at 23, Lane 124, South End, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. Hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Serious illnesses are treated immediately upon arrival. The Houfeng Paperboard Company, located at 45 Baike Road, Tongchunfang, also distributes these free vouchers.</p>
<p>Zhongde Hospital Offers Preferential Treatment to Mothers The Zhongde Obstetrics Hospital at 457 Luoyang Road has added more than forty beds in its civilian department.

However, Mr. Tao, with his benevolent heart, does not wish to have unnecessary celebratory expenses during these difficult times and firmly declined to accept gifts. Therefore, the colleagues have converted the congratulatory gifts into 200,000 yuan in cash and sent it to your esteemed organization to be used for the operating expenses of the Nanshi Elderly Home, for the benefit of Mr. Tao and his relatives and friends."</p>
