<p>前綫基地十四日中央社電　日航空部隊於十四日黎明攻擊冲繩島及附近海面之敵艦，予以重創。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據大富島來電稱，尼米資司令部十三日發表如次：六月五日美第三艦隊於菲律賓及冲繩之間，因遭猛烈颶風而損傷艦艇達二十一艘，其中包括有新銳戰艦「亞拉巴馬」號，「印第安納」號，「馬薩諸塞」號及「埃塞克斯」號等航空母艦五艘，巡洋艦「匹茲堡」號之艦首，被浪損去百呎，現正積極修理，其他損傷艦艇，仍在參加作戰，是日之颶風速度，據稱時速爲一六六至二二零海里。</p>

<p>證明冲繩戰敵受重創</p>
<p>前綫航空基地十四日中央社電　冲繩戰鬥中慘敗退至雷伊泰，烏爾西方面後方基地之敵機動部隊，未幾復整頓陣容，於十日晨接近日木本土，出動艦載機，對開東地區航空基地來襲。此項機動部隊以僅存之制式空母雷克辛第二及愛塞克斯，印　本特期等爲主力，混以改造空母而組成，然其攻擊技術之低劣，爲向來所未見，此因爲敵機動部隊爲日軍痛擊，蒙創過重之具體證據。其航空技術亦極低劣，累計一千二百架之大編隊，僅能敷衍塲面而已，其技術之低劣，與冲繩基地起飛之戰鬥轟炸聯合福隊如出一轍，此乃證明冲繩作戰敵機動部隊及海上勢力已受有重創矣。冲繩作戰之際，敵機因發動機發生障礙，屢次發生被迫降落情事，由此可知自誇物量豐富之敵軍，其在冲繩作戰，已限入不可自拔之窘境。</p>

<h3 id="c11">島田班長　談大陸登陸戰　渝方心理上之矛盾 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>上海日本陸軍部報道班長島田中佐，於昨（十四）日午前在循例報道當會席上，答覆本巿各報社記者所提出之「敵美誇大宣傳之大陸登陸戰」等問題，島田班長發表見解如次：</p>
<p>敵將在歐洲兵力轉移東亞，以視空軍及陸軍兵力而論，空軍移動較速，而陸軍則頗費時日。至早須於木年十月後，登陸方可實現。敵在太平洋集結兵力，向中國大陸登陸之可能性，須視其規模如何。倘如敵閏在大陸登陸，則必亂擁有　大之兵力。目前敵美之戰術，尙在運用大規模轟炸日本本土，破壞中小城巿以及交通綫等。萬一敵美向大陸登陸，以東南海岸如廣東及福建諸地較爲可能。</p>
<p>最近蔣介廠在三次演說中，曾提及美軍在中國大陸登陸事，　稱渝軍之自力總反攻，須由美國積極予以軍火及經濟上之援助，則自信可以實現云云。對美軍之登陸，頗示不願見其實現之意，但同時又盼美國予以援助，其心理之予盾，顯然可見。</p>

<p>南京十四日中央社電　財政部次長陳之碩氏，十四日上午十時在該部會議室，接見京市中日新聞記者，就該部最近施政概况，發表如下：</p>
<p>金融力面，近因市面現鈔缺乏，滬地爰有撥款單之發生，弊　業生，折現之風盛行，刺激物價上漲，影響甚巨，財部有鑒及此，乃限令停止撥款單流通，改由銀行開立木票，然猶有少數銀行濫發本票，致使滬地物備動　不元，日前令飭中儲檢查金融事務處，已將檢査結果若干違法行莊，吊銷執照，或嚴加懲罰，滬地物價定能由此稍平。</p>
<p>鹽務調整方面，對廳務今後施政，擬偏重於適合現實，過去之中華裕華兩家公司業已解散，今後運銷兩方決採統一制度，分區招商承包，統一運銷事宜，政府從旁協力，刻下招商承包工作，業於六月十八日截止，經過情形極爲良好，各方投資頗爲踴躍。鹽稅方面自七月一日起，增繳爲三千元一擔。</p>

<h3 id="c25">論銀行本票與增發通貨 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 史眞</p>
<p>最近市面上銀行本票發行之濫，猶如過江之鯽，同時中儲當局雖然竭力寬放行莊的頭寸，可是就存戶所領到的存款說，不過比較以前稍寬，仍不能滿足正當需要。由於銀行木票的濫發，所能引起的第一個影響，便是物價的上漲。同時存戶需要現鈔，超過其所能領到的數量時，祗有向黑市貼現。換句話說，便是增加人民不應有的負担和痛苦。當局禁止撥款單而准發本票，除了造成行莊的優越地位外，可說更增加了人民的無謂痛苦和損失。銀行發行本票，原爲應顧客的要求，便利現金支付，與携帶方便，可是今日行莊的發行木票，不但不是出於顧客的要求，而且有强迫顧客接受的用意。其惟一藉口，爲現鈔不足，而其所　起的惡果，則爲信用膨服，物價上漲，試分析如次：</p>
<p>銀有本票票的信用問題銀行開發　　軍代替現鈔時，已引起物價的上漲，但撥款單有中備和銀錢兩準備會做後盾，準備充足，尙不能與現鈔相比擬，何况銀行本票，上海的銀行錢莊良莠不齊，其間不無以投機爲業務者，害羣之馬，足以累及全體，所以就銀行本票的信用說，較之撥款單更不如，實有限制的必要，此其一。</p>
<p>銀行本票的發行問題　撥款單須經交換手續，核算存放頭寸，發行時尙有顧慮，可是，最近的三十五家行莊，利用地位，濫發撥款單，已爲不可諱言的事實。何况銀行本票的發行，旣然不亂經交換手續，也可無須核算存放頭寸，在所謂十日以內提未的掩護下，不無放胆濫發，毫無顧忌者。所以，自從七月三日以來，銀行頭寸，從米緊過，物價股票黃金等等，祇漲不回，與本票充斥不無關係，對於民生，有百吿而無一利，實有限制必要，此其二。</p>
<p>銀行木票的僞造問題　銀行本票僞造發生，均足使人民蒙受損失，銀行對於僞造，自易於發覺而退票，但商店個人除追得原主外，祇有自認損失。以前撥款單所發生的僞造，決不因使用銀行本票而消失，且變木加厲，更有限制的必要，此其三。</p>
<p>因此，銀行發行本票，對於銀行本身雖有百利，而對於國家和人民，則並無一得。其目前一部分銀行發行本票，更有功長貼現之害。所謂貼現，即銀行以領得現鈔，不以之轉給存戶，而以之高價貼　，博取厚利。銀行本身與行員朋比爲　。最近向銀地提現，剛如上川江而登棧道，無非利之所在，強而不捨罷了。</p>
<p>更進一步言，銀行發行木票的利益，除了代替現鈔，所以大批現鈔，可以從後門去貼現以外，並可製造信用購製物資。戰時物價勢必逐漸上漲，因爲銀行本票的濫發，物價更易上漲，何况銀行木票不須拆息，十天到期後最多不過提示和換發一張新的本票，最近烚赤華股有漲無跌，便是頭寸大鬆，便是本票從巾作崇的原因，一個小銀行，平均每月多發木票一萬萬元，不算稀奇，一個月烚赤華股上漲一倍，亦不算稀奇，由於銀行的幕後拉抬，一個小銀行因爲濫發本票，每月至少有一萬萬元以上的收入，無怪最近一部分銀行職員，多是意氣高傲腦滿腸肥，而其他一般薪水階級和普通人民，因爲物價和現鈔的雙重剝削，反更顯得面黃肌搜，朝不保夕。</p>
<p>總之，發行銀行本票和限制提取現鈔，祗是一個問題的兩面，絕對有其聯繫性，而銀行本票，並不能做到木票現鈔等値的地位，尤其在今日銀行林立，物資缺乏的時候，銀行濫發本票，限制提取現鈔，實有嚴加取締的必要。三十二年十二月一日起，中儲檢查金融事務處，取締金融機關發行遠期本票，一方面健全金融之機構，一方面深得人民之信仰，可是當時本票的發行，數量有限，其害並不顯著，然而當局已綢繆未雨，防微杜漸，迄今不過一年有餘，何以准許銀行濫發本票，陷於自相矛盾的地位，難道以爲十天期限，便可無碍嗎！應知十天之期，不過是一種取巧辦法，到期提示，不付規鈔，不過再換一張又是十天提示的本票而已。如此輾轉掉期，試問銀行遠期本票，與銀行近期木票，有何區別？而且中儲的通貨，所收縮的程度有限或且無法收縮，而銀行的本票，倒可乘機大發而特發，不但市塲的通貨籌碼，祗有增加，而且似乎中儲的通貨發行特權，也與各行莊平分了，豈是戰時統制金融所應有的現象。中儲一行的膨脹通貨，較之各行同時發行木票，同時膨照信用者，爲害之孰州孰輕，不待智者而知。深望金融當局，詳加考慮，與其准許各行莊發行本票，不如痛痛快快增發通貨，藉以剔除中國人的剝削，而謀減輕人民的負担。</p>

<p>蘇聯的紅軍，用這種火砲不絕　擊德軍陣地，傾注龐大的　量。反之，英美作戰的方式，則出動絕對多數的機羣，用空軍的威力攻繫德國。英美軍的戰車，多數是小型的，而且也不怎樣領秀。參加來比錫大戰的德軍將校，曾如此說過。然而，在英美戰車羣的上空，却不絕有其空軍掩護前導，每在戰車羣尙來進抵一城一市以前，英美機羣便已實行可怖的轟炸，不問是都市或是村落，一律將其炸成平地，因此，德軍不得不放衆對付這小型戰車的火砲，粉紛後退，結果有許多地方簡直毫無抵抗，一任這種小刑載車肄意蹂躪。英美軍並用「空中列車」不斷補充軍需品，所以德軍縱然將鐵路公路澈底破壞，也不能減低英美戰車羣的進擊速度。</p>
<h3 id="c27">德缺修理材料 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>對於空襲的破壞，德國修理恢復的速度，起初確實令人　　，平常須一個月始能修好的重大損害，在德國只需兩三小時，即可修理完善，恢復原狀。鐵橋被炸而落入河中，不久即用巨大的起重機，將它拉起來，數小時以後，又照原來的樣子，重新架在河上了。其他如工廠·鐵路·建築物，一切都是如此。然而，去夏以來，英美機羣的空襲日益頻繁，而修理的材料又漸吿廣乏。結果恢復原狀的速度日見低下，終於鐵道網也被寸寸戴斷了。此外，縱橫國內的公路，也因羅馬尼亞的喪失，汽油宜吿不足，而難以充分利用。於是叮稱爲內綫作戰之生命的機動性，完全喪失。而且，德國境內運種良好的高速度汽東路，如欲加以破壞，則因它過於長大，並且堅固，大有毀不時毀之感，結果，一待戰場移至國內，這種公路反爲敵軍利用，而充分發揮其機動性了。「眞不錯呀，這些路！」沿着這種近代化公路前進的蘇聯機械化部隊，常常發出如此的　嘆之聲。今日，德國巴成廢墟，只有這些公路尙留　表明德國文化的成就。</p>
<h3 id="c28">德國的優點 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>德國最後雖然不免一敗，但是可從德國學習的地方，是很多的。例如根據其科學才能的計畫性，即是其中之一。至其國民動負的澈底，也很可稱道。爲了補充前機龐大的人力損失，速家庭婦女也被動員，甚至有小孩的母親，也動員起來，其人數達二百萬多，結果，德軍當局纔能够由工廠襄抽辦五百萬的兵力到前綫去。而得生力軍補充者，也有妥善的安排，絕無人浮於事或工作不合其能力的現象。即在最初的時期，生產方面也沒有因爲男女工人交替之故，而發生能事低下的事。　當局早就慮及家庭婦女的煩瑣家務，其工作時間恒取三班或四班輪流的制度，而竭力減少休息時間。其後，空製愈烈，工廠設備被毀者增加，而修復工作的進行，又不如意，以致有不少人員失去工作的塲所，因而將一部分人員解除動員，或調往其他要緊的工廠裏去工作。此項措置，直到最後，都順利而公正的進行着。</p>
<p>尤其在糧食政策方面，更毫無遺憾的發揮其計畫性，一切都施行完善的票證制。只要有配給證，麵包·奶油·砂糖·蔬菜·肉類等，皆可購得，而且其分量直到最後都無變更。（譯自每日新聞）（續完）</p>

<p>近日大時炎熱不堪，大家精神似乎稍感苦悶，因而連累到我們助學金的勸募，也遲遲不進，認隊寥寥；這一點使我們，尤其是直接影響的數千淸寒子弟，感到非常焦慮。依照我們的預算，每天平均有一千萬元以上的捐款，一個月後可募足三萬萬元，倘使照最近八九天來每天多則二三百萬，少則三四十萬捐款的情形，未免太可憐了！偌大的上海，股富人士，誠如汗牛充棟，而大家對此爲國育材的社會公益，竟至漢不關心，未免太冷酷了。</p>

<h3 id="c51">馬鈴薯概說 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 趙武</p>
<p>當此米糧缺乏，提倡搭吃雜糧之際，對於雜糧品類及增產雜糧之介紹，不無需要。馬鈴薯爲雜糧之一種，本文就共品種性狀及栽培方法加以概說，足供關心雜糧問題者之參考。本文作者趙君係聖約翰大學農學院濃塲主任，並此介紹。</p>
<p>近年來我國因天災人禍，農產物常遭　收，稻麥等主要食糧不敷供給，遂提倡栽培雜糧作物，以補不足，其中尤以馬鈴薯一項，爲雜糧中之新貢獻，栽培地域之廣，幾遍及全球。當十八世紀時，歐西各國已有人提倡種植，惟因西人喜麥食，已相沿成習，故不能普及。至十八世紀末，歐洲糧食發生恐慌，遂竭力提倡廣植馬鈴薯。至十九世紀初，耕種技術進步，產量豐富，遂爲主要農產品之一，馬鈴薯之食用部份，係地下之境莖，果實肥碩，富澱粉及糖分，除供食糧外，可作工業原料用（如提煉澱粉及酒精），馬鈴薯對於各地風土均甚適宜，如與其他農作物輪流種植，可以改良土地增加生產力。</p>
<h3 id="c52">性狀 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>馬鈴薯屬茄科之一年生草本作物，爲南美之智利秘魯等高原地之原產，其性狀略述於後：</p>
<p>根——爲纖維狀根系，深入土壤中約二尺左右，惟不甚發達。</p>
<p>華——分地上莖與地下莖，地上莖爲着生緣葉，行同化作用，高二三尺，地下莖稱爲發莖，其頂端發育膨大，形成球莖，呈橢圓形或腎臟形，富含澱粉質及糖分，可供煮食或充工業原料用，外皮呈白黃或淡紅色，皮上有凹陷，俗稱眼生，有隱芽種，植後即由此芽發育而生長。</p>
<p>葉——互生呈羽狀複葉，有長葉柄，葉形補圓，色澤濃綠，柔軟多汁。</p>
<p>花——蕊及冠皆分五瓣，各瓣相連成管狀，爲繳狀花序，花色有淡白紫色及淡黃等。（未完）</p>
<p>果實——爲圓形或扁圓形，甚小，中含種子，可供繁殖，但遺傳性甚劣，故除用爲育成新種外，罕有以爲繁殖老。</p>
<h3 id="c53">功用 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>馬鈴薯爲歐美各國之主要食品，或爲蔬菜及家畜之飼料，在我國恒以爲副食品，更可以其混和粉麥，製麵包，並可爲製造澱粉及酒精之原料，其渣粕又可爲餧豚之飼料。</p>
<h3 id="c54">品種 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>馬鈴薯品種甚多，現已發現者有二千餘種之多，且每年有新發明者，如以用途而分有食用種工業用種及混合用種，如以成熱時期分者，計有早熟中熟晚熱等，茲分述於後：</p>
<p>（甲）食用種，味美質細，成熟期較早，塊莖大小適中，長圓形，皮上光滑而少眼，肉色白而帶黃，貯藏耐久，惟因早種，收獲量不甚豐富，適合種植於園圃之中。</p>
<p>（乙）工業用種，此種用以提煉澱粉及製造酒精，且供飼養牲畜用爲目的，產量豐富，含澱粉質多，且貯藏耐久，抗病力强，塊莖碩大，故在大面積種植之時，可用此種。</p>
<p>（丙）混合用種，此種馬鈴薯含澱粉質多，可充工業原料用，食味亦佳，故種植最爲普遍。</p>
<p>根據德國試騐成續，生長時期之早晚與產量之多少關係頗大，早生種自下種到成熟，經一百〇九天，每畝可收二千斤，澱粉質含量爲百分之十四·七，晚生種亂經一百三十二天始得成熟，每畝可收四千斤，含澱粉質百分之十八·八，晚生種因生長時期長，故產量豐富，含澱粉質多，抗病力强，故較早種爲優良。</p>
<h3 id="c55">栽培法 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>氣候　馬鈴薯性喜源爽之氣候，於中國南北各地均可栽培，然以溫帶氣候生育最良，收獲量多，在生長期內，不耐酷暑及亢早，雨量過多容易爛根，故不甚相宜。</p>
<p>土質　土質不拘，凡瘠薄之土，新開墾地，土壤乾燥而輕鬆處，均可種植，但欲得收量豐富。品質佳良，則須選擇輕鬆高燥肥活之砂質壤土或粘質壤土，且排水務須良好，是宜注意者，</p>
<p>施肥　馬鈴薯對於氮燐鉀三要素之需要量極多，尤以鉀質爲要，每畝約用腐熟堆肥二千斤，過燐酸石灰三十斤，硫酸鉀二十斤，或草木灰百斤，在種植之前，用作基肥一次施給之氮質肥料，用硫酸铔二十斤左右，或人糞尿二十擔，在種植後施用之。</p>
<p>整地　觀鈴薯在種植前，須先行耕耡，使土地鬆軟，塊莖得充分發育，如屬休閒地，則在冬季冰凍前深耕，使病菌害蟲之卵子凍死整地，在排水不良之低出，宜用高畦，高燥之地，可用平畦。</p>
<p>經種薯　選擇球莖之得法與否，能影響其收獲量，在馬鈴薯生長期中，先行選擇發育强健而無病之株，待收獲時即作爲種薯，種薯之大小以選擇中等者爲最宜（約重一兩左右），過小之種薯，則發育欠佳，產量不豐，較大則須用刀縱切成二片或三片，惟應注意每片最少須有眼二個，切斷面須塗以草木灰，以防腐爛，每畝約須種薯一百五十斤至二百斤。</p>
<p>播種期　播種期依各地之氣候及品種而不同，上海近郊一年可種二次，第一次於春季二三月間種植，六七月間，即可收獲，第二次於秋季八月中旬種植，十月下旬收獲（秋馬鈴薯採收後，貯藏以供翌年春熟種薯之用）。</p>
<p>播種法　馬鈴薯之播種法，光於畦間開一條溝，深三四寸，乃將種薯按等距離，放置於溝內，上覆泥土，畦寬以二尺，株距七八寸爲適度。</p>
<p>管理　播種後二週，可以發芽，於生育期內，行中耕二次，除去野草，莖高一尺左右時，兼行培土，不使球莖露於地面，如發現花蕾時，宜摘除之，則球華之發育自能旺盛肥碩。</p>
<p>收獲　收獲時期由品種之早晚而異，上海方面早生種於六七月間採掘，秋播者於十月下旬莖葉黃時收獲之，每畝之收獲量，肥活地約二千二百斤，瘠薄地則僅千五百斤左右云。</p>
<p>貯藏　除去薯上泥土藏於陰涼而乾燥之地，若數量較多，則用窖藏法，掘一地坑下舖稻葉，將薯堆入，上覆高業麥捍等物，冬天則不易冰凍，中央插入竹筒，以通空氣。</p>
<h3 id="c56">病虫害 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>如發現葉面上有黃色及黑褐色之病斑時，即行注意，將病株拔除而燒去之，以免傳染。如發現有半球形之小甲蟲名星　蟲，食害馬鈴薯之葉，都宜在淸早成蟲不活發時，用手補殺之。又有一種名切根蟲，食害根部，被害之株，即倒伏枯死，如發現時，則應在株旁掘殺幼蟲，或在根際撤佈硫黃粉或除蟲菊粉以滅除之。</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a Frontline Base, 14th: Japanese air forces attacked enemy ships off Okinawa Island and nearby waters at dawn on the 14th, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 14th: A dispatch from Da Fao Island states that the Nimitz Command announced the following on the 13th: On June 5th, the U.S. Third Fleet, between the Philippines and Okinawa, suffered damage to 21 ships due to a violent hurricane. These included the new battleship "Alabama," the "Indiana," the "Massachusetts," and five aircraft carriers such as the "Essex." The cruiser "Pittsburgh" lost 100 feet of its bow to the waves and is currently undergoing intensive repairs. Other damaged ships are still participating in operations. The hurricane's speed was said to be 166 to 220 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Mobile Unit Attack; Extremely Poor Skill <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Proving the Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses in the Okinawa Battle</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a Frontline Aviation Base, 14th: The enemy mobile unit, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the Okinawa battle and retreated to rear bases in the Leyte and Ulithi areas, reorganized its forces shortly after. On the morning of the 10th, it approached the Japanese mainland and launched carrier-based aircraft to attack aviation bases in the Kanto region. This mobile unit was composed primarily of the surviving escort carriers "Lexington II" and "Essex," "Independence," etc., mixed with converted carriers. However, the poor skill of their attacks was unprecedented, a concrete proof that the enemy mobile unit had been heavily struck by the Japanese forces and suffered excessive damage. Their aviation skills were also extremely poor; a large formation of 1,200 aircraft was only barely able to put on a show. Their low level of skill was exactly the same as that of the combat-bomber combined units taking off from the Okinawa base. This proves that the enemy mobile unit and naval forces in the Okinawa operation have suffered heavy losses. During the Okinawa operation, enemy aircraft repeatedly experienced forced landings due to engine problems. This shows that the enemy army, which prides itself on abundant supplies, is in an inescapable predicament in the Okinawa operation.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Squad Leader Shimada; Discusses Mainland Landing Battle; Psychological Contradictions on the Chongqing Side <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, head of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Unit, answered questions from reporters from various newspapers in this city on the "exaggerated propaganda of the enemy U.S. regarding a mainland landing battle" at the regular press conference yesterday (14th) morning. Squad Leader Shimada expressed his views as follows:</p>
<p>The enemy will transfer troops from Europe to East Asia. In terms of air force and army strength, the air force can move faster, while the army will take considerable time. The earliest a landing could be realized is after October of this year. The possibility of the enemy gathering forces in the Pacific and landing on the Chinese mainland depends on the scale of the landing. If the enemy dares to land on the mainland, it must have a huge force. Currently, the enemy's tactics are still focused on large-scale bombing of the Japanese mainland, destroying small and medium-sized cities and transportation lines. In the event the enemy lands on the mainland, the southeastern coast, such as Guangdong and Fujian, is more likely.</p>
<p>Recently, Chiang Kai-shek mentioned the landing of U.S. troops on the Chinese mainland in three speeches, claiming that the Chongqing army's self-reliant general counter-offensive must be actively supported by the United States with military and economic assistance, which he is confident can be achieved. He shows reluctance to see the realization of the U.S. military's landing, but at the same time hopes for U.S. assistance. The contradictions in his psychology are obvious.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Fierce Fighting Continues Around Balikpapan; Enemy Troops on Ternate Island Surrounded <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a Southern Front Base, 13th: The Balikpapan front has seen fierce fighting between Japanese and U.S. troops since the U.S. landing in the past 72 hours. The damage suffered by the enemy has not yet been fully determined, but it is certain that the enemy has lost a large number of tanks and artillery. Currently, fierce fighting continues in the Balikpapan hilly area and along the line connecting the second airfield on the Samarinda highway. The Japanese army has made a slight strategic retreat. The enemy has invaded the first airfield. The results achieved by the Japanese army in this land and sea battle are as follows: four enemy large destroyers sunk, six minesweepers sunk, two transport ships sunk, three landing craft sunk, fifteen aircraft shot down, and 2,200 enemy soldiers annihilated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a Southwest Pacific Base, 14th: The Japanese army is surrounding and pressuring the enemy troops who landed north of Ternate Island, further tightening the encirclement on the 12th, annihilating over 300 enemy soldiers and inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Suzhou-Shanghai Highway; Being Actively Constructed <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou, 14th: The Suzhou-Shanghai Highway has been progressing smoothly since the Suzhou and Shanghai provincial and municipal authorities began construction. All bridge and road surface engineering will be completed gradually. It is learned that the provincial government, in order to celebrate wartime achievements and facilitate wartime transportation, has instructed relevant authorities to expedite the repair of the Suzhou-Shanghai-Kunshan-Taicang-Qingpu-Anzhen highways. In addition, the load-bearing capacity of all bridge signs will be uniformly increased from 6 metric tons to 11 metric tons to meet needs. To gather collective wisdom, a meeting of relevant authorities was convened yesterday at the Construction Department. First, Director Sun of the Construction Department reported in detail: the situation of repairing various highways, the strengthening of automobile control, the collection of road maintenance fees, the maintenance of provincial highways, the recent work status of the Construction and General Engineering Office, and the adaptation of wartime measures and cooperation in various new construction plans during wartime. After discussion, key points were decided. In addition to the Suzhou-Shanghai and Kunshan-Taicang roads, which will still be handled by the Construction General Engineering Office, projects such as the Qingpu-Anzhen Road will be handled by the respective county governments. It is reported that the Construction General Engineering Office has been working overnight since receiving the order, and has already drafted a detailed plan, which has been submitted to the province for approval. Construction will begin soon, with the goal of completing it in the shortest possible time to facilitate transportation. This will be a long-term benefit, leaving a brilliant legacy for Jiangsu's construction, cooperating in the war, and adapting to wartime measures. Great expectations are placed on all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Ministry of Finance Report; Recent Policy Overview; Measures Taken to Stabilize Shanghai's Financial Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 14th: Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance met with Chinese and Japanese journalists in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 14th in the Ministry of Finance conference room and announced the following regarding the Ministry's recent policy overview:</p>
<p>In terms of finance, recently, due to the lack of cash in the market, allocation notes have emerged in Shanghai. The disadvantages are evident: discounting is prevalent, stimulating price increases and having a significant impact. In light of this, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the cessation of allocation notes' circulation and replaced them with bank drafts. However, a few banks are still issuing promissory notes excessively, causing volatility in prices in Shanghai. Recently, the Ministry has instructed the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office to revoke the licenses or severely punish some illegal banks based on the inspection results. It is believed this will stabilize prices in Shanghai to some extent.</p>
<p>Regarding salt affairs adjustment, future policies for the Salt Affairs Office will focus on adapting to reality. The former Zhonghua and Yuhua companies have been dissolved. In the future, the two parties' transportation and sales will adopt a unified system, contract out to merchants by region, and unify transportation and sales matters. The government will assist from the sidelines. The contracting work ended on June 18th and the progress is very good, with very enthusiastic investment from all parties. From July 1st, the salt tax will be increased to 3,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of civil servant compensation, the increase in civil servant salaries for the second half of the year was approved at the 74th National Defense Conference on the 12th, deciding to increase it to secure their livelihoods. The large rice ration system will also continue to be maintained.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of salary rice procurement, approximately 60,000 dan of rice is needed each month for civil servants and military police salaries. At a time when rice procurement is difficult, it is not easy to secure this amount each month. In addition to discussing procurement methods with relevant parties, a meeting of local financial authorities will be convened within the next few days to plan to collect real goods on behalf of the central government from the local real goods collection system in various provinces and cities to supplement the source of salary rice.</p>

<h3 id="e25">On Bank Drafts and Increased Currency Issuance <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, the proliferation of bank drafts in the market has been like carps crossing the river. At the same time, although the Central Bank has been trying its best to ease the cash position of banks and financial institutions, the amount of deposits that depositors can withdraw is only slightly more than before and still cannot meet legitimate needs. The first impact of the excessive issuance of bank drafts is rising prices. At the same time, when depositors need cash in excess of the amount they can withdraw, they have to discount it on the black market. In other words, it increases the unnecessary burden and suffering of the people. The authorities prohibit promissory notes but allow the issuance of bank drafts, which, in addition to creating a superior position for banks and financial institutions, can be said to have further increased the unnecessary suffering and loss of the people. Banks issue bank drafts originally to meet the needs of customers, facilitate cash payments, and make it easy to carry. However, today, banks and financial institutions issue drafts not only without being prompted by customer requests, but also with the intention of forcing customers to accept them. The only excuse is the shortage of cash, and the resulting bad consequences are credit inflation and rising prices. An analysis follows:</p>
<p>The Credit Issue of Bank Drafts: When banks issue drafts to replace cash, it has already caused prices to rise. However, promissory notes have the backing of the Central Reserve and the two monetary preparation associations. With sufficient reserves, they still cannot be compared with cash. Moreover, the quality of banks and financial institutions in Shanghai varies. Among them, there are some who operate with speculation as their business. A few bad apples are enough to harm the whole group. Therefore, in terms of the credit of bank drafts, they are inferior to promissory notes and there is a real need for restrictions. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The Issuance Issue of Bank Drafts: Promissory notes must go through exchange procedures and check the cash position before issuance, so there are still concerns when they are issued. However, it is an undeniable fact that the recent thirty-five banks and financial institutions have taken advantage of their position to excessively issue promissory notes. Moreover, since the issuance of bank drafts does not go through exchange procedures, there is no need to check the cash position. Under the guise of "withdrawal within ten days," there is no lack of daring and reckless issuance without any scruples. Therefore, since July 3rd, the cash position of banks has been tight, and prices of goods, stocks, gold, etc., have only risen and not fallen, which is not unrelated to the proliferation of bank drafts. It is detrimental to the people's livelihood and of no benefit, and there is a real need for restrictions. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The Forgery Issue of Bank Drafts: Forgery of bank drafts will inevitably cause people to suffer losses. Banks can easily detect forgery and return the drafts, but stores and individuals, except for tracing the original owner, have to recognize the loss themselves. The forgery that occurred with promissory notes in the past will definitely not disappear with the use of bank drafts, but will intensify, so there is an even greater need for restrictions. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issuance of bank drafts by banks may be beneficial to the banks themselves, but it is of no benefit to the country and the people. Currently, some banks issue bank drafts, which is even more harmful because it promotes discounting. Discounting means that banks obtain cash but do not pass it on to depositors, but instead discount it at a high price to make huge profits. The banks themselves and their employees collude with each other. Recently, withdrawing cash from banks is like climbing a ladder on a steep riverbank, motivated only by profit and unrelenting in their pursuit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the benefit of banks issuing drafts is not only that they can replace cash, so a large amount of cash can be discounted out the back door, but also that they can create credit to purchase materials. In wartime, prices are bound to rise gradually. Due to the excessive issuance of bank drafts, prices are even more likely to rise. Moreover, bank drafts do not require interest deductions. After ten days, at most, a new draft is presented and exchanged. Recently, Hwa Chi stocks have only risen and not fallen, which is due to the loose cash position and the fact that bank drafts are causing trouble. It is not surprising that a small bank issues an average of 10 million yuan in drafts per month. It is also not surprising that Hwa Chi stocks rise by 100% in a month. Due to the banks' behind-the-scenes promotion, a small bank can earn at least 10 million yuan or more per month by excessively issuing drafts. No wonder that recently some bank employees are arrogant and complacent, while other salaried employees and ordinary people are more likely to appear emaciated and struggling to survive due to the double exploitation of prices and cash shortages.</p>
<p>In conclusion, issuing bank drafts and restricting cash withdrawals are two sides of the same coin and are absolutely linked. Bank drafts cannot achieve the status of being equivalent to cash, especially in the present time when there are many banks and a shortage of supplies. The excessive issuance of bank drafts and the restriction of cash withdrawals should be strictly prohibited. Since December 1, 1943, the Central Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office has banned financial institutions from issuing long-term drafts, both to improve the financial system and to gain the trust of the people. However, at that time, the issuance of drafts was limited, and its harm was not significant. However, the authorities had already planned for a rainy day and nipped problems in the bud. Now, just over a year later, why are banks allowed to excessively issue drafts, putting themselves in a contradictory position? Do they think that a ten-day period is harmless? It should be known that the ten-day period is just a trick. When it expires, no cash is paid, but another draft is exchanged for another ten days. Repeating this cycle, what is the difference between a bank's long-term draft and a bank's short-term draft? Moreover, the extent to which the Central Bank's currency is contracted is limited or may not be able to contract, while bank drafts can take the opportunity to be issued in large quantities. Not only is the currency supply in the market only increasing, but it seems that the Central Bank's exclusive right to issue currency is also shared equally by all banks and financial institutions. Is this the phenomenon that wartime financial control should have? The harm of the Central Bank's inflated currency issuance versus the simultaneous issuance of drafts and credit expansion by various banks is obvious to anyone with intelligence. It is hoped that the financial authorities will consider this carefully. Rather than allowing various banks and financial institutions to issue drafts, it is better to increase the issuance of currency quickly, thereby eliminating the exploitation of Chinese people and reducing the burden on the people.</p>

<p>The Soviet Red Army relentlessly bombarded German positions with this kind of artillery, pouring in tremendous amounts. In contrast, the British and American way of fighting was to deploy an absolute majority of aircraft to attack Germany with the power of the air force. Most of the British and American tanks were small and not very impressive. A German officer who participated in the Battle of Leipzig said so. However, above the British and American tank formations, their air force constantly provided cover and led the way. Before the tank formations even reached a city or town, the British and American aircraft would carry out a terrifying bombing, turning both cities and villages into flattened ground. Therefore, the German army had no choice but to abandon the artillery used to deal with these small tanks and retreat in droves. As a result, many places offered no resistance at all, allowing these small tanks to rampage at will. The British and American forces also used "air trains" to constantly replenish supplies, so even if the German army completely destroyed railways and roads, it could not reduce the speed of the British and American tank formations.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Germany Lacks Repair Materials <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the damage caused by air raids, Germany's speed of repair and restoration was initially truly astonishing. Major damage that normally took a month to repair could be repaired perfectly in Germany in just two or three hours, restoring it to its original state. When an iron bridge was bombed and fell into the river, it was soon lifted by a huge crane and re-erected on the river in its original form within a few hours. The same was true for factories, railways, and buildings. However, since last summer, the air raids by British and American aircraft have become increasingly frequent, and the materials for repair have gradually become scarce. As a result, the speed of restoration has decreased day by day, and finally, the railway network has been cut off inch by inch. In addition, due to the loss of Romania, there was a shortage of gasoline for the roads running across the country, making it difficult to make full use of them. As a result, the mobility, which can be called the lifeblood of internal operations, was completely lost. Moreover, high-speed highways in Germany were so large and solid that it seemed impossible to destroy them in a short time. As a result, once the battlefield moved to the country, these highways were used by the enemy to fully exert their mobility. "These roads are really good!" Soviet mechanized units moving along these modern highways often exclaimed. Today, Germany has become a ruin, and only these highways remain to show the achievements of German culture.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Germany's Advantages <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Although Germany was ultimately defeated, there are many things to learn from Germany. For example, the planning based on its scientific talent is one of them. The thorough mobilization of its citizens is also commendable. In order to compensate for the huge loss of manpower at the front, even housewives were mobilized, even mothers with children, numbering more than two million. As a result, the German military authorities were able to draw five million troops from the factories to the front. Those who received fresh troops were also properly arranged, with no one being redundant or working in a job that did not suit their abilities. Even in the early stages, production did not decline due to the replacement of male and female workers. The authorities had long considered the trivial household chores of housewives, and their working hours were always based on a three- or four-shift system, striving to reduce rest time. Later, as air raids intensified and more factory equipment was destroyed, and the repair work did not progress as well as expected, many people lost their jobs. As a result, some people were demobilized or transferred to work in other important factories. This measure proceeded smoothly and fairly until the end.</p>
<p>Especially in the food policy, its planning was carried out without regret, and everything was implemented with a perfect coupon system. As long as there was a ration card, bread, butter, sugar, vegetables, meat, etc. could be purchased, and the quantity did not change until the end.

<p>The municipal government believes that, at the beginning of the implementation of emergency measures for rice and grain and the opening of rice transportation, there is a concern that a small number of merchants may take the opportunity to hoard, and that local competent authorities may restrict circulation under the pretext of maintaining local food supplies. Therefore, it has separately informed the relevant agencies to effectively prevent such incidents. Now, in order to ensure that the emergency measures obtain thorough results, it has ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to strictly investigate and prohibit merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard and restricting circulation under various pretexts, in order to eliminate malpractices and emphasize laws and orders. After receiving the order, the bureau has ordered the Economic Security Section and the Economic Police Corps to strictly comply, mobilizing all economic police to conduct thorough investigations and severely crack down on the above-mentioned illegal activities, and hopes that citizens will cooperate in reporting them.</p>

<p>In order to curb the bad practice of discounting and eliminate the panic of cash shortage, the Central Reserve Bank, after active discussions and research, has determined concrete measures to regulate cash and is gradually implementing them. All difficulties will be solved step by step. In addition to issuing new 10,000 yuan notes from yesterday (14th), it is now also actively promoting the circulation of special Central Reserve Bank drafts based on the key points of regulating cash that were decided at a recent meeting with banks and financial institutions. Two types of special drafts, 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan, will be implemented immediately, canceling the horizontal lines and using them as cash in circulation, and can also be used for transfers. Other special drafts of 500,000 yuan and 1,000,000 yuan can be used for daily cash positions and can supplement exchange positions. As for the 10,000 yuan special draft, the horizontal lines will also be canceled and used as cash in circulation. According to the person in charge of the Central Reserve Bank, after the implementation of this method, the cash panic in the market can be resolved immediately, and there will never be a recurrence of past phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Anxious About Scholarship Funds, Urging Wealthy People to Donate More <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and everyone's spirits seem to be a little depressed, which has affected our fundraising for scholarship funds. There are only a few people who have recognized the donations, which makes us, especially the thousands of poor students who are directly affected, very anxious. According to our budget, we should have an average of more than 10 million yuan in donations every day, and we can raise 300 million yuan in a month. However, the recent situation is that we have only received 2-3 million yuan a day in the past 8-9 days, or even only 300,000-400,000 yuan, which is too pitiful! In such a large city as Shanghai, there are wealthy people as numerous as the hairs on an ox, but everyone is so indifferent to this social welfare project of nurturing talents for the country, which is too cruel.</p>
<p>Dear readers: In today's era, we must see life more clearly. My property is given to me by the public, and it is temporary rather than permanent. We bring nothing with us when we are born, and we take nothing with us when we die. If we can understand this, we should have a great epiphany, turn private into public, create benefits for the public, and create living Buddhas for everyone, which is for ourselves and for our descendants to accumulate virtue, and we will be rewarded with good in the future and benefit endlessly. So, what is the value of donating a little scholarship money? Thinking of the thousands of poor students, it is indeed the most meaningful wish. The ancients said, "Accumulating wealth is not as good as accumulating virtue." I urge the wealthy people in Shanghai to have a good thought. The merit is immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e51">A General Discussion of Potatoes <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Wu</p>
<p>At a time when rice is scarce and the consumption of mixed grains is being promoted, it is necessary to introduce the types of mixed grains and increase their production. The potato is one type of mixed grain. This article provides a general overview of its varieties, characteristics, and cultivation methods, and is offered for the reference of those concerned about the mixed grain issue. The author, Mr. Zhao, is the Director of the Experimental Farm at the Agricultural College of St. John's University. This is also introduced here.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities in our country, agricultural products have often been harvested poorly, and the supply of staple foods such as rice and wheat is insufficient. Therefore, the cultivation of mixed grain crops has been promoted to supplement the shortfall. Among these, the potato, in particular, is a new contribution among the mixed grains, and its cultivation area is widespread, covering almost the entire globe. As early as the 18th century, Western countries had already advocated planting it, but because Westerners preferred wheat as a staple food and had become accustomed to it, it could not be popularized. However, at the end of the 18th century, Europe experienced a food crisis, and efforts were made to promote the widespread planting of potatoes. By the beginning of the 19th century, cultivation techniques had improved, and yields were abundant, making it one of the main agricultural products. The edible part of the potato is the underground stem, and the fruits are plump and rich in starch and sugar. In addition to being used as a staple food, it can be used as an industrial raw material (such as for extracting starch and alcohol). Potatoes are well-suited to the climate and soil conditions of various regions. If they are rotated with other crops, they can improve the soil and increase productivity.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Characteristics <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The potato is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family. It originates in the highlands of Chile and Peru in South America. Its characteristics are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Roots – These are fibrous roots that penetrate the soil to a depth of about two feet, but they are not very developed.</p>
<p>Stems – These are divided into above-ground stems and underground stems. The above-ground stems bear leaves and carry out photosynthesis, and they are two to three feet tall. The underground stems are called stolons, and their tips develop and swell to form tubers, which are oval or kidney-shaped and rich in starch and sugar. They can be cooked and eaten or used as an industrial raw material. The outer skin is white-yellow or light red, and the skin has depressions, commonly called eyes, which contain dormant buds. After planting, these buds develop and grow.</p>
<p>Leaves – These are alternate pinnate compound leaves with long petioles. The leaf shape is nearly round, and the color is dark green, soft, and juicy.</p>
<p>Flowers – The pistil and corolla are both divided into five petals, and the petals are connected in a tubular shape, forming a cyme inflorescence. The flower colors include pale white-purple and light yellow, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Fruits – These are round or oblate, very small, and contain seeds that can be used for propagation. However, their heredity is very poor, so except for use in breeding new varieties, they are rarely used for propagation.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Uses <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Potatoes are a staple food in European and American countries, or used as vegetables and livestock feed. In our country, they are often used as a supplementary food. They can also be mixed with flour to make bread, and can be used as raw materials for the manufacture of starch and alcohol. The residue can also be used as feed for pigs.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Varieties <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>There are many varieties of potatoes. More than two thousand varieties have already been discovered, and new ones are invented every year. If classified by use, there are edible varieties, industrial varieties, and mixed-use varieties. If classified by maturity period, there are early-maturing, mid-maturing, and late-maturing varieties. These are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Edible varieties: These are delicious and have a fine texture. They mature relatively early, and the tubers are medium in size, oblong, with smooth skin and few eyes. The flesh is white with a yellowish tint. They store well, but because they are planted early, the yield is not very abundant, so they are suitable for planting in gardens.</p>
<p>(B) Industrial varieties: These are used for extracting starch and manufacturing alcohol, and are also used for feeding livestock. They are high-yielding, contain a lot of starch, store well, and are disease-resistant. The tubers are large, so this type can be used when planting on a large scale.</p>
<p>(C) Mixed-use varieties: These potatoes contain a lot of starch and can be used as an industrial raw material. They also taste good, so they are the most commonly planted.</p>
<p>According to German test results, the earliness or lateness of the growing season is closely related to the amount of yield. Early-maturing varieties take 109 days from planting to maturity, and yield 2,000 catties per mu, with a starch content of 14.7%. Late-maturing varieties take 132 days to mature, and yield 4,000 catties per mu, with a starch content of 18.8%. Late-maturing varieties have a longer growing season, so the yield is abundant, the starch content is high, and the disease resistance is strong, so they are better than early-maturing varieties.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Cultivation Methods <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Climate: Potatoes prefer a cool and refreshing climate, and can be cultivated in both the north and south of China, but they grow best in a temperate climate, with high yields. During the growing season, they cannot tolerate extreme heat or drought, and too much rainfall can easily lead to root rot, so it is not very suitable.</p>
<p>Soil: The soil quality is not limited. Potatoes can be planted in any barren soil, newly reclaimed land, or dry and loose soil, but to obtain abundant yields and good quality, it is necessary to choose loose, well-drained, fertile sandy loam or clay loam. It is also important to pay attention to good drainage.</p>
<p>Fertilization: Potatoes require a large amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, especially potassium. About 2,000 catties of decomposed compost, 30 catties of superphosphate of lime, 20 catties of potassium sulfate, or 100 catties of wood ash should be used per mu. These should be applied as a base fertilizer once before planting. For nitrogen fertilizer, about 20 catties of ammonium sulfate or 20 dan of human manure should be applied after planting.</p>
<p>Land Preparation: Before planting potatoes, the land must be plowed to loosen the soil so that the tubers can develop fully. If it is fallow land, it should be deeply plowed before winter freezing to freeze the eggs of germs and pests. For land preparation, high ridges should be used in low-lying areas with poor drainage, and flat ridges can be used in dry areas.</p>
<p>Seed Potatoes: Whether or not the selection of tubers is appropriate can affect the yield. During the potato growing season, select strong and disease-free plants in advance, and use them as seed potatoes at harvest time. The size of the seed potatoes should be moderate (about one liang in weight). Seed potatoes that are too small will not develop well and will not produce a good yield. Larger ones must be cut lengthwise into two or three pieces, but care should be taken to ensure that each piece has at least two eyes. The cut surface must be coated with wood ash to prevent rot. About 150 to 200 catties of seed potatoes are required per mu.</p>
<p>Planting Time: The planting time varies depending on the climate and variety in each region. In the suburbs of Shanghai, potatoes can be planted twice a year. The first time is in the spring, between February and March, and they can be harvested between June and July. The second time is in the autumn, in mid-August, and they are harvested in late October (the autumn potatoes are harvested and stored for use as seed potatoes for the following spring).</p>
<p>Planting Method: For the potato planting method, simply open a trench between the ridges, three to four inches deep. Then, place the seed potatoes in the trench at equal distances and cover them with soil. The width of the ridges should be two feet, and the plant spacing should be seven to eight inches.</p>
<p>Management: Potatoes can germinate two weeks after planting. During the growing season, cultivate twice to remove weeds. When the stems are about one foot tall, hill the soil to prevent the tubers from being exposed to the ground. If flower buds are found, they should be removed to ensure that the development of the tubers is vigorous and plump.</p>
<p>Harvest: The harvest time varies depending on the earliness or lateness of the variety. In Shanghai, early-maturing varieties are harvested in June and July, and autumn-sown varieties are harvested in late October when the stems and leaves turn yellow. The yield per mu is about 2,200 catties in fertile land and only about 1,500 catties in barren land.</p>
<p>Storage: Remove the soil from the potatoes and store them in a cool, dry place. If the quantity is large, use a cellar storage method. Dig a pit, cover the bottom with rice straw, pile the potatoes in, and cover them with wheat stalks. In winter, this will prevent them from freezing easily. Insert bamboo tubes into the center to allow air to circulate.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Pests and Diseases <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>If yellow and dark brown spots are found on the leaf surface, pay attention and remove the diseased plants and burn them to prevent infection. If semi-spherical small beetles called  beetles are found eating the leaves of the potatoes, they should be killed by hand in the early morning when the adult beetles are not active. There is also a kind of cutworm that eats the roots. The affected plants will fall over and die. If they are found, the larvae should be dug up and killed near the plants, or sulfur powder or pyrethrum powder should be sprinkled around the roots to kill them.</p>
