<h3>日大本營昨發表馬尼剌守軍奮戰那斯克布東方敵傘兵降落</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日下午四時發表：敵軍一部，三日傍晚自北方侵入馬尼刺市一角，該方面日軍，刻正據守市內外要衝奮戰邀擊中。</p>
<p>菲律賓前線日軍某基地六日中央社電　敵軍一部戰車隊，三日傍晚侵入馬尼刺市北都之一角，與此同時，敵空挺部隊之一部，更於馬尼刺市北部卡格廂地方前進，刻下馬尼刺市內之日軍部隊，正於市內各要路配置兵力，並固守馬尼刺東方高地一帶之堅固陣地，與侵入馬尼刺之敵軍在該市內外展開激戰中。敵軍此次侵入馬尼刺後，已深入日軍最後準備之持久作戰陣地，經山下大將指揮下之日軍精銳，今後將繼續展開其本格之出血作戰。</p>
<p>菲島前紅六日中央社電　呂宋南部之敵軍，爲增強兵力，四日上午以七十架左右運輸機，滿載降落兵隊，到那斯克布東方附近降落。降上</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　麥克沃塞司令部五日晨發表：美軍一部已攻入馬尼刺市內，並傳，最初突入部隊爲自仁牙因方面南下之美軍第一師團。</p>
<h3>呂宋戰況槪述</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　呂宋島方面之敵軍兵力，綜計仁牙因灣登陸之七八師團及一月三十日自蘇比格灣岸登陸之第八軍兩師團，三十一日於馬尼刺灣西南方那斯克布登陸之一部兵力，似已達十師團之衆。敵軍於仁牙因灣登陸後，以其主力一舉席捲呂宋中央平原，似有直迫馬尼刺之勢，然敵軍登陸後，因遭日軍山下兵團之肉捕衝殺作戰，其南下攻勢頗受拘束，敵登陸軍之主力，以第一軍之三師團在仁牙因東岸地區，又以二師團兵力在中央平原東山地攻擊日軍陣地，以第十四軍之兩師團自中央平原地帶南下，此南下部隊漸近克拉克地區時，這克拉克西方山地地帶構築堅陣之日軍猛烈抵抗，至此敵軍復分別於三十日自蘇比格灣，三十一日於那斯克布以新兵力再行新登陸，一面牽制日軍，響應南下部隊，採取衝迫馬尼刺之戰略。又那斯克布之敵登陸部隊，在巴坦加斯之山地地帶遭日軍猛攻，致使進擊受阻，故三日於馬尼刺南方約五十五公里達蓋台附近降落約一聯隊兵力之空挺部隊，以謀打開那斯克布之進路，同時，中央平原南下部隊之一部，自聖法南多附近迂迴，進入無日軍抵抗地帶。三日敵軍以戰車十數輛組成機甲部隊，其一部經阿嘎特（馬尼刺北方三十五公里）附近，逐漸突入馬尼刺市之一角，日山下兵團即以獨特之肉搏攻擊戰術，予敵以重創，同時，日軍主力復於仁牙因東岸，以及呂宋中央平原東側縱形山地地帶，馬尼刺東方山地等處，分別形成堅固之邀擊陣地，目下正嚴密監視敵軍作戰之推移中。當大東亞戰爭之初期，日軍在菲律賓戡定作戰時，敵美非軍立即拋棄馬尼刺市，以其主力據守考列基多要塞，企圖抵抗日軍，由此可知，馬尼刺市本身無論在軍事上，戰略上，均無一顧之價值。攻略馬尼刺，固爲美重在瓜達加納爾島開始反攻以來之口號，然其目的僅在聊使美國人民感覺自慰滿足而已，於現下戰局階段，以日軍而言，已無重視此等宣傳價值之必要。日軍邀擊敵軍，使敵人力資源負重大犧牲，而自投陷阱，此爲日山下兵團在戰略上所負之使命，敵軍急於佔取馬尼刺，乃沿平原地帶深入日軍陣地，然此正爲山下兵團所企求者。敵軍攻佔馬尼刺後，勢將作　爲宣傳，宣傳已制壓整個呂宋，但日軍作戰軍使侖，乃在予敵以重創，故一都市，一地點之得失，並不足介意，日軍刻於馬尼刺中央平原東側山地，克拉克西方山地及馬尼刺東方山地，構築廣大縱深陣地，繼續活躍，故今後日軍之奮戰，吾人寄與極大期待。</p>
<h3>滿萬壽節儀式隆重</h3>

<h3>揚州觀光記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者澹明</p>
<p>揚州自古即爲大江之都，所以至今設有江都縣。凡讀過近古史的，雖都可以知道她過去的繁華，乃是在中部中國首屈一指的勝地。然而我們今日到這裏來，舉凡耳目所及，恐怕僅能咀嚼歷史的餘　而已。</p>
<p>揚州受着戰爭的刦運，道還是二三百年前的事，凡是讀過揚州十日記的人，誰都能知道的。然而在這一次戰爭中，她卻完全沒有受到摧殘，當她中日人民間的友誼也很好。自從第二方面軍隨同孫總司令移防到此之後，蘇北綏靖主任公署處設在揚州，因此揚州便　然成爲該特別行政廳的首府，從其政治意味上說，愈覺其所佔地位之重要了。</p>
<p>軍政</p>
<p>現在的蘇北綏靖主任公署，是兼管轄境之一般民政的，所以有政務廳的設立。政務廳下分爲六處：即民政，財政，建設，敎育，警保與宣傳。至於其轄境也有十五縣：即江都，儀徵，高郵，寳應，鹽城，阜寧，泰縣，興化，靖江，如　，南通，海門，啓東，東台，與海安等，共設有三個行政警察專員，一駐江都，一駐南通，一駐泰縣。第二方面軍開來之後，各縣行政與建設聞將有新的推進，尤其對過去質量俱差的駐軍，亦將加以整理，今仍被保留駐於蘇北境內者，僅有第　軍長顏秀五所率之　師。還有　個獨立舞，至於第二方面軍呢，據說也有　　萬人，包括第　第　軍。另有　個獨立師，和　個特務團。現在第二方面軍，大隊都在　　一帶，在揚州駐紮的有　個特務團，而口師則在泰縣。</p>
<p>過去蘇北的駐軍紀律不十分好，因此造成了其匪橫行的機會，自從第二方面軍開到後，他們現在正規劃着各縣淸剿與防守的計劃，然而目前仍還是遊匪充斥，舉例以言，譬如拿揚州來說，全縣雖共有九區，可是第八第九兩區的行政，事實上就無法推動。被稱爲揚州名勝的瘦西湖，至今遊客也不能越過平山堂，所以治安的確保還要期待着孫總司令的勢力。</p>
<p>講到蘇北的行政，以前腐敗的地方很多，有些縣長是拿錢買的，現在好得許多，但是據說請客送禮與　人的關設還所不免，更有自特精通日語而趾高氣揚不受節制的。現在孫氏已下決心要把蘇北整理好，也許不久或有斷然的人事革新吧！</p>
<p>民生</p>
<p>在揚州雖僅有四五天，可是記者已深深地感到這裏生活的優閒與舒適。單拿揚州居民的日常生活來說，久所聞名的所謂「早上皮包水，晚上水包皮」的說法，早已可以證明了一部居民的偷安逸樂了。一般比較富有的揚州人，大都是懶洋洋的，尤其有些有錢人家的子弟，年宋滿三十就染上了惡嗜的乃是經常見慣的事。就拿記者來說，到了揚州以後也是每天被招待得太舒適了。尤其這裏的點心，恐怕在全中國找不出第二個地方能有它一般的精細了。不僅　的點心像包餃麪等遠勝京滬一帶，有許多甜點心也是踏破天涯無覓處的。這裏的麪以　鴨麪著名，同時吃飯時鴨也比雞名貴，這倒是一件奇特的事。</p>
<p>縣政</p>
<p>據說江都縣每年可以徵實二千數百萬石的米穀（指實行徵實之後計算），不過「徼實」僅有一個虛名，縣府還是折合黑市米價向農民徵收的。今日蘇北的賦稅仍奮由縣府徵收，所以在楊州做　長，向稱優缺，現在不知怎樣。就拿縣府的房屋來說，遠較今日孫良誠氏所主持的蘇北綏帮主任公署來得堂　。縣政府的負責人，也不容易見面。聽說現任縣長蔣　東講得一口好日語，大槪也是一位留日的學生吧。</p>
<p>揚州的街道，其狹小的程度實堪驚人，雪後更是每天溶化，簡直泥濘得不易行走，何况積雪從不掃除。照目前情况來說，如果今後不下雨也要一個月才能使這裏的街道　乾。這裏只有一條馬路，便是過去曾被稱爲柏齡路的，現在已改名爲新馬路。自從孫良誠氏率部來蘇北坐鎭後，已積極勒令縣府整理路政，據說自六圩到揚州的公路，曾於上月限令縣府在五天內完工，否則即以軍法從事，因此現在已修理完竣，而新馬路上也時見工人在工作着。</p>
<p>文化</p>
<p>這裏的教育，正和其它小城市一樣，在事變後呈萎靡狀態。中學除省中外，也有縣中（但僅有初中），一般敎員的待遇更是悽慘萬分。當記者在繽江的時候，會聽說那裏已有了一個救濟辦法，即向各界捐助鉅款，對中小學敎員全體分配救濟金，不知道揚州敎育當局也曾注意到沒有？</p>
<p>在揚州出版的蘇北新報，每天祗出半大張，內容也是貧乏得很。其它文化事業更談不到，然而有一天走過敎堂街，　見揚州戲院的房屋倒是異常瑰麗，可見這裏的居民鴆於逸樂的一斑了。</p>
<p>物價</p>
<p>最後講到一般的物價，雖然米只有一萬八千元一石，猪肉也只有三百五十元一斤，但仍舊不比鎭江和南京低。因爲其它百物較貴，像澡堂，則更比南京和鎭江貴得多。差不多中等的洗澡，二三個人就要三四千，如果說頂好的官洋盆，一個人便將近二三千元了。這裏居民，如果有四五口人，每個月也至少要有一萬多塊錢才能生活。各地物價的高漲，實在是一件頂危險的事。</p>
<h3>日軍水上部隊襲敵運輸船　六七艘被擊沉或燃燒</h3>
<p>菲律賓六日中央社電　日軍水上部隊，一日下午於魯邦島北方海面，攻擊敵運輸船，使其六七艘被擊沉或燃燒。</p>
<p>敵機動隊修理　艇</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　自敵美軍三日進入馬尼刺　後，呂宋戰况益形重大，目下敵軍於該島各方並進，仁牙因口及東北方高地側面，克拉克非特周圍約二師兵力，馬尼刺方面的二師兵力，蘇比格兩師，那斯克布地區的二師，全部共的十一師。敵軍幷自仁牙因灣口以至馬尼刺平原之各地連通，掌握南海制空權之空軍基地，同時在北部及中部所完成之機塲甚多，現停有飛機八百乃至一千架。又敵第三十八機動部隊，在後方基地修理受傷艦艇，有再度出現南海乃至合灣東部之勢，故菲島周圍敵軍之行動，至堪注目也。</p>
<p>波島日軍予　重創</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍基地六日中央社電　一月十八日，美軍約三千于雷伊泰島與宿霧島中間之波羅島登陸，該方面日軍即以寡兵應戰　日夜肉搏突擊，予敵重　　雖血戰旬日，但士氣仍極旺盛　　在繼續奮戰中。截止現在所判明之戰果，計炸毀山砲二，戰車五，營房三，載重汽車登陸用舟艇二，炸毀登陸用舟艇一，鹵獲重機槍四，輕機槍十，自動步槍四，彈藥九萬九千，斃敵五百餘名。</p>
<h3>日眾院昨通過決戰施策案新政治團好將產生</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日衆議院於本屆議會再開之際，即以應付苛烈戰局，强調確立强力政治體制，預期積極實施决戰施策爲基調，在全體會議預算總會及對法案之特別委員會等，均熱烈展開質問，七日全體會議，以衆議院之總意上程，關於即行決戰施策之名譽，交由翼政常任總務瀨一郞氏說明提案趣旨，全體一致通過。當說明該決議趣旨時，並嚴加指摘，應積極實現，尤其關於完成戰爭，確立決戰國民生活，軍需增產及護衛團土等之決戰施策，並强調信任完勝戰爭要諦之國民戰爭指導，活用靑壯年，以國民之立塲促醒政府。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日本此次議會中爲最大政治課題之新黨間題，於二日小磯首相答覆勝田永台氏質問後，已表現其梗槪，關於行將出現之性格，有以下各點（一）新政治團體，乃以憂國之士之欣然參加而結成者，一爲非官製而爲民意之團體。（一）非以目下成爲唯一政治結社之翼政會爲中心，而爲歡迎全國熱烈燃起政治慾之靑少年參加。（一）新政治團體之原則，非排斥其他政治結社者，故結成新黨問題，係以下列原則爲根本，而期待其迅速產生，此新政黨以何種方法以求其組織具體化，頗爲各界人士所注目。雖翼政會已決定於新團體成立後解散，然新團體非官製者，且自時局之現階段觀之，更不許僅將翼政會加以表面改組，故於國內確立必勝政治體制之外，以完遂大東亞戰爭爲最高指導目標，而與盟邦中華民國，滿洲國國民以及大東亞各民族强固提携，而必須以共同完遂戰爭及建設大東亞新秩序爲指標，方能成功。於此意義上，推進結成之新黨。其責任頗大，政府不改變從來作風，予以全面協力，其實現之成功與吾，乃視政府及政治家適應國家之危急所下之英斷與努力之程度如何而定，同時於新黨成立之動向，尤有期待。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>公益重於私利</h3>
<p>近幾年來，因爲物價高漲，大部分人　尤其薪水階級，都感到生活艱苦。可是，一部分暴利主義者，一部分貪汚份子，並未受到高物價的威脅，反而從高物價的波動中攫取了非分的暴利。因爲暴利者可以從高物價的波動中攫取暴利，所以，暴利者是在隨時製造高物價波動的機會，至少也足以助長高物價波動的氣燄</p>
<p>幾年來物價高漲的結果，社會上形成貧富格外懸殊，苦樂格外不均。薪水階級都是衣食不周，暴利階級依然盡情享受。所謂：「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」者，在目前上海的社會中，可以隨處見到這些畸形現象。</p>
<p>這種畸形現象發展的結果，人心險詐，奔競私利，道德墮落，不顧公益。不但「個人先於社會，私利重於公益」，甚至「只有個人沒有社會，只有私利沒有公益」。而與周市長在吿市民書中所提出的「公益電於私利，社會先於個人」，適成背道而馳。</p>
<p>只有個人，只有私利的人，他的人生觀却並不是不積極，他的聰明才智並不亞於別人，他的聚錢爭利的能力反而比較一般人爲高。可惜，他的積極，他的聰明才智，他的爭利能力，目標太窄，只爲自已一身一家打算，只爲十孫打算，而不爲整個社會打算，不爲整個國家打算。只須自已有了吃的穿的，想不到別人無吃無穿。這種目私自利的人愈多，這個社會就愈畸形，愈腐化。自私自利者本來隨時隨地都有，不過在目前的上海社會中，就特別的多。</p>
<p>取之於暴利手段的財富，如能用之於社會公益，尚可補過，尚可得社會諒解。如果只圖自私自利，私人享樂，則決不會得到社會諒解，國家雖無法律制裁，而社會輿論必將羣起制裁。况且，只私無公，在平時已不可能；而在目前戰時更不可能。亂世之時，混亂與不測的意外事件隨時隨地可以發生，囤積黃金固然無用，囤積物資也是無用。目前的上海，早已不是租界時代的安樂窩了。一旦有事，則覆巢之下，决無完卵。黃金决不能充饑禦寒，物資决不讓自由取用。三年前日軍攻佔香港時，五百元港幣無異廢紙。某富商家藏數十萬港帶現鈔，雇用印警看守，反而因此喪命。這都是最近的股鑑。如果說關了鐵門，雇了保鑣，就可以獨善其身，那是决無其事的。</p>
<p>自私自利者，又是最吝裔者，自己享樂，則千金一擲，公利公益，則一毛不拔。遇了綁票，因爲要性命，即肯出錢。遇了强有力者威脅，因爲怕事，也肯出錢，遇了勒索敲詐，也是無抵抗的出錢。而以道義利害解說，希望爲公益出錢，則大多退避推諉，俗語所謂「敬酒不吃，吃罰酒」，就是這般人的寫照。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們必須嚴正地指出，凡是住居於上海的人們，對於整個上海社會的安寗與福利，都有維護的責任；尤其是工商界人士，股富人士，都須發揮有錢出錢有力出力的精神，共同維護上海的安寗與福利。我們必須充分做到周市長所期待的「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」。其次，我們更須鄭重地指出，目前由於時局的進展，上海已潛伏着危機，我們必須在政府指導之下，傾其全力協同消弭危機。我們更認爲這正是幾年間投機發財的人士，補過的最好機會，也是眞正爲自己打算爲子孫打算最穩常的一着。</p>
<p>目前量急迫的一件，就是官民協力確保治安，對於擔當治安責任之軍警人員，必須充分給以足够生活的待遇。一方面帮助政府整頓稅收，一方面鼓勵軍警服務精神，過去警察的勒索行爲，大家一致口誅筆伐，現在這種行爲已經消滅，是由於當局整飭與提高待遇的結果，在我們市民的立塲，也應有協助政府與鼓勵軍警的表示。</p>
<p>論理，我們這個建議，可說是輕而易舉的。更加我們在上面已經詳細闡明個人與社會以至公利與私利的關係，料想社會人士大多數能够有動於中，贊成其事。同時，也可視爲社會人士能否轉移性格，能否做到公益重於私利的試金石。</p>

        <h1>1945.02.07</h1>
<h3>The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday That the Manila Garrison Is Fighting Valiantly; Enemy Paratroopers Landed East of Nasugbu</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 6th: A portion of the enemy forces infiltrated a corner of Manila City from the north on the evening of the 3rd. Japanese forces in that area are currently holding key points inside and outside the city, fighting fiercely to intercept the enemy.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base on the Philippine Front, 6th (Central News Agency) – A portion of the enemy's tank units infiltrated a corner of northern Manila City on the evening of the 3rd. Simultaneously, a portion of the enemy's paratrooper units advanced to the Kagojang area north of Manila City. Currently, Japanese forces in Manila City are deploying troops on key roads within the city and firmly holding strong positions in the highlands east of Manila, engaging in fierce battles inside and outside the city with the enemy forces that have infiltrated Manila. After this incursion into Manila, the enemy forces have penetrated deep into the Japanese army's final prepared defensive positions for protracted warfare. Under the command of General Yamashita, the elite Japanese forces will continue to engage in full-scale attrition warfare.</p>
<p>Former Red Island in the Philippines, 6th (Central News Agency) – To reinforce their forces in southern Luzon, the enemy used approximately 70 transport planes on the morning of the 4th, fully loaded with troops, to land near the east of Nasugbu.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – General MacArthur's headquarters announced on the morning of the 5th: A portion of the American forces has entered Manila City. It is reported that the initial assault troops were the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, which advanced south from Lingayen.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Battle Situation in Luzon</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces on Luzon Island consist of the 78th Division, which landed in Lingayen Gulf, and the two divisions of the 8th Corps, which landed on the coast of Subic Bay on January 30th, as well as a portion of forces that landed in Nasugbu southwest of Manila Bay on the 31st, which appears to total ten divisions. After landing in Lingayen Gulf, the enemy forces swept through the central plains of Luzon with their main force, seemingly poised to directly assault Manila. However, after the enemy forces landed, their southward offensive was significantly constrained due to the Japanese army's Yamashita Corps' close combat assaults. The main force of the enemy landing army, consisting of three divisions of the 1st Corps, attacked the Japanese army's positions in the eastern coastal area of Lingayen, while two divisions attacked the Japanese army's positions in the eastern mountainous area of the central plains. As the two divisions of the 14th Corps advanced south from the central plains area and approached the Clark area, they encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese army, which had constructed strong fortifications in the mountainous area west of Clark. As a result, the enemy forces separately landed new forces from Subic Bay on the 30th and from Nasugbu on the 31st, to contain the Japanese army and support the southward-bound forces, adopting a strategy of pressing towards Manila. Furthermore, the enemy landing forces in Nasugbu were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army in the mountainous area of Batangas, which impeded their advance. Therefore, on the 3rd, an airborne unit of approximately one regiment in strength was landed near Tagaytay, about 55 kilometers south of Manila, in an attempt to open up the route to Nasugbu. At the same time, a portion of the southward-bound forces in the central plains detoured from near San Fernando and entered an area without Japanese resistance. On the 3rd, the enemy forces formed an armored unit of a dozen or so tanks, and a portion of it gradually infiltrated a corner of Manila City via near Agoo (35 kilometers north of Manila). The Japanese Yamashita Corps immediately inflicted heavy damage on the enemy using its unique close-quarters combat tactics. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army formed strong interception positions on the eastern coast of Lingayen, the longitudinal mountainous area on the eastern side of the central plains of Luzon, and the mountainous area east of Manila, closely monitoring the enemy's operational movements. During the initial stages of the Greater East Asia War, when the Japanese army was conducting operations to subdue the Philippines, the enemy American and Filipino forces immediately abandoned Manila City and defended the fortress of Corregidor with their main force, attempting to resist the Japanese army. This demonstrates that Manila City itself has no value from a military or strategic standpoint. Capturing Manila has been a slogan of the United States since the counteroffensive began on Guadalcanal Island. However, its purpose is merely to bring some comfort and satisfaction to the American people. In the current phase of the war, the Japanese army no longer needs to attach importance to such propaganda value. The Japanese army is intercepting the enemy forces, causing them to suffer heavy losses in manpower and throwing themselves into a trap. This is the strategic mission of the Japanese Yamashita Corps. The enemy's eagerness to occupy Manila is causing them to penetrate deep into the Japanese army's positions along the plains area. However, this is precisely what the Yamashita Corps desires. After the enemy forces occupy Manila, they will certainly use it as propaganda, claiming to have controlled all of Luzon. However, the mission of the Japanese army is to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Therefore, the gain or loss of a city or a location is not important. The Japanese army is currently building extensive and deep defensive positions in the mountainous area on the eastern side of the central plains of Manila, the mountainous area west of Clark, and the mountainous area east of Manila, continuing to operate actively. Therefore, we have great expectations for the future valor of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Solemn Ceremony for the Emperor's Birthday</h3>

<h3>A Tourist's Notes on Yangzhou</h3>
<p>— By Tan Ming, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper</p>
<p>Yangzhou has been a major city on the Yangtze River since ancient times, and therefore still has Jiangdu County. Anyone who has read modern history knows that its past prosperity made it one of the leading scenic spots in central China. However, when we come here today, all that meets the eye can only allow us to savour the vestiges of history.</p>
<p>Yangzhou suffered from the calamities of war two or three hundred years ago. Anyone who has read the "Ten Days of Yangzhou" knows this. However, it was completely untouched in this recent war, and the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people here is also very good. Since the Second Route Army moved here with Commander-in-Chief Sun, the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office has been located in Yangzhou, so Yangzhou has naturally become the capital of this special administrative district, which highlights the importance of its political position.</p>
<p>Military and Political Affairs</p>
<p>The current Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office also manages general civil affairs in its jurisdiction, and therefore has a Political Affairs Department. The Political Affairs Department is divided into six sections: Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, Education, Police Security, and Propaganda. Its jurisdiction also covers fifteen counties: Jiangdu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yancheng, Funing, Taixian, Xinghua, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Dongtai, and Hai'an, with three Administrative Police Commissioners stationed in Jiangdu, Nantong, and Taixian. After the Second Route Army arrived, new progress is expected in the administration and construction of the counties, especially for the garrison troops, which have been poor in quality in the past, and will be reorganized. Only the Xth Division, led by Army Commander Yan Xiuwu, is still retained in the Subei region. There is also an independent unit. As for the Second Route Army, it is said to have 10,000 men, including the Xth and Xth Armies. There is also an independent division and a special service regiment. Currently, the main force of the Second Route Army is concentrated around the X area. A special service regiment is stationed in Yangzhou, while the Xth Division is in Taixian.</p>
<p>In the past, the discipline of the garrison troops in Subei was not very good, which created opportunities for bandits to run rampant. Since the Second Route Army arrived, they are now planning a comprehensive suppression and defense plan for each county. However, wandering bandits are still rampant. For example, in Yangzhou, although the county has nine districts, the administration of the eighth and ninth districts is effectively impossible. The Slender West Lake, known as a scenic spot in Yangzhou, cannot be accessed beyond Ping Shan Tang by tourists, so the guarantee of security still relies on Commander-in-Chief Sun's forces.</p>
<p>Speaking of the administration of Subei, there were many corrupt practices in the past. Some county magistrates bought their positions with money. Things are much better now, but it is said that banquets, gifts, and personal connections are still unavoidable. There are even those who are particularly proficient in Japanese and act arrogantly and unrestrainedly. Now Sun has decided to put Subei in order, and perhaps there will be drastic personnel changes soon!</p>
<p>People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Although I have only been in Yangzhou for four or five days, I have deeply felt the leisure and comfort of life here. Taking the daily life of Yangzhou residents as an example, the well-known saying "Skin wrapped in water in the morning, water wrapped in skin in the evening" has long proven the life of ease and comfort of some residents. Most of the wealthier people in Yangzhou are lazy, especially the sons of some wealthy families, who often develop bad habits as early as the age of thirty. As for me, I have been treated too comfortably every day since I arrived in Yangzhou. Especially the snacks here, I am afraid that there is no other place in China that can match their delicacy. Not only are the snacks and dumplings far superior to those in Beijing and Shanghai, but many of the sweet snacks are also unmatched anywhere else. The noodles here are famous for duck noodles, and ducks are more expensive than chickens when eating, which is a unique phenomenon.</p>
<p>County Administration</p>
<p>It is said that Jiangdu County can collect more than two million shi of rice annually (calculated after the implementation of actual collection). However, "collection of actual goods" is only a nominal, and the county government still collects from farmers at the black market price of rice. Today, taxes in Subei are still collected by the county government, so being a magistrate in Yangzhou has always been a coveted position. I don't know how it is now. Taking the county government's buildings as an example, they are much grander than the current Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office presided over by Sun Liangcheng. It is also not easy to meet the person in charge of the county government. It is said that the current county magistrate, Jiang X, speaks excellent Japanese and is probably a student who studied in Japan.</p>
<p>The narrowness of the streets in Yangzhou is truly astonishing. After the snow, they melt every day, making them difficult to walk on, and the snow is never cleared. As it stands, it will take a month for the streets to dry up even if it doesn't rain. There is only one road here, which was once called Boling Road and is now renamed Xinma Road. Since Sun Liangcheng and his troops came to Subei, they have actively ordered the county government to improve the road administration. It is said that the highway from Liuwei to Yangzhou was ordered to be completed by the county government within five days last month, otherwise, military law would be enforced. Therefore, it has now been repaired, and workers are often seen working on Xinma Road.</p>
<p>Culture</p>
<p>Education here, like in other small cities, is in a state of decline after the incident. In addition to the provincial high school, there is also a county high school (but only a junior high school). The salaries of general teachers are even more miserable. When I was in Binjiang, I heard that there was already a relief plan there, which was to donate a large sum of money from all walks of life and distribute relief funds to all primary and secondary school teachers. I don't know if the Yangzhou education authorities have paid attention to this?</p>
<p>The Subei New News, published in Yangzhou, is only half a large sheet per day, and the content is also very poor. Other cultural undertakings are even less to be mentioned. However, one day I passed by Church Street and saw that the building of the Yangzhou Theater was unusually magnificent, which shows the residents' indulgence in ease and pleasure.</p>
<p>Prices</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of general prices, although rice is only 18,000 yuan per shi and pork is only 350 yuan per catty, they are still not lower than in Zhenjiang and Nanjing. Because other goods are more expensive. For example, bathhouses are much more expensive than in Nanjing and Zhenjiang. For a medium bath, two or three people cost three to four thousand yuan. A top-notch official-style basin costs nearly two to three thousand yuan per person. If there are four or five people in a family here, they need at least more than ten thousand yuan a month to live. The rise in prices everywhere is really a very dangerous thing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Forces Attack Enemy Transport Ships; Six or Seven Ships Sunk or Burned</h3>
<p>Philippines, 6th (Central News Agency) – On the afternoon of the 1st, Japanese naval forces attacked enemy transport ships on the sea north of Lubang Island, causing six or seven of them to be sunk or burned.</p>
<p>Enemy Task Force Repairs Ships</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy American forces entered Manila on the 3rd, the battle situation in Luzon has become increasingly critical. Currently, the enemy forces are advancing in all directions on the island: approximately two divisions near the Lingayen mouth and the northeastern highlands, around Clark Field, two divisions in the Manila area, two divisions in Subic, and two divisions in the Nasugbu area, totaling eleven divisions. The enemy forces are also connecting the areas from the mouth of Lingayen Gulf to the plains of Manila, controlling air bases in the South Sea. Many airfields have been completed in the north and central areas of the island, currently housing 800 to 1,000 aircraft. Furthermore, the enemy's 38th Task Force is repairing damaged ships in the rear bases and has the potential to reappear in the South Sea and even eastern Taiwan. Therefore, the movements of the enemy forces around the Philippines are highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Inflict Heavy Damage on Enemy on Bohol Island</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base on the Philippine Front, 6th (Central News Agency) – On January 18th, approximately 3,000 American troops landed on Bohol Island, located between Leyte Island and Cebu Island. The Japanese forces in that area immediately responded with outnumbered troops, engaging in close combat assaults day and night, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Although they have been fighting bloody battles for ten days, their morale is still extremely high and they are continuing to fight valiantly. The confirmed results of the battle so far include: destroying two mountain guns, five tanks, three barracks, two heavy trucks and landing craft, destroying one landing craft, capturing four heavy machine guns, ten light machine guns, four automatic rifles, 99,000 rounds of ammunition, and killing more than 500 enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Passed Resolution on Wartime Measures Yesterday; New Political Group to Be Established</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – At the reopening of the current session of the Japanese House of Representatives, in response to the severe war situation, emphasis was placed on establishing a strong political system, and based on the expectation of actively implementing wartime measures, questions were vigorously raised in the plenary session, the general budget committee, and the special committee on bills. At the plenary session on the 7th, as the overall intention of the House of Representatives, the honor of immediately implementing wartime measures was entrusted to Iichiro Se, Director of the Wing Political Standing Committee, to explain the purpose of the proposal, which was unanimously passed. When explaining the purpose of the resolution, it was also strongly criticized that it should be actively implemented, especially regarding the completion of the war, establishing a wartime national life, increasing military production, and the local defense corps, and emphasized trust in the national war guidance for winning the war, utilizing the young generation, and urging the government to act from the standpoint of the people.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The issue of the new party, which is the biggest political issue in this session of the Japanese Diet, has been outlined after Prime Minister Koiso answered Mr. Nagata Katsuta's question on the 2nd. Regarding the characteristics of the upcoming party, there are the following points: (1) The new political group will be formed by the willing participation of patriots and will be a non-governmental, people's group. (2) It will not be centered on the Wing Political Association, which is currently the only political organization, but will welcome the participation of young people across the country who are passionately pursuing political desires. (3) The principle of the new political group is not to exclude other political organizations. Therefore, the issue of forming a new party is based on the following principles and is expected to be established quickly. What methods this new party will use to achieve its organizational structure has attracted the attention of various sectors. Although the Wing Political Association has decided to dissolve after the establishment of the new group, the new group is not government-sponsored, and from the current stage of the situation, it is not permissible to simply reorganize the Wing Political Association on the surface. Therefore, in addition to establishing a political system that is sure to win within the country, the highest guiding goal is to complete the Greater East Asia War, strengthen cooperation with the citizens of the allied Republic of China and Manchuria, as well as the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, and take the completion of the war and the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia as the guiding principle to succeed. In this sense, the responsibility for promoting the formation of the new party is great. The government should not change its past practices and give full cooperation. Whether its realization is successful depends on the extent of the government's and politicians' decisive judgments and efforts to adapt to the national crisis. At the same time, there is great anticipation for the movement to establish the new party.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Public Interest Is More Important Than Private Interest</h3>
<p>In recent years, because of high prices, most people, especially those on salaries, have found life difficult. However, some profiteers and some corrupt officials have not been threatened by high prices. Instead, they have seized unfair profits from the volatility of high prices. Because profiteers can seize huge profits from the volatility of high prices, they are creating opportunities for high prices to fluctuate at any time, or at least they are helping to fuel the volatility of high prices.</p>
<p>As a result of high prices in recent years, the gap between rich and poor in society has widened, and the disparity in happiness and suffering has become even greater. Salaried people are struggling to make ends meet, while profiteers continue to enjoy themselves to the fullest. The saying, "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot; along the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death," can be seen everywhere in the current society of Shanghai.</p>
<p>As a result of this abnormal phenomenon, people's hearts are treacherous, they are competing for private gain, morality has declined, and public interest is disregarded. Not only is "the individual before society, private interest more important than public interest," but even "there is only the individual, no society; only private interest, no public interest." This is contrary to what Mayor Zhou proposed in his letter to the citizens: "Public interest is more important than private interest, society is before the individual."</p>
<p>A person who only cares about himself and private interests does not necessarily lack ambition. His intelligence and talent are not inferior to others, and his ability to accumulate wealth and compete for profit is higher than average. Unfortunately, his ambition, intelligence, and ability to compete for profit are too narrowly focused, only for himself and his family, only for his descendants, but not for the whole society, not for the whole country. As long as he has enough to eat and wear, he does not think about others who have nothing to eat and wear. The more selfish people there are, the more abnormal and corrupt the society becomes. Selfish people have always existed, but there are especially many of them in the current society of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wealth obtained through profiteering can still be redeemed and understood by society if it is used for public welfare. But if you only seek selfishness, personal enjoyment, then you will never get the understanding of society. Even if the country has no laws to punish you, public opinion will surely rise up to punish you. Moreover, only being private and not public is impossible at any time. It is even more impossible in the current wartime. In times of chaos, chaotic and unforeseen events can happen at any time. Hoarding gold is useless, and hoarding goods is also useless. The Shanghai of today is no longer the safe haven of the concession era. Once something happens, there will be no intact eggs under an overturned nest. Gold cannot satisfy hunger or keep you warm, and goods will not be available for free use. When the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong three years ago, 500 Hong Kong dollars were as good as waste paper. A wealthy merchant hid hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong dollars in cash and hired Indian guards to watch over them, but instead lost his life. These are all recent lessons. If you say that you can close the iron gate and hire bodyguards to be safe, that is definitely not the case.</p>
<p>Selfish people are also the most stingy. They will spend a fortune on their own enjoyment, but will not contribute a penny to public welfare. When they are kidnapped, they are willing to pay because they want to save their lives. When they are threatened by powerful people, they are also willing to pay because they are afraid of trouble. When they are blackmailed, they also pay without resistance. But when you explain the benefits of morality and ask them to donate money for public welfare, most of them retreat and make excuses. As the saying goes, "If you don't drink a toast, you'll have to drink a penalty drink." That's what these people are like.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we must solemnly point out that all people living in Shanghai have a responsibility to maintain the security and welfare of the entire Shanghai society. In particular, people in the business community and wealthy people must exert the spirit of contributing money and effort to jointly maintain the security and welfare of Shanghai. We must fully achieve what Mayor Zhou expects: "Public interest is more important than private interest, society is before the individual." Secondly, we must also solemnly point out that due to the progress of the current situation, Shanghai has potential crises, and we must do our best under the guidance of the government to eliminate the crises. We also believe that this is the best opportunity for those who have made fortunes through speculation in recent years to make amends, and it is also the most stable move to truly plan for themselves and their descendants.</p>
<p>One urgent matter at the moment is to ensure public security with the cooperation of officials and civilians. We must fully provide the military and police personnel who are responsible for public security with sufficient living wages. On the one hand, we must help the government to rectify tax collection, and on the other hand, we must encourage the military and police to provide better service. The extortion of the police in the past was unanimously condemned, but this behavior has been eliminated due to the authorities' rectification and increase in treatment. From the standpoint of our citizens, we should also show our assistance to the government and encouragement to the military and police.</p>
<p>In theory, our suggestion can be said to be easy to do. Moreover, we have explained in detail above the relationship between the individual and society, as well as between public interest and private interest. We expect that most members of society can be moved and agree with this. At the same time, it can also be seen as a touchstone for whether members of society can change their character and achieve public interest over private interest.</p>
<h3>Temporary Measures for Punishing Acts Impairing the Supply and Demand of Goods in the Capital Promulgated by the National Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The National Government, in an order dated February 6th, hereby enacts and promulgates the Temporary Measures for Punishing Acts Impairing the Supply and Demand of Essential Goods in the Capital. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – To thoroughly suppress commodity prices in the capital, the central authorities have established the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee. This committee will initially focus on eight essential goods in the capital city area: rice, firewood, salt, oil, pork, chicken, duck, and fish. Adhering to the principle of promptly addressing and eliminating harm, and with a spirit of close supervision, correction, and enforcement, it aims to thoroughly achieve the goals of facilitating supply and suppressing commodity prices. Although the implementation of these measures has been brief, the supply of rice, firewood, and other commodities in the capital city area has indeed transitioned from blocked to open, and from open to smooth. Consequently, market prices have moved from high to stable, achieving significant and expected results. Henceforth, anyone who uses illegal means to impair the supply and demand of the aforementioned eight essential goods, regardless of their identity, will be prosecuted under military law. To implement its determination to suppress commodity prices, and to achieve practical results in the short term, the National Government authorities have also formulated and promulgated Temporary Measures for Punishing Acts Impairing the Supply and Demand of Essential Goods in the Capital. The original text of these temporary measures is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Article 1: Any cases involving the use of various means to impair the supply and demand of the eight essential goods (rice, firewood, salt, oil, vegetables, meat, chicken, duck, and fish), regardless of the perpetrator's identity, may be under the jurisdiction of the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee for trial and sentencing.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Military Law Section of the Capital Commodity Price Stabilization and Discipline Committee, as the trial authority, may apply the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Wartime Special Criminal Law, the Regulations for Punishing Corruption by Public Officials, the Criminal Law, and other laws for sentencing.</p>
<p>Article 3: Regarding the eight essential goods, anyone who impairs their supply and demand through violence, coercion, fraud, or other means, resulting in market shortages, even if not engaged in speculation, manipulation, or hoarding for profit, may be subject to a death sentence by special permission from the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission under wartime military orders.</p>
<p>Article 4: Anyone who, with the intention of obtaining illegal profits, illegally levies donations, or uses power, violence, coercion, fraud, or other means to extort property from the people, whether or not they are public officials, shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for ten years or more.</p>
<p>Article 5: The pronouncement of death sentences or imprisonment shall be carried out in accordance with legal procedures after approval has been obtained.</p>
<p>Article 6: These measures shall take effect from February 1, 1945.</p>
<h3>Draft Plan to Improve Railway Management</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Department of Roads and Administration of the Ministry of Construction, recognizing the increasing deterioration of railway transportation management, and in order to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities and protect the legitimate rights and interests of passengers, has instructed the Central China Railway Company to draft three proposals for improving the current state of railway management, as follows: (1) Suppress the black market trading of train tickets, (2) Crack down on the illegal activities of "black ticket touts," and (3) Prevent the loss of passengers' checked baggage, to be submitted to the Ministry for review. The Ministry is currently consulting with relevant parties on the above proposals. Yu Yizhao, Director of the Department of Roads and Administration, and Deputy Director Zhang, have made a special trip to Shanghai to inspect the actual conditions of stations in Shanghai and other places. It is reported that since the launch of the work to refresh station order, the rampant black market ticket trading has been somewhat suppressed. However, theft of passenger baggage still occurs from time to time. At the same time, some unscrupulous staff at the station take advantage of their positions to extort money before allowing passengers to verify their tickets and pass through. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this and stop it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 5th that anti-Axis forces are gathering troops east and north of Aachen, and have intensified shelling on the Saar defense line. This suggests that Eisenhower's large-scale offensive is imminent. The center of this offensive is roughly composed of the British Second and American Ninth Armies. Their operational goal is to invade Cologne and Düsseldorf, encircle the Rhineland industrial area, and then advance to the northern German plains. Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency) – A German-reported Paris dispatch states that the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force has announced that General Bradley has been reappointed as commander of the US First Army.

<h3>Seventh Batch of Special Flour to Be Distributed Soon</h3>
<p>The Flour Unified Allocation Office of the Shanghai District of the Flour Control Association, in order to meet the flour needs of various noodle product industries with the Lunar New Year approaching, has specially requested the Flour Control Association to allocate some flour to continue the seventh batch of special flour distribution during the New Year. Each shop will be allocated five bags of Grade Two flour, priced at 6,380 yuan. The distribution scope includes Pudong District, Hunan District, West Shanghai District, Zhabei District, Central District (formerly the eight districts), and Hongkou District (Yangshupu). The office has already distributed the special flour allocation certificates to the various industry associations for distribution to their member shops, who can collect the flour with the certificates. It is reported that the total number of participating households is 6,481, totaling 32,405 bags. Including: 2,635 noodle-making households, allocated 13,175 bags. 1,180 machine-made noodle businesses, allocated 5,900 bags. 1,407 pastry and fried food businesses, allocated 7,035 bags. 253 confectionery businesses, allocated 1,265 bags. 329 flour businesses, allocated 1,645 bags. 415 restaurants, allocated 2,075 bags. 149 dim sum restaurants, allocated 745 bags. 80 confectionery shops, allocated 400 bags. 33 congee shops, allocated 165 bags.</p>
<h3>Rice Control Association Refreshes Personnel</h3>
<p>The Rice Control Committee, in light of the importance of rice control during wartime, is gradually improving its personnel based on the strengths and weaknesses of each staff member and their work ethic. At the end of last month, it announced the dismissal of some staff members, totaling more than thirty people, including one deputy director of the General Affairs Department and one chief of the Transportation Section of the Business Department. It is reported that the reasons for this layoff, in addition to the authorities' determination to refresh work, also include reviewing the aftermath of the case of the former secretary-general of the association, Zhou Chunyu, being derelict in his duties. However, none of those laid off were involved in any improper conduct. Furthermore, to ensure the livelihood of the laid-off staff, the association has allowed each laid-off person to continue receiving salary until May, which is more generous than the severance pay issued in previous layoffs.</p>
<h3>Municipal Baojia Office Coordinates the Collection of Baojia Fees</h3>
<p>The baojia expenses in the urban area of ​​this city, after being uniformly collected by the Municipal Police Bureau Baojia Office starting in July of last year, have become extremely urgent due to the need for funds in various baojia districts. Furthermore, special prices have increased sharply, requiring huge expenses. After several joint talks held by the Lianbao, it was proposed to increase the baojia expenses. A resolution was passed to revise the collection amount starting from January of this year, calculated at 50 yuan per attached household per month, 100 yuan per regular household, and 200 yuan per shop household (based on one room or building, with similar analogy for multiple), with a maximum of 20,000 yuan for special households. The increased funds will be determined by the heads of the district branch bureaus, together with the chairmen of each district and the head of the general lianbao, to improve the treatment of baojia personnel and promote baojia construction work. The Baojia Office has submitted the original plan to the municipal government for approval and will be implemented starting from January, and the collection of baojia expenses for January and February will begin immediately. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to the Lianbao offices in each district, informing them that the required payment certificates should be claimed from the office immediately.</p>

<h3>Economic Police Crack Down on Profiteering Stalls; Hope Citizens Will Report at Any Time</h3>
<p>The Economic Police Team of the Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the recent sharp rise in food prices, which has deeply affected people's livelihoods, especially with the Lunar New Year approaching, when small vegetable market stalls are taking the opportunity to raise prices, believes that prices cannot be suppressed without strict crackdown. Therefore, starting from the 7th of this month, thirty-four investigation teams will be stationed in various public open-air vegetable markets. Those who arbitrarily raise prices and profiteering stalls will be detained or ordered to suspend business. Those with minor circumstances will also be fined. In order to make this plan more thorough, secret ballot boxes have been set up in various small vegetable markets. It is hoped that all citizens and housewives will assist as much as possible and report at any time.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Third-Class System on Trams; Ticket Price is 15 Yuan</h3>

The third-class system on trolleybuses on all routes was abolished last year. Therefore, the fares for all trams and trolleybuses under the Municipal Urban Transportation Company will be unified from now on, and the fares for the front and rear cars and trailers will be 15 yuan each. As for the operating hours, they are still divided into two shifts as before, with the early shift from 6:30 AM to about 10:00 AM and the late shift from about 4:00 PM to 8:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Visiting Mr. Yen Hui-ching for Charity Sale to Support Education</h3>
<p>— Bo Cun, Student of St. John's University</p>
<p>Having passed Lichun (Beginning of Spring), the unexpected severe cold this year is truly unbearable. Our group of four went to visit Mr. Yen around ten in the morning. Although the weather was particularly cold, our desire to see Mr. Yen was even more fervent. After entering the gate, we informed the attendant of our purpose. We are representatives of St. John's University and hope that Mr. Yen can help with the charity market we are organizing. The attendant went inside for a while and then came out, telling us that Mr. Yen was busy with affairs and had no time to meet us, and explained that he already knew about the charity sale and had even donated on his own initiative. In fact, it was expected that Mr. Yen would be busy and have no time, as he is dedicated to serving society. However, Mr. Yen's ability to still find time amidst his busy schedule to help with this charity sale is truly admirable.</p>
<p>However, our purpose was not limited to this. We also hoped that Mr. Yen could guide us with his rich experience and inaugurate the Fan Huang Du store of our school. Therefore, we troubled the attendant again to present a letter on our behalf. In less than a few minutes, the door to the inner room opened. Unexpectedly, we met an elderly man with a kind face and a dignified bearing. He walked into the room steadily, and we stood up respectfully to pay our respects. Mr. Yen spoke in a gentle voice, making us forget the cold of the day. Mr. Yen's concern made us forget the snubs we had encountered everywhere and felt a strange comfort, as if a prodigal son had returned home and saw his loving father, filling our hearts with emotion. After Mr. Yen learned of our purpose, he enthusiastically encouraged us. Finally, he stood up calmly, and we bid farewell and left. Upon exiting the gate, we were even more reminded of Mr. Yen's noble personality.</p>
<p>Charity Market Starts Fundraising</p>
<p>Since the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao newspapers and the Men's and Women's Youth Association initiated the charity market, various schools have actively participated. Each school has enthusiastically promoted the sale of value coupons, already exceeding 20 million yuan, which is double the original target of 10 million yuan, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of the students. However, the items donated by various sectors are still insufficient. Recently, enthusiastic students have voluntarily launched a charity fundraising team, divided into small groups to go to various factories and stores to solicit donations, carrying letters of introduction and receipts bearing the names of the two newspapers and the Men's and Women's Youth Association, hoping that various factories and stores will generously help complete this charity. The donation status of various factories will be published in the two newspapers and major radio stations to ensure credibility and encourage others.</p>
<p>Donating New Year's Money to Help Students</p>
<p>Shanghai Company, in response to this newspaper's scholarship campaign and in view of the custom of giving New Year's money at the end of each lunar year, while children often waste it on unclean snacks or even participate in gambling, which is contrary to the principle of thrift during this time of material hardship, has specially issued New Year's coupons. Ten percent of the proceeds from the sale of coupons will be donated to the two newspapers' scholarship and loan funds, while the coupons can still be fully redeemed for daily necessities, transforming waste into something beneficial. In order to maximize revenue, the company has specially entrusted this newspaper and the Jinan Company on Jing'an Temple Road to sell the coupons. Since the launch of this campaign, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, with a continuous stream of people going to the company's gift certificate department, this newspaper's office, and Jinan Company to purchase them. However, there are only a few days left until the end of the lunar year, and it is hoped that all sectors will advocate and promote it to jointly support this charity.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Stroke Treatment Medicine</p>
<p>The Chinese Pharmaceutical Company has hired experts to study traditional Chinese medicine using scientific methods, achieving considerable success. Recently, they invented Weixueping, manufactured under the supervision of the affiliated Xianhecao Su Factory, which is an effective medicine for treating stroke. It can immediately show efficacy for general hypertension, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, palpitation, chronic nephritis, etc., and has cured many people. In order to support this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao newspaper's relief for out-of-school students, they have specially donated 50 bottles of Weixueping, each bottle worth 2,000 yuan, totaling 100,000 yuan, to be used as charity sale items. Those suffering from hypertension are urged to purchase and take it as soon as possible, as it can both treat stroke and relieve out-of-school students, truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Fruit Platters Coming to an End</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Xincai, the owner of the Tongxue Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Shanzhong Road, and Taichang Confectionery and Food Company, has donated 30 exquisite fruit platters from his company, each worth 10,000 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan, for this charity sale to support education in response to this newspaper's scholarship campaign. The fruit platters are filled with high-quality candies, beautiful and generous, suitable for both gifting and personal use. Since the start of the charity sale, more than 20 platters have already been sold, with satisfactory results. It is heard that the company, in order to end the campaign early before the start of the school season, has a small number of remaining platters, and it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will purchase them as soon as possible to jointly support this charity, so that the scholarship work can be completed as soon as possible. For telephone purchases, call 35907 or 68237, and they will be delivered immediately without delivery charges.</p>
