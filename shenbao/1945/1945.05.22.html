<h3>政治平等經濟彘惠　日堅持對華方針　駐華各使節昨在東京開會</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日東鄉大東亞相，於十九，二十雨日，舉行大陸連絡會議後，鑒於情勢之推移，爲與駐華各使節洽商對華政策之運營起見，又於二十一日在大東亞省官邸舉行日駐華大使館事務所長會議，出席者有駐華谷大使，楠本，土田，八里三公使及駐外各關係官等，大東亞省方面有東鄉大東亞相，田尻次官等，就日本堅持對華之方針，議決將加强力實施之方策。</p>
<p>大東亞相東鄕訓詞</p>
<p>東鄉大東亞相即席致訓辭，大旨稱，日本對華外交政策之基礎，於政治方面爲求平等，於經濟方面爲求互惠，此項政策永久不渝。隨時局之進展，日本對華問題之重要性，益形擴大，日本除援助中國之統一及完成其自主·獨立外，並於政治方面求平等，經濟方面求互惠，確立中日問之親善關係，此係日本堅持之根本方針，因此，日本必須克服一切障書，舊蘄實現其根本方針，蓋此與日本克服當前難關具有密切關係也。</p>
<h3>日神風隊及空軍　繼續猛攻敵船艦　沖繩陸上戰鬥益趨激烈</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日美兩方現皆以冲繩戰鬥爲大東亞戰之決戰塲，此殆無疑義，敵於冲繩本島登陸以來，雖蒙極重損害，然尚以全力對冲繩戰塲陸續增援，其數量口有增加。十七日左右，冲繩島附近敵特設空母數量激增，運輸船亦顯著增加，對列島一帶來襲機數曾一度減至每日二百架，十七，十八兩日又復增至三百架以上。日軍神風特攻隊及各空軍部隊，繼續加以猛攻，蓋冲繩戰鬥情勢重大，不容吾人片刻懈怠，尤以陸上戰鬥更爲激烈，前途不可樂觀。陸上戰鬥勝利，乃海上戰鬥之先決條件，故無此次陸上戰鬥繼續展開，則特攻隊之戰果亦不能如是輝煌，其原因如下：　日特攻隊當敵艦船機動部隊活動時，可發輝最大能力，若陸上戰鬥終了，則敵對地上補給亦當減少，不復於周　集結多數艦船，　陸上基地如減少活躍，則敵機動部隊對該方活躍恐亦減低，日軍對其攻擊，亦不得充分發揮威力，　敵如能擴充陸上基地至某種程度，則九州，四國以及朝觧附近，亦劃入其戰鬥機哨戒範國內，若是則日機活躍相當遲純化，且向大陸輸送之危險亦加甚，　於此種塲合，敵方有準備次期作戰之時間，由上述各點，可見日本爲獲得勝利，爲使特攻隊充分發揮威力，冲繩島陸海軍必須協力一致，故日軍陸上部隊乃排除萬難，對敵方之重壓，加以澈底反攻。</p>
<h3>日札木中隊　施巧妙戰術</h3>
<p>南方基地二十一日中央社電　泰拉干戰綫之戰鬥，愈趨激烈，日軍到處破敵，日海陸戰隊札木中隊之勇戰，尤堪重視，該中隊探知敵軍於泰拉干島東岸亞馬兩方面登陸，乘其不備，予以痛創，尤以十二，十三兩日戰門，使蠢動於該中隊前方之敵軍一中隊，全被殲滅，此役鹵獲戰專，步槍，手溜彈等甚多，其間，敵軍雖曾企圖遮斷該中隊之退路，然該中隊以巧妙之戰術，終將敵軍企圖粉碎，其迅速果敢之行動，極爲全軍所稱讚。</p>
<h3>納卯激戰</h3>
<p>菲島二十一日中央社電　納卯方面之敵軍，自十六日以來，以納卯河右岸地區爲攻擊重點目標，於熾烈砲火轟擊掩護下，出動戰車數輛攻擊，該方面之戰鬥已漸趨熾烈，北面運輸船六艘，於十六日抵達納卯灣，似有使增援軍登陸之勢，自五月十四日至十六日之三日間，該方而日軍部隊，殺傷敵兵約二百名，擊落敵機五架，擊破戰車三輛，裝甲車一輛及加農砲一門。又十七日正午，有敵軍約四百名並戰車二稱，侵入納卯東方七公里之地點，該方面日軍部隊，刻正與之交戰中。</p>
<h3>浙省計劃　疏濬河流</h3>
<p>杭州二十一日中央社電　浙省農業策進會，以上年杭縣擬具上塘河疏濬計劃，所受之益面積達二萬餘畝，茲擬在本年度內，對蕭山聞家堰之湘河，設法疏濬，並修築各閘壩，以利灌溉，該處爲浙東最大之水源，且有支流甚多，其與西湖水利不相上下。其經費俟工程計劃詳細擬訂後，再行決定。</p>
<p>試植農作優良品種</p>
<p>又該會本度內擬就省立農事試騐所及各地合作社之示範農塲，先向中農實騐所徴集業已育成之各項優良品種，分行地方試騐比較供試之材料，夏作以稻爲主，冬作以小麥爲主，其他雜繼及特用農作品，當視地方情形之不同，參酌試騐，俟有成效後，再行大量繁殖，推廣於農村，以增强生產，至其經濟，現由省方試騐機關及各合作社示範農塲核定事業費內支用。</p>
<h3>東海岸各據點　日軍勇戰中　美軍犧牲突破二萬名</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地二十一日中央社電　冲繩本島十八·十九兩日前綫依然劇戰，日守備隊刻正仍於東海岸六〇六高地·一五〇高地·五一高地之各據點陣地勇敢善戰中。自九日敵以全兵力集中對日主要陣地發動總攻擊以來，茲已十日，敵不分晝夜，以龐大之物量及優勢之兵力，不惜犧牲，陸續强進，日前綫將士，亦隨時予以重創，敵之犧牲已突破二萬名。現在之戰綫，距離九日當時之我謝西原高地，前田南方澤　安謝之連結綫，僅二百米至二千米，日將士之奮勇，實堪驚人。敵之陳營最近已漸顯疲憊，而敵强力攻擊之那霸北方之天美台方面，近數日來反覆激戰，日軍所在部隊，則於後方砲兵陣地巧妙掩護下，堅守該地。十八日以來，該方面之敵軍攻擊已呈頓挫狀態，但專持兵衆之敵，將必對該地再發動新攻勢，而企圖於日主要陣地側背登陸之敵方艦船，其蠢動之情形，仍未可輕視。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　美軍突入連結那霸，首里與那原之日軍陣地，旨在攻落支配三市之重要高地，日美之間屢次演成熾烈之拉鋸戰，在此戰綫之美軍四師，實有應付不暇之狀。據關島之合衆社電，承認冲繩之苦戰，茲根據尼米資司令部所報吿十八日之戰况如次：美海軍第一師團對那霸東北方之棒砂糖高地，艱苦戰鬥，巳達極點，但陵角南方側面，依然在日軍手中。此地帶爲屛障冲繩戰綫西翼之要點，美海軍於過去一週內，發動攻勢達九次，迄未成功，僅尾根一地，於十八日激戰中，曾四易其主。美海軍第一師第七聯隊，向前推進約二百米，並迫近棒砂糖高地南方側面之大名溪谷，但結果仍由前已佔領之大名·澤岻陣地退却。首里東北方之美陸軍七十七師，於十八日兩度佔領小高地，但因蒙受野砲及日砲之熾烈射擊，被迫而後退，又日軍對美軍陣地之堅壘，刻以手溜彈奮戰中。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　於冲繩作戰，遭日軍特攻隊猛攻，美軍兵員蒙受重創，據紐約來電，合衆社訊，四月一日以來，於冲繩作戰陣亡者，僅海軍兵員即達四千名，此乃日軍特攻隊飛機繼續不斷猛烈攻擊之明證。</p>
<h3>渝六全會閉幕通過各案</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中英社電　據重慶電：六全大會十八日決定下列各項要案：　確立立憲政體，改善民衆生活。　協力英美建立世界安全保障機構。　相互締結互助協定及商業協定。　實現蒙古及西藏民族的地方自治。　改善國軍配備及官兵待遇。　言論報道·集會結社·宗敎及硏究學問之自由。　在經濟社會政治敎育上實現男女平等。　以普及民衆敎育掃除文盲為目標，獎勵實現成人敎育。</p>
<p>斯本二十一日中央社電　據重慶電：蔣介石卞九日以國民黨總裁資格全大會提出五項議案，請求採納，　各重慶軍內之國民黨部，三個月內一律取消，　學校內不設黨部，三民主義靑年團作爲靑訓機關，由政府接收，　重慶政權下各縣市，限於六個月內施行選擧，組織縣巿參政會，有半數以上之縣巿存有縣巿參政會之省份，即日起施行選舉，樹立臨時省參政會，以為省之代表機關，担當政務。　制定政黨組織法，對國民黨以外各政黨予以合法地位，　　正期間，在國民黨下運用之行政機關由政府接收。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據渝電：渝國民黨六全大會於本月五日開會以來，已繼續舉行二十次會議，預定於二十一日閉幕。此次六全大會之主旨，在召集國民大會準備實施憲政，但除決定國民大會之期日以外，最重要之選舉代表問題，憲法草案問題，均委之六屆中央執行委員會之決定。衆所注目之對共黨決議案，如果以此比較延安方面舉行之七全大會之積極攻勢，則誠相形見絀，足證重慶對延安政策之蹉跎不定。又渝六全大會於外交報告時，決議加强對蘇聯之友好關係，於政治報告之決議中，指摘重慶政治之缺點，此點極具興味。此外，渝國民黨專汲汲於保楊實施憲政後之本黨勢力，蓋重慶方面六全大會之最重要決議案，即爲第十七次大會所通過蔣德裁提議之「促進憲政實施之各種必要措置案」該案規定得於此後三個月內，廢止軍隊內附設之黨部及取消各學校內之黨部。據偸方宣稱，「此至少已證明國民黨在憲政實施時期中，努力劃分黨和政的界限，以利憲政之推行」，而該案一方面將三民主義靑年團由黨方面移之直屬於政府，以此定爲訓練靑年之機關，此點極堪注目，證明渝方之用意，雖已取消軍隊及學校內附設之黨部，而在另一方面則依然欲置之於渝國民黨之支配權下。</p>
<p>又大會十八日議決之政綱政策，其內容並非應付今日之戰時下政策，而仍堅決其應付戰後平時之原則論，列舉從三民主義之原則，推到一般的方策，此又爲渝國民黨以國民大會作口實，爲對抗其他黨派起見，列舉其原則的政策，希圖吸引民衆。又十九日之大會決議，將中央執監委員人數增加到四六〇名，俾可由是取得國民大會中決定之國民黨指名代表二四〇名，及當然代表之中央執監委員四六〇名，合計七○〇名之純國民黨代表，確保一四四〇名國民大會代表中約半　之多數議決票數，證明渝國民黨準備欲獲得左右國民大會之勢力，故已引起各方之非難。</p>
<h3>軍事評論家闡述　最近政戰趨勢　英美蘇對立將更深刻化</h3>
<p>中央社訊　德意志經五年來之奮鬥，不幸失敗，向英·美聯合軍降服，於是歐洲戰事乃吿一段洛，而英·美方面爲謀東亞戰爭早日結束，不惜將作戰中心移赴太平洋，連日以來，美軍在冲繩島遭受日軍猛烈殲擊，損害慘重，故益陷泥潭，美軍由於冲繩島作戰毫無效果，為牽制戰局計，最近似有作新蠢動之企圖，日本方面早有充分準備，靜待痛擊來襲擊人，頃由軍事評論家就最近世界政局及戰局情形曁其趨勢，作詳細闡述，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>美國遭遇空遂打擊</p>
<p>歐戰結束下之英美，將作戰中心移赴太平洋上，窺其主要戰力，　爲尼米資統率向冲繩島之作戰，　爲麥克沃塞率領在呂宋島，民答那峨及泰拉千之作戰，　英印軍之向緬甸及在孟加拉灣方面，　美國以馬里亞納作爲航空轟炸主要中心基地。在冲繩島方面，日本特攻隊及航空部隊，連日向敵艦船猛烈攻擊，行見敵美將被擊滅。冲島陸上那覇首里之北與那原間一帶，仍在激烈作戰，情况凄烈，尤其日軍之戰力業已漸見奏效，過去敵美第四軍之在冲繼登陸，認爲日軍之抵抗出乎意料之薄弱，但米料及目前日軍之攻擊已超越硫黃島以上之激烈程度。據本月二十日舊金山電，美戰時放送局廣播稱，至十九止，美軍戰死者計入干人，負傷二萬六千人，又同日據德里電稱，尼米　司令部廣播，美戰死者爲八千三百十人，戰傷者爲二萬二千二百十六人，可見美國二方面所發表之數字錯誤百出，且又朦蔽損害，以多報少，其間並未包括在海上損害兵力。此外，饒有趣味問題，並非在於量的多少，乃爲本身之性質問題，根據十七日舊金山戰時放送局之發表　，美兵員戰死者爲三千六百七十一人，戰傷者爲一萬五千六百二十五人，合計爲一萬九千二百九十六人，統計十八。十九兩日之美戰死者爲四千六百三十九人，負傷者爲六千五百九十一人，總共爲一萬一千二百三十人，故以此數平均美軍死傷每日有五千六百十二人，每小時有二百三十四人，每分鐘爲四人·過去硫黃島美軍死傷，平均每分鐘爲三人，損害達三萬以上，已引起國內輿論譁然，但至目前之冲繩戰局上，美軍每分鐘平均死傷四人，實爲美國有史以來空前之打擊。</p>
<p>移兵計劃頗難實現</p>
<p>美軍在冲繩作戰，死傷慘重，據二十日舊金山廣播稱，美軍屢次在冲繼佔領那覇之丘陵一帶，結果於爲日軍奪回，可見美國尼米資企間之跳島戰略誇耀於世界，不幸此項新機動部隊作北上之行動，企圖開始新的作戰。同時，尚有麥克沃泰企圖在馬里亞納作爲加强戰力上之轟炸基地，以圖打開新的出路，此項種種表現，美國已陷於長期戰之現象，美國原希望之短期作戰，其衷心焦急如焚，更於歐戰結束後之美國，國內充滿和平希望空氣，求早日結束戰爭，故美國已蘊臓着作戰上之困難，並顯露尼米資之作戰失敗，美國本打算將歐洲兵力移往太平洋戰塲，惟因外交上，軍事上種種關係，頗難移調，在此情形下，美軍一旦在冲繩失敗，則其作戰前途，當必困難無疑。</p>
<p>舊金山會議吿敗</p>
<p>其次，國際政局方面，美國爲希望獲得相當效果所舉行之舊金山會議，結果蘇代表莫洛托夫之歸國，英代表艾登之回國及渝代表宋子文所發表之返渝，此項會議之效果如何，頗爲明顯。美國因在政治上不能獲得達成目的之希望，乃有討論保障世界和平問題之舉，從事以法律方式進行，此外，並宣布世界各地島嶼佔領管理問題，在英美蘇澳加法各國間，始終未獲得一致意見，暗礁重重，美國企圖以政治達成理想希望支舊金山會議，結果形成法律方式，以技術手段攏成爲小組會議，其最大原因，實由於波闌問題爲主。英美蘇醖釀糾紛，始終堅持不決，以蘇聯爲背量之波蘭盧布林政權及逮捕波關亡命政治要人之問題，盧曾稱本身爲代表波闌最有價値之政權，然此已使英國措置無從，同時蘇聯史太林於十九日之廣播，就解決波闌問題，特發表三項原則。</p>
<p>自十六世紀以來，在歷史上蘊藏最大困難之波闌問題，我人以客觀之立塲，靜窺英美蘇間之糾紛醖釀，以如何方法謀取解決。</p>
<p>再蘇聯因擁護奧地利政權，美表示不承認，且有南期拉夫蒂托政權，最近以武力進達亞得利亞海，美英方面竟又稱在未成立締約前，必以武力應付武力，在中歐方面之種種糾紛，已崛起萌芽。</p>
<p>國際情勢錯綜複雜</p>
<p>晚近世耙以還波羅的海至亞得利亞海方面，日耳曼民族及斯拉夫民族不斷作正背之鬥爭，如今德國已告失敗，現在已成爲汎斯拉夫民族與盎格魯撒克遜民族及拉丁民族之問題，又陷激烈之鬥爭。</p>
<p>關於對德戰爭處理方面，聯合國方而成立一委員會，今後英美蘇對戰時罪犯與俘虜之處理，以及所謂產業文化經濟上之指導，將逐漸暴露其意見。</p>
<p>我人如轉易目標，觀察位居東亞之中國，如延安及渝政據之對立，乃即爲英美蘇所造成，與歐洲方面如同一轍。</p>
<p>至近東與巴爾幹方面，歷經數年來世界大戰之瀰漫，各弱小國家所受牽制及均衡影響，有重行編組必要，故在該項問題，英美蘇間之對立，當更深刻化。</p>

<p>徐州二十一日中央社電　淮海省郝省長，鑒於當此非常時局，欲完成決戰體制，必須動員身心總力，一面推進各種建設，一面積極共同防禦，始能　致最後勝利，特組織淮海省總動員實施委員會，下分精神人力總動員委員會，並於各行政督察專員公署設置總動員實施委員會辦公室，市縣政府則不另設機構，而以市縣長爲中心，督飭各責任機關，依照方案，分別實施，區公署則設總動員實踐會議，以鄉長爲中心，實施各項方案。總動員實施委員會委員長由郝省長兼任，下取秘書長一人，副秘書長二人，常委九人，委員十二人，均已派定。至於實施項目，精神總動員方面，如樹立中心思想，倡導勞動服務，實行黎明運動，普行國民體操等。人力總動員方面，如務使農民增產工作，實施學生軍事訓練，强化警防團訓練，强化鄉村自衛團·辦理職業登記，指導既成帮會團體，協力水陸連輸事業，組織婦女會，提倡家庭副業，普遍組織互助會，以安定民生等。物力總動員方面，如確保民資，不使流入匪區，增加農產品，以應需用，振興水利，開井，開渠，修堤，開墾荒地，培植山林，振興煤鐵等礦業，實行農村貸款，以調劑農村金融，普遍提倡手工業，施行局部經濟統制，勵行合理支配，並統計生活消費輸出織入量，以調節物資之供需，積極整理水陸運輸，以加强物資輸送，使對軍需民需之供應益趨圓滑等，均已擬定方案，即可分別付諸實施。此次總動員會施委員會之設立，不僅組織機構堅强週密，且各項實施方案亦係經縝密研討後始予確定者，辦法極爲詳確，預料必能獲得理想之成果。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>嚴重的物價問題</h3>
<p>本市物價，這幾天又呈飛騰狂態，巿民生活，遭受極嚴重的威脅。有關方面，實有迅謀適當緊急對策之必要。</p>
<p>我們觀察最近本市物價騰勢，有幾點値得特別注意的：第一，就物價的週期性躍騰而言。過去數年間，雖云嚴實，但升漲週期的期間，或爲半年，或爲季節性之上騰，並與通貨之自然增發相適應。但自去年下半年以來，漸失常態，週期之距離日期漸近，自本年二月漲潮以來，更變本加厲，不足兩個月即出現新高潮，不意自上月中旬金融市塲混亂以來，一月之間，而新的狂漲又復出現；相對的安定期愈見短促，則今後勢將無時不在漲潮中了。</p>
<p>第二，　察最近數次物價漲勢，既有如上述之特徴，顯非通貨膨脹之直接結果。其間最可注目者，厥爲每次漲潮，均與國際國內之時局有關。吾人但須稍一回憶上月初旬國際及國內之時事，而觀上月中句之漲潮；再就本月上句國際之時事，而觀本月中句開始之新漲潮，即可充分明瞭其間顯有大投機者利用人民某種不安心理而從中活動之痕跡。如不此之謀，則今後市塲及社會將無安定之日。</p>
<p>此次漲價，與以前數次不同者，亦値得注意。如上月中句之波動，係由金條及股票之瘋狂跳躍展開者，四月中句末金融市塲以當局之緊急措置而告平息，但旋即有日用品市塲之漲勢繼起。而此次金價以金證券之發行，暫告穩定；設市亦以取締便交而無大波浪發生；完全由米價之　躍，糸涉生活必需品之新漲潮。</p>
<p>綜觀上述，我們可以獲得這樣的概念，即：第一，此項漲勢差不多接踵上次而起，非盡由於通貨膨脹；但至少說明金證劵發行之成績雖佳，而對於收回通貨平抑物價未奏功效。第二，如何安定人心，取締投機，雖爲老生常談，但至今仍爲物價對策最主耍之一環；而經濟警察及其他適當措施，實不容稍懈。第三，對於足以發生領導物價漲勢作用之商品及其價格，應採緊急之措施。</p>
<p>關於通貨膨脹，當局雖有一再宜示，而我門亦認共爲近來物價上漲之主因，但人民不信任幣値的觀念，當局對於過去通貸對策之革新，顯極必要。有人說，最近現鈔缺乏，曾造成相當恐慌，所以收縮通貨，無此必要。這種只見技葉不見森林之論，自無一顧價値。須知所謂現鈔缺乏是人爲的，往往是新的膨脹的信號，這是誰都看得到的；而且最嚴重的，是在現鈔缺乏之時，信用通貨突然膨脹，銀行錢莊發出了凌駕實際需要的大量票據，無異助成政府促巡惡牲通貨膨脹，實有迅謀適當對策的必要。此外，我們認爲如何切實穩定幣値，安定人心，實爲必要之舉。對於投機者之活動，這也是最有效的對策。</p>
<p>此次領導物價新高潮的，是米價之跳躍；而此次米價之跳躍，雖不免有投機者操縱及販戶扳俏等因素，但主要者實由於外埠米價尤其是杭州等地米價的高漲；致使本市食米來源短絀。所以我們希望：第一，由官民合作，疏通食米來源，防制囤積居奇；第二，繼續舉辦平價米，以救眉急；第三，儘可能恢復戶口米，否則亦當儘速配給戶口雜糧。如果這三者做到了或只做到一部分，至少對於本市米價以至一般物價，可收穩定之效。</p>
<p>當然，這還只是緊急對策而已，根本的，有如十八日大陸新報所述，必須設法復興工業及疏通物資來源，解決工業用煤，原料，電力及疏通運輸，取締非法徴稅等等，不過這些辦法，在今日尚有緩不鴻急之處，所以當以此爲治本的準備，而先實施上述治標的緊急對策。同時，如何採取適合國情的經濟統制及改善經濟統制的一切技術，迅速適應新時勢之要求，而作斷然的措置，以一新國人的耳目，在安定人心防制投機方面，更可收盯當現實的效果。</p>

<h3>領域問題紛爭　南國致美牒文　美國務副卿發表談話</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據此間接獲消息：美國務院曾於日前接獲南斯拉夫政府要求有權管理托里埃斯特及附近地區之文書一件，美國務副鄉格魯特於週六在華盛頓接見記者團時，發表如下之談話。該項文書內容包括南政府耍求領域更改重行劃分，及提犧設法解決此次五月十二日南國人員與美代理國務卿間突有不能融洽之爭議。格魯復稱，目前美國政府實不應以武力之佔領，來解決領域糾紛，反之，應採取重整領域分配之方式，來排解該項問題。但南「愛國份子」意圖强行奪權管理該地，致影響該地美司令官不能維持秩序或執行美政府所託付渠統治該地，及處理奧地利被佔領後各項問題之重大任務，現美政府正與其他各國政府愼重商討此項困難問題。</p>
<p>卡林西亞南軍撤退</p>

<h3>今日之眞茹</h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>頹垣殘壁</p>
<p>從嘉定南翔一帶回來，道經眞茹，順便訪問了一番。入鎭之初，首先現在眼簾的，是些破殘的磚牆，聳堅在市梢頭，這是當年戰事的遺跡，顯得非常凄凉。在大街兩旁的店家，十之八是糧食店，經過一頂小木橋——香花橋，便見一個陳舊的牌坊，再前進就是一座宏大的古廟——萬壽寺。據當地人士說：是明代建造的，到現在已有幾百年了。從廟內存着的古物，推測起來，的是不錯，如在第一殿內，坐着一尊笑口常開的彌勒佛，是靑銅籌的，背後有「大明乙酉年三月籌」的八字刻着。廳上有一只鐵香爐旁邊，也刻有「乾隆三十七年」字樣。第二殿便是大雄寶殿，高約二丈，除完整的如來佛和幾尊破殘的羅漢外，便餘無所存了。據當地父老們說：鎭名「眞茹」的來源，就在於此，因如來佛塑得逼傎，所以大衆說：「像傎的如來佛」，當時就定名爲「傎如」，到後來才改爲「傎茹」的。</p>
<p>在大殿旁的魯班殿上，廣聚着各種賭徒，在光天化日之下，公然聚赌，無人干涉。</p>
<p>鎮公所的組織，簡單得很，祗有鎭長與職員各一人。治安方面，從前有警察駐在的時候，常有搶案發生，現在平靖得很，祗不過小竊的偸案，每夜至少有一二起，此輩大都是吃白粉的的無業遊民。</p>
<p>眞茹最熱鬧的市面，是早晨的菜巿，因為本地田畝是種植蔬菜的，而米是一粒不出的，所以完全仰給於南翔一帶，由販戶運來，價格當然貴了。各種物價除菜與米外，大都較上海高出二成。</p>
<p>敎育醫藥</p>
<p>從前敎育是很發達的，自滬戰發生後，各校校舍，全成廢墟，以致弦歌中輟；後來雖有一二熱心人士，預備設校補救，但因陋就簡，無法擴充；因此里人李培生等，經種種困難，始於三十二年一月，創設眞光小學，開辦費全由旅滬同鄉募捐而得，經常費用，全靠學費收入，以百分之八十爲敎薪，餘充辦公費用，所收學費，亦較他校爲低，祗有斗米之價，現有學生三百二十五人。對淸寒子弟，尚有免費學額。</p>
<p>當地醫藥方面，除一二私人診所外。簡實毫無設備。因此每至炎夏，疫癘滋生，即感束手無策了。該鄉熱心人士，因此組設施診給藥所，到現在已辦了四屆，成績優良，每屆得救活平民三千人以上，經費藥物全由各界捐助，每屆結束時，不足之數，則由傎光小學創辦慈善球賽，門券所入，以爲補償經費之用。創設以來，因組織健全，賬目淸楚，頗得各界人士稱道。今年物價飛漲，經費無着，尚望各界人士踴躍捐助。</p>

<h3>Political Equality and Economic Mutual Benefit: Japan Insists on its Policy Towards China; Resident Ambassadors to China Held a Meeting in Tokyo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Togo, the Greater East Asia Minister of Japan, held a Continental Liaison Conference on the 19th and 20th. Considering the development of the situation and in order to consult with the resident ambassadors in China on the operation of the China policy, he held a meeting of the heads of the Japanese embassies and consulates in China at the official residence of the Greater East Asia Ministry on the 21st. Those present included Ambassador Gu to China, Ministers Kusonoto, Tsuchida, and Hachiri, and other relevant officials stationed abroad. From the Greater East Asia Ministry, there were Greater East Asia Minister Togo, Vice Minister Tajiri, and others. They discussed Japan's insistence on its policy towards China and resolved to strengthen its implementation.</p>
<p>Minister of Greater East Asia Togo's Address</p>
<p>Greater East Asia Minister Togo delivered an impromptu address, stating in essence that the basis of Japan's diplomatic policy towards China is to seek equality in the political sphere and mutual benefit in the economic sphere. This policy will never change. With the progress of the situation, the importance of the China issue to Japan is expanding. In addition to assisting China's unification and achieving its autonomy and independence, Japan seeks equality in the political sphere and mutual benefit in the economic sphere to establish friendly relations between China and Japan. This is the fundamental policy that Japan adheres to. Therefore, Japan must overcome all obstacles and strive to realize its fundamental policy, as this is closely related to Japan's overcoming of the current difficulties.</p>
<h3>Japan's Kamikaze Corps and Air Force Continue to Vigorously Attack Enemy Ships; The Battle on Land in Okinawa Becomes Increasingly Fierce</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - There is little doubt that both Japan and the United States now regard the Battle of Okinawa as the decisive battleground of the Greater East Asia War. Although the enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses since landing on the main island of Okinawa, it is still using all its strength to continuously reinforce the Okinawa battlefield, and the number of troops is increasing. Around the 17th, the number of enemy special aircraft carriers near Okinawa Island increased sharply, and the number of transport ships also increased significantly. The number of aircraft attacking the archipelago once decreased to 200 per day, but on the 17th and 18th, it increased again to more than 300. The Japanese military's Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and various air force units continue to launch fierce attacks. The situation in the Battle of Okinawa is of great importance, and we cannot afford to be negligent for a moment. In particular, the land battle is becoming increasingly fierce, and the future is not optimistic. Victory in the land battle is a prerequisite for the sea battle. Therefore, without the continued development of this land battle, the results of the special attack corps would not be so brilliant. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>When the enemy's fleet and mobile units are active, the Japanese special attack corps can exert its greatest ability. If the land battle ends, the enemy's supplies to the ground will also decrease, and they will no longer gather a large number of ships around them. If the land base is less active, the enemy's mobile units' activity in that direction will likely decrease, and the Japanese military will not be able to fully exert its power in attacking them. If the enemy can expand the land base to a certain extent, then Kyushu, Shikoku, and the vicinity of Korea will also be included in the combat aircraft patrol range. If this is the case, the activity of Japanese aircraft will be considerably delayed, and the danger of transporting supplies to the mainland will also increase. In this situation, the enemy will have time to prepare for the next operation. From the above points, it can be seen that in order for Japan to achieve victory and for the special attack corps to fully exert its power, the army and navy on Okinawa Island must cooperate. Therefore, the Japanese land forces are overcoming all difficulties to thoroughly counterattack the enemy's heavy pressure.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Zamu Detachment Employs Ingenious Tactics</h3>
<p>Southern Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - The battle on the Tarakan front is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese army is defeating the enemy everywhere. The valiant fighting of the Zamu detachment of the Japanese marines is particularly noteworthy. The detachment learned that the enemy troops had landed on the east coast of Tarakan Island on both sides of the Yama, and launched a surprise attack, inflicting heavy damage. In particular, the battle on the 12th and 13th annihilated an entire enemy company moving in front of the detachment. This battle yielded many spoils of war, including rifles and hand grenades. During this time, the enemy attempted to cut off the detachment's retreat, but the detachment used ingenious tactics to crush the enemy's attempt. Their swift and decisive actions were highly praised by the entire army.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Davao</h3>
<p>Philippines, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the 16th, the enemy troops in the Davao area have focused their attacks on the right bank of the Davao River. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, they launched several tanks to attack. The battle in this area has gradually become fierce. Six transport ships in the north arrived at Davao Bay on the 16th, seemingly to land reinforcements. In the three days from May 14th to 16th, the Japanese troops in this area killed or wounded about 200 enemy soldiers, shot down five enemy planes, destroyed three tanks, one armored vehicle, and one cannon. Also, at noon on the 17th, about 400 enemy soldiers and two tanks invaded a point seven kilometers east of Davao. Japanese troops in that area are currently engaged in combat with them.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Plans to Dredge Rivers</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Association, based on the benefits of the Shangtang River dredging plan prepared by Hang County last year, which benefited an area of more than 20,000 mu, plans to dredge the Xiang River in Wenjia Weir, Xiaoshan, this year and build various dams to facilitate irrigation. This is the largest water source in eastern Zhejiang, with many tributaries, comparable to the water conservancy of West Lake. The expenses will be decided after the detailed engineering plan is prepared.</p>
<p>Trying to Plant Superior Varieties of Crops</p>
<p>Also, the association plans to collect various superior varieties that have already been developed from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and demonstration farms of cooperatives in various places in the province this year, and conduct comparative trials in local areas. The materials for the trials will be mainly rice for summer crops and wheat for winter crops. Other miscellaneous grains and special agricultural products will be considered and tested according to the different local conditions. After successful results are achieved, they will be propagated on a large scale and promoted in rural areas to increase production. As for the funding, it will be used from the business expenses approved by the provincial experimental agencies and demonstration farms of various cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Valiantly Fighting at Each Stronghold on the East Coast; American Military Sacrifice Exceeds 20,000</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - Fierce battles continued on the front line of Okinawa Island on the 18th and 19th. The Japanese garrison is still bravely fighting in the positions of each stronghold on the east coast, including Heights 606, 150, and 51. It has been ten days since the enemy launched a general offensive against the main Japanese positions with all its forces on the 9th. The enemy, day and night, is relentlessly advancing with huge amounts of material and superior forces at the cost of sacrifice. The soldiers on the front line are also inflicting heavy damage on them at any time. The enemy's sacrifices have exceeded 20,000. The current battle line is only 200 to 2,000 meters away from the Xiexi Yuan Highland, Maeda Southern Marsh, and Anxie connected line at the time of the 9th. The bravery of the Japanese soldiers is truly astonishing. The enemy's positions have recently shown signs of fatigue. The enemy's strong attack on the Amanetai area north of Naha has been repeatedly fought fiercely in recent days. The Japanese troops stationed there are defending the area under the skillful cover of the rear artillery positions. Since the 18th, the enemy's attacks in this area have stalled, but the enemy, with its large number of troops, will certainly launch a new offensive against this area. The movements of enemy ships attempting to land on the flanks and backs of the main Japanese positions cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The American troops broke into the Japanese army's positions connecting Naha, Shuri, and Nahara, aiming to capture the important highlands dominating the three cities. Fierce tug-of-war battles have repeatedly occurred between Japan and the United States. The four American divisions on this front line are indeed unable to cope. According to a report from the United Press in Guam, acknowledging the bitter battle in Okinawa, the battle situation on the 18th reported by the Nimitz Command is as follows: The 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy is engaged in a hard-fought battle on the Sugar Cane Highland northeast of Naha, which has reached its peak, but the southern side of the ridge is still in the hands of the Japanese army. This area is a key point for shielding the western flank of the Okinawa front. The US Navy launched nine offensives in the past week, but has not succeeded. Only the ridge area changed hands four times in a fierce battle on the 18th. The 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the United States Navy advanced about 200 meters and approached the Omyo Valley on the southern side of the Sugar Cane Highland, but as a result, it retreated from the previously occupied Omyo and Takushi positions. The 77th Division of the US Army northeast of Shuri occupied a small highland twice on the 18th, but was forced to retreat due to the fierce fire of field artillery and Japanese artillery. Also, the Japanese army is fighting fiercely with hand grenades against the American army's strongholds.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - In the battle of Okinawa, the American troops suffered heavy losses from the Japanese military's special attack corps' fierce attacks. According to a New York dispatch from the United Press, since April 1st, the naval personnel killed in action in Okinawa alone have reached 4,000, which is clear evidence of the Japanese military's special attack corps' continuous and relentless attacks.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang Concludes, Passing Various Proposals</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central English Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session decided on the following major issues on the 18th: Establishing a constitutional political system and improving the lives of the people. Cooperating with Britain and the United States to establish a world security guarantee mechanism. Concluding mutual assistance agreements and commercial agreements with each other. Realizing the local autonomy of the Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities. Improving the equipment and treatment of the national army and officers and soldiers. Freedom of speech, reporting, assembly, association, religion, and academic research. Realizing equality between men and women in economic, social, political, and educational fields. Aiming at eliminating illiteracy through popular education and encouraging the realization of adult education.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing: Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as the President of the Kuomintang, submitted five proposals to the plenary session on the 19th, requesting their adoption: All Kuomintang branches within the Chongqing military must be cancelled within three months. No party branches should be established in schools. The Three People's Principles Youth League should serve as a youth training institution and be taken over by the government. Elections should be held in all counties and cities under the Chongqing regime within six months to organize county and city political councils. Provinces with more than half of the counties and cities having county and city political councils should immediately implement elections and establish temporary provincial political councils as representative bodies of the province to assume political affairs. Enact a law on the organization of political parties to grant legal status to political parties other than the Kuomintang. During the period of governance, the administrative agencies operated under the Kuomintang should be taken over by the government.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a telegram from Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang has been held continuously for 20 meetings since it opened on the 5th of this month, and is scheduled to close on the 21st. The main purpose of this Sixth Plenary Session is to convene the National Congress to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. However, in addition to determining the date of the National Congress, the most important issues of electing representatives and the draft constitution have been entrusted to the decision of the Sixth Central Executive Committee. The resolution on the Communist Party, which has attracted much attention, is truly overshadowed when compared with the active offensive of the Seventh Plenary Session held by Yan'an, which proves Chongqing's indecision on its policy towards Yan'an. Also, during the diplomatic report of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang, it was resolved to strengthen friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The resolution in the political report pointed out the shortcomings of Chongqing's politics, which is extremely interesting. In addition, the Chongqing Kuomintang is solely focused on preserving the power of the party after the implementation of constitutional government. The most important resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session in Chongqing is the "Various Necessary Measures to Promote the Implementation of Constitutional Government" proposed by Chiang Kai-shek and passed by the 17th session. The resolution stipulates that within the next three months, the party branches attached to the military must be abolished and the party branches in various schools must be cancelled. According to the claims of the Chongqing side, "This at least proves that the Kuomintang is working to divide the boundaries between the party and the government during the period of implementation of constitutional government to facilitate the implementation of constitutional government." On the one hand, the resolution transfers the Three People's Principles Youth League from the party to be directly under the government, defining it as an institution for training youth. This is extremely noteworthy, proving that the intention of the Chongqing side, although it has cancelled the party branches attached to the military and schools, still wants to place them under the control of the Chongqing Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Also, the policy program resolved by the General Assembly on the 18th is not a policy to cope with the current wartime situation, but still firmly adheres to its principle of coping with peacetime after the war, listing general strategies deduced from the principles of the Three People's Principles. This is another attempt by the Chongqing Kuomintang to use the National Assembly as an excuse to list its principled policies in order to attract the masses and counter other parties. Also, the General Assembly on the 19th resolved to increase the number of central executive and supervisory committee members to 460, so that it could obtain 240 Kuomintang-designated representatives in the National Assembly, as well as 460 central executive and supervisory committee members as ex-officio representatives, totaling 700 pure Kuomintang representatives, ensuring that about half of the 1,440 National Assembly representatives had a majority of votes, proving that the Chongqing Kuomintang was preparing to gain the power to influence the National Assembly, which has aroused criticism from all sides.</p>
<h3>Military Commentator Elaborates on Recent Political and War Trends: The Confrontation Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Will Become More Profound</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - After five years of struggle, Germany unfortunately failed and surrendered to the joint forces of Britain and the United States. Thus, the European war came to an end. In order to end the war in East Asia as soon as possible, Britain and the United States have shifted the center of operations to the Pacific. For days, the American troops on Okinawa Island have suffered fierce annihilation from the Japanese army, and the damage has been severe, so they are increasingly mired in a quagmire. Due to the ineffectiveness of the American military's operations on Okinawa Island, and in order to contain the war situation, there seem to be new attempts to stir up trouble recently. The Japanese side has made full preparations and is waiting to inflict a heavy blow on the attackers. Recently, a military commentator made a detailed elaboration on the recent world political situation, the war situation, and its trends, which are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>The United States Suffers an Air Strike</p>
<p>Britain and the United States, after the end of the European war, shifted the center of operations to the Pacific. Looking at its main combat power: The operations towards Okinawa Island are commanded by Nimitz. The operations in Luzon Island, Mindanao, and Tarakan are led by MacArthur. The British Indian Army is moving towards Burma and in the Bay of Bengal. The United States is using the Mariana Islands as the main central base for aerial bombing. On the Okinawa Island front, Japanese special attack corps and air force units have been fiercely attacking enemy ships for days, and it is expected that the enemy will be wiped out. The area between Naha and Shuri in Okinawa Island and Yonabaru is still in fierce combat, and the situation is tragic. In particular, the combat power of the Japanese army has gradually become effective. In the past, the enemy's Fourth Army landed on Okinawa Island, believing that the resistance of the Japanese army was unexpectedly weak, but the attacks of the American troops and the current Japanese army have exceeded the intensity of Iwo Jima. According to a San Francisco dispatch on the 20th of this month, the US wartime broadcasting station broadcast that as of the 19th, the number of American soldiers killed in action was 10,000, and the number wounded was 26,000. Also, according to a Delhi dispatch on the same day, the Nimitz Command broadcast that the number of American soldiers killed in action was 8,310, and the number wounded was 22,216. It can be seen that the numbers released by the two sides of the United States are full of errors, and they also obscure the damage by reporting more deaths than injuries. They did not include the number of troops damaged at sea. In addition, an interesting issue is not the amount of casualties, but the nature of the casualties. According to the announcement of the San Francisco wartime broadcasting station on the 17th, the number of American soldiers killed in action was 3,671, and the number wounded was 15,625, totaling 19,296. According to the statistics on the 18th and 19th, the number of American soldiers killed in action was 4,639, and the number wounded was 6,591, totaling 11,230. Therefore, on average, the US military has 5,612 casualties per day, 234 casualties per hour, and 4 casualties per minute. In the past Iwo Jima, the US military casualties averaged 3 per minute, and the damage reached more than 30,000, which has caused an uproar in domestic public opinion. However, in the current Okinawa battle, the US military averages 4 casualties per minute, which is an unprecedented blow in American history.</p>
<p>Troop Transfer Plans are Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>The US military has suffered heavy casualties in the Okinawa operation. According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 20th, the US military has repeatedly occupied the hills of Naha, but as a result, the Japanese army has recaptured them. It can be seen that the American Nimitz's inter-island strategy is boasting to the world. Unfortunately, this new mobile unit's action to move north is attempting to start a new operation. At the same time, MacArthur is attempting to strengthen the bombing base in the Mariana Islands in order to open a new way out. These various manifestations show that the United States has fallen into a long-term war. The United States originally hoped for a short-term operation, and its heart is as anxious as fire. After the end of the European war, the United States is filled with a peaceful atmosphere, seeking an early end to the war, so the United States has been burying operational difficulties, and Nimitz's operational failure has been revealed. The United States originally planned to transfer European forces to the Pacific battlefield, but due to various diplomatic and military relations, it is difficult to transfer them. Under these circumstances, if the US military fails in Okinawa, its operational prospects will undoubtedly be difficult.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference Fails</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the international political situation, the San Francisco Conference held by the United States in the hope of achieving considerable results resulted in the return of Soviet representative Molotov, the return of British representative Eden, and the announcement by Chongqing representative Song Ziwen that he would return to Chongqing. The effect of this conference is quite obvious. The United States, because it could not achieve its goals in the political arena, then discussed the issue of guaranteeing world peace, and proceeded in a legal manner. In addition, the issue of the occupation and management of islands around the world was announced, but a consensus could not be reached between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, and France. There were many hidden reefs. The San Francisco Conference, where the United States attempted to achieve its ideal hopes through politics, ended up forming a legal method and forming a small group meeting through technical means. The biggest reason for this is the issue of Poland. The dispute between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union continued to brew, and no decision was made. The question of the Lublin regime in Poland, backed by the Soviet Union, and the arrest of Polish exiled political figures, once claimed that it itself was the most valuable regime representing Poland, but this has made it impossible for Britain to take measures. At the same time, Soviet Stalin broadcast on the 19th, specifically publishing three principles for resolving the Polish issue.</p>
<p>Since the 16th century, the Polish issue, which has harbored the greatest difficulties in history, we, from an objective standpoint, quietly observe the brewing of disputes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and seek solutions in what way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Soviet Union supports the Austrian regime, but the United States expressed its disapproval. And there is the Tito regime in South Yugoslavia, which recently advanced to the Adriatic Sea by force. The United States and Britain have unexpectedly claimed that they will respond to force with force before the conclusion of the treaty. Various disputes in Central Europe have sprouted and are growing.</p>
<p>The International Situation is Complex</p>
<p>In recent history, from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, the Germanic and Slavic nations have continuously fought on both sides. Now that Germany has failed, it has now become an issue between the Pan-Slavic nations and the Anglo-Saxon and Latin nations, and has fallen into fierce struggles.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of the war against Germany, the United Nations has established a committee. In the future, the handling of war criminals and prisoners by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as well as the so-called industrial, cultural, and economic guidance, will gradually expose their opinions.</p>
<p>If we shift our focus and observe China, which is located in East Asia, the opposition between Yan'an and the Chongqing government is caused by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, just like in Europe.</p>
<p>As for the Near East and the Balkans, after years of the spread of the World War, the ties and equilibrium effects of the various small and weak countries need to be reorganized, so the confrontation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in this issue will become more profound.</p>
<p>Regarding the common goal of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to defeat Germany, although they claim to cooperate with each other, in the future, a confrontational situation will be formed in the division of the world. Today's world is based on profit, so we have to consider the international situation in the future.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Serious Problem of Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>Commodity prices in this city have soared again in the past few days, and the lives of citizens are suffering a very serious threat. The relevant authorities really need to swiftly devise appropriate emergency measures.</p>
<p>We observe that there are several points regarding the recent rise in commodity prices in this city that are worth special attention: First, in terms of the cyclical rise in commodity prices. Although prices have been severe in the past few years, the period of the rising cycle has been either half a year or a seasonal increase, corresponding to the natural increase in currency. However, since the second half of last year, the situation has gradually become abnormal, and the distance between cycles has become closer and closer. Since the rising tide in February of this year, it has intensified, and a new high has appeared in less than two months. Unexpectedly, since the financial market turmoil in the middle of last month, a new surge has occurred again in one month; the relative period of stability has become shorter and shorter, so it is expected that the rising tide will continue unabated in the future.</p>
<p>Second, observing the recent several rounds of price increases, they have the above-mentioned characteristics, which are obviously not the direct result of currency inflation. The most noteworthy thing is that each rising tide is related to the international and domestic situation. We only need to briefly recall the international and domestic events at the beginning of last month to observe the rising tide in the middle of last month; then look at the international events at the beginning of this month to observe the new rising tide that began in the middle of this month, and we can fully understand that there are obvious signs that large speculators are taking advantage of the people's sense of unease and engaging in activities. If this is not addressed, there will be no day of stability in the market and society in the future.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that this price increase is different from the previous ones. For example, the fluctuation in the middle of last month was triggered by the crazy jump in gold bars and stocks, and the financial market at the end of mid-April subsided due to the emergency measures taken by the authorities, but soon the rise in the market for daily necessities followed. This time, the price of gold has been temporarily stabilized by the issuance of gold securities; the market has not experienced major waves due to the crackdown on informal transactions; and the new rising tide of daily necessities has been entirely triggered by the surge in rice prices.</p>
<p>In summary, we can obtain the following concepts: First, this rising trend has followed the previous one almost immediately and is not entirely due to currency inflation; but at least it shows that although the issuance of gold securities has been successful, it has not been effective in withdrawing currency and stabilizing prices. Second, how to stabilize people's hearts and crack down on speculation, although it is an old saying, is still one of the most important parts of the price countermeasure; and economic police and other appropriate measures must not be relaxed in the slightest. Third, emergency measures should be taken for commodities and their prices that are sufficient to have a leading effect on price increases.</p>
<p>Regarding currency inflation, although the authorities have repeatedly declared it, we also believe it is the main reason for the recent rise in commodity prices. However, the public's lack of confidence in currency value requires obvious reforms to the authorities' past currency policies. Some people say that the recent lack of cash has caused considerable panic, so there is no need to contract the currency supply. This kind of argument that only sees the leaves and not the forest has no value. It must be known that the so-called lack of cash is artificial and is often a signal of new inflation, which everyone can see; and the most serious thing is that at a time when cash is scarce, credit currency suddenly expands, and banks and money shops issue a large number of notes that exceed actual needs, which is tantamount to helping the government accelerate currency inflation, so it is necessary to quickly devise appropriate countermeasures. In addition, we believe that it is necessary to effectively stabilize currency value and stabilize people's hearts. This is also the most effective countermeasure against the activities of speculators.</p>
<p>This time, the leader of the new wave of price increases is the jump in rice prices; and although this jump in rice prices is inevitably affected by speculators' manipulation and vendors' bidding, the main reason is actually the high rice prices in other ports, especially in Hangzhou and other places; This has resulted in a shortage of rice in the city. Therefore, we hope: First, that officials and the people will cooperate to dredge up sources of rice and prevent hoarding; Second, continue to hold down price rice to meet immediate needs; Third, restore household rice as much as possible, or at least distribute household food grains as soon as possible. If these three things are done or only part of them are done, at least the price of rice in this city and even the general price of commodities can be stabilized.</p>
<p>Of course, these are just emergency countermeasures. Fundamentally, as the Continental New Daily mentioned on the 18th, we must find ways to revive industry and dredge up sources of materials, solve the problems of coal, raw materials, and electricity for industrial use, and dredge up transportation, and ban illegal tax collection, etc. However, these methods are still not urgent enough today, so we should use this as a preparation for the fundamental treatment and first implement the above-mentioned emergency countermeasures to treat the symptoms. At the same time, how to adopt economic controls that are suitable for national conditions and improve all the technologies of economic controls, quickly adapt to the requirements of the new era, and make decisive measures to refresh the ears and eyes of the people, and can also achieve a real effect in stabilizing people's hearts and preventing speculation.</p>

The illegal behavior of black hats in the Huazhong Railway still exists. What countermeasures does the Ministry have? Answer: The Ministry has tried to improve the situation and is still actively seeking improvement. In the future, if we can eliminate black hats and illegal behavior, military law may be used to punish them, which may slightly kill this trend. The management of telephone communications in Nanjing. Because the telephones are often damaged for no reason, such as the illegal extortion of repair personnel, what countermeasures does the Ministry have in this regard? Answer: The Ministry has been working hard to rectify telephone communications. In the future, in addition to ordering the company to actively rectify the situation, we also hope that users will cooperate with the authorities. If unscrupulous employees commit extortion or other offenses, they should immediately report to the authorities so that they can be punished according to law.

<h3>Dispute Over Territorial Issues, Southern Country Sends Diplomatic Note to the US, US Undersecretary of State Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 21st - According to news received here: The US State Department received a document from the Yugoslav government a few days ago requesting the right to manage Trieste and the surrounding areas. US Undersecretary of State Grewte met with a group of reporters in Washington on Saturday and made the following statement. The contents of the document included a request by the Southern government for territorial changes and re-division, and a proposal to find a way to resolve the disagreement that suddenly arose between Southern personnel and the US Acting Secretary of State on May 12. Grewte also said that the US government should not use military occupation to resolve territorial disputes. Instead, it should adopt a method of reorganizing the allocation of territory to resolve the issue. However, the "patriotic elements" in the South intend to forcibly seize power and manage the area, which affects the US commander in the area's ability to maintain order or carry out the important task entrusted to him by the US government to govern the area and handle various issues after the occupation of Austria. The US government is currently discussing this difficult issue with other governments.</p>
<p>Southern Army Retreats from Carinthia</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 21st - According to a report from United Press International citing diplomatic sources in London: Yugoslav troops have withdrawn from Carinthia in southern Austria. This news has alleviated the serious situation caused by the occupation of areas such as Trieste.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berne, 21st - According to news from Paris: Authorities in Paris announced on Monday that the UK and the US are now forcibly suppressing France's immediate withdrawal of French troops deep into the Italian border, and at the same time, they have requested the government of the Southern country to withdraw the Southern troops from Trieste and its surrounding areas.</p>

The Soviet government has not yet issued a formal opinion on the Trieste issue. According to a report from Moscow, the Soviet government newspaper "News" published an interview with the Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Gordier on the 19th, which detailed the Southern country's claims on the issue and expressed support for its attitude.</p>

<h3>True Ru Today</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cheng</p>
<p>Ruined Walls and Broken Walls</p>
<p>Returning from the Jiading Nanxiang area and passing through Zhenru, I paid a visit. At the beginning of entering the town, the first thing that comes into view is some broken brick walls, standing firmly at the end of the city. These are the ruins of the war that year and appear very desolate. Most of the shops on both sides of the main street are grain stores. After crossing a small wooden bridge—Xianghua Bridge—you can see an old archway. Further ahead is a magnificent ancient temple—Wanshou Temple. According to local people, it was built in the Ming Dynasty and is several hundred years old. Judging from the antiques stored in the temple, the speculation is correct. For example, in the first hall, there sits a smiling Maitreya Buddha, made of bronze, with the eight characters "Made in March of the Yiyou Year of the Great Ming Dynasty" engraved on the back. Next to an iron incense burner in the hall, the words "Thirty-seventh Year of Qianlong" are also engraved. The second hall is the Great Hall of Heroes, about two zhang high. In addition to the complete Tathagata Buddha and several broken Arhats, nothing else remains. According to the elders of the local area, the source of the town's name "Zhenru" lies in this, because the Tathagata Buddha is molded very realistically, so everyone said: "Like a real Tathagata Buddha," and at that time it was named "Zhenru", and later it was changed to "Zhenru".</p>
<p>In the Luban Hall next to the main hall, various gamblers gathered, gambling openly in broad daylight, and no one interfered.</p>
<p>The organization of the town office is very simple, with only one town head and one staff member. In terms of security, when there were police stationed in the past, robbery cases often occurred, but now it is very peaceful. However, there are at least one or two petty theft cases every night, and most of these people are opium addicts without jobs.</p>
<p>The liveliest market in Zhenru is the vegetable market in the morning, because the local fields are planted with vegetables, and not a single grain of rice is produced, so it is completely dependent on the Nanxiang area, which is transported by vendors, and the price is of course high. Except for vegetables and rice, most commodity prices are 20% higher than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Education and Medicine</p>
<p>Education was very developed in the past, but after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the school buildings of various schools were all turned into ruins, so that singing and music were interrupted; later, although there were one or two enthusiastic people who were preparing to set up schools to remedy the situation, but because of the simple and crude conditions, it was impossible to expand; therefore, Li Peisheng and others, through various difficulties, founded Zhenguang Elementary School in January of the 32nd year, and the opening expenses were all obtained from donations from fellow villagers in Shanghai, and the regular expenses were all dependent on tuition income, with 80% of the tuition used for teachers' salaries and the remainder used for office expenses. The tuition fees charged were also lower than those of other schools, only the price of a bucket of rice, and there are currently 325 students. There are also free places for poor children.</p>
<p>In terms of local medicine, there is practically no equipment except for one or two private clinics. Therefore, every summer, when epidemics breed, one feels helpless. The enthusiastic people of the town have therefore organized a free medical clinic, which has been running for four sessions and has achieved excellent results. Each session saves more than 3,000 civilians. The expenses and medicines are all donated by various sectors. At the end of each session, the deficit is compensated by the Zhenguang Elementary School's charity ball games, with the proceeds from the ticket sales used to compensate the expenses. Since its establishment, it has been praised by people from all walks of life for its sound organization and clear accounts. This year, prices have soared and funds are not available, and we hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously.</p>

<h3>Civil Defense Headquarters to Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Starting Next Month, Adding Air Raid Shelters and Increasing Self-Flowing Wells</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen air defense facilities, the Civil Defense Headquarters will hold a "Strengthening Air Defense Facilities" campaign from June 1 to 9. The main points are: Add small air raid shelters: The working office of the headquarters will open eight small air raid shelters in various parts of the city for people to visit and arouse the public to imitate the opening of shelters. At the same time, large air raid shelters that have been built will be sorted out, modified, and improved. Organize water storage ponds. Add self-flowing wells, call on the public to open drinking water wells, which can not only cope with air defense water, but also use the well water as a beverage. Organize an inspection team to send personnel to organize a household-by-household survey: (A) Fire extinguishing equipment (B) Work equipment (C) First aid supplies (D) Equipment for lighting control and other air defense facilities. Those with perfect facilities will be rewarded, and those with inadequate facilities will be corrected in order to thoroughly strengthen air defense facilities.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast Prevention Measures: In order to enable the citizens of Shanghai to respond calmly when enemy planes are found to be attacking, the Shanghai Radio Station and the Da Dong Radio Station, in accordance with the instructions of the air defense authorities, will recently broadcast various preparations that should be made in air defense, such as the discovery that enemy planes will invade Shanghai, or the absence of enemy planes around Shanghai, as well as air defense activities, in both Chinese and Japanese languages. All self-defense corps instructors in the city must listen at any time, follow the instructions, and act quickly to respond to enemy air raid prevention measures and implement evacuation in order to avoid temporary confusion. Therefore, citizens must step up preparations. It has been found that in the Allied country of Japan, when an air raid occurs, the movements of enemy planes will be broadcast by radio, so that citizens can respond calmly, which not only does not hinder production, but also reduces the number of injured. Therefore, broadcasting the news of enemy plane movements is an urgent need, and the above-mentioned two radio stations in the city are now preparing for it.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Allied Navy Day, Regular Lecture Meeting to be Held, Shanghai Branch of the News Association to Host</h3>
<p>In order to commemorate the 40th Navy Day of the Allied country of Japan, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association will hold a lecture meeting at the Da Guangming Theater at 5 p.m. on the 26th of this month. The meeting will be given by the Minister of Naval Information Matsushima, and the China Film Studio's famous film "Thousands of Households Renewed" will be shown. A lecture meeting will be held at the Da Hua Theater at 10 a.m. on the 27th of this month. Principal Jiang of the Central Naval Academy will give a lecture, and the China Film Studio's new film "Don't Forget Tonight" will be shown. Middle school, university, and vocational school students in the city who wish to attend the lecture must prepare an official letter with the school seal, stating the number of people planning to attend the lecture and the date (26 or 27), and submit it to the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association at 160 Da Shanghai Road before 5 p.m. today (22). After the association has completed the statistics, it will issue seating tickets and publish a notice for collection.</p>
<h3>Second Issue of Gold Certificates Begins Issuance Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the listing price for the second issue of gold certificates was determined to be 8.3 million yuan per tael, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank continued its issuance yesterday (the 21st) until the 23rd. Local banks, money shops, and citizens continued to enthusiastically purchase them. Due to the continued issuance of gold certificates, idle capital is gradually concentrating on gold certificates. Consequently, trading in the black market and public debt/Chinese stocks is sluggish, and market conditions are becoming more stable. The speculative atmosphere has visibly subsided.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Adjusts License Fees for Pawnshops</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau, based on a joint petition from the pawnshop associations, requested an adjustment to the pawn tax to equalize the burden. After investigation, the bureau's method of collecting pawn taxes stipulated that, before the concessions were recovered, the old city area was taxed based on total capital. Later, this pawn tax was changed to a business license fee. Because the fees have increased year by year, pawnshops were taxed at 12 per mille and loan businesses at 50 per mille. In contrast, the former public and French concessions levied taxes based on capital or working capital (i.e., rolling capital), which was considered harsh. No adjustments were made after the concessions were recovered. The Finance Bureau believes there is a genuine need to adapt to the current situation and re-adjust the fees. Starting this spring, the old license fee rates will be calculated based on the total capital of each member, divided into five levels. Those with capital of 1 million yuan or more will be classified as Grade A, with a quarterly fee of 10,000 yuan. Capital between 700,000 yuan and 1 million yuan will be classified as Grade B, with a quarterly fee of 9,000 yuan. Capital between 410,000 yuan and 700,000 yuan will be classified as Grade C, with a quarterly fee of 7,000 yuan. Capital between 210,000 yuan and 400,000 yuan will be classified as Grade D, with a quarterly fee of 5,000 yuan. Those with capital under 200,000 yuan will be classified as Grade E, with a quarterly fee of 4,000 yuan. The capital registration certificate issued by the Bureau of Economy will be used as the standard for determining the grade. The plan will be implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval through the Bureau of Economy.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Resumes Shipping on All Lines, Strict Crackdown on Black Market Tickets</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this city recognizes the importance of shipping on all its lines. It is actively working to clear the routes, and all originally scheduled routes have now fully resumed service.

<h3>Yaorao Road Fire Relief Fund, Hoping for a Final Contribution from All Circles</h3>
<p>The fire on Yaorao Road in this city has caused severe disaster, as reported previously. This office initiated the collection of donations on the 16th for relief services, with a one-week limit. In recent days, we have received enthusiastic contributions from people of all circles, and the donations have been pouring in. Although it rained all day yesterday, those sending donations continued to stream in, demonstrating the enthusiasm of all circles for the victims. This office is deeply moved. Today is the last day for collecting relief donations. We respectfully hope that all circles will continue their efforts, demonstrate their spirit of compassion, and make every final effort to increase the amount of donations, making the results more significant, so as to thoroughly solve the plight of the affected compatriots. We eagerly await this!</p>
<p>The South Tonglu Middle School Council Distributes Rice to Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The South Tonglu Middle School Council, in response to the thousands of homeless compatriots displaced by the fires on Yaorao Road and Xiaoshadu Road, who have no home to return to and are exposed to the elements, has decided to distribute rice to disaster victims, which is too sad to be observed. In addition to sending personnel to fight, the council, with the support of enthusiastic benefactors, plans to temporarily issue 4 jin (斤) of white rice and 4 jin of red beans per person for relief. Registration will begin today in separate locations. For Yaorao Road, registration can be done at the Yaorao Road branch; for Xiaoshadu Road, registration can be done at the general headquarters at 1275 Changshou Road (i.e., Robison Road). Those registered at both locations will be issued rice in order at the general headquarters starting on the 24th and 26th respectively. We hope that all disaster victims will register promptly to avoid missing out.</p>

<p>Donations in Commemoration of Turning Over a New Leaf</p>
<p>High school student Xia Zhiheng came and said: "I am a high school student. Although my parents are not very wealthy, they can still barely afford my tuition. But I cannot earnestly and diligently study books. Thinking of the pain of poor students who want to study but cannot afford to, I cannot help but feel ashamed. From now on, I want to resolve to change my ways and strive for knowledge. I am specially sending 4,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan for scholarship funds and 2,000 yuan for the Yaorao Road fire relief, as a commemoration of turning over a new leaf."</p>
