<h3>日東鄉外相昨宣布　日德義條約失效　應付國際時局採取新施策</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　網希特勒元首擔負德國興亡重責之社尼資政權，巳頒佈命令，命德陸海空軍無條件向英美法蘇四國投降，經數年長期之歐戰，於茲乃告終結，德國遂爲英美蘇軍政府所支配。北義方面之德軍及義軍，亦於五月二日無條件投降於反軸心軍﹐義法西斯共和國遂亦消滅。於此種情形下﹐日德義三國間締結之各種條約，及與此關聯之日本與德國及其他歐洲各國間規定特殊關係之各條件，自當失其效力，故日東鄉外相十五日於常例閣議席上，就此加以說明﹐並於午後二時晋宮拜謁天皇陛下申奏終了後，午後四時邀德駐日大使史塔瑪至外相官邸，通告日本政府對因時局所採取之新施策，且以日外務省當局之談話。說明日政府與德國及其他歐洲各國間之條約已失却效力。茲誌日外務省關於日政府與德國及其他歐洲各國間之條約失效嚴明如次：</p>
<p>「日本政府因德國無條件投降，且鍳於歐洲最近各種發生之情勢﹐認爲昭和十六年十二月十一日締結之日德義三國協定，及昭和十五年九月二十七日締結之日德義三國條約，並日政府與德國及其他歐洲各國所規定之特殊協力關係之各種條約，已失去效能」。</p>
<h3>失效條約　計十一件</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日德義三國關係條約中，其核心爲昭和十五年九月二十七日所訂立之三國條約，及昭和十六年十二月十一日訂立之三國協定。三國條約內容規定共同協力建設東亞秩序，以日德義爲簽署國，嗣後則洪牙利·羅馬尼亞·斯洛伐克·保加利亞等國參加。又三國協定規定日德義三國在對英美戰爭中，不得單獨媾和，然德元首希特勒陣亡後，德國形勢急轉直下，義大利法西斯共和政府因統帥墨索里尼等首腦或被處死刑或被逮捕而告消滅，又洪·羅·斯·保等各國，亦與日本絕交﹐故從任何觀點視之，與此等歐洲各國之條約關係，不得不斷定巳究全失效。又以日德義三國簽署國之防共協定，因前年六月六日共產第三國際解散，該協定事實上亦已失效。所有失效之條約，計關於政治者二，關於經濟者二，關於文化者四，關於防共者三，共計十一件。關於政治者，　日德義三國條約（昭和十五年九月二十七日訂），　日德義協定（昭和十六年十二月十一日訂）。關於經濟者，　日德經濟協力之協定（昭和十八年一月二十日訂），　日義經濟協力協定（昭和十八年一月二十日訂）。關於文化者，　日本洪牙利友好文化協力條約（昭和十三年十一月十五日訂），　日德文化協力協定（昭和十三年十一月二十五日訂），　日義文化協力協定（昭和十四年三月二十三日訂），　日本保加利亞友好及文化協力條約（昭和十八年二月十一日訂）。關於防共者，　日德義防共協定（昭和十一年十一月二十五日訂），　日德義防共議定盡（昭和十二年十一月六日訂），　日德義防共協定效力延長議定書（昭和十六年十一月二十五日訂）。</p>
<h3>日各省政次　人選發表</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　鈴木內閣自成立後，決定沿襲政務官制度，頃與大日本政治會進行接洽，而於十五日閣議正式決定。下午三時曾發表如次﹕任十爵伊東二郎丸爲外務政務次官，任窪井義道爲內務政務次官，任中村三之丞爲大藏政務次官，任小山拜太郎爲陸軍政務次官，任綾部太郎爲海軍政務次官﹐任伯爵橋本實斐爲文部政務次官，任三善信房爲厚生政務次官，任豐田收爲大東亞政務次官，任上田幸吉爲農商　務次官，任野田武夫爲軍需政務次官，任眞鍋儀十爲運輸通信政務次官。</p>
<h3>谷大使　返國述職</h3>
<p>束京十五日中央社電　日駐華大使谷正之，爲返國述戰，於十四日下午二時搭機飛返東京。</p>
<p>日政府設置戰災復興部</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　日政府爲適應苛烈戰局﹐徹底實行關於復興戰災及援護各施第·決定在綜合計　局內設置戰災復興部。</p>
<h3>九州東南海面　沉毀敵艦五艘　日神風隊獲煊赫戰果</h3>
<p>九州十五日中央社電　日神風特攻隊十四日對接近東南海面之敵機動部隊反覆襲擊，迄今業已查明戰果，計擊沉或擊毀航空母艦二艘·戰艦一艘·艦種不詳者二艘。十四日來襲九州各地之敵艦載機，總數計六百六十八架，因日制空部隊及高射砲隊勇猛邀擊，獲得擊落十五架，擊毀十餘架之戰果，敵之企圖完全受挫，日方損害極爲輕微。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　據福岡電﹕接近九州東南方海面約一百五十公里之敵機動部隊，以來襲機數估計其勢力，則正規空母搭載八十至一百架，特設空母三十至五十架。十三日來襲機累計九百架，分三次出動，故實際出動者大約爲三百架，掩護機與出擊　略上同。根據此計算，推測敵勢力五百至六百架，係由正規空母二艘·特設空母二艘·編成兩機動部隊。</p>
<p>敵機行施謀略轟炸　東京十五日中央社電　十二日下午八時至十三日上午八時，沖繩基地之巨人F6F型機及少數燕式艦載機約三十餘架，來襲鹿兒島·宮崎·長崎各縣，混用搜下炸彈燒夷　後還去。此次來襲之目的，似在偵察日方航空基地，爲敵機動部隊艦載機大舉來襲九州之前哨行動。果不出所料，上午六時由琉球羣島西方海面北上，接近九州扳海之新編敵機動部隊，首以艦載機約八十架來襲鹿兒島·宮崎各縣後，復以大編隊波狀攻擊南部地區之日方航空基地，其後B29型機數架，反覆來襲，於下午六時許退去，其來襲機數累計九百架。敵曾於三月十八日以艦戰機大舉來襲南九州，此次爲第二次大規模空襲﹐此次敵機來襲之目的，因恐懼日軍特攻隊之　撞攻擊，企圖先行制壓特攻隊之出動，藉期打開沖繩作戰之僵局。在德國無條件投降後之　日，美總紡特魯曼曾向全美廣播稱﹐歐洲已獲勝利，而東方不得落後，在未獲最後勝利前，尤應各盡職責，故定五月十三日為進攻日本新　日，以期鼓勵國民戰意。十三日敵機空製，正爲特魯曼之所謂祈禱日，故此次來製包含若干　略意岡，敵方企圖依然在破壞日方航空基地，同時敵機動部隊愈接近日本太土，則損害愈多，此固毋庸贅言者。</p>
<h3>敵機分襲　高雄台中</h3>
<p>台北十五日中央社電　十四日白晝，自菲島基地起飛之敵轟炸機約六十架，戰鬥機十餘架數次來襲，大部份襲高雄地區，一部襲台中附近。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>疏散與反疏散</h3>
<p>本報對於市區人口疏散問題，曾經再三論列，良以時局之演變，爲避免不必要之損害，及減輕生活負祖計，皆非急謀實現疏散計劃不可。可是﹐在目前疏散人口聲中，却有捐反之嚴重現象發現，就是近滬各城　人口有向上海反疏散之事實。我們屢曾指出，上海爲一特殊地域，往往易被人誤認爲安樂奮及淘金城﹐故言人口疏散，消極的必先做到制止市外居民移居市內。而鑒於過去香港等處疏散政策成功之原因，對於入口限制辦法，實有斟酌採行之必要。我們曾於本年二月十五日社評中貢獻意見數點，但當時各方面對於此種主張，也許認爲無足輕重。然而數月以來，市區人口之疏散者爲數極少﹐而附近各城鎭居民之遷滬者反有激增之勢，這種現象，殊與疏散政策背道而馳。</p>
<p>附近城鎭居民之向滬「反疏散」﹐其原因不外三點﹕　各地治安不靖，　上海有各種享樂設施，足以引誘各地有產者如蠅之趨　，　上海有各種投機市塲，所謂「目險家的樂圍」，亦爲人口集中的原因。</p>
<p>然而由於上海人口的過多，由於四周居民之向上海「反疏散」，遂使上海的社會經濟問題愈趨嚴重。第一，由於時局的演變﹐上海決不能保證爲太平地區，這是非常明顯的﹔一且戰事逼近，敵機空製頻繁，則人口集結如此，其損害尤有不堪設想者。第二，由於電力及燃料的缺乏﹐運輸交通的困難，上海已成爲生產停滯的城市。過去上海尚能容納五百萬左右的人口者，全靠它是一個工桀都市，工業生產發達，故工商各業繁榮，而農村物資亦交流不竭，可是現在上海已不是這樣的城市，生產停　。失業者與口俱增﹐一日對外交通阻礙，食糧來源斷絕，社會危機可立而待。</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下，疏散市民，實爲迫不可緩之舉。針對現實，今日之疏散政策，第一步必須由有關當局，立刻頒發禁止外埠非必要人口入境辦法﹐而對於一般旅客之入境者亦　限制其逗留本市之期間。庶幾入境人口才有限制，而本市人口疏散始有奏效可能。同時，上海附近蘇浙皖三省當局及各縣市地方當局，亦須與本市密切合作﹐對於居民之赴滬者加以必要的限制。</p>
<p>第二，就本市人口疏散而論，發動以來，成效殊微，推究原因，首爲交通運輸不便﹐多數交通機關﹐若輪船公司乃至有干國營公營機關，但求經營事業之盈利，而不知本身對國家對戰爭所負之重大使命。各該機關之當局，對於本市人口疏散委員會﹐表面上雖允協力，按諸實際，徒成話柄而已。此種態度若不根本改變，則可爲本市人口疏散計劃最大之障礙。所以我們今日特別希望水陸交通機關的主持者，能够改變只求營利的方針，每星期至少特闢疏散專輪或專車一次，切實協助本市人口疏散。在目前正當　極推進疏散人口的計劃聲中﹐對於外埠人口反向上海移來之專實，實有注意糾正之必要，否則本市人口尚未疏散，而各地居民紛紛移人﹐人口總數反見增多，前途危險，更不堪設想。</p>
<p>沖繩決戰</p>
<h3>敵美受創沉重　正待補充兵力</h3>
<p>將達嚴高潮的冲繩決戰，依然因天氣變幻莫測，日軍的猛攻亦受相富影響。敵美於此時期，力圖補充其業已消耗的兵力，以冲繩島爲中心，其機動部隊艦船羣正盡其全力蠶動中。茲就客觀的情勢﹐一察敵美最近對於沖繩決戰的態度。</p>
<p>沖繩島中北兩飛行塲的整頓擴充，在艦上機減少之時，為其最大急務，故敵方雖高乎船舶不足，仍自各方面盡力動員，拼命補充之。</p>
<p>敵機動部隊極度畏　日軍特攻隊攻擊，雖會一度接近種子島，旋則還至沖繩東方，在台　與九州間相等距離的地點行動，並嚴密戒備日軍航空部隊的猛攻。</p>
<p>敵美會對大東島再三加以艦砲射擊﹐此因該島從腹背威脅其海上部隊，故擬排除之。</p>
<p>B24型·B29型·P51型的空襲九州﹐在於補救其機動部隊的力量不足，同時企圖打擊日軍猛攻其機動部隊的根據，目下情况依然如昔，唯空襲包含本島在內的羣島線各處的敵機數目，最近除四月廿四日　六十架外，其餘累計總在三·四百架，其中半數爲陸上　。</p>
<p>是以敵美雖因消耗巨大而在作戰上遭遇重大阻　﹐但其補充力依然不可輕視。據敵方發表，其首腦將領如太平洋艦隊司令尼米資元帥·第五艦隊司令斯普魯安斯上將·水陸兩用部隊指揮官泰納·第十軍司令巴克那等，曾在沖繩島上集議。四月廿三日尼米資於關島司令部接見記者團時，强調下列四點稱：</p>
<p>歐戰旣告結束，希望挪用該方面的兵力於平洋戰爭。</p>
<p>希望從歐洲調來B24·B17型；而不沉航空基地的確保，尤為重要。</p>
<p>沖繩之戰，為從來戰鬥中最困難者，就中日本特攻隊的活躍更屬非常可怕的威脅，今後隨　局的演進，將更厲書。</p>
<p>欲便利中國沿岸，日本本土的進攻作戰，唯有控制沖繩。</p>
<p>但實際上，該次集會所討論的事項，大約不外乎下列各點，即：及艦船羣，　有效而　動的使用之，其具體方案如何。</p>
<p>從歐洲抽調兵力，希望殊少，以此為前提，應如何催促本法案。</p>
<p>如何對付日軍特攻隊案。</p>
<p>敦促本國從連補充消耗的暗送秋波方案。</p>
<p>如何利用沖繩決戰，使有　於舊金山會議及其他。</p>
<p>尼米資返國公干時應如何處理案。</p>
<p>對於舊金山會議，其創造旣成事實的企圖，由於日軍連續的猛攻，業已化爲泡影。在該會揭幕前，其常套的戰略攻勢亦無値得振筆大書的事實表現出來，此點固足證明該方面敵軍所能動員的攻擊力已大不如前。不過，敵美集中於沖繩決戰塲的兵力﹐依然相當　大。此次尼米資返國的任務，諒為更加強調唯量是賴這一點，國謀擴充其補充生產力，並策劃將供給歐戰的軍火移用於太平洋，同時要求反軸心各國對太平注作戰出以具體協力的態度，一方面更謀美國北方基地對日牽制作戰的積極化，以求減輕沖繩方面的負担。</p>
<p>要之，擊滅敵美於其龐大補充力開始上昇以前，其重要性章章明甚。決戰的要　，祇有一個字，就是「力」字。（譯自四月二十六日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>冲繩南部　血戰方酣</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地十五日中央社電　沖繩南部主要戰區之攻防戰，十三日晨以來，敵軍攻擊漸次激化，尤以中部之經塚·澤祇方而及西部天久地區，雙方戰綫錯綜﹐兩軍甩盡種種手段而展開激戰。經塚·澤岻地區日軍將擁有戰車十餘輛一千五百之敵軍有力部隊，誘至陣前加以攻擊，運日之激鬥﹐士氣愈益旺盛，阻止敵進出之企圖。又天久方面少日部隊，對配置戰車數兩之敵軍約二千名加以邀襲，不讓寸步，勇戰敢鬥中，同時小波津以東之敵，亦強行向日軍陣地加以攻擊。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電　蘇聯支持下之奧地利萊那政權，十四日廣播如次：奧地利臨時政府宣言奧地利獨立，重建民主主義共和國，奧地利之三政黨代表乃簽定獨立宜言，爲保障臨時政府之公平無私，由三政黨各選一名代表爲臨時政府之閣員。按萊那政被之獨立宣言，其意義在解散一九三八年三月之德奧合邦，恢復一九二〇年之共和國憲法，然其幕後則有克里姆宮之先發制人的方策﹐此與波蘭問題相彷，將來難免糾紛。</p>

<h3>舊金山會議　已喪失重要性　松平剖長發表見解</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，松平情報部長對舊金山會議發表意見，略謂﹕此會前途謂詹，最後必告失敗無疑。其原因第一爲英美蘇與諸小國間不能融協，甚至英美兩國問亦發生對立現象。其次自歐洲戰事告十段落後，政治經濟等種種問題接踵而起。各國主要代表已不能努力於共同會議之進行，返國者絡繹於途，對於會議之重要性不無漢然視之之感。留在舊金山者無非次要人物，將來即有所決定，亦不過若干枝節問題，以維持美國之面十而已。總之，利用此會議以壓迫東亞，此目的已們從達到，反之，邀起小國之發言權，而令國際問題趨於複雜化則有之，至者美國之地位，更不能由此會議而有所提高也。</p>

<h3>大火情形</h3>
<p>本月十一日下午四時許，西區餘姚路一帶，發生空前巨大火災，計共焚去棚戶及廠戶千數百戶。事由某棚戶煮飯遺星星之火，祗以風勢甚大，遂成燎原，雖　各區消防人員及自　團員等到塲灌救，幷維持秩序，仍延　至翌長始吿熄滅，波及範調廣達里許，其損失之钜　難以數計。該處災民五千　人，無處　身，露宿街餘，哭聲悽厲，慘不忍睹，若不設法救濟，則飢餒流聞。遠其就斃，且影響社會治安，於公共衛生亦至重火。爰特發起組織臨時善後委員會，暫定辦法五項，先予着手：　死者埋葬，　傷者送醫，　分送食糧，　設法安置宿所·　資助　鄉，事急燃眉，不容稍綏，業於十一日　夜進行。惟是被災區域廣大，災民人數衆多，深　人微力薄，不克底於完成，因念救災卹貧，爲人人當盡之義務，特向各界呼　，共同協于助。</p>

<h3>餘姚路大火記詳災況慘重急待各界救濟</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>十一日下午四時許，餘姚路（舊星加坡路）第一棚戶區曾發生大火。延至次日晨九時漸吿熄滅。計燒去草棚三千餘問，工廠十餘家，　堂兩條，燒死四人，重傷七人，救火員受重傷二人。災區之廣，災民之衆，爲近年來所未有。</p>
<h3>燎原之火</h3>
<p>火者爲餘姚路北棚戶　榮子家，蔣　榮數，年四十歲；妻蔣趙氏三十五歲，在外　香　擬，家中有小孩三人，長女　英十五歲，次子八歲，最小者尙在　褓中，　英因弟妹饑餓，　在　，上　餅，一面　，一面分給他們吃，為了要火量就多　一點　，恰巧　時起風，把火刮聞，火星飛　茅　上，火就　出棚頂，當時南風大作，火灰落處，立即燃燒，從路北　到路南，　時就成了一片數十畝廣　的火海！</p>
<p>消防隊最早的一部救火趕到時，已經是五時半，　時草棚已燒去千餘間。一座常用的太平龍頭早已包在火海中了，而其他餘姚路上的四個太平能頭因年久失修，一滴水也弄不出，找來找去，最後方在金司徒廟康定路一一七一號門前，　到一個太平龍頭，可是皮帶又不够長，於是又忙着接皮帶，等各區預備的皮帶送到，時聞已躭誤了好久。</p>
<h3>火勢蔓延</h3>
<p>路南的棚戶區全都着火，火舌隨風向而擴展，均安坊四十餘家亦依次起火，延及工廠區。萬寳綢廠，三寳織綢廠，九星織造廠，龍興坊四十二幢房　，大吉化工廠，良記人造石廠，銳博電工廠，胡立興電工廠等均先後波及，沿餘桃路一八〇號至一八四號等店家亦未幸免。</p>
<p>受災者有華山區：</p>
<p>第七聯保第三保，一百四十二戶，七百三十人，保長張榮華。</p>
<p>第六聯保第二保，二百九十戶。一千九百人，保長姚育之。</p>
<p>第六聯保第五保，一百八十戶，九百日六十人，保長夏長江。</p>
<p>第　聯保第六保，二百五十戶，一千一百餘人，保長趙靖卿。</p>
<p>其中除第六聯保第二保爲弄堂房子外，餘皆爲棚戶，這些草棚全是用毛竹，蘆蓆，竹蓆，稻草等搭成，低矮，陰暗，潮濕，是它的特色。多數是　地舖，只有少數的人家才有木板床，這些房子彼此相連，一間小小的棚十就得擠五六個人，有的還一問裏合住六七家，二三十人不分老少男女的橫在一塊，落雨天就完全在泥淖中打滾。</p>
<h3>災區一瞥</h3>
<p>記者去看的時候，這些棚十已成了一堆堆的草灰，其中也雜着一些碎木屑，燒焦的破棉絮，廢鐵片，破碗片子等等，灰在飛揚　，焦臭直冲鼻子，災民全是終年赤脚的苦力，職業不外拉黃包車，抱塌軍，踏三輸車，以及各式各樣的菜販，或是附近工廠中做工的工人等等，　貫多是蘇北之　城，　寗，泰州等地，他們在家鄉大都沒有出地，回去更無法謀生，所以不論生活怎樣困難，總不會他去。</p>
<p>一堆堆黃色的新　棚，那作為支撐它的靑竹就一處處的交又着，連遠看去就如同營帳一般，走近看眞够慘　的，臨時搭的蓬低矮得只好爬進去，四面完全通天透亮，裏面好的　舖着由火中搶出的舖板，堆着一兩團黛黑的破棉絮，比較　的，就只在地上隨　一些稻草。滾稻草舖。衣被大都沒有來得及搶出來，只剩身上穿的一身千補萬綴的破掛褲，好一點的平常捨不得穿，棉　等也都和棚十一同燒掉，四天來都只好在寒冷深夜　作一團發抖，就是偕到一件夾袍　蓋也不能禦寒的。還有些就簡直把一些稱草舖在地上，完全無進無蓋的在露天下過夜·灰土·寒冷·風雨·焦臭的氣息，都在侵製他們。</p>
<h3>善後工作</h3>
<p>現在搭一間住五六個人的小棚，至少要二十多萬元。據一個棚匠　，材料至少要大竹十五根，小竹兩捆，大竹席兩張，蘆席二十張，稻草四擔·再加上鉛絲·洋釘·人工等等。但這十家之中有十家搭不起，他們現在全是買兩根小竹，三四張小蓆隨便搭一個臨時的棚居住，這種不　風雨的小棚，也要花兩三萬元，正在搭蓋中的有一間大草棚·據說是已經花了一百萬元之多。</p>
<p>這些災民幾乎完全是孑然一身，就連鍋·碗，盆·筷也燒得一無所餘，燒飯是無法可燒的，現在每天就全靠臨時的施放粥飯，饅頭來苟延殘喘，但這也不是澈底的救濟辦法。</p>
<p>災民現在迫切需要的，除金錢外，舊被頸·舊衣褲·　鞋子。鐵鍋·飯碗·鐵罐·瓦盆·筷子，以及糧食如米·苞米粉·山芋乾，小菜如蘿葡乾鹹菜等也都需要。深望各界人士能自動　將。</p>

<p>爲創導起見，本報首先捐助十萬元，另由本報陳社長捐助五萬元，以爲災區的救濟費用。各界如惠捐款，本報社會服務處即日開始代收，隨時轉交負責機關分發。</p>

<p>本站爲整飭非法職員，加以淘汰，任用新人，惟恐重蹈覆轍起見，對於今後新員工決加以嚴格管理。過去不站日籍人員，由於言语隔閡，對於中國民情，未能深切明瞭，不免有少數華籍員工利用職務上之便利，發生不端行爲，在今次嚴肅整頓下務使每一旅吝稱心便利。今從自站長以下，以及全體職員，對中國人民均予懇切接近。爲維護秩序，糾正過去之不良現象，特在車站門口，裝置木柵，規定一二三等乘客分級入內，拒絕不法歹徒及小贩等入站，故在乘客進站，當可便利匪浅。至旅客問詢處之工作，專事解決旅客一切困難，作切實之協力，由新野副站長兼任外，並設有華籍員工三人協助工作。今後如有本站員工不端行爲，隨時向本站吿發，俾根除弊端，並爲嚴格華籍員工起見，授以相當敎育，使其深切明瞭各種應有之知識。同時爲便利單身女客購票，特在售票處旁再設說二票窗，爲中國女客服務。關於過去之黃半黨橫行，魚肉旅客情事，本站實無從知悉。今派員暗査外，並希　警局負責査究，及賴乘客協力吿密，萬一本站職員有非法行爲，據證吿密，定予秉公辦理，決不寬容。第一本站對華　員工予以嚴密察査，如發現不端即予開革。</p>

        <h1>1945.05.16</h1>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Announces Yesterday: Japan-Germany-Italy Treaty Invalid; New Policies Adopted to Cope with the International Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The administration of Chancellor Hitler, who shouldered the heavy responsibility of Germany's rise and fall, has issued an order for the German army, navy, and air force to surrender unconditionally to the four nations of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The long-term European war, lasting several years, has now come to an end. Germany is now under the control of the Anglo-American-Soviet military government. The German and Italian forces in Northern Italy also surrendered unconditionally to the anti-Axis forces on May 2nd. The Italian Fascist Republic has also been eliminated. Under these circumstances, all treaties concluded between Japan, Germany, and Italy, as well as all conditions related to special relations between Japan and Germany and other European countries, must naturally become invalid. Therefore, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru explained this matter at the regular cabinet meeting on the 15th. After paying homage to His Majesty the Emperor at the palace at 2 PM and reporting the conclusion, he invited the German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, to his official residence at 4 PM to inform him of the new policies adopted by the Japanese government in response to the situation. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the treaties between the Japanese government and Germany and other European countries have lost their validity. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has clearly stated the invalidity of the treaties between the Japanese government and Germany and other European countries as follows:</p>
<p>"Due to Germany's unconditional surrender and in light of the recent developments in Europe, the Japanese government believes that the Tripartite Agreement concluded on December 11, 1941, the Tripartite Pact concluded on September 27, 1940, and all treaties stipulating special cooperative relations between the Japanese government and Germany and other European countries have lost their validity."</p>
<h3>Eleven Treaties Deemed Invalid</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Among the treaties concerning the relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the core was the Tripartite Pact concluded on September 27, 1940, and the Tripartite Agreement concluded on December 11, 1941. The Tripartite Pact stipulated joint cooperation in building a new order in East Asia, with Japan, Germany, and Italy as signatory countries, and later Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries joined. The Tripartite Agreement stipulated that Japan, Germany, and Italy would not make a separate peace in the war against Britain and the United States. However, after the death of German leader Hitler, the situation in Germany changed drastically. The Italian Fascist Republic was eliminated due to the execution or arrest of its leaders, including Mussolini. Furthermore, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries also severed relations with Japan. Therefore, from any point of view, the treaty relationships with these European countries must be considered completely invalid. Moreover, the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Japan, Germany, and Italy has also effectively become invalid due to the dissolution of the Communist Third International on June 6th of the previous year. In total, there are eleven treaties that have become invalid: two concerning politics, two concerning economy, four concerning culture, and three concerning anti-communism.

<h3>Ambassador Tani Returns to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, flew back to Tokyo on the afternoon of the 14th to report on his duties.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Establishes War Disaster Reconstruction Department</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – To adapt to the severe war situation, the Japanese government has decided to thoroughly implement measures regarding the reconstruction of war disasters and the support of various policies. It has decided to establish a War Disaster Reconstruction Department within the General Planning Bureau.</p>
<h3>Five Enemy Warships Sunk or Destroyed off the Coast of Kyushu and Southeast Seas; Japanese Kamikaze Units Achieve Glorious Results</h3>
<p>Kyushu, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force repeatedly attacked enemy mobile units approaching the Southeast Seas on the 14th. It has now been confirmed that the results of the battle include the sinking or destruction of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two warships of unknown type. A total of 668 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked various parts of Kyushu on the 14th. Due to the brave interception by the Japanese air defense units and anti-aircraft artillery units, they achieved the results of shooting down 15 aircraft and destroying more than 10 aircraft. The enemy's attempts were completely frustrated, and Japanese losses were extremely minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Fukuoka, the enemy mobile units approaching the southeast coast of Kyushu, approximately 150 kilometers away, are estimated to have a force of 80 to 100 aircraft on regular carriers and 30 to 50 aircraft on special carriers, based on the number of attacking aircraft. A total of 900 aircraft attacked on the 13th, launching in three waves, so the actual number of aircraft dispatched was approximately 300. The escort aircraft and attacking aircraft were roughly the same. Based on this calculation, it is estimated that the enemy force consists of 500 to 600 aircraft, formed by two mobile units composed of two regular carriers and two special carriers.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Carry Out Strategic Bombing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – From 8 PM on the 12th to 8 AM on the 13th, approximately 30 F6F Hellcat aircraft and a small number of Yokosuka D4Y Suisei carrier-based aircraft from the Okinawa base attacked Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Nagasaki Prefectures, indiscriminately using cluster bombs and incendiaries before returning. The purpose of this attack seemed to be to scout out Japanese air bases as a preliminary operation before a large-scale attack on Kyushu by enemy mobile carrier-based aircraft. As expected, at 6 AM, a newly formed enemy mobile unit heading north from the sea west of the Ryukyu Islands approached the Ban Sea of Kyushu and first attacked Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures with approximately 80 carrier-based aircraft. Subsequently, large-scale wave attacks were launched against Japanese air bases in the southern region. Later, several B-29 aircraft repeatedly attacked and withdrew at around 6 PM. The total number of attacking aircraft reached 900. The enemy launched a large-scale air raid on southern Kyushu with carrier-based aircraft on March 18th. This was the second large-scale air raid. The enemy's objective in this attack was to preemptively suppress the deployment of special attack units, fearing the ramming attacks of the Japanese special attack units, in an attempt to break the deadlock in the Okinawa operation. On the day after Germany's unconditional surrender, US President Truman broadcasted to the entire United States, stating that Europe had achieved victory, but the East must not lag behind. Before achieving final victory, everyone should fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, May 13th was designated as a new day for the attack on Japan to encourage national fighting spirit. The enemy's air raids on the 13th were precisely Truman's so-called "day of prayer." Therefore, this attack contained some strategic intentions. The enemy's intention remained to destroy Japanese air bases. At the same time, the closer the enemy mobile units get to mainland Japan, the more damage they will suffer, which goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Kaohsiung and Taichung</h3>
<p>Taipei, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the 14th during the day, approximately 60 enemy bombers and over ten fighters, which took off from bases in the Philippine Islands, attacked several times. Most of them attacked the Kaohsiung area, and a portion attacked the vicinity of Taichung.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Evacuation and Counter-Evacuation</h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly discussed the issue of urban population evacuation, because in order to avoid unnecessary losses and reduce the burden of living, it is imperative to implement the evacuation plan as soon as possible. However, amidst the current calls for population evacuation, a serious phenomenon of counter-evacuation has been discovered, namely the fact that the population of cities near Shanghai is counter-evacuating to Shanghai. We have repeatedly pointed out that Shanghai is a special area that is often mistakenly regarded as a land of ease and a city of gold. Therefore, in order to evacuate the population, the first step must be to prevent residents from outside the city from moving into the city. In view of the success of evacuation policies in places like Hong Kong in the past, it is necessary to carefully consider adopting measures to restrict entry. We offered several suggestions in the editorial on February 15th of this year, but at that time, various parties may have considered this suggestion to be insignificant. However, in the months since, very few urban residents have been evacuated, while the number of residents from nearby towns and cities moving to Shanghai has increased sharply. This phenomenon is contrary to the evacuation policy.</p>
<p>There are three main reasons for the "counter-evacuation" of residents from nearby towns to Shanghai: 1. Unrest in various regions; 2. Shanghai has various entertainment facilities that are sufficient to attract wealthy people from various places like flies; 3. Shanghai has various speculative markets, the so-called "playground for risk-takers," which also contributes to population concentration.</p>
<p>However, due to the excessive population in Shanghai and the "counter-evacuation" of residents from surrounding areas to Shanghai, the social and economic problems in Shanghai are becoming increasingly serious. First, due to the evolving situation, Shanghai cannot be guaranteed to be a safe area, which is very obvious. Once the war approaches and enemy air raids become frequent, such a concentration of population will cause unimaginable damage. Second, due to the lack of electricity and fuel and the difficulty of transportation, Shanghai has become a city with stagnant production. In the past, Shanghai was able to accommodate approximately five million people because it was an industrial city with developed industrial production, so commerce and industry were prosperous, and agricultural materials were constantly exchanged. However, Shanghai is no longer such a city, and production has stagnated. The number of unemployed people is increasing, and if external transportation is obstructed and food supplies are cut off, a social crisis will immediately arise.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, evacuating urban residents is an urgent and unavoidable measure. In light of the reality, the first step of today's evacuation policy must be for the relevant authorities to immediately issue measures to prohibit the entry of non-essential population from other areas, and to restrict the length of stay in the city for general travelers. Only by restricting the entry population can the evacuation of the city's population be effective. At the same time, the authorities of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui near Shanghai, as well as the local authorities of various counties and cities, must cooperate closely with the city and impose necessary restrictions on residents going to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, as far as the evacuation of the city's population is concerned, the results have been minimal since its launch. The main reason is the inconvenience of transportation. Most transportation agencies, such as shipping companies and even national and public agencies, only seek to profit from their operations and are unaware of the important mission they bear to the country and the war. Although the authorities of these agencies outwardly agree to cooperate with the city's population evacuation committee, in reality, it is just empty talk. If this attitude is not fundamentally changed, it will be the biggest obstacle to the city's population evacuation plan. Therefore, we especially hope today that the leaders of the water and land transportation agencies can change their profit-oriented policy and set aside at least one special evacuation ship or train per week to effectively assist in the evacuation of the city's population. Amidst the current calls for actively promoting the plan to evacuate the population, it is necessary to pay attention to correcting the reality of residents from other areas moving to Shanghai. Otherwise, the city's population has not yet been evacuated, and residents from various places are moving in, causing the total population to increase instead, which is fraught with danger.</p>
<p>Okinawa Decisive Battle</p>
<h3>Enemy US Suffers Heavy Damage; Awaiting Reinforcements</h3>
<p>The Okinawa decisive battle, which is reaching a severe climax, is still affected by the unpredictable weather, and the Japanese army's fierce attacks are also considerably affected. During this period, the enemy US is trying to replenish its already depleted forces, and its mobile fleet is doing its best to encircle Okinawa Island. Let us examine the enemy US's recent attitude toward the Okinawa decisive battle based on the objective situation.</p>
<p>The organization and expansion of the central and northern Okinawa airfields is its top priority at a time when ship-based aircraft are decreasing. Therefore, although the enemy is complaining about a shortage of ships, it is still doing its best to mobilize from all sides to desperately replenish them.</p>
<p>The enemy mobile fleet is extremely afraid of attacks by Japanese special attack units. Although it once approached Tanegashima, it then returned to the east of Okinawa, operating at a location equidistant between Taiwan and Kyushu, and is closely guarding against the fierce attacks of the Japanese air force.</p>
<p>The enemy US has repeatedly subjected Daito Island to naval bombardment because the island threatens its naval forces from the rear. Therefore, it intends to eliminate it.</p>
<p>The air raids on Kyushu by B-24, B-29, and P-51 aircraft are intended to compensate for the lack of strength of its mobile fleet, while attempting to strike the Japanese bases from which they launch fierce attacks on its mobile fleet. The situation remains the same. However, the number of enemy aircraft attacking the archipelago, including the main island, has been totaling 300-400 in recent days, except for 60 aircraft on April 24th. Half of them are land-based.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the enemy US has suffered heavy obstacles in combat due to enormous attrition, its replenishment power cannot be underestimated. According to the enemy's announcement, its top commanders, such as Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz, Fifth Fleet Commander Admiral Spruance, Amphibious Forces Commander Turner, and Tenth Army Commander Buckner, held a meeting on Okinawa Island. When Nimitz met with the press corps at the Guam Command on April 23rd, he emphasized the following four points:</p>
<p>1. With the end of the European war, he hopes to transfer the forces from that theater to the Pacific War.</p>
<p>2. He hopes to transfer B-24 and B-17 aircraft from Europe, and ensuring unsinkable air bases is particularly important.</p>
<p>3. The Battle of Okinawa is the most difficult battle ever, and the activity of the Japanese special attack units is an extremely terrible threat, which will become even more severe as the situation develops.</p>
<p>4. Controlling Okinawa is the only way to facilitate offensive operations along the Chinese coast and the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>But in reality, the matters discussed at that meeting were probably nothing more than the following points: 1. How to effectively and actively use ships and fleets, and what are the specific plans.</p>
<p>2. How to expedite this bill, assuming that there will be little troop withdrawal from Europe.</p>
<p>3. How to deal with the Japanese special attack units.</p>
<p>4. How to urge the country to continuously replenish its attrition.</p>
<p>5. How to use the Okinawa decisive battle to contribute to the San Francisco Conference and other things.</p>
<p>6. How to handle the case when Nimitz returns to the country on official business.</p>
<p>Its attempt to create a fait accompli for the San Francisco Conference has already been thwarted by the continuous fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Before the opening of the conference, its stereotypical strategic offensive did not show any noteworthy facts, which is enough to prove that the attacking power that the enemy can mobilize in that area is far less than before. However, the forces that the enemy US has concentrated at the Okinawa decisive battleground are still quite large. Nimitz's mission in returning to the country is likely to further emphasize the importance of relying solely on quantity, in order to expand its replenishment production capacity and plan to transfer the armaments supplied to the European war to the Pacific, while also requiring the anti-Axis countries to take a concrete cooperative attitude toward the Pacific war, and to seek to ease the burden on the Okinawa side by actively involving the American Northern base in the diversionary operation against Japan.</p>
<p>In short, it is abundantly clear that it is important to destroy the enemy US before its huge replenishment power begins to rise. The key point of the decisive battle is just one word: "strength." (Translated from the April 26th Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Southern Okinawa</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 15th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 13th, the offensive and defensive battles in the main battle area of ​​southern Okinawa have gradually intensified, especially in the areas of Kyuna, Zaki, and the western district of Ameku. The battle lines between the two sides are intertwined, and the two armies are using all kinds of means to launch fierce battles. In the areas of Kyuna and Zaki, the Japanese army lured a powerful enemy force of more than 1,500 troops with more than a dozen tanks to the front of the positions and attacked them. The fierce fighting is increasing day by day, and morale is getting higher and higher, stopping the enemy's attempt to advance. In addition, small Japanese units ambushed approximately 2,000 enemy troops with several tanks in the Ameku area, preventing them from advancing. While fighting bravely, the enemy east of Kobaru also launched a forced attack on the Japanese positions.</p>

<h3>The Entire Nation Actively Increases Production and Cooperates to Complete the War; Ambassador Chen Discusses the Current Situation in Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – National Government Commissioner and Ambassador to Manchukuo Chen Jicheng returned to the country on official business. He attended banquets held by Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Japanese Embassy and the Manchukuo Embassy in Beijing. Then he flew to Shanghai and returned to Nanjing by car on the 15th. He made the following remarks on the current situation in Manchuria: The government of Manchukuo is fully implementing national mobilization in order to conform to the intense decisive battles of the Greater East Asia War, to ensure the completion of important national defense projects, to grasp human resources, and to increase the productivity of important projects by increasing the production force of the People, actively promoting the refreshment and strengthening of the national labor service system, and to grasp material resources. Manchuria is a peasant country, and farmers across the country are fully aware of the current situation, and they get up early and sleep late, devoting themselves to increasing production. They are able to supply the amount of production designated by the central government each year. Workers in important mining departments such as iron, steel, coal, and light gold sea are working hard and do not dare to relax for a second, even during good days and festivals, they do not stop working. In short, at this time when the situation has reached a serious juncture, the government and the people of Manchukuo have recognized their own position. They have moved from the stage of supporting the war to the stage of fighting on their own. They are all standing up to face difficulties, going forward to destroy the enemy, vowing to live this decisive battle life with a special attack spirit, wanting to enrich manpower to strengthen material strength, and then use their own materials to conquer the enemy's material strength, and strive for the final victory.</p>
<h3>Austrian Provisional Government Established; Issues Declaration of Independence; U.S. Authorities Reiterate Non-Recognition</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency, 15th – The Austrian Lechner regime, backed by the Soviet Union, broadcast the following on the 14th: The Austrian provisional government declares Austrian independence and the reconstruction of a democratic republic. Representatives of Austria's three political parties signed the declaration of independence. To ensure the fairness and impartiality of the provisional government, each of the three parties will select a representative to serve as a member of the provisional government. The significance of the Lechner regime's declaration of independence lies in dissolving the German-Austrian union of March 1938 and restoring the Republic Constitution of 1920. However, behind the scenes lies the Kremlin's preemptive strategy, similar to the Polish issue, which will inevitably lead to future disputes.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 15th – Washington dispatch: U.S. Department of the Interior authorities reiterated on the 14th that they do not recognize the Austrian Lechner regime.</p>
<h3>Eden and Truman Hold Talks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 14th – Washington dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden, on his way home, arrived in Washington on the 14th and held talks with U.S. President Truman. Afterwards, he told reporters that the biggest point of contention between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the Polish issue.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen to Visit Moscow</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 15th – Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press: Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing, who participated in the San Francisco Conference, will visit Moscow on his way home. The purpose of this trip is to strengthen relations between Chongqing and the Soviet Union and to explore Soviet opinions on the Far East.</p>
<h3>Commander of U.S. Eighth Air Force Replaced</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency, 14th – Paris dispatch: The U.S. Strategic Air Force Command in France announced on the 14th that Lieutenant General Doolittle, commander of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, has been reassigned and will soon return to Washington. Major General Kepner has been appointed as his successor.</p>
<h3>San Francisco Conference Has Lost Importance; Matsudaira Elaborates on His Views</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira expressed his views on the San Francisco Conference, stating briefly: The future of this conference is bleak, and it will undoubtedly end in failure. The first reason is the inability to reconcile between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and smaller countries. Even conflicts have arisen between Britain and the United States. Secondly, since the end of the European war, various political and economic problems have emerged one after another. The main representatives of various countries are no longer able to focus on the joint progress of the conference, and those returning home are continuously on their journey. The importance of the conference is somewhat diminished. Those remaining in San Francisco are merely secondary figures. In the future, even if decisions are made, they will only concern some trivial issues to maintain the face of the United States. In summary, the aim of using this conference to suppress East Asia has not been achieved. On the contrary, it has invited the right of small countries to speak, making international issues more complicated. Moreover, the position of the United States will not be enhanced by this conference.</p>
<h3>Göring's Indictment for Crimes</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 14th – Luxembourg Radio broadcast: The War Crimes Investigation Committee will first try Marshal Göring. His crimes include the large-scale massacre of Czech students during Czech International Day in 1939, and the complete massacre of the people of Lidice.

<h3>Economic Blackout to be Strictly Enforced; Joint Punishment Will Be Adopted for Violators</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly strengthen air defense and prevent enemy aircraft from invading, the city's air defense authorities implemented a regular blackout citywide starting yesterday (the 15th). The regulations have been published in detail in various newspapers, and citizens are expected to strictly comply. It is understood that the situation last night was not perfect. It is hoped that citizens will pay close attention and work together to improve.</p>
<h3>Strict Punishment for Light Leaks</h3>
<p>It is also understood that the military and police authorities are determined to strictly enforce the regular blackout. They will dispatch personnel every night to patrol each district under their jurisdiction. Regardless of whether it is a company, firm, shop, or residence, those who violate the blackout or leak light will be severely punished. The punishment method will be the joint responsibility system. If one household leaks light, electricity will be cut off to the entire security unit or even the joint security unit. The household that leaks light will also be prosecuted in accordance with the regulations issued by the Air Defense Headquarters on July 6 of last year, for interfering with military operations and severely punished. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will monitor each other and absolutely prevent light from leaking. If there are any violations, they should be reported to the respective branch bureaus for investigation in order to avoid harming themselves.</p>
<h3>Several Districts Have Already Received Electricity Cut-Offs</h3>
<p>On the evening of the Air Defense Day on the 9th of this month, when the city implemented a blackout, the air defense authorities patrolled various districts of the city and discovered that violations of the blackout and light leaks occurred in the first sections of Nanjing Road, South Road, Guangdong Road, and Hubei Road in the Old Zhabei District, and the first sections of North Fujian Road, Haining Road, North Henan Road, and Tianliu Road in the West Hongkou District, and the first sections of Yiyang Road, Lijiang Road, Zhoujiazui Road, and Chang'an Road in the Tilanqiao District. Therefore, the above-mentioned places have been given electricity cut-offs by security unit and the power supply has been stopped from the 10th. However, even though the power has been cut off, the use of other lights must still comply with the regulations, and light must not be leaked, otherwise legal action will still be taken. This also applies to citizens who use other lights after 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Facilities to be Strengthened Next Month</h3>
<p>The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters will implement "Air Defense Facilities Strengthening Week" starting on the first of next month in order to strengthen air defense facilities. They will organize various air defense facilities and send personnel to inspect air defense facilities in various districts, security units, and even households throughout the city. Those that are not up to standard will be corrected. At the same time, because the existing air defense shelters are not sufficient, small air raid shelters for individual use will be dug starting next month, with the goal of being ubiquitous in all districts of the city.</p>
<h3>Fourth Phase of Air Defense Training Begins</h3>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Training Institute of the Civil Air Defense Headquarters held the opening ceremony for the fourth phase at the institute on Datong Road at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 15th). Chief of the Police Defense Department Hiraoka Isamu, Chief of the Fire Department Kiyote Mizumi, Deputy Chief of the Conservation Department Okawa Rinpei, and heads of various branch bureaus, chiefs of general joint security units, and more than 400 trainees attended. Hiraoka Isamu first delivered a training speech on behalf of Director Zhou, followed by speeches from various chiefs such as Kiyote Mizumi. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Fire Refugees Urgently Need Relief From All Sectors; Provisional Relief Committee Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The unprecedented fire on Yuyao Road in Shanghai West has left thousands of refugees homeless, exposed, hungry, and in a tragic state. Seventeen people from all walks of life in Shanghai West, including Yue Fengzhi, Qian Zong, Wu Songquan, Yuan Zongping, Gu Huanzhang, and Le Boming, have initiated the organization of a provisional relief committee to carry out temporary relief work to meet the urgent needs. At the same time, they have submitted requests to the municipal government and relevant welfare organizations for prompt relief. The committee announced yesterday the cause of the fire and the work being carried out, appealing to all sectors of the city to jointly assist in relieving the disaster victims. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Fire Situation</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month, a huge fire of unprecedented scale broke out in the Yuyao Road area of the western district, destroying thousands of shanties and factories. The fire started from a spark left unattended while cooking in a shanty. Due to the strong winds, it spread rapidly. Although firefighters from various districts and volunteer corps arrived to put out the fire and maintain order, it continued to burn until the next morning before it was extinguished. The affected area covered a wide range, and the losses were incalculable. The 5,000 disaster victims had nowhere to turn, were exposed on the streets, and cried out in distress. If relief measures are not taken, they will suffer from hunger and exposure. Furthermore, the impact will affect social order and public health. Therefore, a provisional relief committee was established to temporarily adopt five measures to begin with: 1. Bury the dead; 2. Send the injured to the hospital; 3. Distribute food; 4. Find temporary shelter; 5. Provide assistance for returning to their hometowns. The urgency of the situation cannot be delayed, and work began on the night of the 11th. However, the disaster area is vast, and the number of disaster victims is large. We deeply feel that our strength is limited and we cannot complete the task. Therefore, we believe that disaster relief and poverty alleviation are obligations that everyone should fulfill. We hereby appeal to all sectors to work together to assist.</p>
<h3>Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>The provisional relief committee for the Yuyao Road fire held an initiators' meeting yesterday afternoon. More than ten people, including Le Fenglin, Wu Songquan, Wang Wanqing, Xian Huanzhang, and Wu Yongping, attended. Wu Songquan chaired the meeting. In addition to reporting that the dead had been buried and the injured were being treated, the meeting discussed how to advance the work. It was resolved to prepare survey forms to investigate the exact amount of damage in order to determine relief standards, register those returning to their hometowns in order to provide assistance for returning. The meeting also discussed raising funds widely, believing that many hands make light work. The office is now located at 351 Kangding Road. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Yuyao Road Fire: Disaster Situation is Serious, Urgently Awaiting Relief from All Sectors</h3>
<p>By Jia Xi</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM on the 11th, a fire broke out in the first shanty town area of Yuyao Road (formerly Singapore Road). It gradually extinguished at 9:00 AM the next morning. It is estimated that over three thousand shanties, more than ten factories, two ancestral halls were burned down, four people were burned to death, seven were seriously injured, and two firefighters were seriously injured. The extent of the disaster area and the number of disaster victims are unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3>The Raging Fire</h3>
<p>The fire was started by Jiang Rongzi, a resident of the northern shanty town of Yuyao Road. Jiang, age 40, and his wife Jiang Zhao, age 35, were selling incense candles outside. There were three children at home: eldest daughter Ying, age 15, second son, age eight, and the youngest still in swaddling clothes. Ying, because her younger siblings were hungry, was warming a cake on the stove to feed them. To get more fire, she piled more fuel. Unfortunately, the wind rose at that time, blowing the embers onto the thatched roof. The fire broke out from the top of the shanty. At that time, the south wind was blowing hard, and wherever the ash fell, it immediately ignited. From the north side of the road to the south, it immediately turned into a fiery sea spanning tens of acres!</p>
<p>The first fire truck arrived at 5:30 PM, but by then more than a thousand shanties had already burned down. A commonly used water dragon head was already engulfed in the sea of fire. The other four water dragon heads on Yuyao Road were in disrepair and could not produce a drop of water. After searching and searching, they finally found a water dragon head in front of the gate of 1171 Kangding Road at Jin Situ Temple. However, the hose was not long enough, so they were busy connecting hoses. By the time the hoses prepared by various districts were delivered, a lot of time had already been lost.</p>
<h3>The Fire Spreads</h3>
<p>The shanty town area on the south side of the road was all on fire. The flames spread with the wind, and more than forty houses in Jun'an Lane caught fire in turn, extending to the factory area. Wanbao Silk Factory, Sanbao Silk Weaving Factory, Jiuxing Weaving Factory, 42 buildings in Longxing Lane, Daji Chemical Factory, Liangji Artificial Stone Factory, Ruibo Electrical Factory, and Hu Lixing Electrical Factory were all affected one after another. The shops along 180 to 184 Yuyao Road were also not spared.</p>
<p>The affected areas are in the Huashan District:</p>
<p>Third Block of the Seventh Joint Security Unit, 142 households, 730 people, Block Leader Zhang Ronghua.</p>
<p>Second Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, 290 households, 1,900 people, Block Leader Yao Yuzhi.</p>
<p>Fifth Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, 180 households, 960 people, Block Leader Xia Changjiang.</p>
<p>Sixth Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, 250 households, 1,100 people, Block Leader Zhao Jingqing.</p>
<p>Except for the Second Block of the Sixth Joint Security Unit, which are alleyway houses, the rest are shanties. These shanties are all built with bamboo, reed mats, bamboo mats, and straw. They are low, dark, and damp. Most people sleep on the ground. Only a few families have wooden beds. These houses are connected to each other, and five or six people have to squeeze into a small shanty, or even six or seven families, with twenty or thirty people, old and young, male and female, lying together. When it rains, they roll around completely in the mud.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Disaster Area</h3>
<p>When the reporter visited, these shanties had become piles of straw ashes, mixed with some wood chips, charred cotton wadding, scrap iron, broken pottery shards, etc. The ashes were flying, and the stench went straight to the nose. The disaster victims are all coolies who are barefoot all year round, whose occupations are nothing more than pulling rickshaws, carrying sedan chairs, pedaling tricycles, and various vegetable vendors, or workers working in nearby factories, most of whom are from Su Bei, Sucheng, Jianning, Taizhou, and other places. Most of them have no land in their hometowns and cannot make a living if they return, so no matter how difficult life is, they will never leave.</p>
<p>Piles of yellow new shacks, with green bamboo intertwined to support them, look like camps from a distance. Getting closer, it is truly miserable. The temporary sheds are so low that you can only crawl in. They are completely open to the sky. Inside, the good ones are paved with boards salvaged from the fire, piled with one or two clumps of black cotton wadding. The worse ones just scatter some straw on the ground. The clothes and bedding were mostly not rescued, leaving only the torn and patched pants worn on their bodies. The better ones that were usually reluctant to wear, the cotton quilts, etc., were also burned along with the shanties. For the past four days, they have had to huddle together and shiver in the cold of the night. Even if they could find a lined robe to cover themselves, it would not be enough to keep warm. Some simply put some straw on the ground and spent the night in the open air completely without cover. Ash, cold, wind, rain, and the smell of burning were all affecting them.</p>
<h3>Relief Work</h3>
<p>Now, it costs at least 200,000 yuan to build a small shed for five or six people to live in. According to a shanty builder, the materials require at least 15 large bamboo poles, two bundles of small bamboo poles, two large bamboo mats, 20 reed mats, and four bundles of straw, plus lead wire, nails, labor, etc. But ten out of ten families cannot afford it. They are now all buying two small bamboo poles and three or four small mats to build a temporary shed to live in. These small sheds that cannot withstand wind and rain also cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. There is a large straw shed under construction, which is said to have already cost more than one million yuan.</p>
<p>These disaster victims are almost completely penniless, and even pots, bowls, basins, and chopsticks have been burned to nothing. It is impossible to cook. Now they all rely on temporary handouts of porridge and steamed buns to barely survive, but this is not a thorough solution.</p>
<p>The disaster victims urgently need, in addition to money, old quilts, old clothes, shoes, iron pots, rice bowls, iron cans, earthenware basins, chopsticks, and food such as rice, corn flour, dried sweet potatoes, and side dishes such as dried radish and pickles. It is hoped that people from all walks of life can donate generously.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Receives Donations on Behalf</h3>
<p>To lead by example, our newspaper first donates 100,000 yuan, and President Chen of our newspaper donates another 50,000 yuan, as relief funds for the disaster area. If you would like to donate, our newspaper's Social Service Department will begin receiving donations on behalf of the victims today and will transfer them to the responsible authorities for distribution at any time.</p>
<h3>Director Gu of the Propaganda Department Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gu Qianzhi, Director of the Shanghai Special City Propaganda Department, officially took office yesterday (the 15th). Director Gu arrived at the government at 9:00 AM yesterday. Former Director Liu Dexuan handed over the seals and documents, and then convened a meeting of all staff in the department to encourage everyone to do their best to work in their positions. His words were mostly admonishing, and the staff were deeply moved. Director Gu then met with reporters from various newspapers and gave a brief speech, saying: At this time, as the war situation is approaching a decisive battle, we feel that the responsibility of reporting is even more important. I hope that colleagues in the city's news industry will fully exert the effectiveness of the news in accordance with the propaganda guidelines issued by the national government. In addition, the Shanghai Small Newspaper Association held a welcome banquet for Director Gu at the Kangle Grand Building at 7:00 PM last night. The atmosphere at the time was extremely enthusiastic. The Shanghai branch of the China News Association is also scheduled to hold a welcome banquet for Director Gu today.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Delegation Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Trip Was Successfully Completed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai business community organized a delegation to Jiangsu Province, led by delegation leader Yuan Ludeng and deputy delegation leader Chen Riping. They went to Jiangsu on the 12th, stayed for three days, and returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th. Upon arriving in Jiangsu, they first exchanged views with Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province on issues such as the evacuation of the population of Shanghai, the transfer of daily necessities factories inland, the organization of rural loans in Jiangsu Province, and the construction of the Jiangsu-Shanghai Highway. They reached a consensus on all issues. On the 13th, they visited various relevant officials and non-governmental organizations. On the 14th, they went to Dongting West Mountain for inspection. During their stay in Jiangsu, all members of the delegation worked hard in inspections and socializing, but the purpose of this trip has been achieved, and the ties between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai have become closer from now on.</p>
<p>Suzhou, Central News Agency, 15th – The Shanghai business community delegation recently visited Suzhou and paid their respects to Governor Ren of the province. Governor Ren met with them and hosted a banquet for the delegation leader Yuan Ludeng and deputy delegation leader Chen Riping at the Yuanyang Hall at 7:00 PM that evening. He also made a statement to the press, saying that there are currently four matters being organized in Shanghai: 1. Evacuate the population to avoid unnecessary sacrifices during wartime. 2. Provide rural loans to farmers in Jiangsu Province to reduce the suffering of farmers from high-interest loans and enable them to increase food production. 3. Establish small factories in various parts of Jiangsu Province to facilitate the flow of labor, materials, and products between Shanghai and the interior. 4. Construct a highway between Suzhou and Shanghai to facilitate transportation. These matters are all related to the welfare of the people in both Shanghai and Suzhou. Therefore, we hope that officials and people from both Shanghai and Suzhou will work together to realize the increase in the happiness of the people as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>North Train Station: Improvements to Order - A Conversation with the Head of the China Railway Shanghai Bureau</h3>
<p>To thoroughly reorganize the station's order and facilitate legitimate passengers, the Shanghai Bureau of the China Central Railway Company has, since the beginning of this month, undertaken significant reforms. In addition to regulating ticket purchasing and entrance facilities for passengers, strict discipline has been imposed on all subordinate Chinese staff, and employees violating regulations have been dismissed. Simultaneously, to respond to passenger concerns, a passenger information desk was officially established on the 15th to resolve various passenger difficulties. Yesterday afternoon, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Da Meiyuan, the head of the Bureau and stationmaster, and Mr. Naito, the deputy stationmaster, who kindly shared the following conversation about the North Station's station affairs and the reforms in station order:</p>
<p>This station is eliminating illegal staff members, dismissing them, and employing new personnel. To prevent a recurrence of past problems, we will strictly manage new employees in the future. Previously, due to language barriers among the station's Japanese personnel and a lack of deep understanding of Chinese customs, a small number of Chinese staff members inevitably took advantage of their positions and engaged in improper behavior. Through this thorough reorganization, we aim to ensure that every passenger is satisfied and receives convenient service. From the stationmaster down to all staff members, we are now approaching the Chinese people with sincerity. To maintain order and correct past不良現象, wooden fences have been installed at the station entrance, designating separate entrances for first, second, and third-class passengers, and preventing illegal elements and vendors from entering the station. This should greatly benefit passengers entering the station. The passenger information desk is dedicated to solving all passenger difficulties and providing practical assistance. In addition to Deputy Stationmaster Xinye concurrently serving as its head, three Chinese staff members have been appointed to assist with the work. In the future, any improper behavior by station staff should be reported to the station immediately to eradicate abuses. To rigorously manage Chinese staff, they will receive appropriate education to ensure they deeply understand the necessary knowledge. To facilitate ticket purchases for female passengers traveling alone, an additional ticket window has been set up next to the existing ticket office to serve Chinese female passengers. The station was unaware of the past rampant activities of the "Yellow Gang" preying on passengers. In addition to sending personnel for secret investigations, we hope the police bureau will take responsibility for investigating and rely on passenger cooperation to report any illegal activities. If station staff members are found to have engaged in illegal behavior, we will handle it impartially and without leniency based on evidence provided. Firstly, the station will conduct close inspections of Chinese staff, and those found to be engaging in improper conduct will be dismissed.</p>
<p>As the Great East Asia War intensifies, China and Japan are closely collaborating to secure final victory. Therefore, China Railway itself is striving to明　化 passenger transportation under決戰, to alleviate the travel pains of the people. The passenger information desk established today is entirely dedicated to serving the Chinese people, and we hope you will make full use of it. Regarding passengers carrying light luggage into the station in the future, the limit is two pieces, totaling 15 kilograms. If the weight is exceeded, a luggage ticket must be purchased. We earnestly hope that citizens purchase tickets in an orderly queue and remain calm when purchasing tickets, please do not自行　擾, to maintain order. This will speed up ticket sales and allow you to retrieve any change due. Furthermore, non-passengers and all vendors are not allowed to enter the station. Except for official business and special circumstances involving picking up or seeing off passengers, you can apply to the information desk to purchase platform tickets, limited to two tickets per person. The information desk's service hours are from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Regarding the luggage room facilities, iron doors will be installed again on the 17th of this month to prevent混入 by those with bad intentions. Nearby vendors will also be driven away, not only to facilitate traffic but also to protect the health of passengers. Finally, we sincerely hope that every passenger purchases tickets for the prescribed車, avoiding unnecessary　消耗, and　厉拒　black market tickets.</p>
<h3>Only Adjusting Cash on Hand, Strictly Suppressing Premiums - A Conversation with the Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a continued shortage of cash筹码 in the market, and people have experienced premium (贴水) issues when needing cash. Yesterday, a reporter made a special visit to Mr. Qian, the Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, to inquire about the situation. He kindly responded as follows:</p>
<p>Our bank's adjustment of cash positions for银钱业 is solely for the purpose of enabling them to meet the needs of their depositors. Therefore, to the best of our ability竊, we will provide assistance. Based on the daily amount of cash disbursed, there should not be a situation in the market where there is a shortage of铁码, leading to premiums. However, we fear that some unscrupulous colleagues are deliberately withholding cash to collect premiums and profit from it. We must find ways to eliminate this trend. Previously, we ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to send personnel for thorough investigations. It has been discovered that a small number of colleagues are collecting large amounts of cash daily while imposing strict restrictions on depositors and selling the cash at a premium. This behavior must be suppressed. Therefore, we have continued to order strict inspections. If any colleagues engage in this behavior again, they will be severely punished once discovered, and their right to collect cash daily will be suspended. As for colleagues with numerous deposits, whose daily cash collection is truly insufficient, we will make appropriate and adequate supplies at any time, with the ultimate goal of eliminating premiums, saving merchants from unnecessary losses, and achieving full stability of the social economy.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Gold Certificates to Be Issued Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The gold certificates approved for issuance by the Central Reserve Bank were issued in the first phase on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd of this month, with exceptionally good results. The demand was extremely enthusiastic. Because the bank's listed gold certificate prices were fairer than general black market prices, and the gold reserve was sufficient, redemption was conducted after one month, which gained considerable public trust. We have learned that the second phase of gold certificates will be issued from the 17th to the 19th of this month, still lasting for three days. The listed price of the gold certificates will also be revised according to the latest market conditions. It is anticipated that there will be even more enthusiastic buyers at that time.</p>
