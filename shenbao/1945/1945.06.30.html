<p>南京二十九日中央社電　國民政府陣代主席，以蘇北為反共工作重要地區，對該地軍政實况，民間疾苦，至為關懷。持於本月二十八日是由京啓節赴該區巡視，隨行者有中政會秘書長岑德廣·侍從室主任周隆庠·參軍長廬英·中政會秘書長郭秀峯·高級侍從官林基·何俊良等及盟邦最高軍事顧問淺海少將。是日午抵揚州，召集蘇北綏靖公署高級官員及第二方面軍將領訓話，晚抵泰州駐節。二十九日晨檢閱部隊訓話，對以反共實現統一，以參戰爭取獨立解放之當前兩大對內對外政策，諄諄訓示，全體官兵　聽之下，倍加感奮。同日午歸途經過揚州，下午四時三十分安返首都。茲將詳情分述於後：</p>
<p>揚州視察</p>
<p>二十八日上午八時許，陳代主席於大雨中由下關乘車啓節赴揚，一行數十人啓節時，中樞各長官均齊集車站恭送，十時三十分車抵鎭江，蘇北綏靖主任孫良誠氏在車站率領高級官員恭候主席下車，隨登預備汽車馳往碼頭，車站外以迄碼頭路旁，均立軍警官吏學生民衆恭迎致敬。十時四十五分登專輪渡江，是日天氣晴朗，水波不興，十一時三十分安抵江北岸六圩，揚屬各長官豐民衆代表已先在碼頭恭迎。主席下舟，旋登汽車，由衛士軍前導，隨從分別乘軍魚貫而行，經二十餘里抵城，入凱旋門，城門內外大道兩旁恭立民衆學生不下萬餘人，均手執旗幟，高呼擁戴口號，沿途懸旗並黏貼標語，其中警句如「擁護陳代主席要實踐和平反共建國國策」，「擁護陳代主席要肅淸萬惡共匪」「擁護陳代主席要解除蘇北民衆痛苦」。座駕入城後，即赴行轅稍事休息，十二時三十分召集黨正高級官員訓話。</p>
<p>訓話要旨</p>
<p>首術來蘇北地區巡視目的，一為欲明瞭蘇北地區勦共實况，暨軍政設施是否與時局需要配合，一為宣示中央和平反共建國國策始終不變，勗將領應堅定信念，信賴中央，協力國策。　召示今後兩天任務，第一為要加緊反共工作，蓋國共不兩立，有共黨存在，不獨危害國民黨，抑且妨害國家民族之生存，蘇北為共匪盤據之所，吾人應加緊勦除，以根絕其殘餘勢力。第二為參加大東亞戰爭問題，關於中國參戰，原係自動，非因利乘便之舉，且反英美帝國主義侵略，乃係國父遺敎，吾人於爭取中國獨立自由之餘，更應為東亞各民族以爭取自由平等，至此，復歷述東亞百年來遭受英美帝國主義者壓迫之更實，後詳解此次舊金山會議之內幕及英美野心。中國參戰原為我國革命反侵略之一貫方針，始終不變，成敗利鈍在所不計，最後闡明世界情勢，語意深長，昤話完畢，歷時三十分，訓話完畢，由孫主任領導呼口號後，即往行轅休息。下午一時孫綏靖主任在揚社餐廳恭宴，並柬邀盟邦將領恭陪。席間孫主任向主席獻詞，大意謂，蘇北地方決謁誠擁護中央，並表明反共決心，主席賜訓，勉諸將領為反共工作而奮鬥，與宴各員莫不感奮，二時許宴畢。</p>
<p>泰縣閱兵</p>
<p>三時三十分乘汽車啓節赴泰，揚泰公路全程七十餘里，歷時二時許，沿塗沃野千里，遙見碉堡呈羅棋佈，足見該地防禦鞏固。蓋事變以還，共匪乘機堀起，散布蘇北各地，民衆備受茶毒，今於綏署及第二方面軍努力勦除之下，共匪日見歛跡，使共黨早日聲稱以蘇辦為延安第二之狂語粉碎無遺，淪為流散之徒，主席對此頗為嘉許。六時抵泰縣，該地第二方面軍自孫兼總司令以下各高級將領，各地方長官·民衆學生暨盟邦軍民，均立於道旁恭迎，手執標語高呼口號，與揚屬所見略同。六時零五分抵行轅休息，旋召見第二方面軍各高級將領聽取報吿，有所指示。八時晚宴，主席諄諄以出巡對地方多有　費為慮，勉孫總司令應愛惜物力，不必舖張，孫總司令聞聽唯唯。九時許宴畢，十時休息，入晚天降大雨，澈夜未止。二十九日晨七時三十分往閱兵前往，是時大雨初止，塲地泥濘，然士兵精神極為旺盛，出三十八師師長孫雨田担任指揮官，受檢兵三團配備整齊，首請主席繞塲檢閱一週，旋由各排士兵操演，內分劍剌敎練拳術，均極精彩，操演完畢，　請主席訓詞。（訓詞要義與在揚訓話同，不另錄）末由孫總司令領導呼口號，於是擁護陳代主席·擁護和平反共建國國策·主席萬歲·中會民國萬歲之聲，振耳欲聾。由此可見地方竭誠擁護中央，擁護陳代主席之情緒。</p>
<p>啓節返京</p>
<p>九時三時分啓節返揚州，該地恭送民衆因昨宵一夜豪雨，農事有望　，莫不以甘霖係隨主席而降，歡欣異常。緣蘇北久旱，經此豪雨，農事可期，農民狂喜，非無因焉。座駕離泰縣城後，甫登揚泰公路，即見積潦遍地，車行困難，然主席並不以舟車勞頓為苦，反時露喜容，領袖之偉大人格，感人至深。十二時三十分車抵揚州，十二時三十分午膳，下午一時三十分離揚，至六圩換乘專輪渡江，二時五十分抵鎭江，三時許達車站，十九分車行，四時三十分安抵首都，沿途各該地軍官民恭送如儀，抵京時，于中央各長官恭迎下，乘車返官邸休息。</p>

<h3 id="c3">日軍航空隊奇襲峇厘巴板敵艦羣　以分散戰法獲得大戰果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南方前綫基地二十九日中央社電　日新銳航空部隊七生隊，為殲滅峇厘巴板近海之敵有力艦艇羣，二十五日傍晚由基地踴躍出發，對峇厘巴板東方海面約四十公里處游弋之敵艦艇隊，加以猛烈之奇襲攻擊。日機冒熾烈防空砲火，全機進至敵艦艇羣上空，相繼以魚雷施以攻擊，迄今判明之戰果，擊沉大型巡洋艦一艘·巡洋艦或逐艦三艘以上·油船一艘以上。七生隊所攻擊之敵艦船羣，乃敵海上有力部隊，係以大型巡洋艦三艘，大型驅逐艦四艘，小型驅逐四艘等組成。敵掃海艇羣於二十五日夜曾泊於峇厘巴板東方四十公里海面，布成輪形陣勢，而七生隊採取分散奇襲戰法，始能獲得如此大戰果，此外復曾確認於敵艦艇羣中發生大火杜數條。</p>
<p>南西太平洋基地二十九日中央社電　峇厘巴板敵艦艇，二十五日遭日軍雷擊隊之奇襲攻擊，巳蒙重創，但仍積極增强實力，其行動似極愼重，除出動B24型，B25型，P38型等機飛臨日軍陣地外，並調遣掃海艇，驅潛艇，驅逐艦，巡洋艦，施行熾烈之砲擊，掩護登陸舟艇　近海岸綫，愼密偵察日軍陣地。二十七日敵艦艇蠢動於海面，計有重巡洋艦五艘，輕巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦十艘，掃海艇及驅逐艇二十餘艘，油槽船三艘，輸送船數艘，此外，登陸舟艇亦較前日增加，其後方更有形似水上機母艦一艘游弋中，敵在峇厘巴板之登陸企圖，巳益形露骨。</p>

<h3 id="c5">美國與渝兵共間的矛盾 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>昨天各報登載中共抨擊美國封華政策的消息，足以說明渝共之間與渝共美之間的三角矛盾。</p>
<p>共產黨為什麼當初要縱勇國民黨聯合抗戰呢？那是共產黨想乘抗戰而擴充自己的勢力，更進而消滅國民黨的力量而奪取政權，中共的動機是不純正的。又美國為什麼要利用重慶同時利用中共來反日呢？美國以資本帝國主義的立塲，始終企圖爭奪整個中國的市塲，遂其傾銷商品，經濟侵略的目的。因為它要爭霸中國整個市塲，一方面使中國國內勢力相消，減弱自主力量，一方面以誘惑手段，排斥其他國外勢力。這種美國資本帝國主義的立塲，在中日事變以前固屬明顯，在事變以後，更為積極。所以美國的動機也是不純正的。</p>
<p>從這兩種不純正的動機出發，當然雙方合作不會持久，在所謂「合作」的過程中必然發生矛盾，因此美國對於中共的援助自非絕對的。美國的對華政策有兩條路綫，是很顯然的事實。</p>
<p>我們在這裏必須注意的，便是在美國對華的兩條相反的路綫中，如何看出美國對華的一貫方案。美國為什麼要採取兩種政策呢？很明顯的說，重慶對於美國同情中共的態度是不滿的，同時中共對於美國以大部份力量帮助重慶，也是不滿的。史蒂威爾路綫，哈萊路綫所把握的，不過是美國表面上對於華政策的見解上的分岐，實際上美國在過去在現在甚至在將來始終有着一貫的對華方策。</p>
<p>中日事變的起因的原因。我們看史蒂威爾提出的要求，所謂　中國抗日勢力之單一化，　渝軍對中共解除其封鎖，轉用封鎖部隊開往前線，　美國對於中共軍隊有補給其最少限度之必要武器等，更足以充分表現了美國的野心之所在！</p>
<p>所謂哈萊路線是承認重慶為正統的，這是美國從事變以事的一貫作風。同時，也可以說明重慶與美國勢力的結合。因為重慶政權中間，很多自命美國系美國派者，在政治上取得相當地位，形成相當勢力，這是中共所望塵莫及的。但是，因為美國對華政策的動機不純正，雖然對於渝共的磨擦非常關心，而沒有絕對調和的決心和力量。</p>
<p>要之，我們在此時此地應認淸美國對華政策的目的是在戰後獲得優先的市塲，旣不希望中國統一，又不希望中國能自主獨立。不但企圖利用渝共兩方的力量來消耗日本的軍力，同時也是使日本的軍力消　中國整個的元氣。由於這樣的觀察，美國旣利用重慶，復利用中共，而中共不甘完全受美國利用，重慶則脫不了美國的束縛，形成四分五裂的局面，在這種渝共之間與人美這間的矛盾局面之中，我們站在人民立塲，自然需要打開一條自主的出路，那末，「和平反共建國」，是國民政府的國策，我們認為在理論上極天確適當的，可是，因為政治力量不夠，旣不能反共，又不能實現全面和平，所以，人民自主的出路還不能積極打開，然而，怎樣打開人民自主的出路，無欵是我們今日最感覺苦悶的問題。</p>

<p>中央社滬訊　美國支配重慶之勢力逐漸强大，凡關心中國將來之人士，莫不深抱　憂。六月二十六日渝電　曾廣播「論中國戰區美軍司令部」一文，該文根據由中國戰區美軍司令部所得之報道，論述該司令部所得之報道，論述該司令部之勢力，支配到中國之增產計劃·通貨金融等方面，洋洋誇示美國之支配重慶力量。該文稱，「中國戰區美軍司令部對於渝軍進攻部隊佔領地區之行政，亦與協力，將中國經濟配合與作戰，成立較近代的新組織」云。就該司令部所屬所謂「G五局」之組織任務及其內容有所報道，所謂G五局設於重慶，有「中國任何軍事行動均受影響之活動神經中樞」之稱，計分　軍需及配給部，　生產部，　購料部，　民用經濟部，　軍政府部，　機密部等六部。其任務有六，第一為「對華貸與軍需品之事務決定」，第二為「開發中國之工業，迅速供給中國內之一切軍需」，第三為「購入物資，解決中國課稅問題」，第四為「通貨物價之統制」，第五為「審議重慶政府各項計劃美籍顧問之建議，傳達於重慶政府，硏究新佔領地區行政計劃」，第六為「軍事連絡機關」。觀察該項G五局之組織及任務，顯然基於美國推行作戰計劃之必要，積極伸張勢力至渝方之政治經濟政策，換言之，中國之工業開發問題·通貨物價問題等之經濟政策，諸凡渝方之各種政策，美軍司令部刻正加以統制及管理。上述之Ｇ五局與渝方各機關具有何種關係及連　，尙未能明瞭，然如斯美國支配重慶，於促進重慶之「近代化」美名下，逐漸强力而露骨化，顯已超越目前戰必要之限度，逐漸發展為美國金元帝國主義之重慶完全殖民地化。</p>

<p>— 藍彧</p>
<p>關於先天道</p>
<p>記者等抵錫時</p>
<p>記者等抵錫時，對先天道曾三方面採訪，一為軍警機關，一為知識份子，一為普通市民。以知識份子最折衷，其批評為：先天道神言怪說，固然荒謬，但先天道自有其成長之背景，蓋先天道之反抗對象，為稅吏，鄕鎭保長，地痞流氓等，先天道之組成，大部份為農民，若農民平日與彼等無怨無仇，決不會以刀槍相見；故要敉平先天道，須從剷除貪汚着手。</p>
<p>或問：先天道主犯倪子才如何？以記者觀之，容貌平庸，談吐並無出奇處，老實而習禮貌；以平庸若此者，相見之下，不會相信他有那種作為。或說：「有些驚人舉動，往往是平庸的老實人幹出來的。」</p>
<p>鄕公所歛財法</p>
<p>有一區，計有二十鄕鎭，每一鄕鎭，按月須孝敬上司二十萬元。</p>
<p>有一個鄕鎭公所的開支，比縣政府要大幾倍：鄕鎭公所的負責人，大都跨在數種勢力之間；鄕鎭公所最忙的工作，就是應付這種數種勢力；鄕鎭公所之所以支出浩大，即是這最忙的工作所賜。</p>
<p>不好的鄕鎭公所歛財之法，就在利用各種名義，籌集的供應費，若鄉民抗拒，則隨時可有方法，對付鄕民，加以拘捕，嚴刑拷打。</p>
<p>鄕間來了土匪，鄕民巳不敢吿發，一方面土匪知道，置之死命，同時吿發所得結果，仍要損失烟酒柴米。</p>
<p>農民苦痛斑</p>
<p>無錫鄕間，有「搗　頭」之諺語，所謂搗　頭，就是一倍份有槍人員，知道農民好將金銀首飾，藏在　器內，因之三五成羣，常到農民人家，角隅僻處，找　　頭，一經找到，凡是倒放或封口者，就用木棍將底撞破，以觀究竟。</p>
<p>在鄕間無較大之經營，舉一例子：「有人回鄕，在鄕間開一油行，開門之後，營業尙稱發達，但供應費浩繁，一月收入，僅抵開支，二月以後，忽有不速客數人，前來該行，找店主拆股，行原為獨資經營，店主與之爭辨，彼等即出該行牌號相同之股票，對店主聲色俱厲，聲稱如不折股，則到隊部講理，結果託人講情，訴苦再三，聞以六十萬了事。」</p>
<p>不意未隔半月，事聞於又一方面，改了一個方式，來持槍者數人，揚言該行經營不正，將店主綁架以去，於是復經一番哭訴，卒以五十萬了結。店主經此二度打擊，亟將店停歇，撮回城區，資本以是　折大半。</p>
<p>沿途設卡，似巳成一部份軍警公開之財路，有一縣，由長江進口，僅數里，即設有十三道卡，普駝一小船，每卡須孝敬二千元；由城區至蘇州，則設卡約有百六十道；每道亦須如此之數，但以上只是指空船，若是裝有貨物，便須看貨物之價値，及貨主應付而定。</p>
<p>監犯及其他</p>
<p>見某縣縣政槪况：「本縣監牢，房屋破壞不堪，設備簡陋，冬季難避風雨，夏季有碍衛生……人犯口糧，每日每名規定國幣二十元，事實上不敷甚鉅，不得不由本府按名發給食米……由那句「夏季有碍衛生」，猶可想到張前司法部長之所以亡故。</p>
<p>江陰茶肆酒樓，貼有甚多勸民完標語，抄錄數則於下，足見勸民納糧工作之艱巨，「完納糧稅是國民應盡的天職」，「先納為榮，後納為恥」，「糧戶納賦應選上等稻穀」，「攙雜印水粃穀充納糧賦的是莠民」。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　據倫敦電稱：英國於此次大戰中，除蕩盡其國外投資十億鎊外，復負起二十三億鎊之外債，現已成為一之債務國家，故其欲謀打開此種經濟上危機之唯一方策，除以英帝國集團之名義，榨取其自治領諸國家外，自無路可圖。惟最近一二年來，自治領諸國之反英傾向與日俱增，使英國根本發生動搖。本年六月二日英著名經濟學者菲夏敎授，曾在却達姆飯店向實業家團體演講，預言英帝國崩潰與孤立無援之原因，致一般聽衆深感不安。其講演要旨大致如次：認為英帝國堪可期待者，將遭深重之幻滅悲哀，　自治領諸國本身，對於其將來之經濟觀念，並不與英國之目前利益一致。自治領各國認為有碍將來經濟繁榮之必要條件，預求於英聯邦範圍之外，樹立通商關係，如加拿大之理想，則求摒除世界通商壁壘而自由通商，加拿大經濟界認為即與美國緊密提携，能獲到美國大量物資之輸入，然於此債項尙未償淸之前，非獨不能容許此種排外性之英帝國集團參加，即南非聯邦對英帝國之態度，亦非常冷淡。蓋因共與世界各國自由通商之利益，遠多於加拿大故也。而澳洲之輿論則以為美國為澳洲肉類小麥羊毛等之購買國，故美乃為支配澳洲經濟之有力者，一方面英國不能實現其安全保障組織時，澳洲或將化為自力經營及工業極端發達之國家。鈕西　之情勢，亦與澳洲相同，至於印度則有孤立主義之傾向云。</p>

<p>首相莫洛斯基，副首相高莫爾加，副首相兼農業部長米柯拉席克，國防部長羅拉，席莫斯基，外長羅捷莫斯基，公務管理部長基安納克，公安部長拉特基惠資，財長唐勃羅斯基，實業部長明克，交通部長拉朋諾斯基，郵電部長蘇格達，航運暨國外貿易部長約特立高斯英，衛和部長立德溫，勞工暨福福部長斯登克，文化暨術部長高伐爾斯基，建設部長卡查洛斯基，情報部長馬多后捷斯基，司法長特高斯基，敎育部長惠捷克，農林部長特卡查。</p>
<p>基本問題解決關鍵</p>
<p>中央社訊　據路透社外交記者二十八日稱：最近莫斯科會議之結果，決定在華沙建立波蘭統一政府，關於此，有兩個基本問題發生，一為容認莫斯科之誠意，二為保證允許波蘭國內舉行自由選舉，倫敦之波蘭政權對此態茺如何，頗足注意。據該政權最近所發表之文件，對於蘇聯之誠意，頗露不信之意。關於所謂自由選舉，該政權之見解，為在蘇軍及政治警察隊留駐波境內，及政治生活不獲自由之時間內，自由公平之選舉，事屬絕不可能。總之，新波蘭政府之要人，以為蘇聯實衷心願與波蘭訂立友好關係，反之，倫敦波政權則抱波人傳統的猜欵心，故問題解決之關鍵，實縣於以上兩相反態度之能否調和。</p>
<h3 id="c25">蘇希望與土訂友好條約 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　據路透社軍事訪員基許談稱：關於將來管理韃靼尼爾海峽問題，事我項，將在三頭會議中提出討論一事，現似乎巳得證實。至於蘇聯與土耳其政府曾相互交換涉及韃靼尼　海　管理問題之意見　，性質如何，目前尙無官方透　消息。然一般人深信該項交換意見書，僅實涉及叙利亞衝突與里文達局勢危急之情事。現蘇聯政府希望與土耳其政府重新訂立友好及互助條，此將使昔日蒙特婁會議中所規定之韃靼尼爾海峽管理條例，成為具文而已。蘇聯之建議，不外欲使各外國戰船禁止駛入韃靼尼爾海峽，而僅蘇聯舉土耳其兩國得在該海峽內自由航行，故蘇聯政府業於日前曾向土政府提出建議，設立共同根據地，以保衛韃靼尼爾海峽與愛琴海。現土耳其當局深感不安者，乃為蘇聯要求土耳其政府之更加民主化。</p>

<p>阿夫頓·勃拉狄特報稱，蘇軍佔領波爾和爾姆嘉（瑞典南方波羅的海上丹麥領小島）後，勢必於下列六項問題之外，再引起歐洲第七項糾紛問題。所謂歐洲六大問題，即：　波蘭問題；　波蘭克朗克福特及奧特河流域管理問題；　奧地利親蘇政權問題；　　領利經亞海岸佔領問題；　蒂托政權要求托里斯特問題；　希臘要求歸還羅得島問題。關於此事，每日郵報稱：「此等糾紛之原因，在於各國圖謀確立領寺圈，而將此等地域劃入已國範圍內，是以上列問題，縱在和平會議中，殆亦難期解決。對付此種情勢，唯一方法，即以冷靜堅毅之態度，求取合法解決。此乃英美所取之方策，而有權要求蘇聯予以全面支持者。」此言即對英蘇之婉轉警吿。又一孟澈斯特導報則暗示蘇聯以不長期駐兵波爾和爾姆為妙·其言曰：「波爾和爾姆為戰略上極重要之島嶼，而丹麥又係解放國，並非被佔領國，此點務須記取。英國國民希望：蘇軍於軍事情勢許可下，迅即撤離該島。」</p>
<p>阿夫頓勃拉狄特報載哥木哈根特電稱，蘇軍絡繹開抵波爾和爾姆，似擬長駐該島。唯波爾和爾姆今日殆無德軍殘存其間，蘇軍工作，僅在收集德軍所棄彈葉武器，而送往後方耳。任蘇聯內務人民委員之紅軍一將校，抵達波爾和爾姆後，即與當地警察交涉，結果自十五日十七時二十分以後，該島與外界之電信電話連絡，即行停止。又一郵政飛機於十五日十一時飛抵波爾和爾姆島後，本應裝載當地郵件於下午飛離該島，亦遭阻止。關於此事，曾求當局聲明原因，但亦未允。然此事之發生，固非另有意外變故，純因該地軍事當局之意。</p>
<p>據情報稱，該島已到有蘇聯裝甲車部隊及砲兵五千，傳將增到一萬四千人。（斯德哥爾摩十七日電·譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c42">敎局規定下學期　各級學費標準　戴局長記者例會答問 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>市宣傳處主辦之記者例會，於昨日上午十時半在市府會議室舉行，由市敎育局局長戴英夫出席詳答各組社所提之問題如下</p>
<p>學費標準</p>
<p>（問）暑期轉瞬即屆下及私立學校學費標準，已加規定否？倘有學校不遵照規定標準辦理，擬如何處置？</p>
<p>（答）下學年第一學期市校學費標準，業已擬訂，根據各學校學生家庭經濟狀况，而決定學費之多寡，以及免費學生名額百分比，高中最高者二萬元，最低者一萬二千元，初中最高者一萬六千元，最低者一萬元，小學高級最高者一萬二千元，最低者四千元，低級最高者八千元，最低者三千元。私立中小學之經濟實任，應實令校董會切實負責，故徵收學費一節，擬暫准由校長商承校董會，根據多數學生家庭經濟狀况，而決定數額，並擬訂分期繳費辦法，規定免費學額，呈報本局備案，絕不許違背部令，徽收食米或以食米折款，違者當呈請市政府，予以懲處，以上詳細辦法，已在呈府核示中，一俟核准，即行公佈施行</p>
<p>里弄學校</p>
<p>（問）滬市私立學校即所謂里弄學校林立，內部設倘簡陋，不但誤人子弟，抑且有礙整個教育之發展，教局曾否考慮加以取締？</p>
<p>（答）滬市私立學校之多。爲世界各大都市所未見，事變後，更如兩後春笋，無人過問，內部設備簡陋，惟在此物價萬倍之秋，學校當局之困難，亦不無可原之處，本人之意，兒童失學者衆，祇須教師資歷相合，而能認眞辦學，即設備稍簡，在此時期，不擬苛求，而辦理腐敗，自當予以取締。</p>
<p>師資問題</p>
<p>各校對師資問題，頗多忽略，尤以各私立學校爲甚，且有小學尙未畢業而竟擔任小學敎師者，敎局有無整頓辦法？</p>
<p>（答）師資問題，爲事變後敎育上之一嚴重問題，優良敎師，均因生活威脅而離開學校，本人在遺都之始，即指出此項嚴鬣性，而大聲疾呼力求優良教師返聯學校之策。本局規定論資給薪，政府力謀改善教師待遇，即含有此種深刻意義。本學期中畢業大學教育學院而來市立小學任教員者有之，曾任教育應長多年而願擔任中學校長者有之，優良師資逐漸返勝學校，不可不謂已見　　。私校方面其情形亦各校不同，師資欠缺者，當然甚多，本局已訂有中小學教員任免規程。關於中小學敎師任用資格，均有所規定，當本此規定，逐步加以整頓，此項規程，一俟市府核准，即公佈施行。</p>
<p>更改學制</p>
<p>（問）一年三學期制，尚未經教育但現下一般學校，已於私下實行中，如聖約翰大學等現已開學，未知責局長對此如何處置？</p>
<p>（答）一年二學期，爲教部所規定，一年改爲三學期，有關國家整個學制問題，權在國家，本局在五月問即據報有大學檀擬改爲三學期者，誠恐影響所及，牽動全局，當即呈報教部，李部長對此頗爲震怒，即分飭上海私立專科以上學校，不得擅自改爲三學期，今所言倘係事實，教部定予取締。</p>

<h3 id="c52">綠蔭下的特攻隊基地 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>在義烈空挺隊强行降於敵軍陣地的前後，先後從某基地出發的特攻隊，衝入敵方艦船羣，建立了莫大的戰勳。這次，記者為觀察該基地的情形，特地前往參觀。</p>
<p>是日，在空襲警報聲中，抵達目的地。久雨初晴，天氣很朗爽，整個基地，彷彿打足了氣的皮球，充滿彈性。利用深綠的樹木，和複雜的地形，部隊的本部和四通八達的飛行塲通路，都掩蔽得很好，極難為格拉曼或B29型機發見。而且，防空設備盡美盡善，看了叫人心安。是日晨，此地的航空部隊，奉命掩護由其他基地出發的特攻隊。我到那邊時，正値快要起飛。</p>
<p>「媽的，今日總要把格拉曼打它一個落花流水！」全身飛行裝束的戰士們，握着軍刀，快步走向座機。</p>
<p>這時，遙遠的天空突然出現格拉曼機的編隊數隊，遠遠望去，只有芝蔴粒大小。他們環繞飛行塲一周，似乎發見正在出動的飛機，開始降低高度。在「敵機！」「敵機！」的一片呼喊聲中，許多機械士為了保護尙未　飛的飛機，都不肯躱入防空壕。</p>
<p>橫轉，急降下。瞬息間，敵機開始向地面掃射了。機關砲以外，似乎還混有火箭彈。激戰數分鐘，跑來作牽制冲繩戰局之攻擊的敵機，終為對空射擊的砲火驅散，落荒而去。全體正將出發的飛機，只有一架遭害，其餘都一點沒有受損。於是依照預定的時刻，相繼飛離機塲，出發攻敵。</p>
<p>「哈哈，出征啦！」數日來，因為天氣不好，隊員早就為了不能前去殺敵，而有髀肉復生之感。這時能够順利的出發，無不歡天喜地。在震天動地的隆隆巨聲中，他們告別了基地。</p>
<p>如火似荼的鬥意</p>
<p>這個基地上，上自部隊長，下至二等兵，所吃的午飯都是一樣的，就是：麥飯和鹹蘿蔔絲。雖說是在日本內地，這早晚，野戰部隊也只吃着乾的或醃的蔬菜。</p>
<p>「兩三天以前，吃到了捲心菜，是生的，味道可眞不錯！」本部某將校說。</p>
<p>生活雖然這樣淸苦，可是意氣的豪邁，鬬志的堅決，絕對未受絲毫的影響。</p>
<p>「我們的機數，即使比敵機少，我們絕不畏縮！」某中尉說。</p>
<p>「不管怎樣，咱已給他幹上啦！他媽的，把塞班擾一個翻身吧。」看到敵機實行絨毯轟炸的新聞時，一個關東出身的兵憤憤然說道。</p>
<p>這種復仇的心理，自下士官以至佐官級，都異常强烈，眞可說一聲「意氣冲天。」這種如燃的鬥聲，是他們生活上唯一的指針，而且支配了他們全部的時間。</p>
<p>在　　的對面，就是尋常百姓家。想不到咫尺相隔，竟有了兩個世界！</p>
<p>人機一體的心境</p>
<p>「大家都有最新銳的飛機，那就好了！」這是某部隊長的希望。</p>
<p>今晨出發的機羣，已有無綫電報打來，說是快要歸來了。部隊長很覺滿意，即刻到飛行塲去。等不得多時，從那方連綿的山峯上，出現了歸來的友機，一架又一架，連翩而來。未幾，解散隊形，相繼降在機塲上。</p>
<p>「剛纔我眞擔憂，怕他們不能平安着陸。起初，他們出發時，我也放心不下。我雖然手裏揮着　子送他們，可是却暗暗揑了一把汗，直到看見輪子離開地面，飛機浮在空中，總舒了一口氣。」飛行塲某隊長說。他將寶貴的飛機，當作自己身體的一部分看待。</p>
<p>人才濟濟的部隊</p>
<p>此處的部隊，人材輩出，擁有在東京上空撞燬B29的栗村尊中尉及坂本勇軍曹，一個得到天皇的獎狀，一個獲得武功章。除出這兩位殊勳者，還有在敵艦上機大舉空襲關東時，曾經擊隊格拉曼機十八架，擊毀六架的勇士。</p>
<p>「運氣比今天壞的日子，怕是沒有了。」歸來的勇士嘆道。</p>
<p>平安歸來，還要說運氣不好，眞叫人弄不明白了。跑去仔細一打聽，原來為了今天出去未遇對手。</p>
<p>「我們擔任掩護工作，一路平安，除兩架出毛病，被迫降陸以外，其餘都無事歸來。從列島綫到冲繩一帶，天氣很好，特攻隊的攻擊，完全成功。」這是他們歸還時的報吿。途中雖沒有發生戰鬥，然而掩護特攻隊的重要任務，是完全執行了的。</p>

<h3 id="c53">本土决戰與國民義勇隊 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>為備本土決戰，日本國民義勇隊的組織，全國各地，大抵完竣。冲繩島的地上戰鬥，現在旣已吿　，本土決戰的時機，愈見迫切。而國民義勇隊的國民決戰組織，也鬥志如　，正向其純正的目標，開始活潑的行動。下面所記，就是和陸軍省某中佐的問答記　，由此可見日本國民義勇隊的純正姿態。</p>
<p>問　為貫澈本土決戰起見，先須堅定對於本土決戰的覺悟，這是要緊的。只要有澈底的覺悟，能於決戰的各項準備，自能熱心從事。然而，民間頗多　抱希望的觀測，以為敵軍或許不會在本土上陸。在這樣的情形下，無論怎樣對國民高喊：本土決戰快來了，也難使他們認眞人事準備的。</p>
<p>答　敵軍是否來攻本土，當然須得日後的事實來證明。不過，從彼我雙方的戰略看來，本土決戰的必然性，此時已可明白知道，這就是我們認為必會發生本土決戰的理由。從敵方而言，直搗本土的上陸作戰，可以決定戰爭的最後結果，乃是最重要的要點攻擊。自從太平洋反攻開始以來，本土決戰實為畫龍點睛之筆。譬如打棒球，在　班·硫黃島及冲繩等地，付出莫大的血的代價，而得了若干分的敵軍，如不實行攻擊本土，則和最後自動棄權一樣，無論其得分若干，也不能算他勝了。</p>
<p>馬里亞納方面，現有B29型機九百，冲繩基地及硫黃島基地，今後料想行將迅速擴充，而敵軍基地空軍的戰略戰術轟炸，將更澈底。以千架為單位的敵機突襲，不久將出現吧。然而，突襲並不能決定戰爭的最後。敵軍為了戰到最後一回合，並求爭取勝利起見，必須用舟艇或空輸部隊在我本土登陸。今後，敵軍將使本土轟炸澈底化，同時或將實行大陸接岸作戰，或在朝鮮沿岸登陸，然而局部決戰回數的累增，用意無非在使最後一戰順利，所以本土必為最後的決戰塲，而本土決戰也必定是最後的一個回合。</p>
<p>不過，由於歐戰的結束，敵方頗望戰爭早日終了，而且日益增加的敵方損害，也使敵軍不欲再作局部的進攻，而直犯本土，以圖展開最後決戰。這種可能性，現已相當大。對於敵軍的本土決戰戰略，我方也有盡妥盡善的決戰戰略。我方實得地利人和之宜，可將全部戰力集中對付進犯的敵軍，而不再有孤島作戰時的困難，可於大陸作戰中與敵相見。所以本土決戰雖為敵方所欲，同時也是我方所盼望的。過去的戰事，敵軍常　處主動地位，但在本土決戰中，將一反昔時舊態，必由我方主動，而陷敵軍於挨打地位。換言之，不是彼攻我守，而是攻擊對攻擊的血鬬。如果我們沒有這樣的氣魄，那就是對於本土決戰的期待尙欠充分。</p>
<p>問　本土決戰，方是與國運國土相共的戰鬬。由於地利人和之宜，固然有許多大陸作戰之利可得，而且全國民衆均將起而捍衛國土，然而，我們對於困難和不利之點，也不應掩起眼睛來。毋寗應該指明它們，使民衆深刻了解，由此方可使國民對於國土之戰抱正確的態度。是嗎？</p>
<p>答　迄今為止的孤島作戰，我方只是以一定的兵力作戰而已。敵軍雖不絕增援，我方的守軍總是有限。此因敵方的機動兵力佔絕對的優勢，所以能够維持其　大的兵站動脈。然在本土決戰時，情形可不同了。在島嶼上處於孤立狀態的我方戰力，至此乃可確保縱深的戰力。為此縱深戰力的根柢者，不必說，就是一億國民和國土。敵方當然要把兵站綫延至我本土，試行反擊我方的縱深戰力。本土決戰，就是和敵軍艦船飛機所維持的長大兵站綫鬬爭。從這兵站戰方面看，本土決戰顯然有利於我。不過，那時，軍隊與一般民衆並肩而戰，所以在戰綫與後方錯綜混雜的本土戰塲，與軍隊共同作戰的國民，其統率與組織，運用如果散漫，則軍隊頗多捲入國民無秩序漩渦中的危險。這就是本土化為戰塲時的不利點。</p>
<p>假設本土有一百萬軍隊，而只能出一百萬的戰力，那就與孤島作戰無異。以百萬的軍隊而有相當於三百萬，五百萬大軍的戰力，這就是理想的本土決戰。國民義勇隊的成立，及其將來必為戰鬥隊的意義，就是這裏。統率戰塲上的民衆，使盡本分，絲毫不失戰時秩序，俾精强的軍隊得於最佳條件下戰鬥，此即國民義勇隊本來的使命。我們旣擁有百戰磨練的精良大軍，但願國民義勇隊作此軍隊的後盾，形成縱深的戰力，俾前方將士得無後顧之憂，安心殺敵。</p>
<p>問　國民義勇隊的眞使命，即在完成兵站任務，這是非常重要的。然而，關於這一點，地方的末端部分似未充分理解。末端組織予人的印象，毋寗以輕起武器，從事戰鬥為其任務似的，例如農民放下鋤　，熱中於竹槍訓練。</p>
<p>答　的確有如此的人民幣。想必是被義勇隊呀戰鬥隊呀這些名詞弄迷糊了。一提起戰鬥隊，就以為是握起槍桿，到前綫去殺敵，實在是想錯了，這是不曾理解現代總力戰的眞謗。在總力戰中，全國民，全民族，都是戰鬥員。而且，決定近代戰戰鬥成敗的，不是第一綫，而是後方的兵站準備如何。際此本土決戰即將展開之秋，今日的生產限度，決定了明日的戰備。因為形勢如是，所以決戰準備的推進，全是生產的上昇，而握其關鍵者，可謂就是國民義勇隊的隊員。生產即戰鬥，在本土決戰時，此二者的關係特別密切。工廠的產業戰士在工塲中奮鬥，就是戰鬥；農民們在田畝間揮鋤力作，也是戰鬥，國民各從本位努力，熱心增產，即為本土決戰時國家所要求的國民態度。除直接化為戰塲的地方應作別論以外，上述的原則，即在國民義勇隊改為戰鬥隊時，也是不變的。若說戰鬥命令旣已頒布，國民就各自以竹槍當武器，亂哄哄的行動起來，戰爭是要失敗的。</p>
<p>假如農民丟掉鋤頭，拿起槍桿，那末誰來耕種呢？產業戰士如果放下鐵鎚，從事戰鬥訓練，那末明日的軍火誰來負責生產呢？進化論是竹槍訓練也好，戰鬥訓練也好，其眞正的意義，只在涵養奮鬥精神。（譯自六月二十七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c55">為水呼籲 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 聽秋</p>
<p>「開門七件事」，除却神仙少不得。但是處在目前生活程度狂飛猛躍的時代，能有幾家不為生活焦慮？負着家庭担子的人，誰不殫心竭慮，艱苦的謀支撑着一個門戶？</p>
<p>特價的高漲，已不能使人衣領溫館。而近月來層出不窮的自來水的糾紛，又給予市民新的刺激和威脅。</p>
<p>查本市市區以內，早無河沼。日用水端賴自來水之供應。最近水電公司又調整價額，較前增加兩倍。又超過限量而所處的罰款，也同時提高，這事對於市民的生活，影響實在太大</p>
<p>水與人生，關係實大。電力限制固然是戰時體制之下應採的步驟，但是有其他代用品可以取用。而「水」的限制和處罰，却有放寬和改　的必要。因為旣無代用物品可用，又無黑市供應。</p>
<p>最近為了用水超過限量而處罰的，實在不少。罰款的數目，最高　　三五百萬之巨。如此鉅數，實有使人「傾家蕩產」還不足償付之感。因此有若干地區，巳受斷水之厄運！試想那些身受者，日常生活若何？</p>
<p>受罰的大多是大樓，公共塲所，和若干里弄。受罰的原因，十九是一架總水表作為若干戶公用。在以前；消費是包括在租金之內，由業主繳付。自消費高昂之後，才劃歸房客自理。事實上房客們並不知道每月用水若干，限制量多少。於是不良的經租處，再任意加上若干手續費，苛　之事，罄竹難書。如果數目少呢。房客為求息事寗人，不得不忍痛交付。數目大呢，實在是無力負担，於是釀成很多難以解決的糾紛。</p>
<p>據筆者所知山西路某處，上月份罰欶二百餘萬元。為了一時無力交付，竟遭　水，經過有半個月光影，才湊齊了繳淸。可是水門還沒開放，而據說加倍以上的罰單又接着跟來。像這樣；豈非市民們但有償付罰金的義務，而失去了用水的權利，如此巨額的消費，簡直要超過其他的生活費了。</p>
<p>公司當局對用戶罰款的理由，是為了超過限量。那麽；我們為避免受罰，一面該恪守限制量，節省平時消耗，一面另謀妥善的辦法。</p>
<p>一般里弄居戶，倘若祇有一個總水表的。可以各自裝置分水表，（每架約五六萬元）在住戶中公舉個管理人，把公司限制量，平均分配，日後用水那家過量，那麽罰款便由過量的負担。這樣一來，浪費水量的可以有所警惕，而平時節省用水的，可免去冤枉的罰款，一切糾紛，自能迎刃而解！</p>
<p>同時又想到一般熟水舖（俗稱老虎灶），在高昂的消費，煤價，開支之下，依着二十元一杓的限價出售。他們的用水量當然是超過普通住戶多倍。不見目前已有若干熟水舖停止營業嗎？考查他歇業的緣故，十九無非是為消費的罰款。於是所有勉强在營業的，不得不提高售價，想借此　補。這樣自來水公司豈非間接，造成了　水黑市。</p>
<p>我人不得不向主管機關請求。為顧恤市民的生命安全，解除「水」的威脅！同時懇請目前的管理富局，請顧念今日中日人民共同的利益，寬放水量，減輕罰款。</p>
<h3 id="c56">論撥款單 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 苦口</p>
<p>撥款單之流通市面，在當時未嘗不是一種臨時救濟方法，所謂救濟者，因現行通貨不　　付，無可如何而行之。不料善因而得惡果，依理推論，實不應有此現象。試申言之：</p>
<p>顧名思義，撥款單代表即日撥款轉賬，無存留不轉賬而代替通貨流通之理。</p>
<p>凡開立撥款單，當然必有款存在　中儲行或銀行準備會與錢業準備庫而後開立，絕不應無存款而開撥款單。</p>
<p>撥款單為救濟通貨不足，應付存款，不應視作簽發撥款單，即等於付予行權。</p>
<p>以上三點，極為普通，應為人所共知，無用詳加解釋。然事實上無一不背道而馳，以致造成今日撥款單之惡果，殊為可怪。何出而致此，一言以蔽之曰：現行通貨，求過於供，固為主因，種種人為之非法舉動，追求暴利，囚求利而不顧一切，使極好之方法，得極惡之結果，要亦為其重要原因之一。旣往不咎，來者可追，繼撥款單之後，各行莊以平行綫本票應付提存，不久即將實行，應請發行行莊，愼重將事，蓋稍一不愼，貽害社會極大。茲就鄙見所以，分述於後，以供社會人士與金融業者之參考。</p>
<p>平行　本票，仍是一種轉賬票據，應當即日轉賬，不可視同現行通貨之一種。</p>
<p>平行綫本票，發票行莊，應負完全責任，不可任意發行。</p>
<p>持票者須注意其發票行莊之信用，若不加注意，視同一　，設或遭受損害，悔之晚矣。其注意方法，可設例以明之，例如甲應收乙之款一百萬元，乙以丙行莊之平行綫本票支付，甲應以能否信任丙行莊為主，設或不能信任，即可拒收，此為　權者之自由，債務者不能異議。</p>
<p>平行綫本票，發行時應詳記發行經過事實，以備查核，如發見行莊利用此項本票，而作非法行為者，應即勒令立刻停業嚴罰，各行莊每日應以未經轉賬餘額，據實塡報銀錢業公會備查。</p>
<p>平行綫本票，為臨時救濟通貨供不應求之措施，發行通貨之中儲銀行，應速謀根本改善辦法，增發現鈔，養活此項本票之發行，或竟停止之。</p>
<p>撥款單旣停止發行，巳發行者應迅速轉帳，收回註銷。銀錢業公會，應正式通吿，限期結束淸楚，並令各行莊在限期滿時，具扣餘額，將此項餘額，提出另存。</p>
<p>綜上所述，掛一　萬，統而言之，辦法為人所定。以本示代撥款單後，能否使通貨缺乏問題，順利解決，胥在人為也。</p>
<h3 id="c57">創辦義務職業學校 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 基文</p>
<p>讀了第十四期本刋所載「創設中高等義務學校」後，因而也有了下面的一些意見。</p>
<p>創設高等義務敎育，固然是很需要的事，但創辦義務的職業學校，也是目前刻不容緩的。因為職年靑年之中不許多是因轟學而就職的，對於求學深造之心很切。要謀他們的敎育問題，最便捷的方法，眞如由他們本身和他們的環境着手了。</p>
<p>工商業的資方大都是抱着多一事不如少一事的態度的，但賢明的資方却一定知道如果自己創辦了義務職業學校，來敎育自己的職工，非但不是他們的損失，反之却是他們的利益。嚷着待遇菲薄的，這一下就得到了精神上的優遇；受業者經過了一個時期，他們的水準就都提高了；從業員的敎育程度提高了，服務的效率不也就增加了麽？如果從業員有感於知遇之恩，因而矢竭忠誠，不更是資方的莫大收獲麽？另一方面受業者也得到了很大的利益。</p>
<p>不過這事情還是需要敎育當局來指示和領導；一面如今工商界勸說事情的意義和目的，更可解釋其中的利害關係，使頑固不化也會認眞地願意辦理。然後再想法作具體地更有系統地計劃，把各業間像公會般地組成一個單位而設一所義務學校，各單位中的小單位承認了他所應派的經費後，事情就立刻可以積極地進行了。</p>
<p>一面舉行需要受更高的敎育者的登記，從使有許多從業員已經受了社會的　影響，而不思讀書上進的，但我們相當大部份的都是限於環境而亟切殷望更求深造的，如果義務職業學校辦了一些時候，那些隔絕書本的工商業員，也很可能會受了周圍的影響而也思參加讀書，囚了大家的風氣而轉移的。</p>
<p>關於課室，敎師，敎程敎材等問題，自然還有待於敎育當局的分配與設法指導，或借用，或聘請兼職的，大槪上是沒有困難的。對於分班，最好能依程度的高下稍分為幾級，因為主科是選修各業間需要特別的知識學部的緣故，各業的義務學校勢不能併起來上課，但是有許多各業間基本的共同知識，是可以大家合併受敎，以省各方面的開支的。關於這種種，可以視當時的情形而定，最初是不必限於一定的規則。</p>
<p>總之：義務職業學校，如能次序井然，各方面都能興致勃勃如火如荼的辦理起來，沒有多少時候，沒有多少時候，成績一定　然可觀。工商界的職工的談吐與態度，一定能出人意外地進步或改變，至少精神方面的也無，形地會充實了許多。</p>
<h3 id="c58">取消貼現 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 隆英</p>
<p>「撥款單」貼現之風，所最受影響者乃升斗小民；一個做中學敎員的友人，辛苦一月，獲得十萬元撥款單一紙，先化整為零，再化零為現，以現糴米，僅一斗一升。同時某銀行一低級職員，每日可獲二十萬現鈔，以「二角」貼出，可凈獲四萬元，此外高級職員，以職務上之便利，轉輾將現鈔貼出，亦成為公開之秘密。是故哭者自哭，笑者自笑，徒然無形使物價高起二萬。</p>
<p>撥款單於七月三日起停止流通以後，市面上現鈔缺乏的問題，並不會因此解決。如任各行莊自行發出「本票」，仍是換湯不換藥，若本票絕不可貼現，則斗升小民苦矣。若放縱貼現，等於從前的「劃頭」，貼現率將漫無止境的高漲，斗升小民今後將何以為生？</p>
<p>對於國家通貨政策，小民識淺，本不可妄議，然總覺緊縮現鈔辦法，不無可討論之處，所以自今而後，我認為第一當先檢查銀行本身現鈔進出情形；第二，萬元　當考慮發行；則第三，可完全取消「撥款單」及「本票」之流行，使無從發生「貼現」；第四，使本埠　資歸於正當生產用途；第五，外埠及農村的現鈔，亦當設法收回。</p>
<p>此時此地，要辦到以上各點，也需要友邦人士的協力，要知現鈔問題之重要，並不亞於米糧問題。</p>

<h3 id="c59">不曾發光的彗星 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 何炯</p>
<p>這一次我負着一點輕的創作，回到了闊別了十年的故鄕—N市，在醫院裏住了一個多月，出院後母親特地為我在附近鄕下租了二間房子，要我在那裏休息休息，我一面為了不忍太使母親失望，同時一半也為了我對本來曾　厭過的故鄕起了一點懷戀，終於我暫時留下了。但是一向忙碌着的我，休息對我幾乎是種刑罰，我每天總愛散步得很遠，我希望在偶然的機會中會碰到一些新的事物；我也曾走訪過從前許多友人的家裏，但是我簡直不能遇到一個故人，我感到了寂寞，我更思念起他們，我每天總帶着一種祈求的心情等待着新奇的遇合。</p>
<p>終於在一天淸晨，我閒步在進城去的一條馬路上，從我底身旁走過了一位瘦弱的女子，她底太瘦的身體一看上去就有着病態，但是這一個背像與走路的姿勢是多麽的熟悉啊！我因為是無目的散步，她已走在我前面二三丈了，我略跨大了步子追上去，脚步聲驚動了她，她回過頭來，露出了驚喜的神情：「噫！烱，是你嗎？」我略一辨認，在她底瘦削的左頰上我尋到了一顆獨特的紅痣，「啊！英子，是你！」我實在可說是不認識她了，如果不是她那一顆鮮明的記印。她變得太多了，誰能相信目前這個生命力已被奪去了大半的女子就是從前那麽活潑健康的英子呢？從前曾鈎起了我底熱愛的她，雖然我也只嘗到點單戀的滋味，但我是一直在懷念着她祝福着她的啊！立在她底面前，我底內心充滿着一種複雜得難以名出的情緒，慚腆，悲哀惋惜……我用激動的手握住了她底骨瘦的手，我感到她也在顫動。我曾記得這隻手從前是健壯的，當我握住它時她常會使勁地抽出去，但今天她却儘它無力地躺在我底手中，我看到她底眼睛潤濕了。</p>
<p>「烱！你還會認識我嗎？離開了十年了呢！」</p>
<p>「我怎麽會忘記你呢？不過你和從前是差得太多了，怎麽會這樣消瘦呢？」我看她兩頰上的肉完全消失了，一對大眼睛陷進去，呆滯滯地，看起人來像失去了光彩。</p>
<p>「我也不知道」，她像不願多說話。「現在時間已不早了，我下半天到你家裏來看你好嗎？」我看見她腋下的一疊　子，我知道她一定是在敎書，我不忍追問她往事，我想她底內心已　着沉重的悲哀了，於是我吿訴了她的地址，她怱怱地走了，我看着她底淸瘦的背影，我為她感到了生命力消逝的傷心。記得從前我們在一塊時，她還是一個高中一的學生，我也還在C大學讀書，因為我和幾個朋友組織了一個課餘讀書會，由一個友人的介紹，她也加入了，剛來時她完全是個舊家庭中的好孩子，溫文靜雅，沉默寡言，除了讀書，她什麽都不知道，然而她底身體是豐腴健康的。以後她漸漸地學習了很多的知識，不到一年，她完全改變了一個樣子，她有着很强的判別力，理解力與記憶力，再加上她的努力，她底社會知識特越地進步着，她很會說話了，能够在大庭廣衆間滔滔地演說，能够勇敢地批評，也會寫成洋洋洒洒的論文，她有着健爽明朗的性格，做起事來敏捷週到，任何一個朋友都認為她是一個極有希望的孩子，而且她還有着一副討人歡喜的甜甜的面孔，會中的友人們都對她有着很好的友誼。我不敢相自己的一切有着過人的地方，但是因為我住的地方和她接近，因此我倆硏討談話的機會也比較多，由此我倆的感情也更融洽點，雖然她底年紀要比我小到五六歲，最初我固然可以給她點指示，但不久她不特能了解我的思想，有時　會給我以鼓勵與警惕了。　的，她是那麽的聰明，其實她那時還只是一個十五六歲的孩子呢，她已經什麽都懂得了，和她在一起談話時總使人感到快活爽然。雖然她不愛修飾，但她所表現出的一種自然的少女的活潑，更使人感到最純潔的眞美。</p>
<p>後來我們會裏又開辦了民衆夜校，她担任了婦女部的主要工作，我倆每晚踏着夜色歸來，有時我們浸在皎潔的月色中，隨談隨走，彼此的心是很接近的，當然在這種情形中，誰都會原諒我有着愛她的心情吧？她是多麽够使人敬愛的姑娘啊！我相信我們將來一定能够在事業上獲得相互的幫助的。只是我有一個表妹，算是我的未婚妻，她因為沒有父母，一直在我家裏，因此當我向她求愛時，她不肯接受，她說「烱，請你別提這些煩人的事情吧！我倆的感情，本來很好的，你如果一定要說起這些事，我倒反會和你疏遠了。」這眞叫我怎麽好呢？從前當我不曾對她說過我愛她時，我倆走在無月色的夜中，她會很自然的倚在我身旁，我緊握住她的手，她也會握得我很緊；但後來我握住她時却總要從我手中抽去了，我不能相信她不愛我，我直率的問她，她說：「我像愛自己的哥哥一樣的愛你，不可以嗎？」我吿訴她，我那個表妹字也不識幾個，我根本不曾愛過她，解除婚約是很便　的。」但是當我和她說到這些時，他就會離得我遠遠地，我問她為什麽：他說：「我們這樣做朋友，也不很開心嗎？將來你結了婚，在事業上我們仍舊可以携手前進，大家都很快活，如果你　了一個可憐的女孩子反而大家煩惱了，我絕對不願你這樣任性，何况我已很滿足現在的友情，不再需要進一步的愛了。」我能對她再說什麽呢？也許她還只是一個孩子吧？把事情想得這樣簡單，也可以說她太民事了，想得這樣週到。她在任何一種觀點塲合她都能了解我，只是在這點上她似乎有意不了解我。我知道她雖然看上去性格很强，但她却有着一顆悲天憫人的心，她簡直不曾苛　過一個人，對一切不幸的人她都能原諒，她愛家庭，愛朋友愛人類，她更愛護女同胞們。正因為她底心太柔和了，也是她的弱點，她常會給情感超過了理智，軟化在母親的眼淚下，我時常說他還欠勇敢；但她却又不曾見憐於我一顆熱愛她的心，多麽怪僻的一個女孩子啊！只有在我離開她的前夕，她還是為了家庭的　絆不能回去，她為我流了眼淚，我趁着這機會大胆地吻了她，她並不曾如我所料的拒絕我，我問她，她說：「旣然就要分別了，我何必再吝嗇這一點而使你難受呢？我又不曾恨過你！」多麽够使我回味的話啊！</p>
<p>以後　烟隔絕了我們的音訊，但是我從不曾間斷過對她的憶念與祝福的，我一直相信她是一個可以為人類發揮一點力量的新女性。</p>
<p>相逢後的這天下午，她找到了我的家裏，我看到她那病弱的身體，悲痛佔據了我，我實在不敢再向她什麽了；還是她自動的吿訴了我：她底多病的父親已死去八年了，留下了母親和二個弟妹，她不得不中止了正要到遠方去工作的計劃，負起了家庭的重担，於是她敎書了，同時她不願放棄社會活動，又要忙着民衆夜校及各種事務，後來生活指數日高，她每天要不停的工作，尙且不能使一家溫飽，周圍的環境越來越惡劣，她的憤恨也越來越强烈，她有着狂沸的熱情，她有着鬥爭的精神，但她又熱烈地愛着她的母親和弟妹們，不能毅然幹她要幹的社會工作，她仍輾轉在家庭的重担下，加上生活的煎熬，她終於病上了，生了肺病，她仍需要不停的工作，她底愛憎也更汹湧，她更活動於社會事業，但病也就日漸加深了。可憐她縱有着堅勇的精神，滿腔的熱力，仍敵不了病魔的侵襲，現在她巳是個深期的肺病患者了，她對我說話的時候常要咬緊了牙齒，有時也會揑緊了拳頭，我知道她底內心是痛苦極了，我對她有着極大的惋惜，大家都對她抱着很大的熱望的一個新靑年健將啊，怎麽就輕輕地給滅了呢？我同情她悲憐她，敬愛她，我太激動了，我忘記了一切，我恨不能以我的熱情去救助她，我要去吻她，但她將我用力地推開了，說：「我已經完結了，我們已走在不同的路上了，你還有很多的事要去做，你應該去創造，難道你也要毀滅自己嗎？」我瞠目地看看她，難道她眞的完結了嗎？我底心像壓在一個重量的下面，那是她底影子，漸漸地沉下去，沉下去，我知道這顆彗星是不會發光的了！</p>
<h3 id="c60">不平凡的邂逅 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 王希堯</p>
<p>有一天將近中午的時候，我從學校裏放出來，在靜安寺路踱着，看見一家橱窗裏的絲襪很是中意，於是走了進去。那是一家很時髦的服飾店，一個肥胖的外國老太小大概是店主，還是幾位年輕的女店員。</p>
<p>其中一位女店員很能眩人耳目，穿着很緊窄的花綢旗袍，望上去頗有「亭亭玉立」之感，臉上擦了大量的脂粉，還畫着藍色的眼圈，美麗中帶有幾分妖氣，眞是典型的「花瓶」。</p>
<p>當我吿訴了她所要的東西後，她就拿出兩匣讓我挑選，我問她九寸的有沒有，她非常溫和的吿訴我九寸是太小了，男子普通都着九寸半，又注視我的脚，說我着九寸是再適合也沒有了，她這種體貼而柔美的態度，使我略覺不安，一方面佩服那外國老太波用這樣好的女店員，眞能招徠顧客。</p>
<p>我正在揀擇的時候，她却注意起我放在玻璃櫃台上的一本紅皮面燙金字的「中國外交史」，她問我：「你也唸政治的？」這話使我奇怪，一個女店員怎麽會管起顧客唸的書呢？而她裝滿脂粉的腦袋裏怎會「政治」和「經濟」影子呢？我　然答應了一聲，想不出用什麽話來反問她，她又說：「我們不用這種本子。」我更奇怪，難道她也唸書的嗎？乃問她：「你也是唸政治的嗎？貴校是？」她點點頭，吿訴了我校名，還說：「學校裏要五點以後上課，白天在這裏做些事，」我說：「那我們是同志啦！」她笑笑，臉上浮起梨渦般的笑　，問我貴姓，並希望多多指敎。</p>
<p>我買好了東西，她送我出來，我瞥見她脚上穿着最新型的蛇皮的皮鞋，絲襪里還　着一隻金鐲子。</p>
<p>在歸途上，我懷疑着，這樣艷媚的少婦，人家一定以為是操着某種職業的，怎會是堂堂大學生呢？她又為了什麽要假借大學的名義呢？</p>
<p>在强烈的好奇心之下，一個傍晚，我踏進了某大學。</p>
<p>敎室里，那里有這樣艷媚的小姐呢？但在偶然一剎那，我瞧見她了，但使我吃驚的是她的模樣完全跟那天兩樣，甚至使我疑心是面孔想像的另外一個人。</p>
<p>她穿了天藍色的布旗袍，白色的跑鞋，多麽潔素，多麽文靜，正在用心的抄筆記。</p>
<p>「前後判若兩人，」我在走廊中徘徊，下課鈴響了，學生們從敎室里出來。</p>
<p>我正想走，已被她看見了。</p>
<p>「咦，密司脫五……」她把不曾敷脂粉的臉蛋對着我。</p>
<p>「下課了嗎？」我覺得有些不好意思，不得不撒一句謊說明來意，「我來看一個同學。」</p>
<p>「誰呀？」她問。</p>
<p>「他……他沒有來。」我心中有些窘。</p>
<p>「那麽我們回去吧！」</p>
<p>我們一同走下了樓梯，踏入囂鬧的市街，終於在她的家的弄堂口握別了。</p>
<p>第二天，我乘街車又經過那家時髦的服飾店，我好奇地注意一下，隔　玻璃窗，我又瞥見臉上　了大量脂粉還畫着藍色眼圈的她。一陣迷惘襲擊着我的心頭。</p>
<p>我不禁為職業女子悲哀了。</p>

<p>中葡盃足球聯賽，中華對葡萄牙在月之二十六日（本週二）下午五時三刻在跑馬廳球塲舉行。按第一塲葡隊勝，第二塲則中華隊勝，此賽爲爭奪之焦點，無怪兩隊俱用最理想之陣綫，一反前兩戰之草率從事，其雄心可以監矣。</p>
<p>上期本刋載有必賢君之　義，對中華之陣容，內有在被黜中之賈幼良等名字，當時余頗以爲怪，及至足聯會有特赦，准予賈等參加，則我知必賢君之貢獻，固在無形中早具此深意，足聯當局誠意採納，乃能奪得全功，以二對〇净勝萄萄牙，抱得錦標歸來，誠屬可喜可賀，茲略叔簡情，並作評述。</p>
<p>中華在上半時中，除上塲極度進展外，惜以聯絡不佳，及射門乏人，終至功虧一簣，而葡隊乃佔絕對上風中。因李天生莊友仁等之實力，亦均徒成　餅，各無所獲。下半時中華李義臣先得一球，但以許文奎越位無效，旋葡商麥其當亦得一球，亦因軍脫脫遜越位作廢，可謂巧合之事。匯後賴韓龍海之充沛長力，連獲兩球，奠定勝利。使初度恢復中葡盃，即人我中華之手。</p>
<p>中華勢力卒獲勝利</p>
<p>總評是役，極鮮精彩鏡頭。蓋雙方似均有生疏之嫌，純熟之連絡，及兇猛之脚頭，不多見也。論雙方之情形，均爲守勝於攻。從戰情中所以零到守衛均具破壞對方攻的連繫。而攻的均未能謀所以破之大道。於是在雙方攻勢均不銳利中，精彩自爾減削於無形中矣。中華隊之終勝者，則還在一致努力所得。如孟義具之前呼後應，李天生之注力於福恩，俱有超然成功，博得球迷稱怪。葡隊之敗因，最顯著者，爲下半時以考司担任之調許而茲爲籌成大錯，緣許乃後衛人材，突以前衛而試，以致漏洞百出，乃使賈韓之間，大爲活躍。夫葡隊素以有智調度有方稱，此番不知何以會有失着之舉，誠令人莫名其妙矣。</p>
<p>華隊隊員表演頗佳</p>
<p>致論各各技術，張邦綸較以往爲穩健，能不失球，殊堪嘉獎。李天生能關　　恩，老當益壯，非易事也。孟義良在潭福楨宋靈　變缺席下，　中堅要職，前呼後應，頭顯是道，似不在兩人之下。郁黎明有速度之奔跑，在中衛綫上常需乎此。韓龍海能獨獲而球，其功常不可沒。而韓之竄勢，具威脅敵方之眞實性，尤爲不可抹殺之事。賈幼良多數時間與韓龍海對調，作返陣帶球，最見辛勤。李義臣一洗　勁，故雖有生疏之象，能如此努力，誠值得一書。許文奎之左翼，其給予攻門之一記，淸浙美麗。韓籠海之獲第二球，即由于許文產之配給球而來。餘如莊友仁張林根，高保正羅籌福等果無精粹演出，尚能保持水準耳。</p>
<p>葡隊方面絕少生色</p>
<p>隊方　，是以奧列維拉爲　佳，八面威風。次則以V蘇君之活躍及應作冷箭之射，予我隊以威脅。　恩爲我方關煞，未展雄血，潘脫遜昆仲，亦以興福恩一少契　，黯然無生色也。考斯　穩健有加，不悉下半時之何以令其下塲耶？許而茲萊潦之雨前衛，俱有勇過而智不足之　，不足取也。後衛柯業脫較維克泰爲佳，維一副老腔，殊惹人討厭。</p>
<p>塲內秩序應加注意</p>
<p>最後筆者另有所感，即塲內觀衆過多，最有缺點者，即球門兩旁站立無數觀衆，將球門圍得重重疊疊，故時有令裁判有莫從判決之苦。如此賽中韓龍海之進第一球，對方潘里米急從網門取出，而同時球迷因欣喜過度，有進球門綫左右而雀躍者，乃爲對方籍口引起糾紛，而裁判亦確有在人　中，難以決斷之苦，此其大　者。次者，在大看台之大衆球迷，旣以消費力爲弱，無可奈何，在遼遠之視綫中觀看，要亦準球迷，必不爲此。但輙以場內人士之將球場保　，乃造成最精湛之鏡頭以致無欣賞機會，爲掃與之事。　筆者亦係大看台之一份十，屢在此情形中叫苦連天。蓋極多時問在空歡喜及空懐喪中，實以球門相近之球，實無從觀察及也。故極希望當局對塲內看客應加以限制。如謂影響收入，我不敢反抗。則對于秩序，應知所維持。換言之，即球門畔應絕對禁止站立觀衆，庶幾有益于大看合之準球迷，亦所以使此賽減少無謂之糾紛也。悉足聯會方面正在夏令足球邀請實，屆時務盼對于此一點，鄭重考慮，勿輕而忽略之，則萬幸矣。</p>
<h3 id="c63">不堪回首話網球　中實網球會　將舉辦義賽 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 梅</p>
<p>網球是合乎夏季的遝動，但是一二年來，這種運動，簡直有無聲無息的情形，以至本年度，更是被人認爲貴族化的遝動，而沒有辦法去享受。事實上這項運動，一向比校其他爲高貴。但是，過去還可能勉强購買網球，待至今夏，在這物價沸朧聲中，網球一物，也隨着物價一樣的步步高　。據我所曉得的，一隻網球的代價，要近拾萬元的數目。如此－試想，豈是一般人所熊辦到，這原因當然是講買力量薄弱下的必然現象，這樣成爲埋沒了不少個中健將，更使一項合乎時令的運動應伏　，無能發展。</p>
<p>按我國對於網球發輕得本來極遲，好像從第八屆遠東運動中邱飛海（已故）林寶　獲得了冠軍以後，方引起國人增厚的興趣，那時候當然還沒有普遍。以後便漸漸的普遍起來，而國人也漸漸地注意。於是逐漸發現了不少人材，像鄭兆伏許承基的後輩英雄，其球　都能揚威海外。尤其許承基的水準，竟然趕上世界舞台上，這顯然表現出我國正有此項球類運動的天材。八年前的世界名角鐵爾登梵恩斯曾過海上表演，也增高了當時觀衆的水準。雖然，許多球員窺學得個中門經，但是惜乎這項貴族化運動，一天天貴族起來，而成了望球興嘆的現象。</p>
<p>在本年的現實下，我人也一點不想有此項消息的記述了。但是晴天霹靂，有一個好消息傳來，使我們幾乎忘懷的運動，將有偶一欣賞的機會。當然，這一定是像曇花一現的佳作，但唯其如此，應該格外覺得其可貴，何况道究竟是合乎時令的運動呀？那便是中實網球會將在最近期內有一次網球義賽，當然是受人歡迎，而且是有益善舉的義賽。現在我想來把中實會的一切簡單地作一介紹。</p>
<p>中實網球會組織情形</p>
<p>中實網球會，是中國實業協會會員所組織，該會幾乎把海上網球的第一　選手都羅致殆盡。反　來說，有一手好網球的　兒們正苦沒有機會來試身手，有這樣的機會，自然趨之若鶩，集同好於一處。中實會有着健全的組隊，由林康侯爲會長，吳庸庵徐文照馬潤芳担任副會長，李磊石是總幹事，副總幹事是唐士箴令　章，這幾位都是能幹的人材，是則中實網球會的碩果僅存於滬壇，而且有這毅力來辦一塲義賽。</p>
<p>滬上網球將羅致殆盡</p>
<p>再看該會所列隊員有周冠軍的隊長，將士爲王文正·陶冠球·魏詩蓀·王際昌。經茂卿。許承位·郭鷹·經仁卿。蕭學海·蔡國基·張定釗。葉惟儉·李磊石·孫炎·范文采。孟廣明·金　章·張肖龍等，當然一望而知老將咸集。新人來歸，可稱網球員的集中營了。其中最爲人所注意的便是王文正和陶冠球，前者咤叱風雲的威名，是有歷史的。但陶冠球本來是一位職業選手，自從在香港恢復了業餘資格後，賴其年事正靑，所以球藝有登峯造極之成績，縱橫海上，幾無敵手，但是他和王文正從來沒有正式交手過。據說，這一次義賽中，他們兩人已同意獨壘一下，於是王陶之謎，雖能執滬　網球壞的牛耳，可以解決。而長久沒有精彩網球賽的球迷，終不會放棄這絕好的機會。又如局冠軍。李磊石·張定釗等，都是名手。蔡國基許承位，後起之秀，我想在這一塲義賽中，我們一定能像久旱逢甘雨的欣賞一番。</p>
<p>券資所得充助學金</p>
<p>至於這次義賽的目的，是所得券賢，將悉數捐助新聞報及本報作助學金，加惠淸寒學子，誡值得提携的！</p>
<p>最後，我想介紹一下該網球塲的大概，地址是在五原路（趙主教路）二八五號中國實業協會內，交通並不十分便利。趁電車到善鐘路，沿五原路朝西最多五分鐘的路程，場子是最　準的，塲地經過最考究的　　，所以彈力方面是適合極了。更值得寫的一邊是有　成蔭，所以在有微風的時候，坐在場　　球員表演，　是含有納涼的風味。所屬爲缺憾者，則四邊容納觀衆的空隙並不多，則　時難免有使一部人向關的。</p>
<p>現在，我不想多談，待該會有進展的消息時，下一期再作報告吧！</p>
<h3 id="c64">棒球界前輩梁扶初談滬上棒壘球運動　－七月四日中日壘球會戰－ <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 描</p>
<p>本屆綴球聯賽，華人勁旅熊貓隊教練梁扶初君，乃我國棒球界老前輩。查梁君十五歲時，即在日本任棒球選手，會數度代表中華隊在日木比賽及爲遠運代表。梁君近三十年來，歷在日本香港上海担任棒球指導，著名於時。本屆聯賽，熊貓隊自得梁君任指導後，技術猛進。筆者慕其名，特訪梁君於共私寓，暢淡滬上棒壘球運動之狀况，茲將訪問經過錄之如下。</p>
<p>滬上棒球運動正在發展時代</p>
<p>梁君首稱，近年來關人對於棒壘球已漸生興趣，此乃極好之現象。因我國運動素來落後。除足籃球較爲普遍外，棒壘球運動鮮爲國人所注意。此實有提倡之必要。在遠運會中，國人之棒球與日菲比較，眞是大巫見小巫。最近二三年來於夏季，有西人主辦之壘球聯賽，國人加入者僅熊貓隊。據梁君積四十年之經騐，對現今滬上各隊之棒壘球技術之觀察，則謂尙在幼稚時期，但將來必能發達。具其於將來國際之關係，棒壘球運動必將凌駕足籃球之上，此乃梁君所斷言者。是故梁君首先希望報界及體育界對揮壘球極力提倡，其次希騵國人多組織棒壘球隊，利用比賽以提高技術及興趣。末後梁君復謂，彼將組織一棒球會，訓練後進，使我國之棒球能如足籃球之普遍及發達，使將夾國際棒球界上我國亦佔相當之地位也。</p>
<p>各隊短擊防守尙少精密訓練</p>
<p>上星期日（二十四）熊貓本與菲僑比賽，後菲隊臨時誤印，改由熊貓隊與日僑及西靑之混合隊作友誼賽。是日觀象達數千人，華隊在梁君之戰術指導下，以八比四大勝。是賽混合隊以最理想之陣容出戰，如投手凱捷密洛夫，捕手勃克及三浦，游擊植島等名將，在第三局時，混合隊以二比零佔先。至第四局華隊王念祖得一「二壘打」，後田捕手王秀山擊出一中　高球「　牲打」，使王念　　壘獲一分。至第五局，混合隊以佳妙之擊球得「滿壘」（Po　ll　base）且又無出局（No　down）在此危局下，輪至寇利擊球，彼全力一揮擊出一急球被游擊梁友擊接任，而在二壘之毛斯被桀友聲以球觸身出局，後梁君復急　三綴使野上出局，此一三殺（Triple　kill）鏡頭，淸晰迅速，博得數聲不少。此時局勢一變，教練梁君急指導華隊利用短攻，果也在第五局，華隊由梁友義·溫瑞雄·溫天華·李啓　·連續利用短擊上壘獲分血轉敗爲勝矣。是賽梁君謂，滬上各隊對於短擊防守技術尚少訓練，如能利用短擊必致他隊慌張混亂，故是賽華隊亦用短擊，致混合隊諸將窮於應付，終致陣脚淩亂，被華隊乘虛而入矣。梁君復調在壘球賽中，進攻宜多用短擊，蓋壘球不如棒球之堅實，擊出之球十九爲外翼所接。此觀乎星期四熊貓戰武士時，華隊之勝，全賴短擊取勝。是賽華隊防守精密，溫瑞雄在第六局中得一「全壘打」，而在四五諸局中，華隊頻施短棒，上壘如走馬燈，結果以十二比〇大勝之，此亦梁君指導之結果也。</p>
<p>球隊能否勝利端賴戰鬥精神</p>
<p>梁君末稱，在編棒球比賽時最重戰鬥精神，此乃經驗之談。同憶民十九每在日本橫濱市中日錦標決賽時，至最後一局日本仍以一分佔先，後中華隊經梁君再三指導督戰後，卒賴最後一分鐘之戰鬥精神得一「全壘打」而反敗爲勝。是故梁君謂球賽能否勝利，以有否戰鬥之精神爲斷，而球藝尚屬其次也。故其所指導之球隊，臨陣均鎭靜從事，例如熊貓隊作戰時，某次梁友聲任投手。因脚部抽筋，教練梁君仍不許換人代替。某次捕手面部已傷，仍不許退塲，須作戰到底　蓋恐動搖單心，而致一敗隨地。梁君之重戰鬥精神，在香港亦復著各，該地西報稱梁君爲「祖父」。（Graudpa　Liang）蓋每次比賽時，梁若必到場督戰，諄　善誘，一如老人之教誨也。</p>
<p>七月四日下午熊貓將戰日僑</p>
<p>下星期四（七月五日）在霞飛路潘聲路（吳興路）俄體會球塲下午四時時半，熊貓將遇本屆聯賽最強之日僑隊，此戰有關將來錦標，兩隊技藝不相上下。據梁君觀察日隊攻勝於守，蓋如左擊手　島及三浦。野上。蘇若等均善擊。此擊留美日僑，作風與美人相同，作戰時動作　擅，英語連　。現梁君知悉日僑隊已知悉愼防華隊利用短擊，故將改變戰　。是戰雙方必盡表　之能事，此一幕國際球賽，並不收門票，必將吸引大量球迷也。賽前三時起熊貓乙隊與蘇維埃比賽，此二隊實力亦　堅強，亦將有一番劇戰也。</p>
<h3 id="c65">圓門球　規則修訂之我見（二） <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 狄憲章</p>
<p>按第九章比賽術語及其解釋中，僅有二十一項之規定，但若攻隊之前銼，運球至對區中，向球門進攻時，因守隊之後衛利用保衛之正當技巧，不克進攻緊，在有先數次之比賽中，攻隊之前銼輒因之而利用奔跑之快動作，將球拋回本　，使守隊之鋒及衛疲於奔跑而達於進攻之完成，此項技巧，在兩隊之實力不目上下時還用之，則精彩致頻頻而作；惜乎兩隊之實力往往微分高低，則易形成「棋高」着，縛手縛脚」之勢，於是勝者更盛，敗者更餒，利益不相均等，遂指定「攻隊進攻至對區後，未曾射門之前，不得退回後堪，」井規則罰則如下：「退回後塲時成爲死球，由對隊之球員在球落後塲之地點附近邊綫外，將球擲進球塲，機續比賽，」但球落後塲之際爲對隊球員獲得時，不得判爲退回後場。</p>
<p>持球三秒鐘</p>
<p>此項違例　自美國籃球規則，而加以修改，蓋攻隊之球員進攻時，不論在本區或對區中，不得持球不動歷三秒鐘，否則，在發生違例處之最近邊綫外，由對隊隊員除外擲球進塲，繼續比賽。此項遠例之規定，發見於攻隊進攻時，在本區或對區中，突然停止進攻，俟對隊之隊員立定位置後，再行利用地位突然繼續進攻，使對隊之隊員，措手不及，而陷於必敗之境。兼之此項技巧發生在比數相等之時，尤爲多見。於是乃有持球一。秒鐘之違例指定。</p>
<p>雙手拍球</p>
<p>在原有之規則第九章比賽術語及其解釋第十七種「還球」項下：「球員獲球後，將球或擲或拍或滾，未經第二人接觸前，再行觸球，謂之數球」。雖并未明文規定用一手或雙手，但事實上，除　球外，無論拍或滾，均用一手。若用雙手，則在事實上，即爲違例。且同時　乎拍球或雙手交換拍球，亦屬違例，罰則與籃球同</p>
<p>上列之四項，均已進正，儿各球隊之球員會參加杯賽者，均能熟諳之矣。下列各項，僅屬鄙見，是否有當，還希錢者旭滄，各裁判及前輩先生，加以指正，則幸甚矣！</p>
<p>各項球戯常因體力之强弱而分甲乙組，使之運動而能充分表演技巧，並絲毫不損健康，已往之圓門球比賽中，球場之大小，球員出塲之人數，在男子方面，甲乙組相同。但鄙意以爲甲組球員，發育完全，體力强健，根據錢君指定之規則第一章球塲之附註第三絛中謂：「大型球塲之面積及比賽人數同足球」，則甲組球隊應用足球塲及足球出塲人數。幻想中，必能多得精彩之處。乙組球員發育並未完全，即發育已至完全之境，而技術遜人一　時，則應採用小型足球之球塲及出塲人數。在女子方面，生現上不允許過分　烈運動，是以亂意主張採用錢衛分區制，即前　永遠在　區，不得進入本區（開球時除外）由三衛永遠在本區，不得侵入劃區。與女子籃球規則之規定相同，至於其他各項規則，亦應多多採用女子籃球規則，使之合乎生理，即球場之大小，應採用小橡皮球之球場爲宜，此其一。</p>
<p>比賽時間在原有之規則中，規定男子方面，每比賽之實際時間爲四十分鐘，全局分爲上下二半時，每半時爲二十分鐘，兩半時間，休息十分鐘；女子及初中學童之年齡，全局應改爲三十二分鐘，每半時爲十六分鐘，兩半時間休息十分鐘。鄙意以爲申報球員照原文，乙組球員應改爲上下二半時，每半時更分二節，每節十分鐘，兩節間休息五分鐘。女子及初中學童之年齡者亦分四節，每節八分鎭，第一節第二節間休息三分鐘，第三節第四節間亦休息三分鐘，上下半時間，休息十分鐘，此其二（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Imperial Tour of Northern Jiangsu to Express Concern for the People's Suffering; Acting Chairman Chen Summoned Military and Political Leaders in Yangzhou and Taizhou Yesterday for Instructions After Returning to Nanjing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - With Northern Jiangsu being a crucial area for anti-communist efforts, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government is deeply concerned about the military and political situation and the hardships of the people there. He departed from Nanjing on the 28th of this month for an inspection tour of the area. Accompanying him were Cen Deguang, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council; Zhou Longxiang, Director of the Adjutant's Office; Lu Ying, Chief Aide-de-Camp; Guo Xiufeng, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council; Lin Ji, Senior Adjutant; He Junliang, and others, as well as Major General Asakai, the Supreme Military Advisor from the Allied Nations. He arrived in Yangzhou at noon that day, where he summoned senior officials of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters and generals of the Second War Area for instructions. In the evening, he arrived in Taizhou and stayed there. On the morning of the 29th, he inspected the troops and gave instructions, earnestly lecturing on the two major domestic and foreign policies of realizing unification through anti-communism and striving for independence and liberation through participation in the war. All officers and soldiers who heard this were greatly inspired. He returned to Yangzhou on the same day at noon and safely returned to the capital at 4:30 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection of Yangzhou</p>
<p>At approximately 8:00 AM on the 28th, Acting Chairman Chen departed from Xiaguan by car amidst heavy rain to Yangzhou. Dozens of people accompanied him. When he departed, all senior officials of the central government were present at the station to see him off. At 10:30 AM, the car arrived in Zhenjiang, where Sun Liangcheng, Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification, led senior officials at the station to respectfully welcome the Chairman. They then boarded pre-arranged cars and drove to the pier. Along the road from the station to the pier, military police, officials, students, and civilians stood to greet and pay their respects. At 10:45 AM, they boarded a special ferry to cross the river. The weather was clear that day, and the water was calm. At 11:30 AM, they safely arrived at Liuwei on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, where officials and representatives of the people from Yangzhou had already gathered to welcome them. The Chairman disembarked and boarded a car, led by guards, followed by others in military vehicles in an orderly fashion. After traveling over 20 li, they arrived at the city and entered through the Victory Arch. Inside and outside the city gate, more than 10,000 civilians and students stood along both sides of the avenue, holding flags and shouting slogans of support. Flags were hung along the route, and slogans were posted, including "Support Acting Chairman Chen to implement the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction," "Support Acting Chairman Chen to eliminate the evil communists," and "Support Acting Chairman Chen to relieve the suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu." After the motorcade entered the city, it went to the government office to rest briefly. At 12:30 PM, a meeting was convened for instructions for party and government officials.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Instructions</p>
<p>First, he explained the purpose of his visit to Northern Jiangsu, which was to understand the actual situation of suppressing the communists in Northern Jiangsu and whether the military and political facilities were in line with the needs of the current situation. The other purpose was to declare that the central government's national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction remains unchanged, encouraging the generals to strengthen their beliefs, trust the central government, and cooperate with the national policy. He then laid out two tasks for the next two days. The first was to intensify anti-communist efforts, because the Nationalists and Communists cannot coexist. The existence of the Communist Party not only endangers the Kuomintang but also hinders the survival of the country and the nation. Northern Jiangsu is a place where the communists have entrenched themselves, and we should intensify our efforts to eliminate them to eradicate their remaining forces. The second was the issue of participating in the Greater East Asia War. China's participation in the war was originally voluntary, not an opportunistic move. Furthermore, opposing Anglo-American imperialism is the legacy of the Founding Father. While striving for China's independence and freedom, we should also strive for freedom and equality for the nations of East Asia. At this point, he recounted the oppression suffered by East Asia from Anglo-American imperialists over the past century and explained the inside story of the San Francisco Conference and the ambitions of Britain and the United States. China's participation in the war has always been a consistent policy of our country's revolution against aggression, and success or failure is not a consideration. Finally, he clarified the world situation with profound meaning. The instructions lasted for 30 minutes. After the instructions, Director Sun led the shouting of slogans, and then everyone went to the government office to rest. At 1:00 PM, Director Sun of the Pacification hosted a banquet at the Yangzhou Society Restaurant and invited Allied generals to accompany them. During the banquet, Director Sun presented a speech to the Chairman, stating that Northern Jiangsu was determined to sincerely support the central government and expressing their determination to oppose communism. The Chairman gave instructions, encouraging the generals to fight for anti-communist efforts. All the attendees were greatly inspired. The banquet ended at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Military Review in Taixian</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, he departed by car for Taizhou. The Yangzhou-Taizhou highway was a total of 70 li, and the journey took about 2 hours. Along the way, the fields were fertile for thousands of li, and pillboxes could be seen scattered around, indicating the solid defenses of the area. Since the outbreak of the incident, the communists had taken the opportunity to rise up and spread throughout Northern Jiangsu, and the people suffered greatly. Now, under the efforts of the Pacification Headquarters and the Second War Area, the communists are becoming less and less visible, shattering the communists' earlier boast of making Northern Jiangsu a "second Yan'an," leaving them scattered and fleeing. The Chairman praised this greatly. At 6:00 PM, he arrived in Taixian, where all senior generals of the Second War Area, including Sun as the concurrently-serving Commander-in-Chief, local officials, students, and Allied military personnel, stood along the road to welcome him, holding banners and shouting slogans, similar to what was seen in Yangzhou. At 6:05 PM, he arrived at the government office to rest and then summoned senior generals of the Second War Area to listen to their reports and give instructions. At 8:00 PM, a dinner was held. The Chairman earnestly expressed his concern that the imperial tour would cost the local area too much and encouraged Commander-in-Chief Sun to cherish material resources and avoid extravagance. Commander-in-Chief Sun listened attentively. The banquet ended at around 9:00 PM, and at 10:00 PM, everyone rested. A heavy rain began in the evening and did not stop all night. At 7:30 AM on the 29th, he went to review the troops. At that time, the heavy rain had just stopped, and the field was muddy, but the soldiers were in high spirits. Sun Yutian, Commander of the 38th Division, served as the commander, and the three regiments being reviewed were well-equipped. First, the Chairman was invited to inspect the field for a week, and then soldiers from each platoon performed drills, including bayonet training and boxing, which were all very exciting. After the drills were completed, the Chairman was invited to give instructions. (The main points of the instructions were the same as those given in Yangzhou and will not be recorded separately.) Finally, Commander-in-Chief Sun led the shouting of slogans, and the sounds of "Support Acting Chairman Chen," "Support the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction," "Long live the Chairman," and "Long live the Republic of China" were deafening. From this, it can be seen that the local people sincerely support the central government and Acting Chairman Chen.</p>
<p>Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, he departed for Yangzhou. The people of that area, hoping for good harvests due to the heavy rain the night before, were overjoyed that the rain had come with the Chairman. Northern Jiangsu had been suffering from a prolonged drought, and after this heavy rain, agricultural prospects were promising, and the farmers were ecstatic, and not without reason. After the motorcade left Taixian city, as soon as it entered the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, accumulated water was seen everywhere, making it difficult for the cars to travel. However, the Chairman did not suffer from the hardships of the journey but instead often showed a happy expression. The great personality of the leader was deeply moving. At 12:30 PM, the car arrived in Yangzhou. At 12:30 PM, lunch was served. At 1:30 PM, he left Yangzhou and transferred to a special ferry at Liuwei to cross the river. At 2:50 PM, he arrived in Zhenjiang. At around 3:00 PM, he arrived at the station, and the train departed at 3:19 PM. At 4:30 PM, he safely arrived in the capital. Along the way, military officers and civilians from each area respectfully saw him off as before.

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Air Force Surprise Attack on Enemy Fleet off Balikpapan; Achieving Great Results with Dispersed Tactics <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 7th Squadron of the new Japanese Air Force, in order to annihilate the enemy's powerful fleet off Balikpapan, departed from the base on the evening of the 25th and launched a fierce surprise attack on the enemy fleet cruising about 40 kilometers east of Balikpapan. Braving intense anti-aircraft fire, the Japanese planes advanced to the skies above the enemy fleet and launched torpedo attacks one after another. So far, the confirmed results are the sinking of one large cruiser, three or more cruisers or destroyers, and one or more oil tankers. The enemy fleet attacked by the 7th Squadron was a powerful enemy naval force composed of three large cruisers, four large destroyers, and four small destroyers. The enemy minesweeper group had anchored 40 kilometers east of Balikpapan on the night of the 25th, forming a circular formation, and the 7th Squadron was able to achieve such great results by adopting dispersed surprise attack tactics. In addition, large fires were confirmed among the enemy fleet.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy fleet off Balikpapan, which was heavily damaged by a surprise torpedo attack by the Japanese on the 25th, is actively increasing its strength, and its actions appear extremely cautious. In addition to dispatching B24, B25, and P38 aircraft to fly over Japanese positions, it has also deployed minesweepers, submarine chasers, destroyers, and cruisers to carry out intense shelling, covering landing craft near the coastline and closely reconnoitering Japanese positions. On the 27th, enemy warships moved on the sea, including five heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, ten destroyers, more than twenty minesweepers and destroyer escorts, three oil tankers, and several transport ships. In addition, the number of landing craft had also increased compared to the previous day. Behind them, a ship resembling a seaplane carrier was cruising. The enemy's landing attempt in Balikpapan has become increasingly blatant.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Contradictions between the United States and the Chongqing Government with the Communists <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, newspapers published news of the Chinese Communist Party's criticism of the United States' policy of containment towards China, which is sufficient to illustrate the triangular contradictions between the Chongqing government with the Communists, and between the United States and the Chongqing government with the Communists.</p>
<p>Why did the Communist Party initially encourage the Nationalist Party to unite in resistance against Japan? It was because the Communist Party wanted to take advantage of the war of resistance to expand its own power and, further, to eliminate the power of the Nationalist Party and seize political power. The Communist Party's motives were impure. Why did the United States want to use Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party simultaneously to fight Japan? Standing from the position of capitalist imperialism, the United States has always attempted to seize the entire Chinese market in order to dump its goods and achieve its goals of economic aggression. Because it wants to dominate the entire Chinese market, it simultaneously makes the domestic forces in China weaken each other, reducing their independent strength, and uses seductive means to exclude other foreign forces. This position of American capitalist imperialism was obvious before the Sino-Japanese Incident and has become even more active since the incident. Therefore, the motives of the United States are also impure.</p>
<p>Starting from these two impure motives, cooperation between the two sides will certainly not last long, and contradictions will inevitably arise in the process of so-called "cooperation." Therefore, American assistance to the Chinese Communist Party is not absolute. The fact that the United States has two lines of policy toward China is very clear.</p>
<p>What we must pay attention to here is how to see through the consistent plan of the United States toward China in the two opposing lines of the United States toward China. Why did the United States adopt two policies? Very clearly, Chongqing is dissatisfied with the United States' sympathetic attitude toward the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party is also dissatisfied with the United States' helping Chongqing with most of its power. The Stilwell line and the Hurley line grasp only the superficial divergence in American views on Chinese policy. In fact, the United States has always had a consistent policy toward China in the past, present, and even in the future.</p>
<p>The cause of the Sino-Japanese Incident. When we look at the demands put forward by Stilwell, such as the "unification of Chinese anti-Japanese forces," the "lifting of Chongqing's blockade against the Chinese Communist Party, and the transfer of the blockading troops to the front lines," and "the United States' necessity to supply the Chinese Communist Party's troops with the minimum amount of necessary weapons," they are sufficient to fully demonstrate the ambitions of the United States!</p>
<p>The so-called Hurley line is to recognize Chongqing as orthodox, which is a consistent approach of the United States since the incident. At the same time, it can also explain the combination of Chongqing and American forces. Because many of those in the Chongqing regime who call themselves the American faction have achieved considerable status in politics and formed considerable power, which the Chinese Communist Party cannot match. However, because the United States' motives for its policy toward China are impure, although it is very concerned about the friction between Chongqing and the Communists, it does not have the absolute determination and power to reconcile them.</p>
<p>In short, what we should recognize at this time and place is that the purpose of the United States' policy toward China is to obtain a priority market after the war. It does not want China to be unified, nor does it want China to be able to be independent and autonomous. It not only attempts to use the power of both Chongqing and the Communists to consume Japan's military power, but also to consume China's entire vitality. Due to this observation, the United States uses both Chongqing and the Communists, while the Chinese Communist Party is unwilling to be completely used by the United States, and Chongqing cannot get rid of the United States' shackles, forming a fragmented situation. In this contradictory situation between Chongqing and the Communists and between the United States and the two, we, standing from the position of the people, naturally need to open up an autonomous path. Therefore, "peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction" is the national policy of the National Government, which we believe is theoretically correct and appropriate. However, because the political power is insufficient, it cannot oppose communism, nor can it achieve comprehensive peace. Therefore, the path of the people's autonomy cannot be actively opened up. However, how to open up the path of the people's autonomy is undoubtedly the most distressing problem we feel today.</p>

<h3 id="e9">US Strengthens Economic Control over Chongqing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - The power of the United States to dominate Chongqing is gradually increasing, and all those who care about China's future are deeply worried. A Chongqing dispatch on June 26 broadcast an article titled "On the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater." The article, based on reports obtained from the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater, discussed the power of the headquarters to dominate China's production plans, currency, and finance, boastfully exaggerating the United States' power to dominate Chongqing. The article stated, "The US Military Headquarters in the China Theater also cooperates with the administration of areas occupied by the Chongqing military's offensive forces, integrating the Chinese economy with operations and establishing a more modern new organization." The organization and tasks of the so-called "G-5 Bureau" under the headquarters were reported. The so-called G-5 Bureau, located in Chongqing, is called the "nerve center whose activities affect any military action in China." It is divided into six departments: military supplies and distribution, production, purchasing, civilian economy, military government, and confidential. Its tasks are sixfold. First, "determining matters related to the lending of military supplies to China." Second, "developing China's industry to rapidly supply all military needs within China." Third, "purchasing materials and resolving China's taxation problems." Fourth, "controlling currency and prices." Fifth, "reviewing the suggestions of American advisors to various plans of the Chongqing government and transmitting them to the Chongqing government, and studying administrative plans for newly occupied areas." Sixth, "military liaison." Observing the organization and tasks of the G-5 Bureau, it is clear that based on the needs of the United States to promote its operational plans, it actively extends its power to the political and economic policies of the Chongqing side. In other words, economic policies such as China's industrial development issues and currency and price issues, and all kinds of policies of the Chongqing side, are currently being controlled and managed by the US Military Headquarters. It is not yet clear what kind of relationship and connection the above-mentioned G-5 Bureau has with the various agencies of the Chongqing side. However, the American domination of Chongqing, under the beautiful name of promoting Chongqing's "modernization," is gradually becoming stronger and more blatant, clearly exceeding the limits of current war necessities, and is gradually developing into the complete colonization of Chongqing by American monetary imperialism.</p>

<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>Concerning the Xiantian Dao (Way of Former Heaven)</p>
<p>When reporters arrived in Wuxi</p>
<p>When the reporters arrived in Wuxi, they interviewed three different groups regarding the Xiantian Dao: military and police authorities, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens. The intellectuals were the most moderate. Their criticism was that the Xiantian Dao's divine pronouncements and bizarre tales were absurd, but the Xiantian Dao had its own background for growth. The targets of the Xiantian Dao's resistance were tax officials, township and village chiefs, local bullies, etc. The composition of the Xiantian Dao was mostly farmers. If the farmers had no grievances or hatred with these people, they would definitely not resort to weapons. Therefore, to pacify the Xiantian Dao, one must start by eradicating corruption.</p>
<p>Some asked: What about the main criminal of the Xiantian Dao, Ni Zicai? In the reporter's view, his appearance is ordinary, and his conversation is unremarkable, honest, and courteous. Seeing someone so ordinary, one would not believe he committed such actions. Some said: "Some surprising actions are often done by ordinary, honest people."</p>
<p>Township Office's Method of Extortion</p>
<p>There is a district with twenty townships, each of which must pay 200,000 yuan monthly to their superiors.</p>
<p>The expenses of a certain township office are several times greater than those of the county government. The responsible persons of the township offices are mostly involved with multiple powers. The busiest work of the township office is dealing with these multiple powers. The reason for the township office's huge expenses is this busiest work.</p>
<p>The bad method of the township office to extort money is to use various names to raise supply fees. If the villagers resist, there are ways to deal with them at any time, arresting and severely torturing them.</p>
<p>When bandits come to the countryside, the villagers dare not report them. On the one hand, the bandits know and would kill them. At the same time, the result of reporting still leads to the loss of cigarettes, alcohol, firewood, and rice.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Farmers' Suffering</p>
<p>In the Wuxi countryside, there is the saying "poking the chamber pot." "Poking the chamber pot" refers to armed personnel, knowing that farmers like to hide gold and silver jewelry in chamber pots. Therefore, in groups of three or five, they often go to farmers' homes, finding chamber pots in corners and remote places. Once found, anything inverted or sealed is broken open at the bottom with wooden sticks to see what is inside.</p>
<p>In the countryside, there is no large-scale business. Here is an example: "Someone returned to their hometown and opened an oil shop in the countryside. After opening, the business was quite prosperous, but the supply fees were enormous. The monthly income only covered expenses. After the second month, several uninvited guests came to the shop, looking for the owner to split shares. The shop was originally a sole proprietorship. The owner argued with them. They took out shares with the same name as the shop's license and threatened the owner sternly, claiming that if they did not split shares, they would go to the troop headquarters to reason. As a result, someone was asked to intercede, and after repeatedly pleading, the matter was settled with 600,000 yuan."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, less than half a month later, the matter was heard by another party, and they came in a different way. Several armed people came, claiming that the shop's operation was improper. They kidnapped the owner and took him away. Then, after another round of crying and pleading, it was settled with 500,000 yuan. After these two blows, the shop owner quickly closed the shop and moved back to the city. As a result, most of the capital was lost.</p>
<p>Setting up checkpoints along the way seems to have become an open way for some military and police to make money. In one county, importing goods from the Yangtze River, just a few miles, there are thirteen checkpoints. A small boat needs to pay 2,000 yuan at each checkpoint. From the city to Suzhou, there are about 160 checkpoints, each requiring a similar amount. However, the above only refers to empty boats. If loaded with goods, it depends on the value of the goods and the payer's capability.</p>
<p>Prisoners and Others</p>
<p>Seeing the general situation of a certain county's administration: "The county's prison is dilapidated, the facilities are crude, it is difficult to avoid wind and rain in winter, and it affects hygiene in summer... The food ration for each prisoner is stipulated at 20 yuan per day, but in fact, it is far from enough. The government has to issue rice by name..." From the sentence "affects hygiene in summer," one can still imagine why former Minister of Justice Zhang passed away.</p>
<p>Many posters urging people to pay taxes are pasted in the tea houses and restaurants of Jiangyin. Here are a few examples, which show the difficulty of persuading people to pay taxes: "Paying grain taxes is a national duty," "Paying early is an honor, paying late is a shame," "Grain households should choose top-quality rice for paying taxes," "Mixing water and bad grain to pay taxes is a rogue."</p>

<p>To Brother Chen Gongbo, Acting Chairman in Nanjing: I have just learned that my mother, Madam Ma, passed away on June 25th in Guiyang. I have long neglected my duties to visit and care for her, and my guilt is profound. I have not personally tasted her medicine or attended to her funeral arrangements.

<h3 id="e18">The Economic Foundation of the British Empire is Shaken <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 29th – According to a London dispatch: In this war, Britain has not only lost all its overseas investments of one billion pounds, but also incurred foreign debts of 2.3 billion pounds, becoming a debtor nation. Therefore, the only way for it to seek to overcome this economic crisis is to extract wealth from its autonomous nations in the name of the British Empire. However, in the last year or two, the anti-British sentiment in the autonomous nations has been increasing, fundamentally shaking Britain. On June 2nd, the famous British economist Professor Fischer gave a speech to a group of industrialists at the Chatham Hotel, predicting the collapse of the British Empire and the reasons for its isolation, causing anxiety among the audience. The main points of his speech were roughly as follows: Those who expect something from the British Empire will suffer deep disillusionment and sorrow. The autonomous nations themselves do not have economic concepts that align with Britain's current interests for their future. The autonomous nations believe that establishing trade relations outside the Commonwealth is a necessary condition for their future economic prosperity. For example, Canada's ideal is to eliminate world trade barriers and engage in free trade. The Canadian economic community believes that close cooperation with the United States can obtain a large inflow of American goods. However, before this debt is repaid, not only can this exclusive British Empire group not be tolerated, but the attitude of the South African Federation towards the British Empire is also very indifferent. This is because its benefits of free trade with the world are far greater than those of Canada. Australian public opinion believes that the United States is the buyer of Australian meat, wheat, wool, etc., so the United States is a powerful force dominating the Australian economy. On the one hand, when Britain cannot realize its security guarantee organization, Australia may transform into a nation that is self-sufficient and extremely developed in industry. The situation in New Zealand is similar to that in Australia. As for India, it has a tendency towards isolationism.</p>

<p>Key to Solving Fundamental Problems</p>
<p>Central News Agency News – According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent on the 28th: As a result of the recent Moscow Conference, it was decided to establish a Polish unified government in Warsaw. Regarding this, two fundamental problems have arisen: One is to recognize Moscow's sincerity, and the other is to guarantee that free elections will be allowed in Poland. The attitude of the Polish regime in London towards this situation is noteworthy. According to the latest documents issued by the regime, it reveals considerable distrust of the Soviet Union's sincerity. Regarding so-called free elections, the regime's view is that free and fair elections are absolutely impossible as long as Soviet troops and political police are stationed in Polish territory and political life is not free. In short, the key figures in the new Polish government believe that the Soviet Union sincerely wishes to establish friendly relations with Poland. Conversely, the Polish regime in London holds the traditional Polish suspicion. Therefore, the key to solving the problem lies in whether the above two opposing attitudes can be reconciled.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Soviet Union Hopes to Conclude a Treaty of Friendship with Turkey <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 29th – According to Reuters military interviewer Kish: Regarding the issue of future management of the Dardanelles Strait, the matter will be brought up for discussion at the Three-Power Conference, which now seems to have been confirmed. As for the nature of the opinions exchanged between the Soviet Union and the Turkish government regarding the management of the Dardanelles Strait, there is currently no official information. However, it is generally believed that the exchange of opinions only involved the conflict in Syria and the urgent situation in the Levant. The Soviet government now hopes to re-sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the Turkish government. This will make the Dardanelles Strait Management Regulations stipulated in the former Montreux Conference a mere formality. The Soviet proposal is nothing more than to prohibit foreign warships from entering the Dardanelles Strait, and only the Soviet Union and Turkey can freely navigate in the strait. Therefore, the Soviet government has recently proposed to the Turkish government to establish a joint base to protect the Dardanelles Strait and the Aegean Sea. What is currently causing anxiety for the Turkish authorities is the Soviet Union's demand for greater democratization of the Turkish government.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 29th – A major conspiracy to use Arabs to collectively rebel in Algiers on July 1st was fortunately discovered in advance. Several masterminds have been arrested by French judicial officers, and many weapons and gunpowder have been seized. According to the steps of the conspiracy, the first step was to incite the Arabs to establish their provisional regime to fight against France, and then request a third country to mediate, forcing France to make concessions, which is exactly the same as the situation in the Levant. The initiator seems to be Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Seven Major Disputes in Europe <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Aftonbladet reports that after the Soviet army occupied Bornholm and Ertholmene (small Danish islands in the southern Baltic Sea off Sweden), it is bound to cause a seventh dispute in Europe in addition to the following six issues. The so-called six major problems in Europe are: the Polish issue; the Polish Kronkford and Oder River basin management issue; the Austrian pro-Soviet regime issue; the occupation of the Lithuanian coast; Tito's regime's demand for Trieste; Greece's demand for the return of Rhodes. Regarding this matter, the Daily Mail said: "The reason for these disputes lies in the attempt of various countries to establish their own sphere of influence and to include these regions within their own borders. Therefore, the above issues are unlikely to be resolved even in the peace conference. The only way to deal with this situation is to seek a legitimate solution with a calm and firm attitude. This is the policy adopted by Britain and the United States and has the right to require the Soviet Union to provide full support." This is a subtle warning to Britain and the Soviet Union. Another Manchester newspaper hinted that it would be best for the Soviet Union not to station troops in Bornholm for a long time. It said: "Bornholm is a strategically important island, and Denmark is a liberated country, not an occupied country. This point must be remembered. The British people hope that the Soviet army will withdraw from the island as soon as the military situation permits."</p>
<p>Aftonbladet reported a Copenhagen telegram that Soviet troops were constantly arriving in Bornholm, and it seemed that they intended to stay on the island for a long time. However, there are almost no remnants of the German army on Bornholm today. The Soviet army's job is only to collect the ammunition and weapons abandoned by the German army and send them to the rear. A Red Army major general, who is a member of the Soviet People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, arrived in Bornholm and negotiated with the local police. As a result, after 17:20 on the 15th, the island's telecommunications and telephone connections with the outside world were stopped. A postal plane that arrived on Bornholm Island at 11:00 on the 15th, which should have loaded local mail and flew away from the island in the afternoon, was also prevented. Regarding this matter, a statement of reasons was requested from the authorities, but it was not allowed. However, this incident did not occur because of any other unexpected changes, purely due to the intention of the local military authorities.</p>
<p>According to intelligence, there are 5,000 Soviet armored vehicle units and artillery on the island, and it is rumored that it will increase to 14,000 people. (Stockholm, 17th – Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Central Reserve Bank Increases the Amount of Cash for All Banks and Money Shops　Customers Should Be Paid in Cash as Much as Possible and No Detention Is Allowed <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>In recent ten days, the evil trend of discount on transfer orders in this city has become increasingly rampant, to the point of affecting the stability of the entire finance. The Central Reserve Bank is paying close attention to this. After the Financial Affairs Inspection Office checked the accounts of the financial institutions, not only were the actual discount evidences for transfer orders discovered, but also the practice of developing bad cheques discovered. Therefore, the authorities consider it imperative to fundamentally cancel the development of transfer orders. After convening the Silver and Money Industries Association to discuss the matter, it was decided that from July 3, all banks and money shops will stop developing transfer orders from the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Agricultural Money Reserve. For customer deposits and withdrawals, in addition to cash, parallel-lined checks will be used for payment.</p>
<p>Central Reserve Bank's Solution for Cash</p>
<p>As for the issue of cash needed by various banks and money shops after the cancellation of transfer orders, Qian Daji, Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, has agreed to the request of the responsible person of the Silver and Money Industries Association. All cash needed for the salaries of the staff of the Silver and Money Industries Association member banks and money shops and all expenses will be prepared by each bank and money shop, sent to the Central Reserve Bank for review, and then paid in special cash. For the cash to be paid to customers for withdrawals, the amount of cash will be increased according to the standard of the deposit amount of each bank and money shop. Each bank and money shop should pay customers in cash as much as possible every day, and should not accumulate cash, so as to avoid the accumulation under the pretext, and secretly breeding the evils of discount.</p>
<p>Central Reserve Bank's Circular on Canceling Transfer Orders</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank issued a circular to cancel the transfer orders of sixty exchange banks, stating: "The checks (that is, transfer orders) previously issued to various exchange banks by this bank have been stipulated by this bank to be canceled from July 3. All funds deposited in the clearing account of this bank will be paid with application forms for interbank transfers. As for your bank's customer deposits and withdrawals, in addition to cash, parallel-lined checks will be used for payment. The style of this check is attached, please print it yourself to ensure uniformity. This is hereby notified, please investigate and handle it."</p>

<p>Ping Bao, established in Shanghai for nearly five years, will announce its suspension of publication starting tomorrow (July 1st) to respond to wartime material conservation policies. The reporter considers this a major change in the city's press circles, worthy of attention. Therefore, a special visit was made to the person in charge of the newspaper to inquire about everything. They sincerely made the following statement: "Our newspaper was founded on September 1, 1940, and has been through four years and ten months. Although it has encountered many difficulties during this short period, the colleagues of this newspaper, under the guidance and encouragement of Chairman Zhou Fohai, Managing Director Jun Qiang Luo, President Xiong Bai Jin, and Deputy Director Guangjie Lu, have strived to overcome difficulties and worked hard for the war and national policy. However, due to limited ability, little has been achieved, failing the heavy trust of the authorities and the expectations of society. Now, our Chairman Zhou, in view of the shortage of wartime materials, which urgently requires strict conservation, and the abundance of Chinese newspapers in this city, up to seven, each exerting its capabilities and possessing its readers, feels that manpower is dispersed and material resources are wasted. After several considerations, he resolutely decided to take the lead in suspending our newspaper to advocate for conservation. Chairman Zhou is responsible for the central government and also in charge of Shanghai's administration. To smoothly promote government decisions, he does not hesitate to sacrifice his own hard-earned business. His painstaking efforts should be admired by all parties. And although the colleagues of this newspaper have always regarded the newspaper business as a lifelong career, to implement national policy, they should gladly accept the order and take a temporary break, which is also hoped to be understood by people from all walks of life. When materials are sufficient in the future and the country needs the colleagues to teach and command, our newspaper can resume publication at any time, and the colleagues will definitely continue to struggle and implement the original intention."</p>

<p>Jin Xiongbo, President of Ping Bao, is a leader in the press circles and has made many contributions to the press in recent years while presiding over Ping Bao. His contribution to the communication and promotion of unity among press colleagues is particularly great.

President Chen of this newspaper, considering that Jin has rich professional experience in the press and has made many contributions in the past, specially invited Jin to be a consultant for this newspaper, regularly coming to the office to guide everything, so as to learn from him.</p>

<p>The press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:30 AM yesterday. Director Dai Yingfu of the Municipal Bureau of Education attended and answered the questions raised by various press agencies in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Tuition Standards</p>
<p>(Question) Has the tuition standard for the next semester and private schools been stipulated as the summer vacation is approaching? If any schools do not comply with the stipulated standards, how do you plan to deal with it?</p>
<p>(Answer) The tuition standard for the first semester of the next academic year has been drafted. Based on the economic status of the students' families in each school, the amount of tuition and the percentage of free student places have been determined. The highest amount for high school is 20,000 yuan, and the lowest is 12,000 yuan. The highest amount for junior high school is 16,000 yuan, and the lowest is 10,000 yuan. The highest amount for senior elementary school is 12,000 yuan, and the lowest is 4,000 yuan. The highest amount for lower elementary school is 8,000 yuan, and the lowest is 3,000 yuan. The economic responsibility of private primary and secondary schools should be the responsibility of the board of directors. Therefore, the collection of tuition fees is tentatively approved by the principal to consult with the board of directors, determine the amount based on the economic conditions of the majority of students' families, draft a payment method in installments, and stipulate the number of free places, and report to the bureau for record. Violation of the ministry's order, collecting rice or converting it into money, will be reported to the municipal government for punishment. The above detailed methods are being submitted to the government for approval and will be announced and implemented upon approval.</p>
<p>Lane Schools</p>
<p>(Question) There are many private schools, the so-called lane schools, in Shanghai, and the internal facilities are simple. It not only misleads children but also hinders the development of the entire education system. Has the Bureau of Education considered banning them?</p>
<p>(Answer) The number of private schools in Shanghai is unprecedented in major cities around the world. After the incident, they sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, and no one cared about them. The internal facilities are simple, but in this autumn of ten thousand times the price of goods, the difficulties of the school authorities are understandable. In my opinion, there are many children out of school. As long as the teachers are qualified and can run the school seriously, even if the equipment is slightly simpler, it is not necessary to be too demanding at this time. However, those who run corruptly should be banned.</p>
<p>Teacher Qualifications</p>
<p>Many schools, especially private schools, neglect the issue of teacher qualifications, and there are even elementary school students who have not graduated and are already serving as elementary school teachers. Does the Bureau of Education have any rectification measures?</p>
<p>(Answer) The issue of teacher qualifications is a serious problem in education after the incident. Excellent teachers have left schools due to the threat to their lives. At the beginning of my arrival in the deserted capital, I pointed out this seriousness and called for efforts to bring excellent teachers back to the affiliated schools. The bureau stipulates pay based on qualifications, and the government strives to improve teachers' treatment, which contains this profound meaning. There are graduates from university education colleges in this semester who came to municipal elementary schools to teach, and there are those who have served as heads of education for many years and are willing to serve as middle school principals. It must be said that excellent teachers have gradually returned to the schools. The situation in private schools is also different from school to school. There are many schools with a shortage of teachers. The bureau has formulated regulations on the appointment and dismissal of primary and secondary school teachers. There are regulations on the qualifications for the employment of primary and secondary school teachers, which will be gradually rectified in accordance with these regulations. These regulations will be announced and implemented once approved by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Change of School System</p>
<p>(Question) The three-semester system has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Education, but in general, schools are already implementing it privately. For example, St. John's University has already started school. I wonder how the Director of Education will deal with this?</p>
<p>(Answer) The two-semester system is stipulated by the Ministry of Education. Changing to three semesters concerns the entire national school system. The power lies with the state. The bureau received a report in May that some universities were considering changing to three semesters. Fearing that it would affect the overall situation, it immediately reported to the Ministry of Education. Minister Li was very angry about this and ordered Shanghai private colleges and universities not to change to three semesters without authorization. If what you said is true, the Ministry of Education will definitely ban it.</p>

<p>Zhou Lü from the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Department wrote a letter saying: "Dear Sirs, Because there is a shortage of ten-yuan notes in the city, the small decimals at the time of salary payment cannot be issued according to the salary slip, so those who are less than 100 yuan are deducted. Now, I have collected 2,100 yuan in national currency, which I respectfully offer to be used as a "charity school fund".

<h3 id="e52">The Special Attack Force Base Under the Green Canopy <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Before and after the brave parachute troops forcefully landed in enemy territory, special attack forces departing from a certain base successively crashed into enemy fleets, establishing tremendous military achievements. This time, the reporter made a special trip to observe the situation at that base.</p>
<p>That day, amid air raid sirens, we arrived at our destination. After a long spell of rain, the weather was very clear, and the entire base, like a fully inflated ball, was full of resilience. Utilizing the deep green trees and complex terrain, the headquarters of the unit and the crisscrossing passageways of the airfield were well concealed, making it extremely difficult for Grumman or B-29 type aircraft to detect. Moreover, the air defense equipment was perfect, putting people's minds at ease. That morning, the aviation unit here was ordered to provide cover for the special attack forces departing from other bases. When I arrived there, it was just about to take off.</p>
<p>"Damn it, today we're going to beat those Grummans to a pulp!" Soldiers in full flight gear, gripping their military swords, strode towards their aircraft.</p>
<p>At this moment, several formations of Grumman aircraft suddenly appeared in the distant sky, looking no bigger than sesame seeds. They circled the airfield once, seemingly discovering the aircraft that were taking off, and began to descend. Amid shouts of "Enemy planes!" "Enemy planes!", many mechanics, in order to protect the aircraft that had not yet taken off, refused to take shelter in the air raid shelters.</p>
<p>Banking sharply, diving steeply. In an instant, the enemy aircraft began to strafe the ground. In addition to machine guns, there seemed to be rockets as well. After several minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy aircraft, which had come to attack and restrain the battle of Okinawa, were finally scattered by anti-aircraft fire and fled in disarray. Only one of the planes that were about to depart was damaged, and the rest were completely unscathed. Then, according to the scheduled time, they took off from the airfield one after another and departed to attack the enemy.</p>
<p>"Haha, we're going to war!" For several days, because of the bad weather, the team members had long felt as if they were growing fat from being unable to go and kill the enemy. Being able to depart smoothly at this time made everyone overjoyed. In the earth-shaking roar, they bid farewell to the base.</p>
<p>A Burning Fighting Spirit</p>
<p>At this base, from the unit commander down to the privates, the lunch they ate was the same: barley rice and salted shredded radish. Although it was in the Japanese mainland, morning and evening, the field troops only ate dried or pickled vegetables.</p>
<p>"Two or three days ago, we ate cabbage, raw, and it tasted really good!" said a certain officer at headquarters.</p>
<p>Although life was so austere, the boldness of their spirit and the firmness of their fighting will were absolutely not affected in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Even if we have fewer aircraft than the enemy, we will never flinch!" said a certain lieutenant.</p>
<p>"No matter what, we've already given it to him! Damn it, let's turn Saipan upside down." Seeing the news of the enemy's carpet bombing, a soldier from Kanto said angrily.</p>
<p>This kind of vengeful psychology was extremely strong, from non-commissioned officers to field officers, and it can truly be said that their "spirit was soaring to the sky." This burning fighting spirit was the only guiding principle in their lives and dominated all their time.</p>
<p>Across the way, there were ordinary people's homes. Who would have thought that there would be two worlds so close together!</p>
<p>A State of Mind Where Man and Machine are One</p>
<p>"It would be great if everyone had the latest aircraft!" This was the hope of a certain unit commander.</p>
<p>This morning, a wireless telegram had come from the fleet of aircraft that had departed, saying that they were about to return. The unit commander felt very satisfied and immediately went to the airfield. Before long, returning friendly aircraft appeared from the continuous mountain peaks in the distance, one after another. Before long, they disbanded their formations and landed on the airfield one after another.</p>
<p>"I was really worried just now that they wouldn't be able to land safely. At first, when they departed, I couldn't rest easy. Although I waved my hat to send them off, I secretly held my breath until I saw the wheels leave the ground and the plane float in the air, and I finally breathed a sigh of relief," said a certain commander at the airfield. He regarded the precious aircraft as part of his own body.</p>
<p>A Unit Teeming with Talent</p>
<p>The unit here produced a plethora of talent, including Lieutenant Takashi Kurimura and Sergeant Isamu Sakamoto, who had crashed B-29s over Tokyo, one of whom received the Emperor's commendation and the other of whom received the Medal of Military Merit. In addition to these two distinguished people, there were also warriors who had shot down eighteen Grumman aircraft and destroyed six when enemy aircraft launched a large-scale air raid on Kanto.</p>
<p>"I don't think there could be a worse day than today." The returning warrior sighed.</p>
<p>Returning safely and still saying that his luck was bad really confused people. After going to investigate carefully, it turned out that it was because they had not encountered any opponents today.</p>
<p>"We were responsible for providing cover, and we returned safely. Except for two planes that had problems and were forced to land, the rest all returned without incident. The weather was good from the archipelago line to the Okinawa area, and the special attack force's attack was completely successful." This was their report upon returning. Although no battle took place en route, the important mission of protecting the special attack force was completely carried out.</p>
<p>"Don't crash recklessly," the captain earnestly warned his subordinates. (Special Correspondent Aji) (Translated from the June 29th edition of the Continental New Report)</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Decisive Battle on the Mainland and the National Volunteer Corps <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>To prepare for the decisive battle on the mainland, the organization of the Japanese National Volunteer Corps has been largely completed throughout the country. Now that the ground battle on Okinawa Island has ended, the time for the decisive battle on the mainland is becoming increasingly urgent. And the National Volunteer Corps' national decisive battle organization is also burning with fighting spirit, and is beginning to take vigorous action towards its pure goal. The following is a record of questions and answers with a certain lieutenant colonel of the Army Ministry, from which the pure posture of the Japanese National Volunteer Corps can be seen.</p>
<p>Question: In order to carry out the decisive battle on the mainland, it is essential to first firmly establish an awareness of the decisive battle on the mainland. As long as there is a thorough awareness, one can enthusiastically engage in various preparations for the decisive battle. However, there are many optimistic observations in the civilian population, believing that the enemy may not land on the mainland. Under such circumstances, no matter how loudly you shout to the people that the decisive battle on the mainland is coming soon, it will be difficult to make them seriously prepare.</p>
<p>Answer: Whether the enemy will attack the mainland, of course, must be proven by future facts. However, from the strategic perspective of both sides, the inevitability of the decisive battle on the mainland can now be clearly understood, and this is the reason why we believe that the decisive battle on the mainland will inevitably occur. From the enemy's point of view, a landing operation directly attacking the mainland, which can determine the final result of the war, is the most important point of attack. Since the start of the Pacific counteroffensive, the decisive battle on the mainland is truly the finishing touch. For example, in baseball, the enemy, who has paid a great price in blood in places like Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and has scored some points, will be like automatically forfeiting the game in the end if they do not carry out an attack on the mainland. No matter how many points they score, they cannot be considered the winners.</p>
<p>There are currently nine hundred B-29 type aircraft in the Mariana Islands area, and the Okinawa base and Iwo Jima base are expected to expand rapidly in the future, and the strategic and tactical bombing of the enemy's base air force will be more thorough. Raids by thousands of enemy aircraft are expected to occur soon. However, raids cannot determine the final outcome of the war. In order to fight to the last round and strive for victory, the enemy must land on our mainland with boats or airborne troops. In the future, the enemy will make the bombing of the mainland thorough, and at the same time may carry out continental coastal operations, or land on the Korean coast, but the cumulative increase in the number of local decisive battles is intended only to facilitate the final battle, so the mainland must be the final battlefield, and the decisive battle on the mainland must be the last round.</p>
<p>However, due to the end of the European war, the enemy is eager for the war to end as soon as possible, and the increasing enemy losses are also making the enemy reluctant to make further local offensives, and instead directly attack the mainland in an attempt to launch a final decisive battle. This possibility is now quite large. We also have a fully adequate decisive battle strategy for the enemy's decisive battle strategy on the mainland. We truly have the advantages of terrain and popular support, and can concentrate all our forces to deal with the invading enemy, and no longer have the difficulties of isolated island warfare, and can meet the enemy in continental operations. Therefore, while the decisive battle on the mainland is desired by the enemy, it is also what we hope for. In past battles, the enemy has often been in an active position, but in the decisive battle on the mainland, they will reverse the old state of affairs and be initiated by us, trapping the enemy in a passive position. In other words, it is not a case of them attacking and us defending, but a bloodbath of attack against attack. If we do not have such a spirit, then our expectations for the decisive battle on the mainland are still not sufficient.</p>
<p>Question: The decisive battle on the mainland is a battle that is shared with the nation's destiny and territory. Due to the advantages of terrain and popular support, there are certainly many benefits of continental operations that can be obtained, and all the people of the country will rise up to defend the territory, but we should not close our eyes to the difficulties and disadvantages. We must point them out to make the people deeply understand them, so that the people can have a correct attitude towards the battle for the territory. Is that right?</p>
<p>Answer: In the isolated island operations up to now, we have only fought with a fixed number of troops. Although the enemy has been constantly increasing reinforcements, our garrison troops are always limited. This is because the enemy's mobile forces have an absolute advantage, so they can maintain their huge logistical arteries. However, the situation will be different in the decisive battle on the mainland. Our combat power, which was in an isolated state on the islands, can now ensure a deep defensive capability. The foundation of this deep defensive capability is, needless to say, the 100 million people and the territory. The enemy will of course extend the supply line to our mainland and try to counterattack our deep defensive capability. The decisive battle on the mainland is a battle against the long supply line maintained by enemy ships and aircraft. From the perspective of this logistical warfare, the decisive battle on the mainland is clearly advantageous to us. However, at that time, the army and the general public will fight side by side, so in the mainland battlefield where the front lines and the rear are intertwined and mixed, if the command, organization, and use of the people fighting alongside the army are disorganized, there is a danger that the army will be drawn into the chaotic vortex of the people. This is the disadvantage of the mainland becoming a battlefield.</p>
<p>Suppose the mainland has a million troops, but can only produce a million units of combat power, then it will be no different from isolated island warfare. To have a million troops with the combat power equivalent to three million or five million troops, this is the ideal decisive battle on the mainland. The establishment of the National Volunteer Corps and its future significance as a combat unit lies here. To command the people on the battlefield, to do their duty to the fullest, without losing wartime order in the slightest, so that the elite army can fight under the best conditions, this is the original mission of the National Volunteer Corps. We already have a well-trained and elite army, and we hope that the National Volunteer Corps will be the backing of this army, forming a deep defensive capability, so that the forward generals and soldiers can have no worries and concentrate on killing the enemy.</p>
<p>Question: The true mission of the National Volunteer Corps is to complete logistical tasks, which is very important. However, this point does not seem to be fully understood by the local end-level portions. The impression given by the end-level organization is that its mission is to lightly take up weapons and engage in combat, for example, farmers put down their hoes and are enthusiastic about bamboo spear training.</p>
<p>Answer: There are indeed such people. It must be that they are confused by the names of the Volunteer Corps and the Combat Unit. When you mention the Combat Unit, you think of grabbing a gun and going to the front line to kill the enemy. This is a misunderstanding and a lack of understanding of the true slander of modern total war. In total war, the entire people and the entire nation are combatants. Moreover, what determines the success or failure of modern war is not the front line, but how well the logistical preparations in the rear are. At the time of the decisive battle on the mainland, today's production limit determines tomorrow's war preparations. Because the situation is like this, the advancement of decisive battle preparations is all about the rise in production, and it can be said that the key to this is the members of the National Volunteer Corps. Production is combat, and during the decisive battle on the mainland, the relationship between the two is particularly close. Industrial soldiers in factories fighting in factories is combat; farmers working hard in the fields with their hoes is also combat; the people of the country are working hard in their respective positions, enthusiastically increasing production, which is the national attitude required by the country during the decisive battle on the mainland. Except for places that directly turn into battlefields, the above-mentioned principles will remain unchanged even when the National Volunteer Corps is converted into a combat unit. If a combat order has been issued, and the people each take up bamboo spears as weapons and act in a chaotic manner, the war will fail.</p>
<p>If the farmers drop their hoes and take up guns, then who will farm? If industrial soldiers put down their hammers and engage in combat training, then who will be responsible for producing tomorrow's munitions? Whether it is bamboo spear training or combat training, its true meaning lies only in cultivating the spirit of struggle. (Translated from the June 27th edition of the Continental New Report)</p>

<p>The enemy forces attempted to land in the vicinity of Balikpapan, but the Japanese garrison and local volunteers fought bravely, causing the enemy to lose many ships and unable to advance.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy forces on Okinawa Island, the enemy has recently rushed to build ten airfields in the southern part of the island, and the enemy's intentions to strengthen the base are becoming more apparent. The Japanese Air Force also discovered enemy fleet activity in the waters near the Kerama Islands. On the 26th of this month, the enemy forcibly landed on Kume Island, ninety kilometers west of Okinawa Island. After being dealt a head-on blow by the Japanese Air Force's special attack force and the navy, the enemy forces on Kume Island, the airfields on Okinawa Island, and the enemy fleet suffered heavy damage. Therefore, the enemy's activities during the Okinawa campaign have been greatly constrained.</p>

<h3 id="e55">A Plea for Water <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Ting Qiu</p>
<p>"The seven necessities for opening the door," you can't do without it except for immortals. But in this era of skyrocketing living standards, how many families are not anxious about life? Who doesn't exhaust their minds and painstakingly seek to support a household?</p>
<p>The high prices can no longer keep people warm. And the endless disputes over tap water in recent months have given citizens new stimulation and threats.</p>
<p>An investigation found that there are no rivers or swamps within the urban area of this city. Daily water consumption depends entirely on the supply of tap water. Recently, the water and electricity company has adjusted its prices again, increasing them by two times compared to before. In addition, the fines for exceeding the limit have also been increased at the same time. This matter has too great an impact on the lives of citizens.</p>
<p>Water has a great relationship with human life. Limiting electricity is certainly a step that should be taken under the wartime system, but there are other substitutes that can be used. However, the restriction and punishment of "water" need to be relaxed and changed. Because there are no substitutes available, and there is no black market supply.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been quite a few people who have been fined for exceeding the water limit. The amount of the fine is as high as three to five million. Such a huge amount really gives people the feeling that "selling everything" is not enough to pay. Therefore, some areas have suffered the disaster of water cuts! Just imagine what the daily lives of those who suffer are like?</p>
<p>Most of those who are fined are large buildings, public places, and some alleys. The reason for the fine is that 19 out of 20 times, one total water meter is used as a public utility for several households. In the past, consumption was included in the rent and paid by the landlord. Only after consumption became expensive did it become the responsibility of the tenants themselves. In fact, the tenants do not know how much water they use each month, or how much the limit is. Therefore, unscrupulous agents arbitrarily add some handling fees, and the list of exploitations is endless. If the amount is small, the tenants have to pay it in pain in order to seek peace. If the amount is large, they really cannot afford it, so it causes many difficult to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>As far as the author knows, a certain place on Shanxi Road was fined more than 2 million last month. Because they were unable to pay for a while, they were cut off from water. It took half a month to raise the money and pay it off. But the water valve had not yet been opened, and it was said that a fine that was more than double the amount was coming next. Like this, aren't the citizens only obligated to pay fines, and have lost the right to use water? Such a huge amount of consumption is simply going to exceed other living expenses.</p>
<p>The reason given by the company authorities for fining users is because they exceeded the limit. Then, in order to avoid being fined, we should, on the one hand, adhere to the limit and save on daily consumption, and on the other hand, find a proper solution.</p>
<p>If there is only one total water meter for ordinary alley residents, they can each install a separate water meter (each costing about 50,000 to 60,000), and elect a manager among the residents to distribute the company's limit equally. In the future, if any household exceeds the limit, then the fine will be borne by the household that exceeds the limit. In this way, those who waste water can be alerted, and those who save water on a regular basis can avoid unjust fines, and all disputes can be easily resolved!</p>
<p>At the same time, I also thought of ordinary boiled water shops (commonly known as tiger stoves), which sell at a limited price of 20 yuan per ladle under the high consumption, coal prices, and expenses. Their water consumption is of course many times more than that of ordinary households. Don't we see that some boiled water shops have already stopped operating? An investigation of the reasons for their closure found that 19 out of 20 times, it was nothing more than fines for consumption. Therefore, all those who are barely operating have to raise prices in an attempt to make up for it. In this way, doesn't the tap water company indirectly create a black market for water?</p>
<p>We have to appeal to the主管機關 (competent authorities). For the sake of protecting the lives of citizens and removing the threat of "water"! At the same time, we earnestly request the current 관리부국 (management bureau) to consider the common interests of the Chinese and Japanese people today, relax the water limit, and reduce fines.</p>
<h3 id="e56">On the Remittance Order <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Ku Kou</p>
<p>The circulation of remittance orders in the market was, at the time, a temporary relief method. The so-called relief was because the current currency was not sufficient for payment, and there was no other way to do it. Unexpectedly, a good cause led to a bad result. In theory, this phenomenon should not have occurred. Let me explain in detail:</p>
<p>As the name implies, a remittance order represents immediate remittance and transfer, and there is no reason to keep it without transferring it and use it as currency for circulation.</p>
<p>For every remittance order opened, there must of course be funds deposited in the Central Reserve Bank of China or the Bank Reserve Association and the Money Industry Reserve to prepare before opening it. There should never be remittance orders opened without deposits.</p>
<p>Remittance orders are for relieving the shortage of currency and meeting deposit requirements. They should not be regarded as issuing a remittance order, which is equivalent to granting the right to circulate.</p>
<p>The above three points are extremely common and should be known to all, without the need for detailed explanation. However, in fact, none of them go against the grain, resulting in today's adverse consequences of remittance orders, which is very strange. What caused this? In a word, the main reason is that the current currency is in greater demand than supply. All kinds of illegal acts by people in pursuit of exorbitant profits, seeking profits regardless of everything, so that extremely good methods get extremely bad results, which is also one of the important reasons. What is past is past, and what is to come can be pursued. Following the remittance order, each bank and firm will use parallel line checks to pay for deposits and withdrawals, which will be implemented soon. The issuing banks and firms should handle the matter with caution, because a little carelessness will be extremely harmful to society. Here are my humble opinions, which are divided into the following sections, for the reference of people in society and financial workers.</p>
<p>Parallel line checks are still a type of transfer instrument and should be transferred immediately and not regarded as a type of current currency.</p>
<p>The issuing banks and firms of parallel line checks should bear full responsibility and should not issue them arbitrarily.</p>
<p>The holder of the check must pay attention to the credit of the issuing bank and firm. If you do not pay attention and regard it as the same as currency, and suffer damage, it will be too late to regret it. The method of paying attention can be illustrated by an example. For example, A should receive 1 million from B. B pays with a parallel line check from C's bank and firm. A should focus on whether he can trust C's bank and firm. If he cannot trust it, he can refuse to accept it. This is the freedom of the right holder, and the debtor cannot object.</p>
<p>When parallel line checks are issued, the details of the issuance process should be recorded in detail for verification. If it is found that a bank or firm is using this check for illegal activities, it should be ordered to immediately suspend business and severely punished. Each bank and firm should fill in the outstanding balance that has not been transferred and report it to the Silver and Money Industry Association for verification.</p>
<p>Parallel line checks are a temporary measure to relieve the shortage of currency supply. The Central Reserve Bank of China, which issues currency, should quickly seek fundamental improvement methods, increase the issue of banknotes, nourish the issuance of this check, or even stop it.</p>
<p>Since the issuance of remittance orders has been stopped, those that have been issued should be quickly transferred, recovered, and canceled. The Silver and Money Industry Association should officially announce a deadline for completion and clearing, and order each bank and firm to prepare a balance statement at the end of the deadline and deposit the balance separately.</p>
<p>To sum up, the bottom line is that the method is determined by people. After replacing the remittance order with this instrument, whether the problem of currency shortage can be solved smoothly depends entirely on people.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Founding Obligatory Vocational Schools <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Jiwen</p>
<p>After reading "Establishing Compulsory Secondary and Higher Education" in the 14th issue of this publication, I also have some opinions below.</p>
<p>Establishing compulsory higher education is certainly a very necessary thing, but establishing obligatory vocational schools is also an urgent matter at present. Because many young people in employment have taken up their jobs due to poverty, they are very eager to study and improve themselves. To address their educational needs, the most convenient approach is to start from their own circumstances and environment.</p>
<p>Most industrial and commercial capitalists adopt an attitude of "the less trouble, the better," but wise capitalists will surely know that if they establish obligatory vocational schools to educate their employees, it will not only not be a loss to them, but on the contrary, it will be to their benefit. Those who complain about meager pay will now receive spiritual benefits; after a period of training, their standards will all improve; if the educational level of employees is raised, won't the efficiency of their service also increase? If employees feel grateful for the opportunity and are therefore wholeheartedly loyal, wouldn't that be a great gain for the capitalists? On the other hand, the employees will also receive great benefits.</p>
<p>However, this matter still requires the guidance and leadership of the education authorities; on the one hand, they should persuade the industrial and commercial sectors about the meaning and purpose of this, and further explain the advantages and disadvantages, so that even the stubborn will earnestly be willing to do it. Then, they should think of ways to make a concrete and systematic plan, forming units like guilds in various industries and setting up an obligatory school for each unit. After the small units in each unit acknowledge the expenses they should contribute, the matter can immediately be actively carried out.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they should conduct a registration of those who need to receive higher education. Although many employees have been influenced by society and do not think about studying and progressing, a considerable portion of us are limited by circumstances and eagerly hope to seek further education. If the obligatory vocational schools are run for some time, those industrial and commercial employees who have been isolated from books may also be influenced by their surroundings and think about participating in reading, transformed by the atmosphere of everyone.</p>
<p>Regarding classrooms, teachers, curriculum, teaching materials, and other issues, it naturally remains for the education authorities to allocate and provide guidance, whether through borrowing or hiring part-time staff. Generally, there should be no difficulties. For class division, it is best to divide them into several levels according to the level of proficiency. Because the main subjects are electives and require special knowledge of various industries, the obligatory schools of various industries cannot be combined for classes. However, there is much basic common knowledge among various industries that can be taught together to save costs in all aspects. Regarding these things, it can be determined based on the situation at the time, and initially, there is no need to limit it to certain rules.</p>
<p>In short: If obligatory vocational schools can be managed in an orderly manner, and all parties can enthusiastically and vigorously carry them out, it won't be long before the results are certainly impressive. The speech and attitude of industrial and commercial employees will definitely improve or change unexpectedly, and at least, the spiritual aspect will be enriched significantly.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Abolish Discounting <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Longying</p>
<p>The discounting of "allocation slips" has the greatest impact on ordinary people. A friend who is a middle school teacher works hard for a month and gets an allocation slip for 100,000 yuan. He first converts it into smaller denominations, and then converts it into cash. With the cash, he can only buy one dou and one sheng of rice. At the same time, a low-level employee of a certain bank can get 200,000 yuan in cash every day, and by discounting it at "two jiao," he can net 40,000 yuan. In addition, senior employees, using their job convenience, indirectly discount the cash, which has also become an open secret. Therefore, the crying ones cry, and the laughing ones laugh, only to invisibly raise prices by 20,000.</p>
<p>After the circulation of allocation slips is stopped from July 3rd, the problem of cash shortage in the market will not be solved as a result. If each bank and firm is allowed to issue "bank drafts" on its own, it is still the same old wine in a new bottle. If bank drafts cannot be discounted at all, then the common people will suffer. If discounting is allowed to run rampant, it is equivalent to the former "drawing head," and the discount rate will rise endlessly. How will the common people live in the future?</p>
<p>As a commoner, I have shallow knowledge of the national monetary policy and should not make reckless comments, but I always feel that there is room for discussion on the method of tightening cash. Therefore, from now on, I think the first priority should be to check the cash inflow and outflow of the banks themselves; second, the 10,000 yuan should be considered for issuance; third, the circulation of "allocation slips" and "bank drafts" can be completely cancelled, so that "discounting" cannot occur; fourth, the capital in this port should be used for legitimate productive purposes; fifth, the cash in other ports and rural areas should also be retrieved.</p>
<p>At this time and in this place, to achieve the above points, the cooperation of friendly countries is also needed. It is necessary to know that the importance of the cash problem is no less than the rice problem.</p>

<h3 id="e59">The Comet That Never Shined <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiong</p>
<p>This time, carrying a bit of light creation, I returned to my hometown, N City, which I had been away from for ten years. I stayed in the hospital for more than a month. After being discharged, my mother specially rented two houses for me in the nearby countryside, wanting me to rest there. Partly because I couldn't bear to disappoint my mother too much, and partly because I had a bit of nostalgia for my hometown, which I had originally disliked, I finally stayed temporarily. However, for someone like me who has always been busy, rest is almost a punishment. I always like to take long walks, hoping to encounter some new things by chance; I have also visited the homes of many friends from the past, but I can hardly meet an old acquaintance. I felt lonely, and I missed them even more. I waited every day with a hopeful heart for a new and unexpected encounter.</p>
<p>Finally, one morning, I was idly walking on a road leading to the city, when a thin woman walked past me. Her overly thin body had a sickly appearance at first glance, but this back view and walking posture were so familiar! Because I was walking aimlessly, she was already two or three zhang ahead of me. I slightly increased my pace to catch up, and the sound of my footsteps startled her. She turned her head and revealed a surprised expression: "Eh! Jiong, is that you?" After a slight recognition, I found a unique red mole on her thin left cheek. "Ah! Yingzi, is that you!" I really couldn't say I recognized her. If it weren't for that clear mark. She had changed so much. Who could believe that the woman whose vitality had been taken away by more than half was the same lively and healthy Yingzi from before? The one who once stirred up my ardent love, although I only tasted a bit of unrequited love, I had always been missing her and blessing her! Standing in front of her, my heart was filled with a complex emotion that was difficult to name: embarrassment, sorrow, regret... With trembling hands, I grasped her bony hand, and I felt her trembling as well. I remembered that this hand used to be strong, and when I held it, she would often try to pull it away forcefully, but today she let it lie limply in my hand. I saw that her eyes were wet.</p>
<p>"Jiong! Do you still recognize me? It's been ten years!"</p>
<p>"How could I forget you? But you are too different from before. How did you become so thin?" I saw that the flesh on her cheeks had completely disappeared, and a pair of large eyes were sunken in, dull, looking at people as if they had lost their brilliance.</p>
<p>"I don't know either," she seemed unwilling to say more. "It's getting late now. Can I come to your house to see you this afternoon?" I saw the stack of books under her armpit, and I knew that she must be teaching. I couldn't bear to ask her about the past. I thought her heart must be filled with heavy sorrow, so I told her my address, and she left in a hurry. I looked at her thin back, and I felt sad for her loss of vitality. I remembered that when we were together before, she was still a high school student, and I was still studying at C University. Because I and a few friends had organized an extracurricular reading club, she also joined through the introduction of a friend. When she first came, she was completely a good girl from a traditional family, gentle and refined, silent and寡言. Apart from reading, she knew nothing else, yet her body was plump and healthy. Later, she gradually learned a lot of knowledge. In less than a year, she completely changed her appearance. She had a very strong ability to distinguish, understand, and remember. Coupled with her efforts, her social knowledge progressed exceptionally. She was very good at speaking, able to speak eloquently in public, able to criticize bravely, and able to write essays that flowed smoothly. She had a cheerful and bright personality, and she was quick and thorough in her work. Every friend thought she was a very promising child, and she also had a sweet and pleasing face. The friends in the club had very good friendships with her. I dare not believe that I had any outstanding qualities, but because my place of residence was close to hers, the opportunities for us to discuss and talk were relatively more. Therefore, our feelings were also more harmonious. Although she was five or six years younger than me, I could certainly give her some guidance at first, but soon she not only understood my thoughts, but sometimes would give me encouragement and warnings. Indeed, she was so smart. In fact, she was only a fifteen or sixteen year old child at that time, but she already understood everything. Talking with her always made people feel happy and refreshed. Although she did not like to dress up, the natural girlish vitality she showed made people feel the purest true beauty.</p>
<p>Later, our club also opened a public night school, and she took on the main work of the women's department. Every night, we would return in the dark. Sometimes we were immersed in the bright moonlight, talking and walking, and our hearts were very close. Of course, in this situation, everyone would forgive me for having a love for her, right? She was such a lovable girl! I believed that we would definitely be able to get mutual help in our careers in the future. It's just that I have a cousin, who can be considered my fiancée. Because she had no parents, she had always been in my house. Therefore, when I asked her for her love, she refused to accept it. She said, "Jiong, please don't mention these annoying things! Our feelings were originally very good. If you must talk about these things, I will become estranged from you." What was I supposed to do? Before, when I had not told her that I loved her, when we walked in the moonless night, she would naturally lean against me, and I would hold her hand tightly, and she would also hold mine very tightly; but later, when I held her, she would always pull it away from my hand. I couldn't believe that she didn't love me. I asked her directly, and she said, "I love you like I love my own brother, can't I?" I told her that my cousin didn't know how to read a few words, and I had never loved her. It would be easy to break off the engagement. But when I talked to her about these things, she would stay far away from me. I asked her why, and she said, "Aren't we happy being friends like this? In the future, when you get married, we can still work together in our careers, and everyone will be happy. If you hurt a poor girl, everyone will be troubled instead. I absolutely don't want you to be so willful. Besides, I am already very satisfied with our current friendship and don't need further love." What else could I say to her? Maybe she was still just a child, thinking about things so simply, or it could be said that she was too 민事 (civilized/reasonable), thinking so thoughtfully. She could understand me from any point of view or occasion, but on this point, she seemed to intentionally not understand me. I knew that although she looked strong in character, she had a compassionate heart. She simply never treated anyone harshly. She could forgive all unfortunate people. She loved her family, loved her friends, loved humanity, and she protected her female compatriots even more. Precisely because her heart was too gentle, it was also her weakness. She would often let emotions exceed reason, softened by her mother's tears. I often said that she still lacked courage, but she did not show pity for my heart that ardently loved her. What a strange girl! Only on the eve of my departure, she was still unable to return because of family ties. She shed tears for me. Taking this opportunity, I boldly kissed her. She did not refuse me as I had expected. I asked her, and she said, "Since we are about to part, why should I be stingy with this little bit and make you uncomfortable? I have never hated you!" What memorable words!</p>
<p>After that, the mist separated our news, but I have never stopped remembering and blessing her. I have always believed that she is a new woman who can exert some power for mankind.</p>
<p>This afternoon after our meeting, she found my house. Seeing her weak body, I was filled with grief. I really didn't dare to ask her anything anymore; she told me on her own initiative: her sickly father had died eight years ago, leaving behind her mother and two younger siblings. She had no choice but to abandon her plan to go to work in a distant place and take on the burden of the family. So she taught, and at the same time, she was unwilling to give up social activities, so she had to busy herself with public night schools and various affairs. Later, the cost of living rose day by day. She had to work non-stop every day, and she still couldn't feed her family. The surrounding environment became more and more harsh, and her resentment became more and more intense. She had a boiling passion, she had a fighting spirit, but she also passionately loved her mother and younger siblings, and she could not resolutely do the social work she wanted to do. She still struggled under the burden of the family, and coupled with the hardships of life, she finally became ill, suffering from lung disease. She still needed to work non-stop, and her love and hate became even more turbulent. She became more active in social causes, but her illness gradually worsened. It's a pity that even though she had a firm and courageous spirit and a heart full of energy, she still couldn't defeat the invasion of the disease. Now she is a patient with advanced lung disease. When she speaks to me, she often has to clench her teeth, and sometimes she will clench her fists. I know that her heart is extremely painful. I have great regret for her. Everyone had great hopes for her, a new youth general, how could she be extinguished so easily? I sympathize with her, pity her, respect her, and love her. I am too excited. I wish I could use my enthusiasm to help her. I want to kiss her, but she pushes me away forcefully and says, "I am already finished. We are already on different paths. You still have many things to do. You should create. Do you also want to destroy yourself?" I stare at her blankly. Is she really finished? My heart feels like it is pressed under a weight. It is her shadow, gradually sinking, sinking. I know that this comet will not shine!</p>
<h3 id="e60">An Extraordinary Encounter <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiyao</p>
<p>One day, near noon, I came out of school and strolled along Jing'an Temple Road. I saw some silk stockings in a shop window that I liked very much, so I went inside. It was a very fashionable clothing store, with a fat foreign old woman who was probably the owner, and several young female clerks.</p>
<p>One of the female clerks was very dazzling, wearing a very tight floral silk cheongsam, giving a sense of "graceful and upright," with a lot of powder on her face and blue eye shadow, with a bit of coquettishness in her beauty, truly a typical "vase."</p>
<p>When I told her what I wanted, she took out two boxes for me to choose from. I asked her if they had nine-inch ones. She very gently told me that nine inches were too small, that men usually wore nine and a half inches, and she looked at my feet and said that nine inches would be the most suitable for me. Her considerate and gentle attitude made me feel a little uneasy. On the one hand, I admired the foreign old woman for employing such good female clerks, which could really attract customers.</p>
<p>While I was picking, she noticed a red leather-bound book with gold lettering on the glass counter, "A History of Chinese Diplomacy." She asked me, "Are you also studying politics?" This surprised me. Why would a female clerk care about the books a customer was reading? And how could her brain, filled with powder, have any shadow of "politics" and "economics"? I casually agreed, unable to think of a way to ask her a question in return. She then said, "We don't use this kind of book." I was even more surprised. Was she also studying? So I asked her, "Are you also studying politics? Which school do you attend?" She nodded and told me the name of the school, and also said, "Classes at school start after five o'clock, so I do some work here during the day." I said, "Then we are comrades!" She smiled, and dimple-like smiles appeared on her face, asking me my name and hoping for a lot of guidance.</p>
<p>After I bought what I wanted, she sent me out. I glimpsed that she was wearing the latest style of snakeskin shoes, with a gold bracelet in her stockings.</p>
<p>On the way back, I was suspicious. How could such a glamorous young woman, whom people would definitely think was engaged in some kind of profession, be a proper college student? And why would she want to use the name of a university as a cover?</p>
<p>Under strong curiosity, one evening, I stepped into a certain university.</p>
<p>There was no such glamorous小姐 (miss/lady) in the classroom! But in a moment, I saw her, but what shocked me was that her appearance was completely different from that day, to the point that I suspected it was another person with a similar face.</p>
<p>She was wearing a sky-blue cloth cheongsam and white running shoes, how pure and simple, how gentle and quiet, diligently taking notes.</p>
<p>"They are completely different people," I wandered in the corridor. The bell rang, and students came out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to leave, she saw me.</p>
<p>"Eh, Mr. Wu..." She turned her face, which had no powder on it, towards me.</p>
<p>"Is class over?" I felt a little embarrassed and had to tell a lie to explain my intention, "I'm here to see a classmate."</p>
<p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>
<p>"He... he didn't come." I felt a little embarrassed in my heart.</p>
<p>"Then let's go back!"</p>
<p>We walked down the stairs together and stepped into the noisy city street, finally shaking hands at the entrance of her alley.</p>
<p>The next day, as I passed the fashionable clothing store again by streetcar, I curiously paid attention. Through the glass window, I glimpsed her again, with a lot of powder on her face and blue eye shadow. A wave of confusion attacked my heart.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel sad for working women.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Sino-Portuguese Cup Resolved, Chinese Team Wins Championship <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Amateur</p>
<p>The Sino-Portuguese Cup football league match between the Chinese team and the Portuguese team was held at the racecourse on the 26th of this month (this Tuesday) at 5:45 PM. As the Portuguese team won the first match, and the Chinese team won the second, this game was the focus of contention. It's no wonder both teams used their most ideal lineups, reversing the carelessness of the previous two matches. Their ambition was evident.</p>
<p>The previous issue of this publication carried Mr. Bixian's righteous argument regarding the Chinese team's lineup, including names like Jia Youliang, who was initially excluded. At the time, I found it rather strange. However, when the Football Association granted a special pardon, allowing Jia and others to participate, I realized that Mr. Bixian's contribution had already subtly conveyed this profound intention. The Football Association authorities sincerely adopted it, enabling them to achieve complete success, defeating Portugal 2-0 and bringing back the championship trophy. This is truly gratifying and congratulatory. Here is a brief account of the situation, along with commentary.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Chinese team showed great progress at the beginning, but unfortunately, due to poor coordination and a lack of effective shooters, their efforts ultimately fell short. The Portuguese team held a clear advantage. Li Tiansheng, Zhuang Youren, and others' strengths were rendered useless. In the second half, Li Yichen of the Chinese team scored a goal, but it was ruled invalid due to Xu Wenkui's offside. Soon after, Mike, from Portuguese commerce, also scored a goal, but it was also disallowed because Pantsson was offside. This can be considered a coincidence. Subsequently, Lai Hanlong and Hai's abundant stamina led to two consecutive goals, securing the victory and ensuring that the Sino-Portuguese Cup, newly revived, fell into the hands of our Chinese team.</p>
<p>Chinese Team's Strength Ultimately Triumphs</p>
<p>Overall, the match lacked exciting moments. Both sides seemed to be unfamiliar with each other. Smooth coordination and fierce tackling were not frequently seen. Regarding the situations of both teams, defense seemed to be prioritized over offense. The strategy on both sides was to disrupt the opponent's attack, while neither attack was able to find a way to break through the opponent's defense. Consequently, with neither side's offense being particularly sharp, the excitement was naturally diminished. The Chinese team's ultimate victory was due to their concerted effort. For example, Meng Yi's support and response, and Li Tiansheng's focus on Fu En, were both outstanding successes, earning praise from fans. The Portuguese team's loss was most clearly due to the major error of using Kao Si as a substitute for Xu Erzi in the second half. Xu is a defender, and trying him as a forward led to numerous loopholes, allowing Jia and Han to be very active. The Portuguese team is known for their intelligent and effective adjustments. It's unclear why they made such a mistake this time, which is truly puzzling.</p>
<p>Chinese Team Members Performed Well</p>
<p>Regarding individual techniques, Zhang Banglun was more steady than before, able to avoid losing the ball, which is commendable. Li Tiansheng was able to contain Fu En, proving that he is still strong despite his age. It's not an easy feat. Meng Yiliang, in the absence of Tan Fuzhen and Song Lingbian, took on the key role of midfielder, supporting and responding, proving to be no less capable than the two absent players. Yu Liming's speed was necessary on the defensive line. Han Longhai's ability to score goals cannot be overlooked. Han's threatening movements were undeniable. Jia Youliang spent most of the time switching positions with Han Longhai, diligently bringing the ball back. Li Yichen shook off his exhaustion. Although there were some signs of unfamiliarity, his hard work is worth mentioning. Xu Wenkui's pass from the left wing, leading to a goal, was beautiful. Han Longhai's second goal came from Xu Wenkui's pass. As for Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Gao Baozheng, and Luo Choufu, while they didn't have outstanding performances, they were able to maintain their level.</p>
<p>Portuguese Team Lacked Highlights</p>
<p>On the Portuguese side, Oliveira was the best, with a commanding presence. Second was V. Su, whose activity and long-range shots threatened our team. Fu En was effectively contained by our side, unable to display his prowess. Pantsson and his brother also failed to shine with Xing Fu En. Kao Si was increasingly steady. It's unclear why he was taken off the field in the second half. Xu Erzi and Lai Liao, the two forwards, had more courage than wisdom and are not worth mentioning. Defender Ke Yetuo was better than Victor, who was tiresome.</p>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to Order Inside the Field</p>
<p>Finally, I have another observation: there were too many spectators inside the field. The biggest shortcoming was that countless spectators stood on both sides of the goal, surrounding the goal in layers, often leaving the referee with the difficulty of making a decision. For example, when Han Longhai scored the first goal in the match, the opponent Pan Limi quickly retrieved the ball from the net. At the same time, some fans, overjoyed, rushed across the goal line to cheer, providing the opponents with an excuse to cause a dispute. The referee was indeed caught in a dilemma, unable to make a clear decision in the crowd, which was a major flaw. Secondly, the general public in the grandstand, with limited spending power, had no choice but to watch from afar. They were essentially amateur fans and wouldn't mind this. However, the fact that people inside the field were obstructing the view of the field deprived them of the opportunity to enjoy the best moments, which was disappointing. As one of the people in the grandstand, I have repeatedly complained about this situation. For most of the time, we were left with empty joy and disappointment because we couldn't see the ball near the goal. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the authorities will restrict spectators inside the field. If this affects revenue, I won't protest. But order must be maintained. In other words, spectators should be absolutely prohibited from standing near the goal. This would benefit the amateur fans in the grandstand and reduce unnecessary disputes in the match. I understand that the Football Association is currently hosting a summer football invitational tournament. I hope that this point will be seriously considered and not lightly overlooked at that time. This would be very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Unbearable to Recall Tennis: China Real Estate Tennis Club to Hold Charity Match <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>Tennis is a sport suitable for summer, but for the past year or two, this sport has been virtually silent. This year, it is even considered a sport for the nobility, making it impossible for the average person to enjoy. In fact, this sport has always been more upscale than others. However, it was still possible to勉强 purchase tennis balls in the past. This summer, amidst rising prices, the cost of tennis balls has also increased. As far as I know, a single tennis ball costs nearly 100,000 yuan. Imagine, how can the average person afford this? This is of course an inevitable result of weak purchasing power. This has buried many talented players and caused a seasonal sport to become dormant and unable to develop.</p>
<p>China was slow to develop a passion for tennis. It seems that after Qiu Feihai (deceased) and Lin Bao won the championship in the 8th Far Eastern Games, the interest of the Chinese people increased. Of course, it was not yet widespread at that time. Later, it gradually became popular, and the Chinese people gradually paid attention to it. As a result, many talents were gradually discovered, such as Zheng Zhaofu and Xu Chengji, who achieved glory overseas. In particular, Xu Chengji's level even caught up with the world stage, which clearly showed that China has a natural talent for this sport. Eight years ago, the world-famous star Tilden Barnes came to Shanghai to perform, which also increased the level of the audience at that time. Although many players have learned the secrets of the sport, unfortunately, this aristocratic sport has become more and more aristocratic, leading to a phenomenon of叹息ing at the ball.</p>
<p>In this year's reality, we didn't even want to write about this news. But out of the blue, a good news came that a sport we had almost forgotten will have an opportunity to be appreciated. Of course, this must be a masterpiece like a昙花一现, but precisely because of this, we should feel its preciousness even more, not to mention that it is a sport that is suitable for the season? That is, the China Real Estate Tennis Club will have a tennis charity match in the near future, which is of course welcome and is a charity event that benefits others. Now I would like to briefly introduce everything about the China Real Estate Tennis Club.</p>
<p>Organizational situation of China Real Estate Tennis Club</p>
<p>The China Real Estate Tennis Club is organized by members of the China Real Estate Association. The club has almost exhausted the first-rate players in Shanghai tennis. Conversely, the players who are good at tennis are suffering from the lack of opportunity to show their skills. With such an opportunity, they will naturally flock to it and gather like-minded people in one place. The China Real Estate Tennis Club has a sound team organization, with Lin Kanghou as the president, Wu Yong'an, Xu Wenzhao, and Ma Runfang as the vice presidents, Li Leishi as the general secretary, and Tang Shizhen and Ling Zhizhang as the deputy general secretaries. These are all capable talents. Therefore, the China Real Estate Tennis Club is the only one remaining in Shanghai, and it has the perseverance to organize a charity match.</p>
<p>Shanghai Tennis Will Be Brought Together</p>
<p>Looking at the list of players, there is Zhou Guanjun as the captain, and the soldiers are Wang Wenzheng, Tao Guanqiu, Wei Shisun, Wang Jichang, Jing Maoqing, Xu Chengwei, Guo Ying, Jing Renqing, Xiao Xuehai, Cai Guoji, Zhang Dingzhao, Ye Weijian, Li Leishi, Sun Yan, Fan Wencai, Meng Guangming, Jin Zhizhang, and Zhang Xiaolong, etc. Of course, it is clear at a glance that the old generals are gathered together. Newcomers are coming, and it can be called a concentration camp for tennis players. Among them, the most attention-grabbing are Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanqiu. The former's reputation as a master has a history. Tao Guanqiu was originally a professional player. Since he regained his amateur status in Hong Kong, he has relied on his youth to achieve the ultimate in his tennis skills. He is almost invincible in Shanghai, but he and Wang Wenzheng have never officially played against each other. It is said that in this charity match, the two of them have agreed to compete alone. Therefore, the mystery of Wang and Tao, although they can dominate the Shanghai tennis scene, can be solved. And the fans who have not had a wonderful tennis match for a long time will not give up this excellent opportunity. In addition, there are Ju Guanjun, Li Leishi, Zhang Dingzhao, etc., who are all famous players. Cai Guoji and Xu Chengwei are rising stars. I think in this charity match, we will definitely be able to enjoy it like a long-awaited rain after a drought.</p>
<p>Ticket Revenue Used to Fund Scholarships</p>
<p>As for the purpose of this charity match, the ticket revenue will be donated to Xinwenbao and this newspaper as scholarships to benefit poor students, which is worth promoting!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to briefly introduce the tennis court. The address is 285 Wuyuan Road (Zhao Zhujiao Road), inside the China Real Estate Association. The transportation is not very convenient. Take a tram to Shanzhong Road, and walk west along Wuyuan Road for a maximum of five minutes. The court is the most standard, and the field has been carefully laid out, so the elasticity is extremely suitable. What is more worth writing is that there is shade, so when there is a breeze, sitting on the court and watching the players perform is a refreshing experience. The only drawback is that there is not much space for spectators to accommodate on all sides, so it is inevitable that some people will be unable to watch.</p>
<p>Now, I don't want to talk more. When the club has progress news, I will report in the next issue!</p>

<p>— Miao</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Fuchu, the coach of the Panda team, a strong Chinese team in this year's Softball League, is a veteran in China's baseball world. According to records, Mr. Liang was a baseball player in Japan at the age of fifteen and has represented the Chinese team in matches in Japan and as a representative of the Far Eastern Games several times. Mr. Liang has been a baseball instructor in Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai for nearly thirty years and is famous at the time. Since Mr. Liang became the instructor of the Panda team in this year's league, their technology has improved rapidly. Admiring his name, the writer specially visited Mr. Liang at his private residence to discuss the state of baseball and softball sports in Shanghai. The interview process is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Baseball Movement in Shanghai is in the Development Era</p>
<p>Mr. Liang first said that in recent years, 관人 have gradually become interested in baseball and softball, which is a very good phenomenon. Because our country's sports have always been behind. Except for football and basketball, which are more popular, baseball and softball are rarely noticed by Chinese people. It is necessary to promote this. In the Far Eastern Games, the Chinese people's baseball is a great witchcraft compared with Japan and the Philippines. In the past two or three years, there has been a softball league sponsored by Westerners in the summer. Only the Panda team has joined. According to Mr. Liang's 40 years of experience, observing the baseball and softball technology of various teams in Shanghai today, he said that they are still in their infancy, but they will definitely develop in the future. He believes that in the future international relations, baseball and softball will definitely surpass football and basketball, which is Mr. Liang's assertion. Therefore, Mr. Liang first hopes that the press and sports circles will vigorously promote volleyball, and secondly, he hopes that more Chinese people will organize baseball and softball teams, and use competitions to improve technology and interest. Finally, Mr. Liang added that he will organize a baseball club to train future generations, so that our country's baseball can be as popular and developed as football and basketball, and that our country will also occupy a considerable position in the international baseball world.</p>
<p>Each team's short-hitting defense lacks precision training</p>
<p>Last Sunday (24th), the Panda team was scheduled to compete with the Philippine Overseas Chinese team. Later, the Philippine team temporarily misrepresented the information, and the Panda team changed to a friendly match with a mixed team of Japanese Overseas Chinese and the Western Youth team. On that day, there were thousands of spectators. Under the tactical guidance of Mr. Liang, the Chinese team won 8-4. In this match, the mixed team played with the most ideal lineup, such as pitcher Kaiji Milov, catcher Burke and Miura, shortstop Ueshima and other famous generals. In the third inning, the mixed team took a 2-0 lead. In the fourth inning, Wang Nianzu of the Chinese team got a "second base hit", and later catcher Wang Xiushan hit a medium-high ball "sacrifice hit", allowing Wang Nian to score a point. In the fifth inning, the mixed team got a "full base" (Po ll base) and no outs (No down) with a good batting. Under this critical situation, it was Kouri's turn to bat. He swung with all his might and hit a fast ball that was intercepted by shortstop Liang Youji, and Maus, who was on second base, was called out by Jie Yousheng. Later, Mr. Liang quickly made a three-player out, allowing Nogami to exit. This three-kill (Triple kill) scene was clear and fast, winning a lot of praise. At this time, the situation changed. Coach Liang quickly guided the Chinese team to use short attacks. Sure enough, in the fifth inning, the Chinese team, led by Liang Youyi, Wen Ruixiong, Wen Tianhua, and Li Qi, continued to use short hits to get on base and score points, turning defeat into victory. In this match, Mr. Liang said that the teams in Shanghai lack training in short-hitting defense technology. If they can use short hits, they will cause panic and confusion in other teams. Therefore, the Chinese team also used short hits in this match, causing the mixed team to be exhausted and finally losing their position. Mr. Liang also stated that in a softball match, the offense should use more short hits, because softball is not as strong as baseball, and nineteen out of ten balls are intercepted by the outer wings. This can be seen from the fact that the Chinese team's victory over the Samurai on Thursday was entirely due to short hits. In this match, the Chinese team's defense was precise. Wen Ruixiong got a "full base hit" in the sixth inning, and in the fourth and fifth innings, the Chinese team frequently used short bats, and the players went on base like a revolving lantern. As a result, they won 12-0, which was also the result of Mr. Liang's guidance.</p>
<p>Whether the team can win depends on the fighting spirit</p>
<p>Mr. Liang finally said that the most important thing in baseball games is fighting spirit, which is a matter of experience. I still remember that in 19 every time in the Sino-Japanese Championship final in Yokohama, Japan, Japan still took the lead by one point in the last inning. After Mr. Liang repeatedly guided and supervised the battle, the Chinese team relied on the fighting spirit of the last minute to get a "full base hit" and reverse the defeat into victory. Therefore, Mr. Liang said that whether a ball game can be won depends on whether there is a fighting spirit, and the ball skills are secondary. Therefore, the teams he guides are calm in the face of battle. For example, when the Panda team was fighting, Liang Yousheng was the pitcher. Because of leg cramps, coach Liang still did not allow anyone to replace him. Once, the catcher's face was injured, but he was still not allowed to leave the field. He had to fight to the end, fearing that it would shake the single-mindedness and lead to a defeat. Mr. Liang's emphasis on fighting spirit is also evident in Hong Kong. The local Western newspaper called Mr. Liang "Grandpa Liang." (Graudpa Liang) Because every time during a game, Liang Ruo would be present to supervise the battle, exhorting and guiding them, just like an old man's teaching.</p>
<p>The Pandas will fight the Japanese on the afternoon of July 4</p>
<p>Next Thursday (July 5), at 4:30 PM at the Russian Sports Association Stadium on Xiafei Road, Pan Sheng Road (Wuxing Road), the Pandas will face the strongest Japanese team in this year's league. This battle is related to the future championship, and the skills of the two teams are equal. According to Mr. Liang's observation, the Japanese team's offense is better than its defense, such as the left-handed hitter 岛 and Miura. Nogami. Suro are all good at hitting. These Japanese players who studied in the United States have the same style as the Americans, and their actions are smooth and their English is fluent. Now Mr. Liang knows that the Japanese team knows how to be careful to prevent the Chinese team from using short hits, so they will change their tactics. Both sides will do their best in this battle. This international ball game is free of charge and will attract a large number of fans. Before the game, the Panda B team will compete with the Soviet team starting at 3:00 PM. The strength of these two teams is also very strong, and there will also be a fierce battle.</p>
<h3 id="e65">My Views on the Revision of Round Gate Ball Rules (Part Two) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Di Xianzhang</p>
<p>According to Chapter Nine, "Game Terminology and Explanations," there are only twenty-one items listed. However, if the attacking team's forward dribbles the ball into the opponent's zone and attacks the goal, but the defending team's defender uses legitimate defensive techniques to prevent a close attack, in several previous games, the attacking team's forward often used quick running movements to throw the ball back to their own zone. This caused the defending team's forwards and defenders to tire from running, ultimately achieving the completion of the attack. This technique, when used between teams of comparable strength, can lead to frequent exciting plays. Unfortunately, when there is a slight disparity in the strength of the two teams, it easily creates a situation of "superior strategy" and "being tied hand and foot." As a result, the winner becomes even stronger, and the loser becomes even more discouraged, leading to unequal benefits. Therefore, it is stipulated that "after the attacking team enters the opponent's zone, they must not retreat to their own backcourt before shooting," and the penalty rules are as follows: "Retreating to the backcourt results in a dead ball, and a player from the opposing team throws the ball into the field near the sideline where the ball landed in the backcourt to continue the game." However, if the opposing team's player gains possession of the ball when it lands in the backcourt, it is not considered a retreat to the backcourt.</p>
<p>Holding the Ball for Three Seconds</p>
<p>This violation is adapted from American basketball rules, with modifications. An attacking team player, whether in their own zone or the opponent's zone, must not hold the ball motionless for three seconds. Otherwise, at the nearest sideline outside the area where the violation occurred, a player from the opposing team throws the ball into the field to continue the game. This rule was introduced because, during an attack, the attacking team would suddenly stop, wait for the defending team's players to take their positions, and then suddenly continue the attack, catching the defending team off guard and putting them in a virtually impossible situation. This technique was especially common when the score was tied. Therefore, the violation of holding the ball for one second was specified.</p>
<p>Two-Handed Dribbling</p>
<p>In the original rules, Chapter Nine, "Game Terminology and Explanations," item seventeen, "Returning the Ball," states: "After a player gains possession of the ball, throwing, dribbling, or rolling the ball, touching the ball again before it is touched by a second person is called dribbling." Although it does not explicitly state whether to use one hand or two, in practice, except for bouncing the ball, whether dribbling or rolling, one hand is always used. Using two hands is, in effect, a violation. Furthermore, dribbling simultaneously or alternating hands while dribbling is also a violation. The penalty is the same as in basketball.</p>
<p>The above four items have all been corrected, and all team players participating in the cup competition should be familiar with them. The following items are merely my personal opinions. Whether they are appropriate or not, I hope that the knowledgeable readers, referees, and senior figures will provide corrections. I would be most grateful!</p>
<p>Various ball games are often divided into A and B groups based on physical strength so that the exercise can fully showcase skills without harming health. In past round gate ball competitions, the size of the field and the number of players on the field were the same for both A and B groups in the men's division. However, in my opinion, A-group players are fully developed and physically strong. According to Mr. Qian's specified rule, Chapter One, "Field," note three, which states: "The area of a large field and the number of players in the game are the same as in soccer," then the A-group teams should use a soccer field and the number of soccer players. I imagine this would lead to many more exciting plays. B-group players are not fully developed, or even if they are, their skills are inferior. Therefore, they should use a smaller soccer field and the number of players on that field. In the women's division, physiological conditions do not allow for excessively strenuous exercise. Therefore, I advocate adopting the Qian Wei zone system, where the forwards are always in the opposing zone and cannot enter their own zone (except during the kickoff), and the three defenders are always in their own zone and cannot enter the opposing zone. This is the same as the rules for women's basketball. As for other rules, many more should be adopted from women's basketball rules to make them physiologically suitable. The size of the field should be the same as that for small rubber balls. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Game Time</p>
<p>In the original rules, the actual playing time for men's games is stipulated as forty minutes, with the entire game divided into two halves, each half being twenty minutes, with a ten-minute break between the two halves. For women and junior high school students, the total game time should be changed to thirty-two minutes, with each half being sixteen minutes, with a ten-minute break between the two halves. In my opinion, following the original text for the Shenbao players, the B-group players should change to two halves, each half further divided into two quarters, each quarter being ten minutes, with a five-minute break between the two quarters. For women and junior high school students, it should also be divided into four quarters, each quarter being eight minutes, with a three-minute break between the first and second quarters, and another three-minute break between the third and fourth quarters, with a ten-minute break between the two halves. This is the second point. (End)</p>
