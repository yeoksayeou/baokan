<h3>呂宋馬納奧附近　日精銳部隊猛攻　仁牙因灣敵軍圖南下被阻</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫二十日中央社電　仁牙因灣登陸敵軍，企圖沿通向馬尼刺之公路南進，日軍精銳在瑪納奧附近加以猛攻，十七日斃敵二百，毁戰車三輛，十八日繼續邀擊增援之敵軍，使其戰車四輛起火，而將其擊退。呂宋北面之日軍各部隊，亦連日以突擊隊深入敵陣地，將敵軍主力之前進基地悉行粉碎，以故敵軍不得不抽調仁牙因北方地方聖多羅瑪斯等地登陸之兵力，以加强南翼。又敵軍自十八日以來，迭以B24型，P38型等基地空軍掩護仁牙因灣登陸之軍隊，同時並强化對南部呂宋之偵察，顯出欲乘呂宋決戰時，由仁牙因灣附近更向他方移動企圖。</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　美聯社呂宋島前綫訊：仁牙爵灣通達馬尼刺之公路上，過去二十四小時日。美兩軍展開激烈之戰車戰。日軍二名身携炸彈炸毀美戰車，因之美軍士兵震驚異常。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地二十日中央社電　日空軍自十八日夜至十九日晨，曾兩次猛炸干莫狄斯海坡書島之敵部隊海岸附近，敵陣地數處被炸粉碎。</p>
<p>日軍戰果擴大中</p>
<p>仁牙因前綫二十日中央社電　仁牙因灣登陸之敵軍，在猛烈之砲擊與轟炸掩護下，逐次有南下趨勢。十六日以來，遭日軍猛攻反擊後，其焦盧之進攻，遂被阻止。待機出動之日軍精銳，十六日晚以有力部隊向聖法比安方面敵主力橋頭堡一綫開始猛攻，深入敵陣，同時一部目海岸實行逆登陸，擊敵腹背，幷將海岸公路上及民家中推積之敵彈藥，戰車，汽車等燒毁炸碎，使敵陣陷於大混亂。同時，日軍區砲亦猛烈射擊，日空軍亦向敵投彈如雨，空陸齊猛攻，已使仁牙因灣岸敵軍大受驚駭。十七日晨自日軍陣地離海，聖法比安敵陣一帶黑烟冲天，燃料爆發之聲極爲凄慘，突破敵陣歸還陣地之日軍佐藤中尉所率部隊，曾將敵軍M4型戰車四輛，自動砲四十門，汽車八輛炸破，其他主力部隊炸毁燃燒敵軍彈藥庫，堆棧無數，戰果仍繼續擴大中。</p>
<h3>菲律賓綜合戰况</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　菲律賓戰况如次：敵美軍在仁牙因灣登陸設立橋頭堡吿一段落後，漸轉爲運動戰，敵軍以四個師團，內有戰車師團之登陸軍主力，自仁牙因灣東北岸經卡保南山進攻，利用展向南方之波狀高原地帶，構築陣地之日軍第一綫部隊及聖法比安以北地區方面敵軍，突遭日軍出擊行動，極爲消極。達莫爾迭斯方面，於海岸綫附近聖法比安及阿拉坎附近敵軍，在沿海岸約四公里之綫上構築陣地，準備應戰，聖法比安以南之戰綫，敵軍攻勢極爲活躍。另一部敵軍則侵入比提附近，聖法比安東方六公里之日軍第一綫陣地，刻正日軍於第一綫陣地前方及第一綫，第二綫之中間地區邀擊該部敵軍。仁牙因灣西方高地日軍右翼陣地對面之敵軍，行動極呈緩慢，仁牙因機塲之一部，目十五日頃，敵已開始使用少數之小型機。又敵自仁牙因及達古旁向班加新安平原南進，漸進至阿古諾河一帶，其一部則渡過該河，進攻南岸地區，聖法比安以北日軍，目十六日夜以來，即加强衝鋒戰法，已使敵軍爲之震駭，十六日夜間之戰果，業由日大本迷營於十九日發表，其後所與敵軍之損傷爲數尤多。仁牙因西方高地之日軍，亦已展開勇敢之衝鋒戰，並妨礙敵軍使用仁牙因機塲，已獲甚大戰果，日空軍深知敵軍侵襲呂宋之野心，於敵軍接近仁牙因海岸以來，速日全機化爲特攻隊，猛炸敵艦船軍，現更對敵軍補給船團施以痛擊。雷伊泰及明多羅島方面，其後幷無多大變化，日軍刻仍在邀擊敵軍中。又敵機動部隊以第三十八機動部隊爲主幹，其後曾侵入中國南海，幷於十二日，十五日，十六日分別來襲台灣，中國南部沿岸廣州，香港及海南島附近等地，其後似仍在呂宋島西北方海面遊弋中。</p>
<h3>塔別金對岸　敵陣地被炸</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫二十日中央社電　日空軍曾於十八日中午猛炸曼達萊正北約七十公里伊洛瓦底河附近塔別金對岸之敵軍陣地，炸毁地上設施三處，日機全部安返基地。又敵P47型機百架，曾於十六日來襲緬甸中部梅克塞拉地區，日空軍亦曾予以邀擊，計擊落二架，擊毁一架。</p>
<h3>呂宋海域敵艦船　共沉毀一二一艘</h3>
<p>—日空軍及水上部隊戰果—</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫二十日中央社電　日空軍及水上部隊，累次猛攻呂宋島海域之敵艦船，並於敵在仁牙因灣登陸時予以重創，本月三日至十二日間，日軍所獲綜合戰果如次：擊沉敵航空母艦八艘，戰艦一艘，其他艦艇十二艘，運輸船七十七艘，擊毁起火者計敵空母一艘，戰艦及其他艦艇八艘，運輸船十四艘，即除擊沉，擊毁敵空母九艘外，更擊沉，擊毁敵艦艇二十一艘，內有戰艦，運輸船九十一艘，總計擊沉，擊毁敵艦船一百二十一艘。</p>
<h3>日貴衆兩院　今開全體會　首外相將作施政演說</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日貴衆兩院二十一日再開，其日程如次：貴族院上午十時舉行全體會議，小磯首相及重光外相演說施政方針，自上午九時五十分起，舉行各常任委員會，選正副委員長。衆議院下午一時舉行全體會議，首由小磯首相，重光外相作施政演說，繼由石渡藏相演說財政方針，次由金光庸夫代表質問，關於一般國政戰爭指導之根本方針，決戰行政之澈底及戰時外交之積極化等，中島彌團次觥質問軍需生產，勞務運轍及財政各問題，最後由木村正義氏質問國民生活之確保，食糧增產及物價防空各問題。</p>
<p>日國民動員時令策要綱</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日政府前在五大緊急施策之第四項中，標榜加强勤勞態勢與國民全面勞動動員，近以厚生省爲中心，已制定具體方策，十日之總動員審議會，已決定關於國民動員之時令策要綱。按該要綱之目的，在使軍動員與勤勞動員得以急連進展，並謀空襲下對緊急事態得發揮其特效之機能，而使國民勤勞之全能力得發揮至最高度，故亦可謂爲動員全權委任法，或「動員根本法」，其主要內容爲必要人員與就職之確保動員準備之合理化，動員方式之整備機能配置之法制化及動員行政改善策。</p>
<h3>日以增加稅收　充臨時經費</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日政府對處置戰費支出之增大，曾決定自昭和二十年度起實行平年度約十八億元之增稅案，同時，於此次議會中並曾提出所得稅法等十六法律改正案。又爲謀以上增稅及專賣基金之增收，並決定增收紙烟價格，茲石藕直於十六日之閣議席上曾擬案提出執吿，要求各閣員之諒解，十九日下午三時，並由日大藏相正式發表，昭和二十年度之增收額，爲六億九千餘萬元，合計前二次之增收，已達未曾有之巨額，由此項增稅額及增加之專賣金之收入，故國庫收入上已達二十五億元之巨額。又此次因增價之增收額，決定全部充作臨時軍事費特別會計。</p>
<h3>襲阪神敵機　捐傷廿三架</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵B29型機十九日下午約八十架來襲日本大阪神戶地區之工業地帶，經日軍邀擊，調查戰果，對其約十分之三之二十三架，予以損傷，其中數架已判明確實擊落，日方未歸還三架。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　馬利亞納基地之B29型機約八十架，曾於十九日下午一時四十八分，分數梯國由紀伊半島方面侵入大阪·神戶地區，並投下炸彈及燒夷彈，至二時三十分許，即向南方海上遁去。按此次敵以有力編隊來襲大阪·神戶地區，乃係初次，敵之攻擊意在破壞日方補給泉源，更致力破壞飛行生產機構，然因日方制空部隊之勇猛邀擊及地上防衛陣營之鞏固，是故受害極微。至於日軍制空部隊之邀擊戰果，現正調查中。又近頃敵以少數飛機來襲名古屋，靜岡縣及關東地方，並於瑩柱附近投彈，但日方被害皆甚輕微。</p>
<h3>澳門被炸　葡領事談話</h3>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電　葡萄牙駐廣州領事館副領事愛基古拉斯氏，曾於十八日下午就澳門被炸情形發表談話稱：茲因未接該地政府公吿，故不明被炸詳情，至爲遺憾，然美機旣往返轟炸三次，決非誤認目標，同時居住澳門之華僑基多，彼等對美機之暴行，當爲激憤也。</p>
<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>學費徵收標準與敎員薪給支配問題</h3>
<p>— 曾尼維</p>
<p>自從本月九日市敎育局頒佈私立中小學征收學生費用標準規定高中學費七千五百元，初中六千元，小學高級四千元，中級三千六百元，低級三千二百元後，據說有一部份私立中小學校爲此曾經一再開會商討，幷一度推派代表直接與市敎育當局討論，要求顧及敎職員生活的困難，對業已頒佈的學費征收標準，予以合理的調整。但當局認爲如果學費跟隨一般物價的漲勢而任意抬高，必將召致失學人數激增的惡果，故表示希望本市敎育界以「爲敎育而敎育」的精神，協助當局推進搶救失學的辦法，對業已頒布的學費標準，則不擬再加調整的考慮云。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形下，各私立中小學校的反應如何？據調查所得，分爲兩種態度，一是「我行我素」，一是「暫且觀望」。對於這種態度的評價如何，我們姑置不論，但這是一個關心敎育前途者所値得注視的嚴重問題，却是無法諱言的。</p>
<p>很顯明的這個問題的重心所在，就是學費征收標準的是否顧及學生家長負担，與依恃學費收入維持生活的敎職員的生活間題，如果學費征收標準對這兩方面都能顧及，則私立中小學之藉口無法維持敎職員生活而任意抬高學費，置失學人數因其高抬學費而至激增於不顧，則敎育當局乃至於行政最高機關，都應該以敎育爲重而對不遵法令的私立學校，採取斷然的手段，以示政府維護敎育的決心。另一方面，如果遵照學費標準的結果，在事實上確實無法維持敎職員生活時，我們根據國家最高機關頒佈今後國策之一的「安定民生」的立塲，希望教育當局，亦以維護敎育的決心，顧到上海目前的現實，對已頒佈的法令加以合理的調整。否則，在敎職員生活無法維持之下，優良師資的逃避，其結果亦同樣將不堪設想。</p>
<p>按照以往敎育當局的課程標準，中等學校課程，人數，敎員任課時間的支配如下：（一）每級人數最少三十名，最多五十名。（二）每週每班上課節數，以三十節爲標準，每節五十分鐘。（三）每一專任敎員，以每週授課二十節爲最高原則。</p>
<p>至於敎職薪的支配原則，是；所有全部學費收入的總數，扣除校舍房租之後，以百分之三十爲學校經常費，百分之七十爲敎職員薪給。至於敎職員薪給的支配，則又以敎職員薪給中之百分之卅爲職員薪給，百分之七十爲敎員薪給。</p>
<p>依照上述標準，而配以戰時環境的變通！假定每級學生人數爲四十名，專任敎員增加其工作時間，每週授課三十節計，按照市敎育局學生費用征收標準計算：（初中收費標準）</p>
<p>每級收入學費爲二十四萬元。</p>
<p>每級每月敎室租金，姑以二百元論，計一千二百元。按照二十三萬八千八百元的百分之三十，即七萬一千六百四十元劇作學校經常費外，尙餘十六萬七千一百六十元。再從中提取百分之三十的職薪計五萬零一百四十八元，所餘敎薪計十一萬七千零十二元。每月敎薪（六個月計）爲一萬九千五百零二元，每週敎薪爲四千八百七十五元五角。又以每週每班上課三十節計，每節敎薪合計約一百六十二元五角。專任敎員每週授課三十節計，每週獲敎薪四千八百七十五元，月薪一萬九千三百六十元。以此數目而欲維持目前的上海生活，即以「單身漢」而論，亦無法維持其一日三餐的最低生活要求，這是鐵一樣的事實；至於要仰事俯畜，即以一家四口而論，雖以按月可領三斗「重點配結米」，折合近日最高黑市米價每擔四萬元，合得一萬二千元，總計月入三萬一千三百六十元。這數目的收入，如欲負擔四口之家的生活，確是很困難的。不過，如果政府有確實的把握，能够設法彌補全市敎職員在遵照局頒學費標準之後，因而缺欠的生活費用，則各私立中小學校之應絕對遵照政府法令，自毋庸異議，否則，敎育當局也應重視現實，不能置敎職員的生活於不顧。</p>
<p>但是，以過去一個學期的事實而論，本市私立學校校長，幾無不大獲厚利，其以學費收入用作開設火腿店，以及以學費所得，用作校畏「跑單帮」的資本的，（見一月十八日新中國報載「學店調查紀實」）固無論矣，即使「安份守已」，僅將所收學費放息岡利者而言，則其利息所入，亦大有可觀。姑再以上述例證計算之，校長入息，其實際收支情形如下；</p>
<p>每級收入二十四萬元，月以利率一角計，第一個月底支付職敎薪時，每級實際收入已爲二十六萬四千元。付第一個月敎職薪給二萬七千八百六十元，又第一個月敎室租金二百元，合計萬八千零六十元。再加學校經常費一萬一千九百四十元，總計第一個月支出四萬元。</p>
<p>以後支出依舊，而收入仍照上法計算，六個月後，收支相抵，可獲純利十一萬六千餘元。支出項下的敎職員薪給，每月依舊，房租方面，事實上亦絕少增加，經常費方面，每月每敎室，決無如許鉅額支出。</p>
<p>所以，照此計算，每一個有四十名學生的敎室，校長最低限度在一學期內，可獲純利十一萬六千五百餘元。倘高初中共計六級，每級四十名者，校長所獲純利即達六十九萬九千八百餘元。這一筆鉅額的入息，取自敎職員的勞力與勞心上，而歸入於校長個人的私囊。則此事實的太欠公允，亦未始不是一件無容諱言的事實。我們認爲敎職員薪給的支配，必需重加調整，以求合理的達到同甘共苦，不至苦樂殊懸的公平地步。</p>
<p>至於如何的支配辦法始爲合理，可以提供參考者，有下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）敎職員薪給，於開學時一筆支付六個月。</p>
<p>（二）敎職員薪給，於開學時預付三個月，其餘三個月再分爲六份，按月支發。</p>
<p>（三）提取每月由學費所得利息的百分之七十，作爲敎職薪之外的「生活津貼」。（例如第一個月收入拆息二萬四千元，應提一萬六千八百元作爲敎職員薪給之外的「生活津貼」。餘則歸作校長「生活津貼」，以示公允。）</p>
<p>本來按照部頒的敎職薪支配辦法，自是一個公允的處置，然而，當這辦法頒佈之時，不論幣値的陞降也不論物價的波動，都沒有現在這樣的瘋在，所以，爲適應目前這個經濟狀態，爲獲得敎育界中的「勞資雙方」的生活的合理解決，事實上自不能不予以變更。關於這一點，也正需要私立中小學校的校長們，能够深以被議爲「學店老闆」爲最大恥辱，而以公平的態度，與敎職員秉「同舟共濟」的精神，盡心力於國家民族生命所寄的敎育事業；同時，也期待於政府當局，正視現實的困難事實，對於失學的搶救，自應全力顧及，而對敎職員生活的維持，也要同樣加以重視。</p>

<p>東京二十日中央社電　仁牙因灣南海岸之美軍，自九日登陸以來，傾全力於該地設置橋頭堡，邇來復發動攻勢，但在仁牙因達古馴歐洲之海岸附近，曾遭日軍猛烈之反擊，而犧牲基大，目下已進出於仁牙因南方十公里與達古旁南方二十五公里間之阿古諾河，其一部已越過阿古諾河之南岸。又聖法比安正面之敵軍，亦同時擴大橋頭堡，並利用高約百米乃至二百米之波狀地帶建築工事，他方美軍一部曾突入日軍第一綫陣地，故戰事日趨激化，然呂宋島之戰，若由大體觀之，所謂雙方主力之決戰，仍不達頂點。菲律賓方面日軍最高指揮官山下大將，於赴任後旋即命令部下謂，菲島地域廣大，務須發揮作戰之精神云云。按呂宋島形似大陸，地理上附有大陸戰之性格，爲日軍最得意之戰塲，日軍主力極度合用呂宋島地理之特性，以磐石不動之守勢，枕戈以待。自敵登陸後，日軍突擊隊連日連夜持戰竿，手榴彈潛入敵軍陣地，勇猛攻戰，十六日夜日軍有力之突擊隊數組，曾對聖法比安阿拉坎，聖法比安東方六公里拉布列，聖法比安東方七公里等地之敵軍陣地作壯烈之突擊，而收莫大戰果。是夜日佐藤中尉率領突擊隊兵員，乘夜突入阿拉坎敵陣地，擊毁新戰車八輛，自動砲四十六門，摩托卡車多輛，更炸毀長約一公里之糧秣彈藥庫，而佐藤中尉行單身突進聖法比安東方六公里比提之敵陣地，以手榴彈炸毁敵軍幕舍十一處，迄今晨全隊無事凱旋返防。又浦上少尉率領之突擊隊，曾於十六日夜攻入拉布轟之敵陣地，而殺戮多數敵軍，並鹵獲重機槍四挺，輕機槍三挺，自動步槍一支，手槍及機關槍彈藥約二千顆。又其他攻入聖法比安之日軍挺身隊，亦獲得莫大成功。十六日夜敵軍中曾發生大爆炸而起火，故有多處被燃燒。又聖法比安拉布聶及阿拉坎一帶之敵砲兵陣地，連日來曾向日軍陳地作猛烈砲擊，然經日軍突擊隊進攻，十六日夜至十八日晨已歇聲掩息，全然停頓。同時，聖法比安以北地區之敵軍，經日精銳部隊猛烈進攻後，至十七日止，敵死亡約一千六百名，但因日軍衝鋒而被殺戮者不在內，此外並毁敵重砲一門，擊沉舟艇十四艇。又其他重輕機槍，手槍及汽車等被鹵獲及破壞者爲數極多。今日軍主力部隊尙未活動，而敵軍即已蒙受重創，是故日軍突擊之戰術，已使敵軍膽寒矣。</p>

<h3>緊急呼籲！</h3>
<p>十天以內　達到目的　五千學子　翹首以待</p>
<p>「短短的十天，必須達到預定的目標」，——二千萬元。因爲再過十天，各校開學，淸寒學子，彷彿嗷嗷待哺的小鳥，等候助學金的頒發。而我們奔走呼號，幾於力竭聲斯，五十天來，所得捐款，僅及目標十分之六；即使餘數募足，尙還不敷分配，粥少僧多，總覺左右爲難。有些人常代爲憂慮，以爲四千五百餘學子，即使募足四千五百萬，每人所得，不過一萬元，事實上這一萬元，還是不够應付。話是不錯，但我們有堅定的信念，十天之內，一定可以達到目標，况上海有如許之多的熱心人士，如許之多的殷實富商，難道會隔岸觀火麽？我想：誰也不願使淸寒學子無端失學！更誰也不願助學運動瀕於絕境！我們惟一的願望，便是各界賢達，迅賜捐款，光陰如矢，請勿躊躇！請勿觀望！淸寒學子，不勝迫切待命之至。</p>

<p>學費徵收標準問題特輯</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>本學期已經終了，轉瞬下學期開始，對於下學期各級學校徵收學費問題，雖經市敎育局公布收費標準，但以立塲各異，持論不一，學校方面以物價高漲，主張比例提高學費；學生家長方面，則以生活高壓，不勝負担，主張學費不應急劇增加；敎職員方面則以待遇菲薄，希望學校以增收學費所入，改善待遇。而敎局規定標準，自亦有其客觀理由爲根據，決非輕易決定。本報接到各方面表示意見的來函頗多，茲選擇數篇編爲特輯，盡量保留論者主觀意見，提供當局以及關心敎育人士作客觀判斷，以期引起研究，得到比較合理的結論。除本緝刋出四篇外，另一篇移載星期評論，希讀者注意。此外，並聞敎育當局已在考慮增加收費標準，決定公布。其主旨當仍須顧到家長負担與學校實際開支，而決不如若干私立學校所定標準之高，可以想見。</p>
<h3>救救小學生家長</h3>
<p>— 大可</p>
<p>最近物價騰踊，一般小學生的家長，不但負担着全家生活的重壓，額外還須籌措子女下學期學費。據敎育局所訂私立中小學校徵收學費最高檩準，限定小學低級不得超過三二〇〇元。中級不得超過三六〇〇元。高級不得超過四〇〇〇元。（見本月九日申報）然而事實上大相逕庭。據筆者所聞，中西小學決定兩萬兩千元，彼得小學內定兩萬元，其他私立小學普遍在一萬以上，遵照市敎育局最高標準收費的，可說絕無僅有。假定一位家長須供四個學齡兒童入學，連書籍等費，勢必籌措近十萬元的支出，試問現在生活如此困難，大多數家長無力負担，結果祗有輟學一途。或者有人說道校學費太高，可改入他校，但是一則學費普遍地增高，二則小學生的學校，勢必選擇離家較近，往返便利的學校，時常沒有改校的可能。</p>
<p>一般小學把學費定得如此之高，不知根據什麽標準計算。假定照每一小學生學費兩萬元計算，一班四十人，（事實上五十人左右）可收八十萬元。敎職員薪俸以百分之七十計算，（照敎育局所訂收費標準第四條）可得五十六萬元，小學平均每班敎員一人，那末每月薪俸所得，（以六個月平均）不下於十萬元，不獨大學敎授的俸給，望塵莫及，即以一般人的薪水而論，也未必有如此之高！</p>
<p>敎育局旣訂有徵收學費的最高標準，對於這些不照標準而竟超過標準七八倍收費的學校，究竟抱什麼態度？爲維持政府威信，减少失學起見，對已收的超過部分，應勒令退還。已訂而未收的，勒令改訂。倘有違令的，逕令校董會改聘校長敎職員。</p>
<p>最後筆者對於這些超過標準七八倍收費的學校，有一言奉吿。敎育是一種工作而不是營業。在這動亂的時代，敎育是復興民族的最主要的一環，獻身於敎育的人，一方面固須維持最低限度的生活，一方面也須抱着爲敎育而犧牲的精神，不能汲汲於物質的舒適。現在一般人生活如此困難，小學學費如此之高，直接迫今學生輟學，間接斬斷國家命脈，這又豈是辦理敎育者的初衷？况且雖說物價高昻，小學敎員月取薪達十萬元，也不免自奉太豐了罷？</p>
<h3>學費問題的我見</h3>
<p>— 錢天起</p>
<p>這次各報發表了限制私立學校學費標準的消息以後，有許多家長　見了，便懸了一口氣，但是敎育界人士看了非常惶惑。一部分認眞辦理敎育的私校當局，一面要顧到學生家長的担負，一面要顧到敎員生活與敎學效率，一方又要顧到功令；因此遭遇到空前的困難人。在這裏，本人姑以市民的立塲，對於學費問題（限中小學）略加商討，並提出對策，以供關心敎育的人士的參考。</p>
<p>（一）本學期一般私校的槪況：一般水準以上的私校，上學期學費，高中約六千元，初中五千八百元小學四千元（規定學費時米價每石八千元）敎俸都佔總收入百分之七十以上。敎員薪金以時數計，每週每小時高中約二百元初中一百八十元小學每五十分鐘約一百二十元，專任敎員授課時數，平均二十五小時，每月薪水，高中二萬元，初中一萬八千元，小學級任一萬二千元。這些學校因學生較多，收入較裕，所以大都自動放棄請求配給食米及敎育會津貼。每周授課時數中學都在三十一小時以上，小學千四百分鐘以上，對於課程支配與敎學進度，及學生的課業總習與成績老查，都能一循戰前舊貫，不稍鬆懈。到了現在一學期總算安穩地過去了。下學期學費，高中約三萬元，初中十萬七千元，小學一萬六千元。據本人所知，大部份學校，在發表學費數額後，繳納定額金的學生，均在百分之八十以上。至於水準以下的學校本期學費在三五千之間，但有些僅上半日課，域每周時數僅二十五小時左右。敎俸僅能供給敎員備人的最低生活。敎員及學生自由缺席。敎員需質愈趨低劣。學生除上課外無任何作業。</p>
<p>（二）關於最近的學費通令之檢討：據申報上發表的消息下期高中學費規定七千五百元，初中六千元，小學五千元。此外增加食米配給量（最近每人每月三斗）且撥發行政津貼費。這一計劃原也是相當合理的；但是各私校當局及敎員何以要羣情惶惑起來呢，其原因有三。第一，據說此次學費標準的擬一定，是還在米價一萬二千元的時候，現在物價激漲，如仍不加以修改，那麽再過了一二個月，學校簡直要成爲枯魚之即了。第二，食米配給本月份已增至三斗，足供一個半人的消耗，平均三口之家，還有一個半人沒有着落（這是指吃生米而已）至於敎俸收人如依規定標準，大约跟本学期一样，在一二萬之間，這數目究竟可以買多少煤球，多少靑菜，幾斤黄油，幾雙襪子呢？萬一配給發生阻礙時，它的後果可想而知的。因此一般敎員不免要惶惑起來了。第三，假定行政津貼費，平均每校每學期可得五十萬元，但依目前物價指數推算，下學期每校的校舍校具的修理購置職員校工膳食，水電租稅，敎學消耗，雜項消耗，僅這幾方面，每月已在五十萬以上，試問收支預算如何可以平衡？何况上海應受津貼的大中小學數目，泱不止在三百校以下，每校是否平均可得五十萬元也還成問題。因此各校當局都不免有點疑慮。</p>
<p>（三）學費增加之合理的標準：一個上軌這的國家，學費本來不成問題。小學非但不收費，連敎科書都由國家供給，但過去上海三百萬人口，學齡兒童在二十五萬人以上，而市立的中小學學額還不滿五萬，因此私校便應運而生。但到了现在，人民的購買力極度義疲的時候，中下階級家庭，再也担負不了私校學費了，於是有學費限制的呼聲。說到私校學費標準，我以爲應該只有一個公式：</p>
<p>（全校敎員平均一家三口的衣食住醫的最低費用十全校行政費）—（致府津貼十食米及日用品配給）學生應負的學費總數</p>
<p>中國人一向自詡爲尊師重道的國家，難道可以坐視敎師囚首（現在理一次髮五百元）垢身（洗一次澡要一千），鶉衣百結（一套老布短衫褲連工要八千元）嗎？難這可以坐視敎師妻寒兒饑，枵腹而登講堪嗎？難道可以坐視敎師營養不良，抱病從公（現在傷一次風發一次熟，連醫帶藥要二千元）嗎，如果政府顧恤學生家庭不能負擔鉅額學費，也只可由政府設法去予以救濟，不可單從减低敎員的最低生活費用着想。如果認爲政府無力負擔那只好讓學生家長多負擔些。要知道現在可的公司一匹荷蘭牛的每月食料要多少中儲劵，難道一個敎師敎學的價値眞的還不及十來磅的牛奶嗎。奶棚管理人也知道奶牛的食料還很可以减少一些，質地還很可以稍劣，但是一算牛奶的分泌量也要隨之减少，便要不惜工本了。這便是所謂最低限度的生活費用。總之一分錢一分貨，如要馬兒好，只得讓牠多吃草，我相信學生家長在可能範圍之內，總願意暫時忍受一下，使他的子弟，不至失學，總不至貪一時的小便宜，而使子弟受了怠敎罷敎的影響而枉費一學期的光陰。要知道子女的敎育費，是應該列入家庭支出預算的第一項的。人究竟是爲了子女而生存的。至於學校當局方面也應經濟絕對公開，行政费用竭力節省，不過（對於敎學設備，如圖書儀器不可少於最低限度）對於敎俸比率應儘量增加。至一於敎員方面，在可以維持最低的家庭生活之外，不要有過奢的要求，生活力求嚴肅，敎學力求認眞，不要巧立名目收取學生任何額外的費用。這樣一般學生家長即使多擔負一點學費，總算不是落空的，還有一點，所謂敎員的最低生活費用，不可以開學時的生活爲依據，應該推算學期中途的生活指數以作標準。不過這樣的推算，頗感困難，因此我主張應依田賦徵收實物之例改收學米，大約高中七斗，初中六斗半，小學五斗，便可著爲定例。敎員薪水就以學米發給。這主張我知道不易得到多方面的贊同，但是我們實在想不出有甚麽可以反對的理由。</p>
<p>（四）學費增加後之補救辦法：現在據本人所知的幾十個比較優秀的學校，在下期學費規定了之後，未繳留額金的學生僅佔百分之二十，其中有十人是該領新申兩報助學金或因要轉學，就業，回鄉的，有十人確因經濟困難不能擔負學費。對於這百份率的學生，自然應由學校全免其學費。至於成績較差的學校，未定額學生有些佔百分之五十以上，這情形就比較嚴重（其中自然有一部份不是因爲擔負不起學費的綠故）此外還有志願入學的新生，因出不起學費，徬徨於校門之外的，這些都非另想辦法不可。我的對策有四。</p>
<p>（一）由當局嚴令學費超出褾準（須依生活指數重訂）各校，切實遵照功令增加免費及减費學生的名額，並須派員縝密調查。</p>
<p>（二）凡學費超過標準的學校，不得領受一切補助費或津貼費及食米配給。</p>
<p>（三）市府可將原定的私校行政津貼費總額，提出百分之三十至五十，增加市立學校的經費，指令市擴充學校額及班次，以容納失學學生。</p>
<p>（四）凡領受行政津貼費及其他補助費的學校，應重行規定其免費及减費學生名額。</p>
<p>最後我來槪括地說一下；（一）不要忽視一部份私校辦理成績優異的原因。（二）要調整學費必須在不妨碍「敎員生活的安定」的條件之下，加以考慮，敎員生活比較安定的學校，不要牽掣。（三）下期學費在二萬元以上而留額的學生已滿百分之八十的私校，似乎沒有必要再使他减費。（四）最近發表之私校學費標準，必須重行改訂。如超過此項重訂標凖收費的學校，则不予津貼及食米配給。（五）重訂學費的瞟準，必須以敎員家庭生活指數爲基準。（六）敎員家庭生活指數應依最近半年中生活指數上升率，推算學期中途的生活指數來決定。第一學期須推算四月份指數，第二學期須推算十一月份指數。（七）一部份私校學費採取自由規定制，一部份領受津貼及食米配給的私校，及全部市立學校，依新訂標準收費，且增加學額班次，如此則學生敎員功令三方面都可兼顧到了。</p>
<h3>對私立學校的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 張夢</p>
<p>據一位家長接到某私校當局的通吿，催繳留額金每生五百元，校役補助費四十元，寒假練習紙一百元，共計六百四十元。並規定下學期收費數目；高中二萬八千元，初中二萬六千元，二萬四千元，小學一萬六千元（包括書籍費在內），且限於舊曆年內一次繳淸。反視市立學校收費：高中二千四百元，初中一千八百元。小學高級一千六百元，中級一千四百元，低級一千二百元。市立與私立學費徵收比例，誠如天淵相隔。那末，這些私校規定的標準，不知是根據什麽的？</p>
<p>一家有五六個子女求學，是非常普遍的情形，要將子女送入市校求學，目前非常困難，送入私校，五六個子女須繳學費十餘萬元，家長按月二三萬元薪金，一方面要顧到家庭的開支，一方面要顧全子女的求學。事實上有所不能，祗有使子女失學。</p>
<p>惻隱之心，人皆有之，盼望市政當局嚴厲監督私校，實行日前公佈的學校收費標準。</p>
<h3>怎樣解決學費問題</h3>
<p>— 規夫</p>
<p>時光匆匆，學期又吿終了。由於物價的飛漲，下學期各校學費，也較上學期漲起數倍。風聞本市有一部私立學校，下學期收費，小學自一萬五千至二萬，初中自二萬至二萬五千，高中自二萬五千至三萬，大學在四萬以上。學費增加，雖在謀維持學校開支與敎師生活，另一方面却加重了家長負担，勢必使大批學生中途輟學。我們市民對如此嚴重的問題，不無憂慮，筆者不惴愚陋，謹擬數條具體辦法，實獻當局採納：</p>
<p>一、徵敎育稅　這個辦法，記得「國民論壇」上曾有人提議過，政府可興辦娛樂稅及各項消耗品奢侈品稅，或附微若干，以爲津貼。</p>
<p>二、增加配給　目前職業界的薪金，此較起來，最低微的莫如敎師。一個中學敎師的收人，祗堪維持其個人生活；至於小學敎師的收入，連個人生活亦難維持（即使照敎局規定經濟公開辦法的學校亦然）。幸而上學期敎育當局爲體念敎師生活淸苦，有特種戶口米的配給。個人生活，得以勉强維持過去。但這祗限於個人，若要養家活口，使之安心於本位工作，猶須對敎師的家屬，作同樣的配給。關於這個問題，本市戴敎育局長於去年底談話時特別關心，日前申報社評亦大聲呼籲，我們對此，寄以極大希望。</p>
<p>三、以商業盈餘補助敎育費　由經濟局飭令各業公會，按其所屬會員之多寡及其在商業地位上之大小，使負担相當比例之敎育經費，嗣後凡逢物價上漲，此項經費須與物價上漲之倍數同樣增加。</p>
<p>至於敎育局經濟局除負擔措該項經費之責外，並負監察支配之任，支配必須公允，對各校狀况，須有極詳細的調查，對敎師的薪金，亦應有合理規定，同時更須愼防弊端的發生。</p>
<p>綜上所述，雖非解救學費問題的澈底辦法，但祇要能實行一端，下學期的學費，至少可望暫時解決。莘莘學子，可無中途輟學之慮。唯是「揚湯止沸，不如釜底抽薪一。欲謀根本解決這問題，祗有從平抑物價着手。假使任物價上漲，那末學費即使便宜到如何程度，家長們恐亦無法負担，不得不令其子女做小販學徒甚至拾荒者了（這個現象目前已很普遍）「愛其國者，必愛其民。」希望當局對我們小民喁喁的期望，早　解決的辦法。</p>

<h3>必勝信念</h3>
<p>— 中國方面艦隊報道部鹽田大尉</p>
<p>自從新年更始以來，戰爭愈演愈烈了。菲律賓戰塲方面，也於本月九日敵美在呂宋島仁牙因灣登陸，充分表現出美國對菲律賓總反攻的姿態。固然敵美由於去年十月二十日雷伊泰鳬登陸，十二月二十五日明多羅島登陸，以及此次仁牙因灣登陸，而得以向本國民衆宣傳說，收復菲律賓之日可以預卜了。然而在我們看來，恰恰相反，敵美現在榮已深深陷入空前驚人的消耗戰的無底深坑裏了。美國雖然在去年十月牽灣以及菲律賓海戰上，遭受到毁滅性的致命打擎後，但仍然收拾全部殘餘艦隊，實行艦隊保全政策，向邱吉爾玩弄外交手腕，不容許英國艦隊坐大，以增加發言權，所以便要求英國艦隊派至東亞作戰。總之，敵美的目的，在於非一擊而突破日本內綫不可。敵美由於現在所處的國內不安形勢以及日暮途窮戰略，不得不在菲律賓支付莫大代價。如估計一下在菲律賓的龐大損失，則雷伊泰，明多羅，仁牙因三處登陸的成功，則決非美國之福。</p>
<p>菲島一帶戰事形勢</p>
<p>一大家都知道，在四千餘島連綿不斷所構成的菲律賓上登陸，是極輕而易舉的事，決不足令人驚異，更非日本軍無先見之明，而致有此次之失。這正如日本軍隊預先擺佈下的陣勢一樣，希望美國由仁牙因至麻尼刺的九十二英里上來攻，以便實行聚而殲之的戰術。</p>
<p>然而大家不要忽略，雷伊泰島上的日本軍隊，仍然完整無缺，所以在七十天內，曾拖住美國一百萬噸的船隻以及十數萬兵力，且殲滅了美國數萬大兵，而始終保護着布拉溫及參帕布羅兩個飛機塲。至於敵美爲佔領進攻呂宋的跳板，而兩師人馬在明多羅登陸，其所遭受的損失，也足够龐大。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞曾宣稱過，收復菲律賓需要二十萬大軍。由此點可以證明，總反攻將需要如何龐大的軍需物資，飛機以及彈藥等。然而按各方面的情報，可以斷定敵美不惜任何代價，不顧任何犧牲，將集中全力於菲島。單就兵力道一點說，目前固然業巳在菲島集中二十萬大軍，然而此等人力及物力，不斷遭受日軍的果敢襲擊，而受到莫大損失。尤其日不的航空部隊，全體都成爲敢死特別攻擊隊，向敵美艦船實行轟炸。甚至偵察機也帶着炸彈轟擊敵船。特殊潛航艇，則組成每人抱着一顆炸彈的游泳特別攻擊隊，向敵美運輸船面去。以上種種事實，全給與敵美以意外的極大消耗，致使敵美驚慌失措。</p>
<p>尼米資和麥克沃塞從澳洲，新幾內亞，荷蘭底亞等，偸過日本潛水艇及空軍的監視網，再經帛琉的烏爾西，運來的兵士及器材，到處受到日本軍隊肉彈的攻擊，往往一次毁滅八百人，或一千人，或一千五百人，這樣損失對於美國說，決不能算少。此輩特別攻擊隊，將與前此日俄戰爭時我們父輩或祖父一輩所作的二〇三高地肉彈破壞戰術，全都永垂靑史。</p>
<p>這樣莫大的消耗，一定會給與敵美最後決戰的戰鬥力上，以重大影響。由這一點也可以知道，焦急萬分的敵人，不斷實行戰術不允許的戰鬥，而向日軍內綫突進的理由。換言之，可以斷定，敵美建立數處橋頭堡以實行不健全的作戰，藉冒險以防止國內的不安現象。所以敵美在想努力在中國南部或在安南登陸，建立橋頭堡，以切斷日本與南洋的補充綫。敵人似乎是業已瞭解，無論是在菲島煞住，也無論是進而襲擊大睦，全將遭受極大的苦戰。這實在可以說，企圖消滅日本的敵美面前，已經展開了一條美國沒落的通路。敵人很知道，如果實行長期戰則只有內部士崩瓦解，自消自滅。敵人企圖向大陸進行無理作戰，按尼米資將軍派主力艦隊擾亂台灣以及菲律賓東方海面這一事實，亦可以猜想而知。再從物量上看，美國也佔絕對優勢，且陳腐不堪的英國破舊艦隊，也配合尼米資的攻勢，而繼續不斷地蠢動於蘇門答臘海面上，此外還有菲島作戰的美國第五第七艦隊，弗萊塞的英國艦隊，以及澳洲艦隊等，都在積極活動着。這樣足可以看出來敵人更進一步將在何處作戰。</p>
<p>敵美消耗無以爲繼</p>
<p>至於敵人將由何處派至中國大陸以大量睦上部隊，則美國苦於人力資源的枯竭，實在是敵人不可諱言的弱點。假如目前在拉蒙潛實行牽制作戰的敵美運輸船圖在拉蒙灣登陸，則結局必須從目前從事作戰的麥克沃塞軍中派出相當兵力。然而在呂宋島親身指揮作戰的麥克沃　，早已苦於兵力不足，怎還能有餘力分兵救人。日本軍隊在總指揮官山下大將與上海鐵血陸戰隊之父大河內海軍中將指導之下，不在仁牙因實行決戰，而想以逸待勞，輿敵決戰於阿克諾河南方的呂宋大平原上。縱令敵人有優勢空軍的不斷增援，但毫無疑問，敵人將有絕大人力與物力的損失。</p>
<p>數日前集結於新幾內亞的敵美驅逐艦三艘，滿戴着兵員，被颱風刮得不知去向，可以說，這是敵人不小的損失。縱令美國人口一億三千六百萬全爲美國人來計算，縱令可能動員的人數爲百分之五十，則現在早已超過百分之五十了。例如本月十一日陸軍部長史蒂姆生曾說過：「對日作戰，現在業已使用了預算以上的軍隊，但目前爲滿足前綫要求計，今後仍須在農塲，工塲以及政府機關內實行徵兵」。單就今年說，業已決定一月徵兵八萬，二月徵兵八萬，三月徵兵十萬，然而惟恐另外一方面的生產减少，於是便盡力使生產機械成爲自動式，以節省人力勞動。無論如何，人力消耗率過高，美國決無法應付。</p>
<p>至於物力方面，則因國內不安，而迫使戰爭指導者不得不採取短期作戰策略。今年的飛機生產，比去年反减少兩千架，這就是美國軍隊急於遠來菲島以及東部太平洋覓尋決戰之機的原因。然而敵美遭受日軍在台菲海空戰上所給與的物資消耗打擊尙未恢復之際，決不會建立起來有利的戰術。</p>
<p>神出鬼沒的日艦隊</p>
<p>日本海軍聯合艦隊，當然會不容許尼米資艦隊侵入台灣，安南，南中國海，或菲律賓等地的，就是在菲島海戰日本砲轟下僅以身免的第三艦隊哈爾靈，此次也決不會逃出日本的砲擊。</p>
<p>正如四十年前日本海內停留的日本聯合艦隊一樣，表面看來似乎是在採取防禦作戰形式，但戰機一熟，則立刻採取進攻作戰。大日本帝國海軍的優秀傳統，始終都是進攻的，只要機會一到，則立刻出擊，毫不猶預，那時總會消滅美澳聯合艦隊，取得勝利的。弗萊塞英國艦隊，還將複演一會菲律賓海戰慘敗的一幕悲劇。</p>
<p>去年十月，日本聯合艦隊在菲律賓東方獲得了赫赫戰果後，便又神出鬼沒，不可捉摸，致使敵美神經痛苦。在這個期間，日本補充損失的飛機，努力準備大砲和魚雷，養精蓄銳，以待時機。再談到我們日本海軍兵士，則努力對艱苦作戰中的菲島日軍擔任補充任務，或進行交通綫保護作戰，或打擊蠶動於南中國海的敵美潛水艇以及飛機的活動，而進行最艱苦的運輸補充。</p>
<p>所謂消耗戰，，即補充戰，就是決定菲島勝敗的唯一因素，就是決定大東亞勝敗的唯一因素。因此，帝國海軍的作戰，是極爲重要的，而日本駐華艦隊，也是在日夜進行着這同樣重要任務的。日本駐華艦隊和其他許多艦隊一同，全以聯合艦隊爲中心，而在浩浩無垠的太平洋海面上，向擊潰敵美的康莊大道前進。然而目前的決戰塲，業已轉移到菲律賓島上，同時敵美即想更進一步以中國大陸爲戰塲，暴露其野心，於是我日本駐華艦隊的使命，將隨而提高。</p>
<p>向着勝利大道邁進</p>
<p>我們日本軍民，完全團結一致，在菲島海面上以及陸地上，處處與敵美以致命打擊，消耗其人力與物力，在大東亞戰爭的禾來勝利上，自然打下了鞏固的基礎。前面已經講過，決戰是極大的消耗戰，同時決戰是連續的戰爭。對於這種連續決戰，現在比任何時候都需要澈底的勝利制度。</p>
<p>一個就是增加生產。數日前一個報道班員對於菲島決戰的報吿中，曾說過一句：「敵美在空軍兵力上握有有利的地位」。但仁牙因前綫上的日本軍將士，親眼　見敵美的運輸船隊，按空軍部隊的偵察，敵美艦艇運輸船因然料不足而停止航駛。所以我們可以想像到，日本將土在熱烈盼　着空軍補充。老實說，空軍兵力的補充，就是當前最重要的課題之一。</p>
<p>第二個就是昻揚敢鬥精神。我們每一個日本人，固然在心板上都鏤刻着必勝信念。但尼米資比任何人都堅決主張，侵入菲島及東部太平洋，最後在中國大陸上建立起立脚點。至於麥克沃塞，則曾在三年期間內天天大吹大擂地說收復菲律賓。同時美國政府因國內的無辦法，當然今後即將如江河之決堤，一瀉千里，而展開謀略宣傳和思想宣傳。大陸作戰中陷於茍延殘喘的重慶政權，定會乘此機會，展開空中轟炸，而向和平地區進行猛烈宣傳工作。同時，等候此種機會已久的中國共產黨，爲了擴大其地盤。一定會在上海展開拿手好戲——宣傳工作，這還都是意想中事。我們日本人處於這樣思想混亂中的上海，如以迄然不動的必勝信念應付萬變的現象，則上海的混亂思想可廓然一淸，這是容易取得的。所以每一個人都必須以「戰爭不達勝利不止」的思想爲自已的唯一信念</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，固然是絕大的消耗戰，然而爭取戰爭勝利，則操於國民堅持到底的意志上。所以不要因戰局的一時變化，忽憂忽喜，應當少說話多作事，默默各自守護着自已的職業临位，無論遭受任何艱苦的條件，如能貫澈始終，堅持自已的工作，則我敢斷言，敵美艦隊和登陸軍，一定會葬身魚腹，片甲不歸。（一月十五日）</p>
<p>呂宋島戰事形勢圖</p>
<p>呂宋島戰事現正以仁牙因灣爲中心，沿五十公哩之狹長戰綫展開激戰。敵軍在仁牙因市附近阿古諾河沿岸，遭日軍猛攻。日軍有力挺進部隊並突入聖決比安附近敵軍陣地，收獲莫大戰果。</p>

<h3>烟雲</h3>
<p>— 林莽</p>
<p>黄澄澄的夕光裏，風在樹尖颯颯低語。陰影下，一垜頹圯的垣牆。牆上，掛着長春籘，滿是靑苔和水漬。正中，喏大的「福」字，依稀還能辨認昔日塗上的朱砂，彷彿一隻倦眼，瞪着蹲在對面的空的府第。門前階傍，衛護着一對石獅子。從它岸梧的身幹上，我們可推知這府第過去的繁華的夢。它圓睜着兩限，——是否在懊海：沒有挽住往昔的歲月。抑或是惱怒：有時一掠風過，使它馱上一層不潔的街灰？</p>
<p>空的府第，敞着門；門上斑剝的漆，訴盡了人間的滄桑。朱椽，華檻，有的早已拆散，有的歪斜的留着，——讓風雨和蠢來浸蝕它的回憶吧。——宛如老年人的拐杖，勉力支持那垂暮的軀壳。庭院裏，滋生的衰草使曲徑隱去，業生的葛爬藤裏有多少促織在忙碌呢。荷花池也甕塞了——據說，在已往榮華的年月裏，有個丫環受盡主人的鞭笞，就偸偸的跳了下去。可是至今，任憎惡也罷，愛慕也罷，都給斷梗殘葉掩蓋去了。屋脊上，遍生「瓦花」。凌亂的瓦片，蔽去了貧瘠的屋架。有說是風雨的痕跡，有說是給爬上去捉鳥蛋的頑童踏碎的。其實，能埋怨　呢？反正它是蒼老了。</p>
<p>以前，誰曾不羨慕門前的車馬和儀仗。過路的人也都駐足而觀這座輝煌的府第，傾聽門內的喧嘩。當那般愛　鬧熱的人結集在門口時，就給門客的一聲叱喝趕散了。被趕的人除掉太息之外，能有甚麽呢？一回去，就敎誨自己的子孫，把這裏的榮華，比作他們此後當努力的楷模。</p>
<p>可是，誰曾澈悟盛衰的至理，知道這府第也有敗落的地步呢？現在，那般叱喝的人那里去了？也許和時常在這門內做座上客的一樣，散了，走遠了。</p>
<p>只留下那個老蒼頭，蜷伏在這府第的角落里，看盡世事的滄桑。他是這樣的老了：一鬢白髮，滿臉皺紋，缺齒，說話時嗤嗤的漏着風。佝僂的身幹，蹣跚着脚步，他珍惜過去的夢，還保持着舊有的衣冠。可是也和這府第一樣，　　了。</p>
<p>垂暮時，有旅客走過，跟蹌着脚步，表示他跋涉過不少的路。他徘徊在這府第的門首，嘆息不止。</p>
<p>由於此，引起老蒼頭深深的驚訝。他反剪着手，跨下石階，對旅客瞟了一眼。（他還沒有忘記以前的氣派呢。）</p>
<p>「客人，你認識我家的主人麽？」</p>
<p>「不。」他沉默了一會：「可是，由於我們沒有多少差異的命運，也許不會陌生。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你一定碰着過我家的小主人。」</p>
<p>「沒有哪。我也問你，你家的小主人可曾碰着我嗎？這樣大的世界，誰會碰着誰呢？」</p>
<p>老蒼頭給這些奇怪的言語難住了。</p>
<p>旅客在院落里巡行一番，嘆息着。</p>
<p>「老蒼頭，你在這里期待些甚麼呵。」</p>
<p>那個啞然失笑，搖了一陣頭：「你以爲我會離開這宅子麽？我半把年紀活在這里，你想：我會像垃圾一樣拋掉它麽？會像那般以前喝在這里，穿在這里的人一樣走遠去麽？」</p>
<p>旅客沉默着。</p>
<p>「那麼，你們的小主人呢？」</p>
<p>「你還提起他麽？那個浪蕩子，不會理財的傢伙，他早遠去了。祖宗的遺　，他當是缸裏的水呢。一盆盆潑完了，就走了。永遠不曾回來過。不過，說也可憐，在外面，吃的穿的誰給他留心？他是金枝玉葉的少爺喔。」</p>
<p>旅客若有所思：「假使，他不幸在路上死了呢？」</p>
<p>老蒼頭呆了一下。陡地，堅決的說：「不會嗯。他祖上積過厚德，不會有這樣命運的。」</p>
<p>他唏噓着。</p>
<p>「客人，你知道我家生人的身世嗎？」</p>
<p>「他不是從祖上接受了很多錢財麼？他有煊赫的職位，也善於理財。那時，這府第門前面，不是阻塞着一大隊的車馬和儀仗麼？他不是豢養過很多的人，給他們住和喝麼？可是，他有一個不肖的兒子，在他死後，把錢財都散盡了。於是，他就離去這蒼凉的地方，給他很多記憶的地方，一直遠去了。」</p>
<p>老人訝然失聲，「你怎麼知道呢？」</p>
<p>「我也有過這樣的如雲烟的日子喱。」</p>
<p>「還有哪。」老人低下了頭，似乎浸沉在者日的　夢裏。</p>
<p>「可是，我疲倦了。」</p>
<p>旅客跨下石階，揮揮身上的灰土。夕尖投在他身上，地上留下伶仃的影子。他跟蹌的走了。</p>
<p>老人望着他寂寞的身影，靜靜的凝思。</p>
<p>一掠風過，街上揚起塵土，灰濛濛的。有幾片落葉，在地上唦吵的滾。是否也感於這人世的凋零呢？</p>
<h3>女演員</h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>早晨，話劇女演員郭英醒來時，聽見輕輕的敲門聲，她却又闔上了眼不理會。她還怕那人敲得不耐煩時，會闖進來。那人可能是個小報影劇版的記者，或許是個「劇評家」——不管他是誰，總之等他纏上了你，這一上午就難過，那類似情話的諛詞謂個不完，問你要這，要那……可眞够受的。</p>
<p>但是，那人輕輕地敲着，並沒闖進萊。</p>
<p>「郭小姐，」那是房東家老媽媽的聲音：「一個老頭兒要見你。」</p>
<p>「說我沒醒！」</p>
<p>「不行，小姐，老頭兒說非見你不可，有要事。</p>
<p>一個老頭兒有要事，怪事。她想着回答道；</p>
<p>「請他等一等，我還沒起身呢！慢慢地，喂！他有什麽要事？」</p>
<p>『不肯說，那老頭兒說不親自見你，講不明白。」</p>
<p>女演員坐在窗前桌旁，拆看昨天收到的信札，一封是某大雜誌編者寄來的，請她寫點關於最近「北上」的文章，還有一封是個劇迷寫來的，這封費去九牛二虎之力寫成的信是這樣開始的：——</p>
<p>「我認爲做女演員是世界上最高尙，最光榮……的職業」，接着描寫一通郭小姐的美麗。最後是約她今日下午吃咖啡。</p>
<p>女演員笑着看完這封信，數了數那人一共用了二十一個驚嘆號。</p>
<p>「吳雲飛」？！她唸着那人的大名，地記起前幾天，在泰山路一家公司裏遇見的一個小職員，吳雲飛就是這個小職員，那一天，他招待我們郭小姐眞够殷動——說實話，他憑什末不該興奮呢？不該殷勤呢？你想，在他這一生裏有比這事情再重大的事嗎？郭小姐買了東西，他死不肯收錢，他又問她要簽名照，並且要她這末寫：</p>
<p>「送給吳雲飛」，女演員想到這裏，她把那封用了二十一個驚嘆號的信撕得粉碎，拋在字紙簍裏，這正是本文開頭時，老媽媽通報過的那個老頭兒氣勢汹汹地走入室內的時候。</p>
<p>這屋子裏只有你一人住？」他望望室內的佈置，問道：</p>
<p>「兩個人住，」女演員回答，然而她立刻就譽得不該這樣回答，爲什末不反問：「你問這幹嗎？」或者簡直攆他出去。一個陌生人初見面就問女演員這句話，太輕視對方的身份了。</p>
<p>然而，那人逕自坐下來他似乎有點喪失了理性，實在說，這樣粗鹵的舉止和他所受的敎餋不配，讀下文，你就會知道他是一個有敎養的人。</p>
<p>「郭小姐！現在我祗有一綫生路，請你把這間房子出頂了！或許……」</p>
<p>「老先生，我不懂你的意思。」女演員說：「而且，首光這間房子不屬於我。」</p>
<p>「我知道，現在我祗徵求你的同意，至於他，他敢反對？」</p>
<p>「這呌我更不明白，」女演員說，又自言自語：『她（郭英指的是跟她住在一起的演員）不敢反對？」</p>
<p>老頭兒驀地跳起來：「你這個狐狸精！你裝白痴，現在我都明白了，你說，這次從北平回來，誰給你這間房子？他給你買了幾件大衣？這末多錢，不這末化會到那裏去呢」？</p>
<p>女演員哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>「你存心拆我的家，」老頭兒激動得像隻公雞；「我們世代書香要敗在你的手裏！玩女戲子，玩女戲子會有好結果？我們吳家淸白世家，那個不知？我寫得一手好字，那個不稱讀？（這裏，郭英又大笑起來，她知道，有種人最怕人家不知道他的特長），就說雲飛這孩子他不是一直很規矩嗎？……」</p>
<p>你說吳雲飛，他是你的孩子嗎？」女演員打量着這不幸的老頭兒，慼到說不出的悲哀，她已經明白了悲劇的一半。</p>
<p>他不是一直很規矩嗎？」老頭兒接下去：「可是，他最近會突然用虧了十幾萬，這許多錢不全化在你身上？」</p>
<p>「老先生，你先靜一下，我要向你解釋，你兒子，吳雲飛，我有點認職……」</p>
<p>有點認識？你又賴！」</p>
<p>「我實在祗跟他見過一面，最後她說「至於和他同居等等都是無稽之談，他這十幾萬錢取許是賭輸了，或者化在舞女身上，我可以人格担保，我們話劇演員決不會不淸不白化別人的錢，也從來沒想到要化別人的錢。」</p>
<p>「女戲子，會有人格？我不信你的話，你們不化別人的錢，化能的錢？」老頭兒又激動起來：「我親目在他身上查出你的相片，他公司裏的人也都這末說他常和你來往……」</p>
<p>「老先生，你不懷疑，這都是你兒子胡謅的嗎？至於那張簽名照……」于是她又把實事重說一遍</p>
<p>「老先生，我也要對你兒子不客氣！」女演員拉長了臉：「來我們一起去找他，我要他賠償名譽上的損失，我們女演員不是好欺侮的！」</p>
<p>「郭小姐，你別火……」老頭巴結地說道：「有話好講，我也不過向你商量，商量，房子頂不頂全由你主。」</p>
<p>「房間根本不是屬於我的，我早就對你說過我們兩個人住，」她笑起來「不過那人不是你的兒子，你別誤會，」又突然厲聲地說：「我不能任別人在外而敗壞名譽，我要辦他！」</p>
<p>「小姐，有話好講」老頭兒說：「他並沒有敗壞你的名譽呀！你別氣，這都是我老的糊塗，我沒問他淸楚，你知道，我這兩天的日子多難過，教腦子完全昏啦，這十幾萬就是把我老骨頭打斷，傾家湯產，也是還不出的……昨晚，我在他抽屜裏，不是他身上，打我嘴巴子！——找出你的相片，我就想這錢準是化在你身上，——打我嘴巴子——我的女兒對我說，你才從北平回來，這十幾萬錢大概是給你頂房子了，我想這話有理，而且以爲有了轉機，因爲把這房子頂了，不就能還償這些錢嗎？我沒讓雲飛知道，我今兒一早來看你，我這老糊塗……」他哭着，躬着腰走出去了。</p>
<p>女演員無言佇立，她想起前幾天在泰山路那家公司過見的小職員，又想起那封用二十一個驚嘆號寫成的信，今日下午二時我在弟弟斯等着你……」哈哈，好不糊塗。</p>
<p>「女演員是世界上最高尙……的職業！」她重複着這句話，咬緊了牙關</p>
<h3>洗衣女</h3>
<p>— 西芸</p>
<p>寒意上林梢，庭園已寂寥，惟有古井邊，洗衣女正辛勞。撩起袖，彎了腰。一回用刷一回皂；努力欲把汚垢消。</p>
<p>細細搓，搓起了皂沫堆如雪。更不厭淸水裏幾回滌</p>
<p>晾向日光中，看—紗巾潔白如新，臂衫與碧天爭凈！洗衣女，微笑着，悄將紅腫雙手間：「可能將世間洗去點點汚痕？』</p>

<h3>三屆上海籃球聯賽展幕　對各隊之希望</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球結束伊始，第三屆上海籃球聯賽接踵而起，以滬上籃球隊之蓬勃，提倡者之有心，以故甲乙女組加入者甚盛，實籃球界之好現象也。現該聯賽巳於本週先開始甲組及女組比賽，俟此次比賽完畢後再舉行乙組賽，此再興趣方面，完全集中於一時，殆將造成先盛後衰必然之現象，當局之所以作如是措置者，亦必爲集中精力之一道，豈可厚非。更悉此次分租爲甲甲組，甲乙組，乙組，女組，四組；甲甲組五隊，女組組隊，甲乙組及乙組對伍較多。前兩組並取雙循環制，旣使球迷多的欣賞好球之機會，復興本身之收入有英大利益。進一步言，亦可謂好球隊多一比賽，確可提高水準，一舉而數得，筆者不能不向本屆聯賽致莫大之欽仰焉。</p>
<p>致所加入之隊伍，甲組及女組與申報盃各隊大同小異。茲乘此展幕之初，不妨對甲組及女組各雄師加以檢討及希望。至甲乙組及乙組則俟有機時再談。</p>
<h3>甲甲組　滬上五强</h3>
<p>此次編爲甲甲組者。以華南對之星散，僅五隊而巳。曰中北，華聯，汪隊，仁餘，及甲申。上列各隊，可稱蒐集滬上第一流選手殆盡，甲甲隊名養尙屬陌生而隊員及其作風，亦固爲一般人所共知。子對各隊之希望，謹述於下：</p>
<p>中北　在申報盃中敗於汕隊之後，幾使英名掃盡，待克服華聯隊，其北派之優點，又　迴球迷腦際，耐人尋味。按筆者在此對該隊各個隊員之個人技術與夫經騐，無可再作改進。唯其作戰之方略，及各隊員之氣力，確有更進之必要，覲乎與甲　之戰，對於上述二點，巳漸更見正以上二點，其素來作戰似無忠心策略，今巳確定用人釘人制。各隊員之長力，亦漸見平均進展。又悉華影包松圓現亦投效該隊實力大增，則如能努力以往，中北之演出，將非我人所可想像而得。</p>
<p>華聯　對華聯隊之各方面，筆者均表示悅意。其練習之精神，與夫硏究戰術，尤爲可貴。最近情形，其陣容大有更動之可能。蓋阿孔與錫麟，俱見身體發胖，奔馳方面，吃虧殊多。最可能者，當以慶公及勃脫試後衛，前鋒則有阿弟顯崙良雄菊生等，仍極見楚楚。總之該隊人材濟濟，調度自易，益以張桂祥嚴又陵之智足多謀，登峯造極，意料中事。</p>
<p>汕隊　我愛其隊喜合作，我之其隊員之勇敢，具此二美，庶幾以一新興隊伍，爾能有此收穫。致其不足者，當仍不失爲經騐不够，易起反當之表演，而無固定中應得之成績。此不足怪，亦無可再短時間謀改正，固亦過程中必有之事，稍假時日，自可循軌而前。汕隊之前途，豈可限量所望者，羣策羣力，始終不渝耳。</p>
<p>仁餘　爲一有歷史之球隊，其成績乃因隊員之來去而變換。唯該隊無論在任何情形之下，總能儘量發揮特長，及運動道德。此番加入聯賽，當不斤斤于勝負，以提滬新人爲主。更爲可嘉，與華聯之役，各小將不負眾望，可見其平時能再正當狀態中苦練，始能有此表演。筆者對該隊之精神，實抱最大之敬仰，豈僅視其戰績而巳。</p>
<p>甲申　該隊組織伊始，斷難有望超然之成績。况隊員俱屬來自數隊，合作未能在短時間上默契「將憑各個之本領，各個發展。故戰中北時，「亦能靠各個而有優良之局面。微聞該隊當局興趣甚高，邇來每日練習，則或有刮目相視之一日。</p>
<h3>六路巾幗　各有特長</h3>
<p>聯誼　係聯誼體育會下之新產，乃以嶄新之姿態演出，但以新軍成立，戰績尙雖期理想，故諸巾幗應不以敗而怠懈，勇往直前，我保險聯誼女子籃球隊之可有前程。</p>
<p>華僑　在上屆籃球聯賽後，息影迄今，大部人馬依然。查該隊隊員，身體健康，姿勢優美，俱爲各隊所不及。此番自未必有超然之演出，而以其體格姿勢而言，予我人愜意之記載，甚望該隊於此方面，在多發揮。</p>
<p>雪白　不論其前鋒及後衛與戰術三者，均有平均進展之佳境，唯以個人技術之未臻純熟，輒易造成犯規。若能特別留意此點，則所得所穫，決可超乎一般人所想像者。</p>
<p>益康　該隊不失爲一有敎練之隊伍，能循規蹈矩，逐漸進步。所覺缺憾者，似嫌過於方式化。夫應用方式，必須力求隨機應變，庶幾能收事半功倍之效。質之該隊敎練，以爲如何？</p>
<p>三省　因有張　樂嘉實等新人之卯上，以故該隊戰績，並不稍弱於以往。一致認爲不足者，聯絡默契，俱未見做到。尤以後衛方面，徒勇無謀。設能好事改善，觀乎其隊員魁梧之體格，其成功自在意料之中。</p>
<p>綠隊　該隊大有目下滬上無敵手之氣槪。此點足以證明滬上女籃之情况雖熱烈，水準實尙低。職斯之故，綠隊從不能逢一稍爲足以相對之隊，與之競爭。究之，綠隊在現况下痛擊各隊，應無異疑。而該隊之缺點，爲後備人員能力不足。如能精益求精，則不失爲盟主之稱，異日出征遠地，以顯滬上巾幗之威風，有利賴焉。</p>
<p>女組方面，綠隊似仍可蟬聯冠軍，其餘五隊，實力均在伯仲之間，且有雙循環之良機，大動干戈，各大相讓，一番鶯聲空氣，自可增添不少生色。</p>
<h3>中西拳擊錦標賽　今晨舉行</h3>
<p>喧傳了好久的中西拳擊錦標大賽，定於今晨（二十一日）十時三刻，在回力球塲舉行。時間改遲的唯一原因，就爲了今天足球比賽，恐怕雙方時間衝突，特地改遲了三刻鐘。好讓球迷　了球賽再有機會來欣賞這本年第一次舉行的盛大拳賽。</p>
<p>拳賽的陣容，經過縝密的遴選與醫師全身的檢查後，正式發表於後：</p>
<p>十四合：凱達坦地戰山姆劉古（每合三分鐘）</p>
<p>八回合：但利杜尼戰溫諾古（每合二分鐘）</p>
<p>八回合：羅根斯坦戰賽維索夫</p>
<p>六回合：　培根戰維多</p>
<p>六回合：格洛皮夫戰石維亞</p>
<p>六回合：小莫戰亞爾石菲</p>
<p>四回合：林忠手戰香海</p>
<p>據一般老於拳事得拳迷觀察：坦地的拳法精通，有初七的襲擊，兇猛的衝擈。加着冷静的頭腦，似乎這塲拳戰，他是接着必胜之劵。可是山姆劉古，也不是弱者。他從底層實幹，一直打倒最高級。實力，機智與勇敢；同樣具着無比的威力。所以，坦地的前途也不容樂觀。但利杜尼是意大利有名虎將，對抗德僑溫諾古，眞是龍虎相爭，必有一番非常的惡鬥。最値得一提的是：國人李培格的勤奮。他每天早晨，從不遲到後早到，扣足時間，練習一個半小時。像他這種苦幹的精神，在拳人圈中是很少見的。</p>
<p>據李培根對人家聲稱：這次的拳鬥，他抱定決心，議定要把西僑打倒，替國人增加光榮的聲譽。他有這種志氣與毅力，一定能够成功，達到他所希冀的目標。在有一位林忠孚，也是一個靑年有爲德少壯派。他對於對手方香海的體力推測，有必勝的把握。希望他倆今天同事獲取最後勝利！（佩）</p>

<h3>Fierce Attack by Elite Japanese Troops Near Manao, Luzon; Enemy Attempt to Advance South from Lingayen Gulf Foiled</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf attempted to advance south along the highway leading to Manila. Elite Japanese troops launched a fierce attack near Manao, killing 200 enemy soldiers and destroying three tanks on the 17th. On the 18th, they continued to intercept enemy reinforcements, setting four tanks ablaze and driving them back. Japanese units in northern Luzon have also been continuously sending raiding parties deep into enemy positions, completely destroying the enemy's main forward bases. As a result, the enemy has been forced to transfer troops landed north of Lingayen, in areas such as Santo Tomas, to reinforce the southern flank. Furthermore, since the 18th, the enemy has repeatedly used B-24 and P-38 type bombers from base air forces to cover the troops landing in Lingayen Gulf, while also intensifying reconnaissance over southern Luzon, revealing an intention to take advantage of the decisive battle in Luzon and attempt to move further from the Lingayen Gulf area to other locations.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Associated Press report from the Luzon front: In the past 24 hours, fierce tank battles have unfolded on the highway between Lingayen Gulf and Manila. Two Japanese soldiers carrying bombs destroyed American tanks, causing extreme shock among American soldiers.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – From the night of the 18th to the morning of the 19th, Japanese air forces twice heavily bombed the enemy positions near the coast of the Camotes Islands, shattering several enemy fortifications.</p>
<p>Japanese War Results Expanding</p>
<p>Lingayen Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf, under the cover of intense artillery fire and bombing, are gradually attempting to move south. Since the 16th, they have faced fierce Japanese attacks and counterattacks, and their anxious advance has been thwarted. Elite Japanese troops waiting for action launched a powerful attack on the enemy's main bridgehead line towards San Fabian on the night of the 16th, penetrating deep into enemy positions. Simultaneously, a unit carried out an amphibious landing on the coast, attacking the enemy from the rear, and burning and destroying enemy ammunition, tanks, and vehicles piled up on the coastal highway and in civilian houses, throwing the enemy lines into great chaos. At the same time, Japanese artillery also fired intensely, and Japanese air forces dropped bombs like rain, with combined air and land attacks greatly startling the enemy forces on the Lingayen Gulf coast. On the morning of the 17th, black smoke billowed from Japanese positions near the coast and the San Fabian enemy positions, with extremely tragic sounds of fuel explosions. The unit led by Lieutenant Sato, which broke through enemy lines and returned to their positions, destroyed four enemy M4 tanks, forty automatic cannons, and eight vehicles. Other main forces destroyed and burned countless enemy ammunition depots and warehouses, and the war results continue to expand.</p>
<h3>Overall Situation in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The situation in the Philippines is as follows: After the enemy American forces established a bridgehead at Lingayen Gulf, they gradually shifted to mobile warfare. The main force of the enemy landing forces, consisting of four divisions, including a tank division, advanced from the northeast coast of Lingayen Gulf through Mount Cabaruan. The Japanese first-line units and enemy forces north of San Fabian, who were using the undulating plateau terrain extending southward to construct fortifications, were suddenly subjected to Japanese counterattacks and acted extremely passively. In the Damortis area, enemy forces near the coastline around San Fabian and Aringay have constructed fortifications along a line approximately four kilometers long, preparing for battle. South of San Fabian, the enemy offensive is very active. Another enemy force has invaded near Biti, six kilometers east of San Fabian, at the Japanese first-line positions. Currently, Japanese forces are intercepting this enemy force in front of the first-line positions and in the area between the first and second lines. The enemy force facing the Japanese right-wing positions in the highlands west of Lingayen is moving extremely slowly. At Lingayen Airfield, the enemy began to use a small number of small aircraft around the 15th. The enemy is also advancing south from Lingayen and Dagupan into the Pangasinan Plain, gradually reaching the Agno River area. A portion of the enemy has crossed the river and is attacking the south bank area. Japanese forces north of San Fabian have been intensifying their charges since the night of the 16th, greatly shocking the enemy. The results of the night battles on the 16th were announced by Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 19th, and the enemy's subsequent losses were even greater. Japanese forces in the highlands west of Lingayen have also launched courageous charges, hindering the enemy's use of Lingayen Airfield and achieving significant results. The Japanese air force, fully aware of the enemy's ambition to invade Luzon, quickly converted all aircraft into special attack units since the enemy approached the coast of Lingayen, heavily bombing enemy warships. They are now inflicting heavy damage on enemy supply convoys. There have been no major changes in the Leyte and Mindoro areas, and Japanese forces are still intercepting the enemy. Furthermore, the enemy mobile task force, primarily the 38th Task Force, later intruded into the South China Sea and attacked Taiwan, the southern coast of China (Guangzhou, Hong Kong), and the Hainan Island area on the 12th, 15th, and 16th, respectively. It appears to still be patrolling the sea northwest of Luzon.</p>
<h3>Enemy Positions Blasted Across From Thabeikkyin</h3>
<p>Burma Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 18th, Japanese air forces heavily bombed enemy positions across the Irrawaddy River from Thabeikkyin, about 70 kilometers directly north of Mandalay, destroying three surface installations. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base. Furthermore, one hundred enemy P-47 aircraft attacked the Meiktila area in central Burma on the 16th. Japanese air forces intercepted them, shooting down two and destroying one.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Sunk in Luzon Waters Total 121</h3>
<p>—War Results of Japanese Air Force and Naval Units—</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air forces and naval units have repeatedly attacked enemy warships in the waters around Luzon Island, inflicting heavy damage during the enemy's landing in Lingayen Gulf. The combined war results achieved by Japanese forces from the 3rd to the 12th of this month are as follows: eight enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship, twelve other warships, and seventy-seven transport ships were sunk. One enemy aircraft carrier, battleships and other warships, and fourteen transport ships were damaged and set on fire. That is, in addition to sinking and destroying nine enemy aircraft carriers, twenty-one enemy warships, including battleships, and ninety-one transport ships were sunk and destroyed, totaling one hundred twenty-one enemy warships sunk and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers and House of Representatives to Hold Plenary Sessions Today; Foreign Minister to Deliver Policy Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese House of Peers and House of Representatives will reconvene on the 21st. The schedule is as follows: The House of Peers will hold a plenary session at 10:00 AM, where Prime Minister Koiso and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will deliver policy speeches. From 9:50 AM, each standing committee will convene to elect chairmen and vice-chairmen.

Nakajima Yadanji will ask questions on military production, labor transport, and financial issues. Finally, Kimura Masayoshi will ask questions on ensuring national livelihood, increasing food production, and air defense issues.</p>
<p>Essentials of Timely Measures for National Mobilization in Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government, in the fourth item of the five major emergency measures, advocated strengthening the work ethic and comprehensive national labor mobilization. Recently, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare as the central focus, concrete measures have been formulated. The General Mobilization Deliberation Council decided on the "Essentials of Timely Measures for National Mobilization" on the 10th. According to the purpose of these essentials, the goal is to promote the rapid progress of military mobilization and labor mobilization and to enable the effective functioning of emergency measures under air raids, thereby maximizing the full potential of national labor. Therefore, it can also be considered a law delegating full powers of mobilization or a "fundamental law of mobilization." Its main contents include ensuring the necessary personnel and employment, rationalizing mobilization preparations, organizing mobilization methods, legalizing functional allocation, and improving mobilization administration.</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Tax Revenue to Supplement Temporary Expenses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government, in response to the increasing war expenditure, decided to implement a tax increase plan of approximately 1.8 billion yen annually from fiscal year 1945. At the same time, sixteen amendment bills including the Income Tax Law were submitted to the current Diet session. Furthermore, in order to increase the above-mentioned tax revenue and monopoly fund revenue, it was also decided to increase cigarette prices. Finance Minister Ishiwata submitted a draft proposal at the cabinet meeting on the 16th, requesting the understanding of each cabinet member. On the afternoon of the 19th at 3:00 PM, the Finance Minister officially announced that the increased revenue for fiscal year 1945 would be over 690 million yen. Combined with the previous two revenue increases, it has reached an unprecedentedly large amount. Due to this tax increase and the increased revenue from monopoly profits, the national treasury revenue has reached a huge sum of 2.5 billion yen. The increased revenue from this price increase will be entirely used for the special account for temporary military expenses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Osaka-Kobe Area Damaged 23</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately eighty enemy B-29 aircraft attacked the industrial zone in the Osaka-Kobe area of Japan on the afternoon of the 19th. After Japanese forces intercepted them and investigated the results, about one-third, or twenty-three, of them were damaged. Several of them have been confirmed shot down. Three Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately eighty B-29 aircraft from Mariana bases invaded the Osaka-Kobe area from the direction of the Kii Peninsula in several waves from 1:48 PM on the 19th, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs. By about 2:30 PM, they retreated to the sea in the south. This was the first time that the enemy attacked the Osaka-Kobe area with a strong formation. The enemy's intention was to destroy Japan's supply sources and focus on destroying aviation production facilities. However, due to the brave interception by Japanese air defense units and the solidity of the ground defense lines, the damage was minimal. The results of the interception battle by the Japanese air defense units are currently under investigation. Recently, the enemy has attacked Nagoya, Shizuoka Prefecture, and the Kanto region with a small number of aircraft, dropping bombs near Okazaki, but the damage to Japan has been very minor.</p>
<h3>Bombing of Macau; Portuguese Consul's Remarks</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Portuguese Vice-Consul in Guangzhou, Agnelo de Queiroz, made a statement on the afternoon of the 18th regarding the bombing of Macau, stating: "Because the government of Macau has not yet released any official statement, I do not know the full details of the bombing, which is regrettable. However, since American planes have bombed Macau three times, it is definitely not a case of mistaken targets. Furthermore, the vast majority of Chinese residents in Macau are extremely angered by the atrocities of the American planes."</p>
<p>Weekly Review</p>
<h3>Standards for Tuition Collection and the Issue of Teacher Salary Distribution</h3>
<p>— Zeng Niwei</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Education Bureau promulgated the regulations on the standards for collecting student fees from private primary and secondary schools on the 9th of this month, setting the high school tuition fee at 7,500 yuan, junior high at 6,000 yuan, senior elementary at 4,000 yuan, intermediate at 3,600 yuan, and junior at 3,200 yuan, it is said that some private primary and secondary schools have repeatedly held meetings to discuss this and once sent representatives to discuss directly with the Municipal Education authorities, requesting consideration of the difficulties in the lives of teachers and staff, and making reasonable adjustments to the already promulgated standards for collecting tuition fees. However, the authorities believe that if tuition fees follow the general price increases and are arbitrarily raised, it will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in the number of students dropping out of school. Therefore, they expressed the hope that the education community in the city will assist the authorities in promoting methods to rescue dropouts with the spirit of "education for education," and that they do not intend to consider further adjustments to the already promulgated tuition fee standards.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, what is the response of the various private primary and secondary schools? According to surveys, it is divided into two attitudes: one is "going their own way," and the other is "waiting and seeing." Regardless of how we evaluate these attitudes, it is a serious problem worthy of attention by those who care about the future of education, and it cannot be denied.</p>
<p>It is very clear that the core of this problem lies in whether the standards for tuition collection take into account the burden on students' parents and the livelihood of teachers and staff who rely on tuition revenue to support their lives. If the standards for tuition collection can take both of these aspects into account, then the private primary and secondary schools should not arbitrarily raise tuition fees under the pretext of being unable to maintain the lives of teachers and staff, disregarding the sharp increase in the number of students dropping out of school due to their high tuition fees. The education authorities, and even the highest administrative organs, should prioritize education and take decisive measures against private schools that do not comply with the law, in order to demonstrate the government's determination to safeguard education. On the other hand, if it is indeed impossible to maintain the lives of teachers and staff as a result of complying with the tuition fee standards, we hope that the education authorities, based on the principle of "stabilizing people's livelihoods," one of the national policies promulgated by the highest state organs, will also take into account the reality of Shanghai today and make reasonable adjustments to the already promulgated laws and regulations, in order to maintain education with determination. Otherwise, the flight of excellent teachers due to the inability to maintain the lives of teachers and staff will also have unimaginable consequences.</p>
<p>According to the previous curriculum standards of the education authorities, the distribution of courses, number of students, and teaching hours for teachers in secondary schools is as follows: (1) The number of students in each grade is at least 30 and at most 50. (2) The number of class sessions per week per class is 30, with each session lasting 50 minutes. (3) Each full-time teacher should have a maximum of 20 teaching sessions per week.</p>
<p>As for the principle of salary distribution for teachers and staff, it is: after deducting the school building rent from the total amount of all tuition revenue, 30% is used for the school's operating expenses, and 70% is used for the salaries of teachers and staff. As for the distribution of teachers' and staff's salaries, 30% of the teachers' and staff's salaries is used for the salaries of the staff, and 70% is used for the salaries of the teachers.</p>
<p>Based on the above standards, and with the changes in the wartime environment! Assuming that the number of students in each grade is 40, and the full-time teachers increase their working hours to 30 teaching sessions per week, according to the Municipal Education Bureau's standards for collecting student fees: (Junior high school fee standard)</p>
<p>The tuition revenue per grade is 240,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The monthly classroom rental fee per grade is tentatively set at 200 yuan, totaling 1,200 yuan. According to 30% of 238,800 yuan, or 71,640 yuan, for the school's operating expenses, there is still a remaining 167,160 yuan. Then, deducting 30% of the staff's salaries, or 50,148 yuan, the remaining teacher salaries are 117,012 yuan. The monthly teacher salary (calculated for six months) is 19,502 yuan, and the weekly teacher salary is 4,875.50 yuan. With 30 teaching sessions per week per class, each teaching session totals approximately 162.50 yuan. Each full-time teacher teaches 30 sessions per week and receives a weekly teacher salary of 4,875 yuan, with a monthly salary of 19,360 yuan. With this amount, it is impossible to maintain a living in Shanghai, even for a "bachelor," and it is impossible to maintain the minimum requirement of three meals a day. As for supporting a family, even with the "priority ration rice" of three dou per month, which is converted to 12,000 yuan at the recent peak black market rice price of 40,000 yuan per dan, the total monthly income is 31,360 yuan. It is indeed difficult to support a family of four with this amount of income. However, if the government has a firm grasp and can find a way to compensate for the living expenses of all teachers and staff in the city who are deficient as a result of complying with the standards for tuition fees promulgated by the bureau, then it is unnecessary to say that the various private primary and secondary schools should absolutely comply with government laws and regulations. Otherwise, the education authorities should also pay attention to reality and should not disregard the lives of teachers and staff.</p>
<p>However, based on the facts of the past semester, almost all principals of private schools in the city have made huge profits. Those who used tuition revenue to open ham stores, and those who used tuition income as capital for the school principal to "run a side business" (see "A Record of the Investigation of School Stores" in the January 18th issue of the New China News), are not worth mentioning. Even those who "abide by the rules" and only use the collected tuition fees to earn interest are making considerable profits. Let's calculate again using the above examples, the principal's income, and the actual income and expenditure situation as follows:</p>
<p>With a revenue of 240,000 yuan per grade, calculating with a monthly interest rate of 10%, the actual revenue per grade at the end of the first month is already 264,000 yuan. Paying the first month's teacher and staff salaries of 27,860 yuan, plus the first month's classroom rental fee of 200 yuan, totals 28,060 yuan. Adding the school's operating expenses of 11,940 yuan, the total expenditure for the first month is 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Subsequent expenses remain the same, while the income is still calculated according to the above method. After six months, the income and expenditure are offset, and a net profit of more than 116,000 yuan can be obtained. The salaries of teachers and staff under the expenditure item remain the same each month, and the rent aspect, in fact, rarely increases. On the operating expenses side, there is no such huge expenditure per classroom each month.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to this calculation, the principal of each classroom with 40 students can obtain a minimum net profit of more than 116,500 yuan in one semester. If there are a total of six grades in junior and senior high school, with 40 students in each grade, the net profit obtained by the principal will reach more than 699,800 yuan. This huge amount of income is taken from the labor and effort of teachers and staff and goes into the principal's private pockets. This unfairness is also an undeniable fact. We believe that the distribution of teachers' and staff's salaries must be re-adjusted to achieve a reasonable level of sharing both the good and the bad, and to avoid the unfair situation of happiness and suffering being vastly different.</p>
<p>As for how to distribute the salaries in a reasonable way, the following points can be provided for reference:</p>
<p>(1) The salaries of teachers and staff are paid in one lump sum for six months at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p>(2) The salaries of teachers and staff are prepaid for three months at the beginning of the semester, and the remaining three months are divided into six installments and paid monthly.</p>
<p>(3) 70% of the monthly interest earned from tuition fees is extracted as a "living allowance" in addition to the teachers' and staff's salaries. (For example, if the interest income in the first month is 24,000 yuan, 16,800 yuan should be extracted as a "living allowance" in addition to the teachers' and staff's salaries. The remainder will be used as the principal's "living allowance" to demonstrate fairness.)</p>
<p>Originally, the salary distribution method promulgated by the ministry was a fair arrangement. However, when this method was promulgated, neither the rise and fall of currency values nor the fluctuations of commodity prices were as crazy as they are now. Therefore, in order to adapt to the current economic situation and to achieve a reasonable solution to the lives of both "labor and management" in the education sector, it is impossible not to change the facts. Regarding this point, the principals of private primary and secondary schools should also be deeply ashamed of being criticized as "school store owners" and should treat teachers and staff with a fair attitude and a spirit of "shared destiny," devoting themselves to the education cause to which the life of the nation and the people is entrusted. At the same time, it is also hoped that the government authorities will face the difficult realities and give full consideration to the rescue of dropouts, and also attach equal importance to maintaining the lives of teachers and staff.</p>
<p>In short, it is necessary to endure hardships and reduce material enjoyment in life during wartime, but we cannot ignore the need to guarantee the minimum living standard. The so-called "starving stomach to serve the public" is not something that can be done in real life.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commando Units Severely Damage American Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since landing on the southern coast of Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, American forces have been exerting all efforts to establish a bridgehead there. They have recently launched offensives but have encountered fierce counterattacks from Japanese forces near the coast between Lingayen and Dagupan, resulting in heavy casualties. Currently, they have advanced to the Agno River, between ten kilometers south of Lingayen and twenty-five kilometers south of Dagupan, with a portion of their forces crossing the southern bank of the Agno River. Simultaneously, enemy forces facing San Fabian are also expanding their bridgehead, utilizing undulating terrain about one hundred to two hundred meters high to construct fortifications. A portion of the American forces has broken into the Japanese first line of defense, intensifying the battle. However, viewed broadly, the decisive battle between the main forces on both sides in the Luzon Island campaign has not yet reached its climax. General Yamashita, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, upon assuming his post, immediately ordered his subordinates to exert their fighting spirit in the vast Philippine territory. Luzon Island, resembling a continent in shape and possessing the characteristics of mainland warfare geographically, is a battlefield where the Japanese forces are most proficient. The main Japanese forces are maximally utilizing the geographical characteristics of Luzon Island, maintaining an immovable defense, and preparing for battle. Since the enemy landing, Japanese commando units have been continuously infiltrating enemy positions day and night with war poles and hand grenades, engaging in brave attacks. On the night of the 16th, several powerful Japanese commando units launched fierce attacks on enemy positions in San Fabian, Alacan, six kilometers east of San Fabian at Labit, seven kilometers east of San Fabian, and other locations, achieving significant results. On that night, Lieutenant Sato led commando troops, taking advantage of the night, to infiltrate the enemy position in Alacan, destroying eight new tanks, forty-six self-propelled guns, and many motor trucks, and also blowing up a grain and ammunition depot about one kilometer long. Lieutenant Sato then made a lone advance into the enemy position in Bitik, six kilometers east of San Fabian, destroying eleven enemy barracks with hand grenades. By this morning, the entire unit had returned safely to their defenses. Furthermore, the commando unit led by Lieutenant Urakami attacked the enemy position in Labit on the night of the 16th, killing a large number of enemy soldiers and capturing four heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, one automatic rifle, and about two thousand rounds of handguns and machine gun ammunition. Other Japanese suicide squads that infiltrated San Fabian also achieved great success. On the night of the 16th, large explosions and fires occurred in the enemy camp, causing many areas to be burned. The enemy artillery positions around San Fabian, Labit, and Alacan had been fiercely shelling the Japanese positions for days, but after the Japanese commando units attacked, they ceased fire from the night of the 16th to the morning of the 18th, completely halting their operations. At the same time, after a fierce attack by elite Japanese units north of San Fabian, enemy casualties reached about one thousand six hundred by the 17th, not including those killed by the Japanese assaults. In addition, one enemy heavy artillery piece was destroyed, and fourteen boats were sunk. The number of heavy and light machine guns, handguns, and vehicles captured and destroyed was extremely high. Even before the main Japanese forces have moved, the enemy has already suffered heavy damage. Therefore, the Japanese commando tactics have terrified the enemy.</p>

<h3>American Supply Difficulties After Landing in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Zurich, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch obtained in Geneva, after the American forces landed on Luzon Island, the Allied merchant fleet must simultaneously supply both the eastern and western fronts, making the shipping problem extremely difficult. The round trip from the United States to the Philippines takes one hundred to one hundred and four days, allowing for only two or three round trips per year. The Washington Quartermaster Corps expects General MacArthur to face real difficulties in supply. There are two major difficulties: (1) The Philippine theater consists of thousands of small islands, with very narrow waterways, making navigation difficult. (2) The American supply lines connecting Leyte, Mindoro, and Luzon are constantly threatened by the Japanese air force.</p>

<p>Readers' Scholarship News</p>
<h3>Urgent Appeal!</h3>
<p>Within Ten Days - Achieve the Goal - Five Thousand Students - Eagerly Awaiting</p>
<p>"In just ten short days, the predetermined goal must be achieved,"—20 million yuan. Because in just ten more days, schools will open, and poor students are like baby birds waiting to be fed, waiting for the distribution of scholarships. And we have been running around calling for help, almost to the point of exhaustion. In the past fifty days, the donations received have only reached six-tenths of the goal; even if the remainder is raised, it will still be insufficient for distribution. There is too little porridge for too many monks, and we always feel caught in a dilemma. Some people often worry on our behalf, thinking that even if we raise 45 million yuan for more than 4,500 students, each person will only receive 10,000 yuan, and in fact, this 10,000 yuan is not enough. That is true, but we have a firm belief that we can achieve the goal within ten days. Moreover, Shanghai has so many enthusiastic people and so many wealthy merchants. Would they stand idly by? I think no one wants to see poor students drop out of school for no reason! And no one wants to see the scholarship movement on the verge of collapse! Our only wish is that all the virtuous and enlightened individuals will quickly donate so time goes by like an arrow. Do not hesitate! Do not wait and see! Poor students are waiting impatiently.</p>
<p>(Note) This newspaper's "special fundraising" has been enthusiastically promoted by various circles in Shanghai, for which we are deeply grateful. In particular, the students from various schools have provided the strongest support. However, fundraising has a certain method. For example, when soliciting donations from relatives and friends individually, first fill out the recognition team notification form and send the donation to this newspaper, or notify this newspaper to send someone to collect the donation. Only "official receipts" will be considered valid. Recently, students from a certain school have been publicly soliciting donations in public places. This method is prone to cause misunderstandings and many abuses, for which this newspaper is not responsible. We hope that the students of various schools will pay attention.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Tuition Fee Standards</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This semester has ended, and the next semester is about to begin. Regarding the issue of tuition fees for all levels of schools in the next semester, although the Municipal Education Bureau has announced fee standards, there are different opinions due to different standpoints. Schools argue that tuition fees should be increased proportionally due to high prices, while parents argue that tuition fees should not increase sharply due to the high cost of living. Teachers and staff hope that schools will improve their treatment with the increased tuition fees. The standards set by the Education Bureau also have their objective reasons and are by no means easy to decide. This newspaper has received many letters expressing opinions from all sides. We have selected several articles to compile into a special issue, trying to preserve the subjective opinions of the commentators as much as possible, to provide objective judgments to the authorities and those concerned about education, in order to stimulate research and obtain a more reasonable conclusion. In addition to the four articles published in this issue, another article will be published in the weekly review. We hope readers will pay attention. In addition, it is heard that the education authorities are already considering increasing the fee standards and deciding to announce them. The main purpose should still be to take into account the burden on parents and the actual expenses of the school, and it will certainly not be as high as the standards set by some private schools, which can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Save the Parents of Elementary School Students</h3>
<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>Recently, prices have soared. Parents of elementary school students not only bear the heavy pressure of supporting the whole family, but also have to raise funds for their children's tuition fees for the next semester. According to the highest standards for tuition fees charged by private primary and secondary schools set by the Education Bureau, the lower grades of elementary schools should not exceed 3,200 yuan, the middle grades should not exceed 3,600 yuan, and the higher grades should not exceed 4,000 yuan (see Shenbao on the 9th of this month). However, the reality is quite different. According to what the author has heard, Zhongxi Elementary School has decided to charge 22,000 yuan, Peter Elementary School has set 20,000 yuan internally, and other private elementary schools generally charge more than 10,000 yuan. It can be said that there are very few schools that charge according to the highest standards of the Municipal Education Bureau. Assuming that a parent has to support four school-age children, the expenses, including books, etc., will inevitably require raising nearly 100,000 yuan. Given the current difficult living conditions, most parents cannot afford it, and the result is only dropping out of school. Some people may say that if school fees are too high, they can change to another school, but on the one hand, school fees are generally increasing, and on the other hand, elementary school students must choose schools that are closer to home and convenient for commuting, and there is often no possibility of changing schools.</p>
<p>I don't know what standards are used to calculate the high tuition fees charged by general elementary schools. Assuming that each elementary school student's tuition fee is 20,000 yuan, and there are 40 students in a class (in fact, about 50), 800,000 yuan can be collected. If teachers' salaries are calculated at 70% (according to Article 4 of the fee standards set by the Education Bureau), 560,000 yuan can be obtained. If there is one teacher per class on average, then the monthly salary (averaged over six months) will be no less than 100,000 yuan. Not only is the salary of university professors beyond reach, but even in terms of the salaries of ordinary people, it may not be so high!</p>
<p>Since the Education Bureau has set the highest standards for tuition fees, what attitude does it take towards these schools that do not follow the standards and charge seven or eight times higher than the standards? In order to maintain the government's prestige and reduce school dropouts, the excess parts that have been collected should be ordered to be returned. If the fees have been set but not collected, they should be ordered to be revised. If there is any violation, the board of directors should be directly ordered to rehire the principals and teachers.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a word to say to these schools that charge seven or eight times higher than the standard. Education is a job, not a business. In this turbulent era, education is the most important part of revitalizing the nation. People who dedicate themselves to education must maintain a minimum standard of living on the one hand, and on the other hand, they must have the spirit of sacrificing for education and cannot be eager for material comfort. Now that the general public is living in such difficult circumstances and elementary school tuition fees are so high, it directly forces students to drop out of school and indirectly cuts off the lifeline of the country. This is certainly not the original intention of education providers. Moreover, although prices are high, elementary school teachers' monthly salaries of 100,000 yuan are also too luxurious, aren't they?</p>
<h3>My Opinion on the Tuition Fee Issue</h3>
<p>— Qian Tianqi</p>
<p>After the news of the restriction on tuition fee standards for private schools was published in various newspapers this time, many parents were relieved, but people in the education sector were very disturbed. Some private school authorities who seriously run education have to take into account the burden on students' parents, the lives of teachers and teaching efficiency, and the law; therefore, they have encountered unprecedented difficulties. Here, I would like to discuss the issue of tuition fees (limited to primary and secondary schools) from the perspective of a citizen and propose countermeasures for the reference of those concerned about education.</p>
<p>(1) The General Situation of Private Schools in This Semester: For private schools above the general level, the tuition fees for the last semester were about 6,000 yuan for high schools, 5,800 yuan for junior high schools, and 4,000 yuan for elementary schools (when tuition fees were set, the price of rice was 8,000 yuan per stone). Teachers' salaries accounted for more than 70% of the total income. Teachers' salaries are calculated by the number of hours. The average salary for high school teachers is about 200 yuan per hour per week, 180 yuan for junior high school teachers, and 120 yuan for elementary school teachers per 50 minutes. Full-time teachers teach an average of 25 hours, and the monthly salary is 20,000 yuan for high schools, 18,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 12,000 yuan for elementary school teachers. These schools have more students and more income, so they have voluntarily given up requesting food rations and education association subsidies. The number of teaching hours per week is more than 31 hours in middle schools and more than 1,400 minutes in elementary schools. The allocation of courses, the progress of teaching, the general study and the examination of students' homework and grades can all follow the old habits before the war without any slack. This semester has finally passed smoothly. The tuition fees for the next semester are about 30,000 yuan for high schools, 107,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 16,000 yuan for elementary schools. As far as I know, after most schools announced the amount of tuition fees, the number of students who paid the fixed amount of money was more than 80%. As for schools below the level, the tuition fees for this period are between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan, but some only have classes for half a day, or the number of hours per week is only about 25 hours. Teachers' salaries can only provide teachers with the lowest standard of living. Teachers and students are free to be absent. Teachers need to be of lower and lower quality. Students have no homework other than class.</p>
<p>(2) Review of the Recent Tuition Fee Notice: According to the news published in Shenbao, the tuition fees for high schools in the next semester are set at 7,500 yuan, 6,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 5,000 yuan for elementary schools. In addition, the amount of food rations has been increased (recently, 3 dou per person per month) and administrative subsidies have been allocated. This plan was also quite reasonable; but why are the authorities and teachers of various private schools so disturbed? There are three reasons. First, it is said that the standard for tuition fees was set when the price of rice was still 12,000 yuan. Now that prices have soared, if it is not modified, then in another month or two, the school will simply become a dried fish. Second, the food ration has been increased to 3 dou this month, which is enough for one and a half people to consume. On average, a family of three still has one and a half people who have no rations (this only refers to eating raw rice). As for teachers' salary income, if it is in accordance with the prescribed standards, it is about the same as this semester, between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. How many coal balls, how much green vegetables, how many pounds of butter, and how many pairs of socks can this amount buy? If there is any obstacle to the distribution of rations, the consequences can be imagined. Therefore, teachers cannot help but be disturbed. Third, assuming that the administrative subsidy fee is 500,000 yuan per school per semester on average, but according to the current price index, the monthly repair and purchase of school buildings, school equipment, staff and school workers' meals, water and electricity, rent and taxes, teaching consumption, and miscellaneous consumption of each school are more than 500,000 yuan. How can the budget be balanced? Moreover, the number of large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai that should receive subsidies is far more than 300. It is still questionable whether each school can get an average of 500,000 yuan. Therefore, the authorities of various schools cannot help but have some doubts.</p>
<p>(3) Reasonable Standard for Tuition Fee Increase: In a country that is on track, tuition fees are not a problem. Elementary schools not only do not charge fees, but even textbooks are provided by the state. But in the past, Shanghai had a population of 3 million, with more than 250,000 school-age children, while the number of municipal primary and secondary school places was less than 50,000. Therefore, private schools came into being. But now, when people's purchasing power is extremely weak, middle and lower class families can no longer afford private school tuition fees, so there is a call for tuition fee restrictions. Speaking of the tuition fee standards of private schools, I think there should only be one formula:</p>
<p>(The minimum cost of food, clothing, shelter, and medical care for the average family of three of all school teachers + the total administrative expenses of the school) - (Government subsidies + food and daily necessities rations) = the total amount of tuition fees that students should bear.</p>
<p>The Chinese have always prided themselves on being a country that respects teachers and values education. Can we sit idly by and watch teachers' hair unkempt (it now costs 500 yuan to get a haircut), their bodies dirty (it costs 1,000 yuan to take a bath), and their clothes tattered (a set of old cloth short shirts and pants costs 8,000 yuan, including labor)? Can we sit idly by and watch teachers' wives and children cold and hungry, and teachers go to the podium with empty stomachs? Can we sit idly by and watch teachers suffer from malnutrition and be sick in public (it now costs 2,000 yuan for medical treatment and medicine for a cold and fever)? If the government takes into account that student families cannot afford huge tuition fees, it can only find ways to provide relief, and it cannot simply think of reducing the minimum living expenses of teachers. If it is considered that the government is unable to bear it, then students' parents will have to bear more. You need to know how much Central Reserve Bank notes the monthly feed for a Dutch cow costs now. Is the value of a teacher's teaching really less than ten pounds of milk? The manager of the dairy farm also knows that the feed for the cow can be reduced a little, and the quality can be slightly worse, but he calculates that the amount of milk produced will also decrease, so he has to spare no expense. This is the so-called minimum cost of living. In short, you get what you pay for. If you want the horse to be good, you have to let it eat more grass. I believe that students' parents are willing to endure it temporarily within the possible range, so that their children will not drop out of school, and they will not be greedy for small advantages at the moment, and let their children suffer from negligent teaching and waste a semester of time. You need to know that children's education expenses should be included as the first item in the family expenditure budget. After all, people live for their children. As for the school authorities, they should be economically absolutely open, and strive to save administrative expenses (but the teaching equipment, such as books and instruments, should not be less than the minimum), and the proportion of teachers' salaries should be increased as much as possible. As for the teachers, in addition to maintaining the minimum family life, they should not have extravagant demands, strive for a strict life, strive for serious teaching, and do not collect any extra fees from students under false pretenses. In this way, even if the average student parent bears a little more tuition fees, it is not a waste. There is one more point. The so-called minimum living expenses of teachers cannot be based on the life at the beginning of the school year. The living index in the middle of the semester should be used as the standard. However, such calculations are quite difficult. Therefore, I advocate changing the collection of real objects according to the example of the land tax and collecting rice, about 7 dou for high schools, 6.5 dou for junior high schools, and 5 dou for elementary schools, which can be used as a precedent. Teachers' salaries will be paid with rice. I know that this proposal is not easy to get the support of all parties, but we really can't think of any reasons to object.</p>
<p>(4) Remedial Measures After the Tuition Fee Increase: Now, according to what I know, in the dozens of relatively excellent schools, after the tuition fees for the next semester were set, only 20% of the students did not pay the retention money. Among them, 10 were going to receive scholarships from the Xin Shenbao newspaper, or were going to transfer schools, find employment, or return to their hometowns. Ten people were indeed unable to afford the tuition fees due to economic difficulties. For these students, the school should naturally waive their tuition fees. As for the schools with poor grades, some of the students who have not paid the fixed amount account for more than 50%. This situation is more serious (naturally, some of them are not because they cannot afford the tuition fees). In addition, there are new students who are willing to enroll, but cannot afford the tuition fees and are wandering outside the school gate. These all have to find another way. I have four countermeasures.</p>
<p>(1) The authorities should strictly order all schools whose tuition fees exceed the standards (which must be revised according to the living index) to strictly follow the law to increase the number of free and reduced-fee students and send personnel to conduct thorough investigations.</p>
<p>(2) All schools whose tuition fees exceed the standards shall not receive any subsidies, grants, or food rations.</p>
<p>(3) The municipal government can take out 30% to 50% of the original total amount of administrative subsidies for private schools and increase the funding for municipal schools, instructing the city to expand the number of schools and classes to accommodate students who have dropped out of school.</p>
<p>(4) All schools that receive administrative subsidies and other subsidies should re-regulate the number of free and reduced-fee students.</p>
<p>Finally, I will summarize it; (1) Do not ignore the reasons why some private schools perform well. (2) The adjustment of tuition fees must be considered under the condition that it does not hinder "the stability of teachers' lives." Do not interfere with schools where teachers' lives are relatively stable. (3) It seems unnecessary to reduce the fees for private schools where the tuition fees for the next semester are over 20,000 yuan and the number of retained students is 80%. (4) The tuition fee standards for private schools recently announced must be revised again. If the fees charged by schools exceed this revised standard, they will not be subsidized or given food rations. (5) The revised standard for tuition fees must be based on the living index of teachers' families. (6) The living index of teachers' families should be determined by calculating the living index in the middle of the semester based on the rate of increase in the living index in the most recent half year. The first semester must calculate the index in April, and the second semester must calculate the index in November. (7) A part of the tuition fees of private schools adopts a free system, and a part of the private schools that receive subsidies and food rations, and all municipal schools, charge fees according to the newly set standards, and increase the number of students and classes. In this way, the three aspects of students, teachers, and regulations can be taken care of.</p>
<h3>An Appeal to Private Schools</h3>
<p>— Zhang Meng</p>
<p>According to a notice received by a parent from a certain private school authority, they are demanding payment of a reservation fee of $500 per student, a school janitor subsidy of $40, and a winter vacation practice paper fee of $100, totaling $640. They are also stipulating the tuition fees for the next semester: Senior high school $28,000, junior high school $26,000, middle school $24,000, and elementary school $16,000 (including book fees), all to be paid in full before the Lunar New Year. In contrast, the tuition fees for municipal schools are: Senior high school $2,400, junior high school $1,800, senior elementary school $1,600, intermediate elementary school $1,400, and junior elementary school $1,200. The tuition fees charged by municipal and private schools are as different as heaven and earth. So, what is the basis for these private schools' standards?</p>
<p>It is very common for a family to have five or six children in school. Enrolling children in municipal schools is currently very difficult, but enrolling them in private schools requires a family to pay over ten thousand dollars in tuition for five or six children. Parents earning a monthly salary of two or three thousand dollars must consider both household expenses and their children's education. In reality, it is impossible, and their children will have to drop out of school.</p>
<p>Everyone has a sense of compassion. I hope that the municipal authorities will strictly supervise private schools and implement the school fee standards announced a few days ago.</p>
<h3>How to Solve the Tuition Fee Problem</h3>
<p>— Gui Fu</p>
<p>Time flies, and the semester is coming to an end again. Due to soaring prices, tuition fees for the next semester in various schools have increased several times compared to the previous semester. It is rumored that some private schools in this city will charge the following tuition fees for the next semester: elementary school from $15,000 to $20,000, junior high school from $20,000 to $25,000, senior high school from $25,000 to $30,000, and universities over $40,000. While the increase in tuition fees aims to maintain school expenses and teachers' livelihoods, it also increases the burden on parents, which will inevitably lead to a large number of students dropping out of school. As citizens, we are concerned about this serious problem. I, despite my limited knowledge, would like to propose a few specific measures for the authorities to adopt:</p>
<p>1.  Impose Education Taxes. I remember that someone proposed this idea in the "National Forum." The government can levy entertainment taxes and taxes on various consumer goods and luxury goods, or add a small amount to these taxes as subsidies.</p>
<p>2.  Increase Rations. Compared to the salaries in other industries, teachers' salaries are the lowest. The income of a middle school teacher is only enough to maintain their personal life; the income of an elementary school teacher is not even enough to maintain their personal life (even in schools that follow the Education Bureau's regulations for open financial management). Fortunately, the education authorities, understanding the difficult lives of teachers, provided a special ration of rice last semester. This allowed them to barely maintain their personal lives. However, this is only limited to individuals. To support a family and allow teachers to focus on their work, the same rations should be provided to their families. Mr. Dai, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, was particularly concerned about this issue during his speech at the end of last year, and the *Shen Bao*'s editorial also made a strong appeal recently. We have high hopes for this.</p>
<p>3.  Use Commercial Profits to Subsidize Education Expenses. The Economic Bureau should order various trade associations to bear a proportional share of education expenses based on the number of their members and their position in the commercial world. Subsequently, whenever prices rise, this funding should increase by the same multiple as the price increase.</p>
<p>In addition to being responsible for raising these funds, the Education Bureau and the Economic Bureau should also be responsible for supervising and managing the funds. The management must be fair, and a detailed investigation of the situation of each school must be conducted. There should also be reasonable regulations for teachers' salaries, and measures should be taken to prevent corruption.</p>
<p>In summary, although these are not thorough solutions to the tuition fee problem, as long as one of them can be implemented, the tuition fees for the next semester can at least be temporarily resolved. Students can avoid the worry of dropping out of school. However, "stopping boiling water by pouring it out is not as good as removing the firewood from under the pot." To fundamentally solve this problem, one must start by stabilizing prices. If prices continue to rise, even if tuition fees are reduced to a minimum, parents will still be unable to afford them and will have to force their children to become street vendors, apprentices, or even scavengers (this phenomenon is already very common). "He who loves his country must love his people." I hope that the authorities will address the earnest expectations of us common people and find a solution as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Unwavering Faith</h3>
<p>— Captain Shioda, China Area Fleet News Department</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the New Year, the war has intensified. In the Philippines theater, the enemy Americans landed in Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island on the 9th of this month, fully demonstrating America's posture of a general counterattack on the Philippines. It is true that the enemy Americans, with their landing at Leyte Gulf on October 20th of last year, their landing on Mindoro Island on December 25th, and the current landing at Lingayen Gulf, have been able to proclaim to their own people that the day of the Philippines' recovery can be foreseen. However, from our perspective, it is precisely the opposite. The enemy Americans are now deeply mired in an unprecedentedly astonishing war of attrition. Although the United States suffered a devastating blow in the Leyte Gulf and Philippine Sea battles last October, they still collected all their remaining fleets, implemented a fleet preservation policy, and used diplomatic tactics to manipulate Churchill, not allowing the British fleet to grow too large and increase its voice, so they demanded that the British fleet be sent to East Asia to fight. In short, the enemy Americans' goal is to break through Japan's inner line with one blow. Due to the current unstable domestic situation and the dead-end strategy, the enemy Americans have had to pay a great price in the Philippines. If we estimate the huge losses in the Philippines, the success of the three landings at Leyte, Mindoro, and Lingayen is by no means a blessing for the United States.</p>
<p>Situation of Battles in the Philippines Area</p>
<p>Everyone knows that landing on the Philippines, which consists of over four thousand islands, is extremely easy and not surprising, nor is it due to the Japanese army's lack of foresight. It is just like the arrangement made in advance by the Japanese army, hoping that the Americans would attack along the ninety-two miles from Lingayen to Manila, in order to carry out the tactic of concentrating and annihilating them.</p>
<p>However, everyone should not ignore that the Japanese army on Leyte Island is still completely intact. In seventy days, it held back one million tons of American ships and tens of thousands of troops, and annihilated tens of thousands of American soldiers, while always protecting the Bulaven and San Pablo airfields. As for the losses suffered by the enemy Americans when two divisions landed on Mindoro as a springboard for attacking Luzon, they were also enormous.</p>
<p>MacArthur once declared that recovering the Philippines would require 200,000 troops. From this point, it can be proved how huge the military supplies, aircraft, and ammunition that the general counterattack will require. However, according to information from various sources, it can be determined that the enemy Americans will concentrate all their strength on the Philippines at any cost and regardless of any sacrifice. In terms of troop strength alone, although 200,000 troops have already been concentrated on the Philippines, this manpower and material resources are constantly being attacked by the Japanese army's courageous attacks and suffering enormous losses. In particular, the Japanese air force has all become Kamikaze special attack teams, bombing enemy American ships. Even reconnaissance planes carry bombs to bomb enemy ships. Special submarines have formed swimming special attack teams, each carrying a bomb, to attack enemy American transport ships. All of the above facts have given the enemy Americans unexpected and enormous attrition, causing the enemy Americans to panic.</p>
<p>Nimitz and MacArthur, stealing past the Japanese submarine and air force surveillance networks from Australia, New Guinea, Hollandia, etc., and then through Ulithi in Palau, bring in soldiers and equipment, which are attacked everywhere by the Japanese army's human torpedoes, often destroying eight hundred, one thousand, or one thousand five hundred people at a time. Such losses cannot be considered small for the United States. These special attack teams will, together with the human torpedo breaching tactics at 203 Hill carried out by our fathers or grandfathers in the previous Russo-Japanese War, be forever recorded in history.</p>
<p>Such enormous attrition will certainly have a significant impact on the enemy Americans' combat power in the final decisive battle. From this point, it can also be seen that the reason why the anxious enemy is constantly carrying out battles that are not permitted by tactics and advancing into the Japanese army's inner line. In other words, it can be determined that the enemy Americans are establishing several bridgeheads to carry out unsound operations, using adventure to prevent domestic unrest. Therefore, the enemy Americans are trying hard to land in southern China or Annam and establish bridgeheads to cut off Japan's supply line with the South Seas. The enemy seems to have already understood that whether they are stopped in the Philippines or proceed to attack the mainland, they will suffer extremely bitter battles. It can really be said that an American path to decline has already unfolded before the enemy Americans who are trying to destroy Japan. The enemy knows very well that if they carry out a long-term war, they will only collapse internally, disintegrate, and destroy themselves. The enemy's attempt to carry out unreasonable operations on the mainland can also be guessed from the fact that General Nimitz dispatched the main fleet to disrupt the waters east of Taiwan and the Philippines. Furthermore, in terms of material resources, the United States also has an absolute advantage, and the antiquated British dilapidated fleet is also coordinating with Nimitz's offensive, continuing to stir up trouble in the waters off Sumatra. In addition, there are the American Fifth and Seventh Fleets operating in the Philippines, Fraser's British Fleet, and the Australian Fleet, all actively operating. This is enough to see where the enemy will operate further.</p>
<p>Enemy Americans' Attrition Cannot Be Sustained</p>
<p>As for where the enemy will send a large number of mainland troops to China, the United States is suffering from the depletion of human resources, which is an undeniable weakness of the enemy. If the enemy American transport ships currently engaged in diversionary operations in Lamon Bay attempt to land in Lamon Bay, the outcome must be that a considerable force will be dispatched from MacArthur's army, which is currently engaged in combat. However, MacArthur, who is personally directing operations on Luzon Island, is already suffering from a shortage of troops, so how can he have the spare capacity to send troops to help others? Under the guidance of General Yamashita, the commander-in-chief, and Vice Admiral Okawachi, the father of the Shanghai Iron-Blooded Landing Force, the Japanese army is not carrying out a decisive battle in Lingayen, but wants to wait at leisure and fight the enemy in the great plains of Luzon south of the Agno River. Even if the enemy has the continuous reinforcement of a superior air force, there is no doubt that the enemy will suffer enormous losses in manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>A few days ago, three enemy American destroyers, full of troops, which had gathered in New Guinea, were blown away by a typhoon and their whereabouts are unknown. It can be said that this is no small loss for the enemy. Even if the entire population of the United States, 136 million, is calculated as Americans, even if the number of people who can be mobilized is 50%, it has already exceeded 50% now. For example, Secretary of the Army Stimson said on the 11th of this month: "The war against Japan has already used more troops than budgeted, but in order to meet the demands of the front line, we must continue to draft soldiers from farms, factories, and government agencies." This year alone, it has already been decided to draft 80,000 soldiers in January, 80,000 soldiers in February, and 100,000 soldiers in March. However, for fear that production on the other hand will decrease, they are trying their best to make production machinery automatic in order to save manpower. In any case, the excessively high rate of manpower attrition means that the United States will be unable to cope.</p>
<p>As for material resources, domestic unrest is forcing war leaders to adopt short-term operational strategies. This year's aircraft production has decreased by 2,000 aircraft compared to last year, which is the reason why the American army is eager to come far to the Philippines and the eastern Pacific to seek an opportunity for a decisive battle. However, the enemy Americans, having not yet recovered from the material attrition suffered in the Taiwan-Philippines sea and air battles, will never establish favorable tactics.</p>
<p>The Japanese Fleet Appears and Disappears Like Ghosts</p>
<p>The Japanese Combined Fleet will certainly not allow the Nimitz Fleet to invade Taiwan, Annam, the South China Sea, or the Philippines. The Third Fleet, the USS Halsey, which barely escaped from Japanese shelling in the Philippine Sea battle, will certainly not escape Japanese shelling this time.</p>
<p>Just like the Japanese Combined Fleet staying in Japanese waters forty years ago, it seems to be adopting a defensive operational form on the surface, but as soon as the opportunity matures, it will immediately adopt an offensive operation. The excellent tradition of the Imperial Japanese Navy has always been offensive. As soon as the opportunity arrives, it will immediately strike without hesitation, and then it will always eliminate the American-Australian Allied Fleet and achieve victory. Fraser's British Fleet will repeat the tragic scene of its disastrous defeat in the Philippine Sea battle.</p>
<p>Last October, after the Japanese Combined Fleet achieved a brilliant victory east of the Philippines, it appeared and disappeared like a ghost, making the enemy Americans suffer from nervous pain. During this period, Japan replenished its lost aircraft, worked hard to prepare cannons and torpedoes, and conserved its energy to wait for an opportunity. Furthermore, our Japanese naval soldiers are working hard to carry out the task of replenishing the Japanese army in the Philippines, which is engaged in difficult operations, or to carry out transportation line protection operations, or to attack the activities of enemy American submarines and aircraft that are nibbling at the South China Sea, and are carrying out the most difficult transportation replenishment.</p>
<p>The so-called war of attrition is a war of replenishment, which is the only factor that determines the victory or defeat of the Philippines, and which is the only factor that determines the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the operations of the Imperial Navy are extremely important, and the Japanese China Fleet is also carrying out this equally important task day and night. The Japanese China Fleet, together with many other fleets, is centered on the Combined Fleet, and is advancing on the vast Pacific Ocean towards the path of defeating the enemy Americans. However, the current decisive battleground has already shifted to the Philippine Islands. At the same time, the enemy Americans want to further use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, exposing their ambition, so the mission of our Japanese China Fleet will be correspondingly elevated.</p>
<p>Advancing Towards the Path of Victory</p>
<p>Our Japanese soldiers and civilians are completely united, giving the enemy Americans fatal blows everywhere on the sea and on the land in the Philippines, and exhausting their manpower and material resources, which will naturally lay a solid foundation for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. As mentioned earlier, the decisive battle is an extremely large war of attrition, and at the same time, the decisive battle is a continuous war. For this continuous decisive battle, a thorough victory system is needed now more than ever.</p>
<p>One is to increase production. A few days ago, a reporter said in a report on the decisive battle in the Philippines: "The enemy Americans have a favorable position in terms of air force strength." However, the Japanese soldiers and generals on the front lines of Lingayen personally saw enemy American transport fleets stop sailing due to lack of fuel, according to the reconnaissance of the air force unit. So we can imagine that the Japanese soldiers are eagerly awaiting air force replenishment. Frankly speaking, the replenishment of air force strength is one of the most important tasks at present.</p>
<p>The second is to raise the spirit of courage. Of course, every Japanese person has the unwavering belief in victory engraved in their heart. However, Nimitz is more determined than anyone else to invade the Philippines and the eastern Pacific, and finally establish a foothold on the Chinese mainland. As for MacArthur, he has been boasting every day for three years that he will recover the Philippines. At the same time, the American government, due to its domestic helplessness, will of course launch a torrent of strategic and ideological propaganda like a river bursting its banks. The Chongqing regime, which is lingering on the mainland, will seize this opportunity to launch aerial bombardments and carry out fierce propaganda work in peaceful areas. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party, which has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, will certainly launch its forte—propaganda work—in Shanghai in order to expand its territory. All of this is still in the realm of imagination. We Japanese people, in Shanghai, which is in such ideological chaos, if we respond to the ever-changing phenomena with an unwavering belief in victory, then the chaotic thoughts in Shanghai can be swept away, which is easy to achieve. Therefore, everyone must make the idea of "not stopping the war until victory is achieved" their only belief.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is certainly a huge war of attrition, but striving for victory in the war depends on the nation's will to persevere to the end. So, do not be worried or happy by the temporary changes in the war situation. Speak less and do more, and silently guard your respective occupational positions. No matter what difficult conditions you encounter, if you can persevere to the end and stick to your work, then I dare to assert that the enemy American fleet and landing army will certainly be buried in the belly of the fish, and not a single fragment will return. (January 15th)</p>
<p>Map of the Battle Situation on Luzon Island</p>
<p>The battle on Luzon Island is currently centered on Lingayen Gulf, with fierce fighting unfolding along a narrow front of fifty kilometers. Enemy troops are suffering fierce attacks from the Japanese army along the Agno River near Lingayen City. The Japanese army's powerful advancing troops also broke into the enemy's position near San Fabian, achieving great results.</p>

<h3>Smoke and Clouds</h3>
<p>— Lin Mang</p>
<p>In the golden sunset, the wind whispers in the treetops. In the shadows, a crumbling section of wall. On the wall, clinging ivy, covered in moss and water stains. In the center, a huge character for "Good Fortune," its original vermilion paint still faintly discernible, like a weary eye, staring at the empty mansion across the way. Beside the steps in front of the door, a pair of stone lions stand guard. From their imposing bodies, we can imagine the past glory of this mansion. Their eyes are wide open—are they lamenting: failing to hold back the bygone years? Or perhaps they are angry: sometimes a gust of wind sweeps past, leaving a layer of dirty street dust on their backs?</p>
<p>The empty mansion, its doors wide open; the peeling paint on the doors, telling of the vicissitudes of life. Vermilion pillars and ornate railings, some already dismantled, some crookedly remaining—let the wind, rain, and insects corrode their memories. —Like an old man's crutches,勉力 supporting that decaying body. In the courtyard, flourishing weeds obscure the winding paths, and how many crickets are busy in the tangled kudzu vines? The lotus pond is also silted up—it is said that in the days of past glory, a maid, having endured the master's whippings, secretly jumped in. But now, whether hate or admiration, it is all covered by broken stems and withered leaves. On the roof ridge, "tile flowers" grow everywhere. Disordered tiles cover the barren roof frame. Some say it is the mark of wind and rain, others say it was broken by naughty children climbing up to steal bird eggs. In reality, who can complain? Anyway, it is aging.</p>
<p>In the past, who didn't envy the carriages and retinues at the gate. Passersby would also stop to admire this magnificent mansion, listening to the clamor within. When those who loved bustle gathered at the gate, they would be driven away by the doorman's scolding. Those who were driven away, besides sighing, what could they do? Returning home, they would teach their children, comparing the glory here to the model they should strive for in the future.</p>
<p>But, who has truly understood the principle of rise and fall, knowing that this mansion would also decline? Now, where are those who used to scold? Perhaps, like those who often sat here as honored guests, they have dispersed and gone far away.</p>
<p>Only the old servant remains, huddled in a corner of this mansion, having seen all the vicissitudes of life. He is so old: white hair at his temples, a face full of wrinkles, missing teeth, hissing air when he speaks. Stooped, he shuffles along, cherishing past dreams, still maintaining the old attire. But like this mansion, he is also decaying.</p>
<p>At dusk, a traveler passes by, his steps faltering, indicating that he has traveled a long road. He lingers at the gate of this mansion, sighing endlessly.</p>
<p>Because of this, the old servant is deeply surprised. With his hands behind his back, he steps down from the stone steps and glances at the traveler. (He has not forgotten the demeanor of the past.)</p>
<p>"Guest, do you know my master?"</p>
<p>"No." He pauses for a moment: "But, because of our not very different fates, perhaps we are not strangers."</p>
<p>"Then, you must have met my young master."</p>
<p>"No. I also ask you, has your young master ever met me? In such a big world, who will meet whom?"</p>
<p>The old servant is stumped by these strange words.</p>
<p>The traveler wanders around the courtyard, sighing.</p>
<p>"Old servant, what are you waiting for here?"</p>
<p>The old man laughs silently, shaking his head for a while: "Do you think I would leave this house? I have lived half my life here, do you think I would throw it away like garbage? Would I go far away like those who used to eat and dress here?"</p>
<p>The traveler is silent.</p>
<p>"Then, what about your young master?"</p>
<p>"Are you still mentioning him? That prodigal son, a fellow who can't manage money, he went away long ago. He treated the ancestors' legacy as water in a jar. He poured it out, basin by basin, and then left. He never came back. But, it's also pitiful to say, outside, who cares about his food and clothing? He is the young master of a noble family."</p>
<p>The traveler seems thoughtful: "Suppose, he unfortunately died on the road?"</p>
<p>The old servant pauses for a moment. Suddenly, he says resolutely: "No. His ancestors accumulated great virtue, he won't have such a fate."</p>
<p>He sobs.</p>
<p>"Guest, do you know the background of my family?"</p>
<p>"Didn't he inherit a lot of money from his ancestors? He had a distinguished position, and he was also good at managing money. At that time, wasn't the front of this mansion blocked by a large procession of carriages and retinues? Didn't he keep a lot of people, giving them food and drink? But, he had an unfilial son, who scattered all the money after his death. So, he left this desolate place, a place of many memories for him, and went far away."</p>
<p>The old man exclaims in surprise, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>"I have also had such cloud-like days."</p>
<p>"And more," the old man lowers his head, seemingly immersed in the old dreams.</p>
<p>"But, I am tired."</p>
<p>The traveler steps down from the stone steps, brushing the dust from his body. The setting sun casts on him, leaving a lonely shadow on the ground. He stumbles away.</p>
<p>The old man watches his lonely figure, quietly pondering.</p>
<p>A gust of wind passes, raising dust on the street, a gray haze. A few fallen leaves rustle on the ground. Are they also feeling the desolation of this world?</p>
<h3>Actress</h3>
<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>In the morning, when the stage actress Guo Ying woke up, she heard a soft knock at the door, but she closed her eyes again, ignoring it. She was afraid that the person knocking would become impatient and break in. That person might be a reporter from the tabloid entertainment section, or perhaps a "critic"—no matter who he was, once he latched onto you, the morning would be miserable, with endless flattery that sounded like love talk, asking you for this and that... it was really unbearable.</p>
<p>However, the person knocked gently, without breaking in.</p>
<p>"Miss Guo," it was the voice of the old landlady, "an old man wants to see you."</p>
<p>"Tell him I'm not awake!"</p>
<p>"That won't do, Miss, the old man says he must see you, he has something important."</p>
<p>An old man with something important, strange. She thought, answering,</p>
<p>"Tell him to wait a moment, I haven't gotten up yet! Slowly, hey! What important thing does he have?"</p>
<p>"He won't say, the old man says he can't explain it clearly unless he sees you in person."</p>
<p>The actress sat at the table by the window, opening the letters she received yesterday. One was from the editor of a large magazine, asking her to write something about her recent "trip north," and another was from a fan. This letter, which took a great deal of effort to write, began like this:—</p>
<p>"I believe that being an actress is the noblest and most glorious... profession in the world," followed by a description of Miss Guo's beauty. Finally, he asked her to have coffee with him this afternoon.</p>
<p>The actress smiled as she finished reading the letter, counting that the person had used a total of twenty-one exclamation marks.</p>
<p>"Wu Yunfei"?! She read the man's full name, vaguely remembering a small clerk she met a few days ago at a company on Taishan Road. Wu Yunfei was that small clerk. That day, he entertained our Miss Guo quite diligently—to be honest, why shouldn't he be excited? Why shouldn't he be diligent? Think, in his whole life, could there be anything more significant than this? When Miss Guo bought something, he absolutely refused to accept the money. He also asked her for a signed photo, and wanted her to write like this:</p>
<p>"To Wu Yunfei," the actress thought to herself, tearing the letter with twenty-one exclamation marks to shreds and throwing it in the wastepaper basket. This was just as the old man, whom the old landlady had announced at the beginning of this article, strode into the room with a fierce look.</p>
<p>"Do you live in this room alone?" He looked at the furnishings in the room, asking:</p>
<p>"Two people live here," the actress replied, but she immediately felt that she shouldn't have answered that way. Why didn't she ask back: "Why are you asking?" Or simply chase him out. A stranger asking an actress this question upon first meeting was too dismissive of the other party's status.</p>
<p>However, the man sat down on his own. He seemed to have lost his rationality a little. In fact, such rude behavior was not in line with his upbringing. Read on, and you will know that he is an educated man.</p>
<p>"Miss Guo! Now I have only a glimmer of hope, please rent out this room! Perhaps..."</p>
<p>"Old gentleman, I don't understand what you mean," the actress said, "and besides, this room doesn't belong to me."</p>
<p>"I know, now I'm only asking for your consent, as for him, would he dare object?"</p>
<p>"This makes me even less understanding," the actress said, also muttering to herself: "She (Guo Ying is referring to the actress who lives with her) wouldn't dare object?"</p>
<p>The old man suddenly jumped up: "You vixen! You're playing dumb. Now I understand everything. Tell me, who gave you this room when you came back from Beijing this time? How many coats did he buy you? With so much money, if he doesn't spend it this way, where would it go?"</p>
<p>The actress laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"You're deliberately breaking up my family," the old man said agitatedly like a rooster; "Our family of scholars for generations is going to be ruined by your hand! Playing with actresses, will there be a good result from playing with actresses? Everyone knows that the Wu family is a family of integrity, who doesn't praise my good calligraphy? (Here, Guo Ying laughed again, she knew that some people are most afraid of others not knowing their special talents), take Yunfei, isn't this child always well-behaved?..."</p>
<p>"You say Wu Yunfei, is he your child?" The actress looked at this unfortunate old man, feeling indescribable sorrow. She already understood half of the tragedy.</p>
<p>"Wasn't he always well-behaved?" The old man continued: "But recently he suddenly lost over a hundred thousand, isn't all this money being spent on you?"</p>
<p>"Old gentleman, please calm down first, I want to explain to you, your son, Wu Yunfei, I know him a little..."</p>
<p>"Know him a little? You're lying again!"</p>
<p>"I really only met him once," she finally said, "as for cohabiting with him, etc., it's all nonsense. He probably lost these hundred thousand dollars gambling, or spent it on dance girls. I can guarantee with my personality that we actors will never spend other people's money unclearly, and we never thought of spending other people's money."</p>
<p>"Actress, has integrity? I don't believe your words, if you don't spend other people's money, whose money can you spend?" The old man became agitated again: "I personally found your photo on him, and people in his company all say that he often comes and goes with you..."</p>
<p>"Old gentleman, don't you suspect that this is all made up by your son? As for the signed photo..." So she repeated the truth again.</p>
<p>"Old gentleman, I also want to be impolite to your son!" The actress lengthened her face: "Let's go find him together, I want him to compensate for the damage to my reputation, we actresses are not easy to bully!"</p>
<p>"Miss Guo, don't get angry..." the old man said obsequiously: "It's better to talk it over, I'm just discussing with you, discussing, whether to rent out the room or not is up to you."</p>
<p>"The room doesn't belong to me at all, I told you earlier that two of us live here," she smiled "but that person is not your son, don't misunderstand," then suddenly said sharply: "I can't let others ruin my reputation outside, I want to deal with him!"</p>
<p>"Miss, it's better to talk it over" the old man said: "He didn't ruin your reputation! Don't be angry, this is all my old age's confusion, I didn't ask him clearly, you know, these two days have been so hard for me, my mind is completely muddled, these hundred thousand dollars, even if I broke my old bones and bankrupted my family, I still can't pay it back... Last night, in his drawer, not on him, I slapped him!—Found your photo, I thought this money must have been spent on you—Slapped me—My daughter said to me, you just came back from Beijing, this hundred thousand dollars is probably for renting a house, I thought this made sense, and thought there was a turning point, because if you rent this house, wouldn't you be able to repay this money? I didn't let Yunfei know, I came to see you early this morning, I'm so confused..." he cried, bending over and walking out.</p>
<p>The actress stood silently, she thought of the small clerk she met at that company on Taishan Road a few days ago, and also of the letter written with twenty-one exclamation marks, "2:00 PM this afternoon, I'll be waiting for you at the St. Brother's..." Haha, so confused.</p>
<p>"Being an actress is the noblest... profession in the world!" she repeated this sentence, clenching her teeth.</p>
<h3>Laundry Woman</h3>
<p>— Xi Yun</p>
<p>A chill climbs the treetops, the garden is already desolate, only by the ancient well, the laundry woman is working hard. Rolling up her sleeves, bending her waist. One moment using the brush, the next moment using soap; striving to eliminate the dirt.</p>
<p>Rubbing carefully, the soap foam piles up like snow. Never tired of rinsing several times in clear water.</p>
<p>Drying in the sunlight, look—the gauze scarf is as white as new, the armbands vie with the blue sky in purity! The laundry woman, smiling, quietly rubs her swollen hands: "Can I wash away some of the dirt from the world?"</p>

<h3>The Third Shanghai Basketball League Opens—Hopes for Each Team</h3>
<p>Just as the Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament ended, the Third Shanghai Basketball League followed closely. With the flourishing of Shanghai basketball teams and the dedication of the promoters, the number of participants in the men's and women's groups is very high, which is a good phenomenon in the basketball world. Currently, the league has already started the Group A and women's matches this week, and the Group B matches will be held after this competition is over. In terms of interest, it is completely concentrated at one time, which will inevitably create a phenomenon of early prosperity and later decline. The authorities must have taken such measures to concentrate their efforts, which is not to be criticized. Furthermore, it is understood that this time the divisions are Group A, Group A-B, Group B, and Women's Group, four groups; Group A-A has five teams, the Women's Group has ten teams, and the Group A-B and Group B teams are more numerous. The first two groups adopt a double round-robin system, which gives fans more opportunities to enjoy good games and also brings considerable benefits to their own income. Furthermore, it can be said that more games for good teams can indeed improve the level, achieving multiple goals with one move. The author cannot help but express great admiration for this year's league.</p>
<p>Regarding the participating teams, the Group A and Women's Group teams are largely the same as those in the Shenbao Cup. Taking advantage of the opening, it may be worthwhile to review and express hopes for the heroic teams in Group A and the Women's Group. As for Group A-B and Group B, we will discuss them when there is an opportunity.</p>
<h3>Group A-A: The Five Strongest Teams in Shanghai</h3>
<p>This time, those grouped into Group A-A are only five teams due to the scattered nature of the South China team. They are Zhongbei, Hualian, Wang Team, Renyu, and Jiashen. The above teams can be said to have collected almost all the top players in Shanghai. The name of the Group A-A team is still unfamiliar, but the players and their style are well known to the general public. The hopes for each team are described below:</p>
<p>Zhongbei: After losing to the Shan Team in the Shenbao Cup, its reputation almost fell apart. After overcoming the Hualian Team, the advantages of its Northern style once again emerged in the minds of fans, which is thought-provoking. In the author's opinion, there is no room for further improvement in the individual skills and experience of the team's players. However, there is indeed a need for further advancement in the team's tactics and the players' stamina. Looking at the game against Group A, for the above two points, it has gradually become more positive. In the past, their combat seemed to lack loyal strategy, but now it has been determined to use a man-to-man system. The stamina of each player is also gradually showing balanced progress. Furthermore, it is learned that Hua Ying Bao Songyuan has now also joined the team, greatly increasing its strength. If they can work hard as before, Zhongbei's performance will be beyond what we can imagine.</p>
<p>Hualian: The author expresses satisfaction with all aspects of the Hualian team. Their spirit of practice and research on tactics are especially commendable. Recently, the team's lineup may undergo significant changes. It seems that A Kong and Xilin have both become overweight, which is a significant disadvantage in terms of running speed. The most likely scenario is that Qinggong and Bo Tuo will try out as guards, while the forwards will still be very prominent, including Adi Xianlun Liangxiong Jiusheng, etc. In short, the team is full of talent, and adjustment is easy. With the wisdom and resourcefulness of Zhang Guixiang and Yan Youling, reaching the peak is to be expected.</p>
<p>Shan Team: I love the team's cooperative spirit, I admire the bravery of the team members. With these two merits, it is almost certain that a newly emerging team will be able to gain such achievements. What is lacking is still a lack of experience, which easily leads to inappropriate performances and no fixed results. This is not surprising, and there is no way to seek rectification in a short period of time. It is bound to be a part of the process, and it can be followed with time. The future of the Shan team is limitless. The hope is that they can work together and never change their minds.</p>
<p>Renyu: This is a team with a history, and its performance changes with the comings and goings of its members. However, the team can always maximize its strengths and sportsmanship under any circumstances. Joining the league this time, they will not focus on winning or losing, but will focus on promoting new talents in Shanghai. It is even more commendable that in the game against Hualian, the young players lived up to expectations, showing that they can train hard in a proper state at ordinary times to have this performance. The author has the greatest admiration for the team's spirit, not just looking at its record.</p>
<p>Jiashen: Since the team was just established, it is difficult to expect outstanding results. Moreover, the players all come from several teams, and cooperation cannot be tacit in a short period of time. Each player will rely on their own abilities and develop individually. Therefore, in the game against Zhongbei, they were also able to rely on each player to have a good situation. It is said that the team's authorities have high interest, and they have been practicing every day recently, so there may be a day to see each other with new eyes.</p>
<h3>Six Female Teams, Each with Their Own Strengths</h3>
<p>Lianyi: This is a new product of the Lianyi Sports Association, performing in a brand-new way. However, since it is a new army, the performance is still not ideal. Therefore, the ladies should not be discouraged by defeat, but go forward bravely. I am confident that the Lianyi Women's Basketball Team can have a future.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese: After the last basketball league, they have been inactive until now, and most of the team remains the same. It is found that the team members are healthy and have beautiful postures, which are unmatched by other teams. This time, there may not be an outstanding performance, but in terms of their physique and posture, they give us a satisfactory impression. It is hoped that the team will develop more in this regard.</p>
<p>Xuebai: Whether it is the forward and the defender or the tactics, all three have a good state of balanced progress. However, the individual skills are not yet pure, which easily leads to fouls. If they can pay special attention to this point, then what they gain can definitely exceed what ordinary people imagine.</p>
<p>Yikang: This team is a team with a coach, able to follow the rules and progress gradually. What is felt to be lacking is that it seems to be too formalized. The application of methods must strive to adapt to circumstances, so that it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. What does the team's coach think?</p>
<p>Sansheng: Because of the addition of new players such as Zhang Yue and Le Jashi, the team's performance is not weaker than before. It is generally believed that what is lacking is that the team has not been able to achieve contact and tacit understanding. Especially the guards are brave but lack strategy. If they can improve this, given the team members' strong physique, their success is to be expected.</p>
<p>Green Team: The team has a vibe of being invincible in Shanghai at the moment. This point is enough to prove that although the situation of women's basketball in Shanghai is enthusiastic, the level is actually still low. Therefore, the Green Team can never meet a team that is even slightly enough to compete with them. After all, there is no doubt that the Green Team will crush all the teams under the current situation. The team's shortcomings are the insufficient ability of the reserve personnel. If they can strive for perfection, then they will not lose the title of leader. One day they will go on expeditions to distant lands to show the power of the ladies in Shanghai, which is something to rely on.</p>
<p>In the women's group, the Green Team seems to be able to retain the championship. The strength of the remaining five teams is evenly matched, and there is a good opportunity for a double round-robin. A fierce competition will be added, and a lot of color can be added to the scene with the sounds of singing and talk.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Boxing Championship Tournament Held This Morning</h3>
<p>The highly anticipated Sino-Western Boxing Championship Tournament is scheduled to take place this morning (the 21st) at 10:45 AM at the Jai Alai Stadium. The sole reason for the delayed start time is to avoid a conflict with the football match scheduled for today. The extra fifteen minutes will allow football fans the opportunity to watch the football match and then come and enjoy the grand boxing tournament, the first of its kind this year.</p>
<p>The roster for the boxing match, after careful selection and a full medical examination by doctors, is formally announced as follows:</p>
<p>Fourteen Rounds: Caitantan Di versus Sam Liu Gu (three minutes per round)</p>
<p>Eight Rounds: Dan Li Duni versus Wen Nuo Gu (two minutes per round)</p>
<p>Eight Rounds: Luo Genstein versus Sai Weisuofu</p>
<p>Six Rounds: Li Peigen versus Weiduo</p>
<p>Six Rounds: Geluopifu versus Shi Weiya</p>
<p>Six Rounds: Xiao Mo versus Ya Ershifei</p>
<p>Four Rounds: Lin Zhongshou versus Xiang Hai</p>
<p>According to boxing fans who are generally experienced in boxing matters, Caitantan Di's boxing skills are excellent, with the surprise attacks and fierce lunges of the "First Seven" [Translator's Note: possibly a nickname or reference to a fighting style]. Combined with a calm mind, it seems that he is almost assured victory in this boxing match. However, Sam Liu Gu is no weakling either. He worked his way up from the bottom, eventually defeating the highest-ranked opponents. He possesses strength, wit, and courage, all of which are incredibly powerful. Therefore, Caitantan Di's future prospects are not necessarily optimistic. Dan Li Duni is a famous Italian warrior, and his fight against the German expatriate Wen Nuo Gu will truly be a battle between a dragon and a tiger, surely involving some extraordinary fierce fighting. Most noteworthy is the diligence of the Chinese boxer Li Peigen. He is never late, and often early, every morning, dedicating himself to practicing for an hour and a half. Such a spirit of hard work is rarely seen among boxers.</p>
<p>According to Li Peigen, he has declared to others that he is determined to defeat the Western expatriate in this boxing match and bring glory to the Chinese people. With such ambition and perseverance, he will surely succeed and achieve his desired goal. Another boxer, Lin Zhongfu, is also a promising and energetic young man.
