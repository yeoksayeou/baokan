<h3>首都平價維紀會輪廓（下）</h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>囤米者死</p>
<p>七項生活必需品中，是以米爲第一重要，所以視及點也大，該會成立，首先就修改了米糧統制辦法，解除城關封鎖，取消了食米入城八公斤的限量。並且要使供給京市食糧的附近江寗，句容，漂水，江浦，六合五縣，米源暢通無阻，甚至像安徽省的產米各縣，也准自由運京。而且把所有利用火車向上海各站跑單幫的米販或者軍警，一律取締，防止米糧不致因滬地價高而外流。</p>
<p>米價起初也以公正的評議，規定限價每石二萬元，後來三月八日重行改訂限價時，因尙待與有關方面商定而未曾公布，隨後就因黑市囂張而開放，變成隨時度勢決定了。</p>
<p>但是對意圖營利而囤積居奇，足以妨害供求關係的，不論宮民決依照戰時刑事特別法處以「死刑」。</p>
<p>至於柴草，除了二月一日起，由市府警憲三機關會同統一採購，按照實際人數，定量配給軍憲警隊部機關學校士兵和學生所需外，如果軍警仍有攔載需索情形，一經查獲，也以軍令處死刑。</p>
<p>還有附帶一提的，猪肉一項前因公營社的種種惡行，以致造成肉價飛漲，現在已停止了該社的活動，所有以前蓋印收費每隻一千六百元，也予以免除，准許自由入城販賣，所以最近猪肉價格反跌進限價，正是取締中飽機關所收的效果。</p>
<p>軍警的生活補助</p>
<p>爲了澈底協助抑平物價，安定首都的軍憲響生活，該會又規定了生活補助費的發給，並且隨了物似升降，分爲「最低生活補助費」和「直系親屬瞻養津貼」兩種，但是「直系親屬瞻養津貼」是祗限居京的本人的六十歲以上的父母祖父母配偶和求學期間的子女而言。</p>
<p>各軍憲警官佐的「最低生活補助費」一律每人每月發給八千三百三十五元。警士每名每月補助四千八百七十二元。憲兵每名每月補助七千五百十五元。士兵每名每月補助二千五百元。都是在本薪以外再補給的數目維持個人最低的生活。關於「直系親　瞻義津貼」，乃是不論官兵一律待遇，家族每一人，補助一萬元，三人以內仍作一人，四人至五人補助二萬元，六人以上補助三萬元，但以三萬允爲限。</p>
<p>以上婉定的補助費和津貼，是按照每月上旬的物價擬定的，物價漲落隨即變更，上面的數目，都是按照一月份上句物價所發給的。發放時是由點放組派混合組人員會同各該主管機關部隊學校當局，按照淸册點名發放，如有浮報情事，就要依法嚴刑。</p>
<p>維紀會目從開始已來，已經快將兩月，鑒於京市物價最近又呈漲勢，該會當局是不能不負起責任的，而且要從速設法打開種種難關，使得物價眞眞達到「因平而定」的地步，民生得解於倒懸始有希望，正如新任主任委員蕭叔宣氏在二十日所發表的談話，告訴我們要强化工作，那是全市民衆所拭目以待的。（完）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>平價米分派的調整</h3>
<p>關於平價米辦理經過，本報陳社長會於二十六日代論中，以參與其事的地位，作了一個報吿。說明平價米的意義，是補充一般配給及重點配給米之不足，藉以抑制黑市米價的上漲。配給的對象限於各業職工及低薪水階級。分派的數量，大致依照各界人數範圍規定各得若干單位。分派數量的決定，不過根據客覜的估計，當然未盡理想。而且經過了兩期實施分配以後，引起各方面對於分配問題的種種討淪，顯出不盡合理的反響。</p>
<p>爲什麼配給的對象，只限於各業職工及低薪水階級呢？據我們的觀察，因爲各業職工大都是薪給菲薄，生活困苦。這裏所謂各業職工當然是指薪給低者而言，　如在同一機構內的高級職員，雖也是職工之一，但薪給較高，與低薪水階級一原則不符，自應不在配給之列。同時，平價米的原意，是在低薪水階級受到實惠。如果在同一機構內較高薪給的也享受配給，就是減少了低薪給者的數量，減削了低薪級者的實惠。所以，我們主張不但同一機構內高薪級者不能與低薪級者同樣配給。而且在同一界內，同樣是低薪級者，也須分出低級之中的高低區別，而在分派數量上予以調整。譬如新聞文化一界中，新聞從業員及報販二戶，難同是低薪水階級，而兩者之間的一般比較，報販薪給更比新聞從業員爲低，而人數則新聞從業員較多，在比較斟酌之問決定以同樣數量配給。這樣的分配方法，就是根據平價米的原意與原則而決定的。至於在同一界之中，對於受配各個單位之決定，也須顧到戰時國家社會所盡的義務及職工薪給高低等原則。應如新聞文化界內，所列的新聞從業員，期刊雜誌等九個單位，當然不是完全包括新聞文化界。因爲這幾個單位比較多盡些戰時宣傳的義務。譬如銀行界中凡是銀行都有列入單位的資格，中央儲備銀行也屬銀行界，可是，因爲中儲是國家銀行，職員薪給較高，且有特種配給，就不予列入。這樣的分配辦法，也就適合於平價米的原意與原則了。</p>
<p>本月二十四日大陸新報載有「同業公會與平價米」一文，（見今日本報第二版）對於同業公會的配給方法加以批評，我們認爲有相當理由，公會分派方法也就是忽略了上面所講的原意與原則所致。所以，應該顧到公會會員的性質，對於戰時國家社會盡了怎樣的義務。顧到公會會員的人數，顧到公會會員職工的薪給，然後加以決定分派數量，比較合理。</p>
<p>過去的姑置不論，今後平價米的分派，希望各界應充分顧到平價米的原意與原則，考慮合理的調整辦法，俾使貢獻於戰時國家社會的低薪水階級充分得到實惠。</p>

<p>美軍需品產量大減　美國軍需物資之生產量，去年十月以來，極形低減，對於歐洲戰塲軍需品之供給，殊爲缺乏。艾森霍華將軍曾一再向國內要求增產，以應亟需。至軍需物資之所以缺乏，其原因有二：一·爲供給系不足，工資低減，軍需產業已改爲民需品之製造。二·爲需求增加，此點在艾森霍華之報吿書中可以見之。歐洲戰塲上所需要之小型火器如機槍步槍等，其需要量比較以前預計者增加四倍，日砲增加一倍，其他彈藥燃料衣料葉品等等，均較從前之需要量增加多多。美國軍需物資之缺乏，其最嚴重時期爲去年十月及十一月，眾需之生產量，只能達需要量之百分之六十八。生產方面比較多之重火器生產量，達其需要量之百份之六十四，即不足三成半有餘，載重卡車不一足百分之三十一，戰車缺乏乏百分之三十五，以上均係根據美國陸軍補給部部長森瑪維爾十一月二十一日所發表者而言。嗣後其生產量雖涵吿上昇，但截至本年三月二十日根據其發表之數字，美國陸海軍方面之軍需物資，其剩貨已完全用罄，而其生產能力則已臻最高峰，故最近美國己採取軍需物資由製造工廠，直接運往戰塲之口號。近來美軍在歐洲及東亞方面之軍需品消耗，爲量殊鉅，故益感其缺乏矣。</p>
<p>主要食品大感不足　次爲美國民生活之窘狀，其主要食品之小麥，去年遭從來未有之數收，故按照人口與產量之支配，每人勢將減少百分之二十。政府方面，因而提倡民間多食山芋。去年每一美國民之牛肉消耗量平均爲一百四十七磅，（較英人多四十磅）但因去年生產量減低二十萬萬磅，今年每一國民之牛肉消耗量，必大爲減低。紐約市之牛肉舖，有政府規定之官價，而據三月廿二日外電稱，其出售之牛肉百分之九十，係按照黑市價格。奶油產量更形不足，其缺乏情形爲七直地年以來所未有，民間之消耗已受到對之限制。砂糖因南部各地甘蔗，遭受風災，（包括巴西在內）產量大遜，今年民間消耗量亦將大受限制。棉布棉紗美國向來對外輸出，但今年情形不同，民問之襯衫配給量，巳減低至百分之六十，手巾減至白分之五十。汽車車胎今年之生產額的爲一千八百萬個，而其實際需要量則爲四千八百萬個。烟草生產亦感不足，即向以烟葉生產聞名之北卡洛立那亦然，故市間購買香烟，大惑困難，在羅斯福總統白宮內服務之職員，購買香烟時，亦須排隊鵠立，其他可想。海外遠征軍軍士之香烟配給量，同樣減少，駐屯巴黎之美軍，每購本國出產之香烟一包，須費美金四元八角，與黑市價格相等，非直接之戰鬥部隊，如軍需，看護，維重，及交通隊等，均巳停止供給香烟。政府方面因財政困難，推銷公債，無孔不入，無論人民購買香烟火柴，甚至看足球或棒球，均須搭購公債。</p>
<p>國民道德墮落一斑　最後爲國民道德標準之墮落，由於生活壓迫，墨市賣買，偷竊詐欺等罪行，較前增多。最顯著者爲汽油及火車票之黑市，尤其受到市民之指賣，各地犯罪案件，普遍增多，其中婦人犯罪，更爲激增，較平時多出百分之一百四十五，犯罪者之年齡以靑年十七歲左右者爲最多，結婚者雖多，離婚案亦不少。據去年支加哥民事裁判所統計，一年中之離婚案爲一萬五千件，實佔結婚者半數，美國國民道德之墮落，可覘一斑。</p>

<p>姜次長談來滬任務</p>
<p>美實業部次長昨日在滬接見記者談稱：本人此次來滬，除當局主持今日召開之工商企業調查委員會第三次全體委議外，其最要之任務乃爲與本市實業界及有關各方商討疏通煤觔運輸問題，挽救工業危機。查目前滬市工業生產，陷於停頓，其主要因素，係於動力困難，蓋以煤觔來源缺乏，然就各地煤產地區而言，現竟有十二處爍產地區，存煤山積，但受交通運輸影響，致不能啓運來滬。即以首郡附近之龍潭煤鑛生產景觀之，最近存煤達四千噸以上，此外如饅頭山，下罰以及淮南等，其存量更堪驚人。本人此來擬積極設法，使該項煤觔迅速疏通運滬，接濟工廠業之急需。至策進工業之發展問題，本部工業司唐司長於日前已到滬，與工商界領袖有所連絡。</p>

<p>解除民生痛苦！</p>
<h3>同業公會與平價米</h3>
<p>— 揚子江人</p>
<p>第二次的平價米，業已配給完了。據中國朋友說，所謂平價米，就是按購買的價格，並不加上任何商業利潤而出賣的米。正當戶口米停止配給的時侯，尤其正當追求米糧　利毫無止境的時候，而竟開始配給平價米，數量雖少，範圍雖仄，但對於嗷嗷待哺的民衆說，總不失爲一大福音。</p>
<p>平價米的來源，就是江蘇省的田賦。苦惱於米價　騰不止的市政府和市民，即以羅君强·李思浩·陳彬龢爲代表，便開始交涉江蘇的田賦米廉價轉賣給上海市政府。江蘇省當局對於這一要求，本着「爲推進好的上海市政」這種精神上的希望，而立刻允諾，便締結十萬石的買賣契約。現在每石三萬七千元廉價出賣的平價米，就是這十萬石之中的一部份。希望「爲推進好的上海市政」，這不僅是江蘇省指導者的希望，而且也是上海四百萬市民的祈求。不用說十萬石，不過是杯水車薪，無濟於事。但每一個市民都應切身知道，在現在這樣千鈞一髮的危險時局下，取得一粒米糧是要經過幾許困苦奮鬥的，所以不應嫌少而應加重視的。爲求好的政治，則必先求好的配給，但市政府委託市商會所辦的平價米配給，是否可以說是用好的方法辦理的呢？</p>
<p>慈善團體和文化機關，全都領到平價米的配給。但主要配給的對象，却是各個同業公會。同業公會的使命和力量，固然無可厚非，對於國家社會都有其一定的貢獻，但大小公會或輕重不等的公會，全都一視同仁地得到寶貴平價米的配給，這實在不能令人贊同。只要讀讀報紙上的廣告就該明瞭，浴堂業公會，廣告業公會，股票肩客公會，茶館公會，迷信物品業公會等等，不一而足的組織，全對於大東亞戰爭毫無供獻，全對於民生安定毫無足輕重，這同樣也得到一份同量的公會平價米配給，眞是令人不解，且令人涕笑皆非。日前一位中國朋友說：「我和一位朋友去洗澡曾費了八千元。」在米珠薪桂的今天，到浴堂去舒服地讓浴堂裏的「老三老四」擦擦背的上海佬，能有幾人呢？市商會對於無關重要的許多公會，廉價配給平價米，反而對於供職於戰時重要機關的職工擺架子打官腔，這更是咄咄怪事！</p>
<p>市政府經濟局最近曾一再聲明，將斷然整頓同業公會。但對於目前民生毫無關係的同業公會，竟大施恩德配給以平價米這一事實，豈不是當局的聲明等於白紙黑字的具文麼？凡是對於戰爭民生流汗落淚者，都應首先得到米，這是我們的主張。（譯自三月廿四日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>戰時民衆代表大會　本市代表談話　提案三件供政府採納</h3>
<p>各省市戰時民衆代表大會，已決定於三月二十八日在首都舉行，本市代表爲袁履登，陳彬龢，陳日平，周越然四氏，除陳彬龢氏因事不及赴京參加外，其餘三氏昨由中央社記者走訪，承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>袁履登談</p>
<p>欣聞首都各界民衆，　目時艱，有各省市民衆在京　　民衆代表會議，以期　合民意，共商國是，供獻政府之採納。是以滬區有四代表出席，履登俄推　爲　一，茲應中央社記者徵詢意見，履登以在商言商，謹就滬市工商界方面之一般意見，簡略言之。（一）交通方面：希望運輸暢　，俾使物資圓滑流通。（二）　食方面：希望滬市四郊糧食菜蔬盡量流入並矚望戶口米能按期配給。（三）日用品方面：希望統制機構，就可能範圍內，着重設想市民生活必需品普遍增加。（四）生產方面：滬市工廠商號，希望原料充沛，增加電力供給，俾製造商品輸入農村，而使農產品流入都市。於是，通貨運用圓滑，則非特物價可以抑平，民生得以安定，而於生產建國，有莫大期望焉。</p>
<p>陳日平談</p>
<p>查上海原爲工商業地區，人口衆多，而糧食供應，向賴各方，當茲戰局日益劇烈之際，萬一交通受阻，糧運不濟，而發生種種問題，實在重要。上海特別市政府有鑒於此，特設立人口疏散委員會，現已積極推行其事，本人代表出席此次民衆大會，擬就此略述意見。</p>
<p>爲期本市人口疏散工作圓滑推進起見，深盼各有關當局，與毘鄰省市，加以協助，俾得實現。即（一）容納地區內治安及糧食兩項，希澈底確保。其次被疏散者之事業問題，予以便利，使安生計。（二）關於交通工具，如鐵道·船舶·車輛等之準備及聯絡，希當局與有關各方予以協助，俾利進行。</p>
<p>此外，復盼民衆本身對疏散工作自動協力，使在官民合作下，本市疏散工作得以順利進行。</p>
<p>周越然談</p>
<p>對於此次民衆代表大會，我抱有極大的希望，我雖然是個年已六旬，且「手無縛鷄之力」者，但也應該爲國家用些心思，况且我已經很榮譽地被推爲上海四代表之一。</p>
<p>我們四人在接到市府逾知後，即於二十五日中午，趁便餐之際，會面談叙。我們當時所講的，無非是對於大會的希望。我們希望『全面和平』，我們希望『決戰勝利』……我們的希望大得很，多得很！但是後來想到三件事情，想到與上海有關的三件大事情，似非各提一案不可。（一）民食，（二）工業，（三）疏散。關於民食，我們想請政府疏通來源。關於工業，我們想請政府恢復電流。關於疏散，我們想請政府加以保護。各件議案，起草已經完成，因爲文字甚長，又因爲尙未提出，我不便全錄於此。</p>
<p>這三件議案，恐怕不能提出了，——我們要失望了。我們今天（二十七日）一早（八時前）就到車站，在那邊坐了十幾分鐘，知道快車不開，我們想改趁夜車，但是到此刻（二十七日下午三時）爲止，車票還沒購到，恐怕不能動身了，——恐怕趕不上大會了。開會有一定的時日，當然不能等待我們。倘然我們眞的不能成行，那末我們不能提案，不能討論。我們的希望化爲烏有——我們失望！</p>
<h3>市敎局懲罰　朦領特配米</h3>
<p>本市各公私立學校敎職員工，經市政當局核發重點配米，原在使該項工作人員，生活安定，藉以增進工作效率，同時爲杜絕浮員計，故規定兼職之敎職員，祗准在一校領取，倘有朦領二校配米，一經查出，當將各該有關學校，予以全部停配食米之處分。近經物品配給處查得敎員數人兼領配米，已將各該人員，先停止特配一月，以示懲儆。又有樹民中學敎員范志宣，捏造偽名虛報年歲及市民證號數，分別兼領配米，經敎育局查出，奉諭已移送警局究辦。</p>

<h3>Delegates' Congress of People from Various Provinces and Cities Opens in the Capital This Morning; New Page Begins in the History of the National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The significance of the National Government's return to the capital lies in the renewed departure of the consistent spirit of the National Revolution, in order to achieve the overall harvest in the history of the National Revolution. Over the past five years, the correctness of the path of peaceful unification has been gradually proven. At present, a main body of peaceful unification has been established domestically, and a main force of independent freedom has been completed externally. At the beginning of this first major year of the return to the capital, it is precisely when the Greater East Asia War enters its final decisive stage. In order for us to complete the great mission of China's revitalization and East Asia's liberation, we must advance courageously with the total strength of the whole country.

The conference is now scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th at the National Assembly Hall. Our entire country deeply anticipates this conference, unanimously believing that this conference is a landmark development in the history of our national salvation movement and has profound significance. The representatives will, based on stimulating national and ethnic consciousness, promoting our country's traditional culture, opposing aggression, opposing separatism, and opposing communism, carefully study the current internal and external situation, and contribute their thoughts, in order to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy as soon as possible, complete the era's mission of the National Revolution, and build a Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People.

<h3>Chairman Wang Yintai of the North China Political Affairs Commission Arrives in Beijing; Makes a Statement to Newspaper Reporters</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Chairman Wang Yintai of the North China Political Affairs Commission arrived in Beijing by plane from Beiping at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning. Central government officials who welcomed him at the airport included Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and National Government officials.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang made the following statement to reporters: Since taking office, Yintai has briefly arranged various affairs. Today, I personally enter the capital to pay respects to Acting Chairman Chen and seek advice, and report on the political situation to the central government. I have been in office for many years and deeply regret that I have not made any achievements. This time, I am again ordered by the central government to take charge of political affairs in the north. Looking around at the country's difficulties, I feel even more the importance of my responsibility. Unifying, peace, and reviving the motherland are the common goals of the Chinese people. To achieve this goal, we must stand firm, recognize the direction, be sincere and diligent, and move forward independently. If we can reawaken the youthful national innovation spirit, I am confident that all difficult situations can be overcome, and all construction problems will naturally be eliminated. At this critical time, we especially rely on compatriots from all sides to shoulder the mission of saving the country.</p>
<h3>Students Suspend Classes to Engage in Production Work</h3>
<p>Beiping, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to adapt to the extraordinary wartime educational system measures decided by the Japanese cabinet meeting, classes for Japanese students at all universities and specialized schools have been suspended for one year starting from April 1st. The students have organized labor service teams to engage in the increased production of food and military supplies and to devote themselves to air defense work.</p>

<h3>Outline of the Capital's Price Stabilization and Discipline Enforcement Committee (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ren Ping</p>
<p>Hoarding Rice is Punishable by Death</p>
<p>Among the seven essential necessities of life, rice is the most important, so the attention paid to it is also greater. After the establishment of the committee, the first thing it did was to revise the rice control measures, lift the blockade of the city gates, and abolish the limit of eight kilograms of rice allowed to enter the city. Moreover, it wanted to ensure that the rice sources in the five nearby counties of Jiangning, Jurong, Piaoshui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, which supply food to the capital, were unobstructed, and even counties in Anhui Province that produce rice were allowed to transport it to the capital freely. Moreover, all rice peddlers or military police who used trains to run singlehandedly to various stations in Shanghai were banned to prevent rice from flowing out due to the high prices in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Initially, the rice price was also fairly evaluated, and the price limit was set at 20,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). Later, when the price limit was revised again on March 8, it was not announced because it was still awaiting negotiation with relevant parties, and then it was opened due to the rampant black market, becoming a decision based on the situation at any time.</p>
<p>However, anyone who intends to profit by hoarding and speculation, which is sufficient to hinder the relationship between supply and demand, whether official or civilian, will be punished with the "death penalty" in accordance with the Special Criminal Law during wartime.</p>
<p>As for firewood, in addition to the unified purchase by the city government, police, and military police three agencies, which began on February 1, and the quantitative distribution according to the actual number of people to meet the needs of military, police, and military police teams, government agencies, schools, soldiers, and students, if military police still intercept and demand firewood, once discovered, they will also be executed by military order.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that the public-operated company's various malpractices previously caused the price of pork to skyrocket. Now the company's activities have been stopped, and all previous fees of 1,600 yuan per pig for stamping and charging have been waived, allowing free entry into the city for sale. Therefore, the recent decline in pork prices to below the price limit is precisely the effect of eliminating agencies that enrich themselves.</p>
<p>Living Allowance for Military Police</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly assist in suppressing prices and stabilizing the lives of military police in the capital, the committee also stipulated the issuance of living allowances, and, with the rise and fall of prices, divided them into two types: "minimum living allowance" and "allowance for supporting direct relatives." However, the "allowance for supporting direct relatives" is limited to the recipient's parents, grandparents, spouse, and children in school who are over 60 years old and reside in the capital.</p>
<p>The "minimum living allowance" for all military police officers is uniformly 8,335 yuan per person per month. Police officers are subsidized 4,872 yuan per person per month. Military police are subsidized 7,515 yuan per person per month. Soldiers are subsidized 2,500 yuan per person per month. These are all amounts supplemented in addition to the base salary to maintain the individual's minimum living standard. Regarding the "allowance for supporting direct relatives," all officers and soldiers are treated equally. Each family member is subsidized 10,000 yuan. Three or fewer family members are counted as one person, four to five family members are subsidized 20,000 yuan, and six or more family members are subsidized 30,000 yuan, but the maximum is 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned allowances and subsidies were determined based on the prices in the first ten days of each month. The prices change with price fluctuations. The numbers above are all the amounts issued according to the prices in the first ten days of January. When issuing the allowances, the distribution team sends a mixed team of personnel to work with the competent authorities, troops, and school authorities to distribute them by name according to the register. If there is any fraudulent reporting, it will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization and Discipline Enforcement Committee has been in operation for almost two months since its inception. In view of the recent upward trend in prices in the capital, the committee authorities cannot but bear the responsibility, and must quickly find ways to overcome various difficulties so that prices can truly reach the point of being "stabilized by suppression." Only when the people's livelihood is rescued from dire straits will there be hope, just as the newly appointed chairman, Xiao Shuxuan, said in his speech on the 20th, telling us to strengthen our work, which is what the entire city's people are looking forward to.

<h3>Adjusting the Distribution of Fair-Price Rice</h3>
<p>Regarding the process of handling fair-price rice, Chen, the president of this newspaper, made a report on the 26th in a substitute commentary from the position of someone who participated in it. It explained that the significance of fair-price rice is to supplement the inadequacy of general ration and key ration rice, so as to suppress the rise in black market rice prices. The target of the ration is limited to workers in various industries and low-salary classes. The amount of distribution is roughly determined according to the number of people in each sector, with each sector receiving a certain number of units. The decision on the distribution amount is only based on objective estimates, and is of course not entirely ideal. Moreover, after two periods of implementation and distribution, various discussions on the distribution issue have been aroused in various aspects, revealing reactions that are not entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>Why is the target of the ration limited to workers in various industries and low-salary classes? According to our observation, it is because most workers in various industries have meager salaries and difficult lives. The so-called workers in various industries here of course refer to those with low salaries. For example, senior staff in the same institution, although also workers, have higher salaries and do not conform to the principle of being in the low-salary class, and should naturally not be included in the ration. At the same time, the original intention of fair-price rice is to benefit the low-salary class. If those with higher salaries in the same institution also enjoy the ration, it reduces the number of low-salary earners and reduces the benefits for the low-salary class. Therefore, we advocate that not only should those with higher salaries in the same institution not be given the same ration as those with lower salaries, but also that in the same sector, those who are equally low-salary earners should also be divided into higher and lower levels within the lower class, and the distribution amount should be adjusted accordingly. For example, in the news and culture sector, news employees and newspaper vendors are both low-salary classes, but in general comparison between the two, newspaper vendors' salaries are even lower than those of news employees, while the number of news employees is larger. In comparing and considering the two, the decision is made to distribute the same amount. This distribution method is based on the original intention and principles of fair-price rice. As for the decision of each unit to receive the ration within the same sector, it is also necessary to consider the obligations to the wartime state and society and the principle of high and low salaries of employees. For example, the nine units listed in the news and culture sector, such as news employees and periodicals, are of course not fully inclusive of the news and culture sector. This is because these units generally fulfill more wartime propaganda obligations. For example, in the banking sector, all banks are qualified to be included in the unit, and the Central Reserve Bank also belongs to the banking sector. However, because the Central Reserve Bank is a state bank, the salaries of its employees are higher, and there is a special ration, it is not included. This distribution method is also in line with the original intention and principles of fair-price rice.</p>
<p>The "Industry Associations and Fair-Price Rice" article published in the Continental News on the 24th of this month (see page two of today's newspaper) criticizes the industry associations' distribution method. We believe there is considerable reason for this. The industry associations' distribution method also neglects the original intention and principles mentioned above. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the nature of the industry association members and what kind of obligations they have fulfilled to the wartime state and society. It is necessary to consider the number of industry association members and the salaries of their employees, and then decide on the distribution amount, which is more reasonable.</p>
<p>Let us put the past aside for the time being. In the future distribution of fair-price rice, it is hoped that all sectors will fully consider the original intention and principles of fair-price rice and consider reasonable adjustment methods, so that the low-salary classes who contribute to the wartime state and society can fully benefit.</p>

<h3>Insufficient Supply of Enemy American Military Supplies Leads to Sharp Production Decline; Director Matsudaira Discusses American Material Panic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference yesterday afternoon. Director of Public Relations Matsudaira explained the situation within the United States, elaborating in detail on the decline of military supplies, the impoverishment of national life, and the degradation of moral standards. The gist of his statement is recorded below:</p>
<p>**Sharp Decline in American Military Production** Since October of last year, the production of American military supplies has decreased dramatically, resulting in a severe shortage of supplies for the European theater. General Eisenhower has repeatedly requested increased production from the domestic front to meet urgent needs. There are two reasons for this shortage of military supplies: First, the supply system is insufficient, wages have decreased, and military industries have shifted to the manufacture of civilian goods. Second, demand has increased, as can be seen in Eisenhower's report. The demand for small arms such as machine guns and rifles in the European theater has increased fourfold compared to previous estimates, artillery has doubled, and other ammunition, fuel, clothing, and other supplies have increased significantly. The most severe period of the American military supply shortage was in October and November of last year. Production could only meet 68% of demand. Heavy weapons production, which was relatively higher, only reached 64% of demand, leaving a shortfall of more than 35%. Heavy trucks only reached 31%, and tanks were short by 35%. The above figures are based on the announcement made by Secretary of the Army Supply Somerville on November 21st. Although production has reportedly increased since then, according to figures released as of March 20th of this year, the US Army and Navy have completely exhausted their stockpiles of military supplies, and their production capacity has reached its peak. Therefore, the United States has recently adopted the slogan of shipping military supplies directly from factories to the battlefield. Recent consumption of American military supplies in Europe and East Asia has been enormous, further exacerbating the shortage.</p>
<p>**Major Food Shortages** Secondly, regarding the plight of American civilian life, the main food crop, wheat, suffered an unprecedented harvest failure last year. Therefore, based on the distribution of population and production, each person will inevitably consume 20% less. Consequently, the government is promoting the consumption of sweet potatoes among the public. Last year, the average beef consumption per American citizen was 147 pounds (40 pounds more than the British). However, due to a reduction in production of 200 million pounds last year, this year's beef consumption per citizen will inevitably decrease significantly. New York City's butcher shops have officially set prices regulated by the government. However, according to a foreign dispatch dated March 22nd, 90% of the beef sold is at black market prices. Butter production is even more insufficient, with a shortage unseen in the past seven years. Public consumption has been restricted. Sugar production has been greatly reduced due to sugarcane crops in southern regions (including Brazil) suffering from typhoons, and public consumption will also be severely restricted this year. The United States has traditionally exported cotton cloth and yarn, but this year is different. The civilian allocation of shirts has been reduced to 60%, and towels to 50%. The production of automobile tires this year is estimated at 18 million, while the actual demand is 48 million. Tobacco production is also insufficient, even in North Carolina, which is famous for its tobacco production. Therefore, it is very difficult to buy cigarettes in the market. Even the staff serving President Roosevelt in the White House must queue up when buying cigarettes, which is indicative of the situation. The cigarette ration for overseas expeditionary force soldiers has also been reduced. American soldiers stationed in Paris must pay US$4.80 for a pack of domestically produced cigarettes, equivalent to the black market price. Non-direct combat units, such as supply, nursing, maintenance, and transportation units, have all had their cigarette supplies discontinued. Due to financial difficulties, the government is aggressively promoting the sale of public bonds, leaving no avenue unexplored. Whether people buy cigarettes, matches, or even watch football or baseball games, they must also purchase public bonds.</p>
<p>**Glimpse of National Moral Decay** Finally, regarding the decline of national moral standards, due to the pressure of life, crimes such as black market trading, theft, and fraud have increased compared to before. The most obvious are the black markets for gasoline and train tickets, which are particularly criticized by citizens. Crime rates have generally increased in various regions, with a particularly sharp increase in female crime, more than 145% higher than usual. The age of offenders is mostly around 17 years old. Although marriages are numerous, divorce cases are also not uncommon. According to statistics from the Chicago Civil Court last year, there were 15,000 divorce cases in a year, accounting for half of the marriages. A glimpse of the decay of American national morality can be seen.</p>

<h3>Committee on Industry and Commerce Holds Third General Meeting Yesterday; Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Attends and Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>The Committee on Industry and Commerce Investigation held its third plenary committee meeting yesterday, the 27th, at the China Industrial Association on Wuyuan Road. Attendees included Chairman Jiang Zuoyi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and committee members Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiang, Liu Xingchen, Dai Lu, Li Zuying, and Mai Jingming. The meeting began with an opening address by Chairman and Vice Minister Jiang, followed by a report from Secretary Chen on the past work of the committee. Finally, key proposals for future work were discussed and resolved as follows: (1) To jointly formulate countermeasures with the Office of Exchange Supervisors and the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange authorities to improve the Chinese stock market. (2) To investigate the organizational structure, management personnel, and economic status of industry associations in various industries, requesting assistance from the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (3) To investigate the content of department stores and trading companies in Shanghai.</p>
<p>**Vice Minister Jiang Discusses Mission in Shanghai**</p>
<p>The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Jiang, met with reporters in Shanghai yesterday and stated: In addition to chairing the third plenary meeting of the Committee on Industry and Commerce Investigation convened by the authorities today, his most important mission is to discuss and communicate with the local industrial sector and relevant parties to address the coal transportation problem and avert an industrial crisis. Currently, industrial production in Shanghai is at a standstill, primarily due to power shortages caused by a lack of coal supply. However, in various coal-producing regions, there are currently twelve coal-producing areas with accumulated coal reserves, but transportation difficulties prevent them from being shipped to Shanghai. For example, the Longtan Coal Mine near the capital has recently stored over 4,000 tons of coal. Furthermore, reserves at Mantoushan, Xiafa, and Huainan are even more staggering. He intends to actively find ways to expedite the transport of this coal to Shanghai to meet the urgent needs of factories. Regarding the issue of promoting industrial development, Director Tang of the Industrial Department of the Ministry arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and has been in contact with leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<h3>Speech Meeting Held to Commemorate the Return to the Capital; Jointly Organized by Three Local Organizations</h3>

<h3>Police Department Adjusts Affairs of Various Agencies</h3>
<p>In order to refresh police administration, the Shanghai Police Department has adjusted its organizational structure and personnel. The original Accounting Office has been abolished, and all accounting affairs have been transferred to the Accounting Section of the First Department. Subsequently, police salaries will be issued by the Accounting Section. Furthermore, the free rice rations for police officers, which were previously handled by the Personnel Section of the First Department, are now to be managed by the newly reorganized Police Welfare Society. Therefore, it has been ordered that the Police Welfare Society take over these affairs, and all police welfare matters will henceforth be handled by the Police Welfare Society.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Luo to Broadcast Tonight</h3>
<p>This month, the 30th, marks the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital.

<p>In order to streamline operations and improve efficiency, the Cotton Control Committee of the Trade Control Council has decided to adjust its subordinate organizations and refresh its internal structure. The names of the Temporary Management Committee for Cotton Cloth and the Cotton Buying Industry Association will no longer be used, and the above two committees will be directly placed under the Cotton Industry Committee.

<h3>Zhou Chunyu Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment for Bribery; Deprived of Civil Rights and Confiscation of Bribes</h3>
<p>Zhou Chunyu, the chief secretary of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, was found by Allied military police authorities to have accepted bribes from rice merchants in August of last year by abusing his position and acting against his duties. He was reported, transferred to the city prosecutor's office for questioning, and found to be true. He was transferred to the local court in the city, and after a collegiate court hearing, the verdict was reached on the morning of the 27th. The main text: Zhou Chunyu is sentenced to five years imprisonment for continuous acceptance of bribes in violation of his duties, deprived of civil rights for life, and the confiscated gold bar, ten gold nuggets, and bribe money of 1.5 million yuan are confiscated. If all or part of the confiscation is not obeyed, the remaining amount will be recovered.</p>
<h3>County Administration Strictly Prohibits Gambling in Shanghai Suburbs</h3>
<p>Recently, gambling has become rampant in the suburban counties of Shanghai, involving tens of thousands of yuan, and some cunning individuals have organized so-called "silver groups" to issue illegal "Shen Orders" as chips, replacing cash and ledger accounts, especially in areas such as Chuansha and Nanhui. Upon receiving a definite report, the Shanghai Municipal County Administration issued a strict order to the governments of the various counties yesterday to strictly prohibit gambling and investigate and punish the main members of the "silver groups" who issued "Shen Orders."</p>
<p>Relieve People's Suffering!</p>
<h3>Trade Associations and Affordable Rice</h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang Ren</p>
<p>The second round of affordable rice distribution has been completed. According to Chinese friends, so-called "affordable rice" is rice sold at the purchase price without adding any commercial profit. Especially at a time when household rice rationing has stopped and the pursuit of profits from rice is endless, the distribution of affordable rice, even in small quantities and limited scope, is undoubtedly a great boon for the starving people.</p>
<p>The source of the affordable rice is the agricultural tax in Jiangsu Province. Distressed by the ever-rising rice prices, the municipal government and citizens, represented by Luo Junqiang, Li Sihao, and Chen Binhe, began negotiations with Jiangsu Province to cheaply resell the agricultural tax rice to the Shanghai municipal government. The Jiangsu Provincial authorities, based on the spirit of "promoting good Shanghai municipal administration," immediately agreed and concluded a contract for the sale of 100,000 *shi* of rice. The affordable rice currently sold at a low price of 37,000 yuan per *shi* is part of these 100,000 *shi*. The hope of "promoting good Shanghai municipal administration" is not only the hope of the leaders of Jiangsu Province, but also the prayer of the four million citizens of Shanghai. Needless to say, 100,000 *shi* is just a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. However, every citizen should personally know that in such a critical and dangerous situation, obtaining even a grain of rice requires much hardship and struggle, so they should not dislike it for being too little but should value it. To seek good politics, one must first seek good distribution. However, can it be said that the affordable rice distribution entrusted by the municipal government to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is being handled in a good way?</p>
<p>Charitable organizations and cultural institutions have all received affordable rice rations. However, the main recipients of the rations are the various trade associations. The mission and strength of trade associations are undoubtedly undeniable, and they have made certain contributions to the country and society. However, it is really impossible to agree that all trade associations, regardless of their size or importance, should receive the precious affordable rice rations equally. Just reading the advertisements in the newspapers should make it clear that organizations such as the Bathhouse Trade Association, the Advertising Trade Association, the Stock Brokers Association, the Teahouse Association, and the Superstitious Items Trade Association, etc., are all contributing nothing to the Greater East Asia War and are of no importance to the stability of people's livelihood. That these same organizations also receive a quantity of affordable rice rations equal to that of others is really incomprehensible and even laughable. A Chinese friend said the other day, "It cost me and a friend 8,000 yuan to take a bath." In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, how many Shanghailanders can afford to go to the bathhouse and comfortably have the "old men" and "old women" inside rub their backs? It is even more strange that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, while giving cheap affordable rice rations to many unimportant trade associations, puts on airs and acts officially towards the employees of wartime-important organizations!</p>
<p>The Economic Bureau of the Municipal Government has recently repeatedly stated that it will resolutely rectify trade associations. But the fact that it is generously distributing affordable rice to trade associations that are currently unrelated to people's livelihood, is this not the same as the authorities' statement being just empty words on paper? All those who sweat and cry for the war and people's livelihood should be the first to receive rice, that is our claim. (Translated from the Continental News, March 24)</p>
<h3>Talks by Shanghai Representatives at the Wartime People's Congress; Three Proposals for Government Adoption</h3>
<p>The Provincial and Municipal Wartime People's Congress is scheduled to be held in the capital on March 28. The Shanghai representatives are Yuan Ludeng, Chen Binhe, Chen Riping, and Zhou Yueran. Except for Chen Binhe, who could not attend due to circumstances, the remaining three were interviewed by reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>**Yuan Ludeng's Remarks**</p>
<p>I am pleased to hear that the people of the capital are aware of the current difficulties and that representatives from the provinces and cities are meeting in Beijing to gather public opinion, discuss national affairs, and contribute to the government's adoption. Therefore, four representatives from Shanghai are attending, and I, Ludeng, was honored to be one of them. In response to the Central News Agency reporter's request for my opinion, I, speaking as a businessman, would like to briefly mention the general opinions of the Shanghai industrial and commercial community. (1) In terms of transportation: I hope that transportation will be smooth so that materials can flow smoothly. (2) In terms of food: I hope that food and vegetables from the suburbs of Shanghai will flow in as much as possible, and I hope that household rice can be rationed on time. (3) In terms of daily necessities: I hope that the control organizations will focus on increasing the availability of daily necessities for citizens within the possible range. (4) In terms of production: Shanghai industrial and commercial enterprises hope to have sufficient raw materials and increased electricity supply so that manufactured goods can be imported into rural areas and agricultural products can flow into cities. In this way, the use of currency will be smooth, which will not only suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, but also greatly contribute to production and national construction.</p>
<p>**Chen Riping's Remarks**</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally an industrial and commercial area with a large population, and its food supply has always depended on various sources. At a time when the war is becoming increasingly fierce, if transportation is blocked and food transport is not smooth, various problems will arise, which is really important. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, in view of this, has specifically established a Population Evacuation Committee, which is now actively promoting its work. I will briefly state my opinion on this matter as a representative attending this People's Congress.</p>
<p>In order to smoothly promote the population evacuation work in this city, I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities will provide assistance to neighboring provinces and cities so that it can be realized. That is, (1) the security and food of the receiving areas should be thoroughly ensured. Secondly, the business problems of those being evacuated should be facilitated so that they can make a living. (2) Regarding transportation, such as railways, ships, and vehicles, I hope that the authorities and relevant parties will provide assistance to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>In addition, I also hope that the public will automatically cooperate with the evacuation work so that the evacuation work in this city can be carried out smoothly with the cooperation of the government and the people.</p>
<p>**Zhou Yueran's Remarks**</p>
<p>I have great hopes for this People's Congress. Although I am already sixty years old and have "no power to truss a chicken," I should also use some thoughts for the country, and I have already been very honorably elected as one of the four representatives of Shanghai.</p>
<p>After receiving the notification from the municipal government, the four of us met for dinner on the 25th to discuss the matter. What we talked about at that time was nothing more than our hopes for the congress. We hope for "overall peace," we hope for "victory in the final battle"... Our hopes are very big, very many! But later, we thought of three things, three major things related to Shanghai, that it seemed necessary to propose a motion for each. (1) People's food, (2) industry, (3) evacuation. Regarding people's food, we want to ask the government to dredge the source. Regarding industry, we want to ask the government to restore the current. Regarding evacuation, we want to ask the government to protect it. The drafting of each motion has been completed, but because the text is very long and because it has not yet been submitted, I am not at liberty to record it all here.</p>
<p>These three motions may not be proposed, - we are going to be disappointed. We arrived at the station early this morning (27th) (before 8:00 AM) and sat there for more than ten minutes. Knowing that the express train was not running, we wanted to switch to the night train, but as of this moment (3:00 PM on the 27th), the tickets have not been purchased, and I am afraid we cannot leave, - I am afraid we will not make it to the congress. The congress has a fixed date, of course, it cannot wait for us. If we really cannot make it, then we cannot propose motions, we cannot discuss. Our hopes have vanished - we are disappointed!</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Punishes those who Deceitfully Receive Special Rice Rations</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities have issued key rice rations to teachers and staff of public and private schools in this city in order to stabilize the lives of these workers and increase work efficiency. At the same time, in order to prevent double-dipping, it is stipulated that part-time teachers and staff are only allowed to receive rations at one school. If it is found that they have deceitfully received rations from two schools, the schools concerned will be subject to the penalty of having all rice rations suspended. Recently, the Material Distribution Office found that several teachers had concurrently received rice rations, and they have already suspended their special rations for one month to show a warning. Furthermore, Fan Zhixuan, a teacher at Shumin Middle School, fabricated a false name and falsely reported his age and citizen's certificate number in order to concurrently receive rice rations. After investigation by the Education Bureau, he was instructed to be transferred to the police station for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Football Match Held to Celebrate the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>March 30 marks the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. To celebrate, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has requested the Shanghai Football Association to hold an exhibition match, scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 30th at the racecourse on Jingan Temple Road. At that time, the Hualian team will compete against the Xilian team.

The Allied Naval Band will perform famous songs. In order to maintain order at the stadium, admission tickets will be sold at the entrance of the stadium by the Football Association for a fee. Official agencies, organizations, and schools wishing to attend the football match may submit a formal letter stating the number of attendees, signed and stamped by the person in charge, to the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association at 160 Da Shanghai Road before 5:00 PM today (the 28th) so that the Football Association can be requested to provide free admission at its discretion.</p>

<h3>Enrollment in Free Elementary Schools; Request Assistance from Neighboring Schools; Hope Baojia Chiefs Will Also Actively Introduce</h3>
<p>The preparations for the ten free elementary schools organized by this office have been repeatedly reported in this column. In addition to training twenty teachers at the Xinzha Road Elementary School in recent days, enrollment matters are being actively handled. Although we have been vigorously promoting it in the newspapers recently, perhaps few out-of-school children and their parents have the opportunity to read the newspapers. Therefore, the following two methods are used: (1) Please ask the teachers of the neighboring elementary and middle schools around each free school to verbally promote and introduce enrollment to out-of-school children in the various alleys and lanes where they live for students above the upper grades; (2) Please ask the general Lian Bao chiefs near each free school to inform the Baojia chiefs to introduce out-of-school children to enroll. Saving out-of-school children is the most important social cause at present, and I think everyone will show sympathy and will be able to enthusiastically assist.</p>
<p>In order to collect teaching materials for the free schools, we have sent a letter to the China United Publishing Company, requesting donations of teaching methods. Yesterday, we received a reply agreeing to send down elementary school Chinese, arithmetic, common sense, and high school Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, and natural teaching methods, totaling forty-four types, ten copies of each type, totaling four hundred and forty copies. Their enthusiasm for education is truly admirable. The letter is as follows:</p>
<p>**China United Publishing Company Generously Donates a Large Number of Books**</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter stating that your association is holding free elementary schools to help out-of-school children and benefit society, which is deeply admired. We will comply with your request to donate elementary school teaching methods to express our sincerity. Now, the full number is matched according to the list, with a total of forty-four types, ten of each type, attached to this letter. I hope you will receive it.</p>
<p>In addition, the entire student body of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Third Elementary School donated 723 textbooks, Yu Elementary School 600 textbooks, and Yongguang Elementary School 500 textbooks, whose enthusiasm is equally admirable.</p>
<p>**Ningbo Shanghai Third Elementary School Students Donate Money and Gifts**</p>
<p>A letter from all the students of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Third Elementary School said: "Your newspaper is founding free elementary schools, launching a campaign to collect textbooks, and soliciting free school funds, which we fully sympathize with. We found the textbooks we had read and saved up our daily snack money. As of yesterday, we have donated 723 textbooks and 20,000 yuan in savings, which we will send first, and we ask our classmates to continue to raise donations, and we hope that other students will respond together."</p>
<h3>Report on Donations for Free School Funds (9)</h3>
<p>The entire student body of Ningbo Shanghai Third Elementary School donated 20,000 yuan, the fourth-grade students of Xiqu Elementary School saved candy money and transferred 2,500 yuan (Yan Suzhen 1,000 yuan, Qi Xiazhen 1,000 yuan, Shen Huaici 500 yuan), an anonymous person (receipt 75) 1,510 yuan, for a total of 24,010 yuan, plus the previous balance of 1,086,115 yuan.</p>
