<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午三時三十分發表：日航空部隊於昨（十九）日對敵機動部隊邀擊戰時收獲之戰果中，業經證明者如决二擊沉艦型不明者二艘，此外於戰塲中判明因日方攻擊而發生之爆炸及火柱各一處，擊落敵機百三十七架。（包含陸地及海上部隊之戰果）日方未歸還機若干架，陸地及海上損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電，日制空部隊自十八日晨以來，即對十八·十九兩日出現於九州東南海面攻擊九州·四國·中國·及阪·神方面之敵機動部隊，連續加以猛攻，迄十八日未明止，業判明戰果，使其艦種不詳二艘類似空母艦發生大火，且現已確認將之燒毀擊沉，此外並使二艘發生爆炸起火燃燒，而獲得莫大戰果。同時由於特別攻擊隊之突擊戰術，致令敵艦受創頗重。又敵機動部隊之艦載機，於十九日上午七時頃至下午五時之間，以一千一百十架分散向九州。四國。中國。及阪神方面來襲，嗣經日軍航空部隊地上部隊及水上部隊共同邀擊後，除擊墜其百三十七架外，並將其大部擊毀而予以重創。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　十八·十九兩日出現於九州東南海面，而攻擊九洲·四國·中國·及阪·神方面之敵機動部隊，其後似巳退向四國南方海面，迄二十日止，敵機動部隊之艦載機並無來襲之情勢。</p>

<h3 id="c5">申論同鄉會辦理疏散工作要點 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>疏散委員會前昨兩日分別召集各慈善機關及各同鄕會代表，討論實施疏散問題。昨日已就慈善機關實施疏散辦法，加以申論，茲復對同鄕會辦理疏散事項再加　釋如次：</p>
<p>（一）慈善機關本身是疏散者，同鄉會木身不是疏散者，而是協助同鄉疏散。所以，兩者的疏散辦法是不盡相同的。也可說前者比較單純，後者更爲　繁複。疏散委員會所以召集同鄉會共同商討者，因爲　同鄕會原是同鄉集團，對於同鄕原有服役的義務。而且同鄉會辦理同鄉疏散工作，不僅爲　同鄕服務，更爲　協助政府推行政策。現在疏散委員會已經規定，四月一日起開始一般市民疏散登記，按照警察分局所轄區域，分十八個區辦理。各同鄉會應即轉吿同鄕一切登記手續，照章辦理。</p>
<p>（二）疏散回鄕者，必須繳回居住證，換取移動證，並由主管機關加蓋「還鄕」戳記，已經明白規定，同鄕會更應轉吿疏散同鄕必須遵照辦理，以免臨時因手續不合而遭遇困難。</p>
<p>（三）同鄉會主要工作，除上述二點外，對於貧苦同鄕之疏散回鄕，予以經濟上之協助。並接受疏散委員會之委託，辦理特的事務。至於疏散之車船運輸，均由疏散委員會直接供應，如同鄕會能代同鄕設法專船專車者，應以減收費用爲　原則，並取得疏散委員會之許可與協助。</p>
<p>（四）疏散交通工具，均由疏散委員會航陸路兩專門委員會統籌辦理，疏散專船或專車，對於檢查手續請求減免，並由軍警沿途保護，如同鄕會單獨利用商輪或商車，搭載疏散旅客，則在車站碼頭之麻煩，沿途之檢查，疏散委員會無法協助，無從避免。</p>
<p>（五）同鄕會希望疏散委員會對於疏散同鄕在經濟上予以協助一點，疏散委員會本身經費有限，對於慈善團體補助經費，巳感不敷，因此，疏散人員個別補助絕不可能。本來疏散委員會之任務，僅在計畫疏散步驟，供應交通工具，協助減少行旅麻煩，保護安全等等。對於貧苦同鄉之濟助原是同鄉會的責任，應由各同鄕斟酌本身能力施以濟助。</p>
<p>至於歸鄕路程遼遠如湖南湖北江西等同鄉，疏散目的地並不限於原籍。其决，一般勞工及壯丁，將來上海的軍需工業仍有存在，即或疏散，也須隨同工業疏散，照常工作。</p>
<h3 id="c6">南中國海沿岸敵機不斷侵擾　企圖實現接近大陸野心 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>大陸某基地二十日中央社電　敵軍最近之動向，以南中國爲重點，其攻勢可分爲自中國內地及目菲島基地兩方面。自二月中旬起，敵軍攻勢漸决激化，至三月六日更形活躍，敵機B24型B25型P51型等連日自淸晨九時至四時來襲，最爲頻繁，甚且利用夜間或冒惡劣天氣，以波狀襲擊航行中之船舶，轟炸機低空俯迴，機槍掃射。來自中國內地之敵機，以香港以南自海南島至東京灣等地之敵機，則擔任厦門汕頭香港等區域，其行動以單機或少數機自基地爲起點，陣形爲三角形或四角形不等採取行動。現在菲島方面之敵戰鬥機的八百架，轟炸機五百架，共計一千三百架，尤其明多羅島方面敵機少行動，最近由擾亂海上輸送而轉移爲戰略轟炸之傾向。又中國大陸敵機之動靜，最近以昆明爲中心，有相當增强，除襲擊華南沿岸一帶外，亦來襲華北華中一帶，邇來更開始本格的戰略轟炸，戰意相當濃厚。又敵軍現似努力於建築沿岸基地，如福建省崇安地區（福州西北二百四十公里）正趕築廣長滑走路之飛機塲，敵軍刻正全力企圖實現接近大陸之野心。</p>
<h3 id="c7">襲名古屋敵機八十架重創 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電十九日拂曉來襲名古屋之敵B29型機，經日方邀擊後，共擊落其四架，重創其八十架左右。</p>
<p>敵機暴行機槍掃射　東京廿日中央社電　十八日下午零時四十分左右，敵機分數編隊向愛媛縣西南方之村落，投擲少數炸彈及燒夷彈，並對海上之帆船及村落之行人，低飛至距地二三百公尺以機槍掃射，然行人均殆無損害。又是日夕刻，進入于宇和島港之機器帆船二艘，突受敵機六架兩次機槍掃射，船身受數十發彈痕，然仍繼續航行。又是日正午在日豐綫椎田松江間行駛中之下行火車，亦遭敵機掃射，當時機車司機之頭部中數彈，然在上角助手異常機警，急行停車，火車得免於顚覆。</p>
<h3 id="c8">襲北千島敵機使用火箭炸彈 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>扎幌二十日中央社電來襲北千島之敵機，最近已開始使用火箭炸彈，其目的及效用等殊値注目。一月二十五日敵機B24型來襲北千島時，即開始使用此種炸彈，厥後來製之敵機B24型，殆均備有此種裝置。使用時，大致於對目標五百公尺乃至一千公尺之附近高度，由一百公尺降至五十公尺發射炸彈，此時並多使用機槍掃射。火箭炸彈發射時，發電氣之響音，由後尾噴出茶色之烟。該彈直徑七·五粍，長五十吋，噴進筒直徑爲十二吋，長一一三公尺，噴進筒亦可與火箭炸彈同時飛翔同時炸裂，全部重的五十公斤。該彈聞在有效距離圈內，並無死角，此爲其威力所在，破片飛散半徑的爲　五十公尺，作水平狀，彈痕殆不能辨認，至地面炸裂，故避免此種危險之法，以人防空壕爲最佳。</p>

<p>中央社訊　渝方國民黨最近在各地强制徵收糧食。據延安新華日報傳，峨眉縣政府遣派多數科長科員分赴鄉鎮徵收糧食，農民中因貧困或受災而未能繳出糧食者，解送縣府拘禁，其數每日有十人或二十人之多，普興鎭劉某及南王廟王某因無法繳糧，實行自殺，富豪階級收買囤積糧食，以致物價狂漲，人民痛苦極爲深刻</p>

<p>此外由於交通機關和工塲等，都被破壞和徽發了，所以失業者像洪水般浸透了意大利。羅馬市的十分之一人口，即二十萬人沒有飯吃，縱有的人有職業，每日僅得三十里拉，但每餐二百里拉至三百里拉，自然也不能維持生活。食糧不足，物價騰貴，失業等現象，充滿了意大利，接踵而來的自然便是犯罪，尤其是女性犯罪。法國的惡性通貨膨脹，與意大利相互媲美。除軍票外，尙有法國銀行券六千億法郞以上在市面上流通着。和美元及英磅的兌換率，日見低下。但食糧問題極端嚴重，所以工資一星期提高百分之五十，這並不算什麽希奇的現象。在法國也和意大利一樣，人民不能利用交通工具，要想購買火車票及輪船票，實在困難萬分·法國北部的煤鑛尙未接收，所以今日的巴黎尙得不到一塊煤炭。號稱世界第一的森林，也被巴黎市民砍伐殆盡。黑市肉往往在烟紙店中出售，藥舖中買賣靑菜，也已經司空見慣。缺乏物資的美國兵士，也往往偸出軍需物資來高價出售，被發覺後受軍法處分者，巳經是街頭巷尾的談話資料了。影戲院及劇院等全部停止營業了，尙在營業中者，只是咖啡館及舞廳，這全都是英美將士的御用機關。英美方面宣傳機關，大吹大擂地說：法國目前的惡性通貨膨脹和食糧不足，全是因爲德國破壞法國平時機構所造成，但前任美國生產業者聯合會長菲得力·科羅福，一月五日在本國曾發表視察結果：</p>
<p>法蘭西及比利時等國人民，曾在德國統治下過着悲慘生活，這不免言過其實，實際上，法國在納粹的統治下，反享受着「消費量氣」。</p>
<p>他的話，竟把本國製的欺騙宣傳揭穿了。</p>
<p>希臘和第一次世界大戰後的德國前後媲美於人類歷史者，總得算希臘的惡性通貨膨脹了。該國固然在德國統治時老早就進入通貨膨脹的過程，但自從去年九月英美軍登陸以來，通貨膨脹的程度愈發直綫地上昇了。德國軍隊佔領的當時，貨幣流通量不過二百十億德拉格瑪，但未經半載，去年底竟達三百億德拉格瑪的天文學數字，通貨信用，因而一落千丈。</p>
<p>我們舉一實例來看，去秋三支香烟，値五百萬德拉格瑪，目前新政府在英國援助之下，發行金準備的新德拉格瑪幣。</p>
<p>一英鎊等於六百新幣；一新幣等於五百億舊幣，按這樣兌換率來整頓通貨。但因政治不安定，於是也就影響到通貨的不安定，而國計民生也只有付諸東流。</p>
<p>餓民示威</p>
<p>比利時爲　收回和調整德國佔領時所發行的一千八百五十億法郞通貨，於去年十月，英比曾締結新通貨協定，根據這一協定，曾發表過通貨整理措施</p>
<p>例如一萬法郞，一千法郞，五百法郞，一百法郞的比利時銀行券，十月十三日後，取消其流通力，須與新幣兌換，但領取新幣的限度，每人二千法郞，如超過此限度的現款，四成暫時不發，六成則永久凍結，同時還須交付高率的戰時不當利得稅。所謂凍結，就是事實上的沒收，但沒收之外還要課稅，所以人民都非常憤慨。</p>
<p>此外，比利時人民受英國經濟的壓迫，犧牲過於嚴重的緣故，所以全國陷於大混亂中，布魯塞簡直停止了一切商業行爲　，老幣的價値跌落得令人難以置信。又加上食糧及燃料不足，無法忍受的市民們，便羣集於十字街頭，向官廳舉行一餓民示威」遊行。政府雖然動員所有的載重汽車和火車，但無貨可運，又加上收買及配給機構常常舞幣貪汚，於是如火上加油，愈發造成物資畸形缺乏的現象。去年底首相皮魯親身飛往倫敦，請求援助，但英美富局藉口軍事運輸，而不能運輸食糧。</p>
<p>通貨貶值</p>
<p>法通貨整頓，這是法國內政上最大的一個難題，特戈爾政權頒佈命令，禁止金條買賣，交出金條及外幣，禁止德國馬克在法國境內出口及入口等，周時公佈新的法律說，凡是維希政府時代，藉與德國交易與不正商業行爲　而賺得的財產，全部加以沒收。這因爲始無力政權的法令，所以法令自法令，反而只有發起更大的混亂。法郞紙幣一落千大，路易金幣（舊二十法郞金幣），竟由三千八百法郞跳至四千三百五十法郞。美元與英磅的黑市買賣，到處橫行</p>
<p>英美當局對於佔領地區所實行的不負責任通貨政策，到處都助長了惡性通貨膨脹，這是一種計謀，乘通貨膨脹而使弱小國家依靠金元與金磅，結局只有對英美屈膝方能取得生存。投降英美的歐洲各國，所處的環境就是如是悲慘，各該國的人民，只有隊奴隸般地爲英美勞動。這是對同文同種的暴虐行爲。美國對於始終不承認是人類的我們亞洲人，將如何虐待，這是不言而喩的事。（完）（林譯目二月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，昨日下午循例舉行報這會議，松平情報部長闡述美國對渝，利用手段施以經濟上之壓力，企圖仍在戰後掌握中國經濟力軍。談話大要如次：</p>
<p>據二三日前美國方而消息，前美國物價管理局長亨特生，因重慶方面物價暴漲，爲謀安定物價對策起見，已抵渝從事調査，同時中國戰時生產局最高顧問納爾生回美後，已與當局接洽一切，決定遣派技士到渝工作，一部份人員業已到達重慶，開始工作。又據最近消息，美國經濟專家在渝經過數個月之調査，其報吿書已完成，並擬就開發工業之五年計劃，共需二十萬美金，渝方對此計劃是否接受，尙　疑問。我人　　渝方即欲開發工業，而根據此項計劃進行，則所有一切以前擬定之計劃，勢必完全改變，而在事實上將來所有資源人力，亦將仰給於美國。就美國方面言，此爲其蓄意巳久之計劃，美國對東亞之政策有二：一爲擊碎日本之戰力，二爲掌握中國重要產業，使之處於美國經濟壓制之下。美國現在儘一切可能，以求早日撃碎日本。不顧一切的向日進攻。今對中國之工業開發計劃，需時須五年之久，當然其目的非爲　完成此次戰爭，乃欲於戰後爲永久握持中國之經濟力量張本而已。因之渝方對於美國此種計劃，自應有其慎重考慮之必要也。</p>

<p>本報舉辦義務小學，經費方面，前經商定義賣市塲委員會同意，指撥一百萬元，作爲開辦費，昨已如數取到，義賣市塲，熱忱贊助，使義務小學工作，</p>
<p>因而發軔推動，自是可感。昨日復接讀者紛紛來函贊助，率皆激於同情心及責任感，詞意懇切，溢於言表。我們固覺工作艱巨，然賴社會之熱烈響應，深信必能達成任務。茲將來函節錄如决：</p>
<p>（一）私立器成小學校全體學生來函云：「今天我們全體同學們，看到貴報上關於創辦義務學校的記載，大家都覺得這是一件非常有價値有意義的福利事業。因爲。使一大羣在生活脅迫下失學可憐的孩子們，有了求學的機會，又可以帮助一羣請寒敎師的生活，這不是「一舉兩得』嗎？所以在開罷朝會後，我們都很慷慨的將衣袋裏所有零用錢凑合起來，計中儲券一萬元，捐給貴報，作爲「義學金」。</p>
<p>我們都是正在分利時的小學生，但是激於人類的同情心和責任感，不自量力的，貢獻這區區小數。不過，我們認爲全上海的小學生數量，是相當可觀的，希望大家本着「已肌巴溺」的先賢古訓共起響應，那末，幾百萬的鉅數，是不難成就的。我們這微數，不過是「拋磚引玉」罷丁！</p>
<p>（二）改業的小學敎師王振風君來兩云：「振風服務敎育界，垂十餘年，平素對於敎育，頗感興趣。惟近以所入菲薄，不能維持入口之家，被迫棄儒就商，每在業餘，猶以敎育爲念。頃見貴報創辦義務小學，發起微募「義學金』，旣可救濟失學，又可維持失學敎師，一舉兩得，用意至善。爰將一日所得儲券五千元，奉作「義學金」。並希社會人士，迅起響應，使義小得以普遍設立，則造福國族，豈有限量哉？」</p>
<p>（三）木匠丁生林君來函云：「昨晚據小兒杏根說，貴報創辦義務小學十所，本人聽了覺得非常高興。我在四十年前，也是一個失學兒童，因爲家境清寒，只好學木匠，至今只恨自己少讀幾年書，每逢投標往來書信等情，非請拆字攤王先生不可。四十年來的苦痛，時刻不能忘掉。但豈能眼看計多小孩子們，同我一樣的失學呢？我是老了，孩子們有他的前程，我個人雖然拿出一千元錢，希望社會上有力人士，多多出錢，救救失學兒童。」</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 20th that among the gains achieved by the Japanese air force during the engagement against the enemy mobile force yesterday (the 19th), it has been confirmed that two unidentified ships have been sunk. Furthermore, one explosion and one pillar of fire were observed in the battlefield, resulting from Japanese attacks. One hundred thirty-seven enemy aircraft were shot down (including results from land and sea-based units). Several Japanese aircraft have not returned, but land and sea damage is minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: Since the morning of the 18th, the Japanese air superiority forces have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile force appearing in the southeast sea of Kyushu on the 18th and 19th, which attacked Kyushu, Shikoku, China, and the Osaka-Kobe area. By the break of dawn on the 18th, it was determined that the battle results showed two unidentified ships resembling aircraft carriers catching fire, and it has now been confirmed that they were burned and sunk. In addition, two other ships exploded and caught fire, resulting in tremendous gains. At the same time, the special attack units' surprise attack tactics caused considerable damage to enemy ships. Furthermore, between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM on the 19th, the enemy mobile force's carrier-based aircraft, totaling 1,110, launched scattered attacks on Kyushu, Shikoku, China, and the Osaka-Kobe area. After a joint counterattack by Japanese air force ground units and naval units, in addition to shooting down 137 aircraft, the majority were destroyed and severely damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy mobile force that appeared in the southeast sea of Kyushu on the 18th and 19th, attacking Kyushu, Shikoku, China, and the Osaka-Kobe area, appears to have retreated towards the sea south of Shikoku. As of the 20th, there has been no sign of any attack from the enemy mobile force's carrier-based aircraft.</p>

<p>Burmese Front, 19th – Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese army in the Meiktila area, in order to completely annihilate the strong enemy forces that invaded Meiktila to seize central Burma and retake Pegu, launched a simultaneous offensive on the 14th. Against the enemy forces that repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's positions with flamethrower tanks and medium tanks under air force cover, the Japanese launched a fierce counterattack and continued to carry out night attacks under strong artillery cover. They finally recaptured the Meiktila city streets, which had once fallen into enemy hands from the 14th to the 15th, and re-secured the vital point between Mandalay and Yangon. At the same time, a separate detachment surrounded and captured five airfields around the city, thus crushing the enemy's plan to build an air base in Meiktila, and their rear supply line was cut off. The enemy had previously used transport planes to supply the enemy forces around the city, but now they are in a state of panic due to the loss of landing points. However, because the enemy has consistently attempted to seize the East Airfield, several hundred enemy soldiers, with fifty tanks, attacked again on the 16th. The Japanese army firmly defended the north of the airfield and resisted, and since the 17th, a fierce attack has been launched on a part of the enemy forces at the East Airfield. At the same time, the Japanese army near the Irrawaddy River crossing point, in order to respond to this, began to advance on the enemy's rear.</p>

<p>Philippine Front, 19th – Central News Agency dispatch: The Zamboanga Japanese garrison's army and navy units are exceptionally vigorous and brave, firmly defending their positions and inflicting heavy blows on the invading enemy forces. On the 17th, the enemy, under the cover of two tanks and multiple mortars, launched several attacks on the Japanese army's left-wing positions.

<h3 id="e5">Key Points for Township Associations to Handle Evacuation Work <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The Evacuation Committee convened representatives from various charitable organizations and township associations in the past two days to discuss the implementation of evacuation. Yesterday, the methods for charitable organizations to implement evacuation were discussed in detail. Now, further explanation is added regarding the evacuation matters handled by township associations as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Charitable organizations themselves are evacuees, while township associations themselves are not evacuees, but rather assist fellow villagers in evacuating. Therefore, the evacuation methods for the two are not entirely the same. It can also be said that the former is relatively simple, while the latter is more complex. The reason why the Evacuation Committee convened township associations for joint discussion is because township associations are originally groups of fellow villagers and have an original obligation to serve them. Moreover, township associations handling evacuation work for fellow villagers not only serve their fellow villagers but also assist the government in implementing policies. The Evacuation Committee has now stipulated that general public evacuation registration will begin on April 1st, handled in 18 districts according to the areas under the jurisdiction of the police stations. All township associations should immediately inform fellow villagers of all registration procedures and handle them in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>(2) Those evacuating back to their hometown must return their residence permits in exchange for movement permits and have the words "Returning Home" stamped by the competent authority. This has been clearly stipulated, and township associations should further inform evacuating fellow villagers that they must comply to avoid encountering difficulties due to non-compliance with procedures.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to the above two points, the main work of township associations is to provide economic assistance to poor fellow villagers who are evacuating back to their hometowns and to accept the Evacuation Committee's entrustment to handle special matters. As for evacuation transportation by vehicle or boat, the Evacuation Committee directly provides it. If township associations can arrange special boats or special vehicles for fellow villagers, they should reduce fees as a principle and obtain the permission and assistance of the Evacuation Committee.</p>
<p>(4) Evacuation transportation is uniformly handled by the Evacuation Committee's specialized committees for land and sea routes. Requests for exemptions from inspection procedures for evacuation special boats or special vehicles are made, and military police provide protection along the way. If township associations independently use commercial ships or commercial vehicles to transport evacuating passengers, the Evacuation Committee cannot assist or avoid the troubles at stations and docks and inspections along the way.</p>
<p>(5) The Evacuation Committee hopes that the Evacuation Committee will provide economic assistance to evacuating fellow villagers. The Evacuation Committee itself has limited funding, and the subsidies for charitable organizations are already insufficient. Therefore, individual subsidies for evacuees are absolutely impossible. Originally, the task of the Evacuation Committee is only to plan evacuation steps, provide transportation, assist in reducing travel troubles, protect safety, and so on. Assisting poor fellow villagers is originally the responsibility of the township associations, and they should provide assistance based on their own capabilities.</p>
<p>As for fellow villagers whose journey back home is far, such as those from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, the evacuation destination is not limited to their place of origin. It is determined that general laborers and strong young men will still have a role in Shanghai's military-industrial sector in the future. Even if they evacuate, they must evacuate along with the industry and continue to work as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Enemy Aircraft Continuously Invade the South China Sea Coast, Attempting to Realize Their Ambition to Approach the Mainland <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A certain base in the mainland, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy's recent movements focus on the South China Sea, and their offensive can be divided into two aspects: from the Chinese mainland and from the Philippine island base. Since mid-February, the enemy's offensive has gradually intensified, and it became even more active on March 6th. Enemy aircraft, such as B-24, B-25, and P-51 types, have been attacking daily from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, most frequently, and even taking advantage of nighttime or bad weather to attack ships sailing in waves, with bombers diving at low altitude and machine-gunning. Enemy aircraft coming from the Chinese mainland, from Hong Kong south to Hainan Island to Tokyo Bay, are responsible for areas such as Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong. Their actions originate from bases as single aircraft or in small numbers, forming triangles or quadrangles of varying sizes. Currently, there are 800 enemy fighters and 500 bombers, totaling 1,300 aircraft, in the Philippines, especially in the Mindoro area. The enemy aircraft have recently shifted from disrupting maritime transport to strategic bombing. Also, the movements of enemy aircraft on the Chinese mainland have recently been significantly strengthened, centered on Kunming. In addition to attacking the coastal areas of South China, they also attack areas in North and Central China, and have recently begun full-scale strategic bombing, indicating a considerable intensity of war effort. Moreover, the enemy seems to be working hard to build coastal bases, such as in the Chong'an area of Fujian Province (240 kilometers northwest of Fuzhou), where they are rushing to build a large and long runway airfield. The enemy is currently making every effort to realize its ambition to approach the mainland.</p>

<p>Enemy Aircraft's Atrocities: Machine Gun Strafing</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: Around 12:40 PM on the 18th, several formations of enemy aircraft dropped a small number of bombs and incendiary bombs on villages in the southwest of Ehime Prefecture and machine-gunned sailboats at sea and pedestrians in the villages, flying as low as 200 to 300 meters above the ground. However, the pedestrians suffered almost no harm. Also, on the same day, two machine-powered sailboats entering the port of Uwajima were suddenly subjected to two machine-gun strafing runs by six enemy aircraft. The ship's hulls suffered dozens of bullet holes, but they continued to sail. Also, at noon on the same day, a train traveling on the down line between Shiida and Matsue on the Nippo Line was also machine-gunned by enemy aircraft. At that time, the locomotive driver's head was struck by several bullets, but the assistant on the upper corner was exceptionally alert and quickly stopped the train, preventing it from overturning.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Enemy Aircraft Attacking the Northern Kuril Islands Use Rocket Bombs <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Sapporo, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: Enemy aircraft attacking the Northern Kuril Islands have recently begun using rocket bombs, and their purpose and effectiveness are particularly noteworthy. When enemy B-24 aircraft attacked the Northern Kuril Islands on January 25th, they began using this type of bomb. Since then, almost all enemy B-24 aircraft made later have been equipped with this device. When used, the bombs are launched at a height of approximately 500 to 1,000 meters above the target, dropping to 50 to 100 meters. Machine guns are also often used at this time. When the rocket bomb is launched, there is an electrical sound, and brownish smoke comes out of the tail. The diameter of the missile is 7.5 mm, the length is 50 inches, the diameter of the injection cylinder is 12 inches, the length is 113 cm, and the injection cylinder can also fly and explode at the same time as the rocket bomb. The total weight is 50 kg. It is heard that there is no dead angle within the effective range of the bomb, which is its power. The radius of fragment scattering is 50 meters, in a horizontal shape. The bomb's markings are almost unrecognizable until it explodes on the ground, so the best way to avoid this danger is with a human-made air-raid shelter.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch: In the past 24 hours, the battle situation in the southern part of the Western Front has greatly expanded. Large-scale armored warfare has unfolded in the area between the Moselle, Saar, and Rhine rivers. The American army's intention is clearly to cut off the German army west of the Rhine River with pincer tactics. Furthermore, the American Third Army is now advancing further south and southwest, with the vanguard of its armored units crossing the Nahe River and continuing south, intensifying pressure west of Saarbrucken and advancing towards Bingenfield. The American Seventh Army, which is attacking the southern wing of the Saar front, has now shifted its attack focus to the northwest of Hellbach Biese and the southeast of Saarbrucken.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th – Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency: The American bridgehead on the east bank of the Rhine River opposite Remagen is fighting for the 10-kilometer-long highway to Cologne and Frankfurt, but the outcome has not yet been decided. On Sunday, the German army counterattacked repeatedly, pushing the American army westward. Some enemy forces crossed the highway and entered the two cities of Lutzschidt and Sanninburg. The two sides are in close combat for the Olberg ridge and the northern line of Spenberch, and the city of Honingen is still under contention.</p>

Currently, the Soviet army is attacking relentlessly in the areas of Radipol and Kozel, with little progress. At the same time, the offensive launched from Grottgau towards Neisse has also come into contact with the main force north of Neustadt.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing Kuomintang has recently been forcibly collecting grain in various places. According to the Yan'an Xinhua Daily, the Emei County government dispatched a large number of section chiefs and staff members to various towns to collect grain. Farmers who were unable to pay the grain due to poverty or disaster were sent to the county government for detention. Their number is as many as ten or twenty people per day. Liu of Puxing Town and Wang of Nanwang Temple committed suicide because they were unable to pay the grain. Wealthy classes buy and hoard grain, causing prices to soar, and the people suffer extremely deeply.</p>

<p>Furthermore, due to the destruction and confiscation of transportation facilities and factories, the unemployed have flooded Italy like a deluge. One-tenth of Rome's population, or 200,000 people, have no food to eat. Even those who have jobs earn only 30 lire a day, but each meal costs 200 to 300 lire, making it impossible to maintain a living. Food shortages, soaring prices, and unemployment are rampant in Italy, naturally leading to crime, especially among women. The vicious inflation in France rivals that of Italy. In addition to military scrip, more than 600 billion francs in French banknotes are circulating in the market. The exchange rate with the US dollar and British pound is declining daily. However, the food problem is extremely serious, so a 50% increase in wages per week is not considered a rare phenomenon. In France, as in Italy, people cannot use transportation easily, and buying train and ship tickets is extremely difficult. The coal mines in northern France have not yet been taken over, so Paris still cannot get a single piece of coal today. The forest, reputed to be the world's largest, has been almost completely felled by the citizens of Paris. Black market meat is often sold in cigarette shops, and buying and selling vegetables in pharmacies has become commonplace. American soldiers, lacking supplies, often steal military supplies and sell them at high prices. Those who are discovered and subjected to military law have become the talk of the town. Movie theaters and theaters have all ceased operations. Only cafes and dance halls are still open, all of which are exclusively for British and American soldiers. The British and American propaganda machines loudly proclaim that the current vicious inflation and food shortages in France are all caused by Germany's destruction of French institutions. However, Frederick Crowell, the former president of the US Manufacturing Association, published his inspection results in his home country on January 5:</p>
<p>It is an exaggeration to say that the people of France and Belgium lived a miserable life under German rule. In fact, France enjoyed "consumption comfort" under Nazi rule.</p>
<p>His words exposed the deceptive propaganda manufactured by his own country.</p>
<p>Greece and Germany after World War I are comparable in human history. Greece's vicious inflation is one such example. The country had long entered the process of inflation during German rule, but since the British and American troops landed last September, the degree of inflation has risen sharply. At the time of the German army's occupation, the amount of currency in circulation was only 21 billion drachmas, but in less than half a year, by the end of last year, it had reached the astronomical figure of 300 billion drachmas, and the currency's credit plummeted.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a real example. Last fall, three cigarettes were worth 5 million drachmas. The current new government, with British aid, is issuing new drachma coins with gold reserves.</p>
<p>One British pound is equal to 600 new coins; one new coin is equal to 50 billion old coins. The currency is being reorganized according to this exchange rate. However, due to political instability, currency instability is also affected, and the national economy and people's livelihood can only be lost.</p>
<p>Hungry People's Demonstration</p>
<p>In order to recover and adjust the 185 billion francs of currency issued by Germany during its occupation, Belgium signed a new currency agreement with Britain in October last year. According to this agreement, currency consolidation measures were announced.</p>
<p>For example, Belgian banknotes of 10,000 francs, 1,000 francs, 500 francs, and 100 francs were canceled after October 13 and must be exchanged for new currency. However, the limit for receiving new currency is 2,000 francs per person. For cash exceeding this limit, 40% will not be issued temporarily, and 60% will be permanently frozen. At the same time, a high rate of wartime unjust enrichment tax must also be paid. So-called freezing is de facto confiscation, but in addition to confiscation, taxes must also be levied, so people are very angry.</p>
<p>In addition, the Belgian people have been oppressed by the British economy, and the sacrifice has been too severe, so the whole country is in great chaos. Brussels has almost stopped all commercial activities, and the value of the old currency has fallen unbelievably. In addition to the lack of food and fuel, the unbearable citizens gathered at the crossroads and held a "hungry people's demonstration" march to the government offices. Although the government mobilized all the trucks and trains, there was no goods to transport. In addition, the purchasing and distribution agencies often engage in corruption, which added fuel to the fire and created a more distorted shortage of materials. At the end of last year, Prime Minister Pierlot personally flew to London to request assistance, but the British and American rich authorities used military transportation as an excuse and could not transport food.</p>
<p>Currency Devaluation</p>
<p>The consolidation of the French currency is the biggest difficulty in French domestic policy. The de Gaulle regime issued an order prohibiting the sale of gold bars, the surrender of gold bars and foreign currency, and the prohibition of the export and import of German marks in France. At the same time, a new law was announced, saying that all property earned during the Vichy government era through transactions with Germany and illegal commercial activities will be confiscated. This is because the decrees of the powerless regime are just decrees, which only caused greater chaos. The French franc plummeted, and the Louis gold coin (old 20-franc gold coin) jumped from 3,800 francs to 4,350 francs. Black market trading in US dollars and British pounds is rampant everywhere.</p>
<p>The irresponsible currency policies implemented by the British and American authorities in the occupied areas have everywhere fueled vicious inflation. This is a trick to make weak countries rely on gold dollars and gold pounds through inflation, and the result is that they can only survive by yielding to Britain and America. The European countries that surrendered to Britain and America are in such a tragic situation that the people of each country can only work for Britain and America like slaves. This is a tyrannical act against people of the same culture. It goes without saying how the United States will abuse us Asians who they have never recognized as human beings.

<h3 id="e21">Various Native Place Associations Should Assist Compatriots Unable to Return Home; Director Zhou Reports on Key Points for Handling Evacuation <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's Population Evacuation Committee, in order to actively plan the evacuation work of the general public, reconvened a discussion meeting yesterday (20th) afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room, hosted by the committee's Liaison Group in conjunction with the Social Welfare Bureau. Representatives from various Shanghai native place associations were invited to attend. Gu Jiwu, Chen Binhe, and Zhou Yuying, directors of the committee's various groups, as well as Director Zhou Yuying of the Social Welfare Bureau, attended on time. More than 60 native place association representatives were present. Director Zhou first reported on the key points for native place associations in handling evacuation:</p>
<p>(1) General public evacuation registration will begin on April 1, and will be handled in 18 districts according to the areas under the jurisdiction of the police stations.</p>
<p>(2) Those who evacuate back to their hometowns must return their residence permits in exchange for movement permits, and the competent authorities will stamp them with a "returning home" mark. The procedure is very simple.</p>
<p>(3) Those who return to their hometowns with Shanghai residence permits without going through evacuation procedures will be restricted by local governments in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Those who evacuate back to their hometowns will be prohibited from returning to Shanghai without necessary reasons. Those who must return to Shanghai must apply for permission from the competent authorities.</p>
<p>(5) The main tasks of the native place associations are: (a) To assist those with weak economic capacity who are unable to return home. (b) To answer inquiries from compatriots regarding evacuation procedures. (c) To convey notices from the Evacuation Committee. (d) Other matters entrusted by the Evacuation Committee. Native place associations may not handle evacuation without being entrusted by the Evacuation Committee, such as hiring their own vehicles and ships, or purchasing tickets on their behalf, in order to prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>(6) The acquisition of transportation and the purchase of tickets will be handled by the two specialized committees of the Evacuation Committee, namely the waterway and land routes.</p>
<p>Gu Jiwu explained the various points of evacuation and movement one by one. Then, the discussion of various actual problems began. Chen Binhe and Gu Jiwu respectively answered the various questions raised by the representatives of the native place associations. The meeting adjourned after more than an hour.</p>

The fees for using the shoreline have also been clearly stipulated. The details are as follows: (A) Wusong River shoreline usage fee: 100 yuan per meter per year in national currency. (B) Huangpu River shoreline usage fee: Section A, from the west bank of Wusongkou Fort Taiwan to Leping Road, the usage fee should be 800 yuan per meter per year. Section B, from the west bank of the 16th Wharf to Fengji Pier Road, 600 yuan. Section C, from the west bank of Fengji Pier Road to Longhua Port, 400 yuan.

<p>The Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent air raids and ensure the safety of citizens' lives, decided to dig air raid shelters in various districts of the city. Secretary-General Luo, on behalf of Mayor Zhou, broke ground. It is learned that the shelters have been dug and officially received by the headquarters. As for the air raid shelters in various districts of the city, 1,573 have been completed, 673 have not been completed, and the planned number is 842, for a total of 3,088. However, according to the person in charge of the headquarters to the reporter, the number of air raid shelters is still insufficient, so they will continue to be dug in the future, and it is hoped that citizens will cooperate to select appropriate addresses and submit them to the authorities for automatic digging.</p>

<p>Regarding the electricity supply issue for major factories, although it has not yet been fully resolved, it is learned that various factories in this city, due to electricity issues, have sent letters to their respective trade associations requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find ways to restore electricity supply from the authorities. The Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving such documents, has truthfully submitted them to the Ministry of Industry and the former Public Utilities Bureau, as well as the current Construction Bureau, requesting them to negotiate with the power company at their discretion. It is also heard that the authorities are fully dependent on coal sources for electricity generation, and are currently engaged in coal procurement. At the same time, they are striving to evacuate factories in this city to suitable areas, so there will be no problem with factory production work.</p>

<p>At No. 85, Lane 432, Xinchang Road in this city, a bloody case of a poisonous woman murdering her husband occurred yesterday morning. Zhan Yunying (30 years old, from Anhui, engaged in old goods), a resident on the rear floor of that number, was allegedly killed by his wife, Zhan Zhou (29 years old, from Zhejiang). For unknown reasons, she first cut his head with a kitchen knife, then cut his forehead and neck, and even cut his lower legs, thighs, upper legs, and waist more than a dozen times, dividing the body into eight pieces and putting them in a white empty leather suitcase, attempting to move the body to destroy the evidence. The second landlord, Wang Xieyang, discovered this and captured the murderer, Zhan Zhou, on the spot, and handed her over to the Xincheng Sub-bureau, which has jurisdiction over the area. The sub-bureau is conducting a careful investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Enemy America Attempts to Control China's Economy After the War; Minister Matsudaira Exposes the Enemy's American Ambitions <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Information Minister Matsudaira elaborated on the means by which the United States is exerting economic pressure on Chongqing, attempting to control China's economic forces after the war. The main points of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>According to news from the American side two or three days ago, former US Price Administration Director Henderson has arrived in Chongqing to conduct investigations in order to stabilize prices due to the soaring prices there. At the same time, Nelson, the chief adviser of China's Wartime Production Board, has contacted the authorities after returning to the United States and decided to send technicians to work in Chongqing. Some personnel have already arrived in Chongqing and started working. According to recent news, American economic experts have completed their report after several months of investigation in Chongqing, and have drafted a five-year plan for industrial development, requiring a total of 200,000 US dollars. It is still doubtful whether Chongqing will accept this plan. We believe that if Chongqing wants to develop its industry and proceeds according to this plan, all previously drafted plans will inevitably be completely changed, and in fact, all resources and manpower in the future will be dependent on the United States. From the American perspective, this is a long-planned plan. The United States has two policies towards East Asia: one is to crush Japan's war power, and the other is to control China's important industries and place them under American economic suppression. The United States is now doing everything possible to crush Japan as soon as possible, attacking Japan regardless of everything. The industrial development plan for China will take five years, so of course its purpose is not to complete this war, but to permanently hold China's economic power after the war. Therefore, Chongqing should carefully consider this plan of the United States.</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira to Broadcast Tonight: Information Minister Matsudaira will broadcast in Japanese to all parties at 7:20 PM today (21st) at the Shanghai Radio Station. It is reported that the content of his broadcast will be to expose the conflicting opinions of the British and American fleets in the Pacific Ocean and the increasing internal strife.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Supplementary Distribution of Coal Briquettes for Households in the Old District 18; 5 Catties per Certificate Sold for 200 Yuan; Simultaneous Distribution in Other Districts <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Materials Distribution Office previously distributed coal briquettes for households in the old District 18 and 8 from February 6th to 19th based on the 40th Comprehensive Distribution Certificate. However, due to the interruption of electricity supply to the designated coal briquette factories during the distribution period, even though the distribution period was once extended to February 25th, some citizens still did not receive the coal briquettes. Now that the coal briquette factories are shipping as usual, a supplementary sale will be held from March 17th to 26th based on the 40th Comprehensive Distribution Certificate. The amount per certificate is still 5 catties, and the price has been adjusted to 200 yuan per 5 catties in national currency due to the sharp increase in the factory's manufacturing costs, in order to maintain production. According to the reporter's investigation, the Materials Distribution Office will not extend the supplementary distribution period for coal briquettes for households in the old districts 18 and 8 after the expiration date. Therefore, citizens in those districts who have not yet received coal briquettes should go to the designated coal shops with their certificates to purchase them immediately. It is also learned that the distribution of coal briquettes for households in other districts will also begin on March 17th. All quantities, prices, and certificates used are the same as those in the old Districts 18 and 8.</p>
<p>Household Sugar to be Distributed Within the Month: The next period of household sugar distribution has been planned by the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association and is scheduled to be distributed within this month. The amount to be distributed this time is the same as the previous period, with each household being able to purchase 5 taels at a price of 265 yuan, which is slightly higher than the previous period by 5 yuan to compensate for the freight losses of the previous period.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Although the Motives Differ, the Enthusiasm is the Same; Everyone Responds to the "Free School Fund"; Funds from the Charity Market have been Received <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper is running a free elementary school. Regarding funding, the Charity Market Committee has previously agreed to allocate one million yuan as start-up expenses. The full amount has been received yesterday. The Charity Market's enthusiastic support has enabled the work of the free elementary school to begin and be promoted, which is commendable. Yesterday, we received letters from readers expressing their support, all driven by compassion and a sense of responsibility, with sincere words that overflowed with expression. We certainly feel that the work is arduous, but with the enthusiastic response from society, we are confident that we will be able to accomplish the task. Excerpts from the letters are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A letter from all the students of the Private Qicheng Elementary School says: "Today, all of our students saw the record in your newspaper about the establishment of a free school, and everyone felt that this is a very valuable and meaningful welfare undertaking. Because it gives a large group of helpless children who have dropped out of school due to the coercion of life the opportunity to study, and it can also help a group of poor teachers to make a living, isn't this a 'double win'? So, after the morning meeting, we all generously pooled all the pocket money in our pockets, totaling 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, and donated it to your newspaper as the 'Free School Fund'."</p>
<p>"We are all elementary school students who are currently sharing the benefits, but driven by human compassion and a sense of responsibility, we are contributing this small amount beyond our means. However, we believe that the number of elementary school students in Shanghai is quite considerable, and we hope that everyone will respond together in accordance with the ancient motto of the sages of 'Already Hungry, Already Drowning'. Then, it will not be difficult to achieve millions of dollars. Our small amount is just a 'brick to attract jade'!"</p>
<p>(2) Wang Zhenfeng, a primary school teacher who changed his profession, wrote: "Zhenfeng has served in the education field for more than ten years and has always been very interested in education. However, recently, due to the meager income, he cannot maintain his family and has been forced to abandon Confucianism and engage in commerce. Even in his spare time, he still thinks about education. Recently, he saw that your newspaper is running a free elementary school and initiating the fundraising of 'Free School Funds', which can both help those who have dropped out of school and maintain teachers who have lost their jobs, achieving two goals with one stone, which is a very good intention. Therefore, he has contributed 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, which he earned in one day, as the 'Free School Fund'. He also hopes that people from all walks of life will respond quickly so that free elementary schools can be established universally, which will benefit the country and the people without limit?"</p>
<p>(3) Carpenter Ding Shenglin wrote: "Last night, according to my son Xinggen, your newspaper is running ten free elementary schools. I was very happy to hear this. Forty years ago, I was also a child who dropped out of school because my family was poor. I had to learn carpentry. To this day, I only hate myself for not reading a few more years. Every time I need to bid for work or write letters, I have to ask Mr. Wang at the word-splitting stall. The pain of the past forty years cannot be forgotten at any time. But how can I watch so many children drop out of school like me? I am old, and the children have their future. Although I personally took out 1,000 yuan, I hope that people with influence in society will contribute more money to save the children who have dropped out of school."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Employee Loan Office originally targeted industrial and commercial employees as its loan targets. Starting from March, it has expanded its scope to include shop employees in addition to company employees. The loan limit has also been increased to 50,000 yuan, depending on the needs, in order to alleviate the difficulties faced by industrial and commercial employees in times of urgent need.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Reader's Assistance for Education News: Urging Schools to Collect Funds <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The current session's Assistance for Education Office has issued notifications to each school, along with blank receipts, to collect funds with their official seals. Most schools have already received their payments in full. However, a small number of schools have yet to collect, possibly due to postal errors. They are urged to send someone with their official seals to contact us. Furthermore, each school should collect and submit all approved student notification slips to the office for verification. If there are any students who have transferred or dropped out, the assistance funds should be returned. It is hoped that all schools' assistance funds can be fully settled within this month.</p>
<p>Broadcast Fundraising for Education Assistance: During the Lunar New Year, this newspaper and the News Daily worked with Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, borrowing the facilities of the Huangpu Radio Station to broadcast appeals for education assistance funds. Enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life responded actively, donating a total of 410,000 yuan in a short period. People have been assigned to collect all the donated money. This amount will be divided equally between the two newspapers, totaling 205,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>Overview of the Charity Bazaar's Closing: The Charity Bazaar for Relieving Students Unable to Attend School, organized by four groups, has now been declared closed after more than a month of active organization and accounting. Once the scholarships for each school have been collected, a full account will be published in the newspapers. The charity bazaar was originally launched to assist this session's education assistance fund of the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao. Now that the two newspapers' education assistance fund for this session has concluded, the work of relieving students unable to attend school can also temporarily come to an end. In addition to allocating funds to the two newspaper offices for education assistance, subsidizing the relief efforts for students unable to attend school by the two youth associations, scholarships for each school, and all expenses, a portion of the funds from this charity bazaar remains unused. Furthermore, some of the goods donated by various sectors have not been sold. The method for handling these goods and funds has been resolved by the Charity Bazaar Committee of the four groups on the 10th of this month, to be entirely handed over to the male and female youth associations for continued use in relieving students' living expenses. The two youth associations have now decided to use all the goods and funds as funding for their future student work-study loan programs. Detailed measures will be announced in the newspapers after they are finalized.</p>
<p>Air Raid Victim's Bequest for Education: "To Whom It May Concern: On December 19th of last year, during the tragic air raid in the Nanshi district, our hospital admitted an injured male unidentified person from Hugunying Road, who died due to the severity of his injuries before he could be treated. After consulting with nearby residents, no family members have come forward to claim the body. His situation is truly pitiful. We are now allocating the 10,000 yuan in cash (although a portion of it has been pierced by shrapnel, it is still usable) found on his body to the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao education assistance funds, with 5,000 yuan for each, to be used for social good. We are sending two attachments with 5,000 yuan in cash each. We respectfully request your receipt. Sincerely, Nanshi Municipal Hospital."</p>
