<h3>粵日軍續進　翁源樂昌境內殲滅戰</h3>
<p>粵漢前線基地十三日中央社電　攻佔韶關之日軍精銳部隊，嗣後復追擊向粵漢路東方地區潰退之敗殘渝軍。九日上午八時，於韶關東南方七十公里之翁源附近，殲滅渝軍五百餘。又自華中方面前進之日軍，亦於數日前，在坪石（樂昌西北方約廿公里附近）對渝軍二千，加以包圍殲滅中。</p>
<h3>日議會休會　完成協贊重責</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　議會目再開以來，連日展開眞摯之論議，對於八百五十億之臨時軍費以及明年度預算暨政府方面提出廿九件法案，已完成協贊之重責。衆院於八日貴院於十三日起，分別入於休會狀態，此後直至三月底爲止，遇事隨時開會。此次議會爲敵機頻襲下之議會，且爲所謂敵軍侵略菲律賓之最危急下召開之議會，故其所負使命，極爲重大。衆院於七日最後全體會議席上，通過決戰施策，督促政府，希望强力施行以軍需生產爲中心之政府各項施策，貴院亦於二日全體會議席上，通過完遂戰爭之決議案，督促政府施行强力施策，衆院決議之强化國內必勝體制問題，可謂國民決意之表現。又日政府此次局部改組，亦顯示强力實施議會所決施策之決意。</p>
<h3>中日滿三國　產業再配置　滿國務長官談</h3>
<p>新京十三日中央社電　滿洲國務長官武部氏，十二日陳述如下：中日滿之產業再配置問題，向立脚於更高之綜合的觀點，故滿洲國之戰力增强方策，亦即根據於此。易言之，爲完遂戰爭，必須增產原料及增產飛機等決戰兵器，蓋非如此不足以謀第一戰力之加强也。對於新理想之實現，則計劃建設機械工廠，並遷入日本工塲，關於此點，日本政府，亦曾宣稱積極予以援助，刻正急於推行中。然此項第一綫戰力增强之基礎，亦須建立於從來之鐵鋁，煤炭，木材及酒精等產業之上，因此更須擴大基礎產業，因之，滿洲國之責任愈趨重大。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>新春第一事</h3>
<p>昨天我們論及春節期內，大家應過節約生活，我們的意思是指目前是民族戰爭中的决戰時代，前方浴血，後方自應實踐戰時生活。不僅就義務上言應如此，就是從情感上言也應如此。光陰易逝，轉瞬春節期滿，在春節以後，我們認爲第一件事，應該是人口疏散了。</p>
<p>爲什麼要疏散？我們已經屢次說過。怎樣疏散？現在市政當局正在準備研究。同時，與交通當局及有關各方面取得密切聯繫。那末，疏散的實施，不久即將開始，已無問題。首先希望各慈善團體如福幼慈幼養老等等，從速準備疏散，貴乎自動，不必被動。同時，希望市民諸君乘此春節將逝之際，各就本身環境，充分考慮疏散問題。譬如：</p>
<p>（一）雖在上海有固定職業，而家庭人口較多的，就須準備將家庭中的老弱婦孺先行疏散，在原籍如有房屋田地，因舉家在滬而賃出者，就須交涉收回，以備返鄕後使用。在原籍房屋田地如有損壞荒蕪者，就須修葺整理。</p>
<p>（二）在上海並無固定職業，過去惟依囤貨牟利或作投機賣買的庽公生活者，這輩人當初大多數都因爲原籍戰事波及，避難來滬，所以他們在原籍都是有產階級，現在回鄕在生活上絕無問題的。</p>
<p>總之，上海的物價比鄕村高，空襲的危險又比鄕村多，爲本身生活安全着想，凡不必要居住上海者，都須疏散歸鄉。另方面各地的治安問題，當然應由政府負責確保。</p>
<h3>西里西亞工業區　鏖戰進行中　蘇軍企圖包圍布萊斯勞</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央肚電　海通社訊：東綫職事重心，現在拉的爾與格羅頓茲之間，下西里西亞戰事尤烈。其南比里茲·普萊斯·與接利煦·沃斯特勞區亦有激戰。哥尼夫之計劃，爲包圍布萊斯勞，使之孤立無援，蘇軍一支由布利格奧勞橋頭堡推進，又一支則由史達諾橋頭堡向里格尼茲推進，顯有會師包圍布萊斯勞之企圖，但被德鐵甲車隊所阻。</p>
<h3>三頭會議結束　發表公報</h3>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　英美蘇三國首腦，自二月四日以來，於克里米亞半鳥之耶爾太地方舉行會談，業已告畢，頃發表聯合公報，要點如次：（一）對禮國作戰，三國首腦考慮決定對共同敵人之作戰計劃，三國軍事代表經連日會談，關於自東西南北進攻德心臟部之新攻勢時期範圍及調整，已擬有詳細計觀，三國軍事會談，今後將視必要而隨時舉行。（二）關於對納粹德國履行無條件投降條項之政策及計劃，業已一致。關於德軍對聯合各國之損失要求賠償，於現物爲決定賠償範圍，特設委員會於莫斯科。（一）國際安全保障體制，根據聯合國緊密之協力，在廢除政治經濟上戰爭原因之目的下，爲檢討鄧巴頓奧克斯會議之非公式提案，定四月廿五日於舊金山舉行聯合國會議，在未邀請參加之前，先與重慶政權及特戈爾政權協議，然後由五國邀請聯合各團出席會議。鄧巴頓　克斯會議中，關於制裁侵略國之投票辦法，雖未　一致，然在此次會議中，當能打被難關。關於對「解放」各國之政策，三國首關已簽訂宣言，其主要意義乃基於民主主義之原則。</p>
<p>出席人員</p>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電　參加三國會議之主要人員如下：（一）美國方面爲國務卿史蒂丁紐斯，總參謀長李希上將·租借案行政員霍浦金·陸軍參謀長馬歇爾將軍·駐蘇大使哈里曼·國務院歐洲司長月修士·（二）英國方面爲外相艾登·戰時運輸大臣黎塞斯·駐蘇大使寇爾·外部當務次官賈德幹·參謀總長勃魯克元帥·空軍參謀畏波爾寨元帥·海軍次長克寗漢上將·地中海區協約軍總司令亞歷山大元帥及威爾遜元帥。（三）蘇聯方面爲外委長莫洛托夫·海委長顧茲奈索夫上將·陸軍副參謀長安托奈夫將軍·外次德興斯基·邁斯基·駐英美大使古　夫及格洛米柯。</p>

<h3>市財局發表　義演免捐辦法　申請手續上應注意各點</h3>
<p>本市財政局以本市各慈善團體及各學校，因籌募基金，或舉辦公益事業之義演事項，呈請財政局請求免徵娛樂捐，均未依照手續辦理，現財政局已決定嚴格處理，嗣後如有呈請免捐情事，應注意下列各點：（一）凡各慈善團體及各學校舉辦義演之各種球賽，或其他表演時，應先將門劵於十日前送請財政局執照科（江西路一八七號）蓋戳，並將表演性質一併函達財政局備查。（二）上項各團體及各學校呈請免捐，亦應先將捐款繳足，取得財政局收據後，再逕呈市府請求免捐。（三）市府核准後，即令知財政局辦理領款手續，由財政局通知各該請求免捐團體及各學校，具文派員帶同印鑑，逕赴財政局具領。</p>
<h3>本市銀錢業　變更放欵方式　去年業務盈餘爲數可觀</h3>
<p>本市銀錢各業在中央儲備銀行指導之下，經銀錢兩業同業公會之督促，業務日臻推進，基礎益趨鞏固，去年（三十三年）度各行莊均已循人正軌營業。各銀行之放款，素以往來透支爲主體，蓋開往來戶者多係工商業之廠號，其信用狀况爲銀行所明悉，平時收受存款，必要時予以資金融通之便利。又因工商各業門類不同，此一業多款之日，適爲他一業需款之時，銀行介居其間，爲週轉之樞紐，正可運用目如。惟前（三十二）年度各銀行往來之透支，於年關大結束時，客戶任意拖欠，不予償還，爲維護資金之週轉，避免本息之損失，特改絃更張。自去年度起放款業務，除定期放款外，多由往來透支改爲票據貼現。如客戶申請放款，持以票據簽訂契約，幷提供擔保品，放款期限縮短爲一星期，或半個月，最多期限爲一個月，施行以來，頗見成效，對於放款範圍，亦加以限制，其放款利息，視物價情形逐步提高。各銀行營業逐次改善後，去年業務盈餘額，頗稱不惡。</p>

<p>市警察局定於今（十四）日在該局八樓會堂舉行局務會議，將由周兼局長親自蒞臨主持，各處長均須參加，對警察業務之推進以及改善員警待遇，將詳加商討。</p>
<p>警察福利社已成立</p>
<p>周兼局長爲强化警察消費合作社採配物資事宜，改組爲警察福利社，並撥給一萬萬元爲擴充資金，人事方面亦經調整。該社業經成立，前消費合作社之一切社務，已由前經理丁政言於前日正式與新任經理滿其蔚移交完竣，嗣後對警察日用必需品，將統謀合理採配。</p>
<h3>保長辦事處　改設住家內</h3>
<p>本市警察局保甲處，爲便利市民在申報移動及各項保甲上問題起見，爰特令知各該區聯保轉知各保，將保長辦事處改移於保長本人住家內，毋須向外設處，則今後保長工作，不但易於指揮，且便利市民，對於辦事處經費支出，亦可撙節不少。</p>
<h3>財部今年起開征　賽馬所得稅</h3>
<p>財政部所得稅處上海區征收局，爲推進稅收增裕國庫收入起見，本年度决嚴格執行各類所得稅之實施催征，並擬試辦征收一時營利所得稅，對於跑狗塲及賽馬，决於本年度起征收所得稅，聞賽馬所得稅征收問題，已經與有關當局商洽决定，並委由上海體育會代征。</p>

        <h1>1945.02.14</h1>
<h3>Elite Japanese Troops on Moro Island: Complete Surprise Landing, Inflicting Significant Damage on Enemy Airbase</h3>
<p>Southern Front, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - An elite unit led by a certain unit of the Japanese army, in response to operations, secured a stronghold in the dense forests of Morotai Island. They fearlessly thrust forward, shocking the enemy. The Japanese army's assault completed a surprise landing on Morotai Island on the 10th, inflicting significant damage on the enemy and is currently destroying the enemy air base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 12th, a Japanese naval unit sank an enemy submarine in the Central Pacific. On the same day, a Japanese air unit also sank an enemy submarine in the western waters of Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Guangdong Continue Advance: Annihilation Battles in Wengyuan and Lechang</h3>
<p>Guangdong-Hankou Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The elite Japanese troops who captured Shaoguan subsequently pursued the defeated and scattered Chongqing army retreating towards the eastern region of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. At 8:00 AM on the 9th, they annihilated over 500 Chongqing troops near Wengyuan, 70 kilometers southeast of Shaoguan. Furthermore, Japanese troops advancing from the Central China area also encircled and annihilated approximately 2,000 Chongqing troops near Pingshi (about 20 kilometers northwest of Lechang) a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Adjourns: Completes the Important Task of Cooperation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the resumption of parliament, earnest discussions have been held daily. The parliament has completed the important task of cooperating on the 85 billion yen temporary military expenditure, the next fiscal year's budget, and 29 bills submitted by the government. The House of Representatives adjourned on the 8th and the House of Peers on the 13th, and will remain in recess, convening at any time until the end of March if necessary. This parliament was convened under frequent enemy air raids and during the most critical period of the so-called enemy invasion of the Philippines. Therefore, the mission it bears is extremely important. At the last plenary session on the 7th, the House of Representatives passed decisive measures and urged the government to strongly implement various government policies centered on military production. The House of Peers also passed a resolution to complete the war at its plenary session on the 2nd, urging the government to implement strong measures. The issue of strengthening the domestic victorious system, as resolved by the House of Representatives, can be said to be a manifestation of the nation's determination. Furthermore, the recent partial reorganization of the Japanese government also demonstrates its determination to strongly implement the policies decided by the parliament.</p>
<h3>Industry Re-Allocation Among China, Japan, and Manchukuo: Talk by Manchukuo State Minister</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Manchukuo State Minister, Mr. Takebe, stated on the 12th as follows: The issue of industry re-allocation among China, Japan, and Manchukuo is based on a higher comprehensive perspective. Therefore, Manchukuo's war effort enhancement strategy is also based on this. In other words, to complete the war, it is necessary to increase the production of raw materials and decisive weapons such as aircraft, as this is the only way to strengthen the primary war effort. To realize the new ideal, there are plans to construct a machinery factory and relocate Japanese factories. Regarding this point, the Japanese government has also declared that it will actively provide assistance and is currently urgently promoting this. However, the foundation for this primary line of war effort enhancement must also be built upon existing industries such as iron, aluminum, coal, timber, and alcohol. Therefore, it is even more necessary to expand the basic industries, and as a result, Manchukuo's responsibility is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The First Thing in the New Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we discussed how everyone should live frugally during the Spring Festival period. Our intention was to point out that we are currently in a decisive era of national war. While the front lines are shedding blood, the rear should naturally practice wartime living. This should be the case not only in terms of obligation but also in terms of emotion. Time flies, and the Spring Festival period will soon be over. After the Spring Festival, we believe that the first thing that should be done is population evacuation.</p>
<p>Why should we evacuate? We have said it repeatedly. How should we evacuate? The municipal authorities are currently preparing to study this. At the same time, they are establishing close contact with the transportation authorities and relevant parties. In that case, the implementation of evacuation will begin soon, and there is no question about it. First, we hope that all charitable organizations, such as those caring for infants, orphans, and the elderly, will prepare for evacuation as soon as possible. It is better to be proactive than reactive. At the same time, we hope that all citizens will take advantage of this passing Spring Festival period to fully consider the issue of evacuation based on their own circumstances. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Those who have a fixed occupation in Shanghai but have a large family should prepare to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children in their family first. If they have houses and land in their hometown that they leased out because their entire family was in Shanghai, they should negotiate to reclaim them for use upon returning home. If the houses and land in their hometown are damaged or neglected, they should repair and renovate them.</p>
<p>(2) Those who do not have a fixed occupation in Shanghai and have previously relied on hoarding goods for profit or speculative trading mostly came to Shanghai to escape the war in their hometown. Therefore, they were mostly property owners in their hometown, and there will be absolutely no problem with their livelihood upon returning home.</p>
<p>In short, prices in Shanghai are higher than in the countryside, and the danger of air raids is also greater than in the countryside. For the sake of their own safety, anyone who does not need to live in Shanghai should evacuate and return home. On the other hand, the government should, of course, be responsible for ensuring the security situation in various places.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Silesian Industrial Region: Soviet Army Attempts to Encircle Breslau</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The North Sea News Agency reports: The focus of operations on the Eastern Front is currently between Lahde and Grottkau. The battles in Lower Silesia are particularly fierce. There is also fierce fighting in the areas south of Brieg, Preis, and Järisch-Wüstegiersdorf. Konev's plan is to encircle Breslau and isolate it. One Soviet force is advancing from the Brieg-Ohlau bridgehead, and another is advancing from the Steinau bridgehead towards Liegnitz, apparently attempting to converge and encircle Breslau, but they are being blocked by German armored vehicle units.</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference Concludes: Communiqué Issued</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The meeting of the heads of state of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, held in Yalta, Crimea, since February 4th, has concluded.

<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Announces: Procedures for Tax Exemption for Charity Performances: Points to Note in the Application Procedures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau states that various charitable organizations and schools in the city have requested the Finance Bureau to exempt them from entertainment taxes for charity performances held to raise funds or for public welfare projects, but they have not followed the procedures. The Finance Bureau has now decided to handle this strictly. In the future, if there are requests for tax exemption, the following points should be noted: (1) For various ball games or other performances held by charitable organizations and schools for charity, the tickets should be sent to the License Section of the Finance Bureau (No. 187 Jiangxi Road) for stamping ten days in advance, and the nature of the performance should be sent to the Finance Bureau for filing. (2) Charitable organizations and schools requesting tax exemption should first pay the full amount of the donation and obtain a receipt from the Finance Bureau before submitting it directly to the Municipal Government for tax exemption. (3) After the Municipal Government approves the exemption, it will notify the Finance Bureau to handle the refund procedures. The Finance Bureau will notify the relevant organizations and schools requesting the exemption to send a representative with a written document and seal to the Finance Bureau to collect the refund.</p>
<h3>Money Shops in the City: Changing Loan Methods: Considerable Business Surplus Last Year</h3>
<p>Under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank and the supervision of the Money Shops Guild, the business of various money shops in the city is progressing day by day, and the foundation is becoming more and more solid. Last year (1944), each shop operated in an orderly manner. The loans of various banks have traditionally been based on current account overdrafts. Most of those who opened current accounts were factories and businesses in the industrial and commercial sectors, and the banks were well aware of their credit status. They usually accept deposits and provide them with financing facilities when necessary. Moreover, because the industrial and commercial sectors are different, the days when one sector has excess funds are precisely the times when another sector needs funds. Banks, situated in the middle, act as a hub for turnover and can operate freely. However, in the previous year (1943), when various banks closed their current account overdrafts at the end of the year, customers arbitrarily defaulted and did not repay them. In order to maintain the turnover of funds and avoid losses of principal and interest, special changes were made. Since last year, in addition to fixed-term loans, loan business has mostly been changed from current account overdrafts to bill discounting. If a customer applies for a loan, they sign a contract with the bill and provide collateral. The loan term is shortened to one week or half a month, with the maximum term being one month. The implementation has been quite effective, and the scope of loans has also been restricted. The loan interest rate has been gradually increased based on the price situation. After the operations of various banks gradually improved, the business surplus for last year was quite good.</p>

The promotion of police affairs and the improvement of police treatment will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Police Welfare Society Established</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the allocation of materials for the police consumer cooperative, Director Zhou, who is also the mayor, reorganized it into the Police Welfare Society and allocated 100 million yuan to expand the capital. Personnel were also adjusted. The society has been established. All affairs of the former consumer cooperative were officially handed over by the former manager, Ding Zhengyan, to the new manager, Man Qiwei, the day before yesterday. In the future, the society will plan the rational allocation of daily necessities for the police.</p>
<h3>Neighborhood Chief's Office Relocated to Home</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate citizens' reporting of changes of address and other neighborhood matters, the Municipal Police Bureau's Neighborhood Administration Office has specially notified the joint neighborhood administrations in each district to inform each neighborhood to relocate the neighborhood chief's office to the neighborhood chief's own home, without the need to set up an office elsewhere. In the future, this will not only make it easier to command the neighborhood chief's work but also facilitate citizens. It will also save a considerable amount on office expenses.</p>
