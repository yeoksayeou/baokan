<h3>上海的四項問題</h3>
<p>— 柳雨生</p>
<p>最近上海的政治，因爲人事更變和民衆的期望普遍增高的關係，顯得明朗化了起來。但是其實上海還是上海，上海政治上所需要應付解決的許多難題，在過去人們所期待的，也還是今不異昔，除了灘底的改革刷新，不容易一新耳目，而澈底的改進，却又談何容易。不過今日民衆所受到的不必要的苦痛，已經滲透感觸到每一個人的心頭，並且日漸艱深，民衆對於光明的要求，非惟可說是嗷嗷待哺，簡直是遑遑然不可終日。所以自前推動上海方面的市政，辦得好時芷如『雪中送炭」，非但可以獲得廣大的同情擁護，而且是倘不如此結果勢必至於火熱水深，地坼山崩，無從收拾！我們仔細分析當前滬市的重大問題，約可略分爲時，地，人，事這四項。</p>
<p>第一項是「時間」問題。現在不知是什麼日子，許多人談起生活來總是搖頭嘆氣，覺得一天過得不如一天，若要獲求解救，只有夢求將來的總解決。但是我們以爲所謂總解決的辦法究竟怎樣，沒有人可以澦測，而目前民衆們的痛苦，部的確非愈提早愈好的給他一個總解決不可。並且這個總解決，是有整個計劃推動的也好，由各負實當局部分的改革也好，總之有誰能够把人民的這是現在的行政官吏公務人員們對國家民族功罪的公平紀錄。以最平常的老百姓立塲來講，政治技術的前後緩急，錯粽複雜，抱負見解的磊落光大，異途同歸，固然是他們所瞭解信賴的，而誰最能够愛護自己國家的尊嚴，不辭犧牲勞瘁，以已飢己溺的精神，爲人民解倒懸謀福利，當尤爲他們推崇傾心的依歸。惟其是因爲時艱世危，一切的關鍵繫於政局的策進，所以人們對政治的期望心才更殷更切，惟其是因爲時間迫切間不容　，市政當局和他的幹部們肯抱了很大的決心來雷厲風行，才最容勿得到普遍的同情。</p>
<p>其次是「地」的問題和「事」的問題。現在的上海特別市的轄區，輻圓遼廣，除了市區和郊區而外，還包括了南匯，奉賢，寶山，嘉定，崇明，川沙，申江等七縣。我們平常所著眼的問題，如警察的非法敲索，稅收的舞弊營私，交通的阻塞困滯，配給的稀少遲延，以及物價的飛漲，囤戶的居奇，都是和每一個市民的福利攸關的事的問題。譬如配給能够不脫期，數量有增無减；物價能合理的增漲，通貨價值穩定；火車票黑市消除，軍僮車堂訓練厲行整頓；財政增加稅收；警察決無勒索：一項一項的實現起來，直接固然有利於民衆的生活需求，間接自然也會增高政府的威信，加强戰時的生產力量。然而這僅是治標的一方面。欲談治本，不能不考慮到上海市的外圍，即縣區和郊區的民衆苦痛。郊區接近市區，較易爲力，而縣區地域廣闊，海港交叉，除了政府辦事處（如縣政府區公所鄕鎭公所）所在地而外，往往還有兩個形式上的政府，也有遊擊隊，也要納稅完糧，也在辦敎育，事實上有些區域，民衆還並不在縣政府統轄範圍之內。地方上的土劣固然不用提了，各縣的催徵吏，區鄕鎭長，也往往有「路路通」的資格。可是，談到軍警的政治認識，待遇配備，公務人員敎育工作者的生活安定，輯撫洗亡，我們這一方面的情况，在過去實在是瞠乎其後。所以政府三大施策的所謂確保治安肅正思想兩點，根本不容易實行，至於增加生產，也因種種關係，農村幾頻破產，貪污橫斂巧取豪奪時有所聞，也不知道做到了幾分。道是『地」的問題，才是今日市政上最大的隱憂。</p>
<p>人是政治動物，政治是衆人的事情，所以欲謀改革，其主要的癥結尤在於「人』的問題。怎樣認識政府的國策和時局的重心，大家拚着犧牲個人來換取國家民族的自由獨立，道是鍛鍊人的思想。怎樣提高軍警公務人員敎育工作者的待遇，增加戶口配給數量，強化生產機構調整電力，這是安定人的生活。怎樣剷除土劣，肅淸貪」污，大刀闊斧的去劈開一條廉潔政治的新路，養成弊絕風淸的聲氣，這是樹立人的品格。時，事，人，地這四項問題的關聯性，就是我們期望用上海做出一個榜樣，給全國的同胞們看看，全面和平的實現不是沒有可能的。</p>
<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>疏散人口之幾個先決問題</h3>
<p>— 須維周</p>
<p>過去當空襲之後，防空當局之談話，以疏散人口爲防空必要之措置。常米價飛漲之後，市政當局之談話，又以疏散人口，對市民婉言勸告。最近各報，對於疏散人口，主張一致。以今日上海市民，處於空襲與生活威脅之下，政府縱不施行强制疏散人口之方法，然在並不需要留居於上海與感受生活威脅之人民，欲自動回鄉，數必不少。但因保甲移動麻煩，交通不便，沿途檢查留難，以及內地地方上之橫征暴歛，在在使欲自動疏散者，視爲畏途，抱定一動不如一靜之心理。至於空襲之威脅，一則對於眞正空襲之悲慘狀况，尚乏　確之想像，故外人每以空襲時，路上行人並不减少相竊笑。二則聽天由命，生死大數，爲千百年來祖宗遺傳處亂世時之要訣。有以危險相勸者，必視爲貪生怕死，甚或視爲神經病。並有以上海人口五百餘萬，有身價者，不知凡幾，以反唇相識。更有以彩票之頭獎相比喻者。故空襲之威脅，影響於市民心理者，尚不致十分恐慌。惟米價與日用必需品之飛漲，此燃眉之急，誠足以使稍有遠慮者，速謀遷地爲良之計。故當局如能於下述各問題，略爲盡力，則一舉手之勞，即可鼓勵不需要居留於上海與感受生活威脅之市民，向各處自動疏散。其於防空之便利，以及緩和物價之上漲，不無裨益。蓋上海爲全國經濟之中心，上海物價之高漲與回落，均足以刺激全國各地之物價。若就筆者認爲疏散人口之幾個先決問題，分述如后：</p>
<p>（一）保甲移動　對於申請領取回鄕證或移動證，自戶長而甲長·保長·警察局，每一處蓋印，應儘速辦理，如有留難或勒索情事，一經查實，予以嚴懲。各區保甲部分，應設一移動詢問處，如有目不識丁，或不知手續者，以申請回鄕移動事務詢問者，應舉實相告。或代塡各種申請書，並代定火車或輪船票，辦事人員應不辭煩厭，以和藹態度應付之。</p>
<p>（二）水陸交通　疏散路徑，暫以陸路之京滬滬杭二路，水路之內河與中華兩航路，着手試辦，因爲上述各路沿綫鄕村，生活費用確較上海路低。至其疏散方法，例如京滬路指定每日上午某時班慢車爲疏散人口之專車，車票由警局保甲處代售，編號發售，對號入座。輸船則每一個月中指定若干班，售票方法與火車相同。每一疏散回鄕者，隨帶行李及加收費用，均經規定，不准額外需索。經售車票與船票之保甲辦事人員，如有徇情行賄，或不依先後次序，一經查實，應予嚴懲。</p>
<p>（三）警軍檢查　對於疏散人口之專車或專輪，警軍檢查，可避免者設法避免之，否則當以極迅速之方法施行。例如內河輸船於北莊與記王廟兩埠，風雨無阻，須令旅客登岸排隊，逐一檢查，亟應改善。</p>
<p>（四）內地之佈置　內地風氣不同，對於外地來客，不無歧說之處。如租賃房屋，若非事前妥爲佈置，則非出以極高之小費不可。即換領居住證，縱手續極端完備，亦有許多不方便之處，應請各地當局在各地設立招待所，事前妥爲佈置，務使疏散人口，减除痛苦。</p>
<h3>安定首都軍警生活　當局擬定辦法　妨害供求者決處極刑</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　戰時下物資缺乏，乃爲必然現象，物價上漲而生活費用之提高，亦爲必然趨勢。邇來中樞當局有「首都物資平價維紀委員會」之成立，其主旨在使京市生活必需物資之恢復正常，保持穩定，並對軍警憲之待通，予以普遍提高以使其生活安定，安心服務，俾使澈底協助當局維持物價之抑平。茲悉該項具體辦法業已擬定，係調查最近之物價，統計每人每月最低之生活費用，除其每月原得薪餉外，並發給補助費，其中家隔在京者，並給予直系親屬贍養津貼。此外尚有俸米，柴薪等之發給，預料一般軍警憲之生活得此補助後，定能趨於安定，對於今後風紀之維持，及抑平物價之協力，殊有裨益。</p>
<p>維紀委會機構決定</p>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　自首都物資平價維紀委員會組成以後，其內部臨時機構之組織，樊已大致決定，會以下設秘書室，並設「點放」「燃料」「督察」「軍法」四組，分別職掌專責。其中督察組，舉凡對於七項生活物資之洗通及其有關地帶，決將厲行分區分項嚴密之督察活動。軍法組爲承審機關，得適用陸海空軍刑法及戰時刑事特別法，公務員犯　治罪各例及刑法等，對於生活必須物資七項，凡以强暴脅迫詐術或其他不法行動足以妨害其供求關係，以致影響市上發生不良現象者，當以戰時軍令特處以死刑。如有以圖獲得不法利益非法勒索捐款，或利用權勢，以强暴脅迫詐術或其他不法罪行，以勒取人民財物者，無論奸商或公務員，均分別處以死刑，或無期徒刑或十年以上有期徒刑。</p>
<p>猪隻來源設法疏通</p>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　當局對於米柴油攘蔬菜猪肉等七項，擬定平價維紀方案以後，其中對於猪肉一項，亦有規定。綠猪肉價格之高漲，除因津浦沿綫以交通關係不克遝京外，其重要之因素，爲猪隻公營社辦理不完善所致，刻當局已明令公營社暫行停止活動一個月，暫且許可猪隻得以自由出入販賣，並由市政府予以合理之估價，當局擬試辦一月，觀其成效如何，再行決定措置，想今後京市猪隻之來源，必因此而暢通，價格亦將因此趨於低落。</p>
<h3>皖省長視察　各軍警機關</h3>
<p>蚌埠二十七日中央社電　林省長兼綏靖主任蒞任後，對於皖省軍警機關及工作進展，甚爲關懷，偕綏署郭參謀長范政務所長伍警務處畏陳副官處長等，分別視察省府特務團·行政幹部學校·省保女敎導團·警士敎練所·省立蚌埠醫院等機講，對各校訓練工作，垂詢頗詳，並視察最近擴大之修械所，對該所設備及工作情形頗表滿意。</p>
<h3>傳羅斯福就　對德計劃</h3>
<p>瑞典京城廿七日中央社電　海通社訊，倫敦新聞紀事報紐約通訊員評羅斯福之將來計劃稱：羅氏（一）預備接受法國爲英華蘇之成熟盟國，（二）預備以東普魯士之一部份劃與蘇聯，（三）德西部工業區一部份劃與法國，（四）接受蘇聯所提以德人建設被戰爭所毀蘇聯城市。美國決永久控制德國，封閉其化學五金廠及人造燃料廠。</p>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊，德外部發言人昨談稱：德外部尚不知羅斯福總統是否已離美國前往參加三國會議，但或屬可能，蓋國務卿史蒂丁紐斯似已離開華盛頓</p>
<h3>西里西亞地區　德蘇坦克大戰　東普魯士聯絡綫截斷</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍坦克車隊在西里西亞發動猛烈反攻後，格蘭維資（Gleiwitz在克拉科西北附近之坦克車大戰愈演愈烈，向東北方前進之蘇軍裝甲　約百輛，遭遇德軍坦克車之迎戰，迫其步步後退。蘇軍另一部移師東指，亦遭德軍之反攻。格蘭維資城之外國。與興登堡（在格蘭維資之東）以北德軍扼守陣地，以抗蘇軍之壓力，進入格蘭維資迤西之蘇軍坦克車一隊幾全被殲。俄伯痕西方與勃萊斯勞以南，發生爭奪沃特河缺口之大戰，蘇軍在該河西岸所立之小橋頭，遭德軍砲隊之猛轟，蘇軍橋頭二處昨被德軍消滅。過去廿四小時以來，蘇軍增調大軍進入勃萊斯勞區，德軍在該城以東佔領新陣地，勃萊斯勞以北蘇軍側面行動，被德軍擊退。</p>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社電：上西里西亞之蘇軍繼續推進，在格來維茲與布利格之間，迫近沃特河，蘇軍陣綫成半圓形，以布萊斯勞爲中心目標。彼森區內，蘇軍之情勢，尚難臆斷，蘇軍步兵及大砲隊現向波森附近移動，究竟突襲之目標如何，尚難確定。</p>

<h3>努力工作　肅正品行思想　周市長訓勉秘書處職員</h3>
<p>周市長於昨（二十七）日上午十時半在市府貴賓室，召集市府秘書處高級職員訓話，計到參事兼總會計處處長沈觀準，參事潘達，凌憲文，王德言，簡任秘書葛玉九（兼第一組組長），楊實（兼第二組組長），梁森章（兼第三組組長），凌大珽（兼第四組組長），秘書湯育浩，劉朗吉，總務科科畏曹今港，專員兼印刷所所長孫光第等四十餘人，周市長於逐一垂詢各人略歷後，即席致訓，茲錄原意如次：</p>
<p>「本人此次權任上海市長，決心將上海市政刷新一下，自需由各主管局處各自負責去執行任務，但本府秘書處比一家工廠的最大原動力，如原動力本身不先健全，無疑的要去推動各部份機器，使能活潑運用，是一件辦不到的事。敵本府秘書處實爲各局處的基礎，必須發動很大之原動力，才能推動所屬各機關。</p>
<p>希望兩點</p>
<p>本府秘畫處的人事情形，非常複雜，有舊市府及前一八兩區三部份人事合併之關係，各人之意志思想既不統一，在感情上也不十分融洽，裏面的人，內中不免有良　不齋之現象。過去外面對本處之指摘很不少，今後不問各人過去之歷史如何，在思想與意志上，必須統一起來，不管各人過去是那一機關的人，今後不可再存任何門戶之見。自羅秘書長到任以後，各位必須力自振作，統一思想意志，融洽大家感情，把過去種種偏見，一概打消，這是本人希望於各位的第一點。</p>
<p>第二點本人所所希望於各位的，本處應該站在積極態度的立塲，去推動市政，協力市政，那麽市政才能順利地推進，各機關才能接受本處的指導。要曉得本處是全市最高指導機關的幕僚，即是參謀本部，如果不積極的去用心思想辦法，而要希望指揮下屬各機關去改革市政，那是絕對不可能的，所以各位須站在最高指導機關的參謀人員資格，去積極推動事業，絕對不可採取消極的態度，去應付一切。</p>
<p>過去本處有種種不好的現象，譬如對於公文之處理，往往遲延很久，今後無論對於中央政府的命令，或者下屬機關的公文，都須迅速處理，上面的命令，固須迅速，對低下機關的公文，更要迅速，必須盡最大可能之速度，去改卷或傳達，公文處理之迅速與否，好比一個人身上血脈流通之速度一樣，人身上之血管流通迅速，他的身體，就十分健壯，反之，一個機關要是不能傳達公文，這個機關雖存而等於已死，希望大家今後對於公文處理，除了必要之外，切勿多延時日。</p>
<p>改革惡習</p>
<p>過去本府下屬機關尙本處請領經費，往往先要講條件，這是總會計處的事，不但請求臨時經費，要講條件，就是領經常費時，亦須講好條件，打一個折扣，這是一個最可痛恨的事，今後絕對不准再有此事，否則是一定要依法嚴厲處分的，這是絲毫不能客氣的。再過去對於買東西慌報慮帳，響如買一百元錢的東西，其中八十元是假的帳，拿來大家分掉，而公家祇拿了二十元錢的東西，這簡直太不成話，今後絕對不准再有此種可恥之現象，倘再有此事，一經查實，立即送到法院嚴辦，決不寬容。此外，此種風氣一旦習以爲常，再繼續下去，今後本處的人，以及整個市府人員，都要被人民看不起，即整個市府亦被人民　不起，那時本人亦無面子再做市長矣。關於這點，負責購買等人員，特別要謹愼小心，再有此種不良事件發生，一定要拿決律嚴格制裁的。</p>
<p>奮發自肅</p>
<p>最後希望各位都本着自己良心，站在最高市政指導機關的參謀人員的地位，一方面努力工作，一方面肅正品行思想，使上海市政開一新紀元，對社會人羣有所貢獻，就是對自己，亦能造成穩固之社會地位，得到各方面光榮之批評。希望各位都本着有則改之無則加勉之古訓，努力奉行，那麼才能對得起個人與政府，於國家社會才有交代，否則這樣糊裏糊塗的混下去，也沒有什麽好處，不如自動的奮發自肅做一番光榮之事業，對得起國家民族」。</p>
<h3>京都帝大同學會　歡迎周市長</h3>
<p>日本京都帝國大學上海同學會，鑒同學周市長新主滬政，爲表示歡迎起見，特於昨日下午四時半假都城飯店，舉行歡迎茶會，到木村增太郎等中日同學百餘名，周市長準時蒞臨後，即由木村會畏代表致歡迎辭，略謂：周市一長爲近代中國政治家，中國之前途，實賴大政治家之實行力及堅強信念，今周市長出長滬政，我們同學實不勝表示歡迎之意。繼由周市長致詞除略述過去在鹿兒島京都時代之學生生活外，並陳述當時組織共黨，參加革命，及轉變思想之種種經過，最後就出長滬政，略謂：「本人最顯著之性格，即能說能行，說得到做得到，亦即爲余之決意。在籌備組織中央儲備銀行時，當時情况極爲困難，各方持反對論者亦極衆，然余認爲必須組織中央銀行，故不顧一切因難，排除一切反對之論，乃得成功，此即爲余個人之決心，此次出任滬市，各方情勢，更爲困難，然余經數十日之老慮，決心改善滬政，余決心定後，無論有何困雞，有何反對，決按照預定計劃，努力實行。今余譬如運動，余如在塲選手，各位一猶如場旁之後援隊，若欲競賽勝利，各位後援隊必須盡力後援而後可，前途荊棘正多，尙望各位能以同學資格多賜高見，多那援助」。周氏詞畢，由安井氏致詞，至六時始攝影散會。</p>

<h3>劉處長　談宣傳施政　昨舉行首次記者例會</h3>
<p>市宣傳處主持之記者例會，自新任處長劉德　氏蒞任後，昨（廿七）日下午二時半首次假市府會議室舉行，到本市各報社新聞記者十餘人，由劉處和長對今後宣傳處工作計劃，及一般實施情形，發表談話加次：</p>
<p>宣傳處係立於官方之指導宣傳機關，本人從事報人生涯，已有多年，此次奉令主持宣傳處，深盼各方協力。宣傳處所辦理者，偏重於有關宣傳之審查及登記事宜，前此因辦理審查登記手續，弊端百出，茲不必加以詳述，今後當秉承周市長羅秘書長意旨與決心，努力改正，絕對肅淸額外勒索情事。</p>
<p>一般出版刋物等登記方面，決定加以嚴格審查，遵照宣傳部及市府命令，絕不徇私，並擬今後使小型報亦刊載時事及戰事新聞，恊力於戰時宣傳。</p>
<p>新聞記者之重點配給問題，本人對此至爲關懷，物配處劉處長蒞任伊始，對記者重點配給，刻正積極整理中，惟一般新聞從業員，如經理人員等，亦屬恊力新聞者，似應一律加以配給，深盼新聞協會上海區分會加強工作，重點配給事宜，可由新聞協會上海分會審查，再交宣傳處執行接洽。各報社紙張問題，日形嚴重，刻正積極檢討，以謀解決。</p>
<p>答記者問</p>
<p>詞畢，各報社記者就本月廿五日下午五時，市保甲處茶會歡迎周市長等新任市政長官時，保甲處招待人員無理拒絕各報社新聞記者入塲採訪事，共同提出，向劉處長質問，並要求新聞採訪自由性之保障，當經劉處長詳加詢問，檢討良久。</p>
<h3>周市長囑司法官　嚴辦貪污案件　加強司法與行政配合</h3>
<p>本市局市長佛海，蒞任以來，決心整飭鋼紀，肅清貪汚，惟以司法機關，如不能與行政機關之政策相配合，則整飭之效，不易實現，日昨特約地檢署趙檢察長及地方法院馮院長而談，並以行政院副院長資格，切囑對於市府所送遠法凟職貧污等案件，不可隨意保釋，不可積　，不可寬縱，務以極敝捷嚴厲之方法檢察及裁判，預料今後司法與行政之配合，必可更行加强。</p>
<h3>新協滬分會　款宴劉處長</h3>
<p>新聞協會上海區分會昨（二十七）午宴請市府宣傳處新任處長劉德煊氏，並邀請宣傳處高級職員作陪，到該會理事長陳彬　，暨全體理事總幹事等，首由陳理事長致歡迎詞，繼由劉處長致答對今後新聞從業員重點配給，各報社紙張問題，及如何強化新恊會等各項，闡述頗詳。</p>
<h3>趙宣部長　抵滬公幹</h3>
<p>國府新任宣傳部長趙尊嶽，日前因公由京抵滬，聞將於于日內正式與本市各界相見。</p>
<h3>經濟局催領　積壓執照</h3>
<p>市經濟局許局長鑒於過去各業公司工廠商申請登記，其核准登記執照，積壓案伯爲數甚多，此實足妨礙工商業正當經營之權利保障，故將即通知各商廠，如實係正當經營及已辦理合法手續核准登記，而尙未領取營業登記執照者，即於限期內迅速持　收據，前往該局領取。</p>

<h3>雷伊泰島前線　肉彈戰勝了機械　河西哲行少尉談話錄</h3>
<p>雷伊泰島的職線，現已完全犬牙相錯了。企圖確保海烽線的美軍，於西海岸推進舟艇襪動戰，並進窺奧爾莫克，但陸續登岸的美軍，因遭日軍猛攻，未能互相　絡，被隔爲數截，所以　伊泰西戰場上，兩軍交疊　綜，混戰不休。下面是最近從奮伊泰前線回到基地來的河西哲行少尉的談話錄，語雖簡略，亦可由此窺知電伊泰島日美兩軍決戰狀况的一斑。</p>
<p>輕裝疾進</p>
<p>我在奧爾莫克上岸以後，則隨部隊向卡里加拉方面北上。此次的上陸作戰，非常順利。從距岸的一公里左右的海面，用舟艇戰卸兵器彈藥前進，士兵則涉水而行，海水沒到胸際。上陸作業費時兩晚，其間曾一度受到「統一」式機廿架的攻擊，但損害簡直沒有。前衛部隊當晚乘卡軍前進，我們也畫夜兼行，紅白屋頂相間的奧爾莫克，不久便落在我們老機的後面。我們在祇廣的坦蕩柏油道上前進。綠色的椰十林時時出現道傍，展開在灼熟的陽光之下。我們的部隊用人力拉着砲車在這條汽車路上行進。看到士兵們渾身是汗的光景，　希望有牽引車或馬匹等來代替他們，但賣際上我們爲了盡量多携大砲，馬和牽引車簡直沒有。而且食糧及携帶品等也極少極少，所以在上陸以後第四天，我們就須啃着乾麵包，喝着椰子汁，用芋艿及玉蜀黍充飢。</p>
<p>發現敵兵</p>
<p>第三日晨，我們受到P28型機十二三架的攻擊。飛得極低，用機關槍盤旋掃射，我們立刻應戰。這時，前鋒巳達里蒙的山頂，俯瞰三貓的海面，發見在卡包岡的前面集結着無數敵軍的上陸用舟艇。和我們新銳部隊的上陸相呼應，敵軍也在我們前方上陸一師以上的兵力。里　山頂附近，猛浴着敵軍的迫　砲彈，我們的戰鬥於是開始。敵軍的作戰是依仗着物質數量和機械的。他們在　伊泰島的戰鬥中，盡量使用着　迫擊砲和電波兵器。迫擊砲有相當大的口徑，其砲彈落下來的時候，能造成直徑二三米的孔穴。而且，此種重迫擊砲是由各種電波兵器操作描準的，只要有皮鞋展或鐵和鐵相擦的聲誓，敵軍的砲亂開起來。此外，敵軍還有一種奇特的觀測機，士兵們替它取了一個縴號叫「　蛉」，從早晨七時左右起，便在我們頭上盤旋。它是搭載二三人的單葉機，裝置着很大的無綫電天綫，飛得很慢，每小時的速力大的不到一百公里。當它在頭上翱翔時，如有炊烟上昇，不久使有敵方重迫砲射擊過來。此種「　蛉」大的用無綫電與各方面的砲兵　地連絡着的。有一次，我和兩名士兵一共三人，前往執行陣地偵察，偶然被「　蛉」發見，立即有敵方的迫擊砲彈光　，但是並不準義。又，無綫電信班的電織一勸，也會在其附近落下一陣　雨。不　，　彈雖打在極近的地方，　　却意外少，可見效力並不大。</p>
<p>敢死衝鋒</p>
<p>還有一點，就是敵軍充分使用長距　砲。他們從哈羅附近的重砲陣地向　爾莫克的市街射擊，投　多量的彈丸。奧爾莫克的市街，到了十一月中旬，已經化爲慶據，港中的棧橋也有一部分被砲火所毀。我們對於敵軍這種挑戰，以衝鋒敢死隊應戰，震撼敵陣，直搗其巢穴。衛鋒隊員穿軟底鞋，拿日本刀，握特製的長槍，並携若干手榴彈，於黑在潘入敵軍砲兵陣地。敵軍於密林中配置無數聽齊器，周圍架好機關槍，警戒不算不嚴，但我方敢死隊却能巧妙運用手榴彈，將其機關槍巢炸毀。我們的敢死獻幾乎　夜有　組衝入敵陣。敵兵一知敢死獻　進陣地，就紛紛抱頭魚實，四教逃命，讓我們的敢死隊悠悠然破壇其陣地而　。　方憑匪物　　機械而作成的防禦，一度實破以後，即成無用的臘物。</p>
<p>我方衝鋒敢死隊簡直沒有戰死者，眞正可　。幾乎與平日的演習一樣，非常成功。只在偶而有戰友陣亡時才想劃這是眞正的戰爭。出發衝鋒的士兵常說：「沒有再比衛鋒殺敵有味的事情！」這種　昻的意氣，深深參八生活於密林中的我們的心胸。在肉彈與鐵量的戰鬥中，肉彈的勝利實有籟於浩然的勇氣。</p>
<p>伊泰島上沒有可惡的瘧疾，水也比較　　。在無路的叢林中生活，對於訓練精良的我軍勇士，並無怎樣的不便和苦痛。至於食糧，則椰十賞，玉蜀委和芋艿　都很饒富，隨地可以找到。（　本特派員記．譯自十二月二十六日讀賣報知）</p>
<p>歐洲東綫形勢圖</p>
<p>東綫戰事，以上西里西亞奧東着魯士西南部爲劇。蘇方集中大軍進攻，德軍亦源源開往前綫增援，目下　尼斯堡·埃　平·但　·希尼台莫爾·托倫·布期堡·波森·布萊斯　等地均有激戰。</p>

<h3>獅子岩</h3>
<p>— 耶瑪</p>
<p>「你瞧，那個突出的山頭便是獅子岩。」</p>
<p>走過官道的行人都能　見那個獅子岩的，那是從與官道平行的一列山脈中　腰突出來的一個山頭。山顛高而峻險，頂山有一塊大岩石，不生草木，不知在什麽時候給誰言出它像個獅子的頭，於是「獅子岩」便成了它的正式的名字。岩下的那個只有七八家住戶的小村，也叫做獅子村了。</p>
<p>要上這個山頭，是須從那一列山脈那邊翩越而上的。除了伐木的樵夫與因山而得名的獅子古寺裏的香伙，偶而上去之外。獅子村中的鄉人很少有人上去的。因此山上樹木叢生，荊棘遍地，而且常右一走獻出沒其間。自從出現了一條雜色巨　嚇死了一個貪玩的小沙彌以後，那岩上更少有人敢上去了。鄉人們都互相警戒，上山的小徑也就被逐漸掩沒了</p>
<p>一次深晚，獅林古寺中的老和尙，方做完晚課，從大殿中走出來，抬頭望見獅子岩那邊有道似光非光，似霧非霧的帶狀之物，向天際矗起，直抵雲霄，於是一個奇玄神怪的念頭在他腦中生出，與過去看來的神怪小說中的情節相吻合，經他的嘴說了開去，人們便相傳獅十岩上有個劍仙在鍊丹，每天深晚時候的白光，便是他鍊丹時的劍光。有根底的世人方能　到，普通的肉眼是看不見的。於是，獅子岩更封上了一層神秘性。當初嚇死小沙彌的巨蟒也便被當作　守山頭的劍仙的守衛者了。</p>
<p>「你瞧，那個突出的山頭就是獅子岩。」</p>
<p>當鄕人們指點着獅子岩向行過官道的路人說的時候，語氣中是頗有神秘的意味的。假如你再問：</p>
<p>「獅子岩怎麼呢？」</p>
<p>於是，他便會告訴出一個憑空猜想，自巴杜造的玄奇的劍仙故事了。</p>
<p>不知那一年，從城寡來了一個晚年信佛修行懺悔的老人，帶了大批土太與工人，在山腰上樂了個小庵，築成以後，山腰的樹林中便添了一角紅牆，每當傍晚或是清晨，常有早晚課的鐘聲在山林中隨着漂渺的烟霧飄出，與山下的獅林古寺的鐘聲相互響應。也常有些獅林古寺的香客循便上山隨喜獅子岩遂也減却不少寂寞了。</p>
<p>五年，不，六年以後，那個靜心條行的老人無疾而終了。死後除了獅林古寺中的和尙每逢七頭上山去爲他唸經超度外，那老人身後竟也沒有家人前來料理。山上的小庵便變成了獅林古寺的上院，也住了一些打掃的香伙。一天，有個膽大的外來的遊客，不顧香火的勸阻，　險越上山頭去一換獅子岩的究竟，經他回來說：獅子岩只不過是塊較大的岩石而已。上面旣無草木，也無鳥獸。然而並無人相信他的報告。凡是有路人行過官道，鄉人們仍用神秘的聲調，指點着那個山頭說：</p>
<p>「你瞧，那個突出的山頭便是獅子岩。」</p>
<h3>寄明弟</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>我們原非暖室的花草，</p>
<p>包圍着膽弱的琉璃；</p>
<p>無意於牖下的泥沙，</p>
<p>你任滂沱的雨冲到天涯。</p>
<p>懷千里志，</p>
<p>奈無百里之騅！</p>
<p>且卓然挺立</p>
<p>迎肅殺的霜花。</p>
<p>行將三載了，</p>
<p>顚簸的生涯乃不止一千個畫夜，</p>
<p>廿二歲的少年頭白！</p>
<p>惟自身的衰弱是可悲的；</p>
<p>縱得千里駒，</p>
<p>你也將　鞭長涕悵望迢遙的雲烟。</p>
<p>賦一闕歸去來，</p>
<p>雖破落的家園在倦旅的游子總添上無窮溫暖。</p>
<p>爲什麽又不說了？</p>
<p>豈關山修阻弱山無渡，</p>
<p>還是怕跌碎了心頭的黃金夢？</p>
<h3>往情</h3>
<p>— 方宣</p>
<p>我是一個不會吸烟的人，但是偶然也抽上一枝，尤其是在黑夜裏。我愛它這一絲光亮和一圈一屬淡淡的浮烟，它們使我想得更遠更漂渺，忘記了人間的榮辱。</p>
<p>雖說我只有活過二十來歲，可是我的憂患就是五十歲的人都比不上。我是這樣早熟，而且這探多病，我在八歲的時候，走路還有時要跌倒。然而在十歲的時候，　到一個女孩子，已經覺得不好意思跟她親近了。</p>
<p>我是沒有童年的，似乎一離開母新懷抱，就知道什麼是呌做「煩惱」，我記得有一個詩人曾讚頌着當一個人二十歲左右的時候「黃金似的，値得一生寳貝！」然而我在這個歲數，却是話得頂徬徨，頂苦悶的時候！</p>
<p>在白日，我沉緬在自已的夢裏。我是多麼會做夢的人呵！我在夢裏悲泣，或是歡笑。在晚上，有人來點綴我的夢，我在夢裏感到心跳和面紅，有時氣急了，鳴鳴地哭出聲來……。</p>
<p>—自已年紀還輕呢，何必這樣躁急？</p>
<p>我把頭蒙在被裏，暗地裏思量。</p>
<p>但是，當我被一個不頂名譽的女孩子欺侮了以後，我是再也不能將自己的心情寗靜下來了。她看不起我所矜持着的，陶淵明在她眼裏看來是一個窮老頭兒。「一卷陶詩那裏有一枚鑽戒値錢！」（我記得她說這句話兒的時候，是用粉撲均勻着臉，把嘴角　成一條弧，白起了兩眼。）她醉心着一位能有好生活給她的「公子」。—這位「公子」的父新是在上海很說得起的，手下有着近萬的門徒，喝一聲「做」就把人攪得稀爛！</p>
<p>（我的心顫抖起來了，聽說這個女人產了一個女孩子以後，已經這到這位「公子」的遺　。如果我再有機會接近她，我該怎樣對待她？……）</p>
<p>就在這一年冬天，我離開了溫暖的家庭，到一座舉目無親的山城裏去生活。我用着生活的艱苦來忘記自已心頭的創傷。我並不爲自已的「失戀」而傷心，頂使我切齒切痛恨的，是我以爲遷就她，（她是什麼東西！）她却偏偏折辱了我的自尊心！</p>
<p>在這幾個月中，我跟從了一位「生活」的導師，從它那裏我體騐到了飢餓，寒冷和貧窮。我不再會爲一件人間小小的哀樂，而惹動感情了。</p>
<p>可是當我重回到上海，舊時的境物又激起了我的怨憤。我要報復！我要報復，然而，被我傷害的是一個多麼善良的孩子呵！</p>
<p>她是一向被我當作小妹妹的，她似乎還不很懂得人事，而且有些優。我記得，她有一次到我的課室裏來找我，被我的同學吃了幾句「荳腐」，書她哭得兩眼紅腫。當時，我覺得很好笑，那裏知道我隔了半年回來，竟榨取她的痛苦來舒暢我的創傷。</p>
<p>一天，我和她在客癮裏閒談，來了她的一位畏輩，我就告辭了出來。第二天，她打電話給我，希望我再倒她那裏去一次。當我一踏進她的家門，她就拍手頓足的笑了出來。</p>
<p>「有人問我，你是我的什麽客人？」</p>
<p>這呌我怎麼回答呢，我搖搖頭裝着優。</p>
<p>「你不知道，難道我知道麼！」</p>
<p>說着，她又笑了起來。</p>
<p>人是情感的動物，我不否認。當我覺得我也有些愛她的時候，我驚惕了起來：我不能够這樣，在開始了我就沒有什麼好心陽！於是，我借了她的一件小小任性的事情，就和她決絕了。</p>
<p>我心裏有一種說不出的罪疚，我不能够再安靜地住在家裏了。在一個雨雪交加的早晨，我又離開了上海。我在一個落後的商埠裏住了下來，這裏離開我的家鄉不遠，有着我的親戚和朋友。她們都很關心我，連一個頂喜歡喝酒的長輩也勸我少喝一些酒，不要把自己的身子糟場得太厲害。我是不很喜歡賭博的人，但是在這一個月中，我却瘋在地賭着。我已經輸得心在激烈地跳動，可是我還是顫抖着手，把袋裏的錢孤注一擲！</p>
<p>終於，我病倒了。每天發熱，皮膚上滿是風疹塊。起初我是請西醫看的，他的診斷是陽中毒，誰知注射了幾次從自已血管裏抽出來的血淸，仍舊沒有什麽效力，我不得不請敎中醫了。爲了煎藥的緣故，我移到一家親戚處去居住。</p>
<p>這家親戚本來和我是很近的，但是死去了一個和我有血統鑒係的主婦，我在這裏却變成很客氣的人客了。在廢歷除夕的一天，大表妹偷偷地對着她母親的遣像在流淚，連我走近她的身邊都沒有發覺。我輕聲地喊了她的名字，她在睫毛上帶着晶瑩的淚珠默默地望着我。</p>
<p>「這有什麽法子呢，她老人家會這樣短命！」</p>
<p>我的勸慰還沒有說完，他却放聲哭了起來。道使我手足無措了，我靠近了她的身體，握住了她的兩手。但是她不等我再開口，却掙脫了我的手，把我丟在房間裏走了！</p>
<p>—我的舉動有冒犯你的地方麼？</p>
<p>我幾次想這樣問她，然而我總沒有成功，我爲什麽要窘迫一個純潔的女孩子呢？我和她的生活習慣是不同的，我的道德標準也許她不能接受。所以直到現在。她已經替我生了一個孩子，我還不明白她當時的心情…。</p>
<h3>我愛吉他</h3>
<p>— 梅默之</p>
<p>牆角裏有我心愛的幽靜的樂器——吉他，我愛它的熾烈，比愛我自已强似萬倍。</p>
<p>它始終靜靜的躺在那黯淡的寂寞的牆角裏，用輪廓，就足够想像它眞實姿態的玲瓏美麗。</p>
<p>那牆角始終打掃得很乾凈，那地方本來可以安置張坐椅，或書架的，如今適宜的放置着這美妙的樂器，可以伴隨這屋子主人的冷靜。</p>
<p>我愛這吉他，因爲在這樣冷酷嚴冬的日子，失去了溫暖，失去了陽光，心境的惡劣，胸頭的　結，需要有一種童樂，來激發我的生命，來歌唱我的希冀，來寄托我無限的熱忱。</p>
<p>吉他，這幽靜而曼長的曲調，這輾盈而沉着的節奏，這幾根絲絃，可奏出我人所可以想像的悲壯，淒切，怨慕，沉痛，熱烈，愛憎，歡樂！</p>
<p>世界上有名的曲子，都將因爲有了它而長留於史乘，世界上多少悲歡離合的故事，都將成爲它彈奏的對象。</p>
<p>我愛它，正爲了它是最神聖的，聖潔的，是歷史的忠實的紀錄者，祗要想有這能力去向它學習，它將給您無上安慰。</p>
<p>當一個人在孤單寂寥，失去了母愛，破碎了憧憬的時候，將生命寄託在以使生命彈奏起應有的青春的樂譜。</p>
<p>於是我深深的愛着它，愈是嚴寒的深長，愈是冷酷的銳厲，愈是冰雪的逞威，我便愈發對這不阿世情的東西，培育起熾熱的愛忱。希望有一天借它的絲絃，彈奏出我此時的悲憤，熱望。</p>

<h3>三屆籃球聯賽精彩一幕　中北勝汕隊之評述　介紹甲乙組各隊實力</h3>
<p>第三屆上海籃球聯賽自前週開始以來，以甲甲組之俱屬滬上第一流　手所組織，甲乙組則均爲後起中之佼佼者。女子組則老隊與新興勁旅，極有進步之演出，無怪每賽情况熱烈。本週內當以週五（二十六日）晚中北勝汕隊之役，非特能盡球藝之發揮，且於精神及道德，兼具表掦，　一場滿意之收獲，故欣爲之評述焉。</p>
<p>按在申報盃中汕隊曾勝中北，此番中北果爾得雪此一箭之仇，談此戰局勢汕隊除上場以四對〇領前，不久即爲中北超出後，始終追隨於後。中北能控制一直領前之局面，實屬匪易。茲論中北勝因，汕隊失敗癥結。</p>
<p>陣綫支配得當　中北獲勝主因</p>
<p>中北現採用人釘人制，則對於　守對手之措置，應有極愼重之者慮，乃以卓國榮看林維聽，包松圓守陳淸江，及李震中管馬燦希，均爲對症下藥之調度。此點先爲取勝之主因，其輔因當屬臨陣之努力，球藝之得發揮。唯觀中北隊素稱北派宗匠，近時有牛皮糖之作風。所謂北派之敏捷，所謂北派之花巧眩人，僅爲偶有之表演，此固爲戰術之進境，但譽之者，則頌爲綜合南北之長，毀之者有謂掩住北派之特點爲遺憾耳。</p>
<p>汕隊雖遭敗績　演出極爲滿意</p>
<p>汕隊素以殺練及活潑見長，合作純熟著名，此戰對於上列二項，俱能有最　峯之演出。勝敗之另一件事，全隊五將士，生龍活虎，尤以紀南康之主持中帥，進退有序，竟亦有大將風範，馬燦希之籃下截却，在中北各長人中能利用其地位與時間，輒有驚人之作。綜評汕隊此戰，雖遭敗北，但確不失爲成功之一戰。</p>
<p>下週週三週末　又有二塲好賽</p>
<p>致下週內該聯賽甲甲組又有二塲最精彩之球賽，即週三（卅一日）爲華聯逢汕隊。週末（二月四日）中北華聯大鬥。查此三隊爲目下滬上之三巨頭，勢將各鬥智鬥勇，運用計謀，以愽獲得好評也。</p>
<h3>介紹甲乙組各隊之實力</h3>
<p>再者甲甲組及女組各隊，筆者上期曾加以記述，而甲乙組加入之八隊，允稱爲乙組之翹楚，後起之俊傑，故亦樂爲之在此作介紹。</p>
<p>中北乙　此番除原有陣容，復羅致前華南之李瑞雄，劉福善，明星之王鏡湖沈達，史久全，鄭國立等名將，實力之强，驟增數倍，蓋大有錦標非我莫麗之概。然論事實，以其若此之堅硬陣容。蹤橫該組，當屬可能。</p>
<p>東華　以足球名將之身手獻技於狹小之球房內，其氣力之够，綽乎有餘。况賣幼良，李垚，張邦綸，韓龍海等，俱屬雙棲各將，個中老手也。唯邇來似以注力足球，練習較少，故不能談其戰術及合作，僅恃乎其根底及氣力之可觀耳。但以該組中，亦唯東華足以成脅中北乙耳。</p>
<p>V隊　此一般小將，在吳子彬領導下，力圖卯上。故申報盃中曾參加甲組，雖忝列殿軍，但得益匪淺，祝明星夏萬尤爲傑出，故在該組中，大有名列前茅之希望。該隊最令我人佩服者，即能全部循規蹈矩中進展，無婉爲一良好隊伍也。</p>
<p>胖隊　此次得小胖子之嚴又陸之助陣，董仰峯之能暫時居滬，益以宋啓後陸漢俊孫鈴新凌鵬胡有成等陣容乃楚楚可觀。且胖將自有胖將之特點，重量逾人，不易所八所撞，與之爭奪，則頗易犯規。故該隊確爲一特殊之隊伍，另有一種特點，以使球迷興奮。</p>
<p>汕隊乙　小將輩圍有侵搆能榮獲申報盃乙組總冠軍，於此可見。此番並得甲組名手林志仁參加比賽，更覺如虎添翼，添一中心人物。唯究以尙待切磋，或難　有最理想之戰續，但可望在中中地位</p>
<p>青恊　皆屬年輕力壯之將，於戰攏方面，能適合當時情形，操用五人聯防或人釘人，隨機應變，最爲可取。故該隊極有前程，劉祖西何立德有大將之風度。</p>
<p>鷺聲　全隊身材高大，是其準條件之一，隊員練奮殊殷，故射籃奇準確。惜乎經騐尙差，觀其實力，非可輕視。但交綏之下，該隊時有以外失常，假以時日，大有希望。</p>
<p>強華　爲百樂門二等將士之　變而成，論之俱曾喧於一時之名將，如錢敬鏞　利康　森康陸火振王文極等，當年威風，猶能憶及。究以年事已老，難與少年爭雄，殿軍之座，恐將爲該隊所攫得矣</p>
<h3>健身訓練簡易法（二四）</h3>
<p>— 湯姆著一德譯</p>
<p>此項運動，可以一望而知其與乘坐木馬無異。身體之上部，以體爲樞軸，而向前向後運動，兩腿亦輪流，向前向後伸縮。</p>
<p>手叉腰際，右腿向前伸，身體向後擺。右腿復回原位時，左腿立即向後伸，同時身體向前擺。左右足輪流觸地，（祇有趾根着地）最好能接觸其同一地點，或相近之處。</p>
<p>木馬運動　手　腰際：預備：乘馬：休息：（三次）。</p>
<p>注意　連續運動數秒鐘。個人練習，繼續至呼吸深而且艱爲止。</p>
<p>卅九爬梯運動</p>
<p>所以謂之爬梯運動者，因多數人於登梯之時，實在是爬梯，而以婦女爲尤甚。</p>
<p>各種運動之中，其最能健身體，壯心神者，殆無過於上下樓梯，惟室中之空氣，必須淸潔。</p>
<p>此項運動之利益有三：（一）强壯腿肌，（二）增加肺量，（三）節制呼吸。</p>
<p>小學敎員若知此項運動之益，當不復畏登樓之勞，而反視爲幸福，且將提前到校，上下數次，以作練習。及至一日之功課既畢，如覺身心疲勞，當於回家之前，再行升降若干次，以資休息。實則每日上下午，如能　以十分鐘訓練學生作爬梯運動，則決不至於感覺疲勞。</p>
<p>惟練習此項運動，應注意下列三特點：</p>
<p>第一，上下樓梯時，僅以趾根踏着梯級。如全足着地，足跟重擊，則將震動腦部，直接遠反生理原則。</p>
<p>第二，身體向前傾，但不可彎腰曲背。胸部挺起，以免妨碍呼吸。</p>
<p>第三，口宜緊閉。（此事極難，如兩三人同行，尤難閉口不語。）每一吸氣皆爲隔呼吸，而非鎖骨呼吸。</p>
<p>登梯時不可談話，將至梯頂時，尤宜默不作聲。勿將餘　之呼吸氣盡行呼出。在呼吸平復如常之前，無論如何，不可將口張開。若呼吸充足，深長，而艱難，尤宜將口緊閉；直至心肺恢復常狀，方可啓口。此最筆一點，若能遵守，可以增加肺量，在發音方面，亦可受益不少。</p>
<p>下梯之時，身體宜直，祇使膝關節　屈，又祇可以趾跟踏着梯級，走下之時，緩步無聲，姿勢溫雅；准步步須堅隱。</p>
<p>四十按時練習</p>
<p>健身之道，已略盡於此，惟在本書結束之前，尙有一言。學者於上述各項運動，如欲得最大之收穕，必須每日按時練習，視若宗敎上之義務，其虔敬守時，無異熱心宗敎者之於祈禱。</p>
<p>每日晨起，必作五十次之俯仰運動，終身不輟。上午運動關節，而於晚間臨睡之前，運動肌肉。母經長時間運用心力之後，常作特殊運動，如足跟提起，足趾着地等。</p>
<p>在早餐與午餐之間，作各種努力運動，就身體方面言，最爲相宜。</p>
<p>早晚運動之後，如身體健壯，反應佳良，可以冷水擦身，否則用微溫水，以免寒冷。</p>
<p>浴時切勿受寒。以食鹽少許，放在一碗水內，以之擦身，能壯健精神，而預防受寒，或爲寒氣所襲。</p>
<p>最後尙有一點，如欲使此身體，爲靈魂適宜之居宅，必須小心注意下列三事：即所食，所飲，與所思。此三者與人體之健康，至有關係，不能稍或忽略也。（全文完）</p>
<h3>女籃球中二顆新慧星</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>年來滬上女子籃排球運動，風起雲湧，生氣蓬勃。如聯誼益康等新興勁旅，可謂極一時之盛，洵爲體壇之良好現象。惟吾人所引爲遺憾者，後起之秀，並不見多，目下縱橫巾幗，享譽最隆者，莫如綠隊。惜麾下戰士仍屬一般宿將，若黃明媛容淑儉劉珍寳王維珍輩，均係早著聲名。最近自黃杏芬張嘉箴史瑞娟等相繼出閣，脫離球壇生涯後，益令吾人感有發掘新星之必要。本季公開籃球賽中，記者最近發現二顆新彗星，一爲華僑隊之謝麗健，一即三省隊之樂嘉賽是也，茲略述兩新彗星之優點，以示鼓勵後起也。</p>
<p>謝麗健</p>
<p>謝小姐爲華僑隊之隊長，姿容秀麗，體格健美，不虧「麗健」二字。人如其名，打球動作淸脆，機警鎭靜，饒有大將風範，其在人叢中一記隻手探籃，挺身而射，角度又準，誠屬不可多得，令人擊節。論技藝，即與綠隊諸將較，亦未邊讓，假以時日，造詣正無限量，希謝小姐好自爲之，有厚望焉。</p>
<p>樂嘉寶</p>
<p>樂小姐爲足球名裁判樂秀榮君之掌珠，將門之女，家學淵源，身材適中，活發玲琍，現隸三省隊中爲正式前鋒，傳遞敏捷，基本動作，極爲可取，射籃極準，球入其手，敵衛無法刦奪，尤爲可取之虎。聞樂小姐練習籃球，爲日無多，本季加八三省，竟即嶄露頭角，殊非易易。若非富有天才，勤於苦練，易克臻此，而乃父敎導有方，要亦不可沒也。</p>

<h3>Diet Unanimously Passes Temporary Military Expenses Supplementary Budget Proposal; Both Houses of Parliament Held Plenary Sessions Yesterday</h3>

Mr. Imai expressed dissatisfaction and stated that there was no need for protests, and that the enemy should be dealt with with strength. If the enemy continues its illegal acts, it is necessary to severely punish all prisoners of war by burning them.</p>
<h3>Four Problems in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Liu Yusheng</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai's politics have appeared clearer due to personnel changes and the generally increased expectations of the people. But in reality, Shanghai is still Shanghai. The many difficult problems that Shanghai politics needs to address and resolve are the same as in the past. Aside from superficial reforms, it is not easy to present a fresh image, and thorough improvements are even more difficult to achieve. However, the unnecessary suffering endured by the people today has penetrated and touched the hearts of everyone, and is becoming increasingly difficult. The people's demand for light is not only a case of "crying out for food," but almost a state of utter restlessness. Therefore, promoting municipal affairs in Shanghai at this time is like "sending charcoal in the snow." It can not only gain widespread sympathy and support, but if this is not done, the result will inevitably be a state of great suffering, collapse and chaos beyond repair! A careful analysis of the major issues facing Shanghai today can be roughly divided into four categories: time, place, people, and affairs.</p>
<p>The first item is the "time" problem. Nowadays, many people shake their heads and sigh when talking about life, feeling that each day is worse than the last. If they want to find a solution, they can only dream of a total solution in the future. But we believe that no one can predict what the so-called total solution will be. The current suffering of the people definitely needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Whether this total solution is driven by a comprehensive plan, or by partial reforms by the authorities responsible, whoever can give the people this is a fair record of the merits and demerits of the current administrative officials and public officials to the nation and the people. From the perspective of the average person, the timing of political techniques, the complexity, and the breadth of vision and ambition are all things they understand and trust. But whoever can best protect the dignity of their country, without sacrificing effort and fatigue, to alleviate the suffering of the people and seek their welfare with the spirit of "treating the hunger and drowning of others as their own" is especially the refuge they admire and rely on. Because the times are difficult and the world is dangerous, everything hinges on the progress of the political situation, so people's expectations of politics are even more urgent and earnest. Because time is pressing and there is no room for delay, only when the municipal authorities and their cadres are willing to embrace great determination to act quickly and efficiently can they most easily gain widespread sympathy.</p>
<p>The second is the problem of "place" and the problem of "affairs." The current Shanghai Special Municipality has a vast territory, including the city and suburban areas, as well as the seven counties of Nanhui, Fengxian, Baoshan, Jiading, Chongming, Chuansha, and Shenjiang. The problems we usually focus on, such as illegal extortion by the police, corruption in tax collection, traffic congestion, scarce and delayed distribution of supplies, soaring prices, and hoarding, are all issues related to the welfare of every citizen. For example, if rations can be distributed on time and the quantity can be increased; if prices can be reasonably increased and the value of currency stabilized; if black market train tickets can be eliminated and military vehicle training can be thoroughly rectified; if finances can increase tax revenue; if police can be prevented from extorting: each item being realized can directly benefit the livelihood needs of the people, and indirectly increase the government's prestige and strengthen wartime production capacity. However, this is only one aspect of symptomatic treatment. To talk about fundamental treatment, we must consider the suffering of the people on the outskirts of Shanghai, that is, in the counties and suburban areas. The suburban areas are close to the city and easier to assist, while the county areas are vast, with intersecting seaports. In addition to the location of government offices (such as county governments, district offices, and township offices), there are often two forms of government, guerrilla groups, and the need to pay taxes and grain. In fact, some areas are not within the jurisdiction of the county government. Local bullies are not worth mentioning, and the tax collectors, district chiefs, and township heads of each county often have the qualifications of "knowing everyone." However, when it comes to the political awareness, treatment, equipment, and the stability of the lives of public officials, educators, and the care of the dead, our situation in the past has really been far behind. Therefore, the so-called three major policies of the government, namely ensuring security and rectifying ideology, are fundamentally difficult to implement. As for increasing production, due to various reasons, the countryside is almost bankrupt, and instances of corruption, extortion, and seizure are often heard. I don’t know how much has been achieved. This is the problem of "place," which is the biggest hidden concern in today's municipal affairs.</p>
<p>Humans are political animals, and politics is the business of all people. Therefore, to seek reform, the main crux lies in the problem of "people." How to understand the government's national policy and the center of the current situation, and everyone strives to sacrifice the individual to exchange for the freedom and independence of the nation, is to temper people's minds. How to improve the treatment of military police, public officials, and educators, increase the number of household rations, strengthen production mechanisms, and adjust electricity is to stabilize people's lives. How to eradicate local bullies, eliminate corruption, and boldly break open a new path of honest politics, cultivating an atmosphere of integrity, is to establish people's character. The correlation between the four problems of time, affairs, people, and place is what we hope to use Shanghai to set an example for the compatriots of the whole country, so that the realization of full peace is not impossible.</p>
<p>Weekly Review</p>
<h3>Several Preconditions for Population Evacuation</h3>
<p>— Xu Weizhou</p>
<p>In the past, after air raids, the anti-aircraft authorities talked about evacuating the population as a necessary measure for air defense. After rice prices soared, the municipal authorities also politely advised citizens to evacuate the population. Recently, the newspapers have been unanimous in advocating the evacuation of the population. With Shanghai citizens today facing the threat of air raids and livelihoods, even if the government does not implement mandatory evacuation, the number of people who do not need to stay in Shanghai and feel the threat to their livelihoods will inevitably be quite large if they want to return to their hometowns voluntarily. However, due to the trouble of moving the Baojia, inconvenient transportation, difficulties in inspections along the way, and the arbitrary levies in the inland areas, all make those who want to evacuate voluntarily regard it as a daunting task, holding on to the mentality that it is better to remain still than to move. As for the threat of air raids, on the one hand, there is still a lack of accurate imagination of the tragic situation of real air raids, so foreigners often secretly laugh at the fact that pedestrians on the road do not decrease during air raids. On the other hand, resigning oneself to fate, life and death are a great number, is the key to dealing with chaotic times inherited by ancestors for thousands of years. Those who advise danger will be regarded as greedy for life and afraid of death, or even as mentally ill. Some even rebut with the fact that Shanghai has a population of more than five million, and there are many people of value. Some even compare it to winning the lottery jackpot. Therefore, the threat of air raids does not have a very panicky effect on the psychology of citizens. However, the soaring prices of rice and daily necessities, this is a burning issue, which is enough to make those who have a little foresight quickly seek a better plan to move. Therefore, if the authorities can make some efforts on the following issues, then with a wave of their hand, they can encourage citizens who do not need to reside in Shanghai and feel the threat to their livelihoods to evacuate voluntarily to various places. This will be beneficial to the convenience of air defense and the easing of price increases. Because Shanghai is the economic center of the country, the rise and fall of prices in Shanghai are enough to stimulate prices throughout the country. Regarding what I believe are several preconditions for population evacuation, I will describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Baojia Movement For applications to obtain a return-to-hometown certificate or movement certificate, each place must be stamped, from the head of the household to the head of the Jia, the head of the Bao, and the police station. This should be handled as soon as possible. If there is any delay or extortion, once verified, they should be severely punished. Each Baojia section in each district should set up a movement inquiry office. If there are illiterate people or those who do not know the procedures, they should be told truthfully by those inquiring about applying for return to their hometown or movement affairs. Or fill out various application forms on their behalf, and order train or ship tickets on their behalf. The office staff should not be bothered and deal with them with a kind attitude.</p>
<p>(2) Land and Water Transportation The evacuation routes will be started on a trial basis using the land routes of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and the water routes of the inland rivers and China Airlines. This is because the living expenses in the villages along the above routes are indeed lower than those in Shanghai. As for the evacuation methods, for example, the Beijing-Shanghai line designates a slow train at a certain time every morning as a special train for evacuating the population. The tickets are sold by the police station and Baojia office, numbered and sold, and assigned seats. For transport ships, several shifts are designated in each month, and the ticket sales method is the same as for trains. Each evacuee returning to their hometown is subject to regulations regarding the luggage they carry and the additional fees charged, and no extra demands are allowed. If the Baojia office staff who sell train and ship tickets are found to be engaged in favoritism or bribery, or do not follow the order of priority, they should be severely punished once verified.</p>
<p>(3) Police and Military Inspection For special trains or special ships for evacuating the population, the police and military inspections should be avoided if possible, otherwise they should be implemented in a very rapid manner. For example, inland transport ships must require passengers to disembark and line up for inspection at the two ports of Beizhuang and Ji Wang Temple, regardless of wind or rain, which urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>(4) Arrangement in the Interior The customs in the interior are different, and there are some discriminatory opinions towards visitors from other places. For example, renting a house requires a very high tip if proper arrangements are not made in advance. Even if the procedures for changing to a residence permit are extremely complete, there are still many inconveniences. Local authorities should be asked to set up reception centers in various places and make proper arrangements in advance to reduce the suffering of the evacuated population.</p>
<h3>Authorities Plan to Stabilize the Lives of Military and Police in the Capital; Extreme Punishment Will Be Imposed on Those Who Hinder Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - It is inevitable that there will be a lack of materials in wartime, and it is also an inevitable trend that prices will rise and living expenses will increase. Recently, the central authorities have established the "Capital Materials Fair Price Maintenance Committee." The main purpose is to restore the normal and stable supply of essential materials for life in the capital, and to universally improve the treatment of the military, police, and security forces to stabilize their lives and allow them to serve with peace of mind, so as to thoroughly assist the authorities in maintaining price control. It is reported that specific measures have been formulated, including investigating recent prices, calculating the minimum monthly living expenses for each person, and issuing subsidies in addition to their original monthly salaries. In addition, those with families in the capital will also be given subsidies to support their direct relatives. In addition, there will be the issuance of rice and firewood. It is expected that the lives of the general military, police, and security forces will become stable after receiving this subsidy, which will be of great benefit to maintaining discipline and cooperating in price control in the future.</p>
<p>Organization of the Maintenance Committee Determined</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the establishment of the Capital Materials Fair Price Maintenance Committee, the organization of its internal temporary institutions has been largely determined. Under the committee, there will be a secretariat, and four groups will be established: "point release," "fuel," "supervision," and "military law," each responsible for its specific duties. Among them, the supervision group will carry out strict supervisory activities in designated areas for the seven essential living materials and related areas. The military law group is the adjudication body, and can apply the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and the Special Criminal Law in Wartime, various regulations on punishing corruption by public officials, and the Criminal Law. For the seven essential living materials, anyone who uses violence, coercion, fraud, or other illegal actions to hinder their supply and demand relationship, thereby affecting the city and causing adverse phenomena, will be dealt with by military order in wartime with the death penalty. If anyone illegally extorts donations or uses their power to extort people's property by violence, coercion, fraud, or other illegal crimes in order to obtain illegal profits, whether they are unscrupulous merchants or public officials, they will be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Efforts to Smooth the Source of Pigs</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - After the authorities formulated a fair price maintenance plan for the seven items of rice, firewood, oil, vegetables, and pork, there were also regulations for pork. The reason for the high price of green pork is that, in addition to the fact that it cannot be transported to Beijing due to transportation relations along the Jinpu line, the important factor is that the operation of the publicly operated community for pigs is imperfect. The authorities have now ordered the public community to temporarily suspend its activities for one month and temporarily allow pigs to be freely bought and sold, and the municipal government will give reasonable valuations. The authorities plan to try it for one month, observe its effectiveness, and then decide on measures. It is expected that the source of pigs in the capital will be unblocked as a result, and prices will also tend to fall as a result.</p>

<h3>Diligent Work, Correcting Conduct and Thought: Mayor Zhou Instructs Secretariat Staff</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou convened a meeting with senior staff of the Municipal Secretariat at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 27th) in the City Hall's VIP room. Those present included Shen Guanzhun, Councilor and Director of the General Accounting Office; Councilors Pan Da, Ling Xianwen, and Wang Deyi; Secretaries Ge Yujiu (also head of the First Group), Yang Shi (also head of the Second Group), Liang Senzhang (also head of the Third Group), and Ling Dating (also head of the Fourth Group); Secretaries Tang Yuhao and Liu Langji; Cao Jingang, Chief of the General Affairs Section; and Sun Guangdi, Specialist and Director of the Printing Office, totaling over forty people. After briefly inquiring about each person's background, Mayor Zhou gave the following instructions:</p>
<p>"I have been appointed as the Mayor of Shanghai with the determination to rejuvenate the Shanghai Municipal Administration. This requires each responsible bureau and department to carry out their respective tasks. However, the Municipal Secretariat is like the main driving force of a factory. If the driving force itself is not sound, it will undoubtedly be impossible to promote the various parts of the machine to operate actively. The Municipal Secretariat is the foundation of all bureaus and departments, and must generate a great driving force to propel the subordinate agencies.</p>
<p>Two Hopes</p>
<p>The personnel situation of the Municipal Secretariat is very complex, involving the merger of personnel from the old Municipal Government and the former First and Eighth Districts. The will and thoughts of each person are not unified, and emotions are not entirely harmonious. Among the personnel, there are bound to be those who are good and those who are not. In the past, there have been many criticisms of this office from the outside. From now on, regardless of each person's past history, their thoughts and will must be unified. No matter which agency each person came from in the past, they must not harbor any more factionalism. Since Secretary-General Luo took office, everyone must strive to invigorate themselves, unify their thoughts and will, harmonize everyone's emotions, and eliminate all past prejudices. This is my first hope for you all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I hope that this office will stand in a position of proactive attitude, to promote municipal administration, and cooperate with municipal administration, so that municipal administration can be smoothly promoted, and various agencies can accept the guidance of this office. You must understand that this office is the staff of the highest guiding agency in the city, that is, the General Staff Headquarters. If you do not actively use your minds to think of solutions, and hope to direct subordinate agencies to reform the municipal administration, it is absolutely impossible. Therefore, you must stand in the capacity of staff members of the highest guiding agency, to actively promote the work, and absolutely must not adopt a passive attitude to deal with everything.</p>
<p>In the past, there have been various undesirable phenomena in this office. For example, the processing of official documents was often delayed for a long time. From now on, whether it is an order from the central government or an official document from a subordinate agency, it must be processed quickly. The above orders must be prompt, and the official documents of lower agencies must be even more prompt. You must do your utmost to speed up the review or communication. Whether the processing of official documents is prompt or not is like the speed of blood circulation in a person's body. If the blood vessels in a person's body circulate quickly, his body will be very strong. Conversely, if an agency cannot transmit official documents, this agency, although it exists, is equivalent to being dead. I hope that from now on, everyone will not delay unnecessarily when processing official documents.</p>
<p>Reforming Bad Habits</p>
<p>In the past, subordinate agencies of this government often had to negotiate conditions when applying for funds from this office. This is the responsibility of the General Accounting Office. Not only was it necessary to negotiate conditions for requesting temporary funds, but it was also necessary to negotiate good conditions and give a discount when receiving regular funds. This is the most hateful thing. From now on, this is absolutely not allowed to happen again, otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed according to the law. There will be no leniency. Furthermore, in the past, there were cases of falsely reporting accounts when buying things. For example, if you bought something for one hundred yuan, eighty yuan of it was a fake account, which was taken and divided up by everyone, while the public received only twenty yuan worth of goods. This is simply too outrageous. From now on, such shameful phenomena are absolutely not allowed to happen again. If this happens again, once verified, it will be immediately sent to the court for strict handling, and there will be no tolerance. In addition, once this kind of atmosphere becomes habitual and continues, the people in this office and the entire municipal government will be looked down upon by the people, and the entire municipal government will also be looked down upon by the people. At that time, I will have no face to be the mayor. Regarding this point, those responsible for purchasing and other personnel must be especially cautious and careful. If such adverse events occur again, they must be strictly sanctioned by law.</p>
<p>Striving for Self-Discipline</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that everyone will act in accordance with their own conscience, stand in the position of staff members of the highest municipal guidance agency, on the one hand work hard, and on the other hand correct their conduct and thought, so that the Shanghai Municipal Administration will usher in a new era, make contributions to the society, and create a stable social status for themselves, and receive glorious criticism from all sides. I hope that everyone will earnestly follow the ancient teachings of "correcting mistakes when they exist, and encouraging when they do not," so that they can live up to themselves and the government, and have something to answer to the country and society. Otherwise, if you continue to muddle along like this, there will be no benefit. It is better to automatically strive for self-discipline and do a glorious career to live up to the nation."</p>
<h3>Kyoto Imperial University Alumni Association Welcomes Mayor Zhou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Alumni Association of Kyoto Imperial University of Japan, in view of alumnus Mayor Zhou's new leadership of Shanghai's administration, held a welcome tea party at the Capital Hotel yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM to express their welcome. More than one hundred Chinese and Japanese alumni, including Masutaro Kimura, attended. After Mayor Zhou arrived on time, Mr. Kimura, as the representative of the Alumni Association, delivered a welcoming speech, stating that Mayor Zhou is a modern Chinese politician. China's future depends on the practical abilities and firm beliefs of great politicians. We, as alumni, are very pleased to welcome Mayor Zhou's leadership of Shanghai's administration. Subsequently, Mayor Zhou delivered a speech, briefly describing his student life in Kagoshima and Kyoto, and recounting his experience in organizing the Communist Party, participating in the revolution, and the various changes in his thinking. Finally, regarding his leadership of Shanghai's administration, he stated: "My most prominent characteristic is that I can say what I can do, and I can do what I say. This is my determination. When preparing to organize the Central Reserve Bank, the situation was extremely difficult, and many people opposed it. However, I believed that a central bank must be organized, so I disregarded all difficulties and eliminated all opposing arguments, and succeeded. This is my personal determination. The situation in Shanghai is even more difficult, but after dozens of days of consideration, I am determined to improve the Shanghai administration. Once I have made a decision, no matter what difficulties or opposition there may be, I will work hard to implement it according to the planned plan. Now, I am like an athlete in a competition, and everyone is like a cheering team on the sidelines. If you want to win the competition, your cheering team must do their best to support. There are many thorns ahead, and I hope that everyone will give me advice and assistance as fellow alumni." After Mr. Zhou finished his speech, Mr. Yasui delivered a speech. The meeting was adjourned after a group photo was taken at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Attacking Shanghai: Public Exhibition Opens Today at the Racecourse Airfield</h3>
<p>The enemy aircraft that attacked the outskirts of Shanghai on the 20th of this month had seven shot down by Allied air defense forces, including a P-51 type, which crashed in Qingpu County. The Allied Land and Naval Press Department and the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city, in order to arouse the people's air defense awareness and anti-enemy sentiment due to the enemy's repeated attacks on Shanghai with US aircraft and the indiscriminate bombing that caused many innocent people to be killed and injured, transported the shot-down enemy aircraft to Shanghai yesterday. It is scheduled to be exhibited at the Racecourse Airfield from the 29th to February 2nd.</p>
<h3>Director Liu Discusses Propaganda and Governance: First Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office, after the new Director Liu Dexuan took office, was held for the first time at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 27th) in the City Hall conference room. More than ten newspaper reporters from various newspapers in the city attended. Director Liu gave a speech on the future work plan of the Propaganda Office and the general implementation, as follows:</p>
<p>The Propaganda Office is an official guiding propaganda agency. I have been a reporter for many years. Now that I have been ordered to lead the Propaganda Office, I sincerely hope that everyone will cooperate. The Propaganda Office mainly handles the review and registration of propaganda-related matters. In the past, there were numerous abuses in handling the review and registration procedures, which need not be detailed here. From now on, we will adhere to the intentions and determination of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, strive to correct them, and absolutely eliminate the matter of extra extortion.</p>
<p>Regarding the registration of general publications, we have decided to conduct strict reviews, follow the orders of the Propaganda Department and the Municipal Government, and will not be partial to any party. We also plan to have small newspapers publish current affairs and war news to assist in wartime propaganda.</p>
<p>Regarding the priority rationing of news reporters, I am very concerned about this. Director Liu of the Materials Allocation Office has just taken office, and he is actively organizing the priority allocation for reporters. However, general news practitioners, such as managers, are also assisting in news, and should be given the same allocation. I sincerely hope that the Shanghai Branch of the Journalists Association will strengthen its work. The priority allocation matters can be reviewed by the Shanghai Branch of the Journalists Association, and then handed over to the Propaganda Office for execution and negotiation. The paper problem for newspapers is becoming increasingly serious, and we are actively reviewing it to find a solution.</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>After the speech, the reporters from various newspapers jointly brought up the matter of the Civil Defense Office's unreasonable refusal to allow newspaper reporters to enter the tea party to welcome Mayor Zhou and other newly appointed municipal officials on the afternoon of the 25th of this month, and questioned Director Liu and demanded a guarantee of freedom of news coverage. Director Liu inquired in detail and reviewed the matter for a long time.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhou Instructs Judicial Officials to Strictly Handle Corruption Cases and Strengthen Cooperation Between Judiciary and Administration</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Mayor Zhou Fohai has been determined to rectify discipline and eliminate corruption. However, if the judicial organs cannot cooperate with the policies of the administrative organs, the effect of rectification will not be easily achieved. Yesterday, he specially invited Prosecutor Zhao of the District Prosecutor's Office and President Feng of the District Court for a discussion. In his capacity as Deputy Executive Yuan, he earnestly instructed that cases of malfeasance and corruption sent by the Municipal Government must not be released on bail at will, must not be delayed, and must not be lenient. He urged that prosecution and trials be conducted with extremely expedient and strict methods. It is expected that cooperation between the judiciary and administration will be further strengthened in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the New Association Feasts Director Liu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Journalists Association hosted a luncheon yesterday (the 27th) for Liu Dexuan, the new Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, and invited senior officials of the Propaganda Office to accompany them. Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Association, and all the directors and general managers attended. Chairman Chen first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by Director Liu, who gave detailed explanations on priority rationing for news practitioners, the paper problem for newspapers, and how to strengthen the New Association.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhao Xuan Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business</h3>
<p>Zhao Zunyue, the newly appointed Minister of Propaganda of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on official business a few days ago. It is reported that he will formally meet with all sectors of the city in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Urges Collection of Overdue Licenses</h3>
<p>Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau, in view of the large number of pending cases of approved registration licenses for various companies, factories, and businesses that have applied for registration in the past, which has actually hindered the right to legitimate business operations, will immediately notify all businesses and factories. If they are indeed operating legitimately and have completed the legal procedures for registration and have been approved for registration, but have not yet collected their business registration licenses, they should quickly bring their receipts to the bureau within the specified time limit to collect them.</p>
<h3>Reader's Aid to Education News</h3>
<p>Xie Xiaochu Donates Chemistry Scholarship</p>
<p>Xie Xiaochu of China Chemical Industry Company wrote in a letter: "Recently, Xiaochu has suffered a recurrence of stomach disease and has received condolences from friends and relatives. I have no way to repay their kindness, so I have specially donated funds for good deeds, to bless all my friends and relatives, and to respond to your newspaper's advocacy of social education. In addition to donating 100,000 yuan myself, I will also provide tuition fees for six chemistry students in the university department from this semester, named 'Xiaochu Chemistry University Scholarship', to be provided until graduation. If they drop out halfway, excellent students will be selected to fill the vacancies at any time. Please ask your newspaper and the News Daily to handle three students each. If my ability allows, I will increase the number of students at any time. In addition, I have raised a total of 300,000 yuan in goods and cash. Together with my own donation of 100,000 yuan, the total is 400,000 yuan. I will now donate the raised 200,000 yuan in goods, which are the old brand Wei Ying Wei Feng seasoning powder produced by the Second Factory of the China Chemical Industry Company, Zhongnan Wei Ying Factory, according to the price limit of 200,000 yuan. These will be donated to the market for auction to rescue out-of-school students. The remaining 200,000 yuan will be donated to Puyutang. I hope you will send staff to give instructions on the procedures so that I can comply."</p>
<p>You Huaigao Promotes Aid to Education</p>
<p>You Huaigao of China Milk Powder Factory said twice: "Respected Sir, I have always admired your newspaper's role in leading public opinion and developing culture. The provision of scholarships in recent years has enabled poor students to avoid dropping out of school, benefiting the people. I am willing to do my best for the cause of education, so I have taken the initiative to consult with relevant organizations. Together with my own donation, I have raised five teams, totaling 100,000 yuan in foreign currency. I am sending a check and a list for your review."</p>
<p>Saving Congratulatory Gifts to Be Used for Aid to Education</p>
<p>Nian Zi wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, your newspaper's advocacy of aid to education has become a social trend, and its contribution to society is admirable! My wife gave birth to a son last month. My colleagues heard about it and wanted to congratulate me. I believe that this would be a waste of money and of no benefit. Therefore, I have a way to be economical: the rescue of out-of-school children is very urgent today! Everyone is enthusiastic. If you must congratulate me, you can convert it into cash to save out-of-school children, which is more meaningful. Everyone agreed. Therefore, in the name of saving banquet fees, a total of 63,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was collected, and I donated an additional 2,000 yuan, totaling 65,000 yuan. I am enclosing a check with this letter, and I hope you will collect it to show sincerity and to promote this idea."</p>

<h3>Leyte Island Front: Human Bombs Conquer Machines – A Record of Conversations with Lieutenant Tetsuyuki Kawanishi</h3>
<p>The front lines on Leyte Island are now completely intertwined. The US military, attempting to secure the sea lanes, advanced their amphibious assault warfare along the west coast and attempted to penetrate Ormoc, but the landed US troops were unable to connect with each other due to fierce Japanese attacks, and were isolated into several sections. Therefore, on the western battlefield of Leyte, the two armies were interwoven and engaged in continuous chaotic battles. Below is a record of conversations with Lieutenant Tetsuyuki Kawanishi, who recently returned to base from the fierce Leyte front. Although the language is simple, it provides a glimpse into the decisive battle between the Japanese and US forces on Leyte Island.</p>
<p>Advancing Rapidly with Light Equipment</p>
<p>After landing in Ormoc, I followed the unit northward towards Carigara. This landing operation was very smooth. We advanced from the sea, about one kilometer from the shore, using amphibious assault craft to unload weapons and ammunition, while the soldiers waded through the water, which reached chest level. The landing operation took two nights, during which we were attacked once by 20 "Unified" type aircraft, but the damage was minimal. The vanguard unit advanced towards Cari on the same night, and we also marched day and night. Ormoc, with its alternating red and white roofs, soon fell behind us. We advanced on the wide, flat asphalt road. Green coconut groves frequently appeared along the roadside, spread out under the scorching sun. Our troops were pulling artillery pieces by hand along this motor road. Seeing the soldiers covered in sweat, I wished we had tractors or horses to replace them, but in reality, in order to carry as many cannons as possible, we had almost no horses or tractors. Moreover, food and supplies were extremely scarce, so on the fourth day after landing, we had to eat dry bread, drink coconut juice, and use taro and corn to fill our stomachs.</p>
<p>Enemy Discovered</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, we were attacked by twelve or thirteen P28 type aircraft. They flew very low, circling and strafing with machine guns, and we immediately returned fire. At this time, the vanguard had reached the summit of Mount Limon, overlooking the sea off San Miguel Bay, and discovered countless enemy landing craft gathering in front of Caraga. Coinciding with the landing of our elite troops, the enemy was also landing more than a division of troops in front of us. Near the summit of Mount Limon, we were being heavily shelled by enemy mortars, and our battle began. The enemy's operation relied on material quantities and machinery. In the battle on Leyte Island, they used mortars and radio wave weapons as much as possible. The mortars had a considerable caliber, and their shells, when they landed, could create holes two or three meters in diameter. Moreover, these heavy mortars were operated and aimed by various radio wave weapons. As long as there was the sound of leather shoes dragging or iron rubbing against iron, the enemy's artillery would open fire. In addition, the enemy also had a peculiar observation aircraft, which the soldiers nicknamed "Dragonfly". From about 7:00 AM, it would circle above us. It was a monoplane carrying two or three people, equipped with a large radio antenna, and flew very slowly, with a speed of less than one hundred kilometers per hour. When it soared overhead, if smoke rose, enemy heavy mortars would soon fire upon us. This type of "Dragonfly" was mainly in wireless communication with artillery units on all sides. Once, I and two soldiers, a total of three people, went to conduct reconnaissance of the position, and were accidentally discovered by the "Dragonfly". Immediately, enemy mortar shells rained down, but they were not accurate. Also, the radio waves of the radio signal squad would cause a barrage of gunfire to fall nearby. However, although the shells hit extremely close, casualties were surprisingly few, indicating that the effectiveness was not great.</p>
<p>Suicide Charge</p>
<p>Another point is that the enemy fully used long-range artillery. They fired from heavy artillery positions near Palo towards the streets of Ormoc, throwing a large number of shells. By mid-November, the streets of Ormoc had become ruins, and a portion of the pier in the harbor had also been destroyed by artillery fire. We responded to this challenge from the enemy with suicide squads, shaking the enemy's formation and directly attacking their nests. The vanguard members wore soft-soled shoes, carried Japanese swords, held specially made spears, and carried several hand grenades, infiltrating the enemy's artillery positions in the dark. The enemy had deployed countless listening devices in the dense forest, and the surrounding machine guns were set up with strict vigilance, but our suicide squads were able to skillfully use hand grenades to destroy their machine gun nests. Our suicide squads charged into enemy positions almost every night. As soon as the enemy soldiers knew that suicide squads had entered their positions, they scattered in panic, covering their heads and fleeing, allowing our suicide squads to leisurely destroy their positions. The defenses built by the enemy relying on material and machinery became useless waste once they were broken.</p>
<p>Our suicide squads had almost no casualties, which is truly commendable. It was almost as successful as a regular exercise. Only when comrades occasionally died in battle did we realize that this was a real war. Soldiers departing for suicide charges often said, "There is nothing more satisfying than killing the enemy in the vanguard!" This soaring spirit deeply penetrated the hearts of those of us living in the dense forest. In the battle between human bombs and iron weapons, the victory of human bombs relied on the overwhelming courage.</p>
<p>There is no terrible malaria on Leyte Island, and the water is relatively clean. Living in the roadless jungle does not cause much inconvenience or hardship for our well-trained warriors. As for food, coconuts, corn, and taro are abundant and can be found everywhere. (Special Correspondent's Report, Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, December 26)</p>
<p>European Eastern Front Situation Map</p>
<p>On the Eastern Front, the fighting is most intense in Upper Silesia, southeast of Oels (Oleśnica). The Soviet side has concentrated large forces to attack, and the German army is also continuously sending reinforcements to the front. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in Königsberg, Elbing, Danzig, Schneidemühl, Thorn, Bromberg, Posen, Breslau, and other places.</p>

<h3>Lion Rock</h3>
<p>— Yema</p>
<p>"Look, that prominent hilltop is Lion Rock."</p>
<p>Travelers passing along the official road can all see Lion Rock. It is a hilltop that protrudes from a range of mountains running parallel to the official road. The summit is high and precipitous, and at the top of the mountain there is a large rock, devoid of vegetation. It is unknown when someone said it resembled a lion's head, and so "Lion Rock" became its official name. The small village with only seven or eight households at the foot of the rock is also called Lion Village.</p>
<p>To ascend this hilltop, one must traverse it from the side of that mountain range. Besides lumberjacks and the monks from the ancient Lion Temple, which is named after the mountain, who occasionally go up, few villagers from Lion Village ever ascend it. Therefore, the mountain is covered in dense trees and thorns, and snakes often appear and disappear among them. Since a mottled giant snake appeared and frightened a playful young novice to death, even fewer people dared to go up the rock. The villagers warned each other, and the small path up the mountain was gradually obscured.</p>
<p>One late night, the old monk in the ancient Lion Temple had just finished his evening service and walked out of the main hall. He looked up and saw a streak of light, or perhaps mist, rising from the Lion Rock, reaching straight into the sky, all the way up to the clouds. A strange and mysterious idea arose in his mind, coinciding with the plots in the strange and supernatural novels he had read in the past. He spoke of it, and people passed on the story that a sword immortal was refining elixirs on Lion Rock. The white light seen every late night was the sword light from his elixir refining. Only those with a karmic connection could see it; ordinary mortal eyes could not. As a result, Lion Rock was shrouded in even more mystery. The giant snake that had frightened the young novice to death was regarded as the guardian of the sword immortal guarding the mountain.</p>
<p>"Look, that prominent hilltop is Lion Rock."</p>
<p>When the villagers pointed out Lion Rock to passersby on the official road, their tone was full of mysterious implications. If you asked further:</p>
<p>"What about Lion Rock?"</p>
<p>Then, they would tell you a fantastical story of a sword immortal, fabricated out of thin air.</p>
<p>It is not known in which year an elderly man from the city came to practice Buddhism, cultivate himself, and repent of his sins. He brought a large amount of earth and wood and workers, and built a small hermitage halfway up the mountain. After it was completed, a corner of red wall was added to the forest on the mountainside. Often, at dusk or dawn, the sound of morning and evening chanting bells would drift out in the mountain forest along with the misty clouds, echoing the sound of the bells from the ancient Lion Temple at the foot of the mountain. Some pilgrims from the ancient Lion Temple also conveniently climbed the mountain, and Lion Rock was thus a little less lonely.</p>
<p>Five, no, six years later, the elderly man who had quietly cultivated himself died without illness. After his death, apart from the monks from the ancient Lion Temple going up the mountain to chant sutras and pray for his salvation every seventh day, none of his family members came to take care of his affairs. The small hermitage on the mountain became the upper courtyard of the ancient Lion Temple, and some servants who cleaned and swept also lived there. One day, a daring visitor from outside, ignoring the advice of the servants, risked climbing to the top of the mountain to see what Lion Rock was all about. After he returned, he said that Lion Rock was just a larger rock. There was no vegetation or animals on it. However, no one believed his report. Whenever passersby traveled along the official road, the villagers would still point out the hilltop in a mysterious tone and say:</p>
<p>"Look, that prominent hilltop is Lion Rock."</p>
<h3>To My Younger Brother Ming</h3>
<p>— Shidi</p>
<p>We are not flowers and plants of the greenhouse,</p>
<p>Surrounded by fragile glass;</p>
<p>Uninterested in the mud and sand under the window,</p>
<p>Let the torrential rain wash you to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Cherishing ambitions of a thousand miles,</p>
<p>Alas, there is no swift steed to cover a hundred!</p>
<p>Stand tall and upright,</p>
<p>Welcoming the chilling frost flowers.</p>
<p>Almost three years have passed,</p>
<p>The turbulent life has been more than a thousand days and nights,</p>
<p>The head of a twenty-two-year-old youth is turning white!</p>
<p>Only one's own weakness is to be pitied;</p>
<p>Even if you get a steed that can run a thousand miles,</p>
<p>You will only sadly gaze at the distant clouds and smoke.</p>
<p>Compose a "Returning Home" poem,</p>
<p>Although the dilapidated homeland always adds endless warmth to the weary traveler.</p>
<p>Why are you silent again?</p>
<p>Is it that the mountains and passes are too high and difficult to cross,</p>
<p>Or are you afraid of shattering the golden dream in your heart?</p>
<h3>Past Emotions</h3>
<p>— Fang Xuan</p>
<p>I am a person who does not smoke, but occasionally I light one up, especially in the dark of night. I love the glimmer of light and the faint wisps of smoke. They allow me to think further and more ethereally, forgetting the honor and disgrace of the world.</p>
<p>Although I have only lived for twenty years, my worries are greater than those of a fifty-year-old. I matured so early, and I was sickly since childhood. When I was eight years old, I would still fall down when walking. Yet, when I was ten years old, if I even came across a girl, I already felt embarrassed to be close to her.</p>
<p>I did not have a childhood. It seems that as soon as I left my mother's embrace, I knew what "trouble" was. I remember that a poet once praised the time when a person is around twenty years old as "golden, worthy of a lifetime of treasure!" Yet at this age, I feel most lost and most tormented!</p>
<p>During the day, I indulge in my own dreams. I am such a dreamer! I weep or laugh in my dreams. At night, someone comes to adorn my dreams. I feel my heart beat and my face flush, and sometimes, when I get anxious, I cry out in a sob…</p>
<p>—I am still young, why be so impatient?</p>
<p>I buried my head in the quilt, secretly pondering.</p>
<p>But after I was bullied by a not-so-reputable girl, I could no longer calm my mind. She looked down on what I cherished. In her eyes, Tao Yuanming was just a poor old man. "A scroll of Tao's poems is not as valuable as a diamond ring!" (I remember when she said this, she was evenly applying powder to her face, turning the corners of her mouth into an arc, and rolling her eyes.) She was infatuated with a "young master" who could give her a good life. —This "young master's" father was a man of influence in Shanghai, with nearly ten thousand followers under his command. A single word from him could stir things up and make a mess!</p>
<p>(My heart trembled. I heard that after this woman gave birth to a girl, she had already attached herself to this "young master's" estate. If I had another chance to approach her, how should I treat her?…)</p>
<p>That very winter, I left my warm home and went to live in a mountain city where I had no relatives. I used the hardships of life to forget the wounds in my heart. I was not saddened by my "broken love," but what made me gnash my teeth and hate was that I thought I was accommodating her (who was she!), but she deliberately humiliated my self-esteem!</p>
<p>In these few months, I followed a "life" mentor, from whom I experienced hunger, cold, and poverty. I no longer reacted emotionally to even the smallest joys and sorrows of the world.</p>
<p>But when I returned to Shanghai, the old surroundings stirred up my resentment again. I want revenge! I want revenge, but the one I harmed was such a kind child!</p>
<p>She was always regarded as my little sister. She didn't seem to understand much about the world, and she was somewhat reserved. I remember one time she came to my classroom to find me, and after my classmates teased her, she cried with swollen eyes. At the time, I thought it was funny, little did I know that half a year later, I would be extracting her pain to soothe my wounds.</p>
<p>One day, I was chatting with her in her living room when one of her elders came, and I excused myself. The next day, she called me, hoping that I would go to her place again. As soon as I stepped into her house, she clapped her hands and stomped her feet, laughing.</p>
<p>"Someone asked me, what kind of guest are you?"</p>
<p>How could I answer? I shook my head, feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>"If you don't know, how would I know!"</p>
<p>Saying that, she laughed again.</p>
<p>Humans are emotional animals, I don't deny it. When I felt that I was also somewhat in love with her, I was startled: I can't do this, I didn't have good intentions from the start! So, I used a small, willful thing she did as an excuse and broke up with her.</p>
<p>There was an unspeakable guilt in my heart. I could no longer live quietly at home. One morning with a mix of rain and snow, I left Shanghai again. I settled down in a backward trading port. It was not far from my hometown and had my relatives and friends. They all cared about me, even an elder who liked to drink advised me to drink less and not to ruin my body too much. I'm not a big fan of gambling, but during that month, I gambled madly. I had already lost so much that my heart was beating violently, but I still trembled and threw all the money in my pocket in for a last-ditch effort!</p>
<p>Finally, I fell ill. I had a fever every day, and my skin was covered in hives. At first, I saw a Western doctor. His diagnosis was blood poisoning. But after injecting a few times the serum drawn from my own blood vessels, it still didn't have much effect, and I had to consult a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. For the sake of decocting medicine, I moved to live with a relative.</p>
<p>This relative was originally very close to me, but after the death of a female elder with a blood relationship to me, I became a very polite guest here. On the day of the lunar New Year's Eve, the eldest cousin secretly shed tears in front of her mother's portrait, not even noticing when I approached her. I softly called her name, and she looked at me silently with glistening tears on her eyelashes.</p>
<p>"What can be done? She passed away so young!"</p>
<p>Before I could finish my comforting words, she burst into tears. I was at a loss, I moved closer to her body and took both her hands. But before I could say anything more, she broke free of my hand and left me in the room!</p>
<p>—Was there anything about my actions that offended you?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask her this several times, but I never succeeded. Why should I embarrass a pure girl? My lifestyle is different from hers, and my moral standards may not be acceptable to her. So even now, she has already given birth to a child for me, and I still don't understand her feelings at the time….</p>
<h3>I Love the Guitar</h3>
<p>— Meimo Zhi</p>
<p>In the corner is my beloved quiet instrument—the guitar, I love its ardor, more than I love myself ten thousand times.</p>
<p>It always lies quietly in that dim, lonely corner, and its outline is enough to imagine the exquisite beauty of its true form.</p>
<p>That corner is always swept very clean. The place could originally accommodate a chair or a bookshelf, but now it is suitably placed with this wonderful instrument, which can accompany the calm of the owner of this house.</p>
<p>I love this guitar, because in these cold and harsh winter days, having lost warmth and sunshine, with the bad state of mind, and the knot in my heart, there needs to be a kind of childish joy to inspire my life, to sing my hopes, to entrust my infinite enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Guitar, this quiet and drawn-out melody, this full and steady rhythm, these few strings can play out the magnificent, poignant, yearning, sorrowful, ardent, love and hate, joy that I can imagine!</p>
<p>The famous tunes in the world will remain in history because of it, and the stories of joys and sorrows, partings and reunions in the world will all become the objects of its playing.</p>
<p>I love it, precisely because it is the most sacred, holy, and the most faithful recorder of history. As long as you have the ability to learn from it, it will give you supreme comfort.</p>
<p>When a person is lonely, has lost maternal love, and has shattered his dreams, he entrusts his life to it so that his life can play the musical score of youth that it should have.</p>
<p>So I deeply love it. The more severe the cold, the deeper the length, the more ruthless the sharpness, the more powerful the ice and snow, the more I cultivate ardent love for this thing that does not flatter the world. I hope that one day, I can use its strings to play out my current grief and anger, and ardent hope.</p>

<h3>A Wonderful Scene from the Third Basketball League: A Commentary on the Zhongbei Victory Over the Shantou Team, Introducing the Strengths of Each Team in Groups A and B</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Third Shanghai Basketball League last week, Group A is composed of the first-class players in Shanghai, while Groups A and B are composed of outstanding up-and-comers. The women's teams have shown great progress with both old teams and emerging powerhouses, so it's no wonder that the games are so exciting. This week, the game between Zhongbei and Shantou on Friday evening (the 26th) was the most noteworthy. It not only demonstrated the full potential of basketball skills, but also displayed sportsmanship and morality, a satisfactory gain for all, so I am pleased to comment on it.</p>
<p>As Shantou had previously defeated Zhongbei in the Shenbao Cup, Zhongbei has now taken revenge for this defeat. Regarding the situation of this battle, Shantou initially led 4-0, but soon Zhongbei surpassed them and remained in pursuit behind Shantou. Zhongbei's ability to control the situation and maintain the lead was truly remarkable. Now, let us discuss the reasons for Zhongbei's victory and the key to Shantou's defeat.</p>
<p>Proper Lineup Allocation: The Main Reason for Zhongbei's Victory</p>
<p>Zhongbei currently employs a man-to-man defense, so the measures for guarding opponents must be carefully considered. Assigning Zhuo Guorong to guard Lin Weiting, Bao Songyuan to guard Chen Qingjiang, and Li Zhenzhong to manage Ma Canxi were all well-targeted deployments. This is the primary reason for their victory. The secondary reasons were their efforts during the game and the successful display of their basketball skills. However, observing that the Zhongbei team, which is known as the master of the Northern style, has recently adopted a "gum-like" style. The agility and dazzling skills of the Northern style were only occasionally displayed. This is certainly an improvement in tactics, but those who praise it commend it as a combination of the strengths of both the North and South, while those who criticize it regret that it has hidden the characteristics of the Northern style.</p>
<p>Although Shantou Suffered Defeat, Their Performance Was Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>Shantou has always been known for its meticulous training and liveliness, and its excellent teamwork. In this game, they were able to display these two qualities to their fullest extent. Victory or defeat is another matter. All five players were full of energy. Ji Nankang, in particular, directed the center with good order and has the demeanor of a great general. Ma Canxi's interceptions under the basket, utilizing his position and timing among Zhongbei's tall players, were often surprising. Overall, although Shantou suffered defeat in this game, it was indeed a successful game for them.</p>
<p>Two More Good Games Next Wednesday and Weekend</p>
<p>Next week, there will be two more of the most exciting basketball games in the League, namely, on Wednesday (the 31st), Hualian will face the Shantou team. On the weekend (February 4th), Zhongbei and Hualian will have a major battle. These three teams are currently the three giants of Shanghai, and they will surely compete with each other in intelligence and courage, and use their strategies to win praise.</p>
<h3>Introducing the Strength of Each Team in Groups A and B</h3>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the teams in Group AA and the women's group, I described them in the previous issue. The eight teams joining Groups A and B can be considered leaders in Group B and outstanding emerging talents. Therefore, I am happy to introduce them here as well.</p>
<p>Zhongbei B: This time, in addition to the original lineup, they have recruited famous players such as Li Ruixiong and Liu Fushan from the former South China team, and Wang Jinghu, Shen Da, Shi Jiuquan, and Zheng Guoli from the Star team. Their strength has suddenly increased several times, giving the impression that the championship is surely theirs. In fact, with such a strong lineup, dominating this group seems very possible.</p>
<p>Donghua: They demonstrate the skills of famous football players in the confined space of a basketball court. Their strength is more than sufficient. Moreover, Mai Youliang, Li Yao, Zhang Banglun, and Han Longhai are all versatile players and experienced veterans. However, recently, they seem to have focused more on football, with less basketball practice. Therefore, it's difficult to discuss their tactics and cooperation, relying solely on their basic skills and considerable strength. But within this group, only Donghua is capable of threatening Zhongbei B.</p>
<p>Team V: This group of young players, under the leadership of Wu Zibin, strives to improve. Therefore, they participated in Group A during the Shenbao Cup. Although they finished last, they gained a lot of experience. Zhu Mingxing and Xia Wanyou are particularly outstanding. Therefore, within this group, there is a strong hope for a high ranking. What I admire most about this team is its ability to progress entirely according to the rules, making it a very good team.</p>
<p>Fat Team: This time, with the assistance of the "Little Fatty" Yan Youlu, and Dong Yangfeng temporarily residing in Shanghai, coupled with the lineup of Song Qihou, Lu Hanjun, Sun Lingxin, Ling Peng, and Hu Youcheng, the team is quite impressive. Furthermore, the "fat" players have their own characteristics. Their weight exceeds others, making them difficult to bump into. Competing with them easily leads to fouls. Therefore, this team is indeed a special one, possessing a unique characteristic to excite fans.</p>
<p>Shandui B: The fact that a group of young players surrounding You Qinggou was able to win the Shenbao Cup Group B championship is evident here. This time, with the participation of Lin Zhiren, a famous player from Group A, it feels like adding wings to a tiger, adding a central figure. However, ultimately, because they still need to hone their skills, it may be difficult to have the most ideal results, but they can be expected to achieve a middle-level position.</p>
<p>Qingxie: All of them are young and strong players. In terms of strategy, they can adapt to the current situation, using a five-man zone defense or man-to-man marking, improvising as needed, which is most commendable. Therefore, this team has a very promising future. Liu Zuxi and He Lide have the demeanor of great generals.</p>
<p>Lusheng: The entire team is tall, which is one of their prerequisites. The team members train diligently, so their shooting accuracy is remarkably high. It's a pity that they lack experience. Looking at their strength, they cannot be underestimated. However, during matches, the team sometimes has unusual errors. Given time, they have great potential.</p>
<p>Qianghua: This team is formed from former second-tier players of the Paramount Ballroom. Speaking of which, all of them were once famous players, such as Qian Jingyong, Yaleikang, Senkang, Lu Huozhen, and Wang Wenji. Their past glory can still be remembered. Ultimately, because they are old, it is difficult to compete with the young. The fourth-place position may be seized by this team.</p>
<h3>Simple Fitness Training Methods (24)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, translated from German by a German translator</p>
<p>This exercise can be seen at a glance to be similar to riding a wooden horse. The upper part of the body uses the body as a pivot, and moves forward and backward, and the legs also alternate, stretching forward and backward.</p>
<p>Hands on the waist, extend the right leg forward, and swing the body backward. When the right leg returns to its original position, the left leg immediately extends backward, while the body swings forward. Alternate touching the ground with the left and right feet (only the root of the toes touches the ground). It is best to touch the same spot, or close to it.</p>
<p>Wooden Horse Exercise: Hands on the waist: Prepare: Mount: Rest: (Three times).</p>
<p>Note: Continuous exercise for a few seconds. For individual practice, continue until breathing becomes deep and labored.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine: Climbing Stairs Exercise</p>
<p>The reason it is called climbing stairs exercise is because most people, when climbing stairs, are actually climbing, especially women.</p>
<p>Among all kinds of exercises, the most effective for strengthening the body and invigorating the mind is climbing up and down stairs, but the air in the room must be clean.</p>
<p>This exercise has three benefits: (1) strengthens leg muscles, (2) increases lung capacity, (3) regulates breathing.</p>
<p>If primary school teachers know the benefits of this exercise, they will no longer fear the labor of climbing stairs, but will instead regard it as a blessing, and will arrive at school early and go up and down several times as practice. When the day's work is finished, if you feel physically and mentally fatigued, you should go up and down several more times before going home to rest. In fact, if you can train students to do stair climbing exercises for ten minutes in the morning and afternoon, you will definitely not feel tired.</p>
<p>However, when practicing this exercise, you should pay attention to the following three characteristics:</p>
<p>First, when climbing stairs, only step on the stairs with the roots of the toes. If the whole foot is on the ground, and the heel hits hard, it will shake the brain and directly violate physiological principles.</p>
<p>Second, lean the body forward, but do not bend your back. Stick out your chest to avoid hindering breathing.</p>
<p>Third, the mouth should be kept tightly closed. (This is extremely difficult, especially if two or three people are traveling together, it is difficult to keep silent.) Every breath is a diaphragmatic breath, not a clavicular breath.</p>
<p>Do not talk when climbing the stairs, and it is best to remain silent when approaching the top of the stairs. Do not exhale all of the remaining air. Do not open your mouth under any circumstances until your breathing returns to normal. If breathing is adequate, deep, and labored, it is best to keep your mouth tightly closed; only open your mouth when your heart and lungs have returned to normal. This last point is the most important. If you can abide by it, you can increase lung capacity, and you can also benefit a lot in terms of pronunciation.</p>
<p>When descending the stairs, the body should be straight, only the knee joints should bend, and you can only step on the stairs with the heels of your toes. When walking down, walk slowly and silently, with graceful posture; each step must be firm and hidden.</p>
<p>Forty: Practice on Time</p>
<p>The way to fitness has been briefly described here, but there is still one thing to say before the end of this book. If scholars want to get the most harvest from the above-mentioned exercises, they must practice on time every day, regard it as a religious duty, and be as devout and punctual as zealous religious people are to prayer.</p>
<p>Get up every morning and do fifty flexion and extension exercises, without stopping for the rest of your life. Exercise your joints in the morning, and exercise your muscles before going to bed in the evening. After a long period of mental exertion, often do special exercises, such as lifting your heels and touching your toes to the ground.</p>
<p>Between breakfast and lunch, doing various strenuous exercises is most suitable in terms of the body.</p>
<p>After exercising in the morning and evening, if the body is strong and the reaction is good, you can wipe your body with cold water, otherwise use lukewarm water to avoid cold.</p>
<p>Do not catch a cold while bathing. Put a little salt in a bowl of water and wipe your body with it to strengthen your spirit and prevent colds or being attacked by cold air.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point. If you want to make this body a suitable dwelling for the soul, you must pay careful attention to the following three things: what you eat, what you drink, and what you think. These three are closely related to human health and cannot be ignored in the slightest. (End of full text)</p>
<h3>Two New Stars in Women's Basketball</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>In recent years, women's basketball and volleyball in Shanghai have been rising rapidly, full of vitality. Emerging strong teams such as Lianyi and Yikang can be said to be at their peak for a time, which is indeed a good phenomenon in the sports world. However, what we regret is that there are not many rising stars. Currently, among the women who are famous and enjoy the highest reputation, none are better than the Green Team. Unfortunately, the soldiers under their command are still generally veterans, such as Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Weizhen, who are all well-known early on. Recently, after Huang Xingfen, Zhang Jiazhen, Shi Ruijuan and others successively got married and left the basketball career, it made us feel the need to discover new stars even more. In this season's open basketball game, the reporter recently discovered two new comets, one is Xie Lijian from the Overseas Chinese team, and the other is Le Jiasai from the Three Provinces team. Now I will briefly describe the advantages of the two new comets to encourage the rising stars.</p>
<p>Xie Lijian</p>
<p>Miss Xie is the captain of the Overseas Chinese team. She is beautiful and healthy. She deserves the name "Lijian." Like her name, her ball-handling movements are crisp, alert, and calm, and she has the demeanor of a great general. In the crowd, her one-handed probe, standing up and shooting, is accurate in angle and is indeed a rare feat, which is admirable. In terms of skills, even compared with the Green Team's generals, she is not inferior. Given time, her attainments will be unlimited. I hope Miss Xie will take good care of herself. There are high hopes.</p>
<p>Le Jiabao</p>
<p>Miss Le is the daughter of the famous football referee Le Xiurong. As the daughter of a general's family, she has a family background and is of moderate height, lively and exquisite. She is currently a formal forward in the Three Provinces team. Her passing is agile, her basic movements are extremely commendable, and her shooting is extremely accurate. When the ball enters her hand, the opponent's defender cannot plunder it, which is especially commendable. It is said that Miss Le has not practiced basketball for many days. This season, she joined the Three Provinces team and immediately showed her talent, which is not easy.
