<h3>日軍挺身隊突擊馬尼刺繼續巷戰　繁華街市大半皆化爲灰燼</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫十四日中央社電　馬尼刺之市街戰，現依然激烈繼續中，自東方經巴科車站侵入之敵軍，巳被日軍守備部隊阻止，於巴科西方巴希格河之巴希格南岸地區，兩軍砲擊戰仍繼續進行中。尼哥爾斯機塲地區，日陸海軍部隊於緊密協力之下，刻正對擁有戰車十數輛之一千以上之敵軍勇敢舊戰中，惟自六日以來，巴科方面之敵軍一部，突出現於日軍背後，至十日該方面敵軍終於侵入尼哥爾斯機塲，將滑走路奪去，然是時日軍挺身隊，曾予敵以極大損害。又敵爲急於攻下馬尼刺起見，連日於布拉干洲馬羅羅斯東方二十公里附近，以輸送車二百輛正忙於兵員彈藥之輸送中。此外，呂宋各戰綫幾乎並無多大變化，那斯克布之敵軍，已被亞卡附近隘路口之少數日軍所阻，至十一日僅佔領約五百米寬之大道兩側，茲敵正於猛烈砲擊掩護之下，向達蓋台方面運輸戰車，對此，日軍以挺身隊突入，結果敵已連受威脅，而企圖以一部兵力自那斯克希南下，現正於那斯克希東方十五公里地點附近與日軍交戰中。又敵軍趕造那斯克希機塲，結果至十日只可供小型機之使用，至十一日，日軍挺身隊曾突入其中，並殺傷兵員達三百以上。又於巴打半鳥北部那齊布山麓一帶，兩軍仍繼續小規模作戰中。克拉克方面，據守班乃西方高地之日軍部隊，仍繼續砲擊戰，至使敵機場不能供大型飛機之使用，北部戰綫牟尼約斯日軍之守備隊，現正以少數部隊對自四面迫近之敵軍奮戰中，至九日止，已判明所獲戰果爲殺傷敵軍達三千以上。此外，並破壤火砲十五門，速射砲十門，迫擊砲六門，戰車八輛及載貨汽車多數。</p>
<p>呂宋前綫十四日中央社電　美軍侵入馬尼刺市北部之際，日軍精銳當即與之展開血戰時，當地匪賊約一萬名乘亂潛入市內，恣意於火掠奪，因此百貨店，劇塲，豪華商店，櫛比鱗次之繁華約「里沚爾」路及「埃斯克爾塔」街及其北部之中國人街，大半皆化爲灰燼，亂軍渡過巴西克河後，決戰之中心即擴大至舊城內之茵特拉合附近，兇惡之匪賊，在該地一帶亦曾大肆放火，而著名寺院，堡壘等完全燒毀，使密集於細民街之菲人及中國人，皆失逃避之處所，左右徬徨，宛如人間地獄。</p>
<h3>布累斯勞附近　德發動反攻　洪京守軍突破包圍綱</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　中西里西亞之大戰，仍富流動性，戰事現已擴大至羅勃河之支流蓋斯河一帶，蘇軍猛攻薩根城被擊退，柯尼埃夫包圍布累斯勞之計劃又吿失敗。自該城向西之走廊，經德軍側攻後，反見擴大，然蘇軍仍於布累斯勞與里格尼茲間增援，先鋒已抵里格尼茲南二十公里處之郁爾城。現集於布累斯勞前線之蘇軍，除第二裝甲軍外，復有四軍團及若十獨立部隊，預料該處激戰仍將發生。里格尼茲布累斯勞公路上，現有蘇軍數師向東南推進，另有蘇軍五師，正自布里格奧勞橋頭堡向北及西北推進，以圖包圍布累斯勞，目前尙無顯著戰果可言。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　最近歐洲戰况：（一）東線布累斯勞附近之蘇軍，企圖將該市包圍，但德軍發動反攻，終將蘇軍聯絡切斷該地與柏林交通之企圖完全摧毀，因之柏林南冀防衛線之危機全部解除。高奈夫等之有力部隊，自里格尼茲地區開始行動，對伺隙包圍布累斯勞之蘇軍部隊從事增援，該方面德軍反攻，獲得相當成果，擊毀蘇戰車六十輛。又蘇軍爲切斷東普魯士地區之德軍後方聯絡，使埃爾平與哥尼斯堡街市陷於猛烈砲火中。其守備布達佩斯之德洪兩軍，於一切食糧物資補給完全之後，轉動野戰，突於十三日拂曉集合全部兵力，試行突破蘇軍之包圍網，德軍之突擊，全乘蘇軍之虛，不予反擊之餘暇，使蘇軍三聯隊均被殲滅，潰不成軍</p>
<p>西綫戰况</p>
<p>（二）西線美第三軍，於盧森堡國境連結愚西迭那茲波埃特海二橋頭堡企圖北上，亦爲德軍之猛砲攻擊所阻，以西線戰局觀之，北翼反軸心軍攻勢似稍有成果，南翼德軍之守備則依然强固。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　海通社訊；西綫戰事叛心，仍在繆司河與瓦爾河間，英加軍突入處，以及許納埃斐爾，普魯姆，及沙爾橋頭堡等處，下阿爾薩斯則僅有局部戰，瓦爾河與克里夫間地面泥濘，僅較乾燥之公路綫上有反軸心軍推進、英戰車先鋒被阻於克里夫南及東南數公里處，英軍圖渡尼爾斯河未果，魯爾區水勢續漲，敵軍不得不迅速從事撤退。</p>
<p>日本海軍「天山」式新銳攻擊機</p>
<h3>贛州　—重要鎢鑛產地　日軍遂贛作戰之收穫</h3>
<p>舊臘二十八日攻陷遂川以後，迫擊敗走的渝軍第十四師而一氣進抵贛州的日軍快速部隊，二月五日晨突入贛州飛機塲，加以佔領，同日黃昏並攻下縣城。自遂川至贛州的急進追擊翻越萬洋山系叢山間險峻山道。迫近贛州時，渝軍因日軍挺進過速，無暇徹底破壞道路，僅僅掘壞路面而已。</p>
<p>贛州機場</p>
<p>贛州飛機塲位於章江的大灣曲部分，和遂川飛機塲比較，新築的氣息很强。飛機塲西側的松林中，有各種建築物散在其間，附屬設備並不亞於攙川。當日軍佔領遂川飛機塲時，曾有約二十架的已壞飛機遺留塲中，但贛州機場僅有六架已燒燬的飛機殘骸。</p>
<p>贛州縣城位於贛江與章江的會合點，城牆高約六米，寬約四米，有人口六萬餘。城內與遂川的光景逈異，不見一個碉堡。渝軍當日是據守城堡抵抗的，迨日軍肉搏衝入後，立即退走，故城內幾乎沒有損害。</p>
<p>日軍目的</p>
<p>此次日軍進攻遂贛的目的，在於傾覆渝美空軍根據地。此外收穫的偉大戰果，其一爲取得贛州縣城內外一千五百噸以上的銅礦，（鍊鑛可能度八〇％以上）。鎢爲製造飛機等各種重要兵器的貴金屬，查此次作戰地點是江西省一帶，是世界重要的產鎢地。此項鋦鑛，爲重慶抵償美蘇援蔣物資的重要東西。日方爲利用這資源起見，在此次打通粵漢線進攻遂贛的作戰中，早就組成貴金屬資源調查班，隨軍前進，實地調查，以備開發。茲據贛州縣內所獲的渝方文書中，報吿江西省一帶最近的鎢鑛生產狀况如次：</p>
<p>鎢鑛產量</p>
<p>江西省鎢鑛年產額約一萬噸（已經選鑛者），其主要產地計有：大庾·崇義·虔南·會昌·龍南·泰和·興國·遂川·零都·上猶·南康等（以出產多寡爲序），鑛山如大庾縣西華山·虔南縣大吉山·龍南縣歸萬山等較著，贛縣境內，有筆架山·白石山等大小約十八個鑛山。所採鑛石，因運輸力關係，大體在鑛山選鑛，然後利用河川道路，運至南雄·贛縣·信豐·大庾等中繼地。過去在江西省政府資源委員會鎢業管理署下設立辦事處，選鑛之後，即利用粵漢線運往桂林方面，向美蘇輸出。但自去春日軍湖南作戰以還，陷於不能運出的境地，故自去年七月起，已停止採掘。（譯目二月十四日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>日軍在贛州　獲大量兵器</h3>
<p>大陸前線基地十四日中央社電　日軍在華作戰部隊，十日於贛州附近沒收渝軍兵器甚多，其主要物品如次：十五生的榴彈五七六，該彈爆炸管六〇〇方形，黃色藥四噸，黑色火藥七二〇噸，地雷二四〇，導火器五六〇，雷管五〇〇，手榴彈一三五〇枚。</p>
<h3>美聯邦局提議　减少準備金</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　德國社訊，華盛頓息：美聯邦準備局頃向美上院銀行委員會提出數案，要求減少美準備銀行之金準備及存款，該提議要求美紙幣之準備金改爲百分之二十五，而存金之準備金亦應爲百分之二十五，原來之紙幣準備金爲百分之四十，存金之準備爲百分之三十五，據稱：減低紙幣之赤金準備實屬必要，蓋美紙幣之發行已超過二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，美元之數也。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>疏散人口與限制入口</h3>
<p>昨天我們提出「新春第一事」，希望居住於上海的市民，過了春節以後，應即考慮疏散回鄉問題。</p>
<p>我們曾在本月六日社評中說：「過去上海有了租界，可以包庇一切犯罪行爲，可以不問國家的事，可以不問社會的事。甚至迫近租界以外的戰事，祇須處身租界，就可高臥了聽砲聲，不受波及，仍可盡情享樂。」這是過去上海境內，因爲有了租界而產生的畸形現象，養成了一班當租界作爲安樂土，護身符的依賴虫。但自大東亞戰爭發動以後，租界立即失去根基，至前年八月以後，租界一律接收，租界的名稱成爲陳跡，而過去依賴租界的畸形現象，也就失去屏障。因此，我們竭力喚醒這種依頓迷夢，凡是不必要居留上海的人，從速考慮疏散，尤其是老弱婦孺以及無事庽公，慈善團體等等，均須早作準備。同時，盼望政府當局對於各地治安，速籌確保，俾使疏散歸鄕者，得到生活上的安寗保障。</p>
<p>不過，與實施疏散人口同樣應予注意的，而且必須與疏散同時實行的，還有限制人口進入市區問題。一方面實行疏散，一方面實行限制進口，才能收到疏散的實效。如果只實行疏散，而同時不予限制進口，那末，一面雖有疏散，而一面仍有進口，豈不是等於未加疏散，結果完全失去了疏散的意義，不能收到疏散的效果。</p>
<p>所以，我們主張一面實施疏散，同時實行進口限制。至於限制進口辦法的規定與實施，下列數點可以參考：</p>
<p>（一）規定人口進入上海市區限制辦法及實施日期，凡在上海並無正當職業者，在實行限制以後，不准入口。所謂正當職業者，應嚴格規定職業範圍，凡與戰時環境直接與間接不必要者，雖有職業亦不在許可範圍之內，例如從業於娛樂塲所，旅館菜館，工商業中之有消耗奢侈與投機牟利性質者。另一方面，在規定職業範圍內准許入口者，應持有服務機關或團體向入口管理之主管機關申請准許文件，否則亦不准入口。</p>
<p>（二）交通機關，如火車汽車輪船等等，在外埠載運旅客來滬，於售票時，應同時查騐有無上海市區入口管理機關之准許證書，如無此項准許證害者，不售客票。</p>
<p>（三）凡原在上海有正當職業者，因事離滬仍須回歸者，應於離滬前先向主管機關取得回滬入口准許書。如在實行限制辦法之前離滬而仍須回歸者，應由其服務處所代向申請寄遞，以備來滬時騐用。</p>
<p>（四）保甲機關對於申請市民證發給，如非原在滬市區移動者，應同時查騐有無准許人口證書，否則拒絕並勒令離滬。</p>
<p>（五）凡有正當職業者之家屬有同居必要者，其移動與入口辦法與本人同。</p>
<p>（六）在上海市區各入口處所，（包括水陸碼頭交界鐵門），均派員查騐入口准許書，或委託各該地服務之軍警人員執行，並隨時派員檢查。</p>
<p>最後，盼望市府當局注意及此，制定限制辦法，並設置管理機構，或即附設保甲處負責辦理。惟申請核辦手續，應採取公正態度，迅速處理，給予申請人以絕對的便利。</p>
<h3>三頭會議結束　發表共同宣言　稱已擬定聯合軍事計劃</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國社訊，倫教消息稱：羅斯福·邱吉爾·斯達林星期一晚發表共同宣言謂：英·美·蘇之領袖，於克里米亞海岸雅爾太會商後，三國間之軍事合作，較以前更爲密切，但此項聯合軍事計劃，須待實施時始行宣布。此密切之合作，或可使戰爭縮短，三國之參謀人員，以後隨時因需要而繼續會議，德國若繼續其無希望之抗戰，則僅加重其本國戰敗之代價。反軸心國已決定使德國無條件投降之計劃，但此項計劃須待最後擊敗德國時始能宣吿，反軸心將使德國以物品賠償戰爭之損失，並將設立一賠償委員會於莫斯科，以辦理之。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　德國社訊，華盛頓息：美戰事動員局局長貝尼斯，昨由羅斯福·邱吉爾·斯達林會議地點返國，數小時後宣稱：刻下聚議之反軸心國軍事領軸，正計劃於本年三月中動用較以往各時期爲多之人力及物資。</p>
<p>白宮宣布會談經過</p>
<p>里斯本十中央社電　華盛頓電稱：美白宮當局對克里米亞會談經過十二日，曾宣稱如次：羅斯福大總統一行，於二月二日抵馬爾太島後，即與英首相邱吉爾，美國務卿斯蒂汀紐斯，美駐蘇大使哈里曼，大總統顧問霍浦金，參謀總長馬歇爾，海軍作戰部長金格及其他軍政技術顧問等會見。馬爾太島會談開始後，羅斯福首　與馬歇爾及金格會談，繼之與邱吉爾會談，羅斯福與邱吉爾，於二日共進晚餐後，當夜即飛赴克里米亞沿岸之蘇維埃海港，於斯達林代表莫洛托夫外務人民委員出迎之下，羅斯福當乘車至黑海沿岸之舊俄皇尼古拉二世別墅里維亞迭亞，會談即於該別墅內舉行，自二月五日開始日夜繼續舉行後，至十一日始吿終了。</p>
<p>波蘭問題解決辦法</p>
<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國社訊：羅斯福·邱吉爾·斯達林三人在克里米亞會議中，决定解决波蘭問題之辦法如次：波蘭經蘇軍完全解放後，有設立臨時政府之必要，現時在波蘭活動之新政府，應依照更廣大之民主基礎而改組，包羅國內外之波人民主領袖。此新政府之名義，應改爲波蘭國民聯合臨時政府，蘇外長莫洛托夫·美駐蘇大使哈里曼·英駐蘇大使寇爾，已受命在莫斯科與波蘭之領袖會商，依照前述之原則，改組波政府。俟新政府組織成立後，英·美·蘇政府即將與之樹立外交關係，並互派使節，波蘭之東面邊境，應依照寇松線而在數處略作有利於波蘭之修改，至於西南邊界，則須留待和平會議决定。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦消息稱：倫敦波蘭流亡政府昨日發表公報稱，在克里米亞會議開始之前，波政府曾致牒英·美政府，聲明關於有關波蘭命運之決議，若未經與波政府商議及得波政府之同意，則波政府將採不理之態度。</p>
<p>德官方評雅爾太會</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　海通社訊，德外部發言人昨稱：雅爾太會議之公報，實爲至佳，蓋德國之領袖，正可用以激發德國人民之鬥志也。公報之內，僅見仇恨與毀滅他人之決意，敵人之得以携手，亦僅賴有此耳，德國對於此事，從未忽略或否認，其關於德國之各點，實毋庸加以討論。德人讀此公報之後，即覺寗願忍受痛苦，而決不願使此公報有付諸施行之一日。我千百萬之德人，決澈底犧牲，從事遊擊戰術，每一德人，當於死亡以前，先將敵人拖入墳墓，德人常以殺人之手段，報復殺人之手段。八千萬德人，均知如何自衛之方法，由此觀之，雅爾太之公報，反足激發我敵愾同仇之心理，事之愚魯未有逾於此者。發言人繼謂，余不信德國之軍事力量不能於最近改變戰局，德國在歷史上有更危於今日者，顧敵人勿忽略德國超越之軍事，政治領袖人才，以及蘇軍孤軍深入一危險。</p>
<p>巴黎方面深感失望</p>
<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國社訊，合衆社消息稱：巴黎方面因特戈爾並未被邀參加克里米亞會議而深感失望，會議之公報，又顯示羅斯福·邱吉爾·斯達林三人仍視法國爲次等國，故巴黎方面所感失望更深。</p>
<h3>蘇聯羅馬尼亞修正停戰協定</h3>
<p>日內瓦十四日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦星期泰晤士報載稱：蘇聯與羅馬尼亞已簽訂一停戰協定之修正案，由羅馬尼亞於六年之內，以物品賠償蘇聯，其總額爲美金三萬萬元，羅國應以油·穀·木材·船隻及機械等物交與蘇聯。</p>
<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾　將訪問義希</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國社訊，巴黎消息靈通方面稱：羅期福總統參加克里米亞會議後，於返美前或將往羅馬訪問敎皇。</p>

<h3>日軍作戰方法　在繫滅敵兵力　松島部長談呂宋島戰局</h3>
<p>日駐華艦報這部長松島大佐，頃縱觀目敵美軍侵入呂宋島以來之戰况，特發表戰局談話，指出敵軍戰略之失敗，並謂未來之決戰，實爲決定大東亞興亡之戰爭，是故大東亞十億民族應一致團結奮起邁進，茲讀其要旨如次：</p>
<p>敵美目開始在仁牙因濁登陸以來，倐已五週，敵人之戰果僅不過縱斷呂宋島平原，抵達無戰略價値之文化都市馬尼拉而已，對殲滅對方兵力上則亳無成果，且呂宋島日軍仍能確保戰略要地，而其基幹部隊亦毫未受損失，因此美軍五週來之苦戰結果，不過在地圖上獲得成功而已。要之，爭奪地域無甚價値，唯有山下將軍作戰指導，始有無限期待。</p>
<p>敵方企圖孤注一擲</p>
<p>又麥克沃塞已將其大部兵力調往呂宋一帶，且更於馬里亞納方面結集大軍，積極增援，敵方之積極進攻菲島，無非想孤注一擲進而深入日方內綫，然此點約有三種可能性：第一侵寇日本本土，第二大陸登陸，第三在亞洲東南之半島部登陸，其中敵人所期望者，則爲在日本本土登陸，然其必將遭遇强烈之抵抗。第三點關於亞洲東南之半島登陸，此即由越南至馬來間之地帶登陸，以呼應緬甸方面之反軸心軍，然極無戰略效果，故第二之於中國大陸登敵人企圖已久，然此亦不會輕易成功，敵人於菲律賓未獲相當戰果，即使侵入駐華派遺軍及駐華艦隊嚴密防備之中國大陸，亦絕不有成功可言，敵方今後必將遭受更大消耗，而日本對作戰指導，專在繫滅敵兵力，吾東亞十億民族，應奮起洗雪過去百年之仇。</p>
<h3>敵方虛僞宣傳　眞相漸暴露　美軍不法行爲令人髪指</h3>
<p>頃自消息靈通方面探悉，美國自菲島作戰以來，頻施其奸猾之虛僞宣傳手段，揚言以民族解放爲目的，向菲島人民作種種之誘惑，並宣傳：「美軍進入呂宋時，菲列濱人民舉手歡迎，尤其在斯比克灣登陸時，菲列濱人民高展美國星條國旗，表示歡迎，故登陸艦隊不發一砲。在菲島各地菲人游繫隊，亦頗爲活動」云云。其實敵美在菲列濱作戰，益感艱苦，且菲人協力量，未能如敵美宣傳之預想。麥克沃塞亦謂：「菲列濱人民有協助美國，然亦有與日本協力作戰者，故菲列濱人民協力之力量，爲日美兩國所共通，故我人對菲列濱人民之歡迎態度，未可輕易置信」云云。又由另一宣傳中吾人可知其方面已轉對當地華僑着眼：「當地華僑協力出動作游繫作戰，尤以馬尼剌市之縱火舉動，即係華僑所爲。」然以前敵美亦曾謂馬尼剌縱火，係日軍自爲，前後對照，即可見其予盾，敵美宣傳之荒謬，於此漸漸暴露矣。</p>
<p>如敵美對其佔領地有理想之良好政策指導，則目前法義諸國，自不會發生空前之悲慘情形，試以義大利被美軍蹂躍後之慘酷情况而言，人民流爲乞丐竊盜，賣淫女郞隨處可見，未滿一歲之嬰孩死亡率特高，民不聊生，束手待斃之慘狀，亦足爲沉醉敵美宣傳者戒。敵美宣傳與事實之相反，由此可見</p>
<p>本月四日在渝蓉之美駐重慶軍隊對良家婦女及招待歌女施以橫行，姦淫虜掠，無惡不作，更有甚者，美軍强將婦女挾登其汽車輪姦，致遭慘死，在街頭之美軍對行路婦女恣意調笑，凡此種種，當地人民莫不髪指，渝外交部長吳國楨已向美國提出嚴重抗議，美國一味敷衍置之不理。吾人對美軍此種非人道行爲，一方面固係人種差別所致，另一方亦可爲對東亞人特別是中國人之蔑視傳統心理之表現。最近上海人士尙有對戰局表示懷疑者，美國是否能給予幸福，此種觀念亟應革除，尤應堅定勝利信急，拒美英在中國大陸登陸，振作精神，爲東亞解放而奮鬥。</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Attack Unit Raids Manila, Continued Street Fighting; Most of the Bustling City Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The street fighting in Manila is still ongoing intensely. The enemy forces that invaded from the east via Paco Station have been blocked by the Japanese garrison. A artillery battle between the two armies continues in the Paco western region of the southern bank of the Pasig River. In the Nichols Airfield area, Japanese army and naval forces are cooperating closely and fighting bravely against over a thousand enemy soldiers with a dozen tanks. However, a part of the enemy forces from the Paco area suddenly appeared behind the Japanese army since the 6th. By the 10th, these enemy forces finally invaded Nichols Airfield and captured the runway. At this time, a Japanese special attack unit inflicted great damage on the enemy. Moreover, in order to quickly capture Manila, the enemy has been busily transporting troops and ammunition using two hundred transport vehicles near Marilao, 20 kilometers east of Bulacan Province, for several days. Apart from this, there has been little change on the other Luzon front lines. The enemy at Nasugbu has been blocked by a small number of Japanese soldiers at the narrow pass near Ayala. By the 11th, they had only occupied both sides of the main road, which was about 500 meters wide. The enemy is currently transporting tanks towards Dagat via heavy artillery cover. In response, a Japanese special attack unit infiltrated, resulting in the enemy being repeatedly threatened. They are attempting to move a portion of their forces south from Nasugbu and are currently engaging in combat with the Japanese army near a location 15 kilometers east of Nasugbu. Additionally, the enemy hastily constructed the Nasugbu Airfield, but by the 10th, it could only be used by small aircraft. On the 11th, a Japanese special attack unit infiltrated it, killing and wounding over 300 enemy soldiers. Also, in the northern Bataan peninsula, near the foothills of Mount Natib, small-scale battles between the two armies continue. In the Clark area, the Japanese forces guarding the western highlands of Banay continue their artillery fire, preventing the enemy's airfield from being used by large aircraft. On the northern front line, the Japanese garrison in Muñoz is currently fighting bravely against enemy forces approaching from all directions with a small force. Up to the 9th, it has been confirmed that the achieved results include killing or wounding over 3,000 enemy soldiers, destroying 15 artillery pieces, 10 rapid-fire guns, 6 mortars, 8 tanks, and numerous cargo trucks.</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – When American forces invaded the northern part of Manila, the elite Japanese forces immediately engaged them in fierce battle. At this time, about 10,000 local bandits took advantage of the chaos to sneak into the city and plunder at will. As a result, most of the bustling "Escolta" street and its northern Chinese Quarter, lined with department stores, theaters, and luxurious shops, were reduced to ashes. After the rebel army crossed the Pasig River, the center of the decisive battle expanded to the Intramuros area of the old city. The vicious bandits also set fires on a large scale in this area, and famous temples, fortresses, etc., were completely burned down, leaving Filipinos and Chinese crowded in the narrow streets without any place to escape, bewildered and helpless, as if in a living hell.</p>
<h3>Vicinity of Breslau, Germany Launches Counteroffensive; Hungarian Garrison Breaks Through Encirclement</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The great battle in Central-Western Silesia remains fluid. The fighting has now expanded to the Geis River, a tributary of the Lohbr River. The Soviet army's fierce attack on Sagan was repelled, and Konev's plan to encircle Breslau has failed again. The corridor west of the city has expanded due to German flanking attacks. However, the Soviet army is still reinforcing between Breslau and Liegnitz, with the vanguard reaching Jauer, 20 kilometers south of Liegnitz. The Soviet forces currently gathered on the Breslau front include the Second Armored Corps, four army groups, and around ten independent units. Fierce fighting is expected to continue there. Several Soviet divisions are advancing southeast on the Liegnitz-Breslau highway, while another five Soviet divisions are advancing north and northwest from the Brzeg bridgehead, attempting to encircle Breslau, but there have been no significant results so far.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Recent European War Situation: (1) The Soviet army near Breslau in the Eastern Front attempted to encircle the city, but the German army launched a counteroffensive, ultimately cutting off the Soviet connection and completely destroying the enemy attempt to cut off transportation between the area and Berlin, thus completely relieving the crisis on the southern defense line of Berlin. Konev's powerful troops, starting from the Liegnitz area, reinforced the Soviet forces attempting to encircle Breslau at every opportunity. The German counteroffensive in that area achieved considerable results, destroying 60 Soviet tanks. Also, in order to cut off the German rear lines of communication in the East Prussia area, the Soviet army subjected the cities of Elbing and Königsberg to intense artillery fire. The German-Hungarian forces defending Budapest, after completing all food and material supplies, turned to field warfare, and on the 13th at dawn, they gathered all their forces to attempt to break through the Soviet encirclement. The German attack took advantage of the Soviet's vulnerability, giving them no time to counterattack, and three Soviet regiments were annihilated and routed.</p>
<p>Western Front Situation</p>
<p>(2) On the Western Front, the US Third Army's attempt to link the Remich-Echternach-Wellen-Losheim bridgeheads in Luxembourg and move north was also blocked by heavy German artillery fire. Looking at the Western Front situation, the Allied offensive on the northern wing seems to have had some success, while the German defenses on the southern wing remain strong.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports: The fighting on the Western Front is mainly occurring between the Meuse and Waal rivers, where the British-Canadian forces have broken through, as well as at the Hürtgenwald, Prüm, and Saar bridgeheads. In Lower Alsace, there is only local fighting. The ground between the Waal River and Cleves is muddy, and the Allied advance is only possible on relatively dry roads. The British tank vanguard has been blocked a few kilometers south and southeast of Cleves. The British attempt to cross the Niers River failed. The water level in the Ruhr area continues to rise, forcing the enemy to quickly retreat.</p>

<h3>Ganzhou – An Important Tungsten Ore Producing Area; Gains from the Japanese Army's Operations in Gan</h3>
<p>After capturing Suichuan on the 28th day of the old year (Lunar year), the Japanese rapid deployment forces, which relentlessly pursued the fleeing Chongqing army's 14th Division, reached and occupied the Ganzhou airfield on the morning of February 5th. On the same day, at dusk, they also captured the county seat. The rapid pursuit from Suichuan to Ganzhou involved traversing the treacherous mountain roads in the Wanyang Mountain range. When approaching Ganzhou, the Chongqing army, due to the rapid advance of the Japanese army, had no time to thoroughly destroy the roads and only damaged the road surface.</p>
<p>Ganzhou Airfield</p>
<p>The Ganzhou airfield is located in the large bend of the Zhang River. Compared to the Suichuan airfield, it has a stronger sense of being newly constructed. In the pine forest west of the airfield, there are various buildings scattered around, and the auxiliary facilities are no less than those in Suichuan. When the Japanese army occupied the Suichuan airfield, about twenty damaged aircraft were left in the field, but the Ganzhou airfield only had the remains of six burnt aircraft.</p>
<p>The Ganzhou county seat is located at the confluence of the Gan River and the Zhang River. The city wall is about six meters high and four meters wide, with a population of over 60,000. The scene inside the city is very different from that of Suichuan, with not a single bunker to be seen. The Chongqing army defended the city, but when the Japanese army charged in with bayonets, they immediately retreated, so the city was almost undamaged.</p>
<p>Objectives of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>The purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Suichuan and Ganzhou was to destroy the Chongqing-US air force base. In addition to this great strategic outcome, one of the great achievements was the acquisition of over 1,500 tons of copper ore (with a probability of over 80% that it would be refined) inside and outside the Ganzhou county seat. Tungsten is a precious metal used to manufacture airplanes and other important weapons. The location of this operation is in Jiangxi Province, which is a world-important tungsten-producing area. This tungsten ore is an important resource for Chongqing to repay the US and Soviet aid to Chiang Kai-shek. In order to utilize this resource, the Japanese side formed a precious metal resource investigation team to advance with the army during this operation to open the Yuehan Railway and attack Suichuan and Ganzhou, to conduct on-the-spot investigations in preparation for development. According to Chongqing documents obtained in Ganzhou County, the recent tungsten ore production status in the Jiangxi Province area is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Tungsten Ore Production</p>
<p>The annual tungsten ore production in Jiangxi Province is approximately 10,000 tons (after ore dressing). The main producing areas include: Dayu, Chongyi, Qiannan, Huichang, Longnan, Taihe, Xingguo, Suichuan, Lingdu, Shangyou, Nankang, etc. (in order of output). The mines such as Xihua Mountain in Dayu County, Dajishan in Qiannan County, and Guiwan Mountain in Longnan County are well-known. Within Ganzhou County, there are about eighteen mines of various sizes, such as Bijia Mountain and Baishi Mountain. Due to transportation limitations, the mined ore is generally dressed at the mine and then transported to intermediate locations such as Nanxiong, Ganzhou, Xinfeng, and Dayu using rivers and roads. In the past, an office was established under the Jiangxi Provincial Government Resources Committee's Tungsten Industry Administration Office. After the ore was dressed, it was transported to Guilin via the Yuehan Railway for export to the United States and the Soviet Union. However, since the Japanese army's operations in Hunan last spring, it has been impossible to transport it, so mining has been suspended since July of last year. (Translated from the February 14th Continental New Report)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Obtains Large Quantities of Weapons in Ganzhou</h3>
<p>Mainland Front Base, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the 10th, Japanese forces operating in China confiscated a large number of Chongqing army weapons near Ganzhou. The main items are as follows: 576 15cm howitzer shells, 600 square detonators for the shells, 4 tons of yellow explosive, 720 tons of black powder, 240 landmines, 560 fuses, 500 detonators, and 1,350 hand grenades.</p>
<h3>US Federal Reserve Proposes to Reduce Reserve Requirements</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from Washington: The US Federal Reserve Board has submitted several proposals to the US Senate Banking Committee, requesting a reduction in the gold reserves and deposits of the US Federal Reserve Banks. The proposal requests that the reserve for US paper currency be changed to 25%, and the reserve for gold deposits should also be 25%. The original paper currency reserve was 40%, and the gold deposit reserve was 35%. It is claimed that reducing the gold reserve for paper currency is necessary because the issuance of US paper currency has exceeded $25,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Population Evacuation and Entry Restrictions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we proposed "The First Task of the New Year," hoping that citizens living in Shanghai should consider evacuating back to their hometowns after the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>We said in our editorial on the 6th of this month: "In the past, Shanghai had concessions that could protect all criminal behavior, ignore national affairs, and ignore social affairs. Even when battles were approaching outside the concessions, one could simply stay within the concessions, lie down and listen to the sound of artillery, and remain unaffected, still enjoying life to the fullest." This was the abnormal phenomenon that arose in Shanghai due to the existence of concessions, fostering a group of dependent parasites who treated the concessions as a land of comfort and a protective talisman. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the concessions immediately lost their foundation. After August of the year before last, all concessions were taken over, and the name "concession" became a relic of the past, and the abnormal phenomenon of relying on the concessions also lost its shield. Therefore, we are doing our best to awaken this dream of dependence. Those who do not need to reside in Shanghai should consider evacuating as soon as possible, especially the elderly, weak, women, children, and those who are idly spending public funds, charitable organizations, etc., should all prepare early. At the same time, we hope that the government authorities will quickly plan to ensure security in various regions so that those who evacuate back to their hometowns can receive a secure guarantee of life.</p>
<p>However, what should be paid the same attention to as implementing population evacuation, and what must be implemented simultaneously with evacuation, is the issue of restricting the entry of the population into the urban area. Implementing evacuation on one hand and implementing import restrictions on the other hand can achieve the real effect of evacuation. If only evacuation is implemented, and import is not restricted at the same time, then while there is evacuation on one side, there is still import on the other side. Wouldn't that be equivalent to not evacuating at all, completely losing the meaning of evacuation, and failing to achieve the effect of evacuation?</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate implementing evacuation on one hand and implementing import restrictions at the same time. As for the regulations and implementation of import restriction measures, the following points can be referred to:</p>
<p>(1) Stipulate the regulations for restricting the entry of the population into the Shanghai urban area and the date of implementation. Those who do not have a legitimate occupation in Shanghai will not be allowed to enter after the implementation of the restrictions. The so-called legitimate occupation should strictly define the scope of occupations. Those that are directly or indirectly unnecessary for the wartime environment, even if they have an occupation, are not within the scope of permission, such as those employed in entertainment venues, hotels, restaurants, and industries and businesses with consumptive, luxurious, or speculative profiteering natures. On the other hand, those who are allowed to enter within the specified scope of occupations should hold a permission document applied for by the service agency or organization to the competent authority for import management; otherwise, they will not be allowed to enter either.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation agencies, such as trains, buses, ships, etc., should simultaneously check whether passengers carrying passengers to Shanghai from other places have an entry permit from the Shanghai urban area import management agency when selling tickets. Those who do not have this permit should not be sold passenger tickets.</p>
<p>(3) Those who originally had a legitimate occupation in Shanghai, but who have left Shanghai for some reason and still need to return, should first obtain a return entry permit from the competent authority before leaving Shanghai. If they have left Shanghai before the implementation of the restriction measures and still need to return, their service place should apply on their behalf and send it to them for verification when they come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(4) The Baojia (local security) agencies, when applying for the issuance of citizen certificates, should simultaneously check whether there is an entry permit, if it is not a relocation within the original Shanghai urban area; otherwise, they should refuse and order them to leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>(5) The relocation and entry methods for family members of those with legitimate occupations who need to live together are the same as those for the person themselves.</p>
<p>(6) Staff should be stationed at each entry point in the Shanghai urban area (including waterways, docks, border iron gates) to verify entry permits, or entrusted to military and police personnel serving in each area to execute, and inspections should be carried out at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the Municipal Government authorities will pay attention to this, formulate restriction measures, and establish management agencies, or simply attach them to the Baojia Office to be responsible for handling them. However, the application and verification procedures should adopt a fair attitude, be handled quickly, and provide applicants with absolute convenience.</p>
<h3>The Three-Headed Meeting Ends; Joint Declaration Issued; States that a Joint Military Plan Has Been Drafted</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from London that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin issued a joint declaration on Monday evening, stating that after consultations in Yalta on the Crimean coast, military cooperation among the three countries is closer than ever before, but this joint military plan will be announced only when it is implemented. This close cooperation may shorten the war. The staff members of the three countries will continue to meet at any time as needed. If Germany continues its hopeless resistance, it will only increase the price of its defeat. The Allies have decided on a plan for Germany's unconditional surrender, but this plan can only be announced when Germany is finally defeated. The Allies will make Germany compensate for the losses of the war with goods and will establish a compensation committee in Moscow to handle it.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from Washington: US War Mobilization Bureau Director James F. Byrnes, returned from the meeting location of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin yesterday, and declared a few hours later that the Allied military leaders currently meeting are planning to use more manpower and materials in March of this year than in any previous period.</p>
<p>White House Announces Details of the Meeting</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A Washington dispatch states that the US White House announced the following details of the Crimean meeting on the 12th: President Roosevelt and his party arrived in Malta on February 2nd and met with British Prime Minister Churchill, US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman, Presidential Advisor Harry Hopkins, Chief of Staff George Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King, and other military, political, and technical advisors. After the Malta meeting began, Roosevelt first met with Marshall and King, followed by a meeting with Churchill. Roosevelt and Churchill had dinner together on the 2nd, and that night they flew to a Soviet port on the Crimean coast. Under the welcoming of Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Roosevelt took a car to Livadia, the former Black Sea coastal villa of Russian Emperor Nicholas II. The meeting was held inside the villa and began on February 5th, continuing day and night until it ended on the 11th.</p>
<p>Solution to the Polish Problem</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin decided on the following solution to the Polish problem at the Crimean Conference: After Poland is completely liberated by the Soviet army, it is necessary to establish a temporary government. The new government currently operating in Poland should be reorganized on a broader democratic basis, encompassing the democratic leaders of the Polish people at home and abroad. The name of this new government should be changed to the Polish National United Provisional Government. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr have been ordered to meet with Polish leaders in Moscow to reorganize the Polish government in accordance with the aforementioned principles. After the new government is organized, the British, American, and Soviet governments will establish diplomatic relations with it and exchange envoys. Poland's eastern border should follow the Curzon Line, with slight modifications in several places favorable to Poland. As for the southwestern border, it must be left to the peace conference to decide.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports from London that the Polish government-in-exile in London issued a communiqué yesterday stating that before the start of the Crimean Conference, the Polish government had sent a note to the British and American governments, stating that with regard to decisions concerning Poland's fate, if they were not discussed with the Polish government and with the consent of the Polish government, the Polish government would take a disregardful attitude.</p>
<p>German Official Comments on the Yalta Conference</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports, the German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said yesterday: "The Yalta Conference communiqué is excellent, as the German leaders can use it to inspire the fighting spirit of the German people. Within the communiqué, only hatred and a determination to destroy others are seen. The enemies are only able to join hands because of this. Germany has never neglected or denied this matter. The points concerning Germany do not need to be discussed. After reading this communiqué, Germans feel that they would rather endure pain than allow this communiqué to be implemented one day. Millions of Germans will thoroughly sacrifice themselves and engage in guerrilla tactics. Every German will drag the enemy into the grave before they die. Germans often use the means of killing to retaliate for the means of killing. Eighty million Germans all know how to defend themselves. From this point of view, the Yalta communiqué has instead stimulated the psychological motivation for us to hate the enemy with the same hate. No matter is more stupid than this.” The spokesperson continued, "I do not believe that Germany's military strength cannot change the war situation in the near future. Germany has had more dangerous times in history than today. However, enemies should not ignore Germany's transcendent military and political leadership talents, as well as the danger of the Soviet army's deep penetration."</p>
<p>Paris Feels Deeply Disappointed</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – DNB reports, UP reports that Paris feels deeply disappointed that de Gaulle was not invited to participate in the Crimean Conference.

Director Zhou delivered instructions, with much emphasis on encouragement. Subsequently, Director Zhou gave detailed instructions and conducted thorough discussions on the promotion of police work, and stipulated that each division and section must submit a written report on their work every week for review to increase work efficiency. The meeting concluded around 12:00 PM. It is also understood that Director Zhou is very concerned about the promotion of police affairs in each branch bureau and will convene individual talks with the newly appointed branch bureau chiefs starting this week to hear reports on police operations.</p>

<h3>Consumption Tax Should Be Paid for Private Banquets of Civil Servants, etc., Severe Action Will Be Taken Against Those Who Refuse</h3>
<p>The City Wine and Restaurant Trade Association has reported that disputes often arise when civil servants and military police officers refuse to pay the special consumption tax for private banquets, greatly hindering tax revenue. They have repeatedly petitioned the City Finance Bureau for instructions on how to handle this. To clarify the truth of this matter, this reporter interviewed a responsible person from the Finance Bureau yesterday, who stated: According to investigation, official banquets of government agencies are exempt from the special consumption tax on banquets, but only if the government agency has supporting documents for the bureau to verify before it takes effect. Private banquets of civil servants and military police officers are not exempt from tax, and the municipal government has already issued an order to comply. The special consumption tax is an important source of state revenue under the wartime system. All civil servants and military police officers are role models for the people and should be mindful of the difficult times. All private banquets should be taxed in accordance with regulations to maintain tax policy. In addition to submitting a request to the municipal government to issue a notice to be posted in various liquor businesses to inform the public, severe investigations will be conducted and no leniency will be shown if there are still cases of refusing to pay the special consumption tax on banquets.</p>

<h3>Securities Exchange Supervisory Office Sets Principles for Reviewing Stock Listings</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Exchange Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Finance believes that the original principles for reviewing applications for stock listings by companies, set by the Shanghai Securities Exchange, were too broad. Therefore, the office has formulated twelve articles of rules for reviewing stock listings on the Shanghai Securities Exchange to impose strict restrictions and prevent malpractices. The rules have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and have been promulgated and implemented by the office. From now on, listed stocks will undergo strict review, providing protection for stock market investors. Furthermore, due to significant tax evasion in over-the-counter transactions, the office has drafted seven articles of provisional measures for brokers of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to conduct transactions on behalf of clients. These measures have also been submitted to the Ministry for approval and have been ordered to be followed by the exchange and all brokers. The full text of these rules and measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Rules for Reviewing Stock Listings on the Shanghai Securities Exchange</p>
<p>Article 1: Except in special circumstances where the exchange submits a request to the Supervisory Office for approval to be forwarded to the Finance Bureau, all company stock listings shall be handled in accordance with these rules.</p>

<p>Article 3: A company applying for stock listing shall prepare the following main documents and submit them through the exchange to the Supervisory Office for approval before listing: Various registration documents of the company; Balance sheet, profit and loss statement, property inventory, business report, and accounting inspection report; The company's business budget at the time of its establishment and a list of promoters, directors, supervisors, and other important officers; A recent analysis of the number of shareholders and shares, a table of the number of shares held by supervisors, directors, and other important officers, and an estimate of the number of circulating shares.</p>
<p>Article 4: Listed stocks shall be limited to the company's official stocks. Other receipts for stock payments and similar documents shall not be used as substitutes for listing.</p>
<p>Article 5: A company with listed stock shall fill out a table each month to report the company's business status and the number of stock transfers to the exchange for submission to the Supervisory Office for record.</p>
<p>Article 6: When a company with listed stock increases its capital, the stocks of the increased capital shall be approved by the competent authority in accordance with legal procedures and shall also be submitted to the Supervisory Office for approval in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of these rules.</p>
<p>Article 7: In any of the following circumstances, the exchange may submit a request to the Supervisory Office, or the Supervisory Office may directly order the exchange to suspend trading or revoke the listing of a listed stock: When the possibility of free trading of the stock is lost; When the company's internal changes are inconsistent with the original case approved for listing; When the company's business is not thriving, the capital is in deficit, and the market price of the stock falls below the par value. If a company's stock has any of the above circumstances and the company can remedy it in the shortest possible time, it may submit a request to the Supervisory Office for verification to temporarily avoid suspension of trading or revocation of the listing, but if the circumstances are serious and harmful to the public interest, the request shall not be processed.</p>
<p>Article 8: If a stock is listed without review and approval, once discovered, a fine of two to five times the total average value of the listed stock shall be imposed, which shall be borne and paid by the exchange and the listed stock company.

<p>Article 10: The Supervisory Office's approval of stock listings, suspension of stock trading, revocation of stock listings, or punishment of unapproved listed stocks shall be reported to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>

<p>(7) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and shall be the same when amended.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military's Combat Method is to Decimate Enemy Forces: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Battle of Luzon</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the Japanese Naval Attaché to China, recently gave a speech on the war situation, after observing the battle since the enemy US forces invaded Luzon. He pointed out the failure of the enemy's strategy, and stated that the future decisive battle will determine the rise and fall of East Asia. Therefore, the one billion people of East Asia should unite and advance together. The main points of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Five weeks have passed since the enemy US forces began landing in Lingayen Gulf. The enemy's achievements have been limited to dividing the Luzon plain and reaching Manila, a cultural city with no strategic value. They have achieved nothing in terms of decimating the opposing forces. The Japanese army in Luzon is still able to secure strategic locations, and its core troops have not suffered any losses. Therefore, the result of the US military's five weeks of hard fighting is merely a success on the map. In short, there is little value in vying for territory. Only General Yamashita's combat guidance can give us limitless expectations.</p>
<p>The Enemy is Attempting a Last-Ditch Effort</p>
<p>Furthermore, MacArthur has transferred most of his forces to the Luzon area, and is gathering a large army in the Mariana Islands to actively reinforce them. The enemy's aggressive attack on the Philippines is nothing more than a last-ditch effort to penetrate the Japanese line. There are three possibilities for this: first, to invade the Japanese mainland; second, to land on the mainland; and third, to land on the peninsula in Southeast Asia. The enemy hopes to land on the Japanese mainland, but they will encounter strong resistance. The third point, regarding landing on the peninsula in Southeast Asia, i.e., landing in the area from Vietnam to Malaya, to support the anti-Axis forces in Burma, has very little strategic effect. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to land on the Chinese mainland has long been planned, but it will not succeed easily. Even if the enemy has not achieved significant results in the Philippines, they will not succeed in invading the Chinese mainland, which is heavily defended by the China Expeditionary Army and the China Fleet. The enemy will suffer greater losses in the future, and Japan's combat guidance focuses on decimating enemy forces. We, the one billion people of East Asia, should rise up and wash away the humiliation of the past century.</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Enemy's False Propaganda is Gradually Exposed: The Outrageous Illegal Acts of the US Military</h3>
<p>It has been learned from well-informed sources that since the beginning of the war in the Philippines, the United States has frequently used its cunning and false propaganda tactics, claiming to be aiming for national liberation, and making various inducements to the people of the Philippines. They have also publicized: "When the US military entered Luzon, the Philippine people welcomed them with open arms. Especially when landing in Subic Bay, the Philippine people raised the American Star-Spangled Banner to show their welcome, so the landing fleet did not fire a shot. Philippine guerrilla teams are also quite active in various parts of the Philippines." In fact, the enemy US forces are finding the war in the Philippines increasingly difficult, and the cooperation of the Philippine people has not met the enemy US forces' expectations. MacArthur also said: "The Philippine people are helping the United States, but some are also cooperating with Japan. Therefore, the power of the Philippine people's cooperation is common to both Japan and the United States. Therefore, we should not easily trust the welcoming attitude of the Philippine people." We can also learn from another piece of propaganda that they have turned their attention to the local overseas Chinese: "Local overseas Chinese are cooperating in guerrilla warfare, especially the arson in Manila, which was done by the overseas Chinese." However, the enemy US forces previously said that the arson in Manila was done by the Japanese army themselves. A comparison shows the contradiction, and the absurdity of the enemy US propaganda is gradually exposed here.</p>
<p>If the enemy US forces had ideal and good policy guidance in their occupied territories, the unprecedented tragedies in the countries of France and Italy would not have occurred. Taking the cruel situation in Italy after being ravaged by the US military as an example, the people have become beggars and thieves, and prostitutes are everywhere. The mortality rate of infants under one year old is particularly high. The miserable situation of people not being able to make a living and waiting to die should also serve as a warning to those who are immersed in the enemy US propaganda. The contrast between the enemy US propaganda and the reality can be seen from this.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, US troops stationed in Chongqing and Rong committed atrocities against respectable women and hostess singers, engaging in rape, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds. What's more, US troops forcibly abducted women into their cars and gang-raped them to death. US troops on the streets wantonly molested women passing by. All these things make the local people furious. Wu Guozhen, the Foreign Minister of Chongqing, has lodged a serious protest with the United States, but the United States has perfunctorily ignored it. On the one hand, we can attribute this inhumane behavior of the US military to racial discrimination. On the other hand, it can also be seen as a manifestation of the traditional psychological contempt for East Asians, especially the Chinese. Recently, some people in Shanghai still have doubts about the war situation and whether the United States can bring happiness. This concept should be eliminated urgently, and we should strengthen our belief in victory, refuse the landing of the US and British forces on the Chinese mainland, boost our spirits, and fight for the liberation of East Asia.</p>
