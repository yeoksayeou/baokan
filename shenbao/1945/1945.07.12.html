<h3>峇厘巴板全綫激戰　日確保縱深陣地　對集中海岸敵軍猛烈砲擊</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地十一日巾央社化峇厘巴板方面之戰鬥，自八日以來，自市街以至第一飛機塲。長達二十九公里之海岸綫，雙方開始全面接觸，尤以第一飛機場方面之戰鬥極爲猛烈，日軍之突擊，使敵犧牲甚大。現日軍仍確保縱深陣地，對於集合海岸綫狹隘地點之敵軍，以集中砲火猛射，予以莫大損害。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地十一日中央社電　激戰業「週之峇厘巴板戰綫，由於日守備隊之勇敢奮戰，第一綫陣地一帶敵軍屍體縱橫累累。四日以來，日軍藤本少尉所指揮之一隊，對侵攻第二飛行塲之敵戰東集團猛烈砲擊，瞬間毀敵戰車三輛，將敵擊退。戶屋少尉所指揮之一隊，以巨砲擊毀敵觀測所，致敵砲擊逐漸沉默。另一隊配置於一特殊地點，以寡兵抗敵數百，奮戰歷十四小時之久，予敵以重創，將其擊退。日防空部隊，對連日以戰鬥機轟炸機十餘架屢次轟炸掃射日軍陳地之敵機勇敢交戰，提少尉指揮之一隊，至四日止所獲戰果，計擊落B24型機三架，P38型機四架，B25型一架，擊破B24型三架，P38型三架，戰鬥機一架，總計擊落擊破敵機十五架以上。</p>
<h3>日特攻隊果敢出擊今後空戰將趨熾烈</h3>
<p>前機基地十一日中央社電冲繩一役，日軍果敢之特攻，不僅摧毀敵軍侵寇日本本土之計劃，對於今後作戰之進展，亦予以甚大打擊，目前敵花積極準備冲繩之基地羣，更任重於戰術用之中小型機之整備，日軍之特攻攻擊，隨惡劣氣候之北上，益形有利，而全九州及全本土之基地，整備益見加強，故戰勢將有利於日軍，即如某特攻基地，雖遭敵機數十架之襲擊，中彈數處，然於此硝烟未消之中，特攻機仍由基地陸續出動，無論敵方如何轟炸，百折不撓，果敢迎擊，特攻之精神，惟有日益旺盛。敵軍急謀制壓特攻基地，日軍亦果敢迎擊，而日機更猛攻冲繩方面敵基地，是以兩軍之空戰必趨熾烈。按美軍於歐洲戰域曾發動空軍二萬餘架，今後到日本本土展開作戰時，空軍之數量自有限度，而日本之航空機工場，自移於地下後，業向前綫送出特攻機，銀　翩翔於九州基地，以及鮮滿大陸數千公里，日特攻機之存在，則敵之本土侵寇作戰，必陷於流血之困境。</p>
<h3>襲關東艦載機　擊落廿六架</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電美單哈爾賽指揮之第三艦隊所出動之艦載機羣，於十日上午五時餘迄下午五時左右，對日關東地區施行波狀攻擊，其主要目的乃在攻擊日繼塲，雷時先後來襲之敵機’綜計約達千三百架，日軍巧妙迎戰，獲得成功，損害極爲輕微，飛機及機塲設施無損害。又日軍所獲戰果，計擊落敵機二十六架，敵機動部隊於十日攻擊後，深懼日軍之特攻攻擊，似已退避，十一日晨未見艦載機來襲，然其機動部隊似尙游弋於日本土近海</p>
<p>P61型機進駐冲繩</p>
<p>前綫航空基空基地十一日中央社電　現配置於冲繩戰綫之敵戰鬥機及轟炸機羣，各色種型均有，最近偵悉P61型夜間戰鬥機，亦已進駐伊江島，據聞P61型係夜間戰鬥機中之地上襲擊機，具有雙發動機及雙機身，　　二十一米餘，機身長十五米餘，乘員三名，武裝二十密里砲五門，最高速度爲六百五十公里。</p>
<h3>日閣議通過　食糧對策</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日政府爲備敵侵攻本土，現逐次推行決戰施策，十日於閣議中通過「國內化戰場之食糧對策」，十一日由情報局將其要旨發表。</p>
<h3>河合高射砲部隊日陸省授予感狀　擊落敵機共四一二架</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電日陸軍少將河合　統率之高射砲隊，自一月十九日馬里亞納基地B29型大舉來襲阪神要地以來，於接踵之空襲下，獲得赫赫之戰果。三月十三日及十六日夜，雖天氣惡劣，但終克復困難，獲致擊落擊破敵機共達百四十二架之戰果。其次，於六月一日及五日，敵機大規模來襲阪神地區，該部隊長以下各將士，益加發揮其盛力，對來襲之敵機約四百五十架，擊落其三十六架。茲據陸軍省於十一日發表稱：該河合高射砲隊護一衛皇土之大任，堪爲軍人楷模，茲特授與感狀，並奏達上聞。</p>
<h3>滿李大使披歷　對戰爭决意</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　滿洲國駐華大使李紹庚，十一日下午三時半在大使館會見中日記者，就滿洲國一般現狀扼要報吿，幷披瀝對大東亞戰爭之决意與信念，大意謂，歐洲戰爭今已終結，據英美所宣示的大西洋黨早，以及此次召開之舊金山會議而論，敵方固盛言保障各民族之獨立生存，然分析英美等處分戰敗國德意志的苛刻條件，可知強權足以戰勝公理，為了爭取獨立與生存，自當敵愾同仇，這一點，中日滿三國已早聲明，為大東亞共存共熒，而其有作戰的决意。滿洲國民對增强戰力一層，正呈現活潑的進展，以軍需生產言之，由於兵器目給體制的確立，兵器的生產能力遂得整備强化，而積極向充實戰力之途邁進。對與農增產施策，視為重點，本年度在一般農戶增產一成，開拓團增產五成的大月標下，着手推進，一切都很順利進行，當能按預期而得到豐滿的秋收。至于國民勤勞奉公一事，春間曾成產指導統轄最高極關「國民勤勞部」，組織學生動員隊和官史勤勞挺身隊等，對於戰力增强與國防建設兩端，獻力匪淺。地方行政方面一，爲强化調整其綜合的絡，曾發表時局特別措置要　，因此，地區防衛的機能愈益健全，由於統制濟與生活必需品配給一貫的實施，故國民生活至為安定，國民對政府的施策，莫不充分的信賴與協力。前年五月二日，我張國務總理大臣，曾以訪日特派大使資格出使日本，關于日滿一體遂行戰爭之方策，結果意見完全一致，可見日滿的親善關係，全依于道義的立場，較之舊金山會議與會各國之爾詐我處，實不可以同日而語，是以中日滿三國問光榮的保全，適足以奠定大東亞戰爭共戰共勝的基礎。同時，更可以喚起大東亞各國各地域的東亞共同運命，在結集總力使敵人退出于東亞的領域。</p>
<h3>粵褚省長　發表施政方針　—致力建設安定民生—</h3>
<p>廣州十一日中央社電　新任粵省長兼綏署主任褚民誼，於九日上午四時於省府大禮堂，舉行宣誓就職典禮，到省會各機關長官數十人，由陳中委代表中央當局監誓。褚省長就職後，於十時按見本市中外記者，對本省民衆發表談話，大意如次：廣東爲革命策源地，在歷史上有偉大光榮之地位，吾人旣知中國愛革命之歷史，愛國父之三民主義，以及汪先生之和平救國運動，發更應愛廣東。粵省自事變以還，處地偏僻，其經濟狀况·社會環境·交通情况·均極複雜，欲求適合，必須加倍努力。本人此次來粵，當不惜任何犧牲，不避任何艱難，不畏任何險阻，以從事愛護廣東之工作，區區此心，可指天日。至於治粵大計，即以愛護粵省本心，爲施政之標的，適應粵省當前之需要，爲施政之方針。愛護之意義不僅一途，以言社會，則祇許建設，不許破壞，以言民生則許安定，不許動搖，以言經濟則許調整，不許投機，以言市塲，則許　　，不許擾亂，以言農村，則許培植，不許剝削。此外敎育文化民俗習慣軍警工商等事項，應有紀律的强化，不作無意義之擴張，總之，阻止一切破壞即加强一分生命力。至於適應二字，淺義言之，即滿足一切正義的要求，促推一分正常的進展，與民間同甘苦，上述一切即本人愛護廣東之工作過程中應負之職，希全省民衆以此自勵，以匡不逮。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>渝延問題與參政會</h3>
<p>重慶方面最後一次國民參政會議，業於七月七日開幕。這次參政會以後，按照重慶國民黨六全大會的決定，就要於十一月十二日召集全國國民大會，審議通過憲法等，實行「　政於民」的憲政了。但是重慶國民黨道種決定，首先遭遇到中共方面的反擊，議刺渝方這種決定，只是表面文章，所以宣布拒絕參加這次參政會及將在重慶領導下舉行的國民大會。同時，第三勢力對重慶當局頗感焦躁，為着　全國際視聽起見，不能不求這最後一次參政會，造成功德國滿的表面現象，對於中共和第三勢力方面，不得不稍假以顔色。中立派黃炎培氏等六人之訪問延安，其動機就是如此。</p>
<p>在最近幾年來，以參政會的出席問題為契機而露骨化的渝共問題，幾乎每年得舊戲重演一次。其間也免不了挽請第三勢力出來調停遊說，可是，結果往往成為不了之局。渝共的對立或更深一層，而第三勢力也是徒呼負負，發表一些痛哭流涕的文章，促請渝共雙方以國家大局為重，捐棄成見與私謀，國結合作云云，無非是一套老調。</p>
<p>不過，這一次的形勢，顯然是更嚴重了，第一，重慶旣然準備實施憲政，而國內猶如此的對立和磨擦，給國際上留下一個非常劣的印象；第二，歐洲戰爭結束以後，東亞問題提到了最前面，重慶急待聯合國一體加强援助，而聯合國方面則以中國內部的統一團結為前提，渝共問題之　，使重慶之怔忡不安；第三，這次宋子文赴蘇，帶了大批人馬前往，企圖對遠東問題，乘機作全面的接觸，進而參加三　會議，所以渝共問題之表面和解，尤有迫切需要。中立派黃炎培民等之北上，其使命自與以往兩次對共之章的折衝談判，有所差別。</p>
<p>在中立派即第三勢力方面，在民國二十六年事變以前，一度調停國共衝突，確乎有過重大作用。可是事變以後，第三勢力也因國共衝突之一度緩和而失其價值，一部分領袖在參政會議也發揮不了多大作用。直到民國三十年春皖南事變，國共衝突再見嚴重，於是以黃炎培，張君勵，左舜生等為中心的所謂第三勢力，就因調停渝共糾紛而受各方注目，不久即有「民主政團同盟」之設，形成正式的第三勢力。現在，他們欣然北上，除了調停任務之外，自然還有更遠大的理想。</p>
<p>渝共間關係之無法緩和，在此渝共實力對比開始倒轉的變化之時，無法根本解決，這不僅我們所能瞭然，就是重慶的第三勢力方面，未嘗完全看不到。但是，他們之毅然担負調停之責，在全國人心的感召方面，在渝共對他們的尊重方面，都足以提高其地位，這也是可想而知的。延安方面，對黃炎培氏之歡迎禮待有加，就可證明，但是因此就說第三勢力又有影響全國政治的力量，非但言之過早，而且也不符事實的。</p>
<p>在這種僵局之下，重慶的國民參政會雖然照樣舉行，可是其黯然無神，也不足驚奇了。</p>
<h3>吳化文蒞蚌</h3>
<p>蚌埠十一日中央社電　第三方面軍總司令吳化文將軍，頃以該方面軍業經奉合移防本省，昨率各高級將領乘軍蒞蚌，林省長兼綏靖主任以下各應處局長，省會各民衆團體代表，學生，盟邦各機關長官等千餘人到站歡迎，吳總司令下車後，即乘車至綏署拜會林主任，繼分別拜訪盟各機關，旋由林省長設宴洗塵。又該方面軍司令部發表「吿皖省民衆書」，闡明該軍不擾民，眞愛民，誓死救國之革命軍立塲，並希望本省父老深澈瞭解共匪猖　，爲書國家人民，必須軍民合作，嚴密防共，積極剿共，並表示今後決在林綏靖主任指導下，協力政府肅淸匪共，向興華保亞之途邁進。又電，吳總司令十日上午十時，在官邸接見友邦來賓，暢談甚　，直至十二時許始辭去。下午二時，吳總司令往訪省黨部及警衛第二師奏師長，交換意見，四時會見記者，就該軍移防意義及剿共安民之決心闡述　詳，晚應省府各應處局歡宴。又電，吳總司令十上午十時會見黨政軍各機關來賓，交換意見，下午三時復會見商民代表，就今後軍民合作交換意見，頗爲融洽，晚慶省黨部歡宴。</p>
<h3>蘇滬公路　積極修築中</h3>

<h3>開發洞庭西山芻議</h3>
<p>— 徐惠民</p>
<p>自上海各界蘇省觀光團袁履登，項康原，陳日平諸先生前往洞庭西山考察，擬作人口疏散之張本後，西山益引起一般人之注目，江蘇任省長暨孫建設　長，且有開聞爲自治模範區之計劃。爰抒管見，以　一得。</p>
<p>查西山為筆者之故鄉，屬吳縣境，孤縣太湖中，四面環水，山水奔放，幅員遼闊，東接東山，南接浙江湖州，西接無鍚，北接光福。土地面積有：田八九八五。二〇九畝、地二〇○二七·一四六畝，山四二六一七、四八三畝，蕩三八七四·三八三畝，合計爲七五五〇四·二二一畝。居民務農者佔百分之六十五，工佔百之二十，商佔百分之十，其他黨政醫學佔百分之五。全境創一區治，爲吳縣　第十三區，設有區署，保甲組織分二鎭八鄉，七十四保，七百六十一甲。風景之優美，不亞於蘇杭，且蘊藏豐富，有煤，錳，磁土，灰石等　產。菓品有枇把，楊梅，銀杏，栗子等衛品。特產有洞庭碧螺春，爲最佳綠茶，得山川雲霧之氣，味淸而冽，馳名退邇。羊毛亦爲本山特產，品質柔靱，以之織造毛織品，最爲合用。惜敎育幼稚，民智閉塞，類都崇尙迷信，墨字成法，一切不知研究改良，地方行政一度操於嗜好烟賭者之手，致苛捐雜稅，地方日貧，民生日蹙。</p>
<p>確立治安</p>
<p>西山事　前後，常有湖匪出沒，致地方略受騷擾。然遠道傳聞失　，易於增人恐怖心理，當有者因此裏足不前，殊屬憾事。今則省府當局對於治安問題，尤爲注意，除着金山鄉民組織百衛團，充實自衛力量外，並已令縣府方面，擴充縣保安隊實力，以便分隊駐山增防。今後西山治安保障，將日趨鞏固，不獨民衆得安居樂業，而一般企業家，茍能為國族設相，投資開發該山利源，亦可無後顧之憂矣！</p>
<p>西山之地勢，旣四面環水，刖鞏固地方永久治安，尤重於水路盜匪之防禦，擇該山濱湖之要隘，如東面之爾山嘴，南面之石公嘴，西面之衙嘴，北面之渡船嘴等四處，建鞏碉堡與炸火台，派自衛團或保安隊駐防，某他小港河道，無交通上之重要關係者，一律堵塞封鎖，一面淸除當地不良份子，則全區治安確立、各種建設，更易於猛進。</p>
<p>增產食糧</p>
<p>查西山全區，僅有田八九八五·二〇九畝，每畝收成米糧，平均以二石計，年產共計一七九七〇、四「八石，僅可供原有居民二個月餘之食糧，故西山糧食，向自蘇·錫·浙湖等地採辨，以資調濟。故欲解除食糧問題，非標本兼治不可。治標辦法，請政府當局，疏通來源，准許西山商人蘇鄉木賚·光福·東落·香山·無錫·宜興·浙湖等處，採購食糧，爲防止商人操縱　斷，設立合作社二處，平價購賣。治本辦法，則爲增加食糧生產也，將全區之蕩三八七四，三八三畝，以及濱湖之荒地等，開墾塡築爲田，再將公私所有之荒山地開　，播種早稻及雜糧，如豆麥之類，則西山食糧問題無有不可解決者。</p>

<p>查西山　產，蘊藏豐富，東河鎭天王塢，馬城宮，沈家塲，南徐煤田頭，楊家塲，消夏　，涵植，七　山等處，均有豐富之煤。事變前，大王塢煤礦，由碾商羅甘　，以成金煤礦公司名義，呈准實業部給照開採，並為資金關係、與利民公司合辦，訂有契約，日可出煤約四十餘噸，運銷各地，煤質尙佳。事變後，屢經變遷，初爲成金與達磨洋行合辦，縱爲成金與豐隆洋行合辦，現則爲實成煤礦公司單獨開採。沈家塲煤礦，事變前亦爲成金礦區，事變後因種種變遷，現爲包山煤礦公司開採，日可出煤約五十餘噸。其他各處煤礦，尙未開發。前灣鄉渡　產白泥，鹿村鄉元山產生紅泥大泥，梨棠鄉角里產　，其他各山，或產玻璃石，或產石灰石、即靑石，均可作陶器或水泥原料。希望滬市企業家，在此人口疏散之際，投資開採，協助政府，建設新西山。</p>
<p>設立工廠</p>
<p>西山丁業原料極多，如能設立小型工廠，成本旣較都巿為輕，又可解決疏散難民之生活，誠一舉兩得其利。茲將應設立之工廠，分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）罐頭食品工廠—西山菓品出產，有枇把·楊梅·栗子·棗十·柿子石榴·葡萄·橙橘·桃李·梅·杏·櫻桃等類，應有盡有，惜鄉農　守成法，不知研究改良，致大好集品，不能久貯，運銷全國與外洋，着設立罐頭食品工廠，加以製造，裝入　頭，則歷久不壞矣，他如水產有鯉，　，　，　，　，　，　，蝦，　之屬，因地濱太湖，出產繁衍。又有銀魚，白魚，湖蕩中出產之　，藉，　菜之類，更為馳名，均可設廠製造　頭食品也。</p>
<p>（乙）毛織品製造廠—西山居民十之九畜養猪羊，故羊毛亦爲出產之大宗，品質柔靱，歷有客商駐山收賣，運銷外洋，再織造毛織品，運回中國銷售，利益外溢，不可以數計耳！若能在產地設廠自製毛織品，旣減輕成本工資，又可挽回利益也。</p>
<p>（丙）麵粉廠—小麥亦爲西山近年來之大宗出產，大部份居民，以土法自製麵粉，以充食糧，一部份鄉農，都作爲餵猪食料，誠可惜耳！希望滬市資本家投資設立小型麵粉廠，非特成本工資較都巿減輕，且可補助當地之食糧恐慌也。</p>
<p>（丁）絲廠—西山居民，大家小戶，無不育蠶，成爲全區普遍之副業，春秋二季鮮　，最盛時叮收萬担左右，其他鄰近之區如光福·香山·東山等地，育蠶亦爲大宗出產，若設立小型絲廠，製造廠絲，成本工資，均較滬巿為低也。</p>
<p>（戊）紙廠—製紙原料如桑皮·蘆　·竹等，西山亦有相當出產，如虞不敷應用，可向附近浙省長興採辦也。</p>
<p>普及敎育</p>
<p>西山因孤立太湖中，四面環水，故交通工具，惟輪船航船是賴。現蘇州至西山，有輪船二艘開行，一爲定勝公司之山北輪，一爲利興公司之源與輸，每日對開往來一次，但火風時停駛。往來　州、無錫·長興·光福·香山·等處，僅有航船，　不定期。往來東山，每日有渡船一艘。陸上交通工具爲人力車。但因山道崎嶇不平，東南隅尙叮通行，西北方面，則圖　起伏，不便通車，改用小轎矣，西山交通現狀，旣如上述，故要建設新西山，須擴展交通，使其利便，茲略分述之：</p>
<p>航路：（甲）蘇山班：每日至少有二艘輪船往來蘇州西山間，經過橫塘·東垮塘·西垮塘·木凟·胥口。（乙）湖山班：備輪一艘，隔日住返一次。（丙）錫山班：備輪一艘，隔日往返無錫至西山一次。（丁）車山班：備渡輪二艘，每日往返二次。</p>
<p>郵政：西山在事變前，本設有三等郵局一所，係木凟郵局所管轄，事變後改設代辦所，故亟須恢復三等郵局，以利人民郵遞。</p>
<p>電報：西山尙無電報電話之設置，惟爲靈通消息起見，應計劃裝置各鄉鎭對講電話及長途電話各一具。</p>
<p>西山民智閉塞，敎育幼稚，故應屬行強迫敎育。　設立民衆補習學校，通知鄕鎭保甲長，保送十六歲以上，四十歲以下之不識字居民，强迫入校，免去學籍費，時間以上午七時至九時，下午一時至三時爲標準，以免妨礙丁作時間。　改組各鄉鎭現有私熟，爲「奧　　第十三區某某鎭立第×小學校」，將原有　師之不合格者淘汰之，優良者保留之。每鄕鎭至少設立一校，如入學兒童衆多，或鄉界遼關者，可分設二校，然校址須擇各鄉鎭之中心點，免學童　遠，往來不及，學業　受影響。　職業中學之設立，須視地方環境事實需要，再行寬籌經費，尋覓相　校址，籌備進行。　創立圖書館。</p>
<p>創設醫院</p>
<p>事變前之西山，有上海王一事先生等組織之上海　社法會西山分會創設之「西山時疫醫院」，成績甚佳，貧病者受惠無窮。事變後停辦，迄今無醫院之設立，僅該院西醫陸實源，爲地方人士所挽留，掛牌行醫。中醫則有僧醫　峯和尙，國醫王石雲·徐孝實，均主治傷寒婦女內科。世醫秦土元文元昆仲，主治傷寒內科，外科醫生有金仲康·樊子康，然因藥料診金昂貴，居民有疾，均無力延醫診治，希望負責疏散當局，趕速在西山合力創設醫院以救貧病。</p>
<p>建築新村</p>
<p>西山農村組織，散漫異常，為集中力量，易於建設起見，　地位安全適中之處，建築新村或新市塲，以爲建設之模範，（甲）七賢鄉後堡港口至後堡街止，可建築新市場。（乙）東河鎭碩德橋（俗呼渡馬橋）起，至馬成宮止，可建築新村或新市塲。（丙）鎭夏鄉鎭凟橋起至雙塔村止，可建築新市傷。（了）雙塔村起至包山塢止，可建築新村，作爲安全住宅區，希望滬市有資本之建築公司，投資開闢焉。</p>

        <h1>1945.07.12</h1>
<h3>Heavy Fighting on All Fronts in Balikpapan: Japanese Secure Deep Positions and Fiercely Shell Concentrated Enemy Forces on the Coast</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In the fighting around Balikpapan, which has been ongoing since the 8th, both sides have made full contact along the 29-kilometer coastline from the city streets to the first airfield. The fighting is particularly intense around the first airfield. Japanese forces, through their attacks, have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Currently, Japanese forces are maintaining their deep positions and are concentrating artillery fire on enemy troops gathered in the narrow coastal areas, inflicting significant damage.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In the fierce battles raging around Balikpapan, the bodies of enemy soldiers are strewn across the front lines thanks to the brave fighting of the Japanese garrison. Since the 4th, a unit commanded by Lieutenant Fujimoto has fiercely shelled an enemy battle group attacking the second airfield, instantly destroying three enemy tanks and repelling the enemy. A unit commanded by Lieutenant Toya destroyed an enemy observation post with heavy artillery fire, gradually silencing enemy shelling. Another unit, positioned in a special location, defended against hundreds of enemy soldiers with a small number of troops, fighting bravely for 14 hours, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and repelling them. The Japanese air defense forces bravely engaged enemy aircraft, including over a dozen fighters and bombers, which have repeatedly bombed and strafed Japanese positions daily. As of the 4th, a unit commanded by Lieutenant Taka has achieved the following results: shooting down three B24s, four P38s, and one B25; damaging three B24s, three P38s, and one fighter, totaling over fifteen enemy aircraft shot down or damaged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Daring Attacks: Aerial Warfare Expected to Intensify</h3>
<p>Forward Airbase, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese military's daring special attacks not only thwarted the enemy's plans to invade the Japanese mainland but also significantly impacted the progress of future operations. Currently, the enemy is actively preparing the base groups in Okinawa, placing greater emphasis on the maintenance of small- and medium-sized aircraft for tactical use. The Japanese military's special attacks will become more advantageous as the adverse weather moves northward. The bases across Kyushu and the Japanese mainland are being strengthened. Therefore, the war situation will favor the Japanese military. For example, a certain special attack base, despite being attacked by dozens of enemy aircraft and hit in several locations, still managed to launch special attack aircraft one after another amidst the lingering smoke. No matter how much the enemy bombs, the spirit of the special attacks remains undeterred and courageous. The enemy is desperately trying to suppress the special attack bases, while the Japanese military is bravely fighting back, with Japanese aircraft launching fierce attacks on enemy bases in the Okinawa area. Consequently, aerial warfare between the two forces is bound to intensify. It is reported that the U.S. military mobilized over 20,000 aircraft in the European theater. When they deploy to the Japanese mainland, the number of aircraft will naturally be limited. Meanwhile, after relocating to underground facilities, Japan's aircraft factories have been sending special attack aircraft to the front lines. These planes are now soaring over bases in Kyushu and thousands of kilometers into mainland China. The existence of these Japanese special attack aircraft will inevitably plunge the enemy's invasion of the mainland into a bloody quagmire.</p>
<h3>Attacks on Kanto by Carrier-Based Aircraft: Twenty-Six Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): A group of carrier-based aircraft dispatched by the U.S. Third Fleet, commanded by Admiral Halsey, carried out wave-like attacks on the Kanto region of Japan from a little after 5:00 AM to around 5:00 PM on the 10th. Their main objective was to attack Japanese airfields. The enemy aircraft came in successive waves, totaling approximately 1,300. The Japanese military skillfully countered, achieving success and sustaining very minor damage. There was no damage to aircraft or airfield facilities. Furthermore, the Japanese military achieved a victory of shooting down twenty-six enemy aircraft. After the attack on the 10th, the enemy's mobile fleet, deeply fearing Japanese special attacks, appears to have retreated. No carrier-based aircraft attacked on the morning of the 11th, but their mobile fleet seems to still be cruising near the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>P61 Aircraft Deployed to Okinawa</p>
<p>Forward Aviation Base, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The enemy fighters and bombers currently deployed on the Okinawa front include various types. It has recently been discovered that the P61 night fighter has also been deployed to Ie Shima. It is reported that the P61 is a night fighter and ground attack aircraft with twin engines and twin fuselages. It is over 21 meters long, over 15 meters in fuselage length, has a crew of three, is armed with five 20mm cannons, and has a maximum speed of 650 kilometers per hour.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Food Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): In preparation for an enemy invasion of the mainland, the Japanese government is gradually implementing decisive war measures. On the 10th, the Cabinet passed the "Food Countermeasures for Domestic Battlefields," which the Information Bureau announced the gist of on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Kawai Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit Awarded Commendation by Japanese Army Ministry: Total of 412 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The anti-aircraft artillery unit led by Major General Kawai of the Japanese Army has achieved remarkable results since January 19, when B29s from the Mariana base launched large-scale attacks on the key areas of Osaka and Kobe, during successive air raids. On the nights of March 13th and 16th, despite the adverse weather conditions, they overcame the difficulties and achieved a total of 142 enemy aircraft shot down or damaged. Subsequently, on June 1st and 5th, when enemy aircraft launched a large-scale attack on the Osaka-Kobe area, the officers and soldiers of the unit further demonstrated their strength, shooting down 36 of the approximately 450 enemy aircraft. According to an announcement by the Army Ministry on the 11th: The Kawai Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit is fulfilling its great mission of protecting the Imperial Land and is a model for soldiers. Therefore, it is awarded a commendation and reported to the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Ambassador Li Elaborates on Determination for War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Li Shaogeng, the Ambassador of Manchukuo to China, met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the embassy at 3:30 PM on the 11th. He gave a brief report on the general situation in Manchukuo and elaborated on Manchukuo's determination and belief in the Greater East Asia War. The main points were as follows: The European war has now ended. Judging from the Atlantic Charter declared by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the San Francisco Conference held this time, the enemy side is boasting about safeguarding the independence and survival of all nations. However, analyzing the harsh conditions imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States on the defeated country of Germany, it can be seen that might can defeat justice. In order to fight for independence and survival, we must be united in hatred against the enemy. The three countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo have already stated that for the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia, they have the determination to fight. The people of Manchukuo are showing vigorous progress in strengthening their war effort. In terms of military supplies production, due to the establishment of a self-sufficiency system for weapons, the production capacity of weapons has been improved and strengthened, and we are actively moving towards enriching our war effort. Regarding agricultural production measures, we regard it as a key focus. This year, we are working towards the major goal of increasing production by 10% for general farming households and 50% for development groups, and everything is progressing smoothly, and we will be able to obtain a bountiful harvest as expected. As for the matter of national industrious service, the "National Labor Department," which is the highest-level organization responsible for production guidance and management, was established in the spring, and student mobilization teams and official labor volunteer teams were organized, contributing greatly to both war effort enhancement and national defense construction. Regarding local administration, in order to strengthen and adjust its comprehensive network, "Special Measures for the Current Situation" were announced. As a result, the function of regional defense is becoming healthier. Due to the consistent implementation of controlled economy and the allocation of essential goods, the lives of the people are very stable. The people fully trust and cooperate with the government's policies. On May 2nd of the year before last, my Premier Zhang Guo, with the qualification of special envoy to Japan, visited Japan, and as a result, the opinions on the strategy of Japan and Manchukuo working together to carry out the war were completely consistent. It can be seen that the friendly relations between Japan and Manchukuo are entirely based on a moral standpoint, which cannot be compared to the deceit and mutual exploitation of the countries participating in the San Francisco Conference. Therefore, the glorious preservation of China, Japan, and Manchukuo is sufficient to lay the foundation for the joint victory in the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, it can awaken the common destiny of East Asia for all countries and regions in Greater East Asia, and gather total strength to make the enemy withdraw from the territory of East Asia.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Governor Chu Announces Policy Guidelines: Focusing on Building Stability and People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Chu Minyi, the newly appointed Governor of Guangdong Province and concurrently Director of the Pacification Headquarters, held an inauguration ceremony at the provincial government auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Dozens of heads of various agencies in the provincial capital attended, and Central Committee member Chen acted as the representative of the central authorities to supervise the oath. After taking office, Governor Chu met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the city at 10:00 AM and delivered a speech to the people of the province, the main points of which are as follows: Guangdong is the source of the revolution and has a great and glorious position in history. We already know the history of China's love of revolution, the Three Principles of the People of the Father of the Nation, and Mr. Wang's peace-saving movement, so we should love Guangdong even more. Since the incident, Guangdong Province has been in a remote location, and its economic situation, social environment, and transportation situation are extremely complex. In order to adapt to these, we must make twice the effort. I have come to Guangdong this time and will spare no sacrifice, avoid no difficulties, and fear no dangers in order to engage in the work of loving and protecting Guangdong. I can point to the heavens and the sun to prove this. As for the grand plan to govern Guangdong, I will take the original intention of loving and protecting Guangdong Province as the goal of my administration and adapt to the current needs of Guangdong Province as the guideline of my administration. The meaning of love and protection is not just one way. In terms of society, we only allow construction and do not allow destruction. In terms of people's livelihood, we allow stability and do not allow shaking. In terms of the economy, we allow adjustment and do not allow speculation. In terms of the market, we allow   , and do not allow disturbance. In terms of the countryside, we allow cultivation and do not allow exploitation. In addition, matters such as education, culture, customs, military police, and industry and commerce should be strengthened with discipline, and no meaningless expansion should be made. In short, preventing all destruction is equivalent to strengthening one point of vitality. As for the word "adaptation," in simple terms, it means satisfying all just demands and promoting one point of normal progress, sharing joys and sorrows with the people. All of the above are the duties that I should bear in the course of loving and protecting Guangdong. I hope that all the people of the province will use this to encourage themselves and to correct my shortcomings.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Chongqing-Yan'an Problem and the Political Council</h3>
<p>The last session of the National Political Council in Chongqing opened on July 7th. After this session, according to the decision of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Chongqing, the National Assembly will be convened on November 12th to deliberate and pass the constitution, etc., and implement the constitutional government of "returning power to the people." However, this decision by the Chongqing Kuomintang was first met with a counterattack from the CCP. The latter criticized the Chongqing decision as merely a superficial exercise and announced that it would refuse to participate in this session of the Political Council and the National Assembly to be held under the leadership of Chongqing. At the same time, the Third Force felt quite anxious about the Chongqing authorities. In order to take into full account international attention, they had to seek to create a superficially satisfactory phenomenon for this last session of the Political Council, and had to treat the CCP and the Third Force with some pretense of courtesy. The visit to Yan'an by the neutral party Huang Yanpei and six others was motivated by this.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chongqing-CCP problem, which has become blatant on the occasion of the issue of attendance at the Political Council, is almost a recurring drama every year. In the meantime, it is inevitable that the Third Force will be invited to mediate and lobby, but the result often becomes an inconclusive situation. The opposition between Chongqing and the CCP becomes even deeper, and the Third Force simply sighs in vain, publishing some tearful articles urging the Chongqing and CCP parties to put the overall situation of the country first, abandon prejudices and personal plots, and unite in cooperation, etc., which is nothing more than a set of old tunes.</p>
<p>However, this time the situation is clearly more serious. First, since Chongqing is preparing to implement constitutional government, while the country is still facing such opposition and friction, it leaves a very bad impression on the international community. Second, after the end of the European war, the East Asian problem has been brought to the forefront, and Chongqing urgently needs the United Nations to strengthen its assistance as a whole, while the United Nations takes the internal unity and solidarity of China as a prerequisite. The   of the Chongqing-CCP problem has made Chongqing anxious. Third, this time, Song Ziwen went to the Soviet Union, taking a large number of people with him, in an attempt to make comprehensive contact with the Far East problem and then participate in the Three  conference. Therefore, the superficial reconciliation of the Chongqing-CCP problem is particularly urgent. The mission of the neutral party Huang Yanpei and others in the north is different from the previous two chapters of negotiations with the CCP.</p>
<p>In the neutral faction, that is, the Third Force, before the incident in 1937, mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the CCP did have a significant effect. However, after the incident, the Third Force also lost its value due to the temporary easing of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the CCP. A section of leaders could not play much of a role in the Political Council either. Until the Anhui Incident in the spring of 1941, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the CCP became serious again. Thus, the so-called Third Force, centered on Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, etc., attracted attention from all sides due to mediating the dispute between Chongqing and the CCP, and soon the "Democratic League of Political Groups" was established, forming a formal Third Force. Now, they are happily going north, and besides the task of mediation, they naturally have even greater ideals.</p>
<p>The inability to ease the relationship between Chongqing and the CCP, at a time when the relative strengths of Chongqing and the CCP are beginning to reverse, cannot be fundamentally resolved. Not only can we understand this, but the Third Force in Chongqing has not completely failed to see it either. However, their resolute assumption of the responsibility of mediation, in terms of the appeal to the hearts of the people across the country and the respect of Chongqing and the CCP for them, is enough to enhance their status, which is also conceivable. The warm welcome that Yan'an gave to Mr. Huang Yanpei proves this, but to say that the Third Force has the power to influence national politics again is not only premature but also does not conform to the facts.</p>
<p>Under this deadlock, although the National Political Council in Chongqing is held as usual, it is not surprising that it is bleak and lackluster.</p>
<h3>Wu Huawen Visits Bengbu</h3>
<p>Bengbu, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch): General Wu Huawen, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, recently transferred his Route Army to this province. Yesterday, he led his senior generals to Bengbu by military train. Governor Lin and concurrently Pacification Director, as well as heads of various departments and bureaus, representatives of various people's organizations in the provincial capital, students, and heads of various Allied agencies, totaling more than a thousand people, went to the station to welcome him. After General Wu got off the train, he went to the Pacification Headquarters by car to pay a visit to Director Lin, followed by visits to various Allied agencies. Subsequently, Governor Lin hosted a banquet. In addition, the headquarters of the Route Army published a "Letter to the People of Anhui Province," expounding the revolutionary army's stance of not disturbing the people, truly loving the people, and vowing to save the country. It also hopes that the elders of this province will deeply understand the rampant bandits and communists. For the sake of the country and the people, military and civilians must cooperate, strictly prevent communism, and actively suppress communism, and express that in the future, under the guidance of Director Lin, they will work together with the government to eliminate bandits and communists and move towards the path of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. In addition, General Wu met with foreign guests at his official residence at 10:00 AM on the 10th and had a pleasant chat until around 12:00 PM.

The department has now joined forces with the Xuzhou Municipal Government to organize a summer labor service training camp, which is scheduled to recruit 500 middle school students who have not yet entered factories and senior primary school students. The camp site is planned to be at the Municipal Girls' Middle School. Military supplies manufactured by various factories that belong to the light industry and manual labor sectors will be sent to the training camp for production. The factory side will also send personnel to guide the work. Currently, more than 400 people have registered, and it is scheduled to begin on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Tentative Proposals for Developing West Dongting Mountain</h3>
<p>— Xu Huimin</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai community's Jiangsu Province sightseeing delegation, including Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Xiang Kangyuan, and Chen Riping, went to West Dongting Mountain for inspection, intending to use it as a basis for population dispersal, West Mountain has increasingly attracted public attention. The Jiangsu Provincial Governor and Sun Jianshe, the head, also have a plan to open it as a model autonomous region. Therefore, I express my humble opinion as a small contribution.</p>
<p>West Mountain is my hometown, located in Wu County, a lone island in Taihu Lake, surrounded by water on all sides, with unrestrained mountains and waters and a vast area. It is adjacent to East Mountain in the east, Huzhou, Zhejiang in the south, Wuxi in the west, and Guangfu in the north. The land area includes: 8985.209 acres of rice paddies, 20027.146 acres of land, 42617.483 acres of mountains, and 3874.383 acres of swamps, totaling 75504.221 acres. Residents engaged in agriculture account for 65%, industry 20%, commerce 10%, and other party affairs, politics, medicine 5%. The entire area is established as a district under the jurisdiction of Wu County, the 13th district, with a district office. The Baojia system is divided into two towns and eight townships, 74 Bao, and 761 Jia. The scenery is as beautiful as Suzhou and Hangzhou, and it is rich in resources, including coal, manganese, magnetic soil, and limestone. The fruits include loquats, bayberries, ginkgo, and chestnuts. The special product is Dongting Biluochun, the best green tea, benefiting from the mountain's clouds and mist, with a clear and crisp taste, famous far and wide. Wool is also a special product of this mountain, with a soft and resilient quality, most suitable for weaving woolen products. Unfortunately, education is underdeveloped, the people are ignorant, generally worship superstition, rigidly adhere to old methods, and do not know how to research and improve. Local administration was once controlled by those addicted to smoking and gambling, resulting in exorbitant taxes, local poverty, and the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Establishing Security</p>
<p>After the incidents in West Mountain, lake bandits often appeared, causing slight disturbances in the area. However, distant rumors are often exaggerated, easily increasing people's fear, causing some to hesitate to go there, which is regrettable. Now, the provincial government is paying particular attention to the issue of security. In addition to instructing the villagers of Jinshan Township to organize a hundred-man guard group to strengthen their self-defense force, it has also ordered the county government to expand the strength of the county security team to send detachments to the mountain to increase defense. In the future, the security guarantee of West Mountain will become increasingly solid. Not only will the people be able to live and work in peace, but entrepreneurs, if they can consider the nation and the people, and invest in developing the resources of the mountain, can also have no worries.</p>
<p>The terrain of West Mountain is surrounded by water on all sides, so consolidating permanent local security is especially important for defending against water bandits. Select the strategic passes on the lake shore of the mountain, such as Ershan Mouth in the east, Shigong Mouth in the south, Ya Mouth in the west, and D渡船 Mouth in the north, to build solid bunkers and fire platforms, and station self-defense groups or security teams. Other small ports and rivers, without important transportation connections, should be completely blocked and sealed off. At the same time, local undesirable elements should be cleared, then the security of the entire area will be established, and various construction projects will be easier to advance rapidly.</p>
<p>Increasing Food Production</p>
<p>The entire West Mountain area has only 8985.209 acres of rice paddies. The average yield per acre is estimated at two shi of rice, with an annual output of 17970.48 shi, which can only supply the original residents with food for a little over two months. Therefore, West Mountain's food has always been procured from Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhejiang, and Huzhou to make adjustments. Therefore, to solve the food problem, both temporary and fundamental solutions are needed. For temporary measures, please ask the government authorities to facilitate the sourcing of supplies, allowing West Mountain merchants to purchase food from Suzhou, Xiangshan, Wuxi, Yixing, Zhejiang, and Huzhou. To prevent merchants from manipulating prices, establish two cooperatives for purchasing and selling at fair prices. The fundamental solution is to increase food production. Reclaim and fill the entire area of 3874.383 acres of swamps and the wasteland along the lake to create fields. Then, cultivate the public and private barren mountain land, sow early rice and miscellaneous grains, such as beans and wheat, then the West Mountain food problem can be solved.</p>
<p>Developing Mineral Resources</p>
<p>West Mountain is rich in mineral resources. Tianwangwu, Macheng Palace, Shenjiachang in Donghe Town, Nanxu Meitiantou, Yangjiachang, Xiaoxiapu, Hanzhi, and Qilishan all have abundant coal resources. Before the incident, the Da Wangwu Coal Mine was approved by the Ministry of Industry for mining under the name of Chengjin Coal Mine Company, owned by the mill owner Luo Gan, and jointly operated with Limin Company due to capital relations, with a contract to produce about 40 tons of coal per day, which was transported and sold to various places, and the coal quality was good. After the incident, it went through several changes, first jointly operated by Chengjin and Dharma Foreign Firm, then jointly operated by Chengjin and Fenglong Foreign Firm, and now it is solely mined by Shicheng Coal Mine Company. Shenjiachang Coal Mine was also a Chengjin mining area before the incident. After the incident, due to various changes, it is now mined by Baoshan Coal Mine Company, with a daily output of about 50 tons of coal. Other coal mines have not yet been developed. The Du渡口 of Qianwan Township produces white clay, Yuanshan of Lucun Township produces red mud and large mud, and Jiaoli of Litang Township produces . Other mountains produce glass stone or limestone, namely Qingshi, which can be used as raw materials for pottery or cement. It is hoped that Shanghai entrepreneurs will invest in mining during this time of population dispersal, assist the government, and build a new West Mountain.</p>
<p>Establishing Factories</p>
<p>West Mountain has many raw materials for industry. If small factories can be established, the costs will be lighter than in the city, and the livelihoods of dispersed refugees can be solved, which is a win-win situation. The factories that should be established are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Canned Food Factory — West Mountain produces a wide variety of fruits, including loquats, bayberries, chestnuts, dates, persimmons, pomegranates, grapes, oranges, peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, etc. Unfortunately, the local farmers stick to old methods and do not know how to research and improve, so the excellent products cannot be stored for a long time or transported and sold throughout the country and overseas. If a canned food factory is established for processing and packaging, they can be preserved for a long time. Other aquatic products include carp, crucian carp, , , , , shrimp, , etc. Due to its location on Taihu Lake, production is abundant. There are also silver fish, white fish, and , , and vegetables produced in the lake and swamp, which are even more famous and can be used to set up factories to manufacture canned food.</p>
<p>(B) Woolen Fabric Manufacturing Factory — Nine out of ten residents of West Mountain raise pigs and sheep, so wool is also a major product, with a soft and resilient quality. Merchants have long stationed on the mountain to collect and sell it overseas, and then weave woolen products to be transported back to China for sale, with profits flowing outward, which is immeasurable! If a factory can be established in the production area to manufacture woolen products, it can reduce costs and wages and recover profits.</p>
<p>(C) Flour Mill — Wheat has also been a major product of West Mountain in recent years. Most residents make flour by earthen methods to supplement their food supply. Some farmers use it as pig feed, which is a pity! It is hoped that Shanghai capitalists will invest in establishing small flour mills. Not only will the costs and wages be lower than in the city, but it can also alleviate the local food shortage.</p>
<p>(D) Silk Factory — West Mountain residents, large and small, all raise silkworms, which has become a common side business throughout the area. In the spring and autumn seasons, fresh cocoons are abundant. At the peak, about 10,000 dan can be collected. In other neighboring areas such as Guangfu, Xiangshan, and East Mountain, silkworm rearing is also a major product. If small silk factories are established to manufacture factory silk, the costs and wages will be lower than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(E) Paper Mill — West Mountain also has considerable production of raw materials for papermaking, such as mulberry bark, reeds, and bamboo. If it is not enough, it can be purchased from Changxing in nearby Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Popularizing Education</p>
<p>West Mountain is isolated in Taihu Lake, surrounded by water, so transportation depends on steamships and sailing ships. Currently, there are two steamships running between Suzhou and West Mountain, one is the Shanbei Wheel of Dingsheng Company and the other is the Yuanyushu of Lixing Company, making one round trip each day, but they are suspended during typhoons. There are only sailing ships to and from 州, Wuxi, Changxing, Guangfu, Xiangshan, etc., and they are not scheduled. There is one ferry to and from East Mountain every day. Land transportation is by rickshaw. However, because the mountain roads are rugged and uneven, only the southeast corner is passable. The northwest side is undulating, making it inconvenient for vehicles, so sedan chairs are used. The current transportation situation in West Mountain is as described above, so to build a new West Mountain, transportation must be expanded to make it convenient. Here is a brief description:</p>
<p>Sea Routes: (A) Su Shan Route: At least two steamships should travel between Suzhou and West Mountain every day, passing through Hengtang, Dongkuatang, Xikuatang, Mudu, and Xukou. (B) Hu Shan Route: Prepare one steamship for round trip every other day. (C) Xi Shan Route: Prepare one steamship for round trip between Wuxi and West Mountain every other day. (D) Che Shan Route: Prepare two ferries for two round trips per day.</p>
<p>Postal Service: West Mountain originally had a third-class post office before the incident, which was under the jurisdiction of the Mudu Post Office. After the incident, it was changed to an agency, so it is urgent to restore the third-class post office to facilitate people's postal services.</p>
<p>Telegram: West Mountain does not yet have telegram or telephone installations. However, to facilitate the circulation of news, it is planned to install a radio telephone and a long-distance telephone in each township.</p>
<p>The people of West Mountain are ignorant and education is underdeveloped, so compulsory education should be implemented. Establish adult literacy schools and notify township heads and Baojia chiefs to send illiterate residents aged 16 to 40 to the school. Tuition fees are waived, and the time is set from 7:00 to 9:00 AM and from 1:00 to 3:00 PM to avoid interfering with working hours. Reorganize the existing private schools in each township into "Wu County 13th District XX Town Standing No. × Elementary School", eliminate unqualified teachers from the original schools, and retain the excellent ones. Establish at least one school in each township. If there are many children enrolled or the township boundaries are remote, two schools can be established. However, the school site must be selected at the central point of each township to avoid students traveling too far, arriving late, and their studies being affected. The establishment of vocational high schools must be based on the needs of the local environment and then raise funds and find suitable school sites to prepare for implementation. Establish a library.</p>
<p>Establishing a Hospital</p>
<p>Before the incident, West Mountain had a "West Mountain Epidemic Hospital" established by the Shanghai Zhishe Legal Association West Mountain Branch organized by Mr. Wang Yishi and others from Shanghai, with excellent results, benefiting the poor and sick immensely. It was closed after the incident, and no hospital has been established since then. Only the Western doctor Lu Shiyuan from the hospital was retained by local people and practiced medicine with a license. There are also Buddhist monks Feng and Shang, doctors of traditional Chinese medicine Wang Shiyun and Xu Xiaoshi, who specialize in typhoid fever and internal medicine for women. World doctors Qin Tuyuan, Wenyuan, brothers, specialize in typhoid fever and internal medicine, and surgeons Jin Zhongkang and Fan Zikang. However, because medicines and consultation fees are expensive, residents are unable to afford medical treatment. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for the evacuation will quickly join forces to establish a hospital in West Mountain to save the poor and sick.</p>
<p>Constructing New Villages</p>
<p>The rural organization of West Mountain is extremely scattered. To concentrate forces and facilitate construction, construct new villages or new market towns in safe and suitable locations as a model for construction. (A) From Houbao Port to Houbao Street in Qixian Township, a new market can be built. (B) From Shuode Bridge (commonly known as D渡馬 Bridge) in Donghe Town to Macheng Palace, a new village or market town can be built. (C) From Zhendu Bridge to Shuangta Village in Zhenxia Township, a new market town can be built. (D) From Shuangta Village to Baoshanwu, a new village can be built as a safe residential area. It is hoped that Shanghai construction companies with capital will invest in development.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Political Participation Council — Full of Hidden Reefs</h3>
<p>Beijing, November 11 (Central News Agency) — Huang Yanpei and Zuo Yuesheng, representatives of the "Third Force" who were commissioned by Chiang Kai-shek to visit Yan'an to invite representatives from Yan'an to participate in the National Political Participation Council, were warmly welcomed by Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other Yan'an military and political leaders, as reported by the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency, but ultimately failed to achieve their goals and returned in failure. A Soviet telegram from Chongqing reported that "Their visit to Yan'an was a complete failure, tantamount to reaffirming the non-attendance of Yan'an representatives at the Political Participation Council." In addition, a TASS telegram from Chongqing on the 8th also reported on the first day of the Political Participation Council, saying that most members of the democratic faction stated that they would not participate in the Political Participation Council, and only one representative from the "Third Force" attended. This shows that the meeting encountered hidden reefs from the first day.</p>

<h3>35 Illicit Financial Institutions Penalized with Suspension and Fines - Financial Inspection Department Executes with Approval from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank, having previously observed the occurrence of premiums on cash in the market, had ordered a crackdown. Unexpectedly, the practice of offering discounts on interbank transfer drafts became increasingly rampant in the middle of last month. The public suffered significant losses due to these discounts, which greatly affected financial stability. In order to stabilize the financial situation and eliminate the malpractices of discounted drafts, the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Department dispatched personnel to inspect the daily payment of customer deposits and the issuance of interbank transfer drafts by various financial institutions. After two weeks of inspection, it was discovered that not only were discounts being offered, but some financial institutions were even issuing blank transfer drafts or falsifying accounts to evade reserve requirements. The department reported the inspection results to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Thirty-five banks and money houses that violated the laws strengthening financial institutions were penalized with license revocation, suspension of business, or fines. A summary of the penalized institutions is listed below:</p>
<p>Revocation of Licenses</p>
<p>Yongkang Bank, Yongfeng Bank, Paper Industry Bank, Guanyi Bank, China Jianye Bank (formerly Nanjing Jianhua Bank) - The above five institutions were found to have engaged in issuing blank transfer drafts, issuing unauthorized promissory notes, misappropriating cash, profiteering from discounts, falsifying accounts, and speculative hoarding. Due to the serious nature of these violations, their licenses were revoked in accordance with Article 18 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, and they were ordered to liquidate their assets promptly.</p>
<p>Suspension of Business</p>
<p>Lianhua Bank, Jinde Bank, Danan Bank, Maochang Trust Company, Zhejiang Jianye Bank, Far East Bank, Yongtai Bank, Weiye Bank, Zhejiang Quangong Bank, Changchun Money House, Hengtai Money House - The above eleven institutions were found to have engaged in issuing unauthorized promissory notes and transfer drafts, misappropriating cash, privately offering discounts, falsifying accounts, speculative hoarding, insufficient reserves, and violating the financial industry guidelines. In accordance with Article 18 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, they were ordered to suspend business immediately and improve their internal management before submitting a review request, which must be reported to the Ministry for approval before resuming business.</p>

<h3>Illegal Gold Trading - Determined to be Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau, under orders to levy a special tax on gold, has designated 50 qualified gold trading firms that have registered for business to be responsible for collecting the special tax. It is reported that the daily tax collection performance has been very good. The remaining firms that have registered with the Economic and Financial Bureaus, and have been thoroughly reviewed by the two bureaus, have been completed. These registered firms can be affiliated with the already designated 50 firms to engage in gold trading, but they cannot trade independently. If secret trading or private transactions are discovered, once verified, in addition to detention and fines, the business will be ordered to close and the illegally traded gold will be confiscated. The Finance Bureau has decided to assign dozens of undercover personnel to secretly investigate various firms. These undercover personnel have the authority to make arrests on the spot. To encourage reporting, the bureau has decided to allocate 30% of the confiscated gold as rewards.</p>

<h3>Solicitation Methods for Scholarship Funds - Expectations for Alumni</h3>
<p>All recipients of the newspaper's scholarship fund must have a common belief, which is "Since I have received from society, how shall I repay society?" In a broad sense, this repayment naturally lies in "Doing my best, using what I have learned, to serve society and serve the country." In a narrow sense, it should be recalled that "When I was studying, I was burdened by my family's financial situation. I was cultivated by society, and then I was able to graduate. After graduation, I am able to support myself. I should save money, donate to scholarship funds, and solicit donations from enthusiastic relatives and friends. It is only right to remember the source of the water one drinks."</p>
<p>According to the newspaper's past scholarship recipients, in addition to graduates from senior and junior high schools, there are at least 300 graduates from universities and vocational schools. Some of them work in the city, and some work in other places. In terms of academic disciplines, there are those in science, engineering, chemistry, electricity, commerce, agriculture, and textiles. Although the employment situation has not been precisely counted, it is expected that they are all thriving. Now is the time for everyone to work hard and contribute a little to scholarship work, so that thousands of poor students can receive your grace. With this "metabolic" continuation, the scholarship movement can continue forever!</p>
<p>Old Students Attention: From 8:00 to 10:30 tonight, students in grades 1 and 2 of elementary school and grade 1 of junior high school can bring their old student registration cards to the library to collect application forms. Please do not miss it. -This Office</p>
