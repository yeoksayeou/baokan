<p>〔本報北平十日電〕長春談判如順利，預定空運之國軍，即可於最近之某淸晨凌空前往，現彼等均已磅過體重，躍躍欲飛。至空運瀋陽計劃，業已打銷，蓋目前國軍已抵星姑屯車站，瀋陽燈火瞭然可見，北寗路暢通哈爾濱，即無此必要也。瀋陽張學詩部，已被蘇軍驅退，並曾發生衝突，張部頗有死傷。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕東北接收問題，仍在會商準備階段。行營主任熊式輝現在北平，靜待張嘉　，蔣經國在長春交涉結果，並督飭部屬加强進備工作。東北行營前由長春移北平，現聞已決定向前推進，或將暫設山關海一帶。行營政治陣容亦逐漸加强，政治委員會委員萬福麟，前日已由渝抵平。該會委員尙有餘額，前東北軍耆宿，現退休天津之張作相，或將被邀協助行營工作。</p>
<h3 id="c2">杜聿明請示後　昨自渝飛返平 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據華盛頓十日廣播稱：據可靠消息，中國軍隊決可於數日內開入瀋陽。目前蘇聯軍隊負責一切警衛工作，但於華軍開入後，即行撤退。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十日電〕杜聿明十日晨十時由渝起飛，下午四時半抵平，即謁熊式輝請示，並訪李宗仁·許孝炎，晚間與東北各省留平主席作長時間談話，十一日晨向擬空運長春之官兵訓話後，即逕飛錦州。杜氏稱：國軍現已推進至溝帮子北二十之苗家窩鋪。所有東北接收工作，將悉按中蘇友好條約，依法次第展開。法幣在東北絕對禁止使用，在政府規定之東北流通券未使用前，國軍所用之法幣，無論大票小票，須蓋有印記者方准通用，且蓋印記之法幣，僅限於發給官兵，而每人均以月薪餉爲限，對企圖牟利之非法商人，絕對予以嚴厲禁止。</p>
<p>〔合衆社十日重慶電〕杜聿明將軍本日進謁蔣主席後已飛回錦州。杜氏謂：經普選結果，各縣長已收復六處地區，錦州當地五萬錠之紡織廠及麺粉廠，亦已恢復開工。東北原有日機塲五處，目前均已收復。爲邀奉中樞免徵糧賦通令，當地賦稅已經杜氏下令轄免一年，藉蘇民困。杜氏於上星期五抵此後，曾三度進謁蔣主席，請示東北事宜，伺時並與軍政部長陳誠及行政院長宋子文會晤。渠於離渝前，曾於招待記者席上表示，自三國外長會議宣布召開後，國際情勢已經好轉。是以東北之接收，已較容易。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十日電〕國軍先鋒隊現正在郊外，待命入城。前傳張學良之弟張學詩所部軍隊移入城內「歡迎」國軍，但此輩仍與中共相勾結。</p>
<h3 id="c3">長春談判獲協議　空運若開始旬日可運一師　當地居民正積極準備歡迎 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社記者劉竹舟長春十日電〕此間中蘇要員，關於國軍空運來長，及各部門接收問題之談話，現已圓滿告一段落。張嘉璈蔣經國返此後，曾兩度與馬元帥長談，與蘇軍各部門主管人員，亦有數次接觸。據蔣經國本日告記者：各次會談，均本中蘇友好同盟條約之原則進行。蔣氏今日下午一時，曾陪同昨由平來此之李則芬師長，訪晤蘇地區司令卡洛夫將軍，作友誼之幷會。李師長於本日午前覆勘所部將來之駐地，此等駐地率係居處要衝之高樓大厦。前敵僞所建營房，皆滿眼荒凉，尙待修茸後，始能應用。我空運部隊來此日期，雖未經宣佈，然當地居民，已有預感，刻正積極凖備歡迎。據目前所知，空運一經開始，則一週內，至多十日內，即可運足一師兵力。街頭有刺激性之標語，皆已褪色，歡迎國軍及反刺激性之新標語，則鮮明耀眼。本日此間晴空飛雪，雪花纖細如塵沙，映陽發光。行營歸來人員，於颯颯冷風中御馬軍，得得聲中，市民皆笑面相迎，熱情充溢，頓殺隆冬縮瑟之感。關於行政接收工作，隨時即可展開。據確息：我方將先行接收長春哈爾濱及瀋陽等市，聞現留北平之各省市接收人員，將尅日來長。</p>
<p>〔中央社記者劉竹舟長春九日電〕東北行營人員，現正陸續由平飛返此問，滿炭大樓，又復趨活躍。行營人員，最少時每餐僅開飯一席，現已逐漸增至六席。政經兩委會前住之海上大樓，尙在保管狀態。該樓房屋，上月十七十八十九曾爲雜軍强佔三日。廿日即被蘇軍驅出。目前行營本部及海上大樓，均由蘇軍會同當地警察守衛，此等警察，前曾一度被繳械，現已恢復武裝。市內除蘇軍及警察外，現無任何其他武裝部隊。社會秩序，大體安謐，夜間已不聞槍聲，惟入晚後，仍少行人。長春鐵路通車後，乘客甚擁擠，且有安全感。哈瀋大連等市，現均較此問繁榮。長春鐵路所辦之工業大學，已在哈開課，張嘉敎特派該路人事處處長朱新民，代表前往參加開學禮。路警監督張培哲，定十日赴瀋陽大連，視察四日。隨張嘉璈來長之鐵路人員，均已開始辦公。中蘇員工，相處頗融洽。長春公安局長現爲劉志格，到任不久，工作頗佳。此間報紙五家，均係於最近三週內出版者，內容評論多於報導，轉載多於特寫。</p>
<h3 id="c4">平兩處怪火　機塲與華北日報 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<p>〔本報昆明九日電〕昔日成爲盟軍中心顯呈畸形繁榮之滇海古城，今因美軍他調及外來富戶紛紛還鄕，氣象日見蕭條。着黃卡嘰美兵，幾已絕跡街頭，馳騁通衢間吉普車，亦較减少。原以盟軍為對象之咖啡室，多已改爲茶室或舞廳，機塲附近營房及招待所人去屋空，景象全非。據調查以往美軍最多時雖曾達三萬餘人，今則恐不及一二百人矣。昆市義民還鄕專車，自十一月廿八日起至十二月九日止，共開出三十餘輛，先後輸送義民九〇五人，其中湘籍四二九人，蘇籍一九七人，粵桂籍一〇五人，浙籍六〇人，贛籍一五人，冀·魯·豫·晋·熱及東北九省共六〇人。此外外省籍還鄉客，行者雖已頗不乏人，但因滇越鐵路迄未修復，川滇路等車輛，不敷分配，故離境者究居有限。昆市人口，據市府統計，截至十一月三十日止，共計二十八萬三千四百二十六人，其中女比男多八一八人。至於流動人口，十一月份會經有登記者，爲一萬三千五百四十二人。「還鄕地攤」，邇來漸見减少，其原因大約有五：（一）江南人還鄉交通工具困難；（二）北方人尙覺還鄕無期；（三）收復區物價大漲；（四）昆明天氣漸寒；（五）各公路沿綫，匪警頻仍，且近歲尾，旅客裏足。</p>

<p>〔合衆社重慶十日電〕此間某報載：謀使新疆置於中央政府和平治理下，而與哈薩克族舉行之談判，刻已陷入僵局。哈族代表已離迪化，在過去兩星期中，雙方並未續談。聞哈薩克方面曾向政府代表張治中將軍提出下列要求：（一）所有哈薩克官吏，必須由人民選舉，（二）保障信敎自由，（三）公文中必須使用哈薩克文，（四）書籍中亦須用哈薩克文，（五）本地藝術文化，必須予以充份發展之自由，（六）保障言論與新聞自由，（七）賦稅須有一定限度，（八）貿易必須不受限制，（九）政府必須承認哈薩克國民軍，其司令仍須由哈薩史人担任，（十）哈薩克人必須有參十加省政府之廣大機會，（十一）過去哈薩克人襲擊國軍應負責任之領袖，政府應予寬恕，不予懲罰，（十二）哈薩克戰俘必須予以釋放。據傳，張氏對第九項要求堅決拒絕，其理由爲在中國領土上不能容忍脫離政府而獨立之軍隊。渠堅持哈薩克軍隊必改組爲「保安」隊，司令由政府委任，此項保安隊之人數，須受法律限制。此外據稱張氏又修改其他五項要求。渠謂縣長可能由人民選舉，但高級官吏必須由政府任命，文件書籍須用中文，但准其附有哈薩克文譯本。至於貿易，新疆之國外貿易，應受政府統制，但省內貿易可准其自由。戰俘必須雙方同時交換，據該報載，哈薩克代表認爲張氏之答覆不能滿意，刻已返歸其位於新疆蘇聯邊境之根據地伊犁。</p>

<p>— 余風</p>
<p>在倫敦，可以看出國際間各式各樣人物爲永久和平的奔走努力。外交家，敎育家，都集在倫敦開會，連並沒有眞成爲任何一家的靑年，也不能例外。六千萬靑年的六百名代表，揚着六十三國的國旗，也在這國際會議熱鬧期間，在倫敦薛穆堂，開有史以來最盛大的世界靑年大會。</p>
<p>第一天（十月卅日）在阿爾伯特堂行開幕式，每一國家的代表隨在自己的國旗後面入塲。揚聲器裏一聲「抗戰八年的中國，我們歡迎您們」，掌聲雷動。靑天白日滿地紅旗向前邁進，領導着後面的二十五位代表；二十位男靑年，五位女靑年，代表着六個不同的靑年團體—三民主義靑年團，靑年寫作協會，基督敎學生運動，留英同學會，男女靑年會和延安的解放區靑年協會。</p>
<p>最初，中國方面接到開會通知時爲時已晚，算起時間來，辦手續，等飛機，國內來人已經趕不上。因此由敎育部授權駐英大使館，和中英文化協會駐英代表陳源敎授，委託他們就地物色人才。代表中差不多全部是原來已經在英國的人，只有延安的解放區靑年協會代表陳家康，是特地從美國趕來的。</p>
<p>中國代表在會議第一天，向大會獻錦旗，獻有數萬靑年簽名的記念冊。錦旗上寫着：「發揚靑年團結力量，鞏固世界永久和平。」</p>
<p>大會討論的大題目有：（一）爲自由而戰中的靑年，（二）戰後靑年的需要，（三）國際靑年合作機構。如果前一代因爲合作得不好而引起戰爭，至少，這一代的靑年應該合作，應該互信。義大利派有代表參加，德國也有靑年列席。只有隔岸的日本靑年，未能有機會來一覩全世界靑年這種合作的熱忱。</p>
<p>第一天開幕式結束時，禮堂裏輪流的高唱美英蘇中法五國國歌。大會閉幕選舉時，美英蘇中法五國覇佔了五個主席位子，似乎是，雖然這是一個純潔靑年的集會，也已投上了一些大國小國意識的陰影。其實是在大會和小組會議裏，演說最博得全塲鼓掌暍采的，還是些小國代表。印度的代表彭拉小姐，痛陳印度人民生活之苦，把英國攻擎得體無完膚。她的演說幾次給掌聲打斷。演說完畢下台，團團的給大家包圍。</p>
<p>在殖民地代表的沉痛演說裏，可以眞正的聽到他們靑年心底的呼聲。他們是怎樣的渴望着人家允諾給他們的一切。也許Jamaica一位代表的演說，可以道盡所有殖民地人民的委曲。他說：「我們爲自由民主而戰，犧牲了多少生命，但，我們自身却沒有見到過自由，沒有見到過民主」。</p>
<p>大會裏有各種不同的膚色，各種不同的打扮，中國女代表的旗袍，竟成了一般攝影記者的對象。大會裏幾位自稱「已脫離了壓迫」的外蒙代表，衣彩鮮明，長袍的袖子上滾着闊邊，也是大家注目的中心。</p>
<p>膚色打扮的不同，自是意中事，只令人注目，不令人驚奇。最令人奇怪的，是在這世界靑年大會裏，竟發現了長寗垂胸的代表。留小鬍子的更多。所以倫敦一家報紙，簡直覺得這是一種「奇怪的會議。」（Peculiar　Conference）</p>
<p>大會裏，語言龐雜，英法中俄西五國語言訂爲正式「官話」，凡有報告，都要譯成五種語言。中國代表都能講英語，都能聽英語，爲節省時間計，中國代表自動的請求放棄華語翻譯。但在大會裏，在小組會議裏，還是可以聽到中國的聲音。中國代表團團長陳占祥，一位年靑工程師，演說時劈頭用中國話說「爲節省時間，我直接用英語演講」。接着就掉轉舌頭，用英語演講，把下面聽衆鬧得莫名其妙，不知他在演說以前，咭咭咯咯的說了些什麼，引得哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團最大，蘇聯本國有二十五個，其他連鳥克蘭等算在內，共計有六七十人。他們入塲時最受歡迎，掌聲震動天地，幾乎全部代表起立。本來這大會有左傾之說，聽說保守黨執政時，不讓它在英國開會，工黨上台後才解了禁。</p>
<p>追溯這個會，前身是國際靑年理事會，一九四一年一般流亡在英倫的異國靑年，大概有三十個國家，組成了這國際靑年理事會。他們身在異國，更覺得需要靑年的鼓勵援助和同情。次年十一月，這理事會就召開了一個國際靑年大會，當時因爲交通困難，由在英的各國靑年參加。只有美蘇兩國，由本國遠涉電洋來英出席。在那次大會裏，產生了世界靑年理事會，再由這世界靑年理事會，召開了這次的世界靑年大會，這次大會後選舉理事會，理事會中再選執行委員會。執行委員會中有一位主席，四位副主席，這次選出的主席是法國人，我國代表團團長陳占祥當選爲四副主席之一。決定今後改名爲世界民主靑年協會，（World　Federation　of　Democratic　Youth）會址設在巴黎。</p>
<p>會期共十天，十天裏，靑年代表們也有應酬，但，都是非正式的。沒有客套，沒有排塲，一碟菜，一杯酒，不過表示靑年間交往的赤誠。中國代表每天中午的飯桌上，總有若干異國靑年代表在座。中國菜在國際間久享盛名，一見面，有些代表就會直率的說想吃中國菜。在中國人吃來，倫敦的中國菜，實在已失去了中國味，而在異國人來看，碗碟筷子先已讓他們覺得新奇，豆腐更是見所未見，吃來津津有味。</p>
<p>會塲裏宣傳品多極，每一個代表收到的書籍至少可以放一書架，其中以俄文的爲最多，印刷得最精緻漂亮。會塲四壁，蘇聯張貼的照片也特多。他們是相信「凡事預則立」的原則的，任何國際會議都有充分準備。中國代表匆忙中也寫一本英文的「抗戰中的中國靑年」小冊，中宣部駐英辦事處的五百本「抗戰八年」也救了一下急，至少我們也有了一些可以供人瞭解的材料，發完後還有人來再要。</p>
<p>閉幕那天，在會塲門口，我又收到了最後一張傳單，上面寫着：「會後您們都有家可回，猶太人的家在那裏呢？我們向您們的良心控訴，請帮助我們在巴勒斯坦建立一個猶太家國！一十一月十三日寄自倫敦</p>

<p>諸夏以禮讓立國，爲遠邦所稱誦。古者覘國，先觀其禮，故魯猶秉禮，得以後亡。洎至於今，先輩典型，渺焉無存，人欲所屆，奔同駭獸。浸假一鬨之市，千百爲羣，侮慢盟友，體貌蕩盡，事先檢制不及，事後收攝無從，姑付紀綱節制於不論不議，抑何禮讓之國之無禮不讓一至於斯也！</p>
<p>中國緣何以禮立國？世人罕明其故。請得言之。蓋人之生也，不能無爭，爭則必有亂，亂而懲焉，謚之曰刑。聖人以爲徒刑不可以治人也，思於行爲未著之先，有以疎導而條理之，於是乎禮生。故禮者，刑之對也。國家制禮與刑，事本互爲因果，效在相應消息。孔子日，禮樂不興，則刑罰不中。舍禮言刑，無有是處。古之禮儀三百，咸儀三千，刑亦正刑三百，科條三千。禮者禁人於未然，刑者處之於既犯，理屬一貫，政生兩綱。王充在論衡篇中，叙述明白。禮爲治國要道，其理如此。</p>
<p>自法家起，漸欲薄禮而申刑，然言刑終不可以棄名，故號曰刑名。須知名之所存，非禮無寄。上引孔子禮樂不興刑罰不中之說，即歸本於正名順言。儒法兩家，本來無迕。顧儒家執禮而偏於名，法家尙刑而偏於法，源遠米分，遂成對嚮。亭林有云：漢人以名爲治，故人才盛；今人以法爲治，故人才衰。治道所關，非細故已。</p>
<p>或者禮與義廉恥合言之，謂之四維，其說起於管子。柳宗元曾以爲非管子言，謂廉者不苟得也，恥者羞從非也，是即所謂義，不能與凝抗而爲維。竊謂柳子之釋廉恥，畸於負面，益以禮之制人未然，義之禁民爲非，（本易繫辭下傳，）消極之誼，四者相等。何况管子明著禮不踰節，義不自進，廉不蔽惡，恥不從枉，四不字犁然顯其為反面乎？（見牧民篇。）今之人誤解進步，標尙積極，輕小德之出入，以權利爲性命，四德曠廢，返於原人榛狉搏噬之風。蔣主席有憂之，爰於十年前，創爲新生活運動，重伸齊相之說，期期以右四德爲國是。不謂言者諄諄，聰者藐藐，奉行者不必深通其意，未免　預從事，渙汗大號，視同具文，開國以來，國家所認爲最有意義之條敎，績效之相悖爾爾，可勝浩歎！</p>
<p>或者疑之：四維者二千年以前之陳說也，謂之曰新何故？請得而答之曰：新舊者比較之辭，未含不變之義。人類之聰明才力，古今人相去不遠，社會之文爲施設，亦不能由無生有。歷史之所以可貴，文化之期於不斷，不外以古爲鑑，善善而從其長。今四維之絕也久矣，國之傾危覆滅，息息可慮，獨有人祖述憲軍，重理宿誼，錫以嶄然之幟志，樹爲生事之指針。　世之人自新其所謂新，上之所是，下敢以爲非，廣衆之掌聲，難抵私居之目笑，卒之棄禮絕義寡廉鮮恥之事，層見疊出，辜負維新之大猷，玷辱聖教之古國，其奈之何！</p>
<p>或者又疑之：禮云名云，中土所有，外邦無此，國乃盛强，何吾之不憚煩，必師古以虛名相市爲？則請以英國之事明之。英人以法爲治，而不知名律Law　of　Honour之爲用，尤爲深至。當雷德佐治掌財部時，意大利無綫電發明人馬可尼，將發明權售諸英國。雷德氏本自由黨領袖，先事陰購馬可尼公司股票，以子息充作黨金。國會大譁，羣以名律扼之，雷德氏遂慚恧不復振起。又英人阿馬立，任漢口總領事，在同案中，買入馬氏股票五百鎊，因而免職。名在他邦之可畏也如是。而吾貪凟千百倍而未有己，宜反不以名爲足矜已。</p>
<p>邇者上海收復之後，「重慶人」頗爲時論所詬病。其間酬酢雜者，踵事增華，程監察使中行亦頗以爲言。昔歐陽永叔作五代史，曾大書於冊尾曰：爲官而無所不取，無所不爲，則天下其有不亂者乎！吾不敢謂「重慶人」幾皆達於無所不取無所不爲之一亂階也，惟以禮不明有節，名不明有分繩之，或無不允。偶因近事，輒有所會，發爲狂言，用吿僕夫。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部戰時生產局蘇浙皖特派員張茲　昨語本報記者：敵營紗廠經我方接收後，已次第復工，截至昨日止，轉動紗錠已達二十二萬六千一百零八枚，較未接收前轉動錠數已增加四萬枚。</p>
<p>恢復產量尙需時日</p>
<p>目前因生棉原料缺乏，故紗廠生產一時不易提高，日紗廠全盛時代有紗錠一百三十餘萬枝，若欲將已接收之二十四廠恢復戰前產量，恐需相當時期。關於充實生棉原料，政府已擬有辦法，在短時期內或將有美棉絡續到滬，以便分配各廠，張氏又謂：過去日人在滬經營各工業，以紗廠業規模最大，且與整個日本經銷機構有密切關係，刻已僱用主要日本技術人員五百名，以便增加生產，</p>
<p>各軍工廠改裝復工</p>
<p>關於已接收各廠復工問題，據張氏告記者：各種困難甚多，其主要者如煤斤運輸不能暢通，此外在未接收前之過渡時期，日廠大多自動停工，內部機器有被搬走者，原料亦有走漏。目前主要機器既需修理補充，原料亦需謀得經常來源，其次，大多日機器廠皆係戰時小型軍工廠，此等工廠，皆需改裝後始能復工。茲經濟部已將其中一軍工廠改裝爲洋釘廠，另一廠已改裝爲製造柴油發動機之工廠，此種改裝工作，在目下材料缺乏中，皆非短時期內所能完成。經濟部刻正在複雜情形下，將復工計劃逐步推進，以期最底限度恢復八月十日前生產量。</p>

<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>五六年前我曾讀過一本愛里斯（E．Alice）的『勝利的生活』。著者係美國芝加哥大學敎授，在各處所發表的關於人生修養方面的文字，頗多獨特見解。『勝利的生活』一書，所涉及的問題很多，舉儿敎育·社會·家庭·宗敎·職業等方面，都有闡發。愛氏從心理學的觀點，要據實際社會的情况，提示我們應該如何在多歧的人生旅途上奮鬥，才能達到成功之路。</p>
<p>隨着抗戰勝利的到臨，每個人都感到勝利的興奮和愉快。我們從此可以過大國民獨立自主的生活了，由不自由的生活，轉到光明的勝利的生活，這該是何等値得欣忭鼓舞的事。但是我們的八年堅苦的抗戰難勝得了，我們的國際地位雖提高了，我們還得經過一個比抗戰更要艱巨的建國過程，才算達到最後的目的。</p>
<p>今後我國的國民要迎接這個偉大的時代，要分祖這個艱巨的建國工作，最主要的就是必須充實自己，建設自己，鍊鍛自己，敎育自己，從生活的各方面，爭取勝利和成功，然後才能担當建國的重任。我們要由改進我們日常的生活做起，廓淸一切不良習慣，矯正一切歪曲思想，從而培養高尙的生活理想，建立他全的人生態度。做『大國民』，做『勝利的國民』不是徒有其各的，一定要時時反省自己的生活，檢討自已的生活，看是不是够得上『大國民的生活』，『勝利的生活。』</p>
<p>法國大思想家羅曼羅蘭說：『生活就是戰鬥』。這話確是至理名言。人生實在就是一個大的戰塲，生活在現社會中的人，除非是一個堅韌的自覺的戰士，一定要爲時代的狂瀾所製擊，所淹沒。我們必須以堅强的意志，克服一切生活上的阻力，我們不能和不健全不合理的生活取妥協態度，要以披荊斬棘的精神，克苦堅忍的決心，根除橫阻在我們面前的一切萎靡，腐化，茍安，因循的生活。把生活上的種種毒素消除了，便可以獲得生活上的新在活力，人生的戰塲上也才可以得到勝利。</p>
<p>在這裏，我謹以愛里斯在『勝得的生活』中說過的兩句話，奉獻於全國國民：『懦弱的人永遠困處於生活的陰暗面，能奮鬥育上進的人才能獲得光明的勝利的生活！』</p>

<p>— 勞神</p>
<p>隨着戰爭結束的是各國軍需工業的减產與停頓。美國龐大的飛機工業，也受到同樣的影響，專製B二九巨型機的波音廠產量遂月减削，從一百二十二架减至十架，本月起全部停頓，全廠二萬九千名工人已解僱二萬一千人，陸軍部與海軍部的二百萬萬元訂購合同已被取消。和平時期飛機過剩，新機不再製造，但廠方倒已備足三個月的原料。</p>
<p>專造P三八戰鬥機及P五九噴氣機的洛克漢得廠，也有同樣的情形，現在正計劃改造戰後民用機，今後美國飛機工業的新趨勢，大概向巨型載客機方面發展。洛克漢得廠正計劃製造一種能載一百五十七人的大飛機，陶格拉斯廠也有一種七十七噸的『陶格拉斯DC七』，可載客一〇八人。</p>
<p>美國戰時飛機工業共僱用工人一百廿五萬人，其中一百萬人將遭淘汰，這是一個嚴重的失業問題。現在希望戰後的民用航空事業發達，或許能促推生產。最近美國政府拍賣過剩。飛機五千架，申請者達四萬人之多，可見民衆胃口不弱，預料不久之後私人飛機當如汽車一樣普遍。據估計明年美國飛機工業的貿易額可達十萬萬元，這是不及戰時的十六萬萬，但比戰前巳增加三倍了。</p>

<p>因爲中國在國際地位上，變得重要，於是無論什麼有關於中國的，也都在外國走紅；尤其是美國，至少在某一個時候，凡是中國的，都有銷塲。</p>
<p>作家們也跟着投機起來。在中國呆過的進過的，都來一本中國的什麼。好在不論怎樣寫，至少也可以銷幾萬。林語堂與賽珍珠靠這個起了家，現在別人也在跟着來了。</p>
<p>近來所見到的兩本是；項美麗的『中國與我』；與埃斯克隆的『我的中國太太』。兩本都是無聊的東西，而在美國竟然能久銷不輟。尤其是『中國與我』，從今年年初起，便始終是暢銷書之一。項美麗其人，大槪在香港呆過的，多少與文化界有些來往的，都知道她。文章寫得頗流暢，但是不知道她所說的是否有揑造之處。</p>
<p>埃斯克隆娶的中國太太是仁立地毯公司費家的小姐，燕京的學生。他原籍是丹麥，父親在上海做醫生。這書裏講起他與蔣經國氏的一段糾葛，其寫法無疑是處處爲了生意經。</p>

<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>第二天早上他托故第一個到那客房裏去，如果那個美國人已經不在了，他祗好吿訴花子是將軍的主意。但是他開開了那門以後，立刻看到這事並沒在昨晚發生。枕頭上睡着那蓬鬆的黃髮的頭。他聽得見那安靜的睡熟了的呼吸，就輕輕地將門關上。</p>
<p>他告訴花子說：『他睡着了。他能這樣睡法，就是快好了。』</p>
<p>『我們把他怎麼處置呢？』花子又輕聲地說着她那句老調。</p>
<p>貞雄搖搖頭。他答應道：『一兩天之內，我一定有一個決定。』</p>
<p>不過他想，第二天晚上一定是的了。那天晚括起了風，他聽着被風吹得俯仰不定的樹枝和發出嘯聲的門窗。</p>
<p>花子也醒了。她問道：『我們要不要去將那病人的門窗關上？』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『不，他現在自己也能關了。』</p>
<p>可是第二天早上，那美國人還在那裏。</p>
<p>那麼第三天晚上一定是的了。風已轉成了靜靜的雨，花園裏充滿了簷溜聲和流水聲。貞雄睡得比前兩晚好些，可是聽到了一種碎裂的聲音，他立刻醒來，跳了起來。</p>
<p>花子喊：『什麼？讓我去看看。』小嬰孩被她的聲音吵醒，大哭起來。</p>
<p>可是他拉住了她，不許她動。</p>
<p>她呌道：『貞雄，你怎麽了？』</p>
<p>他喃喃地說：『不要去，不要去！』</p>
<p>的，恐怖傳染給了她，她屛息站着，等待着。祗有靜寂。他們又一同爬回床上去，將小嬰孩睡在他們中間。</p>
<p>但是到了早上，當他開開客房的房門時，那年輕人還在那裏。他很高興，洗好了臉，站在那裏。昨天他借了一把剃鬚刀，已刮了鬚子。今天他的頰上也有了一絲淡淡的血色。</p>
<p>他快樂地說：『我好了。』</p>
<p>貞雄將自己身上的和服朝困倦的身體裏緊。他忽然決定，他不能再過一個這樣的夜晚。他並不顧惜這年輕人的生命。不，祗不過是不値得使自己如此緊張。</p>
<p>貞雄說：『你好了。』他放低了聲音。『你已經很好了，我想如果我今晚將我的小船放在岸他邊船裘預備了糧食和衣被，你也許能將它划到離岸不很遠的那個小島上去。這個鳥離岸如此之近，所以不必設防。在暴風雨的時候，這島就被水淹沒，所以也沒有人住在上面。不過現在並不是暴風雨的季節。你可以住在那裏，等待一隻朝鮮人的漁船經過。他們經過時，離島很近，因爲那裏的水要深好幾呎。』</p>
<p>那年輕人瞪着他，慢慢地領悟過來。他問；『我必須這樣做嗎？』</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army Fully Equipped and Ready to Fly to Changchun, Shenyang Lights Clearly Visible, Northeast Headquarters Determined to Advance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] If the Changchun negotiations proceed smoothly, the National Army scheduled for airlift will depart in the air on some clear morning soon. They have all been weighed and are eager to fly. The plan to airlift to Shenyang has been cancelled because the National Army has already reached Xinggutun Station, the lights of Shenyang are clearly visible, and the Beining Road is open to Harbin, so it is no longer necessary. Zhang Xueshi's troops in Shenyang have been driven back by the Soviet army, and there have been clashes with considerable casualties in Zhang's unit.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] The Northeast takeover issue is still in the stage of consultation and preparation. Director of the Northeast Headquarters, Xiong Shihui, is now in Beiping, quietly awaiting Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo's negotiation results in Changchun and is urging his subordinates to strengthen preparatory work. The Northeast Headquarters was moved from Changchun to Beiping, but it is now heard that it has been decided to advance forward, perhaps temporarily setting up in the Shanhaiguan area. The political lineup of the Northeast Headquarters is also gradually strengthening. Wan Fulin, a member of the Political Committee, arrived in Beiping from Chongqing the day before yesterday. There are still vacancies on the committee. Zhang Zuoxiang, a senior member of the former Northeast Army, now retired in Tianjin, may be invited to assist in the work of the Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e2">After Requesting Instructions from Du Yuming, Flew Back to Beiping from Chongqing Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a Washington broadcast on the 10th: According to reliable sources, Chinese troops are expected to enter Shenyang within a few days. Currently, Soviet troops are responsible for all security work but will withdraw after the Chinese army enters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] Du Yuming took off from Chongqing at 10:00 AM on the 10th and arrived in Beiping at 4:30 PM. He immediately called on Xiong Shihui for instructions and visited Li Zongren and Xu Xiaoyan. In the evening, he had a long discussion with the heads of the northeastern provinces remaining in Beiping. On the morning of the 11th, after addressing the officers and soldiers planning to be airlifted to Changchun, he flew directly to Jinzhou. Du said: The National Army has now advanced to Miaojia Wopu, twenty miles north of Goubangzi. All Northeast takeover work will be carried out in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The legal tender currency is absolutely prohibited in the Northeast. Before the government-stipulated Northeast circulation currency is used, the legal tender used by the National Army, regardless of large or small denominations, must be stamped before it can be used. Moreover, the stamped legal tender is limited to being issued to officers and soldiers and is limited to one month's salary per person. Illegal merchants attempting to profit will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] General Du Yuming flew back to Jinzhou today after calling on Chairman Chiang. Du said: As a result of the general election, county magistrates have been restored in six areas. The 50,000-spindle textile mill and flour mill in Jinzhou have also resumed operations. There were originally five Japanese airfields in the Northeast, all of which have now been recovered. To solicit the Central Government's order to exempt grain taxes, Du ordered that local taxes be waived for one year to relieve the people's hardships. Since arriving here last Friday, Du had three audiences with Chairman Chiang to request instructions on Northeast affairs, and he also met with Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng and President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen. Before leaving Chongqing, he stated at a press reception that the international situation had improved since the Three Foreign Ministers Conference was announced. Therefore, the takeover of the Northeast is easier.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] The vanguard of the National Army is now in the suburbs, awaiting orders to enter the city. It was previously rumored that the troops of Zhang Xueliang's younger brother, Zhang Xueshi, had moved into the city to "welcome" the National Army, but these people are still colluding with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Agreement Reached in Changchun Negotiations, Airlift Could Transport One Division in Ten Days if it Begins, Local Residents Actively Preparing to Welcome <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuozhou, Changchun, 10th Dispatch] Here, the talks between Chinese and Soviet officials regarding the airlift of the National Army to Changchun and the takeover of various departments have now come to a satisfactory conclusion. After Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo returned here, they had long talks with Marshal Malinovskiy twice and also had several contacts with the heads of various Soviet departments. According to Jiang Jingguo, who told reporters today: all the meetings were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. At 1:00 PM today, Jiang accompanied Li Zefen, commander of the division who came here from Beiping yesterday, to visit General Kalov, commander of the Soviet area, for a friendly meeting. Commander Li inspected the future stationing locations of his troops this morning. These stationing locations are mostly high-rise buildings in key locations. The barracks built by the former puppet regime are desolate and need to be repaired before they can be used. Although the date of arrival of our airlifted troops has not been announced, local residents have a premonition and are actively preparing to welcome them. According to current information, once the airlift begins, one division of troops can be transported in a week, or at most ten days. The provocative slogans on the streets have all faded, and the new slogans welcoming the National Army and opposing incitement are bright and eye-catching. Today, the sky here is clear with flying snow, the snowflakes are as fine as dust, reflecting the sunlight. Personnel returning from the headquarters, in the crisp cold wind and the sound of horses' hooves, are greeted with smiling faces and overflowing enthusiasm by the citizens, dispelling the feeling of shrinking from the severe winter. Administrative takeover work can be started at any time. According to reliable information: our side will first take over Changchun, Harbin, and Shenyang and other cities. It is heard that the takeover personnel from various provinces and cities staying in Beiping will come to Changchun soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuozhou, Changchun, 9th Dispatch] Personnel of the Northeast Headquarters are returning here from Beiping one after another, and the Mantan Building is becoming active again. At the lowest point, the Headquarters personnel only had one table of food per meal, but now it has gradually increased to six tables. The Hai Shang Building, where the Political and Economic Committees used to reside, is still under custody. The building was forcibly occupied by miscellaneous troops for three days last month, on the 17th, 18th, and 19th. On the 20th, they were driven out by the Soviet army. Currently, the Headquarters and the Hai Shang Building are guarded by the Soviet army together with the local police. These police were once disarmed, but have now been re-armed. There are no other armed forces in the city except the Soviet army and the police. Social order is generally peaceful, and gunshots are no longer heard at night, but there are still few pedestrians after dark. After the Changchun Railway was opened to traffic, the passengers were very crowded and felt safe. Cities such as Harbin, Shenyang, and Dalian are now more prosperous than here. The Industrial University run by the Changchun Railway has opened classes in Harbin, and Zhang Jia'ao specially sent Zhu Xinmin, director of the personnel department of the Railway, to represent him at the opening ceremony. Zhang Peizhe, the railway police supervisor, is scheduled to go to Shenyang and Dalian on the 10th to inspect for four days. The railway personnel who came to Changchun with Zhang Jia'ao have all started working. Chinese and Soviet employees get along quite harmoniously. The current director of the Changchun Public Security Bureau is Liu Zhige, who has only been in office for a short time, and his work is quite good. There are five newspapers here, all of which were published in the last three weeks. Their content is more commentary than reporting, and more reprinted articles than special features.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] Two major fires occurred here last night, one at the airport in the western suburbs and one at the North China Daily newspaper office. The cause of the fires is unknown. No American personnel at the airport were injured. The military air traffic control personnel on duty escaped moments before the two-story building collapsed. Sophisticated radio equipment for the army and navy, worth over one million US dollars, and various flight records were all destroyed. The fire at the North China Daily started at midnight, about the time the airport fire started. Military and political authorities here are investigating today whether someone committed arson.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, is scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 13th, and then return to the capital to preside over the first meeting of the Executive Yuan after the return of the capital. This meeting is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 18th. The heads of all ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan have now decided to return to Nanjing before the meeting. The former Ministry of Railways, which was decided to be used as the joint office of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, is not sufficient for use. The plan is now being changed, and the agencies that have taken over the former puppet ministries and commissions will use those sites as offices. The Ministries of Transportation, Agriculture and Forestry, and Food, and the Executive Yuan will be located at the former site of the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Social Affairs, the Land Administration, the Water Conservancy Commission, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will be located at the former site of the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, the directors of all departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the personnel returning to the capital have decided to return to Nanjing before the middle of the month. The date of Minister Wang Shijie's return has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The first batch of personnel returning to the capital from various agencies, over 200 people, arrived in Nanjing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) aircraft on the 9th and 10th. The Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Food, and the National Resources Commission had the largest number of personnel. Furthermore, the first batch of 89 UNRRA personnel arriving in Nanjing have all arrived and will work actively with the UNRRA office in Shanghai to carry out relief work in the recovered areas.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Kunming Student Unrest Not Adequately Prevented, Guan Linzheng Requests Punishment, Chairman Chiang Approves Dismissal for Deliberation, Orders Huo Kuizhang to Temporarily Act as Garrison Commander <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] Yunnan Garrison Commander General Guan Linzheng called on Chairman Chiang yesterday, pleaded guilty and resigned, requesting punishment. It is said that he is willing to take full responsibility for the fact that four students were killed in the recent student demonstration due to someone throwing hand grenades.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 9th Dispatch] The confessions of the grenade-throwing criminals from the National Southwestern Associated University (聯大) Normal College and the relevant case files have all been sent to Chongqing and submitted to the highest authorities for review. The legal committee organized by the professors of the National Southwestern Associated University has requested the Garrison Headquarters to transfer the criminals Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi to the local court for public trial because they are not active-duty soldiers. As of the 9th, the students of the National Southwestern Associated University had raised over 15 million yuan for the sacrificed students. When the deceased students were buried on the 9th, the students of the National Southwestern Associated University sent them off with a "silent march," and no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] Yunnan Garrison Commander Guan Linzheng sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang on the 7th to request punishment for the Kunming student unrest, and reported to Chongqing on the 9th. It is now known that Chairman Chiang believes that although the brewing and expansion of this student unrest was instigated by someone, Garrison Commander Guan is responsible for local security and was ultimately inadequate in preventing it, resulting in casualties among the students. He has ordered Guan to be suspended from his post, pending deliberation. Huo Kuizhang has been ordered to temporarily act as the Garrison Commander. The original text of the telegram submitted by Garrison Commander Guan is recorded below: Since the outbreak of the Kunming student unrest, I have been deeply aware that someone is manipulating it, containing a political conspiracy. Therefore, I have been cautious and vigilant at all times, carefully handling the matter in accordance with your instructions, and dare not neglect it. However, the brawl between the Faculty of Arts and Law of the National Southwestern Associated University and the Second General Team of Officers and the tragedy at the National Southwestern Associated University Normal College arose suddenly one day. I have exhausted all kinds of methods to seek stability, arrest the criminals, and comfort the victims. I have spared no effort in doing everything that I should do in my position. Now, the grenade-throwing criminals Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi have both been arrested and publicly interrogated. According to their confessions, they were indeed instigated by the reactionary element Jiang Kai, and the weapon was also given to them by Jiang. The situation is clear, and the student unrest should come to an end. However, the reactionary conspirators will never be satisfied with this and are afraid that they will continue to use young people as tools to achieve their conspiracy to disrupt society and incite people's hearts. As I am responsible for local security, I did not adequately prevent it in advance, resulting in the deaths of four beloved young people and injuries to more than ten. I should bear full responsibility for all of this. I propose that I be dismissed first and punished according to law in order to comfort the hearts of the deceased students and to serve as a warning to those who fail in their duties. I respectfully request your review, Guan Linzheng kowtows.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Yan'an, 9th Dispatch] The Communist Party authorities announced that Zhou Enlai will go to Chongqing "around the 10th of this month" with other Communist Party representatives to the Political Consultative Conference. Zhou also plans to participate in welcoming US Special Envoy Marshall upon his arrival.

<h3 id="e9">Kunming's Atmosphere is Bleak, Returning Home Street Vendors Gradually Decreasing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 9th Dispatch] The ancient city of Dianhai, which was once the center of the Allied forces and showed abnormal prosperity, is now showing a declining atmosphere due to the relocation of American troops and the return of wealthy outsiders. American soldiers in khaki uniforms have almost disappeared from the streets, and the number of jeeps speeding through the main roads has also decreased. Many of the cafes that used to cater to the Allied forces have been converted into teahouses or dance halls. The barracks and reception centers near the airport are empty, and the scene is completely different. According to a survey, at its peak, the number of American troops reached over 30,000, but now it is feared that it is less than 100 or 200. Since November 28th, the special trains for righteous people returning home from Kunming have run a total of 30+ trains, transporting 905 people. Among them, 429 are from Hunan Province, 197 from Jiangsu Province, 105 from Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, 60 from Zhejiang Province, 15 from Jiangxi Province, and 60 from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Rehe, and the nine northeastern provinces. In addition, there are quite a few people from other provinces who are returning home. However, due to the fact that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has not yet been repaired, and the vehicles on the Sichuan-Yunnan Road are not sufficient, the number of people leaving the country is limited. According to statistics from the municipal government, as of November 30th, the population of Kunming City was 283,426, with 818 more women than men. As for the floating population, 13,542 people registered in November. The number of "returning home street vendors" has gradually decreased recently, and the reasons are roughly five: (1) People from the Jiangnan region have difficulty with transportation back home; (2) People from the north still feel that their return home is indefinite; (3) Prices in the recovered areas have risen sharply; (4) The weather in Kunming is getting colder; (5) There are frequent bandit attacks along the various highways, and it is approaching the end of the year, so travelers are reluctant to travel.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Fierce Fighting in Lincheng and Zaozhuang, Part of the Communist Army Encircled the Northeast of Xiangfan, Sui-Bao Railway Continues to be Damaged, Communist Army in Hebei Harasses <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 10th Dispatch] The Communist Army's attacks on the Lincheng and Zaozhuang areas have been extremely fierce, and the National Army is resisting strongly. The Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways are being damaged and repaired almost every day and have not yet been opened to traffic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luohe, 10th Dispatch] (1) 7,000-8,000 Communist troops began to encircle Shuanggou, 45 kilometers northeast of Xiangfan, on the evening of the 7th, and there were still more than 3,000 follow-up troops. (2) On the road from Taiping Town, 60 miles north of Zaoyang, to Yangjia Dang, more than 2,000 Communist troops were found on the 8th, harassing westward and southward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th Dispatch] A fierce artillery battle took place in the suburbs of Guisui City on the morning of the 9th, lasting for an hour before it subsided. The Communist Army has been destroying the railway between Guisui and Baotou in recent days. From Zitah, the first station east of Guisui, to Taobuqi, the destruction has been thorough. Those who heard and saw the sound of the explosions and the intensity of the fire were all heartbroken. In recent days, wealthy households and merchants in eastern Sui have been increasingly killed by the Communist Army. An Yonghu, a wealthy household in Jining County, committed suicide with three members of his family at the same time because all of his family property was confiscated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th Dispatch] The Communist Army in Wenan, Piyi, Guan, Yongqing, Anci, Wuqing, Daxing, Wanping and other counties in central Hebei is now harassing in separate routes. One route seems to be aimed at eastern Hebei, and the other is heading north to Miyun Prefecture, seemingly aimed at Zhangjiakou. Wherever they pass, the people cannot bear the disturbance. Furthermore, it is heard that some Communist soldiers have deeply realized their past mistakes and have surrendered to the National Army with their weapons.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th Dispatch] Xu Huidong, the chairman of the Beiping Party Headquarters, said regarding the handling of traitors' property that the government has long had a plan for dealing with the property of traitors, which will be based on the principles of fairness, openness, and speed. He hoped that what was plundered from the people would be used for the people, so the property of traitors could be transferred to be used as the opening expenses of various factories, so that the factories could be opened as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 10th Dispatch] A local newspaper here reported that negotiations with the Kazakhs aimed at bringing Xinjiang under the peaceful governance of the central government have reached a stalemate. The Kazakh representatives have left Dihua, and there have been no further talks between the two sides in the past two weeks. It is reported that the Kazakh side has made the following demands to General Zhang Zhizhong, the government representative: (1) All Kazakh officials must be elected by the people; (2) Freedom of religion must be guaranteed; (3) Kazakh language must be used in official documents; (4) Kazakh language must also be used in books; (5) Local art and culture must be given full freedom to develop; (6) Freedom of speech and the press must be guaranteed; (7) Taxes must have a certain limit; (8) Trade must be unrestricted; (9) The government must recognize the Kazakh National Army, and its commander must still be a Kazakh; (10) Kazakhs must have broad opportunities to participate in the provincial government; (11) The government should forgive and not punish the leaders responsible for past Kazakh attacks on the National Army; (12) Kazakh prisoners of war must be released. It is said that Zhang firmly rejected the ninth demand, arguing that an independent army detached from the government could not be tolerated on Chinese territory. He insisted that the Kazakh army must be reorganized into a "security" force, and the commander would be appointed by the government. The number of people in this security force must be restricted by law. In addition, it is said that Zhang also revised five other demands. He said that county magistrates could be elected by the people, but senior officials must be appointed by the government. Documents and books must be in Chinese, but they are allowed to have Kazakh translations attached. As for trade, Xinjiang's foreign trade should be controlled by the government, but domestic trade within the province can be allowed to be free. The newspaper reported that the Kazakh representatives were not satisfied with Zhang's reply and have returned to their base in Yili, on the Xinjiang-Soviet border.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Incident Continues, Marshall Postpones Departure, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Draft a Work Summary <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] The new US Ambassador to China, Marshall, was originally scheduled to fly to Chongqing on Saturday night to take office. However, Senator Morse, a member of the Congressional Committee investigating the Pearl Harbor attack, requested to continue questioning him, so Marshall temporarily postponed his departure.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Byrnes told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US policy toward China is to seek China's unification and democracy so that all opposing factions can cooperate sincerely. He also said: "We have long believed, and have constantly stated, that the National Government led by Chairman Chiang is the most satisfactory basis for the development of democracy." He also said that solving this problem "is not easy." On the American side, "vigilance and prudence, patience and self-restraint," and on the Chinese side, leaders of all factions should also have these qualities. General Marshall will go to China to take office as Special Envoy in this atmosphere, and his task will be quite arduous. Even with Marshall's prudence, patience, and self-restraint, the trials he will encounter will probably be unprecedented since he took office as Chief of Staff of the Army. If Marshall can declare China's path to peaceful unification, then his talent as the world's greatest leader, as President Truman called him, will become even more apparent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Washington authorities revealed that the State Department will have the Senate Foreign Relations Committee draft a summary of diplomatic work. It is understood that all review work has been completed, but today's speech has not been included. According to the plan, today's speech is perhaps the last one.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Our London Correspondent: World Youth Congress <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>In London, one can see people of all kinds from the international community striving for lasting peace. Diplomats, educators, are gathered in London for meetings, and even young people who have not truly become part of any one group are no exception. Six hundred representatives of sixty million young people, waving the flags of sixty-three countries, are also holding the largest World Youth Congress in history at the Seymour Hall in London, during this period of lively international conferences.</p>
<p>On the first day (October 30th), the opening ceremony was held at Albert Hall, with representatives of each country following their own flag into the venue. A voice from the loudspeaker said, "We welcome China, who has resisted for eight years," and applause thundered. The flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth advanced, leading the twenty-five representatives behind it: twenty young men and five young women, representing six different youth groups – the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Youth Writers Association, the Christian Student Movement, the Association of Chinese Students in the UK, the Young Men and Women's Association, and the Youth Association of the Liberated Areas of Yan'an.</p>
<p>Initially, when China received the notice of the meeting, it was too late. Calculating the time required for completing formalities and waiting for a plane, people from China would not be able to make it in time. Therefore, the Ministry of Education authorized the Chinese Embassy in the UK and Professor Chen Yuan, the representative of the Sino-British Cultural Association in the UK, to entrust them to find talent locally. Almost all of the representatives were already in the UK, except for Chen Jiakang, the representative of the Youth Association of the Liberated Areas of Yan'an, who specially came from the United States.</p>
<p>On the first day of the meeting, the Chinese representatives presented a banner and a commemorative album signed by tens of thousands of young people to the congress. The banner read: "Promote the power of youth unity, consolidate world lasting peace."</p>
<p>The major topics discussed at the congress were: (1) Youth fighting for freedom, (2) The needs of youth after the war, (3) International youth cooperation organizations. If the previous generation caused war because of poor cooperation, at least this generation of youth should cooperate and trust each other. Italy sent representatives to participate, and Germany also had youth present. Only the Japanese youth across the sea did not have the opportunity to witness the enthusiasm of this cooperation among young people from all over the world.</p>
<p>At the end of the opening ceremony on the first day, the national anthems of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France were sung in turn in the auditorium. During the closing election, the five countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France occupied five chair positions. It seemed that, although this was a gathering of pure youth, it had also cast some shadows of the consciousness of large and small countries. In fact, in the congress and group meetings, the speeches that won the most applause were still those of representatives from small countries. Miss Pengla, the representative from India, painfully recounted the suffering of the Indian people, attacking Britain relentlessly. Her speech was interrupted several times by applause. After finishing her speech and leaving the stage, she was surrounded by everyone.</p>
<p>In the painful speeches of the colonial representatives, one could truly hear the voices from the bottom of their young hearts. They were longing for everything that people had promised them. Perhaps the speech of a representative from Jamaica could express the grievances of all colonial peoples. He said, "We fought for freedom and democracy, sacrificing so many lives, but we ourselves have not seen freedom or democracy."</p>
<p>In the congress, there were various skin colors and various outfits. The cheongsam of the Chinese female representatives became the object of attention for general photographers. Several representatives from Outer Mongolia, who claimed to have "broken free from oppression," were dressed in bright colors, with wide edges rolled on the sleeves of their long robes, and were also the center of attention.</p>
<p>Differences in skin color and attire were naturally expected, only attracting attention and not surprising people. The most surprising thing was that in this World Youth Congress, one actually found representatives with long braids hanging down to their chests. There were even more with small mustaches. So a London newspaper simply felt that this was a "Peculiar Conference."</p>
<p>In the congress, languages were complex. English, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish were designated as official languages, and all reports had to be translated into five languages. The Chinese representatives could all speak and understand English. To save time, the Chinese representatives voluntarily requested to waive Chinese translation. But in the congress, in group meetings, one could still hear the Chinese voice. Chen Zhanxiang, the head of the Chinese delegation, a young engineer, started his speech in Chinese, saying, "To save time, I will speak directly in English." Then he switched tongues and spoke in English, confusing the audience below, who did not know what he was saying before the speech, causing a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>The Soviet delegation was the largest. There were twenty-five from the Soviet Union itself, and including Ukraine and others, there were a total of sixty to seventy people. They were most welcome when they entered the venue, with applause shaking the earth, and almost all the representatives stood up. Originally, there was a saying that this congress was left-leaning. It is said that when the Conservative Party was in power, it did not allow it to be held in the UK. The ban was only lifted after the Labour Party came to power.</p>
<p>Tracing back to this meeting, its predecessor was the International Youth Council. In 1941, a group of exiled foreign youth in Britain, probably from thirty countries, formed this International Youth Council. Being in a foreign country, they felt an even greater need for youth encouragement, assistance, and sympathy. The following year, in November, the council convened an international youth conference, which was attended by youth from various countries in the UK due to transportation difficulties at the time. Only the United States and the Soviet Union sent representatives from their countries to the UK. At that congress, the World Youth Council was established, and this World Youth Council convened this World Youth Congress. After this congress, a council was elected, and the council elected an executive committee. The executive committee had one chairman and four vice-chairmen. The chairman elected this time was French, and Chen Zhanxiang, the head of our delegation, was elected as one of the four vice-chairmen. It was decided that in the future, the name would be changed to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the address would be in Paris.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted for a total of ten days. During these ten days, the youth representatives also had social engagements, but they were informal. There was no formality, no ostentation. A dish of food, a glass of wine, only expressed the sincerity of communication between young people. At the lunch table every day, there were always several foreign youth representatives sitting with the Chinese representatives. Chinese food has long been famous internationally. Upon meeting, some representatives would directly say that they wanted to eat Chinese food. To the Chinese, the Chinese food in London has really lost its Chinese flavor, but to foreigners, the bowls and chopsticks have already made them feel novel, and tofu is even more unseen, and they eat it with relish.</p>
<p>There were a lot of promotional materials at the venue. Each representative received at least enough books to fill a bookshelf, with the most being in Russian, and the most exquisite and beautiful printing. There were also a lot of Soviet photos posted on the four walls of the venue. They believe in the principle of "prepare for all things in advance," and are fully prepared for any international conference. In a hurry, the Chinese representatives also wrote a small English booklet "Chinese Youth in the War of Resistance." The 500 copies of "Eight Years of Resistance" from the Information Department of the Central Committee in the UK also helped a bit. At least we also had some materials that could be used for people to understand. After they were distributed, people even came to ask for more.</p>
<p>On the closing day, at the entrance of the venue, I received one last leaflet, which read: "After the meeting, you all have homes to return to. Where is the home of the Jews? We accuse your conscience, please help us establish a Jewish state in Palestine!" Sent from London on November 13th.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to Washington Radio broadcast on the 10th: Byrnes will fly by special plane to Moscow on Wednesday to participate in the Three-Power Foreign Ministers meeting to be convened on the 15th, to discuss international cooperation issues with Britain and the Soviet Union. Experts on European issues, Balkan issues, and the Director of the Far Eastern Department, Van Der, will accompany him. Whether the United States will compromise with the Soviet Union on the atomic energy issue will depend on the atmosphere of the meeting. Alsop, representing Byrnes, will go to Europe to investigate the political situation in Romania and Bulgaria, which is also significantly related to the future of the meeting. General de Gaulle is scheduled to deliver a radio address on the 10th, stating France's position on the Three-Power Conference. The Iranian Ambassador to the United States will pay a visit to Byrnes, requesting that the United States not take any steps that would undermine the integrity of Iranian territory. There is hope here that the Moscow meeting can conclude in time so that the three foreign ministers can jointly attend the United Nations General Assembly in London.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Senior diplomatic officials here declare that the "____" situation in US-Soviet-British relations will end with the holding of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers meeting. The inability of the three powers to cooperate sincerely has reached the point of harming the effectiveness of the United Nations organization. If the major powers still cannot attend with goodwill and understanding to address their various issues and fulfill their various aspirations, then the United Nations organization will inevitably be reduced to a vent for mutual disputes. The agenda includes: (1) Control of atomic energy, (2) Relations between the major powers in Eastern and Central Europe, (3) Issues concerning the United Nations trusteeship system and joint management of Japan by the United Nations, (4) The United Nations trusteeship system in other places and the same issues already within the United Nations organization.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] According to an announcement by the Bell Telephone Company Research Institute: A new and unique language has been invented, which uses electronic tubes to transform human speech into green text. For the deaf, this is tantamount to regaining hearing. Even for people with normal hearing, reading it is no more difficult than reading a foreign language. The electronic tube also records this text directly on paper for permanent preservation. This electronic tube sound translator can not only depict human speech, but also record musical sounds, noises, bird songs, dialects from various places, and emotions in human voices. When using this device, sound is fed in through a microphone, and green text appears instantly on a small glass screen, appearing as the speaker speaks.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Editorial: Ritual and the New Life <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>China has established itself as a nation founded on ritual propriety and deference, and has been praised by distant lands. In ancient times, when observing a nation, one would first observe its rituals; thus, Lu, by upholding ritual propriety, was able to survive longer. But as it stands now, the exemplary models of our predecessors are nowhere to be found. Human desires prevail, and people run amok like startled beasts. Gradually, a noisy marketplace has formed, with hundreds and thousands gathering in groups, insulting and disrespecting allies, and losing all sense of decency. Prior restraint is impossible, and subsequent containment is unfeasible. Matters of discipline and control are casually dismissed without discussion or consideration. How can a nation of ritual propriety and deference be so lacking in these virtues to such an extent!</p>
<p>Why did China establish itself as a nation based on ritual propriety? Few people understand the reason. Let me explain. People are born with the capacity for contention, and contention inevitably leads to disorder. Disorder is punished, which is called punishment (刑). The sages believed that punishment alone could not govern people. They thought about guiding and regulating behavior before it manifested, and thus ritual (禮) was born. Therefore, ritual is the counterpart of punishment. The state establishes both ritual and punishment, and the two are fundamentally related in cause and effect, with their efficacy depending on mutual influence and adjustment. Confucius said, "If ritual and music do not flourish, then punishments will not be appropriate." To speak of punishment without ritual is nonsensical. In ancient times, there were three hundred major rituals and three thousand minor ones, and there were also three hundred major punishments and three thousand minor laws. Ritual prevents people from doing wrong before it happens, while punishment deals with those who have already transgressed. The principle is consistent, and the government operates on two pillars. Wang Chong explained this clearly in his "Lunheng." Ritual is the key to governing a country, and that is the rationale.</p>
<p>Since the rise of the Legalists, there has been a gradual desire to diminish ritual and emphasize punishment. However, when speaking of punishment, they ultimately could not abandon the name of ritual. It was therefore called "criminal law" (刑名). It must be understood that the existence of a name cannot be divorced from ritual. The saying of Confucius, quoted above, that "if ritual and music do not flourish, punishments will not be appropriate," ultimately returns to the idea of rectifying names and conforming to words. The Confucian and Legalist schools were not originally opposed. However, the Confucians adhered to ritual and leaned towards names, while the Legalists emphasized punishment and leaned towards law. As the sources diverged, they became opposing factions. Gu Yanwu said: "The Han people governed by names, so there were many talented people; today, people govern by law, so there is a decline in talent." This is no small matter related to the way of governance.</p>
<p>Some combine ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame, calling them the Four Cardinal Virtues. This saying originated with Guan Zhong. Liu Zongyuan once argued that this was not said by Guan Zhong, saying that integrity means not seeking ill-gotten gains, and shame means being ashamed of following what is wrong. This is what is called righteousness, and cannot be combined with integrity and shame to form the Four Cardinal Virtues. I believe that Liu Zongyuan's interpretation of integrity and shame is skewed towards the negative. Adding to this the fact that ritual restrains people before they act, and righteousness prohibits people from doing wrong (from the "Commentary on the Appended Phrases" of the Book of Changes), the negative aspects of the four are equal. Moreover, Guan Zhong clearly stated that ritual does not exceed the proper bounds, righteousness does not advance oneself, integrity does not conceal evil, and shame does not follow wrongdoing. Doesn't the clear opposition of these four "not" words make them the opposite? (See the "Pastoral Administration" chapter.) Today, people misunderstand progress, emphasizing the positive, disregarding minor virtues, and valuing rights as if they were life itself. The Four Cardinal Virtues have been abandoned, and we have returned to the primitive ways of savage competition. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is concerned about this. Ten years ago, he initiated the New Life Movement, reiterating the sayings of the minister of Qi, aiming to make the Four Cardinal Virtues the national policy. Unfortunately, the speakers were earnest, but the listeners were indifferent. Those who implemented it did not necessarily understand the meaning deeply, inevitably engaging in perfunctory actions. The grand proclamation was treated as mere paperwork. Since the founding of the nation, the most meaningful teachings the country has recognized have yielded such contradictory results. How lamentable!</p>
<p>Some question: The Four Cardinal Virtues are an outdated theory from two thousand years ago. Why call it "new"? Let me answer: New and old are relative terms, not implying immutability. Human intelligence and abilities have not changed much between ancient and modern people. Social culture and institutions cannot be created from nothing. The reason why history is valuable, and culture is expected to be continuous, is nothing more than using the past as a mirror, and following the good and the strong. Now, the Four Cardinal Virtues have been abandoned for too long. The country's danger of decline and collapse is a matter of grave concern. Only someone who follows the example of the Constitution, re-examining old friendships, and bestowing them with a brand new banner and establishing it as a guiding principle for life and affairs. People in the world renew what they call new themselves. What the authorities approve, the subordinates dare to disapprove. The applause of the masses cannot withstand the mocking eyes of private residences. Finally, abandoning ritual, severing righteousness, lacking integrity, and being without shame are things that happen repeatedly. They betray the great plan of revitalization and disgrace the ancient country of sacred teachings. What can be done about this!</p>
<p>Some also question: Ritual and names are unique to China. Foreign countries do not have these, yet they are prosperous and strong. Why do we not avoid the trouble, but must imitate the ancients and engage in empty talk? Then let me clarify this with the case of England. The British govern by law, but do not understand the use of the law of honor, which is particularly profound. When Lloyd George was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian inventor of wireless telegraphy, sold his invention rights to Britain. Lloyd George, as the leader of the Liberal Party, secretly bought shares in the Marconi company, using his sons to provide party funds. Parliament was in uproar, and the law of honor was used to suppress him. Lloyd George was ashamed and never recovered. Also, the British Amari, as the Consul-General in Hankou, bought £500 worth of Marconi shares in the same case and was dismissed from his post. The fear of reputation in other countries is like this. But we are greedy and corrupt a hundred or a thousand times more and are not content. We should, on the contrary, be proud of our reputation.</p>
<p>Recently, after the recovery of Shanghai, the "Chongqing people" have been criticized by public opinion. Among them, social interactions are complicated, and things are becoming more and more elaborate. Inspector Cheng Zhongxing also spoke about this. In the past, Ouyang Xiu, when writing the History of the Five Dynasties, wrote in large characters at the end of the book: "If officials take everything and do everything, will the world not be in chaos?" I dare not say that the "Chongqing people" are all reaching the point of taking everything and doing everything, leading to chaos. However, if we clarify ritual and have propriety, and clarify names and have distinctions, we can guide them, and it will all be acceptable. I happened to encounter a recent event, and spontaneously had this thought, expressing it in this rant for the servants.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Takeover Procedures Completed: Cotton Mills Resume Work One After Another; American Cotton Distributed to Various Mills After Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Ziyi, special commissioner of the Wartime Production Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, told our newspaper reporter yesterday: After the enemy-operated cotton mills were taken over by our side, they have resumed work one after another. As of yesterday, the number of spinning spindles in operation has reached 226,108, an increase of 40,000 spindles compared to the number in operation before the takeover.</p>
<p>Time Still Needed to Restore Production</p>
<p>At present, due to the lack of raw cotton materials, it is not easy to increase the production of the cotton mills for a while. In the heyday of the Japanese cotton mills, there were more than 1.3 million spindles. If we want to restore the pre-war production volume of the 24 mills that have been taken over, it may take a considerable period of time. Regarding supplementing raw cotton materials, the government has already formulated a plan. In the short term, American cotton may arrive in Shanghai one after another in order to distribute it to various mills. Mr. Zhang also said: In the past, the Japanese operated various industries in Shanghai, with the cotton mill industry being the largest in scale and having close ties with the entire Japanese distribution system. Currently, 500 major Japanese technicians have been hired in order to increase production.</p>
<p>Various Military Factories Converted and Resume Work</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of resuming work in the factories that have been taken over, Mr. Zhang told reporters: There are many difficulties. The main ones are that coal transportation cannot be smooth. In addition, during the transition period before the takeover, most of the Japanese factories automatically stopped work, and internal machines were moved away, and raw materials were leaked. At present, the main machines need to be repaired and supplemented, and a regular source of raw materials needs to be found. Secondly, most of the Japanese machine factories are small wartime military factories. These factories need to be converted before they can resume work. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has converted one of the military factories into a wire nail factory, and another factory has been converted into a factory manufacturing diesel engines. This kind of conversion work cannot be completed in a short period of time given the current lack of materials. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently advancing the resumption plan step by step under complex circumstances in order to restore the production volume before August 10 to the bare minimum.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee held a joint meeting of the review committee members and representatives of various receiving agencies at 3:30 p.m. yesterday in the conference room of the handling bureau. More than 20 representatives from various agencies attended.

<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau made a statement yesterday, stating that the Finance Bureau, in consideration of the hardship of merchants and residents in the recovered areas, has generously stipulated that the starting point for the feast tax is 1,000 yuan. In the past two months, various restaurants have failed to diligently collect the tax on behalf of the government, report and pay it truthfully, and have engaged in loopholes and avoidance, causing some legitimate restaurant merchants to be in a dilemma. After several considerations, the Finance Bureau, in order to take into account the daily diet of ordinary people and to strictly prevent schemes for personal gain and fraud, stipulates that small restaurants and small eateries that specialize in ordinary people's meals will be exempted from the tax in order to alleviate the hardships of the people. The rest will be taxed according to the prescribed tax rate. In this way, ordinary people will not be taxed regardless of how much they eat or drink.</p>

The part in Shanghai was stored in the residence of Liu Hanyi, the owner of Jia Ye Tang. In July of this year, it was suddenly coveted by Zhou Fohai, the "puppet mayor of Shanghai," who sent puppet troops to forcibly seize all the precious books, more than 100 boxes in total, and placed them in the Changming Clock Factory at 419 Jiaozhou Road. Recently, the police station seized them and sealed the books. Mr. Liu is currently trying to negotiate to recover them. It is reported that the Nanxun collection has not suffered much damage due to proper storage. However, the part stored in Suzhou was lost when Suzhou was occupied, which is very regrettable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Navy Department hosted a press conference at 4:00 PM yesterday for the city's press. Director Lin Xiangxin, Navy Acquisition Director Wu Zhennan, and Deputy Director Chen Baofan of the Jiangnan Shipyard reported on the acquisition process. Director Lin's report mainly covered eight points: (1) Most of the warehouses have been handed over to Customs for acquisition. (2) Regarding materials acquired by the military, for proper safekeeping, materials scattered in remote locations were concentrated in the Yangshupu Public Grand Textile Factory warehouse and the Lan Road warehouse. (3) Regarding the transfer of ships, rosters were compiled and submitted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for acquisition. As for foreign ships, the enemy had often altered their names and types, making immediate processing impossible; most have now been reclaimed. (4) For fuel and food consumed by the military, prior to the establishment of the Disposal Bureau, the military made emergency use of supplies, all with documented receipts for settlement. (5) The Navy only received 50 million yuan from Commander-in-Chief He for acquisition expenses, so it was necessary to temporarily use funds designated for urgent disposal of materials. (6) Regarding the disposal of perishable materials such as fresh fish and cured meats, as freezing resources were running out, the Disposal Bureau has been notified for record. (7) Leakage of materials was mainly due to the vastness of the area and limited troop strength, and some warehouses were of a temporary nature, hastily evacuated by the enemy, making security difficult, or were misappropriated by allied forces. (8) In general, the Navy's acquisition procedure involved first acquiring, sealing, and securing, then compiling rosters for inventory. After Director Lin's report, Wu Zhennan and Chen Baofan delivered speeches, clarifying misunderstandings and providing extensive explanations regarding the British recovery of the Union Naval Dockyards.</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Life that Wins <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, I read a book by E. Alice called "The Victorious Life." The author was a professor at the University of Chicago in the United States, and his writings on life cultivation in various places have many unique insights. "The Victorious Life" covers many issues, including child education, society, family, religion, and career. From a psychological point of view, Alice uses the actual social situation to show us how we should strive on the diverse journey of life in order to achieve the road to success.</p>
<p>With the advent of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone feels the excitement and joy of victory. From now on, we can live the independent and autonomous life of a great nation. To transform from an unfree life to a bright and victorious life, is something worth celebrating and inspiring. But our eight years of hard anti-Japanese war was hard won, and although our international status has improved, we still have to go through a nation-building process that is even more difficult than the anti-Japanese war before we can reach the final goal.</p>
<p>In the future, the people of our country must meet this great era and share in this arduous task of nation-building. The most important thing is to enrich themselves, build themselves, refine themselves, educate themselves, and strive for victory and success in all aspects of life. We must start by improving our daily lives, eliminating all bad habits, correcting all distorted ideas, and cultivating lofty ideals for life and establishing a comprehensive attitude towards life. To be a "great national," to be a "victorious national" is not just a mere title. We must constantly reflect on our lives and examine our lives to see if we are worthy of "the life of a great national" and "the life of victory."</p>
<p>The great French thinker Romain Rolland said: "Life is a battle." These words are indeed a profound truth. Life is indeed a big battlefield. People living in today's society, unless they are resilient and conscious warriors, will be struck and submerged by the raging waves of the times. We must overcome all obstacles in life with a strong will. We cannot compromise with unhealthy and unreasonable lives, but must use the spirit of cutting through thorns and the determination of perseverance to eradicate all decadent, corrupt, complacent, and routine lives that stand in our way. Eliminating all the toxins in life can give us new vitality in life, and we can also win on the battlefield of life.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to offer two sentences from Alice in "The Life that Wins" to the people of the whole country: "The weak are always trapped in the dark side of life, only those who strive and progress can obtain a bright and victorious life!"</p>

<p>— Laoshen</p>
<p>What followed the end of the war was the reduction and suspension of military industries in various countries. The United States' massive aircraft industry has also been similarly affected. The production of the Boeing factory, which specializes in the B-29 superfortress, has been reduced month by month, from 122 to 10, and has been completely shut down this month. Of the 29,000 workers in the entire factory, 21,000 have been laid off, and the Army and Navy's contracts for 200 million yuan have been cancelled. During peacetime, there is a surplus of aircraft, and new aircraft are no longer being manufactured, but the factory has stocked enough raw materials for three months.</p>
<p>The Lockheed factory, which specializes in manufacturing P-38 fighter jets and P-59 jet aircraft, is in a similar situation. It is now planning to transform into a post-war civil aircraft manufacturer. The new trend in the American aircraft industry in the future will probably be towards large passenger aircraft. The Lockheed factory is planning to manufacture a large aircraft that can carry 157 people, and the Douglas factory also has a 77-ton "Douglas DC-7" that can carry 108 passengers.</p>
<p>The American wartime aircraft industry employed a total of 1.25 million workers, of which one million will be eliminated. This is a serious unemployment problem. Now it is hoped that the post-war civil aviation industry will develop, which may promote production. Recently, the United States government auctioned off 5,000 surplus aircraft, and there were as many as 40,000 applicants, which shows that the public's appetite is not weak. It is expected that private aircraft will be as common as automobiles in the near future. It is estimated that the trade volume of the American aircraft industry next year may reach 100 million yuan, which is less than the wartime 160 million, but three times more than before the war.</p>

<p>— Weifeng</p>
<p>Two New Books About China</p>
<p>Because China has become important in the international arena, anything related to China is popular abroad, especially in the United States, at least at one time, anything Chinese had a market.</p>
<p>Writers also followed suit to speculate. Anyone who has stayed in or visited China comes up with a book about something Chinese. Fortunately, no matter how it is written, at least tens of thousands of copies can be sold. Lin Yutang and Pearl Buck made a fortune on this, and now others are following suit.</p>
<p>The two books I have seen recently are: Emily Hahn's "China to Me" and Eskelund's "My Chinese Wife." Both are boring things, but they continue to sell well in the United States. Especially "China to Me," which has consistently been one of the bestsellers since the beginning of this year. As for Emily Hahn, anyone who has stayed in Hong Kong and had some contact with the cultural world knows her. Her writing is quite fluent, but it is unknown whether what she says is fabricated.</p>
<p>Eskelund's Chinese wife is Miss Fei from the Jen Li Carpet Company, a student at Yenching University. He is originally from Denmark, and his father is a doctor in Shanghai. The book talks about his entanglement with Chiang Ching-kuo, and the way he writes is undoubtedly for business reasons everywhere.</p>

<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>The next morning he made the excuse to go into the guest room first. If the American was gone, he would simply tell Hana that it was the general's idea. But when he opened the door, he immediately saw that this had not happened last night. The fluffy yellow head was sleeping on the pillow. He could hear the quiet, sound sleep of breathing, so he gently closed the door.</p>
<p>He told Hana, "He's sleeping. The fact that he can sleep like this means he's getting better."</p>
<p>"What do we do with him?" Hana said again in a low voice, her old tune.</p>
<p>Sadao shook his head. He replied, "I will have a decision within a day or two."</p>
<p>But he thought it would definitely be the next night. That night the wind rose, and he listened to the branches of the trees being blown up and down by the wind and the howling of the doors and windows.</p>
<p>Hana was also awake. She asked, "Should we go and close the windows and doors of the patient's room?"</p>
<p>Sadao said, "No, he can close them himself now."</p>
<p>But the next morning, the American was still there.</p>
<p>So it would definitely be the third night. The wind had turned into a quiet rain, and the garden was filled with the sound of dripping eaves and running water. Sadao slept better than the previous two nights, but when he heard a cracking sound, he woke up immediately and jumped up.</p>
<p>Hana shouted, "What? Let me go and see." The little baby was awakened by her voice and began to cry loudly.</p>
<p>But he held her back and would not let her move.</p>
<p>She cried, "Sadao, what's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>He muttered, "Don't go, don't go!"</p>
<p>Indeed, terror infected her, and she stood breathless, waiting. There was only silence. They climbed back into bed together again, and the little baby slept between them.</p>
<p>But in the morning, when he opened the door of the guest room, the young man was still there. He was happy, had washed his face, and was standing there. Yesterday he had borrowed a razor and shaved his beard. Today there was also a faint blush on his cheeks.</p>
<p>He said happily, "I'm better."</p>
<p>Sadao pulled his kimono around his sleepy body. He suddenly decided that he could not spend another night like this. He did not care about the young man's life. No, it was just not worth making himself so nervous.</p>
<p>Sadao said, "You're better." He lowered his voice. "You're already very well. I think if I put my small boat on the shore tonight, prepared food and clothing on board, you might be able to row it to the small island not far from the shore. This bird is so close to the shore that there is no need to defend it. The island is flooded during storms, so no one lives on it. But now is not the storm season. You can live there and wait for a Korean fishing boat to pass by. They pass close to the island because the water there is several feet deep."</p>
<p>The young man stared at him, slowly understanding. He asked, "Must I do this?"</p>

<h3 id="e69">Sharp Drop in the Gold Market <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>More than 80,000 lower than last Saturday; Commodities and Bonds Rebound Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the issue of listing prices for refined gold, there were no clues, and people's hearts were even more timid and fatigued. The general trend was that the majority of speculators became completely one-sided. At the opening, the price immediately dropped from 680,000 to more than 640,000 because the Sichuan Road small money changers' market price for US dollars fell to around 1,000 yuan the previous day, triggering a selling spree. The banks still absorbed some, and after that, a stalemate lasted for a long time, hovering around 650,000. The stockbrokers' bulls were at their wit's end, and continued to liquidate their positions. At noon, the price once fell to 610,000. Various brokerages and money exchange businesses bought in at the low price, and the price rebounded to above 620,000 at noon. However, the vitality had been damaged, and finally it broke through the 600,000 mark. As a result, it plummeted more than 80,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry fell to 67,000, tael silver to 600 yuan, and silver dollars also slightly decreased to around 430. The covert interest rate was still low because the gold market was hopeless and no one needed it, falling to within 10 cents, generally ranging from a maximum of 11 cents to a minimum of 8 cents.</p>
<p>As foreign banks have already reopened, but the news of listing prices has not yet been implemented, the general trend is unfavorable. The free level is likely to continue to be extended. The previous day, which was a Sunday holiday, the buying price of US dollars had been forced to fall to 1,000 yuan in various market outlets. Although it was said that there was a lack of sales due to the holiday, people's hearts were even more shaken by this. At the opening, the price immediately fell to 1,050 yuan, and a large amount of physical goods continued to flow out, with supply exceeding demand. The 1,000 yuan mark was easily broken, and it was even worse in the afternoon, continuing to fall to 970 yuan, and there were still sales. As a result, it fell 120 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars also fell accordingly. As a result, old bills fell 20 yuan, and new bills fell 9 yuan. The buying prices were US$3.3 for British pounds, US$2.3 for Australian pounds, 20 to 25 cents for rupees, and 25 cents for Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Bonds: Yesterday, public bonds were in an unfavorable environment, surrounded by enemies on all sides. Those in the industry sold off first, and scattered investors followed. The opening price in the morning was the highest, and the closing price in the afternoon was the lowest. As a result, it fell 10 yuan to 85 yuan compared to Saturday. The decline was most severe for Class C, and the slightest for Class A and B. Speculators sold heavily, and the price difference was therefore reduced by a lot.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Yesterday, Chinese stocks also plummeted with the general trend, and conditions worsened. However, Mei Ya fell less because relevant parties bought heavily. In addition, they all fell by 15%. Foreign Stocks: Foreign stocks were still suppressed by gold and US dollars, and buying interest was sluggish, falling another 10% or so. However, it was still a sell-off of long positions. Except for Ewo Silk, Brewery, and Paper Industries, the rest were all one-sided selling.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Although the inland rice market was firm yesterday, the source in Shanghai was abundant, and actual sales were sluggish, turning into a weak situation again. White japonica and indica rice both fell by 600-700 yuan, and medium and lower grades fell by 700-800 yuan. As for oil prices, more goods continued to arrive from Qingdao, and sales were sluggish, with prices falling by more than 2,000 yuan. Flour shops were very slack, rebounding slightly by 200 yuan. There was some trading of soybeans by the Ningbo brokers, and the situation was mediocre. Raw peanuts were firmly priced for first-class, but sluggish for second-class. Actual sales of sorghum liquor were sluggish, falling another 1,000 yuan, and transactions were few.</p>
<p>Yarn Market: After falling for five consecutive days last week, yesterday it fell by another 40,000. Although passenger sales were lively, the factories all sold off at the same time. Gold prices were repeatedly reported lower, and at the same time, the raw materials for floral fabrics were frequently declining, making it even more difficult to boost the market.</p>
