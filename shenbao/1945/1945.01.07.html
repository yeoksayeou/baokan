<p>東京六日中央社電　據日機五日偵察之結果，擁有登陸用舟艇百艘內外之敵運輸船團，於機動部隊掩護下，在呂宋島仁牙因灣西方海面出現，又以制式空母十艘內外爲基幹之有力敵運輸船團，正遊弋於巴納島西方海面。此外，敵有力述輸船團，更於尼古落斯島南方西進中，因敵方之新企圖，尤其企圖於呂宋島登陸之故，菲律賓之情勢極吿緊迫，日軍現地部隊，芷警戒敵軍之動向，嚴陣以待。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營于四日發表，以運輸船約三十艘爲基幹之敵船團，由民答那麟海長入蘇魯海，三日晨七時半許，于民答那峨海已遭日軍機神風特攻隊猛襲，敵船被炸沉大型運輸船二艘外，被擊毀驅逐艦一艘，敵雖受此損失，然仍拼命突破日方之狙擊。四日捕曉已侵入桑霍塞　，同時以掩護該船團航空母艦四艘爲基幹之敵機動部隊，四日下午侵入明多羅島右方之巴納島西方海面，日陸軍特攻隊一誠機隊三架，以一機拼一艦，轟沉敵航母一艘，戰艦或巡洋艦二艘，日機掩護戰鬥隊於此役中，亦自炸一架，未飛返兩架，日航空部隊與特攻飛機隊，現對此等敵船團及機動部隊正繼續猛攻中。又菲律賓方面日航空部隊，積極攻擊突進日方陣四之敵船團機動部隊，並對明多羅及雷伊泰敵登陸基地，日夜加以强製，澈底妨害敵基地機之行動。即日航空部隊繼二兩日，攻擊桑霍塞及塔拉克敵機塲之後，由二日夜至四日拂曉，更對明多羅，雷伊泰兩島實行連續攻擊，如五日日大本營發表，於明多羅島桑霍塞，使敵方十七處起火，兩處爆炸，於雷伊泰島，使塔克羅班敵機塲十處起火，兩處爆炸及塔拉克機塲一處起火，是役，日機八架未飛返。敵機雖經日方空陸一致轟炸攻擊，但雷伊泰仍有敵機的三百架，明多羅島有小型機的五十或六十架。英國當此菲律賓戰局漸進白熱階段，甚注視其動向，爲牽制菲律賓戰局，其東印度艦隊於四日以航空母艦二艘或三艘爲主之機動部隊，出現蘇門答臘西北海面，其艦載機的八十架，於四日下午來襲蘇門答臘北部，該方面之日軍航空部隊，常即迎擊，演壯烈之邀擊戰，至是日薄暮，共擊落其二十六架，且戰果尙有擴大可能，日方損害則極輕微。一方敵有力機動部隊於三四兩日襲擊台灣後，尙遊弋於該島東北海面，目下菲律賓戰爭已擴大於合灣近海，菲律賓及印度洋敵八之決戰戰意仍甚旺盛，各該地之日陸海空部隊，團結一致，誓死殺敵，特攻隊精神宣　振發，勇敢戰鬥，至雷伊泰及明多羅島之陸上戰况，尙無任何變化也。</p>

<p>昭南六日中央社電　印度臨時政府主席鮑斯，爲慶祝中華民國國民政肘參戰兩週年紀念日，特發表聲明如次：際此中華民國國民政府參戰兩週年紀念日即將來臨，本人僅代表愛好和平自由之全印度國民及印度臨政府，表明甚深之祝意。國民政府於偉大之國父孫中山先生不屈不接之精神及國父唯一後繼者汪故主席之指導下，二年前對英美宣戰，國民政府爲自東亞驅逐英美，爲自可怕之英美帝國主義之桎梏下求東亞民族之解放，毅然與日本及東亞其他民族携手，加入此次之大規模之作戰。國民政府參戰二年，並所引起之事件，爲基於正義眞意之日本摧敗英美兩國之武力，國民政府及各東亞其他各國家，對此更爲確信，國民政府之參戰，不僅爲求中國之解放統一，且爲求全東亞各國之解放，而始加入此次之偉大聖戰。</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日下午四時四十分發表：六日下午來自中國方敵B29型機七八十架來襲九州西部地區，自雲上肓目轟炸，日方損害極爲輕微，關於邀繫戰果，刻正在調査中。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　中國大陸基地敵B29型機之空襲日本九州，目上月十九日以來，此次尙爲新年後之初次，此次來襲，含有響影菲律賓戰局新展開之意味頗多。是日敵機分作數批，自十時起逐次侵入九州西部要地，然以適値密雲滿布，雪花紛飛，故敵機之一部未得侵入要地，即於中途退轉，而其他敵機之轟炸，亦完全爲盲目轟炸。因之，日方損害極爲輕微，重要設施未蒙任何損失。日軍制空部隊當時曾冒密雲飛雪，與敵展開邀聲戰，戰果目下尙未判明。</p>

<p>里斯本六日中央社電　重要戰時運輸局設置目的，在謀打通來多公路及滇緬公路，據美聯社重慶電，新局長兪飛鵬於三日會見記者團時宣稱，旣使中印公路開通，亦全爲單用道路，民間運輸絕對禁止。重慶治下民衆，對各項物資之期待，此乃該公路開通之一縷希望，至是完全失掉。兪飛鵬氏言，準新設戰時運輸局內，技術方面由多數美人担當，倘中印公路開通後，重要任務爲美人之補給運渝，於特定限度內，參加運輸局之行政，且蔣介石氏之副參謀長馬克爾阿氏就任該局次長，則美國之支配重慶，已逐漸進至運渝方面矣。</p>

<h3 id="c14">誰是中國革命的領導者（二） <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田車祐</p>
<p>問：你說當時反對康有爲的官僚及士大夫階級，並非「帝國主義走狗」，那末以孫文爲領袖的中國知識份子，爲什麽起而革命，反對他們呢？</p>
<p>答：滿淸對於異族帝國主義的侵略，爲保護自己的地位，本想始終加以抵抗。然而滿淸知道，從正面進行反對異族帝國主義的戰爭，是不可能的。所以未能以毅然決然的態度，宣佈對外全面抗戰。因而中國官僚及人民，當與異族帝國主義發生衝突時，滿淸政府曾在背後加以鼓舞和激勵，形勢惡劣時，則佯作不知，以諉卸責任。結果，一部份一部份的土地和主權，雙手獻給異族帝國主義。滿清對於異族帝國主義這樣言總計從和懦弱無能的態度，激起了富有民族天良的人民，尤其是激起了知識份子。所以辜鴻銘一面辯護滿淸，一面解釋辛亥革命說：「此次革命之所以爆發，並非反對腐敗政府，而是反對政府軟弱，即是反對軟弱政府。此次革命的眞正動機，並非在於漢族仇視滿族。賦與革命以威力！暴力！的因素，就是中國人遭受外國人輕視和侮辱所激起來的劇烈反抗情緒。信仰這一具有敎養的義和團運動（Tis　Learning　boxer　movent指辛亥革命言，吉田註）者，全都認爲如此。只要我們是中國人，就受到外國人的輕視，這因爲我們的腦海上，帶着一根猪尾巴。我們受到外國人這樣的輕視和侮辱，事實上，滿淸應當担負這種責任。所以革命黨徒憎恨滿淸，而主張剷除中國領土上的一切滿淸作風。正如賢明的巴特南·惠魯（Putnam　Weale）所說，在現在「翦除猪尾巴的革命」當中，具有一個悲哀的世界（A　World　of　Pathos。總之，一九〇〇年義和團瘋狂事件之所以爆發，是由於殘缺的民族自尊心，而現在革命之所以爆發，則由於民族虛榮心。」（The　Story　of　a　Chinese　Oxford　Movement　By　Ku　Hung-ming．P．124）。</p>
<p>辜鴻銘固　是滿清末年的世界聞名批評等，但其政治思想却是保皇黨。他作了很久張之洞的秘書，而是由滿淸俸祿多年豢養出來的人，自然只能這樣理解辛亥革命的本質。固然，中國人因痛恨滿淸對異族帝國主義的軟弱無能而憤起，這是事實，但滿淸政府本身，也不能不負軟弱無能的責任。例如滿淸政府的最重要支柱官僚，在客觀上究竟盡了什麼任務？官僚曉得滿淸不能創造防禦異族帝國主義侵略的時候，則由一種「失敗主義」思想，而產生與異族帝國主義妥協的投靠行動，同時假藉異族力量，重整滿淸對中國農民的政治壓力。官僚以這種姿態來鞏固滿淸政府，同時，自已也勾結異族帝國主義者，不僅單純剝削農民大衆，而遠想組織利潤更加雄厚的近代化產業。所以，滿淸把中國主權逐漸贈與異族帝國主義的塲合，即割讓領土，圈定租界，移交鐵路管理權及海關，以及放棄中國領土內對外人的自主徵稅襯和民法刑法上的權利等塲合時，接受辦理此　喪權辱國條約約官僚們，也參與異族帝國主義者宰割中國的分肥工作。這樣的官僚，便由滿淸的忠臣，逐漸成爲異族帝國主義的忠臣了。結果，滿清政府大小官員，在中國人民大衆的眼光　　來，全是出賣中國人民利益的異族走狗。而中國人民的大部份爲漢族，異族走狗的主要部份爲滿族，所以「興漢反滿」的口號，深深地打動了人民大衆的心弦。本身就是一個滿淸官僚的辜鴻銘，自然未曾注意到滿清官僚業已發生了如此本質上的變化，所以他對於辛亥革命的見解和巴特南。惠魯一樣：「現在　髪辦革命之所以爆發，是由於崇拜民族虛榮心所致」。如沒有這一革命，老實說，辛亥革命之所以發動，決不是因爲民族虛榮心作崇。就不能跳過「只要是中國人就受到外國人輕視「的時代。爲與異族帝國主義鬥爭，則中國必須首先近代化，爲求近代化，則必先使中國的統治者近代化。中國的統治者如不願近代化，而反爲中國近代化的阻撓者，則必須剷除這一批統治者，而更換領導中國走向近代化的統治者。不幸康有爲等的運動失敗，這是證明滿淸政府本身不願近代化，反而妨碍中國的近代化。滿淸政府不僅不放棄封建性的剝削中國農民大衆，而且與異族帝國主義携手合作，企圖更加强化以往的剝削關係。於是辛亥革命，便應運而生。如從單反封建的觀點上看，很明顯，辛亥革命可以說是「太平天國」的繼續。當時滿淸政府的立塲，正如明治維新時高唱「開港論」而反對尊王攘夷的幕府立塲一樣。在客觀上，上述二者全想引狼入室，替異族帝國主義者開關一條侵略本國的康莊大道，而他們是不能使自已和和本國完成近代化的封建餘孽。這就是中國的民族革命運動，所以並沒有以君主政體的改良運動形式出現，而是以澈底破壞的運動形式而出現。</p>
<p>問：你說辛亥革命，是中國民族資本家的政治利益代表知識份子所發動的，但中國民族資本家與官僚的勾結相當根深蒂固，他們怎還能成爲反對官僚的主力軍呢？</p>
<p>答：在滿淸政府之下，官僚，地主，商業資本家以及高利貸資本家，相互勾結，而構成封建性剝削制度的四位一體。這些人在某種問題上，固然有時也利害衝突，而相互爭吵，但在基本問題上，例如對於農民問題，則始終是一致的，統一的。正如十九世紀初葉，曾無時無刻不爭吵的英普俄奧四國，反對大革命的法國，則組成「神聖同盟」的聯合戰綫。然而後來，當時資本主義最前進的英國，竟退出神聖同盟，而與革命的法國握手言歡。與此相同，滿淸政府之下，退出封建剝削的「四位一體」，而與中國的「革命法國」握手言歡者，就是民族資本家。再詳細一點說，即中國民族資本家，決不是像由蛹變成蛾那種樣正常關係一樣，從封建剝削制度蓄積起來的商業資本和高利貸資本中自然變成的。上面所說的滿淸封建剝削之「四位一體」，全都隷屬於異族帝國主義之下，而或多或少地盡着買辦作用，所以由商業資本和高利貸資本中發展起來的民族資本，當逐漸企圖開始資本主義的本來活動時，已經知道，由於異族帝國主義對中國的侵略，而且己的活動到處碰壁。國內重要產業（如鐵路之類），幾乎完全操於異族資本家之手，且封建剝削關係上的「四位一體」，全與異族資本家相勾結，而始終不願與民族資本家結成夥伴。於是民族資本家就急切地在周圍物色夥伴。第一，便碰到了知識份子。知職份子中有兩種，一種就是想常官僚貴族而失敗的舊式知識份子。康有爲一派就屬於這一類。舊式知識份子，亦即土大夫階級，是按「科舉」的成績而成爲官僚貴族的。然而滿淸政府末年「賣官　爵」成爲公開的秘密時，「科舉」的威信早已一落千丈，完全破產，而貧窮的士大夫階級，想當滿淸政府的官員，實戛乎其難。因此，舊式知識份子中，反對滿淸政府的「不滿份子」，也大有人在。其中曾有參加革命的份子，正如法國大革命時，拉法夷脫（La　Fayette）和米拉菩（Mirabeau）等貴族階級出身的人物也曾參加推翻柏蓬（Burbon）王朝的革命一樣。另一種知識份子，就是受有外國（特別受有日本和美國的）敎育的近代知識份子中比較美國人民生活和中國人民生活。於是這批人瞭解了滿清統治下的人民，尤其農民，是如何在封建剝削關係的鐵蹄蹂躪之下呻吟着，是如休在專制魔王的宰割之下被剝去所有的自由，他們理解到同樣亞洲人的日本，把異族帝國主義驅逐出去後，是如何在短期內國家得到了長足的進步。日本推翻了阻撓日本近代化的支配勢力——幕府。並且建立起吸收外國文化，而能保證無傷獨立自由的近代化政府。然後曾大量輸入外國文化。以致這一亞洲小國，竟能於一九〇六年擊敗一個歐洲大國。這一事實，曾極度鼓舞過中國的近代知識份子。他們想，只要把腐敗的滿淸推翻，則中國至少能取得五千萬人口日本那樣八倍以上的國力，這兩種對比，在孫中山先生的思想中整理後，便成爲三民主義的基礎。與其稱三民主義爲革命理論，勿寗說是以革命熱情所叙述出來的革命思想。不要忘記，正因爲三民主義革命理論具有含混性，才最適合於指導當時全部　雜萬分的革命　營。某種理倫家指摘孫中山先生的思想中，缺乏明確性的革命理論，但這種人並沒有注意到，唯其是含混理論，方能指導含有複雜錯綜　素的辛亥革命。</p>
<p>第地一，資產階級所要連絡的，就是直接反對封建「四位一體」的農民。農民反對地主的鬥爭，反對高利貸資本的鬥爭，歸根究底就是反對滿淸的鬥爭，亦就是反對帝國主義的鬥爭。資產階級曾想把這種農民的鬥爭力量，引導到革命的路軌上。所以眞正繼承辛亥革命傳統的國民黨第一次全國代表大會宣言。會明白指出：「反抗帝國主義與軍閥，反對不利於農工之特殊階級，以謀農工之解放」。但辛亥革命時期，工人尙未成爲一個具有獨立自覺的階級。</p>
<p>第三，便　是軍閥和士兵，滿清政府末年，維持地方治安的軍官，便　成爲半獨立的軍閥。他們把士兵作成自己的私有財產，把自己維持治安的區域，作成自己私有的地盤。他們大多數，早已失去忠實於滿淸的觀念。而他們指揮下的兵士，多半都是失掉土地的農民，其所以當兵的理由，就是軍閥們可以保體他們的衣食住生活。軍閥和兵士全都怒髮冲冠地憤恨異族帝國主義的侵略，而對於中國現狀，非常表示不滿。所以他們很容易接受革命黨的宣傳，而成爲革命的夥伴。職是之故，辛亥革命時曾嚇得屁滾尿流，鑽人床底，　觫萬狀的黎元洪，當稍一鎭靜，即向袁世凱發出下列書信：「國庫與國民軍，乃爲帝國根基，此二者皆在無智幼弱之滿人黨中，試觀中國四億人民之財產及生命，爲少數滿人所左右，閣下豈得心平……」如瞭解黎元洪是當時曾受過日本敎育的一個「最進步軍人」，則決不會認爲該聲明是由革命黨人强迫寫成的。</p>
<p>總之，辛亥革命是不滿於滿清腐敗的各種階層，聯合起來產生的。該聯合陣營中的民族資本家及其政治代表孫中山派，其領導權決不是强而有力的。所以辛亥革命不久後，直至蔣介石北伐時，革命陣營內資產階級的領導權，常常幾乎被同一陣營內的其他階層所推翻。孫中山先生旣有滿腔熱血，爲政力拯救中國於水火，反對帝國主義的侵略，所以總是受到中國人民大衆的擁護。這也就是孫中山先生幾次革命失敗，而仍能捲土重來的一個理由。（靖譯）</p>

<p>……陳代主席致調，很爲自謙，但發言極有力。其中引述汪先生十年來「爲國無我」的苦心孤詣，處境憂迫時，熱淚盈眶，聽者動容。說到繼承在先生精神，祗須與國家統一有利，不辭犧牲一切，負責向全國同胞擔保時，則又大聲疾呼，激昻慷慨。</p>
<p>……各團體致贈陳市長大銀杯一只，鐫有「滬民愛戴」四字，連木框高可及人，這銀杯目前的價値，在十年前也許可造一隻二千噸的輪船。</p>
<p>……主席團代表演說詞中，說到要求嚴禁勒索，取締黑帽子時，聰者心理大家頷首。說到剷除貪汚，剷除暴利時，也許某些人的心理爲之震顫。</p>
<p>……中國新聞協會上海區茶會中，主人方面胸懸紅花緞帶，殷勤欵接來賓，似乎喜氣洋洋，正中一虎最受注目，忙累了攝影記者。在座者有盟邦森海軍少將，海軍報道部長松島大佐，大使館松平部長，華中振興公司總裁高島菊次郞等，我國方面新任皖省長林柏生，市府秘書長吳頌皐，李贊老，聞蘭老等。袁履老則在另一桌上暢談數十年來物價變遷，項康原氏態度瀟灑，發言甚少。盟邦報道及新聞界人士致賀者甚衆，其中尤以鹽田大尉藍呢制服制帽，腰佩長刀，肩披黑氅，最爲軒昻。</p>
<p>……歡迎陳代主席茶會與上海區新聞協會茶會，席間空氣頗有不同，前者莊嚴肅穆，落針可聞；後者則充滿和穆氣象，旣未致詞，亦無演說，各踞一座，高談闊論，笑聲時作，一若家人間團聚。（澄）</p>

<h3 id="c28">作戰時間愈長　敵美消耗愈甚　鹽田大尉分析戰局 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>菲島作戰，日軍已操必勝之券，證銘最近捷訊，尤爲明顯。頃由海軍報道部鹽田大尉加以分析，略謂：此次敵美機動部隊在明多羅及台灣之進攻，實爲其最後一滴力量的表現。雷伊泰島登陸之美軍，約十五萬，明多羅方面約爲二萬至三萬，而麥克沃塞軍隊之補給基地，則爲帛琉島，新幾內亞東方基地，以及更遙遠之澳洲霉黎。至若尼米資之基地，則爲夏威夷，因補給綫之長而且遠，維持之方困難重重，非有充份之陸海軍力爲準備，無有不虞隕越者。但我人以美國之人力及生產力量而言，美人目下實極痛苦，此次明多羅及台灣之役，旣爲美軍最後力量之表現，麥克沃塞如欲佔據菲島各都市，實爲不可能之事，竭其力所能，所佔領者惟廣大地域中之數點而已。而日軍之力量則日益增强，作戰時間愈長，美軍的痛苦亦愈甚，乃爲意料中事。</p>
<p>海戰失敗敵美乞援</p>
<p>關於海軍作戰方面，尼米資於屢次海戰失敗之後呼援於歐洲荷蘭及法國，欲以其湊集而成之兵力移攻菲島及台灣，此項海上兵力如係鉅大之艦　，或尙可借之一逞，但事實上此湊集之所謂艦隊，力量殊爲渺小，雖經集中，亦無能爲力，不論其速率及作戰力參差不齊，即指揮上亦生問題，烏合之眾，即能全部移至太平洋上，亦不堪一擊，所能效勞者，不過衛護敵方之輸送路綫而已。敵美作戰首腦部遭遇種種困難，不言而喻。即如敵美首腦部曾說，聯合國雖號稱向日本作戰，但實際作戰者，並非全體，僅我美國一國而已。更謂對日作戰，又非受到種種損失不可，故其在太平洋上作戰，內心之可知。</p>
<p>日本威力强大</p>
<p>反之，日本在菲島作戰，其能利用之運輸船舶及巨型艦艇以爲軍隊補給者，爲數殊夥。自當伊泰島戰幕揭開以來，日本對菲島方面陸海軍共同增加之兵力，早已準備萬全，今後敵人必將受到許多損失甚至消耗其實力，予以致命之打擊。日本之航空部隊更利用最新型飛機，發揮最大威力，敵方之機動部隊力量，異常薄弱，尤其爲攻擊方式極形低微。敵方雖利用其殘餘之艦隊，預備阻遏日方之兵力集中，但心勞日拙，此種上計劃亦毫無用處。綜上所述，敵方爲掩飾其戰敗之弱點計，以後或更將在別處登陸，但島嶼繁夥，故其登陸之地點無從　測，但民答那餓或呂宋島似亦在可能之範圍中。以菲島地定，敵人無論在何處登陸，必遭日軍迎頭痛擊，不必顧慮，而日軍之强大航空隊，尤必能發揮其至上威力，獲得殲敵之良好機會。</p>
<p>敵美企圖速戰速決</p>
<p>敵方屢受日軍之消耗作戰，其損失之重大，自不待言。自作戰方面講，兵　戰力，遠不及基地航空部隊戰力之强大，故敵如來犯，其所受之耗損，當更爲鉅大，尤其爲陸海軍特別攻擊隊，對敵人如摧枯拉朽，予以莫可補償之損失，今日（六日）日本大本營發表明多羅島日特別攻擊機隊擊沉敵方運輸艦兩艘，平均每一運輸船之船員爲一千人，故已有二千人葬身魚腹。另一特別攻擊隊在呂宋島西方海面，擊沉敵航空母艦兩艘，戰艦一艘，此種航空母艦係屬於補助級者，船員約爲三千人，中型之戰艦則爲一千一百人，日方　與此役之特別攻擊隊只有飛機六架，而予敵方以如此鉅大之損失，即單以人員而論，已殲敵五千一百餘人，如此塲面之消耗戰，美國損失之鉅大，彰彰明甚，其國力之耗損，更不待贅。故作戰時間愈長，美方之消耗愈甚，美國對日作戰，一向欲利用速戰速決者，其理在此。敵方於屢次敗績之下，只有利用蘇門答臘或在華空軍以及塞班島，甚至擴大其阿留申島之空軍基地，對日本本土肆以空襲，但此種舉動僅爲敵方焦慮作戰之表示而已。總之，菲島戰局實爲大東亞戰局中重要戰鬥之一關鍵，而日本軍民，咸抱必勝信念，沉毅應付之。</p>
<p>菲島民眾自衛組織</p>
<p>菲律憲賓人民在洛勒兩總統領導之下，獨立運動風起雲湧，進展殊速，而於推選新政，得日本方面之翼贊，建樹旣多，著效尤顯。惟破壞之者，對此獨立運動派，不惜出以遊擊方式，加以摧殘。若　以明多羅及雷伊泰興島作爲反抗之根據，並撥將菲島劃爲十個戰區，各地受其肆擾，固無可歸，但日軍決加以封鎖，各個擊破，行見殲滅之期，已不在遠。</p>
<p>美國百計欲將菲島奪囘，並渴欲得菲人爲助，雖其作戰之途徑不一，而其攻擊雷伊泰興島利用當地之遊擊隊，更希望於獲得雷島基地後，把握菲人令其協力，事殊明顯。孰知事與願違，其所希望者適得其反，菲律賓以馬尼剌爲主，大小各地，民眾自衛組織異常强化，警備網遍地皆是，故美人所希望之遊擊，其成功終歸於泡影。此種民間自衛組織，根基摯固，美雖時肆空襲，未能動其分毫。自云歲九月以還，敵曾一再大肆轟炸，而民心堅强，一無動搖跡象，殊堪告慰。空襲下之損害，雖亦匪輕，但以食糧及工築等作爲中心之增產運動，遏進無已，所蒙損害已逐漸在恢復中矣。所謂增產運動，並非指一地一區而言，實係各地普遍現象，自給自足，根深蒂固，可斷言耳。</p>
<p>神風隊員紀律嚴謹</p>
<p>頃據菲島來客談：日航空隊員最近希望加入神風特別攻擊隊者，爲數極多，幾已佔其全數，隊員等均抱最大決心，視融會貫通如歸，而於嚴守紀律一點，尤堪欽佩。據云：某日有神風隊員一隊，齊集一起，整備出發，不知如何忽將油燈打翻，霎時間火光熊熊，隊員等不覺高聲拍手，以爲戲樂，當時有少尉某年事極輕，聞訊趕到，緊囑隊員鎭定，不得稍有　　，夫神風隊員以身許國，在此臨死之一瞬間，對於紀律尙不得稍有弛懈，平日治軍之嚴，於此可見一斑。</p>

<p>— 田寬</p>
<p>蔣介石在今年元旦日的廣播，打破了從來的慣例，毫不言及國際關係，祗是呼籲國民，側重抗建的具體方策，引起民眾注意。但同時，這卻成爲各階層嚴刻批評的「眾矢之的」。眞正愛國而憂慮中國將來的人士，一定熟讀蔣氏的演辭，細味其內容，探究中國可行的途徑及蔣氏的內心。結果，得到的結論便是：「蔣氏的指導方針是否確爲拯救中國的正道？而民眾的批評則可大別爲二，即對於蔣氏仍然信仛，或大感失望。</p>
<p>中共方面的批判，係民眾呼聲的一部分，我們有傾聽的必要。延安與重慶因處於對立的政敵立塲，而在思想上，政治上，軍事上也儘多新分舊恨，所以對於蔣氏的批評，當然不免含有感情用事的謾罵，這是我們必須想到的。不過，延安常立在民眾方面而言民眾所欲言者，倒也並非子虛。本月四日延安的廣播關於蔣氏的演說有極辛辣的批評，指出蔣氏的矛盾及欺騙，可謂盡其能事，但我們在其惡毒的言辭中，也可發見若干點不無理由。例如說：</p>
<p>蔣介石所說的去年最大的危機，本出於國民黨敗戰主義的法西斯政策，但却使社會負其責任。並稱因爲國民負擔不够，以致給予軍隊的戰意及戰鬥行爲很大的影響，也是社會的責任。而政府的自我批評，則不過聲稱戰時行政欠徹底而已。祗要指出這一點，民眾對於蔣介石氏寡頭政治的憎惡，即可想見了。」</p>
<p>憎惡的程度如何，姑作別論，而蔣氏爲了挨過今年這一年，却强求國民犧牲，忍受任何苛歙誅求，要地主和富豪供出金錢與食糧，這對於疲敝已極的民眾，實是生死問題。對於過去八年來加速度增大的戰爭負擔之更行强化，而同時還要替人負起戰敗的責任，不論是怎樣的民眾，也不免要發出不平之鳴的。</p>
<p>其次，延安方面對於蔣氏「祗要軍　情勢安定，反攻基礎確立，即當頒布憲法，還政於民」的預約，則徹底暴露其欺騙性。他說：</p>
<p>「蔣介石的聲明，以中國人沒有記憶轓基礎，但實際上我們的記憶力是非常好的，我們知道一九三四年二月十日理應實施憲政，也沒有忘記在一九三六年十一月十二日，一九三七年十一月，一九四〇年十一月十二日召集國民大會而實行憲政的國民黨的諾言。並且還聽到戰爭終了後一年內實行憲政的約定。而且，這些約定的時日有許多是在戰爭開始以前的。當時，國民大會的召集，實際上不是毫無使其困難的軍事危機嗎？然則，爲何不如期召集呢？」</p>
<p>接着，關於「祗要軍事情勢安定，反攻基礎確立」這句話，反駁如下：</p>
<p>「過去七年半中，軍事情勢並未壞到現在這樣。那末，軍事情勢安定，反攻基礎確立究竟要等到何時呢？蔣介石雖然常說最後勝利絕對有把握，但在一九四五年正月却突然向世界發出最後勝利並未確定保的話來。過去，召開國民大會是有日期的，而今日的約定中，却不說明日期了，並對軍事情勢的安定與反攻基礎的確立如此沒有自信。」</p>
<p>延安方面猛烈非難蔣氏的空頭支票以後，更提出實際問題，詢問國民大會的內容是和戰前一樣的，還是從新選舉代表？並提出如果是後者的話，則在抗戰時何如選出地方代表，以及誰司其會等等疑問。</p>
<p>延安方面的指摘，觸及蔣氏的痛處。作爲動員民眾繼續抗戰的法寶而提出來的實話憲政的諾言，與蔣氏的眞正意向所在的相左跡象，由此暴露無遺了。</p>
<h3 id="c30">大東亞戰爭　必勝關鍵 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑文越</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭已　　決戰階段，最後勝利必屬於我，當可十分肯定，茲無論在緒戰時期，盟邦以廳襲戰略，突擊戰術，將敵人打得心驚膽寒，已奠定了勝利的基礎，在本格戰時期，盟邦一面開發資源，增厚戰力，一面實施出血戰術，使敵之遭受重大損害，其最後的勝利，自屬毫無問題，但敵人究竟何以必敗，大東亞究竟何以必勝，其主要關鍵，特分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）政治的：大東亞戰爭主義與不義之爭，敵人是侵略東亞的，屬於不義的，盟邦是求東，屬於正義的，師直爲壯，曲爲老，敵人以不義之師，結果又焉能不敗。</p>
<p>（二）心理的：此次戰爭，一方爲人和，一方爲離異，在敵人雖曰聯合，實則同床異夢，合而不知。在盟邦則上下一心，同仇敵愾，同時更提携大東亞整個民族，造成大東亞十憶民眾的大黑結，語云：「師克在和」，以此種人和的力量，前　後方共同努力，最後勝利自操左券。</p>
<p>（三）精神的：盟邦的精神，是熊貓的，敵人的精神，是畏縮的，敵人以士氣自餒毫無犧牲精神之將士，與盟邦理直氣壯自律精神旺盛之師相抗衡，勝負自可判定。</p>
<p>（四）戰略及戰術的：敵人的戰略戰術是遲鈍的，往時的外綫作戰，盟邦是正確的，主動的內綫作戰，外綫作戰重包圍，內綫作戰重突破，盟邦於緒戰中，已將敵人的包圍一舉突破，因而敵人不得不捨棄外綫作戰，最優勢的長期戰，包圍戰的戰略，而採取了最不利的積極進攻的戰略和飛機猛炸的戰術。盟邦則確保資源，反攻爲守，倒成了長期不敗的態勢，採用攻勢防禦戰略，出血戰術，大量消耗敵人戰力，使之日趨削弱，然後再一興殲滅殘敵，完成最後勝利，這正是盟邦戰略。戰術正確優越的成功。</p>
<p>（五）地利的：敵人是勞師遠征，盟邦是以逸待勞，此種情勢，愈到最後決戰時期愈爲顯將，自古以來，窮兵黷武，勞師遠征的無不敗，利用地形，以逸待勞的無不勝，如征俄之役，拿破崙之破，日俄之役，俄艦隊對馬之敗，爲極明顯的先例，有以往三年戰爭的成果，以及歷史，政治，人心，犧牲精神，戰略戰術和地理關係，大東亞戰爭最後勝利，一定屬於我，不久即可實現了。（中央社）</p>

<p>— 司徒薇</p>
<p>忽然從奇怪的夢境中醒來，很冷很冷的夜裏，人遂好像有點跋涉長途之後的疲倦了。</p>
<p>現在我已經不大記得清楚那個夢。它已經模糊下去，而且還正在模糊下去如遠代的水墨畫—那些不存在的地方和不存在的人物：那規陽光淡薄的小庭院，那鵝卵石上流瀉着幽冷的斑駁的　徑，寂寞的嘆息和切切細語。</p>
<p>（在這樣的無燈無月的夜裏，這樣地深思的時候，善於作夢的年輕人：你猜我是不是將掇拾一份輕微的悵惘—一份奇怪的，像未曾攙足方搪的黑咖啡似的悵惘，正像掇拾一份恐怖的幻想一樣容易呢？）</p>
<p>我好像站在薄暮的小城鎭，聽一陣馬路聲敲澈年老的長街，寂寞又憂慘的漸漸遠去。我又好像在遠行前遺失了貴重的東西，我說不出那名稱，然而我分明覺得遺失了甚麼。</p>
<p>我惦念那些遺失的東西如惦念昨天的太陽光，惦念我自己的孤伶伶的影子。</p>
<p>—我遺失了甚麼呢？</p>
<p>想着的時候我燃起一支烟，而且噴吐出來在這無月的夜裏。夜間　我看見面前亮起一顆孤獨的小星，一粒深思的憂　的眸子。我也看見有糾結的藤蘰從我嘴角爬起來，爬過溫柔的明滅的微光，露出她們那如帶如環的乳白的身段。</p>
<p>而我則悵惘地仰臥在床上，以漠然的眼色瞪視高高地堆疊起來的夜暗。冰冷冰冷夜暗，一直堆疊到大花板。這樣地瞪視那些記憶中的不存在的地方和不存在的人物，我知道，正如現在我瞪視面前那一束如帶如環的烟霧。她們看起來似乎「瞬息萬變」，炫耀不盡生命的瑰麗。其實每一秒鐘都正在悄融和裉色—每一秒鐘却正在老去。那青春的不久就會褪盡的！</p>
<p>「美麗的生命學堂是短促的生命」，當紙烟端那一粒微光逐漸闇淡的時候，我想：「使人惦念的東西永遠是容易逍失的東西…」</p>
<p>—然而我倒底遺失了甚麼呢？在這很冷很冷的夜裏。</p>
<p>善於作夢的年輕人，我想你能够告訴我。因爲這世界上只有一樣失去了就永遠失去的東西，而你也知道人們從來不會有兩個相同的夢。</p>

<p>— 儀宣</p>
<p>雨聲淅淅，風聲瀟瀟，寒風從窗隙送入，在黯淡的燈光下，頓覺已是嚴冬季候了。神緒很闌珊，感懷故人，還能想些什麼呢？</p>
<h3 id="c33">噩夢 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>旣　患於白日之嘈嚷，復不給我夢寐之安寗，豈我有太狹的方舟，不勝載世紀的災害。</p>
<p>無須以冷爪，揭我的創傷，也無須以揶揄。燃點與燐火。</p>
<p>隨手取了一本照相册，一頁頁翻着；这些熟習的脸龐，有的仍處在幸福圈裏，有的已飽經滄桑；隨着時序，幾許稚氣滿面的容顏；然而命運也給她們帶來了意想不到的遭遇。</p>
<p>突然門鈴響了，在這雨夜，不會有誰來探望我，也許是請出診的病人，但是那問訊的聲音很熟悉，仔細一聽，我如飛奔下樓去。</p>
<p>「芳，久違了！快請樓上坐。」我連拖帶請地迎她到房中，在燈光下，我幾乎不敢確定她是闊別年餘的好友。</p>
<p>那豐腴的面頰，神彩弈弈的眸子，都已消失無蹤；現正在我面前的玉芳，竟是那樣憔悴，瘦削，徬徨無主。</p>
<p>我請她脫去濕淋淋的雨披，她搖頭拒絕；相對默立了好久，她幾次欲言又止，我被過度的驚奇和喜悅所抑，一時竟不知何從談起。</p>
<p>她翻閱着照相册，我茫然視着從她身上滴下的雨水，思緒也如水滴般匯成了一片。</p>
<p>不見玉芳快近二年了，在這些時光中，對於她的狀况，我知道得很清楚；我不是杞人，然而我有着杞人一般的敏感；遠在四五年前，從她好虛榮的習性，薄弱的意志，清寒的家境，我常憂懼着，她將走上墮落的路；可是我始終沒有把握隱憂透露過。曾幾何時？憂懼成了事實，甚至比我想像的更惡劣十分。</p>
<p>最初，友人們傳說她作了舞女，我還不敢相信；直到有一天，我偶然在一條熱鬧的路上遇到她，我不禁爲之目眩：皮大衣，高跟鞋，畫得彎彎的眉，塗得猩紅的口，把一個活潑的女孩子，裝成了雍容華貴的少婦；她似乎很窘，匆匆寒暄幾句，就和我握手道別；這一條路上，正密佈着舞廳，於是我信實了傳言，我也明白了她規避我們的原因。</p>
<p>然而她沒有想到我們這幾個和她接近的友伴，却絲毫沒有輕視她的意思；相反的，我們是滿懷的同情；雖然我們無力使她脫離不良的環境，但是我們願意當她行走在歧路上時，予她以援助和指示，但是她隔絕了我們。</p>
<p>「伴舞並不失爲正當的職業，祗須她確是在出賣她的技藝，而不是出賣她的肉體和靈魂。」這幾句話我們時時要想貢獻給玉芳，雖然她未必不知道；但是在那聲色塲中，有幾個人是光明純潔的？也許初踏進時，是清醒，日久後，爲一切物質，色情的誘惑，就隨波逐流，跌入了迷津。</p>
<p>在低低的傾訴中，玉芳告訴我，她受了人的愚弄；她被　去了清白，以及畢生的幸福，而今所得到的是腹中的身孕；她還年青，還只有二十歲，她還要名譽，還要前途；因此她來要求我轉請父親，把這個未長成的小生命毀掉。</p>
<p>我知道這是違法的事，但經不了她的苦求，我終於走進父親室內。</p>
<p>我鼓足勇氣向前問道：「墮胎是否一定犯法？」</p>
<p>「不一定，需看情形論。假使爲了病勢嚴重，非把胎兒取下，不足以救母親，那末墮胎並不違法；但在可能範圍內，應竭力保全母子雙方的平安。」</p>
<p>「假如爲了一個女子的名譽和前途，父親，你可否施行一次？」於是我把玉芳的難堪告訴他。</p>
<p>「不可以，」父親嚴峻的回答：你讀法律的，難道不知道法律的規定？」</p>
<p>我轉告玉芳，她當然失望非凡，呻吟了一會，她就親自去請求父親，所得到的結果，仍是拒絕；父親說：「小姐，我知道你的苦衷，奈何這不僅是違法的舉動，在醫師的道德上，也是一件不當作的事；但是等到足月時，我可以爲你接產，並且立誓保守這個秘密，孩子也由我來安排。」</p>
<p>除了這，沒有再妥當的辦法；玉芳無奈，祗得起身告辭。最後父親至誠地叮嚀她：「千萬不是再找別的醫生爲你墮胎，這不但對於自己的生命有危險，而且任意殺害一個生命，是如何的無人道。已造成的錯誤，可用眞心的悔改來彌補。」</p>
<p>玉芳走後，父親惋惜的嘆道「好好的一個女孩子，怎麼走上了這樣路？眞太沒出息了！」</p>
<p>父親最後的一句話，激起了我的同情，我不覺爲她申辯：「父親，你不要專怪她，她的家庭方面，也該負一半的責任；她的父母只知用嚴厲來壓制子女，忽略了善意的開導；玉芳初沾上虛榮的惡習時，他們不加勸阻，成天成晚讓她消磨在舞塲裏；待她正式作了舞女，就輕視她，詈罵她，在家庭裏　她絲毫得不到安慰和正確的啟示；連至親的骨肉也沒有一點溫情，當然，一聽到旁人的花言巧語，就容易輕信，容易入榖；倒底還是一個天眞未泯的女孩子，叫她一時間怎分得清黑與白？正與邪？倘如她的父母能用愛來糾正她的錯誤，她一定明白不正當的男女之愛是虛偽的，卑鄙的，不可靠的，她也一定能安於清貧，不貪圖那世俗的繁華。」</p>
<p>父親更是嘆聲連連，我知道他是以父母之心在體味玉芳的雙親，將是何種心緒？</p>

<p>— 朱麟</p>
<p>××烟廠在門口貼了一張告白，要招二個小工，第二天清早擠在廠門口的人有三十多。</p>
<p>賬房先生原是剛從學校裏出來很富於朝氣和同情心的青年，面對着這一張張樸實的臉，不知該僱用誰才好，因爲，這些人似乎都有立刻找到職業解決生活的必要。</p>
<p>他弄得沒有法子，祗好叫工頭一個個喊進來問幾句簡單的話。</p>
<p>這時，工頭喊進來一個很瘦少的青年，從清癯的臉和拍板的手上，賬房先生看出這不是勞働者的樣子，便照例地問着：「你叫什麽？」</p>
<p>「吳朝國，口天吳，朝廷的朝，國家的國。」</p>
<p>賬房先生從第一句答話裏就怔住了，這是念過幾年書的人所能說的話。</p>
<p>「那兒人？」</p>
<p>「安徽？」</p>
<p>「你不怕做小工苦得很嗎？」</p>
<p>「爲了生活，有什麼好苦的罷？」</p>
<p>「小工工細是最少的。」</p>
<p>「但比挨餓可强多了。」</p>
<p>賬房先生覺得這不是做小工的人，旣不能給他幫助，又何必提些不相干的問題來難爲他呢？便揮一下手說：「下午來聽回音吧！」</p>
<p>瘦小的吳朝國踽踽地出去了。</p>
<p>一個文弱書生型的年青人，願意來做工作最辛苦待遇最低下的小工，這是賬房先生深感奇特的事，却也正因爲這奇特所引起的深思的結果，吳朝國居然領到了工牌去上工了，他似乎也知道賬房先生的好心，所以每逢上工看見帳戶先生時，總恭恭敬敬叫聲：「×先生！」</p>
<p>其實，他每天祗拿二百五十塊錢工資，是全廠中工資最低的人，幸而他沒有家累，食量又小，日子倒並不比別的工人難過，就是沒有一點力氣，當他每次　着大香烟箱從四層樓走下七八級扶梯時種搖搖欲墜的樣子直叫人擔心，也因此，常常惹起打包間管理員的嚕　的，但一看那張菜色的臉，就覺得不能開口，因爲他知道，誰甘心情願來做苦工呢，如果他有較好的出路的話。</p>
<p>何况，他每天祗穿二件單衫來上工，早最儘冷得發抖，賬房先生有一天問他：</p>
<p>「怎麼不多穿幾件衣服？」</p>
<p>「冬天的衣服都在夏天裏吃光了。」</p>
<p>賬房先生沒有再問下去，他想起可以爲他在廠方設法預支一點工資，就告訴他：</p>
<p>「散了工到賬房間來一趟。」</p>
<p>賬房先生做了一個簽呈，在主任那兒說了幾句好話，借到了要在上半月工資內扣除的二千塊錢。</p>
<p>傍晚，吳朝國從賬房先生那兒接這筆錢時，他感激得幾乎掉下眼淚來，他這才告訴了賬房先生：</p>
<p>「我原了居初中畢業了的，不幸父母都爲貧病煎迫死了，幾年來一直在泥西的小學裏敎書，可是小學敎師一個月自吃飯祗拿二三千塊錢，一年又祗發十個月的薪水，叫人怎麼過活呢？後來就連小學敎師也找不到了，幾個月吃盡當光，眞是　得山窮水盡。」</p>
<p>賬房先生聽得很受感動，他決意儘自己的能力給這不幸的人一點幫助。</p>
<p>當吳朝國穿上把預支工資買來的新衛生衫時，他是暖和的，正與賬房先生心裏的暖和相同，然而十五號發放工資時，吳朝國除去了預支祗賸下了七百五十塊錢，這可叫賬房先生想起了，七百五十塊錢要維持到月底那怎麼成呢？</p>
<p>於是，賬房先生　出工資袋時，不能不補上一句：「用光了再來借一點吧！」</p>
<p>正在米價迅速昇　突破×萬大關的日子裏，沒有幾天，賬房先生再一次　　　　在主任那兒央求借了一千五百塊錢，而且由賬房先生慨然允諾做了保人。</p>
<p>但，吳朝國告病假了。</p>
<p>病是咯血和喉炎，賬房先生曾叫一個住得鄰近的工友去看過他，回來一問病情，賬房先生斷定他患的是嚴重的肺病。</p>
<p>十多天之後，吳朝國出現在賬房先生面前。他病得兩眼直凹，顴骨高聳，用遲鈍的死去也似的眼神釘着账房先生。</p>
<p>「×先生！」</p>
<p>賬房先生從他的顫抖中發覺他穿的舊夾衫中失去了衛生衫。</p>
<p>但是吳朝國已經覺察了賬房先生的注意了：</p>
<p>「衛生衫換了藥吃了。」</p>
<p>「你這怎麼辦呢？」</p>
<p>「看一趟醫生要三百多，吃一帖藥六七百，除了等死有什麼辦法呢？」</p>
<p>賬房先生摸了摸自己口袋裏剛拿到的薪水，但他起起了自己的老母弱弟，也想起了幾萬塊錢一擔的米，更想起了爲吳朝國擔保的借款，他感到非常的躊躇。</p>
<p>但，站在他面前的　靈似的病人叩擊着他的善良的心，他就抱着絕大的決心似的從自己一整月辛勞所得的菲薄的報酬中數了六百塊錢給他。</p>
<p>「這是我私人幫助你的」。</p>
<p>我知道，吳朝國慢慢地伸出手接了錢，發着微微的聲息說：「你還爲我擔保了借款，×先生，你的好心我今生不能報答，到來世再報答你吧！」</p>
<p>賬房先生的心感到非常的沉重，祗說了句「好好回去休息」，就送他出了廠門。</p>
<p>又是一個星期之後。</p>
<p>有一個工友來告訴賬房先生：</p>
<p>「吳朝國吐血死了，死在他借住的××紗廠的工房裏，他原是一個親人也沒有的單身人，怪可憐的，今天早長出普善山莊…」</p>
<p>賬房先生不忍再聽下去了。</p>
<p>他覺得也許是自己害了他，如果當時不錄用他來做小工，不做那麼辛苦的工作，他也許不致於死得那般快吧！他覺得病苦，因爲當他還在學校裏的時候，他從沒有想到過世間會有這樣悲慘的事情，就是今天他還在懷疑：</p>
<p>社會竟是這般殘酷的嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c40">中葡盃　前車可鑒　再貢獻中華隊陣容 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 謝益欽</p>
<p>停頓數年之中葡盃，本屈由足聯會恢復以後，球迷聞之，雀躍無已。蓋本屆中華隊人材濟濟，而葡萄牙軍容亦極整齊，在球藝方面，必有可觀之點，毫無疑義。進而以中華之現况而論，迎拔三城，未使無望。上期必賢君貢獻之陣容，極有見地，惜當局未加以採納。下半時更隨意調換，張林根之塡後，李義臣之中堅，孫錦順之中鋒，俱屬强其所難，作嘗試之一擲。試問在此有關國際榮譽之比賽中。豈能有所成就，於是一敗墜地，慘遭敗績，徒令萬千球迷，大爲掃興。萱失敗尙屬其次，無良好之表演，則不能不令人認爲遺憾，往者已矣。該盃賽取三賽二勝制，中華隊旣失首賽，得一敎訓自當加倍整飭，則再奪取二塲勝利，仍可獲本屆恢復之中葡盃也。筆者乘其第二塲日期尙未定奪之前，略抒私見，實爲亡羊補牢，未雨綢繆雙關鏈之文也。</p>
<p>首次比賽葡隊優點</p>
<p>先直溯葡萄牙隊第一戰之優點。論其全隊，可稱能做到呵成一氣之化境。特殊之點，即爲中衛綫有呼前應後之能力。其次便是前鋒人選之調度得當，以V蘇若之左移爲翼一，收兩翼齊飛之效。而中鋒鮑休脫善奔馳作突出之衝突，兩內鋒萊達　潘脫遜，俱能退後作七衛制之助守。進攻時作掩護之工作，乃其錄綫完成一正式之w字型，且各得用其所長，而中華隊之守衛，又屬軟弱，故葡隊遂發揮遺</p>
<p>我中華隊失敗原因</p>
<p>既窺出葡隊各方面之優點，乃可求阻遏之法，在此不妨再談是日中華之各個批評。則我謂孟義良吳祺祥有滿意之收獲，張林根鄭英耀羅壽福失常，餘子平平而已。茲再進一步作下戰之陣容商確，務希當局予以相當採納，莫以爲紙上談兵而疏忽，幸日甚矣！</p>
<p>一隊伍之能否有連繫性，中衛綫最爲重要。觀乎中華前敗，葡隊凱捷益信其然，故敢先作中衛綫之研究，中堅一職，余以爲應必用宋靈聖。蓋宋爲善於帶球之好手，策動攻勢，賴此中路，先爲取之策。况對中鋒鮑休脫身材長度，奔竄之速，周宋又有相似之處，乃以宋注意鮑休脫，可保無慮。則葡隊中央突破之術，可以休矣。則左前衛仍應用孟養良，義良近來情形，極見良好。前戰糾驟福恩，頗有成效。故一般均謂福恩該戰發展不多，應屬失常，此則誤解，實要歸功于義良之賣力。是則用義良之充沛氣力，逼住福恩，無異折其一翼。再輔用譚福楨爲右前衛，此說必有人予以反對，且爲譚本人所不願輕試者，唯細察對方之左鋒及左翼，左鋒退後助衛，利用翼之急進。翼爲造詣殊深之V蘇若。蘇若之球藝靜中有路，周老譚如出一轍。以牙對牙，雖爲兩敗俱傷之下，但其翼翅又折，左右齊失，其攻勢之銳減，將成鐵定事實。即決無能如我所言之理想，偶有所失，當所難免。可退後再事硏討，右後衛用吳祺祥。吳近來恢復顚峯，八面成風，最理想之人物矣。故萬一V蘇若在譚福積失算之下、亦斷難望再越吳祺祥之一關也。左後衛還是李天生，旣周吳祺祥較爲合作，而守門亦當用劉難漢，則與祺祥天生更可收默契之效。如此之論，守衛綫上，各個俱有緊凑之戰責，合力阻銳利之葡商鋒綫，精彩鐘頭，旗鼓相當，必大有可觀。</p>
<p>理想陣容</p>
<p>最末要談鋒綫。則我見與必賢君相同。觀乎首戰，再環觀目下狀况，許文奎戴麟經旣以傷，近期內難望出塲。賈幼良右翼，韓龍海右鋒，李義臣中鋒，孫錦順左鋒，李垚之左翼，均有所擅長。對方守衛固佳，可望擊破，總之，此陣容雖爲一得之見，然於精於理，不失爲衆望所歸之大衆意思。筆者自認爲標球迷，十餘年來，每逢較好之球賽，無塲不到，且與一般球迷間周旋，縱談所及，興趣自濃。唯歷來素鮮於執筆，此番因鑒於中華隊在如此人材衆多之際，不能好事利用，良用感慨，故欣爲之再作硏討，以實本報。文拙之處，則不計矣，惟不堪識者一笑。於是我希望於中葡盃第二戰中華之陣容，擬就如下。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Army Alert to Enemy Movements, Standing Firmly in the Philippines: Enemy Fleet Discovered West of Luzon <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft on the 5th, an enemy transport fleet of about 100 landing craft, under the cover of a mobile force, appeared in the waters west of Lingayen Gulf in Luzon. Furthermore, a powerful enemy transport fleet, based on about ten or more standard aircraft carriers, is cruising in the waters west of Panay Island. In addition, a powerful enemy transport fleet is advancing westward south of Negros Island. Due to the enemy's new plans, especially the attempt to land on Luzon, the situation in the Philippines is extremely critical. Japanese army units in the area are closely monitoring the movements of the enemy and standing ready for battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 4th that an enemy fleet, based on about 30 transport ships, entered the Sulu Sea from the Mindanao Sea. At around 7:30 AM on the 3rd, it was fiercely attacked by Japanese kamikaze special attack forces in the Mindanao Sea. Two large transport ships of the enemy were sunk, and one destroyer was destroyed. Despite these losses, the enemy is desperately trying to break through the Japanese blockade. By dawn on the 4th, they had invaded San Jose. At the same time, an enemy mobile force, based on four aircraft carriers providing cover for the fleet, invaded the waters west of Panay Island, to the right of Mindoro Island, on the afternoon of the 4th. Three planes from the Japanese army's special attack unit, "One Sincerity Squadron," each attacked a ship, sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and two battleships or cruisers. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft from the covering fighter squadron crashed itself, and two did not return. Japanese air forces and special attack aircraft teams are currently continuing their fierce attacks on these enemy fleets and mobile forces. In addition, the Japanese air forces in the Philippines are actively attacking enemy fleets and mobile forces advancing into Japanese positions and are continuously and thoroughly hindering the enemy's base operations in Mindoro and Leyte day and night. Following the attacks on enemy airfields in San Jose and Tacloban on the 2nd and 3rd, the Japanese air force launched continuous attacks on Mindoro and Leyte from the night of the 2nd to dawn on the 4th. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 5th, seventeen fires and two explosions were caused in San Jose on Mindoro Island, and ten fires and two explosions were caused at the enemy airfield in Tacloban, Leyte, as well as one fire at the airfield in Dulag. In this operation, eight Japanese aircraft did not return. Although enemy aircraft have been subjected to unified bombing and attacks by Japanese air and land forces, there are still 300 enemy aircraft on Leyte and 50 or 60 small aircraft on Mindoro Island. As the Philippine battle is gradually intensifying, Britain is paying close attention to its movements. In order to contain the Philippine battle, its East Indies Fleet, a mobile force mainly composed of two or three aircraft carriers, appeared in the waters northwest of Sumatra on the 4th. Eighty of its carrier-based aircraft attacked northern Sumatra on the afternoon of the 4th. The Japanese air forces in that area immediately engaged them in a fierce counterattack, shooting down a total of 26 aircraft by dusk. There is still potential for the battle results to expand, while Japanese damage is extremely minimal. Meanwhile, a powerful enemy mobile force attacked Taiwan on the 3rd and 4th and is still cruising in the waters northeast of the island. Currently, the Philippine war has expanded to the seas near Taiwan. The enemy's will to fight a decisive battle in the Philippines and the Indian Ocean is still very strong.

<p>Shonan, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, issued the following statement to commemorate the second anniversary of the Republic of China's National Government's participation in the war: As the second anniversary of the Republic of China's National Government's participation in the war approaches, I, on behalf of all peace-loving and freedom-loving Indians and the Provisional Government of India, express my deepest congratulations. Under the unyielding spirit of the great Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the guidance of the late President Wang, the only successor to the Father of the Nation, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States two years ago. To drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia and to liberate the nations of East Asia from the shackles of terrifying British and American imperialism, the National Government resolutely joined hands with Japan and other nations of East Asia to participate in this large-scale operation. The two years of the National Government's participation in the war and the events that have taken place have further convinced the National Government and other East Asian countries that Japan's destruction of the military forces of Britain and the United States is based on justice and truth. The National Government's participation in the war is not only for the liberation and unification of China but also for the liberation of all countries in East Asia, which is why it joined this great holy war.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:40 PM on the 6th: Seventy to eighty B-29 aircraft from the Chinese side attacked the western part of Kyushu from the clouds, blindly bombing. Japanese damage was extremely minimal. Investigation of the battle results is currently underway.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The air raid on Japan's Kyushu by enemy B-29 aircraft from bases in mainland China marks the first such attack since the beginning of the new year on the 19th of last month. This attack has a strong implication of reflecting the new developments in the Philippine battle. On that day, enemy aircraft approached in several waves, gradually intruding into key areas of western Kyushu from 10:00 AM onwards. However, due to dense clouds and falling snowflakes, some of the enemy aircraft were unable to enter key areas and retreated midway, while the bombing by other enemy aircraft was entirely blind. As a result, Japanese damage was extremely minimal, and no important facilities suffered any damage. Japanese air defense forces braved the dense clouds and snow to engage the enemy in an interception battle. The results of the battle are currently unclear.</p>

The Administration is directly under the Chongqing Government's Military Affairs Commission, directly commanding and managing all air, land, and sea transportation matters in the Chongqing area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The purpose of establishing the vital wartime transportation bureau is to find ways to open the Ledo Road and the Burma Road. According to an Associated Press report from Chongqing, the new director, Yu Feipeng, declared during a meeting with reporters on the 3rd that even if the Sino-Indian Highway is opened, it will be entirely a military-use road, and civilian transport will be absolutely prohibited. This completely dashed the hopes of the people under Chongqing's rule for the expectation of various materials, which was one glimmer of hope from the opening of this highway. Yu Feipeng stated that the technical aspects of the newly established wartime transportation bureau will be handled by a large number of Americans. If the Sino-Indian Highway is opened, an important task will be to transport supplies to Chongqing for the Americans.

<h3 id="e14">Who is the Leader of the Chinese Revolution (Part 2) <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Shayu</p>
<p>Q: You said that the bureaucrats and scholar-officials who opposed Kang Youwei at the time were not "imperialist running dogs." Then, why did the Chinese intellectuals, led by Sun Wen, rise up in revolution and oppose them?</p>
<p>A: The Manchu Qing Dynasty, in order to protect its own position, originally intended to resist the invasion of foreign imperialism. However, the Manchu Qing knew that it was impossible to wage a war against foreign imperialism head-on. Therefore, it failed to declare a full-scale war of resistance against foreign powers with a firm and resolute attitude. As a result, when Chinese bureaucrats and people clashed with foreign imperialism, the Manchu Qing government secretly encouraged and incited them, but when the situation became unfavorable, it pretended not to know and shirked responsibility. Consequently, parts of land and sovereignty were handed over to foreign imperialists with both hands. The Manchu Qing's overall attitude of compromise and weakness towards foreign imperialism aroused the people with a sense of national conscience, especially the intellectuals. Therefore, Gu Hongming defended the Manchu Qing on the one hand, and explained the Xinhai Revolution on the other, saying: "The reason for the outbreak of this revolution is not to oppose a corrupt government, but to oppose a weak government, that is, to oppose a weak government. The real motive of this revolution does not lie in the Han people's hatred of the Manchus. The factor that gives the revolution power! Violence! is the intense rebellious sentiment aroused by the contempt and humiliation suffered by the Chinese from foreigners. All those who believe in this educated Boxer Movement (Tis Learning boxer movent, referring to the Xinhai Revolution, Yoshida note) think so. As long as we are Chinese, we are despised by foreigners, because we have a pigtail on our heads. We suffer such contempt and humiliation from foreigners, and in fact, the Manchu Qing should bear this responsibility. Therefore, the revolutionaries hate the Manchu Qing and advocate the elimination of all Manchu Qing styles in Chinese territory. As the wise Putnam Weale said, in the current 'revolution to cut off pigtails,' there is a world of pathos (A World of Pathos). In short, the reason for the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 was a flawed national self-esteem, and the reason for the outbreak of the current revolution is national vanity." (The Story of a Chinese Oxford Movement By Ku Hung-ming. P. 124).</p>
<p>Gu Hongming was indeed a world-renowned critic in the late Manchu Qing Dynasty, but his political ideology was that of a royalist. He was Zhang Zhidong's secretary for a long time and was raised by the Manchu Qing's salary for many years, so naturally he could only understand the essence of the Xinhai Revolution in this way. It is true that the Chinese people rose up in anger because they hated the Manchu Qing's weakness and incompetence towards foreign imperialism, but the Manchu Qing government itself cannot escape the responsibility for its weakness and incompetence. For example, what role did the bureaucrats, the most important pillars of the Manchu Qing government, objectively play? When bureaucrats realized that the Manchu Qing could not create a defense against foreign imperialist aggression, they adopted a "defeatist" mentality and engaged in compromising and surrendering to foreign imperialists, while at the same time using foreign power to reorganize the Manchu Qing's political pressure on Chinese peasants. Bureaucrats consolidated the Manchu Qing government in this way, and at the same time, they colluded with foreign imperialists, not only to simply exploit the peasant masses, but also to plan to organize more profitable modernized industries. Therefore, in the context of the Manchu Qing gradually giving Chinese sovereignty to foreign imperialism, such as ceding territory, demarcating concessions, transferring railway management rights and customs, and abandoning the right to autonomous taxation and civil and criminal law rights for foreigners in Chinese territory, the bureaucrats who accepted and handled these treaties of national humiliation also participated in the work of foreign imperialists dividing up China. Such bureaucrats gradually changed from loyal subjects of the Manchu Qing to loyal subjects of foreign imperialism. As a result, in the eyes of the Chinese people, all officials, big and small, of the Manchu Qing government were running dogs of foreign powers who sold out the interests of the Chinese people. And the majority of the Chinese people were Han Chinese, and the main part of the running dogs of foreign powers were Manchus, so the slogan "Revive the Han and oppose the Manchus" deeply touched the hearts of the people. Gu Hongming, who was himself a Manchu Qing bureaucrat, naturally did not notice such an essential change that had taken place in the Manchu Qing bureaucrats. Therefore, his view of the Xinhai Revolution was the same as that of Putnam Weale: "The reason why the revolution to cut off pigtails broke out now is due to the worship of national vanity." If there was no this revolution, frankly speaking, the Xinhai Revolution would not have been launched because of national vanity. We could not have skipped the era of "as long as you are Chinese, you will be despised by foreigners." In order to fight against foreign imperialism, China must first modernize. In order to modernize, the rulers of China must first modernize. If the rulers of China are unwilling to modernize and instead hinder China's modernization, then this group of rulers must be eliminated and replaced with rulers who lead China towards modernization. Unfortunately, the movement of Kang Youwei and others failed, which proves that the Manchu Qing government itself was unwilling to modernize and instead hindered China's modernization. The Manchu Qing government not only did not give up the feudal exploitation of the Chinese peasant masses, but also joined hands with foreign imperialism in an attempt to further strengthen the previous exploitative relationship. Thus, the Xinhai Revolution came into being. If viewed from the perspective of anti-feudalism alone, it is clear that the Xinhai Revolution can be said to be a continuation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. At that time, the position of the Manchu Qing government was just like the position of the shogunate that advocated "opening the ports" and opposed "revering the emperor and expelling the barbarians" during the Meiji Restoration. Objectively, both of them wanted to lead wolves into the house and open a wide road for foreign imperialists to invade their country, and they were feudal remnants who could not complete the modernization of themselves and their country. This is why China's national revolution movement did not appear in the form of a monarchical reform movement, but in the form of a thorough destructive movement.</p>
<p>Q: You said that the Xinhai Revolution was launched by intellectuals representing the political interests of Chinese national capitalists. However, the collusion between Chinese national capitalists and bureaucrats is quite deep-rooted. How could they become the main force against the bureaucrats?</p>
<p>A: Under the Manchu Qing government, bureaucrats, landlords, commercial capitalists, and usurers colluded with each other to form a four-in-one feudal exploitative system. These people sometimes had conflicts of interest and quarreled with each other on certain issues, but on fundamental issues, such as the peasant problem, they were always consistent and unified. Just like the four countries of Britain, Prussia, Russia, and Austria, who were constantly quarreling in the early 19th century, formed a united front of the "Holy Alliance" against revolutionary France. However, later, Britain, the most advanced capitalist country at that time, withdrew from the Holy Alliance and shook hands with revolutionary France. Similarly, under the Manchu Qing government, the national capitalists were the ones who withdrew from the "four-in-one" of feudal exploitation and shook hands with the "revolutionary France" of China. To be more specific, Chinese national capitalists were by no means naturally transformed from the commercial capital and usurious capital accumulated from the feudal exploitative system, like a pupa transforming into a moth in a normal relationship. The above-mentioned "four-in-one" of Manchu Qing feudal exploitation were all subordinate to foreign imperialism and played a comprador role to varying degrees. Therefore, when national capital developed from commercial capital and usurious capital gradually tried to start the original activities of capitalism, it already knew that due to foreign imperialist aggression against China, its activities were encountering obstacles everywhere. Important domestic industries (such as railways) were almost entirely in the hands of foreign capitalists, and the "four-in-one" of feudal exploitative relations all colluded with foreign capitalists and were always unwilling to form partnerships with national capitalists. Thus, national capitalists were eager to find partners around them. First, they encountered intellectuals. There were two types of intellectuals, one was the old-style intellectuals who wanted to become bureaucrats and aristocrats but failed. The Kang Youwei faction belonged to this category. Old-style intellectuals, that is, the scholar-official class, became bureaucrats and aristocrats based on their "imperial examination" results. However, when "selling official titles" became an open secret in the late Manchu Qing Dynasty, the prestige of the "imperial examination" had long been plummeted and completely bankrupt, and it was actually very difficult for the poor scholar-official class to become officials in the Manchu Qing government. Therefore, there were also many "dissidents" among the old-style intellectuals who opposed the Manchu Qing government. Some of them participated in the revolution, just as Lafayette and Mirabeau, and other figures from the aristocratic class, also participated in the revolution to overthrow the Bourbon dynasty during the French Revolution. The other type of intellectuals are the modern intellectuals who have received foreign (especially Japanese and American) education, comparing the lives of the American people with the lives of the Chinese people. Thus, this group of people understood how the people under the rule of the Manchu Qing, especially the peasants, were groaning under the iron hooves of feudal exploitative relations, and how they were being stripped of all their freedom under the tyranny of the autocratic demon king. They understood that Japan, which was also Asian, had driven out foreign imperialism, and how the country had made great progress in a short period of time. Japan overthrew the ruling forces that hindered Japan's modernization -- the shogunate. And established a modern government that absorbed foreign culture and could guarantee independence and freedom without injury. Then, a large amount of foreign culture was imported. As a result, this small Asian country was able to defeat a major European power in 1906. This fact greatly encouraged Chinese modern intellectuals. They thought that as long as the corrupt Manchu Qing was overthrown, China could at least achieve eight times the national power of Japan with a population of 50 million. These two comparisons, after being sorted out in Sun Yat-sen's mind, became the foundation of the Three Principles of the People. Rather than calling the Three Principles of the People a revolutionary theory, it is more accurate to say that it is a revolutionary thought narrated with revolutionary enthusiasm. Don't forget that it was precisely because the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary theory was ambiguous that it was most suitable for guiding the entirely complex and varied revolutionary camps at that time. Some theorists criticize Sun Yat-sen's thought for lacking a clear revolutionary theory, but these people have not noticed that only an ambiguous theory can guide the complex and intricate Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<p>Firstly, what the bourgeoisie wanted to contact was the peasants who directly opposed the feudal "four-in-one." The peasants' struggle against landlords and against usurious capital ultimately meant a struggle against the Manchu Qing, which was also a struggle against imperialism. The bourgeoisie wanted to guide this force of peasant struggle onto the track of revolution. Therefore, the Declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, which truly inherited the tradition of the Xinhai Revolution, clearly pointed out: "Resist imperialism and warlords, oppose special classes that are unfavorable to peasants and workers, and seek the liberation of peasants and workers." However, during the Xinhai Revolution, workers had not yet become an independent and conscious class.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there were the warlords and soldiers. In the late Manchu Qing Dynasty, military officers who maintained local security became semi-independent warlords. They treated soldiers as their own private property and treated the area they maintained security in as their own private territory. Most of them had long lost the concept of being loyal to the Manchu Qing. And most of the soldiers under their command were peasants who had lost their land. The reason why they became soldiers was that the warlords could guarantee their food, clothing, and shelter. The warlords and soldiers were all furious and resentful of the invasion of foreign imperialism and expressed great dissatisfaction with the current situation in China. Therefore, they easily accepted the propaganda of the revolutionaries and became partners in the revolution. For this reason, Li Yuanhong, who was so frightened during the Xinhai Revolution that he crawled under the bed in a state of panic, sent the following letter to Yuan Shikai as soon as he calmed down: "The national treasury and the national army are the foundation of the empire. Both of these are in the hands of the ignorant and weak Manchu party. Look at the property and lives of the 400 million Chinese people being controlled by a small number of Manchus. How can you be at peace..." If we understand that Li Yuanhong was one of the "most progressive soldiers" who had received Japanese education at that time, we will never think that this statement was written under the coercion of revolutionaries.</p>
<p>In short, the Xinhai Revolution was produced by the union of various strata dissatisfied with the corruption of the Manchu Qing. The leadership of the national capitalists and their political representatives, the Sun Yat-sen faction, in this united camp was by no means strong and powerful. Therefore, not long after the Xinhai Revolution, until Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, the leadership of the bourgeoisie in the revolutionary camp was often almost overthrown by other strata in the same camp. Sun Yat-sen had a full of enthusiasm for saving China from the abyss and opposing the invasion of imperialism, so he was always supported by the Chinese people. This is also one of the reasons why Sun Yat-sen failed in several revolutions but was still able to make a comeback. (Translated by Jing)</p>

<p>The 9th of this month marks the second anniversary of China's participation in the war. At a time when the war has entered a decisive stage, the Allied forces are winning victories and good news is frequently reported. All sectors of the city will hold a "Shanghai Citizen Victory Celebration Rally to Commemorate the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War." Under the auspices of the Municipal Propaganda Office, representatives of various institutions and organizations gathered the day before yesterday and held a preparatory meeting in the conference room of the Municipal Government. It was decided that the location of the conference would be the Grand Theater, and the time would be from 9:00 am to 12:00 noon. It is estimated that more than 3,000 representatives from various institutions, public organizations, military police, Baojia, and youth will participate. Important programs include reading the National Government's Declaration of War Participation, a speech by Secretary-General Zhao of the National Defense Council, a speech by Staff Officer Xiong of the Security Office, Principal Jiang of the Naval Academy, Minister Matsudaira of the Allied News Department, and other speeches, as well as sending a telegram to pay tribute to Chairman Chen on behalf of the city, reading a telegram of condolence to the soldiers on the front lines, and other items.

<p>The First Brigade of Youth and Adolescents in the Sixth District has been training in Caohejing, Longcao Township, for a month. Recently, due to the rampant gambling in Xin Longhua, near the brigade headquarters, which has persisted for years and primarily involves notorious gamblers known as "Yellow Hats" and "Black Hats," the brigade, to fulfill their responsibilities as youth and adolescents and for the betterment of the public, will first conduct persuasion efforts. Following this, dozens of brigade members will be dispatched to suppress gambling. Chen Guisheng, the owner of the gambling den, has voluntarily pledged to never again profit from gambling. It is also reported that the brigade headquarters will petition the district league headquarters to forward the request to the Sixth District Police Bureau to assist the brigade in jointly eradicating widespread gambling throughout the Sixth District.</p>

<h3 id="e22">"Youth Are the Pioneers" <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>May Everyone Fulfill the Responsibility of Cherishing and Nurturing Them</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Youth are the pioneers!" This is because young people are vigorous and unafraid of difficulties, forging ahead with courage. Moreover, as they are new to society, they are untainted by bad habits, possess pure hearts, and hold fervent enthusiasm for public affairs. Therefore, they tackle tasks with bravery and initiative, embodying the spirit of "pioneers." Considering the 5,000 students aided by this newspaper, are they not all outstanding students from impoverished backgrounds? Are they not all diligent and studious young people? The saying "It takes a hundred years to grow a person" actually takes only ten to twenty years to enable them to serve society and the nation. In other words, they are all future "pioneers," but currently, they are hindered by their circumstances and need the dedicated support of enthusiastic individuals to fulfill the responsibility of cherishing and nurturing them. Contribute money as you can, the more the better. This is a matter for the entire society. It is hoped that everyone will embrace a sense of "inescapable duty" to contribute to this great movement.</p>
<p>Chongshi Middle School Enthusiastically Raises Funds</p>
<p>A letter from Chongshi Elementary and Middle School states: "To whom it may concern, since our school's faculty and students began the 'Rescue Students from Dropping Out' campaign on December 27th of last year, we have been honored by the support of students' parents and the concern of enthusiastic individuals in society. As of January 4th of this year, we have raised a total of 2,297,220 yuan. After deliberation by the faculty and students, we have decided to retain 1,155,920 yuan as a scholarship fund for underprivileged students at our school. The remaining funds will be distributed proportionally based on the number of students aided by our school in the two newspapers. We will send 751,300 yuan to the News Daily's Social Services Department, and the remaining 390,000 yuan is being delivered by our student representatives Ye Bangdian, Wang Lilin, and Gu Shiyi. This is but a drop in the bucket, a small contribution, but we are doing our best. We hope that you will accept it and publish this letter and the list of fundraising team members in your newspaper, for which we will be deeply grateful."</p>

<p>A letter from Chen Daozong of Xincheng Printing House states: "To whom it may concern, for your esteemed 8th scholarship fund, I solicited donations from various friends, and I am grateful for their enthusiastic support, totaling 32,000 yuan. I also received support of 1,000 yuan from Fuxing Machinery Oil Company and others, making a total of 57,000 yuan. I am enclosing it with this letter, and I hope you will accept it. Furthermore, as I am engaged in the printing business, I am also a member of the cultural community. This small amount is merely a token of my contribution. As Shanghai is the national cultural center, there are many of us in the printing industry. If we could be inspired and rise up, the amount would be considerable. It is hoped that the leaders and giants of our industry will take the lead and call upon us."</p>

<h3 id="e23">Anecdotes from Two Grand Gatherings <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>...On the afternoon of the 5th, the Shanghai Five Groups Tea Party welcomed Acting Chairman Chen, and on the afternoon of the 6th, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association hosted a tea party for all sectors. The former was held on the 11th floor of the Cathay Mansions on Changle Road, and the latter was held on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. These two tea parties can be said to be the two major events since the New Year, embellishing the New Year scene.</p>
<p>...At both tea parties, the attendees were all well-known figures from all walks of life in Shanghai, with senior government officials and dignitaries gathering together. At the tea party welcoming Acting Chairman Chen, detectives were stationed around the entrance of Cathay Mansions, preventing passersby from approaching. There were an especially large number of cars carrying government officials with official passes.</p>
<p>...Acting Chairman Chen arrived promptly at 4 o'clock, punctual to the minute. He wore a new National Suit, with a leather-collared overcoat. He was physically strong and energetic. Two plainclothes bodyguards accompanied him. Minister Ding Mocun and Secretary-General Wu Songgao, dressed in blue robes and mandarin jackets, were gentle scholars. Minister Lin Baisheng wore a National Suit, leather boots, and had a shaved head, befitting the spirit of the leader of the Youth League. Director Xiong Jiandong wore a military uniform with a sword, draped in a cloak, embodying the essence of a soldier.</p>
<p>...The four elders Li, Wen, Yuan, and Lin, representing the five groups, as well as Chen, the president of this newspaper, as hosts, were all dressed in robes and jackets, warmly welcoming guests. The only female guest was Ms. Qu Zhonglun. A gentleman carrying an extra-large leather bag attracted the most attention.</p>
<p>...Acting Chairman Chen's speech was very modest, but his words were extremely powerful. In it, he quoted Mr. Wang's ten years of "selflessness for the country's sake," and when he spoke of the hardship of his circumstances, tears welled up in his eyes, moving the audience. When he spoke of inheriting Mr. Wang's spirit, and that as long as it was beneficial to national unification, he would sacrifice everything, and responsibly guarantee it to the people of the nation, he raised his voice, excited and impassioned.</p>
<p>...The groups presented Mayor Chen with a large silver cup, engraved with the words "Shanghai Citizens' Affection," which, including the wooden frame, was almost as tall as a person. The value of this silver cup today could have perhaps built a 2,000-ton ship ten years ago.</p>
<p>...During the speeches by the representatives of the presidential group, when they mentioned the need to strictly prohibit extortion and crack down on Black Hats, wise people nodded in agreement. When they spoke of eradicating corruption and eliminating profiteering, perhaps the minds of some people trembled.</p>
<p>...At the Shanghai District Tea Party of the China News Association, the hosts wore red flower ribbons on their chests, warmly receiving guests, seemingly full of joy. A central tiger attracted the most attention, tiring out the photographers. Among those present were Allied Major General 森, Naval Attaché 松岛, Minister 松平 from the Embassy, President Takashima Kikujiro of the Central China Revitalization Company, as well as the newly appointed Governor of Anhui Province, Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Wu Songgao, Li Zanlao, and Wen Lanlao. Yuan Lülao was on another table, discussing the price changes over the past decades. Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's attitude was elegant, and he spoke very little. Many Allied reporters and press figures offered congratulations, among whom Lieutenant 盐田, in his navy blue uniform, long sword at his waist, and black cloak, was most distinguished.</p>
<p>...The atmosphere at the tea party welcoming Acting Chairman Chen and the Shanghai District Tea Party of the China News Association was quite different. The former was solemn and quiet, with a pin drop silence; the latter was full of harmonious atmosphere, with no speeches, everyone occupying a seat, talking loudly, and laughter occasionally breaking out, as if it were a family gathering.

<h3 id="e28">The Longer the War, the Greater the Enemy's Consumption: Captain Shioda Analyzes the Battlefield <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>In the Philippines campaign, the Japanese army is already assured of victory, as evidenced by recent triumphant news, which is especially evident. Captain Shioda of the Naval Press Department recently analyzed the situation, stating: The recent offensives by the enemy's American mobile forces in Mindoro and Taiwan are, in fact, a manifestation of their last ounce of strength. The American forces that landed on Leyte Island number approximately 150,000, while those in Mindoro are about 20,000 to 30,000. The supply bases for General MacArthur's troops are Palau Island, the eastern base of New Guinea, and even more distant Australia. As for Nimitz's base, it is Hawaii. Due to the length and distance of the supply lines, maintaining them is fraught with difficulty. Without sufficient naval and army strength in preparation, failure is inevitable. However, considering America's manpower and production capacity, the Americans are currently in extreme pain. The battles of Mindoro and Taiwan are already manifestations of the American forces' last strength. It is impossible for General MacArthur to occupy all the cities in the Philippines. Exerting all their strength, they can only occupy a few points in a vast area. The strength of the Japanese army, on the other hand, is increasing daily. The longer the war continues, the greater the pain for the American forces, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>Enemy Seeks Aid after Naval Defeats</p>
<p>Regarding naval operations, after repeated naval defeats, Nimitz has appealed to the Netherlands and France in Europe for assistance, intending to use the forces they gather to attack the Philippines and Taiwan. If this naval force consisted of large warships, it might still be able to put on a show. However, in reality, this so-called assembled fleet is quite weak. Even if concentrated, it would be powerless. Regardless of the inconsistencies in its speed and combat capabilities, command issues would arise. Even if this motley crew could be entirely transported to the Pacific, it would be vulnerable to a single blow. Its only service would be to protect the enemy's transportation routes. It goes without saying that the enemy's American command is encountering various difficulties. As the enemy's American command has said, although the United Nations claims to be at war with Japan, in reality, it is not the entire organization, but only America alone. Furthermore, they say that war against Japan inevitably involves various losses. Therefore, their inner feelings about fighting in the Pacific are understandable.</p>
<p>Japanese Power is Immense</p>
<p>Conversely, Japan, in its operations in the Philippines, has a large number of transport ships and large vessels that can be used to supply its troops. Since the opening of the battle on Leyte Island, Japan has been fully prepared for the joint increase in land and naval forces in the Philippines. From now on, the enemy will inevitably suffer many losses and even exhaust its strength, inflicting a fatal blow. Japan's air force is also utilizing the latest types of aircraft to exert maximum power. The enemy's mobile force's strength is extremely weak, especially its attack methods, which are very weak. Although the enemy uses its remaining fleet to try to prevent the concentration of Japanese forces, its efforts are in vain, and these plans are useless. In summary, in order to cover up the weakness of its defeat, the enemy may attempt landings elsewhere in the future. However, there are many islands, so the location of its landings cannot be predicted, but Mindanao or Luzon Island seem to be within the realm of possibility. With the Philippines established, no matter where the enemy lands, it will be met head-on by the Japanese army, so there is no need to worry. Moreover, Japan's powerful air force will surely be able to exert its supreme power and obtain a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>The Enemy Attempts a Quick Victory</p>
<p>The enemy has repeatedly suffered from Japan's attrition warfare, and the magnitude of its losses goes without saying. From an operational standpoint, the strength of infantry is far less than the power of air bases. Therefore, if the enemy invades, the consumption it suffers will be even greater. In particular, the army and navy special attack teams will inflict irreparable losses on the enemy, like a hurricane sweeping away fallen leaves. Today (6th), the Japanese headquarters announced that the Japanese special attack aircraft team on Mindoro Island sank two enemy transport ships. On average, each transport ship has a crew of 1,000 people, so 2,000 people have been buried in the belly of the fish. Another special attack team sank two enemy aircraft carriers and one battleship in the sea west of Luzon Island. These aircraft carriers are auxiliary-class, with a crew of approximately 3,000 people, while the medium-sized battleship has 1,100 people. The Japanese special attack team involved in this operation had only six aircraft, yet it inflicted such great losses on the enemy. In terms of personnel alone, it annihilated more than 5,100 enemy soldiers. In such a scene of attrition warfare, the enormity of America's losses is clearly evident, and the consumption of its national power is even more obvious. Therefore, the longer the war continues, the greater America's consumption. America's desire to use a quick victory in its war against Japan lies in this reason. After repeated defeats, the enemy can only use Sumatra or the air force in China and Saipan, and even expand its air base on the Aleutian Islands to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland. However, such actions are only a manifestation of the enemy's anxiousness in the war. In short, the Philippine battle is truly a key battle in the Greater East Asia War, and the Japanese military and civilians alike hold firm to their belief in victory and calmly cope with the situation.</p>
<p>Philippine People's Self-Defense Organization</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Presidents Laurel and Aquino, the independence movement of the Philippine people is surging and progressing rapidly. With Japan's support, much has been achieved in the establishment of a new government, and its effectiveness is especially evident. However, those who seek to undermine this independence movement are sparing no effort to devastate it through guerilla warfare. If they use Mindoro and Leyte Islands as bases for resistance and divide the Philippines into ten war zones, the various places will inevitably be disturbed, but the Japanese army is determined to blockade them and defeat them one by one. The day of annihilation is not far off.</p>
<p>America is making every effort to retake the Philippines and is eager to get the Filipinos to help. Although its operational methods are varied, its attack on Leyte Island uses local guerrillas and hopes that after obtaining a base on Leyte, it can seize the Filipinos and make them cooperate. This is very obvious. However, things have gone against their wishes. What they hoped for has turned out to be the opposite. In the Philippines, with Manila as the center, large and small places have exceptionally strengthened their people's self-defense organizations, and the security network is everywhere. Therefore, the success of the guerrillas that America hopes for will ultimately be a bubble. This kind of civil self-defense organization is firmly rooted, and although America launches air raids from time to time, it cannot move it in the slightest. Since September, the enemy has repeatedly carried out large-scale bombing, but the people's hearts are strong, and there is no sign of wavering, which is very comforting. Although the damage under the air raids is not light, the production movement centered on food and construction is progressing without end, and the damage suffered is gradually being recovered. The so-called production movement does not refer to one place or one area but is a widespread phenomenon in various places, self-sufficient and deeply rooted, it can be asserted.</p>
<p>Kamikaze Corps Members Are Disciplined</p>
<p>Recently, a visitor from the Philippines said: Recently, a very large number of Japanese air force members hope to join the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, almost all of them. The corps members all have the greatest determination and regard assimilation as going home, and they are especially admirable for their strict adherence to discipline. It is said that one day, a group of Kamikaze corps members gathered together, preparing to depart, but somehow they accidentally knocked over an oil lamp, and in an instant, flames blazed. The corps members unwittingly clapped their hands loudly, thinking it was a joke. At that time, a certain second lieutenant, who was very young, heard the news and rushed over, tightly instructing the corps members to remain calm and not to have any carelessness. The Kamikaze corps members have dedicated themselves to the country, and even in this moment before death, they must not be the slightest bit lax in discipline. The strictness of the military on weekdays can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e29">One Aspect of the Internal Discord in Chongqing-Communist Relations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Kuan</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's broadcast on New Year's Day this year broke the usual practice by not mentioning international relations at all, but only appealing to the people to focus on concrete measures for resistance and reconstruction, which attracted public attention. But at the same time, this has become the "target of public criticism" from all levels. Those who truly love the country and are worried about China's future must carefully read Chiang's speech, savor its content, and explore China's viable path and Chiang's inner thoughts. As a result, the conclusion reached is: "Is Chiang's guiding principle truly the right path to save China? And the public's criticisms can be roughly divided into two: those who still trust Chiang, or those who feel greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>The CCP's criticism is part of the people's voice, and we need to listen to it. Since Yan'an and Chongqing are in opposing political positions, and there are many new and old grudges in terms of ideology, politics, and military affairs, the criticism of Chiang is inevitably filled with emotional abuse, which we must consider. However, Yan'an often stands on the side of the people and says what the people want to say, which is not entirely unfounded. Yan'an's broadcast on the 4th of this month had extremely sharp criticism of Chiang's speech, pointing out Chiang's contradictions and deceptions to the best of its ability, but in its malicious words, we can also find some points that are not without reason. For example, it says:</p>
<p>"The greatest crisis Chiang Kai-shek spoke of last year stemmed from the Kuomintang's defeatist fascist policy, but it made society responsible for it. It also claimed that because the public's burden was not enough, it had a great impact on the army's morale and combat behavior, which was also the responsibility of society. And the government's self-criticism only claimed that wartime administration was not thorough enough. Just pointing out this point, the public's hatred of Chiang Kai-shek's oligarchy can be imagined."</p>
<p>How much hatred there is, let's put that aside for now, but Chiang is forcing the people to sacrifice and endure any harsh demands in order to get through this year, demanding that landlords and the rich provide money and food, which is a matter of life and death for the exhausted people. To further strengthen the war burden that has been accelerating for the past eight years, and at the same time to take responsibility for defeat for others, no matter what kind of people, they cannot help but complain.</p>
<p>Secondly, Yan'an thoroughly exposed the deception of Chiang's promise that "as long as the military situation is stable and the foundation for counter-offensive is established, the constitution will be promulgated and power will be returned to the people." It said:</p>
<p>"Chiang Kai-shek's statement assumes that the Chinese people have no memory, but in fact our memory is very good. We know that the constitution should have been implemented on February 10, 1934, and we have not forgotten the Kuomintang's promises to convene the National Assembly and implement constitutional government on November 12, 1936, November 1937, and November 12, 1940. And we have also heard the agreement to implement constitutional government within one year after the end of the war. Moreover, many of these agreements were made before the start of the war. At that time, was the convening of the National Assembly not actually a military crisis that made it difficult? Then why was it not convened as scheduled?"</p>
<p>Then, regarding the phrase "as long as the military situation is stable and the foundation for counter-offensive is established," it retorted as follows:</p>
<p>"In the past seven and a half years, the military situation has not been as bad as it is now. Then when will the military situation be stable and the foundation for counter-offensive be established? Although Chiang Kai-shek often said that final victory is absolutely guaranteed, he suddenly issued a statement to the world in January 1945 that final victory was not guaranteed. In the past, there was a date for convening the National Assembly, but today's agreement does not specify a date, and there is so little confidence in the stability of the military situation and the establishment of a counter-offensive foundation."</p>
<p>After Yan'an vehemently criticized Chiang's empty promises, it raised practical questions, asking whether the content of the National Assembly was the same as before the war, or whether new representatives would be elected? And it raised questions about how to elect local representatives during the war, and who would preside over the meeting, etc.</p>
<p>Yan'an's accusations touched Chiang's sore spots. The sign that the promise of constitutional government, which was brought out as a magic weapon to mobilize the people to continue the war, was contrary to Chiang's true intentions was exposed without a doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Key to Victory in the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Wenyue</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has already entered the decisive stage, and final victory will definitely belong to us, which can be affirmed with great certainty. In the initial stage of the war, the allied nations used surprise attacks and tactical assaults to frighten the enemy, laying the foundation for victory. In the full-scale war stage, the allied nations developed resources, increased their war power, and implemented a war of attrition, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Its final victory is of course without question. But why will the enemy inevitably be defeated, and why will Greater East Asia inevitably win? The main keys are specially described below:</p>
<p>(1) Political: The Greater East Asia War is a war of righteousness against injustice. The enemy is invading East Asia, which is unjust. The allied nations are seeking East, which is just. A just cause is strong, and an unjust cause is weak. The enemy is using an unjust army, so how can it not be defeated in the end?</p>
<p>(2) Psychological: This war is one of harmony on one side and discord on the other. In the enemy, although it is called united, in reality, they sleep in the same bed but dream different dreams, united but not knowing. In the allied nations, there is unity from top to bottom, and common hatred of the enemy. At the same time, we are also supporting the entire nation of Greater East Asia, creating a great unity of 1 billion people in Greater East Asia. As the saying goes, "Victory lies in harmony." With this kind of harmonious power, the front and rear are working together, and the final victory is in our hands.</p>
<p>(3) Spiritual: The spirit of the allied nations is as strong as a panda, and the spirit of the enemy is shrinking. The enemy has soldiers with self-deprecating morale and no spirit of sacrifice, confronting the allied nations' army with a righteous, self-disciplined, and strong spirit. Victory or defeat can be determined.</p>
<p>(4) Strategic and Tactical: The enemy's strategy and tactics are slow. In the past, the allied nations' outer-line operations were correct. Proactive inner-line operations, outer-line operations emphasize encirclement, and inner-line operations emphasize breakthrough. In the initial stage of the war, the allied nations broke through the enemy's encirclement in one fell swoop, so the enemy had to abandon the outer-line operations, the most advantageous long-term war, the encirclement war strategy, and adopt the most unfavorable active offensive strategy and the tactics of bombing with aircraft. The allied nations, on the other hand, ensured resources and turned the counter-offensive into defense, turning it into a long-term invincible state. They adopted an offensive defensive strategy and attrition tactics, greatly consuming the enemy's war power, weakening it day by day, and then annihilating the remaining enemies in one fell swoop, completing the final victory. This is the successful outcome of the allied nations' correct and superior strategies and tactics.</p>
<p>(5) Geographical: The enemy is sending troops on a long expedition, and the allied nations are waiting at ease. This situation will become more and more obvious as we reach the final decisive stage. Since ancient times, those who have exhausted their troops and launched long expeditions have never failed to be defeated, and those who have taken advantage of the terrain and waited at ease have never failed to win. Such as the campaign to conquer Russia, Napoleon's defeat, and the Russo-Japanese War, the defeat of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, are extremely obvious precedents. With the results of the past three years of war, as well as history, politics, people's hearts, the spirit of sacrifice, strategic tactics, and geographical relations, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely belong to us and will be realized soon.

<p>— Situ Wei</p>
<p>Suddenly waking up from a strange dream, in the cold, cold night, I felt a bit of the fatigue of someone who had trekked a long distance.</p>
<p>Now I can't quite remember that dream clearly. It has faded away, and it is still fading away, like an ancient ink painting—those non-existent places and non-existent characters: that small courtyard with faint sunlight, that path where cold and mottled light flowed over the pebbles, lonely sighs and soft whispers.</p>
<p>(In such a night without lights or moon, at such a time of deep thought, young people who are good at dreaming: do you think it is as easy for me to pick up a slight sense of loss—a strange sense of loss, like black coffee that has not been adequately sweetened—as it is to pick up a terrifying fantasy?)</p>
<p>I seem to be standing in a small town at twilight, listening to the sound of horses' hooves echoing through the old, long street, lonely and sadly fading away. I also seem to have lost something valuable before a long journey. I can't name it, but I clearly feel that I have lost something.</p>
<p>I miss those lost things as I miss yesterday's sunlight, as I miss my own lonely shadow.</p>
<p>—What have I lost?</p>
<p>As I thought, I lit a cigarette and exhaled the smoke into this moonless night. In the darkness, I saw a lonely little star light up in front of me, a thoughtful, melancholy eye. I also saw tangled vines crawling up from the corner of my mouth, crawling over the gentle, flickering light, revealing their milky white bodies, like ribbons and rings.</p>
<p>And I lay wistfully on the bed, staring with indifferent eyes at the high-piled darkness. Cold, cold darkness, piled all the way up to the ceiling. Staring like this at those non-existent places and non-existent characters in my memory, I know, just as I am now staring at that wisp of smoke like a ribbon and a ring in front of me. They seem to be "changing in an instant," boasting of the magnificence of life. In fact, every second they are quietly melting and fading—every second they are aging. That youth will soon fade away!</p>
<p>"The school of beautiful life is a short life," I thought as the glimmer at the end of the cigarette gradually dimmed: "The things that make people miss them are always the things that are easily lost..."</p>
<p>—But what exactly have I lost? In this cold, cold night.</p>
<p>Young people who are good at dreaming, I think you can tell me. Because in this world, there is only one thing that is lost forever when it is lost, and you also know that people never have two identical dreams.</p>

<p>— Yi Xuan</p>
<p>The sound of rain pattering, the sound of wind sighing, the cold wind enters through the cracks in the window, and in the dim light, I suddenly feel that it is already the severe winter season. My thoughts are very dull, reminiscing about old friends, what else can I think about?</p>
<h3 id="e33">Nightmare <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Stie</p>
<p>Already suffering from the clamor of daylight, it further denies me peace in my dreams. Could it be that my ark is too small to bear the disasters of the century?</p>
<p>There is no need to tear open my wounds with cold claws, nor is there any need for mockery or to ignite with phosphorus fire.</p>
<p>I randomly picked up a photo album, flipping through it page by page. Some of these familiar faces are still in a circle of happiness, while others have already weathered the storms of life. As time passes, how many faces are full of youthful innocence. However, fate has also brought them unexpected encounters.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang. On this rainy night, who would come to visit me? Perhaps it's a patient requesting a house call, but the questioning voice is familiar. Listening carefully, I rushed downstairs.</p>
<p>"Fang, long time no see! Please come upstairs." I dragged and pleaded with her to come into the room. Under the light, I almost couldn't believe she was the close friend I hadn't seen for over a year.</p>
<p>The plump cheeks and sparkling eyes had all disappeared without a trace. The Yu Fang standing before me was so haggard, thin, and lost.</p>
<p>I asked her to take off her soaked raincoat, but she shook her head in refusal. We stood in silence for a long time. She hesitated to speak several times. Overwhelmed by surprise and joy, I didn't know where to begin.</p>
<p>She flipped through the photo album. I stared blankly at the rainwater dripping from her, my thoughts gathering like raindrops.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen Yu Fang for almost two years. During this time, I knew her situation very well. I am not an alarmist, but I have the sensitivity of one. As early as four or five years ago, from her fondness for vanity, weak will, and impoverished family background, I often feared that she would go down a path of depravity. However, I never had the confidence to reveal my hidden worries. How long ago was it? My fears have become reality, even worse than I imagined.</p>
<p>At first, friends said she had become a dancer, which I didn't believe. Until one day, I happened to meet her on a busy street, I was stunned: a leather coat, high heels, curved eyebrows, and scarlet lips, transforming a lively girl into a graceful and luxurious young woman. She seemed embarrassed, exchanged a few hurried greetings, shook hands with me, and said goodbye. This street was full of dance halls, so I believed the rumors, and I understood why she was avoiding us.</p>
<p>However, she didn't realize that those of us who were close to her had no intention of looking down on her. On the contrary, we were full of sympathy. Although we were powerless to help her escape the bad environment, we were willing to offer assistance and guidance when she walked down the wrong path, but she isolated us.</p>
<p>"Being a dance partner is not a disreputable profession, as long as she is truly selling her skills, and not selling her body and soul." We always wanted to offer these words to Yu Fang, although she may already know it. But in that world of pleasure, how many people are bright and pure? Perhaps they are clear-headed when they first step in, but after a long time, they are swept away by all the material and erotic temptations, and fall into the maze.</p>
<p>In a low voice, Yu Fang told me that she had been fooled by someone. She had been robbed of her innocence and lifelong happiness, and what she has now is a pregnancy in her womb. She is still young, only twenty years old. She still wants her reputation and future. Therefore, she came to ask me to ask my father to destroy this unborn little life.</p>
<p>I knew this was illegal, but I couldn't resist her pleas, and I finally walked into my father's room.</p>
<p>I mustered up my courage and asked, "Is abortion always illegal?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, it depends on the situation. If it is because of a serious illness and the fetus must be removed to save the mother, then abortion is not illegal. But within the realm of possibility, we should try our best to preserve the safety of both mother and child."</p>
<p>"What if it's for the sake of a woman's reputation and future, Father, could you perform one?" So I told him about Yu Fang's predicament.</p>
<p>"I can't," my father replied sternly. "You study law, don't you know the regulations?"</p>
<p>I told Yu Fang, and she was of course extremely disappointed. After moaning for a while, she went to ask my father herself. The result was still a refusal. My father said, "Miss, I know your difficulties, but this is not only an illegal act, but also an improper thing in a doctor's ethics. But when the time is right, I can deliver the baby for you, and vow to keep this secret. I will also arrange for the child."</p>
<p>Besides this, there was no better way. Yu Fang had no choice but to get up and leave. Finally, my father sincerely told her, "Don't find another doctor to perform an abortion for you, this is not only dangerous to your own life, but also inhumane to kill a life arbitrarily. The mistakes that have been made can be made up for with sincere repentance."</p>
<p>After Yu Fang left, my father sighed regretfully, "What a good girl, how did she end up on this path? It's really a shame!"</p>
<p>My father's last words aroused my sympathy, and I couldn't help but defend her, "Father, don't just blame her, her family should also bear half the responsibility. Her parents only knew how to suppress their children with harshness, neglecting well-intentioned guidance. When Yu Fang first became addicted to the bad habit of vanity, they didn't dissuade her, letting her spend all day and all night in the dance hall. When she officially became a dancer, they looked down on her and scolded her. She didn't get any comfort or correct guidance in her family. Even the closest family members didn't have a little warmth. Of course, upon hearing the sweet words of others, she easily believed them and easily fell into the trap. After all, she is still a naive girl, how can she distinguish between black and white, right and wrong at once? If her parents could use love to correct her mistakes, she would definitely understand that improper love between men and women is false, despicable, and unreliable, and she would definitely be content with poverty and not covet the prosperity of the world."</p>
<p>My father sighed again and again. I knew he was feeling the emotions of Yu Fang's parents from a parent's perspective.</p>

<p>— Zhu Lin</p>
<p>The ×× cigarette factory posted a notice at the gate, wanting to recruit two workers. The next morning, there were more than thirty people crowded at the factory gate.</p>
<p>The accountant was a young man full of vigor and compassion who had just come out of school. Facing these simple and honest faces, he didn't know who to hire, because these people seemed to need to find a job immediately to solve their lives.</p>
<p>He couldn't figure out a way, so he had to ask the foreman to call them in one by one and ask a few simple questions.</p>
<p>At this time, the foreman called in a very thin young man. From his gaunt face and clapping hands, the accountant saw that this was not the look of a laborer, so he asked as usual: "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Wu Zhaoguo, the 'Wu' of 'mouth' and 'heaven', the 'Zhao' of the dynasty, and the 'Guo' of the country."</p>
<p>The accountant was stunned by the first answer. These are words that someone who has studied for a few years can say.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Anhui?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid that being a worker is very hard?"</p>
<p>"For the sake of life, what's so hard about it?"</p>
<p>"The workers' pay is the lowest."</p>
<p>"But it's better than starving."</p>
<p>The accountant felt that this was not a person to be a worker. Since he couldn't help him, why bother him with irrelevant questions? So he waved his hand and said, "Come back in the afternoon to hear the news!"</p>
<p>The thin Wu Zhaoguo trudged out.</p>
<p>A weak, bookish young man is willing to come and do the hardest work with the lowest pay. This is something that the accountant feels is very strange, but it is precisely because of the deep thought caused by this strangeness that Wu Zhaoguo actually received a work card and went to work. He seemed to know the accountant's kindness, so whenever he saw the accountant at work, he would always respectfully call out, "Mr. ×!"</p>
<p>In fact, he only took two hundred and fifty yuan a day in wages, which was the lowest wage in the entire factory. Fortunately, he had no family burden and a small appetite, so life was not more difficult than other workers. It was just that he had no strength. Every time he carried a large cigarette box down the seven or eight steps of the escalator from the fourth floor, his precarious appearance was worrying, which often caused the grumbling of the packaging room manager. But when he saw that sallow face, he felt he couldn't speak, because he knew, who would willingly come to do hard labor? If he had a better way out.</p>
<p>Moreover, he only wore two thin shirts to work every day. In the morning, he would shiver from the cold. One day, the accountant asked him:</p>
<p>"Why don't you wear a few more clothes?"</p>
<p>"My winter clothes were all eaten up in the summer."</p>
<p>The accountant didn't ask any more questions. He thought that he could find a way for him to advance some wages from the factory, so he told him:</p>
<p>"Come to the accounting room after work."</p>
<p>The accountant made a note, said a few good words to the director, and borrowed two thousand yuan to be deducted from the first half of the month's wages.</p>
<p>In the evening, when Wu Zhaoguo received the money from the accountant, he was so grateful that he almost shed tears. He then told the accountant:</p>
<p>"I originally graduated from junior high school. Unfortunately, my parents both died of poverty and illness. For the past few years, I have been teaching in a small school in Nixi. But a small school teacher only gets two or three thousand yuan a month to eat, and they only get paid for ten months a year. How can people live like that? Later, I couldn't even find a small school teacher. After eating and pawning for a few months, I was really at the end of my rope."</p>
<p>The accountant was very moved by what he heard. He decided to do his best to give this unfortunate person some help.</p>
<p>When Wu Zhaoguo put on the new undershirt he bought with the advanced wages, he was warm, just like the warmth in the accountant's heart. However, when the wages were paid on the fifteenth, Wu Zhaoguo only had seven hundred and fifty yuan left after deducting the advance. This made the accountant think, how could seven hundred and fifty yuan last until the end of the month?</p>
<p>Therefore, when the accountant handed out the wage bag, he couldn't help but add: "Come and borrow some more when you run out!"</p>
<p>In the days when the price of rice was rapidly rising and breaking the ×0,000 mark, a few days later, the accountant once again begged the director to borrow fifteen hundred yuan, and the accountant generously agreed to be the guarantor.</p>
<p>But, Wu Zhaoguo took sick leave.</p>
<p>The illness was hemoptysis and laryngitis. The accountant had asked a co-worker who lived nearby to visit him. When he asked about his condition upon his return, the accountant determined that he had a serious lung disease.</p>
<p>More than ten days later, Wu Zhaoguo appeared in front of the accountant. He was so sick that his eyes were sunken and his cheekbones were high. He stared at the accountant with dull, deathly eyes.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×!"</p>
<p>The accountant noticed from his trembling that the undershirt was missing from his old jacket.</p>
<p>But Wu Zhaoguo had already noticed the accountant's attention:</p>
<p>"The undershirt was exchanged for medicine."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"A doctor's visit costs more than three hundred, and a prescription costs six or seven hundred. What can I do but wait to die?"</p>
<p>The accountant felt the salary he had just received in his pocket, but he thought of his old mother and weak younger brother, and he also thought of the tens of thousands of yuan per dan of rice, and he also thought of the loan guaranteed for Wu Zhaoguo. He felt very hesitant.</p>
<p>However, the spirit-like patient standing in front of him was tapping on his kind heart, and he took out six hundred yuan from his meager reward for a whole month of hard work as if with a great determination and gave it to him.</p>
<p>"This is my personal help to you."</p>
<p>Wu Zhaoguo slowly reached out to take the money, speaking with a faint voice, "You also guaranteed the loan for me, Mr. ×, I cannot repay your kindness in this life, I will repay you in the next life!"</p>
<p>The accountant's heart felt very heavy. He only said, "Go back and rest well," and sent him out of the factory gate.</p>
<p>Another week later.</p>
<p>A co-worker came to tell the accountant:</p>
<p>"Wu Zhaoguo vomited blood and died. He died in the workshop of the ×× yarn factory where he was living. He was a single person without any relatives. It's so pitiful. Early this morning, Pushan Villa..."</p>
<p>The accountant couldn't bear to listen any longer.</p>
<p>He felt that maybe he had harmed him. If he hadn't hired him to be a worker at that time, and hadn't done such hard work, maybe he wouldn't have died so quickly! He felt the pain, because when he was still in school, he had never thought that there would be such tragic things in the world, and even today he still doubts:</p>
<p>Is society really so cruel?</p>

<h3 id="e40">Sino-Portuguese Cup: Learning from Past Mistakes, Further Contributing to the Chinese Team's Lineup <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yiqin</p>
<p>After being suspended for several years, the Sino-Portuguese Cup has been reinstated by the Football Association this year, much to the delight of fans. This year's Chinese team is brimming with talent, and the Portuguese team is also very well-organized. There is no doubt that the skill displayed will be worth watching. Furthermore, considering the current state of the Chinese team, it is not hopeless to defeat the three cities. The lineup contributed by Mr. Bi Xian in the previous issue was very insightful, but unfortunately, the authorities did not adopt it. In the second half, arbitrary substitutions were made, with Zhang Lingen filling the rear, Li Yichen playing center-back, and Sun Jinshun as center-forward. All of these were forcing them into unfamiliar positions, a reckless gamble. How can any achievement be expected in a competition concerning international honor? As a result, they suffered a crushing defeat, disappointing thousands of fans. The loss was secondary; the lack of a good performance was truly regrettable. What's done is done. The cup uses a best-of-three format. Having lost the first game, the Chinese team should learn from this lesson and redouble their efforts. They can still win the remaining two games and secure this year's reinstated Sino-Portuguese Cup. Before the date of the second game is decided, I would like to express my personal views, hoping it will serve as a combination of damage control and preventative measure.</p>
<p>Advantages of the Portuguese Team in the First Game</p>
<p>First, let's look back at the advantages of the Portuguese team in the first game. The entire team can be said to have achieved a state of perfect harmony. A special point is the ability of the center-back line to coordinate with both the front and the rear. Secondly, the selection and deployment of the forwards were appropriate, with V. Sousa shifting to the left wing, achieving the effect of both wings flying together. Center-forward Bauxita was good at running and making penetrating runs, while the two inside forwards, Leda and Pantouxon, were both able to retreat and assist in defense, forming a seven-man defense. During the attack, they acted as cover, completing a formal "W" formation on their line, and each was able to use their strengths. Since the Chinese team's defense was weak, the Portuguese team was able to fully display its strengths.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Chinese Team's Failure</p>
<p>Having identified the advantages of the Portuguese team in all aspects, we can seek ways to counter them. Here, we might as well discuss the criticisms of the Chinese team on that day. In my opinion, Meng Yiliang and Wu Qixiang performed satisfactorily, while Zhang Lingen, Zheng Yingyao, and Luo Shoufu were out of form, and the rest were mediocre. Now, let's further discuss the lineup for the next battle, hoping that the authorities will adopt it accordingly and not dismiss it as mere armchair strategy. This is extremely important!</p>
<p>The most important aspect of a team's connectivity is the center-back line. Seeing the Chinese team's previous defeat and the Portuguese team's victory, I am even more convinced of this. Therefore, I dare to start with a study of the center-back line. For the center-back position, I believe Song Lingsheng must be used. Song is a skilled ball-handler, and the attack relies on this central route. Furthermore, Zhou and Song have similarities in terms of height and speed of center-forward Bauxita, so letting Song focus on Bauxita can ensure there are no worries. This will stop the Portuguese team's central breakthrough tactic. The left midfielder should still be Meng Yiliang. Yiliang has been in excellent form recently. He was quite effective in harassing Funes in the previous game. Therefore, it is generally said that Funes did not develop much in that game and should be considered out of form. This is a misunderstanding; it should be attributed to Yiliang's hard work. Using Yiliang's abundant energy to contain Funes is equivalent to crippling one of their wings. Then, use Tan Fuzhen as the right midfielder. Some people will definitely object to this, and Tan himself may be reluctant to try it lightly, but upon close observation, the opponent's left forward and left winger, retreat to assist the defense, taking advantage of the winger's rapid advance. The winger is V. Sousa, who is deeply accomplished. Sousa's skills are composed but directional, just like Zhou and Old Tan. An eye for an eye, though resulting in mutual damage, will also cripple their wings. With both wings lost, the reduction in their offensive momentum will be a definite fact. Even if it cannot be as ideal as I said, occasional losses are inevitable. We can retreat and discuss further. Use Wu Qixiang as the right fullback. Wu has recently returned to his peak form, excelling in all aspects, making him the most ideal candidate. Therefore, even if V. Sousa slips past Tan Fuzhen, he will definitely not be able to pass Wu Qixiang. The left fullback is still Li Tiansheng, who is more cooperative with Zhou and Wu Qixiang. The goalkeeper should also be Liu Nanhan, which will allow for a better understanding with Qixiang and Tiansheng. In this way, each individual on the defensive line has a tight combat responsibility, working together to stop the sharp Portuguese forward line. The wonderful moments, the evenly matched strengths, will definitely be worth watching.</p>
<p>Ideal Lineup</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the forward line. My view is the same as Mr. Bi Xian. Looking at the first game and reviewing the current situation, Xu Wenkui and Dai Linjing are injured and are unlikely to appear in the near future. Jia Youliang as right winger, Han Longhai as right forward, Li Yichen as center forward, Sun Jinshun as left forward, and Li Yao as left winger, all have their own strengths. The opponent's defense is good, but it is hoped that they can be broken through. In short, although this lineup is only one person's opinion, it is reasonable and represents the general consensus. I consider myself a loyal fan. For more than ten years, I have attended every good game, and I have interacted with other fans, discussing with great interest. However, I have rarely written before. This time, seeing that the Chinese team, with so much talent, is unable to make good use of it, I am filled with emotion. Therefore, I am happy to discuss it further to enrich this newspaper. The writing is clumsy, but I hope knowledgeable people will not laugh at it. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese team's lineup in the second game of the Sino-Portuguese Cup will be as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Li Tiansheng Xian Han Wu Qixiang Meng Yiliang Song Lingsheng Tan Fuzhen Li Yao Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Han Longhai Jia Youliang</p>

<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>(1) When the situation is not suitable for shooting, it is better to hold the ball tightly and turn to avoid the opponent, or pass it back to a teammate behind you, rather than rushing to shoot in order to get rid of the ball.</p>
<p>(2) Do not shoot with your back to the basket, because you cannot see the basket accurately, which is equivalent to giving the ball away to the opponent.</p>
<p>(3) Do not shoot when you are off balance.</p>
<p>(4) Use both hands to shoot as much as possible.</p>
<p>(5) Shoot when you are in an area where you are very confident, or when you cannot pass or dribble the ball. Remember the steps of individual offense: (1) Pass the ball - (2) Dribble the ball - (3) Shoot the ball - (4) "Rotate"</p>
<p>(6) For shots within 20 feet and at an angle of 15 to 45 degrees from the free throw line, use a bank shot. At other angles, use a direct shot into the hoop.</p>
<p>(7) When shooting under the basket, use one hand, jump high, and the closer you are to the basket, the more accurate you will be.</p>
<p>(8) Use moderate force when shooting, and do not try to overdo it.</p>
<p>(9) Do not shoot in a straight line, but make the path of the ball an arc into the basket.</p>
<p>(10) Do not stand still after shooting, but immediately follow up and try to regain the ball to attack, or if the ball is lost, retreat to defend.</p>
<p>(Correction) In this article published on December 31, there are several parts that should be corrected as follows. (1) In the tenth line of the first paragraph, the word "gain" in "its gain and failure" is a mistake for "win." (2) In the fifteenth line, the word "equal" in "this may be equal rumors" is a mistake for "belong". (3) In the second last line of the third paragraph, the word "outside" in "however, they often fail to shoot outside" is a mistake for "commit". (4) In the fifth line of the first paragraph, the word "is" in "but what method is used" is a mistake for "no."</p>

<p>The 30 million people of the Philippines have already realized their long-cherished wish for autonomous independence. They are going a step further, sparing no effort to shed blood and sweat, in order to fulfill the mission of a rear base. The hope of the Philippine Islands to participate in the war is burning brightly in the production enhancement war. Sugar, which was originally produced for export to the United States, has now been converted to cotton, a necessity of life. After political independence, they have embarked on a giant step towards economic independence. The Philippine people under the war are now closely assisting Japan in order to defeat the old enemies, Britain and the United States. The youth of the Philippines, whether in the seaman training center or in the shipyard and mines, are passionate and dedicated to laying the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Under the cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, the brave Japanese army is inviting the US military to attack on the islands of Leyte and Mindoro. Seeing the heroic posture of the Filipinos who are working hard in close cooperation with Japan, we cannot help but feel the glory of the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>(1) Philippine youth sailors receive rigorous training on board, full of spirit.</p>
<p>(2) The elite troops of the Philippine Islands under the command of President Laurel are rising up in unison.</p>
<p>(3) The Philippine Chinese Association held its inaugural meeting, which was enthusiastically attended by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(4) The Philippine wooden shipyard is actively building ships, a corner of the factory is pictured.</p>
<p>(5) The people of the Philippine Islands are fully mining the mines to contribute to the war effort.</p>
<p>(6) The Philippine Islands have a bumper harvest of cotton, and local women are engaged in collection work, smiling.</p>
