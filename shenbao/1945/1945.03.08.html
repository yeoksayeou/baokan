<h3>呂宋島榮達爾班附近　展開陣地爭奪戰　日航空部隊轟炸雷伊泰敵陣地</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫七日中央社電　蒙達爾班附近之敵，在日軍正面構築陣地中，日方屢次果敢攻擊，奪取敵一部陣地，敵軍亦向日軍進襲，展開陣地爭奪戰。四日敵携迫擊砲三門，向日軍陣地攻擊，日方將其擊退，敵軍刻正遂漸擴張範圍之重砲陣地，馬尼剌北部卡羅坎，馬尼刺北部機塲及諾巴里基斯西北，馬尼刺東方庫巴俄屋幹等地，有十五生的至二十生的之溜彈砲頗多，向日軍陣地不斷轟擊。又日軍右翼陣安得保　附近敵之砲擎及轟炸，亦漸次激化，正式大攻防戰，不久即將展開，其他戰綫無大變化。南部拉古那河南岸卡朗拉地方，雙方依然激戰中。北方戰綫，三日下午有的兩連之敵，向聖法比安東方的三十公里之聖馬轟爾日軍陣地進攻被擊退，此外並無新動態。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>黑帽子毆斃旅客案件</h3>
<p>三月四日，北站黑帽子蔣士彥，兇毆旅客許徐佩文，重傷慘死一案，已由死者家慶委請律師進行控訴，兇手罪刑自有法律處分。我們爲認識黑帽子暴行眞相，特派記者實地觀察。（目覩現狀記如本日本版）周時，我們讀了死者家屬呈報鎭江同鄉會訴述毆打致死經過，對於黑帽子之目無法紀，殊堪髮指。我們認爲不但兇手應處以應得之罪，即黑帽子的管理者，平素督率無方，自也不能亂共咎。</p>
<p>車站黑帽子的跋扈猖狂，早已爲社會交責，這決不是社會對於黑帽子吹毛求疵而苛責，實在是黑帽子自身的殘暴行爲造成衆矢之的。可是，過去社會的交責，並未使黑帽子歛跡而知所炯戒，這次旅客許婦的慘遭毆傷致死案件，更加證明了黑帽子變本加厲的暴行。然而黑帽子的身份究竟是一種車站僕役，爲什麽竟敢如此爲非作歹，爲什麽竟敢如此目無法紀，我們認爲這是由於管理黑帽子者姑容放縱所致。更嚴格的說，管理者與黑帽子之間的朋比爲奸，因是黑帽子就夜郞自大，有恃無恐。所以，黑帽子的不法行爲，管理者絕對不能諉卸責任。此共一。</p>
<p>黑帽子是華中鐵道公司職工之一種，黑帽子的不法行爲，旣爲社會所交責，爲什麽鐵道當局對於職工不法行爲充耳不聞，不加整頓？如果華鐵當局能够重視輿論，對於黑帽子早加整頓，那末，這次許婦案件，決不致發生。華鐵當局爲車站僕役的不法行爲，而甘於損毁整個路譽，誠是百思不解，此其二。</p>
<p>這次許婦案件，我們認爲並不是僅爲蔣士彥與許婦之間的刑事問題，更不是鎭江同鄉會爲同鄉受害主張公道問題，而是整個黑帽子與放客間的糾粉問題，也是整個鐵道交通的良　問題，更是整個社會嚴重問題。如果蔣士彥不能歸案處罰，如果黑帽子不能從速整頓，則鐵道交通將視爲畏途，鐵路無異荊棘，試問鐵道的使命何在？便利行旅的意義何在？身負鐵道管理責任者更不能輕易放任。此其三。</p>
<p>目前在決戰時期，鐵道負交通運輸的重任，鐵道管理者如果對於所屬僕役如黑帽子者，尙無法整飭，那末，對於戰時運輸的重任能否勝任，能否盡職，我們實不能不表示疑問。</p>
<p>况且，現在市政府正積極進行疏散人口，疏散過程中最重要者就是交通運輸，鐵道交通當然是疏散工作中最重要的一項，當局希望市民自動疏散，允許疏散者旅行上的便利，今許婦正在遵從當局命令自動疏散，反遭車站僕役重毆致死，對於疏散工作實有莫大的惡劣影響。我們早會主張如果鐵道當局無法整頓黑帽子，那末市政當局以至中樞當局爲實施改善交通運輸，就須干涉，决不能放任腐化。希望市政當局曁建設部主管常局，對於車站黑帽子督促整頓，並盼鐵道當局從速自振，重視淸議，除將許案兇犯協緝交案外，對於黑帽子切實整頓，淘汰惡化份子，重加訓練，挽救路譽。</p>
<h3>日精銳航空隊　活躍緬戰綫　深夜奇襲敵後方基地</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地六日中央社電　四日午前某時，緬甸方面日軍精銳航空部隊，曾轟炸伊洛瓦底江戰綫綏鮑及他麻道（派科克西方五十公里）之敵後方基地卡米育，日溪東部印度之克庫斯巴禮等各地敵航空基地，時値深夜，日機乘隙衝入日溪布卡克休之上空，超低空盤旋，於數飛機塲上空對敵基地各種設施正確投彈，擊毁其飛機若干架，起大火焚燒。又另一日機部隊亦奇製成功，投彈命中滑走路，飛機庫及其他地上設施，並擎落敵夜間戰鬥機二架。此外，向其他敵基地進攻之日機隊，亦各施行奇襲攻擊，擊退敵夜間戰鬥機之抵抗，投彈擎毁敵機及其地上設施。</p>
<h3>衛立煌部下達軍損失</h3>
<p>北緬前綫六日中央社電　渝方所倚重之衛立煌麾下襲南遠征軍十六師，自去年五月對怒江正面開始總反攻以來，與美軍駢肩作戰，迄突破渝緬國境畹町爲止，已歷十閱月，其間曾與日軍精銳展開激戰，此優勢之渝軍，自遭驍勇善戰之日軍流血戰法，致全軍消耗殆盡，刻渝軍正將其兵力集結於畹町以北，積極整頓，企圖恢復兵力，據渝軍一俘虜稱，在該時期內，雲南遠征軍損害，實已達十五萬人。</p>
<h3>襲帛琉島敵機　墜毀廿七架</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地七日中央社電　四日上午六時半至下午一時之間，敵艦戰機曾以戰鬥及轟炸機聯合累計的一百〇八架，三度來襲帛疏羣島之克羅爾，阿拉加，貝聖島，馬拉加爾島，及帛琉本島，結果，爲該方面日軍部隊擊落P40十三架，擊毁十四架。</p>

<p>蕪湖七日中央社電　蕪縣府以國父逝世紀念瞬届，爲推進造林運動，亟應積極籌備，爰召開籌備會，議決要案多件。</p>
<h3>進一步維持軍紀　協力平抑物價　蕭陸長對記者發表談話</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　記者頃叩訪新任陸長蕭叔宣氏對首都維紀委員會之意見如何，承發表談話如下：首都物資平價維紀委員會，爲適應環境之需要而成立，關於維持軍紀一項，本爲國家軍人應盡之職責，今後本人決將澈底整飭「軍風紀」，嚴厲執行軍法，倘仍有不法軍人遠紀者，決處以極刑。至於抑平物價之方策，其要旨即在於「平」，換言之，當局有「合理的限價」，商人只應得「合法的利潤」，如此可符合過去該會評定「限價」之原則。今後將更進一步維持軍紀，協力平抑物價，以期首都人民之生活得以安定，當爲民衆對該會之厚望</p>
<h3>葉蓬募集賑款</h3>

<h3>黑帽子雄風一瞥</h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>前天報上載着「黑帽子蔣士彥毆打旅客婦女許佩文重傷致死」的消息以後，很爲納罕，難道黑帽子竟敢這樣的胡作胡爲嗎？因此，引起了前去一探眞相的動機，昨天早晨匆匆跑到北站，走到了售票處屋簷下，距離售票處不過一丈多遠，人們正在呼喊着咒駡着，也在相互傾軋着，擁來擠去，黑帽子就走在木栅上上居高臨下，如臨大敵似的在揮舞着他那無情的皮帶，直往旅客的頭上，臉上，肩上，背上亂抽，旅客在慘叫着，掙扎着，有的氈帽，禮帽就從這裘被擲出了二三丈遠的人堆中去，人們的臉被打得發靑發紫。記者看見一個六十多歲的老者，已在這皮鞭帶的勢力圈內，東躱也是人，西藏也是人，旣不能够前進，也走不出行列，可憐他辛辛苦苦挨到了售票口，但在皮帶的淫威之下也不得不拋了自己來的目的，而想逃出去了，但旣到這里，不管買到買不到，他臉上的血終於被打出來了。</p>
<p>我站在高處，從容的和淸楚的看一　這人海裏究竟在玩着一些什末把戲，我這時才轉眼到售票口，原來還有一個黑帽子兩脚分踏在兩旁木　上蹲在那裏，二隻手正在用皮帶抽着他下面的人，人們被打又退了一兩步之後，這黑帽子就自已低下頭，伸手到售票口，三張五張的大買特買，另外一個黑帽子正在官官相護的協力阻止旅客逼近窗口，他不僅用皮帶使勁亂抽，並且用脚亂踹亂踢，人們在憤怒地咒駡着，躲避着，推擠着，就在這刹那黑帽子一遍一遍買，買了一刻多鐘，各種不同站頭的票想必已經全買到。據記者估計，至少這人買了有三十張以上，這是多末驚人約數目，但記者移轉目光看到售票窗旁寫着「每人限購一張」的招貼，不禁罵之愕然。當這位黑帽子買够了得意的跳下來的時候，跟著窗口馬上就關閉了起來，裏面的黑窗帘布也無情的落了下來「賣完了」，「賣完了」的聲音還隱約從窗裏傳了出米。這時其餘黑帽子和車站警察也就洋洋得意的走了，留下來的還是那些戀戀不捨離去的正當的買票者。據窗口前幾個人說，我們已接連跑來買了四天了，今天好容易才排到最前而，千辛萬苦的從頭一天的晚上八點鐘就來等了整整的一夜天，在零度以下的寒風裏身體都被凍僵了，凍麻木了，然而從開窗售票起，眼睜睜的看着這一個黑帽子買過了，那一個代替了來買。他們却永遠買不着票子；而打呢却是無法避免，黑帽子打了別人而養肥了自己，在這個兒我發覺了人對於原來是如此淺酷的。我在歸途中又默想這一件黑帽子毆斃旅客案，並不是煊染過甚的，而社會對於黑帽子的交責，也並非過苛了，未知當局對此作何感想？</p>
<h3>強渡萊因河　將展開大戰　英美軍包團計劃失敗</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍繼續在萊因河作奮勇之後衛戰，不使敵軍渡河，敵至今未能抵達河岸之全部，使其攻勢之進展大受妨碍。現德軍主力雖退至河東，惟河西仍有德軍師團或軍團在繼續作戰。敵方報吿承認包圍工業區之計劃未能成功，小隊德軍被困雖似難免，然大隊之德軍至今未曾有陷於包圍者。預料今後之戰，將爲艾森霍華攻勢之第二階段，以强渡萊因河爲主。</p>
<p>科隆巷戰劇烈進行　柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：廣闊之萊因河下游已爲英美軍自登陸以來最可畏之天然障碍。科隆之破瓦頹垣中，現正劇戰中，敵軍已突入西火車站及城之內圈，德軍予敵坦克車以堅强之抵抗。杜塞爾道夫之德軍橋頭堡，被敵軍大砲飛機猛轟，但局勢無大變。埃斯寇琛城Euskirchen附近德軍西迫退至通萊恩堡之公路，萊因下游雖尙在酣戰中，但反軸心軍已無從達到殲滅西岸德軍之目的。萊因下游以南之戰爭僅屬局部性質。</p>
<h3>波默拉尼亞　流動戰激烈　蘇軍向坎明推進</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍在波默拉尼亞及西普魯士方面之活動，顯示將大舉進攻矣，沃特河與維斯杜拉河間運動戰甚激烈，蘇軍自阿恩斯華爾特·卡萊斯方面進攻業已停頓，蘇軍由紐斯丹丁等處進攻，發生劇戰。蘇軍坦克隊已佔領柯斯林，向坎明推進。波默拉尼亞中部有劇烈運動戰</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍在哥里茲與勞本間及奧貝思與奧斯特勞間整理部隊，殆將發動新攻勢。最近二十四小時內蘇機猛炸布萊斯勞，但步兵僅作小規模之進攻。</p>
<h3>芬總統孟納興　稱病不親政　含有政治意味</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　德國社訊：赫爾辛基消息：芬蘭總統孟納鄉元帥患病，其職務已由總理巴斯基維依照憲法代理。總統於星期一經由司法部長通知芬政府，謂自星期一起至另行通知時止，渠將未能執行職務。總統患病消息，已使芬京發生重大騷動。</p>
<p>又訊　瑞京消息靈通之芬蘭方面相信，孟納鄉元帥患病消息，係有政治性，孟氏或將辭總統職，孟氏於芬蘇作戰時，曾統率芬軍，渠乃一極右派之政治家，殊非莫斯科方面所歡迎者。</p>
<h3>三國會議後之　歐洲戰局</h3>
<p>英美蘇三國公布已於克里米亞會談決定對德共同作戰，惟通觀該會談後之歐洲戰局，最大焦點依然在於東部戰綫。柏林正面戰綫之蘇柯夫軍，右翼向你德琴方面挺進，戰况相當活潑，其他方面則比較遲滯。同時，柯尼夫軍之向薩克森進攻及自沃特河西岸北上，國與蘇柯夫軍會師之進擊，非常活潑。由此等行動觀之，蘇軍似巳無意正面攻擊柏林。據柏林方面消息，德軍當局亦傾向此種觀測。蘇軍若果避免正面攻擊柏林，則其理由當因大都市頗多化爲堅固要塞之可能，德軍將使柏林化爲斯達林格勒第二，是以毋寗深向該市南北挺進，陷柏林於孤立，茍有可能且加以包國。此外似尙企圖令柯尼夫軍進窺薩克森，先行控制德國南部。惟柯尼夫軍之行動，早爲德軍識破，故已加强該方面戰綫。十七日蘇聯前綫消息亦謂：「因沃特河前綫德軍之抵抗業已强化，紅軍一部已自該河西岸退至東岸。」該方面深堪注目之事件，乃英美空軍十五日對特萊斯登，可托勃斯等地區旅行大規模轟炸，此係英美空軍呼應蘇軍地面進擊之最初共同作戰。蘇聯當局於十七日發表稱：「爲期英美空軍密切協力紅軍今後攻勢起見，艾森霍華軍首腦部之空軍將領，業已奉命參加紅軍參謀部，近已抵達莫斯科。」此項聲明與前述事項有關，殊足暗示今後英美空軍對德轟炸之方向。</p>
<p>其次，西綫雖未開始大規模攻勢，然正如英美聯軍之最初計劃，現方着着準備突破齊格變防綫北部。一部分人士稱，或將實行斯坎的那維亞半島上陸作戰，惟因今日船舶已感不敷，諒不致再行發動需要多數船舶之新作戰。茍有之，則必爲希爾哥蘭灣岸之上陸作戰，蓋頗有自此接近德中心臓部之可能。（蘇黎支十八日特電）（譯自二月十十日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>黑帽子毆斃少婦案　鎭江同鄕會主持公道　委主律師進行法律手續</h3>
<p>鎭江少婦許徐佩文，於本月四日上午在北站被葉中鐵道公司黑帽子蔣士彥因毆慘一案，經過情形，棠誌昨報。鎭江旅滬同鄕會據其家屬報吿後，極爲憤慨，僉認爲車六墨帽子橫行不法，公然行兇，致人於死，若不依法嚴懲，則何足以安行旅面維法紀，除分呈市政府，地方檢察署及市諮詢委員委員呼籲請求輯兇辦法外，並委請陳榮發律師代表同鄕會協助死者家屬，進行法律手續。茲探錄死者家屬呈同鄕會文如左：</p>
<p>家屬呈文</p>
<p>「慘啓者，心茂等原籍鎭江，現旅居本市閘北新疆路新德興里二十一號，近因滬地疏散人口，擬將婆母及三歲幼女送回鎭江原籍，當於三月四日上午二時，着弟媳徐佩文，午二十五歲，赴北站四號售票處購票守候天明七時，不料爲車六黑帽蔣士顏無端亂毆，弟媳稍加理論，伊更凶怒，即將弟媳頭髪揪住，橫拖至伊之辦公室內，閉門狂繫，拳足交加，致遍體重傷。當由凶手領班李逸仙及周順初等擅自僱車保送弟媳至靶子路上海療養院，其時心順雖已聞奔到，未悉詳情，復遭對方多人軟禁，制止報捕，致使凶犯乘機潛逃，殊堪痛恨。後弟媳經醫師診斷，認爲受傷太重，十分危險，當施剖腹手術後，將腰子取出，已被繫爲兩爿，延至三月五日上午一時四十五分，慘呼逝世。其時北站分局已得報吿，因凶犯逃避，未能緝獲，即向華中鐵道當局請求交出凶手保人，未獲要領，該局隨即派員將慫恿凶犯之李逸仙周順初等拘押，幷日夜偵查，迄無效果。心茂等以疏散未成，反遭家破人亡之慘禍，若容凶犯逍遙法外，何以慰寃魂於泉下，爲特據情串請，尙祈貴同鄕會本維護同鄕立塲，主持正義，呼籲各界疾起聲援，務使凶犯就法，以慰寃魂，而振紀綱，不勝迫切待命之至。許心茂。順謹呈。」</p>
<h3>渝方依賴英美　將演成悲劇　出淵部長揭露敵美野心</h3>
<p>盟邦日本陸軍報道部，於昨（七）日下午三時，假漢彌登大夏舉行報道常會，到有出淵部長即席闡述美國對渝之野心，其企圖將使重慶遭受悲慘命連等，至爲綦詳。茲誌談話如次：</p>
<p>敵美計劃增加戰費</p>
<p>部長首謂：邇近敵美計劃增加對日戰費，創設太平洋航空隊與增强太平洋防空補給基地，復舉行太平洋各戰綫會議，並設立太平洋前綫司令部等，表示對日作戰之積極化。敵美復提高對渝之慫恿，蓋日軍在中國大陸作戰，自佔領桂林後，已成貫連大陸態勢，使東亞戰局日形惡化，然造成上述局而，均係渝軍政之紛亂，與國共不合作所致，故重慶在東亞之責任，實有再加檢討之必要。現美一面聯絡延安，一面採取與渝歙和對付日本，予渝方以經濟援助，藉以增加軍需品爲目標。</p>
<p>對渝合作干涉內政</p>
<p>但美與渝方合作，干涉其內政，無非玩弄重慶而已。重慶政權始終迷惑於依賴英美之夢想，相信敵力在菲島戰勝之宣傳，認爲日軍戰敗即在目前，錯誤抗戰，致使民生塗炭，及今八載。目下渝方又擬將中國大陸作爲菲島戰勝後之對日作戰塲合，此乃渝方依賴英美之最高峯，然重慶怒叱科執迷於英美政策，實渝政權之悲哀。渝方並希望反軸心國於戰勝後，依賴英美收拾國內之殘局。試觀英美帝國佔領或管理後各小國之情形　例如巴特里奧政權，初擬投降英美獲得解放，不料反轉入三國糾紛之　　。又如反軸心佔領下之義國南方，到處充滿飢餓，失業，犯罪，賣淫之現象，波蘭則演成三國勢力爭奪之活劇，除非波鬧作戰敗國外，別無他法。又中希臘之內亂，保加利亞之暴動，法國之窘困等等，不難獲得不以自己力量，依賴反軸心之末路矣。</p>
<p>英美內部困難重重</p>
<p>英美內部問題，亦復衆多，如軍需生產之不振，人力補充困難等，均非常嚴重，尤以美國人力資源缺乏，吏軍需生產前途潛伏莫大危機，美鑒於歐洲西部戰局緊張，東亞日軍出血力戰，人之資源消耗愈多，補給綫延長困難，故應用四F級（衰弱者）民衆作戰。</p>
<p>英美向以慈善事業或金錢物價質生產等煽動他國，以求達到已身利益，現渝方對英美估計過高，其結果將造成至慘悲劇，與歐洲各小國同其命運。按歷史之敎訓，民族存亡，依同一民族之團結，努力更生，實決定其前途與命運也。</p>

<h3>Three Points of Questions Submitted to the House of Representatives; Regular Resumption of the Japanese Diet; Government to Clarify Beliefs on Grave Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 7th, at 10:00 AM, the Japanese House of Representatives held a conference in the Diet building to discuss the resumption of the Diet. As a result, it was decided to request the government to select one of the days between the 10th, 11th, and 12th to resume the Diet. At the same time, three points of questions were raised to the government: (1) The government's attitude towards the current situation. (2) The progress of the decisive battle measures. (3) Countermeasures for damages. Furthermore, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have decided to listen to the government's opinions separately in the morning and afternoon of the day of resumption.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The House of Peers and the House of Representatives of the 86th Japanese Diet entered a state of natural recess on the 8th and 13th of last month, respectively. Recently, the Japanese government, considering the gravity of the situation, will resume the Diet around the 11th to clarify the government's beliefs and decided to expect 100 million citizens to bravely fight. This was reported by Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishiwata at the regular administrative vice-ministers' meeting on the 7th, and each administrative vice-minister was asked to actively cooperate.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Positions Near Montalban, Luzon; Japanese Air Force Bombs Enemy Positions in Leyte</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 7th (Central News Agency) - The enemy near Montalban is constructing positions in front of the Japanese army. The Japanese side has repeatedly attacked bravely, seizing some of the enemy's positions. The enemy forces also attacked the Japanese army, engaging in a battle for positions. On the 4th, the enemy attacked the Japanese positions with three mortars, but the Japanese side repelled them. The enemy forces are currently gradually expanding their heavy artillery positions. In Caloocan north of Manila, the northern airfield of Manila, and northwest of Novaliches, and Kuba E-Wu-Gan east of Manila, there are many stray shells of 15cm to 20cm constantly bombarding the Japanese positions. Furthermore, the enemy's artillery fire and bombing near the Japanese army's right flank position, Ande Bao, is gradually intensifying. A formal large-scale defense battle is about to begin. There are no major changes on other fronts. On the south bank of Laguna de Bay in the Kalangla area, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. On the northern front, on the afternoon of the 3rd, two companies of the enemy attacked the Japanese position in St. Michael, 30 kilometers east of San Fabian, but were repelled. Otherwise, there are no new developments.</p>
<p>Luzon, 7th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces at Clark Field have launched offensives for several consecutive days. On the 4th, with more than ten tanks and 600 infantry, they attacked the Japanese army's right flank position, but were bravely repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is now shortening the battle lines, and soldiers are engaging in bayonet charges. The enemy's artillery fire on the Japanese army's central strongholds is extremely fierce, with shrapnel and smoke covering the military positions. The Japanese army and navy are closely cooperating to maintain the main positions. A part of the enemy forces broke into the right flank position on the 4th, but were severely defeated and retreated by the Japanese army. On the 5th, the enemy forces used flamethrowers and white phosphorus incendiary bombs on the Japanese army's right flank and central strongholds, attempting to break through the positions but failed. The Clark Field airfield currently has two B24 enemy planes, twelve medium-sized planes, thirty small planes, and two transport planes. The Japanese Air Force, in response to the enemy's ground operations, launched an air raid on the airfield at dawn on the 5th, destroying five supply depots. Furthermore, the brave fighting of the Japanese army's commando units inflicted many casualties on the enemy.</p>

<h3>Japanese Garrison on Iwo Jima Launches Counterattack with Main Force</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. forces on Iwo Jima launched another attack from the 4th to the 5th, under the support of intense combat fire, bombing, and mortar fire. Especially in front of the Japanese positions in the driftwood area of the northern part of the island, a fierce battle continued throughout the day. Furthermore, since dawn on the 6th, under the cover of intense naval gun fire, mortar fire, and small arms fire, the enemy ground forces launched a full-scale attack. However, the Japanese army still defended various strongholds such as Mount Osaka, Mount Tamana, and the driftwood area in the northern part of the island, engaging in fierce battles. Furthermore, they inflicted significant damage on the enemy who invaded the positions near Mount Higashi. After the Japanese garrison launched a counterattack with its main force on the night of the 5th, it threw the enemy into chaos and joined forces with the friendly troops in the northern driftwood area. Fierce battles unfolded in various areas throughout the 4th. The results achieved by the Japanese army, as far as can be ascertained, are as follows: In the driftwood area of the northern part of the island, the assault troops killed and wounded 1,300 enemy soldiers and destroyed two tanks.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Case of the Black Hat Killing a Traveler</h3>
<p>On March 4th, a black hat at the North Station, Jiang Shiyan, brutally beat a traveler, Xu Xuiwen, causing serious injuries and a tragic death. The deceased's family has entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit, and the perpetrator's crime will be punished by law. In order to understand the truth about the black hat's violence, we sent a reporter to observe the situation on the ground. (The current situation is recorded in this Japanese edition.) At the same time, we read the report from the deceased's family to the Zhenjiang Fellow Association, recounting the circumstances of the beating to death, and we are outraged by the black hat's disregard for the law. We believe that not only should the perpetrator be punished for his crime, but the manager of the black hats, who usually fails to supervise properly, cannot shirk responsibility. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The arrogance and recklessness of the black hats at the station has long been criticized by society. This is by no means society being overly critical of the black hats, but rather the result of the black hats' own brutal behavior making them the target of public condemnation. However, past social criticism has not caused the black hats to restrain themselves and learn from their mistakes. This time, the tragic case of the traveler Xu being beaten to death further proves the black hats' increasingly intensified violence. However, the black hats' identity is ultimately a kind of station servant. Why do they dare to act so recklessly, why do they dare to disregard the law so much? We believe that this is due to the connivance and indulgence of those who manage the black hats. More strictly speaking, the collusion between the managers and the black hats is the reason why the black hats are so arrogant and feel they have nothing to fear. Therefore, the managers cannot shirk responsibility for the black hats' illegal behavior. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Black hats are a type of employee of the Central China Railway Company. Since the black hats' illegal behavior has been criticized by society, why has the railway authority turned a deaf ear to the employees' illegal behavior and failed to rectify it? If the China Railway Authority could value public opinion and rectify the black hats earlier, then this Xu case would never have happened. The China Railway Authority is willing to damage its entire reputation for the illegal behavior of the station servants, which is truly perplexing. This is the second point.</p>
<p>This time, the Xu case, we believe, is not only a criminal issue between Jiang Shiyan and Xu, nor is it only a matter of the Zhenjiang Fellow Association advocating justice for the victimized fellow villager, but rather a problem of the dispute between the entire black hat and the traveler, as well as a problem of the integrity of the entire railway transportation, and even a serious social problem. If Jiang Shiyan cannot be brought to justice and punished, if the black hats cannot be rectified as soon as possible, then railway transportation will be regarded as a daunting journey, and the railway will be no different from a thorny path. May I ask, what is the mission of the railway? What is the meaning of facilitating travel? Those who bear the responsibility of managing the railway cannot easily let it go. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Currently, we are in a decisive battle period, and the railway bears the heavy responsibility of transportation. If the railway managers cannot rectify the servants under their command, such as the black hats, then can they be competent for the heavy responsibility of wartime transportation, can they fulfill their duties? We really cannot help but express our doubts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current municipal government is actively carrying out the evacuation of the population. The most important thing in the evacuation process is transportation. Railway transportation is of course the most important item in the evacuation work. The authorities hope that the citizens will automatically evacuate and allow those who evacuate to have convenience in travel. Now, Xu is following the orders of the authorities to automatically evacuate, but is brutally beaten to death by the station servants, which has a great negative impact on the evacuation work. We have long advocated that if the railway authorities cannot rectify the black hats, then the municipal authorities and even the central authorities must intervene in order to implement improved transportation, and cannot allow corruption to continue. We hope that the municipal authorities and the department in charge of construction will urge the railway authorities to rectify the station black hats, and we also hope that the railway authorities will quickly rejuvenate themselves, value public opinion, and, in addition to arresting the perpetrators of the Xu case and handing them over for prosecution, will thoroughly rectify the black hats, eliminate the bad elements, re-train them, and save the reputation of the railway.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Black Hats' Power</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>After reading the news in the newspaper the day before yesterday that "Black Hat Jiang Shiyan Beat Traveler Xu Xuiwen to Death," I was very surprised. How could black hats dare to act so recklessly? Therefore, it aroused my motivation to go and explore the truth. Yesterday morning, I rushed to the North Station and walked to the eaves of the ticket office. Only a little more than ten feet away from the ticket office, people were shouting, cursing, and jostling against each other. The black hats walked on the wooden fence, looking down from above as if facing a great enemy, waving their ruthless leather belts, directly striking the travelers' heads, faces, shoulders, and backs indiscriminately. The travelers were screaming and struggling. Some felt hats and top hats were thrown two or three feet away from the crowd. People's faces were beaten until they turned green and purple. I saw an old man in his sixties who was already within the range of this whip's power. No matter where he dodged, there were people everywhere. He could neither move forward nor get out of the line. It was pitiful that he had worked so hard to reach the ticket window, but under the brute force of the leather belt, he had to abandon his original purpose and try to escape. But since he had arrived here, regardless of whether he could buy a ticket or not, the blood on his face was finally beaten out.</p>
<p>I stood in a high place, calmly and clearly watching what tricks were being played in this sea of people. At this time, I turned my eyes to the ticket window, and there was still a black hat squatting there with his feet straddling the wooden fences on both sides. His two hands were using the leather belt to beat the people below him. After the people were beaten and retreated one or two steps, this black hat lowered his head, reached out to the ticket window, and bought three or five tickets at a time. Another black hat was colluding with him, helping each other, to prevent the travelers from approaching the window. He not only used the leather belt to beat them hard, but also kicked and shoved them indiscriminately. People were angrily cursing, dodging, and pushing. At this moment, the black hat bought tickets again and again, and bought them for more than a quarter of an hour. The tickets for various stations must have all been bought. According to my estimates, this person bought at least more than thirty tickets. This is a very alarming number, but I turned my gaze to the sign next to the ticket window that read "One ticket limit per person," and could not help but be stunned. When this black hat bought enough and jumped down triumphantly, the window was immediately closed, and the black curtains were ruthlessly lowered. The sound of "Sold out," "Sold out" was still vaguely transmitted from inside the window. At this time, the remaining black hats and the station police also left triumphantly, leaving behind only those legitimate ticket buyers who were reluctant to leave. According to several people in front of the window, we have been running to buy tickets for four consecutive days. Today, it was hard to be at the very front. I had waited all night since 8:00 PM the night before in the cold wind below zero, and my body was frozen stiff and numb. However, from the opening of the ticket window, I watched helplessly as one black hat after another bought tickets. They could never buy a ticket, and being beaten was unavoidable. The black hats beat others and enriched themselves. At this moment, I discovered that humans were so cruel. On the way home, I silently pondered this case of the black hat beating a traveler to death. It was not an exaggerated report, and society's condemnation of the black hats was not excessive. I wonder what the authorities think about this?</p>
<h3>Forcibly Crossing the Rhine: A Major Battle to Commence; Anglo-American Encirclement Plan Fails</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: German forces continue to bravely engage in rear-guard actions along the Rhine River, preventing enemy troops from crossing. To date, the enemy has not been able to reach the entirety of the riverbank, greatly hindering the progress of their offensive. Although the main force of the German army has retreated to the east bank, German divisions or corps continue to fight on the west bank. Enemy reports acknowledge the failure of the plan to encircle the industrial area. While it seems inevitable that small units of German troops will be trapped, no large units have yet been encircled. It is expected that the upcoming battle will be the second phase of Eisenhower's offensive, primarily focused on forcibly crossing the Rhine River.</p>
<p>Fierce Street Fighting in Cologne - Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: The wide lower reaches of the Rhine River have become the most formidable natural obstacle for Anglo-American forces since landing. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the ruins of Cologne. Enemy troops have penetrated the west railway station and the inner circle of the city. German forces are putting up strong resistance against enemy tanks. The German bridgehead in Düsseldorf is under heavy bombardment from enemy artillery and aircraft, but the situation remains largely unchanged. Near Euskirchen, German forces are being pushed back westward towards the road to Rheinbach. Although fierce fighting continues in the lower reaches of the Rhine, the anti-Axis forces have been unable to achieve their objective of annihilating German forces on the west bank. The fighting south of the lower Rhine is only of a local nature.</p>
<h3>Pomerania: Fluid Warfare Intensifies; Soviet Forces Advance Towards Cammin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: The activities of Soviet forces in Pomerania and West Prussia indicate that a major offensive is imminent. Fluid warfare is intense between the Warta and Vistula rivers. The Soviet offensive from Arnswalde and Kallies has stalled. Fierce fighting has erupted as Soviet forces advance from Neustettin and other locations. Soviet tank units have occupied Köslin and are advancing towards Cammin. Intense fluid warfare is taking place in central Pomerania.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Reuters report states: Soviet forces are reorganizing their units between Görlitz and Lauban, and between Obernigk and Ostrau, preparing to launch a new offensive. In the past 24 hours, Soviet aircraft have heavily bombed Breslau, but infantry attacks have been on a small scale.</p>
<h3>Finnish President Mannerheim Ailing; Refrains from Governing; Contains Political Implications</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A German News Agency report from Helsinki states: Finnish President Marshal Mannerheim is ill, and his duties have been assumed by Prime Minister Paasikivi in accordance with the constitution. On Monday, the president informed the Finnish government through the Minister of Justice that he would be unable to perform his duties from Monday until further notice. The news of the president's illness has caused significant unrest in the Finnish capital.</p>
<p>Further report: Well-informed sources in Stockholm believe that the news of Marshal Mannerheim's illness is politically motivated. Mannerheim may resign from the presidency. Mannerheim commanded the Finnish army during the Finnish-Soviet War. He is a far-right politician and is not welcomed by Moscow.</p>
<h3>The European War Situation After the Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have announced that they have decided to jointly fight against Germany at the Crimean Conference. However, looking at the European war situation after the conference, the biggest focus remains on the Eastern Front. The Zhukov forces on the Berlin front are advancing towards Küstrin on the right flank, and the fighting is quite active, while other areas are relatively stagnant. At the same time, the advance of Konev's forces towards Saxony and the northward advance from the west bank of the Warta River to join forces with Zhukov's forces is very active. Judging from these actions, the Soviet army seems to have no intention of attacking Berlin head-on. According to sources in Berlin, the German authorities also tend to agree with this observation. If the Soviet army avoids a frontal attack on Berlin, the reason would be that major cities can easily be turned into fortified strongholds, and the Germans will turn Berlin into a second Stalingrad. Therefore, they would rather advance deep to the north and south of the city, isolating Berlin and, if possible, encircling it. In addition, they also seem to be trying to have Konev's forces advance into Saxony, first controlling southern Germany. However, the German army detected Konev's movements early and has strengthened the front line in that area. On the 17th, a Soviet frontline report also stated: "Because the resistance of German forces on the Warta River front has been strengthened, some units of the Red Army have retreated from the west bank of the river to the east bank." A noteworthy event in this area was the large-scale bombing of Dresden, Cottbus, and other areas by the British and American air forces on the 15th. This was the first joint operation in which the British and American air forces supported the Soviet army's ground advance. The Soviet authorities announced on the 17th: "In order to ensure close cooperation between the British and American air forces and the Red Army's future offensive, air force generals from Eisenhower's headquarters have been ordered to join the Red Army's general staff and have recently arrived in Moscow." This statement is related to the aforementioned matter and strongly suggests the future direction of British and American bombing of Germany.</p>
<p>Secondly, although no large-scale offensive has begun on the Western Front, as per the initial plan of the Anglo-American forces, preparations are currently underway to break through the northern part of the Siegfried Line. Some believe that a landing operation on the Scandinavian Peninsula may be carried out, but due to the current shortage of ships, it is unlikely that a new operation requiring a large number of ships will be launched. If anything, it would be a landing operation on the coast of the Heligoland Bight, as there is a good chance of approaching the German heartland from there. (Special dispatch from Zurich, 18th) (Translated from the February 10th edition of the Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Director Dai of the Education Bureau Discusses Improving Teacher Treatment; Salaries and Benefits to be Equivalent to Civil Servants</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the improvement in the treatment of municipal primary and secondary school teachers and staff this semester, visited Director Dai of the Education Bureau, who graciously shared his views.</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, they have been deeply concerned about the treatment of teachers and staff and instructed me to adjust the treatment of municipal school staff and workers in accordance with the government's adjustment methods, starting this semester. After receiving the order, I immediately approved the method of paying salaries based on qualifications and determined the salary levels of teachers and staff at various schools to be equivalent to civil servants with the same salary level. For example, a high school normal school graduate who initially becomes a primary school teacher will receive the eighth-grade salary for teachers, with a base salary of 50 yuan, which is equivalent to 17,950 yuan per month for a civil servant. A university education department graduate who initially becomes a primary school teacher will receive the seventh-grade salary for teachers, with a base salary of 60 yuan, which is equivalent to 18,700 yuan per month for a civil servant. Furthermore, a graduate of the education department of a teacher's college who becomes a primary school principal will receive the seventh-grade salary for principals, with a base salary of 70 yuan, which is equivalent to 19,450 yuan per month. A newly appointed primary school principal will receive the seventh-grade salary for principals, with a base salary of 80 yuan, which is equivalent to 20,200 yuan per month. As for the teachers and staff of the former 18 district schools and the two model primary schools in the old Nanshi district, due to their long service, they have been approved to advance one or two grades in salary to general primary schools. Principals of primary schools with six grade levels may advance one grade in salary as encouragement. There are also regulations for secondary schools. The monthly salary of full-time teachers is approximately 25,000 yuan, depending on their qualifications, and starting this semester, a seniority-based salary increase system will be implemented according to the method of paying salaries based on qualifications and length of service. In the past, the salaries of municipal primary school teachers ranged from 8,000 yuan for the highest to only 2,000 yuan for the lowest. According to the current method, the average salary from February will be 18,000 yuan, an increase of approximately three to eight times. In addition to this, all municipal school teachers and staff will be exempt from special allocation of rice, which should be included in the key allocation in the future. The allocation of other daily necessities is also being planned by the goods allocation office. Although the municipal government is facing financial difficulties, it is trying its best to improve the treatment of teachers and staff in order to stabilize the lives of teachers and increase educational efficiency. It is hoped that all our teachers and staff will understand the intentions of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, invigorate their spirits, work hard, respect their positions, strive for improvement, guide young people on the right track, and cultivate excellent academic style in a society full of evils, so as to complete the great mission of this sacred cause in this great era. This is what is greatly hoped for."</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Standardizes Uniform Styles</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau believes that since police administration has been unified, the uniform style should be handled in accordance with the regulations on police uniforms promulgated by the central government. However, it has been found that the uniforms worn by various police officers are not uniform in style and should be corrected to improve appearance. Except that the collar is temporarily allowed to continue using the old style, the shoulder straps should be removed and the edges of the pocket flaps should also be modified for uniformity.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Association Dissolves; Various Branch Offices</h3>

<h3>Case of Young Woman Beaten to Death by Black Hat; Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen's Association Presides Over Justice; Engages a Lawyer to Proceed with Legal Procedures</h3>
<p>The case of Xu Xupingwen, a young woman from Zhenjiang, who was brutally beaten at the North Railway Station on the 4th of this month by Jiang Shiyan, a black-hat employee of the Ye Zhong Railway Company, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving a report from her family, the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association of Zhenjiang was extremely indignant. They unanimously believed that the black hats of the railway were acting lawlessly, committing murder in public. If they were not severely punished according to law, how could the safety of travelers be ensured and the law be maintained? In addition to submitting reports to the Municipal Government, the Local Procuratorate, and the members of the Municipal Advisory Committee, appealing for methods to apprehend the murderer, they also engaged lawyer Chen Rongfa to represent the Fellow Townsmen's Association in assisting the family of the deceased in proceeding with legal procedures. The text of the family's submission to the Fellow Townsmen's Association is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Family's Submission</p>
<p>"Tragically, Xinmao and others are originally from Zhenjiang and currently reside at No. 21, Xindexing Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei District, this city. Recently, due to the dispersal of the population in Shanghai, they planned to send their mother-in-law and three-year-old daughter back to their hometown in Zhenjiang. On the morning of March 4th at 2:00 AM, they instructed their sister-in-law, Xu Peiwwen, 25 years old, to go to ticket office No. 4 at the North Railway Station to buy tickets and wait for daybreak at 7:00 AM. Unexpectedly, she was inexplicably beaten by Jiang Shiyan, a railway black hat. When the sister-in-law tried to reason, he became even more fierce and grabbed her hair, dragging her horizontally into his office, where he locked the door and savagely beat her with fists and feet, causing severe injuries all over her body. Then, the head of the assailant, Li Yixian, and Zhou Shunchu and others, without authorization, hired a car to send the sister-in-law to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Bazilu Road. At that time, although Xinshun had rushed to the scene after hearing the news, not knowing the details, he was also detained by many people, preventing him from reporting to the police, so that the murderer took the opportunity to escape, which is extremely hateful. Later, after the doctor's diagnosis, it was found that the injuries were too severe and very dangerous. After performing an abdominal surgery to remove the kidney, it was found to have been beaten into two pieces. She tragically passed away at 1:45 AM on March 5th. At that time, the North Railway Station branch bureau had received the report, but because the murderer had escaped, they could not be apprehended. They then requested the Huazhong Railway Authority to hand over the guarantor of the murderer, but to no avail. The bureau then dispatched personnel to detain Li Yixian, Zhou Shunchu, and others who had instigated the murderer and investigated day and night, but to no effect. Xinmao and others were faced with the tragedy of family destruction and death when the dispersal failed. If the murderer is allowed to remain at large, how can the wronged soul be appeased? Therefore, we plead and earnestly request your Fellow Townsmen's Association, based on its position of upholding the interests of fellow townsmen, to uphold justice and appeal to all circles to rise up and lend their support, to ensure that the murderer is brought to justice to comfort the wronged soul and revitalize discipline. We anxiously await your decision. Xu Xinmao, Shun respectfully present."</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Reliance on Britain and America Will Lead to Tragedy; Minister Ide Reveals Enemy America's Ambitions</h3>
<p>The Allied Japanese Army News Department held a regular news conference at Hamilton House yesterday (the 7th) at 3:00 PM. Minister Ide attended and elaborated on America's ambitions toward Chongqing, stating that their intentions would cause Chongqing to suffer a tragic fate in great detail. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>Enemy America Plans to Increase War Expenditure</p>
<p>The minister began by saying: Recently, enemy America has planned to increase war expenditures against Japan, create a Pacific Air Force, strengthen Pacific air defense supply bases, hold Pacific war zone conferences, and establish a Pacific Front Command, etc., demonstrating its active approach to the war against Japan. Enemy America is also increasing its encouragement of Chongqing, because the Japanese army's operations on the Chinese mainland, since occupying Guilin, have formed a connected continental posture, making the East Asian war situation increasingly worse. However, the formation of the above situation is due to the chaos of Chongqing's military and political affairs and the lack of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Therefore, Chongqing's responsibility in East Asia needs to be re-examined. Now, America is contacting Yan'an on the one hand and adopting a policy of reconciliation with Chongqing to deal with Japan on the other, providing Chongqing with economic assistance with the goal of increasing military supplies.</p>
<p>Cooperation with Chongqing Interferes with Internal Affairs</p>
<p>However, America's cooperation with Chongqing and interference in its internal affairs is nothing more than manipulating Chongqing. The Chongqing regime has always been deluded by the dream of relying on Britain and America, believing in the propaganda that enemy forces are victorious in the Philippines, and thinking that the defeat of the Japanese army is imminent. They have mistakenly resisted Japan, causing the people to suffer for eight years. Currently, Chongqing is planning to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield for the post-Philippine victory against Japan. This is the highest point of Chongqing's reliance on Britain and America. However, Chongqing scolds [Chiang Kai-shek] for being obsessed with British and American policies, which is the tragedy of the Chongqing regime. Chongqing also hopes to rely on Britain and America to clean up the domestic mess after the victory of the anti-Axis powers. Look at the situation of small countries after being occupied or managed by the British and American empires. For example, the Badoglio regime initially planned to surrender to Britain and America to obtain liberation, but unexpectedly entered the entanglement of the three countries. Moreover, in southern Italy under anti-Axis occupation, there is widespread hunger, unemployment, crime, and prostitution. Poland has become a living drama of the struggle for power among the three countries. Unless Poland acts as a defeated country, there is no other way. Furthermore, the internal strife in Greece, the riots in Bulgaria, the predicament of France, etc., make it easy to see the dead end of relying on the anti-Axis powers without one's own strength.</p>
<p>Britain and America Have Many Internal Difficulties</p>
<p>Britain and America also have many internal problems, such as the sluggishness of military production and the difficulty of replenishing manpower, which are very serious. In particular, the lack of human resources in the United States has created a huge potential crisis for the future of military production. The United States, in view of the tense situation in the Western European war and the bloody battle of the Japanese army in East Asia, the more human resources are consumed and the more difficult it is to extend the supply line, so it applies fourth-F-class (weak) people to war.</p>
<p>Britain and America have always incited other countries through charitable undertakings or the quality production of money and goods, etc., to achieve their own interests. Now Chongqing overestimates Britain and America, and the result will be a tragic tragedy, sharing the same fate as the small countries of Europe. According to the lessons of history, the survival of a nation depends on the unity of the same nation and the effort to regenerate, which determines its future and destiny.</p>
