<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>對疏散學校問題之　我見</h3>
<p>— 戴英夫</p>
<p>我認爲疏散學校的意義，是積極的，絕不能看作純然是消極的卑怯者的避難行爲，當然，爲了維護第二代靑年，保持國家民族的一些元氣，儘可能避免作敵機官襲下的無謂犧牲者，固有其疏散的必要：但我認爲除此之外，更有其敎育上的積極理由。</p>
<p>上海不是理想中最好　學的地方，敎育家都有這種看法，可是上海的學校特別多，而由於過去租界的罪惡以及商業資本的作崇，使上海教育，受了種種的誘惑與影響，免不了一部份是變了質，這是無可諱言的，所以我們是應該於積極的維持上海敎育之中，來謀上海敎育的改革，不是，不是僅爲一地，我們應從大處，從小處近處着手，因爲上海敎育的成功與失敗，是足以影響整個敎育的前途的。</p>
<p>因此，疏散學校問題，應看作上海敎育上的一種改革，而置重點於積極的意幾之上。</p>
<p>我們如果計劃到一個適合疏散的地點，創造了一個新的敎育環境，大可切切實實地來辦理理想中的教育，——適合中國本位的敎育，這裏，有竹籬茅舍，可以做我們的課室宿舍，有田園土地，可以給我們耕種自食，可以辦小工業，製造日用品，可以辦醫院，確保衛生與疾病之治療，有許多專家敎授，有許多優秀靑年，學農好，學工也好，學醫也好，一面學，一面實習，一面勞動，一面生產，過着共同的生活，負起共同的使命，養成眞正擔當復興中華保衛東亞的中國靑少年。當然，下面的幾點，是首先要辦到的：</p>
<p>（一）敎師與學生，均須具有這種認識與決心；</p>
<p>（二）敎師的直系家屬，應隨同疏散；</p>
<p>（三）政府籌撥大宗經費辦理此事。</p>
<p>根據上面的意見，首先疏散理工學院，醫學院，農學院等。國立大學之屬於此類者，當先疏散。私立專科以上學校，先創設一聯立大學於疏散地點，遜一部份員生前往，重要設備，全部遷去；上海本校，暫時保持，必要時全部遷往。大學之文法商學院以及普通中學之高中部師艇學校高級職業學校，亦應預爲準備，逐步疏散。至於中小學生隨同家人疏散回籍後的辦法，我對平報社記者，已經提起過，茲不贅述。</p>
<p>在這新的敎育環境中，敎育上的一切設施，可以重新做起，過去的缺點，自然會一律革除，破壞便是建設，我可斷言於疏散學校中，會得到敎育上的新的成就。</p>
<p>首都通訊</p>
<h3>首都新春花絮</h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>在首都，一年一度的春節，絡外點綴了一片的昇平氣象，好像火藥氣息完全嗅不瑪了。</p>
<p>秦淮燈市</p>
<p>秦淮河畔的人頭，當春節來臨的時候，就一天擠似一天，那種熱鬧，更比往年越來越盛了。誰說戰時物力艱難，生活高漲，他們依舊在消費，依舊在享樂。五色繽紛的花燈，又和往年一樣高矗雲霄，在泮宮前的兩列排得齊齊的，一串一串的吊着在爭奇鬥勝！在這百物高漲的時代，花燈也一般地水漲船高，喊至數百元至數千元一盞，可是依然還找得到他的主顧，本來中國人是最愛熱鬧的，尤其在這個六朝烟水之地的秦淮河畔。</p>
<p>節景點滴</p>
<p>夫子廟的一帶，就是首都民衆熱鬧的中心，有電影院，京戲院，話劇，所特殊的就是淸唱，在這幾天裏可說無不日夜滿座，其中生意最好的當然是電影院了，因爲是價廉物美，在這裏所異於他處的，就長軍人的特別優待，祇要化普通人五分之一的代價就可以買到一張軍人票，可是却沒有不購票而入塲的。</p>
<p>正常娛樂以外，當然一樣地有着不芷當的娛樂，其實該是普通的娛樂，借了春節的機會，大家小戶，無不有睹具之聲，雖然還沒有大規模的賭仍然透不過氣來。他們日常所需的柴米油鹽，那樣不貴，最低級的家庭一月開支，也得要數萬元，就是一個人力車天，誰不是每天必需要獲有二千塊錢才能過活，當然公務員的生活，雖然一再提高待遇，還是列於最低級的消費者之中的。</p>
<p>當局爲了顧及民生，改善民生，已組有「首都物資平價維紀委員會」塲，然而那種不下數百萬輸贏的塲面，却畸形地存在着這個光明的都市，被逍遙於當局嚴行禁賭的法網之外。</p>
<p>物價的話</p>
<p>雖然已是不希罕一擲十萬的今日，可是終究還祇限於特殊的階級，一般平民生活，還是受着物價的脅迫而，嚴行物價的管理，對於柴米等八項生活必需品限價的執行，尤其雷厲風行，並且在廢曆的年底，已收有相當的效果。號是各處城關以及車站碼頭軍警的勒索，也已澈底取締，滬者處以極刑，已有兩起在雨花台槍泱了。因爲從二月份起全市軍警已由當局撥有專款，每一個人的直屬家屬每兩人給與一萬元的生活補助金，人口再多，補助金也遞加，並且萬一將來物價高漲，也得隨時坩加。</p>
<p>這種辦法的施行，給予首都市民的期望甚大，但是在新春各業半休息狀態之下，物價的波騰，似乎又在暗中活躍了，雖然當局已公布米價不得超過兩萬元關，可一向遍地黑市米的首都，却也絕了跡，同時食油的價格也由四百餘元一捭飛漲至八百餘元一斤，據說是來源不濟的綠故。還有蔬菜的昻貴也駭人聽聞，動輒要數百元一斤，柴軍也是不容易買到的一件事。</p>
<p>最近因爲銀樓第一天開市，黃金就掛了三十萬元一兩的行市，於是各業紛紛藉口漲價，全市大廉價的商店，奚止千百，究竟不過是一層幌子而已。</p>
<p>安定民生己經當局列入重要施政之一，並且具有最大的決心，而以首都爲試金石，人民正拭目以待呢！</p>

<p>市建設局成立經過</p>
<p>本人此次奉命担任建設局長，視事以后，均遵市長之命，實施行政簡素化之原則，本局內部調整，大致就緒，預定日內繼續接收附屬機關，從事調整工作。關於合併兩局及成立建設局經過，本人於奉命之後，當即將兩局過去本身工作，評爲查察，公用局方面，過去側重水電交通等之管理，而工務局則重於路政建築之技術工作，雙力頗有工作相同之處，但仍有其獨特性，故對建設局設科方面，詳加考慮之結果，共設六科，以使其發揮固有工作之上效能。幷遵照市府之簡素原則，兩局員工減少三分之一，以求人盡其材。然此次本局雖裁去三分之一亢員，但本身工作，仍照常進行，期以最少之人力，獲得最大之工作效能。至于被裁員工均遵照市府辦法除將三月份薪水照常發給外，復遵照市府規定，一月份應得之薪給，發給三個月，以資遺散，此爲成立建設局之經過。至今後建設局工作，除發揮過去兩局之原有工作外，幷以着重道路修築工程爲中心，以資協助疏散人口之準備，</p>
<p>是項工作不日當付實施。</p>

<h3>新協滬分會昨舉行　神鷲歌演奏會　歌聲雄偉聽者動容</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會，前爲發揚盟邦日本空車戰士之偉績，特公開徵求神鷲讚美歌詞，並將入選前三名作品，敦請名家譜詞，該分會並爲廣使羣衆得聆神鷲讚美歌曲，表揚「神風精神」起見，特於昨（三）日下午五時，假外灘華懋飯店舉行神鷲讚美歌演奏會，到有該分會理事長陳彬龢，常務理事陳日平，理事魯風朱永康等，中日各界來貧到大使館松平情報部長，艦隊報道部松島報道部長，松本大尉，平田大尉，中川中尉，林俊夫，坂爪，王炳南，劉鎭南等二千餘人。首由陳彬龢報吿，繼請松島部長演請，詞畢，好開始演奏，計第一部中日歌曲與神鷲讚美歌，中日歌曲服部良一指揮，神鷲讚美歌由陳歌辛揮揮，歌聲雄偉，聽者動容，繼即開始　　　　　　　，未放映戰事影片畢散會。茲錄演詞曁神鷲讚美歌原詞於後：</p>
<p>陳理事長詞「去年冬天，敵美在太平洋蠶動以來，盟邦陸海航空部隊，以一人一機一艦主義，組織神風特別攻繫隊，繼續不斷的在台灣菲律賓方面，建立不朽的功績，這是大東亞十億國民精神的總表率，名之曰「神風精神」。神風隊的誔生，遠在六百七十年前，元兵由蒙古襲繫日本，忽起狂風，將元朝兵船吹倒海中，元十萬之衆，生還者僅三人，當時日本名之爲「神風」。一種精神，特別是神風精神，不是臨時可以鍛練成就的，也不是隨便所能表現的，盟邦發動大東亞戰爭，在這方面有了久長的準備，這次大東亞戰爭中所表之的神風精神，即是神風特別攻繫隊，他們出發以後，不欲生還，英勇繫減敵艦，揚其神風，即以少數兵力，戰勝多數兵力，達到最後勝利。本會鑒於此種神風精神，有宣揚光大之必要，有在後方各種戰時工作上推動之必要，去年十二月間前上海新聞聯合會特公開徵求「神鷲讚美歌詞」應徵者非常踴躍，最後選取勵漢英，謝君偉，周愛江三位，予以獎金，歌詞於一月九日在各報發表，復陋陳歌辛顏頡兩先生作曲，今天演奏以後，廣流民間，希望在中國後方各地戰時工作上能表現出神風精神。」</p>
<p>松島部長詞</p>
<p>「今天新聞協會主持舉行神鷲讚美歌演奏會，承諸位撥冗參加，不勝感激。茲對主持者及參加各位表示謝忱。</p>
<p>忠勇烈士</p>
<p>去歲十月二十五日菲島方面續戰期中，海空作戰正趨熾烈之時，我海陸特別攻繫隊相繼出現於雷伊泰島方面，從天際出以降魔之利劍，使敵寒心，獲致必中必殺之效果，諒在座諸位早已周知。邇來戰局日趨發展，於本年一月初旬敵踏上呂宋島後，决戰更形烈，該時起迄一月止，特攻隊所獲單績，計繫沉戰艦航空母艦等艦艇八十二艘，並繫毀其七十五艘，予敵如此重大打繫，全出於陸海特攻隊以身與愛機拚撞敵艦所致。日軍勇士以身殉國之忠烈精神，誠古今無比者，此即孔子所謂殺身成仁的愛國精神，當然這不外乎中日兩國人民對大東亞建設所表現的民族性。</p>
<p>有利態勢</p>
<p>近來戰局敵專恃物量，急於結束戰事，反覆出諸無謀的流血作戰，但正中日本的誘導戰術。從大局上看，日本正一時忍受着戰術上的不利，逐步獲得戰略上的有利態勢，並完成最後勝昨之準備。在呂宋島方面，敵人自一月九日以來，歷時已近二月，彼等迭受空前流血，雖然已傾注兵力十八師團，然戰局的進展，猶非容易，遂於二月十九日在硫黃島登陸，然在該方面亦受我猛力抵抗，再度遭遇太平洋戰爭開始以來未曾過有的大流血。截至今日，登陸兵力約四萬五千名，估計至少已死傷三分之一。據敵方消息每一分鐘喪失二名，誠如敵海兵隊指揮官所稱「在創立海兵隊以來之一百六十八年歷史上，最慘烈的戰鬥」。吾人觀察馬尼剌攻防戰的經過，亦同樣情形，敵似乎逐步逼近我內圈，但結果亦不免大量流血，致使人力資源的接濟大受障礙。徵諸美陸長史汀生所稱，亦可明瞭。敵人一步步接近我日本本土，自日本言乃意料中之預定戰略，由此而進入繫滅敵人的階段，在此時期內，我日本採取與過去逈然不同的戰略思想，充實最配備與戰力，深信必能於最後階段繫減敵人。</p>
<p>特攻精神</p>
<p>今日我日本舉國人民，澈底發揮特攻精神，努力求戰事的必勝。且特攻精神，不論於前綫或後方，擴充到政治，經濟，思想等各方面，日漸化成不敗的戰力。新聞協會以神鷲讚美歌作曲吿成，訂於今日作首次演奏，此於中日其同作戰上實含有深長意義，本人深信必能奏極大功效。最後再對關係各位之辛苦，表示十二分的謝意。」</p>

<h3>殖民地的叛離與英美蘇關係</h3>
<p>賴債老手</p>
<p>貿易，海運及海外投資旣已全無起死回生的手段，則在英國手中所有的，不過是多年來執國際政治經濟牛耳的經騐及與其有表裏關係的面子而已。而由狡獪的權謀術數彌補其實力之所不逮，可說是僞善的英國特擅的看家本領。</p>
<p>一九四三年十二月南非聯邦總理斯麥資在倫敦發表的有名演說中，於承認和美蘇兩國比較，英國的國力已顯著低下的事實之後，提出一個對抗的方策，即：糾合西歐各國於自己的傘下。由這些西歐各國及英國自治領殖民地重組過去所謂金鎊集團，假其力以與美蘇兩國並駕齊驅，想必就是英國將來的政策基調。</p>
<p>英國死守金鎊集團的方針，由一九四四年十月九日安達遜財相於下院答覆議員質問的言辭中也可明白窺知。即安達遜財相除暗示布闌頓森林會議的戰後國際通貨案係缺乏實行可能性的理想案之外，並云：</p>
<p>「關於因戰爭而起的對外債務問題及戰後過渡期各種問題的必要措置，與英國及他國作爲最後目標而追求的國際機構安定，其間有截然的區別。各國現於倫敦所有英鎊資金的處理問題，屬於前者的範疇。」</p>
<p>再看「財政新聞」的論調吧。</p>
<p>「關於各國封鎖在倫敦的英鎊資金，由法律上言，將來應由通常的國際金融往來處分之。但若承認此種主張，則英國於此戰中除喪失對外投資的大部分以外，尙須負擔二十億鎊的外債，即背負二倍以上於第一次大戰戰債的債務。……當然，對於中立國的戰債，自必承認由通常的方法償還之。但對於其他各國，封鎖英鎊資金的處分應用與中立國不同的方法行之。……蓋英國的戰債不僅爲英國本身，也是爲其他反軸心國全體或美國及屬領各國而遂行必要的戰爭所生者。」</p>
<p>說明白一點，就是向你們借來的錢是爲你們用掉的，未便當作普通借款。英國的態度不是比慣於賴債的人更刮皮嗎？英政府的發表「破產白皮書」，眞意即在這裏。</p>
<p>如意算盤</p>
<p>最能反映個中消息的，就是在最近布蘭頓森林反戰心通貨會議上大事討論的關於印度在英資金的處理問題。印度所有的英鎊資金，據稱已達七億二千萬鎊，此數的佔英國所有封銷資金的過半吧。這是英國用戰後賦以自治領地位的已在前次大戰時用過的空頭支票，以及武力的彈壓，使印度民衆沉淪於飢餓及窮困的深淵中而拿去的食糧。軍需品的代價。而且，英國在這期間簡直沒有供給印度物資，結果印度物資涸竭的情形殊爲可怖。因此，印度自由處分英鎊資金，換爲美元或黃金，以謀恢復其國富，也是理所當然的吧。</p>
<p>「對此，英國方面印度消費財現貨確巳大大減少；這是世界性的現象，不獨是印度一國。去年的食糧飢饉曾惹起了艱難的事態，但這是一般民衆藏匿食糧及地方機關無能的結果，並非英國收買過度所致。」</p>
<p>英國一方面如此吶喊，一方面則造成種種口實，如：現在英鎊對盧比的匯兌換算率無關印度的高物價；英國在印度國防費上的負祖因已增大故非改訂一九三九年的協定不可等等；由此設法不令印度所有的英鎊資金在金鎊集團之外處分。而英國眞正的用意，則在將來由匯兌手法抹殺上述英鎊資金，以謀用僅少的代價從印度民衆那裏榨取得來的物資高價拋出。「財政新開」曾率直叙述如次：</p>
<p>「此等英鎊資金的使用，僅得利用爲向英國購買物資的資金，或轉匯金鎊領域內。倘若各國所有英鎊資金如此仍有剩餘，則列爲對英無息債權而存置之，限於各國對外支付手段拮据時始許挪用。」</p>
<p>這眞是實足十的如意算盤！不過，美國姑置不論，在中立國及自治領殖民地中，英國關於債務予以金的類的保障者，僅一阿根廷耳，所以對於金鎊集團的各國，多少將發生這個問題吧。唯視對手國的力量如何，英國態度可有緩急之差罷了</p>
<p>眾親叛離</p>
<p>在這樣的現狀之下，英帝國內各自治領殖民地的逐漸背離本國，實無足異。英國對於印度英鎊資金的熊度等，也是知道此種趨勢之存在的英國在無可奈何下的一種掙扎。可是，印度已不再相信戰後畀以自治領地位的陳舊空頭支票，切實要求實際的東西。</p>
<p>「前大戰中，印度自一九一七年以降曾給與英國的一億鎊的捐款……和平降臨時更予以巨額獻金。但在這次大戰中，因在印度內部有非常劇烈的反英政治門爭，殊無再捐助二次的端倪。」</p>
<p>印度對英更趨於不合作，今日還有一個另外的理由，就是美國的勢力已在開始浸潤印度了。美國之覬覦印度市塲，殊無可疑，其所以屢對英國的印度政策抱批判的態度，即因具此用心也。美英兩國，固爲一丘之貉，然美國開始接近印度時印度亦欣然向之，實因印度也想利用美英兩國的對立。這點使英國變成非常神經質，所以如最近的費立浦斯事件一樣，美人一插嘴印度的統治便怒跳起來。</p>
<p>其次，加拿大又如何？此國由於戰爭之故，在政治上經濟上依存美國的傾向也日益加强了，及至最近，與其說是英帝國內的一分子，毋寗說是以英美兩國間的橋樑自任。一九四四年五月的英吉利聯邦首相會議中，加拿大首相金格即說：「加拿大是連絡新世界和舊世界的環。加拿大由神聖的紐帶和母國連繫，由深切的親善關係和美國相連。」澳洲和新西闌今日也不獨在軍事上經濟上依存美國，且未忘能大東亞戰爭初期兩國瀕於空前危機時英國並未有所協助的事實。南非對英比較有些好意，但也和印度一同主張恢復金本位，因而在通貨政策上與英國對立。結果，大次大擂的英聯邦首相會議等，雖含有是一種親善姿勢的意味，但却沒有什麽具體的成效，同床異夢之觀，在所難免。通　大英帝國的紐帶，和英國希望相反，今後將更鬆弛吧。</p>
<p>再則，最近紛紛議論的西歐集團案，雖爲英國所囑望，但蘇聯和美國巳表示反對，尤其蘇聯，以此爲反蘇的舉止，嚴加非難。觀乎法國等利用此稱情勢而發動以夷制夷的外交等事實，可知西歐各國也未必比英帝國自治領更爲親英。</p>
<p>自掘墓墳</p>
<p>國內正困於勞動階級實力增大及自治殖民地離叛的英國，在國外又苦於反軸心陣營內美蘇兩國勢力的擴張，然而又非繼續戰爭不可。英國對德宣戰的理由是保障波蘭的國境，但今日對於蘇聯佔波蘭領土爲已有，却茫然不知所爲。對於巴爾幹，戰前英國也有重大利害關係，現在却無法阻止其逐漸淪入蘇聯的勢力下，僅汲汲於保衛地中海路綫。在美國國內，有種種議論，如現在向英國借來的飛行基地戰後仍繼續借用啦等等，更甚的甚至主張英國合併於美國。英國對此也無法大加抗議。邱吉爾頻頻問候羅斯福和斯太林，三拜九叩，力圖保全自己的勢力圈，即是英國現在的態度。</p>
<p>這無非是開戰以來一味利用他人的英國自作之孽。牽制德國力量於東方而使英國有暇喘息者，就是蘇聯的抗戰。對此，英國答允的第二戰線却遲遲未見開關。挽回其大西洋運輸線的危機者，即係美國航空母艦的護送；供給英國軍械食糧而使其能够繼續戰爭者，則爲租軍法案。就是現在的第二戰線，若不依仗美國的力量，也不會實現的。然而，英國一面利用美國的物資，一而却想阻止美國勢力闌入大英帝國，甚至想將西歐各國拉入自己的傘下。誠然，正如發表「破產白皮書」時英國情報相勃籣登。布勒坎所述，英國在戰爭中「已犧牲維多利亞朝以來遺產的大半」，但英國却不想自已努力，只望利用他人來恢復其損失。旣已失却實力而猶圖保存昔日的勢力範圍，恐除叩頭於美蘇兩國之前以外，另無他法。</p>
<p>走向滅亡之路誠然廣矣！一面用威嚇和懷柔壓榨大英帝國的自治領殖民地，一面趨炎附勢，仰美蘇兩國的鼻息，常由利用他人以謀本身利益的這種便宜政策，將是誘導英國滅亡的基本因素。過去的英國，曾有雄飛七海的氣慨。迨坐擁廠大的海外投資而依利息爲生時，英國只汲汲於保全身家。今日的英國，却不充分認識實力衰退的現實，夢想一去不再返的黃金時代。所謂亡秦者秦也，古羅馬帝國的崩潰，即因羅馬人本身頹廢之故；使大英帝國滅亡者亦將是英吉利自己吧！（完）（譯自第二十五卷第五十一號同盟世界週報）</p>
<p>交戰各國因技術和設計交流的結果，小型機的形態幾乎相同，甚難區別。從地上判別時，第一須熟知敵友雙方飛機的平面型，茲以此爲主，將幾種日美小型似。至其水平尾翼，大體與主翼相彷，垂直尾翼的形狀，地上頗難判別，唯在垂直旋回等時，可注意之。其次，因垂直尾翼遠在水平尾翼後方，所以機體似乎甚白。</p>
<p>日本的「飛燕」戰鬥機，因是唯一的水冷式，機首尖細，比諸「隼」。「鍾馗」或海軍零式戰鬥機頗具纖細之感，極易判別。其主尾翼的間隔極小。福特。雪戈斯基Ｆ４Ｕ戰鬥機的主翼，兩端上翹，從前方看，成Ｗ形。至其平面型，則頗平凡。又其垂直尾翼則出冰平尾翼之後。道格拉斯ＳＢＤ３翼輻一二·六五米機的形式說明如下：</p>
<p>日本的「鍾馗」戰鬥機，主翼前綠成一直綫，後綠向兩端成弧形，不像美機格拉曼Ｆ６Ｆ主翼前後緣向兩端斜削，而與寇蒂斯ＳＢ２Ｃ相長。Ｇ　般地說，飛機的頭部因裝有馬力大直徑巨的發動機，機體勢必粗大，唯視主翼和水平尾翼的間隔如何，可使人感到或組或細，這點須仔細硏究圖形才可明翼前綠亦成直綫，後綠向前傾斜，兩端帶圓味，和格拉曼Ｆ６Ｆ等兩端成角形者不同。</p>
<p>美機寇蒂斯ＳＢ２Ｏ是複座機，主翼和「鍾馗」極類似，但與水平，比一般戰鬥機稍大，主翼和尾翼間的機身較細，尾向上翹。最後是格拉曼Ｆ６Ｆ，其形殊爲滑稽，頗似啤酒桶上裝了一塊洗衣板，最易區別。（文及圖均根據二月十九日每日新聞</p>
<p>上海市政　周　　題　第四期</p>
<p>疏散工作之實施步驟</p>
<p>— 育德</p>
<p>大規模疏散人口是件　複的工作，在目前緊迫的時局需要下，尤盼能迅速實現。現在姑就時間先後，分四個步驟略爲　見：</p>
<p>第一個步驟在於登記調查，在這期間，一面應由全市保甲組織，依照統一的格式，登記所轄聯保內自願疏散者的情形，如疏散人數，目的地，行李件數及經濟能力等。一面應由疏散委會協同各同鄕會調查各交通線的運輸能力，主要疏散目的地之物價，治安及容納可能情形，以便統盤籌劃調度。</p>
<p>第二個步驟在於組織接洽。訊織方而，有同鄉會的應劃歸同鄉會辦理，無同鄕會的市民應由疏散委會依照目的地分隊，指定各隊迎絡指揮的負實者。接洽方面，如車船班次的增加，票價的減低，檢查手續的簡單化與限制之放寬。凡此都須於疏散前辦妥，以免臨時混亂擁擠。</p>
<p>第三個步驟是實行疏散。如疏散蹬件之發給，戶口之集體報出，交通工具之合理支配，團體軍船票之購買，護送人員之分配，然後始分批起程。手續務求簡單，辦理務求迅速。</p>
<p>第四個步驟是善後。疏散工作的目的不僅在解決交通運輸的困難，還應顧到被疏散者疏散以後的生活問題，否則上海的疏散結果造成了各地嚴重的社會問題；因此在各主要疏散目的地，還須由疏散委會聯絡當地政府及公團，組織臨時性的機構，對於解決房屋租賃之糾紛，戶口之申報，職業之介紹，以及臨時救濟等，作切實而有效的協助。</p>
<p>目前時勢如此緊張，空襲的可能如此之大，米糧價格如此之高，凡無居留上海必要的市民，無不希望疏散早日實行。非常時期祗有用非常的辦法，要避免過去行政上所取的繁複手續，凡事求其敏捷完善，祗有在減少被疏散者病苦這一點上，爭取疏散工作的成功。疏散工作兩前提</p>
<h3>交通與治安　疏散工作兩前提</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠華</p>
<p>自敵機屢次轟炸後，市民鑒於空襲之可怖，加以目前生活不易維持，市民願自動疏散到較安全的地方——鄕村者甚多。何如黑市車票船票難購，及紅黑帽子的敲詐，鄕村治安的不良，在在使自動疏散者欲行又止。今市政當局，對於疏散人口，已有疏散人口委員會之組織，申報特闢上海市政欄，徵詢市民之意見，籍供當局之參考，筆者願就市民之立塲，不揣冒昧，聊作蒭認之獻。</p>
<p>增加運輸工具，消滅黑市，爲疏散人口之先決條件，苟二者不能辦到，疏散工作自難達圓滿之成績可以斷言。像最近航行滬甬間者，僅「寗紹」一隻，如以一個月開往寗波七次，每次乘客以七千人計，一月內不過五萬人耳。又如火車黑市車票，聞已售至萬餘，姑且疏散一家以四人計，大小行李以五件計，車票一項，需款五萬，行李每件以四千計，需款二萬，加以車僮之敲詐，沿途之勒索，則一家之疏散，非十萬金莫辦。設若薪水階級，焉能負擔此巨額費用。是故當局之疏散人口工作，對於上述二大問題，亟應先爲解泱。</p>
<p>頻歲以還，鄕間盜賊蜂起，治安不良。蓋戰時百業凋零，失業日衆，物價騰貴，生計日逼，不得已淪爲盜賊者，大不乏人。然政治之未上軌道，任令貧墨官吏，流氓地痞，到處橫行，要亦爲其主因。像筆者鎭海戚家已被槍四次之多，可見一斑。今當局疏散人口，開先自無業游民着手，彼輩設疏散至鄕問，如無適當處置辦法，適足擾亂地方，筆者深望當局於疏散游民之際，三復考慮，以求盡善。</p>
<p>鄙邑新老周，爲鎭海大鎭之一，昔者住戶數千，爲各鄕之冠，今則十室九空，悽凉不堪言喻。蓋以政治不良，雈符遍野，搶奪之風，日有所聞，村民不勝威脅，大都遷往都市，來滬居住者亦不乏人，敝處旣然，他鄕何獨不然？是故疏散人口時，對鄕村治安，尤望當局善自爲之。</p>
<h3>保甲人員之待遇</h3>
<p>— 黃恭安</p>
<p>上海之保甲組織，迄今已二年有餘，二年之中，雖不敢言對社會有若干實獻，但盜賊消弭，奸邪伏法，自警自衛，治安之維持，防空之推動及其他一切民衆組織，保甲盡了最大的努力。</p>
<p>保甲是政府和人民的通繫，上則推行法令，傳遞，執行政府政策，下則傳達民意，貢獻檢討民衆之要求，協力推進市政。保甲是人民的組織，協助政府，維持社會秩序，扶助善良，剷除奸惡，爲公衆服務的機關。</p>
<p>周市長說：「保甲組織應推行政府，以協助政府」。又說：「今後市府配給物品，希望保甲協助」。「羅秘書長說：「保甲協助軍警，尙有成績，而一切不良份子之檢舉，自待於保甲自警之協力，保甲有監督檢舉社會一切罪行之責」。</p>
<p>保甲所負的責任，旣是如此重大，而其工作上對得住國家，下對得起民衆。但是直接從事保甲工作者的生活怎樣，待我們來硏究一下。</p>
<p>在租界收回以前，法租界的聯保，每月有四百五十元津貼，作爲辦公費，而辦事員的新給也就在這裏面支付。租界收回後，侮一聯保之辦公費增加到一千五百元，但歷久不發，到三十三年七月份，統一徵收保甲經費後，每一聯保得辦公費七千五百元一月，每一保亦得辦公費五千元一月，但其保及聯保之範圍均加擴大，的爲前之七倍，而前所欠發之經費則一筆句銷，不再言及。</p>
<p>每一保長，多設立一保辦事處，僱用辦事員一人至二人，辦公費中除去墨水，文具，紙張等必需品一二千元外，己只餘三四千元，何况上級還要七零八碎的扣除，辦事員只能在這扣除的殘屑中，得到一二千元作爲每月的生活費，作爲勤勞一月之代價。聯保方面，因爲印刷物的增加，除餘下來，每個辦事員也只能得到這一點兒。</p>
<p>卅四年起，保甲處雖然增高了保甲費，預備使辦公費增加二倍，以改善保甲人員之待遇，但增加之後，每一保可得一萬五千元一月，每一聯保每月二萬二千五百元。即使不除任何開支。全部作爲辦事員津貼，侮人所得不過七千五百元，在生活程度飛漲之今日，良善者另謀他就，或兼就副業；奸惡者利用職權，敲詐良民，使民衆對保甲畏懼或厭煩。保甲工作今日之不積極，即在這種情形下產生。</p>
<p>日來政府當局勵行肅淸貪汚，建立廉潔政治，而與人民直接接觸，有莫大關係的保甲，竟產生這種情形，誠令人痛心，固然「治亂世，用重刑。」但是總不能枵腹從公，總得要吃飽肚子，穿暖身體才能做事。</p>
<p>今日，我們不敢再要求增加辦公費，而免提高人民所付的保甲費以擾民；但希望政府當局，在施行重點配給的時候，把我們例入公務人員之內，一律發給重點配給，而安定生活，在保甲的本位上努力。</p>
<h3>限價與拒售</h3>
<p>在物價不住上漲聲中，最近上海經濟局評定十六種商品的限價，而我們看到新限價的通告，好像所規定的價格，並不十分低。可知當局對於各物的成本，商人的利潤，各方面都顧到，並不可算不合理，不公允。</p>
<p>然而在商人方面，對於經濟局所評定的限價，還有許多以爲太低，不能獲得暴利，心有未足。而在經濟局嚴令，不得超限出售下，又不敢公然表示反對，或私自抬價出售。可是商人自有商人的方法和手段，就是拒售，他們覺得新限價不足滿他們發財慾，便把貨品囤數起來，實行拒售。</p>
<p>此中最顯著者，便是食油，新限價侮市斤六百二十元，在未公佈前，食油到處可以買瑪，一經公佈，走到油店門口，齊了心，都銳汕已售罄。雖然有的油店，在常局監視下，在出售限價油，每人半斤，因爲地方不多，又發現了長蛇陣軋汕的現象。</p>
<p>我們可以斷定多數油店，他們油是有着，祇因以限價不能滿足他們的慾望而藏着拒售。食油是市民日常必需之品，不可缺少，現在戶口油旣不能按期配給，而黑市食油，又被商人拒售，市民已有無汕之苦。</p>
<p>此一問題，如果任其延長下去，那壓市民的食油，將日見恐慌。我以爲當局除了執行新限價之外，應更進一步，澈底調查油商，油店的存汕，如發現囤油而拒售者，予以嚴懲重罰。否則限價儘管限價，商人以爲限價太低時，會來一個拒售，而除了食油之外，十六種新限價貨品，說不定更有其他貨物也照食油之法，實行拒售呢！</p>
<p>白茅</p>
<h3>無家漢</h3>
<p>— 翼凡</p>
<p>老方是個古怪的人。在他的伙伴中，他是孤獨的；但在孩子的隊伍中，他却不失爲天眞活潑。</p>
<p>「是早就好討老婆的人了，還這末和孩子蘭在一塊，不怕嗎？」廚子阿發老是半頑笑半正經地打趣着他。</p>
<p>英看他人長得又長又大，却來得個心細敏感，也許這句話正觸動了他的愁懷。想想看：已是三十歲的人了，流浪了多年，却不過做了個學校裏的茶房，那當然只好孑然一身，討不起老婆了。他感到慚愧，他的面孔眞的紅了起來。</p>
<p>他愛不起女人，於是，他愛孩子。</p>
<p>傍晚，後門一開，他便出來尋孩子了；不，也可以說是孩子出來尋他。孩子和他結了不解之緣，他們喜歡他，聽他的話，迎着他叫「老朋友」。</p>
<p>「來，小朋友！我給你們吃糖。」老方手一揚，正有幾塊花生糖揑在手裏。</p>
<p>孩子們立刻搶過去了，圍着他的腿，嘴飛津津地嚼着他分的糖，抬頭有趣地看着他那張和善的臉</p>
<p>「老朋友，上回你不是帶小柳他們看紹興戲去的嗎？今晚再帶我們去好不好？」一個孩子勾着他的臂膀說。</p>
<p>「晤，——唔。」老方掏掏口袋，只好支吾着回答了。</p>
<p>但不到幾天，他便偸偷地帶子三四個孩子到黃金大戲院去。夜裏，孩子們回來子，，興緻極濃的說着：「老朋友眞好，他帶我們去，還是乘的那紅色汽車呢，眞是又快又舒服。看戲的時候，老朋友詳細的告訴我們，那個唱大喉嘀的叫什麼，那個揑尖了喉嚨的又叫什麼。後來出來了，我們一齋嚷餓，他就領我們到一家飯館裏去吃了羊肉麵才回來。」</p>
<p>誰都知道他是非常節儉的。本來，一個茶房能有什麼錢可賺呢？可是，他會毫不吝嗇的把積下來的血汗錢用給了孩子們，孩子們的父母都說他是好心人，時常叫他到他們家裏去玩，但他却有着和他底魁梧的身體不大相稱的癖性，是怕見生人，所以總不肯到人家走動。只有當人家生了孩子，罰滿月酒，或者做週歲，他才不好意思地送點人情，挨進門來極親熱地抱抱孩子，滴下歡喜的眼淚來。</p>
<p>一天，不知爲了什麽，他竟破例買了幾斤肉和老酒。他把肉要求九號裏的老太婆替他燒好了，便請我和另外一個隣居陪他去喝酒。</p>
<p>酒一入肚，他的話倒變多了。</p>
<p>「要是沒有孩子和我玩，我的生活是多麼的無味啊！」他苦笑着搖搖頭</p>
<p>「你這末喜歡孩子，難這却不喜歡女人麼？」老太婆插進了：「你想，有了女人也就會有孩子了，哈哈！」</p>
<p>「女人都是看不起我的，可是我心中也只有一個女人。那是個好姑娘：柔絲般的頭髮，黑紅的險，鈴似的笑聲，爽朗的性格。我愛上了她，忽然有一天，她被一個惡鬼强抓去汚辱了，她是個貞節的姑娘，她不願再活下去，她便跳了水。這樣，我便永遠失去了她。失去了她，我却忘不了她，我再也不想到別的女人了。」他急速且熱情地說着，面孔漲得血紅。</p>
<p>「雖是這末說，你年紀也這樣大了，回去討個本鄕的女人也是應該的呀。」我的隣人勸慰着他。</p>
<p>「回去？我回到那裏去？」</p>
<p>於是我問起他是那裏人來。</p>
<p>「這連我自已也不大知道。我只記得小時候，父親帶着我各處流浪，從南方到北方，又從北方到南方，但肚子還是混不飽。這飛地方，只有浙江金華，我們住得最長，勉强可以說是我的故鄕。那地方風景眞好：永裏有山，山裏有水，水綠山靑，是多末的可愛啊！但不幸是我的父親就在這裏死去了。回想起來，靑山錄水中，總點綴着我父親的紫色的血痕。我害怕，我悲痛，我不忍再到那末可愛的地方去，我更不忍看到我父親墳頭的長長的靑草！……」他底眼淚滴進了酒杯中，個却被他舉起來，連酒帶淚的喝下去了。</p>
<p>這不禁勾起我幾年前經過浙東的回憶：坐着簡陋的民船飄流在那綠得透明的溪面上，曾經忘掉流浪的苦痛，飽嘗那曲折秀偉的山景。水不關，所以稱爲溪流。而山呢，山就聳立在水中，形成奇突的削壁。但並不是挺然的一整塊，却也迂曲嶙峋，雄偉中含蘊着英秀。船在一段平原中滑過，一轉灣忽然就有一疊高峯飛在眼前，給人以驚心的嘆賞。……想起這美景，我也和他有了同情的感慨。</p>
<p>我們默默地喝了一會酒，看看肉已快吃盡了，他便立了起來，帶着徵啞的喉音說道：「我很想再請你們吃吃酒談談心。眞是，一個人過着實在太寂寞呢！……但是這機會恐怕是難有了。」</p>
<p>「一個人倒是自由的，你可以做你自己想做的事。」</p>
<p>他想了想，便點着頭高聲笑道：「是的，四海爲家，也許倒是像我這種人的一種樂趣呢。」</p>
<p>他試着要走了，忽然又回過頭來執着我的手低頭地說：「這裏我不願再登下去了。我總記得幾年前的一個朋友，說他要去尋找有意義的生活，呌我跟他一道去，我却終沒有答應。現在想想，眞很懊悔。……」</p>
<p>於是他掉轉身，邁步走了。</p>
<p>好多天沒有看見他。一天傍晚，小弟弟放學回來，便氣急地告訴我道：「老朋友回去了！」</p>
<p>「回到那裏去了？」</p>
<p>「有誰知道呢？」</p>
<p>我這才省悟到他那一次的燒肉請酒，原來是和我最後一次的告別。</p>
<p>燈下緬懷着他，不覺記起一從今四海爲家日，故轟蕭蕭蘆荻秋」兩句詩來。</p>
<p>在他底將來的流浪生活裏，盼望不會再有那一片秋了吧。</p>
<h3>伸訴</h3>
<p>— 方宣</p>
<p>這幾天心緒壞極了，命運爲什麽偏偏苛待我們善良的一羣，這是我頂懷疑的。想到自己的一些藉以爲生的東西，而硬被人霸佔了去，卽使是頂豁達的人，也是免不了憤怒的。但是有什麼法子呢，自己的東西己經被人家拿了去了，而這個東西又宣佈了一破產」·我記起他在警察署內司法科辦公室裏的得意洋洋的神色，似乎他不是在受法律的制裁，而是在受法律的保護了。</p>
<p>「如果要了，就是這個數目」！他堅決地說，大聲地吐了一口唾沫，這是很顯明的，他說出比市價少一半的數目來霸佔了人家的東西，再用這「贏餘」的數目來謀得法律以外的人情方面使用！</p>
<p>——這是有法律的世界麽？</p>
<p>我看到他所委請的律師切切地私欲，互敬着香烟，我禁不住嘆起氣來了。</p>
<p>但是——誰叫我們這樣窮呢？我們請不起律師跟他周旎！我們不得不退出了被害人的一羣，單獨地跟他「私了」了。他指定和他的妻子接洽，在一個下大雪的早晨，我們趕到他的家裏去了。</p>
<p>他的妻子還睡在床上，她打着呵欠，伸着懶腰，慢呑吞跳下床來。她拉開皮夾，拿出一只香烟匣子來，在背面寫着他丈夫的字跡，板着臉說：</p>
<p>「照這字樣寫一張收據，不要再三心二意，」</p>
<p>我顚抖着手拿起這張字條，這是什麽話，他要我承認把原物收回？——天呀，我拿到你的是你所侵佔的一半以下的價錢呀，你是强盜也該放些良心出來，爲什麽還要這我寫這麽一張收據？</p>
<p>這事情速他所委請的一位調解者，也覺得對方太辣手了。他躊躇地搓着手，倒穿了一口冷氣說：</p>
<p>「那麽你自己再擬一張收條，到捕房裏去見Ｘ先生，說妥了再寫吧！」</p>
<p>我點點頭，拉開門走了出來，在背後送來了這女人尖銳的聲音：</p>
<p>「你去見他吧，他不光火！——哼！」這句話使我像在脊椎上流下了冰水一樣的渾身顚抖着，難道這世界上只配凶惡的人開口，「道理」是在他們的嘴上麽！</p>
<p>等我再擬好了一張比較合理的收據，到警察署裏去看他，他把這張字條端詳了許久，在鼻子裏發出了笑聲來：</p>
<p>「那麼便宜了你吧！」</p>
<p>他從身邊摸出一本支票簿，簽了二張支票。我把支票拿到手，訥訥地問：</p>
<p>「Ｘ先生，這支票到期不會退的吧？」</p>
<p>「當然，我的支票怎麽會退，……你知道我在被扣押以外，還有一部份的財產！」</p>
<p>他正經地說，我禁不住爲自己的愚笨而失笑了。</p>
<p>是的，明後天，我當能拿到一筆不大不小的款子，我可以安穩地渡過這年關了，但是過了這年關，我該怎樣過日子呢？</p>
<p>做强盜是要犯法的，——所謂法律，對我們也許是一重威脅！</p>
<h3>苦葉</h3>
<p>— 城下</p>
<p>記得當年，初次算噙得愛情的苦葉，</p>
<p>曾怎樣度過那漫漫的長夜：</p>
<p>無聲的淚水洒落得遍枕，</p>
<p>再将反面哭濕到天明。</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>如今，却只有這難言的澀結，</p>
<p>遺落了嘆息，也想不起一句怨言</p>
<p>看遠燈，那一團暈黃漲大再縮小</p>
<p>眼，如枯井底泛一泛水光，又爲荒蕪吸乾。</p>
<p>只詫異往日的心怎那般柔潤？</p>
<p>至今却巳榨不出一滴漿汁；</p>
<p>金尾的愛情已涸成了死魚，</p>
<p>不再划躍，只翻起它灰白的肚皮</p>
<h3>鋼琴天才李慈德</h3>
<p>— 尤山虎</p>
<p>法朗士，李慈德（Ｆranz　Liszt）正巧比好萊場的大明星羅勃，泰勒（ＲobertＴaylor）早上一世紀。他從十五歲開始，到他七十五歲，壽終正寢爲止，無時無刻沒有女人環機他，獻媚他，誘惑他，吻他的手，想他的身，用自殺來威脅他，相互間傾軋撕打，展開了大衆情人的爭奪戰。</p>
<p>這種瘋狂醉迷的女人，剪下他的頭髮，藏記在心口胸前。她們都搶着喝他剩下來的咖啡。她們搜集他坐過的橙子椅子，因爲這已被他那不朽的臀部壓過。</p>
<p>李慈德歡喜這一套：他是好女色的。他父親亞當。李慈德原是個匃牙利某家的總管，他爲了要造就他的兒子，使他成爲人中之傑，寗可放棄自己的職業。他臨終的時候，還在病床上叮囑的他的兒子：女人會毀了他的。——當時，他才十六歲。</p>
<p>不到一年，法國工商實業部大臣深夜十二時後返家時，發覺他的女兒正和這位大人物躭在起居室里。這對年輕人說：他們授受音樂之際，已墜入了情網。做父親的打開門來，轟他出走。此後李慈德也就退出了社交生活，敎士般的隱居了二年。</p>
<p>結果，他搖身一變而爲歐洲最羅蔓蒂克的靑年，度着登革熱似的交際生活，週旋於巴黎的沙龍和私邸間，時或自卑自凟，時或自憐自尊。</p>
<p>他的第一件醜事，就是和愛歌脫女伯爵私奔。女伯爵名瑪麗，爲人聰明伶俐，妖媚可人，但有點吹毛求疵，綽號「二十呎火山岩液上的六呎雪。」</p>
<p>他倆在瑞士和意大利同居了四年，生了三個孩子。白蘭事，柯西瑪和據尼拉。</p>
<p>瑪麗爲了他底心上人，放棄了一切：金錢，名譽，地位，親族以及朋友。她儘心地使他好好地生活，安靜地工作；而在於他祗有三個月的限度。侮搬到一個新地方，他就漸次將客人請來，佔滿了他的屋子，和當地的第一流高尙人仕厮混得透熟。遊宴，郊獵，成爲他日常的功踝。但，他的太太瑪麗總是躭在家里。偶或他還要獨自溜到巴黎去，過了一二個月才返家。他推托要募捐慈善基金，他跑到維也納，從此一鳴驚人，成爲全世界歷來最聞名的「即興鋼琴家」（Ｐiano-virtuoso　不照樂譜，隨手彈奏的鋼琴獨奏家。）</p>
<p>李慈德在歐洲遊歷了十年，在各地演奏，到處受人歡迎，一般醉心藝術的學生和瘋狂欲絕的婦女更萬般諂媚奉承。獎章，禮物，請帖，……不斷地送給他；金錢水也似的流來，他也就水也似的化去。他擾亂了，轟動了每個首都！里斯本，聖彼得堡，倫敦，君士坦丁堡。</p>
<p>每星期，他寫一封寫給瑪麗，記述他的成功：「我在這城的頂端，尤其在一般貴族和婦女中。……王上和我很客氣……我是這里倫敦季的雄獅。」同時每星期也有妒忌他的朋友寫信給瑪麗，告發他最近的　跡淫聞：女戲子潑蘭兒，拜喬佐莎公主，莎茂洛夫人，歐洲最有名的妓女洛蒞蒙丹。</p>
<p>瑪麗苦守了六年，結果絕裙而去，說他：「是個暴發戶式的「唐璜」（歐洲大情人），是個大騙了！</p>
<p>李慈德到處演奏，展露他絕世的才。他那長長的頭髮，閃閃的雙眼，大大的鼻孔，愁愁的表情，成爲今世即興鋼琴家的典範。他侮天換一根新領帶，上合時穿起寬大的匈牙利式披肩，慢慢地脫下手上綠色的皮手套，拋到地上，然後才正式開始彈奏。</p>
<p>在俄國時，他乘搭一艘西班牙式的帆船旅行，船里有餐室臥室和廚房。在德國時，人民預先在各火車站上安置了一架鋼琴，待火車一到，就請他出來表演。</p>
<p>他對於顯貴並不會嫵媚，他曾經拒絕爲法王路易菲力普演奏，因爲他甚個　盜神器，篡奪王位的人，他拒絕過玻利維亞的魯特維一世，因爲他和名妓洛拉蒙丹有私；他拒絕過西班牙的伊薩蒞女王，因爲照地們的禮儀，他不能引見女王。</p>
<p>這並不是過份日傲，在那個時代，音樂家和　　一般看待，祇能在主人允許後方得入室演奏，飯食在廚房里受用的。所以經他這一來，音樂家才能抬頭，揚眉吐氣，爭得了社會上祟高的地位。</p>
<p>突然，他放棄了一切，擔任德國惠馬的音樂顧問，一年拿一千元薪俸。他不再爲金錢而演奏，他當樂隊指揮，他作曲，想建立永久的榮譽。</p>
<p>有好幾次，他差一點就和威特根絲登公主結婚，最後一次，什麽都準備齊整，公主忽然變卦。他獨自隱避，在吸雪茄，完成了二十五巨册的著作：「敎堂內部不振的外在原因」。</p>
<p>李慈德始終是個勾引良家婦女的上流淫棍，到七十五在火車里着凉而死於肺炎的時候，還有許多女人園繞於他的四周，搶着要看護他，照料他。氣得他女兒連他非喝不可的白蘭地也不肯給他喝了。</p>
<p>除了他爲粥粥羣雌所逐鹿的私生活以外，在音樂史上，他完成了十二章交響詩，「浮士德」和「但丁」。至於他憧憬的「未來派音樂」終於不克告成。這也是音樂家史册上的一代怪傑呢。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽甲甲組　華聯中北並峙局面　甲乙組中北乙東華有糾紛　女子組綠隊完全全勝記錄</h3>
<p>第三屆上海籃球聯賽，甲甲組甲乙組及女子組之戰程，均已完畢，本可告一段落。不料甲甲組因中北華聯之各勝一塲，冠軍難產，尙須在最有一次之決戰，但以塲地關係（西青已不復借用）究於何日何地舉行，俟理事會之決定。據理事長戴昌齡云：該兩隊曾在申報盃中並列冠軍，唯曾允申報當局，決爲助學金再比賽一次，此次當可利用機會，作一舉兩全之策，想必爲該兩隊所同意，亦所以踐前約也，則球迷可靜待佳音。茲追評甲甲紀第二循環華聯勝中北之一役，甲乙組中北乙東華糾紛之我見，及介貂女子冠軍錄隊之優點，爲籃球聯賽甲女組行將功德圓滿前之總檢討焉。</p>
<h3>評華聯勝　中北之役</h3>
<p>第一循環中北勝華聯，上週已加評述。其第二循環之再戰，於本週三（二月二十八日）下午五時半在西靑球房舉行。球迷因震於此南北宗匠之盛名，且以後樓會之難求，故　先光恐後，雖票價爲五百　·二千元之最高價，依　擁擠，塲無隙地，較第一塲多出一半，極一時之盛。懷是日天氣懊熱，益以人氣在熱，乃致球房之牆壁間，蒸水涓滴，塲地因而濘滑，此乃該賽唯之缺憾耳。</p>
<p>華聯此賽之　字　　生病，賽前莫不爲華聯危，以爲中北可再度奏旋。不意交手之後，華聯即見順手，而其所取之陣容，釘人之措置，實爲成功之要素。如易吳成章爲勃脫對煞陳學祟，乃鑒於前戰之漏洞而用適當人頭行其守衛之職，此不得不歸攻於張　祥之善用腦力也。致華聯進攻方法，最獲成功，蓋人釘人戰術，必須用擋人進襲，筆者在評述其第一戰一文中，早謂彼此所用擋人方法太少。此番華聯在進攻中，大多用此法進襲。張良雄勃脫之所以能獲分較多，皆賴　錫麟出主擋人工作，始克覓隙而入也。又此次裁判極爲嚴格，故華聯連罰出四人之多，以其人材濟濟，又有張領隊之調遣有方，故能始終應付到底，獲得勝利，誠値得稱賞。致評中北之所以敗，當爲守的方法，無阻遏對方擋入策略，而進攻時依然一貫老方法，爲華聯所認淸，於是未能順利得手。前是日塲地過滑，中北隊員較華聯爲高，易失重心，稍見吃虧。且北派作風，以弄花巧爲勝，乃以塲地關係，發揮較艱，未始非中北失敗之一附因也。最後更因罰出三人之後，沈聿恭又受傷不能應戰下，袛聰四將，終致回天乏衛。在四人作飛之時，李震中竭力主張多獲球，勿希望能反敗爲勝。固極有見解，乃大將之材，蓋在人釘人戰術，及實力平均之兩隊，以寡敵衆，萬無倖勝之理，則倒不如求失分少，使紀錄好看。總結果華聯以三十九對三十四，復一箭之仇，造成再戰之必要，球迷之眼福眞不淺。</p>
<h3>中北乙與　東華糾紛</h3>
<p>甲乙組中以中北乙東華兩軍爲最强，彼此均迭克强敵。當該兩隊相逢之夕，無異爲一塲決賽，演出極呈緊凑，東華始終領前之優勢下，不幸勳最後八分鐘，東華以三〇對二二領先時，幸栽判王基恩之判斷有誤，　事實爲中北乙王鏡湖帶球深入，東華鐔福楨猛阻，被判犯規。在笛聲鳴時，而球同時由中北乙沈遠手中　進籃　，是時王基恩判進球有效，　福楨犯規。當時東華隊長賈幼良即賣問裁判，　福楨犯規之對象爲王鏡湖，鄉中球者爲沈達，旣犯規於前，進球何能計算。唯王基恩意思，即使鉛，亦錯到底矣。卒至東華不願賡續比賢，當塲王即匆匆宣判東華東權。嗣後東華則據理向籃球聯合會理事會提出抗議，但迄未見當局公布。致使此甲乙組之錦標，亦成懸案。故鄙意極盼常局早日作正式公告，蓋各界對此事殷股關懷。微聞當局已準備　覆東華抗議不成立，則自具其充分之理由。唯鄙意可促中北乙允與東華作一塲友誼此賽，中北乙果勝，東華當平心靜氣。萬一中北乙失敗，東華獲勝，則東華雖不能探獲錦標，亦可洩一口氣也。此乃在人情方而之設施，未必爲當局及雙方所同意乎？</p>
<h3>綠隊巾幗　全勝戰績</h3>
<p>女組中緣隊十戰十勝，且每塲勝分，總　相差甚多，可見該隊之質實本領。錢旭滄謝益欽之善心孤詣，庶有此良佳之成結也。按錄隊自成立以來，不論圓門球，排球，籃球，從未有一次失敗，此一點，足以傲視滬上任何球隊。即回遡滬上球史，從無一隊有此收穫，茲對此巾幗冊主之優點，略加評述：</p>
<h3>前鋒銳利無匹後衛交換看人</h3>
<p>該隊前鋒大致爲中鋒嚴蔚畏右鋒黃明媛左鋒容飛儉，隊長李　芝反居於後備軍中，亦所以在旁與錢領隊觀察得失關鍵。此三鋒俱有準卻之射籃，嚴蔚雯賴身高，拿後方傳出之球，萬無一失。黃明媛竄射之外，復多利用跟進方法。容淑儉老將身手，穩健有加，其左手籃下一托，十拿九穩。况三人合作功夫，已趨知彼知已之地步，迅速而純熟，蓋巳至爐火純靑地步。談其後衛爲王維珍劉珍寳汪印蘭三將。夫女子守衛，大都用人釘人政策，唯在守方死釘攻方之下，總有空隙，或對方一用擋人方法，即可有機可業。錄隊三衛，即能在人釘人方術中，飛兼用交換看人，蓋基於上列情形，在地位上在對方用方法時，必須用交換看人，旣省力又可不露空原。故時見錄隊三衛，在默契中交換看人，敵鋒乃無法進攻。</p>
<p>最後，對此六位巾幗，頗覺各有其個人方面之缺點，加以指摘，此所以希望精益求精，非吹毛求班。即爲嚴蔚委浪擲太多，黃明媛時現不能鎭靜，容淑儉獲球後易犯走步毛病，王維珍多無謂犯規，劉珍寳速度不够，任印鬮不能認眞。此皆小節，但如能消滅或改善，自可更上一級，質之旭滄，以爲如何？</p>
<h3>華影女籃球隊員　吳眞雄小姐于歸速寫</h3>
<p>前華影體育會主幹吳文超令媛吳眞雄小姐，於日前（二日）于歸之喜，吳小姐也是華影女籃隊的台柱。</p>
<p>新郎據說也是一位運動員，結婚地點是假四姊妹咖啡館舉行。</p>
<p>因爲吳文超是體壇和影壇活躍的人物，所以兩界到的是很多，於是極度的熱鬧。</p>
<p>截獲儀式是簡單而隆重，司儀是影星黃河，聲音漂亮。</p>
<p>介紹人韓蘭根致詞，不脫滑稽本色。大致謂：鄙人是現成媒人，他們所以要請我的原因，因爲我是多子階級，乃新郎新娘亦冀多子多孫也。</p>
<p>來賓殷秀岑演說：胖子說新郎新娘最討厭演說的人話太多，所以我不便多說話，願明年此日，請我們吃紅蛋。他們的結品品，像我殷秀岑一樣的胖。</p>
<p>婚禮完畢，茶點一番。來賓乃要求四姊妹唱歌，在再三鼓掌聲衆，大姊襲秋霞終於走上音樂合，憑其美妙的喉嚨，唱新曲「是夢是眞」請脆抑揚，來賓莫不認爲滿意。在襲大姊歌音繞繞中，筆者因　先走，未能再聆陳琦張帆陳娟娟的喉音。</p>
<h3>籃球學理述要　（十三）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>旋轉之主要用處，在保持個人之護球權，與躱避對方防守。其方法可分兩種：（一）向前旋轉。此種用法，多在對方從後面跟踪前來搶球時行之。例如當對方在後方走近時，若其所在地，偏向右方，則提起右足，從前方向左或向後轉身。反之若其所在地，偏向左方，則用左定提起，向右前方轉向後面，以便逃脫。但此種轉法，尙須視停住後，兩足所立之位置，而定用何足旋轉，遇二足平衡同時觸地時，則可用任何一足提起。若二足前後分立，而又不同時觸地時，則祇可提起前足，後足則不能離開原位，否則即犯持球行走。（二）向後旋轉。此種用法，常在拍球前進，遇對方在前面　阻時用。當拍球停住後，所站位置，距離防守者，不及一碼以外時，爲避免觸及對方身體，犯侵人犯規起見，此時祗可用向後旋轉，以脫離敵人，即以背向對方，使其不易搶得球。此種轉法，當停住時，若兩足一齊落地，可用任何一足提起，從左或右方反身向後轉。若兩足前後分立，而又不同時觸地，則祇可提起前足，或後來着地之一足轉。旋轉方法，實不袛此兩種，不過其他方法，可由此二種運用變通。旋轉之主要目的，在使自己身體，常保持夾在敵人與本人取持之球當中，以避免對方槍奪。能適當運用各種旋轉技術者，必能當機應變，取巧以破敵人之防禦，或作出種種裝虛作勢，矇騙敵方以便攻其不備。</p>
<h3>體壇什錦</h3>
<p>足球聯賽甲組，定今日（四日）上午十時在跑罵廳，有東華儕聯之大戰，以昨日有雨，又將難產。但願今日天晴，或可比賽。</p>
<p>大華籃球隊，擬在其自備球塲上，舉辦一女子籃球聯賽。觀乎滬上女籃球隊之蓬勃，可望有熱鬧情形也。</p>
<p>前華南藍球隊台柱，現隸中北乙之劉福善，球藝進步甚速，陳學崇對福善，最爲賞識。（大可）</p>

Enemy forces have repeatedly attacked Japanese strongholds east of Manila. There has been fierce fighting in the vicinity of Tete and Antipolo. Since the 24th, enemy forces have repeatedly approached the Japanese army's positions in the area, but have been unsuccessful due to concentrated artillery fire from the Japanese side and the brave fighting of the infantry units.

<p>Weekly Review</p>
<h3>My Views on the Issue of Evacuating Schools</h3>
<p>— Dai Yingfu</p>
<p>I believe that the significance of evacuating schools is active, and it should not be regarded as purely passive and cowardly behavior of seeking refuge. Of course, in order to protect the younger generation and preserve some of the vitality of the nation, it is necessary to avoid becoming victims of enemy air raids as much as possible. But I believe that in addition to this, there are more active educational reasons.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not the best place to study in the ideal sense. Educators have this view. However, there are especially many schools in Shanghai. Due to the sins of the past concessions and the dominance of commercial capital, education in Shanghai has been subjected to various temptations and influences. Inevitably, a part of it has been distorted. This is undeniable. Therefore, we should seek the reform of Shanghai education while actively maintaining it. It is not only for one place, but we should start from the big picture, the small picture, and the nearby picture, because the success or failure of Shanghai education is enough to affect the future of the entire education system.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue of evacuating schools should be regarded as a kind of reform in Shanghai education, and the emphasis should be placed on its active significance.</p>
<p>If we plan to go to a suitable evacuation location and create a new educational environment, we can truly run the ideal education – an education that is suitable for the Chinese tradition. Here, there are bamboo fences and thatched houses that can be our classrooms and dormitories. There are fields and land that can be used for farming and self-sufficiency. Small industries can be established to manufacture daily necessities. Hospitals can be established to ensure hygiene and the treatment of diseases. There are many expert professors and many excellent young people who study agriculture, engineering, or medicine. They study, practice, labor, and produce at the same time, living a common life, shouldering a common mission, and cultivating Chinese youth who can truly shoulder the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia. Of course, the following points must be accomplished first:</p>
<p>(1) Teachers and students must have this understanding and determination;</p>
<p>(2) The immediate family members of teachers should evacuate with them;</p>
<p>(3) The government should allocate a large amount of funds to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Based on the above opinions, we should first evacuate colleges of science and engineering, medical colleges, and agricultural colleges. National universities that belong to this category should be evacuated first. For private colleges and universities, we should first establish a joint university at the evacuation location, and have a part of the staff and students go there, and move all important equipment there. The Shanghai main campus should be temporarily maintained, and if necessary, it should be moved completely. Liberal arts colleges, business colleges, senior high schools in ordinary middle schools, teacher training schools, and senior vocational schools should also be prepared in advance and evacuated gradually. As for the measures for primary and secondary school students to evacuate with their families and return to their hometowns, I have already mentioned this to the reporter of the Pingbao News Agency, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>In this new educational environment, all educational facilities can be rebuilt, and the shortcomings of the past will naturally be eliminated. Destruction is construction. I can assert that new educational achievements will be obtained in the evacuation of schools.</p>
<p>Capital Communications</p>
<h3>New Year Vignettes in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Renping</p>
<p>In the capital, the annual Spring Festival is extraordinarily decorated with an atmosphere of peace and prosperity, as if the smell of gunpowder has been completely forgotten.</p>
<p>Qinhuai Lantern Market</p>
<p>The crowds on the banks of the Qinhuai River become more crowded day by day as the Spring Festival approaches. This liveliness is even greater than in previous years. Who says that wartime material resources are difficult and life is expensive? They are still spending and still enjoying themselves. Colorful lanterns, as in previous years, are towering into the clouds, lined up neatly in front of the Confucian Temple, hanging in strings and competing for beauty! In this era of rising prices, lanterns have also risen in price in general, calling for hundreds to thousands of yuan per lantern, but they can still find their patrons. The Chinese are the most fond of liveliness, especially on the banks of the Qinhuai River, a land of Six Dynasties smoke and water.</p>
<p>Bits and Pieces of the Festive Scene</p>
<p>The area around the Confucius Temple is the center of the capital's popular revelry. There are cinemas, Peking opera houses, and spoken drama. What is special is that the Qing singing (a form of Chinese folk song performance) can be said to be full of seats day and night during these few days. Among them, the cinemas are of course the best in business, because they are cheap and good. What is different here from other places is the special preferential treatment for soldiers. They can buy a soldier's ticket for only one-fifth of the price for ordinary people, but there are no people entering the venue without buying a ticket.</p>
<p>In addition to normal entertainment, there is of course the same improper entertainment, which should actually be ordinary entertainment, but taking advantage of the opportunity of the Spring Festival, every family, big and small, is filled with the sound of gambling. Although there is no large-scale gambling, it is still breathless. The daily necessities of life, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, are so expensive. The minimum monthly expenditure for a low-level family is tens of thousands of yuan. Even a rickshaw puller has to earn two thousand yuan a day to make a living. Of course, the life of civil servants, although their salaries have been raised again and again, is still among the lowest-level consumers.</p>
<p>In order to take into account the people's livelihood and improve the people's livelihood, the authorities have formed a "Capital Commodity Price Stabilization Committee," but the scene of winning or losing millions, which is not less than that, exists in this bright city in a distorted way, and is at ease outside the authorities' strict ban on gambling.</p>
<p>Speaking of Prices</p>
<p>Although it is not uncommon to throw away 100,000 yuan today, it is still limited to special classes. The life of ordinary people is still threatened by commodity prices. The strict management of commodity prices and the implementation of price limits on eight daily necessities, such as firewood and rice, are especially effective and have achieved considerable results by the end of the lunar year. The extortion of military police at various city gates and station docks has also been thoroughly eliminated. The violators are punished with the death penalty, and there have been two cases of shooting in Yuhuatai. Because starting in February, the authorities have allocated special funds to all military police in the city, and each person's immediate family member is given a living allowance of 10,000 yuan for every two people. The subsidy will also be increased if there are more people in the family, and it will be increased at any time if commodity prices rise in the future.</p>
<p>The implementation of this method has given the citizens of the capital great expectations, but with various industries in a semi-rest state during the New Year, price fluctuations seem to be secretly active again. Although the authorities have announced that the price of rice should not exceed 20,000 yuan, the capital, which has always been full of black market rice, has also disappeared. At the same time, the price of cooking oil has soared from more than 400 yuan a scoop to more than 800 yuan a catty, which is said to be due to insufficient supply. The high price of vegetables is also frightening, often costing hundreds of yuan a catty, and firewood is also not easy to buy.</p>
<p>Recently, because the gold shops opened on the first day of the market, gold was listed at 300,000 yuan per tael, so various industries have taken the opportunity to raise prices. The number of stores with big sales in the city is no less than a thousand, but in the end it is just a facade.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the people's livelihood has been listed as one of the important policies of the authorities and has the greatest determination, and the capital is a touchstone, and the people are waiting to see!</p>

<h3>Ministry of Health Adjusts Air Raid Relief Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Due to recent frequent enemy air raids in various locations, causing casualties among innocent civilians, the Ministry of Health is concerned about the preparedness for air raid relief in different areas and the adequacy of medical supplies, as these are directly related to the lives of the people. To understand the air raid relief situation in various provinces and cities and the necessary medical supplies for air raid relief, in order to facilitate overall planning and distribution, a special Air Raid Relief Survey Form has been created. This form has been sent to various provincial and municipal governments, requesting them to provide detailed information on the deployment of air raid relief personnel, the number of personnel, the equipment of relief locations, the practice of air raid relief work, the regular storage and quantity of relief medicines and materials, and the preparation and quantity of relief equipment.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Enthusiastically Donates Airplanes</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The airplane donation campaign involving 800,000 Chinese and Japanese residents of Tianjin is becoming increasingly enthusiastic with the progress of the war. Since the initial donation of four million yuan by 7,000 Japanese residents, various sectors of the city have responded enthusiastically. Subsequent donations include 2.3 million yuan from the Tianjin branch of the North China Fiber Association, 1.87 million yuan from Tianjin citizens, 1 million yuan from rice companies, 800,000 yuan from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, and 400,000 yuan from the Tianjin Alkali Joint Sales Co., Ltd. By the end of February, the total number of donated airplanes had reached 738.</p>
<h3>US Production Board Official Talks About Japan's Strong Potential</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch, Mr. Batt, Director of Raw Materials and Resources of the US War Production Board, stated in a speech on the 1st regarding the future of the US-Japan war that although the US has massive production capabilities, the future of the war against Japan is still very difficult. There are three reasons for this: First, the existing Japanese army is comparable to the German army during its peak period. Second, a new and sharp army is stationed in North Manchuria. Third, the Japanese army still possesses considerable potential.</p>
<h3>France and Italy Restore Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: According to news from Paris, France and Italy have restored diplomatic relations, and an agreement has been signed. Count Sforza has been appointed as the first Italian ambassador to France.</p>
<h3>Center of Eastern Front Battles Still on Northern Flank</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: The focus of the Eastern Front battles remains in Pomerania and East/West Prussia within the past 24 hours. Enemy forces attacking various strongholds are constantly receiving reinforcements of infantry and tanks. The major battle in East Prussia continues fiercely, but the focus has shifted from the vicinity of Grudzborg to the southwest of the Neistan-Mörsach line, with the aim of advancing towards the highway connecting Königsberg to Elbing. The Soviet attempt to sweep through the German front line along the Vistula River from Tucheler Heide in West Prussia has failed. The main Soviet pressure is now in East Pomerania, with vanguard troops advancing north to the Schlawe-Köslin highway, ten kilometers south of the coast. The situation is unchanged on the line from Schwetz to Lauban, with Lauban now serving as an important pillar at the southern corner of the front.</p>
<h3>German Official Comments on Roosevelt's Declaration: Determined to Fight for Survival</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the main purpose of Roosevelt's declaration is to make the American people believe in the decisions of the Yalta Conference, but the results of this meeting have not yet been determined. Germany will resolutely fight to the end against the American plan. If the anti-Axis powers remove Germany's machinery and vehicles, the German people will have no way to survive. Therefore, implementing Roosevelt's plan is tantamount to starving the German people to death.</p>
<h3>Turkey Still Under Threat from Germany</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Turkish Embassy in Chongqing announced on the 21st that if the anti-Axis powers attempt to shorten transportation lines, the Turkish government can send troops to East Asia. The power of the German army in the Balkan Peninsula still directly threatens Turkey's security. Therefore, the significance of this declaration of war is more profound for Germany than for Japan.</p>
<h3>US Lieutenant General Harmon Killed in Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News, New York: Lieutenant General Harmon, commander of the Strategic Air Force in the Pacific, was killed in a plane crash in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces on Western Front Cross Erft River; Fierce Battle for Trier</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: The major battle surrounding the Rhineland-Westphalia industrial area is intensifying. The main actions of the Allied forces in the past 24 hours are as follows: (1) The Canadian 1st Army continued its slow offensive between Kleve and Xanten. (2) Strong tank units of the US 9th Army advanced towards the Neuss area. (3) The British 2nd Army attacked German defenses in the Venlo area in southeastern Netherlands. From this, it can be seen that Montgomery not only wants to occupy territory but also wants to carry out large-scale encirclement operations. The Canadian army is now advancing southeast, seemingly aiming to progress towards Xanten and Rees, while the American army is advancing north towards Neuss-Düttingen, with the clear intention of cutting off the rear transportation of the German forces still fighting in the Meuse area. The US 1st Army advanced towards Cologne, which is more linear than the 9th Army's advance towards Düsseldorf. Although the anti-Axis forces were able to cross the Erft River on the Düren-Cologne highway, they were stopped in front of the new German positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News: The enemy's attack on the historically significant city of Trier has begun. About 100 tanks of the US 3rd Army departed from the Saarlouis bridgehead and advanced to the eastern suburbs of Trier. A tank battle has now commenced.</p>
<h3>Train and Ship Tickets Revised with New Prices; Telegraph and Telephone Fees Redetermined</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Central China Railway Company has increased its ticket prices because the allocated price of coal has risen to 15,000 yuan per ton, which has greatly increased costs. In order to maintain the current operating status, the company has been approved by the Ministry of Construction to increase fares. Passenger tickets will increase by 166% of the current price, and freight will increase by 200%, effective from the 5th.

<h3>Money Shop Representatives' Meeting Decides to Strengthen Treasury Operations; Report on Many Important Cases Discussed at Last Year's Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Shop Guild held a memorial service for past directors at the Beishi Hall yesterday (3rd) at 2:00 PM, followed by the first meeting of the 12th Membership Representative Congress. Attendees included Pei Yunqing, Chairman of the Guild; Xu Wenqing and Shen Jingliang, Standing Directors and Supervisors; Cao Boquan, Secretary-General of the Guild; Shen Yanzhang, General Manager of the Treasury; and representatives from 224 shops, including Fuyuan, Tongrun, and Kang. Pei Yunqing, Wang Huailian, and Lu Shuchen served as the presidium. After formal greetings, Chairman Pei Yunqing delivered an opening speech, and Wang Huailian and Lu Shuchen reported on the Guild's work in the second half of last year. Shen Binzhang reported on the 25th period's financial report of the Treasury. The following items were then discussed: (1) Amendment to Article 33 of the Guild's Constitution, which was passed. (2) Regarding the matter of stopping payment for lost checks, it was proposed to add supplementary regulations to Article 46, stipulating that if there are losses, the amount of the check should be deposited with the Guild's reserve fund. (3), (4), (5), and (6) were omitted. (7) Regarding the proposal to establish a senior commercial course in the Qianye Primary and Secondary School and to request all member money shops to bear the expenses, it was decided that each shop would contribute 10,000 yuan, with even better contributions from those who donate more. (8) Regarding the proposal to convert the cash deposited in the treasury fund into substitutes for payment by member shops, or to collectively purchase assets with the already deposited funds to solidify the foundation, Lu Shuchen first explained that each shop previously extended 300,000 yuan and paid 100,000 yuan into the treasury fund. It has now increased to 3,000,000 yuan per shop, while the fund remains at 100,000 yuan. It seems appropriate to increase it to balance rights and obligations. Subsequently, it was decided that the fund deposited by each shop would be changed to 500,000 yuan and can be paid with substitutes. (9) and (10) were deleted. (11) Establishing a practical research committee for the money shop industry was approved.

There was considerable discussion on adding handling fees to returned check vouchers and the treasury regulations.</p>
<h3>Future Construction Work Will Focus on Road Construction; Director Xu Reports at Routine Press Conference</h3>
<p>The sixth routine press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held in the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Director Xu Jitun of the Construction Bureau immediately answered the questions raised by the newspapers in detail. The record of Mr. Xu's remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Municipal Construction Bureau</p>
<p>After I was appointed as the Director of the Construction Bureau, I followed the Mayor's instructions to implement the principle of administrative simplification. The internal adjustment of the bureau is largely completed, and the affiliated agencies are expected to be taken over and adjusted within a few days. Regarding the merger of the two bureaus and the establishment of the Construction Bureau, after receiving the order, I immediately evaluated the past work of the two bureaus. In the past, the Public Works Bureau focused on the management of water, electricity, and transportation, while the Engineering Bureau focused on the technical work of road administration and construction. There was some overlap in the work of both bureaus, but they also had their unique characteristics. Therefore, the establishment of the Construction Bureau's departments was carefully considered, and a total of six departments were established to maximize their original work efficiency. In accordance with the principle of simplification of the Municipal Government, the employees of the two bureaus were reduced by one-third to make the best use of their talents. Although one-third of the staff were laid off this time, the bureau's work is still proceeding as usual, with the aim of achieving maximum work efficiency with the least amount of manpower. As for the laid-off employees, in accordance with the Municipal Government's regulations, in addition to paying their March salaries as usual, they were also given three months' worth of salary for January to facilitate their departure. This is the process of establishing the Construction Bureau. In the future, the work of the Construction Bureau, in addition to carrying out the original work of the two bureaus, will also focus on road construction projects to assist in the preparation for population dispersal. This work will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>The Problem of Rickshaw Pullers Raising Prices</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of rickshaw pullers not complying with the official prices and arbitrarily raising prices, which is currently a concern for the general public, the bureau is also paying close attention. When the bureau approved the Rickshaw Guild's price increase, the representatives of the guild were instructed to operate in accordance with the official prices. According to numerous reports from citizens, rickshaw pullers are raising prices without authorization, which is an illegal act. In addition to ordering the guild authorities to strictly order their members to comply with the legal prices, the bureau also hopes that citizens will cooperate with the bureau and report any incidents at any time so that action can be taken. At the same time, in order to facilitate citizens' reporting, we are planning to set up mailboxes on important street corners so that citizens can report the rickshaw number to the bureau after being extorted by the rickshaw puller for thorough investigation. In addition, in order to unify and process the stoves and public buildings in the city, the bureau has sent personnel to investigate, hoping that citizens will cooperate to ensure the rationality and safety of various facilities.</p>
<h3>Changes in Leadership at the Oil and Grain Committee</h3>
<p>Chen Ziyi, the Chairman of the Oil and Grain Control Committee, has requested a three-month leave of absence due to illness. The Executive Yuan believes that oil and grain control is important and should not be left without someone in charge, so it has temporarily appointed Yang Heqing, the Vice-Chairman of the committee, to act as chairman. Ling Yangwu, a standing member of the committee, had previously requested a leave of absence due to illness and recently resumed his duties. In addition, Pan Jingxian, the Chief Secretary, has also resigned due to illness, which has reportedly been approved.</p>
<h3>Shipping Lines Resumed Operations Yesterday; Coal Problem Resolved</h3>
<p>Shipping in the city has been temporarily suspended since mid-February due to coal shortages, which has not only affected the source of supplies but has also directly impacted the people's food supply. After repeated discussions between the shipping industry and the relevant authorities, the coal problem for shipping has been resolved. As a result, shipping lines have resumed operations since the 3rd. The schedules of the various shipping lines are listed below: (1) North Jiangsu Line: The Chaji Wheel goes directly to Ruwei, Kou'an, and Tianxing Bridge; the Hana Wheel goes directly to Tianshenggang; and the Zhejiang Maru goes directly to Chongming. (2) Suzhou-Kunshan Inland River Line: The Fuxing Wheel goes directly to Kunshan, and the Dashan Maru goes directly to Suzhou and Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Strictly Enforces Price Controls; Butchers Raising Pork Prices Punished by Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau believes that rising prices have a significant impact on people's livelihoods, so it has followed emergency price control measures to assess new price limits for sixteen major commodities. Among them, five are subject to the control system and must be assessed separately with the relevant control committees, while the remaining eleven price limits have been assessed and announced for implementation by the Price Evaluation Council. It is learned that some butchers in the city have raised the price of pork, exceeding the limit of 100 yuan per catty, with the highest price reaching 1,800 yuan. Director Xu was furious upon hearing this and immediately sent personnel to investigate. More than 20 butchers who exceeded the price limit have been handed over to the Police Bureau for punishment, and investigators continue to be sent out to secretly investigate. Strict punishment will be given to any industry found to be violating price limits.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Strengthens Technical Office</h3>

<h3>Social Welfare Bureau Mediates Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Recently, due to various reasons, many factories and shops have closed or downsized, leading to labor disputes. Zhou, the Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, made the following remarks: (1) Factories and shops that close or downsize due to various difficulties must take into account the livelihood of the laid-off or terminated employees. After communicating with the employees, the employer should provide severance pay. The standard should be three months' salary (including food and accommodation expenses). With the severance pay subsidy, unemployed employees can find a way to return to their hometowns and will not be stranded in Shanghai. It is hoped that all closed factories and shops can automatically follow this standard to find a solution. (2) As for factories and shops in difficult circumstances, the severance pay standard should be lowered, or for employees who have a history of labor achievements in the service factory, a request for additional retirement pay should also be negotiated by both parties sincerely. When a resolution cannot be reached, a request should be made to the Bureau for mediation. However, employees must maintain order and must not take any disruptive action.</p>

<h3>New Association Shanghai Branch Held Yesterday: Divine Eagle Song Concert - Magnificent Singing Moved Listeners</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, in order to promote the great achievements of the Allied Japanese air combat soldiers, specifically publicly solicited Divine Eagle praise lyrics, and commissioned famous artists to compose music for the top three winning works. The branch also, in order to allow the public to hear the Divine Eagle praise songs and promote the "Kamikaze Spirit," held a Divine Eagle praise song concert yesterday (3rd) at 5 p.m. at the Waibaidu Bridge (Bund) Cathay Hotel. Attendees included the chairman of the branch, Chen Binhe, executive director Chen Riping, directors Lu Feng, Zhu Yongkang, and others from Chinese and Japanese circles, including Minister Matsudaira of the embassy's information department, Minister Matsushima of the fleet's press department, Captain Matsumoto, Captain Hirata, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Lin Junfu, Sakazume, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, and over 2,000 others. Chen Binhe first gave a report, followed by a speech by Minister Matsushima. After the speech, the performance began. The first part included Chinese and Japanese songs and the Divine Eagle praise song. The Chinese and Japanese songs were conducted by Hattori Ryoichi, and the Divine Eagle praise song was conducted by Chen Gexin. The singing was magnificent, and the listeners were moved. Then, a film of the war was shown, and the meeting adjourned. The texts of the speeches and the original lyrics of the Divine Eagle praise song are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman Chen's Speech: "Since the enemy America's encroachment in the Pacific last winter, the Allied land, sea, and air forces have organized Divine Wind special attack teams with the principle of 'one person, one plane, one ship,' continuously establishing immortal achievements in Taiwan and the Philippines. This is the general model of the spirit of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, called the 'Kamikaze Spirit.' The birth of the Kamikaze team dates back 670 years when Yuan soldiers attacked Japan from Mongolia. Suddenly, a gale arose, blowing the Yuan Dynasty's ships into the sea. Of the 100,000 Yuan soldiers, only three survived. At that time, Japan called it 'Kamikaze' (Divine Wind). A spirit, especially the Kamikaze Spirit, cannot be cultivated and achieved temporarily, nor can it be expressed casually. The Allied powers launched the Greater East Asia War with long-term preparations in this regard. The Kamikaze Spirit shown in this Greater East Asia War is the Kamikaze special attack team. After their departure, they did not want to return alive, bravely attacking and reducing enemy ships, promoting their Divine Wind, and using a small number of troops to defeat a large number of troops, achieving final victory. This association, considering that this Kamikaze Spirit needs to be publicized and promoted, and needs to be promoted in various wartime work in the rear, the former Shanghai News Federation specifically publicly solicited 'Divine Eagle praise lyrics' in December last year. The number of applicants was very enthusiastic. Finally, Li Hanying, Xie Junwei, and Zhou Aijiang were selected and awarded bonuses. The lyrics were published in various newspapers on January 9. Then, we humbly invited Mr. Chen Gexin and Yan Jie to compose the music. After today's performance, it will be widely spread among the people, hoping that the Kamikaze Spirit can be demonstrated in various wartime work in the rear of China."</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima's Speech:</p>
<p>"Today, the News Association is hosting the Divine Eagle praise song concert. I am very grateful to everyone for taking the time to participate. I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers and all participants.</p>
<p>Loyal and Brave Martyrs</p>
<p>On October 25th of last year, during the continuation of the battle in the Philippines, when naval and air operations were becoming increasingly fierce, our naval and land special attack teams successively appeared in the Leyte Island area, descending from the sky with demon-subduing swords, causing the enemy to be fearful and achieving the effect of 'must hit, must kill,' which I believe all of you are already aware of. As the war situation has developed recently, after the enemy landed on Luzon Island in early January this year, the decisive battle has become even more intense. From that time until the end of January, the special attack teams achieved the single achievement of sinking 82 enemy warships, aircraft carriers, and other ships, and destroying 75 of them. Such a major blow to the enemy was entirely due to the land and sea special attack teams using their bodies and planes to collide with enemy ships. The loyal and heroic spirit of Japanese soldiers sacrificing themselves for their country is truly unparalleled in ancient and modern times. This is the patriotic spirit of 'sacrificing oneself for righteousness,' as Confucius said. Of course, this is nothing more than the national character shown by the people of China and Japan in the construction of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Favorable Situation</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy has relied solely on material quantity and is eager to end the war, repeatedly engaging in reckless and bloody operations, but this is exactly what Japan's guiding tactics are aiming for. From a macro perspective, Japan is temporarily enduring tactical disadvantages and gradually gaining strategic advantages, completing preparations for the final victory. In the Luzon Island area, the enemy has spent nearly two months since January 9th. They have suffered unprecedented bloodshed. Although they have poured in 18 divisions, the progress of the battle is still not easy. As a result, they landed on Iwo Jima on February 19th. However, they also encountered fierce resistance from us in that area, and once again encountered a major bloodshed that had never occurred since the beginning of the Pacific War. As of today, the landing force is approximately 45,000, and it is estimated that at least one-third have been killed or wounded. According to enemy sources, they are losing two men every minute, just as the enemy Marine Corps commander said, "the most brutal battle in the 168-year history since the founding of the Marine Corps." We have observed the course of the Battle of Manila in the same situation. The enemy seems to be gradually approaching our inner circle, but the result is inevitably a large amount of bloodshed, which has greatly hindered the supply of human resources. This can also be understood from U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson's statement. The enemy is approaching our Japanese mainland step by step. From Japan's perspective, this is a planned strategy, and it will enter the stage of destroying the enemy. During this period, Japan will adopt a completely different strategic thinking from the past, enriching the best equipment and combat power, and we firmly believe that we will be able to reduce the enemy in the final stage.</p>
<p>Special Attack Spirit</p>
<p>Today, the people of Japan are thoroughly developing the special attack spirit and striving for the victory of the war. Moreover, the special attack spirit is expanding to all aspects such as politics, economy, and thought, whether on the front line or in the rear, and is gradually transforming into invincible combat power. The News Association has completed the Divine Eagle praise song composition and scheduled its first performance today. This has profound significance for China and Japan to fight together, and I am confident that it will have a great effect. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in this effort."</p>
<h3>Divine Eagle Praise Song</h3>
<p>— Lyrics by Li Hanying, Music by Chen Gexin, Yan Jie</p>
<p>(1) The Divine Wind soars, our might is displayed, invincible in the Pacific;</p>
<p>The American bandits attack from the east, their fighting power is strong, adding glory to the southern sky, the light of the yellow race.</p>
<p>(2) The Divine Eagle spreads its wings, every attack hits the mark, crushing the old and decaying, the war blood is red,</p>
<p>Working together with one heart, sea, land, and air, the brave soldiers are all heroes.</p>
<p>(3) Loyal, righteous, and brave, regardless of their own lives, their spirit swallows mountains and rivers, making ghosts and gods weep,</p>
<p>The enemy generals lose their courage, the enemy's heart is frightened, enemy planes are destroyed, enemy ships are leveled.</p>
<p>(4) Only our friendly nation has a decisive and heroic spirit, destroying Britain and America, establishing East Asia,</p>
<p>Sharing both joy and sorrow, and sharing victory, Divine Wind Divine Wind, the greatest achievement.</p>

<h3>The Defection of Colonies and the Relationship Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>A Seasoned Debtor</p>
<p>With trade, shipping, and overseas investment having no means of revival, all that remains in Britain's hands is the experience of having led international politics and economics for many years, and the façade that accompanies it. To compensate for its lack of real strength with cunning power plays can be said to be the particularly adept and signature skill of hypocritical Britain.</p>
<p>In a famous speech given in London in December 1943, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, after acknowledging the fact that Britain's national strength had significantly declined compared to the United States and the Soviet Union, proposed a countermeasure: to bring together the countries of Western Europe under its umbrella. To reorganize the so-called Sterling Area from these Western European countries and British self-governing colonies, and to use its strength to compete with the United States and the Soviet Union, is thought to be the basic tone of Britain's future policy.</p>
<p>Britain's policy of clinging to the Sterling Area can also be clearly seen in the words of Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson's response to a Member of Parliament's question in the House of Commons on October 9, 1944. In addition to implying that the post-war international currency plan of the Bretton Woods Conference was an idealistic plan lacking feasibility, Chancellor Anderson also said:</p>
<p>"There is a clear distinction between the necessary measures for the issue of external debts arising from the war and various issues in the post-war transition period, and the stability of international institutions that Britain and other countries are pursuing as their ultimate goal. The handling of British pound funds currently held by various countries in London falls within the former category."</p>
<p>Let us look at the arguments of the "Financial News":</p>
<p>"Regarding the British pound funds locked in London by various countries, legally speaking, they should be disposed of through normal international financial transactions in the future. However, if this argument is accepted, then Britain, in this war, in addition to losing most of its foreign investment, will also have to bear an external debt of 2 billion pounds, which is more than double the debt of the First World War... Of course, debts to neutral countries will certainly be recognized and repaid by normal methods. However, for other countries, the disposal of locked British pound funds should be carried out in a different way than for neutral countries... Because Britain's war debt is not only for Britain itself, but also for the necessary war waged for all other anti-Axis countries or the United States and its territories."</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the money borrowed from you was spent for your benefit, so it is inconvenient to treat it as an ordinary loan. Isn't Britain's attitude even more callous than that of a habitual debtor? The British government's publication of the "Bankruptcy White Paper" is precisely for this reason.</p>
<p>Wishful Thinking</p>
<p>What best reflects the inside story is the issue of the handling of Indian funds in Britain, which was heavily discussed at the recent Bretton Woods anti-war currency conference. It is said that the British pound funds held by India have reached 720 million pounds, which accounts for more than half of all the locked funds held by Britain. This is the price of food and military supplies taken by Britain by issuing dud checks, which they used during the last Great War by promising dominion status after the war and through armed repression, which left the Indian people mired in starvation and poverty. Moreover, Britain simply did not supply India with goods during this period, with the result that the depletion of Indian resources has become terribly frightening. Therefore, it is only natural that India should freely dispose of British pound funds and exchange them for US dollars or gold to seek the restoration of its national wealth.</p>
<p>"In response, the British side said that the spot goods of consumer goods in India have indeed been greatly reduced; this is a global phenomenon, not unique to India. The food famine last year caused difficult situations, but this was the result of the general public hiding food and the incompetence of local authorities, and not caused by excessive purchases by Britain."</p>
<p>While Britain is shouting like this, it is creating various pretexts, such as: the current exchange rate of the British pound to the rupee has nothing to do with India's high prices; Britain's burden on India's defense costs has increased, so the 1939 agreement must be revised, etc.; thereby trying to prevent India's British pound funds from being disposed of outside the Sterling Area. And Britain's real intention is to eliminate the aforementioned British pound funds by means of exchange rate manipulation in the future, in order to sell the goods it squeezed from the Indian people at a high price for only a small price. "Financial News" once frankly described it as follows:</p>
<p>"The use of these British pound funds can only be used as funds for purchasing goods from Britain, or transferred to within the Sterling Area. If there is still a surplus of British pound funds held by various countries in this way, they will be listed as non-interest-bearing claims against Britain and kept in deposit, and only allowed to be appropriated when various countries are short of foreign payment methods."</p>
<p>This is truly a completely wishful thinking! However, the United States aside, among the neutral countries and self-governing colonies, Britain only provides gold-like guarantees for debts to Argentina, so this issue will arise to some extent for the countries of the Sterling Area. Only the strength of the counterpart country will affect the degree of Britain's attitude.</p>
<p>Many Relatives Dissenting</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the various self-governing colonies of the British Empire are gradually turning away from their home country. Britain's attitude towards Indian British pound funds, etc., is also a kind of struggle that Britain is making under helpless circumstances, knowing the existence of this trend. However, India no longer believes in the old empty check of dominion status after the war, and earnestly demands practical things.</p>
<p>"During the previous Great War, India gave Britain a donation of 100 million pounds from 1917 onwards... and gave a huge donation when peace came. But in this war, because there is a very fierce anti-British political struggle within India, there is no sign of a second donation."</p>
<p>India is becoming more uncooperative with Britain, and there is another reason today, which is that the power of the United States has begun to permeate India. There is no doubt that the United States covets the Indian market, and the reason why it has repeatedly criticized Britain's India policy is because it has this intention. Although the United States and Britain are birds of a feather, India is happy to approach the United States when it begins to approach India, because India also wants to take advantage of the opposition between the United States and Britain. This makes Britain very nervous, so like the recent Phillips incident, it jumps up in anger when an American interferes in the governance of India.</p>
<p>Next, what about Canada? Due to the war, this country's political and economic dependence on the United States has also been increasing. Recently, rather than being a member of the British Empire, it sees itself as a bridge between Britain and the United States. At the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in May 1944, Canadian Prime Minister King said: "Canada is the link between the New World and the Old World. Canada is connected to the mother country by sacred bonds, and connected to the United States by deep friendly relations." Australia and New Zealand today not only depend on the United States militarily and economically, but also have not forgotten the fact that Britain did not provide any assistance when the two countries were on the verge of an unprecedented crisis in the early stages of the Greater East Asia War. South Africa is somewhat more friendly to Britain, but it also advocates restoring the gold standard together with India, and thus opposes Britain on currency policy. As a result, large-scale British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences, etc., although they contain a sense of friendly posture, have no concrete results, and the view of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams is unavoidable. On the contrary to what Britain hopes, the ties of the British Empire will become looser in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Western European Group plan, which has been widely discussed recently, although it is hoped for by Britain, has been opposed by the Soviet Union and the United States. Especially the Soviet Union, which regards this as an anti-Soviet move and severely criticizes it. Judging from the fact that France and other countries are taking advantage of this situation to launch a "using barbarians to control barbarians" diplomacy, it can be seen that the countries of Western Europe are not necessarily more pro-British than the self-governing colonies of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Digging One's Own Grave</p>
<p>Britain, which is facing domestic problems of increasing labor class power and the defection of autonomous colonies, is also suffering from the expansion of the power of the United States and the Soviet Union in the anti-Axis camp abroad, but it must continue the war. Britain's reason for declaring war on Germany was to guarantee Poland's borders, but today it is at a loss as to what to do about the Soviet Union occupying Polish territory. Britain also had significant interests in the Balkans before the war, but now it cannot prevent it from gradually falling under the influence of the Soviet Union, and is only busy defending the Mediterranean route. In the United States, there are various discussions, such as continuing to borrow the air bases borrowed from Britain after the war, etc., and even advocating that Britain be merged into the United States. Britain cannot protest against this too much. Churchill frequently greets Roosevelt and Stalin, prostrating himself to preserve his sphere of influence, which is Britain's current attitude.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than the consequence of Britain's actions since the start of the war, which has been to take advantage of others. It was the Soviet Union's resistance that contained Germany's power in the East and gave Britain time to breathe. In response, Britain's promised Second Front was delayed. It was the escort of US aircraft carriers that reversed the crisis on its Atlantic transport line; and it was the Lend-Lease Act that supplied Britain with military equipment and food to enable it to continue the war. Even the current Second Front would not be realized without relying on the power of the United States. However, while using the resources of the United States, Britain wants to prevent the United States from interfering in the British Empire, and even wants to bring the countries of Western Europe under its umbrella. Indeed, as British Information Minister Brendan Bracken said when publishing the "Bankruptcy White Paper," Britain "has sacrificed most of the legacy since the Victorian era" in the war, but Britain does not want to work hard itself, but only hopes to use others to restore its losses. Having lost its strength and still trying to preserve its former sphere of influence, I am afraid that there is no other way than to kowtow to the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The road to destruction is indeed wide! While using threats and appeasement to squeeze the self-governing colonies of the British Empire, and relying on the United States and the Soviet Union, the opportunistic policy of always taking advantage of others to seek its own interests will be the basic factor leading to Britain's demise. In the past, Britain had the ambition to fly over the seven seas. When it had huge overseas investments and lived on interest, Britain was only concerned with protecting its family property. Today's Britain, however, does not fully recognize the reality of its declining strength and dreams of a golden age that will never return. The one who destroyed Qin was Qin itself. The collapse of the ancient Roman Empire was due to the decadence of the Romans themselves; the one who will destroy the British Empire will also be the English themselves!

<p>As a result of the exchange of technology and designs between the warring countries, the shapes of small aircraft are almost identical, making them difficult to distinguish. When judging from the ground, the first thing is to be familiar with the planform of enemy and friendly aircraft. Taking this as the main point, several similar Japanese and American small aircraft are shown. As for their horizontal stabilizers, they are generally similar to the main wings. The shape of the vertical stabilizers is quite difficult to distinguish on the ground, but it can be noticed during vertical turns, etc. Secondly, because the vertical stabilizer is far behind the horizontal stabilizer, the aircraft seems very white.</p>
<p>The Japanese "Hien" fighter is the only water-cooled type, and its nose is slender, which is more delicate than the "Hayabusa", "Chung Kui" or the Navy's Zero fighter, and is very easy to distinguish. The spacing between its main wings and tail wings is extremely small. The Chance Vought F4U fighter's main wings are upturned at both ends, forming a W shape when viewed from the front. As for its planform, it is quite ordinary. Also, its vertical stabilizer extends behind the horizontal stabilizer. The Douglas SBD3 with a wingspan of 12.65 meters is described as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese "Chung Kui" fighter's leading edge of the main wing is a straight line, and the trailing edge forms an arc towards both ends, unlike the American Grumman F6F's leading and trailing edges of the main wing that are slanted towards both ends, and is similar to the Curtiss SB2C. Generally speaking, because the head of an aircraft is equipped with a large-horsepower engine with a huge diameter, the fuselage is bound to be thick, but depending on the spacing between the main wing and the horizontal stabilizer, it can make people feel either thick or thin. This point must be carefully studied in the diagram to understand the wing's leading edge is also a straight line, and the trailing edge is inclined forward, with rounded ends, which is different from the Grumman F6F, etc., which have angular ends.</p>
<p>The American Curtiss SB2C is a two-seater aircraft. The main wing is very similar to the "Chung Kui", but it is larger than the horizontal one compared to ordinary fighters. The fuselage between the main wing and the tail wing is thinner, and the tail is upturned. Finally, the Grumman F6F, its shape is quite comical, quite like a washboard mounted on a beer barrel, and is the easiest to distinguish.

<p>Implementation Steps of Evacuation Work</p>
<p>— Yu De</p>
<p>Large-scale evacuation of the population is a complex task, and in the current urgent situation, it is especially hoped that it can be implemented quickly. Now, I will briefly present my views on four steps based on chronological order:</p>
<p>The first step is registration and investigation. During this period, the city's Baojia organizations should register the situation of those who voluntarily evacuate within their jurisdiction according to a unified format, such as the number of evacuees, destination, number of luggage pieces, and economic ability. At the same time, the evacuation committee should cooperate with various hometown associations to investigate the transportation capacity of each transportation line, the price, security, and accommodation capacity of the main evacuation destinations, so as to plan and coordinate in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>The second step is organization and liaison. On the organization side, those with hometown associations should be handled by the hometown associations, and citizens without hometown associations should be divided into teams by the evacuation committee according to their destination, and designated persons in charge of leading and directing each team. On the liaison side, such as increasing the number of train and boat trips, reducing fares, simplifying inspection procedures, and relaxing restrictions. All of these must be completed before the evacuation to avoid temporary chaos and crowding.</p>
<p>The third step is to implement the evacuation. Such as issuing evacuation certificates, collective reporting of household registration, reasonable allocation of transportation, purchase of group boat tickets, and allocation of escorts, and then proceed in batches. The procedures must be simple, and the handling must be fast.</p>
<p>The fourth step is follow-up. The purpose of the evacuation work is not only to solve the difficulties of transportation, but also to take care of the living problems of the evacuees after the evacuation. Otherwise, the evacuation result in Shanghai will cause serious social problems in various places; therefore, in each main evacuation destination, the evacuation committee must also contact the local government and public groups to organize temporary institutions to provide practical and effective assistance in resolving housing rental disputes, household registration declarations, job introductions, and temporary relief.</p>
<p>The current situation is so tense, the possibility of air raids is so great, and the price of rice is so high that all citizens who do not need to stay in Shanghai hope that the evacuation will be implemented as soon as possible. In extraordinary times, only extraordinary methods can be used. It is necessary to avoid the complicated procedures taken in the past in administration, and to seek agility and perfection in everything, and only by reducing the suffering of the evacuees can the success of the evacuation work be achieved. Two prerequisites for evacuation work.</p>
<h3>Transportation and Security are Two Prerequisites for Evacuation Work</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhonghua</p>
<p>Since the enemy planes have bombed many times, the citizens, in view of the terror of air raids, coupled with the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood at present, many citizens are willing to evacuate voluntarily to safer places—the countryside. However, the difficulty of purchasing black market train and boat tickets, and the extortion of red and black hats, and the poor security in the countryside, all make voluntary evacuees want to go but stop again. Now the municipal authorities have established an organization of the Evacuation Population Committee for the evacuation of the population. The Shen Bao has specially opened the Shanghai Municipal Affairs column to solicit the opinions of citizens for the reference of the authorities. The author is willing to offer a humble opinion from the citizens' point of view, without taking the liberty.</p>
<p>Increasing transportation and eliminating the black market are prerequisites for the evacuation of the population. It can be asserted that if these two cannot be done, the evacuation work will be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Like the recent trips between Shanghai and Ningbo, only one "Ningshao" ship is available. If it travels to Ningbo seven times a month, with 7,000 passengers each time, it will only be 50,000 people in a month. Also, like the black market train tickets, it is said that they have been sold for more than 10,000 yuan. Assuming that an evacuated family has four people and five pieces of luggage, the train ticket alone requires 50,000 yuan, and each piece of luggage requires 4,000 yuan, which requires 20,000 yuan, plus the extortion of porters and the blackmail along the way, an evacuation of a family costs no less than 100,000 yuan. How can a salaried class afford this huge expense? Therefore, the authorities' evacuation of the population work should first solve the above two major problems.</p>
<p>In recent years, bandits have sprung up in the countryside, and security is poor. The war has caused all industries to wither, unemployment is increasing, and prices are soaring, and life is becoming increasingly difficult, so there are many people who have been forced to become bandits. However, the failure of politics to get on track, allowing corrupt officials, hooligans, and local bullies to run rampant everywhere, is also a major reason. For example, the author's hometown of Qijia in Zhenhai has been robbed four times, which is evident. Now the authorities are evacuating the population, starting with the unemployed and vagrants. If they are evacuated to the countryside without appropriate disposal measures, it will be enough to disturb the local area. The author sincerely hopes that the authorities will consider three times when evacuating vagrants, so as to seek perfection.</p>
<p>My hometown of Xinlaozhou is one of the major towns in Zhenhai. In the past, there were thousands of households, making it the crown of each village. Now, nine out of ten houses are empty, which is unspeakably desolate. The political problems, ramparts everywhere, and the wind of robbery are heard every day. The villagers cannot withstand the threats, and most of them have moved to the cities, and there are many who have come to Shanghai to live. Since my hometown is like this, how can other villages be different? Therefore, when evacuating the population, the authorities are especially hoped to do well in rural security.</p>
<h3>The Treatment of Baojia Personnel</h3>
<p>— Huang Gong'an</p>
<p>The Baojia organization in Shanghai has been in existence for more than two years. In these two years, although I dare not say that it has made some real contributions to society, the elimination of thieves, the subjugation of evil-doers, self-defense, the maintenance of security, the promotion of air defense, and all other public organizations, the Baojia has made the greatest effort.</p>
<p>The Baojia is the link between the government and the people. Above, it promotes laws and regulations, transmits and implements government policies; below, it conveys public opinion, contributes reviews of the demands of the people, and cooperates in promoting municipal administration. The Baojia is an organization of the people, assisting the government, maintaining social order, supporting the good, eliminating the evil, and serving the public.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou said: "The Baojia organization should promote the government and assist the government." He also said: "In the future, the municipal government will distribute goods, and I hope the Baojia will assist." Secretary-General Luo said: "The Baojia has assisted the military and police and has achieved results, and the reporting of all bad elements depends on the cooperation of the Baojia's self-police. The Baojia has the responsibility to supervise and report all crimes in society."</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the Baojia are so important, and their work is worthy of the country and the people. But what about the lives of those who directly engage in Baojia work? Let us study it.</p>
<p>Before the recovery of the concessions, the Lianbao of the French Concession had a monthly subsidy of 450 yuan as office expenses, and the salaries of the staff were also paid from this. After the recovery of the concessions, the office expenses of each Lianbao increased to 1,500 yuan, but it was not paid for a long time. In July of the 33rd year, after the unified collection of Baojia funds, each Lianbao received 7,500 yuan a month for office expenses, and each Bao also received 5,000 yuan a month for office expenses. However, the scope of the Bao and Lianbao has been expanded to seven times that of the past, and the previously owed funds have been written off and will no longer be mentioned.</p>
<p>Each Baochang has set up a Bao office, hiring one or two staff members. After deducting 1,000 to 2,000 yuan for necessary items such as ink, stationery, and paper from the office expenses, there are only 3,000 to 4,000 yuan left. Moreover, the superior also deducts odds and ends. The staff can only get 1,000 to 2,000 yuan from these deducted leftovers as monthly living expenses, as the price of a month of hard work. On the Lianbao side, due to the increase in printed materials, after deducting the rest, each staff member can only get this little bit.</p>
<p>Starting from the 34th year, although the Baojia Department increased the Baojia fee, preparing to double the office expenses to improve the treatment of Baojia personnel, but after the increase, each Bao can get 15,000 yuan a month, and each Lianbao can get 22,500 yuan a month. Even if there are no expenses deducted, all of it is used as staff subsidies, and each person can only get 7,500 yuan. In today's soaring living standards, the kind-hearted seek other jobs, or take on side jobs; the evil-doers use their power to extort good people, making the people fear or resent the Baojia. The Baojia's work is not active today, which is produced under this situation.</p>
<p>Recently, the government authorities have been vigorously cleaning up corruption and establishing a clean government, and the Baojia, which is in direct contact with the people and has a great relationship, has produced this situation, which is really distressing. Of course, "in times of chaos, heavy penalties are used." But you can't work with an empty stomach, you always have to eat and dress warmly to do things.</p>
<p>Today, we dare not ask to increase office expenses, so as not to increase the Baojia fee paid by the people to disturb the people; but we hope that the government authorities, when implementing key distribution, will include us in the ranks of public officials, and issue key distribution uniformly, so as to stabilize our lives and work hard in the position of the Baojia.</p>
<h3>Price Limits and Refusal to Sell</h3>
<p>Amidst the relentless rise in prices, the Shanghai Economic Bureau recently assessed price limits for sixteen kinds of commodities. Upon seeing the announcement of the new price limits, it seemed that the stipulated prices were not particularly low. It is evident that the authorities considered the cost of each item, the profits of the merchants, and all other aspects, and it cannot be deemed unreasonable or unfair.</p>
<p>However, on the merchant side, many still felt that the price limits assessed by the Economic Bureau were too low to allow for exorbitant profits, leaving them unsatisfied. Under the Economic Bureau's strict order not to sell above the limit, they did not dare openly express opposition or secretly raise prices for sale. But merchants have their own methods and means, which is refusal to sell. They felt that the new price limits were not enough to satisfy their desire for wealth, so they hoarded goods and implemented a refusal to sell.</p>
<p>The most prominent example of this is cooking oil. The new price limit was 620 yuan per catty (approximately 1.1 lbs). Before the announcement, cooking oil could be bought everywhere. Once the announcement was made, going to any oil shop, they all unanimously claimed to be sold out. Although some oil shops were selling oil at the limited price under the supervision of the authorities, only half a catty per person, because the space was limited, long queues and jostling were observed.</p>
<p>We can conclude that most oil shops have oil, but they are hiding it and refusing to sell it because the limited price cannot satisfy their desires. Cooking oil is a daily necessity for citizens and is indispensable. Now that household oil cannot be rationed on schedule, and black market cooking oil is being refused for sale by merchants, citizens are already suffering from a lack of oil.</p>
<p>If this problem is allowed to continue, the public's fear regarding cooking oil will only intensify. I believe that in addition to enforcing the new price limits, the authorities should go a step further and thoroughly investigate the oil merchants' and oil shops' stock. If they discover hoarding oil and refusing to sell it, they should be severely punished. Otherwise, price limits will be just price limits. When merchants think the price limits are too low, they will refuse to sell, and apart from cooking oil, other goods among the sixteen newly limited-price commodities might follow the example of cooking oil and implement a refusal to sell!</p>

<h3>Homeless Man</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>Lao Fang is a strange man. Among his peers, he is lonely; but in the group of children, he does not lose his innocent vitality.</p>
<p>"He's been ready to find a wife for a long time, yet he's still with the children, aren't you afraid?" The cook, A Fa, always jokingly teased him half in jest and half seriously.</p>
<p>Ying saw that he was tall and big, yet sensitive and meticulous. Perhaps this sentence touched his sorrow. Think about it: he's thirty years old, has been wandering for many years, yet is just a tea server at a school. Of course, he has to be alone, unable to afford a wife. He felt ashamed, and his face really turned red.</p>
<p>He can't love women, so he loves children.</p>
<p>In the evening, as soon as the back door opened, he would come out looking for the children; no, it could also be said that the children came out looking for him. The children formed an inextricable bond with him. They liked him, listened to him, and greeted him by calling him "old friend".</p>
<p>"Come on, kids! I'll give you some candy." Lao Fang raised his hand, holding a few pieces of peanut candy.</p>
<p>The children immediately snatched them, surrounding his legs, chewing the candy he distributed with relish, looking up at his kind face with interest.</p>
<p>"Old friend, didn't you take Xiao Liu and them to see Shaoxing opera last time? Would you take us again tonight?" One child hooked his arm.</p>
<p>"Um, --uh." Lao Fang rummaged in his pockets, and had to answer evasively.</p>
<p>But in a few days, he secretly took three or four children to the Golden Grand Theater. At night, when the children returned, they said with great interest: "Old friend is really good, he took us there, and we even rode in that red car, it was really fast and comfortable. During the opera, old friend told us in detail what the one singing in a loud voice was called, and what the one pinching his throat was called. Later, when we came out, we all clamored to be hungry, and he took us to a restaurant to eat mutton noodles before coming back."</p>
<p>Everyone knew that he was very frugal. Originally, what money could a tea server earn? However, he would generously use his accumulated hard-earned money for the children. The children's parents all said he was a kind person and often asked him to come to their homes to play, but he had a peculiarity that did not match his burly body, which was that he was afraid of meeting strangers, so he never went to people's homes. Only when people had children, held full-moon parties, or celebrated birthdays, he would reluctantly send a small gift, shyly step into the door, hug the child warmly, and shed tears of joy.</p>
<p>One day, he exceptionally bought a few catties of meat and old wine. He asked the old woman in number nine lane to cook the meat for him, and then invited me and another neighbor to accompany him for drinks.</p>
<p>Once the wine entered his stomach, he became more talkative.</p>
<p>"If there were no children to play with me, my life would be so boring!" He shook his head with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"You like children so much, why don't you like women?" The old woman interjected: "Think about it, if you have a woman, you will have children too, haha!"</p>
<p>"Women all look down on me, but I only have one woman in my heart. She was a good girl: silky hair, dark red cheeks, bell-like laughter, and a cheerful personality. I fell in love with her, and suddenly one day, she was forcibly taken away by an evil spirit and defiled. She was a chaste girl, she didn't want to live anymore, so she jumped into the water. In this way, I lost her forever. After losing her, I can't forget her, and I don't think about other women anymore." He said quickly and passionately, his face flushed.</p>
<p>"Even so, you are so old, you should go back and find a woman from your hometown." My neighbor comforted him.</p>
<p>"Go back? Where do I go back to?"</p>
<p>So I asked him where he was from.</p>
<p>"I don't even know it myself. I only remember when I was a child, my father took me wandering everywhere, from the south to the north, and from the north to the south, but we still couldn't fill our stomachs. Of all the places, we lived in Jinhua, Zhejiang for the longest time, and it can barely be said to be my hometown. The scenery there is really good: there are mountains forever, there is water in the mountains, the water is green and the mountains are blue, how lovely it is! But unfortunately, my father died there. Looking back, the green mountains and green waters are always dotted with my father's purple bloodstains. I'm scared, I'm sad, I can't bear to go to such a lovely place again, and I can't bear to see the long green grass on my father's grave!..." His tears dripped into the wine glass, but he lifted it up and drank it with the wine and tears.</p>
<p>This couldn't help but evoke my memories of passing through eastern Zhejiang a few years ago: sitting on a simple folk boat drifting on the transparent green stream, I once forgot the pain of wandering and fully enjoyed the winding and beautiful mountain scenery. The water is not locked, so it is called a stream. And the mountains, the mountains stand in the water, forming strange and steep cliffs. But it is not a straight and whole piece, but also winding and craggy, with a heroic beauty contained in the majesty. The boat glides through a section of plain, and as it turns a corner, a stack of peaks suddenly flies into view, giving people a startling admiration... Thinking of this beautiful scenery, I also had sympathetic feelings with him.</p>
<p>We drank silently for a while. Seeing that the meat was almost finished, he stood up and said with a hoarse voice: "I really want to invite you to drink and chat again. Really, living alone is too lonely!... But I'm afraid this opportunity will be difficult to have."</p>
<p>"Being alone is free, you can do what you want to do."</p>
<p>He thought for a while, then nodded and laughed loudly: "Yes, considering the four seas as home, maybe it's a kind of fun for people like me."</p>
<p>He tried to leave, but suddenly turned around, took my hand and said lowly: "I don't want to stay here anymore. I always remember a friend from a few years ago, who said he was going to find a meaningful life and asked me to go with him, but I never agreed. Thinking about it now, I really regret it..."</p>
<p>So he turned around and strode away.</p>
<p>I didn't see him for many days. One evening, my little brother came home from school and told me anxiously, "Old friend is gone!"</p>
<p>"Where did he go?"</p>
<p>"Who knows?"</p>
<p>Only then did I realize that his last meat-cooking wine invitation was his final farewell to me.</p>
<p>Thinking of him under the lamp, I couldn't help but remember the two lines of poetry "From now on, the four seas are home, the autumn wind is blowing through the reeds".</p>
<p>In his future wandering life, I hope there will be no more autumn leaves.</p>
<h3>Appeal</h3>
<p>— Fang Xuan</p>
<p>These few days my mood is extremely bad. Why does fate treat our kind group so harshly? This is what I doubt most. Thinking of my own things, which I rely on to make a living, being forcibly taken away by others, even the most magnanimous person cannot avoid being angry. But what can I do? My things have already been taken away by others, and this person has declared bankruptcy. I remember his smug look in the judicial office of the police station, as if he was not being sanctioned by the law, but being protected by the law.</p>
<p>"If you want it, this is the number!" He said firmly, spitting loudly. It was very obvious that he offered half the market price to seize other people's things, and then used this "surplus" amount to seek favors outside the law!</p>
<p>— Is this a world with laws?</p>
<p>I saw the lawyer he hired eagerly pursuing his own desires, offering each other cigarettes, and I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>But — who told us to be so poor? We can't afford a lawyer to negotiate with him! We had to withdraw from the group of victims and "settle privately" with him alone. He designated his wife to negotiate, and one snowy morning, we rushed to his home.</p>
<p>His wife was still in bed. She yawned, stretched, and slowly got out of bed. She opened her wallet, took out a cigarette case, wrote on the back in her husband's handwriting, and said with a straight face:</p>
<p>"Write a receipt according to this writing, don't be indecisive."</p>
<p>I picked up the note with trembling hands. What is this? He wants me to admit that I took back the original thing? — God, what I got from you is less than half of what you seized. Even a robber should show some conscience. Why do you want me to write such a receipt?</p>
<p>Even the mediator he hired felt that the other party was too ruthless. He hesitated, rubbing his hands, and took a cold breath and said:</p>
<p>"Then you draft a receipt yourself, go to the police station to see Mr. X, and write it after you agree!"</p>
<p>I nodded, opened the door and walked out, and behind me came the woman's sharp voice:</p>
<p>"Go see him, he's not angry! — Humph!" This sentence made me tremble all over as if ice water was flowing down my spine. Is it only the vicious people in this world who deserve to speak, and is "reason" on their mouths?</p>
<p>After I drafted a more reasonable receipt, I went to the police station to see him. He looked at the note for a long time and laughed in his nose:</p>
<p>"Then I'll give it to you cheap!"</p>
<p>He took out a checkbook from his side and signed two checks. I took the checks and asked stutteringly:</p>
<p>"Mr. X, will these checks be returned when they are due?"</p>
<p>"Of course, how could my checks be returned... You know I have some property besides being detained!"</p>
<p>He said seriously, and I couldn't help but laugh at my own stupidity.</p>
<p>Yes, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, I will be able to get a sum of money that is neither too big nor too small. I can safely get through this year-end, but after this year-end, how should I live my life?</p>
<p>It is illegal to be a robber — the so-called law may be a threat to us!</p>
<h3>Bitter Leaves</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xia</p>
<p>I remember back then, when I first tasted the bitter leaves of love,</p>
<p>How did I spend those long nights:</p>
<p>Silent tears fell all over the pillow,</p>
<p>And then cried the back of the pillow wet until dawn.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>Now, there is only this unspeakable astringent knot,</p>
<p>Lost the sigh, and can't even remember a complaint.</p>
<p>Looking at the distant lights, that ball of halo waxes and wanes,</p>
<p>The eyes, like a shallow pool at the bottom of a dry well, are sucked dry by the barrenness again.</p>
<p>I only wonder how my heart was so tender back then?</p>
<p>Yet now it cannot squeeze out a drop of juice;</p>
<p>The golden-tailed love has dried into a dead fish,</p>
<p>No longer paddling, only turning up its grey-white belly.</p>
<h3>Piano Genius Franz Liszt</h3>
<p>— You Shanhu</p>
<p>Franz Liszt happened to be a century earlier than Hollywood's big star Robert Taylor. From the age of fifteen until his death at the age of seventy-five, there was never a moment when women did not surround him, flatter him, tempt him, kiss his hand, desire his body, threaten him with suicide, and fight each other to compete for the public lover.</p>
<p>These crazed women cut off his hair and hid it in their hearts and on their chests. They fought to drink the coffee he left over. They collected the oranges and chairs he sat on, because they had been pressed by his immortal buttocks.</p>
<p>Liszt liked this: he was fond of women. His father, Adam Liszt, was originally a steward in a Hungarian family. In order to cultivate his son and make him a standout among men, he was willing to give up his job. When he was dying, he still told his son on his sickbed: women would ruin him. At that time, he was only sixteen years old.</p>
<p>In less than a year, the French Minister of Industry and Commerce returned home after midnight and discovered that his daughter was with this important figure in the living room. The young people said that they had fallen in love while learning music. The father opened the door and kicked him out. After that, Liszt withdrew from social life and lived a monastic life for two years.</p>
<p>As a result, he transformed into Europe's most romantic youth, leading a dengue fever-like social life, revolving between Parisian salons and private residences, sometimes self-deprecating and self-pitying, and sometimes self-respecting.</p>
<p>His first scandal was eloping with Countess d'Agoult. The countess, named Marie, was intelligent, charming, but a bit picky, nicknamed "Six feet of snow on twenty feet of volcanic lava."</p>
<p>The two lived together in Switzerland and Italy for four years and had three children: Blandine, Cosima, and Daniel.</p>
<p>Marie gave up everything for her beloved: money, reputation, status, relatives and friends. She did her best to make him live well and work quietly; but for him it was only for three months. Every time he moved to a new place, he gradually invited guests, filling his house, and mingling with the local first-class high society. Banquets and hunting became his daily tasks. But his wife Marie always stayed at home. Occasionally, he would sneak off to Paris alone, returning home after a month or two. He claimed to be raising money for a charity fund. He ran to Vienna, and from then on, he became famous and became the most famous "piano-virtuoso" (piano virtuoso who plays impromptu without sheet music).</p>
<p>Liszt traveled around Europe for ten years, performing everywhere, and was welcomed everywhere. Art-obsessed students and wildly desperate women flattered him in every way. Medals, gifts, invitations... were constantly sent to him; money flowed like water, and he spent it like water. He disturbed and sensationalized every capital! Lisbon, Saint Petersburg, London, Constantinople.</p>
<p>Every week, he wrote a letter to Marie, describing his success: "I am at the top of this city, especially among the nobility and women... The king is very polite to me... I am the lion of the London season here." At the same time, every week, jealous friends wrote letters to Marie, exposing his recent amorous affairs: actress Planer, Princess Bai Qiaozhuosa, Mrs. Sha Moluo, and Europe's most famous prostitute Luo Limontan.</p>
<p>Marie endured for six years, and finally left in despair, saying that he was a nouveau riche-style "Don Juan" (European lover), a big liar!</p>
<p>Liszt performed everywhere, showing off his unparalleled talent. His long hair, sparkling eyes, large nostrils, and sad expression became the paradigm of contemporary impromptu pianists. He changed a new tie every day, and then wore a large Hungarian shawl, slowly took off the green leather gloves on his hands, and threw them on the ground before officially starting to play.</p>
<p>In Russia, he traveled on a Spanish-style sailboat, with a dining room, bedroom, and kitchen in the boat. In Germany, people pre-arranged a piano at each train station, and when the train arrived, they invited him out to perform.</p>
<p>He would not flatter the dignitaries. He once refused to perform for the French King Louis Philippe, because he was a usurper who stole the throne. He refused Bolivia's Rutilio I, because he had an affair with the famous prostitute Lola Montez; he refused Spain's Queen Isabella, because according to their etiquette, he could not introduce the queen.</p>
<p>This was not excessive arrogance. In that era, musicians were regarded as servants and could only enter the room to perform after the host allowed it, and meals were enjoyed in the kitchen. So with his actions, musicians were able to raise their heads, become proud, and win a noble position in society.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he gave up everything and became a music consultant in Weimar, Germany, with a salary of one thousand yuan a year. He no longer played for money. He conducted the orchestra, composed music, and wanted to establish permanent honor.</p>
<p>Several times, he almost married Princess Wittgenstein. The last time, everything was ready, but the princess suddenly changed her mind. He hid alone, smoking a cigar, and completed the twenty-five volume book: "The External Causes of the Decline of the Church Interior".</p>
<p>Liszt was always a high-class lecher who seduced good women. When he died of pneumonia in a train at the age of seventy-five from a cold, many women were still surrounding him, vying to take care of him. His daughter was so angry that she refused to give him the brandy he had to drink.</p>
<p>In addition to his private life, which was fought over by groups of women, in music history, he completed twelve symphonic poems, "Faust" and "Dante". As for his yearning for "futurist music", it was never completed. This is also a strange genius in the history of music.</p>

<h3>Basketball League A and B Groups: Hua Lian and Zhong Bei Stand Side by Side; Disputes in A and B Groups between Zhong Bei B and Dong Hua; Women's Group Green Team Achieves Perfect Victory Record</h3>
<p>The battle schedule for the third Shanghai Basketball League, Groups A and B, and the women's group, has been completed and should have come to an end. Unexpectedly, due to Hua Lian and Zhong Bei each winning one game, the championship could not be produced, and a final battle is still needed. However, due to venue issues (West Qing is no longer available for borrowing), the date and location will be determined by the board of directors. According to Chairman Dai Changling: The two teams tied for the championship in the Shenbao Cup, but it was agreed to compete once again for scholarship funds for the Shenbao authorities. This opportunity can be used to achieve a win-win situation, which the two teams will definitely agree to, and is also to fulfill the previous agreement, so fans can wait for good news. This article reviews Hua Lian's victory over Zhong Bei in the second cycle of Group A, my opinion on the dispute between Zhong Bei B and Dong Hua in Group A and B, and introduces the advantages of the women's champion Green Team, as a general review before the basketball league's Group A and women's group are about to come to a successful conclusion.</p>
<h3>Review of the China United vs. Zhongbei Match</h3>
<p>In the first round, Zhongbei defeated China United, which was commented on last week. Their second round rematch took place on Wednesday this week (February 28th) at 5:30 PM at the Xiqing Billiard Hall. Fans, awed by the great reputations of these masters from the North and South and knowing future opportunities would be rare, rushed to secure tickets, fearing they'd miss out. Despite the high ticket prices of 500 to 2000 yuan, the venue was packed, with no space to spare, surpassing the attendance of the first match by half, creating a truly grand spectacle. The weather that day was oppressively hot, intensified by the crowd's energy, causing moisture to drip from the billiard hall's walls, making the court slippery. This was the only flaw in the event.</p>
<p>Before this game, China United's [character unclear] was sick, leading many to worry about China United and predict another Zhongbei victory. However, after the match began, China United immediately found their rhythm. Their chosen lineup and man-marking strategies proved to be key to their success. For instance, replacing Wu Chengzhang with Bert to guard Chen Xuesong was a calculated move based on the weaknesses exposed in the previous game, assigning the right person to the defensive job. This must be attributed to Zhang Xiang's skillful use of strategy. China United's offensive methods were particularly successful, as the man-marking tactic required using screens during attacks. In my review of their first match, I pointed out that both sides used too few screens. This time, China United used this method extensively in their attacks. Zhang Liangxiong and Bert were able to score more points largely because Xi Xilin took the lead in setting screens, creating opportunities for them to penetrate the defense. Additionally, the refereeing was very strict this time, resulting in China United having four players fouled out. However, thanks to their deep bench and Coach Zhang's effective management, they were able to cope throughout the game and secure the victory, which is truly commendable. The reason for Zhongbei's defeat was their defensive strategy, which failed to stop the opponent's screening tactics. Their offensive approach remained stubbornly traditional, which China United recognized and countered effectively, preventing them from scoring easily. Furthermore, the slippery court disadvantaged Zhongbei's taller players, making them more prone to losing balance. The Northern style, known for its fancy techniques, was harder to execute due to the court conditions, which contributed to their failure. Finally, after three players were fouled out, and Shen Yugong was injured and unable to play, Zhongbei was left with only four players, making a comeback impossible. When down to four players, Li Zhenzhong strenuously advocated for focusing on gaining possession rather than trying to reverse the defeat. This showed great insight and leadership. In man-marking tactics and in a match between two evenly matched teams, it's impossible to win against a majority when outnumbered. Therefore, it's better to minimize the point difference to improve the final record. In the end, China United won 39 to 34, avenging their previous loss and making a rematch necessary. The fans were truly treated to a spectacle.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Zhongbei B and Donghua</h3>
<p>Among the teams in Groups A and B, Zhongbei B and Donghua were the strongest, each having defeated strong opponents. When these two teams met, it was like a final match, extremely tense. Donghua held a lead throughout, but unfortunately, in the last eight minutes, with Donghua leading 30 to 22, referee Wang Ji'en made an erroneous call. The fact was that Zhongbei B's Wang Jinghu dribbled deep, and Donghua's Tan Fuzhen forcefully blocked him, resulting in a foul. As the whistle blew, the ball simultaneously went into the basket from Zhongbei B's Shen Yuan's hand. Wang Ji'en ruled that the basket counted, and Tan Fuzhen committed a foul. At that moment, Donghua's captain Jia Youliang questioned the referee, stating that Tan Fuzhen's foul was against Wang Jinghu, but the shooter was Shen Da. Since the foul occurred before the basket, how could the basket be counted? However, Wang Ji'en was determined to stick to his mistake. Eventually, Donghua refused to continue the game, and Wang hastily declared Zhonghua the winner. Later, Donghua appealed to the Basketball Federation's board of directors, but the authorities have yet to make a public announcement. This has left the championship title for Groups A and B unresolved. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the authorities will make an official announcement soon, as the public is deeply concerned about this matter. I have heard that the authorities are preparing to reject Donghua's protest, giving their full reasons. However, I suggest that Zhongbei B agree to a friendly match with Donghua. If Zhongbei B wins, Donghua should accept it calmly. If Zhongbei B loses and Donghua wins, then even if Donghua cannot claim the championship, they can at least vent their frustration. This is a humane approach, but it may not be agreed upon by the authorities or both parties.</p>
<h3>Green Team's Unblemished Record</h3>
<p>In the women's division, the Green Team has won all ten of its games, with each victory by a significant margin, demonstrating the team's true ability. The dedication of Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin is the reason for this excellent result. Since its founding, the Green Team has never lost in round-door ball, volleyball, or basketball. This is enough to make them the envy of any team in Shanghai. Looking back at Shanghai's sporting history, no team has ever achieved this. Here is a brief assessment of the advantages of this women's team:</p>
<h3>Sharp and Unmatched Forwards, Rotating Guards</h3>
<p>The Green Team's forwards are generally center Yan Weiwei, right forward Huang Mingyuan, and left forward Rong Feijian. Captain Li Zhi is often on the bench, allowing her to observe key gains and losses alongside Coach Qian. All three forwards have accurate shooting skills. Yan Weiwei relies on her height and never misses when receiving passes from the backcourt. Huang Mingyuan excels at cutting and following up. Rong Shujian, a veteran player, is steady and reliable, and her left-handed layup is almost always successful. Furthermore, the three players' teamwork has reached a point of deep understanding, making them swift and skilled. This has reached the highest level of mastery. The guards are Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Yinlan. Women's defense generally relies on man-marking. However, when the defense is focused on tightly marking the offense, there are always gaps, or when the opponent uses screens, there will be opportunities. The Green Team's three guards effectively use rotating man-marking, based on the above situations. Depending on the positioning and the opponent's tactics, they must switch assignments, saving energy and minimizing gaps. Therefore, the Green Team's three guards are often seen exchanging assignments in tacit understanding, preventing the opposing forwards from attacking.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that each of these six women has individual weaknesses that should be pointed out, in the hope that they will strive for perfection, not to nitpick. Yan Weiwei often wastes opportunities, Huang Mingyuan sometimes lacks composure, Rong Shujian often commits traveling after getting the ball, Wang Weizhen commits too many unnecessary fouls, Liu Zhenbao lacks speed, and Ren Yinlan is not serious enough. These are all minor points, but if they can be eliminated or improved, they can certainly reach the next level. What do you think, Xucang?</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of Miss Wu Zhenxiong, Member of the China Film Women's Basketball Team, on Her Wedding Day</h3>
<p>Miss Wu Zhenxiong, daughter of Wu Wenchao, a key figure in the China Film Sports Association, celebrated her wedding day a few days ago (the 2nd). Miss Wu is also a pillar of the China Film Women's Basketball Team.</p>
<p>The groom is said to be an athlete as well. The wedding was held at the Four Sisters Cafe.</p>
<p>Because Wu Wenchao is an active figure in both the sports and film circles, many people from both industries attended, making the event extremely lively.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony was simple yet solemn. The master of ceremonies was film star Huang He, who had a beautiful voice.</p>
<p>The introducer, Han Langen, gave a speech with his usual humor. He said, "I am a ready-made matchmaker. The reason they invited me is because I have many children, and the bride and groom hope to have many children and grandchildren as well."</p>
<p>Guest Yin Xiucen said in his speech, "The fat man said that the bride and groom hate speakers who talk too much, so I won't say much. I hope that next year on this day, we will be invited to eat red eggs. May their union be as fat as me, Yin Xiucen."</p>
<p>After the wedding ceremony, refreshments were served. The guests requested that the Four Sisters sing. After repeated applause, the eldest sister, Xi Qiuxia, finally went to the microphone and sang the new song "Is It a Dream or Is It Real?" Her crisp and melodious voice satisfied everyone. As Xi's sister's song echoed, I left early, unable to hear the voices of Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Chen Juanjuan.</p>
<h3>Essentials of Basketball Theory (13)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>The main purpose of pivoting is to maintain individual ball control and evade the opponent's defense. There are two main methods: (1) Forward pivot. This method is often used when the opponent is tracking from behind and trying to steal the ball. For example, when the opponent is approaching from behind, if they are positioned to the right, lift the right foot and pivot forward to the left or backward. Conversely, if they are positioned to the left, lift the left foot and pivot forward to the right or backward to escape. However, the pivoting foot depends on the position of the feet after stopping. If both feet land simultaneously and balanced, either foot can be lifted. If the feet are staggered and do not land simultaneously, only the front foot can be lifted. The back foot cannot leave its original position, otherwise, it is traveling. (2) Backward pivot. This method is often used when dribbling forward and encountering an opponent blocking the way. After stopping the dribble, if the distance between the player and the defender is less than one yard, to avoid touching the opponent's body and committing a personal foul, only a backward pivot can be used to get away from the opponent, turning one's back to them so they cannot easily steal the ball. When stopping, if both feet land simultaneously, either foot can be lifted and the body can be turned backward to the left or right. If the feet are staggered and do not land simultaneously, only the front foot or the last foot to land can be lifted to pivot. There are more than just these two pivoting methods, but other methods can be adapted from these two. The main purpose of pivoting is to keep one's body between the opponent and the ball being held, to prevent the opponent from stealing it. Those who can properly use various pivoting techniques will be able to adapt to the situation, cleverly break through the opponent's defense, or make various feints and bluffs to deceive the opponent and attack them by surprise.</p>
<h3>Sports Miscellany</h3>
<p>The Football League Group A match between Donghua and Chailian is scheduled for today (the 4th) at 10:00 AM at the Race Course. Due to yesterday's rain, it may be postponed again. Hopefully, it will be clear today, so the match can take place.</p>
<p>The Dahua Basketball Team plans to host a women's basketball league on its own court. Judging by the booming development of women's basketball teams in Shanghai, it is expected to be a lively event.</p>
<p>Liu Fushen, formerly a pillar of the South China Basketball Team and now a member of Zhongbei B, has made rapid progress in his skills. Chen Xuesong appreciates Fushen very much. (Da Ke)</p>
