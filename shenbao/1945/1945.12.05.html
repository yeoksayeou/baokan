<p>日前中宣部吳部長對路透社記者說：「共產黨有中國分裂為二之企圖。」驟聽之下，我們似乎不能相信，卻又不能不相信。陪都十六個文化團體宣言說得好，建設最先，建國第一；擁護統一，反對分裂。我們相信，只要是中國人，誰都願望如此。何况共黨又常以民主，和平，團結相號召，要說他們企圖把好容易獲得勝利的中國分裂爲二，似非人情之常。可是從共黨這幾年來尤其這幾月間的軍事行動來觀察，從共軍參謀長葉劍英準備作戰十年的談話來推敵，那吳部長所測度的話也未必完全無稽。國家是大家的，人民所共有的，旣非國民黨一黨所得而專有，亦非共產黨一黨所得而分割。當此千鈞一髮的關頭，我們願站在與論界的地位，代表國民，完全善意的向中國共產黨勸告幾句話。</p>
<p>第一，政黨可以有政爭，却不可以有兵爭，此為民主國家之常道。况中國正需在民主搖籃中成長，戰後人民允渴望休養生息，任何政黨此時第一義即無過於如何使人民能安居樂業。故舍和平政爭而擁兵作亂，縱有千萬好聽的名詞也決不能使人民蹄向。共黨在戰前江西的作風，以及二萬五千里流竄的殘跡，都使人民聞「共」色變。好容易抗戰機會到來，共黨自願一致抗敵，政府亦能寬大爲懷，八年之間，縱不免有若千磨擦，總算因爲大敵當前，勉强相忍爲國。而共黨也多少自悔已往的失策，高呼「馬列主義中國化」，竭力想從政治設施及主義宣傳方面爭取國人之同情。我們關民原無成見，從延安來往的人看來，也多少承認共黨有些朝氣，且有若干新辦法，因而寄以期望。爲共黨計，抗戰勝利，正是他們爭取全國同情的大好機會。國民黨旣早宣布取消軍隊黨部，以爲軍隊國家化之初步實施、共產黨就該乘此時機，自釋兵權，還軍於國。爭論整編幾師，已覺所見者小，而况前經商定的三人小組會議，研究整編共黨軍隊的，竟因葉劍英氏之姍姍來遲，蹉跎數月，一無眉目，其將何以自解於國人？共黨舍其政爭之長，偏好用其兵爭之短，以致人民在過去數年中縱然多少對共黨寄以同情，此時亦將喪失殆盡，這是最可惜不過的。須知中國人民，表面最柔順，最無力，而實際則淸議是非最堅强亦最有力。我們老百姓一向寬大，對政黨間別的爭執都可饒恕，惟有對甘心破壞統一，分裂中國者，一定認爲人民的公敵，國家的罪人。毛澤東氏留渝期間，也許體會到人民這種意向，所以高呼擁護國民政府，擁護蔣主席，而何以一回延安，共黨軍隊即到處阻撓國民政府派遣軍隊的受降，到處妨礙蔣主席命令的執行？這樣割據作亂的兵　，絕不像願意建設民主中國的一個大政黨所做出來的事，也絕不會得到一般人民普徧而眞誠的愛戴。故縱不為國家計而僅爲共黨計，共黨也應改弦易轍，交出軍權，放棄兵爭，與國民黨在主義宣傳及政治設施上埋頭去競賽，纔可有其前途，否則共黨勢將自絕於國人！。</p>
<p>第二，民無信不立，無論古今中外，要在政府地位有所作爲，不可不先取得人民的信仰。政黨在朝時固須如此，在野時亦何嘗不如此？「盜亦有道」，何况政黨？政黨之所以有價值，不一定要就在朝在來判斷。在朝者未必全是；在野者亦未必全非。在朝者能盡在朝實施的職守，在野者能負在野監督的責任，則政治脩明，豈非相得益彰？故由今日中國人民的眼光看來，共黨與其硬要跳上舞台，夾入在朝之列，不如權且安於在野，執行公正無私的監督，反於一國家有裨益，反爲人民所歡迎。若因在朝無分，爭之不得，就不惜鋌而走險，稱兵作亂，那　是中國歷史上羣雄割據老戲的重演，而不是現代民主國家政黨的新作風，眞所謂策之下者。又况政黨取信於人民，首貴政治主張支票之兌現。在野時濫開支票，將來兌現與否，人民一時還難看穿，故在野黨較在朝黨爲容易發展。今共黨之在中國，恰是佔着這種便宜。可惜共黨不知道因利乘便，自己先樹起信用來。共產黨人今天一面開支票，一面就自己退票，空頭支票愈多，人民就愈懷疑厭惡。共黨天天嚷着國軍發動內戰而他們是在解放人民。殊不知人民不是全屬童騃，天下耳目也非一手所能掩盡。誰在阻變最高統帥的命令？誰在攻擊奉命受降的國軍？誰在全國各地，南起粵東，北迄綏察，到處襲擊國軍，侵佔城邑？誠如傳作義將軍所說，究竟誰打人，誰挨打，一　地圖，不辨自明。共黨一面否認爲武裝政黨，而一面去每次談判要求擴編武裝隊伍，且美其名曰人民的軍隊。共黨一面大喊反對內戰，而一面却由其參謀長公然發言，準備作戰十年。諸如此類，何能取言於人民？嘗聞江南父老說笑話，共黨共軍所到之處有所謂「三」者，即人民初則「點頭」，繼則「搖頭」，終至「叩頭」（如不叩頭恐將殺頭）而後已。是則共黨在各地的行爲，還是不脫先誘騙後成脅的手段，而在所謂「解放區」的人民並沒有「解放他們的痛苦，可想而知。我們以爲共黨與其用心用力向政府去爭地盤的大小，爭軍隊的多少，不如大　天悟，「放下屠刀，」向人民去爭同情，爭信仰。須知同情積得多，信仰積得久，政爭活可有獲勝的一天。若不從此根本點着想，祗知擁兵割據，必不能逃「逆天者亡」的命運。</p>
<p>總之，中國今天不許任何黨任何人來破壞統一，自毀勝利的果實。好在政治協商會議即將召開，共黨有什麼高見，儘可由其代表拿到會議裏去討論表決，萬不可再在會場上敷衍，戰塲上搗亂。西洋人常說，把牌攤到桌面上來。但願眞能愛國明理的共產黨人，也學學這些民主國家政黨的作風，立即下令停止各地襲擊國軍阻撓受降的軍事行動，一切問題聽候政治協議會議作公正的解決。中國前途的爲禍為福，共黨前途的爲得為失，全繫於此時共黨領袖與其信徒們的一念。</p>
<h3 id="c14">西子浮雕 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 徐昌霖</p>
<p>山外青山樓外樓　八年冤讎何時休</p>
<p>我自小生長在西子湖畔，二十餘年來沒有一日離開過她的培育，抗戰軍興，即轉輾入川，在異鄕蟄居的八年中，無日不在懷念湖山可能安然無恙吾。</p>
<p>這次隨着勝利的來臨，我來到了上海，沒有告訴任何朋友，我悄悄地一個人回故鄕探望了闊別八載的她。當我從迎紫路漸漸走近她的時候，我心頭的歡悅是難以形容的。</p>
<p>她依然是那樣的平靜，那樣的秀麗，那樣的明潔。可是誰料想到她曾經遭受過敵八年的蹂躪呢？</p>
<p>像一個極富涵養的聖女，縱然受了天天的屈辱，她的外表還是恬靜的。可是當你細心地和她相處下來，你會發現她那被損害與被侮辱過的內心是那麼凄楚呀！</p>
<p>下面便是我和她相處一週內我所聽到的她的傾訴：</p>
<p>昔日她那秀麗的裙邊——湖濱公園已是蕭條不堪，樹木多被斧砍，路燈上明亮整齊的奶油燈泡均不翼而飛，亂石雜草叢生。陳英士烈士像銹了，陣亡烈士紀念塔雖依舊英武地指向天空，但據舟子告訴我那烈士像曾在湖底埋藏了八年，代替它的是一隻「東亞和平」之鐘。自從最近鐵的現實粉碎了「東亞和平」之夢後，這才由國軍自己的手和人民的手把烈士的靈魂從海底拯救出來上，重立在光榮的寶座上。</p>
<p>昔日桃紅柳綠的「翠堤春曉」，桃樹已被砍光，所剩的柏樹亦皆斷臂折腰，「斷橋殘雪」事實上已成爲「斷瓦殘垣」。輝煌的博覽會大門和大橋均找不到影子，因之遊客已無法享受從孤山踱到西湖大禮堂的樂趣。</p>
<p>提到西湖大禮堂，眞是再令人傷心也沒有，除去門前的大理石級外，餘悉被日軍拆毀一空。</p>
<p>岳墳尚完好，「碧血丹心」的橫區在遊人眼前更形醒目。遺臭萬年的秦槍身上益破銹，週圍腥臭，昔日的漢奸在岳武穆忠魂前更羞愧得抬不起頭來。靈隱寺的精華羅漢殿已付之一炬，善男信女們已無法在五十羅漢前探知自己的命運。飛來峯上蟲　累累，一綫天內則蛛網滿佈。玉泉池魚已爲日軍槍殺甚多，「花港觀魚」亦無魚可觀。昔日香燭茂盛的天竺道上行人絕跡，寺僧亦稀少，獨多乞丐。</p>
<p>古木參天的理安寺，修竹夾道的雲棲，均剃成和尚尼姑頭，僅餘者皆雜樹敗草。九溪十八澗行人益稀，水道多淤塞。石屋洞水樂洞一帶道上蔓草絆足，可見八年來極少遊客足跡。三潭印月常年愛侶雙雙出沒之亭閣不復再見，唯院公墩湖心亭如然鶴立湖心</p>
<p>裏西湖與小南湖均爲水草阻塞，船須伐草而行。八年來敵軍封鎖裹西湖，蘇堤上之六橋（日：東坡橋，壓堤橋，望山橋，映波橋，跨虹橋，鎖瀾橋）下均置有機槍，行人偶一不愼，即遭槍殺。</p>
<p>至於湖上有名之莊子，如劉莊，在莊，蔣莊，康莊，不僅門窗板壁都拆去當柴燒，連莊內草地八年來爲敵馬所嚙，幼苗不復更生矣。</p>
<p>曼殊大師墳頭荆棘蓬蒿已一人餘高，「孤山一片心」「放鶴亭」門前亦可羅雀。</p>
<p>環顧西子，景物已全非，唯孤山財神殿內燈燭輝煌，煥然如新，殿內金元寶累累，蓋均八年來新貴所奉也。</p>
<p>與西子相處一週，每日聽到她如怨如泣的申訴，心如刀割，如今失地已收，湖山重光，但追想八年來蹂躪聖地佛國的敵寇奸僞，依舊逍遙法外，沒有受到應有的懲罰，我不禁要套一首舊詩：</p>

<h3 id="c48">大學教育宜推行三種辦法 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 黃河淸</p>
<p>頃讀胡先骕先生「政治改造與教育改造」一文，暢述中國現行敎育制度之缺點，議論頗多精闢，其對於各級學校所提出之改造方案，亦足供關心敎育者之檢討，非徒爲消極的批評者可比。茲就其有關大學敎育部分，酌予介紹。</p>
<p>胡先生對於大學敎育，以爲有三種辦法必須普遍推行：</p>
<p>（）一大學學生一般應分爲普通生與高材生。同一課程。若有高才生願意深造者，必須由敎授予以特別指導。在英美大學，除普通大學生外，尚有一部份選「名譽」課程者，其閱續研究之內容，及其評定分數之標準，皆遠較一般普通學生爲高；其畢業文憑上，特標出名譽字，如Cum　Laude與Magna　Cum　Lauo以資鼓勵。此種制度，收效極宏，如遇異常卓越之天，尤須由國家施以特殊之敎育。</p>
<p>（二）尚有「自由選課」一種，亦行於歐美大學，凡在合格之中學畢業，或年齡過大不須學位之人，皆可入大學自由選課。</p>
<p>（三）大學應辦函授或廣播等推廣敎育，以備因故不能入大學或不欲入大學者選習。並可斟酌情形，給予函授學生以畢業證書，爲其就業之助。蘇聯大學極力注意使工人能選修大學功課，以期大學敎育之能普及，我國大學亦宜仿效之。</p>
<p>按上述三種辦法，係採「自由敎育」制，第一種，可使智力優異俯就有餘之學生，充分獲得良師之指導，不致與仰企不足之平庸學生同其進退，而理沒其卓越天才。第二種，可使年齡較大之學生有進修之機會。第三種，則可給予因空間時間之限制而不得入大學者以肄業之便利。此等富有彈性之講習辦法，在中國古代之太學，與宋明以來之書院制度下，尚能造就不少名學者與政治領袖，有在今日之大學而能採用此等辦法，則較諸徒以畢業文憑爲進身之階，或在呆板之教室生活中，裨版呆板之智識，其收效之宏大，豈但倍蓰而已哉！</p>

<h3 id="c57">軍警憲打成一片　協力維持治安　保衛部團人數可達一萬 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>最近本市盜刦案不斷發生引起市民非常的焦慮，在這冬　期內的治安問題，實然是　非常重要的事。本報記者連日訪問軍憲警各機關，獲得了許多可以告慰讀者的消息，現在道如下：</p>
<p>戰後的上海，正和其他收復區城市一樣，由於大批留落在民間的槍械，以及憲兵散勇們的活躍，隨時可以來破壞治安，搗亂治安。當然，失業人數的增加，和物價的不能抑平，也能同接影營到治安。</p>
<p>淞滬警備司令部是　責維持本市治安的最高機關，經過連日與　　警有關各方會商後，已經決　進行的步驟。據李副司令告記者說：「我們不但要使市區安寗，同時對市區四　也要使它安寗。我們爲加强力量，決定將新成立的　總團配合起來。我相信這個力量足够應付一切。至於民間的槍械，凡正當用作保衛的，可以給照。如果故意　　，一經搜出，當以軍法治罪，希望新聞界在與諭上督促市民，從速到警察局去辦理登記。末後，李氏還告訴記者，本部已組織了一個軍憲警會合的巡察隊，現分五區，每日夜分班出巡。凡遇見行跡可疑，或制服不正的軍人，隨時加人盤問檢查或拘捕。」</p>
<p>憲兵二十三團沈團長萬千告記者謂：「本團當依照警備司令部所定的範圍內，盡力協助維持治安。惟本人希望，治本尤重於治標，不過在目前，這種工作的確很兩難。」</p>
<p>雖然，盜刦案時有發生，但警察局破獲的也很多，而且相當迅速。惟爲便於當局偵查起見，這裏却不便發表。最近警局已在加緊健全保甲組織，全市　分三十三區，對於敵僞佔領期間，以及最近的戶口，將予一次大淸查。記者相信，這種淸查工作，對於治安上有莫大的幫助哩。</p>
<p>這裏，記者再來介紹新近成立的保衛總團。現任總團長容有略氏，是苦守衛陽四十六天的名將。該團自經上海市保衛委員會籌備成立後，分爲常備團員與義務團員兩種。義務團員以戰前舊有的保衛團員，和前租界的商團團員，加以調查審核後入團的，現在已有二三千人。至本月底和常備的合起來，大約可有一萬人。但他們完全是人民自衛團體，任務僅爲協助軍警維持地方治安。</p>
<p>最後附帶報告，市區四郊同胞的一個喜訊，浙滬警備司令部已開始會同駐軍，開到你們那裏來了。「L」</p>
<h3 id="c58">二千餘男女離滬　首批日僑昨返國　明優丸約於月半再行駛滬 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>首批返國日僑計二千一百八十五名，已於前日在滬江大學集中，實施檢查完畢，於昨晨八時起，開始登明優丸返日。凡大件行李及婦孺病弱，均先以卡車運至虬江碼頭，其餘均步行，並有我憲兵導率前行，直至正午十二時許始行竣事。日僑管理處王兼處長·鄒副處長，均登輪巡視，虬江碼頭之男女日僑，　集一處，大件行李則用起貨機運吊船艙，男女日僑分自明傷丸之前後輪梯而上。輪上之美軍及日籍船員，對於上輪負重之婦孺輩，咸多撫扶。又中宣部對日文化宣傳工作委員會，特印製大批宣傳品，上輪散發及撫慰。第三方面軍湯司令官，曁日僑管理處王兼處長，亦散發告歸國日僑書。該批日僑登輪完畢，明優丸當於下午一時半，啓椗東駛。該輪約本月十六日左右，再行駛滬。</p>
<p>鄒副處長視察集中區日戰俘</p>
<p>本市日僑管理處，自奉命兼辦京滬區戰俘後，昨日下午二時，王兼處長特派由該處鄒副處長任之，前赴江灣路日俘集中區松井本部視察，當由日司令松井中將，參謀長土居中將迎迓。鄒民對於京滬綫戰俘集中情形，垂詢頗詳，同時對於集中戰俘敎育問題，指示甚多。又據土居報告，刻該部奉中國政府命令，嚴防士兵逃亡，故各集中營仍維持原有編制，階級管制，復諸求對於該部原有之數百幃國士兵，請予分別管理云云。茲悉，我日僑管理處，已決於日內召集京滬綫戰俘之原有部隊長訓話，並頒發管制方案，指派人員負責管理云。</p>
<p>湯司令官訓詞大意</p>
<p>湯司令官昨晨出席日僑自治會，對行將陸續返國之日僑致訓詞，略謂：過去八年來，自蘆溝橋事變起，迄日人投降止，吾人所遭受之痛苦，決非日人所能想像。所謂「大東亞共存共榮」之錯誤思想，應予澈底纠正。今後當以眞理信義仁愛和平，共維世界和平。」</p>
<p>首批遣歸之日僑二千餘，昨日肩荷行李，排隊登輪出發。</p>

<h3 id="c77">門外談畫 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 張十方</p>
<p>自己雖然不是繪畫的門內漢，可是正和一般有知識的人們一樣，對於看畫郤頗感興味，尤其是對於漫畫，隨着人世的滑格的增加，早在幾許年前，已經深切的愛好着了。其後，得到了常常觀覽歐美漫畫家們的作品的機會，更加深切地認識那是對黑暗銳利的標槍，乃由趣味的愛好進而發展爲一種對於正義武器的崇視了。</p>
<p>我認爲在抗戰的過程中，漫畫之所以未能發揮其力量，却不僅是山於漫畫家的技術與學識的修養不够，還有就是漫畫家對於自己的工作粗製濫造與乎技術上的偷懶取巧。</p>
<p>從許多的沒畫中發現了最大的缺點，例如畫幅上所畫的人，實在無法使人無法使自己能够稱它們爲「人」，——甚至畫面上一頭牛或狗，也會使人無法辨認其爲「牛」爲「狗」。因爲那些人的腦袋，往往是橫置在所謂頸項上的長方形，而兩手則類似兩根木頭一般直直的。這是那一類的藝術呢？我想該是A　drawing　by　a　child了吧。</p>
<p>對這一類的漫畫，有時會使人感到一陣惡心，一些朋友們談論到我國漫畫時，也往往指出這一個缺點，我想漫畫家絕不是沒有能力畫人像人，但却偏要隨意濫造，也許是以爲標奇立異，可是給讀者的印象，除惡劣外，還有什麼呢？再加上作一幅漫畫時不肯多下一點思考工夫，而造成了刻板與千遍一律。遂造成了還在嫩弱中的漫畫一個致命傷。</p>
<p>為希望它不單不會夭折，且將從此茁壯起來，我要寫出對漫畫作者的兩點門外意見了。</p>
<p>（一）要畫人像人，退一步說，也總得畫一個人不致與人譜離得太遠呀，這是有待於漫畫作者技術上的刻苦修養以及隨意濫造的惡習的揚棄。</p>
<p>（二）要多用思考，對構圖上，命意上，題材上多思考一下，漫畫是一種需要多多參攙上深湛的含意的藝術品。這不能不有待於漫畫家對於繪畫以外的各種學識的修養了。</p>
<p>最後，不宜一點是需要特別提出的，漫畫稿費的低賤，該是一個使漫畫作者不能不粗製濫造的主要客觀原因吧，如何使漫畫家費一兩個星期乃至一兩個月所完成的作品的報酬，足可以維持一兩星期乃至一兩月的生活，這却是我所要爲漫畫家高聲呼籲的。</p>
<p>時代又轉變了，同時我們也很關心今後漫畫家的筆鋒的方向，也許有人覺得這方向是很難選擇的，但是有一句話我想依然可以適用的，便是「國家第一」，「人民第一」，我們一切的文化工作者能守住這兩句話，我們「筆鋒」乃至「談鋒」的方向是不會錯誤的。</p>

<h3 id="c78">辯「枵腹從公」 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 史東山</p>
<p>××兄：你的意見我看了，大體很贊同；祗是關於「公務人員即在此物價之下，亦不應計較待遇」，這一點的「說敎」，我不同意。「枵腹」是不可能「從公」的，譬如像我這樣的負擔—三個中學程度的兒子必須續書，一個剛斷奶的小女兒，一個寄養在遠處的大女兒，每月拿逍麼一點錢，怎麼够？差得太遠了。你想把人的心脫離了物質關係，硬從好的方面拉，但另一方面，有一種實際的力量把人心拉回來，你是無可抵抗的。所以賢明的作家決不與自然硬鬥，幸而這一點不是你作品的主題，看完後，讀者也便忘了，不然，你一定會受到咀咒。</p>
<p>我以爲除了主觀上不健全的人確是該死之外，任何人逃不掉客觀的物質環境的影響。任何學派的心理學家不得不承認「刺戟　知覺—思想（或情緒，情感）」的公式。</p>
<p>我的意見也許不對，因爲我剛才喝了很多酒，有點激動。</p>

<p>十年持漢節，出使來遠方，歸心付落日，愁思寄牧羊，北海寒風緊；天山積雪颺，山海隔中州，悠悠不能忘！牴羊失其毛，毛脫還復長，節旄日以凋，零落我心傷。牴羊離其羣，暗暗訴衷腸，誰悲失路者，四顧我徬徨，皎皎明月夜，俛仰自蒼茫，不見江漢流，但見浮雲翔。四時更變化，兩鬢添新霜，愴懷思故國，何日見君王？年年守漢節，迢迢在遠方—落日歸心絕，牧羊邊地荒。渴飲冰屑寒；饑餐雪花凉，飄零何時已？涕淚沾衣裳！</p>

<p>編者：女作家白薇的消息，諒來必被上海人士所注意，的確，她跟冰心冰瑩一樣地有多少年不跟上海人士見面了，只少是她們的作品，冰瑩現在已出川，在漢口編和平日報副刋，冰心還住在重慶，白薇呢，實際上這多年來連重慶的人也不十分明白牠的景况，這是一個不幸，何以連重慶的人也不跟她親近的我十分相信，她是樸素眞質的，祗是她的作品，在這幾年中少了一些，大家彷彿不注意了，也有不明白她的人，對她有些誤解，可是白薇，這位作家，像此花似的人物，我是喜歡的。</p>
<p>也是爲了落寞的緣故，她的生活，確乎比其他女作家更窮，我無法形容她，將來她終會有個自傳，詳細的告訴世人，只有一句話可以報告傢　便是她雖窮，傲骨却比高喊口號的那些作家眞賣得多所以有什麼作家救濟金一類的施予，她一槪拒絕了，有一次她還忿慨地當衆撕碎過一張五千元的支票。白薇，我是喜歡她的！</p>

<p>— 吳仞之</p>
<p>古昔詩人好作洒脫語。世人喜風雅，竟誤以爲風雅者必洒脫。於是洒脫毒人，旣深且甚。年來此風稍戢，然偶因愛好辭藻，引用典據，輙不免落入此套中而不自覺察。常見貼照簿題名錄之類，封面題有「雪泥鴻爪」者，即其一例。</p>
<p>東坡詩：「人生到處知何似，應是飛鴻踏雪泥。泥上偶然留爪跡，鴻飛那復計東西？」</p>
<p>「雪泥鴻爪」之由來，原本於此。此詩瀟洒淸麗，人多愛咏，然細味語意，其處世之不負責任，竟於「偶然那復」之辭氣中充分表現無遺！假若評日「毒盡蒼生，『誰日不宣？」</p>
<p>或曰，日前倉庫怪火二起，亦「鴻爪」精神之大表現也。余不禁憬然默頷之。然而細加覆按，則又不然。「鴻爪」主義之輩，是洒脫而不負責任。而負責倉庫者，是死啃着而又不負責任。或稱之曰『超鴻爪主義者』，其庶幾乎！</p>
<p>「超鴻爪主義者」，滔滔皆是，故曰「毒盡蒼生」。而受其害者，千百萬市民，故又曰「害盡蒼生」，嗚呼蒼生，其將無噍類乎！</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 4th] Chinese aviation personnel, making their first flight over the Northeast, landed a C-46 American aircraft at Jinzhou Airport today, carrying two and a half tons of ammunition for Du Yuming's rapid deployment forces. It is reported that these rapid deployment forces arrived today at Panshan, 75 li south of Goubangzi. Reports indicate that more planes, flown by Chinese personnel, will successively arrive in Jinzhou. Vice Admiral Barbey, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, concluded two days of discussions in Jinzhou with Chinese government leaders yesterday and has returned to Huludao. It is rumored that the discussions concerned the continued advancement of the National Army into North China and the Northeast. Chinese newspapers report that one route of the National Army has reached Panshan, between Goubangzi and the Yingkou railway, and another has reached Beizhen, 69 li northeast of Goubangzi. The National Army, having occupied Dahushan, is reportedly advancing eastward in two routes, one rapidly heading towards Xinmin, 129 li northwest of Dahushan, and the other advancing towards Liaozhong, 144 li southwest of Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jinzhou, 4th] Northeast Security Commander General Du Yuming announced today that eleven Curtis transport planes, flown by Chinese pilots, arrived yesterday carrying over 20 tons of supplies. With the air support, the National Army's morale is greatly boosted. The vanguard of the National Army has broken through to within 90 li of Shenyang, while the main forces are 390 li away. However, according to Du, the National Army will not immediately enter Shenyang until the Soviet forces have completed the occupation negotiations or confirmed their withdrawal, and only after the Communist forces within the city have been eliminated.</p>
<p>[Additional Dispatch] Yesterday, the National Army suddenly launched a surprise attack on insurgents at the nearby airport, seizing seventy airplanes previously held by the Japanese. At the time, the aircraft were in a state of readiness, as the Communists intended to utilize them, and the National Army launched a sudden attack. Meanwhile, according to news from Harbin, the Chinese Communist forces still possess more aircraft and are planning to use them to attack General Du Yuming's forces. Du's forces continue to receive reinforcements from the National Army landing at Qinhuangdao, but they lack air power. When reporters inquired about this, Du replied, "Why use a butcher knife to kill a chicken? The current battle is like killing a chicken; there's no need for a butcher knife."</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 4th] Shi Zhiren, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Transportation for the Beiping-Tianjin Area, recently returned from an inspection of Shanhaiguan and reported that the National Army is advancing smoothly towards Shenyang along the Beining Railway. Passenger and freight transport between Qinhuangdao and Jinzhou, 300 li north of Shanhaiguan, has been fully restored. However, due to a shortage of tires, there is only one round trip per day for the time being.</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] The British construction of a large-scale airport in Kowloon has aroused great concern among Chinese circles here. Semi-official Chinese sources indicate that modernized long-range bombers based at the airport would be able to fly to any location in China. According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese government, in light of the "end of the war," is currently "advising" Britain to abandon this project. According to well-informed sources, Chinese landlords in Kowloon have repeatedly clashed with British Royal Air Force officials over the British plans to requisition their land for the construction of the airport. Some believe that the construction of this airport may prompt China to promptly demand that Britain return the leased territory of Kowloon.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] A responsible person from the Textile Industry Management Committee stated: The current task of the Committee is to directly manage and take over enemy and puppet cotton yarn, American wool, silk, and textile businesses. As for the takeover of enemy and puppet factories, it is planned to hand over some of them to private management, but a transitional period is required, as the work of pricing machinery and conducting technical reviews is quite time-consuming. It is also learned that there were 57 textile factories during the war, 32 large-scale and 25 small-scale, with a total of 270,000 spindles. Full operation could produce 182,000 bales of cotton yarn annually, with monthly output of over 10,000 bales. During the war, due to a shortage of raw materials, only 140,000 spindles were in operation. Currently, the furnace system has been liberated, but the use of costs is too high, and there is no sign of improvement.</p>

All legitimate taxes will be paid as usual, and it will not monopolize various raw materials. If it is necessary to negotiate prices, an evaluation committee will be formed, inviting private enterprises to participate in the negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Editorial: An Advice to the Chinese Communist Party <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department told a Reuters reporter, "The Communist Party has the intention of dividing China into two." At first glance, we seem unable to believe it, yet we cannot help but believe it. As the declaration of sixteen cultural groups in Chongqing rightly states, construction comes first, nation-building comes first; support unification, oppose division. We believe that as long as someone is Chinese, they would all desire this. Moreover, the Communist Party often calls for democracy, peace, and unity, so to say that they intend to divide the hard-won victory of China into two seems contrary to human nature. However, observing the Communist Party's military actions in recent years, especially in recent months, and inferring from the talk of Communist Army Chief of Staff Ye Jianying preparing for ten years of war, what Minister Wu has surmised may not be entirely unfounded. The country belongs to everyone, jointly owned by the people; it is neither the exclusive possession of the Kuomintang alone, nor is it for the Communist Party alone to divide. At this critical juncture, we wish to stand in the position of the press and offer a few words of advice to the Chinese Communist Party on behalf of the people with complete goodwill.</p>
<p>First, political parties can have political disputes, but they must not have military disputes. This is the common practice of democratic countries. Moreover, China needs to grow in the cradle of democracy, and the people after the war yearn for rest and recuperation. At this time, the first priority of any political party is nothing more than how to enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, abandoning peaceful political disputes and embracing armed rebellion, no matter how many good-sounding terms are used, will never win the support of the people. The Communist Party's style in Jiangxi before the war and the remnants of their 25,000-li flight have made the people turn pale at the mention of "Communism." It was not easy for the opportunity to resist Japan to arrive, and the Communist Party voluntarily united to resist the enemy. The government was also able to be magnanimous. During the eight years, although there were inevitably some frictions, they were able to barely tolerate each other for the sake of the country because of the great enemy at hand. The Communist Party also somewhat regretted its past mistakes, loudly proclaiming "the Sinicization of Marxism-Leninism," and striving to win the sympathy of the Chinese people in terms of political measures and ideological propaganda. We, the people, originally had no prejudices. From the people coming and going from Yan'an, we also somewhat acknowledged that the Communist Party had some vitality and some new methods, and therefore pinned our hopes on it. For the Communist Party's sake, the victory of the war against Japan was a great opportunity for them to win national sympathy. The Kuomintang had already announced the abolition of party branches in the military as a preliminary implementation of the nationalization of the military. The Communist Party should have seized this opportunity to release its military power and return the army to the country. Arguing about how many divisions to reorganize already seems narrow-minded. Moreover, the previously agreed upon Three-Man Committee to study the reorganization of the Communist army was delayed for months due to Mr. Ye Jianying's late arrival, achieving nothing. How will they explain this to the people? The Communist Party abandons its strengths in political disputes and prefers to use its weaknesses in military disputes, so that even if the people had some sympathy for the Communist Party in the past few years, they will now lose it all. This is most regrettable. It must be known that the Chinese people, on the surface, are the most gentle and powerless, but in reality, their sense of right and wrong is the strongest and most powerful. We, the common people, have always been generous and can forgive other disputes between political parties, but we will certainly consider those who willingly undermine unification and divide China as public enemies of the people and criminals of the country. Mao Zedong may have understood this intention of the people during his stay in Chongqing, so he loudly called for supporting the National Government and supporting Chairman Chiang. But why, as soon as he returned to Yan'an, did the Communist army everywhere obstruct the National Government from sending troops to accept the surrender, and everywhere obstruct the implementation of Chairman Chiang's orders? Such acts of separatist rebellion do not seem like something done by a large political party that wishes to build a democratic China, and it will never gain the widespread and sincere love of the general public. Therefore, even if not for the sake of the country, but only for the sake of the Communist Party, the Communist Party should change its course, hand over military power, abandon military disputes, and devote itself to competing with the Kuomintang in ideological propaganda and political measures. Only then can it have a future. Otherwise, the Communist Party will isolate itself from the people!</p>
<p>Second, a government cannot stand without the trust of the people. Whether in ancient times or today, whether in China or abroad, in order to accomplish something in the position of government, one must first gain the belief of the people. This is true when a political party is in power, and it is no less true when it is in opposition. "Even thieves have a code of conduct," let alone a political party? The value of a political party should not be judged solely by whether it is in power. Those in power are not necessarily all right; those out of power are not necessarily all wrong. If those in power can fulfill their duties in power, and those out of power can fulfill their responsibilities of oversight, then political governance will be enlightened, and they will complement each other. Therefore, from the perspective of the Chinese people today, it would be better for the Communist Party to temporarily settle in opposition and exercise fair and impartial oversight, rather than insist on jumping onto the stage and joining the ranks of those in power. This would benefit the country and be welcomed by the people. If, because of not having a share in power and failing to compete for it, they resort to taking risks, raising troops and making trouble, then that is a re-enactment of the old drama of warlords splitting the country in Chinese history, and not a new style of political parties in modern democratic countries. This is truly the worst strategy. Moreover, for a political party to gain the trust of the people, it is most important to honor its political promises. It is difficult for the people to see through whether the blank checks issued when a party is in opposition will be cashed in the future, so it is easier for an opposition party to develop than a ruling party. Today, the Communist Party in China happens to be taking advantage of this. Unfortunately, the Communist Party does not know how to take advantage of the situation and first establish its own credibility. The Communist Party today is issuing checks on the one hand and bouncing them on the other. The more bad checks, the more the people will suspect and dislike it. The Communist Party clamors every day that the National Army is launching a civil war and that they are liberating the people. But the people are not all simpletons, and the eyes and ears of the world cannot be covered by one hand. Who is obstructing the orders of the Supreme Commander? Who is attacking the National Army that is ordered to accept the surrender? Who is attacking the National Army and seizing cities and towns everywhere throughout the country, from eastern Guangdong in the south to Suiyuan and Chahar in the north? As General Fu Zuoyi said, who is hitting whom and who is being hit can be easily discerned on a map. The Communist Party denies that it is an armed political party on the one hand, but on the other hand, it demands the expansion of armed forces in every negotiation, and calls it the army of the people. The Communist Party shouts loudly against civil war on the one hand, but on the other hand, its chief of staff publicly declares that it is preparing for ten years of war. How can this gain the trust of the people? It has been said that the elders in Jiangnan tell a joke that the Communist Party and the Communist Army have so-called "three things" wherever they go, that is, the people initially "nod their heads," then "shake their heads," and finally "kowtow" (or they may be killed if they don't kowtow). Therefore, the actions of the Communist Party in various places are still inseparable from the means of first inducing and then coercing. It is not difficult to imagine that the people in the so-called "liberated areas" have not been "liberated" from their suffering. We believe that instead of using their minds and efforts to compete with the government for the size of territory and the number of troops, the Communist Party should suddenly wake up, "lay down the butcher knife," and compete with the people for sympathy and belief. It must be known that if sympathy accumulates, and belief lasts for a long time, then the day of winning a political dispute may come. If one does not think from this fundamental point, and only knows how to occupy territory with troops, one will inevitably not escape the fate of "those who go against Heaven perish."</p>
<p>In short, China today does not allow any party or any person to undermine unification and destroy the fruits of victory. Fortunately, the Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened. Whatever brilliant ideas the Communist Party has, it can be taken to the conference by its representatives for discussion and voting. It must not be perfunctory at the conference and cause trouble on the battlefield. Westerners often say, "Put your cards on the table." We hope that truly patriotic and reasonable Communists will also learn from the style of political parties in these democratic countries, and immediately order a halt to military operations in various places that attack the National Army and obstruct the surrender. All issues will be left to the Political Consultative Conference for a fair resolution. Whether the future of China is a blessing or a curse, and whether the future of the Communist Party is a gain or a loss, all depends on the thoughts of the Communist Party leaders and their followers at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Western Lake Sculpture <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Changlin</p>
<p>Beyond the mountains, green mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings.</p>
<p>When will the hatred of eight years be over?</p>
<p>I grew up by the West Lake since I was little. For over twenty years, I have never left her nurturing. When the War of Resistance broke out, I moved to Sichuan. During the eight years of living in a foreign land, I missed the lake and mountains every day, hoping they were safe and sound.</p>
<p>This time, with the arrival of victory, I came to Shanghai. Without telling any friends, I quietly returned to my hometown alone to visit her after eight years of separation. As I gradually approached her from Yingzi Road, the joy in my heart was beyond description.</p>
<p>She was still so calm, so beautiful, and so bright. But who would have thought that she had suffered eight years of enemy trampling?</p>
<p>Like a highly cultivated saint, even if she suffered humiliation every day, her appearance was still serene. But when you get along with her carefully, you will find that her damaged and insulted heart is so sad!</p>
<p>The following is what I heard from her during a week of being with her:</p>
<p>In the past, her beautiful skirt hem—the Lakeside Park—is now desolate. Many trees have been chopped down, and the bright and tidy cream-colored light bulbs on the street lamps have disappeared. There are overgrown rocks and weeds. The statue of Martyr Chen Yingshi is rusty. Although the Martyrs' Memorial Tower still points heroically to the sky, the boatmen told me that the statue of the martyr had been buried at the bottom of the lake for eight years, replaced by a "East Asia Peace" bell. Since the recent iron reality shattered the dream of "East Asia Peace," the souls of the martyrs were rescued from the seabed by the hands of the National Army and the hands of the people, and re-established on the glorious throne.</p>
<p>In the past, the "Emerald Embankment in Spring Dawn," with its red peach blossoms and green willows, has had all its peach trees cut down. The remaining cypress trees are also broken and bent. "Broken Bridge with Lingering Snow" has actually become "Broken Tiles and Broken Walls." The magnificent gates and bridges of the Expo are nowhere to be found, so tourists can no longer enjoy the pleasure of strolling from Gushan to the West Lake Auditorium.</p>
<p>Speaking of the West Lake Auditorium, it is really sad. Except for the marble steps in front of the door, everything else was demolished by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Yue Fei's tomb is still intact, and the horizontal plaque of "Loyalty and Patriotism" is even more striking in front of tourists. The body of Qin Hui, who will be infamous for ten thousand years, is even more broken and rusty, and the surroundings are stinky. The traitors of the past are even more ashamed to raise their heads in front of the loyal soul of Yue Wu Mu. The essence of Lingyin Temple, the Arhat Hall, has been reduced to ashes. Pious men and women can no longer explore their fate in front of the fifty Arhats. The insects on Feilai Peak are piled up, and the One-Line Sky is full of spider webs. The fish in Yuquan Pond have been shot and killed by the Japanese army, so there are no fish to watch at "Flower Harbor Viewing Fish." On the Tianzhu Road, which used to be full of incense candles, pedestrians are rare, and there are few monks in the temple, but many beggars.</p>
<p>The ancient trees towering into the sky in the Li'an Temple, and the bamboo-lined Yunqi, have all been shaved into monks' and nuns' heads. Only miscellaneous trees and weeds remain. Pedestrians are even more rare in Jiuxi and Eighteen Streams, and the waterways are mostly silted up. Weeds entangle the feet on the roads in the Shiwu Cave and Water Music Cave areas, which shows that very few tourists have visited in the past eight years. The pavilions where lovers used to come and go in Santanyinyue are no longer visible, only the Gongyuan Mound and Huxin Pavilion stand alone in the heart of the lake.</p>
<p>The Inner West Lake and Xiaonan Lake are blocked by weeds, and boats have to cut grass to move forward. For eight years, the enemy army has blockaded the Inner West Lake, and machine guns have been placed under the six bridges on Su Causeway (namely: Dongpo Bridge, Yadi Bridge, Wangshan Bridge, Yingbo Bridge, Kuahong Bridge, and Suolan Bridge). Pedestrians are occasionally shot and killed if they are not careful.</p>
<p>As for the famous villas on the lake, such as Liu Zhuang, in Zhuang, Jiang Zhuang, and Kang Zhuang, not only were the doors, windows, and walls removed and burned as firewood, but even the lawns in the villas have been gnawed by enemy horses for eight years, and seedlings can no longer be regenerated.</p>
<p>The thorns and weeds on the tomb of Master Manshu are taller than a person. There are few visitors in front of "A Heart on Lonely Hill" and "Releasing Crane Pavilion."</p>
<p>Looking around the West Lake, the scenery is completely different. Only the lights and candles in the Wealth God Hall on Gushan are shining brightly, completely renewed. The gold ingots in the hall are piled up, all of which have been offered by the new dignitaries in the past eight years.</p>
<p>Spending a week with the West Lake, I heard her mournful complaints every day, and my heart was cut like a knife. Now that the lost land has been recovered and the lake and mountains have regained their glory, but when I think of the enemy bandits and traitors who ravaged the holy land and Buddhist kingdom for eight years, they are still at large and have not received due punishment. I cannot help but quote an old poem:</p>
<p>Saying:——</p>
<p>"Beyond the mountains, green mountains; beyond the buildings, more buildings.</p>
<p>When will the hatred of eight years be over?"</p>

Deputy Chief of Staff Cai Wenji, Secretary Zeng Hongtu, and others came with him. After He got off the plane, he made the following statement: I went to Chongqing last month to attend the restoration and reorganization meeting. Because I was in charge of various matters in the Chief of Staff's office, I stayed in Chongqing for a while. The main purpose of this restoration and reorganization meeting is to gradually restore and substantially enrich the national army, so as to become a modern army. Now that various principles have been decided, they can be gradually implemented. Regarding the return to the capital, the official date of the return has not been determined. In order to meet the actual needs, it is heard that various departments of the Executive Yuan will first send a part of their personnel to Nanjing for office work. Most of the Ministry of Military Affairs will move to Nanjing within this year. Regarding the restoration of national security and order, the most important task is to restore transportation. Now, plans have been drawn up and are being actively implemented for the repair and strengthening of railways, highways, ships, and aircraft transportation, such as the preparation of railway materials, automobile fuel, spare parts, and ships and aircraft. It is expected that most of the transportation can return to normal in a few months.</p>
<h3 id="e16">United University Grenade Case Tried in Kunming Yesterday; Lu Han Presides Over the Trial <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 4th] The criminal who threw a grenade at United University on the 1st of this month was publicly tried at the Garrison Headquarters at 3:00 p.m. on the 4th.

The results of the trial are recorded as follows: (1) The conflict between the Second Military Officers' Corps students and the students was caused by the fact that the students of the Corps were either insulted by the students in Kunming City, or were attacked by the students in the courtyard with tiles when they passed by United University while visiting Daguanlou, which caused indignation. (2) In the grenade incident at the College of Liberal Arts of United University, it was found that the hand grenade was thrown from inside the college, injuring one student of the Military Officers' Corps. (3) The part of the throwing of hand grenades at the Teachers College of United University was done by Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi. The two criminals Chen and Liu both admitted that throwing the grenades was not a violation. Both of them were unemployed soldiers. Chen Qida confessed that he was induced by the communist Jiang Kai with money and official positions, and was given hand grenades to follow his command. Liu Youzhi confessed that he was lured by Chen Qida. Another Chen Yunlou was also an unemployed soldier and was also bewitched. He also went with grenades on the day of the incident, but he held them in his hand and did not throw them. The inside story of this case has been fully investigated.</p>

<h3 id="e19">US Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Hold Meeting Today to Publicly Hear Important Report from Hurley; Thorough Investigation of State Department Personnel to Be Conducted <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee decided to hold a public meeting on Wednesday to hear evidence from former US Ambassador to China Patrick Hurley on the attacks on US career diplomacy. It is expected that Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson will also attend. According to the committee, after Hurley presents his evidence, if necessary, the new US Ambassador to China, General of the Army George Marshall, may also be invited to present evidence. Afterwards, Hurley will also attend a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] US Senator H. Alexander Smith said that before General of the Army George Marshall goes to China to take office, he may be asked to announce in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee what he intends to do in China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] US Representative Karl Mundt, a member of the US Congressional Committee to Investigate Actions Against US Interests, said that after hearing Hurley's report, the committee will begin a full and comprehensive investigation of the State Department. The method of investigation will depend on what Hurley tells us about the situation of the communists in the diplomatic community. We want to know who Hurley is accusing, and we especially want to know how these people are undermining our foreign policy and what methods they are using. Mundt personally believes that the saboteurs of foreign policy (pro-communist personnel) may be lurking among the lower-level personnel of the State Department. We suspect that these pro-communist diplomats are intentionally changing the reports sent from overseas before submitting them to higher-level personnel. Mundt said at the end that the reports that General of the Army George Marshall previously sent from China had apparently experienced the above situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Kansas City, 3rd] Former Commander of the US Air Force in the China Theater, Major General Claire Chennault, said today that the matter of former Ambassador to China Patrick Hurley's accusation that permanent diplomatic officials were obstructing US foreign policy should be thoroughly investigated. When asked whether General of the Army George Marshall's appointment as special envoy to China could make China unified and prosperous, Chennault replied, "The most capable people have done their best on this issue, but they have failed."</p>

<p>[United Press, Manila, 4th] The military activity off the coast of the Philippines proves that the United States does not want to fall into a state of unpreparedness again, at least in the Philippines. Although the naval plan is still secret, discerning people can see that a series of bases stretching 60,000 miles from California across the Pacific to the Asian border are being deployed. Commander Cothron, Commander of the Philippine Sea Defense, agrees to discuss the elimination of countless smaller bases, but the Naval Engineering Corps is expanding other bases. The Navy has relocated the entire city of Olongapo to a new location in Subic Bay on the northern tip of the Bataan Peninsula. Naval equipment and engineering in Lingayen Gulf and San Fernando have also begun. The largest naval facility in the Philippines is said to control the two main routes through the Gulf from Tagantaban to the central Philippines. How the former Japanese naval bases Davao and Cebu will be used has not yet been revealed.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 4th] The government of Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi is in a precarious situation under the pressure of internal and external affairs. It is learned that Prime Minister Hakimi intends to hold separate negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Soviet Union's requests for concessions to oil exploration rights, the dismissal of anti-Soviet cabinet members, and the expulsion of anti-Soviet political party leaders. Senior political figures believe that if these demands are implemented one by one, it will be a major victory for Soviet diplomacy, and British and American diplomacy will inevitably be humiliated.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The US State Department announced that the Soviet Union has rejected the US proposal for the complete withdrawal of Allied forces from Iran two months ago. However, the Soviet response stated that it would fulfill the guarantee it made in the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty, which stipulates that the deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Iran is March 2 of next year. According to well-informed sources here, Tehran hopes that the troops sent to northern Iran will not exceed 1,000, and even if the original 6,000 troops stationed in northern Iran are included, it will be no more than 7,000. Moreover, the former Soviet troops stationed there numbered about 30,000, and this small number does not seem to be a sufficient reason for the Soviet Union to increase troops to northern Iran.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] British policy on India will be announced this afternoon by Lord President of the Council Herbert Morrison and Secretary of State for India Lord Pethick-Lawrence in both the upper and lower houses of Parliament, respectively. It is expected that what will be announced this time is not a new policy, but a statement of existing policy. However, it will state what steps are planned to be taken after the elections in India in order to advance constitutional issues. No one has yet suggested a debate on the Indian issue. However, after the government releases its policy today, questions may still be raised. If the public wishes to submit the matter to debate, the government will also consider it. Political figures expect that the government will recommend sending a delegation of representatives from various parties in Parliament to India for inspection, possibly during the Indian elections.</p>

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 3rd] Joseph Keenan, the US chief prosecutor for the trial of Japanese war criminals, is scheduled to fly to Tokyo today with 22 prosecutors and 18 clerks. Keenan will divide Japanese war criminals into the following three categories: (1) Those responsible for launching the Pacific and China wars. (2) Those responsible for military crimes in violation of the rules of war. (3) Those responsible for the abuse of prisoners of war. According to Keenan, the initiation of the war began with the attack on Pearl Harbor, US territory, so the war criminals will be tried in accordance with US criminal law.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Former Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Forces Mutaguchi Renya told United Press reporters today: "During my tenure as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, I was responsible for all combat situations.

But what can be said is that if the Tojo cabinet bears responsibility for the Pacific War, then the Konoe cabinet must bear responsibility for the China Incident. The China Incident happened two weeks after I returned to Japan. I still regret it to this day. Japan fell into the quagmire at that time."</p>

O'Neill stated: "If this method succeeds, the amount of atomic energy obtained from light gas will be a thousand times greater than from other sources. Light gas is the raw material that sustains the incandescence of stars and the sun, and it is the most abundant substance in the universe."</p>
<p>Scientists hope to discover a method to completely convert light gas atoms into "energy." If one pound of transformed gas atoms is completely converted into energy, it can generate the equivalent of 113.5 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity.</p>
<p>"The method of transforming light gas into atomic energy seems to attract more attention than the method of extracting atomic energy from 'uranium.'"</p>
<p>Professor Wheeler of Princeton University, who actively participated in the "uranium" project, recently reviewed the problem of utilizing light gas. He believes that the key to converting all light gas material into energy lies in the protons in the atom. Protons are the core of light gas atoms, surrounded by a large number of electrons, but these electrons do not hinder the work of transforming matter into energy.</p>
<p>"Dr. Wheeler plans to use cosmic rays as a tool to break through the core of light gas. There is a particle in cosmic rays called 'meson.' 'Mesons' are emitted when a cosmic ray radiation (photon) impacts a proton. However, 'mesons' often disappear before reaching the ground, and the reason for their disappearance has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>"Cosmic rays that produce 'mesons' have a voltage of tens of millions of volts. According to Dr. Wheeler, this voltage is sufficient to transform matter into energy and more."</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Casualties in Surabaya are Numerous</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Surabaya, 1st (Special Telegram)] The deaths and injuries of innocent overseas Chinese in Surabaya due to the war are extremely numerous. This tragedy has now ended, and law and order have been restored. However, the Allied forces' power in other areas, such as Bandung and Semarang, is not uniform and are beyond reach, and similar losses will still occur. Two days before the Allied forces launched their offensive, most Dutch, Europeans, and some Indians and Arabs were evacuated by sea and air, but no overseas Chinese were evacuated. Around noon on November 9th, Allied aircraft dropped warning leaflets, which did not mention asking overseas Chinese to evacuate Surabaya. Neither side in the fighting suggested establishing a non-combatant safe zone. In the initial shelling by Allied forces in early June, overseas Chinese suffered heavy losses. After representatives of overseas Chinese explained the situation on November 15th, the Allied artillery fire gradually decreased.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Southwest Associated University News: Seeking Knowledge from a Miserable Environment; Preparing to Restore Schools After the End of the War <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] After the end of the war, the universities that moved inland are preparing to restore their schools and return to their old sites eight years ago. Some have already returned to their original locations. This ancient cultural country has unfortunately been devastated by the war, but the youth's spirit of seeking knowledge, despite hunger and poverty, is still maintained.</p>
<p>Joint Organization</p>
<p>Kunming Southwest Associated University was formed by the joint efforts of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University in Beiping. School affairs are managed through consultations between the presidents of the three universities. The president of Peking University is Hu Shi, the former ambassador to the United States. Mr. Hu is currently in London and is expected to return to China in March next year. Zhang Boling, the founder and president of Nankai University, is currently in Chongqing and serves as a senator. Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University, graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the United States.</p>
<p>Long Trek</p>
<p>These three universities moved inland in mid-summer of the 26th year. Thousands of students walked south along dusty highways, carrying only a few textbooks with them. In early October of that year, their first batch arrived in Changsha after walking more than 2,000 li, and a temporary school was established there. After three months, the Japanese army invaded, and they had to move again, and then trekked to Kunming. Another large number of professors and students went to Vietnam by detour. In August of the 27th year, they finally opened classes on the Kunming plateau and were no longer afraid of the Japanese army's invasion.</p>
<p>Simple School Buildings</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe the simplicity of the school buildings of the Associated University. Even today, the walls are still temporary and the ground is all dirt. Students disregard all kinds of difficulties and seek knowledge in such a miserable environment, which can be said to be unprecedented. However, the school still maintains extremely high standards. Those who come to study are all excellent children.</p>
<p>Will Return to Original Sites</p>
<p>The schools of the Associated University plan to return to their old sites in the spring or mid-summer of next year, respectively. During the war, they were occupied by the Japanese army and used as convalescent homes for wounded soldiers. Peking University was robbed by the enemy and puppets and renamed Peking University. The buildings of these two schools have not been damaged. However, the Nankai University school buildings in Tianjin have been completely destroyed by enemy aircraft. Currently, the most difficult thing for the schools is to re-purchase the instruments, equipment, and textbooks lost during the war. The central government will provide assistance in the form of loans or gifts.</p>

<p>[This City News] The educational and cultural institutions in the recovered area urgently need to be taken over and reorganized. It is learned that the Ministry of Education has decided to divide the country into six districts and establish educational restoration guidance committees to be responsible for handling the matter. This has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Jiang Fuzong has been appointed as the special commissioner of the Nanjing-Shanghai District Educational Restoration Guidance Committee, and Xu Bingkun, Zheng Zhenduo, Ma Xulun, Liu Guojun, Liu Shaozhong, Ye Fenghu, Zhou Junshi, and Xie Feng have been appointed as members to handle the takeover and restoration of educational and cultural institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other provinces and cities. Local military and political leaders in the guidance area will provide guidance and assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Municipal Education Association Rectification Committee Assists in Educational Restoration <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[This City News] The Shanghai Municipal Education Association Rectification Committee is actively carrying out the rectification of education associations in various districts. It will soon handle the registration of members and solicit new members, hoping to establish the municipal education association in the shortest possible time. It is learned that the association is also assisting the authorities in the city's restoration and is actively promoting the schools. Recently, it has also launched a loan movement to rescue out-of-school children. Recently, due to disputes over school buildings, the progress of educational restoration has been hindered. The association has led the way. For example, the private Mingde Girls' Middle School, whose school buildings were occupied by a traitorous Han traitor, has been ordered to move out by the bureau, but it has ignored the order. The association has investigated the truth and supported the authorities, requesting that the occupying traitors be brought to justice as soon as possible and ordered to move out of the school buildings so that the school can be restored as soon as possible and benefit the revival of education. As for the use of the school buildings of the Municipal Gezhi Middle School by the Health Bureau and the use of the school buildings of the Municipal North Middle School by the Central China Railway Management Committee, they have not been returned to this day, so that the school cannot be restored as soon as possible, and more than a thousand students have sacrificed their studies. At this time, when the country is just beginning to be built, education is the most important thing, and such a phenomenon should not occur. The association also pays great attention to this and hopes that the authorities will make proper arrangements as soon as possible to resolve it reasonably.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Three Methods Should be Implemented in University Education <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Heqing</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Hu Xiansu's "Political Transformation and Educational Transformation" article, which vividly describes the shortcomings of China's current education system. His arguments are very insightful, and the transformation plan he proposed for schools at all levels is also worthy of review by those who care about education, and is not comparable to those who are merely passive critics. Now, I will introduce his relevant parts of the university education.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu believes that there are three methods that must be universally implemented in university education:</p>
<p>(1) University students should generally be divided into ordinary students and high-achieving students. The same course. If high-achieving students are willing to study further, they must be given special guidance by professors. In British and American universities, in addition to ordinary university students, there are also some who choose "honor" courses. The content of their reading and research, and the standards for assessing their grades, are much higher than those of ordinary students. Their graduation diplomas are specially marked with honor words, such as Cum Laude and Magna Cum Lauo, to encourage them. This system is extremely effective. If there are unusually outstanding talents, the country must give them special education.</p>
<p>(2) There is also a "free elective" system, which is also practiced in European and American universities. Anyone who graduates from a qualified middle school, or who is too old to need a degree, can enter the university to freely select courses.</p>
<p>(3) Universities should run correspondence or broadcast education to prepare for those who cannot or do not want to enter the university due to various reasons. They can also consider giving correspondence students graduation certificates to help them find employment. Soviet universities pay great attention to enabling workers to take university courses in order to popularize university education. Universities in our country should also imitate this.</p>
<p>According to the above three methods, the "free education" system is adopted. The first method can enable students with superior intelligence to fully receive the guidance of good teachers, and will not be allowed to advance and retreat with mediocre students who are not satisfied, and bury their extraordinary talents. The second method can give older students the opportunity to study further. The third method can give those who cannot enter the university due to space and time constraints the convenience of studying. In the ancient Taixue and the academy system since the Song and Ming Dynasties in China, these flexible teaching methods were still able to cultivate many famous scholars and political leaders. If universities today can adopt these methods, then compared to merely using graduation diplomas as a stepping stone to advancement, or imparting rigid knowledge in a monotonous classroom life, the effectiveness will be more than doubled!</p>
<h3 id="e49">Property Forcibly Seized by the Enemy and Puppets Can Be Registered with the Handling Bureau for Return After Verification <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Since the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau began receiving and handling the property of the enemy, puppets, and German expatriates, a large number of people have come to register and apply for the return of their property. All property belonging to the enemy, puppets, and German expatriates will be confiscated entirely by the Handling Bureau. It is currently being sorted and categorized before being entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and fourteen other agencies for safekeeping and management. As for property belonging to citizens that was forcibly taken by the enemy and puppets, citizens can register with the Handling Bureau with evidence, and it will be returned after verification. However, the handling methods for real estate or other property that was forcibly purchased from citizens by the enemy and puppets are still under investigation. It will be determined whether to return the property or not based on a comparison between the market price of the property at the time and the selling price. If the whereabouts of items such as automobiles cannot be traced, citizens can register at the special office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, providing detailed information about the vehicle's engine and cylinder numbers to identify the current owner and negotiate for its return.</p>
<p>It is reported that the investigation of German expatriate property is being conducted very accurately. They have all prepared detailed registers to be submitted to the Handling Bureau for processing. Any German expatriate property that has not yet been taken into internment camps will be handled in the same way after they enter the camps.</p>
<p>The real estate received by the Central Trust Bureau will be leased and sold according to various circumstances. In addition to central government agencies having priority, ordinary residents can also request to rent or buy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enemy and puppet property received by the Third Front Army Headquarters has now all been handed over to the Bureau for handling, and no further separate processing will be conducted.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Deliberations Underway for Reasonable Measures for Recognizing Enemy and Puppet Factories <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee held its sixteenth meeting on [date], passing twenty proposals. It is reported that reasonable measures were discussed regarding preferential treatment for rear-area industrialists who contributed to the war of resistance to participate in the bidding for enemy and puppet factories. Consultations will be held with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Wartime Production Bureau to implement these measures. Furthermore, the price of goods in the city has been falling daily since the Handling Bureau supplied a large number of goods at reasonable prices several times. It has now been decided to quickly clear the materials stored in sealed warehouses and continue to sell them at reasonable prices. The fourth batch of fabrics and the second batch of matches, among other goods, will be supplied at reasonable prices in the near future, with prices expected to be even lower than before. In addition, factories resuming operations are allowed to use their existing raw materials, except for coal, which is under the unified control of the Fuel Management Committee. However, each factory must prepare a detailed register and submit it for approval, undertaking to comply with the prices approved by the government in the future. Finished products in the factories are also allowed to be sold, with government agencies having priority in purchasing. The proceeds from the sales will be deposited into a special account at the Central Bank. It is reported that the Handling Bureau will simplify the processing procedures by individually interviewing applicants and having legal advisors and representatives from relevant agencies participate. This way, application cases can be resolved immediately, avoiding delays caused by official correspondence.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Stored Good Materials Are Frequently Stolen <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Recently, alarming incidents have occurred in the warehouses taken over by the city. For example, customs personnel have been stopping [illegible], or privately removing materials, and there was even a strange fire in the North Station warehouse, among other incidents. At the sixteenth Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee meeting, a certain committee member reported that a major theft occurred in three warehouses that had already been taken over in mid-last month. On the night of the eleventh, armed thugs even broke into one of the larger warehouses with machine guns, stealing materials stored there. It is hoped that the authorities will promptly investigate and severely punish such incidents.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Military, Police, and Gendarmes Working Together to Maintain Public Order and the People's Defense Corps Could Reach 10,000 <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The recent frequent occurrences of robbery cases in the city have caused great anxiety among citizens. The issue of public security during this winter season is extremely important. This newspaper's reporters have interviewed various military, police, and gendarmerie agencies in recent days and have obtained much news that can reassure readers. This news is presented below:</p>
<p>Post-war Shanghai, like other recovered cities, faces the challenge that large numbers of firearms left among the people, as well as the activities of scattered gendarmes, can disrupt and undermine public order at any time. Of course, the increase in unemployment and the inability to control prices also affect public security.</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command is the highest authority responsible for maintaining public order in the city. After several days of consultations with relevant police parties, it has already decided on the steps to be taken. Deputy Commander Li told reporters, "We not only want to make the urban areas peaceful, but also the surrounding areas. To strengthen our forces, we have decided to coordinate with the newly established [illegible] General Corps. I believe this force is sufficient to deal with everything. As for civilian firearms, those used for legitimate defense can be licensed. If they are deliberately [illegible], they will be punished by military law once found. I hope the press will urge citizens to go to the police station for registration as soon as possible. Finally, Li also told reporters that the headquarters has organized a joint military-police-gendarmerie patrol team, divided into five zones, patrolling daily and nightly in shifts. Anyone encountered who is acting suspiciously or whose uniform is not proper will be questioned, inspected, or arrested at any time."</p>
<p>Shen Wanqian, commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, told reporters, "This regiment will do its best to assist in maintaining public order within the scope set by the Garrison Command. However, I hope that addressing the root causes is even more important than addressing the symptoms. However, such work is indeed difficult at present."</p>
<p>Although robbery cases occur from time to time, the police bureau has solved many of them and quite quickly. However, for the convenience of the authorities' investigation, it is not appropriate to disclose them here. Recently, the police bureau has been intensifying efforts to improve the Baojia organization. The city is divided into 33 districts, and there will be a major investigation of the population during the period of enemy and puppet occupation and recently. This reporter believes that this investigation will be of great help to public security.</p>
<p>Here, the reporter will introduce the newly established People's Defense General Corps. The current commander, Rong Youlue, is a famous general who bravely defended Weiyang for 46 days. Since the corps was prepared and established by the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee, it has been divided into two types of members: regular members and volunteer members. Volunteer members include former Baojia members from before the war and members of the merchant corps from the former concessions, who have been investigated, reviewed, and admitted to the corps. There are currently 2,000 to 3,000 people. By the end of this month, combined with the regular members, there will be about 10,000 people. However, they are entirely people's self-defense organizations, and their mission is only to assist the military and police in maintaining local public order.</p>
<p>Finally, a piece of good news for the people in the suburbs of the city: the Zhejiang-Shanghai Garrison Command has begun to work with the garrison troops, coming to your area. "L"</p>

<p>Zou, Deputy Director, Inspects the Japanese Prisoner-of-War Concentration Area</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Repatriation Office, having been ordered to also handle prisoners of war in the Beijing-Shanghai area, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Director Wang specially sent Deputy Director Zou [illegible] to inspect the Matsui headquarters in the Japanese prisoner-of-war concentration area on Jiangwan Road. They were greeted by Japanese Commander Lieutenant General Matsui and Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Doi. Zou [illegible] inquired in detail about the concentration situation of prisoners of war along the Beijing-Shanghai line and gave many instructions on the issue of education for the concentrated prisoners of war. According to Doi, the department has been ordered by the Chinese government to strictly prevent soldiers from escaping, so each concentration camp still maintains its original organization and hierarchical control. They also requested that the hundreds of [illegible] soldiers in the department be managed separately. It is learned that our Japanese Repatriation Office has decided to convene the original unit commanders of the prisoners of war on the Beijing-Shanghai line for a briefing within the next few days and issue a control plan, assigning personnel to be responsible for management.</p>
<p>Summary of Commander Tang's Address</p>
<p>Commander Tang attended the Japanese Self-Government Association yesterday morning and delivered an address to the Japanese who will be returning to their country one after another. He stated, "Over the past eight years, from the Lugouqiao Incident to the Japanese surrender, the pain we have suffered is beyond the imagination of the Japanese. The erroneous idea of the so-called 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' should be thoroughly corrected. In the future, we should jointly maintain world peace with truth, faith, benevolence, love, and peace."</p>
<p>The first batch of over 2,000 Japanese repatriates set off yesterday, carrying luggage and queuing up to board the ship.</p>

<p>The US Air Force's 315th Supply Squadron, which transported giant US B29 bombers to China, is scheduled to set out to return home today. Commander C. O. Righter announced the squadron's work from 1942 to today. The squadron's members left the country in the fall of 1942 and, in 40 months, [illegible] provided aircraft and supplies to the 9th, 12th, 14th, and 20th Air Forces across the three continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia. At the outbreak of the war with Britain and Germany, it was the only US Air Force supply squadron to assist the British Air Force. It came to China in 1944 and was stationed in Chengdu. At that time, the B29 aircraft used by the 14th Air Force to bomb Japan were supplied by the squadron. They had worked in England, Egypt, Sicily, and Italy, traveling tens of millions of miles and earning the reputation of being a traveling air force squadron. The squadron received a total of five service medals, three of which were for their achievements in fighting in the Middle East, and the other two for their work in Italy and supplying the Flying Tigers (i.e., the 14th Air Force) and B29s. Now, this historic work has come to an end. As Colonel C. O. Righter said, "We have achieved victory in the most difficult circumstances. Today we can return home as we wished."</p>

<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Minsheng Company's Minlian ship arrived at the Bund Wharf here yesterday at 2:30 PM. It is reported that it carried over 1,000 passengers, most of whom were employees of the United States Information Service and their families. Some passengers had already disembarked in Nanjing. The Minlian ship sailed from Chongqing to Shanghai on the 22nd of last month, taking a total of 13 days. Regarding the dispute that arose in Zhenjiang, the truth is as follows: The Minlian ship sailed east from Chongqing without incident until it reached Zhenjiang, where some naval personnel wanted to approach the ship. There were already military police escorting the ship, and it was nighttime, making it difficult to distinguish in the dark. For defensive purposes, an order was issued not to approach, or they would be shot. However, the naval personnel ignored this and continued to advance, so they were shot at from the ship, injuring a certain deputy captain. At four o'clock the next morning, as the ship was about to set sail, it was inspected by a large number of naval personnel who wanted to detain the ship. After repeated explanations of the misunderstanding by the ship and the responsible parties of the US Information Service, a resolution was reached. That evening, it docked in Jiangyin, so its arrival in Shanghai was delayed until yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Zhao Quan, the Communist "district chief" of the suburban area of Wuxi County, believing that Zhu Tukui, the township chief of Chaoyin Township in Dongting District of the county, was ineffective in collecting military grain and lenient, sent three Communist soldiers on the night of November 21st to drag Zhu Shikui out of his home and shoot [illegible] him in a wheat field. In addition, the Communist Party's Chaozhou County Government of the Sixth Administrative District of Suzhong, because the people in its jurisdiction were not cooperating with the Communist army and the Loyalist Salvation Army, which was active in the area, was constantly attacking, forced the formulation of the most vicious Baojia joint liability measures. "Whoever harms the lives and property of military and political personnel of the 'New Fourth Army' and their families, the individual, their family, and the jointly liable Baojia households will be punished. In serious cases, they must compensate for life and property." It attempts to use high-pressure tactics to stabilize the "controlled area". In addition, Qian Bosun, the puppet county magistrate of Changshu, Chen Zhenhua, the head of the county police corps, Ling Xiuying, the secretary, and Zhao Quanzhi, the head of the section, led over 300 demobilized soldiers and robbed huge amounts of grain, coarse cloth, cotton, etc., and transported them to northern Jiangsu.

<p>Since the Municipal Land Administration Bureau initiated land registration work last month, a considerable amount of time has elapsed. To understand the progress of land administration work, our reporter interviewed Mayor Qian and Land Administration Bureau Director Chen, who made the following statements:</p>
<p>#### Mayor Qian on the Significance of Consolidation</p>
<p>Mayor Qian stated: "This city has suffered years of disturbance by enemies and puppets, leading to a collapse of discipline, particularly in land administration. Since the Land Administration Bureau began consolidation, it has, last month, initiated land registration for ownership, transfer, alteration, and other rights in the six districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Hunan, Caojing, and Fahua. Simultaneously, to address land registration disorder in other areas, changes in land rights, and the loss of documents, we are implementing land transfer tax collection. The essence of initiating this registration and collection work is to consolidate land registration and ensure the property rights of owners. If registration is not completed by the deadline, the Land Administration Bureau will, according to the law, manage the properties on behalf of the owners. We hope citizens will not neglect this. Furthermore, regarding real estate used by municipal administrative, military, and police agencies, municipal public properties, and properties of various charitable organizations, we hope that all will be registered with the Land Administration Bureau to gradually consolidate land ownership, achieve equal land rights, and allow citizens to share in the benefits."</p>
<p>#### Chen Shiquan on Registration Procedures</p>
<p>The reporter then interviewed Director Chen Shiquan, who stated: Since the land registration work began, many owners have enthusiastically applied for registration, but many remain hesitant. The reason, it seems, is a lack of understanding of the registration procedures. When the reporter asked about the registration procedures and the points requiring registration, he received the following detailed answers:</p>
<p>(1) For ownership registration, transfer registration, alteration registration, and renewal of ownership certificates, properties located in the former Special District One (i.e., Huangpu District), Yinxiang District, and Zhabei District should be applied for at the First Registration Office at 66 Zhapu Road. Properties located in the former Special District Two (i.e., Huangpu District) and Fahua District should be applied for directly at the Second Registration Office at 71 Zhongzheng West Road (i.e., Daxi Road). Properties located in Hunan and Caojing Districts should be applied for at the Third Registration Office at 72 Shangwen Road.</p>
<p>(2) Provisional registration, cancellation registration, objection registration, and collection matters outside the registration area should be applied for at the bureau's office on Madang Road.</p>
<p>(3) For land in the aforementioned six districts for which ownership certificates were obtained before the war, and where there has been no transfer of rights, and those who obtained land occupancy permits before the war, with no disputes or transfers, there is no need to register; they can directly apply for renewal of their land ownership certificates.</p>
<p>(4) Those who did not obtain ownership certificates or occupancy permits before the war, and those who registered before the war but whose rights have been transferred, as well as Chinese citizens holding perpetual lease contracts or Dao contracts in the names of foreign firms, with attached right certificates, must apply for ownership and transfer registration within two months.</p>
<p>(5) If there are surface rights, easements, perpetual tenancy rights, pawn rights, or mortgage rights established before applying for ownership registration, registration of these other rights should be applied for during the public announcement period.</p>
<p>(6) All registrations and documents issued by enemy puppet organizations during the occupation period of the city are invalid and must be re-registered.</p>
<p>(7) For land or permanent structures in districts outside the above-mentioned registration areas, all transfers should be subject to transfer tax collection. If documents are completely lost due to the war, or if documents are lost, a guarantee can be obtained and, after verification and survey, a replacement contract can be applied for to manage the property.</p>

<p>At the end of last month, five or six robbers armed with weapons broke into the home of Zhao Houfu, a Zhenjiang native living at 64 Gaodun Street in Nanshi, robbing gold jewelry, counterfeit money totaling five million yuan, etc. The police were notified and pursued them.

<p>Our newspaper and Tongde Medical College are jointly organizing a Sino-American basketball game to raise funds for student aid. All preparations are largely complete. The game dates are scheduled for December 12, 15, and 16, three days, with two games each evening starting at 7:30 PM, at the Zhonghua Sports Ground on Albert Road (formerly known as Huiliqiu Ground). Invited teams include Allied American Military Police Team, Navy Team, and Air Force Team. Our teams are the Hualian Team and the Zhongqing Team. Mr. Zhang Weixiang has been running around contacting them for days, taking great pains. It is said that the persons in charge of the Allied teams very much support the charity game for student aid. In order to help the students, they are willing to show their skills and do their part for the poor students. This kindness, I know, will be greatly appreciated by the thousands of students who will be helped!</p>
<p>Tickets for the charity game are divided into two types: 400 yuan and 3,000 yuan. The former will be sold at the door, while the latter will be jointly sent by our newspaper and Tongde to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to do their best to purchase them. We also ask students from various universities to actively promote sales in the hopes of obtaining more ticket funds and saving more students who have dropped out of school, which is also cultivating more talents for the country. I believe that those who understand the general principles will definitely provide great assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Talking About Painting From Outside the Door <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shifang</p>
<p>Although I am not an insider in painting, I am, like most knowledgeable people, quite interested in looking at paintings, especially cartoons. As the world has become more and more slippery, I have deeply loved them for many years. Later, I had the opportunity to often view the works of European and American cartoonists, and I became even more deeply aware that they were sharp spears against the darkness, and I developed from an interest-based love into a reverence for weapons of justice.</p>
<p>I believe that the reason why cartoons have failed to exert their power in the course of the Anti-Japanese War is not only because the cartoonists' skills and knowledge are not enough, but also because the cartoonists are shoddy in their work and technically lazy and opportunistic.</p>
<p>I have found the biggest shortcomings in many drawings. For example, the people drawn in the paintings really cannot make people call them "people" - even a cow or a dog on the screen will make people unable to recognize it as a "cow" or a "dog". Because the heads of those people are often rectangular placed horizontally on the so-called necks, and the hands are like two pieces of wood straight. What kind of art is this? I think it should be A drawing by a child.</p>
<p>This kind of cartoon sometimes makes people feel nauseous. When some friends talk about Chinese cartoons, they often point out this shortcoming. I think cartoonists are definitely not incapable of drawing people like people, but they just want to create them arbitrarily, perhaps thinking it is to be unique, but what impression does it give the reader besides bad? In addition, when creating a cartoon, they are unwilling to put in a little more thought, which leads to stereotypes and uniformity. This has caused a fatal injury to the still weak cartoon.</p>
<p>In order to hope that it will not only not die young, but will also grow strong from now on, I want to write down two external opinions on cartoon authors.</p>
<p>(1) You must draw people like people. To take a step back, you must always draw a person who is not too far away from the human race. This requires cartoon authors to work hard on their skills and abandon the bad habit of creating arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(2) You need to think more. Think more about the composition, the meaning, and the subject matter. Cartoons are a kind of art that needs to be mixed with deep meaning. This cannot but require cartoonists to cultivate various kinds of knowledge other than painting.</p>
<p>Finally, what needs to be specially mentioned is that the low cartoon fees should be a major objective reason why cartoon authors have to produce shoddy products. How to make the reward for a work completed by a cartoonist in one or two weeks or even one or two months enough to maintain life for one or two weeks or even one or two months? This is what I want to appeal to loudly for cartoonists.</p>
<p>The times have changed again, and at the same time, we are very concerned about the direction of the cartoonists' pens in the future. Some people may feel that this direction is difficult to choose, but there is one sentence that I think can still be applied, that is, "the country first" and "the people first". If all our cultural workers can stick to these two sentences, the direction of our "pens" and even "debating skills" will not be wrong.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Debating "Going to the Public Hungry" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dongshan</p>
<p>Brother ××: I have read your opinion and I agree with it in general; it's just that I disagree with the "sermon" about "civil servants should not care about treatment under the current prices". It is impossible to "serve the public" when "hungry". For example, with a burden like mine - three sons of secondary school level must continue to study, a young daughter who has just been weaned, and an older daughter fostered in the distance, how can I have enough money every month? It's too far off. You want to separate people's hearts from material relations and forcibly pull them from the good side, but on the other hand, there is a practical force that pulls people's hearts back, and you cannot resist it. Therefore, a wise writer never fights nature hard. Fortunately, this is not the theme of your work, and the reader will forget it after reading it. Otherwise, you will be cursed.</p>
<p>I believe that except for people who are subjectively unsound and who deserve to die, no one can escape the influence of the objective material environment. Psychologists of any school have to admit the formula of "stimulus-perception-thought (or emotion, feeling)".</p>
<p>My opinion may be wrong, because I just drank a lot of wine and I am a little excited.</p>

<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>For ten years I held the Han scepter, sent to distant lands, my heart longing for home as the sun sets, my sorrow entrusted to herding sheep. The north sea wind is cold and tight; the snow on the Tianshan mountains flies high. Mountains and seas separate me from central China, my thoughts linger endlessly! When rams lose their wool, the wool grows back again, but the tassel of my scepter withers day by day, falling and breaking my heart. The ram leaves its flock, secretly pours out its heart, who grieves for the lost traveler? I look around in confusion, the bright moon shines, I look up and down in boundless vastness, I do not see the flow of the Jiang and Han rivers, but only see the clouds soaring. The four seasons change again and again, new frost adds to my temples, I sadly think of my homeland, when will I see my king? Year after year I guard the Han scepter, far away in distant lands - my heart longing for home is cut off by the setting sun, herding sheep in the desolate borderlands. I drink cold ice shavings when thirsty; I eat cold snowflakes when hungry, when will this wandering end? Tears wet my clothes!</p>

<h3 id="e83">About Bai Wei <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Yun</p>
<p>Editor: The news about female writer Bai Wei must be noted by the people of Shanghai. Indeed, she has not met the people of Shanghai for many years, like Bing Xin and Bing Ying. At least, her works have. Bing Ying has now left Sichuan and is compiling a supplement to the Peace Daily in Hankou. Bing Xin still lives in Chongqing. As for Bai Wei, actually even the people of Chongqing have not been very clear about her situation for many years. This is a misfortune. I firmly believe that she is simple and genuine, only that her works have been less in these years, and everyone seems to not pay attention. There are also people who do not understand her and have some misunderstandings about her, but I like Bai Wei, this writer, this flower-like character.</p>
<p>Also because of loneliness, her life is indeed poorer than other female writers. I cannot describe her. In the future, she will eventually have an autobiography that tells the world in detail. There is only one sentence that can be reported to everyone: that is, although she is poor, her pride is more genuine than those writers who shout slogans. Therefore, she refuses all kinds of writer relief funds. Once she even angrily tore up a 5,000 yuan check in public. Bai Wei, I like her!</p>
<h3 id="e84">Broken Wing <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— An E</p>
<p>The broken wing of a "red plaster" machine, sits limply on our land. It is said that this is the wing of an enemy plane that was shot down last time. The fuselage is still being searched for. From its broken scars, we can know that the people inside the plane have long dreamed of returning to their hometown! But do we think this is worth being proud of? No! We, the peace-loving Chinese nation, have never been willing to kill people, but can I not kill him? Can we let him run rampant in the sky, bombing our cities, villages, soldiers, and compatriots? If we tolerate this, we are traitors to the nation, traitors! We are unworthy of the blue sky and white sun above, and unworthy of the suffering ancestors below; therefore, we must do our best to eliminate them! Drive them out of China, even out of the world! We do not allow such demons in the human race with sincere hearts and hot blood!</p>
<p>Conversely, if our national soldier is killing the enemy in the air, and we on the ground are unintentionally hindering him, then what should we call this person? There are countless examples like this in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>As long as we think of the hardships of those soldiers in the sky and on the ground, as well as the tragic situation of tens of millions of compatriots who have been trampled on by the Japanese devils, can we still remain indifferent? It is certainly gratifying to shoot down the enemy's plane, but the blood and sweat of our soldiers must also not be forgotten! We mourn the death of our soldiers, but at the same time, we hate the Japanese warlords for ruining the crimes of their people! We hate even more those national scum who intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, help the enemy!</p>

<h3 id="e85">Beyond the Flying Goose Claw Doctrine <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Ancient poets liked to make free and easy words. The world likes elegance, and mistakenly believes that elegance must be free and easy. So the free and easy poisoned people, deeply and severely. In recent years, this trend has subsided slightly, but occasionally because of the love of rhetoric and the use of allusions, it is inevitable to fall into this set without realizing it. It is common to see the cover of photo albums and name lists titled "Snow Mud Flying Goose Claw," which is one example.</p>
<p>Su Shi's poem: "Where is life like? It should be a flying goose stepping on snow mud. Accidental footprints are left on the mud, where will the goose go again?"</p>
<p>The origin of "Snow Mud Flying Goose Claw" originally comes from this. This poem is unrestrained and beautiful, and many people love to chant it, but if you savor the meaning of the words carefully, its irresponsibility in dealing with the world is fully expressed in the words "accidentally where will it go again"! If you comment that "it has poisoned all living beings, who would say it is not propaganda?"</p>
<p>Someone said that the strange fires in the warehouse two days ago are also a great manifestation of the "Flying Goose Claw" spirit. I could not help but nod in agreement. However, after careful review, it is not so. The generation of "Flying Goose Claw" doctrine is free and easy and irresponsible. And the person in charge of the warehouse is desperately clinging to it but still irresponsible. Or call it "Beyond the Flying Goose Claw Doctrine", which is almost it!</p>
<p>"Beyond the Flying Goose Claw Doctrine" abounds, so it is said that "it has poisoned all living beings". And the victims are millions of citizens, so it is also said that "it has harmed all living beings". Alas, all living beings, will there be no one left?</p>

<h3 id="e86">Gold Price Continues to Fall <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The various rumors reported yesterday had not been confirmed in the press as of this morning, so the market initially seemed stable. However, intense competition between bulls and bears ensued mid-session, leading to price fluctuations. Ultimately, the bulls were unable to sustain their position before the noon close, sparking panic and breaking through the 700,000 mark, reaching a low of 686,000. Subsequently, some bankers took the opportunity to buy at the lower price, allowing the price to stabilize. The bears also covered some of their short positions. In the afternoon, the price rebounded above 700,000, eventually settling around 700,000 with some margin. The final result was a decrease of 22,000 compared to the previous closing price. Silver ornaments were priced at 76,000, standard silver at 650, and silver dollars remained at 450-460. However, due to the lackluster performance of other commodities, they also appeared weak. The underground money market saw even fewer inquiries due to recent losses for those engaging in transactions, with rates settling around 10-13 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies continued to weaken, but many sought to buy at the low prices, and influential investors were also absorbing them. The market was stable at the beginning, but later, trading houses and merchants began to sell off, increasing the pressure of actual goods. This ultimately suppressed buying interest, pushing the price below the 1,200 mark again. A major player, having previously bought a large amount of US dollars that were now unfrozen, no longer needed the physical currency and aggressively sold off, causing the price to drop to a low of 1,145 yuan. Later, with the rebound in the gold market, buying surged again, and the price eventually fluctuated around 1,180 yuan. The final result was a decrease of 35 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars once weakened along with US dollars and gold. Old banknotes fell to 190 yuan, and new banknotes fell to 62 yuan. However, they were able to recover some ground by the end of the day. The final result was a decrease of 10 yuan for old banknotes and 2 yuan for new banknotes. The buying price for Australian gold pounds fell to 2,600, and rupees to 222.</p>
<p>Government bonds were almost entirely one-sided yesterday, with outside retail investors painfully closing out their positions. The result was a further decrease of 65 yuan to 95 yuan compared to the previous day. Chinese stocks fell in tandem with gold bonds, and many long-term holders also sold off. Retail investors were unable to resist, resulting in a final loss of over 10%. Foreign stocks showed weakness with some stability. Although all declined, the drops were not significant, and strong investors absorbed a considerable amount at lower prices. With the listing of foreign exchange approaching, foreign merchants are becoming increasingly active, suggesting a potentially vibrant trend.</p>
<p>Grains: Yesterday, prices for all types of grains remained depressed. White japonica rice and white indica rice both continued to decrease by a small margin of 200-300 yuan. Lower-grade indica rice decreased by 500-600 yuan. White glutinous rice also fell by 600-700 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, with a further decrease of over 200 yuan. Oil prices fell by a small margin of 1,000 yuan, as deliveries continued to surge and Shanghai factories also sold off. Soybeans were stagnant, continuing to decrease by 600-700 yuan. Soybean cake also decreased by a small margin of 200 yuan. The liquor market remained inactive, with prices decreasing by a small margin of 500 yuan, indicating a continued downward trend.</p>
<p>The Goods Tax Bureau is levying an ad valorem tax on cotton yarn at a rate of 3.5%. For general reference, a table comparing the taxable amount for each grade of cotton yarn per 400-pound bale is provided below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Cotton cloth plummeted along with the gold price. Amidst a chorus of selling cries in the market, prices continued to decline. 20-count and 16-count fell by 30,000-40,000, and 42-count fell by 100,000. Buyers remained hesitant, resulting in very few transactions.</p>
<p>Dyes: There were many sellers, but customers were still expecting prices to fall further. Non-industry speculators, though painfully cutting losses, still saw buyers remaining hesitant, resulting in very few transactions. Auxiliary materials for dyeing exhibited a complete collapse, as orders for caustic soda and hydrosulfite were about to arrive in Shanghai. Sentiment was exceptionally weak, and the market is expected to decline further.</p>
<p>Coal Market: The coal market is gradually stabilizing, as prices have fallen sharply in recent days. Wealthy individuals are buying at lower prices, especially high-quality anthracite dust for factory use, which is in high demand. Although anthracite coal is arriving, it is only supplying public utilities. Demand for residential and factory use has not been met. The supply of firewood and charcoal continues to arrive, and traders are attempting to maintain original prices to account for costs.</p>
<p>Southern Goods: Because of increased arrivals, assorted dried longans (桂圓) saw sluggish sales and market prices have repeatedly loosened, decreasing by an estimated 30-40%. Yesterday, the opening price for more common dried longans was only 32,000 yuan. Even premium dried longans were very weak, with high-grade opening at 43,000 yuan and second-grade at less than 40,000 yuan. There were also offers of 35,000 yuan. The future market is still difficult to predict optimistically. It is also reported that there have been shipments from Wenzhou, so maintaining capital will be hard.</p>
