<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本的戰時敎育</h3>
<p>日本近年爲適應戰時緊急需要，對於學校　育，迭經改革，今日在前綫的特攻隊，在生　戰綫上的挺身隊，大部分是日本的胥年學生，日本歷年教育的眞價值，在這次戰爭甲，可　早已發揮無遺了。但是，隨着戰火日益進迫本土的嚴重形勢，日本當局對於迭經改革的戰時教育，認爲更有强化必要，因此，最近又有「戰時教育令」的公布。對於我國，實可爲他山之石，爲特紹介其大槪如次。</p>
<p>這次日本頒布的「戰時教育令」，第一條規定：「學生當盡忠肩負國運，獻身於戰時緊急之要務，使平素鍛鍊之教育效果，得以發揮無遺，並須致力於智能之磨鍊，盡其本分」。第二條規定：「教職員當率先垂範，與學生共同獻身於戰時緊急之要務，而以共學共進之精神，完成黨陶及啓迪學生之重任。」這二條已把戰時教育和盡忠獻身於衛國大業兩者合爲一事，賦與教育事業以新的使命。</p>
<p>日本戰時教育令第三條規定：「除使獻身於糧食增產，軍需生產，防空防衛及重要研究等戰時重要任務外，爲進行戰時緊要之教育訓練計，每一學校均當以教職員及學生組織學生隊，每一地域以各學生隊組織其聯合體，凡二學生隊以上之一部或全部獻身於同一職務塲所時，除文部大臣規定者以外，當按每一職務塲所以教職員及學生組織學生隊，又以學生隊組織其聯合體。關於學生隊及其聯合體之組織編制，教育訓練，指導監督等關於學生隊及其聯合體之必要事項，由文部大臣規定之。」這裏更具體規定了教育軍隊化的新辦法，使教育·生產和作戰成爲三位一體。</p>
<p>在戰時教育令的第四條中規定：「爲使學校教育之運營適應戰局之推移計，文部大臣於必要時得依其規定，將教育科目及授業時間設置特例，對學校教育之實施，採取特別措置。」同令第五條又規定：「戰時特別必要時，因學生之被徵集或召集等事由而爲軍人（包含陸海軍之學生），獻身於戰時之緊急要務而致死亡或病傷，又或修習戰時急需之專攻學科，均得按文部大臣之規定，雖未在正規期間修學或未受正式考試，亦得使其畢業（或準此資格）。」這一條更提高了文部大臣的職權，使負起與將帥類似的重大任務；同時打破了過去對於教育的傳統觀念，使大家認淸工作和戰鬥就是學問。</p>
<p>從這次日本的戰時教育令中，給予我們對於教育的新認皺，打破了江壇教育的舊傳統，替「即知即行，即行即知」的教育理論開拓了實踐的新國地，這正和我國教育界理想中的「知行合一「和「眞知力行」如出一轍。</p>
<p>要之，現在日本的新教育體制，乃使二千萬教職員和學生，朝夕獻身於保衛國家的大業，或在工場或在農村，一面工作，一面教訓，提高盡忠護國的意志，共同完遂大東亞戰爭的遠大的理想。</p>
<h3>生產與防衛一體化　日本國民義勇隊的性格</h3>
<p>日本爲應付本土戰塲化的急迫皺局，成立戰鬥性的新國民組織－國民義勇隊。目下日本全國各國各地，爲該隊實踐中核體的單位組織，正在着着進展中。一方面，中央則繼五月十二日的協議會之後，於十四日召開地方長官會議，由首相，內相問明基本方針。至此，義勇隊歷史性的開始業已完了其第一準備階段。但國民義勇隊因係網羅各界各層的全體國民的龐大組織，故其當面的組織問題固無論，即在健營指導方面，亦有許多應予解決的課題。</p>
<p>△目的與使命▽</p>
<p>國民義勇隊的目的與使命，如組織要綱所示，盡於下列三點，即：</p>
<p>以完遂各自的職責爲中樞理念，以鄉土爲核心，以期生產防衛的一體化。</p>
<p>當面的任務，專在軍需·食糧增產等戰力的增强。</p>
<p>情勢危急時，立即改爲戰鬥隊，以服務作戰所需的生產·運輸·築壕·防空復舊·救護等兵站業務爲主。</p>
<p>換言之，即對從來沒有國民基礎，紛亂而無統一的局部進行之生產及防衛勢態，予以强力而有機的組織，爲適應本土戰塲化的局勢，而發揮「隊員倒下時也不放鬆隊　，工員則斷然與機械同命，奉行轟轟烈烈義勇奉分之誠。」成立義勇隊的用意，其重大如此，所以要求各隊員有透澈的戰爭觀，在淸楚的認識與積極的實踐下，　激自己的任務。</p>
<p>嚴密的組織</p>
<p>於此，第一個問題就是：充分實現上述目的與性格的組議，應該如何？政府當局對於此點，已明確指示如下：</p>
<p>國民義勇隊是以實踐行動爲主眼的國民組織。</p>
<p>非官僚性格，須極端爲民意熟烈的結集組織。</p>
<p>排除一般團體組織隨隨便便的形式組織。</p>
<p>由此閘明當局方針，排除已在翼贊會，翼狀等充分試騐完了的官製組織之弊，使它是極端基於民意的自發的國民運動。於是同爲國民遝動戰綫的翼贊會，翼壯及其範圍下的大部分團體，均作發展性的解散，而吸收於國民義勇隊中，經此調整，僅餘唯一的政事結社，即大日本政洽會。</p>
<p>這個問題多半含有政治問題的要素，尚待政府今後的魯處，但暫時之間，義勇隊的組織，其隊員爲一定年離以內的全體國民，初不問其職業，地位，及身份如何。現正本此方針進行組織。而大日本政治會員，此時更將率先爲義勇隊的推進力，作爲模範隊員，而積極活動。</p>
<p>能幹的指導者</p>
<p>其次，關於義勇隊運動消長的重要間題，則爲指導者的人選問題。關於此事，安倍內相在地方長官會議席上曾說明下列數點：</p>
<p>關於幹部人選，如從過去所謂勢力均衡的見地，而在隨隨便便的形式下告終，則成爲祇有軀壳沒有靈魂的組織，反有妨害戰力之處。</p>
<p>指揮者或幹部人選，無論在任何組織，其適當與否，皆與組織的消長有關。尤因國民義勇隊是行動隊，具有視情勢如何而改爲戰鬥隊的使命，所以指導者的人選實與該隊的盛囊有至大關係。</p>
<p>度求深孚衃望並有統率力的人材，不問其過去如何，果敢起用之，以期在其指揮下欣然赴死。</p>
<p>人選的構想大體可以由此顯明，然此事易言繼行，其實際問題對於地方長官將是試　的機會。即雖廣求人材，然因義勇隊與　壯及其他旣存團體相異，乃是統率網羅各界各層的　大組織，所以無論如何，易於想到某種意味的有實力的長老。但此種所謂長老，往往缺乏積極性，尤其未必宜於作爲生產防衛的指導者。查如翼贊會·翼壯等，其指導者，幹部的不合，以致徒然流於觀念的革新，而其團體也呈現有似國民中特殊存在之觀，然而結果可說這也是指導者不合宜之咎。如欲調整兩者的並爲，而得其人，則全繫於畏官的時局組織和其政治的手腕。</p>
<p>運營的圓滑化</p>
<p>以上爲國民義勇隊組織的當面主要課題，此外尚有繼行各種團體所担當的緊要業務，地域職域義勇隊的調整等問題。此際最須警戒的，即爲處理如上各問題時官民的根本態度。</p>
<p>即國民義勇隊爲戰鬥的國民組織，而吸收統合旣存的國民運動團體。本問題的處理，須顧到戰局的要求與地域　域的實際情形而作具體的解決，至如從來國民遝動所見那種徒具　構的感覺，絕對非排除不可。若再陷於形式的措置，則爲羲勇隊本來使命的戰力增强，即無具體解決之望，確保不重蹈翼贊會的覆轍。</p>
<p>如是，在地域團體，則須再事檢討現在的保甲制度；在職域團體，則必加深生產軍的構想。就中負責從事增强生產的職域團體，且必發生過剩工員的整理·疏散計劃的明徼化·生活問題的解決等一聯串的生產企業對策。此事不必說是以政府遂行强力的戰爭施策爲前提的。</p>
<p>如是，國民義勇隊是以昂揚的民意爲基礎之地域戰城組織，政府竭力退居背後，從事指導，而不參與運營，從而亦不設立中央組織，但與此項方針相反，有些部面亦須政府積極行動。</p>
<p>總之，對於義勇隊强力圓滑的遝營，切望官民關於上述各點的根本認識務須透徹。（譯自五月十九日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>中共抵渝</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝軍政部長陳誠，曾於六月六日發表談話，設明渝共軍業生武力衝突，並力言根據美國租軍法案租借之武器，不能供給共軍，僅渝軍始能享受，此點殊爲各方面注目。據新華社九日延安電，中共方面引陳誠所稱「根據美對渝租軍法之供給武器，最近頓見增加，余曾對聯合軍誓約，該項武器雖一槍一彈僅使用於對敵作戰，但萬一中央軍受非友誼的軍隊攻擊時，中央軍不用自己的武器保衛自己，則有違人類之本性」，抨擊此爲渝軍公然準備內戰。該新華社電報內容略稱，陳誠所稱非友誼的軍隊，並非渝軍之謂，乃指新四軍與八路軍而言，國民黨當局否認今日尚在準備內戰，並楊言以政治方式及洽商方法謀取解決，但觀乎陳誠之談話，此實欺人之談。渝軍向聯合軍誓約，不以租借武器使用於內戰，但重慶今已揭去假面具，在陳誠談話之最後一節，已公然說明得用租借武器爲內戰使用，重慶當局準備內戰，已從秘密而進至公開聲明，故聯合國政府如增加租借軍火，則不啻助重慶之造成內亂。</p>

<h3>浙東觀感（二）</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>紹興之行（下）　田賦與田畝</p>
<p>事變前，紹興全縣所屬之農田，約有八十餘萬畝，當時田賦之徵收，能得總數百分之八十五以上。事變後以環境惡劣，縣政推行受阻，致田畝徵收數亦在逐漸減少中，三十一年約可徵得五十萬畝，三十二年已降至二十萬畝，三十三年則僅十餘萬畝，（按三十三年度之田賦徵收目前尚未結束）。三十四年度則尚未開始。</p>
<p>田賦徵收數，三十一年係每畝兩元。（鄉鎭聯合會時代）三十二年（維持會時代）依浙江省政府財政廳之規定每畝徵收二十四元，三十三年則改收每畝四十元，三十四年擬改實物徵收，其數額現尚未決定。</p>
<p>農民與地主之關係</p>
<p>按紹與之農民，泰半爲佃農，自耕農僅佔全體總數十分之一。其農田則有「大田」與「小田」之區別。前者其土地所有權，歸大地主所有，至地主與佃農之關係，乃每年「春花」（即春耕）時，所得之農作物，統歸佃農支配，彼除代地主應付各項「派款」外，泰半將餘款作爲購買肥料，種子之用。秋季收獲時，地主方面亦僅能取得收獲之農作物總量六分之一，餘仍統歸佃農。地主以鄉間目前「派款」與「臨時攤派」等項，用費浩大，故對其些微之收入，亦無異議，但田賦仍須由地主負擔。</p>
<p>小田者乃由「地腳」（按即佃農）轉租與小農，地主雖擁有土地所有權，但「地腳」則據有永遠承皺之特權。設一旦地主（即業主）將所有土地轉售地人時，其新業主對原種佃農之承種權，決不能變動。</p>
<p>小農往往於由「地腳」方面，取得承種皺前，例須有一筆頂費，數甚可觀，往往與承種畝物，土地之價值相等。（按目前紹興上則田價約五萬元，巾則田約三萬元，下則僅二萬元左右。）至小農之對地主與地脚（佃農）之地租關係，係每季每畝須交納地主六十斤榖，同時再向地脚交一百斤穀，餘歸已有。據調查紹興之上則田，每季每畝可收米二石左右，次者約一石五六左右，普通約每李每畝可收榖三百六十斤。</p>
<p>紹興以地少人多，致形成小田制度，至其田地之種類，水稻田約佔十分之五，沙田（適種雜糧）約佔十分之三。五，山田（多種雜糧與產竹木，係造林地）約佔十分之一·五，稻之出產額佔總農作物收獲量之十分之七，餘爲雜糧。</p>
<p>農作物現狀</p>
<p>去冬紹興地區嚴寒，雖爲害農作之螟虫，皆遭凍斃，得益非淺，然同時田中已下種之油菜，蠶豆，及小麥，皆遭凍死，農民田畝中下種略遲者，亦以種子凍壊，無法下種，損失不　，其程度約佔十分之七八。又以「春花」之奇損，致農民收入毫無，影響今歲夏季作物，以資金及種子肥料之缺乏，造成目前農村空前之恐慌。</p>
<p>農民生活與負担</p>
<p>「鄕長買田買　，保長吃魚吃肉，甲長忙忙碌碌，百姓抱頭痛哭」。這是紹興民間的歌謠，其實此種情形，並非紹興爲然，其他各地莫不皆然</p>
<p>目前紹興鄕間農民，因不勝苛雜之負担，相率罷種。自本年二月起，其田畝之荒廢者，已有六千畝。現已增至一萬餘畝。且農民之罷種，係集團行動，如團體巾農民有故違者，則以該鄉應付之「派款」及一切苛雜，由種者負担，經此恐嚇，故皺者日少，情勢至爲嚴重，如當局不火速設法調整，前途實有不堪設想。</p>
<p>農民等生活之不易維持，强者挺而走險，弱者自殺，如柯橋雙牘鄉，農民張某，最近發生全家八口服毒自殺之慘劇。皺謂張某擁田五十餘畝，因不能負担額外之需索，並遭法劫，致氣憤而出此下策。</p>
<p>至農民之負担情形，記者爲求報道翔實起見，曾親往近郊（離城五里）之禹陵鄉考察。按該鄉面積周圍大約三十里，有農田一萬兩千畝，歸紹興皋埠區管轄，其全鄉田畝正式規定之派款，每畝每月約共七百五十元，（分三期交付，但常增加其數額。）其他外額之供應，（如偵緝，密探隊）則須每月付米四十八石，及現款十二萬八千元。至和平區保安隊之「派米」，每月供應須兩百餘石，除此外軍隊過境，臨時之推派，與鄉保長之隨意附加，及四週惡勢力之應付，層層剝削。如是奇重之苛雜，皆須由勤勞終年，難得一飽之農民來負担，致造成目下農村破產，農民相率逃亡之現象，如此環境，實爲必然之趨勢。</p>

<h3>廣播防空情報　安定全市民心　市民防空本部解釋各要點</h3>

<p>準備警報須加辦別至於第二項「準備警報」過去常報分　戒與空襲兩種，但今後將增加準備　報，凡軍當局判斷敵機來襲上海四周而不感危險者，則發出準備　報，藉使市民注意有所準備，發令鳴放汽幣時為十秒皺一長聲及一短聲，如以圖表示則爲「——·」。布告三項明示準備警報未必在警戒警報之前發出者，特殊情形時立即發出警戒警報或空襲警報，故市民對「——·」之準備警報，須辨別淸楚，，此點應注意及之。</p>
<p>又第四項規定，防空情報禁載於報衃雜誌，故保甲機關因傳令關係等而將情報筆錄者，於警報解除後須予銷燬。</p>

The government, in order to deliberate on these two bills, held an emergency cabinet meeting within the Diet on the evening of the 10th and decided to extend the session by one day. Prime Minister Suzuki reported this to the Imperial Palace that evening, and Imperial approval was granted. Therefore, the current Assembly, which was scheduled to last for nine and ten days, has been extended to the 11th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The plenary session of the House of Peers today commenced at 11:30 AM.

<h3>Government's Attitude Towards Implementing Compulsory Service Laws: Responses from the Prime Minister and Minister of the Army to Questions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - At the plenary session of the House of Peers on the afternoon of the 10th, Prime Minister Suzuki and Army Minister Anami gave the following replies to questions from Mr. Godo Takuo regarding the government's attitude towards enhancing fighting spirit and implementing compulsory service laws:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Suzuki</p>
<p>I believe that the loyalty of the people is the foundation of combat strength. Therefore, the National Volunteer Corps is the most important organization at this critical juncture for the rise and fall of the nation. I hope that the loyalty and patriotism of all the people can be fully demonstrated through this organization.</p>
<p>Army Minister Anami</p>
<p>The primary duty of the volunteer fighting corps is to serve in military affairs. However, in order to ensure that they can exert their effectiveness even after being transferred to fighting corps, the government will provide appropriate guidance within the possible range to enhance their production capacity. At the same time, they will receive moral education to instill discipline and cultivate their inherent spirit in their production activities, so that their production capacity can be strongly demonstrated.</p>
<h3>Chief of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau Responds to Food Supply Issues</h3>

However, if a certain area suffers an air raid or enemy attacks intensify, the military itself must assume responsibility for food supplies.</p>

<p>Stockholm (Keijo), 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Reuters reports, after returning home, British and American medical officials who had inspected various wartime prisoner-of-war camps and hospitals in Tokyo in mid-February of this year stated the other day that prisoners of war in Japanese camps and hospitals are receiving extremely good treatment, and therefore they have no complaints about the supply of food, etc. Furthermore, according to a statement released yesterday by the British War Office, a delegation from the International Red Cross, which had inspected camps in Manchuria in December of last year, found that the houses where the general prisoners of war lived were equipped with electric lights, and the rooms in the camps were fully equipped with all necessary items such as bathtubs and washbasins. The quality of their food was the same as that eaten by the general guards, and there were often very substantial vegetable dishes, fruits, sugar, soybean oil, etc. Patients in the hospital ate things like white pagoda butter, cheese cakes, and eggs. All prisoners of war enjoyed six ounces of camp-made bread with each meal. There have never been any deaths among British prisoners of war in the camps. They have all been injected with vaccines to prevent typhoid, dysentery, cholera, etc. Each person is required to work eight hours a day, and there are various sports and music activities in their spare time, and there are also entertainment such as poker at night or on holidays. However, the reading of news and newspapers is completely prohibited.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th that the forces on the southern part of Okinawa Island have continued to inflict damage on the enemy, while gradually consolidating their battle lines toward the Oroku and southern Shimajiri areas. They are continuing to fight bravely against the superior enemy forces.

<p>Three Japanese Units Achieve Military Success in Burma: Army Ministry Separately Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced the following on June 11th: Sergeant First Class Mine Kuniji and eight others, while participating in operations in central Burma, used an Imperial-bestowed cannon to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's armored units, achieving glorious results. All of them perished together with the Imperial-bestowed cannon. They had previously received a commendation, and this time they were further reported to the Emperor, who specially commended them. Sergeant First Class Mine Kuniji and eight others were a platoon of anti-tank guns. They had received a special cannon bestowed by the Emperor. During the Battle of Meiktila, on March 8th, they independently fired upon more than ten enemy armored vehicles, capturing ten destroyed armored vehicles and numerous artillery pieces, throwing the enemy into confusion. On the 11th, in the northwestern area of Lake Meiktila, they engaged in a courageous fight against a superior enemy force approaching the rear of the platoon, causing two enemy tanks to catch fire, thwarting the enemy's attempt. The Imperial-bestowed cannon and all members of the platoon, including the platoon leader, perished together. The entire platoon, including the platoon leader, united around the Imperial-bestowed cannon, fought bravely with sincere faith, and established outstanding achievements, truly a model for anti-tank gun units. The Imperial-bestowed cannon was bestowed by the Emperor in the wake of the Greater East Asia War, when the government was tasked with urgently increasing the production of various weapons and began collecting metals. The Emperor specially bestowed various implements for his use for the manufacture of weapons. These weapons are all engraved with the character "Bestowed," and the Japanese military units receiving these weapons are especially grateful and name them "Imperial-Bestowed Cannon."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to an announcement by the Japanese Army Ministry on the 10th, two Japanese units, after fighting in the Imphal and Arakan areas of Burma, engaged in difficult operations, achieved great achievements, and were awarded commendations, which are now reported to the Emperor. The Tanaka Unit: This unit overcame great difficulties and completed rear-area mobile operations during the retreat from the Imphal operation. Formed in January of Showa 20 (1945), it maintained the key point of Myingyan during the battle along the Irrawaddy River. Under enemy air supremacy, it fought against a superior enemy armored force for more than two months, destroying the enemy forces. Since mid-February, it fought in isolation and defended its position for more than a month, making a great contribution to the overall operation. Later, it was ordered to retreat, broke through the enemy's encirclement, and took up a strategic position suitable for guiding subsequent overall operations. The Asanaga Boat Squadron: Since the enemy's invasion of Burma, this squadron was dispatched to the forefront in the Arakan area, overcoming all difficulties and engaging in mobile and assault operations. Under a comprehensive plan and command, it completed the task of diverting a large number of boats, contributing to the overall operation. Later, as the situation in Rangoon became urgent, it repeatedly broke through enemy encirclements to transfer troops and was stationed around Rangoon for a month, fully accomplishing its mission, making subsequent operations and transportation much easier.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Wartime Education</h3>
<p>In recent years, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of wartime, Japan has repeatedly reformed school education. Today, the special attack forces on the front lines and the suicide squads on the production front are mostly young Japanese students. The true value of Japan's long-standing education can be said to have already been fully demonstrated in this war. However, as the flames of war increasingly press closer to the mainland, the Japanese authorities believe that the repeatedly reformed wartime education needs to be further strengthened. Therefore, the "Wartime Education Order" has recently been promulgated. It can be a stone from another mountain for our country, so we will introduce its outline as follows.</p>
<p>The first article of the "Wartime Education Order" promulgated by Japan this time stipulates: "Students should be loyal and shoulder the fate of the nation, dedicate themselves to the urgent tasks of wartime, so that the effects of education cultivated in peacetime can be fully demonstrated, and must devote themselves to the refinement of intelligence and fulfill their duties." The second article stipulates: "Faculty and staff should take the lead in setting an example, dedicate themselves to the urgent tasks of wartime together with students, and complete the important tasks of moral education and enlightenment of students with the spirit of learning and progressing together." These two articles have combined wartime education and dedication to the cause of defending the country into one thing, giving the education cause a new mission.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Japanese Wartime Education Order stipulates: "In addition to dedicating themselves to wartime important tasks such as food production, military production, air defense and defense, and important research, for the purpose of conducting wartime emergency education and training, each school should organize student teams with faculty and staff and students, and each region should organize a federation with various student teams. When a part or all of two or more student teams dedicate themselves to the same workplace, except as stipulated by the Minister of Education, student teams should be organized with faculty and staff and students in each workplace, and federations should be organized with student teams. The necessary matters concerning student teams and their federations, such as organization, education and training, guidance and supervision, shall be stipulated by the Minister of Education." This concretely stipulates a new method of militarizing education, making education, production, and combat a trinity.</p>
<p>Article 4 of the Wartime Education Order stipulates: "In order to make the operation of school education adapt to the progress of the war situation, the Minister of Education may, when necessary, set special cases for educational subjects and class hours in accordance with its regulations, and take special measures for the implementation of school education." Article 5 of the same Order stipulates: "When it is especially necessary in wartime, due to the conscription or call-up of students, etc., and for soldiers (including students of the army and navy) who dedicate themselves to the urgent tasks of wartime and die or are injured, or who study wartime urgently needed specialized subjects, they may, according to the regulations of the Minister of Education, graduate (or be qualified accordingly) even if they have not studied during the regular period or have not received formal examinations." This article further enhances the powers of the Minister of Education, assigning him major tasks similar to those of generals; at the same time, it breaks the past traditional concepts of education, making everyone realize that work and combat are learning.</p>
<p>From this Japanese Wartime Education Order, we are given a new understanding of education, breaking the old tradition of Jiangtan education, and opening up a new national land for the practice of the educational theory of "knowing is acting, and acting is knowing," which is exactly the same as the "unity of knowledge and action" and "genuine knowledge and diligent practice" that our educational circles idealize.</p>
<p>In short, the new education system in Japan now makes 20 million faculty, staff, and students dedicate themselves to the cause of defending the country day and night, either in factories or in rural areas, working and teaching at the same time, raising the will to be loyal and protect the country, and jointly accomplishing the grand ideal of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Integration of Production and Defense: The Character of Japan's National Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Japan, in order to cope with the urgent situation of the mainland battlefield, has established a new combat-oriented national organization - the National Volunteer Corps. Currently, in various countries and regions throughout Japan, the organizational units for the practical core of the corps are progressing steadily. On the one hand, the central government, following the conference on May 12, convened a conference of local governors on the 14th, where the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior clarified the basic policies. Up to this point, the historical beginning of the Volunteer Corps has completed its first preparatory stage. However, because the National Volunteer Corps is a huge organization that encompasses the entire population from all walks of life, there are many issues that need to be resolved not only in terms of the immediate organizational problems, but also in terms of the healthy operation and guidance.</p>
<p>△ Purpose and Mission▽</p>
<p>The purpose and mission of the National Volunteer Corps, as stated in the organizational guidelines, are limited to the following three points:</p>
<p>To take the completion of one's own duties as the central concept, to take the hometown as the core, and to aim for the integration of production and defense.</p>
<p>The immediate task is to increase war power, such as military production and food production.</p>
<p>In times of crisis, immediately transform into a combat unit to serve mainly in the logistics operations required for combat, such as production, transportation, trench construction, air raid recovery, and rescue.</p>
<p>In other words, it is to provide a strong and organic organization to the production and defense situation, which has traditionally lacked a national foundation and is chaotic and lacks unity. In order to adapt to the situation of the mainland battlefield, it exerts "the spirit of the team members not relaxing their duties even when they fall, and the workers resolutely devoting themselves to the machines, and faithfully performing their duties with enthusiasm and dedication." The intention of establishing the Volunteer Corps is so important, so it requires each member to have a thorough understanding of the war, and to stimulate their own mission through a clear understanding and active practice.</p>
<p>Strict Organization</p>
<p>Here, the first question is: What kind of organization should fully realize the above-mentioned purpose and character? The government authorities have clearly indicated the following points on this point:</p>
<p>The National Volunteer Corps is a national organization with practical action as its main focus.</p>
<p>It is a non-bureaucratic character and must be an extremely popular and keen gathering organization.</p>
<p>Eliminate the casual organizational forms of general group organizations.</p>
<p>From this, the authorities' policy is clarified, eliminating the disadvantages of the official-made organization that has been fully tested in the Auxiliary Association and the Auxiliary Corps, etc., and making it an extremely voluntary national movement based on popular opinion. Therefore, the Auxiliary Association, the Auxiliary Corps, and most of the organizations under its scope, which are also national movement fronts, are dissolved in a developmental manner and absorbed into the National Volunteer Corps. After this adjustment, only the Dai Nippon Political Association, the only political association, remains.</p>
<p>This issue mostly contains elements of political issues and remains to be handled by the government in the future, but for the time being, the members of the Volunteer Corps are all nationals within a certain age limit, regardless of their occupation, status, or identity. It is currently being organized based on this policy. The members of the Dai Nippon Political Association will take the lead as a driving force for the Volunteer Corps, acting as model members and actively participating.</p>
<p>Capable Leaders</p>
<p>Secondly, the important issue regarding the rise and fall of the Volunteer Corps movement is the issue of selecting leaders. Regarding this matter, Interior Minister Abe explained the following points at the conference of local governors:</p>
<p>If the selection of leaders ends in a casual form from the viewpoint of the so-called balance of power in the past, it will become an organization with only a shell and no soul, and will hinder war power.</p>
<p>Whether the commander or the leader is suitable or not is related to the rise and fall of the organization in any organization. Especially since the National Volunteer Corps is an action team with the mission of changing into a combat unit depending on the situation, the selection of leaders is of great importance to the Corps's success or failure.</p>
<p>Seek talented people who are deeply trusted and have leadership skills, regardless of their past, and boldly appoint them to be willing to die under their command.</p>
<p>The concept of personnel selection can be largely clarified by this, but this matter is easy to say and difficult to do, and the actual issue will be an opportunity to test the local governors. That is, even though there is a wide search for talent, the Volunteer Corps is different from the Auxiliary Corps and other existing groups, and is a huge organization that commands and encompasses all walks of life, so it is easy to think of some kind of influential elder. However, these so-called elders often lack initiative, and are especially not necessarily suitable as leaders of production and defense. For example, the leaders and cadres of the Auxiliary Association and the Auxiliary Corps were not suitable, so they merely flowed into conceptual innovations, and their groups also appeared to be special existences in the nation. However, the result can be said to be the fault of the unsuitable leaders. If you want to adjust the two and get the right person, it all depends on the government's time-sensitive organization and its political skills.</p>
<p>Smooth Operation</p>
<p>The above are the main issues facing the National Volunteer Corps organization. In addition, there are problems such as continuing the important tasks undertaken by various groups and adjusting regional and occupational volunteer corps. The most important thing to be wary of at this time is the fundamental attitude of the government and the people when dealing with the above problems.</p>
<p>That is, the National Volunteer Corps is a combat-oriented national organization that absorbs and integrates existing national movement groups. The handling of this issue must take into account the requirements of the war situation and the actual situation of the region and the scope, and must be resolved concretely. The feeling of merely having a structure, as seen in the national movement in the past, must absolutely be eliminated. If we fall into formal measures again, the war power enhancement of the Volunteer Corps' original mission will not have a concrete solution, ensuring that we do not repeat the mistakes of the Auxiliary Association.</p>
<p>If so, in regional groups, the current security system must be reviewed again; in occupational groups, the concept of a production army must be deepened. Among them, the occupational groups responsible for increasing production must also have a clear understanding of a series of production enterprise countermeasures, such as the reorganization and dispersal plan for excess workers and the solution to livelihood problems. Needless to say, this is premised on the government's implementation of strong war policies.</p>
<p>As such, the National Volunteer Corps is a regional war city organization based on the uplifting will of the people. The government strives to retreat behind the scenes, engage in guidance, and not participate in operations, and therefore does not establish a central organization, but contrary to this policy, the government must take active action in some areas.</p>
<p>In short, for the strong and smooth operation of the Volunteer Corps, it is hoped that the fundamental understanding of the above points by the government and the people must be thorough. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, May 19)</p>
<h3>Japan Uses Gas to Manufacture Saltwater</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Most Oil Company in Yamagata Prefecture is now paying attention to using the petroleum gas emitted from the oil field to make saltwater. This gas is injected into large iron pots containing saltwater and boiled to complete a one-shot, two-birds strategy. A large-scale production plan is currently underway. The concentration of the saltwater is about twice that of ordinary seawater, and the calorific value of the gas is about 7,000 calories.</p>

<p>Acting Chairman Chen specially issued a statement clarifying the significance of convening the Congress. The original text is as follows: Since the Sixth National Congress held by our party in August of the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], six years have passed. Under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, all comrades of our party, based on the established party program and national policy, have made efforts to adapt to the times and save the nation. Although we have not been able to fully complete the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, and achieve the goal of the party's highest political ideals, the long-cherished wishes of our party for the past fifty years, such as abolishing extraterritorial rights, recovering concessions, and abolishing unequal treaties, have been gradually realized with the cooperation of the Allied countries and domestic figures. Unfortunately, in November of last year, our late Chairman Wang passed away due to illness caused by overwork, depriving us of the guidance of a great leader in the midst of our arduous struggle. The world situation has become increasingly serious, and the Greater East Asia War has reached its final decisive stage. In order to review past work, adapt to the current environment, and shoulder the tasks of the times, our party has specifically decided to convene a National Provisional Congress on October 10th of this year, following the precedent of convening a Provisional National Congress in Hankou after the Fifth National Congress of our party, gathering all talents within the party to discuss future national affairs and strengthen the party's leadership, urging compatriots across the country to uphold justice and curb chaos, in order to complete the great cause of the party's indivisibility and the nation's unity.</p>

<h3>Montgomery Broadcasts to Germans</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a Reuters report received here, General Montgomery made a broadcast to the Germans in the British occupied zone last night, stating in brief that the Allied side has decided that the German people and their children should not only know that they are the people of a defeated country, but also understand that the country has committed the crime of starting the war. If they do not understand this situation, they and their children will be easily deceived by leaders and start war again. During the war, your leaders will certainly not let the people know how the people of the world feel about you. You thought that once our Allied forces stepped into Germany, it would be as if nothing had happened and you would be treated as friends, but the reality is not that simple. Many of our comrades have died at gunpoint, families have been destroyed, and wives and children are starving. Is this not caused by you? Therefore, you should make this situation deeply understood by women and tell them "Why the British soldiers don't show a trace of smile on their faces."</p>
<p>General Montgomery also pointed out that "the order of no friendship with Germans" will not be relaxed, and added, "You don't have to doubt why, when you wave to British soldiers or say good morning, or when your children play with them, they don't smile, because they dare not disobey the 'no friendship with Germans' order."</p>
<h3>Tito's National Army Begins Withdrawal from Trieste</h3>

<h3>Canada Holds General Election</h3>
<p>Stockholm, November 11th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a report from Ottawa: More than seven million Canadian men and women are participating in the general election movement today. It is reported that the general election of the Canadian Dominion is actually a competition between the Liberal Party led by King and the Progressive Conservative Party led by Bracken.</p>
<h3>CCP Arrives in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News: Chen Cheng, Minister of Military and Political Affairs of Chongqing, made a statement on June 6, stating that there had been armed conflicts between the Chongqing Communist troops and emphasized that weapons leased under the US Lend-Lease Act could not be supplied to the Communist troops, and only the Chongqing troops could enjoy them. This point has attracted attention from all sides. According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 9th, the CCP criticized Chen Cheng's statement that "the supply of weapons under the US Lend-Lease Act to Chongqing has recently increased significantly. I have sworn to the Allied forces that these weapons, even one gun and one bullet, will only be used in combat against the enemy. However, if the Central Army is attacked by unfriendly troops and does not use its own weapons to defend itself, it will violate human nature," criticizing this as the Chongqing army's open preparation for civil war. The content of the New China News Agency telegram briefly stated that the unfriendly troops referred to by Chen Cheng were not the Chongqing army, but the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army. The Kuomintang authorities denied that they were still preparing for civil war today and claimed to seek a solution through political means and negotiation methods, but judging from Chen Cheng's remarks, this is deceptive talk. The Chongqing army has sworn to the Allied forces not to use leased weapons in civil war, but Chongqing has now removed its mask. In the last section of Chen Cheng's remarks, it has openly stated that it can use leased weapons for civil war. The Chongqing authorities' preparation for civil war has moved from secret to open statement, so if the United Nations government increases the lease of military materials, it is tantamount to helping Chongqing create civil unrest.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (II)</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Journey to Shaoxing (Part II) Land Tax and Land</p>
<p>Before the incident [war], the agricultural land in Shaoxing County was approximately 800,000 mu. At that time, the collection of land tax could reach more than 85% of the total. After the incident, due to the harsh environment and the obstruction of county administration, the number of mu collected also gradually decreased. In the 31st year [1942], about 500,000 mu could be collected, in the 32nd year [1943], it had dropped to 200,000 mu, and in the 33rd year [1944], it was only more than 100,000 mu (Note: The land tax collection for the 33rd year has not yet ended). The 34th year [1945] has not yet started.</p>
<p>The land tax collection amount was two yuan per mu in the 31st year (during the Township Joint Association era). In the 32nd year (during the Maintenance Committee era), it was 24 yuan per mu according to the regulations of the Finance Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. In the 33rd year, it was changed to 40 yuan per mu. In the 34th year, it is planned to change to in-kind collection, and the amount has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Farmers and Landlords</p>
<p>According to Shaoxing, most of the farmers are tenant farmers, and self-cultivating farmers account for only one-tenth of the total number. The farmland is divided into "large fields" and "small fields". The former, the ownership of the land belongs to the large landlords. As for the relationship between the landlords and tenant farmers, the crops obtained during the "spring flower" (i.e., spring plowing) each year are all at the disposal of the tenant farmers. In addition to paying various "allocations" for the landlords, most of the remaining money is used to purchase fertilizers and seeds. During the autumn harvest, the landlords can only obtain one-sixth of the total amount of harvested crops, and the remainder is still at the disposal of the tenant farmers. The landlords have no objection to their small income because the current "allocations" and "temporary apportionments" in the countryside are very expensive, but the land tax must still be borne by the landlords.</p>
<p>Small fields are sublet by "dijiao" (i.e., tenant farmers) to small farmers. Although the landlords own the land, the "dijiao" have the permanent privilege of subletting. Once the landlord (i.e., the owner) sells all the land to others, the new owner cannot change the original tenant farmers' right to sublet.</p>
<p>Small farmers often have to pay a considerable top fee before obtaining the right to sublet from the "dijiao", which is often equal to the value of the land being sublet (Note: Currently, the price of top-grade land in Shaoxing is about 50,000 yuan, medium-grade land is about 30,000 yuan, and low-grade land is only about 20,000 yuan). As for the land rent relationship between small farmers and landlords and "dijiao" (tenant farmers), each mu must pay 60 catties of grain to the landlord each season, and 100 catties of grain to the "dijiao", and the remainder is theirs. According to the survey, the top-grade fields in Shaoxing can yield about two dan of rice per mu per season, the second-grade fields can yield about one dan and five or six dou, and the average can yield about 360 catties of grain per mu.</p>
<p>Shaoxing has a small land area and a large population, which has led to the formation of the small field system. The types of land include paddy fields, which account for about 50%, sandy fields (suitable for growing miscellaneous grains), which account for about 35%, and mountain fields (mostly growing miscellaneous grains and producing bamboo and wood, which are afforestation land), which account for about 15%. The output of rice accounts for about 70% of the total crop yield, and the remainder is miscellaneous grains.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Crops</p>
<p>The severe cold in the Shaoxing area last winter, although it killed the rice borers that harm crops, which was very beneficial, at the same time, the rapeseed, broad beans, and wheat that had been planted in the fields were all frozen to death. Farmers who planted slightly later in their fields also had their seeds frozen and unable to plant, resulting in considerable losses, which accounted for about 70-80%. Moreover, due to the strange damage to the "spring flowers", the farmers had no income, which affected the summer crops this year. The lack of funds, seeds, and fertilizers has created an unprecedented panic in the countryside.</p>
<p>Farmers' Lives and Burdens</p>
<p>"The village chief buys fields and buys..., the bao chief eats fish and eats meat, the jia chief is busy, and the people cry in their arms." This is a folk song in Shaoxing. In fact, this situation is not unique to Shaoxing, but is the same everywhere else.</p>
<p>Currently, farmers in the Shaoxing countryside are unable to bear the heavy burdens and are stopping planting. Since February of this year, the number of abandoned fields has been 6,000 mu. It has now increased to more than 10,000 mu. Moreover, the farmers' cessation of planting is a group action. If the farmers in the group violate this, the "allocations" and all kinds of burdens that the village should pay will be borne by those who plant. Under this intimidation, there are fewer and fewer planters, and the situation is very serious. If the authorities do not quickly find a way to adjust it, the future will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>The lives of farmers are not easy to maintain. The strong take risks, and the weak commit suicide. For example, in Shuangdu Village, Keqiao, a tragedy occurred recently in which the Zhang family of eight people committed suicide by taking poison. It is said that Zhang owned more than 50 mu of land, but he could not bear the extra demands and was robbed by the law, which caused him to be angry and take this desperate measure.</p>
<p>As for the situation of the farmers' burdens, in order to report accurately, the reporter went to Yuling Township, a suburb (five miles from the city), for investigation. According to the investigation, the township covers an area of about 30 li in circumference, with 12,000 mu of farmland, which is under the jurisdiction of the Gaobu District of Shaoxing. The officially stipulated allocations for the township's farmland are about 750 yuan per mu per month (delivered in three installments, but the amount is often increased). Other extra supplies (such as detectives and secret service teams) require 48 dan of rice and 128,000 yuan in cash per month. As for the "allocated rice" of the Peace District Security Team, more than 200 dan must be supplied each month. In addition, troops passing through, temporary apportionments, arbitrary additions by township and bao chiefs, and the need to deal with the surrounding evil forces, are layers of exploitation. Such heavy burdens must be borne by farmers who work hard all year round but can hardly get enough to eat, which has led to the current phenomenon of rural bankruptcy and farmers fleeing. This environment is an inevitable trend.</p>

<h3>Broadcasting Air Raid Information to Stabilize People's Hearts, Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters Explains Key Points</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters has issued a notice to promote the activities of people's air defense during air raids. From the 10th of this month, air defense information will be broadcast and a preparation alarm will be issued. The content is divided into four points, which were published in the newspapers on the 10th. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters respectfully issued a statement explaining the notice, pointing out that the first and second items in the notice are the most important. Broadcasting the enemy's air raid situation by radio can avoid confusion during air raids, eliminate rumors and enemy strategic thinking warfare, and stabilize people's hearts. Moreover, this kind of air defense information can fully exert production functions. Therefore, citizens should listen to the radio when the report is issued, and pedestrians on the road can listen to the loudspeakers set up on the street and take appropriate measures. For the sake of perfection, the Air Defense Headquarters plans to send mobile broadcasting vehicles to report news in various parts of the city. Due to the current power supply situation, citizens should make full use of crystal radios as much as possible in order to adapt to power saving and light control.</p>
<p>Preparation Alarms Must Be Distinguished As for the second item, "Preparation Alarm," in the past, alarms were often divided into alert and air raid. However, a preparation alarm will be added in the future. When the military authorities judge that enemy planes are attacking the vicinity of Shanghai but do not feel dangerous, a preparation alarm will be issued to make citizens pay attention and prepare. When the order is given to sound the siren, it will be a ten-second long sound and a short sound, which is represented by "——·" in the diagram. Item three of the notice clearly states that the preparation alarm may not be issued before the alert alarm. In special circumstances, an alert alarm or air raid alarm will be issued immediately. Therefore, citizens must clearly distinguish the "——·" preparation alarm. This point should be noted.</p>
<p>In addition, item four stipulates that air defense information is prohibited from being published in newspapers and magazines. Therefore, the Baojia organizations must destroy the information recorded for the purpose of transmitting orders after the alarm is lifted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy Strengthens Internal Structure, Newly Established Police Department Governs Four Sections</h3>

In addition to the Chief of the Secretariat, a new Police Department has been established, with Consul General Yoda as the head. The Police Department governs the Police Affairs, Special Affairs, Security, and Military Affairs Sections. The original General Affairs, Enemy Property, and Investigation Sections have been merged into the General Affairs Section, and the Reporting Team has been changed to the Reporting Section. The Commercial, Agricultural, Financial, Transportation, and Administrative Sections are similarly equipped with counselors and investigators to maintain close contact with the ministers. It is reported that the new structure has been implemented since the 11th.</p>
<h3>Housing Rental Disputes: First Mediation Session Held on the 19th</h3>
<p>Following the National Government's promulgation of the "Wartime Housing Rental Dispute Resolution Act" on April 11th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, acting on instructions from the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Social Welfare, established a "Housing Rental Dispute Mediation Committee" in accordance with Article 4 of the aforementioned act. Hu Shouqi, the former Chief Secretary of the Bureau, was appointed as the Chairman of the Mediation Committee. Qian Da Kui, a judge recommended by the Shanghai Local Court, and Yuan Ludeng, the Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, were appointed as committee members. The committee commenced operations on May 1st. When handling housing rental dispute cases, the committee first conducts preliminary investigations and solicits opinions, then encourages the disputing parties to reach a settlement. If repeated attempts at reconciliation fail, the Mediation Committee will convene a meeting to summon both parties for verbal debate. The Mediation Committee will then decide on a resolution, and the mediation document will be delivered to both parties for compliance. If a disputing party receives the aforementioned mediation document and disagrees with the resolution or cannot accept it, they must raise an objection within ten days; otherwise, the mediation is deemed established, and the other party may apply to the court for compulsory enforcement. If one of the disputing parties raises an objection, they may file a lawsuit with the court within one month. Article 17 of the Resolution Act stipulates that disputing parties who engage in the following acts during the mediation period shall be subject to a fine of up to 5,000 yuan: Landlords who close the housing or use other methods to obstruct the tenant's residence; Tenants who damage the housing and its attached property; Those who fail to attend the hearing without legitimate reason. The aforementioned fines shall be determined by the Mediation Committee based on the severity of the circumstances, and the party concerned shall be notified to pay within a specified period. It is also learned that the committee has scheduled its first mediation committee meeting for 2:00 PM on June 19th. It is expected that all rental disputes in the city will be fairly resolved at that time.</p>

<h3>Construction Bureau Plans to Dig Large Earth Wells</h3>
<p>In response to the urgent need for water among citizens and to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, the Municipal Construction Bureau plans to first dig a number of earth wells in areas relatively far from the river. All drawings and plans have been drafted and construction will commence soon. Furthermore, as many citizens have recently been digging wells, the results are often unsatisfactory. The reasons for this are mainly that the owners are greedy for cheapness, the contractors are perfunctory, there is no guidance or supervision, and well-digging is not handled by contractors registered with the bureau. In order to rectify this situation, the bureau has specially drafted various earth well excavation drawings. In the future, citizens who have any inquiries about well-digging matters can contact the Second Section of the bureau at any time.</p>

<h3>An Appeal from an Impoverished Scholar</h3>
<p>According to a letter from an impoverished scholar: "I make a living as a teacher, but I have many children, and we eat three meals of porridge a day. I rely on pawns and loans to make ends meet. Recently, the cost of living has increased dramatically, and I have exhausted all means. It is difficult to continue. I have no choice but to find humble jobs for my two eldest daughters. The eldest daughter graduated from a higher normal school, and the second daughter graduated from junior high school. If there are any teaching positions available that provide accommodation, I will not consider the salary. I also humbly request charitable organizations to foster and educate my four and five sons. I saw an advertisement in the newspaper that it only costs several thousand yuan to adopt a child. If it is less than 10,000 yuan, I will do my best to make do and fulfill my duty. I only ask for someone to take care of them. If anyone lacks children and can afford to raise and educate them, I am willing to give them away unconditionally." If there are any kind people who can provide assistance, please write to the Social Services Department of this newspaper for forwarding.</p>
