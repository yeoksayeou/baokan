<h3>日軍各主力部隊待機採包圍形勢　呂宋島各地戰事日益苛烈</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫七日中央社電　呂宋島各地戰爭，日形苛烈，呂宋中部平原各地之日軍，刻正與敵南下部除展開激戰中，克拉克菲爾特方面之白刃戰，仍在繼續中，敵南下部隊之前進，已遭阻止。馬尼刺北方馬羅每特拉八公里白鷺橋附近之日軍，邀擊南下敵軍的兩營，而粉碎其軍用卡車二十餘輛，斃敵約百餘名，目下仍在激戰中。莫尼的斯方面敵軍一師，三日在重砲之掩護下，展開攻勢，然悉遭日軍擊退，該地東北桑霍塞方面之敵軍砲兵部隊兩連，十五機砲隊兩連，第十機砲隊一連，迫擊砲一連，戰車二十輛，步兵一團，均遭日軍突擊隊擊退。又普托剛莫尼得斯方面，於一日至三日內，敵軍損失九百名，同時並被日軍破壞戰車八輛，卡車二十八輛，毫引車十輛，自動砲八門，迫擊砲八門，速射砲五門，此外，並鹵獲其重機關槍五挺，自動步槍二十二挺，無綫電機二架。其他於馬尼刺南方地區之敵軍，企圖由那斯克布東進，然在該地東方十五公里附近被阻，日軍各主力刻正制壓敵軍之背後及側面，而待機採取包圍形勢，敵軍刻正大事增援中，是則菲島戰局漸趨複雜。</p>
<p>菲島前綫七日中央社電　呂宋島之敵軍，三日夕刻以戰車及坦克車侵入馬尼刺市北部，同時以空挺部隊降落該市北部之卡羅坎機塲，在聖多馬斯大學及極東大學附近，與島內之日軍激戰，聖多馬斯大學附近市西茲克河北岸之敵軍，對南岸日軍陣地猛加砲擊，火光冲天。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地七日中央社電　克拉克菲爾特地區之敵軍，六日續向日軍陣地砲擊，並於日軍陣地前方構築陣地，目下該地日軍連夜突擊，至六日止，計擊落敵機二十二架，破壞戰車七輛及其他車輛十數輛，鹵獲機關槍，迫擊砲甚多，斃敵多名。</p>
<p>日軍夜襲收獲戰果</p>
<p>呂宋前綫日軍某基地七日中央社電　敵軍因急於奪回馬尼刺，乃將其攻勢綫形成半圓徑，不顧一切，反覆進攻馬尼刺週邊，其一部已侵入市內，又那斯克布北口之敵軍，幷已開始對亞卡附近之日軍陣地作總攻擊，日軍據守峻險山地，阻其前進，嗣敵軍爲圖打開此種膠着狀態，乃於亞卡及達蓋台附近降落落下傘部隊，藉以增强後援，然經該方面日軍急襲，損失慘重。又巴打半島北部，敵軍於斯北克東方隘路口遭日軍反攻，目下陷於停滯狀態，自聖法南多南下之敵軍主力，侵入馬羅羅斯地區，圖渡越班班加河，對此防守河綫之日軍加以猛攻，數度將之擊退，刻正繼續展開激戰中。馬羅羅斯東方之聖瑪利亞，亦有敵機甲部隊一部自北方侵入該地，日軍當即敢行熾烈之肉搏，斃敵軍百五十餘，毀壞戰車裝甲車三十餘輛，目下猶在繼續猛攻中。四日夜聖瑪利亞附近有敵載重汽車百餘輛，滿載兵員，於移動中遭日軍砲兵部隊猛烈砲擊，將之擊退，現竭力窺犯馬尼刺之敵軍，以美菲軍系之若干兵力，於三日暗夜侵入馬尼剌市內，日守軍即奮勇邀擊，予以殲滅之打擊，同時，敵軍幷嗾使遊擊部隊潛入馬尼刺附近。到處放火，更以炸彈毀壞貫通市心希格河之主要橋樑，四日，市內各處發生火災，整個馬尼刺將爲美軍之殘忍狂暴而犧牲矣一。因之，菲律賓市民極爲憤激，一方自呂宋平原東進侵犯莫尼的斯之敵軍，以相當之砲兵及步兵兵力，於熾烈之砲擊後，步兵開始逼攻，然日軍據守平坦之不利陣地，奮戰激鬥，迭次擊退來犯之敵軍，查間忍受敵軍之砲擊，入夜則急轉守爲攻，自二日至三日，所收獲之戰果，計焚毀M4型戰車六，破壞裝甲車一，大砲二，迫擊砲二，擊落戰鬥機一，殺傷人員達五百以上。又仁牙因灣敵橋頭堡北側達莫爾迭斯基地，敵仍逐决强化其防衛陣地，自仁牙因灣內之艦砲射擊，亦仍繼續中，敵兵並未前進，於此一週中，戰綫幾無變化。</p>
<h3>太平洋各島日軍狀況</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　大宮島基地之合衆社前綫特派員，五日將在太平洋前綫及背後各島嶼舊戰中之日軍狀况報吿如下：太平洋各島嶼殘留之日軍部隊，武裝甚爲整齊，且食糧甚佳。據偵察隊報吿稱：日兵似皆健壯，而且使用秘密輸入之優秀裝備，其食糧菜蔬，均係自給自足。</p>
<h3>拉巴爾日軍士氣昂揚</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地七日中央社電　拉巴爾地區，於一月間之敵機來襲數爲四一一架，奧甫灣及外脫灣地區，一日曾有敵機二十二架來襲。此方面之敵機稍見活潑，澳洲最近頻頻與東南方面之作戰呼應，傳有攻略拉巴爾之企圖。據日軍航空隊偵察新不列顚島南北海岸一帶結果，該處並無敵艦出入及機塲之使用形跡，敵軍所呼號之東南方面之新攻勢，僅不過宣傳而已，總之，拉巴爾方面之日軍部隊，不問敵軍之企岡如何，士氣益加昂揚，敵軍之攻勢，必予粉碎。</p>
<h3>發揚增產意識加強運輸力　日本對華新經濟政策內容</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　中國經濟與日本遂行戰爭，實有重大關係，關於確保中國之經濟安定，日本已盡各種援助，重光大東亞相於此次議會開幕時，即在衆院席上宣稱，關於中國經濟改善之急務，日本曾提出對華新經濟政策，强力促其實現，此外，在貴衆兩院各議員亦曾提出質疑，日本之新經濟政策全貌已逐漸明瞭，其具體施策大要如次：（一）於現地設置新政策實施之綜合指導機關，此新機關大的分下列二階段，甲，最高指導機關，由駐華大使，總軍司令官及艦隊司令三者構成，此機關握有新施策之推進决定權。乙，設各地促進機關，目下設有大使館事務所之北京·張家口·上海·廣州四處一，作爲華北·華中·華南·蒙張四地之中心，以事務所長公使及陸海軍代表稱成此新機關。（二）物資調度計劃之一元化，關於物資之調度，當於一元化之計劃下，岡謀調整之效率，以避免雙重收買。（三）當地運輸力之强化，除强化華北華中兩鐵路之輸送力外，並確立胞合輸送力之收買計劃，以謀日本國內與當地間陸海輸送力之脗合，藉期避免物資之停滯。（四）中國經濟之維持及培養，發揚中國方面之生產意識及其向上力，以使食糧生活必需品煤炭等增產，並力保當地輕工業之復興。此外，並動員帆船等，以期加强運輸力。（五）擁護現行通貨制度，中國貨幣之經濟現狀，目通貨表面觀之，似乎若干膨脹，然始終擁護聯銀券及儲備券，同時對於通貨發行之調整，遊賽之收回，以及當地資金之調整，已逐漸實施。（六）刷新當地日人之經濟活動，對華北開發及華中振興公司及日本各商社，促其認識新政策之根本精神，以期企業之善隣的運營。又關於以上新經濟政策，目去年十二月中旬駐華大使館事務所長會議中，完全意見一致，嗣更經閣議予以决定。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論公益重於私利</h3>
<p>昨天本市市民福利協會，爲募集冬賑經費及軍警贈金，邀集各同業公會負責人共同討論，結果圓滿。（消息載今日本報第三版）。我們從道個會議的經過觀察，發生如下的感想：</p>
<p>第一，這次會談的目的，完全是上海社會的公益，是響應周市長所期待我們上海市民的：「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」。我們在昨天的社評中說：「過去警察的勒索行爲，大家一致口誅筆伐，現在這種行爲已經消滅，是由於當局整飭風紀與提高待遇的結果，在我們市民的立塲，也應有協助政府與鼓勵軍警的表示。這個建議，能否實現，可以視爲社會人士能否轉移性格，能否做到公益重於私利的試金石。」依照昨天市民福利協會開會的結果，社會各界領袖的熱忱流露，重視公益，大有人在，這是極堪欣幸的。</p>
<p>第二，會談討論的中心，是怎樣分配捐款，怎樣提前墊借，各業領袖均能踴躍認捐，踴躍認墊，尤其是詹沛霖君獨自認捐一百萬元，許冠羣君個人認墊一百萬元，張寳存君代表同業認捐一百萬元，均值稱道。我們相信資力雄厚的殷富紳商，如詹許諸君者，在上海區域內決非少數，希望自發的奮起公益重於私利的熱心。</p>
<p>第三，銀錢業是金融界主腦，年來銀行業務雖不如蹶起各業的興盛獲利，而銀錢業的領袖都是社會有地位有聲望人士，所以當仁不讓仍居領導地位。尤其是中國交通兩銀行業務經營向極審愼穩健，實際上在近年的經濟社會中如完全以賺錢目的而言，是比較不能適應環境的，與若干歷史悠久的銀行均被稱爲銀行業中的隱貧者，可是，爲了公益，唐壽民君特別熱心，担任鉅數墊款，這也是值得佩服的。</p>
<p>第四，這次被邀的各業公會負責人的一百三十餘人，而出席的僅三十餘人，祗及四分之一。從大部分同業公會負責人規避出席一點而言，不無遺憾。雖有一部分聲明原委不克出席的，但其中尚有旣不委派代表，又不聲明不能出席原因的，老實說是存着觀望態度。嚴格的說，這一般人就是不能做到「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」的自私自利者。不過，他們雖則規避出席，而社會所課予的責任却無從諉卸的，現在依據決定的攤認單位，當然不能再存觀望態度。我們居於輿論界的立塲，願作箴吿，希望從速負起責任，不必爲社會所側目。</p>
<p>第五，按福利會邀請的各業公會，並未包括本市全部工商業，尚有許多公會遺漏未邀，因此未有認捐的責任。不過，我們希望凡是未會派到的各業公會，應該自動的認捐，共同負起應有的責任，不要以爲未會派到而認爲僥俸。必須有了「公益爭先」的精神，才能穩定「私利」的保持</p>
<p>總之，我們對於這個集會的目的與圓滿結果，認爲是很少前見，意義深遠的一個盛會。也可以證明「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」的一點，在上海各界領袖中仍可振起這種精神。可是，對於尚有少數的觀望份子，我們輿論界一致先加督促，繼以制裁。造成周市長期待我們的良好風氣。</p>
<h3>日決戰生產確立要綱已通過</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日財界以現態勢下各事態之重要性，爲克服危局，深信僅以原來一切計劃，不能打開目前難局，去冬以來，經重要產業協議會及其他會合之研討結果，迄本月五日重要協理事會終於通過決戰生產確立要綱。此外，財界出身現爲綜合計劃局參事源野良三，長崎英造，千葉三郞三氏，亦對此曾各別進行檢討，其理想與此相仿。最近並由財界向政府及陸，海軍當局提出意見，自任何情况觀之，該問題將於最近展開，而財界所期望者，爲明確算定此際以菲律賓及日本本土爲中心之防衛上最低軍需充足目標，爲達成此目的，在鋼·鐵·煤·油·金屬·飛機·造船·液體燃料等允其重要之產業部門，設置可以容納現下統制會及工業會等之强力一元化運營之機構。政府對此運營機情，授與該產業運營上必要之權限，地方行政官廳，處於監督地位，此不僅於生產權上之統一得以校正，即完成非常生產，亦不難實現。</p>
<h3>日貴眾兩院暫時休會</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日議會再開以來，連日續行審議，兩院之審議亦按照預定順序進行，衆議院自八日，貴族院自十二日起，處於臨機應戀之態勢下，均暫時休會。</p>
<h3>日山本英輔諸氏聯名提強力施策</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日山本英輔·德富蘇峯·葛生能久·松永壽雄·皆川治廣·黑澤西藏·四王天延孝·小林順一·橫尾惣三郞諸氏，以日本自開國以來，突破危機之法，即在傾日本一億國民之總力，從事戰爭，並聯合官民之力量，使强力政策速决速斷速行，茲於六日特以十條具體方案並緊急國策斷行之件，向小磯首相提出，其旨如次：（一）一切之勝利之原因，斷在速决行。（二）應澈底一億總戰死之决意。（三）緊急增產木製飛機。（四）重要工塲歸國家經營，同時劃期改革勤勞管理。（五）重要軍需工塲，應急速斷行疎開。（六）即時斷行澈底之動員。（七）中學授課，原則停止，應澈底實施專爲造就人材之敎育。（餘略）</p>
<h3>渝方承認南雄失陷</h3>
<p>日軍已進抵南安</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　重慶路透社特派員已承認以覆減遂贛航空基地羣爲目樑之日軍繼遂川攻陷之後，又將南雄佔領，其六日之報吿如下：日軍部隊三日佔領廣東省之南雄，故渝方又喪失粵漢綫東方一航空基地，</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據重慶來電，渝軍司令部十六日發表戰報稱：自粵漢綫上要衝韶關東進之日軍，刻已進抵該市東北方九十五公里銀礦重要產地南安（大庾）即將占領該處。</p>
<h3>美報告書透露渝生產低落</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　此間稱：渝政權治下之軍事政治經濟各部門，皆陷人混亂狀態，美國對重慶之希望亦遭遇種種障礙。最近美戰時情報局於全美各報上所發表之「關於重慶之公式報吿」，即暗示前述情形之實况，藉此復可知美國侵略渝方之企圖。茲誌該報吿書之要旨如次：中國抗戰七年之後，工業鐵路喪失八成，除公路之外，一切道路皆被杜絕，故輸入亦吿中斷。據納爾遜之提議，渝美兩者間雖曾講求對策，而最初實行之事項，須由美國增加輸入，改良腹地輸送機關，派遣美國及於美國訓練之技術家勞動者，從事於工業及運輸部門之計劃，並設置原料軍需生產統制管理局等機構。對於運輸方面，因載重汽車缺乏，今後須依賴大量勞工與載貨馬車，運到昆明之貨物，其中七成因當地運輸機關之欠周全，結果延誤數閱月之久。第二及第三次參政會議席上，中共發表反對見解，關於渝方之其他問題如各地軍閥等不與抗戰之渝方協力，此對於渝方之統一戰綫，實爲一有力之妨碍。基於貸與法案之對渝援助，亦因渝方腹地之事情繁雜而不得不限制，國內之輸送不便，更助長其困難。重慶曾稱去年完成公路九百餘哩，然因日軍之作戰業已被破壞。又關於中國之經濟力，尚指出下列三點：（一）工業地帶及運輸組織與天然資源，皆落於日軍之手，（二）沿海一帶之被封鎖，軍需品運入遭受限制（三）政府之經濟統制力頗爲貧弱，如腹地之通貨膨脹，對於生產機構障碍甚大。納爾遜於前此參政會之聲明中曾警吿稱：重慶不能獲生產戰之勝利，重慶之現狀勢必趨於黑暗，而民衆之生產努力情形，尤爲渝方勝敗之關鍵云。</p>
<h3>日空軍威脅印緬滇運輸</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　斯蒂威爾公路及舊緬甸公路打通後，自印度滿載軍需品之載重汽車輸送隊，經密芝那于三日抵達昆明郊外，而於翌日進入該市。據合衆社駐昆明特派員四日電報稱，該輸送隊因中途受日軍航空部隊之襲擊，備極困難，自印度之鐵道，經過斯蒂威爾公路而抵達昆明之中印最初汽車輸送隊，于中途曾兩次受日軍航空隊之威脅</p>
<h3>蕪商會贈金慰勞軍警</h3>
<p>蕪湖七日中央社電　蕪總商會爲慰勞駐在軍警，自動贈金一百萬元，該款昨已呈送淸鄉專署代爲分配。</p>

<h3>首都平價維記會　捕獲勒索犯　主犯一名已執行槍决</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　首都物資平價維紀委員會督察組自展開工作以來，連日破獲妨害物資供求關係者多起，日前又捕獲取勒民財犯人洪宗炎·薛元龍·鄭廣才·黃世玉·陳進發·李紀發等六名。綠洪在驚衛第二師通訊隊充任少尉排長，餘犯均在該隊當士兵，駐防雙閘，不時攔截運貨船夫，勒取財款。該案該會軍法組節易軍法會審判，决將洪宗炎判處死刑，薛鄭三犯判處徒刑十年，褫奪公權終身，餘犯無罪。至洪犯於七日下午三時由首都驚備司令部解押至中華門外雨花台塲，騐明正身，執行槍决。</p>
<h3>滿李大使　昨謁陸致敬</h3>

<p>南京七日央社電　司法行政部吳部長於七日上午十時，偕同孔次長分赴首都高等法院，首都高等檢察署，曁所屬地院，在檢署視察對院署方面辦案情形，垂詢頗詳，並向地院署全體職員訓話，語多勗勉。</p>
<h3>蘇軍渡沃特河　戰事達最高潮　波森展開激烈市街戰</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　東綫蘇軍仍繼續强力之攻勢，但德軍抵抗亦極熾烈，戰局已達最高潮。蘇軍以大軍集沃特及西里西亞，策動前進，五日渡沃特河，傳已獲得福斯登及法蘭克福南方十五公里地點之兩處橋頭堡。拉的波爾及格羅高方面，戰局無大動態。布利格及斯達勞方面刻正展開大規模機動戰。一方面蘇軍五日向波森市中心深入成功，現兩重續行激烈之街市戰。波美拉尼亞南方及布羅雷西部之蘇軍攻勢，無何等成果。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：軍事發言人稱，東綫沃特河綫之蘇軍攻勞趨於停頓後，戰事多爲從事於建立或消滅橋頭堡之戰。沃特河西岸之蘇橋頭堡多處，均爲德軍强迫縮小，然較前擴大者亦未始未有，如布利格東南之橋頭堡已向西北略見伸展。庫斯特林及法蘭克福之戰，仍未滅其嚴重性，尤以法蘭克福南弗爾斯丹堡附近之蘇軍兩大橋頭堡，頗具威脅性。惟德軍之反攻亦已逐漸見效，庫斯特林迤南有一小橋頭堡爲我肅淸。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊，狄特至中將昨廣播稱：沃特河今已爲德國命運所繫之河流，蘇軍前鋒抵沃特河第，即逐漸停頓，惟俟大軍抵達後，劇戰即將再起。蘇軍先鋒主力仍以法蘭克福及庫斯特林，亦即以柏林爲目標。波美拉尼亞方面之攻輦。地區雖廣，然其中心點則爲沃特河口，目的在切斷德國內地與西善魯士之陸上運絡，該方面蘇軍攻勢之趨，自爲極重要之事件，敵人今方積極增援，以待新攻勢之發動。德軍當局反措施宜面面顧到，不可因操之過急，反爲敵人覓得弱點。</p>
<h3>國際工會大會　在倫敦開幕</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦消息：最重要民最有意義之一，即世界工會會議，昨在倫敦啓幕，由代表約二百四十人，代表工人五千萬名出席會議。英國工會主席伊薩克斯，被選爲三次會議之一之主席，渠稱，目下應努力於重建大規模之工會運動，工會除非能覓得一種建設性之政策，否則人類之前途甚爲黑暗。</p>
<h3>戰爭的製造者　不配侈談和平　德方評論三國會議</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：德情報處長逖特里樞博士昨招待外國記者，評論在黑海附近某處舉行之三國會議，否認反軸心國有資格可賜予和平予世界。渠稱羅斯福邱吉爾及斯達林，此自命爲世界道德領袖，在此次會議中有二大目的：　欲　誘德國人民投降，　欲發表一種諾言，爲人類奠定和平之綦礎。在過去數年間，欲勸德人投降已吿失敗，於是乃進行自毀政策，此次亦將歸於失敗。關於反軸心國應許組織全球之和平一屑，狄氏稱，該三人是否有賜予世界和平之權，令人懷疑。</p>
<h3>動人理想　蘊藏戰爭媒介</h3>
<p>關於國際會社。集體安全。及世界團體，此僅爲對將來之一種美麗理想動人宗旨及諾言耳，其寶內部藏有戰爭之媒介，對於和平毫無保障，不可分裂之和平理論，乃第二次世界大戰之導火綫，同樣之危險今日依然存在，且規模更大。今日在三國會議之資本主義及布爾雪維克主義之代表，决不能視爲永久和平之健將，因其隠藏戰爭之媒旭，且時常爲醖釀戰爭之中心。今日會議代表所爭取之目的，非爲世界和平而爲永久之戰爭，一九三九年彼等所談者，爲一種不可分離之和平，而所產生者爲全面戰爭。</p>
<h3>野心不泯　和平終於難期</h3>
<p>倘彼等眞欲和平，則羅邱斯三人若認識對於全人類之責任，應消滅國際社會中戰爭之份子，始能達到世界之和平。惟有美國放棄挑撥戰爭之經濟帝國主義，始能獲致「地上和平」，英國歸還被壓迫大小各國之自由及主權，如印度阿拉伯民族，始能達到世界和平。倘資本主義及布爾雪維克奴隸制度消滅，永久和平始有可能。在財閥及經濟特殊階級消滅之後，同時提高工人及國家之地位，世界和平始有可能。布爾雪維克者，破壞國家之恐怖行爲及征服世界之野心未泯，和平公約乃令人失望耳。在世人未聞此種和平文吿之前，世界將被和平所出賣</p>
<h3>德潛艇新設備</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　海通社訊，論敦「每日電聞」載稱：德潛艇在技術上予以改進後人，今恢復其有力之攻繫活動，德潛艇今裝有一種新設備，在潛入水中之後，引擎仍能開動，且能在燃料限度之內，長期留在水中，故其作戰威力頗堪注意</p>
<h3>德國製造　超流星彈　用以攻繫美本土</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　德國當局鑒於戰局之緊迫，特嚴命軍民死守首都，微底抗戰，同時對更號兵器之報復攻繫，亦V加退化。前曾由中立兩方圖報吿V3號之發動消息，茲英國每日快報於一月二十六日復就預備中之V4號內情，戴稱，德軍揚嘗可直接攻繫紐約之新兵路超流星彈V4號，已進入生產階段，據法明V號兵器之德國技師謂，進攻大西洋　西岸之準備　已吿完成。該技師最近該問瑞典時稱，V4號較V3號之速力爲儘，重約十五噸，時速二十九公里，高達一九〇公里以上，唯邇來緊迫，故不能大量生產，至於繫紐約或受有相當限制，德國對歐洲不使用V4號之原因，乃在至最後關頭，即以之開始攻繫美國各都市也。</p>
<h3>英駐渝參贊　由海斯繼任</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　德國社訊，重慶消息：駐渝英大使館軍事參贊，兼駐渝英軍事代表團司令格林斯台爾少將，不久將離任返英，其繼任人選將爲數日前抵渝之海斯少將。</p>
<h3>希臘重開　和平談判</h3>
<p>日內瓦七日中央社電　據德國社訊，雅典消息：希臘政府與左靈黨之和平談判，因左翼要求特赦而破裂。茲已於星期二重復開始。希臘外長索菲亞諾普洛斯於離會議之前稱，渠認爲談判將於今後數日內結束。</p>
<h3>爭奪西綫要塞　入决戰階段</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　西綫美第一軍繼續排除德軍猛烈抵抗，屢以精銳部隊攻繫，六日已進入距沙馬東方休來顚蓋明德一公里之地，齊格斐線已入於要塞決戰階段。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍發言人昨稱：西線之希尼伊斐爾乃上亞爾薩斯區戰事，雖日見激烈，然而反軸心軍之總攻勢，猶不得謂已發動。目前敵軍之行動，不過在取得總攻時有利之出發點而已。然料去總攻發動之期黨不甚遠，蓋艾森霍華之目的，乃在呼應蘇軍之攻勢也。</p>
<h3>敵美的軍需生產　飛機槍械坦克生產指數慘跌　美人惑於虛僞宣傳民心厭戰</h3>
<p>爲了國內的矛盾重重，美國戰時生產局以前曾再行改變重需生產，因此自開戰以來早已禁止生產的一部民需生產工塲，又行開放，准許生產日用品。但至一九四年十二月初旬，全美國一百零三個主要軍需生產區曾宣佈，在今後三個月內不准軍需產業有改業行爲，同時進而宣佈所有民需生產，無限停止。這樣作仍嫌不够，所以於十二月十七日，頒佈非常緊急法令，凡軍隊中服務的熱練工人，暫時免役，派往軍需工塲從事生產。美國當局曾大吹大擂地說：「美國的决戰體制，是保證協約國勝利的主要因素」，話旣如此說，爲何手忙脚亂，眞令人百思莫解。如仔細觀察一下美國最近的生產力發展過程，以及美國人民因世界戰局變化而信念動搖等情形，則可瞭指掌。大家都知道，美國自從眞珠灣事件後曾積極從事軍需生產的擴充，其軍需生產的速度一度上昇，直至一九四三年底，曾達到最高的水凖。（根據美國準備局發表，以一九三五十三九年爲標準）</p>
<p>綜合生　軍需生　民需生</p>
<p>產指數　產指數　產指數</p>
<p>一九四一年　一六二　三二　一三一</p>
<p>一九四二年　一八九　一〇七　九二</p>
<p>一九四三年　二三九　一九五　八四</p>
<p>虛僞宣傳　反軸心國戰力源泉的美國軍需生產，旣然這樣迅速地突飛猛進着，又加上一九四三年北非作戰以來，接着意大利的叛亂。於是美國人民在美國當局的粉飾宣傳下，沉醉於勝利的迷夢裏了。就是說，生產順利，戰局好轉，結論就很明顯，戰爭可在短期內結束，差不多已成了美國普通人的口頭禪了。到了一九四四年，這種樂觀情緒，更加成爲不可動搖的成見了。因爲六月初旬聯合國大軍在北法登陸，七月二十日暗殺希特勒總統未遂事件的爆發等不利於軸心國的現象所致。同時，羅斯福爲競選而八月中旬特許軍需工廠改業的命令，以及接二連三所召集的戰後聯合國各種國際會議，便像對本國人民注射了過多的藥針一樣，不僅不發生效力，而且感覺不靈敏了。國民對於戰爭前途的樂情觀緒，不斷地被煽動着。於是一般國民並不再擔心戰爭的前途，而在關注戰後的保障了，在美國的宣傳政策下，這自然也是無可厚非的事。</p>
<p>人工驟減</p>
<p>所以爲避免改業期間發生失業危險，軍需工業職工就繼續不斷向各種民需工業轉職。在一九四三年中期，這種轉職情形登峰造極。軍需工業的工人數目以及工作時間，到了一九四四年，就急劇減少，三月份在業工人數目，業已回到一九四二年二月時的水準；而工作時間，也低落到一九四二年十一月的水準。從三月以後，生產指數一直下降着。這樣軍需產業以及一般工業領域內的人工不足，於是美國工業生產力，自從一九四三年十一月造成開戰以來的最高記錄後，立刻就開倒車向後轉了。一九四四年的夏秋之間，是一九四三年三月以來生產最低的時期。試看飛機生產的數字（戰時生產局發表），自從一九四三年達到頂點後，就逐漸低落了。</p>
<p>一九四三年一月　一·〇〇〇</p>
<p>同　三月　六·〇〇〇</p>
<p>同　六月　七·〇〇〇</p>
<p>同　九月　七·五九八</p>
<p>同　十二月　八·八〇二</p>
<p>一九四四年一月　八·七八九</p>
<p>同　八月　七·九三九</p>
<p>同　十月　上·　二九</p>
<p>同　十一月　六·七四七</p>
<p>飛機生產架數减少，或許因爲重心改爲B二九型和B三二型等重轟炸機的生產上了，但這也不盡然，請看生產重量也可以證明這一點。</p>
<p>（以萬磅爲單位）</p>
<p>一九四四年五月　八·九八〇</p>
<p>同　八月　七·九七〇</p>
<p>同　九月　七·八九〇</p>
<p>此外船舶生產以及各種彈藥生產等指數，雖然扶搖直上，而比一九四三年的生產提高了，但至於槍械以及坦克和汽車，則一九四四年夏天的成績，降低到一四三年的八成。</p>
<p>按戰時動員局長官潘恩資的聲明，目前美國最感不足者，就是重轟炸機，重火器及其彈藥，大型戴重汽車，攻繫運輸船以及登陸舟艇等。其中關於重火器用彈藥，爲生產一九四四年度所必要的數量，則十一月十二月的生產量，必須提高到十月的一倍半</p>
<p>事與願違</p>
<p>美國的海外派遺兵力，陸海兩軍一共增加到六萬了，一九四四年底，據人推測可達七百五十萬。這批大兵所需要的補充量，按美國陸海軍當局的談話，在歐洲一名兵士一個月需要一噸，在太平洋則一名兵士一個月需要八噸。由此看來，也可以知道是需要如何巨大的運輸力和物資。</p>
<p>試觀美國目前的東西兩大戰塲，羅斯福一方面在遭受着自己鼓動起來的人民樂觀情緒之逼迫—換言之，就是由士氣的鬆懈而變爲厭戰—另一方面則深慮聯合國陣營內部的分裂。所以羅斯福無論如何不得不圖早日結束戰爭，以致一九四四年夏天以來曾發動了幾許勉强的戰爭。然而結果，則適得其反，無論太平洋戰爭，也無論歐洲戰爭，前途都不容許樂觀，艱苦的事實，業已明顯地說明一切了。</p>
<p>因此，美國一九四四年與一九四三年底不同，戰爭儘管不知將繼續到多久，但民心却早已跳出戰火，而在作戰後享樂的美夢。從這一點看來，美國的戰爭憶經不能靠同仇敵愾的民心和士氣了。然而唯一可靠的大量物資，現在也陷於絕境了。請看羅斯福等戰爭指導者，最近天天喧嚷增加生產，擴大節約，這就是證明美國武器與彈葉等生產之不足。（林譯自十二月二十五日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>新協滬分會　送迎兩大尉　昨舉行茶會情緒熱烈</h3>
<p>盟邦日本艦隊報道部鹽田大尉，此次奉命榮轉要職，即將返國。中國新聞協會上海區分會，以鹽田氏在滬歷時二載有餘，於我新聞界之協力貢獻至多，今次歸國榮轉，不勝惜別。爰特於昨（七）日下午四時半假華懋飯店舉行茶會，以表歡送。同時並歡迎新任松本大尉。松島報道部長亦躬親出席參加，茶會情緒至爲熱烈。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>濟濟一堂</p>
<p>松島報道部長準時偕同鹽田大尉松本大尉蒞會，並到艦隊報道部囑託林俊夫·坂爪精一郞·秋田·王炳南·劉鎭南等，及日本陸軍報道部小池囑託·上海特別市劉宣傳處長（朱專員代），中國新聞協會赤星·櫻井·上海區分會理事長陳彬龢適因出席上海市民福利協會重要會議不及蒞會，特派代表宣讀歡送詞。區分會常務理事尾坂與市（日高淸磨瑳代），許力求·金雄白（陸光杰代）·黃敬齋（朱永康代）·陳日平·袁殊（翁永淸代）·森山喬·張昭銘等，曁理事總幹事魯風等氏，以及各報社代表等不下二百餘人，濟濟一堂。</p>
<p>陳日平詞</p>
<p>首由常務理事陳日平主席致詞云：諸位先生，今天新聞協會在這裏舉行茶會，一方面歡送鹽田大尉的榮轉，一方面是歡迎松本大尉的到任，所以這個茶會實際上包含了雙重的意義。</p>
<p>鹽田大尉在職二年有八個月，在大東亞作戰的緊張局面下，協助松島部長擔任宣傳報道的重責，貢獻極大，對於鹽田大尉的勞苦功高，這是本人要代表新聞協會及上海全市市民深深致謝的。</p>
<p>其次，因爲鹽田大尉担任的是宣傳報導的職務，所以和本市各文化機關，特別是和我們報界，幾乎是日常保持了密切接觸。在兩年多的時間中，無論在新聞報道方面或是在業務的推進上，鹽田大尉所給予的帮助實在非常之大的，這是我們整個上海新聞界所應該同聲感謝的。以上二點，都是就公的方面說。就私的方面說，鹽田大尉同我們新聞界中人在長時間來的接觸中，都保持了良好的關係，親熱的感情，所以當我們正股切期待鹽田大尉，需要他更多指導和更多帮助的時候，現在忽然聽到他要離職返國了，這實在是我們上海新聞界的一個損失。所以從公私兩方面講，難免使我們感覺到悵惘和惋惜。不過此次鹽田大尉榮轉，是離開上海去担任更重要的職務，和我們雖然暫作分別，可是站在整個東亞的立塲上來看，鹽田大尉今後所負的使命，以及所盡的責任，成果還是相等的。</p>
<p>我們對於鹽田大尉離去上海，總不免有惆悵之感，惟希鹽田大尉今後仍能時時以上海的新聞界爲念，俾人雖兩地相處，而仍能和我們保持一種精神上的接觸。</p>
<p>繼鹽田大尉任的，是我們現在同時所歡迎的松本大尉，聽說松本大尉，早年曾在東京帝國大學專攻法律經濟，學識修資兩俱豐富，今後在上海肩負艦隊報道部宣傳指導任務，必將有　的貢獻，這是我們深爲慶幸的。我們相信松本大尉運用其才幹與學識，今後一定能够繼鹽田大尉之後，給我們新聞界以各方面的指示和帮助</p>
<p>陳彬龢詞</p>
<p>繼由中國新聞協會上海區分會理事長陳彬龢致詞云：（即席委託代表宣讀）鹽田大尉，松本大尉，諸位來賓：今天我們歡送鹽田大尉，同時歡迎松本大尉，承蒙光臨，很爲榮幸。我同鹽田大尉相識兩年有餘，因爲申報是海軍管理的，所以爲了職務上的關係，個人與鹽田大尉接觸的機會很多。從公的立塲而言，我的感想可以公開的說，是中日合作事業中的模範，在公務上，我同鹽田大尉的意見，大多數是相同的，雖有少數意見不同的地方，都能够開誠的懇談，總會得到很圓滿的諒解。所以，我們一切的工作，都自動的做，不曾受到什麼意外的干涉，所以我說是中日合作事業的模範。兩年以來，我們只談公事，不談私事，可是私交也極好。我對鹽田大尉最欽佩的有兩點：第一，他辦事的認眞與　　，我們常常早晨八點鐘就有事接洽，灤夜十二點時亦然，沒有星期例假，這是他勤勞的精神。他是一個靑年，一般的說，靑年是愛美觀的，鹽田大尉雖然也愛美觀，可是有時忙的時候，鬚鬚很長了，還不修剪，襪十背面破了，皮鞋面破了，他依舊穿用，大衣偷去了，沒有錢買新的，就以精神禦寒，這種種都是勤勞工作的精神表現，值得佩服的。有一次，有一位在中國機關服務的日本朋友，他問我中國方面怎樣期待日本人在中國的工作精神？我就答復他說：希望日本朋友無論在中國機關日本機關服務的，都能發生模範作用。那末，鹽田先生就是代表者。第二，他對於中國問題有深切了解，而且對於中國靑年，更具有熱情。現在鹽田大尉將調任離滬，由松本大尉通任，我們相信松本大尉必能與鹽田大尉同樣的認眞與熱情。最後我個人對於鹽田大尉的離滬，無論從公誼言，私交言，都有非常的依依惜別之意。料想在座同人，也有同樣的感覺，敬祝鹽田大尉前程遠大，身體健康，松本大尉，身體健康。</p>
<p>松島致詞</p>
<p>旋由松島報道部長致詞，略謂：今天承蒙上海新聞界諸君舉行盛大茶會，歡送鹽田大尉，歡迎松本大尉，本人參與盛會，表示謝忱。過去二年八個月中間，鹽田大尉對於戰時下的宣傳報道工作，可說已經盡了百分之百的能力。以往的新聞聯合會，現在的新聞協會，與我們之間，猶之宇宙以內的太陽和月光。這個意思是說，本人是微弱的月光，鹽田大尉是光輝四射的太陽，新聞協會則爲大宇宙。過去宣傳報道工作，在報道部方面如果可說有成績的話，那末，這都是太陽的光輝，與大宇宙的包含。鹽田大尉雖在本人部下，可是他是極優秀的幹才，這次調任，本人實在覺得惜別，中國新聞協會以至上海區分會的成立，鹽田大尉會有許多助力，現在協會正在開始工作推進的時候，鹽田大尉即將調任，相信諸位也覺得惜別。現在幸得松本大尉繼任，他也有很豐富的學識，對於中日親善，尤具信心，所以，希望諸位以協助鹽田大尉的熱忱，同樣協助松本大尉。現在戰局雖移向呂宋島，馬尼刺正進行基地戰，可是並不悲觀，反而越發有利。我在上月回返日本，親目所見的，都是决戰態勢的完備。回來後愈益堅定信念。今後决戰，局部地區得失，並不重要，而决戰勝利的最要關鍵，全在中日兩國的眞正協力。</p>
<p>鹽田答詞</p>
<p>最後由鹽田大尉致答謝詞，略謂：「今天承蒙新聞協會招待，非常欣慰，非常感激，一方面因爲離開上海，與諸位分別，所以，精神上感覺很沉悶。本人來到上海服務時，適在大東亞戰爭發生後四個月，這時候上海新聞界與海軍方面很少聯繫，到目前有了這樣的聯繫，這中間的經過，本人都知道，都參加，因此，又很覺得欣慰。現在本人雖將和很熟悉的上海以及中國朋友離開，但總有機會再度來此，希望諸位繼續努力與活躍。方才承蒙部長過分誇獎，實不敢當。好在松本大尉，具有超等的優秀能力，敬盼諸位仍以松島部長爲中心，繼續與報道部協力，爲中日共同前途對敵人展開大攻勢。」右：松本大尉　中：松島大佐　左：鹽田大尉（康祖藝攝）</p>

<h3>Japanese Main Force Units on Standby, Adopting Encirclement Tactics: Fierce Fighting Intensifies Across Luzon Island</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Battles are intensifying daily across Luzon Island. Japanese forces in the central plains of Luzon are currently engaged in fierce fighting with enemy units advancing southward. Bayonet combat continues in the Clark Field area, preventing the enemy's advance. Near Shirousagi Bridge, eight kilometers north of Maromelet in northern Manila, Japanese forces ambushed two battalions of the advancing enemy, destroying over twenty military trucks and killing approximately one hundred enemy soldiers. Fierce fighting continues. In the Moni area, an enemy division launched an offensive on the 3rd under heavy artillery cover but was repelled by Japanese forces. In the northeast, near San Jose, two companies of enemy artillery, two companies of fifteen anti-aircraft guns, one company of ten anti-aircraft guns, one mortar company, twenty tanks, and one infantry regiment were all repelled by Japanese commando units. Additionally, in the Puto Gang Monides area, between the 1st and 3rd, the enemy suffered nine hundred casualties. Simultaneously, Japanese forces destroyed eight tanks, twenty-eight trucks, ten prime movers, eight self-propelled guns, eight mortars, and five rapid-fire guns. Furthermore, they captured five heavy machine guns, twenty-two automatic rifles, and two wireless radios. In the southern Manila area, enemy forces attempted to advance eastward from Nasugbu, but were stopped fifteen kilometers east of the town. Japanese main force units are currently suppressing the enemy's rear and flanks, awaiting an opportunity to encircle them. The enemy is significantly reinforcing their positions, making the situation on the Philippine Islands increasingly complex.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – On the 3rd, enemy forces on Luzon Island infiltrated the northern part of Manila City with tanks and armored vehicles. Simultaneously, airborne troops landed at Karookan Airport, north of the city, engaging in fierce combat with Japanese forces stationed near Santo Tomas University and Far Eastern University. Near Santo Tomas University, enemy forces on the north bank of the Sizuku River heavily shelled Japanese positions on the south bank, with flames reaching the sky.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the Philippine Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy forces in the Clark Field area continued to shell Japanese positions on the 6th and were constructing positions in front of the Japanese lines. Currently, Japanese forces are conducting nightly raids. As of the 6th, they had shot down twenty-two enemy aircraft, destroyed seven tanks and over ten other vehicles, captured numerous machine guns and mortars, and killed many enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>Japanese Night Raids Yield Results</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the Luzon Front, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Eager to retake Manila, the enemy has formed its offensive line into a semicircle, launching repeated attacks on the periphery of Manila regardless of cost. Part of their forces has infiltrated the city. Enemy forces at the northern entrance to Nasugbu have begun a general offensive against Japanese positions near Ayaka. Japanese forces, defending steep mountainous terrain, are preventing their advance. To break this stalemate, the enemy landed paratroopers near Ayaka and Tagaytay to reinforce their rear. However, they suffered heavy losses in a surprise attack by Japanese forces in the area. In the northern Bataan Peninsula, enemy forces encountered a Japanese counterattack at the eastern entrance to Subic and are currently stalled. The main force of enemy troops advancing southward from San Fernando infiltrated the Marololos area, attempting to cross the Banbanga River. They launched fierce attacks against Japanese forces defending the river line, but were repeatedly repelled, and fierce fighting continues. In Santa Maria, east of Marololos, some enemy armored units infiltrated from the north. Japanese forces immediately engaged in fierce close combat, killing over one hundred and fifty enemy soldiers and destroying over thirty tanks and armored vehicles. The assault continues. On the night of the 4th, over one hundred enemy cargo trucks, fully loaded with soldiers, were moving near Santa Maria when they were subjected to heavy shelling by Japanese artillery units, which repelled them. Enemy forces, desperately attempting to invade Manila with some forces of the American-Philippine military, infiltrated Manila City on the dark night of the 3rd. Japanese garrison troops bravely intercepted them, inflicting annihilating blows. At the same time, the enemy incited guerrilla units to infiltrate near Manila, starting fires everywhere and using bombs to destroy key bridges spanning the Shigge River in the heart of the city. On the 4th, fires broke out in various parts of the city, threatening to sacrifice the entire city of Manila to the cruelty and barbarity of the American forces. As a result, the citizens of the Philippines are extremely indignant. Meanwhile, enemy forces advancing eastward from the Luzon Plain to invade Monides, after intense shelling with considerable artillery and infantry forces, began pressing their infantry attack. However, Japanese forces, defending unfavorable flat terrain, fought fiercely, repeatedly repelling the invading enemy. While enduring enemy shelling, they quickly shifted from defense to offense at night. From the 2nd to the 3rd, their gains included the destruction of six M4 tanks, one armored vehicle, two artillery pieces, two mortars, the shooting down of one fighter plane, and the killing or wounding of over five hundred personnel. At the Dammol Dies base on the north side of the enemy bridgehead in Lingayen Gulf, the enemy continues to strengthen their defensive positions. Naval gun fire from within Lingayen Gulf continues. The enemy has not advanced, and the front line has seen little change in the past week.</p>
<h3>Status of Japanese Troops on Various Pacific Islands</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The United Press International frontline correspondent from the Omiya Island base reported on the 5th the following status of Japanese troops on various islands in the Pacific, both at the front and in the rear, in previous battles: The remaining Japanese units on various Pacific islands are well-armed and well-fed. According to reconnaissance reports, Japanese soldiers appear healthy and are using secretly imported excellent equipment. Their food and vegetables are self-sufficiently produced.</p>
<h3>High Morale Among Japanese Troops in Rabaul</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In the Rabaul area, there were 411 enemy aircraft raids in January. In the Albu Bay and Outer Albu Bay areas, 22 enemy aircraft raided on the 1st. Enemy aircraft are slightly more active in this area. Australia has recently been frequently coordinating with operations in the Southeast, suggesting a planned attack on Rabaul. Japanese air reconnaissance of the north and south coasts of New Britain Island found no enemy ships entering or leaving, and no signs of airfield use. The enemy's alleged new offensive in the Southeast is nothing more than propaganda. In any case, regardless of the enemy's plans, the morale of Japanese units in the Rabaul area is increasing, and the enemy's offensive will surely be crushed.</p>
<h3>Promoting Production Awareness, Strengthening Transportation Capacity: Contents of Japan's New Economic Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – China's economy is of major importance to Japan's war effort. Japan has provided various forms of assistance to ensure China's economic stability. Shigemitsu, Minister of Greater East Asia, declared at the opening of this parliamentary session in the House of Representatives that Japan has proposed a new economic policy towards China to address the urgent need to improve the Chinese economy and is strongly promoting its implementation. In addition, questions have been raised by members of both houses of parliament, and the full picture of Japan's new economic policy has gradually become clear. The main points of its specific measures are as follows: (1) Establish a comprehensive guidance organization to implement the new policy locally. This new organization will be divided into the following two stages: A. The supreme guidance organization, composed of the ambassador to China, the commander-in-chief of the general army, and the commander of the fleet. This organization has the power to decide on the promotion of the new measures. B. Establish local promotion organizations, currently located at the embassy offices in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, serving as the centers for North China, Central China, South China, and Mengjiang (Zhangjiakou), respectively. These new organizations will be composed of the office director, minister, and representatives of the army and navy. (2) Unify material procurement plans. The procurement of materials will be carried out under a unified plan to improve coordination efficiency and avoid duplicate purchases. (3) Strengthen local transportation capacity. In addition to strengthening the transportation capacity of the North China and Central China railways, establish a procurement plan for inclusive transportation capacity to coordinate land and sea transportation capacity between Japan and the local area, in order to avoid material stagnation. (4) Maintain and cultivate the Chinese economy. Promote production awareness and improvement efforts in China to increase the production of food, daily necessities, coal, etc., and strive to restore local light industry. In addition, mobilize sailing ships, etc., to strengthen transportation capacity. (5) Support the existing currency system. The economic situation of Chinese currency appears to be somewhat inflated on the surface, but the Federal Reserve Bank of China notes and reserve certificates will be consistently supported. At the same time, adjustments to currency issuance, the recovery of remittances, and the adjustment of local funds are gradually being implemented. (6) Revitalize the economic activities of Japanese people in the local area. Urge the North China Development Company, the Central China Promotion Company, and various Japanese trading companies to recognize the fundamental spirit of the new policy in order to operate their businesses in a spirit of good neighborliness. Regarding the above new economic policy, a full agreement was reached at the meeting of the directors of the embassy offices in China in mid-December of last year, and was subsequently decided by the cabinet.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reaffirming Public Interest Over Private Gain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association convened leaders of various trade associations to jointly discuss raising funds for winter relief and donations to the military and police, resulting in a successful outcome (news reported on page 3 of today's newspaper). Observing the proceedings of this meeting, we have the following reflections:</p>
<p>First, the purpose of this meeting was entirely for the public good of Shanghai society, in response to Mayor Zhou's expectation that Shanghai citizens prioritize "public interest over private gain, society before the individual." In yesterday's editorial, we stated: "In the past, everyone unanimously condemned the extortionate behavior of the police. This behavior has now been eliminated as a result of the authorities' efforts to rectify discipline and improve treatment. From the perspective of us citizens, we should also show support for the government and encouragement for the military and police. Whether this suggestion can be realized can be seen as a litmus test for whether members of society can shift their character and prioritize public interest over private gain." According to the results of yesterday's meeting of the Citizens' Welfare Association, the enthusiasm shown by leaders from all sectors of society and the emphasis on public interest are cause for great rejoicing.</p>
<p>Second, the focus of the meeting was on how to allocate donations and how to provide advance loans. Leaders of various industries were able to enthusiastically pledge donations and advance loans. In particular, Mr. Zhan Peilin individually pledged one million yuan, Mr. Xu Guanqun individually pledged one million yuan in advance loans, and Mr. Zhang Baocun pledged one million yuan on behalf of his industry. We believe that wealthy businessmen with ample resources, such as Messrs. Zhan and Xu, are by no means few in the Shanghai area. We hope that they will spontaneously rise up with enthusiasm to prioritize public interest over private gain.</p>
<p>Third, the banking industry is the mainstay of the financial world. Although the banking business has not been as prosperous and profitable as the rising industries in recent years, the leaders of the banking industry are all people of status and prestige in society, so they rightly retain their leading position. In particular, the China and Transportation Banks have always been prudent and stable in their business operations. In fact, in the current economic society, if the sole purpose is to make money, it is relatively difficult to adapt to the environment, and several long-established banks are known as the hidden poor in the banking industry. However, for the sake of public interest, Mr. Tang Shoumin was particularly enthusiastic in undertaking a large amount of advance lending, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>Fourth, of the 130-plus industry association leaders invited, only 30-plus attended, accounting for only one-quarter. The fact that the majority of industry association leaders avoided attending is regrettable. Although some explained their reasons for being unable to attend, there were still some who neither delegated representatives nor explained their reasons for non-attendance, which is frankly a wait-and-see attitude. Strictly speaking, these people are selfish and unable to achieve "public interest over private gain, society before the individual." However, although they avoid attending, they cannot shirk the responsibilities that society imposes on them. Now that the allocation units have been decided, they can no longer maintain a wait-and-see attitude. From the standpoint of the media, we are willing to offer a warning and hope that they will quickly take on their responsibilities and not be regarded with contempt by society.</p>
<p>Fifth, the industry associations invited by the Welfare Association do not include all industries and businesses in the city. Many associations were omitted and therefore do not have a donation responsibility. However, we hope that all industry associations that have not been assigned will voluntarily make donations and jointly shoulder their due responsibilities, and not assume that they are exempt from responsibility simply because they have not been assigned. Only with a spirit of "public interest first" can the preservation of "private gain" be stabilized.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that the purpose and successful outcome of this gathering is a rare and significant event with far-reaching implications. It also proves that the spirit of "public interest over private gain, society before the individual" can still be revived among leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. However, we in the media will unanimously urge and then sanction the few remaining wait-and-see elements in order to create the good atmosphere that Mayor Zhou expects of us.</p>
<h3>Japanese Decision on Decisive Battle Production Establishment Guidelines Approved</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japan's financial circles, recognizing the importance of various situations under the current state of affairs for overcoming the crisis, firmly believe that the original plans alone cannot solve the current difficulties. Since last winter, the results of discussions at the Important Industry Council and other gatherings have led to the final adoption of the Decisive Battle Production Establishment Guidelines at the Important Coordination Council on the 5th of this month. In addition, Ryozou, Eizō Nagasaki, and Saburō Chiba, three councilors of the Comprehensive Planning Bureau who came from financial circles, also conducted separate reviews on this matter, and their ideals are similar. Recently, the financial circles have also submitted opinions to the government and the army and navy authorities. In any case, the issue will unfold soon, and what the financial circles expect is a clear calculation of the minimum military demand targets for defense centering on the Philippines and the Japanese mainland. To achieve this goal, in the important industrial sectors of steel, iron, coal, oil, metals, aircraft, shipbuilding, and liquid fuels, establish powerful, unified operating organizations that can accommodate existing control associations and industrial associations. The government will grant these operating organizations the necessary powers for industrial operations, and local administrative authorities will be in a supervisory position. This will not only correct the unification of production rights, but also make it easier to complete emergency production.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers and House of Representatives Temporarily Adjourn</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the reopening of the Japanese parliament, deliberations have continued for days, and the deliberations in both houses are proceeding according to schedule. The House of Representatives will temporarily adjourn from the 8th, and the House of Peers from the 12th, in a state of readiness to respond to any eventuality.</p>
<h3>Japanese Hidesuke Yamamoto and Others Jointly Propose Strong Measures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Hidesuke Yamamoto, Tokutomi Sohō, Katsuo Yoshihisa, Matsunaga Hisao, Minagawa Haruhiro, Kurosawa Saizō, Shiōten Nobutaka, Kobayashi Junichi, Yokoo Sōzaburō and others believe that the way for Japan to overcome crises since its opening has been to dedicate the total strength of Japan's one hundred million people to war, and to unite the power of the government and the people to make strong policies with quick decisions, quick executions, and quick actions. On the 6th, they submitted to Prime Minister Koiso a ten-point concrete plan and a proposal for the urgent implementation of national policy, the gist of which is as follows: (1) The reason for all victory lies in quick decision and action. (2) The determination to fight to the death of the entire population of one hundred million should be thorough. (3) Wooden aircraft production should be urgently increased. (4) Important factories should be managed by the state, and labor management should be reformed radically at the same time. (5) Important military factories should be evacuated rapidly and thoroughly. (6) Thorough mobilization should be carried out immediately. (7) Middle school instruction should be suspended in principle, and education should be thoroughly implemented specifically for the cultivation of talent. (The rest omitted)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Confirms Loss of Nanxiong</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Have Advanced to Nan'an</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Reuters correspondent in Chongqing has acknowledged that Japanese troops, aiming to reduce the Ganjiang air base cluster, captured Nanxiong after the capture of Suichuan. His report on the 6th is as follows: Japanese troops occupied Nanxiong in Guangdong Province on the 3rd, so Chongqing lost another air base east of the Yuehan Railway.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Headquarters issued a battle report on the 16th stating that Japanese troops advancing eastward from Shaoguan, an important point on the Yuehan Railway, have now advanced to Nan'an (Dayu), an important silver mining area 95 kilometers northeast of the city, and are about to occupy the area.</p>
<h3>US Report Reveals Low Chongqing Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – It is reported here that the military, political, and economic departments under the Chongqing regime are all in a state of chaos, and the United States' hopes for Chongqing are also encountering various obstacles. The "Official Report on Chongqing" recently published by the US War Information Bureau in newspapers across the United States hints at the true situation described above, from which it can be seen that the United States is attempting to invade Chongqing. The main points of the report are as follows: After seven years of China's resistance war, 80% of its industry and railways have been lost. All roads except highways have been blocked, so imports have also been interrupted. According to Nelson's proposal, although countermeasures were discussed between Chongqing and the United States, the first things to be implemented must be an increase in imports by the United States, improvement of hinterland transportation organs, dispatch of American and American-trained technicians and workers to engage in industrial and transportation sector projects, and establishment of raw material and military production control bureaus and other institutions. Regarding transportation, due to a lack of trucks, reliance will have to be placed on large numbers of laborers and freight wagons in the future. 70% of the goods transported to Kunming are delayed for months due to the lack of complete local transportation facilities. At the second and third sessions of the People's Political Council, the CCP expressed dissenting opinions. Regarding other issues in Chongqing, such as the military warlords in various places not cooperating with Chongqing in the resistance war, this is a powerful obstacle to the united front in Chongqing. Aid to Chongqing based on the Lend-Lease Act has also had to be restricted due to the complicated situation in the hinterland of Chongqing, and the inconvenience of domestic transportation has further aggravated the difficulty. Chongqing has claimed to have completed more than 900 miles of highways last year, but they have been destroyed by Japanese military operations. The following three points were also pointed out regarding China's economic power: (1) Industrial zones, transportation organizations, and natural resources have all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. (2) The blockade of the coast restricts the entry of military supplies. (3) The government's economic control power is quite weak, and inflation in the hinterland is a major obstacle to production institutions. Nelson warned in his statement to the previous Political Council that Chongqing cannot win the production war and that the current situation in Chongqing is bound to darken, and that the people's production efforts are the key to Chongqing's victory or defeat.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Threatens Transportation in India, Myanmar, and Yunnan</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – After the opening of the Stilwell Road and the old Burma Road, a convoy of trucks loaded with military supplies from India arrived in the suburbs of Kunming on the 3rd via Myitkyina and entered the city the next day. According to a telegram from the United Press International correspondent in Kunming on the 4th, the convoy faced extreme difficulties due to attacks by Japanese air force units en route. The first motorcade from India's railway, passing through the Stilwell Road, and arriving in Kunming in China, was threatened by the Japanese air force twice en route.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Chamber of Commerce Donates Funds to Comfort the Military and Police</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce has voluntarily donated one million yuan to comfort the stationed military and police. The funds were submitted to the Qingxiang Special Office yesterday for distribution.</p>

<h3>Capital Price Stabilization Committee Arrests Extortionist: Mastermind Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since commencing operations, the Capital Material Price Stabilization Committee's inspection team has uncovered numerous cases of disrupting the supply and demand of materials. Recently, it arrested six criminals who extorted property from the people: Hong Zongyan, Xue Yuanlong, Zheng Guangcai, Huang Shiyu, Chen Jinfa, and Li Jifa. Hong served as a second lieutenant platoon leader in the communications team of the Second Garrison Division, and the remaining criminals were soldiers in the same team, stationed at Shuangzha, where they frequently intercepted cargo carriers and extorted money. The military law team of the committee easily conducted a military court trial of the case and decided to sentence Hong Zongyan to death, and Xue and Zheng to ten years of imprisonment, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The remaining criminals were acquitted. As for the Hong criminal, he was escorted by the Capital Garrison Headquarters to Yuhua Terrace outside Zhonghua Gate at 3 PM on the 7th, where his identity was verified and he was executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Ambassador Lee Pays Respects to Lu Chih-ching Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Lee Shao-keng, the newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Manchukuo to China, accompanied by Minister Miura and twelve other counselors, secretaries, and officers, visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 9:00 AM on the 7th to pay respects and offer flowers at the tomb of the Father of the Nation. Xu Yazhou, Director of the Department of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Section Chief Cheng of the Bureau of Protocol were specially dispatched to welcome them at the mausoleum. Subsequently, Ambassador Lee and his party, accompanied by Director Xu and Section Chief Cheng, proceeded to Plum Blossom Hill to pay respects at the tomb of Chairman Wang. At 11:00 AM, Ambassador Lee and his party visited the official residence of Acting Chairman Chen for a cordial discussion. Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu, Chief Secretary Zhou, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen were also present. The cordial discussion lasted for approximately an hour before they departed.</p>
<h3>Minister of Justice Wu Inspects the High Court</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister Wu of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, accompanied by Vice Minister Kong, visited the Capital High Court, the Capital High Procuratorate, and affiliated district courts at 10:00 AM on the 7th. He inquired in detail about the handling of cases at the procuratorate and the courts, and addressed all the staff of the district court with words of encouragement.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Cross the Oder River; Fighting Reaches a Climax; Fierce Street Battles Unfold in Poznan</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Soviet troops on the Eastern Front continue their strong offensive, but German resistance is also extremely fierce, and the battle has reached its climax. Soviet forces, with a large army concentrated on the Oder and Silesia, launched an advance, crossing the Oder River on the 5th and reportedly securing two bridgeheads at Fürstenberg and 15 kilometers south of Frankfurt. There are no major changes in the situation at Lauban and Glogau. Large-scale mobile warfare is currently unfolding in the areas of Brieg and Steinau. On the one hand, Soviet forces successfully penetrated the center of Poznan on the 5th, and fierce street battles are continuing. The Soviet offensive south of Pomerania and west of Bromberg has yielded no results.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: A military spokesman stated that after the Soviet offensive on the Oder River line on the Eastern Front tended to stall, the fighting mostly involved establishing or destroying bridgeheads. Many Soviet bridgeheads on the west bank of the Oder River have been forcibly reduced by German forces, but some have also expanded compared to before, such as the bridgehead southeast of Brieg, which has slightly extended to the northwest. The battles for Küstrin and Frankfurt have not diminished in their severity, especially the two major Soviet bridgeheads near Fürstenberg, south of Frankfurt, which are quite threatening. However, the German counter-offensive is gradually taking effect, and a small bridgehead south of Küstrin has been cleared by us.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: Lieutenant General Dittmar stated in a broadcast yesterday: The Oder River has now become a river upon which Germany's fate depends. The Soviet vanguard gradually stalled after reaching the Oder River, but fierce battles will resume after the main force arrives. The main force of the Soviet vanguard still aims at Frankfurt and Küstrin, that is, at Berlin. The offensive in the Pomeranian area, although wide, has its focal point at the mouth of the Oder River, aiming to cut off the land connection between the German interior and West Prussia. The trend of the Soviet offensive in that area is a very important event. The enemy is now actively reinforcing in preparation for launching a new offensive. The German authorities should take countermeasures in all respects and avoid being hasty, lest the enemy find weaknesses.</p>
<h3>International Trade Union Congress Opens in London</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports, London news: One of the most important and meaningful events, the World Trade Union Conference, opened in London yesterday, attended by approximately 240 delegates representing 50 million workers. British Trade Union Chairman Isaacs was elected chairman of one of the three meetings. He stated that efforts should now be focused on rebuilding a large-scale trade union movement, and that unless trade unions can find a constructive policy, the future of humanity is very bleak.</p>
<h3>Makers of War Not Fit to Lavishly Speak of Peace; German Commentary on the Three-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: Dr. Tietley, Director of the German Information Bureau, received foreign journalists yesterday and commented on the Three-Nation Conference held near the Black Sea, denying that the anti-Axis countries are qualified to bestow peace upon the world. He stated that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, who claim to be the moral leaders of the world, have two major goals in this conference: to induce the German people to surrender, and to issue a promise to lay the foundation for peace for mankind. In the past few years, attempts to persuade the Germans to surrender have failed, so they are pursuing a policy of self-destruction, which will also fail this time. Regarding the anti-Axis countries' promise to organize global peace, Dr. Dittmar said that it is doubtful whether the three have the right to bestow peace upon the world.</p>
<h3>Moving Ideals Conceal the Medium of War</h3>
<p>Regarding international societies, collective security, and world organizations, these are merely beautiful ideals, moving goals, and promises for the future. However, they conceal the medium of war and offer no guarantee of peace. The theory of indivisible peace was the fuse of World War II; the same danger still exists today, and on a larger scale. Today, the representatives of capitalism and Bolshevism at the Three-Nation Conference cannot be regarded as champions of lasting peace, because they harbor the seeds of war and are often centers of brewing war. The goal pursued by the conference delegates today is not world peace but perpetual war. In 1939, they spoke of an indivisible peace, and what resulted was total war.</p>
<h3>Ambition Unextinguished, Peace Ultimately Difficult to Expect</h3>
<p>If they truly desire peace, then Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin should recognize their responsibility to all of humanity and eliminate the elements of war in the international community in order to achieve world peace. Only when the United States abandons its war-provoking economic imperialism can "peace on earth" be achieved. Only when Britain returns freedom and sovereignty to the oppressed nations, large and small, such as India and the Arab peoples, can world peace be achieved. Lasting peace is possible only when capitalism and Bolshevik slavery are eliminated. World peace is possible only after the financial groups and economic special classes are eliminated, and the status of workers and the nation is elevated at the same time. The Bolsheviks, whose destructive terrorist acts against the nation and ambition to conquer the world have not been extinguished, render peace treaties disappointing. Until the world hears such a peace declaration, the world will be betrayed by peace.</p>
<h3>New German Submarine Equipment</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports: London's "Daily Telegraph" reports: After technically improving German submarines, they have now resumed their powerful offensive activities. German submarines are now equipped with new equipment that allows the engines to continue running after submerging and to remain submerged for a long period within the fuel limit, so their combat power is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Germany Manufactures Super Meteorite Bombs to Attack the American Mainland</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German authorities, in view of the urgency of the war situation, have strictly ordered the military and civilians to defend the capital to the death and resist to the end. At the same time, they are intensifying the retaliatory attacks with more advanced weapons. Previously, neutral parties reported the launch of the V3. Now, the British Daily Express reported on January 26 on the details of the V4 under preparation, stating that the German army is planning to directly attack New York with the new weapon, the Super Meteorite Bomb V4, which has entered the production stage. According to a German technician of the V-weapon, preparations for attacking the west coast of the Atlantic have been completed. The technician recently stated when visiting Sweden that the speed of the V4 is greater than that of the V3, weighing about fifteen tons, with a speed of twenty-nine kilometers per second, reaching an altitude of over 190 kilometers. However, due to the recent urgency, it cannot be mass-produced. As for attacking New York, there are considerable limitations. The reason Germany does not use the V4 against Europe is that, at the final juncture, it will begin attacking American cities with it.</p>
<h3>Hays Succeeds as British Military Attaché in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency reports, Chongqing news: Major General Grimstead, the military attaché of the British Embassy in Chongqing and commander of the British Military Mission in Chongqing, will soon leave office and return to Britain. His successor will be Major General Hays, who arrived in Chongqing a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Greece Reopens Peace Talks</h3>
<p>Geneva, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to the German News Agency, Athens news: Peace talks between the Greek government and the left-wing party broke down due to the left's demand for amnesty. They have now resumed on Tuesday. Greek Foreign Minister Sophianopoulos stated before leaving the meeting that he believes the negotiations will end in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Struggle for Key Western Front Fortresses Enters Decisive Phase</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The US First Army on the Western Front continues to overcome fierce German resistance, repeatedly attacking with elite troops, and on the 6th, it entered an area one kilometer east of Schaumern, Heyden, and Kempen. The Siegfried Line has entered the decisive phase of fortress warfare.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Havas Agency reports, A German military spokesman stated yesterday: Although the fighting at Higny-en-l'Haye in the Upper Alsace region on the Western Front is becoming increasingly fierce, the overall offensive of the anti-Axis forces cannot yet be said to have been launched. The current actions of the enemy are merely to gain favorable starting points for the general offensive. However, the date of the general offensive is not expected to be far off, as Eisenhower's goal is to echo the Soviet offensive.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Military Production; Aircraft, Gun, and Tank Production Indices Plummet; Americans Deceived by False Propaganda and Public Sentiment War-Weary</h3>
<p>Due to the many internal contradictions, the U.S. War Production Board had previously changed military production again. Therefore, some civilian production factories that had been banned from production since the start of the war were reopened and allowed to produce daily necessities. However, in early December 1944, all 103 major military production zones in the United States announced that military industries would not be allowed to change industries in the next three months. At the same time, they further announced that all civilian production would be suspended indefinitely. This was still not enough, so on December 17, an emergency decree was issued to temporarily exempt skilled workers serving in the military from military service and send them to military factories to engage in production. The U.S. authorities have boasted loudly: "The U.S. decisive battle system is the main factor guaranteeing the victory of the Allied powers." Since this is the case, why are they so flustered? It is truly puzzling. If we carefully observe the recent development process of U.S. productivity and the changes in the beliefs of the American people due to the changes in the world war situation, we can understand it clearly. Everyone knows that the U.S. has been actively expanding military production since the Pearl Harbor incident, and its speed of military production has risen sharply, reaching the highest level at the end of 1943. (According to the U.S. Preparedness Bureau's publication, taking 1935-1939 as the standard)</p>
<p>Combined Production Index, Military Production Index, Civilian Production Index</p>
<p>1941: 162, 32, 131</p>
<p>1942: 189, 107, 92</p>
<p>1943: 239, 195, 84</p>
<h3>False Propaganda</h3>
<p>Since the U.S. military production, the source of the anti-Axis countries' war power, has been making such rapid progress, coupled with the rebellion in Italy following the North African operation in 1943, the American people were intoxicated by the dream of victory under the embellished propaganda of the U.S. authorities. In other words, smooth production and improved war situation led to the obvious conclusion that the war could be ended in a short period of time, which had almost become a common saying among ordinary Americans. By 1944, this optimistic sentiment had become an unshakable prejudice, due to the landing of the Allied forces in northern France in early June and the outbreak of the assassination attempt on President Hitler on July 20, which were unfavorable to the Axis powers. At the same time, Roosevelt's order to allow military factories to change industries in mid-August for the election and the successive convening of various international postwar United Nations conferences were like injecting too many drugs into the people, which not only did not take effect but also made them feel insensitive. The people's optimistic attitude towards the future of the war was constantly being incited. Therefore, the general public no longer worried about the future of the war but focused on postwar security. This is naturally excusable under the U.S. propaganda policy.</p>
<h3>Sudden Drop in Labor</h3>
<p>Therefore, in order to avoid the risk of unemployment during the period of industry change, military industry workers continued to transfer to various civilian industries. In mid-1943, this transfer reached its peak. The number of workers in the military industry and working hours decreased sharply in 1944. The number of workers employed in March had returned to the level of February 1942, and the working hours had also fallen to the level of November 1942. Since March, the production index has been declining. This shortage of labor in the military industry and the general industrial field caused U.S. industrial productivity to immediately reverse and turn backward after creating the highest record since the start of the war in November 1943. The summer and autumn of 1944 were the lowest production periods since March 1943. Looking at the numbers of aircraft production (published by the War Production Board), it has gradually declined since reaching its peak in 1943.</p>
<p>January 1943: 1,000</p>
<p>March 1943: 6,000</p>
<p>June 1943: 7,000</p>
<p>September 1943: 7,598</p>
<p>December 1943: 8,802</p>
<p>January 1944: 8,789</p>
<p>August 1944: 7,939</p>
<p>October 1944: (missing)</p>
<p>November 1944: 6,747</p>
<p>The reduction in the number of aircraft produced may be due to the shift in focus to the production of heavy bombers such as the B-29 and B-32, but this is not entirely the case. Please see the production weight, which can also prove this point.</p>
<p>(In 10,000 pounds)</p>
<p>May 1944: 8,980</p>
<p>August 1944: 7,970</p>
<p>September 1944: 7,890</p>
<p>In addition, although the indices of ship production and various ammunition production have soared and increased compared to the production of 1943, the results of guns, tanks, and automobiles in the summer of 1944 were reduced to 80% of those in 1943.</p>
<p>According to the statement of War Mobilization Bureau Chief Payne, the most lacking items in the United States are heavy bombers, heavy weapons and their ammunition, large heavy-duty vehicles, attack transport ships, and landing craft. Among them, the production volume of heavy weapon ammunition necessary for the production of 1944 must be increased to one and a half times that of October in November and December.</p>
<h3>Contrary to Expectations</h3>
<p>The U.S. overseas dispatch force has increased to 60,000 for both the army and the navy, and it is estimated that it will reach 7.5 million by the end of 1944. According to the U.S. Army and Navy authorities, the replenishment required by this group of soldiers is one ton per month for a soldier in Europe and eight tons per month for a soldier in the Pacific. From this, we can know how huge the transportation capacity and materials are needed.</p>
<p>Looking at the current East and West battlefields in the United States, Roosevelt is being forced by the optimistic sentiment of the people he has stirred up—in other words, the war-weariness caused by the relaxation of morale—and is deeply concerned about the division within the Allied camp. Therefore, Roosevelt has to try to end the war as soon as possible, which led to the launch of some reluctant wars since the summer of 1944. However, the result was the opposite. Neither the Pacific War nor the European War allows for optimism, and the difficult facts have clearly explained everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United States in 1944 is different from the end of 1943. Although the war is not known how long it will continue, the people have already jumped out of the war and are dreaming of postwar enjoyment. From this point of view, the U.S. war can no longer rely on the people's morale of hatred for the enemy. However, the only reliable large amount of materials is now in a desperate situation. Seeing that Roosevelt and other war leaders have been clamoring to increase production and expand savings every day recently, this is proof of the shortage of weapons and ammunition production in the United States.

<h3>Encouraging the Spirit of Service: Fundraising for Military and Police Bonuses - Civil Welfare Association and Various Guilds Reach a Successful Resolution</h3>
<p>At the end of last year, the Shanghai Civil Welfare Association, recognizing the urgent need for winter relief, planned to raise 50 million yuan to purchase and distribute relief grain. However, due to time constraints during the fundraising, it was decided to borrow 50 million yuan from the Central Reserve Bank. Simultaneously, the municipal government also established a Winter Relief Committee. The Welfare Association entrusted the winter relief work it had planned to the Municipal Government Winter Relief Committee for unified management and promptly allocated the borrowed 50 million yuan to the Winter Relief Committee. The loan was to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment of 15 million yuan soon due.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the Welfare Association, recognizing the positive impact of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo's efforts to rectify police conduct since taking office, believed that citizens should express their gratitude. Furthermore, to maintain the city's security, the responsibilities of the military and police would inevitably increase in the future. Therefore, coinciding with the end of the lunar year, it planned to raise funds as bonuses for the military and police to encourage them. The association specially convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Kangrong Restaurant, inviting leading figures from various industrial and commercial guilds in the city to discuss fundraising methods.

<h3>Reader's Scholarship News</h3>
<p>Responding Quickly to the March 1st Movement</p>
<p>This time, the Xin Shen Er Bao and the Girls' Christian Association initiated the "Charity Bazaar," with the proceeds used to assist children who have dropped out of school. The "Charity Bazaar" will open at the Eight Immortals Bridge Christian Association on the 3rd and 4th days of the lunar calendar. The students from various schools who are participating are actively promoting it for the preparation of the Charity Bazaar. Everywhere you can see students running around in groups of three or five. They are unusually excited and full of energy, making it hard to believe.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been the launch of the "111" Movement. Not only should the student community be enthusiastic about this initiative, but all compatriots can also enthusiastically help. Therefore, there is the One Person, One Item, One Thousand Yuan Movement. Although it is only one person, one item, and one thousand yuan, if many people participate, small contributions will add up, giving everyone the opportunity to do their part. Furthermore, it can demonstrate the spirit of unity and can complete the grand undertaking of holding this Charity Bazaar. Today, we have already received so many goods donated by enthusiastic comrades in response to the "111" Movement. It is hoped that those who have not participated will also quickly respond. May the "111" Movement be a complete success!</p>
<p>Acting as an Agent for Fundraising, Enthusiastic About Helping Students - Mr. Wang Yang of the Dahua Silk Industry Company wrote: "Respectfully, your newspaper is enthusiastic about helping students and spares no effort, which is admirable. Having been entrusted to participate in donating, I dare not but contribute a little, and I respectfully act as an agent to raise a team's worth, totaling 20,000 yuan, and I personally subscribe for a team's worth, totaling 20,000 yuan, with two checks enclosed. However, these small sums are merely a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem, but they are just a small expression of my sincere intentions."</p>
<p>Various Schools Establish Free Tuition Quotas</p>
<p>(1) The Far East Industrial School offers courses in Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, and General Studies. In response to the Xin Shen Er Bao's call to rescue youths who have dropped out of school, it has specially established 40 free tuition quotas for each department and 30 free tuition quotas for the attached middle school. The school is run by the president of a well-known university's School of Science and Engineering in this city and is based on the principle of strict teaching. The current tuition and fees are set at 6,000 yuan for the attached middle school and 8,000 yuan for the specialized courses. Those wishing to enter the school can register at No. 183 Nanyang Road (near Xiaoshadu Road).</p>
<p>(2) The Private Peiben Middle School is run by alumni of Daxia University and Datong University. Its aim is to rescue those who have dropped out of school, so tuition fees are waived, and only miscellaneous fees of 800 yuan are charged. Those with financial difficulties can still apply for exemption. In response to the Shen Bao's scholarship program, each grade can guarantee the admission of ten students. Registration for new students in all grades of junior high school and elementary school starts immediately. Class time is from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, and from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM on Saturdays and Sundays. The examination date is February 15th. The school is located inside the Shangqing Elementary School at the intersection of Qingdao Road and Xinchang Road. All students from poor families can register for the exam.</p>

<h3>First Batch of Low-Priced Rice Sold: Over 33,000 Yuan per Stone - Business and Industry Purchase 18,000 Stones, Private Schools Purchase 10,000 Stones</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce recently undertook the Municipal Government's distribution of low-priced white rice to the city's business and industrial sectors. This rice will be transported to Shanghai in four phases. In the first phase, the business and industrial sectors will purchase 18,000 stones. The Chamber of Commerce has agreed upon the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) The price for the first phase is 33,750 yuan per stone. (2) Each industry guild can purchase 75 stones of white rice. If it is a factory industry guild, it can purchase 150 stones of white rice, with the principle of transferring it to poor workers in shops and factories. (3) Industry guilds that decide to purchase must collect the rice purchase certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before 12:00 noon on the 8th of this month.

(5) This batch of rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of this month.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will issue a separate notice once the date is confirmed. (6) Rice bags (gunny sacks) must be returned to the original warehouse in their original state within five days after receiving the rice. (7) Due to the urgency of time, the member of each industry guild did not have time to notify their member, member of the industry guilds who have not been notified should directly contact the respective industry guilds for registration. (8) For any unclear matters regarding these measures, you can inquire in person at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Rice Sold to Private Schools</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of low-priced rice to private schools in the city, the Municipal Government has allocated 10,000 stones of rice to be distributed to private educational institutions in the city. The Municipal Consultative Committee has recently notified the various schools. This rice will be delivered in four batches, with the first and second batches accounting for 3,000 stones each, and the third and fourth batches accounting for 2,000 stones each. The price of the first batch of rice is set at 33,750 yuan per stone. The rice is produced in Suzhou. In addition to the allocation to faculty and staff, if there is a surplus, the council will deliberate and decide whether to use it for students' meals. Private schools in the city that have been operating for more than three years and wish to purchase low-priced rice can obtain application forms from St. John's University, Chongde Girls' School, Nanyang Middle School, Jinde Girls' School, and Aiguo Girls' School in this city. The applications must be submitted to the council before 12:00 noon on February 10th. When making the payment, applicants must present the council's notice directly to the Fuxing Bank. Failure to pay by the deadline will be considered as abandonment. As for the rice sacks, they must be returned to the original warehouse in their original state within five days after receiving the rice.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Issue New 100 Yuan Notes Starting Today</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the needs of the market for cash, the Central Reserve Bank previously issued two new types of banknotes, 500 yuan and 10 yuan, starting on the 29th of last month. It is now known that the bank will also issue a new type of 100 yuan note from the 1943 edition starting today (the 8th). The front is decorated with blue patterns, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center. The upper left and right corners are printed with red Western letters, and the lower left and right corners are printed with the seal of the bank's President and Vice President. The back is decorated with green patterns, with a circular image of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in the center. The lower left and right corners are printed with the Western signatures of the bank's President and Vice President. This 100 yuan note is universally accepted with all types of banknotes already issued by the bank.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in the Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is gradually reforming its personnel. Yesterday, it announced that Takahashi Teiichi, the Deputy Director of the West Hongkou Branch Bureau, was to be dismissed for poor service. His vacancy will be filled by Kote Yuukyuro, the Deputy Director of the Zhabei Branch Bureau, and Kikokudaizo, the Deputy Section Chief of the Fourth Division, will be transferred to be the Deputy Director of the Zhabei Branch Bureau.</p>
<h3>Prices Rise Again: Police Bureau Conducts Strict Investigation - All Economic Police Mobilized</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in the city have risen again due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, and unscrupulous merchants have seized the opportunity to act recklessly, disregarding the law, and raising prices without authorization. As a result, the price increase trend has become increasingly fierce, and people's livelihoods are severely threatened. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the economic police authorities in the city. According to the person in charge, "The authorities are determined to thoroughly suppress commodity prices in the city. They have repeatedly warned people in various industries to abide by the law and absolutely not to seek profit at the expense of people's livelihoods. Unscrupulous merchants will be severely punished. As for the recent rise in commodity prices, it is still caused by some unscrupulous merchants arbitrarily manipulating and raising prices without authorization, which is extremely abhorrent. The bureau has mobilized all economic police starting today (the 7th) to actively and secretly conduct a comprehensive investigation, especially on the prices of daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, meat, vegetables, coal briquettes, soap, matches, and sugar. If any unauthorized price increases or acts of hoarding and monopolization are found, they will be severely punished in accordance with wartime laws. Therefore, it is hoped that merchants in various industries will self-discipline and avoid violating the law. Citizens are also encouraged to report unscrupulous merchants to the authorities truthfully so that they can be investigated and dealt with."</p>
<h3>Motor Vehicle Permits: Deadline for Renewal</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has previously stipulated that the 16th term of motor vehicle driving permits in the city should be renewed starting from January 5th. More than one month has passed, and a few vehicle owners have delayed the renewal. It is now known that the bureau has set a deadline for renewal until the 12th of this month.

<h3>New Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association Hosts Farewell and Welcome Tea Party for Two Naval Captains; Event Filled with Warmth</h3>
<p>Captain Shiota of the Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department, having been ordered to a prestigious new post, is soon returning to Japan. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, recognizing Captain Shiota's extensive cooperation and contributions to the Shanghai press community over the past two years, deeply regrets his departure. Therefore, they specially held a tea party yesterday (the 7th) at 4:30 PM at the Cathay Hotel to express their farewell. At the same time, they welcomed the new Captain Matsumoto. Press Chief Matsushima also personally attended, making the tea party exceptionally lively. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Distinguished Gathering</p>
<p>Press Chief Matsushima, accompanied by Captain Shiota and Captain Matsumoto, arrived punctually. Also present were Mr. Lin Junfu, Mr. Sakazume Seiichiro, Mr. Akita, Mr. Wang Bingnan, and Mr. Liu Zhennan, all trusted members of the Fleet Press Department, as well as Mr. Koike, a trusted member of the Japanese Army Press Department, and Chief Liu of the Shanghai Special Municipality Publicity Department (represented by Commissioner Zhu). Mr. Akahoshi and Mr. Sakurai of the Chinese News Association were also in attendance. Chairman Chen Binhe of the Shanghai Branch was unfortunately unable to attend due to an important meeting of the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association, but he sent a representative to read a farewell address. Standing Directors of the Branch, Mr. Osaka Yoichi (representing Mr. Hidaka Kiyomaro), Mr. Xu Liqu, Mr. Jin Xiongbai (representing Mr. Lu Guangjie), Mr. Huang Jingzhai (representing Mr. Zhu Yongkang), Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Yuan Shu (representing Mr. Weng Yongqing), Mr. Moriyama Takashi, Mr. Zhang Zhaoming, and Executive Director Mr. Lu Feng, along with representatives from various newspapers, totaling over two hundred people, were present, creating a distinguished gathering.</p>
<p>Speech by Chen Riping</p>
<p>Standing Director Chen Riping, as chairman, delivered a speech, saying: "Esteemed guests, today the News Association is holding this tea party, on one hand, to bid farewell to Captain Shiota on his prestigious reassignment, and on the other hand, to welcome Captain Matsumoto to his new post. Therefore, this tea party actually carries a double meaning.</p>
<p>Captain Shiota has been in office for two years and eight months. Under the tense circumstances of the Greater East Asia War, he assisted Press Chief Matsushima in shouldering the important responsibility of publicity and reporting, making significant contributions. I would like to express my deep gratitude on behalf of the News Association and the entire Shanghai citizenry for Captain Shiota's hard work and great achievements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because Captain Shiota held the position of publicity and reporting, he maintained close contact with various cultural institutions in the city, especially with our press community, almost on a daily basis. Over the past two years, Captain Shiota's assistance in news reporting and business promotion has been truly significant. This is something that the entire Shanghai press community should gratefully acknowledge in unison. These two points address the public aspect. On a personal level, Captain Shiota has maintained excellent relations and warm feelings with people in the press community through prolonged contact. Therefore, just as we were eagerly anticipating Captain Shiota's continued guidance and assistance, we suddenly heard that he was leaving his post to return home. This is truly a loss for the Shanghai press community. So, from both public and private perspectives, we cannot help but feel regret and disappointment. However, Captain Shiota's prestigious reassignment means that he is leaving Shanghai to take on a more important position. Although we are temporarily separated, from the perspective of the entire East Asia, the mission and responsibilities that Captain Shiota will shoulder in the future, and the results he will achieve, will be equally significant.</p>
<p>We cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy at Captain Shiota's departure from Shanghai, but we hope that Captain Shiota will continue to keep the Shanghai press community in mind, so that even though we are in different locations, we can still maintain a spiritual connection.</p>
<p>Succeeding Captain Shiota is Captain Matsumoto, whom we are also welcoming today. It is said that Captain Matsumoto majored in law and economics at Tokyo Imperial University in his early years, and is both knowledgeable and well-qualified. In the future, he will shoulder the task of publicity and guidance for the Fleet Press Department in Shanghai, and he will certainly make outstanding contributions. This is something we deeply rejoice in. We believe that Captain Matsumoto will use his talents and knowledge to follow in Captain Shiota's footsteps and provide our press community with guidance and assistance in all aspects."</p>
<p>Speech by Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Next, Chairman Chen Binhe of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association delivered a speech (read by a delegated representative): "Captain Shiota, Captain Matsumoto, distinguished guests: Today we are bidding farewell to Captain Shiota and welcoming Captain Matsumoto. We are honored by your presence. I have known Captain Shiota for more than two years. Because Shen Bao is managed by the Navy, I have had many opportunities to interact with Captain Shiota personally due to my official duties. From a public standpoint, I can openly say that this is a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In official matters, Captain Shiota and I mostly shared the same opinions. Even when we had differing views, we were able to discuss them frankly and reach a satisfactory understanding. Therefore, all our work was done voluntarily, without any unexpected interference. That is why I say it is a model of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In the past two years, we have only discussed official matters, not personal matters, but our private friendship is also excellent. I admire Captain Shiota most for two things: first, his seriousness and dedication in handling matters. We often had matters to discuss as early as 8:00 AM, and even at 12:00 AM at night. He had no weekly holidays. This is his hardworking spirit. He is a young man, and generally speaking, young people love beauty. Captain Shiota also loves beauty, but sometimes when he is busy, his beard grows long and he doesn't trim it. His socks are torn at the back, his leather shoes are cracked, but he still wears them. His coat was stolen, and he didn't have money to buy a new one, so he relied on his spirit to keep warm. All of this demonstrates his hardworking spirit, which is worthy of admiration. Once, a Japanese friend working in a Chinese agency asked me what the Chinese side expected of the working spirit of the Japanese in China. I replied that I hoped that Japanese friends, whether working in Chinese or Japanese agencies, could serve as role models. In that case, Mr. Shiota is a representative. Second, he has a deep understanding of Chinese issues and a passion for Chinese youth. Now that Captain Shiota is being transferred away from Shanghai and Captain Matsumoto is taking over, we believe that Captain Matsumoto will certainly be as serious and enthusiastic as Captain Shiota. Finally, on a personal level, I feel very reluctant to part with Captain Shiota, both in terms of public duty and private friendship. I imagine that everyone present feels the same way. I wish Captain Shiota a bright future and good health, and Captain Matsumoto good health as well."</p>
<p>Speech by Matsushima</p>
<p>Subsequently, Press Chief Matsushima delivered a speech, saying briefly: "Today, I am grateful to the Shanghai press community for holding this grand tea party to bid farewell to Captain Shiota and welcome Captain Matsumoto. I am participating in this grand gathering to express my gratitude. In the past two years and eight months, Captain Shiota has given one hundred percent of his ability to the wartime publicity and reporting work. The former News Federation and the current News Association are to us like the sun and moon within the universe. What this means is that I am a weak moon, Captain Shiota is a radiant sun, and the News Association is the great universe. If it can be said that the publicity and reporting work in the past has been successful, then this is due to the radiance of the sun and the inclusiveness of the great universe. Although Captain Shiota is under my command, he is an extremely talented and capable person. I really feel sad to see him transferred this time. Captain Shiota has provided a lot of assistance in the establishment of the Chinese News Association and the Shanghai Branch. Now that the Association is starting to promote its work, Captain Shiota is about to be transferred. I believe everyone also feels reluctant. Fortunately, Captain Matsumoto is succeeding him. He also has a wealth of knowledge and is particularly confident in Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, I hope that everyone will assist Captain Matsumoto with the same enthusiasm as they assisted Captain Shiota. Although the war situation has shifted to Luzon Island and the base war is underway in Manila, we are not pessimistic. On the contrary, it is becoming more and more favorable. Last month, I returned to Japan and saw with my own eyes the completeness of the decisive battle posture. After returning, my conviction became even stronger. In the future decisive battle, gains and losses in local areas are not important. The most important key to victory in the decisive battle lies entirely in the genuine cooperation between China and Japan."</p>
<p>Shiota's Response</p>
<p>Finally, Captain Shiota delivered a thank-you speech, saying briefly: "Today, I am very pleased and grateful to be hosted by the News Association. On the one hand, I feel very depressed because I am leaving Shanghai and parting with everyone. When I came to Shanghai to serve, it was just four months after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, there was little contact between the Shanghai press community and the Navy. Now, we have such contact. I know and have participated in the process in between, so I also feel very pleased. Although I am about to leave Shanghai and my very familiar Chinese friends, I will always have the opportunity to come here again. I hope everyone will continue to work hard and be active. I am grateful for the excessive praise from the Press Chief just now, but I really don't deserve it. Fortunately, Captain Matsumoto has super-excellent abilities. I hope everyone will continue to cooperate with the Press Department, with Press Chief Matsushima as the center, and launch a major offensive against the enemy for the common future of China and Japan."

<h3>Antang Hospital's Finances are Tight; Appeals for Help from All Sectors</h3>
<p>A letter from Antang Charity Hospital states: "Respected Sir/Madam, our hospital was established 57 years ago, with the aim of providing medical relief to the poor and serving the community. In addition to outpatient services, we also have 80 beds. All meals and medicine are provided free of charge. At present, the minimum cost per person per day is 300 yuan, with daily expenses amounting to about 33,000 yuan, and monthly expenses around one million yuan. Before the incident, our hospital's expenses were primarily supported by overseas donations, but now these donations have been completely cut off. However, the hospital's expenses cannot be reduced for even a day. It is difficult to continue without resources. Moreover, most of the patients in our hospital are laborers or rickshaw pullers. These people already struggle to afford meals on a daily basis, and once they fall ill, they are not only unable to support themselves, but their wives and children are also on the verge of starvation and cold. As of today, the plight of our hospital has reached the point of survival or extinction. Therefore, we dare to write this letter to appeal to benevolent gentlemen and ladies to lend a helping hand with compassion, allocating funds for assistance or making monthly donations, so that not only can the lives of the poor and sick in the hospital be extended, but also the decades of facilities in our hospital will not be interrupted. This should be something that charitable people would be happy to support, right? Our hospital is located at 149 at the intersection of Rue Lupan and Route Cardinal Mercier. If you would like to visit and offer advice on improvements, we would be sincerely welcome."</p>
<h3>Second Batch of "Shi Si Long" Tablets for Charity Sale</h3>
<p>A letter from Moore Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory states: "Respected Sir/Madam, our factory sent 500 pieces of 'Shi Si Long' tablets (specially for the treatment of all suppurative diseases) for charity sale last May, and the sale has been completed, with all accounts settled. The results are excellent and commendable. Now, in order to relieve the poor and sick, we are willing to offer another 500 pieces to continue the charity sale. However, due to electricity restrictions, production is inevitably slow, so we are sending 120 pieces first, and will send the rest in succession. However, raw materials have risen again and again, and various expenses have increased sharply. By calculation, even at cost, it would be at least over 1,000 yuan. But in order to give preferential treatment to the charity sale, we are disregarding the cost and pricing each piece at 800 yuan, still following the old practice of recovering half of the cost and donating half to your medical aid fund. This is just a small token of our sincerity."</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Shi of Moore Pharmaceutical Factory donated 40 masks, each priced at 50 yuan. All proceeds from the sale will be used for the local poverty relief fund. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Year-End Savings</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Pan Yusheng states: "Respected Sir/Madam, I am saving on wasteful expenses at the end of the year, and I have saved 5,000 yuan in banknotes. I am donating 1,000 yuan each to your medical aid fund, poverty relief fund, orphaned children's aid fund, Yiyou Society, and Pushan Villa. A small stream of soil cannot supplement great depths, but it is a small token of my sincerity."</p>
