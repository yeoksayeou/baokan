<h3 id="c1">日巧妙誘導戰略呂宋敵陷於困境　馬尼刺巷戰使敵大量出血 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫十日中央社電　敵軍雖已進抵馬尼刺，然呂宋决戰並不因此吿終，反可謂本格之决戰自是開始。敵軍因日軍巧妙之誘導作戰，投入仁牙因之八師團大兵力，無暇構築橋頭堡，使其半數目呂宋平原南下，同時在斯比克灣北方及那斯克布又使三師團上陸，更動員其空挺部隊一旅團急極攻略馬尼刺，依然健在之日軍據點，現仍繼續使敵大量出血。同時自仁牙因灣至馬尼刺二百五十公里細長之呂宋島，敵軍正面側面亦到處遭受日軍威脅。傳在某前線基地之戰鬥指揮部之山下將軍，曾寨然微笑稱，敵軍已人我腹中，全盤大勢已完全操於山下將軍玄妙之戰術推移中。故敵軍之首腦，將因進抵馬尼刺後，更感覺莫大之苦惱。</p>
<p>馬尼刺十日中央社電　馬尼刺市內之戰鬥依然熾烈，刻下之戰鬥中心，在被彈火籠翠之巴希特河一帶。敵軍之一部七日曾以水陸兩用戰車及小舟艇等，由馬拉加尼安大總統官邸附近渡過巴希格河，是時日軍當即加以猛攻。馬尼刺市街戰即在此河南岸及北岸一帶激烈展開，日軍使敵出血甚多。此次戰鬥敵軍曾使用火燄攻射器，襲攻日軍堡壘，同時並於市內各處縱意放火，而使馬尼刺市漸次化爲焦土，敵軍對此行將化焦土之馬尼刺市，七日以來企圖展開正式之攻擊，遂令西方斯比克灣及北方克拉克方面之一二師兵力，向馬尼刺急進，同時衝入馬尼刺之敵騎兵第一師團，等候後援兵團一同猛攻南岸一帶，又克拉克及卡巴那辰方面南下之一部敵兵，企圖切斷馬尼刺東方日軍堡壘，與馬尼刺一部敵軍獲得連擊，而期與南路來攻之部隊取得連絡。敵方現在之陣勢企圖由東西南三方包圍馬尼刺市。敵方復計劃於衝入馬尼刺灣後，即可將馬尼刺市內完全佔領，故連日來特對特烈西德爾島實施猛烈砲擊，同時並使艦船集合於馬尼刺灣口之或迭海上，在此四周重壓中之日軍，始終以寡兵死守該市，且以神妙之戰法使敵大量流血。又馬尼刺東方堡壘及南方之日軍部隊，爲擊碎敵方之包圍陣容，繼續果敢殺敵，故以後之血戰將極趨熾烈矣。</p>
<p>敵美軍編制裝備</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　據發克沃塞司令部一月廿三日發表關於仁牙因灣方面作戰美軍之編制。進攻呂宋之部隊在麥克沃塞將軍指揮下之克爾加麾下之美第六軍，其兵力由五師與一團編成，且敵軍在仁牙因灣之補給，亦頗旺盛。推測敵軍在呂宋之兵力，現已達十師以上，其中裝甲師團約有三師。敵美陸軍之編成，以裝甲師團爲全軍之基幹，步兵師團·汽車化師團·騎兵師團·空輸師團·登陸用海軍師團·均就作戰之要求編制·各部隊之構成，例如步兵師團中，裝甲師團約佔其三分之一，其他爲遊擊軍，亦有適當分配于軍中，其部隊之裝備，完全以物量爲進攻之要素。通常裝甲師團一師，將校約六百名，下士官兵一萬三千名，手槍約一萬枝，自動步槍輕重機槍共合爲二千七百五十挺，迫擊砲八門，戰車砲五十四門。此外七十五生的之自動砲五十餘門，戰車可載七十五生的砲之中型戰車二零八輛，可載三十七生的砲之輕戰車一四六輛，更有裝甲車一五四輛，半裝甲汽車六九零輛，此敵軍裝甲師一師之標準實力。至于步兵一歸將校亦有六百名，下士官兵一萬五千名，步槍一萬六百枝，手槍四千一百校，自動步槍輕重機槍共六七九挺，迫擊砲一〇七門，及戰車砲三十二門，榴彈砲四十八門，其兵員武器彈藥附屬品器材等，由一千八百輛汽車遝輸。然認爲呂宋之敵軍照上述情况編制，則尙屬過早。觀雷伊寨島敵一師兵力，低至一萬二千名左右，戰車一師中有一五〇輛，然敵軍因不論攻擊防禦均恃火力，故一演白刃戰，即感非常恐怖。連日日軍于呂宋展開之挺身突擊隊，實乃攻擊敵軍弱點之必殺戰法也。</p>

<h3 id="c3">敵機盲炸西貢 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>百囊因十日中央社電　加爾各答之敵B29型機十數架，七日炸西貢及浦塞首府百囊因之街市，至八日傍晚，判明死亡者百名，負傷者二百五十名，市中心兩寺院高塔倒塌，寺僧侶數十名負傷，素以佛敎國著稱之百囊因市民，莫不憤慨塡膺。</p>

<p>太平洋前綫基地十日中央社　此次日軍一舉佔領遂川贛州機塲羣，掌握該地戰綫之制空權，於是敵美第十四航空隊之突擊作戰，完全解體。對日本本土之空襲，亦形失敗。最近氣候惡劣，固爲原因之一，然去秋協力重慶軍在衛陽桂柳作戰時之活躍，自衡陽桂柳基地陷落後，彼等對重慶陸軍之協力，更趨困難。重慶軍由於遂川基地羣之失陷，戰意一蹶不振，目下孤立於西南部之重慶軍，大有崩潰之傾向。駐渝美空軍當局正進行內地基地羣之建設，邇來第十四航空隊歛跡之原因，或爲傾注內地之基地建設所致。其建設內地基地之目的有二：（一）空襲佔領區之主要都市，俾資搗亂後方之民心，（二）進行大陸登陸戰之進備。如是觀之，其動向甚値注目。</p>
<h3 id="c5">渝共關係惡化 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>星斯本九日中央社電　延安政權向重慶提出樹立聯合政府之要求，重慶巳予拒絕，故延安有以獨自之立塲建立共產國家之概。據紐約泰晤士報特派員報吿謂「延安政權現巳考處，組織中國民主聯合委員會，或與此類似之獨立機關。此項計劃，若行實現，則中國將分裂爲三，其國內對立之紛爭，殊難以和平之手段解決。目下重慶與延安之交涉，愈感棘手，尙無和解之基礎，兩者完全處於對立之地位」云。</p>

<p>南京十日中央社電　實業部林墾署，爲求各農業改進區經費充裕，人才集中，發揮最大效果起見，特擬具下列改進區調整方案，呈行政院審核備案。該方案內容，將各改進區分別裁撤，僅存江都，嘉興，常熟三縣，聞各區主任人選正銓衡中。</p>

<p>柏林十日中央社電　東綫蘇軍進攻重心，轉向西里西亞之首都布萊斯勞之正面，蘇軍企圖自南面包圍德軍强固之防禦陣地，因德軍英勇抵抗而遭受挫折，此次蘇軍更企圖目北都達成此目的。沃特河下流戰區之形勢，蘇軍目法蘭克福向柏林衝進，傳已開始局部之攻擊，雖或將展開大規模之作戰，然法蘭克福兩側依然繼續熾烈之戰鬥，法蘭克福南方蘇軍，在沃特河西岸確立堅固之地位，同時庫斯特林繼續作拉鋸戰，刻蘇軍已將新銳步兵部隊投入前綫，但庫斯特林之德軍迥廊不能切斷。柏林正面戰綫蘇軍之主力，目下已於沃特河中流八十公里以上之棧漸次增强中，已與德軍展開拉鋸式之攻防戰。蘇軍右冀另一隊自里茲方面經休他喀達向休德琴進攻，最前部隊自休德琴傳已到達二十四公里之處</p>

<h3 id="c12">論上海物價問題 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 吳慕聖</p>
<p>上海雖是華中經濟的重心，上海物價雖亦處處領導影響甚至支配各地的物價，但上海物便的本身則是各種政治軍事與經濟的因素所交互影響而構成的，亦受各地物價的反作用而相對的演變。例如在政治方面，治安的不靖，貪汚的盛行，勒索的繁多，統制施策未臻合理，都可以影響到上海的物價而使其高翔。又如在經濟方面，則運輸的阻滯，生產力的停頓，以及現行的通貨政策，亦足以刺激物價上漲。又上海雖是一個工業中心，但工業生產過程中所需要的各種原料却需求之於各地，如果各地原料的收集遝轍與分配等等無法控制，則上海工業的生產與其所產生的工業製品的價格便也難於控制。凡此種種，即是說明：上海的物價問題乃是一個多方面的綜合的問題，當局者如果要想加以根治，則勢非從政治軍事與經濟各方面同時入手並經由各有關當局通力合作不可，單從上海來着手，或單從經濟方面着眼都有本末不淸之嫌，其收效一定是極微的。</p>
<p>由於物價問題包涵着多面性或綜合性，故欲澈底解决物價問題，自非把國民經濟各部門的活動加以全面的統制不可。例如，我們對於各種物資，如果能够從牠的生產，交換，分配以至消費都能加以全面的控制的話，則配給制度一定能够健全確立，公定價格一定能够支配市塲，黑市一定無法作崇，而投機囤積亦必無所施其技，現在日德等統制經濟高度發展的國家便是這樣，牠們已經做到使物價與貨幣的關係分離。通貨增多不能波及物價，物資缺少也不會促致物價高翔，牠們已經確實做到大家吃苦與公平享受的地步了。但中國——包括上海在內却不是這樣，中國的經濟統制力還不能把國民經濟各部份作一全面與聯繫的統制，因此作爲統制經濟的骨幹的配給制度也就始終無法强固的建立起來，黑市價格到處猖獗，囤積投機的活動極盛，物量與幣量對於物價的關係非但未曾脫離，而且還非常密切。在這種情形之下，當局者主觀的雖亦時以種種方式，例如施行限價，取締囤積或緊縮信用與舉辦部份的物資配給等以求整個物價水準的穩定，然而過去事實昭示，這些企圖大體都沒有成功，其癥結所在，便是因爲牠們還沒有能够把國民經濟作一全面的統制的緣故。</p>
<p>在自由經濟時代物價好像沒有人管束，但實際上牠是以「供求律」作爲調整或控制物價的契機的。在高度統制經濟的國家，物價受全面的配給制度所控制，供求律已不能自由的發生作用。兩者雖然是對立的，但却各有一貫的體系與運行的法則。只有現在的中國，一方面旣已脫離自由經濟的範型，但另一方面則統制經濟的遂行又無法澈底，因此，介在似自由而非自由，似統制而又不全統制的經濟體系下的物價問題，便非常難於解決。</p>
<p>但是，高物價究竟是一個爲害民生而非亟求一解決之道不可的問題，因此，我們試就現實環境所能許可的範疇之內，對常前的高物價問題提出一重點統制的方略。</p>
<p>所謂物價之重點式的統制，便是對有關軍事與民生的物價作一極嚴格的統制，而將其他不重要與實際上無力全部管到的物價予以暫時放棄。關於軍事上的物價重點我們暫緩再談，此處姑先就民生方面來說。就民生方面來看，今日上海所應注視的物價似乎應以下列這幾種爲最重要，即米，柴，煤，蔬菜與藥價是。現在經濟蕭條日甚，大家終日所窮忙的無非是油鹽柴米這一類東西，而這一類東西現在却漲的最貴。又在營養不足的時候，也往往爲疾病所纏擾。因此，如果上述那幾種物價能够眞的設法予以抑平，則上海一般市民的所謂民生問題也就可以說是大半解決了。</p>
<p>旣然說是重點統制，則統制便須澈底，因此，對於如何把上述幾稱物資的價格做得眞正低廉的程度便也値得研究。在這兒，我們願意指出兩點：第一是對於這些物資的收集，運輸與配給，經濟當局應取得充分的支配與管理權，對於這些物資的收運配三權如果無法取得或不能充分發揮，則對於這些物資所訂的公定價格必難長久與大量的維持，黑市便也無從摧毀，而重點式的低物價政策便也失掉了牠的意義了。這是一。其次，要想把這些重要的物資統制得好，則經濟統制的機構便須求其集中，統一簡單。如果政出多門，遇事互相推卸，或互相牽制，則統制的效果必難宏大。至於人事的整肅，根絕舞弊，那是廉潔吏治下所應有的舉措，無待深論。</p>
<p>此外，對於當前上海的物價問題還有一點是必須注意的，那便是對於上海的工業生產必須儘量使其復活，而電力之恢復供給尤爲切要。上海物價之所以高漲，一部份是由於外來物資的昻騰，但上海工業生產力之日趨式微，以致上海對於外埠工業製品的提供一天天的減少，致使外來物資亦更欠圓滑，要亦爲上海物價昇騰的要因之一，故復活上海的生產力，間接對於上海物價的穩定頗有裨益。</p>
<p>總而言之，與其樣樣統制，一事無成，倒不如集中精力把幾種最必需的物資作一重點式的統制，其效果也許比現在還要深遠一點。質諸賢達、以爲然否？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Enemy's Ingenious Enticement Strategy Leads to a Predicament in Luzon: Street Fighting in Manila Causes Heavy Enemy Casualties <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippine Front, 10th: Although enemy forces have advanced to Manila, the decisive battle for Luzon has not yet concluded. On the contrary, it can be said that the real decisive battle is just beginning. Due to the Japanese army's clever enticement strategy, the enemy has committed a large force of the 8th Division to Lingayen, leaving them no time to build a bridgehead. Half of their forces are moving south across the Luzon Plain. At the same time, three divisions were landed north of Subic Bay and Nasugbu, and a brigade of airborne troops was mobilized to swiftly capture Manila. The still-intact Japanese strongholds continue to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Furthermore, along the slender 250-kilometer stretch of Luzon Island from Lingayen Bay to Manila, the enemy forces are constantly threatened by the Japanese army from the front and flanks. It is reported that General Yamashita, at the combat headquarters of a certain forward base, smiled and said that the enemy had entered "my belly," and the overall situation was completely under General Yamashita's mysterious tactical maneuvering. Therefore, the enemy's leadership will feel even greater distress after reaching Manila.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Manila, 10th: The fighting in Manila remains fierce, with the current focus of the battle being in the Pasig River area, which is engulfed in artillery fire. On the 7th, a portion of the enemy forces, using amphibious tanks and small boats, crossed the Pasig River near the Malacañang Palace. The Japanese army immediately launched a fierce attack. The street fighting in Manila has intensified on both the north and south banks of the river, with the Japanese inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In this battle, the enemy used flamethrowers to attack Japanese fortifications and also set fires indiscriminately throughout the city, gradually turning Manila into scorched earth. Since the 7th, the enemy has been attempting to launch a formal attack on Manila, now being reduced to ashes, ordering one or two divisions from Subic Bay in the west and Clark in the north to rush towards Manila. At the same time, the 1st Cavalry Division, which has already entered Manila, is awaiting reinforcements to launch a joint attack on the south bank. A portion of the enemy troops moving south from Clark and Cabanatuan are attempting to cut off the Japanese fortifications east of Manila and link up with enemy forces in Manila, aiming to connect with the forces attacking from the south. The enemy's current strategy is to encircle Manila from the east, west, and south. The enemy also plans to completely occupy Manila once they enter Manila Bay, and has therefore been heavily bombarding Corregidor Island for days, while also gathering ships at Olongapo in Manila Bay. Surrounded by this heavy pressure, the Japanese army continues to defend the city with a small force, using ingenious tactics to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Furthermore, the Japanese forces in the eastern fortifications and south of Manila are continuing to bravely engage the enemy to break through their encirclement, so the future battles will become extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Enemy US Army Organization and Equipment</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: According to a January 23rd announcement by the MacArthur Headquarters regarding the organization of the US forces operating in the Lingayen Bay area, the troops attacking Luzon are under the command of General Krueger of the Sixth US Army, under General MacArthur, consisting of five divisions and one regiment, and the enemy's supply in Lingayen Bay is quite abundant. It is estimated that the enemy's forces in Luzon now number more than ten divisions, including approximately three armored divisions. The organization of the enemy's US Army is based on armored divisions as the core of the entire army, with infantry divisions, motorized divisions, cavalry divisions, airborne divisions, and naval landing divisions all organized according to the requirements of the operation. The composition of each unit, for example, in an infantry division, the armored component accounts for about one-third, and other guerrilla forces are also appropriately allocated to the army. The equipment of their forces is entirely based on quantity as an element of attack. Typically, an armored division has about 600 officers, 13,000 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, about 10,000 pistols, a total of 2,750 automatic rifles, light and heavy machine guns, eight mortars, and 54 tank guns. In addition, there are more than 50 self-propelled 75mm guns, 208 medium tanks with 75mm guns, 146 light tanks with 37mm guns, and 154 armored vehicles and 690 half-track vehicles. This is the standard strength of an enemy armored division. As for an infantry division, there are also 600 officers, 15,000 non-commissioned officers and soldiers, 10,600 rifles, 4,100 pistols, a total of 679 automatic rifles, light and heavy machine guns, 107 mortars, 32 tank guns, and 48 howitzers. Personnel, weapons, ammunition, accessories, and equipment are transported by 1,800 vehicles. However, it is too early to assume that the enemy forces in Luzon are organized according to the above-mentioned situation. Observing the enemy's one division force on Leyte Island, it is as low as about 12,000 men, and there are 150 tanks in an armored division. However, because the enemy relies on firepower for both attack and defense, they feel very fearful in a bayonet fight. The suicide attack squads launched by the Japanese army in Luzon in recent days are indeed a sure-kill tactic to attack the enemy's weaknesses.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 10th that approximately 90 enemy aircraft attacked northern Kanto on the afternoon of the 10th. The results of the interception are currently under investigation, and some damage has been done to Japanese ground facilities.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Pailin, 10th: A dozen enemy B-29 aircraft from Calcutta bombed Saigon and the city of Pailin, the capital of Pursat, on the 7th. By the evening of the 8th, it was clear that 100 people had died and 250 were injured. The pagodas of two temples in the city center collapsed, and dozens of monks were injured. The citizens of Pailin, known as a Buddhist country, were filled with indignation.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Pacific Front Base, 10th: With the Japanese army's recent capture of the Suichuan and Ganzhou airfield groups, gaining control of the airspace over that battle line, the enemy's US Fourteenth Air Force's assault operations have completely disintegrated. Air raids on the Japanese mainland have also been unsuccessful. The recent bad weather is one reason, but their activity in supporting the Chongqing army during the operations in Weiyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou last autumn has become more difficult since the fall of the Hengyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou bases. The Chongqing army's morale has plummeted due to the loss of the Suichuan base group, and the Chongqing army, now isolated in the southwest, is showing signs of collapse. The US Air Force authorities stationed in Chongqing are conducting the construction of inland base groups. The recent decrease in activity by the Fourteenth Air Force may be due to the focus on the construction of inland bases. There are two purposes for building inland bases: (1) to bomb major cities in the occupied areas to disrupt the morale of the rear, and (2) to prepare for a mainland landing operation. Viewed in this light, their movements are worthy of close attention.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Springsbok, 9th: The Yan'an regime has made a request to Chongqing to establish a coalition government, which Chongqing has rejected. Therefore, Yan'an is likely to establish a communist country independently. According to a report by a New York Times correspondent, "The Yan'an regime is now considering organizing a Chinese Democratic United Committee or a similar independent organization. If this plan is realized, China will be divided into three, and the internal conflicts will be difficult to resolve through peaceful means. Currently, the negotiations between Chongqing and Yan'an are becoming increasingly difficult, with no basis for reconciliation, and the two are completely opposed to each other."</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: In order to ensure sufficient funding, concentrate talent, and maximize the effectiveness of various agricultural improvement areas, the Forestry and Reclamation Department of the Ministry of Industry has drafted the following adjustment plan for the improvement areas and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The plan involves abolishing various improvement areas, leaving only Jiangdu, Jiaxing, and Changshu counties.

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: The focus of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front has shifted to the front of Breslau, the capital of Silesia. The Soviet army is attempting to encircle the German army's strong defensive positions from the south, but has been thwarted by fierce German resistance. Now, the Soviet army is attempting to achieve this goal by heading north. In the situation in the lower Warta River war zone, the Soviet army is advancing towards Berlin from Frankfurt, and it is reported that localized attacks have begun. Although a large-scale operation may be launched, fierce fighting continues on both sides of Frankfurt. South of Frankfurt, the Soviet army has established a solid position on the west bank of the Warta River. At the same time, the battle of Kustrin continues, and although the Soviet army has deployed new infantry units to the front line, the German corridor in Kustrin cannot be cut off. The main force of the Soviet army on the Berlin front is now gradually increasing its strength in the stretch of more than 80 kilometers along the middle reaches of the Warta River, and has engaged in a tug-of-war offensive and defensive battle with the German army. Another Soviet unit on the right flank is attacking from the direction of Landsberg through Küstrin-Kietz towards Seelow. The vanguard unit is reported to have reached a point 24 kilometers from Seelow.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Berlin Citizens Determined to Resist <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: According to a Berlin dispatch in the Mainichi Shimbun, the inhumane large-scale bombings by the British and American air forces have further strengthened the Berlin citizens' determination to resist. After the air raids, the high-rise buildings and residences in the city center have been completely destroyed, power lines are hanging down, and gas and telephone lines are completely cut off. The devastation of the air raids is truly indescribable. Refugees are lined up in front of drinking water and food distribution points waiting for supplies. The reconstruction units of the engineering corps continue to be active. The four million citizens continue to work hard on defense facilities. Key points in the city have been prepared, and trenches are lined up everywhere, suggesting that fierce street fighting is inevitable. There are many military trains in the city, the police force is fully armed, and people's assault teams are patrolling with guns.

<h3 id="e11">New Offensives Launched on the Northern and Southern Wings of the Western Front: German Forces Retreat to the East Bank of the Rhine <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Reuter's report: The offensive by the right wing of the Canadian army at the Nijmegen bridgehead, following heavy artillery fire and aircraft bombing, can be seen as the preliminary action of a major anti-Axis offensive. This offensive seems to be creating a focal point for the offensive. The large army concentrated northeast of Aachen indicates that the focus of the offensive is between the Meuse River and the Eifel region, and the British Second Army and the US Ninth Army may launch an attack at any time. The anti-Axis forces' pincer attack on the Rhineland-Westphalia industrial area seems to be beginning, with the British and American forces on the southern wing and the Canadian forces on the northern wing. The Canadian forces encountered extremely strong resistance at Gennep, and only gained a foothold in a few small towns. The US Third Army is now the main force in the Eifel region, indicating that a large part of the US First Army has moved north, intending to break through the northern German plain.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: DNB report: Yesterday, strong French infantry units and tank columns attacked continuously day and night in the upper Rhine River, attempting to disrupt the German army's withdrawal movement in that area. The German rearguard fought fiercely with the enemy, allowing most of the German army and heavy weaponry to cross the Rhine River to the east bank via the Ruhmberg bridge. After the last batches of German troops had withdrawn, the bridges were blown up, and German artillery fire forced the pursuing French forces on the west bank to take cover.</p>

<h3 id="e12">On the Shanghai Price Problem <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Musheng</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is the economic center of Central China, and Shanghai's prices lead, influence, and even dominate prices in various places, Shanghai's prices themselves are the result of the interaction of various political, military, and economic factors, and are also subject to the reaction of prices in various places and relative changes. For example, in the political sphere, insecurity, rampant corruption, numerous extortions, and unreasonable control measures can all affect Shanghai's prices and cause them to soar. In the economic sphere, transportation blockages, stagnation of productivity, and the current currency policy are also sufficient to stimulate price increases. Although Shanghai is an industrial center, the various raw materials required in the industrial production process are demanded from various places. If the collection, transportation, and distribution of raw materials cannot be controlled, then the production of Shanghai's industry and the prices of its industrial products will be difficult to control. All of this illustrates that Shanghai's price problem is a multifaceted and comprehensive issue. If the authorities want to fundamentally solve it, they must simultaneously address it from political, military, and economic perspectives, and through the concerted efforts of all relevant authorities. Tackling it solely from Shanghai or focusing solely on the economic aspect is like ignoring the root and pursuing the branches, and the results will certainly be minimal.</p>
<p>Because the price problem encompasses multiple aspects or is comprehensive, a thorough solution to the price problem requires a comprehensive control of the activities of all sectors of the national economy. For example, if we can comprehensively control various materials from production, exchange, distribution, and even consumption, then the rationing system will certainly be soundly established, official prices will certainly dominate the market, black markets will certainly be unable to thrive, and speculation and hoarding will have no room to operate. The highly developed countries with controlled economies, such as Japan and Germany, are like this. They have already separated the relationship between prices and currency. An increase in currency cannot affect prices, and a shortage of materials will not lead to soaring prices. They have indeed achieved a state where everyone suffers and enjoys fairly. But China—including Shanghai—is not like this. China's economic control power cannot comprehensively and connect all parts of the national economy, so the rationing system, which is the backbone of the controlled economy, has never been strongly established, black market prices are rampant everywhere, speculative and hoarding activities are extremely prevalent, and the relationship between the quantity of goods and the quantity of currency to prices has not only not been decoupled, but is also very close. Under these circumstances, although the authorities subjectively try to stabilize the overall price level in various ways, such as implementing price limits, cracking down on hoarding, tightening credit, and organizing partial material rationing, past facts have shown that these attempts have generally not been successful. The crux of the problem is that they have not been able to comprehensively control the national economy.</p>
<p>In the era of a free economy, prices seem to be uncontrolled, but in reality, they use the "law of supply and demand" as a mechanism for adjusting or controlling prices. In countries with highly controlled economies, prices are controlled by a comprehensive rationing system, and the law of supply and demand cannot operate freely. Although the two are opposing, they each have a consistent system and operating rules. Only in present-day China, on the one hand, it has already deviated from the paradigm of a free economy, but on the other hand, the implementation of a controlled economy cannot be thorough. Therefore, the price problem under an economic system that is seemingly free but not free, and seemingly controlled but not fully controlled, is very difficult to solve.</p>
<p>However, high prices are ultimately a problem that harms people's livelihood and requires an urgent solution. Therefore, we will try to propose a strategy of focused control for the current high price problem within the scope that the current environment can permit.</p>
<p>The so-called focused control of prices means imposing extremely strict control on prices related to military and people's livelihoods, while temporarily abandoning other unimportant prices and prices that are practically impossible to fully manage. We will postpone discussing the military-related price focus for now, and first discuss the people's livelihood aspect. From the perspective of people's livelihood, the prices that Shanghai should pay attention to today seem to be the following as the most important, namely rice, firewood, coal, vegetables, and medicine prices. Now that economic depression is increasing, everyone is busy all day long for nothing more than things like oil, salt, firewood, and rice, and these things are now the most expensive. Also, when nutrition is insufficient, people are often plagued by diseases. Therefore, if the above-mentioned prices can really be suppressed, then the so-called people's livelihood problem of the average citizen of Shanghai can be said to be mostly solved.</p>
<p>Since it is said to be focused control, the control must be thorough. Therefore, it is also worth studying how to make the prices of the above-mentioned materials truly low. Here, we would like to point out two points: First, the economic authorities should obtain full control and management rights over the collection, transportation, and rationing of these materials. If the three rights of collection, transportation, and allocation of these materials cannot be obtained or cannot be fully exercised, then the official prices set for these materials will be difficult to maintain for a long time and in large quantities, the black market will be impossible to destroy, and the focused low-price policy will lose its meaning. That is one. Secondly, to control these important materials well, the economic control mechanism must seek to be centralized, unified, and simple. If policies come from multiple sources, and they shirk responsibility or restrain each other, then the effectiveness of the control will be difficult to achieve. As for the rectification of personnel and the eradication of corruption, these are measures that should be taken under honest governance and do not need to be discussed in depth.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one point that must be noted regarding the current price problem in Shanghai, that is, industrial production in Shanghai must be revived as much as possible, and the restoration of electricity supply is especially important. Part of the reason for the high prices in Shanghai is due to the rise in the cost of imported materials, but the fact that Shanghai's industrial productivity is declining day by day, resulting in a daily reduction in the supply of industrial products to Shanghai from other ports, which makes the import of materials even less smooth, is also one of the reasons for the rise in prices in Shanghai. Therefore, reviving Shanghai's productivity indirectly contributes to the stability of Shanghai's prices.</p>
<p>In short, rather than controlling everything and achieving nothing, it is better to concentrate efforts on a focused control of a few of the most necessary materials, the effect of which may be more far-reaching than it is now. I ask the wise men, is this so?</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Dr. Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, published a statement in the February 8th issue of the national weekly, titled "The Nation Rising to Defend," expressing his determination as follows: The enemy is now taking back the most economically important areas of German territory. The era when we had surplus land to carry out operations is over. Now, the loss of one acre of land, one city, or one factory will cause a major loss to many Germans. Soviet soldiers are committing atrocities everywhere, and their extreme cruelty is beyond words. To overcome this danger, there is no other way. The German leadership can only hope that the German people will endure great pain and misery. In the two thousand years of German history, Germany has suffered many hardships, but Germany has always been victorious and maintained its dominant position in continental Europe. At present, the German people are fighting hard on the defensive, often suffering hardship, but are convinced that only the German people can overcome this danger. The danger to the world lies in the military countermeasures that are now gradually being put in place. Once the danger reaches its peak and affects all nations, it will be the time for the large number of barbarians in the northern steppes to suffer a terrible reckoning. Until then, keeping a cool head is the most important thing. Fellow countrymen, seeing this miserable reality, should rise up together. The Germans will never bow down and surrender before the war.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning (the 10th), Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government met separately with reporters from Japanese and Western newspapers in the city, elaborating in detail on the issue of commodity prices. He stated: "The issue of commodity prices is a significant fundamental problem at present. The Municipal Government is willing to enforce all economic laws and regulations related to commodity prices and is determined to first eliminate all artificial causes of the commodity price problem. Economic criminals have been reported to the central government and will be dealt with entirely by military law. Regarding institutions, the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee has recently been reorganized, and several specialized committee members have been added. These so-called 'specialized committee members' are those with extensive research on the city's commercial situation, market conditions, cost calculations, and the types and sources of materials. Speaking of commodity prices, we cannot ignore the fact that the management and crackdown on commodity prices are merely a passive method. The most important thing is to maintain a sufficient supply of materials. This will greatly facilitate the resolution of commodity price issues."</p>
<p>Economic Bureau to Hold Temporary Emergency Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau has drafted concrete implementation plans for suppressing commodity prices, managing materials, and strengthening the organizational structures of industrial and commercial associations, which will be implemented step by step.

<p>In order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Economic Bureau strictly enforces price controls on the sale of goods by various businesses. It has been found that Ziyangguan at 173 Jinling Road and Xiangfengtai at 244 Datong Road in this city sell red and white *zao* fermented bean curd for as much as 70 yuan per piece, which is 45 yuan more than the controlled price of 25 yuan per piece. This situation hinders the government's laws and regulations to suppress prices in the city and is indeed hateful. It is hereby ordered that they be punished with a ten-day suspension of business from the 10th to the 19th of this month to maintain the price control laws and serve as a warning to others.</p>
