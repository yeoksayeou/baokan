<h3 id="c16">改善獄政 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>司法行政部長吳頌皋及李思浩氏等，一昨爲改善監獄衛生舉行茶會，束請各界領袖捐輸基金，使一般罪犯減少疾病痛苦，這是人道上應有之舉，社會人士，都應奮起資助。</p>
<p>監獄之設，原是不得巳而採取的政治工具，原意只在約束人間少數不肖及罪犯，使不致爲害羣之爲，和傳染病人之必入隔離醫院，具有同一意義，所以聖賢從政求治的最高理想，是「訟簡刑輕」四個字，當戰爭時期，或在經濟恐慌之際，始有「囚溢於牢」的必然現象。但是無論如何，罪犯除了法律所規定應受的懲罰之外，不應再受法外的痛苦。</p>
<p>不過，理論上雖然如此，實際上，司法經費拮据，監獄房舍，大多因陋就簡，不合囚犯衛生原則。千百年來死於法律以外之懲罰者正不知凡幾！</p>
<p>近年以來，司法權漸臻獨立；另一方面由於司法當局整飭圖治，若前任司法行政部長羅君强氏，及已故之張雲搏氏，尤其是張雲搏氏，爲着改善囚犯的生活，竟以身殉。今日吳頌皋部長更以專家而主政，力謀改善獄政，並從改良醫藥衛生着手，實事求是，漸收成效。不過在此政府經濟困窘之時，改善獄政之完成，端賴社會各界俊彥之捐輸與　助。</p>
<p>我們認爲一方面固然必須致力於監獄囚犯物質生活之改善，醫藥衛生設施之補充及改良，以免囚犯遭受法律以外的痛苦。另一方面，千萬罪犯，坐糜國帑，無所事事，亦不合理。我們建議利用壯年囚犯，對國家建設及其他可能從事的事業，使之服務。監獄中雖有使監犯工作者，但或管理不善，或賞罰不明，或所選工作不適於各別之人犯，以致事倍功半。今後當有完整之計劃，適時適地以經營之，凡工作誌眞及成績優越的，應加特別獎勵，如免刑減刑及其他權利等。</p>
<p>在監犯中，我們特別重視對於政治犯的待遇問題題，政治犯不論其思想如何荒謬，其行動如何違法，但其犯罪動機，或非爲一身一家的私利，所以，不無可以原諒之處，且世界各團對於政治犯，大體上都須予以特別優待，使享受與普通囚犯不同的待遇，予以微發悔過自新之機會；尤其是大多數和平區的政治犯，更具有比平當政治犯可以赦宥的地方，我們更應盡力加以敎導，使其自覺自新，我們感覺靑年有爲人才不易培養，希望中日雙方有關當局對此特別留意。</p>
<p>在討論改善獄政之餘，我們尤覺對於寃獄平反及出獄人之保障，更望有關富局及熱心人士出面指導，社會秩序與人　保障，實深利賴。</p>

<p>長陽路一四七號上海監獄，俗稱提籃橋西牢，在上海的三處監獄中—包括舊特二區馬斯南路監獄，與漕河涇監獄—規模最大，設備也最講究。五年之前，收容罪犯的最高紀錄，曾達八千五百餘名。最近緊犯之數雖已減少至二千名左右，可是提起「外國牢監」這幾個字，至少在社會某一階層中，還保持一種不可名狀而帶有恐佈及神秘的色彩罷。</p>
<p>尚書上說：「明於五刑，以弼五敎」；老子也說「民不畏死，奈何以死畏之」。本來監獄的最大作用，除了治罪之外，無非要把一個犯人從罪惡中解脫出來，利用感化方法，使之悔過自新，恢復做一個有益於社會國家的人。因之監獄的設備，以及官理罪犯的精神，都應該採取積極手段。酷刑虐待，非人道果不必說，在「民不畏死」之下，於事又何補呢？</p>
<p>公寓式的建築物</p>
<p>在沈典獄長和李候補　守所長接待導引之下，記者昨天在有限的時間中，餐館了這大規模的罪人之　。上海監獄的建筑，是把幾座五　鋼骨水泥的大廈，　集中在廣約十餘畝空塲上。因為屋　高　，建筑宏偉，遠望倒有些像「公寓」之團，其位置，進門一所房子為典獄官公事房，感化院·病院和忠·孝兩監，分列左右。再進中央為工塲，左為信·義·和·平塲和仁·愛兩監之間為炊塲。</p>
<p>這五幢大洋房裏，除了辦公的官吏捕役之外，最近約收容男女艦犯二千餘名，而實際上其中約有三分之一，已移往他處做工，所以五年之前「人滿之患」的威脅，倒不感覺了。據沈典獄長稱，他對於囚糧支配，工作的管理，和衛生等各問題，都很注意，當然須要補充和改善之處還多，事實上部要看經濟和人力兩項，是否可能來解決其困難。尤其是經濟上的困難，目前是最難解決的。</p>
<p>囚犯們的飲食</p>
<p>使最沒有規律的人們，變成最機械式的動作，這是監獄生活的第一章。目下他們七時前起身，八時半晨餐，即開始工作。下午二時半至三時間吃飯。四時許停工，如做夜工，再得進餐一次，時間約在七八時。因爲參觀的時間剛剛是囚犯們「吃的享受」之時，只見他們很有規律底，把一罐罐飯和菜的食品，安置在食食中送給他們伙伴吃。飯倒是白飯，上面舖上蠶豆和蔬菜。不受處份而工作的犯人都吃到近乎滿滿一罐的午飯。病犯和女犯們還有　飯和豆腐漿吃。這些東西，究竟足　維持一個人必需的營養麼？常然不敢武斷，可是在犯人本身來說，或者未必不是一件可以感謝的事。况且，據說監獄當局爲了維持一個月吃四次　菜，即兩次魚，兩次肉，曾經煞藝周章呢。</p>
<p>集團生活</p>
<p>女監裏有二百多名女犯，她們以運私，竊盜，拐騙等的罪案爲多，在沒有吃飯之前都忙着做工，織手套，　　，製鞋等等都有，她們的工資相當輕微，但是實際上，有工作做的女犯，比了枯坐在牢房屋隅，滿面現着憂愁悲京的的同伴們要幸福多了。至少她們獲得羣居和共同工作，集團生活的人的樂趣。</p>
<p>不論男女犯，所住的牢房，方廣，僅足「容身」，可是收拾得相當淸楚。女犯們有床舖，因爲她們體弱。地上隨時有犯人　掃。其實因爲東西太簡單，換句話說，身外之物已減至無可再減。舖板之上只有毯和褥，室隅一圖桶，泥壁鐵窗，如是而已。就衛生方面說，東西愈簡單愈容易收拾淸楚，就人生哲學上說，身外之物愈少，種種煩惱也愈少。囚犯們的這種環境，眞是最好不過的悔過和自省之樂國呢。</p>
<p>洗換衣服被褥每週一次，都用很講究的洗衣機，替代人工，淸潔迅速兼而有之。破爛衣服也有專門的囚犯們加以整理。綸及工作，我們不妨比較詳細的說一說。</p>
<p>設備完善的工塲</p>
<p>犯人們做工，是監獄中管理方面最重要的一件事。第一可以利用生產，第二可以使囚犯們刑滿釋後，得賴以生存，第三可以減少罪犯們寂寞懶惰和依賴性，一而又可以養成其自尊心。上海監獄中的工塲設備相當完善。在工作方面計有：印刷·裝釘·本漆·鐵工·縫衣·製鞋·編織草毯等等。他們接受外界定貨，和替公家承做一切工作。譬如和我們日常接觸，至少和每一個市民發生關係的，像戶口調查表，各種公共機關捐　收據等，很多的由這個上海監獄中犯人所印製。</p>
<p>鐵工塲裏正在修理大批的飯桶和食盒，這些東西都是用鉛皮金屬料所製，一過破爛，便須修焊。因爲犯人有一千數百名，單是食盒一項已經數不在少了。除了印刷工塲規模比較最大之外，其他工塲視各方需要和工作　簡，而定做工囚犯的多冪。最近實際有工作做的囚犯大約有九百至千人左右。大家有工作，大家有飯吃，如更能改善豈非更合乎理想？</p>
<p>走進印刷工塲，一股油墨鉛字和夾着「鐵腥氣」的味道直衝鼻觀，大小脚踏架，打樣架，切紙　等轆轆的機車聲，接連打入耳朶，吃過「油墨」飯的人，似乎故友重逢，未色要格外注意。工塲分兩部，一部排字房，一部印刷房。前者的設備好像一家中型的印刷店，後者倒不愧稱為一家比較規模大的印刷廠。單看牆上掛着一塊黑板，上面為着「印刷工塲工作限七表」字樣。大小印刷機車計共十七座，有脚踏架，有「大英」機，有切紙樣等。正在印刷中的品名，譬如戶口調查表，火災報告節略，拍紙薄，合作社經濟商配貨單，信紙借對收條名片等。除了請柬婚喪帖子外，大概公家　關的東西應有盡有了。釘書也是一部專門工作，另有若干囚犯負責其事。</p>
<p>管理工塲不是件容易的事，每一部份派有工頭，除若干技術工人中非罪犯担任外，其餘都由犯人中量才授以各種手藝技術。最感興趣的，在縫衣工塲中，看見兩個囚犯正在做着兩件很時式的女人旗袍，低領短袖，窄腰輕裾，而且花式又很新穎，其中一件還是綢子的呢，當然這也外面人委託做的，而這個犯人以前也是拿過剪</p>
<p>入獄三部曲——剃頭，入浴，換衣</p>
<p>在感化院中看見有幾個犯人，正在看書——新舊約和各種善書之類，另有若干靑年犯上過課正在自修。更有「一個新」犯人正在剃頭——這是人獄三步曲中的第一步，就是剃頭，人浴，換衣編號——考究得很，他們用電氣「剃刀」哩，一個靑年犯用手搖發電機　電，一個「老」犯把變飽很自由很隨便的在那犯人頭上推來拖去。原來犯人只能剃平而髮短的頭，不准有高低起伏的形式，更不能施膏抹脂，故而我們認爲繁複的剪髮技巧，在這裏倒是若無其事了。</p>
<p>這個新犯人經過剪髮之後，就到一個很廣大浴室中去洗澡，一面，把他從外面另一個世界上帶來的衣服，不論中西長短，新舊毛棉，都剝脫　淨，換上編有號碼的囚衣。目下他們大半穿牙着白布衫褲外面單上灰褐色的背心或短襖。在牢獄中，到處只見這兩種顏色，白和灰褐，囚犯們的衣服不用說，墻壁上面白下層灰褐，褥和被也是這種色彩，馬口錢的食盒，甚至水門汀地板，和犯人的險色，都帶着這種憂　沉悶的色彩，這大概就是監獄之所以為監獄能。</p>
<p>最後，我們又到病院和辦公處參觀。一個是　人最痛苦，同時又是最幸福的地方。一個是怎樣能使龐大如上海監獄者得以管理得如此有條理有辦法的首腦樞紐。</p>
<p>為犯人們　幸福，為國家為社會多保留有用的人，改良監獄設備是値得注意的，但是由於經濟方面的困難，有許多良好的計劃未能推行，特別是衛生工作等，但又在在需款，無法着手，常此夏令疫　業生之際，實在不容漠視，深望社會人士能為今後的治安與人道打算，予以有力的援助。</p>

<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據舊金山電；世界和平保障組織會議，昨日投票決定世界安全大會之組織，應於五大常務理事國外，復包括六非常務理專國，然該六國之選擇，應視彼等對維持國際安全貢獻之大小以及有相當土地領域爲斷定。按該項票決係依照美蘇渝等各國所提出之修正建議。又週三席會上該組織會議又投票決定，法國於建國完成後，亦將爲大會中之常務理事國。</p>
<h3 id="c26">委治地問題　兩陣地營對立 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊據舊金山訊，紐西蘭總理兼舊金山會議國際委治委員會議長佛拉薩，於日前接見新聞界發表聲明，對於國際委治問題闡述頗詳。內容略謂，各國對此問題，意見甚爲縣殊，截至現在爲止，澳洲·菲島·法國荷　·中國·南非·美國·英聯合一國及蘇聯，均已將自國之竟見，向委員會陳述。該會業已開會三次，一般討論即可終了。但主要問題如　國際委治制之領土，是否應分為戰略的，非戰略的及福利的三種區域，　安全區域應否置於安全理事會之下，　戰略區域應否置於安全理事會之下，福利區域應否置於安全委員之下等問題，仍未見解決。佛拉　又　述該委會之工作稱，委員會工作因　巴頓會議建議中，殊少關於國際委治制之規定條項，大受阻碼，目下僅根據雅爾達協定，將國際委治地領土，分爲舊國聯委治地·此次戰爭中奪自敵人之領土·及希望編入國際委治制之殖民地三者而已。委員會除依據雅爾達協定外，殆無所適從，僅收到有關國家許多建議而已。</p>
<p>小組會草方案該會業已成立小組會，以美國代表團代表斯太休上校爲主任委員·現正根據各國建議起草方案。佛拉薩又稱，各國僅希望採用關際統治機構之建議，未及於特殊領土問題之討論，致使委員會工作大感困難。又稱，該會又一難點，當爲目前美蘇渝三者沆瀣一氣，與英法荷比等殖民地國家陣營對立。據過去開會經過言，各國衝突計有三點：　關於國際統治之目標，美蘇渝反對統治地人民之獨立，以爲如此足以使自身經濟上陷於不利之地位，晶形成無衣上之帳壁，給予本國工業及工人以極大不利。　關於統治地之經濟問題，美國主張應保護殖民國家自身之工業，　國際統治委員會主張調查統治區域之實况，但殖民地國家均表反對。</p>
<p>美提出妥協案　葡京十八日中央社電　據舊金山電：中南美代表主張之地域協定問題，已成爲舊金山會議前途之障得，復因蘇聯反對，致會議陷於停頓狀態。臨時主席斯蒂丁紐斯爲打開此種僵局，特於十五日夜召開五國會議，但蘇代表以未奉莫斯科曾令爲理由，拒絕出席，故事實上實爲四國會議。該會中美國提出妥協性之新美洲互相防衛條約，據傳巳獲得英法渝三國承認，斯蒂丁紐斯更爲決定該妥協案是須經全體會討論，定十七日召集五國會議，如果是時蘇聯訓令仍未到達，則可見蘇聯反對美國妥協案之意思。</p>

<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>此次滬西大火，棚戶方面捐失情形，已於前日本報上略作報告，衖堂裹面居民的損失也很重大。這種衡堂房十，包括均安坊和隆興坊，共有二百九十戶。其中至少有二百家是貧戶，總共是一千九百人，他們多數都在附近的工廠裏做工，一部份約四十多家是做豆芽生意，其他則是失業工人，現在擺擺攤頭，販販米過活，他們的籍貫可分爲寗紹幫，蘇北幫，本地幫，顯然較欄戶來得複雜，他們的衣物自然比棚戶多些，所受損失自然也較大。</p>
<p>且說隆興坊，這衖堂有四十二個門牌，房十的建築相築牢固，不過房東爲了使得每被房十多住幾家，於是在每一層樓里用木板又搭起擱樓，一間客堂也用木板分成三四間，在晒台上又用三夾板，洋松板等搭起四曆樓來，本來好好的磚瓦房，也一變而是木質居多了。</p>
<p>這衖堂用的長自流井，以電力汲永，建在該弄二十一號內，去年一月第一次限電起，居民日停止供給，然而實際上水並不眞的斷絕，實爲房東以黑市供給了老虎灶和作發豆芽生意的住戶。據說寶與老虎灶的黑市自來永（有專管可通），每月收十五萬元，賣與發豆芽的黑市自來永每月由五千元至一萬元不等，總計據說有五十萬元，此次火警發生後，該項自流井因爲鎖於屋內無法使用，以致救火車到時竟無法取得水源。</p>
<p>又有人說，該衛的某某兩號內囤積着大量火油，肥皂，木芯（一種作綫軸的原料），顏料和焦煤（可罰三千度熱、是專供翻砂廠熔發爐用的煤。）這些東西都是最易燃而耐燒的，火力之強，知道記者第四日下午去巡視時，還看見從瓦轉堆的磚縫裏，買出煙來，顯然仍在裏面燃燒。</p>
<p>居民的擁擠·永遠之缺乏·危險物品之囤積，正爲使此次餘姚路火災蔓延得如此廣大的主要原因。上海每個角落中不乏隆興坊一類的衖堂，在敵興濫炸的今日，一旦有事，危險之大不難想像。所以本市市民自動疏散，正是刻不容緩的事。每個人應當記住這次大災給我們的淒慘敎訓。</p>
<p>一堵堵的　恒殘壁，毀的傢俱儀件，大堆燒焦了的轉塊和永門汀。……最引人注目的是幾十隻壞破了的大缸，這是發豆芽用的生財。一些燒剩的杜披間，損壞得較小，他們就清除碎磚瓦·用稻草權且舖一個鋪位。他們無家可歸，只有守着這曆　，他們希望在廢墟上再建設起新的家。</p>
<p>劫後生活非藏淒慘，拿工人說吧，他們大都是前面三賓，萬暫，九昌等廠的工人，廠已燒掉，工從何做起，有的廠家雖發三四萬元救濟費，但坐吃山空何濟於事，於是不得不東奔西跑的找親戚朋友，張羅著欵子或者另外謀新的出路，他們幾乎完全變成了失業者。</p>
<p>這些衛中的災戶，現在也是靠着施放的粥飯來維持生命，他們比作苦力的棚戶更難生活，因爲於他們不會赤手空拳的出賣勞力。</p>
<p>餘姚路火災，自本報代收捐款以來，即承各界人士以無比的熱誠紛起響應。在三天之內，所收捐款已達一千餘萬元，這數月足以說明本市居民互助精神的偉大。</p>

<h3 id="c54">申報周刋出發前之特攻隊 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>最後一餐</p>
<p>若包的海苔飯糰三個，外加鹹羅葡三根，這就是振武特攻隊最後的「辨當」。飯糧是珍珠似的白米飯製成的，劈開來，中央的　子是眞好的梅乾，紅紅的，館　可愛。勇士們在機上吃究了這最後的一餐販，便要出發共敵。米飯，海苔，梅乾和鹹羅葡，雖不是什麽珍藏，却深深表出了祖國的心，用這種飯糰作爲負起祖國命運而突入冲繩之海的特攻隊員最後的辦當，實在再恰當也沒有了。</p>
<p>特攻隊員穿着全副飛行服，膝蓋以上部分，隆起如燈籠，狼吞虎嚥地吃着飯糧。這種光景，眞叫記者不勝感動。自從第二次特別攻擊開始總攻以來，已經三天了，今日也有大批振武特攻隊從這基地出發。</p>
<p>以精神的力量粉碎敵方的物質量，乃是日本獨擅的戰法。這回的總攻擊，所得的效果將顯現於戰局的表面。特攻精神是流貫日本三千年歷史而深値於民族心坎的。當此祖國危急之秋，以個人的生命來挽救祖國光榮的歷史，一點沒有不合理的地方。唯此才能表現日木獨一無二的特攻精神。因爲這是祖國歷史及民族生命所繁，所以爲了保衛祖國，維擊正義，特攻隊員固早將生死置於度外，即其雙親以至於全國同胞，對於這種殺身成忍仁的榮譽行爲，也不感到有什麽不自然的地方。</p>
<p>訣別之話</p>
<p>第〇〇振武隊隊長中原少尉（陸軍士官學校畢業），是七個弟兄中的老大哥。他在出擊的前夜曾對記者說：「現在，什麽都不想，頗有返老還童之感！」同隊的谷榮少尉（日本大學畢業）等對於隊長這句話，也表示「深得吾心」。他們異口同聲地說：</p>
<p>「現在的心緒，是無從說明的。特攻已不祇我們，大家都將成爲特攻隊啦！」</p>
<p>在第二次總攻擊第一天出擊的粟津少尉（京都帝大畢業），曾留下了如左的話：</p>
<p>「我們之走出這個幕，從最初起，就很自然。」</p>
<p>的確，對於每個日太人，完成了國家賦與的使命，便是生存於祖國的歷史及民族的生命中。這個道理，用言語是難以說明的，芷如對於飯糧所懷的感激心情一樣，祇能意會，不能言傳。從而欲使敵國人理解這種特攻精神，唯一的辦法就是在決戰塲上將敵方的物量摧殘無遺。敵軍在菲島方面嘗到日本特攻戰法的滋味以後，就已發出悲鳴。在冲繩決戰中，他們對於日軍特攻的恐怖，更爲顯著。舉一個例，爲了防備日軍特攻隊的攻擊起見，他們用格拉曼機密張警戒稱，以種于島附近爲第一綫，奄美大島爲第二錢，冲繩本島周圍爲第三綫。在其機動部隊的周圍，常出動其所有空軍勢力的半數，擔任護衛警戒之　。敵軍目前以大半的兵力來防禦日軍的特攻攻擊，然而仍不免遭遇天損失。時至今日，敵方也不敢再說日軍的特攻戰法是自殺戰法了。</p>
<p>必殺戰法</p>
<p>第〇降魔隊的大內隊長，於出擊的前一天，曾對基地的作戰參謀力陳他對於特攻機所載炸彈量的主張。參謀說祇可搭載〇公斤，但他却力主可以加倍，即〇〇公斤。參謀證特攻機裝有副油箱，如果再要裝載大內中尉所說的〇〇公斤炸彈，一定難以離地。</p>
<p>「那末，議我自己來實騐一下吧。」</p>
<p>於是立即要求上峯許可，在參謀及該隊全體的面前，舉行敢死的試騐飛行，結果竟告成功，戴着〇〇公斤炸彈的特攻機，居然平安無事地昇空。假使這個實騐失敗，明天要統率部下衝擊敵艦的大內中尉，或許會喪失其寶貴的生命的。大內中尉爲什麽要冒着這稱危險而希望增加炸彈的搭載量呢？是不是因爲被選爲特攻隊員後就將這條命丟掉了嗎？不是的。第一，大內中尉以爲不問怎樣重，祗耍能够飛起來，那末以後就不成問題了，因爲特攻機的出擊總是一去不預備再歸來的。特攻隊員準備死的心境，於此充分流露出來。第二，他以爲炸彈越戰得多越好，因爲如此實行拚　時，所得的戰果也可更加確實一點。</p>
<p>完成任務</p>
<p>不過，特攻隊雖抱必死的決心，但第一要素的還在於完成所負任務，所以決不是衝入了就完事，務期由此而將決定的打擊加諸敵軍。這就是特攻精神的眞　。</p>
<p>在出擊的前夜，基地上舉行肅穆悲壯的壯行會，大家喝着冷酒，莊嚴地。該隊的間中軍曹（少年飛行兵出身）喝了幾杯冷酒，慷慨感激地說道：「我們的隊長傎偉大哪！」對於大內中尉的實騐成功，表示非常感謝。他那副神情，至今猶歷歷在目，使我永遠不能忘懷。實在的，該特攻隊的全體隊員，對於增加炸彈搭載量宜告成功的這件事，都感到異常喜悅。</p>
<p>在基地方面，有人稱飛機爲「天機」。至少在今日，日軍的特攻戰法是由飛機來充分發揮其威力的。日軍的特攻精神，祇有在獲得飛機時才能完全發揚其精華。以建國以來歷代相傳的犧牲精神爲經，以最近代的攻擊武器飛機爲總，交織成最偉大的最瑰麗的一幕。在此民族興亡的關頭，假如沒有和萬朶櫻花爭艷的舉世無雙的特攻隊點綴其間，那就太平淡了。（宮本報道班員）（譯自四月十九日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3 id="c55">最後的電訊 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>高的小丘脚下，　開橫穴。道個洞府，便是對空通信所的所在。夜是深了，隊長市橋少尉及其部下的通信兵，全心全意捉取特攻機拍出來的最後的無錢電報，不停地扭旋着收信機的刻度盤。以渡部曹長機爲隊長機的振武特攻隊若干架，於廿七日某時某某分，在滿月的蒼白光茫下，連翩出發，到現在已有〇小時了。「該已到達目標物的上空了吧？」雖說是甫國，到了夜裏，可也寒氣砭骨。這批在深夜從基地出發襲擊的神　們，果能成功嗎？洞中的人沒有一個不懷着深切的懸念，沒有一個不抱着虔誠的期望。通信兵的頭上，套着耳機，靜心屛息地凝聽，身體一動也不動</p>
<p>市橋少尉看了一看　，忽然低聲說道：</p>
<p>「今天特攻機的拂曉攻擊，在此基地還是第一次。從這裏到冲繩本島，距離在六百公里以上，而且還要巧妙避過敵方夜問哨戒機及討厭的夜間戰鬥機，一直飛到目標上空，道在不慣於洋上飛行的陸驚，實在是件難事！」</p>
<p>不過，道次渡部曹長帶去的飛機雖然不多，但隊員都是少年飛行兵出身，全有一千三百小時以上的飛行經騐，手腕是很熟練的，而且都充滿了自信</p>
<p>「來了！」突然，一個通信兵打破了洞裏的靜寂，喊了起來。時鐘的指針恰停在〇時〇〇分。吱·吱·吱！……虫鳴一般的電波流一完，就淸晰地聽到特攻機發來的信息。</p>
<p>「我們突入了！」這是第四號機武田軍曹發來的最後電訊。</p>
<p>這時，想必他們正面對着敵人猛烈的對空砲火的彈慕，勇敢地抱着必中的巨彈·向敵艦衝去，　它同歸於盡吧。</p>
<p>武田軍曹的電訊就這樣斷了。他是廿三歲的靑年，出擊以前曾在記者的紀念册上寫下這麽幾個字：「我們虛誠祈禱祖國永久的光榮，抱着必中的願念，出　了。」</p>
<p>在出發的預定時刻以前，隊員們或則專心調查氣象圖，或則硏究飛往目標上空的航路，態度是那末恬淡安閑，彷彿是試騐飛行，毫不興奮。唯有這種超越一切利害和慾望，祇　爲了保衛祖國而　劇一身的純忠的特攻精神，才能够使靑年隊員達到古　僧似的生死如一的悟道境界。當記者想到在數小時以前談笑自若的靑年勇士，現在竟已幽明隔世的時候，更深切地感到戰爭的嚴酷現實。</p>
<p>市橋少尉及其部下的通信兵，也在靜靜緬懷那批昇天而去的靑年壯士吧</p>
<p>沈默又統治着這個洞窟。約過了二十分鐘，收信機收到了二號機橋本軍曹的最後報告，那種悲壯的靈的呼聲，假着微弱的電波，一聲聲傳到了這裏</p>
<p>「幹啦，幹啦！」不知那一個通信兵竟精不自禁地喊道。</p>
<p>橋本軍曹可說是鬥志的權化，精神非常飽滿。二十二日出擊時，曾和隊長片岡中尉一同從這基地起飛，後因發動機出毛病，祇得中途折回。「可惜可惜，竟比隊長和戰友遲一步，實在無話可說！」那天以後，他老是這樣說。到了今日，他又第二次出發了。他唱着自撰的歌詞「人機暮進，必死衝突一，不止不期空母轟沉」，勇敢地向敵艦撞去，化爲護國之鬼，　了平生夙願</p>
<p>耳機簡直將通信兵的耳　也壓痛了，他們還是全神貫注他等待特攻機的電訊，可是一同從基地出發的渡部，下手兩曹長的飛機，却始終沒有音訊。</p>
<p>這一天，武田，橋本兩軍曹所駕的特攻機，在冲繩本島附近轟沉了一艘航空母艦和一艘驅逐艦似的敵艦。（小山田報道班員·譯自五月二日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c56">兩月來之建設行政 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 徐季敦</p>
<p>戰時體制之實施，莫要於行政簡素化，而行政簡素化之原則，不外節省人力物力之虛耗二一。疊者本市公用，工務，分局而洽，機構雖殊，而用實相近，譬如修築道路，疎叡河渠，工務局之事也，而涉及公用；敷設路軌，裝置電綫，公用局之事也，而涉及工務；蓋皆建設範圍內之事也。是以事務難分，職權易淆，重複衝突，在所難免，匪特人力物力，兩不經濟，抑且相互牽制，反　進行，此本市工務，公用兩局，合倂爲建設局之徵　也。</p>
<p>溯自建設局成立以來，季敦不敏，膠　局長重任，受命之處，稟於上海地位之重要，人口之衆多，對於工務公用等建設事業之需要，自較他處爲尤迫切，如給水給電也，工廠機械也，水陸交通也，路政，防水也，營絡，園林也，檢騐事業也，靡不與居民之生活，有密切之關係，各種建政，如能順利推進，市民自咸蒙其福祉，否則貽害亦有不堪設想者，然建設之事，非易言也，　値茲戰事方股，物料經費，均極貧乏，而機動工具，尤感困難之時，季敦謹本「急則治標」之訓，先視目前需圖誇張，實事求是，凡力之所能及，彌不殫力以赴，茲謹將兩月來各種設施之點滴，略陳於後，幸海上名達，有以敎之。</p>
<p>調整本局各辦事處：本局各辦事處係前工務局時期所設立，分佈於滬北，南市，市中心，浦東四區。其時各辦事處之工作，以工務爲專職，自本一局。並鑒於各區在公用局時期，亦有附屬機關之設置，爲本行政簡素化之原則，即將　公用局所設滬北車　登記所，滬北船舶登記所，歸併於滬北辦事處。南市車輛登記所，南市船船登記所，歸於於南市辦事處。浦東車輛登記所，歸併於浦東辦事處。並將滬西車輛登記所擴充爲辦事處，兼辦工務。將各區管轄範圍，明白劃定，自四月一日起已實行矣。</p>
<p>調整各　頭管理所：本市沛江與蘇州河縱橫貫通於市區之內，岸綫修長，碼頭林立，過去僅設一管理所，專司各碼頭之管理事務，殊難收效。本局成立後，即依事實之需要，將浦江與蘇州河一帶，分爲南市，外灘，蘇東，蘇中，蘇西，　　六叚，每叚各設碼頭管理所一處，以便就近管理，此後碼頭事務，常能漸上軌道，力謀整飭也。</p>
<p>電氣及給水事業：水電爲市民日常生活所必需，管理如不周密，影響於社會之安全，與市民之健康至鉅，本人就職伊給，即對電料商及承裝人之登記，新裝電氣給水工程之檢驗騐，均經格執行，並隨時派員曉諭市民海童　理。又最近市民以自來水量，供給減少，並以防空之需要，紛紛開掘土幷及防空井，本局爲指導協助及便於監管計，亦經訂定登記辦汰，公佈施行。至於路燈，於夜間交通，防空，防盜，等，均有密切之關係，本局自接管舊一區路　以來，巳逐步加以整頓，並注意修理及維護，因協助防空於是設法減低　光，減少不必要之路燈，並可節省電力，又市民報告路燈損壞辦法等，施行以來，成效尚者。</p>
<p>管理機械工廠業務：自本市電力供給，一再減少後，各工塲及公共塲所，自裝原動機以解決動力問題者爲數甚多，其裝　是否合格，實足影響公衆之安危。本局爲確保工業安全，增進生產效率起見，認爲有加强取締之必要，業經訂定取締規則，呈奉市政府明令公佈施行，並規定凡雇用工人十人以上或使用動力之工廠，除須向經濟局登記外，其內容設備，一律須向本局請檢騐，經檢准給照後，方得使用，又關於工業災害之調查，及工廠設備之改進，亦均在積極計劃進行中。</p>
<p>前工部局時代，會舉辦機械技工及鍋爐火夫訓練班，卓著成效，本局現亦在計劃恢復中，一俟籌有端緒，當即公告招生焉。（未完）</p>

<p>— 平世</p>
<p>讀到市政周刋江君的一篇「關於提早結來」的文章，覺得很對。在現今動盪的局面下，讀一日書，即得一日所學之知識，萬一時局發生變動，即失去求學的機會。假使現在提早結束，實行三學期制，暑期繼續上課，則可貴的二個月，不致白白的消磨掉了。暑期上課在目前是値得提倡的一個辦法。</p>
<p>或者人們會說，暑假裏讀補習班或在家中自己溫習功課不是一樣的嗎？不過這種滋味我已嘗過，自己溫習或上補習班總沒有上正規踝來得專心，並且得益也少，况且現在求學多麼困難。假使實行了三學期制，本來中學讀六年才能畢業，在三學期制之下就只要四年了。在戰爭體制下，一切以迅速，經濟爲上策，尤其是時間之經濟，更應加以注意，學生造就得越快，那麽社　的人才也越多，何况戰後需要人才去建設，所以即使爲國家計，爲學生計，爲敎員計，都是有益無損的。</p>
<p>我們學生希望服務於社會的心非常迫切，我以學生的資格，懇求敎育當局能够體念今日學生之學業與敎師之生活，對實行暑期繼續上課的辦法，加以考慮與研究。</p>
<h3 id="c58">創設中高等義務學校 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 姚</p>
<p>在我國設立義務敎育已有相當的歷史了；然大都是完全小學，中學或大學事亦有若干免費學額之設置。務小學設立之目的是嬰剷除文有但在中學，尤其是大學裏設立免費學額僅僅寓有獎勵性的作用；故對於員有志於學而家境貧寒的靑年學子們，並無多大裨益的。一般人談到我國的敎育問題時，都以爲應普遍興設民衆義務學校以掃除文盲；但是·另一方面，我國缺乏高等敎育專門人才也不容忽視。因爲我國，尤其在和平區內無論在政治，經濟，建設各方面，都要需要着大量受過中高等敎育的專門人才，以爲復興家，建設和平區的中堅；以與世界各强國相互追逐競爭。</p>
<p>不容諱言，我國的大學敎育，除了少數國立學院所收費用較低廉外，學費的高昂已使大學成為少數富有階級的尃利品。眞肯刻苦造就的靑年，大多數家境清寒。無力繼續擔負，不得不走入社會裏去求生活，進一步講，國立學院雖取費比較低廉，但因日問授課關係，對於不得不一面工作一面求學的靑年，仍不能適合。故事者主張爲　高國民智識程度，或附設於各學校內。此類義秋學校以國立·省立或公立爲宜，經常費用如不足，再由社州會團體及私人補助；所設學科以科爲主，課程採學分制，分必修選條兩類；授課以下午四時後及早晨九時前最妥，以便適合失學靑年的業餘時問；每學期規定選修學分，修畢則卒業。</p>
<p>至於各學院所聘敎授應尚實際，不以虛名爲依歸；因爲有若干敎授，徒有博十等學位虛名，而其所有學識，尚不及對某項科門有專門硏究的學者精湛實用。如環境許可，在每星期期內選一節時時專門臨時聘請校外的名學者或專家來校作公開的學術講演之用；同時增設圖書館以備就學者置外參考，使學者能得到事半功倍的效果。</p>
<p>此種中高等義務學校創或後，不但可使有志的失學靑年在業餘得有一個應（會去繼求造深，並且還能促使一般年長者亦有機會來求些新的科學知識。這樣一來，眞可辦到移風易俗的功效，使整個社會國家有了一翻新的氣象，踏上復興中華的大道。</p>
<h3 id="c59">讀「保甲與治安」後 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 江瑜</p>
<p>請陳彬龢先生「保甲與治安」一文（文見五月十三日申報代論）後，筆者略有感想；誠如陳先生所說：「今後上海之形勢不免更趨於緊張「並且」戰爭之火燄可能逼近上海」。臨此日趨緊張之時勢，如何加强「人民自助自治自衛之基本組織——保甲工作」，實爲首要。</p>
<p>數年來，保甲工作在當局苦心經營及社會熱心人士極力協助下，成績昭著（如組織規模建立，與各方面服務）但「保甲組織尚未充份發揮其協力治安之作用」亦顯爲事實。</p>
<p>竊以爲欲使保甲健全，治安鞏固，除陳先生提議本「有錢出錢」之旨外，尚須全市市民之「有力出力」積極響應各項工作，尤須全市之優秀市民參與各項服務，庶保甲與市民融爲一體，而收其協助治安之效。其中尤盼望當局能儘量吸收各地區之優秀靑年參與保甲各項服務，蓋靑年人富有朝氣，活力，且熱情純潔，如使之就近協助其本地區之保甲工作，既有俾於工作，又可以訓練靑年之才能，寬爲兩益。輩例以言，目前各保甲之「模範隊」「特別自警國」等組織，參加人數不多，規模嫌小，爲適合今後時勢之需，應將各保甲區域內之靑年壯丁，進行普遍之組織與施以短期訓練。</p>
<p>又如「消防隊」「急救隊」之組織，亟應擴大。此項工作巳略有成就，如黃浦分局對於職業靑年之積極訓練，可爲各區之模範。爲適應今後頻繁之空襲環境，各保甲區，曁各團體，及機關學校，應立即仿照進行是項訓練。</p>

<p>夏令已廚，在此人烟稠密之上海，我對衛生問題略舉數點，以供參考。</p>
<p>強化清除工作　近之而起，且有數處輒發見當局隨時注意設法淸除。</p>
<p>審查食品淸潔凡肉類，牛奶，蛋類在夏季所含細菌較多，茍不愼重檢查，每易致病。審查者須絕對破除情面，嚴格會一施檢查。</p>
<p>撲滅蚊蠅　蚊蠅之繁殖力甚强，在此初夏，應未雨綢繆，會同保甲機構，發動撲滅蚊蠅運動。消除汚積穢水（如路旁及防空壕內所積者）。</p>
<p>努力防疫　虎列拉，白喉等防疫注射，現已開始，未注射者仍屬多數，亟應在市區要道及車站輪追檢查防疫證書，藉以推行防疫注射。</p>
<p>推廣衛生敎育我國人缺少衛生智識，衛生局可派有經騐之宣傳員在街頭或電台廣播一切夏令衛生應有之常識，華影當局亦有　製一二有敎育意味之電影，藉灌輸一般民衆以衛生知識。</p>

<p>— 劉桂元</p>
<p>當此戰爭遠入決勝階段，市民日常必需品，因來源阻滯，運應不　；價格飛騰，甚至令人有不能喘息之感，若長此演變下去，誠將不堪設想，市當局有鑒於此；乃組設「疏散委員會」，辦理疏散事宜，可謂當務之急。但是筆者認爲尚有幾點有望於疏散委員會者：</p>
<p>疏散委會曾指定：「凡市民欲離滬者，可去各該同鄉會登記……」此條對於有同鄉會及參加同鄉會組織者，常然不成問題；可是我相信一完還看有無同鄉會及向來未參加同鄉會組織者，此類市民，敝意應請其直接到疏散委會辦理申請，勿需再組織同鄉會或辦加入同鄉會種種于續。</p>
<p>關於車船票事，疏散委會向車站輪船公司當局及各旅行社交涉，凡持有「疏散旅行證」者，須另行排隊順序購票；也不得故意推托或刁難。</p>
<p>「市民疏散旅行證」上除本人照片或指紋外，更需設有携帶物品一欄，記載所携行李件數及性質，以資沿途軍警隨時檢騐，是否與所載相符，倘有謀利或遠禁物品，立即將其扣留法辦之。</p>
<p>解決疏散市民交通工具：船是不或問題，火車請疏散委會轉向華中鐵道請能能否在普通列車行列內，附掛一四十噸之鐵栅車；專乘被疏散之市民。</p>
<p>市民除申請「市民疏散旅行證」外；在所居地區聯保辦事處，也當辦理戶口移動證明書，該項證明書也應詳載所攜物品；俾與疏散委會所發致「市民疏散旅行證」互為印證。</p>
<p>疏散委會對於有意回籍而無力者，應令其除具保甲證明外；在可能範圍內，得再覓舖保作證，以便衡情資助。</p>

<p>— 佐其</p>
<p>五月十三日申報載有短評「自來水應放寬限制」，呼籲自來水公司應照公衆生活上最低需要之程度，另立比較合理之限制標準。此爲刻不容緩之問題。</p>
<p>水量必須增加至理由·有下列各點：</p>
<p>電力供給，因日長夜短之故，需用已少，水量需要，不唯不能減少，抑且隨天時炎熱之關係而增多</p>
<p>電有代用品，水之代用品——井水——內含細菌極多，不堪食用，水量不數，勢必不得不應用，與衛生當局之「防疫」有妨。</p>
<p>不得已超越水量限度，難以負擔巨額罰款，其居民曾在報上呼籲，「彼住在一共十七居戶之里弄中，最近一月依最低需要量用水，被處五百餘萬之罰　，每人約數千元，實不勝負擔。」此爲限度過低之影響。</p>

<p>— 林一松</p>
<p>八年了！大哥結婚前幾天的一個晚上，在客　裏母親不在家，父親對大哥說了這樣的話：「你不能選擇你自己的母親，可是這一次我希望你代你的孩子們選擇了他們的母親。」</p>
<p>我後來知道那是父親製用別人說過的話，當時我是十二歲，記得父親話說完了，大家都陷入深思中，我不十分懂得父親對大哥說話的用意，房問中生着熊熊的火　，我覺得心坎中似乎有一股寒意。</p>
<p>父親是建築工程師，職務上的需要美，使他在來京滬滬杭甬綫上，在家的時間不多，每逢他到家，還把十幾歲的女抱起來呢；傢伙總的傢具都是他自己別出心裁的設計，桌椅都沒有角，他怕我們走路　痛了，只有一隻三角櫃有三隻角，卻不會碰到的，那是放在牆角的，又可以大省地位</p>
<p>父親是追麽愛他的孩子，可是我們除了物質上的享受外，過著很靜寂的生活。母親愛打麻將，一星期有五六天在朋友親戚家「劈劈拍」，其餘的一兩天在家，也是「劈劈拍」。而且高朋滿座，我們看見母親的臉，却沒有接近母親的機會。母親從外而歸來，有時也帶些咖啡糖輕氣球，那是我們第二天早上枕邊看見的。母親回來是深夜，我們都早巳入睡。我們夢見母親吻我們時，也許母親的嘴脣正印在我們的臉頰上呢。</p>
<p>戰　　發以後，父親，大哥和大嫂，母親和我　旅三地。母親的「雀侶」大都星散，我持毅力承隙而入，重新獲得了一位母親。</p>
<p>我生平只有兩大志願：一是顯壺行醫，一是執敎鞭作育英才，當我在大學裏念醫科時，回家「敎育」我的母親。</p>
<p>外祖父有「女子無才便是德」的思想。因此母親只念了極短時候的書。不過中國字多數是像形會意的，她又很聰明，所以報　信札都略能閱讀，可是不能執筆　寫。她能看父親和大哥的遠地來鴻，我寫的覆信她不够親切，自己却又不會寫。要一個成年的人，尤其是主婦。每日練小楷是不可能的，她的目的只在學會寫她要用的字，那一木帖子是這用的呢？</p>
<p>母親看完了信總要說幾句話，雖是自　自語，總不外乎回答信中的意思，我把她說話的口吻竭力保存，寫成草稿給她抄，起先她只能完全照抄，後來漸能按自己的意思更改。母親的好勝心很重，她不願以幼稚的書法示人，這樣抄了半年多，方才第一次發借給父親。</p>
<p>父親和我往來的家書稱爲例　，按日期編號奮發的，我寄出的是某某年滬某號，母親把　自已寫的信不分年份而編爲專某號，我覺得這個「專」字用得很好，可見她已能領略意會，不必言傳了。</p>
<p>此後我不再爲她擬信稿，信是一個月寫一二次罷了，她寫字的興趣有了，覺得練習的機會太少，因此學記帳和寫日記，起先也是和寫信一樣，由我擬了底子給她抄的，放學回家，我拿着筆聽她述稅日間的瑣事和銀錢來往，後來她能自己執筆，我只給她批改日記和核算帳目。爲了便利結帳的需要，她又學會了珠算，算斤兩時簡直是靑出於藍，她在小菜場上用慣心算，心算加珠算自然勝於單純的珠算了。</p>
<p>母親的日記每日只記一件事，晒荳　　的方法成績是一篇，姑母來過，她就把姑母有關的事湊上寫成一篇，似乎是把以前未上簿而在她腦海中的日記歸納起來記載，每日都能獨立成篇。我曾給她删改過幾篇，用她的傎名，在申報的衣食住周刋和家庭月刋上發表，她看到了十分高興，剪下寄給父親。父親覆信的鼓勵詞句中蘊藏了很大的喜悅，連我也被帶着了一筆：「這樣因地制宜的家庭敎師，眞是不可多得，不可多得！」</p>
<p>父親在上海時，家中有四個傭人服侍我們老爺太太少爺小姐四位，後來我們母女二人用了一個大姐，最後母親把大組也　去了，家務因她自已主持，反見幷非有條。母親黎明那起，先去料親晒台上的一角，那是她的園地，用肥皂箱　了泥土栽種植物，還養了幾隻母難。　　興　母親本來有的，我記得小時候家中庭于裏　了許多　時的花草，母親也常親手料理。現在大概感到物力艱難，一粥一飯來處不易，　花無力了，只種豆類瓜類蔬菜等，她常笑說是試騐時期，以爲他日歸晨的張本。也慎虧她澆水加肥有定時，居然頗有收穫，半斤重的南瓜，好幾把的豇豆都是收穫，種十顆毛豆收得六顆也未始不可謂有收穫了，母親說的，晒台上又沒有地氣，生長情形看得見也就是了！</p>
<p>我念的是醫科，醫學衛生方面的雜誌自然要劉覺，那裏面不時有比較淺顯的文章，母親看懂了頗能在日常生活中應用。納他命ABCD的軍要性和存在那一類食品中她都記得很牢，鹹菜時常用以佐膳，丙爲那是生命菜，當然烹調的方法不一，以免吃祇。蕃茄上市就當水果吃，因爲蕃茄內藏大量維他命C，烹調會破壞其存在，宜於生吃。……</p>
<p>母親現在有時也出去　戰，那只是偶一為之，並非以前那種日以繼夜的沉溺情形，到時候她自然回家，她能記得有家務在身，家務能維持　她的責任心，這就足夠了。</p>
<p>從前家中有花圈，還有三個會客室，我卻很怕朋友或同學來訪問，因為和家關係最密切的似乎是母親，而握的母親呢她不在家！家裏冷清淸的，我放學回去不是看盡就是到　；她在家，劈劈拍的，同學們聽見了，張開兩手在桌子上摩摩，問我會嗎？我就難堪極了。不是廢墟，就是俱樂部似的，還成其爲家嗎？現在可不了，你來罷！在我們的寢室兼客堂裏，母親坐在床上做衣服，床邊的小橙子上我坐着織絨綫，談談笑笑的。你來了會，我帮母親做點心請你吃呢！</p>
<p>我在母親膝下度晨昏時，實在是個稚氣十足的大孩子。我並沒有半點做作，那完全是流露自天性的。我獲得眞正的母愛不過五六年，五六歲的孩子，尤其是女孩子，不是還常牽衣扯　在母親膝下的嗎？</p>

<p>光陰如閃電般的過去，一剎那間榴花紅了便是仲夏季節。今年的夏季不如往日的炎熱，太陽光也不怎樣的灼人皮膚，所以今年的夏季如往日的春節一樣，眼看着宇宙間到處多充滿了活潑，興奮，在這綠蔭業生，芳草鮮美，江南草長，木茂鶯飛之時，更顯出那浩然蓬勃之氣慨。時代在不定的迴繞着，而人生亦在不定的變換着，如浮雲般的飄盪，不能預測的變化着，而在這宇宙間一個渺小的我，亦已由學生時代一變而爲坐寫字檯，過薪水階級生活的人了。每天終是做那些刻板無意味的工作，有時獨自想想，傎有說不出的憂悶和煩惱，心裏好似有萬蟻在爬，不能形容的感覺。回憶往日同學們大家歡聚在一起，嘻笑吵閙，種種不能磨滅的影子，常在我腦海中印起，如今各自分手，只有我一個人孤零零，每一想至此，惆悵，淒涼都湧在我的心田裏</p>
<p>在一個晨光微　的早晨，忽然我想起昨天校中大家計議著今天早上七時開始出發一塊兒到公園中去遊賞的日子，我立刻從　上一離而　，　　定後，急忙把昨日預備好的物件，麵包，水果，小刀球，……藏滿了袋中，急忙跑到預築的地方，那時已有好幾個同學在了。快近七點鐘的時候，同學們多已到齊了，各人騎了自由車，一路上　風　吹着，身上覺得萬分的凉快，舒適。一路上大家心中都覺得非常愉快，不一會兒已到了，因爲今天是假日，所以已有許參學生在遊賞着，那時我們正像一隻剛出　的小鳥，一個綫脫桎鐮的猴子，跳躍，奔　，莫不多是歡天喜地的。我和二三知友，仰躺着這天然的綠氈上，　着小鳥的歌唱聲，花香由微風中送入我們的鼻孔；那時太陽已近當空了，靑籃的天　着一塊塊有紫又紅的浮雲，好像如流水中的浮萍　逸，莫測她的變化，一會兒似一幅美麗的圖書，一會兒似一羣綿羊。一會兒又似天女散花般的，優閒而大自然的美，總不是人力所能創造的。　們一面欣賞着這盛人的美　，一而吃着帶來的乾點，水果，大家自由自在，無憂無愁，如身入極樂世界似的。等大家吃好以後，某同學發起爬山坡的遊戲，由士大家　樅著；談笑着，而我們的汗，和水一樣的浸潤了我們的皮膚，爆裂的日光隨時隨地的在汲取著我們身上每一部份的水份，皮膚爲日光所晒，發出反應的熱來。我們躱到一羣樹林底下，那兒是非常的幽靜，淸涼，樹林的旁邊有一小池塘，碧靑蔚藍的天，和潑淸的水對照着，水裏的倒影有小山，有樹，有天然的色彩，使他佈置得非常均勻，水好像玻璃一樣的透明，一直可分看到河底，許多的魚在悠悠的游着。時候好像太快似的，太陽已漸漸的向地平錢斜了下去，我們仍舊繼續的向土山上爬着，而天上的雲，和人情一樣的，由純潔的白雲，變成淡黃色，金黃色，也有解紅的，靑籃的天，漸漸便成了灤藍，大地上已籠罩了一陣　暮，黃昏快降臨了，窈窕的星在雲堆裏偸露着閃爍着，天是漸漸的趨入黯淡，但是大自然的美，越顯出他惑人的魔力，愈使人依依不捨的留　着。但是，那時正是我們同去的時候了，我們出了園門，大家各自道別而歸，沿路燈光照着我們的歸影。</p>
<p>回憶至此，身旁一切都覺得異樣的寂寂凄凄的永　，眞不知如何安頓。</p>
<h3 id="c66">控訴 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 黃沙</p>
<p>這時代，我們的情感太複雜了，正是這激盪奔騰的潮流，反映在我們的熱情的應覺中，正是這變幻的人事滄桑，刺激我們的純傎的心地，一天裏有幾個變化，每一分鐘有不同的感覺。</p>
<p>或者是自已太敏感些，或者是自已的生長經歷着憂惠，或者是自己把一切事物看得太正經，或者是自己對環境的要求太勞刻，或者自己的生活徧於勞心，精神的遠超逾於物質的，因此種種，遂使得自己的情緒陷於不斷的激烈鬥爭。</p>
<p>激盪鬥爭的發生，就爲了這種雜的時代，有複雜的矛盾，這種予盾不是單純的情感問題，也不是單純的理智問題，有許多以爲理智很好可以克制的，有許多以爲正是情感可以發展的，事實却顯得沒有如此簡單。</p>
<p>自己所憧憬與禮讚的，却是自己所遠遠分離和告別的，甚至在夢寐中，亦不　你有半句　語，自己所愛慕所欽仰的，亦限制於事實，不能有可能允許您的傾訴和依戀。有自己所懷念着的故舊，有自己掙扎過來的前塵，故舊業已無消息，前塵已成灰沙，落在空寞和傷感中。</p>
<p>面對着現實，必需數起生活的勇氣，爲衣食爲應付為存在，祇爲了如此狹小的個人的一些物質事受，消耗　了自己的靑春，光陰。</p>
<p>職　就是爲解決生活而　的，現在是提高着一個頗合興趣和志願的職榮，自己曾有過爲這種生涯唯盡心照的誓願，直到目下，這靜願無變，自已在時日的積累中，亦似有所在技術上的收獲，然而，與自己本來的要來，是差得那麽遠呢！</p>
<p>最悲慘的被現實的限制，對一切問題的看法，應該是黑的，現在却必需是白的，其實是善的，却把它抹上罪惡的汚影，這樣的願倒是非，混淆黑自，在一個圓闊於世故的人，是無所謂了，在一個滿腔熱情人縱自想着用「冷靜的理智」來控制，勉强的寫着自己所不敢信任的，這種矛盾的心理，時時摧折着那個本來紳　的心地，給換上個「空虛而淡　的缺乏了正義感的幽靈」了嗎？</p>
<p>這豈是甘願的？</p>
<p>事實却是最正確的，官必需要你如此做，你便不露顯慮，多疑惑多恍惚是有損害的。－－這亦是種理論，運種現實主義的看法，是最後的結論</p>
<p>問題却並不如此結束，工作之好，尚有着許許多多零碎瑣屑的生活問題，衣食住行的解決，便足够使一個薪水者增添了數不情的煩惱，都市的季節是多變的，都市的物質慾望亦是可怕的，而生活在都市裏，便不得不爲奪取　物質的率受而耗去了全部精神。</p>
<p>童年的熱忱和美麗的憧憬，將隨自己額上的皺紋而老去了嗎？</p>
<p>陷入個人的泥汚中，僅僅是爲了如此狹隘的利益而向舊社會屈膝了嗎？</p>
<p>這豈是甘願的？</p>
<p>愛的，恨的，新的，舊的，眞理，邪說，事業，前途……</p>
<p>種種分割不開的矛盾交織成了這時代中靑年人的心緒。在這種種矛盾中打滾的靑年，每天每時，都是在極度尖銳的都鬥爭中的，因此，與奮，　喪，歡喜，悲哀，希望，　　，恍惚，徬徨，徘徊……一天有幾十個變化，每分鐘的情緒是不同的？</p>
<p>情緒的弓弦拉得太緊，總有　斷的一天。埋藏在心底矛盾的激流，總有決　的一天。</p>
<p>那時候，或者正是這時代毀減的一天。</p>
<h3 id="c67">塵埃 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>惠民懶散走上棋，在門前駐下脚。他無意瞥見那貼在門上滿面塵埃的姜尚繪像，不禁打個寒噤。那張髪子臉在曖昧的幽暗中冷然瞧着他。在這兒住了這些年頭，他忽然領悟到這幢屋子的陰森和寂寞。一道陽光從灰濛濛的天窗裏瀉進來，塵埃閃爍，浮起又沉下。角落裏一隻花白貓蜷縮起身子，培動觸鬚，瞇眼望着他，似乎在責問：「你幹嗎驚醒我的午夢？」空氣中縈繞着一般沉　的烟香，惠民想：</p>
<p>「那老頭在抽烟！」於是輕輕叩敲起門扉，下意識地按善耳朶蹄聽。</p>
<p>蒼老的咳聲答應了他·</p>
<p>「爹，……」開了鬥，他逡巡走向古雅的籘榻。</p>
<p>「爹，……</p>
<p>有話說罷！「父親沉着氣回答，慘黃的燈光映着他那灰敗的臉，顯很陰沉沉逼人。</p>
<p>惠民又打了個寒噤，支吾着：</p>
<p>」我想明天或者後天動身到蘇州去……」</p>
<p>「嗯……」</p>
<p>「那裏有個差使！」猶豫着，兒子從衣袋裏摸出一封信來，呈向老子眼前，附註道：「一位老同學寄來的。」</p>
<p>老頭兒似看非看地，對着信紙發楞。半擲沉默，又突然厲聲喝道：「你那付樣子就不像能在官應裏幹事；歟着領子，戴睡帽，穿拖鞋，鎭日價吊兒郎當，好吃懶做又嗜賭！你籠到那裹去做事！」</p>
<p>惠民就像當兵的上操，站得筆直。偸偸地脫下睡帽。</p>
<p>「有姓李的道末一個人？」老頭兒又緩緩地間道、</p>
<p>「是老同學。」兒子躬身道：「我那敢欺蒙你老人家？」</p>
<p>「你不敢欺蒙我？你想我不明白你的心思！這兩天你的心又在活起來，想到外邊去　好事！知子莫若父，我會猜不透？你要去，就去罷！」</p>
<p>「爹……」檫着手，揉着手，不知怎樣說是好。另一處瞌上眼，意示；「你下面的話白講！」</p>
<p>沉默！竹籤深重，室內陰沉沉，烟燈抖動着辭淡的光幅。</p>
<p>「我想……惠民想拾起話緒。</p>
<p>「你想，你想問我要錢是不是？」老頭的雙　就像汽車頭上的兩盞燈。</p>
<p>專民一楞，就撲地跪在榻前：</p>
<p>「爹！你就再顧望我這一回吧！這次出外，我」定好好地幹一下。在家裏等了這些時候，我完全痛悟以前的過錯……」</p>
<p>他不知該用那一種情調訴說下面的話，在這種塲合，你要表白心曲，不是很爲難的事嗎？你淡然處之吧，他說你不把懺悔當一回事；你又哭又號，頭得很悲痛吧，他又會嫌你虛僞。惠民低泣了一會兒，開始垂下頭——沉默是金，他懂得父親的心理</p>
<p>惠民輕快地走下樓，一位小說家會這樣形容他的心境：就如溫熙的朝陽撫摸着的大地。他在轉角處停了半　。</p>
<p>「阿民，買了票就回來！」那老頭兒叮囑道。。</p>
<p>「你老人家放心好瞬！」他朝那斑剝的黑門撅撅嘴，于是跨入自己的臥室。</p>
<p>妻激動地迎問：</p>
<p>「老爹答應你了？」</p>
<p>「　！」惠民拍拍袋裏的鈔票；「馬上就去買軍票。」</p>
<p>「我說……我說你這次出門，總得一心一意做事……」妻替他穿着皮鞋，一邊叮寧。</p>
<p>「你何必多嘮叨，難道不相信我？」</p>
<p>「不是不相信你，」妻太息道：「你知道這幾年來你，我以及孩子們所忍受的苦楚……」</p>
<p>惠民默默走向掛鏡前，扣上領鈕。</p>
<p>「苦難，羞辱折磨着我們！」妻接下去：「你我都消失了初結婚時那股熱烈的生的的氣……」</p>
<p>兩對眼睛注視着掛在鏡旁的結婚照。</p>
<p>「孩子們也無辜蒙受痛苦，黑影攫抓住他們幼　弱的心靈！」她開始咽泣：「我記得我們剛從大學裏跨出來的時候……」</p>
<p>兩對眼睛又移向掛在另一邊的學士照。</p>
<p>「我們把婚後的生活想像得多麼的光明！」她伏倒在惠民的胸前。</p>
<p>「光明的生活就要開始了！」他撫摸着妻的柔變：「你知道我並不是個糊塗蟲呀！糊塗只不過在某一霎那佔領了我的腦袋，那時候妄想誘惑了我，　性在我的血液裏沸騰！可是，常那一霎那遛走了，我不還是十年前的我嗎？我愛你，我愛我們的孩子！痛苦就簡直使我憤不欲生！」</p>
<p>「惠民！最好你不要去！「妻緊緊抱着他：「當你在我身邊的時候，我感到有一種力量，使我信任你。但是，你別氣；當你一離開我，我就恐懼，我怕那一霎那又來了，妄想又誘惑了你！」</p>
<p>「你別懷疑，我這一回必定好好地幹！」惠民說：「我要把你和孩子從苦難裏拯救出來，離開這幅陰森而寂寞的屋子！」</p>
<p>以下的對話涉及到細小的問題，醫如行李，衣帽等等。我不逐句記下來了。</p>
<p>四點的時候，惠民整裝出去。他出了後門·又折回來。在樓梯下　聽了半响，偸偸走向廚房。從碗櫉裏拿出一只碗，用衣襟裏起來，擲下兩粒骰十——試試手氣。</p>
<p>「操他媽的，幹嗎還要來一手？」他忿然而去。</p>
<p>芷當惠民擲下兩粒骰子的時候，他的妻子撲倒在床上。她鳴咽着，激動地喃喃自語。她想當惠民歸來了，應該怎樣再鼓勵他一番。</p>
<p>不久，她漸漸入了夢鄉。她醒來時，掛鐘指着七點半、黑夜已在窗檻上窺探，她不禁戰慄了——他還沒歸來。</p>
<p>飯後，老頭子喚她進去。問她惠民回來沒有。</p>
<p>她回答道，顯得很平靜：</p>
<p>「他已經回來過，車票買來了。這响去見一個朋友，大概是商量差使的事。」</p>
<p>老頭懷疑地瞧瞧她，駡了幾聲，關照待惠民一回來，馬上來見他。</p>
<p>於是她又回到臥室，向窗外一望，就像正從噩夢中驚醒，惠民祇穿着一件單薄的內衣，赤着脚，踽踽徘徊在門外。他伸出了手——那曾屢以妄想兌換來幻滅的手，敲着後門。</p>
<p>「再饒恕我一回吧！」見妻子伸出頭來，他哀求道。衣寒襲骨，他哆嗦不停</p>
<p>現在，妄想兌換來幻滅；希望只開花在夢鄉裏。一霎那間毀滅；兩個人，另一個還在期待！這一天就如塵埃：從黑暗中浮起，又沉入黑暗中。而這一生就如這一天：希望又幻滅……</p>
<p>惠民跳脫不了這幢陰森而寂寞的屋子。妻偸偸一地放他進來，他　足走上臥室，倒在床上。</p>
<p>「難道這是你妄造出來的圈套，爲的是欺騙那老的？「妻哭著問，搖撼他的身子。他不作聲，逕</p>
<p>自然，他用不着回答；他自己編織了一個圈套，又自己套到頭上，把自已監禁在這種陰森而寂寞的屋子裏！</p>

<h3 id="c68">趣味性運動值得提倡的圓桌乒乓 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 錢旭滄</p>
<p>旭滄君是敎育家，但是他在體育壇上的貢獻，也相當的多。像中心球的介紹，圓門球的發明，在體育史上加上値得記數的一頁。他近來又硏究「圓桌乒乓」。這種遝動，頗爲新顯，也很有興趣。下面是他關於圓桌乒乓的文字，一定受護者歡迎的。　編者</p>
<p>那是兩年前的事，偶然在友人處看到一本外國出版的科學雜誌，無意間發現一張不甚淸晰的圓桌乒乓的照片。在照片的下面，印着一段小文，當時頗能引起我的興趣。可是說明太簡單了，又未附規則，這是引以爲憾的。過了一些時候，這樓有趣味的事，已忘記得一乾二凈了。近幾個月來，上海市况日趨蕭條，一些業餘消遺的地方，似乎都因營養不良而漸漸地　落了下去。乒乓房或彈子房，便取而代之。尤其是乒乓，到處風行，盛極一時。因此使我回想起了圓桌乒乓來了。有一天與體育界老前輩周家騏先生，張葆奎先生，和乒乓界先進陳霖笙光生，談起想要給上海愛好運動的人們，介紹一下圓桌乒乓的事，他們都表示十二分贊同，於是就增加了介紹和設計的決心。事實上道項就岡設計的工作，我是不勝任的。因爲我與這圓桌乒乓，既無一面之雅，又不知其家世來歷，只是在照片上略識其面影，僅知道在世界的那一方面，又產生了一件新的玩藝兒罷了。現在認眞起來由我介納，那只好憑自己的想像，給它構成新的內容，給它訂了暫行的規則。雖然不免有「橘逾淮而爲枳」之議，但使目前上海愛好運動的人們，在工作之餘多了一項趣味化遊樂的工具，那亦非細事了。好在這只是體育上的小品，並且將來重訂規則，也不無先例可援，所以便抽了點工夫，粗定規模，如果有人能付諸實施，對於扞格未通的地方，隨時加以修訂，那是我最大的希望了。</p>
<h3 id="c69">一·設備裝置 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>在球類運動中，乒乓球的設備，是可以算簡單的，　要備了桌子·網·板·網架·球五樣東西，就可以乒乓乒乓地熱鬧起來，那末圓桌乒乓的設備，和裝置，也並不複雜。</p>
<p>（甲）圓形乒乓</p>
<p>面不限何種材料做成，必須平滑，而且要有彈力性。彈力的標準，以距離　面三〇·五公分高落下的標準球，有平均二〇·三公分至二二·九公分的彈力性爲標準。圓擾面的半徑爲一·三七二五公尺。機面距離地皮的高度爲〇·七六二公尺。　面的安置必須水平。在　面檯脚的全部應該漆成不反光的墨緣色。在圓桌面的周緣應漆成以自邊起一·九公分闊的白色邊綫。三人制的圓桌乒乓，應該把圓形的桌面　分成三個相等的扇形每個扇形的弧度爲一二〇度，每個圓心角亦爲一二〇度，三條相等的半徑也用一·九公分闊白錢漆成。假使四人制的圓桌乒乓，那末把圓形的桌面分成四個相等的扇形，每個扇形的弧長和圓心角均爲九十度，原有三條半徑，那當然改成二條，互相垂直的直徑了。</p>
<p>（乙）乒乓圓柱</p>
<p>圓柱不限質料，三人制的圓桌乒乓，用四根圓柱，一根裝置在圓面積的中心，三根分裝在等距離的圓周上，柱項高出檯面爲一七·一公分，柱與　面應該成直角。圓柱的橫剖面直徑為一·九公分。柱脚不能橫伸出檯面。四人制的乒乓制共五根，一根裝置於圓心，其餘四根分裝在圓周上四等分處，注高與柱粗與三人制同。</p>
<p>（丙）乒乓綱</p>
<p>三人制的綱，共有三條，各自中心的乒乓柱分張到圓周上的乒乓柱上，斜隔圓桌面成三等區。四人制的網共有四條，裝置法與三人制同，垂直隔成圓桌面爲四等區。網的關度爲一七·二公分。網的顏色應爲白色。網眼應爲一·九公分見方。網的上邊應縫以一·九公分闊的有色網邊。網的兩端應緊擊於乒乓柱頂使網的上邊成水平爲合度。</p>
<p>（丁）球及球拍</p>
<p>球與球拍與普通乒乓規則上所載完全相同，故不再贅述。</p>
<h3 id="c70">二·規則內容 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>圓桌乒乓是從原有普通乒乓變化而來的，它所用的規則，當然與原看的規則大部相仿，但是因外形，地位，設備裝置和人數的不同，所以有些地方，也不能完全相同了。現在把各　的地方，列在下面。</p>
<p>（甲）三人淘汰制</p>
<p>這是同時供給三人玩的遊戲，下面是與普通乒乓不同的幾點：</p>
<p>一·（方位）三人應站立的方位，用抽籤法決定，第一名可以選擇優良的方位和發球權。第二名可以選擇次等方位，其餘的方位歸第三名。</p>
<p>二·（計分）普通的乒乓規則，採用得分制，三人制的圓桌乒乓，因爲三角聯賽的關係，應該變用失分制，三人中先失滿十一分者就算失敗一局，假使二人或二人同時各失十分時，那末應當以再失滿二分的人爲先失一局。</p>
<p>三·（發球）獲得發球權的，爲發球員，其餘的二人，均爲接球員。發球員先將球拋起，拿球拍拍擊，使球由本區域內彈起，而再越過網，落於左右任何區域內，謂之發球。下次的發球權出每次失分的人獲得。</p>
<p>四·（接球）接球的人，可以把球向左右任何二區內還擊，但是不能向同一區域內，連送三次或三次以上。據們例來說：第一次甲給乙，乙第一次也可還給甲，第二次甲可再給乙，乙第二次也可還給甲，第三次甲就不能再給乙，一定要給丙了，否則甲乙二人打到天亮丙二個人等到天亮，那豈非笑話。</p>
<p>五·（淘汰）三人甲首先失滿十一分的，就歸淘汰，算第三名。其餘二人因爲不能玩圓桌乒乓，就以失分的多少，以定名位的高低，失分少的爲第一名，次少的爲第二名。假使在第一個人淘汰時，而其餘二人積分適相等，那末去計算二人中最後失的一分，此分誰後失，誰第一。</p>
<p>（乙）四人淘汰制</p>
<p>關於四人淘汰制的規則，像方位·計分·發球·淘汰，均與三人淘汰制同，僅按球的範圍，略有變更。四人制不能向同一區域連送二次或二次以上，因人數增加一人，送球的機會也增多一區，進攻的範圍擴大，對於攻方是在在有利·在守的方面講，面積愈大，則愈　防守，大有人人自危的不安心理。那來向同一區域連送的次數，常然不能超過二次或二次以上爲宜，據個例稅：第一次甲給乙，乙第一次可還給甲，第二次甲就不能再給乙，必需要拍給丙或丁了。</p>
<p>（丙）四人雙打制</p>
<p>變打是兩人爲一組的對抗遊戲。雙方選擇的方位，和發球權，都用抽籤法決定。假使抽籤得勝的一組，願作發球者，或接球者，則對方有選擇方位之權，假使抽籤得勝的願選方位，則對方有決定先作發球者或接球者之權。但抽籤得勝者願意時，仍得將選擇之優先權讓其對手。同餘二人的站立方位是面對面形成一直綫。發球規則與前相同，拍擊的目標當然是向左右兩敵人進攻，但必要時也可以向對面同隊人區域內拍去，藉以休息候機乘虛直入，不過向同隊區域內不得連拍二次或二次以上。發球時不得向同隊區城內發出。計分方法採用得分制，與前節相反·雙方得分滿十一分者爲　一局。　　二勝以定勝負·發球權　用輸流制，與普通乒乓規則同，恕不再贅述。</p>
<h3 id="c71">三·優點 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>圓桌乒乓的規制，現與普通乒乓不同，因此也自有其優點和缺點，現在略舉數點如下：</p>
<p>一，圓桌乒乓是三人同玩或四人同玩的遊戲，間接可以養成機警的智能，因爲在兩面或三面受敵的當兒，不能不隨時小心翼翼去防範了。攻者便要隨時窺測敵方的間隙，施以突擊，而守方也要隨時窺測進攻的動向，施行昉守。雙方在這種緊張的環境下求生存，無形間便養成了機智的習慣了。</p>
<p>二，在一切的運動或遊戲比賽中，雙方都憑着功力·機智·機會，三點在爭鬥，往往三者實力懸殊，就不感興趣，同時弱者也很少有獲勝的機會。醫如奕棋遊戲，全仗功力與機智，一個功力與機智都不敵對方的人，幾乎可以說沒有勝利的，可能·圓桌乒乓的功力不像普通的　，即使一個沒有　　　騐的人，也可以勉强應付，利用機　的時候倒比着通乒乓為多，利用機會則均等。在雙方實力懸殊下，往往也可以拿「碰　角頭」的運氣足使對方陷於措手不及。所以我相信圓桌乒乓要比普通乒乓富於大衆化的性能。</p>
<p>三，圓桌乒乓頗遍用於中國家庭，因爲在中國備有大菜　子的家庭究屬少數，致於園　面却非常普通，在大家庭中假使需要添置圓桌面的話，不妨去添置一張二面用的圓桌乒乓（正而漆三人制反面漆四人制），飯後消遣，</p>
<p>所謂術生蔴雀有益多多。至於參加的人數比較普通乒乓爲多，這自然也是一點好處。</p>
<h3 id="c72">四，缺點 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>一，圓桌乒乓因受面積陝隘的限制，往往在拍擊時不能作有力的長抽，故不能運用普通乒乓所特有的精彩擊法。普通乒乓側重直綫長抽，圓桌乒乓應用左有弧綫刁扣。長抽是痛快，刁扣則乏勁。</p>
<p>二，圓桌乒乓因爲經多地位陜窄，觸綱自殺及越野的機會必較普通乒乓爲多，三五圓合，即　脫落，缺乏有趣咪的延續性，以致會減少玩者的興極</p>
<p>三，雙方攻守的面積成扇形，前尖後關，許多攻守的絕技，像正反抽球，　下急救，削球等均無從應用。因此玩者技術，養成乏味的單純化。</p>
<p>以上單就我知道了一點普通乒乓球的經騐　空給圓桌乒乓以新的內容，並逞臆設計，自然不免有閉門造車之弊。至於規則方面這裏只能舉其大要，詳細的須待另印奪册。希望乒乓、前輩，及對於圓桌乒乓有特殊興趣的人，能够隨時在實騐中加以指正。同時希望各學校及靑年會或各乒乓房，能够率先予以推行，如有疑問之處　可通兩商討。</p>

<p>飛隊大部爲趙家昆仲，與宜家班同仁隊劉家將華南有先後媲美之妙。蓋隊在其私宅中置有球架，故日夕操練，合作功夫自佳。第以年事均稚，氣力或有不逮·惟有籃球宿將徐志臺從中指劃，故屆時必能再接再厲，發揮無遺也。</p>
<h3 id="c75">二部龍華 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>龍華成立有相當歷史，戰績巳在水準以上。隊員中頗多爲前國光中學校友，故根底極好，先後得張錦　馬燦希爲指導，更見出色，陳　　陳正淼尤爲個中翹楚，對於總冠軍抱有野心。</p>
<h3 id="c76">三部飛馬 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>飛馬隊員頗　上進，努力異當，故能奪獲該部冠軍，絕非倖致。該隊前鋒吳俊貴射　甚好，後衛　恒興有獨到之處，全隊的功夫，似尚較遜，但以其苦幹精神，或有出奇制勝之成績。</p>
<h3 id="c77">四部幽鷺 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>幽　隊中如林鴻慈·王裕光等在籃球界已具相當盛名，自屬經騐勝人一等。日後之希望作爲者，賴有此者，實勝於其技術也。惟籃球比賽，基於經騐者亦重，職斯之故，該隊固亦大有希望。</p>
<h3 id="c78">五部誠孚 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>誠孚隊係誠孚公司問人所組織，每逢聯賽，均能參加，而從未有東權等情，故以前戰績平平，邇來則以迭經比賽，頗有進境。此次能獲得該部冠軍，誠不負苦心人矣·筆者極佩服該隊之精神可嘉，雖此番總冠軍未必有望，但有此收獲，亦足以豪矣</p>
<h3 id="c79">六部藍隊 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>藍隊昨倖勝信協後，獲得六部冠軍。查某中如史樵奎·朱仲麟在銀錢界確貝　望，他如徐坤幾吳漢樞為後起之秀，　新將老手於一隊，乃能得此成績。日後參加總決賽後，至少能有更佳之演出也。</p>
<h3 id="c80">七部振源 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>振源隊爲振源錢莊同人所組織，有翁文　之領導，公餘輙作練習，故球　一日千里，在乙組羣中，巳可稱爲　　者。不論個人技術與夫合作方面，均屬楚楚可觀，當亦爲有希望之一隊。</p>
<p>綜觀七隊類多後起之秀，日後相逢，各盡心力，其演出必可有新而目也</p>
<h3 id="c81">總決賽時客車表演 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>近悉乙組舉行總決賽時，將有籃聯諸老爺裁判隊，參加客串，茲聞並有力光籃球隊參加作三角對抗，力光隊係力報體育版同人所組織。隊員如東風，呂誠，紅塵，史　，球史公，黃蒂，馬耶，梅潔等俱屬老將身手。現力光隊已經成立，並在積極鍛練中，則屆時之噱頭必多。</p>
<h3 id="c82">排球聯賽報名截止　希望各隊踴躍參加 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>本屆排球聯賽，因爲塲地的關係，將由室內而移到塲外。筆者始終覺得，祇要沒有風的日子，室外實在比室內好得多。因爲發展容易，尤其是在救球的時候。所以我預料本屆的比賽，一定比過去來將緊湊，水準也一定會提高得多。但是迄至目下爲止，報名參加的隊數並不十分多，計甲隊有中北白隊三省等，俄僑和蘇維埃不知能否成軍。女組方面，則緣隊志　均有問題。三省和華嚴已報名參加。今天是報各最後的一天，希望各排球隊踴躍參加，使本届的排球聯賽，反因在室外而有更多的好成績。（懷　）</p>
<h3 id="c83">籃球學理述要（二十） <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>練地戰法，爲比較慢性之一種戰法，故又總名之爲緩攻法，乃在快攻不可能時，轉而採用之第二種戰法也。其優點，在於短距離傳球種健，能誘騙敵人，待機而進，並可反復行之。故最適合於程度較低，年齡較長·與賽至疲憊之球隊，及破五人聯防法。但其弱點，在開始攻擊，如用中央突破，將球擊地，在敵之中鋒脚傍反彈起，傳與斜　走前之同伴，使其在罰球綫上，搶在敵前接得此球，即反身旋轉，傳與兩邊綫走前之同伴投籃，或自行拍球上前投入，倘此三法均行不通，即將球傳回後衛，再覓機　進攻。</p>
<p>如用邊垂偷進法，則將球傳與沿邊綫走出之同伴，使其接球後，可轉身以背擋住敵人，同時將球立傳回後衛，留出空路，俾後衛拍球衝前投籃，或傳與向中央及籃角走前之二同伴投籃。倘此法又爲敵所阻，仍將球傳回後衛，轉移陣地後，再行第三次進攻。</p>
<p>此時或改用外攻內應法，中鋒走至籃下，與兩前鋒三人倂列在底綫，兩後衛在外互相傳球，在敵不留意時，兩前鋒引敵走前，而設法將之擋住，留出中鋒空在籃下，後衛即用過頂傳球法，傳與中鋒跳起投入，最妙能在空中托入。</p>
<p>倘敵方防衛深嚴，我方無可動彈，惟此時我方獲分較多，則可不再行進攻，而採用延誤時間戰，用外國互相傳球法，以保存獲球際。</p>
<p>其實陣地戰法，非不能克敵「人釘人」防守衛，而且戰情少變化，不及其他戰法之受觀衆歡迎。尤其在採用延誤時間戰之時，俗所謂「差麻雀」。故遇此情形，觀衆常報以「開汽水」之聲，蓋惡　乏味也。</p>
<p>陣地戰法，多不行急攻，常在本隊獲球後，交給兩後術運球前進，或用一人拍球，一人隨從護衛，或二人用短距離互相傳球，傳過中綫，待機而攻。兩前　於本隊護球後，則急跑至兩　塲角，引敵分散防守陣綫，中鋒則走至罰球綫上，或走近邊綫與罰球綫延長之處，以便佈置陣綫，及暗示由何人開始發動進攻。</p>
<p>陣地一俟佈　完成，即可開始誘敵工作。兩後衛不斷在陣前互相傳球，或旋轉，或互挨位置，或裝虛襲擊，將球傳至中鋒再傳出，擾亂對方視綫，使之無從捉摸，何時進攻，及由何處侵入。二前鋒，可沿邊綫及端綫往來跑，或與中鋒三人互調位置，斜角跑過罰球區，再沿邊綫走向塲角，成八字形走法，或成輸盤式走法，引敵離開位置，以便乘虛而攻之。</p>
<p>兩後衛一面互相傳球，一面發意襲　機會，一有空隙，即不放過，如此簡單，各種陣綫，非有圖示，不易說明。更非訓練有素，不能應用；此不過舉一例子而已。</p>
<h3 id="c84">丙·阻擋進攻法 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>阻壋進攻法，英文名為Blocking　Sysfem，又名掩護進攻法Screening，爲現代各種新戰法所參用之一種特破敵陣之戰衛，對於破「人釘人」防守法，及　界外球，最爲有效，其名稱甚多，有名爲主敵阻擋（Play　Key－man　Screening），單　刀及變剪刀形阻擋，邊垂阻擋，中區阻擋等法。擋人之法，有用一人，二人或三人阻擋者，須視乎比賽形勢，及指導員之經騐而定。但最常用者，當推主敵阻擋之一法。所謂主敵阻擋法者，即將主要之一敵人擋住，以便當出空路，俾持球之同伴，可以乘此路綫進攻，而不受敵人釘着之謂也。此法比較簡單易行，且可與其他各種進攻法參用，而無須改變其原來之全　戰策，故指導員常喜用之。不過此種戰法，非無弱點，其最顯著者，爲易被五人分區聯防法所克制，及行之不靈活時，每易爲對方察知。成竹在胸，可及時調換位置而抵禦之，致成徒勞之舉。</p>
<p>總明善戰之球員，於行阻擋法前，必先施用一種如放烟幕彈之處裝技術，使敵不知受擋，或佯作走前接球，或跟敵跑向籃前奪球，或立定高呼與作勢，要求同伴傳球·或指示同伴進攻方向，使敵不知其偽，而暗中將就近之敵人擋住，使之隔離於邊綫。或被困於某一地點，不能及時走出，奪搶同伴之球，使持球之同伴得以放胆進我。所以阻擋之法，首耍在　不使敵人預知被擋；　擋敵時所站之位置，須使敵不易及時出而堵截持球之同伴；　竭力避免觸及敵人之身體而犯規。查規則上，現已取消一切不發生身體接觸之防守禁例。換言之，祇須身體不發生接觸，任何阻擋方法，均可以且。於此對採用阻擋進攻法，更爲有利也。</p>
<p>採用阻擋法，破「人釘人」防守術，通當所佈　　綫，大概可分爲下列三種。</p>
<p>第一種屬於全塲作協法·假使於對方投中籃後，由我方在端綫，　界外球開始進攻。佈陣之法，用左衛在端綫　界外球，右衛站在敵方罰球區之左側，兩前鋒分別站於塲邊，近中綫之處，中鋒則站在本方罰球萬前之塲中，以分散敵人。</p>
<p>在開始進攻時，右衛先走向左前鋒塲邊，佯作覓路而走。其實上前將看守該前鋒之敵壋住，使左前鋒無人釘着，走前接得界外左衛　入之球。此時中鋒走向右塲邊處，又將看守右前鋒之敵暗中擋住，俾該前鋒走出接左前鋒傳球。左衛於擲界外球後，即從左塲邊，直衝向籃，在籃前接得右前鋒遠傳來之球，隨即投入。此法可與快攻，無中圈跳球，或擲界外球進攻法配合而行，幷可名爲邊垂阻擋，斜綫進攻法也。</p>
<p>第二種佈陣法，係假定用之於陣地戰之時。其佈陣方法，用中鋒及左右兩前鋒，三人橫列於前塲端綫之前，兩後衛則分別站於左右塲邊，近中綫之處，形成二人外攻，三人內應之勢。用此種陣勢進攻，方法甚多，茲舉一例以明其大概。</p>
<p>在開始進攻時，仍緣用普通陣地戰法，用兩後衛互相傳球，傳過中綫，其餘三人則急跑向前塲端綫佈陣·及至球傳過中綫，球在左衛手中之時。右塲角之前鋒，即綠邊綫開始走前，至球傳到右衛時，即忽然搶在跟隨上前之敵前，接得右衛傳球·此時，中鋒從籃下跑前一二步，將釘住左塲角前鋒　敵擋住，使該前鋒逃出，走至　前接得右前鋒傳球，即行投入　。此法乃主敵阻擋（Key－man　Screening）之一種。亦可謂二攻三應之主敵阻擋進攻法也。</p>
<p>第三種為　攻阻擋陣地戰法。其佈陣方式，適與前一種相反。為三人外攻，二人內應。除中鋒站在陣外兩衛之當中外，其餘各人之位置，均與前一陣綫冋。用此陣綫進攻之方法，可以千變萬化。現　其較爲簡單之一者，略為說明。</p>
<p>發動進攻之時，應在兩衛互相傳球傳過中綫之後。此時任何一衛，可將球傳與中鋒。球一到中　之手，右塲角之前　，即開始綠邊綫走前。　走到罰球綫與邊綫延長之處，即　在釘着自已之敵人前，以便接球。中鋒見彼已走前，即行將球傳與右衛。右衛接球後，向邊綫旋轉，隨將球傳興右前鋒。中鋒傳球與右衛後，跟踪走向右衛前，　作要求將球傳回，而暗中將釘住右衛之敵擋住。右衛傳球與右前鋒後，轉身繞過擋住敵人之中鋒後，走至罰球區，接回右前鋒傳球，即拍球上前躍起投籃。此乃三攻二應，邊陲主敵阻擋之進攻法也。</p>
<p>如用此陣終，改變爲中央突擊阻擋進攻法，則可在中鋒接得球後。右衛跑到釘着中鋒敵人之右側，用裝　法，偽作其他企岡，而暗中將敵擋住，俾中鋒可以繞過右衛之後，用單槍匹馬，拍球衝入中區，在近處籃躍起投入。此法言之甚簡，但在實行之際，非得全隊合作，引敵散開，使之不留意。若非右衛與中鋒深切合作，不易　效。（註）上期本文中，「總言之」至「抵　其變化莫測之擋人法」止一節，係現代防守法之結論。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Establishing the Foundation of Sino-Japanese Friendship and Bearing the Grave Responsibility of Defending East Asia: Remarks by Commander-in-Chief Fukuda <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Vice Admiral Ryozo Fukuda, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with representatives of the Shanghai press corps for the first time on the 18th. He declared that, in order to cope with the changing situation, the Japanese fleet in China would, with unwavering determination, shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending Greater East Asia and contribute to the establishment of close Sino-Japanese relations. The original text of his remarks is recorded below:</p>
<p>"I have been suddenly appointed to the important task of commanding the Japanese Fleet in China, and on the 15th of this month, I succeeded the distinguished General Kondo in Shanghai to take up this post. At a time when the war situation is tense, it is gratifying to see that the officials and people of China, Japan, and friendly countries are overcoming all difficulties and striving forward under the mission of building Greater East Asia. The seriousness of the war situation goes without saying. The intensification of the decisive battle in the Pacific, centered on Okinawa, and the rapid changes in the European situation will have a complex impact on the situation in the mainland from now on, making me keenly aware that the responsibility of the Japanese Fleet in China is even greater. I deeply hope that with the warm assistance and cooperation of all officials and civilians, the army and navy will unite as one to enhance our decisive battle strength, advance to complete the war, and thereby establish the eternal well-being of the Greater East Asian peoples. There is an ancient Chinese saying, 'Where there is a will, there is a way.' According to the nature of war, the occurrence of difficulties is inevitable. I am convinced that by maintaining a strong fighting spirit and combat power to the end, we will surely win the crown of victory. I deeply hope for everyone's efforts. Finally, I would like to say to you all that I served in the navy in China during the first revolutionary war in the 44th and 45th years of the Meiji era [1911-1912]. At that time, the trust and friendship between China and Japan left behind beautiful and close memories. Later, due to the work of the United Kingdom and the United States, Sino-Japanese relations gradually drifted apart, leading to the Sino-Japanese Incident and the current situation. Recalling this, I cannot help but feel regret. At this time, we can only establish the foundation of Sino-Japanese kinship and advance the construction of Greater East Asia with firm determination."</p>

<h3 id="e15">Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party Seek to Expand Their Own Military Strength <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Based on intelligence from Yan'an: At the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party held in Yan'an in late April, Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a military report speech after Mao Zedong's political report. Mao Zedong insisted on advocating the establishment of a coalition government, while Zhu De demanded the immediate establishment of a joint command in his speech. Zhu De first stated, "The Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Kuomintang army, local armies, and all forces must be closely united and cooperate with the Allied forces to carry out the war of resistance. To complete this task, a joint command must be established to replace the one-party dictatorship's command." Then he heavily attacked the Kuomintang army, saying that the Kuomintang army maintained the old system, old habits, and old tactics, rejected all necessary reforms for the war of resistance, placed its hopes for victory on the Pacific War and the Soviet-Japanese War, while it itself was passively preserving its strength in preparation for civil war. In his military report, Zhu De strongly asserted that the Chinese Communist army contributed the most to the war against Japan. However, analyzing its content, the Chinese Communist Party is less concerned with resisting Japan than with developing its own sphere of influence. The fact that both sides are now seeking to expand their influence, disregarding the suffering of the people, is extremely clear.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Improving Prison Administration <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Justice and Administration Wu Songgao and Mr. Li Sihao held a tea party yesterday to improve prison hygiene, earnestly requesting leaders from all walks of life to donate funds to reduce the suffering of ordinary criminals from disease. This is a humane undertaking that should be supported, and people from all walks of life should rise up to assist.</p>
<p>The establishment of prisons was originally a political tool adopted out of necessity, originally intended only to restrain a small number of villains and criminals, so as not to harm the group, and to have the same meaning as the compulsory admission of people with infectious diseases into isolation hospitals. Therefore, the highest ideal of sages and virtuous men in governing the government is the four words "simplified litigation and lenient punishment". Only during times of war, or during economic panic, is there an inevitable phenomenon of "prisons overflowing with prisoners." But in any case, criminals should not suffer extra-legal suffering beyond the punishment prescribed by law.</p>
<p>However, although this is the theory, in reality, judicial funding is tight, and most prison buildings are simple and crude, and do not meet the sanitary principles for prisoners. For thousands of years, I don't know how many people have died from punishments outside the law!</p>
<p>In recent years, judicial power has gradually become independent; on the other hand, due to the efforts of judicial authorities to rectify and improve governance, such as the former Minister of Justice and Administration Luo Junqiang, and the late Zhang Yunbo, especially Zhang Yunbo, who sacrificed his life to improve the lives of prisoners. Today, Minister Wu Songgao is governing as an expert, striving to improve prison administration, starting with improving medical and health care, being practical and realistic, and gradually achieving results. However, at this time when the government's finances are tight, the completion of improving prison administration depends on the donations and assistance of talents from all walks of life.</p>
<p>We believe that on the one hand, we must devote ourselves to improving the material lives of prisoners, supplementing and improving medical and health facilities, so as to avoid prisoners suffering extra-legal suffering. On the other hand, it is also unreasonable for thousands of criminals to sit around wasting national treasury funds and doing nothing. We recommend using adult prisoners for national construction and other possible undertakings. Although there are those who employ prisoners in prisons, either management is poor, or rewards and punishments are unclear, or the work chosen is not suitable for individual prisoners, resulting in twice the effort and half the results. In the future, there should be a complete plan to operate them in a timely and appropriate manner. Those whose work is authentic and whose achievements are excellent should be given special rewards, such as exemption from punishment, reduction of punishment, and other rights.</p>
<p>Among prisoners, we especially attach importance to the treatment of political prisoners. Regardless of how absurd their thoughts are or how illegal their actions are, their motives for committing crimes are not for the benefit of themselves or their families, so there are grounds for forgiveness. Moreover, all groups in the world generally give political prisoners special treatment, allowing them to enjoy different treatment from ordinary prisoners, giving them an opportunity to repent and reform. In particular, most of the political prisoners in the peaceful areas have more reasons to be pardoned than ordinary political prisoners. We should do our best to educate them to make them self-aware and renewed. We feel that it is not easy to cultivate talented young people, and we hope that the relevant authorities on both sides of China and Japan will pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>While discussing improving prison administration, we especially feel that the redress of wrongful imprisonments and the protection of released persons are even more important. We hope that relevant authorities and enthusiastic people will come forward to provide guidance. The maintenance of social order and the protection of human rights are deeply reliant on this.</p>
<h3 id="e20">A Visit to Shanghai Prison <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Rain Forest</p>
<p>Shanghai Prison, located at 147 Changyang Road, commonly known as Tilanqiao West Prison, is the largest in scale and most well-equipped among the three prisons in Shanghai—including the former Special Second District Masnan Road Prison and Caohejing Prison. Five years ago, the highest record of inmates it housed reached over eight thousand five hundred. Although the number of current inmates has decreased to around two thousand, the words "foreign prison" still maintain an indescribable color of fear and mystery, at least in a certain social stratum.</p>
<p>The Book of Documents says, "Be clear about the five punishments to assist the five teachings"; Lao Tzu also said, "If the people do not fear death, how can you use death to intimidate them?" Originally, the greatest function of a prison, besides punishing crimes, is none other than to liberate a criminal from evil, using methods of influence to make them repent and reform, and restore them to being a person beneficial to society and the nation. Therefore, the prison's facilities and the spirit of governing criminals should all adopt active measures. Cruel torture and inhumane treatment are, needless to say, unnecessary, and under the principle of "the people do not fear death," what good can they do?</p>
<p>Apartment-Style Buildings</p>
<p>Under the reception and guidance of Warden Shen and Deputy Warden Li, the reporter yesterday, in the limited time available, visited this large-scale abode of criminals. The architecture of Shanghai Prison involves concentrating several five-story steel-reinforced concrete buildings on an open space of approximately ten acres. Because the roofs are high and the buildings are magnificent, from a distance, they somewhat resemble a group of "apartments." Its layout is as follows: upon entering, a building serves as the warden's office, with the reformatory, hospital, and Loyalty and Filial Piety wards arranged on the left and right. Further inside, the center is the factory, with the Trustworthiness, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace wards on the left, and the Kindness and Love wards on the right, between which is the kitchen.</p>
<p>Inside these five large Western-style buildings, besides the officiating officials and guards, there are currently about two thousand male and female inmates, but in reality, about one-third of them have been transferred elsewhere to work, so the threat of "overcrowding," as it was five years ago, is no longer felt. According to Warden Shen, he pays close attention to issues such as the distribution of prison rations, the management of work, and hygiene. Of course, there are still many areas that need to be supplemented and improved, but in fact, it depends on whether the factors of economy and manpower make it possible to resolve these difficulties. Especially economic difficulties, which are the most difficult to resolve at present.</p>
<p>The Inmates' Diet</p>
<p>Turning the most undisciplined people into the most mechanical actions—this is the first chapter of prison life. Currently, they get up before 7:00 AM, have breakfast at 8:30 AM, and then begin work. They eat lunch between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM. Work stops around 4:00 PM. If they do night work, they have another meal, around 7:00 or 8:00 PM. Because the time of the visit happened to be during the inmates' "eating enjoyment," all one saw was them very systematically placing cans of rice and vegetable dishes into food carriers and sending them to their companions to eat. The rice was white rice, topped with broad beans and vegetables. Inmates who worked and were not being punished all received a nearly full can of lunch. Sick and female inmates also had porridge and soy milk to eat. Is this enough to maintain a person's necessary nutrition? One certainly cannot be dogmatic, but for the inmates themselves, it might not be something to be grateful for. Moreover, it is said that the prison authorities went to great lengths to maintain the practice of eating vegetables four times a month, that is, fish twice and meat twice.</p>
<p>Group Living</p>
<p>There are over two hundred female inmates in the women's ward, mostly convicted of smuggling, theft, kidnapping, and other crimes. Before mealtime, they are all busy working, knitting gloves, weaving, making shoes, and so on. Their wages are quite low, but in reality, female inmates who have work to do are much happier than their companions who sit idly in the corners of their cells, their faces filled with sorrow and grief. At least they gain the pleasure of living and working together, the pleasure of group living.</p>
<p>Regardless of male or female inmates, the cells they live in are square and wide, just enough to "accommodate" them, but they are kept quite clean. Female inmates have beds because they are weaker. Inmates sweep the floor at all times. In fact, because things are too simple, in other words, possessions have been reduced to the irreducible minimum. On the plank bed, there is only a blanket and a mat; in the corner of the room, a bucket; mud walls and iron windows—that is all. In terms of hygiene, the simpler things are, the easier it is to keep them clean; in terms of life philosophy, the fewer possessions one has, the fewer worries one has. This environment for inmates is truly the best "land of pleasure" for repentance and self-reflection.</p>
<p>Clothes and bedding are washed and changed once a week, using sophisticated washing machines instead of manual labor, ensuring cleanliness and speed. There are also inmates specifically assigned to mend torn clothes. Regarding work, we might as well discuss it in more detail.</p>
<p>Well-Equipped Workshops</p>
<p>Having inmates work is the most important thing in terms of prison management. First, production can be utilized; second, inmates can rely on it to survive after serving their sentences; third, it can reduce inmates' loneliness, laziness, and dependency, and moreover, it can foster their self-esteem. The workshop facilities in Shanghai Prison are quite complete. In terms of work, there are: printing, bookbinding, painting, metalwork, sewing, shoemaking, weaving straw mats, and so on. They accept orders from the outside world and undertake all kinds of work for the public sector. For example, things that we come into daily contact with, or at least things that are related to every citizen, such as household survey forms and receipts for donations to various public institutions, are mostly printed by inmates in this Shanghai Prison.</p>
<p>In the metal workshop, a large batch of rice buckets and food containers are being repaired. These items are made of lead sheet metal, and once they are damaged, they must be repaired by soldering. Because there are thousands of inmates, the number of food containers alone is countless. Apart from the printing workshop, which is the largest in scale, the size of the other workshops and the number of inmates doing work are determined by the needs of all parties and the simplicity of the work. Recently, there have been approximately nine hundred to a thousand inmates actually working. Everyone has work to do, everyone has food to eat—if it could be further improved, wouldn't it be even more ideal?</p>
<p>Walking into the printing workshop, the smell of ink, lead type, and a "metallic" odor assaults the nostrils. The sounds of small and large pedal presses, proofing presses, paper cutters, and other machinery continuously pierce the ears. Those who have made a living from "ink" seem to be reunited with old friends and cannot help but pay extra attention. The workshop is divided into two parts: the typesetting room and the printing room. The former is equipped like a medium-sized printing shop, while the latter can be rightly called a relatively large-scale printing factory. Just look at a blackboard hanging on the wall, on which is written "Printing Workshop Work Limit Schedule." There are a total of seventeen printing machines, including pedal presses, "British" machines, and paper cutters. The types of items being printed include household survey forms, fire report summaries, notepads, cooperative economic distribution lists, stationery, IOUs, business cards, and so on. Apart from invitations to weddings and funerals, it seems that the public sector has everything it needs. Stapling is also a specialized job, and several inmates are responsible for it.</p>
<p>Managing the workshop is not an easy task. Each section is assigned a foreman. Apart from a few skilled workers who are not criminals, the rest are inmates who are selected for their talents and taught various skills and techniques. What is most interesting is that in the sewing workshop, I saw two inmates making two very fashionable women's cheongsams: low-necked, short-sleeved, with narrow waists and light hems, and the styles are very novel. One of them is even made of silk. Of course, these are commissioned by people from outside, and this inmate used to hold scissors before.</p>
<p>The Incarceration Trilogy—Shaving, Bathing, Changing Clothes</p>
<p>In the reformatory, I saw several inmates reading books—the Old and New Testaments and various books of virtue—and some young inmates who had attended classes were studying on their own. Even more, a "new" inmate was having his head shaved—this is the first step in the incarceration trilogy, which is shaving, bathing, changing clothes and getting an ID number—very particular indeed. They use an electric "razor"—a young inmate uses a hand-cranked generator to generate electricity, and an "old" inmate moves the shaver very freely and casually over the inmate's head. It turns out that inmates can only have short, flat haircuts and are not allowed to have high or low shapes, let alone apply pomade or grease. Therefore, the complicated haircutting techniques that we consider important are treated as trivial here.</p>
<p>After being shaved, this new inmate goes to a very large bathroom to take a bath, and at the same time, the clothes he brought from another world outside, regardless of whether they are Western or Chinese, long or short, new or old, wool or cotton, are stripped off and replaced with a numbered prison uniform. Currently, they mostly wear white cloth shirts and trousers, with a gray-brown vest or short jacket on the outside. In the prison, these two colors, white and gray-brown, are seen everywhere. The inmates' clothes are, needless to say, white on the upper part of the walls and gray-brown on the lower part, and the mats and quilts are also in these colors. Even the tin food containers and the terrazzo floor, and the dangerous looks of the inmates, all carry this melancholy and somber color. This is probably what makes a prison a prison.</p>
<p>Finally, we visited the hospital and the office. One is the most painful and at the same time the most blessed place for people. The other is the headquarters that is able to manage a large institution like Shanghai Prison in such an orderly and methodical way.</p>
<p>To give inmates happiness and to retain useful people for the country and society, improving prison facilities is worthy of attention, but due to economic difficulties, many good plans cannot be implemented, especially sanitation work, which requires funds everywhere and cannot be started. At this time, when summer epidemics are prevalent, it is really impossible to ignore. It is deeply hoped that people in society can consider the future of public security and humanity and provide strong assistance.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to information received here from the Associated Press: The Trieste issue, the first to occur since the end of the war in Europe, suddenly took a serious turn yesterday. The U.S. authorities, due to the gradual deterioration of disputes in the Italian border area near Gorizia, have sent troops to forcibly stop the actions of the Yugoslav army in the area. It is reported that the American troops confiscated all the spoils of war taken by the Italian "patriots" from the east bank of the Isonzo River, and set up obstacles around the Gorizia area to stop or search Yugoslav troops and Italian "patriots" passing through the area.</p>

Detailed plans for revising the border between France and Italy will be proposed at the future peace conference, but formal negotiations between the two governments have not yet begun. The current request is only for a partial revision of the eastern border lines.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, a Reuters reporter discusses the plan for handling Germany as follows: Within the next two years, British authorities will give Germany the opportunity to restore sixty percent of its 1941 industrial capacity, but strict inspections must be carried out in Germany on a unit-by-square-mile basis. All underground industrial facilities, military production, aircraft factories, etc., that could enable Germany to gain war power in the future will be destroyed. In addition, the entire industrial area of Germany will be monitored to eliminate the possibility of secret military activities. This will be the greatest task of the future administrative authorities.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The World Peace Guarantee Organization Conference voted yesterday to decide that the organization of the World Security Council should include six non-permanent specialist countries in addition to the five permanent council countries. However, the selection of these six countries should be determined by the size of their contribution to maintaining international security and their possession of considerable land area. According to the vote, the amendments proposed by the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing were followed. At the meeting on Wednesday, the organization conference also voted to decide that France will also be a permanent member of the Council after its nation-building is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Opposition Between Two Camps on Trusteeship Issue <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from San Francisco: New Zealand Prime Minister and Chairman of the International Trusteeship Committee of the San Francisco Conference, Fraser, recently met with the press and issued a statement explaining the issue of international trusteeship in detail. The content roughly states that the opinions of various countries on this issue are quite disparate. So far, Australia, the Philippines, France, the Netherlands, China, South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union have all submitted their views to the Committee. The meeting has been held three times, and general discussions are nearing completion. However, major issues, such as whether the territory of the international trusteeship system should be divided into strategic, non-strategic, and welfare areas; whether security areas should be placed under the Security Council; whether strategic areas should be placed under the Security Council; and whether welfare areas should be placed under the Security Committee, remain unresolved. Fraser also described the work of the committee, stating that the committee's work was greatly hindered by the lack of provisions on the international trusteeship system in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. Currently, it is only based on the Yalta Agreement, which divides the territory of international trusteeship into old League of Nations mandates, territories seized from the enemy in this war, and colonies that are hoped to be incorporated into the international trusteeship system. Apart from relying on the Yalta Agreement, the committee has almost nothing to follow, and has only received many proposals from relevant countries.</p>
<p>Sub-Committee Draft Plan</p>
<p>The committee has established a sub-committee, chaired by Colonel Stauss, a representative of the U.S. delegation. It is currently drafting a plan based on the proposals of various countries. Fraser also stated that various countries only hope to adopt recommendations on international governance institutions, without discussing specific territorial issues, which has greatly hampered the work of the committee. He also stated that another difficulty for the committee is the current opposition between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, and the camp of colonial countries such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. According to past meetings, there are three points of conflict between the countries: Regarding the goals of international governance, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing oppose the independence of the people of the governed territories, believing that doing so would put their own economies at a disadvantage, create an invisible barrier, and give great disadvantages to their domestic industries and workers. Regarding the economic issues of the governed territories, the United States advocates protecting the industries of the colonial countries themselves, while the International Trusteeship Committee advocates investigating the actual conditions of the governed areas, but colonial countries have expressed their opposition.</p>
<p>U.S. Proposes Compromise Plan</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The issue of regional agreements advocated by Central and South American representatives has become a stumbling block to the future of the San Francisco Conference, and the conference has been stalled due to Soviet opposition. In order to break this deadlock, interim Chairman Stettinius convened a five-nation meeting on the night of the 15th, but the Soviet representative refused to attend on the grounds that he had not received instructions from Moscow. Therefore, it was in fact a four-nation meeting. At the meeting, the United States proposed a compromise New American Mutual Defense Treaty, which is said to have been recognized by the United Kingdom, France, and Chongqing. Stettinius further decided that the compromise plan should be discussed by the full meeting, and convened a five-nation meeting on the 17th. If the Soviet instructions still have not arrived by that time, it can be seen that the Soviet Union opposes the U.S. compromise plan.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Improving Prison Hygiene: Fundraising for Medical Funds, Minister Wu and Others Invite Various Sectors to Discuss Measures Yesterday <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Regarding improving the hygiene facilities for prison inmates, the late Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yunxia, had vigorously planned during his lifetime, but was unable to realize it due to limited funds. Minister Zhang unfortunately contracted an epidemic and died after inspecting a prison. Now, after Wu Songbi took over as Minister of Judicial Administration, he is even more determined to improve prison hygiene and strives for change. He has decided to carry on the late Minister's legacy and continue to work hard to improve the situation. Minister Wu then came to Shanghai a few days ago and decided to raise funds to improve the hygiene and medical fund for Shanghai prisons. Together with Li Sihao and Chen Binhe, he held a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 18th), inviting people from all walks of life to participate in the discussion. Minister Wu arrived at the meeting on time with his subordinates. Prominent figures from all walks of life attended enthusiastically, and everyone spontaneously pledged donations on the spot, showing great enthusiasm. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>From various judicial organs: Cai Rixin, Wu Xuanren, Hu Hua, Shen Wenjie, Zhao Zheng; from the municipal government: Li Shiyu, Yuan Junchang, Zhou Yuying; from various sectors: Wen Guanting, Shi Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Shaoyan, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Boyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Zhang Deqin, Wu Yong'an, Shao Shuhua, Shen Ruizhou, Xu Busun, Yang Fusheng, Wang Haibo, Shi Lüqing, Wang Shuxian, Shen Weiting, Bao Guochang, Yang Heqing, Zhang Baocun, and over sixty others.</p>
<p>Tea Party Proceedings</p>
<p>First, Minister Wu delivered a speech, explaining the importance of improving prison hygiene facilities and fulfilling the legacy of the late Minister Zhang. Then, Li Sihao delivered a speech, hoping that all sectors of the city would actively pledge donations. Next, Li Shiyu, the third section chief of the police bureau, reported on recent criminal cases in the city and the criminal motives of the criminals in each case, most of which were caused by the pressure of life.

<p>Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency, has arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday, because the internal adjustment has been basically completed after the Central News Agency was reorganized as a public interest corporate entity.

<h3 id="e36">Future Work Direction of the Municipal Propaganda Office: Remarks by Director Gu at the Regular Press Conference <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since Director Gu of the Municipal Propaganda Office took office, the work and policy guidelines for propaganda have been set. Yesterday (the 18th) at 10:30 AM, the 17th regular press conference was held in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government. Director Gu announced the key points of the future plan to promote propaganda work as follows:</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the efficiency of wartime cultural propaganda and to communicate the feelings of various authors, it is planned to hold regular symposiums of cultural figures recently, so as to unify the direction of wartime cultural propaganda.</p>
<p>Strengthen the guidance of newspapers and magazines, regularly provide propaganda materials, and instruct propaganda guidelines. If there are any records or opinions that violate national policy, they will be corrected or banned at any time.</p>
<p>Unify drama censorship. All Peking operas, spoken dramas, operas, Yue operas, vaudeville, etc. performed in various theaters in the city must submit the script to the office for review before the performance. If necessary, a rehearsal will be ordered before deciding whether to allow the performance or not. Recently, dramas performed by foreigners have also been reviewed by the office according to the same rules.</p>
<p>Holding a city-wide box office registration is also related to the unified review of drama work. There are dozens of registered box offices in the city, but some are still intending to wait and see. The office will set a deadline, and those who are overdue will be banned.</p>
<p>Various coffee shops, restaurants, and dance halls in the city are found to have various singing, music, and dance performances. The content of many of them is not in line with wartime life. This kind of vulgar custom has an impact on wartime propaganda. In order to unify the review and rectification, the office has drafted the "Shanghai Special City Music, Singing, and Dance Review Rules" and submitted it to the former municipal government for approval. Once approved, the management and review of this item will be implemented.</p>
<p>The propaganda work of the counties and districts under its jurisdiction is also being assisted in formulating measures to promote and assess, etc. Other work is also proceeding as usual. Finally, Director Gu also talked about the fact that the newspapers in the city have made significant progress since the establishment of the Federation and the renovation of the content. However, there are still occasional traces of superficial words in one or two chapters. I hope that more attention will be paid to the selection of manuscripts in the future in order to achieve the mission of wartime reporting.</p>

In view of the high price increase this year, the tax revenue ratio should be increased. It is planned that the collection ratio will be adjusted again in each district from the second half of the year.</p>

<p>The Silk Industry Association of the Business Coordination Committee, based on the total amount of loan funds accumulated by the same industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to apply for the purchase of spring cocoons in the 34th year, has been in contact with the banking industry to negotiate loans. Yesterday afternoon, at 3:00 PM, they held a meeting with the leaders of the silver group at the Duchen Hotel on Jiangxi Road to exchange opinions on loan details, interest, and other matters. The situation was good. It is reported that the loan has been increased to 600 million yuan in accordance with the price increase of spring cocoons, and the silver group has recognized it. The interest rate is 1.6%, and the term is nine months, with one-third of the loan being repaid every three months. The loan silver groups are China Bank, Bank of Communications, Huaxing Bank, Guohua Bank, China Industry Bank, and 17 other banks. The loan method is handled by discounting bills. There are 37 silk industry manufacturers that borrow money, including Dali, Dingchang, and Longchang. The date of signing the borrowing contract is around the 20th of this month. The goal of purchasing spring cocoons is calculated at 105,000 yuan per load of fresh cocoons. It is estimated that 105,000 loads can be purchased, and the total amount required will be 600 million yuan. The loan amount is 5 times more than last year's 50 million yuan. Therefore, the Higher Court and the District Court of this city have been selected as legal appraisers to handle the matter carefully. All real estate cases are handled by the Association. Recently, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank sent a letter to the Association, stating that it would accept the Association's evaluation list in the future.

If the local post office has insufficient funds to turn around, all remittances may be paid later, and the remitter shall not have any objections. It is also reported that the bureau is still taking care of the telegraphic transfers to various places, but the telegraphic transfer fees have been adjusted separately.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Everyone Has a Heart of Compassion: Master Si Yong Pavilion Donates a Large Sum of Money Alone <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Our office has been collecting donations for the fire relief in Yuyao Road. For three days, all sectors have been enthusiastically donating, which can be said to be in full swing. It can be seen that everyone has a heart of compassion. Yesterday, we received a letter from the master of Si Yong Pavilion, who donated 2 million yuan alone, setting a new record. He also suggested that these disaster victims are not only starving, but also have no house to shelter them from the wind and rain. They will be exposed to the sun and sleep in the open air for a long time, and they will become hungry. Can the original site of the Caohuo Jing drifter habit movement be used as a temporary resettlement place for the victims? In terms of relief, the issue of accommodation can be resolved first. If things are implemented, the only difficulty is food, but there are many rich and kind people in Shanghai, and it is not difficult to raise tens of millions of dollars in education funds. As for the donations received from all walks of life, I hope that they will be used to purchase food as soon as possible, and do not delay for a long time, so that the disaster victims will suffer more pain. According to the master of Si Yong Pavilion, he is currently recuperating in Suzhou, and was deeply sympathetic after seeing the tragic situation of the war and fire reported in the newspaper. He wrote a letter from afar, not only donating a large sum of money, but also earnestly providing valuable advice. Regarding the borrowing of the drifter habit movement, this office will discuss with the Restoration Committee. As for the donations received, we will put them into use as soon as possible, which is the same as our office's opinion. A few days ago, we discussed with Mr. Le Fenglin of the Restoration Committee, and Mr. Le also felt the same. However, the manufacturers in the Xuhui District are currently donating food to maintain the diet of the victims. In order to improve the method of delivering food, the Huashan Police Precinct has printed temporary disaster victim population certificates, and the Baojia chiefs are assisting in providing food with the certificates. For the donations from all walks of life, it is planned to construct simple houses for the victims in a short period of time to truly solve the problem of housing. In short, we will always take into account the principles of speed and properness when using the donations, and consult with the responsible personnel of the Restoration Committee at any time, so as to live up to the enthusiasm and expectations of the donors. We still hope that all sectors will continue to donate, so that we can thoroughly solve the disaster for our compatriots, which is very fortunate. Our office will collect donations for one week, from the 16th to the 22nd.</p>

<p>The Second Division League, Sections B6 and B3, held decisive matches for the top spot. Yesterday at 4:30 PM, the matches took place at the Sichuan Road YMCA gymnasium. First was the Section B6 match between Xinxie and the Blue Team. During halftime, Xinxie was trailing by five points, with a score of 14 to 9. In the second half, Xinxie's Qu Yongfu and Huang Fengzhu worked hard to counterattack, coming back from 19 to 14. However, when the score was 23 to 27, Xinxie's main player Huang Fengzhu was disqualified due to his fourth foul, significantly weakening their strength. The Blue Team seized the opportunity to counterattack and reverse the loss, defeating Xinxie with a score of 26 to 23. The second match was between Zhongxing and Flying Horse, competing for the top spot in Section B3. At halftime, Flying Horse led with four points, while Zhongxing had only two. After the break, with only 45 seconds left in the match and the score at 17 to 11, Zhongxing's Jing Xiwei, Jiang Xuexin, and Tong Pingxuan recklessly threw the ball at the referee. Chen Songliang deemed this an insult to the referee and declared Zhongxing the loser.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Lessons from the Huxi Fire <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>The extent of the losses suffered by the shantytown residents in the recent Huxi fire was briefly reported in this newspaper the other day. The losses suffered by the residents inside the alleyways were also significant. These alleyway houses, including Jun'an Fang and Longxing Fang, totaled 290 households. Among them, at least 200 families were poor, totaling 1,900 people. Most of them worked in nearby factories. About 40 families were in the bean sprout business, while others were unemployed workers, now running stalls and selling rice to make a living. Their origins were Ning Shao, Subei, and local, making them more diverse than the shantytown residents. Their clothing was naturally more abundant than that of the shantytown residents, so their losses were naturally greater.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Longxing Fang. This alleyway had 42 house numbers. The construction of the houses was relatively solid. However, in order to accommodate more families in each house, the landlords built mezzanines out of wooden boards on each floor. A living room was also divided into three or four rooms with wooden boards. On the balconies, four-story buildings were built with plywood and foreign pine boards. The original brick and tile houses were transformed into mostly wooden structures.</p>
<p>The alleyway used a deep well for its water supply, with electricity used for pumping. The well was located at No. 21 in the alley. Since the first power restriction last January, the residents' daily water supply was stopped. However, in reality, the water was not truly cut off but was supplied by the landlord to the tiger stove (a public cooking stove) and bean sprout businesses on the black market. It is said that the black market water sold to the tiger stove (with a special pipe for access) cost 150,000 yuan per month, while the black market water sold to the bean sprout businesses ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 yuan per month, totaling 500,000 yuan. After the fire broke out, the well was locked inside the house and could not be used, so the fire trucks could not get water when they arrived.</p>
<p>Some people also said that a certain house number in this alleyway was hoarding a large amount of kerosene, soap, wooden cores (a raw material for making spools), paint, and coking coal (with a calorific value of 3,000 degrees, used exclusively for melting furnaces in foundries). These items were all highly flammable and heat-resistant. The fire was so intense that when the reporter went to inspect the site on the afternoon of the fourth day, smoke was still coming out of the brick seams of the collapsed walls, indicating that they were still burning inside.</p>
<p>The congestion of residents, the perpetual lack of resources, and the hoarding of dangerous goods were the main reasons why the Yuyao Road fire spread so widely. Every corner of Shanghai has alleyways like Longxing Fang. In today's era of indiscriminate enemy bombing, the danger is unimaginable if something happens. Therefore, the voluntary evacuation of citizens in this city is a matter of utmost urgency. Everyone should remember the tragic lessons of this great disaster.</p>
<p>Walls of constant ruins, destroyed furniture and instruments, and piles of burnt brick and cement floors... Most noticeable were dozens of broken large jars, which were used for bean sprout production. Some of the remaining tattered shacks were less damaged. They cleared the broken bricks and tiles and used straw to build a temporary bed. They were homeless and had to guard these ruins, hoping to rebuild a new home on the ruins.</p>
<p>Life after the disaster was extremely miserable. Take the workers, for example. They were mostly workers from factories such as Sanpin, Wanzan, and Jiuchang. The factories had been burned down, so where could they find work? Some factories issued relief funds of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, but sitting and eating would not solve the problem. Thus, they had to run around looking for relatives and friends, raising money, or seeking new ways out. They had almost completely become unemployed.</p>
<p>The disaster victims in these alleyways are now also relying on the porridge and rice distributed to survive. Their lives are even harder than those of the shantytown residents who worked as laborers, because they cannot sell their labor empty-handed.</p>
<p>Since this newspaper began collecting donations for the Yuyao Road fire, people from all walks of life have responded enthusiastically with unparalleled zeal. Within three days, the amount of donations received has reached more than 10 million yuan. This figure is enough to illustrate the greatness of the spirit of mutual assistance among the residents of this city.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Special Attack Team Before Launch in Shen Bao Weekly <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Last Meal</p>
<p>Three seaweed rice balls wrapped in nori, plus three pickled radishes - this was the "bento" for the Zhenwu Special Attack Team's last meal. The rice was made of pearly white grains. When split open, the center was a truly fine preserved plum, red and adorable. The warriors ate this last meal on the plane before setting off to fight the enemy. Rice, seaweed, preserved plum, and pickled radish, though not precious treasures, deeply expressed the heart of the motherland. Using these rice balls as the final bento for special attack team members carrying the destiny of the motherland as they plunged into the sea off Okinawa was truly appropriate.</p>
<p>The special attack team members were wearing full flight suits, the area above their knees bulging like lanterns, wolfing down their rations. This scene truly moved the reporter deeply. Three days had passed since the second special attack general offensive began, and today a large number of Zhenwu Special Attack Teams were also departing from this base.</p>
<p>Using spiritual strength to shatter the enemy's material strength is a unique Japanese tactic. The effects of this general offensive will become apparent on the surface of the battlefield. The special attack spirit runs through three thousand years of Japanese history and is deeply rooted in the hearts of the nation. In this autumn of national crisis, using one's life to salvage the glory of the motherland is not at all unreasonable. Only this can express the unique Japanese special attack spirit. Because this is the prosperity of the nation's history and life, special attack team members have long disregarded life and death in order to protect the motherland and defend justice. Even their parents and the entire nation do not feel anything unnatural about this honorable act of sacrificing one's life for righteousness.</p>
<p>Words of Farewell</p>
<p>Zhongyuan, the platoon leader of the 00th Zhenwu Team (a graduate of the Army Officer School), was the eldest of seven brothers. The night before his departure, he told the reporter, "Right now, I'm not thinking about anything, and I feel like I'm returning to childhood!" Valley Glory Junior Lieutenant (a graduate of Nihon University) and others in the same team also expressed that this statement "deeply resonated with their hearts." They all said in unison:</p>
<p>"The feelings right now are indescribable. Special attack is not just for us; everyone will become a special attack team!"</p>
<p>Awatsu, the lieutenant who departed on the first day of the second general offensive (a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University), left behind the following words:</p>
<p>"Our stepping out from behind this curtain has been natural from the very beginning."</p>
<p>Indeed, for every Japanese person, completing the mission entrusted by the nation means living in the history and life of the motherland. This principle is difficult to explain in words, just like the feeling of gratitude for the rations - it can only be understood implicitly and cannot be conveyed verbally. Therefore, the only way to make the enemy understand this special attack spirit is to completely destroy the enemy's material strength on the battlefield. After the enemy troops tasted the Japanese special attack tactics in the Philippines, they began to cry out in misery. In the decisive battle of Okinawa, their terror of the Japanese special attacks was even more pronounced. As an example, in order to defend against Japanese special attack team attacks, they used Grumman aircraft to conduct intensive patrols, setting up the area near Tanegashima as the first line, Amami Oshima as the second line, and the perimeter of Okinawa Island as the third line. Around their mobile units, they constantly deployed half of their entire air force to serve as escorts and guards. The enemy is currently using most of its forces to defend against Japanese special attack attacks, but they still inevitably suffer heavy losses. To this day, the enemy no longer dares to say that the Japanese special attack tactics are suicide tactics.</p>
<p>Sure-Kill Tactics</p>
<p>Ouchi, the team leader of the 0th Subduing Demon Team, on the day before his departure, strongly argued with the operations staff at the base about the amount of bombs loaded onto the special attack aircraft. The staff said that only 0 kilograms could be loaded, but he insisted that it could be doubled, to 00 kilograms. The staff argued that the special attack aircraft had auxiliary fuel tanks, and if the 00 kilograms of bombs that Ouchi proposed were loaded, it would be difficult to take off.</p>
<p>"In that case, let me experiment myself."</p>
<p>So he immediately requested permission from his superiors to conduct a daring test flight in front of the staff and the entire team. The result was a success. The special attack aircraft, carrying 00 kilograms of bombs, actually took off safely. If this experiment had failed, Ouchi, who was going to lead his subordinates to attack enemy ships the next day, might have lost his precious life. Why did Ouchi risk this dangerous experiment to increase the bomb load? Was it because he had given up his life after being selected as a special attack team member? No. First, Ouchi believed that no matter how heavy it was, as long as it could fly, then there would be no problem afterward, because the departure of a special attack aircraft was always one-way, with no intention of returning. The state of mind of the special attack team members, preparing for death, was fully revealed here. Second, he believed that the more bombs, the better, because this would make the battle results more certain when engaging in a desperate fight.</p>
<p>Completing the Mission</p>
<p>However, although the special attack team members were determined to die, the primary element was still completing the assigned mission. Therefore, it was not enough to just crash into something; it was essential to inflict a decisive blow on the enemy. This is the true essence of the special attack spirit.</p>
<p>On the night before departure, a solemn and tragic send-off meeting was held at the base. Everyone drank cold sake and prayed solemnly. Sergeant Kazama (born as a boy soldier), who had drunk a few cups of cold sake, said generously and gratefully, "Our team leader is so great!" He expressed his great gratitude for Ouchi's successful experiment. His expression is still vivid in my mind and will never be forgotten. In fact, the entire team of the special attack team was extremely happy about the success of increasing the bomb load.</p>
<p>At the base, some people called airplanes "heavenly machines." At least today, the Japanese special attack tactics are fully demonstrating their power through airplanes. The Japanese special attack spirit can only fully develop its essence when it has airplanes. Using the spirit of sacrifice passed down from generation to generation since the founding of the country as the warp and the most modern attack weapon, the airplane, as the weft, the greatest and most magnificent scene is woven. At this critical moment of national rise and fall, it would be too plain if there were no special attack teams competing with ten thousand cherry blossoms in bloom to embellish it.

<h3 id="e58">The Last Telegram <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>At the foot of a tall hill, a horizontal cave opened up. This cave was where the air defense communications office was located. The night was deep, and Captain Ichihashi and the communications soldiers under his command were wholeheartedly trying to pick up the final telegram sent by the special attack aircraft. They were constantly turning the dial of the receiver. Several aircraft of the Zhenwu Special Attack Team, with Sergeant Watanabe's aircraft as the leader, had departed together at a certain hour and minute on the 27th, under the pale light of the full moon. It had been 0 hours now. "They must have reached the airspace over their targets by now?" Although it was a foreign country, it was bone-chillingly cold at night. Would these divine eagles who departed from the base in the deep night succeed? No one in the cave was without deep anxiety, and no one was without sincere hope. The communications soldiers were wearing headphones, concentrating and holding their breath, not moving their bodies.</p>
<p>Captain Ichihashi looked at the time and suddenly said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Today's dawn attack by special attack aircraft is a first for this base. From here to Okinawa Island, it is more than 600 kilometers, and they must skillfully avoid enemy night patrol aircraft and annoying night fighters. This is really difficult for army pilots who are not used to flying over the ocean!"</p>
<p>However, although Sergeant Watanabe only took a small number of aircraft, the team members were all born as boy soldiers, and all had more than 1,300 hours of flight experience. Their skills were very skilled, and they were full of confidence.</p>
<p>"Here it comes!" Suddenly, a communications soldier broke the silence in the cave and shouted. The clock's pointer was exactly at 0:00. Squeak... Squeak... Squeak! Once the insect-like radio waves finished flowing, the information sent by the special attack aircraft could be heard clearly.</p>
<p>"We have broken through!" This was the last telegram sent by Corporal Takeda of the fourth aircraft.</p>
<p>At this time, they must have been facing the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire, bravely holding the guaranteed-hit giant bomb and rushing toward the enemy ship, determined to perish together.</p>
<p>Corporal Takeda's telegram ended just like that. He was a 23-year-old young man. Before his departure, he wrote these words in the reporter's autograph book: "We sincerely pray for the eternal glory of the motherland, and we are departing with the determination to hit the target."</p>
<p>Before the scheduled time of departure, the team members were either concentrating on investigating weather charts or studying the route to the airspace above the target. Their attitudes were so calm and relaxed, as if they were test flying, without any excitement. Only this pure spirit of loyalty, transcending all interests and desires, solely aiming to protect the motherland and dedicating oneself entirely, could enable the young team members to reach the enlightened state of life and death as one, like an ancient monk. When the reporter thought that the young warriors who had been chatting and laughing freely a few hours ago were now in a different world, he felt the harsh reality of war even more deeply.</p>
<p>Captain Ichihashi and the communications soldiers under his command were also quietly reminiscing about the young warriors who had ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>Silence once again dominated the cave. After about twenty minutes, the receiver received the final report from Sergeant Hashimoto of the second aircraft. That tragic, spiritual cry, through the weak radio waves, reached here.</p>
<p>"Do it! Do it!" A communications soldier shouted involuntarily.</p>
<p>Sergeant Hashimoto could be said to be the incarnation of fighting spirit, full of energy. When he departed on the 22nd, he took off from this base with Captain Kataoka, but had to turn back halfway due to engine trouble. "What a pity, I was one step behind the team leader and comrades, I have nothing to say!" He always said that since that day. Today, he departed for the second time. He sang his self-composed lyrics "Man and machine advance together, must-die-attack, non-stop non-promise aircraft carrier sunk," bravely crashing into the enemy ship, transforming into a ghost to protect the country, fulfilling his lifelong wish.</p>
<p>The headphones were almost pressing on the communications soldiers' ears, but they were still focusing all their attention on waiting for the telegram from the special attack aircraft. However, the aircraft of Sergeant Watanabe and the two corporals who had departed from the base together never made contact.</p>
<p>On this day, the special attack aircraft piloted by Corporals Takeda and Hashimoto sank an enemy aircraft carrier and a destroyer-like enemy ship near Okinawa Island. (Oyamada Reporting Team Member, translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, May 2)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Construction Administration in the Past Two Months <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jidun</p>
<p>The implementation of a wartime system requires nothing more than simplifying administration. The principles of administrative simplification are none other than economizing on manpower and material resources. In the past, the city's Public Utilities Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and branch offices overlapped. Although the institutions were different, their uses were actually similar. For example, repairing roads and dredging rivers and canals are matters for the Public Works Bureau, but they involve public utilities; laying road tracks and installing electrical wires are matters for the Public Utilities Bureau, but they involve public works. In essence, they all fall within the scope of construction. Therefore, it is difficult to separate tasks, and authority is easily confused. Duplication and conflict are unavoidable. Not only are manpower and material resources uneconomical, but they also restrain each other and hinder progress. This is why the city's Public Works Bureau and Public Utilities Bureau were merged into the Construction Bureau.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Construction Bureau, I, Jidun, though not talented, have taken on the important task of Director. Where I have been appointed, I am aware that Shanghai's important status and large population mean that the need for construction projects such as public works and public utilities is more urgent than elsewhere. For example, water and electricity supply, factory machinery, land and water transportation, road administration, flood control, construction, gardens, and inspection services are all closely related to the lives of residents. If various construction policies can be smoothly promoted, the citizens will surely benefit from them. Otherwise, the harm caused would be unimaginable. However, construction is not an easy task, especially now that the war is raging and materials and funds are extremely scarce, and motorized tools are particularly difficult to obtain. I, Jidun, respectfully adhere to the principle of "treating the symptoms in times of urgency," first focusing on current needs without exaggeration, seeking truth from facts, and doing everything possible to accomplish what we can. I hereby present a brief account of the various facilities implemented in the past two months, hoping that the esteemed figures of Shanghai will provide guidance.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Bureau's Offices: The Bureau's offices were established during the time of the former Public Works Bureau and are distributed in the four districts of Northern Shanghai, Southern Shanghai, the city center, and Pudong. At that time, the work of the offices was specialized in public works. This time, the Bureau, in line with the principle of administrative simplification, has merged the Northern Shanghai Vehicle Registration Office and the Northern Shanghai Ship Registration Office, which were established by the Public Utilities Bureau, into the Northern Shanghai Office; the Southern Shanghai Vehicle Registration Office and the Southern Shanghai Ship Registration Office into the Southern Shanghai Office; and the Pudong Vehicle Registration Office into the Pudong Office. The Xuhui Vehicle Registration Office was expanded into an office that also handles public works. The scope of jurisdiction of each district has been clearly defined and has been implemented since April 1st.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Pier Management Offices: The Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in the city are connected from north to south. The shoreline is long, and there are many piers. In the past, only one management office was set up to be in charge of the management of the piers, which was difficult to be effective. After the establishment of the Bureau, based on the actual needs, the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek area was divided into six sections: Southern Shanghai, the Bund, Eastern Suzhou, Central Suzhou, and Western Suzhou. A pier management office was set up in each section to facilitate nearby management. Since then, pier affairs have gradually become more organized, and efforts are being made to rectify them.</p>
<p>Electricity and Water Supply: Water and electricity are essential for the daily lives of citizens. If management is not thorough, it will have a major impact on social safety and the health of citizens. From the moment I took office, I strictly enforced the registration of electrical material merchants and contractors, as well as the inspection and acceptance of new electrical and water supply projects. I also sent personnel to inform citizens about safety management at all times. Recently, due to the reduction in water supply and the need for air defense, citizens have been digging earth wells and air defense wells. In order to guide and assist them, and to facilitate supervision and management, the Bureau has also formulated registration methods and announced their implementation. Street lights are closely related to nighttime traffic, air defense, and crime prevention. Since the Bureau took over the street lights in the old district, it has gradually rectified them and paid attention to repairs and maintenance. In order to assist in air defense, it has tried to reduce the light and the number of unnecessary street lights, which can also save electricity. In addition, the methods for citizens to report street light damage have been effective since their implementation.</p>
<p>Managing Mechanical Factory Operations: Since the city's electricity supply has been reduced repeatedly, many factories and public places have installed engines to solve the problem of power. Whether the installation is qualified has a significant impact on public safety. In order to ensure industrial safety and improve production efficiency, the Bureau believes that it is necessary to strengthen supervision. It has formulated supervisory rules and submitted them to the municipal government for official promulgation and implementation. It also stipulates that factories employing more than ten workers or using power must register with the Economic Bureau and have their internal equipment inspected by the Bureau. They may only use it after inspection and issuance of a permit. In addition, the investigation of industrial disasters and the improvement of factory equipment are also actively planned and implemented.</p>
<p>In the era of the former Public Works Bureau, training classes for mechanical technicians and boiler firemen were held with remarkable results. The Bureau is currently planning to resume them. As soon as preparations are complete, enrollment will be announced. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Schools Should Not Have Summer Vacations <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Shi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Jiang's article "On Early Completion of Classes" in the Municipal Weekly, I feel it is very correct. In the current turbulent situation, studying for one day means gaining one day's worth of knowledge. If the situation changes suddenly, one will lose the opportunity to study. If we end classes early now and implement a three-semester system, continuing classes during the summer vacation, then the precious two months will not be wasted. Holding classes during the summer vacation is a worthwhile method to promote at present.</p>
<p>Some people may say, isn't it the same to study in cram schools or review lessons at home during the summer vacation? However, I have already experienced this. Reviewing lessons on one's own or attending cram schools is never as focused as attending regular classes, and the benefits are also less. Moreover, studying is so difficult now. If a three-semester system is implemented, one can graduate from middle school in four years instead of the original six years. Under the wartime system, everything should be swift and economical, especially the economy of time, which should be paid more attention to. The faster students are trained, the more talents there will be in society. Moreover, after the war, talents will be needed for construction. Therefore, even for the sake of the country, the students, and the teachers, it is beneficial and harmless.</p>
<p>We students have a very urgent desire to serve society. In my capacity as a student, I earnestly request that the education authorities be able to understand the students' studies and the teachers' lives today, and to consider and study the method of continuing classes during the summer vacation.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Establishing Free Middle and Higher Schools <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>The establishment of compulsory education in our country has a considerable history; however, it is mostly elementary schools, and there are also some free places in middle schools or universities. The purpose of establishing elementary schools is to eradicate illiteracy, but the establishment of free places in middle schools, especially universities, only has a rewarding effect; therefore, it does not greatly benefit young students who are ambitious to study but have poor families. When people talk about the education problem in our country, they all think that compulsory public schools should be widely established to eliminate illiteracy; however, on the other hand, the lack of specialized talents in higher education in our country cannot be ignored. Because our country, especially in the peace zone, will need a large number of specialized talents who have received middle and higher education in politics, economics, and construction to be the backbone of revitalizing the family and building the peace zone; so as to chase and compete with the world's powers.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the tuition fees of university education in our country, except for a few national colleges that charge lower fees, have made universities the exclusive domain of a few wealthy classes. Most of the young people who are truly willing to work hard are from poor families. They are unable to continue to afford it and have no choice but to go into society to make a living. Furthermore, although national colleges charge relatively low fees, they are still not suitable for young people who have to work while studying because of the daytime courses. Therefore, the author proposes that, in order to promote the level of national knowledge, or attached to various schools, this type of free autumn school should be national, provincial, or public. If the regular expenses are not enough, they should be subsidized by social groups and individuals; the subjects should be science-based, and the curriculum should be credit-based, divided into compulsory and elective subjects; classes should be held after 4 pm and before 9 am to suit the spare time of out-of-school youths; the number of elective credits should be specified for each semester, and graduation should be granted upon completion.</p>
<p>As for the professors hired by each college, they should emphasize practicality and not rely on false reputations; because there are some professors who have false reputations such as doctoral degrees, but their knowledge is not as refined and practical as scholars who have specialized research on a certain subject. If the environment permits, a famous scholar or expert from outside the school should be specially invited to give a public academic lecture for one hour every week; at the same time, a library should be added for students to consult outside, so that students can get twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>After the establishment of this kind of free middle and higher schools, not only can it enable ambitious out-of-school youths to have a place to continue their studies in their spare time, but also enable older people to have the opportunity to learn some new scientific knowledge. In this way, it can truly achieve the effect of changing customs and habits, and make the entire society and country have a new atmosphere and embark on the road of revitalizing China.</p>
<h3 id="e62">After Reading "Baojia and Public Security" <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Binhe's article "Baojia and Public Security" (see the Shanghai Shenbao's replacement discussion on May 13), I have some thoughts; as Mr. Chen said: "Shanghai's situation will inevitably become more tense in the future" and "the flames of war may approach Shanghai." In this increasingly tense situation, how to strengthen the "basic organization of people's self-help, self-governance, and self-defense - Baojia work" is the top priority.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Baojia work has achieved remarkable results under the painstaking efforts of the authorities and the vigorous assistance of enthusiastic people (such as the establishment of organizational scale and service in various aspects), but it is also obvious that "the Baojia organization has not fully exerted its role in assisting public security."</p>
<p>I believe that in order to make Baojia healthy and consolidate public security, in addition to Mr. Chen's proposal to follow the principle of "those with money contribute money," the city's citizens must also "contribute their strength" to actively respond to various tasks, and especially the city's outstanding citizens must participate in various services, so that Baojia and the citizens are integrated, and they can assist in maintaining public security. Among them, it is especially hoped that the authorities can absorb as many outstanding youths from various regions as possible to participate in various Baojia services, because young people are full of vigor, vitality, and enthusiasm and purity. If they are allowed to assist their local Baojia work nearby, it will not only benefit the work, but also train the talents of the youth, which is beneficial to both. For example, the current "model team" and "special self-defense country" organizations of each Baojia have a small number of participants and are small in scale. In order to meet the needs of the future situation, the young and strong men in each Baojia area should be universally organized and given short-term training.</p>
<p>Also, the organization of "fire brigades" and "first aid teams" should be expanded urgently. This work has achieved some success, such as the Huangpu Branch's active training of professional youths, which can be a model for other districts. In order to adapt to the frequent air raids in the future, each Baojia district, as well as various groups, and institutions and schools, should immediately follow the example to carry out this training.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Summer Hygiene Issues <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— (Duanmu Qing)</p>
<p>Summer has arrived. In this densely populated Shanghai, I would like to mention a few points on hygiene issues for reference.</p>
<p>Strengthen Cleaning Work: It has recently started to rise, and in some places, the authorities always pay attention to finding ways to clean it up.</p>
<p>Review Food Hygiene: Meat, milk, and eggs contain more bacteria in summer. If you are not careful to check it, it is easy to cause illness. Those who review must absolutely break away from affection and strictly carry out inspections.</p>
<p>Eliminate Mosquitoes and Flies: Mosquitoes and flies have a strong breeding ability. In this early summer, we should take precautions and work with the Baojia institutions to launch a mosquito and fly extermination campaign. Eliminate dirty stagnant water (such as those accumulated on the roadside and in air-raid shelters).</p>
<p>Strive for Epidemic Prevention: Cholera, diphtheria, and other epidemic prevention injections have already begun, but there are still a large number of people who have not been injected. It is urgent to conduct spot checks on epidemic prevention certificates on the main roads and stations in the urban area in order to promote epidemic prevention injections.</p>
<p>Promote Health Education: The people of our country lack hygiene knowledge. The Health Bureau can send experienced propagandists to broadcast all the necessary common sense of summer hygiene on the streets or on the radio. The Chinese film authorities also have a film made that is both educational and meaningful, in order to instill hygiene knowledge in the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Opinions on Evacuation <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Guiyuan</p>
<p>As this war is entering a decisive stage, the daily necessities of citizens are blocked due to the source; prices are soaring, and even make people feel unable to breathe. If this continues to evolve, it will be unimaginable. The municipal authorities are aware of this; they have set up an "Evacuation Committee" to handle evacuation matters, which can be said to be the top priority. However, the author believes that there are still a few points that are hoped for by the Evacuation Committee:</p>
<p>The Evacuation Committee has designated: "All citizens who want to leave Shanghai can register with their respective hometown associations..." This article is naturally not a problem for those who have hometown associations and participate in the hometown association organization; but I believe that it depends on whether there are hometown associations and those who have never participated in the hometown association organization. For this type of citizen, my opinion is that they should apply directly to the Evacuation Committee, without having to organize hometown associations or join the hometown association.</p>
<p>Regarding car and boat tickets, the Evacuation Committee should liaise with the station, shipping company authorities, and various travel agencies. Those holding "Evacuation Travel Permits" must queue separately to purchase tickets in order; and must not deliberately delay or make things difficult.</p>
<p>In addition to the photo or fingerprint of the person, the "Citizen Evacuation Travel Permit" should also have a column for carrying items, recording the number and nature of the luggage carried, for the military and police along the way to check at any time, whether it is consistent with what is stated. If there is any profit-seeking or forbidden item, it should be immediately detained and dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>Solve the transportation tools for evacuated citizens: ships are not a problem, please ask the Evacuation Committee to forward to China Railway to ask whether it can attach a 40-ton iron fence car to the ordinary train to carry the evacuated citizens.</p>
<p>In addition to applying for a "Citizen Evacuation Travel Permit", the household registration transfer certificate should also be handled at the joint insurance office in the area where they live. The certificate should also detail the items carried; so that it can be mutually verified with the "Citizen Evacuation Travel Permit" issued by the Evacuation Committee.</p>
<p>The Evacuation Committee should order those who intend to return to their hometown but are unable to do so to provide a Baojia certificate; and within the possible scope, they should seek a guarantor to testify, so as to assist them according to the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Relax Restrictions on Tap Water <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Zuoqi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shenbao published a short comment on May 13th, "Restrictions on Tap Water Should Be Relaxed", calling on the tap water company to establish a more reasonable restriction standard according to the minimum needs of public life. This is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>The amount of water must be increased to be reasonable for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Due to the longer days and shorter nights, the power supply needs are less, and the water demand not only cannot be reduced, but also increases due to the hot weather.</p>
<p>There are substitutes for electricity, and the substitute for water—well water—contains many bacteria and is not suitable for consumption. If the amount of water is insufficient, it will inevitably have to be used, which will hinder the "epidemic prevention" of the health authorities.</p>
<p>If you have to exceed the water limit, it is difficult to bear the huge fine. The residents once called on the newspaper, "They live in a lane with a total of seventeen households. Recently, they used water according to the minimum demand, and were fined more than 5 million, about several thousand yuan per person, which is really unbearable." This is the effect of the low limit.</p>
<p>There are many disputes between the landlord and the second and third tenants due to fines.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that the relevant authorities can understand the people and relax the restrictions on tap water.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Correction <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>In the article "The Problem of Civil Servants' Treatment" published in this issue on May 12, there was a point that the treatment of the municipal government and the Finance Bureau's staff was particularly preferential. According to the investigation, the treatment of the municipal government's agencies has always been the same, and there is no difference. We hereby correct this. Editor.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Under Mother's Knee, Morning and Evening <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yisong</p>
<p>Eight years! A few nights before my eldest brother's wedding, in the living room when Mother wasn't home, Father said these words to my eldest brother: "You cannot choose your own mother, but this time, I hope you choose the mother of your children on behalf of them."</p>
<p>I later learned that Father was quoting someone else's words. I was twelve years old at the time and remember that after Father finished speaking, everyone fell into deep thought. I didn't fully understand the meaning of Father's words to my eldest brother. The fireplace in the room was blazing, but I felt a chill in my heart.</p>
<p>Father was a construction engineer. The aesthetic demands of his profession meant that he was often away from home, working on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines. Whenever he came home, he would still pick up his teenage daughter and hug her. All the furniture in the house was of his own unique design. The tables and chairs had no sharp corners because he was afraid we would bump into them. Only a triangular cabinet had three corners, but it was placed in the corner of the wall, so it wouldn't be touched and also saved space.</p>
<p>Father loved his children so much, but apart from material comforts, we lived a very quiet life. Mother loved playing mahjong. She spent five or six days a week at friends' and relatives' houses "clattering away," and even on the one or two days she was home, she was still "clattering away." Moreover, her guests were always numerous, and although we saw Mother's face, we had no opportunity to get close to her. Sometimes, Mother would bring back coffee candies and balloons, which we would find on our pillows the next morning. Mother returned late at night, and we were already asleep. We might dream of Mother kissing us, perhaps as her lips were actually pressing against our cheeks.</p>
<p>After the war broke out, Father, my eldest brother and sister-in-law, Mother, and I scattered to three different places. Mother's "mahjong partners" mostly dispersed. I seized the opportunity to re-enter the scene and regain a mother.</p>
<p>I have only two great aspirations in my life: one is to practice medicine and the other is to teach and nurture talent. When I was studying medicine at university, I came home to "educate" my mother.</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather held the idea that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue." Therefore, Mother only attended school for a very short time. However, most Chinese characters are pictographic or ideographic, and she was very intelligent, so she could generally read newspapers and letters, but she couldn't write herself. She could read the letters Father and my eldest brother sent from afar, but my replies weren't intimate enough for her, and she couldn't write herself. It was impossible for an adult, especially a housewife, to practice calligraphy every day. Her goal was only to learn to write the characters she needed to use. How could one tailor this teaching?</p>
<p>After Mother finished reading a letter, she would always say a few words. Although it was to herself, it was always to answer the meaning in the letter. I tried my best to preserve her tone and wrote a draft for her to copy. At first, she could only copy exactly, but later she gradually learned to change it according to her own meaning. Mother had a strong competitive spirit. She didn't want to show people her childish calligraphy. She copied like this for more than half a year before sending a letter to Father for the first time.</p>
<p>The family letters that Father and I exchanged were called official letters, numbered by date. The ones I sent were designated "Shanghai, Year XX, Number XX." Mother numbered the letters she wrote herself as "Special Number XX," regardless of the year. I thought the word "Special" was very well chosen, showing that she could already understand implicitly, without needing to be told.</p>
<p>After that, I no longer drafted letters for her. She wrote letters only once or twice a month. Her interest in writing grew, and she felt she had too few opportunities to practice, so she learned to keep accounts and write a diary. At first, she also copied from drafts I wrote for her, just like with the letters. When I came home from school, I would hold a pen and listen to her describe the daily chores and financial transactions. Later, she could write herself, and I only corrected her diary and checked her accounts. To facilitate balancing the accounts, she also learned abacus calculation. She was simply better than me at calculating weights and measures. She was used to mental arithmetic in the market, so mental arithmetic plus the abacus was naturally better than just the abacus alone.</p>
<p>Mother only recorded one thing in her diary each day. A description of her method and results for drying broad beans was one entry. When her aunt came, she would put together related events to write an entry, seemingly compiling and recording the diary entries in her mind that she had not written down before. Each day, she could independently create an entry. I once revised a few entries for her and published them under her name in the food, clothing, housing section and family monthly of the Shen Bao newspaper. She was very happy to see them and cut them out to send to Father. Father's reply contained a great deal of joy in its words of encouragement, and even included me: "Such a home tutor, adapting to local conditions, is truly rare, truly rare!"</p>
<p>When Father was in Shanghai, we had four servants at home to serve us four people, the master, mistress, young master, and young miss. Later, my mother and I hired one "big sister" servant. Finally, Mother even let the big sister go, and although she took over the household duties herself, it became quite well organized. Mother would get up before dawn, first going to cultivate a corner of the terrace. It was her garden. She used soap boxes filled with soil to grow plants and also raised a few hens. Mother naturally had an interest in gardening. I remember that when I was little, the courtyard at home was full of all kinds of flowers and plants, and Mother often tended to them herself. Now, she probably felt that resources were scarce and that it wasn't easy to come by food, so she couldn't afford to grow flowers and only grew beans, melons, and vegetables, etc. She often laughed and said it was an experiment for future farming when they returned to their homeland. Fortunately, she watered and fertilized regularly, and she actually had quite a harvest. Half-a-kilogram pumpkins and handfuls of string beans were all part of the harvest. Even if she only harvested six beans from ten soybean plants, she felt it was a good harvest. Mother said, "The terrace doesn't have the earth's essence. It's good enough to see them grow!"</p>
<p>I was studying medicine, so I naturally read magazines on medical health. There were often relatively simple articles in them, and Mother could understand them and apply them in her daily life. She remembered the importance of Vitamins A, B, C, and D and the kinds of foods they could be found in. She often used pickled vegetables to accompany meals because she said they were "life-saving vegetables." Of course, she varied the cooking methods to avoid becoming bored. When tomatoes were in season, she ate them as fruit because tomatoes contain a large amount of Vitamin C, and cooking would destroy it, so they should be eaten raw…</p>
<p>Mother sometimes goes out to play mahjong now, but it is only once in a while and not the kind of day-and-night obsession she used to have. When the time comes, she naturally comes home. She remembers she has household duties to attend to, and that household duties can maintain her sense of responsibility, and that is enough.</p>
<p>In the past, we had a flower room and three reception rooms, but I was very afraid of friends or classmates coming to visit because the person most closely related to the family seemed to be my mother, but where was my mother? She wasn't home! The house was cold and desolate. When I returned from school, I either didn't see her or went to look for her. When she was home, it was all "clatter clatter." When my classmates heard it, they would spread their hands on the table and ask me if I knew how to play. I was extremely embarrassed. It wasn't a home, it was either a wasteland or a club. How could it be considered a home? Now it's different. Come on over! In our bedroom, which also serves as a living room, Mother sits on the bed making clothes. I sit on a small stool by the bed, knitting wool. We chat and laugh. When you come, I'll help Mother make some snacks for you to eat!</p>
<p>When I spend my mornings and evenings at my mother's knee, I am truly a very childish adult. I don't pretend at all. It is completely natural. I have only received true maternal love for five or six years. Isn't it normal for five- or six-year-old children, especially girls, to cling to their mothers' clothes and sit on their laps?</p>
<h3 id="e68">Memories of Bygone Days <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Ping</p>
<p>Time passes like lightning; in the blink of an eye, when pomegranate flowers are red, it is the middle of summer. This summer is not as hot as in the past. The sunlight does not scorch the skin as much, so this summer is like the Spring Festival of old, and everywhere in the universe is full of vitality and excitement. In this season of lush green foliage, fragrant grasses, and singing birds, there is an even greater sense of vigor. The times are constantly changing, and life is also constantly changing, drifting like floating clouds, changing unpredictably. In this universe, a small me has also changed from a student to someone who sits at a desk and lives a salaried life. Every day I do the same monotonous, meaningless work, and sometimes when I think about it alone, I feel an indescribable sense of melancholy and annoyance, as if ants are crawling in my heart. Memories of the past, when all my classmates gathered together, laughing and joking, indelible images are often imprinted in my mind. Now we have all parted ways, and I am all alone. Whenever I think of this, sadness and loneliness fill my heart.</p>
<p>One morning, in the faint light of dawn, I suddenly remembered that yesterday at school, everyone had agreed to meet at seven o'clock this morning and go to the park together. I immediately jumped out of bed. After settling myself, I hurriedly put the things I had prepared yesterday – bread, fruit, a small knife, a ball, etc. – into my bag. I hurriedly ran to the designated meeting place. Several classmates were already there. As it neared seven o'clock, all the classmates had arrived. Everyone rode their bicycles. The breeze was blowing, and I felt very cool and comfortable. Everyone felt very happy along the way. Before long, we arrived. Because it was a holiday, many students were already there enjoying themselves. We were just like birds out of their cages, monkeys freed from their chains, jumping and running, all delighted. Two or three close friends and I lay back on the natural green carpet, listening to the singing of the birds. The fragrance of flowers was carried into our nostrils by the breeze. By then, the sun was almost directly overhead. Patches of purple and red floating clouds dotted the blue sky, drifting like duckweed in flowing water, their changes unpredictable. For a while, it looked like a beautiful painting. For a while, it looked like a flock of sheep. For a while, it looked like celestial maidens scattering flowers, leisurely. The beauty of nature could never be created by human power. We enjoyed this magnificent scenery while eating the snacks and fruit we had brought. Everyone was free and carefree, as if we were in paradise. After everyone finished eating, one classmate suggested climbing the hill, and everyone agreed. Talking and laughing, our sweat soaked our skin. The scorching sunlight was constantly drawing moisture from every part of our bodies. Our skin reacted to the sunlight by emitting heat. We hid under a group of trees. It was very quiet and cool there. Next to the woods was a small pond. The azure sky and the clear water reflected each other, and the reflections in the water included small mountains, trees, and natural colors, all arranged very evenly. The water was as clear as glass, and you could see all the way to the bottom, where many fish were swimming leisurely. Time seemed to pass too quickly. The sun was gradually sinking towards the horizon. We continued to climb the hill, and the clouds in the sky, like human emotions, changed from pure white to light yellow, golden, and even fiery red. The azure sky gradually turned dark blue. Dusk had enveloped the earth. Twilight was approaching. Slender stars peeked out from the clouds, twinkling. The sky was gradually darkening, but the beauty of nature revealed its enchanting magic even more, making people reluctant to leave. But that was when we had to leave together. We left the park, and everyone said goodbye and went their separate ways. The lamplight illuminated our shadows as we walked home.</p>
<p>Recalling this, everything around me seems strangely silent and lonely. I really don't know how to settle down.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Accusation <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Sha</p>
<p>In this era, our emotions are too complicated. It is this surging tide that is reflected in the fervor of our responses. It is this changing human condition that stimulates our pure hearts. There are several changes in one day, and a different feeling every minute.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am too sensitive, or perhaps my life has been marked by hardship, or perhaps I take everything too seriously, or perhaps my demands on the environment are too harsh, or perhaps my life is too focused on mental labor, with the spiritual far exceeding the material. Because of all these reasons, my emotions are trapped in a constant and fierce struggle.</p>
<p>This fierce struggle arises from this complicated era, with its complex contradictions. These contradictions are not simply emotional issues, nor are they simply rational issues. Many think that reason is good and can be used to restrain emotions, while many think that emotions can be developed freely. But the reality is not so simple.</p>
<p>What I long for and praise is what I am separated from and say goodbye to, and you don't even utter a half-sentence of comfort in my dreams. What I admire and revere is limited by reality, and I cannot possibly allow you to express your feelings and attachments. I miss old friends, and I miss the past I struggled through. Old friends are gone without a word, and the past has turned to ashes, falling into emptiness and sadness.</p>
<p>Facing reality, I must summon the courage to live, for food, for coping, for survival. Just for the sake of such small individual material needs, I have consumed my youth and my time.</p>
<p>A job is meant to solve the problem of living. Now, I am in a position that is quite interesting and in line with my aspirations. I once vowed to dedicate myself to this career. To this day, this vow remains unchanged. I seem to have gained some technical skills over time, but it is still so far from what I originally wanted!</p>
<p>The most tragic thing is being restricted by reality. The way I look at all problems should be black, but now it must be white. Something that is actually good is smeared with the stain of evil. For someone who is worldly, this is nothing. But for someone with a full heart of passion, even if they try to control themselves with "calm reason," and reluctantly write what they dare not believe, this contradictory psychology is constantly destroying that originally pure heart and replacing it with "an empty, indifferent ghost lacking a sense of justice"?</p>
<p>How can this be willingly accepted?</p>
<p>The truth is most correct. The official must require you to do so, and you must not reveal your worries. Too much doubt and confusion is detrimental. – This is also a theory, a realistic view that is the final conclusion.</p>
<p>But the problem does not end there. In addition to a good job, there are many other trivial life problems. Solving the issues of food, clothing, housing, and transportation is enough to add countless worries to a salaried worker. The seasons in the city are constantly changing, and the material desires of the city are also terrible. Living in the city, one must spend all of their energy trying to seize material pleasures.</p>
<p>Will the passion of childhood and the beautiful dreams grow old along with the wrinkles on my forehead?</p>
<p>Am I sinking into the mud of personal gain, just to kneel before the old society for such narrow interests?</p>
<p>How can this be willingly accepted?</p>
<p>Love, hate, new, old, truth, heresy, career, future…</p>
<p>All kinds of inseparable contradictions are intertwined to form the emotions of young people in this era. Young people struggling in these contradictions are in an extremely sharp struggle every day, every hour. Therefore, excitement, frustration, joy, sorrow, hope, despair, confusion, hesitation, wandering… there are dozens of changes in a day, and the mood is different every minute?</p>
<p>If the bowstring of emotion is stretched too tight, it will break one day. The torrent of contradictions buried in the heart will burst one day.</p>
<p>At that time, perhaps it will be the day this era is destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Dust <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>Huimin lazily went to play chess, stopping at the doorway. He unintentionally glanced at the portrait of Jiang Shang pasted on the door, covered in dust, and couldn't help but shudder. That wizened face coldly stared at him in the dim light. Having lived here for so many years, he suddenly realized the gloominess and loneliness of this house. A beam of sunlight poured in through the dusty skylight, dust sparkling, rising and falling. In the corner, a white-haired cat curled up, twitching its whiskers, squinting at him, as if questioning, "Why do you disturb my afternoon nap?" The air was filled with a heavy incense smoke. Huimin thought:</p>
<p>"The old man is smoking!" So, he gently knocked on the door, subconsciously holding his ears to listen.</p>
<p>An old cough answered him.</p>
<p>"Father..." He opened the door and hesitantly walked towards the antique rattan couch.</p>
<p>"Father..."</p>
<p>"Speak your mind!" His father replied in a沉着 voice. The pale yellow lamplight reflected on his ashen face, appearing gloomy and imposing.</p>
<p>Huimin shuddered again, stammering:</p>
<p>"I was thinking of leaving for Suzhou tomorrow or the day after..."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"There's a job opportunity there!" Hesitating, the son took a letter from his pocket and presented it to his father, adding, "Sent by an old classmate."</p>
<p>The old man stared blankly at the letter, seemingly looking but not seeing. After a long silence, he suddenly shouted sternly, "Your appearance doesn't look like you can handle official affairs! Wearing a collar, a sleeping cap, and slippers, loafing around all day, lazy, greedy, and addicted to gambling! What can you do if you go there!"</p>
<p>Huimin stood as straight as a soldier on parade. He secretly took off his sleeping cap.</p>
<p>"Is there someone there named Li?" the old man asked slowly.</p>
<p>"He's an old classmate," the son bowed and said, "How would I dare deceive you, old man?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't dare deceive me? You think I don't understand your thoughts! These past few days, your heart has been restless again, thinking about going outside for good things! A father knows his son best, how could I not see through you? If you want to go, then go!"</p>
<p>"Father..." He rubbed his hands, not knowing what to say. The old man closed his eyes, indicating, "Anything you say after this is in vain!"</p>
<p>Silence! The bamboo mat was heavy, the room gloomy, and the smoke lamp flickered with dim light.</p>
<p>"I was thinking..." Huimin tried to pick up the thread of the conversation.</p>
<p>"You're thinking, you're thinking of asking me for money, aren't you?" The old man's eyes were like two headlights on a car.</p>
<p>Huimin was stunned and knelt before the couch:</p>
<p>"Father! Please, give me another chance! This time I go out, I will definitely work hard. After waiting at home for so long, I have completely realized my past mistakes..."</p>
<p>He didn't know what tone to use to express what he wanted to say next. In this kind of situation, how difficult is it to confess your heart? If you treat it indifferently, he'll say you don't take repentance seriously; if you cry and wail, looking very sad, he'll think you're being hypocritical. Huimin sobbed for a while and then lowered his head—silence is golden, he understood his father's psychology.</p>
<p>Huimin walked lightly downstairs. A novelist might describe his mood like this: like the earth caressed by the warm morning sun. He stopped halfway at the corner.</p>
<p>"Amin, buy the ticket and come back!" the old man instructed.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, old man!" He pursed his lips at the mottled black door and stepped into his bedroom.</p>
<p>His wife excitedly greeted him, asking:</p>
<p>"Did Father agree?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" Huimin patted the banknotes in his pocket; "I'll go buy the ticket right away."</p>
<p>"I say... I say that this time you go out, you must be single-minded in your work..." His wife put on his leather shoes for him, nagging him.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to nag so much? Don't you trust me?"</p>
<p>"It's not that I don't trust you," his wife sighed, "You know the suffering that you, I, and the children have endured these past few years..."</p>
<p>Huimin silently walked towards the mirror, buttoning his collar.</p>
<p>"Suffering and humiliation torment us!" his wife continued, "You and I have lost that passionate vitality we had when we first got married..."</p>
<p>Two pairs of eyes stared at the wedding photo hanging next to the mirror.</p>
<p>"The children have also suffered innocently, and shadows have gripped their young and weak hearts!" She began to sob: "I remember when we first came out of college..."</p>
<p>Two pairs of eyes then shifted to the academic photo hanging on the other side.</p>
<p>"We imagined our married life to be so bright!" She collapsed into Huimin's arms.</p>
<p>"A bright life is about to begin!" He stroked his wife's soft hair: "You know I'm not a fool! Foolishness only occupied my mind for a moment, at that time, delusions tempted me, and lust boiled in my blood! But once that moment passed, wasn't I still the same as I was ten years ago? I love you, I love our children! The pain almost made me wish I was dead!"</p>
<p>"Huimin! It's better if you don't go!" His wife hugged him tightly: "When you are by my side, I feel a kind of strength that makes me trust you. But don't get angry; when you leave me, I feel afraid, I'm afraid that moment will come again, that delusions will tempt you!"</p>
<p>"Don't doubt it, I will definitely do a good job this time!" Huimin said, "I want to rescue you and the children from suffering and leave this gloomy and lonely house!"</p>
<p>The following dialogue involves trivial matters, such as luggage, hats, etc. I will not record them word for word.</p>
<p>At four o'clock, Huimin went out fully dressed. He went out the back door and then turned back. He listened for a while at the bottom of the stairs and then secretly went to the kitchen. He took a bowl from the cupboard, wiped it with the hem of his clothes, and threw down two dice—to test his luck.</p>
<p>"Damn it, why did I have to do that?" He left angrily.</p>
<p>Just as Huimin threw the two dice, his wife collapsed on the bed. She sobbed, muttering to herself excitedly. She thought about how to encourage him again when Huimin returned.</p>
<p>Soon, she gradually fell asleep. When she woke up, the clock pointed to half-past seven. Darkness was already peeking through the window, and she couldn't help but shiver—he hadn't returned yet.</p>
<p>After dinner, the old man called her in. He asked her if Huimin had come back.</p>
<p>She replied, appearing very calm:</p>
<p>"He has already come back, and the ticket has been bought. He went to see a friend just now, probably to discuss work matters."</p>
<p>The old man looked at her suspiciously, cursed a few times, and told her to have Huimin come to see him immediately when he returned.</p>
<p>Then she returned to the bedroom and looked out the window, as if waking up from a nightmare. Huimin was wearing only a thin undershirt, barefoot, walking slowly outside the door. He reached out his hand—that hand that had repeatedly exchanged delusions for disillusionment—knocking on the back door.</p>
<p>"Forgive me one more time!" Seeing his wife stick her head out, he pleaded. The cold chilled him to the bone, and he shivered incessantly.</p>
<p>Now, delusions are exchanged for disillusionment; hope only blossoms in dreams. A moment of destruction; two people, one still waiting! This day is like dust: rising from darkness, and sinking back into darkness. And this life is like this day: hope and disillusionment...</p>
<p>Huimin cannot escape this gloomy and lonely house. His wife secretly let him in, and he tiptoed to the bedroom and fell on the bed.</p>
<p>"Is this a trap you created, in order to deceive the old man?" his wife asked crying, shaking his body. He didn't say a word, just...</p>
<p>Naturally, he didn't need to answer; he had woven a trap for himself and then put it on his own head, imprisoning himself in this gloomy and lonely house!</p>

<h3 id="e71">Roundtable Ping Pong, an Interesting Sport Worth Promoting <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xucang</p>
<p>Mr. Xucang is an educator, but his contributions to the sports world are also considerable. Like the introduction of the center ball and the invention of the round door ball, he has added a noteworthy page to sports history. Recently, he has been studying "roundtable ping pong." This sport is quite novel and very interesting. Below are his writings on roundtable ping pong, which will surely be welcomed by enthusiasts. - Editor</p>
<p>It happened two years ago. I happened to see a foreign scientific magazine at a friend's place and unintentionally discovered a somewhat blurry photograph of roundtable ping pong. Under the photograph, a short article was printed, which aroused my interest at the time. However, the explanation was too simple, and no rules were attached, which was regrettable. After some time, this interesting matter was completely forgotten. In recent months, Shanghai's economy has been declining, and some amateur leisure spots seem to be gradually withering due to malnutrition. Ping pong rooms or billiard rooms have replaced them. Especially ping pong, which is popular everywhere and at its peak. This made me recall roundtable ping pong. One day, I talked with senior figures in the sports world, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, Mr. Zhang Baokui, and pioneers in the ping pong world, Chen Linsheng and Gusheng, about introducing roundtable ping pong to sports enthusiasts in Shanghai. They all expressed their full support, so I increased my determination to introduce and design it. In fact, I am not qualified for the job of designing this item. Because I have never met this roundtable ping pong before, nor do I know its family history. I only vaguely recognized its face in a photograph, and I only knew that a new toy had been produced in that part of the world. Now that I'm seriously introducing it, I can only rely on my own imagination to create new content for it and set temporary rules. Although there is bound to be the saying that "oranges become trifoliate oranges when transplanted north of the Huai River," it is no small matter to give sports enthusiasts in Shanghai another fun tool for recreation in their spare time. Fortunately, this is just a sports anecdote, and there is no lack of precedent for revising the rules in the future, so I took some time to roughly define the scale. If someone can put it into practice and revise any inconsistencies at any time, that would be my greatest hope.</p>
<h3 id="e72">I. Equipment Installation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Among ball sports, the equipment for ping pong can be considered simple. Just prepare a table, net, racket, net frame, and ball, and you can play ping pong enthusiastically. Then the equipment and installation of roundtable ping pong are not complicated either.</p>
<p>(A) Round Ping Pong Table</p>
<p>The surface can be made of any material, but it must be smooth and elastic. The standard of elasticity is that a standard ball dropped from a height of 30.5 cm from the surface should have an average elasticity of 20.3 cm to 22.9 cm. The radius of the round surface is 1.3725 meters. The height of the surface from the ground is 0.762 meters. The installation of the surface must be level. All of the table legs should be painted in non-reflective black. The periphery of the round table surface should be painted with a white border line 1.9 cm wide from the edge. For three-person roundtable ping pong, the round table should be divided into three equal fan shapes, each fan shape having an arc of 120 degrees, each central angle also being 120 degrees, and three equal radii also being painted with 1.9 cm wide white lines. If it is four-person roundtable ping pong, then the round table is divided into four equal fan shapes, each fan shape having an arc length and central angle of 90 degrees, and the original three radii are of course changed to two, mutually perpendicular diameters.</p>
<p>(B) Ping Pong Columns</p>
<p>The columns are not limited by material. Three-person roundtable ping pong uses four columns, one installed in the center of the round area, and three installed on the circumference at equal distances. The top of the column is 17.1 cm above the table surface, and the column should be at right angles to the surface. The diameter of the cross-section of the column is 1.9 cm. The column feet cannot extend horizontally beyond the table surface. Four-person ping pong uses a total of five columns, one installed in the center of the circle, and the remaining four installed at four equal points on the circumference. The height and thickness of the columns are the same as the three-person system.</p>
<p>(C) Ping Pong Net</p>
<p>The three-person net has a total of three strips, each extending from the central ping pong column to the ping pong column on the circumference, diagonally dividing the round table surface into three equal sections. The four-person net has a total of four strips, and the installation method is the same as the three-person system, vertically dividing the round table surface into four equal sections. The width of the net is 17.2 cm. The color of the net should be white. The mesh should be 1.9 cm square. The upper edge of the net should be sewn with a 1.9 cm wide colored net edge. The two ends of the net should be tightly attached to the top of the ping pong columns so that the upper edge of the net is level.</p>
<p>(D) Ball and Racket</p>
<p>The ball and racket are exactly the same as those described in the ordinary ping pong rules, so I will not repeat them.</p>
<h3 id="e73">II. Rules <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Roundtable ping pong is derived from the original ordinary ping pong, and the rules it uses are of course largely similar to the original rules, but due to the different shapes, positions, equipment installations, and number of people, some places cannot be exactly the same. Now, the different places are listed below.</p>
<p>(A) Three-Person Elimination System</p>
<p>This is a game that provides for three people to play at the same time. Below are a few points that differ from ordinary ping pong:</p>
<p>1. (Position) The positions where the three people should stand are determined by drawing lots. The first place can choose a good position and the right to serve. The second place can choose the second-best position, and the remaining position belongs to the third place.</p>
<p>2. (Scoring) Ordinary ping pong rules use a scoring system. Three-person roundtable ping pong should change to a point-loss system due to the triangular league relationship. The first of the three to lose 11 points is considered to have lost a game. If two people or two people lose 10 points each at the same time, then the person who loses two more points should be the first to lose a game.</p>
<p>3. (Serve) The person who wins the right to serve is the server, and the remaining two are the receivers. The server first throws the ball up and hits it with the racket, so that the ball bounces up within his area and then crosses the net and falls into any of the left and right areas, which is called a serve. The right to serve next time is won by the person who loses points each time.</p>
<p>4. (Receive) The person receiving the ball can return the ball to any of the left and right two areas, but cannot send it to the same area three or more times in a row. By way of example: the first time A gives to B, B can also return it to A the first time, the second time A can give it to B again, B can also return it to A the second time, the third time A cannot give it to B again, he must give it to C, otherwise A and B will play until dawn, and C will wait until dawn, wouldn't that be a joke.</p>
<p>5. (Elimination) The three, A, who first loses 11 points, is eliminated and counts as third place. The remaining two, because they cannot play roundtable ping pong, determine the level of the name based on the number of points lost. The one with fewer points lost is first place, and the one with the next fewest is second place. If, when the first person is eliminated, the remaining two people have exactly the same points, then calculate the last point lost by the two people. Whoever loses this point last is first.</p>
<p>(B) Four-Person Elimination System</p>
<p>Regarding the rules of the four-person elimination system, such as position, scoring, serve, and elimination, they are the same as the three-person elimination system, only slightly changing the scope of the ball. The four-person system cannot send to the same area two or more times in a row. Because the number of people increases by one, the opportunity to send the ball also increases by one area, and the scope of attack expands. It is very beneficial to the attacking side. From the perspective of defending, the larger the area, the more difficult it is to defend, and there is an uneasy psychology of everyone being in danger. Naturally, the number of times to send to the same area cannot exceed two or more times. According to an example: the first time A gives to B, B can also return it to A the first time, the second time A cannot give it to B again, it must be given to C or D.</p>
<p>(C) Four-Person Doubles System</p>
<p>Doubles is a game of confrontation between two people as a group. The positions and the right to serve chosen by both sides are determined by drawing lots. If the group that wins the draw is willing to be the server or receiver, then the other side has the right to choose the position. If the winner of the draw is willing to choose the position, then the other side has the right to decide whether to be the server or receiver first. However, when the winner of the draw is willing, he can still give the priority of choice to his opponent. The standing positions of the remaining two people form a straight line facing each other. The serving rules are the same as before, and the target of the shot is of course to attack the two enemies on the left and right, but when necessary, it can also be shot into the area of the teammate on the opposite side, in order to rest and wait for an opportunity to enter directly. However, it is not allowed to shoot twice or more in a row into the area of the same team. The scoring method adopts a scoring system, which is the opposite of the previous section. Whoever scores 11 points first wins a game. Two wins determine the outcome. The right to serve adopts a rotating system, which is the same as the ordinary ping pong rules, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<h3 id="e74">III. Advantages <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The rules of roundtable ping pong are different from ordinary ping pong, so it naturally has its advantages and disadvantages. Now, I will list a few points below:</p>
<p>1. Roundtable ping pong is a game that three or four people play together, which can indirectly cultivate keen intelligence, because when facing enemies on two or three sides, you must be careful to defend at all times. The attacker must always peek at the enemy's gap and launch a surprise attack, while the defender must also always peek at the direction of the attack and implement the defense. Both sides seek survival in this tense environment, and the habit of wit is cultivated invisibly.</p>
<p>2. In all sports or games, both sides rely on strength, wit, and opportunity to compete. Often, if the strength of the three is very different, they will not be interested, and at the same time, the weaker party rarely has a chance to win. Like chess games, everything depends on strength and wit. A person whose strength and wit are not as good as the opponent's can almost be said to have no possibility of victory. The strength of roundtable ping pong is not like ordinary games. Even a person who has no experience can barely cope with it. The use of opportunities is more than in ordinary ping pong, and the use of opportunities is equal. When the strength of the two sides is very different, they can often use the luck of "bumping into a corner" to catch the opponent off guard. Therefore, I believe that roundtable ping pong has a more mass-oriented performance than ordinary ping pong.</p>
<p>3. Roundtable ping pong is quite common in Chinese families, because there are few families in China with large western-style tables, but round table surfaces are very common. In large families, if you need to add a round table surface, you may as well add a two-sided round table ping pong table (painted for three people on the front and painted for four people on the back), and have fun after dinner.</p>
<p>The so-called learning mahjong is more beneficial. As for the number of participants, it is more than ordinary ping pong, which is naturally also a good thing.</p>
<h3 id="e75">IV. Disadvantages <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>1. Because roundtable ping pong is limited by the narrow area, it is often impossible to make a powerful long shot when hitting the ball, so you cannot use the wonderful hitting methods unique to ordinary ping pong. Ordinary ping pong focuses on long straight shots, while roundtable ping pong uses left and right arc shots. Long shots are enjoyable, but arc shots lack strength.</p>
<p>2. Because roundtable ping pong is narrow in many positions, the chances of touching the net and committing suicide and going off-road are more than in ordinary ping pong. Three or five rounds, that is, broken, lack of interesting continuity, which will reduce the interest of the players.</p>
<p>3. The attacking and defending area of both sides is fan-shaped, with the front sharp and the back closed. Many attacking and defending stunts, such as forehand and backhand shots, emergency rescues at the bottom, and chops, cannot be applied. Therefore, the skills of the players become boring and simplified.</p>
<p>The above only uses my knowledge of a little experience in ordinary ping pong to give roundtable ping pong new content, and design it at will, which is naturally inevitable with the drawback of building a car behind closed doors. As for the rules, I can only list the main points here, and the details will be printed in another book. I hope that ping pong, seniors, and those who have special interest in roundtable ping pong, can correct them at any time in the experiment. At the same time, I hope that schools, youth associations, and ping pong rooms can take the lead in promoting it. If there are any questions, you can discuss them.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Basketball League B Group Branch Champions Produced A Bird's-Eye View of the Strength of Each Team <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— (Skinny Reporter)</p>
<p>There are a total of forty-nine heroic divisions participating in this year's Basketball League B Group, divided into seven parts, each with seven teams. After the branch champions are produced first, the B Group champions will then adopt an elimination system to hold the finals to determine who will be the B Group overall champion. However, the Sixth Strong Division of B Group withdrew temporarily the day before the opening, so only forty-eight teams participated in the competition, resulting in the branch schedule. Since the curtain was opened on March 21, after two months of competition, the champions of each group have been produced by yesterday afternoon. The bureau will soon convene the teams to draw lots to hold the overall finals. Now I will introduce the strength of each branch champion.</p>
<h3 id="e77">First Group Feidui (Flying Team) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Feidui is mostly composed of the Zhao brothers, and the Liu generals of the Yijia Ban (Suitable Family Team) are comparable to the Hua Nan brothers. The team has a ball rack in their private house, so they practice day and night, and their cooperation skills are excellent. However, because they are all young, their strength may not be enough. However, with the guidance of Xu Zhitai, a veteran of basketball, they will definitely continue to work hard and give full play to their abilities at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Second Group Longhua <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Longhua has been established for a considerable amount of time, and its record is above the standard. Many of the team members are alumni of the former Guoguang Middle School, so their foundation is very good. Zhang Jin and Ma Canxi have been guided by them successively, which makes them even more outstanding. Chen and Chen Zhengmiao are especially outstanding, and they have ambitions for the overall championship.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Third Group Feima (Flying Horse) <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The members of Feima team are very progressive and work hard, so they were able to win the championship of this group, which is by no means accidental. The team's forward Wu Junkui shoots very well, and the guard has unique features. The team's overall skills seem to be slightly inferior, but with their hard-working spirit, they may achieve unexpected results.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Fourth Team, Youlu <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Youlu team members, such as Lin Hongci and Wang Yuguang, are already quite renowned in the basketball world and naturally possess a superior level of experience. Their future prospects depend on this experience, which is more valuable than their skills alone. However, basketball games also heavily rely on experience; therefore, this team holds great promise.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Fifth Team, Chengfu <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Chengfu team is organized by employees of the Chengfu Company. They participate in every league match and have never forfeited. Therefore, their previous records were mediocre. Lately, through repeated competitions, they have made significant progress. This time, winning the division championship truly rewards their hard work. The author greatly admires the team's commendable spirit. Although they may not have high hopes for the overall championship, this achievement is already a source of pride.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Sixth Team, Blue Team <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Blue Team luckily defeated the Xinxie team yesterday, winning the sixth division championship. Certain members like Shi Qiaokui and Zhu Zhonglin are indeed respected figures in the banking sector. Others like Xu Kun and Wu Han are emerging talents. Combining new and experienced players in one team allowed them to achieve this result. After participating in the finals, they should give a superior performance.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Seventh Team, Zhenyuan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenyuan team is organized by colleagues from the Zhenyuan Pawnshop, led by Weng Wen. They consistently practice in their spare time, so their skills improve rapidly. Within the second division groups, they can already be considered outstanding. Whether it's individual technique or teamwork, they are remarkable and are undoubtedly a promising team.</p>
<p>Looking at all seven teams, many are up and comers, that if they meet later, and each put forth their best effort, their performance will be fresh and attention grabbing.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Guest Team Performance During the Finals <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>It is recently learned that during the second division finals, the Basketball League veteran referees team will participate as guest performers. It is also heard that the Ligang basketball team will participate in a three-way exhibition. The Ligang team is organized by staff of the *Li Bao* sports section. Team members such as Dongfeng, Lü Cheng, Hongchen, Shi, Qiu Shigong, Huang Di, Ma Ye, and Mei Jie are all veteran players. The Ligang team has now been established and is actively training, so there will definitely be many highlights at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Volleyball League Registration Deadline – Hope for Enthusiastic Participation from All Teams <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>This year's volleyball league, due to venue issues, will move from indoors to outdoors. The author has always felt that as long as there's no wind, outdoors is far better than indoors, because development is easier, especially when saving the ball. Therefore, I predict that this year's competition will be much more intense and the standard will certainly improve significantly. However, to date, the number of teams registering is not very high. For the A teams, there are Zhongbei, White Team, and Sanxing, etc. It is uncertain whether the Russian community team and the Soviet team can be formed. Regarding the women's teams, the Yuan team and the Zhi team both have issues. Sanxing and Huayan have already registered. Today is the last day for registration, and it is hoped that all volleyball teams will enthusiastically participate, so that this year's volleyball league will achieve even better results due to being held outdoors. (Huai *)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Essentials of Basketball Theory (20) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>The positional attack method is a relatively slow tactic, hence it is also generally known as a slow attack method. It is the second type of tactic adopted when a fast break is not possible. Its advantage lies in short-distance passing, which is strong and healthy, able to lure opponents, wait for opportunities to advance, and can be repeated. Therefore, it is most suitable for teams with lower skill levels, older players, teams experiencing fatigue, and for breaking the five-man zone defense. However, its weakness lies in initiating the attack. For example, when using a central breakthrough, the ball is bounced off the ground, rebounding near the opponent's center's feet and passed to a teammate running diagonally forward, allowing them to catch the ball ahead of the opponent on the free-throw line, then turn around and pass it to a teammate running forward along the sidelines for a shot, or dribble up themselves to score. If all three methods fail, the ball is passed back to the guard, who then seeks another opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>If using a sidelong sneak attack method, the ball is passed to a teammate running along the sideline, allowing them to turn their back to block the opponent while passing the ball back to the guard, leaving an open path for the guard to dribble forward and shoot, or pass to two teammates running forward toward the center and the corner for a shot. If this method is also blocked by the opponent, the ball is passed back to the guard again, the position is shifted, and a third attack is launched.</p>
<p>At this time, it may be changed to an outside attack and inside response tactic. The center moves to the basket, and the two forwards line up with them on the baseline. The two guards pass the ball to each other outside. When the opponent is not paying attention, the two forwards lead the defenders forward and try to block them, leaving the center open under the basket. The guard then uses an overhead pass to pass the ball to the center, who jumps up to score, ideally tipping it in mid-air.</p>
<p>If the opposing defense is strong and there is no room to maneuver, and we have a higher score, then we can stop attacking and use a stalling tactic, using an outside mutual passing method to preserve our lead.</p>
<p>In fact, the positional attack method is not unable to defeat the "man-to-man" defense, but the battle situation has fewer changes and is not as popular with the audience as other tactics. Especially when using the stalling tactic, commonly known as "short on mahjong". Therefore, in this situation, the audience often shouts "open a soda," disliking the boring lack of excitement.</p>
<p>Positional attack tactics do not often involve rapid attacks. Usually, after the team gains possession of the ball, it is given to the two guards to dribble forward, or one person dribbles while the other follows to protect, or two people use short-distance mutual passing to cross the center line, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The two forwards quickly run to the corners on the side, drawing the opponent to disperse the defensive line, while the center moves to the free-throw line or near the sideline and free-throw line extension, in order to arrange the formation and indicate who will start the attack.</p>
<p>Once the positional attack is set up, the task of luring the enemy can begin. The two guards constantly pass the ball back and forth in front of the formation, or rotate, or nudge each other, or feign attacks, passing the ball to the center and then passing it out, disrupting the opponent's vision, making it impossible to figure out when and from where to attack. The two forwards can run back and forth along the sidelines and end lines, or switch positions with the center, diagonally running across the free-throw area, then walking along the sidelines to the corner in a figure-eight pattern or a turntable pattern, drawing the opponent away from their positions in order to take advantage of openings.</p>
<p>The two guards both pass the ball back and forth, and simultaneously look for opportunities to attack. If there is an opening, they will not let it go. Such simple, varied formations are difficult to explain without diagrams and cannot be used without proper training. This is just one example.</p>
<h3 id="e87">C. Blocking Offensive Method <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The blocking offensive method, in English is "Blocking System," also known as Screening, is a modern tactic used to break through the enemy's formation. It is most effective against the "man-to-man" defense and out-of-bounds plays. It has many names, including "Play Key-man Screening," single-knife and scissor-shaped blocking, sideline blocking, and central zone blocking. The method of blocking can involve one, two, or three people blocking, depending on the game situation and the coach's experience. However, the most commonly used is the main enemy blocking method. The so-called main enemy blocking method is to block one of the main opponents, in order to create an open path so that the teammate with the ball can attack along this path without being marked by the enemy. This method is relatively simple and easy to implement and can be used in conjunction with various other offensive methods without changing the original overall strategy, so coaches often prefer to use it. However, this tactic is not without weaknesses. The most obvious is that it is easily countered by the five-man zone defense, and when it is not implemented flexibly, it is often detected by the opponent, who can adjust positions in time to defend against it, rendering it a futile effort.</p>
<p>Overall, skilled players must use a sort of deception, such as a smokescreen-like technique, before implementing a blocking tactic, so the enemy doesn't know they are being blocked. For example, feigning going forward to catch the ball, or following the enemy running toward the basket to steal the ball, or standing still shouting and gesturing, asking teammates to pass the ball, or indicating the direction of the teammate's attack, deceiving the enemy and secretly blocking the nearest enemy, isolating them on the sideline, or trapping them in a certain location, preventing them from running out in time to steal the teammate's ball, so the teammate with the ball can boldly attack. Therefore, the most important thing about blocking is to prevent the enemy from anticipating being blocked; the position when blocking the enemy must be such that it is difficult for the enemy to come out in time to block the teammate with the ball; and every effort should be made to avoid touching the enemy's body and committing a foul. According to the rules, all defensive prohibitions that do not involve physical contact have now been removed. In other words, as long as there is no physical contact, any blocking method is permissible. This is even more advantageous for adopting the blocking offensive method.</p>
<p>When using the blocking method to break the "man-to-man" defense, the commonly used formations can be roughly divided into the following three types:</p>
<p>The first type belongs to the full-court cooperative method. Suppose that after the opponent scores, our team starts attacking from the end line with an out-of-bounds play. The method of formation is to have the left guard inbound the ball on the end line, the right guard stand on the left side of the opposing team's free-throw area, the two forwards stand on the side of the court near the center line, and the center stand in the middle of the court in front of our free-throw line to disperse the enemy.</p>
<p>At the start of the attack, the right guard first walks toward the left forward's side of the court, pretending to be looking for a path. In fact, the player going forward will block the defender guarding the forward, so that the left forward is not marked, runs forward, and catches the ball inbounded by the left guard from out of bounds. At this time, the center walks toward the right side of the court and secretly blocks the defender guarding the right forward, allowing the forward to run out and catch the pass from the left forward. After throwing the ball inbounds, the left guard immediately rushes straight to the basket from the left side of the court, catches the long pass from the right forward in front of the basket, and then shoots it in. This method can be used in combination with fast breaks, no center jump, or out-of-bounds play offensive methods, and can also be called sideline blocking, diagonal attack method.</p>
<p>The second type of formation is assumed to be used during positional attack. The formation method is to have the center and the left and right forwards stand in a row in front of the end line in the front court, and the two guards stand on the left and right sides of the court near the center line, forming a situation of two people attacking from the outside and three people responding from the inside. There are many ways to use this formation to attack. Here is an example to illustrate the general idea.</p>
<p>At the start of the attack, the normal positional attack method is still used, with the two guards passing the ball back and forth and passing it over the center line. The other three people quickly run forward to the front court end line to set up the formation. When the ball is passed over the center line and is in the hands of the left guard, the forward on the right corner of the court starts running forward along the sideline, and when the ball is passed to the right guard, the player suddenly grabs the right guard pass in front of the enemy following up. At this time, the center runs forward one or two steps from under the basket and blocks the enemy marking the forward at the left corner, allowing the forward to escape, walk to the front of the basket, catch the pass from the right forward, and then shoot in. This method is one type of key enemy blocking (Key-man Screening). It can also be called a two-attack three-response main enemy blocking offensive method.</p>
<p>The third type is a three-attack blocking positional attack method. Its formation is the opposite of the previous one, with three people attacking from the outside and two people responding from the inside. Except for the center standing in the middle of the two guards outside the formation, the positions of the rest of the players are the same as in the previous formation. There are countless ways to use this formation to attack. Here, one of the simpler ways will be explained briefly.</p>
<p>When launching an attack, it should be after the two guards have passed the ball to each other over the center line. At this time, any guard can pass the ball to the center. As soon as the ball reaches the center's hands, the forward on the right corner of the court begins running forward along the sideline. When the player reaches the intersection of the free-throw line and the sideline, the player will be in front of the enemy marking themselves in order to receive the ball. Seeing that the forward has gone forward, the center will pass the ball to the right guard. After receiving the ball, the right guard rotates toward the sideline and passes the ball to the forward. After passing the ball to the right guard, the center turns around, bypasses the center blocking the enemy, walks to the free-throw area, catches the pass back from the right forward, and dribbles forward, jumps, and shoots. This is a three-attack two-response, sideline main enemy blocking offensive method.</p>
<p>If the strategy changes the formation to a central breakthrough blocking offensive method, then after the center catches the ball, the right guard runs to the right side of the enemy marking the center, using a feint, pretending to have other intentions, and secretly blocks the enemy, allowing the center to bypass the right guard and, with a solo attack, dribble into the central area and jump up to score near the basket. This method is very simple to describe, but in practice, the entire team must cooperate, lead the enemy to disperse, and make them not pay attention. Without the close cooperation of the right guard and the center, it is difficult to get results. (Note) The section from "In summary" to "countering its unpredictable blocking methods" in the previous article is a conclusion on modern defensive methods.</p>
