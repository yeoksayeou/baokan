<h3>日「義烈空挺隊」壯舉　降落冲繩敵機塲　乘月夜奇襲收獲重大戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日大本營二十五日下午四時三十分發表：　陸軍大尉奧山道郎指揮之日特別攻擊隊「義烈空挺隊」，五月二十四日夜，於冲繩本島北·中兩機塲降陸，立即炸毀地上敵機及軍需倉庫，機塲設施等，使敵陷於混亂狀態，刻正收獲大戰果。　策應上項攻擊之日特別飛行攻擊隊，刻對冲繩島周圍之敵艦船，展閒猛攻中。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日陸軍大尉奧山道郞所率之特攻隊「義烈空挺部隊」，二十四日之月夜，突然降落冲繩本島之敵軍北。中兩機塲中。敵於本島登陸以來，地上戰鬥已歷五旬，其間日軍備隊隊迎擊敵軍之攻擊，維持首里北方陣地，二十四日以來，敵軍雖加入新銳兵力，熾烈掩護前進，然日守備隊不讓寸土，勇敢反擊，予敵以重創。洞悉地時，於奇義北·中兩機塲成功後，即以所携之炸彈，毀該機塲之敵機軍需倉庫及機塲設施，敵機塲守備隊，陷於大混亂，刻正繼續擴大戰果中。於義烈空挺隊奇襲攻擊之先，日軍機隊大舉出動，對北·中兩機塲及伊江島機塲，加以猛烈攻擊，義烈隊即乘斯時，敢行降落着地，因此兩着址，雖均謀逃往空母，然而其大部皆白葬於地上或海中。由於陸上海上雙管齊下之特攻作戰，予敵陣營以莫大打擊。那首覇里北方一帶之日守備隊，望見義烈空挺隊之奮戰與特攻隊時，士氣更爲昂揚。</p>
<h3>嘉手納及慶良間　海面迭起大火柱　日特攻飛行隊展開猛攻</h3>
<p>南西羣島基地二十五日中央社電　日軍特別攻擊隊及航空部隊，二十四日攻擊冲繩周邊之敵艦船及飛機塲，冲繩本爲北飛機塲有二處起大爆炸，數次大火，對於艦船攻擊之詳細戰果，尚未查明。在嘉手納海面及慶良間羣島方面，認明有十九條大火柱，日軍部隊於二十四日至二十五日晨，繼續攻擊，此外，二十三日夜起至二十四日上午三時許止，那覇之西北海面。認明有艦種不詳老二艘起火。</p>
<p>日守備隊　寡兵敵衆</p>
<p>南方基地二十五日中央社電中二十一，二十二日再取正規攻勢之冲繩本島敵軍，在第一綫出動戰車若干輛，兵員約三千人，對日軍主要陣地强行進迫，日守備部隊將士寡兵敵衆，於各處將敵攻分粉碎，阻止共侵入，現日美兩軍戰鬥之對峙線，爲迎結運玉森方面，二五○高地，石嶺，大名，首里近郊之平良町，五七高地，傎嘉比南側，首里等地一帶戰線，敵攻勢重點置於運玉森正面東海岸平坦地區及西部之眞嘉比，大名，安里地區，採取集中攻擊，二十三日晨，敵軍約五百名，出動戰車十餘輛，向運玉森南方海岸之與那原侵入，刻正與該處日軍交戰中。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據紐約廣播，紐約泰晤士報記者羅來斯，隨軍至琉球担任工作，日前電致該報，報道戰况稱，美第一師今在距首里城要塞二十碼之地點，該城城壁厚五英尺，美軍之十六英寸砲彈亦不能人，冲繩西端日軍仍守棒砂糖高地。</p>
<p>冲繩航空　作戰動向</p>
<p>前綫基地二十五日中央社電　冲繩方面航空作戰之動向，漸次由協力陸上戰鬥，而轉變爲攻擊後方海域之模樣，航空作戰突入新局面，頗値注目。緣敵機對冲繩本島之攻擊，較之本月初句，一日累計約七百架時，規模漸次縮小，近數日來，殆無本格化之來襲，然其攻擊兵力，似已傾注於奄美羣島方面。揆察二十二日畫問間百七十架之運襲及是日午後戰鬥轟炸機五十架編隊來襲之事實，則可窺知敵空軍攻擊之目標，此雖因氣候關係，然一方因感機數不足，於協力陸上戰鬥前，攻擊日方補給路，以使戰勢好轉，除此別無良策。十五日止估計敵機數，在北飛行塲有小型機一百三十二架，大型機二十八架，其中有運鹼機及B29型機若干架，中型九架，中飛行塲有小型機十餘架，伊江飛機塲有小型七八十架，主爲P51型機，共計約三百架，故今後敵機動部隊之動向及敵航空部隊之新意向，頗須嚴戒。</p>
<p>日報分析　敵軍意圖　　東京二十五央社電日讀賣報知新聞報宮本特派員，頃就冲繩前綫基地敵軍此後之動向，予以分析觀察，謂此好機不可坐失，其要旨如次：冲繩決戰已歷兩月，校硫黃島之一個月，敵已費其兩倍力量，戰局之前途尚不可測，敵爲打破此種戰局，必將展開積極攻勢，戰局之轉機，厥賴新的補給力量，敵經過兩個月之久，日前始獲得新兵力增後。敵機動部隊勢力，刻已接近達九州僅需飛機二十分行程之地點，擁有正式空母四艘，巡艦改設空母二艘，戰艦六艘，巡洋艦二十艘，驅逐艦二十二艘之堅强勢力，擬一舉打破冲繩決戰力之均衡狀態，掌糧絕對之制空權，以鞏固冲繩之地步。分析敵之意圖，有下列兩點點：　爲分散集結於冲繩一帶之日軍攻擊力，另在其他地點登陸作戰，　以增强冲繩爲第一要着，企圖直接打擊日特攻隊及其後方是也。現在冲繩水域之敵勢力，除輸送船以外，約有一二○艘，包括航空母艦十一艘，戰艦十三艘，其兵力配置及攻擊方法，由最近冲繩四周之敵狀判斷，預料敵將採用上述之二法，傾力前進。所謂敵之新登陸企岡，地點當在接近冲繩之小島，但敵現有十三萬餘兵力被牽制在冲繩本島，故新登陸作戰至爲困難。又此次敵機動部隊之來襲，在列島之南北方同時行之，其攻擊日標殆爲日方之飛行基地及迎擊戰鬥機。又敵在冲繩本島附近另集結戰艦五至六艘，巡洋艦八至十艘，驅隊艦四十艘，故敵方如欲作新登陸企圖，母寗將此强大勢力之艦隊集合在冲繩本島爲上策也。</p>
<h3>木村少尉　授予感狀　日陸軍發表</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電日陸軍省二十四日發表，本年三月二十七夜，B29型敵機侵入北九州，陸軍少尉木村守光予以邀擊，於短時間內述續擊落敵機六架，此次特授予感狀，並奏呈天皇。</p>
<h3>培里琉泰拉干　日軍勇戰中　呂宋巴列特山地激戰</h3>
<p>前綫基地二十五日中央社電　於帛勞諸島及培里琉島方面之日將兵，依然敢鬥中，尤以培里琉島北部，於四月初句即閒始作戰，自四月十四日，擊毀唱潛艇三艘，小型艦艇十五艘，殺傷敵軍九百二十名以上。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十五日中央社電泰拉千島敵軍，二十一日以來於全綫反覆施以艦砲射擊及飛機轟炸，尤以飛機塲東北及净水池東北，兩軍展開死戰，最爲熾烈。日軍守備部隊阻止敵眾前進，二十一·二兩日，日軍藉砲火掩護，敢行奇襲飛機塲及敵軍陣地，殺傷人員一百五十餘名，炸毀幕舍七所，載重車五輛，使敵軍陷於混亂狀態。</p>
<p>非島前綫基地二十五日由央社電菲島方面日守備部隊，依然與優勢之敵軍繼續激戰中，現敵在呂宋島之勢力達十師至十一師，以其主力約六師舞向呂宋北部方面。該方面日軍部隊自碧瑤撤退以來，利用險峻地勢及暴雨之惡劣氣候，到處展開積極攻擊，同時連續實施奇裝攻擊，予敵重創。敵以一部兵力最近來攻巴列特山地，日軍部隊亦作猛烈反攻。又敵在呂宋島之航空兵力，以克拉克地區爲中心，合仁牙因方面約有飛機一千又五十架。</p>
<h3>祈念奮進必勝</h3>
<p>— 日駐華艦隊報導部長松島大佐</p>
<p>當茲最劇烈之決戰期間，今日迎第四十屈海軍紀念日，緬懷過去四十年來日本海軍發展之行跡，及先輩將兵所遣之彪炳功動，更念及現在大東亞戰爭日海軍之奮戰，誠覺感慨無量。</p>
<p>現在大東亞決戰以冲繩作中心點，兩軍展開白熱之塵戰，其歸趨與此後戰爭之運命，具有重大關係，爲世界一致注視。我陸海軍航空部隊及水上部隊，刻猛烈攻擊集合於該島四週之敵機動部隊及艦備及將兵之勇戰，戰減敵登陸軍之大部，敵已氣習奄奄，僅　海上部隊之砲擊及航空機之援助，堅守已獲陣地，幷企圖向前深入。但觀於馬里亞納菲律賓方面敵兵力之動靜，及敵航空部隊之窺　日本本土方面。故今後作戰之進展，實須充分警戒。</p>
<p>又歐洲戰局結束以後，敵英美已逐漸將其兵力集合於太平洋方面，國內外情勢對於日本之前途，已遭逢歷史所未有之難關。誠然，我帝國政府決儼然站在大東亞戰爭之立塲，澈底爲貫澈天東亞自衛聖戰而邁進，此點業由鈴本首相以攻軍當局聲明在前矣。敵集結其陸海空全力，以包圍日本，藉其豐富之物資數量，企圖一舉戰滅日本，但我抱發塲神州正氣之精神，現全國一體，秉其特攻精神，傾注一切心力，以與驕敵堂堂決一雌雄。我等之前途，固尚橫亘幾多難局，現一億國民以日章旗爲中心，舉此御旗共同作戰，共同前進。過去四十年來，帝國海軍建立烈烈之傳統與不屈之鬥魂，際此日本臨興亡歧路之秋，決發揚光輝，用降魔之利劍，揮舞敵人之頭上，此爲我海軍之精神。於此生死一如之信念下，抱滅敵之熱烈意氣，爲貫澈其本分及必成之悠久使命而一意直進也。</p>
<p>今値光輝之海軍紀念日，銘記聖將東鄉元帥之名訓：「敵由海上來者於海上防之」一語。回憶帝國海軍　昔之精神，深信將來之前途益增光輝，士氣益加　厲奮發，幷衷心祈念奪進必勝也。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>東鄕戰術與近代海戰</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>——五月二十五日在上海廣播電台演詞</p>
<p>第四十次日本海軍節快來臨了。在這大東亞戰爭決戰的現階段，我們更不能不想起四十年前爲我們東亞民族揚眉吐氣的日本海海戰的一幕。</p>
<p>四十年前的五月二十七日，日本與帝我雙方的艦隊相過於對馬海峽東方，展開激戰，結果日本聯合艦隊一舉擊破帝俄波羅的海艦隊，獲得大勝，終於奠定了日俄戰爭最後勝利的基　。這戰役，史稱爲「日本海海戰」，實爲海上決戰的典型。其特點，即爲東鄉元帥的作戰計劃非常周密，恰與「特拉法爾迦海戰」時英國名將納爾遜的戰法相反。當時，東鄉元帥指揮下的日本聯合艦隊，爲澈底殲滅波羅的海艦隊起見，預定於四畫夜之間完成全部作戰計劃，將濟州島附近至海參崴爲止的六百海浬的海戰鬥，第一，第二兩段計劃，因天氣惡劣，未克實行，所以傎正的會戰是從第三段開始的，順次向第四，第五兩階段進展，而第六段與第七段則因戰鬥的結束較預料爲早，已無實施的必要。日俄艦隊會戰時，東鄉元帥採取所謂「敵前回轉」的戰法，將帝俄艦隊迎頭痛擊，在砲戰閒始以後的三十五分鐘之內，即已決定兩軍的勝負了。</p>
<p>海戰與陸戰不同，作戰時沒有山川·森林等地形的影響，而以廣大的海面爲舞台，除受氣象的限制以外，行動比較自由。然在浩瀚的海上搜索敵蹤，頗爲不易，尤其在飛機尙未發達的當時，艦隊指揮官的優劣，艦艇性能的良否，以及人員訓練之是否嚴格，砲術之是否精確等等，史有決定海戰勝負的作用。例如日本海海戰時，波羅的海艦隊司令洛傑斯托恩斯基所用的戰法，即仿效納爾遜在「特拉法爾迦海單」中的行動，而東鄉元帥的戰法雖似當寺曾遭慘敗的法國艦隊的戰法，然而充分發軍了壓制敵軍前鋒的妙用。因此，日本聯合艦隊所受的損失，也遠比當時的英國海軍爲小，其原因誠如日本秋山中佐所說：「艦船兵器的進步固屬原因之一，然而日本海軍的士氣與砲戰的按術，遠較敵軍優越，實爲戰勝的最大原因。而且從戰略上推論，東鄉大將的計劃也比納爾遜爲周密爲優越。」</p>
<p>日俄艦隊的海上決戰，所以成爲結束日俄戰爭大局的主要原因，是在當時任何國家的治軍皆採取現役精兵主義，預備兵力甚少。加以戰艦·巡洋艦的建造，頗費時日，一度在海戰中遭受殲滅之後，便難立刻重整旗鼓。沮就是海上決戰的勝敗得以支配全局的理由。</p>
<p>但時至今日，近代海戰在本質上已經發生變化，因爲飛機的進步，海軍的戰術已面目一新，大非昔比。飛機不僅是艦隊的耳目，且爲其海戰之前哨。例如夏威夾海戰，就是一個最好的例十。他如馬來洋面海戰，台灣海面空戰，菲律賓東方海空戰等等‘以及日軍神風特攻機隊在雷伊泰，冲繩島等處所建的偉大戰果，均可證實空軍在海戰中的重要。自從夏成夷海戰以來，敵美即致力於航空母艦及飛機的生產，其原因亦在於此。可是，敵美雖有不少的航空母艦及飛戰，但由於太平洋的遼闊浩瀚，要想接近日本，便不得不採取所謂「跳島作戰」，憑其物質數量，不惜犧牲，冒險進攻。回顧自共發動所謂太平洋反攻以還，在日本陸海空軍的協力迎擊之下，喪失的艦艇，飛機，人員，物資，已不可計數。僅就冲繩島方面而言，自三月二十三日至五月十日晨止，僅僅一個半月間，據日本大本營發表，爲日軍擊沉擊毀的艦船，即達五百十五艘之多。</p>
<p>據軍事專家的觀測，越近日本內綫防衛地帶，所遇困難就越大，所受損失亦越多，這是敵美自己早就知道的，而在現實的戰鬥上也已得到事實的證明。試觀敵美侵入琉球羣島迄今。歷時業已六旬，猶未脫出苦戰的境地，距其原來的目標尙遠，考其原因，不外乎補給困難，增援不易，以及日軍反擊力的堅強，尤其是日軍航空部隊的活躍，更使其痛受打擊。因爲日本本土就是一大航空要塞，在此基地空軍的勢力圈內，敵軍的作戰當然十分很難。</p>
<p>目前的大東亞戰爭是決定日本與大東亞民族存亡之戰，以日本海軍過去的光榮歷史以及日軍士氣之激昂，益以最後的決戰須於日本的內海進行，是故敵美之將遭致命的打擊，乃是意料中事。</p>
<p>海戰的戰術戰備今昔雖有不同，而日本海軍的勇敢精神，今昔則一。欣逢第四十次日本海軍紀念日，我們回顧旣往光榮的勝利史，同時更應堅定大東亞戰爭的必勝信念。</p>
<h3>美旗艦一艘　受傷修理中</h3>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電　華盛頓來電，美海軍部二十四日發表稱：於大東亞戰爭序幕戰中，被日本海軍部隊擊沉之前美東亞艦隊旗艦赫斯頓號之代艦，於婆羅洲附近海面。曾中魚雷二發，蒙受大損害，直駛紐約市布魯克林海軍工塲，施行修理中。被創之時日則未發表</p>

<p>市宜傳處主持之第十八次記者例會，於昨（廿五）日上午十時牛，在巿府會議室舉行，由警察局消防處長發表全市消防設施情形。</p>
<p>一般工作</p>
<p>消防計劃，分戰時及平時兩方面，平時對於消防工作，大致爲每一分署管轄地區，必須　調查該地水量及地勢。　調查各分署管轄內，每一戶或倉庫所　之危險品，或易於一爆發之物件　一旦發生火災，各分署接獲報告，在警鈴響後，三十秒鏡內出動，五分鐘內抵達火塲；如黃浦江內船舶發生火災，本處立即協力水上消防隊施救，萬一在出事處，深感出水壓力不足，可電水電公司增加水量，電力公司每日亦派員在各分署　値。</p>
<p>防空消防</p>
<p>關於防空消防，消防處為適應需要起見，特將全體隊員，另編防空消防部隊。惟各區消防分署在平時獲得火警時，立即出動，倘在防空時，須聽取處長之命令方可出動，蓋以現有人力及設備，應付空襲時之火災尚感困難，爲求充分利用計，不得不採取重點主義，見機應　，冀以有限之能力，應付萬急之塲合。同時爲預防水源發生阻碍，特籌劃　水池之設備，及調查利用河水。目前蓄水池完工者共有十處，今後在全市計　建築七十四處，此外如交通斷絕，則以自由車應變。預防煤氣破壞措置，現正訓練員工，導以適當方法，俾資應付。</p>
<p>取締敲詐</p>
<p>消防人員如有不法行為，決嚴予取締，過去曾發現少數不肖人員，業加拘捕嚴處，不日即可判決。同時希望市民澈底瞭解：　發生火災時消防費用，悉爲政府負捐，市民毋須出費。　不論火警任何性質，決無罰款。　赴火塲調查職員均有身份證，市民可隨時索閱，如發現冒充或有敲詐情事，請即密吿。　消防處絕不派人向外兜售消防用具，如有發現，即為冒充消防員。　在發生火災時，巿民亦不可賄賂。</p>
<h3>申請調整售價　應塡標準表</h3>
<p>市經濟局以各業公會或廠商呈請調整限價，所送成本表式樣既不一致，計算又欠週詳，不特審查費時，抑且修訂售價難期準確。茲爲便利審核幷劃一式樣起見，業經呈奉市政府核準，印製標準成本計算表三種，分別適用於製造輸入及供應三類。昨特令飭各廠商自即日起凡申請調整售價，應一律向該局第五科索取表格，依式塡具，幷檢附各項有關證件，一併呈送，以憑審核。</p>
<h3>防空本部聯絡善團參加救濟工作　減少空襲損害維護安全</h3>

<p>（又訊）本市發給各區棚戶之綜合配給證手續，向由市警察局保甲處代辦，嗣物配處方面有將自辦之議，適因第三十一期至六十期配給證已發，不及趕辦，故改由六十一期自辦，六十一期至九十期之綜合配給證，即將發給，經物配處擬訂各區棚戶調查戶口及登記發證辦法，送請保甲處予以協助，頃由該處通令所屬總聯保及各區辦事處，一體協助</p>

<h3>蘇省糧食增產</h3>
<p>— 湯毅</p>
<p>任省長談農貸</p>
<p>「江蘇土地肥沃，向爲產米之區，這幾年來，不論對戰力，對民食，都有鉅大的貢獻，因此，江蘇省農民所負的任務，異常重大，擔負也特別沉重。怎樣儘可能使日趨凋敝的農村，透過一口氣來，不僅是蘇省官民應盡的表務，由於相互間關係的密切，食糧的供給，鄰近省市，也非常關懷。」當記者二十一日訪問任援道省長時，任省長對最近米價的突趨升泓，影響民生，極爲重　，發表了如上的意見。</p>
<p>「因爲去年一部分田畝歉收，又以其他種種關係，農民顯然缺乏再生產的資金，　希望今後　充分的　食供應，要米價不再高漲，唯有代農民解決當前的困難，使今年稻作順利耕　，達到增產實效。</p>
<p>「上海巿有　人士有鑒於此，自動發起蘇省農貸運動，本人代蘇省農民表示深切的感謝。此次農貸籌措總額，有五十萬萬元，就數字上看，可說極大，以蘇省面積之廣，農民需要之多，雖然不能說足够，不過就算他杯水車薪，總受了杯水之益，對於培養與恢復農村元氣，極有裨益。不僅是目前的需要，就國家永遠之計來看，影響也很重大。</p>
<p>「姑且不談農貸本身的作用，僅以上海有餘的資金，移至農村，對於上海物價的穩定，也頗有關係，此其一；第二，上海領導分子興有資產的人，能捨小我，而就大我，能不以一時之利疏忽了久遠之計，這種目光與精神，値得佩服，這種風尚的轉移，更可說是國家復興的曙光。」</p>
<p>省府增產工作</p>
<p>江蘇省政府不僅希望農貸能在最短期內實施，實際上已從各方而着手增加糧食生產。據記者觀察所得，主要的有下列數點：</p>
<p>蘇嘉鐵路自折毀後，省府已向鐵路公司方面，把荒廢的路基，全部租用，分配給沿綫的農民耕種，總計增加的農田，有四千八百畝，由省府出種籽肥料農具，由承種農民出人力，其收穫按照四六分配。省府目的在增產而不在營利，所以不計盈虧。聞領地的農民，非常踴躍，今年秋收，收效必宏。</p>
<p>省建設廳下設有農業增產策進委會及農林漁收增產督導處。主要工作爲訓練技術人才，介紹優良種籽及獎勵墾荒三項。在吳縣設有稻作試騐塲，松江設有分塲；在崑山正　設有漁收試騐塲。此外又推進冬季除螟，保護耕半，改良　桑，獎勵農村副業諸運動。</p>
<p>省建設廳已會同新運會，靑少年團及保甲街坊組織，調查省垣及各縣隙地，籌設示範農塲。如私人有花　兩所者，規定應以一所用於增產糧食；又如學校操塲之四週，也利用於種植上面。不論面積大小，總期集腋成表，化零爲整。</p>
<p>任援道氏於去年十一月十日就任蘇省長後，首即揭　「建設生產」爲施政重點。孫育才建設廳長在任省長領導下，周詻博訪，多所興革。孫應長所提出的口號：「建設工程，經濟施策、務　戰時之需要；加强增產，開發資源，期臻民生之繁榮。」這正是一個良好的建設應長的座右銘呢！</p>
<h3>介紹現代日本文化展覽會</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>現代日本文化展覽會爲國際文化振興會主辦，由本報贊助，已於昨日在南京路二一二號大可樂樓上「上海畫廊」舉行。</p>
<p>「文化旣不是享樂的東西，也不是單指文學音樂等藝術而言。一國國民努力實踐的精神，就是文化的最高表現。」</p>
<p>照這廣義的理念，展覽會中陳列的照片，可說就是日本保衛東方文化，培養東方文化的種種情景。</p>
<p>展覽照片的性質，範圍很廣，可分六部分：</p>
<p>海陸空軍的精稅。</p>
<p>軍需工業：有飛機，　鐵工業，發電所，汽車工廠，造船業，戰車工業，工員生活等。</p>
<p>敎育：有關於國民學校，科學敎育，電影敎育及中等學校。女學校，高等專門學校，高等商船學校的敎育狀况等。</p>
<p>體育；有游泳，滑翔機，柔道，劍道，弓道，球戲，馬術，自行軍集團，軍事敎練，學生航空等。</p>
<p>社會施設：有電光新聞之戰果報告，地下鐵道等。</p>
<p>美術工藝</p>
<p>全部共六十八件，會期自二十五日起至三十日止。時間每日上午十時至午後五時，不收門票，歡迎各界參觀。</p>
<p>短評　緊急措置</p>
<p>最近物價以在飛躍上漲，尤其是米價的狂跳，令人咋舌，而漲風之狂，尤為前所未見。試想平民生活早已壓得喘不過氣，今復遭此火上之油，無異宣告平民之死刑，怎不令人怨尤！</p>
<p>戰時物價上漲，在經濟的觀點，原為不可避免之必然現象。不過，雖云必然上漲，也應有合理的程度。超越合理程度的上漲，必非經濟上的原因元疑。換言之，狂與暴的上漲，完全由於抽機與操縱，因此，根據擒賊須擒王，斬草先除根的法則，必須用澈底和嚴厲的手段，消滅投機與操縱的禍根，才能奏效。惟有强有力的政治手段，才是擒賊王斬草根的實力。最低限度，在運用經濟手段抑平物價時，必須同時配合政治手段，尤須澈底和嚴厲去執行。</p>
<p>徒然怨尤，於事無補的，我們很沉痛地盼望當局重視的，爲維擊大多數市民的信仰，對於物價的狂暴上漲，應速籌緊急措置，深信賢明當局決不漠視吧</p>

Since the enemy landed on the island, ground combat has lasted for five weeks. During this time, the Japanese garrison has met the enemy's attacks and maintained the northern defense line of Shuri. Since the 24th, the enemy has added new elite forces, fiercely covering their advance, but the Japanese defenders have not yielded an inch and bravely counterattacked, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Understanding the timing and location, after successfully infiltrating the northern and central airfields, they used the bombs they carried to destroy enemy aircraft, military supply warehouses, and airfield facilities at the airfields. The enemy airfield garrison was thrown into great confusion, and they are currently continuing to expand their gains. Prior to the Heroic Paratrooper Unit's surprise attack, the Japanese air fleet launched a large-scale attack on the northern and central airfields, as well as the Ie Island airfield. The Heroic Unit took advantage of this opportunity to daringly land. Therefore, although both locations attempted to flee to aircraft carriers, most were buried on the ground or in the sea. Due to the special attack operations from both land and sea, the enemy camp suffered a tremendous blow. The Japanese garrison in the northern area of Naha's Shuri district, seeing the heroic fighting of the Heroic Paratrooper Unit and the special attack units, had their morale boosted even higher.</p>
<h3>Large Pillars of Fire Erupt Repeatedly on the Waters off Kadena and Kerama: Japanese Special Attack Flying Units Launch Fierce Attacks</h3>
<p>Southwestern Islands Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese special attack units and air force units attacked enemy warships and airfields around Okinawa on the 24th. Two large explosions and several large fires occurred at the northern airfield on Okinawa Island. The detailed battle results of the attacks on warships have not yet been determined. On the waters off Kadena and in the Kerama Islands, nineteen large pillars of fire were identified. Japanese military units continued to attack from the 24th to the morning of the 25th. In addition, from the night of the 23rd to around 3:00 AM on the 24th, two vessels of unknown type were identified on fire in the sea northwest of Naha.</p>
<p>Japanese Garrison: Outnumbered and Facing a Strong Enemy</p>
<p>Southern Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 21st and 22nd, the enemy forces on Okinawa Island, who resumed their regular offensive, deployed a number of tanks and approximately three thousand soldiers on the front line to forcibly approach the main Japanese defense positions. The officers and soldiers of the Japanese garrison, outnumbered and facing a strong enemy, shattered the enemy's attacks in various places and prevented their intrusion. Currently, the confrontation line between the Japanese and American forces is along the lines of Yuntamumori, Mount Yuza, Ishimine, Ona, Hirara-cho near Shuri, Mount Go-nana, the south side of Gushichan, and Shuri. The enemy's offensive focus is placed on the flat coastal area directly facing Yuntamumori and the areas of Nishihara, Oma, and Iri west of Okinawa, launching concentrated attacks. On the morning of the 23rd, approximately 500 enemy soldiers, deploying over ten tanks, invaded Yonabaru on the southern coast of Yuntamumori and are currently engaged in combat with Japanese forces there.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report - According to a New York broadcast, New York Times reporter Roth, who is serving with the military in the Ryukyu Islands, reported to the newspaper, stating that the U.S. First Division is now twenty yards from the Shuri Castle fortress. The castle walls are five feet thick, and even the U.S. military's sixteen-inch shells cannot penetrate them. Japanese forces on the western end of Okinawa still hold Sugar Loaf Hill.</p>
<p>Okinawa Air Operations: Combat Trends</p>
<p>Frontline Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The trends in air operations in the Okinawa area are gradually shifting from cooperating with ground combat to attacking the rear sea areas. Air operations are entering a new phase, which is worthy of attention. The enemy aircraft attacks on Okinawa Island, compared to the beginning of this month, when the daily total reached approximately 700 aircraft, have gradually decreased in scale. In recent days, there have been almost no full-scale attacks. However, their attack force seems to have been focused on the Amami Islands. Observing the fact that 170 aircraft attacked during the day on the 22nd and that a formation of 50 fighter-bombers attacked in the afternoon of the same day, one can discern the enemy air force's target. Although this is due to weather conditions, on the one hand, because they feel there are insufficient aircraft, they are attacking the Japanese supply route before cooperating with ground combat to improve the situation. Other than this, there is no better strategy. As of the 15th, the estimated number of enemy aircraft is 132 small aircraft and 28 large aircraft at the northern airfield, including some transport aircraft and B29 aircraft, nine medium-sized aircraft, over ten small aircraft at the central airfield, and seventy to eighty small aircraft, mainly P51 aircraft, at the Ie Island airfield, totaling approximately 300 aircraft. Therefore, the future movements of the enemy's mobile units and the new intentions of the enemy air force must be strictly guarded against.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Analyzes: Enemy Intentions</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun correspondent Miyamoto recently analyzed and observed the future movements of the enemy forces at the Okinawa front line base, stating that this good opportunity should not be missed. The main points are as follows: The decisive battle for Okinawa has lasted for two months, twice as long as the one month on Iwo Jima. The enemy has spent twice the effort, and the future of the battle is still unpredictable. In order to break this battle situation, the enemy will definitely launch an active offensive. The turning point of the battle depends on new supply power. After two months, the enemy has finally obtained new reinforcements. The enemy's mobile unit strength is now approaching Kyushu, a mere 20 minutes flight away, possessing a strong force of four formal aircraft carriers, two converted aircraft carrier cruisers, six battleships, twenty cruisers, and twenty-two destroyers, intending to break the balance of power in the Okinawa decisive battle in one fell swoop, seize absolute air supremacy, and consolidate their foothold in Okinawa. Analyzing the enemy's intentions, there are the following two points: In order to disperse the attacking power of the Japanese forces gathered around Okinawa, they will launch landing operations in other locations; To strengthen Okinawa as the top priority, attempting to directly strike the Japanese special attack units and their rear is the goal. Currently, the enemy force in the waters off Okinawa, excluding transport ships, is approximately 120 vessels, including 11 aircraft carriers and 13 battleships. Judging from the recent enemy situation around Okinawa, it is predicted that the enemy will adopt the above two methods, pouring all their strength forward. The so-called new landing attempt by the enemy will be at a small island close to Okinawa, but the enemy currently has over 130,000 troops tied down on Okinawa Island, so a new landing operation is extremely difficult. Also, this time the enemy's mobile unit attack will be carried out simultaneously in the north and south of the archipelago. The target of their attack is probably the Japanese air bases and intercepting fighter planes. In addition, the enemy has gathered five to six battleships, eight to ten cruisers, and forty destroyer fleets near Okinawa Island. Therefore, if the enemy intends to make a new landing attempt, it would be best to concentrate this powerful fleet on Okinawa Island.</p>
<h3>Second Lieutenant Kimura Awarded Commendation: Japanese Army Announces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 24th that on the night of March 27th of this year, when B29 enemy aircraft invaded northern Kyushu, Army Second Lieutenant Morimitsu Kimura intercepted them and successively shot down six enemy aircraft in a short period of time. This time, he was specially awarded a commendation and presented to the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Peleliu and Terakan: Japanese Forces Fighting Bravely; Fierce Battles in the Balete Pass in Luzon</h3>
<p>Frontline Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese soldiers and officers in the Palau Islands and Peleliu Island areas are still fighting bravely, especially in the northern part of Peleliu Island, where operations began in early April. Since April 14th, they have sunk or destroyed three submarines and fifteen small vessels, killing or wounding over 920 enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the 21st, enemy forces on Terakan Island have repeatedly subjected the entire line to naval gun fire and aerial bombing, especially northeast of the airfield and northeast of the water purification pond, where the two armies have engaged in mortal combat, which has been the fiercest. Japanese garrison forces have prevented the enemy from advancing. On the 21st and 22nd, under the cover of artillery fire, Japanese forces daringly launched surprise attacks on the airfield and enemy positions, killing or wounding over 150 personnel, destroying seven barracks and five trucks, throwing the enemy forces into confusion.</p>
<p>No Island Frontline Base, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese garrison forces on the Philippine Islands are still continuing to fight fiercely with superior enemy forces. Currently, the enemy's strength on Luzon Island has reached ten to eleven divisions, with its main force of approximately six divisions moving towards the northern part of Luzon. Since the Japanese military units in that area withdrew from Baguio, they have been taking advantage of the steep terrain and the harsh weather of heavy rain, launching active attacks everywhere. At the same time, they have been continuously implementing surprise attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Recently, the enemy has attacked the Balete Pass with a portion of its forces, and Japanese military units have also launched fierce counterattacks. Also, the enemy's air power on Luzon Island, centered in the Clark area, together with the Lingayen area, has approximately 1,050 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Pray for Determined Progress to Certain Victory</h3>
<p>— Japanese Navy Fleet Reporting Department Chief, Colonel Matsushima</p>
<p>During this most intense decisive battle period, today we welcome the 40th anniversary of the Navy Day. Reflecting on the traces of the Japanese Navy's development over the past forty years and the outstanding achievements left behind by the senior officers and soldiers, and further contemplating the fierce battles of the Japanese Navy in the Greater East Asia War, I truly feel immeasurable emotion.</p>
<p>Currently, the decisive battle in Greater East Asia is centered on Okinawa, where the two armies are engaged in heated battle. Its direction and the fate of the war thereafter are of great importance and are being watched intently by the world. Our army, navy, air force, and surface forces are fiercely attacking the enemy mobile units and vessels gathered around the island, and the brave fighting of the soldiers is greatly reducing the enemy's landing forces. The enemy is already on its last breath, relying solely on the naval bombardment and air support to defend their acquired positions and attempting to advance further. However, looking at the movements of the enemy forces in the Mariana and Philippine areas and the enemy air force's attempts to invade the Japanese mainland, we must fully guard against future operational developments.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the end of the European war, the enemy, Britain and the United States, have gradually gathered their forces in the Pacific area. The domestic and international situation has faced Japan with unprecedented difficulties in its history. Indeed, our Imperial government has resolved to stand firmly in the Greater East Asia War and thoroughly advance for the sake of the Greater East Asia Self-Defense Holy War. This point has already been declared in advance by Prime Minister Suzuki and the military authorities. The enemy is gathering all its land, sea, and air power to encircle Japan and, with its abundant resources, attempting to destroy Japan in one fell swoop. However, embracing the spirit of the Divine Land, the entire nation is united, upholding the special attack spirit, and pouring all our energy to bravely decide the outcome against the arrogant enemy. Our future still holds many difficulties, but the hundred million people, with the Japanese flag at the center, will raise this sacred banner and fight together and advance together. Over the past forty years, the Imperial Navy has established a glorious tradition and an indomitable fighting spirit. At this time when Japan faces a crossroads of survival, we will definitely display its brilliance, wield the demon-slaying sword, and swing it over the enemy's head. This is the spirit of our navy. Under the belief that life and death are one, embracing the fervent will to destroy the enemy, we will single-mindedly advance to complete our duty and the lasting mission that must be accomplished.</p>
<p>Today, on this glorious Navy Day, we remember the teachings of the great General Togo: "Defend against those who come from the sea at sea." Recalling the past spirit of the Imperial Navy, we deeply believe that the future will be even more glorious, morale will be even more boosted, and we wholeheartedly pray for determined progress to certain victory.</p>
<p>Commentary:</p>
<h3>Togo's Tactics and Modern Naval Warfare</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>——Speech given at the Shanghai Radio Station on May 25th</p>
<p>The 40th Japanese Navy Day is approaching. At this current stage of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we cannot help but recall the scene of the Battle of Tsushima forty years ago, which raised the eyebrows of our East Asian nations.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, on May 27th, the Japanese and Russian fleets encountered each other east of the Tsushima Strait and engaged in fierce battle. As a result, the Japanese Combined Fleet decisively defeated the Russian Baltic Fleet, achieving a great victory and finally laying the foundation for the ultimate victory of the Russo-Japanese War. This battle, historically known as the "Battle of Tsushima," is a classic example of a decisive naval battle. Its characteristic is that Admiral Togo's operational plan was very meticulous, exactly the opposite of the tactics of British general Nelson at the "Battle of Trafalgar." At that time, in order to thoroughly annihilate the Baltic Fleet, the Japanese Combined Fleet under Admiral Togo planned to complete the entire operational plan between four periods of the day, dividing the 600 nautical miles of naval combat from the vicinity of Jeju Island to Vladivostok into the first and second phases of the plan. However, due to bad weather, they were not able to carry out these plans. Therefore, the true battle began from the third phase, progressing sequentially to the fourth and fifth phases, while the sixth and seventh phases were no longer necessary because the battle ended earlier than expected. During the battle between the Japanese and Russian fleets, Admiral Togo adopted the so-called "enemy front turn" tactic, striking the Russian fleet head-on. Within thirty-five minutes of the start of the gun battle, the outcome of the battle between the two armies had already been decided.</p>
<p>Naval warfare is different from land warfare. In operations, there is no influence of terrain such as mountains, rivers, or forests, and the vast sea is the stage. Except for limitations imposed by weather, actions are relatively free. However, it is quite difficult to search for the enemy's whereabouts in the vast sea, especially at that time when aircraft had not yet been developed. The quality of the fleet commander, the quality of the performance of the ships, and the strictness of personnel training, as well as the precision of gunnery, etc., all had a decisive effect on the victory or defeat of the naval battle. For example, in the Battle of Tsushima, the tactics used by the commander of the Baltic Fleet, Rozhestvensky, imitated Nelson's actions in the "Battle of Trafalgar," while Admiral Togo's tactics, although similar to those of the French fleet that suffered a disastrous defeat at that time, fully demonstrated the subtle effect of suppressing the enemy's vanguard. Therefore, the losses suffered by the Japanese Combined Fleet were also far smaller than those of the British Navy at that time. The reason for this is, as Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama said: "The progress of naval vessel weaponry is certainly one reason, but the morale and gunnery skills of the Japanese Navy were far superior to those of the enemy army. This was the greatest reason for the victory. Moreover, from a strategic point of view, Admiral Togo's plan was more meticulous and superior to Nelson's."</p>
<p>The naval decisive battle between the Japanese and Russian fleets became the main reason for ending the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War because at that time, all countries adopted a standing army elite soldier doctrine, with very few reserve forces. In addition, the construction of battleships and cruisers took a lot of time. Once annihilated in a naval battle, it was difficult to immediately reorganize. This is the reason why the victory or defeat of a naval decisive battle could dominate the overall situation.</p>
<p>But today, modern naval warfare has changed in nature, because of the progress of aircraft, naval tactics have taken on a new look, which is very different from the past. Aircraft are not only the eyes and ears of the fleet, but also the vanguard of naval warfare. For example, the Pearl Harbor naval battle is a prime example. Other examples include the naval battle in the Malayan waters, the aerial battle over the Taiwan Strait, the aerial naval battle east of the Philippines, etc., as well as the great battle achievements of the Japanese Kamikaze special attack squadron at Leyte and Okinawa Island, all of which can prove the importance of air force in naval warfare. Since the Pearl Harbor naval battle, the enemy America has devoted itself to the production of aircraft carriers and aircraft, and the reason for this is also here. However, although the enemy America has many aircraft carriers and fighter planes, due to the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, in order to get close to Japan, it has had to adopt the so-called "island hopping operation," relying on its material quantity, not hesitating to make sacrifices, and risking an offensive. Looking back since the common launch of the so-called Pacific counteroffensive, under the cooperative counterattack of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the ships, aircraft, personnel, and materials lost have been countless. Taking only the Okinawa Island area as an example, from March 23rd to the morning of May 10th, in just one and a half months, according to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, the number of ships sunk or destroyed by the Japanese military reached as many as 515.</p>
<p>According to the observation of military experts, the closer one gets to Japan's inner defense zone, the greater the difficulties encountered and the greater the losses suffered. This is something that the enemy America knew long ago, and it has already been proven by actual combat. Looking at the fact that the enemy America's invasion of the Ryukyu Islands has lasted for sixty days, and it has not yet escaped the hardship of battle and is still far from its original goal, the reasons are nothing more than difficulty in supply, difficulty in reinforcement, and the strength of the Japanese military's counterattack, especially the activity of the Japanese air force, which has caused it to suffer painfully. Because the Japanese mainland is a large air fortress, in this air force sphere of influence, the enemy's operations are certainly very difficult.</p>
<p>The current Greater East Asia War is a battle that will determine the survival of Japan and the East Asian nations. With the glorious history of the Japanese Navy in the past and the intense morale of the Japanese military, and with the final decisive battle taking place in Japan's inland sea, it is expected that the enemy America will suffer a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Although the tactics and preparations for naval warfare are different now than in the past, the brave spirit of the Japanese Navy is the same now as in the past. On the occasion of the 40th Japanese Navy Day, we review the glorious history of past victories, and at the same time, we must strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>One U.S. Flagship Undergoing Repairs Due to Damage</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from Washington states that the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 24th: The replacement for the former flagship of the U.S. East Asia Fleet, the Houston, which was sunk by Japanese naval forces in the prelude to the Greater East Asia War, suffered severe damage after being struck by two torpedoes off the coast of Borneo and sailed directly to the Brooklyn Naval Yard in New York City for repairs.

<h3>Japan Aviation Industry Association Establishes Comprehensive Deliberation Room</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japan Aviation Industry Association, in light of the fact that the outcome of the decisive battle depends entirely on the success or failure of aircraft production, has established a Comprehensive Deliberation Room to deliberate on various methods to enhance the combat power of aircraft.</p>
<h3>Revision of the Trusteeship System Articles</h3>
<p>Passed at the San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - San Francisco News: The Trusteeship Committee of the San Francisco Conference passed four standard documents in the chapter on the international charter on trusteeship on the night of the 23rd, with slight revisions. The trusteeship system applies to the territories currently under trusteeship, the territories seized from enemy countries, and other territories voluntarily subjected to trusteeship. All trusteeship issues must be resolved with the consent of the directly related countries. Any country in the United Nations that holds territory under trusteeship must agree to the trusteeship agreement. If there is no agreement on the trusteeship agreement, this chapter shall not change or interpret the rights of the people or countries of any territory or the conditions of the trusteeship. The trusteeship agreement may designate strategic bases, sometimes including applying them to part or all of the territory covered by the agreement. Agreements on strategic bases shall not prejudice any decisions made by the World Security Organization established to fulfill its responsibility for maintaining peace. Among the above regulations, it is noteworthy that the Soviet Union's proposed amendment that "strategic bases shall be designated by the Security Council" was ultimately withdrawn. The biggest obstacle in the trusteeship regulations, the question of whether the "purpose of trusteeship" clearly uses the words "independence," has not yet been resolved.</p>

<h3>Over a Hundred Carrier-Based Aircraft Scattered to Attack Kyushu; Japanese Reports Claim Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy carrier-based aircraft, mainly the giant F6F, including some PBF3 Swallow reconnaissance bombers, totaling 180 aircraft, launched a scattered attack on Japanese air bases in Kyushu around 3 PM on the 24th from Shibushi Bay and the waters west of the Satsuma Peninsula, in formations of ten or twenty aircraft each. The attack lasted about two hours. Japanese losses were extremely minor. Strict vigilance is required against this kind of enemy action as they approach Kyushu.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Yesterday morning, when B26 aircraft attacked Tokyo, they were fiercely intercepted by Japanese air defense forces. In Tokyo alone, ten enemy aircraft were shot down. The Yomiuri-Hochi Shimbun of the 25th reported on the circumstances of the downings as follows: Frequently, enemy B29 aircraft are reduced to a ball of fire before the eyes of the citizens and then fall, disappearing without a trace. One of the downed aircraft, after being intercepted by Japanese air defense forces, disintegrated in the air and fell in a certain place within the city. As it spiraled down, it caught fire and burned. The bodies of two pilots, wearing flight boots, presented a crude and grotesque sight. Inside the downed plane, a large globe was painted, with a B29 taking off from the center, and an outer circle depicting a small island actively flying towards hell. Now, it has unexpectedly and ironically fallen from the Tokyo sky towards hell.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Bans the Private Export of Rice</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The price of rice in the market has been rising recently.

<h3>Churchill Starts Organizing a Provisional British Cabinet; The Labor Party Prepares for General Election Competition</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Reuters Dispatch) - It is generally hoped that Prime Minister Churchill will announce the establishment of a provisional cabinet after the holiday, and Churchill is busy organizing a governmental structure to temporarily handle British affairs. Currently, there are over one hundred important vacant positions in the provisional cabinet, awaiting Churchill's selection and filling. Since Churchill is the leader of the majority party in the British House of Commons and is entrusted by royal mandate, he will use the Conservative Party exclusively to organize the cabinet. However, in fact, the important vacant positions will be filled by ministers who are nominally non-partisan. As for the key figures who are under Churchill's consideration to enter the provisional cabinet stage, they are none other than the following: Foreign Secretary Eden (probably will still be Churchill's right-hand man), Minister of Production Lyttelton, Lord Privy Seal Beaverbrook, Secretary of State for India Amery, Minister of Information Bracken, Minister of Education Butler, Minister of Agriculture Hudson, Minister of Health Willink, Minister of Food Llewellin, Minister of Works Sandys (Churchill's son-in-law), Minister of State Lawther, and Minister of Town and Country Planning Morrison. These are all major figures in the Conservative Party. In addition, there are a small number of non-partisan coalition cabinet ministers, such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson. In the Liberal Party, qualified candidates include Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Brown (leader of the National Liberal Party) and Lieutenant General George (Catholic Liberal). The changes to the cabinet have resulted in the resignation of wartime cabinet members such as Minister of Labour Bevin, Deputy Prime Minister Attlee, and Secretary of State Morrison. Prime Minister Churchill must form the provisional cabinet within two days, while Attlee is preparing his planned government, as the Labour Party has high hopes of winning the upcoming general election.</p>
<h3>Yu Feipeng Publishes Construction Opinions</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Chongqing broadcast: Chongqing Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, when meeting with foreign reporters on the 23rd, published his opinions on future construction and spoke of Chongqing's cooperation with the United States as follows: In order to develop the Northwest region, Chongqing plans to supplement a large number of vehicles to that area. At the same time, the food problem will also utilize the Southwest Highway and the Stilwell Road, but currently only military supplies are being transported. Chongqing is currently constructing long-distance railways and highways according to a five-year plan. Chongqing greatly welcomes cooperation with foreign countries on these projects. The powerful Japanese navy is the protector of Greater East Asia!</p>

His appointment as chief of the Economic Security Section will definitely contribute to economic security affairs in the future.</p>
<h3>Actual Land Tax for This City to Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>The land tax for this year in various counties and districts under the jurisdiction of this city, in accordance with the Central government's national policy, will be converted to payment in kind. Since the municipal government drafted various regulations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval, the municipal Finance Bureau has instructed the finance bureaus of various counties and various land tax collection offices in the city area to prepare for implementation. At the same time, a public announcement was published in the newspapers to inform the people. It is now reported that the municipal government and the municipal Finance Bureau have decided that the first phase of land tax will be collected uniformly in counties and districts starting on June 1st. After receiving the notification, all business households must comply and go to the nearest land tax collection office to clear the full amount without delay to avoid punishment.</p>
<p>Financial Bureau Holds Land Tax Conference</p>
<p>In order to increase the revenue for municipal finance, the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau has decided to actively organize the land tax in various counties and districts under its jurisdiction. It has scheduled a meeting for the 28th of this month to gather county magistrates, district commissioners, and important financial personnel to discuss strategies for organizing land tax.</p>
<h3>Intensified Preliminary Investigation Work for Spring Business Tax</h3>
<p>The city's Finance Bureau is collecting this year's spring business tax. Due to the efforts of tax officials in the suburbs and the eighth district, the procedures for merchants in the suburbs to declare and pay taxes are also very quick. The preliminary investigation work has generally been completed. The preliminary investigation work in the old one to eight districts began in separate districts as early as the 11th of this month. It is reported that the bureau, feeling that the first and eighth districts are centers of industry and commerce and that the preliminary investigation is quite difficult due to insufficient manpower, has ordered the transfer of 40 people from the suburbs who are engaged in tax work to assist in the investigation in the first and eighth districts. Fearing that Director Luo, who also serves as the bureau chief, would advance tax administration to enrich the municipal treasury, he convened a meeting of the heads of various districts under the Business Tax Section at 5:30 PM on the 24th to instruct them, and also offered condolences and encouragement.</p>
<h3>Committee for Raising Funds to Improve Sanitation in Prisons and Detention Centers Established; Donations Solicited from All Sectors Expected to Be Remitted Promptly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Committee for Raising Funds to Improve Sanitation in Prisons and Detention Centers was initiated by Wu Song, the Minister of Judicial Administration, along with Li Sihao, Chen Binhe, and Lin Kang, on the 18th of this month. A tea party was held at the Kangle Restaurant, inviting the business community. It is learned that the committee held its first establishment meeting on the 24th to discuss matters related to the organization of the management committee. In addition to the Minister of Judicial Administration serving as the chairman and the presidents of the Shanghai High Court and the High Procuratorate serving as ex officio members, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Chen Ribing, and Yuan Rongchang, the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, were also elected as standing committee members. Three groups were established within the committee: General Affairs, Finance, and Health, which will actively carry out their work. It is hoped that all donations that have been enthusiastically pledged by people from all walks of life will be sent to the Siming, Dalu, or Jin Cheng Banks, or the Shen Xin newspaper offices, before the end of this month to obtain receipts. Once the funds are collected, the sanitation improvement plan for prisons and detention centers can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Director of Police Bureau's Fire Department Gives an Overview of Firefighting Work; Reports at the Regular Press Conference</h3>
<p>The 18th regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held at 10 AM yesterday (25th) in the City Hall's conference room, where the Director of the Fire Department of the Police Bureau gave a report on the city's firefighting facilities.</p>
<p>General Work</p>
<p>Firefighting plans are divided into wartime and peacetime aspects. In peacetime, the firefighting work generally involves each branch investigating the water supply and terrain within its jurisdiction. Each branch must investigate hazardous materials or easily explosive objects stored in each household or warehouse within its jurisdiction. Once a fire occurs, each branch dispatches fire trucks within 30 seconds of the alarm ringing and arrives at the fire scene within five minutes. If a fire occurs on a ship in the Huangpu River, this department immediately assists the waterborne fire brigade in rescue efforts. In the event that the water pressure at the scene is insufficient, the water and electricity company can be called to increase the water supply. The power company also sends personnel to each branch on duty every day.</p>
<p>Air Defense Firefighting</p>
<p>Regarding air defense firefighting, the Fire Department has specially reorganized all personnel into air defense firefighting units in order to meet the needs. However, fire branches in each district respond immediately to fire alarms during peacetime. During air raids, they must listen to the orders of the director before dispatching trucks, as the current manpower and equipment are still insufficient to deal with fires during air raids. In order to make full use of resources, a focus-based approach must be adopted, responding opportunistically in order to cope with emergency situations with limited capacity. At the same time, in order to prevent water sources from being obstructed, planning for the construction of water storage pools and investigation of the use of river water is underway. Currently, there are a total of ten completed reservoirs, and a total of 74 will be built in the city in the future. In addition, if transportation is cut off, bicycles will be used as a contingency. Measures to prevent damage from coal gas are currently being trained on employees, guiding them with appropriate methods to be prepared.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Extortion</p>
<p>Illegal activities by firefighters will be severely cracked down on. In the past, a small number of unscrupulous personnel have been discovered, arrested, and severely punished, and judgments will be made soon. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will thoroughly understand: All firefighting costs in the event of a fire are covered by the government, and citizens do not need to pay. There will be no fines regardless of the nature of the fire alarm. Officials who go to the fire scene for investigation all have identification cards, and citizens can ask to see them at any time. If imposters are discovered or if there are extortionate acts, please report them immediately. The Fire Department never sends people to solicit the sale of firefighting equipment. If such people are discovered, they are imposters. Citizens must not offer bribes in the event of a fire.</p>
<h3>Standard Forms Should Be Completed When Applying to Adjust Sales Prices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Affairs Bureau states that the cost forms submitted by various trade associations or manufacturers when applying for price adjustments are inconsistent in style and the calculations are not comprehensive. Not only is the review time-consuming, but it is also difficult to accurately revise the sales prices. In order to facilitate review and standardize the formats, the bureau has submitted to the municipal government for approval and printed three types of standard cost calculation forms, which are applicable to manufacturing, import, and supply categories, respectively. Yesterday, the bureau ordered all manufacturers that from now on, all applications to adjust sales prices must uniformly obtain the forms from the Fifth Section of the bureau, fill them out according to the format, and submit them along with the relevant supporting documents for review.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Coordinates with Charity Organizations to Participate in Relief Work; Reducing Air Raid Damage and Maintaining Safety</h3>
<p>In order to reduce air raid damage, the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will hold "Air Defense Facility Enhancement Week" starting June 1st. It is learned that the Social Affairs Section of the headquarters, in order to maintain the safety of citizens during air raids, has specially convened the responsible persons of various public welfare and charitable organizations in the city, together with the Social Welfare Bureau, for a discussion at the bureau's auditorium the day before yesterday. More than 80 people, including Li Tianzhen and others, representing more than 60 organizations, including the World Red Swastika Society, attended the meeting. Zhou, the director of the Social Affairs Section of the Air Defense Headquarters, and Deputy Director Noguchi personally presided over the meeting, explaining the importance of air defense facilities and hoping that various charitable organizations would provide wartime services with the spirit of peacetime service. The representatives of various charitable organizations, feeling the kindness of the officials in charge in protecting citizens, were willing to contribute their full strength to air defense work and separately announced the implementation plans for temporary emergency care and accommodation. Subsequently, Director Zhou and Deputy Director Noguchi answered various difficult points raised by the representatives, and it was decided that the General Affairs and Social Affairs Sections of the Air Defense Headquarters and the Social Welfare Bureau would do their best to assist. The result was very satisfactory. It is now learned that all charitable organizations are rapidly preparing all aspects of their work. It is expected that the city's air defense work will be perfected by the participation of all public welfare and charitable organizations in the city.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Plans to Restore Qingdao Route</h3>
<p>According to sources in the city's shipping industry yesterday, the industry is planning to use sailing ships to sail to Qingdao in order to facilitate the flow of goods between North and Central China. This route has been suspended for more than a year, which not only affects transportation between North and Central China, but also has a close relationship with the development of industry and commerce. It is learned that the relevant authorities strongly support the restoration of this route and will provide full assistance.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Allocation Certificates for Periods 61 to 90 to Be Issued on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Municipal Goods Allocation Office has stipulated that the comprehensive allocation certificates for periods 61 to 90 will be issued from June 1st to June 30th. According to the certificate issuance procedures, three days before the issuance, the announcement of the scheduled issuance date should be read in front of the certificate issuing office. The landlord or their representative should represent their family or employees, and bring all household registration documents to the issuing office for verification and collection of the certificates. If the deadline is missed, an application for reissuance must be made at the issuing office during the supplementary certificate issuance period from July 1st to July 15th, but a late payment fine of 20 national currency units must be paid for each certificate. If the deadline is missed again, it will be considered a waiver and no reissuance will be made.</p>
<p>(Another report) The procedures for issuing comprehensive allocation certificates to residents of shantytowns in various districts of this city have been handled by the Pao-Chia Section of the Municipal Police Bureau. Later, the Goods Allocation Office had a proposal to handle the process itself. Because the allocation certificates for periods 31 to 60 had already been issued, it was too late to rush the process. Therefore, the process was changed to be handled by the Goods Allocation Office itself starting from period 61. The comprehensive allocation certificates for periods 61 to 90 will be issued soon. The Goods Allocation Office drafted regulations for investigating household registration and registering for certificate issuance for shantytowns in various districts, and sent them to the Pao-Chia Section for assistance. The section has now issued a notice to its subordinate general security liaisons and district offices to assist in the process.</p>
<h3>Measures for Temporary Requisition of Vehicles to Assist in the Evacuation of the City's Population</h3>
<p>In order to meet actual needs, the Municipal Construction Bureau has specially drafted temporary measures for the temporary requisition of vehicles, which have been submitted to the municipal government for promulgation and implementation. An excerpt of the measures is as follows: The bureau is ordered to assist in the evacuation of the population and requisition vehicles, so these measures are specially formulated. The type of vehicles to be requisitioned shall be limited to trucks suitable for long-distance transport. The number of trucks to be requisitioned is tentatively set at 20 per day, which shall be selected by the person in charge of the city's Truck Transport Industry Association and sent to the Land Transportation Committee of the City's Population Evacuation Committee for application and be subject to the management of the committee. The drivers, fuel, and repairs of the trucks shall be handled by the Land Transportation Committee of the City's Population Evacuation Committee itself. The depreciation and wear and tear of the requisitioned vehicles shall be compensated by the Land Transportation Committee of the Population Evacuation Committee. The start and end dates of the requisition of vehicles shall be determined by the Land Transportation Committee of the City's Population Evacuation Committee. These measures may be amended at any time if they are incomplete. These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the municipal government.</p>

<h3>Increased Grain Production in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>— Tang Yi</p>
<p>Governor Ren Discusses Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>"Jiangsu's land is fertile and has always been a rice-producing area. In recent years, it has made significant contributions to both wartime efforts and civilian food supplies. Therefore, the tasks borne by Jiangsu's farmers are extraordinarily important and particularly heavy. How to help the increasingly desolate rural areas catch their breath is not only the duty of Jiangsu's officials and people, but also a matter of great concern to neighboring provinces and cities due to the close relationship between them and the supply of food." When the reporter interviewed Governor Ren Yuandao on the 21st, Governor Ren expressed the above opinions, emphasizing the recent sharp rise in rice prices and its impact on people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>"Because of the poor harvests in some fields last year, and other various reasons, farmers are clearly lacking funds for re-production. If we hope for a sufficient food supply in the future, and to prevent rice prices from rising again, we must solve the current difficulties for farmers, allowing this year's rice crops to be cultivated smoothly and achieving a real increase in production.</p>
<p>"Some people in Shanghai, in light of this situation, have spontaneously launched a Jiangsu agricultural loan campaign, and I, on behalf of the farmers of Jiangsu, express my deep gratitude. The total amount of funds raised for this agricultural loan is 500,000 yuan, which is considerable in terms of numbers. However, given the vast area of Jiangsu and the many needs of the farmers, it cannot be said to be sufficient. Nevertheless, even if it is just a drop in the bucket, they will still receive the benefit of that drop, which is very beneficial for nurturing and restoring vitality to the rural areas. It is not only a current need, but also has a significant impact on the long-term plans of the country.</p>
<p>"Without even discussing the role of agricultural loans themselves, just the transfer of surplus funds from Shanghai to the rural areas is quite relevant to the stability of prices in Shanghai, and this is the first point. Secondly, that Shanghai leaders and people with assets can sacrifice their personal interests for the greater good, and not neglect long-term plans for temporary gains, this vision and spirit are worthy of admiration, and this shift in fashion can be said to be the dawn of national revival."</p>
<p>Provincial Government's Production Increase Efforts</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government not only hopes that agricultural loans can be implemented in the shortest possible time, but has also actually begun to increase food production from all sides. According to the reporter's observations, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Sujia Railway was destroyed, the provincial government has leased all the abandoned roadbeds from the railway company and distributed them to farmers along the line for cultivation. A total of 4,800 mu of farmland has been added. The provincial government provides seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural implements, while the farmers provide labor, and the harvest is distributed in a 4:6 ratio. The purpose of the provincial government is to increase production, not to make a profit, so it does not consider profits and losses. It is said that the farmers in the allocated areas are very enthusiastic, and the autumn harvest this year will surely be substantial.</p>
<p>The Provincial Construction Department has established an Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and an Agricultural, Forestry, and Fishery Production Supervision Office. The main tasks are three: training technical personnel, introducing improved seeds, and rewarding land reclamation. An experimental rice field is set up in Wuxian County, and a branch field is set up in Songjiang; a fishery experimental field is being established in Kunshan. In addition, efforts are being made to promote winter stem borer removal, protect farmland, improve sericulture, and encourage rural sideline occupations.</p>
<p>The Provincial Construction Department has, together with the New Life Movement, the Youth League, and the Baojia neighborhood organizations, investigated vacant land in the provincial capital and various counties to prepare for the establishment of demonstration farms. For example, if a private individual owns two gardens, it is stipulated that one of them should be used for increasing grain production; the areas around school playgrounds should also be used for planting. Regardless of the size of the area, the aim is to accumulate small amounts to make a large amount, and to integrate scattered pieces into a whole.</p>
<p>After Ren Yuandao took office as Governor of Jiangsu Province on November 10 last year, he first proclaimed "construction and production" as the focus of his administration. Under the leadership of Governor Ren, Construction Department Director Sun Yucai visited widely and made many innovations. The slogan put forward by Director Sun: "Construction projects and economic measures must be based on the needs of wartime; strengthen production increases and develop resources, in order to achieve prosperity for the people's livelihood." This is truly a good motto for a construction director!</p>
<h3>Introducing the Exhibition of Modern Japanese Culture</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>The Exhibition of Modern Japanese Culture is sponsored by the International Cultural Promotion Association and supported by this newspaper. It opened yesterday at the "Shanghai Art Gallery" on the upper floor of Dacolou at 212 Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>"Culture is neither something for enjoyment, nor does it only refer to the arts such as literature and music. The spirit of a nation's people striving for practical action is the highest expression of culture."</p>
<p>According to this broad concept, the photos displayed in the exhibition can be said to be various scenarios of Japan protecting and cultivating Eastern culture.</p>
<p>The nature and scope of the exhibition photos are very broad and can be divided into six parts:</p>
<p>The elite of the navy, army, and air force.</p>
<p>Military industry: including aircraft, iron and steel industry, power plants, automobile factories, shipbuilding industry, tank industry, worker life, etc.</p>
<p>Education: including national schools, science education, film education, and secondary schools. The educational conditions of girls' schools, higher vocational schools, and higher merchant marine schools.</p>
<p>Sports: including swimming, gliders, judo, kendo, archery, ball games, equestrianism, cycling groups, military training, student aviation, etc.</p>
<p>Social facilities: including battle reports of electric news, subways, etc.</p>
<p>Fine arts and crafts</p>
<p>There are a total of sixty-eight pieces. The exhibition will run from the 25th to the 30th. The hours are from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. Admission is free and all are welcome.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary: Emergency Measures</p>
<p>Recently, prices have been soaring, especially the skyrocketing price of rice, which is staggering. The frenzy of price increases is unprecedented. Just imagine that the lives of ordinary people were already struggling to breathe, and now they are suffering the oil on the fire, which is tantamount to declaring the death penalty for the common people. How can this not make people resentful!</p>
<p>In wartime, rising prices are originally an unavoidable phenomenon from an economic point of view. However, although the increase is inevitable, it should also be within a reasonable degree. An increase that exceeds a reasonable degree must not be due to economic reasons. In other words, the crazy and violent increase is entirely due to speculation and manipulation. Therefore, according to the principle of catching the thief, you must first catch the king, and to cut grass, you must first remove the roots, thorough and severe means must be used to eliminate the root causes of speculation and manipulation in order to be effective. Only strong political means are the real strength to capture the king and eliminate the roots. At a minimum, when using economic means to suppress prices, political means must be coordinated at the same time, and they must be implemented thoroughly and severely.</p>
<p>Complaining is useless. We very painfully hope that the authorities will pay attention to, in order to maintain the faith of the majority of citizens, they should quickly devise emergency measures to deal with the wild and violent rise in prices. We firmly believe that the wise authorities will not ignore this.</p>

<h3>Two Youth Associations Host Student Work-Study Loan</h3>
<p>Due to the rising prices and increasing difficulty of life in recent years, there are many students who are unable to afford tuition and have dropped out of school. Although they rely on enthusiastic assistance from all walks of life to rescue those who have dropped out, the serious problem of seeking education can be solved in a timely manner. However, some poor students still find it difficult to maintain their daily lives. Therefore, although they have been rescued from dropping out, their difficulties in life have not been alleviated. Therefore, a student work-study loan is specially organized, with the intention of encouraging students to engage in extracurricular production work to supplement the inadequacy of living expenses, and to cultivate self-help and diligence. Since its promotion, a considerable fund has been raised for use, and well-known people from all walks of life have been invited to form a work-study loan committee to preside over the matter. Formal applications will be accepted from the 28th of this month. Any student of secondary or higher school who wants to engage in extracurricular production work, has a considerable plan, and lacks a portion of funds, can apply for a loan at the Youth Association of Baxianqiao and the Women's Youth Association at 638 Xianhaiwei Road (Office hours: every Monday and Thursday from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM). Application forms are available for collection.</p>
