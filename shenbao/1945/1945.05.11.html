<h3>沖繩島戰事達最高潮　日軍施陣前逆襲　神鳳及特攻隊重創敵艦船</h3>
<p>南西睹島某基地十日中央社電冲繩方面敵人兵力，包括本島南北兩戰綫及慶良間列島，津堅島，伊江島等列島登陸軍在內，合計已達八師團之衆。查敵人自登陸以來，始終置攻擊重點於南部戰綫﹐兵力之半數以上，殆配置於該方面，與日守軍已作二十四天之決戰·登陸當夜，以霍齊少將所部陸軍第二十四軍團爲主力，然自南部戰綫日守軍呼應特攻隊之攻擊，而開始本格的反攻後，屬於第二十四軍團之第九十六，第二十七兩師，登陸後僅僅兩星期，損失慘重﹐戰力喪失一半以上。敵作戰指導部深慮前進有失，乃除陸軍隊之外，又新派尼米資所部海兵師團加入作戰。自此以後，海兵師團即處於指導戰鬥之立塲。按敵人於四月十六日將消耗慘重之第九十六，第二十七兩師調往後方，而調警衛塞班島之第一師及陸軍第七師共兩帥團至第一綫，謀强行突破首里北方之日軍陣地，於四月十九日及二十六日，藉海上兵力及空軍之掩護，分別舉行第一次及第二次總攻擊﹐然又遭日軍猛烈反攻，出血慘重﹐再遭挫折。自是以後，即反復作局部之反攻，同時整理部隊，謀圖作第三次總攻擊，自本月八日以來，全錢敵人攻勢突趨强大，總攻擊之色彩日爲濃厚·八日敵人於自里北方之前田，中間南方以及中聞西方之安波茶西方，同時開始猛攻，戰鬥至九日上午二時到達最高潮，然敵人攻勢卒因日軍之壯烈陣前逆襲﹐而再遭頓挫﹐然敵現仍急急自後補給兵力及兵器﹐至九日天明，再作全面的反擊，然均被日軍擊退。九日之戰，敵置主力於西海岸地區，又因戰塲天氣轉晴，日特攻隊航空部隊之攻擊亦轉激烈，自九日薄暮至下午九時，突入間本島周圍海上之敵艦船團，舉煊赫之戰果，下午七時二十分，於中城灣海面炸沉敵艦一艘，下午八時於湊川海面突入敵艦船羣，使敵亂放高射砲﹐陷入恐　混亂狀態。又下午八時四十五分，那覇海面發生沖天火柱一條，當係敵艦受炸起火。</p>
<p>（又電）日神風隊九日下午於琉球羣島南方發見敵機動部隊，猛勇突入，似已給與重大損害，同日傍晚至十日侵晨，日特攻隊數次出發，反復猛攻冲繩本島周圍敵艦若千，突入敵巡艦及其他大型艦使受重創。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>波瀾問題與聯合國前途</h3>
<p>在歐洲戰爭結束消息發表的同一天，却又有一則驚人的消息發表，就是舊金山會議，以波蘭問題爲中心的英美蘇聯問的爭執，幾至瀕於決裂﹐所以，除非山特魯曼﹐邱吉爾，史太林舉行三頭集會﹐勢難獲得解决云云。本來，波蘭問題，以與舊金山會議中其他議案相較，並不是大的問題，爲什麼竟會小題大做而鬧到這樣嚴重呢？這裏就很有値得研究的地方。</p>
<p>波蘭問題，誠如一般人所知道的﹐原是這次歐洲大戰的爆發點。當戰爭前夕﹐英法對波都已成立協定，負有與波蘭攻守同盟的義務。這一件事，回溯歷史﹐完全是英法當局企圖以波蘭爲對付蘇德之間的特殊勢力範團，並以波蘭爲基地而取得支配歐洲天陸的地位。當時蘇聯曾提出歐洲集體安全制度的辦法，與英法交涉﹐對於波蘭問題﹐即希望由英法蘇波四國建立聯合防衛陣綫。那時英法唯恐蘇聯勢力西進，終於拒絕了集體安全制度的建議，一面對德義取「綏靖政策」，一面對波蘭單獨締結同盟，而繼續以波蘭爲反蘇基地。蘇聯始轉而與德國締盟，成立德蘇互不侵犯條約，德國即於一星期後對波閃擊深入，波蘭政府一敗塗地，逃出國外，由法而英，渡其流亡生涯。英法在德軍對波蘭進攻後﹐也卽依約於九月三日對德宣戰。這次歐洲大戰﹐就是這樣爆發的。所以波蘭問題，確實不是一個簡單問題。</p>
<p>現在歐洲戰事雖已宣告結束﹐但是波蘭國內在蘇聯扶植下，成立了盧布林政權﹐更演進而爲華沙臨時政府﹐並先後獲得蘇聯﹐及親蘇的法國臨時政府，捷克·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞，南期拉夫等的承認。可是，流亡英國的舊波蘭政府﹐却仍在倫敦，仍爲英美及其他若干國家承認的波蘭合法政府﹐而特別是英國，一方面爲着維持自己的面子﹐一方面也不願根木放棄歷來對波瀾的政策，不顧承認蘇聯支持的華沙政權而從此退出歐洲大陸，偏安於三島　。所以﹐邱吉爾以下無一人不主張堅持不許華沙波蘭臨時政府參加舊金山會議﹔美國爲着拉攏英國，並藉以抑制蘇聯計﹐在未得其他口實之前，也只有利用波蘭問題支持英國主張。反之，蘇聯則爲了防止在西疆建造反蘇陳綫起見，自然對英美也非力爭不可。</p>
<p>舊金山議中，爲波蘭問題竟鬧得風雨滿城，且有陷於僵局形勢，其原因不外如上述。所以，有人說，波蘭問題不能解決﹐歐洲戰爭卽不能眞正結束。</p>
<h3>某軍事評論家　論亞歐局勢　太平洋作戰繼續邁進</h3>
<p>某軍事評論家，觀察最近太平洋戰局及歌戰結束後，英·美在大東亞戰爭之趨勢，發表基詳，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>沖繩日軍夾擊態勢</p>
<p>太平洋艦事中心，表面上仍集中於冲繩島周圍，日軍特攻隊對沖繩島周圍之美機動部隊及潛艇羣施以猛攻，結果使美軍受極大損害，在南部陸上戰鬥之日軍精銳，亦繼續猛攻﹐正向敵方從北面新近轉來之海兵第一師團及陸上七十七師團加以邀擊，此一帶之敵總兵力約共五個師團，已阻止敵軍之前進，日軍另一部份兵力，在敵之背後勇敢登陸，完成夾擊態勢。</p>
<p>美艦隊受重大損害</p>
<p>敵航空兵力及機動部隊，受日軍之潰滅打擊，其船艦損失甚多，所動餘者只有特式航空母艦而巳·日軍對中。北兩機塲勇猛進擊，巳使之受相當損失，不堪應用。八日敵機來襲者，累計不過六架﹐美軍如此迭受重大打擊，據路透電訊，其太平洋艦隊司令尼米資九日由大宮島廣播稱：此次冲繩島作戰，英國艦隊協助美軍，獲得意外效果，彼此實有同樣使命，今後希望英國艦隊繼續協力，並多加援助云云﹐由此可見太平洋美國艦隊已受重大損害。又據尼米資稱：美軍在首里與那原前方繼續攻擊，但因天氣不良，不能如預料之順利進行﹐戰事停頓中云。目下太平洋戰局兩舉已失平衡，美軍準備者有六個師團而已﹐以五個師團用於此次作戰，再加以太平洋之全部艦除﹐結果反使戰事停頓，毫無實效﹐由此可見不久之將來美軍定遭全面失敗。</p>
<p>歐洲戰局告一段落</p>
<p>據八日倫敦路透社電稱，普拉格之德軍戰鬥業已停止﹐已與聯合國軍宣告停戰，故而德軍之最後抵抗亦告終結，德國經納粹黨首領希特勒氏之統治，五年八個月以來英雄至今遭如此之結果，吾人實表示同情與尊敬。日華兩國必須抱必勝信念，奮戰到底，歐洲戰局告一斷落後，英美欲以全力用之太平洋上，敵力將領均異口同聲，努力主張短期決戰，其執政者如特魯曼，邸吉爾及格魯等，一面抑止國民休戰和平之要求，一面又深知日軍之不易應付，不得不苦心焦慮，作種種之計劃。</p>
<p>英美兵力移動困難</p>
<p>英美如欲移動其歐洲之兵力，因難多端，一爲國際間之政治問題，即英美蘇三國之微妙外交關係是，二爲軍事上技術問題之難於解決，如潛艇之缺乏，太平洋上基地之不足等，均爲其犖犖之大者。關於第一個問題，如八日莫洛托夫之由舊金山返莫斯科及日本東鄉外相之聲明等，即可瞭然。至第二個問題，即軍事上之披術問題，首爲船隻及潛艇之缺乏，據紐約泰晤士報評論家夏雷德稱：英美在歐洲之大部份兵力及軍需品等”如欲搬至太平洋上，需要相當之船舶及潸艇，即以美國之全部商船移用，亦屬不數。歐洲未解放區之食糧問題，近極嚴重，運輸上亦需要大量船隻，美國之全部商船，均已應用於此。其次爲太平洋上航空基地之不足，誠如尼米資所云，對日本攻擊時，必須甚多之基地，歐洲聯合空軍總司令斯柏士亦云﹐如欲以歐洲之空軍移用太平洋上，必須先有合式之基地。七日紐約合眾社訊，據軍事消息家稱，太平洋上之空軍基地，業已在全面使用中，今後如欲移動多量空軍，必須有多量之基地。尼米資九日會見新聞記者時亦稱，從歐洲移動空軍至太平洋上﹐基地成爲問題，今後必須努力獲得大量基地，以備應用﹐故移動空軍之如何困難，甚爲明顯﹐根據以上所述，敵人在歐空軍之兵力，即能移至中國大陸內地，但其數量在戰局上未必能發生影響也</p>
<p>日軍早有萬全準備</p>
<p>關於海軍兵力，聯合國大部份之海上兵力，在德軍未潰敗前，巳移至太平洋上應用，故歐洲戰事之結束，對於增强太平洋海上兵力，實無庸老慮耳。陸上兵力英美法等在歐洲第一綫上約計五個軍五十個師，合爲七十五萬人，與後方合計爲四百萬人，蘇聯第一綫兵力爲二百五十個師，合計爲四百萬人﹐最近美陸軍部發表解除二百萬人之動員，縱能移動歐洲之兵力至太平洋上，然在訓練作戰上，則必需相當長之時間。綜合以上各點，歐洲戰事之結束﹐對太平洋戰局無決定性之影響。八日美副國務　格督云，若謂日本對德軍之潰敗事先毫無準備者，實無其事，如謂其因此而感驚慌者，更不足信。我軍在太平洋之彼方作戰，爲程殊爲遙據，而日軍即單獨作戰，仍極堅强也。誠如格魯氏之言。日本早知歐洲戰局之將結束﹐事前已有萬全之準備，如九日日政府所發表者，對戰爭決意毫無變動，太平洋上作戰必繼續邁進，直至勝利爲止，日華兩國應互相提携，努力作戰﹐等待戴此光榮勝利之冠。</p>
<h3>泰拉干日軍　肉搏突擊</h3>
<p>婆羅洲基地十日中央社電　泰拉千之陸上攻防戰，自敵整備攻勢後，漸形熾烈，敵軍企圖突破日軍陣地，現在於西海岸機塲南側一帶，自凈水池向油田地帶擴大陳地，並猛烈砲擊淨水池方面日軍陣地，日軍則運日以肉搏隊深入敵陣，與敵以重創。服部軍造等若干勇士組成之肉搏隊，一日夜間擊潰持有輕機關槍之敵軍二十餘名﹐村井伍長等若干名，砲毀敵幕舍二處，殺傷敵兵三十餘名，又北岸軍曹等若干名挺身隊，六日夜間亦深入敵陣，殺傷敵兵七十五名，破毀幕舍一所，炸毀載重汽車一輛，機關槍座二處，總計已殺傷敵兵十分之二，達一千五百餘名。敵兵對日本肉搏隊異常恐懼，每至夜間則嚴加警戒，重要武躲戰車燈，皆移　後方，並驅使當地居民構築陣地，極力避免日軍攻擊，而日軍新銳特攻隊則分爲數組，連續對敵肉搏，與敵以致命創傷，日軍之流血作戰，已日趨熾烈。</p>
<h3>希特勒官邸地下室　發現重要文件</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據路透社莫斯科電﹕蘇軍工兵部隊繼續在柏林元首官邸地下壕﹐搜索希特勒元首遺骸。惟在宣傳部長郭培爾房間中，發現存藏文件之文件箱﹐內有希特勒元首親衛隊守衛官邸之計劃，又希特勒所用之歐洲地岡亦已被發現。</p>
<h3>美軍四十萬　將留駐歐陸</h3>
<p>里斯本十日巾央社電　華盛頓電：美軍接濟部長遜姆威爾九日宣稱，美國擬將歐洲陸軍每月調回十五萬至五十萬，共計撤囘三百十萬，預定在歐洲留駐守備隊四十萬名。</p>
<h3>軍令部組織中　部內分四廳　胡毓坤氏談增設意義</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國府當局爲增進統帥指揮效能，確定指導作戰。調遣部隊之統一機構，特增設軍令部，部長一職，由軍委會總參謀長胡毓坤上將兼任。記者爲明瞭該部設立意義，特於十日下午往訪胡氏﹐叩詢意見，承答如下﹕本會爲强化軍令機構，適應戰時體制，特設軍令部，其意義爲謀推進統制指導校　，並確定軍令·軍政之體制。今後關於軍事行政之業務，歸由陸軍部處理，關於指導作戰，調遣部隊’有關軍令之業務，歸由軍令部處理。部內分設第一·二·三·四廳，掌理各重要經營業務，現在　密組織中，軍令軍政運用，益趨圓滑與靈敏焉。</p>
<h3>祝防衛戰勝利　史太林演說　宣傳稱並無毀來德國意響</h3>

<h3>渝六全大會　各派意見不　國共磨擦愈演愈烈</h3>
<p>南京十日中央電社據重慶廣播稱：渝方所召開之國民黨第六次全國代表大會﹐在蔣介石主持下，於五日揭幕，首由蔣介石致訓詞，嗣即舉行預備會議，並於六日上午九時﹐在中央黨部舉行六全代表會主席團第二次會議，由居正主席，討論主席團分組車宜及提案審查委員會﹐宣貢起草委員會名單等。主席團決定分四組﹐蔣不親自出席﹐大會由主席團輪流主持，第一組爲居正，宋慶齡等九人﹐第二組爲于右任·鄒魯·陳果夫·張厲生。迺魯甌·林慶年等九人，第三組爲戴傳賢。張繼·陳誠等九人﹐第四組爲馮玉祥·孫科·張治中·潘公展·許世英等九人。審查委員曾分黨務·政治。經濟。敎育·軍事·外交六組，七日上午舉行六全代表大曾第一次大會﹐由吳鐵城作黨務報告﹐下午舉行第二次會議，由吳鼎昌作政治報告，程權毅。薛岳報告。八日繼續舉行第三次會議，蔣介石聽取軍事報告，並答覆各方對黨之質間，九日檢討黨政設施﹐此後則注重多方提案之討論。查此次渝六全大會召開之目的，在討論通過本年十一月十二日國父八土　辰時，國民大會之召集及樹立憲政之必要計劃，而對加强戰鬥力量，增進人民生活，改善對蘇邦交，以及對中共問題等，亦加以硏討，但觀蔣介石於五日之訓詞，對此數項均甚空洞，其對中共間關未隻字提及，而中共亦於上月舉行中共第七次全國代表大會，其目的即在應付渝六全大會，故渝六全大會之召開，其效果未見，而未必更將因此與中共　擦有愈演愈烈之勢，則爲不可掩之事。而參加此次會議之代表，有勵志派，親英美及中立者等三派，其三派領袖，無不想在會議，伸張勢力，內部意見該六全會議之召開，難有多大期待。</p>
<h3>舊金山會議內幕　焦點為波蘭問題</h3>
<p>這一個月以來，頗有華盛頓獨自美演得舊金山會議前奏曲，由於波瀾問題的糾紛和羅斯福的死亡，突然造成倫敦及莫斯科不協調的大合唱，然而會議仍然照着預定計劃要開幕的。羅斯福的死所造成的「美國態度改變」﹐蘇聯非常重視，即從蘇聯改派莫洛托夫外交人民委員長這一點，也可以知道。羅斯福曾不願一切地建設起一架美國及蘇聯間的「和平橋樑」，面臨舊金山會議的，羅斯福的突然死亡，在蘇聯看來似乎是失掉了這架「橋樑」。我們只要回憶一下雅爾達會議羅斯福，邱吉爾，史泰林三人間所存在着得「密約」，就可以證明這一事實。克里米亞會議的歸途上，三月二十八日羅斯福在阿爾及爾曾對EP，UP，INS三通信社的記者說過</p>
<p>「在克里米亞會議上，史太林人氏委員會主席，邱吉爾內閣總理大臣刊我三人問，曾成立過某種秘密協定。內容﹐由時間來自然而然地說明，至於期間或許此較很短﹐也或許拖延五六十年年。」</p>
<p>這一密約，是有幾許理由可以斷定爲戰後歐洲各國的政治形態的。</p>
<p>蘇聯疑慮</p>
<p>羅斯福的「理想主義」和史太林的「現實主義一二者結合而生的這種「密約」，在羅斯福逝世特魯曼上台以後，是否還會繼續呢？這一點就是蘇聯疑慮的中心所在，也就莫洛托夫不得不出席舊金山會議的理由。</p>
<p>例如蘇聯一再强調﹐舊金山會議不得爲「國際聯盟之復活」。又四月四日莫斯科廣播無綫電台﹐曾把眞理報社評之一段內史太林的講演加以廣播，說：「如果舊金山會議違犯美英蘇三國以諒解及和協精神解決問題的根本條件時，則決不會得到好的結果」。然而莫斯科﹐華盛頓，倫敦三者間所能規定的「諒解」和「和協」範圍，反正不出該三國從大戰中所學習的「自已喜歡之和平」範圍，。這種「諒解」和「和協」的存續，正如羅斯福的含混話一樣：「或許比較很短的期間﹐也或許拖延至五六十年也不一定」。問題是在於整個舊金山會議怎樣規定他們所希望的各個國家之政治形態。</p>
<p>舊金山會議將成爲這些四十多個被邀謂國，在基本的三大國勢力影響下的「安全機構」中，追求本國利益的表演會。這就是舊金山會議的歸宿。被和平幻想所迷惑的小國，似乎對於日本及德國決心繼續戰爭這一事實，視若無睹，但實際上戰後將改組的國家，是在戰後國際機構主幹的英美蘇三大國「和協」基礎即將崩潰的事實前戰慄着。造成基礎崩潰的最大原因，就是波蘭問題。現行華沙政權參加舊金山會議的問題，竟遭英美拒絕，這實在令人玩味。誇大一點說，這個波蘭問題的處理方式背後，象徵着美英及蘇聯間的一切矛盾和對立。我們只要回想一下，英國之所以對德宣戰，是由於德國向波蘭進軍所致這一歷史上的事實，也就可以恍然大悟。同時倫敦當局的政治意識﹐認爲波蘭是英國對德國的軍事及政治橋頭堡，也認爲是對蘇聯的橋頭堡。</p>
<p>張伯倫在慕尼黑會議上造成英國「敗北」的事實——就是倫敦當局想利用納粹德國爲英國對蘇的橋頭堡這一見解，在納粹德團對蘇宣戰，繼而英蘇合作以後，也決未淸算。只要看看邱吉爾的著名宣言：「我決不是上合來作大英帝國的解體者」，也就可以明瞭。波闌流亡政府只有擁護英國這種政治意識﹐才能取得生存，這種情形一直到今天，始終未變。克里米亞會談後﹐不得不承認穌聯所樹立的波蘭政府之旣成事實時，英美也不爽快地承認現華沙政府，而使用「擴大華沙政權﹐英美承認之」字樣，這就是企圖努力保證英美在新波闌政府的政治影響。現波闌政府，羅斯福稱之爲「缺乏統一的國家」。自然羅斯福，邱吉爾，史太林三位「伙伴」們，決不會知道這個不統一的真實意義，運種「分裂」的情形，在戰後國際安全機構中擴大和發展的時候，則自詡爲「和平」愛好者的他們﹐就會重新準　動武。</p>
<p>華沙示威</p>
<p>在這一點上，蘇聯所扶　起來的波瀾解放委員到目前的華沙政府，這種力量自然英美是非常不高興的。試看美國前任動員局長官潘茲﹐由克里米亞會談囘歸華盛頓時所說的話，就充分可以表明。</p>
<p>「被解放國家中的人們，凡想掌握政權，就要先取得大國的支持方可以行動，這種傾向非常顯著。</p>
<p>近如今日的波蘭，這種傾向尤爲明顯。在美英蘇三國看來，波蘭解放本身並不重要，而重要者，是用何種形式來解放。邱吉爾在二月二十七日議會上會報告雅爾達會議的決定，關於波瀾的「統一」，他曾近出自己的悲痛希望。</p>
<p>「應當保全波蘭人民的獨立？抑用壓力而不管波闌意志如何﹐使其成爲蘇聯的保護國﹖這比劃定國境還更重要。」</p>
<p>邱吉爾，波闌政府固應採取「對穌友好的政策」﹐政權性格應當「在聯合國的援助之下，由國民的總意來決定」。現華沙政權﹐並不合於邱吉爾的這種「喜歡」。但不懂現華沙政權對拒絕波蘭參加舊金山會議提出嚴重抗議，說「倫敦流亡政府，乃違反波瀾人民總意之機構」﹐而且翌日蘇聯曾用塔斯社支持這一宜言。英美固然可以對這一宣言置之不理，但蘇聯在舊金會議前一定還會會要求特魯曼的美國，准許現華沙政權參加會議（四月十九日美國國務院公佈），以表示其決心。美國對蘇聯的回答；</p>
<p>「美國政府對於波闌參加會議的要求，絕對主張按克里米亞的決議組成新全國一致的臨時政府後，才能批</p>
<p>歐洲恐怖</p>
<p>流亡波闌政權的數名閣員，到莫斯科求妥協的途中，業已「失踪」。倫敦的主張，也證　華盛頓的主張。就是說，英美如全部承認華沙政府的政治性格﹐則關於形成法國﹐南斯拉夫，波羅的海三小國﹐芬闌，捷克斯拉夫﹐保加利亞·羅馬尼亞，以及其他歐洲和巴爾幹各）國的政治性格上﹐將跟蘇聯失掉「和協」﹐結果就會推想到英業的政治失敗，所以現在的英美﹐對於雨後春筍般出現的「缺乏統一國家」，就是戰後最大的恐怖。唯其預料到有恐怖﹐才在稚爾達發生「密約」。</p>
<p>這一恐怖日益在强化着，因爲蘇聯利用英美反對納粹德國的口號「擁護民主主義」，而保證了蘇聯政治性格的影響力勝利了。英美對於道種蘇聯的「勝利」，想在舊金山會議上以目己所喜歡的民主主義壓倒它，這就是會議的主要意義之一。現在的波蘭問題﹐對於全世界總意的組織上說，就是重大的成敗試金石。這個問題，或將是希特勒在納粹黨綱制定二十五周年紀念日（二月二十四日）所喊出的，因共同鬥爭所團結的資本主義和波爾什維克二者間，不自然「聯合」的歸宿。（譯自四月二十六日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>The Battle of Okinawa Reaches its Climax: Japanese Forces Launch a Preemptive Counterattack, Kamikaze and Special Attack Units Heavily Damage Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base on a Nansei Islands (Ryukyu Islands) island, dated the 10th: Enemy forces in the Okinawa area, including landing forces on the northern and southern fronts of the main island, as well as on the islands of Kerama, Tsuken, and Ie, have reached a total strength of eight divisions. Since landing, the enemy has consistently focused its attacks on the southern front, deploying more than half of its forces in that area. The Japanese garrison has been engaged in a decisive battle for 24 days. On the night of the landing, the U.S. Army's 24th Corps, commanded by Major General Hodge, was the main force. However, after the Japanese garrison on the southern front launched a full-scale counteroffensive in coordination with special attack units, the 96th and 27th Divisions of the 24th Corps suffered heavy losses within just two weeks of landing, losing more than half of their combat strength. Deeply concerned about the lack of progress, the enemy command, in addition to army units, dispatched the Marine divisions under Nimitz to join the operation. Since then, the Marine divisions have been in a position to direct the battle. On April 16, the enemy transferred the heavily depleted 96th and 27th Divisions to the rear, and deployed the 1st Division, which had been guarding Saipan, and the 7th Army Division, a total of two divisions, to the front line, attempting to forcefully break through the Japanese positions north of Shuri. On April 19 and 26, with the support of naval forces and airpower, they launched the first and second general offensives, respectively. However, they were again met with fierce Japanese counterattacks, suffering heavy casualties and setbacks. Since then, they have repeatedly launched local counterattacks while reorganizing their forces, planning for a third general offensive. Since the 8th of this month, the enemy's overall offensive has suddenly intensified, and the signs of a general offensive have become increasingly strong. On the 8th, the enemy simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the Maeda area north of Shuri, the southern part of Nakama, and the area west of Awa, west of Nakama. The battle reached its climax at 2:00 AM on the 9th, but the enemy's offensive was ultimately thwarted by a brave Japanese preemptive counterattack. However, the enemy is still urgently replenishing troops and equipment from the rear. At dawn on the 9th, they launched another full-scale counterattack, but all were repelled by Japanese forces. In the battle on the 9th, the enemy placed its main force in the west coast area. Furthermore, as the weather in the battle area cleared, the attacks by Japanese special attack air units also became more intense. From dusk to 9:00 PM on the 9th, they broke through the enemy fleet around the main island, achieving glorious results. At 7:20 PM, they sank an enemy warship in the waters of Nakagusuku Bay. At 8:00 PM, they broke into enemy ship formations in the waters off Minatogawa, causing the enemy to fire anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately and fall into a state of panic and confusion. Also at 8:45 PM, a pillar of fire reaching the sky appeared in the waters off Naha, indicating that an enemy warship had been hit and caught fire.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) On the afternoon of the 9th, Japanese kamikaze units discovered an enemy mobile unit south of the Ryukyu Islands and launched a fierce attack, apparently inflicting significant damage. From the evening of the same day to the early morning of the 10th, Japanese special attack units departed several times, repeatedly and fiercely attacking several enemy warships around the main island of Okinawa, breaking through enemy cruisers and other large ships, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Cai Expresses Determination</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 10th: Cai Peihuang, our ambassador to Japan, who will soon return to China from Japan, issued the following statement on the 10th expressing China's determination to fight alongside Japan: China, which has firmly united with Japan, will not waver due to the sudden changes in the European war, needless to say. The war aim of the Japanese government is self-existence and self-defense, which is the same as that of China. The resolution of the Japanese government is the resolution of China. China's unswerving resolution to move forward towards the goal of war remains unchanged, and it is regretful that the allied Germany has surrendered due to unfavorable war situation. However, we, who aim to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, have not changed in the slightest, needless to say. However, China has not made any significant contributions to date, which is regrettable. We deeply feel that we must strengthen our efforts to defeat the common enemy.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Kyushu and Shikoku Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from Osaka, dated the 10th: More than 200 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked the regions of Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu yesterday morning. At around 5:40 AM, one enemy aircraft entered from the Bungo Channel and turned into the Sea of Japan from western Yamaguchi Prefecture, heading towards the southwestern tip of Shikoku. After 6:00 AM, about 30 aircraft circled the southwestern tip of Shikoku, divided into three echelons, heading north along the west coast of Shikoku, traversing the central part of Shikoku from the Inland Sea, and heading south after 8:00 AM. In addition to bombing the vicinity of Matsuyama, other enemy aircraft also dropped bombs into the sea near the Misaki Peninsula. Also, at around 7:00 AM, one B-29 aircraft circled Tosa Bay, dropping bombs into the bay. From around 8:00 AM, approximately 200 enemy aircraft gathered over the sea southwest of Shikoku, and from around 9:00 AM, they divided into more than a dozen formations and headed north along the Straits of Tsushima, intruding into western Yamaguchi Prefecture. After bombing both Yamaguchi and Hiroshima Prefectures, they headed towards the sea south near Matsuyama, Shikoku.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, dated the 10th: Gu, the Japanese Ambassador to China, returned to his country to discuss important public affairs, arriving in Beiping at 6:30 PM on the 8th. At 4:40 PM on the 10th, he and his entourage, including Counselor Ota, Secretary Shimizu, and Sakagaki, from the Japanese Embassy and the Beiping Office, visited Chairman Wang of the Political Affairs Committee. Mr. Wang received them for five minutes along with Director Su Tioren and other officials, after which Ambassador Gu departed.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ogate Taketora Appointed Cabinet Advisor</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 10th: The Japanese government requested the appointment of Ogata Taketora as a Cabinet Advisor, and the official appointment was made on the 10th. Mr. Ogata is a representative of the Japanese media world and has served as Minister of State and Director-General of the Information Bureau, among other positions.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Chongqing</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report: According to reliable sources in this city, a major fire broke out in Chongqing City. It is reported that the fire originated in a residence on Anle Tong Street in Chongqing on the night of the 8th of this month due to carelessness. The fire spread rapidly and could not be controlled, affecting nearby shops and residences. As a result, 725 residences were destroyed, and 3,683 people were affected, making this an unprecedented disaster for Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Hubei Province Air Raid Relief Committee</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from Hankou, dated the 10th: The Hubei Province Air Raid Relief Committee, considering its mission to be of utmost importance, has decided to implement a reorganization. Therefore, a reorganization meeting was specially convened yesterday. Governor Ye, Mayor Shi, and officials, gentry, and celebrities from the three towns of Wuhan all attended, discussing strengthening strategies in detail. In the future, the internal structure will consist of six groups: General Affairs, Relief, Food, Allocation, Construction, and Sanitation.</p>
<h3>The Pope Appeals for the Construction of a Just Peace, A Golden Opportunity to Thoroughly Reconstruct the World</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from the Vatican, dated the 10th: On the occasion of the cessation of hostilities in Europe, the Pope made a brief broadcast yesterday at the Vatican, calling for peace to be built in an atmosphere of mutual trust and complete justice, replacing deception and malice with truth and goodwill. In the face of the great difficulties facing Europe, the corruption of public institutions, famine and misfortune, the barbarization of customs, and the licentiousness of youth are all scenes of the present time. Therefore, a solid peace cannot be established unless it is with a sincere heart. The new world should be based on faith, respect for humanity, and the equal rights of all nations, large and small, strong and weak. Now is a good time to rebuild the world, and we hope that prisoners of war and detained civilians will quickly be able to return to their homes to engage in the work of peace.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Polish Question and the Future of the United Nations</h3>
<p>On the same day that the news of the end of the war in Europe was announced, another shocking news item was released, that the San Francisco Conference was on the verge of collapse due to the dispute between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union centered on the Polish issue, and that it would be difficult to resolve unless Truman, Churchill, and Stalin held a three-way summit. Originally, the Polish issue was not a major issue compared with other proposals at the San Francisco Conference. Why did it become such a serious problem? There are things worth studying here.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the Polish issue was the flashpoint for this European war. On the eve of the war, Britain and France had established an agreement with Poland, obligated to an alliance of mutual defense. Looking back at history, this was entirely because the British and French authorities attempted to use Poland as a special sphere of influence against the Soviet Union and Germany, and to gain control of the European continent with Poland as a base. At that time, the Soviet Union proposed a system of collective security in Europe and negotiated with Britain and France, hoping that Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland would establish a united defense line on the Polish issue. At that time, Britain and France were afraid of the westward advance of Soviet power, and finally rejected the proposal for a collective security system, adopting a "policy of appeasement" towards Germany and Italy on the one hand, and forming an alliance with Poland alone on the other, continuing to use Poland as an anti-Soviet base. The Soviet Union then turned to form an alliance with Germany, establishing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. A week later, Germany launched a blitzkrieg against Poland, and the Polish government was defeated and fled abroad, living its exiled life in France and then Britain. After the German army attacked Poland, Britain and France also declared war on Germany on September 3 in accordance with the agreement. This is how the European war broke out. So the Polish issue is indeed not a simple issue.</p>
<p>Now, although the war in Europe has been declared over, the Lublin regime has been established in Poland with the support of the Soviet Union, and has further evolved into the Warsaw Provisional Government, which has been recognized successively by the Soviet Union, the pro-Soviet French Provisional Government, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and others. However, the old Polish government in exile in Britain is still in London, and is still recognized as the legitimate government of Poland by Britain, the United States, and some other countries. In particular, Britain, on the one hand, wants to maintain its own face, and on the other hand, is unwilling to completely abandon its long-standing policy toward Poland, ignoring the recognition of the Warsaw regime supported by the Soviet Union and withdrawing from the European continent, living in isolation on the three islands. Therefore, no one below Churchill advocates insisting on not allowing the Warsaw Polish Provisional Government to participate in the San Francisco Conference. The United States, in order to win over Britain and to restrain the Soviet Union, can only use the Polish issue to support Britain's position before obtaining other excuses. Conversely, in order to prevent the construction of an anti-Soviet front in the western border, the Soviet Union naturally has to argue with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>In the San Francisco Conference, the Polish issue has caused a great deal of commotion and is in a stalemate, and the reason is nothing more than the above. Therefore, some people say that the European war cannot truly end if the Polish issue cannot be resolved.</p>
<h3>A Military Commentator Discusses the Situation in Asia and Europe, The Pacific Operations Continue to Advance</h3>
<p>A certain military commentator, observing the recent Pacific war situation and the trend of Britain and the United States in the Greater East Asia War after the end of the war, has published a detailed report, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Forces in Okinawa in a Pincer Formation</p>
<p>The center of the Pacific naval war remains concentrated around Okinawa Island on the surface. Japanese special attack units have launched fierce attacks on the US mobile units and submarine groups around Okinawa Island, resulting in great damage to the US military. The elite Japanese troops in the southern land battle also continued to launch fierce attacks, and are engaging the Marine 1st Division and the Army 77th Division, which have recently transferred from the north. The total enemy force in this area is about five divisions, which has stopped the enemy's advance. Another part of the Japanese forces bravely landed behind the enemy and completed a pincer formation.</p>
<p>U.S. Fleet Sustains Heavy Damage</p>
<p>Enemy air power and mobile units have been crushed and attacked by Japanese forces, and their ships have suffered heavy losses. All that remains are special aircraft carriers. Japanese forces have launched a fierce attack on the central and northern airfields, causing them considerable damage and making them unusable. On the 8th, the number of enemy aircraft that came to attack totaled no more than six. The US military has suffered such repeated heavy blows. According to Reuters, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, Nimitz, broadcast from Omiya Island on the 9th, saying: This time, the British fleet assisted the US military in the Okinawa Island operation and achieved unexpected results. The two sides have the same mission. In the future, we hope that the British fleet will continue to cooperate and provide more assistance. This shows that the US Pacific Fleet has suffered heavy damage. According to Nimitz, the US military continued to attack in front of Shuri and Yonabaru, but due to bad weather, the operation could not proceed as expected, and the war was stagnating. At present, the two sides of the Pacific war situation have lost balance. The US military is preparing only six divisions. Using five divisions for this operation, plus the entire Pacific fleet, has resulted in a stagnant and ineffective war. It is clear that the US military will suffer a complete defeat in the near future.</p>
<p>The European War Comes to an End</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 8th, the German forces in Prague have stopped fighting and have announced an armistice with the Allied forces. Therefore, the final resistance of the German army has also come to an end. The heroic result of Germany under the rule of Nazi Party leader Hitler for five years and eight months is what we are witnessing today. We express our sympathy and respect. Japan and China must have a belief in certain victory and fight to the end. After the European war comes to an end, Britain and the United States want to devote their full efforts to the Pacific. The enemy leaders all unanimously advocate a short-term decisive battle. Their rulers, such as Truman, Churchill, and Gru, on the one hand, suppress the demands of the people for a truce and peace, and on the other hand, know that the Japanese army is not easy to deal with, and have to painstakingly worry and make all kinds of plans.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Moving British and American Forces</p>
<p>There are many difficulties for Britain and the United States to move their European forces. One is the international political problem, that is, the subtle diplomatic relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The second is the military and technical problems that are difficult to solve, such as the lack of submarines and the lack of bases in the Pacific. Regarding the first question, the statements by Molotov's return from San Francisco to Moscow on the 8th and Japanese Foreign Minister Togo can be understood. As for the second question, the military technical problem, the first is the lack of ships and submarines. According to New York Times commentator Xia Leide, if Britain and the United States want to move most of their forces and military supplies in Europe to the Pacific, they need considerable ships and submarines, even if the entire US merchant fleet is transferred, it is not enough. The food problem in the non-liberated areas of Europe is extremely serious, and a large number of ships are also needed for transportation. The entire US merchant fleet has been used for this. Secondly, the lack of air bases in the Pacific. As Nimitz said, many bases are needed to attack Japan. Spafford, the commander of the European Allied Air Force, also said that if the European air force is to be transferred to the Pacific, there must first be suitable bases. A Reuters dispatch from New York on the 7th quoted military sources as saying that the air bases in the Pacific are already in full use. In the future, if a large number of air forces are to be moved, there must be a large number of bases. Nimitz also said when meeting with reporters on the 9th that the transfer of the air force from Europe to the Pacific is a problem, and we must work hard to obtain a large number of bases for application in the future. Therefore, the difficulty of moving the air force is very obvious. Based on the above, even if the enemy's air force in Europe can be moved to the mainland of China, its quantity may not have an impact on the war situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Have Long Been Fully Prepared</p>
<p>Regarding naval forces, most of the naval forces of the United Nations had been transferred to the Pacific before the German army was defeated. Therefore, the end of the war in Europe is not a concern for strengthening the Pacific naval forces. On the ground forces, Britain, the United States, France, etc. have about five armies and fifty divisions, a total of 750,000 people, on the front line in Europe, and a total of 4 million people including the rear. The Soviet Union's front-line troops are 250 divisions, totaling 4 million people. Recently, the US Department of the Army announced the release of 2 million people's mobilization. Even if the forces in Europe can be moved to the Pacific, it will take a considerable amount of time for training and combat. In summary, the end of the war in Europe has no decisive impact on the Pacific war. Deputy Secretary of State Gru said on the 8th, "It would be untrue to say that Japan had no preparation for the defeat of the German army, and it would be even more incredible to say that it was alarmed by it. Our army is fighting in the Pacific Ocean, which is very far away, and the Japanese army is still extremely strong even if it fights alone." As Gru said, Japan has long known that the European war is about to end and has been fully prepared in advance. As the Japanese government announced on the 9th, the determination to war has not changed, and the Pacific operations will continue to advance until victory. Japan and China should support each other and work hard to fight, and wait for the glory of victory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tarakan Launch Bayonet Assault</h3>
<p>From a Central News Agency dispatch from a base on Borneo, dated the 10th: The land battle of attack and defense in Tarakan has gradually intensified after the enemy prepared its offensive. The enemy army is attempting to break through the Japanese positions. Now, in the area south of the airfield on the west coast, it is expanding its positions from the water purification plant to the oil field area, and is fiercely shelling the Japanese positions in the water purification plant area. The Japanese army is sending bayonet assault teams into the enemy lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. A bayonet assault team composed of several brave men, including Gunzo Hattori, annihilated more than 20 enemy soldiers holding light machine guns one night. Sergeant Murai and several others destroyed two enemy barracks with artillery, killing and wounding more than 30 enemy soldiers. On the night of the 6th, a suicide squad led by Sergeant Kitagishi also penetrated deep into the enemy lines, killing and wounding 75 enemy soldiers, destroying one barracks, blowing up one truck, and destroying two machine gun emplacements. In total, they have killed and wounded about two-tenths of the enemy soldiers, amounting to more than 1,500. Enemy soldiers are unusually fearful of the Japanese bayonet assault teams. Every night, they are heavily guarded, and important weapons, such as tank lights, have been moved to the rear. They are also forcing local residents to build positions, trying to avoid Japanese attacks. Meanwhile, the Japanese new elite special attack units are divided into several groups and continue to launch bayonet assaults on the enemy, inflicting fatal injuries on the enemy. The Japanese bloody warfare is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>

<h3>KMT's Sixth National Congress in Chongqing: Differing Opinions Among Factions; KMT-CCP Friction Intensifies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to Chongqing broadcasts: The Kuomintang's Sixth National Congress, convened in Chongqing under the chairmanship of Chiang Kai-shek, opened on the 5th. Chiang Kai-shek delivered an address, followed by a preparatory meeting. On the morning of the 6th, at 9:00 AM, the second meeting of the presidium of the Sixth National Congress was held at the Central Party Headquarters, chaired by Ju Zheng, to discuss the grouping of the presidium and the proposal review committee, and to announce the list of the drafting committee, etc. The presidium decided to divide into four groups: Chiang did not personally attend, and the congress was chaired by the presidium in rotation. The first group consisted of Ju Zheng, Soong Ching-ling, and nine others; the second group consisted of Yu Youren, Zou Lu, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Nai Luweng, Lin Qingnian, and nine others; the third group consisted of Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Ji, Chen Cheng, and nine others; the fourth group consisted of Feng Yuxiang, Sun Ke, Zhang Zhizhong, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Shiying, and nine others. The review committee was divided into six groups: party affairs, politics, economy, education, military affairs, and foreign affairs. The first general session of the Sixth National Congress was held on the morning of the 7th, with Wu Tiecheng giving a report on party affairs. The second session was held in the afternoon, with Wu Dingchang giving a political report, and Cheng Quan-yi and Xue Yue also giving reports. The third session continued on the 8th, with Chiang Kai-shek listening to military reports and answering questions from various parties about the party. On the 9th, party and government facilities were reviewed. Afterwards, the focus was on discussing various proposals. The purpose of convening this Sixth National Congress in Chongqing was to discuss and pass the necessary plans for convening a National Assembly and establishing constitutional government on November 12th of this year, the 80th anniversary of the birth of the founding father. Strengthening combat power, improving people's lives, improving relations with the Soviet Union, and the issue of the Chinese Communist Party were also discussed. However, judging from Chiang Kai-shek's address on the 5th, these points were very vague, and he did not mention a word about relations with the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party also held its Seventh National Congress last month, with the aim of responding to the Sixth National Congress in Chongqing. Therefore, the convening of the Sixth National Congress in Chongqing has not shown results, and it may further intensify friction with the Chinese Communist Party, which is an undeniable fact. The representatives participating in this meeting included three factions: the Livelihood Improvement faction, the pro-British and American faction, and the neutral faction. The leaders of the three factions all wanted to expand their influence at the meeting, and due to internal disagreements, little can be expected from the convening of the Sixth National Congress.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the San Francisco Conference: The Focus is the Polish Question</h3>
<p>For the past month, Washington has been largely performing the prelude to the San Francisco Conference solo. Due to the disputes over the Polish question and the death of Roosevelt, a discordant chorus suddenly arose between London and Moscow. However, the conference will still open according to the scheduled plan. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the "change in American attitude" caused by Roosevelt's death, as can be seen from the Soviet Union's decision to reassign Molotov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Roosevelt had spared no effort to build a "bridge of peace" between the United States and the Soviet Union. Faced with the San Francisco Conference, Roosevelt's sudden death seemed to the Soviet Union to have lost this "bridge." We only need to recall the "secret agreement" that existed among Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin at the Yalta Conference to prove this fact. On the way back from the Crimean Conference, Roosevelt told reporters from EP, UP, and INS in Algiers on March 28:</p>
<p>"At the Crimean Conference, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Stalin, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Churchill, and I had a certain secret agreement. The content will be naturally explained by time, and the period may be very short, or it may be delayed for fifty or sixty years."</p>
<p>There are several reasons to determine that this secret agreement was related to the political form of various European countries after the war.</p>
<p>Soviet Doubts</p>
<p>Will this "secret agreement," which was born from the combination of Roosevelt's "idealism" and Stalin's "realism," continue after Roosevelt's death and Truman's accession to power? This is the focus of Soviet doubts and the reason why Molotov had to attend the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>For example, the Soviet Union has repeatedly emphasized that the San Francisco Conference must not be a "revival of the League of Nations." Furthermore, on April 4, Moscow Radio broadcast a passage from the editorial of the Pravda newspaper, including Stalin's speech, saying: "If the San Francisco Conference violates the fundamental conditions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to solve problems with understanding and harmony, then it will not get good results." However, the scope of "understanding" and "harmony" that can be stipulated by Moscow, Washington, and London is, in any case, no more than the scope of "peace of their own liking" that the three countries have learned from the war. The continuation of this "understanding" and "harmony" is just like Roosevelt's ambiguous words: "Perhaps it will be a very short period, or it may be delayed for fifty or sixty years." The problem lies in how the entire San Francisco Conference will stipulate the political form of each country they hope for.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference will become a performance for these forty-odd invited countries to pursue their national interests in the "security mechanism" under the influence of the three major powers. This is the destination of the San Francisco Conference. Small countries, misled by peaceful fantasies, seem to turn a blind eye to the fact that Japan and Germany are determined to continue the war, but in reality, the countries to be reorganized after the war are trembling before the fact that the foundation of the "harmony" of the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which is the backbone of the post-war international mechanism, is about to collapse. The biggest reason for the collapse of the foundation is the Polish question. The fact that the current Warsaw regime was rejected by Britain and the United States from participating in the San Francisco Conference is really intriguing. To exaggerate a little, the way this Polish question is handled symbolizes all the contradictions and oppositions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. We only need to recall the historical fact that Britain declared war on Germany because Germany invaded Poland to be suddenly enlightened. At the same time, the political consciousness of the London authorities regards Poland as Britain's military and political bridgehead to Germany, and also as a bridgehead to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The fact that Chamberlain created the "defeat" of Britain at the Munich Conference - that is, the London authorities' idea of using Nazi Germany as Britain's bridgehead to the Soviet Union - was never cleared up after Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union and then Britain and the Soviet Union cooperated. We only need to look at Churchill's famous declaration: "I will never be the one to dismantle the British Empire" to understand. The Polish government in exile can only survive by supporting Britain's political consciousness, and this situation has not changed to this day. When it was forced to recognize the accomplished fact of the Polish government established by the Soviet Union after the Crimean talks, Britain and the United States did not readily recognize the current Warsaw government, but used the phrase "expanding the Warsaw regime, recognized by Britain and the United States," which was an attempt to guarantee the political influence of Britain and the United States in the new Polish government. The current Polish government is called "a country lacking unity" by Roosevelt. Naturally, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, the three "partners," will never know the true meaning of this disunity. When the situation of "division" expands and develops in the post-war international security mechanism, those who pride themselves on being "peace" lovers will re-prepare to use force.</p>
<p>Warsaw Demonstration</p>
<p>On this point, the Polish Liberation Committee and the current Warsaw government, which were supported by the Soviet Union, are naturally very displeasing to Britain and the United States. Just look at what Pance, the former Director of the Mobilization Bureau of the United States, said when he returned to Washington from the Crimean talks to fully illustrate.</p>
<p>"People in the liberated countries who want to seize power must first obtain the support of major powers before they can act, and this tendency is very obvious."</p>
<p>This tendency is particularly obvious in Poland today. In the eyes of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the liberation of Poland itself is not important, but what is important is in what form it is liberated. Churchill reported the decisions of the Yalta Conference in Parliament on February 27. Regarding the "unity" of Poland, he expressed his sad hope.</p>
<p>"Should the independence of the Polish people be preserved? Or should pressure be used, regardless of the will of Poland, to make it a protectorate of the Soviet Union? This is more important than delineating the borders."</p>
<p>Churchill, the Polish government should adopt a "policy friendly to the Soviet Union," and the nature of the regime should be "determined by the general will of the people with the help of the United Nations." The current Warsaw regime does not conform to Churchill's "liking." But the current Warsaw regime strongly protested against the refusal of Poland to participate in the San Francisco Conference, saying that "the London government in exile is an institution that violates the general will of the Polish people," and the next day, the Soviet Union used TASS to support this declaration. Britain and the United States can certainly ignore this declaration, but before the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union will definitely ask Truman's United States to allow the current Warsaw regime to participate in the conference (announced by the U.S. State Department on April 19) to show its determination. The United States' reply to the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>"The United States government absolutely insists that Poland can only be approved to participate in the conference after a new, unified, temporary government is formed in accordance with the Crimean resolution."</p>
<p>European Terror</p>
<p>Several cabinet members of the exiled Polish government have "disappeared" on their way to Moscow to seek compromise. London's position also proves Washington's position. That is to say, if Britain and the United States fully recognize the political character of the Warsaw government, then regarding the political character of France, Yugoslavia, the three Baltic countries, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other European and Balkan countries, they will lose "harmony" with the Soviet Union, and the result will be that the political failure of Britain will be deduced. Therefore, the current Britain and the United States are most afraid of the "countries lacking unity" that are emerging like mushrooms after rain. Only because they foresaw the terror did the "secret agreement" occur in Yalta.</p>
<p>This terror is increasingly strengthening, because the Soviet Union has used the slogan "supporting democracy" against Nazi Germany by Britain and the United States to guarantee the victory of the influence of the Soviet political character. Britain and the United States want to use the democracy they like to overwhelm this Soviet "victory" at the San Francisco Conference, and this is one of the main meanings of the conference. The current Polish question, for the organization of the general will of the world, is a major touchstone of success or failure. This question may be the end of the unnatural "union" between capitalism and Bolshevism, which were united by the common struggle, as shouted by Hitler on the 25th anniversary of the Nazi Party program (February 24).

<h3>Authorities Actively Preparing to Establish Gold Securities Market; Appoint Influential Figures in the Gold Industry to Preside</h3>
<p>After the Central Reserve Bank issued gold securities and the initial listing price was officially set, they went on sale from the 7th of this month until the 9th, and merchants and civilians rushed to buy them, so the sales volume of gold securities was very good. The bank has delivered the quantity of gold securities sold and the equivalent amount of gold reserve to the Gold Securities Issuance Reserve Management Committee for deposit in a special treasury for safekeeping. Once the Management Committee has completed the review and verification of the sales report of the gold securities delivered by the Central Reserve Bank and the reserve gold for redemption, a public announcement will be issued. Regarding the establishment of a gold securities trading market, the relevant authorities are actively preparing and it can be realized in the near future. It is reported that the establishment of the market will designate influential figures with outstanding reputations in the gold industry to preside over it, and the number of brokers and the regulations for their business can be fully determined in the coming days.</p>
<p>Central Reserve Bank Relaxes Cash Position</p>
<p>Due to the shortage of cash on hand, the banking and money industries in the city previously felt difficulties in their business. Almost all receipts and payments with other industries and colleagues were made by negotiable instruments. Therefore, the deposits of colleagues in the Silver Union Money Reserve and the funds transferred for daily clearing were also all negotiable instruments. Therefore, the exchange of negotiable instruments in the money market of the exchange has become particularly busy. According to sources in the banking and money industries: the number of negotiable instruments exchanged by the two industries in April increased by more than one or two times compared to the previous month, and the number also increased frequently at the beginning of this month. However, in the past two or three days, the situation has gradually improved, and the exchange of negotiable instruments has gradually decreased slightly. The reason is that the Central Reserve Bank has relaxed the cash position required by the financial industry.</p>
<h3>Deputy Police Chief Man Inspects Police Reality; Instructs Key Points of Work for Cadres at All Levels</h3>
<p>In order to understand the reality of the improvement of police administration in its subordinate units, Zhou Can, Director of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, specially dispatched Deputy Director Man Qiwei to first inspect the major detachments of the Security Police Corps. Deputy Director Man led Corps Commander Li Jiuxu, Chief Inspector Xing Chongwu, and others to inspect the Second and Third Detachments at 8:00 AM on the 10th, and delivered speeches separately, with the following main points: 1. To strictly abide by the instructions of the concurrent Director and adhere to the police instructions. 2. To strengthen belief and unify will. 3. To strengthen education and strengthen duty. 4. To promote the new spirit of the police and complete the police's mission of the times. After the speech, he inspected internal affairs and inquired about the management, education, and management of cadres at all levels, and instructed on the key points of future work. Deputy Director Man returned to the bureau around 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Gu Senqian Succeeds Director of Municipal Propaganda Office; Liu Dexuan Resigns Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Since taking office in April, Liu Dexuan, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, has been determined to rectify and improve many things. Liu recently suffered a recurrence of his old ailment of palpitations and urgently needs long-term recuperation. He has been granted permission to resign by Mayor Zhou, and Gu Senqian, a city government advisor, has been transferred to succeed him. According to reports, Gu is currently the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Branch of the New National Association and Deputy Commander of the Qing Provincial Youth Corps. The handover between the new and old directors is scheduled for the 15th. In addition, Luo Mixue, the Chief Secretary of the Municipal Government, hosted a farewell party for Director Liu at his official residence at 7:00 PM yesterday, and at the same time welcomed the new Director Gu and invited Chen Bin, Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbai, Lu Feng from the cultural circle, and directors from various bureaus of the Municipal Government to accompany him.

<h3>Zha Shi Succeeds Director of Shanghai Central News Agency</h3>
<p>In order to adjust personnel in its branches, the Central News Agency transferred Zha Shiji, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the head office, to succeed the Director of the Shanghai Branch and temporarily serve as the Editor-in-Chief. Zha came to Shanghai a few days ago to take over.</p>
<h3>Cooking Oil Sources Become Smoother</h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of sources in the past two months, the price of cooking oil in the city has been chaotic. The household oil ration has been suspended for a long time, which has greatly affected the people's food. According to sources in the industry, sea transportation has recently been smooth, and the transportation of cooking oil from northern ports such as Qingdao and northern Jiangsu has gradually become smoother. A large amount of cooking oil has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. It is reported that about 300 loads are transported from Wusong every day, so the city's need for cooking oil is no longer lacking.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau Cracks Down on Illegal Temporary Advertisements</h3>
<p>The city's construction bureau has recently been actively rectifying the management of advertisements, and stipulates that when each business posts temporary advertisements, they should apply to the bureau for approval, pay taxes, and stamp them to comply with the procedures. The bureau has repeatedly announced this to the public. It is learned that while many businesses have complied with the regulations, there are still many violations. Recently, it was learned that the advertisements posted by Dahua Shipping Company, Jiye Transportation Company, Guofeng Society, Aiwen Bookstore, Guangming Grand Theater, Shanghai West Bone Setting Hospital, etc., were all found by the bureau because they had not been approved for tax payment, and were fined separately.</p>
<h3>Commercial Control Council Abolished - Beijing Office</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Council, previously established a Nanjing office at the former site of the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch on Baixia Road in Nanjing due to business needs, in order to facilitate immediate consultation and necessary liaison with the central government and the Materials Review Committee. However, because important work is now mostly concentrated in the Shanghai headquarters for handling, the office appears to have no continued value. The headquarters notified the Nanjing office last week to immediately abolish it.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau - Remittance Volume Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>According to information from the Postal Remittance Bureau: recently, remittance areas have become increasingly smooth, and with low remittance fees, the amount of remittances has also gradually increased.

<h3>Small Newspaper Federation - Officially Established Yesterday - Director Liu of the Propaganda Department Attends and Addresses the Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Small Newspaper Federation held its inaugural meeting at Golden Gate Restaurant at 2 PM on the tenth. Those present included Liu Dexuan, Director of the Propaganda Department, Zhang Yicheng, Director of the News Inspection Office, Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, Huang Min, representative of the Fourth Section of the Police Bureau's Inspection Department, Hu Wenbin, representative of the Cultural Section of the Special High Police, and representatives from major newspapers such as Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbai, Jiang Xiaoguang, Lu Feng, Xiang Jie, as well as representatives from various small newspapers, totaling dozens of people. The meeting commenced on time, with Wang Xuechen designated as the temporary chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: Small newspapers in Shanghai have a considerable history, but in the past, they were like scattered sand, each going its own way with no organization. Today, the establishment of our Small Newspaper Federation can be said to be the most glorious day in the history of small newspapers. The establishment of the assembly has received the guidance and considerable cooperation of Director Liu of the Propaganda Department, for which we are extremely grateful. In the past, small newspapers took small paths; from now on, they should enter the grand avenue. Therefore, we must encourage each other, work together with one heart, and shoulder the mission of the great era to promote culture and lay a permanent foundation for small newspapers. Then, Tang Xiumei, chairman of the preparatory committee, gave a very detailed report on the preparatory process.</p>
<p>Director Liu's Speech</p>
<p>Director Liu Xuan of the Propaganda Department delivered a speech, stating briefly: Today is the day the Small Newspaper Federation is born, and I am very pleased to be able to participate. After I took office on January 16, all parties believed that small newspapers were no longer necessary during wartime and hoped that the government would take them away. At that time, I believed that previously there were more than 30 small newspapers, but after reasonable consolidation by the authorities, there were 14. These 14 have all exhausted their efforts and ability to maintain their position to this day, and it would be a pity to cancel them. Moreover, the position of small newspapers can be improved, so after consultations with all parties, they are still allowed to exist. However, texts promoting indecency and theft will be resolutely banned, and wartime news and current affairs will be published. The style should also be centered on promoting culture. Furthermore, now that the Small Newspaper Federation has been established, it should unite and promote cultural spirit and consider progress. He also reported incidentally that he had been granted permission by Mayor Zhou to resign due to heart disease, and Mr. Gu Senbian would succeed him."</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, then gave a speech, stating briefly: "Small newspapers are softer in content, but their propaganda power may actually be greater than that of so-called major newspapers. Although the content of the member newspapers of the News Federation and the member newspapers of your association is different, they are still in the same industry. The News Federation has been established for two years, and Mr. Xiongbai is also one of the leaders. After the establishment of the federation, the spirit of cooperation among the newspapers in handling affairs can be said to be a record before the incident. Small newspapers also have the necessity of uniting, and everyone's promotion of its establishment has been no small feat. The New Association has recently been handling welfare undertakings for the staff of member newspapers, regardless of employees. Now that your association has been established, it will certainly be able to obtain mutual benefits. In terms of associations, we are all in the same industry, and we can work together both publicly and privately. Today, I express my congratulations on the establishment of your association.</p>
<p>Huang Min of the Inspection Section delivered a speech, saying: "All manuscripts of each newspaper are sometimes inspected, which is due to different standpoints. I hope that each newspaper can be particularly forgiving. Regarding the widespread phenomenon of "literary men despising each other," I hope that at least in small newspapers, it will become a historical term after the establishment of your association today. I hope everyone will not criticize reality and earnestly take on the responsibility of culture, spreading good awareness to the people." Jin Xiongbai, Hu Wenbin, Jiang Xiaoguang, and others then successively delivered speeches, and finally, the constitution was passed, and directors and supervisors were elected.</p>
<p>List of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Wang Xuechen, Tang Xiumei, Hu Xiongfei, Hu Ligeng, Deng Yin first, and Mei Youhan were elected as directors, and Zheng Meitan, Yang Hewen, and Li Quanshi were elected as supervisors. Wang Xuechen was appointed as chairman of the board, and Tang Xiumei and Hu Xiongfei were appointed as managing directors. All directors and supervisors took office under the supervision of Director Liu. The ceremony ended around 3 PM.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Welfare Football Match - Baima Wins Against Qiaolian</h3>
<p>The eighth welfare match, Baima vs. Qiaolian, was performed at the Racecourse Football Field around 5 PM yesterday. There were no less than 10,000 spectators. After a fierce battle, Baima defeated Qiaolian by a score of 3 to 2. After the contact, although Baima was at a disadvantage against the wind, the offensive was very strong, but because it was eager to win, it failed to attack Huanglong directly. Qiaolian turned the tide, and Villa opened a corner kick, which was headed into the red heart by Yato Mali, and Qiaolian took the lead with a score of 1 to 0, opening the record. Baima was unwilling to show weakness, and Sun Laojin went straight in and scored a goal, tying the score at 1 to 1 in the first half. In the midst of the war again, Baima got the help of the wind, and Jia Youliang hooked in from the baseline in 26 minutes, and Mi Laojin displayed his unique skills and succeeded in a volley, taking the lead with a score of 1 to 2. Before long, Sun Laojin scored another hat-trick. Until the end, Zhang Lingen committed a twelve-yard penalty, which was scored by Sila Tiff. Before time ran out, Baima won against Qiaolian by a score of 3 to 2.</p>

<h3>Goods Distribution Office Revises Citizen Certificate Collection Method</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Distribution Office, in order to enable citizens to deeply understand the procedures for applying for distribution certificates, formulated and implemented the Citizen Certificate Collection Instructions last year. However, since the implementation, it has been felt that the original articles are still not perfect in application and need to be revised. After jointly proposing it to the current certificate distribution office director meeting together with the method of handling household registration changes and certificate issuance, it was decided that the office would revise it and submit it to the municipal government for approval and recording. It is now heard that the office has divided the above-mentioned revised instructions and methods into its subordinate distribution offices for compliance, and has also sent letters to the municipal police bureau's Baojia department and relevant agencies for reference and handling. The revised articles are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Certificate Collection Instructions</p>
<p>Any citizen of this city who has one of the following circumstances may apply for a comprehensive distribution certificate: Those who originally lived within the scope of this city; Those who moved in from outside the scope of this city; Those who were newly born in this city.</p>
<p>When citizens of this city apply for distribution certificates, the landlord or his representative should carry various household registration documents on behalf of his family members or his employees (for example, areas such as the first and eighth districts should prepare municipal total donation receipts, Baojia department monthly donation receipts. In districts such as Nanshi Zhabei Xuhuafang Pudong City Center, before the municipal total donation receipts are widely issued, they should apply to each distribution office of this office for distribution certificates for distribution items, transport the certificate and the Fanggongsuo household registration certificate or the police bureau household registration certificate, and present the citizen certificate when necessary.) In accordance with the issuance date announced by the Shanghai Goods Distribution Office, go to the distribution office in each district to collect the distribution certificate.</p>
<p>If the number of applicants for the aforementioned distribution certificate is falsely reported or collected, and the office verifies it to be true, it will be sent to the judicial authority for legal action.</p>
<p>When a citizen moves from District A to District B, he should return the movement certificate issued by the Baojia department and the remaining distribution certificate to the distribution office in District A. The office will issue a certificate return receipt and a movement report certificate, and fill in the return date, number of sheets, and issue number on the back. The Baojia chief and household head of District A will stamp the back of the movement report certificate to prove the move out. When moving to District B, he should purchase an application form for increasing distribution to the distribution office in District B, and have the Baojia chief and household head of District B stamp it for verification. Transport the documents and receipts to the office for approval, and then he can receive the distribution certificate with the same number of sheets and issue number as the certificate returned.</p>
<p>If the population of each district has moved in from outside the scope of this city, or if they are newly born in this city, the household head or landlord or his representative may bring the documents to purchase an application form for increasing the distribution certificate from the distribution office in charge, and hand it over to the Baojia chief and landlord for verification. Together with the move-in light or birth certificate, it will be sent to the distribution office for registration and submitted for approval and allocation.</p>
<p>Citizens who return to their hometowns should present their movement certificate to the original distribution office. In the event of death, the household head or the family members of the deceased should present the death certificate and movement certificate to the original distribution office within a period of one mile.</p>
<p>Civilian schools, public hospitals, church charitable organizations that are exempt from house donations in accordance with the regulations must obtain a tax-free certificate from the Donation Office of the Finance Bureau. Drivers of vehicles and elevator drivers should obtain a certificate from their employers, and they can obtain a non-taxpayer certificate from each distribution office. Fill in the form and submit it to the Baojia chief and his supervisor in charge of the area for verification, and then apply for the issuance of a distribution certificate.</p>
<p>The issuance period for each issue is stipulated as one month. The start and end dates are announced by the office in newspapers. Each distribution office should stipulate the number of households and household numbers to be issued each day within the start and end dates, and issue certificates on a daily basis. The number of households and household numbers to be issued should be announced to the public three days before the issuance date.</p>
<p>After the issuance date of the aforementioned certificate has been announced, each household must apply for the certificate in order. If the certificate is not collected after the deadline, it can only be collected after one month of the issuance period has ended. When re-applying, a late fee of 20 yuan in national currency should be paid for each certificate, and the receipt should be prepared by the distribution office in charge. No re-issuance will be made after the deadline.</p>
<p>After citizens receive the distribution certificate, they should cut off the designated number in the distribution certificate and purchase it from the designated retail store in accordance with the date and the name, quantity, and price of the distribution materials announced by the office.</p>
<p>After citizens receive the distribution certificate, they should keep it properly. In the event of damage or loss, the office will not re-issue or exchange it under any circumstances.</p>
<p>If citizens have any questions about the procedures for applying for certificates, re-issuing certificates, or returning certificates, they may inquire at each distribution office. Staff members of the distribution office wear service badges. If there is any illegal behavior, citizens may find out the staff member's badge number or name and submit evidence to the office for prosecution, but they must not falsely accuse them with malice.</p>
<p>Method of Issuing Certificates for Household Registration Changes</p>
<p>If a citizen moves from District A to District B in this city, he should hand over the household registration movement certificate to apply for increasing the distribution certificate and return the remaining comprehensive distribution certificate to the distribution office in District A. The receipt should be returned to the distribution office in District B. The receipt should be returned to the distribution office in District B.</p>
<p>In addition to making a daily report to the office, the distribution office in District A should also make a receipt for the return. The distribution office in District B should also report the returned receipt to the office together with the movement certificate and the application form for increasing the distribution certificate to make a daily report for approval before the distribution certificate can be exchanged (the form of the receipt for the return of the certificate and the daily report for the issuance of the certificate and the return of the certificate is determined.)</p>
<p>If a citizen encounters death or returns to his hometown, he should return the remaining distribution certificate to the original distribution office and present the movement certificate or death certificate. The office will fill in the receipt for the return of the certificate, make a daily report, and present it to the office for registration together with the distribution certificate. After stamping the receipt with a record seal and returning it, the citizen will hand it over to the police bureau's Baojia department for verification together with the change certificate.</p>
<p>Citizens who move in from outside the city area should submit the application form and the house donation receipt to the distribution office in charge for approval before the distribution certificate can be issued, but each distribution office should issue the entire sheet and should not cut it.</p>
<p>Match Smuggling is Under Investigation</p>
<p>In addition, the Goods Distribution Office has recently received many confidential reports from citizens, all claiming that they were using the 46th Comprehensive Joint Ticket to purchase household distribution matches from designated retailers. They discovered that the retailers often increased the price of the distributed scattered small boxes. Since each retailer has a legal profit, they should not claim to have illegal gains. It is extremely illegal and it is heard that personnel are being sent to investigate secretly in order to punish them severely.</p>

<h3>Flooding on Fanhangdu Road - Please Dredge the Drains</h3>
<p>The terrain in the West Shanghai area is low-lying. Every time it rains heavily, the water accumulates into canals. Especially in the 45th Lane of Fanhangdu Road, the problem is the most serious. In the past, it was limited to the rainy season between June and July. In recent months, even when there is light rain or no rain, water has accumulated to the knees and has not receded for months. Sewage overflows and the stench is unbearable. As summer approaches, it is easy to breed mosquitoes, which has the potential to spread diseases and has a significant impact on public health in the area. Residents of the area have hired experts to inspect it. According to them, the cause of the water accumulation is the siltation of the drains on Fanhangdu Road inside and outside the lane. Therefore, we appeal to the authorities to only dredge the drains to ensure public welfare and maintain hygiene. The entire residents of the area are extremely sincere in praying. (Jiang Changluan, resident of No. 45, Lane Bing, Fanhangdu Road, West Shanghai)</p>
<h3>Mr. Jiutai Donates a Large Sum - To Be Used as Small Loan Funds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Jiutai generously donated 100,000 yuan to be used as small loan funds for the poor. His enthusiasm is commendable. The purpose of small loan funds is to subsidize those who have lost their jobs. Anyone who is engaged in small-scale brokerage and is short of funds or needs to add capital can apply for a loan from the office during office hours with their residence certificate. The procedure is extremely simple. The principal is repaid once a month at a rate of 2%, and it is repaid in ten installments without interest.</p>
<h3>Limited-Price Pork - Profits Used for Charity</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Livestock Industry Pork Retailers Association came to discuss: "Our association, in view of the recent high price of pork in the city, which is not only disrupting the wartime economic structure, but also affecting the foundation of people's livelihood, has been ordered by the authorities to assist the authorities in eradicating illegal black markets. It has also announced in newspapers to its members to report each other and not engage in black market trading. On one hand, it summoned industry insiders to discuss an overall plan, intending to purchase in groups by the association at a limited price and distribute it fairly to benefit the people's livelihood and eliminate the black market. Unexpectedly, after only one day of implementation, it was abandoned halfway due to various obstacles, which is extremely regrettable. After purchasing 19 live pigs (1,150 yuan per kilogram) on the first day of the implementation of group purchases by the association (April 24), in addition to distributing it to each member (in order of registration) at 900 yuan per catty on the 26th, there was still a legal profit of 80,473 yuan. Now, the funds are offered to be used as your newspaper's aid fund for poor children, 40,473 yuan to be transferred, and the remaining 40,000 yuan to be donated to the News Small Loan Fund, I hope you will collect it."</p>
<h3>Learn Boxing to Show Gratitude - Donate to Charity School Funds</h3>
<p>The Yongnian Taijiquan class held by our office is taught voluntarily by Feng Qingchuan and Zhong Wenjun. The reader, Mr. Sun Zhengzhi, yearns for it, but is unable to learn due to work reasons. He wrote to Mr. Chuan, begging to be taught individually on weekends and holidays. He also knows that Mr. Chuan's teaching of boxing is purely voluntary in nature. He is afraid that he will not accept the remuneration, so he attached a check for 20,000 yuan, asking to donate it to the "Charity School Fund" and the Chinese Moral Education Association to create blessings. It was delivered by Mr. Fu yesterday, and he has agreed with Mr. Sun to join the group practice.</p>
<h3>The Fuk Yo Orphanage Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fuk Yo Orphanage held a plenary board meeting yesterday afternoon at the Tian'an Church. More than twenty people, including Wu Yunzhai and Ding Fubao, attended. Chairman Chen Yisheng reported on the progress of the orphanage's affairs, stating roughly: The orphanage was established four years ago, and currently provides shelter for three hundred and fifty-four destitute children. Thanks to the enthusiastic support and generous donations from compassionate and charitable individuals from all walks of life, hundreds of homeless children have been saved from wandering the streets, receiving education and guidance. This not only fills the staff and children with boundless gratitude, but also benefits the society and the nation. Next, Dong Bin reported that the orphanage provides three meals a day, requiring 33 shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice and 140 bags of flour per month, along with cooking oil, salt, vegetables, and fuel, costing approximately seven million yuan per month. Currently, donations are meager, and the orphanage relies entirely on existing food reserves to sustain operations. Accountant Ning Sihong then reported that the orphanage's income and expenditures for last year totaled 8,874,000 yuan. Finally, the board discussed and ratified the appointment of Xu Datong and 29 others as directors and added Lin Kanghou, Zheng Yuan, and Shen Yongkang as executive directors. It was also resolved to streamline the orphanage's operations, economize expenditures, and, in order to adapt to the environment, to comply with the authorities' intention to disperse residents, preparing to move to the countryside and implement a plan for production and education.</p>
