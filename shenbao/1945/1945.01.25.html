<h3>關於收買米糧</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>我住在一個極目四眺上海屋簷盡收入眼底的公寓裏。在我所看到的「上海屋簷下」，大家都在高談闊諭着的，不是「情話連篇」，而是米糧價錢。上海屋簷的起伏波浪盡頭，有浩浩無垠的廣闊平原。現在在這一塊平原上所談論着的，主要也是米糧價錢。屋簷下所談論的與平原上所談諭的，雖同是米糧價錢，然而內容却完全不同。在米糧問題上，從朱像現在這樣一目瞭然地反映着城市與農村的關係。在承平時代，城市總是提供農村以工業品而農村則提供城市以米糧。時至今日，究竟城市在供給農村何種工業品？農村台能收到城市的工業品，自然能提高農業生産效牽，基至生産出雜持農村而又維持城市的食糧。然而今日城市給農村的，除了食不能充饑，衣不能取暖的「堂哉皇哉的政治」外，一無所有。旣不供給工業品，怎能求農村生産效率的提高？生産效率不能提高，連農民本身的生活都難維持，怎能求其雜持城市？</p>
<p>我認爲這就是關於現在所進行的「收買米糧」問題上，我們應當加以考慮的根木問題。假如現在的米糧牧買價格，不够農民塡補購買工業品（如化學肥料等）的錢，那末農村經濟的生產效率怎能提高？從而農民本身生活甚且不能維特，豈能有餘力維持城市人民的生活？如以蠻不講理的强權加在他們頭上，强其所不能，農民則縱春耕秋收，辛勤終年，也不過是爲人作嫁，枵腹從公，而不能藉以茍延殘喘，所以只有望田興嘆，棄耕他往。若當此以往，惡果將不知伊於胡底。就城市與農村的物資交洗原則言，必須注意上述一點，以調整城鄕連接中心的「米糧收買價格」。，關於這事，最近我接到靑浦縣五十五個農民述名簽署的一封信。在此發表，以供當局參考。這決不是矯揉造作的無病呻吟，而是農民內心自然流露的苦悶象徵。更詳細的原文，將印發各有關官所。我熱烈希望當局，傾耳細聽這種農民的哀聲。（靖譯）</p>
<p>吉田先生鑒：敬啓者，茲爲家鄕農民，環請改善徵購米糧，以紓民困而奠邦基，茲特函陳一切，（中略）中國以農立國，農民佔國民什之八，故安定農民生計，即穩定全國民生。國父以「耕者有其田」爲治國之本。今者，民生憔悴，不但不能拼者有其田，甚且耕者不願耕其田，如是影響中國前途，東亞前途，深堪憂慮。欲求東亞和平，中日合作，當先從安定民生入手，然後方能以全力助戰，而操東亞必勝之劵。邇來農民爲微收米糧，受屈萬分，呼籲無門，危害殊甚，茲據調查所得，陳述座右，（中略）事實如左。</p>
<p>（一）每畝耕種成本：（一）　種：每畝一斗约計六百元，（以三十三年五月米價一千元，一斗穀折合六升米計）。（二）肥料：每畝需豆餅三四張，约計一千元（以每石米可換三·四張豆餅計）。（三）人工：每畝约需十三·十四工，约計五千二百元（三十三年五月至十月問每工工資二百元至六百元，平均以四百元一工計）。（四）膳食：以每工對合計算，約計五千二百元。（五）其他材料折損費等：每畝约計二千入百元。（六）捐費：每畝納賦稅约計二百元。合計每畝成木共一萬五千元。</p>
<p>（二）每畝出產額：田有高低肥瘠，稻有早晚，故收履亦不一：（一）最上等田每畝產額约一石五斗。（二）次等田每畝產額约八九斗。（三）劣等田每畝產額约二三斗（低田水田屬之）。</p>
<p>（三）米糧徵購額：（一）去年每畝收六斗，每鄕平均四千担。（二）今年每畝規定收一石六斗，每鄕平均入千六百担。</p>
<p>（四）徵購價格：（一）育浦定折價每石三千八百元（目前糖價每石亦須四千元）。（二）金山縣已增加至每石七千六百元。</p>
<p>綜上情形，農民每畝成本須一萬五千元，每畝收穫至多一石五斗。今徵購額每畝須一石六斗，折價每石祇三千八百元。如此則農民實無以爲生，僉望徵購當局，顧及下情，　予調整微收數額，提高收價，（中略）則農民等自願早日繳淸（目下已徵十分之三，距徵購定額尚遠）吾鄕農民，蒙澤非淺，（下略）。</p>
<h3>日科學陣營動員　積極製造新兵器　中日满協議綜合自給計劃</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　方今科學戰爭下，爲期最後勝利，創造新兵器，已爲日本國民所熱　者。二十四日衆院預算總會開會時，三木武夫關此提山質問，當由技術院總裁八木博士答覆說明如次：（一）特攻隊以必死之精神擊滅敵人，日本科學陣營亦在必死勞力，製造新兵器，已有極大成績。（二）關於科學戰力化，必要之智能動員，科學技術動員，現只作第「次之動員，其未戰力化之智能仍極豐富，此即日本之最大戰力，最大武器。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日小磯首相於二十四日上午衆議院預算總會間，對於三木武夫氏關於中日滿全地域內自給態勢强化之質問，答辯如下：關於中日滿之綜合自給計劃，現農商省正與軍需省與大東亞省協力與中滿當局緊密聯絡協議中。又關於物量不足之點雖多，今後將講求强力之行政措置，企求改善。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日重光大東亞相於二十三日衆議院預算總會席上，對田中貢氏關於大陸物資輸送質問之答辯，大意如次：關於華北物資之收買方而，爲謀中日兩國之協力圓滑起見，現正對戰時之通貨膨脹及物價騰貴等詳加考慮，而研究</p>
<h3>日八六屆議會續開　吾國朝野深致期待</h3>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電　日本入六屆議會前於去年十二月廿七日暫告休會以後，於本月二十一日起，繼續再開，際此大東亞戰爭，已突入最後緊張關頭，日本政府與議會，渾然形成一體，實具有劃期之深切意義，頗堪注目。此次議會，誠可名其爲決戰議會，連日爲議會席上，小磯首相以次重光外相等各大臣，分別演說，闡明日政府應付此次戰階段之決戰施策及外交方針，大東亞十億民族聞訊無不深予重視，一致熱烈期待吾國朝野上下尤爲感舊改善收買機構與方法中。按大陸資源之輸送，因自有其一定限制關係，刻正計劃進行現地戰力化等施策。至於華北滿洲之大陸物資輸送問題，於可能範圍內，皆經由南鮮鐵路輸送方爲適當，對此已着手於朝鮮境內建設雙軌鐵道，現正對去年十二月未完成部分以及內鮮各地之輸送設施，努力加以整備中</p>
<h3>日造船所　成績驚人</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日近截幄造船建造本部，自去歲十月以來，即强方增產民造油槽船，其所管轄之大阪和唯山兵庫各造船所之建造成績，因各工作熱忱，努力動工以來，爲時雖淺，然進展甚速，大體已達目標之四成。僅大阪一地，其松下大海南進港之各造船所，已完成十艘下水，決定本月中即將從事運輸。又去年度之造船計劃，業已完成入成，至三月末即可竣工全目標之數量。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>正吿靑年學生</h3>
<p>一日之計在於晨，一年之計在於春，一生之計在於靑年，而一國之計在於靑年之學生。</p>
<p>「後生可畏，焉知來者之不如今也」，「四十五十而無聞焉，是亦不足畏也矣」，此「畏」字之意議至爲重大。前者包含無限熱烈之期待，而後者包含無限凄凉之情緒。</p>
<p>今日社會之治亂與夫國運之盛衰，早已注定於二三十年前靑年學生之修養，而今日靑年學生之修養又復決定此後二三十年社會之治亂與夫國運之盛義。是故學校乃國家社會之雛型，觀今日學校之內幕與實况，即可斷定將來社會國家之　替消長，無待　筮，無可假借。科舉式之敎育造成麻木不仁之風氣，洋入股式之敎育造成行尸走肉之格調，事有必至，理有固然者。</p>
<p>靑年學生唯一之天職，當然不外乎「求學」。但是爲講求「求學」之效率起見，應注意求學之方法，爲講求「求學」之致用起見，還　注意身心之修養。茲特就此兩者提供大綱，以備我靑年學生之參考：</p>
<p>（一）求學方法　古今學者所指示吾人求學之方法多矣，概括言之可分爲：（甲）橫的方面—在吾人聽課或自修之時，務必做到心口眼手俱到之程度，方不致於「一心以爲鴻鵠將至」而精神散沒思慮糢糊，然後能聽一分鐘課得一分鐘益處，讀一刻鐘書見一刻鐘成績。茍能如此，則在個人方面感覺趣味盎然樂此不疲而進步迅速，同時敎師亦不致有「對牛彈琴」之苦悶而精神煥發，並非敢言「敎不嚴生之惰」，而彼此努力之交互作用實有不可抺煞者，蓋靑年學生之程度與自動力非幼年學童時代所可比擬也。（乙）直的方面—學問之範圍廣泛無垠，學問之本質切忌浮泛。是故博學審問愼思明辨篤行，乃求學步骤上之金科玉律。其所以以博學始而以篤行終者，蓋「知」之用在於「行」，「知」而不「行」何貴乎「知」，由「行」而得之「知」方爲眞「知」，此陽明先生所以倡知行合一之說，而杜紙上談兵之習氣。三人行其中有我師，烏獸蟲魚無一而非學問，至於經世匡時之學，尤當以博學之精神，隨時搜集，再加以審問愼思明辨之整理功夫，使能因地因時之宜，而運用於實際。</p>
<p>（二）身心修養　學問爲物’身心爲器，無　大健全之器，何以容物，海納百川故能成其大，而載舟推行方能顯其用。身心不加以修養，無以吸收學問，其弊爲愚妄。至若學問之成就過於身心之修養，則作奸犯科爲虎添翼，其幣爲狂亂，是猶山洪暴發江河泛濫，田禾湮沒閭閭爲墟。至於身心之修養允貴乎靑年時代之　練，而其着手之道，重在自制。是故仟何宗敎之主旨，先戒除私慾斯後言犧牲而後言濟世，蓋約束之中產生力量，發條不捲緊不能產生遝動，蒸汽不控制何以產生工能，發電者水也而冲刮激蕩爲書者亦水也，其差別在能否约束爲判耳。處今日人欲續洗之世，而言身心修養談何容易，必先立定高尚之志向，採取正確之人生觀，放棄所有一時之利祿，拋却所有一己之幸福，以大我爲前提，以人羣爲對象，然後可與言貧賤不移威武不屈之氣槪，然後可與言身心修養之造詣，然後可與言學以致用之微妙。</p>
<p>茲值歲序更新學期開始之初，願以上列二端，與國內靑年學生共勉之。木報素來重視敎育，除表現於言論外同時求事實上之推進，即以徵募助學金一項而言，亦耶所以不忍坐視靑年失學之苦，而思有以爲扶植國家民族之元氣，勉效微勞，雖承各方面之贊助，未始不稍有成績，然以目前之狀况論，貧乏程度之高以及貧乏範圍之廣，此區區之助學金不足以助其求學而依然屏於學校之外者，則又不知凡幾？因此能納費入學或免費入學或得助學金而入學者，皆天之驕子，難能可貴，同時亦應知所負使命之重大，而更加黽勉警惕。</p>
<h3>日對金本位　決無意恢復　匯兌換算率亦無變更　石渡藏相聲明</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電石渡藏相於二十四日之衆院赤十字委員會席上，答復關於政府有無意見復歸金太位與政府有無意思變更大東亞共榮圈之貨幣換算率兩項之質問稱：金幣在將來貨幣上之使用價值，現在尚不易通觀，同時金幣能否爲國際貨幣，亦非一方可以決定之事，必須考慮對方之國情，始可決定。然而現在不唯日本，即全世界中亦無金而戰爭者，即使戰爭終結，金亦無甚重要性，對於究竟能否以金解決戰爭問題，尤難推測。日本對於大東亞共榮圈內之貿易結算，並無以金爲本位之意向，而以物與物之有機之結算代之，至於大東亞共榮圈內之匯兌換算率須隨之變更，而日本政府現在絕無變更之意思也。</p>

<h3>農業增產會議　昨在京揭幕　各單位報吿工作情形</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　行政院農業增產策進委員會，爲檢討過去工作狀况，聽取各地方報告，並指示本年度工作推進方針起見，特召開各省市農業增產會議。該會議業於二十四日上午在京假實業部舉行，計到有蘇，浙，皖三省京滬兩市晟策策會，及淮海省政府代表，各地區合作社代表，各實騐縣縣長，及合作支社代表，中央有關機關，實業部合作事業委員會，鄕村建設實施委員會代表等，共七十餘人，該會陳委員長親臨主持。十時正大會開始，行禮如儀，旋由主席陳委員長致開會詞，略謂：</p>
<p>今天舉行各省市農業增產會議，承各地代表熱烈參加，不勝感欣，當茲三十四年度增產工作開始之際，召集木會議，實具有極重大之意義。回憶三十三度整個增產工作情形，其主要目標乃在謀取奠定增產工作之基礎，同時對主要農作物如稻。麥。棉。麻，則力謀其產量之增加。綜觀一年來之情形，若干方面實不無相當成果，但全盤觀之，並不能認爲十分滿意。去年度農業增產主要工作，簡言之，約有農村下層機構之組織與技術人員之訓練，灌溉排水工作之促進，稻作耕種技術之改善，棉麻增產役畜之增產，綜括過去以上各大端工作均以發動過遲，主管機構多次更迭，各地淸鄕尚未完成，技術人員缺乏等原因，致未達到全面增產之期望，當此增產工作步入第二年度之初，吾人應深觀檢討過去，糾正已往之缺點，力求以後工作切合實際云云。繼由那須顧問致訓辭：對農村拔術人才之訓練工作，詳爲解釋，語多勉勵。詞畢由該會報告往昔工作狀况，並解釋指示今年之工作計劃，直至十二時始畢，下午三時繼續開會，由出席各　單位相繼報告，均極詳盡，預定今日上午十時繼　討論各項重要議案，該會及各單位之重要報告，及討論各案件，俟大會閉幕後，再行陸續發表。</p>
<h3>危地馬拉　對西絕交</h3>
<p>里斯本廿四日中央社電　德國社訊：危地馬拉政府已與西班牙絕交。</p>
<h3>東普魯士西部　攻防戰激烈　德軍放棄印斯特堡</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德國社訊，軍息：東魯普士西部强大之蘇軍，已再北進至莫倫根與埃爾平之間，該二地已有激戰，該省東部之德軍則與敵解脫，而轉進至馬蘇林湖，並於激戰後，退出印斯特堡（Insterbury）。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：東普魯士南疆戰事稍見緩和，東疆則極激烈，艾勞與阿梭斯坦二地於惡戰之後相繼失守，惟德軍至費里波伏已建立堅強之抵抗。</p>
<p>西里西亞防禦堅强</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫情形目前雖仍極危急，但德軍在全綫各段反攻已漸見成效，當地所能調動之後備軍及人民襲擊隊，皆已開抵前綫迎敵，惟德軍之戰略措施，尚有稍假特日，始能取勝。德軍在上西里西亞工業區與東普魯士南疆之間作戰，乃在蘇軍坦克車先鋒之後方，羅茲與卡里希間戰事尤爲動人，上西里西亞邊境一帶防禦戰獲勝，蘇軍僅在克拉科東南稍獲進展。工業區之東面與北面，今已建就障碍陳地，蘇軍在維斯杜拉迤北向浦洛寗挺進之軍隊已進抵窩赤亞威赫，德軍現正予以堅强抵抗。蘇軍突入波森迤東華塞區迤北之機械化部隊與坦克軍隊，現正與德軍激戰中，該處敵軍自布萊斯勞淮攻托倫與布朗堡，皆艘德軍擊退。</p>
<p>德軍採取賢明策略</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據柏林訊：東錢德軍之防衛，次第强化，但華沙西方正面之蘇軍依然前進。除東普魯士外，大體已進至北起但澤市，南至舊波蘭國境·喀爾巴阡山脈之綫，德方之東綫司令由陸軍參謀總長戈迭里曼上將兼任，作萬全之準備，但在蘇軍開始攻進之後，立即急速後退，殊出一般軍事家之意外，但不可謂此已將兩軍之軍事力之傎實反映。</p>
<p>交戰雙方兵力比較</p>
<p>大凡兩面作戰，無論如何，必須犧牲一面，刻下德軍對手之兵力，西部爲入十師，東部據云僅在喀爾巴阡以北從事正面新攻勢者，即有二百三十師，德軍無疑亦配置有大體相當之兵力。然僅以其兵力之絕對數量，來判定德軍抗戰之重點何在，殊爲不易，有職人士多認爲不外與第一次世界大戰同樣，採取東守西攻之戰略。就德軍當局之立塲言，爲避免被人包圍無睪牺牲而從速後退，自是賢明之策，是故雖遭過大包圍作戰，而德軍之損失甚少。</p>
<h3>西綫德軍　克百餘據點</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：馬奇諾防綫前之美軍戰綫，自於前日崩潰後，德軍已連續克復一百餘處據點。</p>

<h3>整飭本市警政　嚴禁員警索詐　周兼局長召高級員警致訓</h3>
<p>上海特別市警察局周兼局長，昨（廿四）日上午十時半，在該局八樓，召集各正副處長，各正副科長，各正副分局長，警察總隊正副隊長，警察保安隊正副隊長，水上警察總隊正　總隊長等，全級高級員發訓話，周兼局長準時偕同渡正監，　英兩副局長涖臨，即席致訓。大意如下：</p>
<p>蕭整警紀已抱决心</p>
<p>本人此次出任市長兼警察局長，對整頓警政，巳抱最大決心，”爲唯一任務。警察的責任，非常重大，尤其際此戰時狀態，須確切維持地方治安，應直接間接適應戰時體制，協力總力戰，除已身担負此責任外，並須領導民衆，參加總力戰。惟企求達到此項目的，必須健全本身，始能獲得民衆信仰及服從，於是我們應自省本身是否已臻健全，能否取得民衆信仰及服從。查以往時有一般不法員警沿遂值勤警士，任意向民衆藉端勒紫，即使鄉間担柴挑菜之小阪，亦予以攔阻留難，必有所獲而後已，甚至有一般警員調查倉庫商品等，凡一經與民衆接近，無一不先講索賄，在在均已爲與論所指摘，下級有此種不名譽現象存在，幹部亦應認爲名譽之沾，故今後對於肅整綱紀，必須嚴切注意。本局組織複雜，人員爲舊一二三局所合併，其中有曾供職前公共租界或法租界者，現旣經合併，而巳成爲一警政完成統一之警察局，希望此種人員，應放棄以前租界觀念。以前租界當局，對民衆甚爲輕視，華籍員警均係僱傭性質，惟現在情形已非昔比，外籍警員須知木身已爲中國警察官吏，而爲政府之公務人員，故須認淸自己責任，發揮警察精神。本局現有日籍人員甚多，我們應於汪故主席「同生共死」的精神下，中日人員密切合作，盡力警察工作，我們能盡職，就是對於政府忠實，本局之華籍人員能盡職，是對中國政府盡忠，日籍人員能盡其職，就是對日本政府盡忠，務望全體警員，努力木位工作，各盡其職，完成警察任務。</p>
<p>下月開始改善待遇</p>
<p>惟在肅整綱紀時，記者以警員待遇菲董爲　，故決定於二月一日起，對員警待遇當予改善，食米之配給自彼時起免費發配，每人至少可得三斗，薪餉亦將酌量增加，同時對警察消費社，亦予擴充，增加資本一萬萬元，盡量强化採辦配給工作，對各種日用必需品均極力設法配給，以安定警察生活，將來並準備對正副處長，正副分局長，正副科長等發給機密費或辦公費等，以資津貼，故以後警察絕對不得再有向民衆留難索賄情事，否則一經查實，絕不容情，從嚴懲處。同時傳聞各分局中竟有巡捕公司之組織，此類不法組織，應予立刻停止，不得再行存在，督察處須加强督飭查察工作，對不法員警，當予檢舉查辦，俾成眞正光榮之警察。</p>
<p>調整機構增加效率</p>
<p>其次本局自二月一日起，對機構要大加改善，使之簡單化，編制及名額務期劃一，權力要使之集中於分局長，處長不得發令於各股主任，處長可對分局長指導與監督，但須命令時，應以局長名義。惟分局長權力旣大，責任亦重大，故希望各分局攘均須以身作則，爲部下模範。現在公文傳遞非常遲鈍，從下一紙公文，經過許多周折，費了幾天工夫，始能完畢，此等現象，非戰時的機構所應有，故辦事應簡單明晰敏捷，機構的善備，工作效率亦得增加。」</p>
<p>周兼局長最後又述及，本風期中，沿途崗警對人民勒索之風，已見减少，恢復人民對警察信仰甚鉅，務望這稱現象，永久維持下去，並求進展，各分局長回去後須對部下完全說明，務使每一警員長官，明瞭本身概守及責任。周氏訓話旣畢，復召開各處長舉行局務會議，對警政推進之政策，商討甚爲詳密。</p>
<h3>市財政當局　積極整頓稅收　嚴防逃稅中飽</h3>
<p>上海特別市政府財政局，自羅秘書長兼任局長以來，對本市稅收整頓不遺餘力，刻正分別研究，縝密施策，務期達到澦期目標。昨（二十四）日據該局負賣人談，該局頃決定二項重要原則，積極實施。（一）剔除中飽，澄淸積弊。（二）在不增加人民納稅負擔之原則下，按照實際情况，酌量調整稅率。（三）防止納稅人之非法逃稅，如過去一般旅館，戲院，游藝塲所，飲食店，及其他商店等所繳納捐稅，僅爲應繳納數額之十分之一二，其中少數爲征收員之舞弊中飽，惟大多數稅款悉爲納稅人取巧逃避。查以往政府遭受此種損失違百分之七十以上，其數殊足驚人，該局刻正下最大決心防止此種逃稅，澦料非法奸商及貪污人員，定將遭遇迎頭之打擊。</p>
<h3>宣傳處續如集　戲劇界懇談</h3>
<p>市宣傳處昨（二十四）日下午二時半，在該處會議廳繼續召集本市戲劇甲曲及雜劇等負責人三十餘名，舉行懇談，首由劉處長闡述戲劇爲通俗化宜傳工具，攸關國家文化興袞至鉅，目前滬市民氣消沉，嗣後希望能多上演振奮民氣之劇本，以協力戰時宣傳工作，嗣即述說以往宣傳處之弊端，此後決予糾正，不准再有賄賂需索等情事發生，幷盼各界隨時發現有上述情形，應即檢舉，否則一經查實，當以同科論。關於宣傳處今後一切工作，決秉公及依照法規辦理，各界隨時予以協助，則公私厚幸。聞本市戲劇界方面，對劉處長此種廉潔態度，與苦幹精神，極表欽佩。</p>
<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>留學金委員會決議　本屆學生助金限額　照上屆增加一倍半　不敷之數繼續勸募</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金委員會，昨日開會討諭本屆助金支配問題。據各校報告，下學期學費，約比上學期增加百分之二百至四百，而目前所有捐款，尚不滿二千二百萬元，比上曆核發助金總數一千四百餘萬，僅增加百分之五六十，故本屆助金之支配非常困難。大量減少學生，旣非辦法，每人助金過低，又無補於事。經再三討論之後，決議本屆各級學生之助金限額，照上屆增加百分之一百五十，即高小每人五千元，初中每人七千五百元，高中每人一萬元，大學每人一萬五千元。預算目下捐款，尚缺一千萬元。但多數學校日內即將開學，故決定除高小學生助金可一次發給外，其餘只能先發一部份，計初中六千，高中七千五百，大學一萬，餘數尚需繼續勸募，希望於三月中可以發出。至於原有學生，除少數自動輟學及在校成績不及標準者外，決予繼續補助。</p>

<p>我們一方面佩服聞老先生說到做到的精神，一方面希望一般人效法這種精神，使社會上形成澈底的節約風氣。</p>

<p>—Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>I live in an apartment with a panoramic view, where the rooftops of Shanghai are fully visible. Under the "Shanghai rooftops" that I see, everyone is talking animatedly, not about "sweet nothings," but about the price of rice. At the end of the undulating waves of Shanghai rooftops lies a vast and boundless plain. Now, on this plain, the main topic of discussion is also the price of rice. Although both the conversations under the rooftops and the discussions on the plain are about the price of rice, the content is completely different. The relationship between the city and the countryside is now clearly reflected in the rice issue. In peacetime, the city always provided the countryside with industrial products, and the countryside provided the city with rice. But what kind of industrial products is the city supplying the countryside today? If the countryside can receive the city's industrial products, it can naturally improve agricultural production efficiency and even produce food that sustains both the countryside and the city. However, today, the city gives the countryside nothing but "grand and majestic politics" that cannot fill the stomach or provide warmth. If it doesn't supply industrial products, how can it demand an improvement in agricultural production efficiency? If production efficiency cannot be improved, and even the lives of the farmers themselves are difficult to maintain, how can it expect them to sustain the city?</p>
<p>I believe that this is the fundamental problem that we should consider regarding the current "purchase of rice." If the current rice purchase price is not enough for farmers to cover the cost of purchasing industrial products (such as chemical fertilizers), how can the production efficiency of the rural economy be improved? As a result, the farmers themselves cannot even maintain their livelihoods, how can they have the surplus to sustain the lives of the city people? If unreasonable force is imposed on them, demanding what they cannot provide, then the farmers, despite their hard work from spring plowing to autumn harvest, will only be working for others, going hungry for the public, and unable to even survive. Therefore, they can only sigh at the fields and abandon farming to go elsewhere. If this continues, the dire consequences will be unimaginable. In terms of the principle of material exchange between the city and the countryside, it is necessary to pay attention to the above point in order to adjust the "rice purchase price" at the connecting center between urban and rural areas. Regarding this matter, I recently received a letter signed by 55 farmers from Qingpu County. I am publishing it here for the authorities to refer to. This is by no means artificial and affected groaning, but a symbol of the natural expression of the farmers' inner suffering. A more detailed original will be issued to the relevant government offices. I earnestly hope that the authorities will listen carefully to the cries of these farmers. (Translated by Jing)</p>
<p>To Mr. Yoshida: We, the farmers of our hometown, respectfully request the improvement of the rice requisition in order to alleviate the people's suffering and lay the foundation for the country. We are hereby submitting everything in writing (omitted). China is founded on agriculture, and farmers account for eight out of ten of the population. Therefore, stabilizing the livelihoods of the farmers is to stabilize the national livelihood. The Founding Father took "land to the tiller" as the foundation for governing the country. Today, the people's livelihood is withered, and not only can the tiller not have land, but even the tiller is unwilling to till the land. This affects the future of China and the future of East Asia, which is deeply worrying. If we want peace in East Asia and cooperation between China and Japan, we must first start with stabilizing the people's livelihood, and then we can devote all our efforts to helping in the war and securing the victory of East Asia. Recently, the farmers have suffered greatly in exchange for the meager rice revenue, and there is no way to appeal, causing great harm. Based on the survey results, we present our thoughts (omitted). The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cost of Cultivation per Mu: (1) Seeds: approximately 600 yuan per mu (based on the rice price of 1,000 yuan in May of the 33rd year of the Republic, with 1 dou of grain equivalent to 6 sheng of rice). (2) Fertilizer: 3-4 bean cakes are needed per mu, approximately 1,000 yuan (based on 1 shi of rice being able to exchange for 3-4 bean cakes). (3) Labor: approximately 13-14 laborers are needed per mu, approximately 5,200 yuan (from May to October of the 33rd year of the Republic, the wage per laborer was from 200 to 600 yuan, averaging 400 yuan per laborer). (4) Food: calculated proportionally per laborer, approximately 5,200 yuan. (5) Other material depreciation costs, etc.: approximately 2,800 yuan per mu. (6) Taxes: approximately 200 yuan of taxes are paid per mu. Total cost per mu is 15,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Production Volume per Mu: Fields vary in quality and fertility, and rice varies in type, so the harvest is also different: (1) Top-grade fields produce approximately 1.5 shi per mu. (2) Second-grade fields produce approximately 8-9 dou per mu. (3) Inferior fields produce approximately 2-3 dou per mu (belonging to low-lying and paddy fields).</p>
<p>(3) Rice Requisition Amount: (1) Last year, 6 dou were collected per mu, with an average of 4,000 dan per township. (2) This year, the regulation is to collect 1.6 shi per mu, with an average of 8,600 dan per township.</p>
<p>(4) Requisition Price: (1) Qingpu's fixed discount price is 3,800 yuan per shi (currently the price of sugar is also 4,000 yuan per shi). (2) Jinshan County has increased to 7,600 yuan per shi.</p>
<p>In summary, the cost per mu for farmers is 15,000 yuan, and the maximum harvest per mu is 1.5 shi. Now, the requisition amount is 1.6 shi per mu, and the discount price is only 3,800 yuan per shi. In this way, the farmers have no means of survival. We all hope that the requisition authorities will take into account the situation below and adjust the requisition amount and increase the purchase price (omitted), then the farmers, etc., will voluntarily pay it off as soon as possible (currently three-tenths have been collected, far from the fixed requisition amount). The farmers in our hometown will be deeply grateful (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Japanese Science Ranks Mobilize: Actively Manufacturing New Weapons; Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Agreement on Comprehensive Self-Sufficiency Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) In the current era of scientific warfare, in order to achieve final victory, the creation of new weapons has become a matter of great enthusiasm for the Japanese people. When Takeo Miki raised questions about this at the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the 24th, Dr. Yagi, President of the Technology Institute, responded as follows: (1) The special attack units destroy the enemy with a spirit of certain death, and the Japanese scientific ranks are also working with a certain death spirit to manufacture new weapons, with great achievements. (2) Regarding the war-fighting of science, the necessary intellectual mobilization and scientific and technological mobilization, only the first mobilization has been carried out. There is still extremely rich intelligence that has not been war-fighted. This is Japan's greatest war fighting power and greatest weapon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, at the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 24th, answered the questions raised by Mr. Takeo Miki regarding the strengthening of the self-sufficiency system in the entire Sino-Japanese-Manchurian region as follows: Regarding the comprehensive self-sufficiency plan for China, Japan, and Manchuria, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is currently cooperating with the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Greater East Asia, and is in close contact and consultation with the authorities of China and Manchuria. Although there are many points of insufficient material quantities, we will strive to improve them through strong administrative measures in the future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, at the Budget Committee meeting of the House of Representatives on the 23rd, answered the questions raised by Mr. Ko Tanaka regarding the transportation of materials in the continent, with the gist as follows: Regarding the purchase of materials in North China, in order to promote smooth cooperation between China and Japan, we are currently carefully considering the wartime inflation and rising prices, and studying improvement of the purchasing organization and methods. Regarding the transportation of resources from the continent, because there are certain restrictions, we are planning to carry out measures such as local war-fighting. As for the transportation of continental materials in North China and Manchuria, it is appropriate to transport them through the South Korean Railway to the extent possible. We have already started constructing a double-track railway within Korea, and we are working hard to improve the transportation facilities in the parts not completed in December of last year and in various parts of Korea.</p>
<h3>The 86th Session of the Japanese Diet Continues: Our Country's Government and Public Place Deep Expectations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The 86th session of the Japanese Diet, after temporarily adjourning on December 27th of last year, resumed on the 21st of this month. At this time, when the Greater East Asia War has entered the final tense stage, the Japanese government and the Diet have formed a unified whole, which has profound and epoch-making significance and is worthy of attention. This Diet can truly be called the decisive battle Diet. On consecutive days, Prime Minister Koiso and other ministers, such as Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, delivered speeches on the Diet floor, elaborating on the Japanese government's decisive battle strategies and diplomatic policies to cope with this war stage. The 1 billion people of Greater East Asia have all attached great importance to the news and unanimously and enthusiastically expect that the government and public of our country will improve the purchasing mechanism and method.</p>
<h3>Remarkable Achievements of Japanese Shipyards</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Shipbuilding Construction Headquarters has been strongly increasing the production of civilian oil tankers since October of last year. The construction achievements of the shipyards under its jurisdiction in Osaka, Kure, and Hyogo have progressed rapidly due to the enthusiasm and hard work of the workers, although the time is short. In general, 40% of the target has been achieved. In Osaka alone, the shipyards of Matsushita Daikai, Nanko, and other shipyards have completed the launching of ten ships and have decided to start transportation this month. Furthermore, the shipbuilding plan for the past year has already been completed by 80%, and the entire target quantity will be completed by the end of March.</p>

<h3>A Sincere Announcement to Young Students</h3>
<p>The plan for a day lies in the morning, the plan for a year lies in the spring, the plan for a lifetime lies in youth, and the plan for a country lies in the young students.</p>
<p>"The younger generation is to be regarded with respect; how can we know that those who come after us will not surpass us?" "If a man does not make himself heard of till forty or fifty, he will not be regarded with any respect," the meaning of this word "respect" is extremely important. The former contains boundless enthusiastic expectations, while the latter contains boundless desolate emotions.</p>
<p>The order or chaos of today's society and the prosperity or decline of the national destiny were long ago destined by the cultivation of young students twenty or thirty years ago, and the cultivation of today's young students again determines the order or chaos of society and the prosperity or decline of the national destiny in the next twenty or thirty years. Therefore, the school is the prototype of the country and society. Observing the inside story and the reality of today's schools, one can determine the rise and fall of the future society and country without divination and without ambiguity. The education of the imperial examination style creates a numb and indifferent atmosphere, and the education of the foreign joint-stock style creates the style of walking corpses. There are inevitable things, and there are inherent reasons.</p>
<p>The only natural duty of young students is of course nothing more than "studying." However, in order to emphasize the efficiency of "studying," attention should be paid to the method of studying. In order to emphasize the practical application of "studying," attention should also be paid to the cultivation of body and mind. Here, I provide an outline of these two points for the reference of my young students:</p>
<p>(1) Methods of Studying: Scholars of ancient and modern times have instructed us on many methods of studying. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into: (A) Horizontal aspect - when we are listening to lectures or self-studying, we must do our best to ensure that the mind, mouth, eyes, and hands are all in place, so as not to "think of swans coming at the same time" and scatter our spirit and blur our thoughts. Only then can we gain a minute of benefit from listening to a minute of class and see a minute of achievement from reading a quarter of an hour of books. If we can do this, then on a personal level, we will feel full of interest, enjoy it, and make rapid progress. At the same time, teachers will not have the suffering of "playing the lute to a cow" and will be full of energy. I dare not say that "the teacher is not strict and the student is lazy," but the interaction of mutual efforts is indeed undeniable, because the level and autonomy of young students are not comparable to those of young children. (B) Vertical aspect - the scope of knowledge is vast and boundless, and the essence of knowledge should not be superficial. Therefore, extensive learning, careful questioning, prudent thinking, clear discrimination, and resolute practice are the golden rules in the steps of studying. The reason why extensive learning begins and resolute practice ends is that the use of "knowledge" lies in "action." What is the value of "knowledge" without "action"? The "knowledge" gained through "action" is true "knowledge." This is why Mr. Yangming advocated the theory of the unity of knowledge and action and eradicated the habit of empty talk on paper. Among three men walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher. There is nothing in birds, beasts, insects, and fish that is not learning. As for the learning of managing the world and rectifying the times, we should especially collect it at any time with the spirit of extensive learning, and then add the organizational work of careful questioning, prudent thinking, and clear discrimination, so that it can be applied to practice according to the time and place.</p>
<p>(2) Cultivation of Body and Mind: Learning is a thing; body and mind are vessels. Without a sound vessel, how can things be contained? The sea can accommodate hundreds of rivers, so it can become great, and only by carrying a boat and pushing it forward can its use be shown. If the body and mind are not cultivated, there is no way to absorb knowledge, and the disadvantage is ignorance. As for the achievement of learning exceeding the cultivation of body and mind, it is like adding wings to a tiger to do evil and commit crimes, and the disadvantage is madness. It is like a mountain flood breaking out and rivers overflowing, with fields and villages submerged. As for the cultivation of body and mind, it should be valued in the training of youth, and the way to start it lies in self-control. Therefore, the main purpose of any religion is to first remove selfish desires, and then speak of sacrifice, and then speak of saving the world. The power is generated in restraint, the spring cannot produce movement if it is not wound tightly, and how can steam produce work if it is not controlled? The generator is water, and the water that scrapes and washes is also the book. The difference lies in whether it can be constrained as a judgment. In today's world of escalating human desires, how easy is it to talk about the cultivation of body and mind? We must first establish lofty ambitions, adopt a correct outlook on life, abandon all temporary gains and losses, abandon all personal happiness, take the big ego as the premise, and take the group as the object. Then we can talk about the integrity of not being moved by poverty and humbleness or subdued by power, then we can talk about the attainment of the cultivation of body and mind, and then we can talk about the subtlety of using learning.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new year and the start of the new semester, I would like to encourage the young students in the country with the above two points. This newspaper has always attached importance to education, and in addition to expressing it in words, we also seek to promote it in reality. Taking the fundraising of student aid funds as an example, we cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the suffering of young people dropping out of school, and think of supporting the vitality of the country and the nation, and strive to make humble contributions. Although we have received support from all aspects, it is not without some achievements. However, considering the current situation, the high degree of poverty and the wide range of poverty, this small amount of student aid funds is not enough to help them study and they are still excluded from schools. Then, how many are there that we do not know? Therefore, those who can pay for admission, or get free admission, or get student aid funds and enter school are all children of heaven, rare and valuable, and at the same time, they should also know the greatness of the mission they bear and be more diligent and vigilant.</p>
<h3>Japan Has No Intention of Returning to the Gold Standard; Exchange Rates Will Not Change Either: Statement by Finance Minister Ishiwatari</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) At the meeting of the House of Representatives Red Cross Committee on the 24th, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, in response to questions on whether the government had any intention of returning to the gold standard and whether the government had any intention of changing the currency exchange rate of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, said: "It is not easy to see the future use value of gold coins in the future currency at present, and whether gold coins can become an international currency cannot be decided by one party alone. We must consider the national conditions of the other party before we can decide. However, at present, not only Japan, but the whole world is also at war without gold. Even if the war ends, gold will not be very important, and it is difficult to predict whether the problem of war can be solved with gold. Japan has no intention of using gold as the standard for trade settlement within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but will replace it with organic settlement of goods and goods. As for the exchange rate of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it must be changed accordingly, but the Japanese government has absolutely no intention of changing it at present."</p>

<h3>Agricultural Production Conference Opens in Beijing Yesterday: Units Report on Work Progress</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Promotion Committee, in order to review past work conditions, hear reports from various localities, and provide guidance for this year's work promotion direction, has specially convened a conference on agricultural production for various provinces and cities. The conference was held on the morning of the 24th at the Ministry of Industry in Beijing, attended by representatives from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the Shanghai and Nanjing municipalities, the Promotion Committee, the Huaihai Provincial Government, cooperative representatives from various regions, county magistrates from experimental counties, representatives from cooperative branches, relevant central agencies, the Cooperative Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Industry, and representatives from the Rural Construction Implementation Committee, totaling more than 70 people. Chairman Chen of the committee personally presided over the meeting. The conference began at exactly 10:00 a.m. with customary formalities. Chairman Chen then delivered an opening speech, stating in brief:</p>
<p>"Today, we are holding the Agricultural Production Conference for various provinces and cities, and I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic participation of representatives from various regions. At the start of the thirty-fourth year's production increase work, convening this conference is of great significance. Looking back at the overall situation of the thirty-third year's production increase work, the main goal was to lay the foundation for production increase work, while striving to increase the output of major crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, and hemp. Reviewing the situation of the past year, there have indeed been considerable achievements in some aspects, but overall, we cannot consider it entirely satisfactory. In brief, the main tasks of agricultural production increase last year included the organization of grassroots rural institutions and the training of technical personnel, the promotion of irrigation and drainage work, the improvement of rice cultivation techniques, the increase of cotton and hemp production, and the increase of livestock. In summary, the reason why the above major tasks did not achieve the expectation of comprehensive production increase was due to reasons such as the late initiation of the tasks, multiple changes of the responsible agencies, the incomplete completion of land clearing in various regions, and the lack of technical personnel. As the production increase work enters the beginning of its second year, we should deeply review the past, correct the shortcomings of the past, and strive to make future work more practical," and so on. Subsequently, Advisor Nasu delivered a speech of instruction, providing a detailed explanation of the training of technical talents in rural areas, with many words of encouragement. After the speech, the committee reported on past work conditions and explained and instructed on this year's work plan, which lasted until 12:00 noon. The meeting continued at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon, with successive reports from various attending units, all of which were extremely detailed. It is scheduled that various important motions will be discussed starting at 10:00 a.m. today. The important reports of the committee and various units, as well as the discussion of various cases, will be released successively after the closing of the conference.</p>
<h3>Guatemala Severs Diplomatic Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports: The government of Guatemala has severed diplomatic relations with Spain.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Western East Prussia: German Army Abandons Insterburg</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports, military news: The powerful Soviet army in western East Prussia has advanced further north to between Mohrungen and Elbing, where fierce fighting has taken place. The German army in the eastern part of the province has disengaged from the enemy and retreated to the Masurian Lakes, and after fierce fighting, withdrew from Insterburg.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News Agency reports: The fighting on the southern border of East Prussia has eased slightly, while the fighting on the eastern border is extremely fierce. Allenstein and Soldau fell successively after fierce battles, but the German army has established a strong resistance at Friedland.</p>
<p>Strong Defense in Silesia</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News Agency reports: Although the situation on the Eastern Front is still extremely critical, the German army's counterattacks on various sections of the entire line have gradually become effective. The reserve forces and people's assault teams that can be mobilized locally have all arrived at the front line to meet the enemy. However, it will take some time for the German army's strategic measures to be effective. The German army is fighting in the industrial area of Upper Silesia and the southern border of East Prussia, behind the vanguard of Soviet tanks. The fighting between Lodz and Kalisz is particularly moving. The defensive battle on the border of Upper Silesia was won, and the Soviet army only made some progress southeast of Krakow. Obstacles have now been built to the east and north of the industrial area. The Soviet army advancing northward to Płock north of the Vistula has reached Wocłaviavich. The German army is now putting up a strong resistance. The mechanized units and tank armies of the Soviet army that broke into the Hasek area north of Breslau east of Posen are now engaged in fierce fighting with the German army. The enemy troops attempting to attack Toruń and Bromberg from Breslau have all been repelled by the German army.</p>
<p>German Army Adopts Wise Strategy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Berlin: The defense of the German army on the Eastern Front is gradually being strengthened, but the Soviet army on the western front of Warsaw is still advancing. In general, except for East Prussia, they have advanced to a line from Danzig in the north to the old Polish border and the Carpathian Mountains in the south. The Eastern Front commander of the German side is concurrently held by General Guderian, Chief of the Army General Staff, to make full preparations. However, immediately retreating rapidly after the Soviet army began to attack was unexpected by general military experts, but it cannot be said that this has not reflected the reality of the military strength of the two armies.</p>
<p>Comparison of Military Strength of Both Sides</p>
<p>In general, in a two-front war, one side must be sacrificed, no matter what. Currently, the German army's opponents have seventy divisions on the Western Front, and it is said that there are as many as 230 divisions engaged in a new frontal offensive north of the Carpathians on the Eastern Front. The German army undoubtedly also has a roughly equivalent force deployed. However, it is not easy to determine where the German army's focus of resistance lies based solely on the absolute number of its troops. Many knowledgeable people believe that it is nothing more than adopting the same strategy as in the First World War: defending in the east and attacking in the west. From the standpoint of the German authorities, it is a wise strategy to retreat quickly to avoid being surrounded and sacrificing needlessly. Therefore, although they suffered a major encirclement operation, the German army suffered very few losses.</p>
<h3>German Army on the Western Front Recaptures Over a Hundred Strongholds</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News Agency reports: Since the collapse of the American front line in front of the Maginot Line the day before yesterday, the German army has successively recaptured over a hundred strongholds.</p>

<h3>Reorganizing Municipal Police Affairs: Strictly Prohibiting Police Extortion: Concurrent Director Zhou Calls Senior Police Officers for Instruction</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau Concurrent Director Zhou, yesterday (24th) at 10:30 a.m., convened all deputy directors, section chiefs, deputy section chiefs, branch chiefs, deputy branch chiefs, police corps commanders, deputy police corps commanders, police security team commanders, deputy police security team commanders, water police corps commanders, and deputy corps commanders, etc., all levels of senior officers to issue instructions. Concurrent Director Zhou arrived on time with Deputy Directors Du and Ying and delivered instructions. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolved to Straighten Out Police Discipline</p>
<p>"This time I have taken office as Mayor and Concurrent Police Bureau Director, and I am determined to straighten out police affairs. The responsibility of the police is very heavy, especially in this time of war, it is necessary to maintain local security and adapt directly and indirectly to the wartime system, and cooperate with the total war effort. In addition to bearing this responsibility ourselves, we must also lead the public to participate in the total war effort. However, in order to achieve this goal, we must first be sound ourselves in order to gain public trust and obedience. Therefore, we should ask ourselves whether we have achieved soundness and whether we can gain public trust and obedience. In the past, there have often been illegal police officers who arbitrarily extorted money from the public on duty, even stopping and harassing small vendors carrying firewood and vegetables in the countryside, and only letting them go after receiving something. There have even been police officers who demand bribes whenever they inspect warehouses and goods, and all of these have been criticized by public opinion. If such dishonorable phenomena exist at the lower levels, the cadres should also feel ashamed. Therefore, in the future, we must pay close attention to straightening out discipline. The organization of this bureau is complex, and the personnel are merged from the old first, second, and third bureaus. Among them, there are those who have served in the former International Settlement or French Concession. Now that they have been merged and become a police bureau with complete unified police affairs, I hope that these personnel will abandon the previous settlement concepts. In the past, the settlement authorities were very contemptuous of the public, and Chinese police officers were merely employees. However, the current situation is no longer the same. Foreign police officers must know that they are now Chinese police officials and public servants of the government. Therefore, they must recognize their own responsibilities and demonstrate the spirit of the police. There are currently many Japanese personnel in this bureau. We should closely cooperate in the spirit of Chairman Wang Jingwei's 'sharing life and death,' and do our best in police work. If we can do our duty, we are loyal to the government. If the Chinese personnel of this bureau can do their duty, they are loyal to the Chinese government. If the Japanese personnel can do their duty, they are loyal to the Japanese government. I hope that all police officers will work hard in their respective positions, do their duty, and complete the police mission."</p>
<p>Improved Treatment to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>"However, while straightening out discipline, I am aware that police officers' treatment is meager. Therefore, it has been decided that starting from February 1st, police officers' treatment will be improved. The allocation of rice will be distributed free of charge from that time on, with each person receiving at least three dou. Salaries will also be increased appropriately. At the same time, the police consumer cooperative will be expanded, increasing its capital by 100 million yuan, and efforts will be made to strengthen purchasing and allocation work, and efforts will be made to allocate various daily necessities to stabilize the lives of the police. In the future, it is also planned to issue confidential funds or office expenses to deputy directors, deputy branch chiefs, deputy section chiefs, etc., to provide subsidies. Therefore, in the future, the police must absolutely not harass or extort money from the public. Otherwise, once verified, they will not be tolerated and will be severely punished. At the same time, there are rumors that there are patrolman companies in various branches. Such illegal organizations should be stopped immediately and must not exist again. The inspection office must strengthen supervision and inspection work, and report and investigate illegal police officers to become truly glorious police."</p>
<p>Adjusting the Structure to Increase Efficiency</p>
<p>"Secondly, starting from February 1st, this bureau will greatly improve its structure, simplifying it. The staffing and quotas should be unified, and the power should be concentrated in the branch chiefs. The directors should not issue orders to the section chiefs. The directors can guide and supervise the branch chiefs, but when orders are necessary, they should be issued in the name of the bureau director. However, with greater power comes greater responsibility for the branch chiefs. Therefore, I hope that all branch chiefs will lead by example and be a model for their subordinates. Currently, the transmission of official documents is very slow. A single document goes through many twists and turns, taking several days to complete. Such phenomena are not what a wartime organization should have. Therefore, work should be simple, clear, and agile. With a well-equipped structure, work efficiency can also be increased."</p>
<p>Concurrent Director Zhou finally mentioned that the practice of roadside police extorting money from the people has decreased during this period, greatly restoring the people's faith in the police. He hoped that this phenomenon would be maintained and further developed. The branch chiefs must fully explain to their subordinates after returning, so that every police officer and officer can understand their own duties and responsibilities. After Zhou's instructions were completed, a bureau affairs meeting was convened with the directors of each department to discuss the policy of promoting police affairs in great detail.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Authorities Actively Rectify Tax Revenue: Strictly Preventing Tax Evasion and Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Since Secretary-General Luo concurrently took office as Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau, he has made unremitting efforts to rectify the city's tax revenue, and is currently conducting separate studies and implementing meticulous policies to achieve the expected goals. Yesterday (24th), according to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau recently decided on two important principles to be actively implemented: (1) Eliminate embezzlement and clarify accumulated malpractices. (2) Under the principle of not increasing the tax burden on the people, adjust the tax rates appropriately according to the actual situation. (3) Prevent taxpayers from illegally evading taxes. For example, the taxes paid by general hotels, theaters, amusement venues, restaurants, and other shops in the past were only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the amount that should have been paid. Some of this was embezzlement by collection staff, but most of the tax revenue was evaded by taxpayers through trickery. In the past, the government suffered more than 70% of such losses, and the amount was shocking. The bureau is currently determined to prevent this kind of tax evasion, and it is expected that illegal profiteers and corrupt officials will encounter a head-on blow.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Department Continues to Convene: Informal Talks with the Theater Community</h3>
<p>Yesterday (24th) at 2:30 p.m., the Municipal Propaganda Department continued to convene more than 30 persons in charge of theater, opera, and variety shows in the city at the department's conference hall for informal talks. Director Liu first expounded that theater is a popular propaganda tool, which is crucial to the prosperity of national culture. Currently, the morale of the Shanghai people is depressed, and it is hoped that more plays that boost morale will be staged in the future to cooperate with wartime propaganda work. Then, he talked about the shortcomings of the Propaganda Department in the past, and decided to correct them in the future, and not allow bribery or extortion to occur again. He also hoped that all sectors would report any of the above situations as soon as they are discovered, otherwise, once verified, they will be treated as the same offense. Regarding all the work of the Propaganda Department in the future, it will be handled impartially and in accordance with laws and regulations. With the assistance of all sectors at any time, it will be fortunate for both public and private interests. It is reported that the theater community in the city greatly admires Director Liu's integrity and hard work.</p>

<h3>Scholarship Committee Decides: This Year's Student Scholarship Limit: Increased by One and a Half Times Compared to Last Year: Continued Fundraising for the Shortfall</h3>
<p>The newspaper's Reader Scholarship Committee met yesterday to discuss the distribution of this year's scholarships. According to reports from various schools, tuition fees for the next semester will increase by about 200% to 400% compared to the previous semester, and the current donations are less than 22 million yuan, only an increase of 50% to 60% compared to the total amount of scholarships issued in the previous year, which was more than 14 million yuan. Therefore, the distribution of this year's scholarships is very difficult. It is not a good solution to greatly reduce the number of students, and giving each person too little scholarship is also useless. After repeated discussions, it was decided that the scholarship limit for students at all levels this year would be increased by 150% compared to the previous year, that is, 5,000 yuan per person for elementary school, 7,500 yuan per person for junior high school, 10,000 yuan per person for senior high school, and 15,000 yuan per person for university. It is estimated that there is still a shortfall of 10 million yuan in the current donations. However, most schools will start classes within a few days, so it was decided that in addition to elementary school students' scholarships being issued in one lump sum, the rest can only be issued in part first, estimated at 6,000 for junior high school, 7,500 for senior high school, and 10,000 for university. The remainder still needs to be raised continuously, and it is hoped that it can be issued by mid-March. As for existing students, they will continue to be subsidized, except for a few who voluntarily drop out of school and those whose grades are below standard.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers in Western Shanghai Request Increased Power Allocation for Production: Municipal Economic Bureau Appeals</h3>

<h3>Luo Junqiang Concurrently Serves as Chairman of the Baojia Committee</h3>
<p>The chairman of the Municipal Baojia Committee, according to municipal regulations, is concurrently held by the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. The current Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Wu Songgao, has been transferred to head the Ministry of Law, and the position has been taken over by the current Secretary-General, Luo Junqiang.</p>
<p>Baojia Personnel Hold Meeting to Welcome</p>
<p>The Municipal Baojia Committee and the chairmen of its subordinate district sub-committees, deputy chief Lianbaozhangs, and all Baojia personnel, in order to express their support for the newly appointed Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, will hold a grand welcome tea party at the Peacock Hall of the International Hotel at 4:30 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Staff Strictly Prohibited from Extortion</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Xu Jidun, recently told reporters that the vehicle registration offices under the bureau do not charge extra fees beyond the regulations for handling vehicle registration and licensing procedures. If the staff involved are found to be soliciting improper demands, they will be strictly investigated and punished. Mayor Zhou is determined to improve the treatment of municipal government staff, so those who handle affairs are not allowed to use livelihood as an excuse to solicit extra demands. However, on the citizens' side, whether registering or obtaining a license, they must follow the prescribed procedures, which can prevent the staff involved from taking the opportunity to solicit bribes and simplify the handling of procedures. Only with the cooperation of officials and the people, and each upholding the spirit of abiding by the law, can all malpractices be avoided.</p>
<p>In other news: The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has recently made slight adjustments to the organization of the various vehicle registration offices for ease of management, dividing them into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The Grade A vehicle registration offices are: (1) Jiangning Road, (2) Changxing Road, (3) Gongping Road. The Grade B vehicle registration offices are: (1) West Shanghai, (2) South Shanghai, (3) Madang Road. The Grade C vehicle registration offices are: (1) Zhabei, (2) Pudong. The Grade D vehicle registration offices are: (1) Wusong, (2) Baoshan, (3) Minhang, (4) Nanhui, (5) Jiading, (6) Fengxian, (7) Chongming. The bureau will begin processing the exchange of bicycle licenses for the first half of the 34th year in this city starting today (25th). Each vehicle registration office has posted the license numbers and dates for each vehicle exchange, and it is hoped that each vehicle owner will go to exchange them on time to avoid congestion.</p>
<h3>Household Matches to be Sold Starting on the 28th</h3>
<p>The second phase of household matches of the Soap and Candle Allocation Office of the Daily Necessities Control Committee will be allocated starting on the 28th. The scope of this allocation includes the first and second districts. Each person will be allocated one box of Hundred Deer Brand matches. The price per box, including donations, is 20 yuan in national currency. The committee is currently notifying retailers to pay and pick up the goods so that they can be distributed on time. (Also in the news) Regarding the previous allocation of household soap by the committee, because the list was based on the municipal government's list, there were slight discrepancies with the household registers of the Goods Allocation Office, resulting in a small number of residents not yet receiving the household soap in the previous period. The committee is currently consulting with the relevant authorities and will still find ways to provide supplementary supplies to the residents who have not yet received them.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association: Raising Donations for Winter Relief</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that there are many extremely poor people among the citizens of Shanghai, and that assistance is especially necessary during this winter season, this association, after deliberation, decided to raise 50 million yuan to purchase miscellaneous grains for the purpose of selling them at fair prices. Subsequently, the Municipal Government established a Winter Relief Committee, and most of the members of this association participated in the work of the Winter Relief Committee. For example, Mr. Chen Riping, a director of this association, is the Deputy Director of the Winter Relief Committee. It was further decided, in order to save administrative expenses, to entrust the Winter Relief Committee to handle the matter. Furthermore, in order to expedite the process, the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank were first approached for assistance, borrowing 50 million yuan for the Winter Relief Committee to allocate. The Winter Relief Committee has already launched three temporary relief efforts (see yesterday's newspaper reports). However, the loan is stipulated to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, which is fast approaching. The Board of Directors of this association has decided to entrust Xin Shen Bao and Shen Bao newspapers to publicly raise funds. We sincerely hope that wealthy and benevolent individuals in Shanghai will generously donate to help the poor. If you wish to donate, please send your donations directly to the social service departments of Xin Shen Bao and Shen Bao for collection on our behalf. The names of the donors and their titles will be successively published in both Xin Shen Bao and Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Thrift Worth Emulating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we heard that Mr. Wen Lanting's grandson was married, and the wedding was thrifty and simple, with several commendable features: (1) No announcement was made in the newspapers beforehand. (2) Gifts were limited to no more than 400 yuan. (3) The wedding took place at 8:30 a.m. Mr. Wen presided over the wedding ceremony, and at 9:00 a.m. he went to work as usual. (4) No public hall was rented; instead, an extremely simple hall was set up in the family home. (5) The furniture in the bridal chamber was all old. (6) No wedding banquet or refreshments were prepared.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Lanting is a well-known figure in Shanghai and has a wide circle of acquaintances. Although the wedding was not announced in the newspapers, many people still sent gifts. It seemed inhumane to refuse them, so a limit of no more than 400 yuan was imposed. This thorough method of thrift and practical example of leading by example truly embodies wartime living.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we admire Mr. Wen's spirit of practicing what he preaches; on the other hand, we hope that the general public will emulate this spirit, so that a thorough spirit of thrift will be formed in society.</p>
