<h3>馬歇爾卽來華履新　連日與杜魯門貝爾納斯數度晤談　赫爾利已赴京畿山休養</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日專電〕馬歇爾元帥今於白宮兩度與杜魯門總統及只爾納斯晤商，商討赴華使命，惟內容保持秘密。明晨諒將再作晤談，目前跡象顯示，渠將於週末前赴華。</p>
<p>〔又電〕美官方消息，倘交通方面準備完緒，馬歇爾元帥即可於明日塔機飛渝。惟偕行人員迄未獲悉。目下成盼能於下週杪以前抵渝。</p>
<p>〔又電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯在記者招待會終止前謂，今午渠將再度訪晤馬歇爾元帥，俾得詳細討論時局。貝氏並謂：馬元帥之出使中國，將獲得其本人之無條件支持。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日合衆電〕珍珠港事件調查委員會主席巴克萊稱：馬歇爾元帥於赴華前，將被邀作證，然日期未定。</p>
<p>聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國新任駐華特使馬歇爾將軍，賦有廣大機限，正在匆匆東裝，整備迅速　抵中國。其前任赫爾利少將於辭職後，已首途赴京幾山休養。美參議院外交委員會主席康納萊告記者稱：彼擬令赫爾利及國務卿貝爾納斯於星期一日出席參院秘密會議，非正式討論赫氏所稱在駐華大使任內曾受國務院及重慶屬僚反對之說，但無意澈查此事，如共和黨參議員韋勒所要求者。馬歇爾將軍似將於今日即行出發赴重慶履新。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿九日電〕美總統杜魯門選任聲望車著之國際重要人物馬歇爾將軍爲駐華特派大使，此間華人方面印象頗深，以爲馬氏之主要目的，將爲研究中國軍事形勢，特別與國際局勢有關係者。馬氏經過考察後，若贊成美軍留駐中國，以待日軍遣送回國之主張，即可减少茶方面要求美軍　即撤退之煽動。據擁護此主張者言，美軍若急遽撤退，則中國之混亂將十倍於今日，而刮據之局面實質上將愈益廣大。馬歇爾將軍向杜魯門總統提出之報告，必將用作根據，以明白規定一範圍遠大而堅定不移之美國對華政策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社朮慶廿八日電〕馬歇爾任命新聞已使赫爾利辭職新聞爲之减色，在朮慶人目光中，咸承認此間局勢之嚴重，並感覺華北美軍之應留應去，馬歇爾將軍必能當機立斷。重慶外人方面多視馬歇爾之使命，足使有關係各方面明瞭，美國對於中國前途備極關切，且絕不贊成在東九省·內蒙，或新疆有分立政府之任何企圖。此次任命更足以證明中國時局之重要性與嚴重性，一般人同具此　。且人人皆謂美國擬支持保障中國主權與獨立之九國公約，已有充分證明。</p>
<h3>杜魯門選任馬歇爾　主要為軍事問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約二十七日專電〕馬歇爾對華所應執行之確切政策，究竟如何，難尚不得知，但馬歇爾在國際國內確負盛譽，與杜魯門友誼甚深，且極得其信任。就此點而言，馬歇爾實較赫爾利佔有優勢地位。杜當門總統今潘選終身担任軍職之馬歇爾爲特使，足示美國認爲美國對華之當前問題，主要爲一軍事問題。而馬歇爾旣具有軍事政治家之偉大聲望，對於協助解決此項間題，目屬最爲合格。馬氏蒞華以後，對於魏德巡當能予以極大之精神支持與方針之指示，因魏德邁將軍前在陸軍部時，即爲馬歇爾得力下屬之一。馬歇爾之出任駐華特使，將引起美國之普遍贊助。美國新聞週刋稱：國務卿貝爾納斯今日與陸軍部海軍部會談美國對華政策，極爲忙碌。馬歇爾已與蔣主席相識，因在開羅會議時，曾相晤。由馬歇爾最近報告中對於中國局勢之詳盡分析，可見其對於中國之軍事問題，極爲熟悉，故渠之使華，對於將來中國關係之發展，自具有極重大之意義。</p>
<p>又電，馬歇爾於下月將度其六十五歲壽辰，然渠仍如良好之士兵，退休一週後，經杜魯門總統要求，任其駐華特使，隨即應允，毫無難色。據熟悉馬歇爾元帥之人士談稱：馬歇爾元帥顯著之特質之一，乃渠唯有一目標，即爲國是也。聞馬歇爾元帥旣對政治不感興趣，亦不愛慕富貴虛榮，元帥無專斷之惡習，渠唯勤勞工作是尚，對任何混雜事項，極表不喜，渠天性仁慈，然同時具有嚴格請求之軍事效率心理，渠有信心，然亦具幽默，飽　智慧。渠注重紀律，發言聲低且速，記憶力極富，能强記各種事實，常不持稿本，暢述軍事之詳情及數字。馬歇爾元帥任陸軍參謀總長，五年來始終與國會保持極良好關係，並深獲國會之信任及尊敬。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯招待記者稱　美國對華政策不變　兩院要求調查美外交人員</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯，廿八日招待記者，聲明美對華政策不變，並稱，渠本日曾與杜魯門總統及馬歇爾將軍談約一小時，馬歇爾何時啓程赴華，尚未議定。</p>
<p>〔美析聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕參衆兩院各議員本日一致要求，調查美國外交政策及外交人員。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕赫爾利抨擊國務院文在美國歷史上爲空前未有，渠雖未提出人名，但顯係針對國務院遠東司與中國司之人物，傳大使肅淸其駐華大使館內親共份子後，此兩司即繼續阻撓大使自華向美政府提出之報告。</p>
<p>美國國務院宣怖職業外交家名單</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日合衆電〕美國務院宣布，目赫爾利大使抵任後，駐華大使館內職業外交官共十人，貝爾納斯指出爲現任麥帥政治顧間艾其森及其助現謝偉恩，另有三人刻供職於國務院中國司，即林華德（副司長），芮恩及傳瑞門，其他爲刻任美駐蘇大使館一等秘書史密斯，二等秘書戴維斯，現任職國務院之盧登及刻任昆明美領事斯普魯斯，　上海美領事何恩福。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕赫爾利發表辭職宣言後，共和黨領導人參議員惠勒稱，赫爾利所指責之若干外交人員，其行動幾已近乎叛逆，渠當提出動議，要求設立五人特別委員會，縝密審查國務院之活動，行政及服務人員，尤應調查國務院官員「同情共產主義理論」已至如何之程度。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日合衆電〕共和黨衆議員寇蒂斯，要求國務卿將國務院內「所有共產黨及近乎共黨分子盡行撤職」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社達拉斯廿九日電〕中國戰區前空軍司令陳納德少將稱，赫爾利所指某某常任外交官，妨害美國政策者，應交民事法庭審訊。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿九日電〕麥帥政治顧問阿契生，前曾任職重慶美大使館，　以對赫爾利之指責作何感想，據稱，並無意見，惟馬歇爾將軍今次踏入外交界，予亦感覺榮幸。</p>
<p>赫爾利公開發表曾促成中蘇訂約</p>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕赫爾利本日宣稱，美國所公布之政策，即統一中國之一切抗日部隊及擁護中國人對「自由，統一與民主政府」之希望，此項政策獲得英·蘇兩政府之支援，自屬「無疑」。渠又稱，此項政策已為若干美國外交官，以及英·法·荷在亞洲之「帝國主義民政公務員」所反對與破壞。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電電〕赫爾利辭駐華大使後，本日在此間全國報界俱樂部第一次發表公開演說，據稱：中蘇接近而能於今夏簽訂條約，乃渠所促。「蘇聯自始即稱中國共產黨實際上並非共產黨」，蘇聯並未支持中共。據赫氏意見，蘇聯支持中國國民政府以及蔣委員長之領導。並力言蘇聯願與中國成立更密切更敦睦之關係。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕赫爾利頃稱，彼目下並無政治野心，亦未與人討論是否將於一四九八年參加總統競選。</p>
<p>英國會及報界關切中國局勢</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿七日電〕英國會及報界，因赫爾利突然辭職，對中國局勞極爲關切。本日下院開會時，亦有人提出關於中國局勢各項問題，下議員奧斯朋詢外相貝文，英國鑒於中國現局，影響英對華貿易利益之重大，是否已就此事有所聲明，貝文答謂，英政府認此事乃需中國本身解決之內部問題，同時，渠甚望中國問題能獲解決。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕美駐華大使赫爾利辭職事，倫敦各報所持態度頗爲冷靜。</p>
<h3>國軍入錦縣　居民夾道歡呼　叩問主席安好</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿九日電〕據報，國軍直趨瀋陽，現距城垣不足三百華里。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦縣廿八日電〕國軍廿六日進至錦縣，獲飛機百餘架，輜重無算，聞飛機尚有七十餘架完好可用。國軍進入錦縣城時，居民夾道歡呼，傾城瞻仰國軍威議，老年人多涕淚縱橫，首叩問蔣主席安好。錦西錦縣間小凌河之大橋三座，均遭共軍破壞，現正搶修中。錦縣市長已由中央派韓□□代理，於廿六日晨五時入錦縣，布置一切。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿九日電〕據報，國軍因蘇聯尤其和平開入潘陽，現已暫停前進，從事肅淸山海關溝帮子間防區。又聞共軍已退入溝帮子東北七十五里大虎山負嵎。</p>
<h3>社論　經濟政策的解剖</h3>
<p>—已掃除了不少的欵團</p>
<p>戰後的經濟建設，怎樣進行，社會上　着不少的疑團：究竟是自由主義呢？還是計劃經濟呢？如果實行統制，究竟統制到怎樣一個程度呢？對於物價·金融。匯兌這一聯串的問題，還是　取放任態度呢？還是趕忙採取有效的措施呢？復員以後，有許多不合理和不經濟的現象，到底中央的態度作如何觀感呢？</p>
<p>自從第一次最高經濟委員會會議時，主席和宋院長先後發表了吾的經濟方針以後，這些疑團，可說是一掃而空了。</p>
<p>第一，統制問是　主席宣佈：『爲進一步鼓勵大規模的工業生產起見，政府在戰時所加於工業上的種種管制，應該立即撤消，除非在某種情形之下，撤消管制足以影響整偶的國家經濟者，得視爲例外』。宋院長也說：『政府所經營之事業，必須具有充分之國營理由，吾則其結果，非但國庫要增加不必要之負担，對於財政金融的安定，也要受到威脅』。所以最近雖然宣佈設立中國紡織建設公司，共期限只定兩年，翁　院長並說明：此僅爲暫時權宜之計，政府並無與民爭利之意。照此看來，國營事業的範圍，政府限制甚嚴。除非有充分的理由，其他一切事業，還是一以民營為原則。而且政府對於民營事業還願意加以甚大的協助與指導，只要工商企業不以全賴政府爲事，而其本身具有相當的基礎和條件。</p>
<p>第二，外匯問題　主席聲明：『最急要的是確定外匯率來安定金融，必須儘早辦到』。宋院長亦說：『就商務方面說，應當設法使一切關於國際貿易及國際匯兌方面，得到雙方有利的協調』。可見外匯的此率，必將儘早的加以確定，從而將來的國際收支和國際貿易，政府必將予以合理的調整，不至回返到從前那樣散漫的狀態。</p>
<p>第三，經濟重點　偏重在農業呢？還是農工商並重呢？這也是紛紛揣測的問題之一。照主席和宋院長兩位的演辭看起來，完全根據國民黨全民政治的原則，不問農·工·商，一律注重，不惜予以多方的扶助，務使他們平衡發展，以人民一般的獲得工作和較高的生活水準，爲經濟設施終極的理想。</p>
<p>第四，復員問題因爲種種原因，各方面關於接收和復工的情形，的確未能盡如人意，中央對此也很明白，但是主席說過：『這種情形，不能讓他遷延下去，吾們第一件事，必須要使人民重新得到工作』。宋院長且說：『我們必須要抱着大無畏的精神去克服這種困難，使經濟建設的政策，能够澈底實現』。那末，此後改進和整理方面，相信定有澈底的和快速的措施，而對於前所難免的緩慢貪汚的積習，自私自利的敗類，也必定能嚴予懲處，摧陷廓淸，使民衆得到相當的安慰。</p>
<p>以上這幾點，因爲大衆比較最關切的，所以把他特別提一提。順便還要附帶的補充幾句話：（一）政府方針旣不採取嚴格的國營政策，而且爲减輕財政上的重大負担起見，極力避免直接經營，那末，各地各機關迄今爲止所接收的那些事業，如果沒有充分的理由，應該儘早開放，讓民間經營，或在最初扶植民間經營，不必圖謀一定要由政府個別發展，致蒙與民爭利之嫌。（二）外匯問題，與物似，金融，財政，乃至與一般民衆的生活問題，息息相關，希望從速決定，使民生得到安定，工商業順利地展開。（三）經濟問題和政治問題，很不容易劃得淸楚的。如今種種的阻礙，顯然地，大半還是由於治安未復交通未暢的原因。希望朝野上下都能以國家利益爲重，自動地加以克制，加以愛護，使整個的國民經濟，早日獲得昭蘇的機會。而在此人民喁喁望治的時候，更希望政府振奮乾綱，努力整飭，使綏靖淸鄉的工作，加速進行，對於一切危害國本，騷擾民生的暴行，萬不要再有過分的姑息。須知姑息足以義奸，而人民的痛苦即因政府過分姑息不克解除，眞有倒　之感。「出水火而登袵席」，是所望於政府。</p>
<h3>西北歸來３</h3>
<p>— 房滄浪</p>
<p>西蘭公路是橫貫陜甘兩省的西北大動脈，全程七百餘公里，現在每逢星期一·三·五有車對開。因爲西北的汽油很廉，每加侖官價只賣三百元，所以票價也便宜，全程不過四千七百元。班期雖準，可是車子開出以後，那一天能到，可就算不定。</p>
<p>平凉，這地方是龍東的重鎭，北距陜北前哨的慶陽境（原屬甘肅第三行政區，現已爲共軍侵佔）的爲二百里：南去寗夏省境，也不過兩日的路程。這是一個四叉路口，東來的布疋棉紗，西去的皮毛藥材，以及北來西往的黑美人或者是南來東去的芙蓉膏，都要在這個平凉休息一下子。前者在勝利旣來以後，是照常繁榮，後者在甘政刷新聲中，已稍稍斂跡。據平凉郭專員培師告我，隴東治安，已有了進步，不過山中之匪雖除，心中之匪，肅淸還有待。諾如倚賴黑美人找享受的政棍地痞和貪汚，這都是禁政前途的絆脚石，這是西北問題中的小問題，解決這問題的答案，是「完成統一」。</p>
<p>西北各省，各有千秋，我旅行隴東，調查靜寗平凉一帶的物價，是意想不到的低廉。平凉是個大城類價每百斤祇賣三千二百元，猪肉每斤八十元，猪油每斤一百四十元，母鷄每斤七十元。靜寗較平凉還便宜四分之一强。我仔細研究隴東物價所以便宜的結果，不外是下列這幾個因素促成的，一治安無虞，二城鄕交通無阻，三吃便飯不抽稅，四無苛捐雜稅，五管制物價合理而近情，六官吏守法，七商民畏法，八生活儉樸，九飯店旅館不加百分之二十或百分之一百的小賬。　東的物價，便宜有如此，我們同車的旅人心情，感覺到異樣的輕鬆。</p>
<p>扒路軍</p>
<p>我是在十五日這天，到達安的，下車後第一件困難事，是找不到旅館，復員期的西安，顯得更繁榮，更熱閙了。生活程度高過平凉一倍半，香烟較廉，魚最貴，一條三斤重的靑魚，三做賣價最少八千元。據說勝利的爆竹響到西安，給爆竹打倒的有一家銀行，二家錢莊，九家金子店，吃虧最大的是一家專囤大宗棉花的商業銀行。由陝甘各地向華北或東北跑的官商以至難民，都聚攏到西安期待了，於是新聞紙上的商情　，也呈現了異常的熱閙。說到交通，現在隴海的火車，西至寳鷄，東到闋底鎭。</p>
<p>閔底鎭屬於豫西邊緣閔鄉縣，由西安東開的客車，經過渭南華縣，華陰，潼關而止於此。隴海西段破壞最烈的一段，就是　鄉以東的靈寳大橋和山洞。據隴海路局的負責人談，僅僅這一段工程的修復，需時最少要半年。　底鎭與洛陽，由豫陝聯運處，每天對開客車一輛或三輛。　洛之間的公路里程，只有二百三十五，客票的售價，每公里僅以九元計，這是政府特爲便利復員，運送難民還鄉，加强陝豫交通的一個賢明措施。這個聯運處，直屬戰時運輸管理局，處長名呌周延俊，員工均爲靑年，司機則特選技術熟練，性格溫和的中年人，因此，如售賣黑票，私搭黃魚，翻車，撞車，這些弊端及不幸事件，在豫陜聯運處開始通車後，已經少見。</p>
<p>由西安東歸，或者是取道鄭州，轉往平漢南北的旅客，到了鄭州以後，大家不約而同，深深的噓了一口氣，以爲從此可以苦盡甘來坐火車了，那知好事多磨，蕭牆禍作，驀地來了扒路軍。</p>
<p>扒路軍的傑作，是破壞交通，他們在新平道上破壞，平漢路染着了半身不遂的麻　症。由鄭州北開的火車，只能到新鄉，起自新鄉，以迄彰德的這一百零七公里的搶修工程，是需要武裝。因此，修路的員工都掮起了槍，展開了爭路戰。隴海東去的客車，由鄭州先開到中牟，旅客們渡過黃汛區的大河，安抵東岸，然後換車到開封，鄭州開封相距一百四十華里弱，但因車慢河闊，費時也需要一大。由開封東去徐州，現在不通車，原因是當黃口站附近將快修復的前夕，（十一月五日）距離開封七十九里的民權，也發現了扒路軍。可憐那些幾千累萬像潮湧似的難民，由隴海而平漢，聞平漢北路不通，又折回隴海，輾轉流離，吃盡賣光，好不容易挨到了開封，想不到東去之路又被扒壞。難民們識字無多，他們信奉的是現實主義。政府在闋底鎭趕辦豫陜聯遝，將接收日軍所用的較好汽車，廉價給他們乘坐，使他們早日回京，以免凍餒，他們感到溫暖，得到實惠，他們就歌頌政府，感激政府。他們上路以後，到了鄭州，發現扒路軍到處扒路，使他們有路難行，有家難歸，在西北風裏脫下棉衣，甚至脫下小孩的棉衣，取出僅有的一條棉被，跪在車站前面的曠地，以極廉的價値賣出，維持吃大餅喝小米稀飯的般低生活，坐待交通恢復行乞回家，這光景是如何的慘苦。殘酷的現實，敎訓了現實主義的貧苦大衆們，流落在中原的這一百萬難民，他們怎麽想呢？（完）</p>
<h3>魏德邁訪宋院長　商談轉讓華西剩餘器材　否認移交飛七百架說</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿九日電」魏德邁將軍偕美海軍第七艦隊司令巴貝中將，廿七日抵渝，常晚曾謁蔣主席，廿九日晨魏氏訪宋院長，商談轉讓華西區美軍剩餘器材問題。又魏德邁將軍廿九日上午舉行記者招待會，巴貝中將亦參加，茲錄問答如下：</p>
<p>問，馬歡爾元帥使華，對美國在華軍事政策有無變更。</p>
<p>答，馬歇爾元帥來華，係考察目前中國一般情况，以作美國援華及美國在華軍事政策之參考。馬氏資望崇高，國際知識及處理國際問題之經騐淵博，美國國內甚少有人堪與比擬，今番使華，必將　美總統·國會及人民之擁護無疑。</p>
<p>問，將軍此次來渝，是否將爲馬歇爾元帥使華有所準備。</p>
<p>答，否，本人此次來渝，係與蔣主席·宋院長會商華西美軍撤退後，所遣美軍財產處理有關問題。</p>
<p>問，報載美機七百架已移交中國政府，眞相如何？</p>
<p>答，美軍以飛機七百架移交中國政府一節，並無其事，然中國政府正與美方談判購買飛機及其他軍用器材，惟至目前止，尚未獲得結論。</p>
<p>問，將軍與宋院長商討轉讓華西軍用品，外傳中國政府將以其原値百分之三十價資購買之，是否屬實？</p>
<p>答，購買價格尚未決定，美國務院有物資淸理委會之組織，專門協助海陸軍淸理物資之轉讓與處理。本戰區亦有專家處理此事，價格將依成本。運費等因素而決定。</p>
<p>問，外傳美飛行員一部在天津附近爲共黨軍扣留，徐州附近有美兵一部亦被扣留，眞象如何？　答，美飛行員於共產軍控制地區，曾有六人因强迫降落而留滯該區，聞彼等所受待遇尚佳，本人已請蔣主席轉飭共產黨軍釋放彼等歸返，</p>
<p>問前者共產黨軍總司令朱德，曾向美軍提出嚴重抵議，未悉將軍已作覆吾？</p>
<p>答，美國政府僅承認中央政府爲合法政府，英·蘇·法各國亦莫不以中國中央政府爲交涉對象，是項抗議非經由蔣主席提出，故未答復。</p>
<p>問，美軍在渝有聯絡組之機構，在延安亦有聯絡組之機構，是舉是否表示美方承認延安政權？</p>
<p>答，本人來華時，在延安之聯絡組即已存在，本人未將該聯絡組撤回，因美軍不欲獲得共產黨之誤解。另外，因該聯絡組會供給關於日軍之情報，並協助美空軍失事人員。</p>
<h3>傳共軍侵入宛平　另犯擾歸綏包頭</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平二十九日電〕據今晨華方消息，北平附近地區，共黨勢力日益擴大。北平西南二十七里之宛平，已共黨勢有力侵入。聞共軍一萬人備，有輕重機關槍，及白砲等，業已抵達北平西南七十五里之房山。衆信該批共軍係自張家口開來。據稱：朱德所屬共軍，已到達北平西南之良鄉，並在該處徵收糧食，使體力强健男子加入共軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社渝二十九日電〕據第十二戰區駐渝辦事處息：綏遠局勢又趨嚴重，（一）歸綏城郊之共軍，二十五日以三千餘人，附汽車載運之大砲多門由歸綏東南向，城區進攻，被國軍擊退，（二）共軍正抽調冀察部隊約五萬，　鎭集察新兵二萬，向綏包增犯，其中之三千人，已抵歸綏南十五公里之昭君墓。（三）薩縣至包頭沿線各據點，集有共軍萬餘，由賀龍指揮，配有重砲輕重機槍等，日來調動頻繁，有再犯包頭之勢。　包頭西三十公里之　勝城營等地，有共單數千，四出竄擾。</p>
<h3>共黨在美　危言聳聽　陳納德將軍稱</h3>
<p>〔中央社得克薩斯州福斯吳斯城二十七日合衆電〕陳納德將軍在此間發表演說稱：共黨在美國之力量，已將中國內爭之重要性誇大。事實上牽入內爭者，僅有領土及人民百分之十左右，然如諸君在此間閱讀報上之消息，必疑戰火蔓及全國。共黨並在美國散佈種種關於中國內爭之有吾消息，故意小視中國政府，而爲共黨捧塲。</p>

<h3>蘇聯反對託管制　聯合國籌委員已決定設置　軍事參謀會及政治安全會</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十九日電〕聯合國機構籌備委員會今晨集會時，因委託管理制而首次發現意見大相逕庭之徵象。蘇聯代表葛洛米科起述蘇方反對託管制之建議。該建議乃籌備委員會之十四人執行委員會報告盡中提出者，主張設立臨時聯合國團體，以處理託管制問題，澳代表哈斯勒克代表執委會主席伊凡特（缺席刻在華盛頓）提出執委會報告書後，葛浴米科即起立說明下列各點：（一）蘇聯政府不能接受任何託管制臨時組織之建議，其理由僞聯合國憲章，並未規定此組織之設置，故此組織於法不符。（二）蘇聯政府承認全體大會召開時，可設立聯合國主要團體之補助組織，但認爲建議中之託管委員會決非補助組織，而係替代主要之託管議會者。（三）執委會提議之臨時託管委員會將無事可爲，因尙未有土地置於聯合國託管之下也。（四）聯合國憲章規定可受託管之土地，計有三類，即自敵國接收者，聯合國會員國自動交出託管者，及舊國聯之委任統治地，葛洛米科未聞任何土地，自願受託管之建議。至於敵國，非待和的締結，不能受託管。以言委任統治國，則現係聯合國之會員國，故業已符從聯合國所定接受託管之原則，可於全體大會舉行首次會議時，提議將其委任統治土地，置於託管制之下，但同時並無設置特殊組織之必要。（五）蘇聯之意，設置臨時託管委員會，非但不能便利憲章之實施，抑且將阻緩其目的，葛洛米科今日表示之反對，乃在一般人士意料之中，惟處理託管制度之執委會技術委員會，其討論工作已受影響，按執委會此項建議，曾獲大多數票贊成通過，惟捷克蘇聯與南斯拉夫反對，其理由爲按照聯合國憲章，設置臨時託管委員會，於法不符。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕聯合國籌備委員會昨同意設立兩主要委員會，即軍事參謀委員會及政治安全委員會。前者將協助聯合國機構之安全理事會，而後者則爲全體大會之支部。軍事參謀委員會以準備直接行動爲任務，由中英美蘇法五國參謀長組織之。政治安全委員會全體大會之各國，均得派代表參加，以確定維持和平之一般原則爲任務。墨西哥代表贊成另設處理社會及其有關事件之委員會，以促進社會福利，消弭戰爭原因。</p>
<h3>聯合國永會址　或有設在美國之可能</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕記者徧詢聯合國機構籌備委員會五十一國代表，藉悉聯合國機構永久會址，有設在美國之趨勢。代表中八人，自謂將投票贊成設在歐洲，七人未能見面，十二人尙未決定，美國代表重申不願投票之意。東歐及拉丁美洲各國將與蘇聯烏克蘭及白俄羅斯聯合，投票贊成設在美國。西歐各國大的將與英法取共同立塲，贊成設在歐洲。阿拉伯各國尚未決定，加拿大代表亦不願表示意見。欲使此聯台國　　設在美國，需有三分之二票數，即卅四票方可通過。</p>
<h3>三巨頭會議　或不臻再召集　史達林延長假期</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統今日宣稱：聯合國機稱如工作得當，不必再召開三頭會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿九日電〕史達林元帥泱定延長假期，在回京視事前，尙需「長期休息」。目下元帥身體健旺，大抵至新年以前不致返莫斯科。</p>
<h3>美蘇軍隊　自捷克撤退</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華感頓二十八日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯今日宣稱：美軍已自本月二十日起開始由捷克撤退，至下月一日可撤盡，渠又稱，大多數蘇聯軍隊已沿美蘇兩軍接防綫上後撤。</p>
<h3>英蘇意見相左　伊朗局勢嚴重　蘇覆文未能使伊政府滿意　伊叛軍改道向賴許特推進</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十九日電〕據倫敦負責方面稱：伊朗傳來之英國外交公文，證實伊北叛軍已過阿日爾貝珍省邊界消息，惟此間有資格之視察家以爲在目前之情勢中，叛軍似未必即以德黑蘭爲其目標。如伊朗叛變擴成內戰，或對伊朗現政府有嚴重之威脅，則伊朗盟軍將持何政策，現爲倫敦一般人士揣測之問題。就英軍言，英國已申明不干涉伊朗事務，內開或作從事警務性質的行動之決議，但消息靈通方面不信伊當局已計及此種發展，以往二十四小時中，外交地位未有變動，在蘇聯答覆英國駐莫斯科大使寇爾爵士週杪致蘇聯外委長莫洛托夫之函前，大局不致續有發展。倫敦消息靈通方面認爲目前伊朗旣無外方勢力侵入，又有盟軍駐於境內，故伊北事變其重要當不逾地方性質。伊北部落與首都之敵對行動，乃伊則政治中司空見慣之事。惟莫斯科至少已在廣播與報紙中，公然表示同情於叛亂份子之政治要求，而英政府則已對伊朗政府所要求之權利表示同情。兩國雖同有軍隊駐於伊境，而意見相左如此，現局之眞正嚴市氣象厥爲此點。</p>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭二十九日電〕伊朗政府前要求蘇聯政府允許伊軍調動，以阻止南下之叛軍，蘇覆文業已遲到，惟據此間當局言，內容並不令人滿意，其措辭難尙客氣，惟伊朗所要求各點，則均被駁回。官方報告謂叛軍今日已迂迴繞過卡士文，轉向東北之賴許特推進，目標似已不在德黑蘭，此項消息使德黑蘭人心略安，惟危機不過展延，尙不得視爲業已消滅。</p>
<h3>海爾賽　晋昇五星級海軍上將</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕杜魯門總統今日晋昇海爾賽爲五星級海軍上將。凡現役軍人之膺有海軍上將銜者，總統有權許其退職後保留此銜。海氏於休致前將暫在此間供職。</p>

<h3>遠東顧問會決定　對日本政策</h3>
<p>該會定下月杪赴日本</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十九日電〕澳洲外長伊瓦特，於返澳前夕告記者稱：遠東顧問委員會已完成共初步之任務，該會將決定對日政策之大綱，開會三星期半以來，已有很大之進展，初步協定已告成立。惟關於蘇聯與遠東顧問會之關係，以及執行對日基本政策之方法，雖曾一再談判，尚未有最後之議定。有詢伊氏以最高統帥將繼續負責執行對日政策之事者，伊氏謂，旣爲最高統帥，自應有若干自主之權，如將其雙手完全束縛，則將無能爲力矣，又據遠東顧問會發言人稱，該會定十二月二十六日左右赴日，於二月中句返美。</p>
<h3>日衆院昨開會　討論修改憲法</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿九日電〕日衆院今日開會，討論修改憲法，自由黨領袖鳩山提議保存天皇制度，以防止極權，幣原首相附和此議，全塲勉强報以掌聲。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十九日電〕盟軍當局今日命令日本貴族院必須允准報界出席一切會議。民事情報與教育組主任狄克稱，貴族院除全體大會外一律不准報界出席之規定，完全不能令人滿意，而與盟軍培發言論自由與其牠民主原則之意志相背。渠謂麥帥之意志，爲「將會議室之門開放」。</p>
<h3>寺內壽一病危　獻刀典禮將作罷</h3>
<p>〔路透社西貢廿九日電〕前日本東南亞總司令寺內大將，患瘋癱症甚劇，已入彌留狀態，故常東南亞盟軍統帥蒙特巴頓明日來此巡察時，恐已不能由寺內將軍刀獻呈，故獻刀典禮恐不得不臨時作罷。</p>

<p>荷蘭當局申明立塲</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕據悉，勞傑曼博士最近曾接見英報記者發表談話，主張荷蘭軍隊應即登陸爪哇，協助枚平叛亂。勞氏謂荷蘭並不擬壓制民族運動，且願與其合作。惟先決條件，則爲恢復當地秩序，沒收暴徒武器，然後始可談判。印度尼西亞新內閣總理沙利猶不失爲有聲望之人，其閣員亦多幹練之士，不若索卡諾之曾與日方勾結，吾人願以印度尼西亞民族運動之領袖視沙利而與其談判，但不擬視之爲印度尼西亞共和國之總理。沙利就職之初，亦曾聲明願意談判之意，後爲極端派所挾持而未果。今則竟要求完全獨立，脫離荷蘭王國，是使談判瀕於不可能矣。吾人準備使印度尼西亞人參加內閣及議會，對外亦願其成爲荷蘭王國之一份子。惟完全獨立自治，目前猶談不到。</p>

<h3>美參議員詹森指責政府　勿向對蘇作戰之途前進</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕參議員詹森昨於參院辯論時稱：美國現正以肯定而迅速之方式，向對蘇作戰之途前進。吾人對日作戰，係因疑惑，誇大與綏請三者所造成。今日如再施行此種手段，則不免目悮矣。俄人深知吾人僅以無彈之手鎗相恐喝，其對於我國之瞭解，當與時但增云。</p>

<h3>滇省參議會呈部主張　分配國大所在地點　旁規定交換敎授辦法</h3>
<p>〔大華社軍慶航訊〕我國幅員遼　，以往因交通困難關係，以致各區文化程度，顯有參差，滇省參議會有鍳於此，因特提請敎育部，妥愼分配，國立大學所在地點及訂定交換敎員辦法，略謂：吾國國立大學，多設於京滬平津武漢，迨抗戰軍興，相繼遷於桂蜀滇黔。刻因戰事結束，敎育復員，內遷各校，均紛紛遷回故址。竊以爲於此時期，亟宜統籌全局，妥爲分配，果屬環境需要，已遷者不妨仍留新址，即需遷去者，亦不必盡返原地，總以因地制宜，使各地大學教育得平均發展，庶不致交通便利之處，則學校叢集，人滿爲患，邊遠之區須千里負笈，求學維艱。現幸空運發達，縮地有方，千里之程，朝發夕至，向之交通梗阻問題，事實上已不存在。是以國立各大學之分配區域，應請妥愼選擇，趁遷校以前爲適當處置，俾赴事機，而應需要。此外並請規定各大學每年彼此交換敎授辦法，切責施行，則調盈劑虛，全國學子均得同受優良之敎育，而內地邊　，尤得爲均齊之發展，其予輸入思想，研究學術，當收絕大之效果。惟於輪値服務邊遠區域之敎員，似應另訂優待條例，用償其跋涉之辛勤，而獎其服務異地之興趣云云。頃聞敎育部對此提案，正審愼考慮中。</p>
<h3>清華校長梅貽琦　視察華園</h3>

<h3>晨友盃籃球　緊要之幕　梁溪戰汕隊　東華可穩勝飛馬</h3>
<p>晨友盃今日五時半起照例二幕，內梁溪與汕隊之役，尤爲緊要之一幕，按梁溪已二戰二勝，汕隊亦未逢勁旅，保持不欺，者番相逢，勢必各門其智，各盡其力，爭一日之短長，今日秩序如左：</p>
<p>東華—飛馬（甲組）五時卅分</p>
<p>梁溪—汕隊（甲組）五時卅分</p>
<p>東華逢飛馬，自可望取得勝利，蓋飛馬不論球藝與經騐，均見相差一級，况東華隊員如賈幼良，韓龍海等，皆爲足籃球雙樓好手，且該隊極能得人和之利，球迷輙樂僞義務啦啦，聲勢方面，獲得便宜，今遇庸弱之飛馬，在勝利之外，冀有滿意之成績。</p>
<p>梁溪隊確具上佳之選手，惜以成隊未久，不免有彼此不能合作之憾，其所演出者，祇靠一些經騐。反之，汕隊則正以組織有年，端賴純熟之隊的功夫以勝人，益以後起新人，何立德之日新月異，較之一般老將，亦不多讓，今朝兩强相逢，勝負有關前途，覓取勝局，皆非易易。竊以爲梁溪須全隊人員，個個在登樂造極之狀態中，庶幾有望·汕隊則切忌慌亂，鎭靜應用，穩紥穩打，以已之長，攻人之短·梁溪老將勢必低頭，且看今戰雙方如何。</p>
<h3>臺灣文化協進會的創立（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 游彌堅</p>
<p>（六）我們感覺到我們的工作的重要性，須要積極進行，所以日內就要出版一種刋物，名呌「現代週刋」，幷舉行通俗演講會，也要開始傳習國語國文，以及其他社會服務的工作。</p>
<p>陳長官說：「臺灣是三民主義的苗圃」。爲要究成這理想的苗圃，我們要將帝國主義日本所種的毒草雜草先行除掉，土地亦要重新耕過，一方面再拿祖國以及世界的好肥料自自由民主的文化—來澆上。有了這工作，我們的好種—臺灣人，才能儘量地生長，才能成爲三民主義的良苗，移植到犬陸，移植到世界各地，這才是我們無上的光榮，無上的幸福！</p>
<p>我們臺灣人，本來是漢民族最好的種子，在數千年的長期歷史過程中，我們因爲不屈服於異民族的壓迫，所以由中原移到福建，由福建移到臺灣。在臺灣，先被滿淸的壓迫，後被日本帝國主義的虐待榨取，但是我們仍舊保持着堅强的民族意識，沒有被日本同化過去，沒有喪失民族的精神。這就可以證明我們是好種。旣然知道是好種，我們更要做好，所以我們要提高我們的自導心。我們旣然能够回到青天白日之下，我們就有盡量伸長的機會，我們可能做人家的榜樣，可能建立理想的臺灣，並且堅信一定可以做得到。但是我們須要將這苗圃裏面的毒草雜草剷除，澆上好肥料，才能得到正常的全面的發展。這種除草耕地澆肥的工作，就是我們文化協進會同仁工作的目標，希望大家協力，向着這目標前進，協助政府的建設，來完成理想的新臺灣！</p>

<h3>美金融及工商界　願在華大量投資　協助中國建立大規模工業</h3>
<p>美遠東貿易委會主委樊克林談話</p>
<p>〔本報專訪〕前工部局總董樊克林，此次應美國國外貿易協會之聘，出任遠東貿易委員會主任委員，於句日前搭機來滬考察中天貿易情形。本報記者昨特往訪，據　氏語記者：中美商人皆希望兩國間之貿易；能在短時期內暢通。</p>
<p>亟應締結友好商約</p>
<p>目前有很多問題，皆不能解決，使兩國商人徒然有計劃有財力，而不能着手復興兩國間之經常貿易。恢復貿易第一關健，是在締結中美友好商務條約。美方已在一年前將草的擬就，送交中國政府徵求意見。然目下關於該條約之商談，尚未臻具體化</p>
<p>希望獲得合理保障</p>
<p>其次，關於外匯兌率，外匯凍結等主要問題均未解決，目前美政府及工商界，皆極注意中國新公司法之措施，美方希望該法令能予外商資金以切實和合理的保障。樊氏來華前，曾與美當局及工商界，商討美對華貿易及投資問題。據燓氏云，美金融界及工商界領袖，皆願在華作大量之投資，以協助中國建立大規模之工業。</p>
<p>美資本家考慮兩點</p>
<p>余旅華二十餘年，中　是我第二故鄕，因此我不得不損　說：戰後渴望獲得美國資金的國家很多，美資本家在選擇投資的對象時，必先考慮到資金是否能得保障，營業的推進是否能得到便利。中國方面如欲吸收大量美資金，鼓勵美商投資，則應切實注意到此兩點。</p>

<p>本市外商銀行如匯豐·麥加利·花旗·大通·有利·華比等，已向財政部補辦登記手續，請領執照，取得法人資格，以便參加銀行同業公會。並須待外匯匯率確定後，方能開始營業。又在陪都設立之銀行，如須在滬設分行，必須營業在四年以上，而經財部核准者爲限。</p>

<h3>氣象預測</h3>
<p>黃海上空，天陰暗，中度風。上海地區，有霧，間有微雨，東風。東海上空，有雲霧，中度東北風或東南風，昨日溫度最低五五·八度·最高五八·五度。</p>
<h3>酒·吧·間　都市淘金的新興事業</h3>
<p>商人的頭腦，也許是最靈敏的。他們看到一批又一批的盟軍從天空或海上不斷地來到上海，看透了他們因戰爭而感到的枯燥生活，於是就在調劑二字上着想，他們用盡各種方法，一方面當　爲的是利，來博取盟軍的安慰。最近本市就產生了許多新興事業，其中尤以酒吧間爲最，已超　了七百家以上。但商人往往只顧了利而忽略了應有的道德，所以現在有一百四十八家，已被勒令停業，這是他們非常痛心的吧。　每當華燈初上，朱葆山路·中正東路·一帶，酒吧問比較最活躍，而且也最多。他們唯一的招攬主顧　　，就是美軍當局給他們的「准許美軍入內」的招牌。其次是音樂和伴舞的幾十位「英語通」舞女—「吧鈞兒」。至於出售的飲料，以啤酒爲大宗，一家安樂宮，每天竟可銷去二十箱左右。</p>
<p>霞飛路，亞爾培路·一帶，和東百老匯路以及提籃橋，也有許多酒吧。不過生意較中正東路差一點，主持人以　太籍較多，但出售的泗類却相當講究。至於售價已不像最初可以擅自作主，這是爲了「不准美軍入內」的警告效力。現在啤酒的售價在四百元至七百百元間，白蘭地和威士忌每杯七百元至一千二百元。</p>
<p>在酒吧問內，可以看到形形色色的花樣。兵士好酒，甚至不醉是不肯放杯的。因此在每晚十一點半，就有許多美國憲兵到酒吧問去巡視，把酒醉的送回去。要不然他們竟會睡下去，一直到酒醒。</p>
<p>靠酒吧間寄生的，還有着一大批人；他或她們以出售紙花或共他小玩意博取微利，當然三輪車夫也在內。</p>
<p>最近當局感到這種酒吧的畸形發展，已予以限制，並且將留存的加以審查。這無非是要使經營酒吧的，要好好地以正當手段來換取利潤。（躉）</p>
<p>中央規定目明年一月一日零時起，公路交通一律改爲靠右行駛，各界對改靠右行原因及辦法，尚未明瞭，茲向市公用局探誌如下：</p>
<h3>明年元旦起　公路交通靠右行　市瞈用局發表原因</h3>
<p>（甲）改駛原因，（一）我國最近進口汽車，多由美國輸人，共方向盤及燈光之安置，原均依照美國交通規則靠右行駛設計，以吾國現行交通規則，係靠左行駛，致其方向盤及燈光非先改裝不可，此項改裝費，約需增加原價五分之一，即每改裝五輛，須付六輛代價，故爲節省改裝費起見，亟應靠右行。（二）世界各國汽車行駛方向，雖有靠左靠右之分，但靠右行駛之汽車，依據一九三六年統計，約佔所有汽小總數百分之九十以上，爲適應國際間公路父通行車方向趨勢起見，亟應改靠右行。（三）目前我國汽車因數年來無新車進口，已逐漸殘破减少，中印路雖通，尚無大量新車運入，正是行車改向之絕好機會，因車輛少改變較易，同時因改向而發生的事故與危險，亦可减少。</p>
<p>（乙）規定辦法：（一）人力車輛，如手車，脚踏車，人力車，小板車，大板車等，獸力車輛如大車，馬車等，以及轎馬等，均應自汽車行駛改向日起，一律改靠右行駛。（二）部隊行車車及羣衆遊行，應靠右行走與車輛一致。（三）成隊行引，摻雜車馬者，應與車馬同樣靠右行走，惟須於事先通知當地警察局或該管公路機關。（四）非整隊行人，在人行道上行走，界右靠左，不予規定。</p>

<h3>債市扶搖直上　丙種叩六百大關</h3>
<p>冷熱門相差三分之一</p>
<p>公債多方繼續操縱，堅持不放，金股散戶源源加入，求過於供，大戶從中時來拉提，借貨拋空份子不得不忍痛力補，市價扶搖直上，戊丙暴跳於先，雜牌跟隨於後，結果再漲一百二至一百五不等，收後丙種竟喊高至六百六大關，因而甲乙種亦有四百元以上之價，投機氣氛濃厚，各種間差價竟拔開至二百元光景，冷熱門相差三分之一，亦屬奇跡。</p>
<p>華股以證劵業同業整理委員會在各走廊遍貼勸告停止賣買之通告，市况冷落，惟公債方面獲利出飽者，不乏前來拉提，因而低後多盤，結果較前收微挫。</p>
<p>外股市况依然平郁，隨金價上落，怡和紗廠目一四五〇元左右盤好至一五〇〇元內外，結果則較前收無甚榮辱，交易極少。</p>
<h3>烚赤美鈔盤小</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因渝市報小，繼續盤低，惟過程極爲穩定，晨開後賣方活動，自七七萬五一路盤小至七五萬六，此後銀行界略來趁低吸納，得以支持，午刻散空被迫了結，一度見七七萬七，最後仍徘徊於七七萬內外，結果較前收微挫二萬零，銀樓節金掛小至每兩兌出八尤三，紋銀仍掛六百五，銀元形勢穩健，喊價略升為四百六，暗拆以去路又淡，跌至一角三分左右。</p>
<p>美鈔仍隨金價下游，紗花帮頗有納胃，局勢尚平，全日盤旋於一三一〇元內外，結果較前收續降二十元，港票平定，結果老貨小五元，新貨則平。</p>
<p>米價堅挺</p>
<p>昨日米市供求兩敵，市形堅挺，價升二三百元，麵粉到銷兩旺，市勢牢立，油價以靑島來源續旺，依然下游，再小千餘元，豆餅青呆轉軟，見小千元，黃豆以油餅俱降，隨之不振，價落三四百元。</p>
<p>紗銷轉疲</p>
<p>棉紗客銷减色，人心亦萎，二〇支紗回小二萬元，一六支亦跌一萬元之譜，細紗因存底極稀，價尚堅定，昨華鳳輪進口，由寗波裝來餘姚棉化一百二十五包，茶葉十五箱。</p>
<p>煤市呆平</p>
<p>白煤層頻有吐售，續趨下游，白煤塊及烟煤塊，以市上存底不多，持有者不願賤脫，呈呆平之局，烟煤　船舶工廠略有問津，價與前市相仿，木柴承前跌勢續挫，木炭市價較爲平穩。</p>
<p>染洋疲落</p>
<p>染料因川帮已辦之貨，待裝未發，蓋貨船噸位有限，不敷運用，且各埠所存染料紛紛裝返本市，（抗戰前爲求資產安全，運染料至杭州溫州南京各口岸者爲數至夥），因是川帮及各方均採觀望之心，故價一致下游，前途漸趨平疲之勢。</p>

<p>由此　論，對於一部份人所指摘之不合法的增資愚亦願以一得之見，提供參攷，夫增資之爲公司者，須為變更之登記，爲合夥爲獨資者，亦須換領證件，是矣，但此爲對於第三者所取得法律上立塲之問題，非所語於股東及合夥人之內部相互間也，蓋增加資本，在公司須經過股東會之決議，在合夥亦須經過合夥人會議之決議，然後塡寫塡股書，或重寫合夥議據，股東與合夥人，均已受此內部契的之拘束矣，徒以主管官署內遷，登記之變更，延未舉辦，以致不能以之對抗第三者耳，際此河山光復，我們的政府重來，正可依據事實，向主管官署補辦手續，何得以增資之以僞幣收人者及未經登記者爲不合法，而抹殺之乎，且年來除少數企圖虛抬股票市價，濫行升股性質的增資外，有不少的工廠行號，實以面淚向股東請求增資，收得所謂僞劵的現金，以免破產，以維開支，以勉力運用而開工而開門者。此種工廠行號，今已有多家終於以後力不繼，淘汰消滅，其幸存者，正擬重整餘燼，以謀補救，吾人對之，當與以同情也，此外如新設之金業，縱其資本全係以僞劵繳納，『無罪』之情形，正與此同，今令其補爲設立之登記可也，作爲不曾設立而從新設立亦可也，更何得以其當初之資本係偽券而從而一概『僞』之乎，論者又日，淪陷期內之增資，往往粗製濫造，使</p>
<p>老股東吃虧</p>
<p>其意當指股東內去不及參加增資而言，愚亦有同感，依法增加資本，應先儘原有股東照原出資額平均分認，有餘再招新股，論情企業之有相當底子，亦應先敬舊人，當通貨購買力日落之抗戰時期，在決議增資之時，如將其資產以時値論之，蓋往往超過帳面金額，則老股東之以不可抗或非可歸責於原自己之因，而不及參加增資者，自屬太吃虧，嚴格論之，董事會應負其責任也，但此責任是另一問題，言之非數千言不能盡，異日當另文論之，要之，不能因此而主張將已收之增資額籍偽劵不値錢之名，而多打折頭耳，因此愚以爲帳面資本金額之整理，應完全着重於事實是否已有此或可有此法幣額之資本，如曰有之，則應儘速將現在帳面額，平掉爲法幣，若　不足，亦可核減，務使其規律手續及時間等等，趨於簡單化，俾工商各業，得以資本金額之已經確定，開始整理其他千頭萬緒之事項，至於其他問題，</p>
<p>不容混同解決</p>
<p>例如增加手續之是否合法也，老股東損害之應如何賠償也，底子甚好各家稅款之應如何報解也，勞工之應如何優待也，胥爲各別的問題，在整理帳面資本金額問題之本身，何必因此多所牽迎，多所延宕，而此許多問題，更何能聽其掩在整理帳面資本金額問題之下，而偸渡陳倉，一部份人往往不談則已，認爲原本不値得討論，而問其方法，則無有也。談則多方顧慮，却以爲必須整個談得澈底，則愚敢冒昧言曰，帳面資本金額，永無完全合於法律合於理想而又便於實際處理之整理方法矣，不過於此有一節須鄭重提明者，在上述整理辦法之下，應請政府</p>
<p>酌量免稅</p>
<p>以免企業家更多顧慮，蓋所得稅利得稅及勞工分紅問題，將因此而引起糾紛，除勞工應由各家按照實情，雙方兼顧，以各別處理外，其稅收問題，如資本金額移補數之出於固定資產升値者，應免除其稅，出於未分配盈餘者，可依簡化程序，由各業同業公會以公允之估計，彙報若千，則河山重光，與民更始，今而後，旣有合法政府在上，工商各業當可遇專禀承，得所準繩矣。（完）</p>

<h3>大喜的訊息</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>在十一月二十八日張道藩先生和中宣部副部長許孝炎先生招待奉市文化界的茶會中，許先生向在座的人發表了一個大喜的訊息。他說政府已經有一個重要的決定，要修改現行的出版法，實行新聞自由與出版自由。他並且說，新出版法業已草擬完成，現在正由立法院加以審核。通過後即可實行。</p>
<p>許先生還說，今後的新聞紙雜誌和出版物的登記，祇是一種手續問題，而不再是限制問題。這在中國的文化界，實在是一件值得興奮的事，也是一件值得欣幸的事。新出版法的公佈與實行，將使中國的政治和社會，朝民主開明的路上跨一大步。</p>
<p>在美國，在英國，甚至在法國，戰事一結束，不到幾天，所有的新聞檢查就完全廢止，恢復常態了。因為在一個真正的民主國家中，報紙和出版物是民眾輿論的總匯，而民意是政府處理國政的準繩。政府為表示遵重民意起見，必須在萬不得已的時候才在萬不得已的地方給予民眾以萬不得已的限制。現在我們的政府決定廢止檢查，實行新聞與出版的自由，雖然有人會以為是遲了一點，但是遲了總比沒有好的。</p>
<p>我們歡迎這個喜訊的宣佈，我們更歡迎這個喜訊的早日實現！</p>
<h3>集中營內的外僑</h3>
<p>— 馮達</p>
<p>前幾天碰到一位剛從某集中營出來的外國朋友，闊別六年，不禁感喟交集，他說他住集中營三年，嚐遍了前所未嚐的人生苦味，也看透了許多人生的光明與黑暗面。大有進集中營三年，勝讀十年書的意思。</p>
<p>他說初進集中營的時候，每天吃兩頓飯，每頓祇有一小碗冷飯加一點蔬菜，後來糧食不够分配，竟每天祇吃一頓。因為外僑對於這種食物吃一頓。因為外僑對於這種食物吃不慣，而且數量又少，因此每個人都感覺營養不足。我的這位朋友體重從一百五六十磅減輕到一百十幾磅，有一個時期頭髪全部脫光了。營中有很多人都發生了同樣的現象。等到一出集中營。大家因為餓了幾年，都想大吃一頓。結果吃了下去，都因為腸胃不能吸收而腹痛，大痛一場。</p>
<p>營中有許多洋行的大老闆和銀行經理，平常家裏都是僕從滿屋的。進了集中營以後，事情都得自己做，覺得非常不慣。有幾位嬌生養慣的經理先生和夫人，懶惰成性，起初都不肯做事情。可是結果因為不做事就沒飯吃，也祇好高抬貴手去做了。</p>
<p>我問這位朋友他們是怎麽曉得勝利的消息的，他說他們有一種特別的通消息的『密電碼』有幾位在營中生病的外僑，日方特許他們出營到醫院裏去診治，他們有一輛紅色的機器脚踏車，每天開過集中營。大家約定如有好消息時，就在車燈外包一塊白手巾做暗號。八月十一日早上，營中的外僑看見這輛紅機器脚踏車開過，車燈外包着白手由，知道是有好消息來了，於是歡聲雷動。可是接下幾天，那輛車子開過的時候，車燈外並無白布，大家又都消沉了下去，直到八月中旬，日本正式投降的消息宣佈，這輛車子開過時，車燈上又包白布，於是大家才曉得勝利真正來臨了。</p>
<p>日本人為防盟機投彈起見，特地在外僑集中營附近建造了兩間工廠，廠中有幾位工人，時常投擲紙條向外僑報告消息。勝利後工廠停工，這些報告消息的工人，都由營中的外僑介紹工作，未致失業。</p>
<p>這位朋友說，有一輛大卡車經常運載糧食和燃料到集中營去，車上有一個工人，會說很有限的幾個英文字，大家都不曉得他是誰，勝利以後，這位工人忽然穿了筆挺的軍服出現了，滿口流利的英語，原來他是中央派來的地下工作者，專門調查美中營中外僑的生活情形，向中央報告的。</p>
<p>在集中營中時，有一次，一位管理集中營日本人無故打了一位外僑一個耳光，營中外僑氣憤填膺，全體出動示威，並表示如不向外僑道歉，大家決定與日軍死拼，雖犧牲性命亦在所不惜。日軍看見眾怒難犯，終於呌那位日本人向外僑道歉了事，並保證以後不會再有同樣的事件發生。</p>
<p>營中有四位日本人，對外僑特別兇蠻，大家恨之入骨，公開聲言勝利之後，必欲得之而甘心。後來勝利來臨，這四個日本人自知難於倖免，遂悄然失踪，不知去向。另外有一位為虎作倀的中國人，亦於勝利日捲舖蓋　颺了。</p>
<h3>民間的裁判</h3>
<p>— 方剛</p>
<p>在巨潑來斯路潘逆三省的黑色大鐵門上，除了貼着第三方面軍的封條之外，還有用粉筆寫的幾句話。其一說：『十分英雄都用盡，後代于孫　做人！』另外一句說：『做得好來殺得好，如此英雄如此　！』</p>
<p>潘逆三省在敵偽的卵翼下，也算做過叱咤一時的『英雄』。然而『英雄英雄』，『而今安在』？</p>
<p>潘逆三省在敵偽的卵翼下，也算做過叱咤一時的『英雄』。然而『英雄英雄』，『而今安在』？</p>
<p>潘逆大鐵門外的粉筆字，是民間　他的裁判。</p>
<h3>憂慮以外</h3>
<p>— 賀元深</p>
<p>剛剛迎接完勝利，許多青年人便又為憂　所苦　，他們不相信戰爭，不相信政治，不相信一切；他們不能滿意　現實，許多許多事他們都不能滿意，於是他們憂慮，憂慮，終朝的憂慮，而實際，他們自己也明白，這憂慮並無補於事實。</p>
<p>八年艱苦的抗戰，國家獲得一個成長的機會，這機會誰都看到，青年人有一條一致的心思，想一把把　機會抓住，立刻讓夢想變為事實。這是一種年青人善良的心思，他們太愛他們的祖國。</p>
<p>然而抓住這機會，他們還沒有力量，却又恨別人沒有抓牢，再不然抓住了而未能迅速的使夢想變為事實，於是不免失望，煩　，憂慮。</p>
<p>生長在這國度中，我們正不必苛責年青人，他們願意祖國成長，他們並沒有錯。但我們也不能不感到痛苦，看着這些年青人為憂慮煎熬着，沒有心思做事，也沒有心思讀書。</p>
<p>到菓木園去，沒有成熟的菓子我們不肯採橘，到森林裏，沒有成材的樹木我們不肯砍伐，不堪利用的流水必須疏濬，貧瘠的泥土必須施肥。對於年青人，我不願空洞的來高唱『讀書救國』，因為這口號曾一度為年青人所厭棄，在祖國危亡的時候，為了搶救那即將淪陷的土地。那即將做奴隸的命運，做一些事實在是大工作。</p>
<p>如今，我們，年青的朋友們，已經完成了這工作，祖國的困擾已變成如果去抓住這成長的機會。為了使這機會更為穩固，我們不能不更求一個穩固的基礎，酸果子應該留在樹上等候成熟，未成材的小樹應使其繁長，物應便其得主，學須便其有用。</p>
<p>所以，在目前一個更艱苦的工作加在年青朋友們的身上了。我們沒有法子使一個青蘋果立刻變紅，沒有法子使一株小樹變得粗大，但他們如不夭折，必將是支持基石的器材。對於目前的憂慮，我們如果以為以前沒有做够準備的工作，現在還該做起來，對於年青人，在目前，該沒有比讀書更重要的了。因為現在的祖國在召喚着有實學技能的人材，為了國家，我們該理智一點。</p>
<h3>小春秋</h3>
<p>勝利和平後，我們指出了許多偽君子，但我們也看到了不少真小人。</p>
<p>— 阿冬</p>
<p>有了原子，於是遂結成了鬼胎。</p>
<p>— 經香</p>
<p>大家都稱重慶為『山城』，那末上海該是『澤國』了。無怪山城的漁翁紛移玉趾，高喊到『上海的釣魚去！』的口號，因為上海遍『海』都是大魚小魚。</p>
<p>— 罕言</p>
<p>『米賤傷農，』所以有人說：糧價太賤也不好。</p>
<p>— 無名氏</p>
<p>賣的人憂慮跌價，買的人憂慮漲價。『立場不同，持論各異。』</p>
<p>— 靈芝</p>
<p>沒有職業急求職業，有了職業又嫌不能維持生活。此之謂『落水要命，上岸要田。』</p>

<p>原子彈是結束二次大戰的功臣。原子彈是否將成為引起三次大戰的禍首，這要我看們的政治家怎樣處理原彈子問題。</p>

<h3>盤縣三日</h3>
<p>— 宋牧</p>
<p>車子左轉右拐，在山嶺裏翻上翻下，到後來終於在一片曠地上停下來。這裏離縣城還有里把路，但車子拋了錨，怎麽搖也賴着不肯走了。車頭吐着氣，彌漫着一天白烟。</p>
<p>看樣子我們祇有徒步起行了。本就够疲倦的·這麽一來，更是滿臉風塵僕僕了。天已經是摸黑時分，到達縣城裏，有陣陣炊烟從低矮的屋簷上冒出來，野狗隨着這批外鄕客　　地吠着。</p>
<p>有一個壯年的么司將我們接到一所棧房裏，屋頂很矮，一間正房裏橫擱着好幾張床舖，黑暗裏亮着一兩星火光，有人躺着在吹烟。</p>
<p>不久那個瘦長的司機也來了。他說他盡了最大的力，車子修不好。惟一的盼望最好明天有路局車子經過，否則我們祇能在這裏待下來了。</p>
<p>又過了一會，么司將油燈掌起來。這屋子四壁是用草蓆編成的，以是靜下來時，可以清晰聽見外面的風吼，燈光微弱暗淡，而且不時搖搖幌幌。躺在床上旅客的影子劃到牆壁上，也就上下地跳盪不已。</p>
<p>這家店主人有個女孩子，約摸十四五歲年紀，梳着兩條油光辮子，時常在房間裏走來走去。端臉水，斟茶，她走過那裏人們的視綫也就集中到那裏。但她却時常低着頭，默默地，眼睛裏藏着抑鬰。</p>
<p>飯後旅客的精神變得煥發起來，有說有笑的。吹烟的朋友也一骨碌從床舖上坐了起來，喝着濃釅釅的茶。那個小姑娘又走過來了。於是好事的將她的一雙小手拉過來，逗趣地：</p>
<p>「喂，小姑娘，十幾了？有婆家嗎？」</p>
<p>旁邊有個茶葉商，於是接上去，指着我：</p>
<p>「可不然說給這個小伙子吧！瞧，多好的一對！」</p>
<p>那個小姑娘的臉龐已漾起了一片粉紅，死命地掙扎着，一鬆手，於是連忙　了。</p>
<p>在她身後騰起一片歡笑聲，也有的將手心拍得通紅。</p>
<p>地個茶葉商還不忘記像我歪歪眼。</p>
<p>「喂，小伙子，怎麽樣？不錯吧，一張鵝蛋臉，你沒仔細瞧牠那雙眸子，羞滴滴地。」</p>
<p>過後，他們將話題轉到別處去，大膽地談論着他們的經歷。</p>
<p>於是噶噶噶淫邪地笑着。在這種場合裏，再沒有像對女人的經騐那類談話，再呌他們發生興味了。</p>
<p>我記不清什麽時候沉甸甸地落到夢鄕裏。人們的談話慢慢變得稀少起來，夜似乎很深了。</p>
<p>第二天，我們沒有能動身，路局派來的車子一直沒有信。</p>
<p>在這黔南的小城裏，待得够膩味地，一片荒原，一片蕪寂。</p>
<p>那是够有趣的事，我的脚步轉到城角的城隍廟裏。大門口我忽然發現那個女孩子，同着小伴侶們拐一籃鮮花。我想湊過去同她說點什麽，但她一看見是我，連忙紅着臉跑開了。</p>
<p>以後，我在客棧裏又碰見過她幾回，但總是有意無意地躲開。到後來，她甚至像無意地躲開。到後來，她甚至像為客人斟開水一類的活也不幹了。偷偷地藏到角落裏。旅客發現了這奇跡，於是有的要同我算賬，說都是為着我，連小姑娘都不敢打照面了。也有的私語着：「真好玩，小姑娘害羞起來了。」</p>
<p>我照例以微笑代替答語。</p>
<p>我們在這寂寥的小城裏又住上兩天，第四天正午一輛車子開來，我們歡欣着一窩蜂湧上去。</p>
<p>從車窗裏，我看見那個小女孩子也立在人叢中，睜大着眼睛望着，我們的視綫碰着了，這次意外地她沒有避開。</p>
<p>車子搖盪了幾下，於是急馳地開走了。身後遺留的是一大堆黃烟，另外有一雙憂鬰的眸子，慢慢在我腦筋裏擴大起來。</p>
<h3>落葉</h3>
<p>— 田野</p>
<p>秋天的早晨，我散步在寂寞的花園裏。</p>
<p>偶然，輕輕地，悄悄地，飄下了兩三片落葉。</p>
<p>我俯身拾起那枯黃的葉子，撫弄着它；但立刻我又丟棄了它，並且踐踏它。</p>
<p>『去吧！衰老的枯葉！』我向躺在地上的落葉說：『讓西風將你吹到池塘裏去吧！讓秋雨來浸蝕你的無用的體軀吧！這世界再不需要你了！』</p>
<p>我並不同情它的不幸的遭遇，也不嘆息它的命運，因為這是應該的！當葉子老了，枯了，對於人們，對於世界，還有什麼用處？</p>
<p>一切無用的，衰朽的，都該毀滅！讓新生的起來代替！</p>
<p>因此，我也痛恨那些已枯萎而還未落下來的葉子，因為它們阻碍了新生代的成長。但我知道，在西風再吹起的時候，在許多次的風雨以後，這世界上將不再有它們的存在；我也知道，在寒冷將盡的日子裏，新生的一代將吐出青青的萌芽，而且，它們將統治着整個的大地，當春天來到的時候！</p>
<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>一　猴子和鸚哥</p>
<p>黃金似的架上，鸚鵡在習話。</p>
<p>猴子被牠吵得心煩，生氣了：『成日價咭咭呱呱，賣弄你會講人話，也不去照照鏡子，可有半點兒人模樣？』</p>
<p>『哼！算你有三分像人，』綠的鸚哥張開了紅的嘴吧：『當心太得意忘形，就露出了後面的尾巴！』</p>
<p>一　賣唱的</p>
<p>悽悽惻惻的絃聲中，那賣唱的嬌娃。又重抱起琵琶。</p>
<p>『啊！姑娘，別再舊調重彈，請你換一個吧！』</p>
<p>三　燈罩</p>
<p>那盞燈的光輝太暗，於是牠將深紫的燈罩換了個葱綠的。但是，似乎仍舊不亮。</p>
<p>傻孩子，為什麽不換上一個燈芯呢？</p>
<p>露珠</p>
<p>你別輕視了那破曉時候花草枝葉上點點滴滴的露珠。須知多少美麗的花朵，長青的松柏都缺不了牠的培養和滋潤。</p>

<h3>敵人　（The　Enemy）　九</h3>
<p>— 珍珠著　宋綺</p>
<p>於是，用了最簡潔最精細的幾刀，子彈就很快的出來了。這人抖擅了一下，但是他仍是人事不省的。不過他還是喃喃地說了幾個英文字。</p>
<p>他透不過氣來似地喃喃說：『膽量，他們使我……沒有膽量……。』</p>
<p>花子厲聲呌道：『貞雄！』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『不要響。』</p>
<p>這人重又陷入於深沉的靜默之中，貞雄抓起了他的手腕，他恨不得不去碰這隻手。是的，脈搏雖然若有若無，微弱得很，可是很有希望再活下去，如果他要這人活下去的話。</p>
<p>他想：『可是我真不想呌這個人再活着。』</p>
<p>他對花子說：『不要再用麻醉藥了。』</p>
<p>他毫不停留地轉過身來，揀了一個小藥瓶，將藥裝滿了一個注射器，注射進病人的左臂。放下了針，他又提起了這人的手腕。在他手指下的脈搏，跳了一兩次以後，就有力起來。</p>
<p>他嘆了一口氣，對花子說：『這人活得成了。』</p>
<p>那個年輕的人醒過來了，軟弱得很，當他看見了他是在什麽地方時，他的藍眼睛所表示出來的恐懼，使花子感到非向他道歉不可。她親自服侍他，因為沒有一個傭人肯走進這間房間。</p>
<p>當她第一次走進來時，她看見他正積集了他全部微弱的體力，準備一些可怕的事的來臨。</p>
<p>她輕輕地請示他道：『不要害怕。』</p>
<p>他喘息道：『怎麼……你會講英語？』</p>
<p>她答道：『我曾在美國住過很久。』</p>
<p>她見他很想再說話，可是沒有力氣再說了，所以她就跪下來，用一隻磁湯匙溫和地餵他吃。他雖不情願，仍吃了下去。</p>
<p>『你就會強壯起來的，』她說，雖然她並不歡喜他，可是看了他這種軟弱的樣子，覺得不得不去安慰他。</p>
<p>他沒有回答。</p>
<p>在開刀以後的第三天，貞雄走了進來，他看見這年輕的人已坐了起來，他的臉因用力而變得毫無血色。</p>
<p>貞雄喊道：『睡下去，你難道要死嗎？』</p>
<p>他溫和而又堅決地逼那人躺下去後，再看了一次傷口。他責備道：『你做這種事，就是要害死你自己。』</p>
<p>這孩子囁嚅道：『你預備把我怎麽樣？是不是預備把我交給警察？』他現在看起來好像祇有十七歲的樣子。</p>
<p>貞雄等了好一會都不回答他。他看完了傷口，再將那綢的棉被替他蓋上。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>小教聯進會的獻</h3>
<p>— 漢達</p>
<p>上海市小學教師聯合進修會成立以來，雖僅數月，但是已經有了一些很顯著的成就。其中值得介紹的有下列幾項：</p>
<p>（一）教師之間的合作　某校教師之中有五六人，平日不但面和心不和，而且你猜我忌，互相傾軋，把不得別人出個亂，心中才覺得舒服。後來其中有一位，經友人的介紹，到進修會裏來聽演講，居然受了很大的感動。第二星期，他位了兩位面和心不和的同事，一塊兒去聽講。他們也得到了不少精神上的鼓勵和常識上的啟發，才知道過去的錯誤，彼此陪了不是，做了朋友。現在那五六位「冤家」都做了會員，向會眾報告他們從前的苦悶，和現在相帮相助的新生活狀况。全體會員聽了，沒一個不替他們高興。這簡直像基督教奮興會中最有力的見證。像這一類的見證，據該會會員告訴我，已經有了好幾起了。我雖然不是小學教師，也不是會員，只是聯進會裏的一個講員吧了。聽了這種見證，不由得興奮起來。我覺得聯進會即使沒有其他的貢獻，而能勸勉各會員學校的同事們都肯精誠合作，所以教育，即此一點，已足證明這種小教團體的值得倡導了。</p>
<p>（二）校長與教師的聯絡　一般地說來，教師與校長似乎老站在敵對的地位。不是校長不滿意教員，便是教員說校長的壞話。為了雙方的地位不同，各人都戴着一副偏見和犯忌的藍眼鏡，以致隔膜重重，無法了解對方的真意，甚至把善意也會曲解而為惡意，這真是校長與教員之間很不幸的一件事。上一個月有兩位會員特地來看我，說他們的校長非常無理，在校內出了一張通告，命令所有的級任教員在下午放學以後，還須留校一小時，負責指導補習班。教員們大多不願意這末辦，都想起來反對；但是不敢輕舉妄動，所以來徵求我的意見。我詳詳細細問明白了以後，才知道那位校長為了學生程度太差，所以開設補習班，以免學生留級，而補習生所繳的補習費，完全分配給督課的教員。這末說來，那位校長真是一位熱心教育，大公無私的好校長，為什麽要反對他呢？他的唯一可以批評的地方，只是事前不曾把補課的重要說給教員聽，因此得不到教員的諒解和合作。不過校長既然出了通告，做教員的就應當遵行。這是教員的責任，也是教員的義務。凡是讀過教育行政，教學法的教師都應該明白這個道理。那兩位教員總算深明大義，回去勸告其餘的級任教員一起參加了補課的工作。為了這件事，有幾位校長非常贊助小教聯進會，不但鼓勵他們的教員去參加，而且他們自己也跟着教員去聽講。有一位校長甚至於對教員們說：『你們都去參加，會費統統由我來付。』教員們非常興奮，向別人說了不少感激的話，還稱揚他們的校長怎麽賢明。你想這一批的教員還會不跟校長合作嗎？（未完）</p>
<h3>重振道德運動的應聲</h3>
<p>— 澹秋</p>
<p>編者先生：貴報高揭重振道德運動，這是針對目前社會現狀的一劑起死回生的良藥。今天登高一呼之後，社會各階層一定似聽到警鐘一般，為之覺醒。不過顧其效力大，必須提倡得其法，外加持之以恒。否則今天提倡了，隔了不久，便好像不曾有那回事一樣了。我以為重振道德，要分積極的與消極的兩方面進行。積極的方面，則不外道德標準的建樹。那已有歷代聖賢的許多不朽著作詔示過我們，又經我們的國父及主席提綱絜領的提出，如：「忠，孝，仁，愛，信義，和平」「明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律」等等諸要點告誡我們，作為我們思想行動的準繩。我們只要時常溫理檢討就行了。唯消極方面，必須是非分清，揚善抑惡，毫不借假，則善者自申，惡者自戢。其辦法　以為當前最切要者，莫如　奸。我們必須向這八年來許多的奸逆，口誅筆伐，使其夫地自容，則大眾的進退去就，釐然目明。這是重振道德的第一步，不知先生以為如何？</p>
<p>（按）你的意見很是。我以為重振道德，貴在實行，不是說空話。希望大家知道尊重道德便是做人的第一個信條，要言行一致，要說到做到，倘使我自己能尊重道德，規勸人家也要一樣的，尊重道德，推廣起來，一定可以收效。至於政治方面，我想少談為妙，凡是服務社會切實的問題，很想多加討論，以盡我們的天職。（編者）</p>

<h3>Marshall to Arrive in China to Assume New Post; Repeated Meetings with Truman and Byrnes in Recent Days; Hurley Has Gone to Jingji Mountain for Recuperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall met with President Truman and Byrnes twice today at the White House to discuss his mission to China, but the content remains secret. It is expected that further meetings will be held tomorrow morning. Current indications suggest that he will depart for China before the weekend.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] According to U.S. official sources, if transportation arrangements are complete, Marshal Marshall may fly to Chongqing by special plane tomorrow. However, the names of accompanying personnel have not yet been disclosed. It is currently hoped that he can arrive in Chongqing before the end of next week.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated before the end of a press conference that he would visit Marshal Marshall again this afternoon to discuss the current situation in detail. Byrnes also said that Marshal Marshall's mission to China will receive his unconditional support.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press Dispatch] Chairman of the Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee, Barkley, stated that Marshal Marshall will be invited to testify before his departure for China, but the date has not been determined.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The new U.S. Ambassador to China, General Marshall, is being given broad authority and is hurriedly preparing to depart for China. His predecessor, Major General Hurley, after resigning, has already left for Jingji Mountain for recuperation. Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Connally, told reporters that he intends to have Hurley and Secretary of State Byrnes attend a closed-door Senate meeting on Monday to informally discuss Hurley's claim that he was opposed by the State Department and Chongqing subordinates during his tenure as ambassador to China, but does not intend to thoroughly investigate the matter, as requested by Republican Senator Wheeler. It appears that General Marshall will depart for Chongqing today to assume his new post.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] The selection of Marshal Marshall, a highly respected international figure, by U.S. President Truman as a special ambassador to China has made a deep impression on the Chinese side here, who believe that Marshall's main purpose will be to study the Chinese military situation, especially as it relates to the international situation. After Marshall's investigation, if he supports the proposal of the U.S. military remaining in China to await the repatriation of Japanese troops, it could reduce agitation from the Chinese side demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. According to proponents of this view, if U.S. troops withdraw abruptly, the chaos in China will be ten times greater than it is today, and the partitioned situation will in essence become even more extensive. Marshal Marshall's report to President Truman will be used as a basis for clearly defining a far-reaching and unwavering U.S. policy toward China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th Dispatch] The news of Marshall's appointment has overshadowed the news of Hurley's resignation. People in Chongqing generally acknowledge the seriousness of the situation here and feel that General Marshall will be able to make a decisive decision regarding the presence or departure of U.S. troops in North China. Many foreigners in Chongqing view Marshall's mission as clarifying to all relevant parties that the United States is extremely concerned about China's future and will never endorse any attempts to establish separate governments in the Northeast provinces, Inner Mongolia, or Xinjiang. This appointment further proves the importance and seriousness of the Chinese situation. Generally, people share this view and everyone says that the United States intends to support the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's sovereignty and independence, which has been fully demonstrated.</p>
<h3>Truman Selects Marshall Primarily for Military Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th Dispatch] It is still difficult to know exactly what policy Marshall should implement in China, but Marshall enjoys a high reputation both internationally and domestically, has a deep friendship with Truman, and is highly trusted by him. In this regard, Marshall has an advantage over Hurley. President Truman's appointment of Marshall, who has spent his entire life in military service, as a special envoy indicates that the United States believes that the current problem facing the United States in China is primarily a military problem. As Marshall has the great reputation of a military statesman, he is most qualified to help solve this problem. After Marshall arrives in China, he will be able to provide General Wedemeyer with great spiritual support and policy guidance, as General Wedemeyer was a capable subordinate of Marshall when he was in the War Department. Marshall's appointment as special envoy to China will be widely supported in the United States. U.S. Newsweek stated that Secretary of State Byrnes is very busy today holding talks with the Army Department and the Navy Department regarding U.S. policy toward China. Marshall has already met Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as they met during the Cairo Conference. From Marshall's recent report, which provided a detailed analysis of the Chinese situation, it can be seen that he is very familiar with China's military problems. Therefore, his mission to China has great significance for the future development of Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>Further Dispatch: Marshall will celebrate his 65th birthday next month, but he is still like a good soldier. After retiring for a week, he was asked by President Truman to serve as his special envoy to China and immediately agreed without hesitation. According to those familiar with Marshal Marshall, one of Marshall's most prominent qualities is that he has only one goal: the national interest. It is said that Marshal Marshall is not interested in politics or fond of wealth and vanity. The Marshal does not have the bad habit of being arbitrary; he only values hard work and dislikes any mixed matters. He is kind by nature but also has a strict military efficiency mindset with high expectations. He has confidence but also humor and is full of wisdom. He values discipline, speaks in a low and fast voice, and has an excellent memory. He can strongly remember various facts and often speaks about military details and figures without notes. During his five years as Chief of Staff of the Army, Marshal Marshall maintained an excellent relationship with Congress and earned its trust and respect.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Tells Reporters U.S. Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged; Both Houses Demand Investigation of U.S. Diplomatic Personnel</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Secretary of State Byrnes, on the 28th, told reporters that U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged, and said that he had spoken with President Truman and General Marshall for about an hour today. When Marshall will depart for China has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Members of both houses of Congress today unanimously demanded an investigation of U.S. foreign policy and diplomatic personnel.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Dispatch] Hurley's criticism of the State Department is unprecedented in American history. Although he did not name names, it was clearly aimed at figures in the State Department's Far Eastern Division and China Division. It is said that after the ambassador purged pro-Communist elements from his embassy in China, these two divisions continued to obstruct the reports that the ambassador sent to the U.S. government from China.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department Announces List of Career Diplomats</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press Dispatch] The U.S. State Department announced that after Ambassador Hurley arrived at his post, there were a total of ten career diplomats in the U.S. Embassy in China. Byrnes pointed out that Acheson, currently a political advisor to MacArthur, and his assistant Schoenfeld, as well as three others currently serving in the State Department's China Division, namely John Carter Vincent (Deputy Director), Rheinhardt, and Drumright. Others include Smith, First Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, Davis, Second Secretary, Loudon, currently employed by the State Department, and Sprouse, currently the U.S. Consul in Kunming, and Heintzleman, the U.S. Consul in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] After Hurley issued his resignation statement, Republican leader Senator Wheeler stated that the actions of some of the diplomatic personnel Hurley accused were close to treason. He will propose a motion to establish a special committee of five to thoroughly examine the activities, administration, and service personnel of the State Department, and in particular, to investigate the extent to which State Department officials "sympathize with communist theory."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press Dispatch] Republican Congressman Curtis demanded that the Secretary of State "remove all communists and near-communist elements in the State Department."</p>
<p>[United Press, Dallas, 29th Dispatch] Former commander of the China Theater Air Force, Major General Chennault, stated that the certain permanent diplomats that Hurley referred to who interfered with American policy should be handed over to civil courts for trial.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] MacArthur's political advisor, Acheson, who previously served in the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing, reportedly has no comment on Hurley's accusations, but he feels honored that General Marshall is now entering the diplomatic world.</p>
<p>Hurley Publicly Announces He Helped Facilitate Sino-Soviet Treaty</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Hurley announced today that the policy announced by the United States, namely unifying all anti-Japanese forces in China and supporting the Chinese people's hope for a "free, unified, and democratic government," is "undoubtedly" supported by the British and Soviet governments. He also stated that this policy has been opposed and undermined by certain American diplomats and "imperialist civil servants" from Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Asia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th Dispatch] After resigning as ambassador to China, Hurley gave his first public speech today at the National Press Club here, saying that the Sino-Soviet rapprochement that led to the signing of a treaty this summer was facilitated by him. "The Soviet Union has always said that the Chinese Communist Party is not actually a communist party," and the Soviet Union has not supported the CCP. According to Hurley, the Soviet Union supports the Chinese National Government and the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and strongly stated that the Soviet Union is willing to establish closer and more amicable relations with China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Hurley recently stated that he currently has no political ambitions and has not discussed with anyone whether he will participate in the presidential race in 1948.</p>
<p>British Parliament and Press Concerned About Situation in China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th Dispatch] The British Parliament and the press are extremely concerned about the situation in China due to Hurley's sudden resignation. During today's House of Commons meeting, questions were also raised about the situation in China. Member of Parliament Osborne asked Foreign Secretary Bevin whether the British government, in view of the current situation in China and the significant impact on British trade interests with China, has made any statement on the matter. Bevin replied that the British government believes that this is an internal matter that needs to be resolved by China itself, and at the same time, he hopes that the Chinese problem can be resolved.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th Dispatch] London newspapers have adopted a rather calm attitude toward the resignation of U.S. Ambassador to China Hurley.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters Jin County; Residents Cheer in the Streets, Asking About Chairman's Well-being</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 29th Dispatch] It is reported that the National Army is heading straight for Shenyang and is now less than 300 li from the city walls.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jin County, 28th Dispatch] The National Army advanced to Jin County on the 26th, capturing over 100 aircraft and countless supplies. It is said that more than 70 of the aircraft are still in good working order. When the National Army entered the city of Jin County, residents cheered in the streets, and the whole city looked up to the National Army's majesty. Many elderly people were moved to tears, repeatedly asking about Chairman Chiang's well-being. The three major bridges over the Xiaoling River between Jinxi and Jin County were all destroyed by the Communist army and are currently being repaired. The mayor of Jin County has been replaced by Han [ ] appointed by the central government, who entered Jin County at 5:00 AM on the 26th to make all arrangements.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 29th Dispatch] It is reported that the National Army has temporarily stopped advancing due to the peaceful entry of the Soviet Union, especially, into Shenyang, and is engaged in clearing the defense zone between Shanhaiguan and Goubangzi. It is also reported that the Communist army has retreated into the Dahushan area, 75 li northeast of Goubangzi.</p>
<h3>Editorial: An Analysis of Economic Policy</h3>
<p>— Many Doubts Have Been Swept Away</p>
<p>How to carry out post-war economic construction has been the subject of many doubts in society: Is it liberalism? Or a planned economy? If control is implemented, to what extent will it be controlled? Regarding the series of issues of prices, finance, and exchange rates, should a laissez-faire attitude be adopted? Or should effective measures be taken quickly? Since the end of the war, there have been many unreasonable and uneconomical phenomena. What is the central government's attitude toward these issues?</p>
<p>Since the Chairman and President Song successively announced our economic policies at the first Supreme Economic Council meeting, these doubts can be said to have been swept away.</p>
<p>First, the question of control: The Chairman announced: "In order to further encourage large-scale industrial production, the various controls imposed by the government on industry during the war should be lifted immediately, unless, under certain circumstances, the lifting of controls would affect the overall national economy, which may be considered an exception." President Song also said: "The businesses operated by the government must have sufficient reasons for state ownership, otherwise, the result will not only increase unnecessary burdens on the national treasury, but also threaten the stability of finance and currency." Therefore, although the establishment of the China Textile Construction Company was recently announced, its term is only set for two years. President Weng Wenhao also explained that this is only a temporary expedient, and the government has no intention of competing with the people for profit. From this perspective, the scope of state-owned enterprises is severely limited by the government. Unless there is sufficient reason, all other businesses will still be based on private operation. Moreover, the government is willing to provide substantial assistance and guidance to private enterprises, as long as industrial and commercial enterprises do not rely entirely on the government and have a sufficient foundation and conditions.</p>
<p>Second, the foreign exchange issue: The Chairman stated: "The most urgent task is to determine the exchange rate to stabilize the currency, which must be done as soon as possible." President Song also said: "In terms of commerce, we should find ways to make everything related to international trade and international exchange mutually beneficial." It can be seen that the exchange rate will be determined as soon as possible, so that future international payments and international trade will be reasonably adjusted by the government, and will not return to the scattered state of the past.</p>
<p>Third, economic focus: Is the emphasis on agriculture? Or on agriculture, industry, and commerce equally? This is also one of the issues that people speculate about. According to the speeches of the Chairman and President Song, they are entirely based on the principles of the Kuomintang's people's politics, emphasizing agriculture, industry, and commerce equally, and sparing no effort to provide multifaceted assistance to ensure their balanced development, with the ultimate ideal of enabling the people to generally obtain employment and a higher standard of living.</p>
<p>Fourth, the issue of post-war recovery: Due to various reasons, the situation regarding acceptance and resumption of work in various aspects has not been satisfactory. The central government is also very clear about this, but the Chairman said: "This situation cannot be allowed to drag on. Our first task must be to enable the people to regain employment." President Song also said: "We must embrace a spirit of fearlessness to overcome these difficulties so that the economic construction policy can be thoroughly realized." Then, after the improvement and rectification, it is believed that there will be thorough and rapid measures, and for the previously unavoidable slow and corrupt habits, and the selfish and self-serving dregs, will also be severely punished, cleared away, so that the people can get some comfort.</p>
<p>The above points are of the greatest concern to the public, so they are specifically mentioned. In passing, a few words should be added: (1) Since the government's policy does not adopt a strict state-owned policy, and in order to reduce the heavy burden on the national treasury, it tries to avoid direct operation, then those businesses that have been taken over by various regions and agencies to date should be opened up to private operation as soon as possible if there is no sufficient reason, or initially support private operation, without seeking to be developed individually by the government, resulting in suspicions of competing with the people for profit. (2) The foreign exchange issue is closely related to prices, currency, finance, and even the lives of the general public. It is hoped that a decision will be made as soon as possible so that people's livelihoods can be stabilized and industry and commerce can be smoothly developed. (3) It is not easy to clearly distinguish economic issues from political issues. Obviously, most of the obstacles now are due to the lack of security and smooth transportation. It is hoped that the government and the public can put the national interest first, automatically restrain and cherish each other, so that the entire national economy can be revived as soon as possible. And at this time when the people are eagerly hoping for governance, it is hoped that the government will invigorate and rectify the situation, accelerate the work of pacifying and clearing the countryside, and never excessively tolerate all acts of violence that endanger the foundation of the country and disturb the people's livelihood. It must be known that tolerance can condone evil, and the suffering of the people is caused by the government's excessive tolerance that cannot be relieved, which is truly upsetting. "Escaping from fire and water and ascending to a seat of ease" is what is hoped of the government.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Northwest 3</h3>
<p>— Fang Canglang</p>
<p>The Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is the Northwest's major artery, spanning Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. It's over 700 kilometers in total, and currently there are scheduled buses running in both directions every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Because gasoline in the Northwest is very cheap, with an official price of only 300 yuan per gallon, fares are also cheap, with the full journey costing only 4,700 yuan. Although the schedule is accurate, it's impossible to say when a bus that has already departed will arrive.</p>
<p>Pingliang is an important town in eastern Gansu, located 200 li north of Qingyang (originally part of Gansu's Third Administrative Region, now occupied by the Communists), the forward position in northern Shaanxi; it is also no more than a two-day journey from the border of Ningxia Province to the south. It is a crossroads where fabrics and cotton yarn from the east, furs and medicinal materials from the west, and 'black beauties' from the north or 'poppy paste' from the south, all rest in Pingliang. The former has continued to prosper since the victory, while the latter has slightly diminished its traces amidst the calls for reform in Gansu. According to Commissioner Guo Pei of Pingliang, public security in eastern Gansu has improved, but while the bandits in the mountains have been eliminated, the "bandits in the heart" still need to be purged. Those political tricksters and local bullies who rely on 'black beauties' for enjoyment, as well as corruption, are all stumbling blocks to the future of the prohibition policy. This is a small problem within the Northwest question, and the answer to solving this problem is "achieving unification."</p>
<p>Each of the Northwest provinces has its own unique characteristics. During my trip to eastern Gansu, I surveyed the prices of goods in the Jingning and Pingliang area and found them surprisingly low. Pingliang is a large city. Rice sells for only 3,200 yuan per 100 catties, pork for 80 yuan per catty, lard for 140 yuan per catty, and hens for 70 yuan per catty. Jingning is more than 25% cheaper than Pingliang. I carefully studied the reasons for the low prices in eastern Gansu and found that it was due to the following factors: 1. public security is not a concern; 2. urban and rural traffic is unimpeded; 3. no tax on simple meals; 4. no excessive taxes and levies; 5. reasonable and pragmatic price controls; 6. officials abide by the law; 7. merchants and the public fear the law; 8. simple living; 9. hotels and restaurants do not add 20% or 100% service charges. The prices in eastern Gansu are so cheap, and the travelers in our bus feel unusually relaxed.</p>
<p>Road Demolition Army</p>
<p>I arrived in Xi'an on the 15th. The first difficulty after getting off the bus was finding a hotel. Xi'an, during the demobilization period, appeared even more prosperous and bustling. The cost of living is one and a half times higher than in Pingliang. Cigarettes are cheaper, but fish is the most expensive, with a 3-catty carp selling for at least 8,000 yuan. It is said that the victory firecrackers in Xi'an brought down one bank, two money shops, and nine gold shops. The biggest loser was a commercial bank that specialized in hoarding large quantities of cotton. Officials, merchants, and refugees running from Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places to North China or Northeast China gathered in Xi'an, expecting assistance. As a result, the commercial situation reported in the newspapers was unusually lively. Regarding transportation, the Longhai Railway now extends west to Baoji and east to Mianchi Town.</p>
<p>Mianchi Town belongs to Mianchi County on the edge of western Henan. Passenger cars leaving Xi'an to the east pass through Weinan, Huaxian, Huayin, and Tongguan, stopping at Mianchi. The most severely damaged section of the western Longhai Railway is the Lingbao Bridge and tunnels east of Mianchi. According to the person in charge of the Longhai Railway Bureau, repairing this section alone will take at least half a year. Mianchi Town and Luoyang are served by the Yu-Shaanxi Joint Transportation Office, with one to three passenger cars running daily in each direction. The highway mileage between Mianchi and Luoyang is only 235 kilometers, and the passenger fare is only 9 yuan per kilometer. This is a wise measure taken by the government to facilitate demobilization, transport refugees back to their hometowns, and strengthen transportation between Shaanxi and Henan. This Joint Transportation Office is directly under the wartime Transportation Administration. The director is named Zhou Yanjun, and the staff are all young people. The drivers are specially selected middle-aged men with skilled techniques and mild personalities. Therefore, malpractices and unfortunate events such as selling black market tickets, privately carrying contraband, rollovers, and crashes have been rare since the Yu-Shaanxi Joint Transportation Office began operations.</p>
<p>Travelers returning east from Xi'an or taking the route through Zhengzhou to the north and south of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, breathe a deep sigh of relief when they reach Zhengzhou, thinking that they can finally escape hardship and take the train. But good things often face setbacks, and troubles arise within the family. Suddenly, the "Road Demolition Army" appears.</p>
<p>The masterpiece of the "Road Demolition Army" is to destroy transportation. They destroy the Xinxiang-Puyang Railway, and the Beijing-Hankou Railway is plagued by hemiplegia. The train heading north from Zhengzhou can only reach Xinxiang. The repair work of 107 kilometers from Xinxiang to Zhangde requires armed protection. Therefore, the road construction workers shoulder guns and start a battle for the road. The passenger car heading east on the Longhai Railway first departs from Zhengzhou to Zhongmu. Passengers cross the Yellow River flood area to the east bank, then change cars to Kaifeng. Zhengzhou and Kaifeng are a little less than 140 li apart, but due to the slow pace of the car and wide river, it also takes a lot of time. It is currently impossible to take a train from Kaifeng to Xuzhou because, on the eve of the near completion of the restoration of the Huangkou Station (November 5th), the Road Demolition Army was also discovered in Minquan, 79 li away from Kaifeng. Woe to those thousands upon thousands of refugees surging like tides, from the Longhai to the Beijing-Hankou, hearing that the Beijing-Hankou northern road is impassable, they returned to the Longhai, wandering around, eating everything they had, and with great difficulty reached Kaifeng, but unexpectedly, the road east was also destroyed. Most of the refugees are illiterate, but they believe in realism. The government hurried to establish the Yu-Shaanxi Joint Transportation at Mianchi Town, giving them cheaper rides on the better cars used by the Japanese army, so that they could return to their hometowns as soon as possible and avoid freezing and starvation. They felt warm and received practical benefits, so they praised the government and were grateful to the government. After they set off, they arrived in Zhengzhou and found that the Road Demolition Army was demolishing roads everywhere, making it difficult for them to travel and difficult to return home. In the northwest wind, they took off their cotton clothes, and even the cotton clothes of their children, took out the only quilt they had, and knelt in the open space in front of the station, selling it at a very low price to maintain a low level of life eating pancakes and drinking millet porridge, waiting for the resumption of traffic to beg for a living to go home. How miserable is this scene? The cruel reality teaches the poor masses the lessons of realism. What do the one million refugees stranded in the Central Plains think? (End)</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Visits President Song to Discuss the Transfer of Surplus Equipment in West China, Denies Transfer of 700 Aircraft</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 29th] General Wedemeyer, accompanied by Vice Admiral Barbey, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, arrived in Chongqing on the 27th. He paid a visit to President Chiang Kai-shek on the evening of the 27th. On the morning of the 29th, Wedemeyer visited President Song to discuss the transfer of surplus U.S. military equipment in West China. General Wedemeyer held a press conference on the morning of the 29th, with Vice Admiral Barbey also in attendance. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Has Marshal Marshall's mission to China changed the U.S. military policy in China?</p>
<p>Answer: Marshal Marshall's mission to China is to assess the general situation in China in order to provide a reference for U.S. aid to China and U.S. military policy in China. Marshal Marshall is highly respected and has extensive international knowledge and experience in handling international issues. Few people in the United States can compare with him. His mission to China will undoubtedly receive the support of the U.S. President, Congress, and the people.</p>
<p>Question: Is your trip to Chongqing to prepare for Marshal Marshall's mission to China?</p>
<p>Answer: No, my trip to Chongqing is to discuss with President Chiang and President Song the disposal of U.S. military property left after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from West China.</p>
<p>Question: It is reported that 700 U.S. aircraft have been transferred to the Chinese government. What is the truth?</p>
<p>Answer: The report that the U.S. military transferred 700 aircraft to the Chinese government is not true. However, the Chinese government is negotiating with the U.S. to purchase aircraft and other military equipment, but no conclusion has been reached so far.</p>
<p>Question: It is said that the Chinese government will purchase the U.S. military supplies transferred by you and President Song at 30% of their original value. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: The purchase price has not yet been determined. The U.S. State Department has an organization called the Materials Clearing Committee, which specializes in assisting the Army and Navy in clearing the transfer and disposal of materials. This theater also has experts to handle this matter. The price will be determined based on cost, transportation costs, and other factors.</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that some U.S. pilots were detained by the Communist army near Tianjin, and some U.S. soldiers were also detained near Xuzhou. What is the truth?</p>
<p>Answer: Six U.S. pilots were stranded in the Communist-controlled area due to forced landings. I heard that they were treated well. I have asked President Chiang to instruct the Communist army to release them and return them.</p>
<p>Question: Former Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army, Zhu De, has made serious protests to the U.S. military. Has the General responded?</p>
<p>Answer: The U.S. government only recognizes the Central Government as the legitimate government. The United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France all take the Chinese Central Government as the object of negotiation. This protest was not submitted through President Chiang, so there was no reply.</p>
<p>Question: The U.S. military has a liaison group in Chongqing and also a liaison group in Yan'an. Does this indicate that the U.S. recognizes the Yan'an regime?</p>
<p>Answer: The liaison group in Yan'an existed when I came to China. I did not withdraw the liaison group because the U.S. military did not want to be misunderstood by the Communists. In addition, the liaison group would provide information on the Japanese army and assist U.S. Air Force personnel in distress.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Communist Troops Invading Wanping, Another Attack on GuiSui and Baotou</h3>
<p>[Beiping, United Press, 29th] According to Chinese sources this morning, the Communist forces are expanding in the vicinity of Beiping. Wanping, 27 li southwest of Beiping, has been invaded by Communist forces. It is reported that 10,000 Communist troops, equipped with light and heavy machine guns and artillery, have arrived at Fangshan, 75 li southwest of Beiping. It is believed that this batch of Communist troops came from Zhangjiakou. It is said that the Communist troops under Zhu De have arrived at Liangxiang, southwest of Beiping, and are requisitioning grain there, and enlisting physically strong men into the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 29th] According to the Chongqing office of the Twelfth War Zone: The situation in Suiyuan is becoming serious again. (1) On the 25th, the Communist troops in the suburbs of Guisui, with more than 3,000 people and many artillery pieces carried by cars, attacked the urban area from the southeast of Guisui, but were repelled by the National Army. (2) The Communist army is transferring about 50,000 troops from the Ji-Cha (Hebei-Chahar) units, and mobilizing 20,000 new recruits from Chahar, to increase the attacks on Suibao. Among them, 3,000 people have arrived at Zhaojun Tomb, 15 kilometers south of Guisui. (3) More than 10,000 Communist troops are gathered along the line from Saxian to Baotou, commanded by He Long, equipped with heavy artillery and light and heavy machine guns, and their movements have been frequent in recent days, with a tendency to attack Baotou again. Thousands of Communist troops in Dongshengcheng and other places, 30 kilometers west of Baotou, are scurrying around.</p>
<h3>Communists in the United States Make Alarmist Statements, General Chennault Says</h3>
<p>[Fort Worth, Texas, United Press, 27th] General Chennault said in a speech here that the power of the Communists in the United States has exaggerated the importance of the Chinese civil war. In fact, only about 10% of the territory and people are involved in the civil war, but if you read the news here, you will doubt that the war is spreading across the country. The Communists are spreading various false news about the Chinese civil war in the United States, deliberately downplaying the Chinese government and promoting the Communists.</p>
<h3>Smooth Progress in Sino-Soviet Negotiations, Our Receiving Personnel Prepare to Return to Changchun</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, United Press, 29th] Chinese officials sent to the Nine Eastern Provinces to carry out receiving work are now preparing to return to Changchun again due to the smooth progress in Sino-Soviet negotiations. According to news from outside the Pass, General Du Yuming's troops are currently advancing towards Shenyang. General Du's headquarters has moved from Suizhong to Xingcheng. Chinese sources here say that General Du's troops are continuing to consolidate their positions, and the speed of the northward advance has slowed down to wait for the Sino-Soviet negotiations to proceed. It is said that the Soviet side has agreed to China's request to assist the National Army to be airlifted from Beiping to Changchun, Shenyang and other military strategic locations. According to news from Xuzhou, fierce fighting has broken out at Hanzhuang, 30 li north of the intersection of the Longhai and Jinpu railways. The Communist army is fiercely attacking the station in an attempt to cut off the Jinpu Line, and the National Army has also inflicted heavy blows on them.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] Northeast Security Deputy Commander Liang Huasheng recently arrived in Chongqing and plans to take office in the middle of next month.

<h3>Soviet Union Opposes Trusteeship, UN Preparatory Committee Has Decided to Establish Military Staff Committee and Political Security Committee</h3>
<p>[London, Reuters, 29th] At a meeting of the United Nations Preparatory Committee this morning, signs of divergent opinions were first discovered due to the trusteeship system. Soviet representative Gromyko stated the Soviet opposition to the trusteeship proposal. The proposal was submitted by the 14-member Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee and advocated the establishment of a temporary United Nations body to deal with trusteeship issues. After Australian representative Hasluck presented the Executive Committee's report (Chairman Evatt was absent and is currently in Washington), Gromyko stood up and explained the following points: (1) The Soviet government cannot accept any proposals for a temporary trusteeship organization because the United Nations Charter does not stipulate the establishment of this organization, so this organization is illegal. (2) The Soviet government recognizes that when the General Assembly is convened, a supplementary organization of the main United Nations body can be established, but believes that the proposed Trusteeship Committee is by no means a supplementary organization, but a substitute for the main Trusteeship Council. (3) The temporary Trusteeship Committee proposed by the Executive Committee will have nothing to do because no land has yet been placed under United Nations trusteeship. (4) The United Nations Charter stipulates that there are three types of land that can be placed under trusteeship, namely, land received from enemy countries, land voluntarily handed over for trusteeship by United Nations member states, and territories under mandate of the former League of Nations. Gromyko has not heard of any proposal for land voluntarily accepting trusteeship. As for enemy countries, they cannot be placed under trusteeship until a peace treaty is concluded. As for mandated countries, they are now members of the United Nations, so they have already complied with the principles set by the United Nations to accept trusteeship and can propose to place their mandated territories under trusteeship at the first meeting of the General Assembly, but at the same time there is no need to establish a special organization. (5) In the Soviet view, the establishment of a temporary Trusteeship Committee will not only fail to facilitate the implementation of the Charter, but will also hinder its purpose. Gromyko's opposition today was expected by the general public, but the technical committee of the Executive Committee dealing with the trusteeship system has been affected. This proposal of the Executive Committee was approved by a majority vote, but the Czech Republic, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia opposed it on the grounds that the establishment of a temporary Trusteeship Committee in accordance with the United Nations Charter was illegal.</p>
<p>[London, Reuters, 29th] The United Nations Preparatory Committee yesterday agreed to establish two main committees, namely the Military Staff Committee and the Political Security Committee. The former will assist the Security Council of the United Nations, and the latter will be a branch of the General Assembly. The Military Staff Committee is tasked with preparing for direct action and is composed of the chiefs of staff of the five countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. All countries in the Political Security Committee General Assembly may send representatives to participate, with the task of determining the general principles of maintaining peace. The Mexican representative advocated the establishment of another committee to deal with social and related events in order to promote social welfare and eliminate the causes of war.</p>
<h3>Possible Location for UN Permanent Headquarters in the United States</h3>
<p>[London, United Press, 28th] A reporter interviewed representatives from 51 countries on the United Nations Preparatory Committee and learned that there is a trend to locate the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in the United States. Eight of the representatives said they would vote in favor of locating it in Europe, seven were unavailable, and twelve had not yet decided. The U.S. representative reiterated their unwillingness to vote. Eastern European and Latin American countries will join the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Belarus in voting in favor of locating it in the United States. Western European countries are likely to take a common position with the United Kingdom and France, favoring locating it in Europe. Arab countries have not yet decided, and the Canadian representative is also unwilling to express an opinion. In order for this United Nations to be located in the United States, it needs a two-thirds majority, that is, 34 votes, to pass.</p>
<h3>Possible No Further Summit Conference, Stalin Extends Vacation</h3>

<h3>U.S. and Soviet Troops Withdraw from Czechoslovakia</h3>

He also said that most Soviet troops have withdrawn along the U.S.-Soviet demarcation line.</p>
<h3>Differing Views Between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, Serious Situation in Iran, Soviet Reply Fails to Satisfy Iranian Government, Iranian Rebels Change Direction and Advance Towards Rasht</h3>
<p>[London, Reuters, 29th] According to responsible sources in London, British diplomatic documents from Iran confirm the news that Iranian rebels have crossed the border of Azerbaijan province, but qualified observers here believe that in the current situation, the rebels are unlikely to make Tehran their target. If the Iranian rebellion expands into a civil war or poses a serious threat to the current Iranian government, what policy will the Iranian allies adopt? This is a question that people in London are generally speculating about. As far as the British military is concerned, the United Kingdom has stated that it will not interfere in Iranian affairs, but has resolved to take actions of a police nature. However, informed sources do not believe that the Iranian authorities have taken this development into account. There have been no changes in diplomatic status in the past 24 hours, and the overall situation is unlikely to continue to develop before the Soviet Union replies to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to Moscow, who sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the end of the week. Informed sources in London believe that since there is no foreign force invading Iran at present and there are Allied troops stationed in the country, the importance of the incident in northern Iran should not exceed its local nature. Hostile actions between the northern Iranian tribes and the capital are commonplace in Iranian politics. However, Moscow, at least in broadcasting and newspapers, has openly expressed sympathy for the political demands of the rebels, while the British government has expressed sympathy for the rights requested by the Iranian government. Although both countries have troops stationed in Iran, their views are so different, and this is the true seriousness of the current situation.</p>
<p>[Tehran, Reuters, 29th] The Iranian government previously requested the Soviet government to allow Iranian troops to move in order to stop the southbound rebels. The Soviet reply has been delayed, but according to officials here, the content is not satisfactory. The wording is still polite, but all the points requested by Iran have been rejected. Official reports said that the rebels today bypassed Qazvin and turned northeast towards Rasht, and their target no longer seems to be Tehran. This news has slightly calmed the people in Tehran, but the crisis has only been delayed and should not be regarded as having been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Halsey Promoted to Five-Star Admiral</h3>

<h3>Far East Advisory Council Decides on Policy Towards Japan</h3>
<p>The council is scheduled to go to Japan at the end of next month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, on the eve of his return to Australia, told reporters: The Far East Advisory Council has completed its initial tasks. The council will decide on the outline of the policy toward Japan. Great progress has been made in the three and a half weeks of meetings, and a preliminary agreement has been reached. However, regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Far East Advisory Council, and the methods for implementing the basic policy toward Japan, although negotiations have been held repeatedly, a final agreement has not yet been reached. When Mr. Evatt was asked whether the Supreme Commander would continue to be responsible for implementing the policy toward Japan, Mr. Evatt said that as the Supreme Commander, he should have some autonomy. If his hands were completely tied, he would be powerless. A spokesman for the Far East Advisory Council said that the council is scheduled to go to Japan around December 26 and return to the United States in mid-February.</p>

Signatories include Professor Curie, director of the French National Center for Scientific Research, Professor Cassin, vice president of the French Council of State, Mr. Vansittart, former chief diplomatic advisor to the British government, Sir William Brabazon, former British Minister of Aircraft Production, and Dr. Worthling, advisor to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3>US House Foreign Affairs Committee Re-Appropriates Funds to UNRRA; UNRRA Keeps Next Year's Plan for China Secret</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee has recently approved a bill to re-allocate $135 million in US dollars to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Republican Congressman Vollers today suggested that before Congress discusses the bill, former Ambassador to China Hurley should be invited to testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, because Hurley stated in his resignation declaration that the United States is using its prestige and power to undermine democracy in the Far East and support imperialism and communism. Vollers wrote to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that UNRRA's plan for China next year is kept secret, and why it needs to be kept secret is another secret. I firmly believe that if Hurley can give public testimony to the committee, we will have a better understanding of UNRRA's case.

<p>Qingpu</p>
<p>Zhangliantang Town Suffers Major Plunder: On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, more than a hundred bandits entered Zhangliantang Town in Qingpu. There were no stationed troops in the town. Although twenty or thirty young men resisted, they were ultimately defeated due to the disparity in numbers and retreated, allowing the bandits to loot freely for more than four hours.

<p>Army and People Develop Deep Affection: Since the 49th Army of the National Army was deployed from Yixing to Wuxi, part of it has been stationed in Changzhou and Jiangyin, and part of it has been stationed in Wuxi City and the surrounding countryside. The cooperation between the army and the people is exceptionally harmonious.

<h3>Indonesian-British-Dutch Negotiations Show Renewed Hope; Sjahrir Cabinet Gains Parliamentary Confidence</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th Special Dispatch] The Indonesian Information Department officially announced: When Parliament adjourned yesterday, the Sjahrir cabinet received 84 votes of confidence, with only 8 votes against. Following this announcement, there is great hope that Indonesia and Britain and the Netherlands will soon reopen negotiations. The new government now has the support of its people and is qualified to negotiate according to its intended policy. Seventeen of the twenty-five members of the newly established Standing Committee (the other eight are yet to be elected according to the regional system) met for the first time today to discuss the draft treaty. One of the provisions in the future treaty will clearly stipulate the status of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Dutch Authorities Clarify Position</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] It is reported that Dr. Logeman recently met with British newspaper reporters and expressed the view that Dutch troops should land in Java immediately to help suppress the rebellion. Dr. Logeman said that the Netherlands does not intend to suppress the national movement and is willing to cooperate with it. However, the prerequisite is to restore order in the area and confiscate the weapons of the rioters before negotiations can begin. The new Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir is still a respected person, and his cabinet members are also mostly capable, unlike Sukarno, who colluded with the Japanese. We are willing to treat Sjahrir as the leader of the Indonesian national movement and negotiate with him, but we do not intend to treat him as the Prime Minister of the Indonesian Republic. At the beginning of his tenure, Sjahrir also stated his willingness to negotiate, but was held hostage by extremists and failed to do so. Now, he is demanding complete independence and separation from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which makes negotiations almost impossible. We are prepared to allow Indonesians to participate in the cabinet and parliament, and we also want them to become part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, complete independence and autonomy are not yet on the table.</p>

<h3>US Senator Johnson Accuses Government of Moving Towards War with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Senator Johnson said during a Senate debate yesterday: The United States is now moving towards war with the Soviet Union in a definite and rapid manner.

<h3>Yunnan Provincial Assembly Submits Proposal to Ministry, Advocating Distribution of National University Locations, Stipulating Regulations for Exchange Professors</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch] Our country has a vast territory, and in the past, due to transportation difficulties, the cultural levels of various regions differed significantly. The Yunnan Provincial Assembly, in view of this, specially requested the Ministry of Education to carefully distribute the locations of national universities and to formulate measures for exchanging teachers, stating roughly: Most of our country's national universities are located in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan. During the War of Resistance against Japan, they successively moved to Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou. Now that the war is over and education is restored, the relocated schools are moving back to their original locations one after another. It is believed that at this time, it is urgently necessary to coordinate the overall situation and distribute resources properly. If the environment requires it, those who have relocated may remain at their new locations. Even those who need to move should not return to their original locations entirely. In general, it should be adapted to local conditions so that university education in various places can develop evenly, so as not to cause schools to cluster in places with convenient transportation, causing overcrowding, while remote areas must travel thousands of miles to study, making it difficult to seek knowledge. Fortunately, air transport is now developed, and shrinking the earth is possible. A journey of thousands of miles can be reached from morning to evening. The problem of transportation obstruction no longer exists in fact. Therefore, the distribution area of each national university should be carefully selected and properly handled before the school is moved to meet the needs of the situation. In addition, it is also requested that regulations be established for each university to exchange professors with each other every year, and strictly implement them, so that the deficiencies can be made up for, and students across the country can receive excellent education, and the interior and borders can be developed evenly. The infusion of ideas and research of academics should have a great effect. However, for teachers who take turns serving in remote areas, preferential regulations should be formulated to compensate for their hard work and to reward their interest in serving in other places. It is said that the Ministry of Education is carefully considering this proposal.</p>

<h3>Founder of the Davis Cup Tennis Tournament, Dwight Davis, Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 29th] Dwight Davis, founder of the Davis Cup tennis tournament, has passed away after a six-month illness. The first Davis Cup was held in 1903, with Great Britain defeating the United States to win the championship. Countries around the world can participate in the Davis Cup, but it has been suspended since 1939. Davis rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Army during World War I, served as Director of the American Army Specialist Corps in 1942, and served as Governor-General of the Philippines from 1929 to 1932.</p>
<h3>Chengyou Cup Basketball Tournament: Crucial Match: Liangxi vs. Shantou; Donghua Can Secure Victory Against Feima</h3>
<p>The Chengyou Cup will feature two matches today starting at 5:30 PM as usual. The match between Liangxi and Shantou is particularly crucial. Liangxi has already won two consecutive games, while Shantou has not yet encountered a strong team, maintaining an unbeaten record. This encounter is bound to be a battle of wits and strength, with each team striving for victory. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua vs. Feima (Group A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Liangxi vs. Shantou (Group A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Donghua can expect to secure victory against Feima, as Feima is inferior in both skill and experience. Moreover, Donghua players like Jia Youliang and Han Longhai are excellent players in both soccer and basketball, and the team is adept at fostering harmony, with fans readily providing enthusiastic support, giving them an advantage in terms of momentum. Facing a weak Feima team, they can hope for a satisfactory result beyond just winning.</p>
<p>The Liangxi team certainly has excellent players, but being a relatively new team, they inevitably lack coordination. Their performance relies mainly on experience. Conversely, the Shantou team has been together for many years, relying on well-honed teamwork to prevail. Moreover, newcomer He Lide is improving rapidly, not yielding much to the veteran players. Today's clash of two strong teams will have a significant impact on their future prospects, making it difficult to secure victory. It is believed that Liangxi needs all its players to be in peak condition to have a chance. Shantou must avoid panic, remain calm, and apply steady tactics, using their strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses. Liangxi's veteran players are bound to be challenged. Let's see how both teams perform today.</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the Taiwan Cultural Advancement Association (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>— You Mijian</p>
<p>(6) We feel the importance of our work and the need to actively carry it out. Therefore, we will publish a journal called "Modern Weekly" soon, and hold popular lecture meetings. We will also start teaching Mandarin Chinese, as well as other social service work.</p>
<p>Officer Chen said, "Taiwan is the nursery of the Three Principles of the People." In order to achieve this ideal nursery, we must first remove the poisonous weeds planted by imperialist Japan, and the land must be replowed. On the one hand, we must use good fertilizers from the motherland and the world—the culture of freedom and democracy—to water it. With this work, our good seeds—the Taiwanese—can grow as much as possible, and become good seedlings of the Three Principles of the People, transplanted to the mainland, and transplanted to all parts of the world. This is our supreme glory, our supreme happiness!</p>
<p>We Taiwanese are originally the best seeds of the Han people. In the long historical process of thousands of years, because we did not succumb to the oppression of foreign races, we moved from the Central Plains to Fujian, and from Fujian to Taiwan. In Taiwan, we were first oppressed by the Manchu Qing, and then abused and exploited by Japanese imperialism, but we still maintained a strong national consciousness, were not assimilated by Japan, and did not lose our national spirit. This proves that we are good seeds. Now that we know we are good seeds, we must do better, so we must improve our self-awareness. Now that we can return to the blue sky and white sun, we have the opportunity to grow as much as possible. We can be an example to others, we can build an ideal Taiwan, and we firmly believe that we can do it. But we need to remove the poisonous weeds from this nursery, and water it with good fertilizers, in order to obtain normal and comprehensive development. This work of weeding, plowing, and fertilizing is the goal of our colleagues in the Cultural Advancement Association. We hope everyone will work together and move towards this goal, assisting the government in construction, to complete the ideal New Taiwan!</p>

<h3>American Financial and Industrial Circles Willing to Invest Heavily in China, Assisting China in Establishing Large-Scale Industries</h3>
<p>Talks by Mr. Franklin, Chairman of the American Far East Trade Committee</p>
<p>[Special interview by this newspaper] Mr. Franklin, former Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been appointed Chairman of the Far East Trade Committee by the American Foreign Trade Association. He arrived in Shanghai by plane a few days ago to investigate the state of trade in China. This reporter visited him yesterday, and according to Mr. Franklin, both Chinese and American merchants hope that trade between the two countries can be smooth in the short term.</p>
<p>An urgent need to conclude a friendly commercial treaty</p>
<p>Currently, many problems cannot be resolved, leaving merchants in both countries with plans and resources but unable to start restoring regular trade between the two countries. The first key to restoring trade is to conclude a Sino-American friendship and commerce treaty. The American side submitted a draft to the Chinese government a year ago for their comments. However, discussions on the treaty have not yet been finalized.</p>
<p>Hoping to obtain reasonable guarantees</p>
<p>Secondly, major issues such as foreign exchange rates and foreign exchange freezes have not been resolved. Currently, the American government and business community are paying close attention to the measures of China's new company law. The American side hopes that the law can provide foreign capital with practical and reasonable guarantees. Before coming to China, Mr. Franklin discussed trade and investment issues with American authorities and the business community. According to Mr. Franklin, leaders of American financial and industrial circles are willing to make large-scale investments in China to assist China in establishing large-scale industries.</p>
<p>American capitalists consider two points</p>
<p>I have lived in China for more than 20 years, and China is my second home. Therefore, I must say frankly: many countries are eager to obtain American capital after the war. When choosing investment targets, American capitalists must first consider whether the capital can be guaranteed and whether the promotion of business can be facilitated. If China wants to attract large amounts of American capital and encourage American investment, it should pay close attention to these two points.</p>
<p>Foreign banks obtain licenses to operate</p>
<p>Foreign banks in this city, such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, China and London, Citibank, Chase Bank, Banque de l'Indochine, and the Dutch Bank, have completed registration procedures with the Ministry of Finance, applied for licenses, and obtained legal status in order to participate in the Bankers' Association. They will only be able to start operations after the foreign exchange rate is determined. In addition, banks established in the wartime capital that wish to establish branches in Shanghai must have been in operation for more than four years and be approved by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Marshall Appointed Special Envoy, American Military Extremely Excited</h3>
<p>Since the news of General Marshall's appointment as the United States Special Ambassador to China was confirmed, Chinese and American people here have been very excited, especially the American military. They believe that General Marshall has worked in both China and the Soviet Union, and is very familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union. The American military believes that after Marshall takes office, he will have new measures for the current situation.</p>
<p>Responding to the conscription movement</p>
<p>Responding to the conscription movement, 36 people have enlisted in the military from the 20th of this month to yesterday, and will continue to serve for three years. In addition, American soldiers who have not yet completed their service in China will remain in China to work.</p>
<p>Nine thousand American soldiers return home</p>
<p>Walterman, the Director of the U.S. Military Affairs Department, announced today that the U.S. military will transport 9,000 officers and soldiers back to the country for service in these two weeks.</p>
<p>American ship shot at again</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, Rear Admiral C.E. Eyre, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, announced yesterday that on the afternoon of the 27th of this month, when a U.S. ship was returning from Hankou to Shanghai, it was suddenly fired upon from the shore when it reached Bali, upstream of Jizhou (transliteration). The U.S. ship also returned fire at the time. No U.S. troops were injured, and the ship was not damaged. This is the second time a U.S. ship has been shot at in the Yangtze River area.</p>
<h3>Inventory of Warehouse Materials, Part of it Sold Off Early at Discount Prices</h3>
<p>The warehouses in this city, previously entrusted to the Jianghai Customs by the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property, have been undergoing inventory procedures since the 9th of this month, which is very time-consuming. It is reported that as of now, the Navy has completed the transfer of the 200 warehouses it received, of which more than 40 have been fully inventoried. The Third Front Army Headquarters, the Military Affairs Department Commissioner's Office, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Central Trust of China, and other agencies have also handed over the warehouses they previously sealed or received for inventory. In addition, the materials that have been inventoried in the warehouses are also being processed one after another. In particular, perishable items such as fish, eggs, and biscuits will be processed early. It is estimated that there are 4,000 tons of fish, 500 tons of eggs, and 27,000 boxes of biscuits in storage. It is reported that the biscuits will be gradually supplied to the market at discounted prices by the Five Companies. Eggs, except for a part that can be exported, will be temporarily retained and efforts will be made to export them. The rest will be auctioned off in batches by the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property. As for the fish sold at discounted prices, it is reported that the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property will entrust the fish market to handle it, and the price will be 70% of the current market price. The price of each catty of large yellow croaker is set at 120 yuan. Each fishmonger can sell one to ten shi dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight) per day, and each household is limited to five jin (traditional Chinese unit of weight) per day. In addition, some daily necessities such as cloth will be transported to Chongqing using the remaining tonnage of ships and aircraft returning to Chongqing. It is reported that they will also be supplied to the market there at discounted prices.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Reorganizes Baojia System and Establishes District Offices</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, considering that the urban area of ​​this city is vast, densely populated, and the quality of citizens varies, in order to facilitate management, inspection, and strengthen police prevention, is currently carrying out the following two tasks: (1) Establishing district offices, tentatively based on the existing police station district boundaries. Each district will have an average population of about 150,000 people. When the population exceeds 250,000, it will be divided into two districts, each with one district chief and one deputy district chief. It is planned to divide the city into 53 districts. (2) Reorganizing the Baojia system, in accordance with the Municipal Organization Law and with reference to the actual situation in this city, the reorganization will be based on 30 households as a jia.

The main points were: (1) The military reorganization conference has passed a plan to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of the national army. There are no major security problems in the Jiangnan area. The surrender work in Nanjing and Shanghai has gradually been completed, and the restoration of order in the countryside is even more important than the restoration of order in the cities. (2) Regarding the high prices in Shanghai, he believes that there is no need to be pessimistic. Efforts are being made to restore transportation in order to lower prices. (3) He expressed great excitement about General Marshall succeeding Hurley as ambassador to China. In the future, Sino-American cooperation will be closer and more coordinated. Finally, he put forward two hopes: (1) He hopes that reporters can regularly go deep into the cities and villages of Jiangnan to conduct more general and extensive inspections and research. (2) He hopes that reporters will provide more criticism and guidance on the Jiangnan area and the Third Front Army based on what they see and hear.</p>
<h3>Truth About Russian Bloodshed Case</h3>
<p>A Russian bloodshed case occurred in a room on the fourth floor of a foreign apartment at No. 843 North Sichuan Road a few days ago. It is learned that the deceased was a Russian woman named Lupu, 36 years old, who was the mistress of a Russian man named Widkin. Because she had a new love, she quarreled with Widkin, so she mixed poison into her drink. After Lupu drank it, Widkin stabbed her head with a sharp knife, killing her. It is reported that Widkin had committed theft in Harbin in 1937.</p>

Over the East Sea, there are clouds and fog, with moderate northeasterly or southeasterly winds. Yesterday's temperature was a minimum of 55.8 degrees and a maximum of 58.5 degrees.</p>
<h3>Bars: A New Emerging Business in the City's Gold Rush</h3>
<p>Businessmen's minds are perhaps the most sensitive. They saw batches of Allied soldiers arriving in Shanghai from the sky or sea, and saw through their boring lives caused by the war. Therefore, they focused on the word "adjustment" and tried their best to bring comfort to the Allied soldiers, while making a profit. Recently, many new industries have emerged in this city, especially bars, which have exceeded 700. However, businessmen often only care about profit and ignore the necessary morality, so 148 of them have been ordered to close down, which is very heartbreaking for them. Every time the lights come on, the bars on Zhu Baoshan Road and the East Zhongzheng Road are the most active and the most numerous. Their only way to attract customers is the sign "American Soldiers Allowed Inside" given to them by the US military authorities. The second is the music and the dozens of "English-speaking" dancing girls—"bar girls". As for the drinks sold, beer is the most popular. An Anle Palace can sell about 20 cases a day.</p>
<p>There are also many bars on Xiafei Road, Albert Road, East Broadway Road, and Tilanqiao. However, the business is slightly worse than that on East Zhongzheng Road. The hosts are mostly Jewish, but the types of drinks sold are quite exquisite. As for the prices, they are no longer allowed to be set arbitrarily as they were at the beginning. This is due to the warning effect of "American Soldiers Not Allowed Inside". Now the price of beer is between 400 and 700 yuan, and the price of brandy and whiskey is between 700 and 1,200 yuan per glass.</p>
<p>In the bars, you can see all kinds of patterns. Soldiers like to drink, and they are not willing to put down their glasses unless they are drunk. Therefore, at 11:30 every night, many American military police go to the bars to patrol and send the drunk soldiers back. Otherwise, they will simply fall asleep until they wake up.</p>
<p>There are also a large number of people who live off the bars. They sell paper flowers or other small items to earn a small profit. Of course, rickshaw drivers are also included.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities have felt that this abnormal development of bars has been restricted and those that remain will be reviewed. This is nothing more than to make the operators of the bars earn profits in a proper way. (Dun)</p>
<p>The central government has stipulated that from 0:00 on January 1st of next year, highway traffic will all be changed to driving on the right. Various circles have not yet understood the reasons and methods for changing to driving on the right. The following is an exploration of the reasons from the Municipal Public Works Bureau:</p>
<h3>From New Year's Day, Highway Traffic Drives on the Right. The Municipal Public Works Bureau Announces the Reasons.</h3>
<p>(A) Reasons for the change: (1) Most of the cars recently imported into China are from the United States. The steering wheel and lights are all designed according to the American traffic rules of driving on the right. According to our country's current traffic rules, which require driving on the left, the steering wheel and lights must be modified first. The cost of this modification is about one-fifth of the original price, that is, for every five vehicles modified, the cost of six vehicles must be paid. Therefore, in order to save modification costs, it is urgent to drive on the right. (2) Although there are cars driving on the left and right in various countries around the world, according to statistics in 1936, cars driving on the right accounted for more than 90% of the total number of cars. In order to adapt to the trend of highway traffic in the world, it is urgent to change to driving on the right. (3) At present, due to the fact that no new cars have been imported into our country for several years, the number of cars has gradually decreased due to damage and wear. Although the China-India road is open, a large number of new cars have not been transported in. This is a great opportunity to change the direction of traffic, because it is easier to change when there are fewer vehicles, and at the same time, the accidents and dangers caused by the change can also be reduced.</p>
<p>(B) Stipulated methods: (1) Human-powered vehicles, such as hand carts, bicycles, rickshaws, small flat carts, and large flat carts, etc., animal-powered vehicles such as large carts and carriages, etc., and sedan chairs, etc., shall all be changed to driving on the right from the date of the change in the direction of car traffic. (2) Troops marching and mass parades should drive on the right to be consistent with vehicles. (3) If a team of pedestrians is mixed with vehicles, they should walk on the right like vehicles. However, the local police station or the responsible highway agency must be notified in advance. (4) Non-organized pedestrians walking on the sidewalk will not be regulated.</p>

<h3>The Bond Market Soars: Class C Bonds Approach the 600 Mark</h3>
<p>Hot and Cold Issues Differ by One-Third</p>
<p>Bond market bulls continue to manipulate, refusing to release their holdings. Individual investors with both money and stocks continue to join in, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Major players seize the opportunity to raise prices, forcing those who borrowed to sell short to reluctantly cover their positions at a loss. Market prices soar, with Class E and C bonds leading the surge, followed by miscellaneous issues. As a result, prices rise by another 120 to 150 points, with Class C bonds closing as high as 660. Consequently, Class A and B bonds also reach prices above 400 yuan. Speculation is rampant, with price differences between various classes widening to around 200 yuan. A one-third difference between hot and cold issues is also a remarkable phenomenon.</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market is sluggish as the Securities Industry Trade Association Organization Committee posts notices throughout the trading floors advising the cessation of trading. However, those who profited handsomely from public bonds are not lacking in those seeking to raise prices, resulting in a strong market following an initial dip, ultimately closing slightly lower than before.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market remains stable, fluctuating with gold prices. Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill stock is stable around 1450 yuan, trading up to 1500 yuan, ultimately closing with little change from before and very little trading activity.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Price Weakens Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. dollar weakened further due to smaller reports from the Chongqing market. However, the process was extremely stable. After opening in the morning, sellers were active, and the price gradually declined from 775,000 to 756,000. Subsequently, banks slightly bought to take advantage of the low price, providing support. At noon, short sellers were forced to close their positions, briefly reaching 777,000, ultimately hovering around 770,000. The price closed slightly lower than before, by 20,000. Gold shops lowered their gold exchange rate to 8.3 yuan per tael. Refined silver remained at 650, and silver dollars remained robust, with the asking price rising slightly to 460. Informal discounts weakened further, falling to around 13 fen.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar continues to fall with gold prices. Cotton yarn merchants are quite interested in purchasing. The situation is still stable, and the price fluctuates around 1310 yuan throughout the day, ultimately closing down 20 yuan from before. Hong Kong currency is stable, with old currency closing slightly lower by 5 yuan, and new currency remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw equal supply and demand, resulting in a firm market and price increases of 200 to 300 yuan. Flour sales are brisk, and the market is stable. The price of oil continues to fall, driven by supplies from Qingdao, declining by another thousand yuan or so. Soybean cake softened from Qingdao, falling by a thousand yuan. Soybeans and soybean cake both declined, becoming sluggish, with prices falling by 300 to 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Weaken</p>
<p>Cotton yarn sales decline, and market sentiment weakens. 20-count yarn falls by 20,000 yuan, and 16-count yarn also falls by about 10,000 yuan. Fine yarn prices remain firm due to extremely scarce inventory. Yesterday, the "Hua Feng" ship arrived, carrying 125 bales of Yuyao cotton and 15 boxes of tea from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Coal Market Stagnant</p>
<p>The white coal market continues to be sluggish due to frequent sales of accumulated inventories. The prices of white coal lumps and bituminous coal lumps remain stagnant because holders are unwilling to sell at low prices due to limited inventory in the market. Bituminous coal sees slight demand from ships and factories, with prices similar to previous market levels. Firewood continues its previous downward trend. The charcoal market is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Dyestuff Market Weakens</p>
<p>Dyestuffs are weakening because goods already procured by Sichuan merchants are awaiting shipment, but cargo ship tonnage is limited and insufficient. Furthermore, dyestuffs stored in various ports are being shipped back to the city (before the war, a large number of dyestuffs were shipped to Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Nanjing for asset safety). Consequently, Sichuan merchants and others are taking a wait-and-see approach, leading to a consistent price decline and a gradual trend toward sluggishness.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The Photography Industry Association continues its activities and increases prices without prior approval. The authorities have been informed and have issued a letter to the Bureau for suppression.</p>
<p>Mu Zengyuan of the lumber industry and Lu Bingkun of the timber industry were successively appointed to organize their respective trade associations. However, because the two industries are similar in nature, they were ordered to merge into one trade association.</p>
<p>Sheng Shuming and twelve other owners of fashionable clothing stores in the city have initiated the formation of the Rong Sewing Industry Trade Association, which is currently awaiting approval. It is reported that local guilds, such as pears, which have not been reorganized or did not exist before the war, can jointly initiate and apply for organization.</p>
<p>Maolin Wool Weaving Company has decided to dissolve after a special shareholders meeting and has already established a liquidation office.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Stated Capital Amounts</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(Continued from November 28th)</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the accusation of illegal capitalization increase by some people, I would also like to provide my humble opinion for reference. Increasing capital requires a change of registration for companies, and a renewal of licenses for partnerships and sole proprietorships. This is to obtain legal standing against third parties, not regarding the internal relationships between shareholders and partners. Increasing capital requires a resolution by the shareholders' meeting for companies, and a resolution by the partners' meeting for partnerships, before filling out subscription forms or rewriting partnership agreements. Shareholders and partners are bound by these internal contracts. The relocation of the responsible government agency has delayed the change of registration, preventing enforcement against third parties. Now that the country has been recovered and our government has returned, procedures can be completed based on the facts with the responsible government agency. How can the increase of capital received in fake currency or not registered be deemed illegal and dismissed? In recent years, apart from a few capital increases intended to artificially inflate stock prices, many factories and firms have genuinely requested shareholders to increase capital, receiving cash in the form of "fake currency" to avoid bankruptcy, maintain expenses, and continue operation and reopening. Many of these factories and firms have ultimately failed due to insufficient subsequent support and have been eliminated. The surviving ones are attempting to reorganize and seek remedies. We should sympathize with them. In addition, for newly established gold businesses, even if their capital is entirely paid in fake currency, the situation is similarly "innocent." They can be allowed to complete the establishment registration or be treated as a new establishment. How can their initial capital being fake currency lead to a blanket characterization of being "fake"? Critics also say that capital increases during the occupation period were often poorly executed, causing</p>
<p>Existing Shareholders to Suffer</p>
<p>This probably refers to shareholders who could not participate in the capital increase. I also agree. According to law, capital increase should first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their original investment. Any remaining shares can then be offered to new investors. Considering that the company has a solid foundation, existing shareholders should be given priority. During the war, when the purchasing power of currency was declining, if the assets were valued at market value during the resolution of the capital increase, they would often exceed the book value. Existing shareholders who could not participate in the capital increase due to unavoidable or non-attributable reasons would suffer significantly. Strictly speaking, the board of directors should bear the responsibility. However, this responsibility is another issue that cannot be fully discussed in a few thousand words and will be addressed in a separate article in the future. In any case, the already-received capital increase should not be discounted due to the fake currency's worthlessness. Therefore, I believe that the reorganization of stated capital amounts should focus entirely on whether there is or could be such a capital amount in legal tender. If so, the current book value should be converted to legal tender as soon as possible. If it is insufficient, it can be reduced. The procedures, timing, etc., should be simplified so that businesses can determine their capital amounts and begin reorganizing other complex matters. As for other issues,</p>
<p>They Must Not Be Resolved Together</p>
<p>For example, whether the increase procedures are legal, how to compensate for the harm to existing shareholders, how to report and pay taxes for companies with solid foundations, and how to treat laborers favorably are all separate issues. Why should the reorganization of stated capital amounts be complicated by these issues? Why should they be delayed? Furthermore, how can these issues be hidden under the reorganization of stated capital amounts and be smuggled through? Some people either don't discuss it at all, believing it is not worth discussing, or when asked about the method, they have none. When they do discuss it, they have many concerns and believe that it must be discussed thoroughly. I venture to say that there will never be a reorganization method for stated capital amounts that is perfectly legal, ideal, and practical. However, one point must be solemnly mentioned: Under the aforementioned reorganization methods, the government should</p>
<p>Consider Exempting Taxes</p>
<p>To avoid more concerns for entrepreneurs, as income tax, profit tax, and labor bonuses will cause disputes. Except that laborers should be treated individually by each company based on actual circumstances, taking both sides into consideration, the tax issues, such as capital amounts transferred due to the appreciation of fixed assets, should be exempt from tax. If they are derived from undistributed profits, the industry trade association can provide a fair estimate and report it to simplify the process. Now that the country has been recovered and everything has been renewed, with a legitimate government in place, businesses can confidently seek guidance and adhere to the standards. (The End)</p>

<p>At the tea party hosted by Mr. Zhang Daofan and Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Mr. Xu Xiaoyan, for the cultural figures of Feng City on November 28th, Mr. Xu delivered great news to those present. He said that the government had made an important decision to revise the current publishing law to implement freedom of the press and freedom of publication. He also said that the new publishing law has been drafted and is now being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. It will be implemented after its approval.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu also said that the registration of newspapers, magazines, and publications in the future will only be a matter of procedure, not a matter of restriction. This is truly an exciting and gratifying event for the cultural circles in China. The promulgation and implementation of the new publishing law will take China's politics and society a big step toward democracy and openness.</p>
<p>In the United States, in England, and even in France, all censorship was completely abolished and normalcy was restored within a few days after the end of the war. Because in a truly democratic country, newspapers and publications are the general assembly of public opinion, and public opinion is the guideline for the government to handle national affairs. In order to show respect for public opinion, the government must only impose restrictions on the people in the most necessary places and when absolutely necessary. Now our government has decided to abolish censorship and implement freedom of the press and publication. Although some may think it is a little late, it is better late than never.</p>
<p>We welcome the announcement of this good news, and we welcome the early realization of this good news!</p>
<h3>Foreigners in Concentration Camps</h3>
<p>— Feng Da</p>
<p>A few days ago, I ran into a foreign friend who had just come out of a concentration camp. After six years of separation, I could not help but feel mixed emotions. He said that he lived in a concentration camp for three years, tasting all the hardships he had never tasted before, and also saw through many bright and dark sides of life. There is a meaning of spending three years in a concentration camp is better than reading books for ten years.</p>
<p>He said that when he first entered the concentration camp, he ate two meals a day, each with only a small bowl of cold rice and some vegetables. Later, when there was not enough food to distribute, he ate only one meal a day. Because foreigners were not used to this kind of food and the amount was small, everyone felt undernourished. My friend's weight decreased from one hundred fifty or sixty pounds to just over one hundred ten pounds, and at one point all of his hair fell out. Many people in the camp had the same phenomenon. When everyone came out of the concentration camp, they all wanted to eat a big meal because they had been hungry for several years. As a result, after eating, they all had stomach pains because their stomachs and intestines could not absorb the food.</p>
<p>There were many big bosses of foreign companies and bank managers in the camp, who usually had servants all over the house. After entering the concentration camp, they had to do everything themselves, which they found very difficult to get used to. Several pampered managers and their wives were lazy by nature and were unwilling to do anything at first. But as a result, they had no food to eat if they did not do anything, so they had to raise their hands to do it.</p>
<p>I asked my friend how they knew the news of the victory. He said that they had a special "secret code" for communicating the news. Several foreigners in the camp who were sick were specially allowed by the Japanese to go to the hospital for treatment. They had a red motorcycle that passed by the concentration camp every day. Everyone agreed that if there was good news, they would wrap a white handkerchief around the car light as a signal. On the morning of August 11, the foreigners in the camp saw the red motorcycle pass by, with a white cloth wrapped around the car light, knowing that there was good news coming, so there was an uproar of cheers. But in the next few days, when the car passed by, there was no white cloth on the car light, and everyone was depressed again. It was not until mid-August, when the news of Japan's formal surrender was announced, that the car passed by again with white cloth wrapped around the car light, and everyone knew that victory had truly come.</p>
<p>In order to prevent Allied planes from bombing, the Japanese deliberately built two factories near the foreign concentration camp. There were several workers in the factory who often threw notes to the foreigners to report the news. After the victory, the factories were shut down, and these workers who reported the news were introduced to jobs by the foreigners in the camp so that they would not lose their jobs.</p>
<p>My friend said that a large truck often transported food and fuel to the concentration camp. There was a worker on the truck who could say a very limited number of English words. Everyone did not know who he was. After the victory, this worker suddenly appeared in a smart military uniform, speaking fluent English. It turned out that he was an underground worker sent by the Central Government, specializing in investigating the living conditions of foreigners in the camps of the United States and China, and reporting to the Central Government.</p>
<p>Once in the concentration camp, a Japanese man in charge of the concentration camp slapped a foreigner for no reason. The foreigners in the camp were filled with righteous indignation and went out to demonstrate as a whole, and expressed that if they did not apologize to the foreigners, everyone decided to fight to the death with the Japanese army, even at the cost of their lives. Seeing that public anger was hard to offend, the Japanese army finally called on the Japanese to apologize to the foreigners and promised that there would be no similar incident in the future.</p>
<p>There were four Japanese people in the camp who were particularly fierce and brutal to the foreigners. Everyone hated them and publicly declared that after the victory, they would definitely get them and be satisfied. Later, when victory came, the four Japanese knew that they could not escape, so they quietly disappeared and disappeared. In addition, a Chinese man who worked as a tiger also packed up and left on the day of victory.</p>
<h3>Civil Judgment</h3>
<p>— Fang Gang</p>
<p>On the black iron gate of Pan Nisansheng on Jules Plass Road, in addition to the seals of the Third Front Army, there were also a few words written in chalk. One of them said: "All the heroes have been used up, and their descendants will become human beings!" Another sentence says: "Do a good job and kill well, such a hero!"</p>
<p>Under the protection of the enemy and puppets, Pan Nisansheng can be considered a "hero" who once dominated. However, "hero hero," "where is he now?"</p>
<p>The chalk words outside Pan's iron gate are the people's judgment of him.</p>
<h3>Beyond Worry</h3>
<p>— He Yuanshen</p>
<p>Having just welcomed the victory, many young people are suffering from worry again. They do not believe in war, they do not believe in politics, they do not believe in everything; they cannot be satisfied with reality, and they cannot be satisfied with many, many things. So they worry, worry, all day long, and in fact, they themselves understand that this worry does not help the facts.</p>
<p>Eight years of hard resistance war has given the country an opportunity to grow. Everyone sees this opportunity. Young people have a unified thought, wanting to seize the opportunity and immediately turn their dreams into reality. This is a kind of good intention of young people. They love their motherland too much.</p>
<p>However, they do not yet have the strength to seize this opportunity, but they hate others for not grasping it firmly, or for not being able to quickly turn their dreams into reality after grasping it, so they cannot avoid disappointment, annoyance, and worry.</p>
<p>Growing up in this country, we do not need to criticize young people. They want their motherland to grow, and they are not wrong. But we cannot help but feel pain, watching these young people being tormented by worry, with no intention of doing things or reading books.</p>
<p>When we go to the orchard, we are unwilling to pick oranges that have not matured. When we go to the forest, we are unwilling to cut down trees that have not become timber. Water flows that are not suitable for use must be dredged, and barren soil must be fertilized. For young people, I do not want to sing the empty slogan of "reading to save the country," because this slogan was once abandoned by young people. When the motherland was in danger, in order to rescue the land that was about to fall and the fate of becoming slaves, doing something practical was a great work.</p>
<p>Now, we, young friends, have completed this work. The motherland's troubles have become how to seize this opportunity for growth. In order to make this opportunity more stable, we must seek a more solid foundation. Sour fruits should be left on the tree to wait for maturity, and small trees that have not yet become timber should be allowed to grow and flourish. Things should be put in the hands of their owners, and learning should be made useful.</p>
<p>Therefore, a more arduous task is now placed on the shoulders of young friends. We have no way to make a green apple turn red immediately, and we have no way to make a small tree grow thick, but if they do not die young, they will be the materials that support the cornerstone. Regarding current worries, if we think that we have not done enough preparatory work before, we should start doing it now. For young people, there is nothing more important than reading at present. Because the current motherland is calling for people with real knowledge and skills. For the sake of the country, we should be more rational.</p>

<p>After victory and peace, we pointed out many hypocrites, but we also saw many real villains.</p>

<p>The atomic bomb is the hero who ended World War II. Whether the atomic bomb will become the culprit that causes World War III depends on how our politicians handle the atomic bomb problem.</p>

<h3>Three Days in Pan County</h3>
<p>— Song Mu</p>
<p>The car turned left and right, going up and down the mountain ridges, finally stopping in an open space. It was still about a mile from the county seat, but the car had broken down and refused to move no matter how much it was shaken. The engine puffed out white smoke, filling the air.</p>
<p>It seemed we had no choice but to walk. Already tired enough, this made us even more travel-worn. It was already dusk when we reached the county seat. Wisps of smoke rose from the low eaves, and stray dogs barked at these outsiders.</p>
<p>A robust porter led us to an inn. The roof was very low, and several beds were arranged across a single main room. One or two sparks of light shone in the darkness, and someone was lying down, smoking.</p>
<p>Soon, the lanky driver arrived. He said he had tried his best, but the car couldn't be repaired. Our only hope was that a vehicle from the road bureau would pass by tomorrow; otherwise, we would have to stay here.</p>
<p>After a while, the porter lit an oil lamp. The walls of the room were made of woven straw mats, so when it was quiet, you could clearly hear the wind howling outside. The lamplight was weak and dim, flickering constantly. The shadows of the travelers lying on the bed jumped up and down on the wall.</p>
<p>The innkeeper had a daughter, about fourteen or fifteen years old, with two shiny braids. She often walked back and forth in the room, and people's eyes would focus on her as she passed. But she often kept her head down, silently, with melancholy hidden in her eyes.</p>
<p>After dinner, the travelers' spirits rose, and they began to talk and laugh. The smoking friend also sat up from the bed, drinking strong tea. The little girl came over again. So a busybody pulled her small hand and teased her:</p>
<p>"Hey, little girl, how old are you? Do you have a fiancé?"</p>
<p>A tea merchant next to them chimed in, pointing at me:</p>
<p>"Why don't you marry her to this young man! Look, what a great couple!"</p>
<p>The little girl's face was flushed with pink, struggling desperately. Once freed, she hurried away.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter rose behind her, and some even clapped their hands red.</p>
<p>The tea merchant didn't forget to wink at me.</p>
<p>"Hey, young man, what do you think? Not bad, right? An oval face. Didn't you notice those shy eyes of hers?"</p>
<p>Afterward, they changed the subject, boldly discussing their experiences.</p>
<p>Then they laughed lewdly. In such occasions, nothing aroused their interest more than talking about their experiences with women.</p>
<p>I can't remember when I heavily fell into the land of dreams. People's conversations gradually became sparse, and the night seemed very deep.</p>
<p>The next day, we couldn't leave. No vehicle from the road bureau arrived.</p>
<p>We were bored enough in this small town in southern Guizhou – a desolate wilderness, a desolate silence.</p>
<p>It was quite interesting. I wandered to the City God Temple in the corner of the town. At the entrance, I suddenly spotted the little girl, carrying a basket of fresh flowers with her companions. I wanted to go over and say something to her, but as soon as she saw me, she blushed and ran away.</p>
<p>Afterward, I ran into her several times at the inn, but she always avoided me intentionally or unintentionally. Eventually, she even stopped doing things like pouring water for the guests, hiding in the corner instead. The travelers noticed this strange phenomenon, and some wanted to settle accounts with me, saying it was all my fault that the little girl was too embarrassed to meet their eyes. Others whispered, "It's so funny, the little girl is shy."</p>
<p>As usual, I replaced my answer with a smile.</p>
<p>We stayed in this desolate little town for another two days. On the fourth day, a car arrived at noon, and we swarmed towards it joyfully.</p>
<p>From the car window, I saw the little girl standing in the crowd, staring with wide eyes. Our eyes met, and this time, unexpectedly, she didn't look away.</p>
<p>The car swayed a few times and then sped off. Behind us, it left a large cloud of yellow smoke and a pair of melancholic eyes that slowly expanded in my mind.</p>
<h3>Fallen Leaves</h3>
<p>— Tian Ye</p>
<p>On an autumn morning, I was walking in a lonely garden.</p>
<p>Occasionally, lightly and quietly, two or three fallen leaves drifted down.</p>
<p>I bent down to pick up the withered yellow leaf, caressing it; but immediately I discarded it again and trampled on it.</p>
<p>"Go! Withered, old leaf!" I said to the fallen leaf lying on the ground. "Let the west wind blow you into the pond! Let the autumn rain erode your useless body! The world no longer needs you!"</p>
<p>I do not sympathize with its unfortunate fate, nor do I sigh for its destiny, because this is as it should be! When a leaf is old and withered, what use is it to people, to the world?</p>
<p>Everything useless and decaying should be destroyed! Let the new rise to replace it!</p>
<p>Therefore, I also hate those leaves that have withered but have not yet fallen, because they hinder the growth of the new generation. But I know that when the west wind blows again, after many times of wind and rain, they will no longer exist in this world; I also know that in the days when the cold is coming to an end, the new generation will sprout green shoots, and they will rule the entire earth when spring arrives!</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>One. Monkey and Parrot</p>
<p>On a golden perch, the parrot is practicing speaking.</p>
<p>The monkey is annoyed by its noise and gets angry: "All day long, cackling and chattering, showing off that you can speak human language, but you don't even look in the mirror. Do you look even remotely like a human?"</p>
<p>"Hmph! Even if you have three parts resemblance to a human," the green parrot opened its red beak, "be careful not to get too carried away, or your tail will be revealed!"</p>
<p>Two. Street Singer</p>
<p>Amidst the mournful sound of strings, the singing maiden embraced her pipa once more.</p>
<p>"Ah! Young lady, please don't play the same old tune again; please change it!"</p>
<p>Three. Lampshade</p>
<p>The light from the lamp was too dim, so she changed the deep purple lampshade to a onion green one. But it still didn't seem brighter.</p>
<p>Silly child, why not change the wick?</p>
<p>Four. Dewdrops</p>
<p>Don't look down on the dewdrops on the branches and leaves of flowers and plants at dawn. You must know that many beautiful flowers and evergreen pines cannot do without their nurturing and moisturizing.</p>

<h3>The Enemy (9)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Song Qi</p>
<p>So, with the most simple and precise cuts, the bullet was quickly removed. The man shuddered, but he was still unconscious. However, he still murmured a few words in English.</p>
<p>He muttered, as if he couldn't breathe: "Courage, they make me… not courageous…"</p>
<p>Hana cried sharply, "Sadao!"</p>
<p>Sadao said, "Don't make a sound."</p>
<p>The man fell back into a deep silence, and Sadao grabbed his wrist. He hated to touch this hand. Yes, the pulse, though barely perceptible, very weak, held great hope of survival if he wanted this man to live.</p>
<p>He thought: "But I really don't want this man to live."</p>
<p>He said to Hana, "Don't use any more anesthetic."</p>
<p>Without stopping, he turned around, picked up a small vial, filled a syringe, and injected it into the patient's left arm. Putting down the needle, he picked up the man's wrist again. Under his fingers, the pulse beat once or twice, then became stronger.</p>
<p>He sighed and said to Hana, "This man will live."</p>
<p>The young man woke up, very weak. When he saw where he was, the fear expressed in his blue eyes made Hana feel compelled to apologize to him. She personally took care of him, because none of the servants dared to enter the room.</p>
<p>When she first came in, she saw him gathering all his weak strength, preparing for some terrible event to come.</p>
<p>She asked him softly, "Don't be afraid."</p>
<p>He gasped, "How... do you speak English?"</p>
<p>She replied, "I lived in America for a long time."</p>
<p>She saw that he wanted to say more, but didn't have the strength, so she knelt down and gently fed him with a porcelain spoon. Although he was reluctant, he ate it.</p>
<p>"You will get stronger," she said, although she didn't like him, she felt compelled to comfort him after seeing him in such a weak state.</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>On the third day after the operation, Sadao came in. He saw that the young man had sat up, his face pale from exertion.</p>
<p>Sadao shouted, "Lie down, do you want to die?"</p>
<p>After gently but firmly forcing the man to lie down, he looked at the wound again. He rebuked him, "Doing this is just trying to kill yourself."</p>
<p>The boy stammered, "What are you going to do with me? Are you going to turn me over to the police?" He now looked only about seventeen years old.</p>
<p>Sadao waited a long time without answering him. He finished examining the wound and covered him with the silk quilt again.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Contributions from the Small Teachers' Union</h3>
<p>— Han Da</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association has only been established for a few months, it has already achieved some significant successes. Among them, the following are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>(1) Cooperation among Teachers. Among the teachers of a certain school, there were five or six who were usually not only outwardly friendly but inwardly discordant, full of mutual suspicion and jealousy, wishing for nothing more than to see others make a mess, so that they would feel comfortable. Later, one of them, through the introduction of a friend, came to the Training Association to listen to a lecture and was actually greatly moved. The second week, he asked two colleagues who were outwardly friendly but inwardly discordant to go and listen to the lecture together. They also received a lot of spiritual encouragement and common sense enlightenment, and they realized their past mistakes, apologized to each other, and became friends. Now, those five or six "enemies" have all become members, reporting to the members their former misery and their current new life of mutual help. All the members listened and were happy for them. This is simply like the most powerful testimony in a Christian revival meeting. According to the members of the association, there have been several such testimonies. Although I am not a primary school teacher, nor a member, just a lecturer at the Joint Training Association, I couldn't help but get excited after hearing such testimony. I feel that even if the Joint Training Association has no other contributions, being able to encourage colleagues in the member schools to cooperate sincerely for the sake of education, this alone is enough to prove that such a small teachers' organization is worth advocating.</p>
<p>(2) Communication between Principals and Teachers. Generally speaking, teachers and principals seem to always stand in opposing positions. It's either the principal is dissatisfied with the teachers, or the teachers are saying bad things about the principal. Because of the different positions of the two sides, everyone wears a pair of prejudiced and taboo blue glasses, resulting in heavy barriers, making it impossible to understand the other party's true intentions, and even misinterpreting good intentions as bad intentions. This is really an unfortunate thing between principals and teachers. Last month, two members specifically came to see me, saying that their principal was very unreasonable and had issued a notice in the school, ordering all grade-level teachers to stay at school for an hour after school to be responsible for guiding remedial classes. Most of the teachers were unwilling to do so and wanted to oppose it; but they did not dare to act rashly, so they came to seek my opinion. After I asked in detail, I learned that the principal opened the remedial classes because the students' level was too low, so as to avoid students being held back, and the tuition fees paid by the remedial students were completely distributed to the supervising teachers. In this case, the principal is really a good principal who is enthusiastic about education and selfless. Why should they oppose him? His only criticism is that he did not tell the teachers the importance of the remedial classes beforehand, so he did not get the understanding and cooperation of the teachers. However, since the principal has issued a notice, the teachers should comply. This is the teacher's responsibility and the teacher's obligation. All teachers who have studied educational administration and teaching methods should understand this principle. The two teachers were very aware of the big picture, and went back to advise the remaining grade-level teachers to participate in the remedial work together. Because of this incident, several principals strongly supported the Small Teachers' Union, not only encouraging their teachers to participate, but also following the teachers to listen to the lectures themselves. One principal even said to the teachers: "You all go to participate, and the membership fees will all be paid by me." The teachers were very excited and said a lot of grateful words to others, and also praised their principal as being wise. Do you think these teachers would not cooperate with the principal?

<h3>Echoing the Moral Rejuvenation Movement</h3>
<p>— Dan Qiu</p>
<p>Editor: Your newspaper's high call for a moral rejuvenation movement is a life-saving remedy aimed at the current social situation. After today's appeal, all sectors of society will surely awaken as if they heard an alarm. However, to ensure its effectiveness, it must be promoted in the right way and with perseverance. Otherwise, after today's advocacy, it will soon seem like it never happened. I think moral rejuvenation should be carried out in both active and passive ways. The active aspect is nothing more than the establishment of moral standards. We have already had many immortal works from sages of past generations to instruct us, and our Father of the Nation and Chairman have made concise outlines, such as: "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace" "understand propriety, know shame, take responsibility, obey discipline," and other key points to warn us as the guidelines for our thoughts and actions. We only need to review and reflect on them from time to time. However, in the passive aspect, we must clearly distinguish right from wrong, promote good and suppress evil, without any pretense, so that the good will naturally flourish, and the evil will naturally be suppressed. As for the method, I think the most important thing at present is to combat traitors. We must verbally attack and write against the many traitors of the past eight years, so that they have nowhere to hide, and the public's advance and retreat will be clear at a glance. This is the first step in revitalizing morality. I wonder what you think?</p>
<p>(Editor's note) Your opinion is very good. I believe that the key to revitalizing morality lies in practice, not in empty talk. I hope everyone knows that respecting morality is the first creed of being human, that words and deeds should be consistent, and that what is said should be done. If I can respect morality myself, I will also persuade others to respect morality in the same way. If it is promoted, it will definitely be effective. As for political matters, I think it is best to talk less about them. I would like to discuss more substantive issues that serve society, so as to fulfill our duty. (Editor)</p>
