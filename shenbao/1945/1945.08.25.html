<h3 id="c2">完成民族主義　維護國際和平　國防中常聯會蔣主席訓辭 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中央社重慶二十四日電　蔣主席昨（二十四）日上午九時，出席國防最高委員會與中央常務委員會臨時聯席會　時會致詞，題爲「完成民族主義維護國際和平」，原詞如下：</p>
<p>國父遺教無上眞諦</p>
<p>現在日本巳經戰敗　無條件降　，强權的侵略主義巳彼我聯合國精誠合作，爲世界正義共同作戰而全部消滅。當第一次世界大戰吿終之時，我國父孫先生有言日：「爲萬國互助者當能有成，爲個人或一民族之私利者自當消滅於無形。」此一對全世界人類懇切至誠之格言，巳由此次世界人類更大之犧牲而益證明其爲無上之眞理。在此歷史轉換期間，我國民政府今後對於實現民族主義，和達成國民革命的第一個目的，必須有明確方針，昭示世界與全國國民，以期共同努力，完成我們對時代的使命，務期此次慘酷之敎訓，永爲世界人類所記憶，以造成中國永久之安定，與全世界普遍之和平。</p>
<p>國民革命兩大目標</p>
<p>本此意列述其切要之方針如下：　我國民革命之目的有兩方面，對外在求國家的獨立解放，對內在求國內各民族的平等自由。五十年來，日本帝國主義對我國的侵略日　一日，以致迫不得巳而有全面抗戰，因之國民革命運動的重點，應先集中於團結國內各民族的力量共禦外　，以完成整個國家的解放和獨立的一點上。而我們國民革命最重大的目標和最迫切的工作，乃有三事：第一首先要恢復東三省的領土主權，及行政之完整。第二，要收復我們合　和澎湖的失土，第三，就要恢復高麗的獨立自由，因爲高麗不能得到獨立自由，合　不能回到祖國懐抱，東三省的領土主權與行政不能完整，則國家的獨立自由就無從恢復，而抗戰的目標亦無由達到。此爲我國父創造革命的一貫方針，亦即我全國國民不惜犧牲數千萬生命，以對日抗戰之最大目的。</p>
<p>東省台灣　重入懷抱在此期間我們淮有團結國內各民族共同奮鬥，以完成這三個重大任務，而後國家之獨立自由可期，國內各民族的平等地位，亦可獲得確實保證。現在日本帝國主義巳戰敗，而無條件投降，台灣澎湖仍欲還到了祖國的懷抱，東三省領土的恢復和主權行政的完整，亦獲得了，他如高麗不久亦必能得到其獨立與自由，我們國家的獨立，也由此樹立了堅實的基礎。於是我們民族主義對外一方面的目的，巳達到了完成的階段，因此我們對內一方面的任務，就是求國內各民族平等自由的工作，必須確定方針，積極推行來實現我們國民革命整個的計劃，以期保障此次由我國民犧牲無數生命財產而後獲得之勝利的和平於永久。</p>
<p>民族平等和平基礎</p>
<p>我今天代表本黨的同志，根據國父的遺敎，說明我們於今後實行民族主義，以及保陣自由和平與安定的方針如下：第一須說明者，是外蒙古和西藏的民族問題，原來外蒙古和西藏，本目有其悠遠歷史，且其民族聚居一處，與其他宗族雜居，巳經設省之邊地逈然不同。我們國民黨自民國十三年時，外蒙古會派代表來參加祝賀，當時我們國父巳視之爲兄弟之邦，禮之爲上賓，其事載於遺敎，當爲世人所共見。我們從沒有輕視他們部屬的意念與態度，決不像北京政府時代那樣加以壓制。我們國民政府成立以來，不僅對於外蒙如此友愛相處，就是對於西藏也莫不如此。我全國同胞必須知道，如果我們忽視民族平等目由的意志，抑制其獨立自治的發展，不僅違背我國民革命的精神，且足以增加我國內各民族之間的糾紛，貽誤我建國的百年大計，亦影　到世界的和平與安全。</p>
<p>外蒙獨立決予承認</p>
<p>外蒙自北京政府時代民國是一年起，事實上巳完成其獨立的體制，如今巳屆二十五年，當此世運一新之會，正重敦　好之時，我們必須秉承國民革命的原則，和本黨一貫的方針，用斷然的決心，經和平的程序，承認外蒙之獨立，建立友好的關係，使得這個問題能夠完滿的解決。否則將使中國與外蒙古之間，永無親善之可言，其對於國內安定與世界和平，更將因此而發生重大的影響。（繼續）</p>

<h3 id="c17">敵對心理即應消除一切靜候中央處理 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>市黨部吳主任委員談話</p>
<p>上海特別市黨部吳主任委員，前日抵滬，業誌昨報，頃復根據各方報吿，針對現實情況，發表談話如次：「中日戰事發生，迄今已達八年之久，日本在我國境內，尙有人數在一百餘萬以上之大軍，且無論裝備及戰鬥力等各方面言，在我國未實施大規模反攻以前，確仍保持優勢，但終不免出於請降之舉者，實爲其錯誤之國策所致，而未能深刻認識我中華民族之靱性戰鬥精神，要亦爲其失敗之一因。</p>
<p>敵對心理即應消除</p>
<p>雖然，日本民族之優點，　不應以戰敗而一筆抹殺。本人奉命在滬工作，直至日本宣吿停戰之前一剎那，無時不與日方處於鬥爭地位，雙方所受打擊，均不在少，一旦日軍放下武器，則彼我敵對之心理，即應消除。本市市民於已往數年中之遭遇，固堪同情，但若一任感情上的衝動，對日方軍民加以輕蔑，甚至侮辱之行爲，殊非大國民應有之態度。蔣主席旣已以諄諄吿論，凡我市民，均應恪守此旨，倘有不聽勸吿，甚或蓄挑撥之事實發生，本人旣兼有政治軍事兩特派員之職權，屆時惟有行使權力，納之正軌，此其一。</p>
<p>抗戰期內，與敵國人勾結，出賣祖國，或假借威勢，魚肉同胞者，凡我愛國之士，孰不切齒，其應受制裁，亦無可置疑。惟懲治奸逆，國有常典，斷不容自由行動，檢舉·偵查·審訊·判決，亦有一定之程序。縣域時互數年，罪惡之輕重不同，亦或功過相當，依法可酌情減免者，情形千變萬殊，　可輕率措置，此其二。關于逆產問題，依法應俟所有權者宣吿罪刑以後，方得由正式機關，予以查封沒收，倘不依照手續，任意查封沒收，社會秩序必致　然，且懲治奸逆之目的未遂，而自身先構成侵佔之行爲，殊失法治國家人民應有之精神，若因公務上之必　，暫予徴用者，亦當依正當手續辦理，此其三。</p>
<p>不允再有越軌行動</p>
<p>戰爭期內，凡足以打擊敵人或足以增加我方力量之手段，當無所擇，尤其於戰事達於最後階段時，更所不免。我中央於近半年來，遣派來滬之工作人員數目固多，性質亦極不同，但日本旣接受波次坦宣言，誠意求和，滬淞一帶，又未發生反攻激戰之事實，上述工作人員，有已失其存在之義者，例如少數宣導人員，其原有特定之任務，業已失其時效，今戰事旣已結束，各地所駐僞軍，亦均已遵奉命令，維持秩序，並聽候調整，是則宣導工作，可謂吿一段落，倘有借名招搖，甚至非法接收財產演出越軌行動者，嗣後不允再有此類情事發生。至負有特殊使命之人員或各機構，均望能遵照軍委會委員長代表蔣伯誠先生之意旨，速往登記，俾免冒混，而一步趨，此其四。</p>
<p>一切靜候中央處理</p>
<p>本市各機關，各學校，各團體，其性質雖不同，但大低不出黨政軍範圍，本市黨部自始至終迄未離滬一步，市政府新任錢市長及軍警長官，亦均不久可到，其可合法接收機關學校團體者，均有其主管機構，其不屬本市範圍內者，更當靜候中央處理。比頗聞無據收權力而任意接收之事實，本人深表遺憾，且目前從已接收，將來仍須交出，徒滋糾紛，徒耗日力，以後甚望各方負責人，加以注意，以示表率，此其五。以上五點，自覺出語切直，惟爲雜持社會秩序起見，不得不爾也。」</p>
<p>又據吳氏表示，本人此次奉命襄助市政，關於今後一切施政方針，當俟錢市長暨各局局長蒞任後，始可具體決定。</p>

<p>Chongqing, 24th Dispatch: The signing ceremony for the instrument of ratification of the United Nations Charter, an international document of unprecedented historical importance, was solemnly held at the National Government at 12:00 noon on the 24th.</p>
<p>Auditorium Arrangement</p>
<p>The auditorium for the signing was magnificently decorated. The national flags of the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France were hung high on the front wall. On either side were banners with a couplet each: "Celebrate Allied Victory" on the left and "Establish World Peace" on the right. In addition, there was a golden victory (V) symbol. On the rear wall were also two couplets: "Long Live the Republic of China" on the left and "Long Live the United Nations" on the right. A square table was placed in the center of the room, on which was placed the instrument of ratification of the United Nations Charter. To the left of the document were beautifully bound "United Nations Charter and Statute of the International Court of Justice" and "Transitional Arrangements Agreed Upon by the Governments Participating in the United Nations Conference," two large volumes. Four mercury lamps were placed at the four corners of the room. Before the signing ceremony, the Chinese and foreign journalists who had been invited to observe the ceremony arrived one after another, totaling 42 people, and gathered in the room to wait quietly.</p>
<p>Signing Situation</p>
<p>At exactly 12:00 noon, Chairman Chiang arrived, wearing a beige Zhongshan suit, full of energy and radiant. Upon entering the room, he first smiled and nodded to the journalists on both sides, appearing very pleased. The journalists also stood respectfully to salute. Then, the Chairman took his seat and personally prepared to sign. At this time, the photographers prepared themselves. As the Chairman picked up his pen and signed "Chiang Chung-cheng" on the instrument of ratification, the photographers took pictures simultaneously. This great and historic ceremony then came to a close. When the Chairman signed, Vice President Weng Wenhao and Minister Wang Shijie stood to his left, and President Sun Ke and Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang stood to his right. After signing, the Chairman retired to the lounge to rest for a moment, and left the National Government at 12:15.</p>
<p>Historical Document</p>
<p>The journalists immediately gathered around to view the United Nations Charter and the instrument of ratification, and the photographers also took commemorative photos. The United Nations Charter was beautifully bound, with a light beige cover. The full text was composed of five languages, with Chinese first, totaling 27 pages, followed by English with 30 pages, French with 31 pages, Russian with 32 pages, and Spanish with 30 pages. The names of the United Nations countries were attached at the end of the book. In addition to Chairman Chiang's signature, the instrument of ratification also bore the countersignature of Minister Wang Shijie. The original text of the instrument of ratification is recorded below:</p>
<p>Instrument of Ratification</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch: Chairman Chiang attended a temporary joint meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council and the Central Standing Committee at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 24th) and delivered a speech entitled "Complete Nationalism, Maintain International Peace." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Supreme Truth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings</p>
<p>Now that Japan has been defeated and surrendered unconditionally, the aggression of power politics has been completely eliminated by the sincere cooperation of the Allied Nations in jointly fighting for world justice. When the First World War came to an end, our Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, said: "Those who work for mutual assistance among all nations will succeed, while those who work for the selfish interests of individuals or nations will inevitably disappear." This earnest and sincere maxim for all mankind has been further proven by the greater sacrifices of mankind in this world war. During this period of historical transition, our National Government must have a clear direction for the future in realizing nationalism and achieving the first goal of the National Revolution, to demonstrate to the world and the people of the country, so that we can work together to fulfill our mission of the times, and ensure that this cruel lesson is forever remembered by mankind, in order to create permanent stability for China and universal peace for the world.</p>
<p>Two Major Goals of the National Revolution</p>
<p>Based on this idea, the essential guidelines are listed as follows: The purpose of our National Revolution has two aspects: externally, to seek national independence and liberation; internally, to seek equality and freedom for all ethnic groups within the country. For fifty years, Japanese imperialism has been invading our country day by day, leading to the inevitable all-out war of resistance. Therefore, the focus of the National Revolution movement should first be concentrated on uniting the forces of all ethnic groups in the country to resist foreign aggression together, so as to complete the liberation and independence of the entire country. The most important goals and urgent tasks of our National Revolution are three things: First, we must first restore the territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity of the three northeastern provinces. Second, we must recover our lost territories of Taiwan and Penghu. Third, we must restore the independence and freedom of Korea, because if Korea cannot obtain independence and freedom, Taiwan cannot return to the embrace of the motherland, and the territorial sovereignty and administration of the three northeastern provinces cannot be complete, then the independence and freedom of the country cannot be restored, and the goals of the War of Resistance cannot be achieved. This is the consistent policy of our Founding Father in creating the revolution, and also the greatest goal of our entire nation's sacrifice of tens of millions of lives to resist Japan.</p>
<p>The Eastern Provinces and Taiwan Return to the Embrace of the Motherland</p>
<p>During this period, we must unite all ethnic groups in the country to strive together to complete these three major tasks, and then the independence and freedom of the country can be expected, and the equal status of all ethnic groups within the country can also be guaranteed. Now that Japanese imperialism has been defeated and surrendered unconditionally, Taiwan and Penghu have returned to the embrace of the motherland, and the restoration of the territory and the integrity of sovereignty and administration of the three northeastern provinces have also been achieved. Furthermore, Korea will soon be able to obtain its independence and freedom, and the independence of our country has also established a solid foundation. Thus, the external aspect of our nationalism has reached the stage of completion. Therefore, our internal task is to determine a direction for the work of seeking equality and freedom for all ethnic groups within the country, actively promote it, and realize the entire plan of our National Revolution, in order to guarantee the permanent peace obtained this time by the sacrifice of countless lives and property by our people.</p>
<p>Ethnic Equality and the Foundation of Peace</p>
<p>Today, on behalf of the comrades of our party, based on the teachings of our Founding Father, I explain our policy for implementing nationalism and ensuring freedom, peace, and stability in the future as follows: The first thing to be explained is the ethnic issue of Outer Mongolia and Tibet. Originally, Outer Mongolia and Tibet have a long history, and their ethnic groups live in one place. They are vastly different from the border areas where other ethnic groups intermingle and provinces have already been established. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, when Outer Mongolia sent representatives to participate in the celebration, our Founding Father regarded them as fraternal states, treated them with the utmost courtesy, and this matter is recorded in his teachings and is known to the world. We have never had the intention or attitude of despising their tribes and people, and we will never suppress them as the Beijing government did. Since the establishment of our National Government, we have not only treated Outer Mongolia with such friendship, but also Tibet. Our compatriots across the country must know that if we neglect the will of ethnic equality and freedom and suppress their independent and autonomous development, it will not only violate the spirit of our National Revolution, but also increase the disputes between the various ethnic groups in our country, delay our nation-building plan for a hundred years, and affect the peace and security of the world.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia's Independence Will Be Recognized</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia has, in fact, completed its independent system since the Beijing government era in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. Now, it has been twenty-five years. At this time of new world affairs, it is time to renew our friendship. We must uphold the principles of the National Revolution and the consistent policy of our party, use resolute determination, go through peaceful procedures, recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia, and establish friendly relations, so that this issue can be resolved satisfactorily. Otherwise, there will never be amity between China and Outer Mongolia, and it will have a significant impact on domestic stability and world peace. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has been unanimously passed by the Provisional Meeting of the Legislative Yuan.

Seventy-two members of the Legislative Yuan attended, with President Sun Ke presiding. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also attended. After the meeting began, the President reported that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance had been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council and submitted to the Yuan for review, and asked all members to express their opinions as much as possible. The members of the Legislative Yuan then spoke in succession, and the discussion was extremely cautious.

<p>President Sun's Thoughts</p>
<p>After the passage of this treaty, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited President Sun to ask for his thoughts. President Sun spoke with excitement and joy: "The passage of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is the first voice for the signing of a new treaty after the victory of the War of Resistance, and it is also the beginning of the entry of Sino-Soviet diplomacy into a new stage. The establishment of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union is the foundation laid by our Founding Father twenty years ago, and it is also the ideal that our Founding Father intended to establish at that time due to the environment but failed to establish. Today, it can be realized at the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, which gives us infinite excitement. The establishment of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union will not only allow our country's nation-building work to be smoothly promoted in the future, but also provide a guarantee for peace in the Far East. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is not only welcomed by the people of our country, but will also be welcomed by all countries that embrace peace in the Far East, and even by people all over the world. Eight years ago, at the beginning of our country's War of Resistance, the Soviet Union was the first friendly country to provide us with assistance. Now, at the end of the War of Resistance, there is this Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which has infinite significance. Looking forward to the future of our country's nation-building, it is very bright and optimistic."</p>

<h3 id="e17">Hostile Mentality Should Be Eliminated; Await Central Government Handling of Everything <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by Director Wu of the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, has now, based on reports from various sources, made the following remarks regarding the current situation: "The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for eight years. There are still more than one million Japanese troops within our borders, and in terms of equipment and combat effectiveness, they still maintain an advantage before our country implements a large-scale counteroffensive. However, their inevitable surrender is due to their erroneous national policy and their failure to deeply recognize the resilient fighting spirit of our Chinese nation, which is also a reason for their failure.</p>
<p>Hostile Mentality Should Be Eliminated</p>
<p>However, the strengths of the Japanese nation should not be completely erased due to their defeat. I was ordered to work in Shanghai, and until the moment Japan declared its ceasefire, I was constantly in a state of struggle with the Japanese side. Both sides suffered no small amount of blows. Once the Japanese army lays down its weapons, the hostile mentality between us should be eliminated. The experiences of the citizens of this city in the past few years are indeed worthy of sympathy, but if we allow emotional impulses to lead us to despise or even insult Japanese soldiers and civilians, it is not the attitude that a great nation should have. Chairman Chiang has already issued earnest instructions, and all our citizens should abide by them. If there are those who do not heed the advice, or even deliberately provoke incidents, I, who also hold the positions of political and military special envoy, will have no choice but to exercise my authority to bring them back on track. This is the first point.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, those who colluded with the enemy, betrayed the country, or abused their power to exploit their compatriots, all patriotic people are indignant, and their punishment is beyond doubt. However, the punishment of traitors is governed by national laws, and free action is not allowed. There is a specific procedure for reporting, investigation, interrogation, and judgment. The circumstances are varied, with differences in the severity of crimes over the years, and there may be cases where merits and demerits are equal, and the sentence may be reduced or waived according to law. Therefore, rash action should not be taken. This is the second point. Regarding the issue of traitorous property, according to the law, it should only be sealed up and confiscated by official agencies after the owners of the property have been declared guilty. If the procedures are not followed and arbitrary sealing up and confiscation occur, social order will inevitably be disrupted, and the purpose of punishing traitors will not be achieved, while those involved will have already committed acts of encroachment. This is contrary to the spirit that people in a country governed by law should have. If temporary requisition is necessary for official purposes, it should also be handled according to proper procedures. This is the third point.</p>
<p>No More Transgressions Allowed</p>
<p>During the war, any means that could strike the enemy or increase our strength were acceptable, especially when the war reached its final stage. Although the central government has sent many personnel to Shanghai in the past half year, their natures are very different. Now that Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and sincerely seeks peace, and no counteroffensive battles have occurred in the Shanghai-Songjiang area, the aforementioned personnel have lost their original purpose. For example, a small number of propaganda personnel, whose original specific mission has become obsolete. Now that the war is over, and the puppet troops stationed in various places have all followed orders to maintain order and await adjustment, the propaganda work can be said to have come to an end. If anyone uses their name to swindle, or even illegally receives property and engages in transgressive actions, such incidents will not be allowed to occur again in the future. As for personnel or institutions with special missions, it is hoped that they will follow the instructions of Mr. Jiang Bocheng, representative of the Chairman of the Military Commission, and register as soon as possible to avoid confusion and to ensure orderly progress. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>Await Central Government Handling of Everything</p>
<p>The various agencies, schools, and organizations in this city, although different in nature, generally fall within the scope of the Party, government, and military. The city Party headquarters has never left Shanghai from beginning to end. The newly appointed Mayor Qian and the military and police chiefs will also arrive soon. Those who can legally receive agencies, schools, and organizations have their competent authorities, and those that do not fall within the scope of this city should await central government handling. It has been heard that there have been arbitrary receptions of power without authority, which I deeply regret. Even if they are received now, they will still have to be handed over in the future, causing disputes and wasting effort. In the future, it is hoped that those responsible will pay attention to this to set an example. This is the fifth point. The above five points, I feel, are direct and frank, but they are necessary to maintain social order."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu also stated that he has been ordered to assist in municipal administration this time, and specific policy guidelines for the future will be determined after Mayor Qian and the bureau chiefs take office.</p>

<p>The Songhu Area Command of the Loyal Salvation Army, a special operations force of the Military Commission, has been ordered to dispatch all its affiliated Loyal Salvation Army troops and arrived in Shanghai yesterday to ensure local security. The Commander-in-Chief of the Command, General Ruan Qingyuan, has been summoned to a certain place to receive instructions, and temporarily the Third District Commander Zhang Baochen will act on his behalf. Commander Ruan has also specially appointed Senior Staff Officers Shen Tu and Sun Jialiang to come to Shanghai to assist in the work of this district, and a special proclamation has been issued, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"It is hereby notified that the Japanese government has unconditionally surrendered to us, and the Japanese troops stationed in various areas have successively laid down their weapons. This Commander has received a major order from the Central Government to lead the three armies to advance eastward to Songhu, sweeping away the enemy's atmosphere, restoring the homeland, singing triumphant songs, and jointly celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance. The accumulated national humiliation will be washed away in a single morning, but the removal of the old and the establishment of the new will still take time, and the restoration of order is even more difficult to anticipate. At this time, it is deeply feared that unscrupulous people will take advantage of the situation, incite unrest, or harm the people to benefit themselves, or damage the public for personal gain, harming the country and disturbing the people. This Commander has the full responsibility for maintaining the livelihood of the people and protecting public security, and therefore solemnly makes the following four stipulations, which must be strictly observed: All our fellow countrymen in Songhu and the vanguard troops must, in accordance with international etiquette, refrain from insulting or looting Japanese soldiers and civilians who have laid down their weapons. Violators will be severely punished. All our fellow countrymen in Songhu should adhere to their respective positions and live and work in peace. Those who spread rumors to confuse the public, or swindle under false pretenses, will be severely punished. All food and essential daily necessities needed by our fellow countrymen in Songhu should be sold fairly, and hoarding for speculation is prohibited. Violators will be severely punished. The original stationed troops in Songhu should remain in their original positions awaiting orders and should not move without authorization. Violators will be severely punished. Commander-in-Chief Ruan Qingyuan."</p>

<p>Shangguan Zhibiao, Adjutant of the Four Lines Isolated Battalion, issued an urgent announcement yesterday, saying: "Since the beginning of the Pacific War, all comrades of our Isolated Battalion have been captured by the enemy and detained in the Nanjing Prisoner of War Camp. For the past four years, our comrades have either been killed or transferred to other prisons, and some have even been sent to the South Pacific Islands to work as forced laborers. Although there have been escapes, due to strict surveillance, many are still in Nanjing, enduring hardship and suffering. I, Zhibiao, escaped in the winter of the 32nd year (1943) and joined a guerrilla unit in Jiangnan, but my longing for my comrades has never ceased. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, I, Zhibiao, have been ordered to come to Shanghai. I hope that after seeing this report, my comrades will come to the Shenbao to register as soon as possible, so that we can reunite as soon as possible and discuss future plans. The communication address is 43 Guba Road (Dagguang Society)."</p>
