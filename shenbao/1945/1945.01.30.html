<h3>民答那峨西海面　日潛艇追擊敵船　東太平洋敵船四艘被擊沉</h3>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地二十九日中央社電　日潛艇隊二十四日于民答那峨追擊敵運轍船團，予以擊沉，敵運輸船二艘，艦種不詳者一艘，各命中魚雷。又日澀田中尉指揮之日軍某號潛艇，于傍晚在民答那峨海西方發現敵運輸船團，冒敵軍嚴重之警戒，敢然突繫，發射魚雷數枚之後，敵運輸船一艘發生爆響猛炸，日軍於奇襲成功後，敵船團已呈極大混亂。於其混亂之間，日軍中川中尉指揮之某號潛艇，與松田中尉指揮之某號潛艇，乖比良機，大膽突繫敵船團，當中川中尉對該水上機母艦之敵艦施炸，而松田中尉之潛艇對敵運輸船施以轟擊，敵兩艦船均中彈炸毀，是役日方全數悠然歸返基地。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十九日中央社電　日軍潛艇長驅攪亂美本土四烽之補給路，縱橫馳驅於東太平洋，擊沉美油檀船一艘，運輸船三艘。</p>
<h3>呂宋島戰況　益趨激烈</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫二十八日中央社電　敵美侵入呂宋島第三週之戰况，益趨激烈，敵更以二師作新登陸，前後總計達七師，內有戰車二師，得優勢之空軍協力，更企圖向前進攻，刻班加新安東北部高地線，有敵軍約三師，其他二師則置於後方預備，至於以戰車羣爲主力之二師，則在空軍之掩護下，强行突入呂宋中央平原。二十六日到達克拉克非爾德周圍機場之線，以戰軍爲主力之敵軍二百，於奪取克拉克非爾德機場之一部，該突入克拉克非爾德機塲之敵軍之企圖，在確保呂宋島之制空基地，將雷伊泰、明多羅等補助空軍基地集中於此，然敵軍南下部隊在克拉克非爾德之線，已遭日軍之猛烈攻擊，且以强力砲兵陣地，於二十六日以來，連日轟炸敵軍據點，並以挺身突擊隊及白刃戰，將敵軍之企圖摧毀，至二十八日敵軍仍未完全奪取克拉克非爾德機場。又企圖向聖非爾南前進之敵小部隊，亦在克拉克非爾德南部高地錢遭日軍邀擊，而行停滯。</p>
<p>菲烏基地二十九日中央社電　日神風特攻隊，二十五日於呂宋島仁妒因灣重創敵戰艦或大型巡洋艦一艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍莫基地二十八日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，二十五日夜間對呂宋島仁牙因灣內敵艦隊羣加以猛攻，擊毀其大型運輸船一艘，驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<h3>美記者推測　日軍戰略</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　呂宋島登陸敵軍，因迄今日軍主力仍守沉默，頗使彼等難以捉摸，華盛頓記者觀察日軍之作戰意圖，闡述如次：美國國內亦知呂宋島未作大規模反攻，因而樂觀者極衆，但彼等倘得悉日軍司令部正待機出以新奇巧妙之防衛戰略時，將不知如何憂懼。日軍現在前綫顯然趨向決戰化，日軍待機出動，係有下列二因：（一）麥克沃塞軍除仁牙因以外，是否另作新登陸之問題，若不明示，則日軍不動主力。（二）爲一氣蓆捲美軍陣地，必須擇一有利之地形爲決戰場。</p>
<h3>菲律賓青年參加突擊隊</h3>
<p>仁牙因前線二十九日中央社電　菲律賓青年爲保衛祖國，於去秋組織愛國同志會，以擊滅英美爲天職，其一部份會員不堪坐視敵美侵略國土，果敢獻身戰塲，參加日軍突擊隊，突擊仁牙因敵軍陣地，收獲莫大戰果。</p>
<h3>比哈阿鮑斯在東京安葬</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府顧問比哈阿鮑斯葬儀，二十九日上午十時在此間增上寺，以廣田弘毅氏爲葬　委員長，嚴肅舉行。斯日參列者有吉田軍需相，小笠原長生子　，戴門緬甸大使，駐日印度獨立聯盟委員及印留日學生，以及其他故人知友等多數。</p>
<h3>日軍在緬戰綫　作猛烈突擊　終於黎丘將英軍包圍</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據路透社二十七日訊：伊洛瓦底戰線，日軍英勇攻擊之情形如次：於伊洛瓦底江渡河點喬克民皓最近之戰鬥，實爲日軍發揮攻擊精神之一良好例證。英印軍刻於緬甸戰線已遭日軍前未曾有之熾烈攻擊，日軍刻連夜肉搏突擊。記者於伊洛瓦底江畔，在日軍彈雨中，聆聞英美某少校說明作戰情形，日軍由下午十一時至上午三時止，繼續砲繫後，更作猛烈突擊，英軍終被日軍包圍於黎丘，形勢其急，且以餅乾充飢。</p>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　據重慶電，蔣介石氏中國戰區美軍司令官韋特米爾及美駐渝大使哈萊，二十八日廣播發表，前來多公路正式命名爲斯帝威爾公路。</p>
<p>緬甸僧人協力日軍</p>
<p>仰光二十九日中央社電　企圖奪回緬甸之英印渝軍，去年展開反攻後，已侵入北緬，最近有一僧人自敵方佔領地中逃出，傳達英印渝軍對緬甸無　民衆之暴行，使緬甸政府及民衆極爲憤激。此僧人乃密芝那西北那姆馬某寺之主持，自九死一生中來至仰光，其談述如次：敵軍人種夾雜，紀律敗壞，緬甸無臺民衆被其屠殺者，不計其數，彼等時時闖入緬甸居民住宅，見有人數缺少，則全家被殺，倘家人一名外出須即報告，時問稍遲，亦全家被殺。十六歲以上，四十歲以下之男子，全數服役，凡女子不問人種，均予携去，敵軍佔領地實屬無法生存。密芝那寺院多被炸毀，市街村落已無一完室，商店均歸敵所佔有，其隣近地帶村落靑年屢被徵去服役，若敢逃回，敵則以各稱手段對付，吾等因不爲彼等利用來此，願始終協力日軍。</p>
<h3>日軍選拔精銳　突擊培里琉</h3>
<p>予敵機塲重創</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十九日中央社電　日軍對敵軍進攻菲律賓之空軍基地培里琉島，曾使肉搏突擊隊於去年十月攻擊該島敵機場，邇來特使掘重中尉選拔精銳突擊隊，作猛烈之訓練，在培里琉島敵機塲附近登陸，對敵陣作果敢之突擊，予以相當損害，即敵軍亦公開承認，此足見打擊之深刻</p>
<p>太平洋日軍某基地二十八日中央社電　培里琉島日軍，始終以不屈之鬥志勇戰奮鬥，去年十月末，遠藤司令陸軍中佐指揮之下突擊隊，曾自帛琉本島與此呼應，突入培里琉島，予敵電重大損害。又本月十七日，堀重夫海軍中尉指揮之數十名突擊隊，自帛琉本島出動，突入培里琉島敵機塲附近，予以相當損害。此突擊隊係遠藤中佐選拔勇士數十名，猛加訓練者。</p>
<h3>銅牆鐵壁的　緬甸前綫</h3>
<p>急於侵攻菲島的美國，圖使中國本土成爲對日攻擊的陸上基地，正在雙管齊下，努力推進從海上接近中國大陸沿岸的作戰以及從來多公路運入兵員資材的作戰。正如敵將魏第馬亞·　爾坦所說：「跳島作戰不能威脅日本，必須以中國爲據點才行。緬甸反攻是對太平洋作戰的策應，在中國的戰爭才是美國本身的戰爭。」敵軍的緬甸反攻作戰乃長太平洋作戰，歐羅巴作戰的一環，隨這些戰線戰况的激化，緬甸前線當然也現出緊張的形勢。自從去年雨季中起，緬甸方面的日軍早已情手整備戰略勢態，以鐵桶似的陣容，迎接一九四五年的新春。</p>
<p>日軍主動</p>
<p>北緬地區，去年十月下旬雲南遠征軍以十一集團軍的主力圖謀奪回龍陵，芒市，開始總反攻，日軍常即予以適當的反擊，消耗其戰鬥力，遂漸縮小其前面，誘入畹町，南坎的陣地戰。日軍守備隊在八莫的突出陣地苦鬥一月，即因可由八莫邀擎美式渝軍於畹町，南坎的既設陣地。由於這些前衛部隊的奮戰，日軍始得於滇緬公路兩側配備停當。密芝那鐵路沿線及　累瓦附近，　在日軍力戰間完成堅固的正面配備。日溪正面，也在日軍先造支隊牽制敵軍於加拉頓河各及馬　山脈附近時，整備決戰態勢。總之，作戰的進還，全在日軍主動之下。在畹町，南坎的日軍陣地正面，有十一集團軍約六師，二十集團軍一師，美式渝軍一師，再加蒙米特正面的一師，共計約九師兵力，現爲企圖完全打通來多公路起見，已開始本格的攻勢，但日軍亦在增加兵力，强力邀擊。</p>
<p>敵方兵力</p>
<p>更的宛河北面的敵軍，配置四師於第一　，，企圖進窺雪鮑平原，日軍在航空部隊恊助之下，加以適當反攻，使受重大損失，至於海岸方面，日軍自動整理戰線後，敵軍始行愼重登陸，然而他們竟在無線電上大放厥詞。</p>
<p>各處戰况均甚活潑，戰車與空軍合作，積極進攻。敵機最近當和地上部隊協力，實行轟炸與搽射，投下油脂彈，圖謀燒毀日軍的陣地，並時來偵察補給要點及兵站線，頻加掃射轟炸。</p>
<p>中印緬邊境集結的敵軍兵力，約六十四萬，另有上陸作戰軍地上兵團五師，陸戰隊一師，降落傘都隊五師，計廿一萬，據傳印度境內由歐慶萊指揮的軍隊亦達九十七萬之衆。擁有如此龐大兵力的敵軍，其企圖即在侵入緬甸海岸地帶。近代的上陸作戰中，必先展開空挺作戰，或同時進行。在緬甸戰線方面，情形亦復如此，先由降落傘部隊作成橋頭堡，然後再運來空挺部隊。</p>
<p>制敵機先</p>
<p>至於爲其上陸作戰推進力的海上勢力，則爲英國東印度艦隊，此係英·法·荷·義各國軍繼混合編成的。在日軍嚴整的配備業巳完成的今日，決不輕易容許敵軍實現其意圖。事實上，敵軍的戰鬥極爲愼重，例如日溪方面，日軍守備部隊自動撤回以後，敵軍並不敢遽進，自飛機猛炸艦砲射擊開始時起，到英兵上陸爲止，費時二十四天之多，而且先在日基北方二十公里的地點戰戰兢兢的從四處進攻。</p>
<p>敵軍在其新作戰中，將徹底動員航空兵力吧。他們只在十二分活用航空兵力，並有充分的彈藥等可恃的時候才敢活動，日軍對此種戰法，就是制敵機先。即在敵軍作戰準備將成，行將實行反攻之前，擊潰其最初的行動，粉碎其反攻企圖。如是，敵軍苟欲重振旗鼓，再作反攻，勢必更須費去相當時日，而日軍在其方圖再舉時，又制其先機，迎頭痛擊。在密支那地區，日軍就是這樣將優勢的敵軍阻擋於緬北要衝之外述一月之久的。</p>
<p>待機殲敵</p>
<p>因在要道適時試作戰略的展開，日軍的補給及前後方的速絡，高枕無憂。反之，敵軍的補給線則遙遠綿延，頗多弱點。由其作戰基地密芝那，伊姆法爾，吉大港到其最前線，前後綿延三百公里，而且其間復有印緬國境的峻險，密林，河川，沼澤。且其主要補給路線，自各作戰基地出發，都只有一條，尤其在日基方面，不問是運輸也好，進兵也好，都非從印度橫斷馬猶山系，阿拉干山系及馬猶河的無數小川不可。</p>
<p>今日，緬境各地前線，敵軍的行動相當頻繁。過去在印緬國境展開的山岳戰，一入平原，即成機械化部隊登台表演的立體機動戰，戰况將日益劇烈。但此均不出去年九月日軍預料並已橡討的各作戰範圍。緬甸的日軍正以新的戰法，持機擊滅驕敵。（丸山特派員一月十三日仰光特電），（譯自一月十五日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>提高公務員待遇的商榷</h3>
<p>日來政府當局正在勵行肅淸貪污，俾得建立廉潔政治；並提高公務員待過，以資安定生活。「衣食足而後知榮辱」，吃飽肚子，穿暖身體，本是廉潔政治的前提。</p>
<p>本市新任市政長官爲革除積弊，最近也已考慮提高所屬官員警察等的待遇，几在積極計算，期於最短期內求其實現。提高公務員待遇原則則上巳沒有間題了，現在應該研究的是怎樣提高。</p>
<p>最基本的原則是給與公務員以生活上必需的物資或代價，辦法有三種：（一）全部實物支薪，（二）主要生活品用實物支薪，再給以薪金若干，（三）照生活所需全部折支現金。</p>
<p>第一種辦法是算定每員每月必需的各種物資量，分別配發，或將各種物資先折合現金，然後依照折得的現金數額再折配一種或二三種較易配發的物資。譬如各種必需物資可折合若干現金，而若干現余可購幾斗米，及幾斤麵粉等，每月便折發幾斗米或幾斤麵粉。</p>
<p>第二種辦法是對一部份特別重要的必需品，如米，麵粉，煤球，油等用實物配發，其他則折支現金。譬如每月發米幾斗，麵紛幾斤，煤球幾担，油幾斤及現金若千。</p>
<p>第三種辦法是不發任何物資，依照必需物資價格，全部折支現金。但關於折算標準，如果沒有配給劵或沒有已接洽妥常的指定的配給物可購領，則不能用指定的配給價格或限價來折算，應照一般市價公平結價。以每月一日或十五日的價格做標準。例如依照正式機關調在之物價指數。</p>
<p>上述三種辦法，隨時可以活用，物資有辦法時，發給物資，物資採集困難時，折支現金。要之，以能取得必需生活品爲原則。但第二種物資和現金一併搭付，似更較行得通。所以最好是採取第二種辦法再加以活用。如每月發米麵粉等若干（或配給券），現金若干，仍可視物資採辦的難易，予以伸縮。</p>
<p>至於給發生活品的標準，我們認爲比較合理的，可照四口到六口之家計算。如以一夫一妻子女二人四口做樑準，照一般生活推計，四口之家每月的需：米五斗（的合目前市價二萬元，配給價三千二百五十元）</p>
<p>麵粉半包（約合市價六千元，配給價三千六百元）</p>
<p>柴三擔（約合市價一萬五千元，煤球不易購，燃料概以木柴計算）</p>
<p>菜肴及料理品（的二萬四千元）</p>
<p>房租水電捐費等（的一千元）</p>
<p>肥皂等日常消耗品（的二千元）</p>
<p>其他支用（約一萬餘元）</p>
<p>以上米麵等如照市價計，總共每月約需生活費七八萬元，米麵等如照配給價計，也需六萬餘元，即使把生活再緊縮一下，或搭吃些雜糧。普通四口之家每月最低五六萬元是不能再少的。如家中多子女或父母兄弟姊妹，每多一人，至少尙須增加五分之一。五六口之家至少的需八萬元左右的生活費用。</p>
<p>各級政府對於所屬公務員的待遇，無論如何是不能離上述標準太遠。又上面是照目前市價計算的，物價變動，待遇自然也得隨時調整，每且依照各月的生活指數結算才更合理。</p>
<p>關於公務員因職位的高低，而需差別待遇時，我們認爲最低生活費應力求一律，較高職員可加支薪金及辦公費。高級職員的生活和應酬等費用，確比低級職員爲大。</p>
<p>此外，還有一點要提出，對於當地過單身生活者或不及四口的家口較少者，我們認爲不宜特別減低他們的待遇。單身或家口較少者，有的直接間接的負擔，實際也並不會少。有些一部份家眷在鄕下，有些未婚者尙須供養住在家鄕的父母弟妹等。在此計劃疏散人口之際，對於家眷在鄉間的職員，買不應歧視。而實際上家口較少者，房租水電等費，並不會怎樣減低，每口平均伙食等也必比較家口較多者來得耗費。所以對於家口較多增多他們的津貼固然是應該的，對於家口較少者扣除他們的生活必需品，是不合理的事。</p>

<p>東京二十九日中央社電　柴山陸軍次官，於二十九日之衆院預算第四分科會席間，就國民熱誠之獻金獻物，發表對國民感謝言詞如次：大東亞戰爭勃發以來，至去年十二月之戲納金件達百三十八萬九千餘件，該項金額計七億七千七百餘萬元，獻物爲三十七萬七千餘件，中日事變以來之合計，爲獻金七十三萬四千餘件，恤兵金百六十二萬六千餘件，學術獎勵金八萬餘件。按照金額國防獻金七億七千一百九十七萬餘元，恤兵金一億四千三百七十二萬元，學校技術獎勵金一千五百四十八萬除元，合計爲九億三千一百十八萬元。此等獻金獻物，均爲赤誠國民之結晶，其中更不少爲特別攻擊隊將士及前線將兵之獻金，尤不勝感激。關於國防獻金之使用，更按照寄贈渚輕旨，作整備最緊要之兵器及其他國防資材之用，截至去年十二月底，主要者巳整備飛機五千九百八十二架，戰車裝甲車二百七十九輛，各種砲二千零七十五尊，各種機關槍二千一百五十一挺，聽音機二百五十五具，探照燈百五十具，發動機七百五十八具及其他各種軍用汽車，航空器材，通信器材等。又關於國防獻品爲金屬軍刀，軍需毛中，軍鴿軍犬等類。此等以國防獻金整備之軍需資材，均供於前線及防衛國土部隊使用，直接貢獻於作戰者極大，因之對此等獻金獻物均曾加以特別考慮，於永遠遵重獻納者之誠意。如飛機等消耗兵器於消耗後，則以國費另製，仍沿用同樣之名稱，以對默納者表示感謝。又恤兵金，則用於對出動部隊，購入恤兵器，慰安設施等項。</p>
<h3>川滇民衆　反美情緒濃厚　松平報道部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，昨日下午二時循例舉行報道會議，由松平部長主持，關於內地民衆對美軍之反感，及國共問題等有所論述，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>酗酒滋事敗壞風紀</p>
<p>據最近內地來人談，重慶方面現有美軍約一千五百名，其中以空軍佔最多數，昆明約有五百人，去年十一月間渝蓉昆明等處，特成立民衆招待所，容納此種美軍，招特所內除每日供應酒飯外，尙備有女待歌女等，每星期二及五晚舉行跳舞會以示慰勞。但一天國士兵多數不明陳中國情形，雖受此優渥待遇，而於華人仍極歧視，不法行爲時有所聞，往往駕車八市，見有年輕婦女，即挾之登車　馳以爲笑樂，酗酒滋事不一而足。去年十一月中，昆明一地美軍與當地民衆發生糾紛之交涉事件，多至十四起，其中九件牽涉婦女問題，英餘爲酗酒事件，風紀之敗壞，可覘一斑。</p>
<p>美大使館失火原因</p>
<p>松平部畏於報述消息後，接續發表其個人之感想稱：本月十九日外電傳駐渝美大使館失火，翌日美軍司令部及油庫亦遭回祿，據電訊云，因係水力不够，以致延燒甚烈，但據余看來，內容或不如此簡單，水力不够當亦係事實，但一燒再燒，起火原因要非出於偶然，或者民衆方面因反美思想之過激，而出以此有計劃之縱火行動。</p>
<p>國共問題未易解決</p>
<p>最後關於國共問題，部長略謂，最近周恩來抵渝時，曾對新聞記者發表，其中指出手澤東所希望於渝政權者有四點，即（一）渝方應從速召開國民大會，實施憲政。（二）取消獨裁制，成立民主主義政府。（三）軍事趨於一元化。（四）承認各黨各派具有同等權力及地位。國民黨方面能否接受此項意見，刻尙未知，但據傳蔣氏之意，一切似仍當以政治方式解決之。</p>

<h3>日本去年度　米麥收穫量</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日農商省食糧管理局長湯河氏，二十九日於衆院預算第五分科會席上，答覆浜地文平氏之質問，就去年度之米麥收穫額談稱：去年度之米麥實收額，刻正在調查中，故確實之統計上之數字，尙未能判明，大體麥類有二千四五百萬之程度，至於來則一如日前所發表，有六干石乃至六千二百萬石之程度，就最近之實情觀，尙可稍增。</p>

<h3>吳司法部長　定期視事</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　新任司法行政部長吳頌皋氏前以奉命辦理上海特別市政府交替手續，滯滬多日，迄未正式接事。茲悉吳氏在滬業已公畢，於二十七日晨離滬來京，并定於二月一日正式到部視事。</p>
<h3>粵省舉行　治安會議</h3>
<p>廣州二十九日中央社電　最近本省各縣地方，常有不肖武裝團體於水陸交通點設卡收費·以致影響交通，抬高物價及擾亂地方治安，省府於前日召集各區行政督察專員及各縣區長與警察局長，舉行治安會議，議定確保治安及澈底嚴禁設卡征費辦法，並隨即依照切實執行，業由省府會同綏署會銜佈告。</p>
<h3>出國證明書改訂收費辦法</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　外交部塡發赴日。滿兩國之出國證明書，向收紙張費國幣二十元，茲以工料飛漲，該部賠累甚鉅，爲求挹注計，業經呈准，於本年二月一日起，每份實收國幣二百元。</p>
<h3>法境食糧恐慌</h3>
<p>百倫二十九日中央社電　德國社訊：法國食糧非常缺乏，數處地區已有即將發生飢饉之虞。法內閣已決定採項緊急措</p>
<h3>免除江寧等縣　計民派米制度　首都平價維紀會決定</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　首都市區生活必需物資平價維紀方案，經有關機關草擬呈奉表高當局批准後，該方案內包括有免除江寗·漂水·句容等縣保甲計民派米制度，內容規定每畝應交公米二斗，折合稻子五斗，以公價三千七百元一石計算收買。故此後日本僑民及工廠所食用之食米，將改由南京特別市政府會同米統會南京區辦事處負責配給。聞該項保甲計畝派米前江寗縣政府曾與米統會辦事處協議，擬承辦該項食米十五萬石，江寗縣政府並已督令各區積極展開派米工作，據悉迄今成績至爲可觀，但以現時江寗縣府僅與米統會辦事處簽訂派米一萬石合同，業已交到倉庫六千餘石，餘數仍在續繳中，至於其餘之十四萬石派米，江寗當局現時究已收進若干，將來是否緻訂合同，掃數繳淸。關於此問題，現米統會南京辦事處擬請有關當局調查該縣各區公所實收數量，予以合理之處置。</p>

<h3>日大東亞相闡明　對華新政策　盡一切努力增進中日關係</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日重光大東菲相，二十八日下午於衆院第一分科會答覆田中貢氏之質問，力陳大東亞戰爭解決之關鍵，在於中日之恊力，而日本之對華新政策，正沿此綫繼續推進，茲誌問答如次：</p>
<p>（田中氏問）此次戰爭之目的，在使中國人自覺其本位應立於大東亞之立場，而協力大東亞之建設，日本爲此目的，殊有充分把握中國民心，推進對策政策之必要，敢問政府對此施策如何？</p>
<p>（重光氏答）大東亞戰爭起於中國問題，亦結於中國問題，此爲本人前此所言。蓋此次戰爭之解決，僅由於中日協力，日本之對華新政策，正沿此錢推進，政府對於增進中日之關係，擬繼續盡一切之努力。</p>
<p>（田中氏問）中國民心之把握，在於和平地區政治之良否，是故，不但應與國民政府愈加緊密提携，尤當努力直接把握民心之施策，戰爭與經濟統制，固不可避免，但本人認爲關於在中國之統制，殊有特加考慮與任意之必要，尊見如何？</p>
<p>（重光氏答）若與日本內地一樣作經濟統制之想，當然不可能，且因中國之民政，則應採取適應中國人之措置爲所宜，但因刻下有多數日軍駐屯，故有某種程度之經濟統制手段，實有出於不得已者。</p>
<p>（田中氏問）本人認爲以期待日本人之同樣期待，期待中國人，頗不合理，尊見如何？</p>
<p>（重光氏答）中國有中國之立塲，中國人有中國人之想法，就吾人而言，充分理解並尊重中國人之立場，而推進施策，實爲必要，絕不當有以日本人之想法，强行無理解之舉動。</p>
<h3>崛內公使等　離日返任　新經濟政策即將實施</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　關於盟邦日本爲援助我國確立戰時經濟體制，强力發揮決戰總力，乃本同盟條約之旨趣，與大東亞共同宣言之精神，予以進一步之協力，爰日八十六屆會譏中，有對華實施新經濟政策之議，消息傳出，我朝野上下，一致熱望，莫不深切期待。日駐華陸海軍及大使館等現地當局，現已積極草擬方案。茲悉大使館崛內公使及上海事務所岡崎參事官，更於週前聯袂赴日，就此與日政府首腦作具體之商洽，今兩氏業於二十八日返抵上海，關於該項方案，已有初步之決定，刻正與現地軍政方面及國府當局作最後之商榷，定於最近期內，即可正式公布實施。預計今後或將設置一種經濟機構，發揮高度經濟參謀本部之機能，故預卜項新對策之實施，對我國參戰協力之增強，以及大後方之民生安定，無不均有莫大之貢獻。</p>
<h3>重光外相闡明　日作戰目標　建設自由平等之世界</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日外相重光氏，二十八日於衆議院豫算第一分科會席土，答覆蜡山氏之質疑，並關明日本公正乙戰爭目的與反軸心國戰爭目的之不一致，於鄧巴頓奧克斯會議中，已全盤暴露彼等戰爭之目的，僅在澈底擊滅日·德兩國，然我方之戰爭目的，係以建設自由平等之世界爲日標，大東亞宣言之基礎，亦即在是點也。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日重光大東亞相，二十八日午後於衆議院第一分科委員會中，對四天五延孝氏關於帝國回敎政策之質問，答辭如次：大東亞戰爭之目的，在大東亞之建設與民族之解放，於大東亞之回敎徒，大部份亦係被壓迫民族，日本自然不惜對回敎徒之解放加以全面協力。最近土耳其政府曾聲明與日本斷絕國交，但正如土耳其外長對我陳辯所稱，乃係受英美之强制要求所致，而非土耳其政府之本意，因之，此等措置，並非回敎徒意志，現已勿庸贅述。日本對回敎徒之政策，於日本容許印度納西亞民族之獨立已極顯明，日本必始終以大東亞宣言之精神，導回敎徒堅擊親和協力互相尊重及援助之方針。</p>
<h3>中央各機關　更換身份證</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　本年度中央各機關戰員身份證，業經國府參軍處統一發竣，計簡任薦任官所用用種職官證爲深褐色，委任官爲橘黃色，職員證公役動務爲湖色，至前發舊證一律作廢，如有退職各員仍有持用舊證者，一經查出，決予嚴懲。</p>
<h3>歐洲形勢與三國相尅</h3>
<p>英美蘇三國對於歐洲政策的步調，逐漸開始紊亂了；自然這並不是意外，而是意中的事。英美蘇三國前此所以能够對歐協調者，這是因爲破壞德國所建立的歐洲新秩序，以及反對法西斯蒂政權這兩點上，具有共同性所致。摧毀德國新秩序後，談到以何種理念和構想來建設歐洲的問體時，則三國就不能不陷於極大的茅盾裏。他們彼此間的協調，誠可謂「相對的可能，而絕對的不可能」。在破壞德國新秩序的過程上，就是屬於相對協調的階段，所謂設計建設歐洲問題時，就是進入絕對對立的階段了。</p>
<p>德國看見鋒芒不利時，即按戰略要求，撤兵本土，緊追而來的英美蘇三國，由於彼此間國家性格的不同便在「解放的歐洲境內」處處表現出政治上的相制相尅。美國對於歐洲的企圖，就是想以歐洲作爲金元世界制霸的一翼。這在美國所設計的戰後安全機構中，已經蛛絲馬跡可以看得出來。固然，美國在大吹大擂地主張不干涉歐洲各國，但其眞正意圖，却是藉此來牽制英蘇之深入歐洲，以求歐洲接受其政治影響，而完成制霸歐洲的野心。英國始終堅持其劃分勢力範圍的舊把戲，以保持歐洲的重要部份，藉以挽救大英帝國的沒落。至於蘇聯，正如其在戰後安全機構中所設計者，認爲劃分歐洲爲各種勢力圈的英國方法，是不合理的，始終承認歐洲爲不可分的整體，但在這個態度中，可以看出來蘇聯對歐政策的獨自遠大眼光。最近蘇聯所締結的蘇法同盟，也正是反對英國保守態度的。蘇聯也曾一再聲明不干涉歐洲各國內政的原則，但以消滅法西斯主義政體爲條件，這就是企圖建立各國內部的親蘇政權。</p>
<p>所不幸者，是處於此三國歐洲政策相尅下所謂被「解放」的歐洲各國。從英美得不到一片麵包，而只得到口頭上「自由」的歐洲各國，除掉飢寒交迫外，還受到政治上的混亂狀態。接受英美的謀略而巴特達里奧叛變的意大利，全國都陷於飢餓狀態裏。希臘與比利時，則有武裝游擊隊的騷擾，而陷於無政府狀態中。所以値得注意者，就是整個歐洲都逐漸發生强大的赤色勢力。凡是混亂，貧窮，飢餓等現象，就是製造赤色勢力的最好場所。這就是證明，蘇聯勢力或親蘇份子在歐洲各處，都日益膨脹起來。對於這種趨勢深感痛苦而担憂者，就是英美，尤其是英國。英國多年認爲自已勢力範圍的希臘，按普通常識說內外的惡果。英國承認了劃分波蘭的寇森綫，自己撕毀了大西洋憲章，而只顧向蘇聯表示媚態，藉此以求蘇聯之幫助，這只是暴露英國無節操與無能力於全世界而已。</p>
<p>偏偏事實未如協約國所想，乘其相互間的矛盾，而隱忍持重已久的德國，集結國家總力，竟發動攻勢。他們不管歐洲的中心勢力德國，而企圖決定歐洲命運的這種幻想，不久即將消滅。（林譯自十二月二十五日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>德援軍調集東綫　準備大舉反攻　布萊斯勞成堅強要塞</h3>
<p>柏林二土九日中央社電　德國社訊，德軍參謀總長賣德林中將頃向東線德軍發表宣言稱：君不可惑於東線之失地，德軍最高當局刻正實行一清晰之計劃，且確能控制全軍。德軍并無整隊或整師被俘者，德軍刻正由維斯杜拉河中游西行，其先頭部隊已抵達早已準備之新陣地，同時增援都隊已由各方出發，德軍一俟集合齊全，即開始與敵周旋，德軍最高當局將決定反攻之日期。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國社訊，據此間午報評論戰局稱：千萬德軍及大量輸重隊刻正趨東線，遏阻蘇軍之攻勢須假以時間，臨時辦法雖能免目前之危險，但我人不需要之，表面之發展，能使無經騐者驚惶，但德軍最高當局則儘量保持對策之秘密性。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍自東南經勃里哥勞猛烈來攻，已抵布萊斯勞之前，德軍曁人民製擊隊正奮力怖防，以資保衛。現主路已佈　礙物，坦克車陷阱日見增多，布萊斯勞漸已化成一要塞，無論老少均成要塞之衛兵。城內存糧殊爲豐富，飲水正設法保護中，預料日內即將有大戰。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍在蘇軍後方從事流動戰之部隊，頗能收牽制蘇軍之效此並非且前之大戰已告繼弛之謂。反之，蘇軍先鋒所抵達之各重點，現皆酣戰甚烈，尤以上西里西亞工業區·康尼斯堡迤東與東南·布來斯勞·彼森·希尼合莫爾·托倫·布朗堡。及瑪林堡等地爲最甚。上西里亞工業區今已建成堅强之防塞，蘇軍進攻尤烈。</p>
<p>沃特河畔大戰方酣</p>
<p>蘇軍於要戰屢敗之後，今已獲突入卡托維茲·寳泉·及興登堡等地，其自格簡維茲出擊之部隊，則向南面與東南亦獲有進展，戰事漸漸迫近布萊斯勞，最近二十四小時內穌軍進攻該城東面與東北，並未獲逞。德軍現在科塞爾格羅加一帶作戰中，以阻止蘇軍在沃特河西岸建立橋頭堡。布籣頓堡與希尼台莫爾附近，戰事無新發展。波森·希尼台莫爾·托倫等要塞，防禦奏效。布朗堡守重現正在城之北部，與蘇軍巷戰中，穌軍在布朗堡迤西被向北面與西北推進，蘇軍在東普魯士續調到生力軍，進抵康尼斯堡。柯蘭方面戰事鬆弛。</p>
<p>德軍克復克拉貝茲</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國社訊，據本社駐東線記者稱：德軍於昨日向沃特河西烽蘇軍橋頭堡數處展開猛攻，毀其一大部份，而二度克復俄伯痕以南二十公里之克拉貝茲Krappitz。布曾·興登堡·哥尼格蕭特及卡托維滋北郊德軍之堅强據點，仍確保陣地，擊退敵軍攻勢，而同時予敵以重創。西里西亞煤礦區南部曾彼包圍之德軍數股已突圍而與其他德軍取獲聯絡。</p>
<h3>義奧拉鎭　毀於空襲</h3>
<p>居民三百喪生</p>
<p>米蘭二十九日中央社電　德國社訊：英美空軍最近製擊史貝齊亞省之奧拉鎭，蒙難者三百餘人，該鎭幾已完全被毀。</p>
<h3>德官方辦理　招尋失散人口</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：近因德國東部之戰事，致全國各地人民皆在尋覓其家族，失散之職昌則在探尋其工廠或公司之新地址，男子則在招尋其母妻子女。德國前已設立「疏散人之中央情報局」，現在爲彼等辦理此事，紀錄失散人之姓名·職業·年齡·原住地址，以便代爲招尋，藎疏散人及難民每抵一地，即須向當地警局呈報，故常能尋出失散人之下落。</p>
<h3>德與反軸心國交換傷兵平民</h3>
<p>沮里希二十九日中央社電　海通社訊，德國與反軸心傷兵，在日內瓦交換之一切手續，現已辦理就緒，可望於本月杪結束。至昨日爲止，共計有十三列車載德軍重傷戰俘，自馬賽開抵日內瓦，另有八列車反軸心傷兵，則經羅尼城開往馬賽。週杪另有專車一列，載德國被拘留之平民八百七十五人開抵日內瓦，按彼等前皆係被拘留在北美中美南美等地，最近始乘瑞典輪船渡大西洋而抵歐洲，彼等現暫居於洛桑附近，以待與同數之反軸心國平民亦換。</p>
<p>康斯坦士二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：邇來有運載德國或反動心國一重傷戰俘約三百名之火車多列，通過德國邊界康斯坦士或瑞士邊界之克勞資林根站，該兩站爲戰俘數干人新生活之開始地，此事實由國際紅十字會促成之。據康期坦士市長稱，重傷戰俘在康斯坦士交換，將繼績進行之。當第一次世界大戰時，通過康斯坦士之各國戰俘不下五十萬人，此項偉大之工作，現再度進行之，康斯坦士爲經過瑞士交換戰俘之量適宜地點，該地既不接近戰綫如巴塞爾然，又遠離軍事上之重要交通綫，德瑞兩國與國際機關間之合作，進行常極順利。據此間消息，重傷戰俘數萬人將經此舉行交換，醫院列車倚靠於德瑞交換車站上，看護人員担架戰俘，自此列車至彼列車，以便釋放回國。</p>
<h3>薩危兩國　邦交惡化</h3>
<p>葡京二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：薩爾瓦多臨時總統薩里那斯，下令無定期中止對危地馬拉之商務關係後，兩國關係驟形緊張，危地馬拉亦以停止對薩國之鐵路交通以爲報復。薩爾瓦多對美國輸出之咖啡，均須假道危地馬拉，去年十二月共轍出四萬包，今待運赴美者猶有一一八〇〇〇包，故其處境甚窘。</p>

<h3>三十四年度　各地農業增產要點</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　行政院農業增產策進委員會召開之各省市農業增產會議，業已圓滿閉幕，該會方面鑒於現時下農業增產使命重大，工作艱互，正宜把握時機，作更大努力，因此對於三十四年度工作之如何推進，除縝密制定策進計劃綱要，正在呈請政院，裁定公布中外，對於各地方在本年度如何推進工作一點，作詳切指示，並編成要點，茲誌全文如左；</p>
<p>（甲）關於農業增產團遭者：</p>
<p>（一）鄉鎭農業協進會之組成，鄉鎭農業協進會爲鄉鎭農業增產及復興農村經濟，組織互助社等之自動計劃實行機關，應以合作社訓練之中堅農民爲中心，於實施增產指定縣區內分別組織成立，上年度計已成立六百一十會，本年度不求數量之增加，仍求內容之充實，但本年新增之實施增產指定縣區內，仍預定增設一百會。茲爲推進協進會工作計，去年成立者，每會務一年補助四千元，本年新成立者，每會預定一年補助六千元。</p>
<p>（二）各地合作社原爲推進農業增產工作民間團體之中心，所有試作農場之設立，耕種技術之改善，及指導獎勵。種苗。肥料。耕牛。農具·農業機械等農業資材之配給，中堅農民之訓練，技術員之養成及訓練，協進會互助社之指導，暨其他有關農業增產事項，均有賴於合作社之積極的推動。因此對於合作社所必需之技術員養成所經濟，應於以補助，計每月每名預定補助七千元，惟總計以三百五十人爲限。（未完）</p>
<h3>美國內訌　民衆不滿情緒日見普遍</h3>
<p>今年正月四日日本內閣首次會議上，小磯演詞中曾有一句說：「敵美或許正在處心積慮地想，失之於歐洲戰綫者，而求得之於太平洋」。小磯首相這句話的意思，我認爲敵美當局爲維持國內的體面，以圖抑制人民的不滿，　想在太平洋戰場上更加努力，在這一點上，並不是「或許」。判斷敵美，的確大有這種企圖，是有充分理由的。</p>
<p>現在單就協約國主角美國而言，十二月中旬開始的德國大攻勢，曾給美國人民一個絕大的刺激。遠在攻勢前，美國人民早已對歐洲戰綫懷抱不安的態度。亞琛附近的戰鬥，由於德國熾烈的反抗，美軍曾消耗了三個多月的彈藥。結果，艾森霍華不得不訴怨似地說，如不得到新的補充，是不可能開始攻勢的。於是大總統選舉曾答應的一部軍需工塲改爲民需生產，無形宣告延期了。固然，這也是羅斯福欺騙人民的家常便飯，然而也不要忽略，這是出於不得已。人民充滿着極大的失望和絕端的不安。偏巧在這個期間內，倫台特攻勢便開始了。</p>
<p>美國大民對於軍部自詡勝利的言詞，非常的憤慨。去年底泰晤士報曾發表一文說：「赫爾西海軍上將曾於一九四三年新年獻辭上說，「今年將澈底擊潰軸心國家。」陸軍航空局長亞諾爾德上將，在問年二月時曾說：「我向諸位約定，在明年二月將會於柏林」。克拉克上將在同年十一月時曾說：「我堅決相信，一九四四年十一月前歐戰將告結束，我們取得最後勝利。」艾森霍華於十二月時說：「協約國將在一九四四年內取得歐戰勝利。」陸軍部次長巴達遜於一九四四年八月曾說：「對德戰爭取得澈底勝利，已經不是遙遙無期了。」此外還有總參謀長馬紹爾在十二月十七日的「陸軍與海軍」雜誌上，曾發表一文說：「我的文章尙未在雜誌上刊出以前，歐戰很有可能就宣告終了。」諸如此類的空頭安慰話，不勝枚舉。」</p>
<p>德國攻勢以迅雷不及掩耳的速度，在三星期不到的期間內，消滅了三分之一的西綫美國戰鬥力。捉襟露肘的美國檢查機構，愈想朦蔽事實，而反愈外洩眞相，誠可謂欲蓋彌彰。焦急的國民心境，千頭萬緒，一切都想加以過問，例如：三巨頭會議既在鄧巴頓奧克斯業已決定，爲何遲遲尙不舉行（羅斯福不得不保持緘默，以緩和最近人民的發言）？一般人所承認的反軸心國團結一致的象徵大西洋憲章，爲什麽無聲無臭被人置之一傍了？蒙高茂萊指揮下的英國軍隊，是否在袖手傍戰美軍的艱苦作戰（比利時戰綫上的一部英國軍隊，按同盟社電於一月四日才出現）？此外至於波開，希臘，重慶等諸如此類擾亂美國人民精神的問題，實不一而足。</p>
<p>羅斯福及其黨人，對於此等國內現象，實無法應付。他們焦急萬分，非常担心人民鬱積糾結的憤慨情緒，一旦爆發，不可收拾·因此爲緩和此種人民心理，便展開菲律賓的熾烈殊死戰。今日敵美固然不可一世，但一遭挫折，則國內即急轉直下。大東亞戰爭的歸宿，乃決定於現在的瞬間。（林譯目一月九日每日新聞社論）</p>

<p>陳彬龢辭</p>
<p>理事長陳彬龢氏致訊路謂：一今天中國新聞協會上海區分會歡遲宣傳部趙部長，孫交長，曁市府宣傳處劉處長，承蒙光臨，並承盟邦報這富局及中日文化界新聞界諸位先生參加，至爲感謂。</p>
<p>趙　長是新聞記者出身，經次長前任市府主任稿書，對處長　新聞協會理　，均屬夫好，不必詳細介紹。本人願羣此此歡遲　會，提出三屬意見，貢獻當局：　希望充實新聞　村與新聞遷材。新聞題材之改辦，希望張化中央　續精與提高覆員待遇。對於經費與人　兩方面，新　　底　　。其次新聞　村中　重　者　報紙，　　　　　　　，　平黑市。事變以前報紙每令價値三元，目下則高漲至四萬餘元，增中一萬五千倍，　爲爲人。</p>
<p>（二）改善新聞提羣員及文化　生活問題。近年物價高漲，從事宣傳工作的新聞界，文化界人士，生活異常報苦，希　部長設去遷步改善。關於新聞從望員重點配給，應包括金體新聞工作人員，深盼部長協助。傳早日實現。</p>
<p>（三）培養新聞人才，目前新聞人才，殊感不足，希望宣傳部設立培養新間人才售構，遲去上海新聞聯合會雖有青年記者訓練班之設，但規模狹小，力量薄弱，今後希望部方特別注意。</p>
<p>幾年以來，宣傳界的聚會，以此次爲嚴盛，足證新聞界文化界人士，對於新任三位長官表示熱望於擤護之誠，我們同人今後更應在推行國策，在宣傳行政指導之下，共同努力。」</p>
<p>趙部長辭</p>
<p>「今日承諸位招待，殊不最當，尤其本人服　於新聞界有年，座中均係新舊同業同志之士，更不取辱荷歡迎。本人此次出長宣部，原以才力不逮，未敢還承，乃中積以林臆部長出長皖政，本人又嘗濫竽新聞事業，因之未便固辭。本人曾有以新聞與宣傳　合運用之理想，假比機會，敢異諸一研討之。</p>
<p>新聞以忠實報道爲主。宣傳以啓發指導主，此固畫人皆知者，兩得其宜，則於報道之中，舅啓發之賣，此所謂　合運用也。便或以爲宣傳重在種梏。新聞則惟主報這。殊不知宣傳與新聞二者，均以全民爲對象，而非二者有所對立於其間。荀一切新聞盡受挃格，則與　何由健全？民意何由發德？此固非政府之初衷，亦決非新聞界之所顧接受。惟若新聞報道而不能善體國策，指示民衆，則其弊亦有不可勝言者。簡要言之。宣傳行政在協助新聞界，於國　之下，究成其使命，發　其事　，面新聞界亦當於國策之下，　報道宣傳之職賣。</p>
<p>我國新聞事業不過七八十年，發揚光大不達三十餘年，而政府之對新聞事業，向未甚加重視，或更爲法外之取歸，於是造成新聞界與政府不期然而成爲對立之現象，單閥政治封建政治之流毒，問屬無可譯言。逮民國十六年北代完以後，新聞界之地位，日以增高，新聞事業之業備，亦益　進步　因之政府對於新聞界亦日加重視，乃不幸在此蒸蒸日上之際，忽遭中日不幸之事變，以致十　之功，敗於一只，此實爲最足　惜之事。</p>
<p>國府運都。欲繼續已往之成績，而發揚光大之，特設宣傳部。林部長柏生本屬報人，出而長部，頗憶　昔日報公會開會之際，彼比探討業務之盛，明好談　之觀。林部長蒞任以後。開始部署迄於今日規模大備，本人不敏，繼任斯實，初不敢自忘其報人之資格，更當善繼林部長之前規，是以本日在此殊不敢爲新聞協會之招待宣傳部長，而自視當仍如　昔日報公會同人之聚餐盛會也。</p>
<p>本人旣乘此志，所願與諸君吿者：第一，在新聞事業方面，必以可能之力爲事業着想，爲報界協助，但在目前現寶狀况之下，更盼諸君益以戰時體制時，盡其節約之方法，辦理事業，俾可尅服難關，其尤要者，即全國新聞界本之團結，不限於一地一隅，蓋惟團結，始能發生力量，再進以行政慢構之配合，則爲力良且益大。第二，在言論紀戴方面，只須嚴守國　，當可儘量發表。本人樹於新聞之指導，固有責任，而指導之方決非特不主策瑣偏　，抑且必欲使人民之意見，多所發揚，政治實况，時有指示，庶政府可以由與論上獲得助力，爲之耳目，以補研究制度調查事實之不足，但亦希望所有紀戰，率以事實爲主，不宜歪曲，不宣煊染，俾以忠實之記載，爲設　之借鏡。</p>
<p>本人務報界，歷時較久，回業友好，遍於南北，而當時所爲間業同志吿者，亦即以上所舉之數點，事隔二十載，至今日朋與同業同志相周旋，實爲平生最所欣快之機會，故仍願以當日探討之言，爲諸君約略陳之，以諸君之努力，中國新聞事業前途之成功，自不待言也。」</p>

<h3>Mindanao Western Sea Area: Japanese Submarine Pursues and Attacks Enemy Ships; Four Enemy Ships Sunk in the Eastern Pacific</h3>
<p>Philippine Japanese Military Base, 29th, Central News Agency: On the 24th, a Japanese submarine squadron pursued and attacked an enemy transport convoy off Mindanao, sinking two enemy transport ships and one unidentified type of enemy warship, each struck by torpedoes. Furthermore, a certain Japanese submarine, commanded by Japanese Lieutenant Sada Tanaka, discovered an enemy transport convoy in the western sea area of Mindanao at dusk. Braving heavy enemy guard, the submarine daringly launched a surprise attack, firing several torpedoes, causing a violent explosion on one enemy transport ship. Following the successful surprise attack, the enemy convoy was thrown into great disarray. Amidst this chaos, a certain submarine commanded by Japanese Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa and another commanded by Japanese Lieutenant Matsuda seized the opportunity to boldly attack the enemy convoy. Lieutenant Commander Nakagawa bombed an enemy vessel, identified as a seaplane tender, while Lieutenant Matsuda's submarine bombarded an enemy transport ship, both enemy ships being hit and destroyed. In this engagement, all Japanese forces returned to base unscathed.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 29th, Central News Agency: Japanese submarines drove deep into the Eastern Pacific, disrupting the supply lines of the four bulwarks of the American mainland, sinking one American oil tanker and three transport ships.</p>
<h3>Luzon Island Battle Situation: Increasingly Fierce</h3>
<p>Philippine Frontline, 28th, Central News Agency: In the third week of the enemy American invasion of Luzon Island, the battle situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy has landed two additional divisions, bringing the total to seven divisions, including two tank divisions. With the cooperation of superior air power, they are attempting to advance. Approximately three enemy divisions are positioned along the northeastern highland line of Pangasinan, while the other two divisions are held in reserve. The two tank divisions, forming the main force, are forcibly breaking into the central plain of Luzon under the cover of air power. On the 26th, the enemy force, primarily tanks, numbering two hundred, reached the line around Clark Airfield, attempting to seize a portion of the airfield. The enemy's intention in breaking into Clark Airfield is to secure an air base for controlling Luzon Island, concentrating air force bases auxiliary to those in Leyte and Mindoro. However, the enemy's southward-moving troops have encountered fierce attacks from the Japanese army along the Clark Airfield line. With strong artillery positions, they have continuously bombarded enemy strongholds since the 26th, and with suicide attack squads and bayonet charges, they have thwarted the enemy's attempts. As of the 28th, the enemy had not completely captured Clark Airfield. Furthermore, small enemy units attempting to advance towards San Fernando were intercepted and stalled by Japanese forces in the southern highlands of Clark Airfield.</p>
<p>Philippine Ubi Base, 29th, Central News Agency: On the 25th, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force severely damaged an enemy battleship or large cruiser in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline Japanese Military More Base, 28th, Central News Agency: On the night of the 25th, Japanese air force units launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon Island, destroying one large transport ship and one destroyer.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Speculates on Japanese Military Strategy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: The landing enemy forces on Luzon Island, because the main Japanese forces have remained silent to this day, are finding it difficult to understand. A Washington reporter, observing the Japanese army's operational intentions, stated the following: The United States also knows that there has been no large-scale counteroffensive on Luzon Island, and therefore many are optimistic. However, if they were to learn that the Japanese headquarters is waiting for an opportunity to deploy a novel and ingenious defensive strategy, they would be extremely apprehensive. The Japanese army is currently appearing to lean towards decisive battles on the front lines. The Japanese army is waiting to move for the following two reasons: (1) The question of whether McArthur's forces will make new landings other than in Lingayen Gulf. If this is not clearly indicated, the Japanese army will not move its main forces. (2) In order to sweep across the American positions in one go, it is necessary to choose a favorable terrain for the decisive battle.</p>
<h3>Filipino Youth Join Assault Teams</h3>
<p>Lingayen Front, 29th, Central News Agency: Filipino youth, in order to defend their homeland, organized the Patriotic Comrades Association last autumn, making it their duty to destroy the British and Americans. Some of its members, unable to sit idly by and watch the enemy Americans invade their territory, bravely devoted themselves to the battlefield, joined the Japanese assault teams, and attacked enemy positions in Lingayen Gulf, achieving great results.</p>
<h3>Biha Aaboos Buried in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, Central News Agency: The funeral of Biha Aaboos, advisor to the Provisional Government of Free India, was solemnly held at Zojoji Temple here at 10:00 AM on the 29th, with Hirota Koki as the chairman of the funeral committee. Attendees included Minister of Munitions Yoshida, Ogasawara Nagasei, the Burmese Ambassador Thaiman, committee members of the Indian Independence League stationed in Japan, and many other old friends and acquaintances.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Assaults on the Burma Front; Finally Encircle British Forces in Lairam</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: According to Reuters on the 27th: The situation of the Japanese army's heroic attacks on the Irrawaddy front is as follows: The recent battle near Chauk-Minhla, a crossing point on the Irrawaddy River, is a good example of the Japanese army's spirit of attack. The British-Indian forces on the Burma front are now facing the fiercest attacks the Japanese army has ever launched, with Japanese forces carrying out continuous night-time close-quarters assaults. A certain British-American major, amidst the Japanese rain of bullets, explained the operational situation by the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese army, after continuous artillery fire from 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM, launched an even fiercer assault, finally encircling the British forces in Lairam, the situation being extremely urgent, and subsisting on biscuits.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing dispatch, Chiang Kai-shek's American Commander of the China Theater, Wedemeyer, and the American Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, broadcast on the 28th, formally naming the former Burma Road as the Stilwell Road.</p>
<p>Burmese Monks Cooperate with Japanese Forces</p>
<p>Rangoon, 29th, Central News Agency: The British-Indian-Chongqing forces, attempting to retake Burma, launched a counteroffensive last year and have invaded northern Burma. Recently, a monk escaped from enemy-occupied territory, conveying the atrocities committed by the British-Indian-Chongqing forces against the Burmese people, which greatly angered the Burmese government and people. This monk is the abbot of a certain temple in Nam Ma, northwest of Myitkyina. Having survived a near-death experience, he came to Rangoon and recounted the following: The enemy troops are of mixed races and have poor discipline. Countless Burmese civilians have been massacred by them. They frequently break into Burmese residents' homes, and if there are fewer people, the entire family is killed. If a family member goes out, it must be reported immediately, and a slight delay will result in the entire family being killed. All men over the age of sixteen and under the age of forty are conscripted into service. All women, regardless of race, are taken away. It is impossible to survive in enemy-occupied territory. Many temples in Myitkyina have been bombed and destroyed. No building in the city streets and villages is intact. All shops are occupied by the enemy. The young people in the nearby villages are frequently conscripted into service. If they dare to escape, the enemy will use various means to deal with them. We do not want to be used by them, so we are here, willing to cooperate with the Japanese army to the end.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Select Elite Troops for Assault on Peleliu; Inflict Heavy Damage on Enemy Airfield</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese Military Base in the Central Pacific, 29th, Central News Agency: Regarding the Japanese army's attacks against the enemy's airbase on Peleliu Island, which is being used as a base for air operations against the Philippines, the Japanese army had an attack force engage in close quarters combat against the enemy airfield in October. Recently, Lieutenant Hori Shigeo, after specially training an elite special attack force, landed near the enemy airfield on Peleliu Island and inflicted considerable damage after conducting a brave attack. Even the enemy forces openly admitted this, which shows the depth of the blow inflicted.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese Military Base in the Pacific, 28th, Central News Agency: The Japanese forces on Peleliu Island, with an indomitable fighting spirit, have been fighting bravely. At the end of last October, a special attack force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Endo, responding from Palau Island, broke into Peleliu Island, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. Also, on the 17th of this month, a special attack force of several dozen men led by Lieutenant Hori Shigeo launched an attack from Palau Island, broke into the vicinity of the enemy airfield on Peleliu Island, and inflicted considerable damage. This special attack force was comprised of several dozen warriors chosen and trained by Lieutenant Colonel Endo.</p>
<h3>The Impregnable Burma Front</h3>
<p>The United States, eager to invade the Philippines, is attempting to make the Chinese mainland a land base for attacks against Japan, and is working on two fronts: advancing operations from the sea towards the coast of the Chinese mainland, and transporting troops and supplies from the Ledo Road. As enemy General Wedemeyer said: "Island hopping cannot threaten Japan; China must be used as a base. The counteroffensive in Burma is a response to the Pacific operations. The war in China is America's own war." The enemy's counteroffensive operation in Burma is a part of the long Pacific and European operations. As the battle situation on these fronts intensifies, the Burma front naturally shows a tense situation. Since the rainy season last year, the Japanese army in Burma has already prepared its strategic posture to welcome the New Year of 1945 with an ironclad formation.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Takes the Initiative</p>
<p>In the northern Burma area, in late October of last year, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, with the main force of the 11th Army Group, attempted to retake Longling and Mangshi, and began a general counteroffensive. The Japanese army immediately launched appropriate counterattacks to consume their combat power, gradually reducing their front and luring them into the trench warfare of Wanting and Namhkam. The Japanese garrison fought hard in the salient position of Bhamo for a month, precisely because it could intercept the American-Chongqing forces in Bhamo at the established positions of Wanting and Namhkam. Thanks to the fierce fighting of these advance units, the Japanese army was able to deploy properly on both sides of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Along the Myitkyina railway line and near Imphal, solid front deployments were completed during the Japanese army's hard fighting. On the Nanchi front, when the Japanese army first used a detachment to contain the enemy forces along the Kaladan River and near the Arakan Mountains, it prepared a decisive battle posture. In short, the progress of the operations was entirely under the initiative of the Japanese army. On the front of the Japanese army's positions in Wanting and Namhkam, there were approximately six divisions of the 11th Army Group, one division of the 20th Army Group, and one division of the American-Chongqing forces, plus one division on the Mongmit front, totaling approximately nine divisions. In order to completely open the Ledo Road, they have begun a full-scale offensive, but the Japanese army is also increasing its forces and strongly repelling them.</p>
<p>Enemy Strength</p>
<p>The enemy forces north of the Moreh River are deploying four divisions in the first quadrant, attempting to invade the Shwebo Plain. The Japanese army, with the help of the air force, launched appropriate counterattacks, inflicting heavy losses. As for the coastal area, the enemy forces began to land carefully only after the Japanese army automatically reorganized the front. However, they are boasting loudly on the radio.</p>
<p>The battle situation in various places is very active, with tanks and air force cooperating to launch active offensives. Recently, enemy aircraft have been cooperating with ground troops to carry out bombing and strafing, dropping incendiary bombs in an attempt to burn down the Japanese army's positions, and frequently reconnoitering supply points and supply lines, adding to the strafing and bombing.</p>
<p>The enemy strength gathered on the border between China, India, and Burma is approximately 640,000. In addition, there are five divisions of the ground forces and one division of the marines in the amphibious operation, and five divisions of paratroopers, totaling 210,000. It is said that the army in India commanded by Auchinleck has reached 970,000. The enemy, with such a large force, intends to invade the coastal areas of Burma. In modern amphibious operations, airborne operations must be launched first, or carried out simultaneously. The situation on the Burma front is also the same. First, paratroopers are used to create bridgeheads, and then airborne troops are brought in.</p>
<p>Seizing the Initiative</p>
<p>As for the naval power that is the driving force behind the amphibious operation, it is the British Eastern Fleet, which is a mixed formation of the armies of Britain, France, Holland, and Italy. With the Japanese army's well-organized deployment already completed today, it will never easily allow the enemy to realize its intentions. In fact, the enemy's fighting is very cautious. For example, in the Nanchi area, after the Japanese garrison automatically withdrew, the enemy did not dare to advance hastily. From the beginning of the heavy bombing by aircraft and shelling by warships to the landing of British troops, it took as long as 24 days, and they cautiously attacked from all directions from a location 20 kilometers north of the Japanese base.</p>
<p>In their new operations, the enemy will thoroughly mobilize air power. They only dare to act when they make full use of air power and have sufficient ammunition and other resources to rely on. The Japanese army's tactic against this kind of warfare is to seize the initiative. That is, to defeat the enemy's initial actions before their operational preparations are completed and they are about to carry out a counteroffensive, and to crush their counteroffensive attempts. If the enemy wants to regroup and launch another counteroffensive, it will inevitably take a considerable amount of time, and the Japanese army will seize the initiative again when they plan to launch another counteroffensive, and give them a head-on blow. In the Myitkyina area, the Japanese army has blocked the superior enemy forces outside the key points of northern Burma for as long as a month.</p>
<p>Waiting for an Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy</p>
<p>Because of the timely strategic deployment on the main roads, the Japanese army's supply and communication between the front and rear are worry-free. On the contrary, the enemy's supply lines are long and stretched, with many weaknesses. From their operational bases Myitkyina, Imphal, and Chittagong to their front lines, they stretch for 300 kilometers, and in between there are the dangerous mountains, dense forests, rivers, and swamps of the India-Burma border. Moreover, their main supply routes all originate from the operational bases, and there is only one route, especially in the Nanchi area, whether it is transportation or advancing troops, they must cross the Mayu mountain range, the Arakan mountain range, and countless small streams of the Mayu River from India.</p>
<p>Today, the enemy's actions are quite frequent on the front lines throughout Burma. The mountain warfare that was previously waged on the India-Burma border, once it enters the plains, will become a three-dimensional mobile war in which mechanized units take center stage, and the battle situation will become increasingly fierce. But this is all within the scope of operations that the Japanese army anticipated and discussed last September. The Japanese army in Burma is using new tactics, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the arrogant enemy.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Discussion on Improving the Salaries of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Recently, the government authorities are practicing purging corruption in order to establish a clean government; and improving the treatment of civil servants in order to stabilize their lives. "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know honor and disgrace." Eating and wearing warmth are the premise of a clean government.</p>
<p>The new municipal administrator of this city, in order to eradicate chronic ills, has also recently considered improving the treatment of his subordinate officials, police, etc., and is actively calculating in order to achieve its realization in the shortest possible time. Improving the treatment of civil servants is generally not a problem; the question now is how to improve it.</p>
<p>The most basic principle is to provide civil servants with the necessities of life or their equivalents. There are three methods: (1) Pay salaries entirely in kind; (2) Pay for major necessities in kind, and then pay a certain amount of salary; (3) Pay for all living needs entirely in cash.</p>
<p>The first method is to calculate the amount of various necessities required by each employee each month, and distribute them separately, or convert the various necessities into cash first, and then distribute one or two or three kinds of necessities that are easier to distribute according to the converted amount of cash. For example, various necessities can be converted into a certain amount of cash, and a certain amount of cash can buy several dou of rice and several jin of flour, etc., and then several dou of rice or several jin of flour are distributed each month.</p>
<p>The second method is to distribute in kind a portion of particularly important necessities, such as rice, flour, coal briquettes, oil, etc., and then pay the rest in cash. For example, several dou of rice, several jin of flour, several dan of coal briquettes, several jin of oil, and a certain amount of cash are distributed each month.</p>
<p>The third method is not to distribute any goods, but to pay for all the necessary goods in cash according to their prices. However, if there are no ration coupons or no designated rationed goods that have been properly negotiated for purchase, the conversion standard should not be calculated using designated ration prices or price limits, but should be fairly priced according to general market prices. The price on the first or fifteenth day of each month should be used as the standard, such as in accordance with the price index officially adjusted by the official agency.</p>
<p>The above three methods can be used flexibly at any time. When goods are available, goods are distributed; when goods are difficult to collect, cash is paid. In short, the principle is to be able to obtain the necessary living goods. However, it seems more feasible to pay both goods and cash together. Therefore, it is best to adopt the second method and then use it flexibly. For example, several dou of rice and flour, etc. (or ration coupons), and a certain amount of cash can be issued each month, and it can still be adjusted according to the difficulty of purchasing goods.</p>
<p>As for the standard for issuing necessities, we believe that it is more reasonable to calculate according to a family of four to six people. For example, if we take a family of four with a husband, wife, and two children as the standard, and estimate according to general life, the monthly needs of a family of four are: five dou of rice (equivalent to the current market price of 20,000 yuan, ration price of 3,250 yuan)</p>
<p>Half a bag of flour (equivalent to the market price of 6,000 yuan, ration price of 3,600 yuan)</p>
<p>Three dan of firewood (equivalent to the market price of 15,000 yuan; coal briquettes are not easy to buy, and fuel is generally calculated as firewood)</p>
<p>Dishes and cooking supplies (24,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Rent, water, electricity, and donations (1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap (2,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Other expenses (about 10,000 yuan)</p>
<p>If the above rice and flour, etc., are calculated according to market prices, the total monthly living expenses are about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. If the rice and flour, etc., are calculated according to ration prices, they also require more than 60,000 yuan. Even if life is tightened up a bit, or some miscellaneous grains are eaten, the minimum monthly expense for an ordinary family of four cannot be less than 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. If there are more children or parents, siblings, etc. in the family, at least one-fifth more must be added for each additional person. A family of five or six people needs at least about 80,000 yuan in living expenses.</p>
<p>The treatment of the civil servants under the jurisdiction of governments at all levels, in any case, cannot be too far from the above standards. Also, the above is calculated according to current market prices, and the treatment must naturally be adjusted at any time as prices change, and it is more reasonable to settle accounts according to the cost of living index for each month.</p>
<p>Regarding the differentiated treatment of civil servants due to the level of their positions, we believe that the minimum living expenses should be kept uniform as much as possible, and higher-level employees can be paid additional salaries and office expenses. The living and social expenses of senior officials are indeed greater than those of junior officials.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more point to be raised: for those who live alone locally or have fewer than four family members, we believe that it is not appropriate to particularly reduce their treatment. Single or smaller families have direct and indirect burdens, and the actual burden will not be less. Some have some family members in the countryside, and some unmarried people still have to support their parents, younger siblings, etc. living in their hometowns. At a time when there is a plan to disperse the population, officials with family members in the countryside should not be discriminated against. In reality, the costs of rent, water, and electricity, etc., for those with fewer family members will not be reduced much, and the average food expenses per person will be more expensive than those with more family members. Therefore, while it is certainly appropriate to increase the subsidies for those with more family members, it is unreasonable to deduct the necessities of life for those with fewer family members.</p>
<h3>Army Vice Minister Shibayama Issues Remarks to the Nation</h3>
<p>Implementing Donations of Money and Goods for Critical Uses</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Army Vice Minister Shibayama, during the Fourth Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 29th, expressed his gratitude to the nation for their enthusiastic donations of money and goods, stating: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, up to December of last year, the number of cash donations reached 1,389,000, totaling 777,700,000 yen. Material donations amounted to 377,000 items. The cumulative total since the Sino-Japanese War includes 734,000 cash donations, 1,626,000 consolation money contributions, and 80,000 academic incentive grants. In terms of monetary value, national defense donations totaled 777,197,000 yen, consolation money 143,720,000 yen, and school technology incentive grants 15,480,000 yen, totaling 936,180,000 yen. These donations of money and goods are the culmination of the sincere hearts of the people, many of whom are special attack unit soldiers and frontline troops, for which we are particularly grateful. Regarding the use of national defense donations, in accordance with the wishes of the donors, they are used to procure the most critical weaponry and other national defense materials. As of the end of December last year, this has primarily been used to procure 5,982 aircraft, 279 tanks and armored vehicles, 2,075 cannons of various types, 2,151 machine guns of various types, 255 listening devices, 150 searchlights, 758 engines, and other various military vehicles, aviation equipment, communication equipment, etc. National defense donations also include metal military swords, military woolen cloth, military pigeons, and military dogs. These military supplies procured with national defense donations are all supplied to frontline and homeland defense units, directly contributing greatly to combat operations. Therefore, special consideration has been given to these donations of money and goods, and the sincerity of the donors will be respected forever. Consumable weapons such as aircraft will be replaced at national expense with newly manufactured items bearing the same name, to express gratitude to the donors. Consolation money will be used to purchase consolation goods and comfort facilities for deployed units.</p>
<h3>Strong Anti-American Sentiment Among the People of Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces - Statement by Director of Information Matsudaira</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a routine press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Director Matsudaira. He discussed the anti-American sentiments among the inland populace and the issue of the Nationalists and Communists. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drunkenness and Misconduct Corrupt Public Morals</p>
<p>According to recent arrivals from the interior, there are approximately 1,500 American troops stationed in the Chongqing area, mostly air force personnel, and about 500 in Kunming. In November of last year, public reception centers were established in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming to accommodate these American troops. These centers provide daily meals and drinks, as well as female attendants and singers. Dance parties are held every Tuesday and Friday evening to provide entertainment. However, many American soldiers do not understand the situation in China. Despite receiving such preferential treatment, they still discriminate against the Chinese and often engage in unlawful behavior. They often drive through the city, abducting young women and driving off with them for their amusement, and engage in drunken disturbances frequently. In Kunming alone, in the middle of November last year, there were as many as fourteen disputes between American troops and local residents, nine of which involved women, and the rest involved drunkenness. The corruption of public morals is readily apparent.</p>
<p>Cause of Fire at the American Embassy</p>
<p>After reporting the news, Director Matsudaira continued with his personal thoughts, stating: Foreign news agencies reported that the American Embassy in Chongqing caught fire on the 19th of this month, and the next day the US military headquarters and oil depot also caught fire. According to reports, the fires spread rapidly due to insufficient water pressure. However, in my opinion, the situation may not be that simple. Insufficient water pressure may be a factor, but the fact that the fires broke out repeatedly suggests that the cause was not accidental. It is possible that the fires were deliberately set by the populace due to excessive anti-American sentiment.</p>
<p>The Nationalist-Communist Issue is Not Easily Resolved</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the Nationalist-Communist issue, the Director briefly stated that when Zhou Enlai recently arrived in Chongqing, he made a statement to the press, outlining four points that Mao Zedong hoped for from the Chongqing government: (1) The Chongqing side should promptly convene a National Assembly and implement constitutional governance. (2) Abolish the dictatorship and establish a democratic government. (3) Unify military affairs. (4) Recognize that all parties and factions have equal rights and status. It is currently unknown whether the Nationalist Party will accept these proposals, but it is rumored that Chiang Kai-shek intends to resolve everything through political means.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Yarn and Fabric Merchants Donate to the Thai Government</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Forty Japanese cotton yarn and fabric merchants in Thailand, to express their gratitude for the protection and support of the Thai government, have donated one million Thai baht to the Thai government to help improve the welfare of the Thai people. The donation ceremony was held at 4:00 PM on the 24th at the Thai Prime Minister's residence. Many influential figures from both the Japanese and Thai governments and the public attended.

<h3>Japan's Rice and Wheat Harvest for Last Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Mr. Yugawa, Director of the Food Administration Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, stated on the 29th at the Fifth Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, in response to a question from Mr. Hamaji Bumpei regarding the amount of rice and wheat harvested last year: We are currently investigating the actual amount of rice and wheat harvested last year, so the precise statistical figures are not yet available. The wheat harvest is approximately 24.5 million, and the rice harvest is approximately 60 million to 62 million, as previously announced. Based on the latest information, it may be slightly higher.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Appointed as Committee Member for Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Province Holds Security Conference</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Recently, in various counties of this province, unscrupulous armed groups have frequently set up checkpoints on land and water transportation routes to collect fees, thereby affecting transportation, raising prices, and disrupting local security. The provincial government convened a security conference the day before yesterday, gathering administrative supervisors of various districts and district chiefs and police chiefs of various counties to discuss measures to ensure security and thoroughly prohibit the establishment of checkpoints and the collection of fees. These measures will be promptly and rigorously implemented, and an announcement has been jointly issued by the provincial government and the Pacification Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Revised Fee Schedule for Exit Permits</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously charged 20 national currency for the paper cost of exit permits to Japan and Manchukuo.

To alleviate this, approval has been granted to charge 200 national currency per permit, effective February 1st of this year.</p>
<h3>Food Panic in French Territory</h3>

<h3>Exemption of Rice Levy System for People in Jiangning and Other Counties – Decision of the Capital Price Stabilization Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The plan for stabilizing the prices of essential goods in the capital city area has been drafted by relevant authorities and submitted to and approved by the high authorities. The plan includes exempting the rice levy system for people in Jiangning, Piaoshui, and Jurong counties. The content stipulates that two dou of public rice should be handed over per mu, equivalent to five dou of paddy rice, to be purchased at the public price of 3,700 yuan per shi. Therefore, the rice consumed by Japanese residents and factories will be allocated by the Nanjing Special Municipality in conjunction with the Nanjing Office of the Rice Administration Committee. It is reported that the Jiangning County Government previously negotiated with the Rice Administration Committee Office to contract for 150,000 shi of rice. The Jiangning County Government has also urged various districts to actively carry out the rice levy. It is understood that the results so far have been quite impressive. However, as of now, the Jiangning County Government has only signed a contract with the Rice Administration Committee Office for 10,000 shi of rice, with over 6,000 shi already delivered to the warehouse. The remaining amount is still being paid. As for the remaining 140,000 shi of rice levy, it is currently unknown how much the Jiangning authorities have collected and whether a contract will be signed in the future to pay off the full amount. Regarding this issue, the Nanjing Office of the Rice Administration Committee intends to ask the relevant authorities to investigate the actual amount collected by the district offices in the county and make reasonable arrangements.</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Clarifies New Policy Toward China - Making Every Effort to Enhance Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu, stated on the afternoon of the 28th at the First Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives in response to a question from Mr. Tanaka Ko, that the key to resolving the Greater East Asia War lies in Sino-Japanese cooperation, and that Japan's new policy toward China is continuing to advance along this line. The Q&amp;A is as follows:</p>
<p>(Mr. Tanaka asked) The purpose of this war is to make the Chinese people aware that their position should be based on the Greater East Asia and to cooperate in the construction of the Greater East Asia. For this purpose, Japan must have a full understanding of the Chinese people's minds and promote countermeasures and policies. I would like to ask the government about its measures in this regard.</p>
<p>(Mr. Shigemitsu answered) The Greater East Asia War originated from the China issue and will also end with the China issue, as I have said before. The resolution of this war depends solely on Sino-Japanese cooperation, and Japan's new policy toward China is advancing along this line. The government intends to continue to make every effort to enhance Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>(Mr. Tanaka asked) Gaining the hearts of the Chinese people depends on the quality of politics in the peaceful areas. Therefore, it is not only necessary to strengthen cooperation with the National Government, but also to make efforts to directly grasp the hearts of the people. War and economic control are unavoidable, but I believe that special consideration and discretion should be given to the control in China. What are your views?</p>
<p>(Mr. Shigemitsu answered) It is of course impossible to think of economic control in the same way as in Japan. For civil administration in China, it is appropriate to take measures that suit the Chinese people. However, since a large number of Japanese troops are currently stationed there, some degree of economic control is unavoidable.</p>
<p>(Mr. Tanaka asked) I believe it is unreasonable to expect the same things from the Chinese as from the Japanese. What are your views?</p>
<p>(Mr. Shigemitsu answered) China has its own position, and the Chinese people have their own ideas. For us, it is necessary to fully understand and respect the position of the Chinese people and promote policies. We must never have the idea of the Japanese and take actions that are forced and incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Minister Horiuchi and Others Leave Japan to Return to Their Posts - New Economic Policy to Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) With regard to the fact that Japan, an allied nation, in order to assist our country in establishing a wartime economic system, vigorously exert the total power of the decisive battle, is giving further cooperation in accordance with the spirit of the alliance treaty and the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, there were discussions on implementing a new economic policy toward China at the 86th session of the Japanese parliament. The news spread, and our country's government and public alike were unanimous in their eagerness and deep expectation. The local authorities of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Embassy in China are now actively drafting plans. It is reported that Minister Horiuchi of the Embassy and Counselor Okazaki of the Shanghai Office jointly went to Japan a week ago to hold specific consultations with the heads of the Japanese government on this matter. Now, both have returned to Shanghai on the 28th, and a preliminary decision has been made regarding the plan. They are currently holding final consultations with the local military and political authorities and the National Government authorities, and it is scheduled to be officially announced and implemented in the near future. It is expected that an economic institution will be established in the future to exert the functions of a high-level economic general staff headquarters. Therefore, it is predicted that the implementation of the new policy will make great contributions to enhancing our country's participation in the war, as well as stabilizing the people's livelihood in the rear.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Japan's War Aims - Building a World of Freedom and Equality</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, at the First Subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 28th, answered questions from Mr. Kayama and clarified the inconsistency between Japan's just war aims and the war aims of the anti-Axis countries. The purpose of their war, which was fully exposed at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, is only to thoroughly defeat Japan and Germany, but our war aims are to build a world of freedom and equality. The basis of the Greater East Asia Declaration is also at this point.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu, stated on the afternoon of the 28th at the First Subcommittee Committee of the House of Representatives, in response to a question from Mr. Shoten Goen Koji regarding the Empire's Islamic policy: The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is the construction of the Greater East Asia and the liberation of the nations. Most of the Muslims in the Greater East Asia are also oppressed nations, and Japan will naturally spare no effort to fully cooperate in the liberation of Muslims. Recently, the Turkish government announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, but as the Turkish Foreign Minister argued to me, it was due to the coercive demands of Britain and the United States, and not the original intention of the Turkish government. Therefore, these measures do not represent the will of Muslims, and there is no need to elaborate further. Japan's policy toward Muslims is extremely clear in Japan's allowing the independence of the Indonesian nation. Japan will always guide Muslims in the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration to a policy of firm strikes, friendship, cooperation, mutual respect, and assistance.</p>
<h3>Central Government Agencies to Replace Identification Cards</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The identification cards for staff members of various central government agencies for this year have been uniformly issued by the National Government Military Affairs Department. The official certificates used by senior and junior officials are dark brown, those for probationary officials are orange-yellow, and those for staff members, public servants, and workers are teal. All previously issued old cards are invalid. If any retired staff members are found to be still using old cards, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>The European Situation and the Clash of the Three Powers</h3>
<p>The pace of the European policy of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, has gradually begun to be disrupted; of course, this is not an accident, but something that was expected. The reason why the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were previously able to coordinate on Europe was because they had common ground on two points: destroying the new European order established by Germany and opposing the fascist regime. After destroying the German new order, when it comes to the question of what concepts and ideas to use to build Europe, the three countries cannot but fall into great contradictions. Their coordination can be said to be "relatively possible, but absolutely impossible." The process of destroying the German new order is the stage of relative coordination, and the so-called designing and building Europe is the stage of entering absolute opposition.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Germany withdrew its troops to its homeland in accordance with strategic requirements. The three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, who closely followed, showed political restraint everywhere in the "liberated European territory" due to the different national characteristics of each other. The United States's ambition for Europe is to use Europe as one wing of its gold standard world domination. This can already be seen in the after-war security mechanism designed by the United States. Of course, the United States is loudly advocating non-interference in European countries, but its true intention is to use this to restrain Britain and the Soviet Union's in-depth involvement in Europe, in order to make Europe accept its political influence and complete its ambition to dominate Europe. Britain has always adhered to its old trick of dividing spheres of influence in order to maintain the important parts of Europe, thereby salvaging the decline of the British Empire. As for the Soviet Union, as it designed in the after-war security mechanism, it believes that the British method of dividing Europe into various spheres of influence is unreasonable, and always recognizes Europe as an indivisible whole, but in this attitude, we can see the Soviet Union's independent and far-sighted vision for European policy. The recent Soviet-French alliance is also opposing Britain's conservative attitude. The Soviet Union has also repeatedly stated the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of European countries, but with the condition of eliminating fascist regimes, which is an attempt to establish pro-Soviet regimes within each country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is the so-called "liberated" European countries that are under the clash of the European policies of these three countries. From Britain and the United States, European countries get no bread, only verbal "freedom", in addition to hunger and cold, they also suffer political chaos. Italy, which accepted the plots of Britain and the United States and had Badoglio betray, is in a state of hunger throughout the country. Greece and Belgium are in a state of anarchy due to the harassment of armed guerrillas. So what is worth noting is that a strong red force is gradually emerging throughout Europe. All phenomena such as chaos, poverty, and hunger are the best places to create red forces. This proves that Soviet forces or pro-Soviet elements are growing day by day everywhere in Europe. What Britain and the United States, especially Britain, are deeply pained and worried about is this trend. Britain, which has long regarded Greece as its sphere of influence, according to common sense, is suffering both internal and external consequences. Britain recognized the Curzon Line for the division of Poland, tore up the Atlantic Charter itself, and only cared about showing flattery to the Soviet Union in order to seek Soviet help, which only exposed Britain's lack of integrity and incompetence to the world.</p>
<p>But the facts are not as the Allies thought. Germany, which has been enduring and being cautious for a long time, taking advantage of the contradictions between them, has gathered the total power of the country and launched an offensive. They will soon destroy this fantasy of trying to decide the fate of Europe without regard to Germany, the central force of Europe. (Translated by Lin from the Asahi Shimbun on December 25)</p>
<h3>German Reinforcements Gather on the Eastern Front: Preparing for a Major Counteroffensive; Breslau Becomes a Strong Fortress</h3>
<p>Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – A German news agency reports that German Chief of Staff General Mudra recently issued a declaration to German forces on the Eastern Front, stating: "Do not be misled by the loss of territory on the Eastern Front. The German High Command is currently implementing a clear plan and is capable of controlling the entire army. No German units or divisions have been captured. German forces are currently withdrawing westward from the middle reaches of the Vistula River, and their vanguard units have reached previously prepared new positions. At the same time, reinforcements have departed from various locations. Once the German forces are fully assembled, they will engage the enemy. The German High Command will determine the date of the counteroffensive."</p>
<p>Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – A German news agency reports that a local afternoon newspaper commented on the war situation, stating: "Millions of German soldiers and a large number of supply units are heading to the Eastern Front. It will take time to contain the Soviet offensive. Temporary measures can avert immediate danger, but we do not need them. Superficial developments may alarm the inexperienced, but the German High Command is maintaining the secrecy of its countermeasures as much as possible."</p>
<p>Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that Soviet forces are launching a fierce attack from the southeast via Briglau and have reached the outskirts of Breslau. German forces and people's defense units are fighting hard to defend the city. Obstacles have been placed on the main roads, and the number of tank traps is increasing daily. Breslau is gradually transforming into a fortress, with people of all ages serving as guards. The city has abundant food supplies, and efforts are being made to protect the water supply. A major battle is expected in the coming days.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that German units engaged in mobile warfare behind Soviet lines are effectively containing the Soviet forces. This does not mean that the previous major battles have subsided. On the contrary, fierce fighting is taking place at all key points reached by the Soviet vanguard, especially in the Upper Silesia industrial area, east and southeast of Königsberg, Breslau, Pitschen, Schneidemühl, Toruń, Bromberg, and Marienburg. The Upper Silesia industrial area has been fortified, and the Soviet offensive is particularly intense.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Rages on the Banks of the Warta River</p>
<p>After repeated defeats in key battles, Soviet forces have broken through into areas such as Katowice, Posen, and Hindenburg. Units attacking from Gleiwitz have also made progress to the south and southeast. The fighting is gradually approaching Breslau. In the past 24 hours, Soviet attacks on the east and northeast of the city have been unsuccessful. German forces are currently fighting in the Cosel-Glogau area to prevent the Soviets from establishing a bridgehead on the west bank of the Warta River. There are no new developments in the vicinity of Brandenburg and Schneidemühl. The defenses of fortresses such as Posen, Schneidemühl, and Toruń are effective. The Bromberg garrison is currently engaged in street fighting with Soviet forces in the northern part of the city. Soviet forces west of Bromberg are being pushed north and northwest. The Soviets continue to deploy fresh troops in East Prussia and are advancing towards Königsberg. The fighting in the Courland area has eased.</p>
<p>German Forces Recapture Krappitz</p>
<p>Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – A German news agency reports that, according to its correspondent on the Eastern Front, German forces launched a fierce attack yesterday on several Soviet bridgeheads west of the Warta River, destroying a large portion of them and recapturing Krappitz, 20 kilometers south of Ober Glogau, for the second time. Strong German positions in Butzen, Hindenburg, Königshütte, and the northern suburbs of Katowice remain secure, repelling enemy offensives and inflicting heavy casualties. Several German units previously surrounded in the southern Silesian coal mining area have broken through and made contact with other German forces.</p>
<h3>The Town of Aiola Destroyed in an Air Raid</h3>
<p>Three Hundred Residents Killed</p>

<h3>German Government Organizes Search for Missing Persons</h3>
<p>Berlin, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that due to the recent fighting in eastern Germany, people across the country are searching for their families, displaced employees are looking for the new addresses of their factories or companies, and men are searching for their mothers, wives, and children. Germany has already established a "Central Information Bureau for Evacuees" and is now handling this matter for them, recording the names, occupations, ages, and original addresses of missing persons in order to help find them. Evacuees and refugees are required to report to the local police station upon arrival in a new location, which often helps locate missing persons.</p>
<h3>Germany and Anti-Axis Powers Exchange Wounded Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>Zurich, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that all procedures for the exchange of wounded German and Anti-Axis soldiers in Geneva have been finalized and are expected to be completed by the end of this month. As of yesterday, a total of thirteen trains carrying severely wounded German prisoners of war had arrived in Geneva from Marseille, while another eight trains carrying wounded Anti-Axis soldiers had traveled to Marseille via Lorney. At the end of the week, another train carrying 875 German civilians detained in North America, Central America, and South America arrived in Geneva. They recently crossed the Atlantic Ocean aboard Swedish ships to reach Europe and are now temporarily residing near Lausanne, awaiting exchange for an equal number of Anti-Axis civilians.</p>
<p>Constance, December 29th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Huitong News Agency reports that recently, several trains carrying approximately 300 severely wounded prisoners of war from Germany or the Anti-Axis powers have passed through Constance on the German border or Kreuzlingen station on the Swiss border. These two stations mark the beginning of a new life for thousands of prisoners of war. This fact has been facilitated by the International Red Cross. According to the Mayor of Constance, the exchange of severely wounded prisoners of war in Constance will continue. During World War I, no fewer than 500,000 prisoners of war from various countries passed through Constance. This great work is now being carried out again. Constance is a suitable location for the exchange of prisoners of war via Switzerland, as it is neither close to the front lines like Basel nor far from important military transportation routes. Cooperation between Germany, Switzerland, and international organizations is progressing smoothly. According to local sources, tens of thousands of severely wounded prisoners of war will be exchanged here. Hospital trains rely on German and Swiss exchange stations, and nurses carry prisoners of war on stretchers from one train to another for release and repatriation.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Increased Agricultural Production in Various Regions in the 34th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945]</h3>
<p>Nanjing, December 28th, Central News Agency Telegraph – The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan has concluded its meeting on agricultural production in various provinces and cities. The committee believes that the current mission of increasing agricultural production is of great importance and the work is arduous, and that it is appropriate to seize the opportunity and make greater efforts. Therefore, regarding how to promote work in the 34th year, in addition to carefully formulating an outline of a promotion plan, which is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for adjudication and promulgation, detailed instructions were given on how to promote work in various localities this year, and they were compiled into key points. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding agricultural production promotion groups:</p>
<p>(1) The establishment of township agricultural promotion associations. Township agricultural promotion associations are automatic planning and implementation agencies for promoting township agricultural production and revitalizing the rural economy, organizing mutual aid societies, etc. They should be organized and established separately within the designated county areas for implementing increased production, with core farmers trained in cooperatives as the center. A total of 610 associations have been established in the past year. This year, instead of seeking an increase in quantity, the focus will be on enriching the content. However, within the newly designated county areas for implementing increased production this year, it is still planned to add 100 associations. In order to promote the work of the promotion associations, those established last year will be subsidized 4,000 yuan per association per year, and those newly established this year are expected to be subsidized 6,000 yuan per association per year.</p>
<p>(2) Local cooperatives have always been the center of private organizations promoting agricultural production. The establishment of experimental farms, the improvement of farming techniques, and guidance and encouragement. The allocation of agricultural materials such as seeds, fertilizers, draft cattle, agricultural implements, and agricultural machinery, the training of core farmers, the training of technicians, the guidance of promotion associations and mutual aid societies, and other matters related to agricultural production all rely on the active promotion of cooperatives. Therefore, economic assistance should be provided for the training of technicians necessary for cooperatives, with an estimated subsidy of 7,000 yuan per person per month, but the total is limited to 350 people. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in the United States: Public Dissatisfaction Becomes Increasingly Widespread</h3>
<p>In his speech at the first cabinet meeting of the Japanese government on January 4th of this year, Koiso said, "The enemy America may be plotting to make up in the Pacific for what they lose on the European front." I believe that what Prime Minister Koiso meant by this was that the enemy American authorities, in order to maintain their domestic image and suppress public dissatisfaction, intended to work harder in the Pacific theater. In this regard, it is not "perhaps." There is ample reason to judge that the enemy America definitely has this intention.</p>
<p>Now, taking the leading Allied power, the United States, alone, the German offensive that began in mid-December gave the American people a tremendous shock. Long before the offensive, the American people had already harbored an uneasy attitude towards the European front. The battle near Aachen, due to fierce German resistance, consumed more than three months of American ammunition. As a result, Eisenhower had to complain, as if aggrieved, that it would be impossible to begin an offensive without new supplies. Thus, the conversion of some military-industrial plants to civilian production, which had been promised during the presidential election, was indefinitely postponed. Of course, this is also a common trick of Roosevelt to deceive the people, but it should not be overlooked that this was out of necessity. The people were filled with great disappointment and extreme unease. Coincidentally, the Rundstedt Offensive began during this period.</p>
<p>The American people were very angry at the military's self-proclaimed victorious pronouncements. The Times published an article at the end of last year saying, "Admiral Halsey said in his New Year's message in 1943, 'This year, we will completely crush the Axis powers.' General Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Forces, said in February of the same year, 'I promise you that we will be in Berlin next February.' General Clark said in November of the same year, 'I firmly believe that the European war will end before November 1944, and we will achieve final victory.' Undersecretary of the Army Patterson said in August 1944, 'Achieving a complete victory in the war against Germany is no longer a distant prospect.' In addition, Chief of Staff Marshall published an article in the December 17th issue of 'Army and Navy' magazine, saying, 'Before my article is published in the magazine, the European war may very well be declared over.' There are countless empty words of comfort like these."</p>
<p>The German offensive, with lightning speed, destroyed one-third of the Western Front's American combat power in less than three weeks. The stretched American censorship institutions tried to conceal the facts, but instead leaked the truth all the more, truly proving "the more you try to hide, the more it shows." The anxious national mood, with a thousand threads of thought, wanted to inquire about everything, such as: Since the Three-Power Conference was decided in Dumbarton Oaks, why has it been delayed (Roosevelt had to remain silent to appease the recent public outcry)? Why has the Atlantic Charter, generally recognized as a symbol of Allied unity, been quietly set aside? Are the British troops under Montgomery standing by idly while the American troops fight hard (a unit of British troops on the Belgian front only appeared on January 4th, according to a report from the Associated Press)? In addition, there are numerous problems such as Poland, Greece, Chongqing, and others that disturb the American people's spirit.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and his party could not cope with these domestic phenomena. They were extremely anxious, very worried that the accumulated resentment of the people, once it erupted, would be unstoppable. Therefore, in order to alleviate this popular psychology, they launched a fierce and desperate battle in the Philippines. Today's enemy America may be invincible, but once it suffers a setback, its domestic situation will take a sharp turn for the worse. The fate of the Greater East Asia War is decided at this moment.

<h3>Mayor Zhou Meets with Reporters: Expresses His Political Aspirations and Announces Three Major Plans to Stabilize the People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou took office, he has paid attention to city affairs, especially the current issues of rising prices, inadequate supplies, and corruption among officials. He is committed to exerting his efforts to serve as a representative. Mayor Zhou, in his busy political affairs, met with reporters from the city's Chinese newspapers at the Nanking City Government yesterday (29th) morning to answer questions raised by the reporters. The content of the question-and-answer session is as follows:</p>
<p>Three Major Plans to Stabilize the People's Livelihood</p>
<p>(Question) When Mayor Zhou first took office in the city, all the main authorities were eagerly awaiting the stabilization of the people's livelihood, the elimination of corruption, and other issues. What are the important plans and policies of the Nationalist government?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most important thing at present is to stabilize the people's livelihood. I will start with the following three items: (A) Price issue: Lowering prices directly and strictly controls prices. There is currently an important plan to suppress black market rice prices, which is being actively implemented and is expected to be resolved soon. (B) Production increase issue: The fundamental way to stabilize the people's livelihood is to increase production. Plans are being made to increase coal and electricity production to meet the essential needs of the people. The industrial system must be developed, and the supply of daily necessities must be ensured. This is currently under study. (C) Corruption issue: During wartime, various prices have risen, and corruption has become rampant. Shanghai is the most affected, and this is due to human causes. I will ensure that such human factors are eliminated. I have decided to severely punish those who manipulate prices and engage in profiteering after they are discovered. Regarding the corruption of officials, I recently summoned the responsible persons from the courts and told them that I feel that the current investigation of corruption cases is too slow due to legal procedures. The effect of curbing corruption is diminished because the cases are dealt with using external methods. For example, a case this year may not be resolved until next year, which reduces its effectiveness. Therefore, I am determined to resolve corruption cases quickly. For example, the recent case of the alteration of the Wuhan lottery tickets was dealt with quickly and severely. I hope that the prosecutors will pay attention to corruption cases and implement (1) no bail, (2) quick trial, and (3) the highest penalties.</p>
<p>In the future, I will seek instructions from the Central Government and be given full authority to deal with corruption and financial cases by the Security Command with military trials, without leniency.</p>
<p>Corruption and Treacherous Merchants to be Punished by Military Law</p>
<p>(Question) Prices are rising due to various reasons, but there is a lack of supply, which is a major reason. Has the municipal government established a plan to improve the control of commodity sources?</p>
<p>(Answer) The central government is handling the smoothing of commodity sources and the supply of goods.</p>
<p>(Question) In the previous "14th case," only low-level personnel were investigated and punished, which is not enough to cleanse the government. Does the current government have the determination to arrest traitors? If such cases or treacherous acts are encountered, will they be investigated thoroughly?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is not only the determination of the municipal government, but also the intention of the central government. Therefore, we are determined to thoroughly investigate and punish any corruption or treacherous acts in the future.</p>
<p>(Question) In the past, there have often been cases where, after investigation and punishment were implemented, they were just talk on paper. For example, the recent case of the lottery ticket fraud of Gongda (i.e., the Big Six lottery ticket), which involved tens of millions of yuan, has disappeared without a trace. Also, there was a case involving ten merchants in Xiaru. It is said that the case file was lost and bail was paid, but there has been no further news. Does the mayor plan to thoroughly investigate this case?</p>
<p>(Answer) The fact that legal procedures are slow and cumbersome is a reality. In the future, we will adopt military trials.</p>
<p>Manipulation of Gold is Under Investigation</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, the price of gold has been rising again, and prices are rising again. What measures does the government have to deal with this? In the previous case of gold manipulation, a large number of people were acquitted because gold was not considered a major commodity. This has only fueled the rise in gold prices. Gold is the only guarantee for legal tender and represents all commodities. Therefore, manipulating gold is a serious crime that disrupts the current financial situation. I hope you will investigate and deal with it severely to curb this trend.</p>
<p>(Answer) I have ordered the police and security authorities to secretly investigate. If anything is found, it will be dealt with severely.</p>
<p>Proper Handling of Price-Fixing by Trade Associations</p>
<p>(Question) Trade associations raise prices and conspire with corrupt economic authorities. They exploit this phenomenon and mutually benefit, causing prices to soar. Please deal with this strictly.</p>
<p>(Answer) In the future, we will take appropriate measures, and the Economic Bureau has also been improved.</p>
<p>Finally, reporters asked questions about municipal issues and donation of resources to the city. Mayor Zhou answered each question in detail.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhou Encourages Employees of the Goods Allocation Office to Improve Their Shortcomings and Work Hard in Their Future Duties</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou met with the high-ranking officials of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office at the Municipal Government yesterday (29th) morning at 10:00 a.m. The attendees included the chief of the office, planning officials, and section chiefs. After briefly reviewing each person's background, Mayor Zhou gave an impromptu speech. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Since I took office as the Mayor of Shanghai, I am determined to create a new Shanghai. The Goods Allocation Office has a close relationship with the citizens. In the past, there have been many criticisms from the outside. I believe that Director Liu will definitely be able to learn from the past and improve. I hope that all of you, under his leadership, will correct past shortcomings and work hard in your future duties. The supply of allocated goods is limited. The government will seek ways from all relevant parties. As for how to allocate fairly, I hope everyone will cooperate in their respective positions. It is necessary to distribute them equally, so that those who need a lot get a lot, and those who need little get little. We must strictly adhere to the principles of not causing difficulties, not deducting, and not colluding with shops for fraud. Work hard with conscience, contribute more to society, and you will be praised by all parties. In the past, special allocations were often unequal, so adjustments should be made. In terms of personnel, there were many people in the past, and it was very costly. There were inevitably people with uneven quality, so efforts should be made to adjust. Use an objective perspective to assess daily performance. For those who are not good, try to eliminate them, so as to achieve the goal of getting things done with fewer people and more capabilities. At the same time, I hope that everyone will pass on my words to the staff below and work together."</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Structure to be Adjusted</h3>
<p>Since Director Zhou took office as the head of the Municipal Police Bureau, he has been innovating and striving to promote major police affairs. It is understood that the Bureau, in order to increase work efficiency, has decided to adjust its internal structure. The original nine departments will be reduced to seven. Each department and section will also be merged or reduced depending on the complexity of the work. The original large sections of each sub-bureau will be reorganized into four sections. The transmission of official documents will be simplified and the efficiency of the work will be improved. Adjustments will also be made to personnel. It is expected that the changes will be implemented in early next month.</p>
<h3>Detective Carries Smoke Bomb; Suffers Accident Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 29th) morning, a No. 2 tram, fully loaded with passengers, caught fire while heading outwards. The incident occurred at 11:20 AM when the tram was stopped at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road. Thick smoke immediately filled the air, attracting onlookers. Passengers inside, unable to wait for the conductor to open the doors, scrambled out through the ticket window and over the iron gates. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured. According to investigations, the cause of the accident was that Li Moukun, a detective from the Judicial Section of the Chongshan Road Police Sub-bureau, was ordered to carry a smoke bomb to the Inspection Section of the Fuzhou Road Headquarters. Unaware of the dangerous nature of the device, he boarded the tram, resulting in the unfortunate incident. His hands and clothes were slightly burned and damaged.</p>
<h3>Changes in Directors of Shangnan and Shangchuan Road Bureaus</h3>
<p>It is approved that director of the Shangnan and Shangchuan Road Bureaus, which are subordinate to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, will be replaced. The current director is being replaced, and the deputy director will remain Zhang.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Branch Holds Its First General Meeting of the Year</h3>
<p>In accordance with regulations, the Shanghai Special Municipality Investment Committee's ten committee members are to be appointed by the current mayor. To welcome the newly appointed ten committee members and to discuss the epidemic prevention plan for the 34th year of the Republic, the committee recently convened its first general meeting of the year. Attendees included Mayor Zhou Mouhai (represented by the Chief Qing), Deputy Director Moumou, Secretary Chen Yidao, Major General Shibata Kazuo, Lieutenant Colonel Honma Shigeo, Lieutenant Colonel Onodera Yoshio, Ambassador Ryunosuke Kiyosawa, and Chen Zhongdong, among others. Director Lu Jianzhi of the Health Department and Director Chen Zhong of the Central Epidemic Prevention Bureau also attended the meeting. Secretary Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, delivered a speech, followed by a speech from Director Chen, who stated that all vaccines and materials used for epidemic prevention this year would be manufactured by the Central Epidemic Prevention Bureau of each country. Local epidemic prevention committees needing materials could apply directly for them. Next, the director reported on the epidemic prevention work of the past year. Chen Yeqin reported on the number of people vaccinated, stating that approximately 200,000 people had been vaccinated to date. With more than half the time remaining, it was hoped that citizens would be vaccinated. Finally, the meeting discussed the action plan for this year.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Reserve Certificates and Cash; Gradual Resolution Expected</h3>
<p>To alleviate the issue of cash shortage in the market, the Central Reserve Bank of China began issuing new 500-yuan and 10-yuan banknotes yesterday. According to sources from the local financial sector, banks and money shops have recently faced frequent requests for reserve certificates, leading to a shortage of cash in circulation. To facilitate withdrawals for customers, banks and money shops, when customers withdraw large sums, would pay part of the amount in cash and issue payment orders for amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan. The Banking and Money Industry Association believes that the cash shortage is causing inconvenience for businesses and the public. Therefore, it convened a joint meeting recently, requesting the Central Reserve Bank to find ways to alleviate the cash shortage. Now that the bank has issued new banknotes, the situation should gradually improve. At the same time, the practice of issuing payment orders for customer withdrawals should gradually decrease.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chongqing Bank Moves to New Location for Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chongqing Bank, located at 176 Jinling Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII), was established in February of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Its original location was in the Wuzhou Building on Fuzhou Road. Due to business expansion, it has moved to its current address. Zhu Chunxi remains the manager of the bank. Yesterday (the 28th) was the opening day at the new location. Hundreds of prominent figures from local society, including Wen Guanting, Lin Kang, Qin Quanxia, Bo Gu, and Gu Nanqun, as well as many depositors, attended, creating a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Downed Enemy Aircraft on Display to the Public Starting Yesterday; Many Citizens Visit</h3>
<p>The enemy aircraft that attacked the outskirts of the city on the 20th of this month were shot down by Allied air forces, totaling seven aircraft. Among them, a P-51 type plane crashed in Qingpu County. To boost the citizens' awareness of air defense, the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, with the assistance of the Allied Military and Naval Reporting Department, transported the downed enemy aircraft and parachutes to Shanghai. Starting on the 29th, they are being publicly displayed inside the racetrack from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily, allowing the public to visit. Yesterday was the first day of the exhibition, and a large number of citizens visited. The exhibition will continue until February 2nd, and all are welcome to visit. However, visitors are requested to maintain order on the premises.</p>
<h3>New Association Shanghai Branch Hosts Banquet for Zhao Xuan; Director Chen Offers Three Suggestions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese News Association hosted a banquet yesterday (the 29th) at the Gongnan Restaurant to welcome newly appointed Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department, Deputy Director Sun Jing, who was in Shanghai on official business, and Liu, the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office. Deputy Director Sun, Director Liu, and other guests attended on time, including Lieutenant Moumou and Second Lieutenant Moumou of the Army, Adjutant Maeda, Captain Tanaka of the Propaganda Department, Trustees Bei Moufu and Akita Masao, Maboroshi Kazuo, Wang Bingnan, Director Matsudaira Kiyoshi of the Information Department of the Japanese Ambassador's Shanghai Office, Vice Consul Fukama, Secretary Kawamura, Bureau Chief Fan Zuesheng of Tongjian, and Sanzhai Moumou of the China Service News Agency. Local attendees included Chairman Moumou, Moumou, Yu Yu, Moumou, Moumou, Bao Tianxiao, Lou Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Moumou, Zhang Shanyan, Chairman Li Sihao of the Chinese Journalists Association, and representative Moumou of the Association, totaling over a hundred people. Chen Binhe, Director of the Shanghai Branch, and executive directors such as Moumou, Moumou, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiongbo, Gong Jingsu, Chen Riping, Moriyama Takashi, and Feng Yelei warmly welcomed the guests. Director Chen Binhe delivered a welcome speech, followed by a speech from Director Zhao. The banquet concluded at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>Director Chen Binhe stated in his speech: "Today, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese News Association welcomes Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department, Deputy Director Sun, and Director Liu of the Municipal Propaganda Office. We are grateful for their presence, as well as for the participation of the Allied Press Corps and members of the Chinese and Japanese cultural and journalistic communities."</p>
<p>"Director Zhao and Deputy Director Jing are both from the journalistic field. Director Liu is familiar with the News Association. Therefore, there is no need to introduce them in detail. On behalf of this welcoming gathering, I would like to offer three suggestions to the authorities: First, I hope to enrich news sources and news materials. Regarding the improvement of news materials, I hope to strengthen the central unified management and improve the treatment of reporters. In terms of both funding and personnel, the News Association will do its best. Secondly, among the news sources, newspapers are the most important. However, the price of newspaper paper has skyrocketed. Before the incident, the price of newspaper paper was three yuan per order. Now, it has risen to over 40,000 yuan, an increase of 15,000 times. This is simply outrageous."</p>
<p>"(Two) Improve the living conditions of news reporters and cultural figures. In recent years, prices have risen sharply. The news and cultural circles engaged in propaganda work are living in extreme hardship. I hope that Director Zhao will take steps to gradually improve the situation. Regarding the key distribution of supplies to news reporters, it should include all news workers. I deeply hope that the director will assist in the early realization of this.</p>
<p>(Three) Cultivate news talents. Currently, there is a great shortage of news talents. I hope that the Propaganda Department will establish institutions to cultivate new news talents. Although the Shanghai News Federation has a Young Journalist Training Class, it is small in scale and weak in strength. In the future, I hope that the department will pay special attention to this."</p>
<p>"In recent years, this gathering of the propaganda community is the most grand. This shows the enthusiasm and sincerity of the news and cultural circles towards the new three officials. We will work together to promote national policies and strive together under the guidance of propaganda administration."</p>
<p>Director Zhao's Speech</p>
<p>"I am unworthy of the hospitality today. Especially since I have served in the journalistic community for many years, and those present are all old and new colleagues, I am even more undeserving of this welcome. I originally declined the position of Director of the Propaganda Department due to a lack of talent. However, I was persuaded because Director Lin of the Ministry had become the Director of the Anhui Provincial Government, and I have experience in the news industry, so I could not refuse. I have always had the ideal of combining news and propaganda, and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss it with everyone."</p>
<p>"News focuses on faithful reporting. Propaganda focuses on enlightenment and guidance. Everyone knows this. If both are done well, then enlightenment can be achieved within the reporting. This is the so-called combination. Some may think that propaganda focuses on restriction, while news only focuses on reporting. However, propaganda and news are both aimed at the entire population, and there should be no opposition between the two. If all news is subject to restriction, then how can democracy be healthy? How can public opinion be expressed? This is not the government's original intention, nor is it something that the journalistic community will accept. However, if news reporting fails to embody national policies and guide the public, then its drawbacks will be immeasurable. In short, propaganda administration assists the journalistic community to fulfill its mission and develop its potential under national policies. The journalistic community should also fulfill its responsibilities of reporting and propaganda under national policies."</p>
<p>"Our country's news industry is only 70 or 80 years old. It has been thriving for only over 30 years. The government has not paid much attention to the news industry, or even treated it as an object of extra-legal regulation. This has created a situation where the journalistic community and the government unintentionally became opposed to each other. The influence of feudal politics is unspeakable. After the Northern Expedition in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the status of the journalistic community increased day by day, and the development of the news industry also made progress. As a result, the government also paid more attention to the news industry. Unfortunately, at this time of prosperity, the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, resulting in ten years of effort being ruined in one day. This is truly regrettable."</p>
<p>"The National Government moved its capital in order to continue past achievements and promote them. Therefore, the Propaganda Department was established. Director Lin Baisheng was originally a journalist. When he became the director, he recalled the grand occasion of the past when the Newspaper Association held meetings, and the prosperity of the discussions. After Director Lin took office, he began to make arrangements, and the scale has been greatly improved to this day. I am not talented, and I will continue to implement this plan, and I will not forget my qualifications as a journalist. I will also continue the previous rules of Director Lin, so today I dare not be seen as the Propaganda Minister being entertained by the News Association, but I regard it as a gathering of colleagues in the Newspaper Association."</p>
<p>"Since I have this ambition, what I want to tell you is: First, in terms of the news industry, we must do our best to think about the industry and help the press, but under the current wartime conditions, I hope that you will use wartime systems to do things and do your best to save costs, so that we can overcome difficulties. What is especially important is that the national news industry must be united, not limited to one place or corner. Only through unity can strength be generated. Furthermore, with the cooperation of administrative structures, the strength will be even greater. Second, in terms of speech and reporting, as long as we strictly abide by national policies, we can publish as much as possible. I have a responsibility to guide the news, and the guidance will not be limited to trivial matters. Moreover, I must make the opinions of the people more widely known and provide timely instructions on the political situation, so that the government can obtain assistance from public opinion, serve as ears and eyes, and make up for the lack of research systems and fact-finding. However, I also hope that all reports will be based on facts and should not be distorted or exaggerated. The content can be faithfully recorded for government reference."</p>
<p>"I have been in the journalism industry for a long time, and my friends are all over the north and south. What I said to my colleagues back then is what I have said above. After twenty years, I am now working with my colleagues again. This is the happiest opportunity in my life. Therefore, I still hope to use the words I discussed at the time to roughly present to you. With your efforts, the success of China's news industry in the future will be inevitable."</p>

Now, with the consent of all the school's members, we are responding to your newspaper's charitable act of 'Special Fundraising' and have expanded the enrollment of ten charity students each in the first and second grades of senior high school and in each grade of junior high school. Any outstanding young people recommended by your newspaper will be granted a special exemption from the entrance examination and will attend classes with the regular students, in order to cultivate talent. We hope you will make recommendations. This is of utmost importance. Please note that the school is now located at 107, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road."</p>
<p>A letter from Chen Chushan, Principal of Minguang Middle School, states: "To whom it may concern, our school has set the beginning of the next semester for February 1st, with classes starting on the 5th. In order to respond to your newspaper's movement to rescue those deprived of education, if your newspaper recommends poor students to study at our school, they will be allowed to pay only half of the tuition. This is also to fulfill a small part of the educational community's responsibility. Our school's tuition fees at all levels are in accordance with the regulations of the Education Bureau. We are writing to inform you of this and hope you will take note."</p>
<p>A letter from the Private Luye Elementary School states: "To whom it may concern, our school is organized by the staff of Luye. The tuition fee is only 500 yuan. Mr. Yang Fusheng, the headmaster, is still concerned that some students' parents may not be able to afford it, so he has made further provisions for 60 students with subsidies. We have entrusted your publication and the Xinwen Bao newspaper to recommend 40 of them (20 each). The remaining 20 will be applied for by outstanding students at our school. If there are any students who are from poor families, have excellent grades, and live relatively close to our school, please recommend and send them to our school, and we will waive their enrollment fees."</p>
<p>Nanyang Middle School Enthusiastically Raises Funds</p>
<p>A letter from the students of the Nanyang Middle School branch states: "To whom it may concern, recently, prices have soared and tuition fees have increased sharply, making it extremely difficult to rescue those deprived of education. The students of our school feel that we should do our best to help, so we have launched a fundraising campaign for educational grants. Through the efforts of all the students, we have raised a total of 705,040 yuan. We will use 500,000 yuan to subsidize outstanding students from poor families at our school, and the remaining 205,040 yuan will be divided equally and sent to your publication and the Xinwen Bao newspaper to provide financial assistance. Although it is just a drop in the bucket, it represents our sincere intention."</p>
<p>Chongqing Bank's Inauguration Gift Supports Education</p>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Branch of Chongqing Bank states: "Your newspaper has the compassion to aid those in distress and is sensitive to the pain of reducing expenditures.

Now that our bank has moved to a new location, we have converted the gifts received from all sectors into cash and allocated it to support your newspaper's education assistance program. Enclosed is a check for 50,000 yuan. We hope you will accept it."</p>
<p>Practicing Thrift, Shifting Savings to Educational Grants</p>
<p>A letter from Fuhua Silk and Cloth Store states: "To whom it may concern, in order to practice wartime thrift, our store has completely eliminated winter solstice gifts to relatives and friends, as well as year-end banquets.

We are enclosing a check for 50,000 yuan and request that it be credited to the 'Fuhua Silk and Cloth Store Thrift Team.'

<h3>"Narcissus" Charity Performance: Fundraising for the Old People's Home</h3>
<p>Messrs. Wen Chanting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng and others have initiated a charity play performance to raise funds for the Old People's Home. They have invited renowned Shanghai actors Tang Ruoqing and Shi Hui, as well as other artists, to collaborate and perform for ten days starting from February 1st at the Carlton Theatre.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Old People's Home has been established for over 40 years. It houses over 350 elderly men and women over the age of 60 who are lonely and helpless. They are cared for entirely by nuns through solicitations and personal care. Currently, the home's funds are exhausted, and the expenses are huge, making it difficult to maintain. Although a 5 million yuan fundraising campaign was launched in October last year, the goal is still far away, and the home is heavily in debt, owing as much as 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Therefore, assistance is urgently needed, and we must fervently hope that kind people in society will help and continue to make broad fundraising efforts to awaken widespread sympathy and concern. Mr. Wen and others have initiated this charity performance. We hope that all sectors will enthusiastically purchase tickets during the period, both to enjoy the famous play and to help the elderly. It is a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Anning Pharmaceutical Factory Donates Glucose Syrup</h3>
<p>Anning Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory sent a letter to our office stating: "To whom it may concern, your newspaper's promotion of charitable causes has always been praised by people from all walks of life. Our factory mainly manufactures chemical drugs, such as glucose for injection and oral use, as well as calcium gluconate and other raw materials, for many years. We admire your newspaper's enthusiasm and dare not lag behind. We have specially prepared a type of glucose syrup to donate to poor teachers and educational assistance students. However, for the sake of solemnity, if any teachers or students need this medicine, please ask your newspaper to issue a certificate, which they can present to the Da Shanghai Sanatorium at 1050 Daxing Road (bring your own container - an empty beer bottle is sufficient). After Dr. Xu Xuyu signs it, they can collect it with the certificate (every day from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM). This small gesture expresses our sincere heart. As it is a public welfare matter, we hope that your newspaper will provide assistance, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>
