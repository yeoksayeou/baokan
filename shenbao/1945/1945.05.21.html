<h3>日召集大陸關係官員　在相邸舉行懇談　決具體增強物質方面戰備</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日政府爲具體增强大東亞物質方而戰備，十九·二十兩日，由首相召集與大陸有關之人員，於一首相官邸舉行懇談，結果意見一致，今後將本此決議，積極實施。二十日並由情報局發表如次：</p>
<p>政府爲完遂大東亞戰爭，關於大束亞之迅速團結及强化，尤其當前物的戰備之迅速强化，有依綜合的見地，討論具體方策之必要，爰於十九。二十兩日，在內閣總理大臣主持下，召集大陸關係各官會議，經懇談結果，意見完全一致，務使今後應採取之具體措置，一無遺憾。</p>
<p>日首相致詞</p>
<p>日本帝國所希求者，爲芟除攪亂東亞之禍根，建設道義的大東亞新秩序，德國之投降，與日本之完成戰爭毫無影響。日本基於最近歐洲所發生之事態，承認日·德·義三國協定及三國條約，以及與此有關之防共協定等條約之失效·決定今後立於新的觀點行動。此際所期望者，厥爲强化與東亞諸盟邦之協力，尤其中·日·滿三國，應同心一體，以此爲核心，團結發揮德力，斷然擊敗驕敵，確保大東亞之安定，照日本對於大陸之態度及方針，尤其對華政策，則堅確不動。關於對華政治，決本日本一貫之旣定方針，完成大東亞戰爭，以期大東亞之安定，現在大陸各地，允宜視戰局之推移及內外之情勢，一新決意，巾滿鮮團結一體，發揮物質上，精神上之綜合戰力，傾注全力，努力求其實現。</p>
<h3>東亞各地一周戰況</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　本周大東亞各地戰况如次：　　琉球方面，向列島兩端逐次南下之敵機動部隊，共後爲岡重建其艦隊空軍，十三·十四兩日再度來襲日本土，行動頗見價　，機動隊陣容，特設空母大見增加，搭載機及駕駛員則素質頗顯著低下，此可推想敵艦隊空軍巳蒙甚大打擊。同時，冲繩本島，慶良間列島，伊江島等航空基地之經營，亦在積極進行，冲繩本島不僅北·中兩機塲，即其他飛機塲，亦舉全力急速趕建。伊江島之飛機塲，業已完成，有小型機數架開始活動，同時本烏四周之特設空母，對此等飛機塲補充相當機數，然以機塲之規模及飛繼數量等關係，敵機活動甚爲低調。十三日約出動六十架，十四日·十五日百餘架，十六日二百餘架，十九日約七百架，十八日三百四十架。又日軍特別攻擊隊及航空部隊，仍繼續猛攻敵接濟路綫，其攻擊目標爲敵艦船·飛機塲·物資倉庫，因之敵機塲連日火勢甚旺，擊毀之敵艦船以及敵屍體漂流海面，此可顯示敵軍損失極爲慘重。</p>
<p>馬里亞納，小笠原方面，一時曾突進九州方面作戰術轟炸之B29型機，其後再度轟炸都市，似轉取濫炸之戰略轟炸，硫黃島之小舉機，亦於十七一日來襲關東方面。又於日本土沿岸投下磁性機雷，似爲　日本土沿岸航勝，妨害補給之主要戰略。</p>
<p>呂宋島，納里安道方面之敵軍，四月二十六日侵入碧瑤後，敵主力於後方準備攻擊，一部進入碧瑤鎭東方之吉可斯布來斯附近。日軍精銳於碧　鎭東方高地，仍繼續挺身突擊，東部薩拉克薩拉山　方面戰况，至五日漸形活躍化，呂宋島之戰鬥，已呈全面活動。</p>
<p>民答那峨，納卯方面之日軍部隊，依然確保納卯北方之王要陣地，自敵登陸以來至十四日正，死傷約二千五百名，日軍並擊沉敵運輸船四艘，破壞飛機十二架，戰車六輛，裝甲車入輛，車輛七十三輛。現敵軍次第增援兵力，繼續進行作戰，納卯北方戰綫之日砲台，對其開始熾烈砲擊，擊潰敵主要陣地。</p>
<p>泰拉干島，敵繼又企圖侵入飛機塲方面，凈水池及油　地帶，但悉經日軍擊退，十一日以後之戰綫，陷於膠着狀態。</p>
<p>緬甸方面，五月一日於仰光南方地區降落之敵軍為非洲兵，十二日於仰光河口附近降落之敵軍為　里島二十六師之一部，三日遂侵入仰光市內，急速强化附近陣地，自四日起似巳開始使用仰光北方飛機塲。規沿鐵道南下中之敵，四月二三晶通過庇古，逐次向仰光繼續北下，又沿伊洛瓦底江南下中之敵四月三十日經阿朗密，三日到達夫羅姆尼，在仰光中間之明拉北方，與在阿拉坎沿岸登陸侵入塔加布北方之西非八十二師會合，更策動前進。</p>
<p>印度洋方面，自四月三十日至五月三日，於安　曼羣島卡尼科巴島方面蠢動中之敵機動部隊，十三日更於近海出現，加以轟炸掃射，自十六日以來，又於蘇門答臘北方海域蠢動，該方面敵機動部隊行動，宜加嚴密警戒。</p>
<h3>緬甸綫雨季前　呈對峙狀態　英發表仰光作戰艦名</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地二十日中央社電　敵軍於優勢空軍掩護下，沿曼達萊街道强行南下後，其機甲部隊於五月初旬遂突入仰光，其後恐日軍反攻，乃整備强化陣容，日軍部隊則逐次整備軍勢，確保戰略優勢地位，對敵戰綫間隙果敢反擊，展開反攻。規緬甸戰綫兩軍於雨季即軍之前，呈對峙狀態，敵以英軍第七十六師自北方前進，以十九師一部自西方前進，全岡侵入　部高原地帶，現兩軍於該方面展開小規模戰鬥。蓋日單十八日未明，於勞克沙克（美格得拉東北七十公里）及其於對約六百名敵兵加以强襲，且將敵軍包圍攻擊，日軍戰果計敵遺屍約九十其，破壞追擊砲五門，重輕機關槍七挺，其他軍需品多數。其他部隊於砲兵掩護下，於二十日拂曉對加洛（美格得拉東方五十公里）北方四十公里敵軍急襲，使其沒走，　棄屍體五十具，日軍鹵獲彈藥多數，又日軍其他部隊，九晶對婆　　（美格得拉東方約一百五十公里）西方三十公里之二百匪團展開掃蕩戰，　獲目動小槍六十支及彈藥多數。又侵入加洛之敵軍，因日軍反攻，戰力已極減低，現正逐與第一戰綫部隊交替中。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　據哥命萊電，東南亞洲軍司令部十八日宣稱：此次參加英軍於仰光登陸作戰之海軍。計有戰艦伊麗蓓絲皇后號（三萬六千噸），法國戰艦里煦安號（三萬五千噸），以及賽夫·錫闌·托龍籌巡洋艦，貝恩·派拉台·洛巴克·萊司鮑斯·里托等驅逐艦，此外，並包括印度海軍之史爾浦·塞特萊琪·柯亞利·英海軍之費利凱。特　脫·洛基·司貝依等艦。</p>
<h3>對沖繩敵艦船　日繼續猛攻</h3>
<p>南西各島基地二十日中央社電　日航空部隊其後繼續對西南各島方而之敵單海上部隊加以猛襲，十八日夜於冲繩海面以空中魚雷攻擊敵特設空母一艘，使其發生大火，對巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘及大舉輸送船一艘，亦加以雷擊，使其蒙極大損害。又其他一隊對敵輸送船一艘，驅逐艦一艘，投下大型炸彈，將之擊毀。又十八日深更至十九日黎明，空襲伊江島機塲，使其數處發生大火，並繼續襲擊冲繩本島北機場及附近設施，使其數處起火。</p>
<h3>泰拉干戰況　漸呈熾烈</h3>
<p>南西方面基地二十日中央社電　十一日以來，陷於　着狀態之泰拉干島陸上戰鬥，自敵軍準備進攻以來，戰况日趨緊張，十六日　來，敵對東海岸阿馬爾方面施以艦砲射擊，企圖登陸，同時對飛機場以東方面，砲擊與艦砲擔護下，敵兵力開始總攻擊，與日守備部隊展開爭奪戰，目下兩軍對峙綫爲從飛機場北方，經凈水池以迄油田地帶北側。敵登陸以來，最初之接近戰鬥漸呈熾烈，日挺進突擊隊日見活躍，已斃敵約一百五十餘名，炸毀裝貨卡車三輛，輕機槍三挺，營房三處，物資倉庫二所，綜計擊斃敵登陸軍三分之一，日軍雖爲寡兵，但仍確保主要陣地，於各處擊碎敵軍。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>強化消防設施</h3>
<p>最近本市迭次發生火災，受害範圍及程度，較爲廣大者，如不久之餘姚路，昨日之山西路火災事件，尤足令人寒心！</p>
<p>按本市消防設施在全國各地中，雖較完警，但以人口密集，寸土千金，中下之家，居處　　，一有火災發生，仍不免牽連受災。所以，在平時對於消防設施，已嫌不足應實際需要。矧在戰時，敵機空襲與轟炸，在所不免，消防設施，尤有特別強化之必要。</p>
<p>關於強化消防設施，就實際情形而論，有的宜以當局爲主積極進行，有的宜由當局與人民合作或由市民自行進備，茲略舉所見，以供各有關方面注意與參考。</p>
<p>就當局對今後消防設施所應注意者而言，一爲籌集經常輕費，有計劃地改善及補充公共消防設備，二爲改善消防機關人員非常時期服務辦法，並改善其待遇，確定獎勵及懲罰辦法。凡特別有功者廠有名譽及物質上之獎賞，其服務不力乃至有不道德行爲者，則須公開及般厲懲罰，以期賞罰嚴明。三爲成立監督機關，擔負戰時消防設施及消防工作之最高監督任務，以期統一加强本市之消防事業。並對消防人員實施嚴格訓練。</p>
<p>就當局與民間合作推行者而言，首爲由官方代表及民間領袖，組織非常時期消防設計委員會（假定），以合官民雙方力量，進行有關本市消防之調查硏究及設計工作。對於當局發動指導，而需要民間出錢出力之消防工作，即由該機關負責勸導推進。希望本市保甲組織，對此能起領導作用，利用保甲機構爲本市今後消防事業有力之輔助。輿論界與有關常局之合作，自無待言。</p>
<p>更進一步言，今後本市之消防工作，實爲直接攸關市民生命財產之工作，必須由市民自動協力。今日最急要者，一爲普遍開鑿井泉，以備一旦自來水源發生陣得時，即可利用井水，而不致臨時慌張失措；二爲無力置備滅火機者，每家必須預備相當的滅火用沙土及儲水，以備必要時應用；三爲救死療傷之必需品，亦須有相當準備，尤共是急救藥品，各自量力，早爲購備。以上三者，對於入口最審集之處，尤爲急需，希望保甲及隣里有識人士，應即盡力勸導。</p>
<p>本市對於防空演習，雖已屢次舉行，但市民對於防空時期消防工作，恐仍求嫻習，一旦有事，或仍不免慌張無措。所以，我們認爲以後尚須多多舉行消防演習，使市民充分了解出事時如何不妨得消防人人員工作，並進而充分了解如何協助消防人員之搶救工作。</p>
<p>工廠區域，鬧市及貧民　居之處，消防設施，尤當首光力加强化。對於消防設備完善之工廠商店住宅等，予以讚揚，藉使近處居民觀摩倣效。對於協力消防有功之市民及保甲人員，應有相當獎勵。深信如能循此努力，强化消防設施，增加消防力量，則不難使本市成爲消防模範都市，並減少因火災遭受之損害。</p>

<h3>東台縣現況</h3>
<p>— 黃莪</p>
<p>地理沿革</p>
<p>東台縣位居范公　上，為南北往來　　，　屬泰州，淸乾隆四十三年始析縣分置。范公　南起南通，北迄　寗，橫貫如　，東台，鹽城三縣，為宋時范仲淹所築，原為防禦海水倒灌之用，今則海勢東遷，范堤以東，距海百餘里，始瀕海濱，以是昔日僅供　鹽之草茅荒土，今則泰半為種植豆　棉花玉　　之　　田　，滄海桑田，除垢谷　遷，洵不　也。范　以西。</p>
<p>河港縱橫，溝渠廣關，大都來自運堤所宜洩之淮湖諸水。即所謂裏下河，故灌溉既便，土壤肥沃，出產甚豐，夙稱魚米之鄉。事變前，東台縣除受民國十年二十年因運堤潰決之大水災外，僅十六孫傳芳兵潰波江北退時，曾略受其亂兵擄掠，餘則金吾不禁，七鬯不驚，雖歷史上有各之洪楊刦亂，亦未波及。民股物阜，樂業安居，官斯土者，自昔即有所謂「金如　，銀東台」之稱，民情之淳懦，蓋於此可見！</p>
<p>治安情形</p>
<p>中日事變發行後，淞滬首　兵禍，翌年三月戰事波及江北，佔領鹽　。於是各縣秩序混亂。遊民　起，攫繳民間槍枝，勒派苛捐雜稅，人民所受痛苦，均隱忍而不敢言。但自二十九年後，新四軍渡江北來，由靖江泰縣江面向北挺進，首與保安第四旅何克謙部遭遇作戰，何部一無抵抗而退，於是渝雀府乃調軍二萬餘，由八十九軍軍長李守維統率圍剿，於黃橋一役，全軍覆沒，李亦以身殉難。新四軍經此一戰後，聲勢大振，乘勝推進，一變而下東·鑒·車三縣，而彼時兩淮，已先被徐州南下之日軍攻陷，渝省府初則遷治東台，繼則遷治興化，侷處一隅，極爲狼狽，雖欲力維殘局，亦不可得。</p>
<p>民國三十年春，日軍再度由通如進攻東鑒，復打通運河綫，佔領高寳，圍攻興化，同時蘇魯邊區遊擊副總指揮李長江駐軍泰州，率部參加和運，於是和平區域，日益拓廣，新四軍及渝雀府均不得不放棄交通據點，退而散佈鄉村，而鄉村人民逐不堪其擾，雖窮僻之區亦難倖虎。東台縣北接鹽城，南鄰如畢傳西界興化，既屬蘇北各縣水陸交通必經之孔道，自亦爲兵家所必爭之據點，况在渝省府遷治東台期間，屢道轟炸，敗瓦頽垣，死傷纍纍，受禍之慘，雖次於鹽　，但罹害之酷，亦　古所未有。</p>
<p>捐稅重重</p>
<p>目前東臺縣水陸交通綫上之重要區鎭，　屬和平區域，為軍政力量所能及，范　以西，尙有極少數之渝方軍隊駐屯三四村莊，他則爲新四軍之活動地帶，其區城極廣。故人民負擔極重，有須向三方面繳納者，有須向二方面繳納者，純視其所處之地區爲斷。而捐納征收之方法，其屬一般人民者，則運用保甲制度，層層節制，每月按戶攤派；有不對產者，則每月按畝征收；而一般工商業者，則運用商會及同業公會機構，各業按戶比例均攤，以是無一可以　　。設有某人家住甲鎭，而其所營之百貨業，及兼營之綢緞業均在乙鎭，而其田產有在和平區之丙鄉，又有在新四軍及渝方範圍之丁鄉或戊村者，則其人除繳納營業稅，消費稅，統稅，所得稅，等等而外；則在甲鎭每月應繳住戶捐，在乙鎭母月應繳商會及同業公會所攤之捐款；在丙鄉每月應繳軍稱，軍草，在了鄉應繳公糧，田賦，幷須遵守二五減租及冬季減程之規定，在戊村更應繳納「老中央」所攤派之一切捐款。試問在如此情形下，人民負擔，寗有　類？况捐稅月月增加，漫無止境，以是商怨於市，農怨於野，大有不知「命在何時」之感，茲姑以　縣第二區安　鎭四月份所應攤之捐款，條列如後，以　一斑：</p>
<p>軍稻二千石（供應第×方面軍）。</p>
<p>軍米四百石（供應駐軍）。</p>
<p>軍米三十九石三斗（供應東台縣保安隊）。</p>
<p>軍草一百三十一石（供應東台縣保安隊）。</p>
<p>菜貼十萬元（供應東台縣保安隊）。</p>
<p>三曆碉堡一座。</p>
<p>地下室兩座。</p>
<p>築城工段一百零五丈。</p>
<p>右列三項係屬東台城防工事，分攤二據籌措，工料磚瓦並微　民伕建築者。</p>
<p>以現時東合糧價而言，衡量上列數字，亦極可觀。例如稻每石二萬七千元，米每石五萬元，草每担二千七百元。人民刧後餘生，何能勝此重擔？如此渴澤而　，似亦非治民之道。據聞去年秋問第×十×師駐防東台時，一請財神」之屬大盛，綁架勒贖，公開談判，毫無顧忌！當時稍具資產，出走泰州一埠適禍者，即達萬餘人！直至該部調防浙西，第二十五師接防東台，外出者始相率歸里。</p>
<h3>蘇省統一　船舶登記</h3>
<p>蘇州二十日中央社電　關於行政院建設部所管轄之輪船登記事務，近年來向由本省建設工程處代行辦理，嗣建部爲實施航運登記，於本年度即由航政局在本省各縣設立航政登記處，辦理船舶管理行政。茲為謀統一起見，　特與部方協議，經決定除本省鎭·松·吳江·滸浦四地由部方成立之航政登記處外，其餘巳成立者，一律飭於四月底搞　銷。其登記範圍亦以二十噸以上船舶為限，至於二十噸函復省府，並嚴飭所屬遵辦。</p>
<h3>渝謀調整對蘇關係</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據重慶廣播：重慶政權十七日於六全大會中，發表關於外交政策決議文六條，其內容爲興聯合國間關於國際和平及領土主權問題等，然對蘇外交關係特別另加一條，故重慶今後之外交方針，似以調整渝蘇國交爲重點，實頗値重視。其條文謂，「我國與蘇聯領土相接，今後外交亦將頻繁，故必須以最大誠意，締結友好關係」。</p>
<h3>解決波蘭問題　蘇提三項原則　史太林要求英美同意</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　據此間接獲消息：史太林議長對於英美攻擊蘇聯不應逮捕前往與蘇聯常局議和之波要人，曾作如下之答覆謂，「逮捕波人，乃爲我蘇聯依照法得之舉動，該項法律實與英國之「國域防衛案」相同。同時渠復提出關於解決波闌問題之三項基本原則，要求英美同意，　承認　布林政權爲將來波闌政府之根本核心，　依照與蘇聯維持友誼關係之政策來建立彼闌政府，　波闌政府應由與波闌人民素有密切聯　之人員來建立之</p>
<h3>德境美十五軍　佔領區範圍</h3>
<p>百倫廿日中央社電據此問接獲聯合國遠征軍最高司令部公報稱：德佔領區內之美第十五軍當局，於日前發出首次官方佈告謂，「美第十五軍將對德境內一萬四千平方公里之地區，加以佔領，該地區計爲薩爾盆地·萊因山谷·及西部魯爾工業區，以上該地區內包括杜斯爾道夫·愛森·科隆·特里安·科不林士導大城市。」</p>
<p>法对薩爾耳懷抱野心</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿日中央社電據此間接硬消息：巴黎各車站之墻上，均貼滿標語，調「法國再至強盛時，薩爾必屬我法人」·此項壁上之標語，實可明證法政府已有促使民衆從事戰爭，以佔領薩爾區之野心合國所享有之權利，則南國軍隊有權留駐於經過對共同敵人作奮力戰爭後所獲解放之區域內，實屬情理中事」。</p>
<h3>亞歷山大指責　蒂托軍隊行動</h3>
<p>日內瓦二十日中央社電　據英方特派員獲自意大利聯合國軍司令部消息稱：亞歷山大特於昨日向地中海戰區之反軸心軍頒發訓詞，其內容略謂，「南斯拉夫蒂托將軍現欲借重武力，以實現彼之要求，爲目前極明顯之事實。我等作戰迄今，亦無非思阻遏此種動輙以武力解決各種問題之舉動，我人之一貫政策，乃爲必須經過各國政府間詳細硏討與慣重商議，始可實行所謂變更領土分配。然目前蒂托將軍有意採用武力與軍事佔領之方式，以建立其提議，故我等爲阻止此種無理舉動，不得不再行作戰」云云。</p>
<p>南國答辯</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　據南斯拉夫電台昨廣播：南國戰事情報部已發出答覆英美關於托里埃斯特及附近地區領城問題之公報，略謂，「南國軍隊仍有留駐於已解放地區內之權利」。同時該公報復稱，「我等此項答獲，乃按照聯合國合作精紳所發，今南國旣為聯合國中之一國，亦應享有各</p>
<h3>國際裁判所　美檢察官已任命</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電：白宮當局宣稱，美政府主張在國際裁判所審判之第一戰爭罪犯，其最後決定須交檢察官判斷，美國已任命大理院推事傑克遜爲檢察官，希望英蘇法三國儘速任命檢察官。該項聲明中所稱國際裁判所，與現在設於倫敦之戰爭犯罪委員曾並不同樣，美總統新聞關係秘書說明稱，「現在戰爭犯罪委員會，係告發嫌疑犯之一稱陪審制度，目下組織中之國際裁判所·係專事審理重要罪犯者</p>
<h3>黎巴嫩　局勢嚴重</h3>
<p>日內瓦二十日中央社電　據開羅電：開羅政治界近鑒於里文達，尤以黎巴嫩等國在政治上有反常之發展，極感不安。由大馬色傳來未證實之報告謂，黎巴激局勢益趨嚴重，目前幸有法全權公使貝奈特將軍來至該地，致使危局未能立即爆裂。當地之親法派於勝利日作示威行動時，竟將黎巴嫩之國旗強行扯破，並且高呼「特戈爾的黎巴嫩」之口號，同時亦有反法份子作同樣之舉動。埃及國內之黎巴嫩民衆聲稱，開至彼等國內之法軍，包括大部份乘搭飛機來之高級軍官，而此項消息一時均未能證實。然法國會遣派巡洋艦一艘，將貝奈特將軍等一行載至黎國，以調回駐於該地之法軍，而不久又另一艘巡洋艦，載來大批法生力軍之事實，已無可諱言。</p>
<p>英國排解終鮮效果</p>
<p>英國會盡力牌解此項糾紛，但法增援駐軍如故，目前各界深盼在開羅之英國及埃及常局立即能出示良策，致使法黎兩國間之爭端得以解決。同時站于阿刺伯聯盟領袖者地位之埃及，亦亟思如何使此項糾紛得以早日結束，傳便里文達各國能以全力來建立一有效之聯盟。</p>

<h3>檢查公共塲所　警局規定辦法官警應出示身份證</h3>
<p>本市老閘分局，因查邇來迭有不法之徒，身着制服，冐充警官，潛往各旅館以檢查爲名，私擅敲詐，若不加取締，匪特人民受其損害，且影響警局信譽。而查其他娛樂塲所，亦有是項情事發生，故經該分局規定辦法，嗣後如有官警前住檢查，無論其身穿制服與否，應先收其身份證，交由各業主審閱登記後，再依次執行工作，否則各業主應即拒絕檢查，並隨時電告該分局，立派員警前往查緝，　維商旅，而安問問。</p>

<h3>中儲劑金融　銀根漸見寬鬆　上週米糧等價突起暴漲</h3>
<p>滬市金融市况，最近一週雖在國際風走雲動繼續演變中，然尚無劇烈變化。因中儲金證劵之發行，已見良好趨勢，收縮通貨，抑平物價，初步已收宏效，故人心日益安定。烚赤暗巿沉寂平靜，中途投機者固欲蠢動，但結果無隙可乘，是以僅週三週四價梢趨挺，週五仍復退回原狀，交易極為淸閒。公債紋銀穩定不動，華股盤旋微升，大部係多頭堅持扳不低價出籠，故脚地頗穩。中央儲備銀行為穩定金融調　頭寸頗為熱意，因此上週銀根寬鬆，現鈔缺乏現象漸漸減少。各行莊支付存戶現鈔較前增多，貼水流幣已見消戰。</p>
<p>至於工商各業，上週間似有轉向起色，工廠各業準備從事開工，恢復增產，原料及電力已在當局努力之下，困難之點，似可解決。惟因各方流言之刺激，投錢團積商乘機活動，以致物價步入高聲。尤其主要商品中之米，雜糧，油，糖及燃料突起暴漲，頗引起社會民生之不安。其主因雖在靑黃不接時期，來源漸稀，但投機商人之藉詞囤積居奇操縱市價，實爲激成物價騰貴之最大影響，一般市民希望經濟有關當局更進一步澈查取結，以安民生。</p>

<h3>滬郊盛行　播種雜糧</h3>
<p>頃據農業機關調查，本市四郊農作品，過去側重稻作，但今春一般農民，以去年四郊受蟲害損失頗鉅，收盛大滅，更由米俱高漲，一般雜糧，亦隨之上漲，且成本輕獲利多，故今春四郊農作，　糧　　數量，較往年增加　倍。</p>
<h3>地產價高　競購仍多</h3>
<p>本巿地產　務，並不以價格高漲，巿價紊　而逐漸減少，該同業及業外人競購者，反較以往爲多，故巿中心及巿區地價所漲之倍數，甚為驚人。茲將二十七年份及三十三年份，三十四年份五月份之本巿地價調查分列於左：</p>

<h3>本巿人力車業調查</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>上海的人力車巳有四十多年的歷史，最初因倣日木式造所以稱東洋車·當時車輪用木料構造，外國鐵圈，後來逐步改良，漸漸成爲今日的形式</p>
<p>現在上海人力車的分佈如下：前一·八區共一萬零一百六十三輛，車行一千零五十五戶。其餘滬北·南市，徐漕·滬西·浦東等區共有車八千四百五十一輛，車行共一千九百四十戶。人力車夫登記而領執照者有五萬多人，此外尚有未登記者四五萬人。其籍貫多屬蘇北之東台·鹽城·阜寗·高郵·泰縣·泰興等處，少數則屬南通·海門·啓東·如舉·淮陰·　應等地。</p>
<p>在戰前事行大部分佈在虹口·閘北·法租界一帶，戰後全部遷到法租界。滬西及蘇州河北。在十多年之前，上海有兩家車行，南和公司和飛星公司，每家都擁有幾千輛，後來全出賣了。現在蘇北聞人如顧竹軒·金九林等，也都擁有很多的車輛。</p>
<p>車租計算</p>
<p>車租是目前勞資雙方爭執的焦點，事主方面計算車租完全是依照新貨價，但在實際上說，他們租出的車子連三成新也不到，幾乎完全是破舊不堪的。據公會的算計、每部車一月的費用包括，看捐油漆。鐵器木器修理·意外修理·車身損失·工資及車間·承放人報酬·執照費·公會費·互助費·住宿費雜支·利息（官利）·　　　，　　爲一〇五六六九元，這探平均每車每日最低支出三九一三元。現在照黑市價每天車租收一千二百元，以二十七天計，共收三二四〇〇元，這樣似乎是虧本的，但因新舊貨的不同，當然這樣計算很不合理。盈虧也無從看出，據說依已往習慣，車租須勞資雙方代表協議後，始可實行，資方雖得主管機關許可，也不生效力。</p>
<p>車夫生活</p>
<p>車夫拉車分早晚南　，因為體力有限，早班每月約拉二十天，晚班每月只可拉十五天，平均每天可拉四五千元，除繳車租一千二百元，在飯攤上吃飯或　美餅一千五百元及燈油費二百元，草鞋費二百元外，所餘殊難瞻養家口。</p>
<p>從前車夫最受壓迫是巡捕濫撬照會，任意毆打，法捕房並有强迫華捕按月應繳照會若干張的事，租界收回以後，這種情形已經沒有。不過在晚上不點燈或點得不合防空規定，還要處罰。</p>
<p>車夫是苦力的一種，生活較其他任何部門的工人更窮苦，他們穿着破舊衫褲，不是一補再補，就是拖一片掛一片，有的甚至是不能遮體的。冬天棉衣　的破架一塊塊露出來，十年八年他們都難得買一件新衣。</p>
<p>他們一個人混一個人的還可以免强喝喝兩頓粥·有老婆孩子的四五口之家，就只好每天吃　頭　，赤豆，小米等雜糧來混日子，再加上柴和靑菜皮，　　乾，鹹魚等小菜，每天至少要三千多塊錢花在吃上。所以做一天還不够一天吃的。</p>
<p>車夫大約有三萬多人沒有家眷，他們都住在車行里，由承放人搭二三層擱樓供車夫住，每家寰行的二層擱樓上，住上二三十人，一間三層通擱擠住四五十人，在地舖骯髒的棉絮堆中，一個一個排列着，空氣汚濁得很發臭，地板是潮濕齷齪的，臭虫，白　整天的包圍着他們。</p>
<p>有二萬多的車夫是過草棚生活，他們在滬西越界築路一帶空地上化一些低康的地租，（有的沒有地租），搭一間簡陋小棚，幾百家幾千家的相連着，現在搭一間也非二十多萬元不行。這些棚子最怕失火，日前新加坡路就燒掉三千多間，能搭得起新房子的眞沒有幾個。</p>
<p>水荒也是棚戶最感響的，馬路上太平　頭有的雖在每天上午開二小時，但人數多，要取一兩桶水，總須走相當的路，並且要排隊等好些時候，棚戶區也有的掘水井，其實只不過是一個泥潭，但因爲出錢少，工料省，經手人又要揩油，所以井都很淺水質汚濁並有惡臭，是不能當做飲料的</p>
<p>還有一些有家屬的車夫，他們在滬西越界築路，打浦橋，菜市路底，盧家灣，斜橋一帶，租屋居住，一座　屋中總住有三四十家。</p>
<p>一般車夫文化水準頗低，十分之八是不識字，能看看書報的極少。他們對於社會，政治多不了解，只是憑丁自已的生活經騐與人們的口頭傳說而知道一些。現在也有一些知識較高的人，也改行做人力車夫，這多數是臨時性的，因爲，這行的收入畢竟是較做其他敎員之煩多一些的。車夫是有沒有娛樂的，冬數以玩紙牌，牌九，麻將爲消遣，此外，則到茶館者吃茶聽書，或者看看江北小戲。</p>
<p>互助組織</p>
<p>人力車夫集國工作的發動，萌芽於民國十六年，北伐軍克復上海後，有人組識工會，成立後有車夫三百餘人參加，工會設備有茶室，浴室，救濟工作，識字敎育等，會員按月繳會費三角。</p>
<p>二十二年秋，公共租界車夫何武山，徐竹林，朱鳳祥，倉公文等發起組織車夫救濟會，並得工部局許可成立，要求將每天車租小洋十三角減為十角，另繳救濟會經費一角。但工部局也宣佈成立「人力車夫互助會」，將當時車租規定為大洋八角五分。中有五分充互助會經費。現在互助費已漲到每月六百元，和車捐一同收。互助會有理事十二人，除理事外更有保管委員會，現在由　繼武氏負責保管經濟。</p>
<p>互助會設有三科：敎育科，救濟科，調查科。辦理車夫子女敎育，免費醫療接生等。救濟方面：車夫死亡喪費二萬元，家屬撫恤費二萬元，殘廢救濟費自五萬元至二萬元，改業小資本一萬兀，車夫家屬死亡救濟費二萬元。回鄕協助用資（鹽，阜，高，淮，一萬五千元。通，啓崇，如，泰，一萬元。家屬每人五千元）。火災房屋救濟費二千五百元。</p>
<p>二十三年三月一日，工部局為限制車夫人數，並計劃逐漸消滅車輛，故規定車夫四萬人，須至車務處登記拍照，車夫領取執照方可拉車，現在車夫登記是五月一日至七月三十一日　　每張三百元，地點在長興路車務處，但一般車夫對如何登記，何處取證，完全茫然，每每多跑四五次，領一張執照，往往要費幾天工夫，還不能到手！</p>

<h3>Japan Convenes Officials Related to the Mainland, Holds Discussions at the Prime Minister's Residence, Decides to Substantially Strengthen Material Readiness</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – To substantially strengthen material war preparedness in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese government, for two days on the 19th and 20th, had the Prime Minister convene officials related to the mainland to hold discussions at the Prime Minister's official residence. As a result, a consensus was reached, and they will actively implement the decisions from now on. The Information Bureau also announced the following on the 20th:</p>
<p>To consummate the Great East Asia War, and with a view to the swift unification and strengthening of Greater East Asia, especially the rapid enhancement of current material preparedness, there is a need to discuss concrete measures from a comprehensive perspective. Therefore, on the 19th and 20th, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, a conference of officials related to the mainland was convened. After earnest discussions, complete consensus was reached, ensuring that the concrete measures to be taken in the future will be without regret.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Address</p>
<p>What the Japanese Empire seeks is to eliminate the root of trouble that disturbs East Asia, and to build a righteous New Order in Greater East Asia. Germany's surrender has no impact on Japan's completion of the war. Based on the recent situation that has occurred in Europe, Japan recognizes the invalidity of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Three-Power Treaty, and related anti-communist agreements, and has decided to act from a new perspective from now on. What is expected at this time is to strengthen cooperation with East Asian allies, especially between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, who should be united in spirit and purpose, take this as the core, unite to exert virtue, resolutely defeat the arrogant enemy, and ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. Japan's attitude and policies toward the mainland, especially its policy towards China, remain firm and unwavering. Regarding politics towards China, it is determined to complete the Greater East Asia War in accordance with Japan's consistent established policy, in order to achieve the stability of Greater East Asia. It is appropriate to renew our determination in various parts of the mainland, taking into account the progress of the war situation and internal and external circumstances, and to unite with Manchukuo and Korea, exerting comprehensive material and spiritual combat power, and striving to realize it with all our efforts.</p>
<h3>One Week of War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia this week is as follows:</p>
<p>In the Ryukyu Islands, the enemy mobile units, which are gradually advancing southward towards both ends of the archipelago, have repeatedly been reinforced by their fleet air force. They came to attack the Japanese mainland again on the 13th and 14th. Their actions show considerable value. The organization of the mobile unit shows a significant increase in specially equipped aircraft carriers, but the quality of the aircraft and pilots shows a marked decline. From this, it can be inferred that the enemy fleet air force has suffered very heavy blows. At the same time, the operation of air bases such as Okinawa Island, Kerama Islands, and Ie Island is also being actively carried out. Not only the north and central airfields on Okinawa Island, but other airfields are also being rapidly constructed with all efforts. The airfield on Ie Island has already been completed, and several small aircraft have started operating. At the same time, specially equipped aircraft carriers around the island are replenishing a considerable number of aircraft to these airfields. However, due to the scale of the airfield and the number of aircraft, enemy aircraft activity is very low-key. About 60 aircraft were mobilized on the 13th, more than 100 on the 14th and 15th, more than 200 on the 16th, and about 700 on the 19th, 340 on the 18th. Also, the Japanese special attack units and air force continue to fiercely attack the enemy supply lines. Their targets are enemy ships, airfields, and material warehouses. As a result, enemy airfields are on fire for days, and destroyed enemy ships and enemy corpses are drifting on the sea surface. This shows that the enemy's losses are extremely heavy.</p>
<p>In the Mariana and Ogasawara Islands, the B29 type aircraft that once advanced to the Kyushu area for tactical bombing later bombed cities again, and seemed to have switched to a strategic bombing of indiscriminate bombing. The small aircraft on Iwo Jima also attacked the Kanto area on the 17th. They also dropped magnetic mines along the coast of the Japanese mainland, seemingly the main strategy to defeat navigation along the coast of the Japanese mainland and hinder supplies.</p>
<p>The enemy forces in the Luzon and Narian Road area invaded Baguio on April 26. The enemy's main force is preparing to attack in the rear, and a part has entered the vicinity of Gikisburais, east of Baguio Town. The Japanese elite troops are still bravely attacking on the highlands east of Baguio Town. The war situation in the Saraksasara Mountain area in the east is gradually becoming active on the 5th. The battle on Luzon Island has become fully active.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in the Mindanao and Davao area are still securing the key positions north of Davao. From the time the enemy landed until the 14th, about 2,500 people were killed or injured. The Japanese army also sank four enemy transport ships, destroyed 12 aircraft, six tanks, eight armored vehicles, and 73 vehicles. The enemy is now gradually reinforcing its forces and continuing to operate. The Japanese artillery in the northern Davao front is launching fierce artillery fire against it, destroying the enemy's main positions.</p>
<p>On Tarakan Island, the enemy continued to attempt to invade the airfield area, the water purification plant, and the oil field area, but were all repelled by the Japanese army. The battle line after the 11th is in a stalemate.</p>
<p>In the Burma area, the enemy troops who landed in the southern region of Yangon on May 1 were African soldiers, and the enemy troops who landed near the mouth of the Yangon River on the 12th were a part of the 26th Division of Reunion Island. On the 3rd, they invaded the city of Yangon and rapidly strengthened the nearby positions. It seems that the northern airfield of Yangon has been used since the 4th. The enemy going south along the railway passed Pegu on April 23 and gradually continued north to Yangon. The enemy going south along the Irrawaddy River passed Alon on April 30 and reached Frome on the 3rd. North of Mingla, in the middle of Yangon, they joined the West African 82nd Division, which landed along the coast of Arakan and invaded north of Tagab. Further campaigning to advance.</p>
<p>In the Indian Ocean, the enemy mobile units that were active in the Anam Islands and Nicobar Islands from April 30 to May 3 appeared again near the sea on the 13th, bombing and strafing them. Since the 16th, they have been active in the northern waters of Sumatra. The actions of the enemy mobile units in that area should be closely monitored.</p>
<h3>Burma Front Before the Rainy Season, a Standoff Occurs, Britain Announces Names of Warships in the Yangon Operation</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the enemy army forcibly advanced south along the Mandalay Road under the cover of superior air force, its armored units suddenly entered Yangon in early May. Afterwards, fearing a Japanese counterattack, it prepared and strengthened its formation. The Japanese army units gradually prepared their military strength, secured a strategic advantage, and resolutely counterattacked the gaps in the enemy front, launching a counterattack. As the Burma front entered a state of confrontation between the two armies before the rainy season, the enemy used the British 76th Division to advance from the north, and a part of the 19th Division to advance from the west, and the entire unit invaded the mountainous plateau area. At present, the two armies are engaged in small-scale battles in that area. It is reported that before dawn on the 18th, the Japanese launched a strong attack on about 600 enemy soldiers in Laukshak (70 kilometers northeast of Meiktila) and its vicinity, and encircled and attacked the enemy army. The Japanese army's battle results included about 90 enemy corpses left behind, and destruction of five pursuit cannons, seven heavy and light machine guns, and many other military supplies. Under the cover of artillery, other units launched a surprise attack on the enemy army 40 kilometers north of Garo (50 kilometers east of Meiktila) at dawn on the 20th, causing them to collapse, abandoning 50 corpses. The Japanese army captured a large number of ammunition. In addition, other Japanese army units launched a mopping-up operation against a 200-bandit group 30 kilometers west of Po Pa (about 150 kilometers east of Meiktila), capturing 60 submachine guns and a large amount of ammunition. Also, the enemy army that invaded Garo has greatly reduced its combat power due to the Japanese army's counterattack, and is now gradually replacing it with the first-line troops.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Colombo, the Southeast Asian Military Headquarters announced on the 18th that the navy participating in the British army's landing operation in Yangon included the battleship Queen Elizabeth (36,000 tons), the French battleship Richelieu (35,000 tons), and the cruisers Saif Ceylon and Tromp, the destroyers Byan Paratrai, Lopak, Reuspaus, and Leto, as well as the Indian Navy's Sheelpo, Satlej, and Koari, and the British Navy's Felike, Tert, Loki, and Spey.</p>
<h3>Japanese Continue Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships off Okinawa</h3>
<p>Southwest Islands Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Air Force continues to launch fierce attacks on enemy naval forces in the southwest islands. On the night of the 18th, an aerial torpedo attack on an enemy special aircraft carrier in the Okinawa Sea caused a major fire. A cruiser or destroyer and a large transport ship were also torpedoed, causing great damage. Another unit dropped large bombs on an enemy transport ship and a destroyer, destroying them. Also, from late at night on the 18th to dawn on the 19th, an air raid on Ie Island airfield caused fires in several places, and continued to attack the northern airport on Okinawa Island and nearby facilities, causing fires in several places.</p>
<h3>Tarakan War Situation Gradually Becomes Fierce</h3>
<p>Southwest Area Base, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The land battle on Tarakan Island, which has been in a stalemate since the 11th, has become increasingly tense since the enemy began preparing to attack. Since the 16th, the enemy has carried out naval bombardment on the eastern coast of Amar, attempting to land. At the same time, the enemy forces launched a general attack east of the airfield with artillery and naval gun cover, engaging in a battle for control with the Japanese garrison. The current line of confrontation between the two armies is from the north of the airfield, through the water purification plant, to the north side of the oil field area. The initial close combat since the enemy landed has gradually become fierce. The Japanese Commando Assault Team is becoming increasingly active, killing about 150 enemies, destroying three cargo trucks, three light machine guns, three barracks, and two material warehouses, killing a total of one-third of the enemy landing forces. Although the Japanese army is outnumbered, it still secures the main positions and crushes the enemy forces everywhere.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Strengthening Fire Protection Facilities</h3>
<p>Recently, fires have occurred repeatedly in this city. The scope and degree of damage have been relatively extensive. The fire on Yuyao Road not long ago, and the fire on Shanxi Road yesterday, are particularly disheartening!</p>
<p>Although the fire protection facilities in this city are relatively complete compared to other parts of the country, due to the dense population, the value of land, and the cramped living conditions of lower and middle-class families, any fire that occurs will inevitably involve and affect others. Therefore, fire protection facilities are already insufficient to meet actual needs in peacetime. Moreover, in wartime, enemy air raids and bombings are inevitable, and fire protection facilities must be especially strengthened.</p>
<p>Regarding strengthening fire protection facilities, in terms of the actual situation, some should be actively carried out mainly by the authorities, while others should be jointly undertaken by the authorities and the people, or prepared by the citizens themselves. Here are some of my observations for the attention and reference of all relevant parties.</p>
<p>In terms of what the authorities should pay attention to regarding fire protection facilities in the future, one is to raise regular light expenses, and to systematically improve and supplement public fire protection equipment; the second is to improve the service methods of fire department personnel during emergency periods, and to improve their treatment, and to determine reward and punishment methods. Those who have made special contributions should be rewarded with honor and material rewards. Those who are ineffective in their service or even have immoral behavior must be publicly and severely punished, in order to ensure that rewards and punishments are clear. The third is to establish a supervisory agency to assume the supreme supervisory responsibility for fire protection facilities and fire protection work during wartime, in order to unify and strengthen the city's fire protection work. And to implement rigorous training for firefighters.</p>
<p>In terms of what the authorities and the public should jointly promote, the first is to organize a fire protection design committee for emergency periods (assuming), composed of official representatives and civilian leaders, to combine the strength of officials and the public to carry out investigations, research, and design work related to fire protection in the city. The agency will be responsible for guiding and promoting fire protection work initiated and guided by the authorities that requires money and effort from the public. It is hoped that the city's Baojia organization can play a leading role in this regard, using the Baojia mechanism as a powerful auxiliary to the city's fire protection work in the future. Cooperation between the public opinion circles and the relevant authorities goes without saying.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the future, the city's fire protection work will be directly related to the lives and property of citizens, and must be carried out with the automatic cooperation of citizens. The most urgent tasks today are: First, to universally dig wells and springs, so that when the tap water source is interrupted, well water can be used, so as not to panic at the last minute. Second, those who cannot afford to purchase fire extinguishers must prepare adequate fire-fighting sand and water storage in each household for use when necessary. Third, the necessary items for saving lives and treating injuries must also be adequately prepared, especially first aid medicines, which should be purchased as soon as possible within their means. The above three items are especially needed in the most crowded places, and it is hoped that the Baojia and knowledgeable people in the neighborhood will do their best to advise them.</p>
<p>Although the city has held many air defense exercises, citizens may still not be familiar with fire protection work during air defense periods, and may still panic in the event of an emergency. Therefore, we believe that more fire drills should be held in the future to enable citizens to fully understand how to avoid hindering the work of firefighters when an accident occurs, and to further understand how to assist firefighters in rescue work.</p>
<p>Fire protection facilities should be strengthened first in factory areas, bustling city areas, and poor people's living areas. Praise factories, shops, and houses with complete fire protection equipment to allow nearby residents to observe and emulate. Citizens and Baojia personnel who have contributed to cooperative fire protection should be adequately rewarded. It is firmly believed that if we can work hard along these lines, strengthen fire protection facilities, and increase fire protection power, it will not be difficult to make the city a model fire protection city and reduce the damage caused by fires.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Dongtai County</h3>
<p>— Huang E</p>
<p>Geographical Evolution</p>
<p>Dongtai County is located on the Fan Gong embankment, a thoroughfare for north-south travel. It belongs to Taizhou. It was separated and established as a county in the 43rd year of the Qianlong reign (Qing Dynasty). The Fan Gong embankment stretches from Nantong in the south to Gaoyou in the north, traversing the counties of Rugao, Dongtai, and Yancheng. It was built by Fan Zhongyan during the Song dynasty, originally to prevent seawater intrusion. Now, the sea has receded eastward, and the area east of the Fan embankment is more than a hundred *li* from the sea, finally bordering the coast. As a result, what were once just thatched huts and barren land for salt production are now mostly fields for planting beans, cotton, and corn. The transformation from sea to land, the shifting of valleys, is truly remarkable. West of the Fan embankment,</p>
<p>rivers and harbors crisscross, and ditches and canals are wide and interconnected, mostly fed by the waters of Huai and Hongze Lakes discharged from the canal. This is the so-called "Li-xia River" area, where irrigation is convenient, the soil is fertile, and production is abundant, long known as a land of fish and rice. Before the war, Dongtai County, apart from suffering from the major floods caused by the breach of the canal in the 10th and 20th years of the Republic of China, only experienced minor disturbances when Sun Chuanfang's defeated troops retreated north across the Yangtze River, with some looting by the disorderly soldiers. Otherwise, the city gates remained secure, and the capital was undisturbed. Although the historical Taiping Rebellion occurred, it did not affect the area. The people were prosperous, lived happily and contentedly, and officials serving in this area were said to be in "Golden Rugao, Silver Dongtai." The simplicity and timidity of the people's character can be seen here!</p>
<p>Public Security Situation</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Battle of Shanghai started the war. In March of the following year, the war spread to northern Jiangsu, and Yancheng was occupied. As a result, order in various counties collapsed. Vagrants rose up, seized civilian firearms, and levied exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. The suffering of the people was endured in silence. However, after 1940, the New Fourth Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced northward from Jingjiang, Taixian, and Jiangyan. They first encountered and fought with the Fourth Security Brigade under He Keqian. He's troops retreated without resistance. Thereupon, the Nationalist government dispatched over 20,000 troops, led by the 89th Army Commander Li Shouwei, to encircle and suppress the New Fourth Army. In the Battle of Huangqiao, the entire army was wiped out, and Li Shouwei also died in action. After this battle, the New Fourth Army gained great momentum and advanced victoriously, capturing the three counties of Dongtai, Jianhu, and Dafeng. At that time, Huai'an and Huaiyin had already been captured by the Japanese army advancing south from Xuzhou. The Nationalist provincial government first moved to Dongtai, then to Xinghua, confined to a corner, extremely embarrassed, and unable to maintain the remaining situation.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1941, the Japanese army again attacked Dongtai and Jianhu from Tongzhou and Rugao, reopening the Grand Canal and occupying Gaoyou, and besieged Xinghua. At the same time, Li Changjiang, Deputy Commander of the Guerrilla Forces in the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Region, stationed troops in Taizhou and led his troops to participate in the "peaceful cooperation," thus expanding the "peaceful area." The New Fourth Army and the Nationalist government had no choice but to abandon transportation hubs and retreat to the countryside, and the rural people suffered greatly from the disturbances. Even remote areas could hardly escape misfortune. Dongtai County, bordering Yancheng to the north, Rugao to the south, and Xinghua to the west, was a vital transportation hub for all counties in northern Jiangsu, and naturally became a strategic point contested by military strategists. Moreover, during the period when the Nationalist provincial government moved to Dongtai, it was repeatedly bombed, resulting in collapsed walls and debris, and numerous deaths and injuries. Although the disaster was second to Yancheng, the severity of the suffering was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Heavy Taxes</p>
<p>Currently, important towns and areas along the land and water transportation lines in Dongtai County are under the control of the "peaceful area," within the reach of military and political power. West of the Fan embankment, a small number of Nationalist troops are stationed in three or four villages, while the rest is the active area of the New Fourth Army, covering a very wide area. Therefore, the people bear a very heavy burden, some having to pay to three sides, and some to two sides, depending on the area in which they live. As for the methods of collecting donations and taxes, for the general public, the Baojia system is used, with layers of control, and monthly levies are distributed among households. For those without property, monthly taxes are levied per *mu* (unit of land). For general industrial and commercial operators, the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations are used to distribute quotas proportionally among businesses, so that no one can escape. Suppose someone lives in Town A, but their department store and silk business are both located in Town B, and their farmland is located in Village C in the "peaceful area," and also in Village D or Village E within the range of the New Fourth Army and the Nationalist government, then, in addition to paying business tax, consumption tax, consolidated tax, income tax, etc., they must pay household donations monthly in Town A, donations levied by the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations monthly in Town B, military provisions and military grass monthly in Village C, public grain and land tax in Village D, and comply with the regulations of rent reduction of two-fifths and winter reduction, and in Village E, they must pay all the donations levied by the "Old Central." Under such circumstances, what kind of burden do the people bear? Moreover, donations and taxes increase month by month, without end, so merchants complain in the market, and farmers complain in the fields, with a great sense of not knowing "when their lives will end." Here is a list of the donations that the Anfeng Town in the Second District of Dongtai County was supposed to pay in April, to give a glimpse:</p>
<p>2,000 *shi* of military rice (to supply the ×th Front Army).</p>
<p>400 *shi* of military rice (to supply the garrison troops).</p>
<p>39 *shi* and 3 *dou* of military rice (to supply the Dongtai County Security Team).</p>
<p>131 *shi* of military grass (to supply the Dongtai County Security Team).</p>
<p>100,000 yuan for vegetable allowance (to supply the Dongtai County Security Team).</p>
<p>One pillbox.</p>
<p>Two underground bunkers.</p>
<p>105 *zhang* of city wall construction.</p>
<p>The above three items are related to the Dongtai city defense works, and are distributed according to the area for raising funds, with labor, materials, bricks and tiles, and forced civilian labor for construction.</p>
<p>Considering the current grain prices in Dongtai, the above figures are also quite substantial. For example, rice costs 27,000 yuan per *shi*, polished rice costs 50,000 yuan per *shi*, and grass costs 2,700 yuan per *dan*. How can the people, who have survived the war, bear this heavy burden? Such "draining the pond to catch all the fish" does not seem to be the way to govern the people. It is said that when the ×th Division was stationed in Dongtai last autumn, activities to "invite wealth" were rampant, with kidnapping and extortion, open negotiations, without any scruples! At that time, more than 10,000 people with some assets fled to Taizhou to avoid disaster! It was not until the unit was transferred to western Zhejiang and the 25th Division took over the defense of Dongtai that the refugees gradually returned home.</p>

<h3>France harbors ambitions for the Saar</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news received here: Walls in various train stations in Paris are covered with slogans saying "When France becomes stronger again, the Saar must belong to France."

<h3>Alexander Criticizes Tito's Army Actions</h3>

Our fighting so far is also nothing more than thinking of preventing this kind of action of solving various problems with force at every turn. Our consistent policy is that so-called changes in territorial distribution must be implemented only after detailed discussions and heavy consultations between governments. However, at present, General Tito intends to use force and military occupation to establish his proposal, so in order to prevent this unreasonable act, we must fight again," and so on.</p>

The United States has appointed Appellate Court Judge Jackson as the prosecutor, and hopes that the three countries of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France will appoint prosecutors as soon as possible. The International Tribunal mentioned in the statement is not the same as the War Crimes Committee currently located in London. The President's Press Relations Secretary explained that "The War Crimes Committee is a jury system that accuses suspects. The International Tribunal in the current organization is dedicated to trying major criminals.</p>
<h3>Lebanon, The Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Cairo: Political circles in Cairo are increasingly uneasy in view of the abnormal developments in politics in the countries of the Levant, especially Lebanon. Unconfirmed reports from Damascus say that the situation in Lebanon is becoming more and more serious. Fortunately, French Minister Plenipotentiary General Bénet has arrived in the area, causing the crisis not to explode immediately. When the pro-French faction demonstrated on Victory Day, they forcibly tore the Lebanese flag, and shouted the slogan "Greater Lebanon of Tegor." At the same time, there were also anti-French elements taking the same action. Lebanese citizens in Egypt claimed that the French troops who arrived in their country included most of the senior officers who arrived by plane, and this news could not be confirmed for a while. However, the fact that France would send a cruiser to carry General Bénet and his party to Lebanon in order to recall the French troops stationed there, and soon another cruiser carrying a large number of French reinforcements, is undeniable.</p>
<h3>British Mediation Ultimately Has Little Effect</h3>
<p>The United Kingdom will do its best to mediate this dispute, but France is still increasing its garrison as before. At present, all sectors deeply hope that the British and Egyptian authorities in Cairo can immediately show good strategies, so that the dispute between France and Lebanon can be resolved. At the same time, Egypt, standing in the position of leader of the Arab League, is also eager to find a way to end this dispute as soon as possible, so that the countries of the Levant can make every effort to establish an effective alliance.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Rice-Producing Area Agricultural Loan Syndicate Established</h3>
<p>The 14th meeting of the Municipal Consultative Committee passed a proposal to organize an agricultural loan syndicate in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, and a subcommittee was set up to be responsible for promoting it. Secretary-General Luo, Li Sihao, Tang Hanzhi, Zhu Chuanquan, Jin Xiongbo, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Binhe, Ye Fuxiao, and Xu Jianping were appointed as members of the committee. The subcommittee convened meetings twice on April 23 and May 2 to discuss specific measures for organizing the agricultural loan syndicate, which was jointly organized by fifteen banks including China, Jiaotong, Huaxing, and Fuxing. The association held a tea party at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 20th) at No. 2 Albert Road, inviting responsible persons from various banks participating in the syndicate to discuss implementation measures. Secretary-General Luo, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Fudeng, Ye Fuxiao, Liu Ruxiang, Shen Erchang, Shen Jiufen, Xu Jianping, Xiang Shuxiang, Zhu Qingzeng, Huang Yuyi (representing Shen Changming), Tang Hanzhi (representing Liang Dingshu), Li Zuji, Chen Duoru, Zhu Rutang, Zhang Weiru, Zhang Zhuyu, Zhu Boquan, Sun Yaodong, Qian Dagai, Jin Xiongbo, Liang Zhongyi (representing Li Zuji), and Chen Binhe attended, with Secretary-General Luo presiding.

The loan disbursement work was decided to be fully entrusted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The realization of the agricultural loan is expected, which will help increase food production and benefit the food prospects of the city's citizens, which is worthy of anticipation, and the local social leaders, especially the leaders of the financial community, are keen to promote it, which is especially gratifying.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Public Places, Police Bureau Stipulates That Officers Should Show Identification Cards</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Sub-Bureau of this city has discovered that recently there have been unscrupulous people wearing uniforms and impersonating police officers who have secretly gone to various hotels under the guise of inspections to privately extort money. If this is not stopped, not only will the people suffer damage, but it will also affect the credibility of the police bureau. It has been found that the same thing has happened in other entertainment places, so the sub-bureau has stipulated measures that, in the future, if any official or policeman goes to inspect, regardless of whether they are wearing a uniform or not, they should first turn in their identification card and hand it over to the business owners for review and registration before carrying out the work in turn. Otherwise, the business owners should immediately refuse the inspection and report it to the sub-bureau at any time, and send police to investigate. This will protect the business community and maintain order.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Office Hours from Today</h3>
<p>The office hours of the City Police Bureau will be adjusted from today (22nd) to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM, and the order has been issued to the subordinate departments to comply with it.</p>

<h3>The Second Phase of Gold Certificates Will Be Issued Today, the Gold Certificate Market May Open Next Month</h3>
<p>The first phase of the Central Reserve Bank's gold certificates was sold on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, with good results. The second phase of issuance is scheduled to start today (the 21st) and end on the 23rd. The listed price of gold certificates is set at 830,000 yuan per tael, and it is expected that buyers will be even more enthusiastic than in the first phase. Regarding the gold certificate market, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange is actively preparing it. The market is arranged on the eighth floor of the stock exchange, and speakerphones are being installed. All preparations are expected to be completed this month, and trading can begin in early June. There will be about 40 to 50 market brokers, and their applications for participation in brokerage have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve System's Finances Are Gradually Loosening, Last Week Rice Prices Rose Sharply</h3>
<p>The financial situation in Shanghai in the past week has not undergone drastic changes, although international turbulence continued to evolve. The issuance of Central Reserve gold certificates has shown a good trend, shrinking currency and suppressing prices, and has achieved initial results, so people's hearts are increasingly stable. The black market is quiet and calm, and speculators want to move, but the result is that there is no opportunity to take advantage of, so only on Wednesday and Thursday the price tended to rise slightly, and on Friday it returned to its original state, and the transaction was extremely leisurely. Public bonds and silver ingots were stable and did not move, and Chinese stocks fluctuated slightly, mostly because the bulls insisted on not lowering the price, so the footing was quite stable. The Central Reserve Bank was very enthusiastic about stabilizing financial transfers, so the financial conditions were relaxed last week, and the phenomenon of lack of cash gradually decreased. The payment of cash by various banks and companies to depositors has increased compared with the past, and the discount exchange rate has disappeared.</p>
<p>As for industry and commerce, there seemed to be a turning point in the past week, and factories were preparing to start work and resume production. With the efforts of the authorities, the difficulties in raw materials and electricity seemed to be resolved. However, due to the stimulation of rumors from all sides, speculators took the opportunity to hoard goods, causing prices to rise. In particular, the prices of rice, grains, oil, sugar, and fuel, which are major commodities, suddenly rose sharply, causing social and livelihood unrest. Although the main reason is that the source is gradually scarce during the transition period between the old and new crops, the speculation of merchants taking the opportunity to hoard and manipulate market prices is the greatest influence in driving up prices. The general public hopes that the economic authorities will further investigate the situation thoroughly to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Police Bureau Cracks Down on Counterfeit Currency Organization</h3>
<p>Since the new director, Lu Peijie, took office in the Baoshan County Police Bureau, the police affairs have been completely renovated. Recently, counterfeit currency was found in the territory, and the detective team was ordered to secretly investigate. As a result, Song Guisheng was captured in Dushun Township, and more than 90,000 yuan of counterfeit currency was found. According to his confession, A Da was captured separately at No. 15 Hengmao Li, Ningxia Road, Shanghai, and a stone printing machine for privately printing counterfeit currency was found at No. 7 Mingde Li, Jinling Road. Zhou Zhongshan, Cao Yin die, and Cao A Si, three accomplices, were arrested at No. 34 Puyu Li, Penglai Road, and taken to the Shanshan Police Bureau for interrogation. They all confessed to privately printing counterfeit currency. All the witnesses were transferred to the government of the Shanshan County Government, which also handles judicial affairs. Director Lu arrived for less than a month before he first solved this major case.</p>
<h3>Huashan and Changning Districts Open Baojia Clerk Training Class</h3>
<p>The Huashan and Changning districts’ Baojia clerk training class held its opening ceremony yesterday (the 20th) at 10:00 AM at St. John's University. More than 150 trainees participated. Director Gu of the Baojia Office, Deputy Director Shi of the Baojia Office's Western District Office, Director Yao of the Changning Road Sub-Bureau, Director Guo Ruiquan representing the Huashan Road Sub-Bureau Director, as well as the Baojia Committee Chairmen of the two districts, Chief Joint Bao Chiefs Shen Siliang, Zhou Mengbai, Dai Ailu, Le Fenglin, and Cao Bin were all in attendance. First, Chairman Xue Hongkun reported on the preparatory work and the training class's planned hopes and other deceptions. Next, Director Yuan of the Baojia Office gave a speech, stating that Baojia personnel should be selfless, possess a spirit of service to work for the local area, and use the power of unity and mutual assistance to overcome all difficulties, eliminate malpractices, and enthusiastically guide the public, so that the Baojia can achieve good results. He then went on to describe the establishment of Baojia personnel at all levels, which has implemented an election system. This is the embryo of the people exercising their four powers, and Baojia personnel should do their best to guide it as a prelude to self-governance, and so on. Next, Director Yao, Director Pang (represented by Director Guo), Chief Joint Bao Chief Zhou, and Ye De of the fourth section of the Changning Road Sub-Bureau all gave speeches of encouragement. The ceremony concluded at 12:30 PM. It is reported that formal classes will begin today.</p>
<h3>Planting Coarse Grains is Popular in Shanghai's Suburbs</h3>
<p>According to a recent survey by agricultural authorities, the crops in the four suburbs of the city used to focus on rice cultivation, but this spring, most farmers, due to the heavy losses suffered from pests in the four suburbs last year, and the great destruction of the harvest, coupled with the high price of rice, which has led to a rise in the price of coarse grains, and the fact that the cost is low and the profit is high, have increased the amount of coarse grains planted in the four suburbs this spring by more than double compared to previous years.</p>
<h3>High Property Prices, Still Many Competing to Buy</h3>
<p>The city's real estate business is not gradually decreasing due to high prices and chaotic market prices. On the contrary, the number of people in the industry and outsiders competing to buy is higher than before. Therefore, the number of times the land price has risen in the city center and the urban area is alarming. The land price survey of the city in 1938 and May of 1944 and 1945 is listed on the left:</p>
<p>The first item is the price in March of 1938, the second item is the price in December of 1944, and the third item is the price in May of 1945.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road: 300,000 yuan, 40 million yuan, 200 million yuan. Dashanghai Road: 150,000 yuan, 22 million yuan, 120 million yuan. Datong Road: 40,000 yuan, 12 million yuan, 50 million yuan. Xishan Road: 34,000 yuan, 14 million yuan, 70 million yuan. Hengshan Road: 20,000 yuan, 10 million yuan, 70 million yuan. Yuyuan Road: 20,000 yuan, 4.5 million yuan, 18 million yuan.

Minguo Road: 25,000 yuan, 8 million yuan, 35 million yuan. Zhonghua Road: 15,000 yuan, 4.5 million yuan, 17 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Calligraphy by Pioneers of Asian Revival Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Calligraphy by pioneers of Asian revival is related to the revolutionary deeds between China and Japan and has historical value. The Shanghai branch of the China News Association held an exhibition at the Rihua Club on Xianyang Road yesterday (the 20th) at 10:00 AM to allow citizens to view the handwriting of the sages. People from all walks of life who came to visit were very enthusiastic. More than 100 pieces of calligraphy by Chinese and Japanese sages were displayed, including Sun Yat-sen's handwriting presented to Japanese Junzaburo Yamada: "Sailing in the Same Boat" and "The World is for All," which contains the spirit of Pan-Asianism. The verses given by martyr Chen Qimei to Yamada, "Not afraid of death, not stealing life, a man's great integrity shines with the sun, the way of compromise, not afraid of cauldron cooking, Ran Ran Alone, Miles Afraid of Emptiness," are enough to see Chen's broad-mindedness and abundant spirit, warmed in words. There is also a couplet given by Hu Hanmin to Yamada, "Non-heroic undertakings are humanitarianism," which also shows Hu's revolutionary spirit. Yamada's four characters "Supreme Sincerity Consistent" are full of vigor, but their meaning is actually better than the characters. Other relics, such as those of Wen Tianxiang, Lin Zexu, Huang Xing, and Zhang Yipeng, and the handwriting of the allied general Senjuro Hayashi are truly treasures. Today (the 21st) is the last day, and citizens are welcome to visit to avoid regrets.</p>

Zhang Baozhi, Liu Hesheng, Deng Xiaoliang, and Zhu Weigong attended, and Zhou Jiaqi, the secretary-general of the Municipal Sports Association, was specially invited to provide guidance.

<h3>Survey of the Rickshaw Industry in this City</h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>The rickshaw in Shanghai has a history of more than 40 years. It was originally called a "Japanese-style cart" because it was modeled after the Japanese style. At that time, the wheels were made of wood and foreign iron rings. Later, it was gradually improved and gradually became the form it is today.</p>
<p>The current distribution of rickshaws in Shanghai is as follows: There are a total of 10,163 vehicles and 1,055 rickshaw companies in the former one to eight districts. The remaining districts of Hubi, Nanshi, Xucao, Huxi, and Pudong have a total of 8,451 vehicles and a total of 1,940 rickshaw companies. There are more than 50,000 rickshaw pullers who are registered and licensed, and another 40,000 to 50,000 who are not registered. Most of them are from Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, Gaoyou, Taixian, Taixing and other places in northern Jiangsu, and a small number are from Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, Huaiyin, and Ying other places.</p>
<p>Before the war, most of the events were held in Hongkou, Zhabei, and the French Concession. After the war, they all moved to the French Concession, Huxi, and north of the Suzhou River. More than ten years ago, there were two rickshaw companies in Shanghai, Nanhe Company and Feixing Company, each with thousands of vehicles. Later, they were all sold. Now, well-known people from northern Jiangsu such as Gu Zhuxuan and Jin Jiulin also own a lot of vehicles.</p>
<p>Calculation of Rickshaw Rent</p>
<p>Rickshaw rent is the focus of the current labor-capital dispute. The principals calculate the rickshaw rent entirely based on the new price, but in reality, the vehicles they rent out are less than 30% new and are almost completely dilapidated. According to the union's calculations, the monthly cost of each vehicle includes: maintenance, painting, iron and wood repair, accident repair, body loss, wages and workshop, contractor's remuneration, license fee, union fee, mutual aid fee, accommodation fee, sundries, interest (official interest), etc., amounting to 105,669 yuan. This means that the average minimum daily expenditure per vehicle is 3,913 yuan. Now, according to the black market price, the daily rickshaw rent is 1,200 yuan, which is 32,400 yuan for 27 days. This seems to be a loss, but because of the difference between new and old goods, this calculation is of course very unreasonable. It is impossible to see profit or loss. It is said that according to past practice, the rickshaw rent must be agreed upon by representatives of both labor and capital before it can be implemented. Even if the capital side obtains the permission of the competent authority, it will not take effect.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Life</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers pull carts in the morning, evening, and night shifts. Because of limited physical strength, the morning shift is pulled for about 20 days a month, and the evening shift can only be pulled for 15 days a month. On average, they can pull 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per day. After paying the rickshaw rent of 1,200 yuan, eating at a food stall or buying sesame cakes for 1,500 yuan, and lamp oil costs of 200 yuan, and straw sandal costs of 200 yuan, it is very difficult to support a family with the remaining amount.</p>
<p>The most oppressed rickshaw pullers used to be the patrolmen who pried open their licenses at will and beat them arbitrarily. The French police also forced Chinese police officers to pay a certain number of licenses per month. This situation no longer exists after the recovery of the concession. However, they are still punished for not turning on the lights at night or for having lights that do not meet air defense regulations.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers are a type of coolie, and their lives are poorer than workers in any other sector. They wear old shirts and pants, which are patched again and again, or are torn in one place and hanging in another. Some are even unable to cover their bodies. In winter, the broken frames of their cotton clothes are exposed in pieces. They rarely buy a new piece of clothing in ten or eight years.</p>
<p>If they are single, they can barely manage to drink two bowls of porridge. If they have a wife and children, a family of four or five can only eat cornmeal, red beans, millet, and other coarse grains every day to get by, plus firewood and vegetable peelings, dried radish, salted fish, and other side dishes, which cost at least 3,000 yuan a day to eat. So, working one day is not enough to eat for one day.</p>
<p>About 30,000 rickshaw pullers do not have families, and they all live in rickshaw companies. The contractors build two or three-story lofts for the rickshaw pullers to live in. On the two-story lofts of each rickshaw company, 20 to 30 people live. In a three-story loft, 40 to 50 people squeeze in. They are arranged one by one in dirty cotton piles on the floor. The air is very dirty and smelly. Bedbugs and white ants surround them all day long. The floor is damp and filthy.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 rickshaw pullers live in shacks. They pay a low rent (or no rent) on empty land along the roads built beyond the French Concession in Huxi and build simple shacks. Hundreds and thousands of families are connected to each other. Now, it costs more than 200,000 yuan to build one. These shacks are most afraid of fire. A few days ago, more than 3,000 shacks were burned down on Singapore Road. There are really few who can afford to build new houses.</p>
<p>Water shortages are also what shack dwellers feel the most. Although some tap heads on the streets are open for two hours every morning, there are too many people. To fetch one or two buckets of water, you always have to walk a considerable distance and wait in line for a long time. Some shantytowns also dig wells, but they are actually just mud pits, but because the cost is low, the materials are saved, and the handlers want to take a cut, the wells are very shallow and the water quality is dirty and smelly and cannot be used as drinking water.</p>
<p>There are also some rickshaw pullers with families who live in rented houses in Huxi, beyond the French Concession, Dapuqiao, the end of Caishi Road, Lujiawan, and Xiejiao. Thirty to forty families live in one small house.</p>
<p>The general cultural level of rickshaw pullers is quite low. Eight out of ten are illiterate, and very few can read newspapers. They do not understand much about society and politics, and only know a little based on their own life experiences and people's oral accounts. Now, there are also some people with higher education who have changed careers to become rickshaw pullers. Most of these are temporary, because the income in this industry is, after all, more than that of teachers. Rickshaw pullers do not have any entertainment. Most of them play cards, pai gow, and mahjong for recreation. In addition, they go to teahouses to drink tea and listen to stories, or watch Jiangbei local operas.</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Organizations</p>
<p>The mobilization of collective work by rickshaw pullers sprouted in 1927. After the Northern Expeditionary Army recovered Shanghai, someone organized a labor union. After its establishment, more than 300 rickshaw pullers participated. The union's facilities included a tea room, a bathroom, relief work, and literacy education. Members paid a monthly membership fee of 3 jiao.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1933, rickshaw pullers He Wushan, Xu Zhulin, Zhu Fengxiang, and Cang Gongwen in the Public Concession initiated the organization of a rickshaw puller relief association and obtained permission from the Public Works Bureau to establish it. They requested that the daily rickshaw rent be reduced from 1 jiao 3 fen to 1 jiao, and another 1 jiao be paid for the relief association's expenses. However, the Public Works Bureau also announced the establishment of the "Rickshaw Puller Mutual Aid Association" and stipulated that the rickshaw rent at that time was 8 jiao 5 fen, with 5 fen used for the mutual aid association's expenses. Now the mutual aid fee has risen to 600 yuan per month and is collected together with the vehicle tax. The Mutual Aid Association has twelve directors. In addition to the directors, there is also a custody committee, which is currently managed by Ji Wu.</p>
<p>The Mutual Aid Association has three departments: the Education Department, the Relief Department, and the Investigation Department. It handles education for rickshaw pullers' children, free medical care and midwifery, etc. In terms of relief: a funeral allowance of 20,000 yuan for the death of a rickshaw puller, a family pension of 20,000 yuan, a disability relief fund ranging from 50,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan, a small business capital of 10,000 yuan for changing careers, and a relief fund of 20,000 yuan for the death of a rickshaw puller's family member. Assistance funds for returning home (Yancheng, Funing, Gaoyou, Huai'an: 15,000 yuan. Nantong, Qichong, Rugao, Taizhou: 10,000 yuan. 5,000 yuan per family member). Fire and housing relief fund of 2,500 yuan.</p>
<p>On March 1, 1934, the Public Works Bureau, in order to limit the number of rickshaw pullers and plan to gradually eliminate vehicles, stipulated that 40,000 rickshaw pullers must register and be photographed at the Vehicle Affairs Office. Rickshaw pullers can only pull carts after obtaining a license. The current rickshaw puller registration is from May 1st to July 31st, and each card costs 300 yuan. The location is the Vehicle Affairs Office on Changxing Road, but the general rickshaw pullers are completely unaware of how to register and where to obtain a certificate. They often run four or five times, and it often takes several days to get a license!</p>

<h3>Extortion by Coarse Grain Merchants, Please Pay Attention to by the Authorities</h3>
<p>There was originally a coarse grain market at No. 15 Edward Road in this city. After it was closed midway, merchants were not allowed to gather there without permission from the authorities. However, if retail merchants needed coarse grains and had no way to inquire, they would be accosted and interrogated in the vicinity of Caishi Street by two or three people impersonating detectives, dressed in Chinese and Western clothes, who would check passersby in that section of the road. If they saw someone with a coarse grain business residence permit, they would be dragged into a small alley to threaten and extort them. This has become commonplace. The industry has suffered a lot, so it is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention. I previously submitted a request to the municipal government to restore the original market in order to balance supply and demand and avoid corruption. All grain merchants in the industry hope for early approval. (Xing Zhigang)</p>
