<h3>沖繩島戰况益趨激烈　敵艦船損失空前　擊沉擊毀累計達一七七艘</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日大本營三日下午三時發表：　沖繩本島之日軍守備部隊，於敵登陸地點附近，現仍繼續果敢實行邀擎戰中。　日航空部隊繼續猛攻本昂周邊之敵方艦船，其後判明之戰果如次：擊沉特政航空母艦一艘。戰艦一艘。戰艦或輪送船一艘·巡洋艦六艘·驅逐艦一艘·輸送船一艘·艦型不詳者二艘。擊毀特設航空母艦一艘·包括戰艦之大型艦船十一輛·戰艦或巡洋艦一艘·巡洋艦二艘·巡洋艦或輸送船一艘·蝓送船二艘。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日機隊與水上部隊，對冲韆本鳥從事登陸作戰之美機動部隊加以猛攻，茲據三日日大本營發表業己判明之戰果，計艦船擊沉十三艘，擊毀十八艘，累計擊沉九十六艘，擊沉或擊毀九艘，擊毀七十二艘，總計己達一百七十七艘。根據敵力情報，可知沖繼島周邊之敵艦船約有一千四百艘，而日方迨今已擊沉或擊毀其百分之十三。</p>
<h3>日軍勇猛作戰決定戰局歸趨</h3>
<p>又訊　冲繩島戰况逐漸激烈，美軍依靠物量進行作戰，日軍航空及水上部隊誓死抵抗，兩軍戰鬥，可謂決定太平洋戰局之歸趨，頗堪注目。美軍豪稱在該方面動員之軍艦船舶共述一千四百艘，然日軍每日擊沉繫傷其數十艘，使美軍瞻寒。按美國聲稱一千四百艘之艦船，乃聯合國所能動員之最大限度，其中包含一切大小登陸用舟艇及後方之補給用艦船等。其能在前綫從事作戰者，不過三分之一而己。日軍連日對於大型艦船之戰果，（參閱後表）已達美海軍之過半，因此將來美軍或被迫變更其作戰方針，亦未可知。硫黃島戰爭時，日軍隱忍自重，以待將來機會，今次冲繩烏戰事發生，日軍傾注全部戰力，以期打開目前戰局，連日由不期生還之特攻隊，不斷加以猛攻，其結果如何，即能決定大東亞將來之命運，頗爲國人關心。美軍雖然依賴其多量物質，然其戰略未必成功，而連日遭受大損失，更必招致挫折其戰意之一日。</p>
<p>美軍艦船損失統計</p>
<p>茲將日軍在沖繩海面予美軍之損失艦船統計如下：</p>
<p>「擊沉」航空母艦二艘·戰艦三艘·巡洋艦二十艘·巡洋艦或騙逐艦一艘·竊逐艦十四艘·掃海艇一艘。輸送船三艘。艦種不詳者二十一艘，大型軍艦五艘·登陸用輪送船十六艘·戰艦或輪送船一艘，共計八十八艘。</p>
<p>「擊沉或擊傷」航空母艦二艘。戰艦一艘，共計一三艘。</p>
<p>「擊傷」航空母艦艘·特設航空母艦一艘·戰艦三艘。戰艦或巡洋艦十一艘·巡洋艦四艘·驅逐艦十艘·輸送船十艘。艦種未詳者十三艘·大型軍艦十五艘。輪送船或航空母艦十一艘。巡洋艦或輸送船一艘，共計七十一艘·以上總計一六二艘</p>
<p>美軍集中英法義艦隊，作孤注一擲之作戰，幷稱爲世界最大之艦隊，然其損失亦屬世界戰史上最大之損失。航空母艦之損失計有八一艘，大型軍艦二十艘中，似有航空母艦數艘，其他戰艦被擊沉或擊傷者七艘，巡洋艦則達二十艘之多，此外尚有兵員損失五萬餘人，加之陸上戰鬥之損失，則美軍之所受損害，可謂空前未有</p>
<h3>B29型機襲東京　墜毀四十五架　敵機六架侵入瀨戶內海</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之B29型機約五十架，由二日晨二時起歷一小時半，在三四千公尺之高度，以一架或二架由相撲嚴附近侵入東京西部地區，投下照明彈，然後績投炸彈及燒夷彈，於某地上空復曾投下定時炸彈，然被審均甚輕微，重要設施及工塲幾無損害。日方制空部隊立即果敢邀擎，當擊落共十五架，擊傷約三十架。又一日下午九時至二日晨二時之問，B29機六架侵入瀨戶內海方面，一架使入山口縣境。</p>
<h3>日陸海特攻隊　施衝撞戰術　琉球近海戰果擴大中</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日軍陸海特攻隊於沖繩本島海面，迄二日下午爲止，所獲戰果如次：</p>
<p>神風特攻隊對於沖繩本島周邊及琉球羣島附近行動中之敵艦船，日軍神風特攻隊及海軍航空部隊繼續拼撞反覆猛攻，遂漸擴大戰果中。二十日夜至一日晨前後猛攻六次，敵方受劍甚重，三十日夜日海軍航空部隊進攻攻動於冲繩本島近海之敵運輸船隊，以直擊彈擊中油船或空母一艘，使之大破起火，此外尚擎沉登陸用舟艇一艘，　破區逐艦一艘。一日晨，神風特攻隊衝人琉球方面之敵艦船羣，另一神風特攻隊之一架，撞中敵大型運輸船一艘，即告沉沒，一架撞中戰艦一艘，使受重創，二架撞中運輪船二艘使之起火，此外並有二架向艦型不明之敵艦船二艘撞去。一日晨敵機動部隊曾出現於琉球軍計南端石坦島附近，神風特攻隊立即猛烈全機備入敵部隊，撞中敵空母一艘使之起火，另一隊則乘機加以反覆轟炸，使受甚大損害。</p>
<p>陸軍特攻隊運日猛攻冲繩周邊敵艦船羣之日陸軍特別攻擊隊，其後戰果徑判明如次：除廿九日夜業己發表者外，更擊破巡洋艦一艘，卅一日夜又追加繫破運輪船一艘，卅一日夜至一日晨，陸軍特攻隊八架衝入慶　間羣島西南方海面之敵艦船羣，擊破中型運輸船一艘，同時並判明起火及火柱四條，又是時慶良間羣島北方亦有艦型不明之敵艦一艘起火燃燒，此當為其他新銳特攻隊戰果之一部。一日上午四時五十分至軣時之間，在此方面復擊沉敵巡準艦二艘，五時五十分在沖繩本島南側　川南方海面擊沉艦種不　之敵艦二艘，七時許敵輸送船二艘因日特攻隊之撞擊發火燃燒，由陸上可以望見，八時廿五分該海中央擊破敵驅逐襤二艘，並使其發火燃燒，至十時許敵巡洋艦二艘起大火往而沉沒。自敵軍登陸該島以來，日軍空陸海三位一體共同猛攻敵登陸用輸送船，截至現在止，計擊沉其艦船十六艘，此外於廿六日晨攻擊慶良間列島附近敵空母羣所收戰果，除已發表者外，續查明繫沉（或擎破）空母一艘，此外並擊沉似由巡洋艦改建之大型空母一艘。</p>
<h3>襲粵敵機　擊墜毀二架</h3>
<p>廣州三日央社電　駐渝美空軍P51型機數架，二日下午五時左右來襲廣州地區，對該地區機塲及其他設施加以掃射，經日制空部隊邀擊結果，計擊落擊毀敵機各一架。</p>

<p>代論</p>
<h3>警察保甲化保甲警察化</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>——在保甲同人歡送五島處長席上致詞</p>
<p>今天本市保甲同人歡送五島處長，因爲五島處長榮轉要職，即將離滬，因此保甲同人藉以表示惜別之忱。木人以保甲職員之資格參與其盛，並乘便略設幾句，藉表敬意。</p>
<p>五島處長在本市警局擔任重要工作，爲時已久，平日處事的謹慎切實，向爲一般市民所欽佩，尤其對於保甲制度的確立與推進，頗多協力貢獻。</p>
<p>警察是公務人員，保甲是民問代表，警察與保甲的身份雖有不同，可是，爲地方治安服務的目票則一。</p>
<p>我們屢次提出過，警察是公務人員中最接近民間者。營察服務的動情，最易使民問發生直接觀　，民問對於政治的信仰，從　察的服務效率中取能收效，面保中人員則全以人民的身份參加服務，協助警察擔任治安工作，協助政府推行基層政令·所以，保甲人員更可以說促使警察與民間進一步聯繫的紐帶。</p>
<p>保甲制度確立以後，保甲人員的任務，不但促使警察與人民問的聯繫。同時，也促使人民本身之間的聯繫。誠如羅秘書長在還都紀念日民問慶祝會演詞中說：「上海市民因受英美百年來推行殖民政策的結果，養成重私利的習慣，有着「各描自己門前雪，不管人家瓦上霜」的自私能度，極少互助精神，雖同住一屋以內，而二樓與三樓住戶，見面不相往來。「自從有了保甲組織，共同担任公益服務，有了接觸認識的機會，發揮了相互協助的精神。因此，保甲人員在協助治安方面，如恐怖家件竊盜案件的減少，在協助政令方而，如市民對於防空常識的認識等等，均足以證明警察與保甲相輔相成的成效。</p>
<p>不過，從更廣大的任務而言，我們對於警察與保甲的本身任務，以至彼此之問的聯　，均有更進一步努力的必要。在周兼警察局長就職之始，對於　政的刷新，曾屢次的懇切表示，一方面提高警察的待過，以期如定生活，安心服務，一方面節縮機構，調整人事，以期增進效率。最近幾個月來，一般警察風紀之整飭，已徑收到初步成效，更可以證明不在於環境的艱難，而在於有否努力整頓的決心。至於保甲方面，在目前時局益　緊張階段，需要人民協力之處更多，而時局愈緊張，敵人的陰謀愈尖銳，因之謠言　語愈見層出不窮，怎樣辨別、謠言粉碎陰諜，使人民不受迷惑，我們保甲人員也應書相當的責任。</p>
<p>五島處長過去主特特着問處及經濟保安處，可以說都是警察的特務工作，我們知道特務工作是賦予特種職權的。一般的說，在運用特　職權之際，最易發生濫用的流弊。所以，擔任特務工作的人，最必要的條件，就是耍有道德，操守廉正的道德。換句話說，惟有最好道德的人，才能擔任特務工作。五烏先生就是具有最好道德，具有操守廉正道德的模範。我們希望警察特務人員都應以五島先生的服務道德爲模範。</p>
<p>其次，特務工作中主要的一項是情報，情報的來源，原是根據各方面的動態。可是，對於情報的內容，祈能作爲客觀上的參考，如須作爲事實處理，必先加以精密的判斷，然後決定是項情報的眞實性。所以擔任情報工作的人，必須具有豐富的常識，以及精細的判斷力。換句話說，惟有常識豐富的人，才能勝任情報工作。上面說過，目前時局下，上海的謠言言，屬出不　，保甲人員固須辨別，而一般情報工作人員更不能以謠言作爲情報炎料，過去因有不正確的情報，但已經減少了民聞許多的痛苦。現在五島先生雖將離任，我們希望其餘在職賭君，均以五島先生領重明辦的能度爲模區。不爲誰言情報所影響。</p>
<p>總之，無論一般警察取特務警察的任務。都以爲人民服務，使人民敬愛為唯一目標。而保甲人員的任務，也都以協助警察達成其任務爲目標。因此，必須促成警察保甲化，保甲警察化，使警察保甲與人民眞正打成一片，毫無間隔，敬以此意酬答五島先生過去的勞蹟，並以與警察保甲人員共勉。</p>
<h3>德淪陷人民　發起自由運動　抗戰決心仍未動搖</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　德問社訊：德國社黨自由運動，業已發起於東西兩綫被佔區內，其宣傅機關「威伏爾夫」廣播電台，於復　節屋期日向德人首次發表宜言，鄭重聲明德被佔區內之男女老幼，決心於敵之後方繼續作戰，使敵對德人所受之一切損失付出代價，以保目由光榮。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　海通社訊：反軸心軍渡萊茵河，向德國中心採取新攻勢之成功雖著，但德人抗戰決心仍未動搖。敵旣冒險深入德境，或由陸或由空運輸接濟必感困難，如坦責車需用之原料，其一端也。德軍將利用敵軍喘息時間，組織新防綫，企圖包開魯爾區之敵軍由南而進，抵索斯特（Soest）里普斯塔特（Lippstadt）市區，守軍仍力戰不已。</p>
<h3>英鐵甲車隊　深入德境　曼斯特城巷戰中</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　海通社訊：英鐵甲軍在曼斯特（Muenster）與哈姆（Hamm）之間衝過，現抵貝萊斐爾特（Bielefeld）迤南之著名吐托堡格森林，曼斯特城內有激戰。</p>
<h3>蘇聯巴西復交</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　海通社訊：巴西外長昨實布，巴西與蘇聯間成立外交關係，惟關於新公使人選並無提及。</p>
<h3>胡宗南軍兩師　移駐滇省</h3>
<p>廣州本日中央社電　所謂重慶西南反攻之軍事基礎，尙未完成，且諸般情勢亦均未成熟，現尙不過為實傳時期。據最近到達當地之情報稱：目下已將蔣直系精銳部隊胡宗南之第四十五師及第八師，配置於昆明之中國陸空軍總司令部，受總司令部之直接指揮，該軍現正向雲南中央部集結中。所以將此將介石之「虎之子」部隊駐留該地之目的，純係使駐屯於昆明。保山方面之地方部隊，直接受胡宗南之監督。同時為期整理統合廣西。四川。雲南各地方軍隊而使之中央化，特任命李宗仁爲漢中行營主任，此外，並將重慶衛戍司令劉峙派赴西南前綫之事實，其用意亦在於促使各地防衛軍之中央化。然此等盤據多年之地方重閥，並非是想像中之晚於屈服者也，故其西南總反攻之作戰準備，乃陷於遲遲不進之現狀。</p>
<h3>幻夢一般的　舊金山會議</h3>
<p>— 日大使館情報部長岸偉一</p>
<p>表決手續</p>
<p>關於理事會之表決手續，英　兩國主張以多數表決，蘇聯則主張須全體一致方作通過，結果至少當可邊到應有常務理事國之一致妥協辦法，但常務理事國之某一國家成爲紛爭當事國時之表決，蘇聯主張紛爭當車國參加表決，英美則主張不參加。</p>
<p>此問題在蘇聯爲一極重要之問題，問題之重要性，乃因國際聯合之性格而產生，同時重反映出英美對蘇聯內部之關係，在所謂「聯合國家　中，未與蘇聯成立外空關係之國家　共有二十國之多，此等國家均有反蘇傾向，此爲世人所稔知者。一方面英美之聯繫，如處理歐洲問題方案所明示，爲對蘇聯一種政治同盟之關係，是則將來三國問發生紛爭之時，（　此時己孕有許多發生可能性）例如歐洲之渡籣·希臘·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞等之處理問題，對近東及中東之土耳其等處理問題，及東亞之滿洲中國間題，以及英美　　南洋貨源問題，若非有蘇聯之監視，與實力阻止，將作最有利於英美二國之解決，極爲顯然。此時，無論用如何方法提出問題，所謂反軸心國之與論，均不利於蘇聯，蘇聯若諜講求保衛自己之方法，則將發生有戰事之處的事態，其時理事會旣成爲決定「侵略國家」定義之唯一機關，則遭受處分者，必為蘇聯，故蘇聯身為參加國際機構之一員，反而這受與現在反軸心國對德國同探之待遇，事屬必然　故蘇聯對於具有強人　力之理事會的運用，自應審　注意，避免未得自己同意，被依照「侵略」之曖味定義，指爲罪犯國。傳前次舉行之克里米亞會談，對於表決問題意見完全一致，若英美接受蘇聯之主張，則對英美蘇三大國間之紛爭，當然安全保障理事會不得子以千預，本制度將從根本上崩潰。</p>
<p>所謂侵略與反對侵略，幷非茶個國家內在之性質不斷發展之民族及國家一遭受阻止，其發展之法則打繫，則立即發化破壞作用。例如維也納會談之機構，於十餘年後而崩壤，凡爾賓體制亦於二十年後而崩潰，侵略與反侵略之概念，爲維持現狀國家認爲其實力支配可恃，對要求樊更現狀之少數國家採用「好戰國民一之多數票決之決議，好戰國被斷爲使略者，由此觀之，侵略係反侵略國家本身所誘發。</p>
<p>總之，侵略反侵略幷非由事態實地之概念，不外爲政策的且相對的概念，國家聯合以防止侵略爲第一目標，因此，彼等斷定以武力爲第一有效措置，彼等根本幷未檢討侵略所發生之世界情勢之實體，而謀應付，故戰爭將接運勃發，第二次大戰結束後，又將發生第三次大戰。</p>
<p>綜上所述，爲國際聯合未能貢獻維持世界和平之外表的及機構的缺陷，至舊金山會議其將以幻夢一般的會議而終的命運，更起因本質的問題，此種本質的問題，實爲吾人所最應當價重考書者，亦應以之爲批評之對象。蓋爲世界人類爲東亞民族，更爲夢想以此種機構獲得和平之反軸心國人民，吾人均非加以闡明不可，現在試就此問題加以討論。</p>
<p>國際聯合之本質上的缺陷</p>
<p>吾人對此問題作歷史的觀察時，有再度反省過去國際聯盟如何失敗之必要，原來國際聯盟所以不得不陷入窮途末路者，乃因有根本的缺陷存在，此並非理事會總會之權限，美國不參加等形式的機構的問題，若僅　眼聯盟失敗之原因，爲聯盟理事會軟弱無力，實施裁制條項，時感肘制，以及未能迅速採取有效措置等等，而不知其本質的缺陷，則無諭如何修正聯盟機構，依然爲空中樓閣。</p>
<p>聯盟本質的缺陷，第一爲其本身完全爲敵意之產物，因此之故，成爲了專門擁護凡爾賽攻條約之機關，當時英美法三國之企圖，主要爲如何使德國不能再起，如何使德團賠償損失，如何處罰德國等問題，他們妄以爲此種中心問題解決，世界和平便可期待，實爲倘覺之理論。蓋聯盟與戰爭結束後，再建設之世界和平機構之構想之間，幷無何種理論的區別，聯盟一而提倡建設人類和平，一面便因戰爭破壞而發生之事態成爲固定化，對於新世界之發展與文化之典隆，幷無何種可貢獻建設成之理想。</p>
<p>聯盟本質的缺陷，第二爲使其規約中所留之比較進步的條項，完全成爲有名無實，規約第十九條會規定「聯盟總會得隨時慫恿聯盟國再度審議不能適用之條約，或繼續結果可使世界和平陷於危殆之國際狀態」。此項規定極其曖味，蓋世界和平之基礎以現狀之固定化實難期待，毋寗固定化實使世界和平陷於危殆，故暗示實行審議此種國際狀態，擬作和平的樊更，然而此規定，一因關於究在何種理念之下，審哉國際狀態，幷未表明明確之指導理念，二因聯盟所由產生之　史性格，被完全漢視。</p>
<p>需時使現狀發生變化之國際問題，為德國之復興，義大利之自覺，以及認滿洲事變等爲一切侵略之威脅，而加以抑壓及內部之民族遝動之發展，更被導入最大之危機中。</p>
<p>吾人觀察安全保障理本會時，可知毫無反省，正如過去威爾遜歌頌十四條爲世界之福昔，結果却產生凡爾賽條約，今彼等又讚美大西洋　章，決定克里米亞會議，彼等最近曾在莫斯科。開羅。及德黑蘭舉行會議，麽次所欲保持之理理想，已經完全失敗，僅中世紀的思想忽告抬頭，以世界爲敵之怪物，已藉世界和平之美名而創造，預料近代的黑暗時代將再現於今日，支配彼等之思想爲締結以資本主義戰爭，爲特徵之榨取條約，而强行實施此種條約者，厥爲安全保障理事會。</p>
<p>其次，國際聯盟規約中由於良心發現而加入之「國際狀態之和平的變更」，此次開際聯合並未提及一言，彼等之企圖，顯在以國際武力維持現狀並視之與世界和平同爲一物，此項和平縱能於最短期間勉强維持，但因不能使民族向上，而無藝術文化之發展，因無藝術文化之發展，而無人類之進步，旣無人類之進步，安能求幸福與警宋，此非和平而係靜止及沈滯，目其壽命極短。蓋國際聯合所代表之民族及國家，除與國際聯合之意圖相同外，並不斷努力完成皂己工作，同時參加國際聯合之國家羣，除滿足於維持現狀之英美二國以外，大多數均不斷要求改變現狀，是以在政治經濟及文化方面壓制此稱進步的動向，實非集合的武力所能爲，集合的武力，亦即行解體，尤其第一次及第二次世界大戰具有展開民族的自覺及偷局一大運動之作用，故各兵族及國家，對於行將建設之世界秩序頗表歡迎，此稱傾向爲歷史所使然，且爲人類進化之正常進路，墨守第一次世界大戰後之思想，當然難以應付，其實國際縣合自始即不過爲相當悲慘命運之代替物而已。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜上所述，將於四月二十五日誇稱爲確立世界和平在舊金山召開之會議，不過爲戰爭之繼續而已。除强化戰爭手段以外，別無他物，人類所冀求之眞正和平與文化之創造，僅以超抵戰爭，始可實現，而超越戰爭云者，誠如胡兩成氏所指摘，爲各國客觀的深究因戰爭所發生之歷史的事實及歷更的進展，在此種基礎之上，各國展開本身之內部運動，分別以解決國內問題，而自行誘導解決國際問題，此事已由現氏戰爭爲總力戰，在民族總動員戰制下之事實，予以說明，一切民族旣參加戰爭，故不得不干預戰爭之解決，各國民族具有同一之目標，及共同之理念，此即爲對任何民族亦容許解決民族問題之世界秩序是也。換言之不外爲使萬邦各得其所，億兆各安其堵之理念，此種理念決非由任何絛約之條款所能履行，此已由事實之進展予以啓示·新世界秩序應適應此種運動之方向規定各國關係。舊金山會議已否認此種人類社會的運動法則之進展，而引起混亂與戰爭矣。</p>

<h3>The Battle of Okinawa Intensifies; Enemy Warship Losses Unprecedented; Total Sunk and Destroyed Reaches 177 Vessels</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 3rd: The Japanese garrison on Okinawa Island is still bravely engaging in interception battles near the enemy landing points. The Japanese Air Force continues to fiercely attack enemy warships around the island, and the subsequently confirmed battle results are as follows: sunk one special-purpose aircraft carrier, one battleship, one battleship or transport ship, six cruisers, one destroyer, one transport ship, and two ships of unknown type. Destroyed one special-purpose aircraft carrier, eleven large warships including battleships, one battleship or cruiser, two cruisers, one cruiser or transport ship, and two transport ships.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese air and naval units are fiercely attacking the American mobile force engaged in landing operations on Okinawa Island. According to the battle results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 3rd, a total of 13 enemy ships have been sunk and 18 destroyed, bringing the cumulative total to 96 sunk, 9 sunk or damaged, and 72 destroyed, for a grand total of 177 vessels. According to enemy intelligence, there are approximately 1,400 enemy warships around Okinawa Island, and the Japanese side has so far sunk or destroyed 13% of them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Fight Valiantly; Determining the Course of the War</h3>
<p>Additional News - The battle of Okinawa Island is gradually intensifying. The American forces are relying on their material strength to conduct operations, while the Japanese air and naval units are resisting with a death wish. The fighting between the two armies can be said to be determining the course of the Pacific War and is attracting considerable attention. The American forces boast that they have mobilized a total of 1,400 warships and vessels in this area, but the Japanese army is sinking or damaging dozens of them every day, causing the American forces to be apprehensive. According to the American claim, the 1,400 ships and vessels are the maximum that the Allied nations can mobilize, including all landing craft of various sizes and supply ships in the rear. Only about one-third of them are capable of engaging in combat at the front lines. The Japanese army's continuous successes against large warships (see the table below) have already reached more than half of the US Navy's strength. Therefore, the American forces may be forced to change their operational strategy in the future, which is uncertain. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Japanese army exercised restraint and waited for future opportunities. This time, with the outbreak of the Battle of Okinawa Island, the Japanese army is pouring in all its combat power in order to break the current deadlock. Day after day, special attack units, who do not expect to survive, are constantly launching fierce attacks. The outcome of this will determine the future fate of Greater East Asia, which is a matter of great concern to the people of the country. Although the American forces rely on their large quantity of materials, their strategy may not succeed, and the daily heavy losses will inevitably lead to the frustration of their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>American Warship Loss Statistics</p>
<p>The following are the statistics of American warship losses inflicted by the Japanese army in the waters off Okinawa:</p>
<p>"Sunk": Two aircraft carriers, three battleships, twenty cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, fourteen destroyers, one minesweeper, three transport ships, twenty-one ships of unknown type, five large warships, sixteen landing transport ships, one battleship or transport ship, for a total of eighty-eight vessels.</p>
<p>"Sunk or Damaged": Two aircraft carriers, one battleship, for a total of thirteen vessels.</p>
<p>"Damaged": One aircraft carrier, one special-purpose aircraft carrier, three battleships, eleven battleships or cruisers, four cruisers, ten destroyers, ten transport ships, thirteen ships of unknown type, fifteen large warships, eleven transport ships or aircraft carriers, one cruiser or transport ship, for a total of seventy-one vessels. The above totals to one hundred and sixty-two vessels.</p>
<p>The American forces concentrated the British, French, and Italian fleets for a desperate operation, calling it the largest fleet in the world, but its losses are also the largest in world naval history. The losses of aircraft carriers are estimated at eighty-one, and among the twenty large warships, there seem to be several aircraft carriers. In addition, seven other battleships were sunk or damaged, and the number of cruisers reached more than twenty. Furthermore, there were more than 50,000 casualties, and coupled with the losses in land battles, the damage suffered by the American forces can be said to be unprecedented.</p>

Two crashed into two transport ships, causing them to catch fire. In addition, two planes crashed into two enemy warships of unknown type. On the morning of the 1st, an enemy mobile force appeared near Ishigaki Island at the southern tip of the Ryukyu Islands. The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps immediately and fiercely crashed their planes into the enemy force, hitting an enemy aircraft carrier and causing it to catch fire. Another unit took the opportunity to launch repeated bombing attacks, causing it to suffer great damage.</p>
<p>Army Special Attack Corps: The subsequent battle results of the Japanese Army Special Attack Corps, which has been fiercely attacking enemy warship groups around Okinawa, have been confirmed as follows: In addition to what was already announced on the night of the 29th, one more cruiser was damaged.

At the same time, four fires and pillars of fire were also confirmed. Also at that time, an enemy warship of unknown type was on fire and burning north of the Kerama Islands, which should be part of the battle results of other newly formed special attack units. From 4:50 AM to 5:00 AM on the 1st, two enemy cruisers were sunk in this area. At 5:50 AM, two enemy ships of unknown type were sunk in the waters south of Minatogawa, on the south side of Okinawa Island. At about 7:00 AM, two enemy transport ships caught fire and burned due to the kamikaze attack, which could be seen from land. At 8:25 AM, two enemy destroyers were damaged in the center of the sea, causing them to catch fire and burn. At about 10:00 AM, two enemy cruisers caught fire and sank. Since the enemy's landing on the island, the Japanese army's air, land, and sea forces have jointly launched fierce attacks against enemy landing transport ships. Up to now, a total of 16 of their warships have been sunk. In addition, regarding the battle results achieved in the attack on the enemy aircraft carrier group near the Kerama Islands on the morning of the 26th, it has been further confirmed that one aircraft carrier was sunk (or heavily damaged), and one large aircraft carrier, seemingly converted from a cruiser, was also sunk.</p>

<h3>Police Neighborhoodization, Neighborhood Police-ization</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>——Speech at the farewell dinner for Director Gojima by the neighborhood association</p>
<p>Today, the people of the neighborhood association of this city are giving Director Gojima a farewell, because Director Gojima will be transferred to an important position and will soon leave Shanghai. Therefore, the people of the neighborhood association are taking this opportunity to express their sorrow at parting. I am participating in this event as a neighborhood official and would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to express my respect.</p>
<p>Director Gojima has been working in an important position in the city's police bureau for a long time. His prudence and conscientiousness in handling affairs have always been admired by the general public, especially for his cooperation and contribution to the establishment and promotion of the neighborhood system.</p>
<p>The police are civil servants, and the neighborhood association is the representative of the people. Although the identities of the police and the neighborhood association are different, their goal of serving local security is the same.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly stated that the police are the civil servants closest to the people. The feelings of the police service are most likely to cause direct observation among the people. The people's belief in politics can be effective from the service efficiency of the police, while the neighborhood personnel participate in the service entirely in the identity of the people, assisting the police in performing security work and assisting the government in promoting grassroots policies. Therefore, the neighborhood personnel can be said to be a link that further connects the police and the people.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the neighborhood system, the task of the neighborhood personnel is not only to promote the connection between the police and the people, but also to promote the connection between the people themselves. As Secretary-General Luo said in his speech at the civilian celebration on the anniversary of the return to the capital: "As a result of the British and American colonial policies promoted for hundreds of years, the citizens of Shanghai have developed a habit of emphasizing private interests, with a selfish attitude of 'sweeping the snow in front of their own doors and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs', with very little mutual assistance spirit. Even if they live in the same house, the residents on the second and third floors do not interact with each other." Since the establishment of the neighborhood organization, they have jointly undertaken public welfare services, had the opportunity to contact and get to know each other, and developed a spirit of mutual assistance. Therefore, in assisting security, such as the reduction of terrorist incidents and theft cases, and in assisting government orders, such as the public's understanding of air defense knowledge, etc., it is sufficient to prove the complementary effect of the police and the neighborhood association.</p>
<p>However, in terms of a broader mission, we need to make further efforts to improve the tasks of the police and the neighborhood association themselves, as well as the connection between them. At the beginning of Director Zhou's assumption of office as Police Chief, he repeatedly expressed his sincere desire to revitalize the police administration. On the one hand, he raised the treatment of the police in order to stabilize their lives and ensure that they could serve with peace of mind. On the other hand, he reduced the size of the agency and adjusted personnel in order to increase efficiency. In recent months, the general discipline of the police has been initially effective, which can further prove that it does not lie in the difficulty of the environment, but in whether there is a determination to work hard to rectify it. As for the neighborhood association, at the current stage of increasingly tense situation, there is a greater need for people to cooperate. The more tense the situation, the sharper the enemy's conspiracies, and the more rumors and whispers emerge endlessly. How to distinguish and crush the rumors and expose the spies so that the people will not be confused? Our neighborhood personnel should also have considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>Director Gojima used to be in charge of the special interrogation office and the economic security office, which can be said to be the special affairs work of the police. We know that special affairs work is endowed with special powers. Generally speaking, when using special powers, it is most prone to abuse. Therefore, the most necessary condition for people engaged in special affairs work is to have morality and integrity. In other words, only people with the best morals can do special affairs work. Mr. Gojima is a model with the best morals and integrity. We hope that all police special affairs personnel should take Mr. Gojima's service ethics as a model.</p>
<p>Secondly, one of the main tasks of special affairs work is intelligence. The source of intelligence is based on the dynamics of all aspects. However, for the content of the intelligence, we hope that it can be used as an objective reference. If it needs to be treated as a fact, it must first be carefully judged, and then the truthfulness of the intelligence is determined. Therefore, people engaged in intelligence work must have a wealth of common sense and a fine judgment. In other words, only people with rich common sense can be competent for intelligence work. As mentioned above, under the current situation, rumors in Shanghai emerge endlessly, and neighborhood personnel must distinguish them. However, general intelligence personnel cannot use rumors as intelligence material. In the past, inaccurate intelligence caused much suffering to the people, but it has been reduced. Now that Mr. Gojima is about to leave office, we hope that the remaining serving officials will take Mr. Gojima's ability to lead and handle matters clearly as a model and not be influenced by anyone's intelligence.</p>
<p>In short, the task of both general police and special police is to serve the people and make them respect and love them as the only goal. And the task of the neighborhood personnel is also to assist the police in achieving their task as the goal. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the police neighborhoodization and neighborhood police-ization, so that the police, the neighborhood association, and the people can truly become one, without any gaps. I respectfully offer this intention to reciprocate Mr. Gojima's past efforts, and I encourage the police and neighborhood personnel together.</p>
<h3>German People in Occupied Territories Launch Freedom Movement; Resolve to Resist Unwavering</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a German report: The German Socialist Party Freedom Movement has been launched in the occupied areas on the eastern and western fronts. Its propaganda organ, the "Wulfel" radio station, issued a declaration to the German people for the first time on Easter Sunday, solemnly declaring that the men, women, old, and young in the German occupied areas are determined to continue fighting behind the enemy's lines and make the enemy pay for all the losses suffered by the German people, so as to preserve freedom and glory.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: Although the success of the anti-Axis forces crossing the Rhine River and launching a new offensive towards the center of Germany is obvious, the German people's determination to resist remains unwavering. Now that the enemy has ventured deep into German territory, it must be difficult to transport supplies by land or air, such as the raw materials needed for tanks, for example. The German army will take advantage of the enemy's breathing time to organize new defense lines, attempting to encircle the enemy forces in the Ruhr area from the south and reach the Soest and Lippstadt urban areas. The defending forces are still fighting hard.</p>
<h3>British Armored Vehicle Convoy Deep in German Territory; Street Fighting in the City of Münster</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: The British armored forces have crossed between Münster and Hamm and are now reaching the famous Teutoburg Forest south of Bielefeld. There is fierce fighting in the city of Münster.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Brazil Resume Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: The Brazilian Foreign Minister announced yesterday that Brazil and the Soviet Union have established diplomatic relations, but no mention was made of the candidates for the new ministers.</p>
<h3>Two Divisions of Hu Zongnan's Army Transferred to Yunnan Province</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, this day (Central News Agency) - The so-called military foundation for the southwestern counteroffensive in Chongqing has not yet been completed, and various situations are not yet mature. At present, it is only a period of speculation. According to recent information arriving in the area, the 45th Division and the 8th Division of Hu Zongnan's elite troops, directly under Chiang Kai-shek, have been deployed to the headquarters of the Chinese Army and Air Force in Kunming and are under the direct command of the headquarters. The army is now assembling in central Yunnan. The purpose of stationing these "tiger cub" troops of Chiang Kai-shek in the area is purely to have the local troops stationed in Kunming and Baoshan directly supervised by Hu Zongnan. At the same time, in order to reorganize and integrate the local armies of Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan and centralize them, Li Zongren was appointed as the Director of the Hanzhong Command. In addition, the fact that Liu Zhi, the Commander of the Chongqing Garrison, was sent to the southwestern front line is also intended to promote the centralization of the defense forces in various places. However, these local warlords who have occupied the area for many years are not as willing to submit as imagined. Therefore, the preparations for the southwestern general counteroffensive are in a state of slow progress.</p>
<h3>Dreamlike San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>— Weiichi Kishi, Intelligence Director of the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>Voting Procedures</p>
<p>Regarding the voting procedures of the council, Britain and the United States advocate for majority voting, while the Soviet Union insists on unanimous agreement for passage. The result will at least reach a compromise where the permanent council members are in agreement. However, when a permanent council member becomes a party to a dispute, the Soviet Union advocates for the disputing party to participate in the vote, while Britain and the United States advocate against it.</p>
<p>This issue is extremely important to the Soviet Union. The importance of the issue arises from the character of the international organization and simultaneously reflects the relationship between Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union internally. Among the so-called "United Nations," there are as many as twenty countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. It is well known that these countries all have anti-Soviet tendencies. On the other hand, the connection between Britain and the United States, as clearly shown in the plans for handling European problems, is a kind of political alliance against the Soviet Union. Therefore, when disputes arise among the three countries in the future (and there are already many possibilities for this to happen), for example, in handling issues such as Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria in Europe, in handling issues such as Turkey in the Near East and Middle East, and in handling issues between Manchuria and China in East Asia, as well as the British and American issues concerning the source of goods in the South Seas, it is quite obvious that solutions most favorable to Britain and the United States will be made without Soviet supervision and substantial prevention. At this time, no matter how the issue is raised, the so-called public opinion of the anti-Axis countries will be unfavorable to the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union seeks to protect itself, it will lead to a state of affairs where war breaks out. At that time, the council will become the sole body for defining "aggressor nations," and the Soviet Union will inevitably be subjected to punishment. Therefore, the Soviet Union, as a member of the international organization, would instead receive the same treatment as the current anti-Axis countries give to Germany, which is inevitable. Therefore, the Soviet Union should carefully pay attention to the use of the council, which has strong power, to avoid being labeled as a criminal country under the ambiguous definition of "aggression" without its consent. It is said that during the previous Crimean Conference, opinions on the voting issue were completely unified. If Britain and the United States accept the Soviet Union's proposal, then the Security Council would naturally not be able to interfere in disputes between the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and this system would collapse from its foundations.</p>
<p>So-called aggression and opposition to aggression are not inherent qualities of a country. When the development law of a nation or country that is constantly developing is suppressed, it immediately unleashes destructive forces. For example, the Vienna Conference mechanism collapsed after more than ten years, and the Versailles system also collapsed after twenty years. The concept of aggression and anti-aggression is that countries that maintain the status quo believe that their power is reliable. For a small number of countries demanding a change in the status quo, they adopt resolutions of "belligerent nations" by majority vote, and belligerent nations are judged to be aggressors. From this perspective, aggression is induced by the anti-aggression countries themselves.</p>
<p>In summary, aggression and anti-aggression are not based on actual concepts of events, but are nothing more than policy-based and relative concepts. The primary goal of the United Nations is to prevent aggression. Therefore, they determine that the use of force is the most effective measure. They fundamentally do not examine the substance of the world situation in which aggression occurs and seek to deal with it. Therefore, wars will break out one after another. After the end of the Second World War, the Third World War will occur again.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in addition to the superficial and institutional defects that prevent the United Nations from contributing to the maintenance of world peace, the fate of the San Francisco Conference, which will end as a dreamlike conference, stems from fundamental issues. These fundamental issues are what we should value and reconsider most, and should also be the subject of criticism. For the sake of world humanity, for the sake of the people of East Asia, and even more for the sake of the people of the anti-Axis countries who dream of achieving peace through this kind of institution, we must clarify these issues. Now, let's discuss this issue.</p>
<p>Fundamental Defects of the United Nations</p>
<p>When we make a historical observation of this issue, it is necessary to reflect once again on how the League of Nations failed. Originally, the reason why the League of Nations inevitably fell into a dead end was because of fundamental defects. This is not a question of the authority of the council and the general assembly, or the formal institutions such as the United States not participating. If we only view the reason for the failure of the League of Nations as the weakness and ineffectiveness of the League Council, the feeling of restraint when implementing sanctions, and the failure to take effective measures quickly, and do not understand its fundamental defects, then no matter how the League's institutions are revised, they will still be castles in the air.</p>
<p>The first fundamental defect of the League was that it was entirely a product of hostility. Therefore, it became an organization dedicated to upholding the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, the main intention of Britain, the United States, and France was how to prevent Germany from rising again, how to make Germany compensate for its losses, and how to punish Germany. They falsely believed that if these central issues were resolved, world peace could be expected, which was a shallow theory. There was no theoretical distinction between the League and the idea of building a world peace institution after the end of the war. While the League promoted the construction of human peace, it also solidified the situation caused by the destruction of war. It had no constructive ideals to contribute to the development of the new world and the prosperity of culture.</p>
<p>The second fundamental defect of the League was that the relatively progressive clauses left in its Covenant became completely nominal. Article 19 of the Covenant stipulated that "The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world." This provision was extremely ambiguous, because it is difficult to expect world peace to be based on the solidification of the status quo. Instead, the solidification of the status quo endangers world peace. Therefore, it hinted at conducting a review of this kind of international state in order to make peaceful changes. However, this provision was completely ignored because it did not clearly state under what kind of ideology the international state should be examined, and because of the historical character from which the League arose.</p>
<p>International problems that required changes to the status quo, such as the revival of Germany, the self-awareness of Italy, and the suppression of everything from the Manchurian Incident as a threat of aggression, and the development of internal national movements, were further led into the greatest crisis.</p>
<p>When we observe the Security Council, we can see that there is no reflection whatsoever. Just as Wilson praised the Fourteen Points as the blessings of the world, which resulted in the Treaty of Versailles, now they praise the Atlantic Charter and decided on the Crimean Conference. They recently held meetings in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran. The ideals they wanted to maintain have completely failed. Only medieval ideas have suddenly re-emerged. A monster that treats the world as an enemy has been created under the beautiful name of world peace. It is predicted that the dark ages of modern times will reappear today. The idea that dominates them is to conclude exploitative treaties characterized by capitalist warfare, and the Security Council is the one that forcibly implements these treaties.</p>
<p>Secondly, the "peaceful change of international state," which was added to the Covenant of the League of Nations due to a moment of conscience, was not mentioned at all in this current United Nations. Their intention is clearly to maintain the status quo with international force and regard it as one and the same with world peace. Even if this kind of peace can be勉强 maintained in the shortest period, it cannot enable national advancement, and there is no development of art and culture. Because there is no development of art and culture, there is no progress of mankind. Since there is no progress of mankind, how can we seek happiness and prosperity? This is not peace, but stagnation and inertia, and its lifespan is extremely short. Because the nations and countries represented by the United Nations, in addition to having the same intentions as the United Nations, are constantly working hard to complete their own tasks. At the same time, among the group of countries participating in the United Nations, except for Britain and the United States, which are satisfied with maintaining the status quo, most of them are constantly demanding changes to the status quo. Therefore, suppressing these progressive trends in politics, economy, and culture is not something that collective force can do. Collective force will also disintegrate. Especially the First and Second World Wars have the effect of unfolding national self-awareness and the theft of a major movement. Therefore, various ethnic groups and countries welcome the world order that is about to be built. This trend is caused by history and is the normal path of human evolution. It is of course difficult to cope with the ideas after the First World War. In fact, the International County Union is from the beginning but a substitute for a rather tragic fate.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the conference to be held in San Francisco on April 25, which boasts of establishing world peace, is nothing more than a continuation of war. Apart from strengthening the means of war, there is nothing else. The true peace and cultural creation that mankind seeks can only be achieved by surpassing war. To transcend war, as Hu Liangcheng pointed out, is for each country to objectively and deeply study the historical facts and historical development that occurred due to war. On this basis, each country unfolds its own internal movement, resolves domestic problems separately, and independently guides the resolution of international problems. This matter has been explained by the fact that the current war is a total war, and under the national general mobilization warfare system. Since all ethnic groups participate in the war, they have to intervene in the resolution of the war. All countries and ethnic groups have the same goal and common ideals, which is a world order that allows any ethnic group to resolve its own national problems. In other words, it is nothing more than the idea of enabling all nations to get what they deserve and all people to live in peace. This idea can never be fulfilled by any treaty provisions. This has been revealed by the progress of facts. The new world order should adapt to the direction of this movement and stipulate the relations between countries. The San Francisco Conference has denied the progress of this law of human social movement, and has caused chaos and war.</p>

<p>I am humbled by your warm invitation today. Now I take this opportunity to express my gratitude. I have been serving in Shanghai, and it has been over four years. During this period, I have always strived to promote the welfare of all citizens and the general society of Shanghai. Often, there may have been some points that failed to proceed smoothly according to ideals in promoting work, and I deeply apologize to the people of Shanghai and hope for your understanding. I will soon be leaving Shanghai due to my new assignment. When I was in office, I received a lot of help from celebrities from all walks of life and members of society to complete my mission, and I am truly grateful. I will continue to study and improve based on your teachings. In the future, if there is an opportunity to come to Shanghai to work again, I hope to continue to serve. At the same time, I sincerely hope that you will give the same enthusiastic guidance and assistance to the successor as you have given to me in the past. The current situation is severe, and I hope that you will further cooperate with the police to promote the smooth progress of Shanghai's police work. Finally, I wish you all good health and thank you for your warm hospitality.</p>

During the banquet, everyone raised their glasses to congratulate each other, and the atmosphere was joyful and harmonious until after 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Speech by Director Gu</p>
<p>First, Director Lai delivered a farewell speech, saying: "Today, the eighteen units of the Baojia districts in this city are here to send off Director Goshima's honorable departure. Mr. Goshima took the lead in establishing the Shanghai Baojia system, resulting in the scale it has today. Now that he is leaving Shanghai due to his honorable appointment, we cannot help but feel reluctant. In the future, we can only work harder to complete the mission of the Baojia so as not to let down Director Goshima's enthusiasm for initiating it. Although the municipal Baojia organization has a scale, we have always felt that the central leadership is not strong enough. Now we are fortunate that Secretary-General Luo of the municipal government has been specially appointed as the director of the Urban Baojia Committee. We are very happy that the leadership of the urban Baojia has been obtained. Finally, I ask everyone to raise their glasses and wish Director Goshima a boundless future."</p>
<p>Secretary-General's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo said: "Today, Shanghai's Baojia personnel are here to bid farewell to Director Goshima. Director Goshima is truly the first contributor to Shanghai's Baojia. Now that he is about to depart on his honorable transfer, we cannot help but feel reluctant. I have attended the farewell to Director Goshima for the third time today. What I hope for today is, first, that Director Goshima will return to Shanghai as soon as possible, and second, that although Director Goshima is leaving, I sincerely hope that you will work harder in your respective positions and work for Shanghai Baojia as Director Goshima did when he was in Shanghai. I am now serving as the director of the Urban Baojia Committee, and we are colleagues. I still hope for your assistance at any time. Finally, I hope that all the Baotian personnel in the city will take 'Director Goshima's spirit of handling affairs' as a model and maintain it forever."</p>
<p>Goshima's Response</p>
<p>Director Goshima responded: "I am very grateful for your warm hospitality when I am about to leave the country due to this order. Secretary-General Luo's praise for me was too much, and I am very grateful. In the past, my work was made successful by the leadership of the superiors, the assistance of all colleagues, and the hard work of my subordinates. I will certainly work harder in my position in the future to meet your expectations. In the future, Shanghai's Baojia work will become even more important in order to adapt to the needs of the current situation, and I hope that you will work even harder."</p>
<h3>Model Volunteer Security Corps in Each District Holds First Pre-Inspection, with More Than 7,000 Participants from Fourteen Districts</h3>
<p>The model volunteer security corps in each district under the unified organization of the Municipal Police Bureau's Baojia Volunteer Security Corps Headquarters solemnly held its first pre-inspection at the Central Plaza of the Jockey Club on Jing'an Temple Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (3rd). The model volunteer security corps in each district first assembled in formation at the Jockey Club after 8:00 AM. The inspection was presided over by Gu Jiwu, director of the Municipal Police Bureau's Baojia Department, Mao Goshima, director of the Special Affairs Department, and Hiraga Yuzo, director of the Second Affairs Department. Vice Director Kawada of the Baojia Department, Police Inspector Sasaki, as well as the police station chiefs, the heads of joint guarantees in each district, Baojia committee members, and the heads of Baojia, totaling no less than several thousand people, were present. The model volunteer security corps members wore uniforms and were in high spirits. The Baojia volunteer security bands from each district such as the Old Gate and Taishan all came to the site to play music. Zhao Gang and Liu Bingquan served as the general commanders. The inspection included 152 teams from fourteen districts, totaling more than 7,600 people. Director Gu, Director Goshima, and Director Hiraoka led the inspection officers in inspecting them in turn. After the inspection ceremony was completed, the Baojia department director was invited to give instructions, praising the members for their orderly pace and hoping that the members would work hard in the future, take Baojia as the foundation, and make it great to contribute to the country. Then, Director Goshima was invited to give instructions, expressing his joy at the spirit of the members. As the current situation becomes increasingly serious, the responsibility of serving the local area becomes even greater. He earnestly hoped to continue to move forward. Now that he has been transferred and will soon return to his country, he wished everyone good health and hoped to see them again. The pre-inspection finally ended at 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Decides on Personnel Quota</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the governance, the Municipal Police Bureau has reorganized its institutions and reorganized its personnel. The bureau has decided on a personnel quota of 11,000 people as a principle. Previously, there were more than 15,000 people. Among them, 3,000 people have been laid off one after another. There are now more than 1,200 people. In addition to the more than 200 people who are I members who have also been formally eliminated, there are still more than 1,000 people who will be reviewed separately by the various departments, sections, branches, teams, and offices. Redundant staff who are usually ineffective, lack ability, and have bad character will be laid off again. This third batch of laid-off personnel will be announced within days and will be issued retirement salaries as usual to show compassion. As for those who are dismissed for cause, retirement benefits will not be paid.</p>
<h3>Qingxiang Bureau Chief Su Chengde Inspects the Six Islands of Pudong</h3>
<p>Su Chengde, director of the Municipal Qingxiang Bureau, realized that the local security of the city has a close relationship with the Qingxiang areas in the suburbs of Shanghai. Therefore, on the morning of March 26, he and Chief of Staff Xiong Jiandong of the Security Command led senior staff members to inspect the six islands of Hengsha Yuanyuan Sha in Pudong. He inquired about the conditions of the people along the way in a very detailed and sincere manner. He finished the inspection on the 2nd of this month and is determined to improve the various administrative facilities in the area in order to consolidate the local security of the city.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Suzhou Boat Investigation</h3>
<p>— Investigation of Shanghai-Suzhou Boats</p>
<p>Currently, the only private company operating steamboats between Shanghai and Suzhou is Shengchang Shipping Company, located at 998 North Suzhou Road (east of Xizang Road Bridge), serving as the agent for the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Company. The steamboats and coal are supplied by the Inland River Company, while passenger services are managed by Shengchang Company.</p>
<p>Currently, there is one sailing every other day. When the Inland River Company has surplus boats on other routes, temporary sailings are added. Small steamboats have 100 horsepower and can tow seven or eight passenger boats or company boats. Smaller tugboats can carry 100 passengers, while larger ones can carry over 200 passengers. Therefore, each boat can carry an average of 150 passengers, with a maximum of 1,200 tickets sold per sailing.</p>
<p>The ticket price from Shanghai to Suzhou is 1,500 yuan, but with incidental expenses and "small account" surcharges along the way, the actual selling price is 2,000 yuan per ticket. Tickets must be purchased by queuing up at the company entrance the day before departure. When purchasing, the residential address and name must be recorded on the back of the ticket. Currently, there is no black market activity. People purchase in an orderly fashion, and there is no scrambling. The company managers, Cao Guorong and Zai Pengling, are very strict with their employees, so the employees are very polite to the customers. When there are many passengers, they try to add boats, and tickets are also sold in appropriate quantities.</p>
<p>The departure time is 6:00 AM every other day. The actual travel time is only 16 hours, but inspections along the way delay it by 14-15 hours. Small pieces of luggage can be carried on board free of charge. For large items, the company must be contacted the day before to calculate the load capacity and arrange placement. The freight cost depends on the weight, generally 500-600 yuan per item, up to over 1,000 yuan. Due to the numerous inspections along the way, there are fewer individual traders on board. Meals on board cost 800 yuan each, and porridge costs 300 yuan each. If you want to save money, you can bring your own dry food. The entire route is 294 li, passing through more than 20 inspection checkpoints.</p>

<h3>Various Police Precincts Strictly Investigate Gambling; Vagrants Sent to Labor Camps for Training</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, due to the recent surge in gambling in the city, has discovered that some lawless elements are openly setting up small gambling stalls on streets and in neighborhoods, gathering crowds to gamble, and even causing conflicts and fights due to winning and losing. Some are opening clan rifle apartments, or using brothels or clubs as fronts to collect commissions and gather for gambling. This has a significant and serious impact on social morals and public order. Therefore, it has ordered all precincts to strictly investigate and handle these cases according to the law. As for general vagrants, they will be sent to vagrant labor camps for training.</p>
<p>Recently, the Xincheng and Lao Zha precincts have cracked gambling cases, and all those involved have been sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to the law.</p>
<h3>First Preparatory Meeting Held for Shanghai Wartime People's Congress</h3>

<h3>City Finance Bureau Abolishes Madang Road Office</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen administrative efficiency, the City Finance Bureau has gradually adjusted its administrative structure. All donation and tax promotion matters will be handled by branch collection offices and collection points established in appropriate areas, under the supervision of the relevant departments of the bureau. It is learned that the bureau has closed and abolished the Madang Road office on March 31. Except for vehicle license matters, which have been moved to the former site on Changxing Road, entertainment tax matters have been merged with the license department. For the convenience of those obtaining licenses, business licenses and house sublease licenses will still be processed at 80 Madang Road. However, the business license tax was originally collected by the bureau's personnel at various locations, and it has now been decided to notify business operators to pay the tax themselves at the bureau's collection point at 80 Madang Road.</p>

<h3>Free School Officially Opens; Hope for Assistance and Guidance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The ten free elementary schools sponsored by this office have been enrolling students recently, and the situation is good. There are many applicants, and classes will officially begin tomorrow. Regarding the teachers of each school, the Voluntary Committee has selected and hired twenty teachers, whose academic qualifications and experience are quite excellent. Because the curriculum, organization, and teaching of the free school are different from those of ordinary elementary schools, this office conducted short-term training at the Xinguang Road Elementary School, with Mr. Shen Baiying, an expert in elementary education, appointed by the committee to be the main speaker. Scientific methods have been determined to achieve practical results in the teaching of free schools and to achieve perfect goals in moral education management, in order to obtain the highest efficiency in compulsory education.</p>
<p>Saving Breakfast Money to Donate to Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>Elementary school students Yao Jinfeng and Yao Jinming deeply sympathize with the free elementary school of this office because they previously felt the pain of being out of school. In their letter, they said: "We are elementary school students, and our family is not wealthy, so we have no extra money to donate to your newspaper. However, from the day when Mr. Xie Lilin initiated the Huaxuejin scholarship campaign until now, we have been going hungry every morning, saving our breakfast money, accumulating Zhongchu coupons worth 1,000 yuan, which we specially offer to your newspaper as a free school fund. There are also several old books to be used as textbooks for the free school."</p>
<p>These two children are willing to go hungry and save their snack money to donate to the free school fund. Although the amount is small, the sincerity of their motivation is great. There are countless people in society who have more power to help others than these two children, but do they not have the enthusiasm to help?</p>
