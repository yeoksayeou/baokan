<h3>全國各地分別召開　統一救國民衆會　首都大會定明日熱烈舉行</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　全國各地定二十一日分別召開統一救國運動民衆大會，首都方面籌備亦已就緒，定是日上午八時，在國民大會堂熱烈舉行，届時由市商會、安靑協會、敎育會、新聞協會、醫師公會、文化界代表、婦女協會等民衆團體，組成主席團，負責進行，參加者包括京市各界民衆團體代表等六千餘人，參加單位計有工商界代表、各區民衆代表、東亞聯盟總會、工商靑年聯誼會、各中等學校以上學生、首都國民義務勞動團、義勇警察隊等，届時上午大會舉行後，下午並舉行大遊行。下午八時二十分至三十分，有民衆代表葛亮聽在中央電台舉行特別廣播。又統一救國運動標語　實現全而和平，完成全國統一。　黨不可分，國須統一。　內求和平統一，外求獨立自主。　肅正思想，確立治安，增加生產。　開放言論，暢達民意。　勵行廉潔政治。　反對列强在中國作戰。</p>

<h3>日有絕對把握　增產特攻機　三菱負責人談</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　冲繩航空決戰，於十四日以來，俄然進入混戰狀態，然日特攻隊相繼突入於敵艦船團上空衝撞猛炸，故其戰果朱能一一確認，現敵航空母艦之損失相當重大，敵艦戰機對琉球羣島之來襲，如十七日累計不過一百數十架，對冲繩本島之來襲，連同陸上機累計不過三百數十架，足證敵海空勢力已漸被日航空攻擊所壓制。但敵軍能忍耐此種未曾有之消耗，以其全力企圖奪取冲繩，如十五，十六兩日，以百機左右之艦戰機來襲九州地區，於十七，十八兩日，更使B28型空襲九州地區，作戰術轟炸，將曾用於戰略轟炸之B29型，再用於戰術轟炸，是證冲繩方面之敵海上勢力已告弱化，對於陸上戰鬥，已不能作充分之協力，至其艦上機勢力，企圖切斷日本木土之航空兵力源泉，反覆實行戰術轟炸戰，此敵美戰意實難忽視者。今沖繩決戰，已因日特攻隊之犧牲，日本作有利進展之良機已將來臨，能否完全把握此種良機，由敵美戰意之强　性視之，須視彼我能否忍耐消耗補給而定。溯自三月二十三日以來，僅確認之戰果，日方已擊沉擊毀敵美艦船約四百艘，若以日機三架可擊沉敵艦一艘計算，則日本特攻機已損失一千架，故不論能否完全把握擊碎企圖，若缺少最後補給，則戰局與日方更為重大，故日本應增產特攻機，努力補給，以把握擊減敵美之良機。關於增產特攻機一事，據日本三菱重工業公司負責人石耕三談稱：增產特攻機，本人確信有絕對把握，決不致因飛機之生產而喪失追擊戰之良機，在追擊戰時，至為貴重之戰機，已由歷史予以證明，當前冲繩島之戰局，實為擊滅敵美之良機，吾人決意克服任何困難，以良好之飛機，輸往前綫。又關於日本航空機生產之永續性，可不必担憂，當因生產木造機，日本因地理條件，木材資源頗為豐富，又燃燒木材可取瓦斯，可獲得良好之航空燃料，木炭可充汽車燃料，用以確保輸送能力，由此點觀之，日本航空機之生產，頗為樂觀，雖戰至五十年或百年，亦屬無妨，吾人確信神州不滅，奮鬥到底。</p>
<h3>鈴木首相列席日大本營會議　今後將共同指導作戰</h3>

<h3>冲繩敵美艦隊　陷於混亂狀態　松島部長闡述戰況</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部常會，於昨日下午舉行，到松島部長。松平大尉及各報記者多人，由松島部長闡述冲繩島戰况，敵美艦隊因損失重大已陷於極混亂狀態。其次關於一九四六年之美國海軍預算數目，已較過去減少，足微其資源人力，大受打擊。茲分誌演詞概要如次：</p>
<p>沖繩日軍發動攻勢</p>
<p>日本陸海航空部隊，對冲繩島周圍海面之敵機動部隊，於十一日以來，連續施以猛烈攻擊，截至十七日止，所獲戰果如次。擊沉擊破敵艦艇三百九十三艘，實為空前未有之大戰果，尤其十六十七兩日，擊沉敵航空母艦五艘，如此之大戰果，對於今後作戰上，實有極大影響。但敵美雖遭受多量之損害，依然不斷從後方向第一錢加以補充，在十六日之前，敵方所結集之航空母艦約十二艘至十四艘，十六十七兩日中，日海軍擊破敵美剩餘之航空母艦在半數以上，敵方此種損害，在今後機動戰上，實有重大影響。敵方為挽救此危局，乃利用B29型機，轟炸日本本土，並由硫黃島方面，發動B24型機，希望以轟炸切斷日本本土與冲繩島間之連絡。根據我人之判斷，敵第一綫與後方兵力，除航空母艦外，其在冲繩島周圍海面結集之艦艇，數目如次：戰艦五艘至七艘，巡洋艦十艘至十三艘，　逐艦約二十艘，掃海艇約二十艘，輸送船八十艘，此外在烏魯希方面似有航空母艦三艘戰艦五艘以上，各艦均已受到相常損害。陸上戰鬥，南部戰綫因日軍之猛烈攻擊，敵人一再大最出血，北部戰綫沉默已久之莫托本半島，日軍精銳業已發動攻勢，此係根據敵方報道而知者，故現在之戰局，實為轉捩之重大時期，而敵人因遭受意外之損害，已陷於極大混亂狀態。其報道中對於海戰情形隻字未提，所受損失之慘重，由此蓋可想見矣。</p>
<p>特魯曼對蘇之媚態</p>
<p>美新總統特魯曼最近十七日首次會見新聞記者時，表示美國對於蘇聯之種種關心情形，同時於另一方面，將美國對蘇聯之軍火貸予份量，有所表明，特魯曼對於蘇聯之媚態可見一斑。美國貨予蘇聯之武器，一九四一年十月起，至一九四二年二月止，總值八十二億二千五百萬美金，其數量則爲對聯合國所供給之軍火之百分之三十二，飛機一項，約爲一萬三千架。美國在任何方面其舉動概以物量入手，是以我人今後對於其政略戰略上，亟應加以注意也。</p>
<p>海軍預算減少甚鉅</p>
<p>本月十七日美衆議院呈報一九四六年之海軍預算數目，爲二百三十四億五萬二千三百三十三美金，與去歲比較，相差五千一億元之鉅。美國之海軍艘艇既遭受多量之損害，而其明年度之預算反而減少，足見其資源與人力方面之貧乏情形也。</p>
<p>戰後美國海軍野心</p>
<p>美海長福雷斯德稱：戰後美國至少須保有艦船五千八百三十艘，海軍總司令金大將，則堅持在太平洋上美國應保有馬紹爾·加洛林·及馬利亞納諸羣島，故美國對於戰後太平洋所抱之希望如何，可以瞭然。其次美國太平洋艦隊之實力，向未綜合發表，惟據推測正式航空母艦約三至五艘，特式航母約十艘，作爲基本部隊，在琉球羣島海面活動者，即爲航母二艘，益以若干戰艦所組成之機動部隊。本月十七日紐約泰唔士報發表漢森·鮑爾溫。之新聞解釋，略謂：英國艦隊不久將從緬甸，馬來及蘇門答　印度洋上，向新加坡發動攻勢，似此種作戰，須根據英國艦隊之活動程度而定，今英艦隊改在琉球受到極大損失，能否實現上述計劃，亦殊屬疑問耳。</p>
<p>渝方空軍近甚活躍</p>
<p>大陸方面，最近渝空軍甚為活躍，北方河南京漢綫，南方長江流域及粵漢綫一帶，均為其活躍之範圍，渝空軍在本國領土上施以轟炸，破壞本國人之生命財產，此為去年末來自美國之一班「美國派」飛機師所為者，此舉與美國對戰後中國之野心，相互對照，其心理如何，實無法了解也。本月八日尼米茲司令部發表，美軍在硫黃島依舊進行掃蕩戰，可知日軍即戰至一兵一卒，仍奮勇力戰，發揮其犧牲之報國精神。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>柏林會戰之展望</h3>
<p>歐洲戰局的發展，已漸逼近頂點，柏林雖處於暴風雨的前夕，而德國軍民，都已因柏林戰塲化之必然性而預作稱種準備。綜合日來各方電訊，可知柏林會戰已經揭其序幕。</p>
<p>就聯合國的政略及戰略來　，今日的柏林大會戰，將視為一九一八年九月之興登堡陣綫總攻擊的重演。與登堡陣綫一役，為第一次世界大戰的最後一戰，以英美為首的協約國參謀總部，至今懷着舊夢重溫的野心，而本年二月克里米亞會議關於舊金山會議時期與地點之明白公布，也可以反映反軸心國最高統帥部這種野心，他們預定於四月二十日前後結東歐戰，二十五日在太平洋東岸之舊金山召開協約國會議。觀乎克里米亞會議以後，歐洲東綫，蘇軍至柏林東方門戶之庫斯特林要塞而按兵不動，　待西綫美英加軍之前進，以至迫近柏林與東綫相同的數十公里地點，始再度於日前展開對柏林總攻，則反軸心國上述政戰二略；已瞭如指掌。</p>
<p>但是，柏林的局勢雖然緊張，而柏林的股高統帥部並沒有表示慌忙。希特勒元首於本月十七日勉勗將士，指稱「戰爭必有轉變之可能」，並下令「凡搜自下令退却者，將不問其官級如何，就地逮捕，倘遇必要，將予以就地槍決」，其堅決進行柏林大會戰，決不讓敵方輕易獲得柏林而實現預定計劃，從這裏已可看出。然而敵方預定會師柏林市內的日期，却只有幾天了；蘇軍之二小時四百五十餘發砲彈的猛攻，正是以見反軸心國對柏林大會戰的焦急。然而，速戰速決事實上常不可能，柏林堅持到四月二十五日以後，亦勢所必然。</p>
<p>其次，柏林會戰的結果，無論如何，也不能和一九一八年的興登堡之戰相比。今日德國全境，還沒有一九一八年當時不能不屈服的條件。當時作為興登堡之戰的背景的，是德國全國規模的大飢荒，前綫喪失了人力及物質的後援；反之，敵方則以生力軍的美國之參加而增强戰力，可是今日德國，上下一致，保衛祖國之意志仍極堅强；前綫戰局雖嚴重，面將士所煩以堅持之人力和物質補充仍源源不絕，各地遍佈　護政府的「人民襲擊隊」。所以，今昔的情勢逈然不同。</p>
<p>因為上述種種原因，不諭柏林大會戰的結果如何，決不會以此為二次歐戰的最後一戰，德國民族將如希特勒元首本月十七日所宣示：「東綫士兵能人盡其職，則其進攻必將崩潰，西綫敵軍亦將與之同歸於盡」，何况易北河等處德軍的反攻亦已展閒！至於歐戰與東亞戰局，則更形勢大異，因此任何利用歐局以謀製造東亞局勢的謠言者，更是庸人自擾。總之，在此世界總決戰階段，淮有以冷靜的觀察，沉着應付，不為謠言所惑。而對於敵人乘機造謠的謀略宣傳，我們史應認淸防止。</p>
<h3>伊江島敵登陸　日軍邀擊中　沖繩陸上戰鬥無變動</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　沖繩本島之陸上戰鬥並無變動，敵似依然激烈準備攻擊日軍陸地模樣，日軍為此，連日晝夜果敢挺身反覆突擊，或候良機强化反攻，予敵極大出血，日下正在勇戰敢鬥中。一方敵對知念半島之野心，日漸暴露，其行動亦更趨活潑，又十六日晨敵以戰艦爲基　之艦隊，漸次接近本部半島方面，對伊江島以艦砲熾烈射擊並轟炸，繼之並以舟艇約百艘於伊江島實施登陸，其兵力目下為戰車約八十輛，兵員一千名，現經日軍守備部隊邀擊，展開激戰中。截至十七日判叫戰果，計殺傷兵員百名以上，戰車九輛起火燃燒。再敵使用北中兩飛機塲更形活潑，使用之飛機大部份為F6F，F4V等之艦載機，因航空母艦被炸，未能返艦之機佔有相當數字，日航空部隊繼續猛擊該兩機塲，目下正制壓中。</p>
<p>中部太平洋某基地十九日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，對侵冲繩島方面之敵美軍，毫不問斷，綱續加以猛烈攻擊，十七日午後沖繩列島綫之南部方面上空，與敵艦載機羣發生空戰，擊　其一架，餘機立即　逃，更於是日夜間奇襲沖繩本島北部飛機塲，數處中彈起火。日航空部隊十八日又　敵機熾烈對空砲火，猛攻冲繩東方及慶良間諸島方面之敵艦船羣，並突入慶良間諸島，大舉轟炸，此後日航空部隊徹夜攻擊敵艦隊。因此，敵之來襲機數顯著激減，敵航空母艦之損傷如何，可以想見矣。</p>
<h3>日軍海空總攻予敵極大威脅</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日軍為期剿滅冲繩本島周邊之敵機動部隊，行航空部隊之總攻擊，業巳三次，即六日之攻擊為第一次，十二日為第二次，十六日為第三次，於此二次總攻擊中，日軍海空一致行動，出動大量特攻隊及水雷爆擊隊，　續猛攻，尤以特攻隊之大量出擊，最為特徵。截至現在之綜合戰果，所予敵方損害，計擊沉毀敵艦達四百艘，為大東亞戰爭開始以來所未有之戰績，此次世界大戰以來，敵於東西兩戰塲强行登陸作戰，而遭受如是重大打擊，尙屬初次。敵美專恃其物量維持海上勢力，確保制空海　，並企圖積極達成攻略沖繩本島之目的已成幻想矣。</p>
<h3>日陸軍省發表五勇士受感狀</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日陸軍省十九日發表，特別攻擊隊飛行隊陸軍少尉鶴見國士郎，上宮賢治，陸軍軍曹靑本健次，陸軍伍長吉野芳積，芙阪洋男等五名，前在南西羣島附近海面拼撞敵艦船，業經授與感狀，此次並奏呈天皇聞達。</p>
<h3>日政治會電謝沖繩奮戰將士</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日本政治會南總裁，對冲繩奮戰中之陸海軍將士及當地居民之決死奮鬥，於十九日發出感謝激勵電文。</p>
<h3>日寺本中將　任航空部長</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日阿南大將就任陸相後，關於陸軍航空本部長繼任人選，業經陸軍省於今日發表，任命陸軍中將寺本能市繼任陸軍航空本部長。</p>
<h3>東京及台灣　昨白晝空襲　邀擊戰果尙在調查中</h3>

<p>財政部周部長以邇來上海證券交易掀起劇烈波動，證券市價漲風愈演應烈，甚至有數種股票無理升漲，招越資產所値數字兩倍以上，難免有不法市儈從中拉抬市價，證交市塲當局難辭其咎，尤其該交易所試辦便交業務以來，引起投機，證券發生波動，然交易所塲內交易份子益顯複雜。故周部長除手諭證交所停止證券便交外，特派證券交易所監理員陸聰明，會同中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處秘辦李　，檢查組長張谷如及上海特別市經濟局局畏許江，於十九日上午十時同往證券交易所，親自澈查，最近各經紀人所做交易帳目及最近股市飛漲實際原因，以憑查明處置。</p>

<h3>郝鵬舉省長談歡迎工廠遷設淮海淮海紀行之三</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>一切行政之革新，其先決條件，厥爲鞏固的經濟基礎與治安。關於此點，據郝鵬舉省長說：「淮海省的經濟，建立於農業生產上，農作物以小麥爲大宗，年產一，〇八七·二四五噸，大豆年產二八八，三六五噸，綠豆年產四六，六七〇噸，高漲年產二一九·〇二九噸，又甘蔗年產七二五，六三四噸。皆甚應當。以小麥論，兩年三熟，每畝可收五百斤。淮海雖屬大陸氣候，但有海洋氣候之調而，故能豐收，每年可餘糧約五十萬噸。以是農村經濟尙稱良好，農人生活，亦甚富裕，而其對政府繳納之捐稅，僅佔其總收入百分之四至七。</p>
<p>「又以物價言，較之南北各省約低二分之一。省政府對抑平物價之政策，乃用政治力量將商人與購買之民衆熔於一爐，故淮海之物價，尙無暴漲情形，總之，淮海省經濟甚爲穩定，照實際情形言，誠可謂為「民富官窮」。</p>
<p>「以治安言，淮海雖處於困難環境中，但終苦心維持，並未惡化。其防禦工事，日下造境建有大小據點一千一百七十餘處，有久經訓練之部隊×萬人據守之。以素質優良，與敵人相較。戰鬥力能以一敵六。軍需工業亦甚發述，如被服，裝具，皮革，軍糧，修械等，皆可自給自足。連絡通信工事，亦有週密之佈置。近爲實行法戰體制，實施人力物力精神之總動員，使淮海的每人每物，都可適合戰爭的需用。又防空方面，除各處築有防空壕外，以徐州市言，並組有警防團，團員皆由商民自行選拔，嚴行訓練，其總數約有萬人；此外有消防隊員約近千人，計分十隊。故淮海之冶安，可稱穩定。」</p>
<p>關於上海工業疏散至淮省海問題，郝氏表示極為歡迎。答說：</p>
<p>「戰爭臨到決勝階段，上海及京滬沿綫的工業，雖有元備的設備，然而一以原料缺乏；二以電力限制；三以勞力昂貴；四以交通阻滯：因此火受打擊。但在新生的淮海省，部不成問題：</p>
<p>「　原料　淮海省天賦獨厚，農產物之豐富，已如前言。至地下所所藏礦產更為驚人，堪與俄國之烏克蘭相比擬。其著者如珍貴之燐礦石（海州產）及鐵，銘，砂砂，雲母，煤等礦，又水菓則有梨，葡萄，石榴等。所以釀酒，罐頭，榨油，製革，玻璃，酒精等廠，遷來本省，最為相宜。</p>
<p>「　原動力　淮海產煤至豐，有抑泉孤山兩火煤礦，所產煤斤可盡量供給。柳泉設有電站，電力足供淮海全省工廠之需。所以電力也不成問題</p>
<p>「　勞力　淮海省介於進中華北間，統轄兩市（徐州海州）二十縣，人口約一千三百餘萬，以當地生活低廉，故勞力代價至低，壯丁也很多。目下本省工廠還少，如果大批工廠遷移淮海，勞工自無問題。祇是技術方面，須加訓練血已。</p>
<p>「最近本省已成立「工業開發協會」，是官商合辦的。主要任務，即為協助發展工業。設廠家資本不足，可由此機關員查補助其總資額十分之四。如果京滬綫工廠疏散至泔海，無論運輸，資本，廠址，勞工，燃料種稱方面，都可由這個機構，負元全協助之責。」說到這衷，話題又轉到省政府的建設方針去了。（未完）</p>
<h3>賭窟主犯王茂亭　判處徒刑二年　俄僑總會賭窟案昨宣判</h3>

<h3>Japan Has Absolute Confidence in Increasing Production of Special Attack Aircraft; Interview with Mitsubishi Representative</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Okinawa air battle has suddenly entered a state of melee since the 14th. However, Japanese special attack teams have successively broken into enemy fleets and carried out collision bombings, so the battle results can be confirmed one by one. At present, the loss of enemy aircraft carriers is quite significant. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Ryukyu Islands, as of the 17th, totaled only one hundred and dozens, and the number of attacks on Okinawa Island, including land-based aircraft, totaled only three hundred and dozens. This proves that the enemy's naval and air power has gradually been suppressed by Japanese air attacks. However, the enemy can endure this unprecedented consumption and attempt to seize Okinawa with all their strength. On the 15th and 16th, about 100 carrier-based fighters attacked the Kyushu area. On the 17th and 18th, B28s were used to bomb the Kyushu area, carrying out tactical bombing. The B29s, which were previously used for strategic bombing, are now being used for tactical bombing, which proves that the enemy's naval forces in the Okinawa area have been weakened and cannot fully cooperate with the land battles. As for their carrier-based aircraft, they are attempting to cut off the source of Japanese mainland air power by repeatedly carrying out tactical bombing warfare. This enemy's fighting spirit cannot be ignored. Now, the Okinawa decisive battle has, thanks to the sacrifices of the Japanese special attack teams, created a good opportunity for Japan to make favorable progress. Whether or not this opportunity can be fully grasped depends on the strength of the enemy's will to fight and whether we can endure consumption and resupply. Since March 23rd, it has been confirmed that the Japanese side has sunk or destroyed about 400 enemy ships. If we calculate that three Japanese aircraft can sink one enemy ship, then Japan has lost 1,000 special attack aircraft. Therefore, regardless of whether the attempt to crush the enemy can be completely grasped, the situation will be even more serious for Japan if the final resupply is lacking. Therefore, Japan should increase the production of special attack aircraft and strive to resupply in order to seize the opportunity to reduce the enemy's strength. Regarding the increase in the production of special attack aircraft, according to Ishigami Kozo, a representative of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan: I am confident that I have absolute confidence in increasing the production of special attack aircraft and will never lose the good opportunity for pursuit warfare due to the production of aircraft. Historically, the warplanes, which are most valuable in the pursuit battle, have been proven. The current battle situation on Okinawa Island is indeed a good opportunity to destroy the enemy. We are determined to overcome any difficulties and transport good aircraft to the front line. Also, there is no need to worry about the sustainability of Japanese aircraft production, because wooden aircraft can be produced. Japan is geographically blessed with abundant wood resources. Furthermore, burning wood can extract gas, which can obtain good aviation fuel, and charcoal can be used as fuel for automobiles to ensure transportation capacity. From this point of view, the production of Japanese aircraft is quite optimistic. Even if the war lasts for 50 or 100 years, it is no problem. We are confident that the Divine Land will not perish and will fight to the end.</p>

<h3>Enemy American Fleet in Okinawa Plunged into Chaos; Minister Matsushima Elaborates on the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>The Allied Japan Fleet Press Department held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by Minister Matsushima, Captain Matsudaira, and many newspaper reporters. Minister Matsushima elaborated on the battle situation on Okinawa Island, stating that the enemy American fleet has been plunged into extreme chaos due to heavy losses. Secondly, the US Navy budget for 1946 has been reduced compared to the past, which indicates that its resources and manpower have been severely hit. The main points of the speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Launch Offensive on Okinawa</p>
<p>Since the 11th, Japanese land, sea, and air forces have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile units in the waters around Okinawa Island. As of the 17th, the battle results were as follows: 393 enemy ships were sunk or destroyed, which is an unprecedented victory. In particular, five enemy aircraft carriers were sunk on the 16th and 17th. Such a great victory will have a great impact on future operations. However, although the enemy Americans have suffered a large number of casualties, they continue to replenish the front line from the rear. Before the 16th, the enemy had gathered about 12 to 14 aircraft carriers. During the 16th and 17th, the Japanese Navy destroyed more than half of the remaining enemy American aircraft carriers. This kind of damage has a significant impact on future mobile warfare. In order to save this critical situation, the enemy is using B29 aircraft to bomb the Japanese mainland, and B24 aircraft are being launched from Iwo Jima, hoping to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island through bombing. According to our judgment, the number of enemy first-line and rear forces, excluding aircraft carriers, gathered in the waters around Okinawa Island is as follows: 5 to 7 battleships, 10 to 13 cruisers, about 20 destroyers, about 20 minesweepers, and 80 transport ships. In addition, there seem to be three aircraft carriers and more than five battleships near Uruchi, and all ships have been severely damaged. In land battles, the enemy has suffered repeated and heavy casualties on the southern front due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. On the northern front, the elite Japanese forces, which have been silent for a long time, have already launched an offensive on the Motobu Peninsula. This is known from enemy reports. Therefore, the current battle situation is at a major turning point, and the enemy is in extreme chaos due to unexpected losses. Their reports do not mention the situation of the naval battle at all, which shows how terrible the losses they suffered.</p>
<p>Truman's Flattering Attitude Towards the Soviet Union</p>
<p>US President Truman, in his first meeting with reporters on the 17th, expressed the United States' concern for the Soviet Union in various ways. At the same time, he also indicated the amount of US military supplies lent to the Soviet Union. Truman's flattering attitude towards the Soviet Union is evident. The weapons that the United States lent to the Soviet Union from October 1941 to February 1942 totaled 8.225 billion US dollars, which is 32 percent of the military supplies provided to the United Nations. The number of aircraft was about 13,000. The United States always relies on material resources in everything it does, so we must pay close attention to its political and strategic policies in the future.</p>
<p>Naval Budget Reduced Significantly</p>
<p>The US House of Representatives submitted a report on the naval budget for 1946 on the 17th of this month, which amounted to 23.4052333 billion US dollars, a decrease of 5.1 billion yuan compared to last year. The US Navy has suffered a large number of ship losses, but its budget for the next year has been reduced, which shows its lack of resources and manpower.</p>
<p>Post-War Ambitions of the US Navy</p>
<p>US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal said: The United States must maintain at least 5,830 ships after the war. General King, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, insisted that the United States should retain the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands in the Pacific. Therefore, it is clear what kind of hopes the United States has for the Pacific after the war. Secondly, the strength of the US Pacific Fleet has not been comprehensively announced, but it is estimated that about three to five formal aircraft carriers and about ten special aircraft carriers are used as the basic force. Those operating in the waters of the Ryukyu Islands are a mobile force composed of two aircraft carriers and several battleships. On the 17th of this month, the New York Times published an explanation by Hanson Baldwin, which stated: The British fleet will soon launch an offensive from Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra in the Indian Ocean towards Singapore. This kind of operation depends on the level of activity of the British fleet. Now that the British fleet has suffered great losses in the Ryukyu Islands, it is doubtful whether the above plan can be realized.</p>
<p>Chongqing Air Force Very Active Recently</p>
<p>On the mainland, the Chongqing Air Force has been very active recently. The area north of the Henan-Hankou Railway, the Yangtze River basin to the south, and the area along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway are all within its range of activity. The Chongqing Air Force is bombing its own territory and destroying the lives and property of its own people. This is done by a group of "American faction" pilots who came from the United States at the end of last year. This move, compared with the American ambitions for China after the war, makes it impossible to understand their psychology. On the 8th of this month, Nimitz Headquarters announced that the US military is still conducting mopping-up operations on Iwo Jima, which shows that the Japanese army is fighting bravely and exerting its spirit of sacrifice to repay the country even when it is down to the last man.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Battle of Berlin</h3>
<p>The development of the European war situation is gradually approaching its climax. Although Berlin is on the eve of a storm, the German military and civilians have already made preparations for the inevitability of the Battle of Berlin. Combining recent dispatches from various sources, it can be known that the Battle of Berlin has already begun.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the political and strategic policies of the United Nations, today's Battle of Berlin will be regarded as a re-enactment of the general offensive on the Hindenburg Line in September 1918. The battle on the Hindenburg Line was the last battle of World War I. The general staff of the Allied powers, led by Britain and the United States, still harbor the ambition to relive their old dreams. The explicit announcement of the time and location of the San Francisco Conference at the Crimean Conference in February this year can also reflect this ambition of the supreme command of the anti-Axis powers. They plan to end the European war around April 20 and convene an Allied conference in San Francisco on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean on the 25th. Looking at the situation after the Crimean Conference, on the eastern front in Europe, the Soviet army has been inactive at the Kustrin Fortress, the eastern gateway to Berlin, waiting for the advance of the American, British, and Canadian forces on the western front, so as to approach Berlin at the same distance of tens of kilometers as the eastern front, before launching a general offensive on Berlin again recently. The above-mentioned political and strategic policies of the anti-Axis powers are already clear.</p>
<p>However, although the situation in Berlin is tense, the supreme command in Berlin has not shown any panic. Leader Hitler encouraged the soldiers on the 17th of this month, pointing out that "there is always the possibility of a change in the war," and ordered "anyone who orders a retreat will be arrested on the spot regardless of their rank, and if necessary, will be executed on the spot." His determination to carry out the Battle of Berlin and not allow the enemy to easily obtain Berlin and realize the predetermined plan can already be seen from this. However, the enemy's scheduled date for converging in Berlin is only a few days away. The Soviet army's fierce attack of more than 450 shells in two hours is precisely to show the anxiety of the anti-Axis powers about the Battle of Berlin. However, a quick victory and quick decision are often impossible in fact. It is inevitable that Berlin will hold out until after April 25.</p>
<p>Secondly, the outcome of the Battle of Berlin, no matter what, cannot be compared with the Battle of the Hindenburg Line in 1918. Today, the entire territory of Germany does not yet have the conditions that made it impossible not to surrender in 1918. The background of the Battle of the Hindenburg Line at that time was a large-scale famine throughout Germany, and the front line lost the support of manpower and material resources. On the other hand, the enemy strengthened its combat power with the participation of the American fresh troops. But today in Germany, everyone is united, and the will to defend the motherland is still very strong. Although the front-line situation is serious, the manpower and material resources needed by the soldiers to persist are still being replenished continuously. "People's assault teams" to protect the government are spread all over the place. Therefore, the situation today and in the past is very different.</p>
<p>Because of the above-mentioned reasons, no matter what the outcome of the Battle of Berlin, it will not be the last battle of the Second European War. The German nation will be as Leader Hitler declared on the 17th of this month: "If the soldiers on the eastern front can do their duty, then their offensive will inevitably collapse, and the enemy on the western front will perish with them." What's more, the German counterattacks in the Elbe River and other places have already begun! As for the war in Europe and the war in East Asia, the situation is even more different. Therefore, anyone who uses the situation in Europe to create rumors about the situation in East Asia is simply meddling. In short, at this stage of the world's total decisive battle, we must have a calm observation, respond calmly, and not be confused by rumors. And we must clearly recognize and prevent the enemy's conspiracy to create rumors.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landing on Ie Island; Japanese Forces Intercepting; No Change in Okinawa Land Battles</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - There is no change in the land battles on Okinawa Island. The enemy still seems to be preparing fiercely to attack the Japanese army's land positions. For this reason, the Japanese army has been bravely stepping forward day and night to launch repeated surprise attacks, or waiting for a good opportunity to strengthen the counterattack, inflicting great casualties on the enemy. The brave and daring fighting is currently underway. On the other hand, the enemy's ambition for the Chinen Peninsula is gradually exposed, and its actions are becoming more active. Also, on the morning of the 16th, an enemy fleet based on battleships gradually approached the Motobu Peninsula and fired fiercely and bombarded Ie Island with naval guns. Subsequently, about 100 boats landed on Ie Island. The current strength is about 80 tanks and 1,000 soldiers. They are currently being intercepted by the Japanese garrison troops, and fierce fighting is underway. As of the 17th, the confirmed battle results were: more than 100 soldiers killed or wounded, and nine tanks set on fire. Furthermore, the enemy is using the two airfields in the north and central parts of the island more actively. Most of the aircraft used are carrier-based aircraft such as F6Fs and F4Vs. Because the aircraft carriers were bombed, a considerable number of aircraft were unable to return to the ship. The Japanese air force continues to attack these two airfields fiercely, and is currently suppressing them.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese air force has been relentlessly and continuously launching fierce attacks on the enemy American forces invading Okinawa Island. On the afternoon of the 17th, an air battle occurred with enemy carrier-based aircraft over the southern part of the Okinawa Islands, shooting down one of them. The remaining aircraft immediately fled. Furthermore, on the same day, they carried out a night raid on the airfield in the northern part of Okinawa Island, and several places were hit and caught fire. On the 18th, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked the enemy fleet east of Okinawa and the Kerama Islands, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire, and launched a large-scale bombing after breaking into the Kerama Islands. After that, the Japanese air force attacked the enemy fleet all night. As a result, the number of enemy attacking aircraft has been significantly reduced. It is easy to imagine what the damage to the enemy's aircraft carriers is.</p>
<h3>Total Japanese Naval and Air Offensive Greatly Threatens the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese army has carried out a total of three general offensives by the air force to wipe out the enemy mobile units around Okinawa Island. The attack on the 6th was the first time, the 12th was the second time, and the 16th was the third time. In these two general offensives, the Japanese navy and air force acted in unison, dispatching a large number of special attack teams and mine-bombing teams to continuously launch fierce attacks. In particular, the large-scale dispatch of special attack teams was the most distinctive feature. As of now, the combined battle results show that the enemy has suffered damage totaling 400 enemy ships sunk or destroyed, which is an unprecedented achievement since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. Since this world war, it is the first time that the enemy has suffered such heavy blows in its forced landing operations on the eastern and western battlefields. The enemy Americans, who rely solely on their material resources to maintain their naval power, ensure air and sea dominance, and attempt to actively achieve the goal of capturing Okinawa Island, have already become a fantasy.</p>

<p>Taipei, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Throughout the 19th, about 80 enemy bombers and about 20 fighters took off from bases on the island and attacked Hsinchu Prefecture. After dropping bombs in Hsinchu City, they fled south at around 3:00 PM. Also, at around 9:00 AM on the 18th, about nine enemy bombers and more than 30 fighters from the Philippine Island base attacked the area north of central Taiwan several times, bombing and strafing Taichung, Tainan, Hualien Port, and some bombing and strafing trains, cities, and factories. Japanese losses were extremely light.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in New Guinea Attacks Mar Airport</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese combat unit on the northern coast of western New Guinea attacked the enemy's Sangsapor enemy positions on the front line of the enemy Mal airfield on the night of February 20th and completely occupied the position, and was able to control the Mal airfield. Subsequently, after reconnaissance by the Japanese air force, it was learned that several places on the runway of the Mal airfield had been damaged, and only a part of the buildings remained. Therefore, the enemy has completely abandoned the airfield. Also, there are currently several enemy large aircraft at the Gemini Island airfield, but the hope of using them is very weak.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Decide to Divide Operational Areas in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to enemy sources, the areas of responsibility for Pacific operations by Britain, the United States, and other countries have recently been decided. Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo belong to Britain, the former Dutch East Indies belong to the Netherlands, and the various islands in the Pacific, including the Philippines, are the responsibility of the United States. This decision can be observed in two ways: one is that the United States is unable to cope with the Japanese attacks alone, and the other is that it has the intention of dividing the spoils.</p>

<h3>Minister Zhou Sent Personnel Yesterday to Thoroughly Investigate Stock Exchange Accounts to Investigate the Reasons for the Soaring Stock Market</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Zhou believes that the recent violent fluctuations in the Shanghai Stock Exchange have led to an increasingly fierce rise in stock prices. Some stocks have risen irrationally, exceeding the value of their assets by more than double. It is inevitable that unscrupulous merchants are driving up prices, and the stock exchange authorities are responsible. In particular, since the exchange began its trial of convenient transactions, speculation has been triggered, and stock prices have fluctuated. However, the participants in the exchange have become increasingly complex. Therefore, in addition to instructing the stock exchange to suspend convenient stock transactions, Minister Zhou specially sent Lu Congming, supervisor of the Stock Exchange, Li of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, Zhang Guru, the inspection team leader, and Xu Jiang, director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau, to the Stock Exchange together at 10:00 AM on the 19th to personally thoroughly investigate the recent transaction accounts of various brokers and the actual reasons for the recent soaring stock market, in order to determine how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Outsiders from Entering the Market for Transactions</p>
<p>The Office of the Supervisor of the Shanghai Stock Exchange of the Ministry of Finance issued a notice stating: "This market is a place where various brokers and their agents gather to buy and sell on behalf of customers. Other personnel are not allowed to enter the market for transactions. From now on, except for registered brokers or their agents, market affairs personnel, supervising personnel from this office, and specially dispatched investigators from other relevant agencies, other personnel are strictly prohibited from entering the market. All personnel in the market are not allowed to entrust brokers or their agents to conduct securities trading. Once discovered, they will be severely punished."</p>
<h3>Citywide Immunization Inoculations Begin Today; Health Bureau Mobile Teams Deployed Throughout the City</h3>
<p>This year's cholera prevention inoculation has been actively prepared by the Health Bureau, and personnel and materials are all well-prepared. The inoculation will begin today (the 20th).</p>
<p>Inoculation Locations</p>
<p>It is reported that in Pudong, due to procedures and other reasons, only hospitals and clinics will carry out the inoculations first. In the urban area, the bureau has formed several mobile teams, which will be stationed at various transportation hubs every day from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM to carry out the work. The locations and dates of the mobile team's work from April 20th to 30th are listed below. Citizens are urged to pay attention and promptly request inoculation to avoid contracting the disease. Jurisdiction of the Taishan Road Branch Bureau: Nanyang Bridge Iron Gate, Ziyang Road Iron Gate, Yongtai Road Iron Gate. Jurisdiction of the Huangpu Branch Bureau: Old North Gate Iron Gate, Baidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Henan Road Bridge. Jurisdiction of the Lao Zha Branch Bureau: Zhejiang Road Bridge, Xizang Road Bridge. Jurisdiction of the Xincheng Branch Bureau: Xinzha Road Bridge.</p>
<p>Certificates Remain the Same</p>
<p>As usual, upon completion of the inoculation, the cholera prevention inoculation personnel should issue a certificate as proof. It is understood that the format of this year's cholera prevention inoculation certificate is the same as last year, and the validity period is three months. In the past, there have been cases of private transfer of such certificates. This year, the authorities will strictly supervise this, and those who violate the regulations printed on the certificate will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Exemptions from Inoculation</p>
<p>The standard dosage for inoculation is as follows: Adults 1.0 cc, 10 to 15 years old 0.5 cc, 7 to 10 years old 0.3 cc, under 7 years old 0.2 cc. The following persons may be exempted from inoculation and issued a certificate, but the certificate must be stamped with "Exempted from Inoculation," and the detailed reasons must be recorded and reported to this bureau: A, Infants under one year old. B, Those with beriberi, heart disease, or kidney disease with edema, but must have a doctor's certificate to be exempted from inoculation. C, Pregnant women (especially in the early stages of pregnancy, three to four months). D, Others whom the doctor deems unsuitable for inoculation. To prevent liability arising from inoculation, doctors must have medications such as cardiotonics prepared in advance.</p>
<h3>Forging of Ration Card Case; Perpetrators Sentenced</h3>

<p>Travel Report</p>
<h3>Governor Hao Pengju Discusses Welcoming Factories to Relocate to Huaihai; Travelogue of Huaihai, Part 3</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>The prerequisite for all administrative reforms is a solid economic foundation and public order. Regarding this point, Governor Hao Pengju said: "Huaihai Province's economy is based on agricultural production. Wheat is the main crop, with an annual output of 1,087,245 tons. Soybeans have an annual output of 288,365 tons, mung beans have an annual output of 46,670 tons, and sorghum has an annual output of 219,029 tons. Sugarcane has an annual output of 725,634 tons. These are all very important. Taking wheat as an example, three crops can be harvested in two years, with a yield of 500 jin per mu. Although Huaihai has a continental climate, it is moderated by the marine climate, so it can have a good harvest. The annual surplus grain is about 500,000 tons. Therefore, the rural economy is still good, and the farmers' lives are quite wealthy. The taxes they pay to the government account for only 4 to 7 percent of their total income.</p>
<p>"In terms of prices, they are about half the price compared to the northern and southern provinces. The provincial government's policy of suppressing prices is to use political power to unite merchants and purchasing people together, so Huaihai's prices have not soared. In short, Huaihai Province's economy is very stable. In fact, it can be described as 'rich people and poor officials.'</p>
<p>"In terms of public order, although Huaihai is in a difficult environment, it has maintained public order and has not deteriorated. In terms of defense works, more than 1,170 large and small strongholds have been built. There are tens of thousands of well-trained troops stationed in the strongholds. With their excellent quality, they can fight against the enemy at a ratio of one to six. The military supplies industry is also very developed. Clothing, equipment, leather, military food, and equipment repair can all be self-sufficient. There are also thorough arrangements for communication construction. Recently, to implement the legal warfare system, a general mobilization of manpower, material resources, and spirit has been implemented, so that every person and every thing in Huaihai can meet the needs of the war. In terms of air defense, in addition to air raid shelters built everywhere, Xuzhou City has also organized a police defense corps. The members of the corps are selected by merchants and civilians themselves and strictly trained. The total number is about ten thousand. In addition, there are nearly a thousand firefighters, divided into ten teams. Therefore, the public order of Huaihai can be said to be stable."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of dispersing Shanghai's industries to Huaihai Province, Hao expressed his great welcome. He replied:</p>
<p>"As the war approaches the decisive stage, the industries in Shanghai and along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, although they have complete equipment, are suffering due to a lack of raw materials, power restrictions, high labor costs, and transportation obstacles. However, in the newly born Huaihai Province, these are not problems:</p>
<p>"Raw Materials: Huaihai Province is naturally endowed with abundant agricultural products, as mentioned earlier. The minerals buried underground are even more astonishing, comparable to the Ukraine in Russia. The main ones are valuable phosphate rock (produced in Haizhou) and iron, manganese, sand, mica, coal, etc. The water fruits include pears, grapes, pomegranates, etc. Therefore, wineries, canneries, oil mills, tanneries, glass factories, and alcohol factories are most suitable for relocating to our province.</p>
<p>"Power: Huaihai produces abundant coal, and the coal produced by the Liquan and Gushan coal mines can be supplied in large quantities. There is a power station in Liquan, and the electricity is sufficient to supply the needs of factories throughout Huaihai Province. Therefore, electricity is not a problem.</p>
<p>"Labor: Huaihai Province is located between central and northern China, governing two cities (Xuzhou and Haizhou) and twenty counties, with a population of about 13 million. Because of the low cost of living, labor costs are very low, and there are many strong young men. Currently, there are few factories in our province. If a large number of factories move to Huaihai, there will be no labor problems. The only thing is that technical training needs to be strengthened.</p>
<p>"Recently, our province has established an 'Industrial Development Association,' which is jointly run by the government and merchants. The main task is to assist in the development of industry. If the factory owners have insufficient capital, this agency can assist in subsidizing 40% of the total capital. If the factories on the Nanjing-Shanghai line are dispersed to Huaihai, this agency can be fully responsible for assistance in terms of transportation, capital, factory site, labor, and fuel." At this point, the topic turned to the provincial government's construction policy. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Wang Maoting, the Main Culprit in the Gambling Den Case, Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment; Verdict Announced Yesterday in the Russian Emigrant Association Gambling Den Case</h3>
<p>The Xincheng Police Station cracked a gambling den in the Russian Emigrant Association at No. 147 Weihaiwei Road on February 24th of this year. Wang Maoting, Han Huaqing, Li Xiulan, Ping Fugeng, and other 32 people were arrested, along with more than a hundred gamblers, and were all transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. Except for the gamblers, who were all given a fine of 5,000 yuan each, the other 32 people, including Wang Maoting, were all prosecuted according to the law. The case was tried by Yin Gongjia, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the District Court, on the 12th of this month. The final verdict was announced yesterday: Wang Maozu was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for gathering a crowd to gamble, and one year and six months of imprisonment for bribery, to be served for two years. Han Huaqing was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The remaining 30 employees of the gambling den, including Li Xiulan and Ping Danggen, were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 2,000 yuan. The imprisonment can be commuted to a fine of 15 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Lao Zha Branch Bureau Cracks Gambling Den</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities, in order to thoroughly eliminate gambling, resolutely closed the gambling dens in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts. However, the bad guys are still trying to revive and disperse their activities, secretly setting up gambling dens in the central area or opening rooms in hotels, gathering people to gamble, which is illegal. The authorities have cracked down on several places, including the "Russian Emigrant Association" and South Chongqing Road. The Lao Zha Branch Bureau, because there are many public places in the area under its jurisdiction, where gambling is inevitable, decided to take vigorous measures to ban and crack down on gambling. It ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation. It was found that a certain public official opened Room 435 in the Jie Shi Hotel on Yunnan Road, gathering people to gamble, with very frequent traffic, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan a day. Xu Minshou, the director of the branch bureau, personally led Deputy Director Sato, Third Section Chief Song Bingzheng, police officers Feng Xiushan, and detectives Xian Zhongming and others to the above-mentioned location at about 9:00 PM on the night before (the 18th). They first surrounded the entire fourth floor and then broke into the room, where more than a hundred gamblers were caught in the act of gambling. The gambling tools and gambling money were confiscated and taken to the bureau for investigation. Yesterday, Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government ordered that the case be handled in accordance with the "Russian Emigrant Association" gambling den case. All the gamblers were released on bail, and the owners, staff, and hotel tea servants were all remanded and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Before the gamblers were released on bail, Xu Minshou, the director of the branch bureau, gave them a detailed lecture, explaining the authorities' intention to ban gambling, and warned them that there must be no similar behavior again, otherwise, they would be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Bicycle License Fees by the Finance Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has re-adjusted the fee rates for various vehicle licenses. The following is a list of bicycle license fees:</p>
<p>New Registration: Registration fee 750 yuan, license fee 100 yuan, license plate fee 375 yuan (the above is administrative income on behalf of the Bureau of Construction), license stamp 600 yuan, small license plate fee 100 yuan, totaling 1.925 yuan.</p>
<p>Lost License: Lost license fee 300 yuan, license plate fee 375 yuan, inspection and stamp fee 80 yuan (the above is administrative income on behalf of the Bureau of Construction), license stamp fee 600 yuan, small license plate fee 100 yuan, totaling 1.455 yuan.</p>
<p>For the above items, except for the receipts issued for administrative income on behalf of the Bureau of Construction, for the license stamp fee and small license plate fee collected by the Finance Bureau, because the bureau's regulations stipulate the use of stamps, only the amounts are noted separately on the vehicle license, and stamped as proof, without issuing separate receipts.</p>
