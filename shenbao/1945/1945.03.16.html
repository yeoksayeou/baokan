<p>東京十五日中央社電　硫黄島戰事，十三日終日異常熾烈，敵軍攻聲重點，依然在北地區日軍陣地，敵不以砲擊及火燄放射器戰東進攻，而以使用空中炸雷，日軍守備部隊對此優勢敵軍之重壓，死守據點，奮勇應戰。十三日下午八時，兩軍對峙，與十三日黄昏無甚變化，日軍守備隊時自據點出動襲擊敵軍，予以重大損害。同時，敵軍對日軍之肉搏突擊，警戒頗嚴，十三日上午，進犯北地區南面之敵軍戰車，於日軍陣地前方百米附近放射火燄，開始前進。天山方面，十三日晨以來，擁有火燄放射器戰車三輛之敵軍，企圖侵入日軍陣地，與日守軍展開激戰。又十二日北地區方面戰事，日軍收獲之戰果爲：艘敵三百，毀飛機一架，是日僅北地區一帶，敵軍損失即達八百五十餘名。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地十五日中央社電　敵對硫黄島北部之砲繫，至十三日更形熾烈，而敵運輸船巳接近該島北地區，該日午後敵乃開始全而進攻，諸方刻正展開激戰中。北部方面之敵有力部隊，于戰車十數輛之掩護下，並以火燄放射器進攻日軍陣地。又天山方面之敵部隊，干戰車數輛掩護之下，來製日軍陣地，嗣經激戰後，卒遭日軍擊退。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日澈底疏散都市人口 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　政府鑒於空襲激烈化及戰局之推移，更强化東京及其他各大都市之防衛，並爲促進確立決戰體制，由於防衛食糧諸對策見地，對各重要都市急速斷行澈底之疏散。十五日於臨時閣議之際，曾討論强化大都市疏散要綱案，由大達內相說明後，當即決定，是日由情報局發表，按該要綱重點，在於日本內地各重要都市之人員疏散，使之澈底分散於各地，轉向於地方生產方面。</p>

<h3 id="c7">洞庭山調查記（三） <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>（二）鄕民因謀生不易，紛紛將住屋折除，將本料磚瓦，運蘇銷售。致全鎭殘骸斷垣，觸目皆是。此風現雖稍殺，然房屋已折除大半。至東山房租頗廉，三開間平房，月租約千元，惜外來人不易租得。房主與房客間之租貿契約，定期者甚少。目下受蘇州之影響，新租戶亦有按米納租者。</p>
<p>（三）洞庭山除住房已折毀半數外，樹木亦遭浩刦，各地較大樹木已被鋸截一空，現僅餘樹根。致各山皆牛山濯濯，來年本山菓木出產，前途堪處。目前當地柴薪價格，亦漸高漲。</p>
<p>（四）當地居民，頭腦陳腐，漠視科學，產婦臨褥，仍延舊式收生婆。前山之『東山保安醫院』由鄕紳葉振民氏捐設百名免費產婦額，迄今半戰，全山僅有七名產婦到院。又當地鄉民什九患有瘧疾；嬰孩及兒童亦多患此病，俗稱「胎瘧」，迷信傳統說法，仍其自然，不肯就醫，致兒童喪命者甚多。兼之當地醫院藥品缺乏，臨急每多措手不及，前此發生腦膜炎，及霍亂等時疫，當時以藥品過少，不敷分配，致死亡者甚多。</p>
<p>一般物價　物價除米外，其他物品亦在逐步高升中，尤以麵粉食油上漲程度最速。茲將本月八日當地各種物價，舉列如後：</p>
<p>麵粉每斤五百元（七日爲三百六十元），豆油每市斤一三六〇元（九日每斤又漲二十元），赤豆每升四百元，鹽每市斤四百元，茅柴每擔一千元，硬柴一千三百元（皆係柴秤計十八兩），豬肉鷄肉每斤一千二百元（二十兩老秤），青菜·菠菜每斤三百元，韮菜四百元（外來品），黄豆芽二百四十元，蝦魚六百元，鷄蛋五十元，鴨蛋七十元。肥皂每塊二百四十元，洋燭每支八百元，火柴小匣七十元。</p>
<p>綜觀上列各種物價，燃料食糧菜蔬均較滬市爲廉，日用品則較滬市高</p>
<p>治安金融　太湖盜匪，素稱猖獗。而洞庭山治安則在友邦警備隊之坐鎮下，又以當地人士善於應付，年來常地治安情形尙佳，並無重大事件之發生，居民亦能安居樂業，可見事在人爲也。</p>
<p>事變前當地有江蘇銀行。中國興業銀行及永和錢莊，惜事變後皆收歇。又負有調濟貧民生計使命之典當，原有源源。崇德兩家，後因二十六年亂兵過境，每多强當，致虧本倒閉，現僅有變相之押當舊貨店數家，重利剝削貧民。目下洞庭山商民最感困難者，即現鈔缺乏，不能大量進貨，又如各方米商前來交易，皆要現鈔，拒收支票（泰半蘇州方面者），故米糧購運，未能圓滑，此亦當地糧食每易發生恐慌之又一原因也。</p>
<p>敎育現況　東山計有完全小學三所，初級小學七所，西山僅縣立之初級小學一所，中學兩山均無。各校經費，私校皆賴旅滬紳商之捐助，如務本小學爲葉振民葉樂天等捐款興辦</p>
<p>縣立小學學費，低級爲每學期四百五十元，高級六百元，書籍費用品雜費低級五百元，高級一千五百元，此外並徴獻米金一千元。私校學費連書籍費等，高級共五千元，中級四千</p>
<p>以學費昻貴，鄕民大都不能遣其子弟入學，致造成多數兒童之失學。當記者旅行各山時，每見林中有大批兒童看羊採薪，據調查當地之學齡兒童的有八千餘人，現入學者祗一千六百人（今歲入學兒童已增三分之一），以學校單位論，事變前學生最多者爲縣立之文昌（七百人），現爲私立</p>
<p>至敎員待遇，縣立學校之新預算，尙未實施，以文昌一校言，目前敎員底薪爲一百三四十元，照十五倍計算，祗兩千餘元。按諸事實，每一敎員之生活，每月每人食米消耗最少須兩斗，連蔬菜費七千元，最低生活費在一萬四千元左右，進益與支出相差竟達七倍之鉅。故後山小學敎員，實行輪流每日至各學生家中用膳藉資補助。私立學校敎員待遇較佳，以務本論，據該校校長馮志亮氏語記者，上學期務本敎員之修束，最高八千元，最低爲四千元，本學期已增至兩萬左右，此數較諸縣立學校之兩千元实不可同日而語矣。</p>
<p>因待遇之菲薄，故師資亦隨之降低，普通敎員僅初中畢業，而主任亦僅高中程度，甚至小學畢業者已担任小學三四年級之敎師，至後山之私塾，自更不堪聞部矣。</p>
<p>當地之敎育機關，有「東山旅滬同鄕會」組織之貸學金委員會，全山學生總數十分之一，由該會補助，餘則由殷富紳商私人捐助。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c17">歡迎任省長 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>——六團體歡迎會演說詞——</p>
<p>今天上海市民福利協會等六團體歡迎江蘇省任省長曁以次各高級長官，情緒熱烈，從此可以反映官民之間的團結精神。任省長是江蘇人，現在的省政府又在蘇州，我個人更以蘇州旅滬同鄉會副理事長的資格，表示格外的歡迎</p>
<p>任省長過去久任中樞海軍部長，及陸軍第一方面軍總司令，現在主持江蘇省政，同時兼綰治安，憑其以往在軍政方面的經騐，爲桑梓服務，定能發揮最高效能。誠如剛才主席李贊侯先生說過：「任省長軍政兼綰，文武全才，職權統一，在運用上比較能收一元之效。」確是最允當的觀察。</p>
<p>上海市在地域上是屬於江蘇省範圍以內的，雖則在行政上劃分區域，可是，在地理上是分不開的。因此，在經濟上更是不可分開的。換言之，江蘇省與上海市在經濟上有着相互間的依存關係，彼此都不能分離獨立。例如上海是工商都市，祗有工業生產與商業貿易，而沒有農業生產，尤其是糧食生產。所以，在上海從事工商業者就須依賴江蘇省的農業生產。一方面，江蘇省的大部分農業區需要日用的工業品，也須依賴上海供給。這就是江蘇省與上海市在經濟上相互依存關係的說明。</p>
<p>上海市與江蘇省的經濟關係旣然如此密切，那末，自應各盡所能，彼此交換。可是，現在上海的工業生產陷於停滯狀態中，而同時又感到糧食的恐慌，很顯著的在江蘇省與上海市之間，未能在經濟上盡其應有的交換任務。因此，在相互依存的關係上未免脫了節，彼此都感到苦悶。不過，上海市民並不是偸懶，不從事生產，而實際上都希望從工作與生產中，能換得最低限度的糧食，以資生活。這是希望任省長在職權範圍內盡可能帮助的第一點。</p>
<p>目前上海的工業生產停滯，物價飛漲，大部份薪工階級旣感到失業痛苦，復受生活重担的威脅。同時，上海又是戰時後方的重要基地，今後受敵機空襲的威脅，是很可能的事。在這種種的因素下，凡是不必要居留上海者，應即疏散，尤其如養老福幼等慈善機關，更在强制疏散之列。上海市府方面已經組織疏散委員會，積極進行，但在這方面需要江蘇省政府協助之處極爲殷切。例如指定若干地區爲疏散地點，以距離鐵路綫相當里程，而非軍事要衝地帶者爲宜。又如疏散交通綫沿途治安之確立，尤其是沿途軍警檢查如檢問所等，均須特別予以便利。這是希望任省長充分予以協助的第二點。</p>
<p>爲實現以上兩點，並促成今後的密切聯繋，我們建議江蘇省政府與上海市政府之間，設一經常的聯絡機構，相互懇談，對於省市之間一切官民互利工作，合作問題，通過這個機構而達到完滿解決。</p>
<p>其次，我們也希望。上海工商界人士，認識時代環境的推移，應即考慮在江蘇省區各縣投資，創設各種日用品小型工廠，一方面安置失業工人，一方面保持本身事業，爲將來恢復基礎打算。至於設廠地點，當地治安等等，當然請求省府協助與負責。</p>
<p>昨天任省長發表談話，對於敎育事業特別重視，他說：「與共多編軍隊，不如多辦學校，爲民族之將來計，亂世之從政者，尤應苦心爲之，」誠是語重心長。同時，袁廳長主持江蘇省敎育行政，已經多年，成績斐然，最近更得任省長的重視，是則今後蘇省敎育，必有長足進步。我們希望對於疏散離滬的各級學生，在人學試騐及學費方面均予特別優容。同時，對於上海的大學及專門學校疏散問題，也予以切實的協助。</p>
<p>最後，我更覺欣慰，昨天曾晤任省長叩教，任省長對於南京上海與蘇省三方面，在政治經濟措施上，主張應保持水平綫的平均發展，而不能形成曲綫的發展，發生彼此不能協調的畸形現象。現在南京中樞由陳代主席主持刷新，上海由周市長羅秘書長積極整飭，蘇省方面已經聽到任省長的抱負。我們相信不久的將來，定能做成政治經濟模範區的地步。</p>

<p>東京十四日中央社電　十三日夜迄十四日拂曉，來襲大阪地區之敵機，經日軍制空部隊邀擊後，如大本營所發表，計擊落其十一架，擊毀其六十架，及來襲敵機總數之八成，共計七十一架。敵機於十日夜襲東京，十二日襲名古屋，以及此次來襲大阪，共三度實施夜間轟炸，其機數已達三百五十架，其中被日軍制空部隊擊落五十二架，佔一成四分，擊毀百六十架，佔四成八分，由此可知敵機於三次夜襲中所受損失，實占總數百分之六十三。</p>

<h3 id="c20">六團昨茶會　歡迎任省長　出席二千餘人情緒熱烈 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>本市市商會·市政諮詢委員會·市民福利協會·中國新聞協會上海區分會·慈善團曁蘇州旅滬同鄕會等六團體，聯合舉行茶會，歡迎江蘇省任省長，於昨（十五）日下午四時半假金門飯店舉行。主人方面到有李思浩·袁腹登·間蘭亭·林康侯·麗子漁·陳彬龢等。主賓任省長偕間黃參謀長，財政廳長裴復恒，敎育聽長袁殊，建設應長孫育才，高局長鶴飛，省銀行任西萍總理等準時蒞會。各界來賓計劃到市羅秘書長，曁各局處長蘇成德·許江·袁濬昌·戴英夫·徐季敦·周毓英·劉德煊·滿其蔚·李時雨·顧綱武等。各界名流到有葉扶書·趙正平·黃金榮·襲雲卿·陳日平·沈嗣良·潘三省·項康原·鮑國昌·符前耕·劉仰山·姜西園·陳國權·何焯賢·周邦俊·陳紹嬀·陳亞夫·吳庸庵·黃雨齋等，及各業代表何五良·宋卓哉·崔世富·姚文俊等不下二千餘人。行禮如儀後，首由主席團代表李思浩歡迎詞，繼由林康侯代表獻贈紀念大銀杯，當由任省長親自接受後，即席致詞，表示大感謝與協力上海各種問題之決心。旋請市府羅秘書長與中國新聞協會上海區分會理事長陳彬龢分別演說畢（陳氏演詞見第一版代論），末進茶點，於六進許如吿散會，茲分誌演詞如後：</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席李國浩致詞：「任省長，各位蘇省長官，各們來賓，今天上海六團體歡迎江蘇省任省長曁各位高級長官，承蒙光臨，同人很爲欣幸。江蘇省與上海市，雖左行政上分爲兩個區域，可是，在地域上言，上海市是包括在江蘇省範團以內的，在上海市以外，四周都是江蘇省所屬的行政區域，所以，上海市民可以說，同時也是江蘇省的老百姓。因爲有這樣的唇齒關係，上海市民就特別希望江蘇省政治的淸明，足以促進與配合上海市政府的淸明，所以，我們對於任省長及以次各負責長官，表示深切的期待。</p>
<p>任省長於去年十一月間，由海軍部長轉任江蘇省長，同時，兼任綏靖主任及第一方面軍總司令，可說是軍政兼綰，文武全才，職權統一，在運用上比較能收一元之效。我們希望任省長對於上海市民與江蘇省人民同樣看待，對於上海市民所需要協助的地方，如最近本市舉辦疏散人口工作以及最迫切的糧食問題，尤盼充分協助，謹此代表上海市民表示歡迎，並祝任省長以及各位長官健康。」</p>
<p>任省長詞</p>
<p>略謂今日承本市六團體茶會招待，愧不敢當。本人蒞任數月，早擬來滬向各方領袖請益，並對蘭心蘇省政情者有所報吿，昨抵滬後承陳彬龢先生惠臨晤談，因將江蘇省政設施概况，扼要發表，已見今日申報及新聞報，尙希各方指正。茲再將比較重要的幾點，簡單申述，以就敎於在座諸君：</p>
<p>關於治安問題，本人向遵國府和平反共建國國策，數年來一貫實行，蘇省境內所謂共軍力量，實際上甚爲薄弱，除六合北方盤眠小股新四軍外，此外二十三縣地方之武裝共軍爲數極小，並無正式作戰能力，省府正密切防範以期確立治安，此點實不足慮。</p>
<p>財政方面，田賦征實除游擊區爲無碍外，大體上成績雖尙不十分理想，然省庫事實上已比較過去盈收百分之三十至四十，與預定目標相差不遠</p>
<p>敎育與秤建設，爲蘇省府之施政重點。本人旣負全省行政責任，以爲與其多練兵，不如多辦學校。生產建設爲戰時重要工作，決負責做去，不徒尙表面。最近已利用蘇嘉路之一段荒蕪路基，闢爲農田，計得四千八百畝之多，乃以極低限度之人力與財力所從事而完成者。關於公路建設，擬先在蘇滬之間，開闢公路三條，以利運輸交通，惟經費相當浩大，約需十萬萬至二十萬萬元，此事省府當與滬市府聯絡進行。</p>
<p>最後關於生活方面，尤其爲公務員之生活，在戰時自較窘困，但本人以公務員於自己本位職務上，應理頭苦幹，而以生活問題之解決委諸上級長官，如是方可提高服務精神，蘇省府同人決本此原則做去。以上一得之愚，尙祈各方明敎。</p>
<p>羅秘長詞</p>
<p>略謂今日抱病出席歡迎任省長盛會，殊感欣幸。茲將本人感想，略陳一二：即　過去官塲積習，省市政府或各機關問頗多界限不相問聞，即中央與地方政府間在主張及設施上亦儘多此種現象，無庸爲諱。任省長蘇省府諸長官，周市長·及本人各負地方之責任，決不因要域不同而有此種觀念，不分中央與地方在一個體系下，猶手足四肢與腦神經之關係，協同運用，無所隔閡。　因人事方面及時代環境關係，滬蘇兩地恍如一家，蘇省府與滬市府間實應有非常良好的聯緊存在，從上海市府立塲說，更應要求蘇省府之切實帮忙協力。　目下其尤關重要者即人口疏散與食糧補充兩點，希望蘇省府作無限度的協助，俾滬市府得完成其應做之工作。　最後本人對於任省長之政治感想：於反共一點，毫無疑問的同意。本人覺得反共應澈底的做，勿使其黨利用機會，在夾縫中滋長，對有形的—武裝共黨，固當戒備，而無形的—文化思想方面，亦應加以肅淸，此種責任，實爲全市市民與政府應所共負者，尤其是社會上的領袖分子，責無旁貸，蓋反共在我國爲應永久注意的重要問題，願大家在同一步調及決心，達到此期望。</p>

<h3 id="c21">白俄警察防空班　昨行檢閱禮　周市長躬臨主持 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>本市警察局爲强化防空體制，特以白俄人員編制爲警察總隊之第四隊防空班，由總隊長塜崎正敏兼任隊長，常駐靜安寺路跑馬廳內，積極加以訓練，業經熟練，於十五日下午二時半在跑馬內舉行首次檢閱典禮。由周市長兼警察局長躬親主持，到有日陸軍司令官勝野實，上海憲兵隊長四方諒二，淸鄕事務局長蘇成德，市宣傳處長劉德煊，以及該局副局長渡正監，虛英，各處正副處長正副科長，各分局局長，各服主任，防空本部各處長，各科長，名保甲區部聯保長，警防團長，保甲防空團等數千餘人。</p>
<p>檢視器具</p>
<p>周市長先由第二處平崗勇處長，警察部隊長塜崎正敏等陪同檢視各項防空必需用具，並由塜崎對各種用具，詳加報吿其用途。繼而檢閱典禮開始，由平罔處長致詞，繼塜崎隊長任總指揮，命令第四隊隊員全體出動，當由紅色車五輛裝載隊員及防空器具，自外駛入塲內，而於塲中之一角建築物中燃放鞭砲，假想着彈起火，內部罹災，一時烟火彌漫</p>
<p>訓練情形</p>
<p>防空班到塲，先作被炸塲之視察，警戒兵之配置，防空監視哨之報吿後，當全體出動，先將堆塞之道路開啓，四週因假想炸斷之電綫，先由技術人員迅速收抬處理，消防隊員紛奔至火災塲，運用軟梯爬上屋頂，提筒傳遞，奮力將火撲滅。繼而再運用繩索，將樓上之罹難者救出。於各項工作推進中，又得到防空監視哨警報敵機來襲，全員即撲地待避，旋認爲投下彈係瓦斯彈，全員實施向上風再待避，待監視哨報吿敵機西去，全員即在另一屋之假想中彈而急救之，並將中毒者又運用繩索等法救出施行應急手術，繼之新成分局騐屍局到塲騐屍，同時開始担保架演習，周市長在司令官上檢閱，各隊員極爲純熟。</p>
<p>分別行進</p>
<p>再舉行分列行進，全員分五班，先由檢閱官檢閱後，即分別行進，精神抖擻，步伐齊整，繼而警察總隊第二隊之暴動鎭壓訓練，紅色警備車四輛裝載警察隊員由外駛入塲中，分別停止，各隊員出塲排列，作各種鎭壓之訓練，最後該隊所屬之警察音樂隊行進，至四時許始畢</p>

<h3 id="c25">人民敬畏 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>蘇北綏靖主任孫良誠將軍，昨日招待本市各界曁蘇北同鄕。本年一月十九日本報社評會對孫氏深致期勉。蘇北環境特殊，地位重要，因此，蘇北軍政成爲比賽優劣最尖銳化的區域，也就是爭取民心緊熱烈的區域。怎麼說呢？蘇北是和平地區，蘇北軍政如果辦得好，辦得比各方面好，則不但樹立北人民一致的信仰，而且足以影響別的利平區域非辦好不可。同時，土匪雜軍在優勝劣敗的原則下，無法競爭，這是當局最應重視的問題，也是孫氏最大的任和。我們相信中樞當局選任孫氏主持蘇北軍政者，也因責任艱鉅，而非以廉明有爲如孫氏者不足當此。</p>
<p>蘇北同鄕代表致詞中，希望孫氏做到「敬畏」兩字，含意極深，並不是說孫氏應敬民畏民，而是說：「好的人要對之敬重，壞的人要對之畏懼」，這是最高的行政效率。</p>
<p>我們很同意這個意見，不但希望孫氏做到，更希望和平區內軍政負責者都應做到，這個時候也就是政治眞正淸明的時候了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The National Domestic Public Bond of the 34th Year of the Republic of China to be Issued in Installments by the Ministry of Finance; The National Government Specifically Formulates Regulations and Publicly Promulgates Them <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The National Government (March 14th, 34th year of the Republic of China) issued an order promulgating the Regulations for the National Domestic Public Bond of the 34th Year of the Republic of China. This order was given by Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo, Premier of the Executive Yuan Chen Gongbo, and President of the Legislative Yuan Liang Hongzhi.</p>
<p>Regulations for the National Domestic Public Bond of the 34th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Article 1: This public bond is named the National Domestic Public Bond of the 34th Year of the Republic of China, and is used to increase production, strengthen public security, and regulate finance.</p>
<p>Article 2: The total amount of this public bond is set at 2,000,000,000,000 National Currency Units (dollars), to be issued by the Ministry of Finance and undertaken or raised by the Central Reserve Bank.

<h3 id="e3">Fierce Fighting Continues in the Northern Region of Iwo Jima; Japanese Garrison Units Launch Raids and Inflict Damage on the Enemy <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On Iwo Jima, fighting was exceptionally intense throughout the 13th. The main focus of enemy attacks remained the Japanese positions in the northern region. Instead of relying on artillery fire and flamethrowers, the enemy used aerial bombs. The Japanese garrison units, facing this overwhelming enemy pressure, tenaciously defended their strongholds and fought bravely. At 8:00 PM on the 13th, the situation remained unchanged from dusk, with the two sides locked in a stalemate. Japanese garrison units occasionally launched raids from their positions, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. The enemy was also heavily guarded against Japanese close-quarters combat attacks. On the morning of the 13th, enemy tanks advancing towards the southern face of the northern region opened fire with flamethrowers near Japanese positions, approximately 100 meters away, and began to advance. On the Motoyama front, enemy tanks equipped with flamethrowers attempted to penetrate Japanese positions from the morning of the 13th, leading to fierce fighting with the Japanese garrison. Furthermore, the results of the fighting in the northern region on the 12th were: over three hundred enemy soldiers killed, one aircraft destroyed. On that day, in the northern region alone, enemy losses reached over eight hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy artillery fire against the northern part of Iwo Jima intensified on the 13th, and enemy transport ships approached the northern region of the island. In the afternoon, the enemy launched a full-scale attack, and fierce fighting is currently underway on all fronts. Powerful enemy units in the northern sector, under the cover of a dozen tanks, advanced on Japanese positions with flamethrowers. Enemy units on the Motoyama front, covered by several tanks, also launched an attack on Japanese positions, but were eventually repulsed by the Japanese garrison after fierce fighting.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Investigation Report on Dongting Mountain (3) <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>(2) Because it is difficult for villagers to make a living, they have dismantled their houses one after another, transporting the timber, bricks, and tiles to Suzhou for sale. As a result, the whole town is full of ruins and broken walls. Although this trend has slowed down slightly, most of the houses have already been demolished. Rent in Dongshan is quite cheap; a three-room house rents for about 1,000 yuan per month, but it is not easy for outsiders to rent. There are very few fixed-term lease agreements between landlords and tenants. Under the influence of Suzhou, some new tenants are paying rent in rice.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to the fact that half of the houses in Dongting Mountain have been demolished, the trees have also suffered a catastrophe. Most of the larger trees in various places have been sawn down, leaving only the roots. As a result, the mountains are all bare. The future prospects for fruit production are bleak. At present, the price of firewood is also gradually increasing.</p>
<p>(4) The local residents are antiquated in their thinking and disregard science. When women are about to give birth, they still rely on old-fashioned midwives. The "Dongshan Security Hospital" in the former mountain, established by local gentry Ye Zhenmin, offered one hundred free maternity slots, but to date, only seven pregnant women from the whole mountain have gone to the hospital. Furthermore, nineteen out of ten local villagers suffer from malaria; infants and children also often suffer from this disease, commonly known as "fetal malaria," believing in traditional sayings, they leave it to nature and refuse to seek medical treatment, resulting in the deaths of many children. In addition, local hospitals lack medicine, and are often caught off guard in emergencies. Previously, when epidemics such as meningitis and cholera occurred, many people died because there were too few medicines to be distributed.</p>
<p>General Prices: In addition to rice, the prices of other goods are also gradually rising, especially flour and cooking oil, which have risen the fastest. The local prices of various goods on the 8th of this month are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Flour: 500 yuan per catty (360 yuan on the 7th), soybean oil: 1,360 yuan per market catty (rose another 20 yuan per catty on the 9th), adzuki beans: 400 yuan per liter, salt: 400 yuan per market catty, thatch: 1,000 yuan per dan, hardwood: 1,300 yuan (both calculated on a chai scale of 18 taels), pork and chicken: 1,200 yuan per catty (20 taels old scale), green vegetables and spinach: 300 yuan per catty, chives: 400 yuan (imported), soybean sprouts: 240 yuan, shrimp and fish: 600 yuan, chicken eggs: 50 yuan, duck eggs: 70 yuan. Soap: 240 yuan per bar, candles: 800 yuan per stick, small box of matches: 70 yuan.</p>
<p>Overall, the prices of fuel, food, and vegetables listed above are cheaper than those in Shanghai, while the prices of daily necessities are higher than those in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Public Security and Finance: The bandits of Taihu Lake have always been rampant. However, under the stationing of friendly allied security forces in Dongting Mountain, and because the local people are good at coping, the public security situation in the region has been relatively good in recent years, and there have been no major incidents. Residents have been able to live and work in peace, which shows that it is all a matter of human effort.</p>
<p>Before the incident, there were Jiangsu Bank, China Xingye Bank, and Yonghe Money Shop in the area, but they all closed down after the incident. In addition, the pawnshops, which had the mission of regulating the livelihoods of the poor, originally had Yuanyuan and Chongde. Later, due to the passage of undisciplined soldiers in the 26th year (of the Republic of China, 1937), there were many forced pawnings, resulting in losses and closures. Now there are only a few old-fashioned pawnshops that operate in disguise, exploiting the poor with high interest rates. Currently, the most difficult thing for merchants in Dongting Mountain is the lack of cash, which prevents them from importing goods in large quantities. Furthermore, when rice merchants from all over come to trade, they all require cash and refuse to accept checks (mostly from Suzhou), so the purchase and transportation of grain is not smooth. This is also another reason why food shortages easily occur in the area.</p>
<p>Current Education: Dongshan has three complete primary schools and seven junior primary schools, while Xishan has only one county-run junior primary school. There are no middle schools in either mountain. The funding for the schools, especially private schools, relies on donations from gentry and merchants living in Shanghai. For example, Wuben Primary School was established with donations from Ye Zhenmin, Ye Letian, and others.</p>
<p>The tuition fee for county-run primary schools is 450 yuan per semester for lower grades and 600 yuan for higher grades. The cost of books, supplies, and miscellaneous fees is 500 yuan for lower grades and 1,500 yuan for higher grades. In addition, a rice donation of 1,000 yuan is collected. The tuition fee for private schools, including books, etc., is 5,000 yuan for higher grades and 4,000 yuan for middle grades.</p>
<p>Due to the high cost of tuition, most villagers cannot afford to send their children to school, resulting in a large number of children dropping out of school. When this reporter traveled to various mountains, I often saw large groups of children herding sheep and collecting firewood. According to surveys, there are more than 8,000 school-age children in the area, but only 1,600 are currently enrolled (the number of children enrolled this year has increased by one-third). In terms of school units, the school with the most students before the incident was the county-run Wenchang (700 students), and now it is a private school.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of teachers, the new budget for county-run schools has not yet been implemented. Taking Wenchang School as an example, the current base salary for teachers is 130-140 yuan, which is only over 2,000 yuan when calculated at 15 times. In fact, the minimum rice consumption for each teacher is at least two dou per month, plus 7,000 yuan for vegetable expenses, for a minimum living cost of about 14,000 yuan, with a difference of seven times between income and expenditure. Therefore, primary school teachers in the back mountains take turns eating meals in the homes of students every day as a subsidy. Private school teachers are treated better. According to Feng Zhiliang, the principal of Wuben School, the maximum salary for Wuben teachers was 8,000 yuan and the minimum was 4,000 yuan last semester, and this semester it has increased to about 20,000 yuan. This number cannot be compared with the 2,000 yuan of county-run schools.</p>
<p>Due to the meager salaries, the quality of teachers has also decreased. Ordinary teachers are only junior high school graduates, and head teachers are only high school graduates. Even elementary school graduates are teaching third and fourth grade students. The private schools in the back mountains are even more unbearable to mention.</p>
<p>The local educational institution has a "Dongshan Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association" scholarship committee, which subsidizes one-tenth of the total number of students in the mountain. The rest is donated by wealthy gentry and merchants. (End)</p>

However, the troop strength in the south will certainly not be as large as that in the north. The US 7th and half of the 3rd Army will likely be the main forces, and units of the French 1st Army may also assist in the battle.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Hai Tong News Agency: Soviet forces yesterday launched a new offensive in East Prussia, deploying seven armies and multiple tank units. Fierce fighting continues in Danzig and Gdynia, but the offensive on the Oder River in front of Stettin and between Küstrin and Frankfurt has slowed down. The focus of the new East Prussian offensive is now northwest of Riechenberg and Neustadt and east of Brandenburg. The offensive launched by Sokolov's troops against the Stettin bridgehead has weakened within 24 hours, and German forces have retaken several key points.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Hai Yong News Agency: Marshal Sokolov has temporarily suspended the fierce attacks on the German bridgehead at Stettin. As of noon on Wednesday, the Soviet army only launched local attacks, which was probably due to excessive damage and the need for reorganization. Sokolov's plan to attack Stettin was to encircle the city from the north and south, but the results were all met with firm resistance. The Soviet army has now moved in a large number of ferries and bridge-building materials, seemingly attempting to establish a bridgehead on the west bank of the Oder River.</p>

<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>——Speech at the Welcome Meeting by Six Organizations——</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association and five other organizations are warmly welcoming Jiangsu Province Governor Ren and other senior officials, which reflects the spirit of unity between officials and the people. Governor Ren is a native of Jiangsu, and the provincial government is now in Suzhou, so I, in my capacity as the vice chairman of the Suzhou Native Place Association in Shanghai, express an extra special welcome.</p>
<p>In the past, Governor Ren served for a long time as the Naval Minister of the central government and the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group. Now, presiding over the administration of Jiangsu Province and concurrently managing public security, he will surely be able to bring his military and political experience to bear in serving his hometown and maximize his effectiveness. As Chairman Li Zanhou said earlier, "Governor Ren is involved in both military and political affairs, is a man of both civil and military talents, and has unified authority, making it possible to achieve unified effectiveness in implementation." This is indeed a very appropriate observation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipality is geographically within the scope of Jiangsu Province. Although administrative regions are divided, they cannot be separated geographically. Therefore, economically, they are even more inseparable. In other words, Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality have an interdependent relationship economically, and neither can be separated and independent. For example, Shanghai is an industrial and commercial city with only industrial production and commercial trade, but without agricultural production, especially grain production. Therefore, those engaged in industry and commerce in Shanghai must rely on the agricultural production of Jiangsu Province. On the other hand, most agricultural areas of Jiangsu Province need daily industrial products and must rely on Shanghai for supply. This is an explanation of the interdependent economic relationship between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality.</p>
<p>Since the economic relationship between Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province is so close, each should do its best to exchange with each other. However, the industrial production in Shanghai is now stagnant, and at the same time, there is a grain shortage. It is very obvious that Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality have failed to fulfill their due exchange responsibilities economically. Therefore, in the interdependent relationship, there is a disconnection, and both feel depressed. However, the citizens of Shanghai are not lazy and unwilling to engage in production. In fact, they all hope to exchange their labor and production for a minimum amount of grain to make a living. This is the first point that we hope Governor Ren will help with as much as possible within his authority.</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai's industrial production is stagnant, and prices are soaring. Most wage earners feel the pain of unemployment and are threatened by the heavy burden of life. At the same time, Shanghai is an important rear base in wartime, and it is very likely to be threatened by enemy air raids in the future. Under these factors, anyone who does not need to stay in Shanghai should be evacuated immediately, especially charitable organizations such as homes for the elderly and children's welfare institutions should be forcibly evacuated. The Shanghai Municipal Government has organized an evacuation committee to actively carry out this work, but in this regard, the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Government is extremely necessary. For example, designate certain areas as evacuation sites, which should be a considerable distance from railway lines and not be in vital military areas. In addition, the establishment of security along evacuation transportation lines, especially the convenience of military and police inspections, such as checkpoints along the way, should be given special attention. This is the second point that we hope Governor Ren will fully assist with.</p>
<p>To realize the above two points and promote close ties in the future, we suggest that a regular liaison organization be established between the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government to discuss matters and cooperate on all matters of mutual benefit for officials and people between the province and the city, and to achieve a satisfactory solution through this organization.</p>
<p>Secondly, we also hope that Shanghai industrialists and businessmen will recognize the changes in the times and consider investing in various counties in Jiangsu Province to establish small factories producing various daily necessities, on the one hand to resettle unemployed workers, and on the other hand to maintain their own businesses and plan for future recovery. As for the location of factories, local security, etc., we will of course request the assistance and responsibility of the provincial government.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Governor Ren made a speech, paying special attention to education, saying: "It is better to run more schools than to organize more troops. For the future of the nation, those in power in troubled times should work hard." These are sincere and earnest words. At the same time, Director Yuan has been in charge of Jiangsu Province's education administration for many years and has achieved outstanding results. Recently, he has gained the attention of Governor Ren, so Jiangsu Province's education will surely make great progress in the future. We hope that special consideration will be given to students at all levels evacuated from Shanghai in terms of admission tests and tuition fees. At the same time, practical assistance should also be given to the evacuation of universities and specialized schools in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finally, I am even more gratified. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet Governor Ren to ask for advice. Governor Ren advocated that Nanjing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Province should maintain an average level of development in terms of political and economic measures, and should not form a curved development, resulting in distorted phenomena that cannot be coordinated with each other. Now the central government in Nanjing is being refreshed under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, Shanghai is being actively reorganized by Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, and we have already heard about Governor Ren's aspirations for Jiangsu Province. We believe that in the near future, it will definitely become a model area for politics and economics.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft that attacked the Osaka area on the night of the 13th until dawn on the 14th were intercepted by Japanese air defense forces. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters, 11 were shot down and 60 were destroyed, accounting for 80% of the total number of attacking enemy aircraft, totaling 71. The enemy aircraft carried out night bombings on Tokyo on the 10th, Nagoya on the 12th, and Osaka this time, totaling 350 aircraft. Among them, 52 were shot down by Japanese air defense forces, accounting for 14%, and 160 were destroyed, accounting for 48%. From this, it can be seen that the losses suffered by enemy aircraft in the three night raids actually accounted for 63% of the total.</p>

Finally, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned at six o'clock. The speeches are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Li Guohao said in his speech: "Governor Ren, distinguished Jiangsu Province officials, guests, today, six organizations in Shanghai are welcoming Jiangsu Province Governor Ren and other senior officials. We are very happy to have you here. Although Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality are divided into two administrative regions, geographically speaking, Shanghai Municipality is included within the scope of Jiangsu Province. Outside Shanghai Municipality, the surrounding areas are all administrative regions under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. Therefore, it can be said that the citizens of Shanghai are also citizens of Jiangsu Province. Because of this close relationship, the citizens of Shanghai especially hope that the political clarity of Jiangsu Province will promote and cooperate with the clarity of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, we express our deep expectations for Governor Ren and other responsible officials.</p>
<p>In November of last year, Governor Ren was transferred from Naval Minister to Governor of Jiangsu Province. At the same time, he also served as the Pacification Director and Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group. It can be said that he is involved in both military and political affairs, is a man of both civil and military talents, and has unified authority, making it possible to achieve unified effectiveness in implementation. We hope that Governor Ren will treat the citizens of Shanghai and the people of Jiangsu Province equally, and give full assistance to the areas where the citizens of Shanghai need assistance, such as the recent work of evacuating the population and the most pressing issue of food. On behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, I extend my welcome and wish Governor Ren and all officials good health."</p>
<p>Governor Ren's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stating that he was unworthy of the hospitality of the six organizations in the city today. Having been in office for several months, I had long planned to come to Shanghai to seek advice from leaders from all walks of life and report on the political situation in Jiangsu Province. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, Mr. Chen Binhe kindly visited me and discussed the general situation of the Jiangsu Province government facilities. I have already published a summary in today's Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao. I hope that all parties will correct me. Now, I will briefly state a few more important points for the education of everyone present:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of public security, I have always followed the national policy of the National Government of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, and have consistently implemented it for several years. The so-called communist military forces within Jiangsu Province are actually very weak. Except for a small group of the New Fourth Army in Panmian, north of Liuhe, the number of armed communist troops in the other 23 counties is extremely small and has no formal combat capability. The provincial government is closely guarding against this in order to establish public security. This point is not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the actual collection of land tax is generally acceptable, except for the guerrilla areas where it is not hindered. Although the results are not very ideal, the provincial treasury has actually increased by 30% to 40% compared to the past, which is not far from the planned target.</p>
<p>Education and construction are the key points of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's policy. I have assumed the overall administrative responsibility of the province. I believe that it is better to run more schools than to train more soldiers. Production and construction are important tasks during wartime, and I am determined to do them responsibly, not just pay lip service. Recently, we have used a section of barren roadbed on the Sujia Road to open up farmland, totaling more than 4,800 mu, which was completed with extremely limited manpower and financial resources. Regarding highway construction, we plan to open three highways between Suzhou and Shanghai first to facilitate transportation. However, the cost is quite large, about 100 million to 200 million yuan. The provincial government will contact the Shanghai Municipal Government to carry out this matter.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding life, especially the life of civil servants, it is naturally more difficult during wartime. However, I believe that civil servants should work hard in their own positions and entrust the solution of livelihood issues to their superiors. This is the only way to improve the spirit of service. The colleagues of the Jiangsu Provincial Government are determined to do so in accordance with this principle. The above is my humble opinion, and I hope that all parties will enlighten me.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stating that I am very happy to attend the welcome meeting for Governor Ren today, despite being ill. I will briefly state one or two of my thoughts: In the past, due to the accumulated habits in the official field, there were many boundaries between provincial and municipal governments or various agencies that did not interfere with each other. That is, there are also many such phenomena in the propositions and facilities between the central and local governments, which is undeniable. Governor Ren and the officials of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Mayor Zhou, and I each bear the responsibility of the local area. We will never have this kind of concept because the region is different. Regardless of the central and local, under one system, it is like the relationship between the limbs and the brain, coordinating and operating without any obstacles. Due to personnel and environmental factors, the two places of Shanghai and Jiangsu are like one family. There should be a very good connection between the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government. From the standpoint of the Shanghai Municipal Government, it should request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to provide practical help and cooperation. At present, the most important points are the evacuation of the population and the replenishment of food. I hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will provide unlimited assistance so that the Shanghai Municipal Government can complete its work. Finally, my political thoughts on Governor Ren: I agree with the anti-communism point without any doubt. I feel that anti-communism should be done thoroughly, and its party should not be allowed to take the opportunity to grow in the cracks. We should be vigilant against the tangible – armed communists, and we should also eliminate the intangible – cultural and ideological aspects. This responsibility should be borne by all citizens and the government, especially the leading figures in the society. It is the permanent important problem that everyone should pay attention to, I wish that everyone could achieve this expectation in the same pace and determination.</p>

<h3 id="e23">White Russian Police Air Defense Team Holds Review Ceremony Yesterday, Mayor Zhou Attends in Person <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the air defense system, the Shanghai Police Bureau specially organized the White Russian personnel into the Fourth Air Defense Team of the Police Corps. The team leader is also the corps leader Tsukazaki Masatoshi, who is stationed in the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road, actively training them. After they have become proficient, the first review ceremony was held at the racecourse at 2:30 p.m. on the 15th. Mayor Zhou, also the Police Chief, presided over the ceremony in person. Those who attended included Japanese Army Commander Katsuno Minoru, Shanghai Gendarmerie Commander Shikata Ryozo, Qingxiang Affairs Bureau Chief Su Chengde, Municipal Propaganda Office Chief Liu Dexuan, as well as Deputy Bureau Chiefs Watarai Masaru and Xu Ying, various department chiefs and deputy chiefs, section chiefs and deputy section chiefs, various branch chiefs, various service chiefs, various chiefs of the air defense headquarters, section chiefs, name-holding Jia District corps leaders, corps leaders, and thousands of other people, including Jia District air defense corps.</p>
<p>Inspection of Equipment</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou first inspected various necessary air defense equipment accompanied by Chief Hiraga Isamu of the Second Section and Police Corps Leader Tsukazaki Masatoshi, and Tsukazaki gave a detailed report on the use of each equipment. Then the review ceremony began. Chief Hiraga gave a speech, followed by Tsukazaki, who acted as the commander-in-chief and ordered all members of the Fourth Team to come out. Five red vehicles loaded with team members and air defense equipment drove into the field from outside. Fireworks were set off in a building in one corner of the field, simulating a bomb explosion and fire, and smoke filled the air.</p>
<p>Training Situation</p>
<p>After the air defense team arrived at the field, they first inspected the bombed field, arranged the guard soldiers, and reported the air defense sentry. Then the whole team mobilized. First, the blocked roads were opened, and the wires cut off around the roads were quickly handled by technicians. Firefighters rushed to the fire site, using soft ladders to climb to the roof, passing buckets, and vigorously putting out the fire. Then, they used ropes to rescue the victims on the upper floor. During the progress of various tasks, they received an alarm from the air defense sentry that enemy aircraft were attacking. All members immediately lay on the ground to take cover. Then, they realized that the bomb dropped was a gas bomb, and all members implemented upwind avoidance again. After the sentry reported that the enemy aircraft had gone west, all members rescued the hypothetical victims of another house that was hit by a bomb and performed emergency surgery on the poisoned people, using ropes and other methods. Then, the new sub-bureau's coroner arrived to examine the bodies. At the same time, a guarantee frame exercise was started. Mayor Zhou inspected on the commander's stand, and all the team members were extremely skilled.</p>
<p>Separate Parade</p>
<p>Then, a separate parade was held. All members were divided into five classes. After the inspecting officer inspected, they marched separately, with high spirits and neat steps. Then, the riot suppression training of the Second Team of the Police Corps was carried out. Four red police vehicles loaded with police officers drove into the field from outside, stopped separately, and the team members came out of the field and arranged themselves for various suppression trainings. Finally, the police band belonging to the team marched until four o'clock.</p>

The banquet ended at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, according to the complaint of the Zhenjiang Native Place Association in Shanghai that their fellow native Xu Xupeiwen was brutally beaten to death by Jiang Shiyan, a rickshaw boy at the North Railway Station, the association has repeatedly sent letters to the relevant authorities to thoroughly improve the illegal acts of some unscrupulous Chinese railway staff. According to the sections described by the Zhenjiang Native Place Association, the committee again requested the municipal government to severely arrest the culprit and bring him to justice in order to warn the ferocious and reassure travelers. Also, the Zhenjiang Native Place Association in Thailand, because Xu Xupeiwen was a fellow native of Zhenjiang and was brutally beaten to death, specially appealed on her behalf and submitted separate reports to the municipal government requesting the arrest and punishment of the culprit. It is reported that the municipal government ordered the police bureau to select experienced detectives to strictly arrest the culprit within a time limit and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e27">People's Respect and Awe <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>General Sun Liangcheng, the Pacification Director of Subei, hosted the various circles and fellow natives of Subei in this city yesterday. On January 19th of this year, the editorial board of this newspaper expressed high expectations for Mr. Sun. The environment of Subei is special and its position is important. Therefore, the military and political affairs of Subei have become the most acute area for competition, and the area where the hearts and minds of the people are most fiercely competed for. Why do we say that? Subei is a peaceful area. If the military and political affairs of Subei are well managed, and better than all aspects, it will not only establish the unanimous faith of the people in the north, but also be enough to influence other peaceful areas to do better. At the same time, bandits and mixed troops cannot compete under the principle of survival of the fittest. This is the problem that the authorities should pay most attention to, and it is also Mr. Sun's greatest responsibility. We believe that the central authorities chose Mr. Sun to preside over the military and political affairs of Subei because the responsibility is arduous, and only those who are honest and capable like Mr. Sun can be competent.</p>
<p>In the speech of the representatives of the fellow natives of Subei, it was hoped that Mr. Sun would achieve the two words "respect" and "awe," which has a profound meaning. It does not mean that Mr. Sun should respect the people and fear the people, but that "good people should respect them, and bad people should fear them." This is the highest administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>We strongly agree with this opinion. We not only hope that Mr. Sun will achieve it, but also hope that the military and political leaders in the peaceful area will achieve it. This is the time when politics is truly clear.</p>
