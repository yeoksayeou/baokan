<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營十七日下午三時三十分發表：（一）敵艦載機本日七時起，繼十六日之舉動，來襲關東地方及靜岡縣。（二）十六日對來製日本本土之敵機部隊加以邀擊，迄今查明之戰績，飛機計擊落飛機一百四十七架，予以大損害者五十架以上，船舶大炸起火者，計有大型艦一艘。日方自炸未歸返者六十一架，地上受損極爲輕微。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　接近日本本土之敵美機動部隊，十六日晨曾以艦載機累計一千餘架，空襲日本本土，歷九小時之久，敵機動部隊，現仍遊弋於近海一帶。十七日晟，敵又以艦載機之編隊執拗來襲關東地方，靜岡縣之日本太平洋沿岸之飛行塲等。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　神奈川縣日陸軍士官學校之學生等、曾擊落來襲該地上空之敵艦載機五架，其內容如下：十六日下午擊落一架，十七日上午八時擊落一架，十七日十時許擊落二架，其中一架，係噴冒黑烟而直衝墜下者。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日航空部隊，十六日上午包圍日本本土東南方海上之敵機動部隊，加以攻擊，重創艦種不詳之敵大型艦一艘（似爲空母艦），使其起大火災，此外，幷予其他艦艇以相當之損害。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日大本營發表　硫磺島周邊戰果敵艦五艘被擊沉　企圖登陸敵軍亦被擊退 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營十七日下午六時二十分發表：（一）敵於十七日十時許，在砲擊轟炸掩護下，企圖於硫磺島登睦，日守備部隊當即將之擊退。（二）自十六日以來，日軍機隊及守備部隊，攻擊該島週邊敵艦，所獲之戰果中，現已證實者如下：炸沉戰艦一艘，巡洋　二艘，艦種不詳者二艘，炸毀登睦用輸送艇三艘，此外並擊落飛機十架。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　硫黃鳥附近之敵機動部隊，十七日上午十時半前後，曾於該島西南部之二根濱海岸試行登睦，是時，該方面之日軍部隊，當即猛烈反攻，而將其部隊擊退至遠處洋上。其後未幾至十時四十分許，敵又變更方向，而企圖由該島東南之神山海岸登陸，是時，待機之日軍部隊，亦予此登陸敵軍以大根害，並將之擊退。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　十六日以來，以艦砲射擊硫磺鳥之別動有力艦隊，十七日晟來，其對該島砲擊之情形，更加熾烈，其用意則在於制壓日軍守備陣地。該攻擊硫磺鳥之艦隊，似有搭載登陸部隊之輸送船團及登陸舟艇，其後方尙備有相當强大之船團，由此可見，敵軍此行，在於攻陷硫磺島。按馬里亞納羣島失陷以來，硫磺島則化爲太平洋戰塲之最要前衛防壘，其於戰略上之意義旣重且大，洞察敵軍之此種舉動，業明示其於台灣及菲律賓海上之創傷似已恢復，其尙能出如此龐大之海上勢力者，亦係由於迥航於太平洋上英艦隊協助也。</p>
<p>日軍在硫磺島布成環狀堅陣</p>
<p>硫磺島十七日中央社電　敵美爲侵攻日本本土，並致力獲得近接基地，自本年時初以來，即日夜不息，而執拗轟炸硫磺島，至本月十六日，敵擬於該島登陸野望終於暴露。當十六日晨七時許，敵即以巨人型戰鬥機及卡基斯艦載轟炸機數大隊，反復來襲，繼之由南方海上開始艦砲射擊，當時記者曾立於該島中央高處之觀測台上，觀察四週之敵情，因知敵力之兵力約有空母戰艦一艘，以及巡洋艦，驅逐艦，輸送船等數十艘，此等艦船，分列於南西兩方，每方計分三艘，當時陰雲密布，且時有微雨之意，在此雲霧　漫中之下午一時前後，敵之艦砲射擊愈趨幟烈。斯時在其掩護下之小型登陸舟艇十三艘，由距海岸四公里許之遠處，漸次向島上接近，日軍士兵當即齊發巨砲，猛擊敵人，至下午三時許，敵軍終退至二萬至三萬米之遠方，此或爲偵察登陸地點之前哨戰亦未可知。按硫磺一島，全長八·三公里，最寬之處爲四·二公里，實乃二十平方公里之小島也，半部爲山岳地帶，日軍將兵已在鳥之周圍掘有環狀堅陣，而全軍之士氣復極旺盛，設使兇敵踏近該島一步，常即嘗試日軍之痛擊也。</p>

<p>東京十七日中央社電　滿洲國本年農產物之豐收，視去年並無遜色，其收買工作亦異常順利，截至去年年底，其收買成績已超過前年度一年之收買量，迨至二月中旬，已較去年增加二成，本年度收買目標，當可超過甚多。此於中日滿三國食糧供求上，當有偉大貢獻，日本重光大東亞相，六日致電滿洲國武部總務長官及黃興農部大臣，表示祝賀與感謝，並對滿洲官民之努力衷心表示敬意。</p>

<p>南京十七日中央社電　太平洋方面戰爭，刻巳至決戰階段、敵美不惜冒戰略上之大忌，伸長補給路線，攻侵東亞腹地，經盟邦海陸空軍之英勇邀擊，敵已陷入不可收拾之深淵，東亞十億民衆，對此無不敵愾同仇，而益堅其必勝信念。日前敵美陸長史汀生曾揚言將企圖在中國大陸登陸，然我全國民衆，對此更爲髮指。中央社記者昨特往訪國府海軍部長凌霄氏，叩詢對於此次太平洋決戰之觀感及設或敵軍在中國大陸登陸時，我新海軍已作如何之準備曁目下海軍躍進情形等各問題，承凌部長詳爲解答，茲誌答問如次：</p>
<p>菲島戰局盟軍有利</p>
<p>（問）邇來菲島戰局，日趨熾烈，盟軍陸海空軍全體將士之浴血奮戰下，已獲得偉大戰果，請問部長對此觀感如何？</p>
<p>（答）自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，盟邦海睦空將士，奮勇殺敵，三年來，其輝煌戰果已爲全世界人士所震驚，此種堅毅卓絕精神，深爲吾人所敬佩，敵美經此打擊，損失已極慘重，致軍需物資日形貧乏，其補給之困難，生產之減退，實已使其疲於應付，今者敵軍更　戰略上之大忌，跋踄長途，深侵東亞腹地，此實屬莫大錯誤。蓋現代戰爭，不在一地一城之得失，而在能持久消耗敵軍之主力，是以太平洋若干島嶼雖爲其僥倖登陸攻佔，但在軍事觀點上言，實無多大價値。目前呂宋之馬尼刺，已爲敵所侵入，但外圍之盟邦將士，正予迎頭痛擊，實行「出血戰術」。再據本人之觀測，近代作戰飛機重於戰艦，目下盟邦飛機產量突飛猛進，因此海上戰鬥部隊實力，益爲堅强，且盟軍接濟基地，近在咫尺，此亦爲盟軍處於絕對有利地位之明證。</p>
<p>我新海軍枕戈待旦</p>
<p>（問）日前敵美陸長史汀生氏揚言今後將在中國大陸登陸，請問部長對此意見如何？</p>
<p>（答）查敵軍在呂宋作戰，曾再三說明前途頗多困難，今後如欲對中國大陸作戰，實尙須要更多之時間及更多之物資，且自去年盟軍發動大陸攻勢後，美國所計劃在中國沿海作戰之企圖，已顯遭粉碎，且以目前情勢論敵軍刻正疲於奔命之際，若深犯我國土，必益遭重創，同時我新海軍亦正枕戈待旦，準備協力日軍，決予迎頭痛擊，蓋我全體海軍袍澤，咸已深具殺敵雄心也。</p>
<h3 id="c5">重慶延安交涉　再限於停頓 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　重慶延安兩政權之和解交涉，因雙方主張根本對立，致再度陷於停頓。重慶方面十四日復就該交涉提出讓步，但爲延安所拒絕，該項讓步共有四點：（一）承認延安之合法地位。（二）承認延安代表參加軍事委員會。（三）爲組織戰時內閣，承認延安及其他各黨代表參加行政。（四）爲檢討共產軍之補給及改編問題，由延安重慶及美國各代表組織委員會。爲據渝電，周恩來離渝時，曾攻擊重慶政權，對交涉之各種發表多屬不適當。</p>
<h3 id="c6">解決民食問題　須足量配給　諮詢委員馮炳南氏意見 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>「鄙人於民食問題，素所關切，自上年五月起，以民食日趨嚴重，民生益感威脅，故不顧本身虛弱，自吿奮勇，條陳民食治本辦法大綱，與前市政當局曁有關方面，討論解決對策，並曾先後提出意見多次。茲爲周市長羅秘書長曁劉配給處長，對於拙見易於明瞭起見，特將七八月來所提出之意見，擇要分述如次：</p>
<p>健康上所需最低量</p>
<p>（一）食糧統制制度，爲戰時體制下應有之措施，惟在實施統制之期間，必須同時實施食糧配給制度。</p>
<p>（二）食糧統制制度爲政府執行之權利，同時政府亦應履行其食糧配給義務，所謂權義相等，兩者不可偏廢。</p>
<p>（三）食糧配給量，不可低於人民健康上所需之最低量，亦即每月或每日之配給量，須等於人民健康上，所需之最低量。</p>
<p>（四）人民健康上所需之最低量，鄙人於數年前向前工部局主張施行配給制度時，曾請其就我國人民之習慣，及健康上所需求之最低量，從事研討結果，認爲每人年均每日需要食米一磅，以我國度量衡計之，每人每月約一斗八升，此在國人習慣上已予折扣，我國俗諺有「大口小口，一月三斗」，其意即大口小口平均每人每月三斗，（語見中國農村經濟第三五五頁）同時並須顧到者，凡用體力勞動之人、其消耗量每月一斗八升，猶屬不敷甚鉅。</p>
<p>軍糈民食同等重要</p>
<p>（五）戰時體制下軍糈，固然重要，惟民食亦應同等重視，至軍警及其他公務人員之特種重點配給，自屬無可非議，人民對此辦法，亦焉敢有所奢求，惟於健康上所需最低量之配給，應爲重點之重點。於施行重點配給之先，必須對於一般人民及軍警等之最低需要量，足敷配給後，方可實施，人民因生存關係，對於食糧最低需要量之配給，不得不要求一律均等待遇。</p>
<p>（六）無論戰爭時或承平時，人民之健康與民族生存，有密切關係，維護人民之生存，爲任何國家之首要任務，試觀已受國家法律判處死刑之囚徒，於其未執行死刑前，國家對之，亦仍負給養之責任。</p>
<p>配給量不足這影響</p>
<p>（七）本市自實施統制制度後，配給量從未能足敷人民最低需要量，致使有力者紛向黑市補給，遂使黑市價格，湧漲不已，加以配給日期，常不準確，且間有脫期，而不補配，更造成黑市猖獗之機會，結果使農民因求善價而沽、羣趨黑市脫售，影響統制機關之採辦工作匪尠。</p>
<p>（八）食糧統制之成敗，全視食糧配給量之足與不足，爲其重要關鍵。</p>
<p>（九）假定實行鄙人素來主張之每人每月配給一斗八升，深信黑市雖不能全滅，但其威脅民生與阻礙統制機能之程度，必大見減少。</p>
<p>（十）國家所持食糧政策，似應對農民採取穀貴政策，對人民採取穀賤政策。何謂穀貴政策？即提高採辦價格，於顧及農民成本之外，再加以合法利潤，藉以獎勵其生產。何謂穀賤政策？即抑低配給價格，顧及一般人民之購買能力，務使足以維持其個人及一家之生活，免致凍餒之處，其間所生之差額，應以捐稅彌補之，如能推行成功，必收國富民强之效。</p>
<p>（十一）收買盒糧應實行一元化之制度，現在統制會之收買人員，單位太多，戰時食糧出售者少，搜求者多，供求不能平衡，米價焉得不漲？</p>
<p>其他必需品之配給</p>
<p>（十二）他如燃料油鹽等數項，亦爲日常生活必需物品，旣經加以統制，即須實行配給。今煤斤與油皆已經久未配，即屬配給，其數量亦復戔少，鹽則從未配給一次。</p>
<p>（十三）水料亦爲人民不可一日或缺之物，戰時對於製水所需原料，容有缺乏之處，惟於人民所用水量，不能限制過低，尤其對於所謂里弄房屋，其居戶旣多，人口又復繁衆爲甚，水量限制過低，不僅影響人民健康至大，即在公用事業本身所應履行之任務，亦相差過遠，殊屬遺憾。</p>
<p>（十四）燃料煤斤供應旣感缺乏，應以柴炭等其他燃料配給，燃料與水之重要性，實屬相等，缺一人民即難以生存，煤斤缺乏，則柴炭等其他燃料應儘先供應人民生活需用，嚴禁工業及交通器具使用。</p>
<p>歸納所持各點意見</p>
<p>茲將上述各點歸納如下：</p>
<p>（一）最低需要量。</p>
<p>（二）其他統制品從速配給。</p>
<p>（三）配給物價格，應顧及一般人民之購買力。</p>
<p>（四）食糧配給務使不脫期。</p>
<p>（五）燃料先供人民生活上需要。</p>
<p>（六）食糧採辦一元化。</p>
<p>（七）施行重點配給前，先使一般人民，獲得健康上所需最低量。</p>

<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨天本市諮詢委員會舉行第十三次全體委員會。自從周市長就職後，諮詢會會召集一次臨時全體會，討論採購平價米十萬石問題，周市長因公未曾出席。所以，昨天的全體會議，也是周市長第一次出席諮詢委員全體會議。因此，到會的諸位同人，特別感覺熱望。</p>
<p>周市長在會議席上發表報吿，（全文見本日本報第二版）這篇報吿足足說了一小時，自始至終，情緒緊張，從頭至尾，一句不放鬆。周市長正在新病初癒，說到下半時，已額汗涔下。說到感觸的地方，說者幾乎流淚，聽者也極動容。所以，我想這篇報吿，不但希望全體市民細細一讀，同時也很希望盟邦現地當局抽暇一讀。</p>
<p>這篇報吿，全文分作兩大部分，一是關於內部整飭的，一是關於設施重心的。無論是內部整飭或是設施重心，可以說都是很扼要，很切實，而且很坦白。我們站在市民立塲，都竭誠擁護。報吿中關於整飭內部的第一點是縮小機構，根據簡單化的原則，合併裁撇。但是應着需要另外增加兩個機關，一是縣政管理處，一是人口疏散委員會。這更表示了縮小機構與增設機構，完全根據事實需要而決定，絕對不是表面的裝點粉飾。縣政管理處是爲推進市屬各縣的專管機關，爲加强外圍政治非常切要。本報社評曾屢次指陳，如去年七月二十八日論「促成滬市七縣模範區」，九月十八日論「懇談本市縣區現狀以後的感想」，本年一月二十三日論「上海市屬七縣應加調整」，一貫申論市屬縣政的重要。其次，疏散人口問題，更爲目前時局的急迫要求，特設委員會主持其事也極必要，本報社評也曾數四論列，如去年十二月二十六日論「上海人口疏散問題」，本年一月十四日論「民生問題與疏散人口」，二月四日論「新春第一事」，二月十五日論「疏散人口與限制入口」，均强調疏散之必要及其應取步驟。從這些地方觀察，民間輿論與當局施政業已取得一致的方向，更是非常欣慰的事。</p>
<p>周市長引用會文正所說的：「州縣所謂小事，即百姓之大事。」這是與民更始，體恤民艱的表示。簡單的說，市政就是替市民服務。所以，必須注意到市民的生活，消減市民的痛苦。最値得重視的，還是安定民生一點，在市民立塲，當然應該節約物資，無論衣食及其他生活用品均應極力撙節。在政府立塲自應竭盡所能予以最低限度的滿足。同時，希望盟邦當局也能予以最大的協力。</p>
<p>報吿中又說：「想做一種事業，第一要想辦法，第二要有辦法，第三要辦得通。」我想周市長在報告中列舉的設施重心各點，巳經充分表明做到了第一想辦法與第二有辦法的地步，所成問題的就是怎樣可以辦得通。我認爲市府已經有了辦得通的決心，市民也必有協力辦通的決心，同時，如更得到盟邦現地當局的最大協力，則一定達到辦得通的目的，而無事辦不通了。不過，近來對於市政各方面不能不說巳有革新，可是，最根本的民生安定問題尙未得到解決，換句話說，民生中最主要的米糧問題不能得到適當的解決，那末，一切民生安定固然淪於空談，而消滅市民痛苦則距離更遠了。</p>
<p>我們一貫主張目前應以軍事爲第一，但爲了完成軍事第一的目的，同時却也不能忽略政治的責任，如能做到最低限度的安定民生，然後政治才有作用，軍事才能事半功倍，否則，縱不是徒勞無功，但也必事倍功半了。我們希望中日的賢明當局充分反省，充分協力，向最正確的目標邁進。</p>

<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>諮詢委員會本來定三號舉行，因爲病了，臨時停止。滿以爲幾天就可痊愈，所以又定於十號舉行，那知道中間病勢加劇，又不能不延期到今天纔舉行，實在是非常抱歉。</p>

<p>我的報吿分作市府內部整飭，和一般設施的重點兩部分來說明。</p>
<p>內部整飭四要點</p>
<p>關於內部的整飭，第一是縮小機構。過去市府因爲由三方面合併而成，所以機構非常龐大複雜，不單是虛耗經費，而且辦事能力，也因之減少。責任不明，權限不淸。有利則互爭，有事則互諉，而且往往一件公事要經過十幾個人的蓋章，纔能發出。道樣的鬆懈和遲慢，那裏能應付現在瞬息萬變的局勢。所以機構不能不簡單化。例如公用局和工務局合併爲建設局，三個金庫統一爲一個，消費特稅處和總會計處之改處爲科，警察局各處之合併，業主不在土地房屋管理委員會及渝產管理委員會的裁撤，以及其他各局處所屬各科之裁併，都是根據這個原則。但是應着需要却相反的增加兩個機關，一個是縣政管理處，一個是人口疏散委員會。過去上海市所屬各縣沒有專管的機關，以致縣政不能推進，所以設專處以推動之。疏散人口爲目下急要之事，但工作艱巨，不能不設委員會以主持之。不過兩個新機關，縣政管理處所用的人限於極少限度，人口疏散委員會辦事的人完全是調用的。</p>
<p>第二是裁汰不必要的冗員。在時局緊迫的現在，照理應該是兩個人吃一個人的飯，一個人做兩個人的事。我們雖然不忍要求或强迫兩個人吃一個人的飯，但是很希望一個人做兩個人的事。市府現在人員過多，相反的兩個人做一個人的事，甚至於三個人做一個人的事，還有閑着無事可做的人。市府全體按定員總額共有四萬二千九百三十人。其中除警察局一萬五千餘人，保安司令部一萬一千餘人外，其他的人員，竟有一萬五千九百以上之多。這樣多的人，當然有許多無事可做。一個機關有許多無事可做的人，整個的精神一定鬆懈，紀律也一定廢弛，至於虛耗巨款，猶其餘事。爲提高行政效率起見，爲節省經費，增加得力人員待遇起見，打算逐漸把原有人數減去三分之一。我們明知此舉糾紛必多，反響亦必大，但是我們下了很大的決心，一定要實行。</p>
<p>第三是勵行紀律。其中又可分做禁絕貪汚和整飭精神兩點。過去的風紀如何，用不着詳說，今後對於公務員的行動，打算嚴密的監察，如果發現有利用職權舞弊營私的人，不是交特別法庭，就要交保安司令部以軍法懲治。不過上海爲萬惡之藪，我們知道有許多公務人員，並不索賄，而對方却拿賄賂來引誘。今後當本予授同科的原則，對於授賄的人，也以軍法從事。至於整飭精神，就是要辦事敏捷，條件不講好，公事就積壓不辦的積習，一定要根本剷除。其他拖延壓擱的習氣，也要澈底矯正。一個機關辦事不敏捷，對於下屬機關，尤其對於人民，是會給以很大的痛苦的。會文正公說：「州縣所謂小事，卽百姓之大事」，人民的呈請，主管人員輕輕的一擱，就會給人民以極大的不便或損失的。今後當由秘書處指定專員考核各局處公事辦理的遲速，以期敏捷。</p>
<p>第四是提高待遇。要公務員廉潔，必定提高他們的待遇，這是不必多談的。今後對於公務員待遇，常盡財力之所能及，盡量提高。不過我不能不坦白直率的說的，就是待遇提高的速度和程度，無論如何趕不上物價上漲的速度和程度。提高的數目，也決不會有因貪汚而得的贓款那樣多。但是我們一定盡力之所能及的去提高。現在決定公務員最低的每月發米三斗，薪津一萬八千多元，市區警察獨身的最低每月發米兩斗五升，薪津一萬二千多元。保安隊士兵，因在郊區和鄕區，物價較低，每月最低發米三斗，薪津五千元。這樣增加，我們明知不能算是怎樣充足，但是己經費了九牛二虎之力，因此薪俸和米價每月增加的總數，竟達七萬萬餘元。將來如果物價上漲太巨，還預備逐漸提高。</p>
<p>一般設施的重心</p>
<p>以上所報吿的，是市府內部整飭的要點，現在再報吿一般設施的重心。</p>
<p>第一是整理財政。要提高公務員待遇，要舉辦事業，都非有錢不可。所以財政如果沒有辦法，根本上一切都無從說起。但是驟然把人民的負擔，增加得太重，也不是我所願意的事。所以第一要剔除中飽，過去人民已經繳出，而政府並未收入的數目，實可驚人，如果中飽之數，全歸政府，人民負擔不加，政府的收入，却可增多。第二是嚴禁逃稅，狡猾商人，常以巧妙的方法，逃避其應繳的稅款。今後當嚴密的明查暗訪，務必禁絕。最近查出幾個娛樂塲逃稅，己經從寬處以罰金，此後則當從嚴處罰。這也不是增加人民負擔，不過要人民不逃避繳稅的義務罷了。這一方面，也可有相當收人增加。最近三週來消費特稅的增加，己表現整理的效果。第三是調整稅率。過去因爲有許多稅率不統一或不合理，使收稅人和納稅人可以上下其手，或繳稅人感覺不便，以致收入因此減少。今後如前一八兩區稅類之不統一的使之統一，如筵席捐稅率之不適合現在實情的，呈請中央，予以調整。又如房捐地稅等稅率，也應適應現狀，予以調整。稅率調整，收入亦可增加。第四舉辦新稅。支出增加太大，單憑上述三個方法所增加的收入，是不能彌補的。所以不能不舉辦新稅。前市長所定的舊一八兩區今春開辦營業稅，仍舊進行，此外如廣吿稅之類的稅收，也在計劃之中。總而言之，財政方面，努力求收支乎衡，不願意有虧空的情形。</p>
<p>第二是安定民生。這個任務能達到幾成，自己一點都沒有把握。因爲安定民生，一要使物價平穩，一要使配給充足。但是要達到這兩個目的，一定要市政府手上掌握着相當物資纔行得通，否則是不能達到目的的。一部分市民，不懂得這個道理，米貴了，怪市政府，物品不能按期配給，怪市政府，電力減少了，也怪市政府，這些事情本來也是市政府要負責任的。殊不知市政府是赤手空拳的，物資的收買，不歸市府，物資的支配，不歸市府，物資的運輸，不歸市府，物資的保管，也不歸市府。市政當局縱然有一顆赤心，實在只是一雙空手。一顆赤心，一雙空手，要能壓低物價，要能充分而按期的配給，除非有點石成金的本事，就是神仙也沒有辦法。我們所能的，只是很可憐的向各種物資統制機關，作揖打拱，請他們疏通來源，請他們按期佻給物品，請他們不要把配給價格，過分提高。但是這裏儘管舌敝唇焦的說，千哀萬懇的求，而各有權的統制機關也申述他們的困難理由，不能俯允我們的要求。市政府不會變魔術，沒有無中生有的本事，有甚麼辦法呢？所以受市民的責難，實在是寃枉。本人就職前後的幾日，米價略爲安定，大家歸功於我，說因爲我做了市長，所以米價跌了。這乃是偶然湊合的事，決不是我的功勞，我決不敢貪天之功，以爲己有。前幾天米價忽然漲了，這個責任，如果說完全應歸赤手空拳的市政府去負，也未免太酷。</p>
<p>但是我們決不推諉責任。過去因爲市府措置失宜，使物價暴漲的情形是有的，使物品配給，留難尅扣也是有的，這些弊病，我們有矯正的責任，也有矯正的權力。所以今後雖然因爲赤手空拳，不能積極的使市民生活較裕，但是一定努力減少甚至消滅市民所受的不必要的負担，損失，和痛苦。</p>
<p>力阻人爲的漲價</p>
<p>在戰爭時期，物價上漲，是必然的現象。任何國家都沒有法子阻止。不過上海除掉了自然的經濟原因以外，還有人爲的操縱原因。所以物價的上漲，特別劇烈。比如因自然的原因應漲高到十的，而上海却因人爲的原因漲到百或數百；又如因自然的原因一月漲高一次的，而上海却因人爲的原因，十天八天，甚至三天五天，漲高一次。市政府因爲只是一雙空手，對於自然不可抗的原因而生的物價上漲，老實說，是東手無策的。不過因爲人爲的原因所生的上漲，我們決心努力去阻止，例如只能漲十的，不許漲百或數百；只能一月一漲的，不許七天八天或三天五天一漲。我們第一要健全物價評議會。過去的評議會，不是阻止物價上漲的機關，而是助長物價上漲的機關。商人和主管人員勾結，就可提高公定價格。例如經濟局新舊交替之前，就放了不少的起身砲，把有些物品的價格也許提高到該業商人所希望的之上。這類情形，今後絕對要消滅的。我們打算請公正廉潔的專家，參加評議，對於事務人員，也嚴格選擇，嚴格監督，務使物價評議會，能發生抑平物價的功用。第二要做，是辦理物品登記及其移動以免囤積。老實說，囤積居奇，實在是物價上漲的人爲的主要原因。今後如果調查出來這樣的情形，情節重大的，爲大多數市民福利計，決以軍法懲處。不過過去調查工廠商店的經濟警察或經濟局人員，不少有藉此需索的。政府調查一物，就是給這些人以謀利的機會。所以取締囤積，或調查物價，市民沒有得到利益，若輩却先得到好處。今後嚴禁這類行爲，一經查出，予授同科，情節重大的，一定槍斃，毫不姑息。我的性格，是說出的話，一定要實行的，決不是危言聳聽。不過恐怕耳目不周，不能發現。希望諮詢委員會的各位，能够秘密幫同檢舉，並希望一般市民負責密吿。密吿人的姓名當絕對守秘密。不過不負責的匿名信，我們是不受理的。第三是整理各業公會。各業公會如果健全，也可以自治的方法，使所屬份子自肅。否則的話，就可利用公會的團體行動，壟斷居奇。所以健全同業公會也是抑制物價不可缺的一種手段。總而言之，人爲的物價上漲，我們要去根絕，我們要切實執行中央所頒各項抑制物價的法令，尤其要嚴格執行本月十二日所頒布的物價對策緊急措置。</p>
<p>關於配給，一般市民，當然希望分量增加，按期配給。不單市民這樣希望，我們也這樣希望，而且這樣努力。不過市政府本身是沒有東西的，前面已經說過，是一雙空手。所以我們只有盡最大的努力，向各種所有物資，支配物資的方面去交涉，請他們增加分量，按期發給。至於能不能辦得到，其權不在市政府，所以不敢保證。但是由各方面領到的物資，一定以最敏捷的而公平的方法，實行配給。不許留難，不許需索，不許尅扣，不許滲雜。市政府領到多少，如數發給市民多少。强有力的人，額外要求配給，我們是不顧情面，加以拒絕的。因爲分量有一定，强有力的人多配給，就不能不減少普通市民應得的配給。這種不公平的事，是絕對不許可的。配給方面，如有舞弊情事，也希望諮詢委員會的各位，協力檢舉，並且希望一般市民負責舉發。</p>
<p>確立市鄕區治安</p>
<p>第三是維持治安。要維持治安先要使負維持治安之責的軍警，本身不騷擾人民。如果這一點最低限度的事情，都做不到，還說甚麼洽安？但是過去人民固然懼怕匪盜，同時也懼怕軍警，甚至有時怕軍警更甚於怕匪盜。他們以爲被違法的匪盜刦掠，還可控訴，如果受了穿着法律外衣的盜匪的敲素，連控訴都不敢，因爲被控訴的軍警，將來要報仇，所以悶着吃虧，不敢聲張。在這情形之下，國家何必要軍警，人民何必要軍警？因此，要維持治安，首先要整飭軍警的紀律。這次待遇相當提高之後，對於敲索的軍警，一定嚴加懲處，以安社會。我很高興而安慰，市區員警，很知自愛和自肅，最近沿途勒索的現象，可以說是很少很少了。承諮詢委員會各位先生募集鉅款，獎勉他們，我乘此表示謝意。做長官的，看見部下這樣向上進步，自然覺得非常愉快。不過這種好現象第一要他繼續下去，第二要使他擴展到郊區和鄕區。</p>
<p>現在因爲時局的關係，郊區尤其是鄕區的治安情形，日益惡劣，所以充實軍警的實力，也是目前要做的事。我採精兵主義，不求量的增加，而求質的健全。一方面裁汰不必要的軍佐軍屬和警佐警屬，同時要加强訓練實際執行維持治安責任的員警，和補充實際作戰的戰鬥兵。對於市區之治安責成警察明查暗訪，務作事前的防制，偶有事件發生，必定責成於事後短期內破獲。對於郊區和鄕區的股匪和散匪，則責成保安團隊和保安警察隊，逐漸去肅淸。今後當本治安第一的主義，加强軍警的訓練，充實軍警的力量，發揮軍警的威力，在可能的範圍內，盡最大的努力，達成確立治安的任務。</p>
<p>改良封鎖管理處</p>
<p>第四是改良封鎖管理處。過去該處對於人民的勒索，甚於過去的釐金，重重剝削，漫無標準，鄕民有苦，無從申訴。本來打算將封鎖完全取消，因爲關係方面交涉還沒有辦好。現在想將封鎖處的人，減到最低限度，而且提高其待遇，嚴密其監察，如有違法之徒，輕則監禁，重則槍決，以減少人民的痛苦。</p>
<p>以上所報吿的，是今後五個月間的工作重點。至於其他如敎育之整理，和充實，公共衛生之推行，市內交通和市容的整飭，道路和溝渠之修理與疏浚，土地之整理和社會福利及宣傳業務之施行，各局處都有書面的計劃大綱報吿，不必在此地一一作口頭報吿了。</p>
<p>今後當領導市府全員，按着旣定的計劃，按步就班一一去執行，不過在這樣嚴重，複雜而微妙的環境之中，能不能實現預期的效果，本人實在是沒有充分的確信。在上一次各界歡迎的茶會上也曾經說過，在這樣局面下面，我們不希望事半功倍，如果能做到事倍功半，也就十二分滿足了，最怕是徒勞無功。然而徒勞無功的可能，實在是太多。因爲消極的阻碍，太大太多。例如一件計劃，舉辦得剛有眉目，幾千里外來一個戰事消息，就可以把這個計劃根本動搖；又如一件工作，計劃得很爲周密，一旦遇到一個軍事的必要，這個工作就不能不完全停止。這類的事情很多，各位都很明白，不必詳說。但是市府同仁，決不因爲道些困難而推諉逃避或放棄我們所應負的責任。儘管辦不通，我們最大的人事是要盡的。我常想做一種事業，第一要想辦法，第二要有辦法，第三要辦得通。不想辦法，是不盡責任；沒有辦法，就是沒有能力。但是有能力而負責的人所想的辦法，能不能辦得通，固然也視努力和能力如何，但是最大最重的關係，還是環境。儘管你有多大的能力，儘管你如何努力，在不可抗的阻力之下，是無力回天的。但是一般市民是不會這樣想的。他們只知道你事情沒有辦通，不管你有沒有能力，不管你是不是努力，也不管你阻力是如何的大環境是如何的劣。所以要得市民一般的諒解，我們不作此想，也沒有道樣可能。我們只求蝸盡我們所有的能力，以期無愧於心。所以雖然外有慚於淸議，只要內無疚於神明，我們也就心安理得了。今天在諮詢委員會各位先生之前，坦白的直陳我們的心境，希望各位先生，不單是儘量的貢獻意見，而且實際上協助各項政策的實行。周市長在諮詢委員會議席上報吿</p>

<p>— 靑木義勇</p>
<p>新市悲劇</p>
<p>漢口同仁會診療所防疫班，接到命令出發前綫服務。我携同助手兼事務員吉田太郎，護士小姐松田代及趙勝傑三名，於某月某日由○○車站動身。</p>
<p>在○○整頓復興部的陣容後，我們這個服務隊就坐在滿載食糧的載重汽車的一角上，僕僕風塵地從軍前進。在速日大雨後滿地泥濘的應急道路上，蜿蜒不斷的數百輛汽車，掛着五顏六色的僞裝圖，搖搖擺擺地默默前進。</p>
<p>在新市整裝待發的期間，雖說僅僅十天，但曾自動請求在試辦期間的桑田部隊所開設的戰地病院服務。病理試騐室，就成了我和助手的臨時辦公處，而外科手術室及將校病房，就成爲兩位護士小姐的臨時工作塲所。這也是戰地服務。打開醫藥箱，取出因陋就簡的診斷器，就開始檢查源源不斷送來的痢疾大便，以及傷寒病患者的血液等。這是很久以來，我和吉田未曾作過的工作了。回憶學習遠藤發明的細菌培養的時候，竟是五年前和十年前的事了。那是在大邱醫專的細菌學敎室，是在長崎醫大的研究室。吉田在十四歲時就跟我學醫，一直到今天形影不離</p>
<p>七月六日的前幾天，吉田因上吐下泄以及瘧疾，終於不能服務了。六日早晨，似乎也很勉强，我對他說：</p>
<p>「吉田！走吧！今天有很多材料呵！」</p>
<p>他一聽到了我的招呼，而立刻就精神復原似地跳起來。當我整理記錄，吉田注視人工孵卯的細菌時，突然聽到有人連呼空襲。立刻去逃避，原來是六架北美號B二十四型敵機在天空上飛過。數分鐘後又有警報發出，跳入防空壕一看，原來是三架敵機在低空槃旋而來。我們都在防空壕最裏邊，絲毫不動地伏着。轟轟的炸裂聲，穿越空氣的彈片尖銳聲，以及房屋的坍塌聲，都在相互交織着。數分鐘後，在悽慘的烟土中爬起來，連呼吉田，但無人作答。根據衛生兵的報吿，急忙跑到炸彈投落處的附近石牆去，發見吉田倒在血泊中，胸背都有巨大的彈片創傷，而傷口完全像石榴開花般地張着。幸而創傷尙潔，並無髒物滲入，因爲尙在呼吸中，所以斷定沒有傷及胸腔。此外大腿部上也有彈片貫穿着。因爲出血過多，身體完全虛弱，但呼吸力尙好。立刻注射止血藥，包裹臨時繃帶，然後運至外科手術室。</p>
<p>外科手術室的情形，非常悲慘。敵機以高掛着紅十字旗的病院爲目標，投下〇〇枚炸彈，其中投中病房的一彈，曾擊斃和擊傷〇〇名前綫傷兵。於是就把這批彈傷的傷兵。一個一個地送到手術室。吉田不忍視侍候自己的傍邊重傷者。自己仍以醫生自居，手不停地工作着，一直工作到救急囊中注射藥完全用罄，纔停止了對其他傷兵注射强心針及止血針。</p>
<p>把吉日送到病房後，我跑到復興部宿舍去速絡。狹窄的道路，被坍場的房舍雜亂地覆蓋着，簡直沒有挿足之地。不僅如此，還有不幸的就是在途中發生了大火災，火熖在欄阻去路。宿舍傍邊的路上中了炸彈，而半面宿舍完全炸毀，尤其是前面的二樓，更毀得可憐。有兩三位部員在拾撮炸飛了的物品，此外並無他人。松田護士被塌下來的東西壓傷，護士趙勝傑正從二樓走下時，就被炸彈震風所吹落，以致臀部刺傷及全身疼痛。</p>
<p>當天晚上，我們一同到北岸小山上去逃難病院也決定遷移，乘着陰曆十五的月夜光明，蜿蜒不斷的担架隊以及獨自步行的傷兵行列，圍繞着山轉。結果，我們大家都集合到原來位置的裏面去了。</p>
<p>這天晚上的空襲，比白天更加厲害。我們的營房安置好，以及傷兵剛剛集合完不到一個鐘頭，美機的機槍掃射和投彈轟炸，便開始了。爲使新市成爲一片焦土，三架五架地就開始波狀轟炸。乘着月光的明亮，每隔十五分或二十分鐘，爆炸昔消逝時，敵機就低空飛來，甚至發見一輛載重汽車，甚至發見一個小小的房舍，都要用機槍掃射，投下傘彈，這是美國對於人畜一齊殺的嘗試。傷兵及時疏散開，利用適當地形。我們都在担心，如果被敵機發見這末許多行動不自由的傷兵時，就會立刻斷送這大批生命。每次敵機來，都作道種担憂，但始終幸未成爲事實</p>
<p>我們在傷兵集合地附近的河邊，中國墳墓傍，支起蚊帳來，穿着鞋裏着腿而作暫時的休息，可是不到片刻，又不得不逃警報去了。由於接二連三的逃避，於是十數名部員，就索性四分五散去躺在適當的避難地裏，然而仍留在原位置者，只有我和八尾少尉，竹並汽車夫三人。我們三個人所躺的地方，是三個土堆圍繞着的一畝窪地，雖然是敵機侵入的斜面，但四次五次地飛來，於是我們逐漸不安起來。這種恐慌，是由於敵機有時從正對面飛來，又加上炸彈的投下是不分地方的，同時該夜敵機的尾部上有機槍，當我們認爲飛機飛過去就安心了，誰曾想機尾的機關槍就拍拍拍掃射起來。就是我三人立刻把頭縮到下面去。敵機不斷的來襲，致使我們疲倦不堪，當容襲完全解除時，纔相互道賀，仍在人世。</p>
<p>這是悲壯的新市對岸之一夜。上天眞是與我們作對，偏偏浩月當空，給敵機以方便。無人的新市城裏，就讓燃燒彈去盡量的焚化，偏偏又起了大風，於是火龍就到處奔騰了。正在看着的廟墻；突然一角坍塌了，隨着黑烟中的火星就四處飛騰。敵機眞討厭，又來轟炸了。這次森炸的對象，距離我們很遠。怒髮冲冠地凝視着敵機，又在一顆一顆地投彈了。遠遠的有倒豎着的二等邊三角形之火柱，在相等距離間忽隱忽現。</p>
<p>須臾間，空襲過去而惡臭的靜寂降臨了。就在這個機會，又在尋覔適當地點而在移動，接着就是點名和相互的問候。我正當裏在毛毯裏想作小綞時，就聽到一個女人的柔弱聲音喊：「松田先生！」似乎是那位華人趙護士小姐招呼伴侶的樣子。松田回答的聲音却沒有。</p>
<p>「松用先生不在，請到這邊來吧！」有人這樣回答。</p>
<p>「喂！喂！」</p>
<p>「到什麼地方？」這樣相互交談着，這位趙護士小姐就被表示好感的兵士，手掌着手地送到小山上。</p>
<p>我們三個人所躺着的窪地，現在已經成爲四個人，此時察襲又來了，眨眼間就飛到眼前，投下無數炸彈，致使飛砂走石，昏天暗地。又接着兩三次飛機來製，於是這位中國小姐不耐煩地說了一句：「先生，我不願在前綫上，我願回漢口，」我回答她說：「這是戰爭呵！你我是奉命來作戰的，這就是你們前汪主席所說的同生共死呵！拿出精神來，氣餒是沒有用的。」以後曾遭遇到數十次轟炸，我始終與趙小姐形影不離地逃避，或倒在一個狹小的地洞裏，或者我們倆緊緊蹲在防空壕裏，但後來她始終默默不語，一直到十一月上旬，終於完成任務，離別長沙。趙勝傑是受同仁會敎育大的，接着又在同仁醫院服務了五年，這個期間，深受了日本精神的感化，而此次隨軍出征渝軍，穿着軍服，過着日本兵士的生活，在思想和情緒上完全和我們日本人一致。診療完畢，在佔領區內向中國人民實行宣撫工作時，替我們日本作了很大的工作，正因爲她具有同一民族的感情，所以也會替我們日本衝鋒陷陣的戰士，作翻譯，眞是我們日本軍隊中的至寳。可以說，此次戰地服務人選中，最得力的一位中國人。</p>
<p>苦力之淚</p>
<p>繁華的市街，現在却無人行走，大門緊閉，商品及家具都運走，而只剩下華麗的招牌及裝璜，這便是歐美化的長沙市。大搖大擺在馬路上行走的，只是拂有要公的我們日本人。每隔一里或半里，都有嚴整的發火點，我以爲空襲時可作良好的避難所，然而一進去看，原來有很多死屍，或有傷病者躺臥着，且有雜亂的骯髒物件陣列着。馬路上的樹，仍是蔚然成蔭，劃分出兩傍的人行道，十字路口上指揮交通的警臺，仍然聳立着。</p>
<p>七月十一日我們到長沙的時候，市郊的軍事設施都完全撤去，市內的兵燹痕跡也完全洗除，而市民也逐漸跑回來，甚至西裝店的裸體人型身上也披上了美麗的衣服，雜貨店裏也陳列出來了五頗六色的然水瓶，眩目的雪白襯衣，花樣繁多的領帶以及襪子。點心舖裏，似乎擺設出帶糖的糕點，以及油炸的包子。復興部直接管理的野菜市塲，我們披星戴月地，在替日本軍隊收買絡繹而來的農民鮮菜。這批中國農民，吸完一袋烟後，就買回石鹽去，有時從我們這裏買一些治傷　，還有的求我們在傷口上綁繃帶，也有人替他們的父母妻子買一些奎寗丸。長沙的早晨，麻雀非常的多。其實不全是麻雀，而有許多聲音美麗的鳴禽類，一到了晨曦將臨時，總在窗外很快樂地叫一兩個鑲頭。</p>
<p>我們到了長沙的第二天，傷病者就開始來診治了，於是我們就暫時以辦公室作臨時診所。最初的病人，是被地雷炸傷的中國苦力，所以我們立刻感覺到了戰塲上的烟火氣息，其他都是普通的經痛，由於難懂的中國話，以及指手畫脚的動作，彼此間往往發出笑聲來，還有時誤認女作男，這就是當時長沙我們診所的一幅晨圖。</p>
<p>破壞這一幅圖畫者，是七月十六日晚上的敵機空襲。這天晚上轟炸聲消逝後，我曾在復興部正面的石頭台階上向遠處眺望，看着黑黝黝的一片烟火。有時發生火龍般的火熖，夾雜着似乎過年的爆竹聲。逐漸天暗了，但在黑影裏出現了四五個人，有的拐着杖，有的吊着臂，用一扇門抬進這樣的病人來了，於是我就喊出兩位護士小姐來從事治療。第三個病人是四十歲左右的女人，肩膀上被流彈所穿，對於肺部也相當有影響，抬到我們前面時，突然上吐下瀉，而服侍左右的十五六歲小姑娘，便哇的一聲大哭起來。打了兩針藥後，幸而停止吐血，呼吸狀態也逐漸好轉起來，所以暫時放在門前民家躺臥着，於是就看下面一個病人，偶然一看門外，方纔那扇門板上躺着的病人，顏色變了。於是就命令護士小姐實行緊急救治，當我拿注射箱去時，已經呈現出死色了。我雖一針一針打强心針，結果毫無效果。當時我的中國話是不能表示意思的，我只得從衣袋裏取出一張手紙來，蓋在死者臉上。小姑娘立刻放聲大哭起來。我在這種環境裏，不得不默默離開又去看其他的病人。</p>
<p>敵機的盲炸，後來也「光顧」過許多次。白天P四十一型敵機來偵察，差不多這己經成爲日常功課了。最大規模的轟炸，是七月〇日，那天差不多完全是燃燒彈，主要是把江邊無人住宅，完全燒爲平地。雖傷者眞出乎意外地稀少，我們雖然在等候着實行應急診治，但這次來看全不是炸傷，而是火傷，所以此次不僅繃帶用得多，而且軟膏也用得多。繃帶是〇〇隊搶來的戰利品。其中也有香港救國隊，和大剛報徵慕或捐贈的繃帶，後來便被所謂救國戰士所拋棄，而現在落到我們手裏，却在救同樣的中國人。</p>
<p>八月中旬的一個月夜，正在寢室內籐椅子上睡覺的我，被森然一聲的炸彈爆裂所驚醒。多半是發見了燈光外泄，而實行的俯衝轟炸，後來便無事了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，按平常的時間起來，拿着面盆到井邊去打水時，在晚霧所籠罩着的門前面，站着一位奇怪的病人。這好像是手腕受傷了的十歲兒童。近前一看，原來是由左肩到肘部有一個大的創傷，用繩子吊着滿是血的臂膀。</p>
<p>「飛機來，砰？」這樣一問，他似乎瞭解我的意思。我又問：</p>
<p>「父親母親沒有？」</p>
<p>毫無表情地說了一聲，「母親有」。母親究竟作什麼事呢？我在心裏這樣想着，就把這滿是血的負傷者領到診療室去了。</p>
<p>門前逐漸集合了許多負傷者，其中有和方纔那個兒童一同被燒傷的一個五十多歲苦力。這個苦力因出血過多，甚至站着都很困難。在馬路上實行診治。把滲入砂土的創口洗滌淸潔後一看，筋和肉都斷了，骨頭却沒有斷。他眞是髒得無以復加。蓬頭散髮，滿臉泥垢，甚至耳朵和鼻孔都藏着很多塵土，衣服則和汚泥分不出來。他好像剛從坍塌的自己家裏逃出來的。據說，這個人是和那個兒童住得很近的。</p>
<p>第二天，他們像父子般的關係，一同來我的家。這兩偶人，只說來看一天病，結果來看了十天。有一天夜裏，敵機又來投彈，以致復興部完全被火焚毀，幸而受傷者很少，但第二天早晨，這兩個父子般的人，終於不見了。過了一個星期左右，只是那個苦力到診療所來了一趙。他還是那個髒相，但在那塊繃帶上，只是多滲出了許多膿和血。我一打聽那個小孩，纔知道被大人帶到鄉間去了。我稍微感覺到想念的意思，只好單給這個苦力治療，但很不容易好。</p>
<p>有一天，我們接到軍事當局命令，要到湘陰和長沙兩縣鄕下去實行醫療和宣撫工作，但病人己多，眞無法停診，只好貼出佈吿，說要到他處去。第二天，我作最後的一次診療，曾給每個病人相當長期間的藥品，叫他們小心換藥，但他們多半都表示華「沒辦法」，其中那個苦力，接到了藥和繃帶，與我分手時，竟熱淚奪眶而出了。我的心頭也覺得一酸。</p>
<p>紅十字旗前進</p>
<p>腰中滿帶手榴彈及手槍，並且脚穿日本鞋，身穿便服的憲兵們，跟隨着嚮導和翻譯，一直地向前走。接着就是像兒童兵的松田護士小姐，和上半身穿着中國服，下半身穿着日本大兵衣裳的華人趙護士小姐。再後就是手携着白色材料箱的吉田技術助手，以及掌着紅十字大旗的田上曹長，値班兵保安隊員，擔架行李的兩個苦力。最後便是手拿着小診療箱及救急囊的我。這便是戰地服務去的我們醫療宣撫隊之普通隊形。警備隊的士兵保護着我們，他們總是掩旗息鼓，僞裝着一切用具。</p>
<p>八月二十四日早晨，離長沙復興部後三天，和中華電影街頭放演班一同，在長沙近郊數處巡視一番，並在數處住過，至九月三日又回到令人討厭的新市來了。在新市停留了九天，由於該地警備隊的勞苦功高，市民終於慢慢回來，於是我們便以這批回鄕來的市民爲工作對象，以診療和電影爲宣撫他們的工具。後來，又來了鐵路建設部隊的人員，凡是粵漢路破壞的地方都加以修理。</p>
<p>我們追隨着片岡隊，由新市附近的某地，向粵漢路橋附近一部落的大楚河移動。我們縱隊山成熟的稻田中穿越過去，跋山涉水地向前進行。今天的班旗，是由憲兵隊的翻譯在前頭舉着。有汽車公路的山坡，映着遠霞，河水在紅土堤問潺潺地流着。初秋的爽風，的確是最好的行軍日。我在出發前，曾特別留心右面山下的敵匪和地雷，但因大好山河的美景，却使我不得不極目四眺。點點的房舍，田地裏仍有農耕的痕跡，但住民却沒有。爲什麼我們到的地方沒有中國居民呢？這是因爲未經宣撫地方的普通現象，無足爲怪。同時由於他們巧妙的瞭望與傳達，一看見我們日本人的踪跡他們就全體消形匿跡。有時候，只能看見妞妮而來操家的老太婆，以及好奇心勝爬窗偷視的兒童，除此以外，任何中國人也看不見。</p>
<p>終於到達我們所要到的部落了。因爲由於樹木包圍着，從遠處只能看見森林而看不見村莊。但出乎意料所及，人家非常多，在社堂前面，排列着桌椅，有四五十人喝酒喝茶，揩着熱手巾，似乎是歡迎貴賓的樣子口他們一看見我帶着紅十字臂章，大家詫異。同聲地說，軍醫官！軍醫官！我因爲叫他們看我是普通醫生，所以就把鐵盔摘下來，露出散亂的頭髮來。他們請我們喝酒，終於相處熟了，便開始讓我們治病。</p>
<p>因爲早就預定好了趙護王小姐當翻譯和幫忙，松田作塗藥和洗滌工作，所以重病者格外多，只能在預定的兩小時內診治了七十個人。患痧眼者特別多，像我們這樣因陋就簡的街頭診療是不能救這批人的眼疾的，後來發見兒童中特別多，更不能不使我們心酸。</p>
<p>該地的居民，似乎完全沒着見過醫生，當看見聽診器時，都心中忐忑不安，而不得不用手去摩一摩究竟是何物。在兒童的頭上和臀部所生出來的膿瘡，放入一個特大的注射器，把膿排泄出來，於是中國羣衆都認爲我們是神醫。我們看見病兒的母親在又驚又喜的表情時，心中纔稍微得到了一些安慰。</p>
<p>村莊的早晨，由於鷄鳴，和日本軍隊的奉唱聖旨而明亮了。到河邊去洗臉的我，被一羣昨日治病的小孩包圍着，似乎都在說這位醫生眞神通廣大。業已開始工作的農民，似乎問着早安說：「先生肚子飽了？」在空中飛着日本飛機，映現出太陽符號來，這眞是安居樂業的和平村景象。（筆者爲長崎醫大助敎，兼同仁會防疫部長）。（林譯自二月號大陸雜誌）</p>
<p>大東亞戰區形勢圖</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的焦點有四，即（一）西南太平洋戰綫，（二）菲島戰綫，（三）西南大陸戰綫及（四）印緬戰戰。通觀此等焦點，、地域固有差別，戰况亦復相異，然其一貫的特徵則爲此四條戰綫均屬日美兩國傾力死鬥的戰場。敵美的物量總反攻由一九四二年七月的瓜達爾卡那作戰開始，自此以後，戰塲北移所羅門羣鳥，復分爲二，一經吉爾貝特·馬紹爾·馬里亞納·而於一九四四年九月中旬移向培里琉·安加烏爾等西加羅林海域，一由新幾內亞北岸西進，經必阿克·儂福爾·亦於同年九月中旬移往以馬洛泰爲中心的摩鹿西海。及至同年十月，敵美夾擊的尖端乃吿會合，開始眞正的侵攻，於是台灣海面，菲島東方海面海空戰相繼展開，其實力雖受甚大損失，但仍憑其物量，於菲島中部的雷伊泰島登陸，繼又上陸明多羅島·於是日美兩軍演出空前的血戰。旋更北上，於呂宋島的仁牙因灣沿岸上陸，驅師南下，直指馬尼刺。該方面的日軍，早就成竹在胸，以逸待勞，採取彈性戰略，不以城市的得失爲懷，專在打擊麥克沃塞麾下的美軍，使其大量出血。是以馬尼刺之陷落與否，對於菲鳥戰局的前途，實無多大影響，而麥克沃塞縱然獲得該市，亦未能立即決定其在菲島的勝利，蓋山下將軍指揮下的數十萬日軍，迄今無恙，而呂宋島上的險要地帶，亦在日軍掌中。總之，菲鳥戰事今後勢必日形劇烈。（圖及文均根據朝日畫報一百五十五號）</p>

<h3 id="c33">畢業後 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦</p>
<p>十月的雲像綿羊，十月的風像海汐，十月的陽光像廟堂裏的燭燄。</p>
<p>庭前的那株夾竹桃樹，已落盡了最後一片花瓣，顯得枝葉疏落，淸廋了許多；侷處在牆角的那株小批杷樹，樹幹廋削盈握，在巴掌大的葉子上也蒙上了一層暗塵，再也找不到半點葱綠的嫩葉了。</p>
<p>祇有那棵秋海棠却開得正紅，花朶兒浮着倩笑。</p>
<p>大地開始步入蒼老的歲月。</p>
<p>學校也開始上課了。學生們又川流不息地在大厦裏聚散着；敎授們挾着厚皮包踏上講合，寫下了那重複多年的敎材；走廊裏充滿着嘈雜的人聲；化學實騐室裏溢出二硫化碳的臭味；電機室內軋軋的馬達聲；校園中放着幾架經緯儀，Flag　Pole上的紅布在風中飄揚，是土木科的同學在實習測量……。一切的一切，和三年來的景像沒有兩樣，相隔兩月，現在我又重溫學校的舊夢了，對着這些熟悉的聲音與影子，不禁要問一聲：「別來無恙？」</p>
<p>但是，我終於找到了一些不同的地方，我不再看見那一批熟悉的面龐了，他們已經畢業，永遠離開了這學校，代替他們進來的，是一大羣陌生的新同學們。在往昔，我的心裏一定會充滿着高興，因爲在我們人生的旅途上無形中又多了一羣兄弟姊妹，共同向一個目樣邁進，雖然我並不認識他（她）們。</p>
<p>可是，在今年却有些異樣，心湖裏泛起了漩渦，感到不能再安寗下來。</p>
<p>一個朋友問我：「你今年是Denior了？」</p>
<p>「唔。」我回答。</p>
<p>「好呀，就在明年好畢業了。眞快，眞快，哈哈！」他拍着我的臂膀笑着。</p>
<p>我望着他，沒有話說，祇對着這位朋友一笑。</p>
<p>收到遠地一箋來鴻，裏面寫着這樣一名話：</p>
<p>「恭喜你明年要戴方帽子了。」</p>
<p>我看後，也對着信紙笑了。</p>
<p>中午，在一家大學生常常光臨的廣東飯館裏遇到W小姐，在閒談之中，又提到了我明年畢業的問題，於是W小姐想起了一個問題：</p>
<p>「明年畢業後你預備怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>這問話像一把大槌，打在我的胸脯上，感到一陣壓縮，眞的，「畢業後預備怎樣呢？」—我問着自已。</p>
<p>對於W小姐的問語，亦祇能以「一笑」了之。</p>
<p>除了拿「笑」來回答，我還能說些什麼呢？</p>
<p>我沒有想到一到四年級別人就會問起我這些話，我更不曾料到當時會噤若寒蟬，說不出一句答語，雖然離開畢業還有迤長的一年，但是，我已漸漸開始感到煩惱了。</p>
<p>C君研究工程的人，畢業快一年了，但是一年來他不在設計室裏製圖，也不在工塲上監工，却在銀行裏當會計員；另外一位學建築工程的H君，他畢業之後，就以他語言舉的天才，一躍而爲日語翻譯員，雖然在他的學校中從沒有日語這一個學程。W君·T君·L君畢業後合資經營一個股票公司。大展其商業鴻圖，他們一定會懊悔從前在校裏沒有去讀商科而竟去選了土木工程。S君·M君·F君都當了中小學的敎員，據他們說，雖然是「大才小用」，但是在這年頭一切事情都不免「小題大做」，隨遇而安而已。王君畢業後仍暫在回力球塲當售票員，最近他爲了找不到正式的職業正在憂慮，如果再有半年還找不到適當戰業的話，他那四年內所受到的電機工程的智識勢必將拋諸三十三天外了！還有一個朋友告訴我說他今年畢業的一班截至目前爲止我到正式職業的祇有五分之一的人，在其中找到所謂「本行」職業的不過五六人而已。</p>
<p>「畢業即失業」和「所學非所用」，是從畢業後的朋友口中常常聽到的兩句話，我沒有想到這兩句「老調」至今還存在着它的力量，但是什麼是發動這力量的最後力量呢？</p>
<p>—是社會的缺陷？還是敎育的失敗？</p>
<p>在電車上遇到一年多未見的Y小姐及另外一位F先生，承Y小姐的不見外，告訴了我還有半年她就要與F先生結婚了。我忽然問她道：</p>
<p>「你不是還有半年可以畢業了嗎？」</p>
<p>「　！不錯。」</p>
<p>「這眞不壞呀，畢業—結婚，眞是雙喜臨門了！」我虔誠地祝賀着，Y小姐紅着臉微笑了。</p>
<p>下了電車，剛踏入校門，我忽然拍了一下大腿，想起了一條眞理：</p>
<p>「畢業後一條極佳的出路——結婚！」但是我再想了一下，覺得興趣大殺，因爲：</p>
<p>可惜現在不興「招女壻」呀！</p>
<p>蕭伯訥處置人生的方法，他以爲一個人應得先跳到人生的盡頭去，然後再從容的回轉來仔細體味人生，可是現在我知道得太遲了，如果我早能嚐到現在的煩惱，再回去體味大學一年級時候的樂趣，一定要更好些罷。</p>
<p>「畢業後預備怎樣呢？」問題還在耳畔響着。</p>
<p>我的心靈，像外邊天氣那般的陰沉。</p>
<h3 id="c34">沉默之章 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 田妮</p>
<p>我愛沉默，而且，我記得，這僻性不屬於我，我們會常常坐着相對無言。可是寂寞也有邊際，儘管我們愛着沉默，有時也會有聲音打破這片刻的沉靜。而，首先讓粗突語聲衝入靜和空氣的，總是你。</p>
<p>你就是有着一個這末奇怪的性子。當我以手托頤作深寢邃的沉思，你會用企羨的眼光視我，你也許羨慕我有着如此幸福，因爲我居然會有拚棄煩擾的能力；於是你也隨和，以你的小手托頤，這樣，我們都落入可愛的沉默了。可是，不久，這沉默在你當不復可愛，你畢竟有孩子的躁性，任你是怎樣溫靜，你使了性子。在那奇異的沉默之後，當是用你自己的聲音來敲破你自己造成的械靜的世界的時候了。</p>
<p>「太寂寞了。」你這樣喊。</p>
<p>我知道你不會久躭於沉默，這喊聲正如我的預期。可是我未曾理你，如果我對自己底沉默的能耐有一份驕傲，我正想如何來訓練你，不理是我沉默的表徵。而且我留戀於我的片刻安靜，我沉湎於記憶，逝去的王國是我迷寐中的世界了。我思慮中不復有你，即使有，也是不實際的。人如有一刻奇幻的經歷，她該是幸福。</p>
<p>「怎麼，你在瞌睡了？」這聲音在沉靜中響得多麼刺耳。我因而驚醒，睜開眼，茫然若有所失。我起視周圍的陳設，身傍有一個你；我恍惚做了一個迷離的夢。</p>
<p>你的臉孔還是現着問號。因此，我向你作了一個苦澀的微笑。你不懂得的，我心裏暗想。我至此不能支持我的能耐，回答你：</p>
<p>「不，我閉着眼，在追尋思想的踪跡。」</p>
<p>這句話，在你，當又是神秘的意味。你張着眼顯明不僅，然後你又以企羨的神情視我，想瞭解語中的深意。</p>
<p>我尋思想的踪跡，你尋恍迷中的我。</p>
<p>於是，我重復低頭托頣，向你示意我須往恍迷中去尋思想的綫路。如被沉默佔領，我們當是幸福了，至少我。</p>
<p>我不復顧慮你的關切，一脚踏入幻想的王國，我到底進入了久久所慕念的又被人想望着的地方了。我彷彿瞧見了那奇異國土的萬丈光芒，射入兩目眩暈。儘管思想的踪跡是雜亂無章，我的幻念有了標的。我恍惚聽見你在我身傍的語聲，它是憶念的因子，即使我入迷離的幻境，我都記住了有一個你。</p>
<p>於是我不曾在恍惚中迷了路。在這陌生地里我曾慌張失措，有一個你，有一個你的聲音，我鎭定了我自己。這樣說，我倒發現聲音之可貴。有時，我們是在一個多麼寂寞的世界里！我要嘉許你了。</p>

<h3 id="c36">追評中北華聯友誼賽　對華汕戰裁判之我見 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>前週末第三屆藍球聯賽甲甲組第一循環最後一塲，中北與華聯決鬥，不啻爲南北大戰，亦可爲揭空申報盃懸未解決之冠軍問題，實爲最能引人人勝之一役。故比賽時間須八時，而未至六時球迷已接踵而來，以致球房內擠得水洩不適，超過預定數倍以上。界綫圈內，佔去不少地位，實有礙正式比賽。唯如照當時情形，即停止比賽，易滋事端，不得已經當局與雙方議定，決改爲友誼賽，實爲使跋涉之球迷不致空勞往返。但在狹小之球房內之演出，當未能儘量發揮。茲不妨略作評述，唯不致此一塲聯賽，將待至何日？及當局謀如何妥善之維持，頗令球迷關切。</p>
<p>趙雅林出色異常</p>
<p>是役之結果，中北仍操勝利。究中北能勝之主因，爲各個隊員俱有長足之氣力，乃能發展。而該隊之陣容，轍有令人捉摸不定之排列，實爲汪領隊戴指導之悉心研究　對方之　球隊作支配。是戰又重用趙雅林，決爲應有之調遺。一方面利用趙之長度高，國一方面則爲雅林之近况極好，其射藍功夫亦恢復其在北平全盛時代之雄風，單手反身一記，有獨到之點，而其苦幹潑刺之精神，在外長地看來，必加非難，實則雅林固準北派「乾脆兒」之表演。且雅林在無意撞人之後，必表示歉意，脾氣絕佳。其餘陳學宗亦有滿意之成績，震中每賽無不是處，不媿國手。本屆在中圖北第一次，露臉之包松圖，因其他隊員之指望，均較包爲上，故不若在華影隊中時唯我國獨尊之概。致中北隊之人釘人防守衛，其站之地位，及相互調換看人，均見純熟。該隊在汪戴兩氏策劃下，照目下情形，正常以往，其在技術方面之貢獻，必可使球迷得更多之欣賞！</p>
<p>張溎詳嘗試新陣</p>
<p>華聯在此戰中，領隊張溎詳煞費心血，試新陣容以臨大敵，失敗固另外一件事。但嘗試之陣綫，爲一般人所不能想到者，而有顯著之成功。如菊生之前鋒，慶公之後衛，俱最近所未曾見到者。華聯在此戰中，當然未盡最大的努力。又以吳成章之隨便，學宗之格外出色，此亦爲輔歷。旣因此戰之屬於友誼性質，華聯視爲試金石，寗願敗，且作一練習，何曾不可，不長奇也。來日正式聯賽，或能藉此戰中聆會，應作如何之方策矣。</p>
<p>綜論，中北又勝華聯一役，賽由聯賽改爲友誼賽，得失無關宏旨，來日再見，顯我上下，中北亦必愼防。</p>
<p>華聯汕隊比賽裁判差誤百出</p>
<p>本週二華聯與汕隊之第二循環賽，仍極受球迷之注意，故雖屬新正休假期內，熱鬧情形，一如理想中也。</p>
<p>此次雙方均用緊逼人釘人制，每爲對方得球時，必追隨逼其脫手而後。且決不輕易使對方有上藍之機會。以故分數極少。上半時爲九對四，總結果二十對十一，均爲華聯佔先。如此接近比數，尤爲球賽中最標準之比數。惜是賽因觀衆不滿裁判之過失太多，喧鬧不已，乃致激動球員間微有不軌行動，幸卽吿平息。按是日裁判這楊烈誠，金伯陶輔之。以兩人之能力而言，金實較楊爲佳。但楊君頗有擅職之素來脾氣，在如此緊張之比賽中，彼不知略事引退，乃一有錯誤，致令觀衆怪叫，於是越鬧越胡鬧，確有不盡職處甚多。此楊君應知其所以然，而在輔助地位之金伯陶，頗多坐視地位，一反平日之能力，亦應負不盡職之罪也。筆者，每賽必到，對裁判之爲難，素表同情，前亦曾在本刋撰「藍球裁判難」二次，但此次確以事實昭然，不得不加以私見，幸裁判會方面，有以敎正。</p>
<p>今夜中汕再逢勢必各鬬新法</p>
<p>甲甲組第二循環中北汕隊再相逢，按申報盃汕隊曾勝中北，三屆聯賽第一循環，中北卽復仇，則今晚（十八日）之相逢，爲第三戰。稱之謂該兩隊三賽二勝制之最後決鬧亦可。預料雙方必鬭智鬧力，一塲大廝殺也。目下兩隊俱取人釘人戰衛，故將看一對一之用命鏡頭。而中北之能臨陣有最佳之陣容，爲最値得倆服，汕隊當謀對圓之陣容。最需要者，勿必以固定之陣容應付，須觀對方之人頭而作支配，庶幾有意想不到之表演。考近况中北在聯賽中尙保持不敗，汕隊則已受華聯二敗，中北一辱，士氣方面而言，當不逮中北。故論理，中北應可勝利，總之，此戰亦精彩之幕。</p>
<h3 id="c37">中葡怀　二次賽雜感 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>中葡盃本屆恢復後，極爲各界所矚目，蓋以兩軍之球藝，俱爲滬上之名將。當必有顚峯之演出，以饜球迷，比賽仍取三賽二勝制。其第一戰於一月一日在逸園舉行，葡隊精銳齊出，中華隊則未見整齊，於是以二比四敗於葡萄牙。</p>
<p>兩軍陣容凋零　演出無從精彩</p>
<p>逎者第二戰於農曆元旦日（二月十三日）本週二下午，在跑馬廳球塲舉行。在事先，我人必以爲葡隊勢將再接再厲，完成覇業，而中華隊亦必以最理想陣容，庶幾能奪取勝利，復能有精湛之球藝表演。豈料我中華隊隊員中以東華隊所選入之球員，均以事不克參與比賽，乃無不爲中華隊抱危。不意葡萄牙臨陣之時，亦竟有潘里米，維克泰，考司坦，鮑休脫，W潘脫遜，福恩等六員上將缺席。由後備軍及乙組羣中拉湊數人成軍。故中華隊雖屬不見理想，仍得以五對○之鉅大比數，壓倒葡萄牙，獲得勝利，不負衆料。但以雙方之陣容凋零，精彩自然極少。</p>
<p>以是日之陣容實力而論，中華勝五球，不爲多也。蓋葡萄牙鳥合之衆，前綫上除V蘇若，中衛綫僅一奧列維拉，後衛一柯萊脫，想徒恃此三角綫之進球與進攻，烏可得哉。一盤散沙耳。中華爲聯誼之班底，輔以華通孟義良，滬警郁氏昆仲等，在合作方面，極少影響，連奪五城，絕無倖致。</p>
<p>葡隊草率應付令人莫測高深</p>
<p>唯筆者對此賽，觀後不無有感。緣過去中葡盃情况，終屬如火如茶，而兩軍對盃賽，重視異常，選拔隊員，加緊調練，費盡一番心血，臨陣乃終有良好之成績，故不論勝者負者，其認眞從事，則實具吸引球迷之力，而造成球史上値得記載者也。本屆此次第二戰竟爾造成如此渙散現象者，實令人莫解其所以然矣。又以葡萄牙對此行歷史性之戰，在此緊要關頭，七零人落，是有意放一馬耶？或另有其作用耶？抑待至最後一賽中再顯其威力耶？此非該隊當局，難以明悉個中奧妙。總之，與過去之認眞，必要奪得銀盃之作風，迴然不同，則爲事實。最後，筆者唯有期望第三戰時，彼此俱能有必勝之決心，傾師以來，務使本屆之中葡盃有最希望中之收獲，亦所以不負足聯會恢復此項盃賽之苦心孤詣，則幸矣幸矣。</p>

<p>今日（十八日）上午在逸關有甲組聯賽精彩一幕，卽爲聯誼鬥滬警。前者在聯賽中僅有一和，餘均勝利，獨佔警首，自有奪取冠軍之濃厚希望。考聯誼本季出師以還，聲勢甚壯，戰績亦稱可觀，唯在聯賽中與德商成和局，市長盃又受德商之毒手，其殆德商爲該隊之尅星歡？好在聯誼在聯賽中仍具希望。對市長盃旣無間津之路，當付全力於此，今朝應具決心臨敵。查滬警之人頭，確甚可觀。而本屆却鬰鬰不得其忠，直至最近市長盃中始以二對一克服喧赫於時之葡商，發揮其應於之球藝。而其最可怕者，乃爲其攻勢銳利。小黃毛之一竄，麥其當之脚頭，聯誼當求勝利，必須覓制止此二人之道，而自身之最大要點，必須用最孚人望之中衛綫。宋繫聖、瞿永福、鄭英權均要出席，如此纔能呼前應後，則以該五鋒之能力，一得助攻之中衛綫，必能有破敵之果。更望者，切忌過於意氣用事，應平心靜氣，須知愈有火氣，愈易失常，始終保持上塲時之精神，則其收穫，無論如何，予球迷之印象必佳，切盼諸健兒牢記此點。</p>

<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>（三）在某種戰略上，作爲擺佈陣綫，適應時機之戰筆。</p>
<p>（四）使能保持獲球機會，免被對方奪去。</p>
<p>（五）用作脫逃對對方之搶奪。</p>
<p>（六）用作虛騙對方。轉移局勢，國引對方走散。</p>
<p>（其）當無人防守時，使能拍球近籃，以便於投入</p>
<p>（三）拍球三要決</p>
<p>（一）步代常改變，不可常用一種步法，及一定之速度前進。宜用各種快慢而不定，使人莫可捉摸之拍繫與步法，以適應時機與環境。（二）用離敵較遠之一手拍球：例如敵在右方追踪搶球時，則宜用左手拍球。敵在左方槍球，則用右手拍球。（三）急轉方向。例如遇敵在前，先虛裝向左便拍球，使敵身體傾向左方，而失去重心時，急轉向右方拍繫，衝過彼身邊前進。</p>
<p>（四）拍球常識</p>
<p>（一）在前塲（即本籃區），不可常以拍球前進，（除非前塲空着）。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Air Force Claims 200 Enemy Planes Shot Down; Air Force Simultaneously Attacked Enemy Mobile Units <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 17th: (1) Starting at 7:00 AM today, enemy carrier-based aircraft continued their actions from the 16th, attacking the Kanto region and Shizuoka Prefecture. (2) On the 16th, enemy aircraft units approaching the Japanese mainland were intercepted. As of now, the confirmed results are: 147 enemy aircraft shot down, over 50 severely damaged, and one large warship set ablaze. The Japanese side lost 61 aircraft that failed to return, and damage on the ground was extremely minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - An enemy American mobile unit approaching the Japanese mainland launched over a thousand carrier-based aircraft in total on the morning of the 16th, attacking the Japanese mainland for nine hours. The enemy mobile unit is still cruising near the coast. On the 17th, enemy carrier-based aircraft formations persistently attacked the Kanto region and Japanese Pacific coastal airfields in Shizuoka Prefecture.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Students of the Japanese Army Officer School in Kanagawa Prefecture shot down five enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking the area. Details are as follows: one shot down in the afternoon of the 16th, one at 8:00 AM on the 17th, and two around 10:00 AM on the 17th, one of which crashed straight down, emitting black smoke.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the morning of the 16th, the Japanese air force surrounded and attacked an enemy mobile unit southeast of the Japanese mainland, severely damaging one large enemy warship (believed to be an aircraft carrier) of an unspecified type, causing a major fire. Furthermore, considerable damage was inflicted on other warships.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces War Results Around Iwo Jima: Five Enemy Warships Sunk; Enemy Troops Attempting to Land Repelled <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:20 PM on the 17th: (1) Around 10:00 AM on the 17th, under cover of artillery bombardment, the enemy attempted to land on Iwo Jima. The Japanese garrison immediately repelled them. (2) Since the 16th, Japanese aircraft and garrison forces have attacked enemy warships around the island. Confirmed results are as follows: one battleship sunk, two cruisers sunk, two warships of unspecified type sunk, three landing transport ships destroyed, and ten aircraft shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy mobile units near Iwo Jima attempted to land on the Ninemoto Beach on the southwest coast of the island around 10:30 AM on the 17th. At that time, Japanese troops in that area immediately launched a fierce counterattack, driving the enemy forces back to the open sea. Shortly after, around 10:40 AM, the enemy changed direction and attempted to land on the Kamisato Beach on the southeast coast of the island. Japanese troops waiting in position inflicted heavy damage on these landing enemy forces and repelled them as well.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the 16th, a separate powerful fleet has been bombarding Iwo Jima with naval guns. Since the 17th, the bombardment of the island has become even more intense, with the intention of suppressing the Japanese garrison positions. The fleet attacking Iwo Jima seems to include transport convoys and landing craft carrying landing forces, and a considerably large convoy is prepared in the rear. This shows that the enemy's intention is to capture Iwo Jima. Since the fall of the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima has become the most important forward defense line in the Pacific theater. Its strategic significance is both important and great. Observing these enemy actions clearly indicates that their wounds in the seas of Taiwan and the Philippines seem to have healed, and their ability to deploy such a large naval force is also due to the assistance of the British fleet sailing in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Establish a Circular Stronghold on Iwo Jima</p>
<p>Iwo Jima, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In an effort to invade the Japanese mainland and secure a nearby base, the American enemy has been relentlessly bombing Iwo Jima day and night since the beginning of this year. On the 16th of this month, the enemy's ambition to land on the island was finally exposed. Around 7:00 AM on the 16th, the enemy launched multiple waves of giant fighter planes and carrier-based "Kamikaze" bombers, followed by naval gun bombardment from the southern sea. At that time, the reporter stood on the observation platform at the central high ground of the island, observing the enemy's situation, and learned that the enemy's force consisted of about one aircraft carrier, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, transport ships, and dozens of other vessels. These ships were divided into southwest directions, each with three ships. At the time, dark clouds were densely covered, and there was occasional light rain. In this misty environment, around 1:00 PM, the enemy's naval gun bombardment became more intense. At this time, under its cover, thirteen small landing craft gradually approached the island from a distance of about four kilometers from the coast. Japanese soldiers immediately fired heavy artillery, fiercely attacking the enemy. Around 3:00 PM, the enemy finally retreated to a distance of 20,000 to 30,000 meters. This may have been a preliminary battle to scout landing points. Iwo Jima is an island with a total length of 8.3 kilometers and a maximum width of 4.2 kilometers, making it a small island of 20 square kilometers. Half of it is mountainous terrain. Japanese soldiers have dug a circular stronghold around the island, and the morale of the entire army is extremely high. If the fierce enemy takes one step closer to the island, they will immediately experience a painful blow from the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - This year's agricultural harvest in Manchuria is no less than last year's, and the procurement work is progressing exceptionally smoothly. By the end of last year, its procurement performance had already exceeded the annual procurement volume of the previous year. By mid-February, it had increased by 20% compared to last year. This year's procurement target should be greatly exceeded. This will make a great contribution to the food supply and demand of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Shigemitsu, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, sent telegrams to Takebe, the Chief of General Affairs of Manchuria, and Huang Xing, the Minister of Agriculture, on the 6th, expressing congratulations and gratitude, and sincerely expressing respect for the efforts of the Manchurian officials and people.</p>
<h3 id="e4">If the Enemy Invades Our Country's Territory, They Will Suffer Even Greater Damage; Ling Xiao's Views on the War Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The war in the Pacific has now reached the decisive stage. The American enemy, disregarding major strategic taboos, extended supply lines and invaded the hinterland of East Asia. Through the heroic interception by the allied naval, land, and air forces, the enemy has fallen into an irrecoverable abyss. The one billion people of East Asia, without exception, share a common hatred of the enemy and strengthen their belief in inevitable victory. Recently, the American Secretary of War Stimson declared that they would attempt to land on the Chinese mainland, which aroused even greater anger among our entire nation. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Ling Xiao, the Minister of the Navy of the National Government, to inquire about his views on this decisive battle in the Pacific, what preparations the new Chinese Navy had made if the enemy landed on the Chinese mainland, and the current state of the navy's progress. Minister Ling provided detailed answers. The interview is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Allied Forces Have the Upper Hand in the Philippine Theater</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, the situation in the Philippine theater has become increasingly fierce. With the bloody battles fought by all officers and soldiers of the allied land, sea, and air forces, great victories have been achieved. What are the Minister's views on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, allied naval and air officers and soldiers have fought bravely against the enemy. Over the past three years, their brilliant achievements have shocked the people of the world. This kind of resolute and outstanding spirit is deeply admired by us. The American enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses from these blows, leading to a daily shortage of military supplies. The difficulty of their supply and the decline in production have made it difficult for them to cope. Now, the enemy has further disregarded major strategic taboos, trudged a long way, and deeply invaded the hinterland of East Asia, which is indeed a great mistake. Modern warfare is not about the gain or loss of one place or one city, but about being able to persistently deplete the enemy's main force. Therefore, although they were fortunate enough to land and occupy some islands in the Pacific, from a military point of view, they have little value. Currently, Manila in Luzon has been invaded by the enemy, but the allied officers and soldiers on the periphery are giving them a head-on blow, implementing a "war of attrition." Furthermore, according to my observation, modern warfare places more emphasis on aircraft than warships. At present, the production of allied aircraft is making rapid progress, so the strength of the naval combat forces is becoming stronger and stronger. Moreover, the allied support base is nearby, which is clear evidence that the allied forces are in an absolutely advantageous position.</p>
<p>Our New Navy is Standing By, Ready for Battle</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, American Secretary of War Stimson declared that they will land on the Chinese mainland in the future. What are the Minister's views on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) After investigating the enemy's operations in Luzon, they have repeatedly stated that the future is quite difficult. If they want to fight on the Chinese mainland in the future, they will need even more time and more supplies. Furthermore, since the allied forces launched the mainland offensive last year, the American plan to fight on the Chinese coast has been clearly shattered. And judging by the current situation, the enemy is currently exhausted. If they deeply invade our territory, they will inevitably suffer even greater damage. At the same time, our new navy is also standing by, ready to cooperate with the Japanese army and give them a head-on blow. All of our naval officers and soldiers have a strong determination to kill the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chongqing-Yan'an Negotiations Stall Again <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Negotiations for reconciliation between the Chongqing and Yan'an regimes have stalled again due to fundamental opposition between the two sides. Chongqing made concessions again on the 14th regarding the negotiations, but were rejected by Yan'an. The concessions had four points: (1) Recognition of the legal status of Yan'an. (2) Recognition of Yan'an representatives participating in the Military Commission. (3) To form a wartime cabinet, recognition of Yan'an and other party representatives participating in administration. (4) To review the supply and reorganization of the communist army, a committee would be organized by representatives from Yan'an, Chongqing, and the United States. According to telegrams from Chongqing, Zhou Enlai attacked the Chongqing regime when he left Chongqing, and many of his statements about the negotiations were inappropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Solving the People's Food Problem Requires Adequate Rationing: Opinions of Consulting Committee Member Feng Bingnan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>"I have always been concerned about the people's food problem. Since May of last year, as the people's food situation became increasingly serious and people's livelihoods were increasingly threatened, I volunteered, despite my own weakness, to present a detailed outline of fundamental solutions to the people's food problem and discuss countermeasures with the former municipal authorities and relevant parties, and have repeatedly offered opinions. Now, for the sake of Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and Director Liu of the Rationing Office being able to easily understand my humble opinions, I have specially selected and described the main points of the opinions I have put forward in July and August as follows:</p>
<p>Minimum Amount Required for Health</p>
<p>(1) The food control system is a measure that should be taken under the wartime system, but during the period of implementing control, the food rationing system must be implemented at the same time.</p>
<p>(2) The food control system is the right of the government to implement, and at the same time, the government should also fulfill its food rationing obligations. The so-called equality of rights and obligations, the two should not be neglected.</p>
<p>(3) The amount of food rationed should not be lower than the minimum amount required for the people's health, that is, the monthly or daily rationed amount must be equal to the minimum amount required for the people's health.</p>
<p>(4) The minimum amount required for the people's health. When I advocated the implementation of the rationing system to the former Public Works Bureau several years ago, I asked them to study the habits of our people and the minimum amount required for their health. As a result, they believed that each person needs one pound of rice per day on average per year. According to our country's weights and measures, each person needs about 1.8 dou per month. This has already been discounted based on the habits of our people. There is a folk proverb in our country that "big mouths and small mouths, three dou per month," which means that on average, each person needs three dou per month (see page 355 of Chinese Rural Economy). At the same time, it must also be taken into account that people who use physical labor consume a lot, and 1.8 dou per month is still far from sufficient.</p>
<p>Military Provisions and People's Food are Equally Important</p>
<p>(5) Under the wartime system, military provisions are certainly important, but people's food should also be given equal importance. Special priority rationing for military police and other public officials is undoubtedly beyond reproach, and the people dare not ask for anything extravagant in this regard. However, rationing at the minimum amount required for health should be the priority of priorities. Before implementing priority rationing, it is necessary to ensure that the minimum needs of the general public and military police are adequately rationed before it can be implemented. Due to the need to survive, the people have no choice but to demand equal treatment for the rationing of the minimum amount of food they need.</p>
<p>(6) Whether in times of war or peace, the health of the people is closely related to the survival of the nation. Protecting the survival of the people is the primary task of any country. Even prisoners who have been sentenced to death by the state law, the state still has the responsibility to provide for them before their execution.</p>
<p>Insufficient Rationing Affects</p>
<p>(7) Since the implementation of the control system in this city, the amount of food rationed has never been sufficient to meet the minimum needs of the people, causing the powerful to flock to the black market to replenish, which has led to soaring black market prices. In addition, the rationing date is often inaccurate, and there are occasional delays without supplementary rationing, which creates more opportunities for the black market to be rampant. As a result, farmers seek better prices and tend to sell on the black market, which greatly affects the procurement work of the control agency.</p>
<p>(8) The success or failure of food control depends entirely on whether the amount of food rationed is sufficient or not, which is its most important key.</p>
<p>(9) Assuming that the 1.8 dou per month per person that I have always advocated is implemented, I firmly believe that although the black market cannot be completely eliminated, its threat to people's livelihoods and its hindrance to the function of control will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(10) The country's food policy should adopt a policy of high grain prices for farmers and a policy of low grain prices for the people. What is a policy of high grain prices? That is, to increase procurement prices, adding a legal profit in addition to considering the cost of farmers, in order to encourage their production. What is a policy of low grain prices? That is, to suppress rationing prices, taking into account the purchasing power of the general public, and strive to make it sufficient to maintain the lives of individuals and their families, so as to avoid freezing and starvation. The difference between the two should be compensated by taxes. If it can be successfully promoted, it will surely achieve the effect of national wealth and a strong people.</p>
<p>(11) The procurement of food should implement a unified system. There are too many units of procurement personnel from the control association. During wartime, there are few sellers of food and many seekers, and supply and demand cannot be balanced. How can rice prices not rise?</p>
<p>Rationing of Other Necessities</p>
<p>(12) Other items such as fuel oil and salt are also daily necessities. Once they have been controlled, they must be rationed. Now, coal and oil have not been rationed for a long time, and even if they are rationed, the quantity is still very small. Salt has never been rationed even once.</p>
<p>(13) Water is also an indispensable item for the people. During wartime, there may be a shortage of raw materials needed for water production, but the amount of water used by the people cannot be restricted too low, especially for the so-called alley houses, where there are many households and a large population. Too low a water restriction not only greatly affects the health of the people, but also falls far short of the tasks that public utilities themselves should fulfill, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>(14) Since the supply of fuel coal is scarce, other fuels such as firewood and charcoal should be rationed. The importance of fuel and water is equal. Without either, people can hardly survive. If there is a shortage of coal, other fuels such as firewood and charcoal should be supplied to meet the people's living needs first, and the use of industry and transportation equipment should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Summarizing the Opinions Held</p>
<p>Now, the above points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Minimum needs.</p>
<p>(2) Other controlled goods should be rationed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) The price of rationed goods should take into account the purchasing power of the general public.</p>
<p>(4) Food rationing must be on time.</p>
<p>(5) Fuel should be supplied to meet the people's living needs first.</p>
<p>(6) Food procurement should be unified.</p>
<p>(7) Before implementing priority rationing, the general public should first obtain the minimum amount required for health.</p>

<p>Philippine Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy naval and air forces fiercely bombarded and bombed Corregidor Island several times. On the morning of the 16th, an enemy airborne force suddenly landed on Corregidor Island. In response, dozens of enemy landing craft also landed with enemy troops. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place on the south side of the island.</p>

<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e8">Impressions of Attending the Advisory Council Meeting <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Council held its 13th plenary committee meeting. Since Mayor Zhou took office, the Advisory Council has convened one temporary plenary meeting to discuss the purchase of 100,000 piculs of affordable rice. Mayor Zhou did not attend due to official business. Therefore, yesterday's plenary meeting was also the first time Mayor Zhou attended the Advisory Council's plenary meeting. Therefore, the colleagues who attended felt particularly hopeful.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou delivered a report at the meeting (the full text can be found on the second edition of this newspaper today). The report lasted a full hour, and from beginning to end, the atmosphere was tense. From start to finish, he did not relax for a single moment. Mayor Zhou is still recovering from a new illness, and by the latter half of his speech, he was sweating profusely. When he spoke of touching points, the speaker almost shed tears, and the listeners were also deeply moved. Therefore, I think this report should not only be read carefully by all citizens, but I also hope that the current authorities of the allied nations can take the time to read it.</p>
<p>This report is divided into two main parts: one is about internal rectification, and the other is about the focus of facilities. Whether it is internal rectification or the focus of facilities, it can be said that they are all very concise, very practical, and very frank. Standing from the perspective of citizens, we wholeheartedly support them. The first point of the report on internal rectification is to reduce the organization, based on the principle of simplification, merging and cutting back. However, two additional agencies should be added as needed: one is the County Administration Office, and the other is the Population Evacuation Committee. This further indicates that the reduction of organizations and the establishment of organizations are entirely based on factual needs, and are by no means superficial decorations. The County Administration Office is a dedicated management agency to promote the city's counties, which is essential to strengthen the outer perimeter. The newspaper's editorials have repeatedly pointed this out, such as the article "Promoting the Model Area of the Seven Counties of Shanghai" on July 28 last year, "Sincere Talk about the Current Situation of the County Areas of the City and Subsequent Thoughts" on September 18, and "The Seven Counties of Shanghai Should be Adjusted" on January 23 of this year, consistently arguing for the importance of the city's county administration. Secondly, the issue of evacuating the population is an urgent requirement of the current situation, and it is also necessary to establish a special committee to preside over the matter. The newspaper's editorials have also discussed this several times, such as the article "The Problem of Shanghai Population Evacuation" on December 26 of last year, "Livelihood Issues and Population Evacuation" on January 14 of this year, "The First Thing in the New Year" on February 4, and "Population Evacuation and Restriction of Entry" on February 15, all emphasizing the necessity of evacuation and the steps to be taken. Observing from these places, the public opinion and the government's policies have already achieved a unified direction, which is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou quoted what Zeng Wenzheng said: "What the state and county consider small matters are the big matters of the people." This is a demonstration of making a fresh start with the people and sympathizing with their difficulties. Simply put, municipal administration is about serving the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the lives of the citizens and alleviate their suffering. The most important thing is to stabilize people's livelihoods. From the citizens' point of view, they should of course save resources, and all clothing, food, and other daily necessities should be economized as much as possible. From the government's point of view, it should do its best to provide the minimum satisfaction. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities of the allied nations can also provide the greatest cooperation.</p>
<p>The report also said: "To do a cause, the first thing is to think of a way, the second thing is to have a way, and the third thing is to make it work." I think that the points of focus of facilities listed by Mayor Zhou in the report have fully demonstrated that he has achieved the first step of thinking of a way and the second step of having a way. The question that remains is how to make it work. I believe that the municipal government is determined to make it work, and the citizens will also be determined to cooperate in making it work. At the same time, if we can get the greatest cooperation from the current authorities of the allied nations, we will definitely achieve the goal of making it work, and there will be nothing that cannot be done. However, in recent times, it cannot be said that there have been innovations in all aspects of municipal administration. However, the most fundamental problem of stabilizing people's livelihoods has not been solved. In other words, if the most important issue of rice and grain in people's livelihoods cannot be properly resolved, then all talk of stabilizing people's livelihoods will be nothing more than empty words, and the distance to eliminating the suffering of the citizens will be even greater.</p>
<p>We consistently advocate that the military should be the first priority at present, but in order to achieve the goal of military first, we cannot ignore the responsibility of politics. If we can achieve the minimum level of stability in people's livelihoods, then politics can play a role and military affairs can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, even if it is not a waste of effort, it will certainly be a case of getting half the result with twice the effort. We hope that the wise authorities of China and Japan will fully reflect on this and fully cooperate to move towards the most correct goal.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Memorial Stone to Be Erected Before the Tomb of Late Chairman Wang; Central Standing Committee Resolution Passed <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Today, the 17th, marks the hundredth day of mourning for the late Chairman Wang. The Central Standing Committee resolved to collect funds to erect a stone memorial archway at his tomb and to solicit plum blossoms to be planted around the tomb, as an expression of mourning. As Chairman Wang's burial proceeded, comrades and family members strictly adhered to his last words, that those who wished to commemorate him could plant a few plum trees around the tomb. Therefore, Chairman Wang's burial was managed entirely by his family, and no national funds were used in the construction of the tomb. This is both the comrades' adherence to Chairman Wang's last words and the fulfillment of his great wish. However, Chairman Wang led the comrades in revolution for decades, and his sudden demise caused grief throughout the world. Although the comrades勉遵(reluctantly obey) his last words, they deeply desired to have some form of memorial. Recently, comrades have been requesting to raise funds to erect a stone memorial archway in front of Chairman Wang's tomb, as an expression of mourning. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, the Central Standing Committee resolved that comrades should freely contribute funds to expedite this project. However, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of comrades in the party, to prevent any one person from donating excessively and potentially causing regret for their dependents, it was specifically resolved that each person's donation should not exceed ten thousand yuan. It is hoped that every comrade can fulfill their admiration. Furthermore, comrades who have white, red, green, or light red plum blossoms and wish to donate them to be planted around Chairman Wang's tomb may notify the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters so that they can be transplanted at a specific time.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Battle for Breslau Begins; Street Fighting in Sagan <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Hsin Tung News Agency reports: The battle for Breslau has begun. Soviet forces are launching multiple local advances from the west and east. It appears that after concentrating troops around Breslau, the Soviet forces have decided to engage in a decisive battle to seize the city. Soviet forces are currently heavily shelling the German defense lines there. Only on the western side of Breslau, after heavy shelling, have Soviet forces managed to break into the village of Kleintinz. Southeast of Liegnitz, the Soviet forces attempted to break into the German defense positions yesterday but were heavily repulsed by the German forces. After recapturing Schmottseifen, German forces have now also retaken Naumburg.</p>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 17th: Hsin Tung News Agency reports: A German military spokesman stated that the Soviet vanguard advancing towards Forst has been cut off by German forces.

Measures: (1) The Rice Control Committee should designate the locations for storing rationed rice for Shanghai, and the City Government should handle the transportation (by waterway or by rail). (2) Six months should be designated as a key period for implementing and testing focused rationing. During this period, general rationing should also be maintained on time and in the correct quantity. After implementing focused rationing, those not subject to focused rationing should be able to purchase rice at a fair price. The resolution was passed and a letter will be sent to the City Government to consult with relevant agencies. (2) The motion to evacuate students from schools in the city, urging the Education Bureau to prepare in advance, and the motion to reduce the city's population by limiting the entry of people from other areas were discussed together.

<p>City Government Secretary-General Luo received a Japanese press corps from the local Shanghai Japanese-language newspaper at 11:30 AM yesterday (the 17th) and gave a talk on measures to suppress prices and implement administrative streamlining, saying:</p>
<p>Countermeasures for Suppressing Prices</p>
<p>(1) The City Government will follow the central government's regulations and policies to suppress prices. The new price limits for the sixteen major commodities set by the Price Review Committee will soon be announced. The City Government is also planning to negotiate with relevant parties to find ways to open up sources of supplies along the railway lines. This is currently being planned. In the future, those who artificially drive up prices will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Levying Special Consumption Tax on Racecourses</p>
<p>(2) The special consumption tax on the city's Jai Alai and dog racing venues has been levied since February 1st. The City Government will implement skillful methods of collecting this tax. It has also requested the Ministry of Finance to transfer the collection of the special consumption tax on horse racing to the City Government.</p>
<p>Merger of Public Utilities Bureau and Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>(3) Due to frequent conflicts of authority between the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Works Bureau in the past, it has been decided to merge them from March 1st to achieve administrative streamlining. The new bureau will be named the Construction Bureau. It is rumored that the position of director will be assumed by Xu Jitun, the current director of the Public Utilities Bureau. Therefore, the City Government's reorganization of institutions and implementation of administrative streamlining will be completed within February.</p>

<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate illegal elements at the North Station and fundamentally improve order, thereby ensuring the safety and convenience of legitimate travelers, the City Police Bureau has established the Shanghai Branch Bureau at 29 Jiaotong Road. All parties have high expectations for this. Yesterday, reporters visited the branch bureau's director, Liu Zhenzhong, and deputy director, Takura Shigeo, who received them and announced the bureau's future work guidelines. The poor conduct of Shanghai station police, railway employees, and others in the past has aroused resentment among citizens. At the beginning of the branch bureau's establishment, it will uphold a spirit of self-discipline and self-restraint, eliminating past injustices and establishing the Shanghai station as a true station for the people. No matter what obstacles are encountered, it will strive to eliminate them in order to achieve its goals. Regarding internal rectification: (1) Strictly prevent police officers from accepting bribes, engaging in illegal extortion, and other misconduct, and strengthen supervision and guidance. (2) Strictly enforce police discipline. Regarding external rectification: (1) Crack down on the misconduct of railway employees, (2) Crack down on black market train tickets, (3) Crack down on smuggling of prohibited and controlled goods, (4) Crack down on "ticket scalpers," prohibit irrelevant people from entering and exiting the station, and secretly investigate people loitering near the station to eliminate all illegal intentions, (5) Strictly prevent theft and smuggling of goods within the station.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Match and Soap Rationing Office of the Daily Necessities Control Committee has recently discovered that some retailers are selling inferior matches with the "Hundred Deer" brand distributed through the Consolidated Ticket No. 38. These retailers are mixing inferior matches or broken sticks into the matchboxes, or deliberately reducing the number of matches in the boxes, causing losses to citizens. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens who discover such situations will report the retailer's name and address and the circumstances to the office. If the reports are verified, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>Extension Deadline</p>
<p>The household match rationing for Ticket No. 38 issued by the City Goods Rationing Office was originally scheduled to end on the 10th of this month. However, to facilitate citizens during the Spring Festival, it was extended to the 20th of this month. As the deadline is approaching, it is hoped that citizens will not delay further, as no further extensions will be granted after this deadline.</p>

<p>Focused Rationing Already Implemented</p>
<p>(1) (Question) When will focused rationing be implemented? Will other items besides rice, such as flour, oil, sugar, and coal briquettes, be included? (Answer) Focused rice rationing was implemented in January. The inclusion of other items such as flour, oil, sugar, and coal briquettes depends on the availability of supplies.</p>
<p>Household Rice to Be Rationed Soon</p>
<p>(2) (Question) Household rice has not been rationed for several periods, leading to rumors of a halt to rationing, which is causing anxiety among the general public. Can it be expected that it will be rationed as usual soon? Will the quantity be increased or decreased? (Answer) There is no truth to the rumor that household rice rationing will be stopped. However, due to transportation difficulties, we are doing our best to resolve them. If supplies can be transported soon, they will be rationed as usual, and the quantity should not be reduced.</p>
<p>Negotiations Underway for Rationing Daily Necessities</p>
<p>(3) (Question) In the past, the rationing of general daily necessities in the city has often not been implemented on schedule. How does your office plan to adjust this in the future? (Answer) We are currently negotiating with relevant parties to adjust the rationing of daily necessities.</p>

<h3 id="e31">First Report to the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Fo Hai</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee was originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, but was temporarily suspended due to my illness. I fully expected to recover in a few days, so it was rescheduled for the 10th. Little did I know that my condition would worsen in the interim, and it had to be postponed until today. I am truly very sorry.</p>
<p>In the past, the Advisory Committee has been very cooperative and helpful to the Municipal Government, and I deeply admire that. As the situation becomes more serious and the work becomes more difficult, more and greater efforts will be required. Therefore, I hope that the Advisory Committee will cooperate even more than in the past.</p>
<p>Regarding the future policy and spirit of administration, I have already mentioned them in my public notice to the citizens, so I will not repeat them. Today, I will briefly report on the work to be done between February and June, a period of five months. Detailed outlines are explained in the work plans of each bureau and department. Now, I will only explain the important points, which are our central tasks.</p>
<p>My report is divided into two parts: internal rectification of the municipal government and the key points of general facilities.</p>
<p>Four Key Points for Internal Rectification</p>
<p>Regarding internal rectification, the first is to reduce the size of the organization. In the past, the Municipal Government was formed by the merger of three parties, so the organization was very large and complex. This not only wasted funds, but also reduced the ability to handle affairs, obscured responsibilities, and unclear authority. People would compete for advantages but would defer to one another when problems arose. Moreover, a single official matter often had to be stamped by more than a dozen people before it could be issued. Such laxity and delay could not cope with the current rapidly changing situation. Therefore, the organization must be simplified. For example, the merger of the Public Works Bureau and the Engineering Bureau into the Construction Bureau, the unification of the three treasuries into one, the transformation of the Special Consumption Tax Office and the General Accounting Office into departments, the merger of various departments of the Police Bureau, the abolition of the Land and Housing Management Committee for Owners Not Present and the Property Management Committee for Chongqing Assets, and the elimination or merger of various departments and sections of other bureaus and offices are all based on this principle. However, two new organizations are being added contrary to this need: the County Administration Office and the Population Evacuation Committee. In the past, the counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality did not have a dedicated management agency, which made it impossible to advance county administration, so a special office was established to promote it. Evacuating the population is an urgent matter at present, but the work is arduous, so a committee must be established to oversee it. However, for the two new organizations, the number of people used by the County Administration Office is limited to a very small extent, and the people who handle affairs for the Population Evacuation Committee are entirely seconded.</p>
<p>The second is to eliminate unnecessary redundant staff. In the current urgent situation, it stands to reason that two people should eat one person's meal, and one person should do the work of two people. Although we are reluctant to ask or force two people to eat one person's meal, we very much hope that one person will do the work of two people. The Municipal Government now has too many staff, on the contrary, two people do one person's work, or even three people do one person's work, and there are still people who have nothing to do. The total number of people in the Municipal Government, according to the approved quota, is 42,930. Among them, in addition to more than 15,000 in the Police Bureau and more than 11,000 in the Security Command, there are more than 15,900 other personnel. With so many people, there are of course many who have nothing to do. If an organization has many people who have nothing to do, the overall spirit will inevitably be lax, and discipline will inevitably be neglected. As for wasting huge sums of money, that is secondary. In order to improve administrative efficiency, save money, and increase the treatment of capable personnel, it is planned to gradually reduce the original number by one-third. We know very well that this move will inevitably cause many disputes and reactions, but we have made a great determination to implement it.</p>
<p>The third is to enforce discipline. This can be divided into two points: to prohibit corruption and to rectify morale. There is no need to go into detail about the past discipline. In the future, we plan to closely monitor the actions of civil servants. If we find anyone who uses their power to engage in malpractice for personal gain, they will be handed over to the Special Court or the Security Command for punishment under military law. However, Shanghai is a den of all evils, and we know that many civil servants do not solicit bribes, but the other party offers bribes to entice them. In the future, we will adhere to the principle of punishing both givers and receivers. Those who offer bribes will also be dealt with under military law. As for rectifying morale, the goal is to handle affairs quickly and to fundamentally eliminate the habit of not discussing conditions and delaying official business. Other habits of procrastination and shelving must also be thoroughly corrected. If an organization does not handle affairs quickly, it will cause great suffering to subordinate organizations, especially to the people. Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "What the state and county consider minor matters are major matters for the people." If the responsible personnel lightly shelve the people's requests, it will cause great inconvenience or loss to the people. In the future, the Secretariat will designate special personnel to assess the speed of handling official business in various bureaus and offices in order to ensure promptness.</p>
<p>The fourth is to improve treatment. To ensure the integrity of civil servants, it is necessary to improve their treatment, which need not be discussed further. In the future, we will do our best to improve the treatment of civil servants as much as our financial resources allow. However, I must frankly say that the speed and extent of the improvement in treatment will never keep up with the speed and extent of price increases. The amount of the increase will certainly not be as much as the money obtained through corruption. But we will certainly do our best to improve it. It has now been decided that the lowest monthly ration for civil servants is three dou of rice, with a salary of more than 18,000 yuan. The lowest monthly ration for unmarried police officers in the urban area is two and a half dou of rice, with a salary of more than 12,000 yuan. Because prices are lower in the suburbs and rural areas, the lowest monthly ration for soldiers in the Security Team is three dou of rice, with a salary of 5,000 yuan. With such increases, we know very well that it cannot be considered adequate, but it has already taken a great deal of effort. As a result, the total monthly increase in salaries and rice prices has reached more than 700 million yuan. If prices rise too much in the future, we are prepared to gradually increase them.</p>
<p>Focus of General Facilities</p>
<p>The above is a report on the key points of internal rectification of the Municipal Government. Now, I will report on the focus of general facilities.</p>
<p>The first is to reorganize finances. To improve the treatment of civil servants and to carry out undertakings, money is indispensable. Therefore, if there is no way to manage finances, nothing can be started from the ground up. However, I am unwilling to suddenly increase the burden on the people too much. Therefore, the first thing to do is to eliminate embezzlement. The amount of money that the people have already paid but the government has not received in the past is truly astonishing. If all the embezzled money goes to the government, the burden on the people will not increase, but the government's revenue will increase. The second is to strictly prohibit tax evasion. Cunning merchants often use clever methods to evade the taxes they should pay. In the future, we will conduct strict investigations, both overt and covert, to ensure that tax evasion is prohibited. Recently, several entertainment venues were found to have evaded taxes and have been fined leniently. In the future, they will be severely punished. This is not to increase the burden on the people, but to require the people not to evade the obligation to pay taxes. In this regard, there can also be a considerable increase in revenue. The recent increase in special consumption tax in the past three weeks has demonstrated the effect of reorganization. The third is to adjust tax rates. In the past, because many tax rates were not uniform or reasonable, tax collectors and taxpayers could collude, or taxpayers felt inconvenient, which resulted in a decrease in revenue. In the future, we will unify tax categories that are not uniform, such as those in the old one and eight districts, and we will submit requests to the central government to adjust tax rates that are not in line with the current situation, such as the banquet tax rate. Tax rates such as property tax and land tax should also be adjusted to reflect the current situation. Adjusting tax rates can also increase revenue. The fourth is to introduce new taxes. The increase in expenditure is too large, and the increase in revenue from the above three methods alone cannot make up for it. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new taxes. The business tax that the former mayor planned to introduce in the old one and eight districts this spring is still in progress, and taxes such as advertising tax are also being planned. In short, in terms of finance, we strive for a balance between revenue and expenditure and do not want to have a deficit.</p>
<p>The second is to stabilize people's livelihood. I have no confidence in how much of this task can be achieved. Because to stabilize people's livelihood, it is necessary to stabilize prices and ensure sufficient distribution. However, to achieve these two goals, the municipal government must have a considerable amount of materials in its hands. Otherwise, it is impossible to achieve the goals. Some citizens do not understand this principle. They blame the municipal government for the high price of rice, for the failure to distribute goods on time, and for the reduction in electricity supply. These things are also the responsibility of the municipal government. However, everyone knows that the municipal government is empty-handed. The purchase of materials is not under the control of the municipal government, the distribution of materials is not under the control of the municipal government, the transportation of materials is not under the control of the municipal government, and the storage of materials is not under the control of the municipal government. Even if the municipal authorities have a sincere heart, they are really just empty-handed. With a sincere heart and a pair of empty hands, how can they lower prices and ensure full and timely distribution? Unless they have the ability to turn stone into gold, even gods have no way. All we can do is pitifully implore various material control agencies to dredge up sources of supply, to allocate goods to us on time, and not to raise distribution prices excessively. But here, despite our best efforts to speak and beg, the control agencies with authority also state their difficult reasons and cannot agree to our requests. The municipal government cannot perform magic and has no ability to create something out of nothing. What can we do? Therefore, being blamed by the citizens is really unfair. In the days before and after I took office, the price of rice stabilized slightly, and everyone attributed it to me, saying that the price of rice fell because I became the mayor. This was a coincidence and was definitely not my credit. I would never dare to take the credit of heaven as my own. The other day, the price of rice suddenly rose. If the responsibility for this is to be borne entirely by the empty-handed municipal government, it would be too harsh.</p>
<p>However, we will never shirk our responsibility. In the past, there have been cases where prices have soared due to improper measures taken by the municipal government, and there have also been cases where the distribution of goods has been delayed or deducted. We have the responsibility and the power to correct these malpractices. Therefore, although we cannot actively improve the lives of citizens because we are empty-handed, we will certainly strive to reduce or even eliminate unnecessary burdens, losses, and suffering suffered by citizens.</p>
<p>Resolutely Preventing Artificially Inflated Prices</p>
<p>During wartime, rising prices are inevitable. No country can prevent it. However, in addition to natural economic reasons, there are also artificial manipulation reasons in Shanghai. Therefore, the rise in prices is particularly drastic. For example, if prices should rise to ten due to natural reasons, they rise to a hundred or several hundred in Shanghai due to artificial reasons. Also, if prices should rise once a month due to natural reasons, they rise once every ten days or eight days, or even three days or five days in Shanghai due to artificial reasons. Because the municipal government is just empty-handed, it is frankly at a loss when it comes to price increases caused by natural and irresistible reasons. However, we are determined to make efforts to prevent price increases caused by artificial reasons. For example, if prices should only rise to ten, they will not be allowed to rise to a hundred or several hundred. If prices should only rise once a month, they will not be allowed to rise once every seven days or eight days, or three days or five days. The first thing we need to do is to improve the Price Review Committee. The past review committee was not an agency to prevent price increases, but an agency to promote price increases. Merchants and responsible personnel could collude to raise the official price. For example, before the new and old economic bureaus took over, they fired a lot of parting shots, perhaps raising the prices of some goods above what the merchants in the industry hoped for. This type of situation must be eliminated in the future. We plan to invite fair and honest experts to participate in the review, and we will also strictly select and supervise administrative personnel to ensure that the Price Review Committee can play a role in suppressing and stabilizing prices. The second thing to do is to register goods and their movements to prevent hoarding. Frankly speaking, hoarding and speculation are the main artificial reasons for rising prices. In the future, if such a situation is investigated, we will punish those who are seriously involved under military law for the benefit of the majority of citizens. However, in the past, many economic police or economic bureau personnel who investigated factories and shops took the opportunity to demand bribes. The government's investigation of an item provides these people with an opportunity to profit. Therefore, the citizens did not benefit from the crackdown on hoarding or the investigation of prices, but these people benefited first. In the future, this type of behavior will be strictly prohibited. Once discovered, both givers and receivers will be punished. Those who are seriously involved will be shot without mercy. It is my character that I will definitely carry out what I say. I am not trying to scare people. However, I am afraid that my eyes and ears are not everywhere and I cannot discover everything. I hope that the members of the Advisory Committee can secretly help to report, and I also hope that the general public will be responsible for reporting. The names of informers will be kept absolutely secret. However, we will not accept irresponsible anonymous letters. The third is to reorganize the various industry associations. If the various industry associations are sound, they can also use autonomous methods to make their members self-disciplined. Otherwise, they can use the collective actions of the associations to monopolize and speculate. Therefore, strengthening trade associations is also an indispensable means of suppressing prices. In short, we want to eradicate artificially inflated prices, and we want to earnestly implement the various laws and regulations promulgated by the central government to suppress prices, especially the emergency measures for price control promulgated on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Regarding distribution, the general public certainly hopes that the amount will be increased and that the distribution will be on time. Not only do the citizens hope so, but we also hope so and are working hard to achieve it. However, the municipal government itself has nothing. As I said before, it is empty-handed. Therefore, we can only make the greatest efforts to negotiate with the parties that own and distribute materials, asking them to increase the amount and issue it on time. As for whether we can do it, the power does not lie with the municipal government, so we cannot guarantee it. However, we will distribute the materials received from all parties in the most prompt and fair manner. We will not allow delays, demands, deductions, or adulteration. The municipal government will distribute as much as it receives to the citizens. We will refuse extra distribution to powerful people without regard for their feelings. Because the amount is fixed, if powerful people get more distribution, it will inevitably reduce the distribution that ordinary citizens should get. This kind of unfair thing is absolutely not allowed. If there is any malpractice in distribution, we also hope that the members of the Advisory Committee will help to report it, and we also hope that the general public will be responsible for reporting it.</p>
<p>Establishing Security in Urban and Rural Areas</p>
<p>The third is to maintain law and order. To maintain law and order, we must first ensure that the military and police responsible for maintaining law and order do not harass the people themselves. If this minimum requirement cannot be met, what else is there to talk about in terms of peace and security? But in the past, the people were not only afraid of bandits, but also afraid of the military and police. Sometimes, they were even more afraid of the military and police than of bandits. They thought that if they were robbed by illegal bandits, they could still sue. But if they were extorted by bandits in legal clothing, they would not dare to sue, because the military and police who were sued would take revenge in the future. So they suffered in silence and dared not speak out. Under these circumstances, why does the country need the military and police, and why do the people need the military and police? Therefore, to maintain law and order, we must first rectify the discipline of the military and police. After this considerable improvement in treatment, we will severely punish military and police who demand bribes to ensure the peace of society. I am very happy and comforted that the police officers in the urban area are very self-respecting and self-restrained. The phenomenon of extortion along the way has been very rare recently. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the members of the Advisory Committee for raising huge sums of money to reward them. As a leader, it is naturally very pleasant to see his subordinates making such progress. However, we must first make sure that this good phenomenon continues, and second, we must extend it to the suburbs and rural areas.</p>
<p>Now, due to the situation, the law and order situation in the suburbs, especially in the rural areas, is deteriorating day by day. Therefore, strengthening the strength of the military and police is also something that must be done at present. I adopt the principle of elite soldiers, not seeking an increase in quantity, but seeking soundness in quality. On the one hand, we are eliminating unnecessary military and police adjutants and subordinates. At the same time, we must strengthen the training of police officers who actually perform the responsibility of maintaining law and order, and supplement the combat troops who actually fight. For the law and order in the urban area, we will assign the police to conduct open and secret investigations to prevent and control incidents before they happen. If an incident does occur, we will definitely assign them to solve the case within a short period of time after the incident. For the bandits and scattered bandits in the suburbs and rural areas, we will assign security teams and security police teams to gradually eliminate them. In the future, we will adhere to the principle of law and order first, strengthen the training of the military and police, strengthen the strength of the military and police, and give full play to the power of the military and police. Within the possible scope, we will make the greatest efforts to accomplish the task of establishing law and order.</p>
<p>Improving the Blockade Management Office</p>
<p>The fourth is to improve the Blockade Management Office. In the past, the extortion of the people by this office was worse than the likin in the past. It was heavily exploited and there were no standards. The villagers had suffering and had no way to complain. Originally, we planned to completely abolish the blockade, but the negotiations with the relevant parties have not yet been completed. Now, we want to reduce the number of people in the blockade office to the minimum, and also improve their treatment and strictly monitor them. If there are lawbreakers, they will be imprisoned for minor offenses and executed for serious offenses, in order to reduce the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>The above is a report on the key tasks for the next five months. As for other matters such as the reorganization and strengthening of education, the promotion of public health, the reorganization of urban traffic and city appearance, the repair and dredging of roads and ditches, the reorganization of land, and the implementation of social welfare and publicity activities, each bureau and office has a written plan outline report, so there is no need to make an oral report here one by one.</p>
<p>In the future, we will lead all members of the Municipal Government to carry out the established plans step by step. However, in such a serious, complex, and delicate environment, I am not fully confident that we can achieve the expected results. I also said at the last tea party to welcome people from all walks of life that in such a situation, we do not hope to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If we can achieve half the result with twice the effort, we will be very satisfied. The most we fear is toiling in vain. However, there are too many possibilities for toiling in vain. Because the passive obstruction is too great. For example, a plan that has just begun to take shape can be fundamentally shaken by news of a war thousands of miles away. Also, for example, a work that is planned very carefully can be completely stopped once it encounters a military necessity. There are many such things, and everyone understands them very well, so there is no need to go into detail. However, the colleagues of the Municipal Government will never shirk, evade, or abandon the responsibilities that we should bear because of these difficulties. Even if we cannot get things done, the greatest thing we can do is to do our best. I often think that to do a career, the first thing is to think of a way, the second thing is to have a way, and the third thing is to be able to do it. Not thinking of a way is not fulfilling one's responsibility. Not having a way means not having the ability. However, whether a way thought of by a capable and responsible person can be done depends not only on effort and ability, but also on the environment. No matter how great your ability is and no matter how hard you work, you cannot turn the tide under irresistible resistance. However, the general public will not think this way. They only know that you have not done things well, regardless of whether you have the ability, whether you have worked hard, or how great the resistance is and how bad the environment is. Therefore, we do not think about getting the general understanding of the citizens, and we do not have such a possibility. We only seek to use all our ability to be worthy of our conscience. Therefore, even if we are ashamed of public opinion, as long as we have no guilt in our hearts, we will be at ease. Today, in front of the members of the Advisory Committee, I frankly state our state of mind. I hope that the members will not only contribute their opinions as much as possible, but also actually assist in the implementation of various policies. Mayor Zhou reported on the seat of the Advisory Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Medical Service in the Hunan Battlefield <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshiyu Aoki</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Xinshi</p>
<p>The epidemic prevention team of the Hankou Medical Association Clinic received orders to depart for front-line service. On a certain day of a certain month, I, along with my assistant and clerk Taro Yoshida, and nurses Misses Shiro Matsuda and Shengjie Zhao, departed from the ○○ station.</p>
<p>After reorganizing the ranks at the ○○ Reconstruction Department, our service team sat in a corner of a heavy-duty truck loaded with provisions, advancing towards the front lines, covered in dust. On the makeshift roads, muddy after days of heavy rain, hundreds of vehicles wound their way, adorned with colorful camouflage, swaying and silently advancing.</p>
<p>During our ten-day wait for orders in Xinshi, we voluntarily requested to serve at the battlefield hospital established by the Kuwata unit during its trial period. The pathological laboratory became the temporary office for my assistant and me, while the surgical operating room and the officers' ward became the temporary workplaces for the two nurses. This was also battlefield service. We opened our medical kits, took out our makeshift diagnostic tools, and began examining the endless stream of dysentery stool samples and blood samples from typhoid patients. It had been a long time since Yoshida and I had done this kind of work. I recalled the time I learned about culturing bacteria from Professor Endo; it was five or ten years ago. It was in the bacteriology classroom at Daegu Medical College, and in the research lab at Nagasaki Medical University. Yoshida had been studying medicine with me since he was fourteen, and we have been inseparable ever since.</p>
<p>A few days before July 6th, Yoshida could no longer serve due to vomiting, diarrhea, and malaria. On the morning of the 6th, he seemed to be pushing himself, so I said to him:</p>
<p>"Yoshida! Let's go! We have a lot of material today!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing my greeting, he jumped up as if he had regained his strength. As I was organizing the records and Yoshida was watching the artificially incubated bacteria, we suddenly heard someone shouting about an air raid. We immediately sought shelter, only to find six North American B-24 Liberator enemy planes flying overhead. Minutes later, another alarm sounded, and we jumped into the air raid shelter to see three enemy planes circling at low altitude. We all lay motionless at the very back of the shelter. The booming explosions, the sharp sounds of shrapnel piercing the air, and the sounds of collapsing buildings all intertwined. After a few minutes, we climbed out of the wretched smoke and called for Yoshida, but there was no answer. According to a medic's report, we rushed to the stone wall near where the bomb had landed and found Yoshida lying in a pool of blood, with huge shrapnel wounds on his chest and back. The wounds were wide open, like blooming pomegranates. Fortunately, the wounds were still clean, with no dirt seeping in, and since he was still breathing, we determined that his chest cavity had not been damaged. In addition, there were shrapnel wounds piercing his thighs. He was completely weakened due to excessive bleeding, but his breathing was still good. We immediately injected hemostatic drugs, applied temporary bandages, and then transported him to the surgical operating room.</p>
<p>The scene in the surgical operating room was extremely tragic. The enemy planes targeted the hospital, which was flying a Red Cross flag, dropping ○○ bombs. One of the bombs hit the ward, killing and wounding ○○ front-line soldiers. So, this batch of bomb-wounded soldiers was sent to the operating room one by one. Yoshida couldn't bear to watch the severely wounded patients beside him. Still regarding himself as a doctor, he worked tirelessly, continuing to inject cardiotonic and hemostatic drugs into the other wounded soldiers until the emergency kit was completely depleted.</p>
<p>After sending Yoshida to the ward, I rushed to the Reconstruction Department dormitory to make contact. The narrow road was covered with debris from collapsed houses, leaving almost no room to set foot. To make matters worse, a major fire broke out along the way, with flames blocking our path. A bomb had struck the road beside the dormitory, completely destroying half of the building, especially the front of the second floor, which was in a deplorable state. Two or three staff members were picking up scattered items, but there was no one else around. Nurse Matsuda was injured by falling debris, and nurse Shengjie Zhao was blown off the second floor by the blast wave as she was walking down, resulting in a stab wound to her buttocks and pain all over her body.</p>
<p>That night, we all went to the small mountain on the north shore to seek refuge. The hospital also decided to move. Under the bright light of the fifteenth day of the lunar month, a winding line of stretcher teams and wounded soldiers walking on their own surrounded the mountain and turned. In the end, we all gathered in the inner part of the original location.</p>
<p>That night's air raid was even more intense than the daytime one. Less than an hour after our camp had been set up and the wounded soldiers had just gathered, American planes began strafing and bombing. In an attempt to turn Xinshi into a scorched earth, three or five planes began wave after wave of bombing. Taking advantage of the moonlight, every fifteen or twenty minutes, the enemy planes would fly low when the explosions subsided, even machine-gunning a truck or dropping parachute bombs on a small house. This was America's attempt to kill humans and animals alike. The wounded soldiers were dispersed in time, taking advantage of the terrain. We were all worried that if the enemy planes spotted so many immobile wounded soldiers, they would immediately destroy them. Each time the enemy planes came, we felt that kind of concern, but fortunately it never became a reality.</p>
<p>We set up mosquito nets by the river near the wounded soldiers' assembly point, beside a Chinese tomb. We rested briefly, wearing shoes and leggings, but we had to flee to the alarm again in no time. Due to the repeated evacuations, the dozen or so staff members simply scattered and lay down in suitable shelters. However, the only ones who remained in the original location were me, Lieutenant Yao, and the driver Zhubing. The place where the three of us were lying was a depression surrounded by three mounds of earth. Although it was on the slope where enemy planes were invading, they flew by four or five times, and we gradually became uneasy. This panic was due to the fact that the enemy planes sometimes flew straight towards us, and the bombing was indiscriminate. At the same time, the enemy planes had machine guns on their tails. Just when we thought the plane had flown past and we were relieved, the machine guns on the tail would start firing. The three of us immediately ducked our heads down. The constant attacks by the enemy planes exhausted us. When the air raid was completely lifted, we congratulated each other on still being alive.</p>
<p>This was a tragic night across the river from Xinshi. Heaven was truly against us, providing the enemy planes with convenience by having a full moon in the sky. The abandoned city of Xinshi was left to be incinerated by incendiary bombs, and a strong wind started up, causing the fire dragon to rage everywhere. As we were watching, a corner of the temple wall suddenly collapsed, and sparks flew everywhere in the black smoke. The enemy planes were annoying and came to bomb again. This time, the bombing target was far away from us. We glared angrily at the enemy planes as they dropped bomb after bomb. In the distance, inverted isosceles triangular pillars of fire appeared and disappeared at equal intervals.</p>
<p>After a while, the air raid passed, and an odorous silence descended. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we moved again in search of a suitable location, followed by roll call and mutual greetings. Just as I was about to doze off in a blanket, I heard a woman's soft voice shout: "Mr. Matsuda!" It seemed to be the Chinese nurse, Miss Zhao, calling her companion. But there was no sound of Matsuda answering.</p>
<p>"Mr. Matsuda is not here, please come over here!" someone replied.</p>
<p>"Hello! Hello!"</p>
<p>"Where to?" As they talked, the Chinese nurse was led by the hand to the small mountain by a soldier who showed her kindness.</p>
<p>The depression where the three of us were lying had now become four. At this time, the air raid came again, flying to the front in the blink of an eye and dropping countless bombs, causing sand and rocks to fly and the sky to darken. After another two or three rounds of aircraft attacks, this Chinese woman said impatiently: "Sir, I don't want to be on the front lines, I want to go back to Hankou." I replied: "This is war! You and I are here to fight, this is what your former Chairman Wang said about living and dying together! Cheer up, despair is useless." Afterwards, we encountered dozens of bombings, and I always stayed close to Miss Zhao, fleeing together, or collapsing in a small cave, or the two of us squatting tightly in an air raid shelter. But later she remained silent until the beginning of November, when she finally completed her mission and left Changsha. Shengjie Zhao was educated by the Medical Association and then served in the Medical Association Hospital for five years. During this period, she was deeply influenced by the Japanese spirit, and this time she followed the army to fight the Chongqing army, wearing a military uniform and living the life of a Japanese soldier. Her thoughts and emotions were completely in line with ours Japanese people. After completing the medical treatment, she carried out pacification work among the Chinese people in the occupied areas, and did a great job for us Japanese. Because she had the feelings of the same nation, she could also serve as a translator for our Japanese soldiers who charged into battle, she was truly a treasure in our Japanese army. It can be said that she was the most effective Chinese person among the personnel in this battlefield service.</p>
<p>Tears of the Coolie</p>
<p>The once bustling streets are now deserted, with doors tightly closed, goods and furniture removed, leaving only the magnificent signs and decorations. This is the Westernized city of Changsha. Strolling on the road in a leisurely manner are only we Japanese, handling important official business. Every mile or half mile, there are well-arranged fire points. I thought they would be good shelters during air raids, but upon entering, I found many dead bodies, or sick and wounded lying down, and cluttered, dirty objects lined up. The trees on the road are still lush and shady, dividing the sidewalks on both sides. The traffic control platforms at the crossroads still stand tall.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Changsha on July 11th, the military facilities in the suburbs had been completely removed, and the traces of war in the city had been completely erased. Citizens gradually returned, and even the naked mannequins in the Western-style clothing stores were draped in beautiful clothes. The grocery stores displayed colorful glass water bottles, dazzlingly white shirts, a variety of ties, and socks. The pastry shops seemed to have displays of sugar-coated pastries and fried buns. At the vegetable market directly managed by the Reconstruction Department, we got up before dawn to buy fresh vegetables from the farmers who came in droves for the Japanese army. After finishing a bag of tobacco, these Chinese farmers bought rock salt back. Some bought some medicine from us to treat wounds, and some asked us to bandage their wounds. Some also bought quinine pills for their parents and wives. There are a lot of sparrows in Changsha in the morning. In fact, they are not all sparrows, but there are many birds with beautiful voices, and when dawn is about to come, they always happily call out a word or two outside the window.</p>
<p>The day after we arrived in Changsha, the sick and wounded began to come for treatment, so we temporarily used the office as a temporary clinic. The first patient was a Chinese coolie who had been injured by a landmine, so we immediately felt the smell of gunpowder on the battlefield. The others were ordinary menstrual pains. Due to the incomprehensible Chinese language and the gestures, laughter often broke out between us, and sometimes we mistook women for men. This was a morning scene at our clinic in Changsha at that time.</p>
<p>What destroyed this painting was the enemy air raid on the evening of July 16th. After the bombing subsided that night, I stood on the stone steps in front of the Reconstruction Department and looked into the distance, watching the dark, smoky fire. Sometimes flames like fire dragons occurred, mixed with sounds like firecrackers for the New Year. Gradually it got dark, but in the shadows, four or five people appeared, some hobbling with crutches, some with their arms in slings, carrying patients in on a door. So, I called out the two nurses to carry out the treatment. The third patient was a woman around forty years old, with a bullet wound through her shoulder, which also had a considerable impact on her lungs. When she was carried in front of us, she suddenly vomited and had diarrhea, and the fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl who was serving her began to cry loudly. After two injections, fortunately the vomiting of blood stopped, and her breathing gradually improved, so she was temporarily placed in a folk house in front of the door to lie down. Then I looked at the next patient, and accidentally glanced out the door, and the patient lying on that door panel had changed color. So I ordered the nurse to carry out emergency treatment, but when I went to get the injection kit, she was already dead. Although I gave her injections of cardiotonic, they had no effect. At that time, my Chinese language was unable to express my meaning, so I had to take out a piece of paper from my pocket and cover the face of the deceased. The girl immediately burst into tears. In this environment, I had to leave silently and go to see other patients.</p>
<p>The enemy's blind bombing also "visited" many times later. During the day, P-41 enemy planes came to侦察, which has almost become a daily routine. The largest-scale bombing was on July ○, that day almost entirely incendiary bombs, mainly to completely burn down the deserted houses by the river. Although the wounded were surprisingly few, although we were waiting to implement emergency treatment, but this time we saw that it was not bombing injuries at all, but fire injuries, so this time not only were more bandages used, but also more ointments were used. The bandages were war trophies snatched by the ○○ team. Among them were bandages from the Hong Kong Salvation Team and the Dagang Bao征募 or donations, which were later abandoned by the so-called salvation fighters, but now they fell into our hands, but they are saving the same Chinese people.</p>
<p>One moonlit night in mid-August, I was sleeping in a rattan chair in the bedroom when I was awakened by a creepy bomb explosion. It was probably because the lights were leaking out, and a dive bombing was carried out, but later nothing happened.</p>
<p>The next morning, I got up at the usual time and went to the well with a washbasin to fetch water. In front of the door shrouded in the morning mist stood a strange patient. This seems to be a ten-year-old child with an injured wrist. Upon closer inspection, there was a large wound from his left shoulder to his elbow, and he was hanging an arm full of blood with a rope.</p>
<p>"Airplane came, bang?" When I asked this, he seemed to understand what I meant. I asked again:</p>
<p>"Father mother no?"</p>
<p>He said emotionlessly, "Mother yes". What exactly does his mother do? I was thinking this in my heart, and led this blood-covered wounded person to the clinic.</p>
<p>Many wounded people gradually gathered in front of the door, including a coolie in his fifties who had been burned with the child. This coolie was so difficult to even stand because of excessive bleeding. Treatment was carried out on the road. After washing the wound infiltrated with sand and soil, I saw that the tendons and muscles were broken, but the bones were not broken. He was really dirty to the point of no return. His hair was disheveled, his face was covered with dirt, and even his ears and nostrils were filled with dust. His clothes were indistinguishable from the mud. It is said that this person lived very close to the child.</p>
<p>The next day, they came to my house together like father and son. These two people only said they came to see a doctor for one day, but they came to see me for ten days. One night, enemy planes came to bomb again, so that the entire Reconstruction Department was burned down, but fortunately there were few injured. But the next morning, these two father and son people were finally gone. About a week later, only that coolie came to the clinic. He was still that dirty appearance, but there was more pus and blood seeping out of that bandage. I asked about the child, only to find out that he was taken to the countryside by an adult. I felt a slight sense of longing, so I had to treat this coolie alone, but it was not easy to get better.</p>
<p>One day, we received an order from the military authorities to go to the countryside of Xiangyin and Changsha counties to carry out medical and pacification work, but there were already many patients, and there was really no way to stop the clinic. So, we put up a bulletin saying that we were going elsewhere. The next day, I made the last treatment, and gave each patient medicines for a considerable period of time, telling them to be careful to change the medicine, but most of them said Hua "no way", among them that coolie, after receiving the medicine and bandages, broke down in tears when he parted ways with me. My heart also felt a sour.</p>
<p>Red Cross Flag Advance</p>
<p>Military police, fully armed with grenades and pistols, and wearing Japanese shoes and civilian clothes, followed the guides and translators, all the way forward. Next was Nurse Matsuda, like a child soldier, and the Chinese nurse, Miss Zhao, wearing Chinese clothes on the upper body and Japanese soldier clothes on the lower body. Behind them were the technical assistant Yoshida, carrying a white material box, and Sergeant Tanoue, holding a large Red Cross flag, duty soldiers, security team members, and two coolies carrying luggage. At the end was me, carrying a small medical kit and an emergency kit. This was the ordinary formation of our medical pacification team going to the battlefield service. The soldiers of the security team protected us, they always covered the flag and silenced the drums, camouflaging all equipment.</p>
<p>Three days after leaving the Changsha Reconstruction Department on the morning of August 24, we toured several places in the suburbs of Changsha with the Chinese film street performance team, and stayed in several places. On September 3, we returned to the annoying Xinshi. After staying in Xinshi for nine days, thanks to the hard work of the local security team, the citizens finally slowly returned, so we took this group of returning citizens as our work object, using medical treatment and movies as a tool to pacify them. Later, personnel from the railway construction unit came to repair all the places where the Yuehan Road was damaged.</p>
<p>We followed the Kataoka team and moved from a certain place near Xinshi to the Dachu River in a village near the Yuehan Road Bridge. Our column crossed through the ripe rice fields, wading through mountains and rivers, and moving forward. Today's class flag was held at the front by the military police translation. The slopes of the automobile highway were reflected in the distant glow, and the river flowed murmuringly in the red earthen embankment. The refreshing breeze of early autumn was indeed the best day for marching. Before departure, I had paid special attention to the enemy bandits and landmines under the mountain on the right, but the beauty of the great rivers and mountains made me have to look around. There were traces of farming in the scattered houses and fields, but there were no residents. Why are there no Chinese residents in the places we go to? This is a common phenomenon in places that have not been pacified, which is not surprising. At the same time, due to their clever observation and communication, as soon as they saw the traces of us Japanese, they all disappeared. Sometimes, you can only see an old woman coming to care for the family, and children who are curious and steal a peek through the window, other than that, you can't see any Chinese people.</p>
<p>Finally, we arrived at the village we wanted to go to. Because it was surrounded by trees, you can only see the forest from a distance and not the village. But unexpectedly, there are many people, and in front of the club hall, there are tables and chairs arranged, with forty or fifty people drinking tea and wiping their hot towels, it seems to welcome distinguished guests. When they saw me wearing a Red Cross armband, everyone was surprised. In unison they said, Military medical officer! Military medical officer! Because I asked them to see me as an ordinary doctor, I took off my iron helmet to reveal my messy hair. They invited us to drink, finally we got along well, and then we started to treat their illnesses.</p>
<p>Because it was already arranged for Miss Zhao to be a translator and help, and Matsuda to do the coating and washing work, there were especially many seriously ill people, and only seventy people could be treated within the scheduled two hours. There were especially many people with 痧 eye, and our makeshift street clinics like this could not save these people's eye diseases. Later, we found that there were especially many children, which made us even more sad.</p>
<p>The residents of the area seemed to have never seen a doctor at all. When they saw the stethoscope, they were all uneasy, and had to touch it with their hands to see what it was. The carbuncles that grew on the heads and buttocks of children were put into an extra-large syringe to drain the pus, so the Chinese masses all thought we were miracle doctors. When we saw the surprised and happy expressions on the faces of the mothers of the sick children, we felt a little comfort in our hearts.</p>
<p>The morning in the village was brightened by the crowing of roosters and the Japanese army's reciting of the Imperial Edict. I was surrounded by a group of children who had been treated yesterday while washing my face by the river. They all seemed to be saying that this doctor is really great. The farmers who had already started working seemed to be asking "Are you full, sir?" when they said good morning. A Japanese plane was flying in the sky, reflecting the sun symbol. This is truly a peaceful village scene where people live and work in peace.

<p>The Situation Map of the Greater East Asia War Zone</p>
<p>There are four focal points of the Greater East Asia War, namely (1) the Southwestern Pacific front, (2) the Philippine front, (3) the Southwestern mainland front, and (4) the India-Burma front. Looking at these focal points as a whole, the regions have inherent differences, and the war situations are also different, but their consistent feature is that these four fronts are all battlefields where Japan and the United States are fighting to the death with all their strength. The enemy American's general counter-offensive of materiel began with the Guadalcanal operation in July 1942. Since then, the battlefield has moved north to the Solomon Islands, and then divided into two. One passed through the Gilbert, Marshall, and Mariana Islands, and in mid-September 1944, moved towards the western Caroline waters of Peleliu and Angaur. The other advanced west along the northern coast of New Guinea, passing through Biak and Noemfoor, and in mid-September of the same year, it also moved to the Moluccas centered on Morotai. By October of the same year, the leading edge of the enemy American pincer attack met and began a true invasion. Therefore, naval and air battles off the coast of Taiwan and the eastern coast of the Philippines were launched one after another. Although its strength suffered great losses, it still relied on its material resources to land on Leyte Island in the central Philippines, and then landed on Mindoro Island. As a result, the Japanese and American armies staged an unprecedented bloody battle. They then moved north and landed along the coast of Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island, driving south towards Manila. The Japanese army in that area had long been confident and waited in ease, adopting an elastic strategy, not caring about the gains and losses of the city, and focusing on attacking the American army under MacArthur, causing them to bleed heavily. Therefore, the fall of Manila or not has little impact on the future of the Philippine battlefield, and even if MacArthur wins the city, he will not be able to immediately determine his victory in the Philippines. Tens of thousands of Japanese troops under the command of General Yamashita are still safe and sound, and the important areas on Luzon Island are also in the hands of the Japanese army. In short, the Philippine war will inevitably become more intense in the future. (The picture and text are based on Asahi Pictorial No. 155)</p>

<h3 id="e33">After Graduation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>The clouds of October are like sheep, the winds of October are like the ebb and flow of the sea, and the sunlight of October is like the candle flame in a temple.</p>
<p>The oleander tree in front of the courtyard has shed its last petal, its branches and leaves sparse, appearing much thinner; the small loquat tree nestled in the corner, its slender trunk barely a handful, is covered in a layer of dark dust even on its palm-sized leaves, and not a single green sprout can be found.</p>
<p>Only the begonia is blooming bright red, its blossoms floating with a charming smile.</p>
<p>The earth begins to enter its aging years.</p>
<p>School has also begun. Students are once again streaming in and out of the buildings; professors, clutching thick leather briefcases, step onto the podiums, writing down the teaching materials they have repeated for years; the corridors are filled with the clamor of voices; the chemical laboratory overflows with the odor of carbon disulfide; the motors in the electrical engineering lab grind; several theodolites are set up on campus, and the red cloth on the Flag Pole flutters in the wind, as civil engineering students practice surveying.... Everything, everything is no different from the scenes of the past three years. After a two-month break, I am now reliving the old dream of school. Faced with these familiar sounds and shadows, I can't help but ask, "How have you been?"</p>
<p>But I have finally found some differences. I no longer see that familiar group of faces. They have graduated and left this school forever, replaced by a large group of unfamiliar new students. In the past, my heart would have been filled with joy, because in our life's journey, we had unconsciously gained another group of brothers and sisters, moving together towards the same goal, even though I didn't know them.</p>
<p>However, this year there is something different. Swirls have risen in the lake of my heart, and I feel unable to calm down.</p>
<p>A friend asked me, "Are you a Senior this year?"</p>
<p>"Mmm," I replied.</p>
<p>"Great, you'll graduate next year. It's so fast, so fast, haha!" He laughed, patting my arm.</p>
<p>I looked at him, speechless, only smiling at this friend.</p>
<p>I received a letter from afar, which read:</p>
<p>"Congratulations on wearing the square hat next year."</p>
<p>After reading it, I also smiled at the letter.</p>
<p>At noon, I met Miss W in a Cantonese restaurant often frequented by university students. In the course of our conversation, the issue of my graduating next year came up again. Then Miss W thought of a question:</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do after you graduate next year?"</p>
<p>This question was like a sledgehammer, hitting my chest, causing a moment of compression. Really, "What am I planning to do after graduation?"—I asked myself.</p>
<p>To Miss W's question, I could only respond with a "smile."</p>
<p>Besides answering with a "smile," what else could I say?</p>
<p>I didn't expect that as soon as I reached the fourth year, people would start asking me these questions. I never imagined that I would be as silent as a cicada in winter, unable to say a single answer, even though there was still a long year before graduation. But I have gradually begun to feel troubled.</p>
<p>Mr. C, who studied engineering, graduated almost a year ago, but for the past year he has not been drafting in a design studio, nor supervising construction at a construction site. Instead, he is working as an accountant in a bank; another Mr. H, who studied architectural engineering, became a Japanese translator after graduation, thanks to his talent for languages, even though there was no Japanese course in his school. Mr. W, Mr. T, and Mr. L jointly invested in a stock company after graduation, embarking on their great commercial ambitions. They must regret not studying commerce in school and choosing civil engineering instead. Mr. S, Mr. M, and Mr. F have all become teachers in primary and secondary schools. According to them, although it is "using great talent for small tasks," in this day and age, everything is inevitably "making a big deal out of small things," and they are content with their lot. Mr. Wang is still temporarily working as a ticket seller at a handball court after graduation. Recently, he has been worried about not finding a formal job. If he still can't find a suitable job in another six months, the knowledge of electrical engineering he gained in those four years will inevitably be thrown to the winds! Another friend told me that, as of now, only one-fifth of his graduating class this year has found formal employment, and only five or six of them have found jobs in their so-called "field."</p>
<p>"Graduation means unemployment" and "What you learn is not what you use" are two phrases that I often hear from friends who have graduated. I didn't expect that these two "old tunes" still have their power today, but what is the ultimate force that drives this power?</p>
<p>—Is it the flaws of society? Or the failure of education?</p>
<p>On the tram, I met Miss Y and another Mr. F, whom I hadn't seen for more than a year. Miss Y, being unreserved, told me that she was going to marry Mr. F in another six months. I suddenly asked her:</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to graduate in another six months?"</p>
<p>"! That's right."</p>
<p>"That's really great, graduation—marriage, it's really a double happiness!" I congratulated her sincerely, and Miss Y blushed and smiled.</p>
<p>After getting off the tram and just stepping into the school gate, I suddenly slapped my thigh and thought of a truth:</p>
<p>"A great way out after graduation—marriage!" But after thinking about it again, I felt my interest greatly diminished, because:</p>
<p>It's a pity that "taking a son-in-law" is no longer in vogue!</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's way of dealing with life was that he thought a person should first jump to the end of life, and then leisurely turn back to carefully savor life. But now I know it too late. If I could have tasted the troubles I have now earlier, and then go back to savor the joy of my freshman year, it would definitely be better.</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do after graduation?" The question is still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>My mind is as gloomy as the weather outside.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Chapter of Silence <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ni</p>
<p>I love silence, and, I remember, this quirk doesn't belong to me. We would often sit facing each other without a word. But loneliness also has its limits. Even though we love silence, sometimes a sound will break this moment of tranquility. And, the one who always lets a rough, abrupt sound intrude into the calm and peaceful air is you.</p>
<p>You just have such a strange temperament. When I rest my hand on my cheek in deep thought, you will look at me with an envious gaze. You may envy me for having such happiness, because I actually have the ability to abandon troubles; so you follow suit, resting your little hand on your cheek. In this way, we both fall into a lovely silence. However, before long, this silence ceases to be lovely to you. After all, you have the restlessness of a child. No matter how gentle you are, you throw a tantrum. After that strange silence, you will use your own voice to break the quiet world that you have created.</p>
<p>"It's too lonely," you shout like that.</p>
<p>I know you won't linger in silence for long. This cry is just as I expected. But I didn't pay attention to you. If I have a sense of pride in my ability to be silent, I was just thinking about how to train you. Ignoring you is a sign of my silence. Moreover, I am reluctant to leave my moment of quiet. I am immersed in memories, and the vanished kingdom is the world in my reverie. You are no longer in my thoughts, even if you are, it is unrealistic. A person should be happy if they have a moment of fantastic experience.</p>
<p>"What, are you dozing off?" How piercing this sound is in the silence. I was awakened by it, and opened my eyes, feeling lost and disoriented. I looked up at the surrounding furnishings, and there was you beside me; I seemed to have had a dreamy dream.</p>
<p>Your face still shows a question mark. Therefore, I gave you a bitter smile. You don't understand, I thought to myself. At this point, I couldn't maintain my ability to be silent, so I answered you:</p>
<p>"No, I closed my eyes, trying to find the traces of my thoughts."</p>
<p>These words, to you, must have another mysterious meaning. You opened your eyes wide, clearly unconvinced, and then you looked at me again with an envious expression, wanting to understand the deeper meaning of my words.</p>
<p>I seek the traces of thoughts, and you seek me in a daze.</p>
<p>So, I lowered my head again to rest my chin, signaling to you that I needed to go to the daze to find the threads of thought. If we are occupied by silence, we should be happy, at least I am.</p>
<p>I no longer bothered with your concern, and stepped into the kingdom of fantasy. I finally entered the place that I had longed for for so long and was being thought of. I seemed to see the ten thousand rays of light from that strange land, shooting into my eyes and dazzling me. Even though the traces of thoughts were chaotic, my illusions had a target. I vaguely heard your voice beside me, it was a factor of remembrance, even if I entered a hazy illusion, I remembered that there was you.</p>
<p>So I never got lost in the daze. In this strange land, I was panicked and at a loss, but there was you, there was your voice, and I calmed myself down. In this way, I discovered the value of sound. Sometimes, we are in such a lonely world! I want to commend you.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Further Commentary on the Sino-Northern China Joint Friendship Match: My Views on the Refereeing of the China-Shantou Game <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Bixian</p>
<p>The last match of the first round of the third basketball league, Group A, between Zhongbei and Hualian, was no less than a North-South battle, and could also be a resolution to the unresolved championship issue of the Shanghai News Cup. It was truly one of the most attractive games. Therefore, the game time was set at 8:00 PM, but fans had already arrived in droves before 6:00 PM, so that the basketball court was packed beyond capacity, exceeding the estimated number by several times. The boundary line circle took up a lot of space, which hindered the formal competition. However, under the circumstances at the time, stopping the game would easily cause trouble. Therefore, the authorities and both sides agreed to change it to a friendly match, so that the fans who had traveled a long way would not have made the trip in vain. However, the performance in the small basketball court could not be fully developed. It may be helpful to briefly review it, but how long this league will be delayed and how the authorities plan to maintain it properly is of great concern to fans.</p>
<p>Zhao Yalin's Outstanding Performance</p>
<p>As a result of this game, Zhongbei still maintained its victory. The main reason why Zhongbei was able to win was that each player had a lot of strength, which allowed them to develop. The team's formation was arranged in an unpredictable manner, which was the result of careful study by Team Leader Wang and Director Dai to control the opposing team. The reuse of Zhao Yalin in this battle was definitely a necessary adjustment. On the one hand, it utilized Zhao's height and on the other hand, Zhao's recent condition was extremely good. His shooting skills have also recovered to the vigor of his heyday in Beiping. His one-handed backhand shot had a unique touch, and his hard-working and aggressive spirit would be criticized by those outside, but in fact, Yalin was a pure Northern-style "decisive son." Moreover, Yalin always apologized after accidentally bumping into people, and his temper was excellent. Chen Xuezong also had satisfactory results. Zhen Zhong was always flawless in every game, worthy of being a national player. Bao Songtu, who made his debut in Zhongbei for the first time in this session, was not as dominant as he was in the Huaying team, because the expectations of other players were higher than Bao's. As a result, the Zhongbei team's man-to-man defense, the position of their players, and the mutual switching of guards were all very skilled. Under the planning of Wang and Dai, and based on the current situation, if they continue to develop normally, their technical contributions will definitely allow fans to enjoy more!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiyan Attempts New Formations</p>
<p>In this battle, Hualian's team leader Zhang Xiyan put in a lot of effort to try out new formations to face the powerful enemy. Failure is another matter. But the line of trial, is not thought of by the average person, and has a significant success. For example, Jiusheng's front line and Qinggong's defense were the most recent to be seen. Hualian certainly did not make its best efforts in this battle. Moreover, with Wu Chengzhang's casualness and Xuezong's outstanding performance, this was also an auxiliary experience. Since this battle was a friendly match, Hualian regarded it as a touchstone, and it was okay to lose and practice. In the future official league, perhaps they can learn from this battle and figure out how to respond.</p>
<p>In summary, in the battle between Zhongbei and Hualian, the game was changed from a league match to a friendly match, and the gains and losses were of no great importance. We will see you again in the future, show us up and down, Zhongbei must also be careful to prevent.</p>
<p>The Refereeing of the Hualian vs. Shantou Game Was Full of Errors</p>
<p>The second round of the Hualian and Shantou game on Tuesday of this week was still very popular among fans. Therefore, even though it was during the New Year holiday, the lively scene was as expected.</p>
<p>This time, both sides used a tight pressing man-to-man system, and every time the other side got the ball, they would chase and force them to let go. And they would never easily give the other side a chance to go up to the basket. Therefore, the scores were very low. The first half was nine to four, and the overall result was twenty to eleven, with Hualian taking the lead in both. Such a close score is the most standard score in basketball games. Unfortunately, the audience was dissatisfied with the referee's many mistakes, and there was a lot of noise, which led to slight misconduct among the players, but fortunately it was quickly quelled. According to the referee Yang Liecheng and Jin Botao. In terms of the abilities of the two, Jin is actually better than Yang. However, Mr. Yang has always had a temper of being good at his job. In such a tense game, he did not know how to retreat slightly, so once there was a mistake, it caused the audience to scream, and the more chaotic it became, the more chaotic it became. Mr. Yang should know the reason for this, and Jin Botao, who was in an auxiliary position, was mostly sitting and watching, reversing his usual ability, and should also be held responsible for not fulfilling his duties. The author, I must be at every game, I always sympathize with the referee's difficulties, and I have also written "Basketball Refereeing is Difficult" twice in this magazine, but this time, because the facts are clear, I have to add my personal opinions, and I hope that the referee association will correct it.</p>
<p>Tonight's Central Shantou Game Will Definitely See Each Side Fighting With New Methods</p>
<p>The second round of Group A will see Zhongbei and Shantou meet again. According to the Shanghai News Cup, the Shantou team had defeated Zhongbei. In the first round of the third league, Zhongbei took revenge. Tonight's (18th) meeting is the third battle. It can also be called the final battle of the two teams' best-of-three series. It is expected that both sides will fight with wits and strength, a big melee. At present, both teams have adopted a man-to-man guard, so we will see a one-on-one desperate shot. Zhongbei's ability to have the best lineup in the face of the battle is the most admirable, and Shantou should plan for the round lineup. The most important thing is not to deal with it with a fixed lineup, but to control it according to the number of people on the other side, so that there will be an unexpected performance. Considering the recent situation, Zhongbei has maintained its undefeated record in the league, while Shantou has suffered two defeats to Hualian, and its morale is not as good as Zhongbei. Therefore, in theory, Zhongbei should be able to win. In short, this battle is also a wonderful curtain.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Miscellaneous Thoughts on the Sino-Portuguese Cup Second Game <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>After the restoration of the Sino-Portuguese Cup this year, it has attracted much attention from all walks of life, because both teams' skills are famous players in Shanghai. There will definitely be a peak performance to satisfy the fans. The competition is still a best-of-three series. The first battle was held at Yiyuan on January 1st. The Portuguese team sent out all its elite, while the Chinese team was not in order. As a result, they lost to Portugal by a score of two to four.</p>
<p>The Lineups of Both Teams are Declining, and the Performance Cannot Be Wonderful</p>
<p>The second battle was held at the racecourse stadium on the afternoon of the second day of the Lunar New Year (February 13th) on Tuesday of this week. In advance, we must have thought that the Portuguese team would continue to work hard to complete its hegemony, and the Chinese team would also use its most ideal lineup to win victory and have superb skills. Unexpectedly, among the members of our Chinese team, the players selected by the Donghua team were unable to participate in the competition due to various reasons, and everyone felt worried for the Chinese team. Unexpectedly, when the Portuguese team faced the battle, six generals, including Pan Limi, Victor, Kao Sitan, Bao Xiu Tuo, W. Pan Tuo Xun, and Fu En, were absent. A few people were drawn from the reserve army and the B team to form a team. Therefore, although the Chinese team was not ideal, it still defeated Portugal with a huge score of five to zero, winning the victory and not disappointing the public. However, due to the declining lineups of both sides, there was naturally very little excitement.</p>
<p>Based on the lineup and strength of this day, it is not too much for the Chinese team to win five goals. After all, the Portuguese team is a motley crew. On the front line, except for V. Su Ruo, the center guard line only has one Oliveira, and the back guard only has one Ke Lai Tuo. How can they rely on this triangle line to score goals and attack? A mess of sand. The Chinese team is based on the Friendship team, supplemented by Hua Tong Meng Yiliang, Shanghai Police Yu's brothers, etc. In terms of cooperation, there is very little impact. They won five cities in a row, and there was absolutely no fluke.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Team's Sloppy Response is Unfathomable</p>
<p>However, after watching this game, the author has some feelings. The situation of the past Sino-Portuguese Cup was always like a raging fire, and the two teams attached great importance to the cup competition, selected team members, stepped up training, and spent a lot of effort. In the end, they had good results. Therefore, regardless of the winner or loser, their serious engagement attracted fans and created a record worth recording in the history of the game. The fact that this second battle created such a scattered phenomenon is really incomprehensible. Moreover, Portugal's response to this historic battle, at this critical moment, with seven or zero people falling behind, is it intentionally giving way? Or does it have other effects? Or is it waiting until the final game to show its power again? This is difficult to know unless the team authorities know the mystery of the matter. In short, it is a fact that it is completely different from the past serious approach, which was necessary to win the silver cup. Finally, the author can only hope that in the third battle, both sides can have the determination to win, and send all their forces to ensure that this year's Sino-Portuguese Cup has the most hopeful harvest, and it will not live up to the efforts of the Football Association to restore this cup competition.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Today's Football League: Friendship vs. Police Fierce Battle <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Today (18th) in the morning, there will be a wonderful scene in the Group A league at Yiguan, which is the friendship battle against the Shanghai Police. The former has only one draw in the league, and the rest have been victories. It occupies the first place in the police force and has a strong hope of winning the championship. Since the Friendship team set out this season, its momentum has been very strong, and its record is also remarkable. However, it drew with De Shang in the league, and also suffered from De Shang's poisonous hands in the Mayor's Cup. Is De Shang the nemesis of the team? Fortunately, the Friendship team still has hope in the league. Since there is no path to Jin in the Mayor's Cup, it should devote all its efforts to this. It should be determined to face the enemy this morning. The people of the Shanghai Police Force are indeed very impressive. However, this year, they have not been able to get their loyalty, until the recent Mayor's Cup, when they defeated the Portuguese merchants, who were clamoring at the time, by two to one, and displayed the skills that they should have. And the most terrible thing about them is their sharp offensive. One of the small yellow hairs窜，麥其當之脚頭，Friendship should seek victory, must find a way to stop these two people, and the most important point of their own, must use the most popular center guard line. Song Xisheng, Qu Yongfu, and Zheng Yingquan must all attend. Only in this way can they respond to each other, so with the ability of the five forwards, once they get the help of the center guard line, they will definitely be able to break the enemy. Moreover, they must avoid being too emotional and should be calm. They must know that the more angry they are, the easier it is to lose their composure. They should always maintain the spirit of the upper court, then their harvest, no matter what, will definitely give a good impression to the fans. I hope all the athletes will keep this in mind.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Essentials of Basketball Theory (10) (1) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>(3) In a certain strategy, it serves as a means of deploying the formation and adapting to the situation.</p>
<p>(4) To maintain the opportunity to get the ball and prevent the opponent from taking it away.</p>
<p>(5) Used to escape the opponent's snatching.</p>
<p>(6) Used to deceive the opponent. Shift the situation and disperse the opponent.</p>
<p>(7) When there is no one defending, to dribble the ball closer to the basket for easy shooting.</p>
<p>(3) Three Keys to Dribbling</p>
<p>(1) The pace should be changed frequently. Do not use one kind of pace and a certain speed to advance. Use various fast and slow paces that are uncertain, so that people cannot grasp the dribbling and pace to adapt to the situation and environment. (2) Dribble the ball with one hand that is farther away from the enemy: For example, when the enemy is tracking and stealing the ball on the right side, then the left hand should be used to dribble the ball. If the enemy is stealing the ball on the left side, then the right hand should be used. (3) Make a sharp turn. For example, if you encounter an enemy in front, first pretend to go to the left to dribble the ball, so that the enemy's body tends to the left and loses its center of gravity, then quickly turn to the right to dribble and rush past him.</p>
<p>(4) Common Sense of Dribbling</p>
<p>(1) In the front court (i.e. your own basket area), do not always dribble the ball forward (unless the front court is empty).</p>
<p>(2) Do not look down when dribbling and do not pay attention to the front court.</p>
<p>(3) Do not develop a habit of督　, when you can pass the ball, but use the dribble to keep it in mind, passing the ball is faster than dribbling.</p>
<p>(4) Do not stand and switch the ball with both hands, or act like a neurotic, doing unconscious ball play, which hinders the offensive opportunity. Many times, you become a jumper because of this.</p>
<p>(5) The height and speed of the dribble should be matched with the overall structure of your body. Strive to achieve the greatest possible continuousness, while still being able to keep the ball under full control.</p>
<p>(6) The most proper way to dribble past the enemy is to dribble straight towards the enemy, and when you are two or three yards away from the enemy, quickly turn to the left or right to dribble past him.</p>

<p>Bao Songtu has been appointed as the assistant manager of the Dadong Restaurant.</p>
<p>Famous volleyball player Tan Yongzhan has left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Famous basketball player Fu Xilong is serving as a training instructor for the Baojia Corps in his spare time.</p>
<p>Zhu Shifang has recently been focusing on practicing badminton. It is reported that he practices tirelessly every day in the open space next to his residence.</p>
<p>Since Xuan Tong of the Xuan family team got engaged, he has rarely been seen on the court, and there is a hint of forgetting about playing. (Quiet)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Letter from Jia Youliang: A Statement for Tung Wah and Himself <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jia Youliang's letter states that the restoration of the Sino-Portuguese Cup has allowed this historical competition to continue, which is a great thing for the football world. In this year's first match, our Chinese team was unfortunately defeated. For the second match, all the players of our Tung Wah team were unable to participate due to work commitments, which attracted much attention from all walks of life before the match. In fact, most of our colleagues are engaged in the silver and money industry, and their working hours on the 12th are very late. The match was on the 13th. If they were forced to play, they would not have good results. Therefore, it would be better to retire. This is the only reason for the Tung Wah team's withdrawal from the Chinese team. Fortunately, the second match has already been held, and the Portuguese team has been overcome through careful selection and adjustment by the authorities. It can be said that our team's withdrawal has at least yielded this gain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have been "temporarily suspended from representing the Chinese team" by the Football Association due to the conflict with Victor. As for the penalty imposed by the authorities, athletes are always happy to accept it. However, I have not yet seen the so-called temporary suspension announcement from the Football Association, which may cause some misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, I make the above statement.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Pictorial</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese Navy and Air Force unite and advance aggressively</p>
<p>(2) The activity of Japanese army's anti-aircraft machine gun teams</p>
<p>(3) The market entrance is crowded with people seeking relief for students who have dropped out of school - part of the charity market</p>
<p>(4) The Allies are actively engaged in construction as the mainland railway is opened</p>
<p>(5) The air defense and relief teams hold water delivery training</p>
