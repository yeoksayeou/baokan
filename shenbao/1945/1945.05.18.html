<h3>冲繩嘉手納附近海面　日空軍猛攻敵艦　登陸敵熾搨害達四萬餘名</h3>
<p>南西羣島基地十七日中央社電　日航空部隊，現仍對冲繩附近敵艦船集團及機塲繼續加以攻擊，十六日拂曉於嘉手納海而附近，擊沉大型艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘發生大火，大致已告沉沒。敵方中北兩機塲，亦於十六日未明爲日空軍襲擊，十三處起火，二處爆炸，一處大火，並望見在嘉手納海面有驅逐艦等數艘起火，漂流不定。十六日傍晚在久米島附近國剿敵艦船，擊沉運輪船一艘，又十六日來襲列島綫各地之敵機約有二百架。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地十七日中央社電　冲繩本島之日守備隊，迎日與優勢敵軍激戰，使敵流血甚大，平均每日斃敵二千一百餘名，自八日至十三日之六日間，日軍於陸上曾斃敵一萬二千六百名，擊落飛機六架，擊傷二架，破損戰車九十三輛，炸燬汽車，裝甲車五十七輛，破壞大砲十一門，破壞迫擊砲三十八門，燃料彈藥倉庫八處，此外，並破壞輕重機槍，步槍甚多，此等赫赫戰果，與自四月一日敵於本島登陸以來之損害相合，其數已達四萬七千三百名，此數幾爲敵登陸軍二分之一。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　冲繩本島之地上戰鬥，十五日愈加熾烈，據關島來電稱，因美軍犧牲重大，故其攻勢亦轉遲緩，據冲繩前綫路透社電稱，日軍對美海軍隊實行猛烈砲火後，轉取攻勢，美軍發動　夫等所有人員參加作戰，而前進僅二百米。然此戰鬥美軍之死傷甚衆，其戰鬥中之某中隊二百四十人中，得生還者僅二名，此次戰鬥為冲繩最大之激戰，那覇前面之部隊，亦因日軍猛烈砲攻，致增援補給皆告絕望。</p>
<h3>那覇與首里間　展開殊死戰　日以繼夜爭寸土尺地</h3>
<p>中央社訊　冲繩本島南部地區，美軍於九日發動所謂第三次總攻擊以來，兩軍日以繼夜，爲爭奪寸土尺地而展開血戰，尤於十三日後，美軍攻勢集中於經塚，澤軧兩地及那覇北方天久地區，向那覇與首里問之山獄地帶日軍主要陣地綫加重壓力。此高地帶為冲繩本島之戰略要塞，該要塞之爭奪戰，足使冲繩全島戰局引起重大變化。因此日美兩軍展開殊死攻防戰。美軍火砲及兵力，數量上頗佔優勢，從艦上發射砲彈，幾可掩沒津波，日軍則誘敵軍深入，再加殲滅，戰事慘烈不可言狀。英美從軍記者亦曾有詳細報告。十七日紐約時報特派員洛萊斯消息稱：美軍現奮戰不已，以謀奪取艦砲轟擊目標之高地，然美軍兵士一獲少許進展，即受猛烈砲火襲擊，即以第七十七聯隊　，日軍在四分鐘間對其發射道擊砲彈百發，某坦克車中隊爲應援七十七聯隊，出動坦克車二十一輛及火燄噴射器向高地洞窟攻擊，惟經攻擊後，美軍所新坦克軍僅有七輛。又步兵挺進之前，必須由坦克車放射汽油將丘陵燒盡，但衝抵高地後，洞窟中日軍機槍彈又如兩點飛來。又十七日路透社特派員報告稱：美車在南冲繩地區，已遭遇日軍猛烈反攻，美軍中担任燒麵包等工作之伙夫，亦出發前綫，阻遇日軍反攻。經此役後，美軍不得不從那覇地區戰綫後退二百碼。</p>
<p>美軍當局雖以多報少，但觀察彼等發表之戰况，亦可以想像血流成渠之景慘。過去一個半月間，美第二十四集團軍之第九十六師團及第二十七師團已滿身創痍，潰不成軍矣。海上兵員損失亦極慘重，此於今後作戰上，將受重大影響，固　極明顯之事實。</p>
<h3>對防共協定　滿宣告失效</h3>
<p>新京十七日中央社電　滿洲國政府於康德六年二月二十四日參加之防共協定，由於歐洲情形轉變，現已失效，關於此事，滿外交部特於十七日發表談話如次：因國際情形轉變，滿洲帝國政府認爲，防共協定已失其效。</p>
<h3>武部飛東京</h3>
<p>新京十七日中央社電　武部總務長官偕同古海總務應次長，十七日空路赴東京。</p>
<h3>日艦在麻六甲　擊沉英巡艦　泰拉干撈印日軍奮戰</h3>
<p>印度洋前綫基地十七日中央社電　日海上艦艇，十六日黎明於麻六甲海峽，發見由巡洋艦二艘，驅逐三艘而成之英艦羣，與之交戰，轟沉其巡洋艦一艘。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　墨爾缽來電稱，澳洲軍司令部發表：日軍於泰拉干島勇戰之情形如下，澳軍於泰拉干島波柴希安油田東方，與日軍激鬥，五日，日軍依據　壕堅强抵抗，澳軍雖有艦砲，飛機及大砲之猛攻，然登陸軍仍受極大捐害，而日軍復於夜間反覆來襲。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地十七日中央社電　敵軍於十四日　同，對撈印高地加以熾烈砲擊轟炸後，以戰車光　强行突破日軍陣地，日守備部隊當即邀擊，現正與之激戰中。迄十四日於陸上斃敵二千五百名，擱置破展戰車裝甲車以及其他車輛八十七輛，擊落敵機十餘架，並於海上轟沉擊沉輸送四艘。</p>
<h3>美記者論　日特攻戰術</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　美國泰晤士週刋四月三十日刋載該雜誌記者謝羅得手記，發表日本特攻隊攻擊之猛烈情形，該文稱，美軍於冲繩島作戰，初次出動太平洋海軍部隊，參加登陸作載、其死傷較陸上部隊尤衆，此係日軍特攻隊反覆猛攻冲繩海面艦船所致。日軍主要攻擊法，乃對美艦船敢行衝撞，亦即所謂特攻隊肉搏戰術，日本此種惟一戰術「特攻法」，自吾等美國人觀之。或可認爲「死之比賽」，然此確係日軍之特殊戰術，且日軍對此項「攻擊」抱絕大希望。日軍於冲繩作戰，動員全部飛機及駕駛員，傾注全力對美攻擊，決非過甚其辭，據專門家觀察，日軍速度最低之轟炸機亦行出動，計共有十五種飛機，於空中飛行，余於去年冬季初次領略「日軍特攻」之成力，該時日軍對余當時所乘之軍艦前道，日特攻機掠過我方戰鬥機之間隙後，向我方接近，其中一架對余所秉之軍艦實行肉彈突擊，當時黑烟冲天，高達三百公尺，同時發生大爆炸。經此攻擊後，未及一小時，日機復行來襲，我方富即對該機集中砲火，該機當即起火，然該機仍不顧一切，向前猛衝，未幾美艦一艘已且起火柱，受創甚重。</p>
<h3>塔那擢昇上將</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日央中社電　據華盛頓來電，現在冲繩島之美太平洋方面水陸兩用部隊司令官塔那海軍中將，業經特魯曼總統耀昇爲海軍上將。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>做大官與做大事</h3>
<p>中山先生說過：「我們要立志做大事，不　做大官」，這話雖遠在民國十二年十二月二十一日對嶺南學生說的，但是在此時此地，對於政界人士，還是非常適用的。記得當時全國軍閥政客互相勾結，國家政治腐敗黑暗，對外則茍安屈膝，對內則寸土必爭，自相殘殺，百事廢弛，民生憔悴。中山先生痛心　首之餘，乃發為此「要做大事不可做大官」的話，以勤勉靑年學生。當時他不僅對靑年學生這樣　　勸勉，並對國民黨黨員及武裝同志，也曾不斷提出同樣的勸告，如民國十二年十月對中國國民黨懇親大會上的訓詞，也用「黨員不可存心做官」訓誡黨員，而勉勵大家決心去做救國救民的大事業。他痛心於當時一部分社會領袖及知識分子，因爲好名求官，依附於軍閥官僚門下，變成各級政客，却把國家社會急待舉辦的事某置諸腦後，士大夫們也和官僚政客們一樣泄泄沓沓，弄得國家社會一盤散沙。所以他鼓勵大家不要做大官，應該做大事業。目前我們旴衡國家社會的現狀，仍不能不追念巾山先生的話，面知所警惕。</p>
<p>本來，「三代以下，未有不好各者」，大部分人之急於做大官，推究動機，其始米必人人盡爲藉官勢以逐私利，而作爲好名之心所迷。其後踏入腐敗黑暗的官塲，便不自主的　勢逐利了，以致原有好名立功的初志，也隨之掃地以盡。其實，好名本非壞事，在得其道。誠如中山先生所說：「古今人物之名望的高大，不是在他所做的官大，是在他所做的事業成功。如果一件事業能够成功，便能够享大各。」我們在此時此地特別提此一段舊話，無非希望正在官道中的，抱具爲國爲民爲事業而做官的態度，立言立功。在求官道中的，還是切實的替社會做點有益的事業。在這時局動盪的時代，我們尤其盼望有志人士，體騐中山光生的遺訓，而決定立身立業之道。</p>
<p>至於怎樣才算做大事業呢？中山先生也說過，「只要有國民的大志氣，專心做一件事，帮助國家，變成富强」，這就是非同小可的大事業了。簡單的說，凡努力不懈，堅守本位工作者，就是個人的大事業。除了努力本位工作以外，同時對於國家社會公衆利益，努力服務，就是國家社會的大事業。例如最近國府任命　民道丁默囤兩氏分長粵浙兩省，對於地方興革，確立治安，安定民生等等，在在本諸為國爲民的志願，切實做一番事業。其次，今日上海最迫切的事業，如人口之疏散，工業之向內地轉移，交通運輸之改善，農業貸款之舉辦，救濟庫劵之購買及慈善救濟事業之推進，凡此一切，也都是此時此地社會人士應做的大事業。因此，我們特別提出中山先生的遺訓，願大家：「立志做大事，不可做大官！」</p>
<h3>日軍使敵出血　已逐漸奏效　松島部長談冲繩戰局</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，由松島報道部長闡述冲繩島最近戰况，敵人遭受空前損失登陸之兵士損近在半數以上，兵員補充極感困難，日軍已漸達到使敵出血之目標。茲誌演詞大要如次：</p>
<p>登陸敵軍死亡大半</p>
<p>最近冲繩島戰況，西部那覇，中部首里北方，東部與那原一帶，日軍與敵軍雙方展開邀戰。敵人從南方進攻，調動陸軍四師團，海軍兩師團，企圖突破戰綫，但每次均遭打擊，受到相當損害。至五月八日止根據敵方發表，兵員死二千六百四十八人，傷及失踪者一萬三千七百四十一人，合計一萬六千三百八十九人。又據敵軍第十軍軍醫畏胡世德維大佐稱；傷兵中又死亡三千九百六十七人，前後合共六千六百十五人。過去敵方發表其兵士死傷時，照例爲其實際損失之十分之一，故根據此例推測，敵方損失之兵員至少在五六萬以上，敵人在冲繩島登陸之十萬兵士，死傷已達大半，兵員補充上感受相當困難，敵人因病院船及野戰病院之不足，無法收容傷兵，是以每天用十架左右之運送機搬運傷兵。又敵方發表除上述之死傷數目外，陸軍中有二千人，海軍中四千人，患有疾病，依此而說，日軍使敵出血可說已漸漸奏效，而對其艦船之攻擊，亦繼續不斷使敵遭受空前損害。</p>
<p>敵方海軍無力增强</p>
<p>敵機動部隊十三十四兩日往襲九州，其兵力爲正式之航空母艦六幾戰艦四艘所編成之兩羣，因日軍之猛擊，敵人已受嚴重打擊。航空母艦至少擊沉兩艘，及其他艦船數艘向南方敗退。同時日軍對冲繩周圍登陸之部隊，亦繼續猛烈打擊中。十六日由陸上望見海上有大型敵艦船遭擊沉，另一艘在燃燒中，敵方已損失艦船五百艘以上，兵力缺乏，感受相當痛苦。今後縱能從歐洲務動兵力，但其海軍第一綫之兵力，終將無法增強，以部繩為中心作戰現正白熱化，今後一二週內之戰況，尤其値得特別注意。</p>
<p>敵美企圖制覇兩洋</p>
<p>敵人根據歐洲戰局結束，一再宣傳將移動大量兵力，同時宣傳航空戰之效果。當然此種說法將來並非不可能，但具體之實現，決不能若宣傳之簡單。尤其最近英美蘇三國間之政治關係，加以船舶問題，距離問題等，均爲敵方歷史上非常之大工作，不能輕易從事。據十四日華盛頓美聯社電稱：美海軍總司令全大將在上院會議席上要求今後從菲律賓羣島一直至大西洋口，美國亟應設立若干海軍根據地。金氏之要求無非表現美國欲在兩大洋上制覇之野心表現。其所唱之種種和平，為不能放棄武器之假面具的世界和平論法而已。舊金山會議，各國意見紛歧，不能一致，英美蘇之合作問題，波鬧問題，奧地利問題，阿根廷問題等等，無從協調。十四日波蘭政權自動的將波蘭人一千名送至德國之沃特河區法蘭克福，此種舉動，實為突如其來，而出人意表者也。</p>
<p>最後松島大佐稱：據十六日紐約廣播，有美軍已佔領沖繩島，渝軍佔領福州等消息，實為虛為之宣傳云。</p>
<h3>共榮圈學生　入京都帝大</h3>
<p>京都十六日中央社電　京都帝大前曾招考共榮圈各地之新留用學生四十餘各，十五日舉行人學典禮，並爲適應世界局勢，創設留學生敎育協議會，舉行座談會及各項演習，留學生已全部移居學案，中國，滿洲國留學生遷入洛東公寓，南方各地留學生遷入國際學友會。</p>
<h3>大西洋水域　日潛艇參戰</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　華盛頓來電，美大西洋艦隊司令長官英格拉姆，十六日會見記者團，發表日本潛水艇於大西洋水域與德國潛水艇協力施行共同作戰，以致引起極大衝動。據英格拉姆聲明稱，美海軍之某一艦艇，去夏曾於永島南方水域遭遇日本潛水艇，日本潛水艇參加大西洋通商破襲戰，此次尚屬初次發現。</p>
<p>東京埂七日中央社電　美國戰爭公報稱，美海軍部今日公布，美驅逐艦護送船一艘，於大西洋中遭潛水艇擊沉，該報復稱，於此一役中，美方曾損失艦船三百〇八隻。</p>
<h3>渝美機襲京</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　十七日下午一時五十五分及四時三十分，駐渝美空軍轟炸機一架，兩度侵入京郊上空，於浦口投下照明彈及炸彈，地上略有損害。</p>
<h3>襲名古屋敵機　墜毀卅一架　熱田神宮一部份起火</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營十七日十二時四十分發表：　十七日二時許起，約歷二小時，南方基地B29型機約一百架，來襲名古屋地區，對市街地區投燒夷彈，熱田神宮本殿一部房勢頂及附屬建築物起火。又名古屋市內各處發生火災，至拂曉已告熄滅。　迄現在爲止，查叫戰果，計擊落九架，擊毀二十二架。</p>
<p>名古屋十七日中央社電　馬里亞納基地B29型機百架，於十七日拂曉來襲名古屋，是日敵機於三千或五千公尺之高空，於上午二時許起至四時許，以單架或少數機，由西方來襲名古屋，投下五十公斤之大型燃燒彈，二十二公斤半之埃列特倫型燃炸彈，盲炸熱田神宮本殿及社　之一部，並襲擊南部地區，直炸中村·熱田·瑞穗·電川·昭和·中榮港·千草各區市街及一部工塲，日軍民打成一片，力作消防工作，於拂曉時將火撲滅。敵機此次取慣例之欺騙行動，警報發出時，由琵琶湖北方向西飛行，並未出現名古屋，但一小時之後，突轉航侵入名古屋，同時爲攪亂日方之電波探知器，撒下錫片，然日方制空部隊當即向其加以猛攻，地上砲火亦對空猛射，結果盤落九架，擊毀其二十二架。</p>
<p>朝鮮臺灣先後空襲</p>
<p>京城十七日中央社電　轉鮮軍管區司令部十七日下午四時發表：十七日上午十一時左右，有敵大型機四架，以二架編隊，來襲全羅北道西海面及金羅南道西部及南部各海面，均於下午一時半左右向南方逸去，日方毫無損害。</p>
<p>台北十七日中央社電　十六日白晝，敵轟炸機約七十架，戰鬥機約十架，由菲島基地起飛，來襲台中·台南·新竹各地區，並有一部侵入玉里附近，以機槍掃射港灣都市後，於下午三時許，向南方逸去。</p>
<h3>京郊除蝗　積極進行中</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　京郊除蝗工作，於各有關機關緊密協力下，積極展開捕捉工作，且十五日來，首都各農業學校學生，亦多數自動前往參加協力捕捉，據悉，目下該區所實施之捕捉方法有二，一為圍攻法，即於蝗蝻最多處，插一白旗，四週園以鄉民，手持竹帝，捕殺前進，以白旗爲中心，直至全滅而後止。一爲控溝法，於蝗蝻盛多處，四週挖溝，潺以底寬口窄爲佳，內盛以水，水面佔油，盡驅蝗蝻入淸，使之淹滅。又日前中國合作社預備白布數十疋，裁成長方形，令農民於蝗蝻較盛處，以引蝗蝻跳上布面後，再倒入蒲包內焚斃之。</p>

<h3>上川鐵路現况</h3>
<p>— 劉豐</p>
<p>市建設局上川上南兩路管理處，以行駛上川路之客車與機頭，均已修理整頓一新，特於昨日上午九時半招待主管機關官長及各報社訊者前往慶寗寺參觀新事，視察行車秩序，總站狀况，巡視機廠，後並舉行簡單之儀式。</p>
<p>參觀一行有建設局局長徐季敦，暨第一科長王濂，第三科長商政，市府秘書處第三科長梁淼章，及各報記者十餘人。主人方面有上川上南兩路管理處長趙海淸，訓處長張鵬程，暨業務股主任史又新，及程一平等。</p>
<p>修整經過</p>
<p>上川鐵路為民國十四年興築，初為商辦，四年前改歸市有，全長四十八華里，行車需一小時，是一種類似礦坑所用的　便鐵路，機車客軍均爲二十餘年前之德國出品，此項車輛已久歷風霜，並屢經破壞。現時計有修理完整如新之機車一輛，四十英尺客車三輛，二十八英尺客車一輛，二十八英尺貨車一輛，其修理費及配換零件等費僅用三百四十七萬元，該項新整機車除門窗等裝配一新外，行駛亦較迅速，且耗煤亦省。全路現每月用煤約一百八十噸，其中除八十噸爲每噸價四萬元之配給煤外，餘百噸光景均係以約二十萬元一噸之黑市價購來。另有舊機車二部，舊客貨　七部，尙待修理，唯所需零件搜購不易，購價太昂，尙須當局協助解決。其枕木業已更換一部，現一根價約二萬餘，爲減少出軌危險，亦急待更換，現正擬進行購買華鐵之舊枕木。</p>
<p>營業現况</p>
<p>行車時間現每日中午十二時及下午五時半目慶寗寺開，經金家橋，新陸，邵家衖，曹家路，大灣，小灣，暮紫橋，川沙，小營房至江鎭。自江鎭開爲晨九時及下午二時半。客票價慶寗寺至川沙爲七百九十元，全程九百四十元。貨票減半。隨票代微通行稅百分之十。優待軍警並另製發掉換券換用軍警票。車票係儘量出售，如有故意逃票者查出則按五倍處罸。在未改革前除無票乘車者頗多外，並有軍警勒令强迫停駛，隨時隨地搭乘之怪現象發生，現則準時開行，準時到達。旅客以農民為多，一部爲小商人，其所帶去者多爲肥皂，香烟，火柴等，運來者大宗爲監及農村產物。</p>
<p>職工待遇</p>
<p>兩路管理個現有職工共二百四十餘人，在趙處長初蒞任時僅有百八十人。改革後事務繁多，收入亦激增，二月份計二一四九四二三二元，三月份即爲四六六一三一四四元，四月份竟達五〇二五七二八〇元。三月份盈餘呈解入市庫的款子就有一千〇四十萬〇八千三百元。職工待遇亦有澈底改善，除本薪外，每月並按營業額提百分之十爲員工補助費，此項補助費上月約等於本　之一倍，中級職員約共得七八萬元以上，每月並有三斗免費米可拿。在從前有員工俄斃的事情發生，最近因見待遇優厚，故如機廠中離職之技術工人又紛紛歸來。由於生活的安定及督導有方，路政在緊張熱烈的淸緒丁推進着。</p>
<p>誠如趙處長所說：「兩路好似病夫一樣，做大夫是很感棘手的。「但在短短的三個月內，在全體員工，不眠不休和夜以繼日的工作下，已經大為改善。昨天徐建設局長誇獎得非常恰當，說：「在好的環境中有所成就是不足為奇的，在經費·物資·人事·政治等都很困難的條件下，在大破壞後的短時期內能有如此的成就，是非常難能而且可敬的！」</p>

<h3>Vicinity of Kadena, Okinawa: Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Ships; Over 40,000 Enemy Casualties in Landing</h3>
<p>South Seas Islands Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units are continuing their attacks on enemy ship groups and airfields near Okinawa. At dawn on the 16th, near the sea off Kadena, they sank one large warship and set one destroyer ablaze, which is presumed to have sunk. Enemy airfields in the central and northern parts of the island were also attacked by Japanese air units on the 16th before daybreak, resulting in thirteen fires, two explosions, and one large fire. It was also observed that several destroyers were on fire in the sea off Kadena, drifting aimlessly. In the evening of the 16th, enemy ships were engaged and one transport ship was sunk near Kume Island. Approximately 200 enemy aircraft have attacked various locations along the island chain since the 16th.</p>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese garrison on Okinawa Island is engaged in fierce battles against superior enemy forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On average, over 2,100 enemy troops are killed daily. In the six days from the 8th to the 13th, Japanese forces on land killed 12,600 enemy troops, shot down six aircraft, damaged two, destroyed 93 tanks, destroyed 57 automobiles and armored vehicles, destroyed 11 artillery pieces, destroyed 38 mortars, and destroyed eight fuel and ammunition depots. In addition, numerous light and heavy machine guns and rifles were destroyed. These remarkable achievements, combined with the damage inflicted since the enemy landed on the island on April 1st, amount to 47,300 casualties. This number is nearly half of the enemy's landing force.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The ground battles on Okinawa Island intensified on the 15th. According to a dispatch from Guam, the American offensive has slowed due to heavy casualties. According to a Reuters dispatch from the Okinawa front, the Japanese forces launched an offensive after inflicting heavy artillery fire on the American naval forces. The Americans mobilized all available personnel, and only advanced 200 meters. However, American casualties in this battle were very high. In one company of 240 men, only two survived. This battle was the most intense on Okinawa, and the troops in front of Naha have no hope of reinforcement or resupply due to the heavy Japanese artillery fire.</p>
<h3>Desperate Battles Unfold Between Naha and Shuri: Day and Night Struggle for Every Inch of Ground</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch – In the southern region of Okinawa Island, since the Americans launched their so-called third general offensive on the 9th, both armies have been engaged in a bloody battle day and night to seize every inch of ground. Especially after the 13th, the American offensive concentrated on the areas of Kyozuka and Sawaedi, as well as the Tenkyu area north of Naha, increasing pressure on the main Japanese defensive line in the mountainous area between Naha and Shuri. This highland area is a strategic fortress on Okinawa Island, and the battle for this fortress is causing a major change in the overall situation on Okinawa. Therefore, Japanese and American forces are engaged in a desperate offensive and defensive battle. The American artillery and troop strength are numerically superior, and the shells fired from their warships almost engulf the area. The Japanese forces lure the enemy in deep and then annihilate them, making the battle extremely brutal. British and American war correspondents have also provided detailed reports. A New York Times correspondent, Lorris, reported on the 17th: "American forces are fighting hard to seize the high ground targeted by naval bombardment, but as soon as American soldiers make any progress, they are subjected to heavy artillery fire. For example, the 77th Regiment was subjected to a hundred rounds of mortar fire from the Japanese in four minutes. A tank company, deployed to support the 77th Regiment, sent out 21 tanks and flamethrowers to attack the caves on the high ground, but after the attack, only seven of the new American tanks remained. Before the infantry can advance, the hills must be burned with gasoline from the tanks, but after reaching the high ground, machine gun fire from the Japanese in the caves rains down." A Reuters correspondent reported on the 17th: "American forces in southern Okinawa have encountered a fierce Japanese counterattack. Even the cooks who normally bake bread for the American forces have been sent to the front lines to resist the Japanese counterattack. After this battle, American forces had to retreat 200 yards from the Naha front."</p>
<p>Although the American authorities underreport casualties, one can imagine the bloody scene by observing their published battle reports. In the past month and a half, the 96th Division and 27th Division of the American 24th Army Corps have been battered and are in disarray. The loss of naval personnel is also extremely severe, which will have a significant impact on future operations. This is a very obvious fact.</p>
<h3>Manchuria Announces Anti-Comintern Pact Invalidation</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Anti-Comintern Pact, which the government of Manchukuo joined on February 24th of the sixth year of Kangde (1939), has become ineffective due to the changing situation in Europe. Regarding this matter, the Manchurian Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on the 17th: "Due to changes in the international situation, the government of the Empire of Manchuria believes that the Anti-Comintern Pact has lost its effectiveness."</p>
<h3>Takebe Flies to Tokyo</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Takebe, the Director-General of General Affairs, and Furumi, the Vice-Director of General Affairs, flew to Tokyo on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Sinks British Cruiser in the Strait of Malacca; Japanese-Indian Troops Fight Bravely on Tarakan</h3>
<p>Indian Ocean Frontline Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese naval vessels encountered a British fleet consisting of two cruisers and three destroyers in the Strait of Malacca at dawn on the 16th. In the ensuing battle, they sank one of the cruisers.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A dispatch from Melbourne states that the Australian military command has announced the following regarding the brave fighting of Japanese troops on Tarakan Island: "Australian forces are engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops east of the Poeloe Sibian oilfields on Tarakan Island. On the 5th, Japanese troops resisted fiercely from their strong trenches. Despite heavy attacks by Australian naval guns, aircraft, and artillery, the landing forces suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese troops launched repeated night attacks."</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 14th, the enemy launched intense artillery bombardments and aerial bombings against the heights of Laoag. Subsequently, they forcibly broke through the Japanese lines with tanks. The Japanese garrison immediately engaged them, and fierce fighting is currently underway. As of the 14th, 2,500 enemy troops have been killed on land, 87 tanks, armored vehicles, and other vehicles have been abandoned or destroyed, over ten enemy aircraft have been shot down, and four transport ships have been sunk or damaged at sea.</p>
<h3>American Journalist Discusses Japanese Special Attack Tactics</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The American magazine *Time* published a diary entry by its correspondent Sherwood on April 30th, describing the intensity of the Japanese special attack units. The article stated that the American forces fighting on Okinawa Island, who were deploying Pacific naval forces for the first time in the landing operations, suffered even more casualties than the ground troops. This was due to the repeated and fierce attacks by Japanese special attack units on ships off Okinawa. The main Japanese attack method is to ram American ships, which is the so-called "special attack" or "body-crashing" tactic. This unique Japanese tactic, the "special attack," may be considered a "game of death" by us Americans, but it is indeed a special Japanese tactic, and the Japanese place great hope on this "attack." The Japanese are mobilizing all aircraft and pilots in the Okinawa campaign, pouring all their efforts into attacking the Americans. This is not an exaggeration. According to experts, even the slowest Japanese bombers are being deployed, with a total of fifteen types of aircraft flying in the air. I first experienced the power of the "Japanese special attack" last winter. At that time, a Japanese special attack aircraft flew past our fighter planes and approached the warship I was on. One of them carried out a suicide attack on the warship. Black smoke billowed up 300 meters high, and there was a huge explosion. Less than an hour after this attack, Japanese aircraft attacked again. Our forces immediately concentrated fire on the aircraft, which caught fire. However, the aircraft continued to charge forward regardless, and soon an American warship was engulfed in flames and heavily damaged.</p>
<h3>Turner Promoted to Admiral</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Admiral Turner, the commander of the American Pacific amphibious forces currently on Okinawa Island, has been promoted to admiral by President Truman.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Making a Big Official vs. Making a Big Impact</h3>
<p>Sun Yat-sen once said: "We must aspire to make a big impact, not just to become a big official." Although this was said to Lingnan students as far back as December 21, 1923, it is still very applicable to political figures in this time and place. I remember that at that time, warlords and politicians across the country colluded with each other, the national politics were corrupt and dark, and in foreign affairs, they sought temporary peace by yielding and compromising, while internally, they fought for every inch of land, killing each other. Everything was neglected, and the people suffered. Sun Yat-sen was deeply grieved and made this statement, "We must make a big impact, not just become a big official," to encourage young students. At that time, he not only encouraged young students in this way, but also constantly gave the same advice to Kuomintang members and armed comrades. For example, in his address to the Kuomintang Alumni Association in October 1923, he also admonished party members with the words, "Party members must not be minded to become officials," and encouraged everyone to resolve to carry out the great cause of saving the country and the people. He was saddened that some social leaders and intellectuals at the time were seeking fame and positions, attaching themselves to warlords and bureaucrats, and becoming politicians at all levels, while neglecting the urgent tasks of the country and society. The literati and officials were just as apathetic and complacent as the bureaucrats and politicians, leaving the country and society in disarray. Therefore, he encouraged everyone not to become big officials, but to make a big impact. At present, when we assess the current situation of the country and society, we cannot help but recall Sun Yat-sen's words and be alerted.</p>
<p>Originally, "since the Three Dynasties, there have been no virtuous individuals." Most people's eagerness to become big officials, when investigating the motivation, initially, it is not necessarily the case that everyone wants to use official power to pursue personal gain, but they are fascinated by the desire for fame. Later, when they enter the corrupt and dark officialdom, they involuntarily pursue power and profit, so that the original ambition to make a name for themselves and achieve merit is swept away. In fact, seeking fame is not a bad thing in itself, if it is done in the right way. As Sun Yat-sen said: "The height of the reputation of people in ancient and modern times is not in the greatness of the office they held, but in the success of the cause they pursued. If a cause can be successful, one can enjoy great fame." We are specifically mentioning this old saying at this time and place, hoping that those who are already in the officialdom will have an attitude of serving the country and the people and pursuing a career, and establish themselves through words and deeds. Those who are seeking official positions should still realistically do something beneficial for society. In this era of turmoil, we especially hope that people with aspirations will experience Sun Yat-sen's legacy and determine their path of life and career.</p>
<p>As for what counts as making a big impact? Sun Yat-sen also said, "As long as you have the ambition to serve the people, and focus on one thing, to help the country become rich and strong," that is an extraordinary undertaking. Simply put, anyone who works hard and steadfastly adheres to their position is pursuing a great personal undertaking. In addition to working hard in one's position, simultaneously serving the public interests of the country and society is pursuing a great cause for the country and society. For example, recently, the National Government appointed Mr. Min Daoding and Mr. Ding Mo Village as heads of Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, respectively, to carry out reforms in local areas, establish security, and stabilize people's livelihoods. All of this is based on the desire to serve the country and the people and to earnestly make an impact. Secondly, the most urgent tasks in Shanghai today, such as the dispersal of the population, the relocation of industries to the interior, the improvement of transportation, the implementation of agricultural loans, the purchase of relief bonds, and the promotion of charitable relief efforts, all of these are also great undertakings that social figures in this time and place should pursue. Therefore, we specifically put forward Sun Yat-sen's legacy, wishing everyone: "Aspire to make a big impact, not just to become a big official!"</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Makes the Enemy Bleed, Gradually Taking Effect: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Okinawa Battle</h3>
<p>The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon, where Minister Matsushima explained the latest battle situation on Okinawa Island. The enemy has suffered unprecedented losses, with nearly half of the landing soldiers having died, and resupply of troops has become extremely difficult. The Japanese military has gradually achieved its goal of making the enemy bleed. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Most of the Landing Enemy Forces Killed</p>
<p>Recently, in the battle situation on Okinawa Island, in the west at Naha, in the center north of Shuri, and in the east in the area of Yonabaru, Japanese and enemy forces are engaging in fierce battles. The enemy is attacking from the south, mobilizing four army divisions and two naval divisions, attempting to break through the lines, but each time they are attacked and suffer considerable damage. As of May 8th, according to enemy publications, 2,648 soldiers have died, and 13,741 have been injured or gone missing, for a total of 16,389. According to Lieutenant Colonel Hu Shideweida, a military doctor of the enemy's Tenth Army, another 3,967 injured soldiers have died, for a total of 6,615. In the past, when the enemy published the number of their soldiers killed or injured, it was usually only one-tenth of the actual loss. Therefore, based on this, it can be estimated that the enemy's loss of soldiers is at least 50,000 to 60,000. Of the 100,000 soldiers that the enemy landed on Okinawa Island, most have been killed or injured, and the resupply of troops has become quite difficult. The enemy lacks hospital ships and field hospitals, so they are unable to accommodate the injured and are using about ten transport planes a day to transport the injured. The enemy has also announced that in addition to the aforementioned number of deaths and injuries, 2,000 soldiers in the army and 4,000 in the navy are suffering from diseases. Based on this, it can be said that the Japanese military's efforts to make the enemy bleed have gradually taken effect, and the continuous attacks on their ships are also inflicting unprecedented damage on the enemy.</p>
<p>Enemy Navy is Unable to Strengthen</p>
<p>The enemy's mobile units attacked Kyushu on the 13th and 14th. Their force was composed of two groups consisting of six formal aircraft carriers and four battleships. Because of the Japanese military's fierce attack, the enemy has suffered serious damage. At least two aircraft carriers and several other ships have been sunk and are retreating south. At the same time, the Japanese military continues to fiercely attack the troops that have landed around Okinawa. On the 16th, it was seen from the land that a large enemy ship was sunk at sea, and another was on fire. The enemy has lost more than 500 ships and is experiencing considerable pain due to the lack of troops. Even if they can mobilize troops from Europe in the future, they will ultimately be unable to strengthen the first-line forces of their navy. The battle centered on Okinawa is now becoming increasingly heated, and the battle situation in the next one to two weeks is particularly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Enemy America Attempts to Dominate Two Oceans</p>
<p>Based on the end of the European war, the enemy has repeatedly announced that they will move a large number of troops and simultaneously promoted the effects of aerial warfare. Of course, this kind of statement is not impossible in the future, but the specific realization will definitely not be as simple as the promotion. Especially recently, the political relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, coupled with shipping problems and distance problems, are all very big tasks in enemy history, which cannot be easily undertaken. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 14th, American Navy Commander-in-Chief King requested in the Senate that the United States should establish several naval bases from the Philippine Islands all the way to the mouth of the Atlantic Ocean. King's request is nothing more than the manifestation of America's ambition to dominate the two oceans. The various kinds of peace they tout are merely a facade for a world peace theory that cannot give up weapons. At the San Francisco conference, the opinions of various countries were divided and unable to reach a consensus. The cooperation issues between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, the Polish problem, the Austrian problem, the Argentine problem, etc., could not be coordinated. On the 14th, the Polish regime automatically sent 1,000 Poles to Frankfurt on the Oder River in Germany. This kind of move was sudden and unexpected.</p>
<p>Finally, Colonel Matsushima said that according to a New York broadcast on the 16th, there was news that American troops had occupied Okinawa Island, and that Chongqing troops had occupied Fuzhou. This was actually false propaganda.</p>
<h3>Co-Prosperity Sphere Students Enter Kyoto Imperial University</h3>
<p>Kyoto, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Kyoto Imperial University previously recruited more than forty new students from various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The entrance ceremony was held on the 15th. In order to adapt to the world situation, a Student Education Council was established to hold seminars and various exercises. All international students have moved into student housing. Students from China and Manchukuo have moved into the Rakuto Apartments, and students from various southern regions have moved into the International Student Friendship Association.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarines Participate in the Atlantic Waters</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A dispatch from Washington states that the American Atlantic Fleet Commander, Ingram, met with a group of reporters on the 16th and announced that Japanese submarines were cooperating with German submarines in the Atlantic waters, which caused great shock. According to Ingram's statement, a certain American naval vessel encountered a Japanese submarine in the waters south of Long Island last summer. This is the first time that Japanese submarines have been discovered participating in the Atlantic commerce raiding war.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The American War Bulletin stated that the American Department of the Navy announced today that one American destroyer escort ship was sunk by a submarine in the Atlantic Ocean. The bulletin also stated that the American side had lost 308 ships in this war.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-American Aircraft Attack the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – At 1:55 PM and 4:30 PM on the 17th, an American Air Force bomber stationed in Chongqing twice intruded into the airspace over the outskirts of the capital and dropped flares and bombs on Pukou, causing slight damage to the ground.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Nagoya: 31 Shot Down; Part of Atsuta Shrine on Fire</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:40 PM on the 17th: "From around 2:00 AM on the 17th, for about two hours, approximately 100 B29-type aircraft from a southern base attacked the Nagoya area and dropped incendiary bombs on the city. A portion of the main hall, roof, and ancillary buildings of Atsuta Shrine caught fire. Fires also broke out in various locations within Nagoya City and were extinguished by daybreak. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle are that 9 enemy aircraft were shot down and 22 were destroyed."</p>
<p>Nagoya, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – One hundred B29-type aircraft from the Mariana Islands base attacked Nagoya at dawn on the 17th. On this day, the enemy aircraft, flying at an altitude of 3,000 or 5,000 meters, attacked Nagoya from the west from about 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM, singly or in small numbers. They dropped large 50-kilogram incendiary bombs and 22.5-kilogram electron-type explosive bombs, blindly bombing part of the main hall and company premises of Atsuta Shrine, and attacked the southern area, directly bombing the urban areas and some factories in the Nakamura, Atsuta, Mizuho, Denchuan, Showa, Nakae Harbor, and Chigusa districts. The Japanese military and civilians worked together to fight the fires and extinguished them at dawn. The enemy aircraft took their usual deceptive action. When the alarm was sounded, they flew west from the direction of Lake Biwa and did not appear over Nagoya, but an hour later, they suddenly changed course and intruded into Nagoya. At the same time, they scattered tinfoil to disrupt the Japanese radio wave detectors. However, the Japanese air defense forces immediately launched a fierce attack on them, and ground fire also fired fiercely into the air. As a result, nine were shot down and twenty-two were destroyed.</p>
<p>Aerial Attacks on Korea and Taiwan</p>
<p>Seoul, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Korean Military District Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 17th: "At around 11:00 AM on the 17th, four large enemy aircraft, in formations of two, attacked the west coast of North Jeolla Province and the western and southern coasts of South Jeolla Province. They all retreated south at around 1:30 PM. The Japanese side sustained no damage."</p>
<p>Taipei, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 16th during the day, approximately 70 enemy bombers and approximately 10 enemy fighter planes took off from a base in the Philippine Islands and attacked the areas of Taichung, Tainan, and Hsinchu. A portion of them intruded near Yuli and strafed port cities with machine guns. They retreated south at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Grasshopper Extermination in the Outskirts of the Capital Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Under the close cooperation of various relevant departments, the grasshopper extermination work in the outskirts of the capital is actively underway. Since the 15th, most of the students of agricultural schools in the capital have also voluntarily gone to participate in the extermination. It is reported that there are currently two extermination methods being implemented in the area. One is the encirclement method, which involves placing a white flag in the area with the most grasshoppers and having villagers surround the area, holding bamboo whips and killing them as they move forward, with the white flag as the center, until they are completely exterminated. The other is the ditch method, which involves digging ditches around the area with the most grasshoppers, with a narrow bottom and wide opening, and filling them with water. Oil is placed on the surface of the water, and the grasshoppers are driven into the water and drowned. In addition, the Chinese Cooperative recently prepared dozens of bolts of white cloth, cut them into rectangles, and ordered farmers to use them in areas with many grasshoppers to attract them to jump onto the cloth, then pour them into bags and burn them.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Report: An Account of Inspecting Western Hunan</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 16th, He Yingqin, Chief of the General Staff of the Chongqing military, who had previously inspected the war situation in western Hunan Province, returned to Chongqing on the 14th. He immediately attended the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, reporting on the deployment status of troops on various fronts and the situation of his inspection of the western Hunan front.</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie's Remarks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a telegram from Chongqing, Wang Shijie, the Minister of Propaganda of Chongqing, stated the following on the 16th: The Special Committee of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang will convene a National Assembly to establish a constitutional government on November 12th. The authority and participating representatives of the National Assembly, as well as issues other than the date of establishment, cannot be finalized before the National Political Council in early July. This meeting can also conduct various reviews outside of the Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Nelson to Remain as Economic Advisor in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A telegram from Chongqing states that the Chongqing government authorities announced that Nelson, who recently resigned as an envoy representing Truman, will continue to serve as an economic advisor.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Problem: British Compromise Strategy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A British communiqué stated that the British delegation attending the San Francisco Conference received a telegram from London last night. The telegram instructed the United States and Britain on how to adopt a compromise approach regarding the issue of trusteeship. At the same time, the telegram containing instructions on compromise strategies has been immediately submitted to the Trusteeship Committee. It is reported that the telegram carefully pointed out that there should be freedom to propose amendments in the Trusteeship Committee, and that the existing mandated territories of various countries should not be changed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A British communiqué stated that the Soviet delegation stationed in San Francisco strongly opposed the suggestion made by the United Kingdom at the conference that the "International Labor Organization" should have a particularly important status in the world's major charters.</p>
<h3>Eden Returns to London</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – British radio broadcast that British Foreign Secretary Eden returned from San Francisco to London on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Meets Churchill; Britain Announces Four Serious Problems</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – London radio broadcast last night that General Eisenhower paid a visit to Prime Minister Churchill yesterday. At the same time, General Bedell Smith arrived in London on Thursday, and it is widely believed that he will return to Germany soon.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Reuters correspondent Kish reported that British Prime Minister Churchill announced four serious problems to the outside world and solicited appropriate countermeasures. The four problems are as follows: The current and future status of the Dönitz government and the complete disarmament of the German army. The issue of distributing or reorganizing the occupied areas in accordance with past agreements. It is widely believed that the areas currently occupied by British and American forces have crossed the demarcation line. The establishment of a "Central Governing Council." If we infer General Montgomery's actions from General Alexander's occupation of Austria and the Mediterranean, then General Montgomery seems to also have the ambition to take similar actions on behalf of the British government. The problem of food panic caused by the increase of homeless people from twenty million to fifty million.</p>
<p>German People Plunged into Famine</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Reuters special correspondent Martin stated that the German military government of the Twenty-First Army has stipulated restrictions on the distribution of food ration cards to the German people. Therefore, the general German public is threatened by famine. At the same time, the restriction on food ration cards will continue until the British military authorities have resolved the supply of food before it can be lifted.</p>
<h3>Surrendered German Submarines Reach Fifty</h3>

<h3>Current Status of the Shangchuan Railway</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>The Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Office of the Municipal Construction Bureau, having repaired and refurbished all the passenger cars and locomotives running on Shangchuan Road, specially invited officials of the competent authorities and reporters from various newspapers to visit Qioning Temple at 9:30 a.m. yesterday to observe the new facilities, inspect traffic order, the condition of the terminal, and tour the locomotive factory. Afterwards, a simple ceremony was held.</p>
<p>Those visiting included Xu Jidun, Director of the Construction Bureau, as well as Wang Lian, Chief of the First Section, Shang Zheng, Chief of the Third Section, Liang Miaozhang, Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Government Secretariat, and more than ten reporters from various newspapers. The hosts included Zhao Haiqing, Director of the Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Office, Zhang Pengcheng, Director of Training, Shi Youxin, Director of the Business Section, and Cheng Yiping.</p>
<p>Process of Renovation</p>
<p>The Shangchuan Railway was built in 1925, initially as a commercial venture, and was transferred to municipal ownership four years ago. It is 48 li long and takes one hour to travel. It is a type of light railway similar to those used in mines. The locomotives and passenger cars were all produced in Germany more than 20 years ago. These vehicles have long been weathered and repeatedly damaged. Currently, there is one locomotive that has been completely repaired and is like new, three 40-foot passenger cars, one 28-foot passenger car, and one 28-foot freight car. The repair costs and replacement parts cost only 3.47 million yuan. In addition to the new doors and windows and other fittings, the newly renovated locomotive runs faster and consumes less coal. The entire line currently uses about 180 tons of coal per month, of which 80 tons are allocated coal priced at 40,000 yuan per ton, and the remaining 100 tons or so are purchased at the black market price of about 200,000 yuan per ton. There are also two old locomotives and seven old passenger and freight cars that need to be repaired, but the required parts are difficult to find and the purchase price is too high, which still requires the assistance of the authorities to resolve. Some of the sleepers have already been replaced, and the current price is about 20,000 yuan per piece. To reduce the risk of derailment, they also urgently need to be replaced, and they are currently planning to purchase old sleepers from the China Railway.</p>
<p>Current Business Situation</p>
<p>The current train departure times are 12:00 noon and 5:30 p.m. from Qioning Temple, passing through Jinjiaqiao, Xinlu, Shaojiaxiang, Caojialu, Dawan, Xiaowan, Muziqiao, Chuansha, and Xiaoyingfang to Jiangzhen. Departures from Jiangzhen are at 9:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. The passenger ticket price from Qioning Temple to Chuansha is 790 yuan, and the full fare is 940 yuan. Freight tickets are halved. A 10% transfer tax is collected with the ticket. Military and police personnel are given preferential treatment and are issued exchange coupons to exchange for military and police tickets. Tickets are sold as much as possible, and those who are found to be deliberately evading tickets will be fined five times the fare. Before the reform, in addition to many people riding without tickets, there were also strange phenomena of military and police ordering forced stops and boarding at any time and place. Now, however, the trains depart and arrive on time. Most of the passengers are farmers, and some are small merchants. What they bring is mostly soap, cigarettes, matches, etc., and what they transport are mainly salt and rural products.</p>
<p>Employee Benefits</p>
<p>The two road management offices currently have a total of more than 240 employees. When Director Zhao first took office, there were only 180 employees. After the reform, the affairs were busy, and the income also increased sharply. In February, it was 21,494,232 yuan, in March it was 46,613,144 yuan, and in April it reached 50,257,280 yuan. The surplus profit turned over to the municipal treasury in March was 10,040,830 yuan. The treatment of employees has also been thoroughly improved. In addition to the basic salary, 10% of the turnover is allocated each month as employee subsidies. This subsidy was about equal to one month’s basic salary last month. Middle-level employees receive more than 70,000 or 80,000 yuan each month, and they can also receive three dou of free rice. In the past, there were incidents of employees starving to death. Recently, seeing the generous treatment, technical workers who had left the locomotive factory have returned one after another. Thanks to the stability of life and effective supervision, road construction is proceeding in a tense and enthusiastic manner.</p>
<p>As Director Zhao said, "The two roads are like a sick man, and it is very difficult for the doctor." However, in just three months, with the tireless work day and night of all employees, there has been a great improvement. Yesterday, Director Xu of the Construction Bureau praised it very appropriately, saying: "It is not surprising to achieve something in a good environment. It is very commendable and respectable to be able to achieve such achievements in a short period of time after great destruction under conditions where funds, materials, personnel, and politics are very difficult!"</p>

<h3>The Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads: Reorganization Work Completed; Yesterday, the Press Was Invited to View the New Trains</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Construction Bureau through the merger and reorganization of the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Works Bureau, it has been actively developing public utilities and improving vehicle traffic, achieving remarkable results. Previously, the Upper and Lower Sichuan Railways suffered from poor management, and the trains and military vehicles were in disrepair for many years, causing inconvenience to passengers and greatly affecting the business of merchants traveling between the urban area and the suburbs. Therefore, the newly appointed director of the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads Administration, Zhao Haiqing, was instructed to strengthen the internal organization, rectify road administration, and repair locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. After three months of effort, not only has the internal reorganization been completed, but also one old No. 1 locomotive, one 40-foot passenger car, one 28-foot passenger car, and one 28-foot freight car on the Upper Sichuan Road have been repaired, painted, and are as good as new. They were put into operation yesterday (the 17th). Director Zhao of the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads Administration specially invited Municipal Construction Bureau Director Xu, Secretary Liang Miao-zhang, First Section Chief Wang Lian, and Third Section Chief Shang Zheng to visit yesterday, and also invited reporters from various newspapers in the city to visit the new trains in operation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting the Locomotives</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th) at 9:30 AM, Director Xu of the Municipal Construction Bureau, section chiefs, and reporters from various newspapers gathered at the Outer Bund No. 14 Municipal Ferry Terminal. They were warmly received by Director Zhao and others from the Administration. At 10:00 AM, they departed on the "Chunjiang" Municipal Ferry to cross the river. At 10:40 AM, they arrived at the Qingning Temple Pier. After disembarking and resting briefly at the Roads Administration, they were accompanied by Director Zhao to visit the newly renovated locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, and inspected the repair situation. At 12:00 PM, after the new trains started running, they inspected the condition of the terminal station and visited the locomotive factory facilities. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Director Zhao convened a meeting of the heads of various sections and senior police officers of the two roads to introduce them to Director Xu for instruction and training. Director Zhao also reported on the rectification of road administration, the repair of vehicles, and the future plans for promoting road administration. Afterwards, photographs were taken, and a luncheon was hosted. At 3:00 PM sharp, they returned to Shanghai by the "Jiejiang" ferry.</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>Director Xu of the Municipal Construction Bureau gave an address, stating in brief: Transportation is of great importance to the promotion of national politics and the prosperity of industry and commerce. The progress of railways in various countries around the world has become like spider silk, because railway progress is inextricably linked to culture, economy, politics, and military affairs. Our country's railway administration is lagging behind other countries in the world and should follow the road administration of other countries and strive for progress. The Upper and Lower Sichuan Railways are local railways and should be improved with local resources. Although they cannot be compared with foreign railways, if we can maintain the existing railway conditions and promote them gradually, it will be our duty. We must manage and promote with our own strength. In the past, a certain director of the Public Utilities Bureau promoted them and achieved good results. Now, Director Zhao is actively reorganizing, and in the shortest period of three months, he has achieved practical progress, which is due to the efforts of everyone and the assistance of our allies. I hope that there will be even greater progress in the future, that vehicles will be increased, and that the exchange of materials will be smoother. I hope that the local people will cherish the railway.</p>
<p>Director's Report</p>
<p>Director Zhao of the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads Administration reported, stating in brief: I was ordered to manage the road administration of the two roads. First, during the reorganization period, I strengthened the internal organization, adjusted personnel, increased salaries, stabilized work, and strengthened the spirit of road protection. Second, during the construction period, I renovated locomotives and repaired roads to ensure the safety of passengers. Both of these periods have been successfully completed. In the future, we will continue to replace sleepers along the road and connect the Jiangzhen to Zhengzhen directly to the Shijiawu sections. This time, the renovation of six locomotives and passenger cars cost 3.47 million yuan in repair expenses.</p>
<p>Business Conditions</p>
<p>It is reported that the station names along the Upper and Lower Sichuan Roads are as follows: The Upper Sichuan Line starts from Qingning Temple and passes through Jinjia Bridge, Xinlu, Shaojia Nong, Caojia Road, Gongjia Road, Dawan, Xiaohui, Muzi, Chuansha, Xiaoyingfang, and ends at Jiangzhen, a total of twelve stations. The Lower Sichuan Line starts from Zhoupu and passes through Tianhua'an, Sanlin Tang, Yangxing Bridge, Dadaokou, and ends at Zhoujiadu, a total of six points. Recently, due to active reorganization, traffic safety and passenger convenience have increased, and business is becoming more and more prosperous. In recent March and April business, the monthly passenger count reached 80,000, with over 20,000 pieces of freight, generating an income of approximately 50 million yuan.</p>

<h3>No Fees Charged for Population Census Forms</h3>

Recently, in order to investigate the population of the newly designated urban area and the shantytowns, the office has printed population census registers, which are being distributed by the Baojia (community) organizations to be filled out, so that they can be used for issuing certificates. However, it has been heard that some people are falsely charging fees for the census registers and procedures. The reporter specially visited the person in charge of the office yesterday and was informed that the population census registers are printed and distributed by the office and no fees are charged. If such a situation is discovered, it can be reported at any time, and it will be dealt with severely.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Staff Loan Office Decides to Increase Loan Amounts; If Necessary, It Can Be Increased to 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Staff Loan Office is jointly established by fourteen financial institutions in the city, with the main purpose of providing loans to alleviate the urgent needs of industrial and commercial staff. Since it started accepting applications on January 15 this year, up to April 30, a total of 845 people have applied. A total of 457 people have been approved for loans, with a total loan amount of 17,325,000 yuan, including 3,535,000 yuan for tuition fees, 6,045,000 yuan for medical expenses, 1,480,000 yuan for small business operations, 1,355,000 yuan for funeral expenses, 4,780,000 yuan for repatriation expenses, and 130,000 yuan for other purposes. The situation of loan repayment is also very good. A total of 4,170,000 yuan has been received. In summary, within three months, almost all of the matured bills have been recovered, which proves the creditworthiness of industrial and commercial staff. Now, the office, in view of the good past performance and the current high prices, has decided to increase the loan limit to 100,000 yuan if necessary, starting from the 16th of this month, and extend the repayment period to a maximum of ten months. For loan guarantors, if they are reliable, the number can be reduced to one, and the guarantor is exempted from signing the application form and endorsing the check, so as to provide quick and easy convenience for honest and diligent industrial and commercial staff. However, at the same time, it is hoped that the service organizations will provide proof and deduct salaries as much as possible, and the office will also use written guarantee procedures to ensure proper handling. The daily application time is still from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, and it is closed on Sundays and bank holidays. The address is on the fourth floor of the Silk Industry Building, 470 Hankou Road.</p>
