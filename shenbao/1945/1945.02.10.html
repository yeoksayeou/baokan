<h3>巴希格河南一帶日構築堅强陣地　馬尼刺北部展開熾烈砲戰</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　據呂宋電稱：馬尼刺守軍自三日以來，於北部地區各要衝邀擊侵入市內之敵軍，予以重創後，於七日下午一時已將陣地轉移至巴希格河後方，嗣復猛攻於巴希格河南方地區前進之敵戰車及步兵部隊，結果除阻止敵軍之前進外，並予重創。又自三日至五日之三日間，僅於市北部方面之局部戰鬥中，已斃敵五百餘名，並破壞敵大砲數門及裝甲車二十餘輛。又對企圖自馬尼刺南方尼科拉斯機塲侵入馬尼刺南之敵軍，亦奮勇應戰中，現敵軍雖遭日軍痛擊，損失已極重大，但仍執拗企圖遮斷據守馬尼刺市東方高地之日軍主力部隊，以期切斷與市內日軍之連絡。五日傍晚，敵於馬尼刺市北方約十五公里之科抒市，集結以戰車爲主力之攻擊部隊，採取自馬尼刺東方作大迂迴南下之情勢，現日軍對該方面敵軍正予以猛攻，而力謀粉碎其南下企圖。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據呂宋前綫報吿稱：日軍於巴希格河南部中心，構築强力之陣地，邀擊美軍之進攻，並與馬尼刺北部美軍展開熾烈之砲擊戰，五日夜因美軍之轟炸及砲擊，馬尼刺最繁華之街市發生大火，延燒兩畫三夜，因之馬尼刺之最大百貨店·大劇塲·銀行·飯店已完全化爲烏有，唐人街一半亦已燬盡。美軍因大火及日軍猛烈反攻，其作戰似已益受阻害。同時巴納安半島高地一帶日軍，依據山間構築陣地，與美軍第三十八師團部隊展開激烈之密林戰。</p>
<p>繁華市街化成火海</p>
<p>呂宋前綫萬地九　中央社電　三日午後侵入馬尼刺北部之敵軍一部，至七日已形成對馬尼刺中部及南部地區之本格攻摯。自二日至七日於馬尼刺北部地區之戰鬥狀况，綜合情形如次：自巴納安方西南下之敵騎兵第一師團，三日進抵馬克羅斯東方，同日晚，其中一部到達馬尼刺市北端，敵以遊擊隊汽車隊及裝甲車隊，包抄由日軍陣地之間隙道路，於午後五時左右突入馬尼刺市街北部，而侵入聖多馬斯大學之南部收容所。至午後十時左右，防守馬尼刺之日軍，按預定計劃，破壞巴希格河橋頭及一部軍事設施，同日敵於深夜並突入聖多馬斯大學附近。又市內之警備極佳，治安方面恢復極速，自四日晚起，敵第一騎兵師團及第三十七歲兵團，與　律賓匪軍共同侵入馬尼刺市北側，敵兵力原有戰車百七十輛·汽車五百輛·火砲四門，其餘各種車輛共約千五百輛，兵員一三〇〇名以上，對此日陸海軍於互相協力下，當於市街東方及北方，連日展開壯烈之市街戰，以中央車站至馬拉加安大總統官邸間一帶爲最凄烈。經三日夜間，日軍之挺身突擊隊突入敵軍據守之大總統官邸，擊毀敵戰車二輛，擊敵兵五十餘名。敵當市街戰時，因使用燒夷彈，馬尼刺最　華之里沙爾街及埃斯克爾特街一帶，連日被猛火所包圍，日軍於猛烈大火中死守據點，更勇敢死鬥，予敵損害極大，故馬尼刺市內之戰鬥，兩軍已於巴希格河以北地區繼續擊鬥中，巴希格南島之馬尼刺重要地區，仍由日守備軍確保中。日軍自六日來，對南島地區曾加以砲擊，同時敵軍之一部與匪軍曾襲擊馬尼刺市南郊尼克拉斯菲爾特機塲，該方面之日軍於六日似繼續對南方敵軍壓迫中。因敵軍頃在馬尼刺週圍地區，集合有二三師之兵力，企圖進行本格攻擊，故馬尼刺市內之巷戰或將愈趨熾烈，現日軍正予敵極大損害，勇敢奮戰中。</p>
<p>雙方決戰僅開端倪</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　敵美以侵入馬尼刺爲契機而大事宣傳，此無異謂菲律賓作戰即將結束，然日軍仍於呂宋島嚴密佈陣，故眞正之决戰尙在今後，此點即虛構宣傳之美國首腦亦不得不率直承認。前美駐菲長官馬克那特廣播稱：縱然佔領馬尼刺，但日軍强力部隊仍於呂宋島佈陣，若不將此項日軍擊退，實不能認爲菲律賓作戰業已終了。又前駐日大使現國務副卿格魯亦稱，馬尼刺之陷落，僅可謂於日美决戰之緒端，若以此認爲已結束菲律賓作戰，實大錯誤。</p>
<p>日軍潛力不容輕視</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據底特律電稱：美海軍次官戈夫七日曾於底特律演說，謂美軍今日於太平洋雖已於數處得到進展，但日軍依然備有有力兵力及裝備優秀之精銳部隊，且日本飛機及其兵器之生產，已漸次增大，於兵員方面日軍亦有多數之預備兵力，彼等均具有與美軍作戰必勝之决意，率直言之，現在戰局僅可謂係美軍正式試騐日軍防衛力之開始。吾等接近東京愈近，日陸海軍之防衛力亦必更强化。於菲律實羣島中，日軍二三年來已建有多數之機塲，美軍於過去之空戰中已受相當損失，今後進攻太平洋時，其損害必更增大，吾人現在必須注意日軍將有使用火箭彈及噴射推進式飛機之可能云。</p>
<h3>松島部長　談日軍新戰略　日本海軍空軍化</h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬陸海外三當局主持之聯合報道常會，昨日下午三時假南京路匯中飯店舉行，到艦隊報道部松島部長，松本大尉，囑託林俊夫，王炳南，劉鎭南，大使館上海事務所松平部長，福問副頷事等，由松島部長發表談話闡明菲島戰局之演進，日軍在菲島作戰上，引用新戰略，給予敵美以最大消耗，並加以擊滅，以及敵美在太平洋方面人力及補給方面遭受之種種困難。茲分誌演詞如下：</p>
<p>日軍作戰使敵消耗</p>
<p>關於菲律賓戰况，最近在馬尼拉市內，正展開激烈巷戰，日軍方面始終使敵軍作最大犧牲及最大消耗。敵美司令官麥克沃塞發表馬尼拉已陷落，呂宋島亦在彼壓制下，雖彼如此宣傳，但日方山下將軍所統率之睦軍部隊，及大川內將軍統率之海軍部隊，究在何處存在，事關作戰秘密，自不能使敵方得知。日方作戰方法，乃避免主力大會戰，而使敵美多量消耗，在可能範圍內，引誘美軍力量聚集呂宋島一帶，予以擊滅。日方爲準備戰力關係，以阻碍敵軍之進攻，因此遂有山下及大川內兩將軍之戰法展開。過去雷伊泰島方面，至少牽制敵軍兵力在十個師團以上，而現在馬尼拉方面所牽制之美軍兵力當數倍於雷伊島。</p>
<p>偉大戰果即將出現</p>
<p>萬一呂宋島失陷，因日軍作戰方式之轉變，呂宋所受損失，亦極有限。日方保護呂宋島之意義，在維護日本本土及南方補給路線，倘呂宋島失陷，表面上看來南方及日本補給上或不無影響，但現在日方戰略轉變，改變過去保護呂宋維持南方資源的戰略，而採用新的戰略。所謂新的戰路，將航空機作爲第一重點，在日本本土及中國大陸特殊地形，並在一極狹溢之海面上擊滅敵人。尤其在中日協力上說，此種戰略極有意義。以航空機爲第一重點，很顯著的現像，即日本海軍空軍化。查航空機產生以來，已達三十年以上，在日方向以艦船爲主要兵力，航空機爲輔助兵力，前在馬來及夏威夷作戰，重創敵人，即係此種配　。現日主採取新戰略，以航空機爲主力，並非艦船缺乏，或艦船力量不及飛機力量，此在夏威夷戰中已表現過，可爲明說。現在作戰方式改變後，今後主要海空軍作戰，如過去艦隊出動情形，非必要時，不輕易實現。際此日航空威力尙未表面化，極大效果未出現前，各種狀態均暫停頓，相信不久，即將有驚人之效果表現。</p>
<p>敵美人力更感困難</p>
<p>其次美軍的弱點，一爲人的資源不足，在雷伊泰島作戰，牽制美軍二十個師團，今後在大陸或接近日本本土地帶，美國人的資源定感更爲困難。二爲兵器燃料補充問題，以輸送路綫太長，如盟邦德國攻至斯達林格勒後同樣情形，不久敵美即將遭逢此種輸送上極大困難。</p>
<p>敵方謀略乘機造謠</p>
<p>最近上海謠言繁興，最近有人見帶皮　的日軍，即乘機造謠，此不過部隊移動，以如此廣大的中國，從北部移來帶皮帽軍隊，何足爲奇。尤有一種令人不可思議的謠言，爲欲保護上海安全，希望上海日軍撤退，使上海爲不設防城市，此係受敵方及共黨策略的誘惑，假使本中日提携同生共死的觀點，此種謠言，决不致發生。日人無論軍官民一致奮鬥，必要時雖完全玉碎而不惜，以防英美之侵略中國。如中國有智識者能領略日人心理，則此種謠言，自然消滅矣。日本在大東亞戰爭進行作戰，不斤斤於局部之勝敗，其最大方針爲保護日本本土及中國大陸之安全，及使敵美盡最出血盡量消耗是也。</p>
<h3>B29型敵機　盲炸西貢市　法越人民表示憤懣</h3>
<p>西貢九日中央社電　七日B29型機曾肓炸西貢市內，致建築物及民房之損毀及死傷者，達相當數目。據當地法政府當局於該日下午七時發表稱：七日正午美重轟炸機侵入西貢堤岸地區，醫院及住宅發生損害，因此次完全對住宅中心街市加以盲炸，故法人與該地居民所受影響頗大。敵一再宣傳稱，不殺法人及安南人，至此已畢露其殘暴面目，而尤其醫院因受盲炸而致犧牲者甚多，法方軍官民對此種非人道行爲，均極表示憤懣。</p>
<h3>敵潛水艇二艘　在太平洋擊沉</h3>
<p>西南太平洋某基地六日中央社電　日軍航空部隊過去數日間，於西南太平洋方面擊沉敵潛水艇二艘。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>馬尼刺戰局展望</h3>
<p>以馬尼刺爲中心，這幾天菲律賓戰事較趨　　。</p>
<p>敵美前次當在仁牙因一帶登陸之時，曾打算於一星期或十天之內，即一舉而攻下馬尼刺；經强大日軍以出血戰術猛烈抗禦，敵蒙受重大損失，終難如願以償。</p>
<p>自一月末至二月初間，敵攻勢轉猛；同時，日軍在一部份地區以戰略任務完成，略向後撤，戰事始迫近了馬尼刺。敵美對馬尼刺是採取半圓形攻勢。主要部隊由仁牙因越呂宋島中部平原，經聖法南多一帶南下，攻馬尼刺之北。在西南面，則由馬尼刺西北方蘇此格灣進襲及馬尼刺灣東南方的巴打半島北上，與南下部隊相呼應。二月三日自聖法南多南下的美軍，首先突入馬尼刺市的北部地區，展開激戰。</p>
<p>估計敵美侵入呂宋島進攻馬尼刺的兵力，現約達十一師以上。其中八師左右陸續來自仁牙因灣，二師左右方新於一月底從馬尼刺西北的蘇比格灣登陸，另一部份則屬馬尼刺灣西南方那斯克布登陸的部除。這些兵力的分佈狀况，大致在仁牙因以及東北方高地側面克拉克菲特周圍約二師，馬尼刺方面約二師，蘇比格區約二師，那斯克布區約二師，集中於呂宋島的西中南各部份，即形成所謂對馬尼刺半圓形攻勢。</p>
<p>在呂宋島之外，雷伊泰等島的日軍，目下仍保留强大的作戰力量。敵美爲牽制日軍，最近對菲律賓中部及南部各島，也進行侵入作戰。一月中旬起，敵軍並於南部蘇魯羣鳥（北婆羅洲東北）實行登睦戰。又於中部宿務島一帶海域，不斷侵擾。雷伊泰島和宿務島中間的婆羅島，也有登陸，都遭受日軍的還擊而蒙重創。再於蘇門答臘巨港地區，敵英機動部隊爲呼應敵美在菲律賓作戰，近日也時來侵擾，但經日軍迎擊後，敵英有損無得。</p>
<p>敵美所以這樣急迫地要攻取馬尼刺，是有其如意算盤的。</p>
<p>第一，敵美企圖，而且主觀上也以爲於佔領馬尼刺後，即可底定呂宋島，從而解決菲律賓戰事。其實菲律賓各島日軍精壯部隊都還大量散在，以菲律賓島嶼的衆多，地形的複雜，敵美要在菲島安枕，實難中尤難。且馬尼刺目前在戰略上已無多大價値，該地的得失，實無足輕重。</p>
<p>第二，敵美又打算於菲律賓獲得進展後，即以呂宋諸島做據點，建立空軍根據地及海軍給養站，進而侵擾台灣和中關沿海，並擴大其空中遊擊戰，包括日本本土在內。這一打算也必然落空。因爲一方面即如上述，菲島日軍今後仍能予以牽制。另一方面，不輕易出動的日本强大海軍部隊方待機殲敵，敵美再前進，必遭比過去在台灣海所遭受的更慘重的打擊無疑。又粵漢路旣已打通，中國沿海防禦增强，敵美登陸妄想，顯然更多一層阻礙。</p>
<p>第三，敵美還企岡拿佔領馬尼刺以作爲其宣傳攻勢的張本。馬尼刺是菲律賓首都（現菲政府已遷都於呂宋島北部），佔領馬尼刺，想使一般人心理上造成美國已克服菲律賓的歪曲印象，並借此從事作誇大狂吹的各種宣傳。這也是徒然的，祗要日軍仍可在各島立足活動，這一宣傳必歸無效。</p>
<p>總之，馬尼刺一地的得失，決不是便即決定了菲律賓的戰事，更不致怎樣影響整個大東亞戰局。但是，我們也不能忽視局勢的嚴重，須更加愼重應付嚴叛的局勢，更加積極協力戰爭，突破艱難，毀滅敵美一切妄想，奪回東亞民族的自由，中華民族的自由。</p>
<h3>緬甸八莫附近　日軍獲戰果　襲南卡橋敵機擊落八架</h3>
<p>緬甸北部前綫九日中央社電　自八莫附近地區孟多公路逐步南下之渝第六軍所部新編第二十二師及第五十師一部，受八莫日守軍之猛攻，遭受潰滅的打擊，失去與第六軍之連絡，完全陷於混亂狀態，致不得不中止行動。迨至最近單獨再向南進，一月二十八日拂曉在向孟龍（孟米多北方二十五公里）附近有渝軍數百來襲，經日軍接連二次勇猛突擊後，遂至潰退，遺棄屍體及俘虜甚衆，又該日晚於孟龍東方二百米高地，擁有多數迫擊砲機關槍之渝軍數百，曾向日軍陣前侵攻，但蒙受重創，向北潰退。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫日軍基地九日中央社電　敵空軍爲相應自畹町及南康方面之攻擊，乃屢次窺犯日軍後方，二十九日敵機累計三十八架來襲臘戊至畹町間之　緬公路之南卡橋，（省城西北三十四公里）而施以轟炸或掃射，經該方面日軍防空部隊擊落其八架，並予以若干損害後，始行遁走。</p>
<h3>固體酒類　製造成功</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　大日本麥酒科學研究所，前以啤酒·威斯忌·及淸酒之液體酒類，于輸送上已久惑不便，曾研究酒類之固體化，頃已研究成功，即以往飲用之威斯忌啤酒等，今已可能變爲可食之固體食物。其製作內容大致如次：（一）「固體酒精」此係大阪工塲製作成功之固體酒精，係由葡萄糖加琥珀酸，即成可食之日本淸酒及威斯忌，送往前綫，極爲便利，酒味極甘，對航空機及潛水艇搭乘員等，尤爲適宜。（一）「速成啤酒素」該啤酒素送往戰地後，由當地將其溶解後，即成爲液體啤酒素，目的在使前綫將兵一飽酒　。該素係用砂糖水漿及忽布，外加少量之酵母所製成者，形如牛奶糖之小塊，將此小塊之啤酒素，用炭酸水溶解後，即成啤酒，可於二十四小時之內，自由使用，此係東京工塲製造成功者。</p>
<h3>納爾遜操縱　渝軍需生產</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）據重慶到達此間之一靑年談，去年八月間美派納爾遜推進渝方軍需生產，於軍需生產局成立後，重慶昆明成都及其他西北方面設立新廠，納爾遜先後派美人入內担任顧問者，業有三十四人之多，致該廠悉爲美人所操縱，即戰時生產局長翁文源，亦徒有其名，實則爲美籍顧問所把握，致蔣介石氏對此極爲不滿，最近印度至重慶之公路闢成，重慶爲把握該公路之實權，擬以「蔣介石公路」名之，而美國表示反對，命名曰「斯蒂威爾公路」，再三商討結果，定名爲「斯蒂威爾公路」，管理局長亦由美人充任，重慶當局表面雖無異議，其實不甚愜意，結果美唯有派黑人至該公路担任運輸工作云。</p>
<h3>美生產减少</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　據可靠方面消息，美國目去年十月後戰時景氣不良，軍需品之生產亦漸减少，統計去年十一月時，其軍需生產量已減少至六成，嗣後華府當局雖曾竭力企圖恢復生產，唯時至今日，不但不能實現，社會生活上反發生種種缺陷。據最近傳來消息稱：美國內煤及食糧之　乏程度，至爲嚴重，本年一月二十六日華府當局曾命令國內卅九州對所有公共塲所燃煤之配給，一概停止，（人民煤之配給早已停頓）二月一日再度命令所有電力消費減少一半，翌日復停止東部紐約，本雪凡尼，俄黃俄等五州利用鐵道運輸民需品四天，在紐約更停止客車之運行，同時宣佈行政　嚴，以防民衆暴動。據該政府當局之說明，此種恐慌全係國內燃煤及人力匱乏所致，據稱美國內煤之產量，自去歲十二月以後，每月短少一千萬頓，軍需工廠之勞働力亦少七十萬人，致造成上述之結果，復悉美軍需品之產量，現較前大爲減少，其中以飛機坦克車膠皮車胎及流星彈等武器，生產時妨碍尤多云。</p>
<h3>經委會統計局彙編調查專刊</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　全國經濟委員會統計局，自去歲成立後，即展開一般經濟概况之調查工作，茲該局擬於近期內將年來各項調查統計所得，彙編專刋，以供各有關方面之參考，現已積極編繕中</p>
<h3>凌海軍部長發表　目前戰局觀感　敵美犯戰略重大錯誤</h3>
<p>新任海軍部長凌　氏，因公於前日由京來滬，預定在滬勾留數日，對本市各方面作就任後首次拜會，並視察海軍部各駐滬機關。中央社記者特於昨日趨訪凌海長於私邸，叩詢對目前戰局感觀，並我國海軍槪况，承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>近代作戰　自大東亞戰爭　發後，友邦陸海將士舊勇抗敵，三年於茲，其煌輝戰果爲全世界人士所驚異。此種爲國効忠堅毅卓絕之精神，實爲吾人所敬佩，敵英美經此長期打擊，損失慘重，非經數年準備，不能恢復，而目前所需軍需物費，日形貧乏，其補給之困難，生產之減低，均足以使其疲於應付戰爭。今者敵人冒戰略上大忌，跋涉長途海洋，深侵東亞腹地，此點實屬重大錯誤。况目前戰爭不在一地一城之得失，而在如何消耗敵軍之戰力，是以太平洋諸島雖爲其僥倖佔領，但以軍事觀點上說，實無重大價値。目前雖馬尼刺已被敵軍侵入，但四周友邦海陸將士，採取邀擊態勢，使敵人大量流血，此即所謂「出血戰術」。據本人觀測，近代作戰飛機重於戰艦，友邦飛機產量日增，海上戰鬥部隊得其强有力之空軍，陣容更見堅强。况敵方補給路綫遙長，我方接濟基地近在咫尺，此亦我方處有利地位。</p>
<p>我國海軍　國府還都時，友邦基於道義立塲，沿海基地，交還我國，並協力培養海軍，數年以來，海軍已由萌芽而至新生階段，本部於此數年間，積極訓練海軍員兵，目前力量雖不足以出從擊敵，但於友邦協力之下，全國海防任務，已爲我海軍所擔負，全體將士咸具殺敵雄心。而以目前情勢而言，敵軍疲於奔命之際，欲孤軍深入，侵犯國土，目前尙不可能，倘敵軍冒險，趨夢想於事實，來侵我沿海岸，則我人經磨練枕戈待旦之海軍，正好予敵迎頭痛擊之機會。</p>
<p>今日茶會　凌氏於昨日下午一時分訪周市長，友邦駐華艦隊司令長官近藤大將，上海海軍陸戰隊司令官，海軍武官府，上海根據地司令部，作就任后首次之拜會，晚應近藤大將歡宴。並定今（十）日下午四時，假座水交社舉行茶會，招待本市中外各界來賓，藉資聯歡。</p>

<h3>經濟警察當局　嚴禁菜蔬抬價　會同軍警澈查米價漲風</h3>
<p>本市經濟警察當局，以邇來時屆年底，一般不法商人　顧法令，乘機　動，擅抬物價，以致百物漲風，又復日熾，民生受嚴重威脅。故經於本月七日起出動全體經濟警察，全面實施澈查物價，對暴利者予以拘辦。當於七日由各分隊分別在各該區內，查得一般菜蔬攤販，圖牟暴利，竟將菜價狂抬，普通蔬菜每斤售千元左右，殊屬不法，故予拘究。當日共拘得暴利菜阪一三九名，解總局偵查，視案情輕重，分別處以五百元至一千元之罰金，及拘役訓誡處分，其中三十七名拘役，八十三名罰金，一十九名訓誡。日來仍繼續調查，對不法菜販，决予以拘辦。</p>
<p>又米價黑市日益猖獗，經濟警察當局更予注意，於前日起會同軍憲至近郊漕河涇周家橋等各處，嚴密澈查，對不法米　有强行收買操縱售價者，一經查獲，定當拘究，按戰時法令嚴懲。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>讀者建議設立　「恭賀新禧助學隊」</h3>
<p>湊成兩萬元爲一隊</p>
<p>本報昨接應永玉君函云：「貴報爲搶救失學，發動「特別勸募」，讀者甚爲關心，希望超過目標，免得靑年學十失學，我想現在有個好機會，亦可說是好辦法，請貴報即日設立「恭賀新禧節約助學隊」，茲將理由及辦法略述於下：（一）理由，舊曆過年，浪費數額，頗可驚人，以全市四百萬人，每人化費一百元，即達四萬萬元，而拜年費用，在目前交通困難，車資昻貴聲中，所耗金錢及賓貴時間，尤覺可惜。廢除拜年，將節省之金錢，捐充助學金。且在近來本市天氣奇冷之時，旣省往返擠軋之時間與寒冷，同時使將失學之靑年，得有書讀，並且報上留有芳名，親友皆知，可替代賀年片及登門拜年。（二）辦法，申報自農曆初一起至初十日止，設置「恭賀新禧節約助學隊」，凡捐助助學金一千元以上一萬元以下，得成立一隊，其芳名每日均在專欄發表，目標一萬隊計至少二千萬元。永玉爲倡導促成此事之成功，特捐一千元，祈查收。（已刋前日本欄）希望各機關團體及公司工商廠號當局和高級人員，積極來參加提倡，共襄偉舉，靑年幸甚，社會幸甚！」</p>
<p>（按）應君所建議的辦法，我們覺得很有意義。不過一千元至一萬元列爲一隊，與「特別勸募」的章程不符，還是凑集兩萬元列爲一隊，比較合理。例如有十價人各捐二千元，而指定列入「恭賀新禧節的助學隊」的，我們就把它凑合起來，成爲一隊，再把捐助人台銜排列於後。這樣一來，雙方都覺得方便。而應君的建議，在事實上已發生了很大的效力。再說，本報對於籌募助學金的原則，是着重各界自由的意志，千萬不可勉强；倘使有人熱心勸募，而實行推動，那當然更爲歡迎。</p>
<p>·壓歲券·銷售報告</p>

<p>·游藝會·籌務就緒</p>
<p>籌備已久之大學生遊藝會，係大學學友進修會同人主辦，爲響應申報助學濟貧而發起，業已籌備就緒，聘請藝聲劇社公演「喜相逢」，名票友演出平劇春秋配，與影星歌唱音樂伴奏，並爲引起社會各界人士贊助起見，特出版「進修」會刊一種，公推許靜江李劍文吳傳甲陳文富王恩博呂俊民等負責編輯，將於日內發刋，內容豐富，以鼓吹助學濟貧爲前提，歡迎各界訂閱，函寄威海衛路九一〇弄六十九號。</p>

<p>八秩誕辰節約助學</p>
<p>陳君麟兆函云：「謹啓者，明日（廢歷十二月二十八日）爲家嚴八秩誕辰，親友及門，咸欲開觴慶賀，家嚴以時會多艱，堅却所請，爰節款十萬元，除捐五萬元與新聞報貸學金外，特附奉支票一紙五萬元，捐助貴報助學余。」</p>

<h3>首都的平價與維紀工作</h3>
<p>— 馬冀</p>
<p>舊歲年終將屆，首都市民正惴惴於物價的上漲，軍政當局突然以米糧自由進城爲中心，成立了一個「首都物資平價維紀委員會」，對於日常主要品的米，油，鹽，柴，魚，肉，鷄鴨等，實行平價工作。但誰都知道的，首都的日常全要物資，大部來自四鄕，近來交通器具缺乏，上項物資的進城，都用人力及獸力，城外的價格和城內的價格，往往相差至三四成之鉅。其原因不待言是沿途不良軍警的勒索。此種勒索的程度，一天加甚一天，結果小販因不堪需索，有裏足不前之勢，因而城內的物價，更一路上漲，甚至食米等來源阻塞，影響到首都六十萬人口的糧食。</p>
<p>形勢旣如此嚴重，若再聽其自然，結果必不堪設想。尤其盟鄰憲兵方面，抱絕對協助我當局推行平價工作，所以平價和維紀二項工作，自二月一日起正式開始實行。</p>
<p>平價和維紀，以七項主要日常物資而言，當然維紀較平價更爲重要。但要維紀，第一要改善軍警的待遇，「平價維紀委員會」擬定「駐首都市區軍警憲生活補助費點放規則」，此條例的特點是，第一補給費數目按照當時之生活必需價格規定之；第二，發放時由「平紀委員會」點放組派員按名照發；第三，官佐憲兵警官長，有不能工作之直系親屬者，暫定每親屬一人月給膽養費津貼一萬元，如物價再漲，尙得隨時酌予增加。</p>
<p>自恢復物資自由搬運進城辦法後，物價已有相當的回落，例如米由最高的二萬四千元回到一萬七千元，茅草由三萬二千元回跌至二萬四五千元。但民衆所擔心的，是當局維紀的决心如何，以及物價的穩定究能維持多少時期？</p>
<p>平價維紀工作自二月一日開始，到了第七天，該會軍法組查得警衛第二師通訊隊少尉排長洪宗炎，派遣所屬不時攔截勒取錢款，每一馿馱勒取國幣二三十元不等，每日約得千餘元，遂由督察隊加以逮捕，經審訊屬實，於七日下午三時在雨花台執行鎗决，其餘同犯，分別判處徒刑。雨花台上貪汚的伏法，后胡，李炎漢以後，洪宗炎是第三次了。</p>
<p>當時旣如此雷厲風行，盟邦憲兵又絕對協助，一般投機商人，當然亦不敢明目張胆的爲非作歹了。但他們的生命，根本就寄托在物價上漲上面，物價不必跌，祇要有若千時期的穩定，他們就無法維持其「經營」，因此開張未及二個月的「首都銀行」，周轉不靈，出頂大吉。此外首都五十餘家小銀行，若物價能穩定三個月，恐怕有半數要關門大吉吧。</p>
<p>關於小銀行小錢莊的非法營業，首都市民都知之甚稔。但聞此種小銀行及小錢莊，都有有力者作後盾，例如市府上次澈查銀行倉庫，而查得有囤積事實的，就是南京某銀行等數家，可知今後要根本抑平物價，有力者的兼營商業，實有澈底禁止的必要。</p>
<p>又，近來因物價的暫吿穩定，隨滬市的在升，南京方面亦鬧着黃金的狂漲。昨日飾金每兩已漲破十五關，據設尙有黑市，米柴等日用物資是否將因此刺激而跟着上升，實在不敢保證。又米柴等雖便宜了，平定了，蔬菜却有一日千里之勢，（靑菜已破三百元關）總而言之，首都的市民，和上海的市民一樣，對於生活問題，始終抱着惴惴不安之感。（七日寄）</p>

<p>上海市政　周　　　第一期</p>
<h3>今後之上海市政</h3>
<p>— 罗君强</p>
<p>上海號稱爲國際都市，實爲畸形都市。過去上海之市政，租界以外，尙未備具現代都市姿態，租界以內，政權操之外人。百年以來，受英美帝國主義者統治之結果，使上海蒙「畸形上海」「罪惡上海」種種汚名。自盟邦自倡交還租界後，上海租界，業已收回年餘。今後務使因英美帝國主義遺毒所殘留之各種不合理情形，澈底肅清，而過去各項必要的建設及技條，仍當盡力保留，適宜調整。今後的上海，必須適合中國政治體制，實行中國法令，在東亞復還於東亞之大原則下，使上海爲中國之上海。</p>
<p>上海過去社會，山於歷史因素所造成之結果，重外力而無國家觀念，認金錢而不講公理，恃權勢而無法律，謀私利而不顧公益，此種風氣，亟應澈底革除。今後不問任何不良勢力，不計任何利害，亳不顧慮，掃除過去惡習，逐漸造成大上海之淸新風氣。</p>
<p>上海爲我國最大都市，在政治上爲中國之縮影，在經濟上爲中國之心藏，在文化上亦有其重要地位。尤以當此決戰時期，爲完遂戰爭，應盡力使上海市政，與客觀條件配合。維持市民正當之權益，減少市民不必要之痛苦。希望上海市民，不分國籍，不分階級，與市府當局開誠合作，以其謀上海市政之合理合法的改進與發展也。</p>
<h3>市府機構述要（一）</h3>
<p>— 廷玉</p>
<p>上海特別市政府，從去年八月一日以後，始具機構統一的形式。就現在市府組織概况而論（請參香第一表），有九局，四處，一館，七個縣政府，六個區公署，兩個委員會。參事雖非有機體的組織，（其他各局處會館等皆能單獨對外行文，參事祗是襄助市長秘書長處理市政，不能對外行有感文），但是在組織系統上下屬於任何局處，所以也算一個單位。</p>
<p>現在上海市政府在組織上，有兩個特點：第一點：現在上海市，旣有市區，又有郊區，縣區，它的範圍，似乎介乎省與市之間。照市組織法的規定，市府一切行政，直接由各局處對市民辦理，沒有區公署和縣政府的；現在上海市的制度，局外有區，有縣，是兩重行政制。但是此一特點，基於財政與治安的見地上，還不能加以變更。第二點：現在上海市府組織龐大，在其他各省市一個機關所主管的事務，在上海分兩三個機關分辦：譬如物品配給處所主管的事務，在各省市屬於經濟局；榮主不在土地房屋管理委員會所主管的事務，各省市或屬財政廳局或屬地政局。然而此種事實，當然是爲了上海人口衆多或其他特殊性而成立的。</p>
<p>所謂市政府，是包括所屬各機關的總稱。市長是市政府的最高長官，他指揮監督所有的機關。而市政府秘書處便是全市政府的神經中樞，它乘承市長的命令，作指揮監督各附屬機關的實際的和技術性的統合性的工作。</p>
<p>本文爲簡單明瞭計，側重表解方法。第一表是全市府的組織系統，然後陸續刋載各附屬機關的細胞組織及其管轄事務。其次序先局後處，然後各委員會。所有各機關表解時，凡以數字排列的部門，如第一科第二科者，必註明它的職掌範圍。凡職務已經標明，如總務科調查科者，不再註明。</p>

<h3>物價問題座談會（上）</h3>
<p>本市物價問題，雖極複雜，但在管理方面，我們認爲始終未盡合理。自新經濟局長許葆庭先生接任後，亟圖調整，本報爲集思廣益計，特邀請許局長，及經濟界船津辰一郞，陳日平，何堪，姚慶三，項康原，李祖慮諸先生，舉行物價問題座談會，由本報陳社長主持，茲將座談經過，記錄於次：</p>
<p>本報陳社長　目前物價高漲，不論對於國家社會，對於民衆生活都有極大的影響，敝報爲此邀請經濟局許局長和諸君，希望對於當前經濟上各項重要問題，各抒高見，以許局長爲中心，詳爲討論。今天討論的中心有四個：</p>
<p>評定物價的標準，應當如何決定。過去政府儘管限價，而黑市依舊存在，政府評定的價格與實際的價格，完全脫籲。一方面固然是工商界缺乏遵守法令的精神，另方面也因爲物價的評定，亳無依據，不能顧到生產成本，以致事實上想遵守法令也有所困難。所以用何種方式來評定物價，應當按照什麼標準評定物價，都是値得研究的問題。</p>
<p>處置黑市的辦法。物價旣經評定，便應絕對堅持，黑市應當絕對消減，所以如何處置黑市，是今天要討論的第二個問題。</p>
<p>評定物價，消滅黑市，非管理物資不爲功，滯則，便無法阻止業內的居奇，業外的囤積，依然不能控制物價上昇的趨勢，結果是評價跟着物價跑。此外，應如何增產，應統盤籌劃，其先決條件，也是管理物資。所以今天要討論的第三個問題，就是怎樣管理物資。</p>
<p>過去物價的上昇，外間嘖有煩言。現在經濟局調整人事，充實內部，今後必能一新耳目，滿足市民的期望；對於同業公會方面，首應加以强化，其性質相似者，尤應合併，减少單位，增厚力量，使整個上海市的經濟機構，臻於健全之路，這是第四個需要討論的問題。</p>
<p>現在先請許先生對於經濟局過去的工作，以及未來的方針，發表高見。</p>
<p>許江　　物價評定標準：關於生產力直，本市物價略可分爲農爲品。工業原料。工業製成品等三種：（一）農產品係從調查產地價格及運輸收買情形，訂定適當價格，不使隨時變動。（二）工業原料將市區現有存貨，先行登記，限制買賣，以免業外人操縱，影響工業成本。（三）工業製成品，其原料價格已先穏定，再就工廠成本利潤各項加以調整，則訂定價格，不致漫無標準。</p>
<p>關認管理方面，本市物價評議會現正改組機構，加强評價力量，並對於同業公會之訂價，愼密督導，務期物價一經評定，即可發生效能，而使黑市無形消滅。</p>
<p>處置黑市辦法：近來本市物價高最，造因甚複雜，不消商人之利用一種黑市，使民間買賣非此無從交易，有礙國家政令，增重人民負担，殊堪痛恨。本局現已加强評價力量，使評價之效力與物資之供求，可以相當，無須和黑市之機會。倘不法之徒操縱黑市有據者，更嚴厲制裁之，使黑市之風，無形消滅。</p>
<p>管理物資方法：一，普遍辦理工商用電登記，以期管理一致，增益生產效能。二，函各水電公司，查復現在用電工廠，是否合法，重加審定。三，迅速辦理主要商品登記，以免商人居奇操從。登記方法，以依式塡列分類記載簿爲根據。登記完畢，由本局擬具辦法，呈候核定執行。至其他統制之物品，亦請有關機關按月將登記數量，函送本局查考。四，未經登記之主要商品，加遇有聲請移動證明書時，不予受理，以免業外人乘機囤積操縱等流弊。</p>
<p>同業公會之整理：依據民國三十二年公布之工商業同業公會暫行條例，原以同業公會之機構，協助政府質施新經濟政策，兼謀各業之發展，生產之增高，以應戰時需要。但同業公會本身之良窳，影響施新經濟政策之前途甚重。本市二百餘同來公會，其中歷史悠久，組織健全國居多數，或因人選不當，組織重複，須加調整者，亦屬不少。前者更當增强其力量，後者亟應整頓，以臻健全，而免妨碍同業之福利，阻滯經濟政策推進。例如組織類似重複者，分別予以合併，俾符名實；提高理事長職權，推選正直者充任，俾有助於政令之推進，使商情之動向，悉納於正軌。於是勸吿登記，防止囤積，抑平物價，增加生產諸工作，可收合作之效。而適應現在之城要。這是本局最近整理同業公會的使命。</p>
<p>保堪　（一）物價評定標準　（甲）由外埠運來之物資，須注意下列各項：　生產成本，　當地批價，　運逾費用，　沿途耗損，　貯藏耗損，　沿途正當及不正當之捐稅，　資本利息，　批發利益（不得過以上七項綜合數百分之二十），　經售商利潤（不得過以上八項綜合數百分之三十）。最好由熱心公益之名流。親往採辦地點，試辦一批貨物，庶幾評價時不受商人欺騙。</p>
<p>（乙）舶來品囤積於商人手中，須注意以下各項：　事變前之原價，以普通生活指數乘之，不得因缺貨而加以高抬。　商人由囤貨者購買時之價格須合理，其不合理者嚴責囤戶歸還浮收之價款。其定價仍以　項爲標準。　經售商利潤，不得過上項成本百分之三十，高抬價格者處重刑</p>
<p>（丙）本市內製成之物品：　原料價値（由外埠輸入者依甲項計算舶來者依（乙）項計算），　原動力消耗，　管理費及工資，　貯藏費及消耗，　運輸費，　資本利息，　廠家利益，不得過全部開支百分之二十，　經售商利益，不得過進價百分之三十。</p>

<h3>The Japanese are Constructing Strong Fortifications Around the Pasig River Area in Henan Province; Fierce Artillery Battles are Unfolding in Northern Manila</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to dispatches from Luzon, the defending forces in Manila, since the 3rd, have been ambushing enemy troops invading the city in key areas of the northern districts, inflicting heavy casualties. On the 7th at 1:00 PM, they transferred their positions to behind the Pasig River. Subsequently, they launched fierce attacks on enemy tanks and infantry units advancing in the southern area of the Pasig River, successfully preventing their advance and inflicting heavy damage. Furthermore, in just three days from the 3rd to the 5th, local battles in the northern part of the city alone resulted in over 500 enemy soldiers killed, and several enemy cannons and over 20 armored vehicles destroyed. They are also bravely fighting against enemy troops attempting to invade southern Manila from the Nichols Field airfield. Although the enemy has suffered heavy losses from the Japanese forces' severe attacks, they stubbornly attempt to cut off the main Japanese forces holding the high ground east of Manila, with the aim of severing communication with the Japanese troops within the city. On the evening of the 5th, the enemy gathered an assault force, mainly composed of tanks, in Kosu City, approximately 15 kilometers north of Manila, and adopted a strategy of making a large detour south from eastern Manila. The Japanese forces are currently fiercely attacking the enemy in that area, striving to thwart their southward attempt.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reports from the Luzon front, Japanese forces are constructing strong fortifications in the central southern part of the Pasig River, ambushing American advances. They are also engaged in fierce artillery battles with American forces in northern Manila. On the night of the 5th, a large fire broke out in the most prosperous streets of Manila due to American bombing and artillery fire, lasting for two days and three nights. As a result, Manila's largest department stores, theaters, banks, and hotels were completely reduced to ashes, and half of Chinatown was also destroyed. American military operations seem to have been further hampered by the fire and fierce Japanese counterattacks. At the same time, Japanese forces in the highlands of the Bataan Peninsula are building fortifications in the mountains, engaging in intense jungle warfare with units of the American 38th Division.</p>
<p>Prosperous City Streets Turned into a Sea of Fire</p>
<p>Wandi, Luzon Front, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A portion of the enemy forces that invaded northern Manila on the afternoon of the 3rd had, by the 7th, formed a full-scale offensive against the central and southern areas of Manila. A comprehensive summary of the battle situation in the northern Manila area from the 2nd to the 7th is as follows: The enemy's 1st Cavalry Division, advancing southwest from the Bataan side, reached east of Marcos on the 3rd. On the same evening, a portion of them reached the northern end of Manila City. The enemy used guerrilla cars and armored vehicle teams to bypass gaps in the Japanese defenses, and at around 5:00 PM, broke into the northern part of Manila City, invading the southern reception center of Santo Tomas University. Around 10:00 PM, the Japanese forces defending Manila destroyed the Pasig River bridgehead and some military facilities according to plan. On the same day, the enemy also broke into the vicinity of Santo Tomas University late at night. Moreover, security within the city is excellent, and public order has been restored very quickly. Since the evening of the 4th, the enemy's 1st Cavalry Division and the 37th Infantry Regiment, together with Philippine bandits, have invaded the northern side of Manila City. The enemy force originally had 170 tanks, 500 cars, and four artillery pieces, with other vehicles totaling approximately 1,500 and personnel exceeding 1,300. In response, the Japanese army and navy, in mutual cooperation, have been engaging in fierce street battles in the eastern and northern parts of the city for days, with the area between the Central Station and Malacañang Palace being the most intense. During the three days and nights, Japanese commando units broke into the enemy-held Presidential Palace, destroying two enemy tanks and killing over 50 enemy soldiers. During the street battles, the enemy used incendiary bombs, and the most prosperous Rizal Avenue and Escolta Street areas of Manila were surrounded by raging fires for days. The Japanese forces bravely fought to the death, holding their positions amidst the fierce fires, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Therefore, the battle within Manila City continues between the two armies in the area north of the Pasig River, while important areas of Manila on the southern island are still secured by the Japanese garrison. Since the 6th, the Japanese forces have been shelling the southern island area, and at the same time, a portion of the enemy forces and bandits attacked Nichols Field airfield on the southern outskirts of Manila. The Japanese forces in that area seem to have continued to pressure the enemy forces to the south on the 6th. Because the enemy forces have recently gathered two or three divisions of troops in the surrounding areas of Manila, attempting to launch a full-scale attack, the street fighting within Manila City may become even more intense. Currently, the Japanese forces are inflicting great damage on the enemy and fighting bravely.</p>
<p>The Decisive Battle Has Only Just Begun</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy Americans are making a big publicity push based on the invasion of Manila, implying that the Philippine campaign is about to end. However, the Japanese forces are still deploying tightly on Luzon Island, so the real decisive battle is yet to come. Even the American leaders fabricating the propaganda must frankly admit this. Former American Resident Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, broadcast that even if Manila is occupied, strong Japanese forces are still deployed on Luzon Island. Unless these Japanese forces are defeated, it cannot be considered that the Philippine campaign has ended. Furthermore, former Ambassador to Japan and current Under Secretary of State, Grew, stated that the fall of Manila can only be considered the beginning of the Japanese-American decisive battle. It would be a big mistake to think that this means the end of the Philippine campaign.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military's Potential Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Detroit, US Under Secretary of the Navy, Forrestal, gave a speech in Detroit on the 7th, saying that although the US military has made progress in several places in the Pacific today, the Japanese military still has powerful forces and well-equipped elite troops. Moreover, the production of Japanese aircraft and weaponry is gradually increasing, and the Japanese military also has a large number of reserve forces. They all have the determination to fight the US military and win. Frankly speaking, the current war situation can only be said to be the beginning of the US military's formal test of the Japanese military's defense capabilities. The closer we get to Tokyo, the more fortified the defenses of the Japanese army and navy will be. In the Philippine Islands, the Japanese military has built many airfields in the past two or three years. The US military has suffered considerable losses in past air battles, and its losses will inevitably increase as it advances into the Pacific in the future. We must now pay attention to the possibility that the Japanese military will use rocket bombs and jet-propelled aircraft.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Japanese Military's New Strategy: The Japan Navy Becomes an Air Force</h3>
<p>The joint press conference hosted by the three authorities of the Allied Japan Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs in Shanghai was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Press Department, Lieutenant Matsumoto, Trustee Lin Junfu, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Vice Consul Fukuoka, etc. were present. Minister Matsushima delivered a speech clarifying the evolution of the Philippine battle situation. In the operations on the Philippine Islands, the Japanese military adopted a new strategy, giving the enemy Americans the greatest attrition and annihilating them, as well as various difficulties suffered by the enemy Americans in terms of manpower and supply in the Pacific. The speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Military Operations Cause Enemy Attrition</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the Philippines, fierce street fighting is currently underway in Manila. The Japanese military has consistently inflicted the greatest sacrifices and the greatest attrition on the enemy forces. Although the enemy American commander, MacArthur, announced that Manila has fallen and that Luzon Island is under his control, the whereabouts of the Japanese military units led by General Yamashita and the naval units led by General Okawauchi are a matter of operational secrecy and cannot be disclosed to the enemy. The Japanese operational method is to avoid a major decisive battle and instead cause the enemy Americans to suffer large-scale attrition, and within the realm of possibility, to lure the American forces to gather in the Luzon Island area and annihilate them. In order to prepare for combat capabilities, they obstruct the enemy's offensive. Therefore, Generals Yamashita and Okawauchi have deployed their tactics. In the past, in the Leyte Island area, they tied down at least ten enemy divisions. The American forces currently tied down in the Manila area are several times greater than those in Leyte Island.</p>
<p>Great Battle Results are About to Appear</p>
<p>Even if Luzon Island falls, because of the Japanese military's change in operational methods, the losses suffered by Luzon will be extremely limited. The significance of the Japanese protection of Luzon Island lies in maintaining the supply routes to the Japanese mainland and the south. If Luzon Island falls, it may appear that the supply from the south to Japan will be affected, but now the Japanese military is changing its strategy, abandoning the past strategy of protecting Luzon to maintain resources from the south and adopting a new strategy. The so-called new strategy will make aircraft the primary focus, annihilating the enemy on the unique terrain of the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland, and on an extremely narrow and flooded sea. Especially in terms of Sino-Japanese cooperation, this strategy is of great significance. The most prominent phenomenon of making aircraft the primary focus is the Japan Navy becoming an Air Force. Since the advent of aircraft more than thirty years ago, Japan has regarded warships as the main force and aircraft as the auxiliary force. In the past operations in Malaya and Hawaii, the heavy damage inflicted on the enemy was due to this allocation. Now that Japan is adopting a new strategy and using aircraft as the main force, it is not because of a lack of warships or because the power of warships is not as good as the power of aircraft. This has been demonstrated in the Hawaii battle, and can be clearly stated. Now that the operational method has changed, in future major naval and air operations, the situation of fleets being dispatched as in the past will not be easily realized unless absolutely necessary. At this moment, before the power of the Japanese air force has surfaced and the extreme effects have appeared, all kinds of situations are temporarily suspended. I believe that astonishing effects will soon be demonstrated.</p>
<p>The Enemy Americans Are Feeling Even Greater Difficulties with Manpower</p>
<p>Secondly, the weakness of the American military is the lack of human resources. In the Leyte Island operation, twenty American divisions were tied down. In the future, on the mainland or in areas close to the Japanese mainland, the United States will certainly feel even greater difficulties with human resources. The second is the problem of replenishing weapons and fuel. Because the transportation route is too long, like the same situation after the Allied German forces attacked Stalingrad, the enemy Americans will soon encounter extreme difficulties in this regard.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Schemes Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Spread Rumors</p>
<p>Recently, many rumors have sprung up in Shanghai. Recently, when someone saw Japanese soldiers wearing leather hats, they took the opportunity to spread rumors. This is just a troop movement. In such a vast China, what is so strange about moving troops wearing leather hats from the north? There is also an incredible rumor that in order to protect the safety of Shanghai, it is hoped that the Japanese troops in Shanghai will withdraw, making Shanghai a demilitarized city. This is a temptation from the enemy and communist party tactics. If we take the view of Sino-Japanese cooperation, shared life, and shared death, this kind of rumor will never occur. Japanese, whether officers or civilians, are fighting together, willing to be completely annihilated if necessary, in order to prevent the British and Americans from invading China. If Chinese intellectuals can understand the psychology of the Japanese, then this kind of rumor will naturally disappear. In the Greater East Asia War, Japan is not focused on local victories or defeats. Its greatest policy is to protect the safety of the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland, and to make the enemy Americans bleed and lose as much as possible.</p>
<h3>B-29 Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Saigon; French and Vietnamese People Express Anger</h3>
<p>Saigon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 7th, B-29 aircraft indiscriminately bombed Saigon, causing considerable damage to buildings and civilian houses, as well as many casualties. According to the local French government authorities, they announced at 7:00 PM that afternoon that American heavy bombers had invaded the Saigon riverside area at noon on the 7th, causing damage to hospitals and residences. Because this was indiscriminate bombing of the residential center of the city, the French and local residents were greatly affected. The enemy has repeatedly claimed that it will not kill French and Annamese people, but now its brutal face has been completely revealed. In particular, many people in hospitals were sacrificed due to indiscriminate bombing. French military officers and civilians have expressed extreme anger at this inhumane behavior.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Submarines Sunk in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air units have sunk two enemy submarines in the Southwest Pacific in the past few days.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Battle of Manila</h3>
<p>With Manila as the center, the Philippine war has become more intense in the past few days.</p>
<p>When the enemy Americans landed in the Lingayen area last time, they intended to capture Manila in one fell swoop within a week or ten days. However, due to the fierce resistance of the powerful Japanese military using attrition tactics, the enemy suffered heavy losses and ultimately failed to achieve their wish.</p>
<p>From the end of January to the beginning of February, the enemy's offensive intensified. At the same time, the Japanese military strategically withdrew slightly in some areas after completing its strategic mission, and the war began to approach Manila. The enemy Americans are adopting a semi-circular offensive against Manila. The main force crossed the central plain of Luzon from Lingayen, went south through the San Fernando area, and attacked north of Manila. In the southwest, they attacked from Subic Bay northwest of Manila and north from the Bataan Peninsula southeast of Manila Bay, echoing the southward force. On February 3, American troops advancing south from San Fernando first broke into the northern area of Manila and launched fierce battles.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the enemy American forces invading Luzon Island and attacking Manila currently amount to more than eleven divisions. About eight of these divisions came from Lingayen Bay in succession, about two divisions newly landed from Subic Bay northwest of Manila at the end of January, and another part belonged to the troops landing at Nasugbu southwest of Manila Bay. The distribution of these forces is roughly two divisions each in Lingayen and the highlands northeast of Clark Field, two divisions in the Manila area, two divisions in the Subic area, and two divisions in the Nasugbu area, concentrated in the west-central-south parts of Luzon Island, forming the so-called semi-circular offensive against Manila.</p>
<p>Outside Luzon Island, the Japanese military in Leyte and other islands still maintains powerful combat forces. In order to contain the Japanese military, the enemy Americans have also been conducting invasive operations against the central and southern islands of the Philippines recently. From mid-January, the enemy forces also carried out landing operations in the southern Sulu Islands (northeast of North Borneo). They have also been constantly harassing the waters around Cebu Island in the central part. There have also been landings on Bohol Island between Leyte Island and Cebu Island, all of which have suffered heavy blows from the Japanese military's counterattacks. Furthermore, in the Palembang area of Sumatra, enemy British mobile units have recently invaded from time to time in response to the enemy American operations in the Philippines, but after the Japanese military's counterattacks, the enemy British have suffered losses and gained nothing.</p>
<p>The reason why the enemy Americans are so urgently trying to capture Manila is because they have their own wishful thinking.</p>
<p>First, the enemy Americans are attempting, and subjectively believe, that after occupying Manila, they can settle Luzon Island and thereby resolve the Philippine war. In fact, there are still a large number of elite Japanese troops scattered throughout the Philippine Islands. Given the large number of Philippine islands and the complexity of the terrain, it is extremely difficult for the enemy Americans to rest easy on the Philippine Islands. Moreover, Manila currently has little strategic value, and the gain or loss of this place is of little importance.</p>
<p>Second, the enemy Americans also plan that after making progress in the Philippines, they will use the islands of Luzon as bases, establish air force bases and naval supply stations, and then harass Taiwan and the Chinese coast, and expand their air guerrilla warfare, including the Japanese mainland. This plan is also bound to fail. On the one hand, as mentioned above, the Japanese military on the Philippine Islands can still contain them in the future. On the other hand, the powerful Japanese naval forces, which do not move easily, are waiting to annihilate the enemy. If the enemy Americans advance further, they will undoubtedly suffer even more severe blows than they suffered in the Taiwan Sea in the past. Moreover, since the Yuehan Railway has been opened and the defense of the Chinese coast has been strengthened, the enemy American's delusion of landing is obviously more hindered.</p>
<p>Third, the enemy Americans also want to occupy Manila as the basis for their propaganda offensive. Manila is the capital of the Philippines (the Philippine government has now moved its capital to northern Luzon Island). By occupying Manila, they want to create the distorted impression in the minds of the general public that the United States has conquered the Philippines, and use this to engage in various propaganda with delusional grandiosity. This is also futile. As long as the Japanese military can still stand and operate on the islands, this propaganda will be ineffective.</p>
<p>In short, the gain or loss of Manila in one place will definitely not immediately determine the Philippine war, let alone affect the entire Greater East Asia War situation. However, we cannot ignore the seriousness of the situation, and we must respond to the severe situation more carefully, and cooperate more actively in the war, overcome difficulties, destroy all the delusions of the enemy Americans, and regain the freedom of the East Asian people and the freedom of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military Wins Victories Near Bhamo, Burma; Enemy Aircraft Attacking the Nankan Bridge Shot Down Eight Aircraft</h3>
<p>Northern Burma Front, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The newly formed 22nd Division and part of the 50th Division of the 6th Army of the Nationalist Chinese Army, which are gradually moving south along the Mengduo Highway near the Bhamo area, have been fiercely attacked by the Japanese garrison in Bhamo, suffering devastating blows, losing contact with the 6th Army, and falling into complete chaos, forcing them to suspend their actions. Until recently, when they independently advanced south again, several hundred Nationalist Chinese troops attacked near Menglong (25 kilometers north of Mengmit) at dawn on January 28. After two successive courageous assaults by the Japanese military, they were routed, abandoning many corpses and prisoners. Also on that day, in the evening, several hundred Nationalist Chinese troops with many mortars and machine guns on a hill 200 meters east of Menglong launched an offensive against the Japanese front lines, but suffered heavy losses and retreated north.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base on the Burmese Front, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In response to the attacks from Ruili and Namhkam, the enemy air force has repeatedly spied on the rear of the Japanese military. On the 29th, a total of 38 enemy aircraft attacked the Nankan Bridge (34 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital) on the Burma Road between Lashio and Ruili, bombing or strafing it. After the Japanese military's air defense units in that area shot down eight of them and inflicted some damage, they fled.</p>
<h3>Solid Alcoholic Beverages Successfully Manufactured</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Great Japan Beer Science Research Institute, which had long been inconvenienced by the transportation of liquid alcoholic beverages such as beer, whiskey, and sake, has been researching the solidification of alcoholic beverages. It has recently achieved success, meaning that the whiskey, beer, etc. that were previously consumed can now be transformed into edible solid food. The production content is roughly as follows: (1) "Solid Alcohol": This is a solid alcohol successfully produced by the Osaka Factory. It is made by adding succinic acid to glucose, which becomes edible Japanese sake and whiskey. It is extremely convenient to send to the front lines, and the taste is extremely sweet, making it especially suitable for aircrew and submariners. (2) "Instant Beer Essence": This beer essence is sent to the battlefield, where it is dissolved locally to become liquid beer essence, with the aim of allowing the soldiers on the front lines to satisfy their desire for alcohol. The essence is made using sugar water pulp and hops, with a small amount of yeast added. Shaped like small milk candy cubes, these beer essence cubes are dissolved in carbonated water to become beer, which can be freely used within 24 hours. This was successfully manufactured by the Tokyo Factory.</p>
<h3>Nelson Manipulates Nationalist Chinese Military Supplies Production</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai News) According to a youth who arrived here from Chongqing, the United States sent Nelson to promote Nationalist Chinese military supplies production in August of last year. After the establishment of the Military Supplies Production Bureau, new factories were established in Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and other northwest areas. Nelson sent Americans to serve as consultants in these factories, numbering as many as 34. As a result, the factories were all manipulated by Americans. Even Weng Wenhao, the director of the wartime production bureau, was only in name. In reality, he was controlled by the American consultants, which Chiang Kai-shek was extremely dissatisfied with. Recently, the highway from India to Chongqing has been opened. In order to grasp the actual power of the highway, Chongqing intended to name it "Chiang Kai-shek Highway", but the United States opposed it, naming it "Stilwell Road". After repeated discussions, it was decided to name it "Stilwell Road", and the director of the management bureau was also an American. The Chongqing authorities showed no objection on the surface, but were actually not very satisfied. As a result, the United States only sent black people to work on the highway for transportation.</p>
<h3>Reduced US Production</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai. According to reliable sources, the wartime boom in the United States has deteriorated since October of last year, and the production of military supplies has also gradually decreased. Statistics show that in November of last year, its military production had already decreased to 60%. Although the Washington authorities have since tried their best to restore production, up to now, not only has it not been realized, but various defects have occurred in social life. According to recent news: the shortage of coal and food in the United States is extremely serious. On January 26 of this year, the Washington authorities ordered the rationing of coal to all public places in the country to be stopped in thirty-nine states (the rationing of coal to the people had already stopped). On February 1, they again ordered a 50% reduction in all electricity consumption. The next day, they stopped the use of railways to transport civilian supplies for four days in five eastern states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. In New York, passenger car operations were also stopped, and at the same time, strict administrative measures were announced to prevent public riots. According to the explanation of the government authorities, this panic is entirely due to the shortage of coal and manpower in the country. It is said that the production of coal in the United States has been reduced by 10 million tons per month since December of last year, and the labor force in military factories has also decreased by 700,000 people, resulting in the above-mentioned results. It is also learned that the production of US military supplies is now greatly reduced compared to before, especially in the production of weapons such as airplanes, tanks, rubber tires, and meteor bombs, which are particularly hindered.</p>
<h3>Special Compilation of Survey by the Statistics Bureau of the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th. Since its establishment last year, the Statistics Bureau of the National Economic Commission has launched a general survey of the economic situation. The Bureau plans to compile a special publication in the near future on the various survey statistics obtained over the years, for the reference of all relevant parties, and is now actively compiling it.</p>
<h3>Minister of the Navy Ling Hai Published His Views on the Current War Situation: The Enemy's American Invasion is a Major Strategic Error</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Minister of the Navy, Mr. Ling, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday on official business and is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for several days to pay his first visits to various sectors of the city after taking office and to inspect the various Shanghai-based agencies of the Ministry of the Navy. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited Minister Ling at his private residence yesterday to inquire about his views on the current war situation and the general situation of the Chinese Navy. The following is a transcript of his remarks:</p>
<p>Modern Warfare: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the brave soldiers of friendly nations have resisted the enemy for three years, and their brilliant achievements have amazed people all over the world. This spirit of serving the country with loyalty, perseverance, and excellence is truly admirable. The enemy, Britain and the United States, have suffered heavy losses after this long-term attack and cannot recover without several years of preparation. Moreover, the military supplies needed at present are becoming increasingly scarce, and the difficulties in their supply and the reduction in production are enough to make them exhausted in coping with the war. Now the enemy is taking a great strategic taboo, trekking long distances across the ocean, and deeply invading the hinterland of East Asia, which is a major mistake. Moreover, the current war is not about the gains and losses of a place or a city, but about how to consume the enemy's war power. Therefore, although the Pacific islands have been luckily occupied by them, from a military point of view, they have no significant value. Although Manila has now been invaded by the enemy, the surrounding friendly naval and land forces have adopted an ambush posture to make the enemy bleed heavily, which is the so-called "bleeding tactic." According to my observation, in modern warfare, airplanes are more important than warships. The production of friendly airplanes is increasing day by day, and the naval combat troops have a strong air force, making their formation even stronger. Moreover, the enemy's supply lines are long and distant, while our supply bases are close at hand, which is also an advantageous position for us.</p>
<p>Our Navy: When the National Government returned to the capital, friendly nations returned the coastal bases to our country based on morality and helped cultivate the navy. Over the years, the navy has gone from the embryonic stage to the new stage. The headquarters has actively trained naval personnel in these years. Although the current strength is not enough to directly attack the enemy, with the cooperation of friendly nations, the national naval defense mission has been undertaken by our navy, and all officers and soldiers have the ambition to kill the enemy. In the current situation, when the enemy is exhausted, it is still impossible to invade the country as an isolated army. If the enemy takes risks and turns dreams into reality and invades our coastline, then our well-trained and battle-ready navy will have the opportunity to give the enemy a head-on blow.</p>
<p>Today's Tea Party: Mr. Ling visited Mayor Zhou at 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Commander-in-Chief of the Friendly Naval Fleet in China, General Kondo, Commander of the Shanghai Naval Landing Force, the Naval Attache Office, and the Shanghai Base Headquarters, making his first visits after taking office. He was invited to a banquet by General Kondo in the evening. It is also scheduled to hold a tea party at the Shuijiaoshe at 4:00 p.m. today (10th) to entertain Chinese and foreign guests from all walks of life in the city to enhance friendship.</p>

<h3>Economic Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Price Gouging of Vegetables; Joint Military and Police Investigation of Rice Price Hike</h3>
<p>The economic police authorities of this city believe that recently, as the end of the year approaches, some illegal merchants disregard laws and regulations and take the opportunity to stir up trouble and raise prices, resulting in increasingly rampant inflation and serious threats to people's livelihoods. Therefore, starting on the 7th of this month, all economic police were dispatched to conduct a comprehensive investigation of prices and to detain profiteers. On the 7th, various detachments found in their respective districts that some vegetable vendors were seeking exorbitant profits and had raised vegetable prices wildly, with ordinary vegetables selling for about 1,000 yuan per catty, which was illegal, so they were detained for investigation. A total of 139 vegetable vendors who made exorbitant profits were detained that day and sent to the General Bureau for investigation. Depending on the severity of the case, they were fined 500 to 1,000 yuan, and given detention and reprimand. Among them, 37 were detained, 83 were fined, and 19 were reprimanded. The investigation continues to this day, and illegal vegetable vendors will be detained.</p>
<p>Moreover, the black market for rice prices is becoming increasingly rampant, and the economic police authorities are paying more attention to it. Starting the day before yesterday, they joined forces with the military and police to conduct a thorough investigation in the suburbs such as Caohejing and Zhoujiaqiao. Those who forcibly buy and manipulate the price of illegal rice will be detained and severely punished in accordance with wartime laws.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Air Defense Day Implementation of Alarm Communication Training, Comprehensive Exercises Held Separately in Each District</h3>
<p>Yesterday (9th) was the 14th Air Defense Day. The air defense authorities carried out various air defense training exercises as usual. However, in addition to district training and comprehensive training, this session also carried out alarm communication training without prior notice. The Air Defense Section of the Second Division of the Municipal Police Department dispatched special commissioners to inspect and guide the exercises. The entire day was in a state of air defense, and the atmosphere was very tense. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Implementation of Alarm Communication Training</p>
<p>The scheduled alarm training started at 8:00 a.m. The alert alarm was issued at 9:00 a.m. The air raid alarm was issued at 10:00 a.m. The alert alarm was issued again at 11:00 a.m. The alert alarm was completely lifted. The designated training alarm was not sounded with a siren. The unscheduled training alarm started at 2:00 p.m., which was the air raid alarm, and was lifted at 2:30 p.m. At 3:30 p.m., the text was changed to training air raid alarm, and at 4:00 p.m., it was practiced entering the training alert alarm, and at 5:00 p.m., the training alert alarm was lifted. From 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., training alarms were also carried out. This training alarm was not sounded with a siren, nor was it scheduled in advance. It was decided temporarily by the Air Defense Command, which ordered the citizens' air defense headquarters, which then used the quickest method to order the various branches, telephone companies, water and electricity companies, and other transportation agencies to implement various emergency measures. Then, the second section of each branch ordered the Baojia head police and air defense personnel in their respective districts to implement major training exercises such as traffic control and lighting control. The lighting control was the strictest. Each district was formed by police officers and Baojia personnel to form a lighting control team to patrol each district. Those who leaked light and violated the rules were punished by sealing the electricity.</p>
<p>Three Districts Implemented Local Training</p>
<p>This session implemented the second local general staff training, which was jointly implemented by Taishan, Lujiawan, and Changshu districts. The areas under the jurisdiction of the three branches were bounded by Taishan Road. Training was conducted in the northern district from 10:00 a.m. and in the southern district from 11:00 a.m. A small number of citizens and all alarm personnel in the three districts participated, and the heads of the respective branches, Shi Enjian, Yu Dengyun, and Xu Dong, together with the directors of the second section of each branch, served as commanders. At the beginning of the training, it was assumed that a large squadron of enemy planes was attacking and indiscriminately bombing the area. Houses collapsed, and then smoke and flames rose everywhere. Residents and pedestrians fell to the ground injured. Air defense personnel immediately carried out security, firefighting, and rescue work, and directed the public to take refuge. Observers and communicators reported the assumed bombing situation at any time, and the performance was quite realistic. Other districts separately implemented comprehensive training exercises, including 7 in Huangpu District, 9 in Xincheng District, 5 in Laoza District, 3 in Jing'an Temple District, 8 in Jiangning District, 7 in Hongkou District, 2 in West Hongkou District, 6 in North Sichuan Road District, 7 in Tilanqiao District, 2 in Yulin Road District, 2 in Yangshupu District, 18 in Taishan District, 2 in Lujiawan District, 16 in Changshu District, 3 in Huashan Road District, 2 in Changning District, 3 in Yimiao District, 1 in Penglai Road District, 3 in Xieqiao District, 7 in Xujiahui District, 7 in Zhabei District, and 2 in Dongchang Road District. The heads of the respective branches directed the implementation of various major training exercises such as taking refuge, rescue, and fire fighting. The training on taking refuge was the most arbitrary. All shelters were marked with clear signs. During the training, citizens went to the shelters, and the results were very skilled.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo Visited the Training</p>
<p>The Xincheng Police Branch specially convened its air defense staff and held a comprehensive training exercise near Jiading Road and Xinzha Road at 8:00 a.m. Those who came to inspect the site included Secretary-General Luo, representing Director Zhou, Deputy Director Du, and the head of the Husi Gendarmerie of the friendly nation. Branch Director Li Guohua personally came to the site to command. After the inspection, Secretary-General Luo gave instructions and expressed satisfaction with the air defense training in the district. Later, Branch Director Li gave a speech, in addition to encouraging the members, he also pointed out the various shortcomings. It is heard that the results of this training were very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3>Reader Suggestions for Establishing a "Happy New Year Scholarship Assistance Team"</h3>
<p>Raise Twenty Thousand Yuan Per Team</p>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Ying Yongyu, stating: "Your newspaper's 'Special Fundraising' to rescue students from dropping out has received much attention from readers, who hope it will exceed its target, so that young students will not have to abandon their studies. I think there is a good opportunity now, or rather, a good method. Please establish a 'Happy New Year Frugality Scholarship Assistance Team' immediately. The reasons and methods are briefly described below: (1) Reasons: The amount of waste during the Lunar New Year is quite staggering. With a city of four million people, if each person spends one hundred yuan, that amounts to four hundred million yuan. Moreover, in the current circumstances of difficult transportation and expensive fares, the money spent on New Year visits, as well as the valuable time, is particularly regrettable. Abolish New Year visits and donate the money saved to scholarship funds. Moreover, in the recent unusually cold weather in our city, this saves time and discomfort from travel, while allowing young people who are about to drop out to continue their studies. Furthermore, their names will be listed in the newspaper, known to all friends and relatives, which can replace New Year cards and door-to-door visits. (2) Methods: From the first to the tenth day of the lunar calendar, the Shen Bao will establish a 'Happy New Year Frugality Scholarship Assistance Team.' Anyone who donates between one thousand and ten thousand yuan to the scholarship fund can form a team. Their names will be published in a special column every day. The target is ten thousand teams, totaling at least twenty million yuan. Ying Yongyu is donating one thousand yuan to promote and facilitate the success of this endeavor. Please accept it. (Previously published in the Japan column.) It is hoped that various institutions, organizations, companies, industrial and commercial factories, and senior personnel will actively participate in promoting this great cause. The youth will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate!"</p>
<p>(Note) We feel that Mr. Ying's proposed method is very meaningful. However, listing one thousand to ten thousand yuan as a team is inconsistent with the regulations of the "Special Fundraising." It would be more reasonable to raise twenty thousand yuan to form a team. For example, if ten people each donate two thousand yuan and specify that it be included in the "Happy New Year Scholarship Assistance Team," we will combine it to form a team and list the names of the donors afterward. In this way, both parties will find it convenient. And Mr. Ying's suggestion has already had a great effect in practice. Furthermore, our newspaper's principle for raising scholarship funds is to emphasize the free will of all sectors and never to coerce. If someone enthusiastically promotes fundraising and puts it into practice, that is of course even more welcome.</p>
<p>·New Year's Money Coupon· Sales Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai Company is responding to the scholarship movement by issuing New Year's money coupons for use as New Year's gifts. The company is also donating 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the coupons to the two newspapers to fund scholarships, while the coupons can still be fully redeemed. Since the sale began, purchases have been enthusiastic. We have now received another letter from the company stating that as of February 7, a total of 1,824,900 yuan had been sold, with 10% amounting to 182,490 yuan. After deducting 90,000 yuan allocated to the Xinwen Bao scholarship fund, a check for 92,490 yuan is attached.</p>
<p>·Variety Show· Preparations Completed</p>
<p>The long-planned college student variety show, organized by the University Alumni Advancement Society, was initiated in response to the Shen Bao's scholarship and poverty relief efforts. Preparations have been completed. The Yisheng Drama Society will perform "Joyful Reunion," and famous amateur actors will perform the Peking opera "The Story of Autumn," accompanied by film star singing and music. To encourage support from all sectors of society, a "Advancement" journal is being published, with Xu Jingjiang, Li Jianwen, Wu Chuanjia, Chen Wenfu, Wang Enbo, and Lu Junmin in charge of editing. It will be published soon, with rich content, promoting scholarship and poverty relief as the premise. All sectors are welcome to subscribe. Mail to No. 69, Lane 910, Weihaiwei Road.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Judicial Administration Issues Circular to Improve Prison Administration - Promote Prisoner Production Plan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that prison labor was originally intended to impart skills to those in prison, so that they can find a livelihood after release from prison and avoid unemployment.

If it can be used well and engaged in production, the benefits will be significant. Yesterday, a circular was issued to the higher procuratorates, strictly instructing the prison directors of the various prisons to be vigorous and to assess the economic conditions of the various prisons and the needs of society in terms of labor. They should select those that can be held, formulate detailed plans, and actively seek to expand them, and their merits and demerits will be determined based on the results of the management.</p>

<h3>Artillery Fire Faintly Heard: Berlin Becoming a Fortress; Fierce Battle for the Wuhle Bridgehead</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Berliners are now simultaneously hearing the artillery fire of Soviet troops 60 kilometers to the east, and engaging in the construction of defensive fortifications day and night, or undergoing intense training, intending to turn Berlin into a second Stalingrad. This determination fills the entire city. Dr. Goebbels, in charge of turning the capital into a fortress, is busy day and night guiding the formation of defense organizations, without a moment to spare. On the other hand, members of the People's Assault Squad, which bears the important task of defending Berlin, are actively receiving street fighting training, while female members wearing the People's Assault Squad armband are also working diligently all day long. Furthermore, female members of the Hitler Youth are building castles on the roads, striving to complete the fortification of Berlin. The decisive battle mood in Berlin has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: A German military spokesman announced on Thursday that the battle of the Wuhle River remains a battle for bridgeheads and has not yet become a large-scale offensive. The small Soviet bridgehead south of Frankfurt has slightly expanded, as has the Soviet bridgehead south of Küstrin. The bridgehead at Brieg-Ohlau has also gained importance through expansion.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Eastern Front situation was announced today as follows: The Zhukov forces have now established four bridgeheads on the west bank of the Wuhle River in the Frankfurt and Küstrin area. Since the 7th, they have been attempting a large-scale river crossing operation. The four bridgeheads are now being used as bases for large-scale river crossing operations, but have not yet been fully completed. Only infantry units have reached the west bank, while tank units have not yet crossed the river. Conversely, the Konev forces, securing the Brieg-Ohlau bridgehead in Silesia, are in a position to begin large-scale operations. Fierce fighting is underway in the small bridgehead established by the Soviet troops surrounded between Fürstenberg and Küstrin. German forces in the Seelow Heights area have the upper hand. German garrisons in Hynic-Teumer and Posen are still holding their original positions. A strong counter-offensive launched in the Schleich-Alrondalfeld area has been successful, thus completely shattering the Soviet attempt to attack the German defense line in East Prussia.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Since Thursday morning, the fighting in the Breslau-Groß Glogau-Liegnitz triangle area has developed into a major battle. Soviet troops launched an offensive from their Wuhle River bridgehead towards Steinau, supported in advance by a large number of motorized units. The Soviet advance to the south is clearly intended to cut off the railway and highway from Liegnitz to Upper Silesia, while simultaneously flanking the German forces defending Breslau. After launching several ineffective offensives, a Soviet armored unit advanced along the Wuhle River and occupied Beitzenweide.</p>
<h3>Alsace: Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuter: The anti-Axis forces have not yet begun an offensive in the area between the Meuse and the Eifel. German forces northwest of the Eifel are feeling pressured, and the right flank of the U.S. Ninth Army is also becoming active. The focus of the U.S. First Army's offensive is in the Schleiden area and southwest and west of Prüm, but progress is minimal. The U.S. Third Army attempted to cross the Our and Sauer rivers, but the bridgehead it established on the east bank was cleared by German forces. The situation in Alsace is fierce, and German rear guard units have withdrawn from the Ill area.</p>

<h3>Price Stabilization and Disciplinary Enforcement Work in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Ma Ji</p>
<p>As the end of the old year approaches, citizens of the capital are worried about rising prices. The military and political authorities have suddenly established a "Capital Materials Price Stabilization and Disciplinary Enforcement Committee," focusing on the free entry of rice into the city to implement price controls on daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, firewood, fish, meat, chicken, and duck. However, as everyone knows, most of the capital's daily necessities come from the surrounding countryside. Recently, due to a lack of transportation, these materials are transported into the city by manpower and animal power, and the price difference between the countryside and the city is often as high as 30-40%. Needless to say, the reason is extortion by unscrupulous military police along the way. The extent of this extortion is increasing day by day, resulting in vendors being unable to bear the demands and hesitating to move forward. As a result, prices in the city are rising all the way, even blocking the source of food such as rice, affecting the food supply for the capital's 600,000 residents.</p>
<p>Since the situation is so serious, if it is allowed to continue naturally, the consequences will be unimaginable. In particular, the Allied military police are committed to absolutely assisting our authorities in promoting price stabilization. Therefore, the two tasks of price stabilization and disciplinary enforcement officially began on February 1st.</p>
<p>In terms of the seven major daily necessities, disciplinary enforcement is certainly more important than price stabilization. But to enforce discipline, the first step is to improve the treatment of the military police. The "Price Stabilization and Disciplinary Enforcement Committee" has formulated "Regulations for the Distribution of Living Subsidies to Military Police in the Capital Urban Area." The characteristics of this regulation are: first, the amount of the subsidy is determined according to the then-current price of daily necessities; second, the distribution is carried out by personnel from the "Price Stabilization Committee" on a named basis; third, officers, military police officers, and police chiefs who have direct relatives who are unable to work will receive a monthly allowance of 10,000 yuan per relative. If prices rise further, the allowance may be increased at any time.</p>
<p>Since the restoration of the free transport of goods into the city, prices have fallen considerably. For example, rice has returned from a high of 24,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan, and thatch has fallen from 32,000 yuan to 24,500 yuan. However, what the public is worried about is the authorities' determination to enforce discipline, and how long the price stability can be maintained.</p>
<p>The price stabilization and disciplinary enforcement work began on February 1st. On the seventh day, the military law group of the committee discovered that Hong Zongyan, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the communications team of the Second Guard Division, had been sending his subordinates to intercept and extort money from people from time to time, taking 20-30 yuan per donkey load, earning about 1,000 yuan per day. He was arrested by the supervision team, and after interrogation, the charges were confirmed. He was executed by firing squad at Yuhuatai at 3 p.m. on the 7th. Hong Zongyan is the third person to be executed at Yuhuatai for corruption, after Hou Hu and Li Yanhan.</p>
<p>Since the measures were so swift and decisive at the time, and the Allied military police were absolutely assisting, ordinary speculative merchants naturally did not dare to do evil openly. But their lives are fundamentally dependent on rising prices. Prices do not have to fall, as long as there is a period of stability, they will be unable to maintain their "business." Therefore, the "Capital Bank," which had been open for less than two months, had insufficient turnover and was sold off for a good price. In addition, if prices can remain stable for three months, perhaps half of the more than 50 small banks in the capital will have to close down.</p>
<p>The people of the capital are well aware of the illegal operations of small banks and pawnshops. But it is said that these small banks and pawnshops all have powerful backers. For example, the last time the municipal government thoroughly investigated bank warehouses and found evidence of hoarding, it was several banks such as a certain bank in Nanjing. It can be seen that in order to fundamentally suppress prices in the future, it is necessary to thoroughly prohibit powerful people from operating businesses concurrently.</p>
<p>Also, recently, due to the temporary stabilization of prices, and the rise in Shanghai, Nanjing is also experiencing a surge in gold prices. Yesterday, the price of jewelry gold broke through 15 levels per tael. It is said that there is still a black market. It is impossible to guarantee whether daily necessities such as rice and firewood will be stimulated by this and rise along with it. Moreover, although rice and firewood have become cheaper and stabilized, the price of vegetables is rising sharply (greens have broken through the 300 yuan level). In short, the citizens of the capital, like the citizens of Shanghai, are constantly worried about their livelihood. (Sent on the 7th)</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Administration - Volume 1</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Administration in the Future</h3>
<p>— Luo Junqiang</p>
<p>Shanghai is known as an international city, but it is actually an abnormal city. In the past, Shanghai's municipal administration outside the concessions did not have the appearance of a modern city, and within the concessions, political power was controlled by foreigners. As a result of being ruled by Anglo-American imperialism for a century, Shanghai has been burdened with various derogatory names such as "abnormal Shanghai" and "sinful Shanghai." Since the Allies advocated the return of the concessions, the Shanghai concessions have been recovered for more than a year. In the future, all unreasonable situations left over from the poisonous legacy of Anglo-American imperialism must be thoroughly eliminated, while the necessary constructions and technologies of the past should still be retained as much as possible and appropriately adjusted. In the future, Shanghai must be adapted to the Chinese political system, implement Chinese laws, and under the grand principle of returning East Asia to East Asia, make Shanghai a Shanghai of China.</p>
<p>The past society of Shanghai, as a result of historical factors, emphasized foreign forces and had no national concept, recognized money and did not speak of justice, relied on power and had no law, and sought private gain without regard for public interest. This kind of atmosphere must be thoroughly eradicated. In the future, regardless of any bad forces, regardless of any interests, and without any consideration, we must sweep away past bad habits and gradually create a fresh atmosphere in Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in our country. Politically, it is a microcosm of China; economically, it is the heart of China; and culturally, it also has an important position. Especially at this critical time of decisive battle, in order to complete the war, we should do our best to make Shanghai's municipal administration coordinate with objective conditions, maintain the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, and reduce unnecessary suffering for citizens. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai, regardless of nationality or class, will cooperate sincerely with the municipal government to seek reasonable and legal improvement and development of Shanghai's municipal administration.</p>
<h3>Summary of the Municipal Government Structure (1)</h3>
<p>— Ting Yu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government began to have a unified organizational structure after August 1 last year. In terms of the current overview of the municipal government organization (please refer to the first table), there are nine bureaus, four offices, one library, seven county governments, six district offices, and two committees. Although councilors are not an organic organization (other bureaus, offices, libraries, etc. can independently issue documents to the outside world, councilors only assist the mayor and secretary-general in handling municipal affairs and cannot issue documents to the outside world), they belong to any bureau or office in the organizational system, so they are also considered a unit.</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Government has two characteristics in terms of organization: First, the current city of Shanghai has both urban areas and suburban county areas, and its scope seems to be between a province and a city. According to the regulations of the city organization law, all administrative affairs of the municipal government are directly handled by the bureaus and offices for the citizens, without district offices or county governments. The current system in Shanghai has districts and counties outside the bureaus, which is a dual administrative system. However, this characteristic cannot be changed based on financial and security considerations. Second, the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Government is huge. In other provinces and cities, the affairs managed by one agency are divided into two or three agencies in Shanghai. For example, the affairs managed by the Goods Allocation Office belong to the Economic Bureau in various provinces and cities; the affairs managed by the Land and Housing Management Committee for Absentee Owners belong to the Finance Bureau or the Land Administration Bureau in various provinces and cities. However, this fact is of course established due to the large population of Shanghai or other special characteristics.</p>
<p>The so-called municipal government is a general term that includes all affiliated agencies. The mayor is the highest leader of the municipal government, and he directs and supervises all agencies. The Secretariat of the Municipal Government is the central nervous system of the entire municipal government, carrying out the orders of the mayor and carrying out the actual and technical integrated work of directing and supervising the affiliated agencies.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity and clarity, this article focuses on tabular methods. The first table is the organizational system of the entire municipal government, and then the cell organizations and their jurisdiction of the affiliated agencies will be published successively. The order is first bureau, then office, and then various committees. When all agencies are presented in tables, the scope of responsibilities must be noted for departments arranged in numbers, such as the first section and the second section. Where the duties have been indicated, such as the General Affairs Section and the Investigation Section, they will no longer be indicated.</p>

<h3>Symposium on the Price Problem (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The price problem in our city, though extremely complex, has not, in our opinion, been managed reasonably. Since Mr. Xu Baoting took over as the new Director of the Economic Bureau, he has been actively seeking adjustments. For the sake of gathering diverse opinions, our newspaper has specially invited Director Xu, as well as figures from the economic world, including Mr. Chen Jin Chenyilang, Chen Riping, He Kan, Yao Qingsan, Xiang Kangyuan, and Li Zulu, to hold a symposium on the price problem. The symposium will be presided over by our newspaper's President Chen. The proceedings of the symposium are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>President Chen of this newspaper: The current high prices have a great impact on the country, society, and the lives of the people. Therefore, our newspaper has invited Director Xu of the Economic Bureau and all of you, hoping that you will express your valuable opinions on various important economic issues and discuss them in detail, centering on Director Xu. Today, there are four main points for discussion:</p>
<p>How should the standards for assessing prices be determined? In the past, despite the government's price controls, the black market still existed, and the prices assessed by the government were completely out of touch with the actual prices. On the one hand, it is true that the business community lacked the spirit of abiding by the law. On the other hand, the assessment of prices was baseless and could not take into account production costs, making it difficult to comply with the law in practice. Therefore, what methods should be used to assess prices, and what standards should be followed, are all issues worthy of study.</p>
<p>Methods for dealing with the black market. Once prices have been assessed, they should be absolutely adhered to, and the black market should be absolutely eliminated. Therefore, how to deal with the black market is the second issue we will discuss today.</p>
<p>Assessing prices and eliminating the black market are impossible without managing materials. Otherwise, it will be impossible to prevent hoarding within the industry and stockpiling outside the industry, and the upward trend of prices cannot be controlled. As a result, assessed prices will follow the rising prices. In addition, how to increase production should be planned comprehensively, and the prerequisite is also the management of materials. Therefore, the third issue we will discuss today is how to manage materials.</p>
<p>In the past, the rise in prices has been met with much public criticism. Now that the Economic Bureau has adjusted its personnel and strengthened its internal structure, it will surely bring a fresh start and meet the expectations of the citizens. With regard to trade associations, they should be strengthened first, and those with similar natures should be merged to reduce units and increase strength, so that the entire economic structure of Shanghai can move towards a sound path. This is the fourth issue that needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Now, let us first ask Mr. Xu to express his high views on the past work of the Economic Bureau and its future policies.</p>
<p>Xu Jiang: Price Assessment Standards: Regarding the productivity of goods, the prices in this city can be roughly divided into three types: agricultural products, industrial raw materials, and industrial finished products: (1) Agricultural products will have appropriate prices set based on investigations of prices at the place of origin and transportation and purchase situations, so as not to fluctuate at any time. (2) For industrial raw materials, the existing inventory in the urban area will be registered first, and sales will be restricted to prevent non-industry personnel from manipulating and affecting industrial costs. (3) For industrial finished products, the prices of raw materials have already been stabilized first, and then various aspects of factory costs and profits will be adjusted, so that the set prices will not be without standards.</p>
<p>Regarding management, the Price Assessment Council of this city is currently reorganizing its structure to strengthen the assessment power, and carefully supervise the pricing of trade associations, in order to ensure that the prices will be effective once they are assessed, and that the black market will disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>Methods for dealing with the black market: Recently, the high prices in this city have been caused by a complex set of factors. The use of a kind of black market by unscrupulous merchants has made it impossible for the public to trade without it, which hinders national policies and increases the burden on the people. This is truly hateful. This bureau has now strengthened its assessment power so that the effectiveness of the assessment can be comparable to the supply and demand of materials, without the need for the opportunity of the black market. If there is evidence that illegal elements are manipulating the black market, they will be severely punished to make the black market disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>Methods for managing materials: 1. Universally carry out electricity registration for industrial and commercial use, in order to unify management and increase production efficiency. 2. Send letters to various water and electricity companies to check whether the current power-using factories are legal and re-approve them. 3. Quickly register major commodities to prevent merchants from hoarding and manipulating. The registration method is based on filling out classified record books in accordance with the format. After the registration is completed, this bureau will formulate measures and submit them for approval and implementation. As for other controlled items, please also ask the relevant agencies to send the registered quantities to this bureau for verification on a monthly basis. 4. If major commodities that have not been registered encounter applications for movement certificates, they will not be accepted, in order to prevent such malpractices as non-industry personnel taking the opportunity to hoard and manipulate.</p>
<p>Reorganization of trade associations: According to the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations promulgated in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the organization of trade associations was originally intended to assist the government in implementing new economic policies, while also seeking the development of various industries and increasing production to meet wartime needs. However, the quality of the trade associations themselves has a great impact on the future of implementing new economic policies. Among the more than 200 trade associations in this city, the majority have a long history and sound organization, but there are also not a few that need to be adjusted due to improper personnel selection or overlapping organizations. The former should be strengthened, and the latter should be rectified in order to achieve soundness and avoid hindering the welfare of the industry and hindering the promotion of economic policies. For example, those with similar and overlapping organizations should be merged separately to be in accordance with the facts; increase the authority of the chairman of the board, and elect upright people to fill the position, so as to help promote government orders and make the movement of business conditions fully integrated into the right track. Then, advising registration, preventing hoarding, suppressing prices, and increasing production can achieve cooperative effects and adapt to the current important tasks. This is the recent mission of this bureau to reorganize trade associations.</p>
<p>He Kan: (1) Price Assessment Standards (A) For materials transported from other ports, the following items must be noted: Production costs, Local wholesale prices, Transportation costs, Losses along the way, Storage losses, Legitimate and illegitimate taxes along the way, Capital interest, Wholesale profits (not exceeding 20% of the total of the above seven items), Distributor profits (not exceeding 30% of the total of the above eight items). It is best to have well-known figures who are enthusiastic about public welfare personally go to the procurement location to conduct a trial purchase of a batch of goods, so that the assessment will not be deceived by merchants.</p>
<p>(B) For imported goods stockpiled in the hands of merchants, the following items must be noted: The original price before the incident, multiplied by the general cost of living index, must not be raised due to shortages. The price at which merchants purchase from stockpilers must be reasonable, and those who are unreasonable must be severely ordered to return the overcharged price. The pricing is still based on item A as the standard. Distributor profits must not exceed 30% of the above item's cost, and those who raise prices will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(C) Items manufactured in this city: Raw material value (calculated according to item A for those imported from other ports, and calculated according to item (B) for imported goods), Power consumption, Management fees and wages, Storage fees and consumption, Transportation fees, Capital interest, Manufacturer profits, not exceeding 20% of total expenses, Distributor profits, not exceeding 30% of purchase price.</p>
<p>(2) Methods for dealing with the black market: The Chinese and Japanese governments must absolutely cooperate, and the people of China and Japan must absolutely obey. Chinese, Japanese, and other foreign merchants holding materials must truthfully register, and any government guarantees not to use coercive means to confiscate these registered goods. It is strictly forbidden for officials to accept bribes to conceal merchants. For sold goods, there must be a receipt stub, which must state the name and address of the recipient for random checks. Strictly deal with selling inferior goods at high prices. Those who do not obey orders will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(3) Methods for managing materials: Absolutely prevent stockpiling by non-industry personnel, and prevent stockpilers from selling stockpiled goods within a certain period of time, and the price is assessed according to item 1. Buyers must register the names and quantities of the materials they purchase with the government at any time. Any stockpilers and merchants who do not sell goods should be severely punished. The goods sold and the remaining inventory each day must be recorded on a separate list and submitted to the various associations for submission to the Economic Bureau for verification. This regulation is jointly complied with by Chinese, Japanese, and foreign merchants, and those who do not comply will be subject to the same punishment.</p>
<p>(4) Reorganization of trade associations: Operators of each type of material or business should only form a unified trade association, and should not create names to set up similar associations. The association is a place for colleagues to exchange opinions and connect feelings, and should not operate its own business. If the association wants to revise the selling prices of goods and wages, it must submit a request to the competent authority for approval with appropriate reasons before it can be implemented. If there are hooligans and local tyrants who control the association with evil forces, the competent authority has the right to punish and terminate them.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions to this publication.</p>
