<h3>蔣主席召見平津首長　聽取各地收復報告　華北東北局勢益安定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平十三日電〕蔣主席蒞平後，上自外交要員，下至人力車夫，一致表示甚大歡欣。衆信華北及東北局勢必將益趨安定，且自主席關懷民瘼，勤求民隱，布告發出後，平津兩地敵僞產業之接收，捕奸工作之進行，顯有轉趨積極之勢。主席蒞平後，即召見當地高級官員，總取關於平津及華北收復狀况之報告。主席此次係乘四引擎機，偕蔣夫人同來，下榻於本市北區某處。門外站一頭載鋼盔之衛兵，此爲蔣主席寓邸周團僅有之戒備。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十三日電〕據今日此間可靠消息：蔣委員長與蔣夫人赴平目的，除宣慰民衆與視察華北情形外，乃準備在該城歡迎美國駐華新大使馬歇爾將軍，衆料行政院院長宋子文於馬氏抵達之前，亦將前來此間。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十三日電〕衆信國府還都南京前，蔣主席或將訪問收復區其他城市，若果成成。似將訪問上海，南京及廣州。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津十三日電〕蔣主席蒞平，同時國軍復由陸空兩路開入瀋陽長春，使一般觀察家咸信，東九省東部，不出數星期即可由國民政府完全接收。東北境內共軍，幾全無抵抗，蘇聯態度，亦甚友好。東北保安司令杜聿明，在重慶，北平兩地與蔣主席會商後，即飛返東北司令部，下令部下開入瀋陽。同時北平國軍，亦分乘美國運輸機開赴長春。蔣主席抵平消息，未言蔣夫人與宋院長偕來，惟美國第三水陸部隊司令洛基少將及其參謀長留平業已數日，大約係欲會晤蔣主席。蔣主席此次蒞臨舊都，已益增華北事件將有迅速解決之望，內戰流血，可以完全避免。此外並聞杜聿明部已推進至瀋陽西北一百二十華里處，顯係向哈爾濱進發，依照目下行軍速度，當可於聖誕日抵哈，</p>
<p>〔中央社天津十三日電〕津市長張廷　，十三日午日平返津。張氏係於十二日赴平，當日晋調蔣主席，報告津市接收情形。主席對大沽新港，極為重視，飭早日完成，以促進北方之繁榮與發展。張氏今日返津後，即召集各有關方面談話，詐為計劃，俾即日與工。</p>
<h3>長春談判繼續中　蔣經國即自東北飛平報告</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕熊式輝告往訪記者稱：長春談判，繼續進行中，目前尙未告一段落，記者詢以何時赴長春，熊氏答稱：『快了罷』。某外籍記者告以彼擬一週內經錦州進入瀋陽，熊對此可能表示懷疑，似此則國軍最近恐未能進入瀋陽，預定空運長春國軍，在平準備已久，但迄十二日下午，尙未奉到出發命令。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕行營消息，蔣經國即飛平，向最高當局報告長春談判情形，此間傳蔣氏一俟東北接收談判完竣，即另就他職。新疆外交特派員劉澤熒，將繼續辦理東北外交。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十三日電〕今日中央社消息：根據現在長春之中國軍事代表團團長與蘇軍參謀長獲得之協定，國軍於接收東北各城時，蘇聯軍隊將予以協助，此乃國軍空運東北之技術談判中所獲多項協定之一。此外尙有下列數點：（一）國軍降陸時，蘇軍將負責　衛飛機塲，（二）中國空軍將在各飛機塲設立無綫電站，以便引導運輸飛機之開達，（三）中國行政長官接收東北各城及各區時，蘇方連絡人員將伴同前往。中央社稱：國軍降落各飛機塲之確定地點，業已同意。據傳華方要求准予使用長春電力强大之廣播電台，而蘇軍參謀長允與馬林諾夫斯基元帥會商後儘速答覆。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據重慶十三日廣播稱：『新民報』載，國軍已自陸路開入瀋陽城，並稱空運國軍之第一架運輸機，已在長春降陸。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十三日電〕此間中國權成方面對外傳國軍已開入瀋陽之消息，表示懷疑。該方而指出，在過去兩星期中，謠傳瀋陽已入國軍之手甚熾，然大部份均缺乏任何根據。目下國軍之開入瀋陽，正待蘇方之通知，一俟接到，立即開拔。然據與錦縣杜聿明將軍司令部接近者稱，北平方面尙無接到蘇方通知之消息。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十三日電〕據悉，東北行營籌備處，定十七日起開始遷平。</p>

<h3>何思源談話</h3>
<p>共軍任意破壞　魯省損害慘重</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南十三日電〕日軍投降後，山東共產黨軍隊對鐵路，工廠，礦山，學校等機關任意破壞，何主席思源頃再發表談話稱：日本投降時，本人即通令全省各部隊，首先掌握城垣，保護交通工礦，幷集合部隊馳抵濟南，迅速接收，詎意共產軍對我接收部隊猛烈攻擊，對城市工商業，交通綫礦塲等，更肆意破壞不已。按其破壞之重，爲歷年所未有，尤以鐵路爲甚，同時共產軍爲據大內亂力量，積極擴軍，凡十五歲以上至五十歲之男子，均被强迫入伍，最近甚至十二歲之幼童，十五歲至廿二歲之婦女，亦被强征當兵，凡共產軍到處，靑年男女莫不相率逃避，我軍駐處，近均人滿爲患，如濟南一地，據最近調查，各地學校因遭共軍破壞，失學來濟靑年已達萬人，至靑島者約在五千以上，本府雖盡其力量，令各學校增多班次及設立補習班，亦勢難容納。最近一月中逃來濟南難民至十萬左右，因天氣漸寒，形同乞丐，各難胞　躅街頭，狀至可憐，本府　發動各界各慈善機關組織賬濟委員會，在市內分設五個救濟站，以最低限度計算，約需一億五千萬元，若沿交通綫普遍設立，則至少需二十七億元。此外，因共軍封鎖物資，破壞交通，以致工商業蕭條，工廠停工，因而失業之工人，濟市一隅，在五萬人以上，淄川，博山，張店礦區，因採煤機器被共軍破壞，工人宿舍被共軍焚毀，失業工人在十萬以上。棗莊·大汶口·新泰·萊蕪各礦區，失業工人在十二萬以上均待赶施救濟，已釀成目前最嚴重之問題，至於廣大農村壯丁被裏脅，耕牛車輛被征去，縱經收復，短時間恐亦絕難恢復元氣，日本控制八年之損失，尙不如三個月損失之慘重。各鐵道，橋樑，涵洞，自修築以來，從未遭如今日之大破壞，枕木被焚，鐵軌抬走路慕扒平，甚至挖成溝洞，電杆電綫車站各種設備，均被毀一空，即以鐵路器材一項，在此數月內，經隨壞隨修，修而復毀，毀而復修者，據最近之統計，其價値已達四十億元以上，工礦設備被毀者，達一百二十億元以上，經國家數十年以無數人力，物力所成之建設，今則一旦毀於共軍之手，誠堪今人痛心，此不過可得目覩之有形損失，至於因此影響各方面所受之無形損失，將不可以數目計矣。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾特使履任後　美宣布對華政策　受降任務完成美軍即撤退</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統本日宜稱：駐華美海軍陸戰隊，俟執行日本投降事宜完竣後，即將撤回本國。美對華全部政策，當在渠之特使馬歇爾將軍抵達中國後予以宣布。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電）美海外部隊總司令房特格利夫中將，今日致函共和黨議員要特生云，美軍奉命履行對於中國盟友之義務，結束對日戰爭，並協助解除在華日軍之武裝，此項任務現正在進行中，預料任務完成以後，美軍未必再留駐中國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕據昨晚消息，美軍在華北尙將留駐多月，除非馬歇爾能使國共雙方及早成立協定，則又當別論。據外交界人士稱，美軍最早撤退時期，約在四五月之後。美軍留華以待日軍全部退出中國，此乃美國政策所在，已由官方表而出之。按華北黃河及長城間，尙有日軍三十二萬五千人，台灣及中國全境，尙有日軍一百三十萬人。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕美前任駐華大使赫爾利宣稱，最近檢討美國對華政策大綱，已顯示良好影響，此種公開宣布，亦可相助於馬歇爾將軍到任後，促使中國各黨各派團結，以建設强固統一之民主政府。赫爾利稱，此項政策之宣布，係由「紛爭」而起，所謂「紛爭」顯係指彼於十一月二十七日突然辭職所引起之風潮而言。</p>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕衆院共和黨議員羅傑斯夫人，頃要求該院對美國外交政策曁前駐華大使赫爾利辭職之理由再加調查，據謂，爲探知美外交政策是否被人破壞計，此種審查實風必要。羅夫人發表意見時，該院接獲國務卿員爾納斯之報告云：「余對破壞吾人對華政策之說，並無所聞」。</p>

<h3>社論　政府宣慰與人民陳訴</h3>
<p>蔣主席於十一日蒞平，十二日就公告准許人民陳訴痛苦。葉楚傖鈕永建兩位中央大員，奉命宣慰蘇浙皖三省，十一日飛抵上海，昨在康樂酒家茶會席上，對市民備致溫慰，各界代表也都能直言無隱，陳述他們的願望。這是最近値得大書特書的一件喜事。</p>
<p>政府與人民原屢一體。政府離不開人民，人民也丟不了政府。政府應瞭解人民所受的痛苦，人民也當知道政府處境的艱難。本來國民革命的任務，起碼就是解除人民的痛苦，其終極目的是要建設一個自由平等的新中國，艱難險阻也在一般人民意料之中。不過抗戰以還，國府西遷，中樞當局與收復區同胞，八年睽隔，天各一方，雖關懷想念，彼此相同，究不若平時上下溝通，易於爲力。當日寇投降之初，各收復地區的接收工作，曾一度引起若千誤會，護論紛紛，其實一半固由於接收人員良券不齊，而一半也因爲睽隔太久，瞭解謂差之故。只要人民能够老實負責的說話，政府能够虛心努力去辦事，則人民的好惡，就不難成爲政府興革的準　，政府還怕沒有人民作後盾麼？我們聽到政府大員來宣慰人民，尤其接到　蔣主席親蒞北平准許陳訴的電報，眞是萬分興舊。這是中樞懷念收復區。這是政府重視人民。這更是政府與人民打成一片的祥光和氣。</p>
<p>政府宣慰，好像祇是口頭的工作，實則何嘗祗是口頭工作？收復區的父老兄弟諸姑姊妹，八年來受盡敵寇的茶毒，奸逆的壓迫，長夜漫漫，度日如年，其精神痛苦，眞有難言之隱。他們滿擬一旦天明，可以重見天日。詎知光明雖見，簿霧未消。由於期望過深，不覺責難過切。中央洞察隱情，乃有宣慰。宣慰的用意，當不僅限於口頭的解釋。我們相信　蔣主席以及中央大員，在各地耳聞目覩，博訪周諮，必能探求眞正民意之所在，從民意的好惡上，毅然決然的典利華弊，除暴安良。只要政府辨是非，明賞罰，人民就一定會全心全力來擁護政府的設施。這是嚴現實的，也是最理想的。這樣的宣慰，眞可使母個老百姓　受嘉惠，永遠忘不了中央的德意。</p>
<p>反過來說，我們要希望政府宣慰眞能有裨得於人民的實際生活，須得先回頭看看我們人民自已有無領受宣慰的資格，能否忠實無　不增不减的陳訴自己的痛苦。國家民族，遭逢大難，血戰八年，僅乃獲勝。流離顚沛，斷頭折臂者，不知萬千。這其間，如果只知繩營狗茍，自私自利，國難財發了，再發勝利財，甚至不惜與敵奸往還，魚肉鄉里，這種人縱一時未必盡付懲治，也當自慚形穢，豈能搖身一變，也混在忠實善良的父老裏來同受宜慰？其次，政府旣然准許人民陳訴痛苦，我們人民就得如　蔣主席所說，除了挟嫌誣告處揑聳聽以外，要有膽量有見識的直說出來。中國老百姓往往有一種弱點，受了枉曲不願爭，受了苛擾不敢說，以爲「吃虧就是便宜」，人民何敢得罪官府。「只許州官放火，不許百姓點燈」，在百姓旣是默默無言，在州官自然肆無忌憚。殊不知國民政府決不是專制政府，國民政府決不「官官相護」，而非決苛擾的官吏軍警，在光天化日之下必不容其倖存。人民在讀了　蔣主席蒞平以後的公告，應該知道有自己應盡的職責。自己受了枉曲，限淚只吞到肚裏；自己受了苛擾，只怪自己的苦命。這樣的人民，何能造成一個民主國家？現在政府頗有民主作風，盡量讓我們負責說話，倘使人民還不詳詳盡盡的說出來，還不舉出受枉曲遭苛擾的具體事實，要求懲治，還怪得誰來！</p>
<p>總之：我們願意從此政府隨時隨地均有可以使人民安慰的舉措，人民也有隨時隨地向政府陳訴痛苦的權利，直到痛苦究全解除爲止。</p>

<h3>主席關懷民間疾苦　深盼滬市民陳訴</h3>
<p>各界昨歡迎葉鈕兩宣慰大使</p>

<p>葉楚傖氏盼聆民間意見言由錢市長致介紹詞，繼即由宣慰使節葉楚傖氏致辭，謂楚傖等離渝時，承主席指示，「此去要多聽民間的話，余對東南民衆，關懷殷切，東南民衆疾苦，務聽明澈。」今日報上見主席赴平，在行轅設陳訴箱，即在使民衆意見，均可投人箱中，使主席得一一明瞭，一一解決。楚等到此，不願多講話，郤要請各位多多講話，楚等即係陳訴箱，希望各位發表意見，當儘量呈報中央，楚等希望諸位意見務使一一實現，而以因困難而不能實行者爲例外，日前有一位江蘇革命老前輩會談及大變之後，必有相當時間，方能整理就緒。在辛亥革命時，國家社會受到極大變動的僅爲政治方面，經濟則未受影響，這次戰爭的破壞，十倍於辛亥時代，經濟方面，所受破壞很大，故我們更應該注意到經濟方面的復員，我們的任務，一直要到各位所提供的意見都實施後，才算完成。今天不過是開始而已王曉籟氏陳述商界希望商會主席王曉籟氏致詞，略謂：「主席關懷上上海物便，親常杜月笙先生協助政府，設法平抑，物價漸漸下降，現在已告穩定。關於民營國營之範圍，希望從速規定。各項產權，亦望迅予確定。敵僞產業當由政府封存處置，人民的產業，也要迅速歸還，人民並希望補助原有廠家，俾有復興機會。此外收拾民心，最主要的任務，在使人民能安居樂業，因此關於共軍變亂問題希望中央迅速處置，否則國家不堪設想，我們民衆一致擁護中央，當機立斷，戡定內亂。</p>
<p>各界代表繼續陳述疾苦</p>
<p>（一）銀行界代表徐寄廎氏繼起致詞，徐氏首先報告抗戰期間上海地下工作者之銀團情形及渠本人協助政府穩定滬市金融經過，謂：繼今後我國建設工作，應注意下列數點，（一）安定民生，（二）增加生產，（三）鞏固金融，（四）復興經濟，要復興中國，先要復興上海，要復興上海，首在復興經濟。（四）敎育界代表金通尹致辭，略謂；學生失學問題，尚未完全解決，希望中央盡量增加敎育經費，改善敎職員生活，俾教職員得能安心敎書，學生亦有求學機會。（三）學生代表陳目生稱已登記之蒙難者有九百十八人，希望中央（甲）對爲參加建國復員而努力的靑年學生，予以最大的鼓勵與指示。（乙）建設復興，必須培植人材，希望中央頒佈具體訓練計劃，俾靑年有正確報國途徑，以創造三民主義新中國。（丙）對學生運動盼有正確領導，俾協助黨政展開復員工作。（四）總工會周學湘致辭提出意見四點（甲）抗日工人現告失業，希望中央救濟。（乙）勝利後敵僞工廠停工，失業工人驟增三十萬，現工廠復工者僅十分之一，致工人失業問題極爲嚴重，希望政府予以普遍救濟。（五）農會代表侯雋人致辭，希望政府對農村損失，切賞調查，並予以切實救濟。對農村敎育，尤須特別注意，並加緊造就人材。（六）婦女會代表錢劍秋致辭謂；深望中央今後婦女運動，多多注意扶植。</p>
<p>程監察使注視地方財政</p>
<p>繼由葉楚傖介紹中央派在上海的長期耳目程監察使中行起立致辭，提出渠到滬後三月所見所聞之報告四點，（一）接收問題，鬧了四個月，仍有使人不能滿意之處，研究其問題癥結，第一最初無通盤計劃，第二職權未劃分淸楚，第三接收人員技術太差。（二）地方政治問題，監察使署在滬成立後，接到訴狀甚多，其中大多爲控告各地縣長及行政常局，控告的罪名，都是隨意抓人，隨意派款，人民的生命財產，沒有保陣。究其原因，請兩位特使回報中央，在收復區內，中央對地方財政太不注意，京滬沿綫各縣，每月支出須二三千萬元，而收入僅四五百萬元，連地方敎育經費，也無着落，於是弊病百出，現在最要緊的是，一方面要地方撙節開支，一方面要中央解決地方財政困難。（三）軍風紀問題，極爲嚴重，主席不能到每一小縣鎭去巡視，而人民和官吏，均不敢講話。（四）五權憲法之五權，在地方政治上極爲重要，整頓地方政治，最基本問題，莫過於充分發揮五權效能，這也是人民的最低要求。</p>

<p>普善山莊開辦迄今，已有三十二年之久，掩理暴露，施送棺木，施診給藥，創設義校，成續卓著。所有經費，全賴各界捐助，近因節屆冬令，飢寒交迫之路斃乞丐，日趨增多。法院寄囚罪犯之屍體，又多責令其棺殮，耗費之鉅，可以想見。所存施材，為數有限，非從速購料添製，勢將無法應付。故於昨日開會討論，議決敦請名票名伶，於本月十五十六兩日，假座格洛克路六十號樓上建成電台，播音募捐，業蒙該電台允盡義務，不收電費，希望聽衆樂善好施，慨捐鉅款，以襄善舉。</p>
<h3>政府貸欸各工廠　首批約為九億元　須由經濟部嚴格調查</h3>

<h3>樂敎運動</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>一般人以爲音樂可以愉快身心，安慰精神，把它當做一種高尚的娛樂。其實音樂與人類的關係，不僅僅乎這一方面，有比娛樂更深切的。因爲音樂有潛移默化的作用，它可以改變人格，陶冶性情，能够使人類的生活向上，所以還可以利用音樂作爲敎化社會的工具。</p>
<p>與人格的改變有直接效率的，大約可以分做三端：即道德，宗敎，藝術。其中道德是因偉人的人格的感化而達到目的的；宗敎是由於神的信仰而獲得效果的；藝術則是直接接觸感情而實行的。道三種改變人格的方法各不相同，可是道德與宗敎的悠化人格，它的手段須借助於偉人與神，音樂則是直接以感情接觸人格，它的感化力自然比道德與宗敎更爲切實，更爲强大。我們要涵養性情，完成人格非音樂不可，這事實已爲東西學者所共認。</p>
<p>我國的孔子處於春秋亂世，爲挽救當時的人心，盛倡禮樂。他說：「典於詩，立於禮，成於樂」。在孔子看起來，音樂的意義非常重大，不但敎育個人，即治理國家也需要音樂。西洋的希臘大哲學家如柏拉圖（Plato）主張以音樂治陶性情；亞理斯多德（Aristotle）說音樂科係愉快的一種修養的手段。現今的歐美諸國也都認高尚的音樂爲品性修養的必要品。這都是以音樂為陶冶道德品性，培養優美感情的工具的事實。</p>
<p>我國古來聖賢治國，還主張以音樂並重，因為禮是所以規律生活外表的行爲，樂是調節內在的精神，換句話講：禮是形式的，樂是精神的。荀子在他的樂論篇內有如是的說法：「在行爲方面，音樂可以使意志得廣，容貌得莊，行列得正，進退得齊。……可以使耳目聰明，心氣和平，移風易俗，天下皆寗。」照他的見解，禮與樂是相依為用的，禮的力車有所不及的地方，可以用樂來完成它的效果。</p>
<p>禮與樂間的關係密切如是，希望在倡新生活聲中，積極地把樂敎運動行起來。</p>
<h3>犧牲</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>歷史的短篇</p>
<p>初夏的傍晚是絢麗的，天空一片碧藍的顏色，上面抹着淡黃淺紅以及紫色的雲，配合得那麼勻稱和諧。荊軻走在市梢那邊，向天空望了半嚮，忽又埀下頭來嘆了一口氣。他好像有滿懷的抑鬱，無法吐露似的。</p>
<p>剛走進市街，要想拐彎的時候，迎面走來了田光。田光僂着身子，臉色也很陰沉；他上了年紀，行步有點艱難，可是還顯着矯健的樣子。荊軻看見了，趕忙走上一步說道：</p>
<p>『田處士，幾天不見，怎麼面有憂色呢？』</p>
<p>『恐怕我們都有這樣的心情，你的臉鈀也並不好看。』</p>
<p>荊軻不由得笑了一笑，但道是凄凉的苦笑，隨即問道：『秦國出兵伐齊攻楚，確實消息到底怎樣？』</p>
<p>『我們燕國當然很危險呀，韓王已經被虜，秦兵南面伐齊，北面攻擊趙國，燕國的命運十分可怕，現在要「合縱」，也似乎太遲了。</p>
<p>『就是這句話，「合縱」已經來不及了』荊軻說。『那麼處士有什麼高見呢？』</p>
<p>田光無限感喟地嘆了一口氣說道：『我是老弱無能，雖然報國心切，可是有什麼辦法？今天太子丹竟把國家大計跟我相商，我不揣冒昧，已經把你薦舉了，請你明天去見見太子，我想太子一定要重用你的。』</p>
<p>『男兒以身報國，本來是分內的事。』荊軻說得激昂慷慨。田光把深沉的目光注視他半嚮，感動地伸出了右手，拍拍荊軻的肩頭說：</p>
<p>『那麽好目為之吧，燕國的存亡，就靠着你們這些肯犧牲的壯士』</p>
<p>荊軻自送這老人家走遠了，才回頭走去。他心裏兀自想着明大怎樣去見太子丹。國家這樣危急，強暴的秦國要拙毀幾個小國是不需要多大力量的。現在各小國聯合的機會已經沒有了，那一定得想個最直接最有效的辦法，才可以挽救臨在燕國的急難。</p>
<p>他這樣一邊走一邊想。已經走到一家小酒店門口，這小酒店是荊軻常常來喝酒的地方。今天他又的了高漸離在這兒喝酒。他抬起頭來，看見高漸離跟狗屠兩個人，正在端着酒杯痛飲，一大碗熱騰騰的狗肉放在桌子上面，部一定是狗屠今天又殺了一隻肥狗，呌道兒的老闆娘預先煮熱的。　（未完）</p>

<h3>李陵曲</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵</p>
<p>匈奴侵漢地，將軍出塞征。單于兵十萬，勢如暴雨傾；我有六路師，的會在天明，五路迷失途，悵望嗟星晨。我有五千衆，英勇孰與京，跋涉多疲乏，步馬莫能爭。奮臂呼將士，將士齊請纓，拔刀指胡處，胡虜爲我驚，天地爲震怒，殺敵頭顱輕；戰士多飲血，單于欲退兵。誰知有漢奸，洩我虛實將，兵窮箭一空，糧盡援程絕，安得申包胥，號哭乞秦庭。吁嗟呼，我被擄兮身受辱，欲報漢德兮空留名，念虛死不如立節兮，耿耿此心兮誰爲明？</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>莫做罪行的承繼人</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>敵偽在戰爭期內覇佔了許多國人的公產和私產，這類的產業已和敵產偽產同時被政府各機關分頭接收了下來。因爲是分頭接收，所以在當初接收的時候情形相當混亂。經過了三個月來幾度的大員蒞臨，幾度的調整統一，在處理的機構上已見逐步走上軌道。但是接收者，保管者以至現在的使用者的心理上行動上却依舊並未感覺到急待分別處理的需要。他們只知道同屬敵偽手中接收下來的東西，以爲應當受着同樣支配的命運。他們並不去分淸這是敵公產，敵私產，僞公產，僞私產或是敵僞的覇佔產。這種嚴重的錯誤足以遭致人民的抱怨懷恨甚至超過從前對於敵僞所抱怨懷恨的情緒。何以故？人民受敵偽的覇佔是在意料之中，而現在的遭遇却在意料之外，所以怨恨的心也就深了。</p>
<p>强盜搶了老百姓的東西，你爲老百姓趕走强盜，追回臟物，老百姓當然十分感激你。但是你若以爲「這東西是我從强盜手中取來的，當然由我用」，或是拿出「比待我來用一陣子再說」的辦法來，即使是最馴良的老百姓怕也要抱怨懷恨！</p>
<p>這類的事情，怕是不少，在我這樣的和社會接觸範圍十分狹小的人的眼裏便有兩起：一是XX中學的校舍，眼看着別人在用，收回無期，反倒自己向別處商借房屋開學。一是XX大戲院（原屬英籍華人XX的產業）被一紙手諭接管了變成了電影院。什麼文化，什麼學校敎育，什麼話劇運動，這些久已被人看成無足輕重的理論了，我們且不去談他。但是這不是敵產，不是僞產，這是國人的校產，盟籍人的私產。從前的覇佔是敵僞的罪行！現在承繼使用，應當顧慮到莫做了罪行的承繼人！</p>

<h3>實力派不斷收購　金價連續上漲</h3>
<p>汽油款結價刺戟買氣</p>
<p>烚赤昨空方希圖背城借一，上塲繼續加以壓力，初開即自六八萬五退至六七萬二，籌碼枯竭，散戶逢低吸收，此後即盤旋而上，北帮及川帮銀行紛來購買，遂穿出七〇萬大關，某號空頭加碼，浮多脫手，此後在七〇萬大關內外，屢進屢退，多空雙方極盡能力，互相角逐，直至午刻尚在六九萬左右掙扎，迨後津贛兩帮續來補進，七〇萬大關遂告堅定，同時盛傳對美滙率定一千五之說，乃扶搖直上，中間雖因銀行方面逢高吐出，稍多曲折，結果因美鈔奇俏，烚赤遂以最高價結束，結果較前收再漲三萬五，趨勢大有勇往直前，繼續邁進之槪，查金市在銀行方面不斷吸收，籌碼已掃數流入實力派手中，本報已一再提及，市上種種無理揣測，少數人酒後茶餘之談，憑空構造，迄無事實證明，反之汽油結款，非但在自由市價之上，且超過敎會滙率頗多，遂有今午一千五對一之傳說，事實上過低之滙率，有使本國工廠頻於破產之處，過高亦非盟方所歡迎，一切當待當局之審愼決定，是以高漲後恐將轉盤，銀樓飾金掛高爲七萬八，紋銀仍爲六百元，銀元的四百三左右，拆息仍爲一角至一角二分間。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔昨在廠商脫金套購下，始終堅定，最低一〇七五元，後即逐步拉上，午刻已穿出一一〇〇元大關外，汽油結款今日續有繳款，結價約一四二五元，（每介侖美鈔二角八分結法幣價四百元），市上並有對美滙率有定一千五對一之說紛傳，本已求過於供之美鈔，買氣被激更烈，價亦扶搖直上，以頂峯收市，結果較前收漲七十元，而買風尚在縱續瀾漫下，喊價尚在增高中，港幣以限於環境，雖堅而尚感牽制，結果校前收老貨好十元，新貨好二元，澳鎊約値美鈔二元六角，羅比二角七八分。</p>
<p>證券　公債昨市能恍惚，中途曲折多盤，最後雖因買戶活動，一度拉高，但結果仍較前收爲軟，惟丁種反略漲，差價繼續軋攏，外股以收市較早，市况萎靡，結果巨型者較之前收略有下跌，小型者則略漲。</p>
<p>米糧　米市到消兩平，形勢挺定，中關略升一二百元，麵粉亦然，油價以店銷轉股，市面活潑，回漲一二千元，黃豆勢成擯局，生仁隨到隨銷，升沉不定，豆餅平正，棉餅以近日燃料回跌，隨之不振。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Leaders of Peiping and Tientsin to Hear Reports on the Recovery of Various Areas; Situation in North and Northeast China Increasingly Stable</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 13th] Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Peiping, from high-ranking diplomatic officials to rickshaw pullers, all have expressed great joy.  It is widely believed that the situation in North and Northeast China will become increasingly stable. Furthermore, since the Chairman has shown concern for the people's suffering and diligently sought out their concerns, the progress of receiving enemy and puppet property and carrying out the work of arresting traitors in Peiping and Tientsin has shown a tendency to become more active after the promulgation of the order. Immediately after arriving in Peiping, the Chairman convened local senior officials to collect reports on the recovery situation in Peiping, Tientsin, and North China. The Chairman arrived on a four-engine plane with Madame Chiang, and is staying at a certain location in the northern district of the city. A helmeted guard stands outside the door, which is the only security measure around Chairman Chiang's residence.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 13th] According to reliable sources here today: The purpose of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang's visit to Peiping, in addition to comforting the people and inspecting the situation in North China, is to prepare to welcome the new U.S. Ambassador to China, General Marshall. It is expected that the President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, will also arrive here before Marshall's arrival.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] It is widely believed that before the National Government returns to Nanjing, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek may visit other recovered cities. If this happens, he is likely to visit Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 13th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Peiping, coupled with the National Army's entry into Shenyang and Changchun by both land and air, leads general observers to believe that the eastern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces will be completely taken over by the National Government within a few weeks. The Communist forces in the Northeast have offered almost no resistance, and the Soviet attitude is also very friendly. Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Forces, flew back to the Northeast Command after consulting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing and Peiping, ordering his subordinates to enter Shenyang. At the same time, the National Army in Peiping also boarded American transport planes to Changchun. While news of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Peiping did not mention Madame Chiang and President Song accompanying him, Major General Rockey, commander of the U.S. 3rd Amphibious Corps, and his chief of staff have been staying in Peiping for several days, presumably to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's visit to the old capital has further increased the hope that the North China issue will be resolved quickly and that civil war and bloodshed can be completely avoided. In addition, it is heard that Du Yuming's troops have advanced to 120 li northwest of Shenyang, apparently heading for Harbin. According to the current marching speed, they should arrive in Harbin by Christmas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The Mayor of Tianjin, Zhang Ting'e, returned to Tianjin from Peiping on the afternoon of the 13th. Zhang went to Peiping on the 12th and reported the situation of the reception of Tianjin City to Chairman Chiang. The chairman attached great importance to the Dagukou New Port, ordering it to be completed as soon as possible to promote the prosperity and development of the North. After returning to Tianjin today, Zhang convened all relevant parties for talks to formulate plans so that the work can be started immediately.</p>
<h3>Negotiations in Changchun Continue; Chiang Ching-kuo to Fly from Northeast to Peiping to Report</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 13th] Xiong Shihui told visiting reporters: The negotiations in Changchun are continuing, and have not yet come to an end. When the reporter asked when he would go to Changchun, Xiong replied: "Soon, I suppose." A foreign reporter told him that he planned to enter Shenyang via Jinzhou within a week. Xiong expressed doubt about this possibility. It seems that the National Army may not be able to enter Shenyang recently. The National Army scheduled to be airlifted to Changchun has been preparing in Peiping for a long time, but as of the afternoon of the 12th, they had not yet received departure orders.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 13th] According to the Command Headquarters, Chiang Ching-kuo will fly to Peiping to report to the highest authorities on the situation of the Changchun negotiations. It is rumored here that Chiang will take another position as soon as the Northeast reception negotiations are completed. Liu Zeyong, Xinjiang Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs, will continue to handle Northeast diplomacy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] Today's Central News Agency reported: According to the agreement reached between the head of the Chinese military delegation in Changchun and the Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army, the Soviet Army will provide assistance when the National Army receives the cities in the Northeast. This is one of the many agreements obtained in the technical negotiations for the airlift of the National Army to the Northeast. In addition, there are the following points: (1) When the National Army lands, the Soviet Army will be responsible for guarding the airfield; (2) The Chinese Air Force will set up radio stations at various airfields to guide the arrival of transport aircraft; (3) Soviet liaison personnel will accompany the Chinese administrative officials when they receive various cities and regions in the Northeast.

It is reported that the Chinese side requested permission to use the powerful broadcast station of Changchun Electric Power, and the Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army promised to consult with Marshal Malinovskij and reply as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] After arriving at Goubangzi, it is heard that a certain unit of the National Army has continued to advance and will soon arrive in Panyang. Another unit of the National Army has recently arrived at Goubangzi. The troops waiting to be airlifted to Changchun are still being assembled and are ready to depart within days.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to Chongqing Radio on the 13th: "Xinmin Daily" reported that the National Army had entered Shenyang City by land, and also stated that the first transport plane of the airlifted National Army had landed in Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 13th] Chinese authoritative sources here expressed doubt about the news that the National Army has entered Shenyang. They pointed out that in the past two weeks, rumors that Shenyang had fallen into the hands of the National Army were rampant, but most of them lacked any basis. At present, the National Army's entry into Shenyang is awaiting notification from the Soviet side. As soon as it is received, they will set off immediately. However, according to those close to General Du Yuming's headquarters in Jin County, Peiping has not received any news of notification from the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] It is learned that the Preparatory Office of the Northeast Headquarters is scheduled to start moving to Peiping from the 17th.</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] Communist forces are trying to prevent the National Army from entering Chahar, and it is heard that the war there has intensified. According to news from Nanjing, the Communist forces have formed a Suwan Border Region Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] (1) The Communist army in southern Jin attempted to besiege Wenxi City without success, so they shifted their main force and launched a fierce attack on Dongzhen.

<h3>He Siyuan's Talk</h3>
<p>Communist Army Destroys Arbitrarily, Shandong Province Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] After the Japanese army surrendered, the Shandong Communist army arbitrarily destroyed railways, factories, mines, schools, and other institutions. Chairman He Siyuan recently issued another statement saying: When Japan surrendered, I immediately ordered all troops in the province to first control the city walls, protect transportation, industry, and mining, and gather troops to rush to Jinan for a swift takeover. Unexpectedly, the Communist army launched a fierce attack on our takeover troops and wantonly destroyed cities, industry, commerce, transportation lines, mines, etc. The extent of the destruction is unprecedented in previous years, especially the railway. At the same time, the Communist army is actively expanding its army in order to gain internal chaos, and all men between the ages of fifteen and fifty have been forcibly enlisted. Recently, even children as young as twelve and women between the ages of fifteen and twenty-two have been conscripted into the army. Wherever the Communist army goes, young men and women flee together. Our troops' residences are overcrowded. According to a recent survey in Jinan alone, the schools in various places have been destroyed by the Communist army, and the number of young people who have lost their studies and come to Jinan has reached ten thousand. The number in Qingdao is about five thousand or more. Although this government has done its best to order schools to increase the number of classes and set up remedial classes, it is still difficult to accommodate them. In the past month, nearly 100,000 refugees have fled to Jinan. As the weather gradually turns cold, they are like beggars. The refugees are lingering in the streets, and the situation is very pitiful. This government has launched a fundraising committee organized by all sectors of society and charitable organizations, and has set up five relief stations in the city. According to the minimum calculation, about 150 million yuan is needed. If relief stations are set up universally along the transportation lines, at least 2.7 billion yuan will be needed. In addition, due to the Communist army's blockade of materials and destruction of transportation, the industry and commerce are depressed, and factories have stopped working. As a result, more than 50,000 workers in Jinan City are unemployed. In the Zichuan, Boshan, and Zhangdian mining areas, the coal mining machinery was destroyed by the Communist army, and the workers' dormitories were burned down by the Communist army. More than 100,000 workers are unemployed. In the Zaozhuang, Dawenkou, Xintai, and Laiwu mining areas, more than 120,000 workers are unemployed and are waiting for immediate relief, which has become the most serious problem at present. As for the vast rural areas, the able-bodied men are threatened, and the plows and vehicles are taken away. Even if they are recovered, it will be difficult to restore their vitality in a short time. The loss of eight years of Japanese control is not as terrible as the loss of three months. The various railways, bridges, and culverts have never been as badly damaged as they are today since they were built. The sleepers were burned, the rails were raised and the roadbed was flattened, and even ditches were dug. The poles, wires, stations, and various equipment were all destroyed. Taking railway equipment alone, in these months, it has been repaired and destroyed, repaired and destroyed. According to recent statistics, its value has reached more than 4 billion yuan. The equipment of industrial and mining enterprises has been destroyed by more than 12 billion yuan. The construction of the country for decades with countless manpower and material resources is now destroyed by the Communist army in one fell swoop, which is really heartbreaking. This is only the tangible loss that can be seen. As for the intangible loss suffered by various aspects as a result, it cannot be counted.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Company Will Gradually Be Transformed into Private Operation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that after the articles of association of the China Textile Construction Company were approved by the Executive Yuan, Minister Weng concurrently served as chairman of the board of directors and convened a board meeting. President Song personally attended the meeting and gave guidance, solemnly explaining that the government still focuses on private operation for light industry. Therefore, the business term of this company is only set for two years so that it can be transferred in time. However, because there are a large number of Japanese and puppet textile equipment, it must be quickly taken over and resumed work. Therefore, this company will be responsible for the matter first. The method of transferring to private operation was discussed. It was decided that the company should estimate the value of the assets of the Japanese and puppet textile factories as soon as possible, and after the company has been established for one year, it will specify the number of shares based on the head office and branch offices, and sell stocks. All people of the Republic of China nationality can purchase them. After the stocks are sold to more than 50%, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to change to commercial operation. Before the company is changed to commercial operation, the company's business operations will pay the taxes and duties that should be paid to the government according to the same regulations as private textile factories.</p>

<h3>After Marshall's Arrival, the US Announces China Policy; US Troops to Withdraw Upon Completion of Surrender Mission</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman announced today that the US Marine Corps stationed in China will be withdrawn to the United States upon completion of matters related to the Japanese surrender. The full US policy toward China will be announced after his special envoy, General Marshall, arrives in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Lieutenant General Van Fleet, Commander of US Overseas Forces, wrote to Republican Senator Brewster today, stating that US troops are under orders to fulfill their obligations to China, an allied nation, to end the war against Japan, and to assist in the disarmament of Japanese troops in China. This mission is currently underway, and it is anticipated that US troops will not remain in China after the mission is completed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] According to news last night, US troops will remain in North China for several more months, unless Marshall can bring about an agreement between the Nationalists and Communists as soon as possible, in which case a different outcome may occur. According to diplomatic sources, the earliest date for US troop withdrawal is after April or May. It is official US policy that US troops will remain in China until all Japanese troops have withdrawn from China. According to reports, there are still 325,000 Japanese troops in North China between the Yellow River and the Great Wall, and 1.3 million Japanese troops in Taiwan and throughout China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Former US Ambassador to China, Hurley, stated that the recent review of the outline of US policy toward China has shown a positive influence, and this public announcement can also help General Marshall, after he takes office, to promote unity among all parties and factions in China to build a strong, unified, and democratic government. Hurley stated that the announcement of this policy was caused by "controversy," which clearly refers to the uproar caused by his sudden resignation on November 27.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 12th] Representative Rogers, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, recently requested that the House conduct another investigation into US foreign policy and the reasons for the resignation of former Ambassador to China Hurley, stating that such a review is indeed necessary to find out whether US foreign policy has been undermined. When Mrs. Rogers expressed her opinion, the House received a report from Secretary of State Byrnes stating: "I have heard nothing about undermining our policy toward China."</p>

US Secretary of State Byrnes, accompanied by Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far East Department, Mr. Cohen, Advisor to the State Department, Dr. Conant, President of Harvard University and an atomic issues expert, Mr. Bohlen, an expert on Soviet affairs, and Colonel Kelly of the Army Department, departed from the National Airport yesterday on a C-54 giant transport plane to Moscow.

British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to fly to Moscow on the morning of the 14th with Mr. Bennett, Director of the Far East Department, and is expected to stay in Berlin for several hours or overnight, but it is not yet certain whether he will meet with Mr. Byrnes first. In addition, Mr. Charles, Second Secretary of the US Embassy in Iran, will represent Mr. Murray, the US Minister to Iran, at the meeting. British Ambassador to Iran Bullard has already set off from Tehran. The presence of the directors of the Far East Departments of both the US and Britain at the Moscow meeting is sufficient to show that the meeting will focus on the Far East issue. Although China and France will not be attending, the content and decisions of the meeting will be notified to the two allied nations. Truman announced yesterday that the third meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will be held in Washington in March or April next year, as stipulated during the Yalta Conference.

[Reuters, London, 13th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and a number of experts will depart from London tomorrow morning to fly to Moscow to attend the foreign ministers' meeting. The delegation includes Sir Cadogan (Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), Sir Campbell (Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), Mr. Penner (Director of the Far East Department of the Foreign Office), Mr. Walter (Director of the Reconstruction Department of the Foreign Office), and General Jacob (Representative of the Chief of the General Staff). No scientists are accompanying the British delegation. Regarding the atomic issue, Bevin will consult with Sir Campbell and Sir Cadogan, as the former is a member of the Washington Atomic Bomb Committee and the latter is a member of the Atomic Exploration Committee chaired by Sir Anderson. Although there is no formal agenda for the Moscow meeting, the list of the British delegation indicates a wide range of topics for discussion. Sir Lumley, who is traveling to Moscow as the secretary of the delegation, is a key member of the Western Department of the Foreign Office and is familiar with French affairs. Mr. Hyde, Director of the Southern Department of the Foreign Office, is also in the delegation. If the issue of the situation in the Balkan satellite countries is raised during the meeting, as Washington has proposed, he can provide Bevin with qualified opinions. British Ambassador to Iran Bullard will join the delegation in Moscow. The British delegation will spend a night in Berlin on Friday, at which time Bevin will meet with Sir Strang, the British political representative to the Allied Control Council, and General Robertson, Deputy to Field Marshal Montgomery.</p>

<h3>The British House of Commons Debates the Loan Agreement; Britain Wins the War But Ends Up in Debt; The Financial Secretary Urges Parliament to Approve It Quickly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] When the British House of Commons debated the loan agreement and the Bretton Woods Agreement yesterday, Financial Secretary Dalton stated that the price of Britain's participation in the war was acquiring a large amount of debt, so it had no choice but to borrow from other countries to maintain financial stability. At the beginning of the war, Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves were approximately 600 million pounds, but by April 1941, only 3 million pounds remained. Although Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves had increased to 450 million pounds by October 31 of this year, foreign debt had also risen to 3.5 billion pounds. Yesterday, the government requested the Parliament to approve the Anglo-American loan, and at the same time, it requested approval of the Bretton Woods Agreement to establish an international monetary reserve fund and an international bank for reconstruction. In addition, it proposed the establishment of an international trade organization.

<h3>Editorial: Government Comfort and People's Appeals</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang arrived in Peiping on the 11th, and on the 12th, he announced that the people were allowed to express their sufferings. Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, two central officials, were ordered to comfort the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. They flew to Shanghai on the 11th, and at the tea party at Kang Le Restaurant yesterday, they extended their warmth to the citizens. Representatives from all walks of life were able to speak frankly and without concealment, expressing their wishes. This is a happy event that deserves special mention recently.</p>
<p>The government and the people are originally one body. The government cannot be separated from the people, and the people cannot abandon the government. The government should understand the suffering of the people, and the people should also know the difficulties of the government. Originally, the task of the national revolution was at least to relieve the suffering of the people, and its ultimate goal was to build a free and equal new China. Difficulties and obstacles were also expected by the general public. However, since the Anti-Japanese War, the national government moved westward, and the central authorities and the compatriots in the recovered areas were separated for eight years, far apart from each other. Although they cared and missed each other, it was not as easy to communicate up and down as usual. At the beginning of the Japanese surrender, the takeover work in various recovered areas once caused some misunderstandings and disputes. In fact, half of it was due to the uneven quality of the takeover personnel, and half of it was due to the long separation and lack of understanding. As long as the people can speak honestly and responsibly, and the government can work hard with an open mind, the people's likes and dislikes will not be difficult to become the government's criteria for reform, and the government will still be afraid of not having the people as its backing? We are very happy to hear that government officials have come to comfort the people, and especially to receive the telegram from Chairman Chiang's personal visit to Peiping allowing appeals. This is the central government's remembrance of the recovered areas. This is the government's attention to the people. This is even more auspicious and harmonious for the government and the people to be united.</p>
<p>Government comfort seems to be just a verbal job, but in fact, how can it be just a verbal job? The fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts in the recovered areas have suffered the poison of the enemy and the oppression of the traitors for eight years. The long night is endless, and every day is like a year. Their mental suffering is truly unspeakable. They fully expected that once the day dawned, they could see the light of day again. Who knew that although the light was seen, the mist had not dissipated. Due to excessive expectations, they unconsciously blamed too much. The central government understands the hidden feelings, so there is comfort. The intention of comfort should not be limited to verbal explanation. We believe that Chairman Chiang and the central officials will be able to explore the true public opinion, and resolutely and decisively eradicate the evils and appease the good people from the people's preferences. As long as the government distinguishes right from wrong and rewards and punishes clearly, the people will definitely support the government's facilities wholeheartedly. This is a rigorous reality and the most ideal. Such comfort can truly benefit every old person and never forget the central government's kindness.</p>
<p>Conversely, if we want the government's comfort to truly benefit the people's actual lives, we must first look back at whether our people have the qualifications to receive comfort, and whether they can truthfully and without any increase or decrease express their own sufferings. The country and the nation have suffered a great disaster, fought bloody battles for eight years, and only then have they won. Countless people have been displaced, decapitated, and broken arms. During this period, if they only know how to be cunning and self-interested, and make a fortune from the national disaster, and then make a fortune from the victory, and even do not hesitate to collude with the enemy and oppress the people, such people, even if they are not all punished for a while, should also feel ashamed, how can they transform themselves and mix with the honest and kind old people to receive comfort together? Secondly, since the government has allowed the people to express their sufferings, we the people must, as Chairman Chiang said, have the courage and insight to speak out directly, except for those who make false accusations with malice or create sensationalism. The Chinese people often have a weakness: they are unwilling to argue when they are wronged, and they dare not speak out when they are harassed, thinking that "suffering a loss is a gain," and the people dare not offend the government. "Only state officials are allowed to set fires, and the people are not allowed to light lamps." The people are silent, and the state officials naturally act recklessly. Little do they know that the national government is by no means an autocratic government, and the national government will never "protect each other," and the harassing officials, soldiers, and police will not be allowed to survive in broad daylight. The people, after reading Chairman Chiang's announcement after his visit to Peiping, should know that they have their own responsibilities. They swallow their tears into their stomachs when they are wronged; they blame their own bitter fate when they are harassed. How can such people create a democratic country? Now the government has a democratic style and tries its best to let us speak responsibly. If the people still do not speak out in detail, and do not present the specific facts of being wronged and harassed, and ask for punishment, who can they blame!</p>
<p>In short, we hope that from now on, the government will have measures to comfort the people at any time and any place, and the people will also have the right to appeal to the government at any time and any place until the suffering is completely relieved.</p>

<h3>Chairman Concerned About People's Suffering, Deeply Hopes Shanghai Citizens Will Appeal</h3>
<p>Various Circles Welcome Ye and Niu, Two Comfort Ambassadors, Yesterday</p>
<p>Mayor Qian Dajun specially invited representatives from various groups and the public in this city, as well as the heads of party, government, and military agencies, to a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. to welcome Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, the specially appointed comfort envoys from the central government to comfort Shanghai. Over five hundred people were present, including Shen Gongzhan, Xu Jiguang, Du Yuedi, Wang Xiaohuan, Wu Shaoshu, He Dekui, Cheng Cangbo, Xuan Tiewu, Shen Shihua, Li Jilan, Feng Youzhen, Guo Yunguan, Zhao Zukang, Wang Yansong, Yu Songyun, Zha Liangjian, Qin Runqing, Gu Yuxiu, Zhang Yiwan, Yu Zuoting, Jin Runxiang, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Suzhong, Pan Xulun, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Shiquan, Luo Qinghua, Lu Jingshi, Chen Xunyu, Pu Zhengdong, Xu Caicheng, Qian Jianqiu, Mao Zipei, Wang Xinheng, Sun Qinchi, and Kui Yanfang.</p>
<p>Ye Chucang Hopes to Hear Public Opinion</p>
<p>Mayor Qian delivered an introductory speech, followed by a speech by Comfort Envoy Ye Chucang, who said that when Chucang and others left Chongqing, the Chairman instructed, "You must listen to the people more on this trip. I am deeply concerned about the people of Southeast China. You must listen clearly to the sufferings of the people of Southeast China." Today, I saw in the newspaper that the Chairman went to Peiping and set up a petition box at the headquarters, so that the people's opinions can be put into the box so that the Chairman can understand and solve them one by one. Chucang and others are here and do not want to talk too much, but want to ask everyone to talk more. Chucang and others are the petition box, and hope that everyone will express their opinions and report them to the central government as much as possible. Chucang and others hope that everyone's opinions will be realized one by one, except for those that cannot be realized due to difficulties. A veteran of the Jiangsu Revolution once talked about how after a major change, it would take a considerable amount of time to sort things out. During the Xinhai Revolution, the great changes in the country and society were only in the political aspect, and the economy was not affected. The destruction of this war was ten times that of the Xinhai era, and the economic damage was great, so we should pay more attention to economic recovery. Our task will not be completed until all the opinions you provide are implemented. Today is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai States the Hopes of the Business Community</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech, saying that the Chairman is concerned about the price of goods in Shanghai and has often asked Mr. Du Yuesheng to assist the government in finding ways to stabilize prices, which have gradually fallen and are now stable. It is hoped that the scope of private and state-owned enterprises will be determined as soon as possible. It is also hoped that the various property rights will be quickly determined. The enemy and puppet property should be sealed and disposed of by the government, and the people's property should also be returned quickly. The people also hope to subsidize the original factories so that they have the opportunity to revive. In addition, the most important task of winning over the people is to enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, it is hoped that the central government will quickly deal with the communist rebellion, otherwise the country will be unimaginable. We the people unanimously support the central government in making a decisive decision to quell the civil unrest.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life Continue to Express Their Sufferings</p>
<p>(1) Bank Representative Xu Jiquan took the floor and reported on the silver group of underground workers in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War and his own assistance to the government in stabilizing the Shanghai financial situation, saying that in the future construction work of our country, the following points should be noted: (1) Stabilize the people's livelihood, (2) Increase production, (3) Consolidate finance, (4) Revive the economy. To revive China, we must first revive Shanghai. To revive Shanghai, we must first revive the economy.</p>
<p>(4) Education Representative Jin Tongyin said that the problem of students dropping out of school has not been completely resolved. He hoped that the central government would increase education funding as much as possible and improve the lives of teachers so that teachers can teach with peace of mind and students also have the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>(3) Student Representative Chen Musheng said that 918 victims have been registered. He hoped that the central government would (a) give the greatest encouragement and guidance to young students who are working hard to participate in national reconstruction and rehabilitation; (b) cultivate talents for reconstruction and rehabilitation. It is hoped that the central government will issue a concrete training plan so that young people have a correct way to serve the country and create a new China based on the Three Principles of the People; (c) hope to have correct leadership in the student movement to assist the party and government in carrying out rehabilitation work.</p>
<p>(4) Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union made four suggestions: (a) Anti-Japanese workers are now unemployed, and it is hoped that the central government will provide relief; (b) After the victory, the enemy and puppet factories were shut down, and the number of unemployed workers suddenly increased by 300,000. Only one-tenth of the factories have resumed work, which has made the unemployment problem of workers extremely serious. It is hoped that the government will provide universal relief.</p>
<p>(5) Farmer Representative Hou Junren said that he hoped that the government would seriously investigate the losses in rural areas and provide practical relief. Special attention must be paid to rural education and the cultivation of talents must be stepped up.</p>
<p>(6) Qian Jianqiu, a representative of the Women's Association, said that she hoped that the central government would pay more attention to supporting the women's movement in the future.</p>
<p>Inspector Cheng Pays Attention to Local Finance</p>
<p>Then, Ye Chucang introduced Cheng Zhongxing, the central government's long-term eyes and ears in Shanghai, Inspector Cheng, who stood up and delivered a speech, presenting four points of the report of what he had seen and heard in Shanghai in the past three months: (1) The takeover problem has been going on for four months, and there are still unsatisfactory places. Researching the crux of the problem, the first is that there was no overall plan at the beginning, the second is that the powers and responsibilities were not clearly divided, and the third is that the takeover personnel were too unskilled. (2) On the issue of local politics, after the establishment of the Inspectorate in Shanghai, it received many complaints, most of which were accusations against the county magistrates and the executive bureaus, accusing them of arbitrarily arresting people and arbitrarily apportioning funds. The people's lives and property were not protected. The reason is that the two special envoys should report to the central government that the central government has paid too little attention to local finance in the recovered areas. The counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway need to spend 20 to 30 million yuan per month, while the income is only 4 to 5 million yuan, and even the local education funds are not available, so many problems arise. Now the most important thing is to tighten local spending on the one hand and solve local financial difficulties on the other. (3) The problem of military discipline is extremely serious. The Chairman cannot go to every small county and town to inspect, and the people and officials dare not speak. (4) The five powers of the Five-Power Constitution are extremely important in local politics. The most basic issue in rectifying local politics is to give full play to the effectiveness of the five powers, which is also the minimum requirement of the people.</p>
<p>Niu Yongjian Hopes to Be Informed in Writing</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Qian again asked Comfort Envoy Niu Yongjian to deliver a speech, saying that the report stated that Chairman Chiang had an opinion box in Peiping, hoping that the people would submit their opinions as much as possible to explore the people's feelings. This is very important. Everyone must inform us in writing, and we will report to the central government in detail in the future for selection. We deeply hope that the people's feelings can be communicated to complete our mission and help the cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Mayor Indicates that Winter Defense and Security Are Not Worried</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Qian reported on the security of the city and municipal facilities, saying that he was willing to briefly report on the things he was in charge of in his position: A. The security of the city, the number of police officers is gradually increasing, and the garrison of troops has also been determined. The number of theft cases has been gradually decreasing since December. The winter defense period is coming soon, and there is absolutely no need to worry about security, which can be comforting to the people of the city. B. Municipal facilities. There are thousands of things to do about municipal construction plans. The way to implement them should be gradually implemented according to the urgency. Now I would like to put forward two points and ask you for advice: (1) After the clean-up campaign was implemented, I often went to various places to inspect, and I often saw very well-built lanes with a lot of garbage accumulated. The high-class residents of the city do not know how to pay attention to cleanliness, and do not report to the Health Bureau and apply for removal. This is something I cannot understand. (2) If a theft case occurs in the city, it should be reported to the nearby police station immediately, and there should be no scruples. I am responsible for the local security and strictly prohibit the illegal behavior of villains. Once it is verified, it will be severely dealt with. As for the subordinates, I have repeatedly told them that if there are one or two derelict personnel, they have been severely punished after verification. I am afraid that my eyes and ears are not complete, and I deeply hope that local groups and all citizens will assist as much as possible so that the implementation of administrative orders can proceed smoothly. The welcome tea party ended in warm applause at about 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Ningbo: Letter Requesting Rectification of Land Reclamation in the Lake</p>
<p>[Dagong Agency] Dongqian Lake in Yin County has more than one million mu of fields, which are relied upon for irrigation. During the Anti-Japanese War, part of it was blocked and reclaimed for farming. Citizens of the county, including Wang Gongyu, believing that this matter concerns the water conservancy of three counties and the food of seven districts, sent letters to the Ningbo Association and relevant parties, requesting rectification.</p>
<p>Dangtu: Puppet Infantry Brigade Disarmed in Dangtu.

<h3>Social Services: Public Benevolence Villa Solicits Donations</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuji</p>
<p>The Public Benevolence Villa has been in operation for 32 years, providing burial services for the exposed dead, providing coffins, medical consultations, and establishing charity schools. Its achievements are remarkable. All expenses are dependent on donations from all sectors of society. Recently, with the arrival of winter, the number of beggars dying on the streets due to hunger and cold has been increasing daily. The corpses of prisoners sent by the court are often ordered to be coffined and buried, and the huge cost is conceivable. The stock of materials for coffins is limited, and if they are not purchased and manufactured quickly, it will be impossible to cope. Therefore, a meeting was held yesterday to discuss and decide to invite famous performers and opera singers to broadcast and solicit donations at the Jiancheng Radio Station on the upper floor of No. 60 Glock Road on the 15th and 16th of this month. The radio station has agreed to provide its services free of charge. It is hoped that listeners will be charitable and generous in donating large sums of money to support this good cause.</p>
<h3>Government Loans to Various Factories, First Batch About 900 Million Yuan, Subject to Strict Investigation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding rumors that Shenxin and other factories have obtained huge loans from the central financial authorities, our reporter specifically visited a relevant authority in Ying yesterday to inquire about the truth. It is said that there are many textile factories in this city that urgently need loan assistance, and the amount of loans is not as large as rumored. It is rumored that the amount of the first batch of loans is about 900 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications, which is responsible for the mission of developing national industry, is handling the loans. Beforehand, each factory must undergo strict investigation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to determine whether its products are urgently needed by society, whether it is difficult to obtain raw materials for the products, and whether the factory's organization is sound, before deciding whether to provide assistance. Therefore, it is expected that more than just the five Shenxin factories will receive loans. In addition, the factories that the Ministry of Economic Affairs approves for assistance will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review, and then sent to the Shanghai Branch of the Joint Treasury for final decision by the Joint Treasury Headquarters in Chongqing. It is rumored that the first batch of loan plans was submitted to the Joint Treasury Headquarters two weeks ago and should be approved soon. The approved amount of loans will be proportionally shared by the three banks and two bureaus, and the Bank of Communications will handle the loan procedures. Short-term emergency loan methods will generally not deviate from acceptance discounting and mortgage lending. The highest monthly interest rate on loans is 3.6%, and once the industrial situation improves, construction of the financial and capital markets will begin to guide the entire industry towards healthy development.</p>

<h3>Music Education Movement</h3>
<p>— Song ShouChang</p>
<p>Most people think that music can make people happy and comfortable in body and mind, and comfort their spirits, so they regard it as a noble form of entertainment. In fact, the relationship between music and humans is not only on this aspect, it is deeper than entertainment. Because music has a subtle effect, it can change personality, cultivate temperament, and enable human life to improve, so it can also be used as a tool to educate society.</p>
<p>The direct effects on personality change can be roughly divided into three aspects: morality, religion, and art. Among them, morality is achieved through the influence of the personality of great men; religion is obtained through faith in God; art is implemented through direct contact with emotions. The three methods of changing personality are different, but morality and religion cultivate personality by relying on great men and gods, while music directly touches personality with emotion, and its influence is naturally more practical and powerful than morality and religion. If we want to cultivate our temperament and complete our personality, music is indispensable. This fact has been recognized by scholars in the East and West.</p>
<p>Confucius of our country was in the chaotic Spring and Autumn Period. In order to save the people's hearts at that time, he advocated rituals and music. He said: "Be based in poetry, establish in rituals, and complete in music." In Confucius' view, the significance of music is very important. It is not only to educate individuals, but also to govern the country. Western Greek philosophers such as Plato advocated using music to cultivate temperament; Aristotle said that music is a means of pleasant cultivation. The European and American countries today also regard noble music as a necessary item for character cultivation. These are all facts that music is used as a tool to cultivate moral character and cultivate beautiful emotions.</p>
<p>The ancient sages and sages of our country also advocated emphasizing music in governing the country, because rituals are used to regulate external behaviors in life, and music is to regulate the inner spirit. In other words, rituals are formal, and music is spiritual. Xunzi said in his essay on music: "In terms of behavior, music can broaden the will, make the appearance dignified, the ranks correct, and the advances and retreats orderly... It can make the ears and eyes sharp, the mind and heart peaceful, change customs and habits, and make the world peaceful." In his view, rituals and music are mutually dependent. Where the power of rituals is insufficient, music can be used to complete its effect.</p>
<p>The relationship between rituals and music is so close. I hope that in the sound of advocating a new life, we will actively carry out the music education movement.</p>
<h3>Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>A Historical Short Story</p>
<p>The early summer evening was gorgeous, the sky was a brilliant blue, with clouds of light yellow, light red, and purple, so evenly and harmoniously matched. Jing Ke was walking on the edge of the market, looking up at the sky for a while, then suddenly lowered his head and sighed. He seemed to have a bellyful of depression that he couldn't express.</p>
<p>Just as he walked into the street and was about to turn the corner, Tian Guang came walking towards him. Tian Guang was hunched over, his face also gloomy. He was old and walked with some difficulty, but he still looked strong. When Jing Ke saw him, he hurried forward and said:</p>
<p>"Scholar Tian, I haven't seen you for a few days, why do you look so worried?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we all have such a mood, your face doesn't look good either."</p>
<p>Jing Ke couldn't help but smile, but it was a bleak, bitter smile. He immediately asked, "What is the definitive news about the Qin state sending troops to attack Qi and Chu?"</p>
<p>"Our Yan state is certainly in danger. The King of Han has already been captured. Qin troops are attacking Qi to the south and Zhao to the north. The fate of Yan state is very terrible. It seems too late now to 'unite vertically'."</p>
<p>"That's the sentence, 'uniting vertically' is too late," Jing Ke said. "Then what is the scholar's opinion?"</p>
<p>Tian Guang sighed infinitely, saying, "I am old and weak and incompetent. Although I am eager to serve the country, what can I do? Today, Prince Dan actually discussed the country's major plans with me. I did not presume to recommend you. Please go to see the prince tomorrow. I think the prince will definitely value you."</p>
<p>"It is a soldier's duty to serve the country with his life," Jing Ke said passionately and generously. Tian Guang stared at him deeply for a while, and moved, he stretched out his right hand and patted Jing Ke's shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Then let it be! The survival of Yan depends on you brave men who are willing to sacrifice."</p>
<p>Jing Ke watched the old man walk away before turning to leave. He was still thinking about how he would see Prince Dan the next day. The country is in such a critical situation, and the tyrannical Qin State does not need much strength to destroy several small countries. Now that there is no chance for the small countries to unite, we must think of the most direct and effective way to save Yan from the imminent disaster.</p>
<p>He walked and thought like this. He had already reached the entrance of a small wine shop, a place where Jing Ke often came to drink. Today, he happened to meet Gao Jianli drinking here. He raised his head and saw Gao Jianli and the dog butcher both holding wine glasses and drinking heartily. A large bowl of steaming dog meat was placed on the table. It must have been that the dog butcher had killed a fat dog today, and the boss's wife had cooked it in advance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Cultural Association Branch to Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>According to news from Chongqing, the Shanghai Branch of the Literary and Art Association, since Xia Yan came to Shanghai to launch it and announced a public letter supporting the reorganization, has matured after several gatherings and can be established in mid-month. It is heard that Zheng Zhenduo, a veteran of the orthodox literary world, will preside over it.</p>
<p>The deputy supplement of the Chongqing version of the Peace Daily is now edited by Wang Pingling. The Shanghai version is also internally determined to be Feng Hezi (Feng Zi) combined with Xie Bingying for the Han version, a quite strong lineup.</p>
<p>Xie Bingxin, due to a publishing dispute over "About Women," recently told reporters: "It is difficult not to write, and it is difficult to write. What should I do?"</p>
<p>Zhang Henshui is still living at No. 23 Taozigou, South Hot Spring, Chongqing, and has no intention of going to Peiping or Shanghai for the time being. A certain large newspaper in Shanghai that will soon be published is currently negotiating with him for a long novel. (Meng Yun)</p>

<p>Pen-Tip Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Don't Be an Inheritor of Crimes</h3>
<p>— Wu RenZhi</p>
<p>During the war, the enemy and puppets occupied many public and private properties of our people. These properties have been taken over by various government agencies at the same time as enemy and puppet properties. Because they were taken over separately, the situation was quite chaotic at the beginning. After several high-ranking officials came and made several adjustments and unifications over the past three months, the handling mechanism has gradually been put on track. However, the receivers, custodians, and even the current users still do not feel the need to be dealt with urgently in their minds and actions. They only know that things received from the enemy and puppets should be subject to the same fate. They do not distinguish between enemy public property, enemy private property, puppet public property, puppet private property, or property seized by the enemy and puppets. This serious mistake is enough to cause people's complaints, resentment, and even exceed the emotions of complaining and hating the enemy and puppets in the past. Why? People expected to be occupied by the enemy and puppets, but the current encounters are unexpected, so the resentment is deep.</p>
<p>If a bandit robs the people's things, and you drive away the bandit and recover the stolen goods for the people, the people will of course be very grateful to you. But if you think that "this thing was taken from the bandit by me, of course I will use it," or come up with a way to "let me use it for a while and then talk about it," even the most docile people will probably complain and hate you!</p>
<p>I am afraid that there are many such things. In the eyes of someone like me with a very small range of social contact, there are two cases: One is the school building of XX Middle School, watching others use it, and there is no hope of recovering it, but instead borrowing houses elsewhere to start school. One is the XX Grand Theater (originally the property of a British-籍 Chinese XX), which was taken over by a handwritten note and turned into a movie theater. What culture, what school education, what drama movement, these theories that have long been regarded as insignificant, we will not talk about them for the time being. But this is not enemy property, not puppet property, this is the school property of the people, the private property of allied nationals. The former occupation was the crime of the enemy and puppets! Now inheriting and using it, we should consider not becoming an inheritor of crimes!</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Powerful Players Continue to Acquire, Gold Prices Rise Continuously</h3>
<p>Gasoline Payment Stimulates Buying Interest</p>
<p>Yesterday, the shorts tried to fight to the death, continuing to put pressure on the market. The opening price fell from 685,000 to 672,000. When the chips were exhausted, retail investors absorbed them at lower prices. After that, it revolved upward. Banks from the Northern Gang and Sichuan Gang came to buy, and then broke through the 700,000 mark. A certain short firm added to its position, and the floating longs sold off. After that, the longs and shorts fought each other with all their might inside and outside the 700,000 mark. Until noon, they were still struggling around 690,000. Later, the Jin and Gan gangs continued to add, and the 700,000 mark was firmly established. At the same time, rumors spread that the exchange rate against the US dollar was fixed at 1,500, so it rose sharply. Although there were some twists and turns due to the banks throwing out at high prices, the result was that because the US dollar was extremely scarce, the red finished at the highest price, an increase of 35,000 compared with the previous close. The trend is to move forward courageously and continue to move forward. It can be seen that the banks are constantly absorbing gold in the gold market, and the chips have been swept into the hands of powerful players. This newspaper has repeatedly mentioned that various unreasonable speculations in the market, discussions after drinking and eating, are fabricated out of thin air, and there is no factual proof. On the contrary, gasoline payments are not only above the free market price, but also exceed the church exchange rate by a lot. Therefore, there is a rumor of 1,500 to 1 this afternoon. In fact, an excessively low exchange rate will cause domestic factories to be on the verge of bankruptcy, and an excessively high exchange rate is not welcomed by the Allied side. Everything should wait for the authorities to decide carefully. Therefore, after the surge, it is feared that it will turn into consolidation. The high price of gold jewelry in silver shops is 78,000, the price of silver is still 600 yuan, the price of silver dollars is about 430, and the discount rate is still between 10 cents and 12 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: The US dollar was always firm yesterday under the manufacturers' cash-out purchase. The lowest was 1,075 yuan, and then it gradually pulled up. By noon, it had broken through the 1,100 yuan mark. Gasoline payments continued to be paid today, and the closing price was about 1,425 yuan (the legal tender price of 400 yuan per 28 cents of US dollar). There were rumors in the market that the exchange rate against the US dollar was set at 1,500 to 1. The buying interest in the US dollar, which was already in short supply, was further stimulated, and the price soared, closing at the peak, an increase of 70 yuan compared with the previous close, and the buying trend is still rampant, and the asking price is still increasing. Hong Kong dollars are limited by the environment, although they are firm, they still feel constrained. As a result, the old goods are 10 yuan better than the previous close, and the new goods are 2 yuan better. Australian pounds are worth about 2.6 US dollars, and rupees are 27 or 28 cents.</p>
<p>Securities: The public bond market was confused yesterday, with many twists and turns in the middle. Although it was once pulled up due to the activity of buyers at the end, the result was still softer than the previous close. However, Class D bonds rose slightly, and the difference continued to narrow. The market for foreign stocks was sluggish because the market closed earlier. As a result, large stocks fell slightly compared with the previous close, while small stocks rose slightly.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: The rice market is stable in both sales and consumption. The situation is stable, and Zhongguan has risen slightly by one or two hundred yuan. The same is true for flour. Oil prices have become more active due to the transfer of store sales to stocks, and have rebounded by one or two thousand yuan. The soybean market has become a stagnant market. Raw peanuts are sold as soon as they arrive, and the rise and fall are uncertain. Bean cake is fair, and cotton cake is sluggish due to the recent decline in fuel prices.</p>
<p>Yarn Market: It continues to see a surge, because gold prices have repeatedly increased, and there are rumors of more favorable foreign exchange. Therefore, the customer gang's buying interest has increased, and the price has gradually increased. 16-count Guangming yarn opened at 270,000 and gradually rose to 300,500. The closing price of 20-count ordinary goods rose from 380,000 to 400,000, both of which increased by 40,000 compared with Saturday. There is demand for fine yarn and thread, but holders are hoarding and not releasing them, so the rise is even more fierce, rising by about 60,000 to 70,000. The trend is still prosperous, but it must be supported by gold prices and actual sales.</p>
<p>Wool: The factory's production is pending, and it takes time to import foreign goods. As a result, the inventory of better old-fashioned fine wool is lacking in the same industry, but sales have also decreased due to environmental factors. It has become a situation of both supply and demand shortage. It is difficult to increase the price, and it is difficult to fall. If the transportation becomes smooth one day, and the customer gang starts to search and handle it, the future is still more promising.</p>
