<h3>共同聲明原文</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　二十三日於東京召開之大東亞大使會議，通過共同聲明如次：</p>
<p>大東亞各國對於英美無　之侵略，為互相提携解放英美桎梏下之大東亞，並完成其自存自榮計，克服一切艱難，向共同完遂戰爭途上邁進，以至今日，然英美以强力壓迫各中立國，作為其戰爭之工具，藉名解放他國，實則恣意擴大勢力範圍，干涉各閱內政，並對敵對各國國家之存在與民族生存基礎固不待言，即其固有之文化亦被企圖一筆抹殺。英美今日所懷抱之戰後計劃，無論以任何政治方法加以粉飾，惟其專以强力為基礎，强制擁護逞其心意之秩序，此種野心，終難掩飾。英美圖將國際政治置於其專制之下，而妄欲担常全世界之警察任務，更策動壟斷世界之經濟，以期與帝國主義之支配世界愈趨永久，故其他各國各民族，不能保障為生存與繁榮之公正均等地位，尤以對於大東亞各民族，仍周執偏見及差別觀念。彼我戰爭目的，絕對不相容，英美始終企圖維持强化此種不合理的國際秩序，而大東亞各國戰爭目的則在排除此種專制獨佔及差別，堅持以正義為基礎，建設眞正之秩序。大東亞各國前曾發表共同宣言，闡明大東亞戰爭之音義與目的，現因英美之暴力，國際正養與人類福祉，幾將全被蹂躪，實不容坐視，故大東並各國乃基於其共同戰爭目的，一再向中外表明為建設眞正世界秩序之指導原則。</p>
<p>七項决意　同時，對於企圖阻止破壞之英美野心，重申暫以集中總力完遂戰爭之決意。　確立國際秩序之根本基礎，應在政治平等，經濟互惠及尊重固有文化之原則下，撤廢人種等一切差別，而以親和協力為宗旨，謀共存共榮。　無論國之大小，均須保障其政治平等地位，且必須予以共同均等向上發展之機會，至於政治之形態，則任各國之所欲，而不受他國干涉。　解放處於殖民地地位之各民族，使其各得其所，開拓貢獻推展人類文明之途徑。　排除資源，通商，國際交通之壟斷，謀經濟之互助協力，以資匡正仳界經濟之不均衡，使適應於各國國民創意與勤勞之經濟，得以普遍繁榮。相互尊重各國文化之傳統，同時藉文化之交流，促進國際新和及人類之發展。　於不威脅，不侵略之原則下，排除威脅他國之軍備，芟除通問上之障礙，防止依續武力及經濟手段對他國施以壓迫或挑撥。　關於安全保障機構，則力避大國之獨斷及全世界劃一之方法，而以適合實情之地方的安全保障體制，樹立能以世界各種保障機構併用之秩序，且適應不斷進展之世界各種情勢，　開拓使國際秩序改變為和平的途徑。</p>
<h3>日鈴木首相　招待重臣</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電鈴木首相二十三日正午，在首相官邸招待平沼男爵·岡田大將·近衛公爵·柬條大將·廣田·小磯大將等重臣，作新任首相之獻詞，幷請求各重臣之協力，下午二時半散會。</p>
<h3>泰外長談話</h3>
<p>盤谷二十三日中央社電　泰國外長希賽那，頃就二十五日召開之舊金山會議發表談話稱：關於舊金山會議內容如何，雖不能逆料，惟有關大東亞者，以彼等地處太平洋之彼岸，縱使有若何議論，亦與大東亞民族不關痛癢。蓋吾人已有大東亞宜言，為東亞民族應循之途，刻戰局已臨光明時期，盟邦日本以不屈不撓之精神擊滅英美，我泰國除深表敬意外，誓以基於共同宣言，向擊滅敵人之途勇往前進。</p>

<h3>日外相及各國大使在會議席上致詞</h3>
<p>日外相致詞</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　大東亞大使會議中，日東鄕外務大臣兼大東亞大臣致詞如次：「東亞之近代央，為英美制　東亞之野心與東亞各國對此抗爭之歷史，英美等以其發達之虎器及無　之殘忍性與詭術，逐步達成其野心，而對東亞各國反復採言立不平等條約，更實行經濟榨取等政策，置東亞各民族於悲慘命運而不能自拔之境。抑夫日本　國之精神一以萬邦為國交之根本，確保東亞之安定，而期世界之和平，日本實現上述理想之前，曾為英美侵略東亞制霸世界之陰謀所阻碍。曩者，日本曾提倡廢除人種的差別，而為彼等拒絕，又英美施行其慣用之謀略於東亞各國，以致遂有不幸之中國事變發生，其後英美專意煽動東亞之禍亂，同時對日本加以軍事的，經濟的强壓，於是日本為自存自衛，解放復興東亞計，蹶然奮起，與敵人挑戰相周旋。要之，此次大東亞戰爭，乃顯示全東亞國家民族最有意義之戰爭，亦即為日本國家自存自衛之戰爭，就東亞而言，東亞十億民族解放復興之成否繫於此戰爭，就世界而言，世界正義與萬邦共榮之公正國際秩序成立與否，亦與此戰爭有關，此為日太國民所甚信者也。今日戰局極為重大，盟邦菲律賓及緬甸之一部及日本領之一部島嶼亦為敵軍所陷，日本本土亦為彼等極非人道的無差別轟炸之目的，日本忠勇無比之軍隊與勇敢之友軍將士，挺身擊毀敵軍之侵犯，而使敵軍發生極大犧牲。試觀英美陣營，彼等自負戰局已於彼等有利，頻向全世界伸展政治謀略之手段，即對中立各國蹂躪其自主獨立性，以圖擴大其勢力範圍，並實行無限之不正行為而毫無所忌。至於其戰爭之手段，不顧人類道義，專以非人道惡虐方法實行大規模之殺傷與破壞，又蔑視文明世界所依據之道義性，如斯缺乏正義觀念之英美以為即將戰捷，忙於討論戰後經營問題，彼等所謂戰後計劃，乃在全世界設立英美軍事基地，駐屯其軍隊，而以其大軍事力量包辦國際警察。至於經濟方面，擬獨佔重要資源與國際交通，並藉名國際協力，以岡壟斷英美政治經濟，榨取殖民地，壓迫後進國家，而謀英美獨自之永久繁榮。至於政治方面，標榜所謂民主主義，主張人種平等之英美意岡，其實在於獨裁國際政治，乃視其所提倡之國際安全保障機構則可明顯，即所謂安全保障者，擬以英美之協力擁護彼等自己之繁華，彼等所謂維持平等，即以榨取殖民地，對人種實行差別待遇為其原則。敵人如此野心益愈明顯之際，吾人應集合總力，堅持完遂戰爭決之意，並闡明根據大東亞各國協同信義之確立世界秩序原則乃為必需，於是由各國政府進行協議以至今日。」</p>
<p>蔡大使致詞</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央國於英美發斯之侵略桎梏社電　我國大使蔡培致辭如下：「自英美帝國主義侵略魔手伸人東亞以來，受禍最早者即為我中華民國，雅片戰爭以後，經濟侵略之毒尤為漲漫，國父孫中山先生曾於「民族主義」·「大亞洲主義」及「中國存亡問題」文中等，對其野心痛加說明，吾下，若不謀解放，則將永陷於殖民地這地位。然於近世東亞之歷史上，對英美帝國主義之壓迫與蹂躪，加以抵抗之東亞各國民族戰爭，已昭昭然現於事實，而今次之大東亞戰爭，為東亞民族解放之戰，，與盟邦諸國共同邁進，故吾等應繼汪故主席之貴故我等當傾注全力，以使此聖戰完遂。至今英美以其應大之物量，以期達成其征服世界之野心，然盟邦日木以其沉着果敢之精神，予以痛擊，其他各國亦於自國之立塲，繼續推行種種協力，故汪故主席曾昭示吾人，應以「同甘共苦·同生共死」之精神志，貫徹目的。自大東亞戰爭以來，得解放之民族，已有緬甸·菲律賓兩國，此即證明大東亞戰爭即為解放東亞民族之戰爭。大東亞戰爭，乃為大東亞諸民族對抗英美侵略主義之正義戰，同時亦可謂自衛戰。關於中國，則基於大柬亞共同宣言之五原則，實行緊密提携，集結大東亞之總力，貫徹大東亞戰爭，以圖大東亞民族得以眞正解放，藉謀世界眞正之和平，以確立世界新秩序之一環。」</p>
<p>泰大使致詞</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　泰閱大使烏基特致詞如下：「余希望本會重樹平等互惠及相互尊敬之原則，吾人倡導不拘人稱及宗敎，均應支援其獨立，並將殖民地的色彩及隸屬的關係完全肅淸，逐出在東亞天地，使敵人明瞭吾人作戰的合於正義及道義，必能獲得勝利。吾人作戰決非復仇，更非嫌惡，乃為保全吾人獨立權利以及人類地位而戰，是以吾人應作戰到底，並相信勝利必屬於我」。</p>
<p>菲大使致詞</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　菲律賓共和國大使伐爾加斯致詞如下：「我菲律賓人已成為自由的人民，但在此利己主義跋扈以及强力破壞的世界中，菲人正站於歷史上的歧途，惟余相信菲人內心常存正義與友愛之信念，余與浴勒爾同樣深信，菲律賓人必須回復東亞人的本來面目，此種任務或許需時十年甚至百年，惟大東亞宜言所啓示之諸原則必然實現，吾人之理想必可實現於新世界秩序及自由東亞之天地」。</p>
<p>王大使致詞</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　滿王大使致詞如次：「東亞之天地歷來為我大東亞民族祖先之地，有史以來業經六千餘年，相互在善隣友好，有無相通之目標下，享受自給自足之生活，因此民族榮達，民生安定，然英美兩國遠渡海洋，以圖蹂躪我十億民族，日本為大東亞民族存亡，芟除元凶，首先與英美開戰，故不僅為今日之大東亞共榮圈中之核心，且為大東亞民族國家中之先驅者。現在大東亞各國已臨重大關頭，由於日本特攻隊之出擊，使冲繩方而之敵軍蒙受重創，故最後勝利必屬我方毫無疑義。常大東亞戰爭爆發時，我皇帝陛下謂日滿二國之關係為生死存亡，絕對不可分離者，我國官民舉此帝旨，傾注物心兩方之總力，俾謀生產力之增强，是以軍需工業日愈興隆，農產物亦因近年之禾惠生產頗多，完成所謂大東兵亞站基地之任務，我國鑒於是種重大使命，願與各國共同奮鬥努力，大蔞亞十億民眾存亡鑒此一戰。日本帝國之戰爭目的，在於解放大東亞民族，大東亞諸國有鑒於此，互以赤誠相旋，向完遂戰爭一途邁進」。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>世界新形勢</h3>
<p>— 楊光政</p>
<p>—新協滬分會時事演講會講詞訂正稿　觀察世界形勢應具三種立塲：一是客觀的立塲，即根據事實以作判斷，勿憑偏見或感情，方能得到正確的結論。二是進步的立塲，關於時局的推移，勿以機械的方法而以辨證的方法去加以推斷，要明白時局的變化，其因素旣很複雜，且迂迴曲折，決非簡單之事；不過旣有變化，就有進步。三是中國的立塲，我們是中國人，所以應瞭解各種變局對中國之影響如何，及如何運用變局以達到中國之獨立·自由·平等。其次，觀察今日的時局，應有二種基本認識：第一，戰爭是政治的延長，政治的變化足以影響戰局的變化，甚至可使戰爭變質。第二，目前的大戰，乃係三角鬥爭，即軸心國家·資本主義國家·共產主義國家的鬥爭，而並非單純的兩方之戰，因此戰同的發展尤其複獲而多變化。</p>
<p>茲先言。歐洲形勢：在上月中，蘇軍已繼攻抵距柏林東北一二五哩的斯德了，正束六十呷的庫斯特林，東南七六哩的法蘭克福，與南部七○哩的勞本，對柏林形成了弧形包圍。其時西綫英美軍尙在萊茵河一帶作戰，距柏林有四百五十哩以上，德軍為保衛柏林，乃調大軍至東綫以抗蘇軍，因此英美軍得以向東推進。這時蘇軍本可直攻柏林，不料忽將其攻勢重點移至南部，襲取奧京維也納，並向捷克進發。這是為了什麼呢？其間有三大原因：　蘇軍單獨進攻柏林，勢必受到慘重犧牲，蘇聯為使英美軍分担犧牲起見，所以按兵不動；　蘇軍單獨進攻柏林，勢將激起德人對蘇更大的仇恨，此在政治上是失策；　乘英美軍尙未突入德國心贓部時，把歐洲其他地域搶入堂握。</p>
<p>近月來西錢英美軍，在北部已攻入漢堡，中北部佔領渶諾成及其東部的馬格德堡，南部攻佔萊浦齊，本可從中路直指柏林進擊，但此後英美軍却忽又製取萊浦齊東南的德萊斯登，並從霍夫突入捷克境內。迨英美軍將近柏林，蘇軍方對柏林發動大攻勢，展開對柏林的爭奪戰（據二十二日電，蘇軍已突入柏林，而美軍距柏林尙有八十呷）。這一點乃表示英美與蘇聯兩方在共同對德國作戰的同時，還在互相爭奪着歐洲的地盤，亦即爭奪着將來在歐的覇權</p>
<p>英美與蘇聯爭奪歐洲地盤，實不自今日始。去秋當蘇軍兵臨華沙城下時，忽移其攻勢於巴爾幹，囊括羅，保，南各國，而當時正在法國作戰的英軍乃亦移其一部軍隊在阿爾巴尼亞與希臘登陸，結果竟發生了希臘左翼軍與英軍的正面衝突，這是一例。再如歐戰起爆以前，英法擬促成德蘇之戰；豈料德蘇突訂協定，促成軸心國與英法之戰；嗣後德國勢力大張，蘇聯乃實行防德反德，而發生德蘇之戰。由此可見英美與蘇聯均欲消耗他國實力，以使本國擴張。現在英美蘇因對德目的相同，故而暫時聯合、假定柏林陷落，則英美與蘇聯勢將各欲樹立德國新政權，而引起傾軋。再假定歐戰結東，英美與蘇聯間消失了共同的對象與聯合的因素，則其矛盾或將復趨擴大。</p>
<p>英美蘇的矛盾，在不久召開的舊金山會議中亦可見之。如波蘭參加問題及投票權問題等，已見報載，茲不贅述。自羅斯福逝世，特魯曼升任總統後，蘇聯突改任莫洛托夫為出席舊金山會議的首席代表，此果出於美國的要求，但亦實欲由莫氏前去觀測新總統治下的美國傾向，並促使美國不改變羅斯福的政策。由此可見蘇聯對美顧忌的一斑。</p>
<p>總之，蘇聯與英美兩方國策不同，政治體制不同，利害關係亦不同，故其根本矛盾始終存在，如果矛盾擴大，就會引起紛爭。</p>
<p>次言東亞形勢：自去年十月二十日美軍在雷伊泰島登陸，直至今年二月底馬尼刺始告陷落，而菲律賓戰事至今尙在進行中。迨二月十七日，美軍復在小笠羣島中之硫黃島登陸，至三月十七日戰事結束。其後四月一日，美軍越過台灣在琉球羣島之本島即冲繩島登陸，迄今尙在激戰中，戰果已見報載，戰局頗為緊張。不過英美如欲取勝，必須進攻日本本土與中國大陸。惟在戰爭中，取攻擊的一方犧牲必大，這是一；日軍在本土及大陸上的防禦遠較外圍諸小島的防禦為積極而堅强，這是二；在現代立體戰爭中，實行登陸戰所受的損害遠較其他攻勢作戰為鉅大，這是三；從英美軍登陸義大利後蝸牛步般的推進及登陸北法後進展之緩慢，令人對於英美陸軍的作戰力發生疑問，這是四；又，此後英美軍如欲進攻日本本土，則須先攻佔日本南部的其他諸小島；若欲進攻中國大陸，則勢須攻佔杭州灣東面的舟山羣島或朝鮮南部的濟州島等。但要記得，美軍進攻菲律賓，費時四五個月尙未結束，硫黃島是一個極小的島，也費了一個多月才得佔領；今後若再深入日本內海，則日本的反擊力也更頑强。所以東亞的戰局勢將曠日持久。</p>
<p>那末蘇聯是否會在東亞協助英美出兵呢？不錯，蘇聯已通吿不延長日蘇中立條約，以換得舊金山會議中英美對蘇的讓步。但日蘇中立條約還有一年有效期，並且日本為保持甚至增進日蘇國交，已任深通蘇聯國情的東鄕為外相。所以在這一年中，日蘇關係不會惡化，並且假定歐戰結束，則促使英美蘇聯合的因素即吿消失，現實主義的史太林自更不會對於東亞問題受英美的利用。况且假如英美果能恢復其東亞的羈權，則自西歐經地中海沿岸與西南亞洲而達重慶治下的中國大陸以至於阿留申羣島與阿拉斯加，都在英美的支配下，形成了對蘇的一大包圍圈，這種形勢當非蘇聯所願見的。</p>
<p>所以假定歐戰結束，則蘇聯的態度有兩種可能：一是為了在歐戰中犧牲慘重，急求休息與復興，那末她將不干涉東亞戰爭，讓英美與日本兩方消耗下去，這樣，東亞戰爭恐將拖長下去。不過，資本主義國家與共產主義國家間的第三次大戰是遲早要爆發的，如果蘇聯意欲趁此次大戰的機會，覆滅全世界的資本主義國家，那末未始不會使第二次世界大戰變質而接着展開第三次大戰。目前日本的統制經濟以及政治上的全民動員與外次上的反帝政策，已經脫出了資本主義的性格；所以如果將業英美與蘇聯的矛盾擴大的話，那末日蘇聯合，甚至歐亞聯合以實行反帝國主義的戰爭，也未始沒有可能。那時戰爭已經變質，英美國內恐將發生階級鬥爭而引起大混亂，也未可知。</p>
<p>以上僅係推測，自不能作為定論的；不過世界形勢並非單純地成直綫推移，而將經過許多的曲折變化，方才可見結果，這是一個大致不誤的原則。在這曲折變化的世界中，中國怎樣呢？</p>
<p>百年來中國革命的目的，是在國際上求獨立，在政治上求民主，在經濟上求共生；所以我們要打倒帝國主義，剷除封建遣孽，遏止資本主義。近年來，日本因戰局吃緊，已確定了對華新政策，今後形勢再嚴重下去，日本為博得中國的協力，不能不把平等互惠的新政策逐步實踐。日本國家的性格既已變化，我們民族的敵人將為英美各帝國主義；唯有打倒一切帝國主義，才能消滅在帝國主義掩護下的封建殘餘與資本主義的勢力，才能完成中國的革命！在這一點上，中日殊有真實協力互助的必要。再則，這一次世界大混戰，使各帝國主義的勢力已因消耗而削弱，所以正是給予中國完成革命的好機會。不過我們要達到革命的目的，必須憑籍本身的力量，才有可能，所以全國人民應當團結統一起來，刻苦耐勞，共同奮鬥，以完成民族的獨立，政治的民主，和經濟的平等！</p>

<p>中部太平洋基地二十三日中央社電　日航空部隊二十日傍晚，在慶良間島南方猛攻敵大型艦船羣，另一機隊當晚轟炸北中兩機塲，一十一日夜再度空襲該機塲，投下多數炸彈。其他一機隊，在東部半島海面攻擊敵艦船，二十二日拂曉，在嘉手納海面擊沉大型輸送船一隻，自二十一日至二十二日間之日空軍奮戰情形，由陸上可望見，每次攻擊時，發生大爆發數十所，二十二日敵機來襲琉球島者有三百數十架。日機隊又於二十二日　下午，在列島東方對於敵艦隊實行攻擊。</p>
<h3>冲繩島　最近戰况</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於冲繩島最近戰况，據本市軍事觀察家消息，距那覇四英里敵美軍於二星期前條吿停頓，但自本月十九日以來，敵美軍竟又作總反攻之舉，戰况頗為激烈。在東海岸方面之美軍第七師團稍有前進趨勢，而在中央方面，敵美軍第九，第十六師團刻正遭遇日本猛烈之攻擊，敵難越雷池一步。在西海岸方面，敵美軍第二十七師團在牧港附近，敵方虛偽報道稱已佔領一部份之說，至今猶未證實，可見其報道不確。並據敵司令官發表所稱，在該島之作戰，舉凡向前進越極小一步，必須以極大之犧牲及大量之出血可換取，於此可見敵軍進展之遲緩。至冲繩島南方之湊川附近，敵以艦砲射擊，而日軍在海面上奮勇將其擊退，至冲繩島南部之作戰，最近數日來，日見激烈，此經日軍勇猛殲擊，已將敵之前進企圖粉碎。在本部半島地帶之戰况，頃已顯見激烈，一方面日本特別攻擊隊連續向敵猛烈攻擊，來犯該方面之敵軍，損失逐漸增加，尤其日本特別攻擊隊果敢殺敵，美軍極為畏懼，在敵方報道上，已極力掩蔽損失，同時，並作無謂之自炸日本土及特攻隊之根據地，當前日軍民之精神一致，戰意極為昂揚。關於伊江島上之東南高地，日軍已勇猛迎擊敵人。</p>

<h3>本期戶口粉　定日內配給　調整價格每斤四百元</h3>
<p>關於本市戶口粉配給，業經上海區粉麩統配處商請粉麥統制會决定擬發一部份，即將於日內開始繼續配給。本期配給戶口粉數址，仍為每口一市斤（二等粉），配給價格為四百元，較原有配給價格增加百分之三百。據悉此次戶口紛配給價格之調整，經粉麥會與粉麩統配處數度會商，在不增重平民負擔之合理原則下，確定調整標準。該會處等以戶口粉為一般平民必需糧食，配給價格不應隨一般物價而增高，故過去數月來，均未遽爾調整，始終保持原有配價。普因去年近多及今年開春以來，小麥收買價格一再提高，其製粉成本態增愈重，如仍照原配價，則虧蝕甚鉅，故經一再考慮，從最低標準中而重訂配似。此項配給價格調整後，戶口粉配給決繼續維持不使中斷，至於各業特種粉配給，該處亦在準備續辦。</p>

<p>榨油工業</p>
<h3>上海食油業調查</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>上海食油之來源，向以大通豆油，靑鳥生油為大宗；近以航路運輸困難，大批之油，久未到滬。目前來源有二：一為販賣商向南通·東台·泰縣·蚌埠·無錫·常州等地零星採購而來；一為由山東方面以帆船奘油至吳淞·瀏河再行轉運至滬。至蚌埠方面，產油雖豐，但因火事運輸不暢，到貨稀少。</p>
<p>戰前上海亦為榨油中心，有榨油廠二十多家，工人總數達五千以上，以其銷路言：豆油銷行全國，生油銷華南，椰十油銷本埠各肥皂廠，棉十油銷美國。以油餅言：豆餅銷廣東·厦門·油頭等處，其次則銷京滬滬杭沿綫各地；菜子餅，棉干餅，椰子餅，其主要銷路在日本，其次則銷南美各國，和現在自顧不　的情形，究全相反。</p>
<p>榨油工業</p>
<p>茲將上海各榨油廠情形，分述於次：</p>
<p>同昌油廠，廠址在南碼頭，有四十多年的歷史，為上海最老的油廠，出豆餅·棉子餅，該廠職工有一百多人，通州人佔多數，次為紹興人寗波人，蘇北人不多，已停工多時。</p>
<p>大有餘油廠，上海最大的油廠，有三十多年歷史，開全車有一千多工人，現只有百餘工人，每天可出豆油八百多斤，出　八百多塊，出棉子油八百多斤，出餅四百多擔，現因原料缺乏，生產量已大减。</p>
<p>大德新汕廠創辦未久，出品優良，有四副棉子榨，工人近一百人，每天可出油八百多斤，出餅四百多擔。</p>
<p>立德油廠創辦三十多年，工人三百餘，有棉子車十二副，椰十車四副，椰子油最有名，花子汕亦佳，但豆餅生意淸淡，變陷於停工狀態。</p>
<p>大昌油廠，最盛時有工人三百多，產豆餅。棉子餅。椰子餅等，有豆餅杯八十幾副，花子榨八副。</p>
<p>德豐油廠，有職工二百多人，只做豆餅，每天可出六千塊豆餅，有人力榨四十多副，電力榨四十多副。</p>
<p>恒興泰油廠，有職工二百多名，榨八副，花生油很有名，現有職工百餘人，榨亦未全開。</p>
<p>長德油廠，最盛時職工三百多人，豆餅榨五十多副，棉子榨八副，現在開四副棉子榨，職工不足百人。</p>
<p>大德油廠，職工百餘名，有榨六七十副，專做豆餅。</p>
<p>供求現况</p>
<p>由於戰爭及普遍的經濟恐慌，榨油業迭受打擊，完全陷於破產，現在惟大有除，大昌新，大德新，大生等四家為自營，其餘或係軍管理，或由注行租用。此自營之四家因原料缺乏及電力限制，幾完全停頓。至於製油原料有黃豆，棉子，花生，菜子，工蔴五種，黃豆’花生，芝蔴來自東北，華北等地，現以運輪困難，到貨甚稀；菜子，棉子在滬杭路，京滬路沿綫各地及崇明蘇北各縣皆有出產，但因交通不便，到貨也很少。</p>
<p>上海每月食油需要量過去約四百萬斤，現在因市民購買力薄弱，每月只需二百餘萬斤。如此四百萬市民平均分配，每人每月消耗油半斤，自從電力限制以後，豆油燈每家都添置了一二　，這樣就又增加了八十多萬斤食油的消耗。</p>
<p>公會市塲</p>
<p>食油同業組織本有雜糧油餅業同業公會，民卅一年間，興來業合組公會，定名上海特別市來麥雜糧油餅業同業公會，三十二年審組繼為上海區食用油業同業公會，籍市區及市屬之申江，奉賢，南滬，川沙，嘉定，實山，祟明等七縣，後以嘉定情形特殊，乃真出。貧油市塲向設大上海路十五號樓上，去年因禁止期貨買賣，由油糧業同業公會暫命停止，至今尙未恢復，以致各油商多在馬路上做交易，並無固定市塲。至形成食油黑市之原因頗多：　運輸困難，使原料或製成品無法運來，現多為單帮另星帶來。　生產量減少，由於晨村的日益貧乏，捐稅繁重及收買價不够成本，故豆，花生，芝蔴等產量不盟。　工廠電力受限制，滬地無法大量生產。　鄰縣食油未限價，致使巳抵滬市近郊之食油，轉而流向鄰縣，於是造成無油應市之現象。</p>
<h3>市立學校　房捐豁免</h3>
<p>市府去歲五月間擬定學校繳納房捐雜稅辦法三項，其第一項規定：「市立或私立學校，經敎育局立案者，房地捐仍應照納，如要求補助，經呈請核准後，得以按照應納房捐數目補助之。」自該項辦法公布施行後，教育局迭據市校呈報接牽財政局通知，須照繳房捐。聞敎育局鑒於市校經費皆由市府撥發，若再呈府請款付捐，不獨手續頻繁，即對市庫稅收，實無補益。聞現已呈奉市府核准，將該辦法第一項前半段，修正為：「市立學校房捐一律豁免」，並分令財政局財務委員會知照。</p>
<h3>教員朦領配米　校長亦須處分</h3>
<p>近來有關當局查悉私立學校職員朦領配米案件數起，即經分別輕重，對該朦領教職員，予以處分，各情已詳載於三月二十八日本市各報，頃悉教育局接奉市府令，凡各校教職員工，嗣後再有朦領配米情事發生，不但該員本人應受處罰，即各該有關學校校長，亦一併予以外分。</p>
<p>簡訊</p>
<p>華北滙劃照常辦理　本市銀錢行莊，昨日起對於華北滙款，已一律照常辦理，滙水亦按原定數額，聯銀與儲幣比率仍為百元折合十八元，絕無變更，惟聯銀黑市價較高。</p>

<p>本市橡膠原料製品等業，以原料來源吿斷，電力調整未予恢復，業務已一蹶不振。據悉該業聯合會曾徇會員之請，分請當局解決原料及電力所需，惟至今尙未批覆，以致各該廠商似已陷於停頓狀態。至於若干廠商目前尙能製品買賣者。其原料均屬求之黑市，成本綦鉅，銷路方面，近亦減少，蓋過去囤貨紛吿出籠，售價低於當局公定價格，新生產橡膠物品，已無利益可圖。</p>

<h3>銅山閱軍記—淮海紀行之五—</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>月之七日晨，記者趕往省政府，應郝省長遠足之邀，抵門，郝氏早在等候。車經市區過慶雲治，沿途所遇之日僑見郝氏之車經過，皆脫帽致敬，雖孩童亦然，足見彼此平常情感融洽之一班。約五分鐘，車出北關，公路不甚平坦，沿途鄕民多牽小驢，荷麥來徐，成羣結隊。最引人注意者，為別具一格的牛車，此車備四大鐵輪，行時用牛三四頭拖行，據同行之銅山縣長薛激子氏語記者，僅鋼山一縣，有此種牛車三千輛。</p>
<p>約一刻鐘，經擊山而成之公路口，過平山口，沿途碉堡林立。據郝氏謂，淮海軍事向採穩紥穩打政策，目前已造成之　堡，有一一七○餘座。除有高大之砲樓及瞭望台外，堡之四週皆築有完整之工事，每一堡內，經常皆駐有一定數量之隊伍，備十日至十五日之糧，每隔十日至十五日，瓜代者到後即調他處，藉免日久生怠。</p>
<p>經小孤山，拾屯，固城，抵銅山縣之口口口地。車於軍樂聲中，曳然而止。下車後，郝氏即視察工事，指點一切。按口口口係淮海省重要據點，其面積約兩　，居民四百戶，人口四千五百人，壯丁約二千五百人，居民顚皆經商，莊內有中心小學一所，有學生兩百五十人、全為免費生。</p>
<p>十時正式檢閱，數千精神抖擻之健兒，鵠立塲中，郝氏登檢閱台後，由團長發號施令，開始檢閱。最饒興趣者，為面槍連與迫擊砲隊之演習，行動敏捷，景象遍眞。郝氏每下台親察其機槍與砲之保管，是否良好，並令當面拆卸武器，考騐其技術，且諱諄吿以機械隊之優良與否，關係全體隊伍弟兄安全之重要，務宜愼重保護珍惜云。</p>
<p>四小時後全體檢閱已畢，郝氏擇尤加以獎勉與擢升。旋於事後對全體訓話，示以平素治軍五要則，略謂：</p>
<p>愛護老百姓　當此戰時，正為軍人奮身報國之時，對老百姓應加意愛護，彼此互助，庶能成為衛國捍民之軍隊，有違犯者，決不寬恕，如最近駐蕭縣某隊特務長土某，因借民物持强不還，經民衆控吿，已予槍決，其長官亦以管束疏忽被拘。　不打敗仗　敵我武器優劣懸殊，敵我實力為士與一之比，月前蕭縣境內之戰鬥，除度火戰果外，並擊斃敵旅長一員，故今後汝等作戰，宜勇往直前凱旋，歸，余決不願見有沾軍譽之殘兵敗將。　不投降　吾人雖於困難境地中，應爭取最後勝利。萬不得已，亦須殺身成仁，以保軍人榮譽。如週前夏　之戰，班村據點被圍四日，雖經敵人威過利誘勸降，但不為所動，繩十兵張富英，設法冒險逃出，獲得援軍，表外合應，終能完成任務，突圍以出。　不繳槍　一頭可斷槍不可繳」，能此敵我大戰，我方以千人黎四萬人，然能支持至最後之五分鐘，將敵人悉數驅逐出境，今番勝利，堪增此後吾人作戰之信念。　不開小差　逃避為軍人之奇恥大辱、軍人宜以能吃苦耐勞為光榮。最後郝氏並闡述其倡導之「死的敎育」，即　不怕死：臨陣惶懼，最為愚蠢，按子彈速率，每分鐘四百米達，而人僅數十步，故逃亦無用。　我死敵亦死：萬不得已應抱敵我同歸於盡之決心。　敵死我不死：始為訓練精良軍人之人現，亦為戰鬥中之最上策。</p>
<p>訓辭於歡呼聲中請束。郝氏當召其幹部軍官於團部中共進簡單之午餐，席間郝氏以天時漸暖，再三以士兵之衛生為念。又向當地區長拾瀛洲氏，垂詢當地軍隊有否擾民之舉。定見郝氏對民模之關切。</p>
<p>飯後啓程返徐，車經口口鄕時，都氏停車導觀該地防禦工程，山類築有堡壘多座，駐軍日夜守望，實為軍事要地。參觀畢糨續前進，於小孤山間遇大隊騎兵，揚旗躍馬於柳林麥山間，風馳而逝。抵徐市，夕陽已斜，腦中猶浮現口口口團部牆上之「服從犧牲，團結互助」標語，與負有淮海治安重責之數千中華健兒之英姿。</p>

<h3>Japan Convenes Meeting of Ambassadors from Various Nations, Issues Joint Statement Yesterday Reaffirming Determination to Complete the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - It has been one and a half years since the Greater East Asia Conference was convened in November of the year before last. During this period, the enemy's, Britain and America's, ambition to dominate Greater East Asia has become increasingly exposed, threatening the independence of Greater East Asian nations and invading various parts of Greater East Asia. The Japanese government, in order to thoroughly establish the principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration and to adapt to the changing world situation in accordance with the ideals guiding Greater East Asia, with the understanding of the governments of various Greater East Asian nations, decided to convene a meeting of Greater East Asia Ambassadors. This meeting was held in Tokyo. Attendees included Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō, Republic of China Ambassador Cai, Manchukuo Ambassador Wang, Burma Ambassador Thein Maung, Thailand Ambassador U Chit, and Philippine Republic Ambassador Vargas. They frankly exchanged opinions on ways to complete the Greater East Asia War and on building a world order based on common war aims. In the final meeting on the 23rd, they passed the Greater East Asia Joint Statement, further expanding and developing the Greater East Asia Declaration. The enemy, Britain and America, plans to convene the San Francisco Conference on the 25th to discuss post-war international security guarantees. However, the world order advocated by Britain and America is an order of great power tyranny and monopoly. Even within the enemy's ranks, this point has been clearly pointed out. They themselves have overturned the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and their inconsistency is despised by the world. The Greater East Asia Declaration, which states the war aims of the Greater East Asian nations, is determined to eliminate such tyranny, monopoly, and discrimination, and to build a just new world order. It reaffirms the magnificent determination of our 1 billion Greater East Asian people to concentrate all their strength and crush the enemy's ambitions. Its significance is extremely important.</p>
<p>Ambassador Meeting Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Greater East Asia Ambassador Meeting convened at 9:00 AM on the 23rd in the Diet Building. Attendees included the Chinese Ambassador Cai and his staff, Japanese Foreign Minister Tōgō, Director-General of the East Asia Ministry Antō, Director-General of the Army Affairs Bureau of the Army Yoshizumi, Director-General of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Navy Tada, Third Director of the Information Bureau Iguchi, Manchukuo Ambassador Wang, Thailand Ambassador U Chit, Burma Ambassador Thein Maung, Philippine Ambassador Vargas and their staff, the representative of the Provisional Government of Free India, and Murti, the chief of the Japan branch of the Ba Maw Independence League, attended as observers. First, Foreign Minister Tōgō and the ambassadors of each country delivered general opinions. After a break at noon, the meeting resumed at 1:30 PM and continued with a closed session. The closed session ended at 2:30 PM, and a public meeting was held specifically for journalists and other qualified individuals. First, Foreign Minister Tōgō explained the reasons for submitting the joint statement and asked for the opinions of the ambassadors of each country. Chinese Ambassador Cai Pei gave a speech expressing his approval, and the result was unanimous approval. Next, Foreign Minister Tōgō proposed a free discussion of common interests of the Greater East Asian nations. Thailand Ambassador U Chit proposed assisting Vietnam in completing its independence. Philippine Ambassador Vargas proposed assisting India's independence. Manchukuo Ambassador Wang proposed establishing a permanent liaison organization for the Greater East Asia Conference, all of which were passed unanimously. Finally, Burma Ambassador Thein Maung proposed notifying the Provisional Government of Free India of the discussions and decisions of the meeting, which was also passed. The meeting then declared its intention to expand the moral ideals of the Greater East Asia Declaration, to establish the great ideal of defeating British and American ambitions and establishing a world order, and to unite the Greater East Asian peoples with four resolutions. The meeting adjourned at 4:02 PM. Afterwards, a commemorative dinner party was held at the Foreign Minister's residence starting at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Four Resolutions</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The contents of the four resolutions decided upon at the Greater East Asia Ambassador Meeting are as follows: In view of the purport of the joint declaration supporting the completion of independence for various countries in Vietnam, it is sincerely hoped that the countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, which declared independence in the past, will complete the formation of emerging nations in the form they desire as soon as possible, forming a powerful entity in Greater East Asia, and advancing together to realize common ideals. In view of the resolution to support the independence of East India and the purport of the Greater East Asia Declaration, it is sincerely hoped that the people of East India will achieve their long-cherished wish for independence quickly through their continuous efforts and the goodwill assistance of Japan. Regarding the resolution on the permanent liaison organization of the Greater East Asia Conference, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and Greater East Asia construction, it is necessary to maintain close contact and cooperation at all times and to convene Greater East Asia Conferences at any time. Therefore, regular or temporary Greater East Asia Ambassador Meetings will be held as a permanent liaison organization to promote the effective operation of the Greater East Asia Conference. Regarding notifying the Provisional Government of India of the content of the discussions and decisions or resolutions of this meeting, because the liberation of India is a matter of concern for all countries in Greater East Asia, the content of the discussions, the decisions adopted, and the various resolutions will be communicated to that government in order to promote its approval.</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Joint Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The joint statement passed at the Greater East Asia Ambassador Meeting held in Tokyo on the 23rd is as follows:</p>
<p>The countries of Greater East Asia, facing the endless invasions of Britain and America, are cooperating with each other to liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and America, and to achieve self-existence and self-prosperity. Overcoming all difficulties, they have been advancing on the path to the common completion of the war until today. However, Britain and America are using their power to oppress various neutral countries, using them as tools for their war. In the name of liberating other countries, they are actually arbitrarily expanding their sphere of influence, interfering in the internal affairs of various countries. Needless to say, they are threatening the existence of opposing nations and the foundations of the survival of nations, and even attempting to completely obliterate their inherent cultures. The post-war plans that Britain and America harbor today, no matter what political methods are used to embellish them, are based solely on force, forcibly supporting an order that suits their intentions. This kind of ambition is ultimately difficult to conceal. Britain and America are attempting to place international politics under their tyranny and presumptuously take on the role of global police, further planning to monopolize the world's economy in order to make their imperialistic control of the world more permanent. Therefore, other countries and nations cannot be guaranteed a just and equal position for survival and prosperity, especially for the nations of Greater East Asia, they still adhere to prejudices and discriminatory concepts. The war aims of us and them are absolutely incompatible. Britain and America are consistently attempting to maintain and strengthen this irrational international order, while the war aims of the Greater East Asian nations are to eliminate such tyranny, monopoly, and discrimination, and to build a true order based on justice. The countries of Greater East Asia previously issued a joint declaration, clarifying the meaning and purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Now, because the violence of Britain and America is about to completely trample on international justice and human welfare, it is impossible to stand idly by. Therefore, Greater East Asia and various countries, based on their common war aims, have repeatedly stated at home and abroad the guiding principles for building a true world order.</p>
<p>Seven Resolutions. At the same time, in response to the attempts to obstruct and destroy the ambitions of Britain and America, reiterate the determination to temporarily concentrate all efforts to complete the war. The fundamental basis for establishing the international order should be the principles of political equality, economic reciprocity, and respect for inherent culture, abolishing all discrimination based on race, etc., and seeking co-existence and co-prosperity with harmony and cooperation as the aim. Regardless of the size of the country, its political equality must be guaranteed, and it must be given an equal opportunity for upward development. As for the form of politics, it is up to each country to choose what it wants without interference from other countries. Liberate the nations in colonial status, allowing each to be in its proper place and opening up a path for contributing to the advancement of human civilization. Eliminate the monopoly of resources, commerce, and international transportation, seek mutual economic assistance and cooperation in order to correct the imbalance in the world economy, and enable an economy that adapts to the creativity and diligence of the people of each country to flourish universally. Mutually respect the cultural traditions of each country, and at the same time, promote international harmony and human development through cultural exchange. Under the principle of non-threatening and non-aggression, eliminate armaments that threaten other countries, remove obstacles to communication, and prevent the continuous use of military force and economic means to exert pressure or instigate others. Regarding security guarantee institutions, avoid the arbitrariness of great powers and the uniform method of the whole world, and establish a security guarantee system suitable for local conditions, establish an order that can be used in conjunction with various security institutions in the world, and adapt to the constantly evolving world situation. Open up a path for changing the international order into peaceful ways.</p>

<h3>Thai Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai Foreign Minister Srisena, recently gave a speech regarding the San Francisco Conference to be convened on the 25th, stating: Although it is impossible to predict the content of the San Francisco Conference, as far as Greater East Asia is concerned, since that area is located on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, even if there is some kind of discussion, it will not affect the Greater East Asian people. We already have the Greater East Asia Declaration, which is the path that the East Asian people should follow. The war situation has now reached a bright period. The allied nation Japan is defeating Britain and America with an indomitable spirit. Thailand expresses its deep respect and vows to advance bravely towards the path of defeating the enemy based on the common declaration.</p>

<h3>Speeches by the Japanese Foreign Minister and Ambassadors of Various Countries at the Meeting</h3>
<p>Speech by the Japanese Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - At the Greater East Asia Ambassador Meeting, Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō delivered the following speech: "The modern history of East Asia is the history of Britain and America's ambition to control East Asia and the resistance of various East Asian countries against this. Britain and America, with their advanced weaponry and their ruthless cruelty and cunning, gradually achieved their ambitions, and repeatedly imposed unequal treaties on East Asian countries, further implementing policies of economic exploitation, placing East Asian peoples in a miserable fate from which they could not extricate themselves. The spirit of Japan　Nation has always taken the establishment of friendly relations with all nations as the foundation of its diplomacy, ensuring the stability of East Asia and seeking world peace. Before Japan could realize the above ideals, it was obstructed by the British and American conspiracy to invade East Asia and dominate the world. In the past, Japan advocated the abolition of racial discrimination, but was rejected by them. Britain and America also implemented their customary tactics in various East Asian countries, which led to the unfortunate China Incident. Afterwards, Britain and America focused on inciting turmoil in East Asia, while at the same time imposing military and economic pressure on Japan. Therefore, in order to protect itself and liberate and revive East Asia, Japan rose up resolutely and challenged the enemy. In short, this Greater East Asia War is the most meaningful war showing the entire East Asian national identity, and it is also a war for Japan's national survival and self-defense. As far as East Asia is concerned, the success or failure of the liberation and revival of the 1 billion people of East Asia depends on this war. As far as the world is concerned, whether a just international order of world justice and co-prosperity of all nations can be established is also related to this war. This is what the Japanese people firmly believe. Today's war situation is extremely serious. Allied Philippines and part of Burma, as well as some Japanese-controlled islands, have also been occupied by enemy forces. The Japanese mainland is also the target of their extremely inhumane indiscriminate bombing. Japan's loyal and incomparable army and brave allied soldiers are standing up to destroy the enemy's invasion, causing great sacrifices to the enemy forces. Looking at the British and American camp, they assume that the war situation is already in their favor, and are frequently extending their means of political strategy to the whole world, trampling on the autonomy and independence of neutral countries in order to expand their sphere of influence, and implementing unlimited illegal acts without any scruples. As for their war methods, they disregard human morality and specialize in inhumane and cruel methods to carry out large-scale killings and destruction. They also disregard the morality on which the civilized world is based. British and American, lacking such a sense of justice, think that they will soon win the war and are busy discussing post-war management issues. Their so-called post-war plan is to establish British and American military bases all over the world, stationing their troops, and using their great military power to monopolize the international police. As for the economic aspect, they intend to monopolize important resources and international transportation, and use the name of international cooperation to monopolize British and American politics and economy, exploit colonies, suppress backward countries, and seek the permanent prosperity of Britain and America alone. As for the political aspect, Britain and America, who profess so-called democracy and advocate racial equality, actually intend to monopolize international politics. This is clearly seen in the international security guarantee institution they are promoting. The so-called security guarantee is that they intend to use British and American cooperation to protect their own prosperity. Their so-called maintaining equality means taking the exploitation of colonies and implementing differential treatment of races as their principles. As the enemy's ambitions become increasingly clear, we should gather our total strength, insist on our determination to complete the war, and clarify that it is necessary to establish world order principles based on the trust and righteousness of the countries of Greater East Asia. Therefore, consultations have been carried out with the governments of various countries up to this day."</p>
<p>Speech by Ambassador Cai</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Our country's Ambassador Cai Pei delivered the following speech: "Since the invading demonic hands of British and American imperialism reached out to East Asia, the earliest victim was the Republic of China. After the Opium War, the poison of economic aggression became even more rampant. Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen in writings such as "Nationalism," "Pan-Asianism," and "The Problem of China's Survival," explained their ambitions with great pain. If we do not seek liberation, we will be forever trapped in a colonial status. However, in the modern history of East Asia, the national wars of the East Asian countries resisting the oppression and trampling of British and American imperialism have become clearly evident in reality. And the current Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of the East Asian nations, advancing together with the allied nations. Therefore, we should continue the noble legacy of the late Chairman Wang, and we should devote our full strength to ensure the completion of this holy war. Until now, Britain and America, with their vast material resources, have sought to achieve their ambitions to conquer the world. However, the allied nation Japan, with its calm and bold spirit, has dealt them a heavy blow. Other countries are also continuing to implement various forms of cooperation from their own positions. Therefore, the late Chairman Wang once instructed us to uphold the spirit of "sharing joys and sorrows, sharing life and death" to achieve our goals. Since the Greater East Asia War, the nations that have been liberated include Burma and the Philippines. This proves that the Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate the nations of East Asia. The Greater East Asia War is a just war of the Greater East Asian nations against British and American aggression, and it can also be called a war of self-defense. Regarding China, based on the five principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we are implementing close cooperation, gathering the total strength of Greater East Asia, and completing the Greater East Asia War in order to truly liberate the nations of Greater East Asia, to seek true world peace, and to establish a link in the new world order."</p>
<p>Speech by the Thai Ambassador</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai Ambassador U Chit delivered the following speech: "I hope this meeting will re-establish the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. We advocate that regardless of human designation and religion, independence should be supported, and the colors of colonialism and subordinate relations should be completely eliminated, driven out of the East Asian world, so that the enemy understands that our warfare is in accordance with justice and morality and can surely achieve victory. Our warfare is definitely not for revenge, let alone aversion, but to preserve our independent rights and the human status, so we should fight to the end, and believe that victory will belong to us."</p>
<p>Speech by the Philippine Ambassador</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Philippine Republic Ambassador Vargas delivered the following speech: "We Filipinos have become a free people, but in this world where selfishness and forceful destruction are rampant, the Filipinos are standing at a crossroads in history. However, I believe that the Filipinos' hearts always harbor the belief in justice and friendship. I and Laurel are equally convinced that the Filipinos must return to their original East Asian identity. This task may take ten years or even a hundred years, but the principles revealed by the Greater East Asia Declaration will surely be realized, and our ideals will surely be realized in the new world order and the free East Asian world."</p>
<p>Speech by Ambassador Wang</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Ambassador Wang of Manchukuo delivered the following speech: "The East Asian world has always been the land of our Greater East Asian nation's ancestors. Historically, for more than 6,000 years, we have enjoyed a self-sufficient life under the goals of mutual goodwill and harmony. Therefore, the nation has prospered, and the people's livelihood has been stable. However, Britain and America crossed the oceans to trample on our 1 billion people. Japan, for the survival of the Greater East Asian nation, eradicated the primary culprit and first opened fire on Britain and America. Therefore, it is not only the core of today's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but also the pioneer among Greater East Asian nation-states. Now that the countries of Greater East Asia have reached a critical juncture, due to the attacks of the Japanese special attack corps, the enemy forces in the Okinawa area have suffered heavy damage, so there is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, my Emperor said that the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo is one of life and death and cannot be separated. Our country's officials and people have taken this imperial edict to heart, pouring total effort in both material and mental aspects to enhance productivity. Therefore, the military industry is becoming more prosperous, and agricultural products have also been abundant in recent years, completing the mission of the so-called Greater East Asia military base. Our country, recognizing this important mission, is willing to fight and strive together with all countries. The survival of the billion people in Greater East Asia depends on this war. The war aims of the Japanese Empire are to liberate the Greater East Asian nations. The countries of Greater East Asia, recognizing this, are reciprocally engaging with sincerity, advancing towards the path of completing the war."</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The New World Situation</h3>
<p>— Yang Guangzheng</p>
<p>— Revised Manuscript of a Speech at the New Association Shanghai Branch's Current Affairs Lecture. Three Standpoints Should Be Adopted When Observing the World Situation: First, an objective standpoint, that is, making judgments based on facts, without prejudice or emotion, in order to arrive at correct conclusions. Second, a progressive standpoint; regarding the evolution of the situation, infer using the dialectical method instead of the mechanical method. One must understand that the factors of situational changes are very complex and tortuous, and definitely not simple matters; however, where there is change, there is progress. Third, a Chinese standpoint. We are Chinese, so we should understand how various changes affect China and how to utilize these changes to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality. Second, in observing the current situation, there should be two basic understandings: First, war is a continuation of politics. Political changes are sufficient to affect changes in the war situation, and can even change the nature of the war. Second, the current war is a triangular struggle, that is, the struggle between the Axis countries, the capitalist countries, and the communist countries, and not simply a two-sided war. Therefore, the development of the war is particularly complex and full of changes.</p>
<p>Let us first talk about the European situation: In the middle of last month, the Soviet army had continued its offensive to reach Steder, 125 miles northeast of Berlin, and Kustrin, 60 miles to the east, Frankfurt, 76 miles to the southeast, and Lauben, 70 miles to the south, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of Berlin. At that time, the British and American forces on the Western Front were still fighting in the Rhine region, more than 450 miles from Berlin. In order to defend Berlin, the German army transferred a large force to the Eastern Front to resist the Soviet army, thus allowing the British and American forces to advance eastward. At this time, the Soviet army could have directly attacked Berlin, but unexpectedly shifted its offensive focus to the south, seizing Vienna, the capital of Austria, and advancing towards Czechoslovakia. Why is this? There are three major reasons: 1. The Soviet army attacking Berlin alone would inevitably suffer heavy casualties. In order to make the British and American forces share the sacrifice, the Soviet Union remained inactive. 2. The Soviet army attacking Berlin alone would arouse greater hatred among Germans towards the Soviet Union, which would be a political mistake. 3. Taking advantage of the fact that the British and American forces had not yet penetrated the heart of Germany, seizing other regions of Europe.</p>
<p>In recent months, the British and American forces on the Western Front have invaded Hamburg in the north, occupied Hanover and Magdeburg in the north-central region, and occupied Leipzig in the south. They could have directly attacked Berlin from the central route, but afterwards, the British and American forces suddenly captured Dresden in the southeast of Leipzig and broke into Czechoslovakia from Hof. When the British and American forces approached Berlin, the Soviet army launched a major offensive against Berlin, launching a battle for Berlin (according to a dispatch on the 22nd, the Soviet army had broken into Berlin, while the American forces were still 80 miles away from Berlin). This indicates that while the British and Americans and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany together, they were also competing for territory in Europe, that is, competing for future hegemony in Europe.</p>
<p>The competition for European territory between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union did not start today. Last autumn, when the Soviet army was approaching Warsaw, it suddenly shifted its offensive to the Balkans, encompassing Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. At the same time, the British army, which was fighting in France, also moved a portion of its troops to land in Albania and Greece. As a result, a direct conflict occurred between the Greek left-wing army and the British army. This is one example. Another example is that before the outbreak of the European war, Britain and France intended to promote a war between Germany and the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, Germany and the Soviet Union suddenly signed an agreement, prompting the war between the Axis powers and Britain and France. Subsequently, Germany's power expanded greatly, and the Soviet Union implemented anti-German defense, resulting in the German-Soviet war. From this, it can be seen that both Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union want to consume the strength of other countries in order to expand their own countries. Currently, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are temporarily united because they have the same goals against Germany. Assuming that Berlin falls, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will each want to establish a new German regime, which will cause infighting. Further assuming that the European war ends, and the common object and unifying factors between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union disappear, then their contradictions may tend to expand again.</p>
<p>The contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can also be seen in the San Francisco Conference, which will be convened soon. For example, the issues of Poland's participation and voting rights have already been reported in the newspapers, so I will not elaborate further. Since Roosevelt's death and Truman's succession as president, the Soviet Union suddenly changed Molotov as the chief representative attending the San Francisco Conference. This may have been due to the United States' request, but it was also to have Molotov go and observe the American tendencies under the new president and to urge the United States not to change Roosevelt's policies. From this, one can see the Soviet Union's concerns about the United States.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States have different national policies, different political systems, and different interests, so their fundamental contradictions always exist. If the contradictions expand, it will cause disputes.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the East Asian situation: From the landing of American troops on Leyte Island on October 20 last year to the fall of Manila at the end of February this year, the Philippine battle is still ongoing. On February 17, American troops landed on Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, and the battle ended on March 17. Then, on April 1, American troops crossed Taiwan and landed on Okinawa Island, the main island of the Ryukyu Islands, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. The results of the battle have been reported in the newspapers, and the battle situation is quite tense. However, if Britain and the United States want to win, they must invade the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland. However, in war, the attacking party will inevitably suffer great sacrifices, this is one; the Japanese army's defenses on the mainland and the mainland are far more active and stronger than the defenses on the surrounding small islands, this is two; in modern three-dimensional warfare, the damage suffered by implementing a landing operation is far greater than other offensive operations, this is three; from the snail-like advance of the British and American troops after landing in Italy and the slow progress after landing in northern France, people have doubts about the combat capabilities of the British and American armies, this is four; also, if the British and American troops want to attack the Japanese mainland in the future, they must first occupy other small islands in southern Japan; if they want to attack the Chinese mainland, they must occupy the Zhoushan Islands east of Hangzhou Bay or Jeju Island in southern Korea. But remember, it took four or five months for the American army to invade the Philippines and it hasn't ended yet, and Iwo Jima is a very small island, and it took more than a month to occupy; in the future, if they go deeper into the Japanese Inland Sea, then the Japanese counterattack will be even more stubborn. Therefore, the East Asian war situation will be protracted.</p>
<p>So, will the Soviet Union help Britain and the United States in East Asia? It is true that the Soviet Union has announced that it will not extend the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact in exchange for concessions from Britain and the United States at the San Francisco Conference. However, the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact still has one year of validity, and Japan, in order to maintain or even improve Japanese-Soviet relations, has appointed Togo, who is well-versed in the Soviet Union, as Foreign Minister. Therefore, Japanese-Soviet relations will not deteriorate in this year, and assuming that the European war ends, the factors that prompted the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will disappear, and the realist Stalin will certainly not be exploited by Britain and the United States on the East Asian issue. Moreover, if Britain and the United States can restore their hegemonic rights in East Asia, then from Western Europe through the Mediterranean coast and Southwest Asia to the Chinese mainland under the rule of Chongqing, and to the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, all will be under the control of Britain and the United States, forming a large encirclement of the Soviet Union, which is not what the Soviet Union wants to see.</p>
<p>Therefore, assuming that the European war ends, there are two possible attitudes of the Soviet Union: one is that because it has suffered heavy sacrifices in the European war, it urgently seeks rest and revival, then it will not interfere in the East Asian war, allowing Britain and the United States and Japan to consume each other. In this way, the East Asian war may be prolonged. However, the third world war between capitalist countries and communist countries will break out sooner or later. If the Soviet Union intends to take advantage of this war to destroy capitalist countries all over the world, then it may transform the Second World War and launch the Third World War immediately. At present, Japan's controlled economy, political mobilization of the whole people, and foreign anti-imperialist policies have already deviated from the character of capitalism; so if the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union are expanded, then a Japanese-Soviet alliance, or even a Eurasian alliance, to implement an anti-imperialist war is not impossible. At that time, the war has already changed its nature, and class struggles may break out within Britain and the United States, causing great chaos, which is also not impossible.</p>
<p>The above are just speculations and cannot be regarded as a conclusion; however, the world situation does not simply move forward in a straight line, but will go through many twists and turns before the results can be seen, which is a roughly accurate principle. In this world of twists and turns, what about China?</p>
<p>The goal of the Chinese revolution for a hundred years has been to seek independence internationally, democracy politically, and symbiosis economically; therefore, we must overthrow imperialism, eliminate feudal remnants, and curb capitalism. In recent years, Japan has determined a new policy towards China due to the tight war situation. If the situation becomes more serious in the future, Japan must gradually implement the new policy of equality and mutual benefit in order to win China's cooperation. Since the character of the Japanese state has changed, our nation's enemies will be the various imperialist countries of Britain and the United States; only by overthrowing all imperialism can we eliminate the feudal remnants and capitalist forces under the cover of imperialism, and only then can we complete the Chinese revolution! On this point, China and Japan have a real need for cooperation and mutual assistance. Furthermore, this world war has weakened the power of various imperialist countries due to consumption, so it is a good opportunity for China to complete the revolution. However, if we want to achieve the goal of the revolution, we must rely on our own strength. Therefore, the people of the whole country should unite, work hard, and struggle together to complete national independence, political democracy, and economic equality!</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Ships and Bombs Okinawa North and Central Airfields</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the evening of the 20th, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked groups of large enemy ships south of Kerama Island. Another air squadron bombed the northern and central airfields that night. On the night of the 21st, they again raided the airfields, dropping numerous bombs. Another squadron attacked enemy ships on the eastern peninsula. At dawn on the 22nd, they sank a large transport ship in the waters off Kadena. The Japanese air force's fierce fighting from the 21st to the 22nd was visible from the land. Each attack resulted in dozens of large explosions. On the 22nd, over 300 enemy aircraft attacked Okinawa Island. Japanese squadrons also launched attacks on enemy fleets east of the archipelago on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Okinawa Island Recent Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report – Regarding the recent battle situation on Okinawa Island, according to news from military observers in this city, the enemy American forces, four miles from Naha, announced a halt two weeks ago. However, since the 19th of this month, the enemy American forces have launched a general counter-offensive, and the battle situation is quite intense. The American 7th Division on the east coast has shown a slight advancing trend, while in the central area, the enemy American 9th and 16th Divisions are currently encountering fierce Japanese attacks, and the enemy is unable to cross the line. On the west coast, the enemy American 27th Division is near Makiminato, and the enemy's false reports that they have occupied a portion of it have not been confirmed to this day, which shows that their reports are inaccurate. According to a statement made by the enemy commander, the operations on the island require extremely large sacrifices and a great deal of bloodshed for every small step forward, which shows the slow progress of the enemy forces. Near Minatogawa in southern Okinawa Island, the enemy used naval gun fire, but the Japanese army bravely repelled them at sea. The operations in southern Okinawa Island have become increasingly fierce in recent days, and through the Japanese army's courageous annihilation, the enemy's attempt to advance has been shattered. The battle situation in the Motobu Peninsula area has recently become fierce. On the one hand, Japanese special attack forces have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy, and the losses of the enemy forces attacking in that area have gradually increased. In particular, the Japanese special attack forces are brave in killing the enemy, and the American army is extremely afraid. In enemy reports, they have tried their best to conceal their losses, and at the same time, they have made futile attempts to bomb Japan's mainland and the base of the special attack forces. At present, the spirit of the Japanese army and people is unified, and their will to fight is extremely high. Regarding the southeastern highlands of Ie Island, the Japanese army has bravely repelled the enemy.</p>
<h3>Thorough Overhaul of Manchukuo's Agricultural Administration Structure</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Manchukuo government, in view of the importance of agricultural administration in the current situation, has decided to overhaul and strengthen the structure of agricultural administration, which will be implemented from May 1.

Goebbels stated that Berlin citizens who raise white flags or use cowardly attitudes to cause unrest or anxiety in the resistance during this period will be subject to the most severe punishment for this crime. The German authorities will immediately arrest such traitors if they are discovered. All Berlin citizens have the responsibility to defend their residences. Any residence that raises a white flag will not have the right to request protection. Such cowards will surely be punished. The general citizens of Berlin must now obey the orders of the German authorities so as not to hinder the actions of the German army and the People's Stormtroopers. The wartime traffic rules stipulate that general pedestrians and children cannot go out on the streets. At the same time, employees of munitions factories and public institutions should each guard their duties and work until the last minute. It is hoped that factory supervisors will maintain the safety of the factory inside and outside. I and my colleagues will never leave Berlin, and my wife will stay in Berlin until the very end. The defensive projects carried out in the past few weeks have further strengthened Berlin. These defensive projects extend from the suburbs to the city center. Thousands of tank barriers, road barriers, and underground projects have been completed around Berlin. Berlin has become the most heavily fortified city.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Encourages the Digging of Air Defense Wells Can be Used During Air Raids and Peacetime</h3>
<p>The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent water supply from being cut off in the event of an air raid, which would have a huge impact on firefighting, as well as the citizen's drinking water, has decided to encourage the digging of air defense wells, instructing each branch bureau, district, and joint guarantee to dig these wells. Not only can it cope with emergencies, but also use well water in peacetime to save tap water. Recently, companies that dig these earthen wells have been established one after another, like bamboo shoots after rain, and have posted advertisements to solicit business. Among them, there are inevitably speculators who mix in. The Air Defense Section of the Police Bureau has separately summoned each well-digging company for talks. The methods, depth, and prices of well-digging have all been reviewed. They must be reasonably ideal. Some have been reviewed and deemed qualified, and each branch bureau and joint guarantee has been notified to entrust these companies to dig.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Flour to be Distributed Within Days Price Adjusted to 400 Yuan Per Jin</h3>
<p>Regarding the distribution of household flour in this city, the Shanghai District Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office has consulted with the Flour and Wheat Control Association and decided to issue a portion soon, which will continue to be distributed within days. The amount of household flour allocated for this period will still be one jin (second-class flour) per person, and the distribution price will be 400 yuan, an increase of 300% compared to the original distribution price. It is reported that the adjustment of the distribution price of household flour this time has been discussed several times by the Flour and Wheat Association and the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office, and the adjustment standard has been determined based on the reasonable principle of not increasing the burden on the common people. The association and office believe that household flour is a necessary food for the general public, and the distribution price should not increase with general commodity prices. Therefore, in the past few months, the price has not been adjusted hastily, and the original distribution price has been maintained. However, due to the repeated increase in the purchase price of wheat since last year and the beginning of this year, the cost of flour production has increased more and more. If the original distribution price is still used, the losses will be huge. Therefore, after repeated consideration, the distribution price has been revised from the lowest standard. After this adjustment of the distribution price, the distribution of household flour will continue to be maintained without interruption. As for the distribution of special flour for various industries, the office is also preparing to continue to handle it.</p>

<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>The sources of edible oil in Shanghai have traditionally been dominated by Datong soybean oil and Qingniao raw oil. Recently, due to difficulties in shipping routes, large quantities of oil have not arrived in Shanghai for a long time. There are currently two sources: one is that vendors purchase in small quantities from Nantong, Dongtai, Taixian, Bengbu, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places; the other is that oil is transported from Shandong by sailboats to Wusong and Liuhe, and then transferred to Shanghai. Although Bengbu has abundant oil production, the arrival of goods is scarce due to poor fire transport.</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai was also a center for oil extraction, with more than 20 oil extraction factories and a total of more than 5,000 workers. In terms of sales, soybean oil was sold nationwide, raw oil was sold to South China, coconut oil was sold to local soap factories, and cotton oil was sold to the United States. In terms of oil cakes, soybean cake was sold to Guangdong, Xiamen, Oil Head and other places, followed by the line from Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou; rapeseed cake, cotton cake, and coconut cake were mainly sold in Japan, followed by South American countries, which is completely opposite to the current situation.</p>
<p>Oil Extraction Industry</p>
<p>The situation of each oil extraction factory in Shanghai is described below:</p>
<p>Tongchang Oil Factory, located in Nanmatou, has a history of more than 40 years and is the oldest oil factory in Shanghai. It produces soybean cake and cottonseed cake. The factory has more than 100 employees, mostly from Tongzhou, followed by Shaoxing and Ningbo, and not many from Northern Jiangsu. It has been shut down for a long time.</p>
<p>Dayouyu Oil Factory, the largest oil factory in Shanghai, has a history of more than 30 years. When it is fully operational, it has more than 1,000 workers. Now it only has more than 100 workers. It can produce more than 800 catties of soybean oil per day, more than 800 pieces, more than 800 catties of cottonseed oil, and more than 400 dan of cake. Now, due to the lack of raw materials, production has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Dade Xinshan Factory was established not long ago, and its products are of excellent quality. It has four sets of cottonseed presses and nearly 100 workers. It can produce more than 800 catties of oil and more than 400 dan of cake per day.</p>
<p>Lide Oil Factory was founded more than 30 years ago, has more than 300 workers, and has 12 sets of cottonseed presses and 4 sets of coconut presses. Coconut oil is the most famous, and peanut oil is also good, but the soybean cake business is sluggish and has fallen into a state of shutdown.</p>
<p>Dachang Oil Factory had more than 300 workers at its peak, producing soybean cake, cottonseed cake, coconut cake, etc. It has more than 80 sets of soybean cake presses and 8 sets of peanut presses.</p>
<p>Defeng Oil Factory has more than 200 employees and only makes soybean cake. It can produce 6,000 pieces of soybean cake per day. It has more than 40 manual presses and 40 electric presses.</p>
<p>Hengxingtai Oil Factory has more than 200 employees and 8 presses. Peanut oil is very famous. There are now more than 100 employees, and the presses are not fully operational.</p>
<p>Changde Oil Factory had more than 300 employees at its peak, with more than 50 soybean cake presses and 8 cottonseed presses. It now operates four cottonseed presses and has fewer than 100 employees.</p>
<p>Dade Oil Factory has more than 100 employees and has 60 to 70 presses, specializing in soybean cake.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Due to the war and widespread economic panic, the oil extraction industry has been repeatedly hit and has completely fallen into bankruptcy. Now only Dayouyu, Dachang Xin, Dade Xin, Dasheng and other four companies are self-operated, and the rest are either managed by the military or leased by commercial banks. The four self-operated companies are almost completely shut down due to lack of raw materials and electricity restrictions. The raw materials for oil production include soybeans, cottonseed, peanuts, rapeseed, and hemp. Soybeans, peanuts, and sesame seeds come from Northeast China, North China, and other places. Now, due to transportation difficulties, the arrival of goods is very scarce. Rapeseed and cottonseed are produced along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, the Beijing-Shanghai Road, and in Chongming and Northern Jiangsu, but due to inconvenient transportation, the arrival of goods is also very limited.</p>
<p>In the past, the monthly demand for edible oil in Shanghai was about 4 million catties, but now, due to the weak purchasing power of citizens, it only needs more than 2 million catties per month. If 4 million citizens are evenly distributed, each person consumes half a catty of oil per month. Since electricity restrictions, every household has added one or two soybean oil lamps, which has increased the consumption of edible oil by more than 800,000 catties.</p>
<p>Guild Market</p>
<p>The edible oil industry originally had the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association. In 1931, Xinglai Industry jointly formed an association, named the Shanghai Special City Wheat Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association. In 1932, it was reorganized into the Shanghai District Edible Oil Industry Association, covering the urban area and the seven counties of Shenjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming under the jurisdiction of the city. Later, due to the special circumstances of Jiading, it was excluded. The vegetable oil market used to be located on the upper floors of No. 15 Dasha Hai Road. Last year, due to the prohibition of futures trading, the Oil and Grain Industry Association temporarily ordered it to be suspended, and it has not yet been restored. As a result, most oil merchants trade on the road and there is no fixed market. There are many reasons for the formation of the black market for edible oil: 1. Transportation difficulties make it impossible to transport raw materials or finished products. Now, most of them are brought by single workers. 2. Reduced production due to the increasing poverty of morning villages, heavy donations and taxes, and purchase prices that are not enough to cover costs, so the production of beans, peanuts, sesame seeds, etc. is not good. 3. Factory electricity is restricted, and Shanghai cannot produce in large quantities. 4. Edible oil in neighboring counties is not price-limited, which causes the edible oil that has arrived in the near suburbs of Shanghai to flow to neighboring counties, resulting in a situation where there is no oil on the market.</p>
<h3>Municipal Schools Exempted from House Tax</h3>
<p>In May of last year, the municipal government drafted three measures for schools to pay house tax and miscellaneous taxes, the first of which stipulated: "Municipal or private schools that are registered with the Bureau of Education shall still pay land and house tax. If they request subsidies, they may be subsidized according to the amount of house tax payable after submitting a request and obtaining approval." Since the promulgation and implementation of this measure, the Bureau of Education has repeatedly received reports from municipal schools and has been notified by the Bureau of Finance that they must pay house tax. It is heard that the Bureau of Education, in view of the fact that the funds for municipal schools are allocated by the municipal government, if they submit another request to the government for funds to pay the tax, it will not only be a frequent procedure, but also will not benefit the municipal treasury tax revenue. It is heard that the municipal government has now approved the revision of the first half of the first measure to: "Municipal schools are exempt from house tax across the board," and ordered the Bureau of Finance and the Finance Committee to be informed.</p>
<h3>Teachers Who Illegally Receive Rationed Rice - Principals Must Also Be Punished</h3>
<p>Recently, the relevant authorities have discovered several cases of employees of private schools illegally receiving rationed rice. After distinguishing the severity of each case, the relevant teachers and staff members were punished. The details have been reported in various newspapers in the city on March 28. It is learned that the Bureau of Education has received an order from the municipal government that if teachers and staff members of various schools illegally receive rationed rice again in the future, not only will the person concerned be punished, but the principals of the relevant schools will also be given an additional punishment.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>North China Remittances Handled as Usual: Money shops and banks in the city have been handling remittances to North China as usual since yesterday. The exchange rate is also based on the original amount. The ratio between the United Reserve Bank [聯銀] and the Reserve Currency [儲幣] is still 18 yuan for 100 yuan, with no change. However, the black market price of the United Reserve Bank is higher.</p>
<p>Salt Administration Tightens Anti-Smuggling:</p>
<p>The Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has established an investigation team this month, divided into three groups, to carry out anti-smuggling work in Pudong, Jiading, Luodian, Taicang, Fengxian, Shenjiang, Songjiang, and other places near Shanghai, and strictly limit the price of table salt. Those who violate the regulations will be dealt with severely.</p>
<p>Rubber Industry Lacks Raw Materials:</p>
<p>The rubber raw materials and products industry in the city has been in a slump due to the interruption of raw material supply and the failure to restore electricity adjustment. It is reported that the Rubber Industry Association has requested the authorities to solve the raw material and electricity needs at the request of its members, but no reply has been received so far, so that the manufacturers have been in a state of suspension. As for some manufacturers who can still produce and sell products, their raw materials are all sought on the black market, and the cost is high. In terms of sales, it has also decreased recently, because the goods that have been hoarded in the past have been released, and the selling price is lower than the official price set by the authorities. There is no profit to be made from the newly produced rubber products.</p>

<p>Reader's Scholarship News</p>
<h3>Free Treatment Guidelines for Students Aided by This Newspaper - Entrusted to Five Hospitals - Must Register with School Registration Certificate</h3>
<p>In order to improve the health of poor students, the office of the reader's scholarship of this newspaper has allocated 1 million yuan from the interest of the scholarship as "Medical Expenses for Assisted Students", and has selected five hospitals in the urban area with suitable locations and complete equipment, and entrusted them to handle the treatment of assisted students. It has been decided to start the implementation from today. The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>The 1 million yuan that this office will propose from the interest of the scholarship will be pre-allocated to the following five hospitals on average: No. 363 Huashan Road, First Hospital of the Red Cross; No. 361 Lane Datong Road, Hongren Hospital; No. 125 Taoyuan Road, Siming Hospital; No. 1 Nantong Road, Nanyang Hospital; No. 197 Huangshan Road, Guangci Hospital.</p>
<p>When students who have been assisted by this newspaper hold their student status and go to the above hospitals for treatment, they must check their residence permit (because the student card does not have a photo) to ensure that there are no errors, then all outpatient and necessary diagnosis fees will be paid by this office, that is, each hospital will credit it to the pre-allocated funds in this office, but the hospitalization fee and all medicine fees will be paid by the students themselves.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the treatment, this office will print free treatment monthly reports and send them to each hospital. The symptoms and treatment of the students will be filled in item by item, and sent to this office for review at the end of each month and published in the newspaper.</p>
<p>When the pre-allocated medical expenses are exhausted, we can discuss follow-up methods based on the situation.</p>
<p>The above measures will be implemented from April 20, 1945.</p>
<h3>Marine Art Exhibition Call for Paintings</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is becoming more intense, and the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia is becoming stronger. In particular, the close cooperation between China and Japan in military, political and economic aspects is really worth celebrating. The Shanghai Marine Art Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, sponsored by the Japan Fleet News Department, and supported by the International Cultural Promotion Association, will open on the 40th anniversary of the Japanese Imperial Navy, which is of profound significance. It will make people realize the importance of the ocean, resist the ethnic fighting spirit of the United Kingdom and the United States in defending the Greater East Asian waters, and integrate the spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation in the performance of art, so as to give it greater combat power and strive for final victory.

<p>Consumption Surcharge</p>
<p>Question about Payment by Third Tenants</p>
<p>This office received a letter from a third tenant reader asking about the water fee deposit issue. The original letter said: "The water fee of each household in our alley (No. 403 Changyang Road) has always been included in the rent by the landlord. Recently, the water company urged to increase the deposit, so the landlord informed the second tenants that each household must pay a deposit of 3,500 yuan, and the second tenants calculated it according to the registered population in this household and collected it from the third tenants, which has not been resolved for several days. It is found that this dispute is not limited to our alley, so it is worth discussing whether the deposit should be jointly borne by the third tenants, and whether it can be recovered when moving out in the future. I dare to raise it and want to discuss it with those who care about social undertakings." (According to this office, if the tenant and the landlord specify in the lease contract that the water fee is included, the landlord should be responsible in principle. It is an exception if the tenant agrees to share it with the landlord, but it cannot be forcibly shared. If it is shared, the landlord should refund it to the tenant when moving out, because the deposit receipt is held by the landlord. Recently, the water and electricity deposit has often been increased. In order to avoid causing disputes, it seems that the construction authorities should specify a method to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Military Review at Tongshan—Fifth Installment of Travels in the Huaihai Region —</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>On the morning of the seventh day of the month, the reporter hurried to the provincial government office, responding to Governor Hao's invitation to a field visit. Upon arriving at the gate, Mr. Hao was already waiting. The car passed through the urban area and Qingyun Township. The Japanese residents encountered along the way all took off their hats to salute Governor Hao's car as it passed, even the children, demonstrating the usual harmonious relationship between them. After about five minutes, the car exited the North Gate. The road was not very smooth. Along the way, many villagers led small donkeys, carrying wheat to Xuzhou, forming groups. Most notable were the unique ox carts. These carts had four large iron wheels and were pulled by three or four oxen. According to Mr. Xue Jizi, the magistrate of Tongshan County, who was traveling with the reporter, Tongshan County alone had three thousand of these ox carts.</p>
<p>After about fifteen minutes, we passed through a road cut through the mountain, and then passed Pingshankou, where blockhouses stood densely along the way. According to Mr. Hao, the Huaihai military has always adopted a steady and solid approach to military affairs. Currently, over 1,170 blockhouses have been built. In addition to tall gun towers and observation posts, the surroundings of each blockhouse are fortified with complete fortifications. A certain number of troops are stationed in each blockhouse, equipped with enough food for ten to fifteen days. Every ten to fifteen days, replacements arrive and the previous troops are transferred elsewhere to prevent them from becoming lax over time.</p>
<p>We passed Xiaogushan, Shitun, and Gucheng, arriving at a [illegible] area in Tongshan County. The car stopped to the sound of military music. After getting out of the car, Mr. Hao immediately inspected the fortifications, giving instructions. The [illegible] area is an important stronghold in Huaihai Province, with an area of about two [illegible], 400 households, a population of 4,500, and about 2,500 able-bodied men. The residents are all engaged in commerce. There is a central elementary school in the village with 250 students, all of whom are admitted free of charge.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, the formal review began. Thousands of energetic and spirited soldiers stood in the center of the field. After Mr. Hao ascended the reviewing stand, the regimental commander issued commands and the review began. The most interesting part was the drill of the bayonet squad and the mortar team, whose actions were swift and the scene was very realistic. Mr. Hao went down from the platform to personally inspect the maintenance of their machine guns and cannons to ensure they were in good condition. He also ordered the weapons to be disassembled on the spot to test their technical skills, and earnestly instructed them that the quality of the machinery team was crucial to the safety of all the troops, and that they must protect and cherish them carefully.</p>
<p>After four hours, the entire review was completed. Mr. Hao selected the best to reward and promote. Afterwards, he addressed the entire group, outlining his five key principles for governing the army, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Protect the common people: During this time of war, it is the time for soldiers to devote themselves to serving the country. They should take extra care to protect the common people and help each other, so that they can become an army that defends the country and protects the people. Any violation will not be tolerated. For example, recently, the head of the special service team of a certain unit stationed in Xiaoxian County, Mr. Tu, was executed for borrowing civilian goods and refusing to return them after relying on his power, after the public made accusations. His superiors were also detained for negligent supervision. Do not suffer defeats: The disparity in weaponry between us and the enemy is vast, and the strength of the enemy compared to us is ten to one. In the battle in Xiaoxian County last month, in addition to seizing war spoils, an enemy brigade commander was killed. Therefore, in future battles, you should bravely advance and return in triumph. I do not wish to see any defeated soldiers who disgrace the military's reputation. Do not surrender: Even in difficult situations, we should strive for final victory. If there is no other option, we must sacrifice ourselves to preserve the honor of the military. For example, in the battle of Xiajiayu the week before last, the Banzun stronghold was besieged for four days. Despite the enemy's threats and inducements to surrender, they were unmoved. Zhang Fuying, a squad leader, managed to escape at risk and obtain reinforcements. Their cooperation from the inside and outside ultimately enabled them to complete their mission and break through the encirclement. Do not surrender your weapons: “One’s head can be severed, but the weapon cannot be surrendered." In the previous great battle with the enemy, our side used one thousand men to defeat four thousand, and managed to hold out until the last five minutes, driving all the enemies out of the country. This victory can strengthen our faith in future battles. Do not desert: Desertion is a great shame and disgrace to a soldier. Soldiers should take pride in being able to endure hardship. Finally, Mr. Hao elaborated on his advocacy of "death education," which is: Fearlessness of death: Being afraid on the battlefield is the most foolish thing. According to the bullet velocity, it travels at 400 meters per minute, while a person can only run a few dozen steps, so fleeing is useless. I die, the enemy also dies: If there is no other option, one should have the determination to perish together with the enemy. The enemy dies, but I do not: This is the ideal that should be exhibited by a well-trained soldier, and it is also the best strategy in battle.</p>
<p>The address concluded in cheers. Mr. Hao then summoned his officers to the regimental headquarters for a simple lunch. During the meal, Mr. Hao repeatedly stressed the importance of soldiers' hygiene as the weather was getting warmer. He also inquired from District Chief Shi Yingzhou about whether the local troops had been disturbing the people. It was evident that Mr. Hao was concerned about the welfare of the people.</p>
<p>After the meal, we set off to return to Xuzhou. When the car passed [illegible] Township, Mr. Hao stopped the car to observe the local defense works. Multiple fortresses were built on the mountains, guarded day and night by troops. It was truly an important military location. After the inspection, we continued on, encountering a large cavalry unit between Xiaogushan. They were waving flags and galloping their horses between the willow trees and wheat fields, speeding past like the wind. When we arrived in Xuzhou City, the sun was already setting. The slogan "Obedience, Sacrifice, Unity, Mutual Assistance" on the wall of the [illegible] regimental headquarters, and the heroic figures of the thousands of Chinese soldiers responsible for maintaining security in the Huaihai region, still floated in my mind.</p>
