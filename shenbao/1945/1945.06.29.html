<p>琉球羣島基地二十八日中央社電　日軍航空部隊二十七日復會數度攻擊冲繩週圍之敵艦船，而於二十五。六兩日間之攻　戰果，業經查明擊毀敵艦種不詳者一艘。</p>

<p>蘇黎世二十八日中央社電　瑞十蘇黎世日報，二十四日所揭戰之社論，以「大東亞戰爭」爲題，論述聯合國今後對日作戰之困難如次：日軍特攻隊，曾以果敢犧牲精神，施行肉體水雷突擊敵艦船，此種精神，乃日本一貫傳統之精神，於戰意上之表現，聯合國想已深知其對此精神旺盛之日軍展開攻勢如何困難。吾人試一變目光，而注視中國大陸，即可知悉聯合國雖以又已復開緬甸公路之交通，使補給中國方面聯合軍軍需，然中國之武器及資材，現尚極不充足，且聯合軍欲期登睦于中國大陸，勢必須先排除日航空部隊，潛水艇隊之成脅，故欲期壓制日本，則務須展開中國大陸作戰。今即假定聯合軍於登陸作戰上獲得成功，然因作戰地域極爲廣泛，故恐其主力雖與日軍芷面接觸，許是，則戰爭富更行轉成長期戰。而聯合軍爲避免轉成長期戰，亦必竭盡全力，作孤注一擲，對日本土展開登陸作戰，以期早日制服日本，然對日本土展開登陸作戰，又必將逍受日軍猛烈反擊，此實較展開中國登陸作戰更爲困難</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>畫吉田先生「涼台閑話」後</h3>
<p>吉田東　祐先生從日本歸來，第一篇與我們相見的「凉台閑話」一文，很正確地答覆了目前我們需要瞭解的問題。我們除了在大體上同意他對於當前中國問題的觀察之外，覺得尚有稍加補充之處，爰申述如次：</p>
<p>他對於當前中國幾個大問題，即：　美軍是否要在中國登陸？　蘇聯是否將參加太平洋戰爭？　蘇聯對渝共的態度問題，　日渝可能妥協麼？　日美可能妥協麼？　中共目光中的重慶，　重慶政府改組的意義，　蔣介石的立塲。這幾個問題，我們中國人米嘗不有相當認識，盟邦有關方面或者也有其特具的見解，經過吉田先生筆下的解釋以後，似乎得到更進一步的瞭解與認識。這是我們細讀他的文章以後第一個印象。如果要研究中國常前問題，或進一步解決中國當前的問題，如統一救國弱以及最近南京上海若干刋物上出現的政論，我們認爲像吉田先生在這篇文章中處理問題的能一度和多方面深刻的了解，應該是必須具備的條件。</p>
<p>他所解答的問題，歸納起來有二個：第一是國際列强對華及對東亞關係，第二是渝共關係。</p>
<p>就國際關係說，關於敵美今後的動　他明白提出三點，　「美國在日本和在中國，如果雙管齊下，同時展開大規模作戰，這是兵力及運輸力都不能允許的事。」　「英美和蘇聯的矛盾無論怎樣大，但其爆發，却待結東反日戰爭之後。」　「太平洋戰爭業已達到最後決戰階段的今日，日本與英美決不會締結妥協。」這種結論，大體上都是正確的。特別是　　兩點，可以矯正某些人的幻想，誤認英美隊聯會衝突誤會。日美可能妥協，囚而忘却了自已爲東亞人之東亞而參戰的嚴肅立塲，這是很合時宜的鐵砭。不過第一點，美國是否決不會在中國大陸登陸作戰。似乎尚　斷言。我們對於敵方的一切活動，決不可稍涉疏忽！至於吉田先生解　蘇聯對太平洋戰爭，對中共及種慶的態度，都很確　，無待我們蓋詞。</p>
<p>就渝共關係　，吉田先生很客觀地分析了　共的階級的經濟的及國際關係上的特徵，指出蘇聯雖然不會把中國造成西班牙第而，而且力避這一前送。但是共产黨必然堅特反渝鬥爭，而重慶爲着統一中國以在蘇美之間實現獨立的强大勢力，則不容中共成爲國內的另一國家，這是必然的趨勢。我們在這裏，對於渝共問的鬥爭，除了爲國家民族而產心　首之外，唯有加緊推　和平區的革新政治及改善民生運動，以期促進眞正的獨立。</p>
<p>就目前大局而論，我們不容許英美在中國大陸　動，我們也不容許渝其爲私爭而塗毒我民衆，唯一的出路，惟有集結全國人民的公意，造成一種力量，內求統一救國，外與盟邦協力。我們相　，只有中國問題徹底解決，東亞戰爭始能完遂；反轉來說，中國問題之解決，也和東亞戰爭勝利不可劃分的。所以，我們期望中日雙方朝野更緊密的協力，克服困難，邁步前進！</p>
<h3>日本特攻戰法　收獲重大效果　軍事評論家分析冲繩戰局</h3>
<p>滬市軍事評論家頃就冲繩島作戰前後，加以檢討，略謂，冲繩島陸上戰鬥巳告一段落，但日本航空隊及特攻隊依舊對冲繩周開敵艦艇羣繼續猛攻，故海上戰門仍在進行中。陸上戰現一如日大本營所發表者，業已結東。經過八十日之戰鬥，日軍以寡敵衆，勇戰善謀，竭力奮戰，而結果此島爲敵人所攻略，誠屬不幸。冲繩作戰由日方戰略方面視之，已獲得相當成果，該島過去戰况對今後之作戰上，亦予我人以若干教訓，可資借鏡，試分述之如次：</p>
<p>冲繩作戰所獲教訓</p>
<p>敵人之作戰位科學性的，第一特徽爲其補給艦隊之力量，作戰上補給距離與戰力成反比例，美軍攻冲繩距離甚長，戰略上當發生問題，但美軍爲克服此困難，派出有第十第六兩補給艦隊，不斷運　。</p>
<p>第二現象爲修理能力之强化，美軍在太平洋岸築有修理艦艇之大塢所，另用浮動船塢，爲防派遣至第一綫最近處，從事修理破船，工程迅速。美軍遭擊沉破艦船六百艘以上，照例應有八成遭損傷，但結果仍能完成其作戰任務者，不能不歸功於補充力量之强大也。</p>
<p>第三偽工兵及建設部隊之高度機械化，美軍不問登陸處地械大小如何，登陸後其工兵即迅速構築陣地，使航空隊及砲兵得以運用，故於作戰上得獲一切便利及制空權。此外，其大量高性能機械化部隊之進駐陣地亦爲特徵之一。其水陸兩用戰車登陸後，即大量利用之。第一綫上並配備有火焰放射器之戰　及「火箭」式大砲，比種利用化學與物量爲美人最誇耀之一點，我人雖不能作過小評價；惟如何利用，仍賴人力，故其力量之發揮，亦有一定之限度，猶若補給艦隊，其能力亦有限度是也。</p>
<p>本土作戰敵遭困難敵</p>
<p>對冲繩所用之兵力，陸上計七個師團，約十萬餘人，海上艦船一千四百艘，人員約四十二萬，動用船舶總數在二三千艘以上。史帝成爾會云：如對日本本土作戰，至少須五十萬兵力。可見其所需補給艦船將超出一萬艘以上。美軍事評論家謝力　云：美對日本本土登陸作戰，即動用最大至補給艦隊，亦屬不數。可知對日本本土作戰，其困難實殊重重。且中國大陸上日本又有龐大兵力，故對中國大陸之接岸作戰，尤爲不易。作戰時修理能力需要無限，非人力所可比擬，日本之殲滅戰法，異日必更擴大，故敵人之修理能力，勢必成一大問題。又上述第三第四點之機械化部隊，我人雖不能輕視，但亦不可對之作過大評價。</p>
<p>特攻戰法敵難理解　　關於日本血和生命鬥爭之教訓，我人可得而言者，即特攻隊之攻擊，在戰略上已獲得極大效果。特攻之精　爲必死必中之攻擊，以一架飛機破壞敵人一艦，此種方法使英美艦船消減六百艘以上，人員損失三十萬之上。敵從軍記者謂特攻戰法，爲敵人不能理解之戰法，同時並指摘美軍作戰指揮部之無能。敵軍事評論家稱：在此特攻戰法下。其海上之損失已超過陸上之損失，故日特攻戰法已令敵受極大威脅。日以一機破敵一艦一人殺百人，以日本　富之人力，此種戰法如縱續不斷，可使敵之物量及科學，遭受重大損失，不能發揮其效用。</p>
<p>勝利誰屬事實證明</p>
<p>其次爲日陣地之强靸性，日軍在山岳地帶所造成之洞穴陣地，抵禦敵之機械化部隊，極著成效，此項陣地在牧港及嘉敷二地，均會予敵以重大打擊。此一帶地方與敵作戰，經數週之久，雙方常在膠着狀熊中，結果敵不得不由北方移動重砲作戰，往往其整個師團被消減。又曾由北方移動兩個師團海兵補充損失，及至作戰後半期中，冲繩制海制空種不幸爲敵所把握，無法補充，故結果冲繩爲敵所攻陷。如敵人攻日本本土，則陸上旣有山　，又有無窮補充力量，必使敵寸步難進，以冲繩爲前哨戰之大決戰，不久即將到來，英美持其物量與科學，日本則以特殊之素質及地理優勢與之抵抗，英美之量與質有一定限度，日方則否，兩者間之鬥爭，勝利誰屬，將來可以事實蹬明，而觀上述數點，則日本必獲勝利無疑。</p>

<p>昭南二十八日中央社電　印度自由臨時政府，近因緬甸戰局激烈變化，乃被迫商後方移動，英國對印態度，亦於因歐戰終了，而積極以優良條件拉攏印度，因之臨時政府之獨立運動前途，乃遭遇一大難關，而英國最近提示對印新政策之「華維爾提案」，實質上與三年前之僅予自治形式，而不予實際獨立之克里浦斯提案出於一途，此均爲虛僞政策，然印度國內一部要人，尚根據客觀情勢，欲期接受此次新提案，故當前成爲問題者，已不僅臨時政府問題一項，即一切影響印度國內國外獨立鬬爭，以及將來之重要問題，亦必遭遇重大變化。臨時政府現正集結軍官民總力，突破時局難關，以求祖國之解放，而其最高領袖鮑斯，自本月十九日起，連夜以無綫電親自以北印度語，孟加拉語及英語廣播，痛烈抨擊英國對印政策，大聲疾呼，以提醒印度國內同志，活躍展開政治攻勢，其對印度廣播要旨，大約如次：　吾人須視華維爾提案之動機，其目的蓋欲欺騙印人，利用印人血汗，以完遂英國侵略東亞戰爭。　吾人須注視其提案之欺騙性，提案中關於「將來之獨立」一項文字，亦未得見結果承認提案，會議派所獲得者，僅為行政參議會之會員席數而已。且參議會員之任命權及決定事項之拒絕權，尚爲印度總督把持，新提案中所謂使印人担任內政，而司令官則仍以英人任之，且以戰時英軍之要求，利用印人，名目繁多，英國爲完遂對日戰爭，乃不得不囊括印人之資源。然欲期榨取已蒙極大犧牲之印度，必須對國民會議派拉攏，使之全體能對英協力，華維爾緹案最大重點即在於此。　新提案曾謂，對行政參議會印度兩黨採取同等之義，保持一定數之席位，其他之席位則得由總督意志隨意指揮，故總督得隨意拉攏任何黨派。　若承認此次提案，亦即實力派之會議派自己放棄印度本身獨立運動代表之光榮，降至一小黨派地位。　余對贊成承認提案之同胞，敢發一質問，「吾人完全獨立之目標，究將何適，一九四二年之要求，英國即刻撤退」之決定，將成何毬結果。　吾人須警界悲觀主義及敗戰主義者，吾人須熟思我等同胞血汗之汗犧牲價值，自由印度國民軍「至最後之一人及最取後之瞬息」，必須堅持戰至最後。　余望全國國民，不問總戰局之結果如何，務須加緊爲全印度之獨立而奮鬬。</p>
<h3>蘇聯向土耳其　提兩項要求　傅三頭會議將加討論</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二十八日中央社電　二十七日瑞士報載，據安卡拉電稱，蘇聯政府當廢棄于穌。土條約後，締新絛約之際，曾提出以下二條件，　蘇聯監視韃靼尼爾海峽，　改　蘇。土國境，蘇政府業將此二案，以備忘錄之形式，通達於土駐莫斯科大使及土耳其外交部。接韃靼尼爾海峽監視問題，因與英。美之關係至大，故土耳其須與美。英兩國政府商討後始能回答，如此恐爲土耳其所不能接納之條件也。又蘇聯政府前曾要求，土耳其東部之卡斯。阿古里斯兩地方轉讓與蘇聯，此亦將爲土耳其不能接納之條件，是故以隊聯之此項要求爲契機，蘇。土關係將趨惡化。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電據路透社特派訪員基許著稱，關於修正蒙德婁會議中曾規定管理韃靼尼爾海峽走應問題一項，已由蘇聯向土耳其提出商議要求，然此項問題亦將有在三頭會議中詳加討論之可能。蓋此問題之中，同時包括其他朮要複雜之情事多項，英政府旣爲該項海峽規定之簽署國，而現在却未曾接獲蘇聯向土耳其要求重加商議之任何通知，致使局外人不無猜疑。然據倫敦外交界之猜度，蘇聯此次向土耳其之提議，實與　日蘇聯向羅馬尼亞訂立關於多腦河口岸之協定時情形無異，故蘇聯此項建議，欲廢除目前蘇。土共同管理此海峽之協定，常爲明顯，且欲將蘇軍駐於與蘇聯利害有關之地區。然現在一般人深信，在未來柏林之三頭會議中，不但對韃靼尼爾海峽問題有所討論，對多特根尼斯及愛琴海島等之管理問題，亦將緹出商討。</p>
<h3>史太林晋陞　蘇聯大元帥</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據此間接獲莫斯科消息，蘇聯議長史太林’受命於最高一蘇維埃主席團，晋陸爲蘇聯大元帥。此項新　衛，乃依週二夜蘇聯最高蘇維埃主席團之命令而產生，主席團同時以英雄榮銜及列寧勛章授與史太林。</p>

<p>本年度戶口粉將按月維持粉統會負責人談話</p>
<p>在食糧問題嚴重之今日，雖經政府當局頒布米糧緊急指置，情勢略見級和，但目下距新　登塲，尚須三四月之久，在此所謂青黃不接米糧根本缺乏之期，今後民食，惟有求供於　粉及雜糧，以資補充，記者為此曾走訪粉麥統制會副主任委員井上氏，適値公出，乃由秘書長汪嘯水君接見。記者提出各問題，承答復如下：（問）聞今年小麥收成甚好，未知貴會已開始收購否？</p>
<p>（答）今年小麥收成確甚豐稔，惟本年底收買計劃，尚待呈行政院核准，始可付諸實施，預計可收三十五萬噸左右。</p>
<p>（問）上年度　粉成績當甚滿意？</p>
<p>（答）上年度收麥製粉情形，因麥價受其他物價之刺激，不斷上漲，加以運輸困難及電力限制等等，　粉生產量，終未能如所預期，故吾人幷不諱言，對於上年度成績，幷不認為滿意。</p>
<p>（問）現在米糧已屆青黃不接之期，民衆情厚望　粉及雜糧之補充，貴會對於戶口粉能予增加否？</p>
<p>（答）本會對於民食，曆來均竭盡棉力，本年度戶口粉仍按月維持，至少有一次配給，從未問斷，以後當仍繼續維持，免致中斷。至云增加配給粉量一層，仍當極力設法，期慰衆　。</p>
<p>（問）關於重點配給米糧，現已無望，未知　粉亦能略予點續否？</p>
<p>（答）本會　粉之存底旣如上所述，故重點配給，在維持戶口配給之時，似非力所能及，惟為顧及本市有關治安之軍營及行政人同生活起見，經關係方面之商治，曾致最大之協力，計已　給一萬餘　，實屬竭盡所能矣。</p>
<h3>銀錢業票據收付　數額倍增</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業，於此現鈔缺乏情况下，票據收付數額日見增加，每日張數之多，亦創空前紀錄，銀行業平均每日均有十萬張左右，錢業平均每日約有五萬張之譜。據悉各行莊票據收付，雖經指定行莊分擔其事務，然試辦收票，尚屬初步，銀行聯會錢準庫之　總轉工作，異電繁忙，加之又時間限制關係，各該　會會計部份每有應接不暇之困難。今後現鈔倘仍無充分供給，由撥款單停用而改用本票，則銀行錢業票據收付數字，將仍較多，即其交換收付帳之　額，亦朱必能滅少。</p>

<h3>李香蘭談歌唱藝術</h3>
<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>李香蘭小姐在大光明舉行獨唱會，公開獻歌三天，演出了「万人空巷」的盛况。這是一個國際知名的藝人：她在歌唱上的造詣和成功，以及她對歌唱的經騐和心得，一定為愛好歌唱的人所樂聞所重視的吧！</p>
<p>李小姐，是一個勤奮好學虛心求進的藝人，無論是生熟朋友，深淺之交，對她的印象總是抱這同一觀念的。雖然還只這麽年輕，可是就已有了不平凡的成就，她的歌聲似遍了各國和各地，甚至於大家對她所屬的國籍都發生了濃趣，朝鮮人說她是朝鮮人；台灣·滿洲人說她是台灣人·滿洲人；日本·蘇聯人說她是日本·蘇聯人；中國人呢，又說她是中國人。提到了這一問題，她說：「我眞是滿懷地感謝大家愛護的熱心寬體胖，說起來。我公司在滿洲，父母在北京，學歌在東京，而拍戲又在上海。我浪跡四方，說句不嫌俏皮的話，我應該說是屬於亞細亞洲的人！」這是多麽風趣的答覆。</p>
<p>說到她正式學歌唱，開始於十七歲那一年，其間是間　間學，而且有一個時間全化在拍戲上面。直到最近數年，因為興趣關係，又特別熱中歌唱起來，前後曾跟許多國籍不同的樂師學過，而且差不多是隨時隨地不斷地在學習，在求著進步。她學心的態度是嚴肅，認眞，熱愛而女謙虛永不自滿的。天賦是一個甜潤寬亮的歌　，她能唱到琴鍵上三部女高音的最高部的音階，這雖是得大獨厚，可也是由辛勤學習訓練得來的，她又長於强記，能唱各國方言的不同的中·日·蘇·德·法·意……的歌詞，用她多方面的天才和智慧，培養出一種獨特的能力來。她說：她要學一樣，像一樣，力求絕對的　確純　。會唱的歌固不在多，但務必做到「學啥像啥　，」完全和本國人唱本國歌一樣才行。这眞是一种堅靱不苟的學习精神！</p>
<p>她又提供了關於學唱的方法和必備的條件，這也是很値得吾人借鏡的。她說：普通人一般的唱法，多半是發自喉間音，而學唱有了相當的基礎和程度的，便懂得怎樣提取丹田之氣了。衷氣充沛飽滿，歌聲自能深遠圓潤，尾音也能餘韻不盡了。對於歌時的咬字·運聲·而且得滲入眞實的情感，音色才美麗，歌聲也才能悅耳動聽。不過，體力健，精神好，　量充足，這也是優秀歌者不可或缺的條件。</p>
<p>至於學唱的經騐，她也供獻了一點很寶貴的心得，她說：一般人學吧，動　總是愛說敎師敎得好或敎得不好地歸功罪於敎師，其實敎者總有一得之長的，問題全在學者自己能否切實領受，能否全部吸收，或者應該說是——是否懂得去「攫取」內中的精華，把來消化成自己的所有物。而且還要能體會揣摹歌意；貫入情感靈魂，然後歌聲才能操縱自如，出神入化。這也是一種忠於學術，認眞學習的態度呢！</p>
<p>問及她演唱時的心情，也的答語是：我站在台上，心中充滿了要流淚的感謝情緒，我覺得似使唱得不好，就對不起大家，就不配接受大家這份熱烈的厚愛。她又補充着說：我只願意做一個屬於大衆性（不是富貴的專利品）。的藝術家—是批歌唱方面的成就。這，又是為歌運的前途指出了一個多麽準確的途徑啊！</p>
<p>最近，她將舉行一次蘇聯歐劇的獻演，同時在趕拍一部以歌劇為中心的「夜來香」影片。聽說，她也答應了為本報籌募助學金來一次義唱！</p>
<p>最後談到了中國歌運的前途，她表未著：中國的歌壇，目前雖然還比較的幼稚，像是一種新興的藝術，最近幾年才被普遍地注重和愛好起來，但是，她是有進步並且充滿了希望的。</p>
<p>總之，李香　小姐是一個有著清醒的人生觀，有著堅定的事業觀，忠於藝術，力求進步的藝人。—我們謹為她無量的前途賀！同時也為後來繼起的藝人勉。</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Island: Japanese Air Force Achieves Success Attacking; US Aircraft Carrier Hit, Over Six Hundred Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 28th (Central News Agency) – On the 27th, Japanese air force units again launched several attacks on enemy warships around Okinawa. The results of attacks on the 25th and 26th have been confirmed, destroying one enemy warship of an unknown type.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – The US Navy Department announced on the 27th that the US aircraft carrier USS Cabot was attacked by Japanese special forces on Okinawa Island on May 2nd, taking a hit and catching fire. The crew suffered 373 deaths, 264 injuries, and 19 missing.</p>
<p>Zurich, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Swiss newspaper "Zurich Daily News" published an editorial on the 24th titled "The Greater East Asia War," discussing the difficulties the United Nations will face in future operations against Japan, as follows: The Japanese special attack units, with their courageous spirit of sacrifice, launched suicide torpedo attacks on enemy warships. This spirit is a consistent tradition of Japan, a manifestation of their war will. The United Nations is deeply aware of the difficulty in launching an offensive against such a vigorously spirited Japanese army. If we shift our gaze to the Chinese mainland, we can see that although the United Nations has reopened the Burma Road, supplying the Allied forces in China, China's weapons and materials are still extremely insufficient. Furthermore, if the Allied forces wish to land on the Chinese mainland, they must first eliminate the threats posed by the Japanese air force and submarine fleet. Therefore, to suppress Japan, it is necessary to launch operations on the Chinese mainland. Even if we assume that the Allied forces are successful in landing operations, the vastness of the operational area may mean that even if their main force comes into contact with the Japanese army, the war will turn into a protracted one. To avoid a protracted war, the Allied forces will also do everything possible to make a desperate gamble and launch landing operations on the Japanese mainland, hoping to subdue Japan as soon as possible. However, launching landing operations on the Japanese mainland will inevitably be met with fierce resistance from the Japanese army, making it even more difficult than launching landing operations in China.</p>

<h3>Rain Throughout Burma; Only Vanguard Contact; Japanese Commando Teams Prevent British Army from Advancing East</h3>
<p>Dianqian, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army stationed in Burma has completed the reorganization of its battle lines and the replacement of troops. They are resisting the British-Indian army launching an eastward advance in Xidan, and are currently engaged in fierce battles. At the same time, on the Southern Shan State Plateau, the Kalatongdong Triangle area, and the Begu Mountains, they are using strong fortifications to prevent the enemy's attempts to invade. Due to the rain and mud throughout the Burmese front, the mobility of both sides is greatly hindered, so there are no large-scale engagements on any front, only contact between small vanguard units. In the southern Shan State Plateau, which is covered by jungle, the enemy is gradually advancing east. Japanese elite troops are using commando teams to constantly attack the enemy's superior forces every day. These commando teams, with their whirlwind-like momentum, launch rapid and surprise attacks on enemy positions, preventing the enemy's attempts to advance. Furthermore, in the valley area southeast and northeast of the Zailawadi Delta, there are also Japanese fortifications, which have caused heavy casualties to the enemy for days. The enemy has acknowledged these sacrifices in their announcements. According to information from New Delhi, the Irrawaddy front is difficult to attack due to the tide-like firepower of the Japanese army. On the Southern Shan State Plateau, the Japanese army has deployed artillery positions everywhere, and it is reported that they have stopped the British army in the mountains of Donggomaqi. A special correspondent for the Indian United Press broadcast: The Japanese army now seems to be deploying strong fortifications on the east bank of the Xidan River, reorganizing its troops, and its equipment is mainly composed of excellent and powerful artillery.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Reading Mr. Yoshida's "Leisurely Talk on the Veranda"</h3>
<p>Mr. Yoshida Dongyou returned from Japan and his first article to meet us "Leisurely Talk on the Veranda" very accurately answered the questions we need to understand now. In addition to agreeing with his observations on the current problems in China in general, we feel that there are still some points to add, and we state them as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the current major problems in China, namely: Will the US military land in China? Will the Soviet Union participate in the Pacific War? The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Chongqing Communists, Is a compromise possible between Japan and Chongqing? Is a compromise possible between Japan and the United States? Chongqing in the eyes of the Chinese Communist Party, The significance of the reorganization of the Chongqing government, Jiang Jieshi's position. We Chinese people have quite a good understanding of these problems, and the relevant parties in the Allied countries may also have their own unique insights. After Mr. Yoshida's interpretation, it seems that we have gained a further understanding and understanding. This is our first impression after carefully reading his article. If we want to study the current problems in China or further solve the current problems in China, such as unified national salvation and the political discussions that have recently appeared in some publications in Nanjing and Shanghai, we believe that the ability to understand the problem from multiple perspectives and deeply, like Mr. Yoshida in this article, should be a necessary condition.</p>
<p>The questions he answered can be summarized into two: First, the relationship between the international powers and China and East Asia, and second, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>In terms of international relations, regarding the enemy's future movements, he clearly put forward three points: "If the United States launches large-scale operations in Japan and China at the same time, it is something that neither manpower nor transportation can allow." "No matter how great the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are, their outbreak will have to wait until the end of the anti-Japanese war." "The Pacific War has reached the final decisive stage today, and Japan will never conclude a compromise with Britain and the United States." These conclusions are generally correct. In particular, the second and third points can correct the illusions of some people, mistakenly believing that the British and American teams will conflict, and that Japan and the United States may compromise, forgetting their solemn stance of participating in the war for the East Asia of the East Asians. This is a very timely iron correction. However, it seems that the first point, whether the United States will never launch landing operations on the Chinese mainland, is still difficult to say. We must not be negligent in the slightest with regard to all the activities of the enemy! As for Mr. Yoshida's explanation of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Pacific War, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chongqing, it is very accurate and there is no need for us to add any more words.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party, Mr. Yoshida very objectively analyzed the class, economic, and international relations characteristics of the Communist Party, pointing out that although the Soviet Union will not turn China into a second Spain and will try to avoid this happening, the Communist Party will inevitably adhere to the anti-Chongqing struggle, and Chongqing, in order to unify China and realize an independent and strong force between the Soviet Union and the United States, will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to become another country within the country. This is an inevitable trend. Here, with regard to the struggle between Chongqing and the Communist Party, in addition to producing heartache for the country and the nation, we can only step up the promotion of innovative politics and improved people's livelihood movements in the peaceful areas in order to promote true independence.</p>
<p>In terms of the current overall situation, we do not allow Britain and the United States to move on the Chinese mainland, nor do we allow Chongqing and the Communist Party to poison our people for private disputes. The only way out is to gather the public opinion of the people of the whole country, create a force, seek internal unity and national salvation, and cooperate with the Allied countries externally. We believe that only when the Chinese problem is completely resolved can the East Asian war be completed; conversely, the solution to the Chinese problem is also inseparable from the victory of the East Asian war. Therefore, we hope that both the Chinese and Japanese governments and peoples will work more closely together, overcome difficulties, and move forward!</p>
<h3>Japan's Special Attack Tactics Achieve Significant Results: Military Commentators Analyze the Battle of Okinawa</h3>
<p>A military commentator in Shanghai recently reviewed the Battle of Okinawa before and after, stating that the land battle on Okinawa Island has come to an end, but the Japanese air force and special attack units are still continuing to fiercely attack the enemy fleet around Okinawa, so the naval battle is still in progress. The land battle has ended as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. After eighty days of fighting, the Japanese army fought bravely and skillfully with fewer troops against the enemy's superior forces. It is unfortunate that the island was captured by the enemy. From the perspective of the Japanese strategic aspect, the Okinawa operation has achieved considerable results. The past battles on the island also give us some lessons for future operations, which can be used as a mirror. The following is a brief description:</p>
<p>Lessons Learned from the Okinawa Operation</p>
<p>The enemy's operations are scientific, and the first characteristic is the power of its supply fleet. The supply distance is inversely proportional to the combat power. The US military's attack on Okinawa is a very long distance, and there should be problems strategically, but in order to overcome this difficulty, the US military dispatched the Tenth and Sixth Supply Fleets, which constantly transported supplies.</p>
<p>The second phenomenon is the strengthening of repair capabilities. The US military has built large docks for repairing naval vessels on the Pacific coast, and also uses floating docks to dispatch to the closest point on the front line to repair damaged ships quickly. More than 600 US ships have been sunk or damaged. Usually, 80% of the ships should have suffered damage, but the fact that they were still able to complete their operational tasks must be attributed to the strength of the supply power.</p>
<p>The third is the high degree of mechanization of the engineer and construction units. Regardless of the size of the landing area, the US military's engineers quickly built fortifications after landing, allowing the air force and artillery to be used, thus gaining all the conveniences and air superiority in operations. In addition, the large number of high-performance mechanized units stationed in the fortifications is also one of its characteristics. Its amphibious tanks were used extensively after landing. Flame-throwing tanks and "rocket" artillery are also deployed on the front line. This kind of use of chemistry and quantity is what the Americans boast about the most. We cannot underestimate it; however, how to use it still depends on manpower, so the exertion of its power also has a certain limit, just like the supply fleet, its ability is also limited.</p>
<p>The Enemy Encounters Difficulties in the Mainland Operation</p>
<p>The troop strength used for Okinawa was seven divisions on land, about 100,000 people, 1,400 ships at sea, and about 420,000 personnel, with a total of more than 2,300 ships used. Steirnil once said: If fighting on the Japanese mainland, at least 500,000 troops are required. It can be seen that the supply ships required will exceed 10,000. American military commentator Xie Li said: The US landing operation on the Japanese mainland, even if the largest supply fleet is used, is not enough. It can be seen that the difficulties in fighting on the Japanese mainland are very heavy. Moreover, Japan has a large number of troops on the Chinese mainland, so the beach landing operation on the Chinese mainland is even more difficult. The need for repair capabilities during operations is unlimited and beyond human comparison. Japan's annihilation tactics will definitely be expanded in the future, so the enemy's repair capabilities will inevitably become a major problem. Also, we cannot underestimate the mechanized units mentioned in the third and fourth points above, but we cannot overestimate them either.</p>
<p>The Enemy Has Difficulty Understanding Special Attack Tactics Regarding the lessons of the struggle between Japanese blood and life, what we can say is that the attacks by the special attack units have achieved great strategic results. The essence of the special attack is a guaranteed death and accurate attack. The destruction of one enemy warship with one aircraft has caused the British and American ships to be reduced by more than 600 ships, with personnel losses of more than 300,000. An enemy war correspondent said that the special attack tactics are tactics that the enemy cannot understand, and at the same time criticized the incompetence of the US military's operational command. An enemy military commentator said that under these special attack tactics, its losses at sea have exceeded its losses on land, so the Japanese special attack tactics have caused great threats to the enemy. Japan uses one aircraft to destroy one enemy ship and one person to kill hundreds of people. With Japan's abundant human resources, if this kind of tactic continues, it can cause major losses to the enemy's material and scientific forces, preventing them from exerting their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Facts Prove Who Will Win</p>
<p>The second is the strength of the Japanese fortifications. The cave fortifications created by the Japanese army in the mountainous areas are extremely effective in resisting the enemy's mechanized units. These fortifications in Makiminato and Kadena have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. In this area, fighting with the enemy has lasted for weeks, and both sides are often in a stalemate. As a result, the enemy had to move heavy artillery from the north to fight, and often entire divisions were wiped out. Also, two divisions of Marines were moved from the north to replenish losses. By the second half of the operation, Okinawa's control of the sea and air was unfortunately seized by the enemy, and it was impossible to replenish supplies, so as a result, Okinawa was captured by the enemy. If the enemy attacks the Japanese mainland, there will be mountains on land and an endless supply of reinforcements, which will surely make it difficult for the enemy to move an inch. The great decisive battle with Okinawa as the outpost is about to come. Britain and the United States will hold their quantity and science, and Japan will resist with its special qualities and geographical advantages. The quantity and quality of Britain and the United States have certain limits, while Japan does not. The struggle between the two, whose victory will belong to, will be proven by facts in the future. Looking at the above points, Japan will undoubtedly win.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Decides to Implement Flour and Grain Rationing</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) – Governor Ren is extremely concerned about the food problem. In addition to the fact that the sale of rice has been ordered to stop purchasing, abolishing control, which has been transferred to the county governments for compliance, he also ordered Jianbi to convene a symposium of the directors of the grain and flour industry associations of each region the day before yesterday, deciding to implement the rationing of flour and miscellaneous grains to provide staple food for the people. It is reported that there are many small flour mills in the province. In the past, due to the lack of proper management, the prices of raw materials purchased by each factory and the sale of flour were not statistically recorded. Now, a temporary method for managing small flour mills in the province has been formulated and implemented. In the future, the government will provide assistance and convenience in purchasing raw materials, which will reduce costs, increase production, and stabilize the food problem.</p>
<h3>34th Division Clears Bandits</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) – The 34th Division of the Army, in view of the bandits' disturbances and the people's suffering, has launched a campaign to suppress the bandits since the 14th. The enemy has repeatedly retreated. After our army occupied Linghu Xiaang and other places, it continued to advance and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy for days. Thanks to the bravery of our soldiers, the enemy suffered great losses. The bandits and puppets who occupy the key points are still rampant. In order to achieve the purpose of clearing them out, the division launched a struggle and advanced rapidly, successively capturing Qianjinshi Tomb, Nanshang Village, Lingshan and other important strongholds. The bandits and puppets, after this setback, fled in panic. The division is currently in pursuit. In addition, the waterway line from Huzhou to Luoshe has been navigated by ships due to the suppression of bandits and puppets by the division, and it will soon be able to directly reach Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>Bose's Overnight Broadcast: Criticizing British Policy, Urging Indians to Seize Independence</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Syonan, 28th – The Indian Provisional Government of Free India, recently due to the drastic changes in the Burma war situation, was forced to discuss relocation to the rear. The British attitude towards India, also due to the end of the European war, is actively attempting to win over India with favorable conditions. As a result, the future of the Provisional Government's independence movement is encountering a major obstacle. The "Wavell Plan," the new policy towards India recently proposed by Britain, is essentially the same as the Cripps Proposal of three years ago, which only granted autonomy in form without actual independence. These are all hypocritical policies. However, some key figures in India, based on objective circumstances, hope to accept this new proposal. Therefore, the current issue is no longer just the Provisional Government, but also all major issues affecting the domestic and foreign independence struggle of India, and its future, will also encounter significant changes. The Provisional Government is now gathering the combined strength of military officers and civilians to overcome the difficulties of the current situation in order to liberate the motherland. Its supreme leader, Bose, since the 19th of this month, has personally broadcast overnight via wireless radio in North Indian, Bengali, and English, vehemently criticizing British policy towards India, and loudly appealing to remind comrades in India to actively launch a political offensive. The main points of his broadcast to India are roughly as follows: We must consider the motive of the Wavell Plan, its purpose being to deceive Indians and use Indian blood and sweat to complete Britain's war of aggression in East Asia. We must pay attention to the deceptive nature of the proposal. The phrase "future independence" in the proposal has not resulted in the recognition of the proposal. The only thing the Congress Party has gained is membership in the Executive Council. Furthermore, the power to appoint members of the Council and the right to reject decisions are still held by the Governor-General of India. The new proposal calls for Indians to hold internal affairs portfolios, but the Commander-in-Chief will still be a Briton, and British war demands will exploit Indians through various means. To complete the war against Japan, Britain has no choice but to encompass Indian resources. However, to extract from India, which has already suffered enormous sacrifices, it is necessary to win over the National Congress Party to ensure its full cooperation with Britain. The greatest emphasis of the Wavell Plan lies in this. The new proposal has stated that equal treatment will be given to the two Indian parties in the Executive Council, maintaining a certain number of seats, while other seats can be freely directed by the Governor-General, so the Governor-General can freely win over any party. If the current proposal is recognized, it means that the powerful Congress Party itself is abandoning the glory of representing India's own independence movement and degrading itself to the status of a small party. I dare to ask a question to the compatriots who support the recognition of the proposal: "Where will our goal of complete independence go? What will be the result of the decision of 1942 that Britain immediately withdraw?" We must warn against pessimists and defeatists. We must carefully consider the value of the blood and sweat sacrifices of our compatriots. The Free India National Army must "persist in fighting to the last man and the last moment." I hope that the people of the whole country, regardless of the outcome of the overall war situation, must step up the struggle for the independence of all of India.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Makes Two Demands on Turkey: Big Three Conference to Discuss</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 28th – A Swiss newspaper reported on the 27th, according to a dispatch from Ankara, that after the Soviet government abandoned the Soviet-Turkish treaty, it had proposed the following two conditions when concluding a new treaty: The Soviet Union monitors the Dardanelles Strait. Modify the Soviet-Turkish border. The Soviet government has communicated these two cases to the Turkish ambassador in Moscow and the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the form of a memorandum. Regarding the Dardanelles Strait monitoring issue, because of its great relationship with Britain and the United States, Turkey must consult with the governments of the United States and Britain before it can respond. Such conditions may be unacceptable to Turkey. Furthermore, the Soviet government previously requested that Turkey transfer the two places of Kars and Ardahan in eastern Turkey to the Soviet Union. This will also be unacceptable to Turkey. Therefore, with the Soviet Union's request as an opportunity, Soviet-Turkish relations will tend to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 28th – According to Reuters correspondent Kish, the Soviet Union has made a request to Turkey to discuss the issue of revising the management of the Dardanelles Strait as stipulated in the Montreux Convention. However, this issue may also be discussed in detail at the Big Three conference. Because this issue includes many other important and complex situations, the British government, as a signatory to the strait's regulations, has not received any notification from the Soviet Union to Turkey requesting a re-discussion, causing outsiders to have suspicions. However, according to speculation in London diplomatic circles, the Soviet Union's proposal to Turkey this time is no different from the situation when the Soviet Union concluded an agreement with Romania on the mouths of the Danube River. Therefore, it is clear that the Soviet Union's suggestion is to abolish the current Soviet-Turkish agreement on jointly managing the Strait, and wants to station Soviet troops in areas related to Soviet interests. However, it is now generally believed that in the upcoming Berlin Big Three Conference, not only will the Dardanelles Strait issue be discussed, but also the management of the Dodecanese and Aegean islands will be brought up for discussion.</p>
<h3>Stalin Promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Mayor Zhou Orders Police Bureau to Investigate Discounting Offenders: All Economic Police Mobilized for Secret Investigation</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of discounting allocation slips, all sectors are quite concerned, and all hope that the authorities will strictly crack down on it and take appropriate measures to solve it thoroughly. However, some illegal merchants still defy laws and regulations, secretly engaging in illegal discounting transactions, so that the discounting trend has not only failed to subside, but in the past two days, the discounting rate has even risen to a huge sum of 28 cents per yuan, threatening people's livelihoods and having a significant impact. It is learned that Mayor Zhou has made the greatest determination to resolutely deal with these illegal merchants. He has instructed the Economic Security Section of the Municipal Police Bureau to actively crack down on it. Whether it is silver money firms, or other money exchange firms, or even Central Reserve Bank staff, or other firm staff, if they do receive discounts when issuing cash or have illegal discounting behavior, they can be severely investigated. After receiving the order, Section Chief Hong Demao immediately met with Deputy Section Chief Pu Xia, and mobilized all economic police to conduct secret investigations and investigate and deal with all improper discounting behavior in the financial industry, and apply Article 344 of the Criminal Law on usury exploitation. According to Article 344 of the Criminal Law, whoever takes advantage of another's urgency, recklessness, or inexperience to lend money or other items, and obtains an excessive profit that is significantly disproportionate to the principal, shall be sentenced to imprisonment of one year or less.</p>

<p>This Year's Household Ration Flour Will Be Maintained Monthly: Interview with the Person in Charge of the Flour Control Association</p>
<p>In today's severe food problem, although the government authorities have issued emergency rice and grain measures, and the situation has improved slightly, it is still three or four months away from the new rice harvest. During this so-called lean season when rice and grain are fundamentally lacking, the people's food can only be supplemented by flour and coarse grains. To this end, the reporter visited Mr. Inoue, Deputy Director of the Flour and Wheat Control Association, but he was away on business, so Secretary-General Wang Xiaoshui met with him. The reporter asked questions, and he replied as follows: (Q) It is heard that the wheat harvest is very good this year. I don't know if your association has started purchasing it? (A) The wheat harvest is indeed very abundant this year, but the purchase plan for the end of the year is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan before it can be implemented. It is estimated that about 350,000 tons can be collected. (Q) Last year's flour results were very satisfactory? (A) Last year's wheat flour production situation, due to the stimulation of wheat prices by other commodity prices, continued to rise, coupled with transportation difficulties and power restrictions, the flour production volume ultimately failed to meet expectations, so we do not hesitate to say that we do not consider the results of last year to be satisfactory. (Q) Now that the rice and grain have reached the lean season, the public hopes that flour and coarse grains will be supplemented. Can your association increase household ration flour? (A) Our association has always done its best to provide for the people's food needs. This year's household ration flour will still be maintained monthly, with at least one allocation, and will never be interrupted. In the future, we will continue to maintain it to avoid interruption. As for increasing the amount of allocated flour, we will still try our best to comfort the people. (Q) Key allocation of rice and grain is now hopeless. I don't know if flour can also be allocated? (A) The association's reserve of flour is as mentioned above, so key allocation, while maintaining household allocation, seems beyond our ability. However, in order to take care of the military camps and administrative personnel in this city that are related to public security, after consultation with the relevant parties, we have provided the greatest cooperation, giving more than 10,000 bags. It is a complete exertion.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Bills Receivable and Payable in the Silver Money Industry Doubles</h3>
<p>In the current situation of cash shortage in this city, the amount of bills receivable and payable in the silver money industry has been increasing day by day. The number of bills per day has also created an unprecedented record. The banking industry averages about 100,000 bills per day, and the money industry averages about 50,000 bills per day. It is learned that although the receipt and payment of bills by various firms has been assigned to designated firms to share their affairs, the trial operation of receiving bills is still in the initial stage. The total transfer work of the bank's union money quasi-treasury is extremely busy. In addition, due to time constraints, the accounting departments of each association often have difficulty keeping up. If cash is still not fully supplied in the future, and the allocation slip is discontinued and replaced with bank drafts, the number of bills receivable and payable in the banking and money industries will still be large, and the amount of the clearing and payment account will also be inevitably reduced.</p>
<h3>Increase in Fees for Applying for Material Movement</h3>
<p>The Material Movement Permit Office of the National Commercial Control Association originally charged a material movement application permit fee at 1% of the application amount to cover the association's expenses. It is now learned that the office, under the command of the Chamber of Commerce, has decided to increase the amount of the administrative fee and will begin on the 1st of next month, uniformly charging 3% of the application amount.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Industry Association Limited to Establish Within One Month</h3>

<h3>Water Company Facilitates User Payment</h3>

<h3>All Counties in the City Strengthen Baojia Work: County Administration Office Baojia Meeting to Discuss Plan</h3>
<p>It is found that the baojia work is closely related to people's organization, social order, and local public security, and it is the most important work in the county government departments. During the administrative meeting held by the County Administration Office this time, the issues of determining the baojia expenses and strengthening the baojia work proposed by the county magistrates and district office chiefs were listed as the central topics and were highly valued. After separate and thorough discussions, they were approved. In addition to the part on determining expenses that has been submitted by the County Administration Office to the government for approval, the office and the Municipal Baojia Committee are also discussing plans on how to strengthen the baojia and how to train and adjust autonomous personnel, which will be submitted for review and implementation.</p>

<h3>Li Xianglan on the Art of Singing</h3>
<p>— Hai Yan</p>
<p>Miss Li Xianglan held a solo concert at the Grand Guangming Theater, publicly performing songs for three days, resulting in a "streets emptied" sensation. This is an internationally renowned artist: her accomplishments and success in singing, as well as her experiences and insights into singing, must be welcomed and valued by those who love singing!</p>
<p>Miss Li is a diligent, studious, and humble artist who always leaves everyone with the same impression, regardless of whether they are close or casual friends. Although still young, she has already achieved extraordinary accomplishments. Her singing seems to have spread throughout various countries and regions. People are even curious about her nationality. Koreans say she is Korean; Taiwanese and Manchurians say she is Taiwanese and Manchurian; Japanese and Soviets say she is Japanese and Soviet; and Chinese people, in turn, say she is Chinese. When this issue was mentioned, she said, "I am truly grateful for everyone's warm and generous love. To be frank, my company is in Manchuria, my parents are in Beijing, I studied singing in Tokyo, and I film movies in Shanghai. I wander around, and to put it playfully, I should say that I belong to Asia!" This is such a witty response.</p>
<p>Speaking of her formal study of singing, it began at the age of seventeen, with intermittent learning, and some time spent entirely on filming movies. Until recent years, due to her interest, she became particularly enthusiastic about singing again. She has studied with many musicians of different nationalities, and she is almost constantly learning and seeking progress. Her attitude toward learning is serious, conscientious, passionate, and always humble, never complacent. She has a sweet, broad, and bright voice gifted by nature. She can sing the highest scales of the soprano range on the piano. Although this is a great endowment, it also comes from diligent study and training. She also has a strong memory and can sing lyrics in different dialects of various countries: Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, German, French, Italian... Using her multifaceted talent and wisdom, she cultivates a unique ability. She said that when she learns something, she wants to be like it, striving for absolute accuracy and purity. The number of songs she can sing is not necessarily large, but she must achieve "learning something and being like something," completely like a native singing their native song. This is truly a spirit of perseverance and meticulous learning!</p>
<p>She also provided methods and essential conditions for learning to sing, which are also worth learning from. She said that the singing method of ordinary people is mostly from the throat, but those who have a considerable foundation and level of singing will understand how to extract the energy from the dantian (lower abdomen). With abundant and full energy, the singing voice will naturally be deep and mellow, and the tail sounds will also have endless lingering charm. When singing, one must pay attention to articulation and vocalization, and also infuse genuine emotions so that the timbre is beautiful and the singing is pleasant and moving. However, good physical strength, good mental state, and sufficient energy are also indispensable conditions for excellent singers.</p>
<p>As for her experience in learning to sing, she also contributed a valuable insight. She said that when most people learn to sing, they always attribute their success or failure to the teacher, saying that the teacher teaches well or poorly. In fact, the teacher always has some strengths. The whole problem lies in whether the student can truly understand, whether they can fully absorb, or rather, whether they know how to "seize" the essence within and digest it into their own possession. And they must also be able to understand and emulate the meaning of the song, infuse emotion and soul, and then the singing can be controlled freely and reach perfection. This is also an attitude of being loyal to scholarship and learning seriously!</p>
<p>When asked about her mood when performing, her answer was: When I stand on the stage, my heart is filled with tears of gratitude. I feel that if I don't sing well, I will be sorry for everyone, and I will not be worthy of receiving everyone's warm love. She added: I only want to be an artist who belongs to the public (not the patent of the rich)—that is, her achievement in singing. This points out such an accurate path for the future of singing!</p>
<p>Recently, she will hold a performance of Soviet operetta and is also rushing to shoot a film centered on opera, "Night Blooming Cereus." It is said that she has also agreed to do a charity performance for this newspaper to raise scholarships!</p>
<p>Finally, talking about the future of Chinese song, she expressed: Although the Chinese music scene is still relatively immature, like an emerging art, it has only been widely valued and loved in recent years, it is making progress and full of hope.</p>
<p>In short, Miss Li Xianglan is an artist with a clear outlook on life, a firm view on her career, loyalty to art, and a desire for progress. We wish her a limitless future! At the same time, we also encourage the artists who follow.</p>
