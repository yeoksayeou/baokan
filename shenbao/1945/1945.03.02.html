<h3 id="c8">中國經濟解救之道 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>日本朝日新聞二月七日社評，題爲「中國經濟復興之道」。對於中國經濟的現狀，以及病態病根，都具有很透澈的見解，因此論列頗見適切。譬如說，中國之窮，由於生產萎縮，物價暴漲，統制紊亂等等經濟病態，都足以阻塞中國經濟復興之道。在此大東亞戰爭的決戰階段，凡是參戰國家都需做到資源戰力化，可是，中國目前的經濟現况並不能配合這種需要，不但盟邦感到可慮，我們尤其覺得焦急。</p>
<p>目前與其說中國經濟復興之這，倒不如先謀中國經濟的病態不再加深，比較實際有效。朝日新聞在社評中說：「由於此次對華新經濟施策，各機關割據主義之弊當可打破，具有中國經濟參謀本部性質的一元機構亦可實現。收買，配給，販賣，運輸都可以集中處理，加强推進。這是足以針對問題的核心。統制的範圍，自收買工作擴大强化，及於生產與運輸，可謂較前所施的政策進步已多。」由此而觀，日本對華新經濟政策的內容，也以先經救中國經濟病態爲目標，而經濟統制的一元機構，無論在任何方面觀察，已經是必要的步驟。戰時統制經濟已爲參戰國家必要的經濟政策，統制機構的一元化，乃爲强化收貢，並擴大及於生產運輸，健全與完備統制經濟的內容，然後統制經濟才能收效，才能完成其對於戰爭及民生的有利。</p>
<p>朝日新聞社評又說：「對於職力的貢獻，不得與民生的安定，背道而馳。惟有如此，對華新政策始得有其完全的意義，對華新政策未能如其吆喝聲的高響入雲一般，深深透入中國的民心，即因現實上未能予以利益。因此，不尙虛言而重實行，極爲必要。無論任何崇高的精神或理念，單憑言凋必無把握民心的力量。」</p>
<p>這種意見正與我們完全相同，我們向來主張在中國一切的經濟措置，最主要的必須適合中國的國情與民情，唯有如此，才能成爲把握民心的力量。其次，在中國的經濟措置，必須帮助中國官民自發自動去做。誠如華中振興公司高島總裁昨（一日）在新聞報發表談話中說：「日本人固然都想協力中國，可是，能够實行策劃的是很少，中國人處理中國的經濟，才能够不背中國固有的人情風俗，那末，事務的推行，就能圖滑化。倘若中國人能够自動的做，也就是日本人相助一樣，所以，關於經濟處理，日本人固希望協力，但並不是日本人去做，而應是中國人自己處理。」又如日本對華新經濟政策內容大要第四項：「日本雖盡可能盡力援助，但各種經濟活動應全由中國方面獨立自主，參服同盟條約的條款，亦屬理所當然。」前者是日本在華經濟界權威的意見，後者更是日本最高當局的表示，對於中國經濟由中國自動辦理一點，所見完全相同，這是今後解救中國經濟病態的對症良藥。因此，我們聯想到目前上海的米價，已經超過每石十萬元，這樣威脅民生的經濟上嚴重危機，中日當局應該怎樣根據上述的意思設法有效解救？更是最現實最迫切的課題。</p>
<h3 id="c9">日本對華　新經濟策槪要　振興生產增強運輸力量協助國府安定物價民生 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>爲了强化中日滿的紐帶，鞏固後方體制，對於爲其一環的中國，日本政府在和國民政府密切聯繫之下，使中國經濟徹底自强，且使其在資源戰力化時保持合理性。故自去秋以來，即以大東亞省爲中心，與國府聯繫，攷究其對策。至去年十二月中旬，在東京召集谷大使以下張家口·北京·上海·廣東各大使館事務所長舉行連絡商討會議後，復經閣議裁可，遂確立所謂「對華新經濟政策」，這政策由重光外相兼大東亞相先後在這次議會答覆衆議院預算總會田中貢氏，五日責族院預算總會阪谷希一子爵。大藏公望男爵等的質問中·逐漸明白其槪要。</p>
<p>這政策的目的，在圖　本重建難題山積的中國經濟，要由　開其難關，以貫澈中日同盟條約　大東亞共同宣言的旨趣，　中國　生的安定，藉此以求國府政治力的自强擴大，確保綜合物質精神的戰力，如是始可開拓在中日滿紐帶上極佔重要位置的中國經濟强力參加戰爭的大道。因此，國府自陳代主席以下的首腦部固已出動指揮，而日本中央政府方面亦由陸。海·大東亞，軍需等有關各省爲實施本政策而派出特定責任者及述絡官，互相通絡，採取一致的行動。</p>
<p>他方面，當地則由駐華大使，總軍司令官，中國方面派遣艦隊司令長官三者設置最高指導機關，其下以北京·張家口·上海·廣東各大使館事務所長爲中心，設立陸海軍各該地指揮官參預策劃的地方推行機關，由此前置機關渾然一體以事運營。就中關於調度遂行戰爭所必要的物資，陸·海。大東亞省的各個前置機關的步驟巳完全合拍，開始新的旅程。此事對於新政策有畫龍點睛之妙，深可期待</p>
<p>對華新經濟政策的大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）圓謀日本在華現地機構的一元化，確立右述三位一體的關係，保持各項經濟施策的統一性。</p>
<p>（二）一元擬定物資調度計劃，實施時顧及與當抵民需的關係，保持軍需民需合理的均衡。</p>
<p>（三）中國的運輸力受各方面莫大的牽制，固爲戰時必有的現象，但須努力維持培養之，並作物資調度與運輸力保持均衡的措置，且攷慮動員大帆船機帆船等中國固有運輸力的方法。</p>
<p>（四）日本雖盡可能全力援助，但各種經濟活動應全由中國方面獨立自主，參照同盟條約的條款，亦屬理所當然，而國府的創意和研究，尤多期待。對於煤·食糧及其他生活必需品，確保華方的絕對必要量，由此以岡消弭電力不够的問題，振興輕工業的生產，如此喚起常地經濟活動的意欲，使起自動的經濟循環活動。</p>
<p>（五）擁讓現在的通貨制度，絕對維持儲備劵一百元對日金十八元的匯兌率。此外，爲收回通貨以防惡性膨脹將見，覓取劃期的方法。此點中日兩政府間目下正在進行協議。</p>
<p>（六）關於在華日僑的使命，此際再作根本檢討，對於日僑企業及國策公司的活動，大加刷新。（譯自二月七日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>代表破土。到有警局副局長渡正監，防空本部主任秘書曹今港，總務處長野口，消防處長清手水見，保甲處長顧　武，警察總隊長塜崎，防空科長山本眞一郎，副科長李振實，以及各區保甲委員陳福康，余犀敬等，各區聯保長及保甲人員，黃浦區防空警察官員，各聯保長及名聯保防空保甲人員等二百餘人，由黃浦分局副分局長劉亞英主席。儀式準時開始，由劉副長致開會詞及局市長代表羅秘書長致訓詞後，旋由羅秘書長先行破土儀式，即告完成，黃浦區保甲人員即於劉副局長領導下，開始工作。</p>
<p>劉副局長致開會詞</p>
<p>「諸今天是本分局管內開始建築公共模範防空壕之日，記得本年二月五日下午八時，前第二處副處長薛志良，已曾在上海電台向諸位及全上海市民廣播，解釋建藥防空壕之意義及其重要性，並且在次日的報紙上亦轉載過，想諸位亦已聆悉，本人今天再來補充數點。蓋一旦上海遭受重大空製，大量炸彈落下時，彈片固足以殺人，但其爆裂所產生之風力，亦足以致人於死，故雖未受彈片繫中，但人身之內部，勢必受高速度風力猛震而致重傷，甚至於因而遭受非命，所穿着之衣服亦必致裂碎無餘。此際立於地面上者，雖可立即仆倒地上，藉減受傷程度，惟較諸避於防空壕內者實危險多矣。蓋進於防空壕內，除直接被擊中外，可謂最安全避難處所，而受直接命中之機會究竟非常微小。局市長就任以來，對於市民之安全，關心非凡，故特發起建設防空壕週，希望市民一致奮起，努力是項防空壕之建設，用市民自己的力量，來保護自己，才能免將來因空襲而產生之危險，這就是今天本分局管內起始建築之意義。同時爲喚起市民全體注意，是項建設之重要性起見，特恭請市長主持破土典禮，市長因公未克親臨，由羅秘書長代表，祈各防空團員及市民等在市長領導之下，從速完成此項具有重大意義之工作，不勝盼切之至。最後本人還得代表黃浦區市民向上海特別市籐柳革業同業公會及該會理事長黃竹安先生表示謝意，蓋建防空壕之竹料等都爲該公會捐贈。」</p>
<p>市長訓詞</p>
<p>繼由羅秘爲長代表周市長訓詞，略謂：「各位：今天本人以市府秘書長的資格，代表市長在這裏舉行模範防空壕破土典禮，同時講幾句簡單的話。在戰爭一天天緊張的當前，任何一個國人，自己都要具有沉着應戰的決心，建築防空壕也是應付戰局決心的一種，其重要性已經一再有防空當局及本人說過，務須有備無患，有了充實的準備必能損害滅少，其意議諒每一市民都能確切明瞭。本市保甲人員均已受嚴格訓練，對防空措置都甚熟練，且均俱熱忱，努力服務，已有顧著之成績，今後更望努力防空，貢獻一切，保衛大上海之安全。」</p>

<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The anti-Axis powers are constantly researching to estimate Japan's war power. In particular, the United States has countless evaluators of Japan's war power. The following are the major ones: The US military authorities unanimously acknowledge that Japan possesses immense new military strength. Lieutenant General Stilwell, head of the US Army Ground Forces, based on his experience in Chongqing, declared on January 30 that Japan has 4 million troops that can be deployed to the front lines. The new Under Secretary of the Navy, H. Struve Hensel, warned on February 7 when discussing Japanese military equipment and air power, that Japanese aircraft and weapons are gradually increasing, the closer the US military gets to the Japanese mainland, the greater the damage it will suffer, and the US military must be wary of attacks from new Japanese weapons, rocket shells, and jet-propelled fighters. British military journalist John Cremer, regarding the terrible aspects of Japanese military power, made the following points: (1) The Japanese army has not yet suffered a decisive defeat; (2) Its human resources are immense; (3) Most of its field army consists of new recruits who have not yet participated in actual combat; (4) Its aircraft production volume has ample surplus in addition to replacing losses; (5) Japan is planning to turn the Chinese mainland into a major fortress. Regarding Japan's productivity, US Secretary of the Air Force Arnold declared on January 13 that Japan has acquired unprecedented resources in the Pacific region, and its highly developed agricultural and industrial sectors are sufficient for self-sufficiency, its scale being three times that of Germany. Regarding human resources and morale, Stilwell said on January 20 that Japan is a country with extremely high productivity, and it does not feel any difficulty in the loss of soldiers, which shows that it feels Japanese human resources are abundant. According to a report released by the War Information Bureau on the 21st, regarding the various living conditions in Japan, it concluded that although Japan has been engaged in war for many years, the difficulties have increased, and the attacks of the anti-Axis powers have become more intense, the people and the government are united as one, and there is no sign of frustration in morale.</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Way to Rescue the Chinese Economy <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun of Japan published an editorial on February 7th titled "The Way to Revive the Chinese Economy". It has very insightful views on the current state of the Chinese economy, as well as its pathologies and root causes, and therefore its discussion is quite appropriate. For example, China's poverty, due to shrinking production, skyrocketing prices, chaotic controls, and other economic pathologies, are all sufficient to block the path to China's economic revival. In this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, all participating countries need to make their resources battle-ready, but China's current economic situation cannot meet this need. Not only are the allied nations worried, but we are especially anxious.</p>
<p>Currently, rather than talking about China's economic revival, it is more practical and effective to first prevent the deepening of China's economic pathologies. The Asahi Shimbun said in its editorial: "Thanks to this new economic policy towards China, the drawbacks of sectionalism in various agencies can be broken, and a unified institution with the nature of a Chinese economic staff headquarters can be realized. Procurement, allocation, sales, and transportation can all be centrally handled and strengthened. This is sufficient to address the core of the problem. The scope of control has been expanded and strengthened from procurement to production and transportation, which can be said to be a greater advance than previous policies." From this perspective, the content of Japan's new economic policy towards China also aims to first rescue China's economic pathologies, and a unified institution for economic control is a necessary step, no matter how it is observed. Wartime controlled economy is a necessary economic policy for participating countries, and the unification of control institutions is to strengthen revenue and expand to production and transportation, improve and perfect the content of controlled economy, and then the controlled economy can be effective and fulfill its benefits for war and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun editorial also said: "Contributions to occupational duties must not run counter to the stability of people's livelihood. Only in this way can the new policy towards China have its full meaning. The reason why the new policy towards China has not deeply penetrated the hearts of the Chinese people as loudly as its shouts reach the clouds is that it has failed to provide them with real benefits. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to value action over empty words. No matter how lofty the spirit or ideals are, relying solely on rhetoric will not have the power to grasp people's hearts."</p>
<p>This opinion is exactly the same as ours. We have always maintained that in all economic measures in China, the most important thing is to suit the national conditions and popular feelings of China. Only in this way can it become a force for grasping people's hearts. Secondly, economic measures in China must help Chinese officials and people to do it spontaneously and automatically. As Mr. Takashi, president of the Central China Development Company, said in an interview published in the News Report yesterday (1st): "The Japanese certainly want to cooperate with China, but very few can implement plans. Only when the Chinese handle China's economy can they not go against China's inherent human customs, so that the promotion of affairs can be smoothly carried out. If the Chinese can do it automatically, it is the same as the Japanese helping. Therefore, regarding economic handling, the Japanese hope to cooperate, but it should not be the Japanese doing it, but the Chinese themselves." Another example is the fourth item of the main points of Japan's new economic policy towards China: "Although Japan will do its best to assist, all economic activities should be independently and autonomously conducted by the Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the alliance treaty." The former is the opinion of the Japanese economic authority in China, and the latter is the statement of the highest Japanese authorities. They completely agree that the Chinese should automatically handle the Chinese economy. This is a remedy for solving China's economic pathologies in the future. Therefore, we are reminded of the current rice price in Shanghai, which has exceeded 100,000 yuan per koku. How should the Chinese and Japanese authorities effectively solve this serious economic crisis that threatens people's livelihood according to the above-mentioned meaning? This is the most realistic and urgent issue.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Outline of Japan's New Economic Policy Toward China: Promoting Production, Strengthening Transportation Power, Assisting the National Government in Stabilizing Prices and People's Livelihood <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the ties between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and consolidate the rear area system, the Japanese government, in close contact with the National Government, is making China self-reliant and maintaining its rationality in the utilization of resources. Therefore, since last autumn, the Ministry of Greater East Asia has been at the center, contacting the National Government and studying its countermeasures. In mid-December of last year, after convening a liaison and discussion meeting in Tokyo with ambassadors and directors of offices from major embassies and offices in Zhangjiakou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, it was approved by the cabinet and established the so-called "New Economic Policy toward China". This policy was gradually clarified by Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu in his replies to Mr. Tanaka Kou of the House of Representatives Budget Committee and Viscount Sakatani Kiichi and Baron Okura Koubou of the House of Peers Budget Committee.</p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to overcome the difficulties of rebuilding China's economy, which is full of difficult problems, and to thoroughly implement the principles of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, to stabilize the people's livelihood in China, thereby seeking to strengthen and expand the National Government's political power, and to ensure comprehensive material and spiritual combat power. Only in this way can we open up the road for the Chinese economy, which occupies a very important position in the ties between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, to powerfully participate in the war. Therefore, the heads of the National Government, from Chairman Chen Dai onwards, have mobilized to command, and the Japanese central government has also dispatched specific persons in charge and liaisons from the relevant ministries, such as the Army, Navy, Ministry of Greater East Asia, and Ministry of Military Affairs, to implement this policy, communicate with each other, and take concerted action.</p>
<p>On the other hand, locally, the ambassador to China, the commander-in-chief of the general army, and the commander-in-chief of the dispatched fleet in China will set up the highest guidance agency, under which the directors of the major embassies and offices in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou will be at the center, and local implementation agencies will be established with the participation of the local commanders of the army and navy. All the above agencies will be integrated to operate the policy. Among them, regarding the allocation of materials necessary to carry out the war, the steps of the forward agencies of the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Greater East Asia have been fully aligned and a new journey has begun. This is the finishing touch to the new policy and is highly anticipated.</p>
<p>The main points of the new economic policy towards China are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To unify the local agencies of Japan in China, establish the three-in-one relationship mentioned above, and maintain the uniformity of various economic measures.</p>
<p>(2) To formulate a unified material allocation plan, taking into account the relationship with local people's needs during implementation, and maintain a reasonable balance between military and civilian needs.</p>
<p>(3) China's transportation capacity is greatly constrained by various aspects, which is a necessary phenomenon in wartime, but efforts must be made to maintain and cultivate it, and measures must be taken to maintain a balance between material allocation and transportation capacity, and to consider methods of mobilizing China's inherent transportation capacity, such as large sailing ships and motorized sailing ships.</p>
<p>(4) Although Japan will do its best to assist, all economic activities should be independently and autonomously conducted by the Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the alliance treaty, and the National Government's creativity and research are especially expected. To ensure the absolute necessary amount of coal, food, and other necessities of life for the Chinese side, thereby eliminating the problem of insufficient electricity, revitalizing the production of light industry, and thus arousing the will of the normal economic activities in various regions and enabling it to start automatic economic cycle activities.</p>
<p>(5) To protect the current currency system and absolutely maintain the exchange rate of 100 yuan of reserve notes to 18 yuan of Japanese gold. In addition, in order to recover currency to prevent malignant inflation, a groundbreaking method will be sought. The two governments of China and Japan are currently negotiating on this point.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the mission of Japanese residents in China, a fundamental review will be made at this time, and the activities of Japanese-owned enterprises and national policy companies will be greatly reformed. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, February 7)</p>

<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcast to the German people on Wednesday evening, stating, "From a purely military perspective, the battle situation has changed suddenly due to the successful offensive of the Soviet forces from the Baranow bridgehead. Although our situation is currently very tense, it is not without hope. The misfortune suffered by the medical profession is indeed very painful, but it does not mean abandoning our determination to win. We have already built new defense lines on the Eastern Front. We are determined to recover the lost land. The war is not over, nor can it end like this. We will never give up our nation's right to survival, freedom, and future. We would rather die than surrender. Our military equipment and food potential have been greatly affected by the setbacks on the Eastern Front, but Germany can still continue to resist for an indefinite period. We must be more frugal than before and prepare to recover the lost land as soon as possible. To overcome the crisis, we must have the will to survive and not resign ourselves to fate. The enemy has also been repeatedly hit by our forces. Constant retaliatory weaponry has made the enemy find it unbearable and will greatly increase recently. German submarine warfare will also be resumed, on a scale unimaginable to the enemy. If we are resolute and unwavering, the enemy will never be able to defeat us. The enemy's camp is also not superior to ours. The Soviet Union estimates that its losses have exceeded 15 million people. This loss has a severe impact on the Soviet Union's chances in the war. The losses of the US military in this war have already doubled those of the last World War, and there is no hope of reducing them. As for Britain, it is not worth mentioning. Our nation is currently experiencing the most difficult test. I firmly believe that it will succeed. The tragedy of November 9, 1918, will never be repeated."</p>

<h3 id="e20">Model Air-raid Shelter Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Yesterday, Mayor Zhou Sends Secretary-General Luo as Representative <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Headquarters will implement "Air-Raid Shelter Propaganda Week" starting yesterday (1st), arousing the public to build air-raid shelters in order to prepare for emergencies and protect the lives of citizens. In addition to publishing the significance of building air-raid shelters in newspapers and showing slides promoting air-raid shelters in various theaters, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at 10 am yesterday for the construction of a public model air-raid shelter within the Huangpu District on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Mayor Zhou sent Secretary-General Luo as his representative to break ground. Those present included Deputy Police Chief Watanabe Masaru, Chief Secretary of the Air Defense Headquarters Cao Jingang, Chief of General Affairs Noguchi, Chief of Fire Department Shimizu Kensui, Chief of Baojia Department Gu Wu, Police Chief Tsukazaki, Chief of Air Defense Section Yamamoto Shinichiro, Deputy Chief Li Zhenshi, and various district Baojia members such as Chen Fukang and Yu Xijing, district Lianbao chiefs and Baojia personnel, Huangpu District air defense police officers, Lianbao chiefs and famous Lianbao air defense Baojia personnel, totaling more than 200 people, presided over by Deputy Director Liu Yaying of the Huangpu Branch Bureau. The ceremony began on time. Deputy Director Liu gave an opening speech, and Secretary-General Luo, representing the Mayor, gave an instruction speech. Then, Secretary-General Luo performed the groundbreaking ceremony, which was completed immediately. The Baojia personnel of Huangpu District began work under the leadership of Deputy Director Liu.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Liu's Opening Speech</p>
<p>"Everyone, today is the day when the construction of the public model air-raid shelter begins in the jurisdiction of our branch bureau. I remember that on February 5th of this year, at 8 pm, the former Deputy Chief of the Second Division, Xue Zhiliang, already broadcast to you and all the citizens of Shanghai on Shanghai Radio, explaining the significance and importance of building air-raid shelters, and it was also reprinted in the newspapers the next day. I believe you have all heard about it. Today, I will add a few points. Once Shanghai suffers a major air raid and a large number of bombs fall, shrapnel is certainly enough to kill people, but the wind force generated by the explosion is also enough to cause death. Therefore, even if you are not hit by shrapnel, the inside of your body will inevitably be severely injured due to the high-speed wind force, and may even suffer a violent death. The clothes you are wearing will also be torn to shreds. At this time, those standing on the ground can immediately fall to the ground to reduce the degree of injury, but it is much more dangerous than hiding in an air-raid shelter. Entering the air-raid shelter, except for being directly hit, can be said to be the safest place to take refuge, and the chance of being directly hit is very small. Since the Mayor took office, he has been extraordinarily concerned about the safety of citizens, so he specially initiated the Air-Raid Shelter Construction Week, hoping that citizens will rise up together and strive to build air-raid shelters, using their own strength to protect themselves, in order to avoid the dangers caused by air raids in the future. This is the meaning of the beginning of construction in the jurisdiction of our branch bureau today. At the same time, in order to arouse the attention of all citizens, and the importance of this construction, we especially respectfully invite the Mayor to preside over the groundbreaking ceremony. The Mayor was unable to attend due to official duties, and Secretary-General Luo is representing him. I pray that all air defense members and citizens will, under the leadership of the Mayor, quickly complete this work of great significance. Finally, I would also like to express my gratitude on behalf of the citizens of Huangpu District to the Shanghai Special City Rattan and Willow Trade Association and its Chairman, Mr. Huang Zhuan, because the bamboo materials for building the air-raid shelter were donated by the association."</p>
<p>Mayor's Instruction Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, then gave an instruction speech, roughly stating: "Everyone: Today, in my capacity as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, I am representing the Mayor here to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the model air-raid shelter, and I would like to say a few simple words. In the current situation of the increasingly tense war, every Chinese person must have the determination to calmly face the war. Building air-raid shelters is also a way to cope with the determination of the war, and its importance has been repeatedly stated by the air defense authorities and myself. We must be prepared for emergencies, and with sufficient preparation, we can reduce damage. The meaning of this is clearly understood by every citizen. The Baojia personnel of this city have all received rigorous training and are very familiar with air defense measures, and they are all enthusiastic and work hard, and have already achieved considerable results.

Starting in March, the rice allocation certificates for employees of municipal schools and centers will be designed in a different style to distinguish them from other allocation certificates. The price will still be temporarily paid as usual for the rice received in March. After the allocation is completed, each school and center will prepare three copies of the employee list and submit them to the Education Bureau for review by the Municipal Government, and the original rice payment will be collected and returned to the employees of each school and center.
