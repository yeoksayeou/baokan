<h3>慶祝勝利薄海騰歡　蔣主席廣播演說　宣布內政方針向建國大道邁進</h3>
<p>重慶三日電　蔣主席三日在慶祝勝利典禮時致詞，全文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞們！日本巳向我們聯合國家正式簽訂降書，世界反侵略戰爭至今巳經完全結束了。我們中國八年來艱辛的抗戰，到今天天算是達到了最後勝利的目的。今天是薄海騰歡的一天，也是我全國同胞在飽受艱難備嘗痛苦之餘，應該慶祝鼓舞的一天。我們遙祝　國父，吿慰我們中華民國開國導師在天之靈，也可以告慰國民革命先烈，和抗戰期中慷慨捐軀的軍民先烈之靈。</p>
<h3>永久保持光荣</h3>
<p>我全國軍民經過這八年來無比的痛苦和犧牲，　始結成今日光榮的果實，這一個光榮的果實，是全國同胞每一個人所應該十分尊重而保持的，只可使之發揚光大，不可使之有所損害以至於喪失。中正個人感懷過去全國的奮鬥。撫念當前的滿目　　，更覺得感想萬千，不知所云。在此從戰事到和平的緊要關頭，我們正與各盟邦結束五十年來日本侵略主義釀成的險惡局勢，共同締造東亞與世界普遍永久的和平與安全。我們更須在四隣親睦四境安定之中，收拾戰局恢復秩序，救濟收復區被難同胞，撫恤死傷軍民的遣族，安輯　　，醫治疾苦。</p>
<p>而且爲使過去犧牲眞正有代價，更必須在此時際，開創民主憲政的規模，鞏固國家統一的基礎。我全國同胞在過去會經團結一致，以支持抗戰爭取勝利，在今後必能團結一致，使民主與統一共底於成，使民生主義的政策與計　，在和平安定的社會環境之中，得以貫澈實施。</p>
<p>因此在薄海歡勝，同祝勝利之今日，　以國民政府關於內政最重要最具體的方針，陳述於我全國同胞之前，共資策　。</p>
<h3>減輕農工負擔</h3>
<p>第一，我們革命抗戰的目的，不只孤在戰勝敵人，並且要建立三民主義新中國。在此八年抗戰之中，我全國軍民歷盡艱辛，今當抗戰結束之後，全國同胞應有休養生息的機會。我們中國是以農立國的國家，全國人口大多數爲農民，其次爲工人，我們作戰部隊兵員的補給，以農民爲主要來源，而後方武器與民生物資的生產，以工人爲基幹，在此抗戰的綿長歲月之中，工商都市大抵殘破不堪，於是軍隊兵員的補充，與國家戰費的負担。乃大部份都落在農民的肩上。今當抗戰勝利結束之際，農民之服役者與工人之生產者，偕應使之早日減輕其義務與負担。國民政府體念及此，決定爲今日頒發明令，全國兵役自今日起，一律緩征一年，全國軍隊現役士兵，亦由軍政機關擬定退伍步驟分期實施。國民政府對於戰士授田的辦法，亦巳依照中國國民黨第六次全國代表大會所決定的綱領，次第訂定尅期實施。凡我會經陷敵各省，本年的的田賦一律豁免一年，後方各省亦定於明年度豁免田賦一年，並責成主管機關和地方政府，依照二五減租的原則，參酌各地實况，擬定減租辦法，限於本年十一月十二日以前，呈請國民政府核定予以實施。我們認爲必須農工有喘息之機，而後社會有蘇生之望，而且必須農村生活有提高的方法，而後工商都市有復興的基礎，所以國民政府爲全國同胞休養生息的最低限度辦法，不得不着重於農民與工人的負担之減輕，使其生活得以改善。至於其他積極方面，民生主義政　和政策之實施，國民政府自當視此為實現三民主義之首要，引爲政府今後最大之職責。</p>
<h3>提早實施憲政</h3>
<p>第二，抗戰結束之後，民主政治不容再緩。國民革命的最高理想是全民政治，實現理想的最要關鍵是還政于民，而國民大會是國民政府還政於民必經的階段，也就是國民革命必須完成的重要程序。在抗戰發動之初，我們預期抗戰勝利與憲政實施，畢其全功於一役，今當抗戰勝利結束之際，我們認為憲政實施愈早愈好，因此召開國民大會不可再事　延。我　切希望全國同胞與各方　達，能一致眞誠的爲國爲民，盡量協助政府這一個政策，促成國民大會的及早召開，以祈求民主政治的及早完成，決不可再事遷延。因爲抗戰結束的時期，正是建國大業開始的際會，政府施政的方針，必將本着至公，出以至誠，只要試在革命建國的最高原則，三民主義不致動搖，和中華民國國民政府的法統不致　亂的前提之下，一切問題無不可以推誠相見，共同商討，求得合理合法的解決。尤願社會　遠各黨領袖，均能參加政府，共策和平建國的百年大計，而在召開國民大會之前，政府甚願博訪周　，期無缺憾。就是國民大會的代表名額，和其他有關的問題，政府亦可順應與情，使之合理的增加和合法的解決。</p>
<h3>言論結社自由</h3>
<p>至於保障人民自由問題，國民政府除巳切實施行人身自由保障法以外，且巳決定　期取消新聞檢査制度，使人民有當論的自由，幷將制定公布政治結社法，使人民有結社的自由，務使各政黨偕有共同的軌轍，和合法的地位，如此民生政治始能追踪英美，以樹立五嚴懲法的典型。總之，我們要實現民主政治，必以法治爲懲政的基礎，以憲政爲民權的保障，軍閥時代以武力作政事，籍地盤以自固的惡習，早成過去，決不是現代民主國家所當有，亦不是和平建闕時代所許可，必使國內一切問題，皆從政治方法求得解決，各方意見恢復法律軌轍以爲標的，而後我革命先烈及全國同胞五十年來所共同祈求的根本大法，不至　　民國初年的覆轍，這是我們政府惟一的方　，也是全國人民最迫切的需要。</p>
<h3>軍隊須國家化</h3>
<p>第三國家的統一，是近代立國絕對必需的要素，抗戰結束之後，國家統一必因國民全體的協力　誠，而有堅實的保證。我們知道國家國家統一，是民主憲政的惟一基礎，惟有統一的國家，　能牧隊最後勝利的成果，亦惟有統一的國家，　能保障民主制度，發揚民意集中民力，維護主權的獨立，完成建國的大計，以貢獻於國際和平與世界的繁榮。我們要完成國家的統一唯一的前提，就是要我全國軍隊國家化，在我國家領土之內，不再有私人的軍隊，亦不再有任何一黨的軍隊，惟有軍隊不受個人私利，一黨私見的支　，而後國家的統一乃有確實的基礎。</p>
<p>我今日代表政府特別負責聲明，凡受國家編組和　　軍令的軍隊，其待遇必一視同仁，決不有所岐視。而且中國國民黨二十年來之軍隊黨部，今巳完全撤銷，以樹軍隊國家化的先聲，我們希望全國同胞認定軍令政令的統一，爲國家存亡所繫的命脈，共同一致期其實現，加以維護，　　裏忱，爲我國家的前途與人民的福利，作　切的呼籲。</p>
<h3>共肩建國重任</h3>
<p>上述三點，是我們當前最低限度的設施，和最為迫切的要求，只要全國同胞撫循革命的歷史，接受抗戰的教訓，自能領悟破壞之後必須繼之以建設，則破壞時期所受的痛苦犧牲，　算是獲得了寶貴德代價。八年以來，我渝　區同胞或流離轉徒於異鄉，或　連病困於窮途寡婦的遣族尚未撫恤，我後方同胞服兵役者，為國忘家，從事生產者負担　重，言念及此，不勝戰　，所以我們今後的工作，不獨要恢復戰時爲平時，並且要轉化無業爲有業。我們國家的基礎，比聯合國任何一國爲薄弱，我們抗戰的時間，比聯合國任何一國爲久長，我們不獨要再戰火的廢墟之上，　誠團結一德一心，建立現代國家，並且要充實國力，與聯合國共同負起國籍和平世界繁榮的責任。我們　　　痛深得破壞之後，面對着任　　遠的建國大業，深覺工作的　　，　感責任的重大，我誠　希望全國同胞對於上述最低限度的設施，和最爲迫切的要求，要舉國一致積極推進，　於完成。我們過去的工作，是軍事第一，勝利爲先。我們今後的努力，則在國家統一，政治民主。我們只有共循統一與民主的道路完成成建國工作。實行國父的三民主義，　能同　於國力充沛，民生康樂的境域。五十年國民革命所期求，八年抗戰所祈願，就在於這個最大最後的成功。總之，我們必須以和　親陸共濟互助的精神，正視八年來國內殘破創　的現實，而遵國家於復興，更必須以堅毅刻苦自覺自勉的精神，使我中國　於平等自由的現代國家之林，以慰國際友人的期望。我在今天　憶杭戰的初衷，敬悼忠勇的先烈，感謝友邦的援助，懷念人民的痛苦，眞覺得感想無限，特以這個內政方針，普吿於全國國民，切望眞誠坦白，共矢精誠同負責任，以實現我們國家民族迫切的要求，達成我們全國一致奮鬥共同建設的使命。</p>

<h3>國民黨告全國同胞書（二）　盼望一心一德完成建國偉業</h3>
<p>處理內政　方針一貫</p>
<p>即其指導我同胞處理國內問題，亦依然未變。民國十七年時期的方針，所謂「本黨今後能否不辜負革命建國的使命，中國能否依國民革命而獲救，全爲事實問題，且需要長期克苦努力。几　　偏窄務求貫澈一巳的主張，以加重革命環境的困難者，除固執國父遺留的一切教訓，絲毫不能動搖外，其他無不可以調和，無不可以容忍。我們在今日慶祝抗戰勝利之中，當必能深知本黨總裁此種智　和指導，不但爲抗戰勝利所由決定，亦爲建國成功所必依恃。最後國民必賴全國同胞共同努力，方能完全成功，國父遠在同盟會宣言中，巳說明國民革命的意義，在人人宜負革命的責任，政府不過是領導的機關，政府的功績即國民的功績，後在其遺　中，又指示本黨必須喚起民衆共同奮鬥，本黨領導抗戰未敢稍忘遺敎，我同胞亦在八年多的長期抗戰之中，出力出錢，不怨不懈，造成今日的勝利。在首都淪陷以後，本黨要求我同胞集中意志，集中力量，一面抗戰，一面建國，我同胞即在各級民意機關之中，捐　成見，破除畛域，貢獻一切，以利抗建。在國際形勢不利於我之時，本黨要求我同胞更要本着過去自力抗戰的精神，準備迎接最惡劣的局勢，我同胞即恪遵吿誠，不因局勢的險惡而　氣。在不平等條約取消，友邦推誠援助之時，本黨要求我同胞勿　勿　，愈勉愈奮，必須認議惟自強始能獲得眞正之自由，惟自立始能求得眞正之獨立。</p>
<p>犧牲奮　　終獲勝利</p>
<p>我同胞即能自勉自重，不存繳倖依賴之心，避免自　自弛之失，特別是淪陷區域的同胞，雖然朝夕受敵僞的鞭笞燒殺，奸淫擄掠，但常能秘密接受最高統帥的命令，　心服將木黨的主義，　報敵偽的計劃，摧毀敵偽的佈置，其次亦能不爲敵偽屈服，不受敵偽利用，　　牲身家性命於無可抵抗之下，決不稍虧損我民族大節。至於全國數百萬將土及軍民間，無不爲忠勇特著的同胞，無論作戰如何艱苦·給養如何不足，　能接受最高統帥與全國同胞的要求，犧牲一身，轉戰萬里，以劣勢的裝備，抗優勢的大敵至八年之久，卒能獲得今日的戰果。海外僑胞雖遭浩刦，或仍留原地與敵偽奮鬥，或棄業歸國效忠抗戰，凡此難能可貴的志行與成就，實由於我同胞能認議國民革命之意義，能盡忠國民革命的責任，而國父「革命事業由民眾發之，亦由民衆成之」的敎訓，在此次抗戰之中，使之成爲事實。本黨飲水思源，願竭誠對我問胞表示，其中一切力量皆爲我同胞的力量，一切成功皆爲我同胞的成功。（續昨）</p>

<h3>迎杜月笙先生</h3>
<p>杜月笙先生巳於昨日下午自杭蒞滬，各界聞訊紛紛到站歡迎。我們站在上海市民立塲，於此也敬表歡迎之忱。</p>
<p>我們歡迎杜先生，同時，更願期待於杜先生者，約有三點：</p>
<p>第一，杜先生是社會領袖，過去對於上海的地方公益，市民福利，貢獻極多，尤其是行俠仗義，膾炙人口。當滬戰之初，杜先生以上海地方協會會長地位，領導民間致力於抗敵後援工作，增強國軍奮戰禦敵的力量，厥功殊偉。其後國軍西撤，杜先生對於個人在滬的財產與事業，絕不稍顧，毅然離滬，在後方各地繼續努力於抗敵後援工作。這種爲國忘身，捨利取義的志節，實在値得欽佩，而　信實踐，尤其令人感念。</p>
<p>第二，杜先生雖與滬上人士睽隔八年，而滬人都知杜先生在此八年中爲國宣勞的辛勤，因此杜氏重蒞滬土，在市民心目中，聲譽益隆。而上海的社會事業，亟待整頓復興。責任艱鉅，我們深信杜氏必將出其心力，爲地方公益與市民福利作更進一步的貢獻，以　市民渴望。</p>
<p>第三，在今後復興建設的過程中，地方政治淸明的要求，自爲前提條件，尤其在上海，向爲關　國際觀瞻的重要都市，更需要在優良的政治環境中推進　興建設工作。而優良政治的造成，固有賴於賢明的市政長官，但同時，必須有賢明公正的社會領袖爲之輔佐配合，才能收事半功倍相輔相成之效。是則我們期待於杜先生者自將更爲殷切了。</p>
<p>杜先生過去的一切功業，昭然在滬人耳目，我們與其作歌頌之詞，不如率直的貢獻大衆所期待的誠意。同時，我們深信，凡此也必爲進步的社會領袖所樂於接受的。</p>

        <h1>1945.09.04</h1>
<h3>Celebrating Victory, the Whole World Rejoices: Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Address; Announces Domestic Policy Guidelines to Advance Towards National Construction</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 3rd – Chairman Chiang, in his address at the victory celebration ceremony on the 3rd, stated in full:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen! Japan has formally signed the instrument of surrender to our Allied nations, and the world's anti-aggression war has now come to a complete end. Our China's eight years of arduous resistance have, today, finally achieved the ultimate goal of victory. Today is a day of rejoicing for the whole world, and it is also a day for all our countrymen, after enduring hardship and experiencing pain, to celebrate and be encouraged. We offer our respects to the Founding Father of our nation, and console the spirit in heaven of the mentor who founded the Republic of China, and also console the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilian martyrs who generously sacrificed themselves during the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Forever Preserve Glory</h3>
<p>Our national military and civilians, after eight years of unparalleled suffering and sacrifice, have finally reaped the glorious fruit of today. This glorious fruit is something that every compatriot in the country should fully respect and preserve, only to promote and expand it, and never to allow it to be damaged or even lost. Chiang Kai-shek personally feels grateful for the past struggles of the whole country. Considering the current devastation, I feel even more emotional, and I don't know what to say. At this crucial juncture from war to peace, we are working with our allies to end the perilous situation created by Japanese aggression over the past fifty years, and jointly create universal and lasting peace and security in East Asia and the world. We must also, amidst amicable relations with our neighbors and stability within our borders, clean up the aftermath of the war, restore order, provide relief to our compatriots in the recovered areas, console the families of deceased and wounded soldiers and civilians, resettle refugees, and heal suffering.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to make past sacrifices truly worthwhile, it is necessary at this time to create a framework for democratic constitutionalism and consolidate the foundation of national unity. Our fellow countrymen were united in the past to support the War of Resistance and strive for victory, and in the future, we will surely be able to unite to ensure that democracy and unity are both achieved, so that the policies and plans of the Principle of People's Livelihood can be thoroughly implemented in a peaceful and stable social environment.</p>
<p>Therefore, on this day of universal joy and celebration of victory, I would like to present the most important and concrete policies of the National Government regarding domestic affairs to all my fellow countrymen for common planning.</p>
<h3>Reduce the Burden on Farmers and Workers</h3>
<p>First, the purpose of our revolution and resistance is not only to defeat the enemy, but also to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. During these eight years of the War of Resistance, our national military and civilians have endured all kinds of hardships. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, all our fellow countrymen should have the opportunity to recuperate. Our China is a country that is established on agriculture, and the majority of the national population is farmers, followed by workers. The replenishment of troops in our fighting forces is mainly from farmers, and the production of weapons and civilian supplies in the rear is based on workers. During the long years of this War of Resistance, most of the industrial and commercial cities have been devastated, so the replenishment of troops and the burden of national war expenses have largely fallen on the shoulders of farmers. Now, as the War of Resistance comes to a victorious end, farmers who have served in the military and workers who have engaged in production should be allowed to reduce their obligations and burdens as soon as possible. The National Government is mindful of this and has decided to issue a clear order today: national military service will be postponed for one year from today, and the demobilization of soldiers currently in active service in the national army will also be implemented in stages by military and political organs. The National Government has also, in accordance with the program decided by the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, gradually formulated and implemented the method of granting land to soldiers. All provinces that have been occupied by the enemy will be exempted from land taxes for one year this year, and provinces in the rear will also be exempted from land taxes for one year next year. Moreover, the competent authorities and local governments will be instructed to formulate rent reduction methods in accordance with the principle of 25% rent reduction, taking into account local conditions, and submit them to the National Government for approval and implementation before November 12 of this year. We believe that only when farmers and workers have a chance to breathe can society have hope of recovery, and only when rural life has a way to improve can industrial and commercial cities have a foundation for revitalization. Therefore, the National Government must focus on reducing the burdens on farmers and workers and improving their lives as the minimum measure for all fellow countrymen to recuperate. As for other positive aspects, the implementation of the policies and programs of the Principle of People's Livelihood will naturally be regarded by the National Government as the primary task of realizing the Three Principles of the People and will be the government's greatest responsibility in the future.</p>
<h3>Implement Constitutional Government Early</h3>
<p>Second, after the end of the War of Resistance, democratic politics cannot be delayed any longer. The highest ideal of the National Revolution is politics for all the people, and the most important key to realizing this ideal is to return power to the people. The National Assembly is a necessary stage for the National Government to return power to the people, and it is also an important procedure that the National Revolution must complete. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, we expected that victory in the War of Resistance and the implementation of constitutional government would be accomplished in one fell swoop. Now that the War of Resistance has ended victoriously, we believe that the sooner constitutional government is implemented, the better. Therefore, the convening of the National Assembly cannot be delayed any longer. I sincerely hope that all fellow countrymen and representatives from all parties can sincerely and genuinely assist the government in this policy for the sake of the country and the people, and promote the early convening of the National Assembly in order to seek the early completion of democratic politics, which must not be delayed any longer. Because the end of the War of Resistance is precisely the time when the great cause of national construction begins, the government's policy-making will be based on the highest principles, with the utmost sincerity. As long as the highest principle of revolutionary nation-building, the Three Principles of the People, is not shaken, and the legitimacy of the National Government of the Republic of China is not disturbed, all issues can be discussed openly and honestly, seeking reasonable and legal solutions. In particular, I hope that leaders from all sectors of society and from all parties can participate in the government and jointly plan the century-long plan for peaceful nation-building. Before the convening of the National Assembly, the government sincerely wishes to seek opinions widely and comprehensively, so as to avoid any shortcomings. Even the number of representatives to the National Assembly and other related issues can be reasonably increased and legally resolved in accordance with public sentiment.</p>
<h3>Freedom of Speech and Association</h3>
<p>As for the issue of protecting the people's freedom, in addition to the National Government having already earnestly implemented the Law on the Protection of Personal Freedom, it has also decided to abolish the system of press censorship in the near future, so that the people have the freedom of speech, and will formulate and announce the Law on Political Associations, so that the people have the freedom of association, ensuring that all political parties have a common track and a legal status. In this way, people's livelihood politics can follow the examples of Britain and the United States to establish a model of five-power constitution. In short, if we want to realize democratic politics, we must base the administration of punishment on the rule of law and constitutional government as the guarantee of civil rights. The bad habits of the warlord era, in which military force was used to conduct politics and territory was used for self-consolidation, have long since passed and are not what a modern democratic country should have, nor are they permitted in an era of peaceful national construction. All domestic issues must be resolved through political methods, and all opinions must be restored to the track of law as a goal. Only then will the fundamental law jointly sought by our revolutionary martyrs and all fellow countrymen for the past fifty years not repeat the mistakes of the early years of the Republic of China. This is the only policy of our government and the most urgent need of the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Armies Must Be Nationalized</h3>
<p>Third, national unification is an absolutely necessary element for modern nation-building. After the end of the War of Resistance, national unification must be guaranteed by the sincere cooperation of the entire people. We know that national unification is the only basis for democratic constitutional government. Only a unified country can maintain the fruits of the final victory, and only a unified country can guarantee the democratic system, promote public opinion, concentrate people's strength, maintain the independence of sovereignty, complete the great plan of national construction, and contribute to international peace and world prosperity. The only prerequisite for us to achieve national unification is that our national army must be nationalized. Within the territory of our country, there will no longer be private armies, nor will there be armies of any one party. Only when the army is not subject to personal private interests or the prejudice of one party can national unification have a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Today, on behalf of the government, I specifically declare that all armies that are part of the national organization and that obey military orders will be treated equally and will not be discriminated against in any way. Moreover, the KMT party organization within the army, which has been in place for 20 years, has now been completely abolished to set an example for the nationalization of the army. We hope that all fellow countrymen will recognize that the unification of military orders and political orders is the lifeline of the survival of the nation and will work together to realize it, maintain it, and sincerely make an earnest appeal for the future of our country and the welfare of the people.</p>
<h3>Jointly Shoulder the Burden of National Construction</h3>
<p>The above three points are our current minimum facilities and most urgent requirements. As long as fellow countrymen review the history of the revolution and accept the lessons of the War of Resistance, they will be able to understand that construction must follow destruction, and then the pain and sacrifice suffered during the period of destruction will be considered a valuable price paid. For eight years, my fellow countrymen in the Chongqing area have either been displaced in foreign lands or impoverished and sick. The widows and orphans of the deceased have not yet been consoled, and our fellow countrymen in the rear, who have served in the military, have forgotten their families for the country, and those who have engaged in production have shouldered heavy burdens. Thinking of this, I cannot help but tremble with fear. Therefore, our future work is not only to restore wartime to peacetime, but also to transform unemployment into employment. Our country's foundation is weaker than that of any of the Allied countries, and our time of resistance is longer than that of any of the Allied countries. We must not only, on the ruins of war, sincerely unite and build a modern country with one heart and one mind, but also strengthen our national power and jointly assume the responsibility for international peace and world prosperity with the United Nations. Having deeply experienced the pain after destruction, and facing the long-term task of national construction, I deeply feel the arduousness of the work and the weight of the responsibility. I sincerely hope that all fellow countrymen will actively promote the above-mentioned minimum facilities and most urgent requirements with one mind and one heart, in order to complete them. Our past work was military first and victory first. Our future efforts will focus on national unification and political democracy. We can only complete the task of national construction by following the road of unification and democracy. Only by implementing the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father can we jointly enter the realm of abundant national power and people's prosperity and happiness. The aspirations of the fifty years of the National Revolution and the wishes of the eight years of the War of Resistance lie in this greatest and final success. In short, we must face the reality of the country's devastation over the past eight years with a spirit of harmony, kinship, mutual assistance, and mutual aid, and lead the country to recovery. We must also use a spirit of perseverance, hard work, self-awareness, and self-encouragement to make our China stand among the ranks of equal and free modern countries, in order to comfort the expectations of international friends. Today, I recall the original intention of the War of Resistance, pay tribute to the loyal and courageous martyrs, thank the aid of friendly countries, and remember the suffering of the people. I truly feel infinite emotion. I especially announce this domestic policy to the national people, hoping that we will be sincere and frank, and jointly pledge our sincerity and take responsibility to realize the urgent demands of our country and nation, and achieve the mission of common struggle and common construction of our entire nation.</p>

<h3>The Capital Celebrates with a Grand Rally; Chairman Chiang Tours the City; The People Cheer and Their Spirits Are High</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 3rd – The 3rd was the first day of the capital's victory celebration. The whole city was decorated with flags, and the streets and alleys were packed with people, causing traffic to be cut off for six hours. Millions of citizens were intoxicated in this once-in-a-millennium joy. At 9:00 a.m., the capital's various sectors held a victory celebration rally at the school grounds in the central district. The "Voice of Peace" and a hundred salutes were fired at the same time. At 11:20 a.m., Chairman Chiang rode in a car from his official residence to tour the city and receive the citizens' greetings. The Chairman, wearing a grass-green military uniform, a long sword, and gloves, sat in a black-green convertible car with a smiling face, kind and amiable, giving the millions of citizens standing on the side of the road a sense of warmth, and they could not help but cheer for the Chairman. The Chairman also frequently raised his hand in response. Soon, the Chairman went to the Military Affairs Commission to rest for a while. At that time, the square in front of the Military Affairs Commission was already filled with countless citizens waiting for a long time. When they saw the Chairman, they waved small flags, applauded enthusiastically, or shouted "Long live," and their joy and encouragement were beyond description. At 11:54 a.m., the Chairman took the convertible car again from the Military Affairs Commission to tour the city. This was the first time in eight years. Chief of Staff Cheng Dai sat next to the Chairman. The Chairman's car was led by three motorcycles, followed by a jeep with a flag officer holding a large flag that read "Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission." Next came the Chairman's car.

The Chairman's car slowly passed through the Victory Gate, took the school ground entrance, and turned to the People's Rights Road, and turned toward Guo Jie Lou and Lin Shen Road. The streets that the Chairman passed were crowded with people, and traffic was blocked, leaving only a single path for the Chairman's car to pass. The citizens who were close to the Chairman were no more than nine feet away. The impression that the Chairman gave to the citizens was naturally amiable and approachable, and it had never been as deep as it was today. At 12:40 p.m., the Chairman returned to his official residence.</p>

But since personnel from various central government agencies and advance units of the national army have successively arrived in Beijing, legal tender and customs gold units have been circulating in the market. A small number of merchants inevitably discriminated against the legal tender because they were unaware of the situation. Now, after the explanation of various relevant agencies, it is generally accepted. Last month, one yuan of legal tender could buy goods worth one hundred yuan. In recent days, the concept of merchants and the public has changed greatly, and they value the legal tender extremely highly. Therefore, the value of the legal tender is soaring, and each yuan can now buy goods worth two hundred yuan.</p>

<h3>Land Taxes in Occupied Provinces Will Be Exempted This Year; National Government Issued a Clear Order Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd – The National Government's order on September 3rd: For many years, the Japanese warlords have used their violence to exploit China in various ways. After September 18th, they intensified their efforts, including our provinces in the Northeast. By July 7th, they even launched a challenge at Lugou Bridge, and their ambition to annex our country was clearly visible. In order to defend national independence and survival and establish lasting world peace, the National Government had no choice but to lead our entire military and civilians to rise up in resistance to maintain the glory of the nation and uphold international integrity. It has repeatedly declared to China and foreign countries that the time and the situation, although the forms of strength and weakness were vastly different, the justice of right and wrong was clear. Our government followed the teachings of the Founding Father and the revolutionary strategies, adhered to a consistent national policy, and gained the sympathy of the world. Together with our allied nations who uphold justice and love peace, we launched a concerted attack. Since Italy and Germany were defeated one after another, Japan became isolated. Now, its power is exhausted and it has surrendered unconditionally to our Allied nations. The war has ended from this, and the national foundation has been laid. After eight years of enemy atmosphere, it has finally cleared up. It has washed away the national humiliation of fifty years, restored the rivers and mountains of twenty provinces, and liberated the whole country. The whole country is celebrating, and it is difficult to restrain the emotion. Since the beginning of the war, much land has been ravaged, lives have been tragically murdered, and property has been subjected to horizontal losses, even to the point of soldiers going to justice and the people bearing heavy burdens, and the suffering of the people in the occupied areas is painful and sad. Now, I especially issue a clear order that all provinces that have been occupied by the enemy should be exempted from land taxes for one year. Other provinces in the rear, which are relied upon for military food and civilian food this year, will also be allowed to exempt from land taxes next year. The rest of the rent reduction and light interest, as well as all resettlement matters, will be the responsibility of governments at all levels and competent authorities to formulate methods in accordance with the 25% rent reduction and other relevant provisions of the political program and policies related to people's livelihood by November 12 of this year, and implement them in sequence. Our national people are in a time of great difficulty, the beginning of recovery and restoration, and we must remember the lesson of being humiliated, and not neglect the warning of drought. The War of Resistance is difficult to end, and nation-building is just beginning. The task is heavy and the road is long. It is hoped that the whole country will be united in one heart and one mind, and that we will be more diligent and advanced, using the spirit of loyalty, courage, perseverance, and perseverance of the War of Resistance for the sustained and unremitting efforts of nation-building. Then the victory that has been achieved can be guaranteed, and the great cause of restoration can be completed. This is a special announcement, and we must encourage each other.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Held a Remote Sacrifice Yesterday - President Chiang Led the Ceremony</h3>

Next, he pointed out the urgent tasks of domestic affairs. Finally, he explained that the foundation of national reconstruction lies in national unity and political democracy, in order to seek international peace and promote world prosperity. The task is arduous and the road is long, and he hoped everyone would work hard. After the speech, the assembly shouted slogans and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<h3>Open Letter to the Nation from the Kuomintang (Part Two) - Hoping for Unity of Purpose to Complete the Great Task of National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Consistent Policy in Handling Domestic Affairs</p>
<p>That is, the guiding principles for our compatriots in handling domestic issues remain unchanged. The policy during the period of the 17th year of the Republic [1928] was, "Whether or not the Party can live up to the mission of revolution and national construction, and whether China can be saved through the National Revolution, all depend on actual deeds and require long-term, arduous efforts. Any narrow-minded insistence on one's own views that aggravates the difficulties of the revolutionary environment is unacceptable, except for the firm adherence to all the teachings left by the Founding Father, which cannot be shaken in the slightest. Everything else can be reconciled and tolerated." As we celebrate the victory of the War of Resistance today, we must deeply understand that this wisdom and guidance of the Party's President not only determined the victory of the War of Resistance but is also essential for the success of national construction. Ultimately, complete success depends on the joint efforts of all compatriots. As early as in the Alliance Society's declaration, the Founding Father explained the meaning of the National Revolution, that everyone should bear the responsibility of the revolution, and the government is merely the leading agency. The government's achievements are the people's achievements. Later, in his will, he instructed the Party to awaken the masses to fight together. The Party has not dared to forget these teachings while leading the War of Resistance. Our compatriots, too, have contributed money and effort without complaint during the long War of Resistance of over eight years, creating today's victory. After the fall of the capital, the Party asked our compatriots to concentrate their will and strength to resist the war and build the country at the same time. Our compatriots, in various levels of people's representative bodies, discarded prejudices, broke down barriers, and contributed everything to benefit the war and national construction. When the international situation was unfavorable to us, the Party asked our compatriots to uphold the spirit of self-reliance in resisting the war and prepare to face the most adverse circumstances. Our compatriots dutifully followed this advice and did not lose heart due to the perilous situation. When the unequal treaties were abolished and friendly nations offered sincere assistance, the Party urged our compatriots not to be complacent or lax, but to strive even harder, recognizing that only self-strengthening can achieve true freedom, and only self-reliance can achieve true independence.</p>
<p>Sacrificing and Fighting to the End to Achieve Victory</p>
<p>Our compatriots were able to encourage and respect themselves, avoid harboring any thoughts of seeking luck or relying on others, and avoid the mistakes of complacency and relaxation. In particular, the compatriots in the occupied areas, although constantly subjected to the whips, killings, rapes, and plundering by the enemy and puppet regime, were often able to secretly receive orders from the Supreme Commander, sincerely obey the Party's principles, report the enemy and puppet regime's plans, and destroy their arrangements. Furthermore, they were able to resist the enemy and puppet regime's coercion, refuse to be utilized by them, and sacrifice their families and lives under irresistible circumstances, never compromising their national integrity. As for the millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, all were compatriots known for their loyalty and courage. No matter how arduous the fighting or how insufficient the supplies, they were able to accept the demands of the Supreme Commander and the entire nation, sacrifice themselves, and fight across thousands of miles, resisting a superior enemy with inferior equipment for as long as eight years, ultimately achieving today's victory. Overseas Chinese, despite facing great calamities, either remained in their original locations to fight against the enemy and puppet regime, or abandoned their businesses and returned to the country to serve loyally in the War of Resistance. All these rare and valuable aspirations and achievements are due to our compatriots' ability to recognize the meaning of the National Revolution and fulfill their responsibilities in the National Revolution. The Founding Father's teaching that "the revolutionary cause is initiated by the people and also accomplished by the people" has been realized in this War of Resistance. The Party, mindful of its roots, wishes to sincerely express to our compatriots that all the strength comes from our compatriots, and all the success belongs to our compatriots.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Welcoming Mr. Du Yuesheng</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. People from all walks of life gathered at the station to welcome him upon hearing the news. Standing from the perspective of Shanghai citizens, we also express our heartfelt welcome.</p>
<p>We welcome Mr. Du and, at the same time, have three expectations for Mr. Du:</p>
<p>First, Mr. Du is a social leader who has made many contributions to Shanghai's local public welfare and the welfare of its citizens in the past, especially through acts of chivalry and justice that have been widely praised. At the beginning of the Shanghai Battle, Mr. Du, in his capacity as the president of the Shanghai Local Association, led the people in dedicating themselves to supporting the war effort, enhancing the strength of the National Army in fighting against the enemy. His contributions were remarkable. Later, when the National Army withdrew to the west, Mr. Du did not care for his personal property and business in Shanghai and resolutely left Shanghai to continue his efforts in supporting the war in various rear areas. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for the country and taking righteousness over profit is truly admirable, and his trustworthy actions are especially appreciated.</p>
<p>Second, although Mr. Du has been separated from the people of Shanghai for eight years, the people of Shanghai know of Mr. Du's diligence in serving the country during these eight years. Therefore, Mr. Du's return to Shanghai has further enhanced his reputation in the eyes of the citizens. Shanghai's social undertakings are in urgent need of rectification and revitalization. The responsibility is arduous, and we firmly believe that Mr. Du will contribute his efforts and make further contributions to local public welfare and the welfare of the citizens to meet the aspirations of the citizens.</p>
<p>Third, in the process of future revival and construction, the demand for a clean and transparent local government is a prerequisite. Especially in Shanghai, which has always been an important city with international attention, it is even more necessary to promote revitalization and construction in an excellent political environment. The creation of an excellent political environment depends on wise and enlightened municipal officials. At the same time, there must be wise and fair social leaders to assist and cooperate to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, our expectations for Mr. Du will naturally be even more sincere.</p>
<p>All of Mr. Du's past achievements are evident to the people of Shanghai. Rather than offering words of praise, we would rather directly contribute the sincerity that the public expects. At the same time, we firmly believe that all of this will be gladly accepted by progressive social leaders.</p>

However, at this time of laying the foundation for victory, we should provide comfort and encouragement to the families of loyal and courageous martyrs who died for the country to maintain the true meaning of this celebration.
