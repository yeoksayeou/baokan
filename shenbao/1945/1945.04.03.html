<h3>幻夢一般的　舊金山會議</h3>
<p>— 日大使館情報部長岸偉一</p>
<p>克里米亞會談</p>
<p>最近舉行之克里米亞會談，曾聲明反軸心園定於四月二十五日召開舊金山會議。查克里米亞會談，會決定英美蘇三國處分德國方案，並妄以為武力解決即可根本解決德國整個政治社會問題，我們對於此種時代錯誤之措斷，不禁為之一驚，然彼等一錯再錯，莫能自拔，竟又決定四月二十五日爲討論重建世界和平機構之日。</p>
<p>英美兩國，以四月二十五日爲日蘇兩國爲維持遠東和平上佔極重要地位之日蘇中立條約，得以一年之豫吿宣布廢棄之日，乃奇貨可居，遂使蘇聯接受於是日召開會議，由此可知英美兩國意圖及手段之巧妙。蓋彼等擇此日期，一方可使人獲得英美蘇三國關於一般東亞問題，並無何種對立的見解存在之印象；同時使日本國民感到由蘇聯接受於是日舉行會談，推測日蘇中立條約恐難延長，由此謀離間友好的日蘇關係，並利用此種情勢，謀使日本無條件投降，此即爲彼等故意豫先公布會議日期之理由。</p>
<p>又關於此次會議之重要性，則作種種誇大。首先誇稱參加會議國家有四十餘國之多，以示會議範圍之大，吾人旣不記憶其正確數字，更覺無此必要。益多數國家均伴隨戰局之雙邊馬首是瞻者，而所謂島合之衆是也，無論參加國家如何衆多，而由英美蘇宜傳其普遍性，結果把持試會實權者，不過美國而已。</p>
<p>其次爲法國與重慶政權之出席問題，傳特戈爾因未被邀出席克里米亞會談，已拒絕出席該會議，此車常然爲英美一件苦悶之事。所謂以四個自由之開山老祖自任之美國，對於特戈爾之自由發言，已表明有加以干涉之必要，但特戈爾結果或將被迫出席。蓋特戈爾本爲英美私生子，惟如此方能生存，是以迫使法國參加會議，將爲顯示彼等得意之塲面。</p>
<p>至於重慶政權，當即接受克里米亞會談之原則。幷表示欣然參加此次會議之意，由此可知在此次會議討論東亞問題之際，將僅有偏居中國一隅之重慶，更明言之，將僅有英美性格的所有者之重慶參加發表意見，渴望獲得自由最切之其他大多數之大東亞諸國家及諸民族，則被擅於門外。此次會議所討論之議題，雖含有普遍性，但欲對此加以討論之機成份子，實質頗不完畢，從謂此傒根據所謂民主主義原則，但已暴露不足法定人數。又於太平洋之對岸討論確立東亞基礎之東亞固有問題，斷非亞洲十億民族所願聞，不願亞洲十億民族之意　而處理東亞問題，不外為英美制霸世界野心之表現而已。</p>
<p>第三，據謂此次會議謂傒繼承「鄧巴頓奧克斯」會議，從事起草世界和平機稱最後的草案，關於此事容後文再述。</p>
<p>國際聯合之機能與構成</p>
<p>英美蘇三國所組織之世界和平構成績爲「國際聯合」，以總會，安全保障理事會事務局及國際司法裁判所構成之，此係在「鄧巴頓奧克斯一會議所規定，在此等機關中最被重視且最據有權力之最高機關，厭爲安全保陣理事會。</p>
<p>安全保障理事會以五個常務理事國六個非常任理事團構成，五個常任理事國爲美·英·蘇·渝·及最近決定之法國，以代巷過去英法所謂大國在國際聯盟所佔之地位，尤以法國與重慶與英美以所謂平等資格參加會議，其實彼等之性格並未備有其實質。</p>
<p>蓋法國亡命政權之性格，不外爲英美世界觀之一環，法國人民雖衷心期待歐洲大陸之和平與彼等之幸福及繁榮，具有此種本來之要求，但代表彼等之政府則惟有依賴英美之武力，始能繼績存在，此種事實不過使彼等之政府，專爲英美藉維特世界和平之美名，構成最有效之勢力均衡之組織的一個單位，法國旣不許有自己之理想，又不許向英美機構外發展，其存在不過爲於投票表決時，投贊成的一票而已，特戈爾之煩惱即在此。</p>
<p>至於重慶政權，亦被視爲五大國家之一，惟本身問題過多，中國之統一，尙未完成，中國民衆決不能由重慶政權代表，重慶政擊基於其買辦的性格，未能解決中國民衆熱望之中日問題，對於中國之統一與復興，亦未能實現，此事已由中共方面指出，亡命政權與買辦政禮不同之處，一爲放棄國土與人民，依賴英美而謀保全自已政權，一爲僥倖宋離開國土，但已放榮人民，與英美勾結，以謀維持自已政　，重要之煩悶，與特戈爾初無二致，實為良心上苦悶之象徵。</p>
<p>此等國家均未能與英美蘇三國站在同一戰綫，平等討論東亞問題，更談不到爲東亞十億民族之幸福與繫榮而奮爭，蓋彼等之性格與存在之方式，因未容許出此也。</p>
<p>所以安全保障理事會不外由三大固執其牛耳，吾人由親祭三大國所表現之意思，取彼等之思想方向，當能把握所謂安全保障理事會之實體。</p>
<p>安全保障理事會，根據彼等之計動，傒國際聯合之中心的且軸心的機關，該理事會傒討論關於保障戰後國際間安全及維持和平之一切問題，且可以武力為背景予以實施。國際聯合設有總會，總會一如過去之國際聯盟，組成構成員國家之安全體會議，其稱還較國際聯盟為小，不過但任諮詢機關之任務而已。</p>
<p>即在今後之世界何國為侵略者，對於侵略者發動何種武力等最重要問題，專由理事會決定，過去國際聯盟，難然為民主的構成形式，但已呈露英法寡頭支配及維持現狀機構之本實，國際聯合則更強化，此種寡頭支配　，大放厥詞以擁護所謂「民主主義」為惟一旦最高之戰爭目的。彼等在國際聯繫上則不得不陷入認以三頭政治為有效之措置之矛盾中，而此三大國間互相猜疑意見分歧，此即表決手續問題是也。（未完）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>談舊金山會議</h3>
<p>所謂舊金山會戰，業已定於本月二十五日舉行，反軸心各團刻正在積及準備這一天的粉墨登塲，其演出期據美方表示，或將儷續至三個月以上。在開會前夕，敵方的謀略宜傳極爲活躍，因此各方面謠風四起，我們處身其間，實有明辨眞相的必要。</p>
<p>舊金山會議之召集，決定於本年二月四日空十一日的克里米亞會議，根據事後發表的公報而觀，可知這個會議的中心任務，在於完成去年九月及十月間鄧巴頓奧克斯會議未竟的任務，「成立維持和平及安全的全世界國際組織」。</p>
<p>然而，這僅是片面的幻想。實際，在國際戰爭正在進行之際，地球上尙有十數億人民未有代表派赴該會之前，試問該會憑什麽來討論成立維持和平及安全的「全」世界國際組織呢？即使討論而有結論，能發生什麼效力呢？但是，英美蘇各國並非全不了解這些問題，而竟鄭重其事的準備這次會議，又是爲些什麼呢？很顯然的，英美之所以擴大宣傳舊金山會議將「成立維持和平及安全的全世界國際組織」，真正的用心所在，還只是配合著戰爭目的的一種謀略表現而已。例如：</p>
<p>第一，目前戰爭臨於決戰階段，是雙方一切力量的總決鬥，敵美利用這次會議，利用參加這次「決定成立維持和平及安全的全世界國際組織」的出席權，一面企圖誘引一些徬徨反軸心陣營外面的國家，以加强自已的聲勢，一面企業威脅這些國家脫離軸心陣營而削弱對方的聲勢。</p>
<p>第二，宣傳舊金山會議將如何決定未來世界秩序與命運的重要性，並且決定在最短促期內舉行，這裏一方面充分暴露出敵方對現在戰局利用久戰而疲勞的各國人民求和的心理，以謀在軸心國親軸心國及中立國之間，浩成一種投機取巧的結束戰爭運動，因而削弱軸心國的阻力作戰。</p>
<p>第三，如日本大使館岸情報部長在「幻夢一般的舊金山會議」一文（見今日本報）中所指出，舊金山會議開幕日期適爲日蘇中立絛約預告繼績與否的同一日期，（日蘇中立條約成立於一九四一年四月二十五日，有效期爲五年，規定如需續約，須在一年以前通知）這裏又包含着英美巧妙挑撥日蘇國交及散播國際政治謠諑的陰謀。</p>
<p>明白了敵美英這種用心所在，就可以了解這次舊金山會議的「眞價値」了，同時，英美渝各方正在興高采烈之際，而主要發起人之一的蘇聯，只派出由駐美大使率領的一批在國際間無藉藉名的代表團，這種冷漠的表現，也可以佐證我們上面對於這次會議的估價了。</p>
<p>所以，我們對於舊金山食議，決不能有更高乎上述的估價。我們站在參戰中國的立塲，尤當本政府旣定國策，與盟邦密切協力，向完隨戰爭之路邁步。我們唯有堅定信念，使敵人陰謀無法實現，那麼，舊金山會議不會議，出席些什麼人物，討論些什麼間題，都可視之爲敵美在太平洋東岸搬演的一幕空想劇，對於現實的國際問題，絕對起不了什麼作用。</p>

<h3>菲島獨立　尙非其時　美內長之言論</h3>
<p>中央社訊　美內長易克斯，三月二十六日夜宣稱：「美國疑對菲律賓給與其所需要之物，但目下立即使菲律賓獨立，爲有弊無利之舉」云云。據此間菲律賓僑民意見，易克斯之聲明，完全將美國帝國主義的野心暴露無疑，　第一次大戰時，英國對於印度之非法行為，足以表示盎格魯撒克遜對東亞之殖民地政策，中國朝野亦時常論及，英·美自此次戰爭開始以來，監於上次大戰時手段之失敗，乃改變作風，標榜「擁護民主主義」，「防止侵略主義」，用以防止弱小國家的難間，即對於薰變，亦不外此項手段而已。例如在前年英·美的約定將來撤廣志脫離戰爭。易克斯藉口「菲律賓之經濟，人民及政府，受到戰爭的重大打擊」，而認為獨立時期尚早，則其約定薰變撤廢治外權，亦可設：「薰變之經濟，人民及政府受到戰爭的重大打擊」，不知何年何月可以付諸實現。據舊金山會議，美國國內不止易克斯一人作如此論調，即前任菲律賓高等檢察官麥克納亦論述如此，由是觀之，菲島獨立時期尙早的意見，在美國極為普遍。美國的手段與上次大戰時英國對付印度之手段，如出一轍，使菲人極慨表憤。</p>

<h3>生產與敎育　蘇省府兩施政重心　任援道省長談話</h3>
<p>— 毅湯</p>
<p>記者說：「聽得過去蘇州城廂有查封食米的事，現在想已圓滿解決了。」</p>
<p>「外面知道道事嗎？」任省長詫異地問：「查封住戶食米的時候，恰巧我難開蘇州，回來知道此事，便停止進行。」</p>
<p>記者說：「民衆方面對於這件事當然非常感激。」</p>
<p>「這種臨時發生的事，不是省府的主要工作。省府目前施政的重心有兩點，就是生產與敎育。生產與敎育，才眞是國家百年的大計。」任省長說到這裏，站了起來，用手比着說：「第一，目前需要增加生產，理由毋需說明，我們已從各方面計劃和推動；這次被疏散的上海市民，大多數是有工作能力的，因此盼望他們到江蘇省來興辦小工廠或手工業，江蘇省的繁榮與建設，期望於他們者正多。第二，敎育程度的提高，現在正以全力從事。目前敎育程度之低落，學風的浮囂，學生體格的衰弱，是不可諱言的事宜。</p>
<p>「這次事變的發生，原因固然複雜，但當時學生浮燥囂張，也不無影響，譬如坐船的人全部叫著那樣，喊著這樣，迫得把鴕者失了主意，眼看着向礁石駛去。當時的執政者又何嘗打算開戰？……宣戰媾和，是政府領袖的事，民衆應將抉擇的重任，放在政府領袖的肩上，如果各有各的主張，把舵的把不穩舵，一下觸了礁，造成了多麼悲慘的事態，這眞是可以惋惜的事。</p>
<p>「所以過去有人嚷，求學不忘救國，我却反過來說，救國不忘求學，求學就是救國，求學的時期，尤其是中學生，又無妨暫時忘了救國。我會不止一遍向此地的學生指出這一點。</p>
<p>「所以省府要提高的，不僅智育。我們要造成穩重鎭定活潑的學風，活潑不是輕浮，穩重鎭定的活潑才是眞的活潑。我們正計劃提倡步行和勞作等課餘活動，以增强學生體格，沒有健全的體格，不耍說救國，連自已也救不了。國家的復興，祇有從最根本的敎育做起。</p>
<p>「根據這個原則，所以全省敎育人員的待遇，已提高至公務員一樣了；凡有徽用學校校舍的事，我總極力交涉，設法避免。」</p>
<p>量後，任省長揮霍拳，鄭重地說：「我們決心在這方面盡最大的努力，明知效果一定很微薄，但不能爲了微薄便不做，表面上看來微薄的效果，對於將來的影響却很大。」</p>

Today, ground and air forces are launching a fierce attack. The Japanese Army Special Attack Air Unit also launched a fierce attack against the American landing forces at sea off Okinawa Island from the night of the 31st to dawn on the 1st. The confirmed results so far include the burning of one medium-sized transport ship, as well as the sighting of two columns of black smoke and two large columns of fire.

As of 7:00 PM on April 1st, 550 enemy soldiers were killed, 18 tanks were immobilized, 18 landing boats were destroyed, two enemy planes were shot down, and three were destroyed. The total enemy losses have reached over 2,100. Furthermore, American forces attempting to land near Minatogawa on the southern part of the island were forced to retreat from the coast to a point 10,000 meters south of the coast due to the fierce attack by Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Special Attack Unit Raids Enemy Fleet; Achieves Great Results in the Kerama Sea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – At around 4:00 AM on the 26th, a Japanese Army Special Attack Unit penetrated the enemy escort aircraft carrier in the waters off the Kerama Islands. Although the results were not immediately clear, reports from directly escorting aircraft returning confirmed the sinking of one large aircraft carrier seemingly converted from a cruiser, as well as the sinking and destruction of several large and medium-sized aircraft carriers and battleships. Further investigation revealed that between the night of the 28th and the 31st, the Army Special Attack Unit achieved the following results: At 1:45 AM on the 29th, one ship of unknown type was severely damaged off the coast of Okinawa Island. By 2:00 AM, two columns of fire were seen in that direction. At 3:56 AM, two columns of fire were seen in the direction of Nakagusuku Bay on the island. At 2:47 AM on the 30th, one ship of unknown type was sunk near the southern end of the Kerama Islands, with one column of fire and one large explosion heard. At the same time, two Japanese Army Special Attack planes set ablaze one ship of unknown type in the Kerama Islands area. That morning, in the waters north of the Kerama Islands, a total of thirteen columns of fire were observed between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM. To the south of Kerama, five fires were counted between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM. Furthermore, in the waters off Minatogawa on the south side of Okinawa Island, two columns of fire were observed at 3:00 AM, and one at 5:00 AM, for a total of three columns. In total, twenty-one columns of fire could be seen from the land, and bombing sounds were heard. However, due to the heavy fog in the area at the time, the results could not be confirmed. On the 31st, one transport ship was severely damaged and burned. At around 3:00 PM, two enemy ships of unknown type were seen being rammed and set ablaze by the Japanese Special Attack Unit and subsequently sank.</p>
<p>List of Commanders of American and British Units</p>

<h3>The Phantasmagorical San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>—Kishi Iichi, Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>The Crimean Conference</p>
<p>The recently held Crimean Conference declared that the anti-Axis powers would convene the San Francisco Conference on April 25th. The Crimean Conference decided on a plan by the UK, US, and Soviet Union to dispose of Germany, presumptuously believing that a military solution could fundamentally resolve Germany's entire political and social problems. We are taken aback by this anachronistic decision. Yet, they continue to err without extracting themselves, deciding that April 25th would be the day to discuss the reconstruction of a world peace organization.</p>
<p>The UK and US have chosen April 25th, the date on which the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, a treaty of extreme importance in maintaining peace in the Far East, could be declared for abrogation with one year's notice, as a rare opportunity. They persuaded the Soviet Union to accept convening the conference on that day, which reveals the ingenuity of the UK and US in their intentions and means. By choosing this date, they could create the impression that the UK, US, and Soviet Union had no conflicting views on general East Asian issues. At the same time, they could make the Japanese people feel that the Soviet Union's acceptance of holding talks on this day meant that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact would probably not be extended. They would thus seek to sow discord between the friendly Japanese and Soviet relations, and use this situation to seek Japan's unconditional surrender. This is why they deliberately announced the date of the conference in advance.</p>
<p>They have also exaggerated the importance of the conference in various ways. First, they have exaggerated the number of participating countries to be over forty, to show the large scope of the conference. We do not remember the exact number, nor do we feel it is necessary. Most of the countries are merely following the lead of the sides in the war, just a motley crowd. No matter how many countries participate, the UK, US, and Soviet Union promote its universality, but the real power to control the conference lies with the United States alone.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of France and the Chongqing regime's attendance. It is rumored that Torgol has refused to attend the conference because he was not invited to the Crimean Conference, which is a matter of distress for the UK and US. The United States, which claims to be the father of the Four Freedoms, has indicated the need to interfere with Torgol's freedom of speech, but Torgol will eventually be forced to attend. Torgol is, after all, a bastard of the UK and US, and can only survive in this way. Forcing France to participate in the conference will show off their triumphant scene.</p>
<p>As for the Chongqing regime, it immediately accepted the principles of the Crimean Conference and expressed its willingness to participate in the conference. This shows that when East Asian issues are discussed at this conference, only Chongqing, which is isolated in one corner of China, will participate. To put it more clearly, only Chongqing, which has the characteristics of the UK and US, will participate and express its opinions. Most of the other East Asian countries and peoples, who are most eager to obtain freedom, are excluded from the door. Although the issues discussed at this conference have universality, the ingredients that constitute the participants are not complete. It is said that this is based on the so-called principles of democracy, but it has exposed the lack of a quorum. Furthermore, discussing the inherent problems of East Asia, which establishes the foundation of East Asia, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean is not what the billion people of Asia want to hear. Handling East Asian issues without the will of the billion people of Asia is nothing more than the expression of the UK and US's ambition to dominate the world.</p>
<p>Third, it is said that this conference will inherit the "Dumbarton Oaks" conference and engage in drafting the final draft of the world peace organization. More on this later.</p>
<p>The Function and Composition of the United Nations</p>
<p>The world peace organization organized by the UK, US, and Soviet Union is called the "United Nations," and consists of the General Assembly, the Security Council Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice. This was stipulated at the "Dumbarton Oaks I Conference." Among these institutions, the most important and most powerful highest organ is the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Security Council consists of five permanent member states and six non-permanent member states. The five permanent member states are the US, UK, Soviet Union, Chongqing, and the recently decided France. This replaces the position that the so-called major powers of the past, the UK and France, occupied in the League of Nations. In particular, France and Chongqing participate in the conference with the UK and US as so-called equal qualifications, but their characters do not possess the substance.</p>
<p>The character of the French government in exile is nothing more than a part of the UK and US worldview. Although the French people sincerely expect peace and their happiness and prosperity in the European continent, they have this inherent requirement. However, the government representing them can only continue to exist by relying on the military force of the UK and US. This fact only makes their government a unit that constitutes the most effective balance of power in the organization for the UK and US to maintain world peace in name. France is not allowed to have its own ideals, nor is it allowed to develop outside the UK and US institutions. Its existence is only for casting a vote in favor at the time of voting. Torgol's troubles lie in this.</p>
<p>As for the Chongqing regime, it is also regarded as one of the five major countries. However, it has too many problems of its own. The unification of China has not been completed. The Chinese people can never be represented by the Chongqing regime. The Chongqing regime, based on its comprador character, has failed to solve the Sino-Japanese problem that the Chinese people are eager for. It has also failed to realize the unification and revival of China. This has been pointed out by the Communist Party of China. The difference between a government in exile and a comprador government is that one abandons the country and the people and relies on the UK and US to preserve its own regime, and the other happens to leave the country, but has abandoned the people and colludes with the UK and US to maintain its own regime. The important boredom is no different from Torgol's, and is a symbol of a conscience tormented.</p>
<p>These countries have failed to stand on the same front as the UK, US, and Soviet Union to equally discuss East Asian issues, let alone strive for the happiness and prosperity of the billion people of East Asia, because their characters and ways of existence do not allow them to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Security Council is nothing more than the three powers tenaciously holding the reins of power. By observing the intentions expressed by the three great powers and taking their direction of thought, we can grasp the essence of the so-called Security Council.</p>
<p>According to their plan, the Security Council will be the central and pivotal organ of the United Nations. The Council will discuss all issues concerning guaranteeing international security and maintaining peace after the war, and can implement it with military force as a background. The United Nations has a General Assembly. The General Assembly, like the League of Nations in the past, is composed of a security meeting of constituent member states. Its title is even smaller than that of the League of Nations, but it only assumes the task of a consultation agency.</p>
<p>That is, in the future world, which country is the aggressor, and what kind of military force will be launched against the aggressor are the most important issues, and are determined by the Council. In the past, the League of Nations, although with a democratic composition, had already revealed the essence of oligarchic domination by the UK and France and the maintenance of the status quo. The United Nations has further strengthened this oligarchic domination, loudly declaiming the so-called "democracy" as the only supreme war aim. In international relations, they have to fall into the contradiction of recognizing the tripartite system as an effective measure, and this is also the problem of mutual suspicion and disagreement between the three major countries, which is the problem of voting procedures. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Talking About the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>The so-called San Francisco Conference has been scheduled to be held on the 25th of this month. The anti-Axis groups are now actively preparing for this day's grand debut. According to the US, the performance period may last for more than three months. On the eve of the conference, the enemy's propaganda and schemes are extremely active, so it is necessary for us to be in the midst of it and discern the truth.</p>
<p>The convocation of the San Francisco Conference was decided at the Crimean Conference from February 4th to 11th of this year. According to the communique issued afterwards, the central task of this conference was to complete the unfinished tasks of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in September and October of last year, and to "establish a worldwide international organization for maintaining peace and security."</p>
<p>However, this is just a one-sided fantasy. In reality, when an international war is in progress, and when more than a billion people on Earth have no representatives sent to the conference, may we ask what the conference relies on to discuss the establishment of a "worldwide" international organization for maintaining peace and security? Even if there is a discussion and a conclusion, what effect can it have? However, the UK, US, and Soviet Union are not entirely unaware of these issues, yet they are solemnly preparing for this conference. What is the reason for this? It is very obvious that the reason why the UK and US are expanding their propaganda about the San Francisco Conference "establishing a worldwide international organization for maintaining peace and security" is that their real intention is just a strategic expression coordinated with the war aims. For example:</p>
<p>First, the current war is at the stage of decisive battle, which is the total decisive battle of all forces on both sides. The enemy US is using this conference, using the right to attend this "decision to establish a worldwide international organization for maintaining peace and security," on the one hand, to try to lure some countries outside the wavering anti-Axis camp to strengthen their own momentum, and on the other hand, to threaten these countries to break away from the Axis camp and weaken the other side's momentum.</p>
<p>Second, they are promoting the importance of how the San Francisco Conference will decide the future world order and destiny, and they have decided to hold it in the shortest possible period. This fully exposes the enemy's psychology of seeking peace among the people of various countries who are tired of the current war, in order to create a speculative movement to end the war among the Axis countries, pro-Axis countries, and neutral countries, thereby weakening the resistance of the Axis countries.</p>
<p>Third, as the Japanese Embassy's Information Minister Kishi pointed out in his article "The Phantasmagorical San Francisco Conference" (see today's newspaper), the opening date of the San Francisco Conference coincides with the same date on which the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty is notified to continue or not (the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty was established on April 25, 1941, with a validity period of five years, stipulating that if a renewal is required, notice must be given one year in advance). This again contains the UK and US's clever instigation of Soviet-Japanese relations and dissemination of international political rumors.</p>
<p>Understanding the enemy's US-UK's intentions allows us to understand the "true value" of the San Francisco Conference. At the same time, while the US-UK-Chongqing parties are cheering with excitement, the Soviet Union, one of the main initiators, is only sending a delegation led by the ambassador to the US, a group of people who are unknown in the international community. This indifferent performance can also corroborate our above assessment of this conference.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not have a higher evaluation of the San Francisco Conference than the above. Standing in the position of participating in the war in China, we must follow the established national policy of the government, closely cooperate with the allied countries, and move towards the road of completing the war. We can only strengthen our belief and make the enemy's conspiracy impossible to achieve. Then, whether the San Francisco Conference is held or not, who attends, and what issues are discussed, can all be regarded as a fantastic play staged by the US on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean, which will absolutely not play any role in realistic international issues.</p>

<h3>Philippine Independence Not Yet the Time: US Secretary of the Interior's Remarks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - US Secretary of the Interior Ickes declared on the night of March 26: "The United States doubts that it can give the Philippines what it needs, but making the Philippines independent immediately would do more harm than good." According to the opinions of the Filipino expatriates here, Ickes' statement completely exposed the imperialistic ambitions of the United States. The illegal actions of Britain towards India during the First World War are sufficient to show the Anglo-Saxon colonial policy towards East Asia. The Chinese government and public also often discuss this. Since the beginning of this war, Britain and the United States, in view of the failure of the methods used during the last World War, have changed their style and proclaimed "supporting democracy" and "preventing aggression" to prevent the difficulties of small and weak countries. Even for the abolished extraterritoriality, it is nothing more than this method. For example, in the agreement between Britain and the United States in the previous year, the abolition of extraterritoriality would be withdrawn from the war. Ickes used the excuse that "the economy, people and government of the Philippines have suffered a major blow from the war" and believed that the time for independence was too early. Then, one can also say about the agreement to abolish extraterritoriality: "The economy, people and government of extraterritoriality have suffered a major blow from the war." It is not known when it can be realized. According to the San Francisco Conference, Ickes is not the only one in the United States who makes such remarks. The former Philippine High Prosecutor, McNutt, also made such remarks. From this point of view, the opinion that the time for Philippine independence is still early is very common in the United States. The means of the United States are exactly the same as the means used by Britain to deal with India during the last World War, which makes the Filipinos express their anger.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Enemy Air Raid on Shanghai; Four Aircraft Crashed; Strafing Civilians Killed and Injured More Than a Dozen People</h3>
<p>Yesterday (2nd) morning, about 20 P-51 enemy aircraft came to Shanghai twice. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, four were shot down and four were destroyed. The enemy aircraft did nothing and flew away. The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Press Department issued the following statement on the same day:</p>
<p>At about 10:20 on April 2nd for about 20 minutes, more than a dozen enemy P-51 fighters invaded the Shanghai area. The Japanese army's interception unit shot down four of them and severely damaged four others, driving them back. Our side suffered extremely minor damage.</p>
<p>At 11:20, five P-51s approached the Shanghai area and also left without taking any action.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Strafe Innocent Civilians</p>
<p>The enemy troops who raided the area in the morning descended to a low altitude of 20 meters above the ground and fired at 〇〇, but hardly damaged the book. One of the teams in the southwest of Shanghai actually strafed the houses of Chenjiaqiao Town and Panjialang, killing and injuring a dozen Chinese people. At that time, the enemy aircraft were only 15 meters above the ground. When the old and young residents fled hand in hand, the enemy clearly knew that they were Chinese civilians who were not combatants, but still strafed them. Their inhumane behavior was outrageous. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, one of them was hit and dropped the windshield glass and auxiliary twisted oil cans in order to get away, but it finally crashed on the bank of the Suzhou River. The nearby people witnessed this scene and applauded happily. Three other aircraft were also shot down, four were destroyed, and the rest fled in panic.</p>

<h3>Revised Advertising Donation Rate</h3>
<p>The advertising donation rate and penalties for illegal advertisements set by the Municipal Construction Bureau in the past have been in effect for a long time and have long been outdated. Therefore, they have been revised and submitted to the municipal government for approval, which will take effect from today. All advertising donation rates and penalties for illegal advertisements in this city will be charged ten times the previous rate.

<h3>Central Reserve Bank Handles Short-Term Lending to the Money Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank originally excluded the money industry from handling short-term lending to financial institutions. The members of the money industry believed that the Central Reserve's short-term lending was necessary for the adjustment of the industry's business, so they separately asked the relevant association to negotiate with the Central Reserve Bank. On the one hand, the association actively prepared for the preparation and storage of evidence, as a substitute for deposit preparation. It is now reported that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office has replied to the industry association regarding the Central Reserve Bank's handling of short-term lending to the money industry, approving its request. The association has also specifically asked the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank to approve the change of the provision in Article 1, Section 2 of the short-term lending regulations that excludes the money industry.</p>

<h3>Production and Education: Two Priorities of Jiangsu Provincial Government: Interview with Governor Ren Yuandao</h3>
<p>— Yi Tang</p>
<p>The reporter said: "I heard that there was a sealing of food rice in the suburban areas of Suzhou in the past, and now I think it has been resolved satisfactorily."</p>
<p>"Does the outside world know about this matter?" Governor Ren asked in surprise: "When the residents' rice was sealed, it happened that I was about to leave Suzhou. When I came back and learned about this matter, I stopped it."</p>
<p>The reporter said: "The public is certainly very grateful for this matter."</p>
<p>"These kinds of temporary events are not the main work of the provincial government. The current priorities of the provincial government are two points, which are production and education. Production and education are truly the great plans for the nation's centuries to come." Governor Ren said here, stood up, and gestured with his hand, saying: "First, there is currently a need to increase production, and the reasons need not be explained. We have already planned and promoted it from all aspects. Most of the Shanghai citizens who were evacuated this time have working abilities. Therefore, we hope that they will come to Jiangsu Province to set up small factories or handicrafts. The prosperity and construction of Jiangsu Province is expected to be greatly influenced by them. Second, the improvement of the level of education is now being pursued with all our strength. The low level of education, the frivolous academic atmosphere, and the weakening of students' physical condition are undeniable facts.</p>
<p>"The occurrence of this incident was certainly complex, but the students' frivolous and boisterous behavior at the time also had an impact. For example, people on the boat were all shouting this and that, forcing the helmsman to lose his mind and watch the boat sail towards the reef. Did the rulers at the time intend to go to war? … Declaring war and making peace are matters for the government leaders. The public should place the important task of decision-making on the shoulders of the government leaders. If everyone has their own ideas, the helmsman will not be able to steer the boat steadily, and it will hit the reef, causing such a tragic situation. This is truly a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>"Therefore, in the past, someone shouted, 'Study without forgetting to save the country,' but I say the opposite, 'Save the country without forgetting to study.' Studying is saving the country. During the period of studying, especially middle school students, it doesn't hurt to temporarily forget about saving the country. I have pointed this out to the students here more than once.</p>
<p>"Therefore, what the provincial government wants to improve is not only intellectual education. We want to create a steady, calm, and lively academic atmosphere. Lively is not frivolous; steady, calm, and lively is true liveliness. We are planning to promote extracurricular activities such as walking and labor to enhance students' physical fitness. Without a sound body, let alone saving the country, you can't even save yourself. The revival of the country can only start with the most fundamental education.</p>
<p>"Based on this principle, the treatment of educational personnel throughout the province has been raised to the same level as civil servants. Whenever there are matters involving school buildings, I always try my best to negotiate and find ways to avoid them."</p>
<p>Finally, Governor Ren waved his fist and said solemnly: "We are determined to do our best in this regard. We know that the effect will certainly be very meager, but we cannot not do it because it is meager. The seemingly meager effect will have a great impact on the future."</p>
