<h3>蔣主席廣播演說　八處奮斗勝利念今日已實現　永久和平基於人類互相薄愛</h3>
<p>十七日巾央社訊　據重慶廣播：蔣主席於十五日上午十時，會向全世界及全中國人士，舉行廣播，原詞節錄如次。</p>
<p>全國軍民同胞們：全世界愛好和平的人士們：</p>
<p>我們的正義戰勝了強權，終於得到了事實的證明，這事實亦為我們國民革命歷史的成功。我中國於黑暗中八年奮鬥的信念，今始得實現。對出現於面前的和平，我們耍感謝我全國抗戰以來犧牲的軍民，要感謝為正義和平共同作戰的盟友尤須感謝國父艱苦領導我們革命政策之途徑，使我們有今日勝利成功的一天全世界之基督教徒，亦應感謝仁慈全能的上帝。</p>
<p>我全國同胞，自抗戰以來，八年間的痛苦，雖一日日的在加深，可是抗戰的信念，亦日益增強，油漆是我們淪陷區的同胞們，受盡了無窮的摧殘壓迫，尤倍嘗了艱苦，而終於今天，是得到了完全的解放，重見天日了。這幾年來，各地軍民歡呼與快樂的情緒，實掩沒了過去的悲哀，其主要意義亦為佔領區的同胞們得到了解放。</p>
<p>現在抗戰已是勝利了，然而這尙非最後的勝利，要知道戰爭的含義，絕非在世界上又打了一次勝仗，而尤共是這次勝利之力，乃為世界之公力。</p>
<p>我相信全世界的人類，與全中國的同胞，一定一致的希望着這次戰爭，是世界文明國家所參加作戰的最後一次戰爭，如果這果為最後一次戰爭的話，那衣我們同胞們，雖受了無可形容的慘酷的痛苦，然而我們這項的收穫是可以滿足的了。</p>
<p>中國國民處於最黑暗的時代，能以一貫之仁愛與傳統精神，不斷努力，深知為正義與人道之機牲，必能獲得應得之報償。</p>
<p>全世界因戰爭而聯合的民族，相五之間，發生的互相協力與尊重，此即為這次戰爭之代價。</p>
<p>我聯合國以靑年血肉築成之反侵略長城，不只為臨時之結合，而為人類共同之信仰，一種永遠的組合，此為聯合國勝利之基礎，決非為敵任何陰謀所能破壞。</p>
<p>深信今後無分地域，無分種色，人類之同，必能加深聯合，而如手足，這次戰爭，發揚了人類互遵互助的信仰與關係，更證明世界戰爭與和平是不可分開的，這也足可為今後戰爭不再致發生的力證。</p>
<p>這裏我想到了基督實訓上所說待人如已」，和「要愛敵人」的話，實在有無限的感想。</p>
<p>我們要知道，與人為善，是我們傳統的精神，我們曾一貫的聲明，我們只以日本軍閥為敵，決不以日本百姓為敵，理在日本軍閥，已經被打倒了，我們當然要責成其忠誠的執行投降的條件，然而我們決不可企圖對日本人作污辱，應對他們以及他們在納粹軍閥所壓迫凌侮下的百姓，表示憐憫，促使他們能自拔於罪惡。</p>
<p>須知以暴行答復過去的暴行，則冤冤相報，永無終止的一天，那有失仁義之師的本義了，這是現在我們每一個軍民所應該特別注意的。</p>
<p>同胞們，現在侵略主義已為擊敗，但是我們尚未達到眞實的目的，須澈底的消減其侵略背景及潛力。</p>
<p>更要知道，勝利的報償，決不是繑侈與怠　。</p>
<p>要知道戰爭中止以後的工作，正須要我們以更大的努力，去負責改革和建造。</p>
<p>或於某一時期，將使我們感到校戰時尤為艱苦困難的現實，這種現實，隨時隨地皆可能臨於我們的頭上。</p>
<p>將來比校艱因的工作，就是一般曾受純粹領導的××工作者，我們將如何使其了解共本身之錯誤，而接受三民主義，理解强權與正義之孰為合理，這是我們中國與盟國今後須要努力的一項工作。</p>
<p>確信世界之永久和平，是建築於入類民主互助與博愛精神之上的，我們應向這一目標邁進，</p>
<p>人請全盟邦人士及國人，都相信武力獲得之和平，是並非永久的和平，永久和平之實現，須要我們在理性的戰塲上去征服敵人，使他們痛切的懺悔而歸為和平信徒，則始達永久之</p>

<p>本市昨日起停止防空工作　解除防空命令及燈火管制　　上海特別市市民防空本部發第二十六號佈告雲：“㈠八月十七日下午四時起，停止本特別市之防空業務。㈡八月十七日下午四時起，廢止本特別市施行之民防空關係各項規定。”　　又本市日陸海軍防空司令部發三十二號佈告雲：“八月十七日下午四時起，解除防空命令及燈火管制。”戶口麵粉昨起普遍配售　每人一市觔售二千五百元　　本市本期戶口粉，業經粉麥編制委員會上海區粉　統配處將應配一部份麵粉，撥發各零配米號，由市經濟局督飭自昨（十七）日起普遍配售，每人一市觔，價爲二千五百元。惟因尚有一部份粉未能運到，故有一部份零售米店米會領到配粉，須俟二三日後，即可運到配售。據悉粉麥編制機關在民食未充分解決前，當繼續維持戶口粉配給。證券交易所停止交易　　連日華股價格　跌，交易清淡，華商證券交易所昨特通告自即日（十八日）起，停止交易。　　華股慘跌原因　　邇來華股價格一再慘跌，已入無人問津之境，據悉華股一再下挫，約有如下之原因：㈠大戶持有者，已作爲投資之目標，新進　口已告停止。㈡投機者以股票押款輾轉購進，中途忽遭行莊停止放款，忍痛斬出，歸償舊欠，形成供過於求。㈢人心冷淡，一致觀望，多空頭已遭迎頭打擊。㈣行莊停止透支，付款票據大率退票，經紀人因受交劃手續限制，應付款項已代客戶付出，價格每況愈下，造成經紀人自己　進。㈤散戶情結慌張，多頭紛紛求售。五期金證券今起兌現　　中央儲備銀行發行之第五期金證券，於七月廿九日改變辦法，委託證券市場經紀人照市出售後，是項金證券原定九月卅日兌付黃金，茲因局勢轉變，爲昭示信用起見，決定自今（十八）日提前兌付黃金，凡持有五期金證券者可於今日向外灘廿三號該行憑券兌取資金，尾數額以每兩七百萬元作價付款。　　金券市場昨仍開市　　昨日金證券市場照常開市，唯以市勢不振，仍未做開，並無正式市價，交易毫無，據該市場方面消息，該市場爲維護業務，每日仍循例開市。各行莊結束信託業務　　本市銀錢業，現爲慎重業務之運營，對於各項貸放已暫行停辦，所有以前貸出之資金，無論其已否到期，均積極催辦了結手續。又悉各銀行之信託業務，因目前實難以繼續辦理，決定予以結束，待將來需要時再行恢複。國民論壇小學教師之責任  張成鋆　　今之　身小學教師者，往往視　講席爲長途，而憚於教人，嗚呼！此我國學術之所以迄無進步也。夫教育爲國家之命脈，故身負教育之責者，即當視教育爲終身職務，昔孟子以得天下英才而教育爲三樂之一，誠以勤以　人，即所以忠爲謀國也。由此觀之，身任教育之責者之任務，豈不大哉！惟所有任務乃不外下列各點：　　㈠教化兒童　　教師之教化兒童，　農人之耕耘田畝也，　人之耕耘田畝，必勤加培　，慎爲保護，則　庶有豐收之望，教師之教育兒兒童，亦必勤加指導，慎爲誘　，則兒童方有進步可觀，雖兒童之賦性有智愚之別，尤當如樹藝之察其物性，辦其土宜，或以深耕，或以淺植，或以濃　，或以淡沃，而徇徇善誘，潛移默化，以底於成。　　㈡應具有研究精神　　夫以孔子之誨人不倦，尚必先之以學而不厭，誠以學問之道，浩如煙海，且世界日新，則文明日進，苟無精勤之研究，安有深切之明　，故凡爲教師，必須具有研究之精神。但餘所謂研究者，非徒向書籍報　上求之也，語雲：“　善爲　”，又雲：“他山之石，可以攻錯”，故雖言研究，尤須於師友方面互相切磋，互相討論，則成見自除，　理始見矣。　　㈢教師應以身作則　　昔孔子之所以得成爲萬世表者，以其行而世爲天下則，言而世爲天下法，故能得門弟子之中心悅服也。由此觀之，人格感化，爲教師者實當注意也，美國斐利伯亦云：“教師無論說任何的話都要留意”，誠以教師之一舉一動，其影響於兒童者甚大，是以教師之對付兒童，應出以　厚之情感，溫和之態度，高超之技能，以暗示兒童也。　　㈣教師應自身機械化　　夫全部機　，乃由各部零件配合而成，大而輪軸，小而螺釘，莫不各司其職，有所應用，若有一部分之損　，即足妨礙全體，教師之對於學校亦猶是也，假使學校之中，有一教師廢弛職務，　於工作，即足妨書學校全體，故吾輩既自命學者，不爲教師則已，既爲教師，即當矢勤矢勇，忠於　職，以身爲機械化，絕對不容有絲毫放縱也。　　綜上四端，誠爲教師之　護，苟能服應勿失，則吾國教育，其庶幾乎。讀者助學消息最後的機會　還在襄贊助學　　愛國愛民的偉大貢獻　　客問：“時局開　，和平實現，一般戰時的幸運兒，非法獲得的暴利，將如何處置？”　我說：“這確是值得研究的問題，要說如何處置，將來政府自有　衡，小民不必顧問。不過在目前倒有一個最後的機會，便是自動的在産業項下捐出一小部份，萬分之一也好，千分之一更好，拿來捐作助學金，以救濟清寒學子的失學。因爲前幾天上海有幾項急切的捐款，如空　求災……等，如今，事過境遷，需要減低，祇有助學金，尚在積極勸募，以應付即將開學的需要，在時間上說，誠有燃眉之急。”　　關於助學運動的意義，我們　經　述，毋　贅言，不特社會各界。公認爲最積極而最治本的舉措，即我中央政府，也不遺在遠，早經　獎這項救國救民的工作，是最有價值的運動，所以愛國者必愛民，愛民者必協力襄贊助學運動，以盡國民一份子的　務。大凡有識之士，愛護青年，救濟失學，爲社會栽培人材，爲國家培養元氣；應該人同此心，心同此理。其次，在道德方面講，所謂“助學最善，爲善最樂”。在此光榮勝利的當兒，想社會人士，亦必樂於接受數千學子誠　的要求，而遂行愛國愛民的願望。　　第九屆申報讀者助學金特別勸募隊　　榮譽隊　　第七三隊　戴雲臣隊（節省喜筵）　二百萬元　　第七四隊　世界和平國家中興紀念隊　一百萬元　　以上共收三百萬元，連前總計二萬四千四百八十一萬元。　　普通隊　　第四○○隊　崇裕記隊　二十三萬三千元　　第四○一隊　史幼方隊　十萬元　　第四○二隊　德昌呢號慶祝勝利隊　十萬元　　第四○三隊　李忠俊隊（義賣陰丹士林隊）　十萬元　　第四○四隊　求　氏慶祝昇平隊　十萬元　　以上共收六十三萬三千元，連前總計六千七百二十七萬二千元。　　昨收助金　章華公司，鄧秀榮，各五萬元，胡廉記，雲記，病足各二萬元，董長卿一萬七千元，信成二千五百元，浦緝庭二千元，以上共收十八萬一千五百元。電車今日起恢複全日行駛　交通公司便利市民　　上海交通公司爲便利市民交通，定今（十八）日起恢複白　行駛電車，暫先規定爲一路外洋涇橋至虹口公園間，二路靜安寺至南京路外灘間，五路東新橋至北火車站間，七路外洋涇橋至提籃橋間，八路提籃橋至楊樹浦底間，十六路泰興路至三洋涇橋間，二十一路靜安寺路至中山公園間，二十四路洛陽路至紀念塔間。又悉法商電車亦自即日起，採取同樣措置。娛樂場所規定九時半打烊　　警察局自昨（十六）日起，每晚十時實行　戒，凡一切娛樂場所，一概限營業至九時半止，即須打烊。各校校歷課程遵照戰前規程　教局通飭各校遵照辦理　　茲值學期開始，本市各公私立學校，均將籌備開學，聞教育局徐兼局長，爲使遵守民國二十六年以前教育部頒法令起見，特通飭各校開學日期，務須遵照二十年六月部頒之學校學年學期及休假日期規程辦理。至各級學校課程標凖，亦應遵照二十六年以前部頒之中學師範及小學規程辦理。昨日商情　　金融　　昨日給赤續見盤低，晨初六二○○關，再見五二○○關，午收五五○○關。錢業公會拆　仍掛六角五分未更，銀元四萬元，紋銀七萬元，聯鈔出入價十五元至廿元，已降低。　　公價　　昨晨統一公價亦見下跌，丙種晨開，由八萬元小至六萬元，旋又回昇，爲八萬一千元，正午七萬元小二萬元，甲乙種六萬五七千元，丁　種六萬八千及七萬元，共成交數十萬元。　　華股　　昨晨華股市況繼續小至限度，昨連日下降過巨，投資者略有進意，各方人心已見轉穩。紗廠做開低至三○○○○元，美亞一九○○○元，公司二○○○○元，景福一三○○元，中華電影五六○元，中國內衣一六○○元，其餘俱見軋降。　　米糧　　昨日米糧到貨轉旺，交易　　。市面一致一　，結果厚薄粳白元等貨回小七八十關，計開厚粳一七五關，薄稻一六五至一五○關，　尖一四○關至一三○關，　元一五○關，雜糧亦見下游，計開太倉黃荳二十六關，安慶黃豆二十四關，南京缸豆二十四關，次十一關，沙赤特三十八關，中關二十八關，苞米二○關，至十六關五級　　雜糧　　本市雜糧價格，在最近一二日內俱見下跌，南京黃豆三十萬元，沙赤四十五萬元，小麥三十五萬元，紅糧二十六萬元，常州牛皮黃二十五萬元，牛皮青二十六萬元，沙　二十五萬元，豇豆二十四萬元，麵粉特白一等二十九萬元，二白一等二十六萬元，二等二十四萬元，特白每一市觔九千二百七千元，二等六千元，食油青島落花生油一八八萬元，常州豆油一八五萬元，江北落花生油一八四萬元。　　日用品　　昨日日用品市面俱見下，計跌固本降至七十關，剪刀六十五關，白祥茂六十關，黃祥茂五十關，火柴鳳凰七○○關，洋燭白禮氏跌至七十關，　　六十五關，鷹牌七十關，以上敞開市價尚鮮買戶。　　捲煙　　昨日捲煙市面以報載中儲貨幣或將提高價值消息，人心堅穩，納胃呆稀，市勢慘跌，計大英降至一二五○關，老刀一○○○關，仙女八○○關，前門四三○　，全　四二○關，大高樂五萬元，中高樂三萬七千元，小高樂二萬八千元，白蘭地六萬元，中華門三萬三千元，克雷斯二萬八千元，百萬金一萬八千元，福華三萬五千元。　　藥品　　藥品市面均見回小，八卦丹六萬元，萬金油七萬元，糖精挫至七十關，奎寧一四○關。蘇北同鄉昨舉行茶會歡迎彭笑潮將軍　　國民政府軍事委員會特派蘇滬宜撫專員彭龍　（字笑潮）將軍，於兩月前到滬，隱居西區某處，頻與淪陷區各部隊商洽投誠事宜，均已就緒。茲者全面和平業已實現，蘇北各縣旅滬同鄉會代表以彭將軍數月工作，備極辛勞，昨日下午假泰山路蘿蔓飯店茶會歡迎，情緒熱烈。彭將軍即席致詞，茲將演詞錄次：　　彭氏演詞　　龍驤率軍委會命來蘇滬宣撫，到達上海將近兩月，因爲環境和任務上的關係，不能與各友好及地方父老晤談，非常抱歉。最近時局急轉，勝利到來，在此極愉快之時，承各同鄉於百忙中開會歡迎，很爲　奮，可是，因爲兄弟對地方及國家都未盡多大力量，又很覺慚愧。　　兄弟此來的主要任務，就是策動淪陷區部隊內向中央，最近時局急轉，日本已接受三國波次坦宦言，全面和平，業已實現，此間的軍政負責人員以及地方各界人士，都能仰體中央意旨，極力維護地方，使民衆在興奮之中，仍過著安定的生活，此點最使兄弟感佩的。　　在這時局急轉情緒緊張政令絕　之中，有許多關懷地方的熱心人士，提出不少重要問題，詢及兄弟，想在席諸君或亦同有此感，兄弟乘此機會，作一簡略之報告。　　首先顧慮者是治安問題，因爲抗戰多年，民生憔悴，部隊　雜，統率不一，彼此略有猜疑，勢所不免，要知抗戰目標在反抗侵略，收複失地，以祈求永久的和平，可說全國四萬萬五千萬人，無不同具此心，不過因環境上關係或許所採的方式不同罷了。現在和平實現，各處的軍警及一切行政人員，都能遵守中央的指示，站定崗位，竭力維持秩序，安定民生，雖祇有短短的幾天，但已隨處表現他們保衛地方的精神與成績，我想此種精神，必能繼續維持下去，況中央所派負責大員，已在途中，不日可到，是以蘇滬的治安，我想極無問題的。　　在各機關服務人員，在此轉　關頭，雖經中央一再宣示，教他們各安本位，努力服務，但是仍有少數人意志徬徨，起一種疑　的心理，兄弟認爲這種觀念是錯誤的，要知中央意旨素以寬大爲懷，其例不勝枚舉，即舉最近一例來說，中央對於解除武裝之日本軍人與日僑婦孺，一再宣佈，要保障他們的生命安全，不許予以虐待或侮辱，中央對已往之敵人尚如此寬大，那末對自己的同胞，還有不寬大的嗎？兄弟以爲各服務人員㈠要明白中央之意旨，㈡要問自己服務努力之如何，不必疑欋的。複次一般人士，憂慮著日軍撤退之際，國內各部隊防地雜處，調動頻繁，近雖趜於一致，而從前究屬對立，萬一引起誤會，治安堪虞，這一點也是過慮的，因爲國內任何部隊，任何集團，見解或有不問，思想或不一致，在此長長的抗戰過程中，是不免的現象，但其共同的目標則一，何況八年抗戰，人民受盡痛舊，誰不盼望安居樂業，誰不盼望休養生息，大家團結一致，走向民族複興之路，才對得起祖國，對得起人民，我想中央所昭示的國家大計，凡屬爲國宜勞的官兵，誰不明白誰不擁護，萬衆協力，共慶昇平，當然也無庸　憂的。　　抗戰期中破壞得太多了，將來的地方建設事宜，正是百廢待舉，希望大家在最高領袖指導之下，努力前進”。最後彭氏複就蘇北情形，作附帶之報告。社會服務空襲救濟捐款　今日起停止代收　　本處代收空襲救濟捐款，歷時一月，承各界熱心人士踴躍　將，截至昨日止共收到三萬七千六百○六萬六千七百元，除已付出救濟費三萬三千九百七十五萬元外，結存三千六百三十一萬六千七百元。是項捐款，自即日起中止代收，以資結束，尚希各界　　。林漢達先生講傳統教育弊病　　本報義務教育委員會主辦教育講座，定於明日（十九日），請林漢達先生講“傳統教育的弊病及其改進”。地點仍假山海關路四四五號市立育才中學，時間：上午九時至十一時。希各小學教師准時往聽。簡訊　　捐贈急救針劑　王家棟會計師事務所，昨再送來急救針六十支，囑爲轉送救濟醫院，供治療傷民之用。　　樹羣義務中學　初中三，高中一，尚有餘額，定於二十日三十日，續攷新生二次，報名每晚七至八時，上課時間每晚七至八時半，學雜費全免，校址：泰興路靜安寺路張家花園光明小學內。　　聯旦義務初級中學　定於九月一日開學，學費全免，初一·二·三年級，尚有餘額，校址：華龍路八十號。空襲救濟金捐款報告　十三　　邊　（合）一百萬元，協和成黃天池二十萬元，耿君，高君，石君各十萬元，方公館七萬元，馬君五萬元，無名記（收據九二七）一萬元。　　以上共收一百七十二萬元，連前結存三千六百三十一萬六千七百元。慈幼會捐款報告　　週母　儀移助二百萬元，郭起蕃一百七十萬元，李企　經募一百六十萬元，　志學續捐壽儀移助，羅洪義，徐長春，張瑞棠合捐各一百萬元，吳慎之經募九十萬元，孫變元經募　　　　　募各七十一萬元，高　良經募六十二萬元，大中華橡膠廠續捐三十九萬一千五百元，張　耿經募，詹沛霖，　毛　文　　各三千萬元，陳　　經募二十八萬五千元，　　　經募二十五萬元，夏士　　捐二十尤元，　　才續募十七萬五千元，朱家　　募十一萬八千元，　　　續募，滙中銀行，同豐五金號，黃振世，　Cojlin，立大　　　，　守律陳文奎合　　　　　，沈德華，曹芝　　　生各十萬元，　　　　萬元，王玉書，朱　　，志成，源隆，　生，宏興紙業公司各五萬元，胡慕瑗，八仙橋中南銀行，益泰商業銀行，土菸絲同業公會，徐安瀾，呂　週各二萬元，劉子欽，徐祖祥，福利錢莊，保安居士，林榮維各一萬元，勤康紙號三千元，上收一千四百十九萬二千五百元。連前總計一萬另八百廿九萬七千四百元。各種車輛及駕駛人逾期換照處罰辦法　　上海特別市建設局頃公布各種車輛及駕駛人逾期換照掉牌驗照處罰暫行辦法如下：　　第一條，凡屬本市區轄境內，所有各種車輛牌照（包括援助車許可證）暨汽車司機人執照三輪車夫駕駛執照，人力車夫執照，已逾規定期間申請，換照，掉牌，驗照者，其罰則暫依本辦法辦理。　　第二條，凡各種機動車（自用汽車·營業汽車·自用運貨汽車·營業運貨汽車·機器腳踏車·汽車試車）家用車（自用人力車·自用馬車·自用三輪人力車·）公用車與送貨車（營業人力車·營業三輪人力車·三輪車試車·汽胎輪貨車·鐵輪貨車·三輪腳踏車·腳踏車·雙人腳踏車·三輪送貨車·小車·水車·　車·營業馬車·馬拖運貨車·）逾期申請核照或掉牌及機動車許可證者，概科罰　國幣二千元。　　第三條，凡機動車·家用車·公用車與送貨車等，逾期未經申請換照，或掉牌及機動車換領許可證，而仍繼續使用，被本局　查車輛人員查獲者，科罰　國幣二千元，並得吊銷牌照三日至一星期，待執行期滿後，仍須責令照章申請換照或掉牌。　　第四條，如經警務機關查獲過期尚未換照或掉牌，暨汽車許可證之機動車·家用車·及公用車與送貨車，經通知本局後，本局得參照本辦法第三條規定辦理之。　　第五條，凡逾期申請換照，或掉牌換領許可證，及被查扣未換照，及掉牌或換領汽車許可證之機動車·家用車·公用車·與送貨車，其所虧欠　　，得照章通知財政局，責令補繳，並須將補繳車捐之舊照呈驗，方准換發新牌照，或汽車許可證。　　第六條，凡意圖偷漏車捐，申請補照之機動車·家用車·公用車與送貨車，如經本局查明屬實，應依照本辦法第三第五兩條之規定辦理之。　　第七條，凡汽車司機人（包括車主與車夫）逾期申請驗照，或換照者，一律科以罰　二千元，其逾期在三個月至半年者，除罰　外，並吊銷執照半月，在半年以上一年以下者，除罰　外，並吊銷執照一月，在一年以上者，除罰　外，並吊銷執照二個月至六個月。　　第八條，凡汽車駕駛人，逾期申請驗照，或換照而仍繼續駕駛車輛。被本局稽查車輛人員或警務人員查獲時，本局得依照本辦法第七條之規定，加倍處罰之。　　第九條，凡　　車夫，及人力車夫逾期申請驗照或換照者，依照下列辦理之。　　㈠逾期一個月至三個月，申請換照或驗照者三輪車夫處罰　二千元，人力車夫處罰　五百元。　　㈡逾期三個月以上，至半年以下，申請換照驗照者，三輪車夫處罰　二千元，吊銷執照一星期，人力車夫罰　一千五百元。　　㈢逾期半年以上至一年以下，申請換照或驗照者三輪車夫處罰　二千元，吊銷執照二星期，人力車夫處罰　二千元，吊銷執照一星期。　　㈣逾期一年以上，申請換照或驗照者三輪車夫，罰　二千元，並吊銷執照四星期至六星期，人力車夫科罰　二千元，並吊銷執照二星期。　　第十條，凡三輪車夫及人力車夫，逾期未經申請換照或驗照而被本局稽查車輛人員或警務人員查獲時，本局得依照本辦法第九條之規定處罰之。管理馬車行規則　　第一條　凡在本市區內，以出租馬車爲營業之商號，除將股東，經理，姓名，地址，資本數額，開設地點及組織大　等報候經濟局辦理商業登記外，應向建設局報請行基登記，隨繳登記費國幣十五萬元，執照費二萬元，印花稅二十元，領取建設局財政局會印之執照，並向財政局繳納營業執照費。（甲）一至三輛者每季應納費一千五百元。（乙）四輛至五輛者，每季應納費三千元。（丙）五輛以上者，每季應納費六千元，方得開業，嗣後應於每季首月十五日以前，向財政局繳納營業執照費，由局於執照上粘貼印花，加蓋印章，發還備用，如逾期不繳，得處以上季以上應繳季費之罰金　　第二條　馬車行開業執照限於本年有效，每屆年度開始，須換領新照，如不換領新照，並不呈報停業，建設局得處以二千元以下之罰　，仍補正手續。　　第三條　　馬車行開業執照，應懸掛行內顯明地位，並僅適用於領有執照之行屋。　　第四條　馬車行遷移地址，擴充營業，並增添車輛時，均報請建設局備案，並須繳納執照費，換領開業執照，及向財政局補繳營業執照季費。　　第五條　馬車行拴放馬匹，不得有約束不完全之情形，違者處二千元以下之罰　。　　第六條　馬車行出租馬車價格之訂定，或修改望遠鏡　應事先呈請建設局核准。　　第七條　馬車行對於建設局稽查員，或財政局調查員執行職務時，應予便利，不得有拒絕行爲。　　第八條　馬車行停止營業時，應將執照向建設局繳銷，並呈報財政局備查，如讓與他人時，除繳銷執照外，讓受人並應依照第二條之規定，請領新執照。　　第九條　馬車行如有違反上列條款，除科處罰　外，建設局得按其情節輕重，暫時收回或吊銷其執照。　　第十條　馬車行違反本規則各項條款，經建設局暫時收回或吊銷其執照者，非將所違犯條款改正發還執照後，不得營業。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Address: The Belief of Eight Years of Striving for Victory is Realized Today, Permanent Peace is Based on Mutual Love Among Humanity</h3>
<p>Seventeenth, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Chongqing broadcast: Chairman Chiang held a broadcast to the world and all Chinese people at 10:00 AM on the fifteenth. The original words are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, soldiers and civilians of the whole country, peace-loving people of the world:</p>
<p>Our justice has triumphed over might, and this has finally been proven in fact. This fact is also the success of our National Revolution's history. My China's belief of eight years of struggle in the darkness has now been realized. Regarding the peace that appears before us, we must thank the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves since the beginning of our national resistance, thank the allies who fought together for justice and peace, and especially thank the Father of the Nation for leading us through the arduous path of revolutionary policy, enabling us to have this day of victory and success. Christians all over the world should also thank the merciful and omnipotent God.</p>
<p>My fellow countrymen, since the start of the War of Resistance, the suffering of the eight years has deepened day by day, but the belief in the War of Resistance has also grown stronger day by day. In particular, our compatriots in the occupied areas have suffered endless devastation and oppression, and have tasted hardship to the utmost. But today, they have finally achieved complete liberation and are seeing the light of day again. In recent years, the cheers and joy of soldiers and civilians in various places have overshadowed the past sorrow. The main significance is that the compatriots in the occupied areas have been liberated.</p>
<p>Now the War of Resistance has been victorious, but this is not the final victory. We must know that the meaning of war is not just another victory in the world, but even more so that the power of this victory is the common power of the world.</p>
<p>I believe that all of humanity in the world, and all Chinese compatriots, must unanimously hope that this war is the last war in which civilized countries of the world have participated in fighting. If this is indeed the last war, then although our compatriots have suffered indescribable and cruel pain, our gains from this are satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation, living in the darkest of times, has been able to continuously strive with consistent benevolence and traditional spirit, knowing deeply that sacrifice for justice and humanity will surely receive due reward.</p>
<p>The mutual cooperation and respect that has arisen among the nations united by war around the world is the price of this war.</p>
<p>The Great Wall of anti-aggression built by the blood and flesh of the youth of our United Nations is not just a temporary alliance, but a common belief of mankind, a permanent combination. This is the foundation of the United Nations' victory and can never be destroyed by any enemy conspiracy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that from now on, without distinction of region or race, the unity of mankind will surely deepen, like brothers and sisters. This war has promoted the belief and relationship of mutual respect and assistance among mankind, and further proves that world war and peace are inseparable. This is also sufficient evidence to prevent war from breaking out again in the future.</p>
<p>Here, I think of the words in Christ's teachings, "Treat others as you would like to be treated," and "Love your enemies," and I have endless feelings.</p>
<p>We must know that being kind to others is our traditional spirit. We have consistently stated that we are only enemies with the Japanese militarists, and will never be enemies with the Japanese people. Now that the Japanese militarists have been defeated, we must of course hold them responsible for faithfully implementing the terms of surrender. However, we must never attempt to humiliate the Japanese. We should show compassion to them and to the people who have been oppressed and humiliated by the Nazi militarists, and urge them to extricate themselves from sin.</p>
<p>We must know that answering past atrocities with atrocities will lead to endless cycles of revenge, which would lose the original meaning of a benevolent and righteous army. This is what every one of our soldiers and civilians should pay special attention to now.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, now that aggression has been defeated, we have not yet reached our true goal. We must thoroughly eliminate its aggressive background and potential.</p>
<p>We must also know that the reward of victory is definitely not extravagance and indolence.</p>
<p>We must know that the work after the end of the war requires us to take greater efforts to be responsible for reform and reconstruction.</p>
<p>At some point, we will feel that the reality is even more arduous and difficult than during the war. This reality may come upon us at any time and any place.</p>
<p>The work that will be more difficult than war in the future is how to make ordinary ×× workers who have been purely led understand their own mistakes, accept the Three Principles of the People, and understand which is reasonable, strength or justice. This is a task that China and the Allies must work hard on in the future.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the permanent peace of the world is built on the spirit of human democracy, mutual assistance and universal love. We should move towards this goal.</p>
<p>I urge all allied nations and the people of the country to believe that peace obtained by force is not permanent peace. The realization of permanent peace requires us to conquer the enemy on the battlefield of reason, make them deeply repent and return to believers in peace, and then we will achieve permanent peace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Warns Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Beiping, Seventeenth, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Embassy in Beiping recently issued a statement, warning overseas Chinese not to misunderstand the intentions of the authorities and take rash actions, such as buying up supplies or withdrawing deposits. It also stated that the embassy will do its best to provide overseas Chinese with convenience regarding the supply of essential goods such as food, the security of bank deposits, and the transfer of funds to their home country.</p>
<h3>Over Four Hundred US Warships Lost in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Chongqing dispatch, citing Washington news, the US Navy announced on the fifteenth that the US Navy had lost a total of 435 warships in the Pacific, of which 264 were sunk.</p>

<h3>Propaganda Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission, He Minhun, Issues Proclamation</h3>
<p>He Minhun, a Propaganda Committee member of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission, responsible for counter-propaganda work in the southeastern regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, has established a temporary office. Yesterday, he issued the following proclamation:</p>
<p>To the Elders, Brothers, Sisters, and Compatriots of the Three Provinces:</p>
<p>The Japanese government has finally decided to surrender unconditionally. The ultimate victory of the sacred War of Resistance has been achieved. The long-awaited dawn has finally arrived. The arduous struggle of the entire nation over the past eight years, and the profound suffering you have endured in the occupied territories, have not been in vain. Now, with the affection of brothers and sisters, we extend to you our highest respect and sincere condolences!</p>
<p>The disarming of the Japanese troops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and all other occupied areas, and all peaceful reconstruction and restoration work, are being comprehensively planned by our Central Government and are being carried out separately. The Central Government also has concrete and complete policies for the future national construction plan, which will be advanced in an orderly manner. In this extraordinary period when light arrives and darkness disappears, there are more than ten thousand words we want to say to our compatriots in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. With a solemn and earnest attitude, we make the following agreements with our elders, brothers, and sisters:</p>
<p>1. In the wake of this great victory and during the Central Government's restoration work, do not act emotionally. Refrain from any short-sighted, immature actions or revenge-driven acts that do not contribute to the overall situation or even hinder the progress of peace.</p>
<p>2. While enjoying the joy of restoration, do not forget to treat Japanese women, children, and residents who are law-abiding and kind, as well as Japanese soldiers who have been completely disarmed, with a broad-minded, benevolent, and moral attitude befitting a great nation.</p>
<p>3. Do your best to assist our Central Government's working comrades (those with identification documents) in carrying out restoration work and provide them with all possible conveniences.</p>
<p>4. Extend the highest respect and sincere condolences to the anti-Japanese patriots released from enemy gendarmerie units or prisons, and to the Allied nationals who have regained their freedom from various concentration camps. Provide them with assistance in their lives to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>5. People in industry and commerce should continue to peacefully pursue their respective occupations, maintain the supply of essential goods for the people with harmony and cooperation. Various industry organizations should also wait quietly for reorganization.</p>
<p>6. Do your utmost to protect all public buildings and public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation in various places, and maintain their full use.</p>
<p>7. Under the leadership of our Party and League comrades, all localities should immediately raise the national flag, convene mass meetings of the people, and hold various gatherings to celebrate this unprecedented great victory in our country's history.</p>
<p>8.

<p>Long live the hardworking and meritorious Chairman Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Sketch of Puyuan Town in Jiaxing</p>
<p>By Yucheng</p>
<p>Puyuan Town is located southwest of Jiaxing City. The water comes from Tianmu Mountain, called Youhu Lake, also called Meihua Jing, which connects to the Rouge River in the east of the city. During the Spring and Autumn period of Wu and Yue, Fan Li carried Xi Shi here, so the water is beautiful and the people are peaceful. There are many famous scenic spots and historical sites. The locals are diligent in physical labor but neglect repairs, so the ancient legends have changed to this day. During the Southern Song Dynasty, Emperor Gaozong passed by here in a phoenix-drawn carriage. He asked the scholars and learned that it was Wutong Township. Believing that phoenixes only dwell in wutong trees, he settled his family here. Emperor Lizong bestowed the name Puyuan. Afterwards, the population gradually increased, and the Yan, Dang, Shi, and Si families were the most prominent. In the early Ming Dynasty, Lady Wa Jiuniang taught children to manage warp and weft threads, creating silk fabrics that were sold far and wide, from Huguang in the south to Pingjin in the north. To this day, it is still called silk town. Zhu Yizun's "Lake Rights Song" says, "Casually passing over Lady Jiu's Bridge in Puyuan, the sound of weaving girls can be heard at midnight," which gives a glimpse of the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The southern highway to Jiaxing City is thirty-two li. There are two buses daily, coming from Tongxiang, passing through Yuhui Township, Guojie Bridge, bypassing the south gate of Jiaxing, and then driving to the north gate. It takes about an hour to reach the railway. Most of the bridges along the road have collapsed and are supported by planks and trees, often in a state of collapse. The waterway south to Xiashi is thirty li, and to Wangdian is twenty li. There are fast boats, two daily, departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. The North Canal to Wuzhen is thirty li, and to Shimen is the same. To Xincheng is twenty-four li. In recent years, the bandits are not peaceful, and there is often vigilance.</p>
<p>Local Products</p>
<p>Tobacco Leaves: Approximately 5,000 dan are produced annually. Locals collect and process them in the summer, drying them with bamboo clips, and selling them to commercial firms. In the past, they were only used for dry and damp tobacco, but now they are also used as ordinary cigarettes. The taste is spicier and less fragrant, similar to that produced in Shudian Temple in Tongxiang. The price has risen in recent years, and a summer's business is quite considerable. Most of the local tobacco leaf businesses lack capital and sell to the city at any time, commonly known as "small masters," as they earn a commission.</p>
<p>Hemp Skin: Seeds are sown in the spring and grow until midsummer. The skin is stripped from the stalks and used as fuel. From June to July every year, it is collected from the surrounding villages and sold to the Jiangsu region. It can be used to make coarse hemp thread. The color is solid and the material is hard, not as widely used as white hemp, but it is produced annually and is regarded by the villagers as an important product.</p>
<p>Cypress Seeds: Produced in the southern villages of the town. The trees grow naturally and are not planted. They rely entirely on the connection between wild and domestic cypress trees, and it takes several years for them to bear seeds. They often grow on the banks of rivers and streams. In late autumn, there are many red leaves, and the flowers bloom brilliantly. In September and October, rice shops collect them, pressing them for oil to make candles, and they are indispensable in high-quality soaps and machine oil. Tens of thousands of dan are sold annually. In recent years, the felling of trees in the surrounding villages has reduced the production of cypress seeds. Within ten li, maple leaves are very rare. Replenishment and growth are slow.</p>
<p>Cloth: The history is very long. In the early Republic, iron looms were used, and the width of the fabric was increased to two feet. Most of them are made of local silk and are still durable. After 1927, the production of silk from various places increased daily, and business declined sharply. In addition, the people of the town considered the labor cost too low, so they abandoned this and changed to other businesses. Therefore, production is decreasing daily. Recently, due to the scarcity of cloth and high prices, making it difficult to purchase, the sale of silk has increased again, but only within a hundred-li radius. The sales volume is still extensive, but fashionable people think that the quality of the goods is practical and not suitable for women's clothing, so it is difficult to circulate smoothly.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Before the incident, there was Jingye Complete Primary School, and Duanben Women's Primary School. Schools continued to open in 1938, and Meijing Middle School was established, adding Miaoqiao Primary School. In addition to the educational funds subsidized by the Jiaxing and Tongxiang districts, local donations and taxes are also used. The economy is not exhausted. Therefore, the teachers of one primary school have a monthly rice allowance, and their teaching is conscientious. Moreover, gentlemen such as Zhu Zhong are all normal school teachers, so the students are diligent, and the market guards the law, and the customs are simple and original, and the temperature is better than other towns in Tangbei. Recently, troops have been stationed to defend the highway, and some residents have to move. Often, old houses are unattended, and 30% of them are demolished and sold. Broken walls and ruins are everywhere, which remains to be rebuilt. The Daughter Bridge, Meijing, and Youhu Farm, covering hundreds of acres, with flowers and fruits gathered, and tourists stopping, are now frequently damaged, and the trails are desolate. The Sijia Bridge and the river are filled in, leaving only a corner of the red wall of the Liguan Zen Temple. Ten years ago, I often passed by here. Now, when I go there again, my eyes are different, and I can hardly tell what direction it is. I asked the villagers for directions to return, and I saw that the fishing and fishing places were covered with grass.</p>
<p>Public Security</p>
<p>The police station is located in the old house of Tan Gongyi Pawnshop, but now it has moved elsewhere. During the clearing period, the four suburbs of the town were fortified, and there were guards and inspections, which were very strict. Although there are bandits, there are not many incidents. In recent years, gambling has become more prevalent, and tea houses and restaurants stop cooking in the afternoon, and the people live in peace. The Fanyun Taoist Temple and the Xianghai Zen Temple, every time the Buddha is born, worship Guanyin. In the year of turmoil, the fields are deserted, and there is no repentance. It is said that the custom of respect and concession is still being studied. Xia Xinming revised Puyuan Zhi in thirty volumes, adding detailed revisions, and his expenses were donated independently, without raising a penny from the local area. However, charity is gradually becoming cold, and the old and weak who lack food and firewood often have no way to support themselves, and rely on the strong to help them. (Move rewards to help students)</p>

<h3>Household Flour Universally Distributed Starting Yesterday</h3>
<h3>One Municipal Catty Per Person Sold for 2,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>The household flour for this period in this city has been allocated to various retail rice shops by the Shanghai District Flour Allocation Office of the Flour and Wheat Organization Committee. Supervised by the Municipal Economic Bureau, universal distribution began yesterday (the 17th). One municipal catty per person, priced at 2,500 yuan. However, because a portion of the flour has not yet been transported, some retail rice shops have not received their allocated flour. It is expected that it will be transported and distributed in two or three days. It is understood that the flour and wheat organization agency will continue to maintain the household flour distribution until the people's food problem is fully resolved.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Suspends Trading</h3>
<p>With the continuous sharp decline in the prices of Chinese stocks and thin trading volume, the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange specially announced yesterday that trading would be suspended from today (the 18th).</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Decline in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The prices of Chinese stocks have repeatedly plummeted recently, reaching a point where no one is interested. It is understood that the repeated decline in Chinese stocks is due to the following reasons: 1. Large holders have already considered them as investment targets, and new capital inflow has stopped. 2. Speculators purchased stocks by borrowing against them, but suddenly encountered the firms stopping lending, forcing them to painfully sell off to repay old debts, creating an oversupply. 3. Public sentiment is cold, everyone is watching, and the shorts have been hit head-on. 4. The firms have stopped overdrafts, and many payment instruments have been returned. Brokers have had to pay on behalf of clients due to transaction restrictions, causing prices to continue to fall, resulting in brokers suffering their own losses. 5. Small investors are panic-stricken, and many longs are seeking to sell.</p>
<h3>Fifth Series Gold Certificates to be Cashed Starting Today</h3>
<p>The fifth series of gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank, after changing its method on July 29th and entrusting brokers in the securities market to sell them at market prices, were originally scheduled to be cashed in gold on September 30th. Now, due to the change in the situation, in order to demonstrate credibility, it has been decided to advance the cashing of gold to today (the 18th). Those who hold fifth series gold certificates can go to the bank at No. 23 Bund today to cash them in, with the fraction valued at 7 million yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Gold Certificate Market Still Open Yesterday</h3>
<p>The gold certificate market was still open as usual yesterday, but due to the sluggish market, no transactions were made, and there was no official market price. According to news from the market, the market is still open as usual every day to maintain business.</p>
<h3>Various Firms Ending Trust Business</h3>
<p>In order to prudently manage their operations, the silver and money businesses in this city have temporarily suspended all lending. All previously loaned funds, whether or not they have matured, are being actively processed for settlement. It is also learned that the trust businesses of various banks are difficult to continue at present and a decision has been made to end them. They will be resumed in the future when needed.</p>
<h3>National Forum: The Responsibilities of Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>By Zhang Chengyun</p>
<p>Nowadays, those who are elementary school teachers often regard the teaching position as a long journey and are afraid of teaching people. Alas! This is why our country's academics have not made progress so far. Education is the lifeblood of the nation, so those who bear the responsibility of education should regard education as a lifelong career. Mencius regarded educating the talents of the world as one of the three joys, because diligently teaching people is to loyally plan for the country. From this point of view, how great is the task of those who bear the responsibility of education! But all the tasks are nothing more than the following points:</p>
<p>1. Educating Children</p>
<p>The teacher's education of children is like a farmer's cultivation of fields. If a farmer cultivates the fields, he must diligently cultivate and carefully protect them, then he may have the hope of a bumper harvest. The teacher's education of children must also be diligently guided and carefully enticed, then the children will have visible progress. Although children have different endowments of intelligence and stupidity, they should be treated like gardeners observing the nature of plants and distinguishing the suitability of the soil, or with deep plowing, or with shallow planting, or with strong fertilization, or with light watering, and they should be patiently and kindly induced to become successful.</p>
<p>2. Should Have a Research Spirit</p>
<p>Confucius, who was tireless in teaching people, still had to learn without being satisfied first. The way of learning is as vast as the sea, and the world is changing day by day, so civilization is advancing day by day. Without diligent research, how can there be deep understanding? Therefore, all teachers must have a research spirit. But what I call research is not only to seek it from books and newspapers. There is a saying: "Good at borrowing." It is also said: "The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade." Therefore, although it is said to be research, it is especially necessary to learn from teachers and friends, discuss with each other, and then prejudices will be eliminated, and reason will be seen.</p>
<p>3. Teachers Should Lead by Example</p>
<p>The reason why Confucius was able to become a model for all ages is that his actions were a model for the world, and his words were a law for the world, so he was able to gain the heartfelt admiration of his disciples. From this point of view, personality influence is what teachers should pay attention to. The American Philip also said: "Teachers should pay attention to everything they say." The influence of a teacher's every move on children is very great, so the teacher's treatment of children should be with sincere feelings, gentle attitudes, and superb skills to inspire children.</p>
<p>4. Teachers Should Mechanize Themselves</p>
<p>A complete machine is made up of parts. Large and small, from axles to screws, all perform their duties. If a part is damaged, it will hinder the whole. The teacher's relationship to the school is also the same. If there is a teacher in the school who neglects his duties and is lazy in his work, it will hinder the whole school. Therefore, since we claim to be scholars, we should not be teachers; if we are teachers, we should be diligent and brave, loyal to our duties, and be mechanized, and we must not allow the slightest indulgence.</p>
<p>In summary, these four points are the protection of teachers. If they can be followed without error, then our country's education may be close to success.</p>
<h3>Reader's Aid to Education News</h3>
<h3>Last Chance to Help Support Education</h3>
<h3>A Great Contribution to Patriotism and Loving the People</h3>
<p>A guest asked, "With the opening of the situation and the realization of peace, how will the wartime lucky ones and the illegally obtained profits be dealt with?"</p>
<p>I said, "This is indeed a question worth studying. As for how to deal with it, the government will naturally have its own consideration in the future, and the common people need not worry about it. However, there is a last chance at the moment, which is to voluntarily donate a small portion of the industrial income, even if it is one ten-thousandth, or better yet, one thousandth, to be donated as educational aid to help poor students who are out of school. Because a few days ago, there were several urgent donations in Shanghai, such as the air raid disaster relief, etc. Now that the situation has passed, the need has decreased. Only the educational aid is still being actively solicited to meet the needs of the upcoming school year. In terms of time, it is truly urgent."</p>
<p>The significance of the education assistance movement has been described before and will not be repeated. Not only is it recognized by all sectors of society as the most proactive and fundamental measure, but also our central government has not spared any effort and has long commended this work of saving the country and the people as the most valuable movement. Therefore, patriots must love the people, and those who love the people must cooperate and support the education assistance movement to fulfill the duties of a national member. All people of insight, who care for young people, relieve out-of-school students, cultivate talents for society, and cultivate vitality for the country, should have the same heart and the same reason. Secondly, in terms of morality, the so-called "helping education is the best, and doing good is the most joyful." At this moment of glorious victory, I think people from all walks of life will also be happy to accept the sincere request of thousands of students and fulfill their wishes to love the country and the people.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Compatriots Hold Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome General Peng Xiaochao</h3>
<p>General Peng Longxian (courtesy name Xiaochao), a special envoy of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government for soothing Jiangsu and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai two months ago and lived in seclusion in a certain area in the western district. He frequently discussed surrender matters with various troops in the occupied areas, and all matters have been settled. Now that overall peace has been realized, representatives of the Northern Jiangsu County Associations in Shanghai held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Roman Hotel on Taishan Road to welcome General Peng for his hard work over the past few months. The atmosphere was warm. General Peng delivered a speech on the spot. The speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Peng's Speech</p>
<p>"Longxiang was ordered by the Military Affairs Commission to come to Jiangsu and Shanghai to appease the people. It has been nearly two months since I arrived in Shanghai. Due to the environment and the nature of my mission, I have not been able to meet with friends and local elders, which I deeply regret. Recently, the situation has changed rapidly, and victory has arrived. At this very happy time, I am very grateful that my fellow countrymen have taken the time to hold this welcome meeting. However, I also feel very ashamed because I have not done much for the local area and the country.</p>
<p>The main task for my coming here was to persuade the troops in the occupied areas to turn to the Central Government. Recently, the situation has changed rapidly, and Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration of the Three Powers. Overall peace has been realized. The military and political officials and local people in charge here have been able to uphold the Central Government's intentions and do their best to maintain the local area, allowing the people to continue to live a stable life amidst the excitement. This point is most admirable to me.</p>
<p>In this time of rapid change, tense emotions, and the cessation of government orders, there are many enthusiastic people who care about the local area and have raised many important questions, asking me about them. I think the gentlemen present here may also have the same feelings. I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief report.</p>
<p>The first concern is the issue of public security. Because of the many years of the War of Resistance, the people have suffered, and the troops are mixed and disorganized, with inconsistent leadership. It is inevitable that there will be some suspicion among them. It should be known that the goal of the War of Resistance is to resist aggression and recover lost territories, in order to seek lasting peace. It can be said that all 450 million people in the country share this goal, but perhaps the methods adopted are different due to environmental factors. Now that peace has been realized, the military police and all administrative personnel in various places are able to abide by the instructions of the Central Government, stand firm in their posts, and do their best to maintain order and stabilize the people's livelihood. Although it has only been a few short days, they have already shown their spirit and achievements in defending the local area everywhere. I think this spirit will definitely be maintained in the future. Moreover, the responsible officials sent by the Central Government are already on their way and will arrive in the near future. Therefore, I think there is no problem with public security in Jiangsu and Shanghai.</p>
<p>As for the personnel serving in various agencies, at this turning point, although the Central Government has repeatedly declared that they should stay in their posts and work hard, there are still a few people who are hesitant and have a kind of doubtful psychology. I think this view is wrong. It should be known that the Central Government's intention has always been to be lenient. There are countless examples of this. To give just one recent example, the Central Government has repeatedly announced that it will guarantee the safety of life for the Japanese soldiers and Japanese women and children who have been disarmed and will not allow them to be mistreated or insulted. The Central Government is so lenient to its former enemies, so will it not be lenient to its own compatriots? I think all service personnel 1. should understand the intentions of the Central Government, 2. should ask themselves how hard they have worked, and should not be suspicious. Furthermore, the general public is worried that when the Japanese troops withdraw, the defense areas of domestic troops will be mixed and deployments will be frequent. Although they are now close to unity, they were previously opposed to each other. If misunderstandings arise, public security will be worrying. This is also an overestimation. Because any troops or any group in the country may have different views or different ideas. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the long War of Resistance. But their common goal is the same. What's more, after eight years of War of Resistance, the people have suffered so much, who doesn't want to live and work in peace, who doesn't want to recuperate and rejuvenate, and everyone should unite and work together towards the road of national rejuvenation, which is worthy of the motherland and the people. I think the national plan announced by the Central Government, all officers and soldiers who work for the country should understand and support it. Everyone works together to celebrate peace, and of course there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>Too much has been destroyed during the War of Resistance. In the future, local construction matters are in dire need of attention. I hope that everyone will work hard under the guidance of the Supreme Leader." Finally, Peng made a supplementary report on the situation in northern Jiangsu.</p>
