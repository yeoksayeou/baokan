<p>二十二分鐘內莊嚴典禮素描</p>
<p>東京灣美艦米蘇里號二日合衆電　靜默之日方官員，於二十二分鐘莊嚴　單之典禮中，以日本帝國無條件投降於聯合國，在互艦沉寂之朝天砲下，聯合國各代表迅速簽字於黑色封面之日文降書及金綠色封面之英文降書上。在典禮順利進行之際，盟國作戰飛機八百餘架，在空中上下翱翔，最後一度表顯盟國之空軍力量。麥克沃塞元帥鎮靜嚴肅，主持開幕禮，發表簡短演說。日代表重光葵利用一木腿前行（渠之腿於十三年前之一二八在上海被炸受創）移動，敵使自衣袋中掏取自來水筆，看一時表，又看另一時表，旋取出其筆，擬簽字時，發覺無墨水，最後以美代表借予之筆簽字，麥帥遂眉　不悅之色，重光面無表情。繼而日代表梅津美治郞移正其牛角邊之眼鏡，上前爲日帝國大本營迅速簽字，麥帥亦簽字，渠仍戴金色辮邊之便帽，如其渡太平洋歸返在海灘上所戴者，渠代表全體盟國簽字。中·英·蘇·澳·加·法·荷及紐西蘭各國代表相繼簽字，麥帥肅然步至揚聲簡前宣稱，但願和平重返世界，上帝使和平得常保持，此一典禮巳吿結束。</p>
<p>日版圖依規定縮爲本土四島</p>
<p>將近本日上午十時（東京時間）之際，日本版圖在波次坦條款規定下，巳縮小爲本土四島及盟方所將許其保有之其他若干小島。日本人民政府天皇及工業，今歸麥克沃塞統治，以迄日本被允加入舊金山會議所計劃之世界機構時爲止。重光倚杖呆立，典禮完畢時，渠帮同收受降書，日代表指出加代表柯斯格萊夫簽字錯誤一行問題，在麥帥之參謀長與日代表會商下迅速解決，監視典禮者爲經歷珍珠港。馬尼刺·新加坡·香港諸役之人員數人，繼麥克沃塞爲菲島美軍魏銳特將軍，最後防守新加坡之英軍總司令波西菲，美第二艦隊司令海爾賽，會在緬境作戰之史迪威以及其他官員二十人，均參加典禮。麥帥上前簽字時，詢曾逍日軍拘禁甚久之魏銳特及波西菲二人曰，「與余同上前簽字否」，麥帥微露興奮之色，持渠所用五枝筆之第一枝時手徽顫動，惟在開始書第一個字時，渠巳把穩，遂以該筆贈魏銳特，用過第二枝筆後，以之贈波西菲，繼而輪流用其他三枝筆，迅速簽字完畢，該三枝筆將分贈盟國顯要。重光·梅津離米蘇里號時，適當渠等登該艦半小時之後，二人向外國　要三十餘人，高級陸軍軍官四十餘人，海軍軍官五十餘人，盟國記者，攝影記者，　集高處甚至高與雀巢相齊之船員及被釋之戰俘共二百三十八人點首告別。</p>

<p>華盛頓二日電　美總統杜魯門於二日晨日本正式投降後，作廣播演說，宣布九月二日爲勝利日，演詞大意如下：「自今日起吾人將進入一新世紀，吾聯合國亦將共同進入一新的　更佳的國際合作和平　世界。吾人能獲得此結果者，乃上帝之佑也。今者，毀滅世界文化之企圖，巳被粉碎，但吾人永不能忘「珍珠港」之敎訓，而日本軍人亦將不忘「米蘇里」號。日軍　之罪行將永遠遺留於世人之腦海中，彼等原擬籍其武力以征服全世界人類，但此企圖巳完全被粉碎，其海陸軍現巳成為虛弱無能之器具矣。日本之正式投降，並非吾人僅賴武器而獲得之勝利，此項之勝利乃是克復暴虐者之自由勝利。吾人際此慶祝勝利之時，謹向在戰爭中殉職之戰士及吾人之偉大領導者亦即是民主主義之保衛者，故羅斯福總統致最高敬禮。從今日起吾人須與其他盟國緊密合作，以維持世界之永久和平。吾人未來之困難尙多，但望以過去四年之勇敢及忍耐精神，繼續努力不懈。雖然隨勝利而來之負擔及責任甚爲繁重，但吾人深信美國必能聯合各盟國建立以公理平等忍耐爲基礎之世界和平。</p>

<h3 id="c10">國民黨告全國同胞書　盼望一心一德完成建國偉業 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>中央社重慶二日電　中國國民黨爲抗戰勝利，吿全國同胞書，全文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞們！當此抗戰勝利，全國騰歡，想能記憶國父一句名言「夫事有順乎天理，應乎人情，適乎世界之潮流，合乎人　之需要，而爲先知先覺者所決志行之，則斷無不成者，此古今革命維新興邦建國等事業是也」。</p>
<p>國父遺敎如響斯應</p>
<p>這句話在勝利的今日，固覺得如　斯應。論建國的前途，更好是耳提面命，首先是本黨遵照國父遣教，領導國民革命，爭取中國下獲得成功，而在這一成功之中，確巳實現了「日本即欲實行其侵略政策，中國人亦必出而拒絕之，即不幸中國爲日本所佔領，不論何時何處，亦斷非日本所能統治而有利」的遺敎，更實現了「民國以前吾黨本主義以建立民國，民國以後則本主義以捍衛民國」的遺敎。國父曾指出「吾黨實聚中國之存亡，使吾黨弛而不張，則中國或幾乎息」。五十年革命歷史，八年餘抗戰紀錄，都說明了本黨的努力奮鬥，與中國存亡實有不可分亂的關係，但國父也指出國民革命是國民之事，人人應負革命之責，我同胞今後自更當記取國父的敎導，自強不息，爲建國大業成功的保證。</p>
<p>三民五權立國極則</p>
<p>其次，國父創立的三民主義·五權憲法，實爲立國的極則·政制的宏規。今不平等條約取消，日本帝國主義覆滅，民族主義中「中國民族自求解放」一個目的，巳完全達到，其第二個目的「國內各民族一律平等」，亦可遵奉遣敎及六全大會決議促共澈底實現。尙待迅速策進的，即是最進步的民主政治，最適宜的經濟建設，此爲本黨目前最急的任務，亦爲本黨始終一貫的決心，誓當與我同胞一心一德，再接再厲，使民權主義能在最短期間完全實行，民生主義亦能定期成功。五十年來本黨與全國同胞共同奮鬥，雖已推翻了二百數十年滿淸的統治，結束了五千年的專制，掃蕩了大小軍閥的割據，取消了一百年的不平等條約，打敗了侵略世界的日本帝國主義，但本黨決不因此躊躇滿志。相反的，適與同胞和友邦加深其懲前毖後之念，務使世界的永久和平，獲得確實保障。於民權主義民生主義的最大力量之中，使一切爲民所有，爲民所治，爲民所享，內以安慰我革命先烈與抗戰犧牲的軍民，外以鞏固全人類互利互助共存共榮的基礎。</p>
<p>總裁决策挽救危亡</p>
<p>再次，革命維新興邦建國成功的前提，厥在先知先覺者揆情度理，決志進行。國父旣由此倡率同胞，共成開國之功，本黨總　亦將由此輔導同胞，北成建國之機。九一八前，本黨總裁承負重任，宏濟艱難，固巳爲我同胞所熟知。九一八事變旣起，便鄭重決定禦侮救亡的國策，忍受與論的職責，堅拒敵人的誘　，抱最後犧牲的決心，爲和平最大的努力，並爲抗戰最要的準備。及七七事變一起，便認定這本事變的發展，不僅是中國的存亡問題，亦將是世界人類禍福之所　，立即號召全國，抱定犧牲一切的決心，誓與日本抗戰到底，以爭取最後的勝利。其後首都淪陷，即確定抗戰建國同時並進的國策，進行機動的持久的戰略，粉碎了日本速戰速決與速和速結的企圖，其明效大　，一如粉碎了九一八前日本出兵濟南，阻　北伐的陰謀，與九一八後日本反對國聯顧問的毒計。及德國爆發歐戰，國際形勢詭變，全國危疑震撼，又重申一貫不變的抗戰立塲，並斷定最後的勝利，仍必屬於反侵略的國家。及日本侵略海南島，又立即指出「這是太平洋的九一八，促使友邦警戒，日本旣爆發太平洋戰爭，便命將出師，與盟國並肩作戰，並主張建立世界安全機構。（未完待續）</p>

In the center of the venue, a rectangular table, eight feet long and two feet wide, was placed. Around the table, facing the front, stood the plenipotentiary representatives of China, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, in that order, on the left side. On the right side stood Supreme Allied Commander General MacArthur, the U.S. representative, and approximately sixty U.S. staff members, lined up. At 8:50 a.m., the Japanese plenipotentiary representatives arrived alongside the "Missouri" in a small boat. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Chief of the General Staff Umezu, the two Japanese plenipotentiary representatives, and nine staff members also arrived. At exactly 9:00 a.m., under the chairmanship of General MacArthur, the signing ceremony began. Two copies of the instrument of surrender, one and a half feet long and one foot wide, were placed in the center of the table. The Japanese government's plenipotentiary representatives then stepped into the venue. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and the Naval plenipotentiary representative were at the front, standing in three rows, and after exchanging greetings with the representatives of each country, they followed General MacArthur's instructions. First, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu signed both documents, followed by Chief of the General Staff Umezu. After completion, the Allied side proceeded with signing. The first was Supreme Commander General MacArthur, followed by U.S. Representative Admiral Nimitz, then Chinese Representative General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Operations, British Representative General Frewen, Soviet Representative Lieutenant General Derevyanko, Australian Representative General Blamey, Canadian Representative General Cosgrave, French Representative General Leclerc, Dutch Representative Admiral Helfrich, and New Zealand Representative Air Vice-Marshal Isitt, in that order.

With this, the signing ceremony of the surrender agreement came to an end.</p>
<p>Sketch of the Solemn Ceremony in Twenty-Two Minutes</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from the U.S. battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, 2nd -- Silent Japanese officials, during a solemn and simple ceremony lasting twenty-two minutes, unconditionally surrendered the Japanese Empire to the Allied nations. Under the silent guns of the warship, representatives of the Allied nations quickly signed the instrument of surrender, which had a black cover in Japanese and a gold and green cover in English. As the ceremony smoothly progressed, more than eight hundred Allied warplanes soared up and down in the sky, making a final display of the Allied air power. General MacArthur calmly and solemnly presided over the opening ceremony, giving a short speech. Japanese Representative Shigemitsu Mamoru used a wooden leg to move forward (his leg was injured in the January 28th Incident in Shanghai thirteen years ago). The enemy envoy took a fountain pen from his pocket, looked at one watch, then another watch, and took out his pen. As he was about to sign, he discovered there was no ink. Finally, he signed with a pen borrowed from the U.S. representative. General MacArthur frowned, while Shigemitsu remained expressionless. Then, Japanese Representative Umezu Yoshijiro adjusted his horn-rimmed glasses and stepped forward to quickly sign on behalf of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters. General MacArthur also signed, still wearing the gold-braided peaked cap he wore when returning across the Pacific and landing on the beach. He signed on behalf of all the Allied nations. Representatives from China, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand signed one after another. General MacArthur solemnly stepped to the loudspeaker and declared, "May peace return to the world, and may God keep it always." This ceremony has now concluded.</p>
<p>Japanese Territory Reduced to Four Main Islands as Stipulated</p>
<p>Around 10:00 a.m. today (Tokyo time), Japanese territory, under the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, was reduced to the four main islands and any other small islands that the Allies may allow it to retain. The Japanese People's Government, the Emperor, and industry are now under the rule of General MacArthur, until Japan is allowed to join the world organization planned at the San Francisco Conference. Shigemitsu stood leaning on his cane, stunned. When the ceremony ended, he helped receive the instrument of surrender. The Japanese representatives pointed out a mistake in a line signed by Canadian Representative Cosgrave, which was quickly resolved under consultation between General MacArthur's Chief of Staff and the Japanese representatives. Those monitoring the ceremony were several personnel who had experienced Pearl Harbor, Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Following MacArthur was U.S. Army General Wainwright of the Philippines, British General Percival, the last commander to defend Singapore, U.S. Second Fleet Commander Halsey, General Stilwell, who fought in Burma, and twenty other officials, all of whom participated in the ceremony. When General MacArthur stepped forward to sign, he asked General Wainwright and General Percival, who had been held captive by the Japanese for a long time, "Would you like to step forward and sign with me?" General MacArthur showed a slight hint of excitement. His hand trembled slightly as he held the first of the five pens he used. However, when he began writing the first character, he steadied himself and presented that pen to Wainwright. After using the second pen, he gave it to Percival. He then used the other three pens in turn, quickly completing the signing. These three pens will be given to prominent figures in the Allied nations. Shigemitsu and Umezu left the Missouri approximately half an hour after they boarded the ship. The two bowed goodbye to more than thirty foreign dignitaries, forty senior army officers, fifty naval officers, Allied journalists, photographers, crew members gathered on high places even level with the crow's nest, and 238 released prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Washington, 2nd -- U.S. President Truman, after Japan's formal surrender on the morning of the 2nd, gave a broadcast speech, announcing September 2nd as Victory Day. The gist of the speech is as follows: "From today, we will enter a new century, and we, the United Nations, will jointly enter a new and better world of international cooperation and peace. We were able to achieve this result thanks to the blessings of God. Now, the attempt to destroy world culture has been shattered, but we must never forget the lesson of "Pearl Harbor," and the Japanese military will not forget the "Missouri." The crimes of the Japanese military will forever remain in the minds of the people of the world. They originally intended to conquer all of mankind with their military force, but this attempt has been completely shattered, and their army and navy have now become weak and incompetent instruments. The formal surrender of Japan is not a victory we have achieved solely through weapons; this victory is the victory of freedom over tyranny. As we celebrate this victory, we pay the highest respect to the soldiers who died in the war and to our great leader, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the defender of democracy. From today, we must cooperate closely with other Allied nations to maintain permanent world peace. We still have many difficulties ahead, but we hope to continue our tireless efforts with the courage and endurance of the past four years. Although the burdens and responsibilities that come with victory are heavy, we firmly believe that the United States will be able to unite with its allies to establish a world peace based on justice, equality, and tolerance.</p>

It stated briefly that, on this day when the surrender document is formally signed, when we recall the past, all kinds of feelings converge, and the infinite grief is difficult to express fully. The thought that the armed forces of our long-standing imperial army are about to be disarmed is infinitely painful. Now that the Emperor's edict has been issued, we must obey the formal surrender. Our loyal people should face the fact of defeat and endure its unbearable pain in order to comply with the imperial will. My Japanese people must maintain calm and order, and comply as much as possible with the orders issued by the government and the General Headquarters. We should maintain the enduring spirit of bravery of our nation amidst all kinds of tolerance. My Japanese people should silently reflect on the reasons for the failure of this war, and deeply repent of the past. At the same time, my Japanese people should diligently fulfill all their duties, in order to demonstrate the credibility of the Japanese people to the world. Although there are infinite difficulties weighing on us Japanese, we should approach this situation with unwavering determination. Under the principles of peace and civilization, we should do our best to seek the rebirth of Japan. For the prosperity of our country and efforts for world peace and culture, it is our duty and our responsibility to uphold the Emperor's will.</p>

All of us, victors and vanquished, should jointly display the utmost dignity, and only this dignity can benefit the sacred goal we are about to aim for. All of us should strive to safeguard the work we are about to formally undertake. I deeply hope that people all over the world will share this hope that, from this solemn moment onward, a better world will emerge from the bloodshed and slaughter of the past, based on trust and understanding, striving to maintain human dignity, and realizing the hopes for freedom, tolerance, and justice that we all cherish.

<p>Chongqing, 3rd, 1:00 a.m. -- The National Government issued an order on September 3rd: "Resisting the enemy and teaching a lesson, eight years have passed, and the final victory was not achieved by chance. Recalling from the beginning, all our soldiers, hearing the call of righteousness, rushed to the rescue day and night, using their flesh and blood to face the enemy's advanced weapons. Even when the battlefield was reduced to ashes, the morale of the army remained as strong as metal and stone, advancing one after another, knowing only death and no surrender, knowing only the enemy and not oneself, regarding the eight years as one day. This kind of unwavering and loyal spirit not only terrified the stubborn enemy, but also served as a basis for the Allied nations to respond in unison. Their great achievements will be immortal. Now that the war has ended, and the sun and moon shine brightly again, washing away humiliation and restoring our homeland, at this moment of joy throughout the world and celebration throughout the country, recalling the long years of hard fighting on the battlefields, the Military Affairs Commission is ordered to convey to all officers and soldiers that they will be commended and generously rewarded. As for how to give awards separately according to merit, in order to encourage loyalty and inspire ambition, the Council should consult with the Executive Yuan to quickly draft and finalize the plan and submit it for approval and implementation."</p>
<p>Remembering Loyalty and Bravery, Promoting Righteousness and Valor</p>
<p>Chongqing, 3rd -- The National Government issued an order on the 3rd: "Since the July 7th Incident, we have launched a full-scale war of resistance with the determination to defend ourselves. Fighting to this day, eight years have passed in an instant. Deeply considering the soldiers at the front who have sacrificed themselves for the country, who have chosen righteousness and achieved benevolence, and who have given their lives in the face of danger, one after another, and the local people who share the same hatred of the enemy, whether protecting their homeland and suddenly encountering misfortune, or resisting the enemy's attacks and suffering tragic deaths. Those who did not compromise in the face of adversity and regarded death as a return were also everywhere. Now that the disaster of invasion has been quelled and peace has been restored, reflecting on the loyalty of jointly resisting the enemy, and promoting the praise of those who died for a righteous cause, all officers and soldiers who died in the war of resistance should be investigated by the commanders of each theater of operations, who shall order each army and division to determine their place of origin and their surviving relatives. By October 10th of this year, they are expected to submit details to the Military Affairs Commission for granting condolence money in accordance with regulations. All families of fallen soldiers, disabled officers and soldiers, and each [text missing] share the guarantee of life, specifying regulations for general implementation. As for the compatriots in various regions who died as a result of resisting the enemy, within six months from the date of recovery of the place, the governments of each province, city, and county shall investigate their names and deeds and report them to the Ministry of Interior for separate commendation and consolation, to demonstrate the government's care for loyalty and bravery and promote the ultimate meaning of righteousness and valor."</p>

<p>Chongqing, 3rd, 1:00 a.m. -- The National Government issued an order on September 3rd: "During the War of Resistance, the military took priority. In order to achieve victory and adapt to needs, the government had to promulgate various wartime laws. All aspects of people's lives, economic behavior, and even the freedoms of assembly, association, and speech were inevitably restricted. This was a common practice in all countries during wartime, and it was also an urgent matter for the government to reform in a timely manner. Now that the war has ended, everything should return to normal. All wartime laws promulgated during the War of Resistance should be immediately reviewed and reorganized by the relevant departments, ministries, councils, and bureaus. Those that do not comply with peacetime norms may first apply for repeal, in order to conform to the spirit of the Provisional Constitution and prepare for the implementation of constitutional government."</p>
<h3 id="e10">Letter to the Nation from the Kuomintang: Hoping for Unity to Complete the Great Task of Nation Building <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Kuomintang, for the victory of the War of Resistance, sends a letter to the people of the whole country, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots across the nation! At this moment of victory in the War of Resistance, with the whole country rejoicing, remember the famous saying of the Founding Father: "If a matter accords with the principles of Heaven, responds to human feelings, conforms to the trends of the world, and meets the needs of humanity, and is determined and acted upon by the insightful and the wise, there is absolutely no way it can fail. This is true of all revolutionary renewals, nation-building, and other undertakings throughout history."</p>
<p>The Founding Father's Teachings Resound and Are Answered</p>
<p>This saying, at this victorious moment, feels profoundly fitting. Discussing the future of nation-building, it is even more like a direct command. First and foremost, our party, following the teachings of the Founding Father, led the National Revolution and strived for success in China. Within this success, it has indeed realized the teaching that "even if Japan intends to implement its aggressive policy, the Chinese people will certainly rise up to resist it. Even if China is unfortunately occupied by Japan, no matter when or where, Japan will absolutely not be able to rule it beneficially," and has further realized the teaching that "before the Republic, our party adhered to its principles to establish the Republic; after the Republic, it adheres to its principles to defend the Republic." The Founding Father once pointed out that "our party truly gathers the fate of China's survival; if our party relaxes and does not exert itself, then China may almost cease to exist." Fifty years of revolutionary history and over eight years of War of Resistance records all demonstrate that the efforts and struggles of our party are inextricably linked to China's survival. However, the Founding Father also pointed out that the National Revolution is the affair of the people, and everyone should bear the responsibility of revolution. Our compatriots should remember the Founding Father's teachings from now on, constantly strengthen themselves, and guarantee the success of the great cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>The Three Principles and Five-Power Constitution are the Ultimate Standards for Nation-Building</p>
<p>Secondly, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution established by the Founding Father are the ultimate standards for nation-building and the grand framework for political systems. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished and Japanese imperialism has been overthrown, one goal of nationalism, "the Chinese nation seeking its own liberation," has been completely achieved. The second goal, "equality among all ethnic groups within the country," can also be achieved by following the teachings of the Founding Father and the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress to thoroughly realize communism. What remains to be rapidly promoted is the most progressive democratic politics and the most appropriate economic construction. These are the most urgent tasks for our party at present, and they are also the consistent determination of our party from beginning to end. We pledge to work with our compatriots with one heart and one mind, to redouble our efforts, so that the Principle of Democracy can be fully implemented in the shortest possible time, and the Principle of People's Livelihood can also be successfully achieved on schedule. Over the past fifty years, our party has fought alongside compatriots from across the nation, overthrowing the two-hundred-and-sixty-year rule of the Manchurian Qing, ending five thousand years of autocracy, eliminating the separatism of large and small warlords, abolishing one hundred years of unequal treaties, and defeating the Japanese imperialists who invaded the world. However, our party will never become complacent because of this. On the contrary, we should deepen our reflection on past mistakes with our compatriots and friendly nations, ensuring that lasting world peace is guaranteed. Within the greatest strength of the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, we should ensure that everything is owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, internally to comfort our revolutionary martyrs and the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed in the War of Resistance, and externally to consolidate the foundation of mutual benefit, mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity for all mankind.</p>
<p>The President's Decisions Averted Danger and Saved the Nation</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prerequisite for the success of revolutionary renewals, nation-building, and other undertakings lies in the insightful and the wise, who discern the situation, weigh the rationale, and determine to proceed. The Founding Father led his compatriots in this way, jointly achieving the founding of the nation. Our party's leader will also guide his compatriots in this way, bringing about the opportunity to build the nation. Before the September 18th Incident, our party's leader shouldered heavy responsibilities and overcame great difficulties, which was already well known to our compatriots. When the September 18th Incident occurred, he solemnly decided on the national policy of resisting aggression and saving the nation, enduring the responsibilities of public opinion, firmly rejecting the enemy's temptations, embracing the determination for ultimate sacrifice, making the greatest efforts for peace, and making the most important preparations for the War of Resistance. When the July 7th Incident occurred, he recognized that the development of this incident was not only a matter of China's survival, but also a matter of the world's human fortune, and immediately called on the whole country to embrace the determination to sacrifice everything and vow to resist Japan to the end in order to win the final victory. Later, when the capital fell, he determined the national policy of advancing the War of Resistance and nation-building simultaneously, carried out a mobile and protracted strategy, and shattered Japan's attempts at a quick war and a quick peace, the clear effect of which was as great as shattering Japan's conspiracy to send troops to Jinan before the September 18th Incident to obstruct the Northern Expedition, and Japan's poisonous plan to oppose the League of Nations advisor after the September 18th Incident. When Germany launched the European War and the international situation changed unpredictably, causing nationwide anxiety and shock, he reiterated the consistent and unchanging position of resisting Japan, and determined that the final victory would still belong to the countries resisting aggression. When Japan invaded Hainan Island, he immediately pointed out that "this is the Pacific's September 18th," prompting friendly nations to be vigilant. When Japan launched the Pacific War, he ordered generals to dispatch troops and fight alongside the Allied nations, and advocated the establishment of a world security organization.

<h3 id="e17">Authorities Strive to Maintain Order, All Citizens Must Assist – Interview with Responsible Person from the Military Liaison Office <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Military Liaison Office was officially established on September 1st and has begun operations. Yesterday, a reporter visited the person in charge of the office, inquiring about its establishment and mission. The information provided is as follows:</p>
<p>"This office was established in accordance with the orders of Chiang Bo-cheng, representative of the Chairman stationed in Shanghai, and Wu Shao[blank], the Shanghai military special envoy, to adapt to the current environment in Shanghai, to unify the liaison work of various units stationed in Shanghai, and to maintain public security. It consists of five sections, responsible for staff, adjutant, foreign affairs, liaison, supply, transportation, and military law. A representatives' meeting is held once every day at 11:00 AM, where representatives from various agencies exchange information and discuss important matters. Yesterday, it was decided that if any military agencies or units have illegal actions, the principle is to hand them over to the respective agency for handling. Other units of unknown origin will be handed over to the fifth section (military law) of this office for handling. In major cases, the military police and the Loyalty and Salvation Army Action Brigade will assist in handling. Regarding the issuance of gun licenses, all self-defense firearms of the current police bureau, without the approval of this office, will not be issued. The issuance of gun licenses will still be handled by the current police bureau, but it must be approved by this office. The styles of gun licenses that have been registered and permitted by the two public offices have been notified and sent to the office for reference when carrying out inspection duties. Regarding any units forcibly occupying civilian houses, arresting criminals, or extorting materials, the people can immediately report to the military police or this office, and they will be investigated and dealt with immediately, without any leniency. At this time, when the national army has not yet arrived and local order has not yet been restored, the authorities are determined to do their duty and strive to maintain order. However, this matter is of great importance and requires the assistance of all citizens."</p>

The commander of the Third District is Jiang [blank]fu, who has now started the airfield work in Hangzhou.

<p>The Shanghai Military Police issued a notice yesterday stating: "The mission of this team stationed in Shanghai is to maintain local order and ensure public security. Recently, we have found that some people have sealed off enemy and puppet houses without authorization, which is absolutely wrong. The central government has its own appropriate measures for the handling of enemy and puppet real estate. Before orders are received, any arbitrary actions will violate the meaning of protecting civil rights. Even the houses currently occupied by this team were vacant and unoccupied before being taken over by this team. In addition to assisting various agencies for temporary needs upon request, this team has never sealed off any houses outside. If there are unscrupulous elements who use the name of this team to swindle and seal off houses without authorization, we hope that the citizens will report to this team immediately, and this team will strictly deal with them in accordance with the law."</p>
<p>The Shanghai East Military Police Team Will Be Established</p>

<p>"Dear Allied friends, peace has now been achieved, and this is a day to celebrate the common victory of the Allied nations and our country. I am here on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai to extend my congratulations to you. During the War of Resistance, you and the citizens of Shanghai shared the same boat, enduring all kinds of pain and hardship, which made our relationship closer and our friendship more consolidated. This is something I am deeply pleased about.</p>
<p>Before the Allied nations declared war on Japan, you had already expressed sympathy for our country's War of Resistance and sincerely assisted us. During the Shanghai War, you publicly expressed sympathy for the War of Resistance and generously provided relief and assistance to our wounded soldiers and refugees. This is something we will never forget.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the fall of this city, you gave the people of this city all kinds of cooperation and convenience, which made our spirit of resistance more [blank] and our work of resistance could proceed smoothly. This is also something we cannot forget.</p>
<p>You have always been residents of Shanghai and have made great contributions to the prosperity and development of this city. Now that the war has ended, I sincerely hope that you will continue to cooperate closely and friendly with the people of this city, in the spirit of assistance, to build a new, more prosperous Shanghai for the emerging Republic of China.</p>
<p>All the various difficult problems that you are currently experiencing, I will do my best to assist in resolving them. All matters can be relayed through the leaders of the concentration camp or Major [blank] Yue.</p>
<p>Due to official business, I am unable to visit other concentration camps separately today. I will visit them again on another day to express my condolences. Please convey this message on my behalf. I hope you will accept the few gifts I have prepared."</p>

<p>The Natural Science Institute on the bank of the Fenglin Bridge in this city is a Sino-Japanese joint venture with relatively complete equipment. Since the fall of Shanghai and the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the institute has been managed solely by the Japanese side, but it has been able to maintain a spirit of scientific independence, without any political interference. The puppet organization in Nanjing repeatedly hoped to send people to participate, but they were all rejected by the institute. Since the realization of victory, the Ministry of Education has been very concerned about the current situation of the institute and entrusted Representative Jiang to find ways to protect it. After receiving the telegram, Representative Jiang sent someone to contact the institute. According to the person in charge of the institute, Director Sato, the institute is currently still under the protection of the Japanese army. When the Japanese army withdraws, he will contact our government at any time to request protection. As for the property and instruments, they will all be maintained in good condition, and there is a property directory that can be handed over at any time after the formal receiving agency arrives. After receiving the report, Representative Jiang has telegraphed the Ministry of Education for verification.</p>
