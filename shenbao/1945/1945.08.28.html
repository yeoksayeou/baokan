<p>中央社重慶二十七日電　中蘇友好同盟條約設立法院通過後，中央社記者會訪問孫科院長，惟以時間短促，未得暢談。記者復於二十六日　往訪，孫氏首稱：中蘇友好同盟條約之簽訂，堪稱重蘇外交上之時代的創舉。孫氏繼爲記者述中蘇二十二年來之外交關係後稱，</p>
<p>遠東和平　得保障</p>
<p>此約最大意　，爲　東和平得二保障，防止日木於三十年內絕無再起發動侵略之可能，而此種區域安全制度，乃係在聯合國組織下對遠東和平再加一重保之和平期間，奠定建國之基礎，造成成名符其實之强國，則遠東之和平，得以永久長存。記者　詢以是約成立對國內團結之影響，孫氏以愉快之口吻答稱，是約對促進我國之統一，實有極大的關係。</p>
<p>促進統一建立緩衡　　本人相這今後國內團結問題，必可急轉直下。約中明白規定，蘇聯無論在道義上及實質上對我之援助，均　對我全體盟邦所承認之國民政府發生關係，意謂對於地方政府及中央所未承認之其他政權，不發生關係，而對我國內政，絕不加過問。至於外　問題，我國承認其獨立，無論在事實上及總理民族主義之精神上，均有此必要。外表之獨立狀態，巳達二十五年之歷史，人民生活日在改進，我國實應加以承認，並建立正常外交關係，此一緩衝地帶，中蘇交收其益。至於中東鐵路　旅順等之規定，亦係根據同盟關係，而使蘇聯與中國共同看守日本，使其不能再起，保障遠東和平之永久奠定，專實確有此需要。總之，中蘇條約之訂立，最受打擊者爲日本，今後遠東之和平得以保障，建國之基獲得以奠定，堪稱爲我「遠東近親」之外交政策初步成功。</p>

<p>中央社重慶二十七日電　中蘇友好同盟條約，經國防最高委員會通過後，中央社記者特走訪政治部張部長治中，叩訽其感想。張部長以興奮愉快之情緒談稱：中蘇友好同蘇外交關係步入新階段之開始，且爲安定遠東及維持世界和平之保證。就中國言，對日八年抗戰巳贏得勝利，而與蘇聯締結友好同盟條約，則復贏得和平。中國經此次長期而艱苦之對日抗戰，深知鞏固國際和平秩序，爲完成中國建國工作之基礎，而中蘇友好關係之建立，不但使中國建國工作得以順利推進，且使遠東和平及國際合作，獲得一强固之保障。此不僅爲中蘇兩國所歡迎，且爲全世界愛好和平國軍所歡迎，甚願國人珍重我八年抗戰所獲得之國際地位，珍重我國與同盟國間之　貴友誼，珍重因中蘇友好同盟條約締結面獲得之今後和平建設的順利環境，一德一心，在蔣主席領導之下，從現在開始，準備爲建國工作埋頭苦幹三十年，深信必能逐步完成三民主義新中國之建設，以創造中華民族歷史偉大的光榮的新頁。</p>

<h3 id="c26">爲革命而毀家　彭副秘書長訪問記 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 方澄</p>
<p>歷史上有很多「毀家　難」的故事，也有很多「棄筆從戎」的壯舉，在保守的眼光看來，好像這些故事都是　子所做出的。其實，在當事者的動機，都是發於爲國忘家和捨身取義的熱情，絕無半點僥倖與取巧的心理。而我們　族命脈得以延續，正義得以不　，也就是維　在這班「　子」的身上。</p>
<p>彭公保的文孫</p>
<p>在上海行動總隊司令部的高級人員名單中，很覺生疏的，除了程秘書張以外，還有一位彭濤先生。聽說彭先生是湖南人，他是彭　　的文孫，畢業於香港大學。論家世是書香後裔，又是將門之子。論學歷，則港大爲遠東著名學府，港大的方　曾經多數青年人憧憬過。以這樣的家世與學歷，在常人是足以自豪，而坐享公子哥兒的豔福了。可是，彭先生倒不稀罕這些虛榮，而立志參加革命運動，以至爲革命而毀家破產，爲革命而歷盡人世悲產生活。記者於上次訪問上海行動總隊秘書長程克祥先生時，曾得知他的同志副秘書長兼宣傳處長彭壽先生的片段小史。爲了知道得詳細些，我又作了一次專誠的訪問。</p>
<p>毀家參加革命</p>
<p>在修長的　飛路的西端，到了宣傳處的辦公地點，立刻就會見了彭先生，給我第一個印象便是謙和與瀟洒。坐下後，我首先提出了關於彭先生過去奮鬥經過的問題，他沉思片刻笑　地說了：「這也不過是一個險惡的夢景吧！我從畢業大學後，當時痛感軍閥割據，國勢瀕危，乃立志參加革命，雖經家庭多方權　，卒不稍顧，其後會兩漢重洋往美國求深造，歸國後仍不斷參加革命工作。」這裏表示了彭先生也有「棄筆從戎」和「毀家　難」的壯舉。</p>
<p>一九一八東北事變發生，我的熱血更加沸騰，請准有　當局以人民資格在東北秘密工作很久，把工作的效果，分別獻給有關當局。迨八一三上海事變之初，首先深入敵後，並出沒於敵方前線工作，無日不在槍林彈雨飛機大砲的火綫中過生活，我爲了我的志願，忘卻了一切的危險。其後上海失守，國軍西撤，不得已又往廣州工作，迨廣州失陷，復返上海，後又轉輾　往武漢工作。」</p>
<p>「民廿九年，又復來到上海仍以人民革命者的立場常川往返於京滬之間活動，其後曾飽嘗鐵窗風味，而奮鬥之志益堅，再接再厲以迄於今。但是，我的衡陽長沙和杭州的老家，都已夷爲平地，祗留的祖上遺下的半間祠堂了。」彭先生一口氣追述過去悲壯的歷史，我聽了很爲感動，表示非常欽敬。我復提出這次參加上海行動總隊工作的意見，他說：</p>
<p>「在此日本接受波次坦宣言，國民政府準備接收而國軍尚未到達的過渡期間，上海整個治安的維護，以及整個社會秩序的維持，我們當然有其責任，可是，凡屬上海市民，都應認識其重要性，同時，都應瞭解其責任。我和我的同志，早已獻身志願，祗須符合志願，雖赴湯蹈火亦不能辭，遑論其他犧牲了。況且，我和我的同志參加這次工作，係以人民資格被選用的，並無任何政治關係。」</p>
<p>富有神秘性</p>
<p>談話至此，侍者報有客到，我便與辭。我在歸途中，腦際間印出一個問號：「他和他的同志，是以人民資格參加這次工作的，然而，他身上穿的是將官的軍服，而且又是中央軍隊的服式？也許他是格外謙遜吧！在他的言語動態上看來，又好像是受過嚴格訓練的人物，彭先生眞是神秘極了！</p>
<h3 id="c27">昨日商情 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>昨日銀樓首飾金每兩掛五百萬元，業內外價正午四千七百萬元，外幣美票十萬元，香港票三千元，又六千元，老幣一百三十元，關金二千五百五十元，錢業公會拆息三角，紋銀三萬五千元，銀元二萬一千元。華股塲外做開漸旺，是以股票之跌風稍見定居，各方略有吸收之意，致人心穩堅，成交價俱成堅化。統一公價市況，市勢堅疲互有。米市到源不稀，本街去路平庸行情平定。日用品市勢仍平，捲烟市況回升。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c28">但願如此 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>中蘇友好同盟條約已經簽訂，其中明白規定，蘇聯無論在道義上及實　上對我之援助，均係對我全體盟邦所承認之國民政府發生關係。換言之，對於地方政府及中央所未承認之其他政權不發生關係，而對我國內政，絕對不加過問。</p>
<p>美大使赫爾利於廿七日離渝前往延安，經蔣主席同意，擬陪同毛澤東氏赴渝，與蔣主席商談。因此，國人注目的國內團結問題，將有急轉直下的好轉可能。這是喜訊中的喜訊。</p>
<p>張治中先生說，「中蘇盟約，就中國言，對日八年抗戰已贏得勝利，而對蘇締結友好同盟條約，則復贏得和平。」我們國民但願如此。</p>
<h3 id="c29">「流民」兩年（上） <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 顏弗</p>
<p>我很記得前年七月十七日是我頭一天踏進上海流民習動所得日子。兩天	前我是給××捕房的羅宋巡捕在×××路捉進捕房去的，因那時我穿的衣服　　得很，簡直不　人，捉進流民所是意中的事！</p>
<p>「市民證有沒有？」「嗯…………！」「飛！」的一聲，皮鞭抽將下來！</p>
<p>這樣我就成了囚犯，臂膊被網着在街上兜了一個大圈子，團到捕房時，　我一共捉了六個人。</p>
<p>那羅宋捕提我們到上司面前很恭敬的說：「I　Catch　Dix　Men.　Sir」　　得了六頭野戰般的有功勞！</p>
<p>我們給關進牢房監里面，一會，約晚上九時許，一虎役携清水一桶進牢，吆咤着我們將手洗乾淨，馬上要到公堂打指模，畫口供。</p>
<p>「你幹什麽的？你曾在什麽地方偷東西？快直供出來！」</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>十只指頭都墨黑地在白紙拈起來，我有點茫然　夢。</p>
<p>我很知道我是一個最不振作的人，連自己個人最低限度的生活都不能解決，難怪弄到這般田地。雖然這樣，但我從來沒有埋怨過自己，譴責過自己，因爲我沒有做過對不起自己良心的事。</p>
<p>不兩天功夫，牢里足湊上六七十人了，這堆都是腐物，渣滓，人們最不　的東西，向沒落死亡道上毀減的一　。</p>
<p>十七日早晨，由戴口罩的——　官，醫生，護士，衙役，監視之下，我們便登上帆布篷的車子開走了。</p>
<p>車子跳動　　前進着，因罩着布篷，街上的景物都看不見，想逃走更不可能，天氣　沉風大得很，像嘆息人生的落魄。</p>
<p>車子停下來，那就是上海流民習動所了。白色圍牆環繞一座方城，如像古羅馬的廢墟。</p>
<p>經醫生檢驗，剃頭，洗澡，進所登記，之後，我就是一個不折不扣的流民，我從此生活在流民所里。</p>
<p>巨人之　從自由的世界安排我到道絕緣的土地，只每天夜裏聆聽那秋　唧唧，傾訴生命是多無聊呵。</p>
<p>不久，我曉得此處從前呌「上海遊民習動所」，是拂　家王一亭氏創辦的。事變後已停頓，現由世界紅十字會經辦，改今名爲「上海流民習動所」。改了從前的「遊」字爲「流」字。聽說改這一個是很大的意義。有一次紅十字會某會長來所　演，就說明　「遊」字爲「流」字的意義。他說：「遊」字易爲「流」字，意義很深，大體說來可提高你們的名譽和地位。因爲「遊民」和「流民」就根本不同，「遊」是無業的遊民，是遊手好閒四處遊蕩，貪吃懶做的人，故遊民有點劣性與不良表示；但「流民」就不同，流民是流浪無歸的人，或因爲現時環境關係，爲勞所迫過着流浪生活，不是因爲自己的劣根性而　落的；因此就與那貪吃懶做的「遊民」不同。又「遊」字是無一定目標的，遊來遊去，四處都能遊，四動亂無秩序的現象，「流」字正好相反，比方流水，只有向下流或向上流，這都是有目標的，有了目標就易於改善，比方流民都是趨向下流，股現在我們就要設法改善，這不是比遊民有較好的秩序和目標嗎！</p>

<p>Chongqing, 27th – The National Government issued an order on the 27th, specially appointing Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the plenipotentiary representative to exchange ratifications of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and other related notes, agreements, protocols, and records. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e9">"Befriending the Distant and Neighboring with Kin" Policy Achieves Preliminary Success; Premier Sun Discusses Sino-Soviet Treaty <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – After the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was approved by the Legislative Yuan, a Central News Agency reporter visited Premier Sun Ke, but due to the limited time, a thorough discussion was not possible. The reporter then visited him again on the 26th. Sun first stated: "The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance can be regarded as an epoch-making initiative in Sino-Soviet diplomacy." Sun then described to the reporter the diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union over the past twenty-two years, stating,</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Far East Peace</p>
<p>"The greatest significance of this treaty is that it guarantees peace in the Far East and prevents Japan from launching aggression again within thirty years. This regional security system, under the umbrella of the United Nations, provides an additional layer of protection for peace in the Far East. During this period of peace, we will lay the foundation for national construction and create a truly strong country, so that peace in the Far East can last forever." The reporter inquired about the impact of the treaty on domestic unity. Sun replied with a pleasant tone, "This treaty has a great impact on promoting the unification of our country."</p>
<p>Promoting Unity and Establishing a Buffer Zone</p>
<p>"I believe that the issue of domestic unity will take a sharp turn for the better. The treaty clearly stipulates that the Soviet Union's aid to us, both morally and materially, will only be related to the National Government recognized by all our allies, meaning that it will not be related to local governments or other regimes not recognized by the central government, and will never interfere in our internal affairs. As for the Outer Mongolia issue, our country recognizes its independence, which is necessary both in fact and in the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Outer Mongolia's independent status has been a reality for twenty-five years, and the lives of its people are improving daily. Our country should recognize this and establish normal diplomatic relations. This buffer zone benefits both China and the Soviet Union. As for the provisions regarding the China Eastern Railway and Lushun, they are also based on the alliance relationship, allowing the Soviet Union and China to jointly keep watch over Japan to prevent it from rising again and permanently securing peace in the Far East. This is indeed necessary. In short, the most affected by the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty is Japan. Peace in the Far East can now be guaranteed, and the foundation for national construction can be laid. It can be said that this is a preliminary success of our foreign policy of 'befriending the distant and neighboring with kin'."</p>
<p>Minister Zhang Zhizhong Expresses His Thoughts</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – After the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, a Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Minister of the Political Department Zhang Zhizhong to ask for his thoughts. Minister Zhang spoke with excitement and pleasure, saying: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance marks the beginning of a new stage in Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations and is a guarantee for stabilizing the Far East and maintaining world peace. For China, we have won the victory in the eight-year war against Japan, and by concluding a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, we have also won peace. China, through this long and arduous war of resistance against Japan, deeply understands that consolidating the international order of peace is the foundation for completing China's national construction. The establishment of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union not only enables China's national construction work to proceed smoothly but also provides a solid guarantee for peace in the Far East and international cooperation. This is not only welcomed by China and the Soviet Union but also by peace-loving countries around the world. I sincerely hope that the people of our country will cherish the international status we have gained through eight years of war against Japan, cherish the precious friendship between our country and the Allied countries, and cherish the favorable environment for peaceful construction that we have gained through the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Let us work together with one heart and one mind under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, starting from now, to prepare to work hard for thirty years for national construction. I firmly believe that we will be able to gradually complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People and create a glorious new page in the great history of the Chinese nation."</p>

<p>After Mr. Jiang Gongmei, captain of the special gendarmerie corps stationed in Shanghai, began carrying out his duties a few days ago, the public's mood was greatly inspired. A Daguang News Agency reporter made a special visit to Mr. Jiang at his corps headquarters yesterday. Mr. Jiang received the reporter and revealed that he had been working in the city before the war. After the outbreak of war, he continued his mission in disguise. He was arrested by the enemy puppets three times. Because the environment in Shanghai did not allow him to stay any longer, he hurried back to Chongqing to report his mission and was immediately dispatched to lead the gendarmerie stationed in the vicinity of Shanghai, waiting for the opportunity to advance. After the news of the Japanese surrender was announced, Mr. Jiang led his cadres in disguise, risking passing through obstacles to Shanghai to arrange everything. After the news of the Japanese surrender was confirmed, his armed forces entered the city in full force. Mr. Jiang told the reporter that he wished to cooperate with Mayor Wu, the representative of Chiang, to maintain order in the city. He hoped that all troops stationed in Shanghai would strictly abide by the instructions of the Central Government, the orders of the Chairman, and not deviate in the slightest, holding on to the glorious journey of the past eight years and maintaining the highest honor of soldiers.</p>

<p>Educator Shen Xingong, a pioneer in using Western music to write songs in China, recently composed a Triumphal Song at the request of the expeditionary Indian (missing character) intelligent youth army. To be solemn, he is publicly soliciting musical scores. There is no shortage of famous composers in Shanghai. It is hoped that they will actively submit their contributions (the musical scores should pay attention to grandeur and liveliness) to the Shanghai Office of the Central Propaganda Department, 1105 Taishan Road, or the Central Organization Department Translator's Office, 149 Yuangmingyuan Road. After selection, it will be submitted to the authorities for approval and officially promulgated so that it can be sung during the celebration of victory. The lyrics are as follows:</p>

<p>Joy! Joy! Joy! Sing the Triumphal Song and return home,</p>
<p>See parents, elders, sisters, and brothers again,</p>
<p>Fighting for eight years and traveling ten thousand miles, following the leader and persisting to the end,</p>
<p>Mostly because we are unwilling to let power trample on justice,</p>

<h3 id="e26">Destroying the Home for the Revolution, An Interview with Deputy Secretary-General Peng <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Cheng</p>
<p>Historically, there have been many stories of "destroying the home (to) avert disaster" and many heroic deeds of "abandoning the pen to join the army." From a conservative point of view, it seems that these stories are all made by (missing character) . In fact, the motivation of the parties involved stems from the enthusiasm to forget the family for the sake of the country and to sacrifice oneself for righteousness, without the slightest bit of luck or opportunism. And the reason why our nation's lifeline can be continued and justice can be (missing character) is precisely because of the (missing character) on this group of " (missing character) ".</p>
<p>The Grandson of Peng Gongbao</p>
<p>In the list of senior personnel of the Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters, besides Secretary Cheng and Zhang, who felt very unfamiliar, there was also a Mr. Peng Tao. It is said that Mr. Peng is from Hunan. He is the grandson of Peng (missing character), and graduated from the University of Hong Kong. In terms of family background, he is a descendant of a scholarly family, and also the son of a general. In terms of education, the University of Hong Kong is a famous university in the Far East, and the (missing character) of the University of Hong Kong was once yearned for by most young people. With such a family background and education, it is enough for ordinary people to be proud and enjoy the happiness of a playboy. However, Mr. Peng did not care about these vanities, but was determined to participate in the revolutionary movement, to the point of destroying his family and going bankrupt for the revolution, and experiencing the tragic life of the world for the revolution. During my last interview with Mr. Cheng Kexiang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Action Corps, I learned snippets of the brief history of his comrade, Mr. Peng Shou, Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the Propaganda Department. To know more details, I made a special visit.</p>
<p>Destroying the Home to Join the Revolution</p>
<p>At the western end of the long and (missing character) Feilu Road, reaching the office location of the Propaganda Department, I immediately met Mr. Peng. My first impression of him was humility and elegance. After sitting down, I first raised the question about Mr. Peng's past struggles. He pondered for a moment and said with a smile, "Isn't this just a dangerous dream? After graduating from university, I felt deeply that the warlords were dividing the country and the national situation was on the verge of danger. I was determined to participate in the revolution. Although my family tried to persuade me in many ways, I didn't care at all. Later, I crossed the oceans twice to study in the United States, and after returning to China, I continued to participate in the revolutionary work." This shows that Mr. Peng also had the heroic deeds of "abandoning the pen to join the army" and "destroying the home (to) avert disaster."</p>
<p>"When the Northeast Incident occurred in 1918, my blood boiled even more. With the approval of the relevant authorities, I worked secretly in the Northeast as a common citizen for a long time, and presented the results of my work to the relevant authorities. At the beginning of the August 13th Shanghai Incident, I first penetrated deep behind enemy lines and worked on the enemy's front lines, living every day in a hail of bullets, artillery fire, and airplanes. For my aspirations, I forgot all the dangers. Later, when Shanghai fell and the National Army withdrew westward, I had no choice but to go to work in Guangzhou. When Guangzhou fell, I returned to Shanghai, and then (missing character) went to work in Wuhan."</p>
<p>"In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), I came to Shanghai again and still often traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai as a people's revolutionary. Later, I tasted the flavor of iron windows, but my determination to fight became stronger. I made persistent efforts until today. However, my old homes in Hengyang, Changsha, and Hangzhou have all been razed to the ground, leaving only half of the ancestral temple left by my ancestors." Mr. Peng recounted his tragic history in one breath. I was very moved after listening and expressed my great respect. I then raised my opinion on joining the Shanghai Action Corps this time. He said:</p>
<p>"During this transitional period when Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and the National Government is preparing to take over, but the National Army has not yet arrived, we certainly have the responsibility to maintain the security of Shanghai as a whole and the entire social order. However, all Shanghai citizens should recognize its importance and understand its responsibilities at the same time. My comrades and I have long been dedicated to our aspirations. As long as it conforms to our aspirations, we will not refuse even to go through fire and water, let alone other sacrifices. Moreover, my comrades and I are participating in this work as people who have been selected, and we have no political relationship."</p>
<p>Full of Mystery</p>
<p>At this point in the conversation, the waiter reported that a guest had arrived, so I bid farewell. On my way back, a question mark appeared in my mind: "He and his comrades are participating in this work as people, but he is wearing a general's military uniform, and it is also the style of the central army? Maybe he is particularly modest! From the look of his words and actions, he seems to be a person who has undergone rigorous training. Mr. Peng is really mysterious!</p>
<h3 id="e27">Yesterday's Market Conditions <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold jewelry was listed at 5 million yuan per tael. Inside and outside the industry, the price at noon was 47 million yuan. Foreign currency: US notes, 100,000 yuan; Hong Kong notes, 3,000 yuan, or 6,000 yuan; old currency, 130 yuan; customs gold, 2,550 yuan. The interest rate for interbank lending by the Money Traders Association was 0.3 yuan. Silver was 35,000 yuan, and silver dollars were 21,000 yuan. Off-exchange trading of Chinese stocks gradually became prosperous, so the downward trend of stocks slightly stabilized. Various parties had a slight intention to absorb, resulting in stable confidence and firming transaction prices. The unified public price market was mixed with firmness and weakness. The supply of rice to the market was not scarce, and the demand was average, resulting in stable prices. The market for daily necessities remained stable, and the market for cigarettes rebounded.</p>

<h3 id="e28">I Hope So <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has been signed, which clearly stipulates that the Soviet Union's assistance to us, both morally and practically, is related to the National Government recognized by all our allies. In other words, it does not have any relationship with local governments or other regimes not recognized by the central government, and it will absolutely not interfere in our domestic affairs.</p>
<p>US Ambassador Hurley left Chongqing on the 27th for Yan'an, with the consent of Chairman Chiang, intending to accompany Mao Zedong to Chongqing to discuss with Chairman Chiang. Therefore, the domestic unity issue, which is attracting the attention of the people of the country, may have a sharp and downward turn for the better. This is good news among good news.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhizhong said, "For China, the Sino-Soviet alliance means that we have won the victory in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan. By concluding a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union, we have won peace again." We, the people of the country, hope so.</p>
<h3 id="e29">"Vagrant" for Two Years (Part 1) <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Fu</p>
<p>I remember very well that July 17th of the year before last was the first day I stepped into the Shanghai Vagrant Training Center. Two days before, I was caught by a Russian patrolman from the ×× Police Station on ××× Road. Because the clothes I was wearing were so (missing character), it was simply un(missing character) people. Being caught into the vagrant center was something I expected!</p>
<p>"Do you have a citizen's certificate?" "Um...!" "Whack!" The whip came down!</p>
<p>In this way, I became a prisoner. My arms were netted and I was taken around the street for a big circle. When I reached the police station, a total of six people had been caught with me.</p>
<p>The Russian policeman took us to his superior and said very respectfully, "I Catch Dix Men. Sir." He had captured six wild (missing character), like a meritorious deed!</p>
<p>We were locked up in a prison cell. After a while, around 9 p.m., a prison guard brought a bucket of clean water into the cell, shouting at us to wash our hands clean. We were going to the court to take fingerprints and make statements right away.</p>
<p>"What do you do? Where have you stolen things? Confess quickly!"</p>
<p>"............"</p>
<p>All ten fingers were blackened with ink and pressed on white paper. I was a little dazed, like a dream.</p>
<p>I know very well that I am the most unmotivated person. I can't even solve the minimum living needs for myself. No wonder I ended up in this situation. Even so, I have never complained about myself or condemned myself, because I have never done anything against my conscience.</p>
<p>In less than two days, the prison cell was full of sixty or seventy people. This pile was all rotten stuff, dregs, the things people hate most, a (missing character) dying on the road to ruin.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, under the supervision of masked officials, doctors, nurses, and bailiffs, we boarded a canvas-covered truck and drove away.</p>
<p>The truck was bumping (missing character) forward. Because of the canvas cover, the scenery on the street could not be seen. It was even more impossible to escape. The weather was (missing character) gloomy and very windy, like sighing at the frustration of life.</p>
<p>The truck stopped, and that was the Shanghai Vagrant Training Center. A white wall surrounds a square city, like the ruins of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>After being examined by a doctor, having our heads shaved, taking a bath, and registering at the center, I was an out-and-out vagrant. From then on, I lived in the vagrant center.</p>
<p>The hand of a giant (missing character) arranged for me to go from the free world to a land of isolation, only listening to the autumn (missing character) chirping every night, telling how boring life is.</p>
<p>Soon, I learned that this place used to be called the "Shanghai Tramp Training Center," founded by the (missing character) Wang Yiting. It had been suspended after the incident, and now it was run by the World Red Cross, which changed the name to "Shanghai Vagrant Training Center." It changed the former "tramp" to "vagrant." It is said that changing this one is of great significance. Once a chairman of the Red Cross came to the center to (missing character) speak and explained the meaning of changing the word "tramp" to "vagrant." He said: "Changing the word 'tramp' to 'vagrant' has a profound meaning. Generally speaking, it can improve your reputation and status. Because 'tramp' and 'vagrant' are fundamentally different. 'Tramp' refers to unemployed vagrants, people who are idle and wander around, greedy for food and lazy. Therefore, vagrants have some inferior and bad representations; but 'vagrants' are different. Vagrants are homeless people, or those who are forced to live a vagrant life because of the current environment. It is not because of their own inferiority that they (missing character) fall; therefore, they are different from the greedy and lazy 'tramps.' Also, the word 'tramp' has no definite goal. Tramping around, they can trample everywhere. This is a chaotic and disordered phenomenon. The word 'vagrant' is the opposite. For example, flowing water only flows downwards or upwards. These are all with a goal. Having a goal makes it easier to improve. For example, vagrants are all tending downwards. Now we have to find ways to improve them. Isn't this better organized and has a better goal than tramps?"</p>
