<h3>首都充滿肅穆氣象　紀念　國父逝世　陳代主席率所屬瞻仰遺容</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　國父逝世二十週年紀念（十二日，中樞當局爲緬懷國父生平致力革命之偉大精神與締造民國之艱辛，特於上午九時在國父陵寢陵堂內，舉行隆重紀念典禮，參與人員，文官着國民禮服或藍袍黑掛，佩勳表，武官着軍常服，佩刀佩勳表。八時許陳代主席率領國府各院部會署處長官，各機關高級職員等一萬餘人蒞臨。是時天氣溫暖，春風和暢，靈堂前高縣大國旗，迎風飄蕩，象徴國家民族前程光明復興氣象。九時正，紀念典禮，於軍樂聲中隆重開始，行禮如儀後，由陳代主席獻化圈，繼奏國父逝世紀念歌，旋由陳代主席領導參與紀念典禮人員，繞國父靈寢一週，瞻仰遺容。</p>
<p>祭奠革命先烈默禱日本同志</p>
<p>國父逝世紀念典禮儀式完畢後，並在陳代主席率領下，赴無棵殿，正氣堂，舉行致祭國民革命烈士儀式，祭奠爲國民革命而犧性之烈士，行禮如儀，恭獻花圈後，儀式即吿完畢。旋復至靈谷寺光明殿，舉行默　援助中國革命日本同志儀式，祭奠爲中國革命而犧性之日本同志，全體肅立行一鞠躬後，繼即獻花圈，儀式完畢後，復在陳代主席率領下，全體恭赴梅花山汪故主席墓前致祭，情緒至爲嚴肅，至十時許始畢。</p>
<p>靈寰竟日開放各界紛紛參拜</p>
<p>首都全市十二日一律下半旗誌念，各報均刋載紀念國父文字，各娛樂塲所停止娛樂一日，畫片劇隊亦出動，在各街頭公演國父生前之偉大事蹟，國父靈寢竟日開放，以便各界民衆瞻仰遺容，各機關，團體，學校，民衆，或個別，或結隊前往參拜，自晨至暮，中山路上男女雜沓，絡續不絕，總計前往參拜者達十萬人以上，新街口中心，整刷一新，各界市民均紛至國父銅像前致敬，全市充滿肅穆氣象。</p>
<p>靈穀寺旁植樹陳君慧氏到詞</p>
<p>首都造林運動臨時委員會，十二日在靈穀寺旁國民革命紀念館舉行植樹典禮，十一時半典禮開始，行禮如儀後，首由主席實業部長陳君　氏致開會詞，略述造林意義，後由主席團各委員相繼續演講，最後全體攝影，典禮於是完成。各團體遂於造林委員會領導下，開始赴靈谷寺東側土山植樹，迄下午一時許始畢。</p>
<h3>趙宣傳部長　廣播演詞　破壞統一危害國族</h3>
<p>關於和平統一亟須促成的意義，我曾於一月二十日以「和平統一與自由獨立」爲題，向全國同胞不厭其詳的闡明過了。現在我還要特別提出來申明的，全國同胞不分寗渝，不分和戰，都要覺悟國家的前途祇有一個，民族的命運也祇有一個，臨難不能倖免，有福不能獨享。就如同我們現在都在虔誠的紀念國父一樣，爲什麽我們的脚步，不能一致循著國父遺敎所指示的路綫走呢？難道說我們中國的國家民族的前途與命運，還能有兩個麼？此外，我們又在遍地烟火中，得到了寳貴的敎訓，我們認爲障礙和破壞我們中國統一工作的，就是中國共產黨。中國共產黨的舉動，歷來都是違背國家民族利益的，歷來都是破壞中國的統一與建設的，他們所做與所說的，每每是風馬牛不相及，作盡掛羊頭賣狗肉的勾當，現在就是重慶方面也明瞭這一點。</p>
<p>國共糾紛延未解决</p>
<p>本年三月一日重慶憲政實施促進會上，有這麼一段訓話：「中央與共黨間，始終是一個未解決的懸題，經騐吿訴我們，只要答應其一個要求時，共黨更進而要求容納更多的要求，中央委曲求全，準備與共黨商定合理辦法，但共黨所提出的辦法，完全是爲共黨着想的，如果共黨是爲了國家民族的前途，爲了抗戰的最後勝利，而不是爲爭取政權，那麽對於合理的辦法，是應當接受的。重慶也明白了中國共產黨念念不忘的奪取政權，打倒國民政府，消滅中國國民黨，可惜爲時已遲。我們早已知道共黨所唱的一切高調，都是假的，都是欺騙全世界，以及全國民衆的謊言。我們認定有共產黨存在一日，則中國的統一及民族的復興皆不可能。所以國民政府的和平反共國策，以及「確立治安」「肅正思想」的設施，都是要澈底消滅共黨以救國救民的，都是要使中國對外能以獨立自由，對內能和平統一的。</p>
<p>國父遺教忠誠奉行</p>
<p>我們爲了國家的存亡，民族的復興，對於共產黨要像蝗蟲一樣的把它除掉，所以我希望同胞們不要老老實實的放任共產黨，把自己的身體埋掉，也不要佉懦，聽從共產黨甘言密語的愚弄，要以國家統一的前途爲重，努力剷除共產黨，同時還要撲滅共產黨的邪說。我們知這共產黨目下的田園，只能長草，共產黨筆下的文章就是撒謊。我們今天都在警惕中紀念國父，我們只能忠誠的奉行三民主義，三民主義是我們思想的源泉。全國同胞萬衆一心，上下一致，在陳代席領導之下，「內求和平統」「外求獨立自由」，實現國父遺敎，完成汪故主席遺志，而且我們在今天自責愈嚴，自勵愈凶，國家整個的光明和民族整個的繁榮，也就離我們愈近了。（續完）</p>
<h3>日海軍神風機隊　長驅爭襲烏路西　予敵機動部隊損傷甚大</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地十二日中央社電　日海軍神風特攻隊，十一日晨八時長驅急襲烏路西之敵機動部隊，獲得成功，予敵損傷甚大，關於戰果待查明後即可發表。按烏路西位於西加羅林羣島，爲美機動部隊之前進停靠地。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>粉碎敵美的謀略戰</h3>
<p>菲律賓戰事，拖延已久，迄今且依然僵持未下，渺茫逾昔；敵美想於極短期內便解決菲律賓的打算，顯然已粉碎無遺。</p>
<p>敵美目前在菲律賓尤其呂宋島馬尼刺區，實已陷於進退兩難的境地。進則到處遭受强有力的日軍迎擊，耗損浩大；退則泥足深陷，拯拔殊難。在此種尬尷局面之下，敵美的焦急苦悶，可說無以復加。</p>
<p>正軌的軍事進攻旣無所施其技，爲企圖脫出窘境，於是敵美遂不惜運用種種卑劣狡毒手段，加緊其所謂謀略戰。</p>
<p>誣衊戰軍信譽，是敵美卑劣的謀略戰之一·菲律賓敵軍所到之處，常廬舍爲墟，居民慘遭屠戳，進犯馬尼刺時尤然。敵軍現一方面故意在菲實行燒殺政策，施展殘暴行爲，另一方面却把這些燒殺的罪惡，作虛僞宣傳，諉卸於日軍身上，指係日軍焦土戰略的結果，陰圖挑起菲人對日軍發生惡感，甚至仇恨心理。且不僅企圖煽惑菲律賓人產生錯覺，並圖煽起東亞民族，也懷疑日軍，不滿日軍。</p>
<p>無法打開僵局的敵美，除在情感方面挑煽菲律賓人外，同時更進一步還想利用菲律賓人，驅使菲律賓人做砲灰，跟日本軍隊爲難。菲律賓若干地區近來曾發現敵美誘惑少數無知菲人及土匪流氓，組織所謂遊擊隊，以對抗時常出奇制勝的日軍突擊隊，冀造成東亞人自相殘殺，從中取利，俾達成其侵略野心。</p>
<p>敵美運用造謠，移禍，並想取得菲律賓原住民協力的策略，實則反表現了敵美在戰爭中已失去其本身在軍事上的自信心。强弩之末的趨勢，暴露得非常明白。</p>
<p>東亞民族的團結一致，是敵方所最嫉忌的事；而挑撥離間的手段，乃是敵方的慣技。可是敵方在東亞過去及現在種種觸目驚心的暴行，一貫的侵略行爲，始終昭然若揭，雖欲掩蓋，也料難如願。東亞大多數人早已洞悉敵人的奸謀，目前在日本領導之下，東亞各民族以共死而求同生的信念益堅，團結更趨鞏固，非敵方虛僞宣傳和惡意挑撥所可溶消於萬一。</p>
<p>律賓爲東亞民族的一員，菲律賓人過去在敵美暴虐的統治之下，曾受盡了無限的痛楚，當大東亞戰爭發生，菲人無不勇往直前協助日軍驅逐敵美。接着，菲律賓在日本誠意支援之下，完成了在敵美手中多年鬥爭不得的獨立自由，菲人的感奮可知。現在敵美竟又捲土重來，洞燭敵人奸謀的菲人，自然當竭其所能，跟帮助自己的日軍相與協力作戰，以維護從艱難中得來的獨立。敵美的謀略戰，必然也將隨其軍略的失敗而完全挫折。</p>
<p>中華民族在決戰緊急關頭，同樣也要明察敵人的奸謀。敵人現方打算擴大利用中國大陸作爲戰塲，我們應該從早醒覺，毅然跟日本携手，實現全面和平，在和平區內的人民，則切不可再受敵人誘惑，應在陳代主席領導之下，堅持跟盟邦協力，粉碎敵人的野心。</p>
<h3>仁牙因方面　日軍突擊戰　馬尼剌東方戰事激烈</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　呂宋島之戰况無甚大之變化，惟馬尼刺東方地區及仁牙因兩戰綫，戰事漸趨激烈，七日晚以來，敵軍再度向馬尼刺東方一帶進攻，以蒙達班（馬芝那東北方的十二公里）東方及安保鞭之正面爲目標，十一日安保鞭之戰事益趨激烈，拉古那湖東岸至東方的七公里之摩隆附近，敵軍的四百名，以迫擊砲猛擊，目下敵軍仍在增援中。該方面遊擊隊之行動漸次活潑，仁牙因方面彭坑聖霍塞北方十五公里正面之日軍，繼續向敵軍陣地突擊，十一日在月野少尉之率領下，於聖霍塞北方，擊傷敵兵的五十多名後，復火毀自動貨車二輛，幕舍一，而日軍則全員歸返。聖尼哥拉斯東方，桑特羅查方面，敵軍約五百名携有重溜彈砲，野砲多門，於十一日企圖突破日軍陣地，其行動略形活潑。</p>
<h3>三寶登陸敵日守軍邀擊中</h3>
<p>民答那峨島前綫基地十一日中央社電　在民答那峨島西南端三寳顏登陸之敵，十日以一千五百兵力及戰車三十輛，向飛行塲進攻，日軍守備隊當即邀擊，刻正激戰中。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫十日中央社電　敵軍砲擊民答那峨島西南端三寳顏後，九日上午復以巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦六艘，登陸舟艇十八艘，驅潛艇二艘，敷設艦一艘，出現於三寳顏海面，向飛機塲及海岸方面地帶猛施砲擊。下午三時，卒於三寳顏開始登陸，同時三寳顏對岸巴錫蘭島亦於八日上午九時半開始登陸。</p>
<h3>安南王國　宣言獨立</h3>
<p>順化十一日中央社電　安南二千三百萬民衆，近六十年來受盡法國壓迫，今則民族解放之日已臨，安南王國保大帝，十日召集閣議，就獨立方策作種種協議，十一日正午于勤政殿召集各大臣，發表安南王國獨立宣言，原文如次：安南王國政府，自本日起廢棄法安保護條的，宣言完全恢復獨立安南王國，以期今後之發展及大東亞之共存共榮。安南王國爲完成此項目的，決信賴日本之誠意，舉總力協辦日本帝國。</p>
<h3>西貢全市恢復常態</h3>
<p>西貢十二日中央社電　十一日拂曉，西貢全市已完全恢復常態，街頭巷尾擁滿法人，交通封閉場所除二三重要者外，均已開放，馬東亦照常行駛，市中被拘留之法人，僅爲總督。參軍。司令官等首腦，一般市民與公務人員，毫不受任何拘留。並保障其生命財產。日本此種對待法人之寬恕態度，即法人自身亦深爲驚嘆，以越南首腦部之間推測，日本必出以武力行動，進行種種準備，此甚爲明顯。日本至最後始終由大使採取外交交涉形式，然因越南軍作無謂之抵抗，致不得不釀成發動武力之事件，而對一般法人仍予以極寬大之態度，一般法人對總督及首腦部今次所採之措置，深感遺憾，其中甚有痛斥總督拒絕加强共同防衛之不力者。</p>
<h3>渝方抗戰前途　充滿困難</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）昨（十二）日爲國父孫中山先生逝世二十週年紀念日，聞蔣介石曾發表「吿全國國民書」，其內容充滿重慶抗戰前途備極困難之語意，茲將其大意摘錄兩點於後：</p>
<p>（一）中國於乙酉年起倡導國民革命以來，迄今適爲六十載，茲當六十年之今日，中國已遭逢有史以來之空前困難。</p>
<p>（二）若吾人現在仍存茍且偸安之觀念，則過去無數人民堅苦困難之奮鬥與犧牲，將成爲毫無意味之事。但延安方面之新華社，一面紀念孫先生逝世紀念日，一面則極力批評蔣氏，宜揚孫先生遺志之繼承者，乃中國共產黨而嚴勵攻擊蔣氏獨裁之不合理，並指出蔣乃以中國革命與孫先生之遺囑相背，甚至謂國民黨乃根據其反革命進而欺騙革命，故重演革命與反革命之悲劇，中國前途實已到臨無限黑暗之狀態云。</p>
<p>由此觀之，重慶延安均相互爭取繼續孫先生遺囑之地位，然而雙方均以相反之手段行之，但吾人試觀國民政府於還都南京時發表之宣言中，實屬眞正繼承國父遺志之正統者，和平區內各處均聯合興行紀念議式，基於孫先生之大亞洲主義，中日兩國必須緊密合作，共同邁進，達到新東亞之建設。</p>
<h3>蘇示範防空壕　行破土典禮</h3>
<p>蘇州十二日中央社電　蘇省會成立人民自衛設施委員會，十一日上午十時，在公園內舉行示範防空壕破土典禮，參加民衆踴躍，首由任省長訓詞，語頗誠摯，聞者感動，旋建廳長孫育才報吿辦理經過，人民代表潘子超答詞，全邑各界一致推行，紛起仿築，成效至著。</p>
<h3>德元首申明　繼續抗戰决心　英雄紀念日勗勉將士</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德國社訊：德元首希特勒於星期日英雄紀念日，發表吿將士詞，申言將對共同敵人抗戰，至敵人疲乏崩潰而後巳。其詞大意如次：命運現時雖似不利於吾人，但德人之堅持與勇敢，必將克服種種挫敗，吾已決心不使一九一八年之情形重演，希望吾人皆具有此種意志。敵人已顯明表示欲消除德國民族，際此施行普通軍役十週年紀念之今日，德人祗有一個任務，即決心冒一切危險，以改變局勢是也。其不願實踐此項任務者，吾人亦必須決心消滅之，天助自助者」。</p>
<h3>襲名古屋敵機　墜毀八二架　日制空部隊邀擊戰果</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日大本營十二日下午四時三十分發表：十二日零時頃至二時二十分之間，B29型機約一百三十架，以主力來襲名古屋市，盲炸市街地區，因此熱田神宮發生火災，然本宮別宮等安泰無事。至於市內各處發生之火災，十時許大致撲滅，迄現在所判明之戰果如次，整落敵機二十二架，擊毀約六十架。</p>
<h3>硫黃島北部　展開酷烈戰</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　硫黃島敵軍，自八日夜以來，艦砲射擊逐漸熾烈，其重點集中於北地區之日軍陣地，因之該方面戰鬥自十日以來愈形酷烈，敵軍執抝企圖自日軍北部落陣地之南方，西方兩正面侵入日軍陣地，然經日軍主力部隊猛攻，將其擊退，至十日下午六時許，依然確保陣地繼續奮戰。又十日正午擁有戰車六輛之敵軍的三百，侵入日軍北地區陣地東側之盃島，北部日軍當即予以邀擊，刻正激戰中，玉名山方面之日軍，於八日夜突入玉名山北側之敵陣，與以重創，使之陷於大混亂狀態中。玉名山之日軍仍據守該地，刻在奮戰中。九日僅北部地區之戰果，預料敵軍有八百餘名之損失，擊毀戰車一輛。</p>
<h3>華中振興公司　接管柳泉煤礦</h3>
<p>徐州十二日中央社電　柳泉炭礦決定由華北交付華中振興公司管理後，即準備一切移交手續，於九日上午在該礦公司舉行移交典禮，出席華北開發公司橋本監事，華中振興公司運輸兼總裁及該礦方面常務董事等，至十一時始畢。</p>
<h3>蒙特巴頓　離渝返印</h3>
<p>盤谷十二日中央社電海通社訊：東南亞反軸心軍總司令蒙特巴頓上將，近赴重慶，拜會蔣介石，現已返抵印度。</p>
<h3>耗損龐大的　美空中堡壘</h3>
<p>B29型機大編隊，二月十九日又空襲東京及其周圍，其戰法已有變化，即初向東海地區，突中途折轉，侵入關東地區，由此足證其用心之苦，惟結果所獲仍微，地上的損害極小。由於此種狀况，美國國內正嚷着「B29型是失敗的武器」，使美軍首腦部不得不急求短期決戰，企圖取得轟炸日本本土的中繼根據地，用最近生產量最多的B24型代替B29型，由。B38型等直衛戰鬥機構成强力的護衛隊，以轟炸日本本土，而其進攻硫黃島的目我亦顯然在此。</p>
<p>凡事皆非做到世界第一不可的美國，曾不顧生產方面的各種困難，造成了世界第一的超重轟炸機「空中堡壘」。B29型的性能及大小固屬世界第一，但他們却未注意其消耗之巨亦爲世界第一。</p>
<p>B29型一架的和生產費用，總計七十五萬美元，需材料八十噸，每架所需工作時間二十萬人時，在塞班東京間往返一次，須用汽油七千加侖。美國的預算總額共九百萬萬元，其中用於製造B29型一千四百五十架渚十一萬一千三百七十五萬美元，即B29型的生產費佔其全國總預算的八十分之一以上。襲日總數一千七百架B29型所用的汽油量，共計三萬二千六百噸，佔其汽油年產量八百萬噸的四％。迄今爲止，已損失B29型六百廿九架，所需材料估計爲五千三百二十噸。此項材料大部分爲鋁合金，約佔其鋁產額的五％。B29型的乘員以每架十一人計，則未歸還者已達六千九百十九名，佔美軍空中勤務者總數十萬人的七％。</p>
<p>又美國航空工業從業員總數據稱共二百萬人；所失六百廿九架B29費去的工作時間，計爲二萬萬七百萬小時，平均每日工作九小時的話，即需二千三百萬人時，約當美國全體航空工業從業員二百虧人十一日半的工作。換言之即有二百家擁有工人萬名的航空工廠費了十一天半造成的結晶已經化爲殘骸了。</p>
<p>二月十九日又有B29型一百架的大編隊空襲東京。開戰以前，美國會宣傳只要飛機百架就可以使木屑造成的東京化爲灰燼，然而迄今受到累計一千七百架的超重轟炸機和一千六百架艦上機的轟炸之後，東就是否化爲灰燼呢？事實勝於雄辯。此足表示今日擊墜率已創世界記錄—來製敵機總數的三七％—的日本防空陣綫如何優秀強大。此項擊墜率今後如果越高，則B29型　的月產量便有不足彌補其耗損之虞。同時，乘員葉質的低下，亦屬無可諱言的事實，此由近來美機轟炸的準確率逐漸降低的事實就可明白。由此看，B29型是「失敗的兵器」之諭，確有充分之理由。（譯自二月二十二日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>國父逝世二十週年　全市隆重紀念　昨舉行紀念大會及植樹典禮</h3>
<p>昨（十二）日爲國父逝世二十週年紀念日，本市遵照中央規定，特於上午九時，假大光明電影院，舉行盛大紀念儀式，各界代表參與大會者，頗爲踴躍，周市長特躬親蒞會致詞。會後並舉行造林運動大會，由市宣傳處職員擔任會塲招待幹事。分誌各情如次：</p>
<p>大會盛况　大會計，到長官周市長，羅秘書長，市府所屬各局處長，熊劍東，蘇成德，渡正監，盧英，李時雨，滿其蔚，　繼武，徐季教，袁濬昌，譚庶潛，曁本市各機關團體學校公會等代表一千餘人。主席團爲兼警察局長周佛海，市黨部主任委員劉仰山，社會福利局長周毓英，經濟局長許江，新運會書記長奚培之，市商會理事長袁腹登，中國新聞協會上海區分會理事長陳彬龢，敎育局長戴英夫，宣傳處長劉德煊等。準時舉行儀式，首由市警察局樂隊奏樂行禮如儀畢，由主席團代表劉仰山致詞，報吿紀念國父意義，旋由周市畏致詞畢，由主席團代表領導高呼口號：（一）繼承國父遺志，（二）實現大亞洲主義，（三）勵行造林運動，（四）打倒英美完成大東亞戰爭，（五）復興中華保衛東亞，（六）中華民國萬歲萬萬歲。末奏樂禮成。</p>
<p>主席致詞　主席團代表劉仰山致開會詞：各位長官，各位同志，今天是國父逝世二十週年紀念日，我們回想過去二十年中間，本黨所遭遇的不幸，國民所遭遇的災難，便我們感到悲傷。迨至中日事變開始，中國革命史上遭受到最大的不幸，也就是中國遭受到最大的不幸。到民國二十九年，國府還都開始，可說是中國革命的再出發，到大東亞戰爭的開始，可說是中國革命，用非常正確的方法，走上了非常正確的道路，把英美帝國主義者驅逐出外。現在英美帝國主義者仍在最後掙扎，共產黨還在爲非作歹，使國家的建設，不能順利的進展。所以我們知道英美帝國主義一天不消滅，中國革命就是一天不能成功，今後我們惟有與英美作生死鬥爭，全國一致奮起，協助友邦，共同擊滅英美，以期中國革命之最後成功。再如共產黨一天不剷除，人民即一天不能安寗，也就是革命一天不能成功，所以我們除了協助友邦擊滅英美之外，更要剷除共黨，認淸我們的目標，認淸我們的道路，一致起來，共同奮鬥。</p>
<p>今天又是植樹節，所謂樹人樹木，國家沒有人材，不能進行國事，國家沒有木材，不能推進建設，而且植樹可以調節氣候，防止災難等的利益。</p>
<p>總之，我們要想到英美帝國主義，過種種壓迫，使我們弄到這樣的地步，大家應該澈底醒覺，今天紀念國父逝世二十週年的時候，大家應該特別認識清楚。</p>
<p>我們國家的不幸，大家不必悲觀，我們應該用自己的力量，來挽救我們目前的危機，我們應該有一種自信力，相信在全國領袖及上海的長官領導之下，一定可以達到我們預期的目的，完成革命的使命。</p>
<p>市長致詞　繼由周市長致詞，闡述國父生前革命精神，及逝世遺囑「和平奮鬥救中國」，極爲詳盡，勗勉國人，語意警惕，聽者感奮</p>
<p>植樹典禮　上午十時在外灘公園舉行植樹典禮，植樹式在公園中央舉行，由周市長特派羅秘書長代表參加，園中週團正中爲市長植樹，其下爲秘書長以及各局處長植樹，准時在軍樂鏗鏘中，羅秘書長領導所屬各局處長及主席團代表等行植樹式，羅秘書長親執籬刀揮土，即將楊樹安植後，儀式遂吿完成。當時並由中華電影公司將植樹典禮情形，攝成影片，以留紀念。</p>

<h3>越南原住民　建立獨立基礎　松平部長談越南事件</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，松平報這部長對最近越南事件，發表感想如次：</p>
<p>日帝國政府對南採獨力防衛措置，其最小限度乃在排除敵性官憲，在滬上亦因必要而解除法國軍警武裝。此項措置，似對於世界各處不無若干衝動，但帝國政府所發表之聲明中，已明白表示由於法官憲之違反共同防衛協定，逐漸變更態度，不守信義，而不願共同協力，故軍事上乃不得已而採取此項措置。至對於越南原住民，則帝國政府聲明中，曾謂保衛鄉土，對原住民絕對援助。</p>
<p>越南久處於法國壓迫之下，其民族久已希望於大東亞宣言旨之下，實現獨立，是以帝國政府之聲明，實具有重大意養在也。越南係指安南·東京·交趾又那。東埔寨及老撾諸地而稱，其中交趾支那爲純粹之法國殖民地，安南東京在保護條約之下，東埔寨由安南王與法訂的，老撾由各酋長個別與法訂的，均爲法國之保護領。在最近之一百三十餘年中，糾紛時起，淸朝時安南王曾請求中國協助，淸軍與法交戰，於法人武力之下屈服至今。</p>
<p>松平部長最後謂當余在粵時，曾晤安南獨立運動領袖令澤民表示，亟欲恢復安南之地位，今日此獨立遝動派，當可更有希望。獨立之基礎旣已確定，自可達到實現其理想之目的矣。</p>

<h3>The Capital Filled With a Solemn Atmosphere: Commemorating the Passing of the Founding Father; Acting Chairman Chen Leads His Subordinates in Paying Respects to His Remains</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The twentieth anniversary of the passing of the Founding Father (The central authorities, on the 12th, in order to commemorate the great spirit of the Founding Father's lifelong dedication to revolution and the hardship of establishing the Republic of China, specially held a grand memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM in the mausoleum of the Founding Father. Participating personnel: civil officials wore national formal attire or blue robes with black mandarin jackets, adorned with medals; military officials wore military regular attire, with swords and medals. Around 8:00 AM, Acting Chairman Chen led over 10,000 people, including the heads of the various Yuan, ministries, commissions, departments, and offices of the National Government, as well as senior officials from various agencies, in attendance. The weather at the time was warm, and the spring breeze was gentle. A large national flag was hung high in front of the mausoleum, fluttering in the wind, symbolizing the bright future and revival of the nation. At exactly 9:00 AM, the memorial ceremony solemnly began amidst military music. After the formalities were observed, Acting Chairman Chen presented a flower wreath, followed by the playing of the "Founding Father's Death Anniversary Song." Subsequently, Acting Chairman Chen led the participants in the memorial ceremony in circling the Founding Father's mausoleum once, paying respects to his remains.</p>
<p>Sacrificing to Revolutionary Martyrs and Silently Praying for Japanese Comrades</p>

<h3>Minister Zhao Promulgates Broadcast Speech: Destroying Unity Endangers the Nation</h3>
<p>Regarding the significance of urgently promoting peaceful unification, I have already exhaustively explained it to the compatriots nationwide on January 20th with the title "Peaceful Unification and Freedom and Independence." Now, I want to especially bring it up again to declare that all compatriots nationwide, regardless of whether they are in Nanjing or Chongqing, regardless of whether they advocate peace or war, must realize that the nation's future is only one, and the fate of the nation is only one. We cannot avoid disaster together, and we cannot enjoy blessings alone. Just like we are now piously commemorating the Founding Father, why can't our footsteps uniformly follow the path indicated by the Founding Father's teachings? Could it be said that our Chinese nation's future and destiny can have two? Furthermore, we have gained valuable lessons from the flames of war everywhere. We believe that the obstacle and destroyer of our Chinese unification work is the Chinese Communist Party. The actions of the Chinese Communist Party have always been contrary to the interests of the nation, and have always been destructive to China's unification and construction. What they do and what they say are often completely unrelated, engaging in the trickery of selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton. Now, even Chongqing understands this point.</p>
<p>The Dispute Between the Kuomintang and the Communists Has Remained Unresolved</p>
<p>On March 1st of this year, at the Chongqing Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, there was such a remark: "The issue between the Central Government and the Communist Party has always been an unresolved question. Experience tells us that as long as one demand is agreed to, the Communist Party will further demand the acceptance of more demands. The Central Government makes compromises, preparing to negotiate a reasonable solution with the Communist Party, but the solutions proposed by the Communist Party are entirely for the Communist Party's sake. If the Communist Party is for the sake of the nation's future, for the final victory of the War of Resistance, and not for seizing power, then reasonable solutions should be accepted." Chongqing also understands that the Chinese Communist Party is constantly thinking about seizing power, overthrowing the National Government, and eliminating the Chinese Kuomintang, but it is too late. We have long known that all the high-sounding words sung by the Communist Party are false, all lies to deceive the whole world and the people nationwide. We believe that as long as the Communist Party exists for one day, the unification of China and the revival of the nation are impossible. Therefore, the National Government's peaceful anti-communist national policy, as well as the "establishment of public security" and "rectification of thought" measures, are all to thoroughly eliminate the Communist Party to save the nation and the people, and are all to enable China to be independent and free externally, and peacefully unified internally.</p>
<p>Loyally Following the Founding Father's Teachings</p>
<p>For the sake of the nation's survival and the nation's revival, we must eliminate the Communist Party like locusts. Therefore, I hope that compatriots will not honestly let the Communist Party bury themselves, nor be cowardly and listen to the Communist Party's sweet words and honeyed phrases. We must prioritize the future of national unification, strive to eliminate the Communist Party, and at the same time extinguish the Communist Party's heresies. We know that the Communist Party's current fields can only grow weeds, and the articles written by the Communist Party are lies. Today, we are commemorating the Founding Father with vigilance. We can only loyally follow the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People are the source of our thought. Compatriots nationwide, with one heart and one mind, united from top to bottom, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, "seek peaceful unification internally" and "seek independent freedom externally," realize the Founding Father's teachings, complete the late Chairman Wang's legacy, and the more severely we reproach ourselves today, and the more fiercely we encourage ourselves, the closer the entire light of the nation and the entire prosperity of the nation will be to us.

<h3>Crushing the Enemy's Scheming Warfare</h3>
<p>The battle in the Philippines has been dragging on for a long time, and it remains deadlocked as before. The enemy's plan to resolve the Philippines in a very short period of time has clearly been completely crushed.</p>
<p>The enemy is currently in the Philippines, especially in the Manila area of Luzon, in a dilemma. Advancing, they are met with strong Japanese resistance everywhere, resulting in great losses; retreating, they are mired in deep mud, making extrication difficult. Under these awkward circumstances, the enemy's anxiety and distress can be said to be unparalleled.</p>
<p>With the orthodox military offensive unable to be used, in an attempt to escape their predicament, the enemy has not hesitated to use all kinds of despicable and cunning means to intensify their so-called scheming warfare.</p>
<p>Slandering the reputation of the military is one of the enemy's despicable scheming tactics. Wherever the enemy troops in the Philippines go, they often turn homes into ruins and residents are brutally massacred, especially when attacking Manila. The enemy is now deliberately implementing a scorched-earth policy in the Philippines, displaying barbaric behavior. On the other hand, they are making false propaganda about these acts of burning and killing, shifting the blame to the Japanese army, claiming that it is the result of the Japanese army's scorched-earth strategy, and secretly trying to provoke the Filipinos to develop resentment and even hatred towards the Japanese army. They not only attempt to incite illusions among the Filipinos, but also attempt to incite other East Asian nations to doubt and be dissatisfied with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The enemy, unable to break the deadlock, in addition to emotionally inciting the Filipinos, also wants to further exploit the Filipinos, driving them to become cannon fodder and make trouble for the Japanese army. In some areas of the Philippines, the enemy has recently been found to be enticing a small number of ignorant Filipinos and bandits to organize so-called guerrilla groups to confront the often surprisingly victorious Japanese commando units, hoping to create a situation where East Asians kill each other, so as to profit from it and achieve their aggressive ambitions.</p>
<p>The enemy's strategy of using rumors, shifting blame, and trying to gain the cooperation of the indigenous Filipinos actually demonstrates that the enemy has lost its own military confidence in the war. The trend of a spent arrow is exposed very clearly.</p>
<p>The unity of the East Asian nations is what the enemy is most jealous of; and the means of sowing discord is the enemy's customary trick. However, the various shocking atrocities and consistent acts of aggression committed by the enemy in East Asia in the past and present have always been clearly revealed, and even if they try to cover them up, it is expected to be difficult to succeed. Most people in East Asia have long seen through the enemy's conspiracy. Currently, under the leadership of Japan, the East Asian nations' belief in common death and the pursuit of common life is becoming stronger, and unity is becoming more consolidated, which cannot be dissolved by the enemy's false propaganda and malicious incitement in the slightest.</p>
<p>The Philippines is a member of the East Asian nations. In the past, under the brutal rule of the enemy, the Filipinos suffered endless pain. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Filipinos bravely stepped forward to help the Japanese army drive out the enemy. Subsequently, with Japan's sincere support, the Philippines achieved the independence and freedom that it had struggled for for many years in the hands of the enemy, and the Filipinos' excitement is well known. Now that the enemy has returned, the Filipinos, who have insight into the enemy's conspiracy, will naturally do their best to cooperate with the Japanese army, who is helping them, to defend the independence they have gained through hardship. The enemy's scheming warfare will inevitably be completely frustrated along with the failure of their military strategy.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation, at the critical juncture of the decisive battle, must also clearly understand the enemy's conspiracy. The enemy is now planning to expand the use of mainland China as a battlefield. We should wake up early, resolutely join hands with Japan to achieve overall peace, and the people in the peace zone must not be seduced by the enemy again. Under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, we should persist in cooperating with the allied nations to crush the enemy's ambitions.</p>
<h3>In the Area of Lingayen; Japanese Army Commando Warfare; Fierce Fighting East of Manila</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - There is no major change in the war situation on Luzon Island. However, the fighting is gradually intensifying on the two front lines of the eastern area of Manila and Lingayen. Since the evening of the 7th, the enemy forces have once again launched an attack towards the east of Manila, targeting the east of Montalban (12 kilometers northeast of Majayjay) and the front of Antipolo. On the 11th, the fighting in Antipolo became increasingly fierce. Near Morong, 7 kilometers east of the east coast of Laguna de Bay, 400 enemy troops fiercely bombarded with mortars. The enemy troops are still reinforcing. The actions of the guerrilla forces in that area are gradually becoming more active. On the Lingayen front, the Japanese army, 15 kilometers north of San Jose, continued to launch commando attacks on the enemy's positions. On the 11th, under the leadership of Lieutenant Ono, they injured more than 50 enemy soldiers north of San Jose, and destroyed two automatic trucks and one barrack, and the entire Japanese army returned safely. East of San Nicolas, in the direction of Santa Rosa, about 500 enemy troops, carrying heavy grenade launchers and many field guns, attempted to break through the Japanese army's positions on the 11th, and their actions were slightly active.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landing in Zamboanga Met With Japanese Defenders' Attack</h3>
<p>Mindanao Island Frontline Base, 11th (Central News Agency) - The enemy that landed in Zamboanga at the southwestern tip of Mindanao Island, on the 10th, used 1,500 troops and 30 tanks to attack the airfield. The Japanese garrison immediately launched an attack, and fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the enemy forces shelled Zamboanga at the southwestern tip of Mindanao Island, on the morning of the 9th, two cruisers, six destroyers, eighteen landing boats, two submarine chasers, and one minelayer appeared on the sea off Zamboanga, and fiercely shelled the airfield and coastal areas. At 3:00 PM, they finally began landing in Zamboanga. At the same time, Basilan Island, opposite Zamboanga, also began landing at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 8th.</p>
<h3>The Kingdom of Annam; Declares Independence</h3>
<p>Hue, 11th (Central News Agency) - The 23 million people of Annam have suffered French oppression for nearly 60 years, and now the day of national liberation has arrived. Emperor Bao Dai of the Kingdom of Annam convened a cabinet meeting on the 10th to discuss various independence strategies. At noon on the 11th, he convened all the ministers in the Can Chanh Palace and issued the Declaration of Independence of the Kingdom of Annam, the original text of which is as follows: "The government of the Kingdom of Annam, from this day forward, abolishes the French-Annam Protectorate Treaty and declares the complete restoration of the independent Kingdom of Annam, in order to achieve future development and the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. In order to achieve this goal, the Kingdom of Annam is determined to trust Japan's sincerity and exert all its strength to assist the Japanese Empire."</p>
<h3>Saigon Entirely Returns to Normalcy</h3>
<p>Saigon, 12th (Central News Agency) - On the dawn of the 11th, Saigon had completely returned to normalcy. The streets and alleys were crowded with French people. All closed transportation areas, except for a few important ones, have been opened. The Madong trams are also running as usual. Among the French people detained in the city, only the governor-general, the military attache, and the commander are the leading figures. The general public and civil servants are not subject to any detention and their lives and property are guaranteed. The Japanese's tolerant attitude towards the French deeply surprised the French themselves. It was very clear that the Vietnamese leadership suspected that Japan would take military action and made various preparations. Japan, to the end, always adopted a diplomatic negotiation approach through its ambassador. However, due to the Vietnamese army's senseless resistance, it had no choice but to lead to the incident of military action. However, it still treated the general French population with extreme leniency. The general French population deeply regretted the measures taken by the governor-general and the leadership this time, and some even severely criticized the governor-general's lack of effort in refusing to strengthen joint defense.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Prospects for the War of Resistance; Filled With Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) - Yesterday (the 12th) was the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen. It is heard that Chiang Kai-shek issued a "Letter to the People of the Whole Country," the content of which was filled with the implication that Chongqing's prospects for the War of Resistance were extremely difficult. Two points of its general meaning are extracted below:</p>
<p>(1) Since China initiated the National Revolution in the year of Yiyou, it has now been sixty years. Today, on this day of the sixtieth year, China has encountered unprecedented difficulties in its history.</p>
<p>(2) If we still harbor the concept of seeking temporary ease and security, then the countless people's arduous struggles and sacrifices in the past will become meaningless. However, the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency, while commemorating the anniversary of Mr. Sun's death, vehemently criticized Chiang Kai-shek, declaring that the successor to Mr. Sun's legacy is the Chinese Communist Party, and severely attacking Chiang's unreasonable dictatorship, and pointed out that Chiang's actions are contrary to the Chinese revolution and Mr. Sun's will. It even said that the Kuomintang is based on its counter-revolution to deceive the revolution, so it is re-enacting the tragedy of revolution and counter-revolution, and China's future has reached a state of infinite darkness.</p>
<p>From this perspective, both Chongqing and Yan'an are vying to continue Mr. Sun's legacy, but both sides are doing so with opposite means. However, if we examine the declaration issued by the National Government when it returned to Nanjing, it is truly the orthodox successor to the Founding Father's legacy. Memorial ceremonies are being jointly held throughout the peace zone. Based on Mr. Sun's Pan-Asianism, China and Japan must cooperate closely and advance together to achieve the construction of a New East Asia.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Model Air-Raid Shelter; Groundbreaking Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Suzhou Provincial People's Self-Defense Facilities Committee was established, and at 10:00 AM on the 11th, a groundbreaking ceremony for a model air-raid shelter was held in the park. The people participating were enthusiastic. First, Governor Ren gave a speech, the words of which were quite sincere, and the listeners were moved. Then, Director Sun Yucai of the Construction Department reported on the process. Pan Zichao, a representative of the people, gave a reply. All sectors of the city unanimously promoted it, and people started to imitate and build them, with remarkable results.</p>
<h3>German Head of State Declares; Determination to Continue the War of Resistance; Encouraging Soldiers on Heroes' Memorial Day</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency report: German Head of State Hitler, on Sunday's Heroes' Memorial Day, issued a message to the soldiers, declaring that they would fight against the common enemy until the enemy was exhausted and collapsed. The gist of his message is as follows: "Although fate may seem unfavorable to us at this time, the perseverance and courage of the German people will surely overcome various setbacks. I am determined not to let the situation of 1918 repeat itself, and I hope that we all have this will. The enemy has clearly expressed its desire to eliminate the German nation. Today, on the tenth anniversary of the implementation of universal military service, the German people have only one task, that is, to be determined to risk all dangers to change the situation. Those who are unwilling to fulfill this task, we must also be determined to eliminate. Heaven helps those who help themselves."</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacking Nagoya; 82 Crashed; Japanese Air Force's Battle Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 12th: "From around 0:00 to 2:20 on the 12th, about 130 B-29 aircraft, with their main force, attacked Nagoya City, blindly bombing the urban area. As a result, a fire broke out at Atsuta Shrine, but the main shrine and the detached shrines are safe and sound. As for the fires that broke out in various parts of the city, they were generally extinguished around 10:00 AM. The results of the battle that have been confirmed so far are as follows: 22 enemy planes were shot down, and about 60 were destroyed."</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Northern Iwo Jima</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Since the night of the 8th, the enemy forces on Iwo Jima have gradually intensified their naval gun bombardment, with the focus concentrated on the Japanese army's positions in the northern area. As a result, the battle in that area has become increasingly fierce since the 10th. The enemy forces are stubbornly attempting to invade the Japanese army's positions from the south and west fronts of the Japanese army's northern strongholds. However, after a fierce attack by the main force of the Japanese army, they were repelled. As of around 6:00 PM on the 10th, they were still securing their positions and continuing to fight hard. Furthermore, at noon on the 10th, 300 enemy troops with six tanks invaded Kojima, east of the Japanese army's positions in the northern area. The Japanese army in the north immediately launched an attack, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The Japanese army on Mount Suribachi broke into the enemy's position north of Mount Suribachi on the night of the 8th and inflicted heavy damage on them, causing them to fall into a state of great chaos. The Japanese army on Mount Suribachi is still holding its ground and fighting hard. The battle results in the northern area alone on the 9th are estimated to have resulted in the loss of more than 800 enemy troops and the destruction of one tank.</p>

<h3>Mountbatten Leaves Chongqing to Return to India</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 12th (Central News Agency, Haito News Agency) - General Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, recently went to Chongqing to visit Chiang Kai-shek and has now returned to India.</p>
<h3>The Huge Cost of American Flying Fortresses</h3>
<p>Large formations of B29 aircraft again bombed Tokyo and its surroundings on February 19th. Their tactics have changed, initially heading towards the East China Sea, then abruptly turning mid-course to invade the Kanto region, which proves their painstaking efforts. However, the results obtained are still minimal, with very little damage on the ground. Due to this situation, the United States is clamoring that "the B29 is a failed weapon," forcing the US military leaders to urgently seek a short-term decisive battle, attempting to acquire an intermediate base for bombing the Japanese mainland. They plan to replace the B29 with the B24, which has the highest production volume recently, and form a strong escort team with B38 and other direct escort fighters to bomb the Japanese mainland. Their objective in attacking Iwo Jima is also obvious.</p>
<p>The United States, which insists on being the best in the world in everything, has disregarded various production difficulties and created the world's first super-heavy bomber, the "Flying Fortress." While the performance and size of the B29 are indeed world-class, they have not paid attention to its enormous consumption, which is also world-class.</p>
<p>The total production cost of a single B29 is $750,000, requiring 80 tons of materials and 200,000 man-hours. Each round trip between Saipan and Tokyo requires 7,000 gallons of gasoline. The total US budget is $900 billion, of which $1,450 B29s cost $111.375 billion, meaning that the production cost of the B29 accounts for more than one-eightieth of the country's total budget. The total gasoline consumption for 1,700 B29s attacking Japan is 32,600 tons, accounting for 4% of its annual gasoline production of 8 million tons. To date, 629 B29s have been lost, and the estimated material required is 5,320 tons. Most of this material is aluminum alloy, accounting for about 5% of its aluminum production. With 11 crew members per B29, the number of unreturned personnel has reached 6,919, accounting for 7% of the total number of 100,000 US air service personnel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total number of employees in the US aviation industry is said to be 2 million. The working hours lost for the 629 B29s amount to 200.7 million hours. Assuming an average of 9 hours of work per day, this requires 23 million man-days, approximately equivalent to the work of all 2 million employees in the US aviation industry for 11 and a half days. In other words, the crystallization of 200 aviation factories, each with 10,000 workers, for 11 and a half days has been turned into wreckage.</p>
<p>On February 19th, a large formation of 100 B29s again bombed Tokyo. Before the war, the United States claimed that just 100 aircraft could turn Tokyo, made of wood chips, into ashes. However, after being bombed by a cumulative total of 1,700 super-heavy bombers and 1,600 carrier-based aircraft, has Tokyo been reduced to ashes? Facts speak louder than words. This fully demonstrates how excellent and powerful the Japanese air defense line is, which has created a world record for the rate of enemy aircraft shot down – 37% of the total number. If this rate of destruction continues to increase, the monthly production of the B29 may not be sufficient to compensate for its losses. At the same time, the decline in crew quality is also an undeniable fact, as can be seen from the recent gradual decrease in the accuracy of US aircraft bombing. From this perspective, the argument that the B29 is a "failed weapon" is indeed well-founded. (Translated from the February 22nd issue of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Intensified Battle Situation on the Irrawaddy River Line – Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Counterattacks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Burmese Front, 12th: The battle situation on the Irrawaddy River front is intensifying as the dry season approaches. Japanese forces are launching fierce counterattacks against the British-Indian 7th Division. According to reports from various sources, the battle situation there is as follows: (1) On the right flank, in the plains southeast of New Yegu on the Irrawaddy River, the main force of the enemy's 19th Division is again invading the right bank of the Irrawaddy, echoing the New Yegu forces, attempting to gradually close in on the Japanese positions. The battle situation has clearly intensified since the day before yesterday. Furthermore, the enemy forces advancing south of Wacheng from the 3rd, possessing powerful tanks and artillery, launched a large-scale offensive, but the Japanese forces fought bravely with a small force and crushed the enemy's attempt. (2) In the central sector, the British forces invading the Sagaing-Yinmabin line have suffered over 5,000 casualties from intense Japanese artillery fire. The center of the fierce fighting remains around Nanzi. The enemy forces, with several tanks, are attempting to probe the Japanese positions. The Japanese forces are counterattacking from the southeast, west, and three sides to prevent the enemy's advance. Therefore, the enemy is also attempting to expand the bridgehead on the south bank but has encountered Japanese counterattacks, and the enemy's progress is extremely slow. (3) On the left flank, the enemy's attacks from the intersection of the Kothaung and Irrawaddy rivers to the Mingun area have slowed down since this month. There have been no major changes on that front. However, the enemy forces crossing the river from Nyaung-u are facing continuous and fierce counterattacks from the Japanese forces. As the enemy forces continue to concentrate their forces from Nyaung-u, attempting to desperately break through the Meiktila Highway, the Japanese forces are repeatedly counterattacking and are pressing westward.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Establishes Local Product and Material Management Committee</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: In order to increase the production of local products, facilitate transportation and sales, regulate the economy, and revive the market, the Zhejiang Provincial authorities have established the Zhejiang Provincial Local Product and Material Management Committee. Management offices have been set up under the committee and have been officially established and have begun operations.

Notices have been sent to the Japanese military and police authorities in various areas of the province, and application forms for business registration, movement permits, application methods, and valuation of various materials have been issued to the industry associations to be forwarded to their member businesses for compliance. Hereafter, the operation of the above-mentioned local products and materials must be registered in accordance with the regulations, and movement permits must be obtained. At the same time, a management fee of 10% must be paid according to the valuation before they can be moved; otherwise, they will be banned.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Elections in Three Provinces and Two Cities to be Completed by Deadline</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: In order to strengthen party affairs and consolidate the party base, the Kuomintang has decided to restore the election system for party headquarters at all levels. The Standing Committee passed the "Outline for the Election of Party Headquarters at All Levels Below Provincial and Municipal Special Municipalities" at its 98th meeting. Except for the provinces and cities in the north, which will be handled separately, the party headquarters in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, must complete the elections of party headquarters in all counties and districts (urban areas) before May 15th of this year. The three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and the city of Hankou, must complete the elections within two months of receiving the notice. Furthermore, the election methods for special party headquarters in the military, navy, and railways are the same as those for county and district party branches.</p>
<h3>Major Decisive Battle Unfolds on the East Bank of the Rhine River</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 12th: According to reports from embedded reporters with the Associated Press, the German army will launch a large-scale counteroffensive against the anti-Axis bridgehead on the opposite bank of Remagen. German reinforcements are arriving one after another, and a major decisive battle is unfolding.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th: According to reports from Haitong News Agency, enemy artillery fire can still be heard in Weisgniaret and the Eifel region. However, the area that should be paid attention to is still around Linzi City, between Honnef and Honningen. The enemy continues to cross the Rhine River and send reinforcements, and the enemy still holds bridgeheads in Niterbersich, Bairul, and Antenach. Between Koblenz and Trier, the enemy continues to exert heavy pressure towards the Moselle region. General Blatherley's forces have advanced to Kagen in the Moselle River basin but have not been able to cross the river.</p>
<h3>In West Prussia, Germany Shortens the Line of Defense; Soviet Forces Invade Danzig Amidst Wind and Snow</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th: According to Haitong News Agency, Soviet forces, with five divisions, launched a new offensive between Schwazenwalde and Pilitz, attempting to break into the Moravian Plain. Their repeated attacks on Marienwerder were all blocked by the German defenders. On the northern flank of the Eastern Front, Stettin and Danzig-Gotenhafen remain the focus of the Soviet offensive. Although Marshal Zhukov attacked the Stettin bridgehead with large tanks, he has not yet reached Altdamm. The German army has shortened its defensive line in Danzig Harbor and Gotenhafen in West Prussia and has thwarted the enemy's attempt to split the German front line.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th: According to front-line reports, Soviet troops entered the southern suburbs of the Free City of Danzig on the 10th and launched street battles in severe wind and snow. The left wing of the army also began operations from Kalisch-Kielgar, 26 kilometers west of the Free City of Danzig, and attacked the port of Kuggenia. It now appears that they have broken into the northeastern part of the port. The Danzig Corridor front has become unusually tense.</p>

<h3>Solemn Commemoration of the 20th Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father; City Holds Grand Memorial Ceremony and Tree Planting Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (12th) was the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father. In accordance with the central government's regulations, the city held a grand memorial ceremony at the Grand Bright Cinema at 9:00 AM. Representatives from all walks of life actively participated in the conference. Mayor Zhou personally attended the meeting to deliver a speech. After the meeting, a afforestation rally was held. Officials from the Municipal Propaganda Office served as reception staff at the venue. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Conference Scene: Attendees included Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, heads of various bureaus and departments under the municipal government, Xiong Jiandong, Su Chengde, Watanabe Tadashi, Lu Ying, Li Shiyu, Man Qiwei, Ji Wu, Xu Jijiao, Yuan Junchang, Tan Shujian, and more than 1,000 representatives from various agencies, organizations, schools, and trade associations in the city. The presidium members included Zhou Fohai, concurrently the Director of the Police Bureau; Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Zhou Yuying, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau; Xu Jiang, Director of the Economic Bureau; Xi Peizhi, Secretary-General of the New Movement Association; Yuan Fudeng, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China Journalists Association; Dai Yingfu, Director of the Education Bureau; and Liu Dexuan, Director of the Propaganda Office. The ceremony began punctually. The police band of the Municipal Police Bureau played music and observed the rituals. Then, Liu Yangshan, representing the presidium, delivered a speech reporting on the significance of commemorating the Founding Father. Subsequently, Mayor Zhou delivered a speech. Then, representatives of the presidium led the chanting of slogans: (1) Inherit the legacy of the Founding Father, (2) Realize Pan-Asianism, (3) Vigorously promote afforestation, (4) Defeat the British and Americans and complete the Greater East Asia War, (5) Revitalize China and defend East Asia, (6) Long live the Republic of China. Finally, the music was played, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Speech by the Chairman: Liu Yangshan, representing the presidium, delivered the opening remarks: Distinguished officials, comrades, today is the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father. When we recall the misfortunes encountered by our party and the disasters encountered by the people in the past twenty years, we feel sadness. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the greatest misfortune in the history of the Chinese Revolution, that is, the greatest misfortune encountered by China. Until the return of the national government to its capital in the 29th year of the Republic, it can be said to be the re-departure of the Chinese Revolution. With the start of the Greater East Asia War, it can be said that the Chinese Revolution, with very correct methods, has embarked on a very correct path, driving out the British and American imperialists. Now the British and American imperialists are still struggling in their last breath, and the Communist Party is still doing evil, so that the construction of the country cannot proceed smoothly. Therefore, we know that if the British and American imperialism is not eliminated one day, the Chinese Revolution will not be successful one day. In the future, we only have to fight to the death with the British and Americans, and the whole country must rise up together to assist friendly nations and jointly destroy the British and Americans in order to achieve the final success of the Chinese Revolution. Furthermore, if the Communist Party is not eradicated one day, the people will not be able to live in peace one day, that is, the revolution will not be successful one day. Therefore, in addition to assisting friendly nations in destroying the British and Americans, we must also eradicate the Communist Party, recognize our goals, recognize our path, and unite together to fight together.</p>
<p>Today is also Arbor Day. The so-called planting people and planting trees, a country without talents cannot carry out national affairs, and a country without timber cannot promote construction. Moreover, planting trees can regulate the climate and prevent disasters.</p>
<p>In short, we must think of the British and American imperialism, all kinds of oppression, which has brought us to this point. Everyone should be thoroughly awakened. Today, when commemorating the 20th anniversary of the death of the Founding Father, everyone should recognize it clearly.</p>
<p>Everyone does not have to be pessimistic about the misfortune of our country. We should use our own strength to save our current crisis. We should have a kind of self-confidence, believing that under the leadership of national leaders and Shanghai officials, we will definitely be able to achieve our expected goals and complete the mission of the revolution.</p>
<p>Speech by the Mayor: Then Mayor Zhou delivered a speech, elaborating on the revolutionary spirit of the Founding Father during his lifetime and his will "Peaceful Struggle to Save China" in great detail, exhorting the people of the country, with a very alarming tone, which moved the listeners.</p>

The Mayor's Tree Planting Ceremony was held in the center of the park, followed by the Secretary-General and the heads of various bureaus and departments. On time, in the midst of the sonorous military music, Secretary-General Luo led the heads of various bureaus and departments and representatives of the presidium to conduct the tree planting ceremony. Secretary-General Luo personally wielded the gardening knife and shovel the soil, and after planting the poplar, the ceremony was completed. At that time, the China Film Company filmed the tree planting ceremony for posterity.</p>

<h3>Indigenous Vietnamese People Establish the Foundation for Independence; Minister Matsudaira Discusses the Vietnam Incident</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsudaira reported on the recent Vietnam incident, expressing his feelings as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese Imperial Government has taken independent defense measures in the South, and its minimum limit is to exclude hostile officials. In Shanghai, French military and police forces were disarmed as necessary. This measure seems to have had some impact on various parts of the world, but the statement issued by the Imperial Government has clearly stated that the French officials violated the joint defense agreement, gradually changed their attitude, and did not keep their faith, and were unwilling to cooperate jointly. Therefore, the military was forced to take this measure. As for the indigenous Vietnamese people, the Imperial Government stated in its statement that it will protect the homeland and provide absolute assistance to the indigenous people.</p>
<p>Vietnam has long been under French oppression, and its people have long hoped to realize independence under the principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Therefore, the statement of the Imperial Government has a great meaning in it. Vietnam refers to Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Dongpuzhai and Laos. Cochinchina is a purely French colony, Annam and Tonkin are under protection treaties, Dongpuzhai is contracted by the King of Annam and France, and Laos is contracted by the chiefs individually with France, all of which are French protectorates. In the past 130 years, disputes have arisen from time to time. During the Qing Dynasty, the King of Annam requested China's assistance. The Qing army fought with France and succumbed to the French military until today.</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira finally said that when I was in Guangdong, I met the leader of the Annam Independence Movement, Mr. Ling Zemin, who expressed his eagerness to restore the status of Annam. Today, this independent movement can be more hopeful. Now that the foundation for independence has been established, the goal of realizing their ideals can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Gold Inspection Office Cracks Down on Bank and Money Shop Profiteering</h3>
<p>In order to maintain business expenses, banks and money shops in the city held a joint meeting of the two industry associations and decided to increase the principle of lending interest rates. The lending interest rate of banks was increased to 18%, and the outstanding interest rate of money shops was set at 90 yuan per thousand yuan, plus a handling fee. However, the interest rates charged by banks and money shops vary greatly. Some are increased based on established principles, while others are unwilling to increase or charge interest rates beyond the established principles. It is now known that the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is paying close attention to the increase in interest rates by financial institutions. If anyone charges high interest rates outside the proper scope, they will be cracked down on.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Subsidized Rice; Procedures for Receiving Rice Stipulated; Thousands of Households Should Contact Their Affiliated Units as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>The Subsidized Rice Committee held a meeting yesterday to decide on the second phase of subsidized rice distribution. The amount of rice received by each unit in the second phase is the same as in the first phase, 30,000 shi. The designated warehouses have started to pick up the goods today, and the rice recipients should contact their affiliated units as soon as possible to complete the rice receiving procedures. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Rice recipients should obtain rice vouchers from their affiliated units immediately.</p>
<p>(2) Rice recipients should contact their affiliated units as soon as possible to inquire about the rice receiving date and warehouse location.</p>
<p>(3) Rice recipients must arrange for their own transportation or entrust a transportation company to contact their affiliated units.</p>
<p>(4) The order in which units receive rice from the warehouse will remain the same as previously stipulated: first, public welfare charities; second, news and cultural circles; third, education circles; fourth, industrial and commercial circles; and fifth, banks and money shops.</p>
<p>Education Circles to Distribute Rice Vouchers on a Scheduled Basis: The second batch of subsidized rice for the education circles will be distributed on the 15th and 16th of this month. The authorities of each school should send responsible representatives carrying the school seal and bank payment receipts to Room 306, Jing'an Building, Jing'an Temple Road, to pick up the vouchers. To avoid congestion, it is stipulated that schools in the First District (i.e., the former First and Eighth Districts) will receive the vouchers on the 15th, and schools in other districts will receive them on the 16th. As for the rice receiving date and location for each school, it will be announced later.</p>

<p>A Stroll in the Suburbs</p>
<h3>General Situation of Fahua Town</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Location of Fahua Town</p>
<p>Although Fahua Town is a township name, it is already within the city limits. Take the Route 1 streetcar to the western terminus, exit the west entrance of Taishan Road, and walk a few dozen steps to reach the street entrance of West Fahua Town. The entire town is about two li in length. In the middle section of West Fahua is the site of the Fahua Zen Temple, now dilapidated. Fahua Town gets its name from this temple.</p>
<p>Visiting the Security Command</p>
<p>The western end of Fahua Town is the former site of Zhengshi Middle School, where the Municipal Security Command is now located. The reporter took the opportunity to assist a friend in the accounting office of the command, and was guided by the leadership to visit the various offices of the institution. The command has two divisions, the Staff Division and the General Affairs Division. The affiliated security teams of Fengxian, Nanhui, Shenjiang, Chongming, Jiading, Baoshan, and Chuansha counties are stationed in seven county districts. There are also three regiments, the Training Regiment No. 1 and Training Regiment No. 2. The Training Regiment is located at the headquarters, and the regimental commander is Mr. Han Shangying. Regiments No. 1 and No. 2 are located in the suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>The salaries of officers and soldiers of the security team have been adjusted separately since February. The monthly salary of a major general is 70,500 yuan, and the lowest lieutenant is 18,325 yuan. Officers receive three dou of Lao rice per month, and their families also receive three dou of rice. Officers at the headquarters are also provided with two meals, a benefit unmatched by any other municipal agency.</p>
<p>Visiting the Blockade Administration Office</p>
<p>The Municipal Clearing Countryside Area Blockade Administration Office is also located on the third floor of the Zhengshi school site. The office was previously under the jurisdiction of the Clearing Countryside Affairs Bureau, but on February 1st, it was directly under the Municipal Government. When the reporter visited the director's office to interview Director Gu Shuo, he was out on official business. However, Commissioner Zhu Qingshou was present. Director Gu took office as the director of the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration on the 3rd of this month, so he was unable to be in the office all day. The Blockade Administration Office has seven management offices and fifty-six checkpoints in the first, second, and third clearing countryside areas. The focus of work is in the suburban areas.</p>
<p>In addition to the Security Command and the Blockade Administration Office, the former Clearing Countryside Affairs Bureau was also located at the Zhengshi school site. Since Mr. Su Chengde took over as director, it has been moved to the old site of the Central Research Institute Experimental Hall on Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>Overview of Industry, Commerce, and Education</p>
<p>Fahua Town has one main street running east-west. On both sides of the street are low-rise tile-roofed houses, all small shops and handicraft workshops. There are three factories in the town: one cotton ginning factory and two textile factories. All have been suspended due to limited raw materials and electricity. There is one primary school, the Fahua Obligatory School.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Reorganizes Gun Licenses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, having investigated the merger of the old First and Second Police Bureaus, finds it necessary to reinvestigate civilian firearms and change the permit format. For the sake of adjustment, the bureau is reorganizing gun licenses (including those for guards and storage). All license holders must submit their licenses to the Second Division (South 130) of the bureau for application procedures by the 25th of this month. If firearms are not registered within the registration period, they will be confiscated upon discovery, and the owners will be severely punished. Therefore, those who possess firearms and have never registered them should register before the aforementioned deadline. As for firearms in the custody of the bureau, for the sake of reconfirmation, the owners should submit their old receipts and reissue new receipts. For detailed information, please inquire with the Firearm License Section of the Police Preparedness Division of the Second Division.</p>

<h3>Charity Market Regularly Distributes Bonuses to Schools</h3>
<p>The joint charity market organized by the four groups to help students out of school was made possible by the enthusiastic cooperation of students from various schools, resulting in considerable success. Now, in order to commend the enthusiasm of the students of various schools, a portion of the total income (over 26 million yuan) has been allocated as a bonus for the best performing schools. The amount of this bonus has been properly allocated, and letters have been sent to the authorities of the participating schools, asking them to send a representative with the school's official receipt and the issued bonus collection slip to the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm from March 15th to 22nd to collect the bonus. Those who fail to do so will be deemed to have automatically waived the bonus, and no further issuance will be made. It is also hoped that the school authorities will increase the number of new student loan students after receiving the bonus.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow Association Submits Petitions to Authorities Demanding Strict Arrest and Punishment of Murderer Jiang Shiyan</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Xu Xu Peiwen being brutally murdered by Black Hat Jiang Shiyan, the Zhenjiang Fellow Association yesterday specially submitted petitions to the Ministry of Construction requesting that the China Railway authorities be strictly ordered to improve road administration and rectify discipline, and continued to petition the Municipal Government to earnestly arrest the murderer. Excerpts from the petitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>(Omitted above) "After investigating, Xu Xu Peiwen, the wife of Xu Sen, a member of the association, was brutally murdered by Black Hat Jiang Shiyan of the China Central Railway Company North Station on March 4th. The association reported the situation to your government on March 10th, requesting that the competent police bureau be strictly ordered to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice according to law. It has now been many days since the incident occurred, but the main offender Jiang Shiyan has not yet been arrested. Therefore, the association petitions your government to quickly order the police bureau to earnestly arrest the murderer. The association also intends to offer a reward for the arrest, so that the case can be solved as soon as possible, to ensure the safety of travelers and uphold the law."</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Construction</p>
<p>(Omitted above) "After investigating, the employees of the China Central Railway Company (commonly known as Black Hats) are usually arrogant and unruly, and disregard the law, which has long been resented by the public. Now they dare to openly commit violence, resulting in death, which is truly outrageous. Moreover, the main offender Jiang Shiyan fled after the incident and has not been apprehended. The China Central Railway Company has long been lax in its management of its employees, resulting in such a tragedy occurring in the station witnessed by the public, which is already inexcusable. Moreover, after the incident, it still turned a blind eye, allowing the murderer to escape and remain at large, not only failing to fulfill its responsibility to assist in the arrest, but also showing no serious expression, which is deeply puzzling. Therefore, the association petitions your ministry to quickly order the China Central Railway Company to order the guarantor to hand over the murderer for arrest and prosecution, and to strictly order the company to earnestly improve road administration and rectify discipline, to ensure the safety of travelers."</p>

<h3>Seventh Welfare Football Match: Overseas Chinese Federation vs. Portuguese Merchants</h3>
<p>The seventh Raleigh Football Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Football Association to raise medical funds for charitable organizations such as the Red Cross Third Hospital and Southeast Hospital, is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 15th of this month (Thursday) at the Racecourse. There are three types of tickets: 20,000, 10,000, and 5,000 yuan, which are sold separately by the aforementioned charitable organizations. The football association has decided that the opposing teams will be the Overseas Chinese Federation and the Portuguese Merchants. The two teams met once in the League A competition, and the Portuguese Merchants were defeated by the Overseas Chinese Federation by a score of 2-5. This time, the narrow road to revenge will inevitably lead the Portuguese Merchants to retaliate, and a fierce battle is expected.</p>
