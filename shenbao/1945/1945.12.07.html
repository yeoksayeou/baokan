<h3>國軍將順利入瀋陽　長城區共軍紛紛逃竄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據重慶六日廣播稱：國軍正向東九省南部長驅直入，現已越瀋陽西北九十九里之新民軍站而織續推進中。杜聿明將軍告記者稱：渠希望竭力避免流血方式，在一二日內使國軍開抵瀋陽，故渠展緩進軍。目下蘇軍已對共軍發生相常影響，使其退出瀋陽，以便國軍順利開入。北寗路沿長城瀋陽一帶共軍主力，現正紛向三路撤退，據云將退至熱河省境及安東邊界。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶六日電〕據東北前綫來電，國軍沿北寗路推進，現距瀋陽僅六十華里，但在獲得蘇聯同意之前，不願遽行入城。瀋陽仍由蘇軍據守，惟城內已無共軍。據息，共軍現有進入哈爾濱之勢，並擁有大批飛機，東北保安隊司今社聿明將軍則並無飛機。錦州日軍飛機，共軍於退出之前，已將其全數毀壞。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶六日電〕報載稱：北寗路新民瀋陽段，大致完好無損，可使機械化部隊迅速開入瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕合衆社特派員稱：國軍切盼對瀋陽居民留下最良好之印象，俾使東北保安司令之合法軍隊，名符其實。觀察家認爲杜將軍之能順利抵達瀋陽，乃因共產黨之遊擊戰術，不敵杜將軍部下久經沙塲之勁旅。共產軍於山海關附近一役認識此點後，即退入鄕村地帶，以圖襲擊國軍漫長之補給路綫。此外，蘇聯對共產黨之壓力，已使瀋陽成爲眞空地帶。杜將軍深知其補給路綫雖遠較共軍爲優，然今日必須通過畏達三百里之夾道，隨時可遭俟機共軍襲擊。是以開拓走廊佔領兩旁之城纖，實較單純之推進更關緊要。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州四日電〕國軍進駐錦州後，一面澈底肅淸後方交通綫，同時由三路並進：北路已達義縣且越至以西地區，中路於過溝帮子後，更向南路迫近盤縣邊境，自山海關以至綏中錦西錦縣，及熾道沿綫，已無共軍。北寗客票車，隔日一次，往返秦皇島，已三次無障碍。</p>
<h3>長春討論進行中　留平接收人員將重返工作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平六日電〕關於國軍空運潘陽問題，聞東北特派員蔣經國，與蘇聯佔領軍司令馬林諾夫斯基，今日正在長春討論。蔣經國係於四日偕同經濟委員會特派員張嘉璈飛抵長春，由馬林諾夫斯基親至機塲相迎，並由蘇聯軍隊護送入城。據悉：張家璈已通知滯留北平之東北接收委員團，謂東北情形已大見改善，促彼等準備速返長春。軍事委員會東北行營董副參謀長，亦提出同樣保證。上月間接收柬北人員大部份撇退時，僅有董將軍及少數單事代表仍留長春，與蘇聯當局保持密切接觸，聞情形安謐。東北人民渴望國軍開到。遼寗省主席徐箴，已在錦縣設立臨時省政府，一俟國軍開入瀋陽，亦將遷入城內。中央政府官吏在東北恢復施政，十四年來，尙係第一次。據息：瀋陽最近發生騷擾，但原因不明。東北保安司令部北平辦事處主任，最近自錦縣返此，據談中共軍李永昌及劉彪所部約七八萬人，已分裂成小股，散佈於長城及錦縣間，二萬人已開人熱河省，七八千人已被國軍所俘。外傳東北共軍二萬人被擊斃之說，並無目擊者或其他報告證實。李部係於本年八月中旬開入東北，負責佔據熱河及遼寗兩省。</p>
<h3>梁寒操返渝</h3>
<p>新疆哈薩克族談判　預料兩星期內結束</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕梁寒操五日十二時，由迪化飛抵渝。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕最高國防委員會副秘書長梁寒操自新疆返渝後，今日宣稱：中央政府與新疆哈薩克族之談判，預料在兩星期內可告結束，於此，阻撓和平治理回民已久之各項問題，將不復存在。梁氏透露：中央政府人員，曾與哈薩克族代表舉行三次會議，謀使哈薩克族獲得高度自治權，頃已同意下列各點：（一）哈薩克各區縣長，由人民選舉之：（二）漢人與哈薩克人間，准予自由貿易；（三）哈薩克軍隊，實際上予以保持；（四）新疆哈薩克族與蘇聯哈薩克蘇維埃社會主義共和國問之貿易，仍須受國際貿易法規調節。梁氏稱：在過去兩個月之談判中，蘇聯駐迪化總領事曾竭力斡放。</p>
<h3>二中全會　明正舉行　參政會二月召開</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶六日電〕據確悉，二中全會於一月舉行，參政會於二月初召開。</p>
<h3>美特使馬歇爾將軍　廿日前後可抵華</h3>
<p>何總司令將在滬或渝與其會晤</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕何總司令應欽，六日於記者招待會席上答復詢問時透露，新任美國駐華特使馬歇爾將單，的可於廿日前後抵華，渠將在上海或重慶與之晤面。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕中國外交界消息靈通方面稱：關於美國對華政策，仍望國共雙方能在蔣委員長領導之下獲取統一。據稱，杜魯門對新任駐華特使馬歇爾將軍亦有此項指示。渠等對馬歇爾已作歡迎準備。　〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯昨稱，馬歇爾將軍已被召，六日在參院珍珠港事件調查委員會中作證，俟證詞發畢，立刻啓程赴華，爲杜魯門總統執行特殊使命，</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕美駐華特使前陸軍參謀長馬歇爾，今日出席珍珠港事件調查委員會作證，略謂，在珍珠港事件發生前，並無聯合國參謀會議導致美國作戰，除非因太平洋受攻擊而起，本人曾參加美英加荷官員會議。</p>
<h3>共黨唆使失業軍人　投彈聯大師範學院　昆明手溜彈案真相大白</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶六日電〕昆明各大學敎授二百人，爲聲援手溜彈慘案，已自昨日起開始罷敎一星期，以示對被難學生之哀思。據稱：失業軍人向學生投彈，係受共黨唆使，並獲法幣三萬元之代價。</p>
<p>〔中央社昆明五日電〕聯大手溜彈事件及其有關聯之案件，本市公開審訊，於昨日舉行。共有三案，以第三案最關重要，一二兩項較爲簡單。第一案係軍官總隊學員三人，與雲大學生，於十一月三十日，在正義路毆打案。訊明係學生在該路貼標語，又有少數學生，前往撕毀，發生衝突，該學員周海泉等，前往調解，致發生口角，因而被毆。次一日雲大曾派代表，前往道歉。第二案，係十二月一日聯大文法學院軍官總隊學員，與學生毆打案，訊明係因該隊一部份學員，往大觀樓旅行，經過聯大門外，被學生投以石子，遂起衝突。當時曾有一手溜彈，由校內丟出，只傷軍官總隊學員一人，學生並無受傷者。第三案，則係聯大師範學院手溜彈案件，因此案發生學生死傷，情節重大，訊問較詳，茲將第三案主犯，供辭摘錄如下：提審投彈犯陳奇達，劉友治。軍法官先訊陳奇達籍貫姓名，陳奇達供稱：原名陳柬生，三十八歲，湖南衡陽人，曾任副營長，今年三月編餘，即在昆明做小生意，軍法官問：十二月一日你到師範學院幹事麼？答：那天我經過大西門時，因爲人多，去看熱鬧。問：你爲什麼丟手溜彈？答：根本沒有。問：已有人親眼者見你丟的，你要講實話。答：不是我自己動意去的，有一個二十多歲的人，和我在茶館內，時常喝茶，我在吃茶時發牢騷，他跑來同我講朋友。十一月二十九日他對我說，你們幹國民黨的部隊，本來就沒有意議，他們都是軍閥，當然白替他們幹。他說我現在要你作一件事，又有財，又可以作官。的定三十日晚在北門外運花池公路邊見面。當晚他給我三萬元，並答應可以介紹我去作支隊司令，祇要我服從他的指揮。當時約定十二月一日上午九時，在北門外會面。該日我應約前往，他帶我走到西門外師範學院，望見門口聚集了許多人他說這就是你服從我做事的時候了。就交我兩顆手溜彈，要我向那邊人羣中投擲，我接了後，他就走開了。這時我在路上徘徊，恰巧有個熟識的朋友劉友治來了，他和我是一樣境况的人我就呌他也投一枚，並答應給他一萬元。問：你所說在茶館裏認識這個人，住在什麼地方，呌什什麼名字？答：他沒有告訴我住址，他說他叫美凱。問：他給你手溜庫時，還有什麼話對你講嗎？答：他同我約定當晚在翠湖會見。問：你是怎樣丟的手溜彈？答：那時我看見有四五十人，擁進師範學院，我就同劉友治一路跟進去，看見有人撕標語，打標語牌，裏面吵起來，很多人向外面跑，後面許多學生追，並用石泥塊亂打，　　我認爲時機已至，急忙丟了一個手溜彈。立刻人羣亂跑，我就跑了。沒跑幾步，又聽到饗了一聲，大概是劉友治丟的。問：你同劉友治怎樣認微的？答：在路上跑生路認識的。的問：你丟完手溜彈，又去翠湖會過姜凱沒有。答：去過，他沒有來。問：你在什麼地方被抓着的？答：因爲沒有見着姜凱，我就想到曲靖去，第二天我到車站，又碰到劉友治，他向我要錢，我因爲身上沒有好多錢了，只給他幾千元，他不願意，就同我吵了起來，被便衣隊發覺了，一起在車站被捕。軍法官繼訊劉友治，據供三十二歲，浙江浦江人，曾任貴州保安處副官，去年十一月離職後，作小生意。問：你住在什麼地方？答：我長跑曲靖，霑益，沒有一定住址。問：你和陳奇達怎樣認識？答：跑生意時在路上認識的。問：十二月一日你同誰到師院去？答：我出去玩，在大西門外遇到陳奇達，他對我說，你現在因沒有錢，我要你幫我去做一件事，那邊學生正在衝突，你幫我丟一個手溜彈，送一萬元報酬。問：什麼時候丟的？答：我聽到響了一聲之後，我就丟了。</p>
<h3>何總司令昨日宣稱　日軍繳械提早完成　少數地區因共軍擾亂遲延</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕何總司令六日下午三時舉行記者招待會，此係何氏離京二月前與歸來後之第一次，參謀長蕭　肅等均出席。何氏宜稱，依據最近各地日軍繳械進行情形之報告以觀，顯較預計者（）四個月至六個月）爲迅速，截至目前，在華日軍卅五個師團繳完者已有廿五個，正在繳械者八個，僅餘兩個尙未繳械。獨立旅團四十一個之中，已有廿四個繳完，六個正在繳械，其他獨立警備隊及支隊廿隊，亦有十三隊已繳完　，三隊正繳中。至特種兵隊五隊，則僅餘一隊未繳一。何氏繼稱：若以戰區及地區計，則各地日軍之繳械情形，第一二兩方面軍及第一·三·五·六·七·九各戰區，均已全部完成，惟三方面軍之蘇北，第十戰區之海州，第十一戰區之保定，石門，滄縣及第二戰區之平遙，沁縣，均因交通被共軍破壞，國軍不能如期到達指定地點，致繳械遲延，然國軍均兼程推進中。何氏聲言，如共軍不加擾亂，十二月內可以畢事。</p>
<p>運送日俘僑為當前困難</p>
<p>談及日本投降官兵及日僑之集中管理與輸送返國一節，何氏認爲問題甚大，蓋在華日軍約一百三十萬，日僑約四十七萬，合灣日僑四十萬在外，總計一百八十餘萬，中國缺乏船隻，故俘僑返國之職送，不得不請助於盟邦，而俘僑散布收復區全面，內地運輸多被共軍破壞，故是否能如期到達港口亦成問題，惟何氏指出，自十一月十五日起，美國巳決定用登陸艇一〇七艘及接收之日輸七艘，開始陸續起運，迄目前獲得報告者，已有六萬一千運出矣。至管理方面，何氏稱，各地均已成立日僑管理處與分所，不僅對渠等之行動有嚴格限制，並糾正感化其過去錯誤思想。至利用俘僑勞力亦積極進行中。</p>
<p>接收東九省應該無問題</p>
<p>記者三十餘人，於聆取何氏上述報告後，復紛紛發問，一似渴極求飲者，然綜其大要，首爲關於接收東九省問題，何氏認爲接收東北，「應該沒有問題」，蓋蘇聯旣信守，中蘇條約，所餘者令為我國內部問題。目前共軍竄擾長城各口，致使國軍接收東北一再遲延，何氏證實國軍空運赴長春事，惟說明截至六日所得報告，已到達長春者尙僅爲機塲地面工作人員，至外傳國軍進入瀋陽說，何氏拒加證實。</p>
<p>共產軍騷擾魯南最嚴重</p>
<p>關於各地共軍騷擾情形，何氏指出，目前以魯南一帶最爲嚴重，上月廿四日以來，臨城·棗莊·韓莊·沙溝各地，迭遭共軍攻擊，彼等顯以破壞該地煤礦爲目的，現韓莊沙溝雖已失陷，但國軍決本中央恢復交通及生產之意旨，向前推進，以眞正解放魯南人民於水火中。至蘇北及鄂皖邊境情勢，近已稍好轉。此外，何氏復稱，在渝以未參加中央對共產黨談判，故詳情不悉，惟渠個人希望政治協商會議能順利舉行，蓋和平統一乃中央之一貫決策，所謂內亂，「只要共軍停止進攻，便無內亂可言」。</p>
<p>國軍已裁汰八十餘個師</p>
<p>記者有以整軍近況詢問何氏乾，據稱，截至本年十月，國軍已裁汰八十餘師，預定計劃中之第一階段，可謂已告完成，惟全部計劃之實現，須視共軍問題之如何演變而定。何氏續稱，我國自製輕武器，已不成問題，未來之美國軍事顧問團任務，爲協助國軍敎育及建設工作，凡此皆爲建軍前途之好消息。至本人視察台灣事，目前尙無一定行期。</p>
<h3>紀念黃郛</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕國府六日下令，褒揚黃郛，除其生平事蹟已付史館立傳外，其原籍地方紀念祠館，着浙江省政府查明修復，並妥爲維護，用示政府篤念忠　，有加無已之至意。</p>
<h3>外部美洲司長　由程希孟代理　陳國廉來滬履任</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶六日電〕外部美洲司長張忠紱辭職，程希孟代理司長，川康特派員吳藹宸近調平津特派員，外部駐上海辦事處主任陳國廉，六日搭機赴任。駐巴達維亞總領事蔣家棟，定十五日離渝赴任，駐馬達加斯加領事谷兆芬已赴任。</p>
<h3>赫爾利氏公開陳述　艾其森等袒共經過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶六日電〕赫爾利昨在美參院外委會所作證詞，此間極為關切，並加討論，惟中共方面拒絕發表意見，僅繼續責難駐華美軍，要求其撤退。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕美前任駐華大使赫爾利少將，昨向參院外委會稱，渠所以置國務院訓令於不顧者，乃欲促成中蘇條約故耳。赫氏又披露渠反對以租借武器與配備供給中國共產黨，並指責前駐重慶之美外交官兩人暗圖破壞其地位，該兩人爲蘇維斯與艾其森，其後出任駐日盟軍總帥麥克阿瑟之政治顧問。赫氏又稱，蘇維斯乃一取巧之外交官，原被派會同史迪威爾將軍在華工作者，於一九四四年十月間以「聽任國民政府瓦解之報告書」呈交國務院，艾其森則迭次主張以租借品供給共軍，以謀暗中破壞其地位。華盛頓於今春經渠抗議而召回阿蘇兩氏後，復將艾氏置於渠之監督者地位，渠旋與英首相（邱吉爾）外相（艾登）及蘇方官員在莫斯科談話後，謀在重慶與莫斯科之間從事斡旋，惟國務院囑渠「弗作斡旋或勸告，僅可提供建議」，此訓令係載於當時美國務卿史退了紐斯簽字之電報中者，渠並不理會，因渠認爲此與渠所知促成中國團結之訓令相矛盾，故係謬誤之舉，渠意蘇聯完全同意於美國對華政策，且信蘇方遵守八月間所訂中蘇條約之條件。赫氏繼又否認渠擅自在華施行個人政策，以代華盛頓政府之工作，謂，渠近在延安與共黨領袖談話，以美國願望中國各黨派間作政治和解，勸導彼等，已有若干成功希望，當時毛澤東向渠稱，美國有一計劃，欲「樹立統制下之日本帝國，作爲亞洲之穩定勢力」，待毛澤東認爲艾其森與蘇維斯被任爲麥帥政治顧問，已證實美國有此意岡，談判遂告崩潰。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平六日電〕昨夜與今晨，北平第一次搜捕漢奸，就逮者約二百四十名。目下雖無準確消息，衆信僞華北政務委員會前主席王蔭泰，王克敏與王揖唐等三人，在被捕者之列。此項工作，由北平警備司令部執行。關於逮捕漢奸之新聞，官方並未正式發表，然確悉偽北平市政府前市長兩人，已遭拘留。</p>

<h3>社論　從速嚴辦漢奸</h3>
<p>敵寇投降，瞬逾三月，一切措施，都在積極展開。但覺得遺憾的是；直到最近，我們曾經一度或數度在報紙上看見有漢奸的拘捕，却未看見有漢奸的法辦。近日上海法院曾有漢奸案件的公開審訊；但第一個受到這樣審訊的僅是一個在僞內政部裏當過視察的小漢奸，而且現在還沒有定　。此外，另一件公開審理的漢奸案件是一個曾充敵人翻譯的工頭，和一個曾任僞立法院立法委員的漢奸。同時，據司法機關負責者稱，承辦審理漢奸之法官，均住法院，不與外界接觸，以免遭受　嚮。又云現上海高等法院待審理漢奸案件約僅二十件；市據本報昨日的專訪，則謂待審的漢奸，爲數有一百另二人；將以每　二十人，分批鞠訊。凡此種種，都不免令我們重有所　。</p>
<p>我們覺得奇怪的是：上海高等法院待審理的漢奸案件，數目小得驚人。偌大一個上海，這里是從前漢奸羣聚的地方，有各式各樣的通敵的奸充，而迄至現在爲止，高等法院待審理的漢奸案件爲數只有這一點。當然，有許多案件還沒有提交法院偵查起訴。但三月來法院所受理待訊的漢奸案件小到這樣一個數字，實在使人覺得驚歎稱奇。依據國府頒布的漢奸　　　　及處理漢奸案件條例，僞組織之官吏在簡任以上及所任薦任機關之首長者均須懲治，單就這一項而論，漢奸案件也決不致在法院待理的這些數半。又依上述條例，除軍人外。審理漢奸案件均歸法院，以高等法院爲第一審，則漢奸案件之應歸法院審理者，爲數常甚可觀；而現在法院待審理的漢奸案件，數字何以竟小得可憐？　我們又覺得奇怪的是：據司法機關負責者談，承辦審理漢奸案件的法官，均住院內，以免與外界接觸。這句話的被提出，刦襲凟了法官的尊嚴，法院的尊嚴。法官的公正嚴明，本不以住處的是否在院內爲凖繩，而不與外界接觸，也不必一定住在院內，如果要與外界接觸，即住在院內亦復不能避免。况且與外界接觸是一件事，定識的嚴明又是一件事。</p>
<p>因此，關於處理漢奸案件，我們不能不提供幾點意見：</p>
<p>第一，漢奸案件的處理，是一宗人民所最關心的專；而進行的滯緩，足以使民氣銷沈。慕索里尼在北意被人民武裝部隊弋獲後，當經處以極刑。這雖一時大快人心，然而終究於法不合。我們在處理漢奸案件時，一切均須合乎法度，依法處斷，始能振奮人心。國家對於處理漢奸的立法，一本寬大，但「立法從寬』的背後，却含有「執法從嚴」的深義。凡條例內沒有規定的，固不可任意株邇，而明文有規定者，均　從　拘捕檢舉，依法送由法院嚴辦。其由陸軍或其他方面所緝獲之漢奸，除依法可由軍事審判者外，尤應一律迅速移送法院訊辦，不可長此在拘留待訊之中。</p>
<p>第二，漢奸的地位雖有高低，但其同爲叛國則一。所以在審理漢奸案件時，次號漢奸固應送由高等法院審理，就是頭號漢奸也應高等法院依法公開審理。近日來，我們陸續看見有頭號漢奸如周逆佛海陳逆公博及褚逆民誼等的就逮，但是到現在爲止，迄未看見他們的公開受訊。我們雖然明知道些大小漢奸，都將處以所應得之刑，但審訊的滯延，終究使人民心裏起上一個暗影。</p>
<p>第三，在處理漢奸案件上，應該迅速。大小漢奸的被逮，爲時已有兩三月。這些漢奸可以說都是逆行昭著的人，他們應該於被捕後立即依法審理懲處。即使須要偵查或檢舉，則兩三個月已經够了，萬不容再延遲下去。對於已捕獲的漢奸，固應迅速法辦，就是此後續有捕獲的漢奸，也應於捕獲後儘速公開審訊。</p>
<p>第四，各地一律從嚴緝捕漢奸，繼續公布名單，亦爲當今要圖，依處理漢奸案件條例第二條各款所列的項目，雖在立法從寬的本意，對於其他附逆的人員未予深究，但依執法唯嚴的精神，該條各款明文所列的澳奸人數爲數當甚可勸。法國政權恢復後，戴高樂政府所處理「法奸」案件的人欺逾四十萬；比利時的「比奸」處刑者亦有五萬人。敵寇在我們的國土盤據了八年，其間各式大小漢奸合乎處理漢奸案件條例所規定者，爲數自當成千成萬。但自河山光復以來，我們所已看到的漢奸緝獲名單，為數實感寥寥無幾，而這少數的緝獲漢奸中現在上海最高法院待審的為數有二十，或如本報所記的一百零二人。無論是二十也好，是一百零二也好，這些數字都未能滿足人民的期望，這不是說我們緝捕漢奸的不力，却也實在足以提醒我們這方面的努力仍有加緊的必要。麥克阿瑟元帥在日本所已捕獲的戰爭要犯已經有三百十八人，我們所捕到的漢奸，對於這個數目，似乎也有些困離。我們應該迅速從嚴緝捕尙在逍遙法外的奸宄，繼續布其名單，俾眾周知。並且如此辦法，更有一層好處，即可使八年之中，淪陷區內的人民，空間誰是漢奸，誰有嫌疑，早得一個明自的答覆，以免隨時濫捕，人人自危，發生許多的流弊。</p>
<p>總之，漢奸案件的從速嚴辦，不僅是一宗宗關法紀的事，人心的振奮與頽唐，道德及正義的維繫與淪亡，其關鍵均在乎比。貝當位居法國元帥，拉佛爾及吉斯林之流亦曾位居要津，現可受到國法的制裁，而我國通敵的巨奸元惡，迄今多未繼以國法，這與國內民心國際觀感都是極有影響的事。我們因此提出從速嚴辦漢奸的呼號。</p>

<h3>英美昨在華盛頓　簽訂經濟協定　美貸英四十四億元援助復興</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕英美借款協定，今晨在華盛頓簽字。談判在華盛頓進行凡十二星期後，英國今可向美國獲得借款四十四萬萬美元。雙方談判人員對各項細點，作最後之討論後，昨夜商妥借款條件，衆信官方將於今夜公布此事，而英相阿特里亦有在今日下院集會時宣佈談判結果之可能。英代表團現將轉往渥太華，與加拿大商借信用放款。華盛頓方面傳英方擬向加拿大商借之款，約計九千三百萬英鎊。</p>
<p>〔路透社特派員布樞華盛頓六日電〕美國已同意以四十四萬萬美元貸予英國，其中三十七萬五千萬美元係信用放款，供貿易之用，六萬五千萬元用以最後清算刻在聯合王國內之租借物品。英國則允自借款批准起之一年後，廢止　用英金差額。此項歷史性之協定，足使英國受戰爭損害之經濟復得活力。</p>

<p>此次借款，利息二厘，自一九五一年十二月三十一日起，分五十年償還。美國務院次官克萊頓謂，英國償還之總額，計爲五十九萬六千二百五十萬美元，無論何年，英國之外匯平準如認爲不足，可免付利息。英國已同意自協定生效起十二個月後，几未凍結之英金差額，均得以任何貨幣併貿易往來。此協定必須經英美國會雙方批准。克萊頓告記者稱，英人原擬多借，惟余覺此數巳可使彼等滿意。此項借款對於貿易殊有裨益，多方面之貿易亦可賴以恢復。</p>
<p>擴大世界貿易建立貨幣制度</p>
<p>美國務院於該協定發表之同時，復向世界各國發表白皮書，對擴大世界貿易有所建議，阿特里杜魯門之共同宣言有謂，英美雙方自始即覺建立世界貿易及貨幣制度，以使各國貿易可依多邊而一致之基礎而進行，對於英美兩國政府均有利益。談判以後殊爲順利，乃成立協定，由美國貸與聯合王國三七·七五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇，藉以便利聯合王國購買美國貨物，協助聯合王國應付戰後過渡時期外匯平準之不足，協助聯合王國維持適當之黃金及金元準備，並助其扒負多方面貿易責任。此項貸款可使聯合王國酌减進口貿易及外匯之統制，俾得與其他各國向擴大多邊貿易之共同目標進展。該宜言復稱，借款中有六五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元業已貸與聯合王國，以淸償現在該國境內租借物品之價額，此乃最後之全部淸償。聯合王國因淸償租借物品，取得剩餘資產，及美國在聯合王國境內所有之設備及其他等等血欠美國之款，共計六五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>美向各國建議撤除貿易限制</p>
<p>至於美國務院向各國所提之白皮書，其建議之事項有下列數端：（一）撤銷政府所頒佈之限制，各國政府應使用其權力，撤銷過度限制自由貿易之規定。（二）撤銷私人工商組合及托辣斯所頒佈之限制，建議在國際貿易組織下，設立特種機構，接受各方面對於國際工商組合及托辣斯所定種種限制之申訴，及如何加以補救之意見。（三）防免主要商品市塲之紊亂，此事應由各國政府相互交換意見。（四）防免生產及分配之不規則狀態，各國應舉行會議，成立一般協定，規定某國將維持足量而經常之生產，而避免使用足以損及他國或妨碍擴大世界貿易之方法。（五）建立國際貿易機構，制定與其他聯合國機關類似之章程，對貿易壁壘，經商限制，國際貨物交換等一一加以規定。</p>

<h3>做個不折不扣榜樣　確保乾乾淨淨聲譽　北大代校長傅斯年表示</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶航訊〕北大代理校長傳斯年氏頃語記者，略謂：</p>
<p>北大無關</p>
<p>（一）專科以上學校必須要為下一代青年對於禮義廉恥四字，做一個不折不扣的榜樣。北大原先是請全體敎員內遷的，事實上除周作人等一二人外，未內遷之少數教員，亦均轉入燕京輔仁任敎，僞北大創辦人錢道蓀原非北大敎授，因此偽北大敎授與北大毫無關係。</p>
<p>不發聘書</p>
<p>（二）朱部長會語本人，偽北大員絕無全部由補習班聘用之事，僅有少數係按陸軍總部徵調敵僞人員辦法被徵調服務，均不發聘書，與北大亦無關係。</p>
<p>意見一致</p>
<p>（三）自大觀點言，本校前任校長蔣夢麟，明春返國之胡適校長，以及北大敎授團體，渝昆兩地同學會，和本人意見，完全一致，無論現在將來，北大均不容僞校僞組織人士插足其間。</p>
<p>部長同意</p>
<p>（四）鹵北大有約對自由不聘請偽校偽組織之人任敎，此點已獲朱部長同意，吾人目的在求確保北大乾乾淨淨之聲譽。聞燕京大學已將該校參加僞北大之敎授一律辭聘，本人對此極爲佩服。</p>
<h3>教局擬劃分　全市十六學區</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕市敎育局鑒于未市行政區域，已由市府劃分爲卅三區，乃根據各行政區地域遠近及人口多寡，劃分學區，以爲實施國民敎育之準備。聞該局劃分學區前，曾由國民敎育處派員赴警察局戶籍課調查各區戶口，及學齡兒童人數，以爲劃區之根據據，除舊公共租界及法租界與虹口區域各分兩區外，餘均酌予合併，計全市應設國民學校之區域，共劃分爲十六學區。全市市立小學總數，現共一百零九校，戰前有公立學校二百餘所，目下恢復者，實祇及戰前之半數。且聞新要收之行政區中，如三·強恕·馬橋·七　·莘溪·顓橋等十餘校，均爲辦理多年之公立學校，現亦在本市範圍以內。聞敎育局顧局長，正在請示市府核定辦法云。</p>
<h3>國立商學院　師生反對併校　推張院長向敎部力爭</h3>
<p>〔大華社重慶航訊〕國立商學院成立以來，業有八載，歷屆畢業生，服務公私機關，頗著成績，抗戰勝利後，敎育都曾擬將該院遷往上海，藉圖發展。近該院忽得旅渝校友電告，敎部有將該院併人某大學之議，全院師生獲訊，異常不滿，發起組織護校委員會，續極展開護校工作，並聲稱不准任何學校接受，否則將有意外發生。該院爲妥善愼重計，曾一致公推張院長即日首途赴渝，堅持主張，向部力爭，茲悉張院長業已專程赴渝。該院有關人士稱：如不能獲得圓滿結果。全院師生將徒步赴渝請願，在明令尙未發表以前，全院師生，仍極力鎭定，照常上課。</p>
<h3>赤水河畔的大夏大學</h3>
<p>— 黃衣青</p>
<p>當第一顆侵略的子彈在黃浦江面上爆發時，梵皇渡中山路上的大夏大學，即與閘北江灣路上的復且大學西遷廬山，並組織聯合大學，爲樹立抗戰後國內聯合大學的先聲。此後繼有西南聯大，西北聯大，及敎會聯大。迨國軍自武漢西撤，大夏大學續遷貴陽，單狡設立，在高物價的重壓下，艱苦支撑，六年中弦誦未嘗中輟。去年冬天，敵騎蹂躪獨山，都勻，大夏大學乃再遷黔川交界處的赤水縣，其時風聲鶴唳，倉卒北移，而秩序井然，迄今爲西南各地人士所讚頌。一種師生合作，同舟共濟的情神，在這一役烽火中充分表現出來。</p>
<p>赤水因地處偏僻，民智阻塞，雖在戰時，與外界音訊仍極隔膜，於是該地利用無綫電，每日廣播新聞，並出版小型報紙—「快訊」兩次，市民莫不爭聽快覩。本來一所大學在學術上作專門研究以外，尙負有改造及推動社會的使命，所以凡有關敎育，衛生等各種事業，全體師生利用研究的餘晷，盡力與地方當局合作，因此當地的士紳與市民，對該大學的遷移北來，莫不表示最大的歡迎，除給予種種方便之外，並協助校舍校具之解決。</p>
<p>大夏大學，現分設文，理，法，商等學院。自敎部有取消師範學院單獨設立動議後，該大學仍擬恢復添設最有歷史最有聲譽的敎育學院。並聞敎部已核准該大學於明年五月問遷返上海梵皇渡原址。現全校師生及畢業校友正以全力準備復校工作。不久，八年寥落之梵皇渡麗娃栗圯河畔，將另有一番新氣景了。可是綠楊夾通的赤水河畔，也許會感覺到空氣沈寂罷。</p>

<h3>大批查封物資　不日將平價出售　密告案均經詳細澈查</h3>
<p>上海區敵僞產業處理局，先後接收本市倉庫，爲數達四百餘家。其中經點淸者已達百處以上，昨經審議會將其中三十三處所存物資，分別加以處理。除一部份交由有關機關運用，或公開標賣外，其以平價辦法，直接供應市面者，爲量亦頗鉅。又該局近月來依據密報所查獲之物資，分存各處倉庫，爲數不小，昨亦經決定，以其中一部平價出售。</p>
<p>日用物品數量頗鉅</p>
<p>又經濟特派員辦公處接收各工廠之　成品，亦經該處開單，送由審議委員會議決平價分批應市。聞此項物資種類頗多，數量甚鉅，對當前平抑物價工作，預測可獲相當功效。茲探悉其中主要日用品，如菜油·豆油·等油類達八十餘萬市斤。黃豆·蠶豆·。等豆類六十五萬市斤。各種肥皂六千五百餘箱，糖千包左右，布萬餘疋，襪二萬三千打，毛絨綫五萬磅，磁面盆四萬只，香烟二百餘箱，醬油一萬五千市斤，味素類千餘磅，火柴一千五百件，玻璃片一千箱，報紙一千三百捲，洋紙一千七百件。此項物資將由處理局決定辦法，於最近期內，分批供應市面。聞此次所決定平售之日用品，祗佔各方接收物資之一小部份云。</p>
<p>又因國外物資即將大量湧到，需要倉庫甚急，故審議會決定用最迅速方法，騰出倉庫。凡被分配貨品之機關，及承購貨品者，均限於一星期內搬出倉庫，不得延滯。否則另行處理，以期相當數目之倉庫，得以空出云。</p>
<p>積極辦理告密頒獎</p>
<p>敵僞產業處理局，所接各方益增加，均經分別根據報告，詳密緝查，破獲甚多。聞告密給獎，決予迅速發給，分現金寳物兩種，得由密報人具文申請，由處理局酌情辦理。唯申請發給實物獎者，以限於原密報查獲爲限。至給獎數額爲審慎公允起見，將先交該局評價委員會，評定密報破獲產業價格，然後由會計顧問委員會議定給獎。茲誌評價委員會及會計顧問會名單於後：（一）評價委員會主席趙祖康（市府，）委員王世圻（善後救濟總署，）張登義（戰運局，）郁秉堅（市電信局，）凌憲揚·陳彭年·（財政部）桂季桓·高伯凌（經濟部。）（二）會計顧問委員會主席潘序倫，顧問奚玉書·徐永祚等。</p>
<p>封存水汀不得搬移</p>
<p>敵偽產業處理局稱，該局對房屋所有人，請求收回敵僞無償拆移水汀及暖氣設備登記事宜，已着手舉辦。任何機構團體，不得再有任意　移各處封存水汀等件情事，並禁止各商店舊貨攤販，買賣來歷不明之水汀等物。如經發現，即予嚴辦。各所有人可於十日內，將姓名國籍地址，房屋所在地，被移水汀或暖氣設備管子等數量，種類尺寸，及其他足資鑑別之記號，連同所有機證明文件，詳細陳報處理局，儘先查明發還。</p>
<p>小組委會研討辦法</p>
<p>至其餘產權無法確定之水汀及暖氣設備處理問題，昨（六）日敵偽產業審議會已通過，組織小組會研擬辦理。該小組會請由何副市長德奎主持召集，市工務局長趙祖康，警察局長宣鐵吾，處理局長趙傳鼎·陳冠球，法律顧問蔡汝棟等為委員，並邀的英美領事館，及美軍總部隊派員爲顧問，藉作公尤合理之處理。另悉，大部份水汀暖氣設備，已為敵偽遠遷或毀棄。這留者數量有限。加之目前燃煤運輸尙未暢通，煤價高昂，故喛氣設備或將因適應當的環授，先予醫院病房，及盟軍等方面優先應用云</p>

<h3>清算八年血債　敵人罪行登記展期　已登記者三千四百餘件</h3>
<p>與日本淸算上海區內血賬之地方法院檢察處敵人罪行調查室，對敵人罪行登記，原定於昨日截止，但以近數日來前往登記之人民擁擠不堪，每日竟達千餘人之衆，且有於淸晨三時即至蔴華立路檢察署前鵠候啓門者，彼等大部來自吳淞·浦東·楊樹浦鄕間，受敵人八年荼毒壓迫，生命財產之損害，濯髮難數，今得此機會，遂紛至沓來，申訴敵人罪行，並要求淸償。檢察處對辦理此項登記事務人負，原規定僅有三人，旋自五人增至九人，現已有十五人，然自晨迄晚，仍有應接不暇之感。因前往登記者，在市區內之居民，不到百分之五，而百分之九十五爲郊區鄕民，其中又有百分之九十以上爲文盲，其登記之罪行，均須由檢察處接待人員代書，故頗費時間，致每日最多祇能接受登記五百件，截至昨日上午爲止，已登記之敵人罪行，達三千四百八十三件，已取得登記號碼待按號辦理者，尙有一千多件，故地方法院撿察處，於昨日決定將罪行登記展期截止。在全部登記罪行中，以肆意破壞居首位，截至昨午已登記被敵人肆意縱火焚燬之房屋達八千餘棟，其次爲屠殺，第三酷刑姦淫案件，亦約有十數起。</p>

<p>（一）在標售以前，由經濟部駐滬辦事處，先將工廠性質，如機械·化工·紡織分成類別，即由審議會所屬之評議會評定價格，然後始行登報，公開招標。</p>
<p>察看工廠</p>
<p>（二）投標人之標函，須詳塡姓名·住址·並開明標價，經審議會開關標函後，即通知投標人於約定日期，赴其願意標購之工廠察看。各該工廠屆時將再開放三天，便利投標人進入。</p>

<h3>中航民用機　改在龍華降落</h3>

<h3>海軍方面發表　民聯被扣經過</h3>
<p>海軍總司令部駐滬辦事處稱：海軍永安砲艦，近因鎭江附近匪氛猖獗，奉令警戒江面，尤於夜間更加注意。本月二日晚六時，有民生公司民聯船，及旭盈·民裕·商船共三艘，由上游先後駛抵鎭江，不即入港停泊，靠近北岸，致生可疑之形跡。永安艦曾用萬國通語燈號，向民聯船相詢問，歷時三十分鐘，並不置答，始派艇至該船檢查。近船時，復告以係海軍艦艇，而民聯船仍置之不理，竟盲目開槍，擊傷永安艦副長金運凱。送入已接收之日陸軍醫院，經醫生檢騐，係彈穿右腹，剖腸五處，縫連後因流血過多，於本月四日身故。查永安艦曾奉命令警戒江北，檢查可疑船舶。民聯船等船靠泊江北岸，距離較遠，視綫不明，先經以燈號訽問不應，派員檢查，職責願爾，雖喊告以「係海軍船艇毋懼」，而民聯船復不理，竟貿然開放實彈。該派往檢查之金副長，受傷後尙不肯還擊，以免誤傷無辜，增加誤會，處置尙無不當，現竟因傷殞命。聞海軍司令都已提出公文，向長江區復員航運管委會，及民生實業公司，嚴重交涉，查明開槍兇手，依法嚴懲，並賠償一切損失，優卹被害者家屬，以儆不法，而慰幽魂云。</p>

<p>過從甚密</p>
<p>於是外出遊玩及觀劇，朱無不參加，前晚（三日）三人同往大舞台看戲，未及終塲，薛托故外出，孰知其居心險詐，僱車遄回朱寓，將其密藏之銀行保管箱鑰匙及朱義庸私章一枚寫取，約二小時始返戲院，當時朱亦不疑有他，比至五日早晨，朱欲取首飾數件至國際飯店下層四行儲蓄會，迨保管箱開啓後，發覺存貯，屜內之</p>
<p>大批金條</p>
<p>戒數只，金別針，金項鏈，及數百美金票等，均不翼而飛，旋即回家，將家內男女傭人加以偵訊，不得要領，懷疑　國梅偷竊，亦無法佐證，薛且矢口否認，至下午三時朱偕國梅同乘三輪車再往銀行中調查，至大通路愛文義路，薛情虛不願前往，躍軍圖逃，當經朱窺破隱情，乃鳴警將薛拘入新成分局，嚴加盤詰，始直認不諱，經何分局長飭股員黃英傑等馳往界路北站旅社，將某軍人一併拘局訊辦。</p>

<h3>社會服務　破舊法幣換新票</h3>
<p>— 永玉</p>
<p>近來本市常聞有各業拒收稍有破爛之法幣與關金券，使人民對於法幣流通發生阻礙，妨害法幣統一，實在是不合理的事，閱貴報來函欄載：「破損貨幣如何掉換？」茲將所知道者，寫在下面：以作持有破鈔之參考。外灘十五號中央銀行二樓對於一切破舊法幣與關金券，可以換新鈔，不僅掉換中央銀行破損鈔票，即中國交通等其他銀行之破損鈔票，亦由該行掉換新票，每日掉換時間爲上午九時至十二時，下午一時至三時，（每星期六聽說不掉換）我想爲便利各界對法幣流通起見，中央銀行應即函各行莊對於破舊法幣，一律收用，同時金融特派員，應公告各業，對於稍有破舊之法幣，一律通用，不得留難，吾則以妨害法幣罪嚴懲，如此則法幣與關金券可通行無國，而便利各界流通，實非淺鮮。</p>
<h3>英德海戰中卓著戰績　卑爾法斯脫號參觀記</h3>
<p>昨天下午二時四十五分，二十餘個中國記者，由英新聞處負責人帶領出發參觀英皇家海軍旗艦「卑爾法斯脫」號。汽船約走了十幾分鐘，就到達目的地，海軍司令塞凡斯將軍及艦長狄克將軍已在甲板上等候。與記者一一握手，狄克將軍　致辭歡迎各記者，並表示感謝他們被上海人士歡迎之意。</p>
<p>爲了參觀時方便起見，二十多人一共分成四隊，由艦上長官分別領導到各處參觀，我們一隊由希爾頓上尉帶領參觀，有許多地方，水手們都忙着在油漆，艦上有四座砲塔，裝有十二尊六吋口使的大砲，八尊四吋的雙用砲及防空高射砲等。每座砲塔均有特設的砲台來管制，長距離的射程最高可達至九或十英里，砲彈重六十五磅。</p>
<p>走進一問可容一百人的海軍們遊戲室，正有二個小水兵在大跳「吉脫勃」，那邊還可看電影。領航室及司令室內的設備是包羅萬象的，在那裏有各種通話，發信設備，以管轄全艦。此外還有標位指示器，管理一切砲位，魚雷瞄準器等都是裝備得非常精密的。大部的機器，都有一對成平衡施用，艦上凡與於海戰有關的都設有專門部門，畫地圖有地圖室，無綫電室，氣象室，水位測量室等。艦中部有旗台及信號室，一格格的木框內的有各種信旗數十種，此外還放着小船八隻，魚雷三隻。相當舒適的病室內，有病牀十二隻，由軍醫三位擔任治療，此外還專設牙科病房。</p>
<p>到了廚房，艦上不但有好幾個廚房，還有專門的洗菜室，廚子正烤完了包，那種麵包是特大號的，廚子現在已將聖誕節的張樵都準備好了，據說這種蛋糕可保持六月之久，旗艦上的伙食，每日除了供給全艦官兵外，還可供船黃浦中所有小船之用。</p>
<p>從廚房出來，正是四點正，艦上正是下旗，大家都立正，接着就看見甲板上一小隊一小隊在水兵，正在受隊長檢查服裝及點名。士兵們每日分二次上岸，一在下午一時，一在四時，每日輪流換班，在十一時前必須回艦。</p>
<p>艦上還有一部專門設備，就是木匠間，是一間相當大的房間，本匠們正在忙着做傢具。洗衣室內的設備，尤其巧妙，衣服擲在蒸氣機內洗過，放在一旋轉器內，一搖就乾。燙衣服也用機器，二分鐘就可燙好一件襯衫。</p>
<p>看到這時，艦長們就請我們進茶點，在長官的餐應內，陳設都很簡潔安適，同行的人們興緻都很高，我們一隊還忘了參觀機器間吶，雖然比較　些，因爲有機油的關係，可是那裏裝配得多末的精細，濾水器，蒸溜器，每樣都是兩隻的，彎彎曲曲，上上下下我們幾乎找不出出門的地方。</p>
<p>雖然已經到了五點鐘，我們依舊沒來得及參觀全部的裝設，可是已經日落西山，我們也不能不告辭了。雖然我們每個人心裏都很感激艦長們的熱誠招待，但祗能用幾句簡短的話來致謝。狄克將軍還致意答謝，和其他各官員在甲板上送我們，由汽艇重載我們回江畔。</p>

<h3>音樂是生活的泉源</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>音樂的愛好是人類的天性，證之於尙在襁褓中的小孩，便可知道，當他們吵或哭的時候，一經母親抱着，用手拍幾下唱幾隻歌便會立刻停止，有時竟會被催眠的。大一點的孩子們，常喜歡描着臉拿着刀或棒作戲劇的表演，唱歌唱戲是他們唯一的遊戲和娛樂。就是極愚笨的苦力或農夫，他們工作感到煩悶的時候，也知道唱戲或唱歌以求精神的愉快，可見人類對於音樂的興趣是天賦的。</p>
<p>因了這個緣故，音樂在一切籌術中和大衆的關係最爲普遍，和人類生活的關係最為深切。音樂具有一種特殊的力，這個力比任何都偉大，它能够直接地接觸感情，用不着借助於客觀的事物，所以它的效果來得顯著。音樂與生活的關係是這樣的：</p>
<p>用言語傳達意思發表感情，比較文字來得自由而直接，可是發表時，須把思想裝入言語的形式中，換句話講：必需要理性，不能僅用感情發表言語。靑樂則可以不受拘束地直接發表，可以攝移聽者的感情。如漢代的張良竟能以一枝簫的力量，吹散了八千個子弟兵。法國一七九二年大革命的時候，有了黎斯爾（Lisla））作成那首熱情激昂的「馬賽曲」，把義勇軍的士氣鼓舞起來，於是革命得到成功。我們聽着俄國的「伏爾加船夫曲」，會對於勞働者起無限的同情。這種不可理解的力，確是很奇　，它能攝移人們的感情，使自己忘掉了自己，於不知不覺中與音樂的感情相融和。所以用昔樂發表感情是最直接的。</p>
<p>音樂中樂音的進行，有一定的長短，這形式繼續地反覆起來便現出了一種强弱的感覺，即所謂律動。聽了音樂何以會發生快感悲感，這原因完全基於律動的效果。我們的生理現象，如脈膊的跳動，血液的循環，正與音樂的組織一樣，有一定規律的。爲着我們生理的要求，無論耳朶聽聲音，限請看事物，必須要有節拍的與有規律的，感覺上才　意。推而至於每天必需的衣食住，以及精神活動的種種，也都是如此。仰使生活的一切能够養成了律動的習慣，生活便覺豐富而美滿。新生活運動提倡生活要紀律化的目的即在此。所謂紀律化的生活便是者樂的生活，我們要有紀律化的生活，就應該對於音樂有相富的素養，多接觸音樂，多受音樂的陶冶。</p>
<p>飲食是物質的營養，物質的營養固然爲生活需要要而不可。日或少，可是精神上却也需要一種營養。這營養物是什麼呢？便是音樂西洋人以爲平紫倘不攝取高尙的音樂，精神使缺乏營養，與每日不飲食就缺乏體的營養是同樣的。他們視音樂爲精神的食物，工人做工時需要勞工歌以恢復疲勞，兵士行軍時需要軍歌來激發殺敵的勇氣，爲了孩子們作搖籃來催促他們安眠，就是咖啡館餐室也都有音樂的演奏以娛精神。我們常見農夫在田間耕作的時候，口裏唱着山歌，自得其樂。槓抬重物的勞働者呌着「杭育杭育」，好像用這單純的歌聲喚出他們的氣力來工作，反而不覺吃力，這顯然是音樂的效力所致。</p>
<p>音樂與生活的關係是這樣深切，而人類旣然天賦有一種音樂的興趣和才能，我們便應該利用音樂的力，使大衆都有領略音樂的機會，而形成其音樂的生活。</p>

<h3>畫展的勝利</h3>
<p>— 種抱石</p>
<p>××：你那一天到上海？我在讀你的信以前，並不知道，但彷彿有人告我，你是廿七號走的，顧樹森先生來看我的畫展，我問他，他說他曾經送你的行。</p>
<p>我的畫展，承你乘念，非常感激。你記得否，和老舍先生在七星崗天津館吃飯，我酒後曾放言畫展頗有希望，現在托你的福，這次結果，實在應該滿意。勝利以來，此地的畫展，即如陳樹人先生這樣的咸望，也不過如此，我僥倖造了一個紀錄。從來孤冷慣了的人，應該算是難得。計陳列大幅一〇二，册頁五〇，結果大幅的賣去三分之二，册頁二分之一，今日的甫慶不可想像呀！可是也把我累壞了！</p>
<p>我現在又在過瘧疾式的生活，隔一週到中央大學一次，預計明年暑假時可以離此，但我也常常想假如我是一個人，似乎也應該離開「霧」了。但我並不能，而且「勝利」加我的負組，比「抗戰」更重了！我將死下心腸，再作相當時期的「四川人」。</p>
<p>老舍先生和你的信同到，他尙不知我的畫展結果如何？信中多慰我之辭，太可感謝了，他邀我赴北碚一遊，我也想去，然想起北碚已走了一個人，我似乎難說了：聽朋友說：上海「正言報」，也許是「大公報」，有一段重慶通訊記我的畫展，贊揚還是諷刺，全不知道，他說我的畫以二十萬一幅的高價，售賣一空；此事不知眞吾？請便一查，你囑我寫短文章，我有空給你，怕不合式。</p>
<h3>藝術家興起！</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>我族文化在不斷地進展着，藝術實在又是民族文化的先驅。抗戰中大後方的藝術運動並不曾停止，只是在淪陷區，藝人爲了一時的窒息，不願多所表現。可是現在是時候了，尤其是中國新藝術遝動搖籃的上海，我們決不能讓他落寞下去。譬如像藝壇先進劉海粟先生就應當出來領導我們，劉先生年靑時曾把世界最前進的藝術思潮與風格介紹到中國來，後來又把我們固有的民族藝術介紹到國際藝壇。他對中國的藝術運動是有過不朽的貢獻的。他今年已經五十歲了，本來也可以休息了，可是爲了藝術運動，我們不能讓他休息；同探的，一切擱筆的藝術家都應該起來！</p>

<h3>肉食者流</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>老虎吃人，恨不得連皮帶骨都得吞了下去，牠雖然覺得躊躇滿志了，但是牠終於只是講求「肉食者流」中的一「笨坯」！</p>
<p>你想吧！人們在「談虎色變了」，獵戶磨拳擦掌地，「陷阱以伺之，弓箭以施之」，如今的人還加上白朗林　湯姆生」，你想這孽畜牠除一「蟄虎深山」之外，還有生路嗎？否則除了「繳械」以外，還得貢獻給人家一點「虎骨膏」</p>
<p>蚊子和　，牠們就聰明得多了！牠們「肉食」的法子比較「科學化」牠們會　卻渣　而提煉精髓，牠們只吮着人們一點兒「血」。牠們並不像老虎那樣猙獰可怕、蝨呢，牠會一聲不響，像熱練的醫師們打針手術那般敏捷；而蚊子呢！他更聰明了，當牠偷襲的時候，牠還會唱着像「乳娘曲」「搖籃曲」一樣地柔美的「催眠歌」！</p>
<p>當你給蝨或蚊子吮去了一點血的時候，如果祇是一點紅腫呢，「癬疥之疾，何足介意」；如果帶給你一點可怕的傳染病呢，當你病倒的時候，還想用你自已的手，去打自己的嘴吧，埋怨他爲什麼不當心飲食！</p>
<p>你相信嗎？事實俱在，老虎早已銷聲匿跡了，除非只是動物園裏裝在籠子裏的那幾隻隻，而蚊子和蝨却到處在橫行。</p>
<h3>爆竹</h3>
<p>— 朱北海</p>
<p>彷每日兩星期前，市當局有布告，禁止燃放爆竹。大槪是為了「火燭小心」罷！因此，想到八月中旬，上海市民驟然聽到日本投降的消息，無不欣喜欲狂，雖則其時還在敵人勢力壓制之下，可是每一個人的心理，似乎都在躍躍欲試，恨不得立時興起，歡呼鼓舞，以伸慶祝。尤其覺得各人手裏，應該有多量的爆竹，一致燃放，震動全市，方為痛快</p>
<p>直等到最先來的幾位軍政大員，到達了上海，市民纔有機會，燃放爆竹，表示熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>可是中央大員接二連三的光臨上海了爆竹却一聲也不響了，不知道她爲什麼低了頭？</p>
<p>短短的幾十天中，看到爆竹的時運升沈，不禁感慨係之。便畫了一幅爆竹圖。不但筆意簡古，而且彩色繽紛，自覺非常得意。便又抄了淸詩人蔣心餘的爆竹詩於上：</p>
<p>砲力憑金石，憐渠具體微。驚雷一絲引，春雪萬層飛。身碎因狂藥，心長有禍機。不知誰掩耳，還笑盜鈴非。</p>
<h3>水龍吟</h3>
<p>— 吳仞之</p>
<p>因了時代的變遷，常用的語　也就不同了。然而舊詩詞裏却總還依然。曾和幾位朋友談起，想把新字眼嵌進舊詞裏試試，看是如何？這還是念年前的事，當時恰巧有位朋友和我的學生結婚。我的那位朋友是圖畫敎員，我的那位學生是詩詞專家的女兒：當然也是詩詞能手。在理，本是「珠聯璧合」，天生的一對。只因他們是鰥寡結合，所以鄕里的『縉紳們』，『交相詬病』。我偏塡了一首『俚詞』賀之。他們的吉期選在夏天，而那年的夏天特別凉爽，尤其覺得可以代為欣喜。我的詞稿子已遭了兵災，而這首詞却至今還能背得出。默寫下來，也算留個紀念。</p>
<p>人生豈為人生？閒言閒語君休計。俗人之見，是非何辦，習非即是。傳統千年，得來觀念一時難棄。但吾儕行事，胸懷磊落，吾所是，吾行耳。　好是天公休美，甚今年夏凉堪異？炎威潛歛，多情方便。騷人雅緻。蜜月淸遊，湖山領略，畫情詩思。問神仙何似？即如比者，是神仙儷。</p>

        <h1>1945.12.07</h1>
<h3>The National Army Will Smoothly Enter Shenyang; The Communist Troops in the Great Wall Area Flee in Disarray</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 6th, the National Army is driving straight into the southern part of the nine eastern provinces. It has now crossed the Xinmin Military Station, 99 li northwest of Shenyang, and is continuing to advance. General Du Yuming told reporters that he hoped to avoid bloodshed as much as possible and have the National Army arrive in Shenyang within one or two days, so he slowed down the advance. At present, the Soviet army has had a considerable impact on the Communist army, causing them to withdraw from Shenyang, so that the National Army can smoothly enter. The main force of the Communist army along the Beining Road and the Great Wall near Shenyang is now retreating in three directions, reportedly to the territory of Rehe Province and the border of Andong.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] According to a telegram from the Northeast front, the National Army is advancing along the Beining Road and is now only 60 li away from Shenyang, but is unwilling to enter the city hastily before obtaining Soviet consent. Shenyang is still occupied by the Soviet army, but there are no Communist troops in the city. It is reported that the Communist army is now moving towards Harbin and possesses a large number of aircraft. General Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security Force, does not have any aircraft. Before withdrawing from Jinzhou, the Communist army destroyed all the Japanese aircraft there.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] Reports state that the Xinmin-Shenyang section of the Beining Road is generally intact, allowing mechanized units to quickly enter Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] A United Press special correspondent reports that the National Army is eager to leave the best possible impression on the residents of Shenyang, so that the legal army of the Northeast Security Command is truly worthy of the name. Observers believe that General Du's ability to reach Shenyang smoothly is because the Communist Party's guerrilla tactics are no match for General Du's veteran troops. After recognizing this in a battle near Shanhaiguan, the Communist army retreated into the countryside to attack the National Army's long supply lines. In addition, Soviet pressure on the Communist Party has turned Shenyang into a vacuum. General Du is well aware that although his supply lines are far superior to those of the Communist army, he must now pass through a corridor of about 300 li, which is vulnerable to attacks by Communist troops waiting for an opportunity. Therefore, opening up corridors and occupying the cities and towns on both sides is more important than a simple advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 4th] After the National Army entered Jinzhou, it thoroughly cleared the rear transportation lines and advanced in three directions: the northern route has reached Yixian and extended to the west, the central route has passed Goubangzi and is approaching the border of Panxian on the southern route. There are no Communist troops from Shanhaiguan to Suizhong, Jinxi, Jin County, and along the railway line. The Beining passenger train runs every other day to and from Qinhuangdao and has been unobstructed three times.</p>
<h3>Changchun Discussions Underway; Personnel Remaining in Beiping to Return to Work for Takeover</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 6th] Regarding the issue of the National Army being airlifted to Shenyang, it is reported that Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Commissioner for the Northeast, and Marshal Malinovsky, commander of the Soviet occupying forces, are discussing it in Changchun today. Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Changchun on the 4th with Chang Chia-ao, Special Commissioner of the Economic Commission. Malinovsky personally greeted them at the airport and escorted them into the city under Soviet military protection. It is reported that Chang Chia-ao has notified the Northeast Takeover Committee, which is staying in Beiping, that the situation in the Northeast has greatly improved, urging them to prepare to return to Changchun quickly. Deputy Chief of Staff Dong of the Military Affairs Commission's Northeast Headquarters has also made the same guarantee. When most of the personnel taking over the Northeast retreated last month, only General Dong and a small number of representatives of the various offices remained in Changchun, maintaining close contact with the Soviet authorities. It is reported that the situation is peaceful. The people of the Northeast are eager for the National Army to arrive. Xu Zhen, chairman of Liaoning Province, has established a temporary provincial government in Jin County, and will move into the city as soon as the National Army enters Shenyang. This is the first time in fourteen years that officials of the Central Government have resumed administration in the Northeast. It is reported that disturbances have recently occurred in Shenyang, but the reason is unknown. The director of the Northeast Security Command's Beiping office recently returned from Jin County and stated that the approximately 70,000 to 80,000 troops of the Communist armies of Li Yongchang and Liu Biao have split into small groups and are scattered between the Great Wall and Jin County. 20,000 have entered Rehe Province, and 7,000 to 8,000 have been captured by the National Army. Rumors that 20,000 Communist troops in the Northeast have been killed have not been confirmed by eyewitnesses or other reports. Li's troops entered the Northeast in mid-August of this year and were responsible for occupying Rehe and Liaoning provinces.</p>
<h3>Liang Han-tsao Returns to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Negotiations with the Kazakhs in Xinjiang are Expected to Conclude Within Two Weeks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Liang Han-tsao flew from Dihua and arrived in Chongqing at 12:00 on the 5th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Liang Han-tsao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, announced today after returning to Chongqing from Xinjiang that negotiations between the central government and the Kazakhs in Xinjiang are expected to conclude within two weeks, and the various issues that have long hindered the peaceful governance of the Hui people will no longer exist. Liang revealed that central government personnel have held three meetings with representatives of the Kazakhs, seeking to grant the Kazakhs a high degree of autonomy. They have now agreed to the following points: (1) The heads of Kazakh districts and counties will be elected by the people; (2) Free trade will be allowed between the Han and Kazakh people; (3) The Kazakh army will be effectively maintained; (4) Trade between the Kazakhs in Xinjiang and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic will still be subject to international trade regulations. Liang said that the Soviet consul general in Dihua has made great efforts to mediate in the negotiations over the past two months.</p>
<h3>The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee Will Be Held Tomorrow; The Political Consultative Council Will Convene in February</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report, Chongqing, 6th] It has been reliably learned that the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee will be held in January, and the Political Consultative Council will convene in early February.</p>
<h3>U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall May Arrive in China Around the 20th</h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief He Will Meet Him in Shanghai or Chongqing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin revealed at a press conference on the 6th, in response to inquiries, that the newly appointed U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, may arrive in China around the 20th, and he will meet with him in Shanghai or Chongqing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Well-informed sources in Chinese diplomatic circles say that regarding the U.S. policy toward China, it is still hoped that both the Nationalists and the Communists can achieve unity under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. It is said that President Truman also has this instruction for the new U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall. They have prepared to welcome Marshall. [Reuters, Washington, 6th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that General Marshall has been summoned to testify before the Senate Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee on the 6th, and will depart for China immediately after his testimony is completed to carry out a special mission for President Truman.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Former Army Chief of Staff and U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshall, testified today before the Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee, stating briefly that before the Pearl Harbor attack, there was no United Nations staff meeting that led the United States to war, except as a result of an attack in the Pacific. He personally participated in meetings of U.S., British, Canadian, and Dutch officials.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party Instigated Unemployed Soldiers to Throw Bombs at the National United University Normal College; The Truth About the Hand Grenade Case in Kunming is Revealed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Two hundred professors from various universities in Kunming have begun a week-long strike yesterday to express their condolences for the students who died in the hand grenade tragedy, in support of the hand grenade tragedy. It is alleged that the unemployed soldiers were instigated by the Communist Party to throw the bombs and received 30,000 Legal Tender in compensation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 5th] The public trial of the National United University hand grenade incident and related cases in the city was held yesterday. There were a total of three cases, the third case being the most important, and the first two cases being relatively simple. The first case involved three students from the Officers' Corps assaulting students from Yunnan University on Zhengyi Road on November 30. The investigation revealed that students were posting slogans on the road, and a few students went to tear them down, resulting in a conflict. The Officers' Corps student Zhou Haiquan and others went to mediate, which led to an argument and they were assaulted. Yunnan University sent representatives to apologize the next day. The second case was the assault between Officers' Corps students from the Faculty of Arts and Law of the National United University and students on December 1. The investigation revealed that a group of students from the Officers' Corps were traveling to Daguanlou and were stoned by students outside the National United University, which led to a conflict. At that time, a hand grenade was thrown from inside the school, injuring only one Officers' Corps student, and no students were injured. The third case was the hand grenade incident at the National United University Normal College. Because this case resulted in student deaths and injuries, and the circumstances were serious, the interrogation was more detailed. The confessions of the main culprits in the third case are excerpted as follows: The grenade throwers Chen Qida and Liu Youzhi were brought in for interrogation. The military judge first asked Chen Qida about his place of origin and name. Chen Qida confessed that his original name was Chen Dongsheng, he was 38 years old, from Hengyang, Hunan, and had served as a deputy battalion commander. He became redundant in March of this year and started a small business in Kunming. The military judge asked: Did you go to the Normal College on December 1? He answered: That day, when I passed Daxi Men, there were many people, so I went to see what was happening. The judge asked: Why did you throw the hand grenade? He answered: I didn't throw anything at all. The judge asked: Someone has already seen you throw it with their own eyes, you must tell the truth. He answered: It wasn't my own idea to go. There was a man in his twenties who often drank tea with me in the teahouse. When I was drinking tea, I complained, and he came to me and said, "You work for the Kuomintang army, but they don't mean anything. They are all warlords, of course, you are working for them for nothing." He said, "Now I want you to do something that will bring you money and an official position." He told me to meet him on the side of Yunhuachi Road outside the North Gate on the night of the 30th. That night, he gave me 30,000 yuan and promised to introduce me to be the commander of a detachment, as long as I obeyed his command. At that time, we agreed to meet outside the North Gate at 9:00 a.m. on December 1. On that day, I went as agreed, and he took me to the Normal College outside the West Gate. When he saw many people gathered at the entrance, he said, "This is when you obey me and do things." He gave me two hand grenades and told me to throw them into the crowd there. After I took them, he walked away. At this time, I was wandering on the road, and it happened that a familiar friend, Liu Youzhi, came. He was in the same situation as me, so I called him and asked him to throw one too, and promised to give him 10,000 yuan. The judge asked: What is the name of this person you met in the teahouse, where does he live, and what is his name? He answered: He didn't tell me his address, he said his name was Mei Kai. The judge asked: When he gave you the hand grenade, did he say anything else to you? He answered: He agreed to meet me at Cuihu that night. The judge asked: How did you throw the hand grenade? He answered: At that time, I saw forty or fifty people crowding into the Normal College, and I followed Liu Youzhi all the way in. I saw people tearing down slogans and hitting slogan boards. There was a quarrel inside, and many people were running outside, and many students were chasing behind, throwing stones and mud. I thought the time had come, and I hurriedly threw a hand grenade. Immediately, the crowd ran in panic, and I ran away. After only a few steps, I heard another explosion, probably Liu Youzhi threw it. The judge asked: How did you get to know Liu Youzhi? He answered: I got to know him on the road when I was running my business. The judge asked: After you threw the hand grenade, did you meet Jiang Kai at Cuihu? He answered: I went, but he didn't come. The judge asked: Where were you caught? He answered: Because I didn't see Jiang Kai, I thought of going to Qujing. The next day, I went to the station and ran into Liu Youzhi again. He asked me for money. Because I didn't have much money on me, I only gave him a few thousand yuan. He was unwilling and quarreled with me, and the plainclothes police found out and arrested us together at the station. The military judge then questioned Liu Youzhi, who confessed that he was 32 years old, from Pujiang, Zhejiang, and had served as an adjutant in the Guizhou Security Office. After leaving his job in November of last year, he started a small business. The judge asked: Where do you live? He answered: I often run to Qujing and Zhan Yi, I don't have a fixed address. The judge asked: How did you get to know Chen Qida? He answered: I met him on the road when I was running my business. The judge asked: Who did you go to the Normal College with on December 1? He answered: I went out to play, and met Chen Qida outside Daxi Men. He said to me, "Now you don't have any money, I want you to help me do something. The students over there are in conflict. You help me throw a hand grenade and I will pay you 10,000 yuan." The judge asked: When did you throw it? He answered: After I heard an explosion, I threw it.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief He Announced Yesterday That the Japanese Army's Disarmament Was Completed Ahead of Schedule; Delays in a Few Areas Due to Communist Interference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Commander-in-Chief He held a press conference at 3:00 p.m. on the 6th, which was He's first conference before his return after being away from Nanjing for two months. Chief of Staff Xiao Su and others attended. He declared that, based on the recent reports on the progress of the Japanese army's disarmament in various places, it is clearly faster than expected (four to six months). As of now, 25 of the 35 Japanese divisions in China have completed disarmament, eight are in the process of disarmament, and only two remain to be disarmed. Among the 41 independent brigades, 24 have been disarmed, six are in the process of disarmament, and of the 20 other independent guard teams and detachments, 13 have been disarmed and three are in the process of disarmament. As for the five special forces units, only one remains to be disarmed. He continued, if counted by war zone and region, the disarmament of the Japanese army in various places, the 1st and 2nd Front Armies, and the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th War Zones have all been completed. However, in the 3rd Front Army's Subei, the 10th War Zone's Haizhou, the 11th War Zone's Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and the 2nd War Zone's Pingyao and Qinxian, the disarmament was delayed because the Communist army destroyed transportation, and the National Army could not arrive at the designated location as scheduled, but the National Army is advancing at full speed. He declared that if the Communist army does not interfere further, the disarmament can be completed in December.</p>
<p>Transporting Japanese Prisoners and Overseas Chinese Is a Current Difficulty</p>
<p>Regarding the centralized management and transport of surrendered Japanese soldiers and Japanese expatriates back to their country, He believes that the problem is very large. There are about 1.3 million Japanese soldiers and about 470,000 Japanese expatriates in China, plus 400,000 Japanese expatriates in Taiwan, totaling more than 1.8 million. China lacks ships, so the transport of prisoners and expatriates back to their country has to be assisted by allied nations. The prisoners and expatriates are scattered throughout the recovered areas, and inland transportation has been largely destroyed by the Communist army, so whether they can reach the port on schedule is also a problem. However, He pointed out that since November 15, the United States has decided to use 107 landing craft and 7 seized Japanese transport ships to start transporting them in succession, and as of now, it has been reported that 61,000 have been transported out. As for management, He said that Japanese expatriate management offices and branches have been established in various places, not only to strictly restrict their activities but also to correct and reform their past erroneous ideas. The use of prisoner and expatriate labor is also actively underway.</p>
<p>There Should Be No Problem with Taking Over the Nine Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>After listening to He's report, more than 30 reporters asked questions one after another, like thirsty people seeking a drink. However, in general, the first question was about the takeover of the nine eastern provinces. He believes that there "should be no problem" with taking over the Northeast, because the Soviet Union has kept its word in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and what remains is an internal problem of our country. At present, the Communist army is causing disturbances in various passes of the Great Wall, causing the National Army's takeover of the Northeast to be delayed again and again. He confirmed that the National Army was airlifted to Changchun, but explained that as of the report received on the 6th, only the airport ground staff had arrived in Changchun. He refused to confirm the rumor that the National Army had entered Shenyang.</p>
<p>Communist Army's Harassment Is Most Serious in Southern Shandong</p>
<p>Regarding the Communist army's harassment in various places, He pointed out that the most serious area at present is southern Shandong. Since the 24th of last month, Lincheng, Zaozhuang, Hanzhuang, Shagou, and other places have been attacked by the Communist army. They are clearly aimed at destroying the local coal mines. Although Hanzhuang and Shagou have fallen, the National Army is determined to advance forward to restore transportation and production in accordance with the Central Government's intention to truly liberate the people of southern Shandong from their suffering. The situation in the border areas of Subei and Hubei and Anhui has recently improved slightly. In addition, He also said that he did not participate in the Central Government's negotiations with the Communist Party in Chongqing, so he did not know the details, but he personally hoped that the Political Consultative Conference could be held smoothly, because peaceful unification is a consistent policy of the Central Government. Regarding the so-called civil war, "as long as the Communist army stops attacking, there will be no civil war."</p>
<p>The National Army Has Eliminated More Than Eighty Divisions</p>
<p>When reporters inquired about the recent situation of military reorganization, He said that as of October of this year, the National Army had eliminated more than 80 divisions, and the first stage of the planned program can be said to have been completed. However, the realization of the entire plan depends on how the Communist army problem evolves. He continued that the production of light weapons in our country is no longer a problem. The mission of the future U.S. military advisory group is to assist in the education and construction work of the National Army. All of this is good news for the future of military construction. As for my inspection of Taiwan, there is no fixed date at present.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Huang Fu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The National Government issued an order on the 6th to commend Huang Fu. In addition to recording his life achievements in the National History Museum for biographical writing, the local memorial hall in his hometown will be investigated, repaired, and properly maintained by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to show the government's sincere remembrance of loyalty and nothing can be added to it.</p>
<h3>The Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Be Temporarily Replaced by Cheng Ximeng; Chen Guolian Will Go to Shanghai to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Zhang Zhongfu, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has resigned, and Cheng Ximeng will temporarily replace him. Wu Aichen, Special Commissioner for Sichuan and Xikang, has recently been transferred to be Special Commissioner for Peiping and Tianjin. Chen Guolian, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, took a plane to take office on the 6th. Chiang Chia-tung, Consul General in Batavia, is scheduled to leave Chongqing for his post on the 15th. Gu Zhaofen, Consul in Madagascar, has already taken office.</p>
<h3>Hurley Publicly Stated The Process of Acheson and Others Harboring Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] Hurley's testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday is of great concern here and is being discussed. However, the Communist side refused to comment and only continued to criticize the U.S. troops stationed in China, demanding their withdrawal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Former U.S. Ambassador to China Major General Hurley told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that the reason he disregarded the State Department's instructions was to facilitate the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Hurley also revealed that he opposed providing the Chinese Communist Party with Lend-Lease weapons and equipment, and accused two former U.S. diplomats stationed in Chongqing of secretly undermining his position. The two diplomats were Service and Acheson, who later became political advisors to General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan. Hurley also said that Service was a cunning diplomat who was originally assigned to work with General Stilwell in China. In October 1944, he submitted a "report allowing the National Government to collapse" to the State Department. Acheson repeatedly advocated supplying the Communist army with Lend-Lease goods to secretly undermine his position. After Washington recalled Service and Acheson this spring in response to his protest, Acheson was placed under his supervision. After talking with the British Prime Minister (Churchill), Foreign Secretary (Eden), and Soviet officials in Moscow, he sought to mediate between Chongqing and Moscow. However, the State Department instructed him "not to mediate or advise, but only to provide suggestions." This instruction was contained in a telegram signed by then-U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius. He ignored it because he believed that it contradicted his understanding of the instructions to promote China's unity and was therefore a misguided move. He believed that the Soviet Union fully agreed with the U.S. policy toward China and believed that the Soviet Union would abide by the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in August. Hurley then denied that he was arbitrarily implementing personal policies in China to replace the work of the Washington government, saying that he had recently spoken with Communist leaders in Yan'an, advising them of the United States' desire for a political reconciliation between the various parties in China. He had some hope of success. At that time, Mao Zedong told him that the United States had a plan to "establish a Japanese empire under control as a stable force in Asia." When Mao Zedong believed that Acheson and Service had been appointed as MacArthur's political advisors, it proved that the United States had this intention, and the negotiations collapsed.</p>
<h3>The First Roundups of Traitors in Beiping and Tianjin; Wang Yintai and 240 Others Arrested; Nanjing to Try Traitor Cases Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 6th] Last night and this morning, Beiping conducted its first large-scale roundup of traitors, with approximately 240 people arrested. While there is no official confirmation, it is widely believed that Wang Yintai, former chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, along with Wang Kemin and Wang Yitang, are among those arrested. The Beiping Garrison Headquarters is carrying out this operation. While there has been no official announcement regarding the arrest of traitors, it is confirmed that two former mayors of the puppet Beiping Municipal Government have been detained.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] Approximately one hundred traitors were arrested within five hours on the morning of the 6th, marking the beginning of the purge of traitors in the north. The authorities declined to release the names of those arrested but confirmed that Qi Bian Yuanye, one of the former key figures of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, has been arrested. Those also arrested include several former puppet mayors of Beiping and Tianjin, Qiu Yutang, an economic traitor who once served as chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, Wang Hefang, former manager of the Hebei Provincial Bank, and several cultural traitors.</p>
<p>[Shanghai News Agency, Nanjing] According to sources at the High Court, a large group of traitors, numbering over two hundred, have been arrested in Nanjing. After being transferred to the court by the Chinese Army Headquarters, they have been detained at No. 125 Ninghai Road. Now that the National Government's regulations for punishing traitors have been promulgated for several days, and the people are eager for the major national traitors to be brought to justice and tried, the court is prepared to commence trials starting next week. The Jiangsu High Court, recognizing the significance of the matter, has decided to send several senior administrative personnel to Nanjing to assist in the proceedings. It is also reported that the first batch of traitors to be tried will include Chen Gongbo, as well as Mei Siping, Cen Deguang, Li Shengwu, Li Ouyi, Zhou Xuechang, and Guo Xiufeng.</p>
<h3>National Government Re-issues Regulations for Punishing Traitors (Continued)</h3>
<p>Article 3: Those who have served in puppet organizations or their affiliated agencies and groups, relying on enemy and puppet forces to act in ways beneficial to the enemy or detrimental to the country or its people, and whose actions are not already covered in the categories listed in Article 2, shall be punished in accordance with Article 2, Section 1.</p>
<p>Article 4: Attempted violations of the preceding two articles shall be punished.</p>
<p>Article 5: Those who prepare or conspire to commit the crimes in Article 2 shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than seven years.</p>
<p>Article 6: Those who knowingly harbor traitors without reporting them, or who provide shelter or condone their actions, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than seven years.</p>
<p>Article 7: Those who deliberately frame or falsely accuse others of crimes under these regulations shall be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Article 8: Those who commit the crime in Article 2, Section 1, shall have all of their property confiscated. If the offenders in the preceding clause have not been apprehended, the National Government may issue a warrant for their arrest, and if the evidence of their guilt is certain, a separate declaration may be issued to confiscate all of their property. If the offenders in the first clause have not been apprehended, but the evidence of their guilt is certain, the agencies authorized to conduct investigations may request approval from the Executive Yuan to first seal all or part of their property. If the case involves military personnel, the request shall be submitted to the highest military authority for approval. The National Government must be notified immediately after the property mentioned above is sealed, so that an arrest warrant can be issued. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Editorial: Swiftly and Strictly Punish Traitors</h3>
<p>The enemy's surrender has passed for over three months, and all measures are being actively implemented. However, it is regrettable that until recently, we have only seen the arrest of traitors reported in the newspapers occasionally or frequently, but we have not seen any legal proceedings against them. Recently, the Shanghai court held a public trial of a traitor case, but the first person to be tried in this way was merely a minor traitor who had served as an inspector in the puppet Ministry of Interior, and even now, there has been no final verdict. In addition, another publicly tried traitor case involved a foreman who had served as an interpreter for the enemy and a traitor who had served as a legislator in the puppet Legislative Yuan. At the same time, according to those in charge of the judicial organs, the judges handling the trial of traitor cases all reside in the court to avoid contact with the outside world and prevent being subjected to [illegible]. It is also said that the Shanghai High Court currently has only about twenty traitor cases pending trial; according to this newspaper's exclusive interview yesterday, the number of traitors awaiting trial is one hundred and two, who will be interrogated in batches of twenty. All of this inevitably makes us concerned again.</p>
<p>We find it strange that the number of traitor cases awaiting trial in the Shanghai High Court is shockingly small. In such a large city as Shanghai, a place where traitors used to gather, with all kinds of collaborators who had engaged in treason, the number of traitor cases awaiting trial in the High Court is only this small up to now. Of course, many cases have not yet been submitted to the court for investigation and prosecution. But for the court to have accepted such a small number of traitor cases awaiting trial in the past three months is truly astonishing. According to the regulations for punishing traitors and handling traitor cases promulgated by the National Government, officials of puppet organizations above the rank of Simplified Appointment and the heads of Recommended Appointment agencies must be punished. Even based on this alone, the number of traitor cases should not be limited to the few currently awaiting trial in the court. Furthermore, according to the aforementioned regulations, except for military personnel, the trial of traitor cases falls under the jurisdiction of the courts, with the High Court as the court of first instance. Thus, the number of traitor cases that should be tried by the courts should be quite considerable; why is the number of traitor cases currently awaiting trial in the court so pathetically small? We also find it strange that, according to those in charge of the judicial organs, the judges handling the trial of traitor cases all reside in the court to avoid contact with the outside world. The presentation of this statement undermines the dignity of the judges and the dignity of the court. A judge's impartiality and integrity are not determined by whether their residence is within the court, and avoiding contact with the outside world does not necessarily require living within the court. Even if one lives within the court, it is still impossible to avoid contact with the outside world if one wants to. Moreover, contact with the outside world is one thing, and firmness in judgment is another.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the handling of traitor cases, we cannot help but offer a few suggestions:</p>
<p>First, the handling of traitor cases is a matter of utmost concern to the people; delays in the proceedings can only dampen public morale. After Mussolini was captured by the people's armed forces in northern Italy, he was immediately executed. Although this was momentarily gratifying, it was ultimately not in accordance with the law. When handling traitor cases, we must ensure that everything is in accordance with the law and adjudicated according to legal procedures in order to uplift morale. The nation's legislation on handling traitors is based on leniency, but behind the "leniency in legislation" lies the profound meaning of "strictness in enforcement." Matters not specified in the regulations should not be arbitrarily prosecuted, while those clearly stipulated should be arrested, reported, and strictly handled by the courts in accordance with the law. Traitors apprehended by the army or other parties, except for those who can be subject to military trial according to the law, should be promptly transferred to the courts for trial, and should not be kept in detention indefinitely.</p>
<p>Second, while traitors may have different statuses, they are all traitors to the country. Therefore, when trying traitor cases, minor traitors should be tried by the High Court, and major traitors should also be tried publicly by the High Court in accordance with the law. Recently, we have seen the arrest of major traitors such as Zhou Fohai, Chen Gongbo, and Chu Minyi, but to this day, we have not seen their public trial. Although we know that all traitors, big and small, will be punished as they deserve, the delay in the trial still casts a shadow in the minds of the people.</p>
<p>Third, the handling of traitor cases should be swift. It has been two or three months since the arrest of traitors, big and small. These traitors can be said to be individuals whose treasonous acts are well-known, and they should be tried and punished immediately after their arrest in accordance with the law. Even if investigation or reporting is necessary, two or three months should be sufficient, and further delays cannot be tolerated. While traitors who have already been captured should be dealt with swiftly, traitors who are captured in the future should also be tried publicly as soon as possible after their capture.</p>
<p>Fourth, the strict arrest of traitors across all regions and the continued publication of their names are also essential tasks for the present. According to the items listed in Article 2 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, although the intention of leniency in legislation is not to delve deeply into other collaborators, the number of traitors who clearly fall under the various clauses of that article should be considerable, given the spirit of strict enforcement. After the restoration of power in France, the De Gaulle government dealt with over 400,000 cases of "French traitors"; in Belgium, 50,000 "Belgian traitors" were punished. The enemy occupied our country for eight years, during which the number of traitors of all sizes who met the criteria stipulated in the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases must have numbered in the thousands or tens of thousands. However, since the restoration of our territory, the list of traitors we have seen captured is extremely meager. Among these few captured traitors, there are twenty awaiting trial in the Shanghai Supreme Court, or one hundred and two as reported by this newspaper. Whether it is twenty or one hundred and two, these numbers do not meet the expectations of the people. This is not to say that we are not making efforts to arrest traitors, but it is enough to remind us that our efforts in this area still need to be intensified. Marshal MacArthur has already captured 318 war criminals in Japan, and the number of traitors we have captured seems somewhat inadequate compared to this number. We should swiftly and strictly arrest the traitors who are still at large, continue to publish their names to inform the public. Furthermore, this approach has an additional benefit: it can provide the people in the occupied areas during the past eight years with a clear answer as to who is a traitor and who is suspected, so as to avoid indiscriminate arrests, a state of general insecurity, and the occurrence of many abuses.</p>
<p>In summary, the swift and strict handling of traitor cases is not just a matter of upholding laws and regulations; the revitalization and decline of the people's hearts, the maintenance and collapse of morality and justice, all hinge on this. Pétain held the rank of Marshal of France, and figures like Laval and Quisling also held important positions. They can now be subject to the sanctions of national law. But in our country, the major traitors and evildoers who collaborated with the enemy have not yet been brought to justice under national law, which has a significant impact on domestic morale and international perceptions. Therefore, we call for the swift and strict handling of traitor cases.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Signed Economic Agreement in Washington Yesterday; US Lends Britain $4.4 Billion for Reconstruction Assistance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Anglo-American loan agreement was signed this morning in Washington. After twelve weeks of negotiations in Washington, Britain can now obtain a loan of $4.4 billion from the United States. After the negotiating parties on both sides finalized the details, they agreed on the loan terms last night. It is widely believed that the official announcement will be made tonight, and Prime Minister Attlee may also announce the outcome of the negotiations at the House of Commons meeting today. The British delegation will now proceed to Ottawa to negotiate credit loans with Canada. Sources in Washington say that Britain intends to borrow approximately £93 million from Canada.</p>
<p>[Reuters Special Correspondent, Bu Shu, Washington, 6th] The United States has agreed to lend Britain $4.4 billion, of which $3.75 billion is a credit loan for trade, and $650 million is for the final settlement of Lend-Lease items currently in the United Kingdom. Britain has agreed to abolish the Sterling Area exchange controls one year after the loan is approved. This historic agreement will revitalize Britain's war-torn economy.</p>
<h3>Truman and Attlee Issue Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>[Reuters Special Correspondent, Bu Shu, Washington, 6th] British Prime Minister Attlee and U.S. President Truman issued a joint statement announcing the Anglo-American loan agreement, stating that the trade objectives of Britain and the United States are to expand the common goals of multilateral trade. The agreement enables the first common signal of equal rules governing international trade policies and relations to be realized.</p>
<p>The loan bears interest at 2%, repayable over 50 years starting December 31, 1951. Undersecretary of State Clayton stated that the total amount repaid by Britain would be $5.9625 billion. Britain may be exempted from paying interest in any year if its foreign exchange equalization account is deemed insufficient. Britain has agreed that within twelve months after the agreement comes into effect, all unblocked Sterling Area balances may be used for any currency and trade transactions. This agreement must be approved by both the British and American Parliaments. Clayton told reporters that the British had originally intended to borrow more, but he felt that this amount was enough to satisfy them. This loan is very beneficial to trade, and multilateral trade can be restored with its help.</p>
<p>Expanding World Trade and Establishing a Monetary System</p>
<p>While issuing the agreement, the U.S. State Department also issued a white paper to countries around the world, offering suggestions for expanding world trade. The joint declaration by Attlee and Truman stated that both Britain and the United States have always felt that establishing a world trade and monetary system, so that trade between countries can be conducted on a multilateral and consistent basis, is in the interest of both the British and American governments. The negotiations have been very smooth, leading to the conclusion of the agreement, in which the United States lends the United Kingdom $3,775,000,000 to facilitate the United Kingdom's purchase of American goods, assist the United Kingdom in coping with foreign exchange imbalances during the post-war transition period, help the United Kingdom maintain adequate gold and foreign exchange reserves, and assist it in shouldering the responsibilities of multilateral trade. This loan will enable the United Kingdom to reduce import trade and foreign exchange controls, so as to progress with other countries towards the common goal of expanding multilateral trade. The declaration also stated that $650,000,000 of the loan has already been lent to the United Kingdom to pay for the value of Lend-Lease items now within the country, which is the final and complete settlement. The United Kingdom, by paying for Lend-Lease items, obtains surplus assets, and the total amount owed by the United Kingdom to the United States for all equipment and other items within the United Kingdom is $650,000,000.</p>
<p>U.S. Suggests Countries Remove Trade Restrictions</p>
<p>As for the white paper submitted by the U.S. State Department to various countries, its suggestions include the following: (1) Revoking government-issued restrictions: governments should use their authority to revoke regulations that excessively restrict free trade. (2) Revoking restrictions issued by private industrial and commercial associations and trusts: it is suggested that a special agency be established under the International Trade Organization to receive complaints from all parties regarding various restrictions imposed by international industrial and commercial associations and trusts, and opinions on how to remedy them. (3) Preventing disruptions in major commodity markets: this matter should be addressed through mutual exchange of views between governments. (4) Preventing irregular states of production and distribution: countries should hold conferences and form general agreements, stipulating that a country will maintain sufficient and regular production, and avoid using methods that could harm other countries or hinder the expansion of world trade. (5) Establishing an international trade organization: formulating a charter similar to that of other United Nations agencies to regulate trade barriers, commercial restrictions, international commodity exchanges, etc.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Also Plans to Borrow Large Sums of Money from the U.S., Around $6 Billion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Sources in Moscow expect that once the Anglo-American loan talks are completed, Washington will consider granting the Soviet Union a large line of credit, amounting to around $6 billion. According to American sources, a U.S. committee on economic policy and planning, whose members recently met with Stalin in Moscow, reportedly mentioned the credit line, and Stalin was "extremely interested" in it.</p>

<h3>Christmas Approaching, U.S. Peacetime Production Not Yet Recovered, Precious Gifts Difficult to Obtain</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 6th] Although the war in the United States has now ended, production has not yet recovered. The Christmas holiday is approaching, but precious Christmas gifts are still scarce and difficult to obtain. Whether rationed or non-rationed items, a sufficient supply will not be available until the beginning of next year. The following items are currently in the highest demand: (1) Automobiles: although they are no longer rationed, it will be difficult to buy them this year. The list of those registered to buy new cars is already miles long. (2) Men's clothing industry: almost completely suspended for wartime needs, tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers are still wearing uniforms, waiting for new clothes to be replaced. (3) Nylon rayon: American women must crowd in front of special sale counters to buy this high-quality silk stockings before the beginning of next year. (4) Housing: hotels are always full, and those who make reservations must wait several weeks to fill the vacancy. There is no sign of relaxation yet. In New York, if there is an apartment or spare room for rent, the door will be worn through by those who inquire. (5) Refrigerators: they are already being manufactured and assembled. There are many who deal in this, similar to car brokers. (6) Electrical appliances: manufacturers hope to quickly produce toasters, broilers, blenders, etc., for the market. (7) Carpet sweepers: New York stores are displaying this appliance for sale for the first time since the end of 1941. Suburban housewives can no longer bend down to the ground to sweep and clean carpets. However, stores in downtown New York still have other sufficient goods to meet the needs of Christmas, and a prosperous business can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Historical Documents of Sino-British Commerce: Letter from James I to the Chinese Emperor, Ye Gongchao Presents It to the British United Aid to China Fund</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 6th] The British United Aid to China Fund has become the custodian of a historical document closely linked to Sino-British relations, thanks to Mr. Ye Gongchao, Director of the London Office of the Chinese Ministry of Information. The document is a letter from King James I to the Chinese Emperor, which has been presented to the Fund by Mr. Ye Gongchao. The letter is written on parchment paper, decorated with lace, symbolizing "the willingness of the subjects of the British Empire to travel across the ocean to China to trade with the people of your country, and the hope that this request will be granted." The letter was issued on February 7, 1613, and Sino-British commercial relations were initiated by Mr. Cox of the East India Company in 1615.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Arrest of Konoe and Kido</h3>
<p>The Emperor's Problem Has Become the Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] Konoe Fumimaro, who served as prime minister three times, has been ordered arrested by MacArthur today. Also on the list are Marquis Kido, who was the Emperor's right-hand man during the war, and seven other war criminals, including Vice Admiral Uto, the unofficial special envoy sent to Germany to explain the China Incident, political economist O, Ogata, the vice president of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Viscount Okouchi, a prominent businessman, Oshima, the former Japanese ambassador to Germany (who was repatriated from the United States today with other Japanese residents), Sakai, a member of the House of Peers, and Suma, an official at the Japanese embassy in the United States. Konoe had previously requested permission from the Imperial Household to become a commoner and is currently planning a new constitution for Japan after the occupation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] The news that MacArthur ordered the arrest of Konoe and six other leaders has greatly surprised the Japanese political world. There are also rumors that the Shidehara Cabinet is on the verge of collapse. Cabinet ministers, when speaking to reporters, denied the existence of this crisis but admitted that there might be changes in the government structure.</p>
<p>[United Press, 5th] Whether Emperor Hirohito helped promote the Japanese war and whether he should abdicate - these two sensitive issues have been revealed today. Once answered, they will change Japan's future. Tanaka, a neutral member of parliament, asked the government for its opinion on the Emperor's abdication. Tanaka also said that since Konoe discussed the matter with foreign reporters, some parties believe that the Emperor's abdication is possible. Privy Councilor Matsumoto replied that publicly discussing the Emperor's abdication is too dreadful, but those who hold such "erroneous" views are not exempt. The same shock was caused when discussing whether the Emperor helped promote the Japanese war. At that time, the Emperor was meeting with the Privy Council to decide on submitting a proposal to the Japanese parliament to revoke the titles and decorations of war criminals.</p>

<h3>United Nations Opposes Colonial Rule by Overwhelming Majority; Our Representative Supports Soviet Proposal</h3>
<p>New Organization Takes Over the League of Nations' Drug Control Work</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] The technical committee of the United Nations organization, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, today overwhelmingly opposed colonial rule and eliminated the originally proposed restrictions on colonial peoples submitting requests to the Trusteeship Council. Britain, Belgium, and South Africa were the main opponents of the Ukrainian and Soviet proposals. The United States abstained from voting on this important issue. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo also supported the removal of all restrictions on making requests. He said: "The Trusteeship Council may consider certain wording insulting, but from the perspective of the petitioners, it may be very ordinary and reasonable. We must adopt a lenient attitude towards colonial peoples and give them the opportunity to express their hidden pain."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The Preparatory Commission of the United Nations has agreed that the Economic and Social Council of this new world organization will continue to take over the work of the old League of Nations' Opium Committee.</p>

Before the government officially announces the handling measures, all schools shall not employ them. However, in order to take into account the actual needs, the Ministry of Education may consider the situation and conscript a small number of special technical professors to give them the opportunity to participate in the work. He also said that the same methods will be adopted for overseas Chinese in enemy countries such as Germany and Japan. As for the students who were sent to Japan to study during the puppet regime, after returning to China, they will be dealt with in the same way as the domestic puppet school students.</p>

<h3>Be an Uncompromising Example, Ensure a Clean Reputation, Said Fu Sinian, Acting President of Peking University</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Chongqing Airmail] Mr. Fu Sinian, the acting president of Peking University, recently told reporters:</p>
<p>Peking University Is Not Related</p>
<p>(1) Institutions above junior college must set an uncompromising example for the next generation of young people in terms of the four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. Peking University originally asked all teachers to move inland. In fact, except for Zhou Zuoren and a few others, the few teachers who did not move inland also transferred to Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University to teach. Qian Daosun, the founder of the puppet Peking University, was not a professor at Peking University. Therefore, the professors of the puppet Peking University have nothing to do with Peking University.</p>
<p>No Appointment Letters Issued</p>
<p>(2) Minister Zhu once told me that there is no such thing as all the staff of the puppet Peking University being hired by the supplementary classes. Only a few were transferred to serve in accordance with the measures of the Army Headquarters for requisitioning enemy and puppet personnel. No appointment letters were issued, and it has nothing to do with Peking University.</p>
<p>Agreement of Opinion</p>
<p>(3) From the perspective of the overall situation, the opinions of Jiang Menglin, the former president of the school, Hu Shi, the president who will return to China next spring, as well as the Peking University faculty group, the alumni associations in Chongqing and Kunming, and myself are completely consistent. Regardless of the present or the future, Peking University will not allow personnel from puppet schools and puppet organizations to set foot in it.</p>
<p>Minister Agrees</p>
<p>(4) Lu Peking University has agreed not to hire people from puppet schools and puppet organizations to teach. This point has been agreed by Minister Zhu. Our goal is to ensure the clean reputation of Peking University. It is reported that Yenching University has dismissed all professors of the school who participated in the puppet Peking University. I admire this very much.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Plans to Divide the City into Sixteen School Districts</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This City] The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the fact that the municipal administrative area has been divided into 33 districts by the municipal government, has divided the school districts based on the distance and population of each administrative district in preparation for the implementation of national education. It is reported that before the bureau divided the school districts, the National Education Office sent personnel to the household registration section of the police station to investigate the population and the number of school-age children in each district as the basis for the division of districts. Except for the former Public Concession and the French Concession and the Hongkou area, which are each divided into two districts, the rest are merged as appropriate. A total of sixteen school districts are divided for the area where national schools should be established in the city. The total number of municipal elementary schools in the city is currently 109. Before the war, there were more than 200 public schools. At present, the number of schools restored is only half of that before the war. It is also reported that in the new administrative districts to be taken over, more than ten schools such as Sanqiang, Qiangshu, Maqiao, Qipu, Xinxi, and Zhuanqiao are all public schools that have been operating for many years and are now within the scope of this city. It is reported that Director Gu of the Education Bureau is requesting the municipal government to approve the plan.</p>
<h3>National Business School Faculty and Students Oppose Merger; They Support President Zhang to Strive for It with the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] The National Business School has been established for eight years. Graduates from all sessions have served in public and private institutions with remarkable achievements. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education once planned to move the school to Shanghai in order to develop it. Recently, the school suddenly received a telegram from alumni in Chongqing that the Ministry of Education had a proposal to merge the school into a certain university. The faculty and students of the entire school were extremely dissatisfied upon hearing the news and initiated the organization of a school protection committee to continue to carry out school protection work and declared that no school is allowed to accept it, otherwise something unexpected will happen. The school, for the sake of proper caution, unanimously recommended President Zhang to travel to Chongqing immediately to insist on his position and strive for it with the ministry. It is now known that President Zhang has already traveled to Chongqing on a special trip. Relevant personnel of the school said: If a satisfactory result cannot be obtained, the faculty and students of the entire school will go to Chongqing on foot to petition. Before the decree has been issued, the faculty and students of the entire school are still doing their best to remain calm and continue to attend classes as usual.</p>
<h3>Daxia University on the Banks of the Chishui River</h3>
<p>- Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>When the first bullet of aggression exploded on the Huangpu River, Daxia University on Zhongshan Road in Fanhuangdu, together with Fudan University on Jiangwan Road in Zhabei, moved west to Lushan and organized a joint university, setting a precedent for domestic joint universities after the War of Resistance. Subsequently, there were Southwest Associated University, Northwest Associated University, and Christian Associated University. When the National Army withdrew westward from Wuhan, Daxia University continued to move to Guiyang, setting up its own branch and struggling under the heavy pressure of high prices. The lectures have never been interrupted in the past six years. Last winter, enemy cavalry ravaged Dushan and Duyun. Daxia University moved again to Chishui County, on the border of Guizhou and Sichuan. At that time, the situation was tense, and the northward move was rushed, but the order was in order. It is still praised by people from all parts of the Southwest. A spirit of teacher-student cooperation and mutual assistance in the same boat has been fully demonstrated in this battle.</p>
<p>Because Chishui is located in a remote area and the people's wisdom is blocked, even during the war, the news from the outside world is still extremely isolated. Therefore, the area uses radio to broadcast news every day and publishes a small newspaper - "Quick News" twice. The citizens are all vying to listen to the news. Originally, in addition to carrying out specialized research in academics, a university also has the mission of transforming and promoting society. Therefore, all teachers and students use their spare time from research to cooperate with the local authorities in various undertakings such as education and health. Therefore, the local gentry and citizens have expressed their greatest welcome to the migration of the university to the north. In addition to providing various conveniences, they have also assisted in solving the problem of school buildings and school equipment.</p>
<p>Daxia University currently has colleges of literature, science, law, and commerce. After the Ministry of Education had a proposal to abolish the separate establishment of normal colleges, the university still plans to restore and add the most historical and prestigious College of Education. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education has approved the university to move back to its original site in Fanhuangdu, Shanghai in May next year. Currently, all teachers, students, and alumni are preparing for the resumption of school with all their strength. Soon, a new scene will appear on the banks of the Liwa Liyi River in Fanhuangdu, which has been deserted for eight years. But on the banks of the Chishui River, lined with green willows, perhaps the air will feel silent.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Confiscated Goods to Be Sold at Discount Prices Soon; All Secret Reports Thoroughly Investigated</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has successively taken over more than 400 warehouses in the city. Of these, over 100 have been inventoried. Yesterday, the Review Committee processed the materials stored in 33 of these locations. A portion will be handed over to relevant authorities for use or sold through public bidding, while a significant amount will be directly supplied to the market at discount prices. Furthermore, the bureau has recently confiscated a substantial quantity of materials based on secret reports. These materials are stored in various warehouses. It was also decided yesterday that a portion of these will be sold at discount prices.</p>
<p>Significant Quantities of Daily Necessities</p>
<p>In addition, the finished products taken over from various factories by the Economic Special Commissioner's Office have been listed and submitted to the Review Committee for a decision on whether to distribute them to the market in batches at discount prices. It is reported that these materials are diverse and substantial in quantity, and it is predicted that they will be quite effective in stabilizing prices. Among the main daily necessities, it is learned that there are over 800,000 *jin* (approximately 400,000 kilograms) of oils such as rapeseed oil and soybean oil, 650,000 *jin* (approximately 325,000 kilograms) of beans such as soybeans and broad beans, over 6,500 boxes of various soaps, approximately 1,000 bags of sugar, over 10,000 *pi* of cloth, 23,000 dozen socks, 50,000 pounds of wool yarn, 40,000 porcelain basins, over 200 boxes of cigarettes, 15,000 *jin* (approximately 7,500 kilograms) of soy sauce, over 1,000 pounds of MSG, 1,500 cases of matches, 1,000 cases of glass panes, 1,300 rolls of newspaper, and 1,700 reams of foreign paper. The Management Bureau will decide on the method for distributing these materials to the market in batches in the near future. It is reported that the daily necessities decided to be sold at discount prices only account for a small portion of the materials received from various sources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the imminent arrival of large quantities of foreign goods, there is an urgent need for warehouses. Therefore, the Review Committee has decided to expedite the clearing of warehouses. All agencies allocated goods and purchasers of goods are required to remove them from the warehouses within one week without delay. Otherwise, alternative arrangements will be made so that a significant number of warehouses can be vacated.</p>
<p>Actively Handling Tip-Offs and Issuing Rewards</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has been receiving an increasing number of reports, which are individually investigated thoroughly, resulting in many breakthroughs. It is reported that rewards for tip-offs will be issued promptly, in the form of cash or valuables. Informants may submit written applications, which will be handled by the Management Bureau at its discretion. However, applicants for rewards in the form of physical goods are limited to the originally reported confiscated items. To ensure fairness and impartiality in the amount of rewards, the bureau's Valuation Committee will first assess the value of the properties recovered based on the tip-offs. Then the Accounting Advisory Committee will decide on the rewards. The lists of the Valuation Committee and the Accounting Advisory Committee are recorded below: (1) Valuation Committee: Chairman Zhao Zukang (Municipal Government), Members Wang Shiqi (Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), Zhang Dengyi (War Transport Bureau), Yu Bingjian (Municipal Telecommunications Bureau), Ling Xianyang, Chen Pengnian (Ministry of Finance), Gui Jihuan, Gao Boling (Ministry of Economic Affairs). (2) Accounting Advisory Committee: Chairman Pan Xulun, Advisors Xi Yushu, Xu Yongzuo, etc.</p>
<p>Sealed Radiators Not to Be Moved</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau stated that it has begun to handle the registration of requests from homeowners to recover radiators and heating equipment that were dismantled and removed without compensation by the enemy and puppets. No organization or group may arbitrarily move sealed radiators and other items. Furthermore, it is forbidden for shops and secondhand stalls to buy or sell radiators and other items of unknown origin. If discovered, severe punishment will be imposed. All owners may, within ten days, submit to the Management Bureau detailed reports including their name, nationality, address, location of the house, quantity, type, size, and other distinguishing marks of the removed radiators or heating pipes, along with all relevant supporting documents, for investigation and return as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Subcommittee to Study Solutions</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of remaining radiators and heating equipment whose property rights cannot be determined, the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee passed a resolution yesterday (6th) to form a subcommittee to study and handle the matter. The subcommittee will be chaired and convened by Deputy Mayor He Dekui, with Municipal Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Police Bureau Director Xuan Tiewu, Management Bureau Directors Zhao Chuanding and Chen Guqiu, and legal advisor Cai Rudong as members. In addition, the British and American consulates and the U.S. military headquarters will be invited to send representatives as advisors to ensure fair and reasonable handling. It is further learned that most of the radiator heating equipment has been moved away or destroyed by the enemy and puppets. The remaining quantity is limited. In addition, the transportation of coal is not yet smooth, and coal prices are high. Therefore, heating equipment may be prioritized for hospitals, wards, and Allied forces to adapt to the current environment.</p>
<h3>Robbery Cases to Be Tried Under Military Law</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Army Chief of Staff General He telegraphed yesterday, granting approval to the Songhu Garrison Command to try all robbery cases during martial law, regardless of whether the perpetrators are military personnel, in accordance with Article 9 of the Martial Law.

<h3>Mr. Liu Hongsheng Discusses the Distribution of Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>To date, a total of nine ships carrying relief supplies to China from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have arrived in Shanghai, transporting over 80,000 tons of relief goods. This reporter specially interviewed Mr. Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, yesterday. According to him, since the arrival of the first Liberty ship, the "Vida," on the 2nd of last month, carrying relief supplies to Shanghai, up to the ninth ship, the "Skinner," which arrived the day before yesterday, a total of 112,000 tons of flour, 310,000 tons of wheat, 3,100 boxes of dried beans, 650 trucks, 65,780 burlap sacks, and other miscellaneous goods, newspapers, galvanized iron sheets, water-resistant cement, road construction materials, medicines, old clothes, and canned fruit have been transported.

Finally, Mr. Liu stated that old clothes will soon be distributed to Hankou, Pingjin, and other regions, while Shanghai will distribute them to various charitable relief organizations today. Each person will be given one piece of clothing based on the number of people sheltered by each organization.</p>
<h3>He Dekui Not Concurrently Serving as Director of Finance Bureau</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that Deputy Mayor He Dekui of the Shanghai Municipal Government might concurrently serve as Director of the Finance Bureau. A spokesman for the Municipal Government stated that this was inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Hong Lanyou and Lu Jingshi Rescheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Wu Shaoshu Postponed Departure from Chongqing</h3>
<p>Member of the Central Committee and Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Hong Lanyou, was originally scheduled to leave Chongqing yesterday on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight to Shanghai, together with Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, and Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs.

<h3>Inland Waterway Routes of Steamers to Resume in Short Order</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] It has been over a month since the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took over the "China Inland Waterways Steamship Company." To understand the latest situation of the company's inland waterway transportation, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Inland Waterways Management Office yesterday. According to him, the vessels taken over include 53 small steamers and over 60 barges, but most of them are in poor condition. Currently, only over 10 small steamers and a portion of the barges can operate. The passenger routes that are operating are Shanghai to Pinghu, Suzhou to Jiaxing, and Suzhou to Huzhou, with one round trip each day. The fare is 800 yuan per person. Shanghai to Wuxi only provides freight service, with one round trip every two or three days. The freight rates are divided into four categories (A, B, C, D) based on the nature of the cargo, with charges exceeding 2,000 yuan per ton. The office is currently actively repairing the remaining damaged vessels to restore the original inland waterway routes in the short term to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>No Restrictions on Electricity Usage for Factories</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Fuel Committee will supply as much coal as possible to the Shanghai Power Company from the coal shipped to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao, Lianyungang, and other places. Therefore, there will be no restrictions on electricity usage for factories thereafter, which will accelerate the development of production. It is hoped that this will lead to a gradual decline in commodity prices in the city. However, electricity usage for residential households will still be slightly restricted, and neon lights, being non-essential, may have their electricity supply discontinued.</p>
<h3>Feng Youzhen and Luo Xuelian Appointed Representatives of the Central Propaganda Department in Shanghai; Responsible for News and Film Aspects Respectively</h3>
<p>To maintain close contact with Shanghai's cultural circles, the Central Propaganda Department has decided to appoint Feng Youzhen and Luo Xuelian as its representatives in Shanghai. Feng is responsible for the news and publishing fields, while Luo is responsible for the film and drama fields. They are also responsible for continuing to handle the enemy and puppet cultural affairs in the Shanghai area. It is reported that the unfinished matters of the former Central Propaganda Department Special Envoy's Office will also be transferred to Feng and Luo for handling.</p>
<h3>Settling the Blood Debts of the Eight Years; Deadline for Registering Enemy Crimes Extended; Over Three Thousand Four Hundred Cases Registered</h3>
<p>The Enemy Crimes Investigation Office of the Shanghai District Local Court Procuratorate, which is settling the blood debts of the Shanghai area with Japan, originally set yesterday as the deadline for registering enemy crimes. However, due to the overwhelming number of people going to register in recent days, reaching over a thousand people each day, with some even arriving at the door of the Procuratorate on Mahua Road as early as 3 a.m. to wait for the opening, most of them coming from the rural areas of Wusong, Pudong, and Yangshupu, having suffered from the oppression and destruction of life and property by the enemy for eight years, they flocked to the Procuratorate to report enemy crimes and demand compensation. The number of people handling this registration work at the Procuratorate was originally only three, then increased from five to nine, and now has reached fifteen, but from morning to night, they are still overwhelmed. Because the residents in the urban area who went to register are less than 5 percent, while 95 percent are rural residents from the suburbs, and over 90 percent of them are illiterate, the reported crimes must be written by the Procuratorate's reception staff, which takes a lot of time. As a result, the maximum number of cases that can be accepted for registration each day is only 500. As of yesterday morning, 3,483 enemy crimes had been registered, and over 1,000 cases had already been assigned registration numbers and are awaiting processing. Therefore, the Local Court Procuratorate decided yesterday to extend the deadline for registering crimes. Among all the registered crimes, deliberate destruction ranks first. As of yesterday afternoon, over 8,000 buildings had been registered as deliberately set on fire and destroyed by the enemy. Next is massacre, and the third is torture, rape, and other cases, which also number in the dozens.</p>
<h3>Measures for Bidding on Small Factories Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Review Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property has established three steps for bidding on 47 small factories, which will be publicly bid on in the coming days. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>Categorization</p>
<p>(1) Before the bidding, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will first categorize the nature of the factories, such as machinery, chemical industry, and textiles. Then, the Appraisal Committee of the Review Committee will evaluate the prices, and then the bidding will be advertised and publicly solicited.</p>
<p>Factory Inspection</p>
<p>(2) The bidder's bid letter must include the bidder's name and address and state the bid price in detail. After the Review Committee opens the bid letters, it will notify the bidders to inspect the factory they wish to bid on on a scheduled date. The factories will then be opened for another three days to facilitate bidder access.</p>
<p>Deposit Payment</p>
<p>After inspecting the factory, each bidder must pay a deposit of 1% of the bid amount to the Central Bank within three days. The Central Bank will issue a receipt, which can be exchanged for a letter of intent to purchase the factory. After filling it out and submitting it, the Enemy Property Review Committee, the Enemy Property Management Bureau, and the Economic Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will jointly dismantle the bid in accordance with the bidding rules.</p>
<p>Priority Purchase</p>
<p>It is also learned that the following two types of bidders have priority purchase rights: (1) Those who have made meritorious contributions to wartime production; (2) Those who have held positions in the factory and have achieved results. Only then are the general applicants considered. Currently, the Valuation Committee has begun to separately price the 47 factories. The first batch of factory lists should be announced this week.</p>
<p>Graduated Police Cadets Begin Service</p>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] To improve the level of the police and improve service efficiency, the Municipal Police Bureau has recruited a large number of police cadets and subjected them to rigorous academic training at the Police Training School. The first batch of over 500 people graduated a few days ago. Yesterday, they were assigned to various police stations to begin service, greatly increasing the strength to maintain public security in the city. It is reported that the bureau will soon recruit 100 old police officers and security corps police officers.</p>
<h3>Capital Registration for Various Industries; Filing Methods Decided; Procedural Aspects Given Flexible Handling</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified various industry associations yesterday that there are specific deadlines for member registration during the reorganization period and for industrial and commercial registration with the Bureau of Social Affairs. However, how to fill in the capital, the most important item on the registration form, is the prerequisite for this matter. Currently, in addition to the Industrial and Commercial Law Research Association and various industries and experts earnestly researching and submitting a request to the competent ministry for approval, there is deep concern that the matter will be delayed for a long time. Therefore, after consultation, a method has been agreed upon. All member registrations during the reorganization period of the association and the industrial and commercial registrations of the Bureau of Social Affairs will temporarily be filled in truthfully according to the amount of legal tender actually received in a certain year before the war and the amount of counterfeit currency actually received when capital was increased in a certain year after the war. In order to complete the registration procedures as soon as possible. However, if the capital is filled in according to the amount of counterfeit currency actually received, it will be converted into legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1, which will be very small. When the first category of profit-making enterprise income tax is levied next January, it is feared that it will not match the actual capital situation at that time, causing an excessive burden on industry and commerce. It is proposed to approve waiting for each industry and commerce to wait for the principle of converting capital back to legal tender to be approved by the competent authority and then levy the first category of profit-making enterprise income tax according to the revised capital amount, without calculating it according to the current temporary registration amount. This will ensure that the registration problem and the taxation problem can be resolved separately and fairly.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yichu Presides Over French News Agency</h3>
<p>Senator Zhang Yichu has been engaged in the news industry since childhood. As early as the Xuan统 years of the late Qing Dynasty, he followed the Premier in Singapore to advocate revolution. Later, he served as the Premier's aide and went to France. In the Xinhai year, he served as the representative of the Provisional President in France, writing articles for the Paris Morning Post to explain the theory of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), which aroused the sympathy of French people. It was not until 1931 that he left the political arena and was officially hired as the Director of the Chinese Department of the Far East Branch of the French Havas News Agency, making many contributions to the friendship between China and France. At the end of 1936, President Chiang flew back to the capital from Xi'an. Zhang was the first among foreign news agencies to report this major news to the world. Zhang served in the agency until early January 1941. He was forced to leave Shanghai due to the oppression of the enemy and puppets for supporting the leader and the National Government. He was then transferred to the agency's special correspondent in Chongqing. Later, because the Vietnamese government succumbed to Japan and became a Japanese puppet, he left the agency. When he was fighting in Shanghai, the rebel Ding Mocun mobilized all the bandits of the 76th Division, determined to kill him. Now, the World War has ended in victory for the United Nations, and the French Havas News Agency has been dissolved. A new French News Agency has been established, with its headquarters still establishing a Far East branch in China, and appointing Zhang as the editor-in-chief of the Chinese branch. Zhang has begun his service.</p>
<h3>CNAC Civil Aircraft to Land at Longhua</h3>
<p>According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) sources, the Jiangwan Airport in the city will be completely allocated for military use starting next week, and civilian aircraft will not be allowed to land. The company's aircraft will now land at the original Longhua Airport. Although the Longhua Airport was damaged by the enemy in the past and was unusable, it has now been completely repaired.</p>
<h3>Navy Announces Details of the Detention of the Minlian</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters stated that the Navy's Yong'an gunboat was ordered to guard the river surface near Zhenjiang due to rampant bandits, paying special attention at night. At 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, the Minsheng Company's Minlian ship and the Xuying and Minyu merchant ships arrived in Zhenjiang from upstream one after another. Instead of entering the port and mooring, they approached the north bank, creating a suspicious appearance. The Yong'an ship used international signal lights to inquire with the Minlian ship, but after 30 minutes, there was no response. A boat was then sent to inspect the ship. As the boat approached, it announced that it was a naval vessel, but the Minlian ship still ignored it and blindly opened fire, wounding Jin Yunkai, the executive officer of the Yong'an ship. He was sent to the Japanese Army Hospital that had been taken over. After examination by the doctor, it was found that a bullet had pierced his right abdomen, and five sections of his intestines were dissected. After suturing, he died on the 4th of this month due to excessive blood loss. It was found that the Yong'an ship had been ordered to guard the north bank of the Yangtze River and inspect suspicious ships. The Minlian ship and other ships were moored on the north bank, and the line of sight was unclear. After signaling to inquire and receiving no response, personnel were sent to inspect, which was their duty. Although they shouted, "It is a naval vessel, do not be afraid," the Minlian ship still ignored them and recklessly opened fire. The injured officer, Jin, refused to retaliate to avoid accidentally injuring innocent people and increasing misunderstandings. His handling was appropriate, and he has now died from his injuries. It is reported that the Naval Commander has submitted an official document to the Yangtze River Rehabilitation and Transportation Management Committee and the Minsheng Industrial Company, demanding a serious investigation to identify and severely punish the gunman, compensate for all losses, and provide preferential treatment to the victim's family to deter the unlawful and comfort the departed soul.</p>
<h3>Gold Bars! American Dollars! Girlfriend's Thieving Heart; Xue Guomei Detained for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhu Gengyong, also known as Lan Ying, the fourth concubine of warlord Zhang Zongchang, lives in a certain number of Zhongshi New Village on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai. She has a close friend named Xue Guomei, who is 37 years old, graceful and charming. She lives in Zhu's home and has become intimately acquainted with a certain military officer.</p>
<p>Frequent and Close Interaction</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhu never misses going out for outings and watching plays. One evening (the 3rd), the three of them went to the Grand Theater to watch a play. Before the end of the show, Xue made an excuse to go out. Who knew that she had sinister intentions, hired a car to rush back to Zhu's residence, and took the key to Zhu's secretly hidden bank safe deposit box and Zhu Yiyong's private seal. She did not return to the theater until about two hours later. At that time, Zhu did not suspect anything. But on the morning of the 5th, Zhu wanted to take some jewelry to the Four Banks Joint Savings Society on the lower floor of the International Hotel. When the safe deposit box was opened, it was discovered that the storage drawers inside contained</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Gold Bars</p>
<p>Several rings, gold brooches, gold necklaces, and hundreds of American dollars were missing. She immediately returned home and interrogated the male and female servants in the house, but could not find any clues. She suspected that Xue Guomei had stolen them, but there was no evidence. Xue also vehemently denied it. In the afternoon, Zhu and Guomei took a rickshaw to the bank again to investigate. When they reached Avenyue Road (now Yan'an East Road) on Datong Road, Xue was unwilling to go and jumped out of the car to escape. Zhu saw through her hidden intentions and called the police to detain Xue at the Xin Cheng Precinct Station for questioning. She finally confessed to the crime. Director He of the Precinct Station ordered officer Huang Yingjie and others to rush to a hotel on the north side of Jie Road and detain the military officer for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed Incident on Yulin Road; Drunken American Sailor Dies</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] At the home of Xu Alin, a local resident at No. 27 Pingliang Road, Hudong, at 3 a.m. yesterday, two American sailors who were excessively drunk suddenly came to knock on the door. His wife went downstairs and opened the door, and was grabbed and hugged by the two sailors. She was terrified and shouted for help. Alin heard the alarm and rushed out. Unexpectedly, he was punched and kicked by the two sailors, causing serious injuries and falling to the ground. The two sailors then fled. Xu chased after them, shouting loudly along the way. When they reached the intersection of Yulin Road and Dayingwan Road, where the 3rd Independent Battalion of the Military Police was stationed, a sentry at the gate, thinking that someone was violating curfew, fired his gun. In the darkness, fearing that thieves were robbing pedestrians, he fired three shots into the air, followed by one live round, which unfortunately hit one of the American sailors, killing him instantly. The other sailor fled without a trace at the time. After being reported, the American Military Police Department drove a hearse to take the body back. Around 8 a.m., the American military authorities sent two officers, a captain and a lieutenant, to the scene to investigate the details of the incident. They also photographed Xu Alin, the victim of the assault, for the record. The deceased was named Mahoruhl.</p>

<h3>Social Services - Exchanging Old Legal Tender for New Notes</h3>
<p>— Yong Yu</p>
<p>Recently in this city, it has often been heard that various businesses are refusing to accept slightly damaged legal tender and customs gold notes, causing obstacles to the circulation of legal tender for the people, hindering the unification of legal tender, which is truly unreasonable. I read in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your esteemed newspaper: "How to exchange damaged currency?" I am now writing what I know below to serve as a reference for those holding damaged banknotes. The Central Bank at 15 Bund, second floor, can exchange all damaged legal tender and customs gold notes for new notes. Not only does it exchange damaged banknotes from the Central Bank, but also damaged banknotes from other banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The exchange time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM (I heard that there is no exchange on Saturdays). I think that for the convenience of all sectors regarding the circulation of legal tender, the Central Bank should immediately send a letter to all banks and firms to accept all damaged legal tender. At the same time, the Financial Commissioner should announce to all industries that slightly damaged legal tender should be universally accepted and not be hindered. I would severely punish those who obstruct legal tender with the crime of obstructing legal tender. In this way, legal tender and customs gold notes can circulate without borders, which is truly beneficial to all sectors.</p>
<h3>Visiting the HMS Belfast: Remarkable Achievements in the Anglo-German Naval Battles</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 PM, over twenty Chinese reporters, led by a British Information Office representative, departed to visit the British Royal Navy flagship HMS "Belfast." The steamship traveled for about ten minutes to reach its destination. Admiral Servaes, Naval Commander, and Captain Dick were already waiting on deck. After shaking hands with each reporter, Captain Dick delivered a speech to welcome the reporters and expressed his gratitude for the welcome the ship had received from the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the visit, the twenty-plus people were divided into four teams, led by officers from the ship to visit various places. Our team was led by Captain Hilton. Sailors were busy painting in many places. The ship has four gun turrets, equipped with twelve six-inch cannons, eight four-inch dual-purpose guns, and anti-aircraft guns. Each gun turret has a special gun platform for control. The maximum long-range firing range can reach nine or ten miles, and the shells weigh sixty-five pounds.</p>
<p>Walking into a recreation room that can accommodate one hundred sailors, two young sailors were dancing the "Jitterbug." Movies can also be watched there. The navigation room and the command room are comprehensively equipped with various communication and signaling equipment to control the entire ship. In addition, there are position indicators and torpedo sights, which are equipped with great precision to manage all gun positions and torpedoes. Most of the machines are used in pairs to maintain balance. The ship has dedicated departments for everything related to naval warfare, including a chart room, a radio room, a weather room, and a water level measuring room. The middle of the ship has a flag deck and a signal room, with dozens of various signal flags in small wooden frames. In addition, there are eight small boats and three torpedoes. The relatively comfortable infirmary has twelve beds, and three military doctors are responsible for treatment. There is also a dedicated dental ward.</p>
<p>Arriving at the kitchen, the ship not only has several kitchens, but also a dedicated vegetable washing room. The cooks had just finished baking bread, which was extra-large. The cooks have already prepared the Christmas food. It is said that this cake can last for six months. The flagship's food not only supplies all the officers and soldiers on the ship, but also all the small boats in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Leaving the kitchen, it was exactly 4:00 PM, the ship was lowering the flag, and everyone stood at attention. Then we saw small teams of sailors on the deck being inspected for their uniforms and roll call by the captains. Soldiers go ashore twice a day, once at 1:00 PM and once at 4:00 PM, rotating shifts every day and must return to the ship before 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>The ship also has a special facility, which is the carpentry shop, a fairly large room where carpenters are busy making furniture. The equipment in the laundry room is particularly ingenious. Clothes are washed in a steam machine and placed in a rotating machine to dry. Ironing clothes is also done by machine, and a shirt can be ironed in two minutes.</p>
<p>At this point, the captains invited us in for refreshments. The furnishings in the officers' dining room were simple and comfortable. The people who came with us were very excited. Our team even forgot to visit the engine room. Although it was a bit dirty because of the oil, the equipment there was extremely sophisticated. The water filters and distillers were all in pairs, winding up and down, and we could hardly find our way out.</p>
<p>Although it was already 5:00 PM, we still didn't have time to visit all the equipment, but the sun had already set, and we had to say goodbye. Although we were all very grateful to the captains for their warm hospitality, we could only express our thanks in a few short words. Captain Dick also expressed his gratitude and, along with other officers, saw us off on deck, and the speedboat carried us back to the riverbank.</p>
<p>History of HMS "Belfast": HMS "Belfast" was built in Belfast, England, in 1939, at 11,000 tons. It was launched on September 3 of that year when Britain and Germany declared war, and served as a cruiser. In April, it unfortunately ran aground and was severely damaged. After repairs, it was relaunched in November 1942 and served as an escort in the North Sea, transporting supplies to the Soviet Union. In 1943, it sank the German cruiser "Scharnhorst". In 1944, it sank the German battleship "Tirpitz" in Aron Harbor. During the Normandy campaign, it worked for six weeks and made great contributions, and the damage it suffered was not great. Later, it visited Australia, Taiwan and other places. It arrived in Shanghai on September 19 this year. After the war ended, HMS "Belfast", although no longer participating in the war, still has important tasks. When will it return home? The captain said: "No one knows, maybe a few months, maybe a few days later." But they are all willing to spend more time in Shanghai, the largest city in the East.</p>

<h3>Music is a Source of Life</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>The love of music is human nature. This can be seen in infants still in swaddling clothes. When they are crying or making noise, they will stop immediately once their mothers hold them, pat them a few times, and sing a few songs. Sometimes they are even lulled to sleep. Older children often like to draw on their faces, hold knives or sticks, and perform dramas. Singing and acting are their only games and entertainment. Even the most foolish coolies or farmers know to sing or perform operas to seek spiritual pleasure when they feel bored while working. This shows that human interest in music is innate.</p>
<p>For this reason, music has the most universal relationship with the public and the most profound relationship with human life among all arts. Music possesses a special power, which is greater than anything else. It can directly touch emotions without relying on objective things, so its effects are significant. The relationship between music and life is as follows:</p>
<p>Expressing meaning and emotion through language is more free and direct than writing. However, when expressing, it is necessary to put thoughts into the form of language. In other words, reason is necessary and emotion alone cannot be used to express language. Music, however, can be expressed directly without restriction and can influence the emotions of the listeners. For example, Zhang Liang of the Han Dynasty was able to disperse eight thousand soldiers with the power of a flute. During the French Revolution in 1792, Lisla composed the passionate "Marseillaise", which inspired the morale of the volunteers, and the revolution succeeded. When we listen to the Russian "Song of the Volga Boatmen", we feel infinite sympathy for the laborers. This incomprehensible power is indeed very magical. It can move people's emotions and make them forget themselves, unconsciously merging with the emotions of the music. Therefore, expressing emotions through music is the most direct.</p>
<p>The progression of musical tones in music has a certain length. The repeated recurrence of this form creates a sense of strength and weakness, which is called rhythm. The reason why people feel pleasure or sorrow when listening to music is entirely based on the effect of rhythm. Our physiological phenomena, such as the beating of the pulse and the circulation of blood, are the same as the structure of music, with a certain regularity. For the sake of our physiological needs, whether the ears listen to sounds or the eyes see things, they must be rhythmic and regular to feel comfortable. This applies to daily necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and the various aspects of mental activity. If everything in life can develop a habit of rhythm, life will become richer and more fulfilling. The goal of the New Life Movement in advocating the disciplining of life is precisely this. The so-called disciplined life is a musical life. To have a disciplined life, we should have a considerable knowledge of music, contact music more, and be influenced by music more.</p>
<p>Food is material nutrition, and material nutrition is of course indispensable for life. However, the spirit also needs a kind of nutrition. What is this nutrient? It is music. Westerners believe that if one does not take in noble music, the spirit will lack nutrition, just as the body lacks nutrition if one does not eat every day. They regard music as spiritual food. Workers need labor songs to restore fatigue when they work, and soldiers need military songs to inspire the courage to kill enemies when they march. Lullabies are made for children to urge them to sleep. Even cafes and restaurants have music performances to entertain the spirit. We often see farmers singing mountain songs in the fields while cultivating, enjoying themselves. Laborers lifting heavy objects call out "Hang Yu Hang Yu", as if using this simple song to summon their strength to work, but do not feel tired. This is clearly the effect of music.</p>
<p>The relationship between music and life is so profound, and since human beings are inherently endowed with an interest and talent in music, we should use the power of music to give the public opportunities to appreciate music and form a musical life.</p>

<h3>The Victory of the Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhong Baoshi</p>
<p>××: When did you go to Shanghai? I didn't know until I read your letter, but it seemed like someone told me you left on the 27th. Mr. Gu Shusen came to see my art exhibition. I asked him, and he said he had sent you off.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for your concern for my art exhibition. Do you remember when Mr. Lao She and I were eating at the Tianjin Pavilion in Qixinggang, I said after drinking that the art exhibition had good prospects? Now, thanks to your blessing, the result this time is really satisfying. Since the victory, even for such a respected figure as Mr. Chen Shuren, the art exhibition here has been only so-so. I was lucky to create a record. It should be considered rare for someone who has always been accustomed to solitude. A total of 102 large-format paintings and 50 album leaves were exhibited. As a result, two-thirds of the large-format paintings and one-half of the album leaves were sold. The celebrations today are unimaginable! But it also exhausted me!</p>
<p>I am now living a malaria-like life again, going to Central University once every other week. I expect to be able to leave here during the summer vacation next year, but I often think that if I were alone, it seems that I should also leave the "fog". But I can't, and the "victory" has added to my burden even more than the "resistance war"! I will resign myself to fate and be a "Sichuanese" for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Mr. Lao She's letter arrived at the same time as yours. He doesn't know how my art exhibition turned out yet? The letter is full of words of consolation, which is very grateful. He invited me to Beibei for a tour. I also want to go, but I remember that one person has already left Beibei, so it seems difficult for me to say yes. I heard from friends that Shanghai "Zhengyan Bao", maybe "Ta Kung Pao", has a Chongqing dispatch reporting on my art exhibition. I don't know if it's praise or sarcasm. He said that my paintings were sold out at a high price of 200,000 each. I don't know if this is true? Please check it out. You asked me to write a short article. I'll give it to you when I have time, but I'm afraid it won't be suitable.</p>
<h3>Artists Arise!</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Our ethnic culture is constantly progressing, and art is really the pioneer of national culture. The art movement in the rear during the War of Resistance did not stop, but in the occupied areas, artists were unwilling to express much due to temporary suffocation. But now is the time, especially in Shanghai, the cradle of China's new art movement. We must not let it decline. For example, Mr. Liu Haisu, a pioneer in the art world, should come out to lead us. When Mr. Liu was young, he introduced the most advanced artistic trends and styles in the world to China, and later introduced our inherent national art to the international art world. He has made immortal contributions to the Chinese art movement. He is already fifty years old this year, and he could have rested, but for the sake of the art movement, we cannot let him rest. Similarly, all artists who have put down their pens should rise up!</p>
<p>Notes from the Brush</p>
<h3>Those Who Eat Meat</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>When a tiger eats a person, it wishes it could swallow them whole, skin and bones included. Although it feels triumphant, it is ultimately just a "dumb brute" among the "meat-eaters"!</p>
<p>Think about it! People are "terrified at the mention of tigers," and hunters are eager to try, "setting traps to wait for them, and using bows and arrows to shoot them." Today's people even have "Browning and Thomson" guns. Do you think these brutes have any chance of survival other than "hiding deep in the mountains"? Otherwise, besides "surrendering", they must also contribute some "tiger bone plaster"!</p>
<p>Mosquitoes and fleas are much smarter! Their method of "eating meat" is more "scientific". They know how to select the essence and refine it. They only suck a little "blood" from people. They are not as ferocious and terrifying as tigers. The flea, it will be silent, as agile as skilled doctors giving injections and performing surgery. And the mosquito! It is even smarter. When it sneaks up, it will even sing a soft "hypnotic song" like a "nursery rhyme" or "lullaby"!</p>
<p>When you are sucked a little blood by a flea or mosquito, if it is just a little redness and swelling, "a skin disease is not worth mentioning"; if it brings you a terrible infectious disease, when you fall ill, you still want to use your own hand to slap your own mouth, complaining about why it didn't pay attention to diet!</p>
<p>Do you believe it? The facts are all there. Tigers have long disappeared, except for the few in cages in the zoo, while mosquitoes and fleas are rampant everywhere.</p>
<h3>Firecrackers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Beihai</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, the municipal authorities issued a notice prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers, probably to "be careful of fire!" This made me think that in mid-August, when the citizens of Shanghai suddenly heard the news of Japan's surrender, they were all ecstatic. Although they were still under the pressure of enemy forces at the time, everyone's mind seemed to be eager to try, wishing they could immediately rise up, cheer and celebrate, to express their joy. In particular, everyone felt that they should have a large number of firecrackers in their hands, and set them off together to shake the whole city, which would be the most enjoyable thing.</p>
<p>It was not until the first few senior military and political officials arrived in Shanghai that the citizens had the opportunity to set off firecrackers to express a warm welcome.</p>
<p>However, as central officials came to Shanghai one after another, the firecrackers did not make a sound. I don't know why they lowered their heads.</p>
<p>In the short few dozen days, seeing the ups and downs of firecrackers, I couldn't help but feel emotional. So I drew a picture of firecrackers. Not only is the brushwork simple and ancient, but also the colors are bright and colorful. I felt very proud of myself. Then I copied the firecracker poem by the Qing Dynasty poet Jiang Xinyu on it:</p>
<p>The power of the cannon depends on gold and stone, but it is a pity that it is physically weak. A wisp of lightning triggers it, and spring snow flies in ten thousand layers. The body is broken due to the crazy medicine, and the heart is long with the opportunity for disaster. I don't know who is covering their ears, and still laughs at the thief who steals the bell.</p>
<h3>Shui Long Yin [a type of Ci poetry]</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Due to the changes of the times, the commonly used words are also different. However, the old poems and lyrics are still the same. I once talked with several friends about trying to embed new words into the old lyrics to see what it would be like. This was still many years ago. At that time, it happened that a friend of mine and my student got married. My friend was a drawing teacher, and my student was the daughter of a poetry expert. Of course, she was also a master of poetry. In theory, it was a "perfect match" and a match made in heaven. However, because they were a widow and widower getting married, the local "gentry" "mutually criticized". I insisted on filling in a "vulgar song" to congratulate them. Their auspicious day was chosen in the summer, and that summer was particularly cool, which was especially gratifying. My lyrics have been destroyed by the war, but this song can still be recited today. Writing it down in silence is also a memorial.</p>
<p>Is life just for life? Do not heed idle words and gossips. Vulgar people's views, what is right and wrong, accustomed to wrong is right. The tradition of thousands of years, the concept that has been acquired is difficult to abandon at once. But we act with a clear conscience, what I think is right, I will do. It is good that the heavens have given beauty, how exceptionally cool is this summer? The heat has been hidden, and there is much convenience. Poets are elegant. A sweet honeymoon, enjoying the lakes and mountains, painting, love, poetry, and thoughts. What is it like for the immortals? Like them, they are a couple of immortals.</p>

<h3>Bulk Sales by Merchant Guilds, Gold Market Still Lacking Momentum, Public Bonds Stand Out, Commodities Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw intense competition between bulls and bears. The initial price was flat, followed by weakness. Banks and securities firms absorbed a lot of gold, but merchant guilds sold off actual gold in bulk. There was no special news to stimulate the market. On the contrary, there were rumors that favored short positions. Major players were also discouraged and lacked the power to act. The market weakened further in the afternoon. The price fell with the US dollar, retreating to over 67,000. As a result, the closing price fell by 27,000 compared to the previous day. Decorated gold was priced at 75,000 per tael. Sycee silver remained at 650. Silver dollars also stood at 450. The unofficial interest rate was still above 1.3 at the beginning, but eventually weakened, generally between 0.1 and 0.12.</p>
<p>The US dollar also rose and fell with the gold market. Initially, it hovered around 1170 yuan, showing stability. But it finally gave way at noon. In the afternoon, currency exchange companies supplied a steady stream of actual dollars, continuing to plummet below 1130 yuan. The old Hong Kong dollar was slightly firm, while the new Hong Kong dollar continued to decline. As a result, the old Hong Kong dollar rebounded by 10 yuan, while the new Hong Kong dollar fell by 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The public bond market did not show any special features at the start. The lowest price was half a percent to one percent lower than the closing price of the previous day. After hovering for a long time, major players sold gold and bought bonds, causing a surge. Subsequently, major players in the stock market saw the opportunity and came in. Retail investors also followed the trend and competed to buy. The market closed at the highest price at noon. Miscellaneous bonds failed to catch up as much due to time constraints. As a result, the closing price rose by 20 yuan to 65 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The stock market was slightly slack. With no prospect of resumption, many people switched to buying public bonds, resulting in a decline. There was a slight rebound at noon due to short covering. As a result, all stocks fell slightly, except for Xinguang, which remained flat. The trend is still uncertain. Foreign stocks were initially flat, followed by weakness. A lot of capital flowed into Chinese stocks, engaging in the purchase of small stocks, but the result was a decline of half a percent. Trading was mostly in Yisha, Yipijiu, and paper stocks, with the rest being sparse. Therefore, unpopular stocks were oversupplied.</p>
<p>Rice and grain: After a continuous decline, the rice market yesterday saw a slight stabilization. Medium-grade white japonica rice and indica rice showed a slight firmness. Baiyuan also tended to be firm. The Ningbo and Fujian merchant guilds were active but not prosperous in the flour market. The oil market also recovered due to active retail sales, rising by 2,000 yuan. Yellow beans were weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. Corn was slightly over 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts remained unchanged. The liquor market turned firm.</p>
<p>Yarn and thread: The decline has stopped, but the sentiment is still soft. The market opened in the morning with scattered buyers, raising prices by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. But in a short time, sellers supplied very actively, and prices fell back to the closing price of yesterday. In the spot market, all factories are willing to sell, especially the 20-count Caihua Shuangxi and 16-count Guangming Tiannv brands produced by Shenxin Yarn Factory, which flooded the market, making it even more difficult for prices to turn around.</p>
<p>Dyes: Recently, the Sichuan and Yangtze merchant guilds have had some appetite, which could have stabilized the market. However, the holders of goods, seeing that all commodity prices were falling, did not dare to be reserved and started to sell off, so the market price became very weak.</p>
<p>Silk: The raw silk market was sluggish, with only a dozen or so bales opening. High-grade factory silk retreated to within 1 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. The ordinary five-dan stalls were inactive. Retail and dried silk also fell by about 30,000 yuan.</p>
