<p>〔中央社南京二十三日電〕蔣主席偕夫人二十三日上午九時半，專機離京飛渝，商參軍長，俞局長，暨鄉間秘書長等隨往。事前　主席曾傳諭勿令外間得知，免萬千市民，殷勞相送，兼以節省其光險。此間黨政軍各界首長，仰體主席之至意，僅由馬市長一人，前赴機塲，代表忝送。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二十三日電〕蔣主席偕夫人，暨商參軍長震，王外長世杰，兪局長濟時等一行，今上午十時三十五分，分乘飛機二架，由京返渝，主席所乘飛機，經武漢時曾盤旋上空，巡視一週，於下午二時四十分安抵九龍坡機塲。主席與夫人即乘軍至官邸休息。按自抗戰獲勝以後，主席係首次巡行故都與首都，計自十一日由渝飛平，駐留八日，十八日抵京駐留六日，主席所至各地，曾受民衆熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十三日電〕馬歇爾特使昨日飛抵重慶後，即由行政院長宋子文陪往嘉陵村駐節，旋與美代辦勞勃生及其他數人進餐。馬氏昨夜以旅途勞頓，進餐餐後即就寢，往訪者除一部份外國記者外，並無其他賓客，馬氏隨員薛普萊談稱：前美國第三軍司令巴登中將在歐逝世噩耗，馬氏尙未知悉。馬氏寓某國家銀行住宅，其中設備完美，有比汀及冷熱水、鋼窗及　花地板，在重慶已屬不可多得。前美國代表威爾基及前美國副總統華萊士，及其他美國名人訪渝，</p>
<p>〔又電〕美國特使馬歇爾在兪之起居住尙未排定，僅悉將於聖誕夕被邀出席蔣主席夫婦之聖誕夜餐。據薛普萊稱：特使擬於可能範圍內，謝絕一切應酬，專心致力於其重大任務。隨馬氏同來者，除薛普萊外，尙有軍事參贊只爾樂上校，及侍從希克，索爾及軍恩三人。馬氏駐華久暫，現尙無從預測，或將視中國政治及軍事情形發展而定。中國如能早日獲得和平統一，則馬氏留華期間或可縮短。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京二十三日電〕蔣主席偕夫人，今晨已雕此返渝。主席此次蒞京，雖使小駐五日，然其予自都及東南各地同胞精神上之溫暖，則一如巡視北平之結果，非數字上可估計。此可於日來京中人士之街談巷議，及滬上各報歡欣鼓舞言論見之。主席蒞京五日，晋謁總理陵寢，接見馬歇爾特使，及指示來京晋謁之各地軍政長官外，並曾數度抽暇巡視市區。二十日曾輕車簡從，至陵園各地視察。二十一日往五台山參觀日軍所建之（神社），並在該處召見馬市長超俊，指示市政建設。二十二日再度遊覽靈谷寺，並曾對寺僧埀　。旋赴光華門外，於巡視飛機塲之外，似曾憑弔當年南京守城戰之戰蹟。當晚爲離京前夕，召集首都黨政軍負責人員，共進晚餐，席間諄諄訓示，南京爲舉世觀瞻所警之我國目都，對於全市市容之整肅，及新生朝氣之培植，實爲復興工作中之要圖，旋列舉各點，指示周詳。聞對市政興革，並曾數次手令馬市長指明，（一）中山路須予全部葺修，（二）中山門及挹江門城樓，須重加改建，（三）自來水及下水道，尙須改進，（三）市區標語，應予改良。市政當局奉令後，刻正籌劃實施中。此外，主席行轅在京所設之五處陳訴箱，三日來民衆投函，頗見踴躍，其間動人故事之多，亦不下於北平。主席啓節前，並派鄭副秘書長彥棻留京，處理結束事宣。其勤求民隱之殷切，京中父老，莫不感奮。又主席夫人蒞京五日，其靄然可親之態度，已留下最深刻印象於京中萬千男女老幼間，二十日夫人曾俏然微行，小餐於夫子廟大華春餐館，不數分鐘，門外羣衆　集，水洩不通，爭欲一睹夫人。餐畢出門，慰問老幼，頻頻問好，歷時十餘分鐘，方於歡呼聲中揮巾登車而去。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿二日專電〕在一片接收東北　中，拋灑在東北與華華內政與外交的夾縫中，好像被人遺忘了。兩月前，原想從東春去接收的劉多荃將軍，早已飛回北平過冬。熱河省政府應長委員們，也都在這裏遊山玩景，但是他們都希望東北問題開展后，能夠早點進入承德。劉主席并且打算下月中旬到承德，部署一切。熱河原屬十二戰區，目前限于事實，原來準備進入熱河的十二戰區先遺軍司令孫蘭峯，已經飛回歸綏了，今後軍事由北平行營與東北行營分擔，但是金融交通行政方面，都要與東北各省一律。對於熱河軍事負着實際責任的杜聿明將軍，最近吿訴記者，在東北接收後，我們對熱河有辦法。熱河境內的蘇蒙軍，上月已經撤退，目前駐軍，多數是土八路，熱河的接收，現在已經不是外交間題了</p>

<h3 id="c9">皚皚長春兩成盛事　正式收市政與中行開幕 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿二日電〕本日此間兩大盛事，其一爲中行開幕，另一爲接收市政。此兩大歷史性感　已使積雪皚皚之長春，頓萌濃重之春意。若干市民雖未預知一夜長春遽劃時代，然大廣同塲，兩大巨型建築物前之車馬，及交又之黨國旗，則予彼等以鮮明之啓示。中行開幕於上午九時，三小時後新市長到任，摩肩接踵之賀客，包括東北行營軍事代表團，外交特派員公署，空軍司令部，軍政人員，長鐵理監事，地方士紳，及蘇聯商業司長，蘇遠東銀行經理，及馬元帥之經濟顧問，城防副司令等，均於中行進茶點後，陸續踏雪至市府。中行聞幕及接收市政，均未舉行儀式，賓主相見，笑語風生，浮現衷心愉快。街頭市民交談，皆以我們的政府，我們的銀行為言。彼等十四年來之積鬱，現正迅速消滅，代之者爲無限溫暖之憧憬，歷史上之「長春」，今已開始其無上眞義。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春二十二日電〕中央銀行分行，今日上午九時正式開業，由經濟委員會張主委，出特派員鍾，在行茶點熱量待賓客。張氏并對新聞界發表談話，說明中行使命，及發行九省流通券之意義。此項鈔券，現已聞始流通，本日所見者爲五十元券，其他四種俟運到後，亦即問世。五十元券爲紫色花紋，正面有海關照像，賀客爭相換取，紛請張主委及中行人員簽字留念。該行開幕後數分鐘，即有大批存款通進，其第一戶為中國銀行之一百萬元。中行經理由韋錫九氏暫代，副理為王宇經，胡兆英，亦係暫代性質，每日營業時間，暫定九至十午二時。</p>
<p>〔又電〕趙市長到任後，標揭三項基本施政方針，此三項方針，皆爲蔣主席所昭示者；（一）樹立良好的政治基礎。（二）加強經濟建設。（三）提高人民文化水準。趙氏並强調中蘇友好關係謂：今後次力求敦睦兩國邦交云。趙氏先後留學日美達十一年之久，歸國後，在軍政兩界服務歷十七年，曾任第二屆國民參政員，衡陽市長，兼警備司令等職。一二八時，氏任稅　團長，曾率所部，在淞滬一帶英勇抗戰，屢建勛功。</p>
<h3 id="c10">國軍收復東北　分四路推進　空運規模極龐大 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕國軍空運東北，週內即可開始。第五師長李則芬，今日已自長春返平，準備談師空運長春事宜。據悉：此次國軍空運東北，規模將異常龐大，而完成時間，將甚迅速，故其準備期間亦較長，致令人有不耐之感。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山電台二十三日廣播稱：昨在葫蘆息登陸之社聿明部隊，係由美第七艦隊運輸艦自海防直接運送者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿三日電〕國軍收復東九省，益見明朋化，聯絡組正向四個目標推進中，其他部隊本週空運長春，部署亦已完畢。據錦州消息：溝帮子至新民間一段鐵路，曾被共軍炸毀，刻已修復。國軍沿綫推進，已抵靑堆子，等候會晤蘇軍聯絡官，雙方將在新民開會，討論接收東北詳細辦法。第二聯絡組在北方向埠新推進，第三聯絡組向熱河省中部推進，其最終目的爲該省北部之赤峯；第四組自西南方推進，將在盤山與蘇軍聯絡。蘇絡組之移動，蹬明中蘇代表在長春已獲決定性之進步。其他如總司令部軍隊之在葫蘆島登陸，携有卡車及汽車四百六十五輛，增强實力，亦爲鼓勵之一因。國軍自葫蘆島推進九十里，俾在錦州司令部與杜聿明將軍接觸，九十四軍空運長春，本星期可開始，短期內可以完成。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶廿三日電〕全國英區今後仍舊將以推廣鄕村郵箱，充實郵政網，加强各類信件傳遞爲中心工作。電政方面，已決定不按政治區域，分爲九個電政區，每區設一管理局，擬以蘇浙皖三省爲第一區，區管局設南京。湘鄂贛爲第二區，區管局設漢口。閩粵桂爲第三區，區管局設廣州。黔滇兩省爲四區，區管局設昆明。川康藏爲五區，區管局設重慶。豫陝爲六區，區管局設西安。甘寗靑新爲七區，區管同設蘭州。冀魯晋爲八區，區管局設北平。東北九省爲九區，區管局設畏春。熱察綏三省，視將來業務情形，可能成一區，目前暫由北平兼轉。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京廿三日電〕美第七艦隊水陸部隊司令巴貝中將，來京勾留一日，曾兩次晋謁蔣主席商談要公，今晨離京赴滬，氏臨待體育中心笑語人，予曾在行政院長宋子文私邸酣睡一宵，床舖之舒適，使予戀戀不捨。馬歇爾特使，昨亦下榻此間，則予宿此有何不可。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕（遲到）巴貝海軍中將今日透露：渠與蔣委員長在此間會商時，已同意將自由輪六艘與數目未予宜布之坦克登陸船若干艘移交中國政府，嗣後將由中國船員駕駛，主要用於遣送日本軍民返國。此項船隻，目下正將其最後一次運赴華北與東北之軍隊卸下，一俟工作完畢，該項自由輪即將駛返上海移交中國船員。駕駛坦克登陸船之中國船員，刻在靑島訓練中，該處有美國水手六十人，方在敎導中國船員六百名。將來計劃訓練中國船員駕駛各型水陸兩用船隻，因該項船隻在美國爲過剩，且適宜在中國沿海與內河使用。自由輪屬于商船類，故其移交與中國，不必獲得國會之核准，自由輪與坦克登陸船上之砲位與其他戰時配備，均將予以拆卸。貝氏稱：今日下午與孫委員長會商時，曾討論中國船運工作之一般問題，但謂渠不能討論自由輪與坦克登陸船以外之其他援助運　輸要求，訓練船員計劃，係由蔣委員長提出。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京二十一日專電〕據權威方面對中央社記者透露：除非獲得新的確據，證明日皇有罪，或麥帥接獲以盟方民意爲歸之最高當局指令，則麥帥不擬以戰犯之名，加諸日皇裕仁，或迫其遜位。此間謠諑紛紜，以爲日皇即將列爲戰犯並有若干難加證實之報導，認爲日皇遜位，所以避免皇族制度蒙戰罪之汚，前宮內大臣松本康昌，渠現居日皇顧問之一，數日前與宮內大臣石渡莊太郎會晤後，對中央社記者稱：渠未悉麥帥總部與日本宮內方面，曾對戰罪及遜位事，作何討論。且麥帥對於日皇裕仁及日皇制度，未嘗有任何意見。日皇御弟高松宮親王，日昨亦有類似之表示。一般認爲日皇一旦遜位，商松出任攝政，最屬可能，因目下優見宮親王病肺，且因優見宮於中日戰爭發生後，曾與日軍閥有所往來，並與裕仁意見相左。據悉：日皇皇州歷史性之晉見麥帥時，曾吿以日皇政權刻無法實施，當時並要求予以一九四一年代表日本人民民意之個人特權。據悉：日皇當時曾對麥帥表示，處於軍閥支持之下，除專從發動戰爭外，實無他途可循。此項秘密會談，一般認爲滿意。於麥帥加諸日政府之各項指令中，消彌日皇及其臣民間之隔閡者，即使其不至仍爲多年來之政府傀儡。目下軍閥之政權，及其他權利，均被消滅，跪計多端之近衛文麿業已自殺身亡，而木戶幸一亦身入囹圄，裕仁自可執行其日皇之權柄。麥帥最近廢止政府有關之神道敎之訓令，亦可闡作使日皇不致又神道之故而受阻撓，并可致力於爲人正道。麥帥總部高級官員暗示：設或日皇能獨具慧眼，設法解決米荒及失業問題，並遵循麥帥所施諸日本之民主體制，使日人獲得合理完善之政府，則日皇及其制度可得保持永久。同時並警吿設或日皇於此危機四伏之際，仍執迷不悟，不能執行其皇上政權，則勢將發生革命，迫其退位，而日皇制度亦將以此根除矣。日皇決於旬日起，接見日本記者，此乃日皇欲洞察民情之發端。十數年來，由於軍閥及陰謀家有計劃之行動，使其不獲與人民謀面，隔閡遂生，然而內閣荏弱無能，議會參差異趨，日皇對其臣民，亦難有裨益。會信目下如能規定舉凡資格欠合，難加同意之政客，不得參預未來總選，則可補救目下情勢於萬一，惟新閣之籌組亦爲目前一大問題。最近此間盛傳日本宮內方面業已準備要求麥帥核准日皇之遜位，而麥帥固盼繼續佔領日本，恪遵乞降條款，並付諸實施，日皇本人盼將遜位一事，取決於日本人民。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日專電〕日本小型報紙民報，論及日皇接見日記者一事稱；究極言之，日皇賜見，並非眞正之會晤。在此民主世紀中，如日皇與人民之接觸，乃係適宜之舉，則何以人民不能與日皇作眞正之會晤。</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者　梁風</p>
<p>粵交通密邇，勢如唇齒，無論交通經濟僑務等問題，都有互惠相助的必要。粵省府羅主席車英將軍，爲使促進中英邦交及港粵關係，和觀摩香港英當局復興港九之道，俾以惜助他山；同時更以香港自淪陷後，不少未及逃出之僑胞，於敵人鐵蹄壓迫之下，艱苦奮鬥，孤貞自守，更爲羅主席所關懷，所以在十二月十日那火的上午六時半，羅主席便偕同省府委員黃文山，蕭次我暨隨員十餘人，一行由大沙頭乘廣九鐵路快車赴港，作非官式的拜訪香港當局，和慰問港九僑胞。</p>
<p>羅主席是一位允文允武，威名彪炳的百戰將軍，他首次帶領遠征軍出國，立功異械，這一切豐功偉績，是僑胞們早已無限尊崇的，何况在抗戰勝利之後，他們能够公開在那裹歡迎我們國家的長官，正如看到久違的家長一樣，怎不使他們感到光榮歡快而興奮呢？</p>
<p>僑胞獻花</p>
<p>車是下午三時到達。港督夏懿海軍少將，英陸軍司令菲士廷少將，還有我方的歡迎人物：國民黨駐港澳總支部主任委員陳素，中宣部代表吳厚恭，外交部兩廣外交特派員代表鍾瑜南，靑年團港九分團代表王毅夫暨靑年團男女團員，財政部閩粵區特派員鍾鍔，和僑領董仲偉，郭贊，以及各社團代表等有千多人，早已站在月台掬笑相迎。羅主席等下車後，與港督，菲士廷少將，和各代表都一一握手，互道寒暄。港督和菲士廷少將臉上都掛着一副笑容，表現非常愉快，却不像一般英國軍人那麼拘謹。</p>
<p>羅主席檢閱英皇家儀仗隊後，和港督同往檢閱旁主候迎的靑年團員，和接受港九僑胞獻花。這班靑年體魄强健。精神充沛，羅主席頻頻點首，似乎深深的在嘉許這班建立未來新中國的主人。</p>
<p>時間已不早了，羅主席偕港督等同乘着特備的汽艇渡海。六時，港督特設鷄尾酒食接風，羅主席當晚就由港督招待，下榻港督府。</p>
<p>盛會空前</p>
<p>主席便離開了督轅，偕隨員到國民黨駐港澳總支部，靑年團港九支團視察，並訪華商總會。接着往軍事代表團會晤莫興碩，潘華國，周雁賓三將軍，和三將軍一起往東蓬覺苑參觀香港佛教聯合主辦的義學，羅主席對那班天眞活潑的小學生，殷股垂問撫慰，備致愛護之情，使這班小朋友們感動得幾乎掉下淚來。</p>
<p>九時，港九各界假娛樂戲院舉行了一個盛大的歡迎會，參加的達千餘人，這眞是香港開埠一百年來空前未有的盛會，情緒異常熱烈緊張，充分表露僑胞們愛戴羅主席的熟情。羅主席那天全副武裝，胸前動章輝炫。眉宇軒昂，英風颯颯；當他於樂聲悠揚中步入會塲的時候，僑胞們得瞻　采，無不欣喜若狂。主席陳素致開會詞與商會主席董仲偉致歡迎詞過後，便是羅主席訓話，全塲空氣更呈肅穆緊張，羅主席首向僑胞們宣慰一番，隨後勉以「合作團結，使廣東更繁榮，建立三民主義的新中國，三民主義的新廣東……」，羅主席這一番諄諄訓示，給予僑胞們無限的溫暖與慰藉。</p>
<p>參觀英艦</p>
<p>散會後，羅主席應英海軍當局的邀請，參觀他們海軍巡洋艦「伯慕他」號，航空母艦「維尼琴斯」號及潛水艦「塔西敦」號。羅主席在遠征緬甸時的動績，原來是薄海同欽的了，所以艦上英海軍官兵得此機會看到這位中國精明能幹的將軍，大家都感到非常興奮，無不引爲榮幸。而他們的股勤招待與隆重歡迎，實亦使羅主席深深的　謝吧！　中午，羅主席應菲士廷少將　請，在英陸軍司令官邸午餐。</p>
<p>三時，羅主席又赴客籍僑胞組織的崇正總會的歡迎會，該會呈獻了一面繡着「黨國千城」字樣的錦族，接着又出席潮州商會的歡迎會。</p>
<p>在夜幕剛垂華燈初上的時候，羅主席又到建國酒家去參加港九各界的歡宴大會，這一個盛會，可算是羅主席這次訪問香港行程中最可紀錄的一頁，也可說是這一行程的節奏到了最高潮，僑胞們當羅主席作爲神聖一樣看待，又當他如家長一樣的親切尊崇，彷彿羅主席帶來了他們的春天似的，每個僑胞臉上都孕滿了得意笑容的。酒過三巡，僑領董仲偉致詞，他對羅主席備極讚譽，他說：「羅主席見文見武，智勇兼全，在緬甸之役屢立奇勳，威名彪炳，道次來主粵政，以治軍良法以治民，以作戰奇謀而理政，雖軍民之政各有不同，而其可以爲政之道則一；昔歐陽文忠公云，出將入相，勤勞王家，夷險一節，而措國家於磐石之安者，羅主席實足當之無愧……」</p>
<p>關懷僑務</p>
<p>着羅主席在雷動掌聲中，起立致親摯的訓話，他除了再三道謝僑胞們深厚的隆情之外，還闡明他對廣東的施政方針，他說：「發展僑務，充實華僑力量，使華僑成爲吾人建設的生力軍，實爲建設三民主義新廣東的施政五大綱領之一」。還說：「香港是發展南洋商業的總站，香港華僑向南洋方面作商業伸展，當然不是侵略，而僅係自然發展，因爲南洋華僑，是我們的兄弟……海外華僑以和平方式，憑自然的發展，奠定偉大的經濟基礎，對於祖國，貢獻至大……關於保陣人民事業。不特粵省施政方針有如此之決定，蔣主席對經濟政策已宣示，鼓勵人民經營，發展民生經濟，實行藏富於民，在發展商業中，僑胞實佔優勝地位，特別是港九同胞，粵省府秉承中樞政策，對工商事業，除公營外概予人民自由經營之便利，同時決予以保障，希望港九僑領，爲民衆國家之福利而作各種工商業之發展，配合國家之政策，努力於富强國家的工作。」隨後羅主席又介紹黃文山，蕭次尹兩委員與各僑領認識，因爲黃委員是打算在港稍作勾留，以便聽取各僑領對文化敎育事業的意見。而蕭委員留港的任務，是調查交通與糧食等問題。最後羅主席餌衆舉盃遙祝蔣委員長健康，這盛會便在愉快歡治空氣中結束。當羅主席在建國酒家門前登車的時候，羣衆早已圍觀如堵，他們都難得機會一瞻羅主席丰采的啊</p>
<p>香港話別</p>
<p>這位粵省行政的最高長官，以公務繁重，當然不能再躭擱，十二日的早晨，羅主席便和港九的十萬僑胞道別了！尖沙咀車站同前天一樣堆得人山人海，港督夏　偕同各長官也到站觀送，夏督還決定本月十七日偕港政府高級長官赴粵報聘。九時十分，火車無情地嗚嗚的呌起來，羅主席等一行祗好和歡送的人員一一握別，僑領們和一班靑年團的男女團員，更不盡依依之情，彷彿羅主席帶去了他們的心一樣；火車慢慢的離開月臺了，但看見他們却還站在那裏發呆。</p>
<p>雖然是這麼兩天短短的時間，但使我們深深的感到，在勝利以後，我們國際地位顯然已提高，盟國對我們國家，已是另外一種看法了。同時兩天來僑胞們的熱烈情緒，他們對祖國的長管是那樣尊崇，而更足表現他們期望祖國建國成功的心情，是何等的股切，羅主席說得好，他說：「過去兩天內，中英爾團人士融洽的空氣，足以預兆雙方合作前途的燦爛，同時，在僑胞親愛的氛圍裘，亦可預卜中國前途的偉大光　明。」這兩句話正好作本文的結尾。（三四·十二·于廣州）</p>
<p>蔣主席在北平留影　上圖：主席偕洛基將軍遊覽西山　下圖：主席夫婦招待北平耆紳</p>
<p>粵省政府主席於本月十日訪問香港，對今後中英合作及港僑事業之發展，有重大的貢獻。羅主席於訪問港督時，曾偕同前往參觀英航空母艦維尼琴斯號，（Venegenes）以資觀摩。</p>

<p>錢聲玎璫　如雷灌耳</p>
<p>沒有疑問，這免的確是個好地方。</p>
<p>上海還是東西會合，高談關論，錢聲玎璫，猶如雷鳴的大都市。外表變異很少。你還看得見顯然成一對照的本地房舍與摩登的高樓大廈。街上處處都是人。交通猶如洶洶湧湧無頭無尾的潮流。有聽天由命的徒步渚，橫衝直撞的自由車，魚貫而行的人力車，與疾馳飛騁的三輪車，那是一種不可思議而有驚人效率的人力車與三輪車合成的交通工具。</p>
<p>潛在形勢　在變動中</p>
<p>在內容方面，上海却完全不同了。目前，最緊要的遭在形勢，是一般事物差不多都處於變動中。最主要的變動，是市政府的產生。外圍大　，已經沒有操縱其權威。原來，英國式的工部局已經看不見了。市長是沉着的圓臉兒的錢大鈞，追隨　委員長的歷史很悠久。你還看得見影鬚叢生的紅頭阿三指揮交通，不過他們就要撤換了。美國的憲乒與海軍憲兵，所在都是，不過他們祗集中在有美國人居住或遊玩的所在。</p>
<p>非華爾街　無大貿易</p>
<p>上海依然是中國最大最繫華的都市。但它已孤立了很多年。上海狂妄的交易，都是區區小商品—好比紐的的零售商，沒有批發商製造商那樣的發狂。</p>
<p>「老上海」向你哭訴：與從前繁華的日子，比較起來，現在是何等的悽慘！但是美國軍人，在太平洋方面這一個豐成華麗的城市裏，却是個「優哉遊哉」的所在。</p>
<p>美國海軍，在這裏約有七千人，陸軍約有六千人。空軍人物，來去無定，不能作正確統計。飯館酒排間內，有啤酒。蘇格蘭酒。伏得加。（俄國酒）牛排。糕餅。其精美的中國食品。吃慣只有營養價値而無味道的軍糧之后　嘗嘗這些東西，的確是頂括括。</p>
<p>酒排生涯　日盛一日</p>
<p>酒排間與夜總會，一天興盛一天了。有一家叫做「原子咖啡室」。另一家叫做「吉普夜總會」，此外，還有一家，快要開幕了。有一家叫做伊文泰夜總曾，堪稱相當優雅精緻。</p>
<p>最好的地方是孟德蘭，祗有四十二個座位，飲酒的美金三元五角至四元五角。</p>
<p>食品無一不是昂貴，房屋奇缺。上海二十萬猶太籍難民仍舊居住在虹口區一帶，還有少數的人祗得住在難民所。所有的上海人之中，猶太人最感前途茫茫。他們夢想美國，就好比忠厚的　國人夢想天堂一般。</p>
<p>失了偽幣　丟了性命</p>
<p>金錢對於上海人，是一個最　尬的問題。你必得携帶一大包一大包僞幣，連小孩子乞丐手裏都有一大把僞幣，報紙上說：一個老年店員，爲　他的四千萬元僞幣遺忘在三輪車上，竟受驚而斃命。我一計算，這筆款子只合美金一百三十三元而已。這使我不由得不爲之悲憫。</p>
<p>沙丁事件　耐人尋味</p>
<p>通貨膨漲，是交易的致命障礙。上海有一件奇妙的事，一箱沙丁魚賣出買進，經過二十個人手，從而人人獲利。</p>
<p>後來一個精明人開了一聽，又開了幾聽，一看，裏面都是壞了的。上了當，便把最末一個出售者喚來，大加賣駡。</p>
<p>出售者喊道：「你把它們開了嗎？天啊！這些沙丁魚，不是吃的，是爲了買來賣去的啊！」</p>
<p>無聲無閱　　惹是非</p>
<p>上海不是美國爾街，當局方面自不必加以鐵密的防備。市政府的參議，一邊忙於熱騰騰的杯盤交錯，一邊正努力於市政的推行，當然中國人對於工作，是需要舒齊的。</p>
<p>上海還有一類有趣的人物，那就是戰敗了的日人，他們無聲無閱地只想過一種不敢惹是非的上海生活。</p>
<p>但是，苦惱雖多，上海人還是抱着賭博者一般的樂觀氣氛，相信總有一天換到同花，而　進一筆大財。一個美國商人對我嘮叨了半小時之久。我問他：上海這個大都市，究竟還有它的將來沒有呢？他伏下身子，按住我的肩頭，低聲說道：「好朋友！上海應該是爲着歷史的繁榮而存在的！」（時代周刋的翰華克著，本報編譯室譯）</p>

<h3 id="c46">中國「反對黨」的問題 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 黎耐菴</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>有人說，中國國民黨是執政黨，現在的共產黨是反對黨。這樣說法，似乎一方面反映中國已經民主了，而另一方面承認共產黨的一切行動也巳具備了反對黨的資格。但，究竟中國目前的反對黨有沒有眞已具備民主國家反對黨本身的條件？這倒是値得研討的問題。</p>
<p>因此，我首先得聲明一句：我是沒有任何黨見的人，也並不反對中國有反對黨存在，無寗因爲我正是一個酷愛民主的人，對反對黨的存在正熱烈她企望它更能成長，從正軌的政爭道路去發展它本身更偉大的事業。我們現在所要討論和研究的問題，就是：反對黨本身應循着何種道路，以及怎樣才眞配呌「反對黨」？</p>
<p>事實是很明顯的。顧名思義，反對黨就是站於執政黨的對立地位，在不違背國家民族生存利益的條件之下，用公正態度，去批判現行政府的政綱政策，使國家走上了更正軌，更幸福之途，而另一方面，就可同時宣傳它自身的主張，爭取人民的擁護，以發展它的力量。這在歐美的多黨國家，都有着很好例證。英國張伯倫內閣對德妥協政策的垮台和邱吉爾次戰主張的更進了一步，美國於一九四〇年放棄中立與軍火自遝的辦法，這都足證明有了反對黨存在的良好收穫。自然的，一切事情沒有客觀的嚴格批判，便沒有主觀者的警惕，政爭也不能例外。在民主國家的政治進化史上，我們當然不能否認反對黨的功績。不過，反對黨所採取的反對手段是不是針對每一政綱或政策的缺點，是不是適合國家民族的情况？這却是値得我們思索探討的。爲着要有事實的比較，我們確認歐美的民主國家的反對黨，是只有從國會的爭辯裏和報紙的論壇上去表現它反對的政見。那末，我們就把眼光移到中國來看一看：中國究竟是不是有反對黨存在？</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>不必諱飾的，中國國民黨，是現在中國的執政黨。而就算像一般人所說，共產黨是中國目前的反對黨，那末要問這個反對黨究竟做了些什麼大事？</p>
<p>從北伐以後到現在，二十年來，中國國民黨所採行的政綱和政策，我們不必爲諱，它本身或許有着相當的錯誤和缺點，這正和一個大家庭的主持者一樣，爲着它本身主管的家庭迭次遭遇了損失和災害，正努力於破壞後的整理工作，自然少不了有許多顧此失彼的地方，這是事實。反對黨站在它的正當立塲，我們當然不能苛求它對執政黨的某些缺點應該完全原諒，相反的，我們正希望它眞能代表民衆，隨時指出這些缺點所在和補救方法，讓執政黨本身有努力改進的機會。</p>
<p>譬如說：共產黨天天說國民黨的政策這也不對，那也不合，或且說這個人貪汚，那個人舞弊。那末，政策不對的理由在什麼地方，應該採取那一種方法去改正？貪汚的事實如何？舞弊的證據何在？只要是有事實，有調查，主張合理，論證確鑿，即使國民黨不重靦，人民一定都會重視的。可是人民不能容許反對黨只顧惡意抨擊，或甚至企圖內亂。誰不願見政治馬上上軌道？共產黨黨員有的是嘴巴，亦有機關報紙，儘可公開議論，讓人民去老慮批判，讓政府去採擇改善，這才是合理的反對手段。我相信執政的國民黨，它在民主潮流中也不會限制共產黨的發言權的。因爲政府旣經承認了共產黨的存在，共產黨自有其政治地位，國民參政會及行將召集的政治協商會議裹部有共產黨的代表參加。這顯然證明國民黨並不採取絕不接受批判的熊度。無論怎樣，國民黨斷不是存心姑縱貪汚壞蛋的人，我們拿抗戰以來的事實作證，國民黨正在努力懲辦貪汚，澄淸吏治，而國民黨的勤求民隱，隨時修正其政策，以求適應時代的需要，這是有目共覩的。</p>
<p>以中國幅員之大，人民之衆，地帶冷熱不同，人性馴暴亦異。汪逆兆銘的父親當年斷不曾敎兒子長大去當漢奸；相信毛澤東先生的令尊亦沒有想到毛先生會幹一輩子的共產黨。從這些事實，我們得平心想一下，國民黨縱有不良份子存在，但共產黨本身又怎樣呢？是否個個都是聖賢呢？各問良心，各憑天理，讓國民自由說句話吧。給毛先生統治了八年的延安，到底比重慶好了多少？有沒有貪汚，有沒有刼奪？租稅是不是老百姓甘心情願？老百姓是不是都准自由講話？這需要毛先生輩自己考察。重慶可以拿共產黨的書籍在街上走？可以讓新華日報以共產黨機關報姿態出現，對國民政府大肆攻訐，而在延安却不見有中央日報或其他民間報紙或書刊的出版。陝甘寗邊區有高喊民主的政府，爲甚麼容不了其他各黨各派？局朝貴等一千餘人是誰所殺？各種各式的捐獻又是誰在剝削老百姓？共產黨對中央站在反對黨的立塲，爲甚麼不在他自己霸佔割據的區域不許有它的反對黨存在？自己面前顧不到，而專在抨擊政敵，這樣的政爭，能取信於人民麼？</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>其次，就論到政爭的問題來。　「政爭」這兩個字眼，很顯明是說政治的鬥爭，而不是軍閥時代和專制時代的地盤戰爭。這問題，小舉生都能够明白。政爭的主要條件，是把黨的理論和事實，去影響或感動了羣衆，使羣衆信仰黨的主張。特別是在野的反對黨，它應該更處處表現它的主張是合理和正確，同時設法以事實來證明未來的政策。這樣，才有着眞正的反對力量。在美國每一次大選期，黨與黨的政論是怎樣的激烈，但它們始終沒有把黨的地位抬高到國家民族利益之上，也沒有把軍隊來作爲政爭的工具。爲甚麼呢？就是一切政爭並不許違背國家的生存利益；而軍隊是國家的，更不許一個政黨如同一個軍閥一樣，把軍隊視爲私有。假如違反了這個原則，政爭必定化爲兵爭，執行國家命令的中央政府，祗有負起戡平內亂的責任來了。只要一讀美國南北戰爭時期的歷史與林肯大總統的傳記，就可思過半矣。</p>
<p>中國呢？我們憑良心說一句，中國國民黨的政策縱有不對，甚至不好，但擺在我們目前的，他至少推翻了滿淸，打倒了軍閥，抵抗了暴敵，收復了失地，廢除了不平等條約，把中國的國際地位提高，這些都是鐵的事實。說他專政到底麼？國民黨並沒有限制着各黨各派的合法活動，更沒有像共產黨所崇拜的極權主義一樣不准有異黨存在。而共產黨本身呢？苦幹了二十年，對國家民族的裨益究竟在那裏？抗戰以前的十年騷擾，國家所蒙的損書如何？江西的瑞金到底一片灰，老百姓永遠肥憶着，就是從共黨自己所誇耀的「二萬五千里長征」歷史來看，這流竄所過的地方，老百姓至今餘痛猶存。共產黨也曾說「孫中山先生的三民主義，爲中國今日所必需，吾黨願爲其實現而奮鬥」。但從民國二十六年九月間說了這句話以後，共產黨的樹建就是陝甘寗邊區所謂「抗日政府」，而其結果，則一分抗日，二分對付國民黨，七分壯大自己的力量，於是擴充軍隊，割據地盤，天天做那反統一的運動。而抗戰勝利後呢，請問共產黨幹些甚麼事；攻城、奪地、破壞交通、刼掠民衆、煽惑暴動、造成社會不安，這難道都算是民主國家黨與黨的「政爭」方法嗎？世界上的多黨國家多得很，爭政權亦不止中國共產黨，而何以事無他例？羅斯福是戚爾基的政敵，他們在選舉鬥爭中爭得多麼激烈，可是威爾基落選了，以威氏的勢力，爲甚麼不跟羅斯福總統的民主黨來一番如中國共產黨一樣的破壞交通，攻城作亂呢？邱吉兩一且大功吿成，而選舉失敗，安安靜靜的讓阿特里的工黨上台執政，並沒有擁兵割據，而英國工黨當其競爭選舉時也並不來一番暴動破壞呀！</p>
<p>上面已經說過：政爭不是軍閥的地盤戰爭，無論怎樣政爭的雙方都應該以國家的利益爲利益。共產黨旣不能提出正確的政論使人信仰，而且自己承認中國今天應實行三民主義不能施行共產主義，却硬是要用軍事的行動來爭取地盤和政權，簡直就失去民主政黨從事政爭的資格。誰也不能看出來與過去的軍閥有什麼兩樣！</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>反對黨是民主政治的照明燈，就應該具備照明燈的風格。中國國民黨旣未反對共產黨的存在，言論政見和它的前途，儘可由共產黨自己去發展。雖然在野黨與執政黨或可有不同的地方，可是現在共產黨旣自命爲站在反對黨的地位，就應該把自己的本身缺點去糾正，把老百姓的生命看重一點，把國家的體面和權益看重一點，立即放棄暴動攻城的割據政策，改變破壞交通損毀工礦的自殺政策，停止再向國家軍隊襲擊，取消合法政府以外的政權，首先服從國家的政令和軍令，用事實去努力表現黨的主張，然後才能取得老百姓的信仰。政黨的主要目標，無非要求國家民族政治進步，使老百姓都過得好生活，那末，就應該看淸國家今日的現狀，不要害打了八年苦戰的貧困團家，又害了內亂病。我們相信民主政治是要一步一步前進的，單靠用槍打仗，爭地流血，使國家分裂，是不曾產生民主的！假如共產黨是眞正愛好民主的話，我覺得首先請敎他們，應該問問中國國民：究竟有多少人願意把中國交給共產黨來做共產主義的試騐品？</p>
<p>中國現在已掀起了熱烈的民主思潮，我們相信中國國民黨也正努力於民主政治建設。自然，我們同時也企望有着一個理想的反對黨存在。可是我們所企求的反對黨，必須它本身所採取政爭的方式，絕對以國家民族的利益爲前提。爲着要政治進步，我們希望這個反對黨，在不暴動作亂和服從國家政令軍令之下，鬥爭得更劇烈，更實際，使中國的政治能因而更淸明更進步。而今天的中國共產黨能不能符合這個條件呢？這就得看中國共產黨好自爲之！（三十四年，十二月，十一日，龍潭）</p>

<p>戰前香港對外交通極便。英，美，日等輪船公司均有定期貨運載客輪船開往歐洲。太平洋方面香港有美，加，日等航綫，香港與非洲，澳洲和南美也有交通關係。在附近海洋方面，香港和印度，爪哇，台灣，越南，日本和中國港岸綫各港埠經常有海上交通。</p>
<p>香港已成爲主要的航運中心，其情形可從一九三七年海洋和內河輪船出入香港共達三萬三千七百八十二艘（的三千六百萬噸）一事中窺見之。這數字甚至較一九三三和三四年上海出入船隻噸數爲大，或許較日本的主要港口神戶還要大。進入香港的海洋輪船中英國船佔半數弱。</p>
<p>據統計進入香港的船隻洋海輪船佔其中噸數三分之二，其餘大部爲內河輪船。帆船等數量雖多，然而在噸數上說來它僅佔其中的小部份。</p>
<p>位於島與大陸間的香港海港形成一個天然的船隻碇泊處。大陸上的碼頭和其他碇泊設備僅容納長逾七百呎的稱船十二艘。香港有各種航運需要的港灣設備，其便利正和世界上其他現代化港口同。在一九三七年，香港有總共能容納貨物五十萬噸的貨倉公司三家，此外港九各地還有很多私人貨倉。香港毫無缺乏各種儲藏貨物設備之虞。兩大修船廠都有足能容納長逾七百八十七呎的乾船塢；此外且有能够容留待修船隻（長逾三百九十呎，重四千團）的滑道五處。其他較小的修船廠亦能修理噸數較輕的船隻。（譯自外國貿易周列）</p>

<p>— 重伯</p>
<p>大致漲多跌少</p>
<p>金融　上週本市金融，銀綫業明拆穩定於三角，暗拆在八分至一角間徘徊，惟因中外股票及黃金美鈔挺升，脚地漸堅，來週爲陽歷歲尾，銀根顯將趨緊，烚赤先傳美鈔比率看高，步升至七十六萬元，旋因出口貨頗多，及港幣新貨大跌，賣氣見緊，低峯到七十萬元，卒以銀根鬆動，華股外股向上，買氣重振，回高至七十五萬二千元收盤，比前週漲二萬二千元，業中人對美鈔掛定後之見解，認爲黃金亦將呆定於某一階段，共情形與職前即二十五六年金價穩定於一千一百元左右者同，因此大胆開始下午隔日期貨交易，惟穩健金商尙在觀望，故下午交易淸淡，銀樓飾金掛牌每兩升二千元，紋銀呆定於六百元，銀幣每枚四百五十元，與前週同，美鈔因進出口貨物漸暢，多空需求平衡，往來於一千一百七十元至一千二百八十元間，最後堅站一千二百五十五元，較前週漲三十五元，港幣老貨平定，新貨有三成作價之說，週三賣戶紛起，由六十五元直隊至四十五元，漸以航業中人及廣帮英商逢跌購進，回升五六十元收盤，比前週仍跌九元。</p>
<p>證券　統一公債由於時局樂觀，銀行界搜購，多頭乘機擠軋，且散佈孫票還本及勝利津貼金消息，致丙種高峯竟見八百五十元，超過票面七百五十元之鉅，引起證券帮多頭獲利轉賣，退至七百元收盤，比前週尙漲一百元，華股因游資鬆濫，烚赤美鈔升降極微，無可活動，紛集股市，銀錢業及多頭公司購進，益以實業領袖要求開放華股交易，以振興國內實業，致買氣蓬勃，大小熱門股各漲四·五成不等，領袖之永安紗廠股因紗市活潑，買戶集中，竟以新高價七百十元收盤，較前週大漲二百二十五元，外股因外廠陸續開工，及猶太鉅商購進，會得豐漲五成餘，怡和紗廠漲四成，來週爲陽曆年底，中外股票均有新高價收盤景象。</p>
<p>貨物　商品方面，食米因常熟，無錫等產米區均在收買軍糧，禁止外運，到貨稍稀，益以本街及食尸添購，每市石漲五百至一千元，粳米站七千至八千元，秈米六千五百至七千八百元，傳進口法商洋行有訂購越米僅合滬市四千元之說，過去本市仰賴秈米維持景况將復見，麵粉因小麥挺升，及明正開征麥粉統稅，廠商成本提高，買戶活躍，南北客帮爭先購進，雖有善後總署慈善平價美麵粉萬包出售，每包僅一千九百元，但市上中國一號粉仍在漲至三千元，較前週大漲七百五十元，佔全價四分之一，來週全市將有第二期平價麵粉零售，同時美麥不斷進口，世界不復有戰爭，可信粉價不致無限昂　，雜糧因水陸運費影饗，一致趨漲，大體黃豆漲四五百元，花生米漲三四千元，苞米漲三百元，食油依原料大豆花生爲進退，每百斤連帶漲起二千元，豆油反比生油昂一成弱，原因爲生油凍而賣相不佳，食糖因全市發售平價台灣白糖，每市斤三百六十元，市上赤白糖買戶寥寥，每担各跌三四千元。紡織品因四川帮漢口帮動辦棉紗棉布，前者集中於二十支十六支紗，漲六七萬元，後者獨看重十二磅龍頭白細布，每疋猝漲五千元，棉花受廠家及花號搜購，通州細絨由四萬升至六萬元，火機花亦高至四萬元，比前週各漲一二萬元，如以二十支雙馬紗六十四萬對照，仍爲十一担花衣掉紗一包。絲市因對美輸出，高級白廠經漲九萬元，輯里乾經獨平。人造絲因綢廠工潮解決，廠需增加，一百廿號天橋每箱漲八萬元，爲五十三萬元，綢椴中美亞被面最俏，每百條漲四萬五千元，其餘平平。茶葉雖有歐美出口商問訊，惟市價尙鮮蘋刺激，僅中檔紅茶漲一千五百元，餘均稍軟，燃料品受天寒影響，買戶增加，陽泉白謀塊漲六萬元，每噸重見三十萬元，其餘小子。烟塊。烟屑。各漲五千至一萬元，煤球平定，柴爿因犬雨銷滯，栗柴見新低價一千二百元，松柴每担且祗九百元。日用品中，洋燭因川帮搜購，每箱漲三千五百元，火柴肥皂亦各升一二千元，捲烟因永泰和提英美烟派貨價，及歲闌年禮需要，老刀仙女大英各升七萬至十七萬五千元，尤以老刀牌爲俏。此外紙張西藥及工業原料，各有一成漲風，化妝品獨平疲。</p>

<h3 id="c50">資本在法律上之地位 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>資本爲工商企業唯一之先決條件，蓋營利事業必須有原始投入之資本，方可運用生利，其數量必須以金錢計算，並當有確定之金額記明於賬册，故其組織不論爲合夥或公司，除獨資經營者，僅須個人斟酌一已之財力，自由運用外，均應將資本額訂明於契的或章程，以爲共同契的內容之決定，其對外則不論組織如何，皆須有確定之資本額，向主管官署聲請登記後，方可對抗第三者，遇有增資或减資亦同，考之商業登記法，公司法及營業稅法所得稅法，蓋莫不如是也，</p>
<p>所得稅法，且於施行細則第八條更爲詳盡之規定曰，『本法稱資本者，謂照公司組織實在繳足之股金，或其他組織實際投入之本金，』又云『前項資本不包含信用或勞務之出資，』其第四十四條曰，『第一類甲乙兩項營利事業之資本，應於開業後十五日內申請當地主管征收機關調查核准登記之，其資本有增减時，應於增减日起十五日內申請之，』資本之爲實際投入，而可以金錢計數之本金，及其經過登記後。方可對抗第三者，至爲明顯，在民法及公司法上之無限責任股東，不禁勞務及信用之出資，規　其必須佔計爲金錢價値，作爲資本，是不啻以股東應投入之金錢，代以價値相等之共他財產矣。</p>
<p>資本投入之代以金錢以外之財產者，其估價標準公司法及所得稅法等取締甚嚴，在估定作股以後，股東即不能在將來要求收回此項原財產，經營者亦不能强以此原財產返還原股東，在企業之財產爲共有的，一經成爲資本，即已與其他財產合併，而為資本總額，更不能指出某一部份係某股東來股所運用，而獨歸責於此某股東也，今之談整理賬面資本額者，頗斤斤於新老股東之應分別計算，其意以爲當初之以法幣投入者値錢，在僞中儲券投入者不値錢，因而主張偽幣出資部份，須多打折頭，甚且有主張依照中央政府收兌市面上現在流通之偽幣辦法，謂須以二百作一折換其資本額者，抑不知險少數特特之公司行號外，其於法幣老股本外加收偽幣新股本時，其偽幣并朱如現在之不値錢也，其收入之偽幣，早已和成資本之總額，變成其他財產，安可以現在之僞幣購買力相比擬，吾人如不認僞幣爲合法之通貨，期在當初收入作股時，其性質似與金錢以外之其他財產出資相同，法律上並不許可經營者能强以股東出資時之原財產返還原股東也。</p>
<p>至於資本金額之成立，必須向主管官署登記，始得對抗第三者，全爲在法律上取得對外地位而設，股東內部，則無論爲合夥爲公司，一經依法決議，訂立合夥議據，股束會決議錄，及塡寫認股書，繳納股款錢、其契約行為已經成立，縱有怠於登記情事，亦不過受課以罰金，甚至加行爲人以徒刑而已，初不廣棄其股東對於合夥或公司之出資關係之成立，遇有增加資本，而未經完成登記手績者，亦同，在淪陷區未收復前，設立及變更登記之無從申請辦理者比比，此爲環境上之不可抗，更不能抹殺其事實，於合夥及公司對於股東內部契的之不生動搖，亦屬當然之情事也，今之談整理帳面資本金額者，主張法重法律，此爲法治精神，自値得擁護，但亦當知『內部契的』行爲之應受法律之保陣也，若乃增資减資辦理過程上之有違法行爲者，則爲另一問題，可另謀法律之救濟，不可據以抹殺一般的事實。</p>
<p>或以所得稅關係，謂今年須補繳，應將其帳面資本整理至較大之額，以圖减低稅率，是亦不然，觀於上文所列之所得稅法，資本之增加，須登記後發生效力，依施行細則第三十七條至第三十九條之規定，其資本額須根據已申報之額，全年平均計算，若僅於年終抬高，依法並不能减低共稅率也。</p>

<h3 id="c65">本市各區土地業主　應迅速辦理登記　錢市長昨發書面談話 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>本市錢市長爲督率推進地政工作，並使市民對土地登記法規，及時間手續諸問題，能深切明瞭起見，特發表書面談話如後：</p>
<p>一切手續簡易迅捷</p>
<p>「土地登記乃法律所規定，意在保障人民權益。滬市在抗戰期間，必多地欋糾紛，是以舉辦登記，亦爲淸理糾紛之要務·儿在黃浦·閘北。引翔。滬南·漕涇·法華等六區內，戰前已領有執業證者，可逕行聲請換發土地所有權狀，手續簡易迅捷。共未經登記者，應一律辦理登記。地政局規定自本年十一月十九日起，至三十五年一月十八日止，爲登記收件時期。如在規定期內，業主有特殊事故，不能依限聲請登記者，可聲明原因，得延期一月，辦理登記。</p>
<p>公告期內亦可登記</p>
<p>至業主已經辦理登記之土地，經地政局審核無誰後，則揭示公告兩個月，公告期滿，其產權確無異議者，即發給土地所有權狀。故土地登記必經手續，最速須在二三個月以上。在登記收件時，由地政局掣給收據，惟市民容有認兩個月收件期間過於短促者，要知在規定期滿後，未及登記之土地，尙須經過公告程序，在此公告期內，亦可補行聲請登記。如渝越公告時期，而無正當理由聲述，又不聲請登記者，即由政府代管，在代管期內，自抗戰結束後兩年中，仍可爲產權之登記。故依法代管，並非沒收人民之產權，此爲登記技術之程序，故希望市民迅速登記。</p>
<p>按照規定徵收費用</p>
<p>關於收取土地登記費，俱屬遵照中央規定辦理，凡聲請爲第一次土地所有權登記者，登記費照申報地價收取千分之四。凡聲請爲土地權利取得設定移轉變更或消滅之登記者，一律按照權利價値收取千分之二。將來發給土地所有權狀，及土地他項權利證明書時，每張照產權價値，從一百至一萬元計算。騐契照中央規定，從契價徵收百分之六至百分之十五，此係中央稅收，本府權爲暫行辦理而已。</p>
<p>至如辦理地政主要負責人員，俱屬專家，係由中央地政署，及各省市地政機關所調派者。其餘工作人員，亦均熟悉地政情形，咸具廉明迅捷和藹之服務精神，必能有以完成此項任務」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司，於昨晨六時四十五分，突發生怠工事件。所有已出廠之電車，皆回廠停駛。社會局得悉後，當即派朱承浩前往調解。第三方面軍亦派員勸導，遂於九時半全體很工。勞資雙方由社會局居間調停。</p>
<p>工潮醖釀已民非一日</p>
<p>據記者探息，工潮醖釀已久，該公司自英商愛白樂克氏接收以來，因經濟困難，故九月，十月，十一月，三個月來，全體職工三千餘人之薪水，皆延欠未發。每人只借過三萬元許，職工早已不滿，曾數度推派代表，與資方接洽，要求發給三月來之欠薪。車務部。機務部，工人千餘，聞曾於二十一日上午十一時，在培開爾路聚集四百餘人，因一言誤會，將賣票代表四百三十二號唐義芳毆打成傷。並於二十二日下午一時半許，機務部銅匠亦因工資問題，意見不同，發生爭吵打架，結果銅匠一名因傷致死。</p>
<p>待遇不平要求調整</p>
<p>公司當局恐事態擴大，設法向中央銀行籌借得一萬五千萬元。於前日已將欠薪發給。但車務部撬路，司機，賣票，工人千餘，因工資較其他各部職員爲低，認爲以公司當局對職工待遇不平，要求調整，乃於昨晨發生怠工風潮。當由公用局趙曾珏局長，及社會局朱承浩氏，組保下午三時由資方答復，因而復工。</p>
<p>工人接受當局調解</p>
<p>昨下午一時左右，即有職工代表十二人，至社會局，英商電車公司總經理愛白樂克氏，亦偕會計主任哈威氏到塲，由社會局張振遠科長，及朱承浩氏努力調解，並切實向職工代表申述當局爲勞工謀福利之苦心，代表頗受感動，允許轉向全體工友說明。職工所提出要求公司將全部職員薪給公佈，亦已由資方允許於星期三發表，屆時再由職工提出工資　整之具體辦法，交社會局負責寫理。</p>

<p>民生公司民裕輸，突於前晨沉沒於黃浦江濱三號碼頭，昨正忙於打撈工作，其業經起出之貨，計有棉紗，棉布，雜貨，柴油十餘桶，皆堆置於三號碼頭岸上。惟該船所裝客貨，共四百六十餘件，昨日起出者，尙不及半數，且最可惜者，歐爲新裕紗廠及鹹孚公司經理曾伯康所捐贈北碚圖書館之</p>
<p>大批叢書</p>
<p>上週民權輸開出，已先有一批七十餘箱裝去，此番係啓運第二批五十餘箱，（尙有一百餘箱未運出），竟遭此刦，殊屬不幸。迄昨日爲止，起貨工作，尙未完畢，今日仍須繼續進行，預計明日可使該輪浮出水面，據該公司負責人告稱：由於民裕輪之下沉，該公司</p>
<p>損失重大</p>
<p>該輪撈起後，勢將再度入塢大修。對乘客部分，業經商就辦法，如欲即日赴渝者，可搭廿四日啓椗之民族輪赴宜昌轉渝，否則可於限定時期內，改乘民生公司其他輪隻前往。至旅客損失行李等物，昨日已先辦理登記，一俟起出，將分別發還。至肇禍之</p>
<p>責任問題</p>
<p>據聞已告查明，對疏忽人員，公司當局將予懲處，該船船長王福成及理貨主任曾憲章，涉有相當過失，已予扣押。俟該輸出水查明責任後，再予決定。又出事時殉職失蹤之領江陳海山，係漢口人，年已六十歲，服務多年，公司當局以該員過往頗著勞績，不幸慘死，對之將從優撫恤。至其屍身正在打撈中，且通知海關及水上警察局等。另一受傷之船警趙志誠，爲四川人，年三十餘歲，經施救後，可無性命之虞。</p>

<p>— 邁天</p>
<p>勝利後的第一個聖誕節，明天就要降臨，大家似乎會比往年加倍的興奮些，購辦禮物，計劃宴會，來大大的狂歡一下。可是事實上，今年的聖誕節，和戰前的比較起來，仍將遜色不少呢。</p>
<p>「大戰之後，人們元氣大喪，多少人在今天連一件寒衣還無法添置，多少人榜徨在街頭，找不到樓枝。不要說貧民階級，即連一部分中等人家，米缸時常見底，油罐內空無所有。那裏還有資格來享受快樂？在這裏，聖誕祇是若干有限階級的人所專利的佳節。可是有限階級畢竟是有限的。不是嗎？你會發現百貨公司內買花花綠絲禮物的人，大大的不如往年熱閙。雖然今年舶來品缺乏，無從點綴，但即是在少數佑置得鮮艷奪目的樹窗外，觀衆也是寥寥可數。裝扎得非常漂亮的花籃洋酒，花色特多，可是問津的人却未見踴躍。靜安寺路，霞飛路，花店門口聖誕樹上排成長條，不過也不像以前那樣走過小沙渡路，靜安寺路時，像走進公園一般的「鬱鬱蒼蒼」哩。</p>
<p>話又得說回來，聖誕節到了，能鬆一口氣，盡情歡娛的還是不願錯過這機會。跳舞塲。咖啡館·餐室。戲院。無疑的將擠得水洩不通。不少的舞憲。菜館。已給人包了下來。聖誕大菜無論多貴，也已定去了許多客，不過也有幾家西菜館準備大犧牲，祗加菜而不加價。雖然，據氣象台報告，聖誕節也許無雪景點綴，但舞塲·菜館·茶室·內的樂隊，早已奏着「白色的聖誕節」佳曲來迎接聖誕了。此外還有許多人乘這難得的佳節，去杭州·蘇州。旅行，這倒是一件很有意思的事。</p>
<p>聖誕節在中國人眼裏，還不算一件懿歟盛事，可是在洋人們郤是大不相同，聖總節比過新年還重要。美軍的百貨商店，及中國的古董刺繡舖子內，早在數星期前即有大批聖誕禮物運到美國去。但美國兵們也都認爲東西太貴，不想多買。、英國紅十字會舉行了四次的宴會，招待留滬的歐洲兒童們。美國的紅十字會要在江灣機塲邀請二十五個中國兒童參加聖誕會，並分發糖菓禮物。英國新聞處贈送全體職員的禮物特別豐富，每人可得一大紙箱，內有香烟糖菓各種東西。美國紅十字會將由印度加爾各答運來七萬五千包禮物，送給中國區內的英國將士們。上海英軍的「派對」將分佈各處，罐頭火鷄也早已運到。聰說警察局已答應英軍方面的請求，今晚的宵禁暫行鬆弛。因之通宵的「派對」多數已經在籌備中了　最後，我誠意的代那些在戰時失去了爹娘的孩子們，向聚誕老人呼籲，能否請他老人家今年改變方針，轉移目標，到貧民窟去佈施一趟！</p>
<h3 id="c74">本市各工廠　裝原動機　減除煤斤困難 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>據中國技術協會調查，因煤斤供給困難，電力短少，上海市各工廠乃不得不自行設法裝置原動機，總計　四七八度，合一〇九一六匹馬力。其中屬於木炭氣機者為三六四座，共六七六一匹馬力。柴油機四九座，九二一匹馬力。蒸氣機六五座，共三二三四匹馬力。裝置該項原動機之工廠，種類分爲（一）機器及五金鐵工廠，（二）棉鐵及毛織廠，（三）絹絲及織綢廠，（四）化學藥廠，（五）香烟廠，（六）染廠，（七）印刷廠，（八）紗廠，（九）雜糧及磨粉廠，（十）橡膠廠，（十一）造紙廠，（十二）煤球廠，（十三）製革廠，（十四）針織廠，（十五）翻砂廠。其中以機械廠之七九具爲最多，棉織廠之六二具次之。除崇信紗廠之蒸汽機五具，係戰前奘製外，其餘均爲最近兩年內所裝置者。各工廠奘置原動機之結果，乃使電力廠之煤斤恐慌問題爲之减輕。過去電力廠月需煤斤十五萬噸現則每月八萬噸已可解決矣。</p>
<h3 id="c75">機械業復工委會　主持六廠復工 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>經濟部蘇浙皖特派員辦公處機械組，現已組成一機械業復工指導委員會，由李泰雲氏任主任委員，內分五組，（一）財務，（二）總務，（三）廠務，（四）勞務，（五）業務，經該委員會主持下復工之機械工廠有，（一）日亞鋼業廠，製造竹節鋼，（三）興亞鋼業廠，鑄工塲，製造自來水管及鐵管，（三）日信工廠，製造彈子培林，（四）中華製針廠，（五）東亞鐵工廠，製造脚踏車零件，（六）昌和製作所，製造全部脚踏車材料。其餘接收後之機械工廠，正在積極修置中，因上述六工廠之復工，本市機械工人之失業問題，已獲部份解決。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市公用局公共汽車公司籌備會，已決定繼南市一路圓路公共汽車後，另闢市區一綫，此綫將依前公共租界之九路公共汽車路綫行駛，即自北京東路起，經中山東路。中山中路，折入愚園路，而直達中山公園前爲止。全程分配汽車二十至三十輛，此項車輛已由公用局第一第二兩修理廠於本月初開始改造，預定明年一月間當可正式行駛。</p>
<h3 id="c77">市財局負責人談　徵收營業稅眞相　並無處罰二十倍情事 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>近聞中央兩宣慰使根據商人陳述，爲本市營業稅事，電陳中央：（一）營業稅尙未移交直接稅局。（二）直接稅局公告，遵照部令，自本年十月二十一日起征。（三）財局不但補征十月二十一日以前之營業稅，且對逾限未交之各商號處二十倍之罰款，事關政令與民意，請予裁奪等語。經向滬市財局及市商會探詢究竟，據財局負責人稱：（一）營業稅從前本係地方稅，中央在滬一向未曾收過，自直接稅局成立，市府正與財部洽商，是否委託地方代收，俾機構現成，省時節費，情形熟習，事半功倍。往返磋商，迄今猶未定奪，以是尙未移交。（二）直接稅局直字第二十九號公告，係稱自本局成立之日起征，十月二十一日係該局成立之日，市府與各局係九月十二日成立，在此稅未移交，該局未成立前，自仍應屬諸地方。（三）營業稅係按季征收，偽組織時有已繳者，有未繳者，旣未便將已繳者代爲發還，為求公平合理，則祇有對未繳者予以補收，一面查明偽組織之稅率低於我中央之所規定，爲體恤民艱，仍依原稅率辦理，其實當時各商號之營業賬面爲偽鈔，旣依原率課稅，復按二百作一折合法幣，爲數實至有限。計連春夏季共祇四千三百餘萬，合尙不及娛樂筵席等稅，現時一個月收數三分之一與四分之一，乃純屬整頓淸理起見，並無增民負担之意。（四）逾限處罰二十倍一節，查係半倍至五倍，乃按照營業稅法規定辦理，並無處罰二十倍之事。有之，則僅商人代偽組織所收未繳之消費特稅。因商人已向消費者代征，一再催收，遲不照繳，將無異吞沒公款，是以高其處罰，期早清結，實際依限，俱亦照繳，並無若干被罰者。以上各節，詢之商會，稱亦屬實云。</p>

<h3 id="c92">國畫精神與民族正氣 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>國畫可以陶冶性情，感化人類，精靈微妙，不僅在技巧之訓練，尤在品格之修養，故歷代著名畫家，皆有超逸之品格，冲穆之神情，我中華民族和平淡泊之精神，充分發揮之於國畫，感發興起，足使縱慾昧理，貪利忘義之人，有所警惕而悔悟。唐吳道子作「地獄變相圖」，使罟屠之流，畏罪改業，其感化力有如此。其他宗敎化之佛畫，抒情之山水畫，歷史性之人物畫，審美之花卉動物畫，莫不莊嚴淳厚，溫和忠實，引人入勝，發人深省，有不可思義之妙。</p>
<p>國畫旣蘊藏此微妙精神，久而久之，遂成普遍深刻之風雅觀念；上自帝王將相，下至士夫學子，爭相學習，以嗚風雅，蔚爲民族文化之奇花異果，每遇外侮侵凌，民族巔危之際，潔身之士，悠然引退，而其忠誠熱烈之報國情緒，全部寄託之於畫，舉凡蒼勁不屈之松柏，馨香習習之幽蘭，潔白無瑕之寒梅，堅貞守節之翠竹，孤芳自賞之霜菊，不染紅塵之山水，不食烟火之人物，皆成國畫題材之對象，象徵其崇高忠貞之愛國思想。遯跡山林，幽閒自在，表面上似頗消極，實則抱此不合作態度，庽情於畫，喚醒國人，如元季之四大家，明季之倪元璐，鄭所南輩，忠義奮發，正氣磅礴，其眷　故國之情，橫溢楮墨，不特使當時靦顏事仇之奸僞警惕，即千秋萬世之後人，展卷怦然，聞風景仰，予人以嚴正不阿之感覺，堪與効命疆塲之民族英雄，同其功勳。</p>
<p>國畫足以表達民族正氣，旣如此深切偉大，歷史上忠貞畫家之事蹟，又如此其凜不可犯，流風所及，收效至宏，故自抗戰以迄勝利之八年中，淪陷區域之國畫家，均能嚴守崗位，堅苦卓絕，可以不辱故人，即有迫於環境之少數書家，處與委蛇，而表現之於作品者，尙多剩水殘山之感，悲歌慷慨之詞，眷戀故國之心，初未稍減。今者河山重復，天日重光，深盼我國畫界同人，體察國畫有維護民族正氣之獨特精神，義意之深，實居世界藝　之最上層，加强努力，綱續光大，創造優美絕倫之時代作品，流布於全世界，使全人類沉浸濃郁於和平淡汨之中國畫中，瞭明我民族氣節之凛然不可侵犯，消磨一切殘酷猙獰之事，同躋於平等大同之康樂世界。</p>
<h3 id="c93">風雨中的落葉 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>天空中籠罩着一層薄薄的淡墨水，烏雲襯在天際，很像一條變幻莫測的黑龍，又好像一個兇暴駭人的妖魔，做出可怕的樣子，令人見了，不禁深深的吁着悶氣，感到無限的悵惘；風颯颯地吹過，雖不很刺骨裂膚，但嚴冬畢竟是可怕的，它帶來了慄慄冽冽的寒意，使空氣浸浸入了混沌，枯叔，悒鬱的環境裏；加着濛濛的細雨，淅瀝了一個通宵，路上積着許多水潭；淸晨的街頭，人跡很稀少，眞的，這種陰暗苦澀的天色，誰也懶得出外，尤其是這條素來幽僻的馬路，祇有二行凋零的梧桐，悄悄地伴着寒風寂雨，組織成一幅冷僻凄凉的圖畫。</p>
<p>梧桐禿了頂，青綠翠嫩的葉兒，早已看不見她的容顏了！剩在枝頭上一些枯黃的敗葉，經不起嚴風摧殘，伏着，搖着，蹙着眉，愁着臉，正不知還能生存幾許時光，三三兩兩地被吹離了慈母的懷抱，流着淚，依依地飄落到地上，溝裏，水潴裏，在那放晴的天氣，她還能逗留在地面，隨着朔風沙沙地打滾，而今呢？黏附在濕滑的地面上，浸沒在水潴裏，漸漸的漬汚了！等候着人們無情的踐踏；同情的人兒呀！你沒有聽見她最後的哀吟嗎？「慈母呀！爲什麼人們烤着爐火，我在這兒遭受無理的蹂躪呢？」但，朔風苦雨，依然毫不留情地殘害着這羣無辜的小生命，落葉悽惋地片片飄下；祇有還夾着些靑黃的未衰而將敗的葉兒，還勉强依偎在母懷裏，和敵人掙扎，掙扎，期待着最後的命運！</p>
<p>落葉呀！妳別憔悴別餘泣吧！世界上的生物，那一樣不是和妳一般的遭遇呢？即如人們吧！妳以爲他們總是最幸運的了！但是，他們也免不了這樣的厄運，也許會比妳們受到更不幸的遭遇呢？在年富力强朝氣蓬勃的當兒，在聲譽隆盛威力顯赫的當兒，那一種人，那一種環境，不向他諂容獻媚低首下心呢？不向他恭維謙遜錦上添花呢？但到了年老力衰日暮途窮的當兒，陷入聲譽墮落權力消失的當兒，那一種人，那一種環境，不向他譏諷輕視欺侮凌辱呢？不向他驕矜傲悍恣意奚落呢？落葉呀！現在妳雖呻吟在風雨交加的鐵蹄下，妳衰老了！憔悴了！靑春不能重復，嬌容不能常駐；但到了天晴陽光普照着大地，寒風吹乾了妳的身體，自會有那照顧妳的淸道夫，來掃除妳，放入畚箕；也會有那憐惜妳的窶人婦，來收拾妳，放進破筐；雖然，妳的結局還是骯髒的垃圾箱，炎炎的火柴爐；但是，別悲悼別悽愴吧！這樣的結局，至少比那人們在日暮途窮時，受人凌辱，恣意奚落要好些，不，要好得許多，不是嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c94">我控訴！ <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 上官神</p>
<p>且聽我吿訴你」個故事：</p>
<p>在九一八後沒有幾個月，在東北各省的街道上，貼着一張佈吿，招集小工，並沒有註出是建築何物，但在待遇從豐的一項上，吸引了很多失業的同胞。</p>
<p>他們去報名了，報名後沒幾天，就用卡車將他們運到一個大厦前，在深夜裏，那些被矇蔽者，一個個走進大厦去。</p>
<p>就在這大厦裏，他們開始了工作。</p>
<p>工作——是在大廈底下掘個地道，在那裏造着軍火庫。</p>
<p>除一天到晚給他們二餐飯吃外，什麼也沒有，整天的在黝暗的地窖裏挖掘着，堆砌着，一有怠懶，鞭子就在背脊上印烙一條血痕。</p>
<p>有的受不起苦請求退出，他在你臂膝上打一次針，你的眼瞎了，你張着嘴，啞了，你渾身覺得痳痺。</p>
<p>而每天不斷有新的工人招募進來。</p>
<p>三個月過去，一座備有種種秘密設備的軍火窖，完全了。那些經過九十天地獄生活的人們，他們睜着界滿血統的兩眼，互相對視着，等待着，他們內疚覺得自己做了一件錯事，一件錯事現在是完成了，他們不再希望那些殘暴者給他薪水，但願讓他出去，回家去，去吿訴每個中國人；在那堂堂的大厦下是一座將殘殺無數同胞的軍火窖。</p>
<p>他們期望的一天終於到了，幾十個日憲兵將他們從地下引出來，外面暗沉沉的，正是深夜。</p>
<p>把他們趕進卡車裏。十數輛卡車在黑暗中消失了。</p>
<p>一天天過去，在平靜的江面上浮着一塊一塊的血漬。人民好奇地打撈着，屍身浮了上來，不祗一個，十個，百個……</p>
<p>這是他們為日人工作的酬報。</p>
<p>十年的時間，悠忽而過，十年前的血漬，誰也忘不掉，那些被害者的妻子兒女還活着，他們等特着一天，要殺害他們夫父者還償這筆血債。</p>
<p>那些强暴者終於飲了自製的毒鳩，他們得到敎訓，但他們沒有得到應有的報復。</p>
<p>那數千數萬被沉斃在海底的同胞，難道他們的犧牲就算了？</p>
<p>我控訴！</p>
<h3 id="c95">日本猪玀歌 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 徐澤人</p>
<p>日寇於戰爭中，有所謂「文化奉公會」者，這是畫家，音樂家。戲劇家這一類東西到戰塲上去，用他們所善長的技能來鼓勵侵略的組織。民國三十一年時、這個文化奉公會出了一本集子，名稱呌「戰綫點描」，由日本電報通信社出版部出版。全書是二百九十面的十六開一大本，內容是三分之二的圖畫，三分之一的文字，由陸軍省推薦，而由櫻井作序的。書中不用說得，充滿對於我國的侮辱以及日寇的自大。不妨隨便舉個例子，該書一五〇面上半繪了一匹大猪二匹小猪以及二頭鵝。下半是一首猪玀歌道</p>
<p>「黑而且笨的你啊，</p>
<p>當占領吳淞造紙廠之初，</p>
<p>會見的便是你哪！</p>
<p>一想是猪玀眞是喫了一驚。</p>
<p>但是知道了倒也覺得可愛了。</p>
<p>你的主人也是如此的。</p>
<p>你的國家也是如此的。</p>
<p>俺是在拼侖要知道你的事哪』。</p>
<p>作者是呌高澤圭一的傢伙，大抵是個畫家，書中他畫的不少。這個辱駡我們爲猪玀的敵寇，此時也許仍舊在上海，住在漂亮的公寓裏；受着優待，尊敬其爲文化人，要請他出席於茶點會，談談什麼東亞文明呢！</p>
<h3 id="c96">我們需要那一種繪畫？ <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>很多的人在問：現階段的中國，需要那一種繪畫？</p>
<p>國畫家說：我們應該提倡固有藝術，發揚民族文化，現階段是一個建國的時期，國粹是應該保存的，那麼我們便需要國畫了</p>
<p>油畫家說：油畫是有豐富的表現力與科學化的製作方法，在建國階段中，我們畢竟還應該吸取養分，因之，油畫是最需要的一種藝術。</p>
<p>漫畫家說：漫畫是指示大衆，暴露現實的藝術，建國時代大衆應該怎樣走？應該有如何合理的現實，只有漫畫最能祖負這種任務，所以漫畫是當前最需要的一種繪畫了。</p>
<p>在建國階段中，國粹固應保存，外來文化也得吸取，而藝術的正確的主題的把握常然也很需要。但是；國畫的表現力薄弱，汕畫的缺乏中國民族藝術特質，漫畫只有剎那的宣傳性與刺激性，拿來配合建國進程而獲取中國藝術的復興，都是不够的。我認爲，現階段我們需要的一種繪畫是：切合現實的主題，宏渾壯快崇高的氣勢，這是要從漫畫的手法與國畫的精神中擷取出來，然而油畫中的表現力假使不能具備，結果還是會陷於空虛薄弱的。因爲油晝在今日，已經不是西洋人所獨有的藝術，而是世界的藝術，正如飛機，汽軍不是西洋特有的交通工具而爲全人類可以使用的工具了。</p>
<h3 id="c97">光陰 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 田</p>
<p>翻着日曆，紙頁一片一片的飛過去。日子像一條汚獨的水流，一刻不停地流動着。生活，是一團泥，讓汚水染着，變得更汚穢了。</p>
<p>希望更是無窮盡的。日子永遠地有增無減，光陰，過去，不復還，在背後積成了無數量的大堆。一刻沒有喘息地，再迎着眼前飛越過來的。快樂和憂鬱，過去的樊作陳跡了，堆在一起；未來的，是無窮盡的，不能預料的。</p>
<p>笑容像是夢，愁臉却實在地幌現着。人有一種不必要的自私和妬忌，以為歡樂永遠是空虛的，不可捉摸的，而憂鬱，却像劍般的刺入心。當一切都變作陳跡的時候，當寬容大量到這種程度的時候，人也變老了。美貌，靑春，是浮起在輕聲的憾歡中的。臉上的縐紋是生活的軌道，經歷，是光滑的面皮上刻劃了深刻的紋痕，漂亮，動人的，却應沒在逝去的光陰中。靑春僅一度，一切的享受，成了空虛，於是，『唉，人生是一夢！』</p>
<p>但憂鬱和不滿又像劍般刺入心了。現實是一條殘酷的鞭，不容人有一剎忘情的快樂，光陰盡速地流着，一天過了，有明天。受够了憂鬱的苦難，希望也積疊得愈大了。</p>
<p>一切化爲陳跡，隨了光陰的飛逝，憂鬱，拋堆在後面，而更大的希望，却藏在未來的歲月中。</p>
<h3 id="c98">刦後海鹽 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 一筠</p>
<p>故鄉浙江海鹽，位據錢江要衝，無層巒疊嶂，鮮洪流汪洋，地處平原，交通捷便，商業茂榮。國父實業計劃中擬闢爲東方大港，儼然是一國防要隘。</p>
<p>七七事變，日軍以海鹽和金山衛為登陸據點：集中砲火，日夜熾烈猛攻，國軍不支，且戰且郤，遂於十月中旬淪陷。</p>
<p>日軍初佔海鹽，屠擄，縱火，自毋待言。捕聚少壯，取鐵絲串手掌中，或縛在樹上，以機槍或刺刀戮戮。如幸而復甦，則投入沼澤，無一倖免。其野蠻行為，慘盡人寰，令人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>城內屋宇，全部被焚，成爲一片瓦礫，但覺一片凄凉。舊日的民衆敎育館，圖書館，和體育塲內各項設備，都被訴毀，敎育事業　摧毀殆盡。</p>
<p>城垣被砲火打坍。天寗塔。亦被砲彈洞穿，滿身瘡痍，危危欲墜　戰前電力公司內的發電機，街頭的電綫，電桿木都被日寇擬走一空。</p>
<p>現在市面蕭條，入夜更覺凄寂。追溯往昔的繁榮，不禁令人黯然。</p>

<p>熱水每杓十元，喝杯開水，也不容易。老百姓如處水深火熱中。</p>
<p>老虎灶的重要，僅次於目來水，這樣未得當局的核准而自由漲價，簡直是胡鬧。</p>
<p>老虎灶向來不如普通商店的自由營業而有地段之規定，普通商店尙要限價，而此有特殊規定的老虎灶這樣胡鬧，實在有緊急製裁的必要。</p>
<p>怎樣制裁呢？惟有將老虎灶劃歸公用局管理，以便一舉一動都受市政當局的嚴格管理，不致再像普通商店之由同業公會操縱了。</p>

<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>第二次大戰以前，不消說，巴黎是世界藝術之都，可是自從一九四〇年納粹把它淪陷以後，世界藝術之都的地位便自然而然的消失了。</p>
<p>今日世界藝術之都究竟應該建立在那裘，這固然要看傳統的文化與政治的經濟的諸條件而確定的。</p>
<p>可是，我們也得注意，今日的藝術，是一定伴着民主精神的高揚而發展，換句話說：今日的藝術是爲着人類的文化，自由，幸福而努力的，它將不是感傷與頹廢的藝術，或畸形與病態的表現了。</p>
<p>從這樣的說法來看，世界藝術之都的奠基，便在全世界最能表現民主精神的國家之內，這是不容疑慮的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After Victory, Inspecting Beiping for Half a Month: Chairman and Wife Fly Back to the Capital, Will Continue Talks with Marshall <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, departed Nanjing by special plane at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, flying to Chongqing. Military Advisor General Shang, Bureau Chief Yu, and Secretary-General Xiangjian followed along. Previously, the Chairman had instructed that this not be made known externally, to spare the millions of citizens the trouble of seeing them off and to save on security measures. Leaders from all circles of the party, government, and military in Nanjing, understanding the Chairman's intentions, only had Mayor Ma go to the airport to represent them in seeing him off.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, Military Advisor General Shang Zhen, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Bureau Chief Yu Jishi, and others, returned to Chongqing this morning at 10:35 AM on two separate airplanes. The Chairman's plane circled above Wuhan for a week, inspecting the area, before safely landing at Jiulongpo Airport at 2:40 PM. The Chairman and his wife then took a military vehicle to their official residence to rest. Following the victory of the War of Resistance, this was the Chairman's first inspection of the old capital and the capital city, staying in Beiping for eight days from the 11th and in Nanjing for six days from the 18th. Wherever the Chairman went, he received a warm welcome from the people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall, after arriving in Chongqing yesterday, was accompanied by Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen to his residence in Jialing Village. He then dined with U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robertson and several others. Mr. Marshall went to bed immediately after the meal last night due to fatigue from the journey. Besides some foreign reporters, there were no other guests visiting. Mr. Schupple, a member of Marshall's staff, said that Mr. Marshall was not yet aware of the sad news of the death of Lieutenant General Patton, former commander of the U.S. Third Army, in Europe. Mr. Marshall is residing in a residence belonging to a certain national bank, which is perfectly equipped with heating and cooling, steel-framed windows, and tiled floors, making it a rare find in Chongqing. Former U.S. Representative Willkie, former U.S. Vice President Wallace, and other American dignitaries have visited Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The residence of U.S. Special Envoy Marshall is not yet fully arranged, but it is known that he will be invited to attend the Christmas Eve dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife. According to Schupple, the special envoy intends to decline all social engagements within possible limits and devote himself to his important mission. Accompanying Mr. Marshall are Colonel Searle, Military Attaché, and attendants Hick, Saul, and Juen. How long Mr. Marshall will stay in China is currently unpredictable, and may depend on the development of the political and military situation in China. If China can achieve peace and unification as soon as possible, then Mr. Marshall's stay in China may be shortened.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Chongqing this afternoon. The Chairman is expected to meet with U.S. Special Envoy Marshall tonight or tomorrow morning for their first conversation. According to a statement from Marshall's adjutant, Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and Dong Biwu paid a visit to Special Envoy Marshall today to pay their respects and exchange friendly opinions. The conversation lasted one hour, with the special envoy mostly listening and talking little. This is the first time that representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have presented their views to the American ambassador.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] British Prime Minister's Representative to China, General Wyatt, visited Special Envoy Marshall at 11:30 AM on the 23rd. According to Special Envoy's Secretary Schupple, Marshal Marshall will host reporters on the morning of the 24th, so he does not intend to issue any statements today.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Before Leaving Nanjing, Summoning Responsible Individuals to Instruct on Municipal Improvements, Inspecting Various Parts of the City Lightly and Simply <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, has already departed Nanjing this morning to return to Chongqing. Although the Chairman's stay in Nanjing was only five days, the spiritual warmth he gave to the compatriots in the capital and southeastern regions was like the result of his inspection of Beiping, which cannot be estimated by numbers alone. This can be seen in the daily conversations of people in Nanjing and the joyful and encouraging remarks in Shanghai newspapers. During his five-day stay in Nanjing, the Chairman paid respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, met with Special Envoy Marshall, and gave instructions to the military and political leaders from various regions who came to Nanjing to pay their respects. He also took time to inspect the city several times. On the 20th, he inspected various places in the mausoleum area simply and lightly. On the 21st, he went to Wutaishan to visit the (Shinto Shrine) built by the Japanese army and summoned Mayor Ma Chaojun there to instruct on municipal construction. On the 22nd, he visited Linggu Temple again and gave alms to the monks. Then, he went outside Guanghua Gate, where, in addition to inspecting the airfield, he seemed to have commemorated the battles of the defense of Nanjing. On the evening before his departure, he summoned the responsible personnel of the party, government, and military in the capital to have dinner together. During the dinner, he earnestly instructed that Nanjing, as the capital of China, which attracts worldwide attention, must focus on tidying up the city and cultivating a new spirit, which is an essential task in the reconstruction. He then listed various points, giving detailed instructions. It is said that he also issued several handwritten orders to Mayor Ma, specifically pointing out: (1) Zhongshan Road must be completely repaired; (2) the gate towers of Zhongshan Gate and Yijiang Gate must be rebuilt; (3) the water supply and drainage system must be improved; (4) the slogans in the city should be improved. After receiving the order, the municipal authorities are currently planning to implement it. In addition, the five petition boxes set up by the Chairman's office in Nanjing have received a large number of letters from the public in the past three days, and the moving stories among them are no less than those in Beiping. Before the Chairman's departure, he also sent Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen to stay in Nanjing to handle the closing matters. The eagerness of the Chairman in seeking the people's well-being has inspired the elders of Nanjing. Also, the gentle and approachable attitude of the Chairman's wife during her five-day stay in Nanjing has left the deepest impression on the tens of thousands of men, women, old and young in Nanjing. On the 20th, the wife quietly traveled incognito and had a small meal at the Dahua Chun Restaurant in Confucius Temple. Within a few minutes, the crowd outside the door gathered and was impassable, all vying to see the wife. After finishing the meal and leaving the door, she comforted the elderly and young, frequently greeting them, lasting for more than ten minutes before waving her scarf and getting into the car amidst cheers.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Amid the acceptance of the Northeast, being thrown into the cracks between the internal affairs and diplomacy of the Northeast and China, seems to have been forgotten. Two months ago, General Liu Duoquan, who originally wanted to go to the Northeast from Dongchun to take over, had already flown back to Beiping for the winter. The members of the Rehe Provincial Government Committee are also here sightseeing, but they all hope that after the Northeast issue is resolved, they will be able to enter Chengde as soon as possible. Chairman Liu also plans to go to Chengde in mid-next month to deploy everything. Rehe originally belonged to the Twelfth War Zone. Due to the current situation, Sun Lanfeng, the commander of the advance troops of the Twelfth War Zone who was originally preparing to enter Rehe, has flown back to Gui Sui. In the future, military affairs will be shared by the Beiping Pacification Headquarters and the Northeast Pacification Headquarters, but financial, transportation, and administrative aspects will be consistent with the provinces of the Northeast. General Du Yuming, who is actually responsible for the military affairs of Rehe, recently told reporters that after the acceptance of the Northeast, we will have a solution for Rehe. The Soviet and Mongolian troops within Rehe have withdrawn last month. Currently, most of the garrison troops are local Communist forces. The acceptance of Rehe is no longer a diplomatic issue.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] Today, there are two major events here. One is the opening of the Bank of China, and the other is the acceptance of the municipal administration. These two historically significant events have brought a strong sense of spring to the snow-covered Changchun. Although some citizens did not foresee that Changchun would suddenly change its era overnight, the vehicles and horses in front of the two huge buildings in Daguan Square, and the flags of the Party and the country, gave them a clear indication. The Bank of China opened at 9:00 AM. Three hours later, the new mayor arrived. The crowds of well-wishers, including the military delegation of the Northeast Pacification Headquarters, the Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, the Air Force Headquarters, military and political personnel, directors and supervisors of the Changchun Railway, local gentry, and the Soviet Commercial Director, the manager of the Soviet Far East Bank, and Marshal Ma's economic advisor, the deputy commander of the city defense, etc., all proceeded to the city government after having tea and refreshments at the Bank of China. No ceremony was held for the opening of the Bank of China or the acceptance of the municipal administration. The guests and hosts met, and laughter arose, revealing heartfelt joy. Citizens in the streets talked about our government and our bank. Their accumulated depression of the past fourteen years is now rapidly disappearing, replaced by infinite warmth and anticipation. The "Changchun" in history has now begun its supreme true meaning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] The branch of the Central Bank officially opened at 9:00 AM this morning. Chairman Zhang of the Economic Commission sent a special envoy to offer tea and refreshments to the guests at the bank. Mr. Zhang also spoke to the press, explaining the mission of the Central Bank and the significance of issuing banknotes for circulation in nine provinces. These banknotes have now begun to circulate. What was seen today was the 50-yuan note. The other four types will be released after they are delivered. The 50-yuan note has a purple pattern and a photo of the Customs on the front. Guests rushed to exchange them and asked Chairman Zhang and Central Bank staff to sign them as souvenirs. A few minutes after the bank opened, a large number of deposits flowed in. The first account was the Bank of China's one million yuan. Mr. Wei Xijiu is temporarily acting as the manager of the Central Bank, and Wang Yujing and Hu Zhaoying are also acting as deputy managers. The daily business hours are temporarily set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After taking office, Mayor Zhao revealed three basic policy guidelines, all of which were indicated by Chairman Chiang: (1) Establish a good political foundation. (2) Strengthen economic construction. (3) Improve the people's cultural standards. Mr. Zhao also emphasized the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, saying: In the future, we will strive to promote good relations between the two countries. Mr. Zhao studied in Japan and the United States for a total of eleven years. After returning to China, he served in the military and political circles for seventeen years, serving as a member of the Second National Political Council, Mayor of Hengyang, and commander of the garrison. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Zhao served as the head of the tax regiment and led his troops to bravely resist the Japanese in the Shanghai area, repeatedly making meritorious contributions.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The National Army's air transportation to the Northeast will begin within the week. Fifth Division Commander Li Zefen has returned to Beiping from Changchun today to prepare to discuss the air transportation of the division to Changchun. It is reported that the scale of this air transportation of the National Army to the Northeast will be extremely large, and the completion time will be very fast. Therefore, the preparation period is also longer, causing people to feel impatient.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] San Francisco Radio broadcasted on the 23rd that the Du Yuming troops who landed at Huludao yesterday were directly transported by the U.S. Seventh Fleet transport ships from Haiphong.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] The National Army's recovery of the nine northeastern provinces is becoming more and more clear. The liaison group is advancing towards four targets, and other troops have been airlifted to Changchun this week, and the deployment has been completed. According to news from Jinzhou, the railway section from Goubangzi to Xinmin had been destroyed by the Communist army but has now been repaired. The National Army has advanced along the line to Qingduizi, waiting to meet with the Soviet military liaison officer. The two sides will hold a meeting in Xinmin to discuss the detailed arrangements for accepting the Northeast. The second liaison group is advancing towards Fuxin in the north, the third liaison group is advancing towards the central part of Rehe Province, and its ultimate goal is Chifeng in the northern part of the province; the fourth group is advancing from the southwest and will contact the Soviet army in Panshan. The movement of the Soviet liaison group indicates that the Chinese and Soviet representatives in Changchun have made decisive progress. Other factors, such as the landing of the headquarters troops at Huludao, carrying 465 trucks and cars to enhance their strength, are also encouraging. The National Army advanced ninety miles from Huludao to contact General Du Yuming at the Jinzhou Headquarters. The air transportation of the 94th Army to Changchun can begin this week and can be completed in a short period of time.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] In the future, the country's postal service will still focus on promoting village post boxes, supplementing the postal network, and strengthening the delivery of various types of mail. In terms of telecommunications, it has been decided not to divide the country into nine telecommunications zones according to political regions. Each zone will have a management bureau. It is planned to make Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces the first zone, with the zone management bureau in Nanjing. Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi will be the second zone, with the zone management bureau in Hankou. Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi will be the third zone, with the zone management bureau in Guangzhou. Guizhou and Yunnan provinces will be the fourth zone, with the zone management bureau in Kunming. Sichuan, Kang, and Tibet will be the fifth zone, with the zone management bureau in Chongqing. Henan and Shaanxi will be the sixth zone, with the zone management bureau in Xi'an. Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang will be the seventh zone, with the zone management also in Lanzhou. Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi will be the eighth zone, with the zone management bureau in Beiping. The nine northeastern provinces will be the ninth zone, with the zone management bureau in Weichun. The three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan may become a separate zone depending on future business conditions, but for the time being, they will be concurrently managed by Beiping.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The full list of 120 Japanese war criminals to be arrested in Beiping has been handed over to the Japanese Liaison Department for Execution of Post-War Matters for execution. Twenty people have now been captured and detained in the garrison headquarters. The rest are still being arrested, and some have fled. Most of the arrested war criminals are liaison officers, police officers, and military police. Among them, the more high-ranking ones are Honma Seiu, head of the Tianjin Army Liaison Department, and  Yūhei, head of the Army Liaison Department. Although their positions were high, they committed many crimes against the people on a daily basis. Now, they are in the detention center, and their meals are no different from those of our soldiers. They can also communicate with the outside world, which can be said to be quite comfortable and free. However, some war criminals complained about the lack of heating as soon as they entered the detention center. They seem to have forgotten the cruel torture they used to inflict on the Chinese people not long ago, such as pouring cold water into their noses.</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Relief Administration Announces - Relief Plan for China <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Lehman, Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, announced today: The cost of the relief plan for China, including Korea, totals $675 million. This is the largest amount since the establishment of the Administration. China has been ravaged by war for fourteen years, and its need for relief is shocking. In the relief work in China, careful consideration will be given to making the best use of all available resources to help the Chinese government and its people as much as possible. Lehman said: "The Dunren Envoy Mission has been in China for more than a year, and now we are accelerating the implementation of the plan. The large amount of supplies delivered to the coastal ports will be transported inland as soon as the transportation is restored." He continued: "Korea will become one of the fifteen administrative districts of the relief plan for China." The full announcement of the financial distribution of the relief effort needs to be made for the first time. Mr. Lehman said: "The funds may be changed due to changes in the situation. The total cost is $377,660,000, of which $35.1 million is for administrative expenses, $55.5 million is for branch expenses, $19.1 million is for use in dealing with unemployed people, and the remainder will be distributed to the following countries for relief, in addition to China: Albania $30 million, the Soviet Union $60 million, Czechoslovakia $31.5 million, Greece $45 million, Italy $49 million, Yugoslavia $51.9 million, Dodecanese Islands, Abyssinia, etc. $37.8 million, and $18.5 million is reserved for emergency relief projects." Lehman declared: "Because the funds donated by the United States have been allocated, the relief work in Europe and Asia can be greatly accelerated. The Relief Administration has saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and will continue to rescue a large number of refugees, but if we want to provide universal relief without any omissions, the funds, food, medicine, clothing, etc. are still insufficient. It is said that at the previous meeting in London, it was necessary to complete the relief work by the end of 1946, and in the Pacific region by the spring of 1947." He concluded: "Of the thirty-one countries in the Relief Administration, all have donated except for Guatemala and Liberia."</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Vice Admiral Barbey, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet Amphibious Forces, stayed in Nanjing for one day and twice called on Chairman Chiang to discuss important matters. He left Nanjing for Shanghai this morning. He smiled and said to the reporters, "I had a good night's sleep at Premier Song Ziwen's private residence. The comfort of the bed made me reluctant to leave. Special Envoy Marshall also stayed here yesterday, so why can't I stay here?"</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] (Delayed) Rear Admiral Barbey revealed today that during his meeting with Chairman Chiang here, it was agreed to transfer six Liberty ships and an unspecified number of tank landing craft to the Chinese government, which will then be operated by Chinese crews, mainly for sending Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their country. These ships are currently unloading their last consignment of troops to North China and the Northeast. As soon as the work is completed, the Liberty ships will return to Shanghai for transfer to Chinese crews. Chinese crew members who will operate the tank landing craft are currently training in Qingdao, where 60 U.S. sailors are teaching 600 Chinese crew members. The future plan is to train Chinese crew members to operate all types of amphibious vehicles, because these vehicles are surplus in the United States and are suitable for use on the Chinese coast and inland rivers. Since Liberty ships belong to merchant ships, their transfer to China does not require congressional approval. The gun positions and other wartime equipment on Liberty ships and tank landing craft will be dismantled. Mr. Barbey said: During his meeting with Chairman Sun this afternoon, he discussed general issues related to Chinese shipping, but said that he could not discuss other assistance transportation requirements other than Liberty ships and tank landing craft. The crew training plan was proposed by Chairman Chiang.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] Regarding the situation and content of the discussions at the Political Consultative Conference, all parties advocate for openness and allowing newspaper reporters to attend and report the news to satisfy the concerns of all parties. The newspapers are currently negotiating with the relevant authorities on this matter, but it is heard that the authorities in charge are still considering this approach.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: It is heard that the relationship between the Communist Party representatives in Chongqing and the Kuomintang is very harmonious. Last night, the U.S. Information Service held a dance party in Chongqing, which Zhou Enlai and Wu Guozhen attended. A certain American female reporter praised Mr. Zhou Enlai's dancing skills. [United Press, Yan'an, 23rd] Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army, Zhu De, stated: The Communist armies in the areas of Baotou, Gui Sui, and Datong have been ordered to withdraw as an expression of the Communist Party's hope for peace. As for other plans of the Communist Party, they can be described as follows: (1) The delegation of the Communist Party to the Political Consultative Conference is fully authorized to immediately discuss with the U.S. Special Envoy, Marshall, the matters of ceasing the civil war and establishing a coalition government. (2) The Communist Party suggests an immediate and unconditional ceasefire for two weeks. (3) Once peace is restored and a coalition government is established, the Communist Party is prepared to disband all units except for the twenty divisions that have been agreed upon to be retained. (4) The newly established coalition government welcomes the 2 billion U.S. dollars in loans from the United States to develop domestic industry, provided that it does not hinder the independent development of China's economy. Zhu De also stated that since U.S. President Truman has announced his support for an early end to the civil war in China, he is very optimistic about the Political Consultative Conference. When asked how the Communist army would be reorganized, he replied that once the coalition government is established, the Communist army can be reasonably and fairly incorporated into the National Army, but it is inappropriate to ask the Communist army to lay down its arms at present, as this would be a surrender, not a solution.</p>

It must not only liberate toward the Japanese-occupied areas, but also toward the areas ruled by the Kuomintang government. After Japan surrendered, the new enemy is the ruling class of the Kuomintang.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Three-Power Talks Last Seven Hours, Demonstrating a New Spirit of Cooperation, Acknowledging the Possibility of Early Conclusion of the Meeting <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 23rd, after seven hours of talks between the foreign ministers of the three powers yesterday, they continued the talks for two hours this afternoon.

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] Well-informed sources announced today that the Three Foreign Ministers Conference has made considerable achievements, and the restoration of the spirit of wartime cooperation is one of them. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes considers this to be a major achievement, but British Foreign Secretary Bevin is not as optimistic about the final outcome.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 23rd] The Three-Power Conference continues to bring good news. The optimism in Moscow diplomatic circles has not been greater than this since the end of the war. Although the content of the talks remains tightly guarded, yesterday's meeting was held in Molotov's office in the Kremlin. An observer said yesterday that after the abolition of formalities, the meeting progressed unusually rapidly. The U.S. side also revealed yesterday that the meeting may end at Christmas. The British representative was unable to make such a prediction but also acknowledged that the end would be earlier than expected. The foreign ministers do not necessarily have to step up their work to quickly reach an agreement. The official announcement of the purpose of this meeting is "exploratory," to eliminate misunderstandings and to broadly study various international issues. Although there have been optimistic reports about the Moscow conference from time to time, Washington said yesterday that the Soviet Union's attitude toward Turkey and Iran is difficult to deal with, but related parties should still strive to mediate to avoid serious adverse effects on the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>

Second, the trusteeship period will be jointly participated in by the U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. Political figures here said that this is only the solution proposed by the U.S., and the U.S. government may also be prepared to discuss other proposals.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Christmas Odds and Ends <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] President Truman delivered a short speech while lighting the Christmas tree, briefly stating: "This year's Christmas is a holiday that the whole world has looked forward to for many terrible years. Peace brings joy. As we light the Christmas tree again now, the gloomy years of war have passed... We should remember the spirit of Christmas, which is the spirit of peace, and the spirit of love for all mankind. ... Our enemies have now been overcome, and we should step up our efforts for our future work. We cannot fail, nor can we change our purpose. No country can ever again wage war against other countries."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] Americans are preparing to celebrate their first peaceful Christmas in five years, spending money like water to buy gifts, and sales are unprecedentedly strong. Most stores have sold out of goods. According to retailers, customers are willing to pay high prices for gifts whenever they come to the door. Whiskey, which is usually bought at the last minute, is also very difficult to find. Scotch and bourbon are almost sold out. Inferior whiskey has risen from $3.50 to $4.50 per bottle, which is almost double the pre-war price. French brandy has risen from $7 to $9 per bottle, and some have risen from $15 to $20. Women's underwear is one of the main Christmas gifts, and the price has risen from $3 to $7. Shirts were not easy to get during the war, and the price has risen from $1.50 to $2.50. Although children's toys are well-stocked, they are very expensive and mostly made of wood, but buyers are still very enthusiastic. The money saved from military work savings and veterans' pensions can be used to spend as much as possible. However, the prices of books, gramophone records, and cosmetics remain unchanged. It can be seen that Americans' spending is not entirely without purpose.</p>
<p>[United Press, Uraga, 23rd] Christmas is just around the corner, and Americans may have a sense of being far away from the war, but here on the pier, starving Japanese soldiers can still be seen fainting on the ground.

A ship carrying 1,100 Japanese people who studied in the United States and were sent back home because they did not want to be Americans were as thin as firewood, and some could not stand and fell to the ground. Nurses injected medicine and then used stretchers to carry them onto trucks.</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Question of the Japanese Emperor's Remaining in Office, Abdicating or Not, Depends on the Japanese People, MacArthur Does Not Intend to Add War Crime Charges <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Special Dispatch] According to authoritative sources speaking to the Central News Agency, unless new evidence is obtained proving the emperor guilty, or MacArthur receives instructions from the highest authority based on Allied public opinion, MacArthur does not intend to add the name of war criminal to Japanese Emperor Hirohito or force him to abdicate. Rumors are rife here that the emperor will be listed as a war criminal, and some unconfirmed reports believe that the emperor's abdication is to avoid the imperial system being tainted by war crimes. Former Minister of the Imperial Household, Matsumoto Kanchiro, who is now one of the emperor's advisors, told the Central News Agency reporter a few days ago after meeting with Minister of the Imperial Household, Ishiwatari Shotaro, that he was unaware of any discussions between MacArthur's headquarters and the Japanese Imperial Household regarding war crimes and abdication. Furthermore, MacArthur has never had any opinions on Emperor Hirohito and the imperial system. Prince Takamatsu, the emperor's younger brother, also made similar statements yesterday. It is generally believed that if the emperor abdicates, Prince Mikasa will most likely become regent, because Prince Mikasa is currently suffering from lung disease, and because Prince Mikasa had some dealings with the Japanese warlords after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and disagreed with Hirohito. It is reported that during Emperor Hirohito's historic audience with MacArthur, he told MacArthur that the emperor's power could not be implemented and requested the personal privilege to represent the will of the Japanese people in 1941. It is reported that the emperor told MacArthur at the time that under the support of the warlords, there was no other way but to launch a war. This secret meeting is generally considered satisfactory. Among the various instructions imposed by MacArthur on the Japanese government is the elimination of the separation between the emperor and his subjects, even if he does not remain a puppet of the government for many years. Currently, the power of the warlords and other powers have been eliminated, the cunning Konoe Fumimaro has committed suicide, and Kido Koichi is also in prison. Hirohito can exercise his imperial power. MacArthur's recent abolition of the government's instructions related to the Shinto religion can also be interpreted as preventing the emperor from being obstructed by Shintoism and can focus on being a righteous person. Senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters hinted that if the emperor can have the foresight to solve the rice shortage and unemployment problems and follow the democratic system that MacArthur has imposed on Japan, so that the Japanese people can obtain a reasonable and perfect government, then the emperor and his system can be permanently maintained. At the same time, they warned that if the emperor is still confused at this time of crisis and cannot exercise his imperial power, a revolution will occur, forcing him to abdicate, and the imperial system will be eradicated. The emperor has decided to meet with Japanese reporters starting in the next ten days. This is the beginning of the emperor's desire to understand public opinion. For decades, due to the planned actions of warlords and conspirators, he has been unable to meet with the people, and separation has arisen. However, the cabinet is weak and incompetent, and the parliament is following suit, and the emperor cannot benefit his subjects. It is believed that if it is now stipulated that politicians who are unqualified and difficult to agree with cannot participate in the future general election, the current situation can be remedied in case of emergency, but the formation of a new cabinet is also a major problem at present. Recently, it has been rumored here that the Japanese Imperial Household has prepared to request MacArthur's approval for the emperor's abdication, and MacArthur hopes to continue to occupy Japan, abide by the surrender terms, and implement them. The emperor himself hopes to leave the matter of abdication to the Japanese people to decide.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Special Dispatch] The Japanese small newspaper Minpō commented on the emperor's meeting with Japanese reporters, saying: Ultimately, the emperor's audience is not a real meeting. In this democratic century, if the emperor's contact with the people is appropriate, then why can't the people have a real meeting with the emperor?</p>

<p>Hundreds of Japanese Ships Were Sunk</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: The U.S. Navy Department recently revealed for the first time that in the final stages of the war against Japan, the United States used secret weapons. This weapon is a radar-controlled missile. Hundreds of Japanese ships were sunk in the Pacific, making it the only successful automatic bomb in the war. This type of missile is twelve feet long, can carry heavy explosives, and has the same speed as ordinary aircraft. It is launched from naval aircraft and controlled by radar. It can fly directly to its destination. When it arrives, the Japanese are always caught off guard and call it a bat. On one occasion, two U.S. aircraft used radar to discover two Japanese ships anchored twenty miles away. They then approached to determine whether they were Japanese ships. The Japanese responded with anti-aircraft fire. The U.S. aircraft moved away from the range of the anti-aircraft fire and then launched missiles, immediately hitting one of them. The other ship continued to fire anti-aircraft fire, believing that a real aircraft had arrived.</p>

<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] Admiral Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet, announced at a press conference that 18,000 British Royal Army troops, including a brigade of Australian troops, a brigade of Indian troops, and a New Zealand fighter squadron, will land in Wu Port to participate in the occupation of the Japanese mainland, as the area has been designated as a port within the British occupation zone. The admiral also stated that while Singapore is equally important as a base, the coastal headquarters of the Pacific Fleet will be located in Hong Kong. Major repair work will continue to be carried out in Australia. He pointed out that the reason for locating the naval headquarters in Hong Kong is to facilitate contact with the American fleet, to be closer to Japan, and because the climate is better than Singapore. The admiral further stated that Britain is prepared to hand over the cruiser "Aurora" and one gunboat to China, but the date of the transfer will depend on when the Chinese naval personnel are ready. The British Pacific Fleet currently has seven cruisers and sixteen destroyers.</p>

<p>[United Press, The Hague, 22nd] The Dutch government issued a declaration today stating that the Dutch authorities will do their utmost to resolve the Dutch East Indies dispute in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The purpose of this declaration is to respond to the memorandum submitted by the U.S. State Department on Thursday, in which it stated that the U.S. government is increasingly concerned about the situation in the Dutch East Indies and hopes that all parties can renew their efforts to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 23rd] Well-informed sources here predict that there will be significant developments in the Dutch East Indies situation after Deputy Governor-General Van Mook returns from reporting to his home country.

<h3 id="e44">General Lo Cho-ying Visits Hong Kong; A Prelude to Sino-British Friendship and Cooperation Between Hong Kong and Guangdong <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Liang Feng</p>
<p>Guangdong and Hong Kong are closely linked, like lips and teeth. There is a need for mutual benefit and assistance in matters such as transportation, economics, and overseas Chinese affairs. Chairman Lo Cho-ying of the Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to promote Sino-British relations and the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and to observe how the British authorities in Hong Kong are revitalizing Hong Kong and Kowloon, so as to draw lessons from them; at the same time, because many overseas Chinese who failed to escape after Hong Kong fell into enemy hands struggled and remained loyal under the oppression of the enemy's iron heel, which is a matter of great concern to Chairman Lo, at 6:30 AM on the 10th of December, Chairman Lo, accompanied by Provincial Government Committee members Huang Wenshan and Xiao Ciwo, and more than a dozen staff members, traveled by express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Hong Kong for an unofficial visit to the Hong Kong authorities and to comfort the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon.</p>
<p>Chairman Lo is a well-rounded and famous general who has fought hundreds of battles. This was his first time leading an expeditionary force abroad, achieving extraordinary success. His glorious achievements are already deeply admired by the overseas Chinese. Moreover, after the victory of the war, they can openly welcome the leaders of our country there, just as they would see a long-lost family head, which makes them feel honored, joyful, and excited.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Offer Flowers</p>
<p>The train arrived at 3:00 PM. Hong Kong Governor Rear Admiral Harcourt, British Army Commander Major General Fitzwilliam, and our welcoming guests: Chen Su, Director of the Kuomintang General Branch in Hong Kong and Macau, Wu Hougong, representative of the Central Propaganda Department, Zhong Yunan, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Special Commissioner for Guangdong and Guangxi, Wang Yifu, representative of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the Youth Corps and male and female members of the Youth Corps, Zhong E, Special Commissioner for the Fujian and Guangdong Region of the Ministry of Finance, and overseas Chinese leaders Dong Zhongwei and Guo Zan, as well as representatives from various community organizations, more than a thousand people in all, were already standing on the platform with smiles to welcome them. After Chairman Lo and others got off the train, they shook hands with the Governor, Major General Fitzwilliam, and all the representatives, exchanging greetings. The Governor and Major General Fitzwilliam had smiles on their faces, appearing very happy, unlike the usual reserved British military personnel.</p>
<p>After Chairman Lo reviewed the British Royal Guard of Honor, he and the Governor proceeded to review the Youth Corps members waiting to welcome them and accepted flowers from the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon. These young people were physically strong and full of energy. Chairman Lo nodded frequently, seemingly deeply commending these masters of the new China to be built in the future.</p>
<p>Time was running late, so Chairman Lo and the Governor boarded a specially prepared motorboat to cross the sea. At 6:00 PM, the Governor hosted a cocktail reception, and Chairman Lo was hosted by the Governor that night and stayed at the Government House.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Grand Gathering</p>
<p>The Chairman left the Governor's residence and, accompanied by his staff, inspected the Kuomintang General Branch in Hong Kong and Macau and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the Youth Corps, and visited the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Then he went to the military representative group to meet with Generals Mo Xingshuo, Pan Huaguo, and Zhou Yanbin, and together they visited the Eastern Pung Kok Yuen to see the free school organized by the Hong Kong Buddhist Association. Chairman Lo inquired about and comforted the innocent and lively pupils with great care, which moved these children to tears.</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM, all circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a grand welcome meeting at the Entertainment Theatre, with over a thousand participants. This was truly an unprecedented grand gathering in the hundred years since Hong Kong was opened as a port. The atmosphere was extremely warm and tense, fully expressing the overseas Chinese's love and respect for Chairman Lo. Chairman Lo was in full military uniform that day, his chest adorned with shining medals. He was tall and imposing. When he walked into the venue as music played, the overseas Chinese were overjoyed to see him. After Chairman Chen Su delivered the opening speech and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Dong Zhongwei delivered the welcome speech, Chairman Lo gave instructions, and the entire atmosphere became even more solemn and tense. Chairman Lo first conveyed his greetings to the overseas Chinese and then encouraged them to "cooperate and unite to make Guangdong more prosperous and build a new China and a new Guangdong based on the Three Principles of the People..." Chairman Lo's earnest instructions gave the overseas Chinese infinite warmth and comfort.</p>
<p>Visiting British Warships</p>
<p>After the meeting, Chairman Lo, at the invitation of the British naval authorities, visited their naval cruiser "Bermuda", aircraft carrier "Venerable", and submarine "Tacidon". Chairman Lo's actions during the expedition to Burma were well known throughout the world. Therefore, the British naval officers and soldiers on the ships were very excited to have the opportunity to see this intelligent and capable Chinese general, and they all felt honored. Their diligent hospitality and grand welcome also deeply thanked Chairman Lo! At noon, Chairman Lo was hosted by Major General Fitzwilliam for lunch at the British Army Commander's residence.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, Chairman Lo also went to the welcome meeting of the Chongzheng General Association, an organization of overseas Chinese from Hakka descent, where he was presented with a brocade embroidered with the words "Thousands of Cities for the Party and Nation." Then he attended the welcome meeting of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>As night fell and the lights began to shine, Chairman Lo went to the Jianguo Restaurant to attend the Hong Kong and Kowloon community's banquet, which can be regarded as the most recordable page of Chairman Lo's visit to Hong Kong, and it can also be said that the rhythm of this itinerary reached its climax. The overseas Chinese regarded Chairman Lo as sacred, and they were as respectful and respectful to him as they were to a family head, as if Chairman Lo had brought them spring. Every overseas Chinese face was filled with proud smiles. After three rounds of drinks, overseas Chinese leader Dong Zhongwei gave a speech, praising Chairman Lo to the extreme. He said: "Chairman Lo is both literary and martial, intelligent and brave, and has repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats in the Battle of Burma. His prestige is well-known. Now he has come to preside over the government of Guangdong, governing the people with the good methods of managing the army, and managing politics with the extraordinary strategies of warfare. Although military and civilian affairs are different, the principles of governing are the same. As Ouyang Wen-Zhong Gong said, 'Going out as a general and entering as a prime minister, working diligently for the royal family, being steadfast in times of danger, and placing the country in a state of stability,' Chairman Lo is truly worthy of this honor..."</p>
<p>Concern for Overseas Chinese Affairs</p>
<p>Chairman Lo stood up in thunderous applause and gave a sincere speech. In addition to repeatedly thanking the overseas Chinese for their deep affection, he also elaborated on his policy guidelines for Guangdong, saying: "Developing overseas Chinese affairs and strengthening the power of overseas Chinese, making them a vital force in our construction, is one of the five major guidelines for building a new Guangdong based on the Three Principles of the People." He also said: "Hong Kong is the general station for developing Nanyang commerce. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong extending their commerce to Nanyang is certainly not aggression, but only natural development, because the overseas Chinese in Nanyang are our brothers... Overseas Chinese lay a great economic foundation in a peaceful manner, based on natural development, which is a great contribution to the motherland... Regarding protecting the people's businesses, not only does Guangdong Province's policy direction have such a decision, but Chairman Chiang has already declared on economic policy that he encourages the people to operate and develop the people's livelihood economy, implementing wealth for the people. Overseas Chinese occupy a superior position in the development of commerce, especially the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Guangdong Provincial Government, adhering to the central government's policies, grants the convenience of free operation to the people in all industrial and commercial businesses except those that are publicly operated, and at the same time decides to provide guarantees. I hope that the overseas Chinese leaders in Hong Kong and Kowloon will make various industrial and commercial developments for the welfare of the people and the country, cooperate with the national policies, and strive for the work of strengthening the country." Afterwards, Chairman Lo introduced the two committee members, Huang Wenshan and Xiao Ciwo, to the overseas Chinese leaders, because Committee Member Huang plans to stay in Hong Kong for a while to listen to the opinions of the overseas Chinese leaders on cultural and educational undertakings. Committee Member Xiao's task in staying in Hong Kong is to investigate transportation and food issues. Finally, Chairman Lo led everyone to raise their glasses and remotely wish Chairman Chiang good health. The grand gathering ended in a pleasant and festive atmosphere. When Chairman Lo boarded his car in front of the Jianguo Restaurant, the crowd had already gathered around, as they rarely had the opportunity to see Chairman Lo's elegant demeanor.</p>
<p>Farewell in Hong Kong</p>
<p>This highest administrator of Guangdong Province, due to his heavy official duties, could not delay any longer. On the morning of the 12th, Chairman Lo bid farewell to the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon! The Tsim Sha Tsui station was as crowded as the day before. Governor Harcourt also went to the station with senior officials to see him off. Governor Harcourt also decided to lead senior officials of the Hong Kong government to Guangdong on the 17th of this month to return the visit. At 9:10 AM, the train whistled mercilessly. Chairman Lo and his party had no choice but to bid farewell to the people who came to see them off one by one. The overseas Chinese leaders and a group of male and female members of the Youth Corps were even more reluctant to part, as if Chairman Lo had taken their hearts away. The train slowly left the platform, but they were still standing there in a daze.</p>
<p>Although it was only a short two days, it made us deeply feel that after the victory, our international status has obviously improved, and the Allied countries have a different view of our country. At the same time, the enthusiastic emotions of the overseas Chinese over the past two days and their respect for the leaders of the motherland all the more show how eager they are for the success of the motherland's construction. Chairman Lo said it well. He said: "The harmonious atmosphere between the Chinese and British personnel in the past two days is enough to foreshadow the brilliant future of cooperation between the two sides. At the same time, in the loving atmosphere of the overseas Chinese, one can also foresee the great and bright future of China." These two sentences are a good ending to this article.

<p>The visit of the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government to Hong Kong on the 10th of this month has made a significant contribution to the future Sino-British cooperation and the development of Hong Kong overseas Chinese affairs. During his visit to the Hong Kong Governor, Chairman Lo also visited the British aircraft carrier "Venerable" for observation.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Sardines Are Not for Eating, But for Buying and Selling: An American Reporter's Observations on Shanghai <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>An American sailor, seaman, and pilot happily arrived in the recovered Shanghai eleven weeks after the victory of the war. A correspondent from the *Times* cabled a dispatch describing the major Chinese port.</p>
<p>The Sound of Money, Like Thunder</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is indeed a good place.</p>
<p>Shanghai is still a metropolis where East and West meet, engage in lofty discussions, and the sound of money clangs like thunder. Outwardly, there are few changes. You can still see the stark contrast between local houses and modern high-rise buildings. The streets are full of people. The traffic is like a surging, endless tide. There are pedestrians resigned to their fate, reckless bicycles, orderly rickshaws, and fast-moving tricycles, an incredible and surprisingly efficient combination of rickshaws and tricycles as a mode of transportation.</p>
<p>Underlying Situation in Flux</p>
<p>In terms of content, however, Shanghai is completely different. Currently, the most pressing thing is that things are almost all in flux. The most significant change is the emergence of the municipal government. The foreign powers no longer wield their authority. The British-style Municipal Council is no longer visible. The mayor is the composed, round-faced Qian Dajun, who has a long history of following Chairman Chiang. You can still see red-turbaned Indian policemen with bushy beards directing traffic, but they will soon be replaced. American military police and naval police are everywhere, but they are concentrated in areas where Americans live or visit.</p>
<p>Without Wall Street, No Major Trade</p>
<p>Shanghai is still the largest and most Westernized city in China. But it has been isolated for many years. Shanghai's frenzied transactions are all petty commodities—like retailers in New York, without the frenzy of wholesalers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>"Old Shanghai" laments to you: Compared to the prosperous days of the past, how miserable it is now! But American soldiers in this opulent city on the Pacific side are in a "carefree" place.</p>
<p>There are about seven thousand American sailors here, and about six thousand soldiers. The number of air force personnel is uncertain and cannot be accurately counted. There is beer, Scotch, vodka (Russian wine), steak, and pastries in restaurants and taverns. Its exquisite Chinese food. After getting used to military rations that only have nutritional value but no taste, tasting these things is indeed top-notch.</p>
<p>Tavern Life Thriving Day by Day</p>
<p>Taverns and nightclubs are thriving day by day. There is one called "Atomic Coffee Shop." Another is called "Jeep Nightclub." In addition, there is one that will be opening soon. There is a nightclub called Ivan Tai, which can be said to be quite elegant and refined.</p>
<p>The best place is Montland, with only forty-two seats, where drinks cost $3.50 to $4.50 USD.</p>
<p>Food is all expensive, and housing is extremely scarce. 200,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai still live in the Hongkou district, and a small number of people have to live in refugee shelters. Among all the people in Shanghai, the Jews feel the most uncertain about the future. They dream of America, just as loyal Chinese dream of paradise.</p>
<p>Lost Counterfeit Money, Lost Life</p>
<p>Money is the most awkward problem for Shanghainese. You have to carry large bags of counterfeit money, and even children and beggars have a handful of counterfeit money. Newspapers say that an elderly clerk forgot his 40 million yuan of counterfeit money on a rickshaw and died of fright. I calculated that this sum is only equivalent to 133 US dollars. This cannot help but make me feel sad.</p>
<p>The Sardine Incident, Thought-Provoking</p>
<p>Inflation is a fatal obstacle to trade. There is a strange thing in Shanghai: a box of sardines is sold and bought, passing through twenty people, so everyone profits.</p>
<p>Later, a clever man opened a can, and then opened a few more, and saw that they were all spoiled. After being deceived, he called the last seller and scolded him severely.</p>
<p>The seller shouted: "Did you open them? Good heavens! These sardines are not for eating, but for buying and selling!"</p>
<p>Silent and Unnoticed, Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Shanghai is not American Wall Street, and the authorities do not need to take strict precautions. The councilors of the municipal government are busy with hot cups and dishes, and are working hard to promote municipal affairs. Of course, Chinese people need comfort in their work.</p>
<p>There is also an interesting group of people in Shanghai, that is, the defeated Japanese, who silently want to live a Shanghai life that dares not cause trouble.</p>
<p>However, despite many troubles, Shanghainese still hold an optimistic atmosphere like gamblers, believing that one day they will get a flush and make a fortune. An American businessman nagged me for half an hour. I asked him: Does Shanghai, this metropolis, have a future after all? He leaned down, held my shoulder, and said in a low voice: "Good friend! Shanghai should exist for the prosperity of history!" (Written by John Howard of *Time* Weekly, translated by the editorial department of this newspaper)</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Problem of China's "Opposition Party" <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Li Naian</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Some say that the Chinese Kuomintang is the ruling party, and the current Communist Party is the opposition party. This statement seems to reflect that China has become democratic on the one hand, and on the other hand, it admits that all actions of the Communist Party are qualified as an opposition party. However, does China's current opposition party really possess the conditions of an opposition party in a democratic country? This is a question worth exploring.</p>
<p>Therefore, I must first declare that I am a person without any party affiliation, and I do not oppose the existence of an opposition party in China. It is not because I am a person who loves democracy and hopes that the opposition party can grow and develop its greater cause from the path of formal political struggle. The problem we are now discussing and studying is: What path should the opposition party follow, and how can it truly be called an "opposition party"?</p>
<p>The fact is very obvious. As the name suggests, the opposition party stands in opposition to the ruling party, and under the conditions that do not violate the survival interests of the country and the nation, it criticizes the current government's political programs and policies with a fair attitude, so that the country embarks on a more correct and happier path. At the same time, it can publicize its own propositions and win the support of the people to develop its strength. There are good examples of this in multi-party countries in Europe and the United States. The collapse of the Chamberlain cabinet's policy of appeasement towards Germany in Britain and the further advancement of Churchill's advocacy of war, and the United States' abandonment of neutrality and self-production of munitions in 1940, all prove the good harvest of the existence of an opposition party. Naturally, without objective and rigorous criticism of everything, there will be no vigilance on the part of the subject, and political struggle is no exception. In the political evolution history of democratic countries, we certainly cannot deny the merits of the opposition party. However, are the opposition's means of opposition aimed at the shortcomings of each political program or policy, and are they suitable for the situation of the country and the nation? This is worth thinking about and exploring. In order to have a factual comparison, we confirm that the opposition parties in European and American democratic countries only express their opposition political views through debates in Congress and forums in newspapers. Then, let us shift our gaze to China to see: Does China really have an opposition party?</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>There is no need to hide the fact that the Chinese Kuomintang is now the ruling party in China. And even if, as some people say, the Communist Party is the current opposition party in China, then we must ask what major things this opposition party has done.</p>
<p>From the Northern Expedition to the present, in the past twenty years, the political programs and policies adopted by the Chinese Kuomintang, we do not need to be taboo, it itself may have considerable errors and shortcomings, which is just like the head of a large family, because the family under its management has repeatedly encountered losses and disasters, and is working hard on the reorganization work after the destruction, naturally there will be many places where it cannot take care of everything, this is a fact. The opposition party stands in its proper position, and of course we cannot demand that it completely forgive certain shortcomings of the ruling party. On the contrary, we hope that it can truly represent the people and point out the shortcomings and remedies at any time, so that the ruling party itself has the opportunity to improve.</p>
<p>For example, the Communist Party says every day that the Kuomintang's policies are wrong, or even that this person is corrupt and that person is engaging in malfeasance. Then, where are the reasons why the policies are wrong, and what methods should be adopted to correct them? What is the fact of corruption? What is the evidence of malfeasance? As long as there are facts, investigations, reasonable propositions, and conclusive arguments, even if the Kuomintang does not pay attention, the people will definitely pay attention. However, the people cannot tolerate the opposition party only engaging in malicious attacks, or even attempting internal chaos. Who does not want to see politics get on the right track immediately? The Communist Party members have mouths, and there are also organizational newspapers, which can be publicly discussed, allowing the people to consider and criticize, and allowing the government to adopt and improve, this is the reasonable means of opposition. I believe that the ruling Kuomintang will not restrict the Communist Party's right to speak in the trend of democracy. Because the government has already recognized the existence of the Communist Party, the Communist Party has its own political status, and representatives of the Communist Party participate in the National Political Council and the upcoming Political Consultative Conference. This clearly proves that the Kuomintang does not adopt an attitude of absolutely not accepting criticism. In any case, the Kuomintang is by no means intentionally condoning corrupt villains. We take the facts since the War of Resistance as proof. The Kuomintang is working hard to punish corruption and clean up officialdom, and the Kuomintang is diligently seeking the people's livelihood and revising its policies at any time to adapt to the needs of the times. This is obvious to all.</p>
<p>With China's vast territory, its large population, its different temperatures, and its different human natures, the father of Wang Zhaoming would never have taught his son to be a traitor when he grew up; I believe that Mr. Mao Zedong's father did not expect that Mr. Mao would be a Communist for the rest of his life. From these facts, we have to think calmly, even if there are bad elements in the Kuomintang, what about the Communist Party itself? Are they all sages? Ask each other's conscience, rely on the principles of nature, and let the people speak freely. How much better is Yan'an, which was ruled by Mr. Mao for eight years, than Chongqing? Is there corruption? Is there robbery? Are taxes what the people are willing to pay? Are the people all allowed to speak freely? This requires Mr. Mao's generation to investigate themselves. Can the Communist Party's books be taken on the streets in Chongqing? Can the New China Daily appear as the Communist Party's organizational newspaper and attack the National Government, but in Yan'an, there is no publication of the Central Daily or other private newspapers or books. Why can't a government that shouts democracy in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region tolerate other parties? Who killed more than a thousand people such as Ju Chao and Gui? Who is exploiting the people with all kinds of donations? The Communist Party stands in the position of the opposition party to the Central Government. Why does it not allow its own opposition party to exist in the areas it occupies? It cannot take care of itself, but specializes in attacking political enemies. Can such a political struggle win the trust of the people?</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us discuss the issue of political struggle. The word "political struggle" clearly means political struggle, not the territorial war of the warlord era and the autocratic era. Even a young student can understand this problem. The main condition of political struggle is to influence or move the masses with the party's theories and facts, so that the masses believe in the party's propositions. Especially the opposition party in the opposition should show that its propositions are reasonable and correct everywhere, and at the same time try to prove the future policies with facts. Only in this way can there be a real opposition force. In the United States, how intense is the political debate between parties during each election period, but they have never raised the party's status above the interests of the country and the nation, nor have they used the army as a tool for political struggle. Why? Because all political struggles are not allowed to violate the survival interests of the country; and the army belongs to the country, and no political party is allowed to regard the army as private like a warlord. If this principle is violated, the political struggle will definitely turn into a military struggle, and the central government that implements the national orders will only have to bear the responsibility of suppressing internal chaos. Just read the history of the American Civil War and the biography of President Lincoln, and you can think about it more than half.</p>
<p>What about China? Let us say with conscience that even if the policies of the Chinese Kuomintang are wrong, or even bad, but at least it has overthrown the Manchu Qing, overthrown the warlords, resisted the violent enemy, recovered the lost land, abolished the unequal treaties, and raised China's international status. These are all iron facts. Is it a dictatorship to the end? The Kuomintang has not restricted the legal activities of all parties, and it has not allowed the existence of dissident parties like the totalitarianism worshiped by the Communist Party. And what about the Communist Party itself? After working hard for twenty years, what is the benefit to the country and the nation? How much loss did the country suffer from the ten years of harassment before the War of Resistance? Ruijin in Jiangxi is still a piece of ashes, and the people will always remember it. Even from the "25,000-mile Long March" history boasted by the Communist Party itself, the people still have lingering pain in the places where the wandering passed. The Communist Party also said, "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and our party is willing to strive for its realization." But after saying this in September 1937, the Communist Party's establishment was the so-called "Anti-Japanese Government" in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As a result, one point was for anti-Japanese, two points were to deal with the Kuomintang, and seven points were to strengthen its own strength. Therefore, it expanded its army, occupied territory, and did anti-unification movements every day. And what did the Communist Party do after the victory of the War of Resistance? Attacking cities, seizing land, destroying transportation, robbing the people, inciting riots, and creating social unrest, are these all considered "political struggle" methods of parties in democratic countries? There are many multi-party countries in the world, and there is more than just the Chinese Communist Party fighting for power, but why is there no other example? Roosevelt was Wilkie's political enemy. How fiercely they fought in the election struggle, but Wilkie lost the election. With Wilkie's power, why didn't he come to a destruction and chaos with President Roosevelt's Democratic Party like the Chinese Communist Party? Churchill made great achievements and succeeded, but when he failed in the election, he quietly let Attlee's Labour Party come to power, and he did not occupy territory with troops, and the British Labour Party did not come to a riot and destruction when it competed for the election!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, political struggle is not a warlord's territorial war. No matter what, both sides of the political struggle should take the interests of the country as their interests. The Communist Party cannot put forward correct political theories to make people believe, and it admits that China should implement the Three Principles of the People today and cannot implement communism, but it insists on using military actions to fight for territory and power, which simply loses the qualifications of a democratic party to engage in political struggle. No one can see any difference from the warlords of the past!</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The opposition party is the lighting lamp of democratic politics, and it should have the style of a lighting lamp. Since the Chinese Kuomintang has not opposed the existence of the Communist Party, the Communist Party can develop its own opinions, political views and its future. Although the opposition party and the ruling party may have different places, but now that the Communist Party claims to be standing in the position of the opposition party, it should correct its own shortcomings, value the lives of the people more, and value the dignity and rights of the country more. Immediately abandon the policy of riots, attacking cities and occupying territory, change the suicidal policy of destroying transportation and damaging industry and mining, stop attacking the national army, and abolish the political power outside the legal government. First, obey the national decrees and military orders, and strive to express the party's propositions with facts, and then it can win the belief of the people. The main goal of political parties is nothing more than to demand political progress for the country and the nation, so that the people can live a good life. Then, we should see the current situation of the country today, and not harm the poor family who has fought hard for eight years, and then suffer from internal chaos. We believe that democratic politics is to move forward step by step. Relying solely on fighting with guns, fighting for land and shedding blood, and dividing the country will not produce democracy! If the Communist Party is truly fond of democracy, I think they should first ask the Chinese people: How many people are willing to hand China over to the Communist Party to be a communist experiment?</p>
<p>China has now set off a fervent trend of democratic thought. We believe that the Chinese Kuomintang is also working hard on democratic political construction. Naturally, we also hope that there will be an ideal opposition party. However, the opposition party that we seek must take the interests of the country and the nation as the premise in the way it engages in political struggle. In order to make political progress, we hope that this opposition party will fight more fiercely and more practically, without rioting and obeying national decrees and military orders, so that China's politics can become clearer and more progressive. Can today's Chinese Communist Party meet this condition? This depends on the Chinese Communist Party to take good care of itself! (34th year, December, 11th, Longtan)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Hong Kong Lifeblood <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, Hong Kong's external transportation was extremely convenient. British, American, Japanese and other shipping companies have regular cargo and passenger ships sailing to Europe. In the Pacific, Hong Kong has American, Canadian, Japanese and other routes. Hong Kong also has transportation relations with Africa, Australia and South America. In the nearby ocean, Hong Kong and India, Java, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan and various ports along the coast of China have regular maritime traffic.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has become a major shipping center, which can be seen from the fact that in 1937, a total of 33,782 ocean and inland river ships (36 million tons) entered and exited Hong Kong. This figure is even larger than the number of ships entering and exiting Shanghai in 1933 and 1934, and perhaps even larger than Kobe, the main port in Japan. British ships accounted for slightly less than half of the ocean ships entering Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to statistics, ocean-going ships accounted for two-thirds of the tonnage of ships entering Hong Kong, and the rest were mostly inland river ships. Although there are many sailboats, they only account for a small part of the tonnage.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Harbor, located between the island and the mainland, forms a natural anchorage for ships. The docks and other anchorage facilities on the mainland can only accommodate twelve ships longer than seven hundred feet. Hong Kong has harbor facilities for various shipping needs, and its convenience is the same as other modern ports in the world. In 1937, there were three warehouse companies in Hong Kong with a total capacity of 500,000 tons of cargo. In addition, there are many private warehouses in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Hong Kong has no shortage of facilities for storing various goods. The two major shipyards have dry docks that can accommodate ships longer than 787 feet; in addition, there are five slipways that can accommodate ships waiting for repair (longer than 390 feet and weighing 4,000 tons). Other smaller shipyards can also repair ships with lighter tonnage. (Translated from Foreign Trade Weekly)</p>

<p>— Chong Bo</p>
<p>Generally More Gains Than Losses</p>
<p>Finance: Last week in the local financial market, the interbank interest rate for silver was stable at three-tenths of a cent. The unofficial rate fluctuated between eight and ten percent. However, due to the rise in domestic and foreign stocks, as well as gold and US dollars, the foundation gradually solidified. Next week marks the end of the Gregorian calendar year, and silver will undoubtedly become tighter. Speculation initially suggested that the US dollar exchange rate would rise to 760,000 yuan. Subsequently, due to a large volume of exports and a sharp drop in the Hong Kong dollar, selling pressure increased, reaching a low of 700,000 yuan. Finally, with easing silver supply and rising domestic and foreign stocks, buying interest revived, rising to 752,000 yuan at closing, an increase of 22,000 yuan from the previous week. Market insiders believe that after the US dollar is fixed, gold will also remain stable at a certain level, similar to the situation before when gold prices stabilized at around 1,100 yuan in the 25th and 26th years. Therefore, they boldly began afternoon forward trading. However, cautious gold merchants are still observing, so afternoon trading is light. Gold jewelry was listed at 2,000 yuan higher per tael, while standard silver remained stable at 600 yuan. Silver coins were 450 yuan each, the same as the previous week. Due to the gradual increase in import and export trade, the demand and supply of US dollars were balanced, fluctuating between 1,170 yuan and 1,280 yuan, finally standing firm at 1,255 yuan, an increase of 35 yuan from the previous week. Hong Kong dollars were stable. There was talk that new Hong Kong dollars were valued at 30%. On Wednesday, sellers emerged, causing the price to plummet from 65 yuan to 45 yuan. Gradually, people in the shipping industry and British merchants from Guangzhou took advantage of the dip to buy, rising back to 50 or 60 yuan at closing, still a decrease of 9 yuan from the previous week.</p>
<p>Securities: Due to optimism about the current situation, the banking sector purchased unified government bonds. Bulls seized the opportunity to squeeze the market and spread news of repayment of Sun Yat-sen bonds and victory subsidies. As a result, Class C bonds reached a peak of 850 yuan, exceeding the face value of 750 yuan by a significant margin. This prompted bulls in the securities industry to take profits and sell, retreating to 700 yuan at closing, still an increase of 100 yuan from the previous week. Due to abundant idle funds and minimal fluctuations in the US dollar, there was no room for movement. Funds flowed into the stock market, with silver firms and bull companies buying. In addition, industry leaders requested the opening of domestic stock trading to revitalize domestic industry, resulting in a surge in buying interest. Major and minor popular stocks rose by 40% to 50%. The stock of Wing On Textile Factory, led by industry leaders, rose sharply due to the active yarn market. Buying interest concentrated, and the stock closed at a new high price of 710 yuan, a significant increase of 225 yuan from the previous week. Foreign stocks rose due to the resumption of operations at foreign factories and purchases by Jewish merchants. Jardine Matheson rose by more than 50%, and Ewo Cotton Mill rose by 40%. Next week is the end of the Gregorian calendar year, and both domestic and foreign stocks are expected to close at new high prices.</p>
<p>Goods: Regarding commodities, the supply of rice was slightly scarce due to the purchase of military rations and restrictions on external transportation in rice-producing areas such as Changshu and Wuxi. In addition, local residents and food vendors purchased more, resulting in an increase of 500 to 1,000 yuan per shi (unit of measurement). Japonica rice stood at 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, while indica rice stood at 6,500 to 7,800 yuan. There were rumors that a French foreign firm had ordered Vietnamese rice at only 4,000 yuan per shi, suitable for the Shanghai market. The situation where Shanghai relied on indica rice to maintain its economy will reappear. The price of flour increased due to rising wheat prices and the implementation of unified wheat flour tax, which increased manufacturers' costs. Buyers were active, and merchants from both the north and south rushed to purchase. Although the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) sold 10,000 bags of charitable, affordable American flour at only 1,900 yuan per bag, the market price of Chinese No. 1 flour still rose to 3,000 yuan, a significant increase of 750 yuan from the previous week, accounting for one-quarter of the total price. Next week, the city will have the second phase of affordable flour retail. At the same time, American wheat continues to be imported. With the world no longer at war, it is believed that flour prices will not rise indefinitely. The price of miscellaneous grains increased due to the impact of land and water transportation costs. Generally, soybeans rose by 400 to 500 yuan, peanuts rose by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and corn rose by 300 yuan. Edible oil prices rose and fell in line with raw materials such as soybeans and peanuts, with each hundred catties increasing by 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil was slightly more expensive than raw oil, by about 10%. The reason is that raw oil freezes and does not look good. Due to the city's sale of affordable Taiwan white sugar at 360 yuan per catty, there were few buyers for red and white sugar on the market, and each dan (unit of measurement) fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. In textiles, merchants from Sichuan and Hankou actively purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The former focused on 20-count and 16-count yarn, which increased by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The latter exclusively favored 12-pound "Dragon Head" white sheeting, which suddenly increased by 5,000 yuan per bolt. Cotton was sought after by factories and cotton firms. Tongzhou fine velvet rose from 40,000 to 60,000 yuan, and "Fire Machine" cotton also rose to 40,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan from the previous week. If compared to 20-count "Double Horse" yarn at 640,000 yuan, it is still equivalent to 11 dan of cotton for one bale of yarn. Due to exports to the United States, the silk market saw a price hike in high-grade white silk fabrics of 90,000 yuan. Tussah silk remained stable. The demand for rayon increased due to the resolution of the labor dispute at the silk factory. 120-count "Sky Bridge" rayon rose by 80,000 yuan per case, to 530,000 yuan. Satin and American-Chinese bedspreads were the most popular, rising by 45,000 yuan per hundred pieces, while the rest remained flat. Although there were inquiries from European and American exporters about tea, market prices were not very stimulating. Only mid-range black tea rose by 1,500 yuan, while the rest softened slightly. Affected by the cold weather, there were more buyers for fuel. Yangquan white briquettes rose by 60,000 yuan, returning to 300,000 yuan per ton. Other small pieces, dust, and shavings rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Coal balls were stable. Firewood sales were sluggish due to rain and snow. Chestnut firewood reached a new low price of 1,200 yuan, and pine firewood was only 900 yuan per dan. Among daily necessities, candles rose by 3,500 yuan per case due to purchases by Sichuan merchants. Matches and soap also rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan each. Due to the price increases by Wing Tai Ho and British American Tobacco, as well as the need for year-end gifts, "Old Knife," "Fairy," and "British American" cigarettes rose by 70,000 to 175,000 yuan, especially "Old Knife." In addition, paper, Western medicine, and industrial raw materials each saw a 10% price increase. Cosmetics were uniquely flat.</p>

<p>The Transportation Department of the China Central Railway Administration has formulated provisional measures for the registration of direct merchants and transshipment companies in order to facilitate freight transportation. All local direct merchants and transshipment companies that have obtained registration certificates from legal authorities can obtain the provisional registration measures from the department in the North Station Building starting immediately. Registration will begin on January 5, 1946.</p>
<p>The Fuel Committee has approved the request of local coal ball manufacturers to supply coal dust, which is sufficient to meet the city's needs. The selling price is also lower than the market price. The allocation for each member is based on their electricity bill.</p>
<p>The local Silver Industry Consumer Cooperative is organized by people in the silver industry, and the person in charge is Pan Yangyao, etc. Recently, it held a fair-price distribution of 克寗 (克寧, Kening) milk powder, scheduled for three days, from the 23rd to the 25th of this month. Those who need it can register in advance. Many factories in Sichuan Province have applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for closure. Those that have been approved include China Industrial Development Corporation, Yuxin Iron and Steel Plant, and 14 others. The remaining applications are still under review. Hua'an and Huigong factories have laid off their workers. Whether these closed factories will resume operations or be reorganized in the future will depend on future economic conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Legal Status of Capital <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>Capital is the only prerequisite for industrial and commercial enterprises. Profit-making businesses must have initial capital investment in order to operate and generate profits. The amount must be calculated in monetary terms and must have a definite amount recorded in the accounts. Therefore, whether the organization is a partnership or a company, except for sole proprietorships, which only require individuals to consider their own financial resources and use them freely, the amount of capital should be specified in the contract or articles of association as the basis for determining the content of the joint contract. Externally, regardless of the organization, there must be a definite amount of capital. Registration with the competent authority is required before it can defend against third parties. The same applies to capital increases or decreases. This is evident in the Commercial Registration Law, the Company Law, the Business Tax Law, and the Income Tax Law.</p>
<p>The Income Tax Law, in Article 8 of the Implementing Rules, provides a more detailed regulation: "The term 'capital' in this law refers to the paid-up share capital of a company or the actual capital invested by other organizations." It also states that "The capital in the preceding paragraph does not include investment in credit or labor." Article 44 states, "The capital of profit-making enterprises in categories A and B of the first class shall be applied for investigation, approval, and registration with the local competent tax collection authority within fifteen days after the start of business. When there is an increase or decrease in capital, an application shall be made within fifteen days from the date of the increase or decrease." It is very clear that capital is the actual invested capital that can be counted in monetary terms, and that it can only defend against third parties after registration. In the Civil Law and the Company Law, unlimited liability shareholders are not prohibited from investing labor and credit, and it is stipulated that they must be calculated as a monetary value and used as capital. This is tantamount to replacing the money that shareholders should invest with other properties of equal value.</p>
<p>The Company Law and the Income Tax Law strictly regulate the valuation standards for capital investment that is replaced by property other than money. After the valuation of shares, shareholders cannot demand the return of this original property in the future, and the operator cannot force the return of this original property to the original shareholders. The property of the enterprise is jointly owned. Once it becomes capital, it is merged with other properties to form the total capital. It is impossible to point out that a certain part is the investment used by a certain shareholder, and blame only this certain shareholder. Today's discussion of reorganizing the book value of capital focuses on the separate calculation of new and old shareholders. The intention is that the investment in legal tender was valuable at the beginning, while the investment in puppet Central Reserve Bank notes was not valuable. Therefore, it is argued that the puppet currency investment portion should be discounted more heavily. Some even argue that it should be converted into capital at a discount of 200 to 1, according to the central government's method of redeeming puppet currency circulating in the market. However, it is not known that except for a few special companies and firms, when puppet currency new capital was collected in addition to the legal tender old capital, the puppet currency was not as worthless as it is now. The puppet currency received has long been combined into the total amount of capital and transformed into other properties. How can it be compared to the current purchasing power of the puppet currency? If we do not recognize the puppet currency as legal tender, its nature is similar to investment in property other than money when it was initially received as shares. The law does not allow operators to forcibly return the original property to the original shareholders at the time of the shareholders' investment.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of the amount of capital, it must be registered with the competent authority before it can defend against third parties. This is entirely for the purpose of obtaining an external position in law. Internally, whether it is a partnership or a company, once a resolution is made in accordance with the law, a partnership agreement is signed, shareholder meeting minutes are recorded, and a share subscription is filled out and the share payment is paid, the contractual act has been established. Even if there is negligence in registration, it will only be subject to fines, and even imprisonment for the actor. It does not broadly abandon the establishment of the shareholder's investment relationship in the partnership or company. The same applies when there is an increase in capital and the registration procedures have not been completed. Before the recovery of the occupied areas, there were many cases where the establishment and change of registration could not be applied for. This is an irresistible force in the environment, and it cannot erase the fact that the internal contract between the partnership and the company and the shareholders will not be shaken. Today's discussion of reorganizing the book value of capital advocates respecting the law, which is the spirit of the rule of law and deserves to be supported. However, it should also be known that the "internal contractual" act should be protected by law. If there are illegal acts in the process of capital increase or decrease, it is another problem, and legal remedies can be sought separately. It cannot be used to erase the general facts.</p>
<p>Some say that for income tax purposes, the book value of capital should be reorganized to a larger amount this year in order to reduce the tax rate. However, this is not the case. According to the Income Tax Law listed above, the increase in capital must take effect after registration. According to the provisions of Articles 37 to 39 of the Implementing Rules, the amount of capital must be calculated on an annual average based on the amount already declared. If it is only raised at the end of the year, it cannot reduce the total tax rate according to the law.</p>

<p>The implementing measures for the Provincial Bank Regulations of various provinces were previously passed by the Executive Yuan. The contents are: (1) If a province has two provincial banks, they should be merged. If there are commercial shares, they should be returned in installments. (2) The directors of provincial banks will be selected by the Ministry of Finance, with four to seven people, and the provincial government will recommend three to six people, which will be reported to the Ministry for approval and appointment. (3) The supervisors of provincial banks will be selected by the Ministry of Finance, with three people, and the provincial councils will elect four people. (4) There are also regulations on the shareholding ratio of autonomous groups. The above measures were originally limited to implementation before the end of this month. It is now known that the vast majority of provinces have reported a delay in implementation because the provincial councils have not yet been formally established and supervisors cannot be elected. It is heard that the authorities intend to approve the request.</p>

It is heard that a committee will be organized first for screening and review. The candidates for the committee have now been agreed upon and will be announced soon. The principle of screening is that the puppet secondary schools taken over by the government will be temporarily converted into cram schools, and all enrolled students will continue to receive instruction. Their grades will be screened after the end of the semester. As for students from puppet schools that have voluntarily closed down, they will first be assigned to various schools to study, and then their grades will be screened to ensure that their studies are not interrupted.

Now that the venue has been restored, of course, money is still indispensable. Most of the students attending today are enthusiastic students and should do their best to donate," and so on.

<h3 id="e65">Landowners in Various Districts of the City Should Register Quickly Mayor Qian's Written Statement Yesterday <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In order to supervise and promote land administration work and to ensure that citizens have a thorough understanding of land registration laws, regulations, procedures, and other issues, Mayor Qian of this city issued the following written statement:</p>
<p>All Procedures Are Simple, Easy, and Fast</p>
<p>"Land registration is prescribed by law and is intended to protect the rights and interests of the people. During the war of resistance in Shanghai, there were many land disputes. Therefore, conducting registration is an important task for resolving disputes. For those who have obtained business licenses before the war in the six districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Hunan, Caojing, and Fahua, they can directly apply for the replacement of land ownership certificates. The procedures are simple, easy, and fast. Those who have not registered must register uniformly. The Land Administration Bureau stipulates that the registration receipt period is from November 19th of this year to January 18th of the 35th year of the Republic of China [1946]. If owners have special circumstances within the stipulated period and cannot apply for registration on time, they can state the reasons and obtain a one-month extension to complete the registration.</p>
<p>Registration Is Also Possible During the Public Notice Period</p>
<p>For land that has already been registered by the owner, after the Land Administration Bureau reviews it and finds no disputes, it will post a public notice for two months. After the public notice period expires, if there are no objections to the property rights, a land ownership certificate will be issued. Therefore, the fastest land registration process takes more than two to three months. At the time of registration, the Land Administration Bureau will issue a receipt. However, some citizens may think that the two-month receipt period is too short. It should be known that after the stipulated period expires, land that has not been registered must go through a public notice procedure. During this public notice period, it is also possible to apply for registration retroactively. If the public notice period is exceeded and there are no legitimate reasons stated, and registration is not applied for, the government will take over the management on behalf of the owner. During the period of government management, registration of property rights can still be made within two years after the end of the war of resistance. Therefore, government management according to law is not a confiscation of the people's property. This is a procedure of registration technique, so I hope citizens will register quickly.</p>
<p>Fees Are Collected According to Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of land registration fees, everything is handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government. For those who apply for the first land ownership registration, the registration fee is charged at four per thousand of the declared land price. For those who apply for registration of land rights acquisition, establishment, transfer, change, or termination, it is uniformly charged at two per thousand of the value of the rights. In the future, when issuing land ownership certificates and land other rights certificates, each certificate will be calculated from one hundred to ten thousand yuan based on the property value. Stamp duty is collected at 6% to 15% of the contract price in accordance with the central government regulations. This is a central government tax, and the municipal government is only temporarily handling it on behalf of the central government.</p>
<p>As for the key personnel responsible for land administration, they are all experts transferred from the Central Land Administration Department and land administration agencies in various provinces and cities. Other staff members are also familiar with land administration matters and all have the service spirit of integrity, efficiency, and amiability, and will be able to complete this task."</p>

<h3 id="e69">Workers of the British Tramway Company Once Went on Strike Yesterday Morning Drivers and Ticket Sellers Demand Wage Adjustment <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The British Tramway Company suddenly experienced a strike at 6:45 AM yesterday. All trams that had already left the factory returned to the factory and stopped running. After learning about this, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent Zhu Chenghao to mediate. The Third Front Army also sent personnel to persuade the workers, and the entire workforce resumed work at 9:30 AM. Labor and management are being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The Labor Unrest Has Been Brewing for a Long Time</p>
<p>According to reporters' investigations, the labor unrest has been brewing for a long time. Since the company was taken over by British businessman Aibelock, it has been experiencing financial difficulties. As a result, for the three months of September, October, and November, the salaries of all employees, more than three thousand people, have been delayed. Each person has only borrowed about 30,000 yuan. The employees have long been dissatisfied and have repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate with the management, demanding the payment of the arrears for the past three months. It is said that over one thousand workers in the Transportation Department and the Mechanical Affairs Department gathered about 400 people on Pei'er Road at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Due to a misunderstanding, they beat Tang Yifang, the ticket-selling representative number 432, and injured him. Also, at about 1:30 PM on the 22nd, the coppersmiths in the Mechanical Affairs Department had disagreements over wage issues and a fight broke out. As a result, one coppersmith died from his injuries.</p>
<p>Unequal Treatment Demands Adjustment</p>
<p>The company authorities, fearing the expansion of the situation, tried to borrow 150 million yuan from the Central Bank and paid the back wages the day before yesterday. However, the track layers, drivers, and ticket sellers, more than one thousand workers in the Transportation Department, believed that their wages were lower than those of other departments and that the company authorities treated employees unfairly. They demanded an adjustment and staged a strike yesterday morning. Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau and Zhu Chenghao of the Social Affairs Bureau formed a team to reply to the workers by 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and the workers resumed work.</p>
<p>Workers Accept the Authorities' Mediation</p>
<p>At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, twelve employee representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau. Aibelock, the general manager of the British Tramway Company, and Harvey, the chief accountant, also came to the scene. Zhang Zhenyuan, the section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhu Chenghao worked hard to mediate and sincerely explained to the employee representatives the authorities' efforts to seek welfare for the workers. The representatives were quite moved and agreed to explain the situation to all the workers. The employees' request for the company to publicize the salaries of all employees has also been approved by the management to be published on Wednesday. At that time, the employees will submit concrete measures for wage adjustments, which will be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for processing.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Minyu Ship Sinks Thorough Investigation of Causes Underway Yesterday, Busy with Salvage <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Minsheng Company's Minyu ship suddenly sank in the Huangpu River at Pier No. 3 the day before yesterday morning. Yesterday, salvage work was in full swing. The goods that have been recovered include cotton yarn, cotton cloth, groceries, and more than ten barrels of diesel fuel, all stacked on the shore of Pier No. 3. However, the ship was carrying a total of more than 460 pieces of cargo and passenger belongings, and less than half of them have been recovered. Most regrettably, a large number of books donated to the Beibei Library by Zeng Bokang, the manager of Ouxin Yusha Factory and Xianfu Company,</p>
<p>a large number of books</p>
<p>were among the cargo. A batch of more than seventy boxes had already been shipped out on the Minquan ship last week, and this was the second batch of fifty boxes (more than one hundred boxes have not yet been shipped), and it has suffered this misfortune. As of yesterday, the unloading work has not yet been completed and will continue today. It is expected that the ship can be floated to the surface tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the company, the sinking of the Minyu ship has caused the company</p>
<p>major losses</p>
<p>After the ship is salvaged, it will have to be put into dry dock for major repairs again. Regarding the passengers, a solution has been negotiated. Those who wish to go to Chongqing immediately can take the Minzu ship, which will set sail for Yichang on the 24th, and then transfer to Chongqing. Otherwise, they can take other Minsheng Company ships within a limited period. As for the lost luggage and other items of the passengers, registration has already been processed yesterday, and they will be returned separately after they are recovered. As for the</p>
<p>issue of responsibility</p>
<p>It is reported that the cause has been investigated, and the company authorities will punish the negligent personnel. Wang Fucheng, the captain of the ship, and Zeng Xianzhang, the cargo chief, are suspected of considerable negligence and have been detained. A decision will be made after the ship is brought out of the water and the responsibility is determined. In addition, Chen Haishan, the pilot who died in the accident, was from Hankou and was sixty years old. He had served for many years. The company authorities believe that the employee has made many contributions in the past and unfortunately died tragically, so they will provide preferential compensation. His body is being salvaged and the customs and water police bureau have been notified. Zhao Zhicheng, another injured ship policeman, is from Sichuan and is over thirty years old. After being rescued, his life is not in danger.</p>

<p>— Mai Tian</p>
<p>The first Christmas after the victory is coming tomorrow, and everyone seems to be more excited than in previous years, buying gifts and planning banquets to have a big carnival. But in fact, this year's Christmas is still not as good as before the war.</p>
<p>"After the great war, people have lost their vitality. Many people cannot even afford a winter coat today, and many people are wandering on the streets, unable to find shelter. Not to mention the poor, even some middle-class families often have empty rice jars and oil tanks. Where do they have the qualifications to enjoy happiness? Here, Christmas is a holiday exclusively for a limited number of classes. But the limited classes are limited after all. Isn't it? You will find that there are far fewer people buying fancy gifts in department stores than in previous years. Although there is a lack of imported goods this year and there is no way to decorate, even outside the few brightly decorated tree windows, there are only a few onlookers. Flower baskets and foreign wines decorated very beautifully with many patterns, but the number of people asking about them is not enthusiastic. Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, Christmas trees are arranged in long rows at the entrances of flower shops, but they are not as lush as walking into a park like walking past Little Sandu Road and Jing'an Temple Road in the past.</p>
<p>Having said that, those who can breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy themselves to the fullest on Christmas will not want to miss this opportunity. Dance halls, cafes, restaurants, and theaters will undoubtedly be crowded. Many dance halls and restaurants have already been booked. No matter how expensive the Christmas dinner is, many guests have already booked it. However, some Western restaurants are preparing for a big sacrifice, only adding dishes but not increasing prices. Although the weather station reports that there may be no snow scene to decorate Christmas, the bands in the dance halls, restaurants, and tea rooms have already been playing the beautiful song "White Christmas" to welcome Christmas. In addition, many people take advantage of this rare holiday to travel to Hangzhou and Suzhou, which is a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>Christmas is not yet considered a major event in the eyes of Chinese people, but for foreigners, it is very different. Christmas is more important than the New Year. The U.S. military's department stores and Chinese antique embroidery shops shipped a large number of Christmas gifts to the United States weeks ago. But the American soldiers also think that things are too expensive and don't want to buy much. The British Red Cross held four banquets to entertain European children staying in Shanghai. The American Red Cross is inviting 25 Chinese children to participate in a Christmas party at Jiangwan Airport and distributing candies and gifts. The gifts given by the British Information Office to all employees were especially rich, with each person receiving a large cardboard box containing cigarettes, candies, and various things. The American Red Cross will ship 75,000 gift packages from Calcutta, India, to British soldiers in China. The "parties" of the British army in Shanghai will be distributed everywhere, and canned turkeys have already been shipped. It is said that the police bureau has agreed to the request of the British army to temporarily relax the curfew tonight. Therefore, most of the all-night "parties" are already being planned. Finally, I sincerely appeal to Santa Claus on behalf of those children who lost their parents during the war, can he please change his policy and shift his target this year, and go to the slums to give alms!"</p>

Except for the five steam engines of Chongxin Yarn Factory, which were installed before the war, the rest were installed within the last two years. The result of the installation of prime movers by various factories has alleviated the coal panic problem of power plants. In the past, power plants needed 150,000 tons of coal per month, but now 80,000 tons per month can be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e77">City Finance Bureau Official Talks About the Truth of Levying Business Tax, There is No Penalty of 20 Times <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>It was recently heard that the two Central Commissioners, based on the merchants' statements, telegraphed the Central Government regarding the city's business tax matter: (1) The business tax has not yet been transferred to the Direct Taxation Bureau. (2) The Direct Taxation Bureau announced that it would be levied from October 21st of this year in accordance with the Ministry's order. (3) The Finance Bureau not only retroactively collected the business tax before October 21st but also imposed a penalty of 20 times the amount on merchants who failed to pay on time, which concerns government orders and public opinion, and requested a ruling. After inquiring with the Shanghai Finance Bureau and the City Chamber of Commerce, the person in charge of the Finance Bureau stated: (1) The business tax was originally a local tax, and the Central Government in Shanghai has never collected it. Since the establishment of the Direct Taxation Bureau, the city government has been in consultation with the Ministry of Finance on whether to entrust the local government to collect it on its behalf, so as to save time and expenses with the existing mechanism and be familiar with the situation, achieving twice the result with half the effort. After repeated consultations, a decision has not yet been made, so it has not been transferred. (2) Direct Taxation Bureau Notice No. 29 states that it will be levied from the date of the establishment of the bureau. October 21st is the date of the establishment of the bureau. The city government and various bureaus were established on September 12th. Before the tax was transferred and the bureau was established, it should still belong to the local government. (3) The business tax is collected quarterly. Some paid during the puppet regime, and some did not. Since it is not convenient to return the paid ones, in order to be fair and reasonable, only those who have not paid will be retroactively collected. On the one hand, it was found that the tax rate of the puppet regime was lower than that stipulated by our Central Government. In order to show consideration for the people's hardship, the original tax rate was still used. In fact, the business books of various merchants at that time were counterfeit money, and since the tax was levied according to the original rate and then converted into legal currency at a discount of 200 to 1, the amount was actually very limited. The total amount for spring and summer is only over 43 million, which is not even one-third or one-quarter of the current monthly collection of entertainment and banquet taxes. It is purely for the purpose of rectification and cleaning up and is not intended to increase the burden on the people. (4) Regarding the penalty of 20 times for late payment, it was found to be half to five times, which was handled in accordance with the provisions of the Business Tax Law, and there was no penalty of 20 times. If there was, it was only the special consumption tax collected by merchants on behalf of the puppet regime. Because the merchants had collected it from consumers and repeatedly urged them to pay, they were delayed in paying, which would be tantamount to embezzling public funds, so the penalty was increased in the hope of early settlement. In fact, those who paid on time were also required to pay, and there were not many who were penalized. When asked about the above matters, the Chamber of Commerce stated that they were also true.</p>

<h3 id="e81">National Ship Allocation Committee's Takeover Principles Have Been Stipulated, Ship Allocation Methods Proceeding Smoothly <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government paid special attention to water transportation. The Ministry of Communications has divided the handling of enemy and puppet ships into three stages. First, a Ship Reception Committee was established, with Shen Zhongyi as the chairman. When the reception of enemy and puppet ships was completed, the Jinghu District Ship Consolidation Committee was established, with Liu Hongsheng as the chairman. At the same time, the Ship Reception Committee was abolished. Last month, the Consolidation Committee completed the consolidation of enemy and puppet ships and was reorganized into the National Ship Allocation Committee, with Liu Hongsheng as the chairman, to allocate ships and supply military and public transportation matters. The committee's organization regulations consist of 15 articles, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record by the Ministry of Communications. The four principles of the takeover method are recorded below: (1) All water transportation agencies that have been ordered to be abolished shall handle the closing matters themselves. (2) Except for the existing transportation tools of each agency that can be used for long-distance transportation, all of which shall be temporarily received by the Allocation Committee and handed over to the China Merchants Bureau for unified allocation and use, the rest shall still be handled by each agency itself. (3) Before the establishment of the committee and its subordinate agencies, the allocation of military and public transportation matters shall still be temporarily handled by the original agencies. (4) The committee's Shanghai and Chongqing offices are scheduled to be established on December 1st, and its subordinate agencies should be established at the same time, depending on the actual situation, to avoid delays. The committee has been established for half a month, and everything is proceeding smoothly. Before the completion of military and public transportation affairs, there will be no more changes in the organization.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Spirit of Traditional Chinese Painting and National Integrity <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese painting can cultivate temperament and influence humanity. Its essence and subtlety lie not only in the training of techniques but also in the cultivation of character. Therefore, famous painters throughout the ages have possessed extraordinary character and a serene demeanor. The spirit of peace and detachment of our Chinese nation is fully expressed in traditional Chinese painting, inspiring and arousing those who are indulgent in desires, ignorant of reason, greedy for profit, and forgetful of righteousness to be vigilant and repentant. Wu Daozi of the Tang Dynasty created the "Hell Transformation Painting," which caused executioners to abandon their careers out of fear of crime, demonstrating its transformative power. Other religious Buddhist paintings, lyrical landscape paintings, historical figure paintings, and aesthetic flower and animal paintings are all solemn, simple, gentle, and faithful, attracting and inspiring deep reflection, with inexplicable wonders.</p>
<p>Since traditional Chinese painting contains this subtle spirit, over time, it has become a widespread and profound concept of elegance. From emperors and generals to scholars and students, all strive to learn it in order to sing of elegance, forming a strange and wonderful flower and fruit of national culture. Whenever foreign insults and national crises occur, upright individuals leisurely retreat, and all their loyal and passionate emotions for serving the country are entrusted to painting. Everything, from vigorous and unyielding pine and cypress trees to fragrant and quiet orchids, pure white winter plums, steadfast and virtuous green bamboos, self-admiring frost chrysanthemums, unsullied landscapes, and non-worldly figures, becomes the object of traditional Chinese painting, symbolizing their lofty and loyal patriotic thoughts. Retreating to the mountains and forests, being leisurely and free, seems rather passive on the surface, but in fact, holding this non-cooperative attitude, pouring emotions into painting, awakens the Chinese people. Figures such as the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, and Ni Yuanlu and Zheng Suonan of the Ming Dynasty, inspired by loyalty, righteousness, and a strong sense of justice, with their feelings for their homeland overflowing in their works, not only alerted the shameless traitors of the time but also, thousands of years later, when people unroll the scrolls, they are touched and admire the scenery, giving people a feeling of strictness and integrity, comparable to the national heroes who served on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese painting can express national integrity. Since it is so profound and great, and the deeds of loyal painters in history are so inviolable, the influence of the trend is far-reaching. Therefore, during the eight years from the Anti-Japanese War to the victory, the traditional Chinese painters in the occupied areas were able to strictly adhere to their positions and endure hardships, and they did not disgrace their predecessors. Even the few calligraphers who were forced to compromise due to the environment still expressed in their works a sense of remaining waters and broken mountains, songs of sadness and generosity, and their hearts longing for their homeland, which had not diminished in the slightest. Now that the rivers and mountains have been restored and the world has been restored, it is deeply hoped that my colleagues in the field of traditional Chinese painting will understand that traditional Chinese painting has a unique spirit of safeguarding national integrity. The depth of its meaning is the highest level of world art. Strengthen efforts, continue to expand and create excellent and unique works of the times, spread them all over the world, so that all mankind is immersed in the rich, peaceful, and detached Chinese painting, understand the inviolable national integrity of our nation, eliminate all cruel and ferocious things, and together ascend to a happy world of equality and harmony.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Fallen Leaves in the Wind and Rain <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>A thin layer of light ink wash shrouds the sky. Dark clouds line the horizon, resembling a transforming black dragon, or a ferocious and terrifying demon, making a frightening appearance that causes one to sigh deeply with a sense of endless melancholy. The wind blows with a rustling sound, not piercingly cold, but winter is still terrible, bringing a shivering chill that soaks the air in a murky, desolate, and depressing environment. Added to this is a drizzling rain that has been falling all night, leaving many puddles on the road. The streets are sparsely populated in the early morning. Indeed, no one wants to go out in this gloomy and bitter weather, especially on this usually quiet road, where only two rows of withered plane trees quietly accompany the cold wind and silent rain, forming a desolate and bleak picture.</p>
<p>The plane trees have lost their crowns; the vibrant green leaves are long gone! Only some withered, yellowed leaves remain on the branches, unable to withstand the ravages of the harsh wind. They lie down, shake, frown, and look sorrowful, unsure of how much longer they can survive. In twos and threes, they are blown away from their mother's embrace, falling to the ground, into the ditches, and into the puddles, with tears streaming down. On a clear day, they could still linger on the ground, rolling with the north wind, rustling. But now? They stick to the slippery ground, submerged in the puddles, gradually becoming stained! Waiting for people's merciless trampling. Sympathetic souls! Can you not hear their final lament? "Mother! Why are people warming themselves by the stove while I suffer unreasonable abuse here?" But the north wind and bitter rain continue to mercilessly harm these innocent little lives. The fallen leaves fall piece by piece with sorrow. Only the leaves that still have some green and yellow hues, not yet withered but about to decay, still cling to their mother's embrace, struggling with the enemy, struggling, awaiting their final fate!</p>
<p>Fallen leaves! Don't be haggard, don't shed any more tears! Which creature in the world doesn't share your fate? Even people! You think they are the luckiest of all! But they too cannot escape this misfortune, and may even suffer a more unfortunate fate than you. When they are young, strong, and full of vitality, when their reputation is high and their power is evident, what kind of person, what kind of environment does not flatter them, fawn over them, and bow down to them? What kind of person, what kind of environment does not compliment them, humbly praise them, and gild the lily? But when they become old, weak, and reach the end of their road, when their reputation declines and their power disappears, what kind of person, what kind of environment does not mock them, despise them, bully them, and humiliate them? What kind of person, what kind of environment does not become arrogant, overbearing, and wantonly ridicule them? Fallen leaves! Although you are now groaning under the iron hooves of wind and rain, you are old! You are haggard! Youth cannot be repeated, and beauty cannot last forever. But when the sky clears, the sun shines on the earth, and the cold wind dries your body, there will be a cleaner to take care of you, to sweep you away and put you in a dustpan. There will also be a poor woman who pities you, to collect you and put you in a broken basket. Although your end is still a dirty garbage can, a blazing stove; don't grieve, don't be sad! This ending is at least better than being humiliated and wantonly ridiculed when people reach the end of their road, isn't it? Much better, isn't it?</p>

<p>— Shangguan Shen</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story:</p>
<p>A few months after the September 18th Incident, a notice was posted on the streets of the northeastern provinces, recruiting laborers. It didn't specify what was being built, but the generous compensation attracted many unemployed compatriots.</p>
<p>They signed up, and a few days later, they were transported by truck to a large building. In the dead of night, these deceived people entered the building one by one.</p>
<p>Inside this building, they began to work.</p>
<p>The work—was to dig a tunnel under the building, to build an arsenal there.</p>
<p>Except for two meals a day, they received nothing. All day long, they dug and piled in the dark cellar. If anyone was lazy, a whip would leave a bloody mark on their back.</p>
<p>Some couldn't bear the hardship and asked to quit. They would give you an injection in your arm or knee, and you would go blind, open your mouth, and become mute, your whole body feeling numb.</p>
<p>And new workers were constantly being recruited.</p>
<p>Three months passed, and an arsenal with all sorts of secret equipment was completed. Those who had lived through ninety days of hell looked at each other with bloodshot eyes, waiting. They felt guilty, realizing that they had done something wrong, something wrong that was now completed. They no longer hoped for the brutalizers to pay them, but only wanted to be let out, to go home, to tell every Chinese person: under that grand building is an arsenal that will slaughter countless compatriots.</p>
<p>The day they had been waiting for finally arrived. Dozens of Japanese military police led them out of the underground. It was dark and gloomy outside, late at night.</p>
<p>They were herded into trucks. A dozen trucks disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>Day after day passed, and patches of blood floated on the calm river surface. People curiously fished them out. Corpses floated up, not just one, but ten, a hundred…</p>
<p>This was the reward for their work for the Japanese.</p>
<p>Ten years passed in a flash. No one could forget the bloodstains of ten years ago. The wives and children of those who were murdered were still alive, waiting for the day when those who killed their husbands and fathers would repay this blood debt.</p>
<p>Those rapists finally drank their own poison. They learned a lesson, but they did not receive the retribution they deserved.</p>
<p>Were the sacrifices of those thousands upon thousands of compatriots who were drowned at sea in vain?</p>
<p>I accuse!</p>

<p>During the war, the Japanese invaders had what was called the "Cultural Service Association." This was an organization of painters, musicians, and playwrights who went to the battlefield to encourage the invasion with their skills. In 1942, this Cultural Service Association published a collection called "Sketches from the Front," published by the Japan Telegraph Communication Agency. The book was a large, sixteen-format volume of 290 pages, two-thirds of which were illustrations and one-third text, recommended by the Ministry of the Army and prefaced by Sakurai. Needless to say, the book was full of insults to China and boasts of the Japanese invaders. Here is a quick example: On page 150 of the book, the top half depicts a large pig, two small pigs, and two geese. The bottom half is a pig song that says:</p>
<p>"Black and clumsy you,</p>
<p>When we first occupied the Wusong Paper Mill,</p>
<p>It was you we met!</p>
<p>A pig indeed, what a surprise!</p>
<p>But knowing that, it seems kind of cute.</p>
<p>So is your master.</p>
<p>So is your country.</p>
<p>I’m so busy, but I need to know your business!”</p>
<p>The author is a fellow named Takaezawa Keiichi, probably a painter, as he drew quite a few pictures in the book. This enemy who insulted us as pigs may still be in Shanghai, living in a beautiful apartment, treated with respect as a cultural figure, invited to tea parties to talk about East Asian civilization!</p>
<h3 id="e96">What Kind of Painting Do We Need? <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Many people are asking: What kind of painting does China need at this stage?</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese painters say: We should promote our inherent art and promote national culture. The current stage is a period of national reconstruction, and the essence of the country should be preserved. So we need traditional Chinese painting.</p>
<p>Oil painters say: Oil painting has rich expressiveness and scientific production methods. In the national reconstruction stage, we still need to absorb nutrients. Therefore, oil painting is the most needed art form.</p>
<p>Cartoonists say: Cartoons are an art that guides the public and exposes reality. How should the public proceed in the era of national reconstruction? What should a reasonable reality be like? Only cartoons can best shoulder this task. So cartoons are the most needed painting at present.</p>
<p>In the national reconstruction stage, the essence of the country should be preserved, foreign culture should be absorbed, and the correct grasp of the theme of art is also very necessary. However, the expressiveness of traditional Chinese painting is weak, oil painting lacks the characteristics of Chinese national art, and cartoons only have momentary publicity and stimulation. Using them to coordinate the process of national reconstruction and obtain the revival of Chinese art is not enough. I think that the kind of painting we need at this stage is: a theme that fits reality, a grand, vigorous, and sublime momentum, which must be extracted from the techniques of cartoons and the spirit of traditional Chinese painting. However, if the expressiveness of oil painting cannot be possessed, the result will still fall into emptiness and weakness. Because oil painting today is no longer an art unique to Westerners, but an art of the world, just as airplanes and cars are not transportation tools unique to the West, but tools that can be used by all mankind.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Time <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Flipping through the calendar, the pages fly by one by one. Days are like a stream of turbid water, flowing without stopping. Life is a lump of mud, dyed by dirty water, becoming even dirtier.</p>
<p>Hope is even more endless. The days always increase and never decrease. Time, past, never returns, piling up in countless heaps behind us. Without a moment to breathe, we welcome the days flying over us again. Joy and sorrow, the past has become a relic, piled together; the future is endless, unpredictable.</p>
<p>Smiles are like dreams, but frowns appear real. People have an unnecessary selfishness and jealousy, thinking that joy is always empty, intangible, and that sorrow pierces the heart like a sword. When everything becomes a relic, when tolerance and generosity reach this level, people also get old. Beauty and youth float in the gentle song of regret. The wrinkles on the face are the track of life. Experience is the deep mark carved on a smooth face. Beauty and loveliness should be submerged in the passing time. Youth is only once, and all enjoyment becomes empty. Therefore, "Alas, life is a dream!"</p>
<p>But sorrow and dissatisfaction pierce the heart like a sword. Reality is a cruel whip, not allowing people to have a moment of forgetful joy. Time flows as quickly as possible. After one day, there is tomorrow. Having endured enough suffering of sorrow, hope also accumulates more and more.</p>
<p>Everything turns into relics, following the passage of time. Sorrow is thrown behind us, and greater hope is hidden in the years to come.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Haiyan After the Calamity <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>My hometown, Haiyan in Zhejiang Province, is located in a strategic position in the Qiantang River. Without layered mountains and peaks or vast floods, it is located on a plain with convenient transportation and prosperous commerce. In Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, it was planned to be developed into a major Eastern port, and it was essentially an important national defense fortress.</p>
<p>After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese army used Haiyan and Jinshanwei as landing points: concentrating artillery fire and fiercely attacking day and night. The National Army could not withstand it, fighting and retreating, and finally fell into enemy hands in mid-October.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army first occupied Haiyan, it went without saying that they massacred, looted, and set fires. They captured young men and tied them together with iron wire through their palms, or tied them to trees, and then slaughtered them with machine guns or bayonets. If they were lucky enough to recover, they were thrown into the swamps, without a single survivor. Their barbaric behavior was utterly inhumane and chilling.</p>
<p>All the buildings in the city were burned, becoming a pile of rubble, only feeling a sense of desolation. The former public education hall, library, and sports ground facilities were all destroyed, and the education cause was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The city walls were collapsed by artillery fire. The Tianning Pagoda was also penetrated by shells, covered in wounds, and in danger of collapsing. The generators and streetlights and poles in the electric power company before the war were all planned to be carried away by the Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>Now the market is sluggish, and it feels even more desolate at night. Tracing back to the prosperity of the past cannot help but make people feel depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Water <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Li Chunkang</p>
<p>Hot water costs ten yuan per scoop, and it is not easy to drink a cup of boiling water. The common people are in deep water and scorching fire.</p>
<p>The importance of a stove is second only to the water supply. It is simply nonsense for them to freely raise prices without the approval of the authorities.</p>
<p>Stoves have never been as free to operate as ordinary stores and have regulations on location. Ordinary stores are also subject to price limits, but stoves with special regulations are acting recklessly, and it is absolutely necessary to impose emergency sanctions.</p>
<p>How to sanction them? The only way is to transfer the stove to the management of the Public Works Bureau, so that every move is subject to the strict management of the municipal authorities, so that it will no longer be manipulated by the guild like an ordinary store.</p>

<h3 id="e100">World Art Capital <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Before World War II, needless to say, Paris was the world's art capital, but since the Nazis occupied it in 1940, the position of the world's art capital naturally disappeared.</p>
<p>Where should the world's art capital be established today? This naturally depends on the traditional cultural, political, and economic conditions.</p>
<p>However, we must also note that today's art is bound to develop with the rise of the spirit of democracy. In other words: today's art is working for the culture, freedom, and happiness of mankind. It will not be sentimental and decadent art, or deformed and morbid expressions.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the foundation of the world's art capital lies in the country that can best express the spirit of democracy in the world. There is no doubt about this.</p>

<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>Classmate Ci Hui's family fell into a puppet state. Thinking of his homeless soul, I felt even more keenly the vicissitudes of our home and country. I write this to mourn him.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of the family and country are endlessly regrettable; our classmates shed hot tears together—returning to Liaotian is too unbearable to grieve; the rivers and mountains still seem the same as before, but human affairs are completely different! The remnant game after the calamity is like this, it's so pitiful that the soul is homeless! The bird of fine feathers does not fly to the mountains of Shu; watching the border passes, azaleas are stained with blood.</p>

<h3 id="e102">How to Improve Teachers' Lives <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Fei</p>
<p>Education is the lifeblood of the country. In countries with developed education, the knowledge, thoughts, behavior, integrity, etc. of their citizens must have good performances, full of vigor and energy. Today, our country can be called "New China." To popularize future education, we should first pay attention to the serious problems of current teachers' lives. The refugee and child shelter established by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is quite large in scale. The other day, a university professor surnamed Zhu suddenly sent his three daughters and two sons to request accommodation. His reason was that his meager salary was not enough to make ends meet, and it was better to seek a way out than to starve to death sooner or later. He had a total of eight children. After careful consideration, he selected the group that was relatively young and sent them to the shelter with heartache. The oldest was already sixteen years old, and the youngest was less than four years old. A university professor is so poor, and the situation of others can be imagined. Compatriots with compassion will never remain indifferent! The author dares to ask the wise authorities to quickly plan a practical and effective way to save these poor and sacred teachers who are "pale, without a drop of oil in their stomachs," pigeon-like, crane-faced, hungry, and cold. Teachers are indeed people with great merits to the country and society. They will not "wear long sleeves to dance well," but only know how to work hard and educate talents for the country and nation. Therefore, European and American countries have special preferential regulations for teachers. Thinking of how important the education cause of "New China" is, improving treatment is urgently needed.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Inquiring About Half-Price Treatment for Lung Disease <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shen Bao reader Cheng Jichao wrote: "Editor: I have read about 'Worry-Free Theory of Lung Disease' in your column for several days, which reminds me that I had hemoptysis four years ago. After being treated with 'air needle' injections at the Nanyang Hospital, the symptoms disappeared completely in just over three months. The doctor said that I needed to have injections for a year, but as a result, I could no longer afford them due to economic reasons. At the same time, after another medical X-ray, it was determined that there was no disease in the lungs, so I automatically stopped the injections. There have been no symptoms for four years, but in the past six months, there seem to be recurring symptoms. I am a store employee with a minimum monthly income. Getting reasonable treatment is like 'taking the moon from the sky,' which is desirable but unattainable. Knowing that this will become incurable if it continues, what can I do about economic hardship? Therefore, I dare to inquire in your column: Is there any place in Shanghai that provides free or cheap X-rays? After the X-ray, are there any free or cheap treatment hospitals? I ask that you publicly answer these two questions so that I can follow them with gratitude."</p>
<p>(Editor's Answer) Our column specifically offers Tongde Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, and Hongqiao Sanatorium, which can provide half-price X-ray examinations, and treatment can also be preferential. Please come for treatment after the examination.</p>
