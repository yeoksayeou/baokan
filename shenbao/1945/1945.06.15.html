<h3 id="c5">論江蘇省食糧增產問題 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 陳耀溪</p>
<p>就品種改良及推廣優種論江蘇省食糧增產問題</p>
<p>安藤廣太郎氏於「稻作之問題」一文中指出，日本於過去五十年中稻米產量之增加約及二倍，即對一定面積每年約平均增產百分之一以上。考其歸大原因，　為品種改良及推廣後種。江蘇省重要食糧作物，其品種之系統極爲複雜，即水稻一項之秈·粳·糯三類之早·中·晚三種，除同名異質擴同質名者外，至少在一千二百種以上。此　　之品種分散各地。栽植之農民旣不知選種採種爲何事，復缺乏退化。　父·突變等育種學識，故其間有極優良之品種，亦有極不優良之品種。</p>
<p>事變後因各地之環境及經濟變異甚巨，致每畝之平均產米量相去益鉅。糧據三十二月，蘇州地區中部六縣合作社聯合水爾增收品評會所得成績，吳縣·吳江·元錫·　山·常州·當熟六縣出品水稻二百多點中，其收量之最高者為每畝三·八九石，最低者為每畝一·二二石，成一與三·一九之比，相去之鉅殊足驚人。綜觀全體成績其收量在三石以上者約佔十分之一，在三石以下者約佔十分之二，其他均在二三石之問，此為江蘇省最　腴之六縣，提供於品評會所示之成績，其他各縣單位而積產米量之實況，當可斷言平均數字更這為低下，而對改進方面有極大之必要。</p>
<p>事變前江蘇省對稻作之改進，大部份致力於育種方面。其由純系育種法育成之品種，計有江蘇省立稻作試騐塲之三二四·三一八·三四八號等粳稻，及二九八·三〇四號等無芒晚粳。松江分塲之蔗粳靑稻·八字稻。高郵分塲之紅壳秈稻。金陵大學之一三八六·二八七·一六五九號等秈稻。中央大學之八十籽，江寗洋秈·帽子頭等等，於推廣栽培上均有極大之成績。惟往昔之品種改良法，若應用於現在之環境下，則有下列三點應加</p>
<p>純系與雜交育種法雖爲品種改良上最基本之合理科學方法，唯此法需時甚久而耗費亦大，於目前中國經濟支絀而急需食糧增產之際，我人當利用最經濟之方法及最短促之時間，獲得最大之知果。</p>
<p>過去育種之取材，皆爲採選各處之單穗而試騐，其採選地點旣隨遇而安，而採運之品種亦不過農家種類之什一，各地之眞正優種不易覓得，設使僥倖覓得，亦因適應性之不同，仍不能普遍揚廣而實惠於農家。</p>
<p>農業有區域性，氣候性，時間性，適於甲地之品系未必適於正地，更以我國幅員之大，習慣風俗之互異，耕作制度之不同，對農作物選擇之影響極大。故從事改良工作者，應對地方原有品種，認定係一種有相富價值之純系而處置之。</p>
<p>綜上三點，對品種之改良除實行純糸或雜交育種法外，更應積極實行普遍之品種比較法，征集地方上所有之一切品糸加以試騐，此淘汰劣質提高優良品糸之地位，使地方品種趨於絕對純糸化，再加以積極之推度，則地方生產可有較佳之進步。其實施之第一步試騐，於民國二十四年在湖南省開始進行，其方法如下：</p>
<p>全省分爲若干大區，以一縣爲單位，合四五縣爲一小區，四五小區爲一大區。</p>
<p>第一年征集每一單位內所有之稻作品種，於該區內施行普遍之品種比較試騐？</p>
<p>第一年所得之優良品種，於第二年加入大區內施行比較試騐，並與各小區間互相交換此較試騐之。　　第二年試騐證明優良之品種，再擴大施行於省區或各大區間交換試騐之。</p>
<p>如某品糸於四年內，經各區試騐皆證明爲優良者，則採用爲該地之純糸品種供推廣之用，省縣地方政府及農業機關，得勸告或强迫農民種植之。</p>
<p>戰後省府以霍濟拮据，對育種事業復毫無基礎，唯仍不辭艱苦極力推行，如三十二年江蘇省府按糧食部擬具之糧食增產三年計劃，先後就其急要而財力所及者推進如下：</p>
<p>各縣農業改進區之調整－將所屬下層機構之組織加以調整，設立南京·句容·鎮江·丹陽·武進·無錫·吳縣·　山·常熟等處。</p>
<p>稻作育種塲之籌設－為積極繁殖優種，已成立育種塲三處，計南京·松江·　山，共三六〇畝。常熟設特約育種塲一處計四〇畝。</p>
<p>實施採種－省府於三十二年十月十八日公佈「江蘇省三十二年度稻作採種縣」，計有吳縣·吳江·江陰·武進·松江·　山·青浦·金山·大倉·常熟等處。</p>
<p>準此而論，江蘇省之食糧增產，於育種上之關係極大，若優良品種能被普遍採用，而使每畝之產量增加至三石，則江蘇省之產米量即能較現在增加一半，換言之可年增一千餘萬石，多供五百萬人之食糧。故江蘇省用品種改良及推廣優種法增加食糧生產，其前途殊可樂觀也。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c7">再申學校疏散之議 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>本市人口疏散問題，鑒於邇來時局及物價問題之嚴重化，應亟積極進行。疏散委員會原定疏散步驟，首先是各慈團體。第二步就將是學校，即中等學校專科學校尤其是各大學，急須迅速設法實行疏散。</p>
<p>本年二月二十日社　中，我們早已提出疏散學校問題。共後因爲疏散地點及疏散交通等問題，尚待各方面積極籌　·現在疏散地點已有洞　山角　爭地，環境極佳，尤共適宜於設　學校。而交通運輸問題，亦由疏散委員會負責交通部分，　有辦法，因此對於學校疏散問題，實有　申　議的需要。</p>
<p>中　及專科以上學校疏散，純從教育立塲而　，　無時局及物價等特殊原因·也有考慮之必要。第一，近數十年來中國文化教育，形成　中於　干部市的　畸形　現象，而爲全國各地文化程度度平衡發展的主要原因。所以今後國家教育計劃，必須都市與鄉村均衡並重，特別注意鄉村內中等專科以上教育之發展；第二，中高級學校集中於大都市，尤其像目前上海這樣的都市，對於一般靑年學生之學業，實有害而無利。鄉村子弟·素質純樸，一員踏進奢糜浮華的上海都市，耳濡目染，往往未得教益，却先蒙受了惡習　，殊非國家社會培育人材之福。</p>
<p>反之，上海的中等及專科以上學校向鄉村疏散，則更有下列利益：第一，鄉村環境，淸凈樸質，青年求學，不受誘惑旁騖，學業易有成就；第二，靑年學生接近鄉村，可以深入農村社會，藉知稼穡維艱和了解農民疾苦，今後中國的改造，農村改造依然是根本問題，所以中大學生熟悉農村，對於將來中國之建設大有裨助；第三，高級學校接近農村，可將時代思潮及科學事物介紹到文化比較落後的農村中間，逐漸提高其文化水準及國家社會　念，破除迷信的傳統習慣，推進建設及農業改良運動，實獻更大。</p>
<p>現在已届署假之期，我們希望本市教育及各校當局考慮實行疏散問題，尤其希望各大學當局共同計　，集體疏散，辦鉀聯合大學，一方面可以分工合作，節省人力財力物力，同時，划於教授人才，更可減去兼職奔走之苦，而內地生活費用較廉，又可安心教育。在此暑期內，完成一切準備與實行工作，暑期以後，即可以新姿熊在鄉村出現。洞庭西山環境優美，房屋亦可利用，蘇省當局對於疏散前往的團體機關，早已懇切表示充分予以協助　利。</p>
<p>除了各大學聯合疏散以外，其他規模較大的中　學校及專科學校，也應設法儘速疏散。至於疏散後的學生問題，我們認爲是不必顧慮的；因爲，第一，　譽去著的學校，學生家長　不疏散至周一地　，亦心為其子弟學業而仍資送子弟隨　入學；第二，鄉村生活費用較低，學生家長負担可以減輕；第三，家長隨同疏</p>
<p>最後，我們希望一般爲父兄者，當此時局嚴重及物價高漲之際，爲子弟學業前途計，爲子弟　輕負担計，都應該贊助學校的聯合疏散運動。</p>
<h3 id="c8">華北經濟施策　將有大轉換　以適應當前重大時局 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電華北經濟施策，爲適應當前時局需要，將有重大變革，自日方實施對華新政策以來，軍管理工塲及各皺山等，或作爲中國法人，或山中日合辦。至於物價政策，則採取低廉物價政策，為實行計，乃實施强有力之經濟對錧政策。過去日本方式之統制，因忽視華方　濟習慣及物資交流方式，故收效極微。加之，委交華方之根本方針，僅屬表面之舉，在實質上並未委交華方，於是日方對華新政策之理想乃發生相反之效界。質　之，即未充分獲得華方之協力。職是之故，地下資源及地上資源之開發，以及治安之確保，未能收獲所期之成果。自去年底以來，華北軍民對此已加以反省，故而華北經濟施策將有重大轉換。查日方對華北新政策之理念，始終爲遂行對華新政策之基本理念，即始終尊重中國民族之傳統與特性，充分利用此點，以完成中國民衃所熱望之民族革命，一方面，日方所欲爲者，在集中一切經濟機構權限，於完成戰爭一點上。另一方面，委托華方負起自主活動之責任，若用具體之事實證明此點，當可明瞭華北經濟開發之動向。</p>
<p>廢止經濟封鎖政策　　止經濟對鎖，過去固定物價政策之思想，已予廢棄，而代之以安定物價政策，因此由低廉物價政策所引起生產之　礙，業已解決。以固定物價政策爲基礎之經濟封鎖政策，決定除軍需以外，均予取消。同時，封鎖政策時代之物質搬運之不圓滑，亦予緩和，過去內河航運之開放，即爲一具體之表現，同時，陸上運輸早晚亦將由華方自行辦理，而排除一切統制，其影響所及，殊　淺鮮。</p>
<p>絕對把握重要產業　對重要產業之把握，日方旣著重遂行戰事，共在必要最小限度上，强力把握各重要產業之傾向，最近極爲皺著，即凡鐵煤斤，鐵道等與完成戰爭直接有關者，日方均在軍方支援下，予以把捏，所謂把握云者，並非軍管理之意，而係由中日雙方打成一片，開發　業之謂，即以同生共死之精神為出發點，雙方利益同沾，預料此種經濟方策，最近必將被中國方面所認識並無排除華方參加之意也。</p>
<p>統制收買方法改善　　限委讓華方，除與完成戰爭所必要之最小限度之重點產業以外，一切均委交華方經營，而期待華方作積極之活動，此事已被再度確認，例如過去食糧，棉花，植物性　類等之收買，係實行日本式之統制方法，而僅要求華方之協助，頗多漠視華方經濟特有傳統之處，今則決定改良此種方法，由政委會負責收買。此對於過去之弊端將加以緩和，米糧最高統制顯會，米糧協會已予解散，而重新出發。至於油類及雜糧等，亦將採取同樣方法，則其效果不僅在經濟方面，即在政治方面，亦殊堪期待。</p>
<p>指導機關一體活動　當地指導機說之一體化，自當前情勢日趨緊迫之後，各方均要求推進施策，當局之一體活動，因軍方大使館等日方當地機關之一體化，逐步予以推進，在組織法上，謀軍方與大東亞省駐華北各地機關之一體化，係日本中央問題，因爲情形之復雜，似難從速實行，然問題並非在機構之一元化，厥在事實上各機關之一體活動，藉以推進施策之一元化，此為日方實施對華經濟政策必然措置。</p>
<p>綜上所述，華北經濟施策之莫大轉換，已至實　階段，而在影響日方戰力上，華北所負之使命更爲鉅大。在中日滿綜合開發計劃之下，樹立華北徑濟施策，從速予以實施，亦爲當前之急務也。</p>

<p>華南某某基地十四日中央社電　渝府現雖仍照例宣傳」總反攻時期業已到來」，然吾人由渝方報紙及各情報詳加觀察時，則可斷言渝政權尚未到達自主總反攻地位。渝方之張發　所領第四戰區軍，於南寗方面之　動，　恩伯所　滇桂湘邊區軍，於桂柳地區之企圖反攻，以及美式新六軍，於湖南省北部　結等，雖係積極行動，然此等軍隊現仍避免日大陸軍正面攻擊，採取消極增强兵力政策，現僅步入配備兵力準備總反攻而已。又據最近情報傳稱，自本年三月迄六月間，屢傳改編美國式軍隊之二十師重慶軍，大致似均已改編完成，然尚無自主反攻之能力，由是觀察，貴州·湖南·廣西一帶，渝軍之行動，與其稱爲反攻，毋寗稱爲對美軍表示好感，間接鼓勵美軍展開火陸登陸作戰。現渝方雖極自信實力，然尚無以二三十師美式裝備軍突破大陸鐵壁之”軍自信，故其對日反攻，若無美軍掩護，絕不可能，此點乃渝總反攻之最大弱點，而美軍所期待渝府者，乃渝方之大量人力資源，蓋美軍於太平洋作戰時，蒙極大人力損害，故欲展開大陸決戰時，當使重慶代替美國而犧牲。又傳謂，韋特曼繼史蒂維爾對渝合作後，近日對渝關係益形緊密，今後韋特曼交涉之美渝關係，將如何展開，殊堪吾人往目。</p>

<p>廣州十四中央社電據最近情報傳　，延安四月下句之七全大會中，會對渝方表明不辭武力門爭之決意，於是兩方之衝災乃瀕於　大危機，重慶言論界對於渝延關係前途頗為重視，渝方報紙會　出下列諸點。　渝延關係確已邁入正面衝突，然雙方均未拋棄成見，有尋求妥協之意。　兩者均認識，一方抗戰，一方內戰，爲絕對不利之事。　渝延之所離，難以阻止誘發兩軍之全面衝突。　因國際情勢之激　，兩者雖未得確定根本方針，然兩者均有追隨時勢之可能性。結論則謂，揆諸刻下之情勢，兩奢實不應開始武力鬥爭，幷謂抗戰對象之日本軍駐獎大陸之期間內，不容發生內戰，然兩者均利用背後之勢力（美蘇），因之，其糾紛亦必追隨國際情勢之推移而進展。當彼等以夷制夷政策發生破綻之前，正式之武力門爭</p>

<h3 id="c19">英美對蘇政策的檢討　歐洲形勢的演變 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>德國屈服以後，歐洲的政治情勢大變，試加分析，則可看出已發生兩個問題。其一，克里米亞會談中，英美蘇三國間所決定的各種事項，尚未實現。其二，克里米亞會談中，對於德國的新政治形態，米見有任何決定</p>
<p>關於第一點，首先須舉出來的，便是波蘭問題。例如逮捕波蘭要人等事，已使波蘭問題更形複雜，而蘇聯之欲赤化波蘭，亦彰彰明甚。此外，蘇聯未與英美商談而單獨促成奧國新民主主義政府的建立，亦屬問題之一。再則，蒂托與義大利戰綫聯合軍司令亞歷山大間，爲了佔領特里斯德問題，發生組　，此事也同樣表明英美蘇三國的意見，顯有涇渭之分。</p>
<p>關於該問題，美國務副　格魯會謂：「領土的愛更，非最初侵入的佔領奢所可擅定，須待和平會議時，容納民衃的希望，然後予以決定。」由此間接表明美方的不滿。而且，據克里米亞會談決定，奧國的格拉斯地方，本預定作爲美軍佔領區，但今日亦爲蘇軍所佔領。以上各項問題，表明克時米亞會談時三國決定的分界綫及政治解決方策，並未依照約定而實現</p>
<p>三國勢力圈的鬥爭</p>
<p>而且，蘇聯意欲執掌自波羅的海經丹麥而出北海的交通綫，也是次第表面化的新問題。上列各項問題，倘若視之爲劃分歐洲勢力圈的一種表現，則三國關於德國地區的紛爭，豈非行將招致想像以上的混亂嗎？</p>
<p>佔領德國以後，由於蘇聯及英美法政策的各異，今後德國將向何種政治形態發展，英國各報的論調，一致表示憂慮。寒晤士報以下各報，異口同聲指出今日的佔領方式，有發生兩種政治形態互相對立之懼，所以反對分割務國，力主樹立一元的統合政治體制。然而，在這塲合下，對於德國將來的政治形態，英國不像蘇聯，並無什麼具體的政策。</p>
<p>史丹林慶祝征服德國時，曾經宣多：「　聯因德軍的侵略。受到莫大的損失，但蘇聯不想減亡德國國民，也無　除德國之意。」這句話當然使英美兩國相顧失色。因此，他們不免疑神疑鬼，懷疑史丹林有向德國推進蘇聯單方面政策的意圖。隨時準備再起戰爭在這切迫的情勢之前，英國「經濟界」雜誌主張：英國必須改變對蘇政策。其論調如次：</p>
<p>「西歐民主主義國家。恐怕終必遭遇這樣的事實，即：蘇聯將採用無異於過去納粹德國的外交政策。因此，西歐各國應取的唯一政策，就是常時枕戈以待，如在戰時一樣。英國的對務政策，在某一點上，必有很大的謬誤，否則，波蘭奧國等問題，亦不致於嚴重如此。聯合國方面的政策，雖已實行很大的讓步，但都是犧牲他國的讓步，至於有關本國立塲的，則一步不讓。取得蘇聯信賴之道，恐怕除出採用蘇聯的方式，承納蘇聯辛辣的交易以外，別無他途。最難的問題是：德國的政治形態如何？我們主張在德國設置普通行政機關。否則，如果一日不置普通行政機關來代替軍政，則糾紛的種子也一日不絕。蘇隊已在準備樹立自由德意志政權，但對蘇聯這種腹稿，我們也有佔先的辦法。倘若我們對於四·五百萬德軍俘虜，以及畏　蘇軍而由德國東部逃來的許多德國民衃，單獨主持糧食配給，並謀交通機關的恢復原狀，給人們種種便利，收不可以懷柔德國國民。在變蘇聯稍遜英美一籌之間，我們應表明將在德國做些什麼事。而改變對蘇外交戰術。」</p>
<p>與此「經濟界」雜誌的評論相若，美國國內盼望改　對蘇政策的呼聲，也相當高昂。美國外國經　濟院總裁里奧·克洛里，曾於十三日宣稱：「與歐戰告終同時，租軍計劃有再加檢討的必要。目下雖然已在　　中，但在獲得定案以前，希望阻止運輸新的租軍物資赴歐；凡運入歐洲的租軍武器，應以現與日本交戰的　家為限。」弦外之音，顯在要求停止將軍火租貸蘇聯。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的警告</p>
<p>最能淸楚表現歐洲現况者，當准邱吉爾十二日的演說。在他的演說中，有兩個重點。其一是回顧這次的歐戰經過，其二即為　隱約約的　告民衃，叫他們對於蘇聯的動靜，　予警惕·邱吉爾在其演說中暗示前途孕育不提。他說：</p>
<p>「我們的前途，還有許多　難工作。將這點警告國民，是我的責任。英國的參加戰爭，在於維護偉大的理想，在歐洲大陸上，今日自然不能漠視此種理想。我們務須保持自由與民主全義解放所含的眞正意義。倘若任其歪曲，怠於復歸正道，則處罸納率一舉，也毫無意義可言。尚若再有其他「警察政治」代德軍南昌起，那未我們為何而戰，亦屬不能理解。目下在舊金山會議組立中的國際機構，必須貝。」</p>
<p>邱吉爾的警告及「經濟界」的營鐘，實足說明今日歐洲的政治性質。合縱運　之術，與戰爭結束同時　出破綻，乃是史上通例。在民主主義與「警察政治」之間，邱吉爾雖已明立區別，但蘇聯却對之默然。未來的英美蘇三頭會議，關於種咱糾紛的處理，究能獲得何種程度的妥協，目前　從測知，但據美國務副卿格魯的聲明，目下成爲懸案的國境問題，約達三十件之多。這此池然不是一朝一夕所能輕易解決的。這些問題，或可達到某種程度的諒解，但關於德國將來的政治機構，相信三者間是不會成立諒解的。然則，如此說來。英美辦之間，豈非有惹起戰爭的危險嗎？不過，蘇聯的軍事力量固已顯然擴大，但在這次大戰中所受損害亦巨，所以不致與美國發生戰爭。然而，環繞歐洲的政治鬥爭，那是一定日趨劇烈的。（瑞士京城十八日特電）（譯自五月二十日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>關於刑事被告應否　押或交保，在刑事訴訟法，早有規定，但並無單行辦法可資遵守。以過去情形而論，交保係由推事檢察官酌量辦理，因無確切標準，不免引起外界誤會。且現時看守所覊押人犯，日益增多，倘有可予交保情形，而反予覊押，徒使看守所押犯過分擁擠，對於益所衛生改善及目前最嚴重之囚糧問題，均有莫大影響。司法行政部吾部長有鑒於此，特令飭該部刑事司擬定戰時覊押刑事被告暫行辦法五條，呈行政院備案，以部令公布施行。記者茲從本埠法院方面探悉，該項辦法要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）　事設告犯左列各罪者，以覊押爲原則</p>
<p>犯內亂，外患，凟職，殺人，傷害人致死，或致重傷，擄人勒贖，强盜，强姦，放火，決水等罪者。</p>
<p>犯刑法第二百五十六條第二百五十七條及第二百五十九條之罪。</p>
<p>累犯竊盜，搶奪，詐欺，恐嚇，贓物等罪，或以犯竊盜，搶奪，詐欺，　物等罪爲常業者。</p>
<p>犯最輕本刑爲五年以上有期從刑之罪者。</p>
<p>（二）除前條所列者外，其餘刑事彼告，一律以交保爲原則，但左列各被告，應予交保，不得覊押。</p>
<p>犯最重本刑爲三年以下有期徒刑拘役，或專枓罰金之罪者。</p>
<p>懷胎七月以上，或生產後未滿一月者。</p>
<p>現罹疾病經醫師證明，如經覊押，恐有生命危險者。</p>
<p>諭知一年以下有期徒刑拘役或罰金者。</p>
<p>（三）原則上應予覊押之被告，而有交保之必要時，及原則上應予交保之被告，而有覊押之必要時，均須簽叙理由，送由該管長官核定。交保與裁定停止覊押，從此已有準則可資遵守。檢察署及法院方面，自可依此準則切實辦理，社會方而亦可知所適從。又聞關於在所病犯，吳部長特別注意，除　募上海監所改善衛生基金二千餘萬元，組織委員會積極進行外，近派王祖同醫師每日蒞所診騐病犯，以憑決定應否交保。</p>

<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部桑原部長，昨日下午接見新聞記者，關於太平洋英國艦隊之新企圖，及美國太平洋空軍之實力等，　　各　問題發表談話如左：</p>
<p>英艦企圖</p>
<p>（問）英國太平洋艦隊最近有何新企圖？</p>
<p>（答）最近聞有若干英艦開向日本本土周圍及冲繩一帶。初英國在歐洲作戰期中，無力顧到太平　方面，現在因最後發言權關係，爲補救計乃還派艦隊東來。另一原因爲美國海上艦隊已受到極大損失，實力不濟，爲强化太平洋海上力量計，不得不利用英國艦隊，不但在太平洋上如此，將來如大陛作戰，中國方面亦將有英人參加。重慶方面現在有美國空軍，將來英國亦可有空軍駐華。蓋英人不願美國獨　中國之軍事政治及經濟也。英國不願犧牲於初，但亦不肯放棄權利於最後。故共最大目的實爲其本身之權利與發言　而已。</p>
<p>美空軍力</p>
<p>（問）目下美國太平洋方面之空軍實力如何？</p>
<p>（答）太平洋方面美空軍力量之支現大　如下：明多羅爲第五航空隊，呂宋島第十三轟炸隊，中國重慶第十四航空隊，馬利亞納島第二十戰鬥隊，此地之戰略部隊似較有力量，約有B29型機一千架以上，共計約共飛織四千五百架，除上述者外，冲繩海上，尚有其他航空隊，及海軍機動隊等。</p>
<p>厭戰情緒</p>
<p>（問）美國內情形及人民之厭戰情緒如何？</p>
<p>（答）歐洲戰局吿一段落後，一般美國人民多以爲歐洲方面可暫吿無事農務部十二日公布，今年度主要食糧之一般配給，較去年減少百分之五，至百分之七，肉類去年生產量爲二四，六〇〇萬磅，今年減少百分之九，計二一，一六〇萬磅，其中百分之六十係美國軍隊用，食料用油去量爲八十億磅，今年減少百分之十。汕脂較去年減少百分之十三，故一般配給減少百分之十七至廿一，白砂糖較去年減產六十萬噸，今後之配給量勢將逐步紙減，美國人民向以自由侈用開，食糧配給一再減少，其厭戰情緒，自亦日增矣。</p>
<p>死傷統計</p>
<p>（問）冲繩作戰美軍之損失，約佔其總數幾成？</p>
<p>（答）自敵軍向冲繩登陸以來美軍共動用八個師團，每一師團一五〇〇〇人，總數爲十二萬人，其死傷約爲十二分之七，即佔總數一半以上，其海上總隊大小盤船約共一千四百艘，被擊沉破者五六六艘，人員死傷數未祥，六艘，人員死傷數未詳，但根據美方發表，以擊沉一艘百人中死七五人，擊破一艘百人中死五〇人之比例類推，則其損失總數約爲三十二萬人，又根據美方發表之數字，海上損失數，校陸地上爲鉅。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Swift Implementation of Emergency Measures Law Expected to Adjust and Solidify Wartime System; Japanese Prime Minister Meets with Reporters to Elaborate on Determination <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki met with a group of reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence at 11:00 AM on the 14th (for about an hour). He answered their questions, expressing the government's beliefs and unwavering determination to prosecute the war under the pressing circumstances of the impending decisive battle on the homeland. Prime Minister Suzuki elaborated on his determination as follows:</p>
<p>"At this stage of the war, the Okinawa battle, I believe, is not the final decisive battle. The war situation will continue to evolve. Even if a decisive battle unfolds on the homeland, if the entire nation can raise their spirits to diminish the enemy's will and demonstrate courage, even though the enemy boasts abundant materiel, their will to fight will ultimately be frustrated.</p>
<p>"I, bearing the weight of the nation's security and survival, am determined to dedicate myself to protecting the national polity as I vowed when forming the cabinet, and with this resolve, break through the stalemate.</p>
<p>"The synchronization and coordination of state affairs and command have been perfected through the close operation of the current Imperial General Headquarters conferences and the Supreme War Leadership Conferences. In particular, the Supreme War Leadership Conference functions as a wartime cabinet, fully integrating state affairs and command into a unified whole.</p>
<p>"Raising the morale of the nation is crucial for the war effort. Even if the enemy attempts a landing operation on the homeland, the military and civilians must unite as one, destroying the enemy at sea, annihilating them on the coast, and utterly defeating any landing forces on land. Furthermore, the enemy's supply lines would be extremely difficult during a landing operation. They cannot mobilize a million troops at once, and even if they land tens of thousands, it would take months. Therefore, the enemy must make considerable preparations. During the European war, the Axis powers landed a large army on the coast of northern France, but that was only across a strait. The journey from the United States to Japan is a truly long distance, and we are fully prepared for it.</p>
<p>"To implement wartime emergency measures, we have requested the invocation of the Emperor's prerogative under Article 3 of the Constitution. The Wartime Emergency Measures Law, though still under deliberation, has been urgently submitted to the Diet due to the urgency of the ongoing battles following Okinawa. This is what the government and the people jointly desire. In the future, the application of this law must be swift, adjusting the decisive battle system and achieving its intended effect.</p>
<p>"Due to the victories at the beginning of the war, the people were filled with optimism about the Greater East Asia War. Now, as the war situation evolves, the entire nation is sincerely concerned for the country, resolved to die for it, and supporting the national polity. This is truly gratifying."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Decisive Battle on Tarakan Island Enters Final Stage; Japanese Forces in the Philippines Achieve Great Victory <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Southern Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - The battle on Tarakan Island, which began with the enemy's assault on the Kyuda Battery, has seen fierce hand-to-hand combat centered on Hill 102 in recent days. The brave soldiers of the Japanese garrison have fought courageously, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, who have fled in disarray without even collecting their dead. On the 9th and 10th, Japanese bomber squadrons launched fierce raids on the enemy positions, greatly boosting the morale of the garrison troops, thus entering the final stage of the decisive battle. The entire Japanese force immediately launched a general assault against the enemy's front lines, engaging in desperate melee combat. The Tarakan garrison, with its small force, has bravely resisted a superior enemy, causing them heavy casualties. The fierce fighting has continued for over forty days, and the valiant Japanese troops are still fighting bravely.</p>
<p>Southern Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison on Tarakan Island is putting up a stubborn resistance. The enemy is employing small aircraft to bomb and burn the dense forests, attempting to break through the Japanese lines. In response, the Japanese air and land forces launched a coordinated general offensive at 3:00 AM on the 10th, causing enemy camps and supply depots to explode and catch fire. Japanese commando teams, who had infiltrated the enemy lines beforehand, joined in the attack, focusing their fire and striking hard. The enemy suffered heavy losses and has fallen into great confusion.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the Palete-Sanlak-Raglak front, Japanese and American forces have been engaged in fierce fighting for three months, and the situation has now reached a critical stage. The closest the two armies are is only thirty to fifty meters. And both armies are mobilizing all their weapons, and repeatedly launched a desperate defense against each other. During this time, the Japanese army repeatedly used suicide melee attacks, and severely damaged the enemy. Since mid-March, when the enemy began attacking the Japanese army, the enemy's losses have been approximately 20,000 people. The Japanese army is still ensuring the front, however the front has been messed up more and more. The enemy is currently advancing with a superior artillery and an absolutely superior air power. Amongst the enemy's first line, there are soldiers mixed with the local indigenous army, approximately 2,000 in front of Palete, and the army in front of Sanlak-Sek. The Japanese army fights with their best skill, killing enemies, and received great victories, and are currently waiting to prepare to launch the final battle. According to what a staff officer coming from the first line said: This decisive battle, could be said to be to the advantage of the Japanese forces. From various point of views, enemy operations can not be optimistic. Palete-Rakik enemy forces, is still the same division from when they attacked first. The Palete side is the 25th division, and the Sanlak-Sek side is the 23rd division, with no large forces. And After the Japanese army's continuous melee attacks, the fighting strength has decreased to 1/3 of its former strength. So, the enemy is using indigenous forces to fill in the gaps. Also, for the enemy's purpose of supplementing fighting strength's consumption, they made planes and artillery to increase the amount of bullets fired, in order to make up for that part of lack. In recent days, the enemy military, because of rain and other reasons, and plane cooperation suffered large impact. The artillery ammo delivery, is also extremely difficult. On the contrary, the Japanese military's morale is unusually high, and are currently waiting for the opportunity to kill the enemy.</p>

<p>— Chen Yaoxi</p>
<p>On the Issue of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province through Variety Improvement and Promotion of Superior Strains</p>
<p>Mr. Ando Hirotaro pointed out in his article "Problems of Rice Cultivation" that Japan's rice production has approximately doubled in the past fifty years, which is to say that the average annual yield has increased by more than one percent for a given area. The main reason for this is the improvement and promotion of varieties. The Jiangsu province's important food crops, their variety of systems is extremely complex. If you take only rice varieties, there is the Hsien, Geng, and Nuo three types of early, middle and late planting species. Other than species with different physical properties but the same name or same physical properties but a different name. There are at least over 1,200 types. These many types are scattered among locations. The farmers planting in those areas are not aware of the matters of choosing breeds or harvesting seeds, and they lack breeding knowledge. Thus, among these there are excellent species, and also very poor species.</p>
<p>After the Incident (Second Sino-Japanese War), due to environment and economic changes, the average rice yield per mu has varied greatly. According to statistics from February of the thirty-second year (1943), the Suzhou area's central six counties' cooperative union crop yield evaluation society recorded the following: among the 200 rice varieties contributed by Wu County, Wu Jiang, Yuanshi, Kunshan, Changzhou, and Dangshu, the highest yield was 3.89 shi per mu, and the lowest yield was 1.22 shi per mu. This translates to a ratio of 1 to 3.19, a shocking difference. The collection of the full results is such that 1/10th of rice yielded greater than 3 shi per mu, and that 2/10th of rice yielded less than 3 shi per mu. The rest yielded between 2 and 3 shi. These are the results provided by the richest six counties of the Jiangsu province for this evaluation association. One can assume the actual rice yields from the other counties will be even lower, suggesting that there is a significant need for improvement.</p>
<p>Before the Incident, Jiangsu Province focused most of its efforts on breeding in order to improve rice farming. The species produced by pure-line breeding methods include the #324, #318, and #348 Geng rice varieties from the Jiangsu Provincial Rice Experiment Station, as well as the #298 and #304 awnless late Geng rice. Also the Zhegeng Qingdao rice and Bazidao rice varieties from the Songjiang branch station, the Hongke Xiandao rice from the Gaoyou branch station, and the #1386, #287, and #1659 Xiandao rice from Jinling University. The 80 Zi rice, Jiangning Yangxian rice, and Maozitou rice from National Central University. All of these had very large achievements in promotion and cultivation. However, if previous variety breeding methods are used within current circumstances, then there are three points that should be noted:</p>
<p>Although pure-line and hybrid breeding methods are the most basic, reasonable, and scientific methods of variety improvement, these methods take a long time and are very costly. At a time when China's economy is tight and there is an urgent need to increase food production, we should use the most economical methods and the shortest amount of time to obtain the greatest results.</p>
<p>In the past, the materials used for breeding were selected from single ears of rice in various places for experimentation. The locations for selection were haphazard, and the species selected were only a fraction of the farmers' types. It was not easy to find truly superior species in various places. Even if one was lucky enough to find them, they could not be widely promoted and beneficial to farmers due to differences in adaptability.</p>
<p>Agriculture has regional, climatic, and temporal characteristics. A strain that is suitable for place A may not be suitable for place B. Furthermore, China's vast territory, different customs, and different farming systems have a great impact on the selection of crops. Therefore, those engaged in improvement work should recognize that the local original varieties have a considerable value as pure lines and deal with them accordingly.</p>
<p>In summary, in addition to implementing pure-line or hybrid breeding methods, a comprehensive variety comparison method should be actively implemented. All types of local species should be collected and tested to eliminate inferior species and raise the status of superior species, so that local varieties tend to be absolutely pure, and then actively promoted, so that local production can have better progress. The first step of implementation, testing, began in Hunan Province in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), and the method is as follows:</p>
<p>The entire province is divided into several large regions, with one county as a unit, four or five counties as a small region, and four or five small regions as a large region.</p>
<p>In the first year, all rice varieties in each unit are collected and a comprehensive variety comparison test is carried out in the region.</p>
<p>The superior varieties obtained in the first year are added to the large region for comparison testing in the second year, and are exchanged with each small region for comparative testing.</p>
<p>If a certain strain is proven to be superior by tests in various regions within four years, it is adopted as a pure-line variety for that area for promotion, and the provincial and county local governments and agricultural agencies may advise or force farmers to plant it.</p>
<p>After the war, the provincial government was struggling financially and had no foundation for breeding, but it still worked hard to promote it. For example, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the Jiangsu provincial government followed the Ministry of Food's proposed three-year food production increase plan and promoted the following urgent and affordable items:</p>
<p>Adjustment of agricultural improvement zones in various counties - The organization of lower-level institutions was adjusted, and Nanjing, Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, Wu County, Kunshan, and Changshu were established.</p>
<p>Establishment of rice breeding farms - In order to actively propagate superior strains, three breeding farms have been established, namely Nanjing, Songjiang, and Kunshan, with a total of 360 mu. A special breeding farm was established in Changshu with 40 mu.</p>
<p>Implementation of seed harvesting - The provincial government announced the "Jiangsu Province 32nd Year Rice Seed Harvesting Counties" on October 18th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), including Wu County, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Wujin, Songjiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jinshan, Dachang, and Changshu.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Jiangsu Province's food production is greatly related to breeding. If superior varieties can be widely adopted and the yield per mu can be increased to 3 shi, then Jiangsu Province's rice production can be increased by half compared to the present, in other words, an annual increase of more than 10 million shi, providing food for 5 million more people. Therefore, Jiangsu Province's use of variety improvement and promotion of superior strains to increase food production has a promising future. (End)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e7">Reaffirming the Proposal to Evacuate Schools <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>In view of the recent serious situation and the problem of price inflation, the issue of population evacuation in this city should be actively pursued. The evacuation committee's original evacuation plan was to first evacuate various charitable organizations. The second step would be schools, especially secondary schools, vocational schools, and especially universities, which urgently need to find a way to implement evacuation quickly.</p>
<p>In our editorial on February 20th of this year, we already raised the issue of school evacuation. Afterwards, due to the problems of evacuation sites and evacuation transportation, which required active planning by various parties, the matter was delayed. Now, there are locations at Dongting and Xishan suitable to be evacuation sites. The location's environment is very good and is especially suitable for setting up schools. The transportation problems can be taken care of by the evacuation committee, transportation side. Therefore, regarding the school evacuation matter, there is the need to repeat the proposal.</p>
<p>The Evacuation of secondary and vocational schools, from a purely educational position, is without special causes such as the current situation and commodity prices etc., that there is a need for consideration. Firstly, in recent decades, Chinese culture and education has formed the imbalanced phenomenon of concentration of talent in the largest cities, and is the main reason for the culture of areas not being able to develop at a balanced rate. Therefore, in the future, there is a need for the nation's educational plan to evenly weigh and emphasize the city and rural areas, and especially pay attention to the development of education equal to and greater than vocational schools in rural areas. Secondly, high schools concentrated in large urban areas, especially a city such as Shanghai, it is harmful and not helpful to the education of the average student. Rural children are simple and honest in character. And upon stepping foot into Shanghai, a city of luxury and extravagance, as a result of what they have heard and witnessed, that they receive harmful habits even before they receive an education. And this is not good for the sake of nation and society's need to nurture talents.</p>
<p>On the other hand, schools in Shanghai evacuating to rural areas, that has the following profits. 1st, that the environment of the rural is clean and simple, which makes the youth studying there be less subject to temptation and distraction, making the education more easily have success. 2nd, if youth students get close to the rural areas, they may get a deeper understanding of rural society, and by that know the difficulties in farming and know the hardships of farmers. In the future, the transformation of China will depend on transformation of the rural being the fundamental issue. So if highschool and university students are familiar with the countryside, it would greatly assist the construction of China. 3rd, Advanced schools get close to rural areas, and can bring modern ideologies and scientific matters into the cultural backward rural areas, so that their cultural level and national and social ideas are gradually raised. They will break superstitions, traditional habits, and promote construction and agricultural improvement movements, in order to make great contributions.</p>
<p>The summer break is coming soon. We hope that the authorities in education and in each school will consider and implement the issue of evacuation. We especially hope that the university authorities can consider together and evacuate together. By establishing a federation of universities, on one hand they can work in specialized areas, and conserve talent, money, and resources. At the same time, for talents such as professors, it is possible to reduce the suffering from running around doing other jobs, and because living expenses in the hinterlands are cheaper, they can calmly focus on education. Within this summer break, they should finish all of the preparations and the actual implementation of the work. After the summer break, they will be able to appear in the countryside with a new attitude. The environment of Dongting Xishan is beautiful, and their houses may also be used. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have already expressed that they would give their fullest assistance to the evacuation.</p>
<p>In addition to the joint evacuation of the universities, schools larger than the secondary and vocational schools should also find ways to evacuate as soon as possible. As for the issue of the students after the evacuation, we believe that there is no need to worry about it, because first, if there are schools that have a good reputation, parents would not hesitate to send their children to evacuation sites, and would provide funds so that they can go to school; second, it is cheaper to live in the countryside, which can reduce the burden of the parents; third, the parents can follow their children and evacuate.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the adults and older brothers understand the seriousness of the current situation, and the rising prices, and support the evacuation movement of the schools for the sake of the children's education future, and for the sake of the burden that their kids are carrying.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Economic Measures in North China to Undergo Major Transformation to Adapt to the Current Critical Situation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Economic measures in North China will undergo significant changes to adapt to the current situation. Since the Japanese side implemented its new policy towards China, military-managed factories and various mines will either become Chinese legal entities or be jointly operated by China and Japan. As for pricing policies, a low-price policy will be adopted, and to implement this, a strong economic countermeasure policy will be implemented. In the past, Japanese-style control, which ignored Chinese economic habits and methods of material exchange, had very little effect. In addition, the fundamental policy of entrusting matters to the Chinese side was merely a superficial gesture, and the Chinese side was not actually entrusted with anything. As a result, the ideal of the Japanese side's new policy towards China had the opposite effect, namely, it failed to fully obtain the cooperation of the Chinese side. For this reason, the development of underground and above-ground resources, as well as the maintenance of security, failed to achieve the desired results. Since the end of last year, the military and civilians in North China have reflected on this, and therefore, the economic measures in North China will undergo a major transformation. It is understood that the concept of the Japanese side's new policy towards North China has always been to implement the basic concept of the new policy towards China, that is, to always respect the traditions and characteristics of the Chinese nation, and to fully utilize this point to complete the national revolution that the Chinese people eagerly desire. On the one hand, what the Japanese side wants to do is to concentrate all the powers of economic institutions on the single point of completing the war. On the other hand, the Chinese side is entrusted with the responsibility of autonomous activity. If this point is proven by concrete facts, the trend of economic development in North China can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>Abolishing the Economic Blockade Policy</p>
<p>The idea of stopping economic blockade and the past fixed price policy has been abandoned, and replaced by a policy of stabilizing prices. Therefore, the hindrance to production caused by the low price policy has been resolved. The economic blockade policy based on the fixed price policy has been decided to be cancelled except for military needs. At the same time, the unsmooth movement of materials during the blockade era will also be eased. The opening of inland river transportation in the past is a concrete manifestation of this. At the same time, land transportation will also be handled by the Chinese side sooner or later, and all controls will be eliminated. The impact of this is very significant.</p>
<p>Absolute Grasp of Important Industries</p>
<p>Regarding the grasp of important industries, the Japanese side is focusing on carrying out the war, and the tendency to strongly grasp the important industries to the necessary minimum extent is very obvious recently. That is, all iron ore, coal, railways, etc. that are directly related to the completion of the war are grasped by the Japanese side with the support of the military. The so-called grasp does not mean military management, but rather the joint development of industries by China and Japan, that is, taking the spirit of "shared life and death" as the starting point, and sharing the benefits of both parties. It is expected that this economic strategy will soon be recognized by the Chinese side and there is no intention to exclude the participation of the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Improvement of the Control and Purchase Methods</p>
<p>Except for the key industries that are necessary to complete the war to the minimum extent, everything else is entrusted to the Chinese side for operation, and the Chinese side is expected to take active action. This has been reconfirmed. For example, in the past, the purchase of food, cotton, vegetable oils, etc. was carried out using Japanese-style control methods, and only required the assistance of the Chinese side, which often ignored the unique traditions of the Chinese economy. Now, it has been decided to improve this method, with the Political Affairs Committee responsible for the purchase. This will alleviate the past malpractices. The Supreme Rice Control Association and the Rice Association have been disbanded and restarted. As for oils and miscellaneous grains, the same method will be adopted. The effect of this will be significant not only in the economic aspect but also in the political aspect.</p>
<p>Integrated Activities of Guidance Organizations</p>
<p>With the current situation becoming increasingly critical, all parties are demanding the promotion of policies and the integrated activities of the authorities. The integration of the Japanese local organizations such as the military and the embassy is being gradually promoted. In terms of organizational law, the integration of the military and the Greater East Asia Ministry's organizations in North China is a central issue for Japan. Due to the complexity of the situation, it seems difficult to implement it quickly. However, the issue is not the unification of the organization, but rather the integrated activities of the various organizations in fact, in order to promote the unification of policies. This is an inevitable measure for the Japanese side to implement its economic policy towards China.</p>
<p>In summary, the enormous transformation of economic measures in North China has reached the implementation stage, and North China bears a greater mission in influencing the Japanese side's war power. It is also an urgent task to establish economic measures in North China under the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian integrated development plan and implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Chongqing Has Not Yet Completed Its Independent Counter-Offensive Capability <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>A certain base in South China, 14th (Central News Agency) - Although the Chongqing government is still routinely proclaiming that "the general counter-offensive period has already arrived," when we carefully observe the newspapers and various intelligence reports from Chongqing, we can assert that the Chongqing regime has not yet reached the position of an independent general counter-offensive. Although the troops of the Fourth War Zone led by Zhang Fakui in the Nanning area, the troops in the Yunnan-Guangxi-Hunan border area led by Enber, who are attempting to counter-attack the Guilin-Liuzhou area, and the American-equipped New Sixth Army, which are gathering in the northern part of Hunan Province, are taking active actions, these troops are still avoiding direct attacks from the Japanese mainland army and are adopting a passive policy of increasing troop strength. They are only in the process of deploying troops in preparation for a general counter-offensive. Furthermore, according to recent intelligence reports, it is said that the 20 Chongqing divisions that have repeatedly been reported to be reorganized into American-style troops from March to June of this year have generally been reorganized, but they still do not have the ability to launch an independent counter-offensive. From this observation, the actions of the Chongqing army in the Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi areas should be described not as a counter-offensive, but rather as expressing goodwill towards the US military and indirectly encouraging the US military to launch amphibious landings. Although Chongqing is currently very confident in its strength, it does not have the "military confidence" to break through the continental iron wall with twenty or thirty American-equipped divisions. Therefore, its counter-offensive against Japan is impossible without US military cover. This is the biggest weakness of Chongqing's general counter-offensive. What the US military expects from the Chongqing government is the massive human resources of Chongqing. Because the US military suffered extremely large human losses in the Pacific War, when it launches a continental decisive battle, it will have Chongqing replace the United States in making sacrifices. It is also reported that since Weidman succeeded Stilwell in cooperating with Chongqing, relations with Chongqing have become increasingly close recently. How the US-Chongqing relations negotiated by Weidman will unfold in the future is worthy of our attention.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Council held its 72nd meeting on the 14th. The minutes of the meeting are recorded below: Reporting Items: Reading of the minutes of the 71st meeting. Discussion Items: The chairman submitted for discussion a memorandum from the secretary, approving a letter from the Legislative Yuan to review and amend Article 5, Paragraph 5 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law. After the Legal System Committee reviewed it, it submitted a report on the review results and attached a draft amendment for review. It was submitted to the 116th meeting of the Yuan for discussion. It was agreed that although the Wartime Criminal Special Law was promulgated by the National Government, it had not gone through the legislative process, and the entire text of the law should be submitted for review to comply with legal procedures. A resolution was passed requesting verification and reporting, etc. The Wartime Criminal Special Law was submitted to the 13th meeting of the National Defense Council for a resolution, which was handed over to President Chen Gongbo, Minister Chen Qun, Minister Mei Siping, and Minister Luo Junqiang to be responsible, and experts were convened to review it as soon as possible. The 123rd meeting of the Central Political Committee resolved to approve the review report and send it to the National Government for promulgation and implementation, and to the Legislative Yuan for reference.

<h3 id="e11">Chongqing Intellectual Circles Attach Importance to Chongqing-Yan'an Relations <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to recent intelligence reports, at the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an in late April, the CCP expressed its determination to Chongqing not to rule out armed conflict. As a result, the conflict between the two sides is on the verge of a major crisis. Intellectual circles in Chongqing attach great importance to the future of Chongqing-Yan'an relations. Chongqing newspapers have pointed out the following points: The Chongqing-Yan'an relationship has indeed entered a direct conflict, but both sides have not abandoned their prejudices and have the intention to seek compromise. Both recognize that one side resisting Japan and the other side engaging in civil war is absolutely unfavorable. The separation between Chongqing and Yan'an is difficult to prevent from triggering a full-scale conflict between the two armies. Due to the intensification of the international situation, although the two sides have not determined a fundamental policy, both have the possibility of following the trend of the times. The conclusion is that, judging from the current situation, the two sides should not start an armed struggle, and that civil war should not occur while the Japanese army is stationed on the mainland. However, both sides are using the forces behind them (the United States and the Soviet Union). Therefore, their disputes will inevitably follow the changes in the international situation and progress. Before their policy of using barbarians to control barbarians fails, a formal armed conflict</p>

<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, US President Truman announced at a press conference yesterday that the date and location of the Big Three meeting have been decided by Stalin, Churchill, and himself. However, the date and location of the meeting will not be announced before the meeting begins. He added: "I will attend the meeting with Secretary of State Stettinius and former wartime mobilization ministers Pence, Hopkins, and Davis. Now, the opinions of the three leaders of our United Nations have become consistent, and the situation between the three countries has improved greatly compared to before Hopkins went to Moscow. Hopkins' trip to Moscow has resolved the veto issue that was deadlocked at the San Francisco Conference." Finally, he added: "Chief of Staff Leahy will also attend the meeting, but no journalists will be allowed to participate in the meeting."</p>

If the technical work of translation and transcription cannot be completed by then, the new charter of the conference will be signed in English.</p>
<p>Regulations on Compulsory Measures Passed</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the 12th, the Security Council of the San Francisco Conference passed the regulations on compulsory measures of the Security Council in the International Charter proposed by the Committee on Compulsory Measures, which stipulates the measures taken by the Council against acts of aggression, but does not include the method of decision (the so-called voting procedure), that is, the commonly known restraint, agreement, or force.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Moscow, twelve Polish dignitaries will hold important talks on the Polish government reorganization plan in Moscow on the 15th. Foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will also participate in the meeting. Four representatives of the Warsaw regime arrived in Moscow on the 13th. Moscow seems to be expecting the Polish dignitaries to negotiate with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. If so, the Polish issue may be resolved before the summit. According to a dispatch from London, Sakowski, a socialist representative of the exiled regime who was invited this time, stated on the night of the 13th that he could not attend the meeting due to opposition from the Socialist Party. However, the exiled regime authorities stated that the news of the sixteen leaders who were engaged in secret work was unknown, so it is doubtful whether the exiled regime will happily participate in the Moscow meeting.</p>

The British Air Force, with more than one million personnel, will be reduced by one-third in the coming year, and demobilization is scheduled to begin in mid-June. Consideration will also be given to the war against Japan, so that the proportion of domestic service personnel and overseas service personnel will be maintained at a reasonable ratio. 24% of the personnel in the war against Germany have been deployed overseas, and 4% need to be deployed to the war against Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Review of Anglo-American Policy Towards the Soviet Union and the Evolution of the European Situation <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>After Germany's surrender, the political situation in Europe underwent a significant transformation. An analysis reveals two primary issues. Firstly, the various matters decided upon by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the Yalta Conference have not been fully implemented. Secondly, no decisions regarding the new political structure of Germany were made at the Yalta Conference.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the most prominent issue is the Polish question. The arrest of Polish leaders, for example, has further complicated the matter, and the Soviet Union's desire to communize Poland is increasingly evident. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's unilateral establishment of a new Austrian democratic government without consulting the United Kingdom and the United States is also problematic. Moreover, the discord between Tito and General Alexander, commander of the Allied forces in the Italian theater, over the occupation of Trieste, similarly demonstrates a clear divergence of opinions among the three powers.</p>
<p>Concerning this issue, U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew stated, "The adjustment of territories should not be arbitrarily decided by the initial occupying forces. The wishes of the people must be considered and decisions made at a peace conference." This indirectly expresses American dissatisfaction. Moreover, according to the Yalta agreement, Graz, Austria, was intended to be an American occupation zone, but it is currently occupied by Soviet forces. The issues above demonstrate that the demarcation lines and political solutions agreed upon at the Yalta Conference have not been implemented as agreed.</p>
<p>The Struggle for Spheres of Influence Among the Three Powers</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Soviet Union's intention to control the communication lines from the Baltic Sea through Denmark to the North Sea is a newly emerging problem. If these issues are seen as a manifestation of the division of European spheres of influence, will the disputes among the three powers over Germany not lead to chaos beyond imagination?</p>
<p>Since the occupation of Germany, the differing policies of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France have raised concerns among British newspapers about the future political structure of Germany. Newspapers such as The Times unanimously point out that the current occupation method risks the emergence of two opposing political entities, thus opposing the division of Germany and advocating for a unified political system. However, in this context, the United Kingdom, unlike the Soviet Union, does not have a concrete policy regarding the future political structure of Germany.</p>
<p>When Stalin celebrated the conquest of Germany, he declared, "The Soviet Union suffered tremendous losses due to the German invasion, but the Soviet Union does not want to destroy the German people, nor does it intend to eliminate Germany." This statement understandably alarmed the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, they cannot help but be suspicious, suspecting that Stalin intends to advance a unilateral Soviet policy towards Germany. Facing this pressing situation of potential renewed conflict, The Economist magazine argued that the United Kingdom must change its policy towards the Soviet Union. Its argument is as follows:</p>
<p>"Western European democracies will likely face the reality that the Soviet Union will adopt a foreign policy no different from that of Nazi Germany in the past. Therefore, the only policy that Western European countries should adopt is to be constantly prepared for war, as if in wartime. There must be a significant error in the UK's policy towards the Soviet Union, otherwise, issues like Poland and Austria would not be so serious. The United Nations' policy has made significant concessions, but all of these concessions are at the expense of other countries, while no ground is given regarding the UK's own position. The only way to gain the Soviet Union's trust is to adopt the Soviet Union's methods and accept its harsh bargains. The most difficult question is: What will the political structure of Germany be like? We advocate for the establishment of ordinary administrative agencies in Germany. Otherwise, if a common administrative agency is not established to replace the military administration, the seeds of conflict will never be eliminated. The Soviet forces are already preparing to establish a free German regime, but we also have a way to preempt the Soviet Union's plan. If we independently administer food distribution to the four to five million German prisoners of war and the many German people fleeing from eastern Germany to avoid the Soviet forces, and seek to restore the transportation system, providing people with various conveniences, we can undoubtedly win over the German people. While remaining slightly inferior to the Soviet Union, we should demonstrate what we will do in Germany and change our diplomatic tactics towards the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Similar to The Economist's commentary, there is also a considerable outcry in the United States for changing the policy towards the Soviet Union. Leo Crowley, director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration, stated on the 13th, "With the end of the European war, there is a need to re-examine the lend-lease program. Although it is currently underway, we hope to prevent the transportation of new lend-lease materials to Europe until a final decision is reached; the Lend-Lease weapons transported to Europe should be limited to countries currently at war with Japan." The implication is clear: to demand the cessation of the lend-lease of military supplies to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Churchill's Warning</p>
<p>The most clear expression of the current situation in Europe can be found in Churchill's speech on the 12th. In his speech, there were two key points. One was to review the course of the European war, and the other was to implicitly warn the people to be vigilant about the Soviet Union's movements. Churchill hinted that the future was fraught with uncertainty in his speech, saying:</p>
<p>"Our future holds many difficult tasks. It is my responsibility to warn the nation of this. The UK's participation in the war was to uphold great ideals. Today, we must not disregard these ideals on the European continent. We must maintain the true meaning of the liberation of freedom and democracy. If we allow it to be distorted and fail to return to the right path, then the punishment of the Nazis would be meaningless. If another 'police state' replaces the German military, then it is incomprehensible why we fought. The international organization currently being established at the San Francisco Conference must..."</p>
<p>Churchill's warning and The Economist's alarm bell effectively illustrate the current political nature of Europe. The breakdown of alliances at the end of the war is a common occurrence in history. Churchill has clearly distinguished between democracy and "police politics," but the Soviet Union remains silent on the matter. To what extent the future Anglo-American-Soviet summit will achieve compromise on various disputes is currently impossible to predict, but according to U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew, there are currently about thirty border disputes outstanding. These certainly cannot be easily resolved overnight. These problems may reach some degree of understanding, but it is believed that the three parties will not reach an understanding regarding the future political structure of Germany. Then, does this mean that there is a danger of war between the United Kingdom and the United States? However, while the Soviet Union's military strength has clearly increased, it has also suffered enormous damage in this war, so it is unlikely to go to war with the United States. However, the political struggle surrounding Europe is certain to intensify. (Special dispatch from the Swiss capital, 18th) (Translated from the May 20th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Municipal Finance Bureau Levies Real Estate Deed Tax; Notification Sent to Banking and Trust Associations for Compliance <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau states that, within the former British and French concessions of this city, the real estate ownership of various businesses and residents is based on the land deeds issued by the former concession authorities and the title deeds held by foreign merchants. Since the municipal government has taken back the concessions and unified municipal administration, the transfer of such real estate by citizens should be handled in accordance with regulations at the competent municipal authorities to ensure legal property rights. However, most citizens often engage in private transfers, failing to declare and pay taxes. Moreover, deeds involving larger areas or more houses cannot be readily divided and transferred. Furthermore, banks or trust companies issue so-called land management certificates. New and old owners can thus collect and manage properties separately, completely dissociating themselves from the government, not to mention registering deeds and paying taxes. To rectify tax collection and protect people's property rights, a deed tax will be levied on real estate managed by banks or trust companies starting in May of this year. If businesses or residents use land management certificates issued by banks or trust companies to buy, sell, or transfer real estate, they must register the deed, transfer ownership, and pay the deed tax in accordance with regulations at the Finance Bureau. For all businesses or residents whose real estate is managed by banks or trust companies prior to May, the banks and companies should submit a list to the Finance Bureau, including the names, addresses, and locations and areas of the real estate, for verification. Subsequently, the Finance Bureau will issue deeds and collect taxes based on the land management certificates of the respective banks and companies, which will bear full guarantee responsibility. The above measures have been approved by the municipal government. It is reported that the Finance Bureau has sent notifications to the Shanghai Banking Association and the Trust Companies Association, instructing them to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Temporary Measures for Detention of Criminal Defendants; Minister Wu Orders Drafting <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Criminal Procedure Law already stipulates whether criminal defendants should be detained or released on bail, but there are no separate measures to be followed. In the past, bail was handled at the discretion of judges and prosecutors, but the lack of clear standards inevitably caused misunderstandings. Furthermore, the number of detainees in detention centers is increasing daily. Detaining those who could be released on bail only makes the detention centers more crowded, which has a great impact on improving hygiene and addressing the current serious issue of prisoner rations. In light of this, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Judicial Administration has ordered the Criminal Division of the Ministry to draft five temporary measures for the detention of criminal defendants during wartime and submit them to the Executive Yuan for record, to be promulgated and implemented by ministerial order. The reporter learned the following key points of these measures from the local court:</p>
<p>(1) Criminal defendants who commit the following crimes shall be detained in principle:</p>
<p>Those who commit crimes of internal disorder, external aggression, dereliction of duty, murder, causing death or serious injury, kidnapping for ransom, robbery, rape, arson, or flooding.</p>
<p>Those who commit crimes under Articles 256, 257, and 259 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>Repeat offenders of theft, robbery, fraud, intimidation, or receiving stolen goods, or those who habitually commit theft, robbery, fraud, or receiving stolen goods.</p>
<p>Those who commit crimes with a minimum principal sentence of imprisonment of five years or more.</p>
<p>(2) Except for those listed in the preceding article, all other criminal defendants shall be released on bail in principle. However, the following defendants shall be released on bail and shall not be detained:</p>
<p>Those who commit crimes with a maximum principal sentence of imprisonment of three years or less, detention, or a fine only.</p>
<p>Those who are seven months pregnant or more, or less than one month postpartum.</p>
<p>Those who are currently suffering from a disease that a doctor has certified would endanger their life if detained.</p>
<p>Those who are sentenced to imprisonment of one year or less, detention, or a fine.</p>
<p>(3) When it is necessary to release on bail a defendant who should be detained in principle, or when it is necessary to detain a defendant who should be released on bail in principle, the reasons must be stated and submitted to the competent superior for approval. From now on, there will be standards to follow for granting bail and ordering suspension of detention. The prosecutor's office and the court can implement them effectively, and the public will know what to expect. It is also heard that Minister Wu is paying special attention to sick prisoners. In addition to raising more than 20 million yuan for the Shanghai Prison Health Improvement Fund and organizing a committee to actively implement improvements, he has recently dispatched Dr. Wang Zutung to visit the prisons daily to examine sick prisoners in order to determine whether they should be released on bail.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality County Administration Office, in order to understand the actual situation in each county district, has convened an administrative conference of all county districts. The heads of each county district have already reported to the office yesterday (the 14th). It is heard that the conference is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Open-Air Vendors Must Use Anti-Aircraft Lamps <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The city's air defense authorities, in order to strengthen air defense tasks, have implemented regular light control, absolutely prohibiting light leakage to prevent enemy aircraft from attacking. As for open-air vendors, it was initially planned to ban them, but considering the hardships of the people, they are allowed to set up stalls in appropriate locations when preparing for light control at 10:00 PM. However, they must use the anti-aircraft lamps specified by the Air Defense Headquarters, which consist of a square kerosene lamp made of iron, covered with a circular iron lamp shade, so that the light shines downwards. The styles have been distributed to various branches, instructing the vendors to adopt and manufacture them. They must not use other dry cell or other types of lights. At the same time, they are not allowed to operate after the light control warning at 10:00 PM. Violators will be banned.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Money Shops Increase Additional Handling Fees <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Shops Association previously stated that the operating expenses of the members had increased significantly. According to Article 10 of the industry regulations, "Money shops may charge customers handling fees based on the nature of the business." It was proposed to charge an additional handling fee based on the standard of overdue interest, adding 50% to 100% of the monthly overdue interest rate. After deliberation and decision by the Board of Directors and Supervisors, it was immediately notified to all shops for implementation. However, after several months, the expenses of various shops have continued to increase frequently due to price increases. The shops have requested the Association to consider increasing the additional handling fee to provide compensation. The Association has submitted the matter to the Board of Directors and Supervisors for discussion and decision. Starting in June, the additional handling fee will be changed to increase by 100% to 150% of the monthly overdue interest rate. It is heard that this matter has been notified to all shops for compliance.</p>

In order to improve the treatment of police officers, free rice is distributed to each Chinese police officer every month to stabilize their lives. The rice for this month and next month has been prepared and will be distributed by the Police Welfare Association from today (the 15th) to the 19th. Leaders of various departments, bureaus, teams, stations, and institutes are instructed to collect the rice from the Association.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Revised Rules for Regulating Automobiles <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>

<h3 id="e27">Industry Associations Urge Prohibition of Non-Industry Members from Hoarding Goods; Rising Prices Harm Industries <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The main industry associations in this city believe that the recent rise in prices is due to two factors: first, industry insiders manipulating and hoarding, leading to a sharp reduction in the supply of materials; and second, non-industry members illegally purchasing and storing large quantities of goods, while taking advantage of rumors to profit from speculation. If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will not only harm the industries themselves but also directly endanger the livelihood of the people. In view of this, the associations have decided through separate meetings to issue documents to the relevant authorities, urging them to use political power to prohibit non-industry members from purchasing and storing any materials. If hoarding is discovered, the industry association should be notified first to determine whether they are members or non-members before considering appropriate action. It is reported that recently, some citizens have been using their spare funds to buy and sell various major commodities such as cotton cloth, silk, soap, matches, cooking oil, firewood, charcoal, and paper in an attempt to profit from high prices. However, the entire business market suffers as a result. Moreover, they do not open companies or obtain business registration certificates, often privately transferring goods to each other. If such matters are not strictly prohibited, the future of industry and commerce is feared to be bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Stock Exchange Income Tax Changed to a Levy of Six Ten-Thousandths <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited Director Luo of the Shanghai District Collection Bureau regarding the collection of local stock exchange income tax. Director Luo kindly explained the details. A summary is provided below: According to regulations, profits from buying and selling securities are subject to taxation as a temporary business operation, in accordance with Article 12 of the Implementation Rules of the Income Tax Regulations. Due to a sudden increase in the quota for the 34th year, the Bureau drafted collection methods last month and submitted them to the Ministry for approval, originally scheduled to take effect on June 7th. Subsequently, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and brokers, citing excessively high tax rates and cumbersome collection procedures, repeatedly requested a postponement and proposed that the tax be levied at six ten-thousandths of the total transaction amount, in accordance with the transaction tax collection method, to alleviate the hardships of businesses. Considering that the presented concerns involved modifying established procedures, the Bureau could not approve them directly. After signing an opinion, it was forwarded to the Minister for approval, and it was decided to temporarily implement the proposed method from the 15th of this month. This eliminates the need for brokers to calculate net profits on a per-household basis, and customers will only be subject to a six ten-thousandths tax. This demonstrates that the government, despite its difficult financial situation, is still considerate of businesses. However, many in Shanghai may not be fully aware of this tax collection, hence this report. According to income tax rates, securities transactions exceeding 2 million yuan are subject to a 30% tax on the excess amount. Currently, only six ten-thousandths are deducted from the sales amount. This is not only convenient for brokers, but also reduces the burden on customers, who will likely be willing to pay.</p>

Unfortunately, he sustained serious injuries and was taken to the Far Eastern Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the Civil Air Defense Headquarters believes Qian's bravery deserves commendation and will honor him and award him a monetary gift.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival in the old calendar. In addition to banks, money houses, and exchanges closing, most factories, businesses, and shops also followed suit. However, most did not stop external accounts receivable or internal operations, so few workers had a holiday. This year, most industries mainly transacted in cash, and customers with existing relationships rarely made purchases on credit. Preparing funds to repay transactions with industry peers was not a problem. In addition, bad debts have been reduced compared to previous years due to careful preparation by various industries, and they were able to cope comfortably, safely navigating the holiday season.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Director Kuwahara Analyzes Recent War Situation: Heavy Casualties for American Forces in Okinawa Operation <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Director Kuwahara of the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China met with reporters yesterday afternoon and gave a speech on various issues such as the new intentions of the British Pacific Fleet and the strength of the American Pacific Air Force:</p>
<p>British Fleet's Intentions</p>
<p>(Question) What new intentions does the British Pacific Fleet have recently?</p>
<p>(Answer) Recently, I have heard that some British ships have opened up to the surroundings of the Japanese mainland and Okinawa. Initially, during the European war, the United Kingdom was unable to take care of the Pacific, but now, due to the final say, it has sent a fleet to the east to remedy the situation. Another reason is that the American maritime fleet has suffered extreme losses and its strength is insufficient. In order to strengthen the Pacific maritime strength, the British fleet has to be used. Not only is this the case in the Pacific, but the British will also participate in China in future operations. Chongqing now has the American Air Force, and in the future, the United Kingdom will also have an Air Force stationed in China. The British do not want the United States to dominate China's military, political, and economic affairs. The British do not want to sacrifice themselves at the beginning, but they are also unwilling to give up their rights at the end. Therefore, the greatest purpose is its own rights and expression.</p>
<p>Strength of American Air Force</p>
<p>(Question) What is the current strength of the American Air Force in the Pacific?</p>
<p>(Answer) The current support of the American Air Force in the Pacific is as follows: Mindoro is the Fifth Air Force, Luzon Island the Thirteenth Bombardment Team, China Chongqing the Fourteenth Air Force, Mariana Island the Twentieth Combat Team, and the strategic troops in this place seem to be more powerful, with more than 1,000 B29 aircraft, totaling about 4,500 aircraft. In addition to the above, there are other air forces and naval mobile teams on the Okinawa Sea.</p>
<p>Anti-War Sentiment</p>
<p>(Question) What is the situation in the United States and the anti-war sentiment of the people?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the end of the European war, the general American people believed that there was nothing to do in Europe for the time being. The Ministry of Agriculture announced on the 12th that the general allocation of major food this year was reduced by 5% to 7% compared to last year. Meat production last year was 24.6 million pounds, and this year it was reduced by 9% to 21.16 million pounds, of which 60% was used by the US military. The amount of edible oil going to food was 8 billion pounds, and this year it was reduced by 10%. Lard was reduced by 13% compared to last year, so the general allocation was reduced by 17% to 21%. The production of white sugar was reduced by 600,000 tons compared to last year, and the amount of allocation in the future will be gradually reduced. The American people used to be free to use it lavishly, and the food allocation has been reduced again and again, and their anti-war sentiment has also increased.</p>
<p>Casualty Statistics</p>
<p>(Question) What percentage of the total number of American troops were lost in the Okinawa operation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Since the enemy troops landed on Okinawa, the US military has used a total of eight divisions, each division with 15,000 people, totaling 120,000 people. The number of dead and injured is about seven-twelfths, which is more than half of the total number. The total number of large and small ships in the sea team is about 1,400, and the number of sunken and broken ones is 566. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown. However, according to the US announcement, by analogy with the ratio of 75 deaths per 100 people sunk and 50 deaths per 100 people broken, the total number of losses is about 320,000 people. According to the numbers announced by the US, the number of maritime losses is larger than that on land.</p>

<h3 id="e38">This Newspaper's Scholarship Program Will Continue as Usual Next Term <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Office of this newspaper's reader scholarship has recently received letters from poor students from various schools inquiring about how to apply for the next term's scholarship, whether to issue additional scholarships for the three-semester system, and summer school scholarships. This office cannot reply individually, so it is hereby publicly announced as follows: Recently, prices have soared, and people's lives have become more difficult. It is expected that school fees will increase sharply next year, and the burden on students' parents and brothers will be even heavier, that is, students dropping out of school will become a widespread fact. The colleagues of this newspaper are deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times and regard education assistance as their duty; it is their unavoidable duty to relieve those who drop out of school: Therefore, the next education assistance movement is being carefully planned, and once the method is determined, it will be made public to the society to jointly plan the method of relief. It is hoped that all powerful people from all walks of life will generously donate at any time so that the education assistance fund will be increased day by day to achieve success. The gold for this office is issued with two school terms as the standard. For schools that have three school terms, unless the tuition fee is particularly low, the gold issued in the previous term does not meet the maximum limit, and all subsidies will not be provided separately. The request to issue an additional one-semester period cannot be approved. Summer school tuition fees should be raised by each student, and this office will not make arrangements. Regarding the above three matters, it is hoped that the authorities and students of various schools will pay attention and inform all students.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Appeal to Trade Associations to Run More Volunteer Schools <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices are rising on the ground, and children have no books to read, and teachers have no books to teach! Isn't "dropping out of school" and "dropping out of education" the greatest loss to society and the country? Therefore, I sincerely make a request to the municipal industrial and commercial trade associations and appeal to all industrial and commercial trade associations to raise the banner of justice and run more volunteer schools, especially volunteer middle schools, so that young people still have the opportunity to pursue further studies. Industrial and commercial trade associations have more income and sufficient strength. The most meaningful social cause is no more than this. I think the wise men of the industrial and commercial community will never take second place! (Zhongjiao)</p>
