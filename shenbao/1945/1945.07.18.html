<h3>實施決戰各項方策舉總力爭取勝利　日地方總監會議首相致詞</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　鈴木首相於十六日之地方總監會議席上致開會　，力說敵人熾烈猛襲之下，一位國民應信賴統帥部萬全之準備，忍受一切困苦，集合總力，向完遂聖戰途上勇往直進，希望各地方總監府昂揭國國民士氣，挺身奮鬥，大意如下：</p>
<p>政府今後之方針，已於前次會議席上述其大要，對本土化成戰塲後之國內施策，經加以精詳之檢討，大致巳予決定，此實爲現時各施策之基本方針。第二期（三個月）之物資動員計劃，亦已決定適應之方策，諸君須盡全力，促其具體實現，以期萬無一失。政府前曾決定將配給基準的予調整，幷爲　應國內人於戰塲化情勢，而決定食糧對策。政府之施策，於無論如何之事態下，亦須其體實行不解，以舉所期成果，以安定國民生活。切望　位尤須留意此點，體念政府之意旨隨機他變，以確立適合地方態勢之方策。再自沖繩戰局以來，敵之空襲頓形激化，其中各地方中小都市之被害亦不在少數，對多數罹災者衷心表示同情。然對敵侵寇本土企圖，必須信賴統帥部之萬全全準備，忍受一切痛苦勇往過進，以完遂聖戰。余幷望諸儲位或舞不屈不撓奮鬥之國民諸員，共立於抗戰之最前綫，以求最後勝利。</p>
<h3>保衛本土佈成堅陣日陸海軍伺機擊敵</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　敵機動部隊此次出戰之目的，由其作戰之經過以觀，顯在對處於B29。型攻擊圈外之日本東北。北海道地區實施行轟炸，實施所謂計劃的轟炸日本全國，破壞其軍需及生產施設，同時企圖切斷日本之交通級，頻雙於沿岸投下治機省，其行動殊堪注目。九州至關東之日本土，久已處於敵B29型之行動圈內，最近九州更劃入沖繩基地敵空軍之攻擊範圍內。七月以來，殆連日以中小型機來製九州，又由硫黃基地出發之P51型亦繼續攻擊日本土，此次更派遺機動部隊出戰於B29之攻擊圈外，企圖擴大轟炸範圍十日以來，接近日本土之機動部隊，刻　尚游弋於日本近海，故此後將出現於海域何方，施行其砲擊轟炸，殊難逆料，依然須加以警戒也。日陸海軍精銳對於敵之蠢動，刻正隱忍待機，期作量有效確中之攻擊，使敵陷於不能再起之境。當此決戰之時機，以確保相閱兵力，使用於電擊作戰法，最爲必要。</p>
<h3>粵慈善機關救濟空襲災民</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　美機連日轟炸市區民房，市民死傷至爲慘重。本市方便醫院善堂等大慈善機關，特於日前召集會議，討論救濟辦法，並即席通過發出宣言，向全國同胞及世界愛好和平之民族，呼籲請求予以阻止。</p>
<h3>蕪保安隊　訓練班開學</h3>
<p>蕪湖十七日中央社電　蕪保安隊爲提高士兵素質，特籌設保安隊訓練班，第一期受訓學員，業與十五日舉行開學典禮，正式開始訓練。</p>
<h3>印迫切要求重建自由</h3>
<p>斯木十七日中央社電　據此間獲悉：印度聯盟會秘書曼能，昨日向記者發表談話，略謂，「繼要求釋放主要政治罪犯之後，我人之第二步行動，即爲「重建印度人民自由」。同時關於臨時政府亦應即刻予以恢復，一部份尚未　放之政治犯，應即刻予以釋放，蓋將彼等禁錮在獄，實無公理可言。最近之西姆拉會議，即爲表現印度與同敎徒問並無區別，區別唯存在於回敎徒聯盟與其他各　派之</p>
<h3>B29型機編隊　侵襲關東地區　茨城福島亦遭受轟炸</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之B29型機約百九十架，自十六日下午十時半起，侵入日本土約四小時之久。共第一編隊約一百二十架，侵入京濱西南方，第二編隊七十架，侵入沼津。平塚。小田原。茅崎。辻堂等地，對地上投下燒夷彈，因是上述各都市發生火災，迄十七晨已全部撲滅。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　敵B29型機約三十架，於十六日下午十時半左右，侵人大分地區，對地上施行煌夷彈攻擊，致大分市及其附近發生火災，至十七日上午四時半左右完全撲滅。又敵B29型機約九十架，於十七日上午一時許，於桑名市附近投下　夷彈，因之案名市及其附近發生火災，迄當日拂曉全被撲滅。十六日畫日軍對來興東海地方之P51型加以遺擊，迄該日下午七時止，判明之戰果，計擊落七架，擊毀一架。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　敵機動部隊之艦載機，第一批約八十架，自十七日上午五時迄六時之悶，第二批八十架，自六時起約歷一小時，主要對霞浦。土浦，水戶方面，第三批約二十架，由　總方面侵入，對機塲及軍事設施，施行攻擊。</p>
<p>東京十七日巾央社電　於十四十五兩日來襲東北北海道南部地區之敵機動部隊，於十七日六時左右，復以艦載機約八十架來襲東北地區，主要對茨城福島兩縣之軍事設施，加以攻擊，迄七時左右遁去。</p>
<h3>襲東北區敵機擊落毀廿五架</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　東北軍管區司令部十六日發表：十四日及十五日來　東北地方之敵艦載機，前後共三百架，迄現在止業經判明之戰果，計擊落二十一架擊毀四架。又據當局發表，釡石市遭敵艦砲射擊及轟炸後發生火災，受相當損害。又靑函連絡船亦因遭敵機搶掃射，故有若干艘沉沒。</p>
<h3>塔那底島　日軍掃蕩殘敵　市日軍施果敢突擊</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地十七日中央社電　日軍爲期掃蕩塔那底島敵登陸軍，乃於十一日對該島北方調派兵力，獲得成功。同時更於西海岸壓制敵軍，於特塔德馬附近搜索大部敵軍，將其殲減，現正繼續掃　殘十敵中。迄現在經判明之戰果，計殺傷敵兵三百餘名，殲敵過牛云。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地十七日中央社電　　厘巴板方面戰况，現在薩馬林達公路上，敵以迫擊砲轟擊日軍陣地，但不甚激烈，敵因於十一日遭蒙重創，刻似在積極重整陣容，其後方陣地及登陸處所，敵之汽車來往極忙，日軍仍繼續施行勇敢之突襲戰法。自敵登陸以來迄現在。日軍收獲之戰果如次：殺傷敵軍四千名，擊沉或擊毀艦船十八艘，炸破敵重戰車五，戰車七，此外並鹵獲火砲極夥。</p>
<h3>英美蘇渝　對東亞問題</h3>
<p>意見互相矛盾</p>
<p>中央社訊　據滬市方面消息：此次宋子文遄赴莫斯抖，於六月三十日到達該地，至七月十四日離蘇返渝，其間逗留二星期，與史太林會見六次交換意見，終未獲得圖滿解決。惟據蘇淪之聯合聲明所稱，史宋不久將重行會談，目前各方面則傳稱須待三星期後始能實現。雖據綜合各方消息，傳已有圓滿之解決，其實則毫無具體結論，試觀蘇聯與渝政權所抱之世界觀念逈然不同，且雙方意見參差十立，今次宋子文赴莫斯科之任務，實際應美國之要求而確定成行者，以期對東亞問題向蘇聯有所試探。擬於十六日在柏林舉行之三國會議，以共同討論東亞問題，故重慶派遣宋子文赴莫斯科，以協調蘇聯對東亞之限度。蘇淪雙方在原則上對東亞之意見不同，在淪方意見，至今終不願蘇聯參加太平洋戰爭，如蘇同意參加，則今後蘇軍即將閒入中國領土，而美國對淪方意見雖雷同，惟不同者厥爲求太平洋戰爭迅即解決。淪方表示則希望延長戰爭，以保存本身實力，據蔣介石所稱在目前頗感困難，以太平洋戰爭愈持久，則日美兩國實力越銳落，則美國隊渝方之壓迫自當逐漸改變軟化，對將來之重慶自益爲有利。故蔣介石對美國態度一位敷衍，以保持實力。在蘇聯方面自歐戰結束後，因過去損失頗鉅，故不顧向東亞出兵，解決太平洋戰爭，表示太平洋戰事愈久，則對蘇亦有利。在美國削弱實力之下，則可謀本身實力之擴充，一方面在發言權上尤可强硬，故美蘇渝以及英國之意見各懷叵測，且矛盾百山，因此宋子文此次赴莫斯科之折衝，殊難如願以債，不能一時解決。</p>
<h3>日佐藤大使　晤蘇外長</h3>
<p>莫斯科十七日中央社電　日佐　大使於本月十日，曾與蘇外委會次長洛恩夫斯基會見，繼於次（十一）日復與蘇外委長莫洛托夫會見。</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3>南匯近貌</h3>
<p>— 藍彧</p>
<h3>縣治交通</h3>
<p>南滙縣城，建於明洪武十九年，周圍約三里許。東南濱東海，西南接奉賢，北連川沙，西北毘申江海岸，地當長江要衝。</p>
<p>由上海到南滙的交通，先乘上南路的小火車抵達周浦，上南路之終點，接周南公路，無公共汽車，每日有一民營之卡車充代，時間不一定，乘客須預先在車站旁等候，否則只有　小汽車，車站超過卡車一倍以上。水路有兩家內河輸行駛，沿途治安，敎陸上爲遜。到用沙奉資有南川南奉三幹綫，路面不平，治安鞭長莫及，羣常車輛不敢輕易深入。該縣計分八區，二十九鎭，八十六鄕，合計有十二萬五千八百三十五戶，五十二萬二千九百人，可謂爲上海市之音懸。</p>
<h3>南市景況</h3>
<p>在南滙之房屋，被破壞者頗多，有毀於炸彈，有爲　民拆賣，以北門帶。最爲荒凉。戰前的縣政府，要算是頂好的建築了，現成了一片廣塲，改作了運動塲之用，當日的盛况，只能在憶想中得之。</p>
<p>以言商業，南滙雖是縣垣，却遠不如周浦，全市無規模可觀之商店，衛　亦至狹窄，近來以營業淸淡，同時各項苛報供應基重，商民無力維持，乃因此歇業者頗多。這些商業中，以飯館及旅館業最慘，飯館業在中晚二市，熒乎門可羅雀，而其售價，比上海尤爲同昂。旅館業僅有南滙新及東雅等三家，設備簡陋。</p>
<h3>金融現象</h3>
<p>金融業有六七家，因受環境影響，改變經營方式，都從反常方面求收入，一壁發行本票，一壁做着高利貸及　現。在營業上看來，搶些金融業定可獲致厚利，實則不然，他們也有很深的隱痛。據一金融業負責人告記者：在表面上，金融業是可以獲利的，然而在暗底裏，却有許多强迫透支者，這些透支者，先以極少數的款項開立戶頭，隔一個時期，便開出一筆相當數目的支票，派人提取，倚仗着特殊勢力，使金融業不得不忍痛兌付。所以這些金融業，變管挖空心思，幹着非法的勾當，而結果等於白忙，可是，羊毛出在羊身上，最吃虧的還是一般被剝創者。</p>
<p>另外尚有一種現象，便是在市上常可見到一種遠期支票，此類遠期支票，有的是常地行莊，有的竟是在上海，時期差一兩個月是不算希奇的，發行的主人，大抵是那般透支者，他們到街坊上購物，經當給支票一紙，餘下的零頭，尚須叫店家找還。這些支票旣不能向行莊兌現，收到後又不能通用，這樣的兩受損失，自然是店家袛有自認晦氣了。在這裏姑舉一個例子，現當地燃料十分缺乏，但是在四鄕，柴草却異常充斥，爲什麽不輸。運至該處呢，一言以蔽之：就是因爲柴販商曾吃了遠期支票之虧。</p>
<h3>田賦征收</h3>
<p>該縣之田賦，計分圖田及團田兩種，城廂以西爲圖田，城廂以東爲團田，此外猶有灶課地及蘆課地等區別，合計全縣擊田，共有一百二十七萬八千餘畝。農作物方面，往年以棉花爲大宗，嗣因棉花價格不及食米，故農戶均改營稻作。據當地老農談，在戰前一擔棉在，可抵米一擔半，現在一担棉花之奮價，爲二十五萬，不及米之半數，而棉花之施肥並不亞於稻作。按農家農業收成，大致戰前米爲三成，棉爲六成，雜糧一成；現米爲六成，棉爲二成，雜糧爲二成。</p>
<p>田賦之開征，自六月份起，改爲實物徵收，先徵十分之三，因農戶積穀無多，故暫先以小麥代替，計麥四十斤，合米一斗，每戶先徵十二斤，由指定之四家糧號代收。完賦的方式，係由農戶將實物自動繳代征處，這辦法固良佳，可免鄕保長中飽，但鄉區治安欠良，萬一途中被刦，農民不獨徒勞仔返，並且要再多一層補徵的負担，據記者叩詢常地耆老，以彼等之意見，最好在各鄕徧設代徵處，旣可便利農戶，抑可事半功倍。</p>
<h3>教育慈善</h3>
<p>在當地之學校，以市立五中校有成績，過去爲一天主堂，鐘樓高聳雲際。全縣計有縣立師範一處，中學二所，完全小學二十三所，最近專員公署擬成立　南川申奉四縣聯合中學，校址大約設於該縣周浦鎭，正在籌辦之中。</p>
<p>民敎範在中山公園，綠蔭業中，可望建築壯麗之中山紀念堂，堂之正巾，懸有林故主席「典型仰止」的扁額，民敎館即設在巾山堂內。由於經費缺乏，現僅有報紙一二份可供閱覽。該館謂館長，另主辦有人開小型五日刋一張，以地方新聞爲特色，行銷轄境。當地縣府，爲繁業市面，新近在新塲招得一紹興戲旅行劇團，假中山堂演唱，除門票收入之外，縣府每日另貼食米一斗。</p>
<p>談到慈善事業，最引爲遺憾的是救濟院，該院已具悠久歷史，收容老殘幼童孀婦有二百餘人，平時經費，係靠公產收人，計有公田數萬畝，分散各鄕，事變以還，鄕區情形複雜，田租之收入，年復減少，過去尚可勉力維持，比來各項物價猛　，主事者支撑乏術，遂不得不陷於停頓。規在這批難民，均流落街頭，嗷嗷待哺，厥狀至慘。</p>
<h3>物價一斑</h3>
<p>記者一行抵南滙時，是七月一日，當時米價爲六十七萬，汕八千五百元，肉四千餘元，鹽一千餘元。日用品以外，其他亦較上海爲高，以飯館而言，普通一菜，在七千元以上，白飯一小碗售二千元，一人吃白節三碗，半湯半菜一隻，即須達一萬餘元，加上捐稅小賬，可以想見，而此一餐，比上海的所謂「衛生快餐」，並不見得高明。尤有一奇事，那便是理髪一次要八千元，可謂聞所未聞。　工是以米價爲標準的，製長衣一件，需米九斤，合時價達三萬餘。嘗有可以縣府科員，戲謂記者：彼一月收人，爲一萬八千元，縱得免費配給布疋，區區一萬八千元，也不够縫製一件　衫的工錢。這雖是取笑，但足徵公務員的待遇實在太少，物價實在太高了。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>突襲聲中幾件要務</h3>
<p>日昨本市又遭敵機空襲，敵方B二四及B五型機約六十餘架，侵入市空，竟自雲上向數處投彈，致東北地區，有數處發生火災，該處爲平民腐集之區，故實際上遭受損害的，和上次城內三牌樓被炸時相同，完全是一般無辜的貧苦大衆。這是不能不使人痛心的事。但是，從這裏也可以得到一個啟示，就是敵機的來襲，並沒有目標可言，今後敵機隨時可來，今後敵彈隨處可投，所以全市居民，務必一致警備。除有保甲防空救護各負責方面，必須隨時保持動員狀態，一有警報，立即準備出動之外，就是一般居民，也務須完整一切救火救傷等等必要的設備，以便必要時可立刻用以救已助人，此外如土井及防空壕之挖掘，公私防空設施之隨時檢點淸理，各街所掘單人及公共防空壕內積水及積汚之淸除，晚間燈光之掩蔽等等，務須各自檢點，並互相勸導，以期萬一爲敵機投彈所中，也可以減少損害的程度。</p>
<p>敵機空襲而使一般居民橫遭無忘之災，這種盲目濫炸，徒然造成殘忍慘象，誠令人義憤塡膺，而增敵愾之心。同時也是爲國家爲戰爭而犧牲，所以國家有特別救濟補助的規定，共間除了各公私機關團體對於空襲下死傷者，定有各別的撫恤補助辦法之外，不久以前本市發動的救濟庫券，其中就也有一部份指定爲臨時災害救濟經費。今後敵機空襲如更頻仍，平民所受損害亦必增加，這一筆的款就有很犬的需用。同時，我們知道，尚有許多對救濟庫券雖已認購而尙未繳付的，希望大家趕速繳齊，爲公義與私德，都是不容再行遲緩了。</p>
<p>從目前時局來看，敵方顯有以冲繩島爲空軍基地，發動空中攻勢，由於木市已在其轟炸有效半徑以內，所以，今後敵機來襲之頻繁，是意想中事，爲了避免不必要的損害起見，凡是沒有留局上海至必要的，無論如何，總以早日疏散爲宜，特別是慈善救濟，文化敎育機關及團體，其中慈善團體，早巳指定疏散，而因種種托辭，延安迄今，仍未實施疏散，使本市疏散工作，未能循序拖進。其次，中等以上學校及專門學校，今後也不應留戀上海，應該儘速向四鄉及小城市疏散，爲了替國家社會保存元氣，爲了避免個人無謂的損害，我們希望各界領袖及早自動的推進疏散工作，其問有什麽困難，可以和本市疏散委員會進行協商，相信可以獲得相常的便利。</p>
<p>在空襲期間，我們必須再度向市民提出忠告，千萬不可無意識地登高瞭望或指手談笑，同時，今後敵機空襲不免頻緊，我們固然毋庸驚惶，不過，市塲謠言，經市儈奸商之傳播，以圖乘機抬高物價，不可不嚴密防同，希望當局隨時注意，有效防制，對於空襲時間犯罪行爲，政府早已定有法令，尤當嚴格執行。</p>

<h3>英美兩領袖舉行　非正式會談　開會前漫遊柏林一週</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電據柏林方面傳出消息：邱吉爾首相與特魯曼總統，曾於昨日在波次坦之會議廳內，舉行一次非正式會談，同時英美兩國高級參謀人員亦於該處集合，作首次聚談。然關於史太林元帥之是否已在拍林，目前尚無官方證實消息。特魯曼總統與前日在一隊武裝軍士之保護下漫遊柏林，渠曾參觀勃倫頓堡門之廢墟及林頓大費後，渠又往威海爾姆斯特拉斯之希特勒辦公署，特氏所經過之道上，戒備森嚴。邱吉爾首相於昨日亦於柏林城作一週密之巡禮，邱氏自乘車抵達波次　後，即偕同外相艾登酣遊，彼等於勃倫頓堡門備受該處柏林蘇聯軍事政府縣督柯拉包托夫將單之歡迎</p>
<h3>目賭戰跡觸景生情</h3>
<p>邱氏等首至德國過會參觀，次業希特勒辦公署，渠等由蘇聯守軍引導入內，見廳堂巍峨，然均遭火所焚燬。彼等復至希特勒之書室及宴客廳，艾登外相不禁觸景一情，憶及於一九三五年時曾與希特勒元首同餐於宴客廳內，彼等繼入希特勒著名之地下室參觀，邱氏興趣極濃厚。</p>
<h3>三頭會談　內容推測</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電關於三頭會談如何決定處理歐洲戰後及其他各案，各方臆測紛紜。頃綜合英美各種情報，其討論中心，大體爲下列各點：　「處理德意志案」，據倫敦時報之華盛頓訊，美總統似有擬成立英美蘇三國協定，其次加入法國；再成立四國協定，確立暫定及長久兩種處理方法之意。第一，爲於現美軍進駐地帶實施之，一年至五年爲期，第二，爲實行恒久和平體制，其內容雖尙不明，然似此使德國不能不復興爲要點。　「建報紐約特派員報到稱，特魯曼之主要目的有三，第一，根據大西洋憲章之原則，確立歐洲新秩序，第二，確定新歐洲國境綫，第三，以波次坦會議爲準備和平會議，以期州固其基礎　作。又路透社華盛頓電，則謂有關新解放地域及舊軸心衛星國之政治經濟問題，尤以民主主義體制問題，乃處理戰後及樹立新秩序之要點。。　「地中海及巴爾幹問題」巴爾幹各國國境紛爭，有關於英蘇兩國利害之現實問題，故似將就此協議何種處理方法。　「東亞問題」據每日郵報路透社電稱，一般多認爲於三頭會談席上，將以太平洋戰局及史太林與宋子文會議輕過等作爲議題，三國代表率領軍事最高首腦者參加會議之事實，乃爲此種觀測之根據，而各報均一致重視蘇聯之立塲。</p>
<p>蘇黎世十七日中央社電　三頭會談除討論德佔領地之共同統治方式外，並將檢討賠償問題。據英國消息靈通人士觀測，賠償額一項二百意元。此恐不以現金付償而以勞力代至，據言蘇聯爲戰後復興，曾要求之勞力達二百萬人。此外東亞問題，亦當爲議題之一，因蘇聯對於東亞問題現正關注異常也。</p>
<h3>飽斯廣播</h3>
<p>昭南十七日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席飽斯氏，十五日就西姆拉會議決裂一事，於昭南對印度國內廣播稱，印度方面對老奸巨滑之英國提案，敢加反抗，實爲獨立運動及爲印度全體與爲余個人所極應欣慶者也。同時此次會議曾全部通過國民會議派指導者所表示之態度，但爲頓及將來計，實有再加檢討與反省之必要。　自此次華維爾提案以來，會議派內之尼赫魯等一黨，其最先即對英國獻媚，實屬遺憾，尤以稱讃英國及華維爾之誠意，實爲無謂之至，可謂爲自動放棄三年前吾等之誓言，然觀廿地翁之堅定態度。則値得歉佩。　關於貫澈實行主義一點，當以回敎聯盟之琴那方而爲最正確者。按琴那爲實現使回印兩敎徒分野之理想，曾顯示最正當之態度，然會議派之一部領袖，錯認華維爾有與會議派立於同等地位，不然英國絕不與吾等發生此密切關係，若渠等未攷慮及此點，則無充任會議派領袖之資格。因此結果，琴那於西姆拉會　有愈增權成可能，反之，會議派則已失其威信，恐將招致今後對英抗爭之種種不利。會議派之活動，由印度獨立鬥爭之情勢上觀察，大體原極有利。然竟不自省察，反而自陷於打破昔日誓言之境界，其無定見可知，今後此種態度，當須加以改新。　將來於西姆拉會議等席上，會議派無與他派同席之必要，蓋所謂和平會議者，木爲意志相投之同志會議也，與英國抗爭者，非回敎聯盟而係會議派，因回敎聯明爲地主資本家從事運動，不過　由英國人操縱下保特其權威而，已惟有會議派之遝動，方可謂爲印度國民之眞、運動云。</p>

<p>邀擊戰鬬</p>
<p>昨日下午一時零五分，敵機對本市區大舉盲炸，由雲層投彈，是日晨因敵機數度飛來偵察，故早已察知敵機企圖蠢動，我方之防空準備益形　固。果於是時敵機來襲，飛行極高，機身隱於雲中，由其機聲判明爲B24型與B25型機，架數約四五十架，由東向西擬橫過本市區東北部，我方防空砲火猛烈轟射，敵機爲避免中彈，即行向北部遁走，日邀擊戰上下機亦起而追而追逐。其後一時三十五分，敵機再度來襲，實行波狀攻擊，盲目轟炸，碇泊江上之日艦即向之發砲，地上砲火亦猛烈放射，邀擊陣之砲火至爲熾烈，敵機徒犧牲無辜平民，下行一時五十一分倉惶向西方遁去。</p>

<h3>二千萬元空頭支票詐欺財物破案　老闡分局拘獲歹徒法辦</h3>
<p>自本市現鈔不敷應市後，撥款單本票，充溢市上，同時支票付賑之風亦熾，以致僞造塗改撥款單及本票之案，亦隨之迭起，業經警務當局，一再破案，拘獲罪犯法辦。茲悉老闡分局又破獲一歹徒，以空頭支票詐欺達二千餘萬之鉅案，被害者達數十餘家，罪犯李阿富，瞿達，許敏等三人，均已先後拘獲歸案。茲將詳情分誌於後：</p>
<p>利用舞女假充闊客</p>
<p>有歹徒李阿富，瞿達，許敏等三人，前曾犯綁票等案被判刑，自刑滿出獄後，無所事事，即在南　坡路新都公寓開二十一號房間借寓，企圖使用空頭支票，欺詐財物，故在棉布銀行及寳源錢荘分別開立往來戶頭，領有支票簿三本，在外無論購物飲食，均濫開支票。曾有大滬舞廳女王德華，高秋霞，鄭雪芳，亦借寓於隔室二十二號房間，於王高等吹奏口琴時，即和以口琴，以至相識。繼而百般引誘，均入其圈套。於七月十一日，李阿富，瞿達，許敏偕同王高鄭等三舞女，自新者公寓至大中華咖啡館飲咖啡，飲畢開發支票付賬，繼而至康樂酒家進晚餐，再至伊文泰夜總會跳舞，最後至祥生飯店闢室付賬，均簽支票。</p>
<p>汽車兜風騙取物品</p>
<p>至翌晨七時許，同起雇得雲飛汽車公司出差汽車兜風，先至　華，在　華廟門外，以支票購買桃子後，即命車夫開回上海，至落陽路大新百貨商店，以支票購買香港衫，及女用化粧品等達六十餘萬元，再登車至華山路榮康泗家進膳，繼至正陽路金虎皮鞋公司購買女皮鞋五雙，至斜橋弄萬昌雨衣公司購買雨衣八件，值二百餘萬元，再至金門服裝公司買大衣三件，繼而至外灘華　飯店等闢室未着，至芝罘路天然飯店開闢三三八號房間，將所有物件如數放入房間後，登車至亨得利購得手錶三只，價值一百八十五萬元，以上均以支票付賬。至四時許，共入新亞酒樓進餐，當塲付車夫車租五十三萬元支票小賬十八萬元支票各一張命去。在新雅共吃賬十三萬三千七百二十元，當由李阿富又開寳源錢荘支票十五萬元付賬被拒，致起衝突，李阿富·許敏見勢不佳，先偕高秋霞·鄭雪芳逸去，當由該泗樓侍役報吿賬房，將瞿達王德華抵至老闡分局報吿，由第三股主任命警佐張國棟，警長劉宗桐·沈志明等偵查，供出前情，並四出偵查，在大江南旅館五六五號，將其餘各犯李阿富·許敏及被利用之舞女高秋霞·鄭雪芳拘獲，並將該日騙得之物，全部抄獲。</p>

<h3>舞塲提早營業將受懲處</h3>
<p>市警察局對舞廳之營業，時間規定於每日下午五時至晚十一時半止，（五時至七時爲茶舞，八時至十一時半爲晚舞）。惟邇來一般舞廳竟罔顧法令，提早營業，每日下午二時至五時亦舉行茶室舞，殊爲非是，故經第二處行政科飭令取締禁止茶室舞，如違當予從嚴懲處，並着各分局查禁，至於咖啡館於上開時間亦禁止跳舞。</p>

<h3>行荘客戶票據將收隔日賬　銀錢業定期一致實行</h3>
<p>本市銀行兩業各會員行荘，曾以收受票據日增，交換及轉賬手續，殊感困難，即倡議實行票據隔日交換。嗣經錢業表示異議，此事遂吿　議。現悉該兩業各銀行錢荘，收到所有存戶票據，已自行普遍收隔日賬，且有若干行荘通知客戶，銀錢業將於本月二十日起，一致實行。客戶存入當日票據，但收隔日賬一節，記者以此事分向銀錢業方面探詢　詳，據云：票據存入收隔日賬，各行荘多已自動實行，尤其　市中心區之各同業，並已行之甚久，故銀錢兩業對於此事之一致實行，已予以積極考慮，大致不久可望實行，所云定期於二十日實行，尙未經銀錢業正式通吿。按此收隔日賬即無形間已成爲當日收入票據，隔日辦理交換，而收隔日賬。</p>

<h3>本市縣警配給香烟</h3>

<h3>不塡特稅發票各商店受罰</h3>
<p>本市商店對於財政局制定之代征消費特稅塡用發票規則，不遵照辦理，被財政局查出處罰暑，有六百四十餘家之多。茲又經該局監察科派員調查各商店是否章使用發票，結果查得湖北路一二八號袁大昌烟行等三十家，雖已購有特稅發票，並不塡給顧客。實有故意偷稅之嫌。又靜安寺路七五五號開利公司等二十家使用未經送局蓋印之自備發票，亦有違功令。以上各家，均經財政局按情節輕重分別處罰。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>新舊申請生六千子弟嗷嗷待哺</h3>
<p>願熱心人士速加援手</p>
<p>本報讀者助學多，上屆受助生三千七百餘人，原是第七屆的舊生，當時各校新生紛紛求補助，本報因各界捐款有限，不敷分配，就拒絕了新生的申請，本是無可奈何的事！然而我們總覺得不收新生，是不合理也不忍出此的。所以本屆決定除舊生照發申請書外，又發給新生申請書由各級學校　選淸寒優秀的學生，愼重推　，再經本處嚴格甄別，選成績最優秀的，錄取爲本屆受助生。連日舊生到館領取申請書的，非常踴躍，新生由各校代領的也接踵而來，看情形這六千子弟都有獲得助金的希望，即使甄試之後，不管新舊生將有許多被淘汰，這完全以自己的成績來卜倖運，好在甄試最爲公正嚴明，一點不會偏頗的；所以諸多有眞才實學的，絕對不必憂慮！</p>
<p>其實，值得憂慮的，到是本屆助金捐款，十天來未見好轉，熱心有力的慈善家，不知怎的還姍姍來遲，認隊　寥。諸位善士：這六千子弟，好似枝頭小鳥，嗷嗷待哺，情景十分　切，希望熱心的善士們，速加援手，予以物質的救濟，使他們求知慾，不致遭受意外的飢荒！</p>

<h3>滬東北被炸區一瞥</h3>
<p>— 其昌</p>
<p>昨天下午一時許，敵機六十餘架，侵入本市上空，濫施轟炸，這一次的空襲，可以說是平民受禍最大的一次了。　　　區尤以滬東北　　　。有好幾條街道被波及。</p>
<p>死傷的人數還沒有統計，除了一部份爲普善山荘運走外，重傷約搬入厚生等醫院的總共有數百人。記者到災區巡視的時候，還有數十具屍首排列在人行道上，任他們的親族前去認領。</p>
<p>在某一個十字路有著許多飯攤，點心攤，大餅攤，瓜果攤，這正是中午吃飯的時候，一些苦力們正在進餐，或是略作片刻休息，然而一刻那炸彈正落在這里，就完全同歸於盡了。像這樣不明不白死掉的就有好幾十個</p>
<p>死傷的人幾乎完全是平民。這次受災地區也都是以商店和住宅佔多數。從那些破碎了的招牌上還能依稀看出是烟紙店，鞋帽店，雜貨店等等。僅僅在極短的時間之前，這裏還是一條熙熙攘攘的繁華街道，而現在却烟　迷漫，房屋東倒西歪的破爛不堪了。</p>
<p>除了馬路上一個血肉模糊的屍體外，更　一大片一大片的濃厚的血跡，被人們践踏着，被壓在瓦礫和木料下而被活埋的人也還不知有多少。在靠近人行道旁的還比較容易發現，記者在出事四小時後還看見一個人被從磚堆裏拖出，傷並不十分重，假如能早一些被發現，也許還不至於死掉！</p>
<p>中國人和猶太人的救災人員是頗够努力的，在烈火逼人的路上瓦爍上奔走着，見義勇爲而進行救護工作。受傷者躺在卡車上，人力車上，担架上被送到各處去急救。在空的担架上幾乎都染滿了斑斑的血痕，有的甚至於一大片血還在帆布上搖動着。</p>
<p>全家都死亡了的，在此次空袭中，大概也很不少。有個人聽說這一帶被炸，特地趕來探望一家親戚，但是當這人好容易辯認出那些家所在時，只看到些破磚亂瓦了。問了問旁邊的人，才知道這家兩個重傷的人已被送到一家醫院去了。</p>
<p>由於這次空襲受災的慘重和範圍之廣，我們覺得必須加强防空知識的灌溉，和救災救護的技術訓練，以及對災區災民廣泛的救濟工作。尤其重要的，是希望市民趕緊疏散，　　不必要的死傷和損失。</p>

<h3>Implementing Various Decisive Measures to Gather All Strength and Strive for Victory: Address by the Prime Minister at the Local Governors' Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki, in his opening address at the Local Governors' Conference on the 16th, strongly stated that in the face of the enemy's fierce attacks, every citizen should trust the high command's complete preparations, endure all hardships, and gather all strength to advance bravely on the path to completing the Holy War. He expressed his hope that each local governor would uplift national morale and bravely fight. The gist of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The government's future policies were largely outlined at the previous meeting. Domestic measures to address the situation after the homeland becomes a battlefield have been carefully reviewed and largely finalized. This is the basic policy for current measures. The second phase (three months) of the material mobilization plan has also been finalized, and you must do your utmost to ensure its concrete implementation without fail. The government has previously decided to adjust the rationing standards and to implement food measures in response to the situation where the domestic area is turning into a battlefield. The government's policies must be implemented thoroughly under all circumstances to achieve the desired results and stabilize the lives of the people. It is hoped that all of you will pay particular attention to this point, understand the government's intentions, adapt flexibly, and establish measures suitable for local conditions. Furthermore, since the Battle of Okinawa, enemy air raids have intensified significantly, and many small and medium-sized cities have suffered damage. I express my heartfelt sympathy to the numerous victims. However, regarding the enemy's attempt to invade the homeland, we must trust the high command's complete preparations, endure all hardships, and advance bravely to complete the Holy War. I also hope that all of you and the indomitable citizens will stand together on the front lines of the resistance to achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Defending the Homeland by Building a Solid Fortress: Japanese Army and Navy Await Opportunities to Strike the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Judging from the course of their operations, the enemy's mobile unit's purpose in this battle is clearly to bomb the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions of Japan, which are outside the B29 bomber range, and to carry out so-called planned bombing of the entire country of Japan, destroying its military and production facilities. At the same time, they are attempting to cut off Japan's transportation lines and frequently dropping mines along the coast. Their actions are noteworthy. The Japanese mainland, from Kyushu to Kanto, has long been within the range of the enemy's B29s. Recently, Kyushu has been included in the attack range of the enemy's air force based in Okinawa. Since July, medium and small-sized aircraft have been attacking Kyushu almost daily. P51s departing from Iwo Jima are also continuing to attack the Japanese mainland. This time, the enemy has dispatched a mobile unit to fight outside the B29 range, attempting to expand the bombing area. For the past ten days, the mobile unit approaching the Japanese mainland has been cruising off the Japanese coast. Therefore, it is difficult to predict where it will appear in the sea area to carry out its shelling and bombing, and vigilance is still necessary. The elite forces of the Japanese Army and Navy are enduring and waiting for an opportunity to make effective and accurate attacks, bringing the enemy to a state where it cannot rise again. At this decisive moment, it is most necessary to secure the viewing troops and use them in blitzkrieg operations.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Charity Organizations Provide Relief to Air Raid Victims</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) - American aircraft have been bombing the city's residential areas for days, causing heavy casualties among civilians. The city's major charitable organizations, such as the Fangbian Hospital and Shantang, convened a meeting recently to discuss relief measures and immediately passed a declaration calling on compatriots across the country and peace-loving peoples of the world to help stop the bombings.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Security Corps Training Class Opens</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to improve the quality of its soldiers, the Wuhu Security Corps established a training class. The first group of trainees held an opening ceremony on the 15th and officially began training.</p>
<h3>India Urgently Demands the Restoration of Freedom</h3>
<p>Simla, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to information obtained here: Mannu, secretary of the Indian League, told reporters yesterday, "Following the demand for the release of major political prisoners, our second step is to 'restore the freedom of the Indian people'." At the same time, the interim government should also be restored immediately, and the political prisoners who have not yet been released should be released immediately, as there is no justice in keeping them in prison. The recent Simla Conference showed that there is no difference between Indians and co-religionists, the difference only exists between the Muslim League and other factions.</p>
<h3>B29s in Formation Invade the Kanto Region; Ibaraki and Fukushima Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 190 B29s from the Mariana Islands base invaded the Japanese mainland for about four hours starting at 10:30 PM on the 16th. The first formation of approximately 120 aircraft invaded the southwest of Keihin (Tokyo-Yokohama area), and the second formation of 70 aircraft invaded Numazu, Hiratsuka, Odawara, Chigasaki, Tsujido, and other places, dropping incendiary bombs. Fires broke out in the above-mentioned cities, and were completely extinguished by the morning of the 17th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 30 enemy B29s invaded the Oita area around 10:30 PM on the 16th, attacking the ground with incendiary bombs, causing fires in and around Oita City, which were completely extinguished around 4:30 AM on the 17th. Also, approximately 90 enemy B29s dropped bombs near Kuwana City around 1:00 AM on the 17th, causing fires in and around the city, which were all extinguished by dawn. On the 16th, the army carried out a surprise attack on P51s coming to the Tokai region. The confirmed results by 7:00 PM that afternoon were 7 shot down and 1 destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit's carrier-based aircraft, the first batch of approximately 80 aircraft, mainly attacked Kasumigaura, Tsuchiura, and Mito from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM on the 17th, and the second batch of 80 aircraft attacked for about an hour from 6:00 AM. The third batch of approximately 20 aircraft invaded from the north and attacked airfields and military facilities.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit, which attacked the Tohoku and southern Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th, again attacked the Tohoku region with approximately 80 carrier-based aircraft around 6:00 AM on the 17th, mainly attacking military facilities in Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures, and fled around 7:00 AM.</p>
<h3>25 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down and Destroyed in Attacks on the Tohoku Region</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Tohoku Military District Command announced on the 16th: A total of 300 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Tohoku region on the 14th and 15th. As of now, the confirmed results are 21 shot down and 4 destroyed. According to authorities, a fire broke out in Kamaishi City after being shelled and bombed by enemy warships, causing considerable damage. Several Seikan (Aomori-Hakodate) ferry boats were also sunk due to enemy strafing.</p>
<h3>Ternate Island: Japanese Army Clears Out Remaining Enemy; Japanese Army Launches Daring Attacks</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to clear out the enemy landing forces on Ternate Island, the Japanese army dispatched troops to the northern part of the island on the 11th, which was successful. At the same time, they suppressed the enemy on the west coast, searched for and annihilated a large part of the enemy army near Tetademaru, and are currently continuing to clear out the remaining enemy. As of now, the confirmed results are more than 300 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, and the enemy completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 17th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the battle situation in the Balikpapan area, the enemy is bombarding the Japanese army's positions with mortars on the Samarinda highway, but not very fiercely. Because the enemy suffered heavy losses on the 11th, they seem to be actively reorganizing their forces. Enemy vehicles are extremely busy going back and forth in their rear positions and landing areas. The Japanese army is continuing to carry out brave surprise attacks. The results achieved by the Japanese army since the enemy landed are as follows: 4,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 18 warships sunk or destroyed, 5 enemy heavy tanks and 7 tanks destroyed, and a large number of artillery pieces captured.</p>
<h3>Great Britain, the US, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing: Conflicting Opinions on East Asian Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - According to news from Shanghai: Song Ziwen's swift trip to Moscow, arriving on June 30th and leaving for Chongqing on July 14th, staying for two weeks, meeting with Stalin six times to exchange views, ultimately did not achieve a satisfactory resolution. However, according to the joint statement by the Soviet Union, Stalin and Song will hold talks again soon, but current reports indicate that this will not be possible until three weeks later. Although various sources claim that a satisfactory solution has been reached, there is actually no concrete conclusion. The worldviews held by the Soviet Union and the Chongqing regime are vastly different, and their opinions differ greatly. Song Ziwen's trip to Moscow was actually determined to be undertaken at the request of the United States, with the aim of exploring the Soviet Union's views on East Asian issues. The three-nation conference to be held in Berlin on the 16th will jointly discuss East Asian issues, so Chongqing dispatched Song Ziwen to Moscow to coordinate the Soviet Union's limits on East Asia. The Soviet Union and Chongqing hold different opinions on East Asia in principle. In Chongqing's opinion, it is still unwilling for the Soviet Union to participate in the Pacific War. If the Soviet Union agrees to participate, then Soviet troops will soon enter Chinese territory. Although the United States agrees with Chongqing's opinion, the difference lies in seeking a swift resolution to the Pacific War. Chongqing expresses its hope to prolong the war in order to preserve its own strength. According to Chiang Kai-shek, he feels quite difficult at present. The longer the Pacific War lasts, the more the strength of Japan and the United States will decline, and the United States' pressure on Chongqing will gradually change and soften, which will be more beneficial to Chongqing in the future. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards the United States is one of perfunctory, in order to maintain strength. On the Soviet Union's side, after the end of the European War, because of the huge losses in the past, it did not consider sending troops to East Asia to resolve the Pacific War, expressing that the longer the Pacific War lasts, the more beneficial it will be to the Soviet Union. With the United States weakening its strength, it can seek to expand its own strength, and on the one hand, it can be more forceful in its voice. Therefore, the opinions of the United States, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and Great Britain are all unpredictable and full of contradictions, so Song Ziwen's trip to Moscow to negotiate will be difficult to achieve as desired and cannot be resolved immediately.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Sato Meets with Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Moscow, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador Sato met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky on the 10th of this month, and then met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the next (11th) day.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Recent Scenes of Nanhui</h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<h3>County Seat Transportation</h3>
<p>Nanhui County Town was built in the 19th year of the Ming Hongwu period, with a circumference of about three li. It borders the East China Sea to the southeast, Fengxian to the southwest, Chuansha to the north, and the Shenjiang coast to the northwest, strategically located at the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The transportation from Shanghai to Nanhui is as follows: first, take the Shangnan Road small train to Zhoupu, the end point of Shangnan Road, connecting to the Zhounan Highway. There are no public buses, and a private truck operates daily as a substitute, with uncertain times. Passengers must wait in advance next to the station, otherwise only take a small car, which costs more than double the truck fare. There are two inland waterways operating, and the security along the route is slightly better than on land. The Nanchuan and Nanfeng three trunk lines lead to Yongsasha, but the road surface is uneven and security is lacking, so commercial vehicles do not easily venture deep. The county is divided into eight districts, twenty-nine towns, and eighty-six townships, totaling 125,835 households and 522,900 people, making it a throat of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Conditions</h3>
<p>Many houses in Nanhui have been destroyed, some by bombs and some by residents demolishing and selling them, with the area near the North Gate being the most desolate. The pre-war county government was considered the best building, but it is now a large square, converted into a sports field. The glory of the past can only be imagined.</p>
<p>In terms of commerce, Nanhui, although a county seat, is far inferior to Zhoupu. The entire city has no large-scale shops, and the streets are very narrow. Recently, due to sluggish business and heavy burdens of various unreasonable surcharges, merchants are unable to maintain operations, resulting in many closures. Among these businesses, restaurants and hotels are the worst off. Restaurants are almost deserted in the evening markets, and their prices are even higher than in Shanghai. There are only three hotels, such as Nanhui Xin and Dongya, with simple facilities.</p>
<h3>Financial Phenomena</h3>
<p>There are six or seven financial institutions, which, due to the influence of the environment, have changed their business methods and are seeking income from abnormal means. On the one hand, they issue promissory notes, and on the other hand, they engage in high-interest loans and speculation. On the surface, it seems that financial institutions can obtain high profits, but in reality, this is not the case. They also have deep hidden pains. According to a person in charge of a financial institution, financial institutions can profit on the surface, but in secret, there are many people forcing overdrafts. These overdrafts first open accounts with very small amounts of money, and after a period of time, they issue a check for a considerable amount, sending people to withdraw it, relying on special influence to force the financial institution to reluctantly pay it. Therefore, these financial institutions are racking their brains to do illegal things, and the result is equivalent to working for nothing. However, what is taken from the sheep comes back to the sheep, and it is the general public who are exploited and suffer the most.</p>
<p>There is another phenomenon, which is that long-term checks are often seen on the market. Some of these long-term checks are from local banks, and some are even from Shanghai. It is not uncommon for the term to be one or two months. The issuers are mostly those who overdraft. They give a check to the shop when they buy things in the neighborhood, and even ask the shop to return the change. These checks cannot be cashed at the bank, and they cannot be used after being received. Such double losses naturally mean that the shop has to admit to bad luck. Here is an example: local fuel is very scarce, but firewood is unusually abundant in the surrounding villages. Why not transport it there? In a nutshell: it is because firewood merchants have suffered from long-term checks.</p>
<h3>Land Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The county's land tax is divided into two types: diagrammed land and group land. The area west of the city is diagrammed land, and the area east of the city is group land. In addition, there are also distinctions such as salt field land and reed field land. In total, the county has more than 1,278,000 mu of cultivated land. In terms of crops, cotton was the main crop in the past, but because the price of cotton is lower than that of rice, farmers have switched to rice cultivation. According to local old farmers, before the war, one dan of cotton could be worth one and a half dan of rice, but now the price of one dan of cotton is 250,000, less than half the price of rice, and the fertilization of cotton is no less than that of rice. According to farmers' agricultural income, roughly before the war, rice accounted for 30%, cotton for 60%, and miscellaneous grains for 10%; now rice accounts for 60%, cotton for 20%, and miscellaneous grains for 20%.</p>
<p>The collection of land tax, starting from June, has been changed to in-kind collection, first collecting 30%. Because farmers do not have much grain stored, wheat is temporarily used instead, calculated as 40 jin of wheat equals 1 dou of rice. Each household first collects 12 jin, which is collected by the designated four grain stores on behalf of the tax office. The method of completing the tax is for farmers to automatically submit the in-kind items to the collection office. This method is certainly good, as it can prevent the village chiefs from embezzling, but the security in the rural areas is poor. If the items are robbed on the way, farmers will not only have worked in vain, but will also have to bear an additional burden of re-collection. According to the local elders, their opinion is that it is best to set up collection offices in various villages, which can facilitate farmers and be more efficient.</p>
<h3>Education and Charity</h3>
<p>Among the local schools, the municipal Fifth Middle School has good results. It used to be a Catholic church, with a bell tower soaring into the clouds. The county has one county-run normal school, two middle schools, and twenty-three complete elementary schools. Recently, the Commissioner's Office plans to establish a joint middle school for the Nanchuan, Shen, and Feng four counties, with the school site roughly located in Zhoupu Town of the county, and is currently under preparation.</p>
<p>The People's Education Center is located in Zhongshan Park, amidst lush trees, with the hope of building the magnificent Zhongshan Memorial Hall. In the center of the hall hangs the plaque "A Model to be Admired" by the late Chairman Lin. The People's Education Center is located inside the Zhongshan Hall. Due to lack of funds, only one or two newspapers are available for reading. According to the curator, another person runs a small five-day publication, featuring local news, which is sold in the area. The local county government, in order to prosper the market, recently recruited a Shaoxing opera troupe in Xinchang to perform at the Zhongshan Hall. In addition to the ticket revenue, the county government subsidizes one dou of rice per day.</p>
<p>Speaking of charitable undertakings, the most regrettable is the relief院 (orphanage), which has a long history, housing more than 200 elderly, disabled, orphans, and widows. Usually, the expenses are covered by public property income, with tens of thousands of mu of public land scattered in various villages. Since the incident, the situation in the rural areas has been complicated, and the income from land rent has been decreasing year by year. In the past, it could still be maintained with difficulty, but recently, various prices have risen sharply, and the person in charge has been unable to cope, so he has had to stop operations. It is reported that this group of refugees has wandered the streets, crying for food, in a miserable state.</p>
<h3>Glimpse of Prices</h3>
<p>When the reporter and his party arrived in Nanhui on July 1st, the price of rice was 670,000 yuan, the price of salt was 8500 yuan, the price of meat was over 4000 yuan, and the price of salt was over 1000 yuan. Other daily necessities were also higher than in Shanghai. In terms of restaurants, an ordinary dish costs over 7,000 yuan, and a small bowl of white rice costs 2,000 yuan. One person eats three bowls of white rice, half soup and half dish, which costs over 10,000 yuan, plus taxes and tips. One can imagine the cost. And this meal is not necessarily better than the so-called "hygienic fast food" in Shanghai. Another strange thing is that a haircut costs 8,000 yuan, which is unheard of. Tailors calculate prices based on the price of rice. To make a long robe requires nine jin of rice, costing over 30,000 yuan at current prices. A county government clerk joked to the reporter: his monthly income is 18,000 yuan, and even if he gets free cloth rations, 18,000 yuan is not enough to pay for the tailoring of a gown. Although this is a joke, it shows that civil servants' salaries are too low and prices are too high.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Several Important Tasks Amidst Air Raids</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our city was once again subjected to enemy air raids. Approximately sixty or so enemy B-24 and B-25 aircraft intruded into our airspace, indiscriminately dropping bombs from above the clouds onto several locations. This resulted in fires breaking out in several areas of the northeast district. This area is densely populated with civilians, so the actual damage suffered was similar to the previous bombing of Sanpailou in the inner city, affecting entirely innocent and impoverished masses. This is undeniably a cause for grief. However, it also offers a lesson: the enemy air raids lack any specific target. In the future, enemy aircraft may come at any time, and enemy bombs may be dropped anywhere. Therefore, all city residents must be consistently vigilant. Beyond the fact that the Baobaojia (local security system), air defense, and rescue personnel must remain in a constant state of readiness, and be prepared to mobilize immediately upon receiving an alert, ordinary residents must also ensure they have all necessary equipment for firefighting, first aid, etc., ready for immediate use to help themselves and others. Furthermore, the digging of earthen wells and air raid shelters, the regular inspection and cleaning of public and private air defense facilities, the removal of accumulated water and filth from individual and public air raid shelters in each street, the masking of lights at night, etc., must all be individually checked and mutually encouraged, in order to minimize the extent of damage in the event of being hit by enemy bombs.</p>
<p>Enemy air raids cause general residents to suffer unexpected disasters. This kind of indiscriminate and blind bombing merely creates scenes of cruelty and tragedy, which truly fills one with righteous indignation and fuels the spirit to resist the enemy. At the same time, it is a sacrifice for the nation and the war, so the nation has special regulations for relief and subsidies. In addition to the various public and private organizations and groups having their own separate methods for providing compensation and subsidies for those killed or injured in air raids, a portion of the relief bonds launched by our city not long ago has also been designated for temporary disaster relief funds. If enemy air raids become even more frequent in the future, the damage suffered by civilians will inevitably increase, and the need for this fund will be very high. At the same time, we know that there are still many who have subscribed to relief bonds but have not yet paid. We hope everyone will quickly complete their payments. For the sake of public justice and private morality, there is no room for further delay.</p>
<p>From the current situation, it is clear that the enemy intends to use Okinawa as an airbase to launch an aerial offensive. As our city is within its effective bombing radius, frequent enemy air raids are to be expected. To avoid unnecessary damage, those who do not have essential reasons to remain in Shanghai should evacuate as soon as possible. This is especially true for charitable relief, cultural, and educational institutions and groups. Charitable organizations, in particular, were designated for evacuation long ago, but due to various excuses, they have delayed until now, hindering the orderly progress of the city's evacuation efforts. Furthermore, secondary schools and vocational schools should also cease their attachment to Shanghai and evacuate to the countryside and smaller cities as soon as possible. To preserve the nation's and society's vitality, and to avoid pointless personal harm, we hope that leaders from all sectors will proactively promote evacuation. If there are any difficulties, they can consult with the city's Evacuation Committee, which we believe will provide considerable assistance.</p>
<p>During air raids, we must once again advise citizens not to unconsciously climb to high places to observe or point and laugh. At the same time, enemy air raids will inevitably become more frequent. While we should not panic, we must be vigilant against market rumors spread by unscrupulous merchants seeking to raise prices opportunistically. We hope the authorities will pay attention at all times and effectively prevent and control this. The government has already established laws and regulations for criminal behavior during air raids, which should be strictly enforced.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee Convened for Yan'an People's Congress</h3>

<h3>Dong Biwu Makes Remarks in the United States</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: According to Chongqing Broadcasting, Dong Biwu, the Yan'an representative to the San Francisco Conference who is currently staying in the United States, recently met with a United Press reporter and made the following remarks on issues such as the formation of a coalition government: If China adopts a one-party dictatorship after the war, civil strife will inevitably occur. If a democratic coalition government is established, civil strife can still be avoided. Although Yan'an has not sent representatives to the National Political Council, the councilors are still retained. In the future, if a coalition government can be established, Yan'an will definitely support Chiang Kai-shek as chairman.</p>
<h3>Italian "Patriot" Groups Dissolved</h3>
<p>Berne, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: According to news from Northern Italy: the Italian anti-Fascist "Patriot" groups were formally dissolved yesterday. However, in southern Italy, such as the Calabrian mountain region, a few groups are still active, and in the name of "anti-Fascism," they continue to resist dissolution. Several groups have even attacked prisons and those imprisoned within.</p>
<h3>British and American Leaders Hold Informal Talks - Touring Berlin for a Week Before the Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: According to reports from Berlin: Prime Minister Churchill and President Truman held an informal meeting in the conference hall in Potsdam yesterday. At the same time, senior staff members from the British and American armies gathered there for their first meeting. However, there is currently no official confirmation as to whether Marshal Stalin is already in Berlin. President Truman toured Berlin the day before, under the protection of a squadron of armed soldiers. He visited the ruins of the Brandenburg Gate and Unter den Linden. Afterward, he went to Hitler's office on Wilhelmstrasse. Security was tight along the roads that Truman traveled. Prime Minister Churchill also made a thorough tour of Berlin yesterday. After arriving in Potsdam by car, Churchill, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Eden, indulged in a tour. They were warmly welcomed at the Brandenburg Gate by Colonel General Kolpakov, the county governor of the Soviet military government in Berlin.</p>
<h3>Witnessing the Scars of War Evokes Emotions</h3>
<p>Churchill and others first visited the German Congressional Hall, followed by Hitler's office. They were led inside by Soviet guards, and saw the magnificent halls, all destroyed by fire. They then went to Hitler's study and banquet hall. Foreign Secretary Eden could not help but feel emotional, recalling that he had dined with Hitler in the banquet hall in 1935. They then visited Hitler's famous bunker, which Churchill found very interesting.</p>
<h3>Speculations on the Contents of the Big Three Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: Various speculations are circulating about how the Big Three Conference will decide on the post-war handling of Europe and other cases. Summarizing various British and American reports, the core of the discussions is generally the following points: "Handling the German Case": According to a Washington dispatch from The Times of London, the U.S. President seems to intend to establish a tripartite agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, followed by the addition of France, creating a four-nation agreement to establish both provisional and long-term handling methods. The first is to be implemented in the current U.S. occupied zone, with a duration of one to five years. The second is to implement a permanent peace system, the content of which is still unclear, but it seems that the key is to ensure that Germany cannot recover. "Establishing a New Order in Europe": A New York Times special correspondent reported that Truman's main objectives are threefold: first, to establish a new order in Europe based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter; second, to determine new European borders; and third, to use the Potsdam Conference to prepare for a peace conference, in order to solidify its foundation. A Reuters dispatch from Washington stated that political and economic issues in newly liberated areas and former Axis satellite states, especially the issue of democratic systems, are key to handling the post-war situation and establishing a new order. "The Mediterranean and Balkan Issues": Border disputes in the Balkan countries involve realistic issues of interest to both Britain and the Soviet Union, so it seems that agreement will be reached on how to handle these issues. "East Asian Issues": According to a Daily Mail Reuters dispatch, it is generally believed that the Pacific War situation and Stalin's meeting with Song Ziwen will be discussed at the Big Three Conference. The fact that the three countries' representatives are leading their highest military leaders to participate in the conference is the basis for this observation, and all newspapers emphasize the Soviet Union's position.</p>
<p>Zurich, 17th, Central News Agency Electric: In addition to discussing the joint administration of German occupied territories, the Big Three Conference will also review the issue of reparations. According to informed British sources, the amount of reparations is expected to be 20 billion yuan. This may not be paid in cash but in labor. It is said that the Soviet Union has requested 2 million laborers for post-war reconstruction. In addition, East Asian issues will also be on the agenda, as the Soviet Union is currently paying unusual attention to East Asian issues.</p>
<h3>Bose Broadcast</h3>
<p>Shonan (Singapore), 17th, Central News Agency Electric: Subhas Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, broadcast to India from Shonan on the 15th regarding the breakdown of the Simla Conference, stating that the Indian side's resistance to the cunning British proposal is a cause for great celebration for the independence movement, for all of India, and for himself personally. At the same time, the conference had fully adopted the attitude expressed by the leaders of the National Congress Party, but for the sake of the present and the future, there is a need for further review and reflection. It is regrettable that since the Wavell Proposal, a faction within the Congress Party, including Nehru, has been fawning over the British from the outset. Praising the sincerity of Britain and Wavell is especially pointless, and can be said to be an automatic abandonment of the oath we took three years ago. However, the firm attitude of Gandhi is admirable. Regarding the thorough implementation of principles, Jinnah of the Muslim League is the most correct. Jinnah has shown the most appropriate attitude to realize the ideal of dividing Hindus and Muslims. However, some leaders of the Congress Party mistakenly believe that Wavell is placing the Congress Party on an equal footing. Otherwise, Britain would never have such a close relationship with us. If they have not considered this point, then they are not qualified to be leaders of the Congress Party. As a result, Jinnah's power at the Simla Conference has increased, while the Congress Party has lost its credibility, which may lead to various disadvantages in future struggles against Britain. The Congress Party's activities, from the perspective of the Indian independence struggle, were originally very favorable. However, they failed to examine themselves and instead fell into breaking their former oaths. Their lack of a clear stance is evident, and this attitude must be changed in the future. In the future, the Congress Party does not need to sit at the same table as other factions at conferences such as the Simla Conference. The so-called peace conference is a meeting of like-minded comrades. It is the Congress Party, not the Muslim League, that is fighting against Britain, because the Muslim League is a movement engaged in by landlords and capitalists, merely preserving their authority under British control. Only the movement of the Congress Party can be said to be the true movement of the Indian people.</p>

<h3>Over Sixty Enemy Aircraft Attacked Shanghai Twice Yesterday - Indiscriminate Bombing of Residential Areas Kills and Injures Hundreds of Civilians</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Army and Navy Garrison Headquarters announced yesterday (17th) at 2:30 PM: At approximately 1:00 PM on July 17th, about 64 enemy B-24 and B-25 aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area, dropped bombs from above the clouds, and fled without a trace. Our losses were extremely minor.</p>
<p>(Further report) The areas bombed by the enemy aircraft were mostly unimportant, mostly civilian areas. The deaths and injuries number in the hundreds, and some areas were hit with incendiary bombs. Details are still being investigated.</p>
<p>Details of the Air Raid</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft's attacks on our city on the 17th were as follows: The first attack occurred at 1:05 PM, when enemy aircraft entered our city from the east and retreated to the north at 1:31 PM. The number of aircraft was approximately 50 B-24s and B-25s. The second attack occurred at 1:35 PM, when enemy aircraft entered our city from the east and retreated to the north at 1:51 PM. The number of aircraft was over 10 B-24s and B-25s. Both times, they indiscriminately bombed densely populated civilian areas in the northeast of our city from above the clouds, causing fires to break out in several places. All fires were extinguished within 30 minutes. Military facilities suffered almost no damage. Over 300 civilian houses were destroyed. As of now, approximately 300 deaths have been confirmed, approximately 120 people have been seriously injured, approximately 400 people have been slightly injured, and the total number of victims is feared to exceed 1,000.</p>
<p>Interception Battle</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:05 PM, enemy aircraft launched a large-scale indiscriminate bombing of our city, dropping bombs from the cloud cover. Because enemy aircraft had flown over several times to reconnoiter in the morning, we had already realized the enemy aircraft's intention to move. Our air defense preparations were strengthened. As expected, enemy aircraft attacked at that time, flying very high, with their bodies hidden in the clouds. Judging from the sound of the engines, they were B-24s and B-25s, numbering approximately 40-50. They intended to cross the northeast part of our city from east to west. Our air defense artillery fired fiercely. To avoid being hit, the enemy aircraft fled to the north. Our interception fighters also took off and pursued. Later, at 1:35 PM, enemy aircraft attacked again, launching a wave attack and bombing blindly. Japanese warships anchored on the river fired at them, and ground artillery also fired fiercely. The fire from the interception formation was extremely intense. The enemy aircraft merely sacrificed innocent civilians, and at 1:51 PM, they fled west in a panic.</p>
<p>Treatment of the Wounded</p>
<p>Those who were victims of the indiscriminate bombing in the eastern district of our city yesterday have been sent to relevant hospitals by the air defense authorities for treatment. The families of these injured patients must go to receive them by 3:00 PM this afternoon (18th). The locations for receiving the injured and bodies are listed below: Shanghai East Hospital, Meizhou Road, Yangshupu; Shanghai Sanitarium, Old Barracks Road (Wujin Road); Reception Center, Tangshan Road, Gongping Road, Tilanqiao.</p>
<h3>Scam Involving 20 Million Worth of Bad Checks Cracked - Laochang Precinct Arrests Criminals and Brings Them to Justice</h3>
<p>Since the current shortage of cash in our city, payment orders and promissory notes have flooded the market. At the same time, the practice of paying with checks has also become prevalent, leading to repeated cases of forging and altering payment orders and promissory notes. The police authorities have repeatedly solved cases and arrested criminals for prosecution. It has been learned that the Laochang Precinct has cracked another major case involving a criminal who defrauded over 20 million with bad checks. The victims number over dozens of families. The criminals Li Afu, Qu Da, Xu Min, and others have been successively arrested and brought to justice. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Using Dance Hostesses to Pose as Wealthy Patrons</p>
<p>The criminals Li Afu, Qu Da, Xu Min, and others had previously been sentenced for crimes such as kidnapping. After being released from prison, they had nothing to do, so they rented Room 21 in the Xindu Apartment on Nanchang Road, intending to use bad checks to defraud property. Therefore, they opened current accounts at the Mianbu Bank and Baoyuan Qianzhuang respectively, obtaining three checkbooks. They indiscriminately wrote checks for purchases and meals outside. The dance hostesses Wang Dehua, Gao Qiuxia, and Zheng Xuefang of the Dahuhu Dance Hall also rented Room 22 next door. They became acquainted when Wang and others played the harmonica and they harmonized. They were then lured in every way into their scheme. On July 11th, Li Afu, Qu Da, and Xu Min, along with the three dance hostesses Wang, Gao, and Zheng, went from the Xindu Apartment to the Dahua Cafe for coffee. After drinking, they paid with a check. Then they went to the Kangle Restaurant for dinner, and then to the Yiwentai Nightclub for dancing. Finally, they rented a room at the Xiangsheng Hotel and paid with checks.</p>
<p>Riding Around in a Car to Swindle Goods</p>
<p>At about 7:00 AM the next morning, they hired a car from the Yunfei Car Company to drive around. First, they went to Guohua and bought peaches with a check outside the Guohua Temple. Then they ordered the driver to return to Shanghai, to the Daxin Department Store on Luoyang Road, where they bought Hong Kong shirts and women's cosmetics worth over 600,000 yuan with a check. They then got back in the car and went to the Rongkang Sihouse on Huashan Road for a meal. Then they went to the Jinhu Shoe Company on Zhengyang Road and bought five pairs of women's leather shoes. They went to the Wanchang Raincoat Company in Xieqiao Alley and bought eight raincoats, worth over 2 million yuan. They then went to the Jinmen Clothing Company and bought three coats. Then they went to the Huamei Hotel on the Bund and rented rooms but did nothing. Then they rented Room 338 at the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road and put all the items in the room. They then got in the car and went to Hengdeli to buy three watches, worth 1.85 million yuan. All of the above were paid for with checks. At about 4:00 PM, they went to the Xinya Restaurant for a meal. On the spot, they gave the driver a check for 530,000 yuan for the car rental and a small check for 180,000 yuan and ordered him to leave. At the Xinya, the bill was 133,720 yuan. Li Afu then wrote a check for 150,000 yuan from the Baoyuan Qianzhuang, which was rejected, leading to a conflict. Li Afu and Xu Min saw that the situation was not good and first fled with Gao Qiuxia and Zheng Xuefang. The waiter of the Sihouse reported to the accounting room, who held Qu Da and Wang Dehua and reported to the Laochang Precinct. The director of the third unit ordered police officer Zhang Guodong, police sergeant Liu Zongtong, and Shen Zhiming to investigate. They confessed the details and investigated in all directions. They arrested the remaining criminals Li Afu and Xu Min, and the exploited dance hostesses Gao Qiuxia and Zheng Xuefang, at No. 565, Dajiangnan Hotel, and confiscated all the items they had swindled that day.</p>
<p>Victimized Businesses Report to the Precinct</p>
<p>Li confessed that he had used bad checks to defraud not only the above-mentioned stores, but also the Dianzi Store, Xinxin No. 1 Building, Nanguo, Central Western Clothing Store, Jinmen Hotel, Gaoshiman Dance Hall, Laozhengdian Restaurant, bathhouse, and Yangliu, Taotao, Xinmingming, Night Club, Sanle, and No. 1 Dance Hostess Agency on Jingansi Road, totaling over 20 million yuan. The Precinct hopes that all victimized companies, businesses, and stores that have received bad checks with the account names "Li Afu" "Li Guanglie" of the Baoyuan Qianzhuang and "Xie Wenche" of the Mianbu Bank, will report to the third unit of the Precinct for closing the case.</p>
<h3>Early Opening of Dance Halls Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau's regulations for dance hall operating hours are from 5:00 PM to 11:30 PM daily (5:00 PM to 7:00 PM for tea dances, 8:00 PM to 11:30 PM for evening dances). However, recently some dance halls have disregarded the law and opened early, holding tea dances from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is unacceptable. Therefore, the Second Administrative Section has ordered the prohibition of tea dances. Violators will be severely punished, and branch bureaus will be responsible for enforcement. Dancing is also prohibited in cafes during the aforementioned hours.</p>
<p>New Police Chief Takes Office at Penglai Bureau</p>
<p>Ge Hanyi, the newly appointed chief of the Penglai Road Police Bureau, formally took office yesterday morning. After completing the handover, he convened a meeting with the heads of various sections and all police officers for an address.</p>
<h3>School Principal Punished for Fraudulently Receiving Special Rice Allotments</h3>
<p>Yang Yaqiu, the principal of Qin Zhi Private Elementary School on Liyuan Road in the Nanshi district, used the alias Yang Zhiying to falsely report the number of teachers and fraudulently receive special rice allotments. She also embezzled and withheld the teachers' special and fair-price rice. After the school's teachers Yuan Xiuying and Li Juemin reported her to the Education Bureau, the principal retaliated by falsely accusing teacher Li Juemin in the Shanghai Local Court. Upon learning of this situation, the Education Bureau immediately sent personnel for a secret investigation and reported it to the Municipal Government. An order was issued to discipline the principal. The Education Bureau has now ordered the school's board of directors to remove Principal Yang Yaqiu to rectify the school's atmosphere. Simultaneously, the principal is strictly limited to returning the fraudulently obtained rice allotments directly to the Economic Bureau. Regarding the embezzlement of special and fair-price rice and other disciplinary issues at the school, the board of directors is ordered to handle the matter appropriately and carry out strict rectification.</p>
<h3>Banks and Financial Firms to Standardize Next-Day Clearing for Customer Checks</h3>
<p>Member banks and financial firms in the city had previously proposed implementing next-day clearing for checks due to the increasing volume of checks received, making exchange and transfer procedures difficult. However, financial firms expressed disagreement, and the matter was dropped. It has now been learned that both banks and financial firms are generally using next-day clearing for all customer checks, and some firms have notified customers that the banking and financial industries will uniformly implement this practice starting on the 20th of this month. Regarding the matter of customers depositing checks on the current day but receiving next-day clearing, reporters inquired with banks and financial firms for details. It was reported that many firms have already automatically implemented next-day clearing, especially those in the downtown area, and have been doing so for quite some time. Therefore, the banking and financial industries are actively considering the uniform implementation of this practice, which is expected to be realized soon. The alleged date of the 20th has not yet been formally announced by the banking and financial industries. This next-day clearing effectively means that checks received on the current day are exchanged the next day.</p>
<p>Statistics on Check Clearing for Last Month</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the city's banking industry recently released the total figures for interbank exchange and collection of checks for the month from June 1st to June 30th of this year: Exchange of checks: 497,663,815,100.00. Collection of checks: (A) Paid by exchange banks: 327,338,142,700.00. (B) Paid by foreign banks: 105,933,184,300.00. (C) Paid by correspondent banks: 266,266,988,872.15. Total: 699,538,315,872.15. Grand total: 1,197,202,130,972.15. Previously, the Bank Association's collection of checks included figures for payments made by member financial firms, but since June, these have been handled independently by the financial firms' treasury, so the Association's usual figures have been removed.</p>
<h3>Prices of Tooth Powder and Cotton Fluff Approved</h3>
<p>The city's Price Evaluation Committee continued to approve the prices of tooth powder and cotton fluff. The price of "Invincible" brand facial tooth powder (50cc) is set at 200 yuan per package, and the price of cotton, including fluffing labor, is set at 12,000 yuan per market catty. In addition to instructing the relevant industries to strictly comply, the Committee has also sent a letter to the Fourth Division of the Police Bureau, instructing all squads to strictly enforce these prices.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Distributed to City and County Police</h3>
<p>The city's Liaison Office, to encourage the service spirit of police officers in various counties, repeatedly requested monthly cigarette allocations from the Japanese Embassy in its capacity as a liaison office. After repeated efforts, this has been approved. It has been learned that the cigarettes allocated for June are of the "Tongfu" brand, totaling 450,000 cigarettes. The head of the Liaison Office's Shimizu section recently informed the County Government Management Office, which consulted with the Municipal Government's General Affairs Section to advance the allocation price of 1,260,000 yuan and transportation costs of 30,000 yuan for retrieval. The average value of each cigarette is 2 yuan and 87 fen. After allocating 150 cigarettes per person to the county police officers according to the Liaison Office's original list (a total of 371,250 cigarettes for the seven county police bureaus), there is a surplus of 78,750 cigarettes. With the approval of the County Management Office and the Municipal Government, these will be evenly distributed to the staff of each county government, with an average allocation of 32,287 cigarettes per county. The County Management Office has issued orders to the county governments and police bureaus, instructing them to quickly prepare funds, send personnel to the Municipal Government to collect the cigarettes for distribution, and strictly prohibiting any deductions.</p>
<h3>Stores Fined for Not Filling Out Special Tax Invoices</h3>
<p>Many stores in the city have failed to comply with the regulations set by the Finance Bureau regarding the use of invoices for collecting special consumption taxes. Over 640 stores have been investigated and punished by the Finance Bureau. The Bureau's Supervisory Section has again sent personnel to investigate whether stores are using invoices as required. As a result, 30 stores, including Yuan Dachang Tobacco Shop at 128 Hubei Road, were found to have purchased special tax invoices but were not issuing them to customers, suggesting intentional tax evasion. In addition, 20 stores, including Kaili Company at 755 Jing'an Temple Road, were using self-printed invoices that had not been stamped by the Bureau, which also violated regulations. The Finance Bureau has imposed penalties on all of the above stores according to the severity of the violations.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market Report</h3>
<p>After the opening of the gold securities market yesterday, it continued to rise, following the upward trend of the previous day. The rise weakened in the middle of the day, but the closing price was still higher than the previous day. Prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Due Bills: 5,600,000 yuan, up 730,000 yuan from the previous day. Series IV Bills: 5,650,000 yuan, up 750,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>

<p>Xiangsheng Raincoat Factory Product: The BHB Bianma Brand raincoat has been around for a long time, and its excellent quality has earned it a solid reputation, so it sells well throughout the country, and Shanghai ladies especially like to wear it, which is very much in line with economic principles.</p>
<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3>Six Thousand Children of New and Returning Applicants Desperately Await Assistance</h3>
<p>We Hope That Enthusiastic People Will Quickly Extend a Helping Hand</p>
<p>Our newspaper's reader scholarship program has helped many, with over 3,700 students receiving assistance last session. These were returning students from the seventh session. At that time, new students from various schools applied for assistance, but our newspaper, due to the limited donations from all sectors of society, which were insufficient for distribution, rejected the new students' applications. This was a helpless matter! However, we always felt that not accepting new students was unreasonable and unbearable. Therefore, this session, in addition to issuing application forms to returning students as usual, we also issued application forms to new students through various levels of schools, carefully selecting impoverished and outstanding students, earnestly recommending them, and then rigorously screening them at our office to select the most academically outstanding to be admitted as recipients for this session. In recent days, returning students have been enthusiastically coming to the office to collect application forms, and new students have also been coming one after another, represented by their schools. It appears that these 6,000 children all have hopes of receiving scholarship money. Even after the qualifying examination, many, whether new or returning students, will be eliminated. This completely depends on their own academic performance for good fortune. Fortunately, the qualifying examination is extremely fair and impartial; so many with true talent and practical skills absolutely need not worry!</p>
<p>In fact, what is worth worrying about is the donations for this session's scholarship money. There has been no improvement in the past ten days. We do not know why the enthusiastic and powerful philanthropists are still late in coming, and the recognized donations are few. Gentlemen and ladies: These 6,000 children are like little birds on branches, desperately awaiting food. The situation is extremely urgent. We hope that enthusiastic philanthropists will quickly extend a helping hand, providing material relief, so that their thirst for knowledge will not suffer an unexpected famine!</p>

<h3>Measures for Issuing License Plates for Private Motor Vehicles</h3>
<p>To encourage wartime conservation, the former Municipal Public Works Bureau had already restricted the registration of motor vehicles. Since the establishment of the Municipal Construction Bureau, many citizens have been unclear about the regulations. Therefore, the Bureau has coordinated with relevant parties to formulate interim measures for issuing license plates and permits for private motor vehicles, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Bombed Area in Northeast Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Qi Chang</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, more than sixty enemy aircraft invaded the airspace over our city, indiscriminately bombing. This air raid can be said to be the one that has caused the most suffering to civilians. Northeast Shanghai was especially affected. Several streets were hit.</p>
<p>The number of casualties has not yet been tallied. In addition to those transported by the Pushan Mountain Villa, there are hundreds of seriously injured people who were transported to hospitals such as Housheng Hospital. When the reporter inspected the disaster area, there were still dozens of corpses lined up on the sidewalks, waiting for their relatives to come and claim them.</p>
<p>At a certain intersection, there were many food stalls, snack stalls, pancake stalls, and fruit stalls. It was lunchtime, and some laborers were having lunch or taking a short break. However, the bomb fell right there, and they all perished together. Dozens of people died in this way.</p>
<p>Almost all of the casualties were civilians. The areas affected were mostly shops and residences. From the broken signs, one can still vaguely make out tobacco and paper shops, shoe and hat shops, grocery stores, and so on. Just a short time ago, this was a bustling and prosperous street, but now it is filled with smoke, and the buildings are dilapidated and beyond repair.</p>
<p>In addition to a bloody corpse on the road, there were also large patches of thick blood stains, trampled by people, buried under rubble and wood. It is unknown how many people were buried alive. Those near the sidewalk were easier to find. The reporter saw a person being pulled from a pile of bricks four hours after the incident. The injuries were not very serious, but if he had been discovered earlier, he might not have died!</p>
<p>Chinese and Jewish relief workers were working hard, running on the roads filled with fire and rubble, bravely carrying out rescue work. The injured were lying on trucks, rickshaws, and stretchers, being sent to various places for emergency treatment. The empty stretchers were almost all covered with bloodstains, and in some cases, large patches of blood were still shaking on the canvas.</p>
<p>Many entire families probably died in this air raid. Someone heard that this area had been bombed and made a special trip to visit a relative, but when this person finally managed to identify the family's location, they only saw broken bricks and rubble. They asked the people next door and learned that two seriously injured people from the family had been sent to a hospital.</p>
<p>Given the severity and scope of the disaster caused by this air raid, we feel that it is necessary to strengthen the dissemination of air raid prevention knowledge, provide technical training in disaster relief and rescue, and provide extensive relief to the victims of the disaster area. What is especially important is that we hope that citizens will quickly evacuate to avoid unnecessary casualties and losses.</p>
