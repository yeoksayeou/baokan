<p>南京三十日中央社電　日大使館岸情報部長，頃為中央電訊社成立五週年紀念，特撰「日本和中國」一文，見解精闢獨認，並可供關心中日問題者之參考，原文如下：日本永遠存在於中國的隣居，故中國的命遝，和日本有不可解的關係。中國可用其主觀漢視日本，輕親日本，但在客觀上，決不能否定日本的存在，所以不管其愛好或憎惡日本，不問其為抗戰派或和平派，眞關心祖國命運的中國人，非知道日本的眞相不可，更非知道日本的力量·日本的動向以及日本的傳統不可。同時更當以「日本應該怎麼樣」的一個問題，和自國的命運邊帶者察，不時對日本陳述意見。</p>
<p>民族自覺理解日本</p>
<p>普遍地說，喪失了自巴本來面目，墮入英美的思想範　，而莫能自拔的中國人，常把日本的力量　得過小，又在帝國主義支配下，本來的自由精神被歪曲了的賈辦的頭腦，則以為沿歷史前進的日本動向，僅為因戰敗而採取的讓步，又以忽視祖國光耀傳統價値的盲目英美式思想，必不能理解日本優美的傳統。凡人一經喪失自已的主體性，便失去測定對象的能力，因為測定的標準當是自已本身，故欲理解日本，不論為敵為友，中國人的確立自已的主體性，當為先決條件·換言之，民族自覺的恢復，當為必要條件，這是僅是單單的知識程序的問題，而為嚴肅的民族自覺的道義的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c7">日本與中國的關係 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>－岸情報部長發表論文－</p>
<p>認識錯誤變換政策</p>
<p>本人是日本人，所以說這話，一方面也是因為我們日本人對於中國，也犯了頂大的認識錯誤，此種重大的認識錯誤，實為中日事變至今未能全面解決的根本理由。但日本現正一步一步反省，心理上巳有了重大的革命，由七七事變當時的認號「　懲　支」「滅黨」「勦共」等，以迄今日的「同生共死」，其乃日本的對華政策一再變更，終於達到了前年的所謂對華新政策這個萬古不易的大道。但重慶政權（即抗戰陣營）其國策却一貫不動，他們不動的國策，就是欲訴諸英美的軍事力及經濟力，打倒日本，因抱定以軍事力量，解決中日的思想，日本雖已覺悟其謬誤，抗戰中國卻迷夢未醒，有生命力者常變化，不變化及不能變化，實是生命力枯死之意</p>
<p>日本對華不存憎惡</p>
<p>日本以及中國的和運同志，經此戰爭而自巴反省·更經反省而相與提携，至少日本對於中國及中國人，不問其為抗戰派或和平派，悉抱敬愛及同情，決無憎惡之感。當然在若干偶發的現象中，中國人或將舉出日本人依然故我的實例，其實即在歌舞昇平時代，這也不應出此的。我們不能拘泥於枝節的事實，全體的日本人以及其凝固形式的日本國家意志，對中國人及中國，斷然沒有英美或蘇聯對德國所抱的憎惡，也不能右此憎惡的。現在歐洲方面所謂解放諸國的悲慘現狀，在和平區稱之日淪陷區或被佔領區，那裏的英美人，沒有溫厚的人間情惑，有的僅是物質慾望和復仇心理而已。又他們的戰鬥形態，是怎樣的呢？在湖南作戰下，被日軍所俘獲的方先覺將軍，不是依照其自由意志而歸返抗戰區了嗎？此種實例，實為我人作戰乃「人類之戰」的證明。</p>
<p>東方精神發揚光大</p>
<p>中國人和日本人都有其偉大的光榮感，此光榮感是足以成神的光榮感，日太有八百萬神位，其中有許多是在地上度一生，靖國神社的各種皆和我們一樣，享生於此時代的平凡國民。中國的神中，本人所知者亦多，為忠臣義士，孝子烈婦，此輩天神於其人間生活中，當已嘗盡了許多苦惱，淸高强力的人生者，便被尊祭為神，不論是敵是友，不能作野獸之鬥，我們深感東亞人在不能作為朋友握手，作為敵人而戰鬥之時，仍能以人類的感情而戰，為極大的光榮與欣慰，最後希望此文能有機會和重慶人士見面。</p>

<h3 id="c20">舊金山會議與近東問題 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>正在舉行的舊金山會議，以波闌問題為中心而表面化的英美蘇之間的衝突，成為會議開幕前最辛辣的諷刺劇，預料在會議中，必更有若干幕悲喜劇演出，而其內幕則無非由於英美蘇聯間戰後利權的爭奪罷了。從歐洲問題到太平洋問題，三國間之矛盾重重，吾人已歷有評論，即如過去未受注意的近東問題，最近也成為英美蘇聯衝突的新火藥庫了。近東問題的焦點，當然是英蘇美蘇乃至英美之間的利權爭奪。</p>
<p>蘇聯的企圖，是他們一向所不自諱言的，在求於隣接蘇聯國境諸國家諸地區，消除反蘇聯的勢力，進一步而造成對蘇聯友善的勢力。在這種基本方針之下，就第二次大戰以來的蘇芬戰爭與交涉，波羅的海沿岸愛立拉三小國蘇維埃政權的成立，波蘭親蘇政權的成立，乃至去年以來巴爾幹半島諸國的變色。隨着歐洲戰局的急轉直下，蘇聯的安定邊　政策也可由西而甫，轉其目光於近東，首先是土耳其，其次是伊朗等國。最近蘇土　約的宣吿廢止，一海峽開放的澈底實現，乃至伊朗伊拉克石油爭奪戰的激化，都是一貫方針。</p>
<p>英美兩國的近東政策顯與蘇聯相對立的。其中特別是央國，一涉折東問題，就一定站在和蘇聯對立的地位。不只是二次世界大戰以來，就遠在十九世紀，俄英之間，已為此而不斷發生糾紛，不知流過幾千幾萬人的血！誠如朝日新聞社論所指出：每當俄國國勢弱化的時期，他就要求封鎖黑海，而英國則要求開放；反之，俄國國勢强盛之時，則就要求開放黑海，而英國則堅決反對；介乎其間的土耳其則無論在何塲合，都不免被牽入戰過。這僅就海峽問題上英蘇兩國的矛眉而已。此外，英國為了保持對東方殖民地特別是英印之間的連絡，對於蘇彝士運河一帶，必須保持其獨占權，從埃及到阿剌伯，不容他人染指，但是現在由於巴爾幹局面的大轉變，蘇聯勢力已面臨東地中海，對埃及和阿刺伯的活動也日趨積極，顯有直接威脅英國東方殖民地霸權的趨勢，這又是英蘇以近東問題而對立的新因素。</p>
<p>美國對於近東的活動，主要的是由這次世界大戰才開始的，為着作戰上的要求，美國要求利用近東若干軍事基地，更要求利用近東主要資源如石油等等；為了物資援蘇，美國的勢力又漸入伊朗；在共同作戰的要求上，英蘇都同意美國勢力向折東伸展，但是當戰局開始轉變，共同作戰的意義退居第二位以後，英蘇兩國都開始不滿於美國勢力的過度伸展了。因此，自去年開始，以伊朗和伊拉克的石油租用權為中心，形成了日趨嚴重的三國糾紛。蘇美之間以伊朗油權問題而相持不下，致使狹持中的伊朗政局杌隉不安；英美之間也以伊拉克油田問題而發生爭執；加以美國為深入近東計，曾有所謂回敎徒建國方案提出，而英國就策動了一個泛阿刺伯大聯盟進行反擊。</p>
<p>最不幸的要算是三強互爭下的近東諸國了，土耳其態度之再三轉變，伊朗內閣的不斷改組，埃及最近發生的血案，阿刺伯·　利亞·黎巴嫩等之對軸心國宣戰，乃至伊拉克政局的不安等等，無一不是英美蘇聯在近東爭霸的反映。然而，這不是結果，還只是近東大變局的序幕，舊金山會議以後的近東乃至其他各地的變局，勢將接踵而起呢。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3 id="c21">近東命動與英蘇兩國 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>由於歐洲新近形勢的急轉直下，而近東的形勢也進入新階段了。在英美蘇看來，近東問題的解決方式，與歐洲問題相同，是非常複雜微妙的。但在歐洲問題急需解決的形勢下，近東問題就一直到今天似乎任其自然發展一樣無人過問，現在竟表面化了。近東的中心就是土耳其。土耳其由於近來英美的壓迫，放棄了多年的機會主義中立政策，加入了反軸心陣營，終於對軸心國宣戰。然而問題並不在於土耳其單單表示一下反軸心的態度，就天下太平，這是人所共知的。土耳其由於反軸心色彩逐漸濃厚，於是便發生投向英美蘇那一國懷抱的問題。在這一點上，土耳其仍然繼續其機會主義態度，它一面與英國保持着同盟關係，而一面與蘇聯具有友好中立條約，藉此想在英蘇勢力均衡上以求自身之安全保障。但蘇聯對於這種局面突然用一塊敲門磚打碎了。就是說，蘇聯於三月二十一日曾向土耳其聲明廢棄蘇土中立條約了。理由就是因為第二次世界大戰形勢所發生的極大變化，中立條約早已無法適應新的局面，所以不得不有所變動。總之，這就是證明蘇聯想要重新調整蘇土邦交。</p>
<p>蘇聯的言論宣傳機關，前此曾一口咬定土耳其的現行政權為反民主主義者，並痛詆為具有法西斯傾向者，事實上土耳其的現行政權，在目前日益　上親英美的色彩，看到這一點，也可以推斷蘇聯的意圖。</p>
<p>蘇聯名交政策主要原則之一，固然是企圖使周圍各國與蘇聯建立親蘇政權，現在仍然根據這種意圖拼命工作。旣如此，即按地理關係上說，土耳其之成為蘇聯工作對象，也決不會例外。何況土耳其控制着被關閉着的黑海至氣候與風景俱佳的地中海之出口達達納爾海峽，自然蘇聯對土耳其的關心，不是從今日始才極端濃厚的。在另一方面，自然也很明白，沒落的英國只要仍想維持大英帝國的生命綫，則決不會同意把土耳其和達達納爾海峽全部交給蘇聯宰割。這一點，請看整個十九世紀因達達納爾海峽而發生的不斷英俄戰爭，是如何熾烈，也可以明瞭。</p>
<p>當俄國勢力衰弱時，俄國則希望封鎖達達納爾海峽，英國則希望開放。反之，俄國勢力膨脹時，則俄國希望開放該海峽，以求本國勢力的出口。今日在遙一方面，英國和蘇聯都有此其他國家更多的發言權，且都在膨脹着自己的勢力，這是不言而喩的事實。假如蘇聯取得由黑海至愛琴海的出口，則可斷定英國將有無限畏懼和憂慮。所以因土耳其而發生的英蘇外交戰，將逐漸明朗化。在此也深深地表現出英蘇兩國的矛盾。（譯自朝日新聞社評）</p>

<p>日大本營於三十日發表西太平洋各方面之戰績，謂擊沉敵方艦船約八十艘，（中有擊破者）由是以觀，自琉球方面開始戰鬥以來，海面所獲綜合戰績，至偉且大，蓋敵方艦船有四百七十艘以上，被擊沉及擊破者。關於此事，駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，特發表其見解如左：</p>
<p>敵方艦艇八成損害</p>
<p>四月三十日，日大本營所發表之戰績足以證實日軍由本土遠征赤道以南阿德密拉堤羣島，在二千哩個這水域展開偉大作戰。因此次之發表，始知琉球方面，自戰鬥開始以來，敵方艦船之損害，實達四百七十艘之多，而其大部分為戰鬥所用之艦艇，故可推定太平洋方面敵方用以戰鬥之艦艇約有八成已蒙損害。惟太平洋之戰爭與歐洲方面之戰爭不同，綠海上勢力厥為首要條件，故敵方之艦船部隊，旣已蒙受重大損害，不管其歐洲方面之戰况如何，此後欲在太平洋方面火速而且圓滑推行作戰，誠恐事有不可能。</p>
<p>企圖挽回陸上頹勢</p>
<p>敵方旣在海面損失莫大兵力，今欲在陸地挽回戰勢，故自四月十九日以來，頓起蠢動，直攻琉球島南方日軍堅陣，但其進攻遲遲不進，屢受日本陸軍阻止，以致損失莫大兵員。再敵方希圖消滅日本本土之航空部隊勢力，乃調動B29型重轟炸機，由馬里亞納諸島來炸，大有不絕如縷之勢，蓋日本航空部隊絕不因敵方B29型之轟炸而受損害，而今依舊出動琉球方面，大舉攻擊敵方艦船，其戰績赫赫可觀。</p>

<p>民族丁茲世界戰局轉換之時，益加淬勵，決意追擊敵美與敵英，期我東亞盟邦諸民族與日本密切携手，忍受一切困難，增強戰力，以期解放東亞民族，此乃吾等之光榮。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon: Results of Okinawa Island Battle; Army, Navy, and Air Force Units Inflict Heavy Damage on the Enemy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 30th: Since April 29th, the enemy forces have attacked the southern region of Okinawa Island multiple times. Although they have made some advances, each time they have suffered significant damage from Japanese forces and continue to fight fiercely. From the time of the enemy landing until April 28th, the battle results obtained by the Japanese forces in that area, as confirmed, are as follows: Approximately 183,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 294 tanks grounded and destroyed by fire, 102 vehicles destroyed, 65 various artillery pieces destroyed, 26 ammunition and food depots destroyed by bombing, and 97 aircraft shot down or destroyed. Our air units have continued to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and enemy ships and mobile units off the coast of the island, especially the continuous fierce attacks since April 27th, inflicting great losses on the enemy. Among the battle results obtained by our side, those confirmed by April 18th are as follows: One battleship or cruiser sunk, four cruisers sunk, two transport ships sunk, one oil tanker sunk, and fifteen ships of unknown type sunk (two of which are believed to be aircraft carriers). One auxiliary aircraft carrier destroyed, five battleships damaged, three battleships or cruisers damaged, five cruisers damaged, three destroyers damaged, one large warship damaged, five transport ships damaged, sixteen ships of unknown type damaged, and twenty-one military facilities burned or destroyed. Most of the air units participating in the above attacks were special attack units. Since April 15th, until the 27th, Japanese naval special attack units have launched special attacks on enemy ships around Okinawa Island, with the following results: Two destroyers sunk, three transport ships sunk, two large warships sunk, and one ship of unknown type sunk. The "Kamishio" special attack unit attacked an enemy transport convoy heading north in the waters south of Okinawa Island on the morning of April 27th, sinking four of its ships. On the night of April 27th, Japanese air units attacked enemy ships anchored in the Admiralty Islands, sinking one auxiliary aircraft carrier.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Decisive Battle in Ryukyu Imminent <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Because the weather has recovered, Japanese air units have begun large-scale operations since the 27th, desperately attacking enemy ships and enemy airfields and land positions around Ryukyu. The special attack units directly charged enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in rapid succession, with unstoppable courage. As a result, flames soared along the coast, and the enemy fleet was in great confusion. The enemy is feeling great pain from the attacks from the Ryukyu area. The battle has now reached its climax. Japanese special attack aircraft are continuously advancing to grasp the enemy's warships and warplanes. At this crucial moment, it is up to the one hundred million people in the rear. How they produce special attack aircraft greatly affects the progress of the war. The decisive battle in Ryukyu is indeed imminent.</p>
<p>Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Daytime Attacks</p>
<p>From a certain Japanese base, 30th (Central News Agency) – Japanese attacks on enemy mobile units around Okinawa have become more intense since the weather improved. On the auspicious day of the Emperor's Birthday, the 29th, Japanese special attack units launched daytime attacks, sinking or destroying four enemy aircraft carriers and four or more escort aircraft carrier-type ships. The enemy's resistance to this Japanese air attack was very weak, which is worthy of serious attention. In addition, it was confirmed that Japanese aircraft rammed enemy cruisers. Also, in the attacks from the 29th to the morning of the 30th, five enemy ships of unknown type caught fire, one of which sank after catching fire. Operations are still in progress, and the battle results are gradually expanding. At the same time, the Japanese special attack units attacking enemy ships in Kadena hit one cruiser around 1:00 AM on the 30th, causing it to catch fire. At approximately 1:40 AM, one large warship and one small warship also caught fire.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from Guam states that Nimitz Headquarters announced in a communiqué on the 29th that approximately 200 Japanese aircraft launched a large-scale attack on US naval forces in the Okinawa area from the daytime of April 28th to the 29th, causing significant damage.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Kanto Region Attacked Twice Yesterday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Since the 26th, enemy air forces from southern bases have continued to attack Japanese air bases in southern Kyushu. On the 30th, they turned their attack to the Kanto region, bombing Japanese aviation facilities near Tachikawa. The total number of aircraft attacking that day was approximately 200, consisting of approximately 100 B-29s and approximately 100 P-51s, divided into two waves. The first wave, consisting of approximately 80 B-29s formed into ten teams, entered the mainland at approximately 10:00 AM, passing near Shimoda, then over Fujisawa and Ishikozuki, and reaching Tachikawa, where they bombed aviation facilities. Then, they turned left and flew towards Suruga Bay. The second wave, consisting of approximately 20 B-29s and approximately 100 P-51s, jointly bombed Tachikawa, following roughly the same route as the first wave. The P-51s strafed the areas near Hiratsuka and Atsugi with machine guns and flew towards Sagami Bay at approximately 11:00 AM. Prior to this, one or two B-29s flew to the Kanto region around 8:00 AM to conduct reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Taipei, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the daytime of the 28th, approximately 35 enemy bombers and several fighter planes, which took off from bases in the Philippines, attacked the Kaohsiung and Tainan areas, dropping bombs near Okayama before fleeing. At around midnight, two enemy large aircraft intruded into the vicinity of Tainan and dropped bombs. Japanese damage was minor.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Hu Yukun Goes to Beijing to Take Office <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Beiping, 30th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Chief of General Staff, Mr. Hu Yukun, took a train to Beijing on the 30th to take office. The heads of various agencies here went to the station to see him off.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kishi, Chief of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy, recently wrote an article entitled "Japan and China" for the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central News Agency. His insights are insightful and unique, and can be used as a reference for those who are concerned about Sino-Japanese issues. The original text is as follows: Japan will always exist as China's neighbor, so China's destiny is inextricably linked to Japan. China can view Japan from its subjective Chinese perspective and take Japan lightly, but objectively, it cannot deny the existence of Japan. Therefore, regardless of whether one loves or hates Japan, regardless of whether one is in the resistance faction or the peace faction, Chinese people who are truly concerned about the fate of their motherland must know the truth about Japan, and must know Japan's strength, Japan's trends, and Japan's traditions. At the same time, they should also examine the question of "what should Japan be like" and the fate of their own country, and constantly express their opinions to Japan.</p>
<p>National Self-Awareness and Understanding of Japan</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chinese people who have lost their original appearance, fallen into the ideological framework of Britain and the United States, and are unable to extricate themselves, often underestimate Japan's strength. Furthermore, those with minds distorted by imperialism, whose original spirit of freedom has been perverted, believe that Japan's movements along the path of history are merely concessions taken as a result of defeat. Furthermore, with a blind Anglo-American style of thinking that ignores the glorious traditional values ​​of their motherland, they will certainly not be able to understand Japan's beautiful traditions. Once a person loses his subjectivity, he loses the ability to measure the object, because the standard of measurement must be oneself. Therefore, in order to understand Japan, whether as an enemy or a friend, the establishment of one's own subjectivity by Chinese people must be a prerequisite. In other words, the restoration of national self-awareness must be a necessary condition. This is not merely a matter of a knowledge procedure, but a serious matter of morality for national self-awareness.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Relationship between Japan and China <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>-Intelligence Chief Kishi Publishes Essay-</p>
<p>Policy Changes Due to Misunderstanding</p>
<p>I am Japanese, so I say this, on the one hand, also because we Japanese have made the biggest mistakes in understanding China. This serious misunderstanding is the fundamental reason why the Sino-Japanese Incident has not been fully resolved to this day. However, Japan is now reflecting step by step, and there has been a major psychological revolution. From the recognition of "punishing the Zhi," "destroying the party," and "suppressing the Communists" at the time of the July 7th Incident to today's "coexistence and co-prosperity," Japan's policy toward China has repeatedly changed, and finally reached the so-called New Policy toward China of the previous year, which is a great way that will never change. However, the Chongqing regime (i.e., the resistance camp) has consistently maintained its national policy. Their unchanging national policy is to appeal to the military and economic power of Britain and the United States to defeat Japan. Because they are determined to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict through military force, Japan has realized its fallacy, but resistance China has not yet awakened from its dream. Those with vitality often change, while those who do not change or cannot change are in fact dead in vitality.</p>
<p>Japan Does Not Hate China</p>
<p>Japan and China's fellow travelers in harmony, through this war, will reflect on themselves from their original selves, and through further reflection, will carry each other along. At least Japan holds respect and sympathy for China and the Chinese people, regardless of whether they are in the resistance faction or the peace faction, and has no sense of hatred at all. Of course, in some occasional phenomena, the Chinese people may cite examples of Japanese people remaining the same, but in fact, even in times of peace and prosperity, this should not be ruled out. We cannot be obsessed with trivial facts. The entire Japanese people and the solidified form of the Japanese national will, towards China and the Chinese people, certainly do not have the hatred that Britain and the United States or the Soviet Union hold towards Germany, nor can they harbor this hatred. The tragic state of affairs in what is now called the liberated countries in Europe, which in the peaceful areas are called occupied or liberated areas, is that the British and Americans there have no mild human feelings, and only have material desires and a desire for revenge. Furthermore, what is their form of combat? General Fang Xianjue, who was captured by the Japanese army in the battle of Hunan, was not returned to the resistance area according to his free will? This example is proof that our war is a "war of humanity."</p>
<p>Promote the Eastern Spirit</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese people both have a great sense of glory, and this sense of glory is enough to become a god. There are eight million deities in Japan, many of whom spent their lives on earth. The various deities in Yasukuni Shrine are all ordinary citizens who lived in this era, just like us. Among the Chinese gods, I also know many, who are loyal officials, righteous men, filial sons, and virtuous women. These heavenly beings must have tasted many hardships in their human lives. Those with pure and powerful lives are revered as gods. Whether we are enemies or friends, we cannot fight like beasts. We deeply feel that it is a great honor and joy for East Asians to be able to fight with human feelings even when they cannot shake hands as friends and fight as enemies. Finally, I hope this article will have the opportunity to meet with people in Chongqing.</p>

<h3 id="e20">The San Francisco Conference and the Near East Question <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The ongoing San Francisco Conference, with the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over the Polish question becoming apparent, has turned into a bitter satire before the conference even opened. It is expected that several more tragicomedies will be performed during the conference, the essence of which is nothing more than the struggle between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for post-war interests. We have previously commented on the multiple contradictions between the three countries, from European issues to Pacific issues. Even the Near East question, which has not received much attention in the past, has recently become a new powder keg for conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The focus of the Near East question is, of course, the struggle for interests between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and even between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's intentions have always been openly stated: to eliminate anti-Soviet forces in countries and regions bordering the Soviet Union, and to further create forces friendly to the Soviet Union. Under this basic policy, since the Second World War, the Soviet-Finnish War and negotiations, the establishment of Soviet regimes in the three small Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the establishment of a pro-Soviet regime in Poland, and even the changes in the Balkan countries since last year have occurred. With the rapid turn of events in the European war situation, the Soviet Union's policy of stabilizing its borders can also shift from the west to the east, turning its attention to the Near East, first to Turkey, then to countries such as Iran. The recent declaration of the abolition of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty, the thorough realization of the opening of the Straits, and the intensification of the oil disputes in Iran and Iraq are all consistent with this policy.</p>
<p>The Near East policies of Britain and the United States are clearly opposed to those of the Soviet Union. In particular, Britain invariably stands in opposition to the Soviet Union when it comes to Near East issues. Not only since the Second World War, but as far back as the 19th century, Russia and Britain have been in constant conflict over this, shedding the blood of thousands upon thousands of people! As the Asahi Shimbun editorial pointed out: Whenever Russia's national power weakened, it demanded the closure of the Black Sea, while Britain demanded its opening; conversely, when Russia's national power was strong, it demanded the opening of the Black Sea, while Britain resolutely opposed it; Turkey, caught in the middle, was inevitably dragged into the war regardless of the situation. This only concerns the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Straits issue. In addition, in order to maintain its connection to its eastern colonies, especially British India, Britain must maintain its exclusive rights over the Suez Canal area, not allowing others to interfere from Egypt to Arabia. However, due to the major changes in the Balkan situation, Soviet power has now faced the Eastern Mediterranean, and its activities in Egypt and Arabia are becoming increasingly active, showing a trend of directly threatening Britain's hegemony over its eastern colonies. This is another new factor in the opposition between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Near East question.</p>
<p>The United States' activities in the Near East mainly began with the Second World War. For the sake of operations, the United States demanded the use of certain military bases in the Near East, and also demanded the use of key resources in the Near East, such as oil. For the sake of material aid to the Soviet Union, American power gradually entered Iran. On the demand of joint operations, Britain and the Soviet Union both agreed to the extension of American power to the Near East, but when the war situation began to change and the significance of joint operations receded, both Britain and the Soviet Union began to be dissatisfied with the excessive expansion of American power. Therefore, since last year, a growing dispute has formed among the three countries, centered on the oil concession rights in Iran and Iraq. The Soviet Union and the United States were at odds over the Iranian oil rights issue, causing instability in the beleaguered Iranian political situation; Britain and the United States also had disputes over the Iraqi oil fields; in addition, in order to deepen its involvement in the Near East, the United States proposed a so-called plan for the establishment of a Muslim state, while Britain launched a pan-Arab alliance to counter it.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing is the Near East countries under the contention of the three powers. Turkey's repeated changes in attitude, the constant reorganization of the Iranian cabinet, the recent bloodshed in Egypt, the declaration of war against the Axis powers by Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, etc., and the instability of the Iraqi political situation are all reflections of the struggle between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for hegemony in the Near East. However, this is not the end result, but only the prelude to a major change in the Near East. After the San Francisco Conference, changes in the Near East and other regions will follow one after another.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Dynamics of the Near East and the Two Powers, Britain and the Soviet Union <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Due to the recent rapid turn of events in Europe, the situation in the Near East has also entered a new stage. In the eyes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the way to resolve the Near East question, like the European question, is very complex and delicate. However, under the urgent need to resolve the European question, the Near East question has remained unattended until today, seemingly left to develop naturally. The center of the Near East is Turkey. Due to the recent pressure from Britain and the United States, Turkey abandoned its long-standing opportunistic neutral policy and joined the anti-Axis camp, finally declaring war on the Axis powers. However, the problem does not lie in Turkey simply expressing an anti-Axis attitude, and then everything will be fine, which is well known. As Turkey's anti-Axis stance gradually intensified, the question of which power, Britain, the United States, or the Soviet Union, it should turn to arose. On this point, Turkey continued its opportunistic attitude, maintaining an alliance relationship with Britain while having a friendly neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, thereby seeking its own security guarantee in the balance of power between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union suddenly shattered this situation with a "knocking brick." That is, the Soviet Union declared to Turkey on March 21 that it was abandoning the Soviet-Turkish Neutrality Treaty. The reason was that the great changes in the situation of World War II made the Neutrality Treaty unable to adapt to the new situation, so it had to be changed. In short, this proves that the Soviet Union wants to readjust Soviet-Turkish relations.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's propaganda machinery had previously asserted that Turkey's current administration was anti-democratic and strongly criticized it as having fascist tendencies. In fact, Turkey's current administration is increasingly pro-British and pro-American. Seeing this, one can also infer the Soviet Union's intentions.</p>
<p>One of the main principles of Soviet diplomacy is, of course, to try to establish pro-Soviet regimes in the surrounding countries, and it is still working hard according to this intention. Given this, and based on geographical relations, Turkey becoming a target of Soviet work will be no exception. Moreover, Turkey controls the Dardanelles Strait, the exit from the closed Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea with its pleasant climate and scenery. Naturally, the Soviet Union's concern for Turkey is not something that has only become extremely strong today. On the other hand, it is also very clear that the declining Britain, as long as it still wants to maintain the lifeline of the British Empire, will never agree to hand over Turkey and the Dardanelles Strait entirely to the Soviet Union for disposal. To understand this point, one need only look at how fierce the continuous Anglo-Russian wars over the Dardanelles Strait were throughout the 19th century.</p>
<p>When Russian power was weak, Russia hoped to block the Dardanelles Strait, while Britain hoped to open it. Conversely, when Russian power expanded, Russia hoped to open the Strait in order to seek an outlet for its power. Today, both Britain and the Soviet Union have more say than other countries in this regard, and both are expanding their power, which is a self-evident fact. If the Soviet Union obtains access from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, it can be concluded that Britain will have infinite fear and anxiety. Therefore, the Anglo-Soviet diplomatic war over Turkey will gradually become clear. This also deeply reveals the contradictions between Britain and the Soviet Union.

<h3 id="e22">Hoping Citizens Will Make Adequate Air Defense Preparations at All Times, Air Defense Headquarters Authorities Issue Statement <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters who spoke to reporters: "In recent days, enemy American planes have repeatedly invaded Shanghai. On the evening of the day before yesterday (28th), at around 11:00 PM, two enemy B-24 type (reported as B-29 type, actually incorrect) planes invaded Shanghai's airspace. Before they could drop their bombs, one plane was shot down by the Japanese air defense elite's artillery fire, and the other plane was wounded and fled in panic. The one that was shot down exploded in the air and shattered, falling into Pudong. The wreckage has been taken by military authorities and is on display at the entrance of the Continental Daily News (大陸新報社) at 17 The Bund, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>The City May Be Subject to Air Raids at Any Time</p>
<p>However, enemy planes have repeatedly attacked Shanghai in succession, and all of them have been at late nights, so Shanghai is at any time subject to the possibility of being air-raided. Therefore, it is necessary for citizens to make adequate air defense preparations at all times to cope with any eventuality, especially the light control regulations. They must strictly abide by these, and after nightfall, whether there is an air raid alarm or not, they must properly install curtains and door screens around the windows, absolutely preventing light from leaking out. Even when going to sleep, they must place clothing, air defense equipment, etc. in appropriate locations to avoid being caught off guard and causing danger. At the same time, attention must be paid to traffic control. After hearing the alarm, the Baojia (neighborhood watch) air defense personnel must all go out to assist the police in implementing traffic control and maintaining order, and guide the public into nearby air raid shelters or appropriate buildings. It is absolutely forbidden for the public to stand in the street to watch the bombing and artillery fire, to avoid being hit by stray bullets and causing unnecessary deaths and injuries. In short: Shanghai has now entered a state of being subject to air raids at any time. Citizens should always make various air defense preparations to ensure the safety of the people's property."</p>

<h3 id="e28">Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau Stipulates Inspection Measures for Hotels; Police Officers Must Show Identification Cards <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, due to its central location and concentration of public entertainment venues, is particularly strict with security. It has recently been found that some lawless elements are wearing uniforms and impersonating police officers, even claiming to be police officers from the Lao Zha Sub-bureau. They go to public places such as hotels under the guise of inspecting travelers and extort money through intimidation. They are lawless and do anything they want. The sub-bureau has received repeated reports, so it was decided at the bureau affairs meeting to summon the persons in charge of various public places such as hotels to talk and issue a public notice. In the future, if police officers go to various public places such as hotels to carry out inspection work, regardless of whether they are wearing uniforms or not, they must show their identification cards to the owner and carry out inspection duties together with the owner or a designated person in charge. Otherwise, the owners can refuse and report to the sub-bureau by telephone, and the sub-bureau will send police officers to thoroughly investigate the matter. If there are any criminals impersonating public officials, they will be taken to the bureau and severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>Reiterating the Ban on Operating Past Hours</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the sub-bureau has recently found that entertainment venues are often operating past the allowed hours. Moreover, travelers in various hotels are still gambling and engaging in prostitution, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, the previous order has been reiterated, ordering various entertainment venues to strictly comply with the operating hours stipulated by the authorities and absolutely not to operate past the allowed hours. Various hotels and apartments must also operate on time, and after the stipulated time, hotels must absolutely not engage in gambling or prostitution in order to adapt to the wartime system. Those who dare to deliberately violate the regulations, whether they are owners or travelers, will be punished according to law. The Second Section is ordered to send police officers to various public places at any time to investigate and supervise.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Enemy Fleet Suffers Heavy Damage Off the Ryukyus, Enemy Troops Have Difficulty Operating, Minister Matsushima Expresses Views <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of battles on various fronts in the Western Pacific on the 30th, stating that approximately 80 enemy ships were sunk (some were damaged). From this, it can be seen that since the start of the battle off the Ryukyus, the overall results obtained on the sea surface have been very great. More than 470 enemy ships have been sunk or damaged. Regarding this matter, Colonel Matsushima, the press chief of the Fleet in China, expressed his views as follows:</p>
<p>Eighty Percent of Enemy Ships Damaged</p>
<p>The results announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on April 30th are sufficient to prove that the Japanese army has launched a great operation from the mainland to the Admiralty Islands south of the equator, in this 2,000-mile waterway. From this announcement, it is known that the enemy ships off the Ryukyus have suffered as many as 470 casualties since the start of the battle, and most of them are ships used for combat. Therefore, it can be estimated that approximately 80% of the enemy ships used for combat in the Pacific have been damaged. However, the war in the Pacific is different from the war in Europe, and naval power is the most important condition. Therefore, the enemy's fleet has suffered heavy damage. No matter what the war situation in Europe is, it will be difficult to speed up and smoothly promote operations in the Pacific from now on.</p>
<p>Attempting to Recover Ground Losses</p>
<p>Since the enemy has suffered great losses at sea, they now want to recover their ground losses. Therefore, since April 19th, they have started to stir up trouble and directly attacked the strong Japanese positions south of Ryukyu Island. However, their advance has been slow and has been repeatedly blocked by the Japanese army, resulting in great losses of troops. Furthermore, the enemy hopes to eliminate the power of the Japanese mainland air force, so they have mobilized B-29 heavy bombers to bomb from the Mariana Islands, with an almost continuous stream. However, the Japanese air force will not be damaged by the enemy's B-29 bombings, and now it is still dispatching to the Ryukyu area to attack enemy ships on a large scale, and the results of its battles are remarkable.</p>
<p>The Japanese People Are Even More Tempered</p>
<p>At the time of the world war transformation, the nation is even more tempered and determined to pursue and attack the enemy Americans and enemy British. We hope that the nations of our East Asian allies will work closely with Japan, endure all difficulties, and increase combat power in order to liberate the East Asian nations. This is our glory.</p>

The police from the Puhua Road (普陀路) sub-bureau in charge of the area went to the scene to suppress the fire, maintain order, and assist the firefighters in rescuing the people. By 5:00 AM, the fire had been completely extinguished. According to the investigation, a total of more than 260 houses were destroyed, and more than 370 households were affected.

<p>We, not deterred by our feeble strength, with the spirit of "a newborn calf fears no tiger," are trying to run a night school in our spare time, entirely voluntarily. We do not seek to contribute to society, but merely to fulfill our human responsibility of mutual assistance. As for expenses, some are covered by donations from others, and some by dipping into our own pockets, so it is generally not a problem. The most difficult thing we feel is the electricity for the lights. With only six degrees of electricity, the night school uses more than the limit, so we have to think of other ways, like retrofitting storage batteries, but because the light is too weak, even students sitting in the front find it difficult to see the words written on the blackboard. Therefore, we feel much more strained when teaching. We feel very sorry for the students, as their studies will be greatly affected. But we will continue to run it, as long as we have a bit of strength, we will use that strength well. We hope that the authorities can understand our plight and, within the realm of possibility, extend the electricity limit for obligatory night schools. This is a worthwhile issue to consider in the sense of aiding universities. (Liu Zhizhi)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Nanshi People's Hospital Holds Relocation Ceremony, Hopes All Circles Will Donate Money to Help the Poor and Sick <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Nanshi People's Hospital at 775 Minguo Road, this city, was founded in the late spring of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). At that time, public-spirited people, seeing that Nanshi had not recovered from the damage after the incident (likely referring to the war), and that most of the residents in this area were poor, found it even more difficult to bear the cost of illness. Every summer, epidemics breed, making people feel helpless and waiting for death. Therefore, the establishment of the Nanshi Epidemic Hospital was proposed to assist the various hospitals in this area. Initially located on Zhaojia Road, with simple facilities, it provided diagnosis and medicine, saving thousands of civilians from summer to winter. Later, as the number of patients increased and the hospital site was insufficient, and it was felt that there was a need to add a complete hospital in this area, it was decided by the initiators to change it to the People's Hospital. After moving to the new site in January of this year, the hospital rooms were expanded, X-ray machines were purchased, and operating rooms and laboratory rooms were opened. Regarding the important equipment of the hospital, everything that should be available is available, the planning is gradually complete, and the services are becoming more extensive. There are currently more than 100 beds, with 40 to 50 inpatients, and more than 100 outpatients every day. Poor and sick people are given diagnosis and medicine, and the diagnosis work is becoming more and more complicated, and the expenditure is also increasing day by day. However, the hospital's funding is limited, and the number of poor and sick people is increasing day by day, resulting in a feeling of inability despite great effort. Regular expenses originally relied on donations from all parties, but due to insufficient funding, poor patients cannot be accommodated as much as possible, which is regrettable. Recently, it was learned that the hospital will hold a relocation ceremony in the main hall of the hospital at 10:00 AM on May 3, in order to let the outside world understand the actual situation of serving the poor and sick, and to invite all circles to visit, in order to arouse the enthusiasm of public-spirited people to support them together. If you are willing to donate cash to be used as the hospital's medical fund, it will directly help the poor and sick, and indirectly benefit the society.</p>
