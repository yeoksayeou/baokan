<h3>赫爾利突然辭職　馬歇爾任駐華特使　中美合作將愈臻密切</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日合衆電〕白宮宣佈前陸軍參謀總長馬歇爾元帥繼赫爾利將軍爲駐華使節，馬歇爾元帥將以杜魯門總統特使地位，赴華任大使職。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日路透電〕美官方宣佈馬歇爾元帥繼任赫爾利將軍，爲駐華使節，乃臨時性質，渠藉此可執行其特別任務。馬歇爾元帥自一九三九年以還，即任美陸軍參謀總長，前歐洲盟軍總司令。艾森豪威爾元帥於上週繼馬歇爾元帥任陸軍參謀總長。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕據美新聞處華盛頓廿七日電，美總統新聞秘書羅斯今日傍晚語記者謂；馬歇爾元帥在其臨時特派任務期間，仍保有五星元帥官銜。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕新任美駐華大使馬歇爾將軍，今日晋謁杜魯門總統與國務卿貝爾納斯，有所請示</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十八日電〕美國駐華大使赫爾利少將辭職後，杜魯門總統不選擇一文人外交家，而選擇五星肩章之馬歇爾將軍以繼任肩章祇有兩星之赫爾利，足見其政策似已進一步。美軍目下在中國主要任務，或不復以解除日軍武裝爲限。國務院與陸軍部嘗於數星期來迭次聲明，美軍之開赴華北，僅爲便利日軍投降，而非作爲美國外交政策之工具。赫爾利辭職以前，美國對華政策嘗因美軍有被牽入中國內戰之危險，而加以嚴密檢討。故當新大使馬歇爾將軍由華盛頓赴重慶任所時，杜魯門總統於中國時局已可由兩方面獲得新情報。其一爲海軍次長蓋斯已由遠東歸來，旦夕即可抵美京。蓋氏曾在珍珠港告記者，請將向富局提出建議，足以影響美國對華政策。其二爲杜總統私人代表洛克，因經濟使命來華，考察兩月後，亦已由重慶啟程回國。據重慶方面來電，馬歇　將軍對於美軍應吾留居中國一事，可以當機立斷。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十七日電」美國駐華大使赫爾利辭職後，杜魯門總統立即任命馬歇爾將軍爲駐華特派大使，華盛頓官塲方面皆謂，此舉足見美政府對於解決遠東糾紛殊極重視。共和黨參議院外交委員會委員喀柏稱：馬歇爾將軍必能立即解決中國時局，其任命必可由參議院全體一致予以通過。馬歇爾爲全國最優秀最幹練之領袖人才，杜總統選擇之賢明無過於此。馬歇爾將軍此行，可斷言其必獲成功。中國駐美大使魏道明，則謂尚未接到正式公報，故不願有所評論。此次赫爾利之辭職，與馬歇爾之繼任，如機關槍射擊連續而來，使美京人士爲之震駭。據白宮方面宣布，赫氏突然辭職殊出意外，馬歇爾之任命，則將在中國推行當前需要之某種特殊工作。預料馬氏不日即將啓程赴渝履新。副國務卿麥克特穆德告記者稱：赫氏原已於昨日表示辭意，國務卿貝爾納斯勸其變更初衷，回華復任，赫氏本已允諾。貝爾納斯曾於今日傍晚晋見杜總統，同時國務院與陸海軍部聯絡委員會亦於今日開會，決定美國遠東政策。</p>
<h3>赫爾利發表辭職聲明　抨擊美外交政策　支技好戰集團何異摧殘民主　建議公開宣布助中國謀安定</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕美駐華大使赫爾利辭職後，發表正式聲明，指責美國以租借物資及國家之聲譽爲工具，結束遠東戰事，無非以支持帝國主義及共產主義爲目的，是與摧殘民主何異。職業化之美國外交政策，徧袒中國共產黨及帝國主義集團，使中國內部形成分割之局面，美國之職業外交家，竟一再告中國共產黨，謂本人支援國民政府之政策，不能代表美國之政策，我主政當局，對於美國之目標雖有明白之定義，然於處理外交之際，又往往與其背道而馳。吾人宣戰之初，固係以維護大西洋憲章及民主原則爲號召，然而作戰之方式，則正與口稱之民主原則相反，美國外交之懦弱無能，已使國家兩次捲入戰爭，然猶不知悛改。今第三次大戰又在醞釀之中，本人絕端擁護民主自由之原則，第一次大戰吾人即曾宣布必使民主主義得以安然存在於世界，第一次世界大戰時，此等口號又見之於大西洋憲章及德黑蘭宣言，兩次戰爭結果，雖均獲得勝利，然而奮戰以赴之原則則始終未見確立。美國外交界人士，由於內部分裂故，遂為他國所乘，以甘言密語，易取我國之物質援助，今在醞釀中之戰爭，則甚至已不以保護民主爲原則目的。美國非但不能爲聯合國之憲章作後盾，且更積極支援帝國主義者之集團，而我國務院之一大部份人員，更主張普遍支援共產主義，尤其是中國之共產黨。赫爾利繼乃陳述美國在亞洲之活動，應有擴大宣傳之必要，尤以在中國及其他木人四年來所曾服務之國家，更應有多方面之眞實宜傳，俾使國外對我不致有所誤解，而最爲重要者，即爲使美國之外交及經濟政策步驟一致，吾人應以國家之力量，支持聯合國決議，切不可支持衝突之主義及好戰之集團。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕赫爾利辭去駐華大使後，即向國務院建議，主張公開宣布對華政策，並「切實聲明美國將使中國安定，直至聯合國機構能負起責任而後已」。同時電賀馬紹爾上將出任駐華特使，認爲此項任命「對於局勢大有裨益」。</p>
<p>爲赫爾利氏</p>
<h3>駐華特使馬歇爾將軍</h3>
<p>〔本報資料室稿〕聞名全球的馬歇爾將軍，現已被任爲美國駐華特使。以五星肩章的元帥階級軍人，出使外國，這實是美國外交上空前的創舉。這點特別値得我們重視。</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍上星期方辭參謀總長，他曾被譽爲「引導美國走向勝利之人物」。全名爲喬治·凱特勞特。馬歇爾。一八八〇年十二月卅一日生於賓夕爾凡尼亞州的聯合市，今年已有六十五歲的高齡。</p>
<p>這次他膺命使華，並不是第一次，一九二四年至一九二七年中國國民革命時期，他也奉過陸軍部之命來中國，在天津擔任過第十五步兵聯隊聯隊長之職，所以，對中國革命的經過與成功，他早有極深刻的認識。</p>
<p>他是美國創設五星肩章後，於去年十二月十六日當他正在對德發動最後一擊時接受此一特殊榮譽之第一人。美國國會之創設此一軍級，尙爲美國歷史上之前所未有的事，而所以將此軍級畀予馬歇爾將軍者，蓋意在對此一偉大軍人之　與國家的功績，酬以適當的殊榮。</p>
<p>一九四一年十二月七日美國被捲入戰爭後，馬歇爾將軍乃組建出國遠征軍，彼等足跡遍及東西二大半球及六大洲各地。此外，又創設空遝師團，跳傘部隊及撬車部隊，這種新單位，都是以前軍事人昌所未曾夢想到過的。在盟軍聯合參謀總部中，他支持世界各處其他聯合國家的軍隊作戰，樹立了輝煌貢獻，促成軸心國家之提早崩潰，他的燦爛成就，使今日美國陸軍，成爲澈底現代化的軍力。馬歇爾姓名與其傑出的指導工作，將與歷史永垂不朽。</p>
<p>他在作戰期內，經常與美國海軍總司令金氏王將保持密切合作，在對日作戰中，克服了太平洋上因面積廣泛，所引起的種種困難。他運用出人頭地的機智，由美國通過綿長的交通綫，將援軍武器及供應物品，都得按照預定計劃，一一達到目的地，由中太平洋進而收復菲律賓羣島，最後終於迫使日本屈膝，不得不向盟軍提出無條件投降，完成其歷史的任務，使今後世界獲得建立永久和平的基礎。</p>
<p>他是部下最所愛戴的領袖。國會聯絡官庇爾森斯准將曾謂馬歇爾將軍「實爲余生平所熟知的任何一人中，担任民主政治軍職之最適宜的人物。」無論參議院或衆議院，無論民主黨或共和黨，對於馬歇爾將軍都寄以完全的信任，而無須有人爲他作證，因爲他處事極端審愼，旣無個人野心，又能接受他人意見，所以大家相信他實是保證美國安全的象徵人物。</p>
<p>他雖是美國最知名的軍人，但並非西點軍校出身，因爲他十七歲投考該校時，不能拉到一個衆議員爲他作祖保人，以致被擯門外，結果他到佛吉尼亞軍校去實現了他的投軍志願。他在聯合市上也未獲得過學位，在軍校一年級時，名次僅列入第三十五名，畢業時也僅第十五名，他一九〇六年在福特里夫華斯參謀學校畢業後，開始加人軍隊服務。其後調職菲島，於舉行演習防守馬尼刺時，致書與貝爾少將（一九〇六年至一九一〇年之參謀總長），陳述其防守計劃，而爲貝爾所賞識，認爲係不可多得之參謀人才。第一次大戰將近結束時，他以二星期之時間，在法國調運六十萬人未有損失，而爲潘興將軍所稱道。議和後在潘興將軍下担任隨員五年。一九三七年升任爲准將，被委爲第五步兵旅旅長，一九三八年曾調參謀本部任戰事設計處處長職，一九三九年春，羅斯福總統擢拔他爲代理參謀總長，一九三九年九月一日希特勒進攻波蘭，被任爲參謀總長獲四星上將銜位。一九四四年十一月二十六日羅斯福總統以橡皮勳章相授，十二月五日由國會通過升爲五星上將。二次大戰結束後，以年老請求退休，上星期辭職獲准。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾特使來華　必獲我朝野歡迎</h3>
<p>魏道明大使晋謁杜魯門　〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕外記者招待會於廿八日下午三時舉行，由吳部長國楨，劉次長鍇主持，茲誌主要問答如下：</p>
<p>問：赫爾利大使辭職，馬歇爾元帥出任特使，中國方面反響如何，馬歇爾元帥來華日期，官方有所聞吾。答：赫爾利大使，爲中國之眞實偉大友人，赫氏辭職，自令人惋惜。馬歇爾元師，爲美國當代名將，此番以特使身份來華，自必獲我朝野歡迎。蔣主席曾數度邀請馬歇爾元帥訪華，深信蔣主席與馬氏會晤，必將極爲愉快。至馬歇爾元帥來華確期，尙無所聞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕中國駐美大使魏道明聞赫爾利少將辦去駐華大使職，表示惋惜。魏氏並稱：「赫爾利促進中美兩國更密切之關係，厥功甚偉，新任大使馬歇爾將軍，定能將兩國在和平時之密切關係，予以加强」。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕據美新聞處華盛頓廿七日電，中國駐美大使魏道明氏本日謁杜魯門總統，商討遠東一般問題。事後對記者謂；中國並不擬要求美國對於中國國內問題之解決加以援手。渠於白宮中對記者稱：中國目下情况「呌囂多於槍聲」，並信能以「和平方式」消除一般異見。</p>
<h3>熊式輝蔣經國等　待機返長春</h3>
<p>國軍距瀋陽巳不足三百里</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿八日電〕東北行營主任熊式輝，東北外交特派員蔣經國，現均候機飛平，轉赴長春，尙有其他接收人員，亦凖備啓程，至返回北平接收人員，已有一部分回抵長春。外傳蘇聯要求與我國共同開發東北礦產及其他經濟事業，記者本日向張嘉璈氏探詢究竟，張氏答稱：蘇聯並無此種要求，外傳不確。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕東北保安長官司令部，已隨國軍之進展，遷往興城。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿八日電〕據今日外交界權威方面消息：重慶莫斯科刻已成立協定，允許國軍利用瀋陽及長春機塲，趕速由空路開往東北。傳國軍已過密雲，向古北口推進。依據此項協定，中國官員可以立即遄返長春，接收其以前因受共軍威脅而退出之區域。軍方消息：謂駐北平之國軍將爲第一批由空路開赴東北之國軍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿八日電〕國軍開入東九省，聞距潘陽已不足三百華里。據此間所接報告，共軍司令朱德已抵瀋陽，佈置防務，準備與國軍苦戰。記者向東北保安司令部駐平辦事處詢問，未能證實此說。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿八日電〕此間發表，國軍廿六日抵達錦州，該縣飛機塲尚有日軍飛機約百餘架。又北寗路已可通至錦縣。</p>
<h3>中美訂合同　建大水閘　發長江水利</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十八日電〕內長伊克斯宣布，美當局已與中國全國資源委負會簽訂合同，由美國工程師擬具計劃，在長江三峽建築空前偉大之水泥鋼骨大水閘，以控制水勢，使長江流域數千萬居民得免數百年來不絕發生之氷災飢饉。此項水閘所蓄之水，且可利用其水力供給發電，中國政府將償付五十萬美元，作爲技術援助經費，同時該計劃預定建築其他水閘多座，開掘運河數千里，以供灌溉及其他各種設備。所有一切規劃，均由美國水閘設計專家薩伐其監督，渠於一九四四年在華研究長江水利計劃，歷時數月，該項計劃之發展，須時二十五年，並包括建築世界最大水力發電廠計劃在內，水閘足以控制水勢，改善航運，將來海洋輪船或可直駛重慶。</p>
<h3>政治協商會議代表　張治中留迪化　改吳鐵城充任</h3>

<h3>魏德邁巴貝飛渝　謁將委員長商華北美軍事　洛克赴津短期內將再來滬</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本埠二十八日訊〕美國第七艦隊司令巴貝海軍中將，與駐華美軍司令魏德邁中將，今曼聯袂赴渝，與蔣委員長有所會商。貝氏自受任第七艦隊司令以來，留滬已數日。上週末渠與杜魯門總統負責賠償事務之私人代表鮑萊一行在渝。此間並宣佈巴貝海軍中將之旗艦「埃斯丹斯」號現在靑島，不久將馳赴秦皇島，而貝氏亦即將前往，以便親自指揮該艦在華北方面之活動。今日此兩美國將領重慶之行，似出意料，其任務雖不得而知，然顯與華北之美軍有關。華北美國海軍陸戰隊洛克少將，亦曾在此間與巴氏會商。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二十八日電〕魏德邁二級上將二十八日下午四時半，偕美海軍第七艦隊司令巴貝中將，自滬飛抵渝。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美駐華北海軍陸戰隊司令洛基將軍，已於昨（廿八）日離滬返天津。洛氏抵滬後，曾先後與駐中國戰區司令魏德邁將軍，駐中國空軍總司令斯特拉特梅耶將軍，及駐中國海軍司令巴貝將軍會談。據洛氏對記者稱：彼與巴貝將軍商談達數小時，內容未便發表。浴氏又稱：天津情形不甚寗靜，入夜後街道即無行人。洛氏此次偕參謀長伍頓將軍回津後，可能在最近期間再來滬一行。</p>
<h3>社論　美更迭駐華使節</h3>
<p>昨日美京電訊，美國駐華大使赫爾利將軍辭職，馬歇爾元帥奉命以杜魯門總統特使地位、來華繼任大使職務。又訊，馬歇爾元帥已同意爲美總統執行一項特別任務。而同時赫爾利大使辭職後復發表正式聲明，謂美國當局之外交政策，受若干職業外交家之阻撓，此殆表示其所以辭職之故。各方電訊，迄目前爲止，尙感語焉不詳，無從據以評斷。惟此次美國在巡迭駐華大使之前，對華政策必經深切之辯論，而美總統特派方自參謀總長卸任之馬歇爾元帥以繼赫爾利將軍之後，則美國向所秉持之對華政策，我們深信不但必仍貫澈始終，且將更作强有力的執行。</p>
<p>我們首先對赫爾利大使之辭職，不復返華，深致惋惜。赫氏率故總統羅斯福之命，前來我國，初則別有重任，繼即改任大使。對於援助中國獲得勝利，及促成國共協議，希望中國走上民主和平建設之大道，熱誠毅力，頗爲中外人士所共見。目前我國雖已抗戰勝利，政治協商會議召開有期，而究竟國府受降工作尚未全部順利完成，經濟建設亦正待開始努力，赫氏却因其懷抱之未能暢行，忽然辭職而不復返，在我們自有漸入佳境而良友遠行之感。所幸繼之而來者，竟爲馬歇爾元帥。馬氏爲人，不但軍事天才，卓越恒流，日賦性坦白眞誠，以體諒人帮助人爲至樂，而其建設美國大陸軍以維護世界民主政治的功績，尤爲舉世人士所稱道。此時奉命來華，更負有特別任務。吾人對杜魯門總統之知人善任，固非常欽佩，而馬歇爾元帥樂於此時負此新命，尤値得吾人的景仰與歡迎。</p>
<p>美國外交政策，本極顯明，而對華政策尤見一貫。上月二十七日杜魯門總統發表海軍紀念節演說，更有詳明之闡述。其保持世界和平，反對任何侵略的宏願，不惜以擁有强大武力求其貫澈。而在遠東，自必樂見有一强大興盛的民主的中國，與其携手共進，分担維護和平的責任。此固無待吾人再行縷陳。惟是赫爾利大使旣鑒於美外交當局之懦弱，認爲美國對亞洲政策之失敗，因而提出辭表，則當此使節更迭之際，一述吾人對中美關係之意見，向美國盟友坦白說幾句話，世寗是多少有益之事。</p>
<p>當列强企圖瓜分中國之際，海約翰提出了門戶間放政策，保全了中國領土主權的完整，此爲美國對華政策奠立初基其。後當第一次世界大戰時，日本企岡在中國取得獨特地位，故大戰終了後，美國召開華盛頓會議，重申保證中國領土主權完整的政策。日本不顧條約尊嚴，企圖憑藉武力，造成欺人的「大東亞共榮圈」，與美國國策發生正面衝突，終至激成世界第二次大戰。所以支持一個領土主權完整的中國，應爲美國亞洲政策之骨幹。而欲與中國人民爲友，自必援助人民所共戴的國民政府。故支持國民政府應爲次國對華政策之核心。前國務卿赫爾最近曾稱：『（一）吾人之莊重義務即爲與中國合作，並保全其領土完整。（二）吾人向爲中國友人，而中國擁有四億人口。（三）吾人擁護國際合作及國際糾紛應求和平解決之政策。（四）吾人遠於一九三六年即聲明一國之侵略行爲，實與各國休戚相關。吾人本可退休家園，然余不願於今日面對諸君縷述吾人竟然退休後所將發生之事。』這闡明美國的立塲，可謂坦直之至。</p>
<p>在中國三民主義的理想，多少與美國的民有，民治，民享的民主傳統相合。中國國民所努力的建國工作，就在建立起一個領土主權完整，富强康樂，包容着西歐民主精神的新中國。在這艱巨工作上，中國國民希望得到美國的充分支持。這正如美國當建國之初，也曾得到西歐革命後的法蘭西的支持一樣。中國在建國工作上所遭遇到困難，也正如美國在建國之初所遭遇到的困難一樣，故也惟美國最能了解。在現階段的中國，我們政治上的民主雖還未曾達到我們所理想的境域，但這正是我們目今一切努力的鵠的。在社會方面，中國人民的民主習尙，本質上實與美國無殊。所以中國人民向視美國爲友。這也許不是過分的說法，就是國民間眞情的融洽怕沒有再甚於中美兩國人民之間的了。</p>
<p>統的友好，又加上了這次比肩作戰共同打倒敵人的深厚盟誼，中美兩國間的關係可謂極爲親善。現在太平洋上武裝戰鬥雖然終止，但戰事還不曾完全結束。美國現在的政策，雖或不免有如赫爾利大使所說的那樣遇到若干阻礙，但到現在爲止，美國政府所採取的對華政策，大體上頗爲中國人民所贊許。這政策是維護並支持蔣委，長所領導的國民政府，並協助國軍受降接收等事。我們深知中國人應努力自助，但同時也深知美軍執行這種任務多少乃基於他自身的立塲，在中國的敵人原就是美國的敵人，美國有協助中國的盟義。但不幸的是稱兵作亂之徒，阻碍國軍接收受降的工作。他們希望爲所欲爲，阻擾國民政府完成接收受降以及恢復地方秩序的工作，竟製造出美軍參加中國內戰的謠言，希圖淆惑聽聞，達到撤回美軍的目的。我們今天要指出這一種別有用心的主張決不能代表中國多數人民的意見。美國盟友，必能洞若觀火。美國現在駐華的軍隊是否應該立即退休家園？只要看日軍繳械是否己完全遣回本國。若不考察事實，而就想退回到孤立的老路上，那是一件不明智的事。</p>
<p>總之，基於中美兩國傳統的友誼，基於美國傳統的國策，中國人民希望馬歇爾元帥使華以後，美國更能加強對國民政府的支持。這不僅是中國惟一的合法政府，且爲大多數中國人民所擁護。中國人民所希望的是在國民政府下得以實現他們建國的理想。這一艱巨工作，我們需要我們的盟邦，特別是建國理想多少相同的美國的協力。我們深稽馬歇爾元帥爲着美國一貫的國策，能够滿足我們的願　；在中國歷史上，在人類的歷史上，準備寫下極珍貴的一頁。</p>

<h3>臺灣文化協進會的創立</h3>
<p>— 游彌堅</p>
<p>臺灣被日本統治了五十一年，也就是臺灣同胞做了五十一年日本的奴隸，一切的經濟—財富資源，都被剝削無餘，臺灣人只能以奴隸的身分生存。一切的文化—思想言論，都被壓制到像悶豆芽似地，無天日可見，無生長的餘地。在帝國主義的高壓下，一天一天地培植了法西斯的細菌，因此臺灣人在這五十一年的中間被法西斯的毒素，麻醉得相當利害，帝國主義的根，漫延在臺灣的社會也相當的深。</p>
<p>現在臺灣雖然光復，大家重新回到祖國的懷抱來，同時大家希望趕快建立三民主義的新臺灣，做三民主義下的好百姓。但是毒素不是一旦可以掃除乾凈，毒根不是一天可以掘得淸楚。爲了趕快實現三民主義的理想，我們應該如何來淸除這些毒素，掘掉這些毒根？如何來改變我們這被奴化的觀念？如何來協助政府建設新臺灣？這是我們應富考慮，應當努力的地方。臺灣文化協進會創設的動機，也就是從這裏產生出來的。臺灣文化協進會的目的，是要宣塲三民主義的精神，灌輸民主政治的思想，改變被奴化的臺灣文化，協助政府推行政令，傳習國文國語，並對社會做種種的服務工作。不過這種重要的工作，不是少數人可以做得了的。非有羣策羣力，大家聯合起來做不可。所以我們才來發起這臺灣文化協進會，希望大家加入這個團體，精誠團結，共同一致，來推行我們新臺灣人民對新臺灣應做的事情。（未完）</p>

<h3>程中行派員調查　各倉庫弊端百出　僻遠處甚至漏列倉庫名目　即勉強啓封又多不肯移交</h3>
<p>中央社記者，昨赴江蘇監察使署，專訪程監察使中行，詢問監察使署最近工作狀况，承程監察使綜合答覆如下。</p>
<p>點查倉庫　竟有未附清册</p>
<p>（一）關於澈查各方面接收事宜，連日正派員分赴各有關機關及當地鄰近訪察，現階段的接收爲最初各軍政機關接收之倉庫，奉命移交海關點收，海關此次點收之倉庫與碼頭，共計有五百個單位。其中原山我海軍接收而交出者，有一百個單位，半月來經海關當局動員全體關員及關　參加工作，據調卉所得，點收時之困難，一爲交出倉庫之機關，往往不附敵人原交之淸册。亦有僻遠地方之倉庫，幷倉庫名目亦種列，如最近被焚之兩倉庫，即屬於此類。尙有若干倉庫，原接收人員藉口某種理由，不肯移交，亦有若干倉庫，倉庫內之某部份藉口某彼理由，不允移交點收，經勉强啓封後，又有各種藉口，延不移交。亦有在接收某一倉庫時，鄰近倉庫忽來大批卡車，滿載貨物而去。此種情形直接藐視政府法令，間接妨害物價及民生，本署已陸續向中央最高當局呈報</p>
<p>蘇省軍警　強迫攤派捐款</p>
<p>（二）蘇省收復各地區，據本署調查所得，地方軍警對商民農民强迫攤派捐款者，重見疊出，即以上海一市而論，本署迭接商民控吿，對於警察分局以低價强迫購米反强買店舖貨物，動輒拘捕商民之情事，深感痛苦，均經派員密查，本署對市內不法警員，將用迅速有效辦法，依法請當局嚴懲，以洩民憤，而舒商困。（三）本署近來接有若干具名之控吿案件，呈文內並有擔保商舖，所控事實，均甚詳細，但當本署派員澈查，傳訊具呈人及保證人，往往　匿久不到案。此種情形，固由商民怵於官廳之積威，或另有顧忌，但深盼人民此時爲自己權利，應有負責態度，出與惡勢力奮鬥。</p>
<h3>三批平價布疋　明日起發售</h3>
<p>上海區敵僞產業處理局，第三批平價布疋，已決定於（三十日）起開始應市。除原有永安，先施，新新，大新及國貨五大公司外，為普遍供應起見，於滬西方而，增加大滬及上海兩家，舊法租界方面，增加友信及信大祥兩家，南市方面，增加協大祥一家，共爲十處，分佈全市區。至布疋種類及們格，計喜鶴士林布，每碼定價九百元，　　白斜紋布，每碼四百五十元，白絨布每碼六百元，白府綢每碼六百元，黑嗶嘰每碼八百元，白細布每碼四百五十元，其中一部份價格，較上批又見减低。</p>
<h3>外人租用土地　應向地局登記</h3>
<p>市地政局依據中央法令，制定永租契或通契土地登記辦法，呈准市政府核准公佈，依該項辦法規定，外國人租用土地，執有永租契或道契者，應逕向市地政局聲請爲永租權登記，如該項永租契或道契，屬於國人所有，應聲請　所有權登記，至過去掛號洋商，依法無登記過戶及發給權利證件之權，近各報刋登英商愛爾德洋行等十四外商，重行辦理產權手讀通吿，殊有不合，主管當局正謀適當處置，並望市民愛護國家主權，巡向市地政局辦理登記。</p>
<h3>本市新路名　下月一日實行</h3>
<p>上海市政府因本市若干道路舊名與現名頗多不妥，有改定之必要，除愛多亞路。福煦路。大西路。已於十月三十日命名爲中正路外，現決定（一）黃浦灘（現名黃浦灘路）改名中山路。（二）霞飛路（現名「泰山路」））改名林森路。（三）辣斐德路（現各「大興路「）改名復興路。（四）康悌路（現名「長興路」）福履理路（現名「南海路」），　華立路（現名「西長興路」），合併改爲建國路。（五）靜安寺路「改名南京西路。（六）藍維　路（現名「安微路」），敏體尼蔭路（現名「寧夏路」），改名西藏南路。（七）愛文義路（現名「大同路））改名北京西路。以上各路之名稱，均將於十二月一日起改定。</p>
<h3>船舶調配委會　處理全國航運</h3>
<p>記者昨午往訪甫自渝返滬之國營招商局總經理徐學禹氏，叩詢關於　展航運之具體方案，渠答稱：全國船舶調配委員會定於下月一日在渝成立，該委員會已奉宋院長諭令，所有船舶俱由該會調配。該會並劃分兩管理區域，漢口以上之船舶，歸渝地之船舶調配委員會負責，由盧·祁·兩副主任委員主持其事。漢口以下及沿海之船舶航運，由上海方面船舶調配委員會負責管理，由劉生任委員鴻生及本人辦理。</p>
<h3>昨日文化界盛會　張道藩報告陪都八年文化概況　許教炎謂立法院正修訂出版法</h3>
<p>中央文化運動委負會主任委員張道藩，中實部副部長許孝炎，於昨日下午二時半，在康樂酒家聯合舉行招待本市文化界茶會，到文化新聞電影戲劇界人士五百餘人。</p>
<p>一般文化都有進步</p>
<p>三時正張道藩致辭報吿八年來陪都敎育，新聞·出版·文藝·音樂·美術·戲劇·電影·雜劇之發展槪况，略謂（一）敎育方面在量和質方面，大體都有進步。（二）新聞方面對十輿論的領導民氣的發場，都有很大貢獻。（三）出版方面。雖因紙張印刷的條件不够，量和質卻都進步。（四）文藝藝方面，在建國時期，有新的結合與新的努力。此外音樂美術戲劇電影雜技都提高了民間藝術的地位</p>
<p>許氏報告新聞自由</p>
<p>繼由許副部長致辭，略謂本人對張道藩先生的報告有一點補充，也可說是文化界人士所喜歡聽的一個消息。就是中央正在預備修正出版法。益以現所施用之出版法細則，是抗戰前擬定的，其後又爲適應戰時需要，增有補充法規，現戰事已結束，戰時補充法規已不再需要存在，並根據出版自由新聞自由之原則，將現行出版法所有條規，重行加以裁廢或修正。過去限制範圍較廣，今後大槪僅限制妨害善良風俗，及妨害治安之文字刋載。至於出版登記，在戰時因爲保持軍事外交秘密及印刷材料紙張關係，而加以限制，今後則將僅爲是一種手續而已。此修正之新出版法，已由國防於高委員會通過，現送立法院審核中。一俟公佈，中國文化界之前途當更可光明而發揚廣大。</p>
<p>又悉張道藩氏，下月即將赴日考察日本文化。</p>

<h3>本星期六可產生「黃包車皇後」　魏德邁將軍擬親臨參加</h3>
<p>美國人活潑好動的心，向來是任何其他國家的人所不及的。當他們初次來到上海後，看見馬路上無數的人力車和三輪車，擠來擠去時，無疑的，都感到莫大的興趣來了。離開了家鄕很久後的美國孩子們，大槪早就希望來上海後可以回味一下美國熱閙的玩意兒。可是事實上，他們失望了。今日的上海並不是他們想像中的上海。回力球塲早已歇業，跑馬廳和跑狗塲中的馬與狗，不是飢餓而死，或雙了牛肉羊肉被吃掉，也早已被出賣了。然而他們須要刺激和熱鬧的心，却不能因之而减少；果然，他們想出了一樣新的玩意兒。他們要舉辦一個「人力車競賽會」，由星條報中國特刋所發起。記者特地去訪該報，獲得詳細情形。</p>
<p>本星期六（十二月一日）下午，美陸軍和海軍將在亞爾培路跑狗巧，舉行足球比賽，在足球賽以前，即將選出上海「黃包車皇后」一位。參加競賽的，共有二十輛人力車。每輛車上坐一位小姐，由人力車夫拉着賽跑。是日下午一時起始，在外灘出發，經南京路·靜安寺路·西摩路·向西轉灣至亞爾培路跑狗塲爲止。首先到達終點的車即得頭獎。</p>
<p>參加競賽的小姐們中，有四位中國人，一位美國人，一位加拿大人，其餘均爲俄國人。各位小姐都代表她所屬機關，或代表某重要長官如魏德邁·史特梅將軍等。二十輛人力車中有四輛乃在路上雇來的，其他都是私人包車。現在都由美軍方面特別派人加緊在跑馬廳訓練，已足足費去十天的功夫。各車都將裝飾得鮮艷奪目。又第十航空隊還特地製就鋁質輕快車一輛，參加比賽。</p>
<p>競賽路科計三英里，大約需時二十分鐘左右。屆時魏德邁·史特梅專將軍，都要親臨主持典禮</p>
<p>據吿，星條報將以七百萬元僞幣，作爲獎品，頭獎爲二百萬元僞幣，其餘再分數級分配。此外尙有其她物品贈送各競賽者。</p>
<p>至於競賽時之道路交通秩序，均由美軍部特派憲兵維持。</p>
<p>這種空前特殊的新鮮賽跑，必然的又將使上海人多一件有趣的議話資料了。</p>
<h3>本市簡訊</h3>
<p>本市南京路商聯會近擬具抑平物價意見書一種，於昨日推派代表晉謁杜月笙氏，請予採擇。</p>

<p>財政局解釋徵收屠宰稅，其稅額之多寡，純係肉價漲落之結果，如肉價低落，則稅額自亦隨之趨落。</p>
<p>市府工務局於前日起，飭大批工匠，首先修理外白渡橋。行人車輛均照常通行。</p>
<p>麥根路車站，昨日下午三時，有貨車一列，突然出軌，直至下午六時，始吿修復。</p>
<h3>氣象預測</h3>

<p>昨日溫度最低五七·四，最高六一·〇。</p>
<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>棉紗供不敷求　金市風平浪靜</h3>
<p>棉紗</p>
<p>紗市繼續上升，良以湘漢等帮　胃頗佳，二〇支紗現貨在供不數求情况下又漲二萬，三二支細紗及四二支雙綫，尤爲客帮所搜購，堯狂升十萬之　，十六支以下仍無生色，價與上日相彷，昨日江順輪出口，有棉紗七百件，疋頭五百件，運往漢口。</p>
<p>烚亦</p>
<p>昨（二十八日）市况盤旋，連朝因種種揣測，以致兎起鶴落，結果兩敗俱傷，浮多斬殺於前，散空扒補於後，迄昨日始雨過天青，風平浪靜，在八十萬大關屢起掙扎，結果跌二萬餘，惟午收後繼續下游，曾退至七七萬零，津市金價以銀根突緊，跌至六萬以內，渝地亦有銀根大緊之訊，此後各地到貨勢將更湧，趨勢難期有所作爲，銀樓飾金亦自八萬六掛小至八萬四，銀元因銀樓紋銀仍掛六百五，昨仍爲四百四至四四五元間，暗拆步高，昨約一角半至一角八分間</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>昨稍見軟，金價不振，津市慘跌，因而自一三六〇元步降至一三三〇元左右，結果較前日小二十元，港幣則因港澳報價較昂，大勢尙平，（彼地老貨的四百元新貨値四分之一美鈔五元零）結果老貨跌五元，新貨跌二元，漢金鎊三千有零，羅比三百左右。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨內行繼續做高，丙種幾迫近五百元大關，然後紛紛出籠，一轉瞬間跌風驟起，破入四百元內，惟趁低不少業外人埀靑，最後仍站住四百三左右，結果各債較前收甲乙種以投機氣氛較淡，價跌二十元，其餘微升不多，變幻之來，恐在不遠，蓋因業中人獲利了結，轉移資金於小型華股，而種種揣測，亦離事實過遠。</p>
<p>股票</p>
<p>初時極爲平靜，迨後債市大戶獲利了結後，資金轉移於各小型股，臨收時竟在　碼枯竭之現象下，突飛猛晋，惟投機氣氛太濃，且當局不斷警吿，愼防意外打擊，外股市况平靜，與前日無甚出入。</p>
<p>米糧</p>
<p>昨日米市，以內地價格仍堅，形成產銷倒懸，搬運不通，貨主甚堅，價略見四升二三百元，油價回小四五百元，黃豆亦小二三百元，麵粉零銷尙可，市形挺立，豆餅棉餅麩皮均平穩。</p>
<p>煤市續呈疲勢，市塲間僅聞賣買雙方問價之聲，而少實際成交，雖殺價之風甚厲，賣戶亦　貶價脫售，紫炭到貨絡繹，同業因市况連日平疲，意呈觀望，價趨下瀉。</p>
<p>呢絨</p>
<p>昨呢絨　交有限，尤以全毛高等貨成交更寡，存底奇缺，喊價太高，故市塲買賣，以本廠貨人造棉絲質與粗毛全紗之次貨爲多，同時因受時事影響，一般囤戶相　停止踢皮球，亦爲减少　進　出之一因也。</p>
<h3>黃台橘子來滬</h3>
<p>近數年來，因受戰事影響，廈門汕頭廣東等處水菓，如橘子香蕉以及甘庶等，本市已絕蹟，惟浙東黃台橘子，尙能來滬，前日茂利輪由溫州到滬，裝來黃台橘子二千七百九十七箱，爲市上獨佔之水菓，至厦門汕頭廣東各地業已收復，本冬上述各地水菓當可運來。</p>
<h3>糯米枝　獻新在即</h3>
<p>糯米枝爲荔枝中之最上品，以交通久阻來源吿乏，市上冷氣貨亦繼檔多時，茲聞本屆新貨巳由香港起運，不日即可抵申，共中元枝扁枝較多，近日物似正在下趨之際，復有新負登塲，於抑平物價上，必有相當助力，查近市巳見面鬆，他如桂圓前後降去二成之　，而泉州新大泡圓昨有續到，開價均有看鬆可能。</p>
<p>昨續刋「帳面資本金額之整理」因稿擠暫停</p>
<h3>起草委員孫九錄談　新公司法內容要點</h3>
<p>公司組織手續簡易化　外商公司採屬地主義</p>
<p>本報特訊，新公司法將於明年一月一日頒行，今尙未公佈，本市工商界傳說不一，本報記者昨特趨訪負責起草該法之立法委員孫九錄氏，叩詢新法案要綱，據孫氏云，新公可法係根椐最高國防委員會第一期經濟實施方案爲出發點，在法理上趨向經濟自由主義，鼓勵民衆用自己的財力人力創立中國急需的工業，因此新公司法有</p>
<p>兩個特點</p>
<p>（一）在法律上，人民與政府有同等的地位，（二）公司組織的手續及程序，較前簡易化，在渦去因適合戰事情形，我國有特種有限公司的組織，使中央政府得與人民或省市機構或外商合辦工商事業，新公司法已無特種公司的規定，以後政府與人民將打成一片，共同推進全國工業。</p>
<p>組織簡易</p>
<p>孫氏又云，新公司法中極顯著的改進，是規定股份有限公司的組織及管理，得採用無限公司的辦法，換言之，有限公司雖在資本上是負有限責任，在組織管理上可就環境的需要，而自由採取有限或無限公司的方式，此乃公司組織簡易化的第一點，其次舊公司法因欲避免大股東操縱，故有限制股權的措施，新法則無此限制，以一股一權爲原則，因此大股東的權益可以得到更充分的保障，關於限制股權，新公司法雖無明文規定，然各公司得以其本身章程訂明限制方式，新公司法的原則，是使民營機構在組織上得到便利，而以嚴肅的罰則去繩之於正軌。</p>
<p>外商公司</p>
<p>記者提出外商公司的組織程序，請孫民解答，孫氏謂新公司法關於外商投資的觀念，是使中外資金能得同等地位，同等保障，並希望中外資金能站在同一立塲上，促進中國工業，新公司法對於所謂「外國公司」，是採取「屬地主義」，即一個公司需有兩個條件，方能取得「外國公司」的地位，（一）在外國須有總公司，（二）在外國須有實際經常營業，其他外商公司皆須依照新公司法組織之，中外合辦的公司資金的比例，並無限制，唯董事長一職，須由有中國國籍者担任，孫氏補充說，我們對於外商投資是採取國際互惠的原則。</p>
<p>新公司法在今年四月間，由孫氏及立法委員盛振爲張肇元起草，於本年十月經立法院三讀通過，規定明年一月一日實施，孫氏因滬地爲全國工商樞紐，特來此考察各公司現實情形，以作參考云。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>地大與物博</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>凡是進　學校的人，大多會有一種印象，以爲中國是『地大物博』的。</p>
<p>中國的『地大』，這是毫欵問的了。此次抗戰八年，中國之所以終獲最後的勝利，『地大』實在是重要的原因之一。如果中國是像丹麥挪威那樣的小國，那中國不知要亡國幾次。現在中國抗戰八年，仍能有一個完整的政府，佔有一部份自由的土地，未始非『地大』之賜。</p>
<p>至於『物博』這兩個字，往往給我國的國民以一種錯誤的幻像，以爲中國資源旣多，物資又富。其實你祇要到內地去走一轉，看到了中國的農村的情形，實在是又窮又苦，物資的種類旣不多，數量又不大。中國事實上是貧乏得很的，那裏說得上『物博』？</p>
<p>中國有許多物資都埋藏在地下，有許多土地都荒廢着。沒有能力加以利用，差不多等於廢物。要中國能富能强，有賴於工業化與機械化，更有賴於埋頭苦幹！</p>
<p>通訊</p>
<h3>解放後的法國</h3>
<p>— 弦</p>
<p>本文作者衛登巴克爾是美國時代與生活二雜誌駐歐主筆。由以下的通訊中，我們可以看到到法國解放後，國內的艱苦狀况，以及全面和平時，巴黎慶祝情形。</p>
<p>——譯者註</p>
<p>我們的車經過衆議院，見那大厦正在燃燒着，一家大旅館墙上彈痕累累，一根大柱子也被炸倒了。街上槍聲，偶一可聞。等我們到旅舍時，月亮已出來。</p>
<p>那天是一九四四年八月二十五日星期五的晚上，是德軍被法人趕出巴黎，美軍進來的那一天。第二天戴高樂領了衣衫襤褸的勝利軍，在市街上首次列隊遊行。於是巴黎又從迷惑中醒過來準備度五年中第一次自由的（但也是最艱苦的）冬天。</p>
<p>在佔領期中，雖然受盡了羞辱痛苦，但生活倒是够興奮的。一方面親德派發了財，享盡黑市生活。一方面地下反抗人員却也嚐到冒險的樂趣。規在解放實現，第一種人希望美國人會替他們緩頰，而第二種人以爲新法國抗戰勝利後，可以復興。但結果從法國解放一直到歐戰結束，九個月中，這兩種希望，一個也未曾實現。</p>
<p>法國解放後，第一個冬天中的生活是苦不堪言。夏秋之交情形尙好。因爲天氣還暖，食料雖少，還不致缺乏到像以後那種地步。電流停止供給後，大厦中必須步行上下，晚上無燈可點。公共汽車，出差汽車都暫停，只有脚踏車或擠得不堪的電車再不然就是步行。除了出得起黑市價的人，其餘市民排了半天隊伍，買着的東西還是不够。工人把少量的烟酒視爲珍品。有錢吸黑市香烟的人也把烟蒂小心的藏起來。</p>
<p>冬日降臨得特別早，痛苦也隨之增加。食料更見缺乏，全市存煤幾等於無。大家把什麽都穿在身上，還是縮在屋子冷得發抖。女人沒襪子穿，出去工作，腿上生滿凍搶。樂師們都戴了剪去指端的手套彈奏。歌舞女要吃　了酒才可以把衣服脫下。有許多考究的紳士一連五個月沒有洗澡。十月裏起，全巴黎的人都患了傷風，大家咳到五月中才止。窮人有的生了肺病，有的就死了。</p>
<p>幸虧，春天降臨得早。在廬森堡公園裏，孩子們仰起　白的臉　着太陽，女人坐在長椅上讓暖氣去融和那僵裂的腿。法國人是大然的忘憂派，至少在表面上是如此。咖啡館裏的桌子都搬了出來。夜總會開到深夜　兵也不來干涉。碼頭上書攤也漸漸增多，賣些舊書，舊地圖和五彩盡片。</p>
<p>十二月裏，德軍在亞登區反攻，巴黎人想起了八月裏德軍撤退時，說也門要到巴黎來過聖誕節，都很擔憂。等聯軍渡過來因河後，大家都知道大戰結束，不過是時間問題了。</p>
<p>但是快樂裏還帶來了悲哀。從歸來的戰俘和流亡者的口中，聽到了許多熟人的死亡。回來的人中有許多生着病，或是老得不認得了，有一個故事，悲哀中還帶些幽默。一個俘慮的妻子知道丈夫要回家，特地預備好雙份大菜，雙人床，還出去向隣人去借什麽東西。她才走開，可巧丈夫進來，一看情形，大起誤會，竟掉頭不顧而去。</p>
<p>戰事將結束時，法國和巴黎都已筋疲力盡。那時萬端待舉，處理乏人。貝當回來後，度他舒服的牢獄生活。戰前的總理像哈利歐，萊諾，和達拉第等也回來後，看了看政治情形，靜悄悄的坐下來寫自傳了。</p>
<p>戰事正式結束那天，下午三點鐘末次警報解除後，民衆們就在幾分抑制中開始慶祝起來。幾輛汽車和吉普車載滿了軍士和靑年馳過，還輕輕起歡呼着唱着歌。年紀大些的人們，互相望望，說道：『現在戰事結束啦，一切都該兩樣了，總該兩樣了吧？』</p>
<p>勝利那天晚上，民衆唯一表現出的心理就是希望。我們那晚走遍全城，所見俱如比。電燈很亮，人們都望着燈。近大劇院那裏，大羣的人在異樣的電燈光下走着。有幾個年輕男女還跳着舞。劇院門口的人都坐在石級上，不是看跳舞，不是互相觀望，是在看那燈。</p>
<p>回來時，我們經過和平廣塲。記得九個月之前的一個晚上，那裏正是慶祝德軍撤退狂歡的地方。我們過了靜悄悄的橋，在碼頭對面的衆議院停下米。祇見那墻上嵌着一小塊木板。綴了一枝丁香花，木板上刻着『克魯特·畢倫就義之處，一九四四年八月二十五日時年二十一歲。』</p>

<h3>名人的帽子</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>活躍在第二次世界大戰裏，有許多名人所載的帽子，也正和他們的名字一樣地輝煌出衆。這裏記的八頂帽子，便是讀者所熟知的著名人物的『商標』。</p>
<p>一頂有根狹帶子束着的輕便灰色呢帽，在杜魯門成爲美國大總統時始爲世人所知。</p>
<p>邱吉爾先生一頂高頂黑帽，他已用了好多年，正和他雪匣烟一樣，形影不離，爲全世界人士所熟悉。</p>
<p>蒙高茂萊將軍一直戴着那頂特別的法蘭西式軟帽，此帽過處，就有一幕光榮偉大的戰蹟表現出來。現在這頂軟帽，已和他的蔬食主義同樣齊名。</p>
<p>雖然失而復得者數次，且又經過砲火和槍彈的損壞，但史蒂威爾將軍仍珍愛這頂出衆的破帽，一直戴用着，甚至比他那副眼鏡更受人注目。</p>
<p>在美國，紐約市長拉圭達出現於社交塲面上時，他的尖頂黑帽常被人當作開玩笑的標記，這位好脾氣的市長很珍貴這帽子。</p>
<p>在獲得第四次的金星獎章之前，巴頓將軍所戴的圓形鋼盔早和他百發百中的射擊術一同成爲歐洲戰塲上的聞名逸話。</p>
<p>一個軍事領袖可以選用任何一種帽子樣式，幾年前麥克沃塞將軍選定他現在所用的一頂，是美國陸軍中最出名的樣式，大約早爲讀者所熟知了。</p>
<p>密契亞海軍　將在太平洋率領的美國艦隊，已給日本海軍不知多少次的痛擊。他常常是戴着一頂壘球式帽子來指揮作戰的。</p>

<h3>新毒鼠藥</h3>
<p>— 王燕祥</p>
<p>「安堵』Antu是一種老鼠毒藥的名稱，專門用以毒死老鼠的，毒性很强，一磅可以毒死三十萬頭老鼠，是美國巴爾第摩一醫院裏的心理病學家雷齊脫博士所發明。因爲戰時保守秘密，直到最近方始發表。</p>
<p>『安堵』由化學名稱的起首字母拼成，它的發明也很巧，是在心理實騐室裏作嚐味試騐時偶然發覺的。這是一種灰白色的細粉，稍有氣味，其毒性較砒霜大一百倍。但是它有兩大特點：（一）專毒老鼠，對人類無害。（二）引起老鼠的肺部的水腫而毒死之。</p>
<p>使用的方法也很簡單，只要將此粉和以穀麥之粉，　於水菓蔬菜，切開的蘋果，甜味的番薯，樓板，跑道，老鼠喜喝的飲料或其洞穴旁，便可以免除老鼠的騷擾了。如果有系統地利用它，即使最厲害的鼠疫也可於一二天之內消除。</p>
<p>巴爾第摩地方，雖然一再試騐，居民五十萬人都毫不受影響。狗或有中毒的可能，但狗對此藥有嘔吐作用，故少受害者，兎子亦不受影響，鷄則使吃一調羹亦無妨害。</p>
<p>目前解毒葉雖尙無發明，但雷齊脫博士主張用洗胃的方法。受害者不能給以液體，只需要氧氣的供給。</p>
<p>此藥因有助於戰爭，被視爲重要軍用品之一。因爲戰爭期內類似斑疹傷寒，鼠疫等病極形猖獗，都可以利用此藥來消治的。</p>
<h3>科學新訊</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>烟癮深的人對烟的反應怎樣，大家一向不大淸楚。最近醫學家們，經過許多次試騐，發現癮深的人看見烟後，血壓增高，脈搏加快，手脚皮面的濕度降低，心跳的速度亦爲改變。</p>
<p>蘇聯科學家移植靑蛙心臟，試騐已吿成功。蛙　用新的心臟後，繼續生活，達四個月之久。</p>

<h3>植物病</h3>
<p>— 于安</p>
<p>泥土中植物缺少什麽養料，祇有牠自己能詳細地訴說出來。化學能把泥土分析，而知道牠所含的元素，但是不能知道究竟每種元素的幾分之幾對植物是有用的。</p>
<p>科學家曾對菸業作了二十年的研究，從仔細觀察這植物根莖葉所顯示的病徵上，得到缺乏九種重要的植物滋養料的解答。</p>
<p>菸葉是一個最好的試騐品，因爲牠受到光的葉面很大。菸葉缺乏了鉀的病徴，和棉花的一鉀飢一病相仿。別的植物就不能這樣容易的顯示出植物的病徴來，只有從菸葉的病微，可以解答別種植物的營養缺乏病。</p>
<p>上面所說九種重要的植物滋養元素，就是　，磷，鉀，鎂，鈣，硼，硫，錳，和鐵。據麥茂屈萊博士說：植物缺少一種元素，不僅是長不大，並且還有一種特殊的變化。植物缺少氮時，變成一種淺綠的顏色，低部的葉子成黃色，乾了成一種淺褐色。缺少磷時，植物成暗綠色，葉子的寬度和長度與平常比起來要更狹一些，同時植物也長不大。</p>
<p>缺少鉀與鎂和缺少氮與磷同樣的影響及植物低部的葉子（老葉子），或者甚至於全株植物。缺少鈣，硼，　，硫，和鐵，在開始時，使植物上部的嫩葉受影響。璧如缺少鐵時，可以看出嫩葉少綠色，成一種萎黃症，主葉脈的綠色比葉片的綠色深。葉脈失去顏色後，業片就成白色或黃色。</p>
<p>經研究的結果，科學家發見從植物的下種到成熟，任一期間，都一樣的。植物本身的大小和年紀都與這種「營養缺乏」的病徵無關。</p>
<p>茂屈萊博士以這：一旦植物營業缺乏的問題解決，一切植物將變得康健一些，增强扺抗植物病和蟲害的能力。</p>
<p>博士又說：假使有個種菸者，能完全熟悉這種病微，那末他就能正確地診察出田地裏植物營養缺乏的病源，因爲他已知道植物的生活史，生活習慣，植物病和蟲害對植物的影響等等了。（酬移助學）</p>

<h3>地球高壽幾何？</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>關於地球的年齡，大約有四十種不同的估計，從一萬萬年一直到三十萬萬年。地質學者和物理學者都主張作長期的估計，因為地質學者須得說明年齡顯然是在一萬萬年以上的地層，而物理學者則因爲明曉得古岩石中的鉀變成鉛爲止至少需要四十六萬萬年。他們曾一度同意地球的年齡至少該是二十尤萬年或三十萬萬年。雖然兩者相差頗遠，可是這並不是隨意的推測。鉀是一個正確的時計，它和將之藏包的岩石毫無關係地按照一定的速度崩壞着。結果它在預定期間變爲鉛。</p>
<p>不幸鈾並不是一個時計，而是同時開動的八個時計，因爲地球上一共有八種鈾，（照物理學者說起來，就是所謂『同位元素」），以不同的速度變成十六種鉛。徼倖這十六種鉛，可以追本溯源，獲悉它們之母體的鈾。八個時計中只有一個時計多少表示着正確的時間，照它算起來，地球的年齡大的是二十萬萬年。</p>
<p>成爾金及雷頓博士向美國科學協進會所提出的報吿，和這估計並不相差多遠。利用鉀的八種同位原素之一的銅鈾（鈾之最後變成鉛者）爲時計，他們獲得二十五萬萬年的新的更正確的估計。五萬萬年的差數，照我們看起來，似乎很大，可是倘使我們把地球經某遊星的吸引，從太陽中吸出來所經過的悠久期間算在裏面，這並不能算是多長的。天體物理學者一定會感謝威爾金和雷頓博士，終於把這啞謎解決了。在這高唱宇宙膨脹論的今日，遊星和地球的年齡對於他們極關重要的。因爲他們除非正確地知道地球以及太陽的年齡，他們決不能壓服竭力主張地球比遊星年靑的相對論者。</p>

<p>— 珍珠　朱綺</p>
<p>他想：『讓她把胃裏的東西吐空了也好。』他忘了她從不曾看過施手術。可是她的痛苦和他目己的不能過去看看她，使他對這死了一般的睡在他刀下的人不耐煩而又暴燥起來。</p>
<p>他想道：『這個人，天底下就找不出一個要讓他活着的理由來。』</p>
<p>這念頭使他不知不覺地殘忍起來，動作得很快。這人在夢中呻吟起來，貞雄也不去注意他，祗喃喃說道：</p>
<p>『喊吧，你高興喊就喊。我不是因爲自已高興才來給你開刀的。老實說，我自己都不知道爲什麼。』</p>
<p>門開了，花子走了進來。她一點都不停留，連散亂了的頭髮都不去摸一下。</p>
<p>她用一種淸晰的聲音問：『麻醉藥在那裏？』</p>
<p>貞雄動動下巴說：『你回來得正好，這傢伙正在開始動了。』她手裏拿了麻醉藥和一點棉花。</p>
<p>她問道：『我怎樣弄呢？』</p>
<p>貞雄答道：『祇要將棉花浸了麻醉藥，移近他的鼻孔就是，如果他的呼吸急促起來，就將棉花拿開些。』他說時並沒將手裏在做的複雜的手術稍停一下。</p>
<p>她蹲在這年輕的美國人的昏睡着的臉旁邊。她想，這是個瘦得可憐的臉　嘴唇扭曲着。不管這人自己知道不知道，他總是在受苦的。看着他，她心裏有些懷疑起來，不知她有時聽到的那些關於囚犯的痛苦的故事可是眞有其事。看報時，上面祇記載着日軍所到之處，人民是如何的因爲得了解放而歡呼。但有時她記起了像瀧間將軍一類的人，在家裏打起老婆來好不殘忍，目從他在柬北打了一次勝仗以後，現在是沒有人再提起這事了。如果一個橡他這樣的人，能對待一個在他權力之下的女人如此殘忍，難道他對待像這白種人之類的人時會不殘忍嗎？</p>
<p>她懇切地希望這個年輕人不曾受過虐待。正在此時，她看見他的頸上有着深紅的創痕，正在耳朶下面。她抬起眼睛望望貞雄，輕輕地說：『這些一創痕。』</p>
<p>可是他不回答。這時他覺得他的儀器的一頭碰到了一些硬的東西，很有碰到腎臟的危險。一切思想都離開了他。他所感到的祗是純悴的快樂。他輕輕地用手指探索着，對這個人身體上的每一個訓胞都是熟悉的。敎他解剖學的美國老敎授最注重這事。『諸位，對人體知識的缺欠是外科醫生最大的罪惡！』他年復一年地在上課時喊道『在施行手術時，如果對那身體沒有熟悉到好像是你目己造出來的一般，這就是殺人。』</p>
<p>貞雄輕輕地說：『還沒有碰到腎臟，我的刖友。』常他在施行手術忘了自己時，他有這種對病人喃喃輕語的習慣。他常呌他的病人『我的朋友，』所以現在他也這樣時了，忘記了道是他的敵人。</p>
<h3>社會服務　為海上職業界　解決行的問題</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>節省寶踐的光陰　增進工作的效率</p>
<p>「遵守時刻」，爲公衆美德之一，然而一般人往往不能遵守，深爲遺憾！譬如九時集會，待至十時半尙未到齊，祇好延長開會時間，多數等候少數，於是開一次會，就得費了半天功夫，時間太不經濟，這是尋常習見的事。有的人不諒解，總說不遵時刻，浪費別人寳貴的光陰，也是不道德的行爲。其實這也應該原諒，失約的人，未嘗不想守的，問題在於交通工具的不够應付。目前坐汽車的人，究屬少數，普通人總利用電車及人力車，可是人力車三輪車索價太貴，薪水階級的公務員及工商界從業員，已是不敢問津，而大衆可乘的電車，公共汽車，又是擠得不堪，使大家望車興嘆！這不但使人開會不能守的，而且要影響到辦公約工作效率。寫字問九點鐘開始工作，也多因車擠而誤點，即使上了車，也擠得透不轉氣來。凡是上海的職業界，誰都有此困難吧？</p>
<p>本欄以服務社會爲職志，對此大衆不能解決的困難，很想設法解決，一是平晨由西區向東區，一是每晚由東區回西區，成千成萬的人，怎樣可以解決行的問題？我現在設計一個辦法，希望交通當局設法辦理，計劃是：每晨八時至十時，在霞飛路底及靜安寺加放電車，連續開出，使向東區上寫字間的人，不致無車可乘。至晚四至七時，相反的在外灘加放電車，不斷的向西行駛，萬一車輛不够的話，還有一個計劃，是：請公用局特備公共汽車數十輛，開「辦公專車」，每晨八至十時在靜安寺，福煦路海格路以，及霞飛路底，三處運續向東開行，每晚四至七時，相反的在南京路，中正路，公館馬路外灘等三處，連續向西開行，免得乘客擁擠，除此以外，是否有更好的計劃，還請讀者指敎，並望公用局與電車公司當局，詳加研究，以解除市民行路的困難。因爲節省寳貴的光陰，便是增進工作的效率！（本問題歡迎讀者意見）</p>
<h3>重振道德的我見</h3>
<p>— 永玉</p>
<p>在戰爭時期，「道德先生放了學」，所以道德日見低落，現在我國抗戰勝利，重振道德運動，實在是建國時候的一個重要工作，茲將永玉對於重振道德運動的兩個意見，寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）輿論制裁　輿論的力量，可以左右社會，關於重振道德運動，我希望由輿論界來領導，督促大家走向重振道總的路上去。對於目前奢侈的消耗，能使靑年墮落，道德淪亡的不正當娛樂塲所，希望輿論界加以制裁。又關於一般商人的不道德行爲，希望興論界加以揭發，同時撲滅近來上海無謂的應酬交際的風氣。</p>
<p>（二）安定民生　物價高漲，生活不安定，是提倡重振道德的一個大障得，現在我們要「重振道德」，使國家社會進入有秩序的良好境界，成功一個獨立自由民主的國家，使人民大家有道德心，享受物質文明，我想抑平物價，安定民生，實在是先決的條件</p>

<h3>Hurley Suddenly Resigns; Marshall Appointed Special Envoy to China; Sino-American Cooperation Will Become Closer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th, United Press] The White House announced that former Army Chief of Staff General of the Army Marshall would succeed General Hurley as the envoy to China. General of the Army Marshall will go to China as the Ambassador with the status of President Truman's special envoy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th, Reuters] The U.S. government announced that General of the Army Marshall's succession to General Hurley as the envoy to China is of a temporary nature. He can use this to carry out his special mission. General of the Army Marshall has served as the U.S. Army Chief of Staff since 1939 and was previously the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe. General of the Army Eisenhower succeeded General of the Army Marshall as Army Chief of Staff last week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] According to the US News Service, Washington, 27th, the US Presidential Press Secretary Ross told reporters this evening that General of the Army Marshall will retain the title of Five-Star General during his temporary special mission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The new U.S. Ambassador to China, General Marshall, today visited President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes for instructions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] After Major General Hurley, the U.S. Ambassador to China, resigned, President Truman did not choose a civilian diplomat but chose General Marshall, a five-star general, to succeed Hurley, who only had two stars, indicating that his policy seems to have advanced further. The main task of the U.S. military in China may no longer be limited to disarming the Japanese army. The State Department and the War Department have repeatedly stated in recent weeks that the deployment of U.S. troops to North China is only to facilitate the surrender of the Japanese army and not as a tool of U.S. foreign policy. Before Hurley resigned, U.S. policy toward China was closely reviewed due to the risk of the U.S. military being drawn into the Chinese civil war. Therefore, when the new ambassador, General Marshall, travels from Washington to Chongqing to take office, President Truman can obtain new information on the Chinese situation from two aspects. One is that Under Secretary of the Navy Gates has returned from the Far East and will arrive in the U.S. capital soon. Gates told reporters in Pearl Harbor that he would submit proposals to the President that would affect U.S. policy toward China. The second is that President Truman's personal representative, Locke, who came to China on an economic mission, has also departed from Chongqing to return to China after a two-month investigation. According to reports from Chongqing, General Marshall can make a decisive decision on whether the U.S. military should remain in China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] After U.S. Ambassador to China Hurley resigned, President Truman immediately appointed General Marshall as the special envoy to China. Washington officials said that this move shows that the U.S. government attaches great importance to resolving the disputes in the Far East. Republican Senator Capehart of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said: "General Marshall will be able to resolve the Chinese situation immediately, and his appointment will surely be passed unanimously by the Senate. Marshall is the most outstanding and capable leader in the country, and President Truman could not have made a wiser choice. It can be asserted that General Marshall will succeed in this trip." Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming said that he had not yet received an official announcement and therefore did not want to comment. This time, Hurley's resignation and Marshall's succession came in quick succession, shocking people in the U.S. capital. According to the White House, Hurley's sudden resignation was unexpected, and Marshall's appointment will carry out some special work that is currently needed in China. It is expected that Marshall will set off for Chongqing to take office in the near future. Under Secretary of State McDermott told reporters that Hurley had expressed his intention to resign yesterday, and Secretary of State Byrnes persuaded him to change his mind and return to China to resume his post. Hurley had already agreed. Byrnes visited President Truman this evening, and the State Department and the Joint Army and Navy Liaison Committee also met today to determine U.S. policy in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Hurley Issues Resignation Statement; Criticizes U.S. Foreign Policy; Supporting the Warmongering Group is No Different from Destroying Democracy; Suggests Public Announcement to Help China Seek Stability</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] After resigning as U.S. Ambassador to China, Hurley issued a formal statement accusing the United States of using Lend-Lease materials and the nation's reputation as tools to end the war in the Far East, aiming only to support imperialism and communism, which is no different from destroying democracy. The professionalized U.S. foreign policy is biased toward the Chinese Communist Party and imperialist groups, causing internal division in China. U.S. professional diplomats have repeatedly told the Chinese Communist Party that my policy of supporting the National Government does not represent U.S. policy. Although our authorities have a clear definition of the U.S. goals, they often go against them when dealing with foreign affairs. At the beginning of our declaration of war, we called for the maintenance of the Atlantic Charter and democratic principles, but the way of fighting is contrary to the professed democratic principles. The weakness and incompetence of American diplomacy has caused the country to be involved in war twice, but it still does not know how to change. Now a third world war is brewing, and I absolutely uphold the principles of democracy and freedom. During World War I, we declared that democracy must be able to exist safely in the world. During World War II, these slogans were also seen in the Atlantic Charter and the Tehran Declaration. Although both wars resulted in victory, the principle of fighting to the end has never been established. U.S. diplomats, due to internal divisions, have been exploited by other countries, who have taken our material assistance with sweet words and secret promises. The war that is now brewing does not even take the protection of democracy as its principle and purpose. The United States not only cannot back up the United Nations Charter, but also actively supports the imperialist group, and a large part of the U.S. State Department advocates universal support for communism, especially the Chinese Communist Party. Hurley then stated that the U.S. activities in Asia should have expanded publicity, especially in China and other countries where he has served for the past four years. There should be more real publicity in many aspects so that there will be no misunderstandings about us abroad, and the most important thing is to make the diplomatic and economic policies of the United States consistent. We should use the strength of the country to support the United Nations resolutions, and never support conflicting doctrines and warmongering groups.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] After resigning as Ambassador to China, Hurley suggested to the State Department that it publicly announce its policy toward China and "clearly state that the United States will stabilize China until the United Nations organization can take responsibility." At the same time, he congratulated General of the Army Marshall on his appointment as a special envoy to China, believing that this appointment "will be of great benefit to the situation."</p>
<p>For Mr. Hurley</p>
<h3>General of the Army Marshall, Special Envoy to China</h3>
<p>[Drafted by this newspaper's data room] General Marshall, who is known throughout the world, has now been appointed as the special envoy of the United States to China. It is indeed an unprecedented initiative in American diplomacy for a military officer of the rank of five-star general to be sent as an envoy to a foreign country. This point is especially worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>General Marshall just resigned as Chief of Staff last week, and he has been hailed as "the person who led the United States to victory." His full name is George Catlett. Marshall. He was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania on December 31, 1880, and is already 65 years old this year.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that he has been ordered to China. During the Chinese National Revolution from 1924 to 1927, he was also ordered by the War Department to come to China and served as the commander of the 15th Infantry Regiment in Tianjin. Therefore, he has a very deep understanding of the process and success of the Chinese Revolution.</p>
<p>He was the first person to receive this special honor when the United States established the five-star general rank on December 16 last year, when he was launching the final attack on Germany. The establishment of this military rank by the U.S. Congress is unprecedented in American history, and the reason for giving this military rank to General Marshall is to reward this great military man with appropriate honors for his achievements for the country.</p>
<p>After the United States was dragged into the war on December 7, 1941, General Marshall formed an expeditionary force that traveled across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres and six continents. In addition, he also created air transport divisions, parachute units, and bulldozer units. These new units were things that military personnel had never dreamed of before. In the Allied Joint Chiefs of Staff, he supported the armies of other United Nations countries fighting around the world, made brilliant contributions, and promoted the early collapse of the Axis countries. His brilliant achievements have made the U.S. Army today a thoroughly modernized military force. Marshall's name and his outstanding leadership will be immortalized in history.</p>
<p>During the war, he maintained close cooperation with Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, and overcame the various difficulties caused by the vastness of the Pacific in the war against Japan. He used his outstanding ingenuity to transport reinforcements, weapons, and supplies from the United States through long transportation lines to their destinations according to plan, advancing from the Central Pacific to recover the Philippine Islands, and finally forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally to the Allies, completing its historical mission and laying the foundation for establishing lasting peace in the world in the future.</p>
<p>He is the most beloved leader of his subordinates. Brigadier General Piersons, Congressional Liaison Officer, once said that General Marshall "is indeed the most suitable person I have ever known to hold a military position in a democracy." Whether it is the Senate or the House of Representatives, whether it is the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, everyone places complete trust in General Marshall and no one needs to testify for him, because he is extremely cautious in his dealings, has no personal ambitions, and can accept the opinions of others, so everyone believes that he is a symbolic figure who guarantees American security.</p>
<p>Although he is the most famous military man in the United States, he is not a graduate of West Point, because when he took the entrance exam at the age of seventeen, he could not find a Congressman to be his guarantor, so he was rejected. As a result, he went to the Virginia Military Institute to realize his military aspirations. He did not obtain a degree in Uniontown either. In his freshman year at the military school, he was only ranked 35th, and when he graduated, he was only ranked 15th. After graduating from the Fort Leavenworth Staff School in 1906, he began to join the army. Later, he was transferred to the Philippine Islands. When he held an exercise to defend Manila, he wrote to General Bell (Chief of Staff from 1906 to 1910) to state his defense plan, which was appreciated by Bell, who believed that he was a rare staff talent. At the end of World War I, he transported 600,000 people in France in two weeks without any losses, which was praised by General Pershing. After the armistice, he served as an aide under General Pershing for five years. In 1937, he was promoted to Brigadier General and was appointed as the Commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade. In 1938, he was transferred to the War Plans Division of the General Staff. In the spring of 1939, President Roosevelt promoted him to Acting Chief of Staff. On September 1, 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland, he was appointed as Chief of Staff and awarded the rank of Four-Star General. On November 26, 1944, President Roosevelt awarded him the Oak Leaf Medal, and on December 5, Congress passed his promotion to Five-Star General. After the end of World War II, he requested retirement due to old age, and his resignation was approved last week.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Marshall's Arrival in China Will Surely Be Welcomed by Our Government and Public</h3>
<p>Ambassador Wei Daoming Visits Truman [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 pm on the 28th, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Deputy Minister Liu Kai. The main questions and answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Q: Ambassador Hurley has resigned, and General of the Army Marshall has been appointed as the special envoy. What is the reaction from the Chinese side? Has the official heard about the date of General of the Army Marshall's arrival in China? A: Ambassador Hurley is a true and great friend of China. It is regrettable that Hurley has resigned. General of the Army Marshall is a famous American general of our time. His arrival in China as a special envoy will surely be welcomed by our government and the public. President Chiang has invited General of the Army Marshall to visit China several times, and he is confident that President Chiang's meeting with Marshall will be very pleasant. As for the exact date of General of the Army Marshall's arrival in China, I have not heard anything.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming expressed his regret upon hearing that Major General Hurley had left his post as Ambassador to China. Wei also said: "Hurley made great contributions to promoting closer relations between China and the United States. The new Ambassador, General Marshall, will surely strengthen the close relations between the two countries in peacetime."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] According to the US News Service, Washington, 27th, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming visited President Truman today to discuss general issues in the Far East. He told reporters afterward that China did not intend to ask the United States to assist in resolving China's domestic problems. He told reporters at the White House that the current situation in China has "more clamor than gunfire" and believes that it can eliminate general disagreements "peacefully."</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui, Chiang Ching-kuo, etc., Await Opportunity to Return to Changchun</h3>
<p>National Army Less Than 300 Li from Shenyang</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 28th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, and Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Envoy for Northeast Foreign Affairs, are now waiting for a flight to Peiping and then to Changchun. Other receiving personnel are also preparing to depart. As for the receiving personnel returning to Beiping, some have already returned to Changchun. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has requested to jointly develop Northeast minerals and other economic undertakings with our country. The reporter inquired about the matter from Zhang Jia'ao today. Zhang replied that the Soviet Union did not make such a request, and the rumors are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 28th] The Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters has moved to Xingcheng along with the advance of the National Army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] According to authoritative sources in diplomatic circles today, an agreement has been established between Chongqing and Moscow allowing the National Army to use the Shenyang and Changchun airfields to quickly travel to the Northeast by air. It is reported that the National Army has passed Miyun and is advancing toward Gubeikou. According to this agreement, Chinese officials can immediately return to Changchun to receive the areas they had previously withdrawn from due to the threat of the Communist Army. Military sources said that the National Army stationed in Beiping will be the first batch of National Army to be transported to the Northeast by air.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 28th] The National Army has entered the three eastern provinces and is reportedly less than 300 li from Pan Yang. According to reports received here, Communist Army Commander Zhu De has arrived in Shenyang to arrange defenses and prepare for a fierce battle with the National Army. The reporter inquired with the Peiping office of the Northeast Security Command but was unable to confirm this statement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] It was announced here that the National Army arrived in Jinzhou on the 26th, and there are still about 100 Japanese aircraft at the county's airfield. Also, the Beining Railway is now open to Jin County.</p>
<h3>China and the United States Sign Contract to Build a Large Sluice Gate to Develop the Yangtze River Conservancy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Secretary of the Interior Ickes announced that the U.S. authorities have signed a contract with the National Resources Commission of China, under which U.S. engineers will formulate a plan to build an unprecedentedly large concrete and steel-reinforced sluice gate in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to control the water and save tens of millions of residents in the Yangtze River basin from the perennial ice disasters and famines that have occurred for centuries. The water stored in this sluice gate can also be used to generate electricity. The Chinese government will pay US$500,000 as a technical assistance fund. At the same time, the plan is scheduled to build multiple other sluice gates and excavate thousands of miles of canals for irrigation and other facilities. All planning is supervised by Savage, an American sluice gate design expert, who spent several months in China in 1944 studying the Yangtze River Conservancy plan. The development of this plan will take 25 years and includes a plan to build the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. The sluice gate will be able to control the water and improve navigation. In the future, ocean-going vessels may be able to sail directly to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Political Consultative Conference Representative Zhang Zhizhong Stays in Dihua; Wu Tiecheng Appointed Instead</h3>

It is reported that Wu Tiecheng has been reassigned to fill his seat.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer and Barbey Fly to Chongqing to Meet with Chairman Chiang to Discuss Sino-American Military Affairs in North China; Locke Goes to Tianjin and Will Return to Shanghai in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 28th] U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Barbey and U.S. Forces China Commander Lieutenant General Wedemeyer flew to Chongqing together today to consult with Chairman Chiang. Barbey has been staying in Shanghai for several days since being appointed Commander of the Seventh Fleet. Last weekend, he and Paulley, President Truman's personal representative responsible for reparations, were in Chongqing. It was also announced here that Vice Admiral Barbey's flagship, the USS Estes, is now in Qingdao and will soon sail to Qinhuangdao, where Barbey will go to personally direct the ship's activities in North China. The trip of these two American generals to Chongqing today seems unexpected. Although their mission is unknown, it is clearly related to the U.S. military in North China. Brigadier General Locke, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in North China, has also consulted with Barbey here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer and Vice Admiral Barbey, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, arrived in Chongqing from Shanghai at 4:30 pm on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] General Locke, Commander of the US Marine Corps in North China, left Shanghai yesterday (28th) to return to Tianjin. After arriving in Shanghai, Locke met with General Wedemeyer, Commander of the China Theater, General Stratemeyer, Commander of the US Air Force in China, and General Barbey, Commander of the US Navy in China. According to Locke, he and Barbey talked for several hours, but the content was not convenient to disclose. Locke also said that the situation in Tianjin is not very peaceful, and there are no pedestrians on the streets after nightfall. After Locke and his Chief of Staff, General Wootton, return to Tianjin this time, they may come to Shanghai again in the near future.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The US Changes its Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news from Washington D.C. stated that US Ambassador to China, General Hurley, has resigned. General Marshall has been appointed as President Truman's special envoy to China to succeed him as ambassador. Another report stated that General Marshall has agreed to undertake a special mission for the US President. Simultaneously, after resigning, Ambassador Hurley issued a formal statement, saying that US foreign policy has been hindered by certain career diplomats. This seems to be the reason for his resignation. Various news reports, up to the present, have been vague and do not provide a basis for judgment. However, before this change of US Ambassador to China, there must have been deep discussions on China policy. The fact that President Truman has specially appointed General Marshall, who has just retired as Chief of Staff, to succeed General Hurley, gives us strong confidence that the US policy towards China, which it has always adhered to, will not only continue consistently but will also be implemented more vigorously.</p>
<p>First of all, we deeply regret that Ambassador Hurley has resigned and will not return to China. Sent by the late President Roosevelt, Mr. Hurley initially had a special mission, which later changed to being ambassador. His enthusiasm and perseverance in assisting China to achieve victory, promoting an agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and hoping that China would embark on the path of democratic and peaceful reconstruction, were widely acknowledged by both Chinese and foreign observers. Although our country has now won the war and the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to convene, the National Government's work of accepting surrender has not yet been fully completed, and economic reconstruction is just beginning. Mr. Hurley, however, suddenly resigned and will not return because his ambitions could not be fully realized. We feel like we were gradually entering a better situation, but a good friend has departed. Fortunately, his successor is General Marshall. General Marshall is not only a military genius, but also has an outstanding and constant flow of ideas. He is by nature frank and sincere, taking pleasure in understanding and helping others. His contribution in building the US continental army to safeguard global democratic politics is particularly admired worldwide. He is now sent to China with a special mission. We greatly admire President Truman's ability to recognize and appoint talent, and we particularly admire and welcome General Marshall's willingness to accept this new mission at this time.</p>
<p>US foreign policy is inherently clear, and its policy towards China is especially consistent. President Truman's Navy Day speech on October 27th provided a detailed elaboration. His grand vision of maintaining world peace and opposing any aggression will be relentlessly pursued with a strong military force. In the Far East, he will undoubtedly be pleased to see a strong, prosperous, and democratic China, working hand in hand to share the responsibility of maintaining peace. There is no need for us to elaborate further on this. However, since Ambassador Hurley has recognized the weakness of the US diplomatic authorities and believes that the failure of US policy in Asia is the reason for his resignation, at this time of change of envoys, it would be somewhat beneficial to express our views on Sino-US relations and frankly say a few words to our US allies.</p>
<p>When the great powers attempted to carve up China, John Hay put forward the Open Door Policy, preserving the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. This laid the initial foundation for US policy towards China. Later, during World War I, Japan attempted to gain a unique position in China. Therefore, after the end of the war, the United States convened the Washington Conference, reaffirming the policy of guaranteeing the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. Japan disregarded the sanctity of treaties, attempting to create a deceptive "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" by force, which directly conflicted with US national policy, ultimately leading to World War II. Therefore, supporting a China with complete territorial sovereignty should be the backbone of US Asian policy. To be friends with the Chinese people, it is necessary to assist the National Government, which is universally supported by the people. Therefore, supporting the National Government should be the core of US policy towards China. Former Secretary of State Hull recently stated: "(1) Our solemn obligation is to cooperate with China and preserve its territorial integrity. (2) We have always been friends of China, and China has a population of 400 million. (3) We support international cooperation and the policy of seeking peaceful solutions to international disputes. (4) As early as 1936, we declared that one country's act of aggression is inextricably linked to the interests of all countries. We could have retired to our homes, but I do not want to face you today by recounting what will happen after we retire." This clarification of the US position is extremely frank.</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People in China are somewhat in line with the American democratic tradition of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The nation-building efforts of the Chinese people are to establish a new China with complete territorial sovereignty, prosperity, happiness, and embracing the democratic spirit of Western Europe. In this arduous task, the Chinese people hope to receive full support from the United States. This is just as the United States received support from revolutionary France in its early days of nation-building. The difficulties China encounters in its nation-building work are just like the difficulties the United States encountered in its early days, so only the United States can truly understand. In the current stage of China, although our political democracy has not yet reached the ideal state, this is precisely the goal of all our current efforts. In the social aspect, the democratic customs of the Chinese people are essentially no different from those of the United States. Therefore, the Chinese people have always regarded the United States as a friend. It may not be an exaggeration to say that there is no greater harmony of genuine feelings between peoples than between the Chinese and American people.</p>
<p>The traditional friendship, coupled with the profound alliance of fighting side by side to defeat the enemy this time, makes the relationship between China and the United States extremely close. Although armed conflict in the Pacific has ended, the war is not completely over. Although current US policy may inevitably encounter some obstacles, as Ambassador Hurley said, the US policy towards China adopted by the US government to date is generally approved by the Chinese people. This policy is to maintain and support the National Government led by Chairman Chiang, and to assist the National Army in accepting surrender and taking over territories. We know that the Chinese should strive to help themselves, but at the same time, we also know that the US military's execution of this task is based on its own position. The enemies of China are originally the enemies of the United States, and the United States has the obligation to assist China as an ally. Unfortunately, those who incite rebellion are hindering the National Army's work of accepting surrender and taking over territories. They hope to do whatever they want, obstruct the National Government from completing the task of accepting surrender and restoring local order, and even fabricate rumors that the US military is participating in China's civil war, hoping to confuse the public and achieve the goal of withdrawing US troops. Today, we want to point out that this kind of ulterior motive cannot represent the opinion of the majority of the Chinese people. Our US allies will surely see through it. Should the US troops currently stationed in China immediately retire to their homes? One only needs to see if the Japanese troops have been completely disarmed and sent back to their country. It would be unwise to fail to examine the facts and want to return to the old path of isolationism.</p>
<p>In short, based on the traditional friendship between China and the United States, and based on the traditional national policy of the United States, the Chinese people hope that after General Marshall arrives in China, the United States will be able to strengthen its support for the National Government. This is not only China's only legitimate government but is also supported by the majority of the Chinese people. What the Chinese people hope is to realize their ideals of nation-building under the National Government. In this arduous task, we need the cooperation of our allies, especially the United States, which shares similar ideals of nation-building. We deeply believe that General Marshall, for the sake of the consistent national policy of the United States, will be able to fulfill our wishes and prepare to write a precious page in Chinese history and in human history.</p>

<h3>Representatives of British and French Governments Hold Talks in London; Exchange Views on Colonial Issues; British Government to Announce Policy on India Soon</h3>
<p>[Paris (Reuters), 28th] The British and French governments simultaneously issued a communique stating that representatives of the two governments recently held talks in London on colonial issues. Laurentie, Director of Political Affairs of the French Colonial Ministry, recently went to London to exchange views with the British Colonial Ministry on administrative and technical issues related to colonial territories.

<h3>British Conservative Party Impeaches Government, Criticizing Inappropriate Post-War Measures</h3>
<p>[London (Reuters), 28th] The British Conservative Party today submitted a motion of impeachment against the Labour government in the House of Commons. Signed by Conservative leader Churchill and others, the motion states that the Labour government has neglected its primary responsibilities and failed to concentrate its efforts on several urgent and important tasks, such as converting war industries to peaceful industries, solving housing problems, rapidly reducing male and female soldiers, and minimizing treasury expenditures. The House of Commons considers this extremely regrettable. At the same time, ministers in various government departments, misled by socialist theories, plan to launch a nationalization program for enterprises, which seems extremely inappropriate for industrial and commercial activities and greatly contrary to national interests.</p>
<p>House of Lords Begins Foreign Policy Debate</p>
<p>[London (United Press), 27th] The British House of Lords will debate foreign policy today and tomorrow. At today's meeting, both Conservative and Labour Party members supported US control of the atomic bomb, but requested that countries reduce suspicion and make the non-reservation of atomic bomb secrets a condition. During the debate, members of both parties deeply regretted the secrecy and [suspicion] towards the Soviet Union. Viscount Cranborne regarded it as [splitting] Asian power, dividing two cultures. Cranborne said, "As a Conservative [Lord], I do not expect to be compatible with the Soviet system. However, no one in any party does not hope for friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the new situation between Western countries and the Soviet Union caused by the atomic bomb makes us particularly regretful."</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Organization Progressing Smoothly; Report on the Transfer of League of Nations Work Opposed by Representatives of Soviet Union and Australia by Vote</h3>
<p>[London (Reuters), 28th] The Technical Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Organization today discussed the Executive Committee's report on the transfer of League of Nations work. The report was opposed by representatives of the Soviet Union and Australia by vote in the Executive Committee, because it contained the meaning of mutual succession between the old League of Nations and the new United Nations. At today's meeting, several speaking committee members held hopeful views, believing that most of the differences in opinion were a matter of wording, such as using phrases like "re-implementing activities" instead of "transfer," which could be avoided. The Preparatory Committee is being held in the Westminster Church Room. The impression of reporters this morning was that the group meeting stage of the Preparatory Committee's work has made a good start and is progressing very smoothly. The Eight-Member Committee also discussed general issues related to the United Nations General Assembly and further suggested the location of the permanent headquarters. Representatives from cities wishing to be the location of the permanent headquarters, who have been contacted, are already on their way to London.

<p>Son of Former Secretary of State for India</p>
<p>British Attorney General Sir Hartley Shawcross flew back from the Nuremberg International Tribunal specifically to represent the British monarch and attend the hearing. John Amery, wearing a brown coat and a yellow-black striped tie, leaned against the [rail] in the defendant's dock, smiling frequently. When he admitted his crimes, the audience stood up to look at this person who considered himself a national traitor. John Amery's face showed no expression, only occasionally forcing a smile. When the death sentence was announced, he fixed his gaze on the judge, bowed, and retreated.</p>
<p>[Paris (United Press), 27th] French traitor Paul Marion, who had worked for the German army during the occupation with notorious actions, was sentenced to death by a French court today.</p>
<h3>American Women Study Industrial Design</h3>
<p>Before the United States entered the war, home furniture and equipment were mostly designed by men. After joining the war, many men were transferred overseas for service, and this industrial design work was taken over by young women, which not only filled the labor shortage but also greatly increased domestic productivity. Now, in order to maintain the production plan after the war, the United States is still actively providing young women with industrial design technology training. The illustration shows a special training [class] in the Industrial Design Department of the Chicago Art Academy, educating them with industrial design technology and knowledge. During the past four years of the war, women's participation in industrial equipment has enabled men who originally performed this work to be transferred for service. The illustration shows the academy training women how to engage in drawing artistic patterns and learning manufacturing methods. All of its furniture and other products are well-received by the general public because of their exquisite designs.</p>
<h3>Konoe and Tojo Should Be Responsible for the War of Aggression; Saito Angrily Argues Before the Japanese Parliament; Militarism Led to the Collapse of Japan</h3>
<p>[Tokyo (United Press), 28th] At the Japanese Parliament meeting this morning, Saito, an elder of the Progressive Party, at the age of 75, raised a serious question in the House of Peers this morning, stating that the Japanese people are complaining about former Prime Ministers Tojo and Konoe. Tojo has been listed as a war criminal and arrested, while Konoe is still at large. He asked the reason why. Saito's remarks were made after Prime Minister Shidehara briefly announced the Japanese government's policies and guidelines. It is said that Tojo and Konoe should bear full responsibility for this war that evolved from the "China Incident." Before the outbreak of the war, Konoe refused to negotiate with Chairman Chiang. China is now one of the world's major powers, but Konoe is still safe and sound today, which is ridiculous. At this point in Saito's speech, one member interjected, saying that Konoe's diet is very good. Saito continued, Konoe should have known long ago that Japan's protests against British and American aid to China would be ineffective. This protest led to inauspicious negotiations between Japan and the United States in Washington, which ultimately led to the Pearl Harbor incident. Saito then addressed Minister of the Army Shimomura, asking him to explain why the warlords caused this war. He said, "This is our last chance to explain to the public why militarism can lead to war." Shimomura, wearing plain clothes, replied that military intervention in politics was one of the major causes of this war, and that some military leaders were indeed unsatisfactory. The Japanese military led the country to such a tragic state, and the responsibility is too great to be expressed in words. I bow to the nation in apology. After Shimomura sat down, the members again shouted for Minister of the Navy Yonai to speak, and some joked, wondering what the navy had done. Yonai, wearing a naval uniform, remained silent in his seat. Shidehara denied that he had stated that the entire Japanese people should bear the responsibility for the war, and said that his remarks were misunderstood, and the members said, "Why didn't you deny it at the time?"</p>
<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Arrives in Nuremberg</h3>
<p>To Serve as Chief Prosecutor for War Crimes Trials</p>
<p>[Nuremberg (Central News Agency Special Telegram), 27th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky arrived here on the afternoon of the 27th to serve as the Soviet chief prosecutor for the war crimes trials. He arrived from Moscow on the afternoon of the 23rd.</p>
<p>Nazi War Criminal Hess Shows No Signs of Mental Illness</p>
<p>[Nuremberg (Reuters), 28th] Authorities officially announced that Hess's neurological state is normal and shows no signs of mental illness. However, he is mentally unstable, has delusions of taking poison, and his failure in his mission to England has worsened his mood, leading to a suicide attempt. In addition, he still has obvious hysterical tendencies, such as the loss of memory from November 1943 to June 1944, which is one of its signs. In short, strictly speaking, there is currently no mental illness.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 28th] President Truman's reparations representative, Bau Lai, has returned to Tokyo after a ten-day trip to China.

Bau Lai stated: "We applied to the Soviet government for permission to enter Korea on the 16th of this month, but have not yet received a reply. We still hope to receive a satisfactory answer. As for the Eastern Three Provinces, we are now eagerly awaiting developments to determine which of our guarantors will reside there." Bau Lai inspected several factories in China and agreed with the Chinese government and the U.S. military authorities in China to establish an agency to estimate the number of Japanese assets in China and to determine their nature.

Bau Lai explicitly stated that this was a limit set by him personally and has not yet been decided by international discussion.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] After the outbreak of war in the Dutch East Indies, our government has expressed great concern about the safety of overseas Chinese in the region.

<h3>Chen You Cup Basketball: Desheng Defeats V Team, Green Forest Defeats Overseas Chinese, Friendship Match Shows Excellent Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhongqing Ballroom was lively for a while, because in addition to the two A-group matches, a friendship match between Hualian and the American military police team was added. With three matches, it is no wonder that fans flocked to it.</p>
<p>As a result of the two league matches, Green Forest defeated Overseas Chinese with a score of 34 to 21, but the first half was tied at ten points each, and the game remained evenly matched. Green Forest was fortunate to have a better late burst, finally defeating the enemy in the last five minutes.</p>
<p>In the battle between Desheng and V Team, V Team had sufficient coordination, but its skills were inferior. In the end, it could not defeat Desheng's tiger generals, who were rich in both skills and experience, and suffered a tragic defeat with a score of 27 to 34. The first half was evenly matched, with each team sharing the spoils at fourteen points.</p>
<p>In the finale performance match between Hualian and the 117th Battalion of the American Military Police, Hualian sent out Da Li Xuechong, Xiao Kong, and the black Bort, while the American military police had many unfamiliar faces, but it is said that they were the most elite main force. After contact, Bort opened the scoring, Xuechong made a free throw, and Xiao Kong and Xuechong made a series of layups. The American military police only scored one goal by Brown when the score was 3-0, and in an instant it became 10-2, with Hualian leading the way, making the American military police gasp. Luo Bo made a shot, and Xuechong returned the favor, making it 12-4. The American soldiers called a timeout, and Wood scored again, ending the first quarter with a score of 14-6.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, the American soldiers (slightly more active, after Cheng Zhang made a layup, Cardanini successively scored, turning the tide and being chased to 12-15. Fortunately, Hualian dealt with it carefully, and Bort, Xuechong, and Cheng Zhang scored every time, with both sides rising and falling, and the scores were quite even. At the end of the first half, although the American soldiers scored one more goal than Hualian, Hualian had sufficient capital and still led by seven points with a score of 27-20.</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, Da Li and Xiao Kong retired, and the American soldiers took advantage of Hualian's loose formation and caught up section by section, at one point forcing a tie at 29 points each, and then forming a seesaw battle situation. At the end of the third quarter, Hualian still led with a score of 39-35. Li Zhenzhong was the soul of Hualian, although he did not make any achievements, but once he retired, Hualian's offensive weakened.</p>
<p>In the final quarter, Da Li still took the stage, and the military might of Hualian was revived, the twilight atmosphere disappeared, and Xuechong Liangxiong became more active, with the entire quarter being dominated by the two of them, with Chen and Zhang each accounting for half of the twelve points scored. The American soldiers were also only supported by Brown, and their fighting spirit was already depleted. When the whistle sounded, Hualian won with a score of 51-46.</p>
<p>The results of the three matches are recorded below:</p>
<p>Green Forest - Overseas Chinese (A group) 34 - 21</p>
<p>Desheng - V Team (A group) 34 - 27</p>
<p>Hua Zhou - American Military Police (Friendship) 51 - 46</p>

<h3>The Founding of the Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association</h3>
<p>— You Mijian</p>
<p>Taiwan was ruled by Japan for fifty-one years, which means that the compatriots in Taiwan were slaves of Japan for fifty-one years. All the economic resources and wealth were exploited, and the people of Taiwan could only survive as slaves. All the culture, thoughts, and speech were suppressed like bean sprouts in the dark, with no sunlight to be seen and no room for growth. Under the high pressure of imperialism, fascist germs were cultivated day by day. Therefore, the people of Taiwan were severely anesthetized by the fascist toxins during these fifty-one years, and the roots of imperialism spread quite deeply in Taiwanese society.</p>
<p>Now that Taiwan has been restored, everyone has returned to the embrace of the motherland, and at the same time, everyone hopes to quickly build a new Taiwan of the Three Principles of the People and become good people under the Three Principles of the People. However, toxins cannot be eliminated overnight, and toxic roots cannot be dug up cleanly in a day. In order to quickly realize the ideals of the Three Principles of the People, how should we eliminate these toxins and dig up these toxic roots? How can we change our enslaved concepts? How can we assist the government in building a new Taiwan? This is what we should consider and work hard on. The motivation for the establishment of the Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association comes from this. The purpose of the Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association is to promote the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, instill the ideas of democratic politics, change the enslaved Taiwanese culture, assist the government in implementing policies and decrees, teach the national language and literature, and provide various services to society. However, this important work cannot be done by a few people. It requires everyone's collective wisdom and efforts to unite and do it together. That is why we are initiating this Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association, hoping that everyone will join this group, unite sincerely, and work together to promote what the people of new Taiwan should do for new Taiwan. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Discovers Atomic Energy, Claiming to Have Achieved Preliminary Success</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Yesterday's diary published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party stated that the Soviet Union is close to discovering atomic energy. The diary contained an article on atomic energy by Professor Simon Ke Qingke, which stated that the most important theoretical and practical work facing science in the new era is the creation of the chemistry of the atomic nucleus, which is as thorough as the chemistry of the atom itself. The effect of solving this kind of work can enable us to transform a large amount or kind of elements into other kinds of elements, but the more important work is to use the huge amount of "energy" created in this kind of transformation. The first successful step recently achieved in this regard has made us anticipate that the period of controlling the energy contained in the atomic nucleus is not far away. Discoveries in this field cannot always be exclusively owned by one country or another. The professor also quoted the recent statement by Foreign Minister Molotov: "We will have atomic energy and other things."</p>

<h3>Cheng Zhonghang Sends Personnel to Investigate, Numerous Problems in Various Warehouses, Even Omission of Warehouse Names in Remote Areas, Reluctant to Hand Over Even After Forced Unsealing</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter visited Cheng Zhonghang, Inspector of Jiangsu, yesterday to inquire about the recent work of the Inspector's Office. Inspector Cheng comprehensively replied as follows.</p>
<p>Warehouse Inventory Reveals Missing Inventory Lists</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the thorough investigation of the takeover matters in various aspects, personnel are being sent to the relevant agencies and nearby areas for visits and investigations. The current stage of takeover involves the warehouses initially taken over by various military and government agencies, which are ordered to be handed over to the Customs for inventory. The Customs has a total of 500 units of warehouses and wharfs to be inventoried this time. Among them, 100 units were taken over and handed over by the original mountains and navy. In the past half month, the Customs authorities mobilized all customs officers and staff to participate in the work. According to the investigation, the difficulties in the inventory are: First, the agencies handing over the warehouses often do not attach the original inventory lists handed over by the enemy. There are also warehouses in remote areas where even the names of the warehouses are not listed, such as the two warehouses that were recently burned. There are also some warehouses where the original receiving personnel refuse to hand over for some reason, and there are also some warehouses where a certain part of the warehouse is not allowed to be handed over for inventory for some reason. After being forced to unseal, there are various excuses for delaying the handover. There are also cases where a large number of trucks suddenly arrive at a nearby warehouse while receiving a certain warehouse, fully loaded with goods and leaving. This kind of situation directly disregards government laws and regulations and indirectly hinders prices and people's livelihood. The office has successively reported to the central authorities.</p>
<p>Military Police in Jiangsu Province Forcibly Impose Donations</p>
<p>(2) According to the investigation of the office in the recovered areas of Jiangsu Province, the local military police repeatedly impose donations on merchants and farmers. Taking Shanghai as an example, the office has repeatedly received complaints from merchants about police stations forcing the purchase of rice at low prices and forcing the purchase of goods in shops, and the detention of merchants at every turn, feeling deeply distressed. Personnel have been sent to secretly investigate. The office will use swift and effective methods to punish unscrupulous police officers in the city according to law, to vent the people's anger and relieve the merchants' plight. (3) The office has recently received a number of signed complaints, and the submissions contain detailed guarantees of the shops and the facts alleged. However, when the office sends personnel to thoroughly investigate and summons the complainants and guarantors, they often hide and fail to appear. This situation is due to the merchants' fear of the accumulated power of the official offices, or there may be other concerns, but it is deeply hoped that the people will have a responsible attitude for their own rights at this time and fight against the evil forces.</p>
<h3>Three Batches of Affordable Fabrics to Be Sold Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has decided that the third batch of affordable fabrics will be available for sale starting (the 30th). In addition to the original five major companies – Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, and China National Goods Company – for the sake of widespread supply, two more stores, Da Hu and Shanghai, will be added in the French Concession; two stores, You Xin and Xinda Xiang, will be added; and one store, Xie Da Xiang, will be added in the Nanshi area, making a total of ten locations distributed throughout the city. As for the types and prices of fabrics, Khaki Drill is priced at 900 yuan per yard; White Twill at 450 yuan per yard; White Flannel at 600 yuan per yard; White Poplin at 600 yuan per yard; Black Serge at 800 yuan per yard; and White Cambric at 450 yuan per yard. Some of the prices are lower than the previous batch.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Renting Land Must Register with the Land Bureau</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Administration Bureau, based on central government laws and regulations, has formulated registration methods for land with Perpetual Leases or Deed Leases and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. According to the regulations, foreigners renting land with Perpetual Leases or Deed Leases should directly apply to the Municipal Land Administration Bureau for registration of perpetual lease rights. If the Perpetual Lease or Deed Lease belongs to a Chinese national, an application for ownership registration should be made. As for foreign merchants who registered in the past, they have no right to register transfers or issue ownership documents according to law. Recently, various newspapers have published announcements by 14 foreign companies, including the British firm Arnhold &amp; Co., Ltd., to re-register property rights, which is inappropriate. The competent authorities are seeking appropriate measures to deal with this and hope that citizens will cherish national sovereignty and proceed to register with the Municipal Land Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3>New Street Names for the City to Take Effect on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that many of the old and current names of certain roads in the city are inappropriate and need to be changed. In addition to Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and Great West Road, which were renamed Zhongzheng Road on October 30, it has now been decided that: (1) The Bund (currently Huangpu Tan Road) will be renamed Zhongshan Road; (2) Avenue Joffre (currently "Taishan Road") will be renamed Linsen Road; (3) Avenue Lafayette (currently "Daxing Road") will be renamed Fuxing Road; (4) Route Tenant de la Tour (currently "Changxing Road"), Route Frelupt (currently "Nanhai Road"), and Route Hulin (currently "Xichangxing Road") will be merged and renamed Jianguo Road; (5) Bubbling Well Road will be renamed Nanjing West Road; (6) Route Louvain (currently "Anhui Road") and Route Mercier (currently "Ningxia Road") will be renamed Xizang South Road; (7) Avenue Haig (currently "Datong Road") will be renamed Beijing West Road. The names of the above roads will all be changed starting on December 1.</p>
<h3>Ship Allocation Committee to Handle National Shipping</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Mr. Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who had just returned to Shanghai from Chongqing, and inquired about specific plans for developing shipping. He replied that the National Ship Allocation Committee will be established in Chongqing on the first of next month. The committee has been ordered by Premier Song to allocate all ships. The committee will also divide the area into two management regions. Ships above Hankou will be the responsibility of the Chongqing Ship Allocation Committee, headed by two deputy directors, Lu and Qi. Shipping below Hankou and along the coast will be managed by the Shanghai Ship Allocation Committee, handled by Liu Shengren, Hong Sheng, and himself.</p>
<h3>Cultural Gathering Held Yesterday: Zhang Daofan Reports on the General Situation of Culture in the Wartime Capital over Eight Years; Xu Xiaoyan Says the Legislative Yuan Is Revising the Publications Law</h3>
<p>Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, and Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Information, jointly held a tea party for the cultural circles of the city at Kang Le Restaurant at 2:30 PM yesterday, attended by more than 500 people from the cultural, news, film, and theater fields.</p>
<p>General Progress in All Culture</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, Zhang Daofan delivered a speech reporting on the development of education, news, publishing, literature and art, music, fine arts, theater, film, and acrobatics in the wartime capital over the past eight years. He stated briefly that (1) education has made progress in both quantity and quality; (2) the news media has made great contributions to the leadership of public opinion and the development of national spirit; (3) publishing, despite insufficient paper and printing conditions, has progressed in both quantity and quality; (4) literature and art have seen new integration and new efforts during the nation-building period. In addition, music, fine arts, theater, film, and acrobatics have all raised the status of folk art.</p>
<p>Xu Reports on Freedom of the Press</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Xu then delivered a speech, stating briefly that he had one addition to Mr. Zhang Daofan's report, which could also be said to be good news for people in the cultural field. That is, the central government is preparing to revise the Publications Law. The detailed rules for the Publications Law currently in use were drafted before the War of Resistance, and supplementary regulations were added later to meet the needs of wartime. Now that the war has ended, the wartime supplementary regulations are no longer needed. Based on the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of publication, all the provisions of the current Publications Law will be re-repealed or revised. In the past, the scope of restrictions was broader; in the future, it will probably only restrict the publication of text that harms good morals or endangers public order. As for publication registration, it was restricted during the war to maintain military and diplomatic secrets and due to printing materials and paper issues, but in the future, it will only be a formality. This revised new Publications Law has been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council and is now being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. Once promulgated, the future of China's cultural circles will be brighter and more developed.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Mr. Zhang Daofan will go to Japan next month to investigate Japanese culture.</p>

<h3>"Rickshaw Queen" to Be Chosen This Saturday: General Wedemeyer Plans to Attend in Person</h3>
<p>The lively and active spirit of Americans has always been unmatched by people from any other country. When they first came to Shanghai and saw countless rickshaws and pedicabs on the streets, squeezing back and forth, they undoubtedly felt a great deal of interest. After being away from home for a long time, American children probably hoped to relive some of the lively American fun after coming to Shanghai. But in fact, they were disappointed. Today's Shanghai is not the Shanghai they imagined. The Jai Alai stadium has long been closed, and the horses and dogs in the racecourse and dog track have either starved to death or been eaten as beef and mutton, or have been sold off. However, their need for excitement and liveliness has not diminished; indeed, they have come up with a new game. They are going to hold a "Rickshaw Race," initiated by the China Special Edition of the *Stars and Stripes* newspaper. The reporter went to visit the newspaper and obtained detailed information.</p>
<p>This Saturday (December 1st) afternoon, the US Army and Navy will hold a football game at the dog track on Albert Road. Before the football game, a Shanghai "Rickshaw Queen" will be selected. There are a total of twenty rickshaws participating in the race. Each rickshaw will have a lady sitting on it, pulled by a rickshaw puller. Starting at 1:00 PM, they will start from the Bund, pass through Nanjing Road, Bubbling Well Road, and Seymour Road, and turn west to the dog track on Albert Road. The first rickshaw to reach the finish line will win first prize.</p>
<p>Among the ladies participating in the race, there are four Chinese, one American, one Canadian, and the rest are Russian. Each lady represents her organization or a high-ranking official such as Generals Wedemeyer and Stratemeyer. Four of the twenty rickshaws were hired on the street, and the rest are private cars. The US military has specially assigned people to step up training at the racecourse, which has taken a full ten days. Each rickshaw will be decorated in a dazzling manner. The 10th Air Force has also specially made a lightweight aluminum car to participate in the race.</p>
<p>The race route is three miles long and will take about twenty minutes. Generals Wedemeyer and Stratemeyer will both be present to preside over the ceremony.</p>
<p>It is reported that the *Stars and Stripes* will use 7 million yuan in puppet currency as prizes, with the first prize being 2 million yuan in puppet currency, and the rest will be distributed in several levels. In addition, other items will be given to each contestant.</p>
<p>As for the road traffic order during the race, it will be maintained by military police specially assigned by the US military.</p>
<p>This unprecedented and special fresh race is bound to give the people of Shanghai another interesting topic of conversation.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn in Short Supply, Gold Market Calm</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, because the sales from Hunan and Hubei are quite good. In the case of 20-count yarn, the spot goods have risen by another 20,000 due to short supply. 32-count fine yarn and 42-count double yarn are especially sought after by merchants from other places, with a crazy rise of 100,000. 16-count and below are still not popular, and the price is similar to the previous day. Yesterday, the Jiangshun ship exported 700 pieces of cotton yarn and 500 pieces of piece goods to Hankou.</p>
<p>Gold Price</p>
<p>Yesterday (28th), the market fluctuated. Due to various speculations in recent days, the price rose and fell sharply, resulting in heavy losses for both sides. The bulls were slaughtered first, and the short sellers covered their positions later. It was not until yesterday that the storm passed and the market calmed down. There were repeated struggles at the 800,000 mark, resulting in a drop of more than 20,000. However, after the midday close, the downward trend continued, once retreating to 770,000. The gold price in Tianjin fell to within 60,000 due to a sudden tightening of credit. There were also reports of tight credit in Chongqing. In the future, more goods will arrive from various places, making it difficult to expect any action in the trend. The price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores also dropped slightly from 86,000 to 84,000. Because the price of silver in jewelry stores was still 650, the price of silver dollars was still between 444 and 445 yuan yesterday. The black market discount was higher, about 15% to 18%.</p>
<p>US Dollar</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was slightly soft. The gold price was sluggish, and the Tianjin market plummeted, so it gradually dropped from 1360 yuan to around 1330 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. As for the Hong Kong dollar, because the prices in Hong Kong and Macau were higher, the overall situation was still stable (the old goods there were worth 400 yuan, and the new goods were worth a quarter of a US dollar, 5 yuan and zero). As a result, the old goods fell by 5 yuan, and the new goods fell by 2 yuan. The price of a Hong Kong gold pound was 3,000 and something, and the price of a rupee was around 300.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Yesterday, insiders continued to push up the price. C-type was close to the 500 yuan mark, and then they rushed to sell, and in an instant, the price plummeted, breaking into 400 yuan. However, many outsiders bought in at the low, and finally stabilized at around 403 yuan. As a result, the prices of various bonds were slightly higher than the previous closing price. A-type and B-type fell by 20 yuan due to a weaker speculative atmosphere. The change may not be far away, because people in the industry have taken profits and transferred funds to small Chinese stocks, and various speculations are too far from the facts.</p>
<p>Stock</p>
<p>At first, it was extremely calm. After the large bond market investors took profits, the funds were transferred to various small stocks. Before the close, a sudden surge occurred due to the exhaustion of buying orders. However, the speculative atmosphere was too strong, and the authorities continued to warn to guard against unexpected blows. The situation in the foreign stock market was calm, with little difference from the previous day.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice market, because the prices in the interior were still firm, formed a production and sales reversal, and the transportation was not smooth. The owners were very firm, and the price was slightly up by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil price rebounded slightly by 400 to 500 yuan. The price of soybeans also rose slightly by 200 to 300 yuan. The retail sales of flour were still acceptable, and the market was firm. Soybean cake, cottonseed cake, and bran were all stable.</p>
<p>The coal market continued to show a weak trend. Only the sound of buyers and sellers asking prices was heard in the market, and there were few actual transactions. Although the price reduction wind was very severe, sellers also devalued and sold their goods. Anthracite arrived one after another. Because the market has been flat for several days, the industry is watching with a wait-and-see attitude, and the price is trending downward.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabric</p>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction volume of woolen fabrics was limited, especially the transaction volume of all-wool high-grade goods was even smaller. The existing stock was extremely scarce, and the asking price was too high, so the market transactions were mostly for second-rate goods made of local factory goods, rayon cotton, and coarse wool yarn. At the same time, due to the impact of current events, most hoarders stopped passing the buck to each other, which is also one of the reasons for reducing the import and export volume.</p>
<h3>Huangtai Oranges Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of the war, fruits from Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong, such as oranges, bananas, and sugar cane, have disappeared from the city. However, Huangtai oranges from eastern Zhejiang can still arrive in Shanghai. The Maoli ship arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou the day before yesterday, carrying 2,797 boxes of Huangtai oranges, which are the only fruits monopolized in the market. Now that Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangdong have been recovered, the above-mentioned fruits from various places should be able to be transported here this winter.</p>
<h3>Nuomi Zhi Litchi Soon to Be Launched</h3>
<p>Nuomi Zhi litchi is the best quality among litchis. Due to the long-term obstruction of transportation, the source is scarce, and the cold storage goods in the market have also been out of stock for a long time. It is now heard that the new goods of this year have been shipped from Hong Kong and will arrive in Shanghai soon. There are more Yuan Zhi and Bian Zhi. At a time when prices seem to be trending downward, new goods are appearing on the market again, which will definitely help to suppress and stabilize prices. It has been found that the market has already seen loose noodle production. For example, Longan has fallen by 20% before and after, and there was a continuous arrival of new large bubble Longan from Quanzhou yesterday, and the asking price may be loose.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "Reorganization of Book Capital Amount" was suspended due to manuscript congestion.</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee Member Sun Jiulu Talks About the Main Points of the New Company Law</h3>
<p>Simplified Procedures for Company Organization; Foreign Companies Adopt Territoriality</p>
<p>According to a special report from this newspaper, the new Company Law will be promulgated on January 1 next year, but it has not yet been made public. There are different rumors in the city's business community. Yesterday, the reporter of this newspaper specially visited Mr. Sun Jiulu, a legislator in charge of drafting the law, and inquired about the main points of the new law. According to Mr. Sun, the new Company Law is based on the first phase of the economic implementation plan of the Supreme National Defense Council. In legal principle, it tends toward economic liberalism and encourages the public to use their own financial and human resources to establish industries that China urgently needs. Therefore, the new Company Law has</p>
<p>Two Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) In law, the people and the government have equal status; (2) The procedures and procedures for company organization are simpler than before. In the past, in order to suit the wartime situation, my country had a special limited liability company organization, so that the central government could jointly run industrial and commercial enterprises with the people or provincial and municipal institutions or foreign merchants. The new Company Law has no provisions for special companies. In the future, the government and the people will work together to promote the national industry.</p>
<p>Simplified Organization</p>
<p>Mr. Sun also said that the most significant improvement in the new Company Law is the provision that the organization and management of joint-stock limited companies can adopt the methods of unlimited companies. In other words, although limited liability companies have limited liability in terms of capital, they can freely adopt limited or unlimited company methods in terms of organization and management according to the needs of the environment. This is the first point of simplification of company organization. Secondly, the old Company Law restricted equity measures in order to avoid manipulation by large shareholders. The new law does not have this restriction, and the principle of one share, one vote is adopted. Therefore, the rights and interests of large shareholders can be more fully protected. Although the new Company Law does not have explicit provisions on restricting equity, each company can stipulate restrictions in its own articles of association. The principle of the new Company Law is to facilitate the organization of private institutions and to correct them on the right track with strict penalties.</p>
<p>Foreign Companies</p>
<p>The reporter raised the organizational procedures for foreign companies and asked Sun Min to answer. Mr. Sun said that the concept of the new Company Law regarding foreign investment is to enable Chinese and foreign capital to obtain equal status and equal protection, and hopes that Chinese and foreign capital can stand on the same footing to promote China's industry. The new Company Law adopts the principle of "territoriality" for so-called "foreign companies", that is, a company must have two conditions to obtain the status of "foreign company": (1) It must have a head office in a foreign country; (2) It must have actual and regular business operations in a foreign country. Other foreign companies must be organized in accordance with the new Company Law. There is no restriction on the proportion of funds for Sino-foreign joint ventures, but the position of chairman of the board must be held by a person of Chinese nationality. Mr. Sun added that we adopt the principle of international reciprocity for foreign investment.</p>
<p>The new Company Law was drafted by Sun and legislators Sheng Zhenwei and Zhang Zhaoyuan in April this year, passed its third reading by the Legislative Yuan in October this year, and is scheduled to be implemented on January 1 next year. Because Shanghai is the national industrial and commercial hub, Mr. Sun came here to investigate the current situation of various companies for reference.</p>

<h3>Large Land and Abundant Resources</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Anyone who enters school will mostly have an impression that China is "large in land and abundant in resources."</p>
<p>China's "large land" is beyond doubt. China was able to win the final victory in the eight-year War of Resistance, and "large land" was indeed one of the important reasons. If China were a small country like Denmark or Norway, China would have been subjugated many times. Now that China has resisted Japan for eight years and can still have a complete government and occupy a portion of free land, it is not without the gift of "large land."</p>
<p>As for the words "abundant resources," they often give the people of our country a wrong illusion that China has many resources and is rich in materials. In fact, you only need to take a trip to the interior and see the situation in China's rural areas. It is really poor and miserable, and the types of materials are not many and the quantity is not large. China is actually very poor, so how can we talk about "abundant resources"?</p>
<p>Many of China's resources are buried underground, and many lands are barren. Without the ability to utilize them, they are almost equivalent to waste. For China to be rich and strong, it depends on industrialization and mechanization, and even more on hard work!</p>
<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>France After Liberation</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The author of this article, Weydenbacker, is the European bureau chief of the American magazines *Time* and *Life*. From the following correspondence, we can see the difficult conditions in France after liberation, as well as the celebrations in Paris when full peace arrived.</p>
<p>——Translator's Note</p>
<p>Our car passed the Chamber of Deputies, where we saw that the building was burning. A large hotel wall was riddled with bullet holes, and a large pillar had been blown down. Gunshots could be heard occasionally on the street. By the time we arrived at the hostel, the moon had risen.</p>
<p>That day was Friday evening, August 25, 1944, the day the German troops were driven out of Paris by the French and the American troops entered. The next day, De Gaulle led his tattered army of victory in a parade on the streets for the first time. And so, Paris awoke from its confusion and prepared to spend its first free (but also most difficult) winter in five years.</p>
<p>During the occupation, although they suffered humiliation and pain, life was quite exciting. On the one hand, pro-German factions made a fortune and enjoyed the black market life. On the other hand, the underground resistance also tasted the pleasure of adventure. With the realization of liberation, the first group hoped that the Americans would intercede for them, while the second group believed that after the victory of the new French resistance, the country could be revived. But as a result, from the liberation of France until the end of the European war, for nine months, neither of these hopes was realized.</p>
<p>Life in the first winter after the liberation of France was extremely miserable. The situation was still relatively good in late summer and early autumn. Because the weather was still warm, although food was scarce, it was not as lacking as it would later become. After the electricity supply stopped, people had to walk up and down the stairs in buildings, and there were no lights to turn on at night. Buses and business cars were suspended. Only bicycles or overcrowded trams were available, or people simply walked. Except for those who could afford black market prices, other citizens waited in lines for a long time, and the things they bought were still not enough. Workers regarded small amounts of cigarettes and alcohol as treasures. Even those who could afford black market cigarettes carefully hid their cigarette butts.</p>
<p>Winter arrived especially early, and the suffering increased accordingly. Food became even scarcer, and the city's coal reserves were almost non-existent. Everyone wore everything they had, but still shivered with cold in their houses. Women had no socks to wear and developed frostbite on their legs when they went to work. Musicians wore gloves with the fingertips cut off to play. Dancers had to drink wine before they could take off their clothes. Many sophisticated gentlemen did not take a bath for five months in a row. From October onwards, the whole of Paris suffered from colds, and everyone coughed until mid-May. Some poor people developed lung diseases, and some even died.</p>
<p>Fortunately, spring arrived early. In the Luxembourg Gardens, children raised their pale faces to the sun, and women sat on benches allowing the warmth to soothe their chapped legs. The French are naturally carefree, at least on the surface. The tables in the cafes were moved outside. Nightclubs stayed open late into the night, and the military did not interfere. The book stalls on the docks gradually increased, selling old books, old maps, and colorful scraps of paper.</p>
<p>In December, when the German army launched a counter-offensive in the Ardennes, the people of Paris remembered that the German army had said in August, when they withdrew, that they would come to Paris for Christmas, and they were all worried. After the Allied forces crossed the Rhine, everyone knew that the end of the war was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>But happiness also brought sorrow. From the returning prisoners of war and exiles, they heard about the deaths of many acquaintances. Many of those who returned were sick or so old that they could not be recognized. There was a story that was humorous in its sadness. The wife of a prisoner of war knew that her husband was coming home, so she specially prepared a double portion of food, a double bed, and even went out to borrow things from the neighbors. Just as she left, her husband came in and, seeing the situation, misunderstood and turned away without looking back.</p>
<p>As the war drew to a close, France and Paris were exhausted. At that time, everything was waiting to be done, but there was a lack of people to handle it. After Pétain returned, he lived a comfortable prison life. Former prime ministers such as Herriot, Reynaud, and Daladier also returned and, after looking at the political situation, quietly sat down to write their autobiographies.</p>
<p>On the day the war officially ended, after the final air raid alert was lifted at 3:00 p.m., the people began to celebrate with some restraint. Several cars and jeeps filled with soldiers and young people drove past, cheering and singing softly. Older people looked at each other and said, "Now that the war is over, everything should be different, shouldn't it?"</p>
<p>The only emotion the people expressed on the night of the victory was hope. We walked all over the city that night, and everything we saw was like that. The lights were very bright, and people were looking at the lights. Near the Grand Theater, a large group of people were walking in the strange electric light. Several young men and women were even dancing. People at the entrance of the theater were sitting on the steps, not watching the dancing, not looking at each other, but looking at the lights.</p>
<p>On the way back, we passed the Place de la Concorde. I remembered that nine months ago, that was the place where people celebrated the German retreat with wild enthusiasm. We crossed the quiet bridge and stopped at the Chamber of Deputies across from the dock. On the wall was a small wooden plaque. It was adorned with a sprig of lilac, and the plaque was engraved with "Here fell Clute Bilin, August 25, 1944, aged twenty-one."</p>

<h3>Celebrities' Hats</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>During World War II, the hats worn by many celebrities were as brilliant and outstanding as their names. The eight hats recorded here are the "trademarks" of well-known figures familiar to readers.</p>
<p>A simple gray felt hat with a narrow band, tied around with a string, became known to the world when Truman became President of the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill's tall black hat, which he has used for many years, is as inseparable from him as his cigar box and is familiar to people all over the world.</p>
<p>General Montgomery always wore that special French-style soft hat. Wherever this hat passed, a glorious and great military achievement was shown. Now this soft hat is as famous as his vegetarianism.</p>
<p>Although lost and found several times, and damaged by artillery fire and bullets, General Stilwell still cherished this outstanding broken hat and continued to wear it, even more noticeable than his glasses.</p>
<p>In the United States, when New York Mayor La Guardia appeared in social settings, his pointed black hat was often used as a joke. This good-tempered mayor cherished this hat very much.</p>
<p>Before winning his fourth Silver Star, the round steel helmet worn by General Patton, along with his sharpshooting skills, had already become a famous anecdote on the European battlefield.</p>
<p>A military leader can choose any style of hat. A few years ago, General MacArthur selected the one he currently uses, which is the most famous style in the U.S. Army, and is probably already familiar to readers.</p>
<p>Admiral Mitscher, leading the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, has inflicted countless defeats on the Japanese Navy. He often wore a baseball-style hat to direct operations.</p>

<h3>New Rat Poison</h3>
<p>— Wang Yanxiang</p>
<p>"Antu" is the name of a rat poison, specifically used to kill rats, and is very toxic. One pound can kill 300,000 rats. It was invented by Dr. Leitchert, a psychopathologist at a hospital in Baltimore, USA. Because it was kept secret during the war, it was only recently published.</p>
<p>"Antu" is formed by spelling out the initial letters of the chemical name. Its invention was also a coincidence. It was accidentally discovered during a taste test in a psychological laboratory. It is a grayish-white fine powder with a slight odor, and its toxicity is 100 times greater than arsenic. But it has two major characteristics: (1) It only poisons rats and is harmless to humans. (2) It causes pulmonary edema in rats, which kills them.</p>
<p>The method of use is also very simple. Just mix this powder with grain flour, put it on fruits, vegetables, cut apples, sweet potatoes, floorboards, runways, drinks that rats like to drink, or near their burrows, and you can avoid rat harassment. If it is used systematically, even the most severe plague can be eliminated within one or two days.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, although it has been tested repeatedly, the 500,000 residents have not been affected at all. Dogs may be poisoned, but dogs have a vomiting reaction to this drug, so they are less affected. Rabbits are also unaffected, and chickens can eat a spoonful without harm.</p>
<p>Although an antidote has not yet been invented, Dr. Leitchert advocates using gastric lavage. Victims should not be given liquids, only oxygen should be supplied.</p>
<p>Because this drug is helpful for the war, it is regarded as an important military supply. During the war, diseases such as typhus and plague were extremely rampant, and this drug could be used to eliminate them.</p>
<h3>New Scientific Information</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>How people with deep nicotine addiction react to smoke has not been very clear. Recently, medical scientists, after many experiments, have found that when addicted people see smoke, their blood pressure increases, their pulse quickens, the humidity of the skin on their hands and feet decreases, and the speed of their heartbeat also changes.</p>
<p>Soviet scientists have successfully transplanted frog hearts. After the frog used the new heart, it continued to live for as long as four months.</p>
<p>Medicine</p>
<h3>Plant Diseases</h3>
<p>— Yu An</p>
<p>Only the plant itself can tell in detail what nutrients are lacking in the soil. Chemistry can analyze the soil and know the elements it contains, but it cannot know exactly how much of each element is useful to the plant.</p>
<p>Scientists have conducted 20 years of research on the tobacco industry. From careful observation of the symptoms shown by the roots, stems, and leaves of this plant, they have found answers to the lack of nine important plant nutrients.</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves are the best experimental product, because the leaf surface exposed to light is very large. The symptoms of tobacco leaves lacking potassium are similar to those of cotton suffering from potassium deficiency. Other plants cannot show the symptoms of plant diseases so easily. Only from the subtle symptoms of tobacco leaves can the nutritional deficiency diseases of other plants be answered.</p>
<p>The nine important plant nutrients mentioned above are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, boron, sulfur, manganese, and iron. According to Dr. McMurtrey, when a plant lacks an element, it not only does not grow, but also has a special change. When a plant lacks nitrogen, it turns a light green color, the lower leaves turn yellow, and when dry, it becomes a light brown color. When it lacks phosphorus, the plant turns dark green, the width and length of the leaves are narrower than usual, and the plant also does not grow.</p>
<p>Lack of potassium and magnesium has the same effect as lack of nitrogen and phosphorus, affecting the lower leaves (old leaves), or even the entire plant. Lack of calcium, boron, zinc, sulfur, and iron, in the beginning, affects the tender leaves on the upper part of the plant. For example, when iron is lacking, it can be seen that the tender leaves are less green, becoming a chlorosis, and the green of the main veins is darker than the green of the leaf blades. After the veins lose their color, the leaf blades become white or yellow.</p>
<p>As a result of research, scientists have discovered that from the sowing of plants to maturity, the same is true at any time. The size and age of the plant itself are irrelevant to this symptom of "nutritional deficiency."</p>
<p>Dr. McMurtrey said: Once the problem of plant nutritional deficiency is solved, all plants will become healthier and increase their ability to resist plant diseases and pests.</p>
<p>Dr. McMurtrey added: If a tobacco grower can be completely familiar with these symptoms, then he can correctly diagnose the source of nutritional deficiencies in plants in the field, because he already knows the plant's life history, living habits, the effects of plant diseases and pests on plants, and so on.

<h3>How Old Is the Earth?</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>There are about forty different estimates of the age of the Earth, ranging from 100 million years to 3 billion years. Geologists and physicists advocate for long-term estimates, because geologists must explain strata that are clearly more than 100 million years old, while physicists know that it takes at least 4.6 billion years for potassium in ancient rocks to turn into lead. They once agreed that the age of the Earth should be at least 2 billion years or 3 billion years. Although the difference between the two is quite large, it is not arbitrary speculation. Potassium is an accurate clock, and it decays at a certain rate regardless of the rocks that contain it. As a result, it turns into lead in a predetermined period.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, uranium is not a clock, but eight clocks starting at the same time, because there are eight types of uranium on Earth (what physicists call "isotopes"), which turn into sixteen types of lead at different rates. Fortunately, these sixteen types of lead can be traced back to their mother uranium. Only one of the eight clocks shows the correct time, and according to it, the age of the Earth is about 2 billion years.</p>
<p>The report submitted by Dr. Wilkin and Dr. Leighton to the American Association for the Advancement of Science is not much different from this estimate. Using one of the eight isotopes of potassium, copper uranium (the uranium that eventually turns into lead) as a clock, they obtained a new and more accurate estimate of 2.5 billion years. A difference of 500 million years seems very large to us, but if we include the long period of time that the Earth was attracted from the sun by a certain planet, it cannot be considered too long. Astrophysicists will definitely thank Wilkin and Leighton for finally solving this riddle. In today's high-pitched theory of cosmic expansion, the age of planets and the Earth is extremely important to them. Because unless they know the age of the Earth and the Sun correctly, they can never suppress the relativists who insist that the Earth is younger than the planets.</p>

<h3>Fishing Rod on a Jeep</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zuo</p>
<p>Many Shanghai people find it strange why some jeeps with American military police have something that looks like a fishing rod erected on them. In fact, this is the antenna of a wireless portable telephone, relying on it, the military police can receive orders anytime and anywhere, and quickly complete their tasks.</p>
<p>For example, in post-war Europe: "Military police, pay attention!" The wireless radio in a jeep is calling: "Six German prisoners of war carrying weapons have escaped and privately stolen a truck. They are now heading towards the Paris Avenue." After receiving the news, the American military police stationed in Paris immediately dispatched. ... Now they are tracking the escaped German prisoners. They shout for them to stop, and there is already a military police vehicle in front to block the way for the German prisoners. The machine gun rattles. These prisoners have no choice but to raise their hands and run out of hiding, and their mission ends.</p>
<h3>Dry Cleaning Soap</h3>
<p>— Chong Mei</p>
<p>Waterless dry cleaning soap has recently been invented in the United States. It is shaped like cream. When using it, there is no need to apply water. Pour some on the palm and gently rub it on the skin, and the dirt will fall off with it. After use, a layer of dirt-resistant film is added to the skin.</p>

<h3>The Enemy (8)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck</p>
<p>He thought, "Let her vomit out what's in her stomach." He forgot that she had never seen an operation before. But her pain and his own inability to go and see her made him impatient and irritable with this person who was as dead as he was lying under his knife.</p>
<p>He thought, "There is no reason in the world to keep this person alive."</p>
<p>This thought made him unconsciously cruel and acted quickly. The man groaned in his sleep, but Sadao paid no attention to him, only muttering:</p>
<p>"Shout, shout if you want to. I'm not operating on you because I want to. To be honest, I don't even know why."</p>
<p>The door opened and Hana came in. She didn't stop at all, and didn't even touch her disheveled hair.</p>
<p>She asked in a clear voice: "Where is the anesthetic?"</p>
<p>Sadao moved his chin and said, "You're back just in time, this guy is starting to move." She held the anesthetic and a bit of cotton in her hand.</p>
<p>She asked, "How do I do it?"</p>
<p>Sadao replied, "Just soak the cotton with anesthetic and move it close to his nostrils. If his breathing becomes rapid, move the cotton away a little." He said this without stopping the complicated operation he was doing.</p>
<p>She squatted beside the sleeping face of the young American. She thought, this is a pitifully thin face, with twisted lips. Whether this person knows it himself or not, he is always suffering. Looking at him, she began to have some doubts, wondering if the stories she sometimes heard about the suffering of prisoners were true. When reading the newspaper, it only recorded how the people cheered for liberation wherever the Japanese army went. But sometimes she remembered people like General Takima, who was so cruel to his wife at home, that no one mentioned it again after he won a battle in Manchuria. If a person like him can treat a woman under his power so cruelly, wouldn't he be cruel to people like this white man?</p>
<p>She earnestly hoped that this young man had not been abused. At this moment, she saw deep red scars on his neck, just below his ears. She raised her eyes and looked at Sadao, and said softly, "These scars."</p>
<p>But he did not answer. At this time, he felt the end of his instrument hit something hard, and there was a risk of hitting the kidneys. All thoughts left him. All he felt was pure joy. He gently explored with his fingers, familiar with every cell in this person's body. The old American professor who taught him anatomy attached the most importance to this matter. "Gentlemen, the lack of knowledge of the human body is the greatest sin of a surgeon!" he shouted year after year in class. "When performing surgery, if you are not as familiar with the body as if you had created it yourself, it is murder."</p>
<p>Sadao said softly, "Not yet touching the kidneys, my friend." When he forgot himself while performing surgery, he had this habit of whispering to the patient. He often called his patients "my friend," so now he did so, forgetting that this was his enemy.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Solving the Transportation Problems for the Maritime Workforce</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Saving Precious Time, Enhancing Work Efficiency</p>
<p>"Punctuality" is one of the virtues of the public, yet it is regrettable that the general public often fails to observe it! For example, if a meeting is scheduled for nine o'clock, it is often the case that everyone is not present until half-past ten. One is forced to extend the meeting time, with the majority waiting for the minority. As a result, holding a meeting takes half a day, which is not economical with time; this is a common sight. Some people do not understand and always say that failing to be punctual is a waste of other people's precious time and is also an immoral act. In fact, this should also be excused; those who break appointments do not necessarily want to do so. The problem lies in the inadequacy of transportation. At present, only a small number of people ride in cars; the general public mainly uses streetcars and rickshaws. However, rickshaws and pedicabs are too expensive, and salaried employees and industrial and commercial workers dare not even inquire about the price. The streetcars and buses available to the public are overcrowded, making everyone sigh at the sight of them! This not only makes it impossible for people to be punctual for meetings but also affects office work efficiency. Writing that work starts at nine o'clock is often delayed due to crowded transportation. Even if one gets on a vehicle, it is so crowded that one can hardly breathe. Anyone in the workforce in Shanghai must have this difficulty, right?</p>
<p>This column takes serving society as its mission and is eager to find ways to solve this difficulty that the public cannot resolve. One is in the morning from the western district to the eastern district, and the other is every evening from the eastern district back to the western district. How can the transportation problem for thousands of people be solved? I am now designing a solution and hope that the transportation authorities will find a way to implement it. The plan is: every morning from eight to ten o'clock, add more streetcars at the end of Avenue Joffre and Jing'an Temple, running continuously, so that people going to offices in the eastern district do not have no vehicles to ride. From four to seven o'clock in the evening, conversely, add more streetcars on the Bund, constantly heading west. If there are not enough vehicles, there is another plan: please have the Public Utilities Bureau specially prepare dozens of buses to run "office special cars," running continuously every morning from eight to ten o'clock at Jing'an Temple, Avenue Foch, Avenue Haig, and the end of Avenue Joffre, heading east. Conversely, from four to seven o'clock in the evening, continuously run these "office special cars" westward at Nanjing Road, Avenue Chiang Kai-shek, Rue du Consulat, and the Bund, to avoid passenger congestion. In addition to this, are there any better plans? Please give us your advice. We also hope that the Public Utilities Bureau and the Streetcar Company authorities will study this matter carefully to alleviate the difficulty of citizens traveling. Because saving precious time means increasing work efficiency! (Reader opinions on this issue are welcome)</p>
<h3>My Views on Reviving Morality</h3>
<p>— Yong Yu</p>
<p>During the war, "the morality teacher was dismissed from school," so morality has declined day by day. Now that our country has won the Anti-Japanese War, the movement to revive morality is indeed an important task at the time of national reconstruction. Here are two of Yong Yu's views on the movement to revive morality:</p>
<p>(1) Public Opinion Sanctions: The power of public opinion can influence society. Regarding the movement to revive morality, I hope that the public opinion sector will lead and urge everyone to move towards the road of reviving morality. Regarding the current extravagant consumption, places of improper entertainment that can cause young people to degenerate and morality to be lost, I hope that the public opinion sector will impose sanctions. Also, regarding the immoral behavior of general merchants, I hope that the public opinion sector will expose it. At the same time, we should extinguish the recent trend of meaningless social gatherings in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Stabilizing People's Livelihood: Rising prices and unstable living conditions are major obstacles to promoting the revival of morality. Now, we want to "revive morality" and bring the country and society into an orderly and good state, to successfully build an independent, free, and democratic country, so that people have a sense of morality and enjoy material civilization. I think suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood are prerequisites.</p>
