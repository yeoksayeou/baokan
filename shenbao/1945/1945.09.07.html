<h3>國軍準備凱旋遊行　湯將軍今午抵滬　前進指揮所開會討論歡迎事宜</h3>
<p>負責方面昨日深晚發表，湯恩伯（見圖）將軍華於今日上午十一時前後　滬，孫元　將軍據聞亦將同來，前進指揮所刻正與有關各方聯絡，準備盛大歡迎。並擬　於湯將軍到達之後，舉行凱旋遊行，屆時業已抵滬之國軍先遣部隊，將以全副武裝之堂堂陣容遊行市區，俾渴　一　國軍英姿之海上人士得快先睹。並聞日軍方面亦經決定於湯將軍抵滬時，特派仗儀隊開往機場恭迎，籍雪中主持人召開幹部會議，商討歡迎湯將軍一切事宜，會後並將湯將軍蒞滬消息通知日方，令作一切必要之準備，屆時滬上各界代表均將前往機場歡迎。今日繼續飛滬之國軍，將為第三六二團及三六三團，由各該團長陳心，驍啟　領　，第四十九軍軍長牟延芳，亦將於今日飛滬。湯將軍略歷誌下：</p>
<p>湯將軍為浙江義鳥人，現年四十六歲，畢業於日本士官學校，曾任第八十九師師長，第十三軍軍長。七七事變前曾參與百靈　之役，聞名全國，抗戰爆發後，湯將軍統率一師堅守南口，身先士卒　血抗敵，予敵軍大打擊。二十八年任三十一集團軍總司令。曾參加鄂北　　，保衛貴陽。旋奉令成立　桂湘　區總司令部，指揮作戰。中國陸軍總司令部成立後，即改為第三立面軍。在日本降伏前同，中央受予反攻之重大任務，每役無不如限完成任務，如最近柳州·桂林·梧州等重鎭之光復，皆為湯將軍之偉大戰績。</p>
<p>湯將軍治軍頗嚴，面對人民尤其對青年，愛護備至，為人勇敢而急智，軍事上每遇危機情勢，均能化險為夷，反敗為勝。平時最愛好者為書籍，生活刻苦，除祇烟外，其他絕無嗜好。將軍愛護袍澤，如同家人，故部屬無不衷誠愛戴，不知將軍者或以湯將軍為一員猛將，殊不知其在平時實係一好學深思之儒將也。</p>

<p>大場機場一瞥</p>
<p>國軍本定前日來滬，後因氣候關係，　風甚烈，未能成行，昨晨風勢轉來，天晴氣朗，預計國軍必可抵滬，故全市各機關·各團體·均派代表前往歡迎。據記者探悉，計到有吳副市長代表莊　　，地方協會代表社月笙，忠救軍淞滬區指揮部代表淩元培，朱順林·孫家良，蘇浙皖區教育專員劉韶仲，總工會代表周學湘·方如升，中宣部辦事處費　民，市工農會代表萬墨林，市商會代表徐　廣，婦女會代表　劍秋，體育整理委員會代表陸翔千，青年勵志社代表潘子茂，女青年聯誼會代表林志萍，運輸業代表崔世富以及各區黨部，三民主議青年團各支分團，各學校，各同業公會，各區保甲代表，各民眾慰勞隊等數萬人，保甲方面並派老　保甲音樂隊到場奏樂歡迎，各報社記者以及電影新聞宣傅處派員攝拍新聞片，民眾均備慰勞物品，手持歡迎旗織，　立機場，空軍第二地區司令章　，率領官兵指揮場務，第三方面軍前進指揮所派　級參謀林日方到場指揮軍務，日本第十三軍（登部隊）等各在滬機關，亦派官司員到場歡迎，並派兵担任沿途及場內緊戒任務，上海憲兵隊則派兵維持秩序。</p>

<h3>最大規模空運　昨開始實現　我八萬大軍分運京滬</h3>
<p>中央社重慶六日電　中國戰區美軍司令部息，美空軍今開始大批運送中國軍隊至華東區，此運輸八萬中國軍隊及其裝備之空運，實為印緬區或中國戰區空運規模最大複雜者，亦為歷史上空運軍隊最大規模之一次。空運分二大部份工作，一部由美第十航空隊司令赫根伯格率領之運輸機，自芷江載運中國之新六軍赴南京，另一部份由美空運總部中印區司令　納率領之「Ｃ５４」式機，由柳州戰運中國之第九十四軍赴上海，空運之進行，誠為軍事史上之最困難者。日軍投降時，中國大部作戰部隊，均分布芷江，柳州各區，準備向華南反攻，重新打開廣州海港，今日軍既已投降，必須立由華軍收復京滬區，因此美陸軍航空隊逐負起此種任務，但美陸軍航空隊在中國戰區其他各處，尚有其他任務，過去以及現在，大部均係空運之接濟。此外，尚須立刻滿足許多緊急空運之需要，第一，為担任救濟之用者岧將糧食，醫藥及醫務人員等空運至　處越南以至東三省之各盟軍俘虜營，其次為須自印度空運三千五百人以重開上海之港口，以及將中國陸軍總部運至南京。此外，因中國車隊自陸上開赴收復區，途中經過糧食缺乏之地帶時，亦須賴空運接濟，因此特拉特梅耶納將軍等司令部內之專家，均多日夜工作計劃，使每一能被使用之運輸機，均能得最大限度之利用，例如為完成芷江至南京之運送，第「四四三」陸軍空運大隊，再加第「三三一」芷江，第「四四三」空運大隊，係來自印續職區，在第十九航空隊指揮之下，業在印緬區對於中英空軍隊之供應，創有優巽之紀　。而中印航空運總部亦派大批「C54」式機，以完成柳州至上海馬之運輸。最困難問題之一，為汽油之補充，因一切汽油均係由印度運來，第一航空隊一部份之汽油，由昆明運來，其餘均須由印度運來，沿芷江至南京各機場，均已分設油站，即將擔任柳州至上海一綫運輸之中印區空運總部之C54式機，將以孟加拉省之東部為基地，先自孟加拉省滿載汽油飛柳州，卸下多餘之汽油，改運軍隊飛上海，飛返柳州時，再加油飛印華備，再滿載汽油作第二次之空運。據估計，此兩部份中國陸軍運輸完畢，　時四十日，自芷江至南京之往返飛行距離，為一千八百英里，大規模空運之初步運輸，如載運中國憲兵，工程部隊，交通部隊及其他必需之人員等，均已完成，正式運輸　六軍赴專，已自今日開始，俟此次軍運完畢後，其他大規模空運中國人員至其他收復區計劃，即將開始。</p>

<h3>National Army Prepares for Triumphant Parade: General Tang Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon; Advance Headquarters Holds Meeting to Discuss Welcoming Arrangements</h3>
<p>The responsible parties announced late last night that General Tang Enbo (see picture) is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around 11:00 AM today. General Sun Yuan is also rumored to be arriving with him. The advance headquarters is currently coordinating with all relevant parties to prepare a grand welcome. It is also planned that after General Tang's arrival, a triumphant parade will be held. At that time, the advance troops of the National Army, who have already arrived in Shanghai, will parade through the city in full armor, so that people in Shanghai, who are eager to witness the heroic bearing of the National Army, can have a sneak peek. It is also heard that the Japanese side has also decided to send a honor guard to the airport to respectfully welcome General Tang upon his arrival, in order to show their respect. The person in charge convened a cadre meeting to discuss all matters related to welcoming General Tang. After the meeting, the Japanese side was notified of General Tang's arrival in Shanghai, so that they could make all necessary preparations. Representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai will go to the airport to welcome him today. The National Army, which will continue to fly to Shanghai today, will be the 362nd Regiment and the 363rd Regiment, led by their respective regimental commanders, Chen Xin, and Xiao Qi. Commander of the 49th Army, Mou Yanfang, will also fly to Shanghai today. A brief biography of General Tang is recorded below:</p>
<p>General Tang is a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang. He is 46 years old this year. He graduated from the Japanese Military Academy. He has served as the commander of the 89th Division and the commander of the 13th Army. Before the July 7th Incident, he participated in the Battle of Bailing, which made him famous throughout the country. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Tang led a division to firmly defend Nankou. He took the lead in resisting the enemy with blood and gave the enemy a heavy blow. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he was appointed commander-in-chief of the 31st Army Group. He participated in the Battle of Northern Hubei and defended Guiyang. He was then ordered to establish the Guilin-Hunan Area Headquarters to command operations. After the establishment of the Headquarters of the Chinese Army, it was changed to the Third Mobile Army. Before Japan surrendered, he was entrusted by the central government with the important task of counter-offensive. Every battle was completed as scheduled. The recent restoration of important towns such as Liuzhou, Guilin, and Wuzhou are all great achievements of General Tang.</p>
<p>General Tang is very strict in managing his army. He is especially kind to the people, especially the youth. He is brave and resourceful. In military affairs, he can always turn danger into safety and defeat into victory in crisis situations. His favorite thing in peacetime is books. He lives frugally and has no hobbies other than smoking. The general loves his comrades like family, so his subordinates sincerely love and respect him. Those who do not know the general may think that General Tang is a brave general, but they do not know that he is actually a learned and thoughtful Confucian general in peacetime.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Six Silver Eagles Arrive One After Another; All Circles Give Warm Welcome to Patriotic Soldiers</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The advance troops of the National Army, which were eagerly awaited by the five million citizens of the city, have been arriving at the Shanghai port since yesterday morning.

Yesterday, the advance troops that arrived in Shanghai totaled more than 2,000 soldiers. After the advance troops got off the plane, they temporarily stayed in the machine room next to Dachang Airport. Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life went to welcome them upon hearing the news. The cheers and firecrackers resounded through the sky. The situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Dachang Airport</p>
<p>The National Army was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but due to weather conditions, the wind was very strong, and it could not be realized. Yesterday morning, the wind turned around, the sky was clear and sunny, and it was expected that the National Army would definitely arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, all agencies and organizations in the city sent representatives to welcome them. According to reporters, Zhuang, the Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, was present as a representative of the municipal government. Du Yuesheng represented the local association. Ling Yuanpei, Zhu Shunlin, and Sun Jialiang represented the Headquarters of the Loyal and Patriotic Army in the Songhu area. Liu Shaozhong represented the education commissioner of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area. Zhou Xuexiang and Fang Rusheng represented the General Labor Union.

The Baojia also sent an old Baojia music team to the scene to play music to welcome them. Reporters from various newspapers and personnel from the Film News Propaganda Office were sent to shoot newsreels. The people prepared consolation items and held welcome flags, standing on the airport. Zhang, the commander of the Second Air Force Region, led his officers and soldiers to direct the field affairs. Lin Rifang, a staff officer sent by the advance headquarters of the Third Front Army, was present to direct military affairs. The Japanese 13th Army (Deng Detachment) and other organizations in Shanghai also sent officials to the scene to welcome them, and sent troops to take on the task of tightening security along the way and inside the venue. The Shanghai Military Police Corps sent troops to maintain order.</p>
<p>Arrival of National Heroes</p>
<p>At 7:30, a huge silver eagle was spotted in the sky. Amidst the cheers and firecrackers of the entire population, the first giant silver eagle carrying the advance troops of the National Army landed at Dachang Airport. The Fifth Company officers and soldiers totaled eighty, led by Wang. Twenty minutes later, the second plane arrived and landed at the airport. Five officers and seventy-five soldiers from the Sixth Company, led by Company Commander Kong Jun. At 9:10, the third and fourth planes landed one after another, carrying the machine gun company, led by Company Commanders Jin Ronggang and Wu Wenxue respectively. In less than a quarter of an hour, the fifth plane landed. In addition to Yang Wen, Deputy Commander of the 49th Army of the Third Front Army, and Xie Shiqin, Commander of the 361st Regiment, senior officers and soldiers got off the plane one after another. Deputy Commander Yang was wearing a blue military uniform and was full of energy. The National Army was young and strong, all equipped with the latest equipment. After General Yang got off the plane, he smiled and nodded to the welcomers. Reporters and photographers were extremely active at this time, filming and requesting autographs. Zhuang, the Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and Fei from the Shanghai Office of the Central Propaganda Department, treated them warmly and offered refreshments. At this time, the Dachang Town public welfare team presented a large number of consolation items such as soda and bread to Deputy Commander Yang. The Shanghai Young Women's Association presented a banner with the words "Glorious Soldiers, Bringing Glory to the Country." Representatives from various groups and organizations also submitted their name cards to pay their respects. After a short rest, Deputy Commander Yang was accompanied by Zhuang and other representatives from various agencies and organizations to get on the car, and was led by the welcome vehicles of various public groups, departing from Dachang to the city center.</p>
<p>From Sichuan Road to Nanjing Road, they passed Jing'an Temple Road to the west, turned from Haig Road to Moffett Road, turned into Min Tiniyin Road, and turned to Edward Road to inspect the Bund. The people along the way stood respectfully on the road, cheering enthusiastically and setting off firecrackers to welcome the national heroes. Deputy Commander Yang, seeing the enthusiasm of the people in the car, and recalling the pain suffered by the people in the past eight years, was deeply moved, and tears filled his eyes, but he still forced a smile and nodded to express his gratitude. Finally, he went to the forward headquarters of the army in the Hua Hotel to visit Director Zhang. At this time, the female youth group of the Shanghai branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League sent representatives to the Hua Hotel to present flowers to Deputy Commander Yang and others to pay their respects.</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Zhang's Speech</p>
<p>The sixth plane landed at 10:45, also carrying 80 National Army soldiers. At this time, the Shanghai public welfare orchestra took over, and the National Army stepped out of the plane to the melodious music, and the people cheered. At 10:55, another giant plane appeared in the sky and landed immediately. General Zhu Jingmin, Commander of the 121st Division of the National Army, also took the plane. After getting off the plane, he was surrounded by newspaper reporters, photography reporters, and representatives from all walks of life. Zhu once told reporters from the Central News Agency: He was injured in defending Shanghai eight years ago. Today, he is very happy to meet again in the old place. According to Zhu, the entire division can be transported to this place in two or three days. Xie's regiment can be fully transported today. The number of C54 aircraft flying from Liuzhou to transport the National Army is extremely large. In the future, they will continue to be airlifted to Shanghai. An aircraft will take off from Liuzhou every considerable period of time. After various news reporters interviewed Zhu and asked him to make a statement, Zhu politely declined and stepped into the barracks, ordering his troops to guard the airport. Then he went to the Second Regional Headquarters for a short rest. Afterwards, every twenty to forty minutes, a transport plane carrying the National Army would arrive. In total, twenty-six giant transport planes carrying the National Army arrived in Shanghai yesterday, half of which were four-engine C54s and half were C46 transport planes. After most of the soldiers of the 361st Regiment of the advance troops were transported to Dachang Airport, Deputy Commander Zhang Zhong accompanied Deputy Commander Yang to the airport to summon all the soldiers and give them a speech, admonishing them to strictly observe discipline, love the people, and treat the surrendered Japanese army with the demeanor of a great power. After the speech, all the soldiers returned to their teams and entered the barracks. Some of them were stationed at Dachang Airport, and the rest were stationed at Shanghai and Fudan Universities. The forward headquarters of the Third Front Army is currently looking for suitable locations for the barracks required for the troops that will continue to arrive in Shanghai in the future.</p>

<h3>The Largest-Scale Airlift Began to Materialize Yesterday; 80,000 of Our Troops Will Be Transported to Beijing and Shanghai Separately</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th – According to the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater, the US Air Force will begin transporting Chinese troops to East China in large numbers today. This airlift of 80,000 Chinese troops and their equipment is the largest and most complex airlift in the India-Burma region or the China Theater, and it is also the largest-scale airlift of troops in history. The airlift is divided into two major parts: One part is the transport planes led by General Hickenberger, commander of the US Tenth Air Force, which will transport China's New Sixth Army from Zhijiang to Nanjing. The other part is the "C54" aircraft led by Commander Tranah of the US Air Transport Command India-China Division, which will transport China's Ninety-Fourth Army from Liuzhou to Shanghai. The implementation of the airlift is truly one of the most difficult in military history. At the time of Japan's surrender, most of China's combat troops were distributed in the Zhijiang and Liuzhou areas, preparing to counterattack South China and reopen the port of Guangzhou. Now that the Japanese army has surrendered, it is imperative that the Chinese army recover the Beijing-Shanghai area as soon as possible. Therefore, the US Army Air Corps has undertaken this task. However, the US Army Air Corps has other tasks in other parts of the China Theater. In the past and now, most of them have been used for airlift supplies. In addition, many urgent airlift needs must be met immediately. First, for relief purposes, food, medicine, and medical personnel are airlifted to various Allied prisoner camps in Indochina, Vietnam, and even Manchuria. Secondly, 3,500 people must be airlifted from India to reopen the port of Shanghai, and the Headquarters of the Chinese Army must be transported to Nanjing. In addition, since Chinese motorcades are traveling overland to the recovered areas, they must also rely on airlifts for supplies when passing through food-deficient areas. Therefore, experts in the headquarters of Generals Tratamayer and others have been working day and night to plan so that every available transport plane can be used to the maximum extent. For example, in order to complete the transportation from Zhijiang to Nanjing, the "443rd" Army Air Transport Group, plus the "331st" Zhijiang, the "443rd" Air Transport Group, which came from the continued employment area in India, and under the command of the 19th Air Force, has created an excellent record in supplying the Chinese and British air forces in the India-Burma region. The India-China Air Transport Command has also dispatched a large number of "C54" aircraft to complete the transportation from Liuzhou to Shanghai. One of the most difficult problems is the replenishment of gasoline, because all the gasoline is transported from India. Part of the gasoline of the First Air Force is transported from Kunming, and the rest must be transported from India. Gas stations have been set up along the airports from Zhijiang to Nanjing. The C54 aircraft of the India-China Air Transport Command, which will be responsible for the transportation line from Liuzhou to Shanghai, will use the eastern part of Bengal as its base. It will first fly from Bengal to Liuzhou fully loaded with gasoline, unload the excess gasoline, transport troops to Shanghai, and when flying back to Liuzhou, it will refuel and fly to India for backup. It will then fully load gasoline for the second airlift. It is estimated that the transportation of these two parts of the Chinese army will be completed in 40 days. The round-trip flight distance from Zhijiang to Nanjing is 1,800 miles. The initial transportation of large-scale airlifts, such as transporting Chinese military police, engineering troops, transportation troops, and other necessary personnel, has been completed. The official transportation of the Sixth Army to Nanjing has begun today. After the completion of this military transport, other large-scale plans for airlifting Chinese personnel to other recovered areas will begin.</p>
