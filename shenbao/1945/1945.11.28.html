<h3>國軍續進直趨瀋陽　右翼東轉向營口進兵</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿七日電〕報載沿北寗路前進國軍，今日續由錦州向前推進一百二十里，到達溝帮子，離瀋陽已不足二百七十里。又據未證實消息，蘇聯已允將東北防務交由國軍擔任，惟蘇軍撤退日期，將延至明年一月。傳蘇聯已負責保證由空路開赴務陽或長春國軍之安全，共軍在該兩地現甚活躍。聞蘇聯所以讓步，係因兩國關係業經改善，據未證實消息稱：蘇聯表示願恪守中蘇友好條約之精神。中國官方續稱，接收東北之下級官員，由關內歸返長春者已有不少，東北特派員蔣經國亦將遄返長春，與蘇方交涉國軍由空路開往東北事宜。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿七日電〕據今日此間消息：沿北寗路向潘陽推進之中央軍，現遭鮑文樾部下之僞滿軍與雜色部隊之抵抗。鮑氏爲南京僞軍事委員會之總參謀長，在日本投降一月前，鮑氏由陳公博任命爲河南僞省政府主席。東京接受波茨坦宣言後，鮑氏即趕赴東北，收集滿軍舊部。滿洲老軍閥數人，與其同流合汚，高唱「滿洲人之滿洲」，阻止國軍開入東九省，妄圖逃避附逆罪名，並保持彼等在故省之軍事勢力。共軍之要點錦州，前傳有朱德部下第八路軍之裝甲師二師駐於該地，然經三小時之爭奪後，即爲國軍佔領。當國軍主力疾進抵溝帮子之際，其右翼已東轉向營口進兵。國軍佔領此黃海港口後，將獲海上增援部隊之另一上陸地點。營口且爲一鐵路中心。</p>
<h3>北平一帶國軍　向長城各要隘進逼</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二十七日電〕傳馬林諾夫斯基將軍提議將蘇軍撤退日期，延至明年一月三日，以便協助國軍接收蘇軍佔領區域。又悉東北保安司令杜聿明所屬部隊，今日似在掃蕩錦州及葫蘆島一帶共軍，以作進攻瀋陽之準備。據傳瀋陽共軍僅有數千人。</p>
<p>負責方面稱：馬林諾夫斯基對於國軍和平接收共產軍佔領區一事，並未加以援助。國軍在東九省南部，現正加强其地位，據報葫蘆島不久即可代替秦皇島，而作為國軍主要據點。北平一帶國軍，正向東北方之古北口長城要隘進逼，其最後目標在熱河之承德，俾得進而佔領熱河高原地帶，以掩護國軍向東九省南部平原之深入。</p>
<h3>高經濟會首次會償還　宋院長提三原則</h3>
<p>抱大無畏精神澈底實現經濟建設政策</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕最高經濟委會廿六日首次會議，宋院長致詞，全文如次：主席，諸位委員，諸位先生，今天本會成立，承主席到會致訓，使本會進行施政的方針，得到極明白的指示，非常感奮。本會旣然是經濟政策最高決定的機關，所擔負的任務，是與國計民生要發生最密切的關係，責任實在是十分朮大。現在我們面臨着無數困難，使任何經濟建設政策，遭遇龐大的阻力。我們必須要抱着大無畏的精神，去克服這種困難，使經濟建設的政策能够澈底實現，正如剛才主席訓辭所指示，在基本條件得到適合解決的時候，我國國民經濟的繁榮，可以進入一個以前從未達到的階段。至於在什麼時候可以達到這個階段，我們必須先要認淸，非但政府負責的人要努力苦幹，環境要從速改善，而且將來所採取的經濟方案，要適合我國國情，同時也不違反經濟的原理，所以在決定方案以前，必須要詳盡的研究。在實行這方案以前，尤其要有審愼的準備。今天本會成立，應當把幾個簡單扼要的原則，就是指政府惟行經濟政策的時候，對人民對政府本身及對各友邦三方面的原則，提出如下：</p>
<h3>對人民方面　扶助經濟活動</h3>
<p>第一，對人民方面　政府要指導人民的經濟事業，使其能活潑發展，不是去管制這種事業，而且要扶助人民的經濟活動，使其能順利進行，不是去干涉這種活動。但是指導及扶助亦有相當的界限，不是說人民對政府可以取完全依賴的態度，而是人民在經濟方面，要不忘「自力史生」的根本原則，無論是工業，或是商業，或是金融，或是農業，不論規模大小，要用自己的力量，憑自已的膽識，去辦到成功。一切人民事業的成功，祇要不越出政府經濟政策的範圍，即是爲國家，爲社會，爲國民經濟盡一部份的責任，但是如果人民不從「自助」的出發點努力前進，以爲政府可以不斷的犧牲國庫財力，來維持一個在經濟立塲上不能支持的局面，這是人大的錯誤。</p>
<p>四個重要範團</p>
<p>至于政府指導及扶助的具體表現，不在供給資金，而是在下列四個重要範團：</p>
<p>甲·關於技術的，政府因其地位及其集中的力量，比較人民易於取得國內外高新最高深的科學知識，及延攬第一流技術人才的機會，將來應在多方面有適當的機構，作爲指導農工商業試騐及改進之核心。</p>
<p>乙·關於金融的，政府當前有一個蛟迫切的問題，就是如何整理財政，安定余融，能够解決這問題，即是給人民經濟最基本的扶助。因為物價金融不能穩定，一切生產事業即不敢放胆前進，勞力問題無從得到一個長期的解決。高利息不能跌落，生產即難活潑，所以政府要先從安定金融入手，扶助人民經濟。</p>
<p>丙·關於交通運輸最應注意，理由極爲明顯，現在農工商業復典之重大障碍，當是長期抗戰後運輸工具的大量破壞，及各地方交通的梗阻，政府扶助人民經濟發展，最有效的辦法，是積極恢復主要鐵路綫，長江及沿海航綫，內地重要公路，以及進一步，完成各大都市間的空運。</p>
<p>丁，關於動力的，現代生產機械化的必不可缺之條件，即必須有價廉的動力。所以政府要扶助人民經濟發展，應先注意煤的生產及各　產煤的分配情形，將來工業發展到相當時候，長江中部能够得到到適合經濟條件的程度，政府應不惜巨大資本，開發大規模水力發電事業，並先要作種種技術上的準備。以上四項，不過舉出政府對人民方面經濟政策最重要的原則，但政府對人民經濟發展，應盡的義務及人民所應期望於政府的協助，大致已略述及。</p>
<h3>對政府本身　平衡經濟政策</h3>
<p>第二，對政府本身方面　本會對於政府各部門之經濟政策，有平衡及調整的責任。所謂平衡，是指政府與人民對於我國國民每年爲生產事業之支配，亦應保持平衡。前一點，因爲一個國家每年生產所得，是有限的，如果政府所耗費的部份太大，其結果自然會使人民的生產力受到打擊，所以政府必須限制其自身的支出範圍，以免將全國生產所得過分消費，以致失其平衡。後一點，因爲政府所經營之事業，必須具有國營之充分理由，吾則其結果非但國庫要增加不必要之負擔，對於財政金融的安定，也要受到威脅，而且政府及人民間生產事業的支配，亦將失其平衡。所謂平衡的意義，不是說兩方平均，平均分配，而是一個輕重合理的分配。所謂調整，是指政府各部門所辦的事業，如有重複，必須加以調整。各部門推行的經濟政策，如有矛盾，也必須加以調整，所以對政府本身的支出及經營的事業，暨推行的政策，有負通盤籌劃的責任。</p>
<h3>對友邦方面　坦白互惠合作</h3>
<p>第三，對於友邦方面　政府對各友邦，在經濟上應以合作爲前提，其方式是絕對坦白互惠的，而且毫無偏倚的，其範圍大致可分爲技術的合作，機務上的合作及金融上的合作。就技術方面說。木會應當領導保持與工程科學先進國家作雙方有益的接觸，使人民及政府各部門的經濟發展，增進其速度。就商務方面說，應當設法使一切關於國際貿易及國際滙兌方面，得到雙方有利的協調。就金融方面說，應當與友邦協力，使一方面尋求出路之資本，得到合於經濟條件的流動，同時，一方面加以合理運川，可以增加國內生產的力量，以上三種國際經濟合作，均可直接的或問接的助成並提前我國國民經濟繁榮的實現。以上很簡略的舉出本會今後進行的目標，所望在主席領導之下，脚踏實地，愼重進行，允望諸位會員對於今後責重事繁的經濟規劃，多予助力。</p>
<h3>美駐華大使　赫爾利辭職</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電。美駐華大使赫爾利已辭職，渠認爲閂亞洲政策之失敗，係由於美國外交當局之懦弱與反對所致。</p>
<h3>熊漱冰胡致　任贛省府委</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕國府廿七日令：江西省政府委員兼財政廳　長文羣，委員兼秘書長胡家鳳呈請辭職，文羣，胡家鳳均准免本兼各職，此令，任命熊漱冰，胡致爲江西省政府委員，此令。在命熊漱冰兼江西省政府財政廳廳長，此令。</p>
<h3>抗戰結束日期　定為九月三日</h3>
<p>戰時法規同時廢止</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕國府所頒各種戰時法規，多定有實用期間，俟戰事結束或結束後若干明期內，即須廢止，因此關於抗結束日期自應明白夫定，俾資依據。聞國府即以本年九月三日盟國花東京受降之日，定爲抗戰戰事結束日期。</p>
<h3>政治會議下月一日召開　出席人員名單擬就</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕張羣於成都發表談話謂：政治會議下月一日准開，惟就此間之觀察，須視周恩來返延安結果如何而定。名單幾經磋商，現已全部擬出，的如下述：</p>

<h3>蔣廷黻定今日返渝　救濟工作決全民化　在共軍區域同樣推進救濟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）中國善後救濟總署署長蔣廷黻，昨與聯合國善後救濟總署副署長韓雷生，在華懋飯店聯合招待本市新聞界，報告此次巡視全國經過，說明善後救濟工作推進途徑。在招待席上，最堪注意的，是蔣氏闡明該署工作全民化的一點。蔣氏說，我們工作以全國人民爲對象，地無分南北東西，人無分黨派宗敎，皆一視同仁。救濟的原則以破壞的程度和受損的情形爲標準。本人離渝前，曾與周恩來氏談及此點，周氏很表贊同，並和他約定本署工作人員及救濟物資，倘能得到保障，則善後救濟工作在共軍區域亦同時同樣推進。</p>
<p>關於抑平物價，蔣氏說：本署工作大目標之一，是協助政府和民衆積極抑止通貨膨脹，及物價上升。一部份救濟物資將在各地平價出售，以期平衡物價。同時，將以此種方式，取得資金，以推進其他善後建設工作政府今年撥於各項善後救濟費用，已達一億元以上，明年預算，將增至四億元。又蔣氏定今日返渝韓雷生亦定期返美一行。</p>
<p>蔣氏答記者問時，補充說：本署應宋慶齡女士之請，已在渝收集大量醫藥用品，準備以卡車運赴共軍區。余曾與宋女士言明，該項藥品於領用時，只須醫院院長出具收據，別無其他條件。</p>
<p>二三年內保無饑荒</p>
<p>關於善後救濟工作之前途，蔣氏說：我們最後要靠自己的努力，抗戰八年，我國困難很多，能力有限，然我政府已下了決心，期善後工作能得成效。我可大膽保證三件事：（一）聨合國予我的協助，一定很大。（二）中國各地在二年內可保證無饑荒。（三）在二三年內中國可保證無瘟疫。我素喜研究歷史，過去國家經過大戰，需三四十年方能復原，我希望我國此次用近代科學的方式，和由盟國的輔助，能在四五年內，恢復戰爭中喪失殆盡的原氣。</p>
<p>韓雷生氏報吿工作</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕蔣署長發言前，由韓雷生民報告，略稱：（一）來華後曾謁蔣主席，宋院長等，並先後到各地視察，所得印象極佳，在視察桂林·柳州·漢口·天津·北平·廣州·衡陽以及其他縣鄉之後，覺得最嚴重之問題爲，甲，交通工具缺乏，乙，冬用燃煤不敷分配，丙，藥品·醫院·醫生·衣服·食糧之供應，亦待解決。（二）補救以上諸困難，總署已擬定工作辦法，工作已在開展中，對中國之工作，即設法運輪救濟品來華，並助中國解決戰後困難，運輸物資來華之船隻，已有五艘抵中國，九至十艘在途中，平均每月可有救濟船三十艘抵華，每船的載重八千噸。</p>
<p>運華物資轉輸內地</p>
<p>物品運華後如何再運入內地，又須澈底解決，吾人將利用飛機·船隻·火車·汽車等作運輸工具，甲，船隻方面，將來英·美·加·挪各國之船隻，均參加此項工作，各船運載價値四百萬美元，乙，車輛方面，已有六百輛運輸車到華，一千零五十輛在途中，以後續有增加，此外並有登陸船適宜內河航行，丙，鐵路運輸最成問題，因美軍無剩餘物質，以修理被毁之鐵道，車輛亦供不應求，此事望中國政府速覓解決辦法。（三）大量醫院物品·棉花·紗布·將續運來，並由自英·美·加·澳洲。紐西蘭搜集衣服一千萬磅（每磅價値十一元美金），已在運連華途中。</p>
<p>中國必需自力重建</p>
<p>韓雷生最後稱，中國經過八年抗戰，受災至重，其一切困難必需中國自身求解決之法。外方之救濟，只是一種助力，中國之重建，必由中國努力，乃成功，救濟總署工作，至一九四七年三月爲止，故中國救濟署資任至重，彼對中國之重建，寄予至大期望。</p>

<h3>專論　評所謂幣原政策</h3>
<p>— 章士釗</p>
<p>幣原政策者，國際論壇舊名詞之一，或又曰幣原外交。幣原自一九二四，下逮一九三一年，在日本七內閣中，六居外相，時國勢渡强，羣雄側目，陽假交隣有道之美名，陰極縱橫裨闔之能事。三　貴壻，坐攝霞關，烜赫之餘，忽來橫逆。九一八之變，彼審關東軍之妄動，將大不利於社稷也，慨然宣於衆曰：「日本吞一爆炸彈矣！」坐是很迕軍閥，沉廢不進者十年有奇。敗後復起，收拾殘局，戒愼於神武之厄運，趦趄於客帥之大門，晚節末路，至可憫歎。平情論之，此殆迫於愛國心之不得不然，非其好也。</p>
<p>紐約午報，指斥幣原，的分數義：一，軍閥主武力侵略，其勢急，財閥主經濟侵略，其勢緩。幣原乘財閥之安車，通軍閥之大道，所異者手段與工具耳，侵略之罪一也。二，日政治家尾畸齋藤之流，以反抗侵略鳴於時，幣原內閣，名爲網羅全國人才，而乃外而不求，屛而不錄。反之，戰時爲軍閥張目之日銀總裁農澤，出入帷幕，倚作干城，侵略之本不拔，國政其何能淑？三，美國務卿暨陸海軍，曾經聯合聲明，日本神道應須消除。夫神道者，天島之權源也，幣原又拄天皇制度，不遺餘力，天皇神化乃至侵略神化之風，如何能絕？四，前美國駐日大使格魯，號爲日本通者也，彼草使日十年一書，贊揚幣原外交，不卹以開明二字歸之。顧開明與溫和有別，幣原之爲人，溫和誠有之，而開明則米也。夫溫利何常之有？經濟侵略，正惟以循循浸潤之故，致被侵略國魚爛以亡而不自知。</p>
<p>右四義者，豈惟紐約午報持論如是，即吾國公私論議，口誅筆伐，問亦類是。嘗見東州京專電載幣原所告記者團追惜東三省一段，語極尋常，而標題則稱幣原諉責於我，言多荒謬。夫荒謬之爲義尚輕，對記者之談話亦末，即小見大，可概其餘。竊意戰敗國之政府，氣餒力孱，動輒得咎，其息息以求得戰勝國之同情爲職志者，情也，亦勢也。倘庶幾同情者，而亦不免於輕蔑謾駡以終，將不至使之手足無所措，甚且悵惘引咎，狼狽離職不止。此觀於第一次大戰後之德意志而可知也。當時柏林政府，確無復警打算，一意求與協約國協調，而以導誘其國民於民主自由之域爲歸。無奈戰勝國尋垢索搬，日甚一日，馴致民間恨政府賣國媚外，狙擊頻仍，以學問優長心氣平和之勞敦老Rathenlaw主持外務，而首領不保，表裏夾持，內閣起蹶靡常，即起亦不獲一夕安枕。居無何，希特勒　機驟入，負整以趨，舉日耳曼而納粹之，行所無事。第二大戰之火山，即伏脈於斯！斯皆今之政家所親見，豈不朗朋可鑑？</p>
<p>夫日本　仇國也，而幣原爲仇相，遽以與吾和同一致之見解，責之於手握覇　之十年前，似嫌不諒。今其人以七十高年，勉常難局，彼執兩用中之精神，在斯時庶幾最適，與和平之德之勞敦老正同。須知日本人之反對幣原者，由東京諸新聞紙及各黨派宣言觀之，已紛紛然不可數。盟軍一假以隙，若輩得所藉手，以事刃於幣原之胸，其內閣之崩潰，與摧枯拉朽無異。何人再起，其難盡如日本反對者之意，平流而進，吉祥止止，復與燭照數計相同，展轉爲之，每况愈下，非復返於極右，或將趨於極左，偏激橫決，不徒杞人之憂已。</p>
<p>近月以來，歐洲均勢之論，又漸發舒。彼中雋士，指中美蘇爲三系，謀別立西歐聯盟以抗之。彼日本者，外交應有若干時不能獨立，彼將何所併入，以期遂步自張其軍，此日本之事，惟吾中國自問是否能成一系，自今宜作何準備，豈能佯爲不知？國人自美洲歸老，每言美人已不談珍珠港事，復譬之論，不聞諸恒人之口，此可見羊乞Yankee之高人一等處。吾國力之於美洲，低下已不可計，倘智力復相去爾遠，結果吾何敢知！然則爲之奈何？曰，日本明治以還。以七十年之慘澹經營，超取戰前之强國地位，談何容易，今一敗而盡隳所有，其中心之鬱憤與其激蕩，不言可喻，屈膝請和於戰力遠遜之我國，其恥辱更不言可喻。日本夙以東亞霜者自居，不以平等待我，我無從覓取有利外交塗徑。今乃天奪其魄，作孽難　，吾以大國風度，唯斟酌於「德」與「直」間，以報焉云爾，允而效之，寗吾所規？績效如何，及親我與吾，豐亦不間。總之，為今之計，吾圖消彼　憤掩彼恥辱之不暇，而又何事挑撥而激發之者？持此以繩幣原內閣，思過半矣。</p>

<h3>授權總統案　美參院展開激辯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕參議院展開授權杜魯門派遣美軍與其他聯合國一致制裁侵略一案之辯論後，今日外委會主席康納爾指出聯合國機構爲「預防劑」，可用以制止未蔓延之戰禍。渠又注視東印·伊朗·中國·巴勒斯坦·阿根廷與西班牙之騷動，視聯合國機構爲「密雲不雨之空中唯一明晴地帶「。其言曰，「余等唯有保持美國氣派，始能最有裨助於世界和平。職此之故，余之立塲始終反對足以掩埋美國之世界聯邦」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕美參議員巴爾福爾勃拉德及戴樂今日提議，謂聯合國機構之實力，或不足以防止原子炸彈戰爭，不如組織一世界政府較爲有效，但即遭外委會主席康納爾駁斥。據稱，印度有人口三萬萬，中國四萬萬，蘇聯一萬萬七千五百萬，其人數的遠在美國之上，世界政府一旦成立，美國在人口數字上將見落後。戴樂答稱，予寧願在世界政府中爲他人壓倒，而不願死於原子炸彈。</p>

<h3>漢城發生恐怖行動</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿六日電〕漢城現發生恐怖行動，恐怖份子多人闖入谷報館，抗議各報之刋載一不公止消息」。據漢城當地記者稱，新聞記者若干人，被恐怖份子暴力架去，施以恐　及痛毆，當地記者因此極感不安。此項恐怖行動與本月二十日自稱爲建國靑年團之圖謀搗亂人民黨一會議之暴行相似。</p>
<h3>日戰犯名單　我已送麥帥　日皇不在內</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿七日電〕麥帥參謀長發言人今日宣稱，中國政府所提日本戰犯名單，業已送達麥帥總部。惟名單上所列戰犯，僅十數人，遠不如謠傳之多。據悉名單中並無日皇在內。</p>
<h3>日小型潛艇　百艘被拆毀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社日本吳軍港廿七日電〕日小型潛艇約百艘，現由美軍第四十一師在此拆毁。此項潛艇每艘祇有艇員兩人，係與其他船隻一同交出者。各灃艇在　船塢底本擬引水灌人，使之生銹，今以廢料數百噸枇於其上完全蓋沒，工作更見澈底。</p>
<h3>陰霾籠罩秋雨連綿　日本議會昨開幕　照例宣主動軸日皇詔書</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿七日電〕日本非常議會今晨在華麗之貴族院開幕，日皇裕仁照例出席，以遲鈍語氣，宣讀官樣文章之詔書，上下兩院議員照例深深鞠躬虔聽。日皇座位之右爲皇族親王及宮內省官員，其右則爲幣原首相。詔書開宗明養第一章，即爲修改現行選舉法，似僅以衆院爲限，此外壓制人民各種現行法律均須加以廢止，大地產之分配及勞工法之訂立，均須一一推行，此爲日本有史以來所未有。裕仁歷次出席，均衣金瑩輝煌之軍裝，今則易以新制禮服，面無笑容，在全院默默無聲中，快步行至皇座前，其時院內諸人已靜候十分鐘矣。裕仁之兄秩父宮未出席，聞係抱病之故，高松宮則衣海軍制服佩綢帶出席，三笠宮則衣陸軍制服。議會今日開幕時，天氣陰黑，秋雨綿綿不絕，據稱亦是照例如此。</p>
<h3>日幣原內閣　獲喘息機會</h3>
<p>停付恩俸令准展緩執行</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕日政界消息稱：幣原內閣所遭臨之危機，現暫告平息。麥帥原指令日政府立即停止一切軍人之恩給金，但經幣原親自向麥帥解釋，倘該令立即付諸實施，則內閣將遭嚴重危機，並請求麥帥將該令展緩至明年二月一日實行後，麥帥已准許展期。麥帥此令，對日軍人之打擊，顯較迭次命令更大，在恩給金制度下，日陸海軍退伍官員均能暫獲生活安完，如經停止則此輩軍人將無時間與機會，設法恢復其地位矣。麥帥最近令取消日軍人一切組織之舉，對大部日退伍軍人亦打擊頗大，麥帥打擊戰時非法利得者及謀利軍人之政策，似進行頗佳。又據內閣法制局長奈良橋亘今日於談話中表示，相信內閣能渡過今日召開之議會一重難關，按議會今晨舉行簡單之開幕禮後，明日將開始討論各實際問題。</p>

<h3>東印度議會決議　阻英軍援荷　籲請人民能各出全力</h3>

<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿七日合衆社電〕印度尼西亞國會昨日在此開會時，宣佈泗水軍事衝突引起之華僑死傷，共達五萬五千人，而將此次爪哇事件之責任，完全諉諸英國。</p>

<h3>救濟總署將撥欵　八億元予我國</h3>
<p>美參院通過撥欵予總署　助其推行明年工作經費</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿六日專電〕美參院撥款委員會本日通過　款所餘未付之五萬五千萬美元，予聯合國救濟善中後總署後，美國原定撥子總署之款項之未撥部份，即可如數撥溝，就中國言，救濟總署將可依照規定，首先撥予中國八億笑元。衆院外交委員會亦通過對救濟總署之十三億五千萬元之撥　，此亦即美國撥予總署助其推進明年工作之經費。本日訊：新提案將於衆院聖誕節休會前提付辯論，該案經衆院通過後，將提交參院批准，繼之再行撥款。杜魯門總統李門署長及艾森　威爾元帥，雖已欲請即時撥款予聯合國救濟善後總署，　直至今日，國會猶無批准之意。國會　　不決，可能係由：（一）救濟總工工作不力；（二）救濟總署大部份救濟物資，係運往蘇聯控制之下巴爾幹半島及東歐。據稱：在該區工作之總署官員，竟不能獲得關於物資如何分配及工作如何推進之自由及公正之報告。除尋常之政黨政爭外，國會之立法爭議，亦爲促成稽延不決之理由。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕據悉：任何國家祇須准許新聞記者入境，報並告總署活動情形，而不加限制者，均可請求總　救濟。</p>
<h3>美國向英蘇建議　速撤駐伊朗軍隊　英促蘇注意對伊三國條約</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十七日電〕國務院昨透露：美政府已向英蘇政府建議，伊朗境內外國駐軍，應於明年一月一日以前，撤退完畢。國務院於十一月二十四日致莫斯科之服會有謂，美政府已訓令伊朗美軍當局立即開始準備，務期一月一日美軍全部退出伊朗。該照會曾提及一九四三年關於伊朗獨立主權及領土完整之德黑蘭宣言，並謂鑒於該地發展之情形。美政府認爲英美蘇駐軍應立即自伊撤退。蓋軍隊留駐伊朗，不免發生糾紛及誤解。美政府之照會繼云，伊朗政府有使其軍隊在國內任何部份活動之自由。美政府深知當地蘇軍司令或有阻止伊軍自由行動者，然此等措施，當係未經蘇政府所批准者。如蘇軍司令未奉本國政府之令而行事，想蘇政府應已令其遵重前所述及之宣言矣。一九四二年之英蘇伊條約規定外國駐軍須於對德及其盟國戰事結束後之六月內退出伊朗，故自日本投降日起算，則外國駐軍應於明年三月二日前退出伊朗。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十七日電〕英駐蘇大使寇爾爵士當已就伊朗境內之事件，向蘇人民外交委負長莫洛托夫提出照會，請其注意一九四二年英蘇伊條約之規定，及一九四三年十二月德黑蘭宣言之內容，並謂當地蘇軍司令之行動，或係出於悮解。</p>

<h3>晨友湅籃球　今日甲組二塲　綠林對華僑</h3>
<p>德勝戰V隊</p>
<p>晨友盃籃球聯賽，今日照例有甲組二幕，外另增友誼賽一塲，門票售一百元。</p>
<p>第一塲爲綠林逢華僑，綠林有錢旭滄之指導，循規蹈矩，有顯著之進步。不論攻守，俱見頭頭是道，惜尚少一獲分之錀，吾則戰績自可更予人滿意。今與華僑之戰，當可奪得勝利。</p>
<p>第二塲爲德勝與V隊相逢，德勝俱係一般沙塲老將，經騐勝人一等，但長力不逮耳。V隊則皆為後起之秀，勁力充沛，唯臨陣難鎭靜，故兩隊各有優劣，一且乍遇，酣戰難免，另增插曲為華聯對美憲兵隊，據云美憲兵將出動全部精說，當有一番精彩。今日秩序如下：</p>

<h3>印度國際大學的輪廓</h3>
<p>— 樂達觀</p>
<p>旬前各報載印度國際大學中國學院院長譚雲山先生，晋謁蔣主席於陪都，我想國際大學這個名字，在普通一般人的心目中，恐並不是怎樣熟悉的龍！</p>
<p>國際大學是印度詩聖太戈爾（Dr.Ralindranth　Tagore）的父親于公元一九〇二年所手創的，至今已有四十多年悠久的歷史了。</p>
<p>從加爾各德的蒙拉車站搭車，經過火龍數小時的駛行，就到達了鮑爾波，再步行一二時左右，國際大學就在望了，原來　的所在地是在印度孟加拉（Bengal）省鮑爾波（Bolpar）小鎭附近的聖帝尼喀坦（Santiniketan）地方。那裏本是荒涼無壞，一片不毛之地，匪盜出沒，「詩聖」的父母親，日夜默禱，後來一　盜匪受到太戈爾父母親的感化，就充邪歸正，這個地方也就成了弦歌聲不絕的學術之府。</p>
<p>在一九一三年的時候，「詩豐」得到了瑞典文學會所授所與的諾貝爾獎金，他就將這獎金全部作為與辦這所所大學的經費，一九二〇年，第一次歐戰後，太戈爾歐遊歸國，便正式定名爲國際大學，溶東西和世界的文化於一爐。</p>
<p>國際大學有着相當龐大的組織，它已經設立了的部門，可分下列數種：</p>
<p>（一）中學部，分為商初二級。</p>
<p>（二）大學部，分上下二期，限四年修畢。</p>
<p>（三）研究際，所設課程，有哲學·文學·藝術·梵文學等，以及其他各國文學。</p>
<p>此外設有女子學院和賓業院，內有本工·種植·織工·和飼養等學科。</p>
<p>至於教授方面，除少數歐美人和印度本國著名的學者外，其中尚有一位遠離　國的懷抱，而至遠遠的異國—印度，努力於中印文化的溝通工作者　雲山先生。他現在就是中國學院的院長。但中國學生在那裏求學的並不多。校舍建築，只藝術院和圖書館，尚合現時代化，其餘都是竹籬茅舍。學生們時常很自由地在室外上課，浸沉在大自然中，過着恬然淡泊的的生活。</p>
<p>我們回溯已往的歷史，印度佛敎的經典和文學，給予我們中國的影響很大，不但在宗敎上，就是在文化上，也有着深切的關係存在。我們希望國際大学再能將中印文化來一次大交流！</p>

<h3>勸告商民　崇尙道德</h3>
<p>自本市物價飛騰，影響人民生計後，蔣主席關懷民間疾苦，前曾特電本市地方協會會長杜月笙氏，請聯合各界素負人望人士，發抒正論，共　平抑辦法。本市工商界，聞悉此訊，莫不仰體主席德意，力謀物價之平抑，以致連日投機活動，已漸歛跡，日用品價格，亦陸續跌價百分之五　百分之三十不等，具徵本市市民擁護最高領袖之眞誠熱烈。惟尚有若十不肖商民，不識大體，對於盟軍採購物品，及下顧酒樓飯店娛樂塲所時，故　高價，圖牟非分利潤，致引起盟軍當局不滿，</p>
<p>杜月笙談</p>
<p>杜會長鑒於此種情事，殊屬不當，昨時對記者發表談話略謂：此次來滬盟邦軍民，均係與我比肩作戰，同舟共濟之患難朋友，當其下顧酒樓飯店娛樂塲所及採購日用所需，理應貨眞價實，格外克已，用以表示優待盟友，且可藉此樹立信用，發展國際貿易，如竟有人不明大義，貪圖近利，盟邦人士，頓生不良影像，實爲市民全體之着。所望輿論界口誅筆伐，不稍寬假，工商百業，尤當相互督勸，仰體主席保護友邦人士，及優待盟軍之旨，遵照錢市長之勸告，　尙商業道德，重振善良風氣。地方協會願與輿論界共負倡導正義之使命。</p>
<p>王曉籟談</p>
<p>上海市商會理事長王曉賴昨亦發表談話略謂：信義通商原爲我國固有之佳譽，必須努力保持，何况對於駢肩作戰之盟邦將士，應如何以眞切之友誼，予以特別之優待與引導，方能表現同胞之誠信，直接保持商譽，間接即所以增進國家之地位，凡屬地方市民商界同仁均應注意及此。</p>

<h3>中宣部許副部長　報告政府新設施　潘公展等盼報界發揮權威</h3>
<p>中宣部副部長許孝炎於昨日下午三時假康樂酒家招待本市新聞界，舉行茶會。到潘公展·胡樸安·程滄波·馮有眞·陳訓　·詹文滸·馬星野·暨各報社記者七十餘人。</p>
<p>慰問報界同仁</p>
<p>首由許氏起立致辭，略謂：七八年來，中央對上海新聞界非常關懷，本人此次自渝來滬之主要目的，亦即代表中央向在上海艱苦奮鬥之新聞界同仁致最大敬意及慰問之忱。其次若干年來上海新聞界同仁及在東南區戰地服務之同仁，對後方情形容或有許多不明瞭之處，今日假此機會，向收復區同業作一簡略報告，關於後方一般情形，現政府所最注意者有兩點；</p>
<p>減輕人民負担</p>
<p>其一，努力减輕人民負担，俾全國人民於八年抗戰之後，得有休養生息之機會，如（一）停止徵兵。（二）裁减賦稅。（三）整編軍隊，將原有三百多師，縮編爲二百餘師，减少國家支出，亦即减少人民負担。（四）戰時消費稅，原爲政府當時不得已之措施，故於戰爭結束前，政府即巳明令廢止。（五）簡化稅收稽徵手續，便利人民。（六）撤廢交通管制，以便利行旅商運。凡以上所述，政府均在盡力做去，在抗戰八年中，收復區內所受之痛苦，較後方更甚，故政府不顧一切財政上之困難，將田賦豁免一年，不但如此，政府爲顧念佃農及貧農之痛苦，並實行二五减租，將佃戶對地主繳納之地租减少四分之一，希望輿論界協助政府推動此新舉措，使每一人民均能瞭解。</p>
<p>力求社會安定</p>
<p>其二，力求社會安定，如穩定金融，政府已盡極大努力，同時對生產工業方面，政府亦盡力協助，政府於兩三月內，對後方工廠貸金五十餘億元，極力使社會安定。目前政府最感困難者，爲內政問題，亦即爲共黨問題，中央始終希望此問題能循政治途徑解決，但最近共黨在華北拆鐵路，阻交通，阻撓國軍受降，並提出所謂「解放區」問題，致使問題解決之困難更多，然中央仍希望共黨問題能由政治方式解決。</p>
<p>潘主委等致詞</p>
<p>潘公展，程滄波，桂中樞，李子寬，袁業裕，彭樂善，李秋生，金茜蒂等亦相繼起立致辭，潘氏希望用與論力量來解決共黨問題，將事實告訴大衆，新聞界當站在大公無私的立塲上作嚴正批判，並問老百姓「共軍阻碍交通是否應當」，「東九省應否由國軍開往接收」，新聞界可測騐民意，以明瞭眞正老有姓看出來的是與非。程氏略謂：上海人民現最關心的是兩個問題：（一）對於若干不稱職的接收人員，痛心疾首，輿論界當盡量將這種黑暗暴露出來，使接收人員有所警惕，而政府亦得隨時注意懲處，（二）對共軍破壞交通，國軍不能執行接收任務等情形，上海人民深感頭痛，但對政府立塲，始終一致擁護，桂中樞氏報告國外人士對中國內政時有不正確見解，希望新聞界糾正。李子竟希望中央能撤銷上海新聞檢查制度，以實現言論自由。袁彭李諸氏均希望中央能儘量供給關於重要時事之消息，旋許副部長，對各人所提意見，逐項予以答復。至五時半，茶會始在極度融洽之空氣中圓滿結束。</p>
<p>又許副部長應上海特別市黨部及靑年團上海支團部邀請，於昨日上午十一時，在市黨部舉行座談會，市黨部執委，及靑年團支團部幹事等，全體參加，許氏對今後宣傳方針多所指示。</p>

<h3>外滙自由買賣聲中　金市昨又形活躍</h3>
<p>結果較前回好三萬七　公債美鈔均連帶報漲</p>
<p>昨（廿七日）因蔣主席演詞，對外匯掛牌未提隻字，空方咸感失望，同時報載政府今後對國外匯兌，採取自由賣買政策，人心反動，轉趨激昂，開盤時即喊七八萬買進，未幾即穿出八十萬大關，是時空方困獸尚門，買氣又被壓制，盤跌至七十八萬，此後美鈔屹立不動，北帮有所抵進，金價遂告站住，無如美鈔愈盤愈萬，套頭活動，金市遂呈供少求多之勢，迨空方發動補空，午刻遂急切重振，漲到八二萬以上，最後復趨盤旋，結果較前日又復回好三萬七，銀樓飾金亦昇爲八萬七，紋銀仍掛每兩兌出六百五，銀元初時徘徊於四百三左右，最後以零星客帮收購，賣價微俏，升爲四四五元</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>因政府此後對外匯取自由賣買政策，紗廠帮頗有結進，市氣陡俏，自一三一〇元步漲至一三七五元，最後約一三五〇元，較前收漲起五十元，港幣則隨金市而稍穩，無甚特殊刺激，澳鎊三千三左右，羅比三百元至三百三十元。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>繼續曹買氣所包四，業外人亦頻來吸收，大戶推波逐浪，丙種竟穿出四百元大關，結果各債較前收再漲五十元至六十五元不等，劇漲後謹防業中人佔先獲利了結。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>塲外賣買仍未暢達，金市重振，散戶辦資略來點綴，以致巨型股微穩，小股票則均好起一成左右。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>交易由疲轉穩，亦受金債所影響，最後頗多買戶，結果怡和紗廠自一千四百元內回昇至一千五百元左右，較前日各股均略回好。</p>
<p>暗拆以投機家重起活躍，需要漸殷，平靜多日後，昨稍見俏，大致自一角三分至一角六分不等</p>
<p>米市來源湧旺</p>
<p>昨日米市因各路到源湧旺，又有洋米將到之說，故人心不振，價小三四百元，中次則小六七百元，白元陰元亦隨之跟小五六百元，麵粉消胃仍懈，續疲近百元，油市以甬帮問津尚殷，價疲而復振，回升一二千元，黃豆以汕餅走化轉活，故廠方及零化當可價格回漲二三百元，生仁無榮無辱，士酒以蘇北到貨接續，消化呆滯，形勢下游，黃酒囤戶出籠，新貨應市，人心軟化。</p>
<p>紗銷頗不寂寞</p>
<p>紗市隨金價而回漲，人心轉定，內地及京滬綫客銷開展，交易頗不寂寞，然以廿支爲目標，致廿支價升起二萬上下，十六支去胃呆滯，價與上日相仿。</p>
<p>煤炭交交易清稀</p>
<p>煤市仍在沉靜狀態中，賣戶不易脫手，致交易轉淸，但脚地尙穩，柴板滬杭路（海寗硤石長安臨平）到貨續增，價見下挫，惟栗朵內地工廠用以代用煤觔，價最堅穩，炭近日到貨較少，微露俏　。</p>
<p>五金成交甚少</p>
<p>昨日五金局勢依然在停滯之中，　無起色，囤戶尙在出籠，而受主絕無僅有，加以殺價甚厲，因此但有問價之聲，而無成交之實。</p>
<h3>工商業登記　罰則甚嚴</h3>
<p>本報特訊，本市工商業登記，即日將由社會局公告辦理，聞其辦法，係採分區制，第十期之區域，定爲西　路以東，南京路以北，蘇州河以南，東至外　爲止，不論獨資或合夥之工商業，亦不論從前曾否登記，必須　照限期，依法登記，此次登記，含有强制性質，與戰前所辦者不同，如果違抗，照章要受到停業或萬元以下罰金之處分云。</p>
<h3>火腿醃臘　同業求批配</h3>
<p>敵僞時期，本埠火腿醃臘業之存貨，被敵軍抑勒收去者，爲數不少，近由該業公曾呈請當局，要求從速啓封，以平價批配同業發售，以應市面。</p>
<h3>帳面資本金額之整理</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>（續十一月二十六日稿）</p>
<p>貨幣購買減退</p>
<p>資本　主科目之有此，並不爲過，凡稍知市塲情形者，當不以吾言爲有所偏袒也，其純資產底子之不及法幣資本金額者，當然酌量予以折減，務使產不虛抬，資不落空，然後一般會計。乃得普遍整理，其有未分配盈餘性質之秘密公積金者，應儘先作為資本金額之移補額，如移補後而秘密公積仍有餘存，或其他資產須提升估價者，應另以增資手續辦理之，決不可與此項之整理帳面資本金額，混爲一談，且推而言之，資本主科目下之盈餘，應以『實現利益』爲原則，此在所得稅法規上亦有明文規定，今以貨幣購買力之減退，各種資產之時値往往遠越原價，然在會計學上在其變買而得實現利益以前，不許估價抬升，因此，在整理帳面資本金額時，如有秘密公積足資移補則最妥，吾則將資產升値以移補，應極端愼重，儘量避免預抬存貨之帳面金額，以免掩匿將來之銷貨收益，妨害正當稅收，及勞工之正當分紅，惟固定資產之升値，原與營業收益不同，以之移補資本之帳面金額，尙屬可行耳，在此種情形之下，眞所謂</p>
<p>各家情形不同</p>
<p>其資本之原爲法幣，中經僞令以二作一合爲僞劵者，當然直捷回復爲法幣原額，其原爲法幣，中經以僞劵增資者，祇須純資產情形尚佳，亦可平掉爲法幣金額，若資本全係收僞幣者，當然對於其純資產之情形，更須注意，然其時値如屬良好，則平掉之法，亦非不可行，即有不足，儘可酌量核減也，此種換算，純資產並不必十分詳細估計，祇求其仍能保持相當之底子可矣，當此政府力謀復興產業平定物價之際，底子之必須有相當的保留，乃於公於私，兩有裨益之事，若照一部份人士所稱資本須以二百作一換算其因此換算而生之假盈餘，如依法納稅，照習慣分紅，豈非將各家底子剷除過半乎，年來企業家之虛有其名，而實際投機暴利者，固屬有之，而大部份統係忍氣吞聲，在苦中掙扎，徒以僞劵之跌價，有此假盈餘，如以貨幣購買力之還元估計算之，損失何堪言喻，吾人能忍　其再受不合理之摧殘耶，或謂僞幣不値錢，此說在現在言之，果矣，五千元一萬元之僞劵，越碰越多，用無可用，豈但二百作一，即再打折頭，正當工商業孰願收之，又孰願寳之，然吾人在上海飽嘗辛艱，當不忘</p>
<p>貨幣乃媒介品</p>
<p>民生不能停，交易不能止，媒介者易中之具也，在藉此易中之時，固家家缺不了牠，此在僞令民間法幣須以二作一掉換僞劵之時，無論矣，即在此之後，有心之企業家或以物資內移，以充大後方之接濟，或將資金內移，以謀在內地另作基礎，則　幣與法幣之實際匯率，去夏尙爲平掉，今春爲十作一，及敵人屈膝，上海光復，亦僅八九十元作一，並未如今日之甚也，人若以現在僞幣劵之不値錢，而推論從前資本主所投資之偽券亦不妨多打點折頭，當非平允之論，蓋資本金經以僞券收入後，此交易之媒介品，早已與此投資手續脫離，吾人認現在所流通之僞劵爲不合法不肩顧，則可矣，若謂資本之係收僞幣者，亦爲不合法，不屑顧，寗得事理之平，因此，愚敢向各方鄭重提明，帳面資本金額之整理，不可與僞劵之整理混爲一談也。（未完）</p>

<h3>原子彈的問題</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>據美聯社從洛杉磯發來的電訊，報告一位參加製造原子彈的貝爾博士所說的話，他說用鐠來代替鈾作製造原子彈的原料之後，使製造原子彈的成本減低，時間縮短。同時警告說，像葡萄牙那樣的小國，可以把原子彈藏在美國洛杉機的倉庫裏，使美國來不及抵抗，已經把倉庫已給滅了。他又說，敵人可以把一顆原子彈放在海中，造成巨浪，而燬滅華盛頓。</p>
<p>從這一段電訊看來，可知原子彈的進步，一日千里，其可怕的程度，也一天比一天厲害了。</p>
<p>人類製造了原子彈，然而人類能不能控制原子彈呢？在這方面，我們以爲各國的政府對於未來的世界，必須先有一個一致的目標，才辦得到。大家一致爲一個更美好的大同的世界而努力，就不至於互相猜忌，也就無所謂原子彈的問題了。</p>
<h3>讓超人來管制原子彈</h3>
<p>— 余範</p>
<p>據最近的合衆社電訊，有一個不具名的美國人建議，用優生學與試騐管的方法來創造一種「聯合國超人」，作爲原子彈的保護人。</p>
<p>這個提議似乎有些怪誕不經，但是為尊重建議者的意見，也終於提交杜魯門總統，與若干議員及專家審閱中。</p>
<p>建議的本旨是產生最優秀最良善的人種，而把原子彈讓這些超人來全權管制，以達到爲全人類謀福利的目的，庶免爲歹徒作錯誤的利用。</p>
<p>要產生超人，這個建議者主張，先請優生學專家在聯合國中選擇出一批最智慧最優秀的男子作爲超人的父親。同樣也選出一批遣傳上，健康上，敎育上，事業上都有最高優生價値的女子作爲超人的母親。</p>
<p>『超男』與『超女』可以自由結合爲夫妻。倘若『超男』屬於一國家而『超女』屬於另一個國家，那麽所生的子女在聯合國組織中代表兩個國家，但是他或她僅向聯合國貢獻子女的義務。</p>
<p>『超人』在幼年時所受的敎育須在全世界最高學府中得之，每一年在一個國家的學校，他所受的是世界的敎育。</p>
<p>建議者並主張『超人』在幼年時須隨着母親們一同旅行，周遊列國，讀書求學，但是必須是母親可充任斯職，倘若母親不能同行，應另組織『婦女團』，可以教會中的修道女代勞。</p>
<p>他並主張，母親們不稱『密絲』，應另以『職銜』稱呼之。</p>
<p>至於在超人尙未產生之前，他主張把這一羣超男超女的集團稱爲『原子彈保護人養成所』，而在超人尙未長成至有實行職務能力之年齡之前，這一羣超男女對原子彈的管制問題無權可以過問。</p>
<h3>宵禁</h3>
<p>— 夜遊神</p>
<p>老沈臨走時；忽忽的對我說，「怎麽還不走？十二點就戒嚴，派司現在又不曾弄好。」我不曾注意，我前兩天回去時都在十二點半，路上的　士經我解說後，也並不曾留難。</p>
<p>我出報館才十二點，三輪車夫踏的飛快，路上很冷淸，不時有醉了的美國水兵馳過，口裏還在呼着。我的車一路沒遇到阻攔，再一轉灣就到了，就在轉灣地方，被查夜的攔住。</p>
<p>查夜的是一個着中山服的和兩名警士。這次我用前兩天的話解釋，無用；用更動聽的話解釋，也無用。他定要我們（此外另有三個人也微挽留住）去行裏『說一聲，』不得已，大家一齊往附近的警察局去，車夫推着車後面攅擁着。</p>
<p>警察局比舞廳熱閙，又像剛散塲的戲院，空塲上停滿了三輪車。審問室門口擠滿了車夫。一進裏面，擠滿了人，也都是車夫。奉行宵禁的手續也便當，每人交出居住證，警士抄下他的姓名性別，年齡住址。沒有居住證的就口頭上講一遍給記下，記完便退出去，站在廊下，車夫走完，房內祇剩下了六個干犯宵禁者。</p>
<p>一個是俄國舞女，長的很美，看樣子也很有機智，她開始時用着惱的樣子吵，『怎麽，你們預備將我拘在此地嗎？你們闖下大禍啦！你們懊悔也來不及了！我是美國人，我是一名GI!』</p>
<p>她口才眞好，使我立刻想起袁牧之的『女人和狗』來，但口才好也無用，警士看見她化裝的跳舞衣服，長統小皮鞋，不倫不類的，定是舞女，舞女一定不是美國人，不是美國人還有甚說的。</p>
<p>警士總算答應了她的要求，讓她同另一個華僑模樣女郎一齊坐在一間鐵籠的小室內，類似華僑的女郎始終不曾開口，拿出兩本電影雜誌，兩人靜悄悄的看起來。</p>
<p>舞女問完，走過一個男子，約莫三十來歲，西裝很瀟洒，扶着一個女郎，紅旗袍，短黑大衣，面貌很美，樣子顯然是醉了，脚步跌撞着，一轉身把臉湊近牆，低聲哭起來。『怎麽，軍事委員會也不成？要不，你打個電話去國際飯店？要不把我扣下，讓這位小姐出去，你把我同她都拘在這兒一夜，到明兒對這位小姐可不便當。』男子顯然爲了女郎的身份關係煩急起來，他漲紅了臉，氣的直拍那欄干。</p>
<p>可是對面那位科長祇給他一串的搖頭，『不成，不成。』男子經過數番　扎，也祇好罷了。把女郎攙進去坐下，一個警士很識趣，把自己的座椅讓出來，靠在女郎一齊，男子坐下來，兩人都閉上眼睛休息。</p>
<p>此時我一回頭，見局長正在和另一個犯夜的在辯論，局長絮絮叨叨不知說些甚麽。這人急得滿身直摸索。『諾，諾，這是我機關的身份證。』局長說，『不放的，不成的，這是十二號以前的，以前的，以前的是非法的，非法的是不承認的。』『諾，諾，十二號以後的也有，』公務員在裏面口袋內又掏出一張來。局長整整看了五分鐘。『不成，不成，這印打的不正式，我好像沒有看過這種印？』他仰起頭思索起來，一想又是半天。『要不，你打個電話給你的機關，派個人來證明一下？』那人說他情願坐到六點鐘走，派人來證明，兩天弄不完，起碼在警察局坐三天。</p>
<p>最後輪到我了，我有一篇大道理要說，現在不知道那兒去了。從局長科長的話中，我已看出宵禁的意義重大，有力的出力，無力的凑數，不然怎麽呌軍民合作呢？我不曾說甚麽，安心的等六點鐘回家。</p>
<p>『所以大家要明白宵禁的意義，宵禁的意思，』局長見一班人都安置好後，來幾句訓話。『今天又發生搶案，衣服剝光，爲你的生命着想。』我聽了也覺毛骨悚然，但一想到自己在警察局內，心內又安定了，局長見時間不早，自去安憇。</p>
<p>局長一走，警士也去睡了。房內剩下六個人，我在醉酒的女郎旁邊一隻空椅上坐下。夜裏很沈靜，偶爾聰到街上汽車馳過，看窗外對街的霓虹燈還亮着，倦意使人有些模糊，見俄國舞女披散了髮，已經睡熟，很像外國的落難小姐，廊上偶爾閃着車夫的影子，我想到剛才局長的話，便想起梁山泊好漢刦法塲，白龍廟英雄小聚義那一回來。我翻開時代雜誌看着，一篇，兩篇，我聽見鼾聲，回顯看時，祇見醉酒的女郎同那男子貼着臉靠緊着睡了，男的一定不曾睡着，他一隻手還在輕輕的撫摩那女郎的手。我感到自己身上寒冷起來。</p>
<p>抬頭一看鐘，才四點半，但遠處轉來破曉的鷄聲，糞夫喊呌聲音。警士出來了，呌大家起來好出去了，於是喊着名發居住　，我出來已四時三刻。</p>
<p>我走出警察局回家，月亮還照在天空中，經過冷僻的街道，覺得有些害怕，但是一想到現在宵禁巳解除，我放心了。</p>
<h3>値得注意</h3>
<p>據美聯社報告，印着朝陽和行着敬禮的自殺飛機師的郵票，仍在日本全國通用着。這件事情初看雖小，然而對於日本民心，可能偸偸地產生可怕的副作用。我們希望盟軍當局，密切注意這件雖小實大的事，同時也請注意日本國內其他類似的事。</p>

<h3>信念</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>我們不論做被麼事情，不論這事情是怎樣的困難，總得有一個信念；有了信念，就甚麽事情都可以做，任何困難都可以迎刃而解。</p>
<p>歐戰初期，在協約國放棄挪威南部的時光，德國的閃電戰十分得手，銳不可當，眼見得協約國的兵力是擋不住了。有一夜，英國作家雷士登氏，在福利街上向一個賣報的老人買了一份報，信口問那老人道：『今晚的消息如何？』那老人回答道：『我不知道，先生。我雖在賣報，却並不讀報；但我有一個堅定的信念，相信我們終於會獲得最後勝利的。」</p>
<p>我國之得最後勝利，雖有許多因素；而最大因素，實在由於最高當局之信念，他相信日寇定會屈服，我國定獲勝利，因於信念之堅定，國策也就始終不會動搖，而最後的勝利便屬於我們了。</p>
<p>青年人在做每一件事情之先，不管它怎樣困難，總得堅定的信念，沒有信念，無事可爲，有了信念，無事不可爲。</p>
<h3>問號</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>行政院翁副院長文灝在北平談及收復區的種種不良現象，感慨萬端，說許多事情壞到使人不敢相信的程度。並說『本人官可以不做，這許多壞事必加追究。』</p>
<p>我們相信翁副院長這些話是可以兌現的。</p>
<p>但是同時我們看一部份官吏做事的態度，恐均與翁副院長的略有不同。他們好像在說：『本人官安可不做？這許多壞事何必加以追究？』</p>
<p>話是一樣的，祇是加了一個問號。</p>
<h3>淚</h3>
<p>— 慕容妍</p>
<p>我想像我是坐在大歌劇院的華麗的包廂內，廣園的穹頂下。我的旁邊是沙藍。院內靜寂得如沒有一個生靈，除去舞合上的唱歌和音樂。觀衆座里的黯淡情景把舞台上的動作襯得更光亮了。舞台上的燈光映照着沙藍的白晰的臉如靜靜的石膏像，有時那上面掠過一絲愉快的微笑。</p>
<p>不過我却是在一間舒適的起坐室里看見沙藍的不樂的臉。</p>
<p>『我不去了，』她說。三天前我曾約她在這一下午去看一齣狀劇，戲的人生。</p>
<p>她的拒絕是沒有理由的。可是她拒絕了。</p>
<p>『爲什麽呢？』</p>
<p>不答。</p>
<p>『爲什麽呢？』</p>
<p>這是一種感情的作弄。她流淚了，完全沒有理由的。</p>
<p>我看她的淚珠從眼眶里翻下來。我輕輕地安慰她，沒有原因的。然後我用手帕揩她潤濕的眼睛。</p>
<p>以後是她笑了，也是沒有原因，沒有理由的。</p>
<p>有些淚是完全不必要的。</p>
<h3>吳群之筆</h3>
<p>— 可口</p>
<p>報載舊金山廣東省銀行行長吳君，於四年前珍珠港事變後把自來水筆當臨別紀念禮物，送給美國太平洋艦隊司令尼米茲，呌他用這枝筆去簽日本的降書。日本投降後，尼米茲果然照辦。最近尼米茲回美，把那枝價値速城的筆送還給吳君，以留紀念。</p>
<p>這雖是珍聞逸事之類的事情，但是這位吳先生的信念與眼光，却是値得我們敬佩的！</p>

<h3>敵人　（The　Enemy）　（七）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺</p>
<p>在道樣一種優越感之下，她不加思慮地俯身下去，將那白種人身上僅足蔽體的破爛衣服解開。她解開了他的胸前以後，就將那塊弓子拿進來的淸潔的小毛巾浸在熱水裏面，小心地替他洗臉。這人的皮膚雖然已給風吹日曬得十分組糙，却也肌理細膩，他小時候皮膚一定是很白的。</p>
<p>現在這人已不是個孩子了，所以她也並不因此就比起初時歡喜他一點，可是這樣想着想着，她也就將這人的上身都洗乾凈了。可是她不敢將他翻過身來。貞雄那裘去了？怒氣旣消，她又焦急起來，就將手在那絞起來的毛巾上揩乾。又怕那人受了凉，她又將棉被給他蓋好。</p>
<p>她低聲喊道：『貞雄！』</p>
<p>在她喊時，他恰巧預備進來。他的手已經按在門上了，現在就推門進來。她看見他拿着外科出診包，已經將手術衣穿好。</p>
<p>她呌道：『你決定要給他開刀了嗎？』</p>
<p>他簡短地說：『是的。』就將背朝她，抖開一條已消過毒的毛巾，舖在房中較高處的地上，再將他的手術儀器拿出來放在上面。</p>
<p>他說：『拿毛巾來。』</p>
<p>她順從而又焦急地走到架子旁邊取下毛巾。應該再拿幾張舊草薦，免得地上精緻的地毯給血弄髒了。她走到後面洋臺上去，將園丁放在那裏，預備在寒冷的夜裏保護嬌嫩的灌木的草薦捧了一把進來。</p>
<p>等她回進房裏，她才看見這已經沒有用了。鮮血已經滲透了那人傷處的包紮，弄髒了他身下的蓆子。</p>
<p>她呌道：『啊，那蓆子！』</p>
<p>『是的，已經弄髒了。』貞雄好像一點不介意地答道。他命令她道：『幫我將他翻過身來。』</p>
<p>她一聲不響地依他做了，他就小心地替這人洗起背來。</p>
<p>她說：『弓子不肯替他洗。』</p>
<p>『那麽你替他洗了嗎？』貞雄問，却不曾將他簡截迅速的動作稍停一下。</p>
<p>她說：『是的。』</p>
<p>他好像沒有聽見一樣。她也早看慣了他這種專心致志於工作中的樣子。她有一點想知道他開刀開得如此神妙，不知可注意他所開的是什麽。</p>
<p>他說：『在他需要時，你得給他上麻醉藥。』</p>
<p>『我嗎？我從來沒有做過這樣的事，』她茫然答道。</p>
<p>他不耐煩地說：『容易得很。』</p>
<p>他現在是在將包紥取下，血就流得更快。他用頭上的那盞明亮的外科醫生的燈照着張望那個傷口。他冷靜而又有興趣的說：『子彈還在裏面，不知岩石的傷有多深。如果不太深的話，也許我可以取出那顆子彈。可是這流血不僅是表面上的。他已失了很多血了。』</p>
<p>說到這裏，花子哽噎起來。他抬頭一看，見她的臉色已經蠟黃了。</p>
<p>『不要暈倒，』他冷酷地說。他不曾放下他正在進行的工具。『如果我現在停了下來，這人必死無疑。』她將手按住自己的嘴，跳起來跑出了這間房間。他聽見她在花園裏乾嘔。可是他還是繼續工作着。</p>
<h3>社會服務　民意何處申訴？</h3>
<p>— 不平鳴</p>
<p>抱怨無處伸最感苦悶　政治不澈底有失民心</p>
<p>編者先生：連日拜讀大著，具見尊重民意，爲民服務的精神，躍於紙上，深為欽敬！報章爲民衆喉舌，發揚民意的公器，然而民間一片哀怨聲，向何處申訴？抗戰勝利後，「言論自由」不是中央已經規定了麽？但能有幾家報紙肯切實爲民衆說話，足以代表興論呢？希望貴報眞能名符其實的負起這重大的使命，民衆常然會竭誠擁護貴報的立塲，我這裏約略貢獻幾點意見，請給我發表的機會。</p>
<p>（一）懲治漢奸要澈底　懲治漢奸的條例，早已公怖了，報上也見到開始審理的消息，而第一第二號漢奸，都是地位很低的人，爲什麽不把特任簡任及通敵著稱的人先辦呢？報上又說上海被捕四百餘人，而解送法院的只三十餘人，其餘的人爲何延不解案呢？傳說有的准予保釋，其中蛛絲馬跡，小民莫明其妙，應請負責當局明白公佈。</p>
<p>（二）平賣不是好辦法　前幾天看見報上說有大宗棉布由封閉的會庫取出，交四大公司平賣，又有白糖大批，在外灘拍賣，這兩個辦法，小民不無疑問。因爲買到的人，實在太少，若以上海五百萬市民而言，不知佔得實惠的是千分還是萬分之一。照我想「配給制度」要比平賣好得多，生活必需品嚴格配拾，眞是最公平的辦法，大可採用。</p>
<p>（三）特殊階級的馬路　南京路是上海最繁盛之街，而今已成爲特殊階級所獨享的馬路，未免太武斷，太不合理了。只准汽車往來，三輪車黃包車不准通過，不但市面受打擊，老幼的人都無法通過了。我有兩位七十餘歲的祖父母，因年邁力實，幾次想到南京路去，而終於無法行走，十歲以下兒童，也無法接近。其實車馬儘管擁擠，只要多派交通警察來維持，正可不必限制人力車輛。何况九江漢口兩路，已決定單程交通，爲何南京路不恢復原狀呢？（下略）</p>
<p>編者按：不平鳴君所表示的意見，我甚爲贊同，報道新聞，發揚民意，是我們的天職，當然努力做去，決不推諉。現社會確有許多不合理的事，需要民衆去督促，使負責當局有所警惕。現在是民主的時代，任何政事應該以民爲主，誰也無法阻授。我主張社會上所有「民隱」與「民怨」，要是悶在肚裏，不宣不洩，或是竊竊私議，暗中猜忌，這都是不是辦法，應該有大無畏的精神，光明正直的態度，發爲正論，用文字表達出來，直寄本欄，自當優先發表，公諸大衆，給負責常局，作爲參考的資料，這是一樁絕好的事，不知讀者以爲然否？</p>
<h3>闢滬海航綫　籲請招商局辦理</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>近來報載沿海沿江航線，陸續開班，又說招商局接收敵僞輪船。爲數不少，那末所有航線，未通的港口，應該迅速復航，以便商旅。筆者世居海門，不時往來於滬海之間，看到數年來帆船交通，種種痛苦情形，眞是一言難盡，例如：（一）船小人擠，無蓬蓋設備，暑天雨天，旅客易致疾病；（二）船行江心，靜風則停，海盜趕來搶刧，慘不忍聞；（三）疾風遽起，時有傾覆可能，生命堪虞。綜上所述，決非虛說，筆者敬代海門啓東兩縣民衆，請求招商局迅即調撥千噸左右輪船兩艘，每日對開海啓各港，不但旅客安全往來，即兩縣主要豐產，如棉花，土布，雜糧，牲畜，及土產等，可大量運滬接濟，故通航已　不容再緩。在戰前滬海線本有四輪往來，每日兩艘，向稱便利，今茲抗戰勝利，已將三月，獨此線迄未復航，民衆望眼欲穿，籲請招商局迅速籌劃，於短時期內復航，以慰衆望。</p>
<p>編渚按：海客君代海啓兩縣民衆請求復航，理由充分，確爲當今急務，盼望招商局迅即籌備並將辦理情形，賜示一二，本　業予發表，以慰衆望。</p>
<h3>服務簡報</h3>
<p>崑山讀者問：九月上句報載「淪陷區賣買土地一概無效」未識可否原價贖回？敬希在貴欄詳告為感。（按）在淪陷期間被敵僞非法强佔，或利用敵僞勢力强迫成交者，可照原價贖還。詳見上海市地政局所頒法令。</p>

<h3>National Army Continues Advance Towards Shenyang, Right Flank Turns East Towards Yingkou</h3>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 27th] Reports state that the National Army advancing along the Beining Railway continued its advance today, moving 120 li from Jinzhou, reaching Goubangzi, less than 270 li from Shenyang. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Soviet Union has agreed to hand over defense of the Northeast to the National Army, but the withdrawal date of the Soviet troops will be delayed until January of next year. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has taken responsibility for guaranteeing the safety of National Army troops airlifted to Fuyu or Changchun, where Communist forces are currently very active. It is said that the Soviet concession is due to improved relations between the two countries, and unconfirmed reports state that the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to adhere to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Chinese officials continue to state that many lower-level officials returning from Guannei to Changchun to take over the Northeast. Jiang Jingguo, the special commissioner of the Northeast will also promptly return to Changchun to negotiate with the Soviet side regarding the airlift of National Army troops to the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] According to sources here today, the Central Army advancing along the Beining Railway towards Shenyang is currently facing resistance from the puppet Manchukuo army under Bao Wen-yue and various other units. Bao is the Chief of the General Staff of the Nanjing puppet military council. One month before the Japanese surrender, Bao was appointed as the chairman of the puppet Henan provincial government by Chen Gongbo. After Tokyo accepted the Potsdam Declaration, Bao rushed to the Northeast to gather the remnants of the Manchukuo army. Several old warlords of Manchuria have colluded with him, chanting "Manchuria for Manchurians," preventing the National Army from entering the nine eastern provinces, attempting to evade the crime of collaboration, and to maintain their military power in their former provinces. Jinzhou, a key point held by the Communist forces, was previously reported to have been garrisoned by the 2nd Armored Division of the Eighth Route Army under Zhu De, but after three hours of fighting, it was captured by the National Army. As the main force of the National Army rapidly advanced to Goubangzi, its right flank turned east to advance towards Yingkou. After the National Army occupies this Yellow Sea port, it will gain another landing point for maritime reinforcements. Yingkou is also a railway hub.</p>
<h3>National Army Around Beiping Approaches Key Passes of the Great Wall</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] It is rumored that General Malinovsky has proposed to postpone the Soviet troop withdrawal date to January 3rd of next year in order to assist the National Army in taking over the areas occupied by the Soviet troops. It is also learned that the troops under Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security Command, seemed to be clearing out Communist forces around Jinzhou and Huludao today in preparation for an attack on Shenyang. It is rumored that there are only a few thousand Communist troops in Shenyang.</p>
<p>Responsible parties stated that Malinovsky did not provide assistance to the National Army in peacefully taking over the areas occupied by the Communist army. The National Army is currently strengthening its position in the southern part of the Nine Eastern Provinces, and it is reported that Huludao will soon replace Qinhuangdao as the main stronghold of the National Army. The National Army around Beiping is advancing towards the Gubeikou pass of the Great Wall to the northeast, with its ultimate goal being Chengde in Rehe, in order to further occupy the Rehe plateau area and to protect the National Army's deep penetration into the southern plains of the Nine Eastern Provinces.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the Supreme Economic Council, President Song Proposes Three Principles</h3>
<p>Realizing Economic Construction Policies with a Spirit of Great Fearlessness</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] At the first meeting of the Supreme Economic Council on the 26th, President Song delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows: "Chairman, esteemed members, distinguished guests, today marks the establishment of this council. We are deeply inspired by the Chairman's presence and his insightful instructions on the direction of our policy implementation. As this council is the highest decision-making body for economic policy, it bears a very close relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihoods, and its responsibilities are truly immense. We are now facing countless difficulties, which pose tremendous obstacles to any economic construction policy. We must embrace a spirit of great fearlessness to overcome these difficulties, so that economic construction policies can be thoroughly implemented. As the Chairman indicated in his speech, when the basic conditions are suitably resolved, the prosperity of our national economy can enter a stage never before reached. As for when this stage can be reached, we must first recognize that not only must government officials work hard and the environment be improved rapidly, but also the economic plans adopted in the future must be suitable for our national conditions and not violate economic principles. Therefore, before deciding on a plan, it must be thoroughly studied. Before implementing the plan, there must be particularly careful preparation. Today, as this council is established, we should put forward a few simple and essential principles, that is, the principles that the government must adhere to when implementing economic policies, with respect to the people, the government itself, and friendly nations, as follows:"</p>
<h3>Regarding the People: Supporting Economic Activities</h3>
<p>"First, with respect to the people, the government should guide the economic endeavors of the people so that they can develop vigorously, not to control these endeavors, but to support the economic activities of the people so that they can proceed smoothly, not to interfere with these activities. However, there are considerable limits to guidance and support. It is not to say that the people can take a completely dependent attitude towards the government. Rather, in economic matters, the people must not forget the fundamental principle of 'self-reliance.' Whether it is industry, commerce, finance, or agriculture, regardless of the scale, they must use their own strength and courage to succeed. The success of all the people's endeavors, as long as they do not exceed the scope of the government's economic policies, is fulfilling a part of the responsibility to the nation, to society, and to the national economy. However, if the people do not strive forward from the starting point of 'self-help,' believing that the government can continuously sacrifice the national treasury to maintain a situation that cannot be sustained on an economic level, this is a grave error."</p>
<p>Four Important Areas</p>
<p>"As for the concrete manifestations of government guidance and support, they are not in providing funds, but in the following four important areas:</p>
<p>A. Regarding technology, the government, because of its position and its concentrated power, is more likely than the people to obtain the latest and most advanced scientific knowledge at home and abroad, and to attract first-class technical talents. In the future, appropriate institutions should be established in many ways to serve as the core for guiding agricultural, industrial, and commercial experiments and improvements.</p>
<p>B. Regarding finance, the government currently faces a pressing issue, which is how to reorganize finances and stabilize finance. Being able to solve this problem is the most fundamental assistance to the people's economy. Because prices and finance cannot be stabilized, all production enterprises will not dare to move forward boldly, and the labor problem will not be able to find a long-term solution. High interest rates cannot fall, and production is difficult to be vigorous. Therefore, the government must start by stabilizing finance to support the people's economy.</p>
<p>C. The most attention should be paid to transportation, for reasons that are very clear. Currently, the major obstacle to the recovery of agriculture, industry, and commerce is the extensive damage to transportation equipment and the obstruction of transportation in various places after the long war of resistance. The most effective way for the government to support the economic development of the people is to actively restore the main railway lines, the Yangtze River and coastal shipping lines, important inland highways, and further, to complete air transport between major cities.</p>
<p>D. Regarding power, an indispensable condition for modern production mechanization is the availability of inexpensive power. Therefore, the government should first pay attention to the production of coal and the distribution of various coal-producing areas in order to support the economic development of the people. When industrial development reaches a considerable stage in the future, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River can reach a level suitable for economic conditions, the government should not hesitate to invest huge capital to develop large-scale hydropower generation projects, and should first make various technical preparations. The above four items are only examples of the most important principles of the government's economic policy towards the people. However, the obligations that the government should fulfill for the economic development of the people and the assistance that the people should expect from the government have been briefly outlined."</p>
<h3>Regarding the Government Itself: Balancing Economic Policies</h3>
<p>"Second, regarding the government itself, this council has the responsibility of balancing and adjusting the economic policies of various government departments. The so-called balancing refers to maintaining a balance between the government and the people in the distribution of the nation's annual production for productive enterprises. The first point is that because the annual production income of a country is limited, if the portion consumed by the government is too large, the result will naturally be that the people's productivity will be hit. Therefore, the government must limit the scope of its own expenditures to avoid over-consuming the nation's production income, so as not to lose its balance. The second point is that the enterprises operated by the government must have sufficient reasons for being state-owned. Otherwise, the result will not only increase unnecessary burdens on the national treasury, but also threaten the stability of finance, and the distribution of productive enterprises between the government and the people will also be unbalanced. The meaning of the so-called balance is not to say that the two parties should be evenly distributed, but a reasonable distribution of importance. The so-called adjustment refers to adjusting the enterprises run by various government departments if there are overlaps. If there are contradictions in the economic policies promoted by various departments, they must also be adjusted. Therefore, it has the responsibility of overall planning for the government's own expenditures and the enterprises it operates, as well as the policies it promotes."</p>
<h3>Regarding Friendly Nations: Frank, Mutually Beneficial Cooperation</h3>
<p>"Third, regarding friendly nations, the government should take cooperation as the premise in its economic relations with various friendly nations. The approach should be absolutely frank and mutually beneficial, and without any bias. The scope can be roughly divided into technical cooperation, cooperation in operational matters, and financial cooperation. In terms of technology, this council should lead and maintain mutually beneficial contact with countries advanced in engineering and science, so as to increase the speed of economic development for the people and various government departments. In terms of commerce, efforts should be made to achieve mutually beneficial coordination in all matters relating to international trade and international exchange. In terms of finance, efforts should be made to cooperate with friendly nations to enable capital seeking outlets on the one hand to flow in accordance with economic conditions, and on the other hand, to reasonably utilize it to increase domestic production capacity. The above three types of international economic cooperation can directly or indirectly help and advance the realization of the prosperity of our national economy. The above is a very brief outline of the goals to be pursued by this council in the future. It is hoped that under the leadership of the Chairman, we will proceed in a down-to-earth and prudent manner, and that the members will provide more assistance to the heavy and complex economic planning in the future."</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to China, Hurley, Resigns</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] US Ambassador to China Hurley has resigned. He believes that the failure of US Asian policy is due to the weakness and opposition of US diplomatic authorities.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shouxing and Hu Zhi Appointed as Members of the Jiangxi Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The National Government issued an order on the 27th: Wen Qun, member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Finance, and Hu Jiafeng, member and Secretary-General, have requested to resign. Wen Qun and Hu Jiafeng are both approved to be relieved of their respective concurrent posts. In this order, Xiong Shouxing and Hu Zhi are appointed as members of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. In this order, Xiong Shouxing is concurrently appointed as Director of the Department of Finance of the Jiangxi Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>End Date of the War of Resistance Designated as September 3rd</h3>
<p>Wartime Regulations Simultaneously Abolished</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Many of the various wartime regulations promulgated by the National Government stipulate a period of practical application, and must be abolished after the end of the war or within a certain number of days after the end of the war. Therefore, the date of the end of the war of resistance should be clearly designated as a basis. It is heard that the National Government will designate September 3rd of this year, the day the Allied nations accepted the surrender of Tokyo, as the end date of the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Political Conference to Convene on November 1st, List of Attendees Finalized</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] Zhang Qun said in a speech in Chengdu: The political conference is scheduled to open on November 1st, but based on observations here, it depends on the outcome of Zhou Enlai's return to Yan'an.

<h3>Jiang Tingfu Scheduled to Return to Chongqing Today, Relief Work Determined to be Nationalized, Relief to be Promoted in Communist Areas Alike</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and Han Leisheng, Deputy Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), jointly hosted a reception for the press in this city at the Cathay Hotel yesterday to report on their recent tour of the country and to explain the ways to promote relief and rehabilitation work. At the reception, the most noteworthy point was Jiang's clarification of the nationalization of the CRRRA's work. Jiang said, "Our work is aimed at the people of the whole country, without distinction of north, south, east, or west, and without distinction of party or religion, we treat everyone equally. The principle of relief is based on the degree of destruction and the extent of damage." Before leaving Chongqing, I discussed this point with Mr. Zhou Enlai. Mr. Zhou expressed his approval and agreed with him that if the safety of the CRRRA's staff and relief supplies could be guaranteed, relief and rehabilitation work would be promoted in the Communist areas at the same time.</p>
<p>Regarding suppressing prices, Jiang said: "One of the major goals of the CRRRA's work is to assist the government and the people in actively suppressing inflation and rising prices. A portion of the relief supplies will be sold at parity prices in various places in order to balance prices. At the same time, this method will be used to obtain funds to promote other rehabilitation construction work. The government has allocated more than 100 million yuan this year for various relief and rehabilitation expenses, and the budget for next year will be increased to 400 million yuan." Jiang is scheduled to return to Chongqing today, and Han Leisheng is also scheduled to return to the United States.</p>
<p>In answering questions from reporters, Jiang added: "At the request of Ms. Soong Ching Ling, the CRRRA has collected a large quantity of medical supplies in Chongqing and is preparing to transport them to the Communist areas by truck. I have told Ms. Soong that when the medicines are received, only a receipt from the hospital director is required, and there are no other conditions."</p>
<p>No Famine Guaranteed Within Two or Three Years</p>
<p>Regarding the future of relief and rehabilitation work, Jiang said: "In the end, we must rely on our own efforts. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, our country faced many difficulties and had limited capabilities. However, our government has made a firm determination to ensure that relief work can be effective. I can boldly guarantee three things: (1) The assistance that the United Nations will give me will be very great. (2) No famine can be guaranteed in China within two years. (3) No plague can be guaranteed in China within two or three years. I have always liked to study history. In the past, countries that had undergone great wars needed 30 to 40 years to recover. I hope that this time, with modern scientific methods and with the assistance of the Allied nations, our country can restore its original vigor that was lost in the war within four or five years."</p>
<p>Han Leisheng Reports on Work</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Before Director Jiang spoke, Han Leisheng reported, briefly stating: "(1) After arriving in China, I visited Chairman Jiang, President Song, etc., and inspected various places one after another. The impression I got was excellent. After inspecting Guilin, Liuzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Guangzhou, Hengyang, and other counties and villages, I felt that the most serious problems were: A, Lack of transportation; B, Insufficient distribution of coal for winter; C, The supply of medicines, hospitals, doctors, clothing, and food also needs to be resolved. (2) To remedy the above difficulties, the UNRRA has formulated working methods, and work is underway. For the work in China, we will try to transport relief supplies to China and help China solve post-war difficulties. There are already five ships transporting supplies to China, and nine to ten ships are on the way. On average, 30 relief ships can arrive in China every month, each with a load of 8,000 tons.</p>
<p>Transporting Goods to China and Transferring Them to the Interior</p>
<p>"How to transport the goods to China and transfer them to the interior needs to be thoroughly resolved. We will use airplanes, ships, trains, cars, etc. as transportation tools. A, In terms of ships, ships from the UK, the US, Canada, and Norway will all participate in this work in the future. Each ship carries a value of 4 million US dollars. B, In terms of vehicles, 600 transport vehicles have arrived in China, and 1,050 are on the way, and there will be more in the future. In addition, there are landing ships suitable for inland navigation. C, Railway transportation is the most problematic because the US military has no surplus materials to repair the destroyed railways, and vehicles are also in short supply. It is hoped that the Chinese government will find a solution to this matter quickly. (3) A large number of hospital supplies, cotton, and gauze will continue to be shipped, and clothes will be collected from the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, totaling 10 million pounds (each pound is worth 11 US dollars), and are already on the way to China."</p>
<p>China Must Rebuild Itself</p>
<p>Han Leisheng concluded by saying that China has suffered greatly after eight years of the War of Resistance, and that all of its difficulties must be resolved by China itself. Foreign relief is only a kind of assistance, and China's reconstruction must be achieved through China's efforts. The UNRRA's work will end in March 1947, so the responsibility of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is very heavy. He has great expectations for China's reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Special Commentary: On the So-Called Shidehara Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>Shidehara Diplomacy is an old term in international forums, also known as Shidehara Foreign Policy. From 1924 to 1931, Shidehara served as Foreign Minister in six of Japan's seven cabinets. At that time, the country's power was growing, attracting the attention of various powers. He outwardly pretended to be skilled in neighborly relations, while secretly engaging in extensive strategic maneuvering. As a son-in-law of nobility, he occupied the important post of Foreign Minister, and after much glory, sudden adversity struck. After the September 18th Incident, he judged the reckless actions of the Kwantung Army would be greatly detrimental to the country. He declared to the public, "Japan has swallowed a bomb!" As a result, he greatly offended the military clique and was sidelined for more than ten years. After the defeat, he rose again to clean up the mess, cautiously aware of the unlucky fate of Emperor Jimmu, and hesitating at the door of the Allied commander. His final years were quite pitiful. In all fairness, this was probably compelled by his patriotic heart, and not what he desired.</p>
<p>The New York Evening Post criticized Shidehara with the following points: 1. The military cliques advocated armed aggression, which was rapid, while the financial cliques advocated economic aggression, which was slow. Shidehara rode in the luxurious carriage of the financial cliques and traveled on the broad road of the military cliques. The only difference was the means and tools; the crime of aggression was the same. 2. Japanese politicians like Ozaki Saito rose to prominence by opposing aggression. The Shidehara Cabinet, nominally seeking talent from across the country, in fact excluded and ignored them. Conversely, Nonazawa, the president of the Bank of Japan who supported the military cliques during the war, was frequently consulted and relied upon as a key figure. If the root of aggression is not eradicated, how can the country's governance be good? 3. The US Secretary of State and the Army and Navy have jointly declared that Japanese Shinto should be eliminated. Shinto is the source of the Emperor's power. Shidehara, with all his might, supported the Emperor system. How can the trend of Emperor worship and aggression worship be stopped? 4. Former US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, who was known as an expert on Japan, praised Shidehara diplomacy in his book written after ten years of service in Japan, attributing it to "enlightenment." However, there is a difference between enlightenment and moderation. Shidehara was certainly moderate, but not enlightened. Moderation is not constant. Economic aggression is precisely because it is gradual, causing the invaded country to decay from within without realizing it.</p>
<p>These four points are not only the opinion of the New York Evening Post, but also the common sentiment in China's public and private discussions. I once saw a special dispatch from Tokyo in Dongzhou Jing reporting that Shidehara told reporters about his regret for the Northeast provinces, which was extremely common, but the headline claimed that Shidehara was shirking responsibility on us, and his words were mostly absurd. Absurdity is a mild term, and even his talk with reporters, though a small matter, can be used to infer the rest. I believe that the government of a defeated country is weak and easily blamed, and its efforts to seek the sympathy of the victorious countries are driven by both emotion and necessity. If they seek sympathy but are still subjected to contempt and abuse, they will be at a loss and may even resign in dismay. This can be seen from Germany after World War I. At that time, the Berlin government had no intention of planning revenge, and sought to cooperate with the Allied powers and guide its people to democracy and freedom. However, the victorious countries constantly found fault, leading the people to hate the government for selling out the country and frequently assassinating officials. Rathenau, a scholar known for his academic achievements and peaceful temperament, was in charge of foreign affairs, but his life was not safe. The cabinet rose and fell frequently, and even when it rose, it could not enjoy a peaceful night. Soon after, Hitler seized the opportunity and took control, leading Germany into Nazism as if it were nothing. The volcano of World War II was buried here! These are all things that today's politicians have seen and should serve as a clear warning.</p>
<p>Japan is an enemy country, and Shidehara is an enemy prime minister. To demand that he share the same views as us, especially when he was in power ten years ago, seems unfair. Now, at the age of seventy, he is struggling to manage a difficult situation. His spirit of compromise is perhaps most suitable at this time, just like Rathenau, the man of peace and virtue. It must be known that the Japanese people who oppose Shidehara, as seen from the declarations of Tokyo newspapers and various parties, are numerous. If the Allies give them an opportunity, these people will seize it to stab Shidehara in the chest. The collapse of his cabinet will be like crushing dry weeds and rotten wood. Whoever rises again will not be able to satisfy the wishes of the Japanese opposition. Moving forward smoothly is unlikely. If they don't return to the far right, they may move to the far left, becoming radical and reckless. This is not just a杞人忧天 (groundless fear).</p>
<p>In recent months, the theory of the balance of power in Europe has gradually emerged again. Talented people there point to the US, China, and the Soviet Union as three systems, and plan to establish a Western European alliance to resist them. As for Japan, whose diplomacy cannot be independent for some time, which system will it join to gradually assert itself? As for Japan's affairs, we Chinese should ask ourselves whether we can become a system and what preparations we should make from now on. We cannot pretend not to know. Compatriots returning from America often say that Americans no longer talk about Pearl Harbor. It is said that such sentiments are not heard among ordinary people. This shows that the Yankees are superior. Our national strength is far inferior to that of America. If our intelligence is also so far behind, what will the result be? What should we do? It is said that since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has achieved the status of a powerful country before the war through seventy years of hard work. How easy is that? Now, a single defeat has destroyed everything. The depression and agitation in their hearts are self-evident, as is the humiliation of kneeling and begging for peace from our country, whose military strength is far inferior. Japan has always considered itself the leader of East Asia and does not treat us as equals. We cannot find a favorable diplomatic path. Now that Heaven has taken their spirit and they are paying for their sins, we should use our magnanimity to act between "virtue" and "justice" to repay them. Would they agree and follow? Would that be what we desire? Whatever the results, we will not interfere with their approach. In short, for the present, we have no time to provoke them and ignite that humiliation.

<h3>Senate Launches Heated Debate on Authorizing the President</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] After the Senate began debating the authorization of Truman to dispatch US troops to join other United Nations members in sanctions against aggression, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally pointed out today that the United Nations organization is a "preventive medicine" that can be used to stop the spread of war. He also observed the turmoil in the East Indies, Iran, China, Palestine, Argentina, and Spain, viewing the United Nations organization as "the only bright spot in the sky without rain." He said, "Only by maintaining the American spirit can we best contribute to world peace. For this reason, my position has always been against a world federation that would bury America."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] US Senators Ball, Fulbright, and Taylor proposed today that the strength of the United Nations organization might be insufficient to prevent atomic bomb warfare, and that it would be more effective to organize a world government, but this was immediately refuted by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally. It is said that India has a population of 300 million, China 400 million, and the Soviet Union 175 million, far more than the United States. Once a world government is established, the United States will lag behind in population numbers. Taylor replied that he would rather be outnumbered in a world government than die in an atomic bomb attack.</p>

We could have retired to our homes, but I do not want to recount to you today what would have happened if we had retired.

<h3>List of Japanese War Criminals Has Been Sent to MacArthur - Emperor Not Included</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] A spokesman for MacArthur's chief of staff announced today that the list of Japanese war criminals submitted by the Chinese government has been delivered to MacArthur's headquarters.

<h3>Gloomy Skies and Continuous Autumn Rain - Japanese Parliament Opens Yesterday - Emperor's Rescript Proclaims Proactive Axis as Usual</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] The Japanese extraordinary parliament opened this morning in the magnificent House of Peers. Emperor Hirohito attended as usual and read the official rescript in a dull tone. Members of both houses of parliament bowed deeply and listened attentively as usual. To the right of the Emperor's seat were the royal princes and officials of the Imperial Household Ministry, and to their right was Prime Minister Shidehara. The first chapter of the rescript was about amending the current election law, which seemed to be limited to the House of Representatives. In addition, various existing laws that suppress the people must be abolished, and the distribution of large estates and the establishment of labor laws must be implemented one by one. This is unprecedented in Japanese history. Hirohito always wore a golden and brilliant military uniform for previous attendances, but today he changed to a newly made ceremonial dress with no smile on his face. In the silence of the entire assembly, he walked quickly to the throne. People inside the building had been waiting for ten minutes. Hirohito's brother, Prince Chichibu, did not attend, reportedly due to illness. Prince Takamatsu attended in a naval uniform with ribbons, and Prince Mikasa wore an army uniform. When the parliament opened today, the weather was gloomy and autumn rain was continuous. It is said that this is the usual pattern.</p>
<h3>Shidehara Cabinet Gains Breathing Room</h3>
<p>Order to Suspend Pensions Granted Extension</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] News from Japanese political circles states that the crisis faced by the Shidehara Cabinet has temporarily subsided. MacArthur originally ordered the Japanese government to immediately stop all pensions for military personnel. However, after Shidehara personally explained to MacArthur that the cabinet would face a serious crisis if the order was implemented immediately, and requested MacArthur to postpone the order until February 1 of next year, MacArthur has granted an extension. MacArthur's order will have a significantly greater impact on Japanese soldiers than previous orders. Under the pension system, retired officers of the Japanese army and navy can temporarily secure their livelihoods. If it is stopped, these soldiers will have no time or opportunity to find a way to restore their status. MacArthur's recent order to abolish all organizations of Japanese soldiers has also had a significant impact on most retired Japanese soldiers. MacArthur's policy of cracking down on wartime profiteers and military personnel who seek profit seems to be progressing well. According to Naraqiao Gu, director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, in a conversation today, he believes that the cabinet can overcome the difficult hurdle of the parliament convened today. After holding a simple opening ceremony this morning, the parliament will begin discussing various practical issues tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Small Newspaper Scheduled to Be Published Next Month</h3>

<p>Five Thousand Chinese in Surabaya Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] The Indonesian National Congress convened yesterday and resolved three matters: (1) To thank Ceylon for its sympathy; (2) To thank the Ceylonese Minister of Health for asking the Ceylonese government to actively assist Indonesia; (3) To call upon the people of Ceylon and India to provide material and spiritual assistance to the Indonesian independence movement, so that the British cannot sacrifice Indonesia to the Netherlands. The Indonesian parliament believes that Britain's actions in Indonesia are similar to Japan's creation of the Mukden Incident in 1931.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th, United Press] The Indonesian Parliament, meeting here yesterday, announced that the military conflict in Surabaya resulted in 55,000 Chinese deaths and injuries, and completely blamed Britain for the Java incident.</p>
<p>The Entirety of Java is Still in Turmoil</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] The Allied Supreme Command announced today that the entirety of Java is still in turmoil.

<h3>The Relief Administration Will Allocate 800 Million Yuan to Our Country</h3>
<p>The US Senate Passes an Appropriation for the Administration to Help Fund Its Work Next Year</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Dispatch] The US Senate Appropriations Committee today passed an appropriation of the remaining $550 million owed to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). This means that the unpaid portion of the funds originally allocated by the United States to UNRRA can be fully allocated. For China, UNRRA will be able to allocate 800 million yuan in accordance with regulations. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has also passed a $1.35 billion appropriation for UNRRA, which is the funds the United States is allocating to UNRRA to help fund its work next year. Today's news: The new proposal will be submitted for debate in the House before the Christmas recess. After the bill is passed by the House, it will be submitted to the Senate for approval, followed by the allocation of funds. Although President Truman, Director Ryman, and Marshal Eisenhower have sought the immediate allocation of funds to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Congress has not yet approved it. Congress's indecision may be due to: (1) UNRRA's poor performance; (2) A large proportion of UNRRA's relief supplies are being shipped to the Soviet-controlled Balkan Peninsula and Eastern Europe. It is said that UNRRA officials working in the region cannot obtain free and fair reports on how materials are distributed and how work is progressing. In addition to the usual partisan political struggles, legislative disputes in Congress are also a reason for the delay.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] It is reported that any country that allows journalists to enter and report on UNRRA activities without restrictions can request UNRRA relief.</p>
<h3>The United States Suggests to Britain and the Soviet Union: Expedite the Withdrawal of Troops from Iran; Britain Urges the Soviet Union to Pay Attention to the Tripartite Treaty with Iran</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The State Department revealed yesterday that the US government has suggested to the British and Soviet governments that foreign troops in Iran should be completely withdrawn by January 1 next year. The State Department's note to Moscow on November 24 stated that the US government has instructed the US military authorities in Iran to immediately begin preparations to ensure the complete withdrawal of US troops from Iran by January 1. The note mentioned the Tehran Declaration of 1943 regarding Iran's independent sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stated that in view of the developments there, the US government believes that British, American, and Soviet troops should be withdrawn from Iran immediately, because the continued presence of troops in Iran inevitably leads to disputes and misunderstandings. The US government's note continued that the Iranian government has the freedom to move its troops to any part of the country. The US government is well aware that the Soviet military commander in the area may be preventing the Iranian army from acting freely, but such measures have not been approved by the Soviet government. If the Soviet military commander is acting without the order of his government, it is thought that the Soviet government should have ordered him to respect the aforementioned declaration. The Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1942 stipulates that foreign troops must withdraw from Iran within six months after the end of the war against Germany and its allies. Therefore, counting from the date of Japan's surrender, foreign troops should withdraw from Iran by March 2 next year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has presented a note to Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov regarding the events in Iran, asking him to pay attention to the provisions of the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1942 and the contents of the Tehran Declaration of December 1943, and stating that the actions of the Soviet military commander in the area may be due to a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates the Indian Question</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] During last night's House of Commons session, Conservative MP Nicholson asked House Leader Morrison whether the government, as rumored, intended to make an important announcement on Indian policy this week. If so, would it be made simultaneously in both houses, and would MPs be informed of the matter as soon as possible? Morrison replied that he knew that the Under-Secretary of State for India would inform the House of Commons of a proposed statement on India. He did not know when this would happen, but would inform the House as quickly as possible. Nicholson then asked if the announcement was made in the House of Lords, would it be made simultaneously in the House of Commons? Morrison replied that he would pay attention to this point.</p>

A meeting of township chiefs in the first district passed a resolution to request the county government to establish a rent collection office to assist in promoting collection. The county government has also dispatched personnel to districts 1, 3, and 4 to inform tenant farmers about paying the rent, ordering township chiefs and guarantors to make guarantees and pay first to provide leadership. Those who incite resistance to rent will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Traitors and Bandits Who Surrendered are Sent to Hangzhou for Rehabilitation</p>
<p>In this county last month, there were more than 10,000 Jiangnan traitors and bandits who roamed through the area and caused disturbances. After being surrounded and suppressed by the National Army and local militia, they disintegrated. However, many of them were young soldiers and civilians who were coerced and unable to escape due to strict surveillance. Therefore, when passing through the county, they surrendered to county and district-level agencies one after another. According to a reporter's investigation, a total of 44 people have returned. After considering the circumstances, 11 people were given travel expenses to return to their hometowns. The remaining 33 people, including Liu Zixiang, were escorted to Hangzhou by Zheng, the platoon leader of the Second Self-Defense Brigade of this county, on the morning of the 24th of this month, and transferred to the provincial government for rehabilitation.</p>

It has been learned that the branch has consulted the Ministry of Education and submitted three suggestions. As a result, the Ministry of Education, considering that Wanxian is an important town in eastern Sichuan and that educational talent is needed in all aspects, has agreed to the college's third suggestion, which is to rename it "Fucheng College," continue to operate it, and give it appropriate expansion.

<h3>Brief Reports</h3>
<p>The Taipei City District Military Police Team has established a Mandarin Chinese training class in the original location of Taiping National School to promote Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>Chen Bochui, a professor of literature at the University of Shanghai, who is also an editor at the National Translation and Compilation Bureau of the Ministry of Education, arrived in Shanghai by China Airlines plane from Chongqing yesterday.</p>
<p>Our Municipal People's Girls' Middle School, which temporarily relocated to Route Lafayette during the period of false occupation, is scheduled to reopen on the 2nd of next month at its original site at the intersection of Wenmiao Road and Zhonghua Road.

<h3>Morning Friends Basketball Match: Two Grade A Matches Today; Green Forest vs. Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Desheng vs. V Team</p>
<p>There will be two Grade A matches as usual in the Morning Friends Basketball League today, and one additional friendly match. Tickets are priced at 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The first match is Green Forest vs. Overseas Chinese. Green Forest has the guidance of Qian Xucang and follows the rules, making significant progress. Whether in offense or defense, they are methodical. It is a pity that they still lack a key to scoring, otherwise their record could be more satisfactory. In today's match against Overseas Chinese, they should be able to win.</p>
<p>The second match is Desheng vs. the V Team. Desheng is composed of veteran players who are experienced, but their stamina is lacking. The V Team is composed of rising stars who are energetic, but they have difficulty staying calm in battle. Therefore, the two teams have their own advantages and disadvantages. Once they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. An additional interlude is the Hualian vs. US Military Police match. It is said that the US Military Police will send out all their elite players, which should be a wonderful sight. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Green Forest – Overseas Chinese (Grade A) 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Desheng – V Team (Grade A) 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Hualian – US Military Police (Friendly) 7:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Basketball Friendly Matches: Shantou Team Wins Against US Military Police</h3>
<p>East China Loses to Haiqing</p>

The Shantou Team played very actively and won 45 to 34. Chen Qingwei scored 18 points.</p>
<h3>An Outline of India's International University</h3>
<p>— By Leda Guan</p>
<p>A few days ago, newspapers reported that Mr. Tan Yunshan, the Dean of the Chinese Academy of India's International University, had an audience with Chairman Chiang in the temporary capital. I imagine that the name "International University" might not be very familiar to the average person!</p>
<p>The International University was founded in 1902 by the father of the Indian poet laureate Tagore (Dr. Ralindranth Tagore), and it has a history of over 40 years.</p>
<p>Taking a train from Calcutta's Montra Station for several hours, you reach Bolpar, and after walking for another one or two hours, the International University comes into view. Its original location is in Santiniketan, a place near the small town of Bolpar in Bengal, India. It was originally a desolate, barren land, infested with bandits. The "Poet Laureate's" parents prayed silently day and night. Later, a bandit was moved by Tagore's parents and turned from evil to good, and this place became an academic center filled with the sounds of music and learning.</p>
<p>In 1913, the "Poet Laureate" received the Nobel Prize in Literature from the Swedish Academy, and he used all the prize money as funding to run the university. In 1920, after the First World War, Tagore returned home from his travels in Europe and officially named it the International University, melting Eastern and Western cultures into one.</p>
<p>The International University has a fairly large organization. Its established departments can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Middle School Department, divided into junior and senior levels.</p>
<p>(2) University Department, divided into upper and lower terms, to be completed in four years.</p>
<p>(3) Research Institute, offering courses in philosophy, literature, art, Sanskrit, and other national literatures.</p>
<p>In addition, there are women's colleges and vocational colleges, with subjects such as local industry, planting, weaving, and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>As for the faculty, in addition to a few Europeans and Americans and famous Indian scholars, there is also Mr. Tan Yunshan, who left his motherland and went to the distant foreign land of India to work hard to promote communication between Chinese and Indian cultures. He is now the Dean of the Chinese Academy. However, there are not many Chinese students studying there. The school buildings, only the art school and the library, are relatively modernized, while the rest are bamboo fences and thatched huts. Students often freely attend classes outdoors, immersed in nature, living a peaceful and simple life.</p>
<p>Looking back at history, Indian Buddhist scriptures and literature have had a great influence on China, not only in religion but also in culture. We hope that the International University can once again bring about a great exchange of Chinese and Indian cultures!</p>

<h3>High Court Opens Investigation Hearing; Continues Hearing of Traitor Case; Chu Used His Land to Aid the Enemy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai High Court opened an investigation hearing to try a traitor. The presiding judge was Liu Yugui, acting director of the Criminal Division. The defendant's name was Chu Jiutian, 40 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 30, Shangyifang, Route Ghisi. The case originated in 1940 when Kong Xianxiong, a special commissioner of the Central Executive Committee of the Northeast, and Sun Lingao, an inspector, went to the Northeast via Shanghai. At that time, Chu colluded with Qian and Liu to report to No. 76, Route Ghisi, resulting in their detention. It was not until the recovery of Shanghai that Kong and Sun learned of Chu's whereabouts on September 29th and sent him to the Taishan Road Police Station. After the prosecutor's office completed the investigation, a public prosecution was filed according to law. Yesterday, the defendant vehemently denied the charges in court. The court adjourned the hearing and summoned Kong and Sun to testify again. Bail was denied, and he was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang to Perform Again</h3>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang, who has been off the stage for eight years, was invited by the municipal government to perform at the Lyceum Theatre to celebrate Shanghai's anniversary after the victory. People in Shanghai regretted that they could not hear his long-silent voice. It is now learned that Mei will publicly perform at the Majestic Theatre starting today (the 28th). The plays for the first two days are "Assassinating the Tiger" and for the third and fourth days are "The Peony Pavilion."</p>
<h3>Urging Merchants to Value Ethics</h3>
<p>Since the soaring prices in this city have affected people's livelihoods, Chairman Chiang has been concerned about the hardships of the people. He previously sent a special telegram to Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the local association in this city, asking him to unite with respected people from all walks of life to express their opinions and work together to find ways to stabilize prices. The industrial and commercial circles of this city, upon hearing this news, all admired the Chairman's virtue and worked hard to stabilize prices. As a result, speculative activities have gradually subsided in recent days, and the prices of daily necessities have also successively fallen by 5% to 30%. This shows the sincerity and enthusiasm of the citizens of this city in supporting the supreme leader. However, there are still some unscrupulous merchants who do not understand the overall situation and deliberately charge high prices when Allied forces purchase goods or patronize restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, in order to seek undue profits, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of the Allied authorities.</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng Speaks</p>
<p>Chairman Du believes that this kind of situation is inappropriate. Yesterday, he told reporters: The Allied military and civilians who have come to Shanghai this time are all our comrades-in-arms who have fought side by side with us and shared our hardships. When they patronize restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues and purchase daily necessities, we should provide genuine goods at fair prices and be especially self-restrained in order to show our preferential treatment to our allies, and we can also use this to establish credit and develop international trade. If someone is ignorant of the overall situation and greedy for immediate profits, Allied personnel will have a bad impression, which is detrimental to all citizens. It is hoped that the media will condemn them and not be lenient, and that all industries and businesses will encourage each other to respect commercial ethics and revive good customs, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's intention to protect friendly nations and treat the Allied forces preferentially, and follow Mayor Qian's advice. The Local Association is willing to share the mission of advocating justice with the media.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Speaks</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, also issued a statement yesterday: Honesty and trustworthiness in business are our country's inherent reputation, which must be diligently maintained. Moreover, how should we treat the Allied soldiers who fought side by side with us with sincere friendship, give them special preferential treatment and guidance, so as to show the sincerity of our compatriots, directly maintain our commercial reputation, and indirectly enhance our country's position? All local citizens and business colleagues should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Mayor Qian and Service Corps Leaders Hold Reception for Allied Forces; Hope Compatriots will Assist in the Work of Receiving Allied Forces</h3>
<p>Mayor Qian Dajun, Bai Qiju, head of the Military Commission's Battlefield Service Corps, and Lu Meiseng, head of the Allied Forces Service Agency, held a reception for the Allied Forces at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road at 7:30 last night. General Wedemeyer and dozens of senior Allied officers attended, with a total of more than 200 guests. At the dinner, Mayor Qian gave a speech, saying that the Allied forces stationed in Shanghai are brave soldiers who have fought side by side with the National Army for many years and have suffered the hardships of traveling over mountains and rivers under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and General Wedemeyer. We Shanghai citizens should do our best as hosts, and we must fully express our sincerity in respecting guests in all aspects. In particular, our stores must not have the slightest hypocrisy. I hope that all of you present here, as well as the five million compatriots in the city, will assist the work of the Shanghai Joint Committee for Serving the Allied Forces. At the same time, we welcome all Allied soldiers to participate in and guide the various activities of this Shanghai public organization. After Qian's speech, General Wedemeyer took the stage and thanked everyone for the comforting event, and expressed his earnest hope that the five major powers could work together in the future, resolve all problems through mutual understanding, and establish lasting world peace. Finally, he raised his glass to wish Chairman Chiang good health. After the banquet, various entertainment activities were held, which won a lot of applause.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Opera Actor Accused</h3>
<p>Shi Chunxuan, an actor who has moved Shanghai's leisured women's class with his Shanghai Opera performances, is now accused of "kidnapping." It is said that Chen Yukun, the owner of a hardware factory in Pudong, was recently detained by a certain unit because he had dealings with the enemy. He believes that this was instigated by Shi Chunxuan and Fan Jinkun. After being released, he reported it to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the local court. Shi Chunxuan strongly defended himself, saying that he and the plaintiff were sworn brothers. When Chen was arrested, he tried to help him. When the unit wanted the plaintiff to pay four gold bars as a fine, he tried to borrow nine taels from his wife to help. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing because the case still needs to be investigated. Bail was denied, and he was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Race; Misses from Various Countries Participate</h3>

<h3>Deputy Minister Xu of the Central Propaganda Department Reports on New Government Measures; Pan Gongzhan and Others Hope the Press Will Exercise its Authority</h3>
<p>Xu Xiaoyan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, hosted a tea party for the press in this city at the Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, Hu Pu'an, Cheng Cangbo, Feng Youzhen, Chen Xunxi, Zhan Wenhun, Ma Xingye, and more than 70 reporters from various newspapers attended.</p>
<p>Comforting Colleagues in the Press</p>
<p>Xu stood up to give a speech, saying that the Central Government has been very concerned about the press in Shanghai for the past seven or eight years. The main purpose of his trip to Shanghai from Chongqing is to represent the Central Government and express the greatest respect and sympathy to the colleagues in the press who have struggled hard in Shanghai. Secondly, over the years, colleagues in the press in Shanghai and colleagues serving in the war zones in the Southeast may have had many misunderstandings about the situation in the rear. Today, he took this opportunity to give a brief report to the colleagues in the recovered areas. The two points that the current government is most concerned about regarding the general situation in the rear are:</p>
<p>Reducing the Burden on the People</p>
<p>First, we will strive to reduce the burden on the people so that the people of the whole country can have the opportunity to rest and recuperate after the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, such as: (1) Stopping conscription. (2) Reducing taxes. (3) Reorganizing the army, reducing the original 300-plus divisions to 200-plus divisions, reducing national expenditures, which also means reducing the burden on the people. (4) The wartime consumption tax was originally a measure that the government had to take at the time, so the government had clearly ordered its abolition before the end of the war. (5) Simplifying tax collection procedures to facilitate the people. (6) Abolishing traffic control to facilitate travel and commerce. The government is doing its best to do all of the above. The recovered areas suffered even more than the rear during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, so the government, regardless of all financial difficulties, will exempt land tax for one year. Not only that, but the government is also concerned about the suffering of tenant farmers and poor farmers and is implementing a 25% rent reduction, reducing the rent paid by tenants to landlords by one-quarter, hoping that the media will assist the government in promoting this new initiative so that every people can understand.</p>
<p>Strive for Social Stability</p>
<p>Second, we will strive for social stability, such as stabilizing finance. The government has made great efforts, and the government is also doing its best to assist in production and industry. The government has loaned more than 5 billion yuan to factories in the rear in the past two or three months, making every effort to stabilize society. The government's most difficult problem at present is the internal affairs problem, which is the Communist Party problem. The Central Government has always hoped that this problem can be resolved through political means, but recently the Communist Party has dismantled railways in North China, blocked traffic, hindered the surrender of the National Army, and raised the issue of the so-called "liberated areas," making the problem even more difficult to solve. However, the Central Government still hopes that the Communist Party problem can be resolved by political means.</p>
<p>Chairman Pan and Others Give Speeches</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Gui Zhongshu, Li Zikuan, Yuan Yeyu, Peng Leshan, Li Qiusheng, Jin Qindi, and others also stood up to give speeches. Pan hoped to use the power of public opinion to solve the Communist Party problem, tell the facts to the public, and the press should stand on a fair and impartial position to make serious criticisms and ask the people, "Should the Communist Army block traffic?" "Should the National Army be sent to receive the nine northeastern provinces?" The press can test public opinion to clarify what is right and wrong in the eyes of the common people. Cheng said that the two issues that the people of Shanghai are most concerned about now are: (1) They are heartbroken by the number of unqualified receiving personnel, and the media should expose this darkness as much as possible so that the receiving personnel can be vigilant and the government can pay attention to punishing them at any time. (2) The people of Shanghai are deeply troubled by the Communist Army's destruction of traffic and the National Army's inability to carry out its receiving tasks, but their position on the government has always been consistent. Gui Zhongshu reported that foreign people have incorrect views on China's internal affairs from time to time, and he hoped that the press would correct them. Li Zikuan hoped that the Central Government could abolish the Shanghai press censorship system to realize freedom of speech. Yuan, Peng, Li, and others all hoped that the Central Government could provide as much information as possible about important current events. Deputy Minister Xu then responded to each of the opinions raised. At 5:30, the tea party came to a successful conclusion in a very harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Xu was also invited by the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League to hold a symposium at the City Party Headquarters at 11:00 AM yesterday. The executive committee of the City Party Headquarters and the staff of the branch of the Youth League all participated. Xu gave many instructions on the publicity policy in the future.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market Was Active Again Yesterday Amidst Talk of Free Foreign Exchange Trading</h3>
<p>Results Were 37,000 Better Than Before; Public Bonds and US Dollars Both Rose in Tandem</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th), due to Chairman Chiang's speech not mentioning a word about foreign exchange quotations, short sellers felt disappointed. At the same time, reports indicated that the government would adopt a free buying and selling policy for foreign exchange, causing a backlash and a surge in sentiment. At the opening, buy orders were shouted at 780,000, and soon broke through the 800,000 mark. At this time, short sellers were cornered, and buying pressure was suppressed again, causing prices to fall back to 780,000. Afterwards, the US dollar stood firm, and northern financial groups made some advances, stabilizing gold prices. However, as the US dollar continued to rise, hedging activities increased, leading to a situation where supply was less than demand in the gold market. As short sellers began to cover their positions, the market rebounded sharply at noon, rising to over 820,000. Finally, the market fluctuated again, resulting in an improvement of 37,000 compared to the previous day. Silver jewelry also rose to 87,000, while silver taels were still priced at 650 per tael. Initially, silver dollars hovered around 430, but eventually, due to sporadic purchases by smaller investors, the selling price rose slightly to 445 yuan.</p>
<p>US Dollars</p>
<p>Due to the government's adoption of a free buying and selling policy for foreign exchange, cotton mills were eager to settle accounts, leading to a sharp rise in the market. The price increased from 1310 yuan to 1375 yuan, eventually settling around 1350 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar was relatively stable, following the gold market, without any special stimulus. The Australian pound was around 3,300, and the rupee was between 300 and 330 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Bonds</p>
<p>Continued to be surrounded by buying pressure, and external investors also frequently absorbed them. Large investors rode the wave, and Type C bonds even broke through the 400 yuan mark. As a result, all bonds rose by 50 to 65 yuan compared to the previous close. After the sharp rise, be cautious of insiders taking profits.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Off-exchange trading was still not smooth. The rebound in the gold market led to some sporadic investment by retail investors, causing large-cap stocks to stabilize slightly, while small stocks generally rose by about 10%.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Trading shifted from sluggish to stable, also influenced by the gold and bond markets. There were quite a few buyers at the end, and as a result, Ewo Cotton Mills recovered from within 1400 yuan to around 1500 yuan, with all stocks rebounding slightly compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The underground interest rate market saw renewed activity from speculators, and demand gradually increased. After a period of calm, yesterday saw a slight rise, generally ranging from 13% to 16%.</p>
<p>Rice Market Suffers from Abundant Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was depressed due to abundant supply from various sources and rumors of imported rice arriving. Prices for superior rice fell by 300-400 yuan, while medium-quality rice fell by 600-700 yuan. White rice and processed rice also fell by 500-600 yuan. Flour sales remained sluggish, continuing to weaken by nearly 100 yuan. The oil market rebounded slightly after being weak, due to strong demand from the Ningbo financial groups, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybean prices were expected to rebound by 200-300 yuan due to the revitalization of Shantou bean cake sales. Raw peanuts were unchanged. Shaoxing wine sales were sluggish due to continuous arrivals from northern Jiangsu, leading to a downward trend. Wine merchants released their stocks of yellow wine, and new products entered the market, softening sentiment.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Were Quite Active</p>
<p>The yarn market rebounded with the gold price, stabilizing sentiment. Sales from the inland and Shanghai-Nanjing lines increased, making transactions quite active. However, the focus was on 20-count yarn, which rose by around 20,000 yuan, while 16-count yarn sales were sluggish, and the price was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Coal Trading Was Sparse</p>
<p>The coal market remained in a quiet state, with sellers finding it difficult to sell, leading to a decline in trading. However, local prices remained stable. Arrivals of firewood boards for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (Haining, Xiashi, Changan, Linping) continued to increase, leading to a price decline. However, the price of chestnut flowers, used by inland factories as a substitute for coal, remained very stable. Charcoal arrivals have been relatively low recently, showing a slight rise.</p>
<p>Hardware Transactions Were Very Few</p>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market remained stagnant, without any improvement. Merchants were still releasing stocks, but there were very few buyers, and price cuts were severe. Therefore, there were only inquiries, but no actual transactions.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Registration: Severe Penalties</h3>
<p>Special Report: The city's industrial and commercial registration will be announced and implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau immediately. It is reported that the method will be based on zoning. The area for the tenth phase is defined as east of Xizang Road, north of Nanjing Road, south of Suzhou Creek, and east to the Bund. Regardless of whether the business is a sole proprietorship or a partnership, and regardless of whether it has been registered before, it must register according to the deadline and in accordance with the law. This registration is mandatory and different from the pre-war registration. If resisted, penalties such as suspension of business or fines of up to 10,000 yuan will be imposed according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Ham and Preserved Meat Industry Seeks Batch Allocation</h3>
<p>During the enemy and puppet regime, a considerable amount of the stock of ham and preserved meat in this port was requisitioned by the enemy army. Recently, the industry association has petitioned the authorities to request the speedy unsealing of these goods and the allocation to the industry for sale at a fair price to meet market demand.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Stated Capital Amount</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(Continued from November 26th)</p>
<p>Decline in Currency Purchasing Power</p>
<p>It is not excessive to have this in the capital account. Anyone who knows the market situation will not consider my words biased. The pure asset base that is less than the legal currency capital amount should be appropriately reduced to ensure that assets are not inflated and capital is not lost. Then general accounting can be universally reorganized. The secret reserve fund with the nature of undistributed earnings should be used as the transfer amount for the capital amount as soon as possible. If there is still a surplus in the secret reserve after the transfer, or other assets need to be upgraded in valuation, it should be handled separately through capital increase procedures. It must not be confused with this reorganization of the stated capital amount. Furthermore, by extension, the surplus under the capital account should be based on the principle of "realized profits." This is also clearly stipulated in the income tax regulations. Now, with the decline in the purchasing power of currency, the current value of various assets is often far beyond the original price. However, in accounting, valuation increases are not allowed until profits are realized through the sale. Therefore, when reorganizing the stated capital amount, it is best to have a secret reserve available for transfer. I believe that asset appreciation should be transferred with extreme caution, and try to avoid pre-inflating the stated amount of inventory, so as not to conceal future sales revenue, hinder legitimate tax revenue, and the legitimate profit sharing of labor. However, the appreciation of fixed assets is different from business income, and it is still feasible to use it to transfer the stated amount of capital. In this case, it is truly said that</p>
<p>Each Situation is Different</p>
<p>If the original capital was legal tender, and it was combined into puppet currency at a ratio of two to one by the puppet regime, it should of course be directly restored to the original legal tender amount. If the capital was originally legal tender and was increased with puppet currency, as long as the pure asset situation is still good, it can also be balanced as the legal tender amount. If the capital is entirely received in puppet currency, of course, more attention should be paid to its pure asset situation. However, if its current value is good, then the balancing method is not impossible. Even if there is a shortfall, it can be appropriately reduced. At a time when the government is striving to revive industry and stabilize prices, having a substantial reserve is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. If the capital is converted at a ratio of two hundred to one as claimed by some people, and the resulting false surplus is taxed according to law and dividends are distributed according to custom, wouldn't it be cutting more than half of each company's reserves? In recent years, some entrepreneurs have been nominally successful, but actually engaged in speculative profiteering. However, the majority have been silently enduring and struggling in hardship. The depreciation of puppet currency has resulted in this false surplus, but if calculated based on the reduction of the purchasing power of currency, the losses are beyond words. Can we bear to see them suffer further unreasonable destruction? Some say that puppet currency is worthless. This is true now. The more puppet currency of 5,000 or 10,000 yuan, the more useless it becomes. Not only two hundred to one, but even with further discounts, no legitimate industrial or commercial enterprise would want to accept it or value it. However, we in Shanghai have endured hardships and should not forget that</p>
<p>Currency is a Medium</p>
<p>People's livelihoods cannot stop, and transactions cannot cease. The medium is a tool for easy exchange. When using it for this exchange, every household cannot do without it. This was true when the puppet regime required the people to exchange legal tender for puppet currency at a ratio of two to one. Even after that, conscientious entrepreneurs either moved materials internally to supplement the Great Rear, or moved funds internally to establish a new foundation in the interior. The actual exchange rate between puppet currency and legal tender was still balanced last summer, ten to one this spring, and only eighty or ninety to one when the enemy surrendered and Shanghai was liberated, not as high as it is today. If people use the current worthlessness of puppet currency to infer that the puppet currency invested by capital holders in the past should also be discounted more, it would not be fair. After the capital was received in puppet currency, this medium of exchange has long been separated from the investment process. We can recognize that the puppet currency currently in circulation is illegal and should not be considered. However, if we say that capital received in puppet currency is also illegal and should not be considered, would that be fair? Therefore, I dare to solemnly state to all parties that the reorganization of the stated capital amount should not be confused with the reorganization of puppet currency. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Problem of the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Los Angeles, Dr. Bell, who participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb, said that using plutonium instead of uranium as the raw material for the atomic bomb reduced the cost of manufacture and shortened the time. At the same time, he warned that small countries like Portugal could hide atomic bombs in warehouses in Los Angeles, and destroy them before the United States could resist. He also said that the enemy could place an atomic bomb in the sea, creating a huge wave and destroying Washington.</p>
<p>From this dispatch, it can be seen that the progress of the atomic bomb is rapid, and its terrible degree is becoming more and more severe.</p>
<p>Humans have created the atomic bomb, but can humans control the atomic bomb? In this regard, we believe that the governments of all countries must first have a unified goal for the future world in order to achieve this. If everyone works together for a better and more harmonious world, there will be no mutual suspicion, and there will be no so-called atomic bomb problem.</p>
<h3>Let Supermen Control the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>— Yu Fan</p>
<p>According to a recent United Press dispatch, an unnamed American suggested using eugenics and test-tube methods to create a "United Nations Superman" as the guardian of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>This proposal seems somewhat bizarre, but in deference to the suggester's opinion, it has finally been submitted to President Truman and several members of Congress and experts for review.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposal is to produce the most excellent and benevolent human race, and to let these supermen control the atomic bomb with full authority, in order to achieve the goal of benefiting all mankind, so as to avoid being misused by villains.</p>
<p>To produce supermen, the proposer advocates that eugenic experts first select a group of the most intelligent and excellent men in the United Nations as the fathers of supermen. Similarly, a group of women with the highest eugenic value in heredity, health, education, and career should also be selected as the mothers of supermen.</p>
<p>"Supermen" and "Superwomen" can freely marry each other. If a "Superman" belongs to one country and a "Superwoman" belongs to another country, then the children born will represent both countries in the United Nations organization, but he or she only contributes the obligation of children to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The education received by "Supermen" in their childhood must be obtained in the highest academic institutions in the world, one year in a school in one country, and what he receives is world education.</p>
<p>The proposer also advocates that "Supermen" should travel with their mothers in their childhood, traveling around the world, reading and studying, but it must be the case that the mothers can fill this position. If the mothers cannot travel together, a "Women's Group" should be organized, which can be handled by nuns in the church.</p>
<p>He also argues that mothers should not be called "Miss," but should be addressed by a different "title."</p>
<p>As for before the supermen are born, he advocates calling this group of supermen and superwomen the "Atomic Bomb Guardian Training Center," and before the supermen have grown to an age where they have the ability to perform their duties, this group of supermen and superwomen has no right to interfere in the issue of atomic bomb control.</p>
<h3>Curfew</h3>
<p>— Night Watchman</p>
<p>When Lao Shen was about to leave, he suddenly said to me, "Why aren't you leaving yet? The curfew starts at twelve o'clock, and the pass hasn't been arranged yet." I hadn't paid attention. I went back at half past twelve the other night, and the taxi driver didn't make things difficult for me after I explained.</p>
<p>I left the newspaper office at twelve o'clock. The rickshaw driver pedaled very quickly. The road was very quiet. Occasionally, drunk American sailors drove past, shouting in their mouths. My car was not stopped along the way. As I turned the corner, I was stopped by the night watchman.</p>
<p>The night watchman was wearing a Zhongshan suit with two police officers. This time, I explained with what I said two days ago, to no avail. It was useless to explain with more pleasing words. He insisted that we (there were three other people who were also slightly detained) go to the police station to "say a word." There was no choice but to go to the nearby police station together, with the drivers pushing the rickshaws and crowding behind.</p>
<p>The police station was more lively than a dance hall, and like a theater just after the show was over. The open space was full of rickshaws. The entrance to the interrogation room was crowded with rickshaw drivers. Upon entering, it was crowded with people, all of whom were rickshaw drivers. The procedure for enforcing the curfew was also convenient. Each person handed over their residence permit, and the police officer copied down their name, gender, age, and address. Those who did not have a residence permit verbally stated it and it was recorded. After recording, they retreated and stood on the porch. After the rickshaw drivers had left, only six curfew violators remained in the room.</p>
<p>One was a Russian dancer, very beautiful and seemed very witty. She started by complaining angrily, "What, are you going to detain me here? You've made a big mistake! You'll regret it! I'm an American, I'm a GI!"</p>
<p>She had a good eloquence, immediately reminding me of Yuan Muzhi's "Woman and Dog," but good eloquence was useless. The police officer saw her costumed dancing clothes, long boots, and mismatched clothes, and determined that she was a dancer. A dancer was definitely not an American, and if she wasn't an American, there was nothing to say.</p>
<p>The police officer finally agreed to her request, letting her sit in a small iron cage with another Chinese woman. The Chinese woman never opened her mouth, took out two movie magazines, and the two looked at them quietly.</p>
<p>After the dancer was questioned, a man in his thirties, dressed stylishly in a Western suit, walked over, supporting a woman in a red cheongsam, a short black coat, and a beautiful face. She was obviously drunk, staggering, and turned to put her face close to the wall, crying softly. "What, is the Military Commission useless? Or, do you want to make a phone call to the International Hotel? Or detain me, let this lady go out, it would be inconvenient for this lady to be here all night until tomorrow." The man was obviously anxious about the lady's status relationship. His face was flushed, and he angrily patted the railing.</p>
<p>But the section chief on the opposite side just shook his head repeatedly, "No, no." The man had no choice but to give up after several struggles. He helped the lady in to sit down, and a police officer very tactfully gave up his seat, leaning against the lady together. The man sat down and both closed their eyes to rest.</p>
<p>At this time, I turned around and saw the director was debating with another night violator. The director was rambling on, not knowing what he was saying. The person was anxiously searching all over his body. "Here, here, this is my agency's ID card." The director said, "Not releasing you, no, it's before the 12th, before, before is illegal, illegal is not recognized." "Here, here, there's one after the 12th," the civil servant pulled out another one from his inside pocket. The director looked at it for a full five minutes. "No, no, this seal is not official, I don't seem to have seen this kind of seal?" He raised his head and pondered, thinking for a long time again. "Or, you can make a phone call to your agency, send someone to prove it?" The man said that he would rather sit until six o'clock, it would take two days to send someone to prove it, at least sitting in the police station for three days.</p>
<p>Finally, it was my turn. I had a great argument to say, but now I don't know where it went. From the words of the director and section chief, I have seen the great significance of the curfew. Those who have the strength contribute the strength, and those who don't have the strength make up the numbers, otherwise how can we call it military-civilian cooperation? I didn't say anything, and waited patiently to go home at six o'clock.</p>
<p>"So everyone must understand the meaning of the curfew, the meaning of the curfew," the director said a few words after everyone was settled. "Another robbery happened today, clothes were stripped off, for your life's sake." I felt creepy when I heard it, but when I thought that I was in the police station, I felt relieved again. The director saw that it was getting late and went to rest.</p>
<p>As soon as the director left, the police officer also went to sleep. There were six people left in the room. I sat down on an empty chair next to the drunken lady. It was very quiet in the night, occasionally hearing the sound of cars passing on the street. Seeing the neon lights across the street still lit, the fatigue made people a little blurry. Seeing the Russian dancer with her hair disheveled, already asleep, she looked like a foreign Miss in distress. Occasionally, the shadow of the rickshaw driver flashed on the porch. I thought of what the director said just now, and I thought of the Liangshan heroes劫法塲(robbing the execution ground), and the 白龍廟英雄小聚義 (heroes gathering in White Dragon Temple). I opened the Times magazine and read it, one article, two articles. I heard snoring, and when I looked back, I saw the drunken lady and the man sleeping face to face tightly. The man must not have fallen asleep, he was still gently stroking the lady's hand with one hand. I felt cold on my body.</p>
<p>Looking up at the clock, it was only half past four, but the sound of roosters crowing at dawn and the shouting of night soil collectors came from afar. The police officer came out and told everyone to get up and leave, so he shouted the names and issued residence permits. It was 4:45 when I came out.</p>
<p>I walked out of the police station to go home, the moon was still shining in the sky. Passing through the cold and deserted streets, I felt a little scared, but when I thought that the curfew had been lifted, I felt relieved.</p>
<h3>Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters report, stamps printed with the rising sun and saluting suicide pilots are still in common use throughout Japan. This matter seems small at first glance, but it may secretly produce terrible side effects on the Japanese people. We hope that the Allied authorities will pay close attention to this seemingly small but actually large matter, and also pay attention to other similar matters in Japan.</p>

<h3>Belief</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>No matter what we do, no matter how difficult it is, we must have a belief; with belief, anything can be done, and any difficulty can be solved.</p>
<p>In the early days of the European War, when the Allied countries abandoned southern Norway, Germany's blitzkrieg was very successful and unstoppable. It seemed that the Allied forces could not stop it. One night, the British writer Leiston bought a newspaper from an old man selling newspapers on Street Street and asked the old man casually, "How is the news tonight?" The old man replied, "I don't know, sir. Although I sell newspapers, I don't read them; but I have a firm belief that we will eventually win the final victory."</p>
<p>There are many factors for our country's final victory; and the biggest factor is actually due to the belief of the highest authorities. He believed that the Japanese invaders would definitely surrender and that our country would definitely win. Because of the firm belief, the national policy will never be shaken, and the final victory will belong to us.</p>
<p>Before young people do anything, no matter how difficult it is, they must have a firm belief. Without belief, nothing can be done, with belief, nothing is impossible.</p>
<h3>Question Mark</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, talked about the various adverse phenomena in the recovered areas in Beiping, with great emotion, saying that many things were so bad that people could not believe it. And said, "I can not be an official, these many bad things must be investigated."</p>
<p>We believe that these words of Vice President Weng can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we see that the attitude of some officials is probably slightly different from that of Vice President Weng. They seem to be saying: "How can I not be an official? Why must these many bad things be investigated?"</p>
<p>The words are the same, just with a question mark added.</p>
<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>— Murong Yan</p>
<p>I imagine I am sitting in the magnificent box of a grand opera house, under the expansive dome. Beside me is Sharon. The theater is as silent as if devoid of all living things, except for the singing and music on stage. The dimness of the auditorium sets off the action on stage, making it even brighter. The stage lights illuminate Sharon's pale face like a still plaster statue, occasionally crossed by a fleeting, pleasant smile.</p>
<p>However, I saw Sharon's unhappy face not there, but in a comfortable sitting room.</p>
<p>"I'm not going," she said. Three days ago, I had invited her to see a dramatic play, a play of life, this afternoon.</p>
<p>Her refusal was without reason. But she refused.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>This was a trick of emotion. She was crying, for no reason at all.</p>
<p>I watched her tears roll down her cheeks. I gently comforted her, for no reason. Then I wiped her wet eyes with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Afterward, she smiled, also for no reason, without justification.</p>
<p>Some tears are completely unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Wu Qunzhi's Pen</h3>
<p>— Kekou</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Wu, the president of the Bank of Guangdong Province in San Francisco, presented a fountain pen as a farewell souvenir to Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, after the Pearl Harbor incident four years ago, and asked him to use this pen to sign Japan's surrender document. After Japan surrendered, Nimitz did as requested. Recently, Nimitz returned to the United States and returned the valuable pen to Mr. Wu as a memento.</p>
<p>Although this is a tale of rare and amusing events, Mr. Wu's conviction and vision are worthy of our admiration!</p>
<p>Short Story Masterpiece</p>
<h3>The Enemy (7)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>Under such a sense of superiority, she unthinkingly leaned down and loosened the white man's tattered clothes, which barely covered his body. After she had unbuttoned his chest, she dipped the clean little towel that Yuzi had brought in hot water and carefully washed his face for him. Although the man's skin had been roughened by the wind and sun, the texture was delicate, and his skin must have been very fair when he was a child.</p>
<p>Now that this man was no longer a child, she didn't like him any more than she had at first, but thinking about it, she washed the man's upper body. But she didn't dare to turn him over. Where had Sadao gone? His anger having subsided, she became anxious again and wiped her hands on the wrung-out towel. Fearing that the man would catch a chill, she covered him with the quilt again.</p>
<p>She whispered, "Sadao!"</p>
<p>As she called out, he happened to be preparing to come in. His hand was already on the door, and now he pushed it open. She saw him holding a surgical bag and already wearing a surgical gown.</p>
<p>She exclaimed, "Have you decided to operate on him?"</p>
<p>He said curtly, "Yes." He turned his back to her, shook out a sterilized towel, and laid it on the floor in a higher part of the room, then took out his surgical instruments and placed them on it.</p>
<p>He said, "Bring the towels."</p>
<p>Obediently and anxiously, she walked to the shelf and took down the towels. She should also get a few old straw mats to prevent the delicate carpet on the floor from being stained with blood. She went to the back balcony and brought in a handful of straw mats that the gardener had placed there to protect the delicate shrubs on cold nights.</p>
<p>When she returned to the room, she saw that it was already useless. Fresh blood had seeped through the dressing on the man's wound, staining the mat under him.</p>
<p>She cried out, "Oh, the mat!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's stained," Sadao replied, seemingly unconcerned. He ordered her, "Help me turn him over."</p>
<p>She silently obeyed, and he carefully began to wash the man's back.</p>
<p>She said, "Yuzi wouldn't wash him."</p>
<p>"Then did you wash him?" Sadao asked, without pausing his quick, decisive movements.</p>
<p>She said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He seemed not to have heard. She had long been accustomed to his intense focus on his work. She wondered if he could notice what he was operating on while he was operating so wonderfully.</p>
<p>He said, "You have to give him anesthesia when he needs it."</p>
<p>"Me? I've never done such a thing," she replied blankly.</p>
<p>He said impatiently, "It's very easy."</p>
<p>He was now removing the bandage, and the blood flowed even faster. He looked at the wound under the bright surgeon's lamp on his head. Calmly and with interest, he said, "The bullet is still inside, and I don't know how deep the rock wound is. If it's not too deep, maybe I can remove the bullet. But the bleeding is not just superficial. He has lost a lot of blood."</p>
<p>At this point, Hana choked up. He looked up and saw that her face was already ashen.</p>
<p>"Don't faint," he said coldly. He did not put down the tool he was using. "If I stop now, this man will surely die." She put her hand over her mouth, jumped up, and ran out of the room. He heard her retching in the garden. But he continued to work.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Where Can the People's Voice Be Heard?</h3>
<p>— Bu Ping Ming (Speaking Out Against Injustice)</p>
<p>Most Depressed When Complaints Cannot Be Heard; Incomplete Politics Leads to Loss of Popular Support</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: I have been reading your esteemed publication for days, and I can see the spirit of respecting public opinion and serving the people, leaping off the page, which I deeply admire! Newspapers are the voice of the people and a public tool for promoting public opinion. However, where can the people's lamentations be heard? Hasn't the central government already stipulated "freedom of speech" after the victory of the War of Resistance? But how many newspapers are willing to genuinely speak for the people and represent public opinion? I hope that your newspaper can truly live up to its name and fulfill this important mission. The public will naturally wholeheartedly support your newspaper's position. Here are a few suggestions that I would like to contribute, please give me the opportunity to publish them.</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly Punish Traitors: The regulations for punishing traitors have long been announced, and the news of the commencement of trials has also been seen in the newspapers. However, the number one and number two traitors are all people of very low status. Why not first deal with those who hold special appointments and those who are known for colluding with the enemy? The newspapers also reported that more than 400 people were arrested in Shanghai, but only 30 or so were sent to court. Why is the case not being resolved for the rest of the people? It is said that some are allowed bail. The common people are baffled by the subtle clues in the process. The responsible authorities should publicly announce what is happening.</p>
<p>(2) Selling at Reduced Prices Is Not a Good Method: A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that a large amount of cotton cloth was taken out of the sealed treasury and handed over to the four major companies for sale at reduced prices, and that a large amount of white sugar was being auctioned off on the Bund. The common people have doubts about these two methods. Because very few people can buy them. If we consider Shanghai's five million citizens, I don't know if the benefit is gained by one in a thousand or one in ten thousand. In my opinion, the "rationing system" is much better than selling at reduced prices. Strict rationing of daily necessities is the fairest method and can be adopted.</p>
<p>(3) Roads for Special Classes: Nanjing Road is the most prosperous street in Shanghai, but now it has become a road exclusively enjoyed by special classes, which is too arbitrary and unreasonable. Only cars are allowed to travel, and rickshaws and pedicabs are not allowed to pass, which not only affects the market, but also makes it impossible for the old and the young to pass. I have two grandparents in their seventies who, because of their old age, have wanted to go to Nanjing Road several times, but they have been unable to walk there. Children under the age of ten are also unable to approach it. In fact, even though traffic is congested, as long as more traffic police are dispatched to maintain order, it is not necessary to restrict human-powered vehicles. Moreover, Jiujiang and Hankou Roads have already decided to implement one-way traffic, so why not restore Nanjing Road to its original state? (The rest is omitted)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: I agree very much with the opinions expressed by Mr. Bu Ping Ming. Reporting news and promoting public opinion is our duty, and we will certainly work hard to do it and will not shirk our responsibilities. There are indeed many unreasonable things in the current society that need the public to supervise and urge the responsible authorities to be vigilant. We are now in an era of democracy, and any political affairs should be based on the people, which no one can prevent. I advocate that all "people's grievances" and "people's complaints" should not be kept in one's stomach, unspoken and unvented, or discussed in whispers and suspected in secret. These are not solutions. We should have a spirit of fearlessness, a bright and upright attitude, and express our views in writing and send them directly to this column. We will give priority to publishing them and making them public to the masses, so that the responsible authorities can use them as reference material. This is an excellent thing, and I wonder if readers agree?</p>
<h3>Opening Shanghai-Haimen Shipping Route: Urging China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Handle It</h3>
<p>— Haike (Seafarer)</p>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that coastal and river shipping routes have been opened one after another, and that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has taken over enemy and puppet ships, a considerable number. Therefore, all routes and un-opened ports should be quickly reopened to facilitate merchants and travelers. I, the writer, have lived in Haimen for generations and travel between Shanghai and Haimen from time to time. Seeing the various sufferings of sailing vessels over the years, it is truly difficult to describe them in a single sentence. For example: (1) the boats are small and crowded, and there are no awning facilities, so passengers are prone to disease in the summer and rainy weather; (2) the boats stop in the middle of the river if there is no wind, and it is unbearable to hear of pirates coming to rob them; (3) sudden strong winds may cause capsizing, and lives are in danger. The above is by no means a false statement. On behalf of the people of Haimen and Qidong counties, I respectfully request the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to quickly allocate two ships of about 1,000 tons each, sailing daily to and from the ports of Haiqi, which will not only ensure the safe travel of passengers, but also allow the transportation of the main products of the two counties, such as cotton, homespun cloth, grains, livestock, and local products, to Shanghai in large quantities for supply. Therefore, the resumption of shipping can no longer be delayed. Before the war, there were four ships traveling on the Shanghai-Haimen route, two ships a day, which was very convenient. Now that the victory of the War of Resistance has been three months, this route has not been reopened, and the people are looking forward to it. I urge the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to quickly plan to reopen the route in the short term to meet the expectations of the people.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The reasons for Mr. Haike's request for the resumption of shipping on behalf of the people of Haiqi counties are sufficient and are indeed an urgent matter at present. We hope that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will quickly prepare and provide us with information on the handling of the matter for publication to meet the expectations of the people.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Kunshan reader asks: In the newspaper in the upper part of September, it was reported that "all land sales in the occupied areas are invalid." I don't know if it can be redeemed at the original price? I hope you can provide details in your column. (Note) Land that was illegally occupied by the enemy and puppets or forcibly traded by using the power of the enemy and puppets during the period of occupation can be redeemed at the original price. See the regulations issued by the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau for details.</p>
<p>Wang Zhicheng is looking for the owner: At 12:00 noon on the 25th of this month, I picked up 1 million yuan of puppet currency near the Siming Bank on Nanjing Road. I hope the owner will specify what items were attached to it and come to the Tongkang Chengold Shop in the Laojiuzhang Building, Gaoyang Lane, Nanjing Road, to find Wang Zhicheng within this week. If it is not claimed after the deadline, it will be used for the charitable activities organized by Shen Bao and Xin Bao for the benefit of the owner.</p>
