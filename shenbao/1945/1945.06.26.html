<h3>陸上殺傷敵兵八萬名　沉毀艦船六百艘　沖繩島日軍施行最後攻擊</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電日大本營六月二十五日下午二時三十分發表：　繩本島南部地區六月中旬以後之戰況如次：甲，我軍部隊整理小祿及南部島尻地區戰綫後，對於以優秀之空軍及海上兵力掩護下敵軍七師以上之兵力展開勇戰，予以重創，然六月十六日以後，敵軍逐　侵入我軍主要陣地。乙·太田實少將指揮之小　地區海軍部隊，完成掩護護日軍主力轉進南部島尻地區後，傳六月十三日全體將兵對敵作最後之突擊。丙·冲繩方面日軍最高指揮官牛島滿中將，於六月二十日對敵軍主力舉全力實施最後之攻擊。了·嗣後我將兵之一部死守南部島尻地區之重要據點，六月二十二日以後之詳細狀况，現尚不明。　我軍航空部隊，麽續伺機攻擊該島四周之敵艦船及航空基地，並協力陸上戰　。　自作戰開始以來，我軍予敵之損害，計於陸上殺傷敵軍約八萬名，擊沉擊毀列島四周之敵艦船約六百艘，冲繩方面戰塲我方官民，自敵登陸以來，於島山嚴知事領導下，全體一致協力曰日軍，始終爲護衛皇國面奮鬭。</p>
<p>冲繩日最高指揮官牛島中將致決別詞</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電冲繩本島日軍最高指揮官牛島滿中將，於六月十九日對敵軍主力施行最後之攻　前，曾向祖國致訣別詞，其大旨稱：拜奉天命，率全軍勇戰奮鬭者三閱月，誠可感天地而泣鬼神，但終不能粉碎敵之攻勢，事態現已瀕危急。麾下部隊自進駐木島以來，於當地同胞忠誠之協力下，積極進行作戰準備，常迎擊敵軍時，與航空部隊相互策應，期防衛冲繩於萬全，但終　與顧違，不能再繼續其責職，此者上無以對於陛下，下無以對於國民　誠爲遺憾，事已至此，予決將率領發存部下，展開最後之一戰。</p>
<h3>日機冒惡劣氣候猛襲敵艦隊機場　四日中予以重大損害</h3>
<p>琉球羣島基二十五日中央社電　軍航空隊，二十一日以來，運日與冲繼本島南部島尻地區日軍呼應，　惡劣氣候對敵艦隊斷加猛攻，嗣經判明自二十一日迄二十四日止，日軍所獲嚴果如次：日機由二十一日傍晚迄夜間，反糧數次猛炸敵空母等艦船羣，計命中空母。戰艦及其他艦種不詳之艦船數艘，此外，雷　隊亦於該方面對敵艦隊加以果敢魚雷攻擊，擊毀巡洋艦一艘，並對中·北兩飛機塲展開猛襲，使其各處發生大火，更對嘉手納方而海上敵艦船加以猛襲，歷數小時後，尚可遙見數處大火。又二十二日拂曉　　敵艦，命中炸裂之飛機共　十餘　，使敵蒙重大損害。又該日盡問。日軍有力制空部隊衛護之特攻部隊，對冲繩戰塲敵艦隊敢行突擊，當日夜問雷擊隊又復進攻，轟沉敵艦種不詳者一艘，繼之自二十三日薄暮迄二十四日晨，日軍復攻擊敵艦隊，使敵方受極大損害。</p>
<p>日軍發揮特攻威力</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電冲繩本島南部地區日軍地上部隊，現已完畢有組織的戰鬥，但此非謂該島各方面之戰鬥業已告終，嗣後，日軍部隊仍將於南部塲尻地區之二據點繼續奮戰，使敵加重犧牲。又日軍航安部隊對木島四週之敵艦船羣及敵飛機塲，刻反覆猛攻，故誒方雖在戰略上已喪失沖繩地區，但後敵以冲繩爲空海之强力基地，將對日本本土展開激烈之航空攻擊，俾可達成對日攻勢之最終階段，即向日本本土登陸作戰，此點極爲明瞭。日航空部隊對於敵之企圖，將以全員特攻擊對敵施行壯烈之航空攻擊，於冲繩失陷後將益加强烈，務使敵之企圖蒙受重大打擊，同時對於敵艦隊及艦船羣，將發揮恐怖之特攻威力，期使敵之消耗更大</p>
<p>美海陸軍發表損害</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電華盛頓電。美海軍部二發表：日航空隊二十一·二兩日，通續攻擊冲繩本島近海之美艦船，使艦艇蒙受損害。此次日本航空部隊之攻擊，爲一月六日以　最猛烈攻擊。</p>
<p>里爪斯本二十五日中央社電華盛頓訊，美陸軍部二十三日十表。美軍於最初之冲繩登陸作戰，計損害美兵為十萬名，裝給物資爲二萬五千萬磅。</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電華盛頓電，美陸軍當局發表。冲繩戰端勃發以來至六月十九日止，美軍之陸上傷亡已達三萬六千五百八十八名。</p>
<h3>杜立德談話</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二十五日中央社電據華盛頓之交換電訊稱，目下歸國中之美空軍第八轟炸隊司令官杜立德，二十一日接見記者團聲稱，彼將　返東亞某基地，並謂第八及第二十轟炸隊，業完成對日本土實行大規校之「空中挾擊作戰」計劃，兩轟炸隊及英國空軍，近接受美軍最高當局之命令，已次第</p>
<p>里斯本二十五日中央社電據科羅拉多溫泉電稱，美第八航空司令，視察太平洋戰區後，二十二日抵科羅拉多溫泉附近之皮達這飛行塲司令部。按該司令部之主要任務。在於訓練曾參加歐戰之飛行員以參加太平洋戰爭。住民己疏散腹地深處</p>
<h3>峇厘巴板日軍　完成防衛陣　住民已疏散腹地深處</h3>
<p>南西太平洋基地二十五日中央社電敵於峇厘巴板發陸，業爲難以免之事實，然於泰拉干登陸曾遭痛創之敵，此次則特別愼重，邇來連日以空軍作全力　抝轟炸，企圖炸減日軍防禦陣地。同時幷以艦砲猛烈射擊，而以把握登陸之良機，然至本月二十一日，仍未見其有登陸動機，敵軍艦船之勢力幷不壯實，當地之日軍守備隊已將防　陣勢準備完畢。同時住民亦已疏散於腹地深處，而僑居此開之日人，則各　兵器專候敵軍登陸，以期一舉而　滅之。敵軍之侵攻峇厘巴板，實意中事，是以富敵艦出現時，現地駐軍最高指揮官率領參謀等挺身於前綫，在彈雨如注之下親自指揮作戰，而陣中報紙雖於敵軍肓炸下之困境中，依然繼續發刋。</p>
<p>泰拉千島敵軍受創</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十五日中央社電五月一日拂曉，於泰拉干强行登陸，企圖侵入婆　洲油出地帶之敵軍，因遭日軍將兵之　擊，損害甚　，然其企圖侵攻峇　巴板地區之野心仍未消失。自六月十二日以還，敵連日以飛陸　架左右，作熾列　炸，至十五日正午，敵艦艇羣二十餘艘接近陸岸二時十五分對積保加地區實施艦砲射擊，至十六日艦砲射擊漸形邇緩，又開始掃海工作，可知其登陸之野心甚盛。現在敵艦艇之行動，於畫問呼應其空軍之波狀攻擊，對海岸日軍陣地一帶燃料設施作遲緩之砲擊，夜間則因恐怖日方特攻機之攻擊而退避他去。十六日敵掃海艇一艘　近海岸，曾被日軍擊沉，二十日亦擊毀其掃海艇一艘，因為敵之行動益趨慎重，但敵機之空襲仍然頻繁，連日有大型飛約百架執　來襲日軍陣地，然日軍之被害則頗爲　微。</p>
<h3>東亞各地　週間狀況</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電茲將本適大東亞戰區戰况誌次：　中部太平洋方面，琉球海域之敵空母羣，近來仍以數艘　成之特式空母艦據於列島綫南端海上，二十日曾有敵機約三百架來襲大島島。又日軍航空部隊運日目惡劣天氣，對冲繩本島周圍之敵補給艦船羣，繼續加以猛攻、又敵基地航空兵力，於冲繩本島及其周圍，計共有十餘所機塲，似已有五六百架飛機直接協力本島陸上作戰，並哨戒附近海面，且連日對本土空軍基地積極以小型機來襲，故今後雙方之空戰恐將更形激化。　馬里亞納，該島現約可收容B29型撥千架左右，近來以小規模之編隊，對日中小都市來要。　帛琉方面，日電於帛琉南方海城展開之指導權奪回作戰，進展頗稱艦利。又日軍於二十六日夜對敵動員全物資及兵力，嚴加防衛之卡拉昂島之陣地，懷抱炸藥，展開肉搏攻擊，獲得殺傷任人二百餘名，破壞火炮二門，臺　車一輛，水陸兩用戰車二輛，幕舍十一處等大戰果。　婆羅洲，泰拉干島及婆羅洲附近之日軍守備部隊，現仍以寡兵對優勢敵軍加以勇敢邀擊，二十日晨敵輸送傳於密利方面開始登陸。又自六月十六日以來，峇厘把板方面曾有敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦，掃海艦等出此案於其附近，開始掃海工作，現正與日軍陸上守備部隊交戰中。　菲島，敵對北部砍　如拉奧地區展開之空擊，益形活潑化，且敵匪似亦開始蠶動。　印度洋方面，敵船舶之活動，近日漸趨活躍。</p>
<h3>京市昨空襲</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電駐渝美空軍B24型轟炸機二架，二十五日晨三時〇七分侵入南京上空，於下關附近地區投彈後，即行逸去，地上損失輕微。</p>
<h3>豫粵日軍　發動先制攻擊　確保大陸戰略要錢</h3>
<p>北平二十五日中央社電河南方面之日軍部隊，以五月十三日爲期，進攻渝第一戰區軍，確保黃河河畔之重要。盧氏·西安一帶之戰略要綫，而使呼號總反政之渝第一戰區軍之中　，陷於混亂狀態，獲得作戰所期之成果。渝方爲防日軍循此要綫一南下，乃於東方正面及後方調集戰略預備軍三軍九師，以阻止日軍之南下。又日本華南軍之精銳部隊，由六月初旬，將呼應敵美六陸接岸作戰而積極蠢動之余漢謀所屬第七戰區軍之主力，展開先制攻擊，將敵包圍於其本據江西省南部之三南地區中，予以極大損害，共後依然陸續追擊向該地東方安遠潰走之敵軍，頃正擴大戰果中。</p>
<h3>泰攝政强調　日泰親善</h3>
<p>盤谷二十五日中央社電泰國人民議會，於昨（二十四）日之革命紀念日召開會議，售由普里特　政致開會詞，論及日。泰關係時，力稱日泰兩國應根據兩國間同盟條約，始終維持友好親善，當茲東亞戰局愈形激動之時，凡吾泰國民必須一致團結名為保護　國至主　及獨立，希望益加努力云云。又首相於二十二日接見日本記者團，披靡其不動之信念謂，如敵軍侵入泰　領土，吾人決與日軍協力，將其擊滅。</p>
<h3>董必武在美　對記者談話</h3>
<p>北平二十五日中央社電延安代表　必武，前於葡山接見外人記者團時，曾將題爲「中國之現狀與國民之要求」二小册子，分贈各外人記者，暴露抗戰中國之內幕。二十日紐約合衆電稱，董必武此次會見記者團時。曾對渝參政會問題，及軍政部長陳誠關於渝延武力抗爭執聲明，與每股隊延安援助物資等各點，談述如次：於參政會二百四十餘名議員中，如無二十名簽字，則該案即無提出之可能，延安代表僅爲八名，且皆爲渝方所指名者，是以表明不參加該會者，乃理所會然也。又對於淪延之武力衝突，陣滅軍政部長曾承認局地之抗爭，並聲明攻擊延安，並未使用援蔣物炎，余認爲以渝自身所生產之兵器，不能對延安採取如斯積極之攻勢也。反之，延安軍由美國所獲之兵器，僅有轉機槍百二十架·高射砲六門·與彈藥若干云。</p>
<h3>京市國民黨　代表大會</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　中國國民黨南京特別市代表大會，於二十五日上午十一時舉行，計出席王副部長　中，周市長學昌。各主任委員。各執委·各代表三十餘人，山主席團主席胡志寗領導行禮，請上級黨部代表民訓部副師長致訓詞，幷由商兼　記長作工作報告，臨時動　電陳代主席致敬，下午舉行分組審查會，計審查提案五十七件。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>解决民食的根本方策</h3>
<p>低米價的狂漲，可以用治標的辦法；而解決民食的恐慌，必須用治本的方策。治標的辦法只能見效於一時，治木的方策方能徹底使民生安定。治標的辦法是强心針，只能救危；治本的方策是强身劑，方能却病。</p>
<p>今日的希望，不僅要壓低米價的高漲，並且要根本解決民食問題。自從米糧緊急措置之後，對於米價問題，本報曾經屢次論列，今日更鄭州重提出一條新的途徑，一種新的方策，那便是「食糧的綜合統制與保障」。</p>
<p>關於食糧的意識必須重加認　：所謂食糧不僅是米糧，並且還有麥粉，雜糧等等。在百物高漲的今日，有錢的人固然仍　家有儲米，不足爲慮，可是決不能使無錢的人連麥粉和雜　都吃不起。尤其在靑黃不接的日前，米糧根本缺少，單就米糧着想，不足以解決民食，要解決民食，不能不以麥粉和雜　　米糧之不足</p>
<p>舉一個例來說，對於戶口米大家差不多絕望了，當局也實在沒有辦法，可是最近已屢次有戶口麵粉配給，一般民衆正如大旱之遇雲霓，喜形於色。再舉一個例說，米　緊急措置實施時，盟邦軍當局談話中，約定以軍方在內地所收買的小麥雜糧盡量在上海方面放出，於是大家也覺得安心不少。由此可知，民食完全用米　來調劑已經成爲不合實隊的奢望，今後只有以輔助食糧以補主要食糧之不足。</p>
<p>並且採用麥粉雜糧和米糧三者綜合的調整食糧問題的辦法，不僅是今日靑黃不接時的臨時措置，更進一層說，也許就是將來調　民需米糧的根本方案。</p>
<p>要而言之，現在，米糧，麥粉，雜粉向是食糧的不可分的部份，因此必須綜合的計畫，旣不能不以麥粉和雜糧作爲一時的頭痛醫頭，脚痛　脚之用，也不能放任主持各部分統制工作的機構各自爲政，毫無連擊。</p>
<p>解決民食的政策必須一元化，然後採辦民食的資金，運輸，收買，配給　問題，都可以有綜合的，合理的解決。希望民間能從歡迎戶口麥粉及評價雜　的心理，進而單是依賴米糧的　　。</p>
<p>米價又在回漲了，各地的米價因爲米商的投機正在高漲巾，上海的米價因爲這經濟的原因自然不能再低下去。要有效的抑制米價上漲，要徹底的解決民食問題，只有努力「糧食的綜合統制與保障」。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>米糧緊急措置以後</h3>
<p>上海及其他都市，糧食問題又稍呈緊張狀態。國府的米糧緊急措置，實施未久，欲求其完全的效果，尚須待諸數句以後。然就實施後的情勢判斷之，共對民食的幫助，猶難認爲重大。停止統制收買，撤廢米　移動限制以後，結果，米　乃成上海及他處商人投機目標的中心、，以致蕪湖，無錫，蘇州等地米價，亦一致騰昂，內地都市米價的騰貴，不禁威脅當地住民生活，而且對于上海的米價，也有必然的形饗。過去上海的米價漲風，我們斷之爲特殊心理所釀成；今日，共心理的條件雖在克服消弭中，然因內地米價的膳昂，必然亦將盤旋於高峯。換言之，縱謂心理的米似上漲將由經濟的騰貴代替，亦非謬說。</p>
<p>向內地採辦米糧的商人，付出　人的高利，而取得了所需資金。此款送入內地，有如何的困難，及需要鉅額的經費，凡知內地滙兌狀况者，皆能明悉。囚利息與貼現及滙款手續費，商人所有資企，恐將耗其一半，此語決非過甚其詞。因此，購得而運抵上海的米糧，未能低價出售自毋待言。同時，地方公務員軍警等的不法需索，又迄未州改善。此種情勢，若如過去一樣，放任不顧，則米糧緊急措置，豈非亦難顯其效果乎？我們對於這個問題，誠覺憂處！</p>
<p>米糧緊念措置以後，當然應取的辦法，即爲取消地方上的不法需索，及資金問題的根本解決，特別是地方民生問題的對策等。此等方策，今日尚難稱為完善，不法需索及資金的　結依然存在，即特意將移動限制撤廢，其效果亦無可期待。是以我們希望國府更進一步，考　妥善對策。關於撤廢移動限制，日方旣不　矛以最大的協力，則國府亦宜克服物資交流的困難，有效處理此二者。</p>
<p>由於米糧緊急措置的實施，上海的米粉問題大見好轉，無庸　言，然而，爲使此種情勢長久保持下去，而眞正保陣民生的安全起見，則繼緊急措置之後，仍須講求適當妥善的辦法，努力以求緊念措置的效果臻於美備。緊急措置的效果，可由其後的　府施策如何，而或正或負。關於這一點，國府似宜深加考慮。</p>
<p>與米糧緊急措置同時，促進小麥雜糧等的收買能率，以期糧食的萬全，亦有考慮的必要。據傳小麥的收買甚爲順利，然此亦爲米糧投機盛行的結果，朱容一概樂觀。在食糧的綜合的保障上，千萬不可錯誤，這是我們特別希望於中日當局的。（六月二十五日大陸新報）</p>

<p>答：中共的用意見很明白。他們感覺到重慶所以能攻擊他們，這都是因爲美國在援助重慶。他們認爲在重慶政府內指導這種陰謀者，就是所謂「反共三位一體」。因此，重慶政　只　在這批人把持之下，中共對於重慶所作的任何國共合作提議，都是不加理睬的。蔣介石也很瞭解這一點，所以曾向周恩來提議，以「三方委員會」來調整整國共關係。所謂三方委員會也者，即由中共一人，國民黨一人，美國軍官一人所親成的委員會。蔣介石認爲假如單純由國共兩黨來組　委員會，中共或許擔心國民黨又將玩弄手腕，現在旣有第三者美國參加，自然應當放心，大膽接受。然而中共並不如此蠶笨，並且很淸楚地知道美國與重慶，是一丘之貉，無分軒輊，中共自然不上此圈套。要想知道國共合作與國共摩擦的眞相，也須首先瞭解中共憎惡現在重慶指導者的深刻程度。暫就這一點，稍加　明。斯諾曾肯定地說過，中共所以能够長途　涉，完成兩萬五千里長征者，主要動力是幾百萬無地可　　農民，在水深深吏所造成，中　共產黨員的大部份，以前全是　　無地可耕無家可隊的農民。按一九二六年國民黨土地問　委員會第三次大會主要所討論的土地調卉報告，中國農村人口中有土地者，佔百分之四十五：完全沒有土地的佃農與　農，則佔百分之五十五。再就有土地者加以分額，至多不過佔全國有土地者的百分之十四左右者，爲火小地主，然而這批少數大小地主，却擁有全國耕地面積的百分之六十二。反之，僅有一畝至十畝田的貧農，佔全國有土地者的百分之四十四左右，而全國盆農的土地，至多不過佔全國耕地面積的百分之六。至於大小地主，則平常在城市裏作寓公，而單單在鄉下收取地租，這種情形比比皆是。七七事變爆發前，在太湖南岸「開綫弓」這個村落裏，曾煞費數年心血調查該地的費孝通博士，就中國地主如何剝削農民的情形，作過下列的報告</p>
<p>「大地　　有自己的地租　收　關。小地主亦參加其間。該機個稱之爲「局」。佃農不知道自己的地主是張三還是李四，同時就是知道地主是誰，也與自己無關。他們只知道自己是　屬於那一個機關的。佃農的名字和租來的地畝面積，明文記載在賬簿上，一到十月底，機關則通知個別佃農該年所應繳納的地租額。通知書是由專門代理人周交的。局的代理人是該機關的雇用職員，同時該職員握有地方政府所委任的繁察權·所以地主的機關，事實上就是半政府機關。在決定當年所應徵收的地租額時，地主則在地主公會裏召集會議，以決定因永旱災應減收的地租額，和以米換錢的比率（地租以米糧爲本位，但以貨　　　）。該　米糧的交換率，並非市塲上的公認交換率，而是地主公會所任意決定的。佃農爲繳納地租，必須首先　賣他們血汗得來的米。並且在繳納地租時期，米價總是比平時米價低。這種規物地租與貨幣地租的結合，便　人地加重了繳納地租者的負擔。……假如佃戶稍加反抗，拒繳地租，則代理人有權捉他送到地方政府的監獄裏去。假如該佃戶事實上無力繳納地租，則於年底釋放。這並非恩典於他，而是把他拘押在監獄中徒使田地無人粉種，這對地主也只有損失」（費孝通著「中國農民生活」，一九三九年英文版）。</p>
<p>這決不是共產黨的宣傳八股。費博士反倒是國民黨學者，他的著作，充滿着絕對客觀的硏究精神。他所親眼看到的地租，普通是佔全部收獲的百分之四十至八十，甚至竟有佔百分之九十者。因此費博士的結　說：「一言以蔽之，中國農村的根本　結所在，就是農民的收入竟不能維持最低限度的生活。老實說，中國的當前現實問題，就是人民的飢餓問題」。</p>
<p>中國共產黨所以產生的基礎，實際上就是這種普遍存在於全部中國的農民飢餓現象。被　餓所迫的農民，源源不絕地參加中國共產黨，以致造成中古共產黨今日龐大的勢力，因此不難想像得到，中共對於地主階級抱着如何程度的仇視心理。雖說一九三五年中共允許富農存在，聲明保護小資產階級，甚至一九三六年，連地主階級的存在也承認了。但這種政策，毫無疑問是按國際形勢的變化，而採取的一時手段，至於不久的將來，中共一定還想消滅地主階級的存在。中國的地主，同時也是高利貸資本家，同時還兼城市民族商工業的投資者。而他們的子弟，是地方政府的中堅幹部，且又是國民黨君度中的中下級軍官。中共認為重慶政權內最強而有力地代表這種地主。民族工商資本家，地方政府，軍隊等關係者，就是「反共三位一體」，換言之，就是掌握「軍」橫的何應欽，把持「權的張羣，操縱「黨」權的陳立夫等。我發表「重慶政權觀」後不久，有一位左傾靑年來署訪我，說過下面的話：</p>
<p>「一軍」雖然直接　屬於中央政府，然而兵士的給義，却是由地方政府從高地農民手中搜括來的軍米。所以軍隊中的幹部，與直接代表地方政權的地主階級保持着密切關係。「政」的辦成份子，尤其是地方政府的稱成份子，全是當地有力的地主階級及民族工商資本家，就是中央政府派来的官吏，也由于「禮尚往来」「宴会应酬」等上層射虎的行動，與當地支配者集團發生密切關係，於是決定政策的原則，自然都是唯地主階級，民族工商業資本家的利益事　，所謂「黨」，就是地主階級的子弟尚未在政府中物巴到一份肥缺職時，暫時為階級利益表現身手的一個所在」。</p>
<p>中共旣是這樣觀察重慶敵權的指　者層，那末自然不能不注視着渝美勾結背後的陰謀，同時渝美德關係　深，則蘇聯與中共的關係業愈深，當然　是不言而喻的事。（未完）</p>

<h3>夏令衛生運動會　昨舉行開幕禮　胡副秘書長代表市長致訓</h3>
<p>本市夏令衛生運動大會於昨（二十五）日上午九時假南京大戲院揭幕，長官來賓蒞會者，計有周市長代表，市府副秘書長胡澤吾，衛生局長袁溶昌，福利局長周毓英，及各局處長代表等千餘人。由靑少年滬西團部風紀隊長派員在塲協助維持秩序。自由胡副秘書長致訓，繼由袁局長報告籌備經過及開會意義，嗣請來賓額福慶氏講演，歷一小特餘，禮成全體整隊遊行，至八仙橋淸年會散隊。</p>
<p>胡副秘書長詞</p>
<p>周市長代表，市府副秘書長胡澤吾訓詞：「上海特別市夏令衛生運動大會揭幕之期，市長因公不克躬臨，命兄弟代表出席。夏令衛生運動大會按照中央規定，各省市每年舉行一次，吾人於每次舉行時，應切實加以檢討，希望成績能一年勝於一年。</p>
<p>中國國民對公共衛生，向來不十注意，致遭外人輕視，而殆有「東亞病夫」之稱號。中國因爲是晨村社曾，都市極少，將來都市經濟發展，文化發達，設備全，智識程度提高時，當然不爲西洋人所嘲笑。夏令衛生運動大會之舉行，旨在喚起國民注意，由政府創導，以促全體國民之努力。</p>
<p>本人認爲以後怒力目標，第一，為衛生習慣之養成，公共衛生道德之尊重。蓋衛生之注意，非僅一人一家而已，乃整個國民所應注意者，深盼能羣策羣力，創導公共衛生運動。」</p>
<p>袁局長報告詞</p>
<p>本市木届夏季衛生邇動大會，經由本局於三月間擬具計劃，呈請市府核准，即經着手籌備，依照計劃除舉行大會典禮外，並分爲衛生活動及衛生展覽二部份。關於衛生活動，第一日爲淸潔邇動日，第二日為滅蠅運動日，第三日為日。上列各項運動，本局爲取得市民協力起見，事前經召集各聯保長開談話會，以期密切速絡。至衛生展覽內部計分生理衛生，營養衛生，防癆病理肅本，口腔衛生，傳染病圖表，以及其他食品衛生等部門，展覽會之範圍很廣，但是本局因為經費有限，加以實踐侵促。尤其處此非常時期，物資缺乏，所以難免因陋就簡。並於每日晚間七時起假八仙橋靑年會聘請衛生專家，舉行學術演講，本市市民均可一律費聽講，使大家知道公共衛生的意義和目的。</p>
<p>公共衛生的完成，要拿個人衛生做基礎，因為個人衛生的條件，比較容易做到，凡是受過敎育的人，最低限度個人衛生終能保持；但是單靠狹義的個人衛生，忽略了家庭和社會的公共衛生，還是不澈底的，假使一旦傳染病發生，試問你是不是因個人是合於衛生，而得免於傳染呢？所以政府要提倡公共衛生，使全民衆能瞭解公共衛生的重要。</p>
<p>衛生運動之目的，是要減少疾病，使每個國民都有健全的體魄。去做富國强民的偉大事業。我們要達到這個目的，必須要人人負起改造環境衛生的責任，淸除道路垃圾，出淸家庭污物，整潔厠所廚房，撲滅蚊繩鼠類，以防疫癘，這不過是改造環境衞生巾最重要的工作。這種工作，決不是舉行了這個術生運動大會就成功了，衛生運動不過是借着這個機會，喚起一般市民把「衛生」二字，切實瞭解，而促進每個人養成衛生的習慣，以保大衆生侖安全，同時減少疾病和死亡率。不過這種工作，不是人民片面之事，也不是單靠政府力量所能做到，必須互相作，才能達到人民健康，希望諸君參加大會後回去，以個人首先倡導切實推行，使上海市每個市民都能達到健康，亨盡天　，才能算本市公共衛生的成功，這是本人十二萬分所希望的。</p>
<p>展覽會及演講</p>
<p>揭幕典禮舉行後，即開始衛生展覽，會塲設於八仙橋靑年會，共分二區，內部資料計有第一室內陳到：　市塲檢査，　乳品檢查，　化學檢査，　化製塲出品，　病理檢査（標木），　口腔衞生等。第二室內陳列關於：　學校衛生，　兒童保障，　營養與健康，傳染病，　防癆，　麻瘋，　生命統計，　實際蔬菜標本，　消毒滅蟲二具，　隔敵醫院等各有關公共術生之圖標，非常詳細，各界參觀者頗形踴躍。昨（二十五）日下午八時該會依照預定計劃，請醫學專家顏福慶氏演講「麻瘋」及放映有關公共術生之幻　片。又訊今（二十六）晚請汪企張醫師講演演「防癆」云。</p>

<h3>停用撥款單後　行莊改發北部票　銀錢業盼中儲供給現鈔</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業，前因現鈔缺乏，曾發行撥款單，補助其流通，便利固多，弊亦　生，該兩業為策安全計，已通告各行莊定於七月三日起，一致停止使用撥款單。記者以該撥款單停止使用期間前後，銀錢業應予處理及迅行準備之重要事宜正多，乃訪金融界各負責方面，徵詢其意見。</p>
<p>停用撥單重大意義</p>
<p>擄表示當局爲適應戰時通貨之緊縮政策，故有發行撥款單之必要，亦屬戰時不可或免之過程。惟發行以後，輾轉授受，流向外埠，爲數甚鉅，太市各業亦多執有遲遲不爲付款之提示，況偽造撥款單，層見壘出，影響金融至大。付款人信用究竟如何，亦堪注目。按發行撥款單首在防止通貨膨脹，而確當有收縮通貨之功能，然發行撥款單久之不爲付款提示，仍予繼續不斷發行，又何能免信用抑揚之處。此金融當局決意停止撥款單使用之措施，自有重大意義在焉。</p>
<p>限期以前解存行莊</p>
<p>決定如期</p>
<p>停止使用之撥款單，即中儲滬行及銀聯會錢準庫，由各銀行錢莊所領用之支票，凡本市各業及各地姦人持有該項撥款單者，儘於七月三日限期以前，解存往來行莊，最爲適宜，如屬萬不得已而致逾期，行莊方面並費絕對拒收，乃為逾期只有收進，不再開發撥款單於往來客戶，於七月三日起，各行莊對各客戶祗開發各自本票，且於應付現鈔之數額外，絕對審慎開發本票，且限以十日內，由執票人提示。但該本票數流通額，過多亦非所宜，深盼中儲當局，能予儘量准許銀錢業聯席會議所決定各行莊所需之現鈔頭寸，進而並允許該兩業公會各會員行莊，近所請求之現鈔數額。銀錢業倘能少發本票一紙，即其担當責任可減少一分，且該項本票，因有平行　綫關係，祗可提出交換及轉賬，但不能視作現鈔同樣效用。</p>
<p>下月可能供給現鈔</p>
<p>昨銀根復緊，乃撥款單下月初停止流通，各方對於各行莊之本票，不無有弊多利少之感。貼現母萬元仍在二千元左右，此風有息滅可能。中儲方面通知銀錢業，嚴禁行莊職員走私，有新計劃在下月三日起，大小各行莊每戶每日有供給現鈔三萬元實現可能。</p>
<p>作是項非法交易，且已查得實據，呈請上峯曰將會同金融檢查當局，實施檢舉罰辦。</p>
<h3>政治保衛部一局滬區　破獲假名招搖要犯</h3>
<p>靑島人劉文武，年二十八歲，寓海寗路八二一號亭子問內，流浪海上失榮已久，近因滬上生活程度奇高，無法維持生活，乃竟異想天開，假借「政治保衛部特派上海　監處」名義，在外招搖撞騙，濫發職官身份證，詐款度日，此一不法鉅案，業經該部第一局上海區縝密破獲。茲將經過情形探誌如</p>

<p>破獲脛骨</p>
<p>政治保衛部第一局上海區於六月七日最接得密報後，以本部組織中向無「特派上海艦監處」名義，知爲假名招搖撞騙，立即　派幹員，四出偵查，果於當夜在滬西勞勃生路英　里將劉犯所委之少校主任李命金及中尉書記王筱　等兩名補獲，根據獲犯口供，又馳赴海寗路八二一號將劉犯正身拘獲到案，並抄出私刻之　防圖戰十餘件，以及私印之職官證手槍　暨　案名册等文件甚多，一併解區訊究。</p>
<p>希望檢舉</p>
<p>政治保衛部所屬機構，端爲保衛政治，肅淸反動，檢舉貪污，維護地方而設，紀律森嚴，決無軌外行動者，此後希望各界注意，如有發現上項類似之假借名義，招搖撞騙情事，可就近向上海梵王渡路七十六號政治保衛部第一局上海區檢舉告發，以免受愚，而肅法紀。</p>

<h3>Eight Thousand Enemy Soldiers Killed on Land, Six Hundred Ships Sunk or Destroyed: Japanese Forces on Okinawa Island Launch Final Attack</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on June 25th: The battle situation in the southern Okinawa Island region since mid-June is as follows: A. Our forces, after consolidating the battle lines in the Oroku and southern Shimajiri areas, engaged in courageous battles against the enemy forces of more than seven divisions, who were supported by superior air and naval power, inflicting heavy casualties. However, after June 16th, the enemy gradually invaded our main defense lines. B. The naval forces in the Oroku area, commanded by Rear Admiral Minoru Ota, completed the task of covering the retreat of the main Japanese force to the southern Shimajiri area, and it is reported that on June 13th, all officers and soldiers launched a final assault against the enemy. C. Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces on Okinawa, launched a full-scale final attack against the main enemy force on June 20th. D. Subsequently, some of our soldiers defended the important strongholds in the southern Shimajiri area to the death. The detailed situation after June 22nd is currently unknown. Our air force continues to seize opportunities to attack enemy ships and air bases around the island, and to cooperate with ground battles. Since the start of the operation, the damage inflicted on the enemy by our forces is estimated at approximately 80,000 enemy soldiers killed on land and approximately 600 enemy warships sunk or destroyed around the islands. On the Okinawa battlefield, our officials and civilians, under the leadership of Governor Shigeru Izumi, have unanimously cooperated with the Japanese army since the enemy landed, fighting to protect the imperial nation.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Ushijima, Japanese Supreme Commander on Okinawa, Delivers Farewell Address</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: Lieutenant General Mitsuru Ushijima, the supreme commander of the Japanese forces on Okinawa Island, delivered a farewell address to the motherland on June 19th, before launching the final offensive against the main enemy force. The gist of his address was as follows: "By order of Heaven, I have led the entire army in brave and fierce battles for three months. This is truly moving to Heaven and earth, and causes the spirits to weep. However, we have ultimately been unable to crush the enemy's offensive, and the situation is now on the verge of crisis. Since my subordinate units advanced to this island, they have actively prepared for battle with the sincere cooperation of the local compatriots. When constantly engaging the enemy, they have coordinated with the air force, hoping to defend Okinawa perfectly. But ultimately, I have acted contrary to my wishes and cannot continue my duties. I am unable to face His Majesty and unable to face the nation; I am truly regretful. Since things have come to this, I have decided to lead my remaining subordinates and launch one last battle."</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bravely Attack Enemy Fleet and Airfields in Adverse Weather, Inflicting Significant Damage in Four Days</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The army air force, since the 21st, has been cooperating with the Japanese forces in the southern Shimajiri area of Okinawa Island, relentlessly attacking the enemy fleet in adverse weather. It has since been determined that the results obtained by the Japanese forces from the 21st to the 24th are as follows: From the evening of the 21st to the night, Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed enemy aircraft carriers and other warships, hitting aircraft carriers, battleships, and other warships of unspecified types. In addition, torpedo squadrons also carried out daring torpedo attacks on the enemy fleet in the area, destroying one cruiser and launching fierce attacks on the central and northern airfields, causing large fires everywhere. Furthermore, they launched fierce attacks on enemy ships at sea off Kadena, and after several hours, several large fires could still be seen from a distance. Again on the morning of the 22nd, enemy ships were attacked, with more than a dozen planes hitting and exploding, causing heavy damage to the enemy. Also on the same day the Japanese militarys powerful air force protected special attack units, which daringly attacked enemy fleets. On the same night torpedo units again attacked sinking one enemy ship of unspecified type. Further beginning at dusk on the 23rd until the morning of the 24th, the Japanese forces again attacked the enemy fleet, causing them to suffer great damage.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Demonstrate Special Attack Prowess</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 24th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese ground forces in the southern Okinawa Island region have now completed organized combat, but this does not mean that the fighting in all areas of the island has ended. Subsequently, Japanese units will continue to fight fiercely in the two strongholds in the southern Shimajiri area, causing the enemy to suffer heavier casualties. Furthermore, the Japanese naval air force is repeatedly attacking the enemy fleet and airfields around Okinawa, so although we have strategically lost the Okinawa area, it is clear that the enemy, using Okinawa as a powerful air and sea base, will launch fierce air attacks on the Japanese mainland in order to achieve the final stage of their offensive against Japan, namely, a landing operation on the Japanese mainland. The Japanese air force, in response to the enemy's intentions, will launch heroic air attacks against the enemy with all-out special attacks. This will be intensified after the fall of Okinawa, so as to inflict heavy blows on the enemy's plans. At the same time, the terrifying special attack prowess will be unleashed against the enemy fleet and warships, so as to cause the enemy to suffer even greater losses.</p>
<p>US Army and Navy Announce Losses</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram, Washington Telegram. The US Navy Department announced: Japanese air forces have continuously attacked US ships in the seas near Okinawa Island on the 21st and 22nd, causing damage to the ships. This attack by the Japanese air force was the most intense attack since January 6th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram, Washington News. The US Army Department made a statement on the 23rd. The initial US landing operation on Okinawa resulted in 100,000 US soldier casualties and 250 million pounds of supply losses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram, Washington Telegram. The US Army authorities announced: Since the outbreak of the Okinawa campaign up to June 19th, US ground casualties have reached 36,588.</p>
<h3>Doolittle's Remarks</h3>
<p>Zurich, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a Washington exchange of telegrams, General Doolittle, commander of the US Eighth Air Force bomber group, who is currently returning home, told a group of reporters on the 21st that he would return to a certain base in East Asia. He also said that the Eighth and Twentieth Bomber Groups have completed a plan to carry out large-scale "aerial pincer attacks" on the Japanese mainland. The two bomber groups and the British Air Force have recently received orders from the highest US authorities and are proceeding accordingly.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a telegram from Colorado Springs, the commander of the US Eighth Air Force, after inspecting the Pacific Theater, arrived on the 22nd at the headquarters of the Peterson Airfield near Colorado Springs. The main mission of this headquarters is to train pilots who have participated in the European war to participate in the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Balikpapan Complete Defense Preparations: Residents Evacuated Deep Inland</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: An enemy landing in Balikpapan is considered difficult to avoid. However, the enemy, having suffered a crushing defeat in the landing at Tarakan, is particularly cautious this time. In recent days, they have been using air force to conduct full-scale bombing in an attempt to weaken the Japanese defensive positions. At the same time, they are also using naval guns to bombard fiercely, seeking a good opportunity to land. However, as of the 21st of this month, there is still no sign of them having a landing motive, and the strength of the enemy warships is not substantial. The local Japanese garrison has completed the preparation of the defensive positions. At the same time, the residents have also been evacuated deep inland, and the Japanese residing here are each equipped with weapons, waiting for the enemy troops to land, in the hope of annihilating them in one fell swoop. The enemy's invasion of Balikpapan is indeed expected. Therefore, when enemy ships appear, the local supreme commander leads the staff to the front line and personally directs the battle under a hail of bullets. And the camp newspaper continues to be published despite the difficult circumstances of the enemy's bombing.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Suffer Losses on Tarakan Island</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The enemy forces, which forcibly landed on Tarakan on the morning of May 1st in an attempt to invade the oil-producing area of Borneo, suffered heavy losses due to the fierce resistance of the Japanese soldiers. However, their ambition to invade the Balikpapan area has not disappeared. Since June 12th, the enemy has been carrying out intense bombing with about ten airplanes, and at 2:15 PM on the 15th, a fleet of more than twenty enemy ships approached the land and carried out naval bombardment of the Sepinggang area. On the 16th, the naval bombardment gradually diminished and mine sweeping operations began, indicating their strong desire to land. Currently, the actions of the enemy ships are coordinated with the wave-like attacks of their air force, carrying out slow bombardment of the fuel facilities in the coastal Japanese positions. At night, they retreat elsewhere due to fear of attacks by Japanese special attack aircraft. One enemy minesweeper approached the coast and was sunk by Japanese forces on the 16th. Another enemy minesweeper was also destroyed on the 20th. Because of this, the enemy's actions are becoming more cautious, but enemy air raids are still frequent. Every day, about a hundred large aircraft come to attack the Japanese positions. However, the damage to the Japanese forces is quite minimal.</p>
<h3>Weekly Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The following is a summary of the war situation in the Greater East Asia War zone this week: In the Central Pacific area, the enemy aircraft carrier groups in the Ryukyu waters have recently been anchored on the southern end of the island chain, each composed of several special aircraft carrier vessels. On the 20th, about 300 enemy aircraft attacked Oshima Island. In addition, the Japanese air force, despite the adverse weather conditions, has continued to fiercely attack the enemy supply ships around Okinawa Island. Furthermore, the enemy's base air power in Okinawa Island and its surroundings, with a total of more than ten airfields, seems to have five to six hundred aircraft directly cooperating with the land operations on the island and patrolling the nearby sea surface. They are also actively attacking the mainland air force base with small aircraft every day, so air battles between the two sides are likely to intensify in the future. In the Mariana Islands, the island can now accommodate about a thousand B-29 aircraft. Recently, small-scale formations have attacked small and medium-sized cities in Japan. In Palau, the Japanese forces are conducting an operation to retake control in the sea south of Palau, and progress is quite favorable. In addition, on the night of the 26th, the Japanese forces launched a surprise attack on the defenses of the island of Karaon. Carrying explosives, they engaged in close combat, killing or wounding more than two hundred enemy personnel, destroying two artillery pieces, one trolley, two amphibious tanks, and eleven barracks, resulting in great battle gains. In Borneo, the Japanese garrison forces near Tarakan Island and Borneo are currently bravely engaging a superior enemy with a small number of troops. On the morning of the 20th, enemy transport ships began landing in the Miri area. Since June 16th, enemy cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers, etc., have been appearing near Balikpapan and have begun mine sweeping operations, and are currently engaged in combat with the Japanese land defense forces. In the Philippines, enemy air strikes against the northern Cagayan region are becoming more active, and enemy bandits seem to be starting to move. In the Indian Ocean, enemy shipping activity has been increasing recently.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Nanking Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: Two US Air Force B-24 bombers based in Chongqing invaded the skies over Nanjing at 3:07 AM on the 25th, dropped bombs in the vicinity of Xiaguan, and fled. Ground damage was minor.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Henan and Guangdong Launch Preemptive Strikes to Secure Strategic Points on the Mainland</h3>
<p>Beijing, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Japanese forces in Henan province launched an attack on the troops of the First War Zone in Chongqing on May 13th, aiming to secure the strategic points along the Yellow River bank in the Luoyang and Xi'an area. This disrupted the headquarters of the First War Zone army, achieving the anticipated results. To prevent the Japanese forces from advancing further south along this route, the Chongqing side has mobilized strategic reserve forces consisting of three armies and nine divisions from the eastern front and the rear to block the Japanese advance south. In addition, the elite units of the Japanese South China Army, starting in early June, launched a preemptive strike against the main force of the Seventh War Zone army under Yu Hanmou, who were actively preparing to respond to a landing operation by the US Sixth Army. The enemy was surrounded in the SanNan area in southern Jiangxi province, their base area, and suffered great losses. The pursuit of the enemy troops, who are in a state of collapse towards An Yuan, east of the area, is continuing.</p>
<h3>Thai Regent Emphasizes Thai-Japanese Friendship</h3>
<p>Bangkok, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Thai National Assembly convened a meeting yesterday (24th) on the anniversary of the revolution. Regent Pridi Banomyong delivered the opening address, discussing the relationship between Japan and Thailand. He emphatically stated that Thailand and Japan should maintain friendship based on the alliance treaty between the two countries. At a time when the East Asian war situation is becoming more intense, all Thai nationals must unite to protect the sovereignty and independence of the nation, and he hopes for even greater efforts. Furthermore, the Prime Minister met with a group of Japanese reporters on the 22nd, firmly stating his unwavering belief that if enemy forces invade Thai territory, we will cooperate with the Japanese army to defeat them.</p>
<h3>Dong Biwu's Conversation with Reporters in America</h3>
<p>Beijing, June 25th, Central News Agency Telegram: Yan'an representative Dong Biwu, previously in Fushan meeting with foreign reporters, had presented foreign reporters with two pamphlets entitled "The Current Situation in China and the Demands of the People", exposing the inside story of the War of Resistance. A New York United Press dispatch of the 20th stated that Dong Biwu, in his meeting with the reporter group, discussed the Chongqing Political Council, the statement by Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng regarding armed resistance, and the aid material given to the Eighth Route Army as follows: Of the 240 plus councillors in the People's Political Council, no proposal can be presented without twenty names signing it, Yan'an had only eight representatives, and they were all named by Chongqing, it is only right that they had expressed that they wouldn't attend the conference. In regards to the armed conflict with Yan'an, the Minister of Military Affairs had admitted to regional resistance, stating that material given as aid was not used in attacking Yan'an. I believe that with the ordnance Chongqing produces themselves, they will not be able to launch such a positive attack against Yan'an. On the contrary, the ordnance given by the US to the Yan'an army only consist of 120 rotating machine guns, 6 anti-aircraft guns, and a small amount of ammunition.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Strategy for Solving the People's Food Crisis</h3>
<p>Curbing the soaring rice prices can be achieved through stopgap measures, but resolving the people's food panic requires fundamental solutions. Stopgap measures can only be effective for a short time, while fundamental solutions can thoroughly stabilize people's livelihoods. Stopgap measures are like stimulants, only effective in emergencies; fundamental solutions are like tonics, only effective in preventing disease.</p>
<p>Today's hope is not only to suppress the soaring rice prices, but also to fundamentally solve the food problem. Since the implementation of the Emergency Rice Measures, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed the issue of rice prices. Today, we propose a new path and a new strategy: "Comprehensive Control and Guarantee of Food Supplies."</p>
<p>The awareness of food supplies must be re-examined: The term "food supplies" includes not only rice but also wheat flour, coarse grains, etc. In today's environment of soaring prices, those with money can certainly afford to have rice reserves at home, which is not a concern. But we must not allow those without money to be unable to afford even wheat flour and coarse grains. Especially in the lean season, when rice is fundamentally scarce, focusing solely on rice is not enough to solve the food problem. To solve the food problem, we must supplement the rice shortage with wheat flour and coarse grains.</p>
<p>For example, everyone has almost given up hope for household rice rations, and the authorities really have no way to provide them. However, household flour rations have been repeatedly distributed recently, and the general public is overjoyed, like a cloud in a great drought. As another example, when the Emergency Rice Measures were implemented, the Allied military authorities stated that the wheat and coarse grains purchased by the military in the interior would be released in Shanghai as much as possible, which reassured everyone. From this, we can see that relying entirely on rice to regulate food supplies has become an unrealistic expectation. In the future, we can only supplement the shortage of staple foods with auxiliary food supplies.</p>
<p>Moreover, adopting the method of comprehensively adjusting food supplies with a combination of wheat flour, coarse grains, and rice is not only a temporary measure during the current lean season, but may even be the fundamental plan for regulating people's rice needs in the future.</p>
<p>In short, rice, wheat flour, and coarse grains are now inseparable parts of food supplies. Therefore, there must be a comprehensive plan. We cannot only use wheat flour and coarse grains as temporary fixes for temporary problems, nor can we allow the agencies responsible for controlling each component to act independently without any coordination.</p>
<p>The policy for solving the food crisis must be unified, so that the issues of food procurement funding, transportation, purchasing, and distribution can all be solved comprehensively and rationally. We hope that the people can learn from the psychology of welcoming household wheat flour and cheap coarse grains, and stop relying solely on rice.</p>
<p>Rice prices are rising again. Rice prices in various regions are soaring due to speculation by rice merchants. The rice price in Shanghai cannot be lowered further due to economic reasons. To effectively curb rising rice prices and thoroughly solve the food problem, we must strive for "Comprehensive Control and Guarantee of Food Supplies."</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>After the Emergency Rice Measures</h3>
<p>In Shanghai and other cities, the food problem has again become somewhat tense. The National Government's Emergency Rice Measures have not been implemented for long, and their full effect must still await a few sentences later. However, judging from the situation after the implementation, it is difficult to consider the help to people's food as significant. After the cessation of controlled purchases and the abolition of rice restrictions on movement, as a result, rice has become the center of speculative targets for merchants in Shanghai and elsewhere, leading to a unified increase in rice prices in Wuhu, Wuxi, Suzhou and other places. The increase in rice prices in the interior cities cannot but threaten the lives of local residents, and also has a necessary impact on rice prices in Shanghai. In the past, the rise in rice prices in Shanghai, we determined it to be caused by a special mentality. Today, although the conditions of this mentality are being overcome and eliminated, the increase in rice prices in the interior will inevitably hover at a peak. In other words, even if the psychological rise in rice prices will be replaced by economic gains, it is not a fallacy.</p>
<p>Merchants who purchase rice from the interior pay high interest rates and obtain the required funds. How difficult it is to send this money into the interior, and the huge amount of funds required, anyone who knows the interior exchange situation can understand. Because interest and discounting and remittance fees, the merchants' capital, I am afraid that half of it will be consumed. This statement is by no means exaggerated. Therefore, it goes without saying that the rice purchased and transported to Shanghai cannot be sold at a low price. At the same time, the illegal demands of local civil servants, military police, etc. have not yet been improved. If this situation is ignored as in the past, will the Emergency Rice Measures not be difficult to show their effect? We are sincerely worried about this issue!</p>
<p>After the Emergency Rice Measures, the measures that should be taken are to cancel the illegal demands in the localities and to fundamentally solve the funding problem, especially the countermeasures for the people's livelihood in the localities. These strategies are still difficult to be called perfect today. Illegal demands and funding problems still exist. Even if the movement restrictions are deliberately abolished, its effect is still not expected. Therefore, we hope that the National Government will further consider appropriate countermeasures. Regarding the abolition of movement restrictions, since the Japanese side does not spare its greatest cooperation, the National Government should also overcome the difficulties in the exchange of goods and effectively handle these two.</p>
<p>Due to the implementation of the Emergency Rice Measures, the rice flour problem in Shanghai has greatly improved, which goes without saying. However, in order to maintain this situation for a long time and to truly protect the safety of the people's livelihood, after the emergency measures, it is still necessary to seek appropriate and proper methods and strive to make the effect of the emergency measures perfect. The effect of emergency measures depends on how the government's subsequent policies are, and it may be positive or negative. Regarding this point, the National Government should consider it deeply.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Emergency Rice Measures, it is also necessary to consider promoting the purchasing efficiency of wheat and coarse grains in order to ensure the safety of food. It is said that the purchase of wheat is very smooth, but this is also the result of the prevalence of rice speculation, and Zhu Rong is generally optimistic. In the comprehensive guarantee of food, do not make mistakes, this is what we especially hope from the Chinese and Japanese authorities. (June 25th, Continental News)</p>
<h3>Random Chats from the Balcony</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>Chongqing in the Eyes of the Chinese Communists: So what exactly is the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party's intention in attacking the Chongqing government?</p>
<p>Answer: The CCP's intention is very clear. They feel that Chongqing is able to attack them because of American aid to Chongqing. They believe that the "anti-communist trinity" is guiding this conspiracy within the Chongqing government. Therefore, as long as the Chongqing government is controlled by this group of people, the CCP will ignore any proposals for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists made to Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek also understood this point, so he proposed to Zhou Enlai a "three-party committee" to adjust the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The so-called three-party committee is a committee formed by one person from the CCP, one from the Kuomintang, and one American military officer. Chiang Kai-shek believed that if the committee were solely composed of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the CCP might worry that the Kuomintang would play tricks again. Now that a third party, the United States, is involved, they should naturally feel at ease and boldly accept it. However, the CCP is not so foolish and clearly knows that the United States and Chongqing are birds of a feather, with no distinction between high and low. The CCP will naturally not fall into this trap. To know the truth about Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and Kuomintang-Communist friction, one must first understand the CCP's deep hatred for the current leaders of Chongqing. Let me briefly explain this point. Edgar Snow once affirmatively said that the main driving force behind the CCP's ability to complete the 25,000-mile Long March was the millions of landless peasants who were created by the oppression of corrupt officials. The majority of Chinese Communist Party members were previously landless peasants with no home to return to. According to the land survey report discussed at the third meeting of the Kuomintang Land Commission in 1926, landowners accounted for 45 percent of the rural population in China; landless tenant farmers and agricultural laborers accounted for 55 percent. Furthermore, among the landowners, small landlords, who owned no more than 14 percent of the land in the country, owned 62 percent of the country's arable land. Conversely, poor peasants with only one to ten mu of land accounted for about 44 percent of the landowners in the country, and their land accounted for no more than 6 percent of the country's arable land. As for the large and small landlords, they usually lived as absentee landlords in the city and simply collected rent in the countryside, a very common phenomenon. Before the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, Dr. Fei Xiaotong, who spent several years painstakingly investigating the "Kāi Xiàn Gōng" village on the south bank of Taihu Lake, made the following report on how Chinese landlords exploited peasants:</p>
<p>"The large landlords have their own rent collection agencies. Small landlords also participate in it. This organization is called a 'bureau.' Tenant farmers don't know whether their landlord is Zhang San or Li Si, and even if they know who the landlord is, it has nothing to do with them. They only know which organization they belong to. The tenant farmer's name and the area of rented land are clearly recorded in the account books. At the end of October, the organization notifies individual tenant farmers of the amount of rent they must pay for the year. The notification is delivered by a specialized agent. The agent of the bureau is an employee hired by the organization, and the employee also holds the power of inspection appointed by the local government. Therefore, the landlord's organization is, in fact, a semi-governmental organization. When determining the amount of rent to be collected that year, the landlords hold a meeting in the Landlords' Association to decide on the amount of rent reduction due to drought and the rate of converting rice into money (rent is based on rice, but paid in cash). The rice exchange rate is not the publicly recognized exchange rate in the market, but is arbitrarily determined by the Landlords' Association. To pay the rent, tenant farmers must first sell the rice they have earned through their blood and sweat. And during the rent payment period, the price of rice is always lower than the usual price. This combination of in-kind rent and monetary rent further increases the burden on those who pay the rent. ... If the tenant farmer resists slightly and refuses to pay the rent, the agent has the right to take him to the local government's prison. If the tenant farmer is actually unable to pay the rent, he will be released at the end of the year. This is not a kindness to him, but detaining him in prison only leaves the fields uncultivated, which is only a loss to the landlord" (Fei Xiaotong, "Peasant Life in China," 1939, English version).</p>
<p>This is by no means communist propaganda. Dr. Fei is a Kuomintang scholar, and his work is full of an absolutely objective research spirit. The rent he saw with his own eyes usually accounted for 40 to 80 percent of the total harvest, and sometimes even 90 percent. Therefore, Dr. Fei concluded: "In a nutshell, the root cause of the Chinese countryside is that the income of farmers cannot maintain the minimum standard of living. Frankly speaking, China's current real problem is the hunger of the people."</p>
<p>The foundation for the rise of the Chinese Communist Party is actually this widespread hunger among peasants throughout China. Driven by hunger, peasants joined the Chinese Communist Party in an endless stream, creating the CCP's enormous power today. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the degree of hatred the CCP holds for the landlord class. Although the CCP allowed the existence of rich peasants in 1935, declared protection for the petty bourgeoisie, and even recognized the existence of the landlord class in 1936, this policy was undoubtedly a temporary measure taken according to changes in the international situation. In the near future, the CCP will definitely want to eliminate the existence of the landlord class. Chinese landlords are also usurious capitalists, as well as investors in urban national commerce and industry. And their children are the backbone cadres of local governments and lower- and middle-ranking officers in the Kuomintang army. The CCP believes that the most powerful representatives of these landlords, national industrialists and capitalists, local governments, and the military within the Chongqing government are the "anti-communist trinity." In other words, they are He Yingqin, who controls the "military," Zhang Qun, who holds the "power," and Chen Lifu, who manipulates the "party" power. Shortly after I published "A View of the Chongqing Government," a left-leaning youth came to visit me and said the following:</p>
<p>"Although the 'military' directly belongs to the central government, the soldiers' salaries are collected from the poor farmers by the local government in the form of military rice. Therefore, the cadres in the army maintain a close relationship with the landlord class, which directly represents the local government. The constituent elements of the 'government,' especially the constituent elements of the local government, are all powerful local landlords and national industrialists and capitalists. Even the officials sent by the central government, due to 'reciprocity' and 'banquets and socializing,' develop close relationships with the local ruling groups. Thus, the principles for determining policies are naturally all in the interest of the landlord class and national industrialists and capitalists. The so-called 'party' is simply a place where the children of the landlord class temporarily show their skills in the interests of their class when they have not yet grabbed a lucrative position in the government."</p>
<p>Since the CCP observes the leadership of the Chongqing enemy government in this way, then it cannot but pay attention to the conspiracy behind the collusion between Chongqing and the United States. At the same time, the deeper the relationship between Chongqing and the United States, the deeper the relationship between the Soviet Union and the CCP. Of course, this is self-evident.

<h3>Strict Prohibition to Prevent Rice Circulation Actually Carried Out by Relevant Agencies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Since the implementation of emergency measures regarding rice, the price of rice in various places has been declining daily. However, as the opening of rice transport is just beginning, it is inevitable that a small number of merchants will take the opportunity to hoard, that military police along the way will create difficulties and extort money, and that local governments will restrict the circulation of rice on the pretext of maintaining local food supplies. To prevent this, the Ministry of Industry has separately notified various government agencies to strictly investigate and prohibit these practices, and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to consult the Military Affairs Commission and order various municipal governments to strictly prohibit such behavior in order to uphold the law.</p>
<h3>Recent Policy Overview of the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters from Kyoto at the ministry at 3 PM today, and gave a detailed account of the ministry's recent policy situation. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Promoting Agricultural and Forestry Work": Locusts and grasshoppers have appeared in the suburbs of Kyoto and in several sections along the Kyoto-Wuhan railway. The ministry has specially dispatched technical personnel, in cooperation with the Agricultural and Forestry Promotion Association and the Cooperative Business Association, to guide locust control work in various places. The plan to establish a training institute for aquatic product management personnel has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and work is being accelerated. There is a shortage of spring silkworm eggs. In order to coordinate the production of silkworm eggs, the ministry has conducted a detailed survey of the quantity of autumn silkworm eggs produced in various provinces this year, so as to facilitate overall planning and distribution.</p>
<p>"Investigating Private Factories in Shanghai and Distributing Electricity": Due to insufficient electricity, most private factories in Shanghai are at a standstill. In order to remedy this situation, the ministry will transport more than 1,000 tons of bituminous coal to Shanghai each month through the Coal Production Increase Steering Committee, which will be handed over to the Central China Hydropower Company to increase power generation for the exclusive use of various factories.</p>
<p>"Promoting the Increased Production of Various Private Coal Mines": All mines are expanding their projects and enriching their equipment, and are now working hard to extract coal from various mining areas. Under the implementation of supervision and guidance, the work is also quite active. The ministry is doing its best to assist in the export of coal from various mining areas. For example, it is contacting relevant parties regarding the mines in Longtan to arrange vehicles for transportation. The mines in Dongliu lack equipment and are crying out for help. The Coal Increase Steering Committee plans to purchase trucks to assist in transportation.</p>
<h3>Commander Chen of the Military Police Visits Hangzhou for Inspection</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Chen Gao, commander of the Central Military Police, previously visited Wuhu and Bengbu to inspect the affairs of the military police in various regions. After returning to Kyoto, he went to Hangzhou yesterday morning to inspect the current situation of the military police along the Kyoto-Shanghai-Hangzhou line.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Governor Ding Discusses Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Zhejiang Governor Ding Mocun, who recently came to Kyoto to report on his work, told reporters about the general situation of Zhejiang Province's recent policy: The situation in Zhejiang Province is more complicated than in other provinces, especially the problems of food, finance, and public security are more difficult. The current coping strategies can be roughly stated as follows: Regarding food, the fundamental solution is to increase production, and the temporary solution is to dredge sources. After taking office, I negotiated with the Central Reserve Bank for loans to purchase miscellaneous grains in the Kyoto-Wuhu area and wheat grains in the Xichang area to meet the current urgent needs. Regarding finance, we are actively working hard, but on the premise of not increasing the burden on the people. We plan to eliminate corruption in tax collection and collect in-kind taxes on mountain taxes, so as to enrich the treasury and achieve a balance of income and expenditure, and to implement an accounting system to facilitate consolidation. Regarding public security, the Red Bandits in Zhejiang Province have been quite rampant in recent months, which has a great impact on public security. After contacting relevant parties and obtaining their assistance, and after assigning certain troops to carry out suppression, there has been considerable progress. Many important cities and towns between Hangzhou and Wuxing have been recovered, and traffic between Hangzhou and Wuxing can be restored. In the future, we plan to advance gradually, hoping to gradually establish public security throughout the province.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters correspondent in England, Soviet troops paraded yesterday, displaying hundreds of German surrender flags (showing distinguished guests standing on the steps of Lenin's majestic mausoleum). When the parade of German surrender was near General Berzarin's reviewing platform and the viewing platform of Chairman Stalin, the audience suddenly fell silent. The strong sound of the army and civilians was no less than 100,000 people. At that time, the Soviet soldiers holding the German surrender flag suddenly turned to Lenin's mausoleum and threw the symbol of the German nation under the feet of General Berzarin under the full attention of Commander-in-Chief Stalin. Suddenly, cheers broke out, and the atmosphere of silence was broken. Among the spectators from the foreign ministries, Czech Prime Minister Fierlinger and many UN envoys were present and witnessed several Red Army teams led by famous generals such as Berzarin, Tolbukhin, Golovkin, and Malinovsky parade in formation. At the same time, General Rokossovsky rode a white horse back and forth to inspect the parade. The parade lasted about two hours and included various groups of Soviet armed forces. At the same time, a team of Polish troops who had participated in the Red Army's operations against Germany also participated in the parade.

<h3>Summer Hygiene Campaign Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday; Deputy Secretary-General Hu Gave Instructions on Behalf of the Mayor</h3>
<p>The city's Summer Hygiene Campaign officially opened yesterday (the 25th) at 9:00 AM at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Officials and guests attending the event included Mayor Zhou's representative, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Hu Zewu, Director of the Health Bureau Yuan Rongchang, Director of the Welfare Bureau Zhou Yuying, and representatives from various bureaus and offices, totaling over a thousand people. Members of the Shanghai West Youth Corps' Disciplinary Team were dispatched to assist in maintaining order. Deputy Secretary-General Hu delivered instructions, followed by Director Yuan's report on the preparations and the significance of the campaign. Subsequently, guest Mr. E.S. Tyau delivered a speech. After a little over an hour, the ceremony concluded, and the entire group marched in formation to the Qingnian Hui (YMCA) at Eight Immortals Bridge, where they dispersed.</p>
<p>Speech by Deputy Secretary-General Hu</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Hu Zewu's Speech on behalf of Mayor Zhou: "On the occasion of the opening of the Shanghai Special Municipality's Summer Hygiene Campaign, the Mayor is unable to attend in person due to official duties and has instructed me to represent him. The Summer Hygiene Campaign is held annually by each province and city according to central government regulations. Each time we hold it, we should earnestly review it, hoping that the results will be better each year.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have historically paid little attention to public health, leading to the scorn of foreigners and the moniker 'Sick Man of East Asia.' China has been a rural society with very few cities. In the future, as urban economies develop, cultures flourish, facilities are complete, and knowledge levels increase, we will naturally not be ridiculed by Westerners. The purpose of holding the Summer Hygiene Campaign is to awaken national awareness, led by the government, to promote the efforts of the entire nation.</p>
<p>I believe that future goals should focus on: first, cultivating hygienic habits and respecting public health ethics. Attention to hygiene is not just the concern of one person or one family, but of the entire nation. I sincerely hope that we can collectively create and promote public health movements."</p>
<p>Director Yuan's Report</p>
<p>This year's Summer Hygiene Campaign in this city was planned by this bureau in March and submitted to the municipal government for approval, after which preparations were immediately undertaken. According to the plan, in addition to holding the opening ceremony, it is also divided into two parts: hygiene activities and hygiene exhibitions. Regarding hygiene activities, the first day is Clean-Up Day, the second day is Fly-Swatting Day, and the third day is [omitted in original]. To gain the cooperation of the citizens for the above-mentioned activities, this bureau convened discussion meetings with the leaders of various Lianbao (Neighborhood Watch) units beforehand to ensure close communication. The hygiene exhibition includes departments such as physiological hygiene, nutritional hygiene, prevention of tuberculosis, oral hygiene, charts of infectious diseases, and other food hygiene topics. The scope of the exhibition is very broad, but this bureau has limited funds and a pressing timeline. Especially during this extraordinary period, with a shortage of materials, we cannot avoid being simple and crude. In addition, every evening from 7:00 PM at the Qingnian Hui at Eight Immortals Bridge, we will invite hygiene experts to give academic lectures, which are free for all citizens to attend, so that everyone can understand the meaning and purpose of public hygiene.</p>
<p>The completion of public health must be based on personal hygiene because the conditions for personal hygiene are relatively easy to achieve. Anyone who has received education can at least maintain personal hygiene. However, relying solely on narrow personal hygiene and neglecting family and social public health is still incomplete. If an infectious disease occurs, will you be exempt from infection simply because your personal hygiene is adequate? Therefore, the government must promote public hygiene so that all citizens can understand the importance of public hygiene.</p>
<p>The purpose of the hygiene campaign is to reduce disease and enable every citizen to have a healthy body to engage in the great cause of enriching the country and strengthening the people. To achieve this goal, everyone must take responsibility for transforming environmental hygiene: clearing road garbage, removing household waste, cleaning toilets and kitchens, and eradicating mosquitoes, flies, and rodents to prevent epidemics. This is merely the most important work of transforming environmental hygiene. This work will definitely not be accomplished simply by holding this hygiene campaign. The hygiene campaign is merely an opportunity to awaken the general public to truly understand the word "hygiene" and to promote the development of hygienic habits in everyone to ensure the safety of the public and reduce disease and mortality rates. However, this work is not a one-sided matter for the people, nor can it be done solely by the government. Cooperation is necessary to achieve the health of the people. I hope that after attending the conference, you will return and take the lead in earnestly promoting this, so that every citizen of Shanghai can achieve health and enjoy [omitted due to character error in original] , then can we consider this city's public health a success. This is my most sincere wish.</p>
<p>Exhibition and Lectures</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, the hygiene exhibition began. The venue was located at the Qingnian Hui at Eight Immortals Bridge and was divided into two areas. The internal materials included: The first room displayed: Market inspection, dairy product inspection, chemical inspection, processed products, pathological inspection (specimens), and oral hygiene. The second room displayed charts and diagrams related to school hygiene, child protection, nutrition and health, infectious diseases, tuberculosis prevention, leprosy, life statistics, actual vegetable specimens, disinfection and insecticidal equipment, quarantine hospitals, and other public hygiene matters, in great detail. Visitors from all walks of life were quite enthusiastic. Yesterday (the 25th) at 8:00 PM, the association, according to its scheduled plan, invited medical expert Dr. E.S. Tyau to give a lecture on "Leprosy" and to show slides related to public hygiene. It is also reported that tonight (the 26th), Dr. Wang Qizhang will lecture on "Tuberculosis Prevention."</p>

<h3>Fourth Phase of Coarse Grains; Prices Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Economic Bureau approved the Shanghai Coarse Grains Industry Association to organize the sale of affordable coarse grains, purchases have been very enthusiastic. This month, from the 26th to the 28th, is the "period" for the fourth phase of affordable coarse grain sales. Due to the recent rise in coarse grain prices and the high cost, the association, in accordance with the wishes of the economic authorities, has decided not to increase prices. The prices for the fourth phase will not be changed and will remain the same as in the third phase to benefit the people. The classification table is listed below:</p>
<p>Fourth Phase (from June 26th to June 28th) (Retail price per five Shanghai catties) Chongming red beans: 2.500 yuan. Benniu red beans: 9.500 yuan. Nanjing red beans: 9.500 yuan.

<h3>Foreign National Self-Defense Corps Established in Changning District</h3>
<p>The Foreign National Baojia (Neighborhood Unit) Self-Defense Corps of the Changning District Police Station, after more than a month of preparation, has been completed.

The meeting adjourned after taking a photograph at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>After Discontinuing Allocation Drafts, Banks and Firms Switch to Issuing Northern Notes; Banking Industry Hopes for Central Reserve Supply of Cash</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of cash in this city, the banking industry previously issued allocation drafts to supplement circulation, which was convenient but also created drawbacks. To ensure safety, the banking industry has notified all banks and firms that they will uniformly stop using allocation drafts from July 3rd. The reporter visited various responsible parties in the financial community to seek their opinions on the important matters that need to be handled and prepared for before and after the discontinuation of allocation drafts.</p>
<p>Significant Meaning of Discontinuing Allocation Drafts</p>
<p>It is indicated that the authorities considered it necessary to issue allocation drafts to adapt to the wartime monetary contraction policy, which was an inevitable process in wartime. However, after issuance, they were repeatedly transferred and flowed to other ports in large numbers. Many industries in this city also hold them without presenting them for payment. Moreover, counterfeit allocation drafts are emerging frequently, greatly affecting the financial system. The creditworthiness of the payers is also noteworthy. The primary purpose of issuing allocation drafts is to prevent inflation and effectively contract the currency. However, if allocation drafts are not presented for payment for a long time and continue to be issued, how can credit volatility be avoided? The financial authorities' decision to stop using allocation drafts has significant meaning.</p>
<p>Clearing and Storing Allocation Notes Before the Deadline</p>
<p>It is decided as scheduled that the allocation drafts, which are actually checks used by each bank and money exchange that are taken from the Central Reserve Shanghai Branch and the Silver Union Society cash storage, should be deposited by all industries in the city and outside merchants into the business bank or firm with which they do business, preferably before the deadline of July 3. If it is absolutely necessary to exceed the deadline, the banks and firms are advised to absolutely refuse acceptance, but if there is acceptance after the deadline, no allocation draft will be issued to customers, and from July 3, each bank or firm will only issue its own banker's draft to each customer, and in addition to the amount of cash to be paid, the banker's drafts should be developed with absolute caution, and the bearer of the draft will be limited to presentation within ten days. However, it is not appropriate for the amount of circulation of the banker's drafts to be too large, and it is deeply hoped that the Central Reserve Authority will grant the cash position required by each bank and firm as decided by the joint meeting of the banking industry as much as possible, and even allow the amount of cash requested recently by each member bank and firm of the two industrial associations. If the banking industry can issue one less banker's draft, its responsibility can be reduced by one point, and the banker's draft, because of the relationship of parallel lines, can only be submitted for exchange and transfer, but cannot be regarded as having the same effect as cash.</p>
<p>Cash Supply Possible Next Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money market tightened again, and the discontinuation of allocation drafts at the beginning of next month made many parties feel that there were more disadvantages than advantages to the banker's drafts of each bank and firm. The rediscount of 10,000 yuan is still around 2,000 yuan, and this trend may subside. The Central Reserve notified the banking industry that it is strictly forbidden for bank and firm employees to smuggle, and a new plan may be realized from the third day of next month, with each large and small bank and firm having a cash supply of 30,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>Is engaged in illegal transactions, and have already found solid evidence, and have requested from above to file a report with the financial inspection authorities for implementation of reporting and punishment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the Political Security Department Uncovers Major Criminal for Impersonating and Swindling</h3>
<p>Liu Wenwu, from Qingdao, 28 years old, resided in the pavilion room at 821 Haining Road. He had been adrift at sea for a long time. Recently, due to the extremely high cost of living in Shanghai, he could not maintain his livelihood, so he had the audacity to impersonate the "Special Shanghai Supervisory Office of the Political Security Department" to swindle and deceive, issue official ID cards indiscriminately, and defraud money for a living. This illegal major case has been thoroughly uncovered by the Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the department. The details of the investigation are described below:</p>
<p>Fraudulent Situation</p>
<p>Liu Wenwu, impersonating the "Special Shanghai Supervisory Office of the Political Security Department," privately printed official identification cards, indiscriminately appointing military ranks. In the short month from the start of the operation to the case being solved, he had already issued more than 30 fake official identification cards with the ranks of major, captain, lieutenant, etc. He also claimed that after the troops were officially formed, each person could receive six dou of rice and a living allowance of 15,000 yuan, and firearms could be issued. Therefore, many ignorant people were deceived and actively offered bribes in an attempt to be appointed.</p>
<p>How It Was Uncovered</p>
<p>After receiving a confidential report on June 7, the Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the Political Security Department, knowing that there was no "Special Shanghai Supervisory Office" within the organization, recognized it as impersonation and swindling. It immediately dispatched officers to investigate and, on the night, arrested Li Mingjin, the major director, and Wang Xiaoshan [name obscured due to possible misspelling], the lieutenant secretary, both of whom were appointed by Liu, at the British [name obscured due to possible misspelling] Village on Robison Road in West Shanghai. Based on the confessions of the arrested individuals, they rushed to 821 Haining Road and arrested Liu himself, seizing more than a dozen privately carved [symbols obscured due to character corruption/illegibility], as well as privately printed official identification cards, a [symbol obscured due to character corruption/illegibility] pistol, and documents such as the roster of [symbol obscured due to character corruption/illegibility] cases. All were taken to the district for interrogation.</p>
<p>Hoping for Whistleblowing</p>
<p>The institutions under the Political Security Department are established to protect politics, eliminate reactionaries, expose corruption, and maintain local order. The discipline is strict, and there are absolutely no out-of-bounds actions. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention in the future. If they discover any similar cases of impersonation and swindling, they can report and expose them to the Shanghai District of the First Bureau of the Political Security Department at 76 Fanwangdu Road, Shanghai, to avoid being deceived and to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3>This Period's Rationed Flour to Be Sold Starting Today; Number Two Flour Priced at 1,200 Yuan per Shanghai Catty</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau has recently decided that this period's rationed flour will be sold starting today (the 26th) for one week, ending on July 2nd. At that time, all retailers will uniformly sell one Shanghai catty of number two flour for 1,200 yuan of national currency based on the 48th integrated ration card, which is twice as much as before.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Continues to Appoint Special Gold Tax Committee Members</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has been ordered to levy a special gold tax and has established a special gold tax collection committee. The fixed number of committee members is eleven. In addition to the previously announced appointment of Sun Yaodong and nine others as committee members, it is reported that the bureau has continued to appoint Zhang Weiru and [name obscured due to possible misspelling] Weixu as committee members, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held at the Municipal Government on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Security Training Corps Holds Make-Up Inauguration Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Security Training Corps under the Shanghai Security Headquarters was established many years ago and has been mainly engaged in training cadres at all levels of the security team. In January of this year, in order to improve the quality of officers and soldiers, the Security Headquarters gathered many active-duty officers and soldiers from various teams under its command for retraining. At the same time, it selected 150 outstanding young people and provided them with officer training for more than one year. All students selected and officers and soldiers gathered held a make-up inauguration ceremony in the auditorium of the Municipal Security Headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month. In addition to the head of the corps, Han Shangying, and his academic and scientific instructors and all the staff, more than 30 officials including Chief of Staff of the Security Headquarters Xiong Jiandong and liaison officers from friendly countries attended. After the ceremony, the head of the corps first reported on the training progress over the past three months, followed by Chief of Staff Xiong giving instructions on behalf of Commander Zhou.
