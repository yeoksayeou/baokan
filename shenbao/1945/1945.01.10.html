<h3>以新覺悟新行動完成國家之統一　參戰紀念日陳代主席致詞</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　昨（九）日爲國府參戰二週年紀念日，值此大東亞戰爭進入決戰階段之時，首都民衆欣逢此歷史上偉大之一日，莫不熱情揚溢，全市商民住戶一律懸掛國旗，以誌紀念，衝要市街遍懸橫額，迎風招展，商店樹窗上加貼宣傳標語，繽紛滿目。各戲院並加快宣傳幻燈片等，期昂揚民衆參戰意識。午後並有青少年展開參戰日我國民節食運動，分赴夫子廟三山街新街口等區，廣泛勸導，宣傳增强戰意，全市充滿參戰之熱烈情緒，至爲深刻。</p>
<p>陳代主席致詞</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　今天是國民政府參加大東亞戰爭的兩週年紀念，本人就在這個重大意義的紀念日，再鄭重申明國民政府的決意。</p>
<p>東亞民族協力一致</p>
<p>猶憶去年十一月二日，本人就職代理國民政府主席之時，曾說過：中國國民黨在民國十三年改組，發表第一次全國代表大會宣言，對外政策自主取消不平等條約，國父逝世遺囑，亦促諸同志，務於最短期間，實現廢除不平等條約，用以昭示國人，此皆國父曁中國國民黨同志代表全國人民反對帝國主義，而求中國自由平等之一貫夙志。民國十四年七月，國民政府成立於廣州，即倡單獨對英，乃至去年一月九日參加大東亞戰爭，悉本反對帝國主義之旨趣，以求中國解放。自大東亞戰爭展開以後，英美雖屢經挫敗，對華之非法利益迄無取消之意圖，最近英國國務大臣，且在下院有英國無意放棄香港之宣示，可知英美帝國主義不打倒，中國以及全東亞絕無解放可能。國民政府於去年參加大東亞戰爭，爲正義而戰，爲解放而戰，更爲國父之大亞洲主義而戰，無論戰事如何推移，時局如何迫切，全國軍民決不動搖。今後東亞各民族應爲進一步之協力，以爭取最後之勝利。良以反對帝國主義爲國民政府之夙志，亦爲全國人民之決心，本此決意勇往邁進，成敗利鈍，在所不計。</p>
<p>英美對華陰謀重重</p>
<p>現在自本人的聲明以來，又一個多月了，這一個多月大東亞的戰事似乎更加迫切，可是我們的決意更因戰事迫切而加强。我們想想第一次歐戰的教訓，英美戰爭以後，不獨殖民地弱小國家受帝國主義的宰治，就是當時參戰的國家而力量較爲薄弱的，依然受英美的摒棄，倘使大東亞戰爭不能完成，大東亞和民族將萬刧不復，而中國也將萬刦不復</p>
<p>而且自英美以中國西南爲其空軍基地以後，更勾結共產黨，以挾持重慶，共產黨藉着英美援助，更加緊壓迫重慶，我們想想今後隨戰爭的推移中，中國將爲英美帝國主義與共產黨携手角逐之場，中國不止復爲國際帝國主義的殖民地，且將淪入於巴爾幹和波羅的海沿海小國的命運，邇時將無中華民國，更無所謂重慶政權，中國果將萬刧不復，而大東亞各民族，也將萬刧不復。</p>
<p>一往直前爭取勝利</p>
<p>我們爲着保衛大東亞民族的解放，爲着保衛中國既得之獨立自由，爲着保衛中華民國人民的生存，爲着保衛三民主義之實施，今後祗有一往直前，協同大東亞各民族爭取最後之勝利，歐洲的戰局，因德國的努力，可改觀了。大東亞戰爭的前途，更有着無限樂觀。前綫各民族，都本於保衛既得的解放自由，努力奮戰，我們很期望重慶的人民和同志，洞察第一次歐戰的教訓，警惕於現在的壓迫，更戒慎於將來英美帝國主義和共產黨的分割，中國一致奮起，求得中國之真正獨立自由，我們正在努力邁進，來配合我全國同胞和同志們的新覺悟和新行動，以完成國家之和平統一。</p>
<p>中國自參戰以來，兩年內在總力戰中，同胞們已給予大東亞戰爭不少物力人力的貢獻，一面勇猛精進，一面刻苦耐勞，今後更該應時局的緊迫作奮進的努力，國民政府對於國民們的努力，非常欽敬，今日在此紀念日，應致其感謝之忱，國家之存亡，不是有待於天命，而有待於自己的努力，親愛的同志們，同胞們：一齊奮起，完成中國的獨立自由　！</p>
<h3>中日青少年舉行交歡會</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電，首都青少年與亞總奮起運動實踐委員會主辦之中日青少年交歡大會，於九日下午三時假新運會大禮堂隆重舉行，參加中日青少年代表各機關代表百餘人，林總藍許副教育長蒞臨指導，三時正行禮如檥後，先報告　備經過及大會舉行意義，繼由中日青少年代表致詞，至五時許散會。</p>
<h3>日軍航空隊　猛攻敵艦船　菲海面戰果正擴大中</h3>
<p>菲律賓基地九日中央社電　菲律賓方面日軍航空隊，自敵艦船羣侵入蘇魯海以來，爲粉碎敵侵攻呂宋島之野心，毅然奮起展開猛烈之攻防戰。又於七日夕刻，發覺敵艦艇羣之主力，自明多羅島西方海面，向馬尼刺海面北上中，日全機乃組成特攻隊，作壯烈無比之衝撞攻擊，戰果正在擴大中。但敵機接近仁牙因地區，敵艦船羣自八日晨以來，似逐漸向西方海面退避，日軍之猛攻，至八日晚依然繼續中。於馬尼刺西方海面起火之敵艦船，到處可見，目下奮威殺敵之攻擊戰，已達最高潮。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地九日中央社電　日航空部隊七日晨空襲呂宋島西方海面敵運輸船團，擊沉其大型運輸船一艘，重創大型運輸船一艘。又八日黎明後轟沉敵大型運輸船一艘。</p>
<h3>日陸軍省上奏　各勇士功勳</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日陸軍省一月九日發表：陸軍少佐宮島滿等四名，陸軍大尉齊藤敢以下六名，以及陸軍軍曹森澤滿，去年十月中間空戰之際，建立殊勳，業由軍司令宮及南方陸軍最高指揮官分別授與感狀，頃更上奏天皇陛下。</p>
<h3>澳洲海陸空軍參加非島作戰</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　康白拉訊：澳洲代理首相福特，六日宣稱：澳洲海陸空三軍，均已參加菲律賓作戰，担任重要任務。</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　海通社訊：雪梨消息，澳洲代理內閣總理福特宣稱：澳洲必須以二五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇金元之糧食，供應太平洋方面之美軍，今年供給美國之小麥，較去年之數量爲少</p>
<h3>襲漢敵機　被擊毀九架</h3>
<p>漢口九日中央社電　六日下午渝美空身P40P47P51等型機，累計四十架，兩次來襲武漢地區，日軍以識烈之防空砲火，擊毀其中九架（其中四架似已擊落），其餘者被擊退，詳細戰果，現正調查中。</p>
<h3>B29型數十架　昨侵襲東京　敵機襲幌延島未逞</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　由馬里亞納而來之敵B29型機約數十架，九日下午二時起侵入日本關東及中部地區，其大半於東京地區投下炸彈，燒夷彈，但日方損失極輕微，敵機連日軍防空部隊之熾烈邀擊，三時許即向南方脫逃，關於邀擊之戰果，刻在調查中，然於東京上空起火及脫落編隊之敵機，均爲衆目共睹矣。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　敵艦約七艘於六日下午三時許砲擊幌延島之一部陣地，即爲日守軍擊退。七日更曾有敵B24型機二架侵入該地區，實行盲炸，但因日制空部隊之邀擊，致負傷逃去，日方並無損失。</p>
<h3>日國民運動　積極展開</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　有力之國民運動，即國民再組織之問題，此乃日本目下政界之一大課題，而此課題又在逐次表面化，今日之日本所建之戰局，已達最艱酷之階段，際此國家興亡之關頭，國民每人皆願一戰到底，乃發起國民運動。此次國民再組織運動之氣焰，與既往不同，昔者多由官方提倡，而今者則純出乎民間政治等團體之自動。然關於國民所翹望之政治再加緊一節，究如何使之實現，其意見非無相違之處，然於表面活動之組織，計有翼贊，翼政，翼壯三團體，該三團體之意向大體如次：翼贊會因係公事　社，且爲國民組織之主體，故無純粹統一之意見，以大勢觀，翼政，翼壯，似有互相運結之傾向，因此，現在無地方支部之翼政會，似欲於地方新本支部組織翼壯會一組織，乃以建川氏爲團長之「同志結社」，然以今日之政界情形，頗難貫澈原來方針，故橋部長首腦先行辭去，而由緒方翼贊會副總裁兼任翼壯團長，然此乃臨時措置。至於東京翼壯團之幹部，不希其首腦部有舊黨派政派之人物，然而欲決此問題，須有能連擊翼壯翼政使之爲協力體制之人物，故欲獲此人物，尚須若干時日。翼政方面之翼壯解體論，似已失敗，故今後之翼壯，將以獨自之青壯中堅運動爲主，向前發展。此次日本國民運動中之活動，頗能使翼政，翼贊，翼壯之協力關係倍爲增强，頗值期待。</p>
<h3>第三六六次　行政院會議</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　行政院九日舉行三六六次會議，出席陳公博·周佛海·梅思平·褚民誼·葉蓬·凌霄·李聖五·陳君慧·傅式　·林柏生·沈爾喬·陸潤之，列席本院副秘書長巫蘭溪·薛逢元，清鄉事務局局長汪曼　·社會福利部次長黃慶中·南京特別市市長周學昌，主席陳院長，秘書長周隆庠，報告事項（略）。討論事項：（一）院長交議，據農策會陳兼委員長呈，擬請修正本會組織規程，謹擬具修正條文草案，決議交秘書處召集實部農策會會同審查。（二）院長交議，據司法行政部陳部長呈，擬設置江蘇高等法院泰縣分院分署·泰縣地方法院檢察署·及看守所等，請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議准予設置，并呈報國府備案，咨司法院備查。（三）院長交議，據梅內長丁社福部長會呈，爲擬訂國民義務勞動法草案，請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議修正通過，呈中政會。任免事項：（一）院長提，安徽省政務廳廳長胡澤吾·教育廳廳長嚴恩祚·建設廳廳長彰望軾·警務處處長滿其蔚，均另有任用，擬予免職，並擬任命范諤爲安徽省政務廳廳長，許惕生爲教育廳廳長，鐘任壽爲建設廳廳長，伍麟趾爲警務處處長案，決議通過。（二）院長提，兼物統會委員吳頌　擬免兼職，並擬特派林柏生兼物統會委員案，決議通過。（餘略）</p>
<h3>渝智識階級總動員難實現</h3>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　據到達當地情報稱：渝方宣傳使知識青年從軍運動，其後，遲遲不進，欲將當初十萬擴大爲四十萬之目標，現僅來得四萬人而已。渝當局爲充其數字，乃擬徵募由桂林逃出之學生，然而仍難如願，故渝知識階級總動員運動，將受一大打擊云。</p>
<h3>渝定期召開中執委會議</h3>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據合衆社重慶電：渝國民黨中央執行委員會，常務委員八日議決，決定於七月六日舉行黨大會。按此次大會爲自一九三八年於漢口舉行以來之首次云。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>重振廉潔運動</h3>
<p>官吏是治理國事，衣率羣倫的政治領導者，如果大多數官吏不能盡職，則就不足以治理國事，不足衣率羣倫，自然不能「齊家治國平天下」了。所以爲使政治日趨正軌，廉潔運動實不可不予以重視。</p>
<p>但是，官場風紀之所以不振，行政效能之所以低下，必有種種政治與經濟上的根源。所以廉潔運動的推　，決不能單憑一句口號或是訴之於道德與倫理的觀念，即能望其臻效，而必須在經濟與政治上嚴訂種種妥善的辦法，使從政者必能盡職，不敢貪汚，且無從貪汚，而後廉潔的政風始能確立。於此，吾人試獻議幾點原則，以作推進與達成廉潔運動的張本。</p>
<p>首先是應當安定公務人員的生活。管子說：「衣食足而後知榮辱」。俗語說，枵腹不能從公。所以，安定公務人員的生活乃是實現廉潔與提高辦事效能的首要前提。大多數的公務人員，不論是上自巨宦，下至巡警，如果都不能以俸祿所入仰事俯畜，甚或連個人的肚子都裝不飽，則政治決無由清明，國事決無由改善。也許有人會說，現在歲出浩大，財政困難，提高公務人員的待遇非不知其重要，但力有不逮。　一說似是而非。我們敢於斷言，如果政治上能够真的做到弊絕風清的程度，則各項稅收的中飽剔除，歲入定能有鉅額之驚人的突增，區區一點公務人員薪津的增加那會還成問題？這是一。第二，推進廉潔運動必須强化政務與人事的管理。現在許多行政與公用事業機關的行政與人事的管理，實在是太鬆懈，太不合理了。以致許多下級的人員得以爲非作歹，甚且勾結上司，上下交征利，視公務如兒戲，視小民如草芥，這是最要不得，而亟需求其改進的。第三，在生活有保障。政務與人事的管理上了軌道以後，政治上還須求其重法紀，嚴賞罰，使公務人員奉公守法，而不敢以身試法，則廉潔風紀的樹立庶幾有望。第四，廉潔風紀的樹立，尤須在上者之「以身作則」，而後在下者始能風行草偃，否則「上樑不正下樑歪」，整個風紀決無由振肅的。最後，則厲行戰時生活，嚴禁奢侈頹惰之風，限制徵逐　食，减少浪費，消除貪汚的動機，亦爲推進廉潔運動過程中所必不可少之圖。蓋今日貪汚之所以盛行，環境之引誘實亦爲厲之階，然奢侈浪費，不獨直接耗消物資，抑且養成頹廢之風，實非戰爭時期所應有，故須予以根絕，能如此則廉潔政治之建立必較輕而易舉也。願各方勉之。</p>
<h3>緬甸前綫日軍　作果敢奇襲　挺身隊到處深入敵陣</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地九日中央社電　緬甸前綫日軍磯川特別挺身隊，於激戰之前綫，到處深入敵陣，震驚敵軍，並繼續敢行奇襲，收得極大戰果。爰十二月初句，挺身隊潛入卡來瓦附近地區敵陣，作果敢之奇襲，殺傷敵將兵多人，並鹵獲戰車一輛及其他各種兵器多數。又另一日軍挺身隊，自十二月二十八日以來，奇襲康巴爾北方五公里敵砲兵陣地，砲毀廟幕五處，大汽車三輛，並殺傷敵將士十五名後歸還。</p>
<h3>港總督府禁止使用敵性通貨</h3>
<p>香港九日中央社電　香港日總督府前會通令禁止使用港幣及舊法幣等敵性通貨，然最近鑒於此種敵性通貨竟有暗盤買賣情事，影響物價非淺，此次特再普遍禁止持有敵性通貨，以期一掃流弊，八日明令布關於上項管區內通貨規則之改正規則，而於即日開始實施。又總督部爲體恤一般持有此種敵性通貨市民，決定自一月八日起，約一個月間，於各銀行實施敵性通貨特別兌換云。</p>
<h3>拓展新運完遂戰爭　林總監廣播勗勉國人</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　中國青少年總監林柏生氏，爲參戰二週年紀念，特以「拓展新運，完遂戰爭」爲題，舉行廣播，勗勉國人要遵奉領袖實踐新國民運動之遺訓，以担負與華保亞之使命。茲錄原詞如次：今年一月九日是我國參戰二週年紀念日，記得去年一月九日領袖曾扶病主持參戰周年紀念儀式，並諄諄訓示國民，努力增加生產·肅正思想·保障治安的工作，今年今日，我們舉行參戰二週年紀念，領袖雖已去世，而其精神還在領導着我們後死同志，全國國民於哀慟之餘，益感責任之重大。我們要把全部力量貢獻給國家，貢獻給東亞，把國家復興起來，把東亞鞏固起來，才能對得起領袖在天之靈。</p>
<p>作戰到底爭取自由</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發已經三年，我國參戰也已經二年。這次戰爭是東亞十萬萬民衆團結起來，清算英美侵略主義的戰爭，是百年來我們飽受敵人英美帝國主義者壓迫欺凌，起而要求自由解放的戰爭。我們要生存，我們要回復東亞人的東亞，我們要爭取國家民族的獨立自由，所以我們要戰爭，要戰爭到底。從戰爭開始，賴盟邦將士在前方奮勇克敵，已經奠定勝利的甚礎，一直到今天戰爭過了三個年頭，戰爭愈加熾烈，已到了決戰的階段。</p>
<p>敵人幻夢完全粉碎</p>
<p>敵人在寒班島登陸以後，勝利幻想縈　敵人的周圍，以爲日本海軍的主力已經擊破，在中國沿海登陸而至直到日本本土，真是易如反掌，可是台灣海面戰役之後，繼之菲律賓海面戰役，戰爭的事實，粉碎了敵人的幻想，敵人參謀本部作戰計劃的估計，不得不自動撞回修正，這不過第一次的打擊，第一次的修正而已。此後的打擊此後的修正，將兩次三次直至敵人不得不放棄其再侵略的迷夢爲止。同胞們，我們要堅定必勝的信念，這幾年來戰爭的結果，已經證明必勝信念不是幻想，不是空談，而是有百分之百事實的根據。（未完）</p>

<h3>紀念參戰兩周年　舉行民衆大會　各機關長官出席致詞</h3>
<p>昨（九）日爲我國參戰兩週年紀念日，本市各界因鑒於我國參戰之意義至爲重大，爲表示全市民衆對大東亞戰爭之必勝信念起見，在市宣傳處主特下，於是日上午假座靜要寺路大光阻戲院舉行「中國參戰二週年紀念上海市民衆祝捷大會」，計到各機關長官市府吳秘書長，保安司令部熊參謀長，中央海軍學校姜校長，市黨部劉主任委員，敎育局戴局長，保甲處顧處長，宣傳處梁處長，盟邦大使館上海事務所松平報道部長，市商會袁理事長，暨各機關各公團軍警保甲靑少年等代表二千餘人</p>
<p>袁履登詞　十時正，奏樂開會，由主席團代表袁履登領導行禮如儀後，宣讀國民政府參戰布吿，致開會辭：略謂：「今天爲我國參戰兩週年紀念，上海市各界在此舉行祝捷大會，諸位踴羅參加，至爲興奮。大東亞戰爭是全東亞民族解放的戰爭，我國的參戰是大東亞戰爭必勝的基礎，我國這一次的參戰，是爲了國家的獨立，爲了東亞的共榮，更爲謀求子孫的幸福，所以我們應該把每一個人的力量精神集中起來，貢獻於戰爭的完遂，解放的完成。二年以來，盟邦將士在前綫的赫赫戰果，已使我們堅定必勝的信念，目前已臨決戰階段，我們上海市民惟有盡後方民衆的責任，加倍努力，以蘄致光明之早日到來，謹以此意作爲今天的開會辭，並祝前方的勝利」</p>
<p>熊劍東詞　繼由保這司令部熊參謀長代表演講：略謂「當此參戰二週年紀念日我們對盟軍前綫奮戰的精神，應表敬意，我們爲了爭取自由，反抗敵美的束縛，我們應在陳代主席領導之下，繼續汪故主席的遺志，與盟邦同生共死以全副精神置於決戰第一上，積極求國家之和平與統一，把整個的力量，貢獻於保衛東亞，解放東亞，期早日獲得勝利。」</p>
<p>姜西園詞　繼由中央海軍學校校長姜西園演講略謂：「今年是大東亞戰爭的決戰年一，我們應該握住這必勝的機會，求努力的奮發，在大東亞的最前綫有着盟邦海陸空軍，以忠勇的精神，與敵美　開憶大的血載，可是在後方的大東亞人民，也應該本着這精神與前方的將士們合作，來握住這最後五分鏡的機會，共赴艱。」</p>
<p>松平致詞　繼由日本大使館上海事務所松平報道部長，以我國國語演講，略謂：「今天是中國參戰二週年紀念，我以非常興奮的心情來參加這次盛會。自從大東亞戰爭發動以來，中國國民政府迭决發表聲明，羅與日本同甘共苦，同生共死，日本民衆對中國有了更進一步的襲識，中日兩國的關係也因此而更爲密切。中日同盟條約締結後，日本因爲要使中國完成主抓獨立，領土完整起見，所以將所有租界相總交還。不過中國要求眞正的主權獨立與領土完整，則有待於大東亞戰爭的勝利。敵美的戰鬥已經一天比一天的利害起來，而英國對於緬甸印度，非但不承認其獨立，反而進攻他們，由此我們可以知道英美有把我們東亞各國都佔爲已有的野心，使東亞各國都淪爲英美奴隸的企圖，所以我們必須要聯合大東亞各民族，共同擊滅英美。現在日本以菲律賓島作爲基地，以勇敢的青年，組織特別攻擊隊，把自已的肉體當作炸彈，來擊毀敵　敵機，這積精神，我想足以使中國民衆相與奮起的，我們只要抱定宗旨，竭力奮戰，大東亞戰爭的勝利，總必定能夠獲得，希望諸位爲國家爲東亞而加倍努力。」演講既畢，即全體肅立宣讀向陳代主席及向盟邦小磯首相致敬電文。最後高呼口號而散。</p>
<h3>新聞協會滬分會　舉行演講會</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會，特於昨（九）日下午五時假靜安寺路大光明大戲院，舉行參戰紀念演講會，出席該會理事長陳彬龢，常務理事尾坂與市。陳日平。許力求。金雄白。褚保街。袁殊。森山喬。來賓新申報編輯局長日高請磨瑳，由陳彬龢主席，總幹事魯風報吿開會意義，繼由新聞報副社長陳日平氏演講，詞意警惕，聽者動容，歷半小時許。演講畢，即開始放映「英雄美人」，於八時始畢。茲錄演詞於后。</p>
<p>陳日平演講詞　今天是我國參加大東亞戰爭二周年紀念日，鄙人有所感想和希望，謹向各位討論。第一，大東亞戰爭必須完遂。回想英美勢力擴張在東亞的時期，無論在政治上，經濟上，莫不施用其侵略主義，尤其我國目從與英國發生鴉片戰爭後，　受蹂躪，忍辱含　，已有一百多年，至今鴉片遺毒，在我國境內一直未能根絕，言之實堪痛心。又如美國，對於華僑限制入境，歧視人種，公然不平等待遇，請問此種種對待吾人的態度，稍具血性的人，能否忍受，更依租界爲根據，魚肉我人民，以治外法權爲護符，侵蝕我權益，蔑視國體，侮辱民族，家國之恥，莫此爲甚。况且壓力愈大，反動力愈强，我們所受到的壓力，實在旣大且重，所以我們爲圖民族生存，國家復興，政府毅然參戰，民衆一致後援，這種力量是比任何力量來得强大，不管他人的壓力如何，我們只要堅持到底，億萬一心，敢說我們目的，一定可以達到，我們的使命，一定可以完成，因此大東亞戰爭必須完遂。必須檢肅和協力，在戰時體制下，我們必須注意兩事。就是安定民生和加强實力，汪主席於去年一周紀念，曾有明確的實示，其要點有二：（一）肅正思想，（二）保障治安，（三）增加生產。年來政府當局，雖加努力，但還不能說盡如人意。同時人民方面，對於暴利主養和享樂主義，不能消滅，致於全局，實有不少的影響。我們要明瞭，國家應以民爲本，民衆當以國爲先，要從大我着想，毋爲自利是圖，尤其在當今最後的關頭，決勝的階段，政府和民衆，民衆和政府，必須團結起來，一致對外，才能够達到國泰民安的途徑。故人人必須痛加自肅，舉凡有碍國計民生的一切行爲，務必剷除，上下協力，共和參戰國民應有的義務。</p>
<p>我們認識參戰的偉大意義，同時堅定信心，必須完遂，同心合力，勇猛奮鬥，則最後的勝利，必屬於我，這是毫無疑異的結果，也是我們所必須達到的地步。</p>

<h3>Completing National Unification with New Awareness and New Action: Speech by Acting Chairman Chen on the War Participation Commemoration Day</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday (the 9th) was the second anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. As the Greater East Asia War enters its decisive phase, the people of the capital are overjoyed to celebrate this great historical day. All businesses and residents throughout the city are hanging national flags to mark the occasion. Important streets are covered with banners fluttering in the wind, and shop windows are decorated with propaganda slogans, creating a colorful scene. Theaters are also speeding up the screening of propaganda slides to boost public awareness of the war effort. In the afternoon, young people launched a "War Participation Day National Frugality Movement," going to areas such as Fuzimiao, Sanshan Street, and Xinjiekou to widely encourage and promote the strengthening of war spirit. The whole city was filled with a fervent pro-war atmosphere, deeply felt.</p>
<p>Speech by Acting Chairman Chen</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Today marks the second anniversary of the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War. On this day of great significance, I solemnly reiterate the National Government's determination.</p>
<p>East Asian Nations Unite in Cooperation</p>
<p>Recalling November 2nd of last year, when I assumed office as Acting Chairman of the National Government, I stated that the Chinese Kuomintang, when reorganized in 1924, issued the declaration of the First National Congress, advocating an independent foreign policy to abolish unequal treaties. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will also urged comrades to realize the abolition of unequal treaties in the shortest possible time to show the nation. These all represent the consistent aspiration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang to oppose imperialism on behalf of the entire Chinese people and seek freedom and equality for China. In July 1925, the National Government was established in Guangzhou and advocated a stand against Britain alone, and even the participation in the Greater East Asia War on January 9th of last year, was based on the purpose of opposing imperialism and seeking China's liberation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although Britain and the United States have suffered repeated setbacks, they still have no intention of abandoning their illegal interests in China. Recently, the British Secretary of State even declared in the House of Commons that Britain has no intention of abandoning Hong Kong. It can be seen that without defeating British and American imperialism, there is no possibility of liberation for China and all of East Asia. The National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War last year to fight for justice, for liberation, and even more for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. No matter how the war progresses or how urgent the situation becomes, the military and civilians of the whole country will not waver. In the future, all East Asian nations should cooperate further to strive for the final victory. Indeed, opposing imperialism is the long-cherished aspiration of the National Government and the determination of the entire Chinese people. Based on this determination, we will move forward bravely, regardless of success or failure.</p>
<p>British and American Conspiracies Against China are Numerous</p>
<p>Now, more than a month has passed since my statement. The war in Greater East Asia seems to be even more pressing, but our determination is strengthened by the urgency of the war. Let us think about the lessons of the First World War. After the war between Britain and the United States, not only were colonial and small countries subjected to imperialist rule, but even those countries that participated in the war and were weaker were still rejected by Britain and the United States. If the Greater East Asia War cannot be completed, Greater East Asia and its nations will be doomed, and China will also be doomed.</p>
<p>Moreover, since Britain and the United States used southwestern China as their air force base, they have colluded with the Communist Party to hold Chongqing hostage. With the support of Britain and the United States, the Communist Party has intensified its oppression of Chongqing. We must consider that in the future, as the war progresses, China will become a battleground for British and American imperialism and the Communist Party to compete. China will not only become a colony of international imperialism again, but will also be reduced to the fate of the small countries along the Balkans and the Baltic Sea. At that time, there will be no Republic of China, and even the Chongqing regime will be meaningless. China will indeed be doomed, and all the nations of Greater East Asia will also be doomed.</p>
<p>March Forward Bravely to Seize Victory</p>
<p>In order to defend the liberation of the Greater East Asian nations, to defend China's acquired independence and freedom, to defend the survival of the people of the Republic of China, and to defend the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, we must only move forward bravely in the future, working with all East Asian nations to strive for the final victory. The situation in Europe has changed due to Germany's efforts. The future of the Greater East Asia War is even more optimistic. All nations on the front line are striving to fight based on defending their acquired liberation and freedom. We sincerely hope that the people and comrades in Chongqing will understand the lessons of the First World War, be vigilant against the current oppression, and be even more cautious about the future division by British and American imperialism and the Communist Party. China must rise up together to seek China's true independence and freedom. We are working hard to move forward in coordination with the new awareness and new actions of our compatriots and comrades throughout the country to complete the peaceful unification of the country.</p>
<p>Since China's participation in the war, in the past two years of total war, our compatriots have contributed considerable material and human resources to the Greater East Asia War. While being courageous and diligent, they have also been hardworking and resilient. In the future, they should make even more striving efforts in response to the urgency of the situation. The National Government has great respect for the efforts of the people. Today, on this commemorative day, we should express our heartfelt gratitude. The survival of the country does not depend on fate but on our own efforts. Dear comrades, compatriots, let us rise up together to complete China's independence and freedom!</p>

<h3>Dozens of B-29s Attacked Tokyo Yesterday; Enemy Planes Failed to Attack Horonobu Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – About dozens of enemy B-29 planes from the Mariana Islands invaded the Kanto and central regions of Japan from 2:00 PM on the 9th. Most of them dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in the Tokyo area, but Japanese losses were extremely minimal.

<h3>Japanese National Movement Actively Unfolds</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The powerful national movement, that is, the issue of national reorganization, is currently a major topic in Japanese political circles, and this topic is gradually surfacing. Japan's current war situation has reached its most difficult stage. At this critical moment for the nation's survival, every citizen is willing to fight to the end, hence the launch of the national movement. The momentum of this national reorganization movement is different from the past. In the past, it was mostly promoted by the government, but now it is purely voluntary from civilian political and other groups. However, regarding how to realize the political strengthening that the people are looking forward to, there are differences of opinion. However, in terms of surface activities, there are three organizations: the Assistance Association, the Assistance Administration, and the Assistance Youth. The intentions of these three organizations are roughly as follows: The Assistance Association is a public affairs organization and the main body of national organization, so there is no purely unified opinion. From a broader perspective, the Assistance Administration and the Assistance Youth seem to be inclined to cooperate with each other. Therefore, the Assistance Administration, which currently has no local branches, seems to want to organize the Assistance Youth, an organization headed by Mr. Takekawa, as its new local branches. However, given the current political situation, it is difficult to implement the original policy. Therefore, the heads of the Bridge Department first resigned, and Mr. Ogata, Vice President of the Assistance Association, concurrently served as the head of the Assistance Youth, but this is a temporary measure. As for the cadres of the Tokyo Assistance Youth, they do not want their leaders to be figures from old parties and political factions. However, to solve this problem, there must be someone who can connect the Assistance Youth and Assistance Administration and make them a cooperative system. Therefore, it will take some time to find such a person. The Assistance Administration's theory of dissolving the Assistance Youth seems to have failed. Therefore, in the future, the Assistance Youth will focus on its own youth and middle-aged core movement and develop forward. The activities in this Japanese national movement are quite capable of enhancing the cooperative relationship between the Assistance Administration, the Assistance Association, and the Assistance Youth, which is quite promising.</p>

<h3>Total Mobilization of Intellectuals in Chongqing Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to information arriving locally, the movement to encourage educated youth to join the army in Chongqing has been slow to progress.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Revitalizing the Integrity Movement</h3>
<p>Officials are the political leaders who govern the country and lead the masses. If most officials cannot fulfill their duties, they are not sufficient to govern the country, nor can they lead the masses. Naturally, they cannot "manage their families, govern the country, and bring peace to the world." Therefore, in order to make politics move towards the right track, the integrity movement must be given importance.</p>
<p>However, the reasons for the decline in officialdom's discipline and the low efficiency of administration must have various political and economic roots. Therefore, the promotion of the integrity movement cannot be expected to achieve results by relying solely on a slogan or appealing to moral and ethical concepts. Instead, it must strictly establish various appropriate measures economically and politically, so that those in politics can fulfill their duties, dare not be corrupt, and have no way to be corrupt. Only then can an honest political atmosphere be established. Here, we will try to offer a few principles to serve as the foundation for promoting and achieving the integrity movement.</p>
<p>First, the lives of civil servants should be stabilized. Guanzi said, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know honor and disgrace." As the saying goes, an empty stomach cannot serve the public. Therefore, stabilizing the lives of civil servants is the primary prerequisite for realizing integrity and improving work efficiency. If most civil servants, from high-ranking officials to patrolmen, cannot support their families with their salaries, or even cannot fill their own stomachs, then politics will never be clear and national affairs will never be improved. Perhaps some will say that the current annual expenditures are huge and finances are difficult, and raising the salaries of civil servants is known to be important, but the resources are insufficient. This statement is seemingly correct but actually wrong. We dare to assert that if politics can truly achieve a degree of eliminating corruption and malpractice, then the interception of various tax revenues will be eliminated, and the annual income will definitely have a huge and amazing increase. How could the mere increase in the salaries of civil servants still be a problem? This is the first point. Second, the integrity movement must strengthen the management of political affairs and personnel. Currently, the management of administrative and personnel affairs in many administrative and public service agencies is really too lax and unreasonable, so that many lower-level personnel can do whatever they want, and even collude with their superiors, exploiting the public interest for private gain, treating public service as a child's play, and treating ordinary people like grass. This is the most unacceptable thing and urgently needs to be improved. Third, after life is guaranteed and the management of political affairs and personnel is on track, politics must also demand a heavy emphasis on law and discipline, and strict rewards and punishments, so that civil servants obey the law and dare not test the law, and then the establishment of honest discipline can be hoped for. Fourth, the establishment of integrity discipline requires even more the "setting an example" of those in positions of authority, and then those below can follow suit. Otherwise, "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked," and the entire discipline will never be revitalized. Finally, the implementation of wartime living, strictly prohibiting the atmosphere of luxury and decadence, limiting extravagance and food, reducing waste, and eliminating the motives for corruption are also indispensable plans in the process of promoting the integrity movement. Today's rampant corruption is, in fact, largely due to the temptations of the environment. Extravagance and waste not only directly consume materials but also cultivate a decadent atmosphere, which is not appropriate during wartime. Therefore, it must be eradicated. If we can do this, the establishment of honest politics will be easier. May all parties strive for it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on the Burmese Front Carry Out Daring Surprise Attacks; Suicide Squads Penetrate Enemy Lines Everywhere</h3>
<p>Burmese Frontline Base, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Isokawa Special Suicide Squad of the Japanese Army on the Burmese Front penetrated deep into enemy lines in the fiercely fought frontline, shocking the enemy and continuing to carry out daring surprise attacks, reaping great battle results. At the beginning of December, the suicide squad sneaked into enemy positions near Kaleva, carrying out daring surprise attacks, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers, and capturing one tank and many other weapons. Another Japanese army suicide squad, since December 28th, carried out a surprise attack on an enemy artillery position five kilometers north of Kambaal, destroying five temple tents and three large trucks, and killing or wounding 15 enemy soldiers before returning.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Governor's Office Prohibits the Use of Hostile Currency</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Governor's Office in Hong Kong previously issued a notice prohibiting the use of hostile currencies such as Hong Kong dollars and old legal tender. However, recently, in view of the fact that such hostile currencies are actually being traded on the black market, which has had a significant impact on prices, it has now widely prohibited the possession of hostile currencies again in order to eliminate malpractices. On the 8th, a clear order was issued regarding the revised regulations on currency rules within the above-mentioned jurisdiction, which began to be implemented on the same day. In order to sympathize with the general public who hold such hostile currencies, the Governor's Office has decided to implement a special exchange of hostile currencies at various banks for about one month starting from January 8th.</p>
<h3>Expanding the New Movement and Completing the War: Director-General Lin Broadcasts Encouragement to the Nation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Ninth (Central News Agency dispatch): Lin Baisheng, Director-General of the China Youth Corps, in commemoration of the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, delivered a broadcast titled "Expanding the New Movement and Completing the War." He encouraged the people to follow the late Leader's teachings on the New Life Movement, shouldering the mission of resisting American and British aggression in Asia. The original text is as follows: Today, January 9th, marks the second anniversary of our country's participation in the war. I remember that on January 9th last year, the Leader, despite being ill, presided over the anniversary ceremony and earnestly instructed the nation to strive to increase production, rectify thought, and ensure public safety. Today, as we commemorate the second anniversary of our participation in the war, although the Leader has passed away, his spirit continues to guide us, his surviving comrades. The people of the whole country, amidst their grief, feel an even greater sense of responsibility. We must dedicate all our strength to the country, to East Asia, to revitalize the country, to consolidate East Asia, only then can we be worthy of the Leader's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>Fighting to the End for Freedom</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and two years since our country joined the war. This war is the unity of hundreds of millions of people in East Asia to settle accounts with Anglo-American aggression. It is a war to demand freedom and liberation after a century of oppression and bullying by our enemies, the Anglo-American imperialists. We want to survive, we want to restore East Asia to the people of East Asia, we want to strive for national independence and freedom, so we want war, we want war to the end. Since the beginning of the war, thanks to the Allied forces bravely defeating the enemy on the front lines, a firm foundation for victory has been laid. Up to today, the war has passed its third year, and the war has become increasingly fierce, reaching a decisive stage.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Illusions Completely Shattered</p>
<p>After the enemy landed on Guadalcanal, fantasies of victory surrounded the enemy, thinking that the main force of the Japanese navy had been defeated, and landing on the coast of China and even reaching the Japanese mainland would be as easy as turning their hand. However, after the Battle of Taiwan, followed by the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the facts of the war shattered the enemy's illusions. The estimations of the enemy's General Staff's operational plan had to be automatically corrected. This is just the first blow, the first correction. Subsequent blows and subsequent corrections will occur two or three times until the enemy is forced to abandon their dream of re-aggression. Compatriots, we must strengthen our belief in victory. The results of the war in recent years have proven that the belief in victory is not an illusion, not empty talk, but based on 100% factual evidence. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Second Anniversary of Participation in the War: Mass Rally Held, Heads of Various Agencies Attended and Delivered Speeches</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the second anniversary of our country's participation in the war. Considering the great significance of our country's participation in the war, and to express the belief of all the people of the city in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, under the auspices of the Municipal Propaganda Office, the "Shanghai Citizens' Victory Celebration Rally Commemorating the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War" was held yesterday morning at the Daguangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. Attending were the heads of various agencies, Municipal Government Secretary-General Wu, Chief of Staff Xiong of the Security Command, President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy, Director Liu of the Municipal Party Department, Director Dai of the Education Bureau, Director Gu of the Baojia Office, Director Liang of the Propaganda Office, Matsudaira, Head of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Embassy, Chairman Yuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and more than two thousand representatives from various agencies, public organizations, military police, Baojia, and youth groups.</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Speech: At 10:00 a.m., the meeting began with music. After Yuan Ludeng, representing the presidium, led the attendees in observing the rituals, he read the National Government's Proclamation of War and delivered the opening speech, saying in brief: "Today is the second anniversary of our country's participation in the war. Shanghai citizens from all walks of life are holding this victory celebration rally here, and I am very excited by your enthusiastic participation. The Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of all East Asian nations. Our country's participation in the war is the foundation for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. Our country's participation in this war is for the independence of the country, for the co-prosperity of East Asia, and even more for the happiness of our descendants. Therefore, we should concentrate the strength and spirit of each individual and contribute to the completion of the war and the completion of liberation. For two years, the glorious achievements of the Allied forces on the front lines have strengthened our belief in inevitable victory. We are now at the decisive stage, and we, the citizens of Shanghai, can only fulfill the responsibilities of the rear area, redouble our efforts, and pray for the early arrival of the bright future. I offer these thoughts as my opening speech today and wish the front lines victory."</p>
<p>Xiong Jiandong's Speech: Next, Chief of Staff Xiong of the Security Command delivered a speech on behalf of the command, saying in brief: "On this second anniversary of our participation in the war, we should express our respect for the spirit of the Allied forces fighting bravely on the front lines. In order to strive for freedom and resist the shackles of the American and British enemies, we should continue the late Chairman Wang's legacy under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, share life and death with the Allies, put all our spirit into the first line of the decisive battle, actively seek national peace and unity, and contribute all our strength to defending East Asia and liberating East Asia, in order to achieve victory as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Jiang Xiyuan's Speech: Next, President Jiang Xiyuan of the Central Naval Academy delivered a speech, saying in brief: "This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. We should seize this opportunity for inevitable victory and strive for vigorous development. On the front lines of the Greater East Asia War are the Allied naval, land, and air forces, fighting a great battle of blood and fire with the American enemy with a spirit of loyalty and courage. But the people of Greater East Asia in the rear should also cooperate with the soldiers on the front lines with this spirit to seize this last five-minute opportunity and overcome the difficulties together."</p>
<p>Matsudaira's Speech: Next, Matsudaira, Head of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech in Chinese, saying in brief: "Today is the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, and I am participating in this grand meeting with a very excited mood. Since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese National Government has repeatedly issued statements, vowing to share weal and woe and life and death with Japan. The Japanese people have a deeper understanding of China, and the relationship between China and Japan has therefore become closer. After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Japan returned all concessions in order to enable China to complete its sovereign independence and territorial integrity. However, China's demand for true sovereign independence and territorial integrity depends on the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The battle with the American enemy is becoming more and more fierce every day, and Britain not only refuses to recognize the independence of Burma and India, but also attacks them. From this, we can know that the Anglo-Americans have the ambition to occupy all countries in East Asia as their own and attempt to turn all countries in East Asia into Anglo-American slaves. Therefore, we must unite all the nations of Greater East Asia to jointly destroy the Anglo-Americans. Now, Japan is using the Philippine Islands as a base and organizing special attack teams with brave young people, using their own bodies as bombs to destroy enemy ships and enemy aircraft. This spirit, I think, is enough to inspire the Chinese people to rise up together. As long as we adhere to our purpose and strive to fight, the victory of the Greater East Asia War will certainly be achieved. I hope everyone will redouble their efforts for the country and for East Asia." After the speech, everyone stood up to read a congratulatory telegram to Acting Chairman Chen and Prime Minister Koiso of the Allied Nations. Finally, they shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Press Association Holds a Lecture Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Press Association held a lecture meeting commemorating participation in the war yesterday (the 9th) afternoon at 5:00 p.m. at the Daguangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. Chen Binhe, Chairman of the Association, Executive Directors Osaka and Shinichi, Chen Riping, Xu Liqu, Jin Xiongbai, Chu Baojie, Yuan Shu, and Moriyama Kyo attended the meeting. Guests included Hidaka Seima, Editor-in-Chief of the New Shenbao. Chen Binhe presided over the meeting, and Secretary-General Lu Feng reported the significance of the meeting. Chen Riping, Deputy Director of Xinwen Daily, then delivered a speech. His words were sharp and aroused the emotions of the audience, lasting for about half an hour. After the speech, the film "Hero and Beauty" began to be screened, ending at 8:00 p.m. Chen Riping's speech is recorded below.</p>
<p>Chen Riping's Speech: Today is the second anniversary of our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War. I have some thoughts and hopes that I would like to discuss with everyone. First, the Greater East Asia War must be completed. Looking back at the period when Anglo-American forces expanded in East Asia, they used their aggressive principles in politics and economics. In particular, our country has been devastated and humiliated for more than 100 years since the Opium War with Britain, and the opium poison has not been eradicated in our country. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of it. Also, the United States restricts the entry of overseas Chinese, discriminates against races, and openly treats them unequally. I ask, can people with even a little bit of backbone endure this kind of treatment of us? Furthermore, they use concessions as a basis to exploit our people and use extraterritoriality as a shield to erode our rights and interests, despise the national system, and insult the nation. The shame of the family and the country is greater than this. Moreover, the greater the pressure, the stronger the reaction. The pressure we have received is indeed great and heavy, so in order to seek national survival and national revival, the government resolutely participated in the war, and the people unanimously supported it. This kind of power is stronger than any power. No matter how much pressure others put on us, as long as we persevere to the end, with hundreds of millions of people united, I dare say that our goal can definitely be achieved and our mission can definitely be completed. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War must be completed. We must examine and cooperate with each other. Under the wartime system, we must pay attention to two things: stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening our strength. Chairman Wang gave clear instructions at the one-week anniversary last year, the main points of which are: (1) rectify thought, (2) ensure public safety, and (3) increase production. Over the years, the government authorities have made efforts, but it cannot be said that they have been completely satisfactory. At the same time, the people have not been able to eliminate profiteering and hedonism, which has had a considerable impact on the overall situation. We must understand that the country should be based on the people, and the people should put the country first. We must think of the greater good and not seek self-interest, especially at this final juncture and decisive stage. The government and the people, the people and the government, must unite and be consistent with the outside world in order to achieve national prosperity and peace. Therefore, everyone must painfully restrain themselves, and all behaviors that hinder the national economy and people's livelihood must be eradicated. All levels must cooperate and jointly shoulder the obligations that participating in the war requires of its citizens.</p>
<p>We recognize the great significance of participating in the war, and at the same time strengthen our confidence that we must complete it. If we work together with one heart and one mind and fight bravely, then the final victory will surely belong to us. This is an undoubtedly certain result and also the point we must reach.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Thirteenth Air Defense Day: Various Trainings Were Implemented, the Entire Day in a State of Air Defense</h3>

Although alarm sirens were not sounded during this alarm training, citizens were able to implement various measures in accordance with the prescribed time under the command of police and security personnel. At 8:00 a.m., a training alert was issued, followed by an air raid alarm at 9:30 a.m., an air raid alarm cancellation at 10:30 a.m., and an alert cancellation at 11:30 a.m. In the afternoon, a training alert was issued at 2:00 p.m., an air raid alarm at 3:00 p.m., an air raid alarm cancellation at 4:00 p.m., and an alert cancellation at 5:00 p.m. In the evening, a training air raid alarm was issued at 7:00 p.m., followed by an air raid alarm cancellation at 7:30 p.m., and a full alert cancellation at 8:00 p.m. During the various training alarms, traffic control and lighting control were implemented. The management of air defense lights has also improved. During the training air raid alarms, all entertainment venues were closed, and the audience was guided to the designated shelters. The situation was good.</p>
<p>Communication Training: The Air Defense Authority, in order to guard against any unfortunate event that may disrupt all communication channels, must quickly carry out communication work. Therefore, communication training was implemented from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. yesterday. At that time, an alarm was received from the Army and Navy Air Defense Day Headquarters, and communication was immediately implemented to the various branch offices and relevant agencies and organizations. Each branch office had a police and defense section responsible for receiving the report and immediately ordering the liaison officers stationed at each Lianbao to return to their respective Lianbao to communicate the message, and then the communication officers of each Lianbao notified each Bao, and the communication officers of each Bao communicated the message within each Bao by ringing a bell. At the same time, ten liaison officers from each district were under the command of the Air Defense Section Chief at the Air Defense Headquarters, quickly communicating the message. Thoroughness and accuracy must be ensured. On the one hand, the Baojia authorities of each district, after receiving the alarm communication, immediately hung blue and red signal triangular flags at designated traffic intersections and prominent locations based on the issued alert and air raid alarm orders so that the public could be fully aware of the situation and take all necessary measures. The results were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Local Training: At the same time, the Air Defense Authority thoroughly improved air defense measures and, starting from this Air Defense Day, implemented local general staff training in the areas under the jurisdiction of each branch office, starting with Huangpu District. Training was first implemented north of Fuzhou Road in the district from 2:00 p.m. and south of Fuzhou Road from 3:00 p.m. Police and security personnel from each district came to the scene to observe. The training was conducted under the command of Kobayashi Minemiro, the head of the branch office, and Liu Yaying, the deputy head of the branch office. The Air Defense Headquarters and military and police authorities sent personnel to inspect the training. The entire area was divided into twenty-one locations, and the detonation of firecrackers was simultaneously trained to simulate the blind bombing of a large squadron of enemy aircraft. Each location had emergency situations of being bombed and hit by bullets. Police and security personnel and nearby residents participated in drills such as extinguishing fires, rescuing, and providing first aid. At the same time, upon hearing the sound of firecrackers, nearby residents conducted evacuation training, and the atmosphere was very tense. The simulation was very realistic. The training ended at 4:00 p.m. This local training will be implemented in different districts in the future.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Training: Each district specified different areas to implement comprehensive training in rescue, fire fighting, and evacuation. Huangpu had two locations, Laozha had five sessions from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Xincheng had four locations, Jing'an Temple had four locations, Jiangning Road had two locations, Putuo Road had four locations, Hongkou had two locations, West Hongkou had two locations, North Sichuan Road had five locations, Tilanqiao had five locations, Yulin Road had three locations, Yangshupu had two locations, Xinshijie had two locations, Taishan had a total of sixteen locations, Lujiabang had four locations, Changshu Road had two locations, Huashan had two locations, Changning had three locations, Yimiao had two locations, Penglai Road had one location, Xieqiao had four locations, Xujiahui had seven locations, Zhabei had three locations, and Dongchang Road had two locations. During these comprehensive trainings, the heads of the respective branch offices and the police and defense sections presided over the training and directed the activities on site. Baojia personnel and residents participated in the training, and the police, security personnel, and civilians jointly implemented air defense work. At the same time, the specially established defense groups of various factories and buildings held air defense exercises separately, and the authorities sent personnel to guide them, and all air defense equipment was thoroughly inspected.</p>
<p>In addition, the Nanmatou street area of the city held various air defense exercises at 10:00 a.m., and in the afternoon, the Dongchang Road Police Branch supervised fire protection, rescue, and evacuation work in its Changzhan street area.</p>
<h3>Price Evaluation Committee to Stop Vegetable Price Increases</h3>

The 100 million yuan jointly borrowed by the other ten banks, including Zhejiang, Xingye, Zhejiang Industrial, Continental, Jin Cheng, Zhongnan, Salt Industry, Shanghai Commercial, Guohua, and Xinhua Four Bank Savings Society, is specifically for industrial loans and industrial and commercial enterprise investment projects.</p>
<h3>Vagrant Labor Camp Begins Reception Work: Starting with Ruffians at Docks and Stations</h3>
<p>In order to educate vagrants and beggars, reform hooligans and gangsters, and force them to work, thereby increasing production and cooperating with public security, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Municipal Government have jointly established the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. Since preparations began in April last year, it has been fully completed. The first reception center is now located at No. 267 Penglai Road, Nanshi, specializing in organizing work such as registration, investigation, and medical treatment for vagrants entering the camp. A special reception center has also been established in Caohejing, specializing in receiving vagrants with bad character who need strict education and management in order to improve their character and participate in labor. In addition, the camp has also been allocated the former training camp and model prison site in Huacao Town by the Municipal Government as the first and second farms for vagrants to cultivate. It is scheduled to start reception this month, but due to limited funding and small scale, it is currently unable to universally accommodate all vagrants in the city. After deliberation by the board of directors, it was decided to start with the hooligans and gangsters who extort passengers and harm the people most at the city's docks and stations, in order to reduce the suffering of travelers. The camp has sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau for assistance.</p>

A huge amount of money is needed. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association borrowed 50 million yuan from the Central Reserve Bank to expand the winter relief funds of the association, and it was guaranteed by the Municipal Finance Bureau. It is reported that the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to allocate the funds. Yesterday (the 9th), Sun Guangdi, Director of the General Affairs Section of the Association, went to the Central Reserve Bank to collect the funds, and the bank allocated the full amount.</p>

Among them, 200,000 were the proceeds from one day's work by all employees on a holiday; the remaining 300,000 are from monthly salary profit-sharing.
