<p>東京十八日中央社電　日大木營十八日下午一時三十分發表：敵機動部隊出現於九州東南海面，艦上機自十八日晨六時許，對九州東南部地區繼續其波狀之來襲，該處日軍部隊立即邀擊，正陸續收獲相當戰果中。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　保衛國土之日航空部隊，十八日晨以拼撞戰法，果敢出擊出現於九州及四國南方海上之敵機動部隊，收獲擊沉敵戰艦或特設空母一艘，轟沉巡洋艦一艘，燃燒制式空母一艘之戰果，仍繼續攻擊中。</p>
<p>敵艦載機八百架波狀襲九州四國</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　敵機動部隊半月以來已消聲歛跡，茲又復出現於九州東南方海面，上午六時復以艦載機主力，對九州南部及東部地區之機塲行其慣技之波狀攻擊。另一部來襲四國和歌山縣，上午來襲敵機數計共的八百架，該處日軍部隊踴躍邀撃，已獲得莫大戰果。按敵機動部隊自二月十六，十七兩日以六百架艦載機來戰關東地方後，又於是月二十五日以艦載機六百架來襲關東地方，嗣後轉變方向，以艦載機六百架左右來襲南西諸島。關於此三决來襲之敵艦載機，自其機數觀之，已有逐次減少之傾向，由此可知敵每次來襲之際，均蒙重創，乃顯然之事實。按敵機動部隊自一日空襲南西諸島後，返回後方基地烏爾退加羅林羣島補充其損耗，迨整備後復出於九州近海，而開始蠢動。</p>
<h3 id="c2">美飛機生產量不及補充損失 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊　美國B29型轟炸機，以馬利亞納島爲其根據地，對日施行轟炸，至最近，其活動漸决激化，即本月九日空襲東京，十一日襲名屋，一日襲大阪，又於十七日襲神戶，美方宣傳其戰果甚大，然事實並非如此。美方號稱空中要塞之B29型轟炸機，現有勢力及其今後活動能力之程度如何，略述如下：據聯合國方面發表，本月九日，十一日至十三日三次對日空襲之參加機數，每决三百架，然據日本方面可靠調查，九日一百三十架，十一日一百三十架，十三日九十架，十七日六十架，可知美虛傳參加機數之多，以圖威脅宣傳，且美方數决對日空襲，是否每决使用同一飛機，亦爲頗饒興味之問題。蓋日方防空部隊在東京，名古屋，大阪等各地予敵方之損害，爲擊落四十八架，擊傷一百七十架，美方即以新機補充被擊落之飛機，及其被擊傷者加以修理後，再行使用，確係事實。由其參加攻擊之機數，損害數及每次使用同一飛機各點判斷，現在馬利亞納島根據地之B29型飛機實數最多爲二百五十架，然該根據地可收容三百五十架，而參加空襲日本之機數每次減少，由此觀之，可知美方攻擊力以此種程度爲其最大力量。如美方所宣傳，每次參加空襲機數三百架，或馬利亞納根據地可收容七百架，乃至八百架等，實絕非事實也。至於今後B29型飛機活動情形如何，則與美方補充能力與日本防空部隊所予損害數有重要關係。按美國製造B29型飛機設備，已有固定性，絕無幾何學級數的增加生產能力與技術，據稱：去年六七月間之每月生產數爲一百二十架，至十二月僅增至一百三十五架，故目前每月製產數，似係一百架乃至一百五十架。去年日方防空部隊所予損害，計擊落六百七十五架之多，已超過其生產數量，故其存貨已八銳減。又本年B29型機空襲日本時所受損失數，每决增加，即一月間擊落七十四架，擊傷一百四十一架，二月間擊洛七十八架，擊傷五十二架，三月間（截至前日止）擊落六十八架，擊傷二百十架，共計撃落二百二十架，撃傷四百零三架，與去年份總計則撃落撃傷機數共達一千二百九十八架之巨大數量。假定擊傷機之半數可能加以修理，再次使用，其爲日方所受損失不下　百六十架，每月雖能生產一百三十架，然因輸送等關係，實際可以供給前綫使用者爲八十五架，故上述爲日方所受損失之數，等於美方十個月份之生產數量。據以上統計，B29型飛機之將來性，殊堪悲觀，最近駐華美空軍之無聲色，B29型機空襲日本機數之減少等等事實，足以證明也。</p>

<p>東京十八日中央社電大東亞本週戰况，顯著之特徴，即敵海上作戰之重點已漸漸離開硫黄鳥，而馬紹爾，馬利亞納方面敵基地空軍之整備顯著進展，又敵機動部隊則正在爲整備各次期作戰，而鞏固其進攻據點。</p>
<p>（一）硫黄島方面，硫黄島北部各據點，逐决爲敵軍勢力侵入，玉名山之日軍守備部隊，於八日曾以主力突入敵軍陣地奮戰，迄十三日大部均行壯烈戰死。天山之日軍陣地，曾屢决摧毀敵軍之攻擊，至十三日終於委諸敵手，該島日軍守備部隊，自上月十九日敵軍登陸以來，所予敵軍之損害，一如日大本營十六日之發表，共達二萬五千八百名之多，可見日軍守備隊將士奮戰之激烈。</p>
<p>（二）菲律賓方面，自敵軍在仁牙因灣登陸以來，迄八日止，二個月中日軍殺傷敵軍的九萬人，予以莫大損害以外，更予敵軍多數大砲與軍需品以龐大損害，刻下日軍士氣仍極旺盛，正在繼續奮戰中。馬尼刺地區敵軍，對馬尼刺東方地區之攻擊愈益本裕化，其砲擊亦漸次熾列。克拉克地區日軍部隊，依然繼續奮戰，刻下戰局無大變化。呂宋北部之行動，最近頓行活潑，遂漸利用其技術，克服地形之困難，於山陵地帶構築公路，企圖逐漸向內地伸張，而特別置重點於極長岸地區，傾注三師兵力，其第一綫已進抵彭坑與卡朗格朗一帶，又薩拉克薩克大有企圖向巴圓本平地一帶伸張之勢，當地日軍部隊據守之陣地將其擊退。又民答那峨島九日晨在贊伯安卡登陸之敵軍，連日反復作艦砲射擊與掃射。在市外飛機塲附近繼續激戰。</p>
<p>（三）緬甸方面，北緬地區新編第一軍及第五十師團，繼續進迫臘戌之曼達萊地區，以曼達萊爲中心之戰局，突然激烈，擁有戰車五六十輛之敵軍機甲部隊，侵入美格得拉附近，日軍部隊由南北兩方猛烈夾攻後，業將一旦落入敵手之各機塲完全奪回，刻在包圍攻撃中。在曼達來北方的七十公里處，渡過伊洛瓦底江之印度第三十九師，逐漸南下，本月八日侵入曼達萊。同時，曼達萊西方之明姆與加珍方面之敵，亦逐次前進。九日，亦迫近曼達萊西南三十公里之米的達北方地區，曼達萊之日軍部隊據守王城，與敵激戰，伊洛瓦底江南岸地區之精銳，亦在猛攻敵軍中。</p>
<p>（四）印度洋方面，本週印度洋方面之敵軍，僅以若十小艦艇活動於安達曼羣島北方。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c5">反軸心國之矛盾 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>克里米亞會議的召集，不但顯露了美英蘇三國間矛盾的深刻，因而不得不謀開會解決；就會後發表的公報而觀，可知三國間矛盾中心的政治問題，一些未甘解決，英美反在繼續對德作戰的軍事前提之下，向蘇讓步，以謀取暫時的合作。換言之克里米亞會議不但未消弭三國間的矛盾，反爲未來的糾紛播下了新的種子。</p>
<p>這種矛盾的基本原因，當然是三國政體的不同與政策的相異，同時也是三國各謀擴展其勢力的必然結果。英國爲圖保持其戰前地位，竭力誘惑美蘇在戰爭未結束前的今日，預先瓜分了歐洲的勢力範圍；美國自恃其經濟力量的雄厚，深信戰後必能從經濟征服歐洲進而政治征服歐洲，所以高唱門戶開放機會均等，反對英國提出的瓜分計劃，蘇聯則竭力避免在目前談判戰後的問題，而高唱軍事第一，因爲蘇聯在戰爭的進行中事實上隨時擴大佔領區，以兵力的擴張增加其對歐洲甚至對全世界的發言椒，他要求的是英美在西綫牽掣德國兵力，使其軍事行動得以順利進行，地盤日益擴大，同時也要求美國繼續其軍火租借法案，使其兵力更加龐大，這個也是蘇聯擴展本身勢力最切實的要圖。</p>
<p>因此，最近幾月中：蘇聯破壞了英國策劃的「西歐聯盟」方案；蘇聯對美要求供給大量重工業機械及六十億金元信用借款，被美國拒絕；另方面英美離間日蘇關係，使蘇聯分散兵力消耗國力的陰謀，始終不爲蘇聯一顧。而最近在倫敦召開的國際勞工代表大會中，澈底進行反日戰爭的議決案，反爲自詡勞工祖國的蘇聯所單獨提出要求例外。</p>
<p>反軸心國的結合原是利害的結合，盲從的弱小國家徒供三國的利用與犧牲。試觀意大利的波諾米政權，始終被目爲卑鄙的叛徒，克里米亞會議公報上對於波諾米政權的意大利，會未提及一字；試觀爲極盡誘惑而平時常被列入四强之一的渝政權，在宰割世界這一重要的會議中，亦未被邀參加；對反軸心國最忠誠而出力極多的法國特戈爾政權，公報中被當作「被解放的國家」，對其再三提出的參加克里米亞會議的要求，始終不予接納。……由此以觀，僅在克里米亞會議中三國對弱小國的態度已原形畢露，不論英美怎樣用經濟壓迫，用恫嚇和甘言蜜語，强迫許多一向維持中立的弱小國家，對日德宣戰，實際上沒有一個心悅誠服的，這種舉動，無補於反軸心國的聲勢，可以斷言。</p>

<p>美從軍記者前綫通訊一致備述困於日軍猛攻及困難地形之美軍苦况，陸戰隊隨軍記者大衛。鄧普希二十二日特電稱：「四日前美軍冒日軍猛烈砲火强行登陸後，至二月二十二日美軍戰綫已呈澈底破壞之狀，慘况難以名狀，自南端摺鉢山以北二哩，破片積成厚層。數十艘舟艇殘骸，證明美軍登陸此島時所付代價。日軍重砲·日砲·火箭砲等，日夜狂吼，張彈幕於海濱，且其射擊準確異常。此方海岸係火山灰構成，多數車輛前進未及十呎即已深陷其中，難以行動，而濱海高的數碼之岩壁亦足妨礙車輛前進，日軍砲火乃得乘機猛射。二日間業已登岸之卡車，僅僅數輛，一切補充物資均由人力運往前綫。深陷灰砂中之大型水陸兩用卡車，宛如鐵鍋煎薄餅。卸物用起重機登陸後，每傾向一側，起卸中之大砲亂於未用前即吿破壞。後續車輛亦無睱拓道。砲兵隊甚至於二十四小時後猶未能登陸。衣包·防毒面具·什用雜物等，多遭日軍榴霰彈炸毀，散布沿岸五哩地帶，其間復有無數斷槍折劍，以及美兵信函，戰爭誠已透入人類生命中矣。死神翱翔於殘骸間。海濱美軍屍體，多爲海波埋於砂中。」又美中部太平洋前綫地區司令部發言人的翰·胡佛亦稱：「硫黄島作戰爲太平洋美軍最難戰鬥。陸戰瞰登岸時，初未受猛烈砲火抵抗，唯日軍旋即開砲猛擊，美軍戰車及士兵遂紛紛破損倒斃，令人有上陸據點行將傾覆之感。此戰實較塞班之役更爲艱難。上陸後最初五十七小時內，每小時平均傷亡數較中太平洋迄今所有任何戰鬥爲多。」</p>
<p>又紐的來電，美廣播公司代表報道員哈特，蕯契亞廿二日自硫黄島海面泰拿中將所乘旗艦播送硫黄島戰况稱：「硫黄島上現正展開迄今任何戰鬥所不能比擬之劇戰，情况慘烈，堪改稱此島爲地獄島，言之令人毛髪聳然。余曾目擊陸戰隊依决登陸，匐匍前進，與日軍展開白刃戰。此項戰法須有異常努力。日美雙方砲戰，徹夜不息。世上茍有地獄，則必此硫黄島是矣。此次上陸作戰誠非容易，其困難實有出於意料者。日軍迫擊砲及重砲之彈幕，隨處皆有。上陸舟艇毀於海濱者比此皆是。足與硫黄島一役相擬之戰，實未前覩。」（里斯本同盟社電）（譯目二月二十五日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週仍趨平穩，交易變動甚少。烚赤暗市起伏甚微，紋銀亦無變化，公債漲跌互見，買賣殊不踴旺。華股則以邇來銀根暗鬆，有利多頭，一般人心購吸股票，顧慮較前減少，故股市趨勢日佳，交易旺盛，三熱門股市價益挺。工商各業情形亦較過去爲好，雖工廠各業尙未能全部復工開車，但以消費者不多，供應需求似有接扳平衡之勢，其因交通方面較前轉趨良好，土產物品運輸困難，略見減少。米、雜糧、油、蔬菜及其他生產原料，來源稍漸暢旺，民生略能安定。市價均趨平定，同時以經濟當局抑平物價執行已收宏效，投機囤積斂跡，是以漲風一時不易再見。</p>

<p>— 錢仲禾</p>
<p>二月二十八日筆者接到法商電燈公司　費通知書（平常二十日左近可收到，大概因郵遞巡緩的關係），上面規定了用電限額，這種限額各家不同，就是從前規定同樣限度的用戶這次亦並不相同，經我打聽研究之後，得到下列幾種使人不懂的算法（各用戶以前都不准超過十三度的）。</p>
<p>一，上月份未用滿十三度者，照對折計算，限額不滿六度半。</p>
<p>二，上月份多用三分，新限額是三度半。</p>
<p>三，多用六分，限額是三度。</p>
<p>四，多用二度七分，限額是三度。</p>
<p>五，多用二度半，限額是四度半。</p>
<p>由上而記錄中可以看出電燈公司對無誠意協助節約電力者加以懲罰，這種懲罰，在原則上應當贊同，但是每月的用電是從該月八日起算的，在這未接到新限額通知之先，各用戶總還以爲「限額不滿六度半」，現在突然在二十八日接到這個通知，則受罰諸用戶，勢必大受影響，因此我們希望該公司對這一點有變通的辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c29">米市—漕河涇 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>上海市民的食米，一部分由漕河涇供給，因此，上海人對漕河　的印象很深。</p>
<p>當地並不產米，主要出產是棉花黃豆和菜蔬。它之所以成爲米糧集散地，是近年來交通不便形成的。松江，泗涇等地的產米不能直接運到上海，於是由河道運到漕河涇，再由米販們背負到上海來。每天經過這里的米有一千多石。食米到了漕河涇，已經通過許多「關卡」，所以當地市價此上海市區　　不　多少，譬如本月十六日市價：秈米每斗約八千四百元，普通松江白米約八千八百元，白粳約九千一百元。菜蔬比較便宜，只一百五十元一斤，豬肉也要八百九百一斤。</p>
<p>三點希望</p>
<p>爲了明瞭當地情形，特訪問漕河涇鄕鄕長陳學愚氏。據說「本鄕共有十八保，約有居民九千人，大多數務農。當地有漕涇小學一所，約有學生三百餘人，是鄕公所辦的。治安情形很好，　　　第一團第一大隊駐紥着。」談到鄕公所的困難和當地民生的凋敝，陳鄕長說有三點期望：（一）希望上海慈善團體注意近郊貧民的生活，在漕河涇從來沒有舉辦過施粥等善舉，去冬四百套寒衣還是由鄕公所向社會福利局請求發下來的。（二）希望上海的銀行家們舉辦農貸，現在春耕在即，農民需款孔急。（三）希望政府當局顧到鄕公所的困難，因爲鄕公所沒有經費，僅靠向當地商店捐助維持。而所負義務却很繁重，僅供應柴草一項，月需五六十担，別的不必說起了。</p>
<p>工業停頓</p>
<p>當地陸路交通有滬杭路和通七寶的漕寶公路，水路就是東通黃浦西達七寶，泗涇，松江的漕河，每天有許多米船柴船抵達這裏。碾米廠有四家，最近因馬達電停止供應，柴油引擎費用浩大，所以從前每天能碾米一千多石，現在大爲減少，軋棉廠開工者也很少，因爲收買棉花的價格，不够血本，結果農民不得不改種黃豆蔬菜，於是棉花產量比往年減少，小型紗廠有興農公司一家，大中襪廠一家，戰前當地花邊工藝等手工業很發達，近年來海運不通，也停頓多時。</p>
<p>社會服務　義務小學積極推動</p>
<p>謝立林君建議設義學金</p>
<p>本處準備舉辦義務小學一事，已在十五日本欄略記經過。我們的動機，由於前爲協助小學師資進修，舉辦小學敎師寒假進修會，導師悉心講解，熱忱可佩。聽講敎師虛心砌礎，情緒融洽。在這個環境裏，共同發生兩種同情心，其一是窮苦學童的失學，其二是一部分小學敎師的失業。由於同情心的發展，更共同認爲如以失業敎師敎育失學學童，倒是兩受其益的事。根據上面的見解，經商量結果，請由本報舉辦義務小學。　就是我們的動機。至於我們的目的，很　單的，就是希望做到使失業敎師敎育失學兒童。</p>
<p>我們爲實現這一工作，另組「申報義務敎育委員會」專責辦理。日昨舉行第一次會議，對於商借校舍，選任敎師，徵集書籍，規定課程，經費預算諸問題，均經充分交換意見。我們認爲這一工作，原須國家的力量，或是社會的力量，才能有效舉起，決不是一個團體，少數人所可担當的。同時，我們也不願自大自秘的辦理。將來一切工作，隨時公開報告社會，希望讀者諸君指示與協助。</p>
<p>目前最迫切需要者，還是經費籌集，雖承四團體主辦的義賣市塲的熱忱，捐撥開辦費一百萬元，不過，依據我們最低估計，經常費用，不敷尙鉅。然而，我們願意先把工作積極推動，以做到的事實引起社會人士的同情贊助。這裏，我們先把讀者謝立林先生的來借發表，謝君建議另闢「義學金」，並首先捐款倡導，他的建議，他的熱忱，都與我們的旨趣相符，我們當然希望羣起響應。</p>
<p>謝立林君　義學金</p>
<p>謝君函云：「頃見貴報社會服務　消息，欣知舉辦義務小學十所，一方面挽救失學兒童，一方面補助敎師生活，用意極佳。但上海義務小學之需要，豈只十所。義校所需之經費，豈只義賣市塲之餘款所能應付。此稱免費敎育之推行，非由社會人土共同協助不爲功。因思貴報所創辦之讀者助學金功績卓然。今不妨依照此項辦法，另闢義務小學助學金，簡稱「義學金」。貴報服務社會，向著聲譽。登高一呼，「義學金」之捐助，勢必源源而來。茲將平日節約所得儲券一萬元充作「讀者義學金」。區區之數不足以言倡導，唯望拋磚引玉，共起響應，使失學兒意得能造成有用人才，社會幸甚，國家幸甚。謝立林謹啓三月十六日」</p>

<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force, defending the homeland, launched a courageous attack on the enemy task force appearing in the southern seas off Kyushu and Shikoku on the morning of the 18th, employing ramming tactics. They achieved the results of sinking one enemy battleship or converted aircraft carrier, sinking one cruiser with bombs, and setting one standard aircraft carrier ablaze. The attack is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft, 800 Strong, Attack Kyushu and Shikoku in Waves</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The enemy task force, silent for half a month, has reappeared in the southeastern sea off Kyushu. At 6:00 AM, they resumed their customary wave attacks on airfields in the southern and eastern regions of Kyushu, using their main force of carrier-based aircraft. Another unit attacked Shikoku and Wakayama Prefecture. The total number of enemy aircraft attacking in the morning was about 800. Japanese forces in the area vigorously engaged, achieving significant results. According to reports, after the enemy task force attacked the Kanto region with 600 carrier-based aircraft on February 16th and 17th, and then again on February 25th with 600 carrier-based aircraft, they changed direction and attacked the Southwestern Islands with around 600 carrier-based aircraft. Judging from the number of aircraft in these three attacks, there is a clear tendency for the number to decrease with each attack. From this, it is evident that the enemy suffered heavy damage each time they attacked. It is believed that after the enemy task force attacked the Southwestern Islands on the 1st, they returned to their rear base on Ulithi and the Caroline Islands to replenish their losses, and after resupply, reappeared off the coast of Kyushu and began to stir.</p>
<h3 id="e2">American Aircraft Production Fails to Replenish Losses <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The American B-29 bombers, using the Mariana Islands as their base, have been bombing Japan. Recently, their activities have become increasingly intense, with air raids on Tokyo on the 9th of this month, Nagoya on the 11th, Osaka on the 15th, and Kobe on the 17th. The Americans have claimed great results, but the reality is not so. The current strength and future operational capability of the B-29 bombers, which the Americans call "flying fortresses," are outlined below: According to announcements by the Allied side, the number of aircraft participating in the three air raids on Japan from the 9th to the 13th of this month was 300 each time. However, according to reliable Japanese investigations, the numbers were 130 on the 9th, 130 on the 11th, 90 on the 13th, and 60 on the 17th. This shows that the Americans are exaggerating the number of participating aircraft to intimidate and spread propaganda. Furthermore, whether the Americans are using the same aircraft each time they raid Japan is also a very interesting question. This is because the Japanese anti-aircraft forces have inflicted damage on the enemy in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and other locations, shooting down 48 aircraft and damaging 170. It is a fact that the Americans are replenishing the downed aircraft with new ones and repairing the damaged ones for reuse. Judging from the number of aircraft participating in the attacks, the number of damaged aircraft, and the fact that the same aircraft are being used repeatedly, the actual number of B-29 aircraft at the Mariana Islands base is at most 250. Although the base can accommodate 350, the number of aircraft participating in raids on Japan is decreasing each time. From this, it can be seen that the Americans' offensive power is at its maximum at this level. The claims by the Americans that 300 aircraft participated in each raid, or that the Mariana base can accommodate 700 or even 800 aircraft, are simply not true. As for how the B-29 aircraft will operate in the future, this is closely related to the Americans' ability to replenish them and the amount of damage inflicted by the Japanese anti-aircraft forces. The production facilities for the American B-29 aircraft have been fixed and there is no geometric increase in production capacity or technology. It is said that the monthly production number between June and July of last year was 120, and by December it had only increased to 135. Therefore, the current monthly production number seems to be 100 to 150. Last year, the Japanese anti-aircraft forces inflicted heavy damage, shooting down 675 aircraft, which exceeded the production volume, so their stock has been sharply reduced. Furthermore, the number of B-29 aircraft lost during air raids on Japan this year has been increasing with each attack. In January, 74 aircraft were shot down and 141 were damaged. In February, 78 were shot down and 52 were damaged. In March (up to yesterday), 68 were shot down and 210 were damaged. This totals 220 shot down and 403 damaged, which, combined with last year's total, amounts to a huge number of 1,298 aircraft shot down or damaged. Assuming that half of the damaged aircraft can be repaired and reused, the number of losses suffered by the Japanese is no less than 1,060 aircraft. Although 130 aircraft can be produced each month, due to transportation and other factors, only 85 can actually be supplied to the front lines. Therefore, the number of losses suffered by the Japanese is equivalent to ten months of American production. Based on the above statistics, the future of the B-29 aircraft is quite bleak. The recent silence of the American Air Force stationed in China, and the reduction in the number of B-29 aircraft raiding Japan, are sufficient to prove this.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The notable characteristics of this week's war situation in Greater East Asia are that the focus of enemy naval operations has gradually shifted away from Iwo Jima, while the enemy's air force base development in the Marshall and Mariana Islands is progressing significantly. Also, the enemy task force is consolidating its offensive bases in preparation for various next-stage operations.</p>
<p>(1) Iwo Jima Area: Enemy forces have gradually penetrated the northern bases of Iwo Jima. The Japanese garrison at Mt. Tamana launched a major assault on the enemy's position on the 8th, fighting bravely until the 13th, when most of them were gloriously killed in action. The Japanese position on Mt. Tenzan repeatedly repelled the enemy's attacks, but finally fell into enemy hands on the 13th. Since the enemy landed on the island on the 19th of last month, the Japanese garrison has inflicted a total of 25,800 casualties on the enemy, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 16th, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting by the Japanese garrison soldiers.</p>
<p>(2) Philippine Area: Since the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, the Japanese army has killed or wounded 90,000 enemy soldiers in two months up to the 8th, inflicting enormous damage, and has also inflicted huge damage on a large number of enemy artillery and military supplies. The morale of the Japanese army is still very high, and they are continuing to fight bravely. Enemy forces in the Manila area are intensifying their attacks on the eastern region of Manila, and their shelling is also gradually intensifying. The Japanese forces in the Clark area are continuing to fight, and there is no major change in the situation. The actions in northern Luzon have recently become more active, and they are gradually using their technology to overcome the difficulties of the terrain, building roads in the mountainous areas, attempting to gradually extend inland, and placing special emphasis on the coastal area, pouring in three divisions. The first line has advanced to the Pengkeng and Kalangglang areas, and there is also a tendency for Salaksaksak to attempt to extend towards the Bayumbong plains. The Japanese forces stationed there repelled them. Furthermore, the enemy forces that landed in Zamboanga on Mindanao Island on the morning of the 9th have been repeatedly carrying out naval gun bombardment and strafing for days. Fierce fighting continues near the airfield outside the city.</p>
<p>(3) Burma Area: The New First Army and the 50th Division in northern Burma are continuing to advance on the Mandalay area of Lashio. The battle centered on Mandalay has suddenly intensified. An enemy armored unit with 50-60 tanks infiltrated the vicinity of Meiktila. After being fiercely attacked from both the north and south by Japanese forces, the various airfields that had once fallen into enemy hands were completely retaken, and are currently under siege. The Indian 39th Division, which crossed the Irrawaddy River 70 kilometers north of Mandalay, is gradually moving south and infiltrated Mandalay on the 8th of this month. At the same time, the enemy in the Myingyan and Kyaukse areas west of Mandalay is also gradually advancing. On the 9th, they also approached the northern area of Myittha, 30 kilometers southwest of Mandalay. The Japanese forces in Mandalay are defending the royal city and engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy. The elite forces in the southern bank region of the Irrawaddy River are also fiercely attacking the enemy.</p>
<p>(4) Indian Ocean Area: This week, enemy forces in the Indian Ocean area have only been operating with a few small vessels north of the Andaman Islands.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Contradictions of the Anti-Axis Powers <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The convening of the Crimean Conference not only revealed the deep contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, necessitating a meeting to resolve them, but also, judging from the communique issued after the meeting, the political issues at the center of the contradictions among the three countries were not resolved at all. Britain and the United States instead made concessions to the Soviet Union under the military premise of continuing the war against Germany, in order to seek temporary cooperation. In other words, the Crimean Conference not only did not eliminate the contradictions among the three countries, but also sowed new seeds for future disputes.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for these contradictions is, of course, the differences in the political systems and policies of the three countries, and also the inevitable result of each country seeking to expand its power. Britain, in order to maintain its pre-war status, has been trying to induce the United States and the Soviet Union to divide Europe's spheres of influence in advance before the war ends. The United States, relying on its strong economic power, is convinced that it will be able to conquer Europe economically after the war and then conquer it politically. Therefore, it advocates an open door policy and equal opportunity, and opposes Britain's proposed division plan. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is trying to avoid discussing post-war issues at the moment, and is advocating military first, because in the course of the war, the Soviet Union is in fact constantly expanding its occupied territories, using the expansion of its military power to increase its say in Europe and even the world. It demands that Britain and the United States tie down German forces on the Western Front, so that its military operations can proceed smoothly and its territory can continue to expand. It also demands that the United States continue its Lend-Lease Act, so that its military power can be even greater. This is also the most practical plan for the Soviet Union to expand its own power.</p>
<p>Therefore, in recent months: The Soviet Union undermined Britain's planned "Western European Alliance" plan. The Soviet Union's request to the United States for a large supply of heavy industrial machinery and a 6 billion gold ruble credit loan was rejected by the United States. On the other hand, the British and Americans' conspiracy to alienate Japanese-Soviet relations, causing the Soviet Union to disperse its forces and consume its national strength, has never been considered by the Soviet Union. And recently, at the International Labor Conference held in London, the resolution to thoroughly carry out the anti-Japanese war was instead proposed solely by the Soviet Union, which prides itself on being the motherland of labor.</p>
<p>The alliance of the anti-Axis powers was originally an alliance of interests. The blindly following weak countries are merely for the use and sacrifice of the three powers. Consider the Bonomi government of Italy, which has always been regarded as a despicable traitor. The Crimean Conference communique did not mention a word about Italy under the Bonomi government. Consider the Chongqing government, which is often included in the ranks of the four powers for the sake of temptation, but was not invited to participate in this important conference on dividing the world. The de Gaulle government of France, which has been the most loyal and contributed the most to the anti-Axis powers, was treated as a "liberated country" in the communique, and its repeated requests to participate in the Crimean Conference were never accepted. ... From this, it can be seen that the attitude of the three countries towards weak countries in the Crimean Conference alone has been fully revealed. No matter how Britain and the United States use economic oppression, intimidation, and sweet words to force many weak countries that have always maintained neutrality to declare war on Japan and Germany, in reality, none of them are sincerely convinced. This kind of action does not help the strength of the anti-Axis powers, it can be asserted.</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Evil Battle of Iwo Jima in the Mouths of the American Enemy - The War Situation is Tragic, Unprecedented and Unrepeatable <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>According to front-line news from Guam, American forces on Iwo Jima encountered fierce counterattacks from Japanese forces around Mt. Suribachi and the northern area of the South Airfield, and losses are increasing at an accelerated rate, and the situation is precarious. Lieutenant General Taylor therefore dispatched the 3rd Marine Division under Major General Erskine to land and reinforce, but the American forces are still in a difficult situation. According to a statement released by Admiral Nimitz Headquarters on February 23rd, the American forces seem to have launched another attack on the Japanese positions at the Central Airfield and Mt. Suribachi, but the Japanese forces are fiercely bombarding with heavy artillery and rocket artillery during the day, and at night are launching continuous night attacks with suicide squads, so bitter and evil battles continue endlessly. Associated Press special correspondent Elmont Waite sighed: "The Japanese army is fighting to the death at all points on the line."</p>
<p>American war correspondents' front-line dispatches unanimously describe the plight of the American forces, who are trapped by the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and the difficult terrain. Marine Corps war correspondent David Dempsey telegraphed on the 22nd: "Four days after the American forces forcibly landed under heavy Japanese fire, by February 22nd the American front line had been completely destroyed, and the tragic situation is indescribable. Two miles north of Mt. Suribachi at the southern end, fragments have accumulated into a thick layer. The wreckage of dozens of boats proves the price the American forces paid when landing on this island. Japanese heavy artillery, artillery, and rocket artillery are roaring day and night, spreading a barrage of shells on the beach, and their shooting is exceptionally accurate. This coast is composed of volcanic ash, and most vehicles sank deeply into it before advancing even ten feet, making it difficult to move, and the high rock walls on the coast also hinder the advance of vehicles, allowing the Japanese artillery fire to take advantage and shoot fiercely. Only a few trucks have landed in the two days, and all supplies are being transported to the front line by manpower. The large amphibious trucks that are deeply sunk in the gray sand are like pancakes fried in an iron pot. After the cranes used for unloading landed, they tipped to one side, and the cannons being unloaded were destroyed before they could be used. The subsequent vehicles also had no time to clear the way. Clothing packages, gas masks, sundries, etc., were mostly destroyed by Japanese shrapnel shells and scattered along a five-mile area, interspersed with countless broken guns and swords, as well as letters from American soldiers. War has truly penetrated human life. Death is soaring among the wreckage. The bodies of American soldiers on the beach are mostly buried in the sand by the waves." John Hoover, a spokesman for the US Central Pacific Front Headquarters, also said: "The Iwo Jima operation is the most difficult battle for the US military in the Pacific. When the Marine Corps landed, it was not initially resisted by heavy artillery fire, but the Japanese army immediately opened fire and attacked fiercely, and American tanks and soldiers were damaged and killed one after another, giving the impression that the landing stronghold was about to collapse. This battle is more difficult than the Battle of Saipan. In the first 57 hours after landing, the average number of casualties per hour was higher than in any battle in the Central Pacific to date."</p>
<p>Also, from a telegram from New York, BBC correspondent Hart Satchia broadcast the war situation on Iwo Jima from the flagship of Lieutenant General Taylor in the sea off Iwo Jima on the 22nd, saying: "An intense battle is currently unfolding on Iwo Jima that cannot be compared to any battle to date. The situation is tragic, and the island can be renamed Hell Island, which is hair-raising to say. I have witnessed the Marine Corps resolutely landing, crawling forward, and engaging in bayonet fighting with the Japanese army. This tactic requires extraordinary effort. The artillery battle between the Japanese and American sides never ceases throughout the night. If there is a hell in the world, then this Iwo Jima must be it. This landing operation is certainly not easy, and its difficulty is truly unexpected. Japanese mortars and heavy artillery barrages are everywhere. The landing craft destroyed on the beach are all over the place. A battle that can be compared to the Battle of Iwo Jima has never been seen before." (Lisbon Allied News Agency) (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi on February 25th)</p>

<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial situation in Shanghai has remained stable in the past week, with little change in transactions. The black market exchange rate fluctuated slightly, silver remained unchanged, and public bonds saw mixed gains and losses with weak trading. The stock market, on the other hand, has been improving due to the recent easing of credit, which is favorable to bulls. People are generally less concerned about buying stocks, so the stock market trend is improving daily, and trading is brisk. The prices of the three popular stocks are rising. The situation in various industries is also better than in the past. Although factories have not been able to fully resume production, it seems that the balance between supply and demand is being restored due to the small number of consumers. The transportation situation is better than before, and the difficulties in transporting local products have slightly decreased. The sources of rice, grains, oil, vegetables, and other raw materials are gradually becoming smoother, and people's livelihood is slightly stabilized. Market prices are generally stable. At the same time, the authorities' efforts to suppress prices have been effective, and speculation and hoarding have disappeared, so it is difficult to see a price surge again in the short term.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Increase Requested for Deposit Reserves</p>
<p>Banks and money shops in Shanghai have deposited a deposit reserve of 5% or more for fixed-term deposits and special current deposits, and 10% or more for current deposits, with the Central Reserve Bank, opening reserve accounts, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Implementation Rules of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. It is understood that the bankers' association believes that the interest rate on these deposits is very low, with a difference too large between that and the interest paid to depositors. They have jointly requested the Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank to increase the deposit interest rate. They have consulted twice, the first time agreeing to change the interest rate from 3% to 4%, but the second time the department has not yet approved the increase.</p>

<h3 id="e28">On Residential Electricity Consumption <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zhonghe</p>
<p>On February 28th, I received an electricity bill notification from the French Concession Electricity Company (usually received around the 20th, probably due to slow postal delivery). It stipulated electricity consumption limits, and these limits varied for each household. Even users with the same limit in the past were not the same this time. After inquiring and researching, I found the following calculations that are hard to understand (all users were previously not allowed to exceed 13 degrees).</p>
<p>1.  For those who did not use the full 13 degrees last month, the limit is calculated at half price, with a limit of less than 6.5 degrees.</p>
<p>2.  If three-tenths more were used last month, the new limit is 3.5 degrees.</p>
<p>3.  If six-tenths more were used, the limit is 3 degrees.</p>
<p>4.  If 2.7 degrees more were used, the limit is 3 degrees.</p>
<p>5.  If 2.5 degrees more were used, the limit is 4.5 degrees.</p>
<p>From the above records, it can be seen that the electricity company is penalizing those who are not sincerely assisting in conserving electricity. This penalty should be agreed with in principle, but monthly electricity consumption is calculated from the 8th of the month. Before receiving the new limit notification, users always assumed that the "limit was less than 6.5 degrees." Now, suddenly receiving this notification on the 28th, the penalized users will inevitably be greatly affected. Therefore, we hope that the company will have a flexible solution to this point.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Rice Market—Caohejing <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>The rice consumed by Shanghai residents is partly supplied by Caohejing. Therefore, Shanghai people have a deep impression of Caohejing.</p>
<p>The area does not produce rice. Its main products are cotton, soybeans, and vegetables. The reason it has become a rice distribution center is due to the inconvenience of transportation in recent years. Rice from Songjiang, Sijing, and other places cannot be directly transported to Shanghai, so it is transported to Caohejing by river, and then carried by rice traders to Shanghai. More than a thousand stones of rice pass through here every day. After the rice reaches Caohejing, it has already passed through many "checkpoints," so local market prices are not much different from those in Shanghai. For example, on the 16th of this month, market prices were: indica rice about 8,400 yuan per dou, ordinary Songjiang white rice about 8,800 yuan, and japonica rice about 9,100 yuan. Vegetables are relatively cheap, only 150 yuan per jin, while pork costs 800-900 yuan per jin.</p>
<p>Three Hopes</p>
<p>To understand the local situation, I interviewed Chen Xueyu, the head of Caohejing Township. He said, "The township has 18 bao, with about 9,000 residents, most of whom are farmers. There is one Caohejing Primary School, with about 300 students, which is run by the township office. The security situation is very good, with the First Battalion of the First Regiment stationed here." Talking about the difficulties of the township office and the decline of the local people's livelihood, Township Head Chen said he had three hopes: (1) He hopes that Shanghai charitable organizations will pay attention to the lives of the poor in the suburbs. There have never been porridge distributions or other charities in Caohejing. The 400 sets of winter clothing last winter were still requested by the township office from the Bureau of Social Welfare. (2) He hopes that Shanghai bankers will provide agricultural loans, as farmers urgently need funds now that spring plowing is approaching. (3) He hopes that the government authorities will consider the difficulties of the township office, because the township office has no funds and relies only on donations from local shops to maintain itself. The obligations it bears are very heavy. The supply of firewood alone requires 50-60 dan per month, not to mention other expenses.</p>
<p>Industrial Stagnation</p>
<p>Local land transportation includes the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and the Caobao Road to Qibao. Water transportation is the Caohe River, which connects to the Huangpu River in the east and Qibao, Sijing, and Songjiang in the west. Many rice boats and firewood boats arrive here every day. There are four rice mills, but recently, due to the suspension of motor electricity supply and the high cost of diesel engines, the amount of rice milled has been greatly reduced from more than 1,000 stones per day in the past. Few cotton gins are operating because the price of buying cotton is not enough to cover costs. As a result, farmers have had to switch to growing soybeans and vegetables, so cotton production has decreased compared to previous years. There is one small yarn factory, Xingnong Company, and one Dazhong Hosiery Factory. Before the war, local handicraft industries such as lace were very developed, but in recent years, maritime transportation has been blocked, and they have also been stagnant for a long time.</p>
<p>Social Service; Free Primary School Actively Promoted</p>
<p>Xie Lilin Suggests Setting Up a Free School Fund</p>
<p>The fact that this place is preparing to set up a free primary school has been briefly recorded in this column on the 15th. Our motivation stems from the previous winter vacation training meeting for primary school teachers to assist in the further studies of primary school teachers. The instructors explained carefully and their enthusiasm was commendable. The listening teachers humbly built their foundation, and the mood was harmonious. In this environment, two kinds of sympathy were jointly generated, one for the loss of schooling for poor students, and the other for the unemployment of some primary school teachers. Due to the development of sympathy, it was also jointly recognized that if unemployed teachers educate out-of-school children, it is a win-win situation. Based on the above views, after discussion, we asked this newspaper to run a free primary school. That is our motivation. As for our purpose, it is very simple, that is, to hope to achieve the education of out-of-school children by unemployed teachers.</p>
<p>In order to realize this work, we have set up a "Shen Bao Free Education Committee" to be responsible for handling it. The first meeting was held the other day, and opinions were fully exchanged on issues such as borrowing school buildings, selecting teachers, collecting books, setting courses, and budgeting expenses. We believe that this work originally requires the strength of the country or the strength of society to be effectively raised, and it is by no means something that a group or a few people can undertake. At the same time, we do not want to run it arrogantly or secretly. In the future, all work will be reported to society publicly at any time, and we hope that readers will give guidance and assistance.</p>
<p>The most urgent need at present is still the raising of funds. Although we have received the enthusiasm of the charity market sponsored by the four groups, and donated 1 million yuan for start-up expenses, however, based on our lowest estimate, the recurring expenses are still not enough. However, we are willing to actively promote the work first, in order to create facts that arouse the sympathy and support of people in society. Here, we will first publish Mr. Xie Lilin's loan for readers. Mr. Xie suggested opening a "Free School Fund" and first donated money to promote it. His suggestion and his enthusiasm are in line with our purpose. Of course, we hope that everyone will respond.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Lilin's Free School Fund</p>
<p>Mr. Xie wrote in his letter: "Recently, I saw the social service news in your newspaper and was pleased to learn that ten free primary schools were being run, on the one hand, to save children who had lost their schooling, and on the other hand, to subsidize the lives of teachers. The intention is excellent. But the need for free primary schools in Shanghai is more than just ten. The expenses required for free schools can hardly be met by the surplus funds from the charity market. This promotion of free education cannot be accomplished without the joint assistance of social people. I think that the reader's student aid fund founded by your newspaper has made remarkable achievements. Now, it is better to follow this method and open a free primary school student aid fund, abbreviated as "Free School Fund." Your newspaper serves society and is known for its reputation. With a call, the donations for the "Free School Fund" will surely come in a steady stream. I will donate 10,000 yuan in savings bonds, which I have saved from my daily savings, to be used as the "Reader's Free School Fund." This small amount is not enough to promote, but I hope to lead the way and respond together, so that out-of-school children can be made into useful talents, which is a great blessing for society and a great blessing for the country. Xie Lilin, March 16th"</p>
<h3 id="e30">Recommendations on the Evacuation of Fellow Villagers from Hebei and Shandong <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Keqiu</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai has been publishing some news about the evacuation of the population in the newspapers every day. Originally, there were many people who wanted to return to their hometown, but most of them were watching and waiting because it was difficult to buy train tickets and problems often occurred along the way. Now, I have prepared the following measures for the evacuation of citizens from Hebei and Shandong provinces for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Those who evacuate voluntarily (fellow villagers) should first register with the fellow villager association, and then hand over the train fare to the designated bank in exchange for a receipt.</p>
<p>(2) The fellow villager association shall submit a request to the Evacuation Committee to handle the purchase of tickets and arrange transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Women and children are allowed to be accompanied by eleven men, but adult men are not allowed to be accompanied by adult men, in order to prevent single travelers from mixing in. Returnees must have a return permit, and escorts are exempt.</p>
<p>(4) Publish a notice to exchange bank receipts for official train tickets, and issue certificates to be hung on the front of the outer clothing. Every ten people form a team, and elect a team leader to take care of the women and children along the way. Seats should be given to women and children as much as possible. The fellow villager association shall elect a chief commander to escort them to Shandong and Hebei provinces. In case of accidents, the orders of the chief commander must be obeyed.</p>
