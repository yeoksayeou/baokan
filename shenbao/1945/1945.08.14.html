<h3>日東鄉外相　再晋宮覲見</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日東鄕外相十三日下午二時十分進宮，謁見日皇陛下，奏呈所管事項。</p>
<h3>從科學上研究　原子炸彈</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　關於美國之使用原子炸彈，十三日之讀賣新聞著文加以論述，題爲「天文學的爆炸力，招致人類滅亡的暴君」。其大旨云，新炸彈具有劃期的威力，其非人道行爲，遠較毒瓦斯爲烈。美國使用此種新兵器，自經日本向美國提出抗議後，乃大白於世。依據美總統特魯曼九日之廣播，此種新式炸彈，即係美國自誇之「原子炸彈」。準是以論，數年前曾一時轟動世界學界之宇宙綫——原子核破壞之實騐，於今成爲人類有史以來之殺戮兵器，而露面於今次大戰矣。原子炸彈究係何物？茲引述原子學權威某博士的談話如次：「原子者，係物質構成之最初階段，於中心原子核之四週，陽子與中性子，以驚人之速度廻轉，一方則互相緊密結合，但紫外錢與其同類之　鈾等等之原子，循自然狀態，由原子核中分離中性子，飛出空中，於多年間變化爲其他物質，此即所謂放射性原素。當其與具有放射性能之鐳錠相接觸時，即能引起大傷害，此爲公認之事實。施用所謂磁氣的共鳴加速器，就能人工的破壞此種原子核。因上述方法，可使中性子的運行加速，而發極大之高熱。再令此種中性子與鈾等之原子核碰觸，可使原子核瞬間發生重大之變化。根據此項原理，以人工破壞原子核時，其四面發散之力，鉅大至於無法計算，原子炸彈即係利用此項鉅大的力量所製造。倘使利用鈾的原子破壞力。可以獲得天文學的爆發力，即比較普通火藥或揮發油燈之爆發力，增大數千萬倍甚至一億倍。</p>
<h3>艦載機八百架　襲關東各地　判明擊落毀四十餘架</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　據日軍訊，十三日來襲關東地區之敵艦載機，關於戰果，頃已調查中，而據東部車管區司令部發表，截至是日上午十一時，已擊落八架，擊毀十六架。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　敵機動部隊艦載機，十三日上午五時餘起至下午五時半，執拗來襲關東各地區，福島，新潟等地，對市街地加以盲目轟炸，日方有若干損害，日軍制空部隊對之加以果敢攻擊，至下午六時止，判明之戰果計擊落敵機十七架（包括PByS型一架），擊毀達二十五架以上。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　敵艦載機羣十三日晨五時來襲關東地區東北地方南部及北部方面，主要對機塲軍事設施加以攻擊，截至上午十時，累計敵機約達八百架。</p>
<p>九州各地擊落八架</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　冲繩基地B25型機約七十架，B38型機約二十架，P51，P47型等小型機約百四十架及飛艇五架編成之戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊約二百三十架，十二日上午十一時半起，更另有戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊八十餘架，由下午一時起，分散侵入九州各地，以機槍掃射交通設施，一部市街地及船舶等，至正午止，查明日方戰果擊落敵機八架。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　十二日上午十一時半許，P49型機三十二架，經四圍東南端附近來襲良縣北部。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰爭與人道問題</h3>
<p>國際間對於戰爭過程中，戰爭手段上，本有關於制止非人道行爲的規定。但是自第一次世界大戰以來，交戰各國仍時有違反人道的作戰方法，及施用非人道的戰鬥工具的行爲。我們對於今日交戰國使用預知要大量傷及無事生命的武器者，不能不表示遺憾而提出抗議。</p>
<p>在這次戰爭中，除了我們會經偶然聽到交戰國使用毒氣，致累及非交戰員及大轟炸中累及無辜民衆之外，雖然各方面都有新兵器之使用，但是大體上說，使用毒氣一事尙未能證實，而後者則事實上有不可完全避免者，照普通的轟炸的效力而言，其爲害的範圍與程度，雖然不能說不慘酷，究竟還有一定的限度，而且雙方非戰鬥員，也儘有疏散及掩蔽與逃避辦法，有時爲着早日結束戰爭，以取得永久和平，大規模的恐怖性的神經性的轟炸，或許在戰略上及政略上有其重大價値，但事實上任何恐怖轟炸，決不能對於戰爭發生決定的作用，已有許多事實可爲證明。</p>
<p>現在敵美方面在對盟邦日本作戰中，竟使用一種所謂原子炸彈的新武器，這種武器施用在廣島的空襲，而使廣島受莫大損失，我們不論廣島之地位與價値，而必出於此種行動，施用此種武器，但據我們所可獲得的消息，廣島是一和平的小城市，而結果死傷的全是無辜的和平民衆，那麼，試問美軍使用此種殺傷力驚人巨大而有使全市化爲廢墟之力的原子炸彈，其用意究竟何在？其結果之有背於正義與人道，將來美國人將何以對全世界自圓其說？</p>
<p>可是，從報道看來，駐華美軍總司令魏德曼中將在本月九日，竟向新聞記者發表，原子炸彈有襲擊上海的可能，我們更不解這種宣言在恐嚇在華中的日軍，還是意在向上海數百萬中國人民示威？而事實上，原子炸彈的殺傷及破壞力，决不能在人民與兵隊之間有所選擇，則這種宣言之用意，只有引起數百萬上海中國人民的憤慨而已！和平區政府率領人民所抗拒的，只是英美帝國主義的侵略軍隊，而美國駐華總司令則竟公然發表向中國平民挑釁的威嚇，我們在這裏更可明瞭誰是爲人道而戰了！</p>
<p>關於原子炸彈的不人道行爲，日本巳向美國提出正式抗議，即英國人士對於此事，亦多表示不滿，而九日倫敦紀事報刊出某讀者的要求，速將此獻媚於殘殺人類惡魔之科學者處以死刑。我們明知一切抗議也許不會生效，但我們希望全世界一切國家的人民輿論起而反對此種非人道的轟炸。</p>
<h3>對近海機動部隊　日空軍反覆攻擊　同時逐日強化邀擊態勢</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　敵美機動部隊，十三日在關東東方洋上出擊，晨起對關東地方實施彼狀空襲，對此，日航空部隊於是日下午起，加以反覆攻擊。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　自七月下句起至八月上句，曾由日本士沿岸暫時退去之敵美機動部隊，再度來擊，於九日以約一千七百架之艦載機攻擊東北地方，十日又以約一千六百架對關東東北地方實施空　。十三日自晨起亘關東地區執拗展開作戰，敵機動部隊現在之位置，係在犬吠崎東方洋上，可推定其勢力大槪爲三集團左右。至上午十時正，來襲機數約達八百架，然最近敵由雷伊泰方面逐次實行移動兵力，至本月上旬集結艦船約四艘，似已吿竣事。與此同時，觀察敵潛水艦在日本土沿岸之行動狀况等，敵之侵寇本土企圖，極爲露骨化，日軍正嚴重監視敵之行動，同時，邀擊敵軍態勢，亦逐日强化。</p>
<p>美戰艦等沉沒八艘</p>
<p>前綫基地十三日中央社電　本年三月初句，日潛水部隊在中部太平洋方面，擊毀敵戰艦一艘，其後經確認該戰艦已擊沉。</p>
<p>前綫基地十三日中央社電　日潛水部隊七月下旬起至八月上旬，於冲繩東南方海域擊沉毀敵運輸船三艘，驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美陸軍部十一日發表稱：美潛艦布西畢號，驅逐艦卡蘭千號業已喪失。布西畢號係於去年未曾返港，當已喪失，卡蘭干號係於冲繩海域被擊沉者。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　華盛頓電，美海軍部十一日發表：護送驅逐艦安達爾號，一四〇〇噸，於菲律賓近海沉沒，艦員一一二名完全戰死。</p>

<h3>蘇北海門一瞥</h3>
<p>— 瑜之</p>
<p>海門——這江海沖積的一塊沙陸，它正式於中國的版圖上出現，還只有一百八十多年的歷史，在這百餘年間，經崇明，南通等地陸續移民過來，在他們久歷刻苦辛勤的努力　發之下，才成今日的一片肥沃陸土。它地位蘇北的最東南方，南濱揚子江，東枕黃海，北隣南通，東南便是啓東和崇明島了。今日的海門正是蘇北淸鄉地區之一，現有八個自治行政區，居民一四七三○九戶，總人口爲六五三九二四。</p>
<p>治安與民生</p>
<p>現在海門的治安情形，一般的說，較之未淸鄉以前顯然已有相當改進，以前縣政府只有五個行政區能行使政令，不消說其餘三區是新四軍蟠踞所在的游擊區域，淸鄕以後，現在都已全部歸復爲和平之鄕了。舉凡保甲編查，自衛訓練，封鎖管理，賦稅調整等等，也巳推行了將近二年。同時現在負着全縣治安責任的武力，有保安隊數百人，武裝警察數百人，友軍警備隊千餘人，分駐各區鄉較重要之市鎭據點，但一向作爲和建工作的破壞者的新四軍，仍是死灰燃地活躍於偏僻地區。</p>
<p>民衆負一方而也是捐稅重重，名目繁多，田賦是實物征收，每畝征棉花五斤，元麥八斤，大約現在折價在三千元左右的樣子，其他國稅省稅當然不必說了，各地皆然，此外還有所謂特捐，如軍警給養，保甲費，自衛團費，區鄉鎭公所，一切支出的攤派費，甚至連一層層官長活動交際應酬費等，也要巧立名目派到老百姓頭上去，還有新四軍的「公糧」是普遍的，比政府出賦還要征的凶。</p>
<p>農產與土布</p>
<p>海門物產以棉花雜糧爲大宗，尤以棉花一項產量最富，足與產棉著名之南通相伯仲，在最盛時代經營棉花集散之大小花行有百餘十家之多，近一二年因雜糧成爲奇貨以後，產量已每況愈下了，至於所產雜糧大半爲居民主要食用之元麥，苞米，大豆次之，其他如小麥，高粱，小豆，　豆，落花生等又次之，種稻則可說百無僅有了。這些雜糧在從前祇供給本地食用猶尙不足，中上人家大都採用外來白米爲主要食糧，近年因交通欠暢，外來食糧不易獲取後，目前種植雜糧的已大大的增加，不僅自給，而且也有餘量來輸給上海了。此外由於棉花出產之普遍，小型的半手工的棉績商特別的多，加之近年外來棉織品之輸入不多，因此這裏的土布反成爲大宗輸出品之一了，最近有所謂改良土布之出品，這是一種非常進步的出品，樣子相當從前上海三友實業社之自由呢，顏色深淺紗支粗細有好幾種，旣大方又經濟，每尺市價四百元至五百元，當地非常風行。</p>
<p>物價跳動劇烈</p>
<p>海門雖也稱得上一句物產豐富，然而一般的物價也受上海市塲之一呼一吸，跳動得非常激烈，幾種主要物品如麥，米，柴，油，魚，肉，蔬菜以及各種五洋日用品也莫不步步飛漲，大約這裏最普通的個人生活費，最低限度每月必須四萬元左右，這僅是指個人伙食及剪髮洗衣等項而言，衣着房金均不在其內。此地的房屋雖未受上海疏散的影響，返鄉者寥寥無幾，但在縣市區要租一間像樣些房子也不大容易，即使幸運找到，房租也貴的駭人，實物計算至少一間斗米，現在米價每間每月須化萬五千元的房金，房東還說：「逍麼一點房金算得什麼，若以房子代價的本錢放出去，二角個洋，五頭六十萬元要有近十萬一月的利息呢！」（註：俗稱二角個洋即每月每洋二角取息之謂）海門居着實亦不易哩！</p>
<p>文化與教育</p>
<p>這裏的文化：全縣有縣私立中小學校百二三十個單位，在籍學生約二萬多，單以縣市就有四個中學，五個小學，均有三百至五百的學生，內容私校較優於縣校，其中以私立錫類中小學建築設備最優，講到辦理成績則以能仁中學及海霞中學要算翹楚了。私立學校學雜費以元麥實物收取，收額又貴，中學生須繳一担至担半，小學生三斗至六斗，故私校收入足以自給而有餘，平均中學敎師可以拿二一至三担半一月，小學敎師一一至二一（現在麥價每担四萬五千元），這個待遇較之縣立學校敎師及一般中下級公務員，尙拿萬元至二萬多元一月的薪水，半死不活的艱困萬狀，他們可以傲睨儕輩吧。</p>
<p>縣市尙有良敎館一所，每月經費七萬餘元，館負五人，每人只拿八千至一萬元一月的薪水，內備日報五六種，另有圖書流通部，圖畫近千册，貧乏得很，僅此而已。縣市書店有好幾家，却奇怪並不賣書，只有文具紙張之類，道裹唯一供應新鮮精神食糧的，倒是一個滿街亂呌的趙姓的報阪子，所有上海各家日報他都有，按期分送各定戶，月終取錢，其中以申報，新中國報在這裏閱戶最多。他還兼賣雜誌新書，書如結婚十年，傳奇，一士類稿，中國內幕等，雜　如春秋，申報月刋，大衆，天地，雜誌等，銷路均不惡，可惜價錢太貴，日報賣近三千元一月，新書雜誌總要照碼加倍或二倍的賣。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>日陸軍省昨發表　李鍝公殿下晋級　小沢曹長等授予感狀</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日天皇陛下對六日進行作戰任務中之陸軍中佐李鍝公殿下於敵機空襲廣島時負傷，七日戰死，爲紀念其功績，已予進級及論功行賞，十三日由賞勳局及陸軍省發表如次（陸軍省十三日發表）：陸軍中佐李鍝公，升任陸軍大佐，陸軍大佐大勳位李鍝公，叙功三級，授金　勳章，賜木杯一套。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日陸軍省十三日發表，昭和二十年一月九日數呂宋島孟加爾達附近，數次粉碎敵之來冠，且果敢突擊，急襲敵轟炸機不時降陸地點，收獲多大戰果之陸軍曹長小沢　等四名，　由非島方面軍最高指揮官山下奉文授與感狀，今復奏聞天皇陛下。</p>
<h3>義大利缺糧　情勢頗嚴重　總選舉定十一月舉行</h3>
<p>百倫十三日中央社電　據巴黎電訊：現正在法國襄助推進法社會主義黨集會之義大利代理自相納尼，日前正式宣稱：「將於此十一月中開始總選舉之義大利國民議會，今將決意推翻君主制建立共和國，目前我人極相信左翼政黨，決將能於國民議會中獲得絕對之多數」。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據紐約泰晤士報特派訪員報吿稱：於五閱月後若有人再至義大利巡遊一次，必將驚異莫名，蓋兩年來宣佈停戰之義大利，其千鈞一髮之時即將來臨。現在羅馬之義民衆對將在倫敦舉行之各國外長會議，寄予甚大之希望，同時彼等又深盼聯合國方面與義大利簽訂和約，能不涉及紛爭已久之國境問題·殖民地問題·賠償及軍事整頓等一時決難獲得解決之問題，而應立刻商討有關整個義大利之嚴重局勢。即目前冬季即將來臨，對大部份義大利民衆之生存威脅日益加重，糧食之不足，煤斤之缺乏，運輸之不良，失業者之增多，俱爲義次利人民目前最大且最難解決之問題。同時現在義大利盛傳駐於義大利之聯合國軍即將撤退，國民議會之總選舉即將舉行，於是人心皇皇不可終日，義大利北部地區雜亂之情形尤甚。</p>
<h3>中央黨部　舉行紀念週</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　中國國民黨中央黨部，十三日上午十時在該部大禮堂舉行第二六二次總理紀念週，到中央執監委員，中央然部全體工作同志，並政府機關國民黨員共約六百餘人，由副部長巫蘭溪主席，行禮如儀後，並由委員周化人報吿，題爲「戰局變遷後之對共問題」，作詳盡之申述。報告畢，津浦鐵路特別黨部執監委員舉行宣誓典禮，中央特派組織部副部長巫關溪監誓並致訓詞，至十一時許禮成散會。</p>
<h3>美蘇勢力角逐　禍根潛伏</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　紐約時報之中國特派員阿本德曾謂，即令中國之一部無論其名義爲何，如果受蘇聯之支配，則予亞洲之影響誠極深刻，以故「赤色」狂潮之危險性逐加濃厚云。美國之此種憂　，現已化爲事實。八月九日終於揭下假面具之蘇聯，突然宣言參加對日作戰，蘇聯軍已突破滿蘇國境。無論其名義如何，蘇聯之參戰，對於抗戰之渝延兩方，各予以意義不同之强烈衝動，至此今後蘇聯將得自由恣意干涉中國之政治及軍事問題，此種現象，洵乃美國最大之一憂也。同時以美國爲後盾，期待解決對延問題之渝方，對於延安因蘇聯參戰，驟然擴大發言權一事，頗感苦惱。戰後之歐洲，美蘇對立益趨深刻，此種情形茲又復出現於中國。値此政治危急之際，蘇聯宣言參戰一舉，使美蘇於中國之勢力，發生空前之變化。史太林元帥深信，即使蘇聯轉向一國社會主義，而中國之革命於木資上亦與蘇聯相結，又嗾使延安採取與帝國主義鬥爭，反對侵略戰爭之狡猾手段，此不外所謂統一中國抗日戰綫之一種僞裝，煽動中國與日戰爭。此種政策，雖於今日亦毫未改變，故其於將來，常然與美國之對華政策，亦即帝國主義之資本主義之侵略勢力，必發生衝突。而延安政權則深悟蘇聯之動向，與國際政局以及所謂世界戰局之客觀條件上利害，是以一方强調與重慶之合作，而一方面又企圖向渝方伸張其勢力，事實上延安與蘇聯之政治思想方面均有連繫，而日軍事方面之連繫亦爲時不達也。且實現此事之日，即爲美國對華政策崩潰之日，是以該問題將爲第三次世界大戰之核心也。</p>
<h3>蒙納特檢察官　歷數貝當罪狀　力主依法處以死</h3>
<p>百倫十三日中央社電　據巴黎電訊：前維希政府元首貝當，於週六被蒙納特檢察官要求處以死刑，茲渠之辯護士決將力爲貝常之生命抗辯。而蒙納特堅持向衆宣佈，略謂，「對國事犯之唯一懲處乃爲死刑，且我法國之律法，決不能以罪犯之年齡而有所更改。停戰協定之簽訂，足使我法國陷於恥辱，破毀國家之威信，忍受戰敗，奴役於（德）敵國，而况實施對英國攻擊，不忠不義，佐助軸心方自沉艦船，且絕無義恥，反使我法國軍官人員服德軍服飾。有此項罪名，我實未知再能有寬恕減輕懲罰之處，茲我法庭爲一引用法律之地，決應對一切罪犯依法懲治。</p>
<h3>英丹簽訂　通商協定</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十三日中央社電　據哥本哈根訊：英國與丹麥通商協定，曾經十日之交涉始畢，關於物資交流及金融措置之協定，雙方業已簽字。</p>
<h3>希臘新閣成立</h3>

<h3>今後中國敎育的進路</h3>
<p>— 李鐸融</p>
<p>國家富强，端在敎育，欲知敎育成敗，須察環境動囚，始能興敎育，民元以來，內憂外患，歲無寗日，政治不上軌道，經濟瀕於破產，敎育焉能不受影響！我國目前敎育，乃承五四運動之後，雖無長足進步，而較之淸末民元時代，總勝一籌，惟回顧前瞻，作有一系統之淸算，則知今後我國敎育必要大行革命，始能造就人材，與社會情景而能調整，舉賢任能，始能掃除孵化積習，勵　圖治，始能醫愈學生貧血。今日整個敎育不能左右時局，反被捲入潮流漩渦，倘不急謀改進，民族文化不行崩潰，次代國民不失民族眞相者未之有也。西哲有云，學校者小國家也，能治校者亦能治國，焉有學校不佳，而國家能興盛乎？</p>
<p>敎育之重要性</p>
<p>强化敎育機構，立定中心思想：吾聞孟子有云：「飽食煖衣，而無敎化，則近於禽獸矣」。可見人無敎育，不能爲人，國無敎育，不能維國。昔查理曼大帝，藉敎育團結羅　成聖帝國，毛奇將軍以小學敎員爲普國勝法之造因，滑鐵盧之役，　靈吞歸功於易頓學校學生棒球之比賽，日勝俄敗，伊藤博文誇獎日本小學，蓋俄革命成功，謂「書籍勝過炸彈」，是强化敎育機構，爲國家常强之本，不待知者而知矣。</p>
<p>強化敎育機構</p>
<p>夫敎育旣如利器，所以列强莫不統制敎育，蓋工欲善其事，必先利共器，由是敎育機構不能獨立，因其爲政府利用，故有時則失敎育之作用，倘敎育而能獨立，思想走上正軌，國家危難之秋，學者則能出爲挽救，試觀方孝孺不草燕王即位詔，雖被夷十族而不畏，文天祥慷慨就義，抱　尤寫「讀聖賢書所學何事」，敎皇違法獨裁，路德能謀宗敎革命，美洲人　破產，林有能出釋放黑奴，東印度公司壓迫印人，博克Burke反爲印人請命，此從個人思想自由方面言之，勢有「三軍可以奪帥，匹夫不可以奪志」之力。即以國際方面言之，古代希臘，羅馬，敎育自由，厥後國權雖喪，而若輩敎育仍能埀傳不息，較之今日歐洲敎育家在政府鐵蹄之下，與國同亡毫無聲色者，奚啻天壤之別哉！我國敎育素主「學優而仕」，得志則進爲致君澤民，不得志則退爲人民導師，終身以政敎爲生活，倘官僚政客隨意可以盤踞敎育機關，邪說異端隨時可進課堂演講，地棍流氓任意干涉敎權，則敎育不能獨立，學者焉能爲中流砥柱？勢必隨政治轉移，蓋任何政治，黑　多而光明少，敎育安能求其進步？我故曰：今後中國敎育欲謀進路，必須强化敎育機構，實行獨立，一也。</p>
<p>涵養民族意識</p>
<p>民族語言（白話文），爲團結民族之要素，我政府自當學令推行，以冀將來打倒南腔北調，且敎育部須製定國語標準頒行全國以資遵守，否現代語體文書太無文法規律，安能造成優美語言？惟白話文隨時變更，五十年前之白話文與今不同，二百年後之人讀今日之白話文或如外國語，蓋楚泰Cha　ueer與莎士比亞之英文，今人不懂，視之無異法文，任何民族方言都能改變，不能保留國粹埀傳永久，故需要另一不變之文字如拉丁文希臘文。我國古文現已改變淺現，全國大報均用此種時文，凡是國人散處任何地方，一讀便知，且能　傳永遠不變，誠足保留國粹，凡歷史，傳記，紀念碑文，頌詞，並一切留傳後世之文字，都要取用時文，我以爲初中以下學校，一切教科書均要用語體文言，惟高中與大學必須專用時文，由是始能讀說古代文書，涵養民族意識，二也。</p>
<p>普及兒童敎育</p>
<p>我國素重宗法社會，崇拜祖先，人民心目中只有家庭而無國家觀念，政治除三代盛世外，仁政之時間少，人民長官吏如虎狼，安能愛國，茍非組織民意政府，實行保民，輔以公民訓練，使盡國民天職，國家焉得保存？今日列强婚姻破產，我國組織惟有家庭最佳，修齊平治，乃我絕好格言，離婚娶妾務要剷除，此家庭敎育必須發展，蓋兒童六歲以內之敎育，能影響其終身品格，未有家庭敎育不佳，而學校能臻美善者也，民族敎育，愛國運動，請由兒童着手，三也。</p>
<p>現學制的缺點</p>
<p>改良現行學制，自創實用敎育：杜威云：敎育者人類生活也，生活隨時長大，隨境而變，適合環境者則得生存，違逆自然者受其淘汰，所以敎育之宗旨，系統，設施，方針，不能固定，隨地方之文化，經濟而異，西洋敎育制度，未必能合我國，都市敎育未必適用於農村，自由敎育施之於無法治習慣之子弟，適足爲患，功利敎育行之於無這德人民，無異虎豹加冀，享樂敎育加之於窮困國家，速其破產，唯物敎育置之於無神主義，則橫行無忌，共產敎育放之於懶惰靑年，則長其淫逸。</p>
<p>改良現行學制</p>
<p>敎師無異醫師，必須相時奪勢，按症下藥，否則敎育萬能——足以興邦，亦足亡國——我國學制，材料，全係抄襲，其中有許多學非所用，用非所學，與社會格格不入，今後理宜考察地方需要，製定實用課程，合國家之情况，編訂學章，例如某大學欲查商業敎育，施行以下辦法：　調查此地有多少商舖，　每舖須用多少人員，　工作需要如何準備，　每年有多少人員交替。一切類集報吿，然後該大學始設商科，以致人材與社會需耍無不調整，此改良學制之大槪也。敎育原欲修改人民缺點，愚者智之，弱者健之，惡者馴之，濁者潔之，貪者廉之，怯者勇之，怠者激之。</p>
<p>關於敎師訓練</p>
<p>敎師不知靑年人心理，不按「科學法測騐」考察，專憑臆見與經騐行事，每多不知實情，今後黨敎者須有專門學識，特別訓練，敎材如何選擇，課程如何增減，設備如何合法，校景如何布置，考績如何公平，用人如何適當，學生如何團契，學業如何進步，弊端如何改革，一切敎務非「測量」實證，決不妄行，由是始能除腐化之積習，發起新敎育精神，如此辦學何學不興，如此敎人何人不化，新敎育運動非從人民需要，學校供應方面着手，決難收其成效。總之，以狹義言之，誰都可辦學，以廣義言之，非專門訓練，才德兼擾之志士不可。</p>
<p>貧窮乃我國今日之大患，窮原因孔多，惟政治不上軋道，生產無從保障，爲第一原因。例如華僑在外經營，滿載而歸，投資國內多數破產，未有知識，安能製造，故「愚」亦爲窮之造因，强迫敎育，掃除文盲，雖可除「愚」，而推行敎育，非財不可，故「窮」仍爲禍魁，禮義廉恥誰都愛惜，彼貪汚豈無良心。不過被迫於「窮」，一人掙錢，一二十人寄食，迫而達到「家中一人爲佛雞狗登仙」。蓋衣食足而後禮義生，倘不設法去窮，雖駡貪汚不輟亦無濟於事矣。且我國臨時敎育，專講性理，倫常，敎人如何作人，而不敎人如何養人。</p>
<p>生產敎育方法</p>
<p>所謂「士志於道而恥惡衣惡食者未足與議也」，所謂生產之道。不過昇官發財—書中自有黃金屋，書中自有顏如玉，萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高－此種救育救人貪污者也。今後切勿再蹈覆轍。愚竊以為第一步驟，須先除學界之名稱－士農工商，五四運動以後，見士不能生產，改為農工商學，仍有未安，蓋讀書是人人權利，則人人均係學界，故最好改為農工商政，一面打倒貪圖作官之陋習，一而提倡生產敎育。試觀吾人自頂至足，生活之用物，無一非舶來品，土木工程材料，儘皆外人出產，甚至一綫一針之術，亦皆外國產物，如此生產落後，救死不暇，安能談及富國強兵。</p>
<p>生產教育方法</p>
<p>生產敎育方法甚多，如多設職業學校－商科，水產，造林，農學，工學，牧畜，製造，機械，製藥，開　，筆難枚舉，從前輕視勞工，今後必須矯正，學生勤勞服務隊，與輪流春耕之法，可洗刷弱士之恥乃臨時提倡勤勞計劃究非根本辦法，我以為欲生產，必須養成勤勞習慣。自小學至大學，每年設有勞作必修科，每日至少以二小時，由教師指導工作。一則勞以筋骨，以健體格，一則敎以技術。增高效率，一也。學校設有勞作介紹部，凡有招聘雜工者，指定課餘之後，代為介紹，使學生自給，減輕父母祖負，二也。校內　掃洗刷，建築挖掘，園藝，修補，盡可能之範圍，不屆校了，只用學生服務，給以工資，使能自立，三也。課外設以生活課程，訓練勞作技術，非經訓練部位派遣，四也。以上生產敎育，美國學校早已實行，可資效法。</p>
<p>掃除文盲：文盲不除，社會則無敎育可言而稱佔世界人口四份一之人力最大國家——四萬萬五千萬之中，幾乎有四萬萬人民目不識了；兼以文字艱深，望之生畏，作文抽象化，區區數字，包含意義孔深，非咬字嚼文，難明其意；故我國書籍內，雖具有現代一切學說，而反要借重西學；古人雖發明科學各種技能，而後代不能繼續，遂至舍己芸人，事事抄襲，今後寫字必須簡易化，作文演繹化，語言普通化，運用利便化，抄寫迅速化，教法現代化，管理平民化，令人一讀即知，節時省力，藉以多作他事。</p>
<p>並要嚴定五年計劃，普及敎育，這者主管機關與兒童保護者，均受相當處分，蓋惟有全國人民識字，政令始能雷厲風行。</p>
<p>提高師資程度</p>
<p>欲望敎育邁進，爲今之計：（一）常提高師資程度，嚴格訓練：按最近外國限制師範入學考試：　靑年男女須具高尙之性格。　體格健全而有可敬之相貌。　態度適宜而不浮躁。　才幹充足，自信能任教師天職。　大學份數不能達B者不准進敎育學院。　四年畢業者爲小學教員，五年畢業者爲中學敎員，非有國內外名校碩士以上學位者不准爲大學教授。（二）教師事業，地位神聖：凡得有第一條文憑資格者，政府任爲終身教師，即被停聘者亦當用爲敎育行政公務員，年老時由政府發給養老費用，務使勵：凡敎師成績優美者，經十五年一賞，三十年一褒，五十年賜以第一品榮　。（四）救師不但有學術自由言論之權，而且在教室中有管理處分之權，校長不能干涉，以上製造師資之四法，諒能挽回敬師衛道之風，令人獻身爲敎育服務，幸勿河漢斯言！</p>
<p>達成三民敎育</p>
<p>敎育宗旨，不止養成知識，按能，而且要注意三養——養堅强之心志而能知行合一；養愛美之天性，而　一切惡行；養火熟之氣力，而能邏輯奮鬥。在生活方面又能提高效率——如何謀生自給，如何養活家計，如何利用自然資源，如何生財救　，謂之生產敎育，以達三民敎育目的，至於「愚爲萬惡之根」，敎育必須普及，「師如君父」，師嚴而後道尊，我國今後敎育前途遠大，邁進無邊，有志之士曷興乎來。</p>

<h3>島田中佐談滿蘇國境戰事　日滿兩軍沈著應戰中</h3>
<p>上海弘報部於昨（十三）日下午四時，循例舉行報道常會，到島田陸軍中佐·勝野　記官·鬆本　軍大尉等，由島田中佐就滿蘇國境戰爭，作綜合之觀測。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>滿鮮國境展開激戰</p>
<p>目前滿洲國關東軍之作戰，在東西北三方面。蘇聯軍從東西北之正面向滿洲國境內侵犯，在西方正面南方，蘇軍從外蒙古鳥珠穆沁向林西進犯。在北方之蘇軍部隊，已侵入滿洲裏，沿齊齊哈爾之鐵路線侵犯海拉爾，該地之北面三河，亦有蘇軍部隊來攻，與犯滿洲裏之蘇軍在海拉爾會師，其週圍刻正展開激戰中。尚有一部份，蘇軍企圖爭奪索倫。在黑河南之蘇軍，及在奇克之一部份部隊，刻向前推進中。關於進犯東部虎頭之蘇軍部隊，沿虎林線侵攻虎林。在東方正面之南，綏芬河東　及在綏芬之部分，經綏陽伸達穆稜。在　　慶興與朝鮮國境方面，則經雄基而在羅當附近發生戰鬥中。在各正面之戰線，關東軍已與官民協國一致，展開激擊戰。</p>
<p>日軍作戰將有進展</p>
<p>此外尚有一部份蘇航空部隊呼應陸上部隊侵襲，向滿洲國內重要都市，如佳木斯·牡丹河·哈爾濱·新京·吉林等一帶，實行少數機之空襲，或向陸上攻擊。至於蘇聯侵犯兵力，至今猶未接獲確切數目之報道，綜觀現在戰況，並無大量兵力，在西方之正面或有一部份機械化部隊侵攻，故目前欲判斷今後敵方之企圖，尚屬過早。今以三方面作戰之地形而論，在東部正面，以綏芬河與東寧爲中心之一帶戰鬥，多爲高地，地形險要，故在此作戰，不論敵我雙方均感困難。其次在與凱湖北之虎林戰線，除完　山嶺山脈外，直至北方近蘇境之哈巴洛夫斯克之對岸一帶，　　個之山嶺外，濕地頗多，澤水　　。其北　黑　江流域，沿接國境地帶，平地稀少，此外　小興山嶺山脈高　，在北方之　　　海拉爾戰線，用爲　　北省，草原　地，即屬著名之大興安嶺山脈，極　方　林西戰線，與外蒙山脈連　，直至中滿國境爲止。舉凡在各該戰線戰鬥之關東軍，均就其地形具有相當之訓練，今後應付敵人，在作戰上必有相當之　　，　　當前之關東軍　來攻之敵，沈著迎　，必予以痛　。</p>
<h3>違反燈火管制決取斷然處置　防空本部當局發表談話</h3>
<p>本市市民防空本部，爲嚴格執行燈火管制，發表談話，　謂：“連日來因市民曲解戰局，將燈火管制，予以疏忽，殊爲抱　。查至目今整個大東亞尚在戰爭狀態中，市民自應適應戰時體　，並體會當局之意旨，堅強民防空陣，且經常之警戒燈火管制，自　　執行中，市民自應確切遵照實施，於每晚十時後，仍須入於警戒燈火管制狀態，絕對避免燈火　漏，各種撥販於十時前營業時，亦須使用防空用燈，十時後一律停止營業，即各項車輛，自亦應實施車輛燈火管制，以　敵機之侵襲，而保衛大上海之安全。瑞軍警當局，已會同保甲自　團，組織燈火管制取締班，嚴厲澈查。本部亦已抱斷然態度，與軍警當局同樣處置，對違反燈火管制者，決採取嚴厲之連坐制，當場斷電處分，務望市民自相監視，對故違者，可向各該管警察分局檢舉罰辦，免遭無辜被累之虞。尚有其他防空設施，亦仍須整頓，絕對不得有所破壞，如違亦須解交軍警當局依法嚴辦”。</p>
<h3>警局勸止懸掛國旗</h3>
<p>警察局當局爲勸止懸掛國旗，發表談話雲：最近本市各區，發現有懸掛國旗情事，查國旗爲代表國家之標織，我等所應切實尊重而不應輕率　用者，且諸位亦所熱知。現有各種謠言流布於巷聞，各位市民置身此境，應自重自戒，保持冷靜沈著態度，而掛國旗之舉，宜自行慎止。</p>
<h3>銀錢業決定照常收付</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業同業公會，以各銀行錢莊業務，關係市面及各業至鉅，　於日前召開銀錢業臨時緊急聯席會議，決議對於各行莊業務上之措置，暫定辦法如下：</p>
<p>㈠各行莊對客戶存款照常收付。（甲）客戶不論以票據或現鈔存入時，各行莊均予照收。（乙）各行莊所有收入現鈔聊列作庫存外，得隨時存入中儲行或銀聯會或錢庫。</p>
<p>㈡各行莊對客戶放款，放爲其用途非屬正常，或不必要，或足以助長投機者，均應一律停止。</p>
<p>並悉該兩業以上列辦法，關係整個金融事業，已於昨日分別通告所屬各會員行莊，於通告日起，自應一律遵守照辦。</p>
<h3>金證券市況</h3>
<p>金證券市場昨日照常開做，到期券無市，第五期價格如左：</p>
<p>開盤八四○萬元，最高八八○萬元，最低八四○萬元，收盤八八○萬元，成交額七六五兩。</p>

<h3>靜坐療病的實驗</h3>
<p>淩正獨</p>
<p>今日青年，因受外界引誘，多數患有手淫等惡習，致身心虛怯，神經衰弱，甚而發育不全，遺精早泄，患此病者，十九處於萎靡不振悲喜失常之境，遠論朝氣蓬勃奮發有爲矣。故小而言之，犧牲一生之幸福，大而言之，實影　於民族之健康。</p>
<p>僕於童年時即犯此病，因身心障礙而感受之痛苦，筆墨難宣。待至二十歲後，會將職業所入，傾力於“荷爾蒙製劑”之注射，三年之中，凡東西各國名藥，均皆嘗試，冀其皼舞內分泌機能，恢複健康，結果除身心較爲愉快外，別無所獲。且注射間斷，神經衰弱病象（如腰酸腦脹耳鳴乏力等）依然如是，故知荷爾蒙劑不過治標而已。他如冷水浴等攝身法，亦不過防患作用，不可恃之爲治本之方。</p>
<p>練習靜坐僅八十天，即氣通三關，面色已由虛黃變爲平實，偶遇感冒喉脹等症，只須一次入坐即　，　風邪已因入坐時，爲正氣驅散矣。至前之腰酸耳鳴等症，早於不知不覺中解除。且入坐時身心舒暢，內分泌腺，呈活躍狀，有熱力，坐複精神充沛，應事接物，興趣盎然，藍氣血不虧，百病自除，故靜坐法之養生，不特患青年病者，得慶更生，實亦普天下人士，可用以延年卻病之天然“荷爾蒙”也。故披露之，以告我青年之同病者，可返求諸身心，不必求於藥物矣。</p>

<h3>His Imperial Highness Prince Nashimoto Bestows Imperial Order on Veterans' Association</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – His Imperial Highness Prince Nashimoto Moriosa, upon assuming the position of President of the Imperial Reservists Association, summoned General Ikutaro Inoue, President of the Veterans' Association, on the 11th, and bestowed a special Imperial Order, instructing that in the face of this unprecedented crisis, they should renew their fervor and devote all their efforts to winning the war. President Inoue was fearful and grateful, respectfully accepting the Imperial Order, and made replies, also reporting on the current state of the association. At the same time, he instructed all members regarding their awareness of the current situation. The original text of the Imperial Order is as follows:</p>
<p>Nashimoto Moriosa, President of the Imperial Reservists Association, hereby informs all fellow veterans upon assuming this position. Looking back since the founding of this association, its affairs have expanded daily, advancing towards the fulfillment of its mission. Members have also each carried out their duties, enduring hardship and lack, striving to contribute to military strength. I am deeply pleased. Now, the Empire has reached a critical juncture, facing enemies on both sides, a major battle that truly determines its safety, prosperity, and decline. However, relying on material strength, disregarding divine power, abandoning righteousness, and merely indulging in brutality will not lead to ultimate victory. History has clearly proven this. To completely destroy formidable enemies on both sides, to support the eternal imperial destiny, I, Moriosa, observe the progress and changes of the war with deep emotion. Therefore, members who join the formations of troops and participate in direct combat should continuously train, further developing their military capabilities, and manifesting the righteous spirit of their ancestors' "loyalty and valor." Those who join the formations of troops should usually cultivate an increasingly elevated military spirit, actively increase the production of military supplies and food, and always stand at the forefront of the spirit of the community. Each should devote all their efforts to winning the war, to repay the gracious imperial favor above and to meet the trust of the great nation below, in order to complete the purpose of the holy war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Tōgō Visits the Palace Again for an Audience</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Tōgō visited the Imperial Palace at 2:10 PM on the 13th to present matters under his jurisdiction to His Majesty the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Research on Atomic Bombs from a Scientific Perspective</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the American use of atomic bombs, the Yomiuri Shimbun published an article on the 13th entitled "Astronomical Explosive Power, a Tyrant Leading to the Extinction of Humanity." The gist of the article is that the new bomb possesses epoch-making power, and its inhuman act is far more intense than poison gas. The United States' use of this new weapon became known to the world after Japan lodged a protest with the United States. According to President Truman's broadcast on the 9th, this new type of bomb is the "atomic bomb" that the United States boasts of. Based on this, the cosmic rays that once caused a sensation in the world of science, i.e., the experiment of atomic nucleus destruction, have now become a weapon of slaughter in the history of mankind and have appeared in this great war. What exactly is an atomic bomb? Here is a quote from a certain doctor, an authority on atomic science: "An atom is the initial stage of the constitution of matter. Around the central nucleus, protons and neutrons rotate at amazing speeds. On the one hand, they are closely combined with each other, but ultraviolet rays and similar elements such as uranium, etc., separate neutrons from the nucleus in a natural state and fly into the air, changing into other substances over many years. This is what is called a radioactive element. When it comes into contact with a radium ingot that has radioactive properties, it can cause great harm. This is a recognized fact. By using a so-called magnetic resonance accelerator, this atomic nucleus can be artificially destroyed. The above method can accelerate the movement of neutrons and generate extremely high heat. Furthermore, if these neutrons are made to collide with the nuclei of atoms such as uranium, the nuclei can undergo a major change in an instant. Based on this principle, when the nucleus is artificially destroyed, the force emitted in all directions is so great that it cannot be calculated. The atomic bomb is manufactured by using this huge force. If the destructive power of uranium atoms is utilized, astronomical explosive power can be obtained, which is tens of millions or even a hundred million times greater than the explosive power of ordinary gunpowder or kerosene lamps."</p>
<h3>Eight Hundred Carrier-Based Aircraft Attack Various Parts of Kantō; Over Forty Aircraft Confirmed Shot Down or Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to Japanese military sources, regarding the results of the enemy carrier-based aircraft that attacked the Kantō region on the 13th, investigations are currently underway. However, according to an announcement by the Eastern Army District Command, as of 11:00 AM this morning, eight aircraft have been shot down and sixteen have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Enemy mobile unit carrier-based aircraft persistently attacked various areas of the Kantō region from a little after 5:00 AM to 5:30 PM, blindly bombing urban areas in Fukushima, Niigata, and other locations, causing some damage to the Japanese side. The Japanese air defense forces launched a courageous attack against them. By 6:00 PM, the confirmed results were seventeen enemy aircraft shot down (including one PByS type) and over twenty-five destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Groups of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Kantō region, the southern part of the Tōhoku region, and the northern part of the Kantō region from 5:00 AM on the 13th, mainly targeting airfields and military facilities. As of 10:00 AM, the cumulative number of enemy aircraft was approximately eight hundred.</p>
<p>Eight Aircraft Shot Down in Various Parts of Kyushu</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – An allied combat bomber formation of approximately 230 aircraft, composed of approximately seventy B25 type aircraft, approximately twenty B38 type aircraft, approximately one hundred and forty small aircraft such as P51 and P47 types, and five airships from the Okinawa base, began invading various parts of Kyushu from 11:30 AM on the 12th. Furthermore, another allied combat bomber formation of over eighty aircraft dispersed from 1:00 PM, strafing transportation facilities, some urban areas, and ships, etc., with machine guns. As of noon, the confirmed Japanese achievements were eight enemy aircraft shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – At approximately 11:30 AM on the 12th, thirty-two P49 type aircraft attacked the northern part of Ryō province from the southeastern end of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The War and the Issue of Humanity</h3>
<p>Internationally, there are regulations regarding the prevention of inhumane acts in the conduct of war and in the means of warfare. However, since the First World War, the belligerent countries have still occasionally violated humanitarian methods of operation and used inhumane combat tools. We cannot but express regret and protest against belligerent countries today that use weapons that are known to cause massive casualties to innocent lives.</p>
<p>In this war, in addition to our occasional hearing of belligerent countries using poison gas, resulting in non-combatants, and innocent civilians being affected by the massive bombing, although there have been new weapons used in various aspects, generally speaking, the use of poison gas has not yet been proven, and the latter actually has inevitable effects. In terms of the effectiveness of ordinary bombing, although the scope and extent of the harm cannot be said to be cruel, there is still a certain limit, and both sides of non-combatants also have evacuation and concealment methods, and sometimes, in order to end the war as soon as possible, in order to obtain lasting peace, large-scale terroristic, nervous-type bombing, may have significant value in strategic and political terms, but in fact any terroristic bombing can not have a decisive role in the war, many facts have been proved.</p>
<p>Now the enemy American side is using a new weapon called the atomic bomb in the war against the allied Japan. This weapon was used in the air raid on Hiroshima, resulting in huge losses to Hiroshima. Regardless of the status and value of Hiroshima, it must have been from this action, the use of this weapon, but according to the information we can get, Hiroshima is a peaceful small city, and as a result, all the dead and injured are innocent peaceful people, so, may I ask the American military using this atomic bomb with amazing and huge destructive power to turn the entire city into ruins, what exactly is the intention? The results of which are contrary to justice and humanity, how will the Americans justify themselves to the world in the future?</p>
<p>However, according to reports, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, commander-in-chief of the US military in China, actually announced to reporters on the 9th of this month that atomic bombs may attack Shanghai. We are even more puzzled as to whether this declaration is intended to intimidate the Japanese army in China or to demonstrate to millions of Chinese people in Shanghai? In fact, the killing and destructive power of atomic bombs cannot choose between people and soldiers, so the intention of this declaration can only arouse the indignation of millions of Chinese people in Shanghai! What the peace zone government led the people to resist was only the invading army of British and American imperialism, and the US commander-in-chief in China actually openly issued threats to the Chinese civilians. We can understand here who is fighting for humanity!</p>
<p>Regarding the inhumane actions of the atomic bomb, Japan has made an official protest to the United States, and many British people have also expressed dissatisfaction with this matter. On the 9th, the London Chronicle published a reader's request to quickly execute the scientist who flattered the demons who slaughtered mankind. We know that all protests may not be effective, but we hope that public opinion in all countries of the world will rise up and oppose this inhumane bombing.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks the Mobile Fleet in the Nearby Seas, While Simultaneously Strengthening Its Interception Posture Day by Day</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American mobile fleet sallied forth in the waters east of Kantō on the 13th, launching an air raid on the Kantō region from the morning. In response, the Japanese Air Force launched repeated attacks starting that afternoon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American mobile fleet, which had temporarily retreated from the Japanese coastline from the end of July to the beginning of August, has attacked again, attacking the Tōhoku region with approximately 1,700 carrier-based aircraft on the 9th, and again attacking the Kantō and Tōhoku regions with approximately 1,600 aircraft on the 10th. On the 13th, it stubbornly launched operations in the Kantō region from morning to evening. The current location of the enemy mobile fleet is in the waters east of Inubōsaki, and it can be estimated that its strength is approximately three groups. As of 10:00 AM, the number of attacking aircraft reached approximately eight hundred. However, recently the enemy has been gradually moving forces from the Leyte area, and it appears that the gathering of approximately four ships by the beginning of this month has been completed. At the same time, observing the actions of enemy submarines along the Japanese coast, etc., the enemy's attempt to invade the mainland is becoming extremely blatant. The Japanese military is seriously monitoring the enemy's actions, and at the same time, the posture of intercepting the enemy is also strengthening day by day.</p>
<p>Eight American Battleships Sunk</p>
<p>Forward Base, 13th (Central News Agency) – In early March of this year, the Japanese submarine unit destroyed an enemy battleship in the central Pacific region. Subsequently, it was confirmed that the battleship had been sunk.</p>
<p>Forward Base, 13th (Central News Agency) – From late July to early August, the Japanese submarine unit sank or destroyed three enemy transport ships and one destroyer in the waters southeast of Okinawa.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the US Army Department announced on the 11th that the US submarines USS Bushy and USS Callaghan have been lost. The USS Bushy had not returned to port last year and was considered lost. The USS Callaghan was sunk in the Okinawa area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – A Washington dispatch said that the US Navy Department announced on the 11th that the escort destroyer USS Underhill, 1,400 tons, sank off the coast of the Philippines, and all 112 crew members died in battle.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Haimen, Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhi</p>
<p>Haimen—this sandy land formed by the alluvial deposits of the Yangtze River and the sea—has only officially appeared on the map of China for a little over 180 years. In these hundred-plus years, immigrants have successively moved here from Chongming, Nantong, and other places. Through their long-term, arduous, and diligent efforts, they have transformed it into today's fertile land. It is located in the southeasternmost part of northern Jiangsu, bordering the Yangtze River to the south, the Yellow Sea to the east, Nantong to the north, and Qidong and Chongming Island to the southeast. Today, Haimen is one of the "cleansed countryside" districts in northern Jiangsu, with eight autonomous administrative regions, 147,309 households, and a total population of 653,924.</p>
<p>Security and Livelihood</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the current security situation in Haimen has significantly improved compared to before the "cleansing of the countryside." Previously, the county government could only enforce its orders in five administrative regions. Needless to say, the remaining three regions were guerrilla areas where the New Fourth Army entrenched itself. After the "cleansing," all of them have now been restored to peaceful villages. Measures such as Baojia census, self-defense training, blockade management, and tax adjustments have been implemented for nearly two years. At the same time, the armed forces responsible for the county's security include several hundred security guards, several hundred armed police, and over a thousand friendly army garrison troops, stationed in important market towns in various districts and townships. However, the New Fourth Army, which has always been a destroyer of peace and construction, is still active in remote areas, like embers flaring up again.</p>
<p>The people bear a heavy burden and are subject to numerous taxes, with various names. Land tax is collected in kind, with five catties of cotton and eight catties of Yuan wheat per mu. This is currently valued at around 3,000 yuan. Of course, national and provincial taxes are also levied, as is the case everywhere. In addition, there are so-called special levies, such as military and police supplies, Baojia fees, self-defense corps fees, expenses for district, township, and town offices, and even entertainment expenses for officials at all levels, which are cleverly disguised and passed on to the common people. Moreover, the New Fourth Army's "public grain" is prevalent, collected even more fiercely than government taxes.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products and Native Cloth</p>
<p>Haimen's main products are cotton and miscellaneous grains, with cotton being the most abundant, comparable to the famous cotton-producing area of Nantong. In its heyday, there were over 110 large and small cotton firms engaged in the collection and distribution of cotton. In the past year or two, as miscellaneous grains have become scarce commodities, production has been declining. The main miscellaneous grains produced are Yuan wheat, corn, and soybeans, which are the staple foods for most residents. Other grains, such as wheat, sorghum, millet, broad beans, peanuts, etc., are secondary. Rice cultivation is almost nonexistent. In the past, these miscellaneous grains were barely enough to supply the local population, and middle- and upper-class families mostly relied on imported white rice as their staple food. In recent years, due to poor transportation and difficulty in obtaining imported food, the cultivation of miscellaneous grains has greatly increased. It is now not only self-sufficient but also has a surplus to supply to Shanghai. In addition, due to the widespread production of cotton, there are many small-scale, semi-manual cotton spinning businesses. Furthermore, with the limited import of foreign cotton fabrics in recent years, the local native cloth has become a major export product. Recently, there has been the so-called improved native cloth, which is a very progressive product. Its appearance is similar to the "Freedom Woolen" produced by the Sanyou Industrial Company in Shanghai in the past, with several colors and yarn thicknesses. It is both elegant and economical, with a market price of 400 to 500 yuan per foot, and is very popular locally.</p>
<p>Drastic Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>Although Haimen can be described as a place of abundant products, general prices are also subject to the ups and downs of the Shanghai market, fluctuating drastically. Several major items, such as wheat, rice, firewood, oil, fish, meat, vegetables, and various foreign daily necessities, are all soaring in price. The most basic living expenses for an ordinary individual are at least around 40,000 yuan per month. This only refers to personal food, haircuts, and laundry, excluding clothing and rent. Although this area has not been affected by the evacuation from Shanghai, with few people returning to their hometowns, it is not easy to rent a decent house in the county or city. Even if you are lucky enough to find one, the rent is shockingly expensive. In terms of actual value, it is at least one dou of rice per room. Currently, the rent is 15,000 yuan per month, and the landlord still says, "What is such a small amount of rent? If I lent out the capital cost of the house, at a rate of two jiao per yuan, 500,000 to 600,000 yuan would yield nearly 100,000 yuan in interest per month!" (Note: "Two jiao per yuan" refers to earning two jiao of interest per yuan per month.) Living in Haimen is indeed not easy!</p>
<p>Culture and Education</p>
<p>Regarding culture here: the entire county has 120 to 130 county-run and private primary and secondary schools, with approximately 20,000 students enrolled. In the county seat alone, there are four middle schools and five primary schools, each with 300 to 500 students. In terms of content, private schools are superior to county schools. Among them, the private Xilei Primary and Secondary School has the best buildings and equipment, while Nengren Middle School and Haixia Middle School are considered the best in terms of academic performance. Private schools collect tuition and fees in the form of Yuan wheat, and the amount is expensive. Middle school students must pay one dan to one and a half dan, and primary school students three dou to six dou. Therefore, private school income is sufficient to be self-sufficient and have a surplus. On average, middle school teachers can earn 2.1 to 3.5 dan per month, and primary school teachers 1.1 to 2.1 (currently, the price of wheat is 45,000 yuan per dan). This salary is higher than that of county school teachers and general lower- and middle-ranking civil servants, who earn only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per month and are struggling to survive. They can look down upon their peers.</p>
<p>The county seat also has a public education center, with monthly expenses of over 70,000 yuan. The center employs five people, each earning only 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per month. It has five or six types of daily newspapers and a book circulation department with nearly a thousand books, which is very meager. That's all. There are several bookstores in the county seat, but strangely, they don't sell books, only stationery and paper. The only source of fresh spiritual nourishment is a Zhao-surname newspaper vendor who shouts through the streets. He has all the daily newspapers from Shanghai and delivers them to subscribers on a regular basis, collecting payment at the end of the month. Among them, *Shen Bao* and *Xin Zhongguo Bao* have the most readers here. He also sells magazines and new books, such as *Ten Years of Marriage*, *Legend*, *One Gentleman's Draft*, *China Inside Story*, etc., and magazines such as *Chunqiu*, *Shen Bao Monthly*, *The Masses*, *Heaven and Earth*, etc., which sell well. Unfortunately, the prices are too high. Daily newspapers sell for nearly 3,000 yuan per month, and new books and magazines are sold at double or triple the price. (Move to support education)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Ministry Announced Yesterday: Prince Yi Wu Promoted, Sergeant Ozawa and Others Awarded Citations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, in commemoration of the merits of Lieutenant Colonel Prince Yi Wu, who was wounded during an enemy air raid on Hiroshima during an operational mission on the 6th and died in battle on the 7th, has posthumously promoted him and awarded him for his merits. The Bureau of Decorations and the Ministry of the Army announced the following on the 13th (Ministry of the Army announced on the 13th): Lieutenant Colonel Prince Yi Wu promoted to Colonel; Colonel Da-Kun'i Prince Yi Wu, awarded 3rd Class Merit, awarded Golden Kite Medal, and bestowed a set of wooden cups.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 13th that on January 9, Showa 20 (1945), near Mengaldar on Luzon Island, Sergeant Ozawa and four others, who repeatedly crushed enemy attacks and boldly stormed and raided enemy bomber landing sites, achieving great results, were awarded citations by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, Commander-in-Chief of the Philippine Islands Area Army, and now have been reported to His Majesty the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Italy Faces Food Shortages, Situation Quite Serious, General Election Scheduled for November</h3>
<p>Berne, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Paris dispatches: The Italian interim head of state, Nenni, who is currently in France assisting in promoting the French Socialist Party's gatherings, officially declared a few days ago: "The Italian National Assembly, which will begin general elections this November, will now resolve to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. At present, we firmly believe that the left-wing parties will be able to obtain an absolute majority in the National Assembly."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from a special correspondent for the *New York Times*: Anyone who visits Italy again in five months will be greatly surprised, because the critical moment for Italy, which declared a truce two years ago, is approaching. Currently, the citizens of Rome place great hope in the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers in London. At the same time, they also deeply hope that the United Nations will sign a peace treaty with Italy that does not involve long-standing territorial disputes, colonial issues, reparations, and military restructuring, which are difficult to resolve in the short term. Instead, the treaty should immediately discuss the serious situation of the entire Italy. The upcoming winter increasingly threatens the survival of most Italian citizens. Food shortages, coal shortages, poor transportation, and rising unemployment are the biggest and most difficult problems facing the Italian people today. At the same time, there are widespread rumors in Italy that the United Nations forces stationed in Italy will soon withdraw, and the general election of the National Assembly is about to be held, causing widespread anxiety. The chaotic situation in northern Italy is especially severe.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Holds Commemoration Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang of China held its 262nd weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the main hall of the headquarters at 10:00 AM today. Members of the Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee, all working comrades of the Central Headquarters, and Kuomintang members from government agencies, totaling approximately 600 people, attended. Deputy Minister Wu Lanxi presided over the meeting. After performing the ceremonial rites, Committee Member Zhou Huarong gave a report entitled "The Communist Question After the Changes in the War Situation," providing a detailed explanation. After the report, the executive and supervisory committee members of the Jinpu Railway Special Party Department held a swearing-in ceremony. Central Government specially appointed Organization Department Deputy Minister Wu Guanxi to supervise the oath and give instructions. The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Rivalry, Roots of Trouble Lie Hidden</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Abend, the New York Times' correspondent in China, once said that even if a part of China, whatever its name, were to be controlled by the Soviet Union, the impact on Asia would be extremely profound, and therefore the danger of the "red" tide would increase. This concern of the United States has now become a reality. On August 9th, the Soviet Union finally dropped its mask and suddenly declared its participation in the war against Japan. The Soviet army has broken through the Manchurian-Soviet border. Regardless of its name, the Soviet Union's participation in the war has given a strong impetus, with different meanings, to both sides of the anti-Japanese resistance. From now on, the Soviet Union will be free to arbitrarily interfere in China's political and military affairs. This phenomenon is indeed one of the United States' greatest concerns. At the same time, the Chongqing side, backed by the United States and expecting to resolve the Communist question, is quite distressed by the sudden expansion of Yan'an's voice due to the Soviet Union's participation in the war. In postwar Europe, the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union has become increasingly acute, and this situation has now reappeared in China. At this critical political juncture, the Soviet Union's declaration of war has caused unprecedented changes in the power of the United States and the Soviet Union in China. Marshal Stalin firmly believes that even if the Soviet Union turns to socialism in one country, the Chinese revolution is essentially linked to the Soviet Union, and he has also incited Yan'an to adopt cunning tactics of fighting against imperialism and opposing wars of aggression. This is nothing but a disguise for the so-called unified Chinese anti-Japanese front, inciting China to war with Japan. This policy has not changed at all even today, so in the future, it will inevitably conflict with the United States' policy toward China, that is, the imperialist capitalist aggression forces. The Yan'an regime deeply understands the Soviet Union's movements and the objective conditions and interests of the international political situation and the so-called world war situation. Therefore, on the one hand, it emphasizes cooperation with Chongqing, and on the other hand, it attempts to extend its power to Chongqing. In fact, Yan'an and the Soviet Union are linked in terms of political ideology, and the linkage in terms of military affairs is also imminent. And the day this is realized will be the day the United States' policy toward China collapses, so this issue will be the core of the Third World War.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor Monnat Enumerates Pétain's Crimes, Strongly Advocates Death Sentence According to Law</h3>
<p>Berne, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Paris dispatches: Marshal Pétain, the former head of the Vichy government, was requested by Prosecutor Monnat on Saturday to be sentenced to death, and his defense lawyers have decided to vigorously defend Pétain's life. Monnat insisted on announcing to the public, roughly stating, "The only punishment for national traitors is the death penalty, and the laws of France cannot be changed because of the age of the criminal. The signing of the armistice agreement caused France to fall into shame, destroyed the country's prestige, endured defeat, and was enslaved by the (German) enemy. Moreover, the attack on Britain was disloyal and unjust, assisting the Axis powers in sinking their own ships, and there was no sense of shame or righteousness, but instead French officers and personnel wore German military uniforms. With these charges, I really do not know if there is any further room for forgiveness or reduction of punishment. Now that our court is a place for applying the law, we must punish all criminals according to law."</p>
<h3>Britain and Denmark Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Copenhagen dispatches: The British and Danish trade agreement, which had been negotiated for ten days, has been concluded, and an agreement on material exchange and financial measures has been signed by both parties.</p>

<h3>The Future Path of Chinese Education</h3>
<p>— Li Tuorong</p>
<p>National strength hinges on education. To understand the success or failure of education, one must observe the dynamic environment. Only then can education flourish. Since the founding of the Republic of China, internal and external troubles have plagued us, with no peaceful days. Politics is not on track, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, how can education not be affected! Our current education is a continuation of the May Fourth Movement. Although there has been no significant progress, it is still better than the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China era. However, looking back and forward, a systematic review reveals that a major revolution in Chinese education is necessary to cultivate talents who can adapt to social conditions. Appointing the virtuous and capable is the only way to eradicate deeply ingrained habits. Strengthening the nation and striving for good governance is the only way to cure student anemia. Today's entire education system cannot influence the situation, but is instead being swept into the vortex of trends. If improvements are not urgently sought, national culture will collapse, and the next generation of citizens will lose their national identity. A Western philosopher said, "A school is a small country. One who can govern a school can also govern a country." How can a country prosper if its schools are not good?</p>
<p>The Importance of Education</p>
<p>Strengthen educational institutions and establish a central ideology: I heard Mencius say, "To be well-fed, warmly clothed, and without education is to be close to beasts." It is evident that without education, one cannot be human, and without education, a nation cannot be maintained. In the past, Charlemagne united the Romans into the Holy Roman Empire through education. General Moltke attributed Prussia's victory over France to elementary school teachers. The Duke of Wellington credited the students' baseball game at Eton College for the victory at Waterloo. Japan's victory over Russia was praised by Ito Hirobumi for Japanese elementary schools, and the success of the Russian Revolution was attributed to "books being more powerful than bombs." Strengthening educational institutions is the foundation for a nation's enduring strength, which is evident to all.</p>
<p>Strengthen Educational Institutions</p>
<p>Since education is like a sharp weapon, all major powers control education. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Therefore, educational institutions cannot be independent because they are used by the government. Consequently, they sometimes lose their educational function. If education were independent and ideas followed the right path, scholars could emerge to save the country in times of crisis. Consider Fang Xiaoru, who refused to draft the enthronement edict for the Prince of Yan, and was not afraid even when his ten clans were exterminated. Wen Tianxiang, with great generosity, wrote, "What have I learned from reading the books of sages?" as he embraced justice. When the Pope violated the law and acted dictatorially, Luther was able to lead the Reformation. When Americans faced bankruptcy, Lincoln emerged to emancipate slaves. When the East India Company oppressed Indians, Burke spoke out for them. This, from the perspective of individual freedom of thought, possesses the power of "an army can be deprived of its commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will." Even from an international perspective, ancient Greece and Rome had freedom in education. Later, even though their national power was lost, their education continued to be passed down. Compared to today's European educators under the iron heel of the government, who disappear without a trace along with their countries, the difference is like heaven and earth! Our country's education has always advocated "excel in learning and then serve." If one succeeds, one advances to serve the ruler and benefit the people. If one fails, one retreats to become a teacher of the people, dedicating one's life to politics and education. If bureaucrats and politicians can arbitrarily occupy educational institutions, and heretical ideas can be introduced into classrooms at any time, and local bullies and gangsters can interfere with educational authority, then education cannot be independent, and scholars cannot be the pillars of society. It will inevitably shift with politics. Since any political system has more darkness than light, how can education seek progress? Therefore, I say that if Chinese education wants to advance in the future, it must strengthen educational institutions and implement independence. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Cultivate National Consciousness</p>
<p>National language (vernacular Chinese) is an essential element for uniting the nation. Our government should issue an order to promote it, hoping to eliminate regional dialects in the future. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education should formulate and issue a national language standard for the entire country to follow. Otherwise, modern vernacular Chinese writing will lack grammatical rules, how can it create beautiful language? However, vernacular Chinese changes constantly. The vernacular Chinese of fifty years ago is different from today's. People two hundred years from now may read today's vernacular Chinese as if it were a foreign language. Just as Chaucer and Shakespeare's English is not understood by modern people and is seen as no different from French, any national dialect can change and cannot preserve the national essence to be passed down forever. Therefore, another unchanging language is needed, such as Latin or Greek. Our classical Chinese has already been changed to be more accessible. Major newspapers across the country use this modern classical style. Wherever Chinese people are located, they can understand it at a glance, and it can be passed down forever unchanged. It is truly sufficient to preserve the national essence. All historical records, biographies, memorial inscriptions, eulogies, and all texts to be passed down to future generations should use modern classical style. I believe that all textbooks in junior high schools and below should use vernacular language, while senior high schools and universities must exclusively use modern classical style. Only in this way can one read and speak ancient texts and cultivate national consciousness. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Popularize Children's Education</p>
<p>Our country has always emphasized a patriarchal society and ancestor worship. People only have the concept of family and not of the nation. Apart from the golden age of the Three Dynasties, there has been little benevolent governance. People regard officials as tigers and wolves. How can they love the country? Unless a government of public opinion is organized, the people are protected, and civic training is provided to fulfill national duties, how can the nation be preserved? Today, marriage is failing in major powers. Our family organization is the best. Cultivating oneself, managing one's family, and governing the country is our excellent motto. Divorce and concubinage must be eliminated. Family education must be developed. The education of children under the age of six can affect their lifelong character. There has never been a case where family education is not good and schools can achieve excellence. National education and patriotic movements should start with children. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Shortcomings of the Current Education System</p>
<p>Improve the current education system and create practical education: Dewey said, "Education is human life. Life grows and changes with circumstances. Those who adapt to the environment survive, while those who go against nature are eliminated." Therefore, the purpose, system, facilities, and policies of education cannot be fixed. They vary with the culture and economy of the region. Western education systems may not be suitable for our country. Urban education may not be applicable to rural areas. Liberal education, when applied to children without habits of discipline, is simply harmful. Utilitarian education, when implemented among immoral people, is no different from giving wings to tigers and leopards. Hedonistic education, when added to impoverished countries, accelerates their bankruptcy. Materialistic education, when placed in the hands of atheists, runs rampant. Communist education, when applied to lazy youth, fosters their indulgence.</p>
<p>Improve the Current Education System</p>
<p>Teachers are no different from doctors. They must seize the opportunity and prescribe the right medicine according to the symptoms. Otherwise, education is omnipotent—sufficient to build a nation, but also sufficient to destroy it. Our country's education system and materials are all copied. Many of them are not what is needed, and what is used is not what is learned, which is incompatible with society. In the future, it is advisable to investigate local needs and formulate practical courses, compiling educational regulations according to the country's situation. For example, if a university wants to investigate commercial education, it should implement the following measures:　Investigate how many shops there are in this area.　How many people are needed in each shop.　How to prepare for the work.　How many people are replaced each year. All information should be collected and reported. Then the university should establish a business school to ensure that talents and social needs are aligned. This is the general idea of reforming the education system. The original intention of education is to modify people's shortcomings, making the foolish wise, the weak strong, the evil tamed, the turbid purified, the greedy honest, the timid brave, and the lazy motivated.</p>
<p>Regarding Teacher Training</p>
<p>Teachers do not know the psychology of young people. They do not conduct "scientific tests" for investigation, but rely solely on speculation and experience, often unaware of the actual situation. In the future, party teachers must have specialized knowledge and special training. How to select teaching materials, how to increase or decrease courses, how to legally equip facilities, how to arrange the school scenery, how to fairly evaluate performance, how to appropriately employ people, how to foster student fellowship, how to improve academics, and how to reform malpractices. All educational affairs should not be carried out rashly without "measurement" and empirical evidence. Only in this way can we eliminate the accumulated habits of corruption and initiate a new educational spirit. If we run schools in this way, what learning will not flourish? If we teach people in this way, who will not be transformed? A new education movement that does not start from the needs of the people and the supply of schools will be difficult to achieve. In short, in a narrow sense, anyone can run a school. In a broad sense, only a dedicated person with specialized training, both talent and virtue, is qualified.</p>
<p>Poverty is the biggest problem in our country today. There are many reasons for poverty, but the first reason is that politics is not on track and production is not guaranteed. For example, overseas Chinese who operate businesses abroad and return with full loads often go bankrupt investing domestically. Without knowledge, how can one manufacture? Therefore, "ignorance" is also a cause of poverty. Compulsory education and eliminating illiteracy can remove "ignorance", but promoting education requires money. Therefore, "poverty" is still the culprit. Everyone cherishes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. How can those who are corrupt have no conscience? However, they are forced by "poverty". One person earns money, and ten or twenty people depend on them for food, forcing them to reach the point where "one member of the family becomes a Buddha, and chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." As the saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will propriety and righteousness arise." If a way to eliminate poverty is not found, even if corruption is constantly scolded, it will be of no avail. Moreover, our country's temporary education focuses on teaching principles and ethics, teaching people how to be human, but not teaching people how to support themselves.</p>
<p>Methods of Production Education</p>
<p>The so-called "a scholar who is devoted to the Way but ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not worth discussing with." The so-called path to production is only about promotion and wealth—"There are houses of gold in books, and there are faces of jade in books. All other professions are inferior, only studying is superior"—this kind of education saves people who are corrupt. In the future, do not repeat the same mistakes. I believe that the first step is to eliminate the names of the academic community—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. After the May Fourth Movement, seeing that scholars could not produce, it was changed to farmers, artisans, merchants, and scholars, which is still not satisfactory. Studying is everyone's right, so everyone is in the academic community. Therefore, it is best to change it to farmers, artisans, merchants, and politics, on the one hand to eliminate the bad habit of seeking to be officials, and on the other hand to promote production education. Look at us, from head to toe, the items used in life are all imported. The materials for civil engineering are all produced by foreigners. Even the techniques of a thread and a needle are all foreign products. With such backward production, we are too busy saving ourselves to talk about enriching the country and strengthening the military.</p>
<p>Methods of Production Education</p>
<p>There are many methods of production education, such as establishing more vocational schools—business, fisheries, forestry, agriculture, engineering, animal husbandry, manufacturing, machinery, pharmaceuticals, mining, and so on. It is difficult to list them all. In the past, labor was despised. In the future, it must be corrected. Student labor service teams and the method of rotating spring plowing can wash away the shame of weak scholars. However, temporarily promoting labor plans is not a fundamental solution. I believe that to produce, we must cultivate habits of diligence. From elementary school to university, each year there should be a required labor course, with at least two hours each day, guided by teachers. On the one hand, labor strengthens the bones and muscles to improve physical fitness, and on the other hand, it teaches technology to increase efficiency. This is the first point. Schools should set up a labor introduction department. For those who are hiring odd jobs, they should designate after-school hours and provide introductions on their behalf to enable students to be self-sufficient and reduce the burden on parents and grandparents. This is the second point. School cleaning, washing, building excavation, gardening, and repairs should be done by students as much as possible, without hiring laborers, only using student services, and paying them wages to enable them to be self-reliant. This is the third point. Extra-curricular life courses should be set up to train labor skills. Only those who have been trained should be dispatched. This is the fourth point. The above production education is already practiced in American schools and can be emulated.</p>
<p>Eliminate Illiteracy: Without eliminating illiteracy, there is no education in society, and it is said to be the largest country in the world with a quarter of the population—among 450 million people, almost 400 million are illiterate; in addition, the characters are difficult and daunting, and the writing is abstract, with only a few numbers containing profound meanings, and it is difficult to understand without chewing the words; therefore, although our country's books contain all modern theories, they still rely on Western learning; although the ancients invented various scientific skills, later generations could not continue them, so they gave up on themselves and copied everything; in the future, writing must be simplified, writing must be deductive, language must be common, application must be convenient, copying must be rapid, teaching methods must be modern, and management must be populist, so that people can understand it at a glance, saving time and effort, so that they can do other things.</p>
<p>And we must strictly set a five-year plan to popularize education, and those in charge and those who protect children will be subject to appropriate punishment, because only when all the people of the country are literate can government orders be carried out swiftly.</p>
<p>Raise the Level of Teachers</p>
<p>To advance education, the plan for today is: (1) Constantly raise the level of teachers and strictly train them: According to recent foreign restrictions on teacher training entrance examinations:　Young men and women must have noble character.　They must be physically healthy and have a respectable appearance.　Their attitude must be appropriate and not frivolous.　They must have sufficient talent and be confident that they can fulfill the vocation of a teacher.　Those whose university grades do not reach B are not allowed to enter the College of Education.　Those who graduate in four years are elementary school teachers, those who graduate in five years are middle school teachers, and those who do not have a master's degree or above from famous domestic and foreign schools are not allowed to be university professors. (2) The teaching profession is sacred: Those who obtain the qualifications of the first article are appointed by the government as lifelong teachers, and even those who are suspended should be used as educational administrative civil servants, and the government should pay for their old-age expenses, so that they can be encouraged: (3) Teachers with excellent performance should be rewarded once every fifteen years, praised once every thirty years, and bestowed with the honor of the first rank after fifty years. (4) Teachers not only have the freedom of academic speech, but also the right to manage and discipline in the classroom, and the principal cannot interfere. The above four methods of training teachers will be able to restore the atmosphere of respecting teachers and upholding the Way, and make people dedicate themselves to educational service. Please do not treat these words lightly!</p>
<p>Achieve the Three Principles of the People Education</p>
<p>The purpose of education is not only to cultivate knowledge and ability, but also to pay attention to the "Three Nourishments"—nourishing a strong will and being able to unite knowledge and action; nourishing a love of beauty and eliminating all evil deeds; and nourishing the strength of fire and being able to reason and strive. In terms of life, it can also improve efficiency—how to make a living, how to support a family, how to use natural resources, how to make money and save the country, which is called production education, in order to achieve the purpose of the Three Principles of the People Education. As for "ignorance being the root of all evil," education must be popularized, and "teachers are like fathers," and only when teachers are respected can the Way be revered. The future of our country's education is bright and boundless. People with lofty aspirations, come forth!</p>

<h3>All Businesses and Shops Should Immediately Resume Operations - Economic Bureau Holds a Discussion Meeting with Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau, concerned about the past two days of price chaos and shop closures, which have greatly affected society and people's livelihood, specially convened a discussion meeting with various industry associations at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 13th) in the bureau's conference room. Representatives from over thirty associations attended, including grains, sauces, local goods, pork, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, department stores, restaurants, northern sundries, pastries, egg industry, northern and southern goods, coal briquettes, flour, alcohol, vegetables, cigarettes, matches and candles, dyeing industry, new pharmaceuticals, Chinese and foreign department stores, watches, pawnshops, industrial oils, rubber, hardware, clothing industry, electrical appliance industry, pigments, thread, utensils, and other industries, as well as Mr. Wan, a representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over ten others. Director Liu delivered a speech, ultimately conveying the following instructions for strict compliance by all shops: (1) All businesses and shops should immediately resume operations, focusing on their core operations, and should not close without reason, causing social unrest and affecting people's livelihood. (2) All businesses and shops should not refuse to sell goods without reason, causing problems for the lives of citizens. (3) During this critical economic juncture, all businesses and shops should not arbitrarily raise prices, causing the social economy to head towards bankruptcy. (4) Citizens should share in the hardships of the times and should not purchase goods exceeding their needs. If there is suspicion of hoarding, shops are instructed to request the presentation of citizen identification cards, record the numbers, and report them to the Intelligence Bureau for investigation. All industry leaders expressed their acceptance. Subsequently, reports were given by representatives from three associations, including Chinese and foreign department store businesses (omitted). The discussion concluded at 1:00 PM, and was considered quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Urges</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Yuanlu, a director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Wen Lanting, the chief supervisor, noting that in recent days various businesses have stopped trading and closed their doors in unison, causing a stir in the market, which is of great importance to the people's livelihood, and having already issued a notice from the chamber to all businesses to resume operations, although many have complied, many are still observing, Mr. Yuan and others, in order to actively urge all industries to return to normalcy, convened a meeting of leaders from all industries in the city at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th) to discuss urging all industries to resume trading immediately to ensure people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Notice to All Industries</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued another notice to all businesses to open their doors, the original text of which is as follows: "The Chamber has investigated that due to the impact of the current situation, some businesses in the city have stopped trading. The Chamber has already published a notice in the newspaper requesting that everyone resume operations. In the past two days, many have complied with the resumption of operations, but there are still a few businesses that are taking a wait-and-see attitude, causing the market to not fully recover, which is deeply regrettable. It must be known that the local authorities are absolutely responsible for maintaining local security and social order. The banking and money industries and the stock market, which are related to finance, have all returned to normal operations, and the receipt and disbursement of funds are still smooth and fluid, without any hindrance. All businesses should understand the hardships of the times and resume normal operations in unison to maintain the status quo. We urge everyone who has not opened their doors to comply and not delay any further. It is of utmost importance, and this notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Shimada Discusses the Sino-Soviet Border War - Japanese and Manchukuo Armies Calmly Responding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Information Department held its regular press conference at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 13th). Lieutenant Colonel Shimada of the Army, Press Officer Katsuno, and Captain Matsumoto of the Army attended. Lieutenant Colonel Shimada provided a comprehensive observation of the Sino-Soviet border war. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Unfolds on the Manchukuo-Soviet Border</p>
<p>Currently, the Kwantung Army of Manchukuo is engaged in combat on the eastern, western, and northern fronts. The Soviet army is invading the territory of Manchukuo from the eastern, western, and northern directions. On the western front, the Soviet army is advancing from Ujumqin in Outer Mongolia towards Linxi. In the north, Soviet troops have invaded Manchuria and are advancing along the Qiqihar railway line towards Hailar. Sanhe, north of this area, is also under attack by Soviet troops, who are attempting to converge with the Soviet troops invading Manchuria in Hailar. Fierce battles are unfolding in the surrounding area. A portion of the Soviet army is also attempting to seize Solun. The Soviet troops south of Heihe and a portion of the troops in Qiqike are currently advancing. Regarding the Soviet troops invading Hulin in the east, they are advancing along the Hulin line. In the south of the eastern front, the area east of Suifenhe and a portion of Suifen are extending towards Muling via Suiyang. On the Qingxing and Korean border, battles are occurring near Rason via Unggi. On all fronts, the Kwantung Army, in unity with the officials and people, is launching counterattacks.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Operations Will Make Progress</p>
<p>In addition, a portion of the Soviet Air Force is responding to the ground forces' invasion by launching small-scale air raids or ground attacks on major cities in Manchukuo, such as Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Harbin, Xinjing, and Jilin. As for the strength of the Soviet invasion force, no accurate figures have been reported to date. Judging from the current state of the war, there are no large-scale forces. There may be a portion of mechanized troops invading on the western front, so it is still too early to judge the enemy's intentions. Regarding the terrain of the three fronts, in the eastern front, the battles centered on Suifenhe and Dongning are mostly fought on high ground, and the terrain is dangerous. Therefore, fighting here is difficult for both the enemy and us. Secondly, on the Hulin front north of Lake Khanka, in addition to the Wandashan Mountains, there are mostly wetlands and swamps extending to the opposite bank of Khabarovsk near the Soviet border. The north of the Heihe River basin, along the border area, has few plains. In addition, the Lesser Khingan Mountains are high. On the Hailar front in the north, used as the province, the grassland is a land, that is, the famous Greater Khingan Mountains, extremely the Linxi front, connected to the outer Mongolian mountains, up to the Sino-Manchukuo border. All Kwantung Army fighting on those fronts are well trained in their terrain, and will surely be able to cope with the enemy in the future, and will certainly give them pain. The current Kwantung Army is calmly greeting the enemy coming, and will surely give it a severe blow.</p>
<h3>Drastic Measures Will Be Taken Against Violations of Light Control - Announcement by the Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in order to strictly enforce light control, issued an announcement stating: "In recent days, due to citizens' misinterpretation of the war situation, light control has been neglected, which is regrettable. Seeing that the entire Greater East Asia is still at war, citizens should adapt to wartime conditions and understand the intentions of the authorities, strengthen the civil air defense position, and always be vigilant. Light control must be strictly enforced. Citizens should strictly abide by the implementation, and after 10:00 PM every night, they must still enter the state of light control, absolutely avoiding light leaks. All vendors must use air defense lights when operating before 10:00 PM, and all operations must be stopped after 10:00 PM. All vehicles should also implement vehicle light control to prevent enemy aircraft from invading and protect the safety of Greater Shanghai. The police authorities of the Swiss Army will work with the Baojia self-defense groups to organize light control crackdowns and strictly investigate. The headquarters has also adopted a resolute attitude, taking the same measures as the military and police authorities, and will resolutely adopt a strict joint responsibility system for those who violate light control, cutting off electricity on the spot. It is hoped that citizens will monitor each other, and report those who deliberately violate the regulations to the police station in charge for punishment, to avoid being implicated innocently. Other air defense facilities must also be rectified and must not be damaged in any way. Those who violate the regulations will also be handed over to the military and police authorities for strict punishment according to the law."</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Advises Against Displaying National Flags</h3>
<p>The Police Bureau authorities issued a statement advising against the display of national flags, saying: "Recently, the display of national flags has been observed in various districts of the city. The national flag is a symbol representing the nation, and we should earnestly respect it and not use it lightly, as everyone is well aware. Currently, various rumors are circulating. Citizens should be self-respecting and cautious, maintain a calm and composed attitude, and refrain from displaying national flags."</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Businesses Decide to Continue Accepting and Making Payments as Usual</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association, recognizing the significant impact of banks and money houses on the market and various industries, convened an emergency joint meeting of the silver and money industries the other day. They resolved to adopt the following temporary measures regarding the operations of various banks and money houses:</p>
<p>㈠ Banks and money houses will continue to accept and make payments for customer deposits as usual. (A) Banks and money houses will accept all customer deposits, whether in the form of negotiable instruments or cash. (B) All cash received by banks and money houses may be deposited into the Central Bank of China, the Silver Union, or the Money Treasury at any time, except for a portion set aside as vault cash.</p>
<p>㈡ Banks and money houses should immediately cease lending to customers if the intended use of the loan is abnormal, unnecessary, or could fuel speculation.</p>
<p>It is understood that the association notified all member banks and money houses of the above measures, which are critical to the entire financial industry, yesterday, and they are required to comply with them from the date of the notice.</p>
<h3>Gold and Securities Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The gold and securities market operated as usual yesterday. There was no market for matured bonds. The price of the fifth issue was as follows:</p>
<p>Opening price: 8.4 million yuan; highest: 8.8 million yuan; lowest: 8.4 million yuan; closing price: 8.8 million yuan; transaction volume: 765 taels.</p>

<h3>The Experiment of Curing Illnesses Through Meditation</h3>
<p>Ling Zhengdu</p>
<p>Today's youth, being seduced by the outside world, mostly suffer from bad habits such as masturbation, resulting in physical and mental weakness, neurasthenia, and even incomplete development, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation. Those who suffer from this illness are mostly in a state of depression and emotional instability, let alone being energetic, vigorous, and ambitious. Therefore, on a small scale, they sacrifice the happiness of their lives, and on a large scale, they actually affect the health of the nation.</p>
<p>I suffered from this illness in my childhood, and the pain I felt due to physical and mental impairment is difficult to describe in words. When I reached the age of twenty, I devoted my occupational income to the injection of "hormone preparations." In three years, I tried all the famous medicines from various countries, hoping to stimulate endocrine function and restore health. As a result, I gained nothing except a relatively pleasant physical and mental state. Moreover, when the injections were interrupted, the symptoms of neurasthenia (such as back pain, brain swelling, tinnitus, and fatigue) remained the same. Therefore, I knew that hormone preparations were only a temporary solution. Other methods of physical health, such as cold water baths, are only preventive measures and cannot be relied upon as a fundamental cure.</p>
<p>After practicing meditation for only eighty days, my *qi* flowed through the three *guan*, and my complexion changed from pale yellow to normal. Occasionally, when I encountered symptoms such as a cold or throat swelling, I only needed to meditate once to recover. The evil winds were dispelled by the *zhengqi* during meditation. The previous symptoms of back pain and tinnitus disappeared unconsciously. Moreover, when meditating, the body and mind are comfortable, the endocrine glands are active, and there is heat. After sitting, one feels energetic, and dealing with things and people is full of interest. If the *qi* and blood are not deficient, all diseases will be eliminated. Therefore, the health benefits of meditation not only allow those suffering from youth diseases to celebrate their rebirth but also provide all people in the world with a natural "hormone" that can be used to prolong life and prevent disease. Therefore, I disclose this to tell my fellow sufferers among young people that they can seek within their own bodies and minds, without resorting to drugs.</p>
<h3>Special Court Sentences Three Cases of Public Officials' Malfeasance; Sentences and Fines Imposed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Government Special Court sentenced three cases of police malfeasance, etc., yesterday (the 13th) at 10:00 AM. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Treasury Official Embezzles Public Funds: ㈠ Chang Zhaoxiang, a staff member of the Treasury Section of the Municipal Finance Bureau, was responsible for bookkeeping, auditing, and assisting in the cashier and accounting affairs. In April of this year, due to the high cost of living and low monthly income, he thought that the section chief, Chen , often handed over the section's checkbooks and payment seals for him to hold and use on his behalf. He then conspired with his classmate, Jin Rui, to embezzle public funds, promising Jin Rui one-fifth of the profits. On the 10th of that month, he stamped the receipt for the checkbook from the section's checkbook with the aforementioned seal, and Jin Rui received checkbook No. 207 from the Shanghai Branch of the Ningbo Industrial Bank at 23 Ningbo Road on the 14th. On the 18th, he stamped two blank checks in the checkbook and handed them over to Jin Rui, instructing him to fill out a check for 2 million yuan, dated April 19th. Jin Rui obtained 1 million yuan in cash and 1 million yuan in transfer orders the next day. He handed the cash to an employee of the Juxingcheng Bank, his brother Jin Changxi, in exchange for a transfer order for 1,020,000 yuan. He used another transfer order for 1 million yuan to purchase two gold rings, weighing 7.42 *qian* in total, for 898,000 yuan at the Fang Jiuxia Silver Shop at 479 Nanjing Road. The remaining 100,200 yuan, along with the transfer order, were deposited into Jin Rui's account at the Yumin Bank to earn interest, except for the odd 22,000 yuan. On the 24th, Chang Zhaoxiang again instructed Jin Rui to fill out a check for 3 million yuan and obtain three transfer orders for 1 million yuan each. Taking advantage of the section's opportunity to transfer the received bills to the bank, he drew out a check for 2.4 million yuan from the Fuxing Bank and two transfer orders for 300,000 yuan each. The next day, he obtained a transfer order for 2.4 million yuan from the Fuxing Bank and deposited it into the account of his uncle, Wang Weibao, of the Nanjing Meixin Stationery Store, in the Trust Department of the Guohua Bank, obtaining a receipt, which he sent home to Nanjing by express mail. The two transfer orders for 300,000 yuan each, totaling 600,000 yuan, were handed over to Jin Rui for storage.

<p>Sub-Bureau Police Officers Accepting Bribes</p>
<p>㈡ Cai Zhongkui, a police officer from the Lingjiamu Police Station of the Dongchanglu Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, was assigned to patrol at the Lingjiamu Bridge pier on the morning of May 7th at around 6:00 AM. Seeing pedestrians carrying goods, he would deliberately make things difficult for them, demanding bribes of 200 to 300 yuan before allowing them to pass. Zhang Jinchun and Chen Wu, carrying coal, each paid 200 yuan. After crossing the river, they were again stopped by Huang Keguang, a patrol officer from the Yulin Road Sub-Bureau, at the Andong Road public pier, who used the same method, causing them to pay bribes of 200 yuan and 300 yuan, respectively. The matter was discovered by inspectors from the Police Bureau's Inspection Department. They led Zhang Jinchun and others to identify Cai Zhongkui, and found a total of 3,700 yuan in bribes he had continuously received from pedestrians. He was handed over to the Police Bureau, which forwarded the case to the Mayor to be presented to the National Government, which ordered the court to try the case. Cai Zhongkui was sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment for continuously accepting bribes for official actions, and fined 30,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the total amount of the fine will be converted into forced labor based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to the number of days in six months. Huang Keguang was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months of imprisonment for continuously accepting bribes for official actions, and fined 20,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the total amount of the fine will be converted into forced labor based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to the number of days in six months. The 3,700 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was confiscated, and the 500 yuan in bribes received by Huang Keguang was recovered and confiscated.</p>
<p>Fraudulently Claiming Free Rice Rations for Police Officers</p>
<p>㈢ Shao Tianxing, an employee of the Municipal Police Welfare Society, was responsible for collecting tickets for the distribution of May's police rice rations to officers of the General Bureau on June 4th of this year. Seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and obtain illegal gains, he did not stamp the paid mark on four ration tickets for free police rice that had already been claimed by plainclothes police chiefs Li Shijin and Hu Wenbin (6 *dou* each) from the Special High Section, and Police Sergeant Qi Shouxian (6 *dou*) and Zhong Yupu (2.5 *dou*) from the Fifth Inspection District. The next day, he handed them over to his friend Wu Lianqing, who knew about the matter, who in turn entrusted the Jiang Liandi and Jiang Lingdi sisters at 50 Peideli, Datong Road, to reclaim them. The rice distributor at the society mistakenly believed that they had not yet been claimed and issued 8.5 *dou* of rice to Jiang Lingdi, who held the ration tickets for Li Shijin and Liang Yupu. At that time, there were many people crowding around, and Jiang Liandi had not yet received her rice. Zhang Jingzhi, an employee of the society who knew her, saw that the rice recipients on her rice tickets were Hu Wenbin and Qi Shouxian, and became suspicious. After investigating and discovering that the tickets had already been claimed, she reported the information to the Deputy Manager, who recovered the rice claimed by her sister. The case was sent to the Police Bureau, which forwarded it to the Mayor to be presented to the National Government, which ordered the court to try the case. Shao Tianxing was sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment for using his official position to attempt to unlawfully obtain benefits for himself by using fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their property, and fined 50,000 yuan, with deprivation of public rights for 4 years. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be converted into forced labor at a rate of 1,000 yuan per day. Wu Lianqing was sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment for assisting in the attempt to unlawfully obtain benefits for himself by using fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their property, and fined 30,000 yuan. If he is unable to pay the fine, he will be converted into forced labor at a rate of 1,000 yuan per day.</p>
