<h3 id="c8">投機與游資 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>事變以來，上海乃至整個華中經濟病態的　結，首推游資的作祟，但是回顧歡年來的實際情况，其作惡之猖狂程度，其危害社會經濟以至閣家政策的程度，却再沒有像目前這樣混亂嚴重了。</p>
<p>上海一向是游資集中之地，這是因爲上海是全國經濟中心；內地需要的各種日用品，又大都仰給於上海。事變之初，各地治安不良，資產階級携共資金避地來滬，益增上海游資膨脹的數量。據民國二十一年中國銀行營業報告書所載，集中上海的資金，已約占全國銀貨的半數以上，苦無正當出路，而農村則資金枯竭，產業蕭條。這正是當時政治不上軌道的經濟畸形明證。然而，當時全國銀貨，總數不過二十二億元，上海方面的流動資金，不過六億元而已，其中可指爲游資的，人約只有四億元。其時工商各業，尙有正常發展的機會，所以這些游資，尙未發生惡性作用，而一般有心人士，已大聲疾呼，提出「資金歸農」的口號了。</p>
<p>直到事變前夕，當時上海華商銀行存款，合計約在二十億元左右，其中可稱爲游資的，五六年間一直維持五·六億元之數；但看當時銀行之長期存款保持百分之七十五以上，活期存款僅及百分之二十五以下之比例，即可證明。事變以後，大量資金一度向香港逃避，其後上海秩序漸復，而香港反形不安，資金向滬回流，一時形成畸形弊榮，投機之風亦漸展開，游資問題，因之漸見嚴重。但因當時上海環境在本質上和事變前無大差異，游資雖多，活動的地盤尙大，所以一時未即形成重大的社會問題。迨大東亞戰爭發動，整個客觀環境急速轉變，一部分淸資雖曾轉向內地，而因內地缺乏出路重復流歸上海，同時香港保持的三十億元淤資亦潛回上海。至三十一年底上海游資約達七十四億元之鉅。　資爲害間題遂日趨嚴重。</p>
<p>民國三十一年年底至目前之兩年以來，當局對於游資的活動，雖曾盡力防制，其初如金融統制之實施，投機市塲之取締（包括外幣，外股，公債，烚赤，紗布等等），尤其是紗布收買，造成暫時的市塲安靜。其後一切舉措，如物價對策，證券交易所之復業等，則都未能阻止游資的猖獗，且兩年來流通資金之增加，游資數額達到空前的龐大數字，旣無正當出路，遂羣向投機囤積之途，利用每一次國際局勢的變動，甚至完全利用謠言，進行肆無忌憚的投機。而當局對於這種投機者，不過空言警誡，雖有限制法令，猶如具文，而無嚴刑以隨其後，終於造成今日混亂嚴重的危局。這幾天來市塲之混亂已達極頂。黃金飛漲，自不必說，即以統債而言，三十一年改用中儲券時價格，不足三十元，後以國府承認舊債，乃升至百元；其時北帮以聯銀券搜購套利，亦不過突出百元大關而巳，其後逐步上騰，最近數日間更猛升狂漲，已由千而萬而數萬元！再看華股，舊正以來，至最近數星期而暴漲自數倍至數十倍不等，但前日敵機方臨，午前午後巿勢大異，上午尙有若干種漲至停板，而下午竟慘跌停板！如永安紗廠升至二千七百，突跌至一千八百四十元，美亞綢廠升至二千八百二十元，突跌至一千九百三十元，又其間眞正投資者所受損失如何？市面之被攪亂之影響又如何？從道裏更足暴露投機者的狼心！但是投機者憑什麼攪亂市塲破壞社會經濟呢？無疑的是利用其龐大的游資？</p>
<p>投機的工具旣然是靡大的游資，爲挽救市塲的混亂，爲挽救經濟崩潰的危機，自當從治標的取締投機與治本的導引游資於正軌兩事入手。在未能嚴厲取締投機之前，不易使猖獗的游資就範。所以，首先要澈查擾亂市塲的投機者，我們在三月三十一日社評中，盼望市政當局嚴切注意，對於危害戰時經濟的犯罪行爲，應即查明移送特別法庭予以斷然處置，以遏亂萌。至於導引游資問題，容再申論之。</p>

<h3 id="c9">首都防空工作 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>强化防空</p>
<p>戰時的防空工作，是極重要的問題。京市是首都所在地，格外顯得重要，加以近來空襲頻繁，防空工作愈見迫切，茲將首都防空工作推進情形，分兩點來說：</p>
<p>積極分面，不外乎建築多量的防空壕了。祇因首都地區遼闊，人口衆多，一遇空襲，多數民衆往往張惶無措，一時找不到適當地方趨避，甚至有很多人徬徨街頭，致被流彈破片殺傷。推求其故，實因原有防空壕過於簡陋，且數量過少。去年一度動員全市警防人員，義勇警察，及保甲人員，挖掘防空壕，但充其量不過數千個，每個以容納十人計，最多能容數萬，如果公私機關自建防突襲地下　也同　能容納數萬人，也不敷七十萬市民躱避之用。</p>
<p>過去，市內各商店居民自動挖掘的防空壕，比較稍可人意，建的露公天防空壕，十之八九多已湮塡不能應用。當局雖曾鼓勵市民自動挖掘，但因民衆因於經濟力量，致難實行。</p>
<p>最近當局又有指導市民在空襲時作適當趨避之舉，經於各區擇定空地或公共塲所，作爲市民臨時趨避之地，並且還在計劃加築大防空壕，一面又尅日整理原有防空壕。</p>
<p>消極方面，因鑒於過去浦口和下關地區因空襲而受難者不少，已由京市當局在二月十四日成立了一個「南京地區空襲災害對策委員會，」專責辦理空襲救濟事宜。</p>
<p>救濟辦法，規定兩類：　破壞房屋，最高救濟一萬元，半壞以下的三千元至五千元。　死傷，死者三千元至五千元，重傷一千元至三千元，輕傷五百元至一千元。該會是中日兩方共同組織成的，經費一部由中日地方當局負担，一部由中央補助和募捐而來，救濟對象限於南京地區的中日民衆。</p>
<p>檢定血型</p>
<p>對於防空的救護預防工作，最近當局又決定了新的施策，衛生署為防息未然計，將舉辦檢定血型計劃。該署擬訂的「全國民衆血型檢定計劃大綱」，「衛生署血型檢定委員會組織規程」，「各省市縣血型檢定委員會組織通則」，「血型檢定實施辦法」四個草案，都已經於三月十三日第二四五次行政院會議通過了。</p>
<p>現在血型檢定委員會，已在三月二十五日成立，主委由陸署長兼任，由其他有關各部次長和衛生機關長官十二人任委員。</p>
<p>這個委員會是檢定工作的中央最高建議諮詢機關，用以監督指揮各省市縣的檢定工作。至於需用材料，委員會由中央發給，各省市除衛生署酌撥外，由地方自行籌辦。</p>

<p>彭斯因此乃提出辭職</p>
<p>中央社訊　據外電傳，美國戰時動員局長彭斯辭職，由聯邦融資局長感恩遜繼任一節，據稱，彭斯對羅斯福表示辭意，乃於三月二十四日聯合軍渡過萊因河之日，辭職後幷於二十九日對新聞記者謂：「余因知悉目前余所担任工作之性質，故決意辭職」。彼所謂「目前担任之工作」者，乃指太平洋作戰所需人力與物資之動員計劃而言。</p>
<p>對保戰力已失自信</p>
<p>據吾人觀察，彭斯對於美國保持戰力至「勝利之日」，似已失自信，故有辭職之舉。華盛頓當局始發表於彭斯提出辭表三日之後彼所提議之縮少造艦計劃，幷謂：此項計劃，由於調查進行全般軍事計劃所必需之人的資源數量而決定之。美海軍長官福萊斯特更附和謂，此項計劃，實為彭斯提議，已由常局圓滿接受之表示云云，查該項縮少造艦計劃之內容，原定建造戰鬥用船舶八十四艘（六三六，八六〇噸），改爲建造護送用之航空母艦十二艘（一五一，〇〇〇噸），此項縮少計劃，能否節省建艦工業與人力，雖未能詳知，然彭斯曾由克里米亞會議同至美京時曾對人日，余已製作比較過去可使用更多人員之作戰計劃，意即今後作戰計劃，必需更多人員，殊有困難性也。</p>
<p>動員女工人數大增</p>
<p>再就美國動員女工之人數言，一九四〇年四月計一千一百萬人，至一九四四年四月，則增至一干六百萬人，美國不但有此人的資源之缺乏，更有成爲今次縮少建艦計劃原因之鐵鋼，船舶·食糧等等之缺乏。美國聯合艦隊司令官余格，在過去一年之工作報吿中謂，吾人前進之速度，造成新的生產問題，吾人加速度之作戰行動，必須某種重要物資之大量消耗，此種物資之生產，實有供不應求之概，此項「新生產問題」與「某種物資」之大量消耗，已證明美國太平洋作戰，已經到達殺高潮矣。</p>
<p>物資補給將起恐慌</p>
<p>又美國軍事生產工業中，在一月問超過預定數者，僅子彈一種，其他製造品均比十二月份減少百分之一，其他製造品均比十二月份減少百分之一，其最大原因，爲鐵鋼原料減少，關於艦船亦有同樣情形。國務次官格魯於三月一日在外國新聞協會講演謂「呂宋島及硫黃島作戰，最初六十日間，美國所動員之船舶已達三百八十萬噸」，目前進行中之冲繩作戰及其他地區所需要船舶更多，長此以往，美國軍事物資之補給。幾無限度，將來必有發生物資恐慌之一日。事實上，美國戰力目前已經到達最後限度，由此可知彭斯之決心辭職，實已深知其因，殆無疑問也。</p>
<h3 id="c19">佔老河口機塲後　日軍攻守兩便 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>出淵部長在記者例會談戰局</p>
<p>盟邦日本駐滬陸軍報道部於昨日下午三時循例舉行報　常會，到出淵部長前原中尉及各報記者十餘人，出淵部長發表關於日軍佔據老河口飛機塲之重大意義及沖繩島方面作戰之趨勢等，茲誌大要如次：</p>
<p>大陸戰局</p>
<p>最近日軍突入老河口飛機塲意義甚為重大：　在軍事上一方面可以保衛武漢，一方可以進攻重慶。老河口係北方關隘，乃兵家必爭之點，從此日軍於攻守兩方面，得以自由決定。　自日軍將桂林柳州美空軍根據地摧毀後，老河口則成爲駐渝美空軍前進基地，自去年十二月起，美空軍利用此基地對平漢隴海及揚十江一帶交通，不時予以破壞。自贛州遂川兩機塲遭日軍攻佔後，此一方面之美空軍更見活躍，日軍一舉而摧毀之美空軍，只得退守安康。從此日軍即可取道於此，進攻重慶，一方面則可以固守武漢。　老河口在地勢上言之，西對渝，南對黔，均屬咽喉之要點，故無論由南而北，或由東而西，無異已闢有途徑。又自日軍佔據老河口後，渝第十戰區軍之後路全被切斷，已形成孤立矣。</p>
<p>沖繩戰局</p>
<p>關於太平洋沖繩列島方面之戰局，出淵部長謂，日美雙方均此以全力激戰，日軍已予美軍以極大損失，日軍獲得更人之戰果，美軍方面沉毀之艦船已達一百七十餘艘，美海軍在冲繩島方面作戰，離其本國甚遠，故補給上極感困難也。</p>

<p>健康比賽</p>
<p>準時開會，由主席並報吿主持本届嬰兒健康比賽經過，繼請周市長代表羅秘數長致詞，旋由衛生局醫師桂質良女士演講育嬰常議後，報吿嬰兒健康優勝評判結果：計</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席戴局長致開會詞：「今日爲四四兒童節日，同時舉行本市第四屆嬰兒健康比賽大會給獎典禮，我人深感爲人最爲偉大，而小朋友更爲偉大。因此本局在今日四四兒童節日，特主辦嬰兒健康比賽，實際工作由市立實騐民衆敎育館負資。本會自三月二十日起辦理嬰兒登記事宜，爲便利往返起見，全市分東西南北中五區登記，參加嬰兒以出生日期爲標準，分甲乙丙丁四組比賽，參加人數共三六六人，三月三十一日和四月一日爲檢查嬰兒體格日期：參加者二四四人。本會爲愼重起見，組織評判委員會，負資評定次第，及分配獎品，每組規定錄取前十名，四組共計四十名。查本屆參加的人數比較前幾屆多，成續比較過去好，獎品也比較得多，可見本市民衆對於嬰兒的健康，比過去更加注意，這是値得慶幸的一件事。不過有幾點値得請各位注意的：　這次檢查的結果，孩子長得肥胖的大都是母親親自哺乳的，　母親愛淸潔的，大都孩子也很淸潔。　有些孩子一歲半還在吃奶，這是不對的。　有些孩子兩歲還沒有種牛痘，這也是不對的。　這次參加嬰兒比賽者，男（一七六）多於女（六八），檢查體格也是男勝於女，似乎有重男輕女的心理，這也是不對的。」</p>
<p>秘書長詞</p>
<p>羅秘密長致詞，略謂：「今日爲四四兒童節日，同時又利用今天舉行本市第四屆嬰兒健康比賽大曾，承各位家長　領最喜歡，最心愛的小朋友踴躍參加，本人站在市府立塲，深表感謝。今日本人特提供三點意見，深望各家長注意：</p>
<p>第一，為什麽注意兒童敎育問題及嬰兒育養問題？此點頗具重大意義。査中國古代已及早注意保育，在母胎中已深刻注意，所謂胎敎，舉凡小孩在長大時，尤對敎養問題，更須加以注意。本來敎與學爲二件事，在中國爲父母者，僅祇注重於育字，對敎字上着重頗少，因小核平時衆喜吃食，爲父母者任其所喜，則將來必成爲野孩子，故在國民敎育上對於胎敎上更須注意，否則忽略嬰兒，在將來對社會國家影響至鉅。深望各位爲父母者，在今後注意胎敎，好好敎養兒女，注重兒童敎育，靑年敎育，不但裨益國家社會，則對民族復興上之貢獻，亦匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>其二，一般家長對小孩往往由於太愛，忽略敎育義務，任其胡食，甚致在嬰孩時，只顧本身之喜歡，不顧及嬰兒之不如意。査此項動機，為父母者乃愛護自已子女，其實結果反遭致累害小孩，因此由於爲愛生害，非但無益兒童嬰孩，甚且加害。</p>
<p>其三，値茲時局非常之今日，一般國民生活已深感困離，在父母者對生活尙感不足，因此不顧及小孩，深望全市家長廳竭力避免困難，盡最大努力保護小孩。</p>
<p>最後一點更切注意，即平日所謂長命富貴，其實長命需要，當貴則可不必，因每一小孩之長命，對國家民族前途上有關至鉅，深望父母敎養靑年兒童，應爲國家爲社會切實負責。願望在下次兒童節日，全巿人民均踴躍參與，則嬰兒比賽，有更大之舉行。</p>
<p>贈送恩物</p>
<p>上海兒童圖書館，昨日慶祝兒童節，舉辦讀書報吿競賽，及贈送兒童恩物，自上午九時開始，在總館及分館同時分送，到有董事林康侯，應永玉，黃警頑緖氏，及閱覽兒童達六千人，盛極一時。</p>

<p>東亞海運公司</p>

<p>「新寗紹」「子丸」「興東」等輪之行駛期變動頗大，並不預先公佈，常臨時變更，王純記代理店爲免旅客奔走徒勞起見，故實行事先登記辦法，有船即派人送票，用意至善，每張規定收手續費二百元，但間有不照章收費者。</p>
<p>碼頭船上情形</p>
<p>行李搬運，有公營之上海外灘碼頭行旅服務社，規定大件收費四百元，小件收費二百元，（旅客行李必須交其搬運，小件包裏亦不准携帶搬遝費每件索價五六千元之鉅，亟待設法改善。</p>
<p>輪船啓行後，尙有以舢舨載客，半途攀登者，吊費索五千至一萬元，無票者上船後由茶房私　設法補票。四等客買舖位之巿價約萬元，飲食等費亦頗昂，故旅行此綫必須多帶旅費，以免進退維谷。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Enemy Ships Around Okinawa Continue to be Sunk and Destroyed, Exceeding Ten Vessels; Japanese Army on Land Launches Fierce Counterattack <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th: Though suffering considerable damage near the coast, the enemy landing on Okinawa Island had advanced to the area south of Kitatani Island and Awase by April 3rd. Japanese forces in that area continue to engage the enemy in fierce combat. The damage inflicted on enemy ships around the island, as confirmed so far, is as follows: six transport ships sunk, one battleship sunk, four cruisers sunk, one destroyer damaged, and one ship of unknown type sunk.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – American forces on Okinawa Island are currently attempting to forcibly advance and cut off the island. At noon on the 3rd, an enemy force of approximately 6,000 men with 30 tanks and 20 trucks had reached Teruya (6 kilometers northeast of Kitatani). Furthermore, part of the enemy force is attempting to move south via Momobaru and Awase. Consequently, the Japanese garrison is luring the enemy to launch a counterattack from the south, and fierce battles are now underway. On the other hand, enemy ships around Okinawa Island are currently cruising in the waters west of Kita Airfield, the waters west of Naha, the waters west of Itoman, and south of Minato River. The enemy fleet consists of seven or eight aircraft carriers, four battleships, approximately one hundred other warships, and several hundred transport ships and minesweepers. On the 2nd, these enemy ships bombarded the island in a pacifying manner, while simultaneously using carrier-based aircraft to cover their landing forces. Today, special attack units of the Army and Navy are continuing their fierce attacks on these enemy ships. The results from the morning of the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd are as follows: one battleship bombed and sunk, one cruiser bombed and sunk, two cruisers sunk, one ship of unknown type burned, and one transport ship heavily damaged. In addition, one cruiser was set on fire.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force launched a determined suicide attack on the American mobile task force appearing near Ishigaki Island on the 1st. This was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. The initially announced destruction of one regular aircraft carrier has since been determined to be a sinking. Furthermore, on the 3rd, Japanese air units launched a fierce attack on American warships in the waters off the Ryukyu Islands, and it appears that several cruisers have been sunk.</p>

<p>Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy, who have been sweeping the Baguio area for days, recently advanced along mountain roads, using local bandits familiar with the terrain as vanguards. In that area, two brave Japanese soldiers, Sergeant Ishikawa and Private First Class Amahima, annihilated approximately 50 enemy soldiers with explosives on a road 5 kilometers east of Naguilian. Corporal Inazawa and his team annihilated about 10 enemy soldiers with explosives. The enemy continues to reinforce their forces, using tanks as vanguards. On the afternoon of the 29th, three tanks and 300 infantrymen attacked the Japanese position and shelled the vicinity. At that time, Japanese troops immediately advanced in hand-to-hand combat. By the morning of the 30th alone, Japanese assault troops had killed or wounded 15-16 enemy soldiers and scattered about 100. The enemy, building a road northeast from Aringay, advanced about 20 kilometers from that location on the afternoon of the 30th, reaching Gariabud. They are actively transporting military supplies by truck. The enemy in the Irubuc area in the south is also attempting to gradually invade northeast. Japanese units in the area launched a fierce attack on them on the 29th, annihilating enemy soldiers who had invaded Taroy and the highlands to its west. On the 30th, after a fierce bombing, the enemy attacked again with a force of four companies. Japanese troops immediately responded with accurate fire, inflicting heavy losses.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Fight Bravely on the South Bank of Laguna de Bay</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese right-wing unit’s offensive on the stronghold east of Manila is becoming increasingly fierce. After occupying San Mateo on the night of the 23rd, they further occupied San Isidro, south of Montalban, on the 25th. The assault unit in that area attacked the Marikina ammunition depot around 2:00 PM that afternoon, causing a large explosion. Japanese troops in Los Baños, on the south bank of Laguna de Bay, are fighting bravely against the enemy, who possess eight large cannons. On the 25th and 26th, they killed or wounded 369 enemy soldiers and 73 bandits, destroyed six tanks and one truck, and repelled the enemy. However, the stubborn enemy launched an offensive from Laguna de Bay with landing craft. Japanese troops sank three of them, and the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. At the same time, the Japanese counterattack north of Mount Laksasa, corresponding to the southern front, has become more fierce since the 23rd, completely repelling the enemy along the north-south line and are currently mopping up the remaining enemy. In addition, they are launching a head-on attack on the enemy attempting to invade north of Imugan, east of Malebang. At present, the enemy seems unable to counterattack, and the Japanese are on high alert. On the 26th, the enemy 7 kilometers south of Mount Balete in Urotakin gradually advanced under the cover of aircraft. Japanese troops deployed artillery and launched a fierce bombardment. In addition, a strike force dispatched by the Japanese Okayama unit attacked the enemy base northwest of Calanglang in that area, destroying five 15-cm howitzers, three mortars, one quick-firing gun, and four barracks, causing great confusion in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Approximately ninety unidentified B-29 aircraft, with their main force, attacked the Kanto area in two waves, and another group attacked the Shizuoka area. The first unit invading the Kanto area, numbering about fifty aircraft, dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on military supply factory areas in the northern Kanto region and west of the Keihin region for three hours from 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM. However, there was almost no damage to important factories. The second unit, numbering about thirty aircraft, dropped a mixture of bombs and incendiary bombs over the city streets of the Keihin region between 3:00 AM and 4:20 AM, causing fires in several locations, but they were soon extinguished. In addition, ten aircraft dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on military supply areas in the Shizuoka area between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM. On this day, enemy aircraft, in groups of one or several, dispersed and invaded from low altitudes of 2-3,000 meters. In addition to immediate bombing, many time bombs were dropped in various locations. The results of the Japanese counterattacks are currently under investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Invent Aircraft Fuel Refined from Camphor <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Dr. Tomizo Yahagi, Director of the Central Research Institute of the Monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, has invented that camphor and camphor oil can be used as explosives and engine oil through careful research. Its importance as a strategic material is highly valued. As a result of further research by Dr. Yahagi, the experiment on extracting paracytic systems of oil from camphor has been successful and will soon be industrialized on a large scale. This paracytic oil is particularly rich in high octane and can increase the octane number when mixed with other aircraft fuels, making it ideal as aircraft fuel. The refining method involves simply extracting camphor in a special way, which can be produced in large quantities, and camphor is a specialty of Japan, so it makes a great contribution to securing aviation fuel.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e8">Speculation and Floating Capital <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Since the Incident, the abnormal knot of the economy in Shanghai and even the entire Central China region can be attributed to the mischief of floating capital. However, looking back at the actual situation in recent years, the extent of its rampant wrongdoing and the degree of harm it has caused to the social economy and even the government's policies has never been as chaotic and serious as it is now.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been a concentration of floating capital, because Shanghai is the economic center of the country; various daily necessities needed in the interior are mostly supplied by Shanghai. At the beginning of the Incident, the security situation in various places was poor, and the bourgeoisie brought their funds to Shanghai to avoid the chaos, which further increased the amount of floating capital in Shanghai. According to the China Bank's business report in 1932, the funds concentrated in Shanghai accounted for more than half of the country's silver currency. There was no proper outlet, while the countryside was experiencing a shortage of funds and industrial depression. This is a clear proof of the economic deformity caused by the political disorder at that time. However, at that time, the total amount of silver currency in the country was only 2.2 billion yuan, and the circulating capital in Shanghai was only 600 million yuan, of which only about 400 million yuan could be identified as floating capital. At that time, various industries and businesses still had opportunities for normal development, so these floating capital did not have a malignant effect, and people with good intentions had already loudly called for the slogan of "funds returning to agriculture."</p>
<p>Until the eve of the Incident, the total deposits of Chinese banks in Shanghai were about 2 billion yuan, of which the amount of floating capital had remained at 5-600 million yuan for five or six years. However, it can be proved by looking at the proportion of long-term deposits of banks at more than 75% and current deposits at only 25% or less at that time. After the Incident, a large amount of funds once fled to Hong Kong, but after the Shanghai order was gradually restored, Hong Kong became insecure, and funds flowed back to Shanghai, forming a deformed prosperity for a time, and the wind of speculation gradually unfolded, and the problem of floating capital gradually became serious. However, because the environment in Shanghai at that time was not fundamentally different from that before the Incident, although there was a lot of floating capital, the ground for activities was still large, so it did not immediately form a major social problem. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the entire objective environment changed rapidly, and although some of the clear capital had been transferred to the interior, it flowed back to Shanghai again due to the lack of outlets in the interior. At the end of 1942, the floating capital in Shanghai reached a huge amount of about 7.4 billion yuan. The problem of the harm of capital became increasingly serious day by day.</p>
<p>In the two years from the end of 1942 to the present, the authorities have tried their best to prevent and control the activities of floating capital. In the beginning, measures such as the implementation of financial control and the ban on speculative markets (including foreign currency, foreign stocks, public bonds, raw silk, gauze, etc.), especially the purchase of gauze, created a temporary market quiet. After that, all measures, such as price countermeasures and the resumption of business of the stock exchange, failed to prevent the rampant floating capital, and the increase in circulating capital and the amount of floating capital reached an unprecedentedly large figure in the past two years. Since there was no proper outlet, they swarmed to the path of speculation and hoarding, using every change in the international situation, or even completely using rumors, to carry out unscrupulous speculation. However, the authorities only gave verbal warnings to these speculators. Although there were restrictive laws, they were like a dead letter, and there were no severe punishments to follow, which finally led to the chaotic and serious crisis today. The confusion in the market in the past few days has reached its peak. It goes without saying that the price of gold has soared. Taking the unified bonds as an example, the price was less than 30 yuan when the Central Reserve Bank notes were used in 1942. Later, because the National Government recognized the old debts, it rose to 100 yuan. At that time, the Northern Gang used the Joint Reserve Bank notes to purchase for arbitrage, which was only to break through the 100 yuan mark. Later, it gradually rose, and in the past few days, it has risen sharply and soared from thousands to tens of thousands of yuan! Looking at Chinese stocks again, from the beginning of the year to the recent few weeks, they have skyrocketed from several times to dozens of times. However, on the day the enemy planes came, the market situation in the morning and afternoon was very different. In the morning, some varieties even rose to the limit, but in the afternoon, they plummeted to the limit! For example, Wing On Textile Factory rose to 2,700 yuan, but suddenly fell to 1,840 yuan. Mei Ya Silk Factory rose to 2,820 yuan, but suddenly fell to 1,930 yuan. What are the losses suffered by the real investors during this period? What is the impact of the market being disrupted? It is enough to expose the wolfish hearts of the speculators! But what do speculators rely on to disrupt the market and destroy the social economy? Undoubtedly, it is relying on its huge floating capital?</p>
<p>Since the tool of speculation is such a huge amount of floating capital, in order to save the chaos in the market and the crisis of economic collapse, we should start with two things: curbing speculation as a temporary solution and guiding floating capital to the right track as a fundamental solution. Before we can strictly curb speculation, it is not easy to make the rampant floating capital comply. Therefore, first of all, we must thoroughly investigate the speculators who disrupt the market. In our editorial on March 31, we hoped that the municipal authorities would pay close attention to the criminal acts that endanger the wartime economy and immediately investigate and transfer them to the special court for decisive disposal in order to curb the chaos. As for the issue of guiding floating capital, we will discuss it further.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Capital Air Defense Work <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Ping</p>
<p>Strengthen Air Defense</p>
<p>Wartime air defense work is an extremely important issue. The city of Nanjing is the capital city, making it particularly important. Coupled with the recent frequent air raids, air defense work has become even more urgent. The progress of air defense work in the capital will be described in two points:</p>
<p>On the active side, it is nothing more than building a large number of air raid shelters. Only because the capital area is vast and the population is large, most people are often at a loss when they encounter an air raid, and cannot find a suitable place to avoid it for a while. Some people even wander the streets, causing them to be killed or injured by stray bullets and fragments. The reason for this is that the original air raid shelters were too simple and the number was too small. Last year, all the city's police defense personnel, volunteer police, and Baojia personnel were mobilized to dig air raid shelters, but at most there were only a few thousand. With each accommodating ten people, at most tens of thousands of people could be accommodated. If public and private institutions built their own underground shelters, they could also accommodate tens of thousands of people, which is not enough for the 700,000 citizens to hide.</p>
<p>In the past, the air raid shelters automatically dug by shops and residents in the city were relatively satisfactory, but most of the public air raid shelters built in the open have been filled in and cannot be used. Although the authorities have encouraged citizens to dig on their own, it is difficult for the public to implement it due to economic strength.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities have also taken measures to guide citizens to take appropriate shelter during air raids. They have selected open spaces or public places in each district as temporary shelters for citizens. They are also planning to build large air raid shelters and are organizing the existing air raid shelters.</p>
<p>On the passive side, in view of the fact that many victims of air raids in Pukou and Xiaguan in the past, the Nanjing Municipal Government established a "Nanjing Area Air Raid Disaster Countermeasures Committee" on February 14 to be solely responsible for air raid relief matters.</p>
<p>The relief methods are divided into two categories: damage to houses, with a maximum relief of 10,000 yuan, and 3,000 to 5,000 yuan for half-damaged or less. Deaths and injuries: 3,000 to 5,000 yuan for the dead, 1,000 to 3,000 yuan for the seriously injured, and 500 to 1,000 yuan for the slightly injured. The committee is jointly organized by the Chinese and Japanese sides. Part of the funding is borne by the Chinese and Japanese local authorities, and part is subsidized and raised by the central government. The relief targets are limited to the Chinese and Japanese people in the Nanjing area.</p>
<p>Blood Type Testing</p>
<p>Regarding air defense rescue and prevention work, the authorities have recently decided on new measures. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of Health will launch a blood type testing program. The four drafts of the "National People's Blood Type Testing Program Outline," "Organization Regulations of the Blood Type Testing Committee of the Ministry of Health," "General Rules for the Organization of Blood Type Testing Committees of Provinces, Cities, and Counties," and "Implementation Measures for Blood Type Testing" drafted by the Ministry of Health have all been passed at the 245th Executive Yuan meeting on March 13.</p>
<p>The Blood Type Testing Committee was established on March 25. The director will be concurrently held by Director Lu, and other ministers and vice ministers of relevant departments and the heads of health agencies will serve as members.</p>
<p>The committee is the central highest advisory body for testing work, used to supervise and direct the testing work of provinces, cities, and counties. As for the materials needed, the committee will distribute them from the central government, and the provinces and cities will raise them themselves in addition to the allocation by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Those who are tested are divided into two types, A and B. Type A are civil servants, military police, groups, companies, factories, etc. Type B are the general public. The local blood type testing committee will form several testing teams in conjunction with local public and private hospital medical associations to test in districts, and at the same time, it will work with police agencies and Baojia organizations to assist in the process.</p>
<p>After the people have been tested, the blood type category will be indicated in red on the right side of the photo on their residence permit or service permit, so that blood can be transfused immediately in case of excessive blood loss due to injury during an air raid. The testing fee is tentatively set at 50 yuan per person, and the poor can be reduced or exempted as appropriate.</p>

<p>Byrnes Resigns as a Result</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report - According to foreign news reports, War Mobilization Director James F. Byrnes has resigned, and Federal Loan Administrator Vinson has been appointed as his successor. It is reported that Byrnes expressed his intention to resign to Roosevelt on March 24th, the day the Allied forces crossed the Rhine River. After resigning, he told reporters on the 29th, "I have decided to resign because I am aware of the nature of the work I am currently undertaking." The "work he is currently undertaking" refers to the mobilization plan for manpower and resources needed for the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Loss of Confidence in Maintaining Combat Power</p>
<p>From our observation, Byrnes seems to have lost confidence in the United States' ability to maintain combat power until "the day of victory," hence his resignation. The Washington authorities announced, three days after Byrnes submitted his resignation, his proposed reduction of the shipbuilding plan, stating that this plan was determined based on an investigation into the amount of human resources necessary for the overall military plan. Navy Secretary Forrestal further echoed that this plan was proposed by Byrnes and has been fully accepted by the regular board. Upon investigation, the content of the reduced shipbuilding plan changed the original plan to build 84 combat ships (636,860 tons) to building 12 escort aircraft carriers (151,000 tons). Whether this reduction plan can save the shipbuilding industry and manpower is not known in detail, but Byrnes, who accompanied the delegation from the Crimea Conference to Washington, said to people that he had made a combat plan that required more personnel than in the past, meaning that future combat plans would require more personnel and would be quite difficult.</p>
<p>Significant Increase in the Number of Female Workers Mobilized</p>
<p>Regarding the number of female workers mobilized in the United States, in April 1940, there were 11 million, which increased to 16 million by April 1944. The United States not only lacks human resources but also faces a shortage of iron, steel, ships, and food, which are the reasons for the current reduction in the shipbuilding plan. Commander of the United States Fleet, Admiral King, in his work report for the past year, said that the speed of our advance has created new production problems. The accelerated pace of our operations requires a large consumption of certain important materials. The production of these materials is generally in short supply. This "new production problem" and the large consumption of "certain materials" have proven that the United States' Pacific War has reached a critical point.</p>
<p>Panic over Supply of Materials</p>
<p>In the United States military production industry, only ammunition exceeded the planned amount in January. Other manufactured goods decreased by one percent compared to December, with the biggest reason being the reduction in iron and steel raw materials. The same situation exists for warships. Under Secretary of State Grew, in a speech to the Foreign Press Association on March 1, said, "During the first sixty days of the Luzon and Iwo Jima operations, the United States mobilized 3.8 million tons of ships." The ongoing Okinawa operation and other areas require even more ships. If this continues, the supply of military materials to the United States is almost limitless, and there will inevitably be a day when a material panic occurs. In fact, the United States' combat power has already reached its limit. From this, we can know that Byrnes's decision to resign was made with full knowledge of the reasons, which is beyond doubt.</p>

<p>Department Head Izubuchi Discusses the War Situation at a Press Conference</p>
<p>The Army Press Department of Japan, an ally, held a regular press conference in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Department Head Izubuchi, Lieutenant Maehara, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Department Head Izubuchi spoke about the significant implications of the Japanese army's occupation of the Laohekou airfield and the trend of the fighting on Okinawa Island. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland War Situation</p>
<p>The recent Japanese army's incursion into the Laohekou airfield is of great significance: Militarily, it can protect Wuhan on one hand and attack Chongqing on the other. Laohekou is a strategic point in the north, a must-grab for military strategists. From now on, the Japanese army can freely decide on both offensive and defensive actions. After the Japanese army destroyed the US Air Force bases in Guilin and Liuzhou, Laohekou became a forward base for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Since December of last year, the US Air Force has used this base to frequently disrupt transportation along the Pinghan, Longhai, and Yangtze River areas. After the Japanese army captured the Ganzhou and Suichuan airfields, the US Air Force in this area became even more active. With one stroke, the Japanese army destroyed the US Air Force, forcing them to retreat to Ankang. From now on, the Japanese army can take this route to attack Chongqing while also firmly defending Wuhan. Geographically, Laohekou is a key point in the west facing Chongqing and in the south facing Guizhou, so whether moving from south to north or from east to west, a path has been opened. Furthermore, since the Japanese army occupied Laohekou, the rear of the Chongqing 10th War Area has been completely cut off, forming an isolated situation.</p>
<p>Okinawa War Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the war situation on the Pacific Okinawa Islands, Department Head Izubuchi said that both the Japanese and American sides are fighting fiercely with all their might. The Japanese army has inflicted great losses on the American forces, and the Japanese army has achieved even greater results. The number of American ships sunk or damaged has reached more than 170. The US Navy's operations in the Okinawa area are far from their home country, so their supply situation is extremely difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e20">The City Held a Children's Day Celebration Yesterday <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Luo Represented Mayor Zhou in Giving a Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Fourth of April Children's Day in our country. In addition to hosting a Children's Day celebration, the city's Education Bureau also held an awards ceremony for the 4th Annual Infant Health Competition. The event took place at the Paramount Theater on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday at 10:00 AM. Mayor Zhou was invited to attend and give a speech, but due to official business, he was unable to attend and sent Secretary-General Luo to represent him. All elementary and secondary schools were closed to celebrate, all city parks were open for free for the day, and all movie theaters and shops offered half-price discounts. Shanghai Radio broadcast special Children's Day programs, creating an unprecedentedly grand occasion.</p>
<p>Guests in Attendance</p>
<p>In addition to Secretary-General Luo representing Mayor Zhou, city officials and guests from various organizations who attended the celebration included Dai Yingfu, Yuan Junchang, Xu Jidun, Liu Dexuan, Chen Jiwu, Wang Yan, Shen Shengfeng, Wu Pengfei, Dai Wangheng, Wu Chui, Wang Mengxian, and others, as well as students from various schools and parents of the infant health competition participants, totaling over a thousand people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The bands from the Shanghai Poor Children's Home and the Poor Children's Craft Institute played music, and the Youth Corps maintained order.</p>
<p>Health Competition</p>
<p>The meeting started on time. The chairman reported on the progress of the infant health competition. Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, gave a speech, followed by a speech on common infant care practices by Dr. Gui Zhiliang of the Health Bureau. The results of the infant health competition were announced:</p>
<p>(Group A) Cao Peiliang, Li Zongwei, Zhang Zhongli, Yao Zhigan, Fang Zheng, Zheng Yizhi, Ding Guoquan, Ke Benfang, Huang Tianmin, Liu Lingxiao.</p>
<p>(Group B) Zhao Tiantian, Tian Jun, Fan Zhaoxiong, Zhang Jingbo, Pan Saizhen, Guo Dacheng.</p>
<p>(Group C) Huang Jun, Xue Wen, Li Guansen, Yu Runxian, Wang Boping, Ping, Zhang Jiedong, Pan Yanyan, Ling Jinxianggen, Zhu Huadi.</p>
<p>(Group D) Tang Dexiang, Lei Minmin, Zhou Lei, Qu Miaogen, Chen Desheng, Cao Wenbao, Yan Jinlong, Wu Shumei, Liang Liwu, Zhu Huanan, etc., totaling 40 people. An awards ceremony was held, hosted by Mrs. Fan, wife of Director Dai. Photos were taken of the winning babies, followed by the screening of the film "The Little Orphan's Paradise." The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Dai, the director, delivered the opening speech: "Today is the Fourth of April Children's Day, and we are also holding the awards ceremony for the city's 4th Annual Infant Health Competition. We deeply feel that being a human is most magnificent, and children are even more magnificent. Therefore, on this Fourth of April Children's Day, our bureau has specially organized the infant health competition. The actual work is funded by the Municipal Experimental Public Education Center. Our association has been handling infant registration matters since March 20th. For the convenience of travel, the city is divided into five registration areas: east, west, north, south, and central. The participating infants are divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, based on their date of birth. A total of 366 people participated. March 31st and April 1st were the dates for checking the infants' physical condition: 244 people participated. For the sake of caution, our association organized a judging committee to determine the rankings and distribute the prizes. Each group is required to select the top ten, for a total of forty in all four groups. The number of participants in this session is greater than in previous sessions, the results are better than in the past, and the prizes are more numerous, indicating that the people of our city are paying more attention to infant health than in the past, which is a fortunate thing. However, there are a few points that I would like to bring to everyone's attention: The results of this examination show that most of the children who are growing up fat are those who are breastfed by their mothers. Mothers who love cleanliness generally have clean children. Some children are still breastfeeding at the age of one and a half, which is wrong. Some children have not been vaccinated against smallpox at the age of two, which is also wrong. There were more boys (176) than girls (68) participating in this infant competition, and the physical condition of boys was also better than that of girls, which seems to indicate a preference for boys over girls, which is also wrong."</p>
<p>Secretary-General's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo delivered a speech, stating briefly: "Today is the Fourth of April Children's Day, and we are also using today to hold the city's 4th Annual Infant Health Competition. I am deeply grateful to all the parents who have led their beloved and cherished children to participate enthusiastically. Standing in the position of the municipal government, I would like to express my deep gratitude. Today, I would like to offer three suggestions, and I sincerely hope that all parents will pay attention:</p>
<p>First, why pay attention to the issue of children's education and infant care? This point is of great significance. Ancient China paid attention to nurturing from an early age, paying close attention to it during pregnancy, what is called prenatal education. Everything about children when they grow up, especially the issue of education, must be given even more attention. Originally, teaching and learning are two separate things. In China, parents only focus on the 'nurturing' aspect and pay little attention to the 'teaching' aspect. For example, young children usually like to eat whatever they want, and parents allow them to eat whatever they like, which will inevitably turn them into wild children. Therefore, more attention must be paid to prenatal education in national education. Otherwise, neglecting infants will have a significant impact on society and the country in the future. I sincerely hope that all parents will pay attention to prenatal education in the future, properly educate and nurture their children, and pay attention to children's education and youth education, which will not only benefit the country and society but also make no small contribution to the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>Secondly, parents often neglect their educational obligations towards their children due to excessive love, allowing them to eat whatever they want, and even when they are infants, they only care about their own preferences and do not consider the infants' discomfort. In fact, this motivation is for parents to love their own children, but the result is to harm the children. Therefore, because love causes harm, it not only does not benefit children and infants but even harms them.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in today's extraordinary situation, the lives of the general public are deeply troubled. Parents still feel that life is not enough, so they do not care about their children. I sincerely hope that all parents in the city will try their best to avoid difficulties and make their best efforts to protect their children.</p>
<p>The last point to pay more attention to is what is usually called longevity and wealth. In fact, longevity is needed, but wealth is not necessary, because the longevity of every child is of great importance to the future of the country and the nation. I sincerely hope that parents will educate and nurture young children and be truly responsible for the country and society. I hope that at the next Children's Day, all the people of the city will participate enthusiastically, so that the infant competition can be held on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Gifts of Grace</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library held a reading report competition and gave gifts of grace to children yesterday to celebrate Children's Day. It started at 9:00 AM in the morning, and gifts were distributed simultaneously at the main library and its branches. Directors Lin Kanghou, Ying Yongyu, and Huang Jingwan's family, and as many as 6,000 children came to read, which was a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e21">The Education Bureau Will Hold the Spring Sacrifice to Confucius Ceremony Today <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou Presides Over the Ceremony, Secretary-General Luo and Others Assist</p>
<p>Today is the day of the Spring Sacrificial Ceremony to the Sage Confucius. The Municipal Education Bureau will hold a grand Spring Sacrificial Ceremony at the Confucius Temple in Nanshi at 10:00 AM today. Mayor Zhou will be the chief officiant, and Secretary-General Luo, Director Xu, Director Xu, Deputy Director Lu, and Director Dai will assist in the ceremony. Municipal government advisors, directors of various bureaus and departments, and administrative supervisors will be secondary officiants. All officials of the municipal government and county magistrates are eligible to participate in the ceremony. It is stipulated that civil officials wear blue robes and black jackets or national dress, military officers wear military uniforms, and students wear uniforms. Seating will be arranged with civil officials to the east and military officials to the west, with students from various schools in the back. Furthermore, the Shandong Shanghai Compatriot Association on Ximen Road is scheduled to hold a Spring Sacrificial Ceremony to Confucius at the Zhidao Hall of the association at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. In addition to the directors and supervisors presiding over the ceremony, all members are expected to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Investigation of the Shanghai-Ningbo Route <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>The ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route include the "Wansheng" and "Haitong" of the China Shipping Company, and the "Xin Ningshao," "Zi Maru," and "Xingdong" of the East Asia Marine Transportation Company. Their operating schedules are not fixed. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>China Shipping Company</p>
<p>The address is 4 Beijing Road. First, second, and third-class tickets are sold there. Fourth-class tickets are sold by the agent, Lida Company, at the Jinliyuan Wharf on Xin Kaihe. The fares are 18,720 yuan for first class, 11,240 yuan for second class, 6,875 yuan for third class, and 3,850 yuan for fourth class. The "Wansheng" ship can carry 4,000 passengers, and the "Haitong" can also accommodate slightly less than 3,000. However, first, second, and third-class tickets are extremely difficult to purchase, and few fourth-class tickets are sold openly. The docking locations are wharves 6, 7, 13 and the old Taikoo Wharf on the Bund. The departure time is usually 2:00 PM, and ticket sales start at 10:00 AM on the morning of the sailing date.</p>
<p>East Asia Marine Transportation Company</p>
<p>The head office is at 5 The Bund, and there are two agents: Anda Company at 122 Guangdong Road and Wang Chunji at Room 317, 851 Beijing Road (intersection of Xizang Road). The fares are 19,800 yuan for first class, 12,300 yuan for second class, 7,840 yuan for third class, and 3,810 yuan for fourth class. Fourth-class passengers must pay an additional 500 yuan for food.</p>
<p>The sailing schedules of the "Xin Ningshao," "Zi Maru," and "Xingdong" ships fluctuate greatly and are not announced in advance. Changes are often made temporarily. In order to prevent passengers from running around in vain, the Wang Chunji agency implements a pre-registration method, where tickets are sent by someone when there is a ship. The intention is excellent, and a handling fee of 200 yuan is charged for each ticket, but there are occasional cases of not charging according to the rules.</p>
<p>Conditions at the Wharf and Onboard</p>
<p>For luggage transportation, there is the publicly operated Shanghai Bund Wharf Travel Service, which charges 400 yuan for large items and 200 yuan for small items. (Passengers' luggage must be transported by them. Small packages are also not allowed to be carried. The handling fee is as high as 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per item, which urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>After the ship departs, there are still sampans carrying passengers who climb aboard halfway. The hoisting fee is 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Passengers without tickets are secretly helped to buy tickets by the waiters. The market price for a berth for a fourth-class passenger is about 10,000 yuan, and food and other expenses are also quite expensive. Therefore, travelers on this route must bring more travel expenses to avoid being in a difficult situation.</p>

<p>On the first of this month, several American P-51 fighter planes invaded the Shanghai area and dropped bombs in the suburbs, causing very little damage on the ground. However, the enemy's evil nature erupted, and they actually strafed Chinese civilians with machine guns, resulting in deaths and injuries. According to police investigation, eleven men were killed by gunfire, and two were seriously injured. In addition, one man and one woman were slightly injured. The enemy aircraft strafed innocent Chinese civilians, which is inhumane, and all who heard of it were filled with hatred.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, considering the difficulty for retailers in paying for the upcoming distribution of the 19th installment of allotted sugar and to facilitate the process, will still offer two options: pre-payment in cash and secured delivery with payment after sale. Retailers who cannot pre-pay in cash and request secured delivery must bring their store seal to the office on the 5th and 6th of this month to collect the security agreement, fill it out according to the form, and stamp it.
