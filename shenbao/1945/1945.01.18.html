<h3>呂宋平原北激戰　日軍以突擊創敵　仁牙因面主力部隊接觸</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十七日中央社電　敵軍目呂宋島之迎法比安，仁牙因灣一帶登陸後，復企圖繼續前進，窺犯內地，對此，日軍陸地部隊予敵以猛烈邀擊，予以重創，依然確保陣地，阻止敵軍前進，士氣極爲旺盛。聖法比安方面，九日敵軍自該地登陸後，十日即開始東進，侵入比提波羅方而，一部北進窺犯馬比勞方面，同時另一部敵軍更向東南挺進，突入瑪納奧方面。又於達莫爾迭斯，聖多馬斯附近開始新登陸之敵軍，目下以聖法比安爲中心，於的十公里內外之圈內，與日軍繼續激戰。聖多馬斯方面敵兵，至十二日傍晚的五百餘名，達莫爾迭斯南方地區的三百餘名，嗣曾進攻日軍陣地，然日軍到處勇行突擊，收莫大戰果，將其擊退。瑪納奧方面，的有敵軍一營，擁有載車十五輛，野砲四，迫擊砲若干，目下正自瑪納奧南方卡保南髙地前進，正面亦有敵戰車若干，出現於日軍陣地前方，成爲日軍砲火目標。仁牙因灣方面，敵軍遭日航空部隊及陸地砲火猛攻，損失慘重，現正繼續增援部隊，十二日夜，戰車部隊之主力似已登陸，現該方面敵軍已自仁牙因南下，即與日軍第一綫主力部隊接觸。</p>
<h3>聖法比安方面　敵行動被阻　馬尼剌附近美艦受創</h3>
<p>菲律賓十七日中央社電　據十五日晚情報，呂宋島達莫爾迭斯東方二公里之處，有戰車三十顧之敵來犯，日軍即予以痛擊，將之擊退。又馬比勞北方四公里處之髙地，的有敵軍兩大隊侵入，目下激戰中。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　本日菲律賓方面戰况如次：呂宋平原北部班加新安平地之美軍，頃已逐次與日軍接觸，故呂宋戰鬥正次第髙潮中，尤其聖法比安東方地區之敵左翼部隊，其行動已趨活潑，十一日新上陸之敵軍，自達莫爾迭斯至加廳旁地帶，於此長達三十五公里之戰綫，已全面迫近日軍陣地，該方面日。美兩軍，於過去數日曾展開激戰，但美軍每次皆負重創，日軍堅陣則未受任何影響。又仁牙因西方地區，敵曾接近阿古諾河左側地區之日軍陣地，故此方面之戰鬥亦將日趨激烈，目下敵軍中央部並未有任何顯著進展，日軍方面刻亦正養精蓄銳，正待好轉。至於仁牙因灣上可望見之敵軍艦船，多數已被毀或傾斜，又與此相呼應者，自呂宋島東方海面北上襲擊台灣之敵機動部隊，其後曾以主力侵入南中國，實則所予敵之損失更大。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　呂宋島之美第六軍，抵達阿古諾河後，有南下之勢，據前綫消息，美軍以機甲部隊進窺塔拉克巡，但其左翼在聖法比安方面之前進，已遭日軍遇止。又據美聯社十五日訊：日軍對美軍左翼砲擊，致美軍陣地動搖。另電稱：過去二三夜內，日軍以後方麼陵陣地之重砲，對美軍橋頭堡之左翼猛加砲擊，仁牙因西方，十五日亦有小規模之接觸戰。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　紐約泰晤士報十六日揭載呂宋島戰况如次。日軍將全兵力漸漸集中於呂宋島，自無疑問，至目下爲止，日軍之態度甚爲愼重，山下大將等將在馬尼刺北方猛烈抵抗，可以預料，美軍目下之進攻，完全失策，其前進必將遭遇極大之困難。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，十五日空襲巴打雁及馬尼刺海面附近之美艦，據美軍發表，該役蒙若干損失。</p>
<h3>美艦載機編隊　襲華財各地</h3>
<p>澳門亦遭轟炸</p>
<p>大陸基地十七日中央社電　華南方面之敵機動部隊，十六日又以巨人艦載機累計約三百數十架，空襲華南方面，而對飛機塲，船舶及其他設施，實行機槍掃射。按敵機於十六日上午九時起，即以累計有數十架之編隊襲香港地區，八十架襲廣東地區，下午一時起敵復以累計有數十架之編隊，攻擊杳港地區，而達二小時許，斯時日軍制空部隊當即邀戰，迄現在已判明擊落其八架，又上午來襲之敵機中，曾有二十餘架非法侵害中立國葡萄牙屬之澳門地區，實行機槍掃射。</p>
<h3>發揮傳統精神　有馬少將晉級</h3>
<p>日海省常動局同時發表</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日海軍省及賞勳局，十六日上午零時發表：對去年十月敵機動部隊企圖於雷伊泰島登陸，出現於菲律賓東方海面時，身爲空軍司令官而身先士卒，以衝撞戰術敢行猛攻敵艦之有馬少將。此次特發令予以晋級。當時收獲之戰果，爲炸沉敵空母一艘，炸毀空母二艘，並使之起吹，炸毀巡洋艦一艘，縱觀以上戰果，可知海軍傳統之指揮官身先士卒之眞精神，已發揮無遺，故全軍應繼有馬少將之後，以神風特攻隊之精神，繼續忠烈，爲國作戰。</p>
<h3>日皇與陳代主席　互換書翰　中日國交益加親密</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　日天　陛下，爲慶祝中日兩國國交益加親密，表彰至誠之友誼，特親翰我國政府陳代主席，並派駐華谷大便贈與旭日桐花大綬章，陳代主席茲於十七日親致答翰，表示謝忱，謹錄兩盡原文如后：</p>

<p>陳代主席宴谷大使</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　國府陳代主席以日天皇陛下贈與旭日桐花大綬章，特以親翰答謝，幷於十七日晚七時在主席官邸宴日本駐華谷大使曁前田中將，太田參事官，岸參事官，淸水書記官，髙橋書記官諸氏，幷邀褚外交部畏，林安徽省長，趙宣傳部長，周行政院務書長等作陪。</p>
<p>日　壯團決議死鬥維護國體</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　　贊壯年團以十六日爲創立四周年紀念日，特於是日下午一時，在該會館舉行總務會議，出席者有顧問菊池男爵等二十餘人，對敵美之轟炸伊勢神域，作下項決議，三時許散會，茲誌該決議如次：「伊勢神域橫遭敵人轟炸，誠令人恐懼憤激之至，敵之意在破壞皇國國體，昭然若揭，是以吾等國民誓必死鬥，以維護團體，澈底實行翼贊，抱滅賊必勝之心，誓於神明之前」</p>
<h3>B29型機　損毀統計</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　美空軍以成都爲基地之B29型機，自去年六月十二日轟炸日本北九州及本土西部以來，迄今已達十次。又馬利亞納之敵B29型機，自十一月二十四日轟炸東京以來，今已達十一次，對東京附近及中察，不斷繼續以神經戰。按B29型機純爲空襲日本本土而設者，然成都至福岡二千二百公里，塞班至東京二千二百八十公里之距離，對其活動不無限制，更自日軍防空陣之活躍，對敵之進襲，已予更大威脅。觀B29十一次之來襲，總數爲一千二百五十架，其中爲日軍擊落一百七十八架，擊毀　百四十六架，擊落率爲　成四，擊毀率爲一成九。　落之一百七十八架中，十七架爲撞落者。由此可以想見邀擊之苛，繫落B29架烈，可使其六十五萬美金之生產費，七萬小時之勞力，化歸雲霧。又至少斃其航空員十二名，故算來在日本本土已使敵喪失一億一千五百七十萬萬美金，二千一百三十六名之航空員。此外日空軍對馬利亞納，成都，加爾各答等敵基地數次予以攻擊，合計擊損燃燒敵達一百八十一架。又滿洲方面亦擊落十一架，其在地上擊毀及空中擊毀或需要大加修理者，自去年六月十六日迄今七個月間，最少已達五百四十架以上，許多B29型已自敵軍作戰指導部指揮下脫離矣。</p>
<h3>阿諾爾德談話</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據華盛頓訊，美陸軍航空部長阿諾爾德，十三日夜關於對日戰爭事發表聲明如次：過去數週B29型之轟炸日本，不過首開其端，今後將遇更困難之苦戰。又日本於太平洋地區已獲得豐富之資源，且均積極開發其工業及農業，殆已自給自足，而規模的當德國之三倍，同時該工業組織現已予以分散，故美空軍刻正準備對之轟炸。</p>
<h3>空襲緬境敵機　墜毀十五架　臘戍以西美渝軍受創</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　軍戰鬥機隊，十五日下午於緬甸中部地區，邀擊上午企圖來　之敵P47型機的六架，將其一架擊落，二架擊毀，日方亦有二架未歸還。又該日日軍地上部隊防空砲火之射擊，將敵P47型及蚊式飛機編隊擊落二架，擊毀二架。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十七日中央社電　敵機對日軍機塲之來襲仍極執拗，十三日緬甸中部梅克特拉地方日空軍基地，有敵機二十架來襲，日軍以地上火器擊落其兩架，擊毀三架，十五日該機塲又情敵機三架來製，日軍戰鬥機予以邀擊，擊落其二架，擊毀一架，日方無損害。</p>
<p>北緬前綫十七日中央社電　北緬美渝軍，由八莫南下，與雲南遠征軍相呼應，企圖打通萊多公路及滇甸公路之聯絡，一在臘戍西，於十九公里地方蠶動，經日軍勇敢迎擊後，受損甚大，日軍敢死隊於一月一日迄十一日，擊斃渝軍二百七十名，鹵獲火箭砲一及軍服彈藥多數，一月上旬對雲南遠征軍之邀擊戰中，斃渝軍無數，鹵獲槍械彈藥無數。</p>
<h3>敵機再度襲漢　展開邀擊戰　擊落敵機約三十架</h3>
<p>漢口十七日中央社電　十四日下午，美駐渝空軍以P40P47P51及B29型機等的九十架，再度來製武漢地區，對市區盲目投彈，日戰鬥機隊及地上砲火，當與敵機展開邀擊戰，的四小時，擊落敵機的三十架，日方亦有五架自炸，軍事設施受損極輕。茲誌戰果內容如次；（一）空戰擊落P47型七架，P51型五架，擊毀P47型二架，P51型五架。（二）地上砲火擊落P47型三架P40型三架，（內二架未證實）P51型二架，擊毀P47型二架P51型二架（內一架未證實）。</p>

<p>戰時的重要都市，遭遇敵機轟炸，原是無可避免的。尤其在緊張的決戰階段，敵人爲企圖擾亂我後方人心，實施神經戰略，盲目轟炸，更在意料之中。上海是大東亞戰爭後方重要基地，所以，成爲敵機轟炸目標，也是可能的事。我們並不是故作危詞，以聳聽聞。實在對於現實環境的可能性，不能不加以特別重視。</p>
<p>上海人口稠密，在敵機的盲目轟炸下，無辜犧牲自屬難免。因此，在積極方面，需要增强防空設備，提髙防空效能。在消極方面，瞭解防空常識，滅少生命危險。同時，不必要居留上海者，盡量疏散，避免無謂犧牲。所以，戰時都市的人口疏散問題，在原則上已毋庸討論了。</p>
<p>人口疏散，在市民方面應自動的積極準備，在當局方面也應從速計劃佈置。勿存觀望僥倖苟安心理，一旦事到臨頭，手足無措，慌張凌亂。我們在去年十二月二十六日社評中。已曾提出疏散人口應行顧到的數點，這裏，我們首先應確定疏散人口的範圍，例如無業流民，各慈癢團體如養老慈幼等等，無固定職業的髙等寓公，家庭間的老弱婦孺，以及其他不必留居上海的居民。其次，由當局組織疏散委員會，最主要工作就是疏散歸鄉的交通問題，應特別佈置，必須做到週密與便利。並與火車輪船等各交通機關取得聯絡，爲疏散人口專闢車船。疏散至本市近郊者，組織步行隊，分站步行。沿途站頭並設招待所，照顧服務，减少疏散者之痛苦。並視疏散者之經濟能力，酌予免費或减費。從另一方面觀察，在目前本市的居民中，自願疏散歸鄉者，也頗不乏人。例如各機關團體及工商界的被裁人員，以及感於上海生活不易維持的人，都想乘機回鄕，可是，因爲交通的困難，無法成行，車票船票旣難購得，而行李物件更不能携帶，沿途旣多需索，車站黑帽子的竊取又爲可惡，行旅者視爲畏途。所以，交通問題的有無辦法，實爲疏散人口的先決問題。疏散者旣然歸鄉，則隨身衣物自需携帶應用，任何人不願棄之不顧。所以，交通工具固然需要增加供應，而交通職工的服務，也須特別熱心。</p>
<p>日前火車上的車僮—就是黑帽子，需索竊取，留雖旅客，跋扈之至，已爲每一個旅客所切齒深惡，如果不加以嚴厲取締，不但疏散人口無法實現，即普通旅客亦視爲畏途，成爲鐵路管理上莫大的汚點。車僮不過是車上的侍者，爲什麽跋扈至此，而路政當局充耳不聞，一任肆無忌憚，毀壞路譽，實在是不可理解的事。整個鐵路管理機構，竟對最低級的侍役無法管理，焉能管理整個路政，更談不到爲旅客服務了。本報在一月六日的社評中，曾以取締類似黑帽子索詐一事，舉爲能否澄淸吏治的試金石。難道政治的力量不及黑箱子的力量不成？我們盼望當局以一個月爲限，澈底取締黑帽子的跋扈行爲。不但便利疏散人口的實現，也可洗刷路政汚點。現在本市警察局已在北站添設分局，警戒車站秩序及檢査列車旅客。我們更希望首先糾正類似黑帽子的索詐行爲。</p>

<h3>日義會定期再開　將推進強力政治　政府重視必勝態勢之整備</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日第八十六次議會，將於二十一日再開，日政府於此次議會擬行整備法案及預算案，且首相於此次議會中發表之施政方針演說，已示明政府斷行決戰施策之決意，並促進國民之奮起。同時，翼政會對左列各點極爲重視。（一）此次議會應置重點於强力政治之推進及決戰士氣之昻揚，菲律賓之戰局已益形嚴重，而日本之興廢，亦於此決定。同時，於決戰體制下，關於總力動員之施策之實行，亦爲當前急務。目前須將一億國民結爲「全體特攻隊」，加以組織，加以訓練，故此次議會之重要課題，當爲强力政治之推進。（一）就以上一點觀之，可知決戰下之此次議會，對其任務之運用，誠適當其時也。故若避忌政府，進忌國民，而拘於自已立塲，則將漠視其於此重大危局下所開議會之眞養也。（一）此次議會之言論，須當活潑化，而各委員會所提出之質問，亦須望政府於今次議會後，積極果斷實行各施策。（一）如是則議論內容，於政府方面，益重視國務與統帥之更趨緊密化及必勝態勢之整備等，同時，對國民士氣之昻揚，與夫軍需生產，勞務輸送，防空體制，國民生產等諸問題，亦極重視，然縱觀最近之趨向，可知將國內體制一元化問題，認作翼政會之自身問題，而求解決之空氣極爲濃厚。過去關於該問題，委員會方面大多主張翼政會之解體論，而翼政會之內部情形亦極複雜，政府方面自小林總裁入閣後，以翼政會爲背景，而加整頓，以期與議會聯成一體，俾得行强力政治之運營，故於最大限度內，當活用此次議會，並獲得國民之支持，而把握施行決戰施策之機運也。</p>
<h3>波蘭南部　展開空前大戰　德軍放棄基爾斯市</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　東綫戰鬥最烈者爲波蘭南部，蘇聯之第一島克蘭軍於連續五十六公里之戰綫渡越尼達河後，將其先鋒轉向東北，强襲甚爾斯市（Kielce），據德軍報稱，該市經巷戰之後，已行放棄。在維斯杜拉·布格兩河間之三角地帶及那萊夫河橋頭堡，蘇軍亦以相當優勢兵力，形成深度突入部，德豫備軍現正反攻中。東普魯士國境戰事無大變化。</p>
<p>蘇後備兵調赴前綫</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍事發言人昨日指陳，德軍在東綫之奮勇抗戰，及敵軍損失之慘重，可由蘇軍長官調動大隊後備軍至戰區作戰證明之。</p>
<p>冬季攻勢三項目標</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫戰事今後爲世人所矚目，蘇軍冬季攻勢現在波羅的海與喀爾巴阡間進行中。蘇軍調集兵員甚衆，斯達林之目的不僅欲突入上西里西亞工業區而已，且亦欲擊潰華沙區之德軍堅强陣地，或欲對東普魯士實施大規模之鉗形進攻，藉以決定此次戰事。蘇軍此次冬季攻勢，抱此上述三項目的，全力爲之，實欲一鼓而擊潰東綫德軍。但今引爲疑問者，即蘇軍在去秋英美軍發動攻勢之際，何不同施進攻，以決定此次戰爭。吾人所可答覆者，殆係當時蘇軍尙未準備就緒，而艾森霍華則欲獨佔征服德國之功，故不候其與國而即先施進攻。其次斯達林或早料及英美軍秋季攻勢必遭失敗，故不出擊，以待德軍在西綫枯竭之後，東綫防務削弱，遂使蘇軍易於進攻，實則此皆彼之估計錯誤。</p>

<p>沮里希十七日中央社電　據安加拉電：日駐土耳其大使與隨員及領事，已準備歸國，其他日僑亦全部於最近經由蘇聯返國。</p>

<h3>西綫亞登區德軍　進行解脫運動　南翼戰事無甚變化</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：最近二十四小時內，西綫戰事無重大變化。德軍在東亞登按照預定計劃，進行解脫運動以保全實力。反軸心軍受此運動之影響，損失頗重。德軍自薩爾姆流域北面與東面及威爾茲與狄埃寇許間之南面增加壓力，使美軍迄未能突入德軍陳地。西綫其他各段，美軍在萊米許·薩爾勞頓等地之行動，僅係一稱聲東擊西之努力。美軍在薩爾格米特東面與東南所施之壓力，集中在佛日區之德軍側翼，但幷無顯著成效。哈頓與里達霍芬方面，反軸心軍在馬奇諾防綫內苦戰，幷無進展。</p>
<h3>德釋放蘇戰俘</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍第一批戰俘一百七十三人，因在德國有特殊功績，已在符拉索夫將軍之前　以釋放。德戰俘總監致詞稱，蘇聯雖非日內瓦條約簽字國，但德國站於人道立塲上，特照章予以釋放。</p>

<p>英相向議會聲明</p>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　海通社訊：邱吉爾昨夜在英下院聲明，大西洋憲章並非法律，羅斯福總統亦曾於去年十二月二十二日作同樣之聲明。或問大西洋憲章能否實行於歐洲一半之版圖，首相能否說明可實行此需章之聖安在，邱氏答稱，關於此事，本人認爲無費述之必要。</p>
<h3>渝共談判破裂經過（一）</h3>
<p>去年九月十五日渝參政會第三次大會中，渝共雙方提出之報吿及文件，足以充分暴露渝共問衝突之激烈及妥協之不可能性。曾在去年十月七九兩日本報分載片段，茲復覔得全文，內容詳盡，特再刊載於后，俾窺全豹。</p>

<p>二</p>
<p>因林福極先生已有具體意見表示，我們遷於五月十七日同林祖涵先生回重慶，當時中央正要開十二中全會及全國行政會議，雖在百忙之中，仍然將在西安談話經過及林祖涵先生所表示意見，報吿中央，由中央考慮解決此項問題之具體方案，於大月五日的林祖涵先生晤面，即將「中央對中共問題政治解決提示案」文件一種，面交林祖涵先生，其原文如左：</p>
<p>三十三年六月五日中央對中共問題政治解決提示案</p>
<p>茲以林代表祖涵在西安所表示之意見爲基礎，作以下之提示案：</p>
<p>甲　關於軍事問題</p>

<p>九，其他各地區，所有中共自行設立之行動機構，應一律由各該省政府派員接管處理。</p>
<p>丙　關於黨的問題</p>
<p>一，在抗戰期內依照抗戰建國綱領之規定辦理；在戰爭結束後，依照中央決議，召開國民大會制定憲法實施憲政，中國共產黨當與其他政黨，遵守國家法律，享受同等待遇；</p>
<p>二，中國共產黨，應再表示忠實實行四項諾言。</p>
<p>在中央提示案，面交林祖涵先生之後，並經聲明中共如將以上辦法實行後，則中央對於撤退防護地區之守備部隊，可予考慮，並可恢復該地區與其隣地之商業交通，及中共人員違法被捕者亦可從寬酌予保釋。林先生隨從口袋內取出一函，附有「中國共產黨中央委員會，向中國國民黨中央執行委員會，提出關於解決目前若干急切問題的意見」文件一份，交與我們閱看。其原文如左：</p>
<p>中國共產黨中央委員會向中國國民黨中央執行委員會提出關於解決目前若干急切問題的意見</p>
<p>國共兩黨合作抗戰已歷七年，中共謀國之忠誠，作戰之英勇，執行三民主義，實踐四項諾言，擁護國民政府及蔣介石先生抗戰建國，始終如一，均爲有目所共見；惟目前抗戰形勢，極爲嚴重，日軍繼續進攻，而國內政治情况與國共關係，尙未走上適合抗戰需要之軌道，爲克服目前困難，抵抗日軍進攻，並認眞準備反攻起見，中共方面認爲惟有實行民主，與增强團結一途，爲此目的，中共希望政府方面，解決以下緊急萬分的問題，這些問題，有關於全國政治方面者，有關於兩黨懸案方面者，茲率直臚陳如下：</p>
<p>甲　關於全國政治者</p>
<p>一，請政府寳行民主政治，保證言論，出版，集會，結社，及人身之自由；</p>
<p>二，請政府開放黨禁，承認中共及各抗戰黨派的合法地位，釋放愛國政治犯；</p>
<p>三請政府允許實行名副其實的人民地方自治。</p>
<p>乙　關於兩黨縣案者</p>
<p>一，根據抗戰需要，抗戰成績，及現有軍隊實數，應請政府對中共軍隊，編十六個軍四十七個師，每師一萬人，爲委曲求全計，目前至少給予五個軍十六個師的番號：</p>
<p>二，請政府承認陜甘寗邊區，及華北根據地民選政府爲合法的地方政府，並承認其爲抗戰所需要的各項設施；</p>
<p>三，中共軍隊防地，抗戰期間維現狀，抗戰結束後，另行商定；</p>
<p>四，請政府在物質上，充份接濟十八集團軍及新四軍，自一九四〇年以來，政府即無顆彈片藥分錢粒米之接濟，此種狀况，請速改變；</p>
<p>五，同盟國援助中國之武器，彈藥，藥品，應請政府公平分配於中國各軍，十八集團軍及新四軍，應獲得其應得之一份；</p>
<p>六，請政府飭令軍政機關，取消對於陜甘寗邊區及各根據地的軍事封鎖與經濟封鎖；</p>
<p>七，請政府飭令軍事機關，停止對於華中新四軍，及廣東游擊隊之軍事攻擊；</p>
<p>八，請政府飭令黨政機關，釋放各地被捕人員，例如皖南事變時，被俘的新四軍官兵葉挺等，廣東的廖承志，張文彬等，新疆的徐杰，徐夢秋，毛澤民，楊之華，潘卻等，四川的羅世文，車輛先，李椿，張少明等，湖北的何彬等，浙江的劉英，西安宣俠父，石作祥，李玉海，陳元英，趙祥等，此等人員均係愛國志士，請予恢復目由；</p>
<p>九，請政府允許中共在全國各地辦黨辦報，中共亦允許國民黨在陜甘寗邊區，及各民主邊區辦黨辦報。</p>
<p>以上各條僅舉其主要者，中共方面誠懇希望我國民政府，予以合理與儘可能迅速之解決。若我國共兩黨不但繼續合作，而且能對國內政治予以刷新，黨派關係予以改進，則不特於目前時局大有裨益，且於明年配合同盟國舉行大規模之反攻，放出堅固之曙光，願我政府實利圖之。</p>
<p>中共中央代表林祖涵民國三十三年六月四日此時我們曾對林祖涵先生說：上次於五月二十二日先生提出之二十項，因內容與在西安所表示的意見出入甚大，未便接受，當經先生收回。此次所提出之十二項，項目雖較前减少，但內容並未變更，本不能接受，惟不欲過拂先生的意思，僅允留下，但不能轉呈。當時林先生亦說留在你們兩位處參考亦好。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>到了六月六日，我們接到林祖涵先生的來信，對於中央提示案，提出兩點聲明：第一，認爲提示案與中共六月四日正式提出的意見，相距甚遠，除將提示案報吿中共中央請示外，並請將中共提出的十二條，轉請中央作合理解決。第二，對於提示案開頭所說的：「以林代表祖涵在西安表示之意兇爲基礎」一語，認爲與經過事實不符，他認爲西安的紀錄，是「最後共同作成的初步意見」，他同意「的定各自向其中央請示，再作最後決定」，因此他還是希望中央考慮中共最近正式提出的意見。我們當即在六月八日，回林先生一封信，就他所聲明的兩點，提出答復：第一，林先生六月五日交來的函件，因爲前後出入太大，曾經聲明未便轉呈。林先生最後說：「就留在你們兩位處參考也好」，所以當時僅允留下，但仍聲明不能轉呈；第二，在西安談話中紀錄下來經過林先生增减修改，另自繕淸再行簽字的意說，我們回來以後。已經轉呈中央，所以中央提示案，就以林先生的意見爲基礎，並且儘量容納了林先生的意見，希望林光生能够完全接受。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>六月十一日，又接到林先生來信，他對我們六月八日的回信，認爲「有兩點甚難理解」：第一，說我們已承認他是中共代表，就不應該不把中共正式提出的意見轉報中央，而只片面要求他個人接受中央提示案，他個人如何能够做主？第二，他承認六月五日面交的中共所提的十二條，誠與西安商談意見，一略有」出入，但中央提示案和西安商談的意見亦有出入，他以爲這種談判過程中的出入雙方都有，不足爲異，他現在已經將中央提示案電吿中共中央，我們就不應該拒絕將中共正式提出的意見，轉呈中央請示。</p>
<p>其實林先生說不能理解的兩點，事實是很顯明的。正因爲林先生是中共的代表，所以他所表示的意見，當然可以作算的。至於中共隨後所提的十二條，內容與林先生的意見大有出入，而且中共對於服從軍令政令的根本觀念，並無表示，只是提出片面的要求，所以我們當時鄭重聲明不能轉呈，是不難理解的。但我們因爲希望問題畢日得到解決，允不願大家因此發生誤解，所以仍將林先生交來的十二條轉呈中央政府。隨率中央指示，以「中央六月五日已以提示案交林代表轉達中共，凡中共意見，中央政府所能容納者，該提示案已儘量容納，希望中共方面接受」。</p>
<p>六月十五日，我們就將中央的指示，函達林先生，並申述此次商談之基本精神，須本統一國家軍令政令之原則，爲改善現狀，增强團結之前提。而中共所提十二條的內容，對於如何實行中央政府的軍令政令，和改善措施整編部隊各點，均未提及。至於整編部隊的數字，在西安時我們說整編部隊可能的數字是三軍八師，現在中央提示案決定爲四軍十師，比較我們所說的數字還增加了兩師，可見中央儘量遷就的意思。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>六月十五日我們回覆了林光生的信以後，經過十幾天，中共方面，對於中央提示案仍無答復，至七月三日，林先生的我們會談，口頭提出，對中央提示案有兩點商量：第一，關於政治問題，希望中央將「民主」尺慮放寬；第二，關於軍隊問題，希望按五軍十六師擴編，同時又說，延安有電報，歡迎你們兩位到延安商談。當時我們就說明：關於民主問題，政府已在採取各種措施，促進民主政治的實施，例如廢止圖書事光强制審查辦法，嚴令後方各省完成縣參議會之設置，及中央即將公佈保障人民身體自由之法令，和其他正在擬議中的很多關於民主的措施，不必列舉。至於軍隊擴編數目的間題，中央正在勵行精兵政策，儘量的緊縮單位，對於中共的要求，已經儘最大限度來容納，如果拿抗戰初期國軍數額和現在增加數量來作一比對，就可以了解中央委曲求全的苦衷。最後我們認爲像這樣談下去，有點像故意拖延，似乎應該將中央提示案作一全面確切的答復，來作具體商討的基礎，不宜再在口頭上空言往返，討價還價，徒增枝節。並表示如在重慶能得到結論之後，我們可以考慮去訪問延安的問題。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>至七月十三日，林先生又來會面，當時他又請中央對他們所提的十二項有所「指示」，而對於中央交給他們的提示案如何答復問題，他並未提及，當時我們以林先生所提各項問題過去多已經加以說明，殊不必再加辯駁，僅答林先生來意已明，我們再另訂期商談而散。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>到了七月二十三日，林先生又來一信、內容仍係問及我們對他所提十二項的意見，是否已請示答復，並請我們到延安去。</p>
<p>七月二十五日，我們再與林先生見面，對於他所提十二貢內列各項問題，在口頭上曾有較詳細之解釋，並吿以中央所提出之提示案，即係中央具體意見，乃中共延久未予答覆，並且我們曾說中共如此態度，很像有意延拖，不願意來解決這個問題的。</p>

<h3>工務局職員　發現舞弊案件　英文泰晤士報刊載</h3>
<p>據本埠英文泰晤士報本月十三日及十五日載稱，上海市公務局近發見重大舞弊案，茲譯誌其內容如下：</p>
<p>在工務局舞弊案中，最爲行人注目之事實，乃爲大西路，虹橋路一帶之樹木，爲人非法砍伐出售，又市立公園之樹木，聞亦有人私自砍伐出售，如中山公園（前兆豐公園）。</p>
<p>按此項公共福利設施，爲上海市民化極大之　用始得吿成者，今遭此摧折，市政最高當局應即設法加以澈查並予制裁。</p>
<p>泰晤士報獲上項消息後，即對市工務局之活動進行調查，據悉工務局之若干職員，因薪水不足維持生活，逐利用其職權，向外收取不法費用。此種情形，不僅工務局爲然，即其他各局，亦有類此情形發生。</p>
<p>非法砍樹　該報更探悉工務局之舞弊案，因其規模之大，必獲有其上級機關之默許或勾通。聞市府秘書處亦有人牽入此項大規模之舞弊案。關於非法砍售樹木一事，工務局之公園課嫌疑最大，該課本屬於路政科，近方改隸於建築科。</p>
<p>當時該課之改隸所屬，當局並未說明其理由，且似極不和理。據聞本年冬季各馬路樹木之修剪，可獲樹柴達八百萬元之鉅。又前述虹橋路大西路一帶被砍售之樹木，達二百棵，以樹柴估價，約値百萬元。</p>
<p>據悉當本市一八兩區合併之際，市府當局曾委令當有經騐之人員，分任公務處各部課領導位置。但就中有二十四封委狀爲他人所「掉包」，致所用均非所委之人。</p>
<p>收取回佣　此辈人對於實際技術並無所知，因此造成今日腐敗狀態。凡該處向外購取材料，必增收百分之二十回佣，此事幾爲公開秘密，凡與該處有往來者均能知之。而該處每月購進材料，約達一千二百萬，故此項回佣極爲可觀。</p>
<p>更甚者，在市府倉庫中所存儲之材料，若由工務處負責人購進，槪照原價計算。例如水泥與鋼版，市價早巳上升千倍，但工務局可以市價千分之以之價格，向市府倉庫批購，然後轉行出售，一轉手間，便可獲利無算。當然，此種非法活動，自需獲得其上司許可。大批市府存貨如水泥，鋼版，煤斤，即在種種藉口下出淸一空。例如舊八區之倉庫，在合併前存貨極爲充足，但目前所有重要物資，如煤，汽車另件，水泥，鋼版，帆布及另件等，均巳一空。</p>
<p>在該局預算項下，近郊區域之建築修理費，原佔重要一部份。每次修理費用總需一千萬左右。惟目前市民很少注意近郊路政及建築情况，市府亦未派員前往視察，因此該處於領得修築款項後，僅單單敷衍了事，將所餘經費，分配於私人聞。例如中山路之修築費，合同爲七百萬元，另由該處供應　油八百萬元。然工作並未照計劃完成，不久仍須修理。</p>
<p>揑名支薪　再者，該局各部課人員之薪水支發，據云有數百名領薪者實際並無其人。修理工作制費用，本極難正確估計，故頗易作偽，各項工程之修理費，至少有百分之二十係出於額外增加。市政府所批准建設之市政紀念亭，現復由該處增加預算百分之四十，總計値二千萬元。</p>
<p>關於領取建築執照，不論有否違章，均須付納「小費」後始可領得，付納小費後，即未領得執照，亦可動工，至於建築物質安全性，根本不加考慮。每一建築物所須付之「小費」，約在十萬至二十萬元間。</p>
<p>前爲防止未領有執照之小販在馬路里衖私行設　起見。曾進行調查，發見約有二萬之私販存在。但自市政合併後，並未加以禁止。反假調查名義，私刑收取小費。每　視其規模大小，收費自數千數萬不等。</p>
<p>勒索小費　關於建築合同及工程等之登記，極少調查其資格，而登記費則爲六千元及七千元左右。又在保障工業安全之名義下，該局時向各廠發出警吿，冀使在各廠請求檢查時勒索小費。其收費標準，視馬達與汽鍋之大小而定，一經交付小費，安全問題，根本不受重視。</p>
<p>該局所收之納賄，用四六分拆方式，分配於上下職員間。該局之監印　，在契約合同打印之前，亦例向請求人需索小費一千元至一萬元。</p>
<p>現新市政當局業已就任，據聞對此種舞弊案即將進行調查，不久將來，定可水落石出云。（譯錄泰晤士報）</p>
<h3>劉宣傳處長　談施政方針</h3>
<p>市宣傳處長劉德煊氏蒞任伊始，頃發表施政方針如次：「本人此次奉命忝主本市宣傳處，深慮職責重大，才力不勝，然旣奉命而來，今後在宣傳方面，當本旣定國策，努力邁進，在工作上決秉周市長羅秘書長意旨，逐步推進。對於喜劇審查及文化登記，當依照法規辦理，不徇情，不枉法，本處工作同志均有固定生活費，倘有彼此賄賂情事，一經查實，當呈請上峯核辦。總之，上海情形複雜，加之誘惑力極大，倘不振奮人心，實不能挽回頹風，成敗毀譽，固不計及，好在本市文化　宿報業先進，均係老友，甚望隨時加之指導，予以恊助，公私厚幸」。</p>

<h3>警員破案迅速　當局授獎金</h3>
<p>是警察局司法處長李時雨，因查老閘泰山兩分局管轄區內，先後發生「索　無着積忿行兇」，及「勒斃妻室親子」，兇殺慘案，而前案兇手吳全海及後案兇犯李子英，均能於二十四小時內由各該分局司法股嚴密緝獲，殊甚嘉獎，故於防犯經費項內，提撥十五萬元作獎金，以資獎勵。其中老閘區之血案比較情形複雜，查緝費時，故撥十萬元，已於昨日由李處長（副處長　賢二郞代）偕同防犯科長楊雄時，至各該分局授獎，而由各該司法股主任鄧肇金，劉俊卿授獎，並當即召集全體職員訓話。</p>

<h3>甲組足球聯賽最近形勢　葡商居首席　聯誼僑聯各有厚望</h3>
<p>本屆足球聯賽甲組，賽程已去大半，昨據足聯會公布該組最近形勢如下：</p>
<p>查上列形勢，葡商就戰九勝，爲僅保常勝之一隊，蓋僑聯敗於聯誼，而聯誼則於上週與德商握手言和也，東華巳二度失利，前途暗淡，錦標一席以葡商呼聲最高，僑聯與聯誼亦尙有希望，此後尙四塲，有關本屆王座之得失，即聯誼對葡商，東華對僑聯，聯誼對東華及葡商對僑聯是也。葡僑之仗，定本星期日上午十時在逸園交綏，此幕大戰，値得注意，葡商如勝僅餘對聯誼一關，否則僑聯與葡隊並駕齊驅，將另有一番局面也，殿軍必爲三省或俄體二者之一，蓋二隊俱每戰均北，尙保持不勝之局。</p>
<h3>籃球聯賽　華聯克仁餘　女組益康勝聯誼</h3>

<h3>渝共談判破裂經過（自第二版轉來）</h3>
<p>我們在這個期間，曾繼續研究這個問題，並且考慮在上一次口頭答覆之後，應該再有一個書生見面一次，曾說明我們預備將上一次口頭答覆的意見，做成一個書面答覆，同時並等你們對中央提示案有確實答覆之後，那時我們再考慮進一步商談，和是否去延安的問題。在此次談話之後，於八月十日根據前意寫成一信，送給林先生，其要旨如左：</p>
<p>「從五月三日在西安晤面起，已逾三月，自六月五日面交中央提示案之後，亦兩月餘，迄未得中共切實答覆，殊出初料之外，此次政府提示案之內容，不但對去歲林彪師長所請求各欵，幾已全部容納，即對先生在西安表示之意見，亦已大部容納，中共旣表示擁護團結與統一，請即促其接受。</p>
<p>關於中共之十二條意見，第一至第三條，政府提示案中，已凱切申示：在抗戰期內勵行中共及一切黨派所接受之抗戰建國綱領；在抗戰結束後一年內實行憲政，予各黨派以同等地位。意義明豁而具體，若於申示以外，標舉若干毫無邊際之抽象文句，徒爲異日增加糾紛。現在中央政府已定之政策，在依抗戰進展，勝利接近與夫社會安定，逐漸擴大人民自由範圍，促進地方自治；一方面政府希望中共接受提示案後，隨時提出關於勵行抗戰建國綱領之意見，並積極參加參攷會及憲政實施協進會之工作，期彼此觀點漸趨一致，國家眞正統一團結，可以實現，此爲政治解決之根本意義。</p>
<p>十二條中關於軍隊編制，數額，軍隊駐地，軍餉，軍械者四條：十八集團軍原來編爲三師，現在允許擴編爲四軍十師，在政府勵行精兵政策裁減單位之時期中，自屬委曲求全之至。關於軍隊駐地，提示案一面指示集中使用之原則，一面規定在集中前整訓指揮系統，實已面面兼到。至於軍餉，則已規定國軍享受一律待遇；軍械則政府當隨時依需要與所負之任務爲合理之分配。</p>
<p>十二條中要求政府承認「陜甘寗邊區」及「華北根據地民選政府」之一條，在陜北邊區問題，政府提示案中已提出十分寬大之辦法，至其他任何地區之行政機構，自當依照提示後，由各該管省政府接管，以免紛歧。</p>
<p>其他尙有若干要求，或則與事實不符，或則與事理不合，均已向先生口頭說明，茲不贅述。」</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>以後接到林祖涵先生八月三十日來函，以奉中共之命答覆我們八月十日的去信，大意是：</p>
<p>「一，認爲我們八月十日的信上，含有責備中共無理拖延的意思，係完全不合事實與錯誤的見解。因爲政府提示案與中共所提之書面十二條與口頭八條，原則上相距太遠，並舉出（一）提示案對於實行民主政治，承認各黨合法，釋放政治犯等一字未提；（二）編軍的數目和編制外軍隊的取消及軍隊集中使用；（三）祇要求邊區政府實行中央法令，而不提實行三民主義，不承認現行各項設施與法令；（四）取銷抗戰根據地的人民選出之民主政府等，認爲距離太遠的事實。二，認爲根本解決問題的障礙，由於中央政府與中共及「全國廣大人民」的觀點，有着很大的距離，因爲政府始終不願意立即實行三民主義和民主制度。三，希望中央政府在解決全國政治問題與國共關係問題，應把整個國家民族的利益放在第一，應從有利全國團結抗戰，有利促進民主的觀點出發。後面又重複提到上面已經列舉過的「政治問題」，「軍隊問題」和「邊區」及「華中，華南，華北各根據地」等問題，重申第一項各點所持之態度，同時張大了許多範圍。四，申述中共始終忠實執行四項諾言，忠實實行三民主義，堅持民主團結與政治解決的方針，證明中共不願使談判破裂。」</p>
<p>我們看了林先生八月三十日來信之後，使我們感覺詫異。其中所舉各項情形的眞實性，究竟到如何程度？想各位都會有一個很確當的判斷，用不着多加說明。我們是奉命商談具體問題，從去西安到現在，已經把問題愈談愈遠了，所以遠的原因，諸位從以上的文件里，可以看得出。我們不能不引爲惋惜。但是我們並不絕望，爲了使中央方面，能夠確實的明瞭我們的意思，所以隨後就覆了一信，大意是：</p>
<p>「申述中央政府命令我們與先生商談，在求全國之眞正統一，亦即求中共切實履行其四項諾言（見附註），切實擁護全國政權之統一，如先生所說中共始終執行四項諾言，則中共對各地國軍何致有許多侵犯的事實？中央何致今日尙須命我們與先生商談服從軍令政令等問題？</p>
<p>中央命我們與先生商談統一，原爲未來之憲政與整個三民主義的實施，樹立强固之基礎。關于民主政治及黨派問題，中央提示案已有剴切條文，我們八月十日函內復有詳細的申說，何以說是「一字不提」？來函所說的中共在邊區及各抗戰根據地澈底實行了三民主義，又說在中共的一切區域內，一切人民和團體，均享有一切自由和權利，但有許多事實，迫着我們否認。即如民主與自由，國父遺敎，欲以五權分立爲民主的正軌與人民自由的保障，中共區域內可有司法權監察權獨立的事實？中共區域內的人民乃至共產黨員，可有言論自由，身體自由的保障？我們前函希望對于民主自由等問題，勿提出毫無漫際的抽象要求，並請中共隨時與中央政府，思參政會以及憲政實施協進會等切實商討各項問題的解決辦法，不惟至當，自應必要。</p>
<p>說明來函所提種種問題，早已一一奉答，其中一點，即中央提示案對於去歲林彪師長和最近先生在西安所提意見，已經「大部容納」，確係絕對眞實，但先生依然强調「距離太遠」，可是距離遠的原因，不外是因中共的要求與時俱增，先生在西安所提的較去年林師長所提的多，中共所提的十二條又較先生在西安所提的多，此次來函又於十二條以外，加上所謂「口頭八條」，要求旣與時俱增，距離乃不能不遠。例如陜北邊區和所謂「其他根據地」問題，林師長所提爲「陜北邊區照原地區改爲行政區，其他各地區，另行改組，實行中央法令」；先生在西安簽字的文件，並未列入「其他根據地」；中共所提十二條中，則要求承認「陜甘寧邊區及華北根據地民選政府」；先生來函則更以「陜甘寧邊區政府及華北華中華南各根據地民選政府，」的承認爲言，此種逐漸變化，逐漸擴大要求的情形下，倘商談不能接近，其責任究在誰方？</p>
<p>說明中央政府與國民黨決不將一黨一派的利益，置於國家民族利益之上，切望中共能夠同守此旨。</p>
<p>最後說到只要於事實有益，我們赴延安一節，亦所樂從，茲問中共能否派負責代表來重慶解決問題，並派何人代表偕返重慶。</p>
<p>附註　二十六年九月中共申述之四項諾言</p>
<p>（一）中山先生的三民主義，爲今日中國之必需，本黨願爲其澈底的實現而奮鬥。</p>
<p>（二）取消一切推翻中國國民黨政權的暴動政策及赤癈運動，停止以暴力沒收地主土地的政策。</p>
<p>（三）取消現在的蘇維埃政府，實行民權政治，以期全國政權之統一。</p>
<p>（四）取消紅軍名義及番號，改編爲國民革命軍，受國民政府軍事委員會之統轄。</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>這一次商談的經過和來往有關文件的重要內容，一一報告如上。今日中共問題，爲了國家統一團結及爭取抗戰勝利，建國成功，全國的人民，都熱切希望早日得到合理的解決，我們受中央政府之命，負着商談的任務，當然更抱着最大的熱忱和希望。中央政府所要求的，祇爲革命與政令的統一，必須如此，乃能有確實的團結，乃能舉國軍民一致，更必須如此，乃能有利於抗戰建國。在這一個大前提之下，中央政府無不根據事害，委曲求全，儘是容納中共的意見，這在中央提示案上，都可以明白看出來。至於民主自由問題，中央政府一向重在實事求是，實在去做，不欲徒托空言，在抗戰建國綱領原則之下，如開放言論，保障人民自由，擴大民意機關職權，都在着着進行，今後自仍本此方針，繼續致力，使戰爭結束之後，能夠順利推行憲政，那時候黨的問題，自然可以解決。現在中共方面，雖然還沒有接受中央提示案和實行遵守國家軍令政治的表示，但是我們希望中共當能本諸團結抗戰的眞義，以事實和行動來踐履諾言，實現國家眞正的統一。中央政府決不變更政治解決的方針，而且竭誠期待中共修正所所持的觀點，早日解決這一問題，以慰全國同胞的期望。因知諸位先生對這一問題之實切，特來報告關於本問題商談經過，並鄭重說明中央政府的態度和願望，還請諸位先生賜敎。</p>

<p>女白雪艇先生動鑒：敝黨中央關於解決目前急切問題之意見廿條，自上月二十二日面交兩先生未被接受後，弟即向延安方面報告，茲奉敝黨中央覆電，爲了尊重兩先生意見以利談判，以示我方希望解決問題之誠意，將二十條改爲十二條，而把那些小的問題，改爲備忘錄，茲特抄上一份，請轉呈貴黨總裁，曁貴黨中央商覆爲荷，專此，敬頌</p>
<p>林祖涵謹啓。卅三年六月四日。</p>
<p>中國共產黨中央委員會向　中國國民黨中央執行委員會提出關於解決目前若干急切問題的意見：</p>
<p>國共兩黨合作抗戰，已歷七年，中共謀國之忠誠，作戰之英勇，執行三民主義，實踐四項諾言，擁護國民政府及蔣介石先生抗戰建國，始終如一，均爲有目所共見，惟目前抗戰形勢，極爲嚴重，日軍繼續進攻，而國內政治情況，與國共關係，尙未走上適合抗戰需要之軌道，爲克服目前困難，並認眞準備反攻起見，中共方面認爲惟有實行民主與增强團結一途。爲此目的，中共希望政府方面解決以下緊急萬分的問題，這些問題在關於全國政治方面者，有關於兩黨懸案方面者，茲率直臚陳如下：</p>
<p>甲，關於全國政治者</p>
<p>一，請政府實行民主政治，保證議論，出版，集會，結社及人身之自由。</p>
<p>二，請政府開放黨禁，承認中共及各抗戰黨派的合法地位，釋放愛國政治犯。</p>
<p>三，請政府實行允許名副其實的人民地方自治。</p>
<p>乙，關於兩黨懸案者</p>
<p>一，根據抗戰需要，抗戰成績，及現有軍隊實數，應請政府對中共軍隊編十六個軍四十七師，每師一萬人。爲委曲求全計，目前至少給予五個軍十六個師的番號。</p>
<p>二，請政府承認陜甘寗邊區及華北根據地民選抗戰政府爲合法的地方政府，並承認其爲抗戰所需要的軍各設施。</p>
<p>三，中共軍隊防地，抗戰期間維持現狀，抗戰結束後另行商定。</p>
<p>四，請政府在物質上充分接濟十八集團軍及新四軍，自一九四〇年以來，政府無顆彈片藥分錢粒米之接濟，此種狀況，請速改變。</p>
<p>五，同盟國援助中國之武器，彈藥，藥品，應請政府公平分配於中國各軍，十八集團軍及新四軍應獲得其應得之一份。</p>
<p>六，請政府飭令軍政機關取消對於陜甘寗邊區及各根據地的軍事封鎖，與經濟封鎖。</p>
<p>七，請政府飭令軍事機關停止關於華中新西軍及廣東游擊隊的軍事攻擊。</p>
<p>八，請政府飭令黨政機關釋放各地被捕人員。例如：皖南事變時被俘的新四軍官兵葉挺等，廣東的廖承志，張文彬等，新疆的徐杰，徐夢秋，毛澤民，楊之華，潘郤等，四川的羅世文，車燭先，李椿，張少明等，湖北的何彬等，浙江的劉英，西安的宣俠父，石作祥，李玉海，陳元英，趙祥等。此等人員均係愛國志士，請予恢復自由。</p>
<p>九，請政府允許中共在全國各地辦黨辦報，中共亦允許國民黨在陜甘寗邊區及各民主邊區辦黨辦報。</p>
<p>以上各條，僅舉其主要　，中共方面誠懇希望我國民政府予以合理與儘量能迅速之解決，誠以日軍正大舉進攻威脅抗戰陣綫，若我國共兩黨不但繼續合作，而且能對國民政治予以刷新，黨派關係予以改進，則不特於目前時局大有裨益，且於明年配合同盟國舉行大規模之反攻，放出堅固之曙光，願我政府實利圖之。中共中央代表林祖涵。民國三十三年六月四日。</p>
<p>五，王世杰張治中對中共十二條之復函　三十三年八月十日</p>
<p>伯渠先生勛鑒：自五月三日，弟等與先生晤見於西安，往復商談，迄今已逾三月。自六月五日，弟等以中央政府提示案面交先生，爲時已兩月有餘，迄今尙未接到中共方面之切實答復。此等情形，殊出弟等初料之外，政府在提出提示案以前，特令弟等先赴西安，與先生晤談至兩週之久，藉以充分聆悉中共方面之意見，用意已極愼重。政府提示案之內容，不但對於去歲中共代表林彪師長所請求諸款，幾已全部容納，即對先生最近在西安所表示意見，亦已大部容納，凡斯事實，只須將有關文件，略一比照分析，即可瞭然。竊意政治解決，旣爲中共所表示贊同，團結與統一，亦爲中共所宣言擁護。弟等今茲實不能不敦請先生向中共主持諸公剴切敷陳，促其接受政府提示案，並迅予見復。至六月五日先生交來之中共方面十二條意見，弟等於六月十五日業將政府指示及弟等觀感以書面送達左右，茲因先生一再敦促，弟等爲更詳盡之答復，因將政府意旨再爲先生詳言之：</p>
<p>一，十二條意見中之第一第二第三三條，涉及實行民主政治，保證自由，承認中共合法地位與地方自治諸事。對於此類問題，政府提示案中，業已剴切申示兩點，即在抗戰內勵行中共曁一切黨派所已接受之抗戰建國綱領，在抗戰結束後一年以內，實行憲政，予各黨派以同等地位，此種申示，意義較爲明豁，亦較爲具體。倘中共欲於此種申示之外，更標舉若干毫無邊際之抽象文句，如「實行民主政治」·「保證自由」等等，於事實究竟有何裨益？徒爲異日增加糾紛而已。蓋「民主政治」云云，其他云云，中共過去或今日之所信，固未必與國民黨黨員乃至一般民主主義者之所信爲一事也。茲願與先生告者，計有兩事：（一）中央政府之旣定政策，在依抗戰之進展，勝利之接近，與夫社會之安定，而逐漸廣大人民自由之範圍，促進地方之自治。（二）政府希望中共於接受提示案後，隨時提出關於勵行抗戰建國綱領之意見，並積極參加參政會及憲政實施協進會工作。誠能如是，彼此之觀點，當不能漸趨一致，國家之眞正統一與團結，庶幾可以實現。政治解決云者，其根本意義，亦即在此。</p>
<p>二，十二條意見中，涉及軍隊編制數項，軍隊駐地，軍餉，軍械者四條，十八集團軍過去核定編制原爲四萬五千人。政府提示案允許編爲四軍十師，確屬從寬核定。蓋帶兵官自行擴編軍隊，其事原不可爲訓，且政府正勵行精兵政策，一般軍隊均在裁撤單位。於此時期，獨允十八集團軍擴編爲四軍十師，自屬委曲求全之至。關於軍隊駐地，政府亦已考慮至再，提示案一面指示集中使用之原則，一面規定在未集中前受所在地戰區司令長官之整訓指揮，原則與事實已兼顧，倘如中共所提意見，抗戰全期間內，軍隊防地，槪維現狀，試問中央何以計劃反攻，或指揮作戰？至於軍餉，提示案中業已允許第十八集團軍享受與一般國軍相同之待遇。軍械之供給，政府當隨時視反攻之需要，與各軍所負之任務，爲公允與合理之分配。</p>
<p>三，十二條意見中，列有一條，要求政府承認「陜甘寗邊區」，以及「華北根據地之民選政府」。陜北邊區問題，政府願予考慮，並已於提示案中提出十分寬大之辦法，藉以容納中共之意見。至其他任何地區之行政機構，自當依照提示之指示，由各該管省政府接管，以免分歧，而杜流弊。</p>
<p>四，十二條意見中尙有若干要求或則與事實不符，（如對中央在陜北報等事，設定某某條件）弟等已向先生口頭說明，茲不贅述。至於十二條意見中，所解除陜邊之「軍事封鎖」，曁釋放若干人犯兩項要求，弟等已向先生口頭聲明，俟此次商談獲有切實結果，當予考慮。</p>
<p>綜之，政府對於中共方面之意見，實已儘可能範圍予以容納。至於政府之根本意願，在則軍令政令之貫澈與統一。中共提出十二條意見書時，旣未將有從中央軍令與政令一層列入條款之內，即該書面之引言，亦未將中共對於此一根本問題之今後態度爲剴切鮮明之表示。弟等當時不敢轉陳者，大半以此。嗣因先生口頭聲明，謂中共方面對於服從軍令政令，決無問題，弟等乃敢以先生口頭聲明與十二條書面一併轉陳政府。此又弟等所願附帶的鄭重聲明者也。專此佈達，諸希惠察，並頌時祺。　弟王世杰張治中敬啓三十三年八月十日</p>
<p>六，林祖涵覆函　卅三年八月卅日</p>
<p>雪艇文白先生勛鑒：八月十日來函，對敝黨十二條意見所作之答覆，於收到之後，即轉電延安，以往返電碼多有訛誤，校正費去一些時間。茲將敝黨中央命弟奉覆的意見，轉告如後，敬請再轉達蔣主席及貴黨中央。</p>
<p>（一）來函說：政府提示案已交給中共兩月餘，「尙未得中共方面之切實答覆」，殊出先生等「意料之外」，並說道這個提示案，已能「大部容納」中共之意見，似含有責備我方無理拖延之意。應該聲明，這是完全不合事實，與錯誤的見解。因爲弟已在屢次會談中，表示政府提示案，與我黨提出的書面十二條，及口頭八條，在原則上相距太遠，無法接受。譬如在政府提示案中：（一）關於我方所迫切要求解決的實行民主政治，承認各黨合法，釋放愛國政治犯，釋放葉挺等被捕人員等項，一字未提。（二）編軍數目，只承認四個軍十個師，且不顧在需要，及敵後游擊區戰爭環境，要將十個師以外數十萬正在抗戰的軍隊「限期取消」，并要將十個師「集中使用」。（三）對邊區政府只要求實行國民黨中央政府之法令，不提實行三民主義，不承認爲抗戰所需要，並且已經實行大覓成效的現行各項民主設施與民主法令。（四）對所有各根據地人民選舉的各民主政府，要求取消。由於兩黨意見距離如此之違，但敝黨中央，仍不願談判停頓與破裂，曾命弟邀請兩先生去延安商變，並要弟回延報告談判經過，以求獲得繼續商談之途徑，使問題終能在有利抗戰團結，有利促進民主的原則下，得到合理解決。兩先生對延安之行，已稱在請示中，弟固望能早日實現也。</p>
<p>（二）國共兩黨關於全國政治問題，及兩黨關係問題之談判，並非自這次弟與兩先生談判開始。遠自西安事變和平解決以來，八年之間，敝黨曾不斷向國民黨建議，只有立即實行民主，實行孫中山先生在國民黨第一次全國代表大會所提出的革命的三民主義，才能增强團結抗戰的力量，只有循民主途徑，才能公平合進的解決國共關係，解決國內其他一切政治問題。我們擁護統一，是擁護建立在民主基礎上的統一，我們擁擠蔣委員長與國民政府，是要求他堅決抗戰，與實行三民主義。這不僅是共產澡一黨的要求，而且是全國百分之九十九的廣大人民的要求。爲了求得國民黨中央政府能夠接受敝黨的建議，接受全國廣大人民的要求，敝黨於民國二十六年九月二十二日的宣言，曾提出了保證實行四項諾言。八年來這四項諾言，我們早已完全實踐了，而且至今信守未渝，這是有充分事實可以證明的。今年三月十二日我黨周恩來同志在延安孫中山先生逝世十九週年紀念大會的演說中，已經詳細的說到了這點，可以參考。八年來敝黨中央，又不斷派弟與周恩來，董必武，林彪諸同志，耐心的向國民黨中央政府請求解決全國政治問題，與國共關係問題，周董兩同志駐渝已有數年，始終並未得到結果，究竟根本解決的問題的障碍在那裏呢？不能不指出是由於國民黨中央政府諸公的觀點，和我們及全國廣大人民的觀點，有着很大的距離，政府負責諸公，始終不願意立即實行孫中山先生的三民主義，及足以團結全國各黨派各階層作戰力量的民主制度。這就是現時雙方談判所以相距甚遠的眞正原因。</p>
<p>（三）我們希望國黨中央政府，在解決全國政府問題與國共關係問題上，應把整個國家民族的利益放在第一，而不把一黨一派一已的私利，放在第一，應從有利全國團結抗戰有利促進民主的觀點出發，而不從維護一黨統治的方針出發，才能使雙方的談判易於接近，才能使一切問題可以得到公平合理的解決。但是政府提示案及兩先生八月十日來信，可惜均不能符合這個期望。比如（一）關於全國政治制度問題，我們所提出的三項要求，（一）請政府實行民主政治與保障人民的言論，出版，集會，結社及人身之自由，（二）承認中其及各愛國黨派的合法地位，釋放愛國政治犯：（三）實行名符其實的地方自治，正是反映今天全國人民最迫切的要求，正是今天爲着團結全國力量認眞準備反攻必須立即實行的措施。如能這樣做，不僅對整個國家民族有利，而且對國民黨有利的。然而兩先生的來信仍堅持「中央政府之旣定政策」，是要在抗戰以後，才實行憲政，實行民主，批評我們所提民主要求爲「毫無邊孫之抽象文句」，認爲於事實無裨益，「徒爲異日增加糾紛」，但照我們的經騐，在我們那樣的艱難困苦的環境中，人民尙能進行普選，討論國事，選舉民主政府，實行地方自治，那有大後方反不能實行民主政治的道理。因此一切問題，都看國民黨有沒有實行民主政治的決心和誠意，如果有，就應該在抗戰期中立即實行憲政，而不是推在抗戰之後。（二）關於中共所領導的四十七萬七千正規軍之編制，防地，與餉械問題，如果從這個軍隊過去作戰的成績，與今天準備反攻的需要來說，他在八年來異常艱苦的戰鬥環境中堅持與發展了三大戰塲（華北，華中，華南）建立起許多强固的作戰根據地，解放了八千八百餘萬的人民，組織了二百二十餘萬的民兵，並成爲將來總反攻的先鋒部隊。爲了準備反攻的需要，政府應當獎勵他，裝備他，增强他，首先就應當全部承認他，才更爲合理。我們在建議書中，請求政府「編爲十六個軍，四十七個師，目前至少給予五個國，十六個師的番號」，是爲着談判更容易接近。關於防地，在作戰期間，維持現狀，及盟國援華物資，請求公平合理分配等，都是適合作戰需要，與無可非難的，而政府提示案的「限期取消」，與「限期集中使用」的辦法，是未能顧計作戰需要，與游擊戰爭環境，兩先生八月十日來信中，强調反對帶兵官「自行擴編軍隊」，與反對軍隊防地維持現狀，責備我們不守軍令的統一，但兩先生恰恰忽視了一件平常人都懂得的眞理，這就是今天我們中國是在抗戰中，如果我們反對在發展人民作戰武裝，或企圖削弱滅這個作戰武裝，以及想使人民作戰武裝從該地離開，這一切都會在客觀上成爲有利於敵人的。（三）今天陜甘寗邊區政府，及華北華中華南各根據地民選政府，其所實行的一切完全是革命的三民主義，堅持抗戰，就是實行民族主義。抗戰政權，完全是民權主義性質的。我們各抗戰根據地，……一切人民和抗日團體，均享有一切自由和權利，並行使直接民權，組織三三制的地方政府，我們又實行勞動互助生產，節約，救災，開荒，减租，减息，精兵簡政，普及敎育擁政愛民，擁軍優抗，減輕人民負担，改善工農生活等政策，更無一不合乎民生主義的原則。由於我們在邊區及各作戰根本地澈底實行三民主義，所以能團結全體人民，克服一切困難，長期堅持抗戰，並可以有力量反攻，像這樣的民主政府，就應當承認他們爲合法的地方政府，就應當給他們以地方自治的權利。像這種的政府，已經實行大見成功的各項民主設施，與民主法令，就應該加以獎勵提倡，推行於全國，這才是眞正奉行孫中山先生的革命的三民主義的國民黨中央政府所應採取的態度，但政府提示案及兩先生八月十日來信，對邊區政府只求實行國民黨中央政府之法令，對各根據地人民選舉的各民主政府，與各種有利作戰的民主設施，則要求取消，也是不利於今天作戰的需要的。</p>
<p>（四）總之，依照目前形勢，要最後戰勝，國共兩黨必須團結，國共之間所存在的問題，必須從速解決，而這種解決，只有國民黨當軸諸公立即實行民主政治，並從民主途徑中公平合理的解決國共關係，才能增强全國團結作戰力量，才能使一切走軌道，才能停止目前敵人進攻，配合將來的全面反攻，也才能建立戰後的國內和平合作，與國際和平合作的關係，我們共產黨人，是以十分熱烈的心情來希望國民黨當軸在民主與團結的基礎上，迅速改變其舊有政府，才能打開目前政治上的僵局，與完成同盟國共同期望的神聖事業。我們這裏絕沒有乘國民黨形勢不利而提出什麼過高的要求，更沒有利用國民黨處境困難而拖延不願解決。（有些無知的人正在如此散佈謠言）凡所主張，都是爲了爭取全民族抗戰勝利，必須實現的東西。我們是在愛護帮助國民黨進步。而不是冷眼坐視國民黨的困難，耿耿忠言，定爲國民黨賢達所鑒察。希望兩先生將上述意見，再向蔣主席及貴黨中央轉陳。時乎不待，望早決策。我們共產黨人始終忠實執行四項諾言，忠實實行三民主義，堅持民主團結與政治解決的方針，以期待國民黨中央政府的回答。敝黨中央所提邀請兩先生赴延安繼續談判一事，不僅表示敝黨不願使談判破裂之誠心，而且想使國民黨中央政府的重要負責人員，親到邊區看看我們是怎樣的忠實地實行四項諾言與澈底實行三民主義。我們在邊區及各根據地的各種建設是很可以爲全國實行民主參考的。想因此使雙方談判更易得到解決，未識兩先生對此已商得政府及貴黨中央同意？盼能早覆，敬頒勛祺。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle in the Northern Luzon Plains: Japanese Forces Break Through the Enemy with a Surprise Attack, Engage Main Force Near Lingayen</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippines Frontline Base, 17th: The enemy, after landing in the Lingayen Gulf area of Luzon Island to welcome Fabian, attempted to advance further and encroach upon the inland. In response, the Japanese ground forces launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage and maintaining control of their positions, preventing the enemy from advancing. Morale is extremely high. On the San Fabian front, after the enemy landed on the 9th, they began to advance eastward on the 10th, invading Bitipolo, with a portion advancing north towards Mabicao. Simultaneously, another enemy force advanced southeast, breaking into Manao. Furthermore, enemy troops newly landed near Damortis and Santo Tomas are currently engaging in fierce battles with Japanese forces within a 10-kilometer radius centered on San Fabian. On the Santo Tomas front, enemy forces numbered over 500 by the evening of the 12th, and approximately 300 in the southern Damortis area. They subsequently attacked Japanese positions, but the Japanese forces bravely launched counterattacks everywhere, achieving significant victories and repelling them. On the Manao front, an enemy battalion, equipped with 15 vehicles, four field guns, and several mortars, is currently advancing from the Cabunaan Heights south of Manao. Several enemy tanks have also appeared in front of Japanese positions, becoming targets for Japanese artillery fire. In the Lingayen Gulf area, the enemy suffered heavy losses from fierce attacks by Japanese air forces and ground artillery. They are currently reinforcing their troops, and it appears that the main force of their tank units landed on the night of the 12th. The enemy forces in that area have moved south from Lingayen and are now in contact with the main force of the Japanese first line.</p>
<h3>Enemy Action Halted Near San Fabian, US Warships Damaged Near Manila</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippines, 17th: According to information received on the evening of the 15th, an enemy force of 30 tanks advanced two kilometers east of Damortis on Luzon Island. The Japanese forces immediately engaged and repelled them. Furthermore, two enemy battalions invaded a high ground four kilometers north of Mabicao and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The battle situation in the Philippines today is as follows: US forces in the plains of Pangasinan in northern Luzon have gradually come into contact with Japanese forces, and the battle of Luzon is reaching a climax. In particular, the actions of the enemy's left flank east of San Fabian have become more active. The enemy troops who newly landed on the 11th have advanced towards Japanese positions along a 35-kilometer front from Damortis to Gatingban. The Japanese and US forces have engaged in fierce battles over the past few days, but the US forces have suffered heavy losses each time, while the Japanese defensive positions have remained unaffected. Furthermore, in the western Lingayen area, the enemy has approached Japanese positions on the left bank of the Agno River, so the fighting in this area is also expected to intensify. Currently, the enemy's central force has not made any significant progress, and the Japanese forces are conserving their strength, waiting for an opportunity. As for the enemy warships visible in Lingayen Gulf, most have been destroyed or are listing. Correspondingly, the enemy mobile force that attacked Taiwan from the eastern sea of Luzon and later invaded southern China with its main force suffered even greater losses.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: The US Sixth Army on Luzon Island, after reaching the Agno River, is showing signs of advancing south. According to frontline reports, US forces are attempting to advance on Tarlac with armored units, but their left flank's advance in the San Fabian area has been halted by Japanese forces. Furthermore, according to an Associated Press dispatch dated the 15th, Japanese artillery fire on the US left flank has caused the US position to waver. Another dispatch stated that over the past two or three nights, Japanese heavy artillery from positions behind Moring has heavily shelled the left flank of the US bridgehead. There were also small-scale engagements west of Lingayen on the 15th.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: The New York Times of the 16th reported on the situation on Luzon Island as follows: There is no doubt that the Japanese forces are gradually concentrating all their forces on Luzon Island. So far, the Japanese attitude has been very cautious. General Yamashita and others are expected to offer fierce resistance north of Manila. It can be predicted that the current US offensive is completely misguided and its advance will encounter extreme difficulties.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: Japanese air forces carried out air raids on US warships near Bataan and Manila Bay on the 15th. According to the US announcement, they suffered some losses in the operation.</p>
<h3>US Carrier-Based Aircraft Formation Attacks Various Places in South China</h3>
<p>Macau Also Bombed</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Mainland Base, 17th: On the 16th, the enemy mobile force in South China again used approximately 370 carrier-based aircraft in total to attack South China, strafing airfields, ships, and other facilities with machine guns. According to reports, starting at 9:00 AM on the 16th, enemy aircraft in formations of several dozen attacked the Hong Kong area. Eighty aircraft attacked the Guangdong area. Starting at 1:00 PM, the enemy again attacked the Xianggang area in formations of several dozen aircraft for approximately two hours. At that time, the Japanese air defense forces immediately engaged, and it has now been confirmed that eight aircraft were shot down. Furthermore, among the enemy aircraft that attacked in the morning, more than 20 illegally violated the neutral Portuguese territory of Macau, strafing it with machine guns.</p>
<h3>General Arima Promoted, Exemplifying Traditional Spirit</h3>
<p>Simultaneously Announced by the Japanese Naval Ministry</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese Naval Ministry and the Bureau of Decorations announced at midnight on the 16th that Lieutenant General Arima, who as Air Force Commander took the lead and boldly attacked enemy ships with kamikaze tactics when the enemy mobile force attempted to land on Leyte Island and appeared in the eastern sea of the Philippines last October, has been specially ordered to be promoted. The results achieved at that time were the sinking of one enemy aircraft carrier, the destruction of two aircraft carriers, causing them to catch fire, and the destruction of one cruiser. Judging from the above results, it can be seen that the true spirit of naval commanders taking the lead has been fully demonstrated. Therefore, the entire army should follow the example of Lieutenant General Arima, continue to be loyal and fight for the country with the spirit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor and Acting Chairman Chen Exchange Letters, Sino-Japanese Relations Become Even Closer</h3>

Acting Chairman Chen personally sent a reply on the 17th, expressing his gratitude. The full text of both letters is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from His Majesty the Japanese Emperor</p>
<p>The Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire respectfully addresses His Excellency the Acting Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China: To celebrate the increasingly close friendship between our two countries and to express our sincere friendship, I have humbly sent Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to your country, to present Your Excellency with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, as a concrete symbol of the friendship I hold.

<p>Reply from Acting Chairman Chen</p>
<p>The Acting Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China, writes to His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire. I have just received Your Gracious Letter, along with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers from your esteemed country, presented in person by His Excellency Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to our country, symbolizing the growing closeness of friendship between our two countries. I am immensely grateful upon receiving it. I take this opportunity to express my highest respect to Your Majesty, and my everlasting friendship. January 17, Year 34 of the Republic of China, Chen Gongbo, Acting Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen Banquets Ambassador Tani</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, in response to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor's presentation of the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, sent a personal letter of thanks and hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 PM on the 17th for Japanese Ambassador Tani to China, Lieutenant General Maeda, Counselor Ota, Counselor Kishi, Secretary Shimizu, and Secretary Takahashi, and invited Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Governor Lin of Anhui Province, Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department, and Secretary-General Zhou of the Executive Yuan to accompany them.</p>
<p>Japanese Youth Corps Resolves to Fight to the Death to Uphold the National Polity</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Zansho Youth Corps held a general affairs meeting at its hall at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, the fourth anniversary of its founding. More than 20 people attended, including advisor Baron Kikuchi. Regarding the enemy American bombing of the Ise Shrine, the following resolution was made and the meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. The resolution reads as follows: "The enemy's bombing of the Ise Shrine is truly frightening and infuriating. The enemy's intention to destroy the national polity of the Imperial State is obvious. Therefore, we, the people, pledge to fight to the death to uphold the group, thoroughly implement support, hold the heart to destroy the bandits and win, and vow before the gods."</p>
<h3>B-29 Aircraft Damage Statistics</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: US Air Force B-29 aircraft based in Chengdu have bombed northern Kyushu and western Japan ten times since June 12 of last year. Furthermore, enemy B-29 aircraft from the Marianas have bombed Tokyo eleven times since November 24, continuously conducting a war of nerves against the vicinity of Tokyo and Zhongcha. B-29 aircraft are purely designed for air raids on the Japanese mainland, but the distance of 2,200 kilometers from Chengdu to Fukuoka and 2,280 kilometers from Saipan to Tokyo places limitations on their activities. Furthermore, the activity of the Japanese air defense forces poses a greater threat to enemy attacks. Judging from the eleven B-29 attacks, the total number of aircraft was 1,250, of which 178 were shot down by Japanese forces and 146 were damaged, with a shooting down rate of 14% and a damage rate of 19%. Among the 178 shot down, 17 were due to ramming. From this, one can imagine the severity of the interception. The destruction of B-29 aircraft can turn their production cost of 650,000 US dollars and 70,000 hours of labor into vapor. At least 12 airmen are killed. Therefore, it can be calculated that the enemy has lost 115.7 million US dollars and 2,136 airmen on the Japanese mainland. In addition, the Japanese Air Force has attacked enemy bases in the Marianas, Chengdu, and Calcutta several times, causing a total of 181 enemy aircraft to be damaged and burned. Furthermore, 11 aircraft have been shot down in Manchuria. The number of aircraft destroyed on the ground and in the air or requiring major repairs since June 16 of last year has reached at least 540 in seven months. Many B-29s have been removed from the command of the enemy's operational headquarters.</p>
<h3>Arnold's Talk</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th: According to a Washington dispatch, US Army Air Corps Secretary Arnold made the following statement on the night of the 13th regarding the war against Japan: The bombing of Japan by B-29s in the past few weeks is only the beginning. More difficult and bitter battles will be encountered in the future. Furthermore, Japan has obtained abundant resources in the Pacific region and is actively developing its industry and agriculture, and is almost self-sufficient, and its scale is three times that of Germany. At the same time, the industrial organization has now been dispersed, so the US Air Force is preparing to bomb it.</p>
<h3>15 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raid on Burmese Territory, US-Chongqing Forces West of Lashio Damaged</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: On the afternoon of the 15th, a Japanese fighter squadron intercepted six enemy P-47 aircraft that attempted to come to attack, shooting down one and damaging two. Two Japanese aircraft did not return. Furthermore, on the same day, Japanese ground forces' anti-aircraft fire shot down two and damaged two enemy P-47 and Mosquito aircraft formations.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Burma Frontline Base, 17th: Enemy aircraft are still extremely persistent in their attacks on Japanese airfields. On the 13th, 20 enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese air base in Meiktila, central Burma. Japanese forces shot down two and damaged three with ground fire. On the 15th, three enemy aircraft came to attack the airfield again. Japanese fighter aircraft intercepted and shot down two and damaged one. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Northern Burma Frontline, 17th: US-Chongqing forces in northern Burma moved south from Bhamo, echoing the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, attempting to open up the connection between the Ledo Road and the Yunnan-Burma Road. In the west of Lashio, they moved at a place 19 kilometers away and suffered heavy damage after being bravely countered by Japanese forces. From January 1 to January 11, Japanese suicide squads killed 270 Chongqing soldiers and captured one rocket launcher and a large amount of military uniforms and ammunition. In the counterattack against the Yunnan Expeditionary Force in early January, countless Chongqing soldiers were killed and countless guns and ammunition were captured.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Wuhan Again, Counterattack Launched, Approximately 30 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: On the afternoon of the 14th, approximately 90 US Chongqing-based Air Force P-40, P-47, P-51, and B-29 aircraft attacked the Wuhan area again, blindly dropping bombs on the urban area. Japanese fighter squadrons and ground artillery engaged the enemy aircraft in a counterattack for four hours, shooting down approximately 30 enemy aircraft. Five Japanese aircraft self-destructed. Damage to military facilities was extremely light. The details of the results are as follows: (1) In aerial combat, 7 P-47s and 5 P-51s were shot down, and 2 P-47s and 5 P-51s were damaged. (2) Ground artillery shot down 3 P-47s and 3 P-40s (2 unconfirmed), and 2 P-51s, and damaged 2 P-47s and 2 P-51s (1 unconfirmed).</p>
<h3>Handover Ceremony Held Yesterday Between New and Old Propaganda Ministers, Minister Zhao Encourages Staff to Continue Efforts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The handover ceremony between the new and old Propaganda Ministers was held at 10:00 AM on the 17th. All new and old staff members of the Ministry participated in the ceremony. First, the outgoing Minister Lin transferred the seal to the receiving Minister Zhao. Minister Lin then gave instructions to the old staff, encouraging all members to work hard to promote the propaganda cause under the leadership of the new director, and introduced the beginning and end of the new Minister Zhao's work in the propaganda department for peace. Before the return to the capital, when Zhao established a propaganda committee in Shanghai, he was responsible for propaganda. Later, the reprinting of the China Daily was also due to Zhao's guidance. After the speech, the new Minister Zhao gave instructions, expressing his deep admiration for the achievements of Minister Lin's leadership of the Propaganda Department in the past, and the hard work and endurance of all members of the Ministry in their efforts in the propaganda cause. He hoped that all members would continue their efforts in the same spirit. The members were very excited after listening to the instructions. Finally, Minister Zhao introduced the new Deputy Minister Sun Lifu to meet with the new and old staff members.</p>
<p>Minister Zhao's Talk</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: After formally taking office at the Ministry on the morning of the 17th, the new Propaganda Minister Zhao Zunyue met with the capital's Chinese and foreign press corps at the Ministry's press room at 4:00 PM and gave a speech on taking office as follows:</p>
<p>At this time when the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, on the eve of our country's quest for independence and freedom, all our people should work doubly hard to jointly achieve this goal. I am now ordered to take over the duties of the Minister of Propaganda, and I know deeply the importance of my responsibilities. I can only follow the late Chairman Wang's legacy, the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, and do my best in my position to ensure that public opinion grows day by day, the people's will is fully expressed, and the entire country is united in sincerity, externally to achieve national freedom and independence, and internally to seek national peace and unity.</p>
<p>The propaganda mechanism is an important policy of the country and a pivot for the government to communicate its policies and the people's will. Under the leadership of Minister Lin, it has been well-established and has achieved brilliant results over the years. I will certainly follow the old practices and strive to use it vigorously so as not to fail Minister Lin's achievements. However, since the war is now at its climax and there is a lack of materials, how can we make the effectiveness more highly developed and the materials can be saved to a considerable extent, so as to adapt to the wartime environment and needs? I will discuss this with all parties after taking office to obtain a suitable solution.</p>
<p>Our country's public opinion has made progress in recent decades, and the people's clear opinions have been expressed a lot. The newspaper business has also progressed accordingly. However, since the military uprising, there have been reasons for decline. After the return to the capital, it was able to regain its development due to the government's promotion. The prosperity of the publication of newspapers and magazines in various places can be seen. In the future, how should we strengthen the equipment of various newspapers and fully disclose the local customs so that they can fulfill their mission of improving society, promoting construction, and leading the people to achieve the final victory of the war? This is what I deeply hope to devote myself to.</p>
<p>I have been involved in the news industry for many years, and my comrades and colleagues have always had high expectations. This time I was ordered to be the head of the department, which is like re-engaging in my old business. However, I feel that the responsibility is heavy, and I hope that all parties will continue to urge and cooperate with me in the future so that propaganda and public opinion can be harmoniously integrated, and we can work together to boldly move forward on the path of building a new China. This is what I hope for.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Evacuating the Population and Rectifying Transportation</h3>
<p>It is unavoidable for important wartime cities to be bombed by enemy aircraft. Especially during tense decisive stages, it is expected that the enemy will attempt to disrupt our rear and implement psychological warfare through indiscriminate bombing. Shanghai is an important base in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, so it is also possible that it will become a target for enemy bombing. We are not deliberately creating alarmist statements to sensationalize. We must pay special attention to the possibility of the current environment.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a dense population, and innocent sacrifices are inevitable under indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. Therefore, on the active side, it is necessary to strengthen air defense facilities and improve air defense effectiveness. On the passive side, it is important to understand air defense knowledge to reduce the risk to life. At the same time, those who do not need to stay in Shanghai should evacuate as much as possible to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, the issue of population evacuation in wartime cities is, in principle, beyond discussion.</p>
<p>The public should actively prepare for population evacuation, and the authorities should also plan and deploy as soon as possible. Do not harbor a wait-and-see, lucky, or complacent attitude. Once the situation arises, you will be at a loss and in chaos. In our editorial on December 26 of last year, we raised several points that should be considered for population evacuation. Here, we must first determine the scope of the population to be evacuated, such as unemployed vagrants, charitable organizations such as homes for the elderly and orphanages, high-ranking idlers without fixed occupations, elderly, weak, women, and children in families, and other residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai. Secondly, the authorities should organize an evacuation committee, and the most important task is to arrange the transportation for evacuation back to their hometowns in a thorough and convenient manner. It is necessary to establish contact with transportation agencies such as trains and ships, and to dedicate special cars and ships for evacuating people. For those evacuating to the outskirts of the city, organize walking teams and divide them into walking stations. Provide rest stops along the way to provide care and services, reducing the suffering of the evacuees. Depending on the economic ability of the evacuees, consider offering free or reduced fares. From another perspective, among the current residents of the city, there are quite a few who are willing to evacuate and return to their hometowns. For example, laid-off employees of various agencies, organizations, and businesses, as well as those who feel that life in Shanghai is difficult to maintain, want to take the opportunity to return home. However, due to transportation difficulties, they cannot do so. Train and boat tickets are difficult to obtain, and luggage cannot be carried. There are many demands along the way, and the theft by "black hats" at the station is disgusting, making travelers afraid. Therefore, the availability of transportation is a prerequisite for population evacuation. Evacuees need to carry their belongings with them for use, and no one wants to abandon them. Therefore, while transportation needs to be increased, the service of transportation workers must also be particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Recently, the "car attendants" on the trains—the "black hats"—extort and steal from passengers, acting extremely arrogantly, which is deeply hated by every passenger. If this is not severely cracked down on, not only will population evacuation be impossible, but even ordinary passengers will be afraid, making it a great stain on railway management. "Car attendants" are just attendants on the train, so why are they so arrogant, and why does the railway authorities turn a deaf ear and allow them to be so unscrupulous, damaging the reputation of the railway? It is incomprehensible. If the entire railway management organization cannot manage even the lowest-level attendants, how can it manage the entire railway administration, let alone serve the passengers? In our editorial on January 6, we cited cracking down on extortion by "black hats" as a touchstone for whether official corruption can be eradicated. Is the power of politics not as strong as the power of the "black hats"? We hope that the authorities will thoroughly crack down on the arrogant behavior of the "black hats" within one month. This will not only facilitate the realization of population evacuation but also wash away the stain on railway administration. Currently, the city's police department has added a branch at the North Station to guard the station's order and inspect passengers on trains. We further hope that the extortion behavior of "black hats" will be corrected first.</p>

<h3>Japan-Italy Association to Reopen Regularly, Promoting Strong Political Measures; Government Emphasizes the Preparation of a Sure-Win Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The 86th Japanese Diet will reopen on the 21st. The Japanese government plans to prepare bills and budgets in this Diet. The Prime Minister's policy speech in this Diet has made it clear that the government is determined to implement decisive battle measures and promote national arousal. At the same time, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association attaches great importance to the following points: (1) This Diet should focus on promoting strong political measures and enhancing the morale for the decisive battle. The situation in the Philippines has become increasingly serious, and the rise and fall of Japan will be determined here. At the same time, under the decisive battle system, the implementation of measures for total mobilization is also an urgent task. At present, it is necessary to unite 100 million people into a "whole-body special attack team," organize them, and train them. Therefore, the important task of this Diet should be the promotion of strong political measures. (2) From the above point of view, it can be seen that this Diet under the decisive battle is well-timed for its task to be undertaken. Therefore, if we avoid the government, avoid the people, and stick to our own position, we will ignore the true essence of the Diet convened in this major crisis. (3) The speech in this Diet must be active, and the questions raised by the various committees must be actively and decisively implemented by the government after this Diet. (4) If so, the content of the discussion, on the government's side, attaches more importance to the closer ties between national affairs and command and the preparation of a sure-win situation. At the same time, it also attaches great importance to issues such as the enhancement of national morale, military production, labor transportation, air defense system, and national production. However, looking at the recent trends, it can be seen that the issue of unifying the domestic system is regarded as a problem of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association itself, and the atmosphere of seeking a solution is extremely strong. In the past, regarding this issue, most of the committees advocated the dissolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the internal situation of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was also extremely complicated. Since the entry of President Kobayashi into the cabinet, the government has used the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as a background to reorganize it, in order to unite with the parliament and carry out the operation of strong political measures. Therefore, to the maximum extent, we should make use of this Diet, gain the support of the people, and seize the opportunity to implement decisive battle measures.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented War Launched in Southern Poland; German Army Abandons Kielce</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The fiercest battle on the Eastern Front is in southern Poland. The Soviet First Ukrainian Front crossed the Nida River on a 56-kilometer front line, turning its vanguard northeast to attack Kielce. According to German reports, the city has been abandoned after street fighting. In the triangle between the Vistula and Bug rivers and the Narew River bridgehead, the Soviet army also formed a deep penetration with a considerable advantage in troops. The German reserve army is now counterattacking. There are no major changes in the fighting on the East Prussian border.</p>
<p>Soviet Reserves Deployed to the Front</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: A German military spokesman pointed out yesterday that the German army's brave resistance on the Eastern Front and the heavy losses of the enemy can be proved by the fact that the Soviet commanders have transferred large numbers of reserve troops to the war zone.</p>
<p>Three Objectives of the Winter Offensive</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: The Eastern Front war will be closely watched by the world in the future. The Soviet winter offensive is now underway between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains. The Soviet army has gathered a large number of troops. Stalin's purpose is not only to break into the Upper Silesian industrial area, but also to defeat the strong German positions in the Warsaw area, or to carry out a large-scale pincer attack on East Prussia, in order to determine the outcome of this war. The Soviet army's winter offensive has the above three objectives, and it is doing its best to defeat the German army on the Eastern Front in one fell swoop. But the question now is why the Soviet army did not launch an offensive at the same time when the British and American forces launched their offensive last autumn to determine the outcome of this war. The answer that we can give is that the Soviet army was not ready at that time, and Eisenhower wanted to take the credit for conquering Germany alone, so he launched an offensive without waiting for its ally. Secondly, Stalin may have expected that the British and American autumn offensive would fail, so he did not attack, waiting for the German army to be exhausted on the Western Front and the Eastern Front defenses to be weakened, so that the Soviet army could easily attack. In fact, these are all his miscalculations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls Stationed in Turkey Prepare to Return Home</h3>
<p>Zurich, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Ankara: The Japanese Ambassador to Turkey and his staff, as well as consuls, are preparing to return home. All other Japanese residents will also return home via the Soviet Union recently.</p>

Stalin wants to discuss the Dardanelles Strait issue at the conference. The Soviet Union wants to control the strait to maintain peace.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Ankara: Anti-Axis ships have passed through the Dardanelles Strait in recent days. The Turkish government has confirmed that the strait is open for anti-Axis shipping.</p>
<h3>German Troops in the Ardennes on the Western Front Engage in Disengagement Movement; Little Change in the Southern Wing</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: There have been no major changes on the Western Front in the past 24 hours. The German army in the Eastern Ardennes is carrying out a disengagement movement according to plan in order to preserve its strength. The anti-Axis forces have suffered heavy losses as a result of this movement. The German army has increased pressure from the north and east of the Salm River basin and from the south between Wilz and Diekirch, so that the American army has not been able to break into the German positions. In other sections of the Western Front, the American actions in Remich, Saarlautern, and other places are only an attempt to divert attention. The pressure exerted by the American army east and southeast of Saargemünd is concentrated on the flanks of the German army in the Vosges area, but it has not achieved significant results. On the Hatton and Rhidahofen fronts, the anti-Axis forces are fighting hard within the Maginot Line without making progress.</p>
<h3>Germany Releases Soviet Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - H.T.S. reports: The first batch of 173 Soviet prisoners of war, who have made special contributions in Germany, have been released in front of General Vlasov.

<h3>The Breakdown of the Chongqing-Communist Negotiations (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The reports and documents submitted by both the Chongqing (Nationalist) and Communist parties at the third session of the Chongqing Political Consultative Council on September 15th of last year were sufficient to fully expose the intensity of the Chongqing-Communist conflict and the impossibility of compromise. Excerpts of these were published in this newspaper on October 7th and 9th of last year. Now, having rediscovered the full text, we are reprinting it in its entirety to provide a complete overview.</p>
<p>Speech by Chongqing Representative Zhang Zhizhong to the Political Consultative Council</p>
<p>Regarding the progress of negotiations on the Communist issue, esteemed members of the National Political Consultative Council have requested a report. I, Zhang Zhizhong, have been ordered to represent the government and provide a concise report on the course of these negotiations, as follows:</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>In January of this year, Guo Zhongrong, the liaison staff officer sent by the Military Affairs Commission to the Eighteenth Group Army, reported to the Military Affairs Department via telegram, stating: "In a conversation on the sixteenth of this month, Mr. Mao Zedong indicated that the Communist Party of China (CPC) intends to select one or three individuals from Zhou Enlai, Lin Zuhan, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De to travel to Chongqing to meet with the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) for instructions. He also requested that this be reported for instructions as to whether this is permissible." On February 2nd, the Military Affairs Department replied via telegram to liaison staff officer Guo: "We warmly welcome Zhu, Zhou, and Lin to Chongqing. Please telegraph in advance of their arrival." Subsequently, liaison staff officer Guo telegraphed on February 18th: "Mr. Mao Zedong stated that the CPC has decided to send Mr. Lin Zuhan to Chongqing first." In April, we received another telegram from liaison staff officer Guo, stating that according to Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Lin Zuhan, Lin was scheduled to depart on April 28th. Upon receiving this report, the Central Government dispatched Mr. Zhang Zhizhong and Mr. Wang Shijie to Xi'an on May 1st to hold preliminary talks with Mr. Lin Zuhan. Mr. Lin and we arrived in Xi'an successively on the 2nd of May. From May 4th to 11th, we held a total of five meetings in Xi'an, producing a record. This record was sent to Mr. Lin for review, and after Mr. Lin made additions, deletions, and modifications, he handed it back to us in person and signed his name on the record. At that time, Mr. Lin asked us if we would also sign it. We believed that since this represented Mr. Lin's views, or at least his agreement with some of our views, only Mr. Lin should sign it. As for the Central Government's views, we would formally present them after returning to Chongqing for instructions. Now, the original text of the record signed by Mr. Lin is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Items Expressed in the Meetings from May 4th to May 8th</p>

<p>D. Other Matters</p>
<p>1. The CPC expresses its continued faithful implementation of the Four Pledges, supporting the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the war of resistance and in national reconstruction. The Kuomintang expresses its willingness to resolve the issues between the two parties fairly and reasonably through political means.</p>

Implementation will be guaranteed immediately after the war. If the wartime situation allows—such as during a general counteroffensive—movement can also be discussed and agreed upon.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Because Mr. Lin Zuhan had already expressed concrete opinions, we returned to Chongqing with Mr. Lin Zuhan on May 17th. At that time, the Central Government was about to hold the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and the National Administrative Conference. Despite being extremely busy, we still reported the content of the talks in Xi'an and the opinions expressed by Mr. Lin Zuhan to the Central Government, so that the Central Government could consider concrete solutions to this issue. On June 5th, when we met with Mr. Lin Zuhan, we handed over to Mr. Lin Zuhan a document titled "Central Government's Proposed Political Solution to the CPC Issue." Its original text is as follows:</p>
<p>June 5, Year 33 [1944] Central Government's Proposed Political Solution to the CPC Issue</p>
<p>Based on the opinions expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan in Xi'an, the following proposal is made:</p>
<p>A. Regarding Military Matters</p>
<p>1. The Eighteenth Group Army and all its troops in various locations shall be combined into four armies and ten divisions. Their designations shall be determined by order.</p>
<p>2. The Group Army shall obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>3. The number of personnel in the Group Army shall be in accordance with the standard establishment of the National Army (promulgated by the Ministry of Military Administration). No detachments, sub-detachments, or other designations shall be established outside of the establishment. All previous establishments shall be abolished within a time limit approved by the Central Government.</p>
<p>4. Personnel appointments in the Group Army shall be approved in accordance with personnel regulations.</p>
<p>5. The military expenditures of the Group Army shall be issued by the Central Government in accordance with the general provisions for the National Army and shall be handled in accordance with financial regulations, implementing independent military supply.</p>
<p>6. The education of the Group Army shall be implemented in accordance with the education program and instructions promulgated by the Central Government, and the Central Government shall send personnel to review it at any time.</p>
<p>7. The various units of the Group Army shall be concentrated for deployment within a time limit. Before concentration, all units within each theater of operations shall be subject to the training and command of the commander-in-chief of the theater of operations where they are located.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Issue</p>
<p>1. The name of the Border Region shall be designated as the Shaanbei (Northern Shaanxi) Administrative Region, and its administrative institution shall be called the Shaanbei Administrative Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>2. The area of the Administrative Region shall be limited to its existing area, but it must be surveyed and determined by personnel sent by the Central Government.</p>
<p>3. The Administrative Commissioner's Office shall be directly under the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>4. The Administrative Region shall implement Central Government laws and regulations. Laws and regulations required due to the special circumstances of the region shall be submitted to the Central Government for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>5. The chairman of the Administrative Region shall be appointed and dismissed by the Central Government, and the commissioners, county magistrates, and others under his jurisdiction may be nominated by the chairman for appointment by the Central Government.</p>

<p>7. The budget of the Administrative Region shall be compiled and submitted to the Central Government for approval annually.</p>
<p>8. In the Administrative Region and the areas where troops of the Eighteenth Group Army are stationed, no banknotes shall be issued. The banknotes already issued shall be handled in a manner agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>9. In other regions, all action organizations established by the CPC shall be taken over and handled by personnel sent by the provincial governments concerned.</p>
<p>C. Regarding Party Issues</p>
<p>1. They shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction during the war of resistance. After the end of the war, in accordance with the Central Government's resolution, a National Assembly shall be convened to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government. The Communist Party of China, like other political parties, shall abide by national laws and enjoy equal treatment.</p>
<p>2. The Communist Party of China should again express its faithful implementation of the Four Pledges.</p>
<p>After handing the Central Government's proposal to Mr. Lin Zuhan, we stated that if the CPC implemented the above measures, the Central Government would consider withdrawing the garrison troops in the defense areas, restoring commercial traffic between the region and its neighbors, and leniently bailing out CPC personnel arrested for illegal activities. Mr. Lin then took out a letter from his pocket, attached with a document titled "Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Solving Several Urgent Current Problems," and handed it to us for review. Its original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Solving Several Urgent Current Problems</p>
<p>The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the war of resistance has lasted for seven years. The CPC's loyalty to the country, its bravery in combat, its implementation of the Three Principles of the People, its practice of the Four Pledges, and its support of the National Government and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in the war of resistance and national reconstruction have been consistent and are evident to all. However, the current situation in the war of resistance is extremely serious. The Japanese army continues to attack, but the domestic political situation and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet moved onto a track suitable for the needs of the war of resistance. In order to overcome the current difficulties, resist the Japanese army's attack, and earnestly prepare for a counteroffensive, the CPC believes that the only way is to implement democracy and strengthen unity. To this end, the CPC hopes that the government will solve the following extremely urgent problems. Some of these problems concern national politics, and some concern the unresolved issues between the two parties. They are listed frankly below:</p>
<p>A. Regarding National Politics</p>
<p>1. The government should implement democratic politics, guarantee freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and person.</p>
<p>2. The government should lift the ban on parties, recognize the legal status of the CPC and various anti-Japanese parties, and release patriotic political prisoners.</p>
<p>3. The government should allow the implementation of genuine local autonomy for the people.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Unresolved Issues Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>1. Based on the needs of the war of resistance, the achievements in the war of resistance, and the actual number of existing troops, the government should organize the CPC troops into sixteen armies and forty-seven divisions, with 10,000 men per division. For the sake of compromise, at least five armies and sixteen divisions should be designated for now.</p>
<p>2. The government should recognize the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the popularly elected governments in the North China base areas as legal local governments and recognize the various facilities needed for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>3. The defense areas of the CPC troops should remain as they are during the war of resistance and be negotiated separately after the end of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>4. The government should fully provide material assistance to the Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Since 1940, the government has provided no bullets, no medicine, no money, and no grain. This situation should be changed immediately.</p>
<p>5. Weapons, ammunition, and medicine provided by the Allied countries to China should be fairly distributed to all Chinese troops. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army should receive their fair share.</p>
<p>6. The government should order military and political organs to lift the military and economic blockade against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various base areas.</p>
<p>7. The government should order military organs to cease military attacks against the New Fourth Army in Central China and the guerrillas in Guangdong.</p>
<p>8. The government should order party and government organs to release arrested personnel in various places, such as Ye Ting and other officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army captured during the Southern Anhui Incident, Liao Chengzhi and Zhang Wenbin in Guangdong, Xu Jie, Xu Mengqiu, Mao Zemin, Yang Zhihua, and Pan Que in Xinjiang, Luo Shiwen, Che Liangxian, Li Chun, and Zhang Shaoming in Sichuan, He Bin in Hubei, Liu Ying in Zhejiang, and Xuan Xiafu, Shi Zuoxiang, Li Yuhai, Chen Yuanying, and Zhao Xiang in Xi'an. These personnel are all patriotic people and should be restored to freedom.</p>
<p>9. The government should allow the CPC to establish party offices and newspapers throughout the country. The CPC also allows the Kuomintang to establish party offices and newspapers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various democratic border regions.</p>
<p>The above are just the main points. The CPC sincerely hopes that our National Government will give them a reasonable and as prompt a solution as possible. If our Kuomintang and Communist parties can not only continue to cooperate but also refresh domestic politics and improve party relations, it will not only greatly benefit the current situation but also cast a solid dawn on next year's large-scale counteroffensive in coordination with the Allied countries. We hope that our government will act in its best interests.</p>
<p>Lin Zuhan, Representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, June 4, Year 33 [1944] At this time, we said to Mr. Lin Zuhan: Because the twenty items you presented last time on May 22nd differed greatly in content from the opinions expressed in Xi'an, they could not be accepted and were taken back by you. Although the twelve items presented this time are fewer, the content has not changed and cannot be accepted. However, not wishing to entirely dismiss your intention, we only agreed to keep them but could not submit them. At that time, Mr. Lin also said that it would be good to keep them with you two for reference.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>On June 6th, we received a letter from Mr. Lin Zuhan, making two points of clarification regarding the Central Government's proposal: First, he believed that the proposal differed greatly from the opinions formally presented by the CPC on June 4th. In addition to reporting the proposal to the CPC Central Committee for instructions, he requested that the twelve articles proposed by the CPC be forwarded to the Central Government for a reasonable solution. Second, he believed that the statement at the beginning of the proposal, "Based on the opinions expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan in Xi'an," was inconsistent with the facts. He believed that the Xi'an record was "a preliminary opinion jointly created in the end" and that he agreed to "each seek instructions from their respective central committees before making a final decision." Therefore, he still hoped that the Central Government would consider the opinions formally presented by the CPC recently. We immediately replied to Mr. Lin in a letter on June 8th, addressing the two points he clarified: First, the letter submitted by Mr. Lin on June 5th was not forwarded because the differences were too great, as had been stated. Mr. Lin said in the end: "It would be good to keep them with you two for reference," so we only agreed to keep them at the time but still stated that we could not forward them. Second, the content of the Xi'an talks was recorded, modified, and then rewritten by Mr. Lin before being signed. We have already forwarded this to the Central Government, so the Central Government's proposal is based on Mr. Lin's opinions and has accommodated Mr. Lin's opinions as much as possible. We hope that Mr. Lin can fully accept it.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>On June 11th, we received another letter from Mr. Lin, who believed that "there are two points that are very difficult to understand" in our letter of June 8th: First, since we have recognized him as the representative of the CPC, we should not fail to report the opinions formally presented by the CPC to the Central Government but only unilaterally require him to accept the Central Government's proposal. How can he make the decision on his own? Second, he admitted that the twelve articles submitted on June 5th were "slightly different" from the opinions negotiated in Xi'an, but the Central Government's proposal also differed from the opinions negotiated in Xi'an. He believed that such differences in the negotiation process were normal for both parties and should not be considered strange. He has now telegraphed the Central Government's proposal to the CPC Central Committee, and we should not refuse to forward the opinions formally presented by the CPC to the Central Government for instructions.</p>
<p>In fact, the two points that Mr. Lin said he could not understand were very clear. Precisely because Mr. Lin is the representative of the CPC, his expressed opinions can of course be taken into account. As for the twelve articles subsequently proposed by the CPC, the content differed greatly from Mr. Lin's opinions, and the CPC did not express its fundamental concept of obeying military and political orders but only made one-sided demands. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why we solemnly stated at the time that we could not forward them. However, because we hoped that the problem would be resolved one day, we were unwilling to cause misunderstandings, so we still forwarded the twelve articles submitted by Mr. Lin to the Central Government. The Central Government then instructed that "The Central Government had already submitted the proposal to Representative Lin on June 5th to be conveyed to the CPC. All opinions of the CPC that the Central Government can accommodate have been accommodated as much as possible in the proposal. We hope that the CPC will accept it."</p>
<p>On June 15th, we conveyed the Central Government's instructions to Mr. Lin and stated that the basic spirit of this negotiation must be based on the principle of unifying national military and political orders as a prerequisite for improving the current situation and strengthening unity. The content of the twelve articles proposed by the CPC did not mention how to implement the military and political orders of the Central Government and improve measures to reorganize troops. As for the number of troops to be reorganized, we said in Xi'an that the possible number of troops to be reorganized was three armies and eight divisions. Now, the Central Government's proposal has decided on four armies and ten divisions, which is two divisions more than what we said. This shows that the Central Government has accommodated as much as possible.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>After we replied to Mr. Lin on June 15th, the CPC did not respond to the Central Government's proposal for more than ten days. On July 3rd, Mr. Lin met with us and verbally proposed two points for discussion regarding the Central Government's proposal: First, regarding political issues, he hoped that the Central Government would relax the scope of "democracy"; second, regarding military issues, he hoped to expand the reorganization to five armies and sixteen divisions. At the same time, he said that there was a telegram from Yan'an welcoming us two to Yan'an for negotiations. At that time, we explained that the government was already taking various measures to promote the implementation of democratic politics, such as abolishing the method of compulsory censorship of books and strictly ordering the completion of the establishment of county councils in various provinces in the rear, and that the Central Government was about to announce laws to protect the personal freedom of the people, as well as many other measures regarding democracy that are being planned, which need not be listed. As for the issue of the number of troops to be expanded, the Central Government is implementing a policy of streamlining troops and tightening units as much as possible. It has already accommodated the CPC's demands to the greatest extent. If one compares the number of National Army troops in the early stages of the war of resistance with the current increase in numbers, one can understand the Central Government's difficult position in seeking compromise. Finally, we believed that continuing to talk like this was somewhat like deliberately delaying. It seemed that the Central Government's proposal should be given a comprehensive and accurate response as a basis for concrete discussions, and it was not appropriate to continue to go back and forth with empty words and bargain over prices, which would only increase complications. We stated that if a conclusion could be reached in Chongqing, we could consider visiting Yan'an.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>On July 13th, Mr. Lin came to meet again. At that time, he again asked the Central Government to give some "instructions" on the twelve items they had proposed, but he did not mention how to respond to the proposal given to them by the Central Government. At that time, we had already explained most of the issues raised by Mr. Lin in the past and did not need to argue further. We only replied that Mr. Lin's intentions were clear and that we would schedule another meeting to discuss and then dispersed.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>On July 23rd, Mr. Lin sent another letter, the content of which was still asking whether we had requested instructions and replies regarding his proposed twelve items and asking us to go to Yan'an.</p>
<p>On July 25th, we met with Mr. Lin again and gave a more detailed explanation of the various items in his proposed twelve items and informed him that the proposal put forward by the Central Government was the Central Government's specific opinion, but the CPC had not responded to it for a long time. We also said that the CPC's attitude was very much like deliberately delaying and unwilling to solve this problem.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Staff Discovers Embezzlement Case Reported in the English-Language "The Times"</h3>
<p>According to reports in this city's English-language "The Times" on the 13th and 15th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau recently discovered a major embezzlement case. The contents are translated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Among the embezzlement cases in the Public Works Bureau, the fact that attracts the most attention is the illegal felling and sale of trees along Great Western Road and Hongqiao Road. It is also said that trees in municipal parks, such as Zhongshan Park (formerly Zhaofeng Park), have also been secretly felled and sold.</p>
<p>This public welfare facility, which was completed at great expense for the benefit of Shanghai citizens, is now being destroyed. The highest municipal authorities should immediately investigate and punish those responsible.</p>
<p>After obtaining the above information, "The Times" conducted an investigation into the activities of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. It is understood that some employees of the Public Works Bureau, due to insufficient salaries to maintain their livelihoods, are using their positions to collect illegal fees from outside sources. This situation is not unique to the Public Works Bureau, but is also occurring in other bureaus.</p>
<p>Illegal Tree Felling The newspaper further learned that the scale of the embezzlement case in the Public Works Bureau must have been tacitly approved or colluded with by its superiors. It is said that some people in the Municipal Government Secretariat are also involved in this large-scale embezzlement case. Regarding the illegal felling and sale of trees, the Parks Section of the Public Works Bureau is the most suspected. This section originally belonged to the Road Administration Section, but was recently transferred to the Architectural Section.</p>
<p>At that time, the authorities did not explain the reason for the transfer of this section, and it seemed very unreasonable. It is said that the pruning of trees on various roads this winter could yield as much as 8 million yuan in firewood. Furthermore, the trees felled and sold along Hongqiao Road and Great Western Road numbered up to 200, which are estimated to be worth about 1 million yuan in firewood.</p>
<p>It is understood that when the city's first and eighth districts were merged, the municipal government commissioned experienced personnel to take leadership positions in various departments and sections of the Public Works Department. However, 24 of these appointment letters were "switched" by others, resulting in the use of people who were not originally appointed.</p>
<p>Receiving Kickbacks These people have no knowledge of practical technology, which has led to the current state of corruption. It is an open secret that the department adds a 20% kickback when purchasing materials from outside. Anyone who deals with the department knows this. The department purchases approximately 12 million yuan worth of materials each month, so this kickback is very considerable.</p>
<p>Even worse, materials stored in the municipal government warehouse, if purchased by the person in charge of the Public Works Department, are calculated at the original price. For example, the market prices of cement and steel plates have already increased a thousandfold, but the Public Works Bureau can purchase them from the municipal government warehouse at a price of one-thousandth of the market price, and then resell them, making countless profits in a single transaction. Of course, this illegal activity requires the approval of their superiors. A large number of municipal government stockpiles, such as cement, steel plates, and coal, are cleared out under various pretexts. For example, the warehouse in the former eighth district was well-stocked before the merger, but now all important materials, such as coal, automobile parts, cement, steel plates, canvas, and other parts, are all empty.</p>
<p>Under the bureau's budget, the construction and repair costs in the suburban areas originally accounted for a significant portion. Each repair cost requires about 10 million yuan. However, at present, citizens rarely pay attention to the road administration and construction situation in the suburbs, and the municipal government has not sent personnel to inspect it. Therefore, after receiving the repair funds, the department only perfunctorily performs the work, and distributes the remaining funds to private individuals. For example, the contract for the construction fee of Zhongshan Road was 7 million yuan, and the department also supplied 8 million yuan of asphalt. However, the work was not completed according to the plan, and it will still need to be repaired soon.</p>
<p>Fictitious Payroll Furthermore, it is said that the salaries of personnel in various departments and sections of the bureau are paid to hundreds of people who do not actually exist. Repair work costs are extremely difficult to estimate accurately, so it is easy to falsify them. At least 20% of the repair costs of various projects are due to extra increases. The municipal government-approved construction of municipal memorial pavilions is now subject to a 40% increase in the budget by the department, totaling 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the obtaining of building permits, regardless of whether there are violations, "tips" must be paid before they can be obtained. Even without obtaining a permit after paying the tip, construction can begin, and the safety of building materials is not considered at all. The "tip" required for each building is approximately between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In order to prevent unlicensed peddlers from setting up stalls in the roads and alleys, investigations were conducted, and approximately 20,000 private vendors were found to exist. However, since the municipal merger, they have not been prohibited. Instead, under the pretext of investigation, they privately collect tips. The fee ranges from several thousand to tens of thousands, depending on the size of each stall.</p>
<p>Extorting Tips Regarding the registration of construction contracts and projects, their qualifications are rarely investigated, and the registration fee is about 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Furthermore, in the name of ensuring industrial safety, the bureau often issues warnings to various factories, hoping to extort tips when the factories request inspections. The fee standard depends on the size of the motor and boiler. Once the tip is paid, safety issues are not taken seriously at all.</p>
<p>The bribes collected by the bureau are split in a 40/60 manner, distributed among upper and lower staff. The bureau's seal supervisor also routinely demands tips of 1,000 to 10,000 yuan from the applicant before printing contracts.</p>
<p>The new municipal authorities have now taken office, and it is said that they will conduct an investigation into this embezzlement case. It is expected that the truth will come to light soon. (Translated from "The Times")</p>
<h3>Director Liu of the Propaganda Department Talks About Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Dexuan, the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department, recently announced the following policy guidelines: "I have been appointed to head the Municipal Propaganda Department. I am deeply concerned about the heavy responsibilities and my limited abilities. However, since I have been appointed, I will strive to advance in the area of propaganda based on the established national policy. In my work, I will follow the instructions of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo and gradually promote it. The censorship of comedies and cultural registration will be handled in accordance with laws and regulations, without favoritism or abuse of the law. All colleagues in this department have a fixed living allowance. If there is any bribery between each other, once it is verified, I will request the superiors to investigate and deal with it. In short, the situation in Shanghai is complex and the temptation is great. If we do not invigorate people's hearts, we cannot reverse the decadent trend. I will not consider success or failure, praise or criticism. Fortunately, the city's cultural elders and advanced figures in the newspaper industry are all old friends. I hope they will give me guidance and assistance at any time, for the benefit of both public and private interests."</p>
<h3>Personnel Adjustment in the Municipal Economic Bureau</h3>
<p>After Xu Jiang took over as the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, he made some adjustments to the internal organization. The Secretariat was originally divided into six sections, but now it has been changed to seven. The seventh section specializes in investigation and statistics. All secretaries and section chiefs were appointed and developed yesterday. The secretaries are Ding Lizhi and Wu Chongfu, the chief of the first section is Kong Songqiao, the specialist and assistant in charge of the first section is Xu Yi, the chief of the second section is Chen Litian, the chief of the third section is Tang Shaohang, the chief of the fourth section is Niu Yupeng, the chief of the fifth section is Wu De, the chief of the sixth section is Zhang Dexin, and the chief of the seventh section is Cai Zhengya. The original deputy chief of the first section, Wang Zuwen, was transferred to the deputy chief of the sixth section.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Solve Cases Quickly The Authorities Award Bonuses</h3>
<p>Li Shiyu, the Director of the Judicial Department of the Police Bureau, investigated the "murder due to long-standing resentment over extortion without results" and "strangulation of wife and children" tragic murder cases that occurred in the jurisdiction of the Laoza and Taishan sub-bureaus. The murderer in the former case, Wu Quanhai, and the criminal in the latter case, Li Ziying, were both arrested within 24 hours by the judicial sections of the respective sub-bureaus. This is highly commendable. Therefore, 150,000 yuan was allocated from the crime prevention fund as a bonus to encourage them. The Laoza district blood case was relatively complicated and took time to investigate, so 100,000 yuan was allocated. Director Li (Deputy Director Xian'erlang acting on his behalf) and Yang Xionghua, the chief of the Crime Prevention Section, went to each sub-bureau yesterday to award the bonuses, which were awarded by Deng Zhaojin and Liu Junqing, the directors of the respective judicial sections. A meeting of all staff was immediately convened for instructions.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow Association Begins Registration for Scholarship Funds</h3>
<p>The Scholarship Fund Committee of the Zhenjiang Native Place Association in Shanghai has decided to start registering old students from the 18th to the 28th of this month. All Shanghai native place children who intend to continue their studies in the next semester should bring their credentials to the association's office on the second floor of No. 3 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, to obtain an application form. Applications submitted after the deadline will be considered a waiver of rights, and no extension will be granted.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Entertain Leaders from All Walks of Life, Both Chinese and Foreign</h3>

<h3>Fundraising for Memorial Gold Coins Welcome to Visit and Bid</h3>
<p>An unnamed person has a rare gold coin commemorating the establishment of the Constitution during the Cao Kun era. It weighs about one tael and has crossed national flags on one side, which is rarely seen on the market and is extremely precious. Now, this unnamed person, for the sake of helping students who have dropped out of school and doing good deeds, has specially decided to auction this coin. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to our newspaper's scholarship fund, winter relief, the Shelter from the Cold, the Zhe-Shao Hospital, the Yongxi Hall, the Holy Mother's Infant Home, and other expenses.

<h3>Reader Scholarship News The Kuguan Troupe Performs "Autumn Begonia" for Free to Raise Scholarship Funds for Two Newspapers All Proceeds from the Two Charity Performances Are Donated</h3>
<p>Speaking of the "Kuguan Troupe", everyone admits that it is the most progressive and strongest troupe in Shanghai, with talented playwrights and actors who look down on everything; speaking of "Autumn Begonia", it is also recognized as the most famous and popular spoken drama on the stage, which was performed continuously for five months in the past and was indeed a rare masterpiece. The Kuguan people have always held the belief that "serving life is our ultimate goal." This shows the progress of their thinking and the philosophy of their lives. In the past year or more, they performed charity performances for our newspaper's scholarship fund for six months in the early stage, and then worked hard for the drama for ten months in the later stage. Now, as the "Paris" lease expires and performances are stopped, they are holding five public performances at the Lyceum Theatre to raise funds for the development of the troupe. This spirit of "self-improvement" is worthy of admiration! Recently, the Kuguan people, because the difference in the scholarship fund of the Shen and Xin newspapers is very large, decided to add two performances after the public performances. All proceeds, except for necessary expenses, will be used to fill the scholarship fund for the two newspapers. Gentlemen, you are enthusiastic about helping students and brave in doing good. The colleagues of the two newspapers express their sincere gratitude. They also stated that they have been performing day and night for more than a year and are exhausted physically and mentally. After the charity performance is over, they will temporarily part with the audience for a considerable period of rest. This time, the two newspapers are grateful for the kindness of the Kuguan people and will of course respectfully accept it. At that time, we will specially select the best seats and issue "honor tickets", divided into two types of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan. Today, the authorities of the two newspapers will send out special letters to invite enthusiastic people from all walks of life to appreciate the famous drama. Because the deadline is approaching, we hope that you will give your support so that we can gather a sufficient amount to enhance the effect of helping students, benefiting the poor and cultivating talents for the country, which is a great merit!</p>

<h3>Splendid Tea Party at the Municipal Government: Four Allied Dignitaries</h3>
<p>Among the Allied guests present yesterday, four were particularly noteworthy. The first was the most senior member of the National Government, who, despite his advanced age, did not hesitate to travel far and wide, embodying kindness and harmony, and serving as a role model for future generations. The second was Mr. Takashima, President of the Central China Revival Company, whose hair was as white as silver, but whose complexion was as rosy as a young man's, demonstrating his mastery of maintaining good health. President Takashima is deeply absorbed in Chinese calligraphy and painting, possesses extensive knowledge, and is an authority in the economic circles of Central China. The third was Colonel Okada, the newly appointed advisor to the Municipal Government. Colonel Okada is extremely familiar with the situation in our country, has friends all over the country, and is known for his intelligence and competence. The fourth was Mr. Inoue, Deputy Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee. Dressed in formal attire, he had an imposing figure. Mr. Inoue is an aristocrat from an Allied nation, yet he condescended to serve our country, not only holding an important position in Mitsui &amp; Co., but also assisting Mr. Sun Zhongli as the Deputy Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee.</p>
<p>Gathering of Five Elders</p>
<p>It was reported that the elders Lan Ting, Li Sihao, Pei Yunqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou gathered in a corner for a pleasant conversation. Elder Li was late to the event due to another appointment. Guests all came forward to greet them, and the newly appointed bureau directors also exchanged cordial greetings, demonstrating that the ancient tradition of respecting the elderly remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Tuition Issues</p>
<p>In one corner of the venue, Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Chen Binhe, all members of the Municipal Advisory Committee, and Mr. Dai Yingfu, Director of the Education Bureau, were seen engaged in earnest conversation, focusing on the issue of school fees. It is said that the Municipal Advisory Committee will hold a meeting this Friday to further discuss the matter with the Municipal Education Authority, benefiting students and rescuing those who have dropped out of school, which are two important objectives.</p>
<p>Control Groups</p>
<p>Officials from various control committees attended the event. Mr. Sun Zhongli, Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, displayed a dignified demeanor, clearly a person willing to take responsibility, which explains why his committee has achieved outstanding results among the control organizations, which is no coincidence. Mr. Luo Nezhai, Chairman of the Daily Necessities Control Committee, is talented, competent, and insightful, and is a prominent figure among the rising stars. Mr. Dai Yunlu, a member of the Rice Control Committee, arrived before the former chairman, Mr. Chen Guoquan. Mr. Dai was modestly dressed and extremely amiable. Mr. Tong Lüqing, a member of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, and Mr. Kurimoto, Deputy Chairman of the Oil and Grain Control Committee, also attended yesterday's event. Mr. Kurimoto has been living in China for over thirty years, is fluent in Chinese, and is a most enthusiastic friend of China.</p>
<p>Within the Press Circle</p>
<p>Many figures from the press attended the event. Mr. Jin Xiongbo, President of the Ping Bao newspaper, had temples as white as flowers, yet was full of energy. Mr. Chen Riping, Deputy President of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, was elegant and refined. Mr. Huang Jingzhai, President of the Guomin Xinwen newspaper, possessed the spirit of a young and vigorous person. Mr. Lu Feng of the Xin Zhongguo Bao newspaper was enthusiastic. Mr. Hidaka, the editor-in-chief of the Dalu Xinbao newspaper, and reporter Takemoto were actively moving around, engaging with others.</p>
<p>Two Rare Guests</p>
<p>Two rare guests attended yesterday's tea party. One was Mr. Cen Xing Shu, whose demeanor exuded the composure of a great statesman. He studied at Gakushuin University in Japan, an institution where only Allied nobles could study, and commoners were not allowed to enter. Mr. Cen and his brother were granted special permission to enter the university by Prince Konoe Atsumaro (father of Prince Konoe Fumimaro), becoming the only foreign students in the university. Mr. Cen is familiar with the Allied national conditions and is a true expert on Japan. The other was Mr. Zhou Zuomin, an authority in the financial circles, who arrived at the event very early. Both rarely attend various gatherings, making them particularly rare guests at this tea party.</p>
<p>The Hosts' Side</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou Qun was slightly late due to official duties. He, along with Secretary-General Luo and the newly appointed Director of the Economic Bureau Xu Jiang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Jidun, Director of the Material Distribution Office Liu Xingchen, and Director of the Propaganda Office Liu Dexuan, greeted guests at the entrance, shaking hands as a gesture of courtesy. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo were dressed in black national attire, displaying a solemn demeanor and keen eyes, revealing both determination and enthusiasm, suggesting a firm resolve to reform municipal affairs in the future. The new bureau and office directors exchanged business cards with the guests, remaining extremely busy. Li Shiyu, the Director of the Judicial Affairs Department of the Police Bureau, who also newly serves as the Chief Secretary of the Municipal Government, both old and new, was a noteworthy figure on the host side.

<p>Our City's Transferred Officials Departed for Anhui Yesterday</p>
<p>Former Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Ye Xuesong, Director of the Propaganda Office Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Shanghai News Inspection Office Liu Shike, and others who have been transferred to work in Anhui Province, along with a group of people, departed from Shanghai by train at 8:30 AM yesterday (the 17th), passing through Nanjing and heading to Bengbu. Many people from various circles went to the station to see them off.</p>
<p>Collection Methods for Municipal School Fees</p>
<p>The collection methods for tuition fees for municipal primary and secondary schools in this city have been announced by the authorities. The fee collection dates for each school have also been specified: from January 20th to January 31st for schools in the old city, and from January 15th to January 20th for schools in the former 182 districts.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices of Daily Necessities: Authorities are Thoroughly Investigating</p>
<p>Recently, the prices of various daily necessities in this city have risen sharply, significantly impacting people's livelihood. The reason for this is nothing more than manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. Relevant authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation, and those found to be manipulating the prices of daily necessities will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a dispatch reports that the arrival of firewood is plentiful, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 loads per day. However, due to the recent unusual tightness of credit and the imminent start of prioritized electricity distribution for factories by the authorities, the purchasing power is extremely weak, and sales are sluggish. According to industry insiders, the general price of firewood is unlikely to rise during the Lunar New Year.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of the First Division Football League: Portuguese Merchants in the Lead, Lianyi and Overseas Chinese Federation Have High Hopes</h3>
<p>The schedule of this year's First Division Football League is already over half completed. Yesterday, the Football Federation announced the recent situation of the group as follows:</p>
<p>According to the above situation, Portuguese Merchants have won nine games, making them the only team to maintain a perfect record. This is because the Overseas Chinese Federation lost to Lianyi, and Lianyi shook hands and drew with German Merchants last week. Donghua has lost twice and their future looks bleak. Portuguese Merchants have the highest chance of winning the championship. The Overseas Chinese Federation and Lianyi still have some hope. There are four games left, and the outcome of this year's title will depend on Lianyi vs. Portuguese Merchants, Donghua vs. Overseas Chinese Federation, Lianyi vs. Donghua, and Portuguese Merchants vs. Overseas Chinese Federation. The battle between Portuguese and Overseas Chinese teams is scheduled for 10:00 AM this Sunday at Yiyuan. This major battle is worth paying attention to. If Portuguese Merchants win, only Lianyi remains as a barrier. Otherwise, the Overseas Chinese Federation and the Portuguese team will be neck and neck, which will create a different situation. The bottom two teams will definitely be one of the Three Provinces or Russian Sports, because both teams have lost every game and have not yet won.</p>
<h3>Basketball League: Hualian Defeats Renyu, Yikang Wins Over Lianyi in Women's Group</h3>
<p>In the second act of the Shanghai Basketball League last night, Hualian defeated Renyu 36-24. In the first half, Renyu led all the way before Hualian tied the score at 17 each. Renyu fought fiercely last night. Hualian did not use its formal lineup in the first half, which created this tense situation. Jingsheng beat Huaqiang 34-19. The first half ended with a score of 13-11. Huaqiang is a group of veteran players from the Paramount, including the Gu brothers, Lu Dazhen, Qian Jingyong, and others. Unfortunately, the generals are old, and their hearts and strength are mismatched. In the women's group, Lianyi and Yikang performed equally and were indistinguishable. Lianyi led by one point with a score of 12-11 in the first half. In the end, Yikang defeated Lianyi 28-23.</p>

<h3>The Breakdown of the Chongqing-Communist Negotiations (Continued from Page 2)</h3>
<p>During this period, we continued to study this issue and considered having another face-to-face meeting after the last verbal reply. We explained that we were preparing to put the opinions from the last verbal reply into a written reply, and at the same time, we waited for your definite reply to the Central Government's proposed plan. Only then would we consider further negotiations and the question of whether to go to Yan'an. After this conversation, on August 10th, we wrote a letter based on our previous intention and sent it to Mr. Lin. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>"More than three months have passed since we met in Xi'an on May 3rd, and more than two months have passed since we handed over the Central Government's proposed plan on June 5th. Until now, we have not received a definite reply from the Chinese Communist Party, which is beyond our initial expectations. The content of this Government's proposed plan not only accommodates almost all of the requests made by Commander Lin Biao last year, but also accommodates most of the opinions expressed by you in Xi'an. Since the Chinese Communist Party has expressed its support for unity and unification, please urge it to accept it.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese Communist Party's twelve points of opinion, the first to third points have been clearly stated in the Government's proposed plan: To implement the program of national reconstruction during the War of Resistance against Japan, which is accepted by the Chinese Communist Party and all parties; to implement constitutional government within one year after the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, giving all parties equal status. The meaning is clear and specific. It would only increase disputes in the future to promote some abstract statements that have no bounds beyond the declaration. The current policy established by the Central Government is to gradually expand the scope of people's freedom and promote local autonomy according to the progress of the War of Resistance against Japan, the approaching victory, and social stability. On the one hand, the Government hopes that the Chinese Communist Party will accept the proposed plan and submit opinions on implementing the program of national reconstruction at any time, and actively participate in the work of the Political Participation Council and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, so that the views of each other will gradually converge, and the true unity and unification of the country can be realized. This is the fundamental meaning of a political solution.</p>
<p>Four of the twelve points concern the army's organization, number, stationing, military pay, and weapons: The Eighteenth Group Army was originally organized into three divisions, and now it is allowed to expand into four armies and ten divisions. During the period when the Government is implementing a policy of streamlining troops and reducing units, this is a great effort to seek common ground while reserving differences. Regarding the army's stationing, the proposed plan instructs the principle of concentrated use on the one hand, and stipulates the training of the command system before concentration on the other hand, which is thoughtful in every aspect. As for military pay, it has been stipulated that the National Army will enjoy the same treatment. As for weapons, the Government will make a reasonable distribution at any time according to the needs and tasks it undertakes.</p>
<p>One of the twelve points requires the Government to recognize the 'Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region' and the 'Elected Governments in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas in North China'. Regarding the problem of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Government's proposed plan has put forward a very lenient approach. As for the administrative institutions in any other region, they should be taken over by the provincial governments under their jurisdiction after the proposal, so as to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>There are some other requirements that are either inconsistent with the facts or inconsistent with reason. We have already explained them to you verbally, so I will not repeat them here."</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>Later, we received a letter from Mr. Lin Zuhan on August 30th, replying to our letter of August 10th on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The gist is:</p>
<p>"1. It is considered that our letter of August 10th contains the meaning of blaming the Chinese Communist Party for unreasonably delaying, which is a completely unrealistic and erroneous view. Because the Government's proposed plan is too far apart in principle from the Chinese Communist Party's written twelve points and verbal eight points, and cited (1) the proposed plan does not mention a word about implementing democratic politics, recognizing the legality of all parties, and releasing political prisoners; (2) the number and organization of the army, the abolition of troops outside the organization, and the concentrated use of troops; (3) it only requires the border area government to implement central laws and regulations, but does not mention the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and does not recognize the current facilities and laws; (4) the abolition of the democratic governments elected by the people in the anti-Japanese base areas, etc., believing that they are too far apart. 2. It is believed that the obstacle to the fundamental solution of the problem is due to the great distance between the views of the Central Government and the Chinese Communist Party and the 'broad masses of the people' throughout the country, because the Government has always been unwilling to immediately implement the Three Principles of the People and the democratic system. 3. It is hoped that the Central Government should put the interests of the entire country and nation first in solving the national political problems and the problems of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and should proceed from the point of view of being conducive to national unity and resistance to Japan and promoting democracy. The latter repeated the 'political issues', 'army issues', and 'border areas' and 'base areas in Central China, South China, and North China' that had already been listed above, reaffirming the attitude held in the first item, while expanding many scopes. 4. It is stated that the Chinese Communist Party has always faithfully implemented the four promises, faithfully implemented the Three Principles of the People, and adhered to the policy of democratic unity and political solution, proving that the Chinese Communist Party does not want to break down the negotiations."</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lin's letter of August 30th, we felt surprised. To what extent is the truthfulness of the various situations mentioned in it? I think you all will have a very accurate judgment, so there is no need to add more explanation. We were ordered to negotiate specific issues. From going to Xi'an to now, we have talked about the issue more and more remotely. The reasons for this remoteness can be seen from the above documents. We cannot but feel sorry for it. However, we do not despair. In order to enable the Central Government to clearly understand our meaning, we then wrote a reply, the gist is:</p>
<p>"It is stated that the Central Government ordered us to negotiate with you in seeking the true unification of the whole country, that is, to seek the Chinese Communist Party to earnestly fulfill its four promises (see footnote) and earnestly support the unification of national power. If, as you said, the Chinese Communist Party has always fulfilled the four promises, then why have there been so many facts of infringement by the Chinese Communist Party against the National Army in various places? Why does the Central Government still have to order us to negotiate with you on issues such as obeying military orders and political orders today?</p>
<p>The Central Government ordered us to negotiate with you on unification, originally to establish a strong foundation for the future constitutional government and the implementation of the entire Three Principles of the People. Regarding democratic politics and party issues, the Central Government's proposed plan already has relevant clauses, and our letter of August 10th contains a detailed statement, so why say 'not a word'? The letter said that the Chinese Communist Party thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People in the border areas and various anti-Japanese base areas, and that in all areas of the Chinese Communist Party, all people and groups enjoy all freedoms and rights, but there are many facts that force us to deny. That is, with democracy and freedom, the legacy of the national father, we want to use the separation of powers to be the right track of democracy and the guarantee of the people's freedom. Is there any independent fact of judicial power and supervisory power in the Chinese Communist Party's region? Do the people in the Chinese Communist Party's region, even the Communist Party members, have the guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the body? Our previous letter hoped that we would not raise abstract demands without limit on issues such as democracy and freedom, and asked the Chinese Communist Party to discuss the solutions to various issues with the Central Government, the Political Participation Council, and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association at any time. Not only is it appropriate, it is also necessary.</p>
<p>It is explained that the various issues mentioned in the letter have already been answered one by one. One point is that the Central Government's proposed plan has already 'largely accommodated' the opinions put forward by Commander Lin Biao last year and by you in Xi'an recently. This is absolutely true, but you still emphasize that 'the distance is too far'. However, the reason why the distance is far is nothing more than because the Chinese Communist Party's demands are increasing with time. What you put forward in Xi'an is more than what Commander Lin put forward last year. The twelve points put forward by the Chinese Communist Party are more than what you put forward in Xi'an. This time, the letter added the so-called 'verbal eight points' to the twelve points. Since the requirements are increasing with time, the distance cannot but be far. For example, the problem of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the so-called 'other base areas'. What Commander Lin put forward was 'the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will be changed to an administrative region according to the original area, and other regions will be reorganized and implement central laws and regulations'. The documents you signed in Xi'an did not include 'other base areas'. In the twelve points put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, it is required to recognize the 'Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the elected governments in the anti-Japanese base areas in North China'. Your letter further said that 'the recognition of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government and the elected governments in the base areas in North China, Central China, and South China'. Under this situation of gradual changes and gradual expansion of demands, if negotiations cannot be approached, who is responsible for it?</p>
<p>It is explained that the Central Government and the Kuomintang will never put the interests of one party and one faction above the interests of the country and the nation. It is hoped that the Chinese Communist Party can also abide by this purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, it is said that as long as it is beneficial to the facts, we are happy to go to Yan'an. Now we ask whether the Chinese Communist Party can send a responsible representative to Chongqing to solve the problem, and who will be sent back to Chongqing with us as a representative.</p>
<p>Footnote: The four promises made by the Chinese Communist Party in September 1937</p>
<p>(1) The Three Principles of the People of Mr. Sun Yat-sen are necessary for China today, and our party is willing to strive for its thorough realization.</p>
<p>(2) Abolish all policies of overthrowing the Kuomintang regime and the Red bandit movement, and stop the policy of confiscating landlords' land by force.</p>
<p>(3) Abolish the current Soviet government, implement civil rights politics, in order to unify the national regime.</p>
<p>(4) Abolish the name and number of the Red Army, reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, and be under the command of the Military Commission of the National Government."</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>The important contents of the negotiation process and relevant documents are reported above one by one. Today, the problem of the Chinese Communist Party, for the sake of national unity and striving for victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the success of national construction, the people of the whole country are eagerly hoping for a reasonable solution as soon as possible. We have been ordered by the Central Government and shoulder the task of negotiation, and of course, we also hold the greatest enthusiasm and hope. What the Central Government requires is only the unity of revolution and political orders. Only in this way can there be true unity, can the military and civilians of the whole country be united, and only in this way can it be conducive to the War of Resistance against Japan and national construction. Under this major premise, the Central Government has spared no effort to seek common ground while reserving differences based on the harm of the matter, and has tried its best to accommodate the opinions of the Chinese Communist Party. This can be clearly seen in the Central Government's proposed plan. As for the issue of democracy and freedom, the Central Government has always focused on seeking truth from facts, doing it in reality, and not wanting to engage in empty talk. Under the principles of the program of national reconstruction during the War of Resistance against Japan, such as opening up speech, guaranteeing the freedom of the people, and expanding the powers of the people's organs, are all being carried out step by step, and we will continue to devote ourselves to this policy in the future, so that we can smoothly promote constitutional government after the end of the war. At that time, the problem of the party can naturally be solved. Now, although the Chinese Communist Party has not yet accepted the Central Government's proposed plan and expressed its intention to abide by the national military and political orders, we hope that the Chinese Communist Party will adhere to the true meaning of unity and resistance to Japan, and fulfill its promises with facts and actions to realize the true unification of the country. The Central Government will never change the policy of political solution, and sincerely expects the Chinese Communist Party to revise its views and solve this problem as soon as possible to comfort the expectations of the compatriots throughout the country. Because we know the urgency of you gentlemen on this issue, we have come to report on the negotiation process on this issue, and solemnly explain the attitude and wishes of the Central Government. We also ask you gentlemen for your advice.</p>

<h3>IV. The Twelve Articles Proposed by the Communist Party, June 4th, Year Thirty-Three</h3>
<p>Honorable Mr. Bai Xueting: The opinions of our party's Central Committee regarding the resolution of urgent issues, consisting of twenty articles, were submitted to you and Mr. [Another name] on the 22nd of last month but were not accepted. I immediately reported to Yan'an. Now I have received a reply from our party's Central Committee. In order to respect your opinions and facilitate negotiations, and to show our sincerity in resolving the issues, the twenty articles have been changed to twelve, and the minor issues have been changed to a memorandum. I am now specially copying a copy and request that it be forwarded to your party's president and your party's Central Committee for reply. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lin Zuhan, June 4th, Year Thirty-Three.</p>
<p>The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party presents to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang its opinions on resolving several urgent issues:</p>
<p>The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the War of Resistance has lasted for seven years. The Communist Party's loyalty to the country, its bravery in combat, its implementation of the Three Principles of the People, its fulfillment of the Four Pledges, and its support for the National Government and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction have been consistent and obvious to all. However, the current situation in the War of Resistance is extremely serious. The Japanese army continues to advance, and the domestic political situation and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet moved onto a track suitable for the needs of the War of Resistance. In order to overcome the current difficulties and earnestly prepare for the counter-offensive, the Communist Party believes that the only way is to implement democracy and strengthen unity. For this purpose, the Communist Party hopes that the government will resolve the following extremely urgent issues, including those related to national politics and those related to outstanding issues between the two parties. They are listed frankly as follows:</p>
<p>A. Regarding National Politics</p>
<p>1.  Please the government implement democratic politics and guarantee freedom of discussion, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom.</p>
<p>2.  Please the government lift the ban on parties, recognize the legal status of the Communist Party and all anti-Japanese parties, and release patriotic political prisoners.</p>
<p>3.  Please the government implement people's local autonomy that is worthy of the name.</p>
<p>B. Regarding Outstanding Issues between the Two Parties</p>
<p>1.  Based on the needs of the War of Resistance, the achievements of the War of Resistance, and the actual number of existing troops, the government should organize the Communist Party's troops into sixteen armies and forty-seven divisions, with 10,000 men per division. To compromise, at least give the designations of five armies and sixteen divisions at present.</p>
<p>2.  Please the government recognize the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the elected anti-Japanese governments in the North China base areas as legal local governments, and recognize their military facilities needed for the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>3.  The defense areas of the Communist Party's troops shall maintain the status quo during the War of Resistance, and shall be negotiated separately after the end of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>4.  Please the government provide sufficient material assistance to the Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Since 1940, the government has not provided a single bullet or grain of rice. Please change this situation quickly.</p>
<p>5.  Weapons, ammunition, and medicines provided by the Allied countries to China should be fairly distributed among the Chinese armies by the government. The Eighteenth Group Army and the New Fourth Army should receive their due share.</p>
<p>6.  Please the government order military and political agencies to lift the military and economic blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various base areas.</p>
<p>7.  Please the government order military agencies to cease military attacks on the New Fourth Army and the Guangdong guerrillas in Central China.</p>
<p>8.  Please the government order party and government agencies to release arrested personnel in various places. For example: Ye Ting and other officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army captured during the Southern Anhui Incident, Liao Chengzhi and Zhang Wenbin in Guangdong, Xu Jie, Xu Mengqiu, Mao Zemin, Yang Zhihua, Pan Qi and others in Xinjiang, Luo Shiwen, Che Zhuxian, Li Chun, Zhang Shaoming and others in Sichuan, He Bin and others in Hubei, Liu Ying in Zhejiang, and Xuan Xiafu, Shi Zuoxiang, Li Yuhai, Chen Yuanying, Zhao Xiang and others in Xi'an. These people are all patriotic people and should be restored to freedom.</p>
<p>9.  Please the government allow the Communist Party to establish party offices and newspapers throughout the country. The Communist Party also allows the Kuomintang to establish party offices and newspapers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various democratic border regions.</p>
<p>The above articles only cite the main points. The Communist Party sincerely hopes that our National Government will resolve them reasonably and as quickly as possible. Because the Japanese army is launching a large-scale offensive that threatens the War of Resistance front, if our Kuomintang and Communist Party not only continue to cooperate, but also refresh the national politics and improve the party relations, it will not only be of great benefit to the current situation, but also cast a solid dawn on next year's large-scale counter-offensive with the Allied countries. I hope our government will benefit from it. Lin Zuhan, representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. June 4th, Year Thirty-Three of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>V. Reply from Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong to the Communist Party's Twelve Articles, August 10th, Year Thirty-Three</p>
<p>Respected Mr. Boqu: It has been more than three months since we met with you in Xi'an on May 3rd and negotiated back and forth. It has been more than two months since we submitted the Central Government's proposed plan to you on June 5th, but we have not yet received a concrete response from the Communist Party. This situation is beyond our initial expectations. Before the government put forward the proposed plan, it specially ordered us to go to Xi'an to meet with you for as long as two weeks in order to fully listen to the opinions of the Communist Party. The intention was extremely prudent. The content of the government's proposed plan not only accommodated almost all the requests made by the Communist Party representative Master Lin Biao last year, but also largely accommodated the opinions you recently expressed in Xi'an. All these facts can be clearly understood by simply comparing and analyzing the relevant documents. We believe that political resolution has been expressed as agreed to by the Communist Party, and unity and unification have also been declared as supported by the Communist Party. Today, we cannot but earnestly request you to thoroughly present to the Communist Party leaders and urge them to accept the government's proposed plan and quickly reply to us. As for the twelve articles of opinions submitted by you on June 5th, we had already sent the government's instructions and our feelings to you in writing on June 15th. Now, because you have repeatedly urged us, we will provide a more detailed reply and explain the government's intentions in more detail to you:</p>
<p>1.  The first, second, and third articles of the twelve articles involve the implementation of democratic politics, guaranteeing freedom, recognizing the legal status of the Communist Party, and local autonomy. Regarding these issues, the government's proposed plan has already clearly stated two points: that during the War of Resistance, we will implement the Guiding Principles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction that have been accepted by the Communist Party and all parties, and that within one year after the end of the War of Resistance, we will implement constitutional governance and give all parties equal status. This statement is clearer and more specific. If the Communist Party wants to put forward some abstract sentences with no boundaries, such as "implement democratic politics" and "guarantee freedom," in addition to this statement, what benefit will it ultimately have for the facts? It will only increase disputes in the future. Because the "democratic politics" and other things that the Communist Party believed in in the past or today are not necessarily the same as what Kuomintang members and even general democrats believe in. Now, there are two things I want to tell you: (1) The established policy of the Central Government is to gradually expand the scope of people's freedom and promote local autonomy according to the progress of the War of Resistance, the approach of victory, and the stability of society. (2) The government hopes that after accepting the proposed plan, the Communist Party will put forward opinions on the implementation of the Guiding Principles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction at any time and actively participate in the work of the Political Participation Council and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association. If we can do this, our views will gradually converge, and the true unification and unity of the country can be realized. The fundamental meaning of political resolution lies in this.</p>
<p>2.  The four articles of the twelve articles involve the number of troops, the location of the troops, the military salaries, and the military equipment. The original approved establishment of the Eighteenth Group Army was 45,000 people. The government's proposed plan allows the organization of four armies and ten divisions, which is indeed a lenient approval. Because it is originally unacceptable for commanding officers to expand the army on their own, and the government is implementing a policy of streamlining troops. During this period, it is only the Eighteenth Group Army that is allowed to expand into four armies and ten divisions, which is the ultimate compromise. Regarding the location of the troops, the government has also considered it again. The proposed plan indicates the principle of concentrated use on the one hand and stipulates that they should be reorganized and commanded by the commander of the war zone where they are located before the concentration. The principle and the facts have been taken into account. If, as proposed by the Communist Party, the defense areas of the troops are maintained throughout the entire War of Resistance, how can the Central Government plan a counter-offensive or direct combat? As for military salaries, the proposed plan has already allowed the Eighteenth Group Army to enjoy the same treatment as the general National Army. The supply of military equipment will be fairly and reasonably distributed by the government at any time according to the needs of the counter-offensive and the tasks undertaken by each army.</p>
<p>3.  One of the twelve articles of opinions lists a request for the government to recognize the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" and the "elected governments of the North China base areas." The government is willing to consider the issue of the Shaanbei Border Region and has put forward a very generous solution in the proposed plan to accommodate the opinions of the Communist Party. As for the administrative agencies in any other region, they should be taken over by the governments of the provinces concerned in accordance with the instructions of the proposed plan in order to avoid differences and prevent abuses.</p>
<p>4.  Some of the twelve articles of opinions are inconsistent with the facts (such as setting certain conditions on the Central Government's reporting in Shaanbei, etc.). We have explained them to you orally and will not repeat them here. As for the two requests in the twelve articles of opinions regarding the lifting of the "military blockade" of Shaanbei and the release of some criminals, we have orally stated to you that we will consider them after the current negotiations have achieved concrete results.</p>
<p>In summary, the government has accommodated the opinions of the Communist Party to the greatest possible extent. As for the government's fundamental wishes, they lie in the thoroughness and unity of military and political orders. When the Communist Party put forward the twelve articles of opinions, it did not include the subordination to the Central Government's military and political orders as an item in the clauses. Even the introduction of the document did not provide a clear and clear expression of the Communist Party's future attitude towards this fundamental issue. We did not dare to forward it at the time, mostly because of this. Later, because you stated orally that the Communist Party had no problem with obeying military and political orders, we dared to forward your oral statement and the twelve articles of opinions to the government together. This is also what we want to solemnly state as an aside. This is a special notice. I hope you will consider it and wish you all the best. Respectfully, Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong, August 10th, Year Thirty-Three.</p>
<p>VI. Lin Zuhan's Reply, August 30th, Year Thirty-Three</p>
<p>Respected Mr. Xueting and Wenbai: After receiving your letter of August 10th, which replied to our party's twelve articles of opinions, I immediately telegraphed it to Yan'an. There were many errors in the telegraph codes sent back and forth, and it took some time to correct them. Now, I am conveying the opinions that our party's Central Committee ordered me to reply to. Please forward them to Chairman Chiang and your party's Central Committee again.</p>
<p>(1) Your letter states that the government's proposed plan has been given to the Communist Party for more than two months, but "no concrete reply has been obtained from the Communist Party," which is "beyond your expectations," and that this proposed plan has been able to "largely accommodate" the opinions of the Communist Party, which seems to contain the meaning of blaming our side for unreasonable delays. It should be stated that this is completely inconsistent with the facts and a wrong view. Because I have stated in several talks that the government's proposed plan is too far apart in principle from the twelve written articles and eight oral articles proposed by our party and cannot be accepted. For example, in the government's proposed plan: (1) It does not mention a word about the implementation of democratic politics, the recognition of the legality of various parties, the release of patriotic political prisoners, and the release of arrested personnel such as Ye Ting, which we urgently request to be resolved. (2) It only recognizes the number of troops to be organized as four armies and ten divisions, and regardless of the needs and the war environment in the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines, it wants to "cancel within a time limit" the hundreds of thousands of troops who are fighting the war outside the ten divisions, and wants to "concentrate the use" of the ten divisions. (3) It only requires the border region government to implement the laws and decrees of the Kuomintang Central Government, and does not mention the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and does not recognize the various democratic facilities and democratic laws that have been implemented and have achieved great success as needed for the War of Resistance. (4) It requires the abolition of all democratic governments elected by the people in all base areas. Because the distance between the opinions of the two parties is so different, our party's Central Committee is still unwilling to stop or break down the negotiations, and has ordered me to invite you to Yan'an to discuss changes, and to report the negotiations to find a way to continue the negotiations, so that the problems can be finally solved under the principles that are conducive to the War of Resistance and unity, and conducive to the promotion of democracy. You have already stated that you are asking for instructions on the trip to Yan'an, and I hope it can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on national political issues and the relationship between the two parties did not start with this negotiation between me and you. Since the peaceful settlement of the Xi'an Incident, the Communist Party has been constantly suggesting to the Kuomintang that only by immediately implementing democracy and implementing the revolutionary Three Principles of the People put forward by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the First National Congress of the Kuomintang can the strength of unity and resistance be enhanced. Only by following the democratic path can the Kuomintang-Communist relationship and all other domestic political issues be resolved fairly and reasonably. We support unity, and we support unity based on democracy. We support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the National Government, and we ask him to resolutely resist the war and implement the Three Principles of the People. This is not only the request of the Communist Party, but also the request of 99% of the people of the country. In order to seek the Kuomintang Central Government to accept the suggestions of our party and the requests of the vast majority of people across the country, the Communist Party put forward a guarantee to implement the Four Pledges in its declaration on September 22, 1937. Over the past eight years, we have completely implemented these four pledges and have adhered to them to this day. There are sufficient facts to prove this. In his speech at the memorial meeting for the 19th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Yan'an on March 12 this year, our party comrade Zhou Enlai has talked about this in detail and can be referred to. Over the past eight years, the Central Committee of our party has also constantly sent me and comrades Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lin Biao to patiently request the Kuomintang Central Government to resolve national political issues and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Comrades Zhou and Dong have been stationed in Chongqing for several years, but they have never achieved results. Where is the obstacle to the fundamental solution of the problem? It must be pointed out that it is because the views of the Kuomintang Central Government and our views and the views of the vast majority of people across the country have a great distance. The government officials in charge have always been unwilling to immediately implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the democratic system that can unite all parties and all levels of combat power across the country. This is the real reason why the current negotiations are so far apart.</p>
<p>(3) We hope that the Kuomintang Central Government will put the interests of the entire country and nation first in resolving national government issues and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and not put the private interests of one party, one faction, and one person first. We should start from the viewpoint of being conducive to national unity and resistance, and conducive to promoting democracy, and not from the policy of maintaining the rule of one party, so that the negotiations between the two sides can be easily approached, and all issues can be resolved fairly and reasonably. However, the government's proposed plan and your letter of August 10th unfortunately do not meet this expectation. For example, (1) regarding the issue of the national political system, the three requirements we put forward, (1) Please the government implement democratic politics and guarantee the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom, (2) Recognize the legal status of the Central Government and various patriotic parties, and release patriotic political prisoners, (3) Implement local autonomy that is worthy of the name, are precisely a reflection of the most urgent demands of the people across the country today, and are precisely the measures that must be implemented immediately to unite the forces of the country and earnestly prepare for the counter-offensive. If this can be done, it will not only benefit the entire country and nation, but also benefit the Kuomintang. However, your letter still insists on the "established policy of the Central Government," which is to implement constitutional governance and democracy only after the War of Resistance, and criticizes the democratic requirements we put forward as "abstract sentences with no boundaries," believing that they are of no benefit to the facts and "only increase disputes in the future." But according to our experience, in our difficult and arduous environment, the people can still conduct universal elections, discuss state affairs, elect democratic governments, and implement local autonomy. There is no reason why the great rear cannot implement democratic politics. Therefore, all problems depend on whether the Kuomintang has the determination and sincerity to implement democratic politics. If it does, it should implement constitutional governance immediately during the War of Resistance, rather than postpone it until after the War of Resistance. (2) Regarding the organization, defense area, salary and equipment of the 477,000 regular troops led by the Communist Party, if we look at the past combat performance of this army and the needs of preparing for the counter-offensive today, it has persisted and developed three major battlefields (North China, Central China, South China) in the extraordinarily difficult combat environment over the past eight years, established many strong combat base areas, liberated more than 88 million people, organized more than 2.2 million militias, and became the vanguard of the general counter-offensive in the future. In order to prepare for the needs of the counter-offensive, the government should reward him, equip him, and strengthen him. First of all, he should be fully recognized, which is more reasonable. In our proposal, we requested the government to "organize into sixteen armies and forty-seven divisions, and at least give the designations of five countries and sixteen divisions at present," in order to make the negotiations easier to approach. Regarding the defense area, maintaining the status quo during the war, and requesting a fair and reasonable distribution of Allied aid to China, etc., are all suitable for combat needs and are not objectionable. However, the government's proposed plan's "cancellation within a time limit" and "concentrated use within a time limit" methods failed to take into account the needs of combat and the environment of guerrilla warfare. Your letter of August 10th emphasizes opposition to the "independent expansion of troops" by the commanding officers and opposition to maintaining the status quo of the defense area of the troops, and accuses us of not following the unity of military orders. However, you have just overlooked a truth that ordinary people understand, which is that today our China is in the War of Resistance. If we oppose the development of people's combat forces, or attempt to weaken or destroy this combat force, and want to make the people's combat forces leave the area, all of this will objectively become favorable to the enemy. (3) Today, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and the elected governments in various base areas in North China, Central China, and South China are fully implementing the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. Persisting in the War of Resistance is implementing nationalism. The War of Resistance regime is completely democratic in nature. In our various anti-Japanese base areas... all people and anti-Japanese groups enjoy all freedoms and rights, and exercise direct democracy, and organize local governments with a three-thirds system. We also implement policies such as labor mutual assistance production, frugality, disaster relief, land reclamation, rent reduction, interest reduction, streamlining troops and simplifying administration, popularizing education, supporting the government and loving the people, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the anti-Japanese war, reducing the burden on the people, and improving the lives of workers and peasants, which are all in line with the principles of people's livelihood. Because we thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People in the border areas and various combat base areas, we can unite all the people, overcome all difficulties, persist in the War of Resistance for a long time, and have the strength to counter-attack. Such a democratic government should be recognized as a legal local government, and should be given the right to local autonomy. The various democratic facilities and democratic laws of this kind of government that have been implemented and have been very successful should be rewarded and promoted, and promoted throughout the country. This is the attitude that the Central Government of the Kuomintang, which truly adheres to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People, should take. However, the government's proposed plan and your letter of August 10th only seek to implement the laws and decrees of the Kuomintang Central Government in the border region government, and require the abolition of the elected governments and various democratic facilities that are beneficial to combat in various base areas, which is also unfavorable to the needs of combat today.</p>
<p>(4) In short, according to the current situation, to win the final victory, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must unite, and the problems existing between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must be resolved as soon as possible. This solution can only be achieved by the Kuomintang officials in charge immediately implementing democratic politics and resolving the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fairly and reasonably from the democratic path. Only in this way can we enhance the national unity and combat power, can everything be on the right track, can we stop the current enemy offensive, cooperate with the future comprehensive counter-offensive, and can we establish domestic peace and cooperation, and international peace and cooperation after the war. We communists hope with great enthusiasm that the Kuomintang officials in charge will quickly change their old government on the basis of democracy and unity, so as to open up the current political deadlock and complete the sacred cause jointly expected by the Allied countries. We here have absolutely no intention of taking advantage of the Kuomintang's unfavorable situation to put forward any excessive demands, and even more so, we have no intention of taking advantage of the Kuomintang's difficult situation to delay and unwilling to solve the problem. (Some ignorant people are spreading such rumors) All the propositions are for the purpose of winning the victory of the entire nation in the War of Resistance, which must be realized. We are loving and helping the Kuomintang to progress, rather than sitting idly by and watching the Kuomintang's difficulties. Genggeng's loyal words will be appreciated by the Kuomintang's enlightened people. I hope you will forward the above opinions to Chairman Chiang and your party's Central Committee again. Time is running out, I hope you will make a decision soon. We communists have always faithfully implemented the Four Pledges, faithfully implemented the Three Principles of the People, adhered to the policy of democratic unity and political resolution, and looked forward to the reply from the Central Government of the Kuomintang. The invitation to you to go to Yan'an to continue negotiations, which was proposed by our party's Central Committee, not only expresses our party's sincerity in not wanting to break down the negotiations, but also wants the important responsible personnel of the Kuomintang Central Government to personally go to the border area to see how faithfully we are implementing the Four Pledges and thoroughly implementing the Three Principles of the People. The various constructions of our border areas and various base areas can be used as a reference for the implementation of democracy throughout the country. I think this will make it easier for the negotiations between the two sides to be resolved. I don't know if you have agreed with the government and your party's Central Committee on this matter? I hope to reply soon, and I pay tribute to Xunqi.</p>
