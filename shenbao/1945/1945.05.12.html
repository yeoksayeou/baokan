<h3>特設空母及戰巡艦等　續擊沉毀十七艘　殺傷人員一萬二千六百名</h3>
<p>日大本營發表　冲繩島戰果</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午四時三十分發表：　沖繩本島南部地區之敵第　一綫，五月十日在我謝·幸地·前出·安謝之綫，反覆向日軍陳地攻擊中﹐經該處日軍部隊繼續對之邀擊。在該地區自四月二十九日以來，日方所獲戰果﹐載至五月二日晚止，業經確認者如次：殺傷敵人員一萬二千六百人，擱置焚毀戰車一百三十四輛，破壞各種火砲三十九門。　日航空部隊及潛水部隊，其後賡續攻擊冲繩本島之敵飛行基地及本島附近之敵艦船與機動部隊﹐自五月六日以來，日方所獲戰果，至今被判明者如次﹕擊沉特設航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，運轍船一艘，潛水艦一艘，艦種不詳者一艘。擊毀特設航空母襤三艘，運輸船一艘﹐艦種不詳者五艘，燃燒起火者二十五處以上﹐參加以上攻擊之航空部隊﹐大部份係屬特別攻擊隊。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日特別攻擊隊，十日拂曉於　良間列島附近海面，攻擊敵大型特設空母一隻，當起大火焚燒。</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　　關島電﹐美太平洋艦隊司令部本日公報稱：琉球羣島美軍在主力艦及巡洋艦協助下，轟擊日軍南部陣綫之設施﹐昨繼續推進一，美軍於琉球島一役，迄今已死陸軍二一〇七人，海軍陸戰隊五五七人，傷陸軍一〇四〇二人，海軍陸戰隊二八〇〇人，失蹤者共五百餘人。</p>
<h3>南部及西海岸　展開激戰中</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　敵軍自四月二十六日對沖繩本島南部戰綫展開第二次總攻以來﹐因日軍果敢之邀擊，致流血甚多﹐至四月末，敵之企圖即受挫，然敵之戰意仍舊旺盛。入五月，敵獲得全員資材之增援後，即圖突破苜里北方之日軍陣綫，而反覆展開熾烈攻擊，緣敵因受日空軍之連續攻擊，致令其海上勢力襲受重創，然彼等爲確保能以獲得海上補給之目前之戰略優勢地位，乃不惜次量增援兵員與資材，以謀於短期內擊毀日軍之反擊力。同時，俟歐戰終了後，欲藉冲繩作戰向前推進之機，而對中外散布於大東戰爭中美軍作戰之順利進展之印象﹐故敵之攻勢，於九日晨以來，愈形激烈化。十日晨，敵有力部隊，於戰車之掩護下﹐自首里南方前而之前田南方及安波茶方面來攻﹐斯時，日守軍當即與之展開激戰，同時，敵於西海岸方而亦展開攻勢，十日午前六時許，敵於戰略要點安謝村（那覇北方三公里）前面之安謝川開始渡河戰，而以舟艇約四十艘來攻﹐至七時半，敵因受日守軍之痛擊，卒遭擊退。繼繼於十一時三十分許，敵於猛烈之砲火掩護下，動員水陸面用戰車﹐再度開始在安謝川之渡河作戰，刻雙方正於安謝村東西兩綫展開激戰中。因之，日美兩軍十日於南部戰綫之對峙戰，係自東海岸方面之我謝起，經辛地前田至西海岸之安謝，長約八公里之戰綫，目前雙方正反覆展開激戰中。</p>
<p>日軍綜合戰果</p>
<p>又自敵軍登陸以來，至敵軍二度攻勢受挫之四月二十九日止，日軍所獲之戰果如下：斃敵二萬二千一百名，擱挫焚毀戰車三百二十五輛，破壞各種大砲一百零二門，其後至五月七日止之九日間，日軍於戰門中，所獲之確認戰果爲斃敵一萬二千六百名，擱挫及焚毀戰車一百三十四輛，破壞各種火砲三十九門，若統計敵軍登陸以來，日軍於陸上所獲之戰果為斃敵三萬四千七百名﹐擱挫及焚毀戰車四百五十九輛，破壞各種火砲一百四十門，總計敵之登陸兵力，已喪失其三分之一矣。自九日敵軍開始新攻勢以來，彼等於地利人和，皆經日軍防禦綫之猛烈反攻前，將愈形增加其出血量也。又天氣好轉後，日特攻隊，航空部隊及潛水艇，對於本島周圍敵艦船及飛機塲之果敢攻擊，當可充分發揮其威力矣。九日薄暮﹐由陸上確認敵艦艇因進受日特攻機之猛攻，致被擊沉潛水艇一艘及巡洋艦一艘，同時並有艦型不詳者二艘被擊毀燃燒。</p>
<h3>蔡駐日大使　昨晉宮拜謁</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　我駐日大使蔡培，因近將返國，十一日上午十時三十分　進宮拜謁日天皇陛下，蒙於鳳凰間賜見，大使繼又謁見日皇后陛下。</p>
<h3>日駐越大使　奉召返東京</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日本駐越南大使松本氏，以東鄉外相之電召，十一日上午九時抵此。</p>
<h3>冲繩沉毀敵艦船　累計達五一五艘</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　迄本月十日晨止﹐日軍於冲繩方面已査明之戰果﹐做根據日大本營發表者，沉毀敵艦船實已達五百十五艘之多數，其內容如下：</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>江蘇省與上海市之關係</h3>
<p>上海爲特別市，但從大體上言﹐實爲江蘇全省之心臟部分﹐在軍事﹐政治，經濟，文化諸方面，上海之一切動靜﹐都足以影響江蘇全省乃至華中全區·所以，治理蘇省，必須從上海着眼和下手；而治理上海，亦必須從江蘇全省着眼和下手。省與特別市之區劃是形式上的，在實際上決不能存畛域之見。月前任省長蒞滬之時﹐在本市各界歡迎席上發言，及與社會各界領袖之會談，都能洞鑒省市之密切關係，而有種種賢明見解，尤於今日上海亟待解決的種種具體間題﹐都能依據這種認識而慨然有風雨共濟的決心，實在値得讚揚。</p>
<p>目前上海市急待舉辦的事業雖多，但最主要的﹐第一是戰時人口疏散之實施，第二是上海工業之向蘇省各地分別發展，第三是農業貸款之舉辦，第四是蘇滬公路之興修等等。這幾件事，直接爲上海急待解决的問題，間接又與蘇省政治，經濟密切相關，所以雙方都不應稍有畛域之見﹐都要作自己分內之事，認眞地積極地推進。</p>
<p>首就人口疏散問題而論﹐自舉辦以來，雖經蘇省當局與上海負責方面之協力，但尚未獲得成效，人口過剩現象，依然嚴重，若不積極推進疏散，一且空襲肆虐﹐無謂犧牲，殊不値得。且上海之大量勞動力，能作有計劃的疏散至蘇省各地，協助全省之開發建設事業，亦有重大意義。但問題所在之交通運輸地方治安給養等﹐皆須蘇滬負責當局有更積極和密切的合作。</p>
<p>次就工業疏散而論，今日上海各項工業﹐以電力燃料原料諸問題，無法開工，陷於停頓，多數廠商，已因開支日增﹐維持爲難，或以減資，或以裁員辦法，苟延殘喘。失業者日衆，而社會之危機日甚。如上海陷入戰爭環境，則玉石俱焚，恢復非易。所以上海企業家應勿存觀望，當機立斷，向蘇省各地設法作化整爲零之計。而上海工廠在省境各地復工，則各小市鎭之繁榮﹐可立而待，將來不難有新工業區出現﹐故省政當局，尤當積極對上海工業界作有力的協助。</p>
<p>至於農業貸款，直接可以挽救蘇省農村之衰落﹐進而增進農村復興實力﹔同時對於上海，則大量游資歸鄉之後，自可減少投機囤積之現象，而使金融及經濟界漸復正常。若農業貸款辦理得宜，結果更可消除都市及農村的社會及政治危機﹐使從旁窺伺的共黨無法推展其活動力﹐尤有一舉數得之利。但成功之决定，有賴於滬市與蘇省問之密切合作。</p>
<p>江蘇與上海之關係，僅從上述數點，已可概見。此數種事業，現在都已着手，正待蘇省當局與上海方面之合作推進。今天上海工商界代表，由袁履登·陳日平兩先生爲團長副團長﹐組織蘇省訪問團，前往蘇省玫察，並與省當局商談﹐即以上述數事爲中心﹐我們敬祝該團成功，亦即省市雙方利益的成就。地方通</p>
<h3>訊蚌埠風景</h3>
<p>— 谷戈</p>
<p>蚌埠是淮河之演﹐津浦鐵路南段上的一個小鎭，在津浦路沒築的時候，本祗是個幾十戶人家的小村落，到鐵路築成，因爲他的地位恰處於南北的衝要，才漸漸的繁盛起來﹐以至於今日，有只知道蚌埠，反不曉得鳳陽縣政府原來也設在蚌埠街上呢！</p>
<p>蚌埠地處皖北，可是離着江南也不遠，所以在這裏固可看見滿含北方風味的騾車和牛車﹐以及斜扣着衣襟﹐臉上流着黑色的汗，緊張地邪許趕着牲口的「老侉」﹔可也瞧得見淮河裏蝟集着的船艦，大貨船，小漁船，淸秀的漁女，傴僂的漁翁……蚌埠—不﹐鳳陽人帶着北方人的樸直與豪爽﹐却也隱藏着江南人謙和的性格﹐可是近年來，隨着洋貨，也從列車運來不少浮誇和狡猾了。</p>
<p>蚌埠有三異。三異云何？一曰男人多，因爲是省政府所在地，機關林立，加之客商往來很多，所以獨多的單身漢﹐馬路上碰來碰去的是男人，而且多半是掛着徽章的，故「三人行﹐必有吾「官」也」，誠非虛語！二日沒有茶館，茶館是我國的國粹之一﹐早已不用多說﹐在我到過的幾處地方，無論大江南北，即使小鎮大莊都有茶館點綴着的，可是在這堂堂的安徽省府所在地却沒有，跑遍蚌埠也找不出！三曰鼠龍式的錢莊，這還是戰後興起的﹐爲了南北幣制的不同，而蚌埠成爲交換貨幣的地點，北方的旅客須在這裏下車換好中儲劵往南，甫方的也必須在這裏換好聯銀券，這種錢莊集中在車站。二馬路國貨路一帶，名曰錢莊，其實簡單得很，祗要一尺多立方的鐵絲籠一隻，圖頗方趾的同胞一位，就可交易了，此種「　籠」少說也有幾十隻﹐雖似渺小，却對蚌埠的金融有不小決定的作用呢！</p>
<p>蚌埠最熱鬧的是二馬路，各種店舖都有﹐銀樓也有六七　，而且馬路還是柏油舖的—至於其餘的街道，則全是「本來面目」的泥地﹐這裏的泥又特別黏，祗一下雨，和了水的泥馬上成爲薄漿浮了起來，一脚踏進去，起碼陷進半隻鞋深，這泥封住在鞋上﹐乾了還硬得古怪，要大半天才刮得掉。</p>
<p>西風一去，春到人間了﹐可是蚌埠沒有春天，在鎭上，我們雖然覺得出天氣暖和了，可是春的感覺—却沒有。因爲僅有的一點春光﹐也全給關在豪富們的巨厦裹了，除了這幾個「　」外，整個錢上很難找得出一棵放靑的楊柳﹐或半株野草閒花來，至於郊外﹐除了綠油油的小麥田外，祗望得到一片無涯的黃土，和止水似不大流動的淮河眞的黃水，黃的大圩，黃的村莊……在遠處偶或也有一兩處荒山，可是非但說不出什麽美麗，雄偉，反更顯得四周的更荒蕪罷了，鎭南也有個略具點綴的小南山，可是說他是山，倒不如呌他邱吧。</p>
<p>可是蚌埠的文化情形還要荒蕪呢，商務·中華·開明·世界等大書店都有分店，營業以文具敎科書爲主，報紙只安徽日報一家，日出半張，特稿欄大都轉載滬報﹐副刋「大地」篇幅極小﹐圖書館有一所﹐算是省立的呢，書却省得可憐，恐怕還不滿一千本罷。</p>
<p>娛樂塲有電影院一家，做京戯的一家，做蹦蹦戯的一家﹐話劃方面以前曾有徐莘園的班子來演過他的「傑作」，賣座好像還可以，不久前還都紀念﹐新運會又假座東方電影院出演話劇，是洪謨的「關第光臨」﹐導演是報上說有十年幹戯經騐的吳琦，演員包括南京請來的「已成」演員及年靑的「官」們，舞臺條件則燈光，佈景，道具一樣也不齊全﹐演出成績自難背求，第一天速軍警學生在內算賣了個滿座，可是第一幕第二塲就有人開始溜，戯沒演一半，人倒跑了一半，從開　至幕，喝側采之掌聲不絕，第二天演員陣容重新調整，又重排過，成績確已好不少，而且絕沒敢喝倒采的，因為憲兵諭令，一槪不准喝倒采，於是觀衆都變得戰戰兢兢﹐速看到眞好笑處大聲笑也不敢了，這倒是頗為幽默的！</p>
<p>至於作為「文化的象徵」的娼妓﹐當然也有，而且還有「娼妓訓練班」，凡娼妓都得云受訓三月，期滿就被承認為「正式」娼妓了。</p>
<p>蚌埠的物價大致和內地各城市一樣，土產廉而洋貨貴，米價在四萬左右，肉類四五百一斤，蔬菜等物都較上海便宜一半有餘，雖然如此﹐但拿着太低的死薪工的低級公務員，挾衣服上典當的也多的是。</p>
<p>蚌埠的法耙特別嚴明，車站滑不到黑市，街道上警察沒有勒索，貪私枉法的也比旁的地方少得多，上海人到蚌埠來覺得　目一凉，這是蚌埠人值得驕傲的地方。</p>
<p>最後談一談這條撒潑成性的淮河罷，河離蚌鎭一里，有兩道壩擋着﹐在這三四月裏立在壩上，望過去是那樣寗靜的一片黃水，時或能雲見一兩隻掛着滿帆的小船，或三五個　夫用力捐着的沉黨的貨船……可是等到洪澤湖要泛濫時什麼壕都擋不住這黃水的威勢，只要稱上點年紀的鳳陽人，大約都測歷歷道出這裏幾次可怖的大水災來罷！……</p>
<p>「說鳳陽﹐道鳳陽，鳳陽本是好地方，自從出了朱皇帝﹐十年倒有九年荒。」這篇通訊就在這裏打住。</p>

<h3>五團體昨茶會　歡迎丁省長　到五百餘人情緒熱烈</h3>

<p>茶會情形</p>
<p>茶會開始，由主席團主席袁履登李思浩兩氏相繼致詞歡迎，繼請丁省長致詞。旋由紹興旅滬七縣同鄉會代表黃嗣齋演說，末全體進用　點，至下午五時半，始盡歡而散。茲將各氏演詞錄後：</p>
<p>袁履登詞</p>
<p>主席團主席袁履登致歡迎詞如此：「今天我們寗涉及紹興旅滬同鄉會參加歡迎丁省長茶會﹐因爲丁省長即將赴主政浙江之任，担任我們的地方長官，可以格外感覺興奮。同時我們在形式雖則僅僅代表寗波與紹興同鄉，又是，實際上我們的內心是代表全浙江的同鄉的，所以格外感覺熱烈。丁省長和我們相識已久，過去在社會福利部長任內，常常接觸，對於丁省長的才具與精細，早巳很佩服了。浙江在目前的和平區內地位極爲重要，而寗紹一帶地方治安，以及可能引起大陸戰爭的形勢，更爲重要，丁省長同時兼綰軍事，任務自然更見艱鉅。我們深盼善爲運用其精細的才具，得能確保治安，化險爲夷。至於刷新省政，澤惠浙民，深信必能實現浙入的期待，敬祝勢力成功。」</p>
<p>李思浩詞</p>
<p>主席團主席李思浩致歡迎詞如此：「今天五團體歡迎丁省長，我們代表上海慈善團體參加，很爲榮幸。丁省長前在社會福利部長任內，是我們慈善團體的主管長官﹐對於上海慈善團體﹐多方指導，多方協助，得到許多實惠。記得去年丁夫人華誕，各方慶賀，丁部長以賀　完全充作善舉，分配京滬各慈善團體，眞正做到以身作則，愛護慈善事業。因此，現在丁省長調主浙江省政，在我們慈善團體的立塲，頗有不勝惜別之意，尚望丁省長不　在遠，隨時指教，繼續協助。同時，目前上海正在籌備疏散，而慈善團體，尤在百先疏散之列，如浙省境內有適當地方，更盼丁省長特別留意帮助。今天我們一面表示惜別與感謝之忱，一面表示歡迎與期待之意，敬祝光明與健康。」</p>
<p>丁盛長詞</p>
<p>丁省長致詞如此：「今天承上海市各旅滬各同鄉集會歡迎，本八非常榮幸，非常感謝。剛繼聽到袁嚴登李思浩先生致詞，對本人過去工作謬承贊揚，殊感慚愧，對今後工作，尤多期望，更覺不安。默邨此次奉命調任浙江，雖在環境上與職務上，與過去任職社會福利部時期，已有不同，但其目的則並無異樣。蓋本人之目的，亦惟忠心服務於社會而已。自民國二十八年和運開始，民國二十九年國府還都，以迄於今，本人所做的工作從未離開過「社會」兩字，無論中央社會部也好，行政院社會部也好，以至於社會運動指揮委員會，社會　利部，機構名稱從然不同，而工作月祭還是一貫的，即「服務社會」，造福人羣而已。</p>
<p>此次奉命調任浙江，在區域上，職權上，與過去當然有了很大的變動，但與本人一貫的「服務社會」「造福人羣」的宗旨，則可說絲毫沒有變動的；所不同者，即是過去所負的是聲個空間中的局部的責任﹐而今後所負的是局部空間中的整個的責任。無論其空間怎樣，部份怎樣﹐而爲政者應當爲社會服務，爲人羣造福，這是天經地義的。默邨在過去社會福利部時期，顧因社會福利部是中國新設的行政機構，一切都要從根造起，幸賴各界協力，已經建就了相當的基礎，尤其上海各界領袖·對社會福利部的工作，協力甚多。今日本人雖已離開社會福利部，但對上海各界的努力，永遠表示感謝的。此次調任浙江，浙灑相離甚近，浙江在滬同鄉甚多，故一切政治·經濟·文化之關　亦極多。本人希效上海各界領袖及浙省同鄉今後仍和從前一樣加以協助，並予督促。汪故主席在去年元旦訓示國人，應以確立治安，安定民生，作最低限度之努力。</p>
<p>浙省建政以來，已逾五年，經傅項兩省長之努力，已達確立活安，安定民生之境地。本人此次赴浙，祈求確保治安，改善民生，在此兩大原則下，以貫澈本人服務社會造福人軍之素旨。但欲求確保治安，必先改善民生，民生不能改善，則治安亦無從確保；而欲改善民生，尤必須從增加生產﹐流通產資着手；欲求增加生產流通物資，則更須上海經濟界之協力。浙江旅滬同鄉在上海經濟界中是向來佔有雄厚的力量，故希望各位浙江旅滬同鄉爲愛護桑梓起見，最好分一部份力量回浙江去。</p>
<p>關於本人主持浙政有兩點可以告訴諸位的：第一是人事方面，絕對以錄用浙江同鄉爲原則。第二是民意與政府當局之溝通，今後擬加以注意。並擬仿照上海辦法，設立諮詢委員會，藉以溝通官民意見，並以表示省政公開，各位同鄉如有適當人選，請　管推　﹐共謀　　福利。」</p>
<p>黃雨齊詞</p>
<p>略謂：「今日本人滬同鄉會名委參加，不但本人稱幸，即紹興七縣旅滬同鄉亦深感光榮。方才在袁履登·李思浩兩主席致詞期待之下，又獲聆丁省長指示，更有深切明瞭。丁省畏此次長浙﹐對我寗紹以及浙全省同鄉所負責任　重，我人當至誠協力，丁省長指示之以浙人襄治浙省，我人更十二萬分感激。過去傳省長在任時，關注民間痛苦，並特召集旅滬同鄉懇談，以孚我同鄉之期望。今次丁省長長政，處理統盤大計，精神所至，定有光明成果，更望丁省畏到任後，愛民如子，盡力保護，平靖地方，最後恭祝丁省畏政躬康泰。」</p>

<p>主席訓詞</p>
<p>國府陳代主席兼軍事委員會委員長訓詞，略謂：諸位來賓長官學生，今日本人由京來滬，參加中央海軍軍官學校第四期學生畢業典禮，非常欣慰。今天各位同學畢業，最要者應明瞭政府之政策，換言之，吾人要奉行國策，以先德理之三民主義，大亞洲主義爲出發點，以和平爭取國家之自由，以反共來求國內的統一，再以建國爭取國家之獨立。現在時局日趨緊張，政府參加大東亞戰爭之意義，此乃國府成立之最初目的，亦係國府第一次在廣州成立之目的﹐爲取消不平等條約﹐爭取平等獨立及整個民族自由解放，聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，此爲國府參戰之最高目的，成敗利鈍，在所不計。現在國府要求自由，獨立和統一，這一點，應特別注意，並須澈底了解。我國海軍欲在物質方面，求其滿足，雖非易事，但海陸空軍均有其共同之條件，政府是有統盤之籌劃。希望諸位畢業之後，努力研究，準備最新知識，復興中國海軍，無論物質條件，如何缺乏，時局怎樣迫切，吾人應當加强努力於海軍﹐使我國海軍擴展起來，此爲本人對我國海軍前途及諸位本身建設之期望。</p>

<h3>蘇省計劃修建　蘇滬公路</h3>
<p>蘇滬公路即穌崑路與崑滬路相連而成，爲蘇省與滬市交通重要幹綫﹐事變以來，所有橋樑路面損毀頗甚，扳以公路交通運輸益增重要，爰經蘇省建設應廳長兼建設總工程處處長孫育才副處長許英，秉承任省長意旨，前月派員詳密查勘，計劃興建。該路在穌省境內者，計全長五十七公里，路寬七·五公尺，原有煤層路面寬五·五公尺，橋樑計七十六座（包括省市分界之顧浦橋在內），除二十四座業經塡塞外，計有半永久式橋楔六座，臨時式木橋四十六座。茲經該處擬具修理計劃如下：　橋樑工稈將原有各橋樑，寬度在四公尺以下者，一律改爲四公尺，以利行車，其載重量凡在六公噸以下者，一律改正至使能通行六公噸車輛爲原則。關於業已損壞之橋樑，如於水道交通及農田灌溉無礙者，均予塡塞，以資節省修理費用。　路面工程以就地取材爲原則，損壤特重部伶加做碎石或碎磚路基，務使堅實平整，並加舖四·五公尺寬二·五公分厚爛石砂路面，並修正路拱，全部橋楔路面工程經費約需兩萬萬元。整個計劃業由該處呈奉省長批准，現正積極籌備開工，該處現將全部工程分爲路面及橋樑各兩標，刋登蘇滬各報招商投標，並定於本月十五日在該處大禮堂當衆開標，以資早日興工。</p>
<h3>徐建設局長報告　各項建設近況　出席記者例會答問</h3>
<p>市宜傳處主持之記者例會，於昨（十一）日上午十時半在市府會議廳舉行，請由市建設局長徐季敦發表最近本市各項建設狀况，徐局長特就最近施政修築公路等諸問題，闡明　詳，最後又發表此次視察該局各附屬機關之感想。茲特分誌如次；</p>
<p>最近施政</p>
<p>建設局最近施政概况如何？（答）可分下述數點而言：第一，自本市公用工務兩局合併爲建設局後，即將公用，工　兩局局關分科辦理，過去兩局之附屬機關，亦經次第調整，分區進行合併，再予分組，此爲試辦性質。第二，公用工務兩局原有工人，自合併後，共有三千人，過去由於散漫之故，經逐漸裁撤，至今已減爲二千人，均予相當管理﹐以發揮工作效能。第三，過去倉庫材料充實，自大東亞戰爭發生後，原料來源不易﹐購辦困難，致堆庫材料，陸續用罄，最近本局企劃添購補充。第四，車輛檢騐，由於物資缺乏，顧全申請者之困難，在檢　標準上較低，惟對於危害公共妨礙交通，及有肇禍危險之各種車輛﹐則一概嚴禁駛行。第五，重新調整汽車牌照，以示統一，刻正積極整理，將來各車照擬添漆「滬」字，以資識別。第六，碼頭管理，過去碼頭秩序，混亂異常，無業流氓盤踞，乘機勒索，爲害行旅，終以管理機關尤多，管理上障礙重重，本局爲求統一指揮起見，擬集有關機關成立碼頭管理委員會，以期改善，各種章則正在草擬中。第七，積極辦理各種統計工作，俾便易於瞭然。</p>
<p>修築公路</p>
<p>修築公路工程推進情形可否見告一二？（答）關於修築公路，在本局最近施政上最感重耍，當前築路工程則將開始，主要者爲蘇滬公路之修築，本市方面担任由滬至顧浦橋一段，計約二十六公里。該橋以西則歸蘇省負責，該段工程，共分三段辦理，每段並設段畏一人，在規定界限從事工作，刻正丈量劃界。本段路程載電標準爲十公噸﹐該路將來可通南京。同時對滬杭公路之修築，亦正計劃進行中。首先開始修築上海至松江一段，浙江省方面，刻亦派員視察計劃中。此外對於北西藏路至北站路面，亦正計劃辦理。市區以內馬路，不久即可開始修築。</p>
<p>申請建築工程及其他執照手續，似欠迅速，貴局擬如何改進？（答）由於向有陽各局之連絡，及派員視察調查種種工作之繁複，發照時期，至遲需要一星期，絕不故意留難，如本局職員有故意及勒索情事，儘可隨時告發澈究。</p>
<p>兩路近況</p>
<p>上川上南兩路及市輪渡經營狀况如何？（答）第一，關於上用上南兩路營狀况，最近頗爲良好，過去市府對該兩路以自給自足爲原則，以維開支，至最近不但能自足，且每月有盈餘，解繳市金庫，其數額約千萬元以上。兩路鐵軌枕木及客車座位，均經修理，更換一新，不論軍警公務人員重車，均一律購票﹐兩路每月總共收入約有五六千萬元之譜。第二市輪渡經營狀况，去年上半年度尚好，盈餘三十餘萬元，至去年下半年度，由於燃料及船隻路程之關係，以及職工薪津增加﹐開支龐大，乃將上半年盈餘　蝕﹐且尚　十餘萬元，而至去年度營業又告好轉，可彌補此項歸投，並可盈餘若干。</p>
<p>視察感想</p>
<p>貴局長曾先後視察各附屬機關有何感想？（答）本人此次視察，由於時間所限，僅巡視三分之二。此次動機，其一爲視察倉庫材料，其二爲視察車輛登記有否流　情本，此行結果，在大體上言，今後可應改各點：第一，積極强化人事管理，　精取才，分別派用專門技術人員。第二，計劃材料補充，及整理損壞廠舍。</p>

<h3>日陸相阿南大將</h3>
<p>— 高垣金三郎</p>
<p>『道德及情義乃戰爭力量。』這是阿南大將的一向主張。</p>
<p>作戰要務令的綱領中，「配合一致爲達到戰鬥目的之最重要者…」﹐這固然是强調配合作戰的重要牲﹐然而許多部隊的配合作戰，尤其是大軍團的用兵作戰，各個兵團及軍團的道德以及情義心是最重要的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的起初，將軍在某戰綫上受命與酒并隆中將的華南軍配合進攻香港作戰。這時候我們日軍雖然一直　向香港，但因另一方面重慶軍企圖擾亂日軍的　後﹐所以當時很有必要牽制重慶軍的企圖，然而當時內種種的條件﹐而進行這一配合作戰非常困難。儘管如此，將軍不顧巴軍莫大犧牲，而以道德及悄義的立塲，爲友軍排除萬難，與以援手。在著名的香港攻略戰背後﹐竟有這樣一段美談。足證曾完成極重要的任務。</p>
<p>此外在華北戰綫和南洋戰綫上，將軍用兵作戰的遺跡上，總刻劃着上述主張的粗綫條。</p>
<p>這一信條，並非將軍的戰術思想，也是他的人生觀，倫理觀之主幹。將軍的德高望重﹐或許是受烈士橘中佐幼年學校時代熏陶所致，但他待人接物，也總是以道德情義爲主。這也許是由日常生活的根本態度中自然產生者。</p>
<p>論劍道，他是五六段的英雄，此外還對射箭，手槍射擊有特別的拿手。將軍在這一方面的信條，就是劍無慮揮主義，彈無虛發主義，在訓練兵士上，他也主張不要我尋許多目標，而要劍一揮則定有一對方應聲而倒，彈一發則定有一對方胸中流血，這就是最好的方針。</p>
<p>不要打小處，最好是採用泰山壓頂式打臉，這種作風也在他工作中表現出來，無諭遇見什麼間題，都先下一輕重的判斷，然後就按照自己的考慮勇往直前。</p>
<p>在負衆望的將軍傍邊，有各式各樣的人發表意見，但有一天﹐有一位將校擔憂世風之日下，非常悲憤地向將軍聲述，此時將軍板眼淸楚地輕輕敲着桌子說﹕</p>
<p>「周太公曰『勿哭』！」</p>
<p>從將軍的嘴裏自然流露出來的這短短的一句話，據說那位將校完全恍然大悟，這足證阿南將軍的氣量過人。</p>
<p>在目前這種情形，敵美轟炸後的殘酷遺跡，固然可以顯示英勇就義的烈士作風，但將軍對於某一個人說：</p>
<p>「一般人往往稱贊櫻花散落時的美麗，是象徵武人的，但並不盡然。櫻花的眞正美麗，並非在於花之一瓣，而正如藤田東湖說的『發而爲萬朶之櫻……』本居宣長說的「晨光氣息的滿山櫻花』的語句﹐是在於滿坑滿谷的盛開。這才是皇國興廢關頭時，大和民族鐵般團結的盛舉姿態，亦不外是大和內心之表現。」</p>
<p>在不久的將來即將發生的日本本土大決戰，這就是以大和民族永遠命運爲注的一大賭博戰。爲爭取這一偉大民族戰爭的勝利，軍政民間是決不容許有對立現象發生的。以眞實總力爲戰爭中心者，爲人和，即一億人民相互間的信賴。</p>
<p>我們對於充滿至誠及魄力的阿南新陸相，是有無限期待的。（譯自四目十三日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日海空特攻隊　敵美數量戰法的尅星</h3>
<p>數量戰法　根本推翻</p>
<p>昔，艦隊航空勢力總不如基地航空兵力强大，但今日敵美已用數量打破了這個舊觀念。他們誇稱數量的多寡決定了這次大戰的一切。正當動量戰法幾被視爲近代戰中確切不移的金科玉律時，突有日本特別攻擊隊出現，根本推翻了這種觀念。特別攻擊隊的攻法﹐並非當做戰術而編出來的，此點我們務須知道。由菲島方面日本陸海軍航空部隊確立的特攻攻法，在此次冲繩決戰中，更具有可以決定國家隆替的重大性質。</p>
<p>打擊敵軍的數量，日軍的特攻攻擊能够繼續到何進，即為冲繩決戰之關鍵。敵美飽當日軍特攻攻擊的滋味﹐是在菲島戰綫。由於日海軍神風特別攻擊隊，陸軍富嶽萬朶兩特別攻擊隊以下各特攻隊的必殺攻擊，敵美迄今絕對相信的數量戰法觀念，也發生了動搖，這是無可否認的。而敵美於此次冲繩決戰中幾乎出動其全部兵力，顯然也將日軍特攻攻擊估計在預算中。這一次，他們出動了一千數百艘的艦船，幾乎動用太平洋艦隊的全力。他們相信有這樣巨大的數量，就是特攻攻擊也無可奈何它了。而日軍則抱着必死必中的信念，不管其量如何，都要擊滅之。因此，沖繩決戰的核心，可說是美國物量信念與日本特攻信念的鬥法，這兩個對立的信念，即爲此次冲繩航參決戰的本質。</p>
<p>準備攻擊徒勞無功</p>
<p>爲預防日軍特攻隊飛機的出擊，敵美於登陸冲繩以前﹐於三月十八。十九兩日，特派其機動部隊攻擊日本九州航空基地羣。是日，出動的艦上機累計達一千五百架。迨廿七。廿八兩日，再度由九州果南方飛來約五百架的艦上戰。其間，目馬里並納基地飛來的B29，於二十七日連續空襲，晝夜累計達二百數十架之多，除攻擊太刀洗飛行塲以外﹐並於瀨戶內海投下機雷，以圖阻礙日軍艦艇出擊。及至三十一日，再以百數十B29攻擊太刀洗及大村飛行塲。經過旬餘的猛烈空襲，敵美以爲日本航空勢力已瀕潰滅，遂於四月一日開始侵入沖繩羣島。可是，敵美的此項準備攻擊﹐結果是徒勞無功。關於此點，觀乎敵美上陸後日空軍連日以數十架乃至數百架的特攻隊猛襲﹐以及日水上特攻艦餘突破其機雷繼而堂堂出擊，亦可明白。</p>
<p>在敵機動部隊與日特攻飛行隊的劇鬥之間，冲　航空決戰遂進入第二階段的決戰期。從六日起開始的日軍空中特攻隊的猛攻，卒使敵美不得不坦白承認「經騐到太平洋戰最大的空襲」，發出「如果這樣繼續兩個星期，我們的沖繩作戰或將成爲失着的悲呼。日特攻飛行隊的活動，即在天氣惡劣的四月八·九·十日三天內，亦未停頓，迨十一日天氣轉佳，又展開了總突擊。其間，準備已久的〇〇水上特攻隊，亦不斷從冲繩不島出擊﹐使敵美掛出「嚴防日軍自殺舟艇」的危險信號。</p>
<p>基地威力絲毫未衰</p>
<p>由於日軍海空雙方的猛攻，以及地上部隊的奮戰，敵軍的損害日益增加，因而焦躁於辭色，故於四月八日派遣艦上機飛往鹿兒島，對特攻基地及市街區加以無差別的轟炸，但日本航空基地羣的威力，絲毫未衰，特攻隊的攻擊反而日見劇烈。</p>
<p>到了十六日，迄今未現其姿態於近海的殘存航空母艦羣，突然出現，再對日軍航空基地展開攻擊。這顯然是敵方畏懼受到更厲害的特攻隊攻擊，因而出此冒險的舉動，以期得更徹底的潰滅。是日出現的敵空母羣，分爲三羣﹐包含航空母艦六艘，可視爲是其殘存機動部隊的全部實力。敵美爲何出動其寶貝似的部隊？自此日的下午起，又從冲繩基地飛來P51·P40·B25·B24等各種戰鬥機轟炸機混合航空隊約二十餘架，猛襲日本航空基地，這是爲了什麽呢？這不是連續兩星期的日軍特攻攻擊已經勝利的徵象嗎？</p>
<p>敵美因焦躁不堪之故﹐遂有此次出擊﹐不惜以其殘存機動部隊孤注一擲﹐殲敵的良機竟由敵方自己造成！敵美的焦躁不安，對於日本正是千載一時的殲敵機會。今日，自冲繩到南九州洋而，日美雙方正各施展渾身解數，苦戰惡鬥。（譯自四月十八日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>冲繩島上　航空决戰</h3>
<p>冲繩作戰開始以來﹐由於日本航空部隊，水上部隊猛攻﹐冲繩本島周圍的敵艦船羣及機動部隊﹐連日蒙受極大的損害，敵美對其已上陸的兵力，不顧犧牲，冒死補給，同時在日本本土和冲繩本島間常以數百架的艦上機張成繩綱，力圖阻擋日本航空部隊的出擊。可是以神風特政隊爲主體的日本航空部隊，以及水上，陸上各部隊，於四月十一日天氣轉佳以後，依然展開極激烈的攻擊，隨處捉住沖繩周圍的敵艦船羣及其陸上部隊，加以很大的打擊。現在，環繞冲繩的戰局，在海陸空三方面均已達到最高潮。</p>
<p>十二日以降，日精說戰鬥機隊沿琉球羣島綫南下，衝破敵艦上機的防綫，展開壯烈的空中決戰。其間，由於特攻隊的連續出擊，對於敵艦船及機動部隊的攻學，愈益擴大，目十二日到十五日止，在明的戰果業已發表，計擊　艦種不詳的敵艦十三艘，其中有一艘是大型艦，很有可能是艘航空母艦。</p>
<p>此次航空決戰的顯著牲格，即為日軍出擊的飛機全是特別攻擊機，在出擊飛機全部消耗的覺悟之下，實行攻學，務求致敵死命。（譯自四月十八日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>冲繩島南部最近形勢團</h3>
<p>冲繩方面戰事，敵方除在冲繩本島四週之伊江島，廢伊滙羣島，津島等列島僑處於登陸地點外，始終　攻繫重點於該島之南部，如那覇，言里，湊用，中間，前田，　手納，中北兩機塲等地，日來該區激戰甚烈。據本月十日日方發表戰果，日本月八日以來，冲　南部敵軍於首里北方之中間，前田及牧淮等地，同時開始猛攻，本因日陸軍據有地勢上之優點益以空軍攻舉隊之協力，使敵軍續遭重大挫敗，是以敵軍企圖在冲圖全面佔領，終成夢想。</p>
<h3>救急與救貧</h3>
<p>— 周邦俊</p>
<p>語云﹕「救急不救貧」。蓋救急限於一時，救貧則無有窮期。蓋所謂救急者，或因資金運用不能活發而需要協助，或偶因急需而不能不向人吿貸；救貧則異是，用途無定，後繼無來源，乞援無終期。職是，救急大半爲積極牲之協助﹐救貧類皆消極牲之輸與。</p>
<p>環顧今日之上海，貧苦羣衆之產生，幾與日俱增，日用物品之高漲，廠商之裁員，均爲製造之因。是以救濟之道，絕非單純的物質與經濟上之支援所能奏效，而在如何弭制禁止裁員，爲消弭制增知貧苦羣衆之主要對策，實際上物資缺乏，動力限制，縱有大力，亦無法壓平；廠商以開支浩繁，捐稅累重，非裁員無以維持，是以弭制之方，首在疏通物資來源，庶供應不　價乏，物價下降。次在調整捐稅，使廠商之負担得以減輕﹐如是則貧苦羣衆之數量，或不致再形增加。</p>
<p>總之救貧重於救急，値此時期，措施非易，縱財力較有辦法，物力恐亦難以如願﹔故爲求確保社會秩序之安寗，大衆福利之獲得，可目下列各點共同努力，庶救急救貧，得有本末兼治之效。</p>
<p>一，行政機構之一元化　最近機關林立，核　牲質，不免雷同﹐唯管理方式不一﹐條例釐訂互異，遵從困難，應付不易，廠商不勝騷擾之煩，相率停工停　，遂致形成貧苦羣衆之增加。爲解除廠商之困頓，行政機構亟應統一，停業廠商旣少，貧苦失業者目不至增加。</p>
<p>二，肅淸物資運輸　害　因物質之匱乏，血形成物價高漲，現時捨　勵縱入，肅淸輸入　害外，實無遏抑之方﹐是以對輸人上海之物資﹐應極力使之便利，公務人員之留難需索，當嚴加禁阻，水路交通之關卡重重，尤宜立即取締，不此之圖，則層層剝削，販運視爲畏途，來源勢必告竭，求物價之救平烏可得！</p>
<p>三，籌設日用生產工廠　籌劃的款，就市郊公共建築，容納貧民，考查可以利用之材料，創設各種手藝工廠，務使人人有自食其力之機會。</p>
<p>四﹐加强職業介紹機關　無職新舊之工商企業，凡舉辦職業介紹之機關﹐均應取得密切之聯絡，所有謀職人員﹐先行登記，就其智　技能之外，旁及家庭狀况，並派員調查其過去服務之成績與個牲﹐然後量才推　，或加以適當之指導﹐務使人盡甚才，才　其用。</p>
<p>以上所云雖未能謂爲標本兼治之策，但如能防止生產一個貧民﹐或減少一個貧民，即爲國家增强一分財富。是以救急救貧，實爲保持國家元氣根本之圖。</p>
<h3>海軍保甲浦東第三區概况</h3>
<p>— 潘光振</p>
<p>浦柬海軍保甲，自三月份開始籌備，四月一日正式成立，業務方面，有時得循浦東南區公署保甲，和警察局保甲的途徑，因此，海軍保甲推進種種工作，比較還算順利。現在第三區轄境內初步工作，已告一階段，爰將大概情形，作一簡單報吿：</p>
<p>區界：浦東海軍保甲﹐現有一·二·三共三區，第三區幅員最小，人口亦少，東起洋涇港，西至民生路老鴉窠，南至華潛達港，北至黃浦江（形如靴脚）﹐占面積六千畝左右，共計二十保。一百九十八甲，二千六百三十四戶，一萬三千零二十一名人口。</p>
<p>保甲人員：區事務所於洋涇鎭　坊路一百二十二號，設事務員三人，均爲有緒職，每保設保長一人，共二十人﹐每甲設甲長一人，共一百九十八人，保長甲長均義務職。</p>
<p>編查戶口：第三區轄境內戶口，現已編查完畢，關於此項工作，得力於保甲長的努力和經騐之處，實在不少。</p>
<p>整理自警團：鎭辦自　團，因在交替過渡時期，暫告中斷，現經本區將一部份接收過來，計營亭入隻，一帶十一條，　笛七只，繩子十一條，棉大衣二十件，雨衣八件，一俟修理補充後，即能應用，自警團員名額﹐正在照章抽點，統盤計劃﹐不久即可公允輸值。</p>
<p>防空設備：本鎭原有防空設備，甚爲完密，自其負責人曠離職守，負責乏人，因此，一切等於瓦解。就是本區應行接管部份，也是不願交出，本區要是另行添辦，不啻重牀疊架，民力難能負担，而且　耗物資，不合民情節約，本區最重要的防空事務，終因人事上而遷延，尙未實現。</p>
<p>籌組靑年團：本鎭原有靑年團，計一中隊三分隊，分隊地址，均在三區轄境以外，團員住址，亦在轄境以外，因此，不能利用，有重行組織的必要，一俟章則頒下，即行抽點有志靑年，担任此項工作。</p>
<p>徵收保甲費：本區內保甲費，已着手徵收，三四兩月份，限四月底催齊，保甲費分一百元，二百元，四百元，六百元，入百元﹐一千元等數種，本區係窮鄉僻壤地區，因此，除店舖以外，大概每月每戶徵收一百元。眞正無生產能力的赤貧者，得有保甲長證明屬實後，申請豁免。</p>
<p>成立合作社：海軍保甲當局，爲謀保甲人員生活安定增加工作效率起見，特組織海軍保爭人員合作社，最近期內，即將實施配給制度，本區保甲長加人合作社者﹐不久將來﹐即可享受此種權利。</p>
<p>結論：第三區初步工作，雖不能如理想的收穫，可是已經有一些成績了，鄙人承乏區長職務，本身的能力，覺得有限，如果推展到第二步工作的時候，還是要仰仗全體保用人員繼續努力，當地各機關和紳民繼續協力。</p>
<h3>一個小建議</h3>
<p>— 公幹</p>
<p>疏散運動開始已二個多月了，至今還沒有大效果，交通不便，自然是其主因。目前搬人還覺吃力，何况搬家﹖試想一個家庭大大小小的木器箱篋什物等有多少？若想全部搬定，運費怕耍大過了本身的價値，或者箇直運不通。假使把牠們盡丟了，總覺不忍。若說賣給　貨商，則貶價可怕，所得無幾。結果還因「捨不得，跑不出」而存觀望之心，起遲不動。要補救這種缺陷﹐除儘量疏通交通外﹐我想有三點辦法：</p>
<p>設立搬家運輸部：政府聯絡永陸運輸機關，以低廉運費，專替回鄉者搬運傢具什物，同時應儘量維艱航行安全，避免各種無謂損失。</p>
<p>設立回鄉市民傢具收賣所；以公正價格收買回鄉者之傢具﹐以利疏散﹔同時輾轉賣出。</p>
<p>設立回鄉助金；用政府或社會力量，募集款項，資助無力返鄉及無力搬運傢具回鄉者之用。</p>
<p>以上三種辦法，以第二項較爲切於實際，其中機構之設立﹐不妨分爲三</p>
<p>收貨部—在所屬各區，分設收貨部，請本市各業店員作義務估價員。回鄕者願將傢具出售者，得申請該部收買；該部接到申請書後，調查確係回鄉者﹐可派估價員代爲估價收買之，價格以不使市民過份吃虧為原則。</p>
<p>拍賣部—同時在各區兼設拍賣部，司賣出之事。將收得貨物，公開拍賣；稍收佣金，作為開支之用。</p>
<p>運輸部—收買所得之物件，不能在當地售去者﹔可運至附近農村公賣；同時也可補救目前鄕間用具之不足。</p>
<p>至於初期收買之資本，可由市府出而向錢莊銀行信用貸款。該項辦法雖過涉理想﹐若果能實行，疏散運動自可順利進行矣</p>
<h3>敎員電車費</h3>
<p>在決戰階斷中，一般薪水階級的生活？感受嚴重壓迫﹐而尤以小學敎員爲尤甚，我便是其中之一，身受苦痛﹐不堪言喩。自戴英夫先生出長本市敎育局以來，極力改善，市校小學敎員薪水，增至二萬左右，並照公務人員待遇，每月發給食米三斗，生活雖不能完全維持，但能享受如此待遇，在此戰時，已很不錯，我們對敎育當局之一番愛護焦忱，自極感佩。</p>
<p>惟自五月一日起，電車增加票價，每日車費多則千元，少亦須三百元，以我而論，每日需九百元，如購月票二萬四千元，照公務人員對折計算，亦須一萬二千元﹐全月薪水小敎員薪目一萬五千至二萬左右），希望市府方面（不但敎局，其他各局公務人員亦在內），另謀妥善辦法﹐最好公務人員完全免費乘車﹐照目下審察局人員之先例﹔否則准許購軍人票，每次十五元，以改輕負擔。（敎員）</p>
<h3>公務員待遇問題</h3>
<p>— 姚耿軒</p>
<p>目周副院長兼長上海市後，對於本市各種行政機構，已大加整頓；對公務員的待遇﹐亦已加以相常的調整，尤其是警務及財政方面的行政人員的待遇，比普通的高。對　除過去中飽勒索及挨戶需紫等不正行為，可說確已有相當成績了。</p>
<p>調整以後，按報章宣佈的情形，普通每人除免費配給俸米三斗（警務人員自二斗半至六斗）外，尚有至少一萬八千餘元的俸給，在當時確可敷衍過去的。但是現在一般物價比當時又增加了約四五倍；然而公務員的待遇則因財政關係，仍未有　當的調整﹐這是一個値得注意的問題。</p>
<p>從友人方而傳說，現在公務員的待遇，祗有市政府本身及財政局的職員生活比較安定些﹐其他機關除了中高級職員外，其餘大多數職員的薪給﹐殊難維持一家人最低的生活，無怪又有許多訴苦的聲音了。</p>
<p>這些基層公務員﹐是行政機構中最接近民衆的部分，其生活的能否安定，當然直接影響到他們所經辦的工作；如果他們的工作不努力，那末雖有優良的高級長官督率指導，恐亦無能為力。所以照筆者的意見，希望當局對公務員的生活指數，每月作一次統計表報吿，　使大多數職員的薪給能與物價保持相當的比例，使他們的生活有　當的保障，免使過去的不良現象，再有死灰復燃的一日。</p>

<h3>出路</h3>
<p>— 翼凡</p>
<p>在我面前的小桌上　着一張銀紅帖子。</p>
<p>我心裏不再有着驚異了。這不該是很平常的事麼﹐假如能有空去吃杯喜酒，將是愉快的事吧？可是却總像有一根繩索　住我的心，使我感到一種被束縛的煩擾。我不曾明瞭這煩擾的何所來，也沒有理由去解釋它。我不能承認這有着一點日私，我只眞心地爲　底用空言欺騙了自己而悲哀，不管她是否以爲這是幸福。這是人生平常的事，然而就在這平常中我看見了她內在的變更。時間是多麽會改換意志不堅的人啊！她爲什麽耍變更呢？我們從前不是走在一塊的嗎？而從她底言辭與行動中，我曾窺見那果敢向前的精神，我怎能相信地會轉向呢？但她確是變了，變得這末快，甚至沒有讓我來得及知道！我閉上了呢，彷彿正走在萎　的道路上，忽然聽不見那響亮的喚聲了，回頭一看，落落的大野中已失去了那矯健的身影。呵，我又少掉一個同伴了﹐我感到寂寞的難忍。</p>
<p>人們說，結婚是一個女子的歸宿，我雖不相這話，但在相反的一面却以爲結婚後的女子並不一定就和她的事業告了別，也許我不該因這張請帖而煩擾，我該　出坦然的微笑來祝福她，願她姻　美滿；可是我覺到周圍的空氣很穆肅，靜得把一切聲音都擬了，絕不容我笑出來。我抬眼看着窗外，窗外是一個很好的晴天，明亮的陽光射在我的桌上，我的眼落下來，正好又瞥見了那在陽光下更顯得鮮明的帖子。呵，這不正是一個熟悉的情景麼？我要在記憶中復現這熟悉的情景，這才想起還僅是不到一年之前，也是坐在這窗下，也是有明亮的陽光照進來，我興　地展開了她的來信，潔白的信箋在陽光下閃耀着，鮮明不滅於今日的請帖。我曾一字字的讀着：</p>
<p>「……接到你的來信，知道你還這末關心我，可是你未免太過份的誇獎我了，事實上，我何嘗有你所說的那般有希望有前途呢？記得少時在一起，我們是嘻笑親愛，毫無隔膜的，而現在我却不能不懷疑到你已無形中染上了適應社會的成人底敷衍的習牲了。因爲從你的話裏，我看出你對我缺少着眞實的同情，也許倒存着點羨意。俄，你爲什麽不仍這拿出幼時對我的態度來呢？你應該直說出我的錯誤，陳述坦白的意見，更更深一層體會到我的處境，予以同情和安慰。想想看，我是一個從小沒有受過愛撫的人，一直被困迫在家庭中過着凄淸的日子，現在總算勉强進了高中師範，實在也不過是為將來謀生着想，何嘗談得到什麼前途有望呢？當然，從小就對敎學有着特殊的愛好，的確希望自己能將來在敎育界上做一點成績，但是為經濟能力所限，旣不能再求深造，那熱心也就冷去一半了。我心裏去向別人　訴，我想只有你是我幼年的知己，一定能懂得我的，誰知竟又如此，眞是够我心酸！你說我行將畢業，該是值得欣慰的事，但我却正為　畢業而　　心。本來，我就深恐自己不能勝任這敎育的重要的工作，加上目前敎員的待遇如此菲薄，我更深恐不能用勞力換得一碗飯來。再說，我是個女子，是個無能的女子，親肋無　，僅存一個固　的母親，能對我有什麼帮助呢？但　其我是一個貧困的女子，我才不平於女子在社會上所受的種種　迫，我不相　女子一定不能在社會上獨立，我不　於女子的附屬於男子，僅以美容媚態博得男子醜鄙的歡心。我以爲現在的女子在言表上聽來是跳出了封建勢力的圈子了，然而事實上處於貧困境况的女子一點也不曾比從前的女子好到什麼！（當然有些富有的所謂「解放」了的小姐也不過是更多地享受了新世紀的物質，多造成一批爲彼服役的奴隸罷了）。我們受有重重壓迫，就在道重壓之下，我仍喘着氣摸索在不平的小道上，而尋不出一條坦廣的大路來。出路﹐出路，難道生在黑暗裏的女子就眞的沒有出路麽？無論環境怎樣惡劣，我一定要力爭我的出路，以及全體不幸女子的出路！在這上面，我要求你的帮助，望你更眞誠的對待我﹐不撇棄我，熟烈地和我撈起手來。…」</p>
<p>我記得，當我讀完這信後，我深深地感動了。我彷彿看見她挺着胸，揚着手臂在大聲疾呼着﹐她底臉上還殘留着未乾的淚痕﹐勉底明限裏閃動着熱望的光彩。呵，她的姿態是那末動人，她的聲音是那末充滿着力量，我眞想跑到她身邊去熱烈地吻着她，赤誠地告訴她，我愛她，帮助她，對她致以偉大的敬意！</p>
<p>我記得，我立刻覆了她一封信﹐把我的熱情傾吐給了她。那時我眞想她是我最要好的友人了。然而目此以後，我却長久再沒有收到她的來信﹔我關切着她的生活近况，時時寫信去問，終是音信杳然。這使我在失望中雜夾着奇怪與不安，這樣過了些時候，偶然在一個同鄉的口中得到點她的消息，說是已經許配了一個富商的小開，明春就要迎娶了，而讀書將於今冬停止。我當時一聽﹐大爲驚詫，後來却又釋然一笑，以為這不過是個關於她的笑話而已。論年紀，雖已十九歲，但為了她的出路，為了她的素志，為了她的事業，她相信她決不肯拋棄她未完的學業，去到一個不懂得她底心的男人身旁，出賣了她的自由，困守着她的洞房，享受着腐爛的幸福！更何况，她決不會忘記我，——並不是說我是她的愛人，她只該專愛於我而不該去愛別人，而是說她該知道我正有着前行的勇氣，正義的立塲﹐敢於摸索於小道，直尋出人類的出路而後已！至於她是否把我作爲她的愛人，是否一定要和我戀愛成功，却何嘗是我所介意的呢？</p>
<p>懷疑着這個消息，匆匆又過了年了。今春仍舊沒有接到她的來信，我因為事情忙得緊，也就懶得去信。我等待着，等待着，終於在今天接到了這「紅」的消息，這紅的請帖！</p>
<p>啊，她確是和那位富商的公子結了婚了！</p>
<p>她的行動是出於的意外的，這意外的襲擊使我冷然無籍，無語中迸出一星怒火，繼而却又歸於平靜。是的，我有什麽可怪她的呢？幼年的她是胆小意薄的，她底心的深處還藏着那禮敎化身的母親的諄諄訓言，後來竟難爲她從別的友人那兒認識了世界的新潮，懂得了生活的眞義；然而終因她對於舊的殘渣還有着甜蜜的回味，並且愛她的母親勝過了愛新的世界，她要以她的孝順博得母親的歡心，使母親得享受晚年的福份，於是她又悄然辭去了她同路的友人，順着她母親的心意倒在紈袴兒的懷裏了！也許，結婚後的女子並不一定就和她的事業告了別，當然我遺願以誠意視她不忘她一年前的自己的話，給我這信念以事實的證明。然而她如果眞的這樣去做，她還得拋去她婚後的幸福，準備接受新的痛苦，那末這將不該是我在她請我去吃喜酒時對她說的話了。</p>
<p>曾看見多少熱心的靑年，立意去尋找他的出路，終於却轉身向後面投進了他的「歸宿」在「歸宿」裏似乎有着恩愛的慰撫，有着親情的甜蜜。於是　敢於披荆斬棘，爲自己爲人類開出一條平坦的出路來的人，遂暫時感到寂寞的消息。然而抬頭遠望，我依稀看見了一錢天外的閃光。我毅然起立，揮掉無名的被東縛的煩擾，心裏不覺又釋然笑了起來</p>
<p>出路，出路難道是眞的沒有嗎？</p>
<h3>憶南湖</h3>
<p>— 慶曾</p>
<p>我國最早完或的第二條鐵道，滬杭綫的中站——嘉興﹐她是那麽神秘﹐與幽美的一個古城呀！不錯！在十五年前的她﹐還是被蜿蜒的城蘠包　着﹐縣大街的中段仍留着偉大莊嚴，但如今却已是死寂的衙門﹐裏面雖然巳沒有往昔呼叱，猙　的衙役，但　在門前的一對石獅，他們還是一貫地張牙舞爪着。離衙門不遠的平山上，翁高據着一尊鐵銹，銅綠，積得厚厚的土砲……一切的一切，都顯露着神秘古典的美，在這些美的孕育中，便有着一個遐邇聞名的南湖。</p>
<p>南湖！她不像秦淮湖似的濃裝艷抹，更沒有西子湖般的遊艇如　，但他那種　美脫俗的態姿，則舉世聞名的西子，秦淮，也自甘退居次位了，看哪！她有着淸　見底的鄰波，湖心層疊的宮嚴﹐隱藏在合抱大樹下的碑坊，遠遠矗立着的東塔……她能使遊子們留　，她能令旅客們陶醉</p>
<p>就在這名湖北岸﹐高聲着一幢與湖中宮閣遙特的大厦，這便是我的家﹐他　一個永遠年靑的壯士，在漫長的歲月中兀自巍峨地獨立着，她曾認識年靑特的祖母，效亦看到過誕生時父親，當然她更熟悉那時幸福的我——不錯！他看到我有着仁慈的祖母，愛護我的父母，她們如是地　育我﹐如是地陶冶着我。</p>
<p>每　夕陽西墜晚炊裊裊中，父親　喜徘徊在湖邊的柳堤上，以待我放學回家，我遠遠地仲開了兩隻小手，奔跳地投入了他的懷抱，於是他習　地　我除下了書包，高興地訊間些校中的功課，或是講述一隻有趣的故事，我倚着他，凝視着大自然的美景，頃聰着輕鬆，有味的故事。時間從我們快樂的擊笑中　了過去，又是那對湖寺院的鐘聲，迴蕩在湖而的太空，夜幕也在這莊嚴，緩慢的鐘　中，漸漸地展開，我們只才戀戀不捨地路上了歸途。</p>
<p>炎夏來臨的南湖，　自晨至晚地懷抱着各色的遊艇，鐵路爲了遊客們特開專車，船娘們也爲招攬遊客，而爭奇鬥　地蕩着畫舫﹐我們　家的晚餐常歡宴在碧波上，驅陽被擯在船棚外，習習的凉風，從水面無遮地吹來，帶來淙淙的水聲，及陶醉的笑聲，在媚月初昇，繁星乍露的黃昏，許多遊艇帶了疲倦的　聲，蹣　地　開了，　躅地盪遠了。重歸幽靜的南湖，她像默默含情的少女，更添了幾許嫵媚，幾許溫存﹐這時我愛聽祖母或母親講着南湖的故事，故事是多麼地廣泛呀！那湖心的宮閣，她曾停留過隋　，乾隆的遊踪，那淸晰的碧水，他更曾映照過西施，范　之儷影，我興奮，好奇地聽着！聽着！月亮已偸偸地爬過了我們的頭頂，我　視那這遍了銀光的宮關，那注滿了水銀的湖沼﹐腦海中便浮起一串歷史的幻影，陶醉的心靈在月光下遊蕩！　蕅！終於被那款乃的歸　聲喚回了靈魂。</p>
<p>我家的庭園雖沒有染着輝煌，富麗的色彩，我郤愛着他勝過了一切，是有着「天下雖大故　最好」的心理吧﹐那陽光充暢的臥室，他正而對着妍麗的南湖，那關暢明朗的餐　，牠是我們飯餐時歡豪的塲所。我更愛我那小小的畫室，他靜穆地高居東南角上，當我從書桌上偶然抬頭，便能看到湖面飄動的船帆，與遼遠矗立的塔影………凡此種種，都是使我深愛，滿意，及陶醉的。</p>
<p>我那幼小的心版上，已能銘刻並源源理解了：父親常吟的一句詩道：「南挹湖光秀，東迎塔影高。」這歌頌我家景色的作句，是何等地確切和適當呵！</p>
<p>童年！那幸福的童年終於飛逝了，就是那美麗的家園，也早變了陳跡﹐九年前晟霞似的舊夢，消滅得無影無踪﹐唯有那美麗的南湖，我聞得她仍孤獨地寂處着，我不忍看到她，更不願看到她，因為我想像中她定幾了！她一定變了個多　善感的老婦了，因她已看遍了罪惡，閱盡了滄桑。我恨我過拙劣的筆調，　寫不完那叩我心弦的回憶，但這已能使我得到一刻腦海憧景的滿足，與鼓動一些心淵的美麗之漣漪。</p>
<h3>孤獨者</h3>
<p>— 劉臨</p>
<p>昨夜，我又遇見了他。我覺得他的面影是稔熟的，時間把我和他隔絕起來，我感到他的來訪的突兀。但在寂寞的當兒，我還是以歡迎的心情對待我的來客。</p>
<p>他脫下那滿經風霜的大衣，像一艘古舊的帆船卸去了它的風帆。他打量了一下我的屋子：灰色的牆，灰色的窗，凌亂的書籍和傢具﹐這樣他收起了忸怩的神色。</p>
<p>回憶叫我想起他是一個慣於孤獨生活的人，我必須免了那些寒喧。</p>
<p>「你沒有改變你孤獨的性情吧！」</p>
<p>「不會改變的。」他沉默了半嚮。「這是我的個性。」</p>
<p>我記得他曾經這樣說：「我之所以孤獨自持，多少由於我在陰氣森森的屋子裏長大。而在年幼的時候，我沒有和自己年齡相近的游伴。……」於是我對他設：</p>
<p>「現在你總不致於再神往於屋角裏的蛛網了。」「我不是從前就吿訴你，我最愛點綴得美麗的田野，金黃的油菜花，釉粙的綠草……」</p>
<p>「是的，你還告訴我你設法把嬌嫩的前芽移植在心際呢。」</p>
<p>於是我的朋友的臉上也點染上了有生氣的綠色。我似乎覺察到他也曾在生活的漩渦裏，作過掙扎</p>
<p>「但是你別誤會我﹐我終還不致於僭妄到那種地步：以爲自然界的一切都是爲我而安排的。淸晨，小省兒固然伴着我愉悅地啁啾。可是在黃昏時分，目光追隨着歸巢的烏鴉，我也祇能自慰地默然嘆息，把一天的時光送走」</p>
<p>「那末，你不能駕馭你的感情嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的——不過我始終沒有以爲我的生活是猥瑣的。心總得要有個歸宿；這樣，即使在酷寒的冬日﹐我還能在幻想裏安排下一個春天，一個美麗的春郊——而且在冬天，　白的雪花不也是可愛的嗎？」</p>
<p>「唔，你喜悅的情感是勝過悲哀的。」</p>
<p>我的　友垂下頭來，他用惶惑的限光注視着自已的雙膝。灰暗的燈光下﹐我見到他底打着皺的靈魂正顫抖着。他抬起頭來，但我不敢讓我的目光和他的相遇。我不該觸着他心上負着的傷痕，現在，我想，他在沉默裏找到的也許是空虛，或者苦痛。誰說沉默是充實的呢？</p>
<p>我也默然。</p>
<p>在相對的沉默裘，難得的晤面帶來的一點歡欣消失殆盡了。</p>
<p>「可是你知道，後來我也學會了思索。在思索裏也許能找到感情的奧秘。」</p>
<p>「那你就不免要懷疑你周圍的事物了。」我沒有加上我的註釋：「懷疑就是不可解的苦思。」</p>
<p>「你以爲懷疑沒用嗎？它至少也在空白的人生上塗上幾筆。倒是在懷疑的沉思裏，我能從生命裏檢得一些什麼。」</p>
<p>他用疑懼的眼光向我投了一瞥：「我說思索固然使我投進懷疑的圈子裏，但，我終於又跳出這個圈子，我我到了我要追求的東西，也培植了我追求的渴望和憧憬。」</p>
<p>「那再好沒有了。」我覺察再用緊迫的問題追蹤飽的思緒是不常的，「我怕我缺管的就是這一個渴　和憧憬。」</p>
<p>我不敢作坦白的表示。有的時候，出於欺騙的安慰，同情，也能使相互間聯緊親密吧！</p>
<p>接着他說：「當初，我確實相信人生應該皈依目然，不能存着嗔喜　　這種種，就像那些希臘廊下派哲學者所主張的。但後來我更景仰托爾斯泰，並且相信他主張的人生之美在春和愛，而我追求的就是這種美。……」</p>
<p>「還種美多少迹近於玄的。」</p>
<p>「是的，這是無形的美。……」</p>
<p>我沒法打破沉悶的空氣。不然我有沒完盡的問題質問他：「我們是宥，愛者，還是被宥，愛者？」……想到款待客人，我願手遞一枝烟給他。</p>
<p>「讓發霉的烟舒展一下你的心緒吧。」</p>
<p>他一手接過烟，另一隻手緊緊的按住我的肩膀，熱忱地說：</p>
<p>「你知道在這些歲月裏，我始終惦念着你。有你時候﹐你會給我熱情，有的時候是啓示。——你該還沒有把我忘却吧？」</p>
<p>我悒然地想到我不必告訴他：我難得想起他。</p>
<h3>觀影小記</h3>
<p>— 强華</p>
<p>「人海雙珠」觀後</p>
<p>從戲院裏出來，閑閑的走在街上。春天是祗剩尾聲了，夜氣中已經有初夏的意味。時候還早，街上交織着幢幢的人影。我心裏似乎有點什麽在蕩漾。那是從銀幕上沾染來的，淡淡的，有點令人徵　的哀愁。</p>
<p>剛才在戲院裏看的是一張新出的電影，桑孤編導的「人海雙珠」。那裏面沒有什麽生死的爭鬥，沒有什麽驚心動魄的塲面，作者祗用他明爭的觀察，輕倩蘊藉的手法，把觀衆帶向他所創造的天地。銀幕上的人物，似乎都是觀衆素識的，他們的歡喜和悲哀，都和我們息息相關。那是用覊術净化了的人物，所以是溫暖的，親切的。</p>
<p>故事是簡單極了，一對小市民層的姊妹﹐她們溫厚聰明，然而生活苦惱着她們。她們寗靜地，毫無怨艾地挑起世俗的重担﹐疎疎稟稟，在人生道上行進。桑孤先生對他所創造的人物給了最大的同情，又從而寫出一種無可排遣的浮世的恕哀。女主人公約了男朋友來家裏吃飯，偏偏家裏鬧出許多意想不到的笑話，終於弄得不歡而散。姊姊把愛人餽贈的新衣借給妹妹穿，恰巧又給贈衣人所見，因而引起感情上的不快。男主人公正爲　情所苦，偏又受命於他的糊塗上司﹐做他的女友和上司中間的撮合山。……他們都是善良的，無辜的，然而運命處處的加以挪揄。最善意的舉措，對他們也往往變成嘲謔。</p>
<p>去年看過「敎師萬歲」，現在再看「人海雙珠一，桑孤先生的進步是很　然的。從導演手法上看﹐全片和諧自然。有如行雲流水，從絢爛歸於平淡，也就是從揉造趨向了圓熟。他的最大的成就，是不斷地用耐人咀嚼的笑斜來做穿插﹐織成明暗交織起伏相生的波浪。覺得遺憾的是寫悲哀的塲面還不够深沉，因而無形中減低了作品的深度，也就是削弱了一種沁人心脾持力量</p>
<p>然而，我顯然已經為那淡淡的哀愁所陶然了。在暮春夜的街頭走着，我許久沉浸在那不可搔摸的情緒裏。</p>
<h3>賣笛的</h3>
<p>— 吳卞</p>
<p>殘照裏，</p>
<p>一個老頭兒，</p>
<p>破　帽下斑自的　子，</p>
<p>悠揚的笛聲籠罩着</p>
<p>落日的滿街，</p>
<p>纏綿陶醉經過於</p>
<p>行人的心靈，</p>
<p>近了近了。</p>
<p>紋內壳起水晶滴子，</p>
<p>朦朧眼飽含輕愁薄霧，</p>
<p>你，莫非憶味往日，</p>
<p>靑溪畔，田瓏上，</p>
<p>跨牛背放聲一曲。</p>
<p>切莫要，</p>
<p>追上去問，</p>
<p>一天的辛勞換得了升米？</p>
<p>讓他踏着蹣跚的步子</p>
<p>讓他靜靜地吹啜着笛子，</p>
<p>有一片斜陽照着他，遠去遠去。</p>
<h3>讀「星底夢」</h3>
<p>— 方宣</p>
<p>有一位作家說過一句很俏皮的話：詩是文童裏的「闊偌」。眞的，爲什麼其他部份的文藝作品要密密排排地擠在一堆，而獨有寥寥幾行短詩佔了一大塊篇幅？如果僅把散文拆威一行一行地排列，或是加上一些謎語似的文句，就算是「詩」的話，那麽，天下不公平的事，無過於此了。但是，幸而有幾位　歌作者，在貧瘠的圍地裏，「願化爲蚯蚓」；他們的「貨色」使我們平下氣來。他們用着旣不侈泰，也並不過份　　的文句，合於悄理的節奏，呼起了我們讀者的想像，誰說這一大塊空白是浪費的，隨着詩句的罷律，在那上面還不是塗滿了作者所要訴說的色彩，聲普情感，和曲曲折折的故事？</p>
<p>詩人歜靑春就是在這方面努力的一個，讀了他新近出版的結集「星底夢」，不得不使我門　異作者語　的瑰麗﹐視野的擴大﹐和想像力的豐富。詩人對於人世間的衆生相有說不　的憤恨和愛憐，他用着他多色彩的筆觸發洩了他的情感。「有天春天帶來陽光和鮮花，南風播送詩的信號，我也將爲你歌唱而祝福。」想想看，他在什麽樣的心情下寫了這麽許多首詩章，他所期待的還不是我們所期待的，他的愛憎還不是我們的愛憎麽？</p>
<p>在「囚獅」「生活」「開學」「鄉戀」「敏子，你還正年靑」中，我們能窺見作者眞摯的情感，他爲着人間的不平而憤恨，似乎有抑不住的悲哀，但是這悲哀是向上的，使他進一步認識了這社會的面目，他在「生活」的標題下，寫下了這麽幾句詩—：</p>
<p>生命像匹跋涉了萬里的疲馬，</p>
<p>躅於古城的關卡，</p>
<p>縱使你是萬夫莫敵的英雄﹐</p>
<p>或是久經沙塲的好漢，</p>
<p>可能抵擋得住千斤閘的墮身，</p>
<p>有一天，怕不把你</p>
<p>成一團肉漿！</p>
<p>在「鄉　」中，他不僅僅是一種絕望的呼聲了﹐他更刻劃下一幅凄凉的圖電——：</p>
<p>這些年頭　荒交加</p>
<p>大戶的賣田　屋，怕搶怕盜。</p>
<p>貧困的只得流浪走他鄉。</p>
<p>想年老的爹娘﹐</p>
<p>爲兒女倚望門牆</p>
<p>又添幾生白髮？</p>
<p>進一步，他在「棄嬰」要，更顯出了作者藝術的良心，他揚棄了華貴的熟練的詩句，而擷取了活的口話，寫下了一個「從污穢裏，污穢裏你生出；在污穢裘，污穢要你滅亡」。可憐　的悲劇，他一連用數十行詩句簡潔地敍述了那故事接着在末尾喊出了這麽悲天憫人的呼聲！</p>
<p>沒有一個人會記你</p>
<p>——除了你母親</p>
<p>也沒有一個空閒的人，</p>
<p>會對你可憐。</p>
<p>因爲人間的殘酷已敎會了人，</p>
<p>憐憫救不了你，</p>
<p>眼淚也成就不了大事，</p>
<p>眼前的　面耍求他們</p>
<p>忍受更艱苦的來臨！</p>
<p>詩人歌靑春的詩在形式的完整和干句的凝練方面，也有獨得的造就，我不敢說他的　章巳經達到頂究善的境界，但是在大體上說來，他所寫下的各種形式的詩章，在拔巧上找不出頂大的破綻。在「星底夢」「江上」「五月的雨」「向日葵」「我愛」「鴿鈴」裏，我們不　舉出許多可愛的詩句﹐來表明他技巧的成熟，擒住了讀者的遐思而給予一種情感上的舒暢。尤其在「寒園」的短短幾行中，不論在造句和節奏中，都顯出作者造詣的不凡——：</p>
<p>日子似繃緊了的樂絃，</p>
<p>難得有餘暇的間隙，</p>
<p>可喜孩子的幾雙小手，</p>
<p>牽引我到冷落的枯園。</p>
<p>折一枝　葦算作戈矛，</p>
<p>遍地黃草　當它是法塲。</p>
<p>憶周郎赤壁的風雲氣慨，</p>
<p>我席地看草坏上的　戰。</p>
<p>笑馬上的豪雄從人背上倒下。</p>
<p>敗北的孩子這回做了</p>
<p>火燒連營時的曹操！</p>
<p>總之，歌靑春如果繼續不斷地努力下去，在「詩領土」裏是有他前途的。更希望他從認識現實和充實人生這條路上來發展他的詩歌生涯﹐來訴說大家都有份的悲憤和教笑，那麽，他以後送給我們的禮物是更能激起我們的共鳴了。（星底夢，小說月報社出版）</p>

<h3>盛況空前精彩百出　白馬勝聯僑之評述</h3>
<p>— 搜記者</p>
<p>第八次福利足球賽，當局邀請白馬隊與僑聯隊對　，以本届僑聯隊之雄風　與夫白馬隊之陣容煥然，故自此項消息傳出以後，各界望穿秋水，直至日前（十日）比賽之期。雖此賽於下午五時開始﹐乃球謎自三時起已見絡繹而來。其吸引力之大，可見一斑。按此次福利賽目的，乃爲捐助酋人保甲者。該保田之受惠，誠匪淺鮮。茲　者對此賽之評述，以及白馬隊之各方面，加以介紹。</p>
<p>程伯庵談白馬成立</p>
<p>筆者鑒於白馬隊之聲勢赫赫　賽後特訪該隊主幹程伯庵。程君先談自馬隊之成立。於去年夏間，在福華烟公司舉辦福華盃小型聯賽之際。其隊員爲東華聯　兩隊之名手，臨時取名白馬。乃以人材濟濟，果然演出佳妙，嘆爲觀止。本届義將組合之僑聯隊，迭携强隊。以是我白馬同人有再起之心，集合全部人馬，呈准足聯會當局，乃蒙排列第八次福利賽中。同人等志在必勝，故賽前會屬作練習及檢討，乃能今日有如此之良好表演。至於福華有白馬牌香烟之出品，乃本人爲紀念白馬隊耳。</p>
<p>情況熱烈空前未有</p>
<p>此番因兩隊號召力之大，故有愈料以外之熱鬧情况。而海上各電台當日均有廣播，此點爲年來球賽中未見之舉動。故有無數球迷，可不勞往返，安坐聆略戰情。該賽所用之白球，係白色，與平時所用之球不同。光彩奪人，益爲球賽生色。據云，此球係白馬隊軍師徐志豪所計劃者，可調心裁別出。又自馬常局爲應盛况起見，特輯一特刋，當塲分送球迷，使球迷更增興趣。凡此種種，俱爲各賽中所罕有者。</p>
<p>比賽過程異常緊張</p>
<p>大戰延至五時二十五分開始，因白馬隊員之來遲。白馬先開球，居處逆風地位。但各隊員精神所在，全力進攻，聲勢之盛，無以復加。僑聯義軍，一籌時莫展，任憑白馬蹂　。所幸門將麥尼帝身手矯健，得免於難。但白馬五鋒之銳利，球迷莫不贊嘆。不料白馬久攻不入之情形下，在二十六分鐘時反爲僑聯在二十六分鐘，賴角球機會，由維拉主踢，而亞托馬利頭頂成功，先獲一球。白馬隊員，不免爲之失色。直至上半時將終了前，幸孫錦順之隨機應變，單槍匹馬﹐施其強硬之脚頭，一踢而網破。歡呼聲如雷動，上半時遂得各一而和。</p>
<p>下半時起，白馬轉入順風地位，其攻勢更爲興旺。故祗見五前鋒之左衝若突，中衛三將之兵來將擋，後衛之應付裕如﹐而張邦綸遂見生意淸淡矣。二十分鐘時﹐宋靈聖與賈幼良之問，頻施短小傳遞，長驅而下，在適當地點﹐買幼良供送孫錦順，地立絕佳，乃得施其臨空妙射之唯一脚頭，於是僑聯之門再破。前觀衆之愉快﹐似醉似狂。至三十分鐘時，孫　順再得李　之　傳，又告成功。白馬以三對一領前二球矣·義軍爲之氧短，振奮無由。但在完塲前三分鐘，張林根不愼於禁區內撞人犯規，被罰十二碼球。乃爲西拉蒂罰入，僑聯遂得以此而追上一球。白馬終以三對二克服本届戰績彪炳，連獲市長盃國際盃之錦標隊僑聯隊。國產球迷，無不爲之承爲爽快也。</p>
<p>白馬猛竄僑聯保守</p>
<p>白馬得韓龍海之趕返助陣，因明悉僑聯之後衛死守方式，有龍海之猛竄，必可予以威脅·故一上塲即絕對採用此項戰術。以此僑聯後衛，遂竭力設法集中注意能海。羅旭萊固不能釘住，西拉蒂便在後補上。因此孫錦　遂　有頻多機會。李　亦　時活躍，故白馬前鋒在如是情形之下，党有不活躍之理。次之，則以宋靈　之前衝具有助攻之能力，故亦爲補助白馬攻勢吒盛之另一原因也。而白馬五鋒用一字形並進，使其保守衡之拙於應付﹐又爲得策。故全賽白馬有控制攻勢之事實，絕非倖致。</p>
<p>僑聯之所以敗，完全過於在守衛上注意記海，而事實不注意龍海，有被竄入可能。一注意，其餘各將遂得空隙矣。其前鋒之調度，以亞托馬利　爲左翼。按亞本爲內鋒，有返助守之力量，不識何以使其左移，此減少守勢，實爲施策之最大者也。</p>

<h3>排球季節開始　對發球規則之討論</h3>
<p>排球季節業已到達，對於規則似有討論之必要。去年上海市排球聯賽中，進行雖極順利，但不幸以各裁判對於發球時之跳躍運動，意見分歧，以至互爲指摘·就排球規則明文之規定而論，決無兩可至文字。是以摘論規則一二條，諸希各球員予以注意。一方還希排球裁判會會員加以指正，則幸甚矣！</p>
<p>在排球規則第七條比賽規則中第二例之全文，謂：「比賽開始時，應由先發球之一隊中發球次序之第　人，將球用隻手（張　或握緊）從網上發入對區，發球時，球員之雙足，應立於端綫之後，（即，端綫離網爲達之處）面介於兩邊綫之引長綫間，　預備發球時至球擊着爲止，　足不得越過端綫，發球員得繼續發球至裁判員宣告「失攻」爲止。此時對隊發球次序中之第一人，乃輪及發球。」幷於下面加註。「如塲外無充分空地，發球動作不能展開者，得於端綫前，適當距離處，另劃一發球綫。」其中「發球時球員之　足應立於端綫之後」一語中，明白說明。「雙」足「立」於端綫之後，一足提起，一足立住，巳屬欠妥。嚴格言之，一足提起巳是犯規，何况兩足瞰地而跳　乎﹐此其一。或謂我國遠東代表課永湛君之發球，先行後退若干距離，然後再進前發球，此事與規則幷無抵　。因未發球時﹐即奔跑全塲，亦屬無妨。及發球時，立停擊出。若牽強以籃球規則解釋之，則屬非是。籃球規則不能用以解釋排球規則。反之，排球規則亦不可用以解釋籃球規則。各種球類具有各種特性，不可互爲曲解，此其二。是以發球時之跳躍運動應加限止。蓋規定之規定，均本「利權均等」之原則而指定，決無袒護任何一方者。再質諸排球規則第六條定名之解釋第五例，載有「犯第七條第二條之規定者謂之失誤﹐」足證規則幷無顧此失彼之幣也生辰起見，發起全滬團處乒乓錦標賽，分甲乙兩組，並定名「連慶盃」，以示尊敬，而留紀念。（陳霖笙）</p>
<h3>聯華銀行提倡　銀行員運動</h3>
<p>聯華銀行當局爲提倡業餘運動，去歲曾舉辦聯華盃小型球賽，成績殊爲美滿。故本届續辦第二届聯華盃小型球賽，將加倍努力，以符初　。茲悉本届決分銀行及普通兩組。對於前者，自爲不忘其本身。溯銀行業過去有銀錢聯誼會之後，則有金城銀行之同德盃籃球賽，使銀行從業員公餘有鍛　機會，意義深長，唯其後即默然無聞。迄上年聯華銀行又乘時崛起﹐果然各銀行紛紛組隊加入，盛極一時。本届該當局劉哲民秦　畢等以鑒於海上銀行員之需要正當消還，更爲急不待綏。故第二屆聯華盃在此足球季節之後，小型足球勢必熱鬧，　辦第二届聯華盃。</p>
<p>茲該盃賽銀行組決先舉行，已定於六月三日開幕，想届時各銀行必紛紛組隊加入，將有一番新氣象也。</p>

<h3>籃球學理述要（十九）</h3>
<p>— 粱兆安</p>
<p>總言之，以上二種防守法，雖各有其利弊，然在運用則各有其價値在。例如用五人聯防法，主要目的在節省氣力，及防禦阻擋進攻法。但用此法防守，必須於本隊失球時，能五人同時急速退守。否則對方一下快攻，即不能阻其勢，此種守法之最大弱點，爲不能壓迫對方進攻。故於對方獲分較高，而採用緩攻法，或以外圈互相傳球，以來達比賽時問告終。慶取分數勝利時，則不能畢守此法，應即改用人釘人防守法，強迫對方進攻，以便取得其失球反攻。用「人釘人」防守法，主要目的，在破壞對方陳綫，及强迫對方急忙進攻，使其無暇喘息。但用此法防守﹐首要在本隊球員對敵方球員，能但別實力支配得宜，否則若有一人，能力不敵對方時，則成漏洞，發生絕大危險。此種防守法最大缺點，在不能克制阻擋法進攻，而且甚爲費力。不適宜於程度較低，及年齡較長之球隊。故遇對方行阻擋法進攻時，必須改用五人分區聯防法，各人嚴守一區，以不變應萬變之策，抵禦其變化莫測之擋人法四人對三人，或對方已有三人以上防守之時，則快攻之可能性漸失矣。故機警善戰之球隊，於每次獲球後，必首先覓此種機會，如快攻不可能，方另國他種戰法。</p>
<p>查快攻法，最適用於較大之球塲，及破五人聯防法。惟採用此種戰法者，先決條件爲全隊隊員比常人優秀，技術水準高﹐基木動作嫻熟﹐感應敏　﹐觀察與判斷力强﹐能合作與臨機應變﹐及全盤戰略，始能奏效也。</p>
<h3>（乙）陣地戰法</h3>
<p>所謂陣地戰法者，乃在攻防兩方陣綫已成，方行進攻之謂也。其名稱有多種：即八字形進攻法，斜角襲擊，中央突破，邊垂偸進，外攻內應，輪盛戰，樞紐進攻，延誤時間等戰法是也。</p>

<h3>Specially Equipped Aircraft Carriers, Battlecruisers, etc., Continued Sinking and Destroying Seventeen Vessels, Killing and Wounding 12,600 Personnel</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Okinawa Island Battle Results</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 11th:</p>
<p>The enemy's first line in the southern area of Okinawa Island launched repeated attacks on Japanese positions in the area of Xie, Kouchi, Maede, and Anza from May 10th. Japanese forces in the area continued to engage them. From April 29th to the evening of May 2nd, the Japanese side has confirmed the following battle results: 12,600 enemy personnel killed or wounded, 134 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 39 artillery pieces of various types destroyed. The Japanese air force and submarine forces continued to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and enemy warships and mobile forces near the island. Since May 6th, the Japanese side has confirmed the following battle results: two specially equipped aircraft carriers sunk, one battleship, two cruisers, one transport ship, one submarine, and one ship of unknown type. Three specially equipped aircraft carriers destroyed, one transport ship, five ships of unknown type, and over twenty-five locations set ablaze. The majority of the air force units participating in the above attacks belonged to the special attack (kamikaze) squadrons.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – On the 10th, at dawn, a Japanese special attack squadron attacked a large, specially equipped enemy aircraft carrier near the Yaeyama Islands, causing a large fire.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Guam dispatch: The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced today that U.S. forces in the Ryukyu Islands, assisted by battleships and cruisers, continued to bombard Japanese southern front facilities yesterday. In the battle for Okinawa Island, the U.S. military has so far suffered the following casualties: 2,107 army deaths, 557 marine deaths, 10,402 army wounded, 2,800 marine wounded, and over 500 missing.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Unfolding in the South and West Coast</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Since April 26th, when the enemy forces launched their second general offensive against the southern front of Okinawa Island, they have suffered heavy casualties due to the courageous resistance of the Japanese army. By the end of April, the enemy's plans were frustrated, but their will to fight remained strong. In May, after receiving reinforcements of personnel and supplies, the enemy attempted to break through the Japanese lines north of Shuri, launching repeated and intense attacks. Although the enemy's naval power has been severely damaged by continuous attacks from the Japanese air force, they are willing to reinforce their troops and supplies in order to maintain their current strategic advantage of securing maritime supply lines and to destroy the Japanese counter-attack power in the short term. At the same time, after the end of the European war, they intend to use the Okinawa operation as an opportunity to advance further and create the impression of smooth progress in U.S. military operations in the Greater East Asia War to China and abroad. Therefore, the enemy's offensive has intensified since the morning of the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, powerful enemy units, under the cover of tanks, launched attacks from the south of Shuri towards the south of Maeda and the Anbocha area. At that time, the Japanese defenders immediately engaged them in fierce battles. Simultaneously, the enemy also launched an offensive on the west coast. At around 6:00 AM on the 10th, the enemy began a river crossing battle at the Anza River in front of Anza Village (3 kilometers north of Naha), a strategic point, using about 40 boats. By 7:30 AM, the enemy was repelled after suffering heavy blows from the Japanese defenders. Subsequently, at around 11:30 AM, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the enemy mobilized amphibious tanks and began another river crossing operation at the Anza River. At present, both sides are engaged in fierce battles on the east and west lines of Anza Village. Consequently, the confrontation between the Japanese and U.S. forces on the southern front on the 10th stretches from Gasa on the east coast, through Xinji Maeda, to Anza on the west coast, a front line of approximately eight kilometers. Currently, both sides are engaged in repeated fierce battles.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Japanese Battle Results</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the enemy's landing until April 29th, when the enemy's second offensive was frustrated, the Japanese army achieved the following battle results: 22,100 enemy killed, 325 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 102 artillery pieces of various types destroyed. Subsequently, in the nine days until May 7th, the Japanese army confirmed the following battle results in battle: 12,600 enemy killed, 134 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 39 artillery pieces of various types destroyed. If the enemy's landing forces are totalled since they began offensive, then the Japanese army on land has caused the enemy the loss of 34,700 killed, 459 tanks abandoned and destroyed, and 140 artillery pieces of various types destroyed, with total enemy landing force casualties representing one third of their troops. Since the enemy forces began their new offensive on the 9th, given advantageous terrain and harmony, before the Japanese defense line's fierce counter offensive, their casualties will become increasingly greater. Also, after the weather improves, Japanese special attack squadrons, air force units, and submarines will fully exert their power in courageous attacks on enemy warships and airfields around the island. On the evening of the 9th, it was confirmed from land that enemy warships were subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese special attack aircraft, resulting in the sinking of one submarine and one cruiser. At the same time, two ships of unknown type were destroyed and set ablaze.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Cai to Japan Paid Respects to the Imperial Palace Yesterday</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a special municipality, but in general terms, it is the heart of Jiangsu Province. In military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, all movements in Shanghai are sufficient to affect Jiangsu Province and even the entire Central China region. Therefore, governing Jiangsu Province must start from the perspective of Shanghai; and governing Shanghai must also start from the perspective of Jiangsu Province. The division between the province and the special municipality is formal; in practice, one cannot hold territorial prejudices. When the provincial governor came to Shanghai last month, his speeches at the welcome banquet hosted by various sectors of the city, as well as his discussions with leaders from all walks of life, demonstrated a clear understanding of the close relationship between the province and the city, and he held many wise views. In particular, regarding the various concrete problems that Shanghai urgently needs to solve today, he was able to base his actions on this understanding and demonstrate his determination to weather the storm together, which is truly worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Although there are many undertakings that Shanghai urgently needs to carry out, the most important are: first, the implementation of wartime population evacuation; second, the development of Shanghai's industries in various parts of Jiangsu Province; third, the establishment of agricultural loans; fourth, the construction of the Jiangsu-Shanghai highway, etc. These matters are directly related to the urgent problems that Shanghai needs to solve, and indirectly closely related to the political and economic situation of Jiangsu Province. Therefore, both sides should not hold any territorial prejudices, but should do their part and actively promote these undertakings.</p>
<p>First, regarding the issue of population evacuation, although the authorities of Jiangsu Province and the responsible parties in Shanghai have cooperated since its inception, it has not yet achieved results, and the phenomenon of overpopulation remains serious. If evacuation is not actively promoted, unnecessary sacrifices will be made once air raids become rampant, which is truly not worthwhile. Moreover, the large labor force in Shanghai can be evacuated in a planned manner to various parts of Jiangsu Province to assist in the province's development and construction, which is also of great significance. However, issues such as transportation, local security, and supplies all require more active and closer cooperation between the responsible authorities in Jiangsu and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, regarding industrial evacuation, today, Shanghai's various industries are unable to operate due to electricity, fuel, and raw material problems, and are at a standstill. Many manufacturers are facing difficulties due to increasing expenses, and are struggling to survive by reducing capital or laying off employees. The number of unemployed people is increasing, and the social crisis is worsening. If Shanghai falls into a state of war, everything will be destroyed, and recovery will not be easy. Therefore, Shanghai entrepreneurs should not wait and see, but should decisively move to various parts of Jiangsu Province and make plans to break up their businesses into smaller units. When Shanghai factories resume operation in various parts of the province, the prosperity of various small towns can be expected soon, and new industrial zones will not be difficult to emerge in the future. Therefore, the provincial government should actively provide strong assistance to the industrial sector in Shanghai.</p>
<p>As for agricultural loans, they can directly save the decline of the rural areas of Jiangsu Province, and further enhance the strength of rural revitalization; at the same time, for Shanghai, after a large amount of idle funds return to the countryside, the phenomenon of speculation and hoarding can be reduced, and the financial and economic sectors can gradually return to normal. If agricultural loans are handled properly, the result can eliminate the social and political crises of both the city and the countryside, so that the Communist Party, which is peering from the sidelines, cannot promote its activities, which is especially beneficial in many ways. However, the success of this undertaking depends on close cooperation between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>The relationship between Jiangsu and Shanghai can be seen from the above points. These undertakings have already been started and are awaiting the cooperation and promotion of the authorities of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Today, representatives of the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors, led by Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Chen Riping as the head and deputy head of the delegation, are organizing a Jiangsu Province visit group to inspect Jiangsu Province and discuss with the provincial authorities, focusing on the above-mentioned matters. We sincerely wish the delegation success, which is also the achievement of the interests of both the province and the city. Local news</p>
<h3>News from Bengbu Scenery</h3>
<p>— Gu Ge</p>
<p>Bengbu is a small town on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway on the Huai River. Before the Jinpu Road was built, it was just a small village of a few dozen households. When the railway was built, because its position was exactly at the intersection of north and south, it gradually became prosperous. To this day, there are people who only know Bengbu but don't know that the Fengyang County government was originally located on Bengbu Street!</p>
<p>Bengbu is located in northern Anhui, but it is not far from Jiangnan. Therefore, here you can see mule carts and ox carts full of northern flavor, as well as "Lao Kuai" with slanting clothes and black sweat on their faces, nervously driving livestock; you can also see ships clustered in the Huai River, large freighters, small fishing boats, beautiful fisherwomen, hunched fishermen… Bengbu—no, Fengyang people have the simplicity and boldness of northerners, but also hide the humble character of Jiangnan people. However, in recent years, along with foreign goods, a lot of exaggeration and cunning have also been transported by train.</p>
<p>Bengbu has three strangenesses. What are the three strangenesses? First, there are many men. Because it is the location of the provincial government, with numerous institutions, plus many merchants coming and going, there are especially many single men. You bump into men on the road, and most of them are wearing badges. Therefore, "Three men walking together, there must be my 'official'," is indeed not an exaggeration! Second, there are no teahouses. Teahouses are one of the quintessence of our country, and there is no need to say more. In the places I have been to, whether north or south of the Yangtze River, even small towns and large villages have teahouses dotted around. But in this magnificent location of the Anhui provincial capital, there are none! You can't find one even if you run all over Bengbu! Third, the "rat dragon" style money houses. These emerged after the war, because of the different currency systems in the north and south, and Bengbu became the place to exchange currencies. Northern travelers must get off here and exchange for Central Reserve Bank notes to go south, and southerners must also exchange for Joint Reserve Bank notes here. These money houses are concentrated in the area of Second Road, Guohuo Road, and are called money houses, but they are actually very simple. Just a wire cage of a little over a foot cube, and a fellow countryman with a square face and toe, and you can trade. There are no fewer than dozens of these "cages." Although they seem small, they have a considerable determining effect on Bengbu's finance!</p>
<p>The most lively place in Bengbu is Second Road. There are all kinds of shops, and there are six or seven jewelry stores. Moreover, the road is paved with asphalt—as for the rest of the streets, they are all "original" mud. The mud here is especially sticky. As soon as it rains, the mud mixed with water immediately becomes a thin slurry and floats up. If you step in, at least half a shoe deep is trapped. This mud is sealed on the shoes, and it is strangely hard when it dries. It takes more than half a day to scrape it off.</p>
<p>When the west wind leaves, spring comes to the world. But Bengbu has no spring. In the town, although we feel that the weather is warm, the feeling of spring is—missing. Because the only bit of spring scenery is all locked in the mansions of the rich. Apart from these few "things", it is difficult to find a willow tree letting out green, or half a wild grass or flower, in the whole city. As for the suburbs, apart from the green wheat fields, you can only see an endless expanse of yellow earth, and the really yellow water of the Huai River, which doesn't flow much like still water, the yellow dikes, the yellow villages… In the distance, there may occasionally be one or two barren mountains, but not only can't they be said to be beautiful or majestic, but they also make the surrounding area seem even more desolate. There is also a small Nan Mountain south of the town that is slightly decorative, but calling it a mountain is better than calling it a hill.</p>
<p>But Bengbu's cultural situation is even more desolate. Large bookstores such as Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Kaiming, and Shijie all have branches, mainly selling stationery and textbooks. Only one newspaper, the Anhui Daily, publishes half a sheet a day, and the special feature column mostly reprints Shanghai newspapers. The supplement "Dadi" is extremely small. There is a library, which is considered provincial, but the books are pitifully few, probably less than a thousand.</p>
<p>There is one movie theater, one Beijing opera troupe, and one bang-bang opera troupe for entertainment venues. Xu Xinyuan's troupe had previously performed his "masterpiece" in terms of spoken dramas, and the box office seemed to be okay. Not long ago, they also commemorated the New Games and staged a drama at the Oriental Cinema, Hong Mo's "Guan Di's Visit," directed by Wu Qi, who the newspaper said had ten years of experience in stage drama, and the actors included "established" actors invited from Nanjing and young "officials." The stage conditions, however, were lacking in lighting, scenery, and props. The performance results were naturally difficult to ask for. On the first day, it sold out with soldiers, police, and students, but people began to slip away in the second scene of the first act. Before the play was half over, half of the people had run away. From the opening to the curtain, there was endless applause. The next day, the cast was reorganized and rearranged, and the results were indeed much better. Moreover, no one dared to boo, because the military police ordered that booing was strictly prohibited. So the audience became trembling and did not dare to laugh loudly even when they saw something really funny. This was quite humorous!</p>
<p>As for prostitutes, which are "symbols of culture," of course there are them, and there is also a "prostitute training class." All prostitutes must receive three months of training, and after the expiration of the term, they are recognized as "official" prostitutes.</p>
<p>The prices in Bengbu are roughly the same as in other inland cities, with local products being cheap and foreign goods being expensive. The price of rice is around 40,000, meat is 400 to 500 per catty, and vegetables are more than half cheaper than in Shanghai. Even so, many low-level civil servants with too low fixed salaries pawn their clothes.</p>
<p>Bengbu's law enforcement is particularly clear. There is no black market near the station, the police do not extort on the streets, and there are far fewer cases of corruption than in other places. People from Shanghai feel cool when they come to Bengbu. This is something that Bengbu people can be proud of.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the Huai River, which is prone to tantrums. The river is one mile away from Bengzhen, with two dams blocking it. In these three or four months, standing on the dam and looking out, it is such a quiet piece of yellow water. Occasionally, you can see one or two small boats with full sails, or three or five boatmen vigorously donating cargo ships… But when Hongze Lake is about to flood, no trenches can stop the power of this yellow water. As long as Fengyang people who are a bit older can probably vividly tell about several terrible floods here! …</p>
<p>"Speaking of Fengyang, talking about Fengyang, Fengyang is a good place, but since Emperor Zhu came out, there have been nine years of famine in ten years." This dispatch stops here.</p>

<p>Tea Party Circumstances</p>
<p>At the beginning of the tea party, the chairmen of the presidium, Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Li Sihao, successively delivered welcome speeches, followed by a speech from Governor Ding. Then, Huang Sizhai, a representative of the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, gave a speech. Finally, everyone enjoyed refreshments. The party concluded at 5:30 PM with great joy. The speeches of each speaker are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Speech</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, our Ningbo and Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Associations are participating in this tea party to welcome Governor Ding. We feel particularly excited because Governor Ding is about to take office in Zhejiang, serving as our local official. Although we formally represent only the fellow villagers of Ningbo and Shaoxing, in reality, we represent all the fellow villagers of Zhejiang in our hearts, which makes us feel especially enthusiastic. We have known Governor Ding for a long time. We have often been in contact with him in his previous role as Minister of Social Welfare. We have long admired his talent and meticulousness. Zhejiang's position is extremely important in the current peaceful region, and the public security in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area, as well as the situation that may lead to a mainland war, are even more important. Governor Ding also holds military responsibilities, so his task is naturally even more arduous. We sincerely hope that he will make good use of his meticulous talents to ensure public security and turn danger into safety. As for reforming provincial administration and benefiting the people of Zhejiang, we firmly believe that he will be able to realize the expectations of the people of Zhejiang. We wish him success in his endeavors."</p>
<p>Li Sihao's Speech</p>
<p>Li Sihao, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, five organizations are welcoming Governor Ding, and we are honored to participate on behalf of the Shanghai charitable organizations. Governor Ding was the head official in charge of our charitable organizations during his tenure as Minister of Social Welfare. He provided much guidance and assistance to the charitable organizations in Shanghai, and we received many practical benefits. I remember last year, when Madam Ding celebrated her birthday, various parties offered congratulations. Minister Ding used all the congratulatory gifts entirely for charitable purposes, distributing them to various charitable organizations in Beijing and Shanghai. He truly set an example and cared for charitable undertakings. Therefore, now that Governor Ding has been transferred to govern Zhejiang Province, we, from the standpoint of charitable organizations, feel a sense of reluctance to part. We hope that Governor Ding will not consider the distance too great and will provide guidance and continued assistance at any time. At the same time, Shanghai is currently preparing for evacuation, and charitable organizations are especially among the first to be evacuated. If there are suitable places within Zhejiang Province, we hope that Governor Ding will pay special attention to providing assistance. Today, we express our feelings of reluctance to part and gratitude, and at the same time, we express our welcome and expectations. We wish him brightness and health."</p>
<p>Governor Ding's Speech</p>
<p>Governor Ding gave the following speech: "Today, I am very honored and grateful to be welcomed by various Shanghai and Shanghai Fellow Villagers Associations. I am deeply ashamed that Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Li Sihao have praised my past work, and I feel even more uneasy about the expectations for my future work. Although the environment and duties of my transfer to Zhejiang this time are different from my previous position in the Ministry of Social Welfare, the purpose is the same. My purpose is to serve society with loyalty. Since the beginning of the war in 1939 and the return of the National Government to the capital in 1940, my work has never left the words 'social' and 'welfare.' Whether it was the Central Social Affairs Department, the Social Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, the Social Movement Command Committee, or the Ministry of Social Welfare, the names of the institutions were different, but the work was still the same: 'serving society' and benefiting the people.</p>
<p>This time, my transfer to Zhejiang has certainly brought about great changes in terms of region and authority, but it can be said that there has been no change in my consistent purpose of 'serving society' and 'benefiting the people.' The only difference is that in the past I was responsible for a partial responsibility in a spatial space, while in the future I will be responsible for the entire responsibility in a local space. No matter what the space is like, and no matter what the parts are like, it is the duty of the government to serve society and benefit the people. During my time at the Ministry of Social Welfare in the past, because the Ministry of Social Welfare was a newly established administrative agency in China, everything had to be built from scratch. Fortunately, with the cooperation of all sectors, a considerable foundation has been laid, especially with the great cooperation of leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. Although I have now left the Ministry of Social Welfare, I will always express my gratitude for the efforts of all sectors in Shanghai. This time I was transferred to Zhejiang. Zhejiang is very close to Shanghai, and there are many fellow villagers from Zhejiang in Shanghai, so there are many connections in politics, economy, and culture. I hope that the leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai and the fellow villagers from Zhejiang will continue to assist and urge me in the same way as before. The late Chairman Wang instructed the people of the country on New Year's Day last year to make the minimum effort to establish public security and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Zhejiang provincial government, it has been more than five years. Through the efforts of Governors Fu and Xiang, it has reached the point of establishing public security and stabilizing people's livelihood. This time I am going to Zhejiang, I pray to ensure public security and improve people's livelihood. Under these two major principles, I will implement my long-standing purpose of serving society and benefiting the military of the people. However, in order to ensure public security, we must first improve people's livelihood. If people's livelihood cannot be improved, then public security cannot be ensured. In order to improve people's livelihood, we must start with increasing production and circulating production materials. To increase production and circulate materials, we need the cooperation of the economic circles in Shanghai. Zhejiang fellow villagers in Shanghai have always occupied a strong position in the economic circles in Shanghai, so I hope that all Zhejiang fellow villagers in Shanghai will return a part of their strength to Zhejiang for the sake of loving their hometown.</p>
<p>Regarding my leadership in Zhejiang, I can tell you two things: First, in terms of personnel, we will absolutely adhere to the principle of recruiting Zhejiang fellow villagers. Second, we will pay attention to the communication between public opinion and the government in the future. We also plan to establish an advisory committee, similar to the Shanghai method, to communicate the opinions of officials and the public, and to express the openness of provincial administration. If any of you fellow villagers have suitable candidates, please recommend them for the benefit of the people."</p>
<p>Huang Yuqi's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "Today, I am honored to participate as a representative of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and the fellow villagers of the seven counties of Shaoxing also feel deeply honored. Under the expectations of the two chairmen, Yuan Ludeng and Li Sihao, and after listening to Governor Ding's instructions, I have a deeper understanding. Governor Ding's leadership of Zhejiang this time places a heavy responsibility on the fellow villagers of Ningbo, Shaoxing, and the entire province of Zhejiang. We should sincerely cooperate. We are even more grateful for Governor Ding's instructions to govern Zhejiang Province with Zhejiang people. In the past, Governor Chuan was concerned about the suffering of the people and specially convened a meeting with fellow villagers in Shanghai to fulfill the expectations of our fellow villagers. This time, Governor Ding is in charge of overall planning, and his spirit will surely lead to bright results. We also hope that Governor Ding will treat the people like his own children after taking office, do his best to protect them, and pacify the local area. Finally, I wish Governor Ding good health in his administration."</p>

<p>Chairman's Instructions</p>
<p>The speech of Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government and concurrently Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, briefly stated: "Distinguished guests, officials, and students, today I have come to Shanghai from Beijing to attend the graduation ceremony of the fourth class of students from the Central Naval Academy. I am very gratified. Today, the most important thing for all of you students graduating is to understand the government's policies. In other words, we must follow the national policy, taking the Three Principles of the People and Pan-Asianism as the starting point, striving for national freedom through peace, seeking domestic unity through anti-communism, and then striving for national independence through nation-building. Now that the situation is becoming increasingly tense, the meaning of the government's participation in the Greater East Asia War is the initial purpose of the establishment of the National Government, and it is also the purpose of the National Government's first establishment in Guangzhou, which is to abolish unequal treaties, strive for equal independence and the freedom and liberation of the entire nation, and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together. This is the highest purpose of the National Government's participation in the war, regardless of success or failure. Now the National Government is demanding freedom, independence, and unity. This point should be paid special attention to and must be thoroughly understood. Although it is not easy for our navy to seek satisfaction in terms of material resources, the army, navy, and air force all have their common conditions, and the government has a unified plan. I hope that after graduation, you will work hard to study, prepare the latest knowledge, and revitalize the Chinese Navy. No matter how lacking the material conditions are, and no matter how urgent the situation is, we should strengthen our efforts in the navy and expand our navy. This is my expectation for the future of our navy and the construction of you yourselves."</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Convened First Business Meeting Yesterday; Various Branches Report on Policy Implementation</h3>
<p>Since Director Zhou took office, the Municipal Police Bureau has spared no effort in rectifying and promoting the city's police administration. Recently, in order to understand the policy implementation of various branches and to ensure the upward transmission of lower-level information, it was decided to hold a business meeting once a month for the purpose of pooling wisdom. It is now learned that the first business meeting was held yesterday (the 11th) at 9:00 AM.

<p>Key Points of Director Zhou's Instructions</p>
<p>The key points of Director Zhou's instructions are as follows: In the past, the focus was on rectification work, which can also be said to be passive work, which is to earnestly eliminate the bad habits of police officers who harass citizens. In the future, we must pay attention to strengthening work, which can also be said to be active work, so that the police officers under their jurisdiction will not harass citizens, and the police officers should be able to protect the safety of citizens and increase the welfare of citizens. He also instructed the branch directors to pay attention to the following matters: Prevent theft and robbery cases from occurring; Improve the handling procedures for judicial cases, and do not cause any difficulties for plaintiffs, and improve the treatment of detainees.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Plans to Build the Su-Hu Highway</h3>
<p>The Su-Hu Highway is formed by connecting the Su-Kun Road and the Kun-Hu Road, which is an important transportation line between Jiangsu Province and Shanghai. Since the incident, all the bridges and road surfaces have been severely damaged. Considering that highway transportation is becoming increasingly important, Sun Yucai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bureau and concurrently Director of the Construction General Engineering Office, and Deputy Director Xu Ying, following the instructions of Governor Ren, sent personnel last month to conduct a detailed survey and plan for construction. The road within Jiangsu Province is 57 kilometers long, 7.5 meters wide, and the original coal layer road surface is 5.5 meters wide. There are 76 bridges (including the Gu Pu Bridge at the provincial and municipal boundary). Except for 24 bridges that have been filled, there are 6 semi-permanent bridge wedges and 46 temporary wooden bridges. The repair plan prepared by the office is as follows: Bridge Engineering: The width of all original bridges with a width of less than 4 meters will be changed to 4 meters to facilitate traffic. The load-bearing capacity of all bridges under 6 tons will be corrected to allow 6-ton vehicles to pass. Bridges that have been damaged and do not interfere with waterway traffic and farmland irrigation will be filled to save repair costs. Road Surface Engineering: The principle of using local materials will be adopted. Heavily damaged parts will be made of crushed stone or crushed brick foundation to make it solid and flat. A 4.5-meter wide and 2.5-centimeter thick macadam road surface will be paved, and the road arch will be corrected. The engineering cost for the entire bridge wedge road surface is estimated to be approximately 200,000 yuan. The entire plan has been submitted to the Governor by the office and approved, and preparations are now being actively made for construction. The office will divide the entire project into two sections for road surface and bridges, publish advertisements in various Shanghai and Jiangsu newspapers for business bidding, and schedule the opening of bids in the office's auditorium on the 15th of this month to start construction as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Report from Xu, Director of the Construction Bureau: Recent Developments in Various Construction Projects, Answering Questions at the Press Conference</h3>
<p>The press conference, hosted by the Municipal Publicity Department, was held at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 11th) in the Municipal Government Conference Hall. Director Xu Ji-dun of the Construction Bureau was invited to report on the recent progress of various construction projects in the city. Director Xu explained in detail the recent policy implementations, road construction, and other issues. Finally, he also shared his impressions of the recent inspection of various affiliated agencies of the Bureau. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Recent Policy Implementations</p>
<p>What is the general situation of the Construction Bureau's recent policy implementations? (Answer) It can be divided into the following points: First, after the merger of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Municipal Engineering Bureau into the Construction Bureau, the departments of the two bureaus were managed separately. The affiliated agencies of the two bureaus were also gradually adjusted, merged regionally, and then divided into groups. This is a pilot program. Second, after the merger, the Public Works Bureau and the Engineering Bureau had a total of 3,000 workers. In the past, due to disorganization, they were gradually laid off. So far, it has been reduced to 2,000 workers, all of whom are given proper management to maximize work efficiency. Third, in the past, the warehouses were full of materials. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of raw materials has become difficult, and procurement is difficult, resulting in the gradual depletion of stockpiled materials. Recently, the Bureau plans to purchase additional supplies. Fourth, due to the shortage of materials, it is difficult to accommodate the difficulties of applicants for vehicle inspections. The inspection standards are relatively low. However, various vehicles that endanger public safety, obstruct traffic, and pose a risk of accidents are strictly prohibited from driving. Fifth, the re-adjustment of car license plates is underway to show uniformity. It is being actively organized, and in the future, a "沪" (Hu, short for Shanghai) character will be added to each car license plate for identification. Sixth, in the past, the order at the docks was extremely chaotic. Unemployed hooligans occupied the area and took the opportunity to extort money, harming travelers. Ultimately, there were too many management agencies, causing numerous obstacles in management. In order to achieve unified command, the Bureau plans to establish a dock management committee composed of relevant agencies to improve the situation. Various regulations are currently being drafted. Seventh, actively carry out various statistical tasks to make them easier to understand.</p>
<p>Road Construction</p>
<p>Can you tell us about the progress of road construction projects? (Answer) Regarding road construction, it is the most important aspect of the Bureau's recent policy implementations. The current road construction project is about to begin. The main project is the construction of the Su-Hu (Suzhou-Shanghai) Highway. The city is responsible for the section from Shanghai to Gu Pu Bridge, which is about 26 kilometers. The section west of the bridge is the responsibility of Jiangsu Province. The project is divided into three sections, with one section chief for each section, working within the specified boundaries. The surveying and demarcation are currently underway. The load standard for this section of the road is 10 metric tons. The road will eventually connect to Nanjing. At the same time, the construction of the Hu-Hang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) Highway is also being planned. The first section to be constructed is the Shanghai-Songjiang section. Zhejiang Province is also sending personnel to inspect the plan. In addition, the North Xizang Road to North Railway Station Road surface is also being planned. Road construction within the urban area will begin soon.</p>
<p>The procedures for applying for construction projects and other licenses seem to be slow. How does your bureau plan to improve this? (Answer) Due to the communication with various bureaus and the complexity of sending personnel to inspect and investigate, the issuance of licenses takes up to a week. We absolutely do not intentionally make things difficult. If any of our staff members are intentionally delaying or extorting, please report it at any time for thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Two Roads</p>
<p>What is the operating status of the Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads, and the city ferry? (Answer) First, regarding the operating status of the Shangchuan and Shangnan Roads, it has been quite good recently. In the past, the municipal government adopted the principle of self-sufficiency for the two roads to maintain expenses. Recently, not only can they be self-sufficient, but they also have a monthly surplus that is turned over to the municipal treasury, amounting to more than 10 million yuan. The rails, sleepers, and passenger seats of the two roads have been repaired and replaced. Regardless of military police, government personnel, or heavy vehicles, all are required to purchase tickets. The total monthly revenue of the two roads is about 50 to 60 million yuan. Second, the operating status of the city ferry was good in the first half of last year, with a surplus of more than 300,000 yuan. However, in the second half of last year, due to fuel, ship routes, increased employee salaries, and huge expenses, the surplus in the first half of the year was lost, with a deficit of more than 100,000 yuan. However, the business for the past year has improved again, which can make up for this loss and even have some surplus.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Inspection</p>
<p>What are your impressions of having inspected various affiliated agencies? (Answer) Due to time constraints, I only inspected two-thirds of them this time. The motivation for this trip was to inspect warehouse materials and to see if there were any corrupt practices in vehicle registration. The results of this trip, in general, show that the following points should be improved: First, actively strengthen personnel management, select talents carefully, and assign specialized technical personnel separately. Second, plan for material replenishment and repair damaged factory buildings.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Prepares to Establish Business Tax Assessment Committee, Candidate Committee Members Are Being Nominated Separately</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau levies business tax in the city based on two standards: the total business income and the business capital of each industry. Now, the Bureau believes that many businesses are reporting inaccurate capital amounts. To avoid disputes, it has decided to actively prepare for the establishment of a Business Tax Assessment Committee in accordance with Article 9 of the Bureau's Business Tax Regulations: "If the business tax collection agency believes that the declared total business income or business capital is inaccurate, it may establish a Business Tax Assessment Committee to assess it when necessary." It is understood that the quota of the committee has been set at five people. In addition to three of them being appointed by the Bureau, the remaining two have been decided to be appointed by the Municipal Advisory Committee and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each nominating one person to participate. The Bureau has sent letters to the above two agencies to determine the candidate committee members as soon as possible and to reply with the names of the representatives. It is reported that the Bureau is drafting the organization and assessment rules of the assessment committee.</p>

<h3>General Anami, Minister of the Army of Japan</h3>
<p>— Kintzaburo Takagaki</p>
<p>"Morality and righteousness are the strength of war." This is General Anami's consistent argument.</p>
<p>In the outline of the operation's code of conduct, "Consistent cooperation is the most important thing to achieve combat goals..." This certainly emphasizes the importance of cooperative operations, but the morality and sense of righteousness of each corps and army, especially in large-scale corps and army operations, are the most important.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the general was ordered to cooperate with Lieutenant General Sakai's South China Army on a certain front to attack Hong Kong. At this time, although our Japanese army was constantly advancing towards Hong Kong, because the Chongqing army attempted to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army, it was necessary to contain the Chongqing army's attempt. However, various conditions at that time made it very difficult to carry out this cooperative operation. Nevertheless, the general disregarded the great sacrifices of the army and, from the standpoint of morality and righteousness, overcame all difficulties for the friendly army and provided assistance. Behind the famous Battle of Hong Kong, there is actually such a beautiful story. This proves that it completed a very important task.</p>
<p>In addition, in the North China Front and the South Pacific Front, the traces of the general's use of troops always depict the rough lines of the above-mentioned arguments.</p>
<p>This creed is not the general's tactical thought, but also the main trunk of his outlook on life and ethics. The general's high prestige may be due to the influence of the martyr Tachibana Chūsa in his childhood school days, but he always treats people with morality and righteousness. This may be naturally produced from the fundamental attitude of daily life.</p>
<p>In swordsmanship, he is a hero of five or six dan. In addition, he is particularly good at archery and pistol shooting. The general's creed in this regard is the principle of sword swings without hesitation and bullets without fail. In training soldiers, he also advocates not to seek many goals, but to make sure that when the sword swings, an opponent will fall down, and when a bullet is fired, an opponent's chest will bleed. This is the best policy.</p>
<p>Don't fight small battles, it is best to use the Mount Tai pressing-down style to hit the face. This style is also reflected in his work. No matter what problems he encounters, he first makes a light and heavy judgment, and then bravely moves forward according to his own consideration.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of people around the general, who is entrusted with great expectations, expressing their opinions. But one day, a general was worried about the decline of the world and told the general with great sadness. At this time, the general tapped the table lightly and clearly, saying:</p>
<p>"Zhou Taigong said, 'Don't cry!'"</p>
<p>It is said that the general's short sentence that came out of his mouth naturally made the general completely enlightened, which proves that General Anami has an extraordinary capacity.</p>
<p>In the current situation, the cruel traces of the enemy's American bombing can certainly show the style of the martyrs who died heroically, but the general said to someone:</p>
<p>"People often praise the beauty of cherry blossoms when they fall, which symbolizes warriors, but this is not entirely true. The true beauty of cherry blossoms is not in one petal, but as Fujita Tōko said, 'When it blooms, it becomes ten thousand cherry blossoms...' Motoori Norinaga said in the phrase 'The morning light fills the mountains with cherry blossoms,' it is in the full bloom of mountains and valleys. This is the great act of iron-like unity of the Yamato nation at the critical moment of the rise and fall of the imperial country, which is nothing but the expression of the Yamato heart."</p>
<p>In the great battle on the Japanese mainland that will take place in the near future, this is a great gamble war with the eternal fate of the Yamato nation as a stake. In order to win this great national war, the military and the civilian population must not allow any opposition to occur. The center of the war is the real overall strength, which is harmony, that is, the mutual trust of 100 million people.</p>
<p>We have infinite expectations for the new Army Minister Anami, who is full of sincerity and courage. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Sea and Air Special Attack Forces, the Natural Enemy of the Enemy's American Quantity Tactics</h3>
<p>Completely Overturning Quantity Tactics</p>
<p>In the past, the strength of fleet aviation was always inferior to that of base air power, but today the enemy Americans have broken this old concept with quantity. They boast that the amount of quantity determines everything in this war. Just as the momentum tactic was almost regarded as an immutable golden rule in modern warfare, the Japanese Special Attack Forces suddenly appeared, completely overturning this concept. We must know that the attack method of the Special Attack Forces is not compiled as a tactic. The special attack method established by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Force in the Philippines has an important nature that can determine the rise and fall of the country in the Battle of Okinawa.</p>
<p>The key to the Battle of Okinawa is how long the Japanese special attack attacks can continue to strike the enemy's quantity. The enemy Americans tasted the taste of the Japanese special attack attack in the Philippines front. Due to the suicide attacks of the Japanese Navy Kamikaze Special Attack Force and the Army Fugaku Mandala Special Attack Force and other special attack forces, the concept of quantity tactics that the enemy Americans have absolutely believed in has also been shaken, which is undeniable. The enemy Americans almost dispatched all their forces in the Battle of Okinawa, which obviously included the Japanese special attack attack in the budget. This time, they dispatched 1,100 ships and almost used all the power of the Pacific Fleet. They believe that with such a huge quantity, even the special attack attack cannot help it. The Japanese army, on the other hand, held the belief that they would surely die, regardless of the amount, they would destroy it. Therefore, the core of the Battle of Okinawa can be said to be the duel between the American material belief and the Japanese special attack belief. These two opposing beliefs are the essence of this air and naval decisive battle in Okinawa.</p>
<p>Preparation Attacks Futile</p>
<p>To prevent the Japanese special attack force's planes from launching, the enemy Americans specially dispatched their mobile units to attack the Japanese Kyushu air base group on March 18th and 19th before landing on Okinawa. On that day, the cumulative number of carrier-based aircraft dispatched reached 1,500. On the 27th and 28th, about 500 carrier-based battleships flew again from Kyushu to the south. During this period, B29s flying from the Mariana Islands base continuously raided on the 27th, with a cumulative total of more than 200 aircraft day and night. In addition to attacking the Tachiarai airfield, they also laid mines in the Seto Inland Sea to obstruct the Japanese warships from launching. By the 31st, hundreds of B29s attacked the Tachiarai and Omura airfields again. After more than ten days of fierce air raids, the enemy Americans thought that the Japanese air power was on the verge of collapse, so they began to invade the Okinawa Islands on April 1st. However, the enemy's American preparation attack was futile. Regarding this point, it can be understood from the fact that after the enemy Americans landed, the Japanese Air Force launched dozens or even hundreds of special attack forces to attack fiercely every day, and the Japanese aquatic special attack ships broke through their mines and then launched majestically.</p>
<p>In the midst of the fierce battle between the enemy's mobile units and the Japanese special attack flying teams, the air decisive battle over Okinawa entered the second stage of the decisive battle. The fierce attack by the Japanese air special attack force that began on the 6th finally forced the enemy Americans to frankly admit that they had "experienced the biggest air raid in the Pacific War," and issued a "If this continues for two weeks, our Okinawa operation may become a lost move" cry of grief. The activities of the Japanese special attack flying team did not stop even on the three days of April 8th, 9th and 10th when the weather was bad. On the 11th, when the weather improved, it launched a total assault again. During this period, the water special attack team, which had been preparing for a long time, also continued to launch from Okinawa Island, causing the enemy Americans to issue a "Strictly prevent Japanese suicide boats" warning signal.</p>
<p>Base Power Undiminished</p>
<p>Due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese sea and air forces, and the fierce battles of the ground troops, the enemy's losses increased day by day, and they became anxious and restless. Therefore, on April 8th, they dispatched carrier-based aircraft to fly to Kagoshima to indiscriminately bomb the special attack base and the city street area. However, the power of the Japanese air base group was not diminished at all, and the special attack team's attacks became even more violent.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the remaining aircraft carrier group, which had not shown its attitude in the nearby sea until now, suddenly appeared and launched another attack on the Japanese air base. This was obviously an adventurous move by the enemy in order to avoid being attacked by more severe special attack teams and to achieve a more thorough collapse. The enemy aircraft carrier group that appeared on that day was divided into three groups, containing six aircraft carriers, which can be regarded as the entire strength of its remaining mobile units. Why did the enemy Americans dispatch their precious troops? From the afternoon of this day, an aviation team composed of various fighter-bombers, such as P51, P40, B25, and B24, flew from the Okinawa base and fiercely attacked the Japanese air base. What was this for? Isn't this a sign that the Japanese special attack attack for two consecutive weeks has been victorious?</p>
<p>The enemy Americans were so anxious that they launched this attack, risking their remaining mobile units in a desperate attempt to destroy the enemy. The opportunity to destroy the enemy, which the enemy had created themselves, was excellent! The anxiety and restlessness of the enemy Americans is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Japan to destroy the enemy. Today, from Okinawa to the South Kyushu Sea, the Japanese and American sides are using all their means to fight hard. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun on April 18th)</p>
<h3>Aerial Decisive Battle over Okinawa Island</h3>
<p>Since the start of the Okinawa operation, the enemy fleet and mobile force surrounding Okinawa Island have suffered tremendous damage daily due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air and naval forces. Disregarding sacrifices, the American forces desperately resupply their landed troops. Simultaneously, hundreds of carrier-based planes are constantly deployed in lines between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island, attempting to block attacks by the Japanese air forces. However, the Japanese air forces, primarily consisting of Kamikaze special attack units, along with naval and land units, continued their extremely fierce attacks after the weather improved on April 11th. They constantly engaged the enemy fleet and land forces around Okinawa, inflicting significant damage. Currently, the situation surrounding Okinawa has reached its climax in the sea, on land, and in the air.</p>
<p>From the 12th onwards, the elite Japanese fighter squadrons moved south along the Ryukyu Islands chain, broke through the enemy carrier-based aircraft defense lines, and launched a magnificent aerial decisive battle. In the meantime, due to continuous attacks by special attack units, the assaults on enemy ships and mobile forces intensified. The publicly announced results from the 12th to the 15th inclusive, reported the sinking of thirteen enemy vessels of unspecified type, one of which was a large vessel, most likely an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>The significant characteristic of this aerial decisive battle is that all Japanese aircraft dispatched were special attack aircraft. They carried out attacks with the resolve to completely expend all aircraft, striving to deliver a fatal blow to the enemy. (Translated from the April 18th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Southern Okinawa Island</h3>
<p>Regarding the Okinawa battle, the enemy has been focusing their attacks on the southern part of the island, such as Naha, Itoman, Minato, Nakama, Maeda, Kadena, and the two northern and central airfields, despite having secured landing points on Ie Island, the Kerama Islands, Tsushima, and other islands around Okinawa Island. Fierce battles have been raging in this area in recent days. According to the Japanese announcement on the 10th of this month, the enemy forces in southern Okinawa began a fierce offensive on the 8th of this month simultaneously at Nakama, Maeda, and Makiminato, north of Shuri. Thanks to the Japanese army's advantageous terrain, coupled with the cooperation of air attack units, the enemy forces continued to suffer significant defeats. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to completely occupy Okinawa has ultimately become a dream.</p>
<h3>Rescuing the Urgent vs. Rescuing the Poor</h3>
<p>— Zhou Bangjun</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Rescue the urgent, not the poor." Saving the urgent is limited to a specific time, while saving the poor is an endless task. Those who need "urgent" help may require assistance due to the inability to actively manage funds or may need to borrow money due to unforeseen circumstances; rescuing the poor is different, the uses are undefined, there is no continuous source of support, and begging has no end. Therefore, saving the urgent is mostly active assistance, while saving the poor is mostly passive giving.</p>
<p>Looking at Shanghai today, the number of impoverished masses is increasing daily, and the soaring prices of daily necessities and manufacturer layoffs are the causes. Therefore, relief cannot be achieved solely through material and economic support. The focus should be on preventing and prohibiting layoffs, which is the main countermeasure to eliminate and prevent the increase in the number of impoverished masses. In reality, with the lack of materials and power restrictions, even with great effort, it is impossible to stabilize prices. Manufacturers, facing huge expenses and heavy taxes, cannot maintain operations without layoffs. Therefore, the solution lies first in opening up the sources of materials to ensure supply, prevent price increases, and lower prices. Secondly, taxes should be adjusted to reduce the burden on manufacturers. If these steps are taken, the number of impoverished masses may not increase further.</p>
<p>In short, rescuing the poor is more important than rescuing the urgent. During this period, measures are difficult. Even with sufficient financial resources, material resources may still be insufficient. Therefore, to ensure social order and the welfare of the public, we can work together on the following points to effectively address both the root and branch causes of urgent and poverty relief:</p>
<p>1. Unification of Administrative Agencies: Recently, there has been a proliferation of agencies, whose nature is inevitably similar, but the management methods are different, the regulations are different, difficult to comply with, and difficult to deal with, which makes manufacturers annoyed. Therefore, they cease operation, resulting in the increase of the impoverished masses. In order to alleviate the difficulties of manufacturers, the administrative agencies must be unified urgently, if fewer manufactures cease operation, the unemployed impoverished masses would not increase so much.</p>
<p>2. Eliminate the Obstacles to Material Transport: Due to the scarcity of materials, blood forms the high prices. At present, there is no way to suppress it except to encourage imports and eliminate the harm of imports. Therefore, the materials imported to Shanghai should be facilitated as much as possible. Public officials' obstruction and extortion should be strictly prohibited, and the numerous checkpoints on waterways should be immediately eliminated. Without this plan, there will be layer upon layer of exploitation, making transportation a fearful task, and the source of supplies will inevitably be exhausted. How can we reduce the price?</p>
<p>3. Establish Factories for Daily Necessities: Raise funds, use public buildings in the suburbs, accommodate the poor, investigate available materials, and establish various handicraft factories, so that everyone has the opportunity to support themselves.</p>
<p>4. Strengthen Vocational Introduction Agencies: All industrial and commercial enterprises, both existing and new, that organize vocational introduction agencies should establish close contact. All job seekers should first register, and in addition to their intelligence and skills, also collect information about their family situation and send people to investigate their past performance and personality. Then assign based on ability, or provide appropriate guidance, so that people can make the best of their talents and make the best use of their talents.</p>
<p>The above may not be a perfect cure-all, but if we can prevent or reduce the number of impoverished people, we can increase the wealth of the country. Therefore, rescuing the urgent and rescuing the poor is a fundamental plan to preserve the nation's vitality.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Third District of the Naval Baojia in Pudong</h3>
<p>— Pan Guangzhen</p>
<p>The Pudong Naval Baojia has been preparing since March and was officially established on April 1. In terms of operations, it sometimes follows the path of the Pudong South District Public Office Baojia and the police station Baojia. Therefore, the naval Baojia's promotion of various tasks is relatively smooth. The preliminary work in the third district has now reached a stage, and a brief report on the general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>District Boundaries: The Pudong Naval Baojia currently has three districts: 1, 2, and 3. The third district has the smallest area and the fewest people. It stretches from Yangjing Port in the east to Minsheng Road Laoyakou in the west, Huaiqianda Port in the south, and the Huangpu River in the north (shaped like a boot foot), covering an area of about 6,000 mu, with a total of 20 Bao, 198 Jia, 2,634 households, and 13,021 people.</p>
<p>Baojia Personnel: The district office is located at 122 Fangbang Road, Yangjing Town, with three clerks, all of whom are employed. Each Bao has one Bao chief, for a total of 20 people. Each Jia has one Jia chief, for a total of 198 people. The Bao and Jia chiefs are all unpaid positions.</p>
<p>Household Registration Compilation: The household registration in the third district has now been completed. For this work, we have benefited greatly from the efforts and experience of the Bao and Jia chiefs.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Self-Defense Corps: The town-run self-defense corps has been temporarily suspended due to the transition period. The district has now taken over part of it, including 11 watchtowers, 7 whistles, 11 ropes, 20 cotton coats, and 8 raincoats. After repairs and replenishment, they can be used. The number of self-defense corps members is being selected according to regulations, and a comprehensive plan will be fairly put into action soon.</p>
<p>Air Defense Equipment: The town originally had very complete air defense equipment, but since the person in charge left his post without permission, and no one was responsible, everything has collapsed. The district should take over the part, but it is unwilling to hand it over. If the district were to set it up on its own, it would be redundant and a burden on the people. Moreover, the district has wasted resources, which is not in line with the people's feelings of saving. The district's most important air defense affairs have been delayed due to personnel matters and have not yet been realized.</p>
<p>Organizing the Youth Corps: The town originally had a Youth Corps, with one squadron and three detachments. The detachment addresses are all outside the jurisdiction of the third district, and the members' addresses are also outside the jurisdiction. Therefore, it cannot be used, and it is necessary to reorganize it. As soon as the regulations are issued, enthusiastic young people will be selected to take on this work.</p>
<p>Collecting Baojia Fees: The Baojia fees in this district have been collected, and the deadline for the March and April payments is the end of April. The Baojia fees are divided into several types: 100 yuan, 200 yuan, 400 yuan, 600 yuan, 800 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. This district is a poor rural area, so except for shops, the average monthly fee per household is 100 yuan. Those who are truly poor and unable to produce, can apply for exemption after obtaining proof from the Bao chief.</p>
<p>Establishing a Cooperative: The Naval Baojia authorities, in order to ensure the stable lives of Baojia personnel and increase work efficiency, have organized a Naval Baojia Personnel Cooperative. In the near future, a ration system will be implemented. Bao chiefs in this district who join the cooperative will soon be able to enjoy this right.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The preliminary work in the third district may not have achieved the ideal results, but some progress has been made. I am in charge of the district chief's position, and I feel that my ability is limited. If we are to promote the second step of work, we still need to rely on the continued efforts of all Baojia personnel and the continued cooperation of local agencies and gentry.</p>
<h3>A Small Suggestion</h3>
<p>— Gonggan</p>
<p>The evacuation movement has been going on for more than two months, but there has been no great effect so far, and inconvenient transportation is naturally the main reason. It is still difficult to move people in, let alone move families. Think about how many wooden boxes, suitcases and sundries a family has, big and small? If you want to move all of them, the freight will probably be greater than the value of the things themselves, or simply cannot be transported. If you throw them all away, you can't bear to. If you sell them to second hand merchants, the price will be terribly devalued and you will get little in return. As a result, people are still hesitant and slow to act because they "can't bear to part with them and can't run away." To remedy this defect, in addition to smoothing transportation as much as possible, I think there are three solutions:</p>
<p>Establish a Moving and Transportation Department: The government should contact Yonglu Transportation agencies to provide low-cost transportation services specifically for those returning to their hometowns to transport furniture and sundries. At the same time, it should try to maintain safe navigation and avoid all kinds of unnecessary losses.</p>
<p>Establish a Furniture Purchasing Office for Returning Citizens: Purchase the furniture of those returning to their hometowns at fair prices to facilitate evacuation; and then sell it on to others.</p>
<p>Establish a Return Assistance Fund: Use government or social forces to raise funds to subsidize those who cannot afford to return to their hometowns and those who cannot afford to transport their furniture back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Of the three solutions above, the second is the most practical. The establishment of the institution can be divided into three parts:</p>
<p>Receiving Department—Set up receiving departments in various districts and invite clerks from various businesses in the city to act as voluntary appraisers. Those returning to their hometowns who are willing to sell their furniture can apply to the department to purchase it; after receiving the application, the department investigates to make sure that the applicant is indeed returning to their hometown, and can send appraisers to appraise and purchase it on their behalf. The principle of pricing is not to let the citizens suffer too much loss.</p>
<p>Auction Department—Simultaneously set up an auction department in each district to be responsible for selling. Auction the goods received to the public; charge a small commission as an expense.</p>
<p>Transportation Department—Items purchased that cannot be sold locally; can be transported to nearby rural areas for public sale; at the same time, it can also make up for the current shortage of supplies in the countryside.</p>
<p>As for the initial capital for purchases, the municipal government can apply for credit loans from money shops and banks. Although the program is too idealistic, if it can be implemented, the evacuation movement can proceed smoothly.</p>
<h3>Teacher's Tram Fare</h3>
<p>In the decisive stage of the war, the lives of ordinary salaried people are under serious pressure, especially primary school teachers, and I am one of them. I suffer from pain and cannot express it in words. Since Mr. Dai Yingfu has served as the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, he has worked hard to improve the salaries of municipal primary school teachers, increasing them to around 20,000 yuan, and providing them with three pecks of rice per month in accordance with the treatment of civil servants. Although life cannot be fully maintained, being able to enjoy such treatment is already very good during this wartime, and we are very grateful for the care and concern of the education authorities.</p>
<p>However, since May 1, tram fares have increased. The daily fare is 1,000 yuan for those who need more trips or at least 300 yuan for those who need fewer trips. As for me, I need 900 yuan every day. If I buy a monthly pass for 24,000 yuan, it would be 12,000 yuan if it were calculated at half price for civil servants (primary school teacher's salary is between 15,000 and 20,000 yuan per month). I hope that the municipal government (not only the Education Bureau, but also the civil servants of other bureaus) can find a better solution. It would be best for civil servants to ride the tram completely free of charge, following the example of the current personnel of the Inspection Bureau; otherwise, they should be allowed to purchase military tickets for 15 yuan each to reduce the burden. (A teacher)</p>
<h3>Civil Servants' Treatment Issues</h3>
<p>— Yao Gengxuan</p>
<p>Since Vice President Zhou took over as mayor of Shanghai, he has greatly reorganized the city's various administrative agencies and has also made corresponding adjustments to the treatment of civil servants, especially the administrative personnel in police and finance, who are treated better than average. Past cases of embezzlement, extortion, and door-to-door solicitation have largely ceased, and it can be said that considerable progress has been made.</p>
<p>According to the information announced in the newspapers after the adjustment, each person receives at least 18,000 yuan in salary in addition to the three pecks of rice distributed free of charge (police officers receive from two and a half to six pecks), which was enough to get by at the time. However, the general price level has now increased by about four or five times compared with that time, but the treatment of civil servants has not been correspondingly adjusted due to financial reasons. This is an issue worthy of attention.</p>
<p>According to my friends, only the staff of the municipal government itself and the Finance Bureau are living relatively stable lives. For the majority of the staff in other agencies, apart from senior and middle-level staff, it is difficult to maintain the minimum living standard for a family with their salaries, so it is no wonder that there are many complaints.</p>
<p>These grassroots civil servants are the part of the administrative agency that is closest to the public, and whether their lives are stable or not directly affects the work they do. If they do not work hard, then even with the leadership and guidance of excellent senior officials, they will be powerless. Therefore, in my opinion, I hope that the authorities will make a statistical report on the civil servants' cost of living index every month so that the salaries of most staff can maintain a reasonable ratio with the price level, so that their lives have sufficient protection, so that the past bad phenomenon does not reappear.</p>

<h3>The Way Out</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>On the small table in front of me lies a silver-red invitation card.</p>
<p>I no longer feel surprised in my heart. Shouldn't this be a very ordinary thing? If I could find the time to have a glass of wedding wine, wouldn't that be pleasant? Yet, it always feels as if a rope is binding my heart, making me feel a restrained disturbance. I haven't understood where this disturbance comes from, nor do I have a reason to explain it. I cannot admit that this has a hint of selfishness. I only sincerely grieve for her deceiving herself with empty words, regardless of whether she believes this is happiness. This is a common thing in life, yet in this ordinariness, I see an internal change in her. How much time can change those with wavering wills! Why did she have to change? Weren't we walking together before? And from her words and actions, I once glimpsed that bold, forward-looking spirit. How can I believe that she would turn around? But she has indeed changed, changed so quickly, that she didn't even give me time to know! I closed my eyes, as if walking on a withered road, suddenly I could no longer hear that loud call, and when I looked back, I had lost that agile figure in the desolate wilderness. Alas, I have lost another companion, and I feel an unbearable loneliness.</p>
<p>People say that marriage is a woman's ultimate destination. Although I don't believe this, I do think that a woman doesn't necessarily have to say goodbye to her career after marriage. Perhaps I shouldn't be disturbed by this invitation card. I should force out a calm smile to bless her, wishing her a happy marriage. But I feel that the surrounding air is solemn, so quiet that it stifles all sounds, not allowing me to laugh. I looked up at the window. Outside the window, it was a beautiful, sunny day. Bright sunlight shone on my table. My eyes fell, and I caught another glimpse of the invitation card, which appeared even more vibrant in the sunlight. Ah, isn't this a familiar scene? I wanted to recall this familiar scene in my memory. Only then did I remember that just less than a year ago, I was also sitting by this window, with bright sunlight shining in. I eagerly unfolded her letter. The clean, white stationery shimmered in the sunlight, as vividly as today's invitation card. I read word by word:</p>
<p>"...I received your letter, and I know that you still care about me so much, but you are too excessively praising me. In fact, how could I have the hope and potential that you say I have? I remember when we were young, we were playful and loving, without any barriers. But now I can't help but suspect that you have unconsciously picked up the perfunctory habits of adults who have adapted to society. Because from your words, I see that you lack genuine sympathy for me, and perhaps even harbor some envy. Oh, why don't you still treat me with the attitude you had when we were young? You should directly point out my mistakes, state your frank opinions, and understand my situation more deeply, offering sympathy and comfort. Think about it, I am someone who has never received affection since childhood, and has been trapped in my family, living a bleak life. Now I have finally managed to enter the senior normal school, but it is really just for the sake of making a living in the future. How can I talk about having a promising future? Of course, I have had a special love for teaching since I was a child, and I really hope that I can make some achievements in the education field in the future, but due to limited financial ability, I can no longer pursue further studies, so that enthusiasm has cooled down by half. I want to confide in others, but I think only you are my childhood confidant, and you will definitely understand me, but who knew it would be like this again, it really makes me feel sad! You say that I am about to graduate, which should be a cause for joy, but I am worried about graduating. Originally, I was deeply afraid that I would not be able to take on this important work of education, and coupled with the current meager salaries of teachers, I am even more afraid that I will not be able to exchange my labor for a bowl of rice. Moreover, I am a woman, an incompetent woman, with no relatives to rely on, and only a stubborn mother left. How can she help me? But precisely because I am a poor woman, I am indignant at the various oppressions that women suffer in society. I don't believe that women cannot be independent in society, and I don't accept that women are subordinate to men, only using beauty and flattery to win the ugly and contemptible favor of men. I think that women today seem to have jumped out of the circle of feudal forces in words, but in fact, women in poverty are no better off than women in the past! (Of course, some wealthy so-called 'liberated' ladies are just enjoying more of the materials of the new century, creating a larger batch of slaves to serve them.) We are subject to multiple oppressions, and under these pressures, I am still gasping for breath, groping on uneven paths, and unable to find a broad and flat road. The way out, the way out, is there really no way out for women born in darkness? No matter how harsh the environment, I must strive for my way out, as well as the way out for all unfortunate women! On this, I ask for your help, hoping that you will treat me more sincerely, not abandon me, and warmly reach out your hand to me..."</p>
<p>I remember that after I finished reading this letter, I was deeply moved. I seemed to see her standing tall, raising her arms, and shouting loudly. Her face still had traces of undried tears, and her bright eyes sparkled with the light of hope. Ah, her posture was so moving, her voice was so full of strength, I really wanted to run to her side and warmly kiss her, sincerely tell her that I loved her, helped her, and gave her my great respect!</p>
<p>I remember that I immediately replied to her with a letter, pouring out my enthusiasm to her. At that time, I really thought she was my best friend. But after that, I never received another letter from her for a long time. I was concerned about her life and current situation, and I wrote letters to ask from time to time, but there was no news. This made me feel strange and uneasy mixed with disappointment. After some time passed, I accidentally heard some news about her from a fellow villager, saying that she had been betrothed to the young master of a wealthy merchant, and that the wedding would be held next spring, and that she would stop studying this winter. When I heard this at the time, I was very surprised, but later I smiled dismissively, thinking that this was just a joke about her. Although she was already nineteen years old, for the sake of her way out, for the sake of her long-cherished aspirations, for the sake of her career, she believed that she would never abandon her unfinished studies to go to the side of a man who did not understand her heart, sell her freedom, confine herself to her bridal chamber, and enjoy corrupt happiness! What's more, she would never forget me - not to say that I was her lover, that she should only love me and not love others, but to say that she should know that I have the courage to move forward, a righteous stance, and dare to grope on small roads, and would not stop until I had found a way out for humanity! As for whether she regarded me as her lover, or whether she must succeed in love with me, that was never what I cared about?</p>
<p>Doubting this news, another year passed in a hurry. This spring, I still didn't receive a letter from her. Because I was so busy with things, I was too lazy to write a letter. I waited, waited, and finally today I received this "red" news, this red invitation card!</p>
<p>Ah, she did marry the son of that wealthy merchant!</p>
<p>Her actions were out of the blue, and this unexpected attack left me cold and speechless. A spark of anger burst out in the wordlessness, but then it returned to calm. Yes, what can I blame her for? When she was young, she was timid and weak-willed. In the depths of her heart, she still harbored the earnest admonitions of her mother, who was the embodiment of Confucian ethics. Later, it was hard for her to learn about the new trends of the world from other friends, and to understand the true meaning of life. However, in the end, because she still had a sweet aftertaste for the old remnants, and loved her mother more than the new world, she wanted to win her mother's favor with her filial piety, so that her mother could enjoy the blessings of her old age. So she quietly bid farewell to her fellow travelers, and fell into the arms of a wastrel, following her mother's wishes! Perhaps a woman doesn't necessarily have to say goodbye to her career after marriage. Of course, I am willing to sincerely see that she does not forget her words of a year ago, and give me this belief with the proof of facts. However, if she really does this, she will have to abandon her happiness after marriage and prepare to accept new pains. In that case, this is not what I should say to her when she invites me to have wedding wine.</p>
<p>I have seen how many enthusiastic young people, determined to find their way out, finally turned around and threw themselves into their "destination." In the "destination," there seemed to be affectionate comfort and the sweetness of family affection. Thus, those who dared to cut through thorns and brambles to open up a flat way out for themselves and for humanity temporarily felt the news of loneliness. However, looking up into the distance, I faintly saw a glimmer of light beyond the horizon. I resolutely stood up, waved away the unnamed disturbance of being bound, and couldn't help but smile again in my heart.</p>
<p>The way out, is there really no way out?</p>
<h3>Remembering South Lake</h3>
<p>— Qing Zeng</p>
<p>Jiaxing, the central station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the second railway to be completed in our country, is such a mysterious and beautiful ancient city! That's right! Fifteen years ago, she was still surrounded by winding city walls, and the middle section of the main street of the county still retained the great and solemn, but now dead and silent, yamen. Although there are no longer the shouts and fierce yamen runners of the past inside, the pair of stone lions in front of the gate are still baring their teeth and claws as always. On Ping Mountain, not far from the yamen, an iron-rusted, copper-green, thickly accumulated earth cannon stands high... Everything reveals a mysterious and classical beauty. Within the breeding of these beauties, there is a well-known South Lake.</p>
<p>South Lake! She is not as heavily made up as the Qinhuai Lake, nor does she have the pleasure boats like clouds of the West Lake, but her beauty of being free from vulgarity makes the world-famous West Lake and Qinhuai Lake willingly take a back seat. Look! She has clear, bottomless neighboring waves, layers of solemn palaces in the heart of the lake, steles hidden under embracing trees, and the Eastern Pagoda standing far away... She can make travelers linger, she can make tourists intoxicated.</p>
<p>On the north shore of this famous lake, there is a tall building echoing the palaces in the lake from afar. This is my home. He is a forever young warrior, standing巍峨independently in the long years. She knew my young grandmother, saw my father at birth, and of course she was even more familiar with the happy me at that time—that's right! She saw me with a kind grandmother and loving parents, who nurtured me like this, and cultivated me like this.</p>
<p>Every evening, when the setting sun fell and the evening smoke curled up, my father liked to wander on the willow embankment by the lake, waiting for me to come home from school. From afar, I opened my little hands and jumped into his arms. Then he habitually took off my schoolbag, happily asked about the schoolwork, or told an interesting story. I leaned on him, gazed at the beauty of nature, and listened to relaxed and interesting stories. Time passed in our happy laughter, and the bells of the temple on the opposite lake echoed in the empty space of the lake, and the night gradually unfolded in the solemn, slow bells. Only then did we reluctantly embark on the way home.</p>
<p>When the hot summer came, South Lake embraced various yachts from morning to night. The railway opened special trains for tourists, and the boat girls competed to attract tourists, rowed their painted boats, and our family's dinner was often happily enjoyed on the blue waves. The heat of the sun was driven away outside the awning of the boat, and the cool breeze blew unobstructed from the water, bringing the sound of gurgling water and intoxicating laughter. At dusk, when the charming moon rose and the stars first appeared, many yachts left with tired voices, staggering away and slowly drifting away. Returning to the quiet South Lake, she was like a maiden with silent affection, adding a bit more charm and tenderness. At this time, I loved to listen to my grandmother or mother telling stories about South Lake. The stories were so extensive! The palaces in the heart of the lake, she had stayed the traces of Sui Yangdi and Qianlong's travels, the clear blue water, he had even reflected the shadows of Xi Shi and Fan Li, I listened excitedly and curiously! Listening! The moon had already stolen over our heads, I stared at the palaces bathed in silver light, and the lakes filled with mercury, and a string of historical illusions floated in my mind, and my intoxicated heart wandered in the moonlight! Oops! Finally, the soul was called back by the leisurely sound of returning home.</p>
<p>Although my family's courtyard was not dyed with brilliant and magnificent colors, I loved him more than everything else, perhaps because of the mentality that "there is no place like home". The sunny bedroom, he faced the beautiful South Lake squarely, the spacious and bright dining room, it was the place where we laughed during meals. I loved my little studio even more, he was quietly perched in the southeast corner. When I occasionally looked up from my desk, I could see the sails floating on the lake and the distant shadows of the pagoda... All of these made me deeply love, satisfied, and intoxicated.</p>
<p>On the tablet of my young heart, I was able to inscribe and understand my father's often recited poem: "South embraces the beautiful lake light, east welcomes the high pagoda shadow." This sentence praising the scenery of my home is so accurate and appropriate!</p>
<p>Childhood! That happy childhood finally flew away, and even that beautiful home had long become a relic. The old dream like morning glow nine years ago disappeared without a trace. Only the beautiful South Lake, I heard that she is still lonely and quiet. I can't bear to see her, and I don't want to see her, because I imagine that she must be old! She must have turned into a sentimental old woman, because she has seen all the sins and has seen all the vicissitudes. I hate my clumsy brushstrokes, and I can't finish writing the memories that knock on my heartstrings, but this can already give me a moment of satisfaction with the vision in my mind and stir up some beautiful ripples in my heart.</p>
<h3>The Solitary One</h3>
<p>— Liu Lin</p>
<p>Last night, I met him again. I felt his face was familiar. Time had separated me from him, and I felt his visit was abrupt. But in my loneliness, I still treated my guest with a welcoming heart.</p>
<p>He took off his greatcoat, which was full of wind and frost, like an old sail boat removing its sails. He looked around my room: gray walls, gray windows, messy books and furniture, and then he put away his awkward expression.</p>
<p>Memories reminded me that he was a person accustomed to living in solitude, and I had to avoid those polite greetings.</p>
<p>"You haven't changed your solitary nature, have you!"</p>
<p>"It won't change," he said after a long silence. "It's my personality."</p>
<p>I remembered him once saying: "The reason why I am lonely and self-possessed is partly because I grew up in a gloomy house. And when I was young, I didn't have playmates close to my age..." So I asked him:</p>
<p>"Now you shouldn't be fascinated by the spider webs in the corner of the room anymore." "Didn't I tell you before that I love the beautifully decorated fields, the golden rapeseed flowers, and the oily green grass..."</p>
<p>"Yes, you also told me that you were trying to transplant the delicate buds into your heart."</p>
<p>So the face of my friend was also dotted with vibrant green. I seemed to realize that he had also struggled in the whirlpool of life.</p>
<p>"But don't misunderstand me, I still wouldn't presume to that extent: thinking that everything in nature is arranged for me. In the morning, the little birds chirp happily with me. But in the evening, as my eyes follow the crows returning to their nests, I can only comfort myself with a silent sigh, and send away the time of the day."</p>
<p>"Then, can't you control your emotions?"</p>
<p>"Yes—but I have never thought that my life is humble. The heart must have a home; in this way, even in the bitter cold winter, I can still arrange a next spring, a beautiful spring suburb in my fantasy—and in winter, aren't the white snowflakes also lovely?"</p>
<p>"Well, your joyful emotions outweigh your sadness."</p>
<p>My friend lowered his head, and he stared at his own knees with bewildered eyes. In the dim light, I saw his wrinkled soul trembling. He raised his head, but I didn't dare to let my eyes meet his. I shouldn't touch the scars on his heart. Now, I think, what he found in silence may be emptiness, or pain. Who says silence is fulfilling?</p>
<p>I was also silent.</p>
<p>In the relative silence, the little joy brought by the rare meeting disappeared completely.</p>
<p>"But you know, later I also learned to think. Perhaps in thinking, I can find the mystery of emotions."</p>
<p>"Then you can't help but doubt the things around you." I didn't add my note: "Doubt is an incomprehensible brooding."</p>
<p>"Do you think doubt is useless? It at least paints a few strokes on a blank life. It is in the contemplative thoughts of doubt that I can retrieve something from life."</p>
<p>He cast a glance at me with apprehensive eyes: "I said that thinking certainly throws me into the circle of doubt, but, I finally jumped out of this circle again. I got what I wanted to pursue, and also cultivated my desire and longing for pursuit."</p>
<p>"That's great." I realized that it was not normal to follow his thoughts with urgent questions. "I'm afraid what I lack is this desire and longing."</p>
<p>I didn't dare to make a frank expression. Sometimes, out of deceptive comfort and sympathy, it can also bring each other closer, right!</p>
<p>Then he said: "At first, I really believed that life should return to nature, and there should be no anger, joy, and such, just like those stoic philosophers advocated. But later I admired Tolstoy even more, and believed that the beauty of life he advocated lies in spring and love, and what I pursue is this kind of beauty..."</p>
<p>"This kind of beauty is somewhat close to the metaphysical."</p>
<p>"Yes, this is an invisible beauty..."</p>
<p>I couldn't break the dull air. Otherwise, I had endless questions to ask him: "Are we forgivers, lovers, or forgiven, loved ones?"... Thinking of entertaining guests, I was willing to hand him a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Let the moldy cigarette stretch your mind."</p>
<p>He took the cigarette with one hand, and pressed my shoulder tightly with the other, and said enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"You know, in these years, I have always been thinking about you. Sometimes, you give me enthusiasm, and sometimes it is revelation—you shouldn't have forgotten me, right?"</p>
<p>I thought dejectedly that I didn't have to tell him: I rarely think of him.</p>
<h3>Movie Notes</h3>
<p>— Qianghua</p>
<p>After Seeing "Double Pearls in a Sea of People"</p>
<p>Coming out of the theater, I strolled leisurely down the street. Spring was only lingering with its last vestiges, and the night air already carried the scent of early summer. It was still early, and shadows of people intertwined on the street. Something seemed to be rippling in my heart. It was a faint, slightly melancholic feeling that had been picked up from the silver screen.</p>
<p>What I had just watched at the theater was a new film directed and written by Sang Hu, "Double Pearls in a Sea of People." It contained no life-or-death struggles, no thrilling or shocking scenes. The author simply used his keen observation and gentle, graceful techniques to bring the audience into the world he had created. The characters on the screen seemed like people we all knew; their joys and sorrows were closely related to our own. These were characters refined by art, and thus were warm and intimate.</p>
<p>The story was extremely simple: a pair of sisters from the lower middle class, both gentle and intelligent, yet burdened by the hardships of life. They quietly and without complaint shouldered the burdens of the world, walking forward in their ordinary lives. Mr. Sang Hu gave the characters he created the greatest sympathy, and from that wrote a kind of inescapable sadness for the floating world. The female protagonist invited her boyfriend home for dinner, but many unexpected farcical events occurred, eventually leading to a breakup. The older sister lent her new dress, a gift from her lover, to her younger sister, which happened to be seen by the gift-giver, leading to emotional distress. The male protagonist was suffering from romantic troubles and was ordered by his muddleheaded superior to act as a matchmaker between his girlfriend and his superior. … They were all kind and innocent, yet fate mocked them at every turn. Even the most well-intentioned actions often became ridicule for them.</p>
<p>Last year I saw "Long Live the Teacher," and now, after seeing "Double Pearls in a Sea of People," Mr. Sang Hu's progress is very obvious. From a directing perspective, the whole film is harmonious and natural. It flows like clouds and water, returning from splendor to simplicity, which is to say, moving from artificiality to maturity. His greatest achievement is his constant use of thought-provoking humor interspersed throughout, weaving waves of light and darkness that interact and build upon each other. The regrettable thing is that the scenes depicting sadness are not deep enough, thus unintentionally reducing the work's depth and weakening its power to deeply move the heart.</p>
<p>However, I was clearly captivated by that faint melancholy. Walking down the street on this late spring night, I lingered for a long time in that indefinable emotion.</p>
<h3>The Flute Seller</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>In the fading sunlight,</p>
<p>An old man,</p>
<p>Gray hair beneath a torn cap,</p>
<p>The melodious sound of the flute enveloping</p>
<p>The street bathed in the setting sun,</p>
<p>Tenderly enchanting</p>
<p>The souls of passersby,</p>
<p>Closer and closer.</p>
<p>Wrinkled skin, protruding crystalline droplets,</p>
<p>Hazy eyes filled with light sorrow,</p>
<p>You, perhaps, recall the past,</p>
<p>By the green stream, on the fields,</p>
<p>Riding an ox, singing loudly.</p>
<p>Do not,</p>
<p>Chase after him to ask,</p>
<p>If a day's hard work can buy a liter of rice?</p>
<p>Let him walk with his faltering steps,</p>
<p>Let him quietly play his flute,</p>
<p>With a ray of setting sun shining on him, going far, far away.</p>
<h3>Reading "Dreams Under the Stars"</h3>
<p>— Fang Xuan</p>
<p>A writer once said something rather witty: poetry is the "big shot" among literary works. Indeed, why are other parts of literary works packed tightly together, while only a few lines of short poetry occupy a large space? If we simply break up prose and arrange it line by line, or add some riddle-like phrases, and call it "poetry," then there could be nothing more unfair in the world. But fortunately, there are several songsmiths who, in this barren land, "are willing to become earthworms"; their "goods" calm us down. They use language that is neither extravagant nor excessive, along with reasonable rhythms, to awaken the imagination of us readers. Who says that this large blank space is a waste? Following the rhythm of the poetry, isn't it filled with the colors, sounds, emotions, and twists and turns of the story that the author wants to tell?</p>
<p>Poet Ge Qingchun is one who strives in this area. After reading his recently published collection, "Dreams Under the Stars," one cannot help but marvel at the author's magnificent language, expanded vision, and rich imagination. The poet has inexpressible anger and pity for the myriad aspects of human life, and he vents his emotions with his colorful strokes. "One day spring will bring sunlight and flowers, and the south wind will send the signal of poetry, and I will sing and bless you." Think about it, in what kind of mood did he write so many poems? Isn't what he expects what we expect? Aren't his loves and hates our loves and hates?</p>
<p>In "Imprisoned Lion," "Life," "School Opening," "Homesickness," and "Minzi, You Are Still Young," we can glimpse the author's sincere emotions. He is angered by the injustices of the world, and seems to have an irrepressible sorrow, but this sorrow is uplifting, enabling him to further recognize the face of this society. Under the title "Life," he wrote these lines:</p>
<p>Life is like a tired horse that has traveled ten thousand miles,</p>
<p>Stumbling at the city gate,</p>
<p>Even if you are a hero unmatched by ten thousand,</p>
<p>Or a veteran who has been on the battlefield for a long time,</p>
<p>How can you withstand the falling of a thousand-jin gate?</p>
<p>One day, it will crush you</p>
<p>Into a lump of flesh!</p>
<p>In "Homesickness," it is not merely a cry of despair; he paints a bleak picture:</p>
<p>These years, drought and war intertwine,</p>
<p>Wealthy families sell their fields and houses, fearing robbery and theft.</p>
<p>The poor can only wander to other places.</p>
<p>Thinking of my aging parents,</p>
<p>Leaning on the door, longing for their children,</p>
<p>Adding more white hair?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in "Abandoned Infant," the author's artistic conscience is even more evident. He rejects ornate and skilled verses, and instead takes up living colloquial language, writing that a baby is "born from filth, and in filth you will perish." A pitiful tragedy, which he concisely narrates in dozens of lines of poetry, followed by a compassionate cry at the end!</p>
<p>No one will remember you</p>
<p>— except your mother</p>
<p>Nor will anyone have the leisure</p>
<p>To pity you.</p>
<p>Because the cruelty of the world has taught people</p>
<p>That pity cannot save you,</p>
<p>And tears cannot accomplish great things,</p>
<p>The difficulties before them demand that they</p>
<p>Endure even greater hardships to come!</p>
<p>Ge Qingchun's poems are unique in the integrity of their forms and the conciseness of their lines. I would not dare say that his poems have reached the state of ultimate perfection, but on the whole, the various forms of poetry he has written have no major flaws in their technique. In "Dreams Under the Stars," "On the River," "May Rain," "Sunflower," "I Love," and "Dove Bell," we can cite many lovely lines, showing the maturity of his technique, capturing the reader's reverie and giving a feeling of emotional comfort. Especially in the few short lines of "Cold Garden," both the sentence structure and the rhythm show the author's extraordinary talent—:</p>
<p>The days are like tightly strung musical strings,</p>
<p>Rarely having a moment of leisure,</p>
<p>Delightful are the small hands of the children,</p>
<p>Leading me to the desolate, withered garden.</p>
<p>Breaking off a reed as a spear,</p>
<p>The yellow grass all over the ground is</p>
<p>Considered a battlefield.</p>
<p>Recalling the heroic spirit of Zhou Yu at the Battle of Red Cliffs,</p>
<p>I sit on the ground, watching a grass-battle.</p>
<p>Laughing at the heroes on horseback falling off their backs.</p>
<p>The defeated child this time plays</p>
<p>Cao Cao at the burning of the camps!</p>
<p>In short, if Ge Qingchun continues to work hard, he has a future in the "territory of poetry." It is hoped that he will develop his poetic career by recognizing reality and enriching his life, and by telling the sorrows, angers, and laughter that we all share. Then, the gifts he gives us in the future will be able to arouse our resonance even more. (Dreams Under the Stars, published by Fiction Monthly)</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Grandeur and Wonderful Performances: A Commentary on the White Horse vs. Overseas Chinese United Match</h3>
<p>— Special Reporter</p>
<p>For the eighth Welfare Football Match, the authorities invited the White Horse team to compete against the Overseas Chinese United team. Given the strong momentum of this year's Overseas Chinese United team and the rejuvenated lineup of the White Horse team, various circles had been eagerly awaiting this match ever since the news was announced, until the day of the competition (the 10th). Although the match started at 5:00 PM, football fans had already started arriving in droves from 3:00 PM. The great attraction was evident. The purpose of this Welfare Match was to donate to the landlords of Chefu, who benefited greatly. This reporter will provide a commentary on the match and introduce various aspects of the White Horse team.</p>
<p>Cheng Bo'an Discusses the Establishment of White Horse</p>
<p>Considering the impressive reputation of the White Horse team, the reporter interviewed the team's leader, Cheng Bo'an, after the match. Mr. Cheng first discussed the establishment of the White Horse team. It was formed last summer during the Fuhua Cup mini-league organized by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. Its members were top players from the Donghua and Lianyi teams, temporarily named White Horse. With so many talented players, their performance was indeed excellent and breathtaking. This year, the Overseas Chinese United team, composed of righteous generals, repeatedly challenged strong teams. Because of this, the White Horse team had the desire to rise again. They gathered all their members and submitted an application to the Football Association authorities, who approved their participation in the eighth Welfare Match. The team was determined to win, so they conducted practice and review sessions before the match, which resulted in their excellent performance today. As for the White Horse brand of cigarettes produced by Fuhua, it was to commemorate the White Horse team.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Enthusiastic Situation</p>
<p>Due to the great appeal of both teams, the atmosphere was more lively than expected. All radio stations in Shanghai broadcasted the match on that day, which was unprecedented in recent years. Countless fans could listen to the progress of the battle without having to travel back and forth. The white ball used in the match was different from the usual ball. It was dazzling and added to the excitement of the match. It is said that the ball was planned by Xu Zhihao, the White Horse team's strategist, which showed originality and ingenuity. In order to meet the grand occasion, the White Horse authorities specially compiled a special publication, which was distributed to fans on the spot, further increasing their interest. All of these things were rare in other matches.</p>
<p>The Match Process Was Extremely Tense</p>
<p>The battle was delayed until 5:25 PM due to the late arrival of the White Horse team members. White Horse kicked off first, occupying the upwind position. However, with the spirit of each team member, they attacked with all their strength, and their momentum was unmatched. The Overseas Chinese United righteous army was momentarily at a loss, allowing White Horse to trample. Fortunately, goalkeeper Mai Nidi was agile and avoided disaster. The sharpness of the five White Horse forwards was praised by the fans. Unexpectedly, under the circumstances of White Horse's long attack without success, Overseas Chinese United took the lead in the 26th minute thanks to a corner kick opportunity. Vila kicked the ball, and Artomarri successfully headed it in, scoring the first goal. The White Horse team members could not help but lose color. Until just before the end of the first half, luckily, Sun Jinshun responded swiftly, attacked alone, and used his strong footwork to break the net with one kick. Cheers thundered, and the first half ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>In the second half, White Horse switched to the downwind position, and their offensive was even more prosperous. So, one only saw the five forwards charging left and right, the three midfielders blocking the incoming soldiers, the defenders handling with ease, and Zhang Banglun's business became bleak. In the 20th minute, Song Lingsheng and Jia Youliang frequently passed the ball short and drove down, and at the appropriate point, Jia Youliang fed the ball to Sun Jinshun, whose position was excellent, and he was able to use his only foot to perform a wonderful volley. The Overseas Chinese United's goal was broken again. The joy of the audience seemed drunk and crazy. In the 30th minute, Sun Jinshun received another pass from Li and succeeded again. White Horse was leading 3-1. The righteous army was short of breath and unable to rally. However, three minutes before the end of the match, Zhang Lingen carelessly fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Sirati scored the penalty, allowing Overseas Chinese United to chase back one goal. White Horse finally defeated the Overseas Chinese United team, which had a remarkable record this season and had won the Mayor's Cup and International Cup titles, by a score of 3-2. Domestic fans were all delighted.</p>
<p>White Horse Rushed Fiercely, Overseas Chinese United Was Conservative</p>
<p>White Horse had Han Longhai rush back to help, because he knew that the Overseas Chinese United's defense was a deathly guard. With Longhai's fierce rushing, it would be threatening. Therefore, from the moment he came on the field, he absolutely adopted this tactic. As a result, the Overseas Chinese United's defenders tried their best to concentrate on Han Longhai. Luo Xulai could not mark him firmly, so Sirati filled in from behind. Therefore, Sun Jinshun had many opportunities. Li was also active from time to time, so under such circumstances, it was natural for the White Horse forwards to be active. Secondly, Song Ling's forward rushing had the ability to assist in the attack, so it was another reason why the White Horse's offensive was so strong. The White Horse's five forwards advanced in a straight line, making their conservative defense difficult to cope with, which was another good strategy. Therefore, the fact that White Horse controlled the offensive throughout the match was by no means a fluke.</p>
<p>The reason for the Overseas Chinese United's defeat was entirely that they paid too much attention to guarding Han Longhai, and in fact did not pay attention to Han Longhai, which had the possibility of being infiltrated. Once attention was paid, the rest of the generals were able to find gaps. Their forward deployment was to use Artomari as the left winger. According to Artomari, he was originally an inner forward and had the power to return to assist in defense. I don't know why he was moved to the left, which reduced the defensive momentum, which was the biggest mistake in strategy.</p>

<h3>The Volleyball Season Begins: A Discussion of the Serving Rules</h3>
<p>The volleyball season has already arrived, and it seems necessary to discuss the rules. Last year, the Shanghai Volleyball League proceeded smoothly, but unfortunately, the referees had differing opinions on the jumping movement during serving, which led to mutual accusations. According to the explicit provisions of the volleyball rules, there is absolutely no ambiguity. Therefore, this article extracts one or two articles of the rules, hoping that all players will pay attention to them. On the other hand, it is hoped that members of the Volleyball Referee Association will correct them, which would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>The full text of the second example in Article 7 of the Volleyball Rules, Game Rules, states: "When the game begins, the first person in the serving order of the team that serves first shall use one hand (open palm or clenched fist) to serve the ball into the opponent's zone from over the net. When serving, the player's feet shall stand behind the end line (that is, the end line is the furthest point from the net) and the surface is between the extended lines of the two side lines. From the time of preparing to serve until the ball is hit, the foot must not cross the end line. The server may continue to serve until the referee announces "attack failure." At this time, the first person in the serving order of the opposing team will take turns to serve." A note is added below: "If there is not enough open space outside the court and the serving action cannot be carried out, a serving line may be drawn at an appropriate distance in front of the end line." Among them, the phrase "When serving, the player's feet shall stand behind the end line" clearly states: "Both" feet "stand" behind the end line. Lifting one foot and standing with one foot is already inappropriate. Strictly speaking, lifting one foot is already a foul, let alone jumping with both feet! This is one point. Some say that the serve of Mr. Ke Yongzhan, the Far Eastern representative of our country, first retreats a certain distance and then advances to serve. This matter does not contradict the rules. It is permissible to run the entire field before serving. When serving, stand still and strike the ball. If it is forced to be interpreted according to the rules of basketball, it is wrong. Basketball rules cannot be used to explain volleyball rules. Conversely, volleyball rules cannot be used to explain basketball rules. Various ball games have various characteristics and cannot be misinterpreted for each other. This is the second point. Therefore, the jumping movement during serving should be limited. The provisions of the regulations are all designated based on the principle of "equal rights and interests," and there is absolutely no protection for any one party. Furthermore, Article 6 of the Volleyball Rules, the fifth example of the explanation of the naming, states that "violation of the provisions of Article 7, Article 2 is called an error," which proves that the rules have no shortcomings of favoring one party over the other. In order to celebrate his birthday, he launched the Shanghai Team Table Tennis Championship, divided into Group A and Group B, and named it "Lian Qing Cup" to show respect and commemorate him. (Chen Linsheng)</p>
<h3>Linhua Bank Promotes Sports for Bank Employees</h3>
<p>The Linhua Bank authorities, in order to promote amateur sports, held a Linhua Cup mini-ball tournament last year, and the results were very satisfactory. Therefore, this year they continued to hold the second Linhua Cup mini-ball tournament, and will double their efforts to meet the initial intentions. It is reported that this year's tournament will be divided into bank and general groups. For the former, it is natural not to forget its own industry. Looking back at the banking industry, after the Silver Money Friendship Association, there was the Jin Cheng Bank's Tongde Cup basketball tournament, which gave bank employees the opportunity to exercise in their spare time, which was of great significance, but then it became silent. Until last year, Linhua Bank took advantage of the opportunity to rise again, and as a result, various banks formed teams to join, which was very popular for a while. This year, the authorities of the Bank, Liu Zhemian and Qin, saw that the need for proper entertainment for the maritime bank employees was urgent. Therefore, after this football season, small football will be lively, and the second Linhua Cup will be held.</p>
<p>It is decided that the bank group of the Cup will be held first, and it has been scheduled to open on June 3. It is expected that various banks will form teams to join at that time, and there will be a new atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Recent Table Tennis Situation Is Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The Zhonghua Table Tennis Room, run by table tennis players Lu Hanjun and Fang Keping, and the Daxin Table Tennis Room, opened by table tennis comrades Ding Du and Tang Futao, are the most宏great in scale. In a corner of Shanghai, there are the most enthusiasts, and thousands of people go to various table tennis rooms every day to practice and have fun. The enthusiasm is more vigorous than in the past. Recently, various amateur teams are planning to restore their organizations and revive their banners. The reporter will specifically record the most important news in several sections as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Table Tennis Association's work has been suspended for a long time. Recently, the directors Yu Qiqi and Liu Keren have returned to Shanghai from other places. The Association has decided to take on the responsibility of leading and promoting in the past, and has scheduled a full board meeting to be held at the manager's office of the Zhonghua Table Tennis Room on the third floor of the New World at 5:00 PM on Tuesday, the 15th of this month to discuss all routine cases. At that time, I hope that the following directors will attend on time. The full list of directors is as follows: Hu Jiankun, Lu Zhong</p>
<p>Table tennis is the best full-body exercise indoors. Under the enthusiastic promotion of the Shanghai Table Tennis Association, it has become the most common exercise for the public to strengthen their bodies. In the past six months, since Mr. Pan Renxi created the commercial Jinmen Table Tennis Room, it has been very popular among various people. A large number of table tennis rooms have been established in succession. The most popular are table tennis, Liang Jintang, Wang Yi, Zhou Daoyi, Zhou Jiaqi, Ma Runfang, Lu Yingjun, Chen Jimao, Chuan Guixiang, Chen Yi, Yu Qiqi, Liu Keren, Chen Linzhu.</p>
<p>(2) The Shanghai Table Tennis Research Association was initiated and organized by Lu Yingjun, Fang Keping, and Chu Chu, etc., with the aim of improving the level of table tennis, promoting table tennis techniques, and cultivating new talents. It is reported that the Association has accepted the commission of the Heren Table Tennis Association to host the Huiqing Cup Shanghai Team Table Tennis Championship. The competition rules are currently being discussed. It is said that registration will begin on the 14th of this month. The registration office is located at the Zhonghua Table Tennis Room in the New World on Nanjing Road, which is associated with the Association.</p>
<p>(3) The Heren Table Tennis Association was organized by Mao Songting and Wang Ruzhong, and has first-class players Ji Xu Chu, You Qifang, Wang Youxin, Wang Changhou, and Huang Zhijun. The five tigers are strong, and their strength of 69 is unparalleled. The Association, in order to celebrate Yan Huiqing's position</p>
<h3>Essential Principles of Basketball (19)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the above two types of defensive methods each have their own advantages and disadvantages, they each have their own value in application. For example, the main purpose of using the five-man zone defense is to conserve energy and defend against the screen (or pick) offense. However, when using this defensive method, all five players must be able to retreat rapidly at the same time when the team loses possession. Otherwise, if the opponent launches a fast break, it will be impossible to stop their momentum. The biggest weakness of this type of defense is that it cannot pressure the opponent's offense. Therefore, when the opponent has a higher score and adopts a slow-paced offense, or passes the ball among themselves on the perimeter to run out the game clock in order to maintain their scoring lead and secure the victory, you must not stick to this method. You should immediately switch to a man-to-man defense, forcing the opponent to attack, in order to win back possession through their mistakes and launch a counterattack. The main purpose of using "man-to-man" defense is to disrupt the opponent's formation and force them to attack hastily, leaving them no time to catch their breath. However, when using this defensive method, the first priority is that your team's players can appropriately control enemy players based on a real power comparison. Otherwise, if even one person is not able to match the opponent's ability, it will become a weakness, creating a great danger. The biggest shortcoming of this defensive method is that it cannot effectively counter the screen offense, and it is also very energy-consuming. It is not suitable for teams with lower skill levels or older players. Therefore, when encountering an opponent using a screen offense, you must switch to a five-man zone defense, with each person strictly guarding a zone, using the strategy of responding to change with unchanging principles to resist their unpredictable screen plays. When there are four defenders against three attackers, or when the opponent already has three or more defenders, the possibility of a fast break gradually disappears. Therefore, resourceful and skilled teams, after gaining possession of the ball each time, will first look for this kind of opportunity. If a fast break is not possible, then they will consider other tactics.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the fast break is best suited for larger courts and breaking the five-man zone defense. However, those who adopt this tactic, the prerequisite is that the whole team members are more outstanding than the average person, high technical level, familiar with basic movements, sensitive perception, observation and strong judgment, can cooperate and improvise, and overall strategy, can be effective also.</p>
<h3>(B) Positional Offense</h3>
<p>The so-called positional offense refers to attacking after the offensive and defensive lines are formed. There are various names for it: namely the figure-eight offense, diagonal attack, central penetration, sideline infiltration, outside attack with inside response, rotation offense, pivot offense, stalling tactics, etc.</p>
