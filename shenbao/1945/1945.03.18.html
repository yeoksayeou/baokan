<p>中央社訊　中共機關報「解放日報」最近刋載一文，題爲「重慶治下的一月概况」。據該文稱：一月底之重慶所轄各地，煤棉不足，情形日趨嚴重，鋼鐵機械動力五金電氣等重工業，生產依然有減低之勢，且有一部份工廠無法維持，乃將工廠出盤。</p>
<p>工業不振</p>
<p>如紡織業棉花存貨，僅足應付一月，此外各業商店倒閉者日多，且有金融機關數家亦遭厄運，（如重慶永美厚銀行等）致金融方面已發生騷動，凡此種種均爲國民黨大官僚壟斷資本及統制政策失敗有以致之。同時游資趨向，已從黃金美金票等轉向現貨投機，致物責漫漲不已，重慶成都昆明貴陽等各都市，自十二月中旬迄一月底止，已暴漲二倍，而且最近民衆購買力極弱，故物價高漲更促成工商業之危機，人民所愛打擊亦較前更甚。</p>
<p>財政危機</p>
<p>再就財政方面，國民黨埰用「換湯不換藥」的緩和手段，例如取消專賣而改徵專賣利益稅，又各一月至三月徵收，但去年田賦尙有四千萬市石未曾收足，在此種情形下，再以重大負擔（合計糧食二千五百萬市石與金額二百億元）加諸人民，可以想像地方之苦痛。</p>
<p>國民黨當局爲彌補鉅額數字，以一切財政支出分攤於地方，（如靑年軍優待費等）在陝西省達四萬萬元，四川省二十萬萬元，但對分務員敎職員之平價米，並不付給寶物，而以現鈔代替，儘量減少糧食支出。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹</p>
<p>故國民黨之財政仍不得不依靠鈔票印刷機來維持，去年下半期紙幣發行額已達三萬萬元，逆料今後惡性通貨膨脹更將嚴重。於此情勢下，工商各界乃紛紛要求調整公定價格，減輕負擔，取消苛捐雜稅，對統制政策尤表反對。又重慶市商會之出口業各同業公會暨實業界巨頭，要求取消統購統銷，棉紡織業亦抗議綸紗布之統制云。</p>

<h3 id="c13">一個理想 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 周毓英</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>上海的公益慈善機關與寺廟之多，恐怕世界任何都市皆不能與之比擬。單就向社會福利局所登記的而言，公益慈善機關有有二百餘個，寺廟亦有二百餘個，此外不登記的當亦不在少數。這許多機關與寺廟，其中少數徒具空名，自所難免，多數却都是具有相當雄厚的　力的。如果能把這許多資力集合起來，其數字的巨大，恐怕沒有一家大企業或大銀行能够比得上。</p>
<p>中國因爲傳統的道德觀念高上的關係，「救人」常急於「救已」，所以公益慈善事業以至於宗敎的寺廟事業皆極發達，全國各地大致相同，上海因爲是經濟文化的中心地，便比其他各地更，爲發達了。</p>
<p>世界的任何國家或都市，大資本家的意旨常常可以影響政治。上海却不如此，所謂資本家常常躱藏在若干聞人之後，要由聞人去影饗政治，而所謂聞人的構成條件，最重要的便是「樂善好施」四個大字。即使自已沒有錢，能勸人出錢，或用方法呌人家出錢，達到「樂善好施」的目的或形式，這便完成了聞人的要件。聞人哲學惟上海的中國人始能了解，百年來在英美勢力高壓下的上海，只有「急公好義」的總明而勇敢的聞人們才能出來設幾句話，而他們的說話也最有力量，這便形成上海公益慈善以至於宗敎事業之發達了。</p>
<p>上海公益慈善事業的發達，當然大大的減少了貧困市民的痛苦，每年所用於救濟事業的數字，巨大得驚人。雖然因爲種種的困難，政府對於此等事業的管理未便過於嚴緊，許多救濟機關不肯露佈其財政情况，但我們大槪估計一下，則這許多救濟機關都有其各自的行政管理人員·會計司庫以至服務員役，總算起來，恐怕不下二千人，雖不能此整個市政府，却比一個普通的局處要大得多了。其行政費旣如此之大，事業費當然更大了。有如此之大的公益慈善救濟款項用之於貧困的市民，可不　是上海的福星嗎？</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>上海的公益慈善宗敎救濟事業發達到如此地步，上海却並未因此就成爲天堂，種種悲慘的地獄現象仍是隨處可見，乞丐遊民竊賊殘廢無吿的人滿坑滿谷，且經常有總人口十分之二以上的失業人口，這種種湊慘現象，自是歷史積聚而成的危機。我們當然不能說這種現象的存在是過去各種救濟事業的失敗，如果沒有種種色色的救濟事業，上海也許要更糟到不可設想。不過救濟事業的沒有做到充分成功，因而只救到少數人，沒有救得多數人以至於全數的人，却是不可諱言的。</p>
<p>我想上海沒有一個人會對各種救濟事業及其負責人表示不滿，但種種地獄現象的存在，對救濟事業及其負責人懷着更大的期望，却是事實。普通的理想，一個國家之內，乞丐遊民竊賊之洗泆不能普遍地存在，即如有失業現象發生，便急急乎的忙於救濟了，所以日德以至於英美等國，他們對失業救濟便做得非常普遍。可是在中國，失業早成了見怪不怪的平常事情，所謂社會救濟工作，只救那些乞丐遊民竊賊殘廢老弱一類的人便忙得喘不過氣來了。</p>
<p>失業救濟原是社會救濟的根本要著，也是社會救濟的根本辦法。中國過去的社會救濟辦法，收容了若干貧困份子供養他們，錢多的時候給他們吃飯，錢少的時候給他們吃粥，若是「冬賑」，還做棉衣給他們穿，這種辦法，好雖然好，却養成了普遍的依賴性。若能提高救濟的目標，以救濟失業爲中心，不妨礙一般人的「自食其力」的上進精神，在救濟者的負担周然可以減輕，而被救濟者也可以提高了自信心。</p>
<p>百孔千瘡的上海社會，突然要提出失業救濟的話來，無不目爲空想或妄想。失業者如此之多，經濟力量如此薄弱，赤手空拳，眞是從何救起？譬如照一般國家的辦法，由政府通過鉅額預算，對失業市民給付救濟金，這在且前的上海便是根本不可能的事情。再譬如要各種救濟機關來負担救濟失業的責任，那末他們對已經收容了的苦難者就已經感到捉襟見肘，困難萬分，從何再去救濟失業的人呢？但按之實際，失業者的救濟，其緊急的程度形式上或較他種救濟爲後，因爲他們還不至於馬上餓死，馬上就去做竊盜，但實際上他們不過因爲羞恥心，不敢露出乞憐相或其他不道德的行爲。我們試研究一般人的生活經歷，失業階段常常是一個最緊要的關頭，失業的時候對生活絕望，人生最容易墮落的便是這個時期。所謂乞丐遊民等等當初都是有過職業的，不幸曾經一度失業，一時竟沒有方法再獲得職業，於是一旦墮落，黑暗的生存汨沒了上進心，以後再有職業叫他們去做，反而不有做了。所以一個人在失業的時候我們還可以救得起來，萬一等他成了「惰民」，我們要救也救不起來了。目前上海各種救濟機關，救濟孤苦老弱已費盡巨力，還有不少惰民如乞丐遊民竊賊等等則根本無法收拾，站崗警察都只好看看他們，而失業現象的嚴重，此等惰民份子更將逐日增添出來。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>社會有了失業現象不加救濟，勢必日趨墮落，弄得無法收拾。許多進步的國家，他們的公益慈善宗敎等等的救濟事業雖不像中國的發達，但他們對於失業救濟却比中國積極得多，對於生活困苦而一特找不到職業的有失業補助金，政府特設職業介紹所一類的機關供給人民求業和指導就業，不惜爲之每年耗費鉅額金錢。因爲對失業有了救濟，人民使不致因失業而墮落，變成所謂惰民份子，所以對於分益慈善一類的收容救濟機關的需要性也就減少了。</p>
<p>中國因爲對於失業救濟這一點沒有做到，於是一般人失業下來，在痛苦萬狀之中，不少的人竟無可奈何的墮落下去，老弱者洗爲乞丐遊民，强壯者或竟洗爲盜賊土匪，等到社會上產生了惰民層的羣集，以惰民層爲對象而來圖謀救濟，自然難乎其難了。目前的上海，便是大家耗費着巨大的力量去救濟惰民，結果原有的惰民沒有救完，新的惰民却又源源而來了。單看善惰民而去救惰民，成了所謂「揚湯止沸」，若能於救濟惰民之外，更注意到失業救濟，才可以做到「釜底抽薪」，原有的惰民可以逐漸救濟，新的惰民不再產生，那時候上海即使還不能稱爲天堂，但地獄的現象總不至於再擴大蔓延開來了。</p>
<p>上海失業現象的嚴重，任何擁有巨大權力龐大資力的人都不敢輕談救濟，好像一談失業救濟，不是三五家大銀行不够，便是市政府要再加上一倍或數倍的預算。照一般國家的都市通例，失業救濟是都市的重大施政之一，上海的地方政府對這問題向來重視，旣沒有三五家大銀行可以應用於失業救濟，也不能驟然增加數倍的預算使市民不勝負擔，沒有現成的資力，政府又不能提出預算，那未上海的失業問題就長此聽其自然，不謀救濟，地獄現象聽其擴大，更待若干年之後，惰民更將充斥，收容機關警察機關都無法容納無法管理，整個的上海眞要變成地獄了。</p>
<p>上海的失業救濟，是社會救濟的中心工作，也是上海的社會救濟的根本辦法，可是政府沒有預存的錢，提新預算增加市民負擔也不容易，那末絕頂嚴重的失業問題，爲世界各國深切注意的失業救濟，我們竟忽視不顧嗎？我於將行半年的擔任社會福利局的職務之後，從經騐上得到一個非常深刻的感想。就是上海的救濟事業雖然非當發達，非常衆多，可是似乎都是消極的，甚至是浪費的，—我說出這樣的話眞是對不起那許多熱心公益慈善東善好施的先生們，人家爲救濟貧苦，日夜辛勤，力竭聲嘶，我還在這裏說風凉話，簡直太殘酷了。不過疏忽失業羣的救濟，專事於惰民羣的救濟，在救濟的效果上說，終究是消極的，不是積極的；再說那種「爲佈施而佈施」，只重「功德」不注意效果，也是不敢恭維的。</p>
<p>上海要着手失業救濟，需要鉅大的資金，政府沒有現存的錢，又不能捉新預算增稅，但社會方面却有　大的現成的資金，即是各種公益慈善宗敎等等的救濟事業，他們不學每年有鉅額的捐款收入，並且大都有龐大的固定財產，這種龐大的固定財產和經常的捐款收入，如能集合起來而加以整理　營，一方面維持固有的救濟事業，更顧及急切的失業救濟，那末嚴重的失業救濟問題便可以開始着手了。失業救濟問題只要開始能够着手，能够引起多數人的注意，將來要想市政府方面提新預算或籌臨時經費，也是極可能的事情。當社會下注意失業問題，失業救濟問題本身又是亂絲一團無從着手，當然政府非但不能接受，事實上也沒有人能够具體的提出來。</p>
<p>上海失業救濟，不能像外國的發給失業補助金和設立職業介紹所便能解決。因爲發給失業補助金，政府還無此財力，設立職業介紹所，根本沒有什麽生產企業需要用人，所以這種救濟方法前者是沒有人敢想，後者則即使辦了也不見功效。失業詠象存在的最大原因由於生產低落，所以解決失業還是要注意發展生產，而發展生產又是需要資本的，這又使我想到上海固有的各種救事濟業的基礎，這種固有的基礎如能加以實在的發民，注意及於生產事業的開發或帮助原有生產事業的改進，一方面各種救濟事業的財產不至慢性凍結或留藏於所謂善棍之手，同時每一生產事業的開發改進必吸收相當的失業人口，這是從根本上救起貧困者的苦難，若從宗敎的說法，　是莫大的「功德」。少數所謂善棍想把特救濟事業的財產，常以保護公產爲擋前牌拒絕一切改進的辦法，並拒絕一切社會人士以及政府方面的查問，其實只要澈底實行財政公開，公共性質的財產決不能爲任何私人所搬走的。否則高喊「保護公產」的善棍們，他們只知把公產凍結在自己的名下，却不肯把他所管理下的事業的整個財政狀况公佈於社會，名義上保護過密，實際上早已有名無實了。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>現在　將我心目中的「一個理想」，扼要的叙述於下。目爲中國社會救濟的一個新意見也好，目爲中國失業救濟的一個小</p>
<p>小的提議也好，希望社會人士能加以密切的注意，如能不客氣的加以指敎批評，更是萬分歡迎的</p>
<p>一，凡在本市居住之市民，除衰老殘廢或尙在敎育時期中，均應有固定職業。無職業之市民或失業之市民，應向政府指定之處所登記求　。其不願就業或暫時無相當職業之居民，政府得徵用其勞力或加以重捐。</p>
<p>二，凡本市一切公益慈善宗敎團體有社會救濟之宗旨並有固定財產者，均應負擔失業救濟之責任，即均應在其可能範圍內舉辦生產事業，吸收失業份子。必要時得聯合各該國體成立失業救濟委員會，羣策羣力，共同努力失業救濟之事業</p>
<p>三，本市內不論任何公益慈善宗敎團體，其所有產業不許無形凍結或擱淺，應公開徵求硏究如何運用於生產的方法，旣爲團體本身增加收益，復爲社會失業減少恐慌。其仍有隱匿而凍結擱淺者，市民得予以檢舉控告，政府當對負責人嚴予處罰。</p>
<p>四，各公益慈善宗敎團體，得就其性質與範圍之所近，舉辦生產事業，吸收失業份子。例如同鄕會及各地公所會館得就其故鄕之土產運滬加工製銷，並吸收其同鄕之失業者；寺廟敎會得就其近使之點創立生產事業，並吸收其僧道敎友中之失業者；各業公所公會，得就其本業創立生產事業或新試騐事業，並　吸收其本行中之失業者。</p>
<p>五，各公益慈善宗敎團體所辦理之生產事業，應以社會救濟減少失業爲目的，不以圖利爲目的，故其事業即使虧損，祗須非由於舞弊中飽或經理者之過失，皆可以新收捐款補足之。但其事業之經營狀况，須有定期之公開報告，並向政府備案。</p>
<p>六，市政府對各公益慈善宗敎團體所辦理之生產事業，應特予保護，並密切注意，必要時　借流動資金或予以特別補助金。</p>
<p>七，市政府經常辦理專門人才登記，職業介紹，職業指導，籌備對失業者予以補助金，必要時舉辦重大工事如築路濬河開　等以代賑濟。適當之生產事業。公共企業，政府亦可籌資辦理。政府爲求失業救濟之推進，不妨增加預算，或臨時發行公債庫券。蓋對失業羣之救濟，乃爲澈底的積極的救濟，而對惰民羣之救濟，乃爲姑惜的消極的救濟，前者爲根本救濟，後者則捨本逐末也。</p>

<p>圈定土地改爲商用</p>
<p>（一）（問）本市在事變後，各處曾有用盟邦海軍各義圈定之土地頗多，此項土地旋即改爲商用，地國上設有竹行或木材　料行等，但業主數年來未能享受任何權利，或將該地收回自用，若諮詢各該竹木行主人（華籍）時，均被　理拒絕，請問貴局對於上項業主之權益，能否予以相當之保障？（中華日報社問）</p>
<p>（答）本市在事變後，盟邦海軍如須　用土地，均由盟邦函知市府後，令飭通知業主辦理徵租手續，　　用後之如何用途，本局無從知悉，如原業主之地查明確有被普通商行佔用者，如向本局聲請，　當代向有關當局詢明後，予以辦理，俾得粗常保障。</p>

<p>申請登記手續緩慢</p>
<p>（三）（問）地政局辦理各項申請登記手續緩慢，其原因何在？（中央社問）</p>
<p>（答）本局辦理各項登記，關於轉移抵押，如證據確實，手續完備者，均隨到隨辦，於當日辦結，並不緩慢，惟查有舊案如產權曾有爭執及經涉訟法院等，均須詳查卷宗圖册，自須稍　時日，然人氏往往有證據手續欠缺，或因住址不明，通知無法滬投，因此延擱，此實人民自誤。</p>

<h3 id="c35">重點配給在南京 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>物資配給制度，戰時各國都已採用，早被認爲在物資困難中解決民生問題的最優良的制度了。如果能够統盤　劃，辦理完密，使每一個人得到合理的消費，對節約物資，增强戰力，關係甚大。京市的配給制度，在兩年前已開始，最近文有重點配給的改革，重點配給在我國先後實行着的，祗有京滬兩地。</p>
<p>。。配給重點的分別。。</p>
<p>南京　辦理配給物資的機關，起初是市經濟局，後來該局奉令撤銷，就在市政府內成立了一個「南京特別市物資配給委員會」，以市長爲主任委員，有關的長官爲委員，受着市政　的直接管轄，辦理配政。</p>
<p>在未實行重點配給以前的配給對象着重在一般民衆，以區公所的戶口册爲標準，大約有七十萬人，憑證配發，同時公務員兵警及學校報社文化團體，也都有享受配給的權利，但是這種配給，附屬於市民配給。</p>
<p>爲了强化配政，增强效果起見，去年底由配給當局計劃改變爲重點配給制，於是主要對象，從市民轉向到公務員兵警與文化人上，這些人的配給數量，要較一般市民所得者爲多，現在全市享受重點配給的，約有十萬人，約占全市人口百分之十五，其中尤以新聞記者和學校敎職員享受較厚，因爲這等人比較淸苦的關係。</p>
<p>。。已配物資的種類。。</p>
<p>配給物資，現在僅限於糖·鹽·捲烟·麵粉等項。米的配給，因爲國府實行俸米制以後公務員已有享受，市民配給，在改了重點配給以後無形停止了。現在所有的僅限於各機關政務官官邸的食米配給和各學校敎職員的廉價配給了，每石配給價二月份不過八千元，</p>
<p>糖的配給　每人一斤，有時半斤，目前收配價每斤九百元，配給日期不確定。麵粉配給次數很少，最近一次數量較多，最高配給量，每人達半袋之多，每袋收價四千元。其中配給得次數最多的，要算捲烟了，戴止目前爲止，已配發到二十九期，差不多至少每月有一次，每次每人十包，以中級烟居多數。其他像肥皂火柴等類的日用品配給很希有，似乎也和米的配給一樣，偏重於政府的高級官吏，就像去年底的一次肥皂配給，特任官各配一箱，簡任官各配十二塊，薦任官和委任官各配一塊。還有冬季煤的配給，但祗限於特任和簡任官。</p>
<p>。。優待淸寒文化人。。</p>
<p>此外尙可一述的，還有最近對淸寒文化人特別優待的特種配給。</p>
<p>淸寒文化人，顧名思義，當然是祗限於文化人中生活淸苦的一部份，凡對於文學，戲劇，詩歌，美術在著作上有相當聲譽，而生活相當淸苦的人，或經常撰稿，以　文爲生，而由報館或雜誌當局證明的，也可享受這項特權。</p>
<p>現在京市全市的淸寒文化人雖然還沒有統計過，決不在少數，經審查而合格的，已有吳觀　等六十六人。已經配給過的物資，有麵粉和捲烟兩種，所收的配給價，也和一般的相同，尙在計劃中的，有肥皂，糖，火柴，煤炭等項食用主要物品。在京市實施重點配給中而有淸寒文化人特種配給之舉，未始不是一　可稱道的事。</p>

<h3 id="c36">呂宋島上　日肉搏衝鋒隊　以血肉築成之長城抗禦美軍油鐵洪流 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>敵芙侵寇呂宋島以來，迄今已一月半，戰綫自仁牙因　至馬尼刺，綿延二百五十公里。敵軍且更於那斯克布·斯必克兩　及巴打半島·老列基陀島以生力軍登陸。按美軍用於呂宋的兵力，已達十二個師團廿萬人。然在每日累計千餘架的美空軍的絕對制空下，日本陸海將士却壯志凌雲，大顯神威，日夜衝鋒肉搏，卒使美軍大量流血，自上陸迄今，美軍損失已達七萬。於敵軍壓倒的物量攻擎下，克服一切惡劣條件，毅然奮戰的菲島日軍，其勇敢的行爲，實係日軍必勝信念所造成的。茲將過去呂宋日軍血戰事蹟，摭拾一二，以　讀者。</p>
<p>忘我精神</p>
<p>此次呂宋島作戰中，値得持筆大書的是盡忠報國的肉搏衝鋒隊。如果認「雷伊泰島作戰之花是特攻隊」，則呂宋島戰事的精華當爲肉搏衝鋒隊。特攻隊係將士組成，肉搏衝鋒隊則不分士兵隊長，是由地上部隊全體構成，此點尤爲特色。嘗見某部隊本部僅有部隊長及幕僚而無傳令兵，　問其故，某部隊長昻然答道：「全部出去衝鋒了。以後就輪到我們啦！」地上部隊使這　全體揮着寶刀懷着炸彈衝進了敵陣。美軍白　在飛機·戰事及大砲的掩護下企圖挺進，但夜間却是日軍肉搏隊的世辦。阿茲·塞班·迭尼安那種鬼哭神嚎的壯烈肉搏，今日正在呂宋各地不絕演出。這座肉搏衝鋒隊，少則三人，隨時隨地伺機攪亂敵陣，建立赫赫戰勳而返，苟有良機，再行殺入，多則全體衝鋒，務使美軍大量流血。說是壯烈，誠是不虛。</p>
<p>因此，雖然極想一個一個　寫這些肉搏隊的勇士，可是當你拉住其中一個求他告訴姓名時，這些甘作無名英雄的勇士却回答：「肉搏隊不只我們幾個。你還是講些與敵艦偕亡的特攻隊的軼事給我們聽吧。」此種忘我的偉大胸襟，實在叫人感激涕零。每逢黑夜，呂宋島各地就成爲這批勇士活躍的舞台，對依憑物質的美軍展開劇然的夜戰。</p>
<p>美軍浪費</p>
<p>憑藉汽油，鋼鐵及數量從事戰鬥的美軍戰術思想，在此次呂宋作戰中已發揮到近於頂點。日軍特攻隊雖然一再猛轟，美軍在上陸前十日　仍於仁加因　集結百五十艘至二百艘的大小船舶，連日以累計數百架的艦載機·陸上機猛烈轟炸，並作艦砲射擊，摧毀仁加因　沿岸一帶所有障碍物，然後實行上陸。抵岸以後，仍保持一貫作風，不惜用二百公斤的炸彈轟炸一間小屋一個活人。美軍的步兵，　無此種鋼鐵洪水的掩護，從不進前一尺。日軍某一小隊所守的陣地，曾在一大之內從正面受到二千發的槍砲彈。美軍甚至對於一個日兵也不惜浪　數十發的砲彈。又如馬尼刺日　守備隊在二公里的防區內曾一日受到萬餘發砲彈的集中射擊，同時且有敵機的猛炸。自呂宋作戰開始後，美軍即於兩個星期以內使用仁加因·聖法比安·達莫蒂斯等飛行塲，與雷伊泰·明多羅的基地航空兵力協力，連日以B24，B25，P38，P30，P51及PBY，A20A等型飛機，不斷騷擾呂宋各地，謀以累計千餘架的飛機控制天空，但呂宋島上的日軍將士却在此種物　重壓下，毅然抵抗，使美軍大量流血。</p>
<p>黑夜奇襲</p>
<p>美軍如在白晝藉飛機，戰車，彈幕的掩護而挺進，日軍即於黑夜的衝鋒肉搏，蹂躪敵陣。僅僅三五個日兵的行動，即可瞬刻傾覆白天不斷咆哮的美軍重砲陣地，一舉粉碎美軍的戰事羣，建立美軍雖用數百發槍砲彈，數十架飛機而不能獲得的戰果。因此，美軍縱有每日累計千架的飛機掩護，而於一個半月的呂宋作戰中仍有七萬餘的死傷。由此足證油鐵的洪水實難冲毀日軍血肉構成的長堤。</p>
<p>戰局形勢</p>
<p>自雷伊泰島作戰至呂宋島作戰，戰局的旋渦已自南移北而在仁牙因　上陸轉向馬尼刺及其周圍的戰鬥時，美方的宣傳又在呼號中國大陸作戰或侵入日本本土，然而呂宋戰事現方逐漸自前哨戰進入大決戰。</p>
<p>美軍登陸呂宋島以來，一部侵入馬尼刺，其餘則　橫斷巴打半島北部，並自那斯克布北上，更在巴打半島考列基陀島上陸，以議强行突入馬尼刺灣。另一方面，一部分美軍同時逐漸浸潤　拉那特中央呂宋山脈南　的聖　　，比沙爾，島　　方面。據美方宣傳，日軍業已截成四段，但是否確實呢？仔細檢討其佈置，則麥克沃塞軍僅賴飛機戰車的掩護而取得中部呂宋平原沿公路的狹長地帶而已。美軍集於比方面的兵力，凡十五師團，其中已有兩三師團在仁牙因　周圍的戰鬥及向南推進途中潰不成軍。而那斯克布，斯比克　的登陸戰亦遲遲不　，仁牙因　登陸的美軍，亦漸在克拉克費爾特，比沙爾，鳥明岡，摩尼奧斯及馬尼刺等方面遭受日軍猛擎，業已損失七萬餘人。換言之，巧妙利用呂宋島的山岳及地形而布下　陣的日軍精銳，散布美軍的背後及側面，苟有積極攻擊的良機·即一舉切斷仁牙因至馬尼刺的美軍連絡，加以包　，而其他各地的美軍亦有遭受各個擊破的危險。</p>
<p>美軍在戰略上所有的優勢，郎爲超過千架的航空兵力及驅使百萬噸以上船舶的補給力。要之，即憑藉數量從事戰鬥而已。與如此的敵軍作戰，自非易事。唯日軍咸抱必勝信念，辭以血肉彌補鋼鐵欠足的缺憾。今日，呂宋島上的日軍正在貫徹這種精神，盡可能打擊美軍，使之大量流血。（松崎報道　員·譯自二月二十八日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3 id="c39">上海的保甲工作 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 顧繼武</p>
<p>本市近年以來，因環境之變遷，社會動　，治安　定，保甲組織即適應新情勢而產生。但在個人主義與英美思想交織而成的國際都市，推行有組織有紀律的保申制度，我們終覺得是一件很艱鉅的工作。</p>
<p>在「守望相助」的原則下，初期的保甲工作已經發揮了它的效能，上海特殊環境中的暗殺盜劫以及一切破壞性的恐怖行動，都逐漸的消滅了，然而在整個保甲行政上，因爲法令規章的紛歧，事權的不統一，還是不能澈底，使市民盲無適從。</p>
<p>租界收回以後，上海市政宣告劃期的統一，當局深感在大上海建設上，確保治安上，保甲工作更應負起重大的責任，於是合悱了前公共租界，舊法租界，及滬西越界築路部份的各制保甲機構，同時爲積極實行警保聯繫，在警察局設立保甲處、專司其事而加以强化。</p>
<p>保甲處成立之初，因歷來本市保甲機構之各自爲政，經費收支並無確定，而人事上亦復良莠不齊，故展開整理工作之際，頗感棘手。幸當局及各方的誠意協力，各項設施，得以逐步展開。</p>
<p>保甲祖織着手整理後，舊公共租界及法公　局之保甲委員會，及公共租界警察署之保甲指導委員會，遂合併另組爲上海特別市警察局市區保甲委員會，以警局有關人員各總聯保長地方士紳名流爲委員，下設區委員會，成爲各級保甲的　詢機關，使政令迅速推行，民情得以上達，而在保甲的事權上亦趨向統一之途。</p>
<p>上海自開埠百年以來，從未有正確之戶口統計，而一般市民更如一盤散沙，有向　一屋而老死不相往來的，充滿「各人自掃門前雪」的孤鵝思想。在保甲創立後、第一步便實行淸查戶口，使　小奸徒及一切不良份子無從置跡，而市民亦恢復了相政相賙守望相助的古道德，這不能不說是保甲工作上小小的功績。</p>
<p>保甲最大的任務是組織民衆，訓導民衆，所以上海的自　團充分發揮了這點，　　踐了保甲傳統的美德，一面自警自衛，一面協助軍警消弭盜賊及一切犯罪行　、最近經積極的訓練編組，自警團團本部亦告成立，出警局周兼局長任團長關係處長担任團本部的指揮督導工作，幾與警局打成一片，同時過去自警團員有因公而殉職者，以及奮勇捕盜獲獎的，這一點我們可以自慰而更要自勉的。</p>
<p>關於保甲經費的收支，最容易引起市民的疑慮。因爲保甲經費各區以不同的方式隨意徵收或向商號捐募，或依房租爲比例附從，各自爲政，同時難免有不良份子從中魚肉良民，故保甲處特訂定經費統一徵收辦法，以所得百分之八十作爲各區保甲經費，百分之二十作爲全體性的設施之用，實行「取之於民用之於民」，並澈底的公開，故今後利用保甲名義而斂財的情事，或可杜絕。</p>
<p>保甲人員之良　不齊，爲不可諱言亦不必諱言之事實，且因警察局制度法令之關係，每使上民遷出遷入戶口異動以及居住證之申請自警團之服役等，均時有遷受要挾留難，當局苦於耳目不週，證佐不足，無從着手。我們願市民諒解並協力檢舉，同時務使保甲人員實行自肅。</p>
<p>保甲組織誠然是政府與人民間的橋樑，保甲人員負起了協力治安監督檢舉社會一切罪行的　任，所以對於保甲同志們埋頭苦幹的精神，我們是深表欽佩的，目前因爲生活程度的高漲，保甲處已向當局提出將保甲專職工作人員列入重點配給內，已　當局予以考慮，不久當可圓滿答覆，在保申本位努力的同志們，可以安心工作。</p>
<p>時局已趨緊迫，我們的工作亦隨着急　的開展，在防空上警務上，保申同志繼了最大的責任，最近我們更將利用保甲力量，協助本市的疏散人口工作在市民歸鄕時，在其移動說上加蓋「疏散歸鄕」之標識，以杜絕流弊，同時絕對嚴禁對中請移動時有任何留難並講求　實有效之辦法，以期疏散工作順利進行。</p>
<p>過去陳前市長時常訓勉我們除自治自衛外要自　自强，建設優良的制度，組織民衆，訓練民衆，使他們有團結，有紀律，把愛地方的觀念，擴大爲愛國愛東亞的觀念，現在周兼市長與羅秘書長對保甲工作更非常重視，要我們保甲同志，協助政府，監督檢舉社會的不良份子，以鞏固治安，所以今後的責任是更感重大了。</p>
<p>市區保甲委員會，爲使保甲行政的一元化及充實機構起見，最近敦請羅秘書長担任委員長，以便指導　率，同時保甲宣傳委員會，亦與新聞協會上海分會當局取得連絡，將告成立，與衛生委員會交通委員會相互協力，共同來推行保甲建設工作。</p>
<p>我們站在保甲工作第一線的同志，雖經幾年來的理頭工作，但是目前，上海的保甲仍未能如理想的完善。不過我們有着自信，不計成敗與毀譽，但間耕耘不問收獲的去苦幹，在周市長羅秘書長的領導下，開關我們的新天地。但是在目前的大時代中，還希望社會人士以風雨同舟的情感，來協力我們共問邁進。</p>
<h3 id="c40">疏散與鐵道 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 孟惠榮</p>
<p>近來上海正在進行疏散人口；但是多數民衆，還是遲遲不行，究其因，不得不歸諸於交通不便。就以單人　　而言，購票軋車便要費半條性命，路上黃制服黑帽子還要呼么喝六。空身者如此，假如扶老携幼，帶些行李的人，只能望而却步。因此多數人抱着「　　眼甫便吃苦頭，不如挨一日算一日」。就例人經歷而言，乘火車的確有二個困難。</p>
<p>購車票是第一難：現在火車減少，票額有限；　白市票須得挨軋一　，能購得與否，絕無把　。若令歸女老幼去軋凍　　，殊成問題。又票子限本身親購，老人小孩却都無居住證。若買黑市票，出了高價不算，無熟人難買到，一家全買不能買齊，日子難確定，買着了又怕敲詐，要回鄕，購票一個難關便難打破。</p>
<p>帶行李是第二難：疏散救災鄕的人，最少總要帶着一年四季的　着和一些不可缺的東西。這等東西當然非打行李不可。可是近來火車站行李房，時常停寄箱　舖蓋。打電話去詢問，說可以寄，但等行運到，臨時就說停寄。每天像這樣枉費車錢的人，　不知多少。不帶　　舖蓋，便不能回鄕；已費九牛二虎之力購着車票的人，結果還是爲了行李中途退回。</p>
<p>就說幸而寄通了行李；到目的地後又生問題，出小費不算，還要時常短缺幾件。新近有個從上海乘火車到蚌埠去的朋友，因行李遺失，進退兩難。來信說：「……往車站去拿行李，打開一看，東西少去大半，人地生疏，交涉無從」。黑帽子要錢，紅帽子要東西，坐火車有這許多障礙，要疏散非請交通機關改善現狀不可。</p>
<p>疏散聲中學校應取辦法　陸錫琛</p>
<p>疏散人口今日至爲必要，然學生往往因遷居中途放棄學業，對其學業影響頗大，所以我以爲學校當局應速採取下列辦法，以適合環境的需要，補救這個缺憾。（一）在疏散以前這學期不放假（星期目及其他一切假期停止）繼續授課。（二）學期結束至少在四月底，爲配合疏散工作，尙望賢達之敎育家商議出一良好的辦法。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 以</p>
<p>現在的紅色汽車，在本市交通工具上佔極重要的地位。每一個站上都排着一大批的人，要上車，至少須等半小時。在公司當局。當然也盡了最大的力量來維持，再要請求增加車輛，事實上恐難辦到。筆者有一個方法，間接使車子加大，多載乘客：這就是　求公司把車中的座位全部拆除，這樣至少可多載三分之一的乘客，換名話說，使乘車的人每人每次省下十餘分鐘等車的時間。</p>
<p>在車中裝座位的本意是使乘客舒適，但現在反變了後上　者的累贅；背後腰軋在座位橫把手上，前面有人在拚命的擠，使人又酸又痛，這是多數在中站上車者的經騐。</p>

<p>— 耶瑪</p>
<p>我爲一輻色彩明亮的海島油畫所迷惑住了。</p>
<p>「你愛海麽？」</p>
<p>「是的，當我想起海島的時候。」</p>
<p>「海島？」</p>
<p>「長春的島嶼，在大海的彼端。」</p>
<p>「這麽說你愛海島是深切過愛海了。」</p>
<p>「有人愛海，因爲風暴來時的海嘯；有人愛海，因爲海的　色，與海空的明亮；有人愛海，因爲海灘邊旁的貝殼。有個詩人說：「我的耳朶是貝殼，愛聽大海的聲音。」而我，則是因爲海外有長春的</p>
<p>「這輻油畫中的海島……」</p>
<p>「不錯，這正是我夢中所見的海島的景象，你瞧，除了白色的雲朶，藍色的海與天，赤赭色的海灘旁的岩石以外，這島下便只有單純的濃郁的綠色了。」</p>
<p>「綠色是生命的顏色。」</p>
<p>「然而，光是綠色是不够表現生命的，單純的綠色，有時也有其特殊的悲切感。假如說它能表現生命，表現靑春，則還是由於其他色澤配襯的緣故。你不見到，假如沒有雲朶，海·天·巖右，這幅畫的色彩便不會如此明亮麼！」</p>
<p>「你是愛上這油畫的色彩！」</p>
<p>「不，色彩只能作爲表現的手段。唯有油畫中的海島底實地的景象的幻想，才是我所渴望的。你可曾聽見過？一個少年航海而去，數年不歸的故事？有人笑他是傻子，因爲他此去沒有目標，然而沒有目標正是目標，航海而去的少年永不爲世人所能了解。他此去爲了找尋一個長春的島嶼，常錄的天地。」</p>
<p>「他找到了沒有？」</p>
<p>「誰知道？反正他一去不歸，一年以後尙有痴心的姑娘背地裏哭着想念他；五年後尙有人指着他底　封的屋子談起他；十年以後，人們都忙於生活，在勞碌之餘漸漸把他淡忘了。二十年三十年……那少年已在人們的印象中完全消失。」</p>
<p>「於是這少年此後便沒有音訊？」</p>
<p>「是的，那少年永遠不再出現了。直到一個數不淸年數和日子以後，有一艘破船敗的小舟從海外漂泊歸來，船在海灘邊靠了岸，一個遍頭白髮的老人走上岸時，他以睜着迷糊的眼，露出驚奇。許多孩子們都圍着看他，看他這個奇異的人。他走到昔日少年的故居，如今屋已敗坍做了墳塲，他詢問一二個村人的姓名，小孩們都自認那是他們的死去多年的祖父和祖母。」</p>
<p>「這個老人是誰呢？」</p>
<p>「這倆老人是誰呢？沒有一個孩子沒有一個少年能够知道。直待有一個瘋癱的老人聽孩子們傍晚歸來說起那個奇異的老人那，才知道就是許多年前航海而去的少年。」</p>
<p>「他找到長春的海島了？」</p>
<p>「他找到長春的海島了？誰和道呢？總之沒有人知道這些了。」</p>
<p>「那末你的故事……？」</p>
<p>「是的，我的故事在這裏兒結了。那老人在當天薄暮又不見了，只留下那殘破的小舟在岸邊。」</p>
<p>一個間歇，我聽得一聲輕輕的嘆息。</p>

<p>— 藍羽</p>
<p>望春花的故事</p>
<p>你可曾聽說過望春花的故事？望春花開放在春天沒來的時節。到了春天，它却悄悄地枯萎了。　自己底殘紅伴着春光。</p>
<p>1.春訊</p>
<p>推開　子，小天井上有一塊蔚藍的天。</p>
<p>有風緩緩地吹來，吹來了異樣的感覺。</p>
<p>算時候，原也該是春天了。</p>
<p>我曾度過了不少的冬天。在一些悠綿的寒凍的日子，我蜷縮在陰暗的古屋里，聽着窓外北風搖撼着枯禿的梧桐。望着灰色的天空上的疾飛的小鳥，常她不自禁地　起了一些警惕，一些戰慄。</p>
<p>「我可是已經僵化了？」我驚慌地問自己。</p>
<p>可是靈魂睡眠了，沒有回答，只有北風搖着窓子，打起　銳的胡哨……</p>
<p>然而，我終於　到了春天。</p>
<p>蔚藍的天上有隻鴿子飛來，那該是一個使者，帶給了人間一些春訊。</p>
<p>「我也要做個使者。」我向鴿子說。</p>
<p>我將春訊告訴了蚯蚓；告訴了垂楊；告訴了靑山綠水。歸來，我辛苦地做了一個夢。</p>
<p>夢里，有杜鵑花開遍的春山，有黃鶯鳥鳴徹的柳堤；濛濛的春雨里，有個騎在牛背上披　次　的牧童，而茫然間自己就是那牧童了，雖然我原不會吹　，也不曾　過牛。</p>
<p>醒來時，還在斗室里，窓外雖也不知什麼時候起已下了雨，然而，這兒沒有花香，沒有鳥語，　在窓口的仍是隣家的灰墻，淋了雨，顯得深一塊淡一塊的。</p>
<p>這原只是一塲夢。春夜的夢常是荒唐的。我底想像走得太遠了。</p>
<p>這不是夢想；這是渴望。</p>
<p>是春訊引起的渴望。</p>
<p>2.靑芽</p>
<p>天井裏的石板　　，　出了一條條的泥土，這幾天來，漸漸地有些靑靑的苗　生長了。</p>
<p>是誰橋下的　？——我該感謝播種的人。是他爲我底小天井裏　來了春天·地方雖小，誰說這不就是這灰　的世界裏的一綫生機？</p>
<p>有誰知道它是什麼時候生長，怎麼生長的；是飛鳥丟下的？還是螞蟻的成績？整整一個冬天，我沒看見一絲些　　　，泥上凍着，冰冷地。</p>
<p>我歡呼，我跳躍，我在自己底小開井裏找到了春天。</p>
<p>我渴望着能再發現第二堆靑芽。</p>
<p>於是我細心地，渴望地，找遍了每一條蚯蚓似的泥上。</p>
<p>可是，沒有。</p>
<p>失望麼？不，一點也不失望。</p>
<p>我只是　　於自己的沒有力氣，不然的話，我將搬起了一塊塊的石板，在那底下，我相信我會找到更多的春色！</p>
<p>而天幷終於也有些綠意了。</p>
<p>我愛這些可愛的小生命，我爲它們洒了水。</p>
<p>一隻不知名的小鳥飛過墻來，啾了一聲。</p>
<p>是說那堆靑靑的苗芽，不久將開花了吧？</p>
<p>3.燕子</p>
<p>「燕子歸來　　壘。」</p>
<p>東風早就吹起，請燕子回來築巢吧！</p>
<p>可是，到如今，我沒有看見當年的燕子有一隻歸來。</p>
<p>年年，常雜兩隻紫裳的燕子，在　前　泥啄草，爲我陪伴着春天。</p>
<p>春紫燕雙飛，我階前獨立，也曾消磨了不少的春日。……</p>
<p>可是，在一個蕭蕭的秋日裏，燕子翩翩地飛去了。</p>
<p>從此，沒有消息，也不再看見它們回來。</p>
<p>主人耐心地等着，等着，終不曾看見那一雙熟悉的影子掠過遼闊的天際。</p>
<p>我懷念着，不安地懷念着。</p>
<p>我要問　　，問飛鳥，問東風，飄過陌上的時候，可曾看見了我底燕子？</p>
<p>我要找　，我要呼喚，向着天邊，海角。</p>
<p>4.枯枝</p>
<p>枯枝曾在秋天里落盡了它的黃葉。</p>
<p>在北風的胡哨里，幾次地曾　動了亭亭的軀幹，可是，幾次地又直立了。</p>
<p>直立着，直立着，將修長的手臂伸在灰黯的天空里。</p>
<p>黃葉落滿了荒園，荒園是冷落的。枯枝也是寂寞的。</p>
<p>在寂寞里又度過了一個冬天。</p>
<p>如今，枯枝上有新的　葉長出了。</p>
<p>新的嫩葉，長出在枯禿的枝幹上，嫩嫩的，綠綠的，在春天的太陽下笑着。</p>
<p>望着自己的孩子們生長在自己的傷痕上，枯枝就難道沒有一絲喜悅？</p>
<p>它沒有白等。</p>
<p>你說荒園依舊是冷落的麼？野草很快會茁長起來的。「春風吹又生」，春風不早就吹着了麼！</p>
<p>明天這兒，枯枝底下，會有帶着紙　來的孩子們底脚步的。……</p>
<p>5尾聲</p>
<p>東風夾着些野花香緩緩地吹來，我聞到了泥土的氣息。</p>
<p>我沒有忘記　　的話：</p>
<p>「假使冬天已經來到，春天　會　　嗎？」</p>
<p>是的，春天原不是遙遠的。</p>
<p>我也聽到了　個夢想家方　生的　　：</p>
<p>「你看！外面是太陽，是春天。」……</p>

<h3 id="c46">市長杯足球半决賽　評述東華僑聯大戰 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>第二屆市長杯半決賽東華逢僑聯，於昨日下午三時半在逸園球塲舉行。日昨春風和煦，氣候宜人，以故咸陽路頭，萬千球迷，傾巷以來，誠爲本季足球賽中最合理想者。</p>
<p>回溯市長杯之舉辦，上季爲第一屆，醫決賽權者，即爲日昨會仗之東僑兩軍，東華以六對一大勝榮　錦標，此景此情，猶在目前。唯本屆東華因稍見洩氣，僑聯則大見整飭，職是之故，更覺耐人尋味，無怪有此盛况也。</p>
<p>破釜沉舟各抱雄心</p>
<p>賽前與程伯庵葉伯華徐志　諸君晤談，彼等均係各該隊有關係者。一謂東華今日必勝，蓋本季初，東華確以疏於練習致現不濟，而最近以天氣及塲地之適宜，頻多操練機會。　氣一足，情形自見良好，則以東華將士之經騐老練，臨陣能隨機應變，對付敵隊弱處。况本季恢復令譽，亦端賴此市長盃而己，必勝之雄心，由斯而起。一謂僑聯成軍以來，威名雖播，但迄未染指任何錦標，木屆旣有最理想之陣綫，而報效主人之恩，此其時矣，况兩隊本屆在聯賽中均受挫折，無復問津之途，故東華有自信克制僑聯之能力。僑聯亦認爲本屆之東華可欺，俱認對手爲俎上之肉，多抱雄心，準備勝此一役，而與滬警決戰，又有穩取荊州之司能。細聆所述理由，各具卓見，此役過程之緊　，筆者早於此間想像及矣。果也，兩軍各盡其努力之本份，絕鮮差池，法定時間，各無所獲照章延長，依然兩無所得，　是難解難分之一塲好廝殺球戰。茲略記昨戰精彩之處，評述其作戰之成功，及失敗焦點。</p>
<p>精彩鏡頭驚險百比</p>
<p>東華先賴　風之助，攻勢極見銳利，十分鐘內右翼小將陳明哲兩失竄進可中之球，實基於膽怯，閱歷不足耳。二十分鐘時，明哲底角勾中一球恰到好處，孫錦順適逢其會，在門前僅十碼左右，阻攔無人，阿孫竟爾遲疑不決，終成泡影，以阿孫之經騐及脚頭之爽快而言，萬不應有此失着。有謂其初不料明哲有此佳妙之一勾，以致球突如其來，未及準備所致，此說有理，然失去此絕好機會，在塲觀衆，莫不頓足嘆息。三十分鐘時，僑聯力圖進攻，巴瑪有一最佳之塞空檔球。鮑傑與亞托馬利，雙驕並進，竟爲張邦綸奮勇從二人中躍起接住，允爲傑作。嗣後兩軍均努力於防守，雖護復亦緊趨對手。張林很與巴瑪之間，小起誤會，幸即平息。上半時東華在順風攻勢旺盛中，終未有所獲，〇對〇結束。</p>
<p>延長時間難解難分</p>
<p>下半時，僑聯久靜思動，益以風助，果見攻勢不弱。三分鐘時維拉第一次有最準確之拉門，峻急非凡，張邦綸眼快手快，抱住皮球，得免於難。無何東華背城一戰，又見活躍。陳明哲得機沿邊單騎直入，正擬獨建奇功，不料爲麥尼蒂衝出暗算，出師未捷身先傷，明哲昏倒塲旁，由醫官急救。東華並不因此氣餒，愈戰愈勇。豈知李寗眼角又流血重傷，相繼退塲，乃用生力軍沈錦達補進，塡張林根之缺，林根　莊友仁位置，友仁則補李寗。未幾陳明哲經過療治，再行入塲。十五分鐘，幼良得一絕好拉門地位，臥地一　，高出尺許越逸，相當可惜。從此僑聯奮發有爲，後勁可畏，攻門層出不迭。邦綸方抱右奪，精彩百出，直至終塲，彼此皆無破門，照章延長二次一五分鐘。東華諸將均現精疲力盡，而力大如牛之義將，亦均聲嘶力竭。草草終塲，空手而返，眞是難解難分之鬥，而市長盃之決實權，除滬警已獲得外，東華僑聯將　期再　，以見高低。</p>
<p>成功失敗焦點所在</p>
<p>東華之守，今戰又發揮其契默之迂迴戰術，絕無漏洞。因此僑聯殊鮮近門叩射之　，可稱東華之意外佳構。前鋒似過於　滯，無衝刺之上將，以故未能擊破麥尼蒂之門，而陳明哲之右翼，無切中之能力，以致減削攻勢，亦所以不能成功之一原因也。僑聯隊最顯著之缺點，厥爲前鋒不能拉門，無的放矢，徒成　餅。遠處冷箭，未臻功夫，易於撲救。守衛方面，尙見費力，故綜論兩方守尙有餘，攻實不足，下次會師，均希有攻的發展，庶幾有成就。</p>
<p>憶念遠走之韓龍海</p>
<p>是役東華下半時以李寗受傷，沈　　補上，幾於偏師應戰，然卒奮鬥到底，打成和局，殊屬難能可貴。觀乎陳明哲之軟弱，　誤　機。不禁令人想起今已　滬遠走之韓　海。社　海　塲，發揮其風火輪式之竄射，在昨戰過程之下，必能一破或竟再破麥尼蒂之門無疑。惜今將軍一去，大樹　零，安得不令萬千球迷黯然神傷哉！</p>
<h3 id="c47">聯葡糾紛案 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>上週聯誼葡商之役，下半時因聯誼吳　祥等之擅自離塲，一部份無知觀衆之入塲行兇，幾　掀天大波，實深遣憾！茲者足聯會已判決聯葡兩隊擇期重賽，並對行動失檢之吳祺祥瞿永福二人分別予以懲處，措置殊屬允當。論者嘗謂滬上華人足球兩巨頭東華與聯誼，雖並稱一時瑜亮，但東華諸將對於運動道德能隨時顧及，聯誼則意氣用事，易肇不歡之局，而吳瞿兩人常爲厲階，致全隊蒙垢，令人扼腕，此言雖不免誅查過苛，然試歷查以往事實，要亦百口莫辯，筆者乃不禁爲祺祥惜。祺祥係一足球全材，鋒衛咸宜，其蹴後衛，更智勇兼備，面面俱到，目下環顧全滬蓋無出其右者，如能抑其驕縱之氣，恪守運動道德，凡事從大處着想，勿斷斷作意氣之爭，則豈不成爲一球藝道德均臻上乘之足球員，爲人人愛戴擁護。祺祥馳騁綠坪多年，奈何竟未體斯旨，而仍一意孤行自入歧途耶、茲祺祥本季已被罰停止出塲，永福亦停止連續出塲機兩次。聯誼雖有與葡商重賽機會，因吳瞿二將之缺席，勢難爭勝，大好錦標，拱手　與胡人，實堪痛心。此後國際盃中，祺祥不出，中華隊後防少此一員虎將，自亦大受影響，惟往者已矣，來者可追，尙望吳瞿兩人經此麼折後，從善如流，痛改前非，東山再起時，一新吾人耳目，寗非一快事哉！</p>
<p>關於球員不服裁判，甚至侮辱裁判之事，前此已屢見不鮮，球員之脾氣燥急者類多犯此，因是每遇重大比賽，輒視擔任裁判爲畏途，其實平心而論，裁判一職，吃力而不易討好。有時情形在兩可之間，更易引起誤會。且在比賽中過程緊張，動作極快，事實上亦難免有失察之處。球員決不可因裁判偶有失察，即認爲不公，而　生怨恨。何况裁判之判斷錯誤，爲裁判之自溺其職，裁判之存心偏袒，爲裁判之自喪人格，萬衆有目共賭，社有會自公論，儘可事後以正當手段，　出抗議，據理力爭。球員如惡言相向，則曲在球員，深望時下各球員注意及之，則球壇前途之辛也</p>
<p>後作者復有不能已於言者，足聯會處決事務，應如此次聯葡糾紛案之當機立斷，不存顧忌，以昭公允，但前僑聯棄權於德商，未即發表。迨僑聯誼比賽後，始行露布，其中究何作用，耐人尋味，至今貽爲口實，而比賽時之濫售門票，對於維特秩序，未能妥爲措置，尤爲衆所識議，足聯會當局不乏明達之士，冀能設法改善，持之以正，則此後之無謂糾紛，或能消患於無形也。（　記者）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Enemy Attempts to Invade the Cagayan Plain; Fierce Fighting in Northeastern Luzon; Japanese Forces North of San Jose Inflict Heavy Losses on the Enemy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy forces have broken through the Caraballo Mountains and are attempting to invade the Cagayan Plain in northern Luzon. Using three or four divisions as their main force, they are constructing roads along the treacherous mountain ridges, gradually approaching Japanese positions to launch a formal attack. From Nahabita, five kilometers southeast of San Nicolas, they are advancing northeastward in four directions. One route, as of the evening of the 9th, has been advancing from a point eight kilometers southwest of Minuli Kwon, south of the Balingit Mountains. Simultaneously, they are constructing eight highways along both sides of the national road from San Jose to Baguio, and another road is being built northwestward from the area northeast of San Jose towards Karanglang, gradually approaching Japanese positions. Near Sara-ir, northeast of San Nicolas, enemy vanguards have been attacking for several days, leading to fierce fighting between the two armies in the dense forests. A portion of the enemy forces even infiltrated Japanese positions. The Japanese forces launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in intense fighting from the 3rd to the evening of the 11th. After inflicting significant losses on the enemy, they were finally repelled. However, a portion of the enemy's main force attempted to circumvent the mountain slopes from the south on the evening of the 11th. The Japanese forces deployed rear units to attack them. At the same time, in the Changkeng area, 15 kilometers north of San Jose, Japanese garrison forces used a small number of troops to engage the enemy head-on, inflicting heavy losses on a division of enemy forces over several days. Japanese losses were also considerable. The Japanese forces, who were tenaciously defending the main positions on the northern highlands, continued to fight fiercely to prevent the enemy from advancing. Furthermore, Japanese units stationed on the western highlands of Karanglang, northeast of Pengkeng, were attacked by enemy forces carrying mortars on February 27th. After fierce fighting, they killed or wounded about half of the enemy troops and repelled them. On March 1st, they again ambushed 200 enemy troops, killing 60 and forcing them to retreat. Since then, although the enemy has launched attacks daily, the Japanese forces have still secured their positions. The enemy has hastily constructed a new motor road, desperately supplying it to advance the 105mm and 205mm howitzer and 155mm cannon positions. Shells are raining down, and Japanese forces are engaged in fierce battles day and night. Numerous guerrilla groups are using small paths in an attempt to attack the Japanese rear, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Moreover, the enemy is eager to break through the Caraballo mountain range, and the attack on the Cagayan Plain is fierce, with roads and bridges being destroyed, and major villages turning into scorched earth. Therefore, the battle situation is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>

In addition, a large number of light machine guns, rifles, and various munitions, fuel, grain, and warehouses were destroyed.</p>
<p>Philippines, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy forces in Zamboanga approached the left flank of the Japanese defenses at noon on the 13th. The Japanese forces lured the enemy to within several dozen meters before concentrating artillery fire on them. The enemy repeatedly attacked with tanks leading the charge and using large-caliber guns. However, after sustaining heavy blows from the Japanese forces, they retreated with severe losses. Enemy forces on the right flank also attempted to attack but were unable to advance due to heavy Japanese artillery fire. On the evening of the 13th, Japanese air units launched a bombing raid. A large fire broke out in a supply warehouse near the enemy airfield, and it was still burning on the morning of the 14th.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On Iwo Jima, under heavy enemy pressure, the Japanese forces are united in fighting bravely, launching counterattacks amidst a rain of incendiary bombs. On the night of the 14th, enemy forces continuously shelled Japanese positions. From the morning of the 15th, they launched attacks with mortars, tanks, and flame throwers. The Japanese garrison forces bravely fought back, tenaciously defending their positions and preventing the enemy from infiltrating. Although most of the island has fallen under enemy control, the Japanese forces continued to firmly defend positions such as the northern villages as of the 15th.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Shortage of Coal and Cotton Under Chongqing's Rule <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the CCP's official newspaper, "Liberation Daily," recently published an article titled "A General Overview of January Under Chongqing's Rule." According to the article, the shortage of coal and cotton in the areas under Chongqing's jurisdiction at the end of January was becoming increasingly serious. The production of heavy industries such as steel, machinery, power, hardware, and electrical equipment continued to decline, and some factories were unable to maintain operations and were put up for sale.</p>
<p>Industrial Depression</p>
<p>For example, the cotton inventory of the textile industry was only enough to last for one month. In addition, more and more shops in various industries were closing down, and several financial institutions also suffered misfortune (such as Chongqing Yongmei Hou Bank), causing turmoil in the financial sector. All of this was caused by the Kuomintang's big bureaucrats' monopoly of capital and the failure of control policies. At the same time, speculative capital has shifted from gold, US dollars, and bills to spot goods, causing prices to soar. Cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guiyang have experienced a surge of two times from mid-December to the end of January, and the purchasing power of the people has been extremely weak recently, so high prices have further promoted the crisis of industry and commerce, and the people's suffering is even worse than before.</p>
<p>Financial Crisis</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the Kuomintang adopted "a palliative measure" of alleviating the crisis, such as canceling the monopoly and instead levying a monopoly profit tax, and collecting taxes from January to March. However, 40 million piculs of land tax from last year have not yet been collected. Under these circumstances, it can be imagined how painful it would be for the local people to be burdened with such a large sum (a total of 25 million piculs of grain and 20 billion yuan).</p>
<p>In order to make up for the huge deficit, the Kuomintang authorities distributed all financial expenditures to the local areas (such as the youth army preferential treatment fees), reaching 40 million yuan in Shaanxi Province and 200 million yuan in Sichuan Province. However, flat-rate rice for government employees and teachers was not paid in goods, but replaced with cash, in order to reduce food expenditures as much as possible.</p>
<p>Currency Inflation</p>
<p>Therefore, the Kuomintang's finances still had to rely on the printing press to maintain itself. In the second half of last year, the amount of banknotes issued reached 30 billion yuan. It is expected that vicious currency inflation will become even more serious in the future. Under this situation, the industrial and commercial sectors have successively requested adjustments to official prices, reduction of burdens, and abolition of extortionate taxes, especially opposing the control policy. Furthermore, the export industry associations and the industrial giants of the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce demanded the abolition of unified purchase and sale, and the cotton textile industry also protested against the control of yarn and cloth.</p>

<h3 id="e13">An Ideal <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuying</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The number of public welfare and charitable organizations and temples in Shanghai probably cannot be matched by any other city in the world. Just counting those registered with the Bureau of Social Welfare, there are over two hundred public welfare and charitable organizations and over two hundred temples. In addition, there are undoubtedly many more that are not registered. Among these many organizations and temples, a few may be nominally existent, which is unavoidable, but most have considerable financial strength. If all these resources could be pooled together, the sheer magnitude of the sum would probably surpass that of any large enterprise or bank.</p>
<p>Because China has traditionally held moral principles in high esteem, "saving others" is often prioritized over "saving oneself." Therefore, public welfare and charitable endeavors, as well as religious temple activities, have flourished. This is generally the case throughout the country, but Shanghai, being the center of economy and culture, has developed even more prominently in this regard.</p>
<p>In any country or city in the world, the will of large capitalists can often influence politics. However, Shanghai is different. The so-called capitalists often hide behind certain prominent figures and rely on these figures to influence politics. The most important criterion for becoming a so-called prominent figure is "enjoying doing good and being generous." Even if one does not have money oneself, being able to persuade others to contribute, or finding ways to make others contribute, to achieve the goal or appearance of "enjoying doing good and being generous," is enough to meet the requirements of a prominent figure. This philosophy of prominent figures is only understood by the Chinese people of Shanghai. For a century, under the high pressure of British and American influence in Shanghai, only "public-spirited" and courageous prominent figures could come forward and say a few words, and their words carried the most weight. This has led to the development of public welfare, charitable, and religious endeavors in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The development of public welfare and charitable endeavors in Shanghai has undoubtedly greatly alleviated the suffering of impoverished citizens. The amount of money spent on relief efforts each year is shockingly large. Although, due to various difficulties, the government cannot strictly manage these endeavors, and many relief organizations are unwilling to disclose their financial situations, we can roughly estimate that these many relief organizations each have their own administrative staff, accountants, treasurers, and even service workers. In total, this probably amounts to no fewer than two thousand people. Although it is not as large as the entire municipal government, it is much larger than an ordinary bureau or department. With such a large administrative expense, the amount spent on charitable work is, of course, even greater. Is it not a blessing for Shanghai to have such a large sum of money for public welfare and charitable relief being used for impoverished citizens?</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Despite the thriving state of public welfare, charitable, and religious relief efforts in Shanghai, the city has not become a paradise. Tragic hellish phenomena are still visible everywhere. Beggars, vagrants, thieves, disabled people, and those without recourse fill the streets. There is also a consistent unemployment rate of more than two-tenths of the total population. These tragic phenomena are, of course, crises that have accumulated throughout history. We certainly cannot say that the existence of these phenomena is a failure of past relief efforts. If it were not for the various relief endeavors, Shanghai might be in an even worse state than we can imagine. However, it is undeniable that the relief efforts have not been fully successful, and thus have only saved a minority, rather than the majority or even all of the people in need.</p>
<p>I believe that no one in Shanghai would express dissatisfaction with the various relief endeavors and their responsible parties. However, the existence of various hellish phenomena implies that people have even greater expectations of the relief endeavors and their responsible parties. In a normal ideal, beggars, vagrants, and thieves would not be widespread within a country. Even if unemployment occurred, there would be an urgent effort to provide relief. Therefore, countries like Japan, Germany, and even England and America, have made unemployment relief very widespread. But in China, unemployment has long become a common and unremarkable thing. The so-called social relief work is overwhelmed just by helping those who are beggars, vagrants, thieves, disabled, old, and weak.</p>
<p>Unemployment relief is originally the most fundamental and essential element of social relief, as well as the most fundamental approach. In China's past social relief measures, some impoverished people were housed and provided for. When there was more money, they were given rice to eat; when there was less money, they were given congee. If it was "winter relief," they were even given cotton-padded clothes to wear. This approach, while good, cultivated a widespread dependence. If we can raise the goal of relief, focusing on unemployment relief, without hindering the enterprising spirit of "self-reliance" of the general public, then the burden on the relief providers can naturally be reduced, and those being helped can also increase their self-confidence.</p>
<p>In Shanghai society, riddled with problems, suddenly proposing unemployment relief would undoubtedly be seen as an illusion or a fantasy. With so many unemployed people and such weak economic power, what can be done with empty hands? For example, following the approach of general countries, with the government passing a huge budget to provide unemployment benefits to unemployed citizens, this would be fundamentally impossible in the current Shanghai. Furthermore, if we were to ask the various relief organizations to bear the responsibility of unemployment relief, they are already feeling stretched thin and facing extreme difficulties in helping those they have already taken in. How could they then go on to help the unemployed? But, in reality, the urgency of unemployment relief may superficially appear to be less than other forms of relief, because the unemployed are not immediately starving to death or immediately resorting to theft. But, in fact, they are only refraining from begging or engaging in other immoral behaviors out of a sense of shame. If we study the life experiences of the general public, the period of unemployment is often a most critical juncture. Despair over life during unemployment makes it the easiest time for people to fall into depravity. The so-called beggars, vagrants, etc., all once had jobs. Unfortunately, they experienced a period of unemployment, and for a time had no way to find employment again. Once they fell, the darkness of their existence obscured their ambition. Even if they were later offered a job, they would be unwilling to do it. Therefore, we can still save a person when they are unemployed. If we wait until they become "idle people," we will not be able to save them even if we try. Currently, the various relief organizations in Shanghai have exhausted their efforts in helping the orphaned, elderly, and weak. There are also many idle people such as beggars, vagrants, and thieves that there is simply no way to manage. Standing guard police officers can only watch them. The severity of the unemployment phenomenon will cause the number of these idle people to increase day by day.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>If society does not provide relief when unemployment occurs, it will inevitably decline and become unmanageable. Many progressive countries, although their public welfare, charitable, and religious relief endeavors are not as developed as those in China, are much more active in unemployment relief than China. They provide unemployment benefits to those who have difficulty finding a job despite their poverty. The government specifically sets up job placement agencies to provide people with job searches and employment guidance, spending huge sums of money on this each year. Because they provide relief for unemployment, people are prevented from falling into depravity and becoming so-called idle people. Therefore, the need for shelter and relief organizations of the charitable type is also reduced.</p>
<p>Because China has not addressed the issue of unemployment relief, many people have no choice but to sink into despair when they become unemployed. The elderly and weak become beggars and vagrants, while the strong become thieves and bandits. Once a layer of idle people has formed in society, it is naturally difficult to attempt to provide relief for them. The current situation in Shanghai is that everyone is spending great effort to provide relief for idle people, but as a result, the original idle people are not being completely saved, and new idle people are constantly emerging. Only focusing on relieving idle people is akin to "ladling boiling water to stop the scalding." If, in addition to relieving idle people, we also pay attention to unemployment relief, we can "remove the firewood from under the pot." The original idle people can be gradually relieved, and new idle people will no longer be created. At that time, even if Shanghai cannot yet be called paradise, the phenomenon of hell will at least no longer expand and spread.</p>
<p>The severity of the unemployment phenomenon in Shanghai makes it such that no one with great power or vast resources dares to lightly talk about relief. It seems that just talking about unemployment relief would not be enough, even with three or five large banks, or that the municipal government would have to add double or several times more to its budget. According to the general practice of cities in other countries, unemployment relief is one of the major administrative policies of the city. The local government of Shanghai has always attached importance to this issue. However, since there are no three or five large banks that can be used for unemployment relief, and it is impossible to suddenly increase the budget several times without overburdening the citizens, and there are no readily available resources, and the government cannot propose a budget, then the unemployment problem in Shanghai will continue to be left to its natural course, with no relief sought. The phenomenon of hell will continue to expand, and after a few more years, idle people will fill the streets, and shelter organizations and police organizations will be unable to accommodate or manage them. The entire Shanghai will truly become hell.</p>
<p>Unemployment relief in Shanghai is the central work of social relief, as well as the fundamental approach to social relief in Shanghai. However, the government has no pre-existing money, and it is not easy to propose a new budget to increase the burden on citizens. So, should we simply ignore the extremely serious problem of unemployment, which is deeply concerning to all countries in the world? After serving as the director of the Bureau of Social Welfare for half a year, I have gained a very profound impression from experience: although relief endeavors in Shanghai are particularly developed and numerous, they all seem to be passive, or even wasteful. —I am truly sorry to say these words to the many enthusiastic public welfare and charitable gentlemen who do good and are generous. They are working diligently day and night to relieve poverty, exhausting their strength and losing their voices, and yet I am here making light of their efforts, which is simply too cruel. However, neglecting the relief of the unemployed and focusing solely on the relief of the idle is ultimately passive, not active, in terms of the effectiveness of relief. Furthermore, that kind of "giving for the sake of giving," only emphasizing "merit" without paying attention to the effect, is also not commendable.</p>
<p>To start unemployment relief in Shanghai, a huge amount of funding is needed. The government has no pre-existing money and cannot propose a new budget to increase taxes. However, the social sector has a large amount of readily available funding, namely the various public welfare, charitable, religious, and other relief endeavors. Not only do they have huge amounts of donations coming in each year, but they also have large fixed assets. If these large fixed assets and regular donation income could be pooled together, reorganized, and managed, then while maintaining the existing relief endeavors, we could also take into account the urgent need for unemployment relief. Then the serious unemployment relief problem could be started. As long as the unemployment relief problem can be started and can attract the attention of the majority of people, it will be very possible to ask the municipal government to propose a new budget or raise temporary funds in the future. When society pays attention to the unemployment problem, but the unemployment relief problem itself is a tangled mess with no way to start, then of course the government cannot accept it, and in fact, no one can specifically bring it up.</p>
<p>Unemployment relief in Shanghai cannot be solved by simply issuing unemployment benefits and setting up job placement agencies like foreign countries. Because the government does not yet have the financial resources to issue unemployment benefits, and there are basically no production enterprises that need workers to set up job placement agencies, the former relief method is something that no one dares to imagine, and the latter will not be effective even if it is implemented. The biggest reason for the existence of unemployment is due to declining production. Therefore, solving unemployment still requires attention to developing production. And developing production requires capital. This again makes me think of the foundation of the various existing relief endeavors in Shanghai. If this existing foundation can be substantially developed, paying attention to the development of production enterprises or helping the improvement of existing production enterprises, then not only will the assets of the various relief endeavors not be chronically frozen or kept in the hands of so-called philanthropic crooks, but also every development and improvement of production enterprises will absorb a considerable number of unemployed people. This is to fundamentally save the suffering of the impoverished. In religious terms, it is the greatest "merit." A small number of so-called philanthropic crooks, wanting to take over the assets of the relief endeavors, often use the protection of public property as a shield to reject all improvement measures and refuse all inquiries from social figures and the government. In fact, as long as financial transparency is thoroughly implemented, public property can never be taken away by any private individual. Otherwise, the philanthropic crooks who shout about "protecting public property" only know how to freeze public property in their own name, but are unwilling to disclose the overall financial situation of the endeavors under their management to society. They nominally provide overprotection, but in reality, they have long been nominal rather than actual.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly describe "an ideal" in my mind below. Call it a new opinion on social relief in China, or call it a small suggestion on unemployment relief in China. I hope that the public will pay close attention to it, and I would be very grateful for any frank guidance and criticism.</p>
<p>1.  Every citizen residing in this city, except for the elderly, disabled, or those still in education, should have a fixed occupation. Unemployed citizens or unemployed citizens should register for work at a place designated by the government. Residents who are unwilling to work or who temporarily do not have a suitable occupation may be required to provide their labor or pay a heavy donation by the government.</p>
<p>2.  All public welfare, charitable, and religious organizations in this city that have the purpose of social relief and have fixed assets should bear the responsibility of unemployment relief, that is, they should all organize production enterprises within their possible scope to absorb unemployed people. When necessary, they may jointly establish an unemployment relief committee to pool their efforts and work together on unemployment relief.</p>
<p>3.  The property of any public welfare, charitable, or religious organization in this city must not be frozen or stranded in an intangible form. The organization should publicly solicit and study methods of using the property for production, both to increase the organization's own income and to reduce panic from social unemployment. Citizens may report and accuse those who still hide and freeze or strand property, and the government should severely punish the responsible parties.</p>
<p>4.  Each public welfare, charitable, and religious organization may organize production enterprises to absorb unemployed people according to its nature and scope. For example, native-place associations and local guild halls may transport native products from their hometowns to Shanghai for processing, manufacturing, and sales, and absorb unemployed people from their hometowns; temples and churches may establish production enterprises near their locations and absorb unemployed people from among their monks, Taoists, and followers; industry associations and guilds may establish production enterprises or new pilot projects in their respective industries, and absorb unemployed people from their respective industries.</p>
<p>5.  The production enterprises run by each public welfare, charitable, and religious organization should aim to reduce unemployment through social relief, not to make a profit. Therefore, even if their enterprises suffer losses, as long as it is not due to fraud, embezzlement, or the fault of the managers, the losses can be made up with newly received donations. However, the operating status of their enterprises must be publicly reported on a regular basis and filed with the government.</p>
<p>6.  The municipal government should give special protection to and pay close attention to the production enterprises run by each public welfare, charitable, and religious organization. When necessary, the municipal government may lend working capital or provide special subsidies.</p>
<p>7.  The municipal government should regularly conduct registration of specialized talents, job placement, and vocational guidance, prepare to provide subsidies to the unemployed, and, when necessary, carry out major construction projects such as road construction, river dredging, and mining to provide relief through work. The government may also raise funds to run appropriate production enterprises and public enterprises. In order to promote unemployment relief, the government may increase its budget or temporarily issue public bonds and treasury bills. Because relieving the unemployed is a thorough and active relief, while relieving idle people is a temporary and passive relief. The former is fundamental relief, while the latter is putting the cart before the horse.</p>

Recently, it has been heard that some people are privately transferring these discarded coupons, claiming that these rice purchase coupons can be used to ration 1.5 dou of rice per period, and that rationing will begin soon, which is entirely baseless. It is said that quite a few people have been deceived. In addition, it is understood that a new method has been established for civil servant rice purchase coupons, and that the same rice coupons issued by the office for the 13th to 18th periods will also be uniformly invalidated.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Remittance General Bureau is now promoting postal remittance business in various regions. The voucher funds originally issued for remittance in second- and third-class postal bureau areas were determined based on the amount of security deposit paid by the responsible personnel in charge of the bureau. However, recently, postal bureaus in various regions have frequently felt that they are insufficient for use, causing the remittance business to be affected and suspended. According to sources from the bureau, in order to facilitate the voucher funds used in various regions, the bureau has planned to implement a flexible measure to relax the amount of voucher funds, and is currently requesting instructions from the highest authorities.</p>

<p>Regarding the capital increase of member banks and money shops of the Silver and Money Industries Association, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, it should be completed by the end of this month. Although all banks and money shops actively proceeded in accordance with the order in advance, they deeply felt that the procedures were insufficient. Therefore, as of now, the number of banks and money shops that have completed the capital increase is less than three-tenths for banks and less than two-tenths for money shops. It is understood that the two industry associations, considering the approaching deadline, have jointly requested the financial authorities for a three-month extension on behalf of their members. It is not yet known whether the authorities will allow it. According to sources from related parties, some banks and money shops in the silver and money industries, whose capital increase has not been completed, are planning to merge two into one.

<h3 id="e25">Director Fan of the Land Bureau Answers Questions on Municipal Land Administration Issues: The Eighth Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The eighth regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held in Room 139 of the Municipal Government Building yesterday (the 17th) at 2:30 PM. Director Fan Yongzeng of the Land Administration Bureau (Secretary Wang substituting) attended to answer questions raised by representatives from various newspapers. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Land Designated for Commercial Use</p>
<p>(1) (Question) After the incident, many pieces of land in this city were designated by the Allied navies. Subsequently, this land was converted to commercial use, with bamboo and timber yards established there. However, the owners have not been able to enjoy any rights for several years, nor can they reclaim the land for their own use. When consulting the owners of these bamboo and timber yards (who are Chinese citizens), they are always unreasonably rejected. Can your bureau provide appropriate protection for the rights and interests of the aforementioned owners? (Asked by the Chunghua Daily News)</p>
<p>(Answer) After the incident, if the Allied navies needed to use land in this city, they would inform the Municipal Government, which would then instruct the owners to complete leasing procedures. The bureau has no knowledge of the subsequent uses of the land. If the original owners of the land can clearly prove that it is occupied by ordinary commercial businesses, they can apply to the bureau, which will then inquire with the relevant authorities and handle the matter to provide basic protection.</p>
<p>Work After the Dissolution of the Housing Management Committee</p>
<p>(2) (Question) After the dissolution of the Housing Management Committee, it is said that the work will be taken over by the Land Administration Bureau. What is the recent progress? (Asked by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Answer) After the dissolution of the Housing Management Committee, the bureau was ordered to take over. The bureau started receiving the files yesterday (the 16th). As for the future work, we intend to continue processing those that are definitely unregistered land and properties after receiving and sorting the files. For those already registered with the bureau, we will not conduct additional investigations and registrations.</p>
<p>Slow Application Registration Procedures</p>
<p>(3) (Question) The Land Administration Bureau is slow in processing various application registration procedures. What is the reason? (Asked by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Answer) For various registrations handled by the bureau, such as transfers and mortgages, if the evidence is solid and the procedures are complete, they are processed immediately on the same day without delay. However, for old cases where property rights were disputed or involved in court proceedings, a detailed review of the files and maps is required, which inevitably takes some time. Furthermore, people often lack sufficient evidence or proper procedures, or their addresses are unclear, making it impossible to deliver notifications. This causes delays due to the people's own mistakes.</p>
<p>Very Few Land Reports</p>
<p>(Question) What has been the situation with land reporting in the city over the past year? (Asked by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Answer) The Land Administration Bureau's land administration work focuses on surveying, measuring, exchanging certificates, and registration. Land reporting was a temporary expedient measure after the incident. After receiving the files, we are handling them according to the regulations before the incident. Land reporting is no longer emphasized. However, if people come to the bureau to report for some reason, we still accept it. Recently, there have been very few such cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Fei Youyuan writes in a letter: "As my little grandson celebrates his one-month milestone, we have received many generous gifts from relatives and friends. We are deeply grateful. However, given these difficult times, we dare not indulge. We respectfully transfer 30,000 yuan of the congratulatory gifts to your esteemed newspaper's education fund, to bring blessings to our relatives and friends."</p>
<p>Women's Day Donation for Education</p>
<p>A letter from all female students from the seven counties of Shaoxing studying in Shanghai reads: "Editor: 'The problem of women is also the problem of men,' said one student. 'We are living a hard and difficult life. Can we consider this prancing, chattering, and joking as a commemoration of March 8th?' said another. 'Let's commemorate March 8th by intensifying our studies, tightening our belts, and raising money to support student loans.' This principle was unanimously decided.</p>
<p>In a few days, relying on everyone's hard work, the donation results have exceeded the original target of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>In the Mayor's Cup football semifinal, Tunghua faced Overseas Chinese United yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at Yiyuan Stadium. The audience was very enthusiastic, a rare sight this season. As a result, both sides were unable to score, and the game remained a virgin score even after extra time. A replay will be scheduled. The referee was Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. In the first half, Tunghua's offense was very aggressive, but all attacks were cleared by McNitty. In the second half, the game remained a back-and-forth affair. Chen Mingzhe penetrated deep into enemy territory and collided with McNitty, Chen left the field injured. Adding to Tunghua's misfortune, Li Ning collided with Bao Jie while trying to intercept a dangerous ball. Li suffered a cut to his eye, bleeding profusely, and temporarily left the game. Shen Jinda filled the gap, and Chen Mingzhe also returned to the field. After this, Overseas Chinese United's offensive became quite strong, but goalkeeper Zhang Banglun was agile and avoided being ambushed. After ninety minutes, the two sides shook hands and agreed to a draw. In extra time, Li Yao of Tunghua took two long shots, both missing by inches. At twenty-five minutes, Sun Jinshun, with the help of Dai Linjing, took a fierce shot in the penalty area. Although the opportunity was good, the angle was inaccurate. After that, both sides were exhausted from the long battle, and the game ended hastily, with no score.</p>
<p>Tunghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning (up), Zhang Lin Gen (down), Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Keng Fuzhen, Shen Jinda (down), Zhang Lin Gen (up), Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Chen Mingzhe.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Key Rationing in Nanjing - Per Capita <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The material rationing system has been adopted by various countries during wartime and has long been recognized as the best system for solving people's livelihood problems in the face of material difficulties. If it can be planned comprehensively and implemented carefully so that everyone can obtain reasonable consumption, it will be of great importance for saving materials and enhancing combat power. The rationing system in the capital city started two years ago, and recently there have been reforms in key rationing. The only two places in our country where key rationing has been implemented successively are Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Distinctions in Rationing Focus</p>
<p>In Nanjing, the agency responsible for material rationing was initially the Municipal Economic Bureau. Later, the bureau was ordered to be abolished, and a "Nanjing Special City Material Rationing Committee" was established within the municipal government, with the mayor as the chairman and relevant officials as committee members, directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal administration to handle political rationing.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of key rationing, the rationing targets focused on the general public, using the household registration of the district offices as the standard, with approximately 700,000 people receiving rations based on their certificates. At the same time, civil servants, soldiers, police, schools, newspaper offices, and cultural groups also had the right to enjoy rations, but this rationing was subordinate to the citizen rationing.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen political rationing and enhance its effect, the rationing authorities planned to change to a key rationing system at the end of last year. Therefore, the main targets shifted from citizens to civil servants, soldiers, police, and cultural figures. The rationing quantity for these people would be more than that of the general public. Currently, approximately 100,000 people in the city enjoy key rationing, accounting for about 15% of the city's population. Among them, news reporters and school teachers enjoy relatively more, because these people are relatively poor.</p>
<p>Types of Materials Already Rationed</p>
<p>Rationed materials are currently limited to items such as sugar, salt, cigarettes, and flour. Rice rationing has been effectively stopped since the government implemented the salary rice system for civil servants and citizen rationing was changed to key rationing. Currently, it is limited to the food rice rationing for the residences of political officials of various agencies and the low-priced rationing for teachers of various schools. In February, the rationing price per stone was only 8,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The sugar rationing is one catty per person, sometimes half a catty. Currently, the rationing price is 900 yuan per catty, and the rationing date is uncertain. Flour is rationed very few times. The most recent time, the quantity was large, with the highest rationing quantity reaching half a bag per person, with each bag costing 4,000 yuan. The most frequently rationed item is cigarettes. To date, 29 periods have been rationed, almost at least once a month, with most being medium-grade cigarettes. Other daily necessities such as soap and matches are rarely rationed, and it seems that they are also, like rice rationing, biased towards senior government officials, such as the soap rationing at the end of last year, where specially appointed officials were allocated one box each, simply appointed officials were allocated twelve bars each, and recommended and commissioned officials were allocated one bar each. There is also winter coal rationing, but it is limited to specially appointed and simply appointed officials.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Poor Cultural Figures</p>
<p>In addition, there is a special type of rationing that has recently been specially favorable to poor cultural figures.</p>
<p>Poor cultural figures, as the name suggests, are of course limited to a part of the cultural figures who live a poor life. Anyone who has a considerable reputation in literature, drama, poetry, and fine arts in writing, and who lives a relatively poor life, or who regularly writes and earns a living, and is certified by newspaper or magazine authorities, can also enjoy this privilege.</p>
<p>Although the total number of poor cultural figures in the city has not yet been counted, it is definitely not small. After review and qualification, there are already 66 people, including Wu Guan. The materials that have been rationed are flour and cigarettes, and the rationing price is the same as the general one. Items that are still being planned include soap, sugar, matches, coal, and other major food items. It is not a praiseworthy thing that the City is implementing key rationing with special rationing measures for poor cultural figures.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Luzon Island: The Japanese Human Bullet Charge Units – A Great Wall of Flesh and Blood Resist the American Oil and Iron Torrent <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the enemy's invasion of Luzon Island, a month and a half has passed. The battle line stretches 250 kilometers from Lingayen to Manila. The enemy has further landed fresh troops at both Nasugbu and Subic, as well as the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island. It is estimated that the American forces used on Luzon have reached twelve divisions, 200,000 men. However, under the absolute air supremacy of the American air force, which totals over a thousand sorties daily, the Japanese army and navy soldiers show towering ambition and great prowess, charging day and night in hand-to-hand combat. This has caused the Americans to bleed profusely. Since the landing, American casualties have reached 70,000. Under the overwhelming material offensive of the enemy, the Japanese forces on the Philippine Islands, overcoming all adverse conditions, bravely fight on. Their courageous acts are born of the Japanese army's belief in ultimate victory. Here are some past stories of bloody battles fought by the Japanese army on Luzon for the readers' edification.</p>
<p>Selfless Spirit</p>
<p>Worthy of special mention in this Luzon Island campaign is the "Human Bullet Charge Unit" devoted to serving the country. If "the Special Attack Force is the flower of the Battle of Leyte Island", then the essence of the Battle of Luzon Island is the Human Bullet Charge Unit. The Special Attack Force consists of select soldiers and officers. However, the Human Bullet Charge Unit consists of the entire ground force, regardless of soldier or officer, which is especially unique. It has been seen that a certain unit headquarters had only the unit commander and staff officers, but no orderlies. When asked why, the unit commander replied with a proud demeanor, "They have all gone out to charge! It will be our turn soon!" The entire ground force waved their precious swords and rushed into the enemy lines with bombs. American soldiers, shielded by aircraft, tanks, and artillery, attempt to advance. However, at night, it is the Japanese human bullet charge unit's turn. The soul-stirring, fierce hand-to-hand combat of Atzu, Saipan, and Tinian is being constantly re-enacted throughout Luzon today. These human bullet charge units, sometimes as small as three men, seize every opportunity to disrupt the enemy lines, establish meritorious service, and return. If there is a good opportunity, they attack again. Sometimes the entire unit charges, ensuring that the Americans bleed profusely. To call it magnificent is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Therefore, although we would very much like to write about each of these brave warriors of the human bullet charge unit individually, when you grab one of them and ask for his name, these heroes, who are willing to be nameless, reply: "The human bullet charge unit is not just us. You should write about the anecdotes of the Special Attack Force that perished with enemy ships." This kind of selfless and grand spirit is truly moving. Every night, Luzon Island becomes the stage for these brave warriors, launching fierce night battles against the materially superior American forces.</p>
<p>American Wastefulness</p>
<p>Relying on gasoline, steel, and sheer quantity, the American tactical thinking in this Luzon operation has reached its near pinnacle. Although the Japanese Special Attack Force repeatedly attacks fiercely, the Americans still gathered 150 to 200 large and small ships at Lingayen before landing. For days, they carried out fierce bombing raids with hundreds of carrier-based and land-based aircraft, and conducted naval artillery fire, destroying all obstacles along the Lingayen coast before landing. After landing, they maintained their consistent style, not hesitating to use 200-kilogram bombs to bomb a single hut or a single person. American infantry never advance an inch without the cover of this steel torrent. A certain Japanese squad's position once received 2,000 rounds of gun and artillery fire from the front in a single day. The Americans even wasted dozens of shells on a single Japanese soldier. For example, the Japanese garrison in Manila received a concentrated barrage of over 10,000 shells in a two-kilometer defense zone in one day, and was also subjected to fierce bombing by enemy aircraft. Since the start of the Luzon operation, the Americans have used the airfields of Lingayen, San Fabian, and Dagupan, in cooperation with the air power based in Leyte and Mindoro, to constantly harass Luzon with B24, B25, P38, P30, P51, PBY, and A20A aircraft, attempting to control the skies with over a thousand sorties of aircraft. However, the Japanese soldiers on Luzon Island resolutely resisted under this material pressure, causing the Americans to bleed profusely.</p>
<p>Night Raids</p>
<p>While the Americans advance during the day under the cover of aircraft, tanks, and barrages, the Japanese launch night charges and engage in hand-to-hand combat, ravaging the enemy lines. The actions of just three or five Japanese soldiers can instantly overturn the American heavy artillery positions that roared constantly during the day, crush the American tank formations in one fell swoop, and establish results that the Americans cannot achieve even with hundreds of rounds of gun and artillery fire and dozens of aircraft. Therefore, even with the cover of thousands of aircraft sorties daily, the Americans have suffered over 70,000 casualties in a month and a half of the Luzon operation. This proves that the flood of oil and steel cannot easily wash away the Great Wall of flesh and blood built by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Battle Situation</p>
<p>From the Battle of Leyte Island to the Battle of Luzon Island, the vortex of the war situation has shifted from south to north. As the landing at Lingayen turns into a battle in Manila and its surroundings, American propaganda is again calling for operations on the Chinese mainland or an invasion of the Japanese mainland. However, the Luzon battle is now gradually transitioning from preliminary skirmishes into a major decisive battle.</p>
<p>Since the American landing on Luzon Island, one part has invaded Manila, while the rest have crossed the northern Bataan Peninsula, advanced north from Nasugbu, and landed on Corregidor Island on the Bataan Peninsula, attempting to forcibly break into Manila Bay. On the other hand, a portion of the American forces is also gradually infiltrating the Santo Tomas, Biñan, and Taal areas in the southern part of the Central Luzon mountain range near Lake Lanao. According to American propaganda, the Japanese army has already been cut into four sections. But is that really the case? A careful review of their deployment reveals that the MacArthur army only relies on the cover of aircraft and tanks to secure a narrow strip of land along the highway in the Central Luzon Plain. The American forces gathered in the Biñan area consist of 15 divisions, of which two or three divisions have already been routed in the fighting around Lingayen and during their southward advance. The landing operations at Nasugbu and Subic are also slow to progress, and the American forces landing at Lingayen are gradually suffering fierce attacks from the Japanese army in the areas of Clark Field, Biñan, Orani, Moriones, and Manila, having already lost over 70,000 men. In other words, the elite Japanese forces, skillfully utilizing the mountains and terrain of Luzon to set up ambushes, are scattered behind and on the flanks of the Americans. If there is a good opportunity for an aggressive attack, they will cut off the American lines of communication from Lingayen to Manila in one fell swoop and encircle them. And the other American forces in other areas are also in danger of being defeated piecemeal.</p>
<p>The strategic advantages that the Americans possess are their superior air power of over a thousand aircraft and the logistical support of over a million tons of ships. In short, they are fighting solely based on quantity. To fight against such an enemy is not easy. However, the Japanese army is united in its belief in victory, and is compensating for the lack of steel with flesh and blood. Today, the Japanese army on Luzon Island is carrying out this spirit, striking the American forces as much as possible and causing them to bleed profusely.

<h3 id="e39">The Pao-Chia System in Shanghai <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Jiwu</p>
<p>In recent years, due to changes in the environment, social unrest, and unstable public order in this city, the Pao-Chia organization has arisen to adapt to the new situation. However, in an international city interwoven with individualism and Anglo-American thought, we ultimately feel that implementing an organized and disciplined Pao-Chia system is a very difficult task.</p>
<p>Under the principle of "mutual assistance in guarding and watching," the initial Pao-Chia work has already demonstrated its effectiveness. Assassinations, robberies, and all destructive terrorist acts in Shanghai's unique environment have gradually been eliminated. However, in the overall Pao-Chia administration, due to the diversity of laws and regulations and the lack of unified authority, it is still impossible to completely address the situation, leaving citizens at a loss.</p>
<p>After the recovery of the concessions, the Shanghai municipal government declared a landmark unification. The authorities deeply felt that in the construction of a Greater Shanghai and in ensuring public order, the Pao-Chia work should shoulder greater responsibility. Therefore, the Pao-Chia organizations of the former International Settlement, the former French Concession, and the areas beyond the boundaries of the Xuhui district were merged. At the same time, in order to actively implement the police-Pao-Chia connection, a Pao-Chia Office was established in the police bureau to specialize in this matter and strengthen it.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Pao-Chia Office, due to the fact that the Pao-Chia organizations in this city had historically been independent, with no fixed income and expenditure, and that the personnel were of mixed quality, it was quite difficult to carry out the reorganization work. Fortunately, with the sincere cooperation of the authorities and all parties, various facilities were gradually developed.</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the Pao-Chia organization began, the Pao-Chia committees of the former International Settlement and the French Concession Bureau, and the Pao-Chia Guidance Committee of the International Settlement Police Station, were merged to form the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau Urban Area Pao-Chia Committee, with relevant personnel from the police bureau, Lianbao chiefs, local gentry, and celebrities as members. Underneath this was the district committee, which became the advisory body for Pao-Chia at all levels, so that government orders could be quickly implemented and public sentiment could be conveyed upwards, and the authority of Pao-Chia was also moving towards unification.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai opened as a port a hundred years ago, there has never been accurate household registration statistics, and the general public has been like a sheet of loose sand. Some people have lived in the same house all their lives without interacting with each other, full of the "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door" mentality. After the establishment of the Pao-Chia, the first step was to carry out a thorough household registration check, so that petty criminals and all kinds of undesirable elements had nowhere to hide, and the citizens also restored the ancient virtues of mutual assistance and mutual support. This cannot but be said to be a small achievement in the Pao-Chia work.</p>
<p>The greatest task of the Pao-Chia is to organize the masses and guide the masses. Therefore, the Shanghai Self-Defense Corps has fully developed this point, practicing the traditional virtues of the Pao-Chia, guarding and defending themselves on the one hand, and assisting the military police in eliminating bandits and all criminal activities on the other hand. Recently, through active training and organization, the headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps has also been established, with Police Bureau Chief Zhou serving concurrently as the Corps Commander and the Chief of the relevant department serving as the director of the Corps Headquarters' command and supervision work, almost becoming one with the police bureau. At the same time, in the past, there have been Self-Defense Corps members who died in the line of duty and those who were awarded prizes for bravely capturing thieves. This is something we can be proud of and must encourage ourselves to do more of.</p>
<p>Regarding the income and expenditure of Pao-Chia funds, it is easiest to arouse the public's concerns. Because the Pao-Chia funds in each district are collected arbitrarily in different ways, either by soliciting donations from businesses or by attaching them to rent in proportion, each district governs itself. At the same time, it is inevitable that unscrupulous elements will exploit the good people. Therefore, the Pao-Chia Office has specially formulated a unified method for collecting funds, with 80% of the proceeds being used as Pao-Chia funds for each district and 20% being used for overall facilities, implementing the principle of "taking from the people and using it for the people" and making it completely public. Therefore, the situation of raising money in the name of Pao-Chia may be prevented in the future.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the quality of Pao-Chia personnel is uneven, and because of the system and laws of the police bureau, the population is often relocated, and applications for residence permits and service in the Self-Defense Corps are often subject to coercion and retention. The authorities are troubled by the lack of information and evidence, and have no way to start. We hope that the public will understand and cooperate in reporting such cases, and at the same time, we must make the Pao-Chia personnel practice self-discipline.</p>
<p>The Pao-Chia organization is truly a bridge between the government and the people. The Pao-Chia personnel bear the responsibility of assisting in maintaining public order, supervising, and reporting all social crimes. Therefore, we deeply admire the spirit of the Pao-Chia comrades who bury their heads in hard work. At present, due to the high cost of living, the Pao-Chia Office has submitted a request to the authorities to include full-time Pao-Chia workers in the priority allocation, which has been considered by the authorities and will soon be satisfactorily answered. The comrades who are working hard in the Pao-Chia position can work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>The situation is becoming more urgent, and our work is also developing rapidly. In terms of air defense and police affairs, the Pao-Chia comrades bear the greatest responsibility. Recently, we will also use the power of the Pao-Chia to assist in the work of evacuating the population of this city. When citizens return to their hometowns, a "evacuated and returned" mark will be stamped on their transfer documents to prevent abuses. At the same time, it is absolutely forbidden to create any difficulties when applying for a move, and we will strive to find effective ways to ensure that the evacuation work proceeds smoothly.</p>
<p>In the past, Mayor Chen often taught us that in addition to autonomy and self-defense, we must also be self-reliant and self-strengthening, build an excellent system, organize the masses, train the masses, and make them have unity and discipline, and expand the concept of loving the local area to loving the country and loving East Asia. Now, Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo attach great importance to the Pao-Chia work and want our Pao-Chia comrades to assist the government, supervise and report on undesirable elements in society, and consolidate public order. Therefore, the responsibility in the future is even greater.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the unification of Pao-Chia administration and to strengthen the organization, the Urban Area Pao-Chia Committee recently invited Secretary-General Luo to serve as the chairman in order to provide guidance and leadership. At the same time, the Pao-Chia Propaganda Committee has also contacted the Shanghai Branch of the News Association and will be established soon, cooperating with the Health Committee and the Transportation Committee to jointly promote the construction of Pao-Chia.</p>
<p>We, the comrades who are at the forefront of the Pao-Chia work, have been working hard for several years, but at present, the Pao-Chia in Shanghai is still not as perfect as we would like. However, we have confidence and do not care about success or failure, praise or criticism. We will only work hard without asking for rewards, and under the leadership of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, we will open up our new world. However, in the current great era, we also hope that people from all walks of life will cooperate with us with a sense of shared destiny and move forward together.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Evacuation and the Railroads <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Huirong</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai has been carrying out the evacuation of its population; however, the majority of the people are still hesitating. When we investigate the reason, we have to attribute it to the inconvenience of transportation. Even for single people, buying a ticket and getting on a train requires half a life. On the road, the yellow uniforms and black hats will also yell and shout. This is the case for those who are traveling light. If one is supporting the elderly and carrying children, and has some luggage, then they can only stop and stare in despair. Therefore, the majority of people have the attitude of "it's better to live one day at a time than to suffer immediately after returning home". Based on personal experience, taking the train does indeed have two difficulties.</p>
<p>Buying a ticket is the first difficulty: now there are fewer trains, and the number of tickets is limited; you have to fight your way to get a white market ticket, and there is no guarantee that you will be able to buy one. It is very problematic to make the elderly and children fight their way in the cold. Also, tickets are limited to being purchased in person, but the elderly and children do not have residence permits. If you buy a black market ticket, you will not only pay a high price, but it is difficult to buy one without knowing someone. It is difficult to buy all the tickets for the whole family, and it is difficult to determine the date. Even if you buy them, you are afraid of being ripped off. To return home, the difficult hurdle of buying a ticket is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Carrying luggage is the second difficulty: people who are evacuating to their hometowns to escape disaster must bring at least the clothes and some indispensable items for the four seasons. These items must of course be packed in luggage. However, recently, the luggage rooms at train stations have often stopped accepting shipments of suitcases and bedding. When you call to inquire, they say you can ship them, but when the shipment arrives, they will temporarily say that shipments have been stopped. I don't know how many people waste their money on transportation like this every day. If you don't bring clothes and bedding, you can't return to your hometown; people who have spent a lot of effort to buy tickets end up having to return halfway because of their luggage.</p>
<p>Let's say that you are lucky enough to have your luggage shipped; problems arise after you arrive at your destination. Not to mention giving tips, items are often missing. Recently, a friend who took a train from Shanghai to Bengbu had his luggage lost and was in a dilemma. He wrote in a letter: "...I went to the station to pick up my luggage, and when I opened it, half of my belongings were gone. I am unfamiliar with the place and have no way to negotiate". The black hats want money, and the red hats want things. There are so many obstacles to taking the train, and you must ask the transportation authorities to improve the current situation in order to evacuate.</p>

<p>Evacuating the population is essential today, but students often abandon their studies in the middle of relocation, which has a significant impact on their education. Therefore, I believe that school authorities should quickly take the following measures to suit the needs of the environment and remedy this deficiency. (1) Do not take a break this semester (stop Sundays and all other holidays) and continue teaching. (2) The semester should end no later than the end of April. In order to cooperate with the evacuation work, it is hoped that wise educators will discuss a good method. (Thank you)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Red Buses Should Be Modified – Yi <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The current red buses play a very important role in the transportation of this city. A large group of people is lined up at each station, and you have to wait at least half an hour to get on the bus. The company is certainly doing its best to maintain the service, and it is difficult to ask for more vehicles to be added. I have a method that indirectly makes the bus larger and carries more passengers: that is, ask the company to remove all the seats in the bus. This way, at least one-third more passengers can be carried. In other words, this would save each passenger more than ten minutes of waiting time each time.</p>
<p>The original intention of installing seats in the bus was to make passengers comfortable, but now it has become a burden for those who get on later; the back and waist are pressed against the horizontal handlebars of the seats, and people in front are squeezing desperately, making people sore and painful. This is the experience of the majority of people who get on the bus at the middle station.</p>
<p>Removing the seats is beneficial and has no drawbacks.</p>

<h3 id="e43">The Island <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Yema</p>
<p>I was captivated by a brightly colored oil painting of an island.</p>
<p>"Do you love the sea?"</p>
<p>"Yes, when I think of islands."</p>
<p>"Islands?"</p>
<p>"Islands of eternal spring, beyond the sea."</p>
<p>"So you love islands more deeply than you love the sea."</p>
<p>"Some love the sea because of the tsunami during storms; some love the sea because of its color, and the brightness of the sea and sky; some love the sea because of the shells on the beach. A poet said, 'My ears are seashells, loving to hear the sound of the sea.' But I, it is because overseas there is the land of eternal spring..."</p>
<p>"The island in this oil painting..."</p>
<p>"Exactly, this is the scene of the island I saw in my dreams. You see, besides the white clouds, the blue sea and sky, and the reddish-brown rocks beside the beach, this island only has simple, lush greenery."</p>
<p>"Green is the color of life."</p>
<p>"However, green alone is not enough to express life. Simple green sometimes has its own special sense of sorrow. If it can express life, express youth, it is still because of the matching of other colors. Don't you see that if there were no clouds, sea, sky, and rocks, the colors of this painting would not be so bright!"</p>
<p>"You have fallen in love with the colors of this oil painting!"</p>
<p>"No, color can only be used as a means of expression. Only the fantasy of the actual scene of the island at the bottom of the oil painting is what I yearn for. Have you ever heard the story of a young man who sailed away and never returned for years? Some laugh at him as a fool because he had no goal in this journey, but having no goal is precisely the goal. The young man who sailed away will never be understood by the world. He went to find an island of eternal spring, a world of perpetual recording."</p>
<p>"Did he find it?"</p>
<p>"Who knows? Anyway, he never returned. A year later, a lovelorn girl was still secretly crying and missing him; five years later, some people still pointed to his sealed house and talked about him; ten years later, people were busy with life, and gradually forgot him in the midst of their toil. Twenty years, thirty years... The young man had completely disappeared from people's memories."</p>
<p>"So this young man never had any news after that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that young man never appeared again. Until an uncountable number of years and days later, a broken, dilapidated boat drifted back from overseas. The boat ran aground on the beach. When an old man with a full head of white hair walked ashore, he opened his confused eyes and showed surprise. Many children gathered around to look at him, looking at this strange person. He walked to the former residence of the young man. Now the house had collapsed into a graveyard. He asked the names of one or two villagers. The children all claimed that they were their grandfathers and grandmothers who had died many years ago."</p>
<p>"Who is this old man?"</p>
<p>"Who is this old man? Not a single child, not a single young person could know. It wasn't until a paralyzed old man heard the children talk about the strange old man when they came home in the evening that he knew that he was the young man who had sailed away many years ago."</p>
<p>"Did he find the island of eternal spring?"</p>
<p>"Did he find the island of eternal spring? Who knows? In short, no one knows these things."</p>
<p>"Then your story...?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my story ends here. The old man disappeared again at dusk that day, leaving only the dilapidated boat on the shore."</p>
<p>After a pause, I heard a soft sigh.</p>
<p>"This is a lonely story."</p>
<p>"Lonely and tragic."</p>
<p>"...Oh, I know, you are the young man who sailed away in that story?"</p>
<p>"But my black hair shows my youth."</p>
<p>"Then..."</p>
<p>"Don't believe the story too much. The story is not necessarily true. In another story, the young man who sailed may have found the island of eternal spring he yearned for."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<h3 id="e44">Spring-Gazing Grass <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Lanyu</p>
<p>The story of the spring-gazing flower</p>
<p>Have you ever heard the story of the spring-gazing flower? The spring-gazing flower blooms in the season when spring has not yet arrived. When spring arrives, it quietly withers, accompanied by its own fading red in the spring light.</p>
<p>1.  Spring News</p>
<p>Pushing open the window, there is a patch of azure sky in the small courtyard.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blows, bringing a different feeling.</p>
<p>It's about time, it should be spring.</p>
<p>I have spent many winters. In some long, cold days, I curled up in the dark old house, listening to the north wind shaking the bare plane trees outside the window. Looking at the swift-flying birds in the gray sky, I often couldn't help but feel some vigilance, some trembling.</p>
<p>"Have I already become stiff?" I asked myself in panic.</p>
<p>But the soul was asleep, and there was no answer. Only the north wind shook the window, whistling sharply...</p>
<p>However, I finally felt spring.</p>
<p>A pigeon flew in from the azure sky. It should be a messenger, bringing some spring news to the world.</p>
<p>"I also want to be a messenger," I said to the pigeon.</p>
<p>I told the spring news to the earthworms; to the weeping willows; to the green mountains and clear waters. Returning, I had a hard-earned dream.</p>
<p>In the dream, there were azalea blossoms all over the spring mountains, and orioles singing through the willow embankments; in the misty spring rain, there was a shepherd boy riding on the back of an ox wearing a straw cape, and I was vaguely that shepherd boy, although I couldn't play the flute, nor had I ever herded cattle.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I was still in the small room. Although it had started to rain outside the window sometime, there was no fragrance of flowers here, no song of birds. What I saw at the window was still the gray wall of the neighbor's house. After being rained on, it looked patchier.</p>
<p>This was just a dream. Spring night dreams are often absurd. My imagination went too far.</p>
<p>This is not a dream; this is a yearning.</p>
<p>It is a yearning caused by spring news.</p>
<p>2.  Green Shoots</p>
<p>The stone slabs in the courtyard were cracked, revealing strips of mud. In the past few days, some green sprouts have gradually grown.</p>
<p>Whose planting is it? - I should thank the planter. He planted spring in my small courtyard. Although the place is small, who says this is not a ray of life in this gray world?</p>
<p>Who knows when it grew, how it grew; was it dropped by a flying bird? Or the achievement of ants? For a whole winter, I didn't see a trace of it. The mud was frozen, coldly.</p>
<p>I cheered, I jumped, I found spring in my small courtyard.</p>
<p>I yearned to find a second pile of green shoots.</p>
<p>So I carefully, yearningly, searched every strip of earth like an earthworm.</p>
<p>But, no.</p>
<p>Disappointed? No, not disappointed at all.</p>
<p>I just regret that I don't have the strength, otherwise, I would move the stone slabs one by one. Underneath, I believe I will find more spring colors!</p>
<p>And the sky finally has some greenness.</p>
<p>I love these lovely little lives, I watered them.</p>
<p>An unknown bird flew over the wall and chirped.</p>
<p>Is it saying that the pile of green seedlings will bloom soon?</p>
<p>3.  Swallows</p>
<p>"Swallows return to build their nests."</p>
<p>The east wind has long blown, please ask the swallows to come back and build their nests!</p>
<p>But, until now, I have not seen a single swallow from those years return.</p>
<p>Every year, there are often two purple-clad swallows, picking mud and grass in front of the steps, accompanying me through spring.</p>
<p>Swallows fly in pairs in spring, I stand alone in front of the steps, and have also spent many spring days...</p>
<p>But, on a bleak autumn day, the swallows fluttered away.</p>
<p>Since then, there has been no news, and I have never seen them come back.</p>
<p>The owner waited patiently, waiting, but never saw the familiar shadows sweeping across the vast sky.</p>
<p>I miss them, I miss them uneasily.</p>
<p>I want to ask the clouds, ask the birds, ask the east wind, when they pass over the fields, have they seen my swallows?</p>
<p>I want to find them, I want to call out, towards the horizon, the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>4.  Withered Branches</p>
<p>The withered branches lost all their yellow leaves in autumn.</p>
<p>In the whistling of the north wind, they swayed their slender trunks several times, but they stood upright again several times.</p>
<p>Standing upright, standing upright, stretching their slender arms into the gray sky.</p>
<p>Yellow leaves filled the desolate garden, the desolate garden was deserted. The withered branches were also lonely.</p>
<p>Another winter was spent in loneliness.</p>
<p>Now, new tender leaves have grown on the withered branches.</p>
<p>New tender leaves, growing on the bare branches, tender and green, smiling in the spring sun.</p>
<p>Looking at their children growing on their own scars, doesn't the withered branch have a trace of joy?</p>
<p>It didn't wait in vain.</p>
<p>Do you say the desolate garden is still deserted? Weeds will grow quickly. "The spring breeze blows and brings them to life again," hasn't the spring breeze already blown?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, here, under the withered branches, there will be the footsteps of children carrying paper kites...</p>
<p>5.  Coda</p>
<p>The east wind, mixed with the fragrance of wildflowers, slowly blows, and I smell the scent of soil.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten the Buddha's words:</p>
<p>"If winter has already come, will spring be far behind?"</p>
<p>Yes, spring is not far away.</p>
<p>I also heard the cry of the dreamer Fang Zisheng:</p>
<p>"Look! It's the sun outside, it's spring."…</p>

<p>The second Mayor's Cup semi-final between East China and Overseas Chinese United was held at Yiyuan Stadium at 3:30 pm yesterday. Yesterday, the spring breeze was gentle and the weather was pleasant, so thousands of fans poured in from Xianyang Road, making it the most ideal game of the season.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Mayor's Cup, last season was the first, and the right to decide the final was for the East China and Overseas Chinese teams. East China won the championship with a 6-1 victory, and this scene is still vivid in my mind. However, this year East China seems a little deflated, while Overseas Chinese United has been greatly reorganized. Therefore, it feels more intriguing, no wonder there is such a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Each With the Determination of a Last Stand</p>
<p>Before the game, I met with Mr. Cheng Bo'an, Mr. Ye Bohua, and Mr. Xu Zhimo, who are all related to their respective teams. One said that East China would win today, because at the beginning of the season, East China was indeed failing due to lack of practice, but recently, due to the suitability of the weather and the venue, there were many opportunities for training. With sufficient energy, the situation will naturally be good. East China's generals are experienced and can adapt to changes on the spot to deal with the weaknesses of the opposing team. Moreover, the restoration of their reputation this season depends on this Mayor's Cup, and the ambition to win must arise from this. One said that since the formation of Overseas Chinese United, its reputation has been broadcast, but it has not yet won any championships. This is the time to repay the owner's kindness with the most ideal lineup this year. Moreover, both teams suffered setbacks in the league this season and could not ask for a way out. Therefore, East China has the ability to restrain Overseas Chinese United. Overseas Chinese United also believes that East China can be deceived this year. Both sides believe that the opponent is meat on the chopping board, and they are determined to win this battle, and have the ability to win Jingzhou steadily in the final battle with the Shanghai Police. Listening carefully to the reasons stated, each has unique insights. The tension of this game was imagined here by the author. As expected, the two armies did their best, and there were very few mistakes. According to the statutory time, neither side gained anything and the game was extended. It was still a good and fierce battle that was difficult to distinguish. The highlights of yesterday's battle are briefly recorded, and the success and failure points of its battle are evaluated.</p>
<p>Wonderful Moments With Many Thrills</p>
<p>With the help of the wind, East China's offensive was extremely sharp. Within ten minutes, winger Chen Mingzhe lost two balls that could have been scored, which was due to timidity and insufficient experience. In the twentieth minute, Mingzhe's corner kick was just right. Sun Jinshun happened to be there, only about ten yards away from the goal, and no one was blocking him. Asun hesitated and failed, which was not expected for Asun's experience and quick feet. It is said that he did not expect Mingzhe to have such a wonderful kick, so the ball came suddenly and he was not prepared. This statement is reasonable, but losing this excellent opportunity made the audience sigh. In the thirtieth minute, Overseas Chinese United tried to attack, and Bama had the best through ball. Bao Jie and Yatuomali advanced side by side, but Zhang Banglun bravely jumped up from the two of them to catch it, which was a masterpiece. Afterwards, the two armies worked hard on defense, and although they recovered, they also closely followed their opponents. Zhang Lin and Bama had a small misunderstanding, but fortunately it was quickly resolved. In the first half, East China did not gain anything in the strong wind offensive, and ended with 〇 to 〇.</p>
<p>Difficult to Distinguish in Extra Time</p>
<p>In the second half, Overseas Chinese United moved after a long silence, and with the help of the wind, the offensive was not weak. In the third minute, Villa had the most accurate shot for the first time, which was extremely rapid. Zhang Banglun was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and hugged the ball to avoid disaster. However, East China fought back and became active again. Chen Mingzhe got the opportunity to enter straight along the side alone, trying to make a contribution, but he was ambushed by McNetti, and was injured before he could succeed, and Mingzhe fainted beside the field and was rescued by the medical officer. East China was not discouraged by this, and fought more and more bravely. Who knew that Li Ning's eyes were bleeding and he was seriously injured, and he retired one after another. Then the new force Shen Jin was added to fill the vacancy of Zhang Linggen. Linggen replaced the position of Zhuang Youren, and Youren supplemented Li Ning. Before long, Chen Mingzhe re-entered the field after treatment. In the fifteenth minute, Youliang got an excellent shooting position, lay on the ground and shot, which was an inch higher and more missed, which was quite a pity. From then on, Overseas Chinese United worked hard and had a strong stamina, and the offensive came out one after another. Banglun Fang hugged and snatched, full of wonderful moments, until the end of the game, neither side broke the goal, and the game was extended twice for fifteen minutes according to the rules. All the generals of East China were exhausted, and the Italian generals who were as strong as bulls were also hoarse. At the end of the game, they returned empty-handed, which was really a difficult battle to distinguish, and the right to decide the Mayor's Cup, in addition to the Shanghai Police, which had already won, East China and Overseas Chinese United will meet again to see the outcome.</p>
<p>The Focus of Success and Failure</p>
<p>East China's defense played its tacit roundabout tactics again in today's battle, with no loopholes at all. Therefore, Overseas Chinese United was less likely to score near the goal, which can be called an unexpected masterpiece of East China. The forward seemed to be too stagnant, and there were no generals to rush, so he could not break McNetti's goal, and Chen Mingzhe's right wing was not able to cut in, which reduced the offensive and was one of the reasons why he could not succeed. The most obvious shortcoming of the Overseas Chinese United team is that the forward cannot shoot, and the attack is aimless and becomes a pie in the sky. The cold arrows in the distance are not enough, and it is easy to save. In terms of defense, it is still laborious. Therefore, in summary, both sides have more than enough defense and insufficient offense. It is hoped that there will be an offensive development in the next meeting, so that there will be achievements.</p>
<p>Remembering Han Longhai Who Went Away</p>
<p>In this battle, East China fought with almost a partial army in the second half due to Li Ning's injury and Shen's supplement, but they fought to the end and drew the game, which was very commendable. Seeing Chen Mingzhe's weakness, he missed the opportunity. I can't help but think of Han Longhai, who is now far away from Shanghai. If Longhai was on the field, playing his whirlwind-like shooting, under the process of yesterday's battle, he would definitely be able to break or even break McNetti's goal again. Unfortunately, now that the general has gone, the big tree is dying, how can it not make thousands of fans feel sad!</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Case of the Dispute Between the United and Portuguese Teams <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Last week's game between the United and Portuguese teams, in the second half, due to Wu Qixiang's unauthorized departure from the field, and the entry of some ignorant spectators to commit violence, almost caused a great disturbance, which is deeply regrettable! Now, the Football Association has ruled that the United and Portuguese teams will choose a date to replay, and has punished Wu Qixiang and Qu Yongfu for their improper actions, which is quite appropriate. Some commentators have said that the two giants of Chinese football in Shanghai, East China and United, are called Liang and Yu of the same era, but the generals of East China can take into account sportsmanship at any time, while United acts impulsively and easily causes unpleasant situations, and Wu and Qu are often the culprits, causing the whole team to be ashamed, which is regrettable. Although this statement is inevitable to be too critical, if you examine the previous facts, it is also undeniable. The author can't help but regret for Qixiang. Qixiang is an all-round football player, suitable for both forwards and guards. His defense is even more intelligent and brave, and he is all-round. Looking around Shanghai, there is no one who can surpass him. If he can restrain his arrogance and abide by sportsmanship, and think about everything from a big picture, and not make an impulsive dispute, then wouldn't he become a football player who is excellent in both football skills and morals, and is loved and supported by everyone. Qixiang has been galloping on the green field for many years, but why hasn't he understood this principle, and still goes his own way and enters the wrong path? Now Qixiang has been punished to stop playing this season, and Yongfu has also stopped playing for two consecutive games. Although the United has the opportunity to replay with the Portuguese merchants, due to the absence of Wu and Qu, it is difficult to win. The good championship is given to the Hu people, which is really heartbreaking. After this, in the International Cup, Qixiang will not play, and the Chinese team will have one less tiger general in the defense, which will also be greatly affected. However, the past is gone, and the future can be pursued. It is hoped that Wu and Qu will learn from this setback, follow good advice, and change their past mistakes. When they rise again, they will bring a new look to our ears and eyes, isn't it a happy event!</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of players disobeying the referee, and even insulting the referee, it has been seen repeatedly before. Players with a quick temper are prone to commit this. Therefore, whenever there is a major game, they often regard being a referee as a difficult task. In fact, to be fair, the job of a referee is difficult and not easy to please. Sometimes the situation is between the two, and it is more likely to cause misunderstandings. And in the game, the process is tense, and the actions are extremely fast. In fact, it is inevitable that there will be errors. Players must not think that the referee is unfair because the referee has occasional errors, and give birth to resentment. What's more, the referee's judgment error is the referee's self-indulgence in his job, and the referee's intention to be partial is the referee's self-loss of personality. Everyone has eyes and can see, and the community will have its own public opinion. You can file a protest through legitimate means afterwards and argue on the basis of reason. If the players speak ill of each other, then the fault lies with the players. It is hoped that all players will pay attention to it, so that the future of the football world will be good.</p>
<p>Later authors have something that cannot be said enough. The Football Association's decision-making should be as decisive as this time in the dispute between the United and Portuguese teams, without any scruples, in order to show fairness. However, the Overseas Chinese United abandoned the right to the German merchants before, and did not announce it immediately. It was not until after the Overseas Chinese United game that it was announced. What is the role of this, which is intriguing, and it is still a point of contention. The indiscriminate sale of tickets during the game, and the failure to properly arrange the maintenance of order, are especially criticized by the public. There are many enlightened people in the Football Association authorities. It is hoped that they can find ways to improve and maintain justice, so that unnecessary disputes in the future can be eliminated invisibly. (Reported by a reporter)</p>
