<h3>日對華經濟施策　使資源化爲戰力　重光外相闡釋中日各問題</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　關於東亞各問題，護會及政府間之重要質疑，綜合其要旨如次：（一）重光外相於議會再開之第一日，在貴衆兩院會議席上發表外交演說，曾力謂「大東亞戰爭始自中國問題，終於中國問題。」故在日衆院二十三日之預算會席上，中谷武世氏及重光外相即以該演說爲中心，展開問答如次：中谷武世氏問：「中日關係之協調，爲完遂大東亞戰爭之道，外相所謂「大東亞戰爭始自中國問題終於中國問題」何意？」</p>
<p>中日關係協調安定東亞因素</p>
<p>重光外相答：「若東亞人能充分瞭解大東亞宣言之精神，中國能復歸東亞之大義，則東亞之安定當能實現，此即解決中國問題之眞義。然妨碍重慶復歸東亞者，乃爲在華美國勢力，無論軍事上政策上摧毀美國在亞洲之長略勢力，均屬至要。中國復歸東亞之時，日軍作戰目的始能達成，大東亞宣言之旨趣始能顯現。」中谷氏問：「重慶與中共間之暗礁激烈化，中國問題如拋棄國民政府與重慶間之問題之形式的態度，展開積極的政策，未知外相意見如何？」外相答，「重慶工作以直接問題言，華人應率先以之爲中國內部問題，如日本始終根據大東亞宣言之旨趣，推行施策期其澈底，使中圍精神復歸，則極易在中國人士之間發現和平之途徑。於日本之立場，亦應澈底推行和平工作之施策，故在主席繼承國父孫中山先生之遣志，以大亞洲主義爲出發點，在南京政府成立時，亦以全面和平爲號召。繼其遺志之陳公博氏，雖今日仍熱烈以此大精神，努力以救中國，對此更願以所有援助推進施策。」</p>
<p>戰意達於極點施策圓滑進行</p>
<p>中谷氏問：「中國大陸資源之急速戰力化，爲當前急務，決戰之要目及外交的考慮，有無矛盾之處？」外相答，「中日關係根據中日盟約決定一切，中國亦以參戰國之一員資格，始終努力完遂作戰與日本相協力，以物力之協力爲主，對日本完遂作戰上予以極大貢獻，於此點並無若何矛盾，又於全體亦無矛盾，整介均在順利進行，余始終願根機對華新政策之運營施策圓滑向前推進。」中谷氏問，「大東亞本爲亞細亞解放戰，爲使亞細亞全民族之戰意達於頂點，尤不得不展開以中日兩國爲中心之亞細亞民族運動。」緒方國務相答，「民族運動於大東亞建設上，負有極大任務，　亞總本部必能完成此任務。」</p>
<p>收買物資貢獻戰爭</p>
<p>吉田軍需相·前田運通相·與重光大東亞相關於「中國大陸資源急速戰力化爲當前急務問題」，二十三日曾於衆院預算會席上，答田中貢氏之質問，並闡示在當地物資之收買運輸，及當地生產各方面，勢力使資源化爲戰力等實情。重光大東亞相答，收買中國物資，當然與日本戰力具有重大關係，故必須盡可能從事收買，目下正以中國通貨實施收　，然更須充分顫慮戰時通貨之膨脹，物價之高漲。關於此點，現正極力援助中國之施策，爲期中日兩國圓滑推進，關於此點之經濟協力，對收買方法收買機構已有具體方案，其施策正擬逐次予以實現，此等中日兩國經濟圓滑協力之進展，即爲對華新政策之實現」。</p>
<p>英美干政獲一明證</p>
<p>重光外相於二十日之衆院預算總會席上，答復蜡山政道氏質問之外交運用方針，謂重慶實施憲政，乃英美干涉重慶內政實證云云。茲將當日之質問題答辯要旨如次：蜡山政道氏問，「重慶施行憲政問題如何？」重光大東亞相兼外相答謂，「蔣介石於新年致辭時，曾云最近實施憲政，然英美等對從來之一黨專制，認爲獨裁而行攻擊，故要求其實施民主政治，此蓋爲使延安與重慶兩政權妥協故也，此乃實爲英美政府干涉重慶內政之一大左證。方邦有識之士對此無道之干涉必爲之激憤」。蜡山氏問，「願聞大東亞人結合之具體方策，菲大使伐爾伽斯曾提議於東京設置大東亞本部，未悉政府以爲如何？」大東亞相答，「大東亞宣言係大東亞各國之共同意見，大東亞之給團進一步以研究其施策者亦屬當然。</p>
<p>幣制換率無意變更</p>
<p>石渡藏相於廿四日出席衆院委員會，議員質問：「政府對大東亞共榮圈內之幣制換算率，有無變更之？」答謂，「大東亞共榮圈之內，於戰後亦不使用金本位。茲誌其大意如次：大東亞共榮圈之匯兌換算率，若按過去之舊思想行之，則物價一旦騰量時，當予以變更，然現在政府毫無變更之意。」</p>
<h3>堀內公使等返日商討　具體政策即將有所決定</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　我國自參戰後，爲安定民生，確保軍需，乃毅然實施統制經濟政第，期確立戰時經濟體制，增强決戰總力，以完遂大東亞戰爭。二年以來，舉國上下，全力推進，以求達此目的，惟因種種環境之困難，致國內物資生產，無顯著增加，各項物價，有漲無已，國計日益艱困，民生愈形凋蔽，際此大東亞戰爭已突入最後決戰階段之時，關於經濟體制，亟須進一步强力推行。關於此事，國府當局，刻正積極攷慮之中，同時盟邦方面，亦表示願以全力協助，日前日政府第八十六屆議會席上，重光外相曾在答覆衆議院議員質問中謂：「改善中國之窮因經濟，刻正在攷慮新經濟對策。」基於上述旨趣，盟邦駐華陸海軍及大使館當局，即縝密商治該項對策之實施內容，茲悉日大使館堀內公使及上海事務所圖崎參事官，已聯袂返日。又烽情報部長，亦將啓行，對此問題，作具體之商討，此於大東亞戰爭前途，具有深切關係，而爲我朝野上下一致注目，深切熟待之對華新經濟對策，即將有一具體之正式決定。</p>
<h3>日貴院昨開　全體會議</h3>
<p>追加軍費案成立</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日貴族院於本日上午十時，召開全體會議，首先討論臨時軍費追加預算案，全體一致通過，至此八百五十億元之臨軍費預算案遂行成立。繼將衆院送來之關於下年度發行公債法律案等六件，證明提案理由後，交特別委員會。又衆院本日則舉行預算委員會及特別委員會。</p>
<h3>液體燃料急速增產</h3>
<p>東京廿八日中央社電　日衆院廿八日預算第四分科會席上，片山一男氏對於液體燃料確保之重要問題，自各角度提出質問，由吉田軍需相·松村軍需政務次官·難波燃料局長作詳細答辯如次：（一）「急速增產與自給態勢之日戰時之下，南方原油之依存，今後將愈感困難，然於可能內對原油之運送，自當努力。關於原油以中晶滿爲中心之芋類中，採取酒精燃料辦決，今已愈感其使命之重大。又國產原油之增產，希望亦極大，並已逐夾實現，既有此等航空機燃料之原油，人造酒精及松板油等不斷供給，料於完遂戰爭上，可不至有不足之感。（二）「油田開發」，現正開發有希望之新油田。（三）「人造石油」現在增產之唯一目期之效果。（四）「滿洲酒精」滿洲國協議具體之方決倍。</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3>從南京到鎭江</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　澹明</p>
<p>一月二十四日淸晨六時半，記者在天色滕朧中自首都市中心區出發，坐了馬車到下關。原來在預定中之「蘇北之旅」已自今天開始了。經過挹江門，本來誰都要下車，以便警察和憲兵檢查，可是同車有幾位做單帮的，正是那批制服同志的「親戚」，我們也就沾光了。</p>
<p>車站即景</p>
<p>到火車站，時間還是很早，看錶才知只有七時一刻，於是我們一斑旅客就在站門前守候着，七時半鐵門大開，旅客們便一擁而入，大多數沒有買票，熙熙攘攘頓時熱鬧起來，同時兜黑市車票的「黑帽子」也大事活躍。</p>
<p>「先生到那襄去？買票沒有？」</p>
<p>「人擠得　　請你再加上幾百塊錢吧！」</p>
<p>這樣的聲浪不住從我的耳朶旁掠過，幸虧我早已在旅行社買好了票，總算與他們無緣。聽同走的人說，他們有幾位也是到鎮江的，可是二等票價原來只有九百塊錢，擠到票門口，售票員非見你給他一千塊錢就不給你票，出門的旅客那裏還爲了一百塊錢和他爭吵呢？真想不到首都車站的售票員，竟是這樣的舞弊！</p>
<p>首都的車站，正和在其他地方的車站相仿，不爲旅客謀方便，因爲只有這樣，旅客才會拿錢買黑市票，拿錢給黑帽子的排隊排在最前方。頂奇怪的，早快車明明沒有三等，却偏要把二等客人排在三等軋票處。有很多早去的，雖然在二等軋票處排着很長很長的隊，可是等到快要軋票的時候但見黑帽子立上去把「二等」二字的招牌取下，重新把那塊牌示掛到三等軋票處去，於是人頭擁擠，秩序紊亂起來了。儘管以前排隊時曾經交通警察維特秩序，此時顯然也無法維持秩序了。尤其荒謬的，在三等軋票處二等旅客排着兩排隊時，有一隊一定要在軋票員別有用心的企圖下被犧牲的。因爲那位軋票員，只把他所排入的幾位「僱客」軋了票之後，就把鐵桿一橫停止不軋了，於是還隊旅客又不得不八另外的一隊了。有的來不及擠八，就只得另外托他們想辦法了！以前只有售軍的停止售票，現在却又多添了軋票的停止軋票的新把戲，不曉得正在整理舞弊的華中鐵道公司當局，也曾留意到這件事嗎？</p>
<p>鎭江一瞥</p>
<p>十點多車子到了鎮江，從車站到縣政府，是很遠的。從軍站路出來，首先經過賽蓋山路，再從寳蓋山路到新馬路，而雙井路，中山路，最後車子始在省府路的縣政府前停下。泥濘中的街市景色，倒別有一種風格。現在的縣政府區域就是事變前的江蘇省政府。那時省主席辦公的地方——一座洋樓，現在變了江蘇第四區行政督察專員公署，縣政府便設在事變前的省政府民政廳。據說自黃香谷縣長到任後已經修葺一新了。今天眞不巧，黃縣長恰巧不在鎮江，便和縣府秘書潘其璇先生談了半天。潘氏本係國府銓叙部育才司司長，乃經黃縣長懇請幫忙之後，才請假來鎭暫時担負這件工作的。</p>
<p>經過了一度懇談之後，始知潘氏乃是康南海先生的高足，他最近也從華北和蘇北各地遊歷歸來，對於各地縣政確有獨特的見地，黃縣長有這樣一位出色的幕僚，無怪可以受到當地人民的受戴了。鎭江全縣共分七區，人口的有二十多萬，但尙無精確統計。中等學校僅有五所，除省立第十中學之外，僅有鎭江縣立中學（初中），私立成志中學，動進中學和大成中學（初中）。所以敎育事業可說不甚發達，較之事變以前可說相去何啻天壤！尤其這裏的中學，辦到高中三年級爲止的，只有私立成志中學一處，省立第十中學也僅辦到高中一年級爲止！</p>
<p>這裏僅有一張鎭江日報，也只有日出八開一小張，如與蘇州杭州比較起來，也相差太遠，文化的落後也就可知了！電影院比較好的只有中華電影院一家，係中華電影公司直轄，自晚間六時起循環放映，現在正演着「鞠海情濤」。</p>
<p>物價高昂</p>
<p>走過西門大街（這是鎭江現在頂熱鬧的一條街，已改名爲淸鄉路），兩面路旁盡是單帮客人的臨時市場，那裏路旁人行道的攤阪羣集，大都是香煙，火柴和布匹等。至於這裏一般的物價也相當驚人，或和上海相等。頂好的金山飯店，雖然還不如上海的二等旅館，可是住一天也得化二三千塊錢，如果每次在館子裏吃飯，那就每天非萬元莫辦。我國沿京滬綫各大城市物價的高昂。實在是建設和復興前途的障礙！</p>
<p>從淸鄉路向東行去，自寳塔路轉灣，便見銀行林立，如中央儲備銀行，江蘇地方銀行，交通銀行以及其它本地的各小銀行也大多在那裏，可說是「鎭江的垣街」了。</p>
<p>在鎭江一天着時得到了不少活的材料尤其對於縣級政治機關的利弊得失，知道不少。過去地方官吏爲什麽難有出色的成績，結癥在於：第一，做縣長的事權不一定集中，就是他一個人想做的好，還有保安隊，警察局是否也能取一致態度，大成問題。第二，縣府經費太少，例如鎭江僅有每月十七萬元得經費，事實上工作的人員要津貼，地方駐軍要供應，每個月至少也得數百萬元，試問做縣長的不另想別法還有什麽辦法？第三，過去有些縣長依靠背景，非法妄爲，結果最多撤職了事，上級機關缺少嚴厲整飭的決心。（寄自鎭江）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>期望於學校當局</h3>
<p>本市各學校，下學期開學日期，轉瞬即屆，尙未繳淸學費的學生家長，正在焦急張羅。而私立學校收取學費的數目，雖經敎育當局修正徵收標準，較上次公布者增加一倍，但若干學校事實上仍未能依照標準徵收。因而家境淸寒的學生家長，更感難於籌措，有坐視子弟失學的痛苦。</p>
<p>就若干私立學校未能依照標準徵收學費，所持的理由，不外依此標準無法維特學校開支。在當局未能充分配給敎職員工生活必需品以前，未能充分核發補助費以前，事實上無法遵守標準。否則祗有停辦一途。持平而論，本市若干私立學校過去辦理成績比較優良者，對於敎職員待遇確較一般爲高，因此師資水準亦較一般爲高。本來，優良的敎員，有了比較安定的待遇，自能認眞敎育，成績優良。這些學校，抱定「貨眞價實」主義，一面認眞敎育，一面依照實支增加學費。</p>
<p>敎育當局規定收費標準時，顧到一般淸寒家長的負担，顫到敎育前途，經過鄭重考慮而決定的。所以，依照公定標準收費，遺是功令，爲維持功令威信，自有遵守的必要。可是，若干學校不能依照公定標準收費，也是事實的因難，爲顧全事實，因而要求通融。這是目前本市敎育問題中複雜的一面。我們在原則上當然主張維持功令，可是，同時對於若干學校有特殊成績者也不能不桓顧到事實。</p>
<p>我們認爲徵收學費標準，並不是教育當局與學校當局之間發生直接關係的事。實際上是學生與敎師之間的事，因爲敎師敎育學生，學生酬報敎師。敎育與學校常局都居於中間地位而已。準此而言，如果敎師施之於學生的敎育心力是百分，則學生也應當酬之於教師者百分，這是合理的。如果學生酬之於敎師者百分，而老師所得者僅爲五十分，或者老師所施之於學生的教育心力僅爲五十分，在這個比較之間的差數，而由學校當局垂手而得，這是不合理的，敎育當局處於督導的地位，自應加以糾正。</p>
<p>另一方面，敎育當局，學校當局，敎職人員在「服務敎育」的前提下，是站在同一立塲的。因此，如何認眞敎育，如何减少失學，負有同樣的賣任。如果在這樣共同前提之下，就不會發生學費徵收標準上相反意見的。</p>
<p>現在若干學校既然認爲事實上無法依照標準收費，那末，我們提出兩點，務盼學校常局必須估做到：</p>
<p>（一）設定免費或减費學額，儘量容納淸寒學生。我們認爲這一點，無論依照任何征收學費標準的學校，尤其是若千辦有成績，而自認爲無法依照公定標準收費的學校，必須充分做到。學費愈高，淸寒優秀學生愈不易入學，學校對此就應特別體恤，盡量予以减費免費機會，使仍能繼續學業。</p>
<p>（二）經濟絕對公開，無論依照任何征收學費標準的學校都須做到。原有校董會設立的，應由校董會負責監督。無校董會或校董會不健全者，應由專任敎員共同組織稽核委員會，稽核監督。尤其是持有無法依照公定標準征收學費的各學校，首先自動做到。這一點如果維諉隱諱，我們認爲是絕對沒有理由的。</p>
<p>上述兩點，原已在敎育局公布的補充辦法第四五兩項中明自規定。若干認爲無法依照公定標準收費的各校，尤應充分做到，以期取信於社會及學生家長。如果僅此兩點不能切實做到，那末，敎育當局就應干涉糾正。</p>

<h3>市警察局員警　革新外勤辦法　拘捕罪犯由警局協助執行</h3>
<p>市警察局爲杜絕外勤員警　弊，整　警紀，特革新員　外勤辦法。茲將辦法要點誌後：（一）減少崗位：檢討原有崗位之主要性，酌減至必要之最少限度，原來之半數爲標準。（二）預備員：値崗勤務者外之半數員警，得留守於分局內聽候遣差，但員警較少之分局，則不妨半數以下留同。（三）崗位換勤時間。崗位時間以二小時爲標準，但特別塲所及夜間動務，則可親各分局特殊情形而定，不可超過四小時。（四）保甲自警團之運用：爲外勤員警減少，除運用預備員以補助外，更須注意活用自警園負，除値崗勤務外，更實施自警團巡邏，使其養成自衛精神。</p>
<p>市警察局爲確切維諉地方治安，對警政亟力推進，即對員警之待遇，亦將於下月起調整改善，惟查往時有其他機關，於市區內搜查或拘捕罪犯或不法份子時，往往單獨執行，以致誤會業至，故經該局通知各有關機關，嗣後倘在市區內有搜查或拘捕罪犯時，應事先通知該局，或該管轄分局，當派員會同予以協助執行。</p>

<h3>張北生談　蘇北清鄕情況</h3>
<p>蘇北淸鄉督察專員張北生，日前因公抵滬，稍事逗留，中央社記者爲欲明瞭實施淸鄉政策後，蘇北一般情况起見，特走訪張氏於旅邸，承告本人自國府明令第一期淸鄉起，即負責淸鄉工作，直至前年蘇北方面淸鄉開始，遂負蘇北淸鄉之寳，蘇北於民十八九年遭共黨爲患，事變後復有新四軍等作惡，致使民生感受重大威脅，而政治推動亦困難重重。自前年四月間實施淸鄉後，新四軍主力　潰，自前尙有小數民兵艱他之新四軍，當不難消滅。在故主席曾謂「淸鄉必先淸心」，淸鄉之後，一般政治尙不能明期者，實因清鄕工作，在表面上，對象爲新四軍，而實際上，即貪官汚吏，藎貪官汚吏不　清，政治難於明朗也。欲期澄清貪官汚吏，必先使公務員充實其生活條件，故於蘇北方面首先提倡田賦實物制，使公務人員基本生活滿足，不至徇私勒索，同時革除非法捐稅，減輾人民負担，現蘇北情形較爲明朗者，即爲田賦改收實物制度之取得成效。</p>

<h3>南洋中學生提議　組織「中學生團契」　經常推進助學運動</h3>
<p>本報昨接南洋中學「四育團契」來函文云：「諸位先生：我們南洋中壓學生首先舉起了學生助學的義旗，果然得到了轟轟烈烈的響應，現在助學運動將屆結束，我們「再來一個」</p>
<p>這次由屬於靑年會少年部的南中　契發動勸募，得同學們熱烈贊助，於一旬中完成目標，我們仍舊願爲一塊引玉的磚頭，希望各團契響應起來。這屆助學金捐者雖踴躍異常，但到現在爲止，距目標尙遠，其原因大概由於勸募助金並不經常進行吧。所以我們提議：合各中學的受助生成一團契，一方面謀受助生總智體羣四育之發展，一方面經常籌劃勸募助學金之進行。這僅是我們的意見，至於具體辦法等等，有待於關心助學運動諸先生之參酌。」</p>
<p>（按）南洋中學四育團契諸君，贊助本報助學運動的熱忱，我們非常感佩！諸位所提議的各中學受助學生成一團契，一則謀受助學生四育的發展，二則經常推動助學金之進行；關於道一點，我們也很表同情。倘使本報受助大學生團契成立於前，中學生團契成立於後；互相聯繫起來，組織是非常堅强，可以發揮很偉大的力量。現當各校開學之始，慢慢的籌備起來，請大家等着瞧吧！</p>

<h3>Japan's Economic Policies Towards China: Converting Resources into War Power; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Elucidates Various Sino-Japanese Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Regarding various East Asian issues, the key questions between the Diet and the government are summarized as follows: (1) Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in his diplomatic address to both houses of the Diet on the first day of its reconvening, forcefully stated, "The Greater East Asia War began with the China problem and will end with the China problem." Consequently, during the budget committee session in the House of Representatives on the 23rd, Mr. Takeyo Nakatani and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu engaged in a question-and-answer session centered on this speech, as follows: Mr. Nakatani asked: "The coordination of Sino-Japanese relations is the path to completing the Greater East Asia War. What does the Foreign Minister mean by 'The Greater East Asia War began with the China problem and will end with the China problem'?"</p>
<p>Coordination of Sino-Japanese Relations Stabilizes East Asia</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu replied: "If the people of East Asia can fully understand the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and if China can return to the righteousness of East Asia, then stability in East Asia can be achieved. This is the true meaning of solving the China problem. However, what hinders Chongqing's return to East Asia is the American influence in China. It is essential to destroy American long-term strategic influence in Asia, both militarily and politically. When China returns to East Asia, the war aims of the Japanese army can be achieved, and the purpose of the Greater East Asia Declaration can be manifested." Mr. Nakatani asked: "The discord between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party is intensifying. If we abandon the formal attitude of addressing the issues between the National Government and Chongqing and adopt a proactive policy, what is the Foreign Minister's opinion?" The Foreign Minister replied: "Speaking directly about the Chongqing issue, the Chinese people should take the lead in treating it as an internal Chinese problem. If Japan consistently promotes policies thoroughly based on the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, aiming to restore the Chinese spirit, it will be very easy to find a path to peace among the Chinese people. From Japan's standpoint, we should also thoroughly promote policies for peace. Therefore, when the Nanjing government was established under the leadership of Chairman Chen Gongbo, who inherited the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, it also called for overall peace, based on Pan-Asianism. Chen Gongbo, who inherited his legacy, still passionately strives to save China with this great spirit, and we are willing to advance policies with all our assistance."</p>
<p>War Spirit Reaches its Peak, Policies Proceed Smoothly</p>
<p>Mr. Nakatani asked: "The rapid conversion of resources on the Chinese mainland into war power is an urgent task. Are there any contradictions between the key objectives of the decisive battle and diplomatic considerations?" The Foreign Minister replied: "Sino-Japanese relations are determined by the Sino-Japanese Alliance. China, as a member of the participating nations, consistently strives to complete the war and cooperates with Japan, primarily through material cooperation. It makes a great contribution to Japan's completion of the war. There is no contradiction in this regard, nor is there any contradiction in the overall situation. Everything is proceeding smoothly. I consistently hope to smoothly advance the operation and implementation of the new policy towards China." Mr. Nakatani asked: "The Greater East Asia War is essentially a war for the liberation of Asia. To bring the war spirit of all Asian peoples to its peak, it is necessary to launch an Asian national movement centered on China and Japan." State Minister Ogata replied: "The national movement has a great mission in the construction of Greater East Asia, and the General Headquarters for Asia will certainly be able to complete this mission."</p>
<p>Purchasing Supplies to Contribute to the War</p>
<p>Defense Minister Yoshida, Transportation Minister Maeda, and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, regarding the "urgent task of rapidly converting resources on the Chinese mainland into war power," answered questions from Mr. Ko Tanaka during the House of Representatives budget committee session on the 23rd. They also explained the actual situation of purchasing and transporting materials locally, and how local production efforts are converting resources into war power. Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu replied that purchasing Chinese materials naturally has a significant relationship with Japan's war power, so we must engage in purchasing as much as possible. Currently, we are implementing purchases using Chinese currency, but we must also fully consider the wartime currency inflation and the rise in commodity prices. Regarding this point, we are currently vigorously assisting China's policies, with the goal of smoothly promoting cooperation between China and Japan. Regarding economic cooperation on this point, there are concrete plans for purchasing methods and purchasing institutions, and these policies are being gradually implemented. This smooth progress of economic cooperation between China and Japan is the realization of the new policy towards China.</p>
<p>British and American Interference is Clearly Evidenced</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, during the House of Representatives budget general committee session on the 20th, responding to a question from Mr. Masamichi Rōsōyama regarding the direction of diplomatic operations, stated that Chongqing's implementation of constitutional government is evidence of British and American interference in Chongqing's internal affairs. The gist of the question-and-answer session on that day is as follows: Mr. Rōsōyama asked, "What about the issue of Chongqing implementing constitutional government?" Greater East Asia Minister and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu replied, "Chiang Kai-shek stated in his New Year's address that he would implement constitutional government soon. However, Britain, America, and others have attacked the existing one-party dictatorship as authoritarian, and therefore demanded that he implement democratic politics. This is ostensibly to facilitate a compromise between the Yan'an and Chongqing regimes. This is concrete evidence of the British and American governments interfering in Chongqing's internal affairs. Righteous people in our country must be outraged by this outrageous interference." Mr. Rōsōyama asked, "I would like to hear about concrete measures for uniting the people of Greater East Asia. Philippine Ambassador Vargas has proposed establishing a Greater East Asia Headquarters in Tokyo. What does the government think about this?" The Greater East Asia Minister replied, "The Greater East Asia Declaration is the common opinion of the countries of Greater East Asia, and it is natural to further study policies for the group of Greater East Asia."</p>
<p>No Intention to Change Currency Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ishiwata attended the House of Representatives committee on the 24th, and a member asked, "Does the government have any plans to change the currency exchange rates within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere?" He replied, "Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the gold standard will not be used even after the war. The gist is as follows: If the exchange rates within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are managed according to old ideas, they would have to be changed once commodity prices increase. However, the government has no intention of changing them."</p>
<h3>Minister Horinouchi and Others Return to Japan to Discuss Concrete Policies to be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since our country joined the war, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and ensure military needs, we resolutely implemented a controlled economic policy, aiming to establish a wartime economic system and enhance the overall power for the decisive battle, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. For two years, the entire country has been working together to promote this goal. However, due to various environmental difficulties, there has been no significant increase in domestic material production, and the prices of various commodities have risen incessantly. The national economy is becoming increasingly difficult, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly impoverished. As the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive stage, the economic system urgently needs to be further strengthened. Regarding this matter, the National Government authorities are currently actively considering it. At the same time, allied countries have also expressed their willingness to assist with all their strength. During the 86th session of the Japanese Diet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives: "Improving China's economic poverty is currently under consideration with new economic countermeasures." Based on the above intention, the military and embassy authorities of allied countries stationed in China are closely discussing the implementation details of these countermeasures. It is understood that Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi and Councilor Tosaki of the Shanghai office have jointly returned to Japan. In addition, the information department chief will also depart to discuss this issue in detail. This is of profound relevance to the future of the Greater East Asia War and is unanimously watched by our country's public and private sectors. The deeply awaited new economic countermeasures towards China will soon have a concrete formal decision.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers Opens Yesterday: Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Additional Military Spending Bill Passed</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese House of Peers convened a plenary session at 10:00 AM today. First, they discussed the supplementary budget bill for temporary military expenditures, which was passed unanimously. With this, the 85 billion yen temporary military expenditure budget bill was enacted. Subsequently, six bills sent by the House of Representatives, including the bill on issuing public bonds for the next fiscal year, were presented with their justifications and handed over to a special committee. The House of Representatives today held budget committee and special committee meetings.</p>
<h3>Rapid Increase in Liquid Fuel Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the fourth subcommittee session of the House of Representatives budget committee on the 28th, Mr. Kazuo Katayama raised questions from various angles regarding the important issue of securing liquid fuel. Defense Minister Yoshida, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Munitions Matsumura, and Director of the Fuel Bureau Namba provided detailed answers as follows: (1) "Under the wartime situation of rapid increase in production and self-sufficiency, dependence on crude oil from the South will become increasingly difficult in the future. However, we will strive to transport crude oil to the extent possible. Regarding the resolution of alcohol fuel production based on tubers centered on sweet potatoes in Manchuria, we increasingly feel its great mission. Also, the hope for increasing domestic crude oil production is extremely high, and it is being realized step by step. With the continuous supply of such aircraft fuel crude oil, artificial alcohol, and pine oil, it is expected that there will be no shortage in completing the war. (2) "Oil field development" We are currently developing promising new oil fields. (3) "Synthetic petroleum" Currently, the only effect of increasing production in sight. (4) "Manchurian Alcohol" Concretely decided through consultation with Manchuria.</p>
<p>Travelogue</p>
<h3>From Nanjing to Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Dan Ming</p>
<p>On the 24th of January, at half-past six in the morning, I set off from the central district of the capital city while the sky was still dim, taking a carriage to Xiaguan. The "Journey to Northern Jiangsu" that I had planned was starting today. Passing through Yijiang Gate, everyone was supposed to get out of the carriage for the police and military police to check their papers. However, there were several solo traders in the carriage, who were "relatives" of those uniformed comrades, so we all benefited from their connections.</p>
<p>A Scene at the Train Station</p>
<p>Arriving at the train station, it was still very early. Looking at my watch, I realized it was only 7:15. So, our group of travelers waited in front of the station gate. At 7:30, the iron gate was opened wide, and the passengers surged in. Most of them hadn't bought tickets, and the scene became bustling with activity. At the same time, the "black hats," those who scalp tickets on the black market, also became very active.</p>
<p>"Sir, where are you going? Do you have a ticket?"</p>
<p>"It's too crowded…please add a few hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>Such voices kept passing by my ears. Fortunately, I had already bought a ticket at the travel agency, so I had nothing to do with them. I heard from my fellow travelers that some of them were also going to Zhenjiang. However, the second-class fare was originally only 900 yuan, but when they squeezed to the ticket window, the ticket seller would only give you a ticket if you gave him 1,000 yuan. How could the travelers who were leaving argue with him over 100 yuan? I never expected that the ticket sellers at the capital's train station would be so corrupt!</p>
<p>The capital's train station is just like the train stations in other places. It doesn't provide convenience for passengers, because only in this way will passengers buy black market tickets and pay the "black hats" to be at the front of the line. It's strange that even though the express train clearly doesn't have third-class seats, they insist on having second-class passengers line up at the third-class ticket checking point. Many people who arrived early had been standing in a very long line at the second-class ticket checking point. However, just as they were about to check their tickets, a "black hat" would come up and take down the "Second Class" sign, and then rehang it at the third-class ticket checking point. As a result, people became crowded and the order was disrupted. Although traffic police had maintained order when people were lining up, it was obviously impossible to maintain order at this point. What's particularly absurd is that when second-class passengers were lined up in two lines at the third-class ticket checking point, one line was bound to be sacrificed due to the ticket checker's ulterior motives. Because after the ticket checker checked the tickets of a few "customers" he had lined up, he stopped checking the tickets by placing an iron bar horizontally, and the passengers in the line had no choice but to switch to another line. Those who didn't have time to squeeze in had to ask others to help them find a solution! In the past, only the selling of military tickets was stopped, but now there's a new trick of stopping the checking of tickets. I wonder if the Hua Zhong Railway Company authorities, who are in the process of rectifying corruption, have noticed this?</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The train arrived in Zhenjiang after ten o'clock. It's a long way from the train station to the county government. Coming out of Junzhan Road, we first passed through Saigaishan Road, then Baogaishan Road to Xinma Road, and Shuangjing Road and Zhongshan Road, before the carriage finally stopped in front of the county government on Shengfu Road. The street scene in the mud has a unique style. The current county government area is the former Jiangsu provincial government before the incident. The place where the provincial chairman worked at that time - a western-style building - has now become the administrative inspectorate of the Fourth District of Jiangsu. The county government is located in the former civil affairs hall of the provincial government. It is said that it has been renovated since County Magistrate Huang Xianggu took office. Unfortunately, County Magistrate Huang was not in Zhenjiang today, so I talked with the county government secretary, Mr. Pan Qixuan, for a long time. Mr. Pan was originally the director of the Yucai Division of the Ministry of Personnel of the National Government, and only came to Zhenjiang on leave to temporarily take on this job after County Magistrate Huang sincerely asked for help.</p>
<p>After an earnest conversation, I learned that Mr. Pan was a top student of Kang Youwei. He has recently traveled to various places in North and Northern Jiangsu, and has unique insights into the county administration of various places. No wonder County Magistrate Huang can be respected by the local people with such an outstanding staff member. Zhenjiang County is divided into seven districts, with a population of more than 200,000, but there are no accurate statistics. There are only five secondary schools, including the provincial No. 10 Middle School, Zhenjiang County Middle School (junior high school), private Chengzhi Middle School, Dongjin Middle School, and Dacheng Middle School (junior high school). Therefore, the education system can be said to be undeveloped, which can be described as a world of difference compared to before the incident! In particular, among the middle schools here, only the private Chengzhi Middle School offers courses up to the third grade of senior high school, and the provincial No. 10 Middle School only offers courses up to the first grade of senior high school!</p>
<p>There is only one Zhenjiang Daily here, and it is only a small sheet with eight openings a day. Compared with Suzhou and Hangzhou, it is also far behind, and the cultural backwardness can be known! The only better cinema is the Zhonghua Cinema, which is directly under the Zhonghua Film Company. It is screened in a loop from 6:00 pm, and is currently showing "Ju Hai Qing Tao".</p>
<p>High Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Walking along West Gate Street (this is the most lively street in Zhenjiang, now renamed Qingxiang Road), the sidewalks on both sides are full of temporary markets for solo traders, where stalls are clustered, mostly selling cigarettes, matches and fabrics. As for the general commodity prices here, they are quite alarming, or equivalent to Shanghai. The best Jinshan Hotel, although not as good as a second-class hotel in Shanghai, costs two or three thousand yuan a day. If you eat in a restaurant every time, you will have to spend at least 10,000 yuan a day. The high commodity prices in major cities along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in our country are really an obstacle to the future of construction and revival!</p>
<p>Walking east from Qingxiang Road and turning from Baota Road, you can see banks standing, such as the Central Reserve Bank, the Jiangsu Local Bank, the Bank of Communications, and other local small banks. It can be said that it is "Zhenjiang's Wall Street".</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang, I gained a lot of living materials in one day, especially knowing a lot about the advantages and disadvantages of county-level political organs. The reason why it was difficult for local officials to have outstanding achievements in the past lies in: First, the power of the county magistrate is not necessarily concentrated. Even if he wants to do a good job, it is questionable whether the security team and the police bureau can also take a consistent attitude. Second, the county government's funding is too small. For example, Zhenjiang only has 170,000 yuan of funding per month. In fact, the staff has to be subsidized and the local garrison has to be supplied. Each month costs at least several million yuan. May I ask what other way is there for a county magistrate who doesn't think of other ways? Third, some county magistrates in the past relied on their background and acted illegally, and the result was at most dismissal. The superior organs lacked the determination to rigorously rectify.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations of the School Authorities</h3>
<p>The opening date for the next semester for various schools in this city is approaching in an instant. Parents of students who have not yet paid their tuition fees are anxiously preparing. Although the amount of tuition fees charged by private schools has been revised by the education authorities and the collection standard has been increased by one-fold compared to the last announcement, some schools have in fact failed to collect according to the standard. As a result, parents of students from poor families feel even more difficult to raise funds, and suffer the pain of helplessly watching their children lose their schooling opportunities.</p>
<p>The reason why some private schools have failed to collect tuition fees according to the standard is nothing more than that this standard cannot maintain school expenses. Before the authorities can fully allocate daily necessities to teachers and staff, and before they can fully approve subsidies, it is impossible to comply with the standard in fact. Otherwise, there is only one way to stop running the school. Objectively speaking, some private schools in this city that have performed better in the past have indeed given teachers and staff higher salaries than average, so the level of teachers is also higher than average. Originally, excellent teachers, with relatively stable salaries, can conscientiously teach and achieve excellent results. These schools, upholding the principle of "genuine goods at a fair price", conscientiously teach on the one hand and increase tuition fees according to actual expenses on the other.</p>
<p>When the education authorities stipulated the fee standard, they took into account the burden of general poor families, trembled about the future of education, and made a decision after careful consideration. Therefore, charging fees according to the official standard is still a public decree, and it is necessary to comply with it in order to maintain the credibility of the public decree. However, it is also a fact that some schools cannot charge fees according to the official standard, and they ask for accommodation in order to take care of the facts. This is a complex aspect of the current education problem in this city. In principle, we of course advocate maintaining public orders, but at the same time, we cannot but consider the facts for some schools with special achievements.</p>
<p>We believe that the tuition fee collection standard is not a matter that has a direct relationship between the education authorities and the school authorities. In fact, it is a matter between students and teachers, because teachers educate students and students reward teachers. Both education and school authorities are in the middle position only. According to this, if the teacher's educational efforts on the students is 100%, then the students should also reward the teachers with 100%, which is reasonable. If the students reward the teachers with 100%, and the teachers only get 50%, or the teachers' educational efforts on the students is only 50%, in this comparison, the difference is obtained by the school authorities, which is unreasonable, and the education authorities should correct it in the supervisory position.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the education authorities, school authorities, and teaching staff are standing on the same position under the premise of "serving education". Therefore, they have the same responsibility for how to teach seriously and how to reduce the loss of schooling opportunities. If under such a common premise, there will be no conflicting opinions on the tuition fee collection standard.</p>
<p>Now that some schools believe that it is impossible to charge fees according to the standard in fact, then we put forward two points, and we hope that the school authorities must evaluate them:</p>
<p>(1) Set up free or reduced fee quotas to accommodate as many poor students as possible. We believe that this point must be fully achieved by schools that follow any tuition fee collection standard, especially schools that have achieved results and believe that they cannot charge fees according to the official standard. The higher the tuition fee, the more difficult it is for poor outstanding students to enter school, and the school should give special consideration to this, and give as much reduction and free opportunities as possible, so that they can continue their studies.</p>
<p>(2) The economy is absolutely transparent, and all schools that follow any tuition fee collection standard must do it. If there is an existing school board, the school board should be responsible for supervision. If there is no school board or the school board is not sound, a joint audit committee should be organized by full-time teachers to audit and supervise. Especially those schools that hold that they cannot charge fees according to the official standard should take the initiative to do so first. If this point is concealed, we believe that there is absolutely no reason.</p>
<p>The above two points have already been clearly stipulated in Items 4 and 5 of the supplementary measures announced by the Education Bureau. All schools that believe that it is impossible to charge fees according to the official standard should fully achieve this in order to gain the trust of the society and the parents of students. If these two points cannot be effectively achieved, then the education authorities should interfere and correct them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting by Japanese Troops on Luzon Island to Block Enemy's Attempt to Advance Southward; Many Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed in Lingayen Gulf</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the Lingayen Gulf area, from the 18th to the 24th, the enemy forces increased by another one or two divisions, bringing the total enemy troop strength to six or seven divisions. There have been no major changes in the battles in the eastern Anping area. Japanese troops are still firmly defending the first line of defense that links Damortes-Santo Tomas eastward to the Cabaruan Mountains. The enemy forces have been slow to make progress in front of this line of defense. Furthermore, the enemy once invaded the area near Pozorrubio, between the first and second lines of Japanese defense. After the Japanese forces launched a determined assault and concentrated artillery fire, the enemy's momentum has been halted. Meanwhile, a portion of the enemy forces that gradually infiltrated the eastern side of the Cabaruan Mountains has now invaded the area in front of San Manuel and the Daxin'gan area south of it. The enemy forces advancing southward from the Lingayen area are gradually expanding their power southward. On the evening of the 24th, 200 enemy soldiers advanced to the vicinity of Mabalacat and Clark Airfield.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the Philippine Sea area this week, enemy transport convoys have again been active in the Surigao Strait, the Mindanao Sea, the Sulu Sea, and the waters around Mindoro Island. Their activities are primarily focused on linking landing points in Leyte, Mindoro, and Lingayen, and they are aggressively seeking to replenish troops and supplies, or to rapidly construct offensive bases. At the same time, small units of enemy naval vessels appeared on the 21st off the coast of Laoag Currega in northwestern Luzon, and shelled the land. Enemy torpedoes, seaplanes, etc. also launched continuous attacks. In addition, enemy mobile forces used their carrier-based aircraft to attack various islands at the southwestern tip of Taiwan in South China and Annam, attempting to contain the Japanese forces' operations in the Philippines and to control future rear supply lines. Conversely, Japanese kamikaze special attack units and air force units have launched successive attacks. On the 21st and 23rd, three aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and three vessels of unknown type were bombed and burned in the seas east of Taiwan. Furthermore, on the 24th and 25th, enemy warships in Lingayen Gulf were bombed, resulting in the destruction of one enemy battleship, one battleship or cruiser, two destroyers, and one transport ship. In addition, Japanese submarines operating in the southern Philippines used torpedoes to hit several enemy aircraft carriers, transport ships, etc. on the 24th, and are continuing to fight fiercely. Enemy carrier-based aircraft have launched very few air raids on Luzon Island, but attacks by land-based aircraft have been active.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in the Past Week; Japanese Forces Continue to Fight Fiercely in Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A record of the war situation in Greater East Asia over the past week:</p>
<p>Japan Proper:</p>
<p>There has been little recent activity by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing in the Chengdu area. Around 110 enemy B-29 aircraft flew from Mariana Island bases. On the 23rd, more than 70 of them attacked Nagoya. Japanese forces intercepted them, shooting down 13 and destroying approximately 50. It is expected that enemy air raids on Japan proper will intensify in coordination with operations in the Philippines. More than 70 aircraft also attacked Tokyo on the 27th.</p>
<p>Central Pacific:</p>
<p>In the Central Pacific area, enemy aircraft have been persistently attacking the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, with about 20 to 40 aircraft at a time. At night, a small number of aircraft launched attacks a dozen or so times. On the afternoon of the 24th, approximately 40 enemy B-24 and B-29 aircraft attacked again.</p>
<p>Burma:</p>
<p>In the "Nujiang River Area," the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is attempting to open the China-India Highway, attacking Wanting with eight divisions and Namhkam with two divisions. On the 18th, a portion of the Chongqing army invaded the Wanting area. A portion of the Japanese forces launched a bold counterattack and fierce fighting is still ongoing. On the 17th, near Nanbeijia in the area between Wanting and Xucheng, approximately 500 troops from a joint Chongqing-U.S. airlift unit landed. Japanese forces in the area immediately surrounded them and are currently continuing to mop them up. In the "Western Irrawaddy Area," the main force of the newly formed 1st Army 50th Division and the British-Indian 30th Division is advancing southward towards Monywa (approximately 150 kilometers northeast of Mandalay), apparently attempting to cut off the Lashio-Mandalay highway. In the northern Mandalay area, the Chongqing Army's 19th Division and a portion of the British-Indian 36th Division have crossed the Irrawaddy River at two locations, attempting to advance towards the eastern bank. Japanese forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting in this area. In the "Eastern Irrawaddy Area," the British-Indian 2nd Division, the East Asia Army's 11th Division, the West African 20th Division, and the 44th Armored Division, accompanied by tanks and armored units, are advancing towards the northwest Mandalay area.

Japanese forces are engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Furthermore, the activities of the British Indian Ocean Fleet in coordination with the battles on the west bank of the Nujiang River in Burma are noteworthy. Its mobile force attacked Palembang, Sumatra, on the 24th, but suffered a heavy blow from the Japanese Air Force. Out of 140 enemy aircraft, 116 were lost. In the Kaladan area, Japanese forces are currently engaging the West African 81st Division, which is advancing southward, approximately 60 kilometers east of Nisshi.</p>

<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Reforms Patrol Methods; Arrests of Criminals to Be Executed with Police Assistance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in order to eliminate corruption among patrol officers and rectify police discipline, has reformed patrol methods. The key points of the methods are as follows: (1) Reduce Posts: Review the importance of the original posts, reducing them to the necessary minimum, with half of the original number as the standard. (2) Reserve Officers: Half of the officers other than those on duty should remain at the branch office to await dispatch, but in branch offices with fewer officers, less than half may remain. (3) Post Rotation Time: The standard post time is two hours, but for special locations and nighttime duties, it may be determined according to the specific circumstances of each branch office, but should not exceed four hours. (4) Utilization of Baojia Self-Defense Corps: In order to reduce the number of patrol officers, in addition to utilizing reserve officers for assistance, attention must also be paid to utilizing the Self-Defense Corps, implementing Self-Defense Corps patrols in addition to duty posts, to cultivate their spirit of self-defense.</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is vigorously promoting police administration in order to effectively maintain local security, and the treatment of police officers will also be adjusted and improved starting next month. However, it has been found that other agencies, when searching for or arresting criminals or illegal elements in the urban area, often act alone, leading to misunderstandings. Therefore, the Bureau has notified all relevant agencies that in the future, when searching for or arresting criminals in the urban area, they should notify the Bureau or the relevant branch office in advance, and officers will be dispatched to assist in the execution.</p>
<h3>Financial Fluctuations Reoccur in the City Last Week; Banks and Native Banks Lack Cash Funds</h3>
<p>Due to the influence of international winds and rumors, the financial and industrial conditions in the city have been affected in the past week. Ignorant businessmen have been incited to use their available funds to engage in activities in the market, causing financial fluctuations to reoccur. The first half of the week was relatively stable, but in the second half, the rising trend intensified. In the black market, gold prices rose by more than 20%, and the trend of hoarding became prominent. Sycee silver also exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark. Chinese stocks were also firm at the same time, and the popular stocks all rose sharply, with the trading volume increasing significantly compared to the previous week. Banks and native banks lacked cash funds, and merchants and residents also felt a shortage of cash. In order to adjust the capital use of customers, all withdrawals exceeding 50,000 yuan were made with bank transfer orders (i.e., check), to facilitate adjustment needs. At the same time, in view of this situation, the Central Reserve Bank decided to issue new 500-yuan and 10-yuan notes from now on to regulate market demand. It is expected that the past situation of cash shortage can be resolved. As for the interbank lending rate within the past week, the explicit rate remained unchanged, while the implicit rate increased slightly. In terms of industry and commerce, factories are still hoping that the authorities will find ways to increase electricity supply, preparing to resume work and production as soon as possible. The market prices of various major goods also rose secretly with the financial changes, such as rice, grains, oil, sugar, and other daily necessities, but the rising trend was relatively slow.</p>
<h3>Expectations for Factory Power Allocation Are Particularly High</h3>
<p>In order to increase production, factories in the city have repeatedly requested power allocation. The Economic Bureau is currently planning to統盤 coordinate the plan. The Shanghai West Office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that factory power allocation is eagerly anticipated by industry and commerce, and is of great importance to people's livelihood. Yesterday, it submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Municipal Government Economic Bureau, requesting early implementation, so that not only Shanghai West manufacturers, but also all factories in the city can obtain electricity, which is deeply relied on for production.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhao Xuan Will Meet with the Press Today</h3>
<p>Zhao Zunyue, the newly appointed Minister of Propaganda of the National Government, recently came to Shanghai on official business and has been busy with social engagements. It is learned that Zhao will hold a tea party this afternoon with the former Minister Lin Baisheng at the Cathay Hotel to receive Chinese and foreign journalists in the city for his first meeting after taking office.</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch of the New Association Holds Banquet</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association will hold a banquet at noon today (29th) on the 11th floor of the Cathay Apartment to welcome Propaganda Minister Zhao and Vice Minister Sun, and the Director of the Shanghai Propaganda Office, Liu. All newspapers and bureaus in the city will participate at that time.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Mayor Ye Zhendong Discusses Governance Policy</h3>
<p>Ye Zhendong, the newly appointed Mayor of Hangzhou and concurrently the Administrative Inspector of the First District of Zhejiang Province, recently came to Shanghai on official business. A Central News Agency reporter visited him to inquire about his future governance policy. According to Ye, "Having been ordered to transfer to the position of Mayor of Hangzhou and concurrently Administrative Inspector of the First District of Zhejiang Province, my only hope is to relieve the greatest suffering of the people, namely the problem of people's food. After taking office, I will have close contact with various allied agencies to facilitate coordination and ensure the smooth flow of food sources in the city. The second is to suppress prices and crack down on hoarding and speculation. All unscrupulous merchants who illegally raise prices and manipulate major commodities will be severely punished in accordance with wartime criminal law, without showing any favoritism. The above are all passive governance policies.

<h3>Suzhou Native Shanghai Primary School Continues to Offer Scholarships</h3>
<p>Dalu Road, Xinzha Road. The Suzhou Native Shanghai Primary School, established by the Suzhou Native Shanghai Association, has always had a method of preferential treatment for children of fellow natives. The previous period set aside 150,000 yuan from tuition fees to establish an Ai Xiang Scholarship, with a quota of 100 students. This semester, it will continue to be implemented, and the quota will be expanded to 150 students. All children of fellow natives of Suzhou can enjoy the scholarship, which reduces half of the tuition fee. The lower grade only charges 3,200 yuan, the middle grade 3,600 yuan, and the higher grade 4,000 yuan. Those who are unable to pay can have the entire fee waived with proof from the current directors and supervisors of the Native Association. Children of non-Suzhou natives who are indeed from poor families can also apply for reduction or exemption. Those who are aspiring students can go to the school to go through the entrance procedures immediately.</p>
<h3>Zhang Beisheng Discusses the Situation of Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Zhang Beisheng, the Inspector of Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu, recently arrived in Shanghai on official business and stayed for a while. In order to understand the general situation in Northern Jiangsu after the implementation of the Clearing Villages policy, a Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Zhang at his residence. Mr. Zhang said that since the National Government explicitly ordered the first phase of Clearing Villages, he has been responsible for the Clearing Villages work. Until the Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu began the previous year, he was responsible for the Treasure of Clearing Villages in Northern Jiangsu. Northern Jiangsu suffered from the Communist Party in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China. After the incident, the New Fourth Army and others committed evil deeds, causing the people's livelihood to suffer a major threat, and the promotion of politics was also difficult. Since the implementation of Clearing Villages in April of the previous year, the main force of the New Fourth Army collapsed, and it is not difficult to eliminate the small number of militiamen and other New Fourth Army who remain. Former Chairman Zeng said, "Clearing Villages must first clear the heart." After Clearing Villages, the reason why general politics cannot be clearly expected is that the target of Clearing Villages is superficially the New Fourth Army, but in reality, it is corrupt officials and corrupt officials. If corrupt officials and corrupt officials are not清清 cleared, it is difficult for politics to be clear. In order to clarify corrupt officials and corrupt officials, it is necessary to improve the living conditions of civil servants. Therefore, in Northern Jiangsu, we first advocated the system of paying land tax in kind, so that the basic life of civil servants is satisfied, and they will not seek personal gain and extort. At the same time, we reformed illegal donations and taxes, reducing the burden on the people. The more transparent situation in Northern Jiangsu is the success of the system of changing land tax to in-kind payment.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Urges Renewal of Bicycle Licenses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau began to handle the annual first half of the year bicycle licenses in the city on the 25th of this month. The number of car owners who have gone to renew their licenses in recent days is quite large, but some car owners have not understood the license renewal date, and have failed to renew their licenses after the expiration date. It is hoped that they will go to the vehicle registration offices to renew their licenses from now on. In order to facilitate car owners and avoid crowding, the Bureau stipulates that each registration office will renew 500 vehicle licenses per day. The vehicle number and renewal date of each vehicle are posted at the door of each vehicle registration office. It is hoped that car owners will pay close attention.</p>

<h3>Nanyang Middle School Students Propose to Organize a "Middle School Fellowship" to Regularly Promote Scholarship Movement</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from the "Four Education Fellowship" of Nanyang Middle School yesterday, which stated: "Gentlemen, we, the students of Nanyang Middle School, first raised the banner of student scholarship, and it really received a huge response. Now that the scholarship movement is coming to an end, we are going to "do it again."</p>
<p>This time, the Nanzhong Fellowship, which belongs to the Youth Association's youth department, launched the fundraising campaign, and received enthusiastic support from the students. The goal was achieved in ten days. We are still willing to be a brick to attract jade, hoping that all fellowships will respond. Although donors for this scholarship are exceptionally enthusiastic, the distance from the goal is still far, probably because fundraising is not conducted regularly. Therefore, we propose to combine the students who receive scholarships from various middle schools into a fellowship. On the one hand, we will seek the development of the students' collective intelligence, physical fitness, spirit and society. On the other hand, we will regularly plan and raise scholarship funds. This is just our opinion. As for specific methods, etc., it is up to the gentlemen who care about the scholarship movement to refer to."</p>
<p>(Note) We are very grateful to the gentlemen of the Four Education Fellowship of Nanyang Middle School for their enthusiasm in supporting our scholarship movement! We also sympathize with the fact that you propose that the students who receive scholarships from various middle schools form a fellowship. On the one hand, we will seek the development of the students' physical, intellectual, social and moral education. On the other hand, we will regularly promote the scholarship fund. If our newspaper's university student fellowship is established first, and the middle school student fellowship is established later, the organization is very strong when they are linked together, and it can exert a great force. Now that the school year is starting, prepare slowly, and please wait and see!</p>
<p>Lucky Money Coupons to Be Used to Raise Scholarships</p>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store wrote in a letter: "In our country's old customs, every Lunar New Year, relatives and friends give children lucky money to show friendship and encourage children, which is not too critical. However, in recent years, prices have risen sharply, and the amount of this lucky money has also doubled, often in the thousands, which is not a small amount. And during the New Year, there are street vendors lining the streets, and gambling is rampant. Children are ignorant, and they all cherish their lucky money, playing happily in the vendor's array, or buying and eating indiscriminately, which damages their gastrointestinal tract, or buying firecrackers and throwing them away, causing trouble, or even participating in gambling, developing greedy habits. What was originally intended to love them is just enough to harm them. In view of this, our company is issuing lucky money coupons, which can be redeemed for any daily necessities at any time. Our company will also donate 11% of the total amount of coupons sold to the Shen Xin Scholarship Fund, so that poor children can benefit from the tithe, save unnecessary waste, and use it for legitimate needs."</p>
<p>(Attached method for issuing lucky money coupons)</p>
<p>(1) Sales start today, (2) The face value of the coupons is divided into 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and one miao; (3) They can be fully redeemed for goods for an unlimited period; (4) 10% of the total amount of coupons sold will be donated to the Shen Xin Scholarship Fund.</p>
