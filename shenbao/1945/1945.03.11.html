<p>東京十日中央社電　日帝國政府於十日上午九時召開臨時閣議，以越南之新事態爲基礎，愼重商討，決定根本態度，正午特發表聲明，內容如次：日帝國關於越南之共同防衛問題，根據訂立之公約，始終一貫，與印度支那之法國官憲。軍隊協力防衛該地，邇來由於戰局之轉移，法國官憲之態度逐漸變更，不盡防衛之責，我方代表累次促其反省而無效，以故駐該地之日軍不得已對於目前之敵軍採取獨力防衛措置，排除敵性官憲，聯絡協力者，共同完成其目的。日帝國政府對越南非爲領土之企圖，實爲防止東亞之侵略勢力，對越南居民，不辭各方面之援助，久被彈壓下民族之獨立，基於大東亞共同宣言之宗旨，促其實現。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營十日上午二時發表：日越南駐屯軍，鑒於越南當局不守信義，不能共同防衛印度支那，茲爲一掃敵性勢力，決意單獨防衛該地，而於三月九日夜，開始必要措置。</p>
<h3 id="c2">越南一部軍警　均解除武裝　重要設施已接收完畢 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>西貢十日中央社電　日松本駐越南大使，九日下午七時發表（文同大本營發表從略），又日駐軍三月十日零時發表，關於日·法共同防衛交涉之結果，三月九日接到拒絕答覆，遂開始軍事行動，將抵抗日軍之一部越南軍隊及武裝警官隊解除武裝，並接收若干重要設施。又河內地區至九日深夜，凡越南之營房及其重要設施，俱爲日軍佔領，其主要者爲鐵橋，飛機塲，水道，電氣，印刷所等。</p>
<h3 id="c3">松村德古會談經過 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本駐越南特派大使館及駐屯該地之軍當局，曾與越南採取共同防衛領土之方策，惟近來越南常局態度漸趨冷淡，故日方以正當之手續促其反省。九日松本大使特往訪德古總督，在西貢之總督官邸內作歷史的松本·德古會談，松本大使當就共同防衛越南要案提出日方之最後具體案，與德古總督作長時問之協議，但未獲同意，會談終成僵局，日軍常局遂決意獨自防衛越南。九日深夜斷然採取最低限度之軍事行動，其措置刻已順利進行完畢。</p>
<p>西貢十日中央社電　日松本駐越南大使，九日下午七時赴德古總督官邸訪問，說明日方之要求，下午八時五十分返抵里休街大使官邸，至九時五十分，越南方面聯絡將校來稱，德古總督將親自來回答，然至下午十時十七分，越過回答期限十七分鐘，竟仍遣使者前來答覆，拒絕日方要求，以故日方不得已開始行動。</p>
<h3 id="c4">越南對日失信行爲 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　此次日本對越南當局所採取之非常措置，因不能容忍越南失信行爲。按日軍防衛印度支那，乃依照昭和十六年（民國二十七年）七月二十九日所締結之印度支那防衛協定，日軍常局始終一貫誠意，與越南官憲及軍隊緊密提携，並傾全力防衛該地，然戰局演變，至最近越南當局逐漸轉變態度，表面上與日當局維持友好關係，而實際上却在規避協力，且秘密與敵連繫等情，實有警戒之必要。茲舉越南最近對日本不協力之若干事實如次：（一）越南軍將重要都市駐軍主力布置於都市周圍後，即積極由補給廠運輸彈藥及燃料，準備對日作戰。（二）越南軍逐次增强對菲律賓及駐印。駐渝美空軍與潛水艇，協力策動攻擊越南沿海日艦隊。二月二十日，在河內與越南軍政首腦會談時，其中多數竟敢主張即時對日開戰。（三）駐東京師團長對部下將校稱：日越雙方近將開始決戰。（四）越南軍與駐渝美空軍聯絡，在二月二十日至二十二日間，於河內北方約十公里之泰天接受美機投下物資。（五）在敵機來襲印度支那之際，越南軍不但不加以射擊，反而對日軍擊落之敵機駕駛員亦曾加以優待與庇護，彼等態度之不遜及行動之不合理，不勝枚舉。旣有如上情形，印度支那爲共同防衛，終難繼續，至爲明顯，是以日本曾一再促使越南注意，然終無效，日軍乃決定單獨負責防衛印度支那，同時，在軍事上採取非常之措置。</p>

<h3 id="c6">讀本報社評「中國經濟解救之道」感言 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 王海安</p>
<p>申報社評，對於當前經濟動向及其病態，闡論透切，而深中時弊。讀者閱三月二日所載「中國經濟解救之道」一文，不禁重有感焉，爰申論之。</p>
<p>物競公例，惟適乃存。適者何？順應於外以發育其本能是也。處茲之時，正嬗遞之世，戰時固爲破壞，同時亦爲建設，能順應現實以助長建設者，則日以榮，反是則日以悴。國家之榮悴消長，恒於國計民生決之，故先進國恒競兢焉內策而外應。我國當前經濟，所以謀順應之道，其道曷由？曰惟有適應戰時經濟施策。誠因在戰時種種設施，類多不能由人民自謀，如自謀勢必廢而不舉，即舉矣而利亦不溥，故必有待於經濟當局之督率，以綰其樞焉。</p>
<p>値茲戰時，統制政策誠爲必要的經濟施策，所爲統制，易言之，即放任之相對名辭也。戰時固不能採取放任，而必須統制，但如以統制爲其目的，而以保育民生爲其手段，則當前生產萎縮，物價暴漲之種種病態，或可望其改善。試觀東西各國，在近世紀以來，鑒於國際經濟競爭之日劇，莫不厲行保育政策，以緣富强。且非惟經濟，抑且及於政治，我國民風則向以泱泱大國，匪假外求自詡，而習尙自然，戰時誠須統制，而順應我國民情，則必須藥之以保育民生，乃爲政之最善者。時論所稱對農民宜採穀貴政策，對人民宜採穀賤政策。與夫各報所論高度之統制，固不能適合我國之民情，而統制紊亂，更足阻塞我國經濟之復興，皆爲保育論之彰彰者。政治固建築在民生，民生亦能影響及於政治，政之爲用貴在審時，尤須熟察本國之歷史，及其風俗人情，而謀所以因應之，即所論內策而外應也。</p>
<p>最近新市政設施，已置其重點於國利民福，作治標治本之兼施，與論界亦孜孜於安定民生之不斷呼籲，重重發揮其木格之責任，具徴上下已能相互努力搏成一丸，而共圖挽救當前傾側顚沛之難關。</p>
<p>再就工商言之，本市實業界之畸形繫榮時期，已隨日月而消逝。在現階段固須促進增產，同時亦須籌維如何預防減少外來之損害，以保股東資產之安全，內而職工之福利，人事之處理，以及疏散必要之準備，固爲主其事者艱巨而苦悶之課題。但如在此空休時期，對技術人才之儲備，及加緊培育幹部人員而仍繼續不輟，則經年之耕耘者，或即他日之收穫者歟？戰後本市新設之企業興業建業等公司如林，其能作眞性投資於工廠，商而兼工者固多，但做有母體機構，而無子體組織者，雖共資產負債表，損益計算書，皆蔚然可觀，但時至今日，深信必將轉移眼光，而作務實之企圖。各商號連年承物價猛烈上漲，莫不欣欣而向榮，但目前行莊之緊縮放款，人口之將疏散，交通之欠圓滑，購買力之減弱，已爲必然之趨勢，深望於緊縮業務以外，能運行抑平物價施策。最近各業將普設評價會，在商人本身，固不求削足以適履，但亦不可使當局求苗榮反滋苗枯，而有治絲益棼之感。千業公會聞將重新强化機構，深冀於調整之後，能澈底滲透法令於同業，併各小組爲一業，聯各業爲一堅强而緻密之有力集團，而不爲汚吏所利用。喩夫物質，至稀鬆者爲氣體，一吹盪即散。稍進則爲液體，則控搏由人。更進而爲固體，則顚撲而不破者。社會之進化當亦類是。在民生機隍儳然不知所終之今日，亦利賴焉。</p>
<h3 id="c7">國府决全面協力　對越施同二步驟　停止法方官憲執行職務 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　國民政府聲明：盟邦日本國政府，自與法國簽訂共同防衛法屬越南之議定書以來，始終信守，與法國官應及軍隊協力，盡其防衛越南，保障東亞之責，乃近來法方官憲態度漸變，終無反省之意，日本國遂不得不採取緊急措置，制止其官憲之行動。</p>
<p>國民政府根據中日同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言之精神，對於日本政府之此種必要措置，決予以全面協力，實施同一步驟，停止法方官憲之執行職務，而對於中國境內之法國官民及其權益，則取寬大之措置。越南處東亞前衛，與我國關係甚爲密切，今越南人民能勉力振奮，保衛土地，防止外來侵略，力謀自身及東亞之解放，則國民政府當盡力予以援助。</p>
<h3 id="c8">泰國當局承諾全國協力日軍 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>盤谷十日中央社電　日駐泰山本大使，九日晚與泰首相及外相會見，言及印度支那半島上之新情勢謂：越南新情勢之發生，於日，泰兩國緊密協力親善關係毫無影響，日政府基於日。泰兩國同盟條約，決更將强化兩國間提携關係，同時幷謂，泰政府協力日軍對越南之處置，（一）自越南週入泰領之軍隊。警官等，完全予以解除武裝。（二）居泰法國外交官及僑民，應與居日之法人同樣辦理。（三）今後益應促進越南·泰國之物資交流。上項日方提議，泰首想完全予以承諾，同時，日軍駐泰部隊長亦往訪泰國國防大臣及國防軍總指揮官，要求泰國軍隊對於下述各點予以協力，（一）將泰國及越南國境暫時封鎖。（二）在泰之法國權益，完全交由泰政府處置，日軍不予千涉。泰國國防大臣，泰國軍總司令官對此全部承諾。幷全面協力日軍。</p>

<p>南京十日中央社電　內政部十日下午四時在該部大禮堂接見記者，梅部長因公外出，當由民政司司長蔡秉提代表，蔡氏對該部最近施政槪况，報吿至詳，茲誌大要如次：（一）關於民政事項方面，計有調整行政督察專員制度及分設行政督察區域，召開第一次各省市行政督察專員會議之意義，以及會同社會福利部擬訂國民義務作動法，修正鄕鎭保甲法等。（二）關於警政事項，計有整飭警察人事與風紀，舉辦外事警察調訓班，以及公布戰時外國人居住證旅行證發給暫行辦法。（三）關於地政事項方面，計有督導各省市辦理土地登記，幷整理公有土地，使其合法經濟的使用，以及接管盟邦移交不在業主土地等。</p>

<p>東京十且中央社電　日大本營十日十二時發表如次：十日零時頃至二　時四十分間，敵B29型機約一百三十架空襲東京，盲炸市街各地，以故都內各地發生火災，宮內省主馬寮之火，於二時三十五分撲滅，餘均於八時完全撲滅，目下判明之戰果，計擊落十五架，擊毀約五十架。</p>

<p>— 毅湯</p>
<p>這次在各地攷察的對象，是治安·民生及交通三者，亦即是上海疏散市民最關懷的三樁事。所謂民生，換言之便是物價。現在就蘇州的主要物價略作報吿。</p>
<p>物價　就一般情形言，蘇州物價雖較上海爲廉，但因爲是省會所在地，人口稠密，消耗的多，生產的少，所以物價比附近的幾個縣高，尤其是比無錫高。（三月八日價，單位元）</p>
<p>米（石）　五二　〇〇〇</p>
<p>栗柴（担）　三三〇〇</p>
<p>稻柴（担）　二六〇〇</p>
<p>豆油（斤）　一一〇〇</p>
<p>豬肉（斤）　九〇〇</p>
<p>青菜（斤）　三〇〇</p>
<p>魚（斤）　九六〇</p>
<p>鹽（斤）　三〇〇</p>
<p>麵粉（包）二〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>麵（斤）　四〇〇</p>
<p>蛋（個）　六〇</p>
<p>火柴（匣）　六〇</p>
<p>中高樂香烟（包）三二〇</p>
<p>石庫門屋（三樓三底）</p>
<p>月租　三一二〇〇</p>
<p>就上表而觀，其中房屋的租價，特別貴得驚人，因爲蘇州的屋租以實物計算，三樓三底的石庫門屋，租價的六斗米，以現在的米便計算，竟達三萬餘元。聽說首次租屋時，要付一個月小費，另外約等於月租十分之七八的押租。</p>
<p>治安　記者於三月八日訪問吳縣縣政府，適因沈縣長調任，所以由保甲室的負責人蕭承祖接見。據云：城內治安，非常良好，四鄉因有游擊隊，如新四軍，忠救軍等，所以不很平靖。但如果上海的普通百姓疏散到蘇州鄉間，不致引起什麼間題。</p>
<p>過去滬上傳說蘇州城內駐軍云云，據記者所見，完全不確，蘇州與從前一樣，市民也不因戰事日趨激烈而有任何不安。省當局對於維持市內秩序，不遺餘力，憲兵全日列隊巡查各街，遇有不守紀律之士兵，立予逮捕。七日有我國海軍五人，因在觀前開匯皮鞋店強購皮鞋，業已拘留懲辦，保安隊及警察的紀律，也遠較別地爲好。</p>
<p>交通　目前京滬鐵路每日開行約兩次，時常脫班。無論從滬至吳，或自吳至滬，車票都難購到。往往當時列隊買票的，遠較不列隊而有票的少。不過最近因栗價增高，走單帮都突然減少，擁擠程度，比前稍遜。</p>
<p>從蘇州到附近各縣，有舟楫可通，如到常熟，無錫，以及縣境的洞庭山，角直，木凟，都有定期航船。價格較搭公路車便宜甚多。（三月九日自蘇州發）</p>

<p>南京十日中央社電　將校訓練團成立三周年紀念日，委員長兼該團團長陳代主席爲表示與全體學員學兵同甘共苦起見，特於九日晚偕該團教育長蕭叔宣宿於團內，並於昨晨七時親自率領全體舉行升旗儀式，八時半後，與全體學員學兵同進早餐，至九時召集將校隊學員，分別聽取報吿，並殷殷詢問，訓示頗詳。至十一時許，紀念儀式完畢後，始離校。</p>
<p>訓亂大意　南京十日中央社電　陳兼團長訓詞大意如下：</p>
<p>今天是本團三周年紀念日，同時並舉行將校隊第七期及高級軍官研究班第三期開學典禮，本人藉此機會和諸位談幾句話。本團把將校隊的各位同學，調到中央來受訓的目的是爲什麽？就是使外地的各團長們，對於中央政治軍事的實施情形，得到瞭解，並更進一步受精神訓練。現在還要各位明白的，是政府自還都時到現在，政策一無更變，處今日之環境，此點實具重大意義，並且與中國前途的關係亦甚大。</p>
<p>闡釋國策三大綱要　還都時的政府，國策是「和平反共建國」，要在和平中爭取中國自由，以反共求中國眞正的統一，用建國建設國家鞏固國家的獨立，故和平反共建國，就是爭取自由，要求統一，鞏固獨立，此種政策現在已奠定了相富基礎，希望各位不要膚淺解說，要認淸眞實的現狀。次言中國參戰是自動的，並非是受某一個國家的要求，余爲什麽要參戰呢？百年以來自鴉片戰爭失敗之後，中國處於半殖民地的地位，無論是通商口岸軍事要點，以至於政治等等，悉爲帝國主義所控制，一切都不能自由，所以在大東亞戰爭展開後，乃毅然決然自動參戰。</p>
<p>參戰目的爲求解放　所以中國此交參戰，陳了爲自已以外，尙爲了東亞整個民族。在東亞民族中眞正獨立的是日本，半獨立的是泰國，名義上獨立而實際受多數國家所支配的是中國。東方地方多爲西方之殖民地，所以中國辛亥革命，即爲要求自由之先聲，但辛亥以後，仍爲西方國家所操縱，仍然內亂不息，民國十三年中國國民黨改組，十五年北伐，北伐在表面上是成功了，但實際仍然失敗，因受到國際間英美的牽制。我們要求中國的自由獨立，非但要驅除英美帝國主義，並應驅除一切帝國主義在中國的勢力，否則中國還能像一個完整的國家嗎？是否還能成爲三民主義的國家，那就成爲疑問了。所以爲了國家的自由，中國必需要參戰，戰爭成功，中國才能獨立。目前時局愈益嚴重，但爲了和平建國要求統一獨立的原則，無論時局如何迫切，只要我們堅決努力，中華民國的前途，自然可以達到還都時三大綴要的實現，希望各位勇往邁進。</p>

<h3 id="c21">駐滬法國軍警　昨被解除武裝　日軍採取必要措置圓滿完畢 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>日本駐滬軍當周三月十日下午四時發表稱：「駐滬日軍呼應駐越南日軍對越南法當局之施策，本日解除上海法國軍隊及警察隊之武裝，現已圓滿完舉」。　日駐越軍當局爲擊滅越南當局之通敵謀略，幷爲肅淸東亞之敵性色彩起見，於九日深夜採取必要措置，此間日軍當局呼應此項行動，於昨（十日）晨對本市法國駐軍及警察隊解除其武裝。</p>
<p>並未發生抵抗　據西貢日駐軍發表，該地法國軍警曾有一部份，抵抗日軍，但在上海法國駐軍曁警察隊未有任何抵抗情事發生，且在平靜空氣中進行極爲順利。按本市法國駐軍，在租界未接收前，藉保護法國籍益爲名駐　於揚子江流域各地之法租界內，其中大部均屬安南兵，當國府接收租界後，經改編爲越南軍，全部策中於上海，以便撤往越南。經此次措置後，此等軍隊與警察隊員，當視爲普通法籍市民而受處置，惟鑒於過去彼等之行動，今後絕不准其與他國人發生接觸。</p>
<p>外交折衝停止　除此武裝團體以外之一般法籍居民，被認爲有敵性者外，餘仍堅持日越共同保衛之精神，對於一般協力者，凡其生命財產及限制居住等，採取特別寬容措置。又法國軍隊解除武裝外，在通訊方面亦加限制，惟普通明碼電報仍准使用，由此一點，亦可見日方之寬容。又據預料中日雙方機關，與法國領事事務等之外交折衝，當亦將停止。</p>
<p>舊法租界視察　當日軍解除滬市法國軍武裝並繳收其軍城後，記者即駕車視察舊法租界一週，目睹法眾兵營在日軍保護下，充溢着和平空氣，法國兵仍悠然躺在運動塲草地上，嘴裏吹着口笛，在運動塲側邊堆積大批軍器，看他們的態度已談不到軍紀和軍律，每個兵士的心裏，根本沒有戰爭的一會事，猶如他們的腰間被卸下刺刀一樣。順便走進顧家宅公園，竟找不出一個法國人，在和煦的太陽光下，閒坐着的都是中國人，這種情景，使記者引起了東亞人的東亞，快要來臨的感慨。走出公園，在馬路上有日軍的黄色卡軍，拖曳法軍的戰車，行列好像很長，但不過是老式的戰車吧了。路旁看熱鬧的人，用驚奇眼光來送行，記者踏上　途時，深深感覺到東亞人的東亞，快將來臨了。</p>

<p>上海日軍當局就處置在滬法國軍警，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>「現地日軍已於今（十）晨實施解除汰國駐滬軍警武裝，此次採取此項措置，實深表遺憾，但此亦不得不如此者。</p>
<p>我駐截止軍鹽於目下情勢，曾要求越南當局履行以前所約定之共同防衛協定，然越南方面缺少誠意，拒絕我方要求，故不得已出諸一部份武力行動。</p>
<p>上海之法國駐軍及警察隊，自去歲移交租界後，已喪失其存在基礎，且巳編入越南軍，故爲防止因越南事態，而在上海發生可虞之事態，乃現地軍呼應駐越軍採取今日之措置，對駐滬法軍尤其是法籍居民十深表同情。駐滬法當局認識吾軍眞意，接受要求，得於平靜中進行措置，未曾發生任何糾紛，爲人這上爲維護上海治安，實堪慶賀。軍當局對於抱協力態度之法國方面，並不視作敵人，現在所希望者，爲法駐軍及法籍僑民應認淸日軍　意，切勿輕舉妄動，信仰日軍，安泰以處」。</p>

<p>市宣傳處主辦之和第七次記者例會，循例於昨日下午二時半，在市府會議室舉行，出席各報社記者十餘人，由周社會福利局長出席解答，各報社提出關於該局最近施政諸問題，茲誌其談話如次：</p>
<p>本局施政均乘遵市長指示方針，逐步推進，現擬着手整理本市各公益團體及寺廟，蓋上項慈善團體其所辦理慈善事業頗多，有益民衆福利，惟多因經費缺乏，故不得不向外界呼籲籌募，雖不能按照預算　定，但結果尙足以維持其所辦之慈善事業，慘淡經營，精神殊値欽佩，而一般寺廟，過去往往消耗巨大資金，點綴廟堂，全係爲其本身利益着想，實深遺憾。故本人意見，寺廟如今後能對貧苦民衆舉辦救濟工作，而謀福於人民，則方合其慈悲之原意。他如冬賑會辦理施粥，人口疏散工作，本局亦曾參與其事，關於人口疏散問題，本局早經與各同鄉會一度商討，並擬具計劃，現該項計劃，業經提交人口疏散委員會。至於最近工廠因電力滅少，紛紛緊縮，致失業日多，本局按照勞工法曾向各工廠提出，除本月薪水照發外，另將其本月應得之薪水津貼總數發給三個月，俾失業者得暫時維持生活。目前一般房東藉故加重房客負担，往往發生糾紛，均根據戰時特別租賃法，予以調解。</p>

<p>爲了進一步知道實情，記者就和一位老菜販攀談了起來，他倒態度和藹可視，滔滔不絕如數家珍的談着，在這里我發現了我國農民的撲實。據他說：公定價是並不能做爲標準的，菜類因天時氣候的不同，價格早晚都有很大的差異，有些東西缺少和需要，所以價格超出限價；而另外一些呢？因爲易於腐爛，或到貨踴躍，所以往往又低於限價，對菜蔬，從什末日子到什末日子規定了一定價錢。這是不十分合理的，正因爲如此，所以公定價格當成了一種徒具形式的官樣文章。</p>
<p>菜價下跌　因爲近兩天天氣又轉和暖，菜蔬生畏得很快，而已經拔起的，又易腐爛枯黄，所以價格也大跌特跌，譬如靑榮定價三百八十五元一斤但實際上只要一百八十元；菠菜定價二百二十六元一斤，實際只要一百五十元，黄芽菜定價高到五百零九元一斤，但因市民多數都買不起，價錢徒高無用，黄芽菜由江北或靑島等遠地運來，損失很大，不能再爲久藏，不能像其他米等類東西可待價而沽。所以也不能不貶價出售，現在只好買三百五十元一斤，但還很少有人要；塌棵菜定價雖爲三百八十五元一斤，但實際也只好賣二百多元，韮芽是從杭州由火車運來的，因爲火車有時脫班，價格不免高漲，等火車一到就又馬上跌了下來。至於芋艿定價二百二十六元，現在就非三百無一斤不肯賣，山芋定似一百十三元一斤，但實際上却要賣到一百二十元至一百五十元，這是因爲一部分人常做食糧，需要一多價格就始高了起來。</p>
<p>這老菜販談到末了不禁感慨地說：「菜蔬的黄金時代已經過去，老百姓的購買力也的確太弱了！我們這行也和其他行業一樣到了沒落的時候！」</p>
<p>經濟食堂　中央市塲臨蘇州河有着一幢大厦，道里設有各業公會經紀人的辦公處，那樓梯口紅的藍的大的小的磁牌，數上去何至二三十個，當中新貼着一張「中央經濟食堂」的價目廣吿，記者爲它那低廉的價格吸引着，於是走上了二樓，很容易地就找到了那個食堂。這裏是一間長約六丈寬的四丈的大房間，裏面蔬疏落落地放着七八隻畏桌子，每張上可坐六個人，另外還有五六隻方桌子，桌上淸爽地放着醬油瓶，胡椒瓶等調味具，房間的一角就是廚房，門口有一個帳桌，承該食堂的管理員吿訴，得知這食堂已經辦理五個月了，是由中央市塲當局管理的，因爲有市塲的補助，所以比較外面便宜得多，它的價格是甲飯每盆三百三十元，乙飯每盆二百八十元，辣醬飯每客五百元，鹹泡飯每客三百八十元，湯麵每碗二百九十元，炒麵每盆三百五十元，早上還有有點心賣，饅頭十隻二百二十元，餃子十隻也是二百二十元，中飯的開飯時間是十一時半到二時半，這裏雖是爲市塲職員開辦的，但也很歡迎外面的人去吃，不過要加雜費一成，可是這裏小賬和其他的費用是不收的。昨天本報社會服務部提出了辦公人員的中餐問題，假如時間充裕，不嫌走這不太遠的路的話，正不妨去吃一次看看呢。</p>

<p>一片荒凉　硫黄島的面積，僅二十平方公里，作瓢簞形，大的部分向北。此島與所謂富士火山系的父島。母島等各羣島，性質完全不同。最高處是南端的摺鉢山，拔海一百二十公尺，其餘槪爲五十至一百公尺左右的小丘和平地。此島地面，不是熔岩，而是由此島獨具的火山灰凝固而成的凝灰岩。沙漠地帶佔島的南半部，若有張風，立即變更砂丘和位置，荒涼異常。</p>
<p>翁浜，二根浜在高砂台直下，到西海岸的千島浜止，爲島的最狹部，幅廣不到一公里。此東西兩海岸，爲平坦的沙浜，海波殊爲平靜。自此海浜到摺鉢山和千島原去，非攀登高的五十公尺的斷崖絕璧不可。此島南半部全屬不毛之地，但北部則有村落，熱帶植物蒼鬱繁茂，爲良好的防風林，有黄權，梅檀等貴重木材，林投樹等珍本，並有可可椰子，野椰子，菎麻，能舌蘭及野生等香蕉，樹瓜。</p>
<p>海水如沸　神山海岸，立岩鼻等的沿海一帶，驚濤拍岸，斷崖壁立。溫泉浜海面，海水如沸。在此島上，因少入浴的機會，所以洗澡製成很珍貴的事。</p>
<p>島由海底火山噴火而成，北部的斷崖擬土丹石，到處殘留明顯的海蝕之跡，足見昔時此島係在海面之下，以後才隆起海面。地面的隆起運動，年約一尺，海岸綫年年變化。</p>
<p>此島屬於第四紀的新期火山綫，迄今餘燼未熄，有硫黄孔，噴出大量氣體。在元山附近，只要掘至地下三十公分，旣有百度左右的熱水湧出。且硫黄甚多，附近一帶，一片黄色。地熱原一帶，熱氣蒸騰，地面之熱，足以使人不堪坐臥久竚，因而該處掘井無從得水，一切用水均靠天雨</p>
<p>島上出產　島上可說沒有「土」，祗有凝灰岩和土丹石的細粉，農耕非常困難，食糧因而不能自給自足，僅有高根（高加因的原料）等藥用植物及蔬菜，南瓜，西瓜，檸檬草（化粧水原料），甘　，甘蔗，香蕉，棉花，鳳梨，胡瓜等。米却一粒也沒有。</p>
<p>近海的水產有馬鮫魚。鱈魚等類，大部分供島上消費。家畜有牛。雞若干。島上生物，蛇·蝎是完全沒有的，蚊蟲亦少，瘧蚊則根本沒有。鳥類除麻雀和烏鴉不見踪跡以外，有覺鴑，千島，信天翁等，不但足以娛耳悅目，而且所遺糞矢更是極好的肥田料。（譯自二月二十一日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>紅軍的冬季攻勢開始以來，德國無疑面臨開戰以來最大的危機，德國國民直接暴　於慘烈的戰火中，亦爲前例所無。紅軍的壓力雖則依然沒有減退的模樣，然而各戰區德軍的必死抵抗已經奏功。就全體而論，最初數週中旋風似的不安情形，現已克服。首都柏林爲防萬一紅軍衝破德軍防綫起見，全業市已要塞化，市內各要道均置有障碍物，雖然時受英美空軍的猛炸，但被破壞的交通網均能迅速修復，德國當局的敏捷處置，誠足欽佩。</p>
<p>加緊節約　紅軍冬季攻勢開始以後，德國當局立即强化煤斤節約措置，無論電力、煤氣、汽車等都加節約，後方生活的困苦日益加甚，然在煤斤供給地上西里西亞成爲戰塲的今日，一般市民的難以獲得燃料，實爲不得已的事情。不生火爐的房間本已很冷，再加玻璃窗又因轟炸破碎無遣，所以只好穿着大衣辦事吃飯。這就是柏林今日的光景。</p>
<p>市內報紙，亦大行整理，改爲日出二頁，有不少且已成爲二月三日大空襲的犧牲，所以更縮小版面，改出二頁小型，關於經濟，學監等的消息則已絕跡，所有記載除戰况情報以外，即爲對於三國會談的痛烈評論，近來新聞上更充滿紅軍侵入區內目擊紅軍可怕蠻行的種種記述。</p>
<p>奪戰圖存　一克里米亞會談的德國處理案，無論內容如何，總是英美蘇三國要消滅德國而。在這危機急迫的今日，國民除奮起救亡，自力圖存以外，實無他途！」這樣悲痛的論調，可以在柏林的報上看到，無棧電上聽到。</p>
<p>可是，柏林一般的市民却泰然自若，其態度的鎭定殊足使人詫異。當柏林眞化爲戰塲時，一切將變成怎樣呢？恐怕不到那時不能明白吧。（加籐特派員，譯自二月十六日每日新聞）</p>

<p>上海物價的嚴重性，可說至今日而極，凡屬日用必需品之類，莫不排日騰昻，向高峯競走，嗣後雖然有度稍回，有一度盤旋，可是爲時不久又蠢蠢而動，冉冉上升，此項週斯性的漲風，證以戰爭數年來的經過，可說往復循環，先後如出一轍。結果是物價愈漲愈高，人民則焦頭爛額，除了少數例外，類多典質堡窮，吿貸無門。所謂野有餓莩，民有菜色，確可爲今日一般平民寫照。如不能安定當前物價，便不能維持人民生計。上海新市政當局接事以來，在人民方面，都抱着滿腔熱忱，當局方面亦確抱有決心，努力整頓，諸如嚴禁貪汚，取締勒索，提高待遇，徴求人才，又如籌發平價米，以補戶口配給之不足，明定評價，以求物價的安定，凡此賢明措施，均是値得大書特書的，而按之事實，物價確也曾一度回小和安定過，可是沒有多時，春草蔓生，死灰復燃，最近的物價，又在節節上漲，尤其以米和黄金，跳梁得更爲厲害。物價的週期漲風，仍未能加以根絕。此乃無可否認的事實，不但未能符合當局的苦心，同時也不能滿足人民的　望。不過，物價間題終是民生問題的中心，物價問題嚴重性有增無已，就是民生痛苦未能解除。隊就管見所及，對於如何安定物價，略　一得之愚於后：</p>
<p>（一）爭取人民信仰　任何事業要想辦得好，初非一二領袖所能獨力支撐，必定要獲得全體員工的服從和協力。何况上海市政，在此複雜環境中，辦好更非易事。但市政當局的決心和抱負，已可大白於一般市民，仍因舊有悲勢力，不能銷聲匿跡，竭力從中破壞；一應日用品配給，仍未能按期足量，不數人民需要。物價的上漲，除了週期性之外，與此不無關係。記得周市長說過；「治亂世，用重典。」昔衛　徙木而秦治，武侯懲奸而蜀安。何况今日人慾横流，廉恥道傷，不惜夤　奔競，惟冀善賈多財，不問損害國家，無論有關公益，笑駡由人笑罵，發財我自爲之。此風而在，物價決無安定可能，此風而長，人民決無信仰可言，此乃市政當局所應明　，務應排除萬難，振肅綱紀，對於操縱物價，抬高物價的、不惜置之重典，殺一儆百，旣可表示當局的決心，便可獲得人民的信仰，否則雷聲大，雨點小，空言似乎無補於事實的！</p>
<p>（二）限制幣値效用自私自利，乃是人類的天性，移易風氣，要視當局的猷　。試就第一次世界大戰而言，德國人民追求暴利的事實，不勝枚舉，可是這次大戰，情形就不同了，與其謂爲民性的改善，無寗謂爲統制的得法。戰時物資缺乏，通貨膨脹，乃是無可避免的事實，此不但我國如是，但如德日兩國——因爲對於物資，統制得宜；對於物價，管理嚴密，同時配給制度，健全確立，人民無論貧富，除以所得購買廉價配給物資，以維生計外，所有餘存貨幣；不能再向任何市塲，購進任何物資，是貨幣已與物資絕　，故物價可以安定，而人民手中存款，除以之儲蓋或購買政府公債外，可說別無出路，反之政府的配給制度，應能維持人民的最低生活；即退一步言，亦應做到「不患寡而患不均」的地步，方能獲得人民的信仰與協力，而毫無怨言。可是我國幣値雖低，而效用很大，人民不能獲得大量通貨，便不能維持生活，或盡情享樂。一般民生痛苦的　結在此，一般貪汚盛行的　結亦在此。目前立刻要想推行完善的配給制度，固然有許多困難，再則要想使幣値立刻與物價脫離關係，更可說談何容易，可是無論如何，對於幣値的效用，應該大加限制，諸如高級娛樂塲所的取締，物資統制的改進，黑市價格的消滅，務應逐步促其實現，使得現有通貨，效用減少，而價値增鉅，則對於安定物價，自能收相當的效益！</p>
<p>（三）根絕囤積心理戰時通貨膨脹，物資缺乏，乃係普通狀態。人民或則惟恐物資短少，而先行購進，或則逆測未來情况，而預事囤積，旣可滅輕負担，又得大獲利益，爲個人打算，可說面面俱到。可是天下的乖人，決不止一個，如其大家囤積，物價　然上漲了，就個人說，當然如願以償了，可是因爲物價狂漲，國家發行的通貨，數量必須膨脹，而且往復循環，互爲因果，結果物價的昻騰，與通貨的增發，實行競賽，不但國家財政破產，一般人民山窮水盡，就是從事囤積的，因爲個人購買力的限制，恐怕所得仍　微乎其微，即令大發其財，富可敵國，但是剝削民脂民膏的，所謂悖而入者悖而出，多行不義的，決不會有善果。如鄧通的卒爲餓鬼，石崇的身棄東市，前例不勝枚舉，等到知爲財累，已是遲了晚了，何况政府正可施行種種法令，先行精　調查存款與囤貨情况，或則征收戰時利得稅，或則攤銷公債，或則獎勵　　，使囤積的所得悉爲政府所征發，是則　　之舉，損人而不利已，又何必孳　爲之呢！所望當局能够雷厲風行，嚴格執行，不但國庫可以豐盈，物價可以安定，而且囤積風氣亦可無形的戢止。</p>
<p>（四）疏散過剩人口爲減輕戰時空襲的損害計，都市人口應即從事疏散，各國早有先例，可不具論。上海爲我國惟一工商鉅埠，無論爲策生命的安全計，爲謀生產的持續計，疏散過剩人口，已屬箭在絃上勢所必發。加之從經濟上的觀點，適應當前的環境，調劑物資的盈虛，疏散上海人口，亦有其必要。試就上海的配給制度言，所以難滿人意，市民的五方雜處，物資的供應不足，實爲主因，與其空談不可能的暢通來源，增加生產，倒不如實行疏散人口，減少需要。待到一部份人民疏散後，物資的需要，隨之減少，所有投機囤積之流，因對象減少，而散佈流言，搖惑人心的慣技，將無所復施。再就上海南京兩市而言，南京市物價，所以較爲安定者，人口的多寡不同，不無重大關係，所以如能積極疏散上海人口，則對於安定上海物價，亦有其偉大的功效。</p>
<p>物價的上漲，旣然有其獨立性，亦有其聯繫性，惟其有獨立性，所以能因本身的供需關係（無論人爲的或自然的），而價格發生漲落，復因聯繫性的關係，各項物價的漲落，常能影響到其他物價或受其他物價漲落的影響。上海物價在漲到今日的地步，初非一朝一夕的事，所以要想使他安定，也決非一蹴可幾。可是物資不能統制，配給不能充實，則物價決難有安定的希望。所望市政當局能够不避艱難，不辭勞怨，通盤籌議切實對策，然後以決心平定物價，則物價無論如何猖獗，決可使之就範。</p>
<h3 id="c51">學校平價米的支配問題 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 寒心</p>
<p>市政當局特於黑市米價每石突破十萬元大關的嚴重關頭，以每石三萬七千餘元的平價，將鉅量食米售諸各界，其對本市人民最感威脅的糧食問題，雖然還未能因此獲得整個的解決，但無論如何其安定本市人民生活的力量，則已超過前此所有的一切安定民生的措置，是爲絕對不容諱言的事實。面臨蕭這種事實，我們對眞誠爲市民痛苦謀解脫的市政當局，自不勝感激，不過在另一方面，我們爲一　不肖人員，利用機會，從中舞弊，致使造成「不患寡而患不均」的局面，從而使市政常局赤誠愛民之恩，徒益少數奸滑者流，而多數安份守已者反被排擠出利益圈外，則不能不痛心疾首，試以學校平價米的支配問題而言，其核准數量的多寡之漫無標準，學校申請時所呈報的敎職員工人數的以少報多，學校領得平價米後，敎職員工間的分配數量又各不一致，是皆不容我們緘默的惡劣現象。</p>
<p>茲先以領取第二期學校平價米申請單時之情形而論，該處辦事人員，於百數十請求領取申請單者的恭候之下，至上午十時尙未蒞處辦公，値茲加强戰時體制之時，此種現象殊不應有，此其一。領取申請單時，雖先至者，恒遣該處辦事人員以「業已發究」爲理由而加拒絕，惟對後至而興該處辦事人員相識者，則可隨意領取，且其數量亦不加限制，似此以私人好惡作爲取捨公事的準則的行爲，其有背公正，自不待言，此其二；第二期申請人數增加，遂不得已而有减量辦法的實施，惟實施减量而絕無準標，有第一期核准十二石者，第二期减爲六石，有第一期核准七石者，第二期亦减爲六石者，又有由四石减爲三石者，有由十石减爲七石者，有由二十三石减爲二十一石者，其中究竟何所根據而作如是漫無準標之核准，當不僅有違公允，且不免引起誤會，關此一點，承辦學校平價米者，應將其核准標準公開宣佈，同時，亦應將申請各校之人數及其核准數量公諸報端，以示淸白，此其三。</p>
<p>上述三者，爲經手學校平價米之負責者，應加解釋的；其次，我們應該加以檢舉的，是學校方面運用以少報多的手法，蒙蔽當局以騙取額外數量，其中聞竟有某校僅有一百三十餘學生，而所呈報申請平價米之敎職員工竟達一百大十餘人，至校長將其太太，少爺，外甥，娘男之類盡列爲校內員工以增加其申請量者，則更不勝枚舉；似此現象，雖由一般失德敗行之無恥奸徒的岡顧公益所促成，但負責者不實地調查以揭發其奸詐行爲，亦未嘗不是失策之處。</p>
<p>此外，各學校於領得平價米後，其敎職員工間之分配，亦無一致的辦法，有平均分配者，有以任課時間作分配者，又有以所任職務之重要與否作分配者。這三種辦法當中，自以任課時間之多寡作爲分配標準爲最公允，蓋自當局實施重點配給之消息傳出後，甚多取巧之徒，不惜施盡營鑽之術，里有情願完全義務，每週任課一二小時者，其着眼點幷不在乎區區之敎薪，而在乎各種重點配給物之獵得，故平均配給，則此輩取巧之徒，必盡售其計，而負實際敎學責任者，則由是而受其剝削；至以所任職務之重要與否作爲分配標準者，事實上亦欠公允，蓋校長旣不能因其爲校長之故而食兼人之食，而敎員亦不能因其爲敎員之故而食半人之糧，故據此而作平價米之支配者，雖無利用權位以圖多取數量之嫌。故我們認其最合理之支配標準，爲根據部頒教員每週授課時間爲準則，例如中學敎員每週授課二十節，則凡每週授課已滿二十節之敎員，應得一份，不滿二十節而在十節以上者，得半份，十節以下者得四分之一份。職員之全日駐校者，作一份論。庶幾政府救濟敎育界的實惠，得以平均的以各敎育人員所盡力於教育之多少而多少之。</p>
<p>第二次平價米分發日期不遠，謹以芻　之見提供如上，願有心人共相研究，以求合理辦法的獲得</p>
<h3 id="c52">關於洞庭山疏散區 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>閱前週本刋，見項康元先生之「闢洞庭山爲滬民疏散區議」一文，查以洞庭山爲滬民疏散區，頗稱相宜，但尙有其他問題，文中未曾述及，茲筆之於後，以供硏究。</p>
<p>甲·環境問題：洞庭山環境，東山較西山爲佳；西山房屋稀落，不及東山熱鬧。西山雖產水果，茶葉·魚·蝦·菜蔬，而樹木則不多。洞庭山雖名爲「山」，實則是太湖中之一小島，不過當地有幾座小山，故取名爲「山」。現該地樹木已伐半數，所餘僅若干水果樹，燃料木材暫時尙能敷用，當地尙有少量儲存，但日久須另想辦法。</p>
<p>洞庭山所產糧食不多，因目前租稅繁重，農民日少，故當地糧食全仗他處運入，唯運糧非常人所能爲，太湖中匪船很多，恐難安全運到，唯一辦法，爲由官方押運。</p>
<p>洞庭山若移民，當地物價勢必上漲，八一三時上海及蘇州人民逃至洞庭山時，當地物價漲勞甚烈，此事不可不防。</p>
<p>當地治安目前一無保障，現在居住該地者多半是無業遊民，少有富人居住，主要原因爲綁匪太多，有錢者不敢居住。必須派兵駐紮，並選住民年輕力壯者組織自衛國，以資防守。太湖夙爲匪徒淵藪，故須特別注意，最好派軍隊將其全部肅淸，以期一勞永逸。</p>
<p>乙·移往辦法；筆者主張同時闢洞庭東山及西山爲疏散區，因東山房屋較西山多，空者亦不少，一部份財力不豐者可借屋居東山，以免在西山另搭房屋。財力富者可出資在東西二山空地上搭屋居住</p>
<p>搭屋木材，須預先運去，因當地並無造屋用之木材。在山居住之無業遊民，過去時將祖遺房屋拆　，故一而預運木料，一面嚴禁再拆賣房屋。</p>
<p>自滬至洞庭山，可從陸路至蘇州，再從水路至洞庭山，或直接僱船前往，交通工具及沿途保護，如無適當辦法，疏散恐極困難。</p>
<p>丙，其他問題，敎育方面，洞庭東山尙有較完善之小學，西山只有少數私塾，如移民多後，定要多設學校，好在東山有許多大厦，可設中學或專門學校。其次，當地醫生甚少，移民多後定不數分配，故醫生亦所需要。又當地並無工業，商業亦不發達，在山設立工廠行號，至爲需要。</p>

<p>東綫方面，德蘇軍隊正在奧得河西岸對峙中，蘇軍以波默拉尼亞區之科爾堡，斯達加特·及科斯特林東方之尼芝河北岸等作根據，迄今未有進展。西綫方面，英美聯合軍一部份已衝破齊格菲防綫，其最前部隊已侵入萊茵河沿岸之杜易斯堡·杜塞道夫·科隆·波恩·科不林士等地區，開始渡河作戰，但德軍近日抵抗益烈。</p>

<p>— 侯千里</p>
<p>栢先生突然想到要做點生意。</p>
<p>可是栢太太一開始就不贊成：</p>
<p>『又要做生意了，上次那個股票的虧吃得多大？險些兒連本都撈不回來………」</p>
<p>「情形兩樣，這回………栢先生抗議。</p>
<p>「算了吧！」栢太太攔住他：「我早就說過，我們這種人做生意總做不好的，什麽都沒有。還是安份守已的好，少做發財的夢！」</p>
<p>「可是，太太，」栢先生提出警吿：「你知道我們一個月要用多少？進賬又是多少？——這年頭，誰還想發財？」</p>
<p>於是太太沒有話說了，家是她當的，她怎麼會不知道這些日子來他們收入跟支出相差多大，要查查栢先生在外面四處張羅，他們這一家子還不是早就成了餓死鬼。可是想到做生意，栢太太可總有點寒心，不說別的，單拿上次栢太太賣了僅存的首飾讓栢先生做股票那件事來請，結果還不是弄得焦頭爛額，做了人家的犧性品，這回……</p>
<p>「這回，你又想做什麼呢？」太太關心地問。</p>
<p>「今天局裏他們說，米在這幾天非漲不可，我向過馬路上幾個米販，已經比前兩天貴了點，所以，我打算買一兩石米。將來，將來就脫給本弄堂的人家。」</p>
<p>「本錢又是從哪兒來呢？」太太有點心回意轉，</p>
<p>「我想，」栢先生滿有把握：「一兩石有限得很，十萬元足矣，去跟老陸商量商量，頂多認他一點利息，我算過，一個月之內還本利，可以凈落五六萬。」</p>
<p>「五六萬有什麼用？」太太澆來一盆冷水。</p>
<p>「到底好點，太太！」栢先生說：「總可以救救急，再說，我們這種人做生意，還不是小本小利，想什麽大發展？」</p>
<p>一點不含糊，栢先生對於這件事算得可眞仔細，他打算風下兩石米，一個月後他担保一定可以漲一倍，到鋒頭最我的時候他出手，可以拿着對本對利，利息就算他一角五吧，除去本利，凈落五六萬是不成問題的。</p>
<p>「五六萬有什麽用？」他又想起太太的話。</p>
<p>這倒是眞的，可是如今想不到這些，栢先生以爲要做就得趕快做。</p>
<p>第二天，一下辦公廳，他去找老陸。</p>
<p>「我自己頭寸也兜不轉，實在抱歉，老兄！」那位先生向他拱拱手，表示毫無辦法。</p>
<p>「數目其實是有限的。」栢先生說。</p>
<p>「數目的確是不算多，可是這那天實在手頭緊，要不，我再替你想想法子看，不過怕要認一點利息。」</p>
<p>「沒關係！利息當然要認的，拜託拜託。」</p>
<p>兩天後老陸給他回信，款子只忙到五萬，而利息是兩角。</p>
<p>「好辣手！」栢先生放下電話，恨恨地又向電話機看一下。</p>
<p>辦公室的那些科員辦事員們却都吱吱喳喳地談着加薪的事。</p>
<p>「老栢，你有沒有聽到消息？」有人向他喊：「聽說這個月要多發三斗米——不是配給米，是米貼。」</p>
<p>栢先生搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「沒那麽便宜的事！」第二個人回答；「你曉得今天米價多少？——六萬四！」</p>
<p>栢先生心裏一跳。</p>
<p>「兩石買不成了！」他想：「糟糕！這可眞要趕快，儘十萬買吧。」</p>
<p>「六萬四？」有人在那面接下去：「看吧，這兩天不到十萬我不姓吳！」</p>
<p>那位吳先生可說得眞不錯，米價一天天地跳上去，六萬五，六萬八，七萬二，七萬四……</p>
<p>栢先生的心也跟着一天天地跳，他每天忙着打聽米價，栢太太也整天爲家裏新買的那一石幾斗米擔心思，這幾天儘是下雨，又怕濕掉，將來沒人要。</p>
<p>但眞使她擔心的倒還是家裏本身的米，罐子裏只剩一斗多點了，算起來只够他們一家吃五六天，吃完以後該怎麽辦，外面米價這麽貴。</p>
<p>「我看那一石多米還是自己吃吧。」她向丈夫說。</p>
<p>「你發痴，」栢先生大聲地說：「吃光了拿什麽錢還人家？——家裏的米我想不成大問題，據他們說，這個月有發米貼的希望。兩斗吧，也好吃十來天。」</p>
<p>「如意算盤由你打的。」太太嘰嚕一句。</p>
<p>可是，這年頭，如意算盤，可眞不是容易打的。人們常會發現先前的理想到後來一件也沒實行，早先的全盤計劃等於白費。就如那個辦事員栢先生吧，正如他太太所說，如意算擊打得可眞好。然而，也正如他自巴所說，他們原不是做生意的人。</p>
<p>幾天過去了，局裏的米貼毫無消息，而米價却依然每天在漲上去，漲上去。</p>
<p>「好脫手了。」太太不止一次地說。</p>
<p>「早咧！」柏先生安慰她：「這幾天裏一定看十萬！」</p>
<p>「別貪心不足…」</p>
<p>「看，你又來了。」柏先生有點生氣：「倒說我貪心爲了什麽？」</p>
<p>「可是我們家裏又怎麽辦？」太太只好掉轉話頭。</p>
<p>「只要米出了手，什麽事都好弄。」</p>
<p>然而米還是沒出手。</p>
<p>米價回下來了！</p>
<p>第一天回下兩千，第二天又回一千，第三天…</p>
<p>「怎麽辦？」太太急得心神不定。</p>
<p>「沒關係，還要再回上去的。這是退潮，站不常的，—還得要漲上去。」</p>
<p>可是這回柏先生沒有看準，米價竟然站住了。—也許將來還得再漲上去，但至少這一陣停着沒動。</p>
<p>這可使柏先生心上不安起來，他開始懊悔前幾天沒有趁鋒頭最高的時候脫手了。如今還是揑在手裏，要忍着痛認大利錢，脫手吧，實在又覺得對不住自己，忙了這麽多天。</p>
<p>「我看算了吧，」柏太太又是那一套：「我們做生意總是做不好的，人家做却好，臨到我們做就倒了霉，再不脫手，連本錢都不用想撈回來了。」</p>
<p>「難道就這麽脫手了！」</p>
<p>「不脫手又怎麽辦？」太太這回可有了經騐：「刷鍋等米，我們家裏一向這樣。如今，你還揑住不放，難道再向人偕債來自己買米吃？」</p>
<p>「那麽」，柏先生下了決心：「你明天問問弄堂裏可有人要。」</p>
<p>第二天，柏太太ｇ　淸平就跑到十七號裏去。</p>
<p>「周師母，你們米要不要，我們家裏那個娘姨的男的拿了一石多點來托我問問看。」</p>
<p>「什麼價錢？」</p>
<p>「他說的照市價，—不過，我想總可以再便宜點的。」</p>
<p>「好吧，不過米可要好，」對方說：「柏師母，你知道，這些米販子滑頭事眞多！」</p>
<p>一小時後，銀貨兩訖。</p>
<p>柏先生向人家算淸了本利，餘了的款子正好買了幾斗米。</p>
<p>本來打算去買雙皮鞋的，他到那家店裏一看，六千五的碼子已經改了一萬四千五。</p>
<p>柏太太也原預備等米上的錢拿那件舊大衣翻一下新，現在，當然不去提起。</p>
<p>就這麽着，柏先生結束他這麽一次的生意。</p>
<h3 id="c55">紀念白茅百期　其一 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 胡生權</p>
<p>有許多人都在詛咒着時間，說它是多麽殘酷呵，把一切壯健的化爲衰老，徒然使人在回憶裏惆悵；但是，我要說，把一個脆弱的嬰孩護養成一個壯茁的少年，引起人無限的希望，不也是時間的功績麼？時間的本身是沒有罪的，它是一種公平的記錄，顯出了什麽是退化的，什麼是進步的！</p>
<p>白茅從創刋起到現在，已經出滿百期了。它是退化的，抑是進步的呢？這是一個非常複雜的問題，一個營養不良的孩子是很難希望能十分健康的，現在是什麽時候，容你的歌哭來激動人家的情緒？然而，它還是在崛强地生長着，生長着。無疑地，它的前程是遠大的。</p>
<p>也許有人，把眼睛向着天，讀了一二期白茅後，在鼻子管裏笑出聲來，什麽東西！但是，我要吿訴他，你所笑的，正是白茅頂寳貴的地方。替它經常寫文章的，大多是有熱烈情緒而缺少文字上技巧的靑年。它的生長不是頂寂寞的，每天可以接到許許多多不是「作家」的文章，誇張一些說：它可以稱一聲文藝界中的秧田。</p>
<p>再說，白茅也不是完全沒有成熟的作品，它是有好幾個愛好文藝的靑年在流着汗耕耘着，當他們在別的刋物上侍候得讀者們不耐煩的時候，在白茅裏喊出了眞切的呼聲，這不僅僅是他們的文章，還跳動着他們的良心！</p>
<p>時間是一種公平的記錄，百期以後的白茅，也許有一種新的面目出現在上海的文藝界中，它是退化的抑是進步的，當有許多公正的人們來評定它，我希望愛護白茅的讀者和作者，努力地護養它畏成吧！</p>
<p>其二　陳心</p>
<p>兩年前，白茅將它的第一期擢到我們面前。一百期來，誠如編者在創刋辭裏所說：「我們的白茅，就是希望作成文藝界的白茅：有偉大的精神，不凡的美麗，與人不無小補的功用。」</p>
<p>正像它底名字，白茅是野草，不是名花，它自然不會受看　名花的人的歡迎的。然而，有哪一種家草不是由野草長成的？「春風吹又生」，那些名花能有這般的活力？能經得風吹雨打？</p>
<p>自然，一百期來，也還有些不滿意的地方，也還有些缺點，然而，當我們想到支持這園地的幾乎全是年靑人的時候，對於這些缺點該是可以原諒的，是不是？何况這裏儘也充滿了生氣。</p>
<p>希望總是在於未來，白茅是年靑的，充滿了生氣和活力，我相信，它會很快地成長起來的。</p>

<p>又有什麼可以使我們更適當的來處置這頗爲突然的談話機會？倒不如有一個如此難得的機會，將深陷在心坎的生活的烙印，痛快的洗刷一通，您說您的？我說我的。這種種事後想想，眞亦是無聊，但當時却頗認眞，甚至還在較量着高低，還爭什麼樂觀與悲觀？</p>
<p>烽米瀰漫的年頭，青年的伙侶，不能隨烽火去燃燒靑春的勇氣，結果被拋落在如今這黑沉沉的角落中，受着生活的鞭策，在掙扎，在徬徨，在希望，亦在失望。這樣誰能免得了有滿腹牢騷。</p>
<p>年靑人應該更崛强些，耐得苦，敖得過痛，應該而已，如果已有了如此許多牢騷，而始終强制壓抑在胸中，豈是解決問題的辦法？何况，我們平時亦無從訴苦，儘有滿腹悲鳴，還不是自已忍受。</p>
<p>那末，今天這不期而遇的機會，讓這埋藏在心坎的無限的辛酸，發洩一下，倒亦够痛快。</p>
<p>靑年人的訴苦，倒底與中年人，老年人是不同的。中年人在訴苦中滿藏了狡猾的世故，老年人則已祇是悲憫與嘆惜。</p>
<p>靑年人却是無原則的，祇是發洩而已，待得自已覺悟到訴苦亦無用，一切總得自己來解決，我們有的是手，是腦，是生活下去的勇氣，希望，我們不會被生活磨鍊得枯竭了熱力，我們能够：耐得住苦，熬得過痛！</p>
<p>有這種自信，那末，互相訴苦以後的人們，恢復您靑年的活力，更脚踏實地的去腹平製造這許多創傷的生活途徑上的崎嶇罷。</p>

<h3 id="c60">足球聯賽甲組　聯誼今晨决戰葡商　許隊長談存必勝雄心 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>足球聯賽甲組已在最後繫要階段，今日上午十時在跑馬廳聯誼葡商之戰，無異爲該組之爭覇戰。是則靜安道上之一番車水馬能，盛况可期，際此大戰之日，故對此賽之各方面，加以申述焉。</p>
<p>兩隊戰績以後趨勢</p>
<p>按甲組中除上　兩隊外，僑聯已敗兩次，失四分。東華有三次敗績，失六分，其餘各隊則更多失分，上述者，俱無問鼎中原之希望。唯聯館僅和局二次，葡商敗一塲，兩隊以最佳之情形，榮居前茅，則今戰當爲決戰無疑。如葡商今日獲勝，以後尙有對雞林一役，當可穏取荊州。反之，今日如聯誼吿捷，則有東華雞林二仗，勝雞林可不生問題，而東華自必放一馬，即聯誼可得皇座矣。冠軍問題　於此戰，其重要可知。</p>
<p>雙方實力各有千秋</p>
<p>再硏討雙方實力，先談聯誼，該隊索以守衛特性於球壇。蓋中堅宋鑑聖之淸帶球，爲各隊中少有之人材。而左右前衛畢　福郭英種，亦有良佳之球藝，充沛之氣力，此一欄防綫，可稱鞏固。後衛方面，左方李天生曾出席世運，經騐觀富，雖年事稍長，但徐娘風韻，不讓少艾，沙塲威風，無多　於當年。右方吳祺詳最近有顚峯狀態，其身手獨覇滬上，出脚之快地位之佳，嘆爲觀止。具以氣力復元，益覺發揮無遺，毫無缺點。門將劉顯漢中上之材。致聯誼前鋒，向鮮良好之印象予人，唯本季自小將羅壽福高秀清之來歸，並力圖向上。周麒麟亦有進境。於是聯誼之鋒綫，因而出色矣。以是而言，聯誼便成爲攻守遵優之强旅，葡商在滬上足球史上，具有相當歷史。蓋葡將大都僑居海上，已有年數。故對華隊之戰法，熟稔異常，臨陣頗能出奇制勝，尤爲可貴。該隊全隊有智有謀，有細膩之作風，擅攻人之短處。前綫上以鮑休脫爲連繫之中心人物，而兩翼福恩V蘇若，前者有最高之速度，役者球最爲淸楚，門檻又精。應爲利用此三人，事實上確爲危險人物，葡商之中衛綫當以中堅奧列維拉有出將入相之風度，爲最厲害。右前衛A柯拉沙，勇而無智。左前衛考司坦則多方而無長力未能爲最理想。後衛柯萊脫勝於維克泰。按維克泰雖有悠久之歷史，各方亦頗有贊成此人者，但筆者總覺老而無用，且粗野之至，無儒將氣味，守門播里曼偶有超然之演出，但缺把握耳。綜論雙方實力，各有千秋。</p>
<p>預測勝負難下斷語</p>
<p>有謂聯誼必勝，蓋在福利實中聯誼曾以四對二取勝。在聯費中聯誼能壓倒虎視躭之僑聯，僑聯則曾大勝葡商，且葡商之守衛方面，最忌如李義臣周麒麟之勇猛。此說亦具理由。但有謂葡商前鋒銳利，且善作誘敵之計，詭滑多端，聯誼後防難佳，或難如願阻止，故葡商勝望較厚，此又一說也。聽之，此戰旣有關錦標之得失，被此戮力以赴，均可望盡最大之努力，勝負之分，實難在作賽前評斷。</p>
<p>與許隊長暢談戰術</p>
<p>昨與聯誼隊長許文奎相値，暢談該隊近况及今日之如何佈陣，茲不妨略述之。據云：聯誼此次抱必勝之決心，隊員近日操練甚股，唯劉顯漢新病初愈，不敢自信也。宋靈聖以公務繁冗，無機前來，其餘諸將與許隊長按日試練，各個情形，俱在正常狀態中。致上塲陣容，決爲守門劉顯漢。後衛吳祺詳李天生。中衛綫鄭英權·宋靈聖·瞿永福。前鋒許文奎·高保正·李義臣·羅濤福·周麒麟。其中調動可能者，即羅壽福無高秀淸之近况，屆時視情形而更易。許本人或感體力不支時，將由費春肇補之。再劉兩漢因病體如有不遽，則鄭英種爲守門，而以高保正爲中衛綫。由此可見該隊對於各方面顧慮邇到，殺敵致果，有厚望焉，又許隊長談戰術。渠云：葡商最足慮者爲變翼傳飛及中央突破兩種方式，則我方以瞿永福死釘瞿福恩，而有獎祺詳管住頂蘇若，瞿吳近况彌佳，可有此能力，則葡商插翼難飛，而其中央突破，則正有宋靈主持攔住，勝任有餘。對方攻勢旣缺，即我隊多進攻之機會。以進步頻多之情形中，益以李義臣之大力閣斧，爲葡將不易克制者，故今日各將士如不失常態，當有痛繫胡兒之把握。（必賢）</p>
<h3 id="c61">進呈足聯會一言　對檢查員應加訓練 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 徐志豪</p>
<p>本屆足聯合更迭人員以來，辦事精神，益勝於前，此視壇及各界人士所共睹之事實，無容賛述。唯有一點，頗令筆者認爲不滿意，即該會爲防止觀衆無票擁入之弊，故雇用多數之檢查員在門口嚴加收票，此固爲應有之措置，唯筆者目睹所謂檢查員者，大都爲未受訓締之肇，耀武揚威，有時對有派司或球員證者，加以無謂之非難。反之，如與其有相識之交者，則隨便放入，所見不一，亦爲同道中所共見。據筆者，東華與華通在膠園之一役，與檢查員某少起口舌，彼即率領大批檢查員，似欲與筆者動武者然，且出言不遜，完全未受訓練及未曾受教育者。夫足球賢乃運動也，體育中之一項，則觀衆亦屬有識之士，如一旦爲欣質球藝而受檢查員之侮辱，豈不怨哉。故聊伸鄙意，敢請足聯會當局對此一般檢查員加以嚴格訓練，所以示體育之價値幸當局勿以小節而疏忽，不負筆者之眞意。</p>
<p>値得介紹的　三位女籃健將　（瘦記者）</p>
<p>本屆女子籃球有意外的蓬勃，申報查及第三屆籃　球聯賽，給予觀衆的形象是老將不退步，新人不少。前本刋會載『兩題女子新藝呈』，茲筆者以個人觀察，另有三巾幗，値得一書。不揣文抽，以實本刋，亦所以鼓勵女將。且聞大華體育會近有舉辦一女子聯賽，更望市巾幗英雄，再接再勵，使水準再提高，則幸甚矣。</p>
<p>聶寶珠</p>
<p>聶寶珠是雪白隊裏後衛的台柱，是民立女中的高材生。溯雪白第一戰逢緣時，聶小姐不因强敵當前，而消現胆怯者。左擋攔，緣隊諸將，亦爲之側目，　優點，獲籃不球的站立地地位極佳。所以雖然沒有最好的彈性，還是什得其九。更可貴者，聶小姐始終能認眞作戰，不以勝負所有影響。因此她逐塲有進步的演出，再努力以往，聶小姐可與號稱全滬最佳後衛，與王維珍小姐嫓美，勉之哉！</p>
<p>伍美矣</p>
<p>益康隊是新興隊伍，但是戰績相當可觀。伍小姐就是該隊的隊長，任左衛一職，功夫老練，不輸於一般老將。記者　淸楚，在該隊與緣隊第二循環中之一役，她負職看守黃明媛小姐，在上半時中發揮其本能，使益康失分不多，惜下半時以身體關係，未能續戰，遂又見黃小姐之縱橫，於此亦足證伍之球藝確屬不。伍之可取爲身體活潑，奔跑迅速，避人玲瓏，傳球準確。具此幾項籃球員基本的條件，前途未可限量。</p>
<p>嚴蔚雯</p>
<p>六七年前的事，啓秀女子籃球隊揚威球壇，嚴小姐已是該隊優良的前鋒。不過那時她，以年稚尙輕，短短的一個，較少精彩，嗣後以女子籃球少活動，便無從見市幗身手。迨至最近復興，嚴小姐東山再起，加入緣　，乃以其身材隨年齡而發在，一變而爲標準中鋒的身段。她的球藝，並不以久疏而生，益覺較前出色。緣隊前鋒之格外動人，俱賴嚴中鋒之策揮中，她對於擔球運球，極有腦筋。中距離投籃之準確，資勢之閂觀，全滬女子籃球中鋒人才，堪稱無匹。而作戰時，始終有和氣之態度，甜笑掛臉，運動員値得模楷者。</p>
<h3 id="c62">籃球學理述要（十四） <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>（三）虛裝　虛襲是一種隧觀對方之素枝術，使一時不易獲知進攻目標。此種虛裝動作，可以用手，用脚，用身體，眼目，口舌等動作爲之。可單獨或混合而行，可隨合人之聽明與經騐而異，但必須演出大方純正。通常用得最多者，在於擲出界球，爲對近時。或遇適近身防守時，或當使球而爲敵監守時，或拍球後投籃，遇敵在前時，或接球後，敵人走近防守之時行之。總然之虛裝雖可隨時應用，但不可常用一種，並且須有運用之天方，方能奏效，否則必致屬多筆之動作。</p>
<p>（四）阻擋　阻擋方法，即是說非持球之同伴，用各種不侵犯對方之方法，擋住對方防守路綫，以便持球之同伴，獲得進攻機會。例如甲傳球與乙之後，隨即走前將看守着乙之敵人擋住，使得乙可從甲後拍球前進投籃。此種方法，在前塲進攻時，用得最多，尤其是在雙方密集之時。凡經高級訓練之球隊，無不用相當長之時間，受此種技術訓練。近代籃球法，多採取五人聯防，及人釘人之戰略，前者密集在敵方塲佈陣，後者無時無刻，不釘緊着對方，欲攻破此二防守戰略，以全隊進攻，採用阻擋法，最爲有效。查滬上球隊似不慣用此種戰術，常見球員傳球之後，祇顧覓路而跑，不知立將就近之敵人擋住，以便同伴帶球進攻。倘使跑開，無形中讓路與敵人走前，截搶同伴之球，可見不知應用阻擋法也，實有加以特別硏究與訓練之必要。</p>
<p>三·個人防守基本技術</p>
<p>現代籃球運動，自中圈跳球滅蹟以後，因各種新戰法，多採用速攻速守，尤其是速守。故每一球員均須加速其攻守個人技術。現代球隊能善攻善守者，方能制人。否則必制於人，其理甚明也。其實籃球戰法，善攻不如善守。蓋遇兩强相遇，進攻實力相同時，制勝之關鍵必縣於防守技術。因善守者，必獲球進攻機會較多之故也。惟多數球員，每勇於攻，而忽於守。常見球員在練習時，用百份之九十九時間，硏究進攻方法，對於防守技術，則不遇偶一爲之，此誠大謬也。夫敵弱吾强，固可恃優勢之進攻技術，向敵長驅直入。倘敵强而吾弱，必致進不能克，退不能守，安有不敗之理。是故攻防之術，必以嚴防爲光，其次始及於進攻也。</p>
<p>（一）防守暗示</p>
<p>凡善於守之球員，其守敵所站之位置，必能常佔得上風。據守內圈，站在敵與籃之中間，使球與人，均可同時兼顧，避免敵行阻擋法進攻時，所發生之不利形勢，同時亦可居中欄　敵之使球，尤其在「人釘人」之防守法。倘球興人，均能同時被看守，此時首要者，爲看守着人而不是球，若祗顧看球，而不看人，偶一不滇，必被敵用裝虛·阻擋·或旋轉之法而達脫。故個人防守技術。必先明其所站位置之重要，其次始可言及其他防守法也。</p>
<p>（二）正確防守法</p>
<p>正確之防守法，其站立之姿勢，甚爲重要。兩足應左右分立，兩膝稍幣曲，身體略向前傾，兩譬宜張開，而以一手橫舉，攔阻對方去路。一手在敵面前高舉，不斷攏動，裝兇作勢，以擾亂對方視綫，使之心慌意亂，不易投籃與傳球，或在慌亂中，將球失落，俾可奪得之。但此種站立姿勢，須常保持身體重心平衡，不失却自己之管制力。站立位置，不宜離敵太近，太近則易觸及身體而犯規。即敵人之動向，亦難以窺察，且易爲對方用裝虛之法，亂我視綫。或用繫地傳球，半球傳出，或用旋轉閃避法，在身邊逃脫。但又不能離敵太遠，太遠則失却防守效力，應站在離敵約一碼遠，可伸手及於對方持在胸部之球爲度。看守敵人之法，非至敵衝前時，不易離開位置。非至敵已出手投籃時，不易跳起搶球。倘敵持球在手，開始衝前，則應先退後，確定其傳球或拍球之路綫，然後上前截搶。倘敵無球在手而衝前，則可跟隨其跑，搶佔內關。且跑且壓迫其近於邊綫，或使之困於塲角，使其所走路綫較長，所能活動之塲地較少，決不讓其走入內圈，佔得離籃比我較近之塲地。此不過概而言之，尙須參考不列其他防守法，兼而運用，方能適應各種防守之形勢也。</p>
<p>（三）在對方投籃後之防守法</p>
<p>在對方投籃後，防守之法，每一防守隊員，應嚴防其本人所防之敵，幷須搶在敵前，估得近籃之內團，將敵開離在關外，使敵不易跟踪再行投鑒。即使敵可再行進攻，亦須　過吾方隊員而跑，不易近籃投入。故在敵投籃時，不宜注視球之路綫，而應監視敵人，看準其脚路，以便判斷其行動，預爲防守。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Government Issues Statement on Vietnam: Adopting Independent Defense Measures, General Headquarters Announces Vietnamese Breach of Faith <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Government convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting at 9:00 AM on the 10th, carefully discussing the fundamental stance based on the new situation in Vietnam. At noon, a statement was issued with the following content: Regarding the issue of joint defense in Vietnam, the Japanese Empire has consistently, based on established conventions, cooperated with French officials and troops in Indochina to defend the area. Recently, due to shifts in the war situation, the attitude of French officials has gradually changed, failing to fulfill their defense responsibilities. Our representatives have repeatedly urged them to reconsider without effect. Therefore, the Japanese forces stationed there have been compelled to take independent defense measures against the current enemy forces, eliminate hostile officials, and coordinate with cooperative individuals to jointly achieve their objective. The Japanese Imperial Government has no territorial ambitions in Vietnam; its sole purpose is to prevent the forces of aggression in East Asia. It will provide assistance to the Vietnamese people in all aspects, promoting the realization of the independence of a nation long suppressed, based on the principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 AM on the 10th: The Japanese garrison in Vietnam, in view of the Vietnamese authorities' breach of faith and inability to jointly defend Indochina, has decided to independently defend the area to sweep away hostile forces, and began necessary measures on the night of March 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e2">A Portion of Vietnamese Troops and Police Disarmed, Key Facilities Completely Taken Over <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Saigon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Matsumoto, announced at 7:00 PM on the 9th (content similar to General Headquarters' announcement omitted). Furthermore, the Japanese garrison announced at 0:00 AM on March 10th that, as a result of negotiations on the joint Japanese-French defense, a rejection was received on March 9th, and military operations were initiated, disarming a portion of the Vietnamese troops and armed police who resisted the Japanese army, and taking over several important facilities. Moreover, in the Hanoi area, by late night on the 9th, all Vietnamese barracks and key facilities were occupied by Japanese troops, with the main ones being iron bridges, airfields, waterworks, electricity, and printing presses.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Course of Matsumoto-Decoux Talks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Special Envoy Embassy in Vietnam and the military authorities stationed there had adopted a policy of jointly defending the territory with Vietnam. However, recently, the attitude of the Vietnamese government has become increasingly lukewarm, so the Japanese side used legitimate procedures to urge them to reconsider. On the 9th, Ambassador Matsumoto paid a special visit to Governor-General Decoux, holding a historic Matsumoto-Decoux meeting at the Governor-General's residence in Saigon. Ambassador Matsumoto presented the Japanese side's final concrete proposal on the key issue of joint defense of Vietnam, engaging in lengthy consultations with Governor-General Decoux. However, no agreement was reached, and the talks ended in a deadlock. The Japanese military authorities then decided to independently defend Vietnam. Late on the night of the 9th, they decisively took minimal military action, and the measures have been successfully completed.</p>
<p>Saigon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Matsumoto, visited Governor-General Decoux's residence at 7:00 PM on the 9th, explaining the Japanese demands. He returned to the ambassadorial residence on Rue Catinat at 8:50 PM. At 9:50 PM, a Vietnamese liaison officer came to say that Governor-General Decoux would personally come to respond. However, even though seventeen minutes past the 10:00 PM deadline, an envoy was still sent to deliver a reply, rejecting the Japanese demands, so the Japanese side was forced to begin operations.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Vietnam's Acts of Bad Faith Towards Japan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The extraordinary measures taken by Japan against the Vietnamese authorities this time were due to the inability to tolerate Vietnam's acts of bad faith. The Japanese army's defense of Indochina was based on the Indochina Defense Agreement concluded on July 29th, Showa 16 (1941), and the Japanese military authorities had consistently and sincerely cooperated closely with Vietnamese officials and troops, devoting all their efforts to defending the area. However, as the war situation evolved, the Vietnamese authorities gradually changed their attitude, maintaining friendly relations with the Japanese authorities on the surface while actually evading cooperation and secretly liaising with the enemy, which necessitated vigilance. Several instances of Vietnam's recent lack of cooperation with Japan are listed below: (1) After Vietnamese troops deployed the main force of garrison troops in important cities around the cities, they actively transported ammunition and fuel from supply depots, preparing for war against Japan. (2) Vietnamese troops gradually increased their cooperation with the US Air Force stationed in the Philippines, India, and Chongqing, plotting to attack the Japanese fleet off the coast of Vietnam. During a meeting in Hanoi on February 20th with Vietnamese military and political leaders, many dared to advocate for immediate war against Japan. (3) The commander of the division stationed in Tokyo told his subordinate officers that Japan and Vietnam were about to begin a decisive battle. (4) Vietnamese troops, in contact with the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, accepted supplies dropped by US planes in Thai Nguyen, about ten kilometers north of Hanoi, between February 20th and 22nd. (5) When enemy planes attacked Indochina, Vietnamese troops not only did not fire at them, but also treated with favor and sheltered pilots of enemy planes shot down by the Japanese army. Their disrespectful attitude and unreasonable actions are too numerous to mention. Given the above circumstances, it is clear that joint defense of Indochina could not continue. Therefore, Japan repeatedly urged Vietnam to pay attention, but to no avail. The Japanese army then decided to independently take responsibility for the defense of Indochina, while at the same time taking extraordinary military measures.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Vietnam Forms New Political Party <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Hanoi, 10th (Central News Agency) – Various independent groups in Tonkin, Vietnam, previously gathered comrades to work towards the liberation of Indochina. Recently, representatives from various factions held a joint meeting in Hanoi, and after mutual consultation, decided to unite the various groups to form a single political party with the aim of Indochina's independence and cooperation with Japan, to be called the "Greater Vietnam National Alliance." The alliance is composed of twelve executive committee members and twelve advisory committee members.</p>

<p>— Wang Haian</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* editorial articulates the current economic trends and their ills with penetrating clarity, deeply hitting the crux of the matter. Reading the article "The Way to Save the Chinese Economy" published on March 2nd, I cannot help but feel deeply moved and offer my own thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>It is a universal principle of competition that only the fittest survive. What is fitness? It is conforming to the external environment to develop one's inherent abilities. We are now in a time of transition, a world of flux. Wartime inevitably brings destruction but also creation. Those who can adapt to reality and contribute to construction will prosper day by day, while those who do the opposite will wither. The rise and fall of a nation are determined by its national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, advanced nations constantly strive internally for strategies and externally for responses. What is the way to conform to the current economic situation in our country? It is to implement wartime economic policies. Indeed, many wartime measures cannot be independently planned by the people. If they were to plan independently, they would inevitably be abandoned. Even if they were implemented, the benefits would not be widespread. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the guidance of economic authorities to manage the overall situation.</p>
<p>In these wartime times, control policies are indeed a necessary economic measure. Control, in simpler terms, is the opposite of laissez-faire. Wartime cannot adopt a laissez-faire approach; control is essential. However, if control is the objective and safeguarding the people's livelihood is the means, then the current ailments of shrinking production and soaring prices may be improved. Looking at various countries in the East and West in recent centuries, they have all vigorously implemented conservation policies in light of the increasing international economic competition, in order to become wealthy and powerful. And this applies not only to the economy but also to politics. The Chinese have traditionally prided themselves on being a great nation that does not seek external help, and they are accustomed to nature's course. Wartime certainly requires control, but in accordance with the sentiments of the Chinese people, it is necessary to prescribe conservation of the people's livelihood as the best policy. The prevailing opinion is that a policy of high grain prices should be adopted for farmers, while a policy of low grain prices should be adopted for the people. And the high degree of control discussed in various newspapers cannot be suitable for the sentiments of our people, and chaotic control can further obstruct the revitalization of our economy. These are all clear manifestations of the argument for conservation. Politics is built on the people's livelihood, and the people's livelihood can also affect politics. The use of politics lies in assessing the times, and it is especially important to carefully examine the history of one's own country, as well as its customs and human nature, in order to devise ways to respond to them, which is what is meant by internal strategies and external responses.</p>
<p>Recently, new municipal facilities have placed their emphasis on national interests and the people's welfare, implementing both short-term and long-term measures. The opinion circles are also diligently and incessantly calling for the stabilization of the people's livelihood, fully demonstrating their responsibility. This shows that those above and those below are already able to work together to form a cohesive force and jointly try to overcome the current difficult situation of upheaval.</p>
<p>Regarding industry and commerce, the period of abnormal prosperity for the business community in this city has faded with time. At this stage, it is necessary to promote increased production while also planning how to prevent and reduce external damage in order to protect the security of shareholders' assets. Internal issues such as the welfare of employees, personnel management, and preparations for necessary evacuation are indeed arduous and vexing tasks for those in charge. However, if during this period of dormancy, they continue to relentlessly reserve technical talents and intensify the cultivation of key personnel, then those who have cultivated for years may be the ones who harvest in the future. After the war, companies such as the newly established Enterprise Development Company and Business Construction Company sprung up like forests in this city. Many of them made genuine investments in factories and combined commerce with industry. However, for those who have a parent organization but no subsidiary organization, even though their balance sheets and profit and loss statements are impressive, it is believed that they will inevitably shift their focus and make practical attempts. Over the years, various businesses have been pleased and prospered due to the sharp rise in prices. However, the current trend of banks tightening lending, the impending evacuation of the population, the lack of smooth transportation, and the weakening of purchasing power are inevitable. It is hoped that in addition to tightening operations, they can implement policies to suppress and stabilize prices. Recently, various industries are about to universally establish price assessment committees. Merchants themselves do not seek to cut their feet to fit the shoes, but they must not allow the authorities to seek prosperity only to cause the seedlings to wither, resulting in a sense of solving problems that only makes them more complicated. It is heard that the General Chamber of Commerce will strengthen its organization again. It is hoped that after the adjustment, it can thoroughly disseminate laws and regulations to the industry, merge each small group into one industry, and unite each industry into a strong and close-knit powerful group that is not exploited by corrupt officials. In terms of matter, the most sparse is gas, which scatters with a single blow. A little further is liquid, which can be controlled by people. Further still is solid, which can withstand toppling without breaking. The evolution of society is also similar. In today's world where the people's livelihood is precarious and uncertain, it is also reliant on this.</p>
<h3 id="e7">National Government Decides to Fully Cooperate, Implementing Identical Steps Towards Vietnam, Halting French Officials from Performing Duties <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The National Government declared: Since the Allied Government of Japan signed the agreement on joint defense of French-held Vietnam with France, it has always kept its promise, cooperating with French officials and troops to fulfill its responsibility of defending Vietnam and safeguarding East Asia. However, in recent times, the attitude of French officials has gradually changed, ultimately refusing to reconsider. The Government of Japan has had no choice but to take emergency measures to stop the actions of its officials.</p>
<p>Based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the National Government has decided to fully cooperate with this necessary measure taken by the Japanese Government, implementing identical steps, halting French officials from performing their duties, while adopting lenient measures towards French officials, civilians, and their rights and interests within China. Vietnam is at the forefront of East Asia and has a very close relationship with our country. Now that the Vietnamese people can strive to invigorate themselves, defend their land, prevent external aggression, and strive for their own liberation and that of East Asia, the National Government should do its best to provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Thai Authorities Pledge Full National Cooperation with Japanese Forces <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Yamamoto, met with the Thai Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on the evening of the 9th, mentioning the new situation on the Indochinese Peninsula, saying: The occurrence of the new situation in Vietnam has no impact whatsoever on the close cooperative and friendly relations between Japan and Thailand. Based on the Japanese-Thai Alliance Treaty, the Japanese government has decided to further strengthen the cooperative relationship between the two countries. At the same time, he also stated that the Thai government should cooperate with the Japanese army in its handling of Vietnam by: (1) Completely disarming any troops and police entering Thai territory from Vietnam. (2) Treating French diplomats and residents in Thailand in the same way as French people residing in Japan. (3) Further promoting the exchange of goods between Vietnam and Thailand in the future. The Thai Prime Minister fully promised to accept the above Japanese proposal. At the same time, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Thailand also visited the Thai Minister of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, requesting that the Thai army cooperate on the following points: (1) Temporarily sealing off the borders between Thailand and Vietnam. (2) Entrusting the Thai government with the complete disposal of French interests in Thailand, with the Japanese army not interfering. The Thai Minister of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Army fully promised to accept all of this and fully cooperate with the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced the following at 12:00 PM on the 10th: Between approximately 0:00 AM and 2:40 AM on the 10th, about 130 enemy B-29 aircraft raided Tokyo, indiscriminately bombing various parts of the city, causing fires in various parts of the capital. The fire at the Imperial Household Agency's Main Horse Office was extinguished at 2:35 AM, and the rest were completely extinguished by 8:00 AM. The currently known results of the battle are that 15 aircraft were shot down and about 50 were destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 130 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands invaded Tokyo airspace on the night of the 9th, dropping incendiary bombs, causing damage to the Imperial Household Agency's Main Horse Office, residential areas, and civilian houses. The enemy aircraft flew low to conduct the raids. After being intercepted by the Japanese defense forces, about 65 aircraft were shot down and destroyed. Two of the aircraft shot down caught fire over the center of Tokyo and disintegrated in the air.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – A US Air Force B-29 bomber squadron raided Tokyo on the late night of the 9th, carrying out the first large-scale night bombing of Tokyo. That night, approximately one hundred enemy aircraft successively invaded the Kanto region from the southern sea, and most of them dropped incendiary bombs on Tokyo. Due to the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing, fires broke out in several places in the city, but they were all extinguished by dawn.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – Reuters quoted a Washington dispatch: The United States has recently built a new type of tank, named "General Pershing." US Army official Patterson said that this is the strongest tank built by the United States, equipped with a 90mm cannon.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Current Situation of People's Livelihood in Suzhou - Part Three of the Investigation Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Tang</p>
<p>The subjects of this investigation in various places are security, people's livelihood, and transportation, which are the three things that evacuated citizens from Shanghai are most concerned about. People's livelihood, in other words, is commodity prices. Now, let me give a brief report on the main commodity prices in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices - Generally speaking, commodity prices in Suzhou are lower than in Shanghai, but because it is the location of the provincial capital, with a dense population, high consumption, and low production, commodity prices are higher than in the nearby counties, especially Wuxi. (Prices on March 8th, unit: yuan)</p>
<p>Rice (stone) 52,000</p>
<p>Chestnut firewood (dan) 3,300</p>
<p>Rice straw (dan) 2,600</p>
<p>Soybean oil (jin) 1,100</p>
<p>Pork (jin) 900</p>
<p>Vegetables (jin) 300</p>
<p>Fish (jin) 960</p>
<p>Salt (jin) 300</p>
<p>Flour (bag) 200,000</p>
<p>Noodles (jin) 400</p>
<p>Egg (each) 60</p>
<p>Matches (box) 60</p>
<p>Zhonggaole cigarettes (pack) 320</p>
<p>Shikumen house (three stories)</p>
<p>Monthly rent 31,200</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, the rent for houses is particularly expensive, because the rent for houses in Suzhou is calculated in kind. The rent for a three-story shikumen house is six dou of rice, which, calculated at the current price of rice, amounts to more than 30,000 yuan. It is said that when renting a house for the first time, you have to pay a month's gratuity, plus a deposit of about 70% to 80% of the monthly rent.</p>
<p>Security - The reporter visited the Wu County Government on March 8th. Because Magistrate Shen was transferred, the person in charge of the Baojia Office, Xiao Chengzong, received me. According to him, the security in the city is very good, but the four townships are not very peaceful due to the presence of guerrillas such as the New Fourth Army and the National Salvation Army. However, if ordinary people from Shanghai evacuate to the countryside of Suzhou, it will not cause any problems.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai rumors said that troops were stationed in Suzhou City. According to what the reporter saw, this is completely untrue. Suzhou is the same as before, and the citizens do not feel any unease due to the increasingly fierce war. The provincial authorities are making every effort to maintain order in the city, and military police patrol the streets in formation all day long. Any soldiers who do not obey discipline are immediately arrested. On the 7th, five members of our navy were arrested and punished for forcibly purchasing leather shoes at a Huikai leather shoe store in Guanqian. The discipline of the security team and the police is also much better than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Transportation - The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway currently operates about twice a day, and trains are often delayed. Whether traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou or from Suzhou to Shanghai, tickets are difficult to purchase. Often, those who line up to buy tickets are far fewer than those who do not line up but have tickets. However, recently, due to the increase in chestnut prices, porters have suddenly decreased, and the crowding has lessened slightly.</p>
<p>There are boats to various counties near Suzhou, such as Changshu, Wuxi, and Dongting Mountain, Jiaozhi, and Mudu in the county, and there are regular boats. The prices are much cheaper than taking a highway bus. (Sent from Suzhou on March 9th)</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – On the third anniversary of the founding of the Generals' and Officers' Training Corps, Chairman Chen, who also serves as the corps commander, stayed overnight in the corps with Education Director Xiao Shuxuan on the evening of the 9th to show his solidarity with all the students and soldiers. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he personally led everyone in a flag-raising ceremony. After breakfast with all the students and soldiers at 8:30 AM, he convened a meeting with the students of the Generals' and Officers' Team at 9:00 AM to listen to reports and ask questions in detail, providing thorough instructions. He left the school after the commemorative ceremony concluded at approximately 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Instructions: General Outline</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The general outline of Commander Chen's instructions is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the third anniversary of the founding of this corps, and we are also holding the opening ceremony for the seventh class of the Generals' and Officers' Team and the third class of the Advanced Military Officers' Study Group. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to everyone. What is the purpose of this corps bringing all of you commanders from various regions to the central government for training? It is to allow commanders from various regions to understand the implementation of central political and military policies and to receive further spiritual training. What I want everyone to understand is that the government's policies have remained unchanged since the return to the capital. This is of great significance in today's environment and has a great relationship with China's future.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Three Major Guidelines of National Policy</p>
<p>When the government returned to the capital, the national policies were "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction." We must strive for China's freedom in peace, seek China's true unification through anti-communism, and consolidate China's independence through national reconstruction. Therefore, peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction are about striving for freedom, demanding unification, and consolidating independence. This policy has now laid a considerable foundation, and I hope everyone will not interpret it superficially but recognize the true situation. Secondly, China's participation in the war is voluntary, not at the request of any particular country. Why did I want to participate in the war? Since the defeat in the Opium War a hundred years ago, China has been in a semi-colonial status. Whether it was in commercial ports, military strongholds, or even politics, everything was controlled by imperialism, and nothing was free. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we resolutely and voluntarily participated in the war.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Joining the War is to Seek Liberation</p>
<p>Therefore, China's participation in this war is not only for itself but also for the entire East Asian people. Among the East Asian nations, Japan is truly independent, Thailand is semi-independent, and China is nominally independent but actually controlled by many countries. Many places in the East are Western colonies. Therefore, China's Xinhai Revolution was the precursor to demanding freedom. However, after the Xinhai Revolution, it was still manipulated by Western countries, and internal strife continued. The Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, and the Northern Expedition was launched in 1926. The Northern Expedition was superficially successful, but in reality, it still failed because it was constrained by the United Kingdom and the United States. We want China's freedom and independence, and we must not only drive out British and American imperialism but also drive out all imperialist forces in China. Otherwise, can China still be a complete country? Can it still become a country of the Three Principles of the People? That becomes a question. Therefore, for the sake of national freedom, China must participate in the war. If the war is successful, China can be independent. The current situation is becoming increasingly serious, but for the sake of peace, national reconstruction, the demand for unification, and the principle of independence, no matter how urgent the situation is, as long as we are resolute and work hard, the future of the Republic of China can naturally achieve the realization of the three major principles at the time of the return to the capital. I hope everyone will move forward courageously.</p>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – After inspecting the front lines and returning to Berlin, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had lunch with the envoys of various countries in Berlin, including allied and neutral countries, as well as foreign journalists, and made the following statement: Germany is determined to complete this war with all its strength. The current war situation is slightly unfavorable, and recently there have been speculations about the German government attempting to resolve this situation through political means. This is a misjudgment. The only thing that can prevent the red tide in Europe is the struggle of the German people. If the fighting strength of the German army collapses, then the influence of the red tide will spread without end. It is also a great misconception to say that the Soviet troops entering Germany are extremely disciplined.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: In the past few days, the Western Front has focused on the German bridgeheads on the Rhine River. The American army has only completed its crossing strategy at one point on the east bank of the Rhine. The other efforts are between Bonn and Koblenz. This American attempt to advance south from the east bank of the Rhine was blocked by the German army outside the city of Linz. At the same time, near Wesel, the German army broke the Canadian army's attempt to encircle the German bridgehead. The most difficult battle on the northern part of the Western Front is currently unfolding in the Santen area, where the British army is advancing towards the western suburbs of the city, with flame-throwing tanks as the vanguard. However, the German army is holding firm, making it difficult to succeed. Fierce street fighting is now taking place in Santen. In the Bonn area, the American army is advancing towards the western part of the city and has been quite successful. Street fighting is underway. Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: Another American army has joined the fighting on the Western Front. Details are not yet known.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The 10th is Japanese Army Day. Bao, the Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a special broadcast on the evening of that day. He first explained the significance of Japanese Army Day. During the Russo-Japanese War, Imperial Russia was known for its abundant resources and military strength. Although Japan had undergone the Meiji Restoration, its strength was still far behind. However, the Japanese people, from top to bottom, upheld the spirit of loyalty to the Emperor and were determined to die to win. In the end, they defeated Imperial Russia and established a brilliant war record in the history of East Asian warfare. He then said that the Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage. He firmly believes that Japan not only has the belief in victory but also the determination to die to win, as it did during the Russo-Japanese War. Other allied nations also have the same belief in defeating the United States and Britain and will unleash unlimited fighting power. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War will surely be won in the near future. Finally, he said that in commemorating Japanese Army Day, he hopes that the people will strengthen their belief in victory and complete the war as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e21">French Military Police Stationed in Shanghai Were Disarmed Yesterday; Japanese Army Takes Necessary Measures to Complete Satisfactorily <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Shanghai announced at 4:00 PM on Wednesday, March 10th: "In response to the measures taken by the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam against the Vietnamese French authorities, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai disarmed the French troops and police in Shanghai today, which has now been successfully completed." In order to eliminate the enemy's conspiracies with the Vietnamese authorities and to eliminate the hostile colors in East Asia, the Japanese army stationed in Vietnam took necessary measures late at night on the 9th. In response to this action, the Japanese army stationed here disarmed the French troops and police in this city yesterday morning (10th).</p>
<p>No Resistance Occurred</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Japanese army stationed in Saigon, some French military police in that area resisted the Japanese army. However, there was no resistance from the French troops and police stationed in Shanghai, and the process proceeded smoothly in a peaceful atmosphere. It is reported that before the concession was taken over, the French troops stationed in this city were stationed in the French concessions in the Yangtze River basin in the name of protecting French interests. Most of them were Annamese soldiers. After the National Government took over the concession, they were reorganized into the Vietnamese army and all concentrated in Shanghai in order to be withdrawn to Vietnam. After this measure, these troops and police officers will be treated as ordinary French citizens. However, in view of their past actions, they will not be allowed to have contact with people from other countries in the future.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Negotiations Cease</p>
<p>In addition to these armed groups, ordinary French residents who are not considered hostile will still adhere to the spirit of joint defense between Japan and Vietnam. Special leniency measures will be taken for general cooperators, including the protection of their lives and property and restrictions on residence. In addition to the disarming of the French army, restrictions have also been placed on communications. However, ordinary clear-text telegrams are still allowed to be used, which shows the leniency of the Japanese side. It is also expected that diplomatic negotiations between Chinese and Japanese agencies and French consular affairs will also cease.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Former French Concession</p>
<p>After the Japanese army disarmed the French troops in Shanghai and confiscated their military equipment, the reporter drove around the former French Concession for a week. He witnessed a peaceful atmosphere in the French barracks under the protection of the Japanese army. The French soldiers were still leisurely lying on the grass in the sports field, whistling. A large pile of military equipment was stacked on the side of the sports field. Looking at their attitude, there was no mention of military discipline or military law. In the hearts of every soldier, there was no sense of war at all, just like the bayonets had been removed from their waists. I went into Gujiazhai Park and couldn't find a single French person. It was all Chinese people sitting idly in the warm sunlight. This scene reminded the reporter that the East Asia of East Asians was about to arrive. Stepping out of the park, there were yellow military trucks of the Japanese army dragging French tanks on the road. The line seemed very long, but they were just old-fashioned tanks. People watching the excitement on the roadside sent them off with surprised eyes. When the reporter embarked on his journey, he deeply felt that the East Asia of East Asians was about to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Statement by the Japanese Army Authorities in Shanghai <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army authorities in Shanghai issued the following statement regarding the disposal of French troops and police in Shanghai:</p>
<p>"The local Japanese army implemented the disarmament of the French troops and police stationed in Shanghai this morning (10th). We deeply regret taking this measure, but it is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Our army stationed here requested the Vietnamese authorities to fulfill the previously agreed joint defense agreement in view of the current situation. However, the Vietnamese side lacked sincerity and refused our request. Therefore, we had to resort to partial military action.</p>
<p>The French troops and police in Shanghai lost their basis for existence after the transfer of the concession last year and have been incorporated into the Vietnamese army. Therefore, in order to prevent any incidents from occurring in Shanghai due to the situation in Vietnam, the local army, in response to the measures taken by the army stationed in Vietnam today, expresses its deep sympathy to the French army stationed in Shanghai, especially the French residents. The French authorities stationed in Shanghai recognized our army's true intentions and accepted our demands, allowing the measures to be carried out peacefully without any disputes. This is commendable for maintaining the security of Shanghai. The military authorities do not regard the French side, which holds a cooperative attitude, as an enemy. What we hope for now is that the French troops and French expatriates will recognize the intentions of the Japanese army, refrain from acting rashly, trust the Japanese army, and live in peace."</p>

<h3 id="e23">Social Welfare Bureau Promotes Relief Work; Director Zhou Speaks at a Press Conference <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The 7th press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held as usual at 2:30 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Director Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau attended to answer questions raised by the various newspapers regarding the bureau's recent administrative policies. The gist of his remarks is recorded below:</p>
<p>The bureau's administrative policies are all being implemented step by step in accordance with the mayor's instructions. We are now planning to start reorganizing the city's public welfare organizations and temples. Many charitable undertakings are carried out by the above-mentioned charitable organizations, which benefit the people. However, they often have to appeal to the outside world for fundraising due to lack of funds. Although they cannot be implemented according to the budget, the results are still enough to maintain their charitable undertakings. Their spirit of struggling to manage is admirable. In the past, general temples often spent huge sums of money to decorate the temples, entirely for their own interests, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, in my opinion, if temples can carry out relief work for the poor people and seek the welfare of the people in the future, then it will be in line with the original intention of compassion. The bureau has also participated in the winter relief work to provide porridge and the population evacuation work. Regarding the issue of population evacuation, the bureau had already discussed it with various hometown associations and formulated a plan, which has now been submitted to the Population Evacuation Committee. As for the recent factory closures due to reduced electricity, resulting in more unemployment, the bureau, in accordance with the Labor Law, has proposed to the factories that in addition to paying this month's salary as usual, the total amount of salary subsidies that should be received this month should be issued for three months so that the unemployed can temporarily maintain their lives. At present, landlords often increase the burden on tenants for various reasons, resulting in disputes, which are mediated in accordance with the Wartime Special Leasing Law.</p>

<p>Director Dai of the Bureau of Education, in view of the fact that various bookstores in the city publish various popular reading materials, many of which contain educational significance, while some are absurd and teach theft and obscenity, specially set up a review committee in accordance with the Interim Measures for Banning Bad Popular Reading Materials promulgated by the Ministry of Education. In addition to serving as the director of the committee, he also hired relevant personnel from all aspects to serve as members.

<h3 id="e25">It is hoped that the air defense equipment in public places will be improved; In order to cope with contingencies <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters stated that major buildings and mansions, as well as public places such as hotels, apartments, guesthouses, and theaters, do not pay much attention to the installation of air defense equipment. If yellow sand and clear water, as well as fire extinguishers, etc., are not prepared, it will inevitably cause extreme difficulties in extinguishing fires when attacked by incendiary bombs. At the same time, although there are fire exits, most of them are locked, which is extremely dangerous in case of emergency. Therefore, the air defense authorities hope to improve it in order to cope with emergencies.</p>

Then, Deputy Director Da Chuan delivered a speech, hoping that the police and Baojia in various districts would maintain closer ties in the future, so as to become one.</p>

It was also reported that 500 Baojia personnel from various Baojia districts would participate in the memorial ceremony for the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation at Daguanming at 9:00 am, and five people from each district would go to the Bund Park to participate in the tree planting ceremony.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo Serves as Director of the Municipal Baojia Committee</p>
<p>In the past, due to the lack of unified administration in this city, the municipal government established the Municipal Government Baojia Committee to implement unified command of the Baojia in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi districts, while the original district (including the former District One and District Eight) was supervised by the Urban Baojia Committee established by the Municipal Police Bureau. Now that the municipal administration has been unified, and the Baojia in the Huxi, Nanshi, and Zhabei districts have been successively taken over and merged by the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Urban Baojia Committee will adjust its organization in order to achieve smooth coordination and cooperation with public opinion, so as to achieve unification. Before the laws and regulations are unified and the organization is enriched, Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government is specially invited to serve as the director of the committee, so the work of the Urban Baojia Committee will be further strengthened and more fully developed in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Security Command Executes Three Guerrilla Bandits <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Guerrilla bandits Wei Xiangfa, Zhu Genquan, and Yao Jinfa have been disturbing local public security in the Nanhui area. In August last year, Wei Bandit, under the alias Zhu Qinlong, incited military rebellion in Pudong, while Zhu and Yao Bandits simultaneously colluded with Li Xiong, Shang Yongnian, Zhang Genlong, Wu, and others who were on the run, and robbed firearms from the Zhoujiadu Police Station in Pudong. They were subsequently arrested and transferred to the headquarters by the investigation team of the Municipal Security Command. After interrogation, the crimes committed were confirmed to be true, and they were sentenced to death. With the special permission of the Military Affairs Commission, the three bandits, including Wei Bandit, were taken from prison at 12:00 noon yesterday, their identities were verified, and they were tied and taken to the execution ground on Zhongshan Road and executed by firing squad to demonstrate a stern warning.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Post Office Explains Reasons for Mail Delivery Delay, Strengthening Delivery Organization <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>According to the local post office: Recently, the public has made many criticisms about mail delivery delays or undelivered mail. It has been found that the current mail delivery cannot be as satisfactory as people wish, which is actually due to the fact that the traffic conditions are not what they used to be. For example, the scarcity of ships, the abnormal operation of vehicles, etc., all cause delays in mail en route. According to recent surveys, delays in mail from other ports due to the above reasons occur every day, and even mail from Beijing and Hangzhou is sometimes delayed for two or three days before arriving. As for local mail, according to recent survey results, except for delays due to unexpected accidents or special reasons why mail cannot be delivered quickly, there are no other delays. The bureau has recently strengthened the delivery organization, and it is expected that deliveries will be made as soon as possible in the future. It is hoped that the public will retain the original envelopes for any delayed mail received. Send them directly to the Document Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration (please write "Postal Affairs" on the letter, no need to affix stamps) so that the cause can be traced and rectified. As for unregistered mail, according to the records, due to mail blockages, many mails from more distant bureaus have not yet arrived. If mail sent to other ports has not been received, it is also hoped that the sender will list the detailed items sent, such as the type of mail, the date of mailing, the place of mailing, the name and address of the recipient, the number of registered or express mail, etc., to the delivery bureau so that they can be traced in order and answered in detail. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.</p>

<p>Recently, diphtheria has been prevalent, and many cases have been found in schools. In order to prevent the invasion, the Municipal Health Bureau is conducting diphtheria toxoid injections for elementary school students. The cost of the medicine is borne by the students themselves, at 200 yuan per person. The Education Bureau has ordered all municipal elementary schools to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Incense and Candle Tax Office Officially Established <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Special Municipality Incense and Candle Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance was approved to handle the incense and candle tax in this city and its affiliated counties and districts, the promotion of tax administration has been improving day by day. All incense merchants once resisted payment, but after the office sent personnel to urge collection, they have all paid taxes in accordance with the regulations. The trial period of the office has now expired for three months. The Ministry of Finance has approved the office to formally undertake the work because the trial operation of the office has achieved remarkable results and the cooperation in increasing national tax revenue is commendable. In addition to continuing to appoint Wang Tanglin as the director, Zhu Zhengdong is also appointed as the deputy director. It is reported that after receiving the order, the office will abide by the regulations and open for regular office hours, and notify all incense and candle industry merchants under its jurisdiction to pay in accordance with the regulations, and must not neglect, so as not to hinder tax revenue.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Central Market Tour <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>The recent threat of vegetable prices to Shanghai citizens is indeed very serious. In order to know the recent vegetable price situation, the reporter specially went to the Central Market to visit. The Central Market is located on North Xizang Road, only forty or fifty steps away from the Xizang Road Bridge. As soon as you enter, you can see rows of straw sheds erected in the square, which is exactly at 7:30 in the morning. Inside, there is a lot of noise, and some vegetable vendors and rural women are crowding in. When the reporter walked into the market, he saw a wooden sign facing him, which read: Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market Wholesale Price List (price is calculated per市斤 [jin, approximately 500g or 1.1 lbs]). Another line of small characters reads: From March 9th to March 13th, year 34.</p>
<p>In order to further understand the truth, the reporter chatted with an old vegetable vendor. He was very friendly and talked endlessly like a family treasure. Here I discovered the simplicity of Chinese farmers. According to him: The official price cannot be used as a standard. The price of vegetables varies greatly depending on the weather and climate, and some things are in short supply and are needed, so the price exceeds the limit price; and others? Because they are easy to rot or arrive in large quantities, they are often lower than the limit price. It is not very reasonable to stipulate a certain price for vegetables from what day to what day. Because of this, the official price has become a mere formality.</p>
<p>Vegetable prices have fallen because the weather has turned warm in the past two days, and vegetables are growing very fast, and those that have already been pulled out are easy to rot and turn yellow, so the price has also plummeted. For example, the official price of green rape is 385 yuan per jin, but in fact it only costs 180 yuan; the official price of spinach is 226 yuan per jin, but in fact it only costs 150 yuan; the official price of yellow芽菜 (a type of Chinese cabbage) is as high as 509 yuan per jin, but because most citizens cannot afford it, the price is uselessly high. Yellow芽菜 is transported from Jiangbei or Qingdao and other remote places, and the loss is very large. It cannot be stored for a long time, and cannot be waited for a good price like other things such as rice. So it has to be sold at a reduced price. Now it can only be bought for 350 yuan per jin, but there are still very few people who want it; the official price of 塌棵菜 (another type of Chinese cabbage) is 385 yuan per jin, but in fact it can only be sold for more than 200 yuan. 韭芽 (garlic chives) are transported from Hangzhou by train. Because trains are sometimes delayed, the price inevitably rises. As soon as the train arrives, it immediately falls. As for芋艿 (taro), the official price is 226 yuan, but now it is not willing to sell for less than 300 yuan per jin. 山芋 (sweet potato) seems to be 113 yuan per jin, but in fact it has to be sold for 120 yuan to 150 yuan. This is because some people often use it as food, and the price starts to rise when there is a large demand.</p>
<p>The old vegetable vendor couldn't help but sighed at the end: "The golden age of vegetables has passed, and the purchasing power of the common people is indeed too weak! Our industry has reached the point of decline like other industries!"</p>
<p>Economic Cafeteria The Central Market has a building facing Suzhou Creek, where the offices of various industry associations and brokers are located. There are no less than twenty or thirty red, blue, large, and small magnetic signs at the entrance of the stairs. Among them, a price advertisement for the "Central Economic Cafeteria" is newly posted. The reporter was attracted by its low price, so he went up to the second floor and easily found the cafeteria. This is a large room about six 丈 [zhàng, approximately 3.3 meters] long and four 丈 wide, with seven or eight畏 (unsure of this character, potentially incorrectly identified) tables sparsely placed inside. Each table can seat six people. There are also five or six square tables, with soy sauce bottles, pepper bottles, and other condiments neatly placed on the tables. One corner of the room is the kitchen. There is a cashier's table at the door. The administrator of the cafeteria said that the cafeteria has been operating for five months and is managed by the Central Market authorities. Because there is a subsidy from the market, it is much cheaper than outside. Its prices are: Grade A meal 330 yuan per bowl, Grade B meal 280 yuan per bowl, Spicy Sauce Rice 500 yuan per serving, Savory Rice Soup 380 yuan per serving, Soup Noodles 290 yuan per bowl, Fried Noodles 350 yuan per bowl. In the morning, there are also snacks for sale, steamed buns 220 yuan for ten, and dumplings 220 yuan for ten. The lunch opening time is from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm. Although this is for the market staff, it also welcomes outsiders to eat, but a surcharge of 10% will be added. However, the small accounts and other expenses here are not charged. Yesterday, the social service department of this newspaper raised the issue of lunch for office workers. If there is enough time and you don't mind walking this not-too-far road, it is a good idea to go and eat once.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Business Tax Offices in Various Districts Establish Collection Directors, Set Up Tax Personnel Training Classes <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>In order to unify tax revenue and increase the city treasury, the Municipal Finance Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to implement business tax in the old one to eight districts starting this year. The spring business tax for this year has already begun to be collected. The bureau also recently convened a symposium of various trade associations in the city to explain the significance of imposing business tax and the procedures for merchants to declare and pay taxes. In order to facilitate tax payment by various merchants, the bureau has specially set up six business tax collection offices in the first to eighth districts, and the directors of each office have also been appointed and will start work immediately. The following are the collection directors: Wu Jinghe for the city center district, Tang Jiqing, section chief of the business section of the bureau, concurrently serves as the collection director of the Madang Road district, Qin Yiming for the Taishan Road district, Chai Shilin for the Huxi district, Yi Jiarong for the Zhabei district, and Li Zhengzhao for the Hongkou district. It is also reported that the bureau regards business tax as an important source of revenue for the city treasury. Whether the total amount of business tax and capital declared by various merchants are declared in accordance with the regulations and truthfully, or whether there are any cases of evasion or theft, should be strictly investigated. The investigation personnel are of great importance to the promotion of business tax and must be competent with tax administration skills. Therefore, the bureau has specially established a tax personnel training class to provide a considerable period of training for the newly recruited staff. They will be assigned investigation work. Luo, the concurrent director, Director Xu of the Secretariat, and Tang, the section chief of the business tax section, serve as instructors for the training class. Classes are held on assigned dates and times. The subjects include (1) spirit and conversation, (2) group discussion, (3) financial administration, (4) tax laws and regulations, (5) business laws and regulations, (6) accounting, (7) official document format, (8) investigation instructions, and (9) individual talks. The training period is two weeks. After the training period, they will be dispatched to undertake investigation work.</p>

<p>Since this city recovered the concessions and unified police administration, the Third Office of the Police Bureau has been actively planning to improve judicial affairs. However, judicial affairs are of great importance to human rights. If there is any imperfection, not only will the legal rights and interests of the people be unprotected, but also the dignity of national law will be affected. It is learned that the office intends to hold a judicial liaison meeting once a month in order to further study and seek improvement, in the hope of gaining more insights from judicial experts and facilitating business development. It is reported that the first liaison meeting has been scheduled for the 12th (tomorrow) at 3:00 pm in the meeting room on the seventh floor of the police bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Vegetable Industry Reduces Prices <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>This city suffered from unusually cold weather last winter, and the market price of vegetables rose sharply, which greatly affected the people's diet. The authorities are extremely concerned. After repeated strict orders, the industry has been striving to suppress and stabilize prices. It is learned that since spring is approaching, the output of vegetables in various places is gradually increasing, and the sources are also more abundant. The industry has ordered its members to reduce the wholesale price by 30% from the highest price last month. Therefore, the market price of vegetables in this city is expected to decline daily.</p>

<p>Wang Maoting of No. 147 Weihaiwei Road, "Russian General Assembly," colluded with the chairman of the association, Ge Libaofu, to set up a private gambling den under the guise of the "General Assembly" to gather crowds to gamble, and attempted to bribe Li Guohua, the director of the newly formed sub-bureau in charge, with 300,000 yuan. Director Li reported the bribe and the details of the gambling den to the General Bureau. Li Shiyu, Director of the Third Office of the General Bureau, ordered Liu Shaokui, Section Chief of the Investigation and Trial Section, to join forces with Li Guohua, Director of the Xincheng Sub-bureau, and Liu Junqing, Director of the Third Section, to lead officers and break up the gambling den last month. The owner of the den, Wang Maoting, the manager, Han Huaqing, the chairman, Ge Libaofu, and 174 gamblers were arrested. It is learned that the bureau has completed the investigation and trial of the case and will transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office in the next few days for investigation and handling in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>The Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society is located at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Jiaozhou Road in this city. It is well-managed, charges are low, and there are many patients seeking treatment. In particular, it is able to be considerate and provide fee reductions and exemptions for indigent inpatients. At a time when prices are soaring and incomes are meager, the hospital's funding has been exhausted and it is no longer sustainable. It is learned that the Shanghai Football Association has sponsored a football match to be held on the 15th of this month at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road, and all proceeds from ticket sales will be used for the hospital's expenses. The hospital director, Wen Lanting, has written letters to personally distribute the tickets. There are three types of honor tickets: 20,000, 15,000, and 3. Considering Wen's advanced age, hard work in serving society, and benefiting the people, it is believed that all parties will be able to enthusiastically contribute and achieve satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City Bureau of Finance's Substitute Anhui Cigarette Retail Consumption Special Tax Committee, established on March 4th of this year, has announced through the Bureau of Finance that special consumption taxes on non-rationed cigarettes will be collected by various cigarette agents and submitted regularly to the Committee for consolidation and transfer to the Bureau of Finance for verification and receipt, effective from the 11th of this month. The method for collecting taxes on rationed cigarettes has also been stipulated and announced for implementation, as recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The special consumption tax on rationed cigarettes is stipulated to begin collection from the 48th issue.</p>
<p>(2) For the 48th issue of rationed cigarettes, as the goods were shipped before February 1st of this year, a special consumption tax of 4% should be levied. From the 49th issue onwards, a special consumption tax of 5% should be levied.</p>
<p>(3) The retail price will be used as the standard for levying the special consumption tax on cigarettes.</p>
<p>(4) The retail price should be calculated by adding 20% to the wholesale price (i.e., the purchase price from wholesalers).</p>
<p>(5) The special consumption tax on rationed cigarettes payable by each retailer for each issue shall be collected by the respective wholesalers in charge, and shall be collected in full by the deadline specified in the tax payment notice and submitted to the designated collection point for transfer to the Committee for consolidation and transfer to the Bureau of Finance for verification and receipt.</p>
<p>(6) The Committee will issue official receipts stamped with the seal of the Bureau of Finance to each wholesaler upon payment of taxes.</p>
<p>(7) If any retailer refuses to pay taxes, the wholesaler in charge is permitted to report it to the Committee in writing, which will then be forwarded to the Bureau of Finance for punishment.</p>
<p>(8) If any wholesaler fails to pay taxes by the deadline, the Committee will report it to the Bureau of Finance for punishment.</p>
<p>(9) Those who have already paid the special tax can present their receipts to the Committee for verification, but those who have not paid the full tax must still make up the difference.</p>
<p>The above methods have been announced by the Committee to all wholesalers for compliance. It is also heard that the Bureau of Finance is paying exceptional attention to this reorganization of cigarette consumption tax. Any cigarette merchant who delays or refuses to pay taxes under any pretext, and any cigarette factory that fails to perform diligently, will be punished according to regulations without any leniency, in order to safeguard national taxes.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Overview of Iwo Jima <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>A desolate wasteland. The area of Iwo Jima is only twenty square kilometers, shaped like a gourd ladle, with the larger part facing north. This island is completely different in nature from the so-called Father Island and Mother Island groups of the Mount Fuji volcanic system. The highest point is Mount Suribachi at the southern end, 120 meters above sea level. The rest is mostly small hills and plains of about 50 to 100 meters. The ground of this island is not lava, but tuff solidified from the volcanic ash unique to this island. The desert area occupies the southern half of the island. With a gust of wind, the sand dunes immediately change their position, which is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Wengohama and Nigenhama are directly below Takasago Plateau, up to the Chishima Beach on the west coast, which is the narrowest part of the island, with a width of less than one kilometer. Both the east and west coasts are flat sandy beaches, and the sea waves are particularly calm. From this beach to Mount Suribachi and Chishima Plain, it is necessary to climb high cliffs of 50 meters. The southern half of the island is barren, but the north has villages, tropical plants grow lushly, and it is a good windbreak forest. There are precious timbers such as huangquan and meitan, as well as rare species such as screw pines, as well as cocoa coconuts, wild coconuts, castor oil, agave, and wild bananas and tree melons.</p>
<p>Seawater like boiling water. Along the coast of Kamiyama Beach, Tateiwa Hana, etc., there are crashing waves and steep cliffs. On the surface of Onsenhama, the seawater is like boiling water. On this island, because there are few opportunities to take a bath, making bathing a very precious thing.</p>
<p>The island was formed by submarine volcanic eruptions. The cliffs of the northern soil dan stone retain obvious traces of sea erosion everywhere, indicating that this island was once below sea level, and then rose above the sea. The uplift movement of the ground is about one foot per year, and the coastline changes every year.</p>
<p>This island belongs to the new Quaternary volcanic line. To this day, the embers have not been extinguished. There are sulfur holes that emit a large amount of gas. Near Motoyama, hot water of about 100 degrees Celsius gushes out as long as you dig to a depth of 30 centimeters underground. And there is a lot of sulfur, and the surrounding area is all yellow. In the geothermal area, hot air is steaming, and the heat of the ground is enough to make people unable to sit or lie down for a long time, so it is impossible to get water from digging wells there, and all water depends on rainwater.</p>
<p>Products on the island. It can be said that there is no "soil" on the island, only fine powder of tuff and soil dan stone, and farming is very difficult. Food cannot be self-sufficient. There are only medicinal plants such as takane (raw material for Takakain) and vegetables, pumpkins, watermelons, lemongrass (raw material for lotion), sweet potatoes, sugar cane, bananas, cotton, pineapples, and cucumbers. But there is not a single grain of rice.</p>
<p>The aquatic products in the nearby sea include mackerel and cod, most of which are for consumption on the island. There are several cattle and chickens as livestock. There are absolutely no snakes or scorpions on the island, and there are few mosquitoes. There are no malarial mosquitoes at all. In addition to the absence of sparrows and crows, there are gannets, Chishima birds, albatrosses, etc., which are not only enough to entertain the ears and eyes, but also have droppings that are excellent fertilizers.

<h3 id="e49">Berlin Under the Threat of War <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Since the start of the Red Army's winter offensive, Germany has undoubtedly faced the biggest crisis since the start of the war. The German people are directly exposed to the fierce flames of war, which is also unprecedented. Although the pressure from the Red Army still shows no signs of abating, the desperate resistance of the German army in various war zones has been effective. On the whole, the whirlwind-like anxiety in the first few weeks has now been overcome. In order to prevent the Red Army from breaking through the German defense line, the entire city of the capital Berlin has been fortified. Obstacles have been placed on the main roads in the city. Although it is frequently bombed by the British and American air forces, the damaged transportation networks can be quickly repaired. The German authorities' swift handling is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Intensified thrift. After the start of the Red Army's winter offensive, the German authorities immediately strengthened coal saving measures. Electricity, gas, and automobiles were all saved. The hardship of life in the rear became increasingly severe. However, with Upper Silesia, a coal supply area, becoming a battlefield today, it is inevitable that ordinary citizens find it difficult to obtain fuel. Rooms without stoves were already very cold, and the glass windows were broken due to bombing, so they had to wear coats to work and eat. This is the scene in Berlin today.</p>
<p>The newspapers in the city have also been greatly reorganized, changed to two pages per day. Many have already become victims of the large-scale air raid on February 3, so they have reduced the size of the page and changed to two small pages. News about economy, academics, etc. has disappeared. All records, except for war situation information, are scathing comments on the Three-Power Conference. Recently, the news has been filled with various descriptions of the terrible atrocities of the Red Army witnessed in the Red Army's invasion zone.</p>
<p>Fighting for survival. "No matter what the content of the German settlement case at the Crimean Conference is, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union always want to eliminate Germany. In this urgent crisis today, the people have no other way but to rise up to save the country and save themselves!" Such a painful tone can be seen in the newspapers in Berlin and heard on the radio.</p>
<p>However, the general citizens of Berlin are calm and composed, and the calmness of their attitude is surprising. What will happen when Berlin really turns into a battlefield? I am afraid it will not be clear until then. (Special correspondent Kato, translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, February 16)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Shanghai Municipal Administration Zhou Weihai Topic Fifth Issue How to Stabilize Prices <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The severity of Shanghai's commodity prices can be said to have reached its peak today. All daily necessities are rising day by day, racing towards the summit. Although there has been a slight decline and a period of hovering, it was not long before they began to stir again and rise slowly. This cyclical inflationary trend, based on the experience of the past few years of war, can be said to repeat itself, and the beginning and end are exactly the same. As a result, commodity prices are rising higher and higher, and the people are in dire straits. With a few exceptions, most are mortgaging their possessions to survive and have no way to borrow money. The so-called "starving people in the wild" and "malnourished people," can be said to be a true portrayal of ordinary people today. If current commodity prices cannot be stabilized, people's livelihood cannot be maintained. Since the new Shanghai municipal authorities took over, the people have embraced them with great enthusiasm, and the authorities have indeed held determination to rectify, such as strictly prohibiting corruption, eliminating extortion, improving treatment, recruiting talents, and issuing low-priced rice to supplement the insufficient household rations, and setting prices to seek stability of commodity prices. All these wise measures are worthy of great praise, and in fact, commodity prices did decline and stabilize once. However, it was not long before spring grass grew wildly, and the ashes rekindled. Recently, commodity prices have been rising again, especially rice and gold, which have been jumping even more fiercely. The cyclical inflationary trend of commodity prices has not been eradicated. This is an undeniable fact, which not only fails to meet the authorities' painstaking efforts, but also fails to satisfy the people's hopes. However, the issue of commodity prices is ultimately the center of people's livelihood issues. The severity of commodity price issues is increasing, which means that the pain of people's livelihood has not been relieved. Based on my limited experience, I will briefly express my humble opinions on how to stabilize commodity prices:</p>
<p>(1) Strive for the People's Trust Any undertaking that wants to be done well cannot be supported solely by one or two leaders, and must obtain the obedience and cooperation of all employees. Moreover, it is even more difficult to manage Shanghai's municipal administration well in this complex environment. However, the determination and aspirations of the municipal authorities have already been made clear to the general public. However, the old evil forces cannot disappear and are doing their best to sabotage. The supply of daily necessities is still not on time and in sufficient quantity, which does not meet the needs of the people. The rise in commodity prices, in addition to being cyclical, is not unrelated to this. I remember Mayor Zhou saying, "In times of chaos, use severe punishment." In the past, Wei Yang moved trees and Qin was governed well, and Wu Hou punished traitors and Shu was at peace. Today, human desires are rampant, and integrity and shame are injured. People do not hesitate to be opportunistic and run for profit, hoping to make a fortune, regardless of harming the country or public welfare, laughing at whatever people say, I will make a fortune myself. With this trend in place, commodity prices will never be stabilized. With this trend growing, the people will never have trust. This is what the municipal authorities should clearly understand and strive to overcome all difficulties, rectify discipline, and severely punish those who manipulate commodity prices and raise commodity prices to set an example for others. This can not only show the authorities' determination, but also gain the people's trust. Otherwise, the thunder is loud and the rain is light, and empty words seem to be of no help to the facts!</p>
<p>(2) Limit the Utility of Currency Selfishness and self-interest are human nature. Changing the social atmosphere depends on the authorities' plans. Take the First World War as an example. The facts of the German people pursuing exorbitant profits are countless. However, the situation is different in this war. Rather than saying that it is an improvement in national character, it is better to say that it is effective control. During wartime, the shortage of materials and inflation are unavoidable facts. This is not only the case in our country, but also in Germany and Japan—because they have good control over materials and strict management of commodity prices, and at the same time, the rationing system is sound and established. Regardless of whether people are rich or poor, in addition to using their income to purchase cheap rationed materials to maintain their livelihood, all surplus currency cannot be used to purchase any materials in any market. Currency has been cut off from materials, so commodity prices can be stabilized. The deposits in the hands of the people, in addition to being used for savings or purchasing government bonds, can be said to have no other way out. On the contrary, the government's rationing system should be able to maintain the people's minimum living standards. Even if we take a step back, we should achieve "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality" in order to gain the people's trust and cooperation without any complaints. However, although the value of our country's currency is low, its utility is great. If people cannot obtain a large amount of currency, they cannot maintain their lives or enjoy themselves to the fullest. The root cause of the suffering of the general public is here, and the root cause of rampant corruption is also here. It is certainly difficult to implement a perfect rationing system immediately, and it can be said that it is even more difficult to separate the value of currency from commodity prices immediately. However, in any case, the utility of currency should be greatly limited, such as cracking down on high-end entertainment venues, improving material control, and eliminating black market prices. We must gradually promote their realization so that the utility of the existing currency is reduced and its value is increased, which will have considerable benefits for stabilizing commodity prices!</p>
<p>(3) Eradicate Hoarding Psychology During wartime, inflation and material shortages are normal. People are either afraid of material shortages and purchase them in advance, or predict future situations and hoard them in advance. This can reduce the burden and gain great benefits. It can be said that everything is taken care of for personal consideration. However, there is definitely more than one clever person in the world. If everyone hoards, commodity prices will naturally rise. Of course, this is as desired for individuals. However, because commodity prices rise sharply, the amount of currency issued by the country must expand, and they reciprocate, mutually causing each other. As a result, the rise in commodity prices is competing with the increase in currency issuance. Not only will the national finances go bankrupt, but the general public will also be impoverished. Even those who are hoarding, because of the limitation of individual purchasing power, I am afraid that their gains will still be minimal. Even if they make a fortune and become richer than the country, they are exploiting the people's wealth. The so-called "those who enter illegally will leave illegally," and those who do many unrighteous deeds will not have good results. As Deng Tong starved to death and Shi Chong was executed in the marketplace, there are countless precedents. When they realize that they are burdened by wealth, it is already too late. Moreover, the government can implement various laws and regulations, first conducting a detailed investigation of deposits and hoarding situations, or levying wartime profit taxes, or selling public bonds, or rewarding whistleblowers so that all hoarding profits are confiscated by the government. This is an act that harms others without benefiting oneself. Why do it with such persistence! It is hoped that the authorities can act vigorously and strictly enforce the law, which will not only enrich the national treasury and stabilize commodity prices, but also invisibly curb the hoarding trend.</p>
<p>(4) Disperse Excess Population In order to reduce the damage of wartime air raids, the population of cities should be dispersed immediately. There are precedents in various countries, so I will not discuss them in detail. Shanghai is the only major industrial and commercial city in our country. Whether it is for the safety of life or the continuation of production, dispersing excess population is an inevitable trend. In addition, from an economic point of view, adapting to the current environment, regulating the surplus and deficiency of materials, and dispersing the population of Shanghai are also necessary. Taking Shanghai's rationing system as an example, the reason why it is difficult to satisfy the people is that the diverse origins of the citizens and the insufficient supply of materials are the main reasons. Rather than talking about impossible ways to unblock sources and increase production, it is better to implement population dispersal and reduce needs. After a part of the population is dispersed, the demand for materials will decrease accordingly. All speculators and hoarders will have no way to spread rumors and sway people's minds because there are fewer targets. Furthermore, in terms of Shanghai and Nanjing, the reason why commodity prices are more stable in Nanjing is that the difference in population is of great significance. Therefore, if we can actively disperse the population of Shanghai, it will also have a great effect on stabilizing commodity prices in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The rise in commodity prices has its independence and its interconnectedness. Because it has independence, its price can fluctuate due to its own supply and demand relationship (whether artificial or natural). Due to its interconnectedness, the rise and fall of various commodity prices can often affect other commodity prices or be affected by the rise and fall of other commodity prices. The fact that commodity prices in Shanghai have risen to today's level is not something that happened overnight, so it is by no means something that can be achieved overnight to stabilize them. However, if materials cannot be controlled and rationing cannot be fulfilled, it is difficult for commodity prices to have any hope of stability. It is hoped that the municipal authorities can not avoid difficulties, not be afraid of complaints, comprehensively plan and take practical countermeasures, and then use determination to stabilize commodity prices. No matter how rampant commodity prices are, they can be made to submit.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Issue of Fair-Priced Rice Distribution in Schools <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Feeling Disheartened</p>
<p>The municipal authorities, at this critical juncture when the black market price of rice has surpassed the 100,000 yuan mark per picul, have sold a large quantity of rice to various sectors at a fair price of over 37,000 yuan per picul. Although this may not entirely solve the food problem that most threatens the city's people, it undoubtedly has a greater impact on stabilizing the lives of the city's residents than any previous measures aimed at stabilizing the people's livelihood. This is an undeniable fact. Faced with such a reality, we cannot help but be grateful to the municipal authorities for sincerely seeking to alleviate the suffering of the citizens. However, on the other hand, we are deeply saddened and indignant that some unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the opportunity to engage in corruption, creating a situation of "not worrying about scarcity, but worrying about inequality." As a result, the municipal authorities' sincere benevolence towards the people only benefits a few cunning individuals, while the majority of law-abiding citizens are excluded from the benefits. Take the issue of fair-priced rice distribution in schools as an example. The approval of quantities lacks any standard, schools underreport the number of teachers and staff when applying, and the amount of rice distributed among teachers and staff varies from school to school. These are all terrible phenomena that we cannot remain silent about.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the situation when applying for the second phase of fair-priced rice for schools. The staff at the office did not arrive at work until after 10:00 AM, despite the fact that hundreds of people requesting application forms had been waiting. At a time when we are strengthening the wartime system, this kind of phenomenon should not occur. This is the first point. When obtaining application forms, those who arrived first were often rejected by the staff, who claimed that "they had already been issued." However, those who arrived later and were acquainted with the staff could obtain them at will, and the quantity was not limited. Such behavior, which uses personal likes and dislikes as a criterion for handling public affairs, undoubtedly goes against fairness. This is the second point. As the number of applicants increased in the second phase, it became necessary to implement a reduction in the quantity. However, the implementation of the reduction lacked any standard. Some schools that were approved for 12 piculs in the first phase were reduced to 6 piculs in the second phase. Some schools that were approved for 7 piculs in the first phase were also reduced to 6 piculs in the second phase. Others were reduced from 4 piculs to 3 piculs, from 10 piculs to 7 piculs, and from 23 piculs to 21 piculs. What was the basis for such arbitrary approvals? This not only violates fairness but also inevitably leads to misunderstandings. Regarding this point, those responsible for handling fair-priced rice for schools should publicly announce their approval standards. At the same time, they should also publish the number of applicants from each school and the approved quantities in the newspapers to demonstrate transparency. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The above three points require explanation from those in charge of handling fair-priced rice for schools. Secondly, what we should expose is the practice of schools using the method of underreporting numbers to deceive the authorities and obtain extra quantities. It is said that some schools have only 130 students, but the number of teachers and staff reported when applying for fair-priced rice is over 180. As for principals listing their wives, sons, nephews, and other relatives as school employees to increase the amount they can apply for, there are countless examples. Although this phenomenon is caused by the disregard for public interest by unscrupulous villains with moral failings, the failure of those responsible to conduct thorough investigations to expose their deceitful behavior is also a mistake.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no uniform method for distributing fair-priced rice among teachers and staff in various schools. Some distribute it equally, some distribute it based on the number of teaching hours, and others distribute it based on the importance of the position held. Among these three methods, using the number of teaching hours as the distribution standard is the fairest. Since the news of the authorities implementing priority allocation was released, many opportunists have spared no effort to use all kinds of tricks. Some are willing to work entirely on a voluntary basis, teaching one or two hours per week. Their focus is not on the small teaching salary but on obtaining various priority allocation items. Therefore, equal distribution will allow these opportunists to succeed in their schemes, while those who bear the actual responsibility for teaching will be exploited. As for using the importance of the position held as a distribution standard, it is also unfair in practice. A principal should not eat more than others simply because they are the principal, and a teacher should not eat less than others simply because they are a teacher. Therefore, distributing fair-priced rice based on this standard, although it does not imply using one's position to obtain a larger quantity, we believe that the most reasonable distribution standard is based on the teaching hours per week stipulated by the Ministry of Education. For example, if a middle school teacher teaches 20 periods per week, then all teachers who teach 20 periods or more per week should receive one share. Those who teach less than 20 periods but more than 10 periods should receive half a share, and those who teach less than 10 periods should receive a quarter of a share. Full-time staff who are stationed at the school should be counted as one share. This way, the benefits of the government's relief to the education sector can be distributed fairly, according to the amount of effort each educator contributes to education.</p>
<p>The second distribution of fair-priced rice is not far away. I humbly offer the above suggestions and hope that those who are interested will study them together to find a reasonable method.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Regarding the Evacuation Area of Dongting Mountain <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Na Ya</p>
<p>I read Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's article "Proposal to Open Dongting Mountain as an Evacuation Area for Shanghai Residents" in the previous issue of this publication. I believe that Dongting Mountain is quite suitable as an evacuation area for Shanghai residents, but there are other issues that were not mentioned in the article. I am writing them down here for further discussion.</p>
<p>A. Environmental Issues: The environment of Dongting Mountain is better in the East Mountain than in the West Mountain. The houses in West Mountain are sparsely scattered, not as lively as East Mountain. Although West Mountain produces fruits, tea, fish, shrimp, and vegetables, there are not many trees. Dongting Mountain, although named "Mountain," is actually a small island in Taihu Lake. However, there are several small mountains locally, hence the name "Mountain." At present, half of the trees in the area have been felled, and only a few fruit trees remain. Fuelwood can still be used temporarily, and there are still a small amount of reserves locally, but a solution must be found in the long term.</p>
<p>Dongting Mountain does not produce much grain. Due to the current heavy taxes, there are fewer and fewer farmers. Therefore, the local grain supply relies entirely on imports from other places. However, transporting grain is not something that ordinary people can do. There are many pirate ships in Taihu Lake, and it may be difficult to transport it safely. The only solution is for the government to escort it.</p>
<p>If people move to Dongting Mountain, local prices will inevitably rise. When people from Shanghai and Suzhou fled to Dongting Mountain during the August 13th Incident, local prices rose sharply. This must be prevented.</p>
<p>Local security is currently not guaranteed. Most of the people currently living in the area are unemployed vagrants, and few wealthy people live there. The main reason is that there are too many kidnappers, and wealthy people dare not live there. It is necessary to send troops to station there and select young and strong residents to organize a self-defense force for defense. Taihu Lake has always been a den of bandits, so special attention must be paid. It is best to send troops to wipe them out completely to achieve a permanent solution.</p>
<p>B. Relocation Method: I advocate opening both the East and West Mountains of Dongting Mountain as evacuation areas. Because East Mountain has more houses than West Mountain, and many are vacant, some people with limited financial resources can rent houses in East Mountain to avoid having to build new houses in West Mountain. Wealthy people can invest in building houses on vacant land in both the East and West Mountains.</p>
<p>Wood for building houses must be transported in advance, as there is no wood for building houses locally. The unemployed vagrants living in the mountains in the past dismantled and sold their ancestral houses. Therefore, on the one hand, wood must be transported in advance, and on the other hand, it must be strictly prohibited to dismantle and sell houses again.</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Dongting Mountain, one can go by land to Suzhou, and then by water to Dongting Mountain, or hire a boat directly. If there are no appropriate methods for transportation and along the way protection, evacuation may be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>C. Other Issues: In terms of education, Dongting East Mountain still has a relatively complete primary school, while West Mountain only has a few private schools. If there are many immigrants, more schools must be established. Fortunately, there are many large buildings in East Mountain that can be used to set up middle schools or specialized schools. Secondly, there are very few doctors locally, and if there are many immigrants, it will not be enough. Therefore, doctors are also needed. Furthermore, there is no industry or developed commerce locally. It is very necessary to establish factories and businesses on the mountain.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Map of the Situation on the Eastern and Western Fronts of Europe <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>On the Eastern Front, German and Soviet troops are facing each other on the west bank of the Oder River. The Soviet army is using Kolberg, Stargard in Pomerania, and the north bank of the Nietze River east of Küstrin as bases, but there has been no progress to date. On the Western Front, part of the Anglo-American Allied forces has broken through the Siegfried Line, and its foremost troops have invaded the areas along the Rhine River, such as Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn, and Koblenz, and have begun crossing the river to fight. However, German resistance has intensified in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Rice <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Qianli</p>
<p>Mr. Bai suddenly thought about doing some business.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Bai didn't agree at first:</p>
<p>"You're going to do business again? How much did you lose on that stock last time? You almost didn't get your principal back..."</p>
<p>"It's different this time..." Mr. Bai protested.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" Mrs. Bai stopped him: "I've always said that people like us are never good at doing business, we don't have anything. It's better to be content and not dream of getting rich!"</p>
<p>"But, dear," Mr. Bai warned, "do you know how much we spend in a month? And how much we earn? - In this day and age, who still wants to get rich?"</p>
<p>So Mrs. Bai had nothing to say. She was in charge of the household, how could she not know how much their income and expenses differed these days? If Mr. Bai hadn't been trying everywhere, their family would have starved to death long ago. But thinking about doing business, Mrs. Bai always felt a little disheartened. Not to mention anything else, just take the last time Mrs. Bai sold her only jewelry to let Mr. Bai buy stocks. The result wasn't a complete mess, and they became someone else's victims. This time...</p>
<p>"This time, what do you want to do again?" Mrs. Bai asked with concern.</p>
<p>"Today they said at the bureau that the price of rice is bound to rise in the next few days. I asked a few rice dealers across the street, and it's already a bit more expensive than it was a few days ago. So, I plan to buy one or two piculs of rice. In the future, I'll sell it to the people in our lane."</p>
<p>"Where will you get the capital?" Mrs. Bai's heart turned around a bit.</p>
<p>"I think," Mr. Bai said confidently, "one or two piculs isn't much, 100,000 yuan is enough. I'll discuss it with Lao Lu, and at most, I'll acknowledge a little interest to him. I've calculated that I can pay back the principal and interest within a month, and I can net 50,000 to 60,000."</p>
<p>"What's the use of 50,000 to 60,000?" Mrs. Bai poured a bucket of cold water.</p>
<p>"It's better than nothing, dear!" Mr. Bai said, "After all, people like us are just doing small business with small profits. What big development are we thinking about?"</p>
<p>Without any ambiguity, Mr. Bai calculated the matter very carefully. He planned to buy two piculs of rice and guaranteed that it would double in price in a month. When the momentum was at its highest, he would sell it, and he could get back the principal and interest. Even if he acknowledged an interest of 15%, he could net 50,000 to 60,000 without any problem.</p>
<p>"What's the use of 50,000 to 60,000?" He remembered his wife's words again.</p>
<p>That was true, but he couldn't think about those things now. Mr. Bai thought that he had to act quickly if he wanted to do it.</p>
<p>The next day, as soon as he left the office, he went to find Lao Lu.</p>
<p>"I can't even turn around my own funds, I'm really sorry, old friend!" That gentleman cupped his hands to him, indicating that there was no way.</p>
<p>"The amount is actually limited," Mr. Bai said.</p>
<p>"The amount is indeed not much, but I'm really tight on cash these days. Otherwise, I'll try to think of a way for you, but I'm afraid I'll have to acknowledge a little interest."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter! Of course, I have to acknowledge interest, please, please."</p>
<p>Two days later, Lao Lu replied to him that he had only managed to get 50,000, and the interest was 20%.</p>
<p>"What a ruthless hand!" Mr. Bai put down the phone and glared at the telephone again.</p>
<p>The clerks and staff in the office were all chirping about the salary increase.</p>
<p>"Lao Bai, have you heard the news?" Someone shouted to him: "I heard that we're getting three more pecks of rice this month - not ration rice, but a rice subsidy."</p>
<p>Mr. Bai shook his head.</p>
<p>"There's no such cheap thing!" The second person replied; "Do you know how much rice costs today? - 64,000!"</p>
<p>Mr. Bai's heart jumped.</p>
<p>"I can't buy two piculs!" he thought, "Damn! I really have to hurry, just buy 100,000 worth."</p>
<p>"64,000?" Someone continued on the other side: "Watch, I won't be named Wu if it doesn't reach 100,000 in the next few days!"</p>
<p>That Mr. Wu was right, the price of rice jumped up day by day, 65,000, 68,000, 72,000, 74,000...</p>
<p>Mr. Bai's heart also jumped up day by day. He was busy inquiring about the price of rice every day, and Mrs. Bai was also worried about the picul of rice they had just bought, it had been raining these days, and she was afraid it would get wet and no one would want it in the future.</p>
<p>But what really worried her was the rice in their own house. There was only a little more than one peck left in the jar, which was only enough for their family to eat for five or six days. What would they do after they finished it, the price of rice outside was so expensive.</p>
<p>"I think we should eat that picul of rice ourselves," she said to her husband.</p>
<p>"You're crazy," Mr. Bai said loudly, "What will we use to pay people back if we eat it all? - I don't think there's a big problem with the rice at home. They say that we have hope of getting a rice subsidy this month. Two pecks, enough to eat for ten days."</p>
<p>"You're just daydreaming," Mrs. Bai muttered.</p>
<p>But in this day and age, daydreaming is really not easy to do. People often find that none of the previous ideals are realized later, and all the early plans are in vain. Just like that clerk Mr. Bai, just as his wife said, he was really good at daydreaming. However, just as he himself said, they were not people who were good at doing business.</p>
<p>A few days passed, there was no news of the rice subsidy from the bureau, but the price of rice was still rising every day, rising and rising.</p>
<p>"It's easy to sell," Mrs. Bai said more than once.</p>
<p>"Early days!" Mr. Bai comforted her: "It's bound to reach 100,000 in these few days!"</p>
<p>"Don't be greedy..."</p>
<p>"Look, you're at it again," Mr. Bai was a little angry: "Saying I'm greedy, what for?"</p>
<p>"But what are we going to do about our family?" Mrs. Bai had to change the subject.</p>
<p>"As long as the rice is sold, everything will be easy to handle."</p>
<p>But the rice was still not sold.</p>
<p>The price of rice came back down!</p>
<p>It came down by 2,000 on the first day, and another 1,000 on the second day, and the third day...</p>
<p>"What to do?" Mrs. Bai was anxious and restless.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it will go back up again. This is an ebb tide, it won't last long, - it will have to rise again."</p>
<p>But this time Mr. Bai didn't see it right, the price of rice actually stopped. - Maybe it will rise again in the future, but at least it stopped moving for a while.</p>
<p>This made Mr. Bai uneasy. He began to regret not selling it when the momentum was at its highest a few days ago. Now it was still in his hands, and he had to acknowledge a big interest. It was really hard on himself to sell it now, after being busy for so many days.</p>
<p>"I think forget it," Mrs. Bai said that same line again: "We're never good at doing business, other people do it well, but when we do it, we're unlucky. If we don't sell it, we don't even have to think about getting our principal back."</p>
<p>"Are we just going to sell it like this!"</p>
<p>"What else can we do if we don't sell it?" This time Mrs. Bai had experience: "Waiting for rice to cook, that's how our family has always been. Now, you're still holding on to it, are you going to borrow money from people again to buy rice for ourselves?"</p>
<p>"Then," Mr. Bai made a decision: "You ask in the lane tomorrow if anyone wants it."</p>
<p>The next day, Mrs. Bai ran to number seventeen as soon as she had time.</p>
<p>"Mother Zhou, do you want rice? The man of our nanny's family brought more than one picul to ask me to ask you."</p>
<p>"What's the price?"</p>
<p>"He said according to the market price, - but, I think it can always be a bit cheaper."</p>
<p>"Alright, but the rice has to be good," the other party said, "Mrs. Bai, you know, these rice dealers are really slippery!"</p>
<p>An hour later, the money and goods were cleared.</p>
<p>Mr. Bai settled the principal and interest with the people, and the remaining money was just enough to buy a few pecks of rice.</p>
<p>He originally planned to buy a pair of leather shoes, but when he went to that store, the price of a size 65 had already changed to 14,500.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bai also originally planned to wait for the money from the rice to use it to make her old coat new, but now, of course, she didn't mention it.</p>
<p>Just like that, Mr. Bai ended this business of his.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Commemorating the Hundredth Issue of Bai Mao, Part One <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shengquan</p>
<p>Many people are cursing time, saying how cruel it is, turning all the strong into the old, and only making people feel sad in recollection; however, I want to say, is it not also the merit of time to nurture a fragile infant into a strong and thriving youth, arousing infinite hope? Time itself is not guilty, it is a fair record, showing what is degenerating and what is progressing!</p>
<p>Bai Mao has been published for a hundred issues from its founding to the present. Is it degenerating or progressing? This is a very complicated question. It is difficult to hope that a malnourished child will be perfectly healthy. What time is it now, allowing your songs and cries to excite people's emotions? However, it is still growing strongly, growing. Undoubtedly, its future is bright.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people, looking up at the sky, laughed aloud in their noses after reading one or two issues of Bai Mao, what is this thing! However, I want to tell them, what you are laughing at is precisely the most precious part of Bai Mao. Most of the people who write articles for it regularly are young people with passionate emotions but lacking writing skills. Its growth is not the loneliest, it can receive many, many articles that are not from "writers" every day. To exaggerate a bit, it can be called a rice paddy in the literary world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bai Mao is not completely without mature works. There are several young people who love literature and are cultivating it with sweat. When they are serving readers in other publications to the point of impatience, they shouted out sincere voices in Bai Mao. This is not just their articles, but also the beating of their conscience!</p>
<p>Time is a fair record. After a hundred issues, Bai Mao may have a new face in the literary world of Shanghai. Whether it is degenerating or progressing, there will be many fair people to evaluate it. I hope that readers and authors who love Bai Mao will work hard to nurture its growth!</p>
<p>Part Two - Chen Xin</p>
<p>Two years ago, Bai Mao presented its first issue to us. For a hundred issues, as the editor said in the inaugural speech: "Our Bai Mao hopes to be a Bai Mao in the literary world: with a great spirit, extraordinary beauty, and a use that is not a small supplement to people."</p>
<p>Just like its name, Bai Mao is a wild grass, not a famous flower. Naturally, it will not be welcomed by those who admire famous flowers. However, which domestic grass is not grown from wild grass? "The spring breeze blows again," can those famous flowers have such vitality? Can they withstand wind and rain?</p>
<p>Naturally, there are still some unsatisfactory places and some shortcomings in the past hundred issues. However, when we think that almost all the people supporting this garden are young people, these shortcomings should be forgiven, shouldn't they? Moreover, this place is also full of vitality.</p>
<p>Hope is always in the future. Bai Mao is young and full of vigor and vitality. I believe it will grow up quickly.</p>

<p>Afraid that the branches are swaying,</p>

<p>Afraid of that joyful warm wind,</p>
<p>Shaking up a full of excitement,</p>

<p>Falling in the lonely wilderness...</p>
<p>Ah, you are holding the silver bell of joy,</p>

<h3 id="e57">Complaining <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Mozhi</p>
<p>Young people should be stronger, able to endure hardship, and bear the pain.</p>
<p>Why have we lost this courage that we should possess?</p>
<p>Having not seen each other for years, we unexpectedly meet today. To dispel our lonely feelings, we resort to the ridiculous act of complaining to each other, making the most of this rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Besides pouring out our material and spiritual suffering, besides engaging in aimless pleasantries, besides filling awkward silences with giggles…</p>
<p>What else could allow us to better handle this rather sudden opportunity to talk? It would be better to take such a rare opportunity to thoroughly scrub away the brands of life deeply etched into our hearts. You talk about yours, I talk about mine. Thinking about all of this afterward, it's truly meaningless, but at the time, we were quite serious, even comparing who had it worse, arguing over who was more optimistic or pessimistic.</p>
<p>In these years filled with the smoke of war, young companions are unable to ignite the courage of their youth in the flames. As a result, they are cast into these dark,沉沉 corners, enduring the lashes of life, struggling, hesitating, hoping, and also despairing. Who can avoid having a belly full of complaints in such a situation?</p>
<p>Young people should be stronger, able to endure hardship, and bear the pain. That is what should be, but if we already have so many complaints and constantly force them down, is that a solution? Besides, we usually have no way to complain; we are filled with grief but have no choice but to endure it ourselves.</p>
<p>Then, today, this unexpected opportunity to vent the endless bitterness buried in our hearts—it is quite liberating.</p>
<p>The complaining of young people is ultimately different from that of middle-aged and elderly people. Middle-aged people’s complaints are full of cunning worldliness, while elderly people are merely filled with pity and lamentation.</p>
<p>Young people, however, are unprincipled; they merely vent. Once they realize that complaining is useless and that everything must be solved by themselves, we have hands, brains, and the courage to live. We hope that we will not be worn down by life's trials and lose our passion. We can: endure hardship and bear the pain!</p>
<p>With this self-confidence, then, people who have finished complaining to each other, regain your youthful vitality and tread more practically on the rough paths of life that have caused so many wounds.</p>

<p>The sorrow of parting—it stirs up your tears, which cling to your eyelashes like rain threads clinging to a spider's web; your face wears an indelible bitter smile!</p>
<p>Like the delicate sun through the fog,</p>
<p>A melancholic shadow piled thickly.</p>
<p>Dare I say this is the last handshake?</p>
<p>Your fingertips are no warmer than piano keys; loneliness seals your trembling lips,</p>
<p>Grievously spelling out an indefinite "farewell."</p>
<p>Counting the vibrant days of youth,</p>
<p>Just as the train is about to reach its final destination;</p>
<p>It is good to retrieve them from the aging wrinkles in our memory,</p>
<p>Precisely when time has completely devoured us.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Football League Division A: Union to Battle Portuguese Merchants This Morning; Captain Xu Speaks of Firm Resolve to Win <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Football League Division A has reached its final crucial stage. Today at 10 AM, the Union team will battle the Portuguese Merchants at the Racecourse, essentially a championship decider. A lively scene can be expected on Jing'an Road. On the day of this major battle, we will discuss various aspects of this match.</p>
<p>Future Trends Based on Both Teams' Records</p>
<p>In Division A, besides the above two teams, the Overseas Chinese United Association has lost twice, losing four points. The Tung Wah team has lost three times, losing six points. The other teams have lost even more points. None of the aforementioned teams have any hope of winning the championship. Only the Union team has drawn twice, while the Portuguese Merchants have lost once. Both teams are in the best shape, holding the top spots. Today's battle will undoubtedly be decisive. If the Portuguese Merchants win today, they still have a match against Jilin, which they should be able to win easily. Conversely, if the Union team wins today, they have two matches against Tung Wah and Jilin. Winning against Jilin shouldn't be a problem, and Tung Wah will surely give them a break. Then, the Union team can win the championship. The importance of this battle for the championship is evident.</p>
<p>Both Sides Have Their Strengths</p>
<p>Analyzing both sides' strengths, let's start with the Union team. This team is known for its defensive characteristics on the field. Center back Song Jiansheng's clear dribbling is rare among players from other teams. Left and right midfielders Bi Fujin and Guo Yingzhong also have good skills and plenty of energy. This defensive line can be considered solid. On the defensive end, left back Li Tiansheng has attended the World Games, possessing rich experience. Although he is older, his charm doesn't fade, and his battlefield prowess is no less than in his younger years. Right back Wu Qixiang is recently in top form; his skill is unmatched in Shanghai. His quick feet and good positioning are impressive. With his energy restored, he displays his abilities fully and flawlessly. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan is of average quality. As a result, the Union team's forwards have rarely left a good impression on people. However, this season, with the return of young players Luo Shoufu and Gao Xiuqing, they are striving to improve. Zhou Qilin has also made progress. Consequently, the Union team's front line has become outstanding. Thus, the Union team has become a strong team with excellent offense and defense. The Portuguese Merchants have a considerable history in Shanghai's football scene. Most of the Portuguese players have resided in Shanghai for many years. Therefore, they are exceptionally familiar with the tactics of Chinese teams, enabling them to surprise their opponents. It is especially valuable that the team has intelligence, strategy, and a meticulous style of play, and they are adept at exploiting opponents' weaknesses. On the front line, Bao Xiutuo is the central figure, while the two wings, Fu En V Su Ruo, the former has the highest speed and the latter the clearest ball control and is skilled at crossing. These three are dangerous figures. Among the Portuguese Merchants' center backs, center back Oliveira has the demeanor of a general. Right midfielder A. Ke Lasha is brave but lacks intelligence. Left midfielder Kao Sitan has multiple skills but lacks stamina, so he is not ideal. Defender Ke Lai Tuo is better than Vik Tai. Although Vik Tai has a long history, some people praise him, but I feel he is old and useless, and utterly uncouth, lacking the temperament of a cultured general. Goalkeeper Bo Liman occasionally delivers outstanding performances but lacks consistency. Overall, both sides have their strengths.</p>
<p>It's Hard to Predict the Outcome</p>
<p>Some say the Union team will win because they defeated the Portuguese Merchants 4-2 in the Welfare Cup. In the Union Cup, the Union team was able to overwhelm the strong Overseas Chinese United Association, which had heavily defeated the Portuguese Merchants. The Portuguese Merchants' defense is most afraid of the ferocity of Li Yichen and Zhou Qilin. This statement has its reasons. However, some say the Portuguese Merchants' forwards are sharp and good at deceptive tactics. The Union team's defense may not be able to stop them, so the Portuguese Merchants have a better chance of winning. This is another opinion. Given that this battle is related to the championship, both sides will strive to their utmost. The outcome is hard to predict before the match.</p>
<p>Chatting With Captain Xu About Tactics</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met with Union team captain Xu Wenkui and chatted about the team's recent situation and today's lineup. I will briefly describe it. According to him, the Union team is determined to win. The players have been training hard recently, but Liu Xianhan is recovering from a recent illness, so he lacks confidence. Song Lingsheng is busy with official duties and can't attend. The other players and Captain Xu have been practicing daily, and they are all in normal condition. The starting lineup will be: goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, defenders Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng, midfielders Zheng Yingquan, Song Lingsheng, and Qu Yongfu, forwards Xu Wenkui, Gao Baozheng, Li Yichen, Luo Taofu, and Zhou Qilin. The possible changes are that Luo Shoufu doesn't have Gao Xiuqing's recent form, so he will be replaced depending on the situation. If Xu himself feels physically weak, he will be replaced by Fei Chunzhao. If Liu Lianghan is not recovering well from his illness, then Zheng Yingzhong will be the goalkeeper, and Gao Baozheng will be in the midfield line. This shows that the team has considered all aspects, and they have high hopes for defeating the enemy. Captain Xu also talked about tactics. He said that the Portuguese Merchants' most worrisome tactics are wing attacks and central breakthroughs. Therefore, our side will have Qu Yongfu tightly marking Qu Fuen and Wu Qixiang guarding Ding Su Ruo. Qu and Wu are in excellent condition, and they have the ability to do so. The Portuguese Merchants will find it difficult to attack on the wings, and their central breakthrough will be blocked by Song Ling, who is more than capable. If the opponent's attack is lacking, then our team will have more opportunities to attack. With their frequent progress, coupled with Li Yichen's powerful axe, which is difficult for the Portuguese players to resist, if all the players perform normally today, they will have the confidence to defeat the enemy.

<h3 id="e61">A Word for the Football Association: Training Should Be Given to Inspectors <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhihao</p>
<p>Since the Football Association changed personnel this year, the spirit of their work has improved compared to before. This is a fact that the sports community and people from all walks of life have witnessed. However, one point leaves me dissatisfied: to prevent spectators from entering without tickets, the association has hired a large number of inspectors to strictly collect tickets at the entrance. This is a necessary measure, but I have seen that most of the so-called inspectors are untrained ruffians, swaggering about, sometimes making unwarranted accusations against those with passes or player certificates. Conversely, they let in anyone they know. These inconsistencies are commonly seen by people in the know. According to me, in the match between Tung Wah and Huatong at Jiaoyuan, a certain inspector started an argument with me. He then led a large group of inspectors, seemingly wanting to fight me, and spoke rudely, completely untrained and uneducated. Football is a sport, an aspect of physical education, and the audience is also educated. If someone is insulted by an inspector while enjoying the skills of the game, wouldn't they be resentful? Therefore, I dare to express my humble opinion: I urge the Football Association authorities to give these inspectors strict training to demonstrate the value of physical education. I hope the authorities do not neglect the details and do not betray my sincerity.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Worth Introducing: Three Female Basketball Stars (Skinny Reporter) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The women's basketball scene has unexpectedly flourished this year. Shen Bao has found that the third basketball league has given the audience the impression that veteran players are not regressing, and there are many new players. Previously, this publication published "Two Topics on Female Artists." Based on my personal observations, there are three more heroines that deserve to be written about. Without considering my literary talent, I want to encourage the female players. I heard that the Dahua Sports Association is planning to organize a women's league. I hope the heroines of the city will continue to make progress and raise the level of the sport.</p>
<p>Nie Baozhu</p>
<p>Nie Baozhu is the cornerstone of the Xuebai team's defense and is a high-achieving student at Minli Girls' High School. Recalling Xuebai's first battle against the Yuan team, Miss Nie did not show any timidity despite facing a strong opponent. Her left block and interception made the Yuan team wary. She is excellent at occupying a standing position on the court. Therefore, although she does not have the best elasticity, she still deserves nine out of ten. More praiseworthy is that Miss Nie can always fight seriously and is not affected by winning or losing. Therefore, she has shown improvement in every match. If she continues to work hard, Miss Nie can be compared to the best defender in Shanghai, Miss Wang Weizhen. Let her strive!</p>
<p>Wu Meiyi</p>
<p>The Yikang team is a newly emerging team, but their record is quite impressive. Miss Wu is the captain of the team, playing as a left defender. She is skilled and not inferior to the average veteran. The reporter clearly remembers in the second round of the match between the team and the Yuan team, she was responsible for guarding Miss Huang Mingyuan. In the first half, she played to her abilities, and Yikang did not lose many points. Unfortunately, she could not continue to play in the second half due to physical reasons, and then Miss Huang's performance was seen again. This is enough to prove that Wu's skills are indeed good. Wu's advantages are her lively body, fast running, agile evasion, and accurate passing. She has these basic conditions of a basketball player, and her future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Yan Weiwen</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago, the Qixiu Women's Basketball Team was famous on the court, and Miss Yan was already an excellent forward for the team. However, at that time, she was young, so there were fewer highlights. Later, due to the lack of activities in women's basketball, there was no opportunity to see the heroines' skills. Recently, with the revival, Miss Yan made a comeback and joined the Yuan team. Her figure has developed with age, becoming a standard center. Her skills have not faded due to prolonged inactivity, but seem more outstanding than before. The Yuan team's forwards are particularly moving, relying on Yan's center's strategy. She has a great mind for dribbling. Her accurate mid-range shooting and aesthetic appearance make her an unparalleled center talent in Shanghai's women's basketball. She always maintains a friendly attitude and a sweet smile on her face during the game, a worthy model for athletes.</p>

<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>(3) Feint A feint is a technique used to deceive the opponent, making it difficult to know the attacking target at once. This feinting action can be done with the hands, feet, body, eyes, mouth, etc. It can be done alone or in combination, and it can vary with the person's hearing, understanding, and experience, but it must be performed generously and purely. It is most often used when throwing a boundary ball, when facing a close defender, when dribbling with the ball while being guarded by an enemy, when shooting after dribbling, when encountering an enemy in front, or when an enemy approaches to defend after receiving the ball. In short, feints can be used at any time, but do not use the same kind often, and it must have the right timing to be effective, otherwise, it will inevitably lead to unnecessary actions.</p>
<p>(4) Blocking The blocking method means that a teammate who does not have the ball uses various methods that do not infringe on the opponent to block the opponent's defensive route so that the teammate with the ball can obtain an attacking opportunity. For example, after A passes the ball to B, he immediately steps forward to block the enemy guarding B, so that B can dribble forward from behind A and shoot. This method is used most often when attacking in the front court, especially when both sides are densely packed. All teams that have undergone advanced training spend a considerable amount of time receiving this technical training. Modern basketball law mostly adopts the five-person joint defense and man-to-man strategy. The former is densely deployed in the enemy's court, and the latter is always tightly guarding the opponent. To break through these two defensive strategies, it is most effective to use the blocking method with the entire team attacking. It seems that Shanghai's teams are not accustomed to using this tactic. It is common to see players running after passing the ball, not knowing to immediately block the nearest enemy so that teammates can dribble and attack. If they run away, they will unknowingly give way to the enemy to step forward and intercept the teammate's ball. This shows that they do not know how to use the blocking method, and it is necessary to conduct special research and training.</p>
<p>Three: Basic Techniques of Individual Defense</p>
<p>In modern basketball, since the center circle jump ball has disappeared, due to various new tactics, fast attack and fast defense are mostly adopted, especially fast defense. Therefore, every player must accelerate their individual offensive and defensive techniques. Modern teams that are good at both offense and defense can control others. Otherwise, they will inevitably be controlled by others. In fact, in basketball tactics, being good at defense is better than being good at offense. When two strong teams meet and have the same offensive strength, the key to winning must lie in defensive techniques. Because a good defender will have more opportunities to get the ball and attack. However, most players are brave in attacking but neglect defense. It is common to see players spending 99% of their time studying attacking methods in practice, while rarely encountering defensive techniques. This is a big mistake. If the enemy is weak and we are strong, we can rely on the advantage of attacking skills to drive straight into the enemy. If the enemy is strong and we are weak, we will not be able to overcome the attack, nor will we be able to defend the retreat. Therefore, the art of offense and defense must be focused on strict defense, followed by offense.</p>
<p>(1) Defensive Hints</p>
<p>Players who are good at defense must always occupy the dominant position in guarding the enemy. Defend the inner circle, stand in the middle of the enemy and the basket, so that both the ball and the person can be taken care of at the same time, avoiding the unfavorable situation that occurs when the enemy uses the blocking method to attack. At the same time, it can also intercept the enemy's dribble, especially in the "man-to-man" defensive method. If both the ball and the person can be guarded at the same time, the most important thing at this time is to guard the person instead of the ball. If you only look at the ball and not the person, you will inevitably be escaped by the enemy using the feint, blocking, or rotation method. Therefore, in individual defensive techniques, you must first understand the importance of the position you stand, and then you can talk about other defensive methods.</p>
<p>(2) Correct Defense Method</p>
<p>The standing posture is very important for the correct defense method. The feet should be separated left and right, the knees should be slightly bent, the body should be slightly leaning forward, the arms should be open, and one hand should be raised horizontally to block the opponent's way. One hand should be raised high in front of the enemy, constantly waving to create a fierce stance to disrupt the opponent's line of sight, make them panic and confused, and make it difficult to shoot and pass, or lose the ball in a panic so that it can be seized. However, this standing posture must always maintain the balance of the body's center of gravity without losing control. The standing position should not be too close to the enemy, as it is easy to touch the body and commit a foul. It is also difficult to observe the enemy's movements, and it is easy for the opponent to use the feint method to confuse our line of sight. Or use a low pass, half-ball pass, or use a rotation evasion method to escape around the body. But you cannot be too far away from the enemy, as it will lose the defensive effect. You should stand about one yard away from the enemy, so that you can reach the ball they are holding in their chest. The method of guarding the enemy is not easy to leave the position until the enemy rushes forward. It is not easy to jump up and grab the ball until the enemy has shot the ball. If the enemy is holding the ball and starts to rush forward, you should first retreat, determine their passing or dribbling route, and then step forward to intercept. If the enemy is not holding the ball and rushes forward, you can follow their run,抢占 the inner關. You should run and force them close to the sideline, or trap them in the corner of the field, so that the route they take is longer and the area they can move is smaller. Never let them enter the inner circle and occupy a field closer to the basket than us. This is just a general statement, and you still need to refer to other defensive methods and use them in combination to adapt to various defensive situations.</p>
<p>(3) Defense Method After the Opponent Shoots</p>
<p>After the opponent shoots, the defensive method is that each defensive player should strictly defend the enemy they are guarding and must grab the inner group near the basket before the enemy, and drive the enemy out of the關, so that the enemy cannot easily follow up and shoot again. Even if the enemy can attack again, they must pass through our players and run. It is not easy to get close to the basket and score. Therefore, when the enemy shoots, you should not stare at the route of the ball, but should monitor the enemy, watch their feet, so that you can judge their actions and prepare for defense in advance.</p>
