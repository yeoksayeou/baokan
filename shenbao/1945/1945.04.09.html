<p>社評</p>
<h3>論日本新內閣</h3>
<p>盟邦日本小磯首相於本月五日提出總辭職後，即由鈴木大將奉命組織後繼內閣，着手銓衡閣員人選，七日下午全部決定，當晚舉行親任式。至此，為各方面擁護的新內閣正式組成。</p>
<p>在冲繩島戰局正在展開之際，盟邦內閣此次改組，敵方之惡意造謠，自所不免，因此，我們得特別指出此次日本內閣改組的眞實意義。</p>
<p>第一，日本內閣的改組，和日木國政方針，並不發生重大關聯。因為日本的某本國政方針，早已昭示於三十年十二月八日的「宣戰大詔」，這是任何內閣絕對遵守的國政方針，內閣人事的更迭，只在更適應環境，以更有效的辦法，去達成這一國政方針而已。回顧自大東亞戰爭以來，日本內閣經三次改組，但是其遵奉宣戰詔書以圖自存自衛解放東亞的國政方針，却始終一貫，可為明證。所以任何涉及日本國策轉變的臆測，毫無事實根據，不足置信的。</p>
<p>第二，盟邦鈴木新內閣的基本任務，完全在使政治集中於決戰，使統帥與國政更緊密的配合，以便將國家總力作最高度的發揮。回憶去年七月，小　首相繼東條內閣而擔負大政之時，即曾為一新人心完成戰爭而提出「大和一致」的口號，確立應付戰局的國民總蹶起體制，因此在八個多月以來，曾創設最高戰爭指導會議，最近更進而實施新政治體制，規定首相得出席大本營會議，使軍管區與地方協議會切合一致，這種措施，都在使國政與作戰緊密聯繫，以圖達成戰爭目的。現在內外局勢更形重大，要求舉國一致，集結總力，及加强國政與統帥部結合一體化，是更加迫切了，鈴木內閣，自將毅然負起這一重任，正如六日「朝日新聞」社評所說：「如何可使統帥與政務溶成一體，目下情勢，已極明顯。」這正是日本全國對鈴木內閣的期待，也是鈴木內閣施政的主要中心方針。</p>
<p>第三，盟邦新內閣是更强力的軍官民合作的內閣，也是舉國一致決戰內閣。因為，其成立一方面由陸海軍一致協力，一方面由最近成立的「舉國之政黨」大日本政治會總裁南次郞大將等盡力贊助，而參加這　新閣的，又都是日本朝野果敢有為人物，阿南及米內陸海二相以次，如廣瀨藏和、豐出軍需兼運通相、下村國務相兼情報局總裁諸氏，尤為深受民間愛戴久著德望者，六日「每日新聞」社評即指出：「二等一億國民，願大將以全力處理國政，擊潰敵人，完遂聖戰」，同日「讀賣新聞」社評也指出：「在展開本土決戰之今日，能由鈴木大將出而處理，實為我一億國民之啓切期待」，可以見盟邦全國人心所趨。所以我們可以斷言，盟邦這次成立的新內閣，必更能實現「大和一致」「一億一體」的口號，集結舉國總力，以適應內外新形勢。</p>
<p>由於日本此次新內閣的成立，不禁更有感認我國朝野各方任務的重大。國府陳代主席於七日談話中說：「本人深信新內閣必能以更堅强之陣容，推行國政之施策，遂行決戰。國民政府本於其求解放之目標，自當本於注先生遺志，以同生共死之決心，貫澈參戰初衷，努力邁進，以薪致大柬亞戰爭之完遂」，我們自當堅定信念，不受謠惑波動，與盟邦新內閣更取得密切聯繫，共同為爭取大東亞戰爭勝利而努力。</p>
<h3>國民政府宣戰佈吿</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日，大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方份子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第為友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益　狡謀，且　視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，嗾使渝方份子，不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方為根據，向我武漢廣州等處，屢施轟炸，殘害平民。在渝方份子，甘受英美驅使，躬為東亞叛逆，固屬可恥；而英美對於東亞處心積慮，　其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤為東亞民族所當同仇敵愾。國民政府為此宣吿，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻。凡我國民，當知此為實現　國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體正義和平之獲得，胥繫於此；其一心一德，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命。中華民國三十二年一月九日　主席汪兆銘</p>
<h3>關於國際機構之會議與重慶</h3>
<p>— 松平忠久</p>
<p>聯合國方面計劃在四月二十五日召開關於維持和平機構之會議，早已料到有此一着，然在克里米亞會議時決定會議之地點與時期，認係羅斯福之提案，英蘇兩國僅順其意思而已，此因不難想像者。吾人推察美國所以要擇定此時期與地點之理由，第一是想誇示美國指導的地位，第二企圖對日本加以政治上的壓迫，關於其眞相如何，業經岸情報部長著文批評，此次會議討論中心問題，為鄧巴頓奧克斯會談時決定之「關於戰後一般的國際機構之提案」。據該會談結束後去年十月十日路透社華盛頓電報所稱：鄧巴頓奧克斯會談之決定事項，美國政府已送交聯合國，待將來聯合國召開全體正式會議時再提出討論，並擬草成國際機構之憲章。但鄧巴頓奧克斯會談中，所有未決定事項決定由英美蘇三國巨頭會談而得政治上的解決後，再召開國際會議，是以早已料到必有此次會議之召開。所以欲知舊金山會議之內情，須先檢討鄧巴頓奧克斯之決議事項，同時欲知此會議於東亞諸民族有如何影響，則必須明瞭英美以如何之態度對付重慶，以下為根據最近資料加以若干解說：</p>
<p>鄧巴頓奧克斯會談之始末</p>
<p>此次大戰，軸心國之戰爭目的，在德國言：是要打破不合理不公平之凡爾賽體制，建設歐洲新秩序，於日本言，要使東亞諸民族，從英美荷支配下解放出來，俾完成各民族之獨立，以建設東亞新秩序。反之，英美並不向世界表示其眞正之戰爭目的，大西洋憲章雖然闡明英美對世界政治之方針，主要內容以尊重自由主義為主，但英美兩國行動較諸憲章竟背道而馳，世界各國視大西洋憲章為英美利己主義之表現，於此英美痛感須立即造成使世界各國民接受之世界政策，一方面粉飾其戰爭目的，一方面使他國對抗日本大東亞政策，於是動員國內國際法學者及御用團體等，硏究國際政治機構。</p>
<p>對此項硏究美國最為熱心，去年五月下旬商獲成案，即以此送交英蘇渝。八月下旬英美蘇及英美渝舉行非正式會談，十月九日擬成「關於戰後一般的國際機構之提案一，為何美國對此種硏究表示非常熱意，自身先行提倡，其理由不難想像。蓋美國之戰爭目的向不明確，在上次大戰時，威爾遜因國會反對，不能參加國際聯盟，暴露國內不統一之事實，故此次再不蹈覆轍，必須謀妥國內的措置。</p>
<p>該會談之特徵</p>
<p>此次會談，並非英美蘇渝四國代表緊集一處舉行，乃係根據蘇聯意思，先由英美蘇三代表討論，商得成案後，英美再依據此成案與渝方代表會談，斟酌重慶意思加以決定，重慶不過是暗客而已。</p>
<p>英美蘇會談，當時料想經過二三星期必能結束，惟嗣以蘇聯準備不充分，申請延期，結果展期一星期，於八月二十一日開會，且英美蘇間意見發生對立，蘇聯代表格洛柯每一事件須向本國政府請訓受其指示，故會談進行極緩，經過六星期後，意見始漸吿一致。</p>
<p>但英美渝會談，渝方雖有提案，均為英美所反對，會期僅旬日，草草了事。</p>
<p>此次會談之性質，據赫爾稱為非正式的，討論問題不包括政治經濟及軍事，將來開舊金山會議時，各國代表或將不加考慮承認此成案，抑或議論百出，總之，難以判斷。法國特戈爾政府至今猶疑惑不決，亦因恐懼此案，實際上將拘束各國自由之故，英美是否接受法方修正提案，如果不然，則法國將決不參加，此對各小國命運極有重大影響。</p>
<p>該會談決定之內容</p>
<p>據去年十月九日公布者，鄧巴頓奧克斯會談決定之內容，全文共計十二章，嗣後再據片斷的情報，各章細目規定亦經明悉，列舉之其大綱如次：第一章宗旨，第二章原則，第三章盟約國，第四章主要機關，第五章總會，第六章安全保障理事會，第七章國際司法裁判所，第八章為維持國際和平與安寗而謀侵略之防止及抑制，第九章處理各國間經濟及社會的協助，第十章事務局。第十一章修正手續，第十二章經過的處理。</p>
<p>此國際機構之名稱決定為「國際聯合」，但實質上與國際聯盟所不同者：　國際聯合理事會保障安全之權限，較國際聯盟理事會權限為強，其中常務理事國（大國）之權限更大，故總會之權限極見縮小。　為防止或抑制侵略設置軍事委員會及國際空軍，此外不設特別軍隊，由常務理事國軍隊擔任防止或抑制侵略。　小國在形式上依平等主權原則亦為總會之組織份子，但比較國際聯盟，實際上並無權力。</p>
<p>其次，會談至最後猶未能決定者為安全保障理事會之表決權，各國對一般的原則意見，似已一致，即一切決定須得理事國全部同意，但理事國中之一國成為紛爭當事國時，紛爭當事國不能參加表決（英美渝主張），或仍能參加表決（蘇聯主張）。此問題表面上似乎僅係手續上問題，但實際上為重大之政治問題也。結果蘇聯疑心國際聯合或將形成組織反蘇十字軍的媒介機關，故始終固執成見，而英美方面疑心蘇聯在世界各地推進強力政策，是否在造成旣成事實，故始終堅持關於侵略國之決定權。（請參閱岸情報部長之「幻夢般的舊金山會議」）但此問題，在克里米亞會談時大致已依照蘇聯主張通過，故美上議院溫德伯，英自由黨議員皮佛利基，及哈里斯，勞工黨議員台維斯等，認為大國不受國際聯合之拘東，僅小國受拘束，實屬不合理，要求對此點加以修正。預料舊金山會議，亦將因此點而發生相當問題。</p>
<p>鄧巴頓奧克斯會談重慶之態度</p>
<p>鄧巴頓奧克斯會談重慶派　維鈞出席，似並將獨自提案交其帶走，重慶提案與其他提案不同，而特別引起吾人興趣者，計有下列各點：</p>
<p>國際聯盟設置國際警察軍</p>
<p>為防止侵略起見，企圖設置直屬於國際聯盟之國際警察軍，然遭各國之反對未被通過。</p>
<p>特定殖民地由國際管理</p>
<p>在國際聯盟之下設置國際委員會，將某特定殖民地由國際管理，將來對殖民地住民予以指導，以使發展為自治國，或獨立國，此種思想與委任統治制度相近，似　　有理想主義的體裁，重慶意圖將華僑衆多的南洋日軍佔領地域採取此種形態，然而此提案亦為各國反對，而遭否決。</p>
<p>樹立人種平等之原則</p>
<p>據去年九月十五日華盛頓合衆社電　重慶代表曾要求承認在將來國際機構中之人種平等原則，然英美認為並不適當，而加以反對云。又合衆社電，反加以說明稱，人種平等之原則案，曾於一九一九年前大戰之講和會議中討論國際聯盟規約時，由日本提出，而此次由重慶提出同樣陷於被拒絕命運，實係奇妙的因緣，久贊成人種平等原則之蘇聯，於鄧巴頓奧克斯會談，竟未能會晤一堂，亦係其妙之因綠云。</p>
<p>以上重慶提案中，第二票與第三項為代表東亞的思想，尤其第三項之人種平等原則與大東亞宣言第五原則相合致，實為重慶猶未失去大東亞思想的證據，極感興味。此項提案均為英美所反對，固屬必然，而在重慶總不免　然若失吧，由此亦可證明重慶發言權之如何微妙。</p>
<p>舊金山會議與各國之態度</p>
<p>據稱：舊金山會議已對卅九國發出邀請書，傳克里米亞會談，曾決定在三月一日以前，未向軸心國布吿宣戰之國際，並無參加該會議之資格，故南美六國遂即布吿宣戰。又近來之土耳其：埃及·叙利亞·黎巴嫩·伊朗等亦為英美所强逼而慌忙向軸心國宣戰，以獲得參加此會議之資格</p>
<p>法之特戈爾政府，曾被認為邀請國之一、然而上項理由，拒絕參加，旋經英美方面多方努力，傳至最近，始允派遣代表出席會議。義大利之波諾米政府，雖為英美所一手造成，然決定不令參加致招渡諾米政府之不滿。最奇怪者，乃為叙利亞及黎巴嫩，雖經布吿宣戰，而未被准許正式參加，經特戈爾之調　，始予列席旁瞧、該二國其內心之憤慨，當可推想而知。</p>
<p>鄧巴頓奧克斯之國際聯盟案，初未送交阿根廷，瑞士瑞典·西班牙·葡萄牙，阿根廷最近被强逼宣戰而吿屈服，西班牙不得已對日斷交，以上各國均不參加。又此外波關阿富汗等亦未接受邀請書，故均不出席，波闌等均表示相當憤恨。</p>
<p>再就參加國之意向來觀，所可注意者乃英美二國均竭力希望多帶同黨出席會議，以增厚勢力，如美國隨有拉丁阿美利加及南美十九國與里比亞並菲律賓，英國則擁有屬領國代表，歐洲之比利時·荷闌·挪威·希臘四國，近東之土耳其·埃及·阿剌伯·伊朗·伊拉克五國，共計十四代表，此外捷克及南斯拉夫亦一半可稱為英國之同伴。</p>
<p>反之，蘇聯之態度，則完全不同，上　之南斯拉夫及捷克，其中雖可為蘇聯効力，此外，則此次決不帶一切屬黨，羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·芬闌至少可以蘇聯屬黨形成參加舊金山會議，事實並不如此，此究為蘇聯採取不使對外活動之方針，抑為英美因此三國國境不確定及政情不安定而藉口反對參加，則殊難明瞭，大致係尊重蘇聯意見而決定，今次不參加當可不難想像。蓋蘇聯要求准予自國之烏克蘭及白俄羅斯聯邦代表參加會議，英已予承認，而美亦在相互條件之　，終予接受，故此次決定准許該項代表出席。由此項事實而觀，可知蘇聯意圖造成必腹屬黨而被一併出席會議，殊為明顯。又蘇聯斡旋波蘭魯布林政府參加會議，乃為企圖造成事實之提案，而為英美所拒絕，會議召集前，英美對共聯之因舊金山會議而起之關係，極為微妙。此外，美蘇間引起問題者乃美蘇協議，決定各派正式代表三名出席會議，然因其他方面之反對，美國突於四月二日變更三名派遣代表之方針，由國務卿聲明改為一名，致使蘇聯驚慌失措。</p>
<p>舊金山會議之重慶立塲</p>
<p>重慶未曾被邀請出席克里米亞會談，然向來對於英美蘇決定事項唯唯服從，故今次亦派代表出席。但事前羅斯福要求國共二黨打成一片，派出代表，於是以宋子文為團長，除選定顧維　·王寵惠·胡適等第一流人物外，加以中共代表董必武，各黨代表張君勱，李璜等以避國民黨專制色彩。</p>
<p>英美蘇三國之內已成立諒解，英國由加拿大·澳洲·印度·南菲等各殖民地選出正式代表，美蘇亦各派正式代表各三人，然對於重慶則未與此種資格，縱令重慶有此資格派出正式代表三人，然以中共代表與宋子文顧維鈞同等待遇，在國內關係雖不可能，故其處境頗為困難。各國均任命外交部長階級之人物為代表，然重慶以行政院長之宋子文為團長，並以其他外交界之第一流之顧維鈞·王寵惠·胡適·魏道明等為其隨員，此事與蘇聯僅以駐美大使格洛柯為主席代表之事比較，恰如派大人出席兒童會議，令人發生頗奇怪之感想。然則重慶為何派幾達五十人之隨員，據吾人觀察，其有如下兩種理由：</p>
<p>第一，朱子文無心腹隨員，又無派出正式代表三人之資格，故在其隨員之中，加多有外交部長經騐者三人以上，以圖整頓威容。</p>
<p>第二，想像雅爾達會談決定歐洲問題，故今次會議必有太平洋政治問題之決議，然則重慶亦均霑其利益，即以得隴望蜀之野心，特派多數隨員以備個別說服英美蘇。</p>
<p>由大東亞地域參加舊金山會議者，僅有重慶及菲律賓之奧斯米尼亞政府，尤其後者未得任何國家之承認，而美國要求派代表出席，實可證明今次會議不少勉强之事實，而此等二政府並非代表東亞全體，不過為一萬數千萬亞洲人之代表而已，因此重慶故意派多數隨員以張聲勢，亦未可知。重慶擬在舊金山會議再度提出殖民地之國際管理案及人種平等原則，然美國　已聲明，今次會議不討論殖民地問題與歐洲國境問題。至於人種平等原則，必為英美所反對，故以重慶現在之力量，決不能主張任何獨自之提案，殊為明顯。重慶企圖利用此會議，以防止由亞洲西北方而之威脅，故如有關於侵略之定義及防止辦法，及同情小國之提議時，將必堅　贊成意見，以謀本身國際關係之有利。</p>
<p>總而言之，重慶應當覺悟　與日本提携決不能在世界政治舞合得其成功。又重慶將必察知今次會議及美國帝國主義為其利己政策所支配，其所派代表必將掃興而歸，此固可逆　者也。</p>

<h3>今十六次防空日　實施綜合訓練　市民應注意各項防空要點</h3>
<p>今（九）日為第十六次防空日。市民防空本部循例擴大宣傳防空意義及實施各項防空訓練。茲將詳情分茲如次，務眾市民協力，遵照各項辦法實施訓練。</p>
<p>警報訓練</p>
<p>其訓練警報之時間，業經於前日各報詳細記載，届時並不吹鳴汽笛，惟於訓練警報發令中，倘還有實際上應發警報之情事時，仍當鳴吹汽笛，民眾應注意及之。至於警報之傳達，為須預防警報之障礙，幫對警報之傳達詞後於警報之發令及解體，決定全市均以銅鑼或其他金屬物代替，其打法為：</p>
<p>警戒警報發令打三聲。</p>
<p>空襲警報發令亂打。</p>
<p>緊急待避之通知亦亂打。</p>
<p>空襲警報解除打三聲。</p>
<p>警戒警報解除又打二聲。訓練時打法亦相同，其司　者於任何地方須帶口頭傳達，其打三聲與二聲之間，須隔五秒至十秒左右以資認别。</p>
<p>同時全市揭示警報標旗，其辦法為：</p>
<p>警戒警報發令藍色旗。</p>
<p>空襲警報發令紅色旗。</p>
<p>空襲警報解除藍色旗，須至警戒警報解除，始將標旗卸除，訓練警報則於各色標旗上均另系黄色小旗。</p>
<p>局地訓練</p>
<p>此次為第三次局地總配置訓練，由華山長密兩分局在該兩管轄區內實施，是項局地訓練，須使全管內各户全部市民參加旅行訓練，俾於非常時家庭防空得以奏效。查過去是項訓練成績，僅為參加演練場所及有限之防空從業人員反复實施而已，與局地訓練之根本精神，不相符合，應予改善，嗣後實施時應注意：</p>
<p>實施場所應遮斷全部交通。</p>
<p>對每户內須適應該户內之狀況，舉行狀況表演，並動員户內全部人員實施訓練。</p>
<p>於各户各　准備非常用水，考慮火點與水源之距離，實施對於每個火點運搬約一擔水量之訓練，放水完了後不容間斷，立即依次變更設想采取敏速行動之訓練。</p>
<p>參加動員之防空人員，應注重發揮其機動性，家庭防空須極力昂揚，以除留之婦女老幼擔任家庭防護。</p>
<p>防空訓練當日應避免不急不需要之外出，並務使全部人員函義參加訓練之意職。</p>
<p>雖不需統一之防空服裝，惟全部人員應穿着便於活動之服裝，對不肯穿着者應采取適當之警告辦法。</p>
<p>不宜參加防空活動者，須預為實施甚避難之編制訓練。</p>
<p>住户不在之房屋，系延燒之尊源，故須絕對避免居戾外出。</p>
<p>華山長密兩分局，應將此次訓練有關各點預使管內市民澈底周知，當日愚園路及長密路為界限，分為二區，北部地區自上午十時起凡二小時，南部地區自下午二時起二小時，連續强行澈底之各種綜合訓練。</p>
<p>其他訓練</p>
<p>交通管制：於下午二時半訓練空襲警報發令時，全市實施戰格之交通管制，除動員全部警察官外，並召集保甲防空人員協助，對步行者及不設非常標識之一切車輛，一律遵照規定辦法，以便澈底實施交通管制，如還予以處分。</p>
<p>燈火管制，下午八時半於訓練空襲警報發令時，務須澈底實行空襲燈火管制，對還犯者立即加以查封，由分局長裁定處以十日以內之停電處分，而對故意還犯者應呈請長期停止供電，對於汽車三輪車人力車及其他車輛之燈火管制，尤須特别留意，以期消減還犯者。過去雖頭及其他屋外燈光之取締，成績極為不良，故對於電燈以外之漏光應加没收，並依照還警罰則處以五日以內之拘留處分，俾增强防空之實施。</p>
<p>同時於下午四時訓練空襲警報發令時，須依照計劃對各區工廠實施防空訓練，及實施消火待避，救護或其他種綜合訓練。</p>
<h3>川本陸軍部長　招待新聞界</h3>

<h3>德國的空襲對策</h3>
<p>自從漢堡大空襲以來，在成為焦土的柏林市內奪門的德國，其措置實多借　之處。茲就食糧住屋疏散救護金融德端分别述之：</p>
<p>食糧</p>
<p>關於食糧，其事前對策，凡位於空襲危險地帶的大都市，其食糧的貯藏量應減到最低限度，而利用郊外周圍小都市的既有設備，分散貯藏之。各州糧食局常時保有地方别食糧現存額，空襲時地方食品糧不敷時即由州方彌補之，萬一仍不夠，則由　州接濟，並於全國擇定敷處，以空襲危險地帶人口的五分之一為標准，貯食糧於食庫，此外還有國防軍貯藏的食糧，亦可通　，組織頗為廣大。</p>
<p>至其事後對策，空襲以後，由NSV（國空社會主義勝利團）　　難市民复與工作者分　一星期無票口糧，並於音樂會空襲被害食券時分發咖啡，上等白蘭地。更進一步對一般市民亦實施（空襲特配），特對配一次肉，咖啡，酒，意在酬謝市民奮戰。自去年年初以來，柏林市內，對於可得食糧配給的證明書所有者，幾乎經常旅行和軍隊相同的特配，借此鼓舞市民的鬥志。</p>
<p>至於食糧以外的物資，危險地帶以外貯藏應急修理用建業資材，修補，隊具，被服等的食庫，如其所藏不敷應用，則由經濟部的食庫接濟。此種分散的貯藏品，如要隨時圓滑應用，運輸機關的健全，自為第一要務。至其事後對策，則由NSV補給，無須購買說的被服和食器類等日用品，並提前配給其他物資。此外，更配給煤斤等燃料，以代因空襲而缺少煤氣。</p>
<p>住屋</p>
<p>依據住宅供給令，因疏散都市人口而多餘的空屋及各市民所有房屋的（間數和人數），均徹底加以調查，由此以便將住宅供給空襲灾民，疏散的户口，其在柏林的住宅須交由NSV管理。適用住宅供給令的建築物，大體為：</p>
<p>一，非生活本據的建築物。</p>
<p>二，有房間多餘的住户。</p>
<p>三，使用目的非戰時性質者。</p>
<p>大抵適用那些房屋很大而居住人口不多的邸宅。都市人口的强制疏散，以原籍何處歸還何處為原則，實行集團的疏散，由NSV的仲介，為他們高潮我人等房屋。而行李的運輸等，也一切由NSV包辦。</p>
<p>此外，在都市郊外用鋼骨水泥大規模建築耐火的小住宅，供備灾市民居住。並充分利用破壞或焚燒一半的房屋，修理後再予使用。市政當局對於此類房屋的修理，務使其足蔽風雨。空襲後，對於房屋　者，先令其暫避於指定的建築物，然後迅速提供避難住宅。</p>
<p>醫療</p>
<p>除學校，旅館等建築物，在空襲危險地區以外，复設置所有（疏散病院），以便將負傷者運至該處靜待診治。同時加强醫院的地下室，施以防彈防火設備。此類防空病室，雖在空襲時亦可實行任何大手術。除此以外，還有托特工作隊建設成功的地下病院，這是最合理想的。此種擁有地下防彈防火設備的病院，能眾六　重的大炸彈，堅固異常。</p>
<p>至於防空救護期，則不斷由受過救護訓練的人組成，工廠及公司等的救護組尤其活躍。德國此種救護班的特色，就是救出和救護全由同一個人實行，所以救出之後當場就可施以急救治療。</p>
<p>金融</p>
<p>空襲時，銀行及郵政儲金局照常辦理付款事宜，因此銀行在任何僻備鄉村皆設分行或辦事處，負責支付存款。儲款的支付手續非常簡便，存款簿如果遺失或毁壞，也只要查照原　之後就可付款，烘幹的鈔票，只要可以辨别它是鈔票，立刻可以掉換新票。（譯自三月七日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>西區自警大隊　昨舉行檢閱</h3>
<p>本市華山路長密路兩保甲區模範自警團，自經統一編製後，業於昨（八）日上午正式成立區大隊，保甲處長顧繼武檢閱，上午九時半，兩區模範自警大隊即集中於梵皇渡路聖約翰大學大草地上，顧處準時蒞場檢閱，完畢後，由長密總聯保長周少白致詞，報告模範自警團編組經過，經由顧處長致訓，語多昂勉，旋由長密主任委員沈嗣良致詞，中午十二時始果。</p>
<h3>由上海至蘇北</h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>戰前上海與蘇北沿江各口均有定期輪船往來，直達天生港，張黃港，口岸，揚州等地，交通極為便利。目前交通工具缺乏，雖　尺之地，如同天涯。現將該路最近交通情形，略述於後，以供返鄉者之參攷：</p>

<p>帆船　　五福行——設六合路（前勞合路）三六弄六號電話九三八五四，經理張鏡清。現有大帆船七·八隻，直放南通姚港及海門　積洪，停船地為新閘橋西首華商紗布交易所倉庫門首蘇州河邊。開行時間十日起為每晨八時，水程由蘇州河轉黃浦江，再折入長江西駛，在天黑之前即可抵達姚港。其船小者容客三四十人，大者一百人左右。行李可多帶，其船費爲每人八千，行李每件水腳千元以內。該行受通·如·崇·海·啓旅滬同鄉會之委託，協助疏散同鄉，凡貧苦而有同鄉會之證明文件者，得按其程度減半收費，　完全免收。</p>
<p>公路　　達德聯運社——設於武定路一一〇號，中區接洽處爲西　路大陸飯店一一四號室。路綫是從上海　汽車出發，　嘉定·太倉至常熟。再北駛至福山港，改搭該社特備之小汽輪直駛對江之姚港，此綫主要路程全在陸路，沿途閘卡較多。上海至福山港需時約七八小時，福山至姚港之江面有三十多里，渡江亦需二三小時，當天尚可到達。該社現有租來之小汽車三輛，每逢星期三·六晨八時開車。每人之票價爲四萬元，且大件行李不便携带。</p>

<p>鐵道　又有一線就是赴揚州等地之正路，即從上海乘火車到鎮江，再搭汽輪過江至揚州或高郵等地，唯火車搭乘不易，且所費極品，旅客苦之。</p>
<p>以所述行駛帆船諸線，雖沿途關卡較少，但於江面行駛時，亦偶有遇刦事件，今後除增強防衛力外，幾無其他防禦方法。又船隻載貨越量或乘客太多，亦往往釀成大禍，故管理方面，宜嚴加注意。</p>

<h3>大學生昨舉行　防犯演講比賽</h3>
<p>上海學生防犯研究委員會主辦市警察局第三處防犯科贊助之（防犯演講比賽大會），已於昨（八）日晨九時在大上海大戲院舉行，到有警局第三處長李時雨，暨各科長主任以及教育界代表大中學學生來實等千餘人，先由李處長致詞，將防犯之真意詳加闡述，對大學生熱烈研究防犯工作，甚表感謝及欣慰，惟望各同學研究防犯理論時，更須求其實際工作，始能收穫功效。詞畢即開始比賽，由張璨光，劉紹魁，島承讓，吳錫光，周光輝，楊雖時擔任評判員，參加比賽者有朱少坤，胡志愚，李綃賢，陳海境，梅文，吳傳甲，裴國琛，胡周增，苗正義，林嘉木，系運杭等男女十一人，各人對防犯之意義及辦法均有所發揮，結果復旦大學高材生胡同增，榮獲冠軍，請題為（防犯工作與少年感化教育），亞軍為國立上海高學院女高材生裴國琛，請題為（防犯與生活），第三各二人，為上海大學高材生胡志愚，請題為（現代都會與防犯工作），華東大學女高材生陳海培，請題為（怎樣防止兒童犯罪），繼由李處長給獎，最後開映防犯電影（回頭是岸），至一時許始畢。</p>
<h3>本市上周間　金融變動劇烈　物價仍平衡市况清明</h3>
<p>本市金融市況，最後一周依然有劇烈波浪，周初因多頭觀望不前，承前周漲風餘波，散戶稍有推脫之勢，市況未見演進。周二頓時有力者傾吐，且以拋空塵埃益助，人心風疲，　赤公債及華股買風突起，市價一致傾跌，大有江河日下之勢。周三上午行清仍然不振，下午則傳有利多頭消息，即轉回漲之勢，惟一般人心未能確證其實，表風稍敢。這周四消息證實，人心大為振奮，擁資者竟相吸收　赤公債及股票，周五更甚，兩日間重展空前漲風、周六上午半日市面，初平繼挺終又同平，一周內金融之變動漲跌相跑有天壤之別，　赤有二百萬元之上落，最高價會海至六百二十開頭上，公債起伏亦有四千元至一萬之高低。華股中永安，美亞，中華書局等三熱門股，則有三百元至一千元上落，先有三十餘種股票跌停板，後有六十餘種股票漲停板，可知其演變情形之烈。此種金融變動之主因雖由國際局勢，激動一般般機者活動，但一般人心轉變投機目標，而以多數遊資華趙黃金公債股票，確為一大主因。故觀近一周金融之變化劇烈，而工商各業之貨物買賣異常清開，除民生有關之日用必需品有成交外，其他各頭非必需品可謂問津乏人，此亦可表示囤積物資日衡，人民購買力減低，故而最近物價平海　低，足見過去物價之勝漲確為人為的原因，希望經濟主管當局當密注視，以防再度造成惡果。</p>
<h3>支票退票商訂取蹄辦法</h3>

<p>馬公愚演說，謂本人幼年身體最弱，自經習太極拳以來，已盡十載，十年之中，不打針，不服藥，每日作書十二小時，毫無倦容。本人望六之年，而人視我，願如四十許人，自謂當是得力於太極拳之故。今日之自太極拳者，必推楊家，然必由　派傳授，而後始能窺其堂　，此猶學書必宗種王，而必有真跡，以供　　，而後始獲其神韻，傳種文君，系永年楊澄甫先生之外孫，自幼親承外祖傳授，家學澗源，不同凡響。某年楊澄甫先生　悒，本人與有一面之緣，並親見其表演，覓其種種手法，決非常人所能望其項背。諸君今日獲得　君為師，殊為不易云云。最後由尊師傳變文闡述楊家太極拳，至為祥盡。並勉勵學員必須以恆自待，方克有濟。至十二時，乃告散會，今日（星期一）起，開始正式上課，舊生亦得　聯。</p>

<h3>防空日</h3>
<p>一月一茺的防空日，今天已是第十六次了。每月此日由防空本部指示的訓練工作，相信每一市長應該都能了解。我們居住於後方重要基地的上海，敵線突襲隨時可能，無論為人為已，減少損害，對於防空工作都應切實注意。</p>
<p>在突襲時應特別注意的：1.家人避難住所時，應酌留一二人看守，以記火災及強盜事件。2.窗戶宜打開，減少震動受損。3.敵線有時投下形似口紅鉛筆等物，其中置有爆炸物，打開即炸，如發現切勿拾取。</p>
<p>其次，執行防空指導的保甲人員，也應以身作則，慎於職守，過去在突襲警報時，常有保甲青年人員相互　　，不但置職守於不顧，且足給予一般市民以惡劣影響，不可不慎。</p>
<p>目前在長期燈光管制期內，晚間孥爭突襲警報，燈光亦不宜外　，而實際上住戶窗光外　間蜀到處皆是，而一般馬路灘販，更是燈光炬明，毫無防空設備，而警保人員亦不加糾正，道是也應注意的。</p>

If this continues, the foundation of Japan's survival will be in imminent danger. Currently, the great task of reversing the tide depends solely on our 100 million compatriots.

<h3>Over a Hundred Enemy Planes Crashed Near Tokyo and Nagoya, Results of Japanese Air and Air Defense Forces Confirmed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the morning of the 7th, the U.S. Air Force, with a combined formation of about 120 B-29s and P-51s, invaded Tokyo, and about 150 B-29s bombed the vicinity of Nagoya. The Japanese side immediately launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy aircraft. It has since been determined that 14 aircraft, including one P-51, were shot down near Tokyo, and about 40 were damaged. Near Nagoya, 16 aircraft were shot down and more than 40 were damaged, achieving a brilliant victory of shooting down and destroying a total of more than 110 aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the morning of the 7th, a combined formation of enemy air force, including a total of 130 fighters and bombers, including B-29s from the Mariana Islands base and P-51s from the Iwo Jima base, carried out the first joint bombing of Tokyo. A powerful formation of about 150 B-29s also attacked Nagoya. The enemy planes attacking Tokyo invaded western Tokyo from the vicinity of Sagami Bay and attacked the factory area. At the same time, about 150 P-51s invaded the homeland from the Kumano Sea area. First, a small number of planes attacked the Hanshin area, and the main force passed through Ise Bay and invaded Nagoya, bombing the factory area for 50 minutes from about 10:00 AM. Also, around 9:40 AM, several other planes attacked Oshima and Niijima. Japanese air units and ground air defense units immediately engaged in a fierce battle. The results are currently being investigated. The damage from this air raid on Tokyo was minor. Also, enemy planes dropped many bombs on Nagoya, and dropped several bombs on Shizuoka and Hamamatsu when fleeing. The fact that the U.S. Air Force from the southern base jointly attacked with B-29s and P-51s, and at the same time bombed the Tokyo and Nagoya areas with a powerful formation of more than 100 planes, proves that the US military's bombing campaign against the Japanese homeland is intensifying.</p>

<h3>On the New Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>After Japanese Prime Minister Koiso submitted his resignation on the 5th of this month, General Suzuki was ordered to organize a successor cabinet and began to consider candidates for cabinet members. All members were decided on the afternoon of the 7th, and the official appointment ceremony was held that evening. At this point, the new cabinet, supported by all parties, was formally formed.</p>
<p>At a time when the battle for Okinawa Island is unfolding, enemy malicious rumors about this cabinet reshuffle in our ally, Japan, are inevitable. Therefore, we must specifically point out the true significance of this Japanese cabinet reshuffle.</p>
<p>First, the Japanese cabinet reshuffle is not significantly related to Japan's national policy. This is because Japan's fundamental national policy was proclaimed in the "Declaration of War" on December 8th, which is a national policy that any cabinet must absolutely abide by. The change of cabinet personnel only aims to better adapt to the environment and use more effective methods to achieve this national policy. Looking back on the Great East Asia War, the Japanese cabinet has been reorganized three times, but its national policy of following the Declaration of War to seek self-preservation, self-defense, and liberation of East Asia has always been consistent, which can be seen as clear proof. Therefore, any speculation involving a change in Japanese national policy has no factual basis and is not credible.</p>
<p>Second, the basic task of the new cabinet of our ally, Suzuki, is entirely to focus politics on the decisive battle, to more closely coordinate command and national policy, in order to maximize the national strength. Recalling that last July, when Prime Minister Koiso succeeded the Tojo cabinet in shouldering the great power, he put forward the slogan of "Great Harmony and Unity" in order to achieve a new heart and soul to complete the war, and established a national total mobilization system to cope with the war situation. Therefore, in the past eight months, he has created the Supreme War Guidance Council, and more recently implemented a new political system, stipulating that the Prime Minister may attend Imperial Headquarters meetings, so that military districts and local councils are closely aligned. These measures are all aimed at closely linking national policy with operations in order to achieve the war's objectives. Now that the internal and external situation is even more important, the need for national unity, the gathering of total strength, and the strengthening of the integration of national policy and the command headquarters are even more urgent. The Suzuki cabinet will resolutely shoulder this important task. As the Asahi Shimbun editorial said on the 6th, "How to integrate command and political affairs is now extremely clear." This is precisely the expectation of the entire Japanese nation for the Suzuki cabinet, and it is also the main central policy of the Suzuki cabinet's administration.</p>
<p>Third, the new cabinet of our ally is a more powerful cabinet of military-official-civilian cooperation, and it is also a decisive battle cabinet for the whole country. This is because its establishment was jointly supported by the Army and Navy, and by General Minami Jiro, the president of the recently established "national party" Greater Japan Political Association, and others. Those who participated in this new cabinet are all daring and promising figures in the Japanese government and society. Following the Army and Navy Ministers Anami and Yonai, figures such as Hirose Kurahe, Minister of Munitions and Transportation Toyoda, and Minister of State and Director of the Information Bureau Shimomura, in particular, are deeply loved by the people and have long been known for their virtue and prestige. The Mainichi Shimbun editorial on the 6th pointed out that "The 100 million people of the nation wish the General to handle national affairs with all his strength, defeat the enemy, and complete the holy war." The Yomiuri Shimbun editorial on the same day also pointed out that "On this day of unfolding the decisive battle in the homeland, it is truly the eager expectation of our 100 million people that General Suzuki will come out to handle matters." From this, we can see the trend of the hearts of the entire nation of our ally. Therefore, we can assert that the new cabinet established by our ally this time will surely be able to better realize the slogans of "Great Harmony and Unity" and "100 Million as One," gather the total strength of the entire nation, and adapt to the new internal and external situation.</p>
<p>The establishment of this new cabinet in Japan cannot help but make us feel more strongly the importance of the tasks of all parties in our country. Chairman Chen of the National Government said in a speech on the 7th: "I firmly believe that the new cabinet will be able to promote the policies of the state with a stronger lineup and carry out the decisive battle. Based on its goal of seeking liberation, the National Government will, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, with the determination to live and die together, implement the initial intention of participating in the war, strive forward, and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War." We must firmly adhere to our beliefs, not be swayed by rumors and fluctuations, and establish closer ties with the new cabinet of our ally, and work together to strive for the victory of the Great East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Proclamation of War by the National Government</h3>
<p>On December 8th of the year before last, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly nation, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, England, America, and others continue to employ their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it, even enticing elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, as their violent forces have been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have become even more cunning. They are also resentful of the peaceful development in the areas governed by the National Government, instigating elements from Chongqing to constantly harass and obstruct the progress of various constructions, and directly using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing elements, willing to be driven by England and America and acting as traitors to East Asia, are certainly shameful; but England and America, with their long-standing preoccupation with East Asia, exhaust their ability to sow discord in order to fulfill their ultimate ambition of annexation, which should be met with common hatred and indignation by the nations of East Asia. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with England and America, and will devote all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to sweep away the barbarity of England and America, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries, Manchuria and Thailand, have long maintained friendly relations and share a common understanding of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In the future, they should further enhance cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with the forces of England and America in the West for several years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country, now participating in the Greater East Asia War, should echo their efforts in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should understand that this is the only opportunity to realize the Father of the Nation’s Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this; they should be of one heart and one mind, striving from beginning to end, to carry out this great mission of this great era. January 9th, the thirty-second year of the Republic of China. Chairman Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<h3>On the Conference of International Organizations and Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Tadahisa Matsudaira</p>
<p>The United Nations' plan to convene a conference on peacekeeping organizations on April 25th was long anticipated. However, the decision at the Crimea Conference regarding the location and timing of the conference, believed to be Roosevelt's proposal, with England and the Soviet Union merely following his lead, is not difficult to imagine. We speculate that the reasons why the United States chose this time and place are firstly, to boast of its leadership position, and secondly, to politically pressure Japan. The truth of this has been criticized by Information Minister Kishi in his writings. The central issue of this conference is the "Proposal for a General International Organization for the Post-War Period" decided upon during the Dumbarton Oaks talks. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on October 10th last year, after the conclusion of the talks: The decisions made at Dumbarton Oaks have been submitted by the US government to the United Nations, to be presented for discussion at a future formal plenary session of the UN, and a charter for the international organization is planned to be drafted. However, with all the undecided matters from the Dumbarton Oaks talks decided through political resolution by the leaders of England, America, and the Soviet Union, before convening an international conference, the calling of this conference was long expected. Therefore, to understand the inside story of the San Francisco Conference, it is necessary to first review the decisions made at Dumbarton Oaks. At the same time, to understand how this conference will affect the nations of East Asia, it is necessary to understand how England and America are dealing with Chongqing. The following is a explanation based on recent data:</p>
<p>The Beginning and End of the Dumbarton Oaks Talks</p>
<p>The war aims of the Axis powers in this war are: for Germany, to break the unreasonable and unfair Versailles system and build a new order in Europe; for Japan, to liberate the nations of East Asia from the control of England, America, and the Netherlands, in order to complete the independence of each nation and build a new order in East Asia. Conversely, England and America do not express their true war aims to the world. Although the Atlantic Charter elucidates the Anglo-American policy towards world politics, its main content focuses on respecting liberalism. However, the actions of England and America run contrary to the Charter, and countries around the world view the Atlantic Charter as an expression of Anglo-American egoism. Therefore, England and America keenly felt the need to immediately create a world policy that would be accepted by the people of the world, on the one hand embellishing their war aims, and on the other hand inducing other countries to oppose Japan's Greater East Asia policy. They then mobilized domestic and international law scholars and sponsored organizations to study international political organizations.</p>
<p>The United States was most enthusiastic about this research, and by the end of May of last year, a plan had been finalized, which was then sent to England, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. In late August, England, America, the Soviet Union, and England, America, and Chongqing held informal talks. On October 9th, a "Proposal for a General International Organization for the Post-War Period" was drafted. It is not difficult to imagine why the United States showed such great enthusiasm for this research and took the initiative to promote it. The war aims of the United States are unclear. During the last war, Wilson was unable to join the League of Nations due to opposition from Congress, exposing the lack of unity at home. Therefore, this time, it must not repeat the same mistake and must seek proper domestic measures.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Talks</p>
<p>These talks were not held with representatives from England, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing gathered in one place, but rather, based on the Soviet Union's wishes, the three representatives from England, America, and the Soviet Union first discussed and reached an agreement. Then, England and America, based on this agreement, held talks with the representatives from Chongqing, deliberated on Chongqing's intentions, and made a decision. Chongqing was merely an uninvited guest.</p>
<p>It was expected at the time that the talks between England, America, and the Soviet Union would be concluded in two or three weeks. However, the Soviet Union, due to insufficient preparation, requested a postponement, and as a result, the talks were postponed by one week and opened on August 21st. Moreover, differences of opinion arose between England, America, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, had to request instructions from his government on every matter, so the talks progressed very slowly. After six weeks, opinions gradually became aligned.</p>
<p>However, in the talks between England, America, and Chongqing, although Chongqing had proposals, they were all opposed by England and America. The talks lasted only ten days and were hastily concluded.</p>
<p>According to Hull, the nature of these talks was informal. The issues discussed did not include politics, economics, or military affairs. It is difficult to judge whether the representatives of various countries will accept this agreement without consideration when the San Francisco Conference is convened in the future, or whether there will be endless debate. The French de Gaulle government is still hesitant, also fearing that this plan will actually restrict the freedom of all countries. Whether England and America will accept the French amendment proposal is uncertain. If not, then France will definitely not participate, which will have a significant impact on the fate of the small countries.</p>
<p>Content of the Decisions Made at the Talks</p>
<p>According to the announcement on October 9th of last year, the content of the decisions made at the Dumbarton Oaks talks consists of a total of twelve chapters. Later, based on fragmented information, the details of each chapter were also clarified. The outline is listed as follows: Chapter 1: Purposes; Chapter 2: Principles; Chapter 3: Member States; Chapter 4: Principal Organs; Chapter 5: General Assembly; Chapter 6: Security Council; Chapter 7: International Court of Justice; Chapter 8: Measures to Prevent and Suppress Aggression for the Maintenance of International Peace and Security; Chapter 9: Arrangements for International Economic and Social Cooperation; Chapter 10: Secretariat; Chapter 11: Amendment Procedures; Chapter 12: Transitional Arrangements.</p>
<p>The name of this international organization was decided to be "United Nations," but what differs in substance from the League of Nations is: The authority of the United Nations Security Council to ensure security is stronger than that of the League of Nations Council, and the authority of the permanent members of the Council (major powers) is even greater, so the authority of the General Assembly is greatly reduced. A Military Committee and an International Air Force are established to prevent or suppress aggression. In addition, no special troops are established, and the troops of the permanent members of the Council are responsible for preventing or suppressing aggression. Small countries are also members of the General Assembly in form based on the principle of equal sovereignty, but compared to the League of Nations, they actually have no power.</p>
<p>Secondly, what had not yet been decided at the end of the talks was the voting rights of the Security Council. Opinions on general principles seemed to be consistent among all countries, namely that all decisions must be agreed upon by all members of the Council. However, when one of the members of the Council becomes a party to a dispute, the party to the dispute cannot participate in the vote (advocated by England, America, and Chongqing), or can still participate in the vote (advocated by the Soviet Union). This issue may seem to be merely a procedural issue on the surface, but it is actually a major political issue. As a result, the Soviet Union suspects that the United Nations may become a medium for organizing an anti-Soviet crusade, so it stubbornly adheres to its preconceived notions. On the other hand, England and America suspect that the Soviet Union is promoting a strong policy in various parts of the world, whether it is creating a fait accompli, so they consistently insist on the right to decide on aggressor countries. (Please refer to Information Minister Kishi's "Hallucinatory San Francisco Conference.") However, this issue was largely passed in accordance with the Soviet Union's proposals at the Crimea Conference. Therefore, Senator Vandenberg of the US Senate, Pivoley and Harris, members of the British Liberal Party, and Davis, a member of the Labor Party, believe that it is unreasonable for the major powers to be unrestricted by the United Nations while only the small countries are restricted, and they demand that this point be amended. It is expected that the San Francisco Conference will also have considerable problems due to this point.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Attitude Towards the Dumbarton Oaks Talks</p>
<p>Chongqing dispatched Wei Daoming to attend the Dumbarton Oaks talks, and it seems that he also took along independent proposals. Chongqing's proposals differ from other proposals, and what is particularly interesting to us are the following points:</p>
<p>The League of Nations Establishes an International Police Force</p>
<p>In order to prevent aggression, it attempted to establish an international police force directly under the League of Nations, but it was not passed due to opposition from various countries.</p>
<p>Specific Colonies are Under International Administration</p>
<p>An International Committee is established under the League of Nations to place certain colonies under international administration, and in the future, to provide guidance to the residents of the colonies to enable them to develop into autonomous or independent countries. This idea is similar to the mandate system and seems to have an idealistic style. Chongqing intends to adopt this form for the Japanese-occupied areas in Southeast Asia with a large number of overseas Chinese. However, this proposal was also opposed by various countries and rejected.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Principle of Racial Equality</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on September 15th of last year, the Chongqing representative requested that the principle of racial equality be recognized in the future international organization, but England and America deemed it inappropriate and opposed it. In addition, the United Press dispatch further explained that the principle of racial equality had been discussed at the peace conference of the previous war in 1919 when drafting the Covenant of the League of Nations, and was proposed by Japan. This time, Chongqing made the same proposal and suffered the same fate of being rejected, which is a wonderful coincidence. The Soviet Union, which has long advocated the principle of racial equality, was unable to meet at the Dumbarton Oaks talks, which is also a wonderful coincidence.</p>
<p>Among the above Chongqing proposals, the second and third items represent the ideology of East Asia. In particular, the third item, the principle of racial equality, is consistent with the fifth principle of the Greater East Asia Declaration, which is evidence that Chongqing has not yet lost the ideology of Greater East Asia, which is extremely interesting. It is inevitable that these proposals will be opposed by England and America, but Chongqing must inevitably feel a sense of loss. From this, it can also be proved how subtle Chongqing's voice is.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference and the Attitudes of Various Countries</p>
<p>It is said that the San Francisco Conference has issued invitations to 39 countries. It is rumored that the Crimea Conference decided that countries that have not declared war on the Axis powers before March 1st are not qualified to participate in the conference. Therefore, six South American countries immediately declared war. Moreover, recently, Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, etc. have been forced by England and America to hastily declare war on the Axis powers in order to obtain the qualifications to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>The French de Gaulle government was once considered one of the invited countries, but for the above reasons, it refused to participate. After much effort by England and America, it was recently reported that it has agreed to send representatives to attend the conference. The Italian Bonomi government, although created by England and America, decided not to allow it to participate, causing dissatisfaction with the Bonomi government. The most strange thing is that Syria and Lebanon, although they declared war, were not allowed to formally participate. After de Gaulle's mediation, they were only allowed to attend as observers. The resentment in the hearts of these two countries can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Dumbarton Oaks proposal for the League of Nations was not initially sent to Argentina, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, or Portugal. Argentina was recently forced to declare war and succumbed. Spain was forced to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. The above countries will not participate. In addition, Poland, Afghanistan, etc. have not accepted the invitation and will not attend. Poland, etc. have expressed considerable resentment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the intentions of the participating countries, what is noteworthy is that England and America are both making every effort to bring as many accomplices as possible to the conference to increase their power. For example, the United States is accompanied by Latin America and 19 South American countries, as well as Liberia and the Philippines. England has representatives from its affiliated countries, the four European countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Greece, and the five Near Eastern countries of Turkey, Egypt, Arabia, Iran, and Iraq, for a total of 14 representatives. In addition, the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia can also be considered half-friends of England.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Soviet Union's attitude is completely different. Although the above-mentioned Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic can serve the Soviet Union, it will not bring any accomplices this time. Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland could at least form accomplices of the Soviet Union to participate in the San Francisco Conference, but this is not the case. Whether this is because the Soviet Union is adopting a policy of not engaging in external activities, or whether England and America are taking this opportunity to oppose participation because the borders and political situation of these three countries are unstable, it is difficult to understand. It is generally believed that it was decided in respect of the Soviet Union's opinions that it would not participate this time. It is not difficult to imagine that the Soviet Union requested that representatives from its own Ukraine and Byelorussian Federation be allowed to participate in the conference. England has already recognized this, and the United States, on the condition of reciprocity, has finally accepted it. Therefore, it has now been decided to allow these representatives to attend. From this fact, it can be seen that the Soviet Union intends to create a necessary group of accomplices to attend the conference together, which is quite obvious. In addition, the Soviet Union's mediation for the participation of the Polish Lublin government in the conference was a proposal to create a fait accompli, which was rejected by England and America. Before the conference was convened, the relationship between England and America and the Soviet Union due to the San Francisco Conference was extremely subtle. In addition, the issue that arose between the United States and the Soviet Union was that the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to each send three official representatives to the conference. However, due to opposition from other parties, the United States suddenly changed its policy of sending three representatives on April 2nd, and the Secretary of State announced that it would be changed to one, which caused the Soviet Union to panic.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Position at the San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>Chongqing was not invited to attend the Crimea Conference, but it has always obeyed the decisions made by England, America, and the Soviet Union, so it will send representatives to attend this time. However, Roosevelt had previously requested that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party unite and send representatives. Therefore, with Song Ziwen as the leader, in addition to selecting first-class figures such as Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, and Hu Shi, he added Communist Party representative Dong Biwu and representatives from various parties, Zhang Junmai and Li Huang, to avoid the dictatorial color of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>An understanding has been reached between England, America, and the Soviet Union. England will select official representatives from its colonies such as Canada, Australia, India, and South Africa. The United States and the Soviet Union will each send three official representatives. However, Chongqing has not been granted this qualification. Even if Chongqing has this qualification to send three official representatives, with the Communist Party representative receiving the same treatment as Song Ziwen and Gu Weijun, it is impossible in domestic relations, so its situation is quite difficult. Various countries are appointing figures of the rank of Foreign Minister as representatives, but Chongqing is appointing Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, as the head of the delegation, and Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, Hu Shi, and Wei Daoming, who are first-class figures in the diplomatic community, as his entourage. Comparing this to the Soviet Union sending only Gromyko, the ambassador to the United States, as the chairman of the delegation, it is like sending adults to attend a children's conference, which gives people a rather strange feeling. So why is Chongqing sending nearly 50 escorts? According to our observation, there are two reasons:</p>
<p>First, Zhu Ziwen has no trusted escorts and is not qualified to send three official representatives, so among his escorts, there are more than three people with experience as Foreign Ministers in order to arrange the prestige.</p>
<p>Second, it is imagined that the Yalta Conference decided on European issues, so this conference must have a resolution on Pacific political issues. Then Chongqing will also share in the benefits, that is, with the ambition of gaining more after achieving a goal, it has specially dispatched a large number of escorts to prepare to individually persuade England, America, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>From the Greater East Asia region, only Chongqing and the Osmeña government of the Philippines are participating in the San Francisco Conference. In particular, the latter has not been recognized by any country, and the United States' request to send representatives to attend proves the many forced facts of this conference. These two governments do not represent the entire East Asia, but are only representatives of tens of millions of Asians. Therefore, Chongqing deliberately sent a large number of escorts to show its strength, which is also unknown. Chongqing plans to re-propose the international administration of colonies and the principle of racial equality at the San Francisco Conference, but the United States has already stated that this conference will not discuss the colonial issue and the European border issue. As for the principle of racial equality, it will definitely be opposed by England and America, so it is clear that Chongqing cannot advocate any independent proposals with its current strength. Chongqing intends to use this conference to prevent the threat from the northwest of Asia, so if there are proposals regarding the definition and prevention of aggression, and sympathy for small countries, it will definitely firmly support the opinions in order to seek its own favorable international relations.</p>
<p>In short, Chongqing should realize that cooperation with Japan cannot be successful in the world political arena. Moreover, Chongqing will definitely be aware that this conference and American imperialism are dominated by its own self-interest policies, and the representatives it sends will definitely return disappointed, which can be predicted.</p>

<h3>Sixteenth Air Defense Day Today: Comprehensive Training Implemented; Citizens Should Pay Attention to Various Air Defense Essentials</h3>
<p>Today, the 9th, is the 16th Air Defense Day. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, following precedent, will extensively promote the significance of air defense and implement various air defense training exercises. The details are as follows. Citizens are urged to cooperate and implement the training in accordance with the various measures.</p>
<p>Alarm Training</p>
<p>The time for the alarm training has been described in detail in various newspapers the day before yesterday. When the time comes, sirens will not be sounded. However, during the alarm training, if there are actual circumstances that warrant an alarm, sirens will still be sounded. The public should take note. As for the transmission of the alarm, in order to prevent any obstruction, after the issuance and termination of the alarm, the city will uniformly use gongs or other metal objects to replace sirens. The method of striking is as follows:</p>
<p>Pre-air raid warning: Three strikes.</p>
<p>Air raid warning: Random strikes.</p>
<p>Notification of immediate shelter: Also random strikes.</p>
<p>Air raid warning cleared: Three strikes.</p>
<p>Pre-air raid warning cleared: Two strikes again. The striking method will be the same during training. Those in charge must verbally communicate the meaning at any location. There should be a gap of about five to ten seconds between the three strikes and the two strikes for identification.</p>
<p>At the same time, the city will display alarm flags. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>Pre-air raid warning: Blue flag.</p>
<p>Air raid warning: Red flag.</p>
<p>Air raid warning cleared: Blue flag, which must remain until the pre-air raid warning is cleared, at which time the flag will be removed. During training alarms, a small yellow flag will be attached to each colored flag.</p>
<p>Local Training</p>
<p>This is the third local general deployment training, to be implemented by the Huashan and Changmi branch bureaus within their respective jurisdictions. This local training requires all households and all citizens within the jurisdiction to participate in travel training, so that family air defense can be effective in an emergency. Past performance of this training has only involved repeated implementation by participants at the training sites and a limited number of air defense personnel, which is inconsistent with the fundamental spirit of local training. This should be improved. Future implementations should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>The training area should completely block all traffic.</p>
<p>The situation within each household should be adapted to the specific conditions of that household, perform situational simulations, and mobilize all members of the household to participate in the training.</p>
<p>Each household should prepare emergency water, consider the distance between fire points and water sources, and carry out training in transporting about one load of water to each fire point. After the water is released, there should be no interruption. Immediately change the scenario and take swift action.</p>
<p>Air defense personnel participating in the mobilization should focus on leveraging their mobility. Family air defense must be vigorously promoted, with women, the elderly, and children who stay behind being responsible for family protection.</p>
<p>On the day of the air defense training, avoid non-urgent and unnecessary outings, and ensure that all personnel understand the meaning and duty of participating in the training.</p>
<p>Although uniform air defense clothing is not required, all personnel should wear clothing that is easy to move in. Appropriate warning measures should be taken against those who refuse to wear appropriate clothing.</p>
<p>Those who are unfit to participate in air defense activities must be pre-organized and trained for evacuation.</p>
<p>Unoccupied houses are a source of potential fire spread, so absolutely avoid leaving them unattended.</p>
<p>The Huashan and Changmi branch bureaus should thoroughly inform citizens within their jurisdictions of all relevant points of this training. On the day, Yuyuan Road and Changmi Road will be the boundary, divided into two areas. The northern area will undergo two hours of continuous, intensive comprehensive training from 10:00 AM, and the southern area will undergo two hours of continuous, intensive comprehensive training from 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Other Training</p>
<p>Traffic Control: At 2:30 PM, when the air raid alarm training is initiated, strict traffic control will be implemented throughout the city. In addition to mobilizing all police officers, the保甲 (bao jia, a local administrative unit) air defense personnel will be summoned to assist. All pedestrians and all vehicles without emergency identification must follow the prescribed procedures to thoroughly implement traffic control, otherwise they will be punished.</p>
<p>Lights Out: At 8:30 PM, when the air raid alarm training is initiated, air raid lights out must be thoroughly implemented. Those who violate this will have their power immediately cut off, and the branch bureau chief will impose a power outage penalty of up to ten days. Those who deliberately violate the blackout should be reported for long-term power outages. Special attention must be paid to the lights of cars, pedicabs, rickshaws, and other vehicles to reduce violations. In the past, the suppression of lights from rooftops and other outdoor lights has been very poor, so any light leakage other than electric lights should be confiscated, and a detention penalty of up to five days should be imposed according to the alarm violation regulations to enhance the implementation of air defense.</p>
<p>At the same time, at 4:00 PM, when the air raid alarm training is initiated, air defense training should be implemented in factories in various districts according to plan, as well as fire extinguishing, shelter, rescue, or other comprehensive training.</p>

<h3>Germany's Air Raid Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Since the great air raid on Hamburg, Germany has had many measures to deal with the scorched city of Berlin. The following will describe food, housing, evacuation, rescue, and finance:</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Regarding food, the pre-emptive countermeasures were to reduce the storage of food to a minimum in large cities located in air raid danger zones and to disperse the storage in existing facilities in small surrounding suburban cities. Local food bureaus constantly maintain the amount of food existing in each region. When local food supplies are insufficient during an air raid, the state will make up the difference. If it is still not enough, then other states will assist. Places nationwide are selected, with the standard of one-fifth of the population in air raid danger zones being the target for the food stored in food warehouses. In addition, there is food stored by the National Defense Forces, which can also be used. The organization is quite extensive.</p>
<p>As for post-event countermeasures, after an air raid, the NSV (National Socialist Welfare Organization) distributes one week's worth of rationed food without coupons to needy citizens and workers, and distributes coffee and fine brandy during concerts and in the event of air raid damage to food coupons. Further, a (special air raid ration) is implemented for the general public, especially allocating meat, coffee, and wine once to reward citizens for their heroic efforts. Since the beginning of last year, within Berlin, those who have proof of eligibility for food rations have almost constantly received the same special rations as the military, thereby boosting the morale of the citizens.</p>
<p>As for materials other than food, emergency repair construction materials, repair tools, clothing, and other food warehouses are stored outside the danger zone. If the storage is not sufficient for application, it will be supplied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' food warehouse. For such distributed storage items to be readily available for application, the soundness of transportation agencies is of the utmost importance. As for post-event countermeasures, the NSV supplies daily necessities such as clothing and tableware without the need for purchase, and distributes other materials in advance. In addition, coal and other fuels are distributed to replace the shortage of gas due to air raids.</p>
<p>Housing</p>
<p>In accordance with the Housing Supply Order, a thorough investigation is carried out on the number of empty houses and the (number of rooms and people) of houses owned by each citizen due to the evacuation of the urban population. This is to supply housing to air raid victims. Evacuated households must hand over their Berlin homes to the NSV for management. The buildings to which the Housing Supply Order applies are generally:</p>
<p>1. Buildings that are not the primary residence.</p>
<p>2. Households with surplus rooms.</p>
<p>3. Those whose purpose of use is not wartime.</p>
<p>Generally, these apply to large mansions with few occupants. The forced evacuation of the urban population follows the principle of returning to their place of origin, implementing group evacuations. The NSV mediates to find them homes. The NSV handles everything, including the transportation of luggage.</p>
<p>In addition, small fire-resistant houses made of reinforced concrete are built on a large scale in the suburbs of the city to provide accommodation for disaster-stricken citizens. Damaged or half-burned houses are fully utilized, repaired, and then used. The municipal authorities are responsible for repairing these houses to make them weatherproof. After an air raid, those whose houses are destroyed will first be temporarily sheltered in designated buildings, and then quickly provided with temporary housing.</p>
<p>Medical Treatment</p>
<p>In addition to buildings such as schools and hotels, (evacuation hospitals) are set up outside air raid danger zones to transport the wounded for treatment. At the same time, hospital basements are strengthened with bulletproof and fireproof equipment. These air-raid shelters can perform any major surgery, even during air raids. In addition, there is an underground hospital successfully built by the Todt Organization, which is the most ideal. This type of hospital with underground bulletproof and fireproof equipment can withstand large bombs, and is unusually sturdy.</p>
<p>As for air raid rescue periods, rescue squads are constantly formed by people who have undergone rescue training. Rescue teams from factories and companies are particularly active. A characteristic of this type of rescue team in Germany is that rescue and first aid are carried out by the same person, so first aid treatment can be given on the spot after rescue.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>During an air raid, banks and postal savings offices continue to handle payment matters as usual. Therefore, banks set up branches or offices in any remote village to handle the payment of deposits. The deposit payment procedure is very simple. If the deposit book is lost or damaged, payment can be made as long as the original record is verified. Dried banknotes can be exchanged for new banknotes as long as they can be identified as banknotes. (Translated from the March 7th edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Western District Self-Defense Brigade Held Review Yesterday</h3>
<p>The model self-defense corps in the Huashan Road and Changmi Road保甲 (bao jia) districts in this city officially established a district brigade yesterday (the 8th) morning after being uniformly organized. Chief Gu Jiwu of the保甲 (bao jia) office inspected the brigade. At 9:30 AM, the model self-defense brigades of the two districts gathered on the large lawn of St. John's University on Fanhangdu Road. Chief Gu arrived on time to inspect the brigade. After the inspection, Zhou Shaobai, the chief of the Changmi general联保 (lian bao, a grouping of bao jia), gave a speech reporting on the organization of the model self-defense corps. Chief Gu then gave an encouraging speech. Subsequently, Shen Siliang, the chairman of Changmi, gave a speech. The review concluded at 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>From Shanghai to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>-- Jiaxi</p>
<p>Before the war, there were regular steamships between Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, directly reaching Tianshenggang, Zhanghuanggong, Kou'an, Yangzhou, and other places, making transportation extremely convenient. Currently, transportation tools are scarce, making even a short distance seem like a long way away. Here is a brief description of the recent traffic conditions on this route for the reference of those returning home:</p>
<p>Steamship: China Steamship Company has steamships operating on the Shanghai to Tianshenggang route. One is the "Hana" which can carry 1,200 passengers; another is the "Yuanhe," which can carry 1,000 passengers. They berth at the Bund 6, 7, 12, and the old Taikoo Wharf. The sailing schedule is indefinite and is notified by bulletin. Tickets for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class are sold at China Steamship Company, No. 4 Beijing Road. Tickets for 4th class are sold at the Lidax company, the agent at Jinliyuan Wharf in Xinzha River. The fares are 9,200 yuan for 1st class, 7,200 yuan for 2nd class, 5,200 yuan for 3rd class, 3,500 yuan for berth, and 2,600 yuan for 4th class. Up to 700 to 800 4th class tickets can be sold. Tickets are sold from 10:00 AM on the day of departure, and the departure time is 2:00 PM. This route is the most convenient, but the sailing schedule is now indefinite, and it is even suspended for many days. Therefore, wooden boat shipping companies have emerged to engage in passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and northern Jiangsu. However, they are all in the trial stage, and shortcomings are inevitable. There are many areas that need improvement.</p>
<p>Sailboat: Wufu Company - located at No. 6, Lane 36, Liuhe Road (formerly Lloyd Road), telephone 93854, manager Zhang Jingqing. Currently has seven or eight large sailing boats, directly sailing to Nantong Yaogang and Haimen Jihong. The docking place is by the Suzhou River at the entrance of the Huashang Cloth Exchange warehouse at the west end of Xinzha Bridge. Departure time is 8:00 AM every morning starting from the 10th. The water journey turns from the Suzhou River into the Huangpu River, then turns into the Yangtze River westward, and can reach Yaogang before dark. The smaller boats can accommodate 30 to 40 passengers, and the larger ones can accommodate about 100 passengers. More luggage can be carried. The fare is 8,000 yuan per person, and the water freight for each piece of luggage is within 1,000 yuan. This company is entrusted by the Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen and Qidong Associations in Shanghai to assist in the evacuation of fellow villagers. Those who are poor and have proof documents from the fellow villagers associations can receive a reduced fare, half charged according to their condition, or completely free of charge.</p>
<p>Highway: Dade United Transportation Company - located at No. 110 Wuding Road, the Central District contact point is Room 114, Continental Hotel, West Xizang Road. The route starts from Shanghai, departs by car, travels through Jiading, Taicang to Changshu. Then drive north to Fushan Port, change to the company's specially prepared small steamboat and drive straight across the river to Yaogang. The main part of this route is all on land, with more checkpoints along the way. It takes about seven or eight hours from Shanghai to Fushan Port, and the river surface from Fushan to Yaogang is more than 30 li, and it takes two or three hours to cross the river. You can still arrive on the same day. The company currently has three rented cars, which depart at 8:00 AM every Wednesday and Saturday. The fare per person is 40,000 yuan, and it is inconvenient to carry large luggage.</p>
<p>Tongda Transportation Commercial Firm - located at No. 524, Zhonghui Building, Dashanghai Road. The company's route is mainly by water, only the section from Shanghai to Wusong uses cars (the car fare is 3,000). From Wusong, take a sailboat to Yaogang. The boat ticket is 1,300 yuan, but passengers need to bring their own food, and can bring two or three pieces of luggage, with an additional luggage fee of about 1,000 yuan per piece. You also need to pay a tip of about 1,000 yuan when you disembark. The journey time from Shanghai to Wusong is about 2 hours, and from Wusong to Yaogang is about 10 hours. Departure starts at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM, and arrival is around evening.</p>
<p>Civilian Boat: Tonghai Civilian Boat Company - The ticket office is located at Zheng Tai Xiang Ji local goods store, No. 26, Central Market, North Xizang Road. The boat is docked by the Suzhou River in front of the Central Market. It departs every one or two days, heading to Jihong, Laohonggang, Tianshenggang, Qinglonggang and other places. The boat fare is 7,300 yuan per person, plus a tip of 10%. One lunch is provided on board, and another tip of about 1,000 yuan is paid when disembarking. This company is entrusted by the Tonghai Fellow Villagers Association to assist in the evacuation of fellow villagers. Those who have proof documents from the fellow villagers association will have the boat fare reduced appropriately. It is possible to arrive on the same day.</p>
<p>Railway: Another route is the regular route to Yangzhou and other places, that is, take a train from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, and then take a steamboat across the river to Yangzhou or Gaoyou and other places. However, it is not easy to get on the train, and the cost is extremely high, which passengers suffer from.</p>
<p>In the sailing boat routes mentioned above, although there are fewer checkpoints along the way, robbery incidents occasionally occur when sailing on the river. In the future, in addition to strengthening defense capabilities, there is almost no other defense method. In addition, overloading the boat or too many passengers often leads to disaster. Therefore, the management should pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Installation of Water and Electricity Projects Requires Application for Permission, and a Certificate is Issued After Inspection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau stipulates that general water and electricity stores installing water and electricity projects must first submit a design of the installation project to the bureau for permission, and then start construction. After completion, they must report to the bureau for inspection. The bureau will send personnel to inspect and issue a certificate of qualification before it is considered reasonable. However, recently, general water and electricity engineering stores have often started construction without reporting to the bureau beforehand. The bureau has determined to rectify this. If there are any water and electricity projects in this city, they must be reported in accordance with the law, otherwise, in addition to being punished according to regulations, a certificate of qualification will be refused.</p>
<p>Registration of Electrical Material Stores</p>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau has noted that there are many electrical material stores in the city. In order to unify management, it will conduct registration of these stores in the near future. The second section of the bureau is currently drafting the registration regulations, which will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Changmi Police Branch Chief Investigates Extortionist Police Officer</h3>
<p>Wang Shuxun, a patrol officer on Changmi Road, had an evil thought when a train was about to arrive at the station during his night patrol the other night around 11:00 PM. He asked his colleague to wait at an intersection several bu (a Chinese unit of length, approx. 5ft) away from the station to intercept a passenger, Yao Henian, who was carrying luggage. The officer stopped him, and when the passenger became nervous, he extorted 5,000 yuan from him and was about to flee. Fortunately, the chief of the branch, Yao Benyuan, was personally inspecting the area and saw him walking alone, which was inconsistent with his patrol route. He interrogated him, and the officer had no choice but to confess the truth. He was immediately taken back to the bureau and detained. It is reported that the case has been reported to the general bureau for dismissal and referral to the prosecutor's office for legal action.</p>
<h3>University Students Held Crime Prevention Speech Contest Yesterday</h3>
<p>The (Crime Prevention Speech Contest), sponsored by the Shanghai Student Crime Prevention Research Committee and supported by the Crime Prevention Section of the Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, was held at the Great Shanghai Grand Theater yesterday (the 8th) morning at 9:00 AM. More than 1,000 people attended, including Li Shiyu, the director of the Third Division of the Police Bureau, as well as section chiefs, directors, education representatives, and students from universities, middle schools, and vocational schools. Director Li delivered a speech first, explaining the true meaning of crime prevention in detail and expressing his gratitude and appreciation for the university students' enthusiastic research on crime prevention work. He hoped that students would not only study crime prevention theories but also pursue practical work in order to reap benefits. After the speech, the contest began. Zhang Canguang, Liu Shaokui, Dao Chengrang, Wu Xiguang, Zhou Guanghui, and Yang Suishi served as judges. Eleven male and female students participated, including Zhu Shaokun, Hu Zhiyu, Li Xiaoxian, Chen Haijing, Mei Wen, Wu Chuanjia, Pei Guochen, Hu Zhouzeng, Miao Zhengyi, Lin Jiamu, and Xi Yunhang. Each person elaborated on the meaning and methods of crime prevention. As a result, Hu Tongzeng, a top student from Fudan University, won the championship. The topic was (Crime Prevention Work and Juvenile Rehabilitation Education). The runner-up was Pei Guochen, a top female student from the National Shanghai College of Higher Studies. The topic was (Crime Prevention and Life). The third-place winners were Hu Zhiyu, a top student from Shanghai University, with the topic (Modern Metropolis and Crime Prevention Work), and Chen Haipei, a top female student from East China University, with the topic (How to Prevent Child Crime). Director Li then presented the awards. Finally, the crime prevention film (Turning Back is the Shore) was screened. The event ended at around 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Drastic Financial Fluctuations in This City Last Week; Prices Still Balanced, Market Conditions Clear</h3>
<p>The financial market in this city continued to experience drastic fluctuations in the last week. At the beginning of the week, due to the wait-and-see attitude of the bulls, following the aftershocks of the previous week's rise, retail investors showed some signs of relinquishment, and the market did not show any progress. On Tuesday, powerful forces suddenly sold, and the dumping of空頭 (kong tou, bears) helped, the market sentiment was fatigued, the purchase of government bonds and Chinese stocks suddenly rose, and the market price fell consistently, with a trend of rapidly declining. On Wednesday morning, the market was still sluggish, but in the afternoon, news of bullish developments spread, immediately reversing the upward trend, but most people were unable to confirm the reality, and the expression was slightly daring. This Thursday, the news was confirmed, the public morale was greatly boosted, and investors competed to absorb government bonds and stocks. On Friday, it was even worse, and an unprecedented boom was re-exhibited for two days. On Saturday morning, the market was initially flat, then surged, and finally flattened again. The changes in finance within a week ran in opposite directions with completely different results. Government bonds had fluctuations of over two million yuan, with the highest price reaching over 6.2 million at the beginning. Government bonds also fluctuated between 4,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan. Among Chinese stocks, Yong'an, Meiya, and China Bookstore, the three hottest stocks, fluctuated between 300 yuan and 1,000 yuan. First, more than 30 stocks fell to the limit, and then more than 60 stocks rose to the limit, which shows the intensity of the changes. Although the main cause of this financial change was the international situation, stimulating the activities of speculators in general, the change in the general public's investment target, and the use of the majority of floating funds to invest in gold, government bonds and stocks, was indeed a major cause. Therefore, observing the drastic changes in finance in the past week, the buying and selling of goods in the industrial and commercial sectors has been unusually sluggish. In addition to daily necessities related to people's livelihoods having transactions, other non-essential items can be said to have few inquiries. This can also indicate that the stockpiling of materials is gradually stabilizing, and the people's purchasing power has decreased. Therefore, recent prices have been flat or even low, which shows that the previous rise in prices was indeed due to artificial reasons. It is hoped that the economic authorities will pay close attention to prevent the recurrence of adverse consequences.</p>
<h3>Measures Discussed for Handling Returned Checks</h3>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city had previously formulated four key points as proposed measures for handling returned checks of depositors or clients, and suggested them to the Banking Association. The Association carefully studied them and drafted provisional measures for handling returned checks, submitting them to the Bankers' Association for discussion and active implementation. It is now understood that the Money Exchange Association has also noticed the increasing number of returned checks recently and believes that handling fees should be collected to prevent returned checks, thereby enhancing the credit of each exchange. This matter has been submitted to the Standing Committee meeting for discussion. The proposed draft measures and the four key points suggested by the Joint Reserve Committee and the Banking Association have also been carefully studied, and a draft of measures for handling returned checks will soon be formulated, to be submitted to the meeting for a decision, and actively implemented on a scheduled basis. It is said that depositors and clients of various banks and exchanges often request a large number of checks from these institutions due to their needs, exceeding the original deposit amount and leading to returned checks.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The large sand barge directly sailing to Tonghai, passing through Liuhe Road, the Sanliu Ping Opera Troupe, and the Jiu Fu Company, has recently been chartered to help fellow villagers from Tonghai return home and assist with evacuation. It is scheduled to sail directly to Nantong Yaogang and Haimen Jintougang within days. The wharf affairs office is located at the west end of Xinzha Bridge, Suzhou River, and at the entrance of the China Merchants' Cotton Cloth Exchange. The company's telephone number is 93854.</p>

<h3>Yongnian Tai Chi Class: Grand Opening of the Second Session</h3>
<p>The Yongnian Tai Chi class organized by this office held its second opening ceremony yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Chinese Educational Moral Improvement Society on Nantong Road. Over two hundred new and returning students attended, along with guests from various fields, including Ma Gongyu, Tang Zuxiang, Zhou Xiangsheng, and Lu Zunshi, who imparted scriptures.</p>
<p>Ma Gongyu gave a speech, saying that his body was weakest in his youth. Since practicing Tai Chi, he has been at it for ten years. In these ten years, he has neither received injections nor taken medicine, and he writes for twelve hours every day without feeling tired. He is approaching sixty years of age, but people think he looks like he's in his forties, which he attributes to Tai Chi. Those who practice Tai Chi today must acknowledge the Yang family, but they must learn from a genuine lineage to glimpse its essence. This is similar to studying calligraphy, where one must follow Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, and have authentic works to emulate, to capture their spirit. Chuan Zhongwen is the grandson of Mr. Yang Chengfu of Yongnian and has personally received instruction from his maternal grandfather since childhood. His family knowledge is profound and extraordinary. In a certain year, Mr. Yang Chengfu was unwell, and he had the chance to meet him and personally witnessed his performance, observing his various techniques, which are beyond the reach of ordinary people. It is rare for everyone to have the opportunity to learn from Master Chuan. Finally, Master Chuan then expounded on the Yang family Tai Chi, in detail. He encouraged the students to be persistent in their practice to achieve success. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. Classes will officially begin today (Monday), and old students are also welcome to rejoin.</p>
<h3>Spring Break Education Seminar: Last Session Yesterday</h3>
<p>The basic education seminar held by this office, taking advantage of the spring break holiday, held its spring break education lectures. Yesterday was the last session. Due to the holiday, the number of participants was even more enthusiastic, reaching over two hundred people, creating a lively atmosphere. After the chairman gave the introductory remarks, the lecturer Mr. Wang Zhicheng gave a speech on (     Teaching Students), which was well-organized, emphasizing both facts and theory. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Air Defense Day</h3>
<p>Today marks the sixteenth Air Defense Day of the month. Every month on this day, the training work instructed by the Air Defense Headquarters, it is believed that every city resident should be able to understand. We reside in Shanghai, an important base in the rear, and enemy raids are always possible. Whether for oneself or others, to reduce damage, everyone should pay close attention to air defense work.</p>
<p>During raids, special attention should be paid to: 1. When family members evacuate to shelters, one or two people should be left to guard the house to note any fire or robbery incidents. 2. Windows should be opened to reduce damage from vibrations. 3. The enemy sometimes drops objects resembling lipstick or pencils, which contain explosives. They explode upon opening, so do not pick them up if found.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Baojia personnel responsible for air defense guidance should also lead by example and be conscientious in their duties. In the past, during raid alarms, Baojia youth often    , neglecting their duties and giving the general public a bad impression, which should be avoided.</p>
<p>Currently, during the long period of light control, lights should not be visible from the outside during raid alarms at night. In reality, light shining from the windows of households are seen everywhere, and street vendors illuminate the roads with bright lights, lacking any air defense equipment, while the police and security personnel do not correct them. This should also be addressed.</p>

<h3>International Cup Football Quarter-Final: China Defeated, Italy Two to One Over Czech</h3>
<p>China met Italy, clashing on the battlefield of Guizhou Park yesterday morning. Due to poor cooperation among the Chinese team and a lack of stamina, they were defeated by Italy one to two, losing their promising future. The first half ended in a tie, each side scoring once. Li Yichen of China underperformed, Zhang Lingen made numerous mistakes, Meng Yiliang was passable, and Liu Guhan was competent. The main reason for China's defeat was inexperience. As soon as the game started, after five minutes, Tekni and Bao jointly penetrated the defense. Li Mi accidentally touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick, which was successfully scored by Sirati. Although China lost a goal, they remained calm. At thirty minutes, Song Yunsheng passed to Li Yichen, and Luo Xulai failed to defend in time. Zhan Linjing took a powerful shot, and Meiniti failed to save it, resulting in a goal and tying the score. The first half ended in a tie. After the break, Li Yichen of China was substituted by Gao Baozheng. China remained in a difficult situation. Bao Yi and Bama once again showed their prowess, but Liu Guhan saved the shots. Italy continued with their aggressive approach. After eight minutes, Vila launched another attack with great momentum. Bao broke through the center and took a powerful shot, resulting in a goal, making it two to one. China launched a counter-attack but failed to score. Italy ultimately narrowly defeated China two to one, winning the right to the international final, where they will face a Nordic team to decide the championship.</p>
<p>Italy: Meiniti, Luo Xulai, Sirati, Boxingni, Aotuoni bath, Xue Weihuo, Di Na, Ba, Tekni, Bao Ni, Vila.</p>
<p>Chinese team: Liu Jihan, Li Mi, Zhang Lingen, Song Sheng, Liu Fugen, Meng Yiliang, Liu Fu (out), Shang (in), Sun Jinshun,  , Li Yichen (in), Gao Baozheng (out), Yu Shengming.</p>
