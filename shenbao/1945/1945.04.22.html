<h3>在有利情勢下　日軍奮戰中　松島部長闡述冲繩戰局</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會昨舉行時事演講會，松為部長出席演說，詞意如下：</p>
<p>「今日新聞協會舉行盛大演講會，本人能有與盟邦諸友會面機會，引為無上光榮。本人想乘此機會，簡單介紹目前帝國海軍之海上作戰。</p>
<p>冲繩作戰意義重大　現在太平注戰局，重點置於冲繩島一帶之戰鬥。敵人英美前已攻佔硫黃島，今復企圖奪取冲繩島為第二據點，俾利用為飛機攻擊日本本土之兩震，乃於三月十七日以來，進犯該方面。此次作戰，在大東亞戰爭海上作戰上，具有最重大意義，無論敵我，均有同感。此次作戰，已成為大東亞決戰之焦點，日及瀨戶內海後，即告開始，敵方企圍先攻擊該方置日航空基地，使日本本土飛機不能來援，並誘出我聯合艦隊，加以擊破，藉謀該島之作戰進展，惟敵方對我航空兵力估計太低，此種事實，不久即告表現出來。</p>
<p>敵軍遭受慘重損害　敵軍出乎意外方防備陣綫前，陷於非常困難境地，爾來敵人反覆攻擊遭受慘重損害。但自四月一日起以約三師團兵力登陸，後在此二十天內，該島作戰日形熾烈，自四月五日開始我軍前後數次總攻擊，至十其日為止，敵所受損失計艦艇三百九十三艘，其中戰艦約二十艘，空母二十餘艘，此對今後敵方作戰，有重大意義喪之兵力至少不下十四萬人，此觀乎沖繩島方面敵航空兵力之遽見減弱，巳可明瞭。在陸上方面，敵軍登陸巳約有六師團兵力，企圖儘速攻佔該島，但迄今並無任何決定性戰果獲得。十八日以來，傳敵軍已發動德攻擊，但結果徒使流血而巳。在此期間，我神風攻擊隊以及陸海軍航空部隊之奮戰，使敵人心驚胆寒，且遭受意外慘重損失。日前羅斯福遽然逝世，或亦為美國對作戰之一個原因。</p>
<p>對特攻隊敵感焦慮　過去英別攻擊隊始終保特缄默，惟最折對我特攻隊之戰果，屢加否認，此可表示敵方對我特攻隊如何感到焦慮，自反面晋來亦可窺見美國國內與論之激昂。又過去美國不願英國艦隊參加太平洋作戰，但此次又要求該艦隊協力，亦可證明美軍損失之慘重。但到今日為止，彼等之協力一無效果可曾，而其損害益加增多。冲繩作戰，於日本方面言，在極有利情勢下進展，敵焦急之餘，從馬里亞納方面出動B29P51等飛飛機機空置襲於我多學科飛機置於絕境，日曬軍敢鬥精神，因此更為激昂。</p>
<p>中日協力完成目的　敵方鑒於歐洲戰局之現狀，將詞次歐宣洲傳兵待力擊至滅亞德洲國至壓軸作戰，今日德國人民雖臨最後罐頭，但為根本打破國際猶太主義制霸世界之野心，繼續作超人的努力，誠如宣傳部長郭培爾宣言，吾人對於戰至量後一兵二卒之德軍愛國精神與勇氣，表示無限敬意，並誓以野東心西。呼但應為，完努動。但為完成此目的，胥賴前錢日軍奮戰以及後方經濟，尤其希望中國諸人士，說就協力。戰爭時各種條件之良否，得戰事目的達到後，始可斷定，吾人切不可受敵方流言蠱惑，應立即使當地經濟情勢，趨于安定，中日協力，發揚共同戰力。</p>
<p>戰爭臨最重要階段　北太平注敵軍企圖，除對甚千大島變方方面度，洋其方餘面無在印度注方面，英國艦隊及空軍逐次增加勢力；以目前情況，猶不能預測將來作戰方向。總之，太平洋戰局現狀，已至大東亞戰爭中最重要階段，吾人應遵奉孫十所謂「置之死地而後生」少名訓，以把握擊減英美之神機。」</p>

<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>財產與戰爭</h3>
<p>— 周毓英</p>
<p>敵方宜傳巳久的舊金山會議，重慶特以宋子文為代表團團長，第一流人物如顧維鈞王寵惠胡適魏道明等為隨員，又有張君勵董必武李璜等參加，總數達五十人。重慶如此鄭重其事的參加會議，更說之英美方面的大吹大擂，好陳這次的會議一定會有巨大的力量，加速解決當前戰爭的痛苦。不過我們對於敵方的會議會談頻煩舉行，不厭其多，只有兩點感覺：第一是證明反軸心國間的矛盾太多，舉行此等會議或會談，想藉此緩和矛盾的尖銳化，避免分裂和衝突；第二是證明反軸心國戰力不充，人民厭戰，乃一再舉行所謂會議會談，想點此刺激戰意，鎭壓厭戰空氣。又英美中催的另一種目的，想藉此欺騙」而拉小國，自然不算浪費，但弱小國家和殖民地國家如對此等會議會談過於重視，或存僥倖心依賴心，那就勢必大上其當。從來戰爭的開端與結局，除了各種涉及感情的行動外，其重心總是在於財產問題，人類的享受離不了財產，人類為了享受所發生的術動，毆鬥，犯罪，以至於各種的內亂，大規模的國內戰爭和世界大戰，都與財產問題有不可分的關係。綜觀常前大戰的癥結，第一亞洲方面是日本於明治維新百年來的進步，經濟發展深受束縛，亞洲各地幾乎全部限制於英美法荷的勢力下，九一八事件便是日本於無可奈何之中試向滿洲求發展，英美於此不思解除整個亞洲的束縛，徒知挑動中國對日抗戰，妄想傍觀圖利，結果戰爭的延擴，終於一發而不可收拾。第二隊洲方面是德國於一九一四年戰敗之餘，凡爾賽條約的束縛，德國困窮不堪，毫無出路，反之英美法各國的富裕優越，相形之下，一則酒肉腐臭，一則餓死道傍，英美若尊重人道正義，對此便早就應該澈底改正，但事實上先則想以德制蘇，繼而想壓制德國，最後則竟聯合蘇聯以求消滅德國，可是我們知道，萬一德國眞被消滅，則歐洲局面更將不堪設想，蘇聯勢力的仲張，不要十年，第三次大戰就更廣大更慘烈的發生了。財產問題不解決，財產矛盾不消滅，富强者不自行約束其特殊權益，被壓迫者勢必採取血的鬥爭以求生存，於是戰爭戰爭，將永久不能消弭。</p>
<p>關於財產之矛盾，我們當然不承認共產主義的觀點，因為蘇聯的工銀制度私有制度皆仍存在，證明資本主義若干制度並非蛇蝎，而為實際社會所必需。不過財產在私利性過重的時候，矛盾便要尖銳化，這樣日益擴大，最後便非戰爭不可。若財產能注意其公益性，限制了個人的私利而着重於全體的公益，財產的矛盾便可以緩和以至於消滅。為了組個財產的公益性與私利性的分別，並求限制私利性而發揮公益性，國父孫中山先生在民生主義中有「平均地梗節制資本」的規定，中國不須採取無產階級革命，沒收地主和資本家的財產，但却要限制這種財產的私利性，而發揮其公益性。所以民生主義的實現，財產對內沒有矛盾，對外也就沒有戰爭了。</p>
<p>這次繼　巴頓奧克期會談而召集的舊金山會議，討論「關於戰後一般的國際機構之提案」，任何國際的俞談會議，大國與小國的意見總是形成納鑿之勢，大國常常準備着再戰爭，小國則希望從此永保和平。重慶政府在鄧巴頓奧克斯會談提案中有　國際聯盟設置國際　察軍，　特定殖民地由國際管理，　樹立人種平等之原則，都被反對而擱置了。我們如果誠意要求和平，消弭戰爭，道三個提案都是必要的，尤其殖足地的國際管理和樹立人種平等原則，對財產之公益性的發揮有極大關係，可足英美的資本家決不肯退出優越觀念的地位，甚至他們還想獲取新的特殊權益。英美傳統的政策，在戰爭緊急關頭，對小國和殖民地不惜說盡最甜密的好話，戰爭一旦結束，便立刻反面無情，不惜採用任何手段以保護本國的財產，這時候當熱是放棄了世界的公益，而惟以其本國的少數金融巨頭的私利為依歸，所以重慶政府向英美談人種平等，談殖民地合理管理，實在無異與虎謀皮了。</p>
<p>現在世界各國財產的性質，蘇聯是重要的財產握於國家的管理之手，自然比較的能够發揮公益性而抑制私利性；中國在經濟原則上着重平均地權節制資本，將來實行成功，自然也將發揮公益性而抑制私利性；此外如日德全體主義國家，國家對於財產管制的權力日益進步，對於財產之私利性的抑制與公益性兩發揮也將毫無困難。問題却只是在英國和美國，前者是數世紀以來的老帝國，殖民地遍全球，有英國的國旗無落日之稱，後者於第一次世界大戰的時候植下了可驚的基礎，當世界各地浸沉於戰火之中的時候，美國正好乘着戰爭獲取暴利。世界財產的重點在於英美，英美沉醉於財產之無限制的膨脹，決不會顧慮到財產的性質，所謂發揮公益，抑制私利，連做夢也沒有想到呢。</p>
<p>對世界財產佔着歷史的優越地位的英美，若不遭遇敗北而能自加壓制，實屬夢想。羅斯福的召開舊金山會議，乃是想藉會議來建築他的國際領導地位，為了國際領導地位的鑄成，他也許會以最大的耐心來聽取各國的訴苦，但決不是邀請了一批對手來討論還價，為他自己加上一種束縛。不幸舊金山會議政在籌備之中，羅斯福突然逝世，會期雖不因之延改，卻已毫無精神可言，不過在　草敷衍之中，了即一重公案而已。本來羅斯福就是不死，我們也認為這個會議並不能解決財產矛盾的問題，不能解決戰爭的問題現在羅斯福死了，會議自然是籌備雖很熱烈，結束卻很潦草，出席的代表也必定是乘興而來，敗興而歸了！</p>

<h3>美蘇對渝關係複雜微妙</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電美駐渝大使哈萊，業於二日返國，其初次接見記者時，關盟對渝援助方針。渠稱，一美國承認者唯有渝政權，在軍事政治經濟上予以援助者，亦僅渝政權，故對不過是一政黨的中共，不能供給軍火。」此項聲明引起中共極大反感，如中共機關報新華日報載稱，「哈萊之聲明，必使中國分裂，造成內亂。」美國內對渝輿論的，而大獨義為民主主已的而表歡迎，以渝方為獨裁者而責其不能實現統一。美國內拉鐵摩等所謂中國通，讀塲中共為「最進步之政黨」，是以美團對此渝次共命和哈解任關。此懷停命哈萊磊使任調停兩政權料紛，企圖促使成立民主主義之新統一政權，惟以雙方主張根本不同，結果歸于失敗。美國對渝援助目標，第一在謀加强對日作戰，此固極屬明顯者，如對中共援助軍火，則無異承認中共為政黨政權，而更使兩大勞力分立，徒然浪費戰力，是以美國雖知渝方缺　甚多，但仍以渝政權認為唯一政黨政權，不惜一切援助。不共國聯援為助幕，後今，其不獲美國援助人後物更將積極拉入蘇聯勢力，而美蘇渝之關係將在中國大陸將更趨複雜微妙。</p>

<h3>美國的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 松平忠久</p>
<p>這一次特魯曼很榮耀做了白宮的生人，但我却為了他耽心。羅斯福有十二年總統經騐，他有國會政治家的資格，善於辭令，把難以應付的國會運營得很巧妙，但是新總統呢？特魯曼不過是一個出身農村的政治家，憑什麼資格做總統？所以很可想像處理國政將感到相當困難。現在試把新舊總統描出一個輸廓來加以比較。</p>
<p>羅斯福之成功條件</p>
<p>羅斯福出沈名門，生畏在適於做大政洽家的環境中，積有做大總統的必要經騐，具備一切條件。他兩度担任過最難應付的紐約州長，到五十一歲就任大總統，迄今已十二年多了；如果他不死，那麼命中註定還有三年做白宮主人的命運。在美國四次連任大總統，唯有羅斯福一人，由此一點也羅在很他美是說凡是人平凡傑出。羅斯福面貌很美，演說功夫也是第一流，尤某他的聲音富有性的魄力，使女子們亦自探不如。我們看德黑蘭會議，克里米亞會議時照片，羅斯福生在正中，右是史太林，左是邱吉爾，這或許因為史邱兩人從美國供給租借巨額軍需品及糧食，所以不得不捧他，但我想理由不止於此，恐是羅斯福的偉大，使史邱兩人表示尊敬吧。</p>
<p>但是名不經傳的特魯曼，在一九三七年出版的人各鑑上，還找不出他的大名。後來新出版的人名鑑上，雖好容易發現了哈里·特　曼，但是他五十歲以前做過什麼事業，一點沒有，記載這不是敵方通信員的惡意批評，說他是從黑暗出來的男子，此類人能做美國副大總統已經是不可思議的了，去年六月在民主黨大會中被推舉做副大總統，連他本人也做夢想不到的，這一次大總統椅子從天而降，當然使他吃驚不小。依照美國憲法明文規定，大總統逝世則由副大總統昇任，即使特魯曼自知力不勝任，也不容你隨意辭職，總之木已成舟，已無法挽回了。</p>
<p>我看到特魯曼的照片，從他每一個地方也找不出做大總統的面相；翻開紐約泰晤土週刊登着一他的履歷，我看了更加驚奇，特魯曼在第一次世界火戰時任陸軍大尉，退伍後跑到強盜賭博的都市堪薩斯去，經當地土　潘達加斯德的介紹做法院推事，直至一九三五年為止，做着這類農村政治的事；他沒有一點做大政治家的敎育和經騐，出身又低，更不配佔大總統一席位子。據他本人說不參加舊金山會議，大概他自已也不願意在大庭廣衆之問顯醜吧！在本國地方召開國際會議，各國都派代表出席，羅斯福曾經表示開幕閉幕他都要參加，但這位特魯曼先生說不出席，意思是下欲在如此大塲面上出醜，這是他本人的意思呢？還是人家替他躭憂呢？（完）</p>

<h3>本市各界昨日舉行　統一救國民衆大會　羅秘書長代表市長出席致訓</h3>
<p>本市各界民衆，為響應自都戰時民衆代表會議，於二十一日上午十時假大光明戲院，與全國各省巿同時舉行統一救國運動民衆大會。周市長適因要公晋京，特派羅秘書長蒞會致訓。本市各界民衆代表計到有保甲人員·黨員·靑少年團學生，以及各民衆團體代表等，盟邦在滬各界民衆亦到會列席，情緒極為熱烈。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>大會情形　長官方面，到有周市長代表市府羅　書長，曁各局處長蘇成德·許江·袁溶昌·徐李敦·戴英夫·周毓央·劉星辰·劉德煊·顧綱武·市保安司令部熊參謀長及市黨部主任委員劉仰山。新運分會秘書長顧森千·以及各界民衆代表袁履　·陳彬　·陳日平·周化人·陸宗遜·于明·柏曉嵐等不下二千餘人。准時開會，首由主席團主席袁履登致開會詞，繼請周市長代表羅秘書長致詞，旋由民衆代表陳日平·陳彬龢先後演說，乃宣讀大會宣言，及上重陳代主席致敬電文畢，即高呼口號，奏樂禮成。末並放映電影，至十一時半始吿散會。</p>
<p>主席致詞　大會主席袁履登致開會詞：「各位同胞，今天本市舉行統一救國運動民衆大會，同時各省市同樣在舉行這個大會。統一救國運動民衆大會，顧名思已就是要我們民衆，共同負起這個統一救國的責任，對國家旣定的國策，要協力推行，增加生產，解除民生的困苦。對於障礙應該剷除，如國積居奇，投機操縱，我們應該檢舉，以盡我們的責任。這是今天開會的宗旨，希望大家記着。開會之後，更吿訴自己的親戚朋友，大家要萬衆一心，負起本位的責任。」</p>
<p>秘書長詞　羅秘書長代表周市長訓話，略謂：「今日上海特別市舉行統一救國運動民衆大會，救國是每一國民天職，但統一不成，救國亦屬無望，人民應由心理的統一達到行動的統二，上海市政府願與全市民衆共同担負這個責任，方不負今天所舉行的統一救國運動民衆大會的意義。」</p>
<p>陳日平詞　陳日平演說行統一救國運動民衆大會，他的意義剛才羅秘書長已說得很細細，本人不必多說。最近首都舉行各省市民衆代表大會，出席各省市代表達五十多人，會期三天，提案很多，內中關於確立治安，改善民生等問題，都有詳細的討論，這在報紙上巳可見到。最重要的不外三者：　疏通物資來源，使物價下跌。　增加原料，使輾工業得維持。　疏散人口，使食糧的恐慌減少。繼該會之後，今天各省市再同時召集統一救國運動民衆大會，其意義就格外的重要。同時上海已有民意機構產生，如上海特別市市政諮詢委員會，有了這個民意機關，民意可以上達，政情可以下宣，人民應該協力政府，剷除障礙，以減輕民生苦痛，希望大家努力的做。　　陳彬龢詞陳彬龢演講：「統一救國的光決問題，是在怎樣爭取「民心」。汪故主席曾這樣說過：「我們不能忘記重慶方面大多數被桎梏的同胞，我們必須把他們解放出來，使他們和我們站在一起』。我要加上一句，就是：「我們不能忘記延安方面大多數被桎梏的同胞，我們必須把他們解放出來，使他們和我們站在一起」。怎樣爭取民心？這是國民政府的重大責任，我們期待國民政府能使重慶。延安方面被壓迫的同胞，一致歸向過來。要做到這一點，首先要得到和平區內人民的一致擁護。如何可以得到和平區人民的擁護呢？</p>
<p>第一，政治修明，換一句話說，就是和重慶延安作政治競賽，凡是重慶延安政治上失敗的，為人民所反對的，我們不能再蹈覆轍，凡是於人民有利的，而重慶延安尙未做到的，我們必須先做。</p>
<p>第二，必須解決現實問題，像如何使生產不再減低？如何使物價不再高漲？如何徹底消滅暴利和投機？如何免除戰時不必要的苦痛？等等都是。</p>
<p>第三，必須使人民參政，並且重視與論，聽取人民眞實的呼聲，容納民問可行的建設。同時必須成立民意機關，共同協力領導統一教國運動。</p>
<p>以上是對國民政府的期待。在我們人民方面，也必須改變自私·消極·取巧的態度，我們要積極協力政府實現國策，同時要求參政，一面擁護政府，一而督促政府。現在上海有一部份領導人物，仍舊保持他們的自私·消極·取巧的態度，口頭上說是反對重慶，實際上則在和平區利用戰時一切機會，求取暴利，一味投機，這種人根本沒有國家觀念，社會觀念，不但我們要排除他們，就是重慶方面也不見得會寬容他們的。</p>
<p>講到統一救國問題，必須要有强化的國民政府來領導，國民政府的强化，必須從三方面同時做起，第一是國民政府領袖本身的努力，第二是人民的擁護，第三是盟邦日本的協力。所以我們希望盟邦實踐對華新政策，實踐中日同盟條約精神，使國民政府的地位逐漸强化起來，同時配合我們的民意機關，協助推行統一救國工作。</p>
<p>最後我們談到上海的問題，近幾月來，由於周市長，羅秘書長及各長官的努力，市政方面，都在遂漸進步了，我們市民，應當同心協力，使上海成為全國的政治模範區。」</p>
<p>大會宣言　我們明白國家與人民是唇齒相關的，國家有保護人長的責任，而人民有保衛國家的義務，要求國家的生存和發展，全靠人民一致的努力。顧亭林先生曾經說過「國家興亡·匹夫有責，」所以每一個人民對於國家都是有責任的。</p>
<p>現在時局巳經到了最嚴重的階段，大東亞戰爭不但是復興中國的戰爭，也是解放全東亞民族的戰爭，唯有羣策羣力，共濟時艱，才能衝破當前的難關。首都各界民衆代表有鑒於此，為了發揚民意，對各項政治經濟文化問題提供政府參攷採納起見，發起在首都召開各省市戰時民衆代表會議，意義是非常深刻而重大。政府當局對此項會議也深致期待。</p>
<p>國府還都之初，即以和平爭取中國的自由，以反共實現中國的統一，以建國鞏固中國的獨立，我們站在民衆的立塲，對國策的施行，必須要充份協助，不容絲毫忽視。這一次會議的召集，完全出於人民的自覺，基於自發熱誠，來研討救國的對策。各省市的代表都是社會上負有聲望的人士，聚集一堂，悉心研究，對內如何外如何求獨立自主之獲得，以期集思廣益，貢獻政府，作為施政的參攷。</p>
<p>此次會議所通過的提案最重要的有兩件：第一，確定三民主義為指導原理，展開統一救國運動，全國同胞應以此為目標，集結總力以赴，放棄黨派觀念。不存地域偏見，在國家民族最高至上之原則下，聯合各黨各派，各地各界，結成統一；第二，今日國急關頭，必須政共赴事功，方能，故採納民意，為重要，官民一一心，然後可以力之革新體制，　政府制佈法令，保障人民集會自由，同時中央與地方分別設立各級民衆機關，以　人民結集全力，表達民　之組織。大會發表的宣　中　述今後民族民權民　三方面所應注意之處，而且致電世界各民族本人　同情之心呼籲和平，致　東亞各民族，本共愛東亞之旨共同奮鬥，</p>
<p>上海是全國政治，經濟，文化的中心，戰時　勵民意尤較其他各地為重要，我們為了響應首都　時民衆代表大會，特在合天召開上海特別市統一救國運動民衆大會，喚起全市民衆對當前局勢應有澈底的認識，一心一德協助政府，在陳代主席領導之下，骨謀統一一復興，外求自由解放，務使政府與人民同為爭取勝利，完遂戰爭而努力，謹此宣言。</p>

<h3>第三國僑民　居住通行限制　日憲兵當局修改辦法</h3>
<p>日本駐滬憲兵隊會於一九四二年四月一日頒佈關於在滬第三國僑民之居住及通行限制規條，對於違犯該項規條者，須予以軍法嚴懲。查近來違犯該項規條之情事頗多，犯者均巳受軍法微處，日憲兵當局，頃決定加強該項限制，特於昨（二十一）日重申禁例，冀各在滬第三國僑民予以注意。此項第三國僑民居住通行限制地區，於即日起已予以更改。至由請手續亦經修正，凡現居住於該限制區外之第三國僑民，應立即領取居住特許證，而現居住於該限制區內之第三國僑民，如欲離往該限制區外者，應事先領取通行特許證，其申請手續如下：</p>

<h3>新聞協會滬區分會　昨舉行時事演講會　請盟邦三報道部長出席演講</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會於廿一日下午五時，假外灘華懋飯店舉行時事演講會，請在滬即邦日陸海外三當局報道部長演講。計到陸軍部報道部出淵部長，艦隊報道部松島部長，大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，新聞協會區分會理事長陳彬龢，常務理事許力求，陳日平，總幹事　風等，以及各界代表達一千餘人。首由新協會區分會理事長陳彬龢致詞，繼由出淵部長，松島部畏及松平部長先後演講，最後放映德國電影「未完成之交響曲」，歷三小時始告散會。</p>
<p>主席致詞　主席陳彬龢致詞如下：「中國新聞協會上海區分會，為期各界明廖時局眞相，舉行時事演講會，今天特請日本陸海外三當局報道部長演講，承蒙光臨，不勝榮幸。上海是謠言最多的地方，製造謠言的人固然多，而輕信謠言的人也特別多。製造謠言的人為什麽這樣的多？因為上海是五方雜處極複雜的社會，敵性方面的制造謠言，投機者的製造謠言，目的是陰謀破壞，擾亂人心。投機者的製造謠言，目的是興風作浪，乘機暴利。然而一般人為什麽又輕信謠言呢？因為第一，當局及營論界對於時事動態，缺少正確的解釋。第二，一般人對於時事缺乏判斷的常識，認織又不淸，以致以訛傳訛。第三，謠言的成份，每多奇特之處，一知半解者流，引為特殊消息，繪聲繪色，若有其事，易於吸引聽衆，交相傳播。然而，不論謠言傳播所發生的影響如何，在此時局嚴重之際，不能忽視，因此，我們除在文字上解釋時局眞柏以外，並隨時舉行時事演講，防止謠言的流弊，現在請各位部長演講。」</p>
<p>出淵部長講詞</p>
<p>強化本土防衛態勢　日陸軍當局此次制定本土決戰訓，布吿全軍消息，巳見報載。此決戰訓所表示之最大精神，即為「貫徹神州不滅之信念，奉守天皇陛下之敕諭，死守天皇所在，神靈坐鎭之皇土，以期獲得勝利。為達成此目的，根據日本武人傳統之拼撞精神，誓死奪鬥，如有侵犯皇士者，悉數殺戮，使無一人生還，軍隊人員認為一億國民完遂國民戰爭之前鋒，交厚戰友情誼，顯現皇軍眞正姿態，以全護國大任。「此決戰訓之根本精神。本係日眾將士軍人精神之本體，今日不必贅言。現在戰局已入日本及大東亞全體興亡了繫有關係之一大決戰階段，且此決戰，或在日本本土展開，亦未可知，陸軍大臣鑒於此形勢，特再明示空軍，與前成立之本土總司令部及國民義勇軍等共同一致，强化本土國防態勢，是在必勝決戰之際，促全體將士奮勇　起者也。</p>
<p>實踐戰訓勇敢作戰　敵軍從瓜達卡納爾島開始總反攻以來，截至本日止，繼績猪突猛進，然敵方進攻愈接近日本本土，其困難愈大，而其損害亦隨之增加。本人斷言，在今次大東亞戰爭中，擊滅敵人之要訣，唯有一端，即殲滅敵人依靠物量來攻之人的戰力是巳。換言之，使敵美兵流盡其最後一滴之血，至其戰塲在太平洋，抑在日本本士，均不成問題。總之，沖繩戰綫之日陸海軍將士，實踐上述決戰訓，勇敢作戰，予敵以大損失，將來敵軍如有侵犯日本本土或大陸之時，即為敵人流盡其最後一滴血，不能再起之時矣。</p>
<p>敵方宣傳必歸失敗　最近美國揑造日正在菲島暴虐行為之虛偽消息，大事宣傳，尤其哈爾賽極力進行此種反宣傳，此不過係彼等隱蔽擊沉日船阿汲丸之暴虐行為，或為行將閒幕之舊金山會議，企圖謀略宣傳耳。又係彼等由硫黃島接近冲繩島時增加人與物之損失，以故作戰困難，使國民戰意衰退，故欲振作其國民戰意，煽動敵愾心之當用手段而巳。日陸軍今次布吿決戰訓，因信戰勝要訣在於殲滅美兵，重申必勝決意，至日本一億國民亦有同樣覓悟與決心，固不必贅言。同時盟邦中國及其他大東亞地域內全同胞之意氣與覺悟，亦愈熾烈且益强固，本人目路此事，殊感無一限愉快。</p>
<p>松平部長講詞</p>
<p>美人侮辱東亞人民　今日本人將美國之歷史，及美國人民之道德敎育低落情形，向各位有所講述。查上海人士對英美觀念，似反英美者少，而崇拜心理較前濃厚，其原因實由於對英美人之認識欠淸。關於美國的歷史，自立國以來，實無崇拜之處，美國乃一低落國家，當初歐洲人至美移殖者，可包括有宗敎關係之被迫者，以及失業亡命之徒與未受教育者，因此知識程度頗為低落，且時因而發生爭奪。如法國人之赴坎拿大，西班牙人之赴中南美，而墨西哥為雜色人等所薈萃之地，其後即另成為一民族，在南美亦如此。嗣後英國盎克魯撤克遜人民移殖抵美後，竟大事廝殺，排除異族，此乃美國不與其他民族合作，始終謀以武器征服其他民族之歷史，如此情形足見美國人民乃野蠻成性者。其政府亦然，當初對澳洲之手段，亦以同樣手段，斷殺征服澳洲。本人過去僑居美國時，對於美國情形較有認識，以華盛頓地方之公共汽車而述，有一次余坐該車之後部，適遇本國人吿稱切勿坐於後部，蓋軍後座位乃黑人所坐，自種人均坐於前排，雖車內未見此類吿示，但美國對黑人之能度早成為習慣。　以火車站則所，甚或都市旅社之電柫，絕對不准黑人享受。有一次余赴某大飯店進餐，突有一美人查詢余是否為中國人，倘係中國人不准入內，余以日本人對，並吿以服務大使館，始准入內。但當初美人對華人感情尙可，對日人則不然，本人很感詫異，乃多方追尋究竟，嗣經美人解答，據謂，待日人無好感者，因日人處處反抗，而華人則頗服從，　美人復以養犬為喻，侮辱殊甚，可見美國人旣有此心理，實為侮辱我東亞人民，目前美國人在重慶之情形，大致雷同，是為美國人向有之性格。</p>
<p>美國政府欺騙人民　其次：美人之好色，如聽從女言，以及與女入之共舞或苟且情形至多，約在五十年前，靑年男女在郊外野合，司空見慣，美人亦自稱彼時為野變時代，此種現象，竟延長二十年之多。前日余閱美國雜誌，其中有關婦女之寫述，最近一般婦女理家精神頗為頹喪，大都以丈夫離家服役，即與他人戀愛，故美國離婚案件日增，此項弱點，其責任在全在於美國女人，而男人亦應負之。同時政府最懼怕婦女責問，如美國有一將兵，巳在太平洋作戰中陣亡，政府方面，不將事實使其家屬獲悉，後該兵之妻向陸軍部函詢其丈夫行踪，普請調查見告，軍部獲信後，即答以汝夫頗好，現在××服役，請勿念云云。該婦逾三月後，又未接其夫來函，乃奔赴華盛頓直接向陸軍部詢問，結果又託詞刻染病疴，正在養病，不久，即可治愈，將女騙返家中。約逾時一月，政府乃函該婦，稱其夫已病死，勿必悲傷，由此種種，可見美政府欺騙其人民之一斑。</p>
<p>美人敎育程度低落　至於美人之敎育程度低落，可舉例言之，上次B29型機企圖對日轟炸，途經某地，為日軍擊落，內美兵即以降落傘落地，為日軍所捕，後日憲兵訊問該兵其奉命之目的地。該兵不識地理，僅將地圖見告，而所指之目的地並非日本，而為滿洲，可見美兵多缺乏常識，而對中國人之鄙視，更暴露無遺。有一次美雜誌調查美人對作戰之程度，結果合格者不到四分之一，大部份對作戰目標，茫無所答。</p>
<p>因此本人深望中國人民對美國不必重視，所謂美國之文明道德精神，實不能與我東亞人可比，舉凡我人之合作，必須以平等對待，而美國之對東亞人民，絕不平等。我人為改變美人之不良觀念起見，祇有以此次之作戰予以敎育，更望各位協力戰爭，改變對美人之觀念，並促成大東亞戰爭之完遂。（松島部長演講詞因篇幅較長移載第一版）</p>

<h3>Nimitz and Others to Return to Washington to Discuss the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Sea News Agency reports: There are rumors that the new U.S. President Truman intends to summon Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Army, to Washington to report on their duties.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the U.S. military began operations on Okinawa Island, it has deployed an unprecedentedly large infantry force in a single combat zone to launch an attack. However, it has been met with fierce Japanese counterattacks and has failed to achieve its objectives. Currently, the enemy fleet near Okinawa Island is using battleships, cruisers, and destroyers to bombard Japanese positions with guns of all calibers. However, due to the fierce attacks by Japanese special attack forces (referred to as "human bombs" by the enemy), the enemy's operations have encountered the greatest difficulties. It is rumored that due to the severity of the Pacific war situation, Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Army, will return to Washington in the coming days to re-examine the plans for the war against Japan.</p>
<h3>Under Favorable Circumstances, Japanese Forces Fighting Vigorously: Minister Matsushima Elaborates on the Okinawa Battle Situation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Press Association held a current affairs lecture yesterday. Minister Matsushima attended and delivered a speech, the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"It is a great honor for me to have the opportunity to meet with friends from allied nations at today's grand lecture held by the Press Association. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the current naval operations of the Imperial Navy.</p>
<p>The Significance of the Okinawa Operation is Great – Currently, the focus of the Pacific war is on the battle in the Okinawa area. The enemy, the British and Americans, have already captured Iwo Jima and are now attempting to seize Okinawa as a second base, which they intend to use as a stepping stone for aircraft to attack the Japanese mainland. They have been invading the area since March 17th. This operation has the most significant meaning in the naval operations of the Greater East Asia War, a feeling shared by both the enemy and ourselves. This operation has become the focus of the decisive battle in Greater East Asia, and it began after Japan and the Seto Inland Sea were prepared. The enemy attempted to first attack this area to disable Japanese air bases, preventing Japanese mainland aircraft from coming to aid, and to lure out and destroy our Combined Fleet, thereby advancing the operation on the island. However, the enemy underestimated our air power, a fact that will soon become apparent.</p>
<p>The Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses – The enemy, unexpectedly facing a defensive line, has found themselves in a very difficult situation. Since then, the enemy has repeatedly attacked and suffered heavy losses. However, since April 1st, approximately three divisions have landed, and in the subsequent twenty days, the operation on the island has become increasingly fierce. Since April 5th, our forces have launched several general attacks, and as of the 10th, the enemy's losses have totaled 393 ships, including approximately 20 battleships and over 20 aircraft carriers. This has a significant impact on the enemy's future operations. The enemy's personnel losses are at least 140,000, as can be seen from the rapid weakening of enemy air power in the Okinawa area. On the land front, the enemy has landed approximately six divisions, attempting to quickly seize the island, but has not yet achieved any decisive results. Since the 18th, it has been reported that the enemy has launched a German-style attack, but the result has only been bloodshed. During this period, the valiant fighting of our Kamikaze attack units and the air units of the Army and Navy has terrified the enemy and inflicted unexpected heavy losses. The sudden death of Roosevelt the other day may also be one of the reasons for the U.S. operation.</p>
<p>The Enemy is Anxious About Special Attack Units – In the past, the British have remained silent about special attack units, repeatedly denying the results of our special attack units. This shows how anxious the enemy is about our special attack units, and from the opposite perspective, we can also glimpse the fervor of public opinion in the United States. Also, in the past, the United States did not want the British fleet to participate in the Pacific operations, but this time they have requested the cooperation of the British fleet, which also proves the heavy losses suffered by the U.S. military. However, to this day, their cooperation has been ineffective, and their losses have increased. The Okinawa operation, from Japan's point of view, is progressing under extremely favorable circumstances. In their anxiety, the enemy has dispatched B-29 and P-51 aircraft from the Mariana Islands to indiscriminately attack our many air units and place them in a desperate situation. The daredevil spirit of the Japanese military is therefore even more excited.</p>
<p>China and Japan Cooperate to Achieve Their Goals – The enemy, considering the current situation in the European theater, will shift the forces from Europe to Asia to carry out the final operation. Today, although the German people are facing their last stand, in order to fundamentally destroy the international Jewish ambition to dominate the world, they continue to make superhuman efforts. As Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared, we express our infinite respect for the patriotic spirit and courage of the German army, who will fight to the last man and the last bullet, and we vow to... But in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to rely on the valiant fighting of the Japanese troops at the front and the economic support of the rear. In particular, we hope that the people of China will cooperate. The success or failure of various conditions during the war can only be determined after the war aims have been achieved. We must not be misled by enemy rumors and should immediately stabilize the local economic situation. China and Japan should cooperate to develop a common fighting power.</p>
<p>The War is Approaching its Most Important Stage – The enemy's intentions in the North Pacific are to... In India, the British fleet and air force are gradually increasing their strength; under the current circumstances, it is still impossible to predict the future direction of the operations. In short, the current state of the Pacific War has reached the most important stage of the Greater East Asia War. We should follow Sun Tzu's saying "place them in a deadly position and then they will live" and seize the opportunity to destroy the British and Americans."</p>
<h3>Launching a Unified National Salvation Movement: A Mass Rally Held in the Capital, Followed by a Procession, High Morale</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Mass Rally for the Unified National Salvation Movement in the capital was held this morning at 8:00 AM.

They shouted slogans along the way with heightened enthusiasm, and dispersed around 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Circles Comfort Detained Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – Various circles in Japan are comforting and encouraging Japanese residents detained in enemy countries. The Enemy Countries Resident Association consulted with the Council of Commerce and determined, after discussing with the Red Cross, to pack kelp and wakame and send them to Japanese residents residing in India to increase their nutrition and express their condolences.</p>
<p>A telegram to compatriots nationwide: All fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters, please take note: On the 28th of last month, the Wartime Mass Representatives Conference of various provinces and cities was held in the capital. Representatives of the national masses gathered in one hall, exchanged opinions, and jointly discussed state affairs. The resolutions passed are of great significance. In addition to sincerely supporting all the resolutions of the representatives' meeting, the citizens' congress has listed four points, requesting the government and relevant parties to implement them as soon as possible: "Unified National Salvation Movement" Our country has suffered from foreign aggression and internal warlord division, leading to a precarious national situation and the people's livelihood being difficult. The current urgent tasks are to seek internal peace and unity, oppose local divisions, seek external independence and autonomy, oppose the advantages of the great powers, and to eliminate the disturbances of the communists, which are sufficient to hinder the local "Establishment of Public Opinion Organs" National weaving, implementing local autonomy, and establishing public opinion organs are the most concrete manifestations of exerting the power of the masses, and should be realized in the short term, in order to gather all forces as a backing for the government and complete the work of restoration. "Improve People's Livelihoods" Since the incident, the people's livelihood has been extremely difficult, and the biggest reason for this is that materials have not been circulated and individuals have greedily sought exorbitant profits. For the present plan, the first step should be to open up the sources of materials and further seek reasonable control. All speculative profit-seeking illegal controls should be strictly prohibited in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. "Oppose the Great Powers' Warfare in China" Our country has suffered from successive wars, and the people have been displaced and devastated. The national strength has been exhausted. In order to seek national independence and freedom, and to seek national liberation and revival, we should strictly oppose the Great Powers using the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, and blind bombing of non-military areas is especially hated by the people of the country. Effective measures should be taken as soon as possible to prevent the motherland from falling into a state of irreparable destruction. The above points are especially appealed to all compatriots across the country to request the government and relevant parties to implement them quickly and effectively. The people are fortunate, the country is fortunate.</p>

<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>Property and War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuying</p>
<p>The enemy's long-propagated San Francisco Conference, Chongqing especially appointed Song Ziwen as the head of the delegation, and first-class figures such as Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, Hu Shi, and Wei Daoming as members, with Zhang Junli, Dong Biwu, Li Huang, and others also participating, totaling fifty people. Chongqing's serious participation in the conference, coupled with the exaggerated boasting from Britain and the United States, created the impression that this conference would have enormous power, accelerating the resolution of the current war's suffering. However, regarding the enemy's frequent conferences and talks, we have only two feelings: first, it proves that there are too many contradictions among the anti-Axis powers, and holding such conferences or talks is intended to mitigate the sharpening of these contradictions, avoiding division and conflict; second, it proves that the anti-Axis powers' war effort is insufficient, and the people are weary of war, hence the repeated holding of so-called conferences and talks to stimulate the will to fight and suppress the atmosphere of war-weariness. Moreover, another aim of Britain, the United States, and China is to deceive and rope in smaller countries, which is certainly not a waste of effort, but if weak countries and colonies overemphasize these conferences and talks, or harbor wishful thinking and reliance, they will inevitably be greatly deceived. Throughout history, the beginning and ending of wars, apart from various emotion-related actions, have always been centered on the issue of property. Human enjoyment cannot be separated from property, and the activities, fights, crimes, and even various internal strife, large-scale domestic wars, and world wars that arise from human enjoyment are inextricably linked to the issue of property. Looking at the crux of the current great war, firstly, in Asia, Japan's progress in the hundred years since the Meiji Restoration and its economic development have been deeply constrained, with almost all parts of Asia restricted by the power of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. The September 18th Incident was Japan's helpless attempt to seek development in Manchuria. Instead of considering lifting the restrictions on the entirety of Asia, Britain and the United States only knew how to instigate China's resistance against Japan, vainly hoping to profit from the sidelines. As a result, the war's expansion eventually became uncontrollable. Secondly, in Europe, Germany, after its defeat in 1914, was burdened by the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, leaving Germany impoverished and without a way out. In contrast, the wealth and superiority of Britain, the United States, and France highlighted a stark contrast, with some drowning in wine and meat while others starved by the roadside. If Britain and the United States had respected humanity and justice, they should have thoroughly corrected this long ago. But in fact, they first wanted to use Germany to restrain the Soviet Union, then wanted to suppress Germany, and finally even allied with the Soviet Union to eliminate Germany. However, we know that if Germany is truly eliminated, the situation in Europe will be even more unimaginable. The expansion of Soviet power will, in less than ten years, lead to a third world war that is even broader and more tragic. If the property issue is not resolved, if property contradictions are not eliminated, and if the rich and powerful do not restrain their special interests, the oppressed will inevitably resort to bloody struggles for survival. Thus, war after war will never be eliminated.</p>
<p>Regarding the contradictions of property, we certainly do not recognize the views of communism, because the Soviet Union's wage system and private property system still exist, proving that certain systems of capitalism are not venomous snakes but are necessary for a practical society. However, when property becomes excessively self-serving, contradictions will sharpen, expanding until war becomes inevitable. If property can focus on its public nature, limiting individual self-interest and emphasizing the overall public good, the contradictions of property can be mitigated or even eliminated. To distinguish between the public and private nature of property and to limit private interest while promoting public interest, Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, included the provisions of "equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital" in his Principle of People's Livelihood. China does not need to adopt a proletarian revolution to confiscate the property of landlords and capitalists, but it must limit the self-serving nature of this property and promote its public benefit. Therefore, with the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, property will have no internal contradictions, and there will be no external wars.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference, convened following the Dumbarton Oaks talks, is discussing "proposals for a general international organization after the war." In any international negotiation, the opinions of large and small countries always create a conflict. Large countries are often preparing for further war, while small countries hope to maintain peace forever. In the Dumbarton Oaks talks proposals, the Chongqing government proposed the establishment of an international gendarmerie by the League of Nations, international administration of specific colonies, and the establishment of the principle of racial equality, all of which were opposed and shelved. If we sincerely demand peace and eliminate war, these three proposals are all necessary. In particular, the international administration of colonies and the establishment of the principle of racial equality are of great relevance to the promotion of the public benefit of property. However, British and American capitalists are determined not to abandon their superior views, and even want to acquire new special interests. Britain and the United States' traditional policy is that in times of war emergency, they will not hesitate to say the sweetest words to small countries and colonies, but once the war ends, they immediately turn ruthless, not hesitating to adopt any means to protect their national property. At this time, they naturally abandon the public good of the world and only rely on the self-interest of their own few financial giants. Therefore, it is futile for the Chongqing government to talk to Britain and the United States about racial equality and the rational management of colonies.</p>
<p>Regarding the nature of property in various countries of the world today, in the Soviet Union, important property is in the hands of the state, which naturally enables it to better promote public benefit and suppress private interest; China, in its economic principles, emphasizes equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital, and if successfully implemented in the future, will naturally also promote public benefit and suppress private interest. In addition, in totalitarian states like Japan and Germany, the state's power to control property is increasingly advanced, making it easy to suppress the private interest of property and promote its public benefit. The problem lies with Britain and the United States. The former is an old empire of centuries, with colonies all over the world, boasting that "the sun never sets on the British flag." The latter laid a startling foundation during World War I, and while the world was mired in war, the United States took advantage of the war to reap huge profits. The focus of the world's property lies in Britain and the United States, and they are intoxicated by the unrestricted expansion of property, and will never consider the nature of property, let alone promoting public benefit and suppressing private interest. They have not even dreamed of it.</p>
<p>For Britain and the United States, which occupy a historically superior position in the world's property, it is a dream to expect them to restrain themselves without suffering defeat. Roosevelt convened the San Francisco Conference to build his international leadership position through the conference. To forge this international leadership position, he may listen to the grievances of various countries with the greatest patience, but he is definitely not inviting a group of opponents to discuss prices and add a kind of restriction to himself. Unfortunately, while the San Francisco Conference was in preparation, Roosevelt suddenly passed away. Although the conference schedule was not delayed, it was devoid of spirit. At best, it would be a perfunctory end to a public matter. Originally, even if Roosevelt had not died, we believed that this conference could not solve the problem of property contradictions, and could not solve the problem of war. Now that Roosevelt is dead, the conference, while preparations were enthusiastic, will naturally end hastily, and the attending representatives will surely come with excitement and leave with disappointment!</p>
<h3>This Year's Construction Policy for Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction believes that the province's construction undertakings are complex and require vigorous promotion. Therefore, it has specially formulated a construction policy for the 34th year of the Republic, divided into four categories: transportation, water conservancy, industry and commerce, and agriculture and forestry, to be promoted in phases.</p>
<h3>Periodic Grand Review of Zhejiang Youth</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) The Zhejiang Provincial Headquarters of the Chinese Youth League will celebrate Youth Day on May 3rd. In addition to sending representatives to Beijing to participate in the National Youth League Grand Review before that date, it will also hold the third provincial Youth League Grand Review, which is currently being actively prepared.</p>
<h3>Complex and Subtle Relations Between the United States and the Soviet Union Towards Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, returned to the United States on the 2nd. In his first meeting with reporters, regarding the Allied policy of assistance to Chongqing, he stated, "The United States only recognizes the Chongqing regime. Military, political, and economic assistance is only provided to the Chongqing regime. Therefore, military supplies cannot be provided to the Chinese Communist Party, which is only a political party." This statement aroused great resentment from the Chinese Communist Party. For example, the CCP's official newspaper, Xinhua Daily, carried a statement saying, "Hurley's statement will inevitably cause division in China and create internal strife." Public opinion in the United States towards Chongqing is divided, with some welcoming it as a defender of democracy, while others criticizing Chongqing for being dictatorial and unable to achieve unity. Some so-called China experts in the United States, such as Lattimore, regard the CCP as the "most progressive party." Therefore, the United States sent Hurley to mediate between the Chongqing and Communist parties, attempting to promote the establishment of a new unified regime based on democracy. However, due to the fundamentally different positions of both sides, it ended in failure. The United States' goal in assisting Chongqing is primarily to strengthen the war against Japan, which is extremely obvious. However, providing military supplies to the CCP would be tantamount to recognizing the CCP as a political party and government, further dividing the two major forces and wasting combat power. Therefore, although the United States knows that Chongqing is facing many difficulties, it still regards the Chongqing regime as the only political power and spares no effort in assisting it. If the CCP does not receive assistance from the United States, it will actively draw more people and resources into the Soviet sphere of influence, and the relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing will become more complex and subtle on the Chinese mainland.</p>

<h3>America's Anguish</h3>
<p>— Matsudaira Tadahisa</p>
<p>This time, Truman was honored to become an occupant of the White House, but I am worried about him. Roosevelt had twelve years of presidential experience, and he had the qualifications of a congressional politician, adept at rhetoric, and skillfully managed the difficult-to-handle Congress. But what about the new president? Truman is just a politician from a rural background. What qualifications does he have to be president? So, it is conceivable that he will find it quite difficult to handle national affairs. Now, let's try to compare the new and old presidents to draw an outline.</p>
<p>Conditions for Roosevelt's Success</p>
<p>Roosevelt came from a distinguished family and grew up in an environment suitable for becoming a great politician, accumulating the necessary experience to become a great president, and possessing all the conditions. He served twice as the notoriously difficult Governor of New York, and became president at the age of fifty-one, and has been so for more than twelve years. If he hadn't died, he would have been destined to be the master of the White House for another three years. Only Roosevelt has been elected president four times in the United States, from which it can be said that Roosevelt was an outstanding person. Roosevelt had a beautiful face and was also a first-class speaker. In particular, his voice was full of sexual power, making women feel inferior. When we look at the photos of the Tehran Conference and the Crimean Conference, Roosevelt is in the center, with Stalin on the right and Churchill on the left. Perhaps this is because Stalin and Churchill received huge amounts of military supplies and food from the United States under Lend-Lease, so they had to flatter him, but I think the reason is more than that. I am afraid it was Roosevelt's greatness that made Stalin and Churchill show respect.</p>
<p>However, the unknown Truman could not be found in the Who's Who published in 1937. Later, although Harry Truman was finally found in the newly published Who's Who, there is no record of what he did before the age of fifty. This is not the malicious criticism of an enemy correspondent, saying that he is a man who came out of darkness. It is already incredible that this kind of person could become the Vice President of the United States. He was nominated as the Vice President at the Democratic Party Congress last June, which even he himself did not expect. This time, the president's chair fell from the sky, which naturally surprised him a lot. According to the clear provisions of the U.S. Constitution, if the president dies, the vice president will be promoted. Even if Truman knows that he is not capable of doing the job, he is not allowed to resign at will. In short, what is done is done, and there is no way to undo it.</p>
<p>When I saw Truman's photo, I couldn't find the face of a president anywhere on him. When I opened the New York Times Magazine with his resume, I was even more surprised. Truman served as an army captain in World War I. After retiring, he ran to the gangster gambling city of Kansas, and was introduced by the local gangster Pendergast to become a court judge, doing this kind of rural political work until 1935. He has no education or experience to be a great politician, comes from a low background, and is even more unworthy of occupying the seat of president. According to himself, he will not attend the San Francisco Conference. Perhaps he himself does not want to show his ugliness in public! When an international conference is held in the country, all countries send representatives to attend. Roosevelt once said that he would attend both the opening and closing ceremonies, but this Mr. Truman said that he would not attend. Does this mean that he does not want to be embarrassed on such a large scale? Is this his own idea? Or are people worried about him? (The End)</p>

<h3>The Various Circles of Our City Held the United National Salvation Mass Meeting Yesterday; Secretary-General Luo Attended on Behalf of the Mayor to Deliver Instructions</h3>
<p>The people from various circles of our city, in response to the wartime people's representative conference held in the capital, held a united national salvation movement mass meeting at the Great Light Theater at 10:00 AM on the 21st, simultaneously with various provinces and cities across the country. As Mayor Zhou was going to the capital for official business, he specially sent Secretary-General Luo to the meeting to deliver instructions. People's representatives from various circles in our city, including Baojia personnel, party members, student youth groups, and representatives of various people's organizations, were present. People from various allied countries in Shanghai also attended as observers, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: On the officials' side, those present included Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou and the city government, as well as bureau chiefs Su Chengde, Xu Jiang, Yuan Rongchang, Xu Lidun, Dai Yingfu, Zhou Yuyang, Liu Xingchen, Liu Dexuan, Gu Gangwu, Chief of Staff Xiong of the Municipal Security Command, and Chairman Liu Yangshan of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Secretary-General Gu Senchen of the New Life Movement Branch, and people's representatives Yuan Lü, Chen Bin, Chen Riping, Zhou Huarin, Lu Zongxun, Yu Ming, Bai Xiaolan, and others, totaling more than two thousand people. The meeting started on time, with Chairman Yuan Lüdeng of the presidium delivering the opening remarks. He was followed by Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, who delivered a speech. Then, people's representatives Chen Riping and Chen Binhe gave speeches one after another. The declaration of the congress was then read out, followed by a telegram of respect to Acting Chairman Chen. Slogans were shouted, music was played, and the ceremony was completed. A film was screened at the end, and the meeting adjourned at half-past eleven.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Yuan Lüdeng of the congress delivered the opening speech: "Fellow countrymen, today our city is holding a united national salvation movement mass meeting, and at the same time, other provinces and cities are holding the same meeting. The United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting, as the name suggests, is to ask us, the people, to jointly assume the responsibility of united national salvation. We must cooperate in implementing the established national policy of the country, increase production, and alleviate the suffering of the people. We should eradicate obstacles, such as hoarding and speculation, and report them to fulfill our responsibilities. This is the purpose of today's meeting, and I hope everyone will remember it. After the meeting, tell your relatives and friends that we must unite as one and take responsibility for our respective positions."</p>
<p>Secretary-General's Speech: Secretary-General Luo, representing Mayor Zhou, gave instructions, saying in brief: "Today, Shanghai Special Municipality is holding a united national salvation movement mass meeting. Saving the country is the duty of every citizen, but without unity, saving the country is hopeless. The people should achieve unity in action through unity in mind. The Shanghai Municipal Government is willing to shoulder this responsibility together with all the citizens, so as not to fail the meaning of today's united national salvation movement mass meeting."</p>
<p>Chen Riping's Speech: Chen Riping spoke on the united national salvation movement mass meeting. Secretary-General Luo has already spoken in detail about its meaning, so I don't need to say more. Recently, the capital held a people's representative conference of various provinces and cities, attended by more than 50 representatives from various provinces and cities. The conference lasted for three days and had many proposals, including detailed discussions on establishing security and improving people's livelihoods. This can already be seen in the newspapers. The most important things are no more than three: - Unblocking the source of materials to reduce prices. - Increasing raw materials to maintain the textile industry. - Dispersing the population to reduce the panic of food shortages. Following this conference, today, various provinces and cities are holding the United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting at the same time, and its significance is even more important. At the same time, Shanghai has a public opinion institution, such as the Shanghai Special Municipal Municipal Advisory Committee. With this public opinion institution, public opinion can reach the top, and the political situation can be announced to the bottom. The people should cooperate with the government to eliminate obstacles and reduce the suffering of the people. I hope everyone will work hard."</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech: Chen Binhe spoke: "The key to the 'light or dark' problem of unified national salvation lies in how to win 'popular support'. The late Chairman Wang once said, 'We must not forget the majority of our compatriots who are shackled in Chongqing. We must liberate them and make them stand with us.' I want to add one sentence, that is: 'We must not forget the majority of our compatriots who are shackled in Yan'an. We must liberate them and make them stand with us.' How to win popular support? This is a major responsibility of the National Government. We expect the National Government to make the oppressed compatriots in Chongqing and Yan'an unanimously return. To achieve this, we must first obtain the unanimous support of the people in the peaceful areas. How can we obtain the support of the people in the peaceful areas?</p>
<p>First, the political system must be enlightened. In other words, we must compete politically with Chongqing and Yan'an. We must not repeat the political failures of Chongqing and Yan'an that are opposed by the people. We must do what is beneficial to the people that Chongqing and Yan'an have not yet done first.</p>
<p>Second, we must solve practical problems, such as how to prevent production from declining further, how to prevent prices from rising further, how to completely eliminate profiteering and speculation, and how to avoid unnecessary wartime suffering, etc.</p>
<p>Third, we must allow the people to participate in politics, value public opinion, listen to the true voices of the people, and accept feasible suggestions from the people. At the same time, we must establish public opinion institutions to jointly lead the unified national salvation movement.</p>
<p>The above are expectations for the National Government. On the part of our people, we must also change our selfish, passive, and opportunistic attitudes. We must actively cooperate with the government to implement national policies, demand political participation, support the government on the one hand, and urge the government on the other. There are still some leading figures in Shanghai who maintain their selfish, passive, and opportunistic attitudes. They say they oppose Chongqing, but in fact, they use all opportunities in the peaceful areas during the war to seek exorbitant profits and engage in speculation. These people have no concept of the country or society. Not only do we have to exclude them, but Chongqing may not tolerate them either.</p>
<p>Speaking of the issue of unified national salvation, there must be a strengthened National Government to lead it. The strengthening of the National Government must start from three aspects at the same time. The first is the efforts of the leaders of the National Government themselves, the second is the support of the people, and the third is the cooperation of the allied country of Japan. Therefore, we hope that the allied country will implement its new policy towards China, implement the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and gradually strengthen the position of the National Government, while at the same time cooperating with our public opinion institutions to assist in promoting the unified national salvation work.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the issue of Shanghai. In recent months, thanks to the efforts of Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and other officials, the municipal administration has been gradually progressing. We citizens should work together to make Shanghai a national model political zone."</p>
<p>Declaration of the Congress: We understand that the country and the people are closely related. The country has the responsibility to protect the people, and the people have the obligation to defend the country. The survival and development of the country depend entirely on the concerted efforts of the people. Mr. Gu Tinglin once said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country." Therefore, every citizen has a responsibility to the country.</p>
<p>Now, the situation has reached its most serious stage. The Greater East Asia War is not only a war to revive China, but also a war to liberate all the nations of East Asia. Only by pooling our efforts and working together to overcome difficulties can we break through the current difficulties. The people's representatives of various circles in the capital, in view of this, in order to promote public opinion and provide the government with reference for adopting various political, economic, and cultural issues, initiated the convening of a wartime people's representative conference of various provinces and cities in the capital. The significance is very profound and significant. The government authorities also deeply expect this meeting.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the return of the National Government to the capital, it used peace to strive for China's freedom, anti-communism to realize China's unification, and nation-building to consolidate China's independence. Standing on the position of the people, we must fully assist in the implementation of the national policy and allow no negligence. The convening of this meeting is entirely out of the people's awareness, based on spontaneous enthusiasm, to discuss the countermeasures for saving the country. Representatives from various provinces and cities are all reputable people in the society, gathered together to study carefully, how to seek independence and autonomy internally and externally, in order to gather wisdom and contribute to the government as a reference for policy implementation.</p>
<p>The most important of the proposals passed at this meeting are two: First, determine the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle, launch a unified national salvation movement, and all compatriots in the country should take this as the goal, gather all their strength to go, abandon party concepts, and have no regional prejudice, under the highest principle of the country and the nation, unite all parties and factions, all regions and all circles, and form a unity; Second, at the critical juncture of the country today, it is necessary to govern together to achieve success, so adopting public opinion is important, and officials and people are of one mind, and then they can use their strength to reform the system. The government promulgates laws and regulations to protect the people's freedom of assembly, and at the same time, the central and local governments establish people's organizations at all levels to organize the people to gather all their strength and express their opinions. The declaration issued by the congress stated the points that should be paid attention to in the three aspects of the nation, people's rights, and people's livelihoods in the future, and also sent a telegram to the people of all nations in the world with a heart of sympathy, calling for peace, and to the people of East Asia, fighting together for the common cause of loving East Asia.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of national politics, economy, and culture. It is even more important to encourage public opinion during wartime than in other places. In order to respond to the wartime people's representative conference in the capital, we specially convened the Shanghai Special Municipal United National Salvation Movement Mass Meeting today to awaken all citizens' thorough understanding of the current situation, help the government wholeheartedly, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, discuss unity, restoration, and seek freedom and liberation externally, so that the government and the people work together to strive for victory and complete the war. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Economic Bureau Set a Deadline for the Registration of Major Commodities; Failure to Register After the Deadline Will Be Punished as Hoarding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to suppress prices and curb hoarding, was ordered to register major commodities. From April 15th to May 14th, all merchants dealing in major commodities should register their inventories of designated major commodities within the deadline. The bureau also convened various trade associations of major commodities to explain the purpose of the major commodity registration and instructed the trade associations to urge their members to comply. Now, the associations have issued letters to their member merchants to handle the matter jointly. According to the reporter's inquiry to the bureau, if merchants have major commodities but fail to apply for registration within the deadline, they will be regarded as hoarding materials and punished according to law if discovered after the deadline. The association authorities will also be subject to appropriate penalties for member merchants.</p>
<p>Finance Bureau Supplements Business Registration: Recently, the Municipal Finance Bureau felt that the amount of special consumption tax collected by various merchants on behalf of the government was far short of the monthly collection amount in light of the current market situation. In addition to sending a large number of staff to strictly investigate and prosecute any concealment or evasion, it also found that the urban area was vast and it was difficult to investigate the establishment and closure of stores. Therefore, it requested the municipal government to issue a notice to supplement the business registration within a time limit. All stores in the city that have not yet filled out the application form for registration, as well as those who have not reported and paid the special consumption tax, should apply for registration at the competent branch within the time limit to avoid punishment.</p>
<h3>Household Oil Rationing Planned for Distribution at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>

The office has now reached an agreement with the relevant authorities to decide on the method of supplying a part of the allocation oil. The deficit will be supplemented by cooking oil vendors. It is expected to be distributed at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Special Sugar Allocation for This Period Approved for Distribution</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association has adjusted the distribution of special rationed sugar, which is still distributed through the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office. The total amount for this period is about 900+ stones. The office has now notified various agencies to pay and receive the allocation according to the approved quantity from today.</p>

<h3>The Construction Bureau Plans to Build Highways and Bridges</h3>
<p>In order to assist in the work of dispersing the population, the Municipal Construction Bureau has actively rectified the city's land and water transportation to facilitate the safety of travelers. It is planned to repair the highways connecting the city to various counties, such as the Xihu, Jialuo, Hutai, Luohuan, Suhu, and Shangsong roads, as well as bridges. After the bureau sent personnel to survey the results, it is now preparing a plan to submit to the municipal government for repairs in the short term.</p>
<p>Revised Building Permit Fee: The Municipal Construction Bureau previously revised the fees for various construction, installation of sanitary facilities, and renovation, repair, painting, demolition, and shed erection permits set by the former Works Bureau, which are now ineffective. After being approved by the municipal government, it will be collected according to the newly revised fee amount from the first day of next month. The adjusted collection fee includes a 3.5 to 6 times increase in various building permit fees, a 3 to 6 times increase in various sanitary equipment permit fees, and a 4 to 8 times increase in renovation, repair, painting, demolition, and shed erection permit fees. The industry association issued a notice to its members yesterday, and the implementation of the collection will be implemented on the scheduled date.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Held a Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its fifth joint meeting of all directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM on the 20th. More than 20 directors and supervisors attended, chaired by Chairman Yuan Lüdeng and Supervisor Wen Lanting. The report items included temporary relief bonds, industrial and commercial parity rice, and revenue and expenditure expenses. The discussion items included the resignation of Standing Director Qin Runqing due to old age and illness. It was resolved to continue to invite him to serve as a director. Director Zhang Shufang was elected to succeed him as standing director. In addition, issues such as assisting the development of industry and commerce, the treatment of the association's employees, a tentative list of labor dispute arbitration committee members, and the application of public store for membership were discussed and decided separately after careful exchange of opinions.</p>
<h3>Outstanding Police Officers Separately Rewarded and Promoted</h3>
<p>Since Director Zhou took office in the Municipal Police Bureau, he has issued a plan to improve police administration, implement organizational adjustments, refresh personnel, and improve treatment, which have been completed in stages. Director Zhou is particularly concerned about rewarding outstanding police officers and improving police welfare. It is learned that the bureau has decided to strengthen its work and encourage outstanding employees. Those who have worked hard and achieved excellent results will be promoted regardless of nationality to encourage them.

It is also scheduled to issue 3 catties of cheap cooking oil (priced at 490 yuan) and 20 cigarettes (each Kaimi 2 yuan and Shuangqiang brand 5 corners) to police officers and servants tomorrow (23rd).</p>
<h3>The Contribution Society Stops Accepting Contributions from the Entertainment Industry</h3>
<p>The various entertainment industry associations in the city had previously made voluntary contributions to respond to the development of the city's New Life Movement work and other mass movements. The Municipal Party Department and the New Life Movement Association have a "Contribution Office Now Committee". Since the central government has planned funds for the above-mentioned work, there is no need to use public contributions. Therefore, the association has stopped accepting the contributions from April. If anyone collects money in the name of the above-mentioned items, the associations or merchants should appeal to the competent authorities.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Residence and Passage of Third-Country Nationals; The Japanese Gendarmerie Authorities Revise the Measures</h3>
<p>The Japanese Gendarmerie in Shanghai promulgated regulations on the residence and passage restrictions for third-country nationals in Shanghai on April 1, 1942. Those who violated the regulations were subject to severe military law punishment. It has been found that there have been many incidents of violation of the regulations recently, and the offenders have been subject to military law punishment. The Japanese Gendarmerie authorities have recently decided to strengthen the restrictions and reiterated the prohibition on the 21st, hoping that all third-country nationals in Shanghai will pay attention to it. The restricted areas for the residence and passage of third-country nationals have been changed from today. The application procedures have also been revised. All third-country nationals who currently reside outside the restricted area should immediately obtain a residence permit, and third-country nationals who currently reside inside the restricted area who want to leave the restricted area should obtain a passage permit in advance. The application procedures are as follows:</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to obtain a residence permit must present a residence certificate from the consular authorities of their country and three photos of the applicant to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Gendarmerie on Guangdong Road. Anyone who wants to obtain a passage permit must state the reason for the application to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Gendarmerie on Guangdong Road, and must be certified by the consular authorities of the applicant's country or other countries or individuals of the same status, and three photos of the applicant. Third-country nationals who want to leave the Shanghai area for travel should still apply for permission from the Japanese Naval Attaché or the Special Envoy of the National Government as in the past.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Will Suspend Savings Business</h3>
<p>The Donglai and Yongda banks in the city have announced the suspension of savings department business and have notified all savings account holders to withdraw their deposits from today, otherwise they will be transferred to the commercial department for handling. The Central News Agency reporter learned from the financial circles yesterday that the savings business of various commercial savings banks has developed greatly in the past, and the amount of savings funds received is very large. However, in recent years, prices have risen, and it is difficult for banks and money shops to use the savings funds they absorb. The interest on savings accounts is also very low. In addition, speculation is rampant, and those who seek exorbitant profits are emerging one after another. Therefore, most depositors are withdrawing their savings one after another, so that the statistics of savings in various banks and shops have been reduced to more than 90% compared with the past. All savings departments seem to be nominal. In order to save expenses, there is a move to suspend the savings business. Not only the above two banks are like this, but other banks and shops are also preparing to suspend savings business. All unfinished matters of the savings department will be handled by the commercial department. It is expected that the commercial savings banks will focus on commercial business and receive deposits from depositors.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the News Association Holds a Current Affairs Speech Meeting, Inviting Three Allied Nations' Press Officers to Speak</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a current affairs speech meeting at the Waibaidu Bridge Cathay Hotel at 5 p.m. on the 21st. Press officers from the three authorities in Shanghai, namely Japan's Army, Navy, and Embassy, were invited to speak. Among those present were Army Press Officer Izubuchi, Navy Press Officer Matsushima, Shanghai Office of the Embassy Information Officer Matsudaira, Chairman of the News Association's Shanghai Branch Chen Binhe, Executive Directors Xu Liqiu and Chen Riping, General Secretary Feng, and over a thousand representatives from various circles. The meeting began with a speech by Chen Binhe, Chairman of the News Association's Shanghai Branch, followed by speeches from Officer Izubuchi, Officer Matsushima, and Officer Matsudaira. Finally, the German film "Unfinished Symphony" was screened. The meeting lasted three hours before adjourning.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Binhe's speech was as follows: "The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, in order to allow all sectors to understand the truth of the current situation, is holding this current affairs speech meeting. Today, we have specially invited the press officers from the three Japanese authorities, the Army, Navy, and Embassy, to speak, and we are extremely honored by their presence. Shanghai is the place with the most rumors. There are many people who create rumors, and there are also particularly many people who readily believe them. Why are there so many people who create rumors? Because Shanghai is an extremely complex society where people from all walks of life gather. Those on the enemy side create rumors with the aim of conspiring to sabotage and disturb people's minds. Speculators create rumors with the aim of stirring up trouble and profiting from the chaos. However, why do people generally readily believe rumors? Firstly, the authorities and the press lack correct explanations of current affairs. Secondly, the general public lacks common sense in judging current events, and their understanding is unclear, leading to the spread of misinformation. Thirdly, rumors often contain strange and peculiar elements. Those who only have a superficial understanding treat them as special news, embellishing them vividly, as if they were real, easily attracting audiences and spreading them from person to person. However, no matter what impact the spread of rumors has, it cannot be ignored at this critical juncture. Therefore, in addition to explaining the truth of the current situation in writing, we also hold current affairs speeches from time to time to prevent the abuses of rumors. Now, please listen to the speeches of the ministers."</p>
<p>Speech by Officer Izubuchi</p>
<p>Strengthening the Homeland Defense Posture</p>
<p>The Japanese Army authorities have recently formulated the "Homeland Decisive Battle Training," and the news of its promulgation to the entire army has already been reported. The greatest spirit expressed in this decisive battle training is to "carry through the belief that the divine land will never perish, abide by the Emperor's edict, defend the Emperor's residence, the sacred land where the spirits reside, to achieve victory. To achieve this goal, based on the spirit of reckless collision in the Japanese warrior tradition, we pledge to fight to the death, and if anyone invades the imperial soil, they will be exterminated, so that not a single person will survive. The military personnel believe that the 100 million people are the vanguard in completing the national war, emphasizing deep wartime friendships, showing the true posture of the Imperial Army, to fully protect the country." This is the fundamental spirit of the "decisive battle training." It is the essence of the spirit of the Japanese soldiers and officers, and there is no need to elaborate on it today. The current war situation has entered a major decisive battle stage related to the rise and fall of Japan and the entire Greater East Asia, and this decisive battle may even unfold on Japanese soil. In light of this situation, the Minister of the Army has clearly instructed the Air Force, together with the previously established Homeland General Command and the National Volunteer Corps, to jointly strengthen the homeland defense posture, which is to encourage all soldiers to bravely rise up at the time of the decisive battle for victory.</p>
<p>Practicing War Training and Fighting Bravely</p>
<p>Since the enemy forces began their general counteroffensive from Guadalcanal Island, they have continued to advance recklessly until today. However, the closer the enemy's offensive gets to the Japanese homeland, the greater their difficulties and the greater their losses will be. I assert that the key to destroying the enemy in this Greater East Asia War lies in one thing: annihilating the enemy's combat power, which relies on material resources to attack. In other words, making the American soldiers shed their last drop of blood, whether the battlefield is in the Pacific or on Japanese soil, is not a problem. In short, the Japanese Army and Navy soldiers on the Okinawa front are practicing the above-mentioned decisive battle training, fighting bravely, and inflicting great losses on the enemy. In the future, when the enemy forces invade the Japanese mainland or the continent, it will be when the enemy sheds their last drop of blood and can no longer rise again.</p>
<p>Enemy Propaganda Will Inevitably Fail</p>
<p>Recently, the United States fabricated false news of Japan's tyrannical behavior in the Philippines and publicized it widely. Halsey, in particular, is vigorously carrying out this kind of counter-propaganda, which is merely to conceal their tyrannical behavior of sinking the Japanese ship Awaji Maru, or to attempt to propagandize for the soon-to-be-closed San Francisco Conference. It is also because they have suffered increasing losses of people and materials as they approach Okinawa from Iwo Jima, making combat difficult and weakening the people's will to fight. Therefore, they want to boost their people's will to fight and incite hatred of the enemy as a means to be used. The Japanese Army has now promulgated the decisive battle training, because it believes that the key to victory lies in annihilating the American soldiers, reiterating its determination to win. It goes without saying that Japan's 100 million people also have the same understanding and determination. At the same time, the spirit and awareness of our allied country China and all our compatriots in other Greater East Asian regions are becoming more intense and stronger. I am extremely pleased to witness this.</p>
<p>Speech by Officer Matsudaira</p>
<p>Americans Insult the People of East Asia</p>
<p>Today, I will tell you about the history of the United States and the low moral education of the American people. It seems that there are fewer anti-British and anti-American people in Shanghai, and the worship mentality is stronger than before. The reason is that the understanding of British and Americans is not clear. Regarding the history of the United States, there is really nothing to worship since its founding. The European immigrants to the United States initially included those who were persecuted due to religious reasons, as well as the unemployed, fugitives, and uneducated people. Therefore, the level of knowledge was quite low, and disputes often arose. For example, the French went to Canada, the Spanish went to Central and South America, and Mexico is a place where people of mixed races gather, which later became a separate nation, and the same is true in South America. Later, after the British Anglo-Saxon people immigrated to the United States, they engaged in large-scale killings and eliminated other ethnic groups. This is the history of the United States not cooperating with other ethnic groups and always trying to conquer other ethnic groups with weapons. This situation shows that the American people are inherently barbaric. The same is true of their government. The same methods were used against Australia at the beginning, killing and conquering Australia. When I lived in the United States in the past, I had a better understanding of the situation in the United States. Taking the public bus in Washington, D.C. as an example, once I sat in the back of the bus, and a compatriot told me not to sit in the back, because the seats in the back were for black people, and white people all sat in the front row. Although there were no such signs in the bus, the American tolerance of black people had long become a habit. In train stations, or even elevators in urban hotels, black people were absolutely not allowed to enjoy them. Once, I went to a large hotel for a meal, and suddenly an American asked me if I was Chinese. If I was Chinese, I would not be allowed to enter. I said that I was Japanese and told him that I was serving in the embassy, so I was allowed to enter. However, at first, the Americans' feelings towards the Chinese were still acceptable, but not towards the Japanese. I was very surprised and tried to find out the reason. After the Americans explained, they said that they had no good feelings towards the Japanese because the Japanese resisted everywhere, while the Chinese were quite obedient. The Americans further used the metaphor of raising dogs to insult them very much. It can be seen that the Americans already have this mentality, which is an insult to the people of East Asia. The current situation of Americans in Chongqing is roughly the same, which is the inherent character of Americans.</p>
<p>The American Government Deceives the People</p>
<p>Secondly, the Americans are fond of women, such as listening to women's words, and having dances or illicit relationships with women are very common. About fifty years ago, it was common for young men and women to have affairs in the suburbs. The Americans themselves called that time the wild age. This phenomenon lasted for as long as twenty years. The other day, I read an American magazine in which it was written about women that the spirit of housekeeping among general women has been quite depressed recently. Most of them have affairs with others after their husbands leave home to serve in the military. Therefore, the number of divorce cases in the United States is increasing day by day. The responsibility for this weakness lies entirely with American women, and men should also bear it. At the same time, the government is most afraid of women's accusations. For example, there is an American soldier who has died in battle in the Pacific. The government did not inform his family of the facts. Later, the soldier's wife sent a letter to the Department of the Army to inquire about her husband's whereabouts and asked for an investigation to inform her. After the Department of the Army received the letter, it replied that your husband is doing well and is now serving in ××. Please don't worry. After three months, the woman did not receive a letter from her husband, so she rushed to Washington to directly ask the Department of the Army. As a result, they again made excuses that he was currently suffering from illness and was recuperating and would be cured soon, and tricked the woman back home. About a month later, the government sent a letter to the woman, saying that her husband had died of illness and not to be sad. From these various things, it can be seen that the American government is deceiving its people.</p>
<p>The American Education Level is Low</p>
<p>As for the low education level of Americans, an example can be given. The last time a B29 type aircraft attempted to bomb Japan, it passed through a certain place and was shot down by the Japanese army. The American soldiers landed by parachute and were captured by the Japanese army. Later, the Japanese military police interrogated the soldier about his ordered destination. The soldier did not know the geography and only showed the map, and the destination he pointed to was not Japan, but Manchuria. It can be seen that many American soldiers lack common sense, and their contempt for the Chinese is even more exposed. Once, an American magazine investigated the level of Americans' combat ability, and the result was that less than a quarter of them qualified, and most of them had no answer to the combat objective.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply hope that the Chinese people will not attach importance to the United States. The so-called American civilization and moral spirit cannot be compared with our East Asians. All our cooperation must be treated equally, but the United States does not treat the people of East Asia equally at all. In order to change the Americans' bad views, we can only educate them with this war. I also hope that you will cooperate in the war, change your views on Americans, and promote the completion of the Greater East Asia War.
