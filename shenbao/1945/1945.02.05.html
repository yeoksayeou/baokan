<h3>呂宋敵南下部隊現陷於孤立狀態那斯布克登陸敵軍遭痛擊</h3>
<p>呂宋島前綫日軍某基地四日中央社電呂宋島南下之敵軍，惟恐班加新安平原之日軍自側面攻擊，刻仍干羅沙留方面繼續進攻日軍陣地。卅一日敵軍曾企圖侵入呂宋東北地方高地，經日軍擊退。一日敵軍復於猛烈之砲擊掩護下，以的二連之兵力再度來犯，日軍對此特於二日出以夜襲，使敵軍陷於大混亂，使其通退。又烏明岡方面敵軍約一營，擁有戰車五輛及火砲多門，三十·三十一兩日更增强該地西北方構築陣地之兵力，亦經日軍肉搏突擊隊攻擊粉碎。至卅一日判明之戰果，計毀壞十五生的榴彈砲一·自動砲一·迫砲三·牽引車二·載重汽車二·鹵獲車載重機一·重機槍一·輕機槍一·自動步槍二六，幷使燃燒彈藥倉庫多處起火。莫尼的斯方面日軍挺進突擊一隊，一日仍繼續攻擊敵軍，一方克拉克菲爾德機塲周邊日軍仍堅據陣地，威脅敵軍南下，到處展開壯烈之砲戰及白刃戰。因之侵入聖菲爾南部之一部敵軍，自仁牙因灣橋頭堡之補給極感困難，以故南下部隊已陷於孤立狀態。斯比克灣及那斯布克登陸加强進攻，在那斯布克登陸之敵軍先頭部隊，一日企圖突入那斯布克東方，當地日軍即奮起應戰予以痛創，刻猶在激戰中。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　海通社海軍訪員沙爾華契特著稱：反軸心軍現在菲律賓登陸作戰中，除美國國艦隊外，有英法義軍艦參加作戰，足證美國未能單獨對付日本艦隊。</p>
<p>敵軍使用慣技驅菲人充砲炭</p>
<p>呂宋前綫四日中央社電　敵自於仁牙因灣登陸以來，到處盲炸醫院學校寺院，其殘虐不法行爲愈形露骨。據日軍肉搏突擊隊報告：敵軍將相當多之原住民軍，調至日軍攻擊之正面使作犧牲，侵入克拉克附近之一部敵軍先頭部隊，即亦混有原住民軍甚多。彼等原住民軍，常在前方作無可如何之作戰，且此等無事原住民均無正規之裝備，其中甚至有持木槍而作戰者。三年前，菲日軍開始菲律賓决定作戰時，卑怯之美軍令原住民軍當日軍之砲口，已則退守第二綫，享受安樂生活，最後更捨棄原住民逃往本國，此乃人所周知之事實。此次仁牙因登一陸作戰，彼等又使用其慣技，或以欺騙或以恐嚇，使洛勒爾總統領導之下忠誠原住民背叛祖國，犧牲於日軍砲火之下。</p>
<h3>敵機襲神戶戰果調查中</h3>

<h3>日軍攻陷始興抵南雄郊外</h3>
<p>粵漢前綫四日中央社電　攻陷遂川後南下之日軍，冒雨行進，刻其先進部隊，已進抵贛州附近，至使贛州防衛漸形動搖，同時與此相呼應，自韶關進擊之部隊，則於二日傍晚攻陷始興，繼之進迫南雄，其中一部已抵南雄郊外，南雄之佔領，已僅成時間問題。</p>
<h3>日駐澳門領事被狙擊受傷</h3>
<p>廣州四日中央社電　日駐澳門領事福井保光及該館書記朝此奈泰暉兩氏，二日下午八時五十分，于該領事館附近路行中，突遭兇徒狙擊，福井受傷頗重，朝比奈書記輕傷，事後廣州日大使館事務所即拍發電報，立派戶根木領事，赴當地調查，現悉此事乃敵方份子爲離間日葡兩國關係而出此者。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>工商界的自肅</h3>
<p>本月二日社評，提出强化同業公會問題。我們認爲强化同業公會，對於抑平物價與防止囤積都有極大效果，更有裨於戰時經濟與統制經濟。强化同業公會，是促成工商界團結，由於集體的力量，以謀本身利益的正常發展，並對於整個經濟趨於正軌盡其個別責任。</p>
<p>不過，强化同業公會，必先從工商界個別自肅做起。工商同業公會的每個會員，都有了健全的人格，都有了公私兼顧的商業道德，集合道樣的多數會員而成的公會，才能够强化。尤其是工商界的領袖，居於領導地位，更應以身作則，爲羣表率。如果同業公會的會員，都是只圖私利不顧公益，或者幾個同業領袖只圖追求暴利，那末，這個公會很可能成爲替會員張目的罪惡集團。我們對於以往一部分工商界的內幕，同業公會的實况，試加坦白的檢討，究竟是有利還是有害於整個經濟，不能不引爲極大疑問。</p>
<p>自從周市長蒞任以後，首先以抑平物價安定民生爲施政目標，凡是刺激物價波動，促使民生不安的種種事態，都須一一整頓，兩旬以來，風氣一變。我們認爲這是上海市政轉折的關鍵，也是是非淸算的階段，換句話說，就是官民自肅的一個機會。就工商界人士而言，過去的追求暴利，不顧公益的手段，今後絕對不容許繼續施虐，現在就是自肅矯正的機會，如果依然暴行，錯過自肅機會，那末淸算之日决不寬貸，與其毀名敗譽，不如從此自肅。</p>
<p>工商界人士，尤其是各業的一部分領袖，所應自肅的，最主要者是不追求暴利。工商業誠是以營利爲目的，不過所謂營利是指合理的利潤而言，暴利者决不是合理利潤。其决，下列兩事，也須自肅嬌正：</p>
<p>（一）過去各業要求漲價，輒向主管當局疏通，並以授賄方式取得允許。而工商界人以行賄所支，决不徒然賠累，俗語云：「羊毛出在羊身上」，結果完全轉嫁於一般顧客。這在官廳方面當然也是腐敗現象，不過工商界爲私利而投其所好，打開行賄之門，在刑律上的犯罪是相等的。今後工商界應即自好，不再以行賄爲便利私圖的工具，如果有請求漲價的理由與必要，儘可依照合法手續提出，如主管官廳故意留難，亦可依法呈訴。</p>
<p>（二）逃避納稅義務，在工商界中也是常有的現象。現在市財政當局已經屢次表示整頓稅收，工商界應納捐稅，自應忠實解繳。過去對於消費特稅一項，很多小規模商店向顧客照收，而並不轉繳，無異消費特稅之設，爲若輩闢一橫財之道。其時在徵稅機構方面也因舞弊百出，交相作弊。現在當局决心整飭，希望工商界也須自肅，應納捐稅，絕不逃避。</p>
<h3>四省邊區編成綏靖軍</h3>

<h3>實業協會呈請舉辦工業貸款</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　中國實業協會以邇來市面金融時有變動，各工廠籌碼，俱見緊縮，爲防止各工廠因此遭受損害影響生產，特呈請實業部轉咨財政部准予撥款五萬萬元舉辦工業貸款，實部對此正縝密研究中。</p>
<h3>首都學生生活營舉行結營式　新運會陳委長頒賜訓詞</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　中國靑年模範團幹運實踐會主辦之二屆學生寒假生活營，於四日下午二時舉行結營式，到長官有新運會許副秘書長等及全體營員共百餘人。行禮如儀，領袖訓話，由陳委負畏頒賜訓詞，特派新運會許副秘書長恭代宣讀，全體營員恭聆後，異常感奮，至四時許始畢。繼由許副秘書長率領營員赴陳委員長官邸致敬，由陳委員長親賜接見，由營員代表恭上致敬詞，繼由陳委員長致訓，並指示今後工作方針，對營員之精神頗爲嘉許，六時始退出官邸回營。茲錄陳委員長訓詞如後</p>
<p>訓詞原文</p>
<p>各位首都青年麻痹嚴寒天氣下，刻苦耐勞，完成三個星期的生活訓練，精神至堪敬佩，各位到生活營來，都是自動要求參加參加以後，本着靑年領導靑年的精神，營內一切由自己管理，自已訓練，同時又各盡所能，團結互助，相信各位在這一個星期所得到的，比較在原來學校三個月甚至三年的訓練，效果還大。</p>
<p>爲甚麼各位願意接受這種訓練？因爲各位需要接受這種訓練，自從領袖逝世以後，世界戰局一天比一天嚴重，大東亞戰事已到決戰的階段，中國的國民，中國國民中堅層的靑年們，都要把力量供獻出來，集中起來，才能挽救垂危的祖國，保衛解放戰爭中的東亞，一般靑年能體諒興華保亞意義的重大，所以需要多多鍛鍊自已，充實自己，所以大家朝氣勃勃的接受訓練，爭先恐後的接受訓練，</p>
<p>中國的前途是樂觀的，東亞的前途是光明的，因爲中國靑年的精神依舊蓬蓬勃勃，各位就是首都靑年的代表，就是中國靑年的代表，不怕風霜雨雪，勇猛精進，愈鍛鍊意念愈強，愈鍛鍊力量愈大。</p>
<p>生活營提出幹學運動是很有意義的，中國一般人的毛病，就是馬虎敷衍，尚空談不肯切切實實的幹，各位三個星期苦幹實幹生活的訓練，希望離營以後，永遠保持這種幹的精神，而且把幹的精神傳播給每一個中國靑年，每一個中國國民，大家都能够本着領袖遺訓，埋頭實幹，展拓新運，完遂戰爭，建設中國靑年的靑年中國，東亞靑年的靑年東亞！</p>

<h3>西綫德軍大砲發揮威力</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據美聯社訊：德軍最近曾於美第三軍後方基地，施以長距離之砲擊，關於此擾亂砲火之威力，司令部當局未有發表。砲火與數週前攻擊美第一軍及第九軍陣地者大致相同，其威力相等於八吋砲彈。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　西綫反軸心軍，頃除將因倫台特攻勢而敗退之凹部地區完全攻復外，更開始侵入齊格斐防綫。現在德軍于西部要塞最前進地帶爲門下窪東方至佛里挨木約四十公里之戰綫，刻反軸心軍正對該綫德軍最强骷休來狄加以拚命攻擊，並已迫至該市西方八公里地點。同時，聖維特東方，越烏爾河侵入德領之美第三軍，亦正將希尼伊斐爾地方德軍據守之六百米高地堅陣努力攻擊中</p>

<p>美機十架轟炸柏林</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　反軸心空軍爲呼應東綫蘇軍猛烈進攻，乃大舉擾亂德軍後方，並妨害德軍兵員器材向東綫增援運輸。據巴黎來電稱，三日美空軍之空中要塞大編隊的一千架，於九百餘架戰鬥機之護衛下，大舉轟炸柏林軍事及交通設施，按此次大規模日間轟炸，爲近所未有，投彈量達二千五百噸。</p>

<h3>至揚州訪孫良誠</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　澹明</p>
<p>停留了一天，從老百姓口中知道當地有兩個無法無天的所在，一個是火車站，一個是江邊碼頭。因此記者特地懇請縣府派了一名警士，伴同過江。跑到江邊碼頭，果見有幾個封管所職員在向旅客收錢，記者因有警士護送，得未留難。</p>
<p>鎮揚途中</p>
<p>從鎭江到揚州去的旅客，大都光渡江至六圩，然後再搭長途汽車或搭客汽車到城外，然而也有人乘內河輪船直接去揚的。內河輪船從早上十時或十一時開出，因拖船在十艘以外之故，須到上燈時分才可以駛抵揚州，所以要不是雨雪天，旅客是樂意坐汽車的，雖然搭客汽車索價奇昂，長送汽車不容易買票而又易於拋錨。自鎭江江邊到六圩去的渡輪，行程只有半小時，且歸中華輪船公司管轄，但船資却也貴得可以，每人須三百元。記者因有警士伴送，才受着半價（實際是二百元）的待遇，然而一般旅客據說也還不易買票哩！船從十點半開行，十一時抵達六圩。因爲前天又曾下雪之故，長途汽車還拋錨在途中，今天沒有開駛，一般旅客就不得不爭先坐搭客的小汽車了。可是小汽車索價之昂，實出意外，因爲雖然僅有三刻鐘的旅程，車夫竟討價每人五千元，最後始以三千元成交。一車坐的人，起碼有八九人，因此車頭上也坐一二人，眞是汽車搭客的創見。揚州四郊的田野風景，從車窗中一一映入眼廉，我想假定在暮春三月的艷陽天氣，一定綠柳成蔭，大有江南意味吧。</p>
<p>快到十二時的時候，汽車便在揚州城外長途汽車站停下，旅客一一走下，經過了浮橋（用船做成的），從運河上跨過，才得走進城去。記者馬上搭軍到蘇北綏靖主任公署，去訪問第二方面軍總司令兼蘇北綏靖主任孫良誠氏。</p>
<p>剿共情形</p>
<p>請到孫氏，還是那麼簡單和樸素，他住的房子也很簡陋，我想當今負軍政重任的要人，能如此生活簡樸的除孫氏外恐怕很少吧。西北軍的優良傳統，能够在我們和平建國的陣容中繼續生長下去，實在是蘇北，甚至全國之福！孫氏當即邀我一同午飯，飯後便和他談話，因爲他明天就要到恭州去，只得這樣快幹了</p>
<p>「澹明先生初來蘇北，恐怕對於蘇北的情形還不十分明瞭，讓我來說個大概吧！」他首先開口。接着又說：「蘇北，是一向被新四軍及八路軍目爲發展根據地的，所以蘇北的政治愈壞，甚至蘇北的駐在國軍愈缺少紀律，他們便愈成功。蘇北形成今日那種田地，過去在蘇北的軍政界應當負一部份責任。」</p>
<p>「共產黨在堅壁淸野的口號下，不僅把一切民房拆毀，且連一切人民和財物都囊括以去。人民在他們統治之下，只有所謂順我者生，逆我者亡的兩條路，什麼也不容你有說話的餘地。如果老百姓萬一有怨言，他們就活活處死，在處死時還給大家看看做個榜樣。你想，在這種壓迫老百姓的狀態下，還有什麼民主可言？</p>
<p>「否則，蘇北的人民也不會歡迎我們來了，當我們軍行所至，各地人民都點了香燭來歡迎我們。</p>
<p>「試想，在過去匪軍巢穴鹽城阜寗與東台一帶，城市莫不十室九空，連拆毀房屋的磚瓦也莫不一一碾成細塊，以免人民在他們過境後再來居住，此種用心，豈爲天地所容？」</p>
<p>「那末，國軍不是也有部隊駐在嗎？」記者反問：</p>
<p>「蘇北人民的苦痛，就是爲了這個原因，」孫氏坦白地說：「國家的軍隊如果沒有紀律，不如沒有的好。過去有些不長進的軍隊，在那裏以「帮票」來做發財的捷徑，你想蘇北人民如何能求這種軍隊保護呢？」</p>
<p>「這不是我虛說，」孫氏補一句：「當我們自河南開入蘇北時，沿途收到人民對當地駐軍的吿發狀眞是不知多少，且在各地歡迎會塲中還親自見到穿着和當地駐軍同樣制服的肉票，你想奇怪不奇怪</p>
<p>「那末，」記者變了話題：「總司令一路率領大軍南下時，不知道曾與新四軍作過戰鬥嗎？」</p>
<p>「有的，」他說：「一次在灌雲附近，最初聽說對方有一百個團，後來實際參加堵截我們的，也有幾十個團，可是都給我們戰敗了。當我們行近濯雲的時候，就獲得情報說，他們準備沿途截擊我們，因爲他們認爲我軍調防蘇北是他們的心腹大患，所以不惜以全力來堵截。來勢固然很猛，然而我認爲他們來得正好，軍隊本是爲國家除暴安良的，所以我們無不以一敵百。譬如還有一次在阜寗附近，展開了更大的戰鬥，結果他們從不曾在戰塲上拋棄過武器的，那一回也丟了二三百技槍械。」</p>
<p>「新四軍的槍械也好嗎？」記者禁不住問他：</p>
<p>「有時很好，」孫氏答道：「那一次鹵獲的便長他們從渝軍那裏奪來的軍器。」</p>
<p>「現在蘇北的新四軍活躍得如何？」我問：</p>
<p>「當然還是遍地皆是」，孫氏回答：「但我已下了决心要保障地方，準備以全力來對付他們。聽說，上次和我們在阜寗作戰的匪軍，今已有渡江南下的模樣。所以蘇北對於京滬沿途的屏障價值是很重大的。」</p>
<p>「不曉得總司令將如何整理蘇北呢？」記者問：</p>
<p>革新軍政</p>
<p>「過去蘇北的壞，」孫氏立加答語：「第一在遍地是共黨軍隊，第二在政治的腐敗，第三在駐軍的擾民。現在我們如果要勦共，單靠軍事的力量是不夠的，所以必須得先自整飭地方政治，淘汰不良駐軍開始。」</p>
<p>「將如何改良蘇北的軍政呢？」記者急於追問：</p>
<p>「我向來不主張殺人的，」孫氏笑着說：「可是在這亂世果眞能殺一儆百也是應取的辦法。所以我準備對軍政各方提高其待遇，然後召開軍政聯席會議，請各方和我訂立的章，誓不再行爲非作弊，苟有不檢，則我決遵約嚴辦，甚至槍斃。」</p>
<p>「現在主張用重刑的人很多，」孫氏補入一句：「但是我決先顧到一般中下級軍政人員生活的淸苦，替他們解決一切困難之後，然後再執行重刑。</p>
<p>「照你說法，」我還問：「在革新蘇北軍政之先，必得有一筆大經費，不知將從何取得？」</p>
<p>「蘇北是很富的，」孫氏說：「過去他們都不過入了少數人的私囊罷了。我們如果能把這些本入私人腰包中的錢來分攤給忠心服務的人員是儘够的。」</p>
<p>「不曉得總司令將如何鍛練你的幹部？」</p>
<p>「我的幹部便是第二方面軍，」他說：「我曾和他們說，你們好比像一個貞潔的處女，可是現在到了這個惡習甚深的蘇北，眞如初涉足於萬惡社會，四面有猙獰面目的妖魔在引誘你們作惡，所以你們非嚴防不可。現在他們到這裏已有幾個月了，可是說不句客氣的話，他們倒還各守我的訓言。</p>
<p>揚州一瞥</p>
<p>記者和孫氏談了的有一個多鐘頭話，因爲外面已等候着許多要見孫氏的軍政要人，我便起立吿辭。孫氏送到門外，才握手而別。於是劉宣傳主任招待我住於綠楊旅社，這個旅社名字倒很好聽，其實也是有名無實。然而，即使這樣，已是揚州首屈一指的旅店了。後來我們還不顧泥濘的道路，到街頭去觀光，大概頂熟鬧的是敎堂街興勝街蘇唱街左右街一帶，著名的住宅都是磚街一帶。可是江都縣城，並不像京滬一帶的城市，在過去一二十年間逐步染着近代的色彩，它還是保持着中古時代的情調，不僅街道狹小，道路用石條舖成的已算頂好了。揚州的享受是出名的；像揚州浴室的洗澡，四五六的小吃，富春的點心都是和以前一樣算是這裘的特巴。至於旅舍，除了綠楊旅社外，還有一處叫做揚舍公寓的，比較潔凈，且附有中西菜社，所以一個旅客如果能住到那裏，就比較舒適，可惜房子不多，不易借到罷了。</p>

<h3>北站秩序漸見良好</h3>
<p>本市警察局鑒於北火車站，爲本市唯一交通大站，每日往來旅客，不下萬千，過去因黑帽于等車站員役敲詐勒索，擾害旅客，非筆墨所能形容，茲爲澈底整頓交通維諉旅客安全計，決定着手整理，特於交通路設立北站分局，挑選優良警員負責北站秩序。該局成立以來，嚴密執行勤務，記者爲明瞭該區現狀起見，特親往北站巡視。（一）感覺交通方面。過去站前任意停放車輛之紊亂狀態，今已漸見改觀。（二）站內入口，本規定頭二等由大門出入，過去負責警備人員，任意放縱出入，不加阻止，今則按照規章，引導旅客，循序入站。（三）站內秩序因維持得當，更時有便衣警員偵查不良份子行動，旅客依次排列上車，秩序井然。（四）過去號稱黑地之賣票處，情形較前整齊，賣票間亦經華中鐵通公司當局一再整頓，已不似先前態度，有票購票，逾額停售。是以旅客購票，手續簡便，毋須求諸黑市。（五）過去站前攤販雜陳，人聲囂雜，情形紊亂不堪，今已全部改善，商旅稱便，聞華鐵當局對整頓北站秩序，決心協助市府作更進一步之改善。</p>

<h3>三十四年度各地農業增產要點（三）</h3>
<p>（一）油榮之增植則應於油榮主要生產地區，利用合作社，試作晨報，特約農報等，以爲示範及採種之中心，一面使附近農民得實地之觀摹，又應配給優良種子，以爲季休閑地利用之推進，俾達期小麥，油榮之增產。（二）甘薯生長之主要鄉鎭，應使試作農報及特約農報爲栽培模範，並督率互助及協進會，獎勵改良其育苗及栽植之方法。又收穫時，應舉行產量競賽會，以爲耕種改良之獎勵，此項工作，本年每鄉鎭計劃補助費三萬元。（三）農具部方面：令行合作社，支社，分社，互助社，及其他關係團體，購置脫榖機，俾改善脫榖方法，且節省勞力。一面更使農民養成合作精神及習慣，爲合作增產之基礎，凡購債此項機器者，每部計劃補助費五千元，爲補救包紮材料之缺乏，本年度應積極從事事工獎品之生產，凡購置　工品製造機構者，計劃予以購置費半額之補助費，惟每部最多以補助一千二百元爲限。（四）耕牛部方面，農業生產力之保持，及擴張耕牛，實居最重要之地位，着在增加生產，從事深耕時，耕牛更屬必要，故耕牛之碗保及繁殖，意義實爲重大。本年度定於農民購買耕牛，及飼養者，應蓋最大努力，予以協助及保護。（五）種畜部曁牲畜之改良繁殖，應自牲畜始，故種畜之設置，應以全力辦理之，本年度對設置抓牛者，預定每頭予以補助費十四萬元，設置種隊一者，預定每頭予以補助費六萬元，又家畜防疫亦爲率產上必要設施，上年度，實業部血淸製造所尚來成立，一般血清及預防液無後購置，故此項專業未能舉辦，現該所舉籌辦有日，成立在即，預計本年度內關於家畜防疫事宜，定即分別着手實施。</p>
<p>（丙）關於工藝作物增產者，棉花之試騐研究以及採種：本年度完全由中央農業賓騐所負責辦理，俾便集中力量，且使該所嗣後成爲棉作技術改進之核心，（一）關於棉作一般增產方面：如生產收買，及配給統制等，上年度由各關係機關協力統一化以來，蘇，浙，皖，三省，及京，滬兩市會收　期的成效。故本年度仍本以前方針繼續進行，（二）蔴作，蔴類爲一般工業所必需，本年度計劃於特定麻作推廣團體工作區域之外，再從新增植麻作二萬畝，俾便一般農民均知從事植麻。（三）菎麻，上年度菎麻之增產，因得各方協力之結果，已超出預期之成果。</p>
<p>（丁）本年度增產計劃，俟與各關係方面商洽妥善後，再行與獎勵及補助辦法，同時公布。關於農業技術員養成者：（一）農業指導人員二根據去年增產工作推動之經騐，凡從事農業增產工作直接指導農民生產之技術指導人員，實不可缺，故本年度預定於中央農業實騐所內集中訓練農業指導員一百名，俾資應用而利進行。（二）農業技術人員：上年度合作社曾訓練農業技術人員二百名，但不敷分配，故本年度應以已受訓練之中堅農民中，選拔優秀有爲者一百名，施以三個月之再訓練，一俟訓練完畢，即分發各地合作社服務，傳供指導各該地農民之用。</p>
<p>（戊）關於農村副業振興者：（一）農村副業之謂習：上年度增產工作大都注重於農業生產技術之改善，農業經濟方面，則因時間及其他種種關係未及辦理，但農業經濟未能復興，則農業技術勢亦難期改進，因而農業增產自亦不能完全達到目的，故太年度除集中力量於指定地區內辦理農業技術之改良指導獎勵外，對於農林經濟問題，應特別注重農村副業與農民經濟會有密切關係者也。緣是農村副業之講習，應即加緊舉辦之。（二）農村副業工塲之補助：農村副業之重要，已如前條所述，此項工作塲，自應特予倡導，本年度預定補助二十處，預定補助三萬元。（三）農產品加工塲之籌設：際此農村需用物資缺乏，農業經濟疲敝時期，農產品加工製造，實佔經濟上重要地位，因此本年度對於此項加工塲應積極籌設，幷預定儘先成立八處，每處補助二百萬元。（完）</p>
<h3>本市上週間金融工商市況　黃金公債變動劇烈</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週變化繼續演進，惟大部份原因，仍係受歐局空氣之流言，人心購買黃金突熾，以及對公債吸意漸濃，故除黃金與公債波動較烈之外，其他華股及食用品情况，雖起伏參差不一，但整個金融工商業，實際均甚穩靜如恒。一旦投機風氣消戢，市况可望依然恢復平定，所以當局現正嚴密偵緝投機市儈之非法活動，處以嚴峻措置，以期消滅操縱擾亂市面弊害。綜觀上週內之烚赤，漲跌範圍之大，爲從來所未見，一日之間漲勢最鉅者達三十關左右，最高峯曾達一百四十三關，其時吸購者幷不示弱，旋經當局洞察其底蘊，拘詢不法操縱市儈後，漲勢隨即平復而劇降。惟各種統債挺勢仍堅，華股週三至週五僅熱門股劇漲，交易旺盛，週六則因電力加緊限制，人心見疲，股市反漲爲跌，走勢萎靡不振。錢業拆息掛牌仍站六角五分原盤，暗息則以舊歷總結束關係，需款殷切，同業拆借，暗息繼見提高。市面碼籌，經中儲增發新鈔後，短少情形已稍平復。至於工商各業，工廠業因電力供給問題，尚未解决，致生產一時不易恢復，營業難見起色，各業商是以進貨未能暢旺，門市售價漲勢，難以抑止，兼因舊歷年關，居民紛紛添購貨物，把持市價，民生日食用品中之米雜糧及油糖蔬菜，均稍提高，尤以米價漲起較厲。</p>
<h3>市工務局開局務會議</h3>
<p>市工務局自去年八月一日奉令合併前第一區公署工務處以來，經銳意整頓，各種計劃均按步實施，但因前第一區公署工務處，係由前工部局工務處及前法公董局工務處合併組織成立，人事方面較爲複雜，本定今年正月間將人事予以調整，嗣因事延期，茲悉張局長恩麟爲積極推進各種工作，於前（三）日在該局秘書室召開局務議會，該局主任以上人員均出席，首由主任秘書張閎中，闡明會議目的，令各科室將應興應廢各項工作計劃，即日詳細塡報，以便統盤籌劃，使工作得以簡捷迅速進行。</p>

<p>籃球聯賽，原定昨晚舉行之甲甲組第一循環决賽華聯對中北，因陸軍宿舍球房之觀衆，過於擁擠，塲地被佔，球塲縮小至不合比賽之程度，上海籃球聯合會事先决定此賽不作正式比賽，改爲友誼表演賽，結果中北以四十六比三十九勝華聯，上半時三十一比二十一分。西靑球房秩序之維持，殊值得籃球會當局之研究注意，昨晚竟有觀衆因過擠而昏迷者。汕隊勝V隊，上半時V隊十六比十四領先，結果各二十五，延長五分鐘，汕隊以一分戰勝，二十八比二十七。女子組益康勝雪白，競爭劇烈，二十一比十三，，上半時各得八分。</p>

<h3>The Enemy Forces Advancing South in Luzon Are Now in an Isolated State; Enemy Troops Landing at Nasugbu Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, Japanese Base, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy forces advancing south in Luzon, fearing a flanking attack by Japanese forces in the Bangasinan Plain, are continuing their offensive against Japanese positions in the Canossa and Rosary areas. On the 31st, enemy forces attempted to invade the highlands of northeastern Luzon but were repulsed by Japanese forces. On the 1st, under heavy artillery cover, the enemy attacked again with two companies. The Japanese responded with a night attack on the 2nd, throwing the enemy into chaos and forcing them to retreat. In the Umin-Gakon area, an enemy battalion with five tanks and multiple artillery pieces reinforced its defenses in the northwest on the 30th and 31st. These defenses were also destroyed by Japanese close-combat assault teams. The confirmed results of the battle by the 31st included the destruction of one 15-centimeter howitzer, one automatic cannon, three mortars, two towing vehicles, two trucks, and the capture of one truck-mounted machine gun, one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, and twenty-six automatic rifles. Several ammunition depots were also set ablaze. In the Monyos area, a Japanese advancing assault team continued to attack enemy forces on the 1st. Meanwhile, Japanese forces around Clark Field remained firmly entrenched, threatening the enemy's southward advance, engaging in fierce artillery and bayonet battles. As a result, a portion of the enemy forces that had penetrated southern San Fernando faced severe supply difficulties from the Lingayen Gulf bridgehead, leading to the isolation of the southward advancing troops. The landings at Subic Bay and Nasugbu were being reinforced, and the leading elements of the enemy forces that landed at Nasugbu attempted to break through east of Nasugbu on the 1st. Local Japanese forces fiercely resisted, inflicting heavy losses, and fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Hitherto, naval correspondent Saar-Vachert noted: In the ongoing landing operations in the Philippines, in addition to the US fleet, British, French, and Italian warships are participating, demonstrating that the United States cannot independently confront the Japanese fleet.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Use Their Usual Tactic of Driving Filipinos as Cannon Fodder</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since landing in Lingayen Gulf, the enemy has been indiscriminately bombing hospitals, schools, and temples everywhere, revealing increasingly blatant acts of brutality and illegality. According to reports from Japanese close-combat assault teams, the enemy is deploying a significant number of indigenous troops to the front lines of Japanese attacks, using them as sacrifices. Among the leading elements of enemy forces that have penetrated near Clark, there are also many indigenous troops. These indigenous troops are often forced to engage in hopeless battles at the forefront, and these unarmed indigenous people lack proper equipment, with some even fighting with wooden guns. Three years ago, when Japanese forces initiated decisive operations in the Philippines, the cowardly American forces ordered indigenous troops to face the Japanese guns, while they retreated to the second line to enjoy a comfortable life, ultimately abandoning the indigenous people and fleeing to their homeland. This is a well-known fact. This time, in the Lingayen Gulf landing operation, they are again using their usual tactics, deceiving or intimidating loyal indigenous people under the leadership of President Laurel into betraying their country and sacrificing themselves under Japanese fire.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Kobe; Battle Results Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 4th that on the afternoon of February 4th, one hundred enemy aircraft attacked from the Mariana Islands, focusing their main force on Kobe City and a portion on Mie Prefecture. There were some casualties on the Japanese side. The results of the battle are currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers Budget Committee's General Interrogation Concluded</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese House of Peers Budget Committee's comprehensive review of the general budget bill for the next fiscal year began on January 31st. Interrogation concluded on February 4th. From the 5th, it will be handed over to various subcommittees for detailed review. The final general meeting will be held on the 7th, and it is expected that the general budget bill will be resolved and passed, and it can be established in each meeting on the 8th or 9th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Holds a Speech Rally</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Philippine decisive battle assault speech rally, organized by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association's Asia General Headquarters, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall here at 1:00 PM on the 3rd. Attendees included various leaders of the headquarters, Lieutenant General Homma Masaharu, Philippine Ambassador to Japan Vargas, and representatives from Axis countries. The audience filled the hall. First, General Matsui, the director of the headquarters, delivered a speech, followed by passionate speeches by Mr. Hamada, a member of the Diet who had returned from the front lines, and Philippine Ambassador Vargas, moving the audience deeply.</p>
<h3>Battles Near Shwebo in Burma Intensify; Japanese Forces' Battle Results in January</h3>
<p>Northern Burma Front, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The fighting between the two sides centered on the plains of Shwebo (northwest of Mandalay) in the Irrawaddy River bend is gradually intensifying. Enemy forces are gradually advancing southward with the power of various heavy weapons, while local Japanese forces are ambushing them in various locations, engaging in fierce battles. Since late January, the battle situation has suddenly become urgent, and a decisive battle is imminent. In the fighting there during January, the damage inflicted on the enemy was as follows: 2,197 abandoned corpses, 28 tanks destroyed and burned, 42 armored vehicles destroyed, 1,740 various rifles, 24 light and heavy machine guns destroyed, 50 trucks, and a large amount of other ammunition, clothing, and provisions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Industry Suggests Organizing a Production Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry and executives from seven related organizations, in view of the current war situation and the urgent need to establish a production system consistent with the front lines, conducted a detailed review of specific implementation measures. As a result, they reached an agreement on the "Outline of Establishing a Production Army Posture." Mr. Kashiwara, Chairman of the Industrial Patriotic Society, Mr. Matsuno, Chairman of the Labor Patriotic Society, Mr. Sengoku, Advisor to the Central Industrial Association, and Mr. Funada, Chairman of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, met with Prime Minister Koiso at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, submitted the proposal, and hoped that the government would implement it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Capture Shihsing and Reach the Outskirts of Nanxiong</h3>
<p>Kwangtung-Hankow Front, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces advancing southward after capturing Suichuan proceeded in the rain. Their advanced units have now reached the vicinity of Kanchow, causing the defense of Kanchow to gradually falter. Simultaneously, in coordination with this, forces advancing from Shaokuan captured Shihsing on the evening of the 2nd, and then advanced towards Nanxiong. A portion of them has reached the outskirts of Nanxiong, and the occupation of Nanxiong is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Macau Shot and Wounded</h3>
<p>Canton, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Mr. Fukui Yasumitsu, the Japanese Consul in Macau, and Mr. Asahina Taiji, a secretary at the consulate, were shot by assassins at 8:50 PM on the 2nd while walking near the consulate. Fukui was seriously injured, and Secretary Asahina was slightly injured. Afterwards, the Japanese Embassy Office in Canton immediately sent a telegram dispatching Consul Toneki to investigate the incident locally. It is now understood that this was done by enemy elements to sow discord between Japan and Portugal.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Self-Restraint in the Business Community</h3>
<p>In the editorial on the 2nd of this month, the issue of strengthening trade associations was raised. We believe that strengthening trade associations will have a significant effect on suppressing prices and preventing hoarding, and will also be beneficial to the wartime economy and controlled economy. Strengthening trade associations is to promote the unity of the business community, using collective strength to seek the normal development of their own interests, and to fulfill their individual responsibilities to bring the entire economy into order.</p>
<p>However, strengthening trade associations must start with individual self-restraint in the business community. Every member of a trade association must have a sound personality and a sense of commercial ethics that takes into account both public and private interests. Only then can a trade association formed by a collection of such members be strengthened. In particular, leaders in the business community, who are in a leading position, should set an example for the group. If the members of a trade association are only concerned with their own interests and disregard public interests, or if a few business leaders only seek to pursue exorbitant profits, then the association may very well become a criminal group that defends the interests of its members. We must frankly review the past inside stories of some business circles and the actual situation of trade associations. Whether it is beneficial or harmful to the entire economy cannot but be regarded as a very big question.</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou took office, he has first taken suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood as the goal of his administration. All kinds of incidents that stimulate price fluctuations and cause unrest to people's livelihood must be rectified one by one. In the past two weeks, the atmosphere has changed. We believe that this is the turning point of Shanghai's municipal administration, and it is also the stage of sorting out right and wrong. In other words, it is an opportunity for self-restraint of officials and the people. As far as the business community is concerned, the past pursuit of exorbitant profits and disregard of public interests will absolutely not be allowed to continue to inflict abuse in the future. Now is the opportunity for self-restraint and correction. If the abuse continues and the opportunity for self-restraint is missed, then the day of reckoning will never be lenient. Rather than ruining your reputation, it is better to exercise self-restraint from now on.</p>
<p>What business people, especially some leaders in various industries, should restrain themselves from most importantly is not pursuing exorbitant profits. Industry and commerce are indeed for the purpose of profit, but the so-called profit refers to reasonable profit, and exorbitant profit is definitely not reasonable profit. Furthermore, the following two matters must also be corrected with self-restraint:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, various industries often lobbied the competent authorities to request price increases, and obtained permission by means of bribery. However, the expenses paid by business people for bribery will never be a total loss. As the saying goes, "The wool comes from the sheep." As a result, it is completely passed on to ordinary customers. This is of course also a phenomenon of corruption in government agencies, but the business community opens the door to bribery for private interests by catering to its preferences. The crime under the criminal law is equal. In the future, the business community should immediately be self-disciplined and no longer use bribery as a tool to facilitate private interests. If there are reasons and necessity for requesting price increases, they can be submitted in accordance with legal procedures. If the competent authorities deliberately make things difficult, they can also file a complaint according to the law.</p>
<p>(2) Evading tax obligations is also a common phenomenon in the business community. Now the municipal finance authorities have repeatedly expressed their intention to rectify tax collection. The donations and taxes payable by the business community should be truthfully paid. In the past, many small-scale stores charged customers for consumption special taxes but did not remit them, which was tantamount to opening up a way for these people to make a fortune. At that time, there were also many malpractices in the tax collection agencies, with collusion and fraud. Now that the authorities are determined to rectify the situation, it is hoped that the business community will also exercise self-restraint and never evade the donations and taxes that should be paid.</p>

<h3>Closing Ceremony of the Capital Students' Life Camp; Chairman Chen of the New Life Movement Association Bestows Instructions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The closing ceremony of the Second Winter Vacation Life Camp for Students, organized by the Chinese Youth Model Corps Work-and-Study Practice Association, was held at 2:00 PM on the 4th. Officials present included Vice Secretary-General Xu of the New Life Movement Association and more than 100 campers. After the ceremony, the leader gave instructions. Chairman Chen, because of pressing matters, sent Vice Secretary-General Xu of the New Life Movement Association to deliver the instructions on his behalf. All the campers listened respectfully and were very moved. The ceremony ended at around 4:00 PM. Afterwards, Vice Secretary-General Xu led the campers to Chairman Chen's official residence to pay their respects. Chairman Chen received them personally. The camp representatives respectfully presented a tribute, and Chairman Chen gave instructions and pointed out the direction of future work, commending the spirit of the campers. They left the official residence and returned to the camp at 6:00 PM. The instructions of Chairman Chen are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Original Text of the Instructions</p>
<p>Fellow youths of the capital, enduring the severe cold, working hard and enduring hardship, completing three weeks of life training, your spirit is extremely admirable. You all came to the life camp voluntarily. After participating, based on the spirit of youth leading youth, everything in the camp is managed and trained by yourselves. At the same time, you all do your best, unite and help each other. I believe that what you have gained in this week is greater than the effect of training in the original school for three months or even three years.</p>
<p>Why are you willing to accept this kind of training? Because you need to accept this kind of training. Since the death of the leader, the world war situation has become more and more serious. The Greater East Asia War has reached the stage of decisive battle. The people of China, the youths who are the backbone of the Chinese people, must contribute and concentrate their strength in order to save the dying motherland and defend East Asia in the war of liberation. The general youth can understand the great significance of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, so they need to train themselves more and enrich themselves, so everyone is vigorously accepting training, rushing to accept training.</p>
<p>The future of China is optimistic, and the future of East Asia is bright, because the spirit of Chinese youth is still vigorous. You are the representatives of the youths of the capital, and you are the representatives of the youths of China. Not afraid of wind, frost, rain, and snow, bravely forging ahead, the more training, the stronger the will, the more training, the greater the strength.</p>
<p>The life camp's proposal of the work-study movement is very meaningful. The general problem of the Chinese people is that they are sloppy and perfunctory, advocating empty talk and unwilling to do things practically. You have three weeks of hard work and practical life training. I hope that after leaving the camp, you will always maintain this spirit of hard work, and spread the spirit of hard work to every Chinese youth and every Chinese citizen. Everyone can follow the leader's instructions, bury themselves in practical work, develop new movements, complete the war, and build a young China for Chinese youths and a young East Asia for East Asian youths!</p>

<h3>German Artillery on the Western Front Displays Its Power</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to the Associated Press: German forces recently carried out long-range shelling of the rear base of the U.S. Third Army. The headquarters authorities have not released any information on the power of this disruptive artillery fire. The artillery fire is roughly the same as that which attacked the positions of the U.S. First and Ninth Armies several weeks ago, and its power is equivalent to an 8-inch shell.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Allied forces on the Western Front have not only completely recovered the bulge area that retreated due to the Lunstedt offensive, but have also begun to invade the Siegfried Line. Currently, the German army's most advanced line of defense in the western fortress extends from east of Montabaur to Vriezenheim, a distance of approximately 40 kilometers. The Allied forces are desperately attacking the strongest Schulleidich area of the German army on this line, and have already pushed to a point 8 kilometers west of the city. At the same time, east of St. Vith, the U.S. Third Army, which has invaded German territory across the Ur River, is also making efforts to attack the 600-meter-high fortified position held by the German army in the Schnee Eifel area.</p>
<h3>Decisive Battle Unfolds at the Warta River Pocket; German and Soviet Forces Actively Reinforcing</h3>

The shells of the Soviet artillery units in the area between Frankfurt and Küstrin are falling on both banks of the Warta River. At present, the Soviet army is regrouping its forces for a major breakthrough operation on the Warta River. The German army is also deploying very powerful reserves and will engage in a decisive battle in front of the Warta River. Moscow intelligence also stated that the German forces on both sides of Frankfurt have been significantly strengthened, and the newly added German forces include security police units. The Warta River offensive and defensive battle that will determine the fate of Berlin has begun.</p>
<p>Ten American Planes Bomb Berlin</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to respond to the fierce offensive of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, the Allied air force launched a large-scale disruption of the German rear and hindered the German army's reinforcement transport of personnel and equipment to the Eastern Front. According to dispatches from Paris, on the 3rd, a large formation of 1,000 American air force "Flying Fortresses," escorted by more than 900 fighter planes, launched a large-scale bombing of Berlin's military and transportation facilities. According to reports, this large-scale daytime bombing is unprecedented, with a bomb load of 2,500 tons.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Visiting Sun Liangcheng in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Danming</p>
<p>After staying for a day, I learned from the locals that there were two lawless places: the train station and the riverside dock. Therefore, I specifically requested the county government to send a policeman to accompany me across the river. I went to the riverside dock and indeed saw several officials from the sealed-off management office collecting money from passengers. Because I had a policeman escorting me, I was not bothered.</p>
<p>Journey Between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou</p>
<p>Travelers going from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou mostly cross the river to Liuwei, and then take a long-distance bus or passenger car to the outskirts of the city. However, some people take inland river steamers directly to Yangzhou. The inland river steamers depart from 10:00 or 11:00 AM. Because the tugboat tows more than ten barges, it takes until the evening to arrive in Yangzhou. So, unless it's raining or snowing, travelers prefer to take the bus, even though passenger cars charge exorbitant prices, and long-distance buses are difficult to buy tickets for and prone to breakdowns. The ferry from the riverside in Zhenjiang to Liuwei takes only half an hour and is under the jurisdiction of the China Steamship Company, but the fare is also quite expensive, requiring 300 yuan per person. Because I had a policeman accompanying me, I received half-price treatment (actually 200 yuan). However, it is said that it is still not easy for ordinary passengers to buy tickets! The ship departed at 10:30 AM and arrived in Liuwei at 11:00 AM. Because it had snowed again the day before, the long-distance bus was still broken down on the way and did not run today. Ordinary passengers had to scramble to take passenger cars. However, the price of passenger cars was unexpectedly high. Although the journey was only three-quarters of an hour, the drivers asked for 5,000 yuan per person, and finally settled for 3,000 yuan. At least eight or nine people sit in one car, so one or two people sit on the hood as well, truly a novel idea for car passengers. The rural scenery of the suburbs of Yangzhou passed by the car window. I thought if it were a sunny day in March, the weeping willows would surely provide ample shade, with a strong Jiangnan flavor.</p>
<p>Around noon, the car stopped at the long-distance bus station outside Yangzhou. Passengers got off one by one, crossed the pontoon bridge (made of boats) over the Grand Canal, and then walked into the city. I immediately took a military vehicle to the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office to visit Mr. Sun Liangcheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army and Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The Situation of Communist Suppression</p>
<p>Mr. Sun was as simple and unadorned as ever. His house was also very simple. I think that among the important figures in the military and political affairs of today, there are probably very few who live as frugally as Mr. Sun. It is a blessing for Northern Jiangsu, and even the whole country, that the excellent traditions of the Northwest Army can continue to grow in our ranks of peaceful national construction! Mr. Sun immediately invited me to lunch, and we talked after the meal because he was leaving for Gongzhou tomorrow, so we had to be quick.</p>
<p>"Mr. Danming, you are new to Northern Jiangsu, I am afraid that you do not fully understand the situation in Northern Jiangsu, let me give you a general idea!" he began. He continued, "Northern Jiangsu has always been regarded by the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army as a base for development. Therefore, the worse the politics of Northern Jiangsu, and even the more undisciplined the National Army stationed in Northern Jiangsu, the more successful they will be. The military and political circles in Northern Jiangsu in the past should bear some responsibility for the situation in Northern Jiangsu today."</p>
<p>"Under the slogan of 'clearing the fields and strengthening the walls', the Communist Party not only demolished all the houses, but also encompassed all the people and property. Under their rule, the people only have two paths: 'those who obey me live, those who resist me die'. They do not allow you to say anything. If the people have any complaints, they will be executed alive, and they will be shown to everyone as an example. You think, in this state of oppressing the people, what democracy can be spoken of?"</p>
<p>"Otherwise, the people of Northern Jiangsu would not have welcomed us. When our army arrived, people everywhere lit incense to welcome us."</p>
<p>"Just imagine, in the past bandit dens of Yancheng, Funing, and Dongtai, most of the cities were empty, and even the bricks and tiles of the demolished houses were ground into fine pieces to prevent people from living there again after they passed through. How can this kind of intention be tolerated by heaven and earth?"</p>
<p>"Then, are there not also National Army troops stationed there?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu is for this reason," Mr. Sun frankly said, "A national army that has no discipline is worse than none. In the past, some unprogressive troops used 'protection tickets' as a shortcut to get rich. How can the people of Northern Jiangsu ask this kind of army to protect them?"</p>
<p>"This is not just what I say," Mr. Sun added, "When we entered Northern Jiangsu from Henan, we received so many accusations from the people against the local stationed troops along the way. And in the welcome meetings in various places, I personally saw people wearing the same uniforms as the local stationed troops who had been kidnapped. Don't you think that is strange?"</p>
<p>"Then," I changed the subject, "Did the Commander-in-Chief engage in any battles with the New Fourth Army along the way when he led the army south?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "Once near Guanyun, we initially heard that the other side had 100 regiments, but in reality, there were dozens of regiments participating in blocking us, but they were all defeated by us. When we approached Zhuoyun, we received intelligence that they were preparing to intercept us along the way, because they believed that our army's transfer to Northern Jiangsu was a serious threat to them, so they did not hesitate to use all their strength to block us. Although their momentum was very fierce, I thought they came at the right time. The army is for eliminating violence and pacifying the people for the country, so we all fought one against a hundred. For example, there was another time near Funing, where an even bigger battle broke out. As a result, they had never abandoned their weapons on the battlefield before, but this time they lost two or three hundred pieces of equipment."</p>
<p>"Are the weapons of the New Fourth Army good?" I couldn't help but ask him.</p>
<p>"Sometimes they are very good," Mr. Sun replied, "The ones we seized that time were the military equipment they had snatched from the Yu Army."</p>
<p>"How active is the New Fourth Army in Northern Jiangsu now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, they are still everywhere," Mr. Sun replied, "But I have made up my mind to protect the area and prepare to deal with them with all my strength. I heard that the bandits who fought with us in Funing last time are now trying to cross the river to the south. Therefore, Northern Jiangsu's value as a barrier along the Beijing-Shanghai line is very significant."</p>
<p>"I wonder how the Commander-in-Chief will reorganize Northern Jiangsu?" I asked.</p>
<p>Reforming Military and Political Affairs</p>
<p>"The reason why Northern Jiangsu was bad in the past," Mr. Sun immediately replied, "First, there were Communist troops everywhere; second, the politics were corrupt; and third, the stationed troops were disturbing the people. Now, if we want to suppress the Communists, we cannot rely solely on military force, so we must first rectify local politics and eliminate the bad stationed troops."</p>
<p>"How will you improve the military and political affairs of Northern Jiangsu?" I asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I have never advocated killing people," Mr. Sun said with a smile, "But in this chaotic world, if killing one can serve as a warning to a hundred, it is also an advisable method. Therefore, I plan to increase the treatment of all parties in the military and political fields, and then convene a joint military and political conference to ask all parties to sign the regulations I have made and swear not to act improperly or fraudulently again. If there is any misconduct, I will resolutely handle it strictly in accordance with the agreement, and even execute them."</p>
<p>"There are many people who advocate using severe penalties now," Mr. Sun added, "But I will first consider the poor lives of the general middle and lower-level military and political personnel, solve all their difficulties, and then implement severe penalties."</p>
<p>"According to you," I asked, "Before reforming the military and political affairs of Northern Jiangsu, you must have a large amount of funds. Where will you get them from?"</p>
<p>"Northern Jiangsu is very rich," Mr. Sun said, "In the past, they all went into the pockets of a few people. If we can distribute the money that went into private pockets to those who serve loyally, it will be more than enough."</p>
<p>"I wonder how the Commander-in-Chief will train your cadres?"</p>
<p>"My cadres are the Second Front Army," he said, "I told them that you are like a chaste virgin, but now you have come to this Northern Jiangsu, which is full of bad habits, just like setting foot in a world of evil for the first time. There are demons with hideous faces on all sides enticing you to do evil, so you must guard against them strictly. Now they have been here for several months, but to be frank, they have all kept my instructions."</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Yangzhou</p>
<p>I talked with Mr. Sun for more than an hour. Because there were many military and political figures waiting outside to see Mr. Sun, I stood up and said goodbye. Mr. Sun saw me off to the door before shaking hands and parting. Then, Director Liu of the Propaganda Department invited me to stay at the Green Willow Hotel. The name of this hotel sounds very nice, but it is actually only in name. However, even so, it is the leading hotel in Yangzhou. Later, we disregarded the muddy roads and went to the streets to sightsee. Probably the most bustling areas are around Church Street, Xingsheng Street, and Su Chang Street, and the famous residences are all in the Brick Street area. However, Jiangdu County is not like the cities in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which have gradually adopted modern colors in the past one or two decades. It still retains the atmosphere of the Middle Ages. Not only are the streets narrow, but the roads paved with stone strips are considered the best. Yangzhou's enjoyment is famous; like the Yangzhou bathhouses, the four, five, and six snacks, and the dim sum of Fuchun are all considered special to this area. As for hotels, in addition to the Green Willow Hotel, there is also a place called the Yangzhou Apartment, which is relatively clean and has Chinese and Western restaurants attached, so if a traveler can stay there, it is more comfortable, but unfortunately there are not many rooms and it is not easy to get one.</p>

<h3>Secretary-General Luo Discusses Evacuating the City's Population – Population Evacuation Committee to be Established Next Week</h3>
<p>Mr. Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, met with reporters on the 3rd to discuss the issue of Shanghai's population evacuation, as follows: Mayor Zhou stated at a meeting with reporters on January 30th that the Shanghai population evacuation committee will be organized soon, scheduled to be formed by the Municipal Government, the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association, and civil groups, and will be established next week. The committee's temporary expenses will be paid from the municipal budget, with 160 million yuan allocated for evacuation subsidies. The purpose of evacuating citizens is to defend against enemy air raids and to evacuate unnecessary personnel to various places due to shortages of food, daily necessities, and fuel. The Municipal Government hopes to evacuate a total of one million people, but the difficulties of evacuation are: (1) inconvenient transportation; (2) poor local security, especially after the lower class citizens are evacuated, their lives are unsustainable, and they turn into vagrants. The target of evacuation is the empty houses in the county seat. It is expected that a concrete plan will be announced next week.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Strictly Punishes Tax Evasion – Two Entertainment Venues Fined</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Luo, concurrent director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, took office, he has been determined to rectify tax revenue, on the one hand preventing corruption by tax collectors, and on the other hand investigating various tax evasion facts by businesses, and strictly cracking down on them. Recently, it was reported that entertainment venues often use tricks to evade entertainment taxes, in an attempt to evade taxes. The bureau immediately sent personnel to conduct secret investigations. It was heard that the Great China Shenqu Theater did not tear off the ticket stubs when selling tickets to the audience at the venue, but allowed the audience to bring the original tickets in. Before the end of the play, the ticket collectors collected all the tickets as unsold tickets, as the basis for concealing and evading entertainment taxes when reporting the entertainment tax the next day. After the secret investigators detained the collected tickets and extra seats tickets and reported them to the bureau, a fine of 277,200 yuan was imposed. In addition, the Xianyue Dance Hall was found to have issued gift certificates (i.e., dance tickets) without date stamps on January 14 this year, and the date stamps affixed to the gift certificates issued on January 21 were blurred and unrecognizable, all of which were deliberately evading taxes in violation of regulations. A fine of 155,000 yuan was imposed. The penalties have been executed separately, and personnel have been sent to continue secret investigations, so that taxpayers or collection venues will be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Pregnant Women Can Apply for Special Sugar Allocation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office, which handles the special allocation of red granulated sugar for pregnant women, previously announced a temporary suspension of accepting applications due to the large number of application letters to be processed. Now that the accumulated cases have been sorted out and those with complete procedures have been allocated, it should continue to accept applications and allocate them according to the adjusted prices approved by the authorities. In the future, application letters from each household must be signed and stamped by the applicant or their family member in accordance with the regulations, stating the detailed address and signed and stamped by the head of the household for verification and allocation, otherwise they will not be accepted. All application letters can be sent by mail, and pregnant women do not need to go in person.</p>
<h3>Order at the North Station Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that the North Railway Station is the only major transportation hub in the city, with tens of thousands of passengers coming and going every day, and in the past, black marketeers and other station staff extorted and harassed passengers, which is beyond description, decided to start reorganizing the station in order to thoroughly rectify traffic and maintain passenger safety. It specially established a North Station Branch Bureau on Jiaotong Road, and selected excellent police officers to be responsible for the order of the North Station. Since the establishment of the bureau, it has strictly enforced its duties. In order to understand the current situation of the area, the reporter specially went to the North Station for inspection. (1) In terms of traffic, the chaotic situation of arbitrarily parked vehicles in front of the station in the past has gradually improved. (2) The entrance to the station originally stipulated that first and second class passengers should enter and exit through the main entrance. In the past, the personnel responsible for security arbitrarily allowed entry and exit without stopping them. Now, they guide passengers in accordance with the regulations to enter the station in an orderly manner. (3) The order inside the station is well maintained, and plainclothes police officers are often dispatched to investigate the actions of bad elements. Passengers line up to board the train in an orderly manner. (4) The situation at the ticket office, formerly known as the "black market," is more orderly than before. The authorities of the China Central Railway have also repeatedly reorganized the ticket office, and the attitude is no longer the same as before. Tickets are sold when available, and sales are stopped when the quota is exceeded. Therefore, passengers can purchase tickets easily and do not need to resort to the black market. (5) In the past, the stalls in front of the station were cluttered and noisy, and the situation was extremely chaotic. Now it has all been improved, which is convenient for merchants and travelers. It is heard that the China Railway authorities are determined to assist the Municipal Government in making further improvements to the order of the North Station.</p>
<h3>Sunday Tram Service Extended</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the public, the Urban Transportation Company has temporarily decided to extend the tram service hours every Sunday. It was implemented yesterday (4th). The early shift runs from 6:30 AM to 10:50 AM, and the late shift runs from 2:00 PM to 8:30 PM. The service hours of all vehicles from Monday to Saturday remain the same as before, with the early shift from 6:30 AM to 10:00 AM and the late shift from 4:30 PM to 8:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Increasing Agricultural Production in Various Regions in the 34th Year (3)</h3>
<p>(1) For the increased planting of rapeseed, cooperatives, trial morning reports, special agricultural reports, etc. should be used in the main rapeseed producing areas as demonstration and seed collection centers. On the one hand, nearby farmers can observe the actual situation, and on the other hand, high-quality seeds should be distributed to promote the utilization of seasonal fallow land, so as to achieve increased production of wheat and rapeseed. (2) In the main townships and towns where sweet potatoes grow, trial agricultural reports and special agricultural reports should be used as cultivation models, and mutual assistance and cooperative associations should be supervised and encouraged to improve their seedling cultivation and planting methods. At harvest time, yield competitions should be held to reward cultivation improvements. The planned subsidy for this work is 30,000 yuan per township this year. (3) In terms of agricultural implements: cooperatives, branches, sub-branches, mutual assistance societies, and other related organizations should be ordered to purchase threshing machines to improve the threshing method and save labor. On the one hand, farmers should be cultivated to develop a spirit of cooperation and habits, as the basis for cooperative production increase. For those who purchase this type of machine, a planned subsidy of 5,000 yuan per machine will be provided. In order to remedy the lack of packing materials, this year, active efforts should be made to produce handicraft products. For those who purchase handicraft manufacturing institutions, a subsidy of half of the purchase cost is planned, but the maximum subsidy is limited to 1,200 yuan per machine. (4) In terms of draught cattle, maintaining agricultural productivity and expanding draught cattle are of the utmost importance. Draught cattle are even more necessary when increasing production and engaging in deep plowing. Therefore, the protection and breeding of draught cattle are of great significance. This year, farmers who purchase draught cattle and breeders should make their best efforts to assist and protect them. (5) The improvement and breeding of breeding livestock should start with livestock. Therefore, the establishment of breeding livestock should be done with all efforts. This year, it is planned to provide a subsidy of 140,000 yuan per head for those who set up studs, and a subsidy of 60,000 yuan per head for those who set up breeding teams. In addition, livestock epidemic prevention is also a necessary facility for production increase. Last year, the serum manufacturing institute of the Ministry of Industry had not yet been established, and general serum and preventive liquids could not be purchased, so this professional project could not be held. Now the institute is preparing to open soon, and it is expected that this year, matters concerning livestock epidemic prevention will be started separately.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the increase in production of industrial crops, the cotton test experiment and seed collection: This year will be completely handled by the Central Agricultural Test Institute, so as to concentrate efforts and make the institute the core of cotton technology improvement in the future. (1) Regarding the general increase in cotton production: such as production purchase and allocation control, since the cooperation and unification of various related agencies last year, the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai have achieved good results. Therefore, this year, the previous policy will continue to be carried out. (2) Hemp production: Hemp is necessary for general industry. This year, it is planned to add 20,000 mu of hemp cultivation outside the work area of the specified hemp promotion group, so that general farmers can be aware of engaging in hemp planting. (3) Castor: Last year, the increase in castor production exceeded expectations as a result of cooperation from all parties.</p>
<p>(D) This year's production increase plan will be announced together with the incentive and subsidy methods after consultation with all related parties. Regarding the training of agricultural technicians: (1) Agricultural instructors: Based on the experience of promoting production increase work last year, it is indispensable to have technical instructors who directly guide farmers' production in agricultural production increase work. Therefore, this year, it is planned to centrally train 100 agricultural instructors in the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute for application and implementation. (2) Agricultural technicians: Last year, the cooperative trained 200 agricultural technicians, but it was not enough for distribution. Therefore, this year, 100 outstanding and promising farmers who have been trained should be selected and given three months of re-training. As soon as the training is completed, they will be distributed to cooperatives in various places to serve and provide guidance to farmers in the area.</p>
<p>(E) Regarding the revitalization of rural side occupations: (1) Learning about rural side occupations: Last year, the production increase work mostly focused on the improvement of agricultural production technology. In terms of agricultural economy, it was not possible to handle it due to time and other reasons. However, if the agricultural economy cannot be revived, it will be difficult to improve agricultural technology, and thus agricultural production increase cannot be fully achieved. Therefore, this year, in addition to concentrating efforts on carrying out the improvement, guidance, and encouragement of agricultural technology in designated areas, special attention should be paid to agricultural and forestry economic issues that are closely related to rural side occupations and farmers' economy. Therefore, lectures on rural side occupations should be stepped up immediately. (2) Subsidies for rural side occupation factories: The importance of rural side occupations has been described in the previous article. Therefore, these workshops should be specially promoted. This year, it is planned to subsidize 20 places, with a planned subsidy of 30,000 yuan. (3) Planning and establishment of agricultural product processing plants: At this time when rural supplies are scarce and the agricultural economy is exhausted, the processing and manufacturing of agricultural products occupies an important position in the economy. Therefore, this year, these processing plants should be actively planned and established, and it is planned to establish eight plants as soon as possible, with a subsidy of 2 million yuan per plant.

<h3>This City's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions Last Week: Drastic Fluctuations in Gold and Government Bonds</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai have continued to evolve over the past week. However, the main reasons are still the rumors surrounding the European situation, the sudden surge in people buying gold, and the growing interest in government bonds. Therefore, apart from the volatile fluctuations in gold and government bonds, the conditions of other Chinese stocks and foodstuffs, while experiencing uneven ups and downs, have remained generally stable and constant throughout the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors. Once the speculative fervor subsides, the market is expected to return to stability. Therefore, the authorities are now closely investigating the illegal activities of speculative merchants and brokers, imposing strict measures to eliminate the evils of manipulation and disruption of the market. Looking back at the fiery red figures within the past week, the extent of the rise and fall was unprecedented. On one day, the largest increase reached about thirty points, with the peak reaching one hundred and forty-three points. At that time, buyers did not show any weakness. However, after the authorities discerned the underlying reasons and detained illegal market manipulators, the rise quickly subsided and drastically fell. However, the upward trend of various consolidated bonds remained strong. From Wednesday to Friday, only popular Chinese stocks experienced a sharp rise with brisk trading. On Saturday, due to the tightening restrictions on electricity, people felt fatigued, and the stock market turned from gains to losses, with a sluggish trend. The interbank call loan rate for money firms remained at the original rate of 6.5%, while the informal rate, due to the approaching Lunar New Year settlement, experienced urgent demand for funds, and the interbank lending rate continued to rise. The shortage of market chips has been slightly eased after the Central Bank of China issued new banknotes. As for various industrial and commercial sectors, the factory industry has not yet resolved the problem of electricity supply, making it difficult to restore production in the short term, and business is struggling to improve. Merchants in various industries have been unable to smoothly purchase goods, and it is difficult to suppress the rising prices in retail stores. In addition, due to the approaching Lunar New Year, residents are actively purchasing goods, holding up market prices. Among the daily necessities for the people, such as rice, grains, oil, sugar, and vegetables, prices have slightly increased, especially the price of rice, which has risen more sharply.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Works Holds Bureau Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Bureau of Public Works was ordered to merge with the Public Works Department of the former First District Public Office on August 1st last year, it has been actively reorganized, and various plans have been implemented step by step. However, because the former Public Works Department of the First District Public Office was formed by merging the Public Works Department of the former Shanghai Municipal Council and the Public Works Department of the former French Municipal Council, the personnel situation is relatively complex. It was originally scheduled to adjust the personnel during the first month of this year, but it was postponed due to circumstances. It is now learned that Director Zhang Enlin, in order to actively promote various tasks, convened a bureau affairs meeting in the bureau's secretarial office on the (3rd) day prior. All personnel above the level of director of the bureau attended. First, Chief Secretary Zhang Hongzhong clarified the purpose of the meeting, instructing each department to immediately fill in and report in detail on the various work plans that should be established and abolished, so as to plan in a unified manner and enable the work to proceed simply and quickly.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball League: Zhongbei vs. Jiashen; Zhongbei Hualian Changed to Friendly Match Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the basketball league, the Class A first-round final between Hualian and Zhongbei, originally scheduled to be held last night, was changed to a friendly exhibition match because the audience in the Army Dormitory stadium was too crowded, and the court was occupied, reducing the court to a size that was not suitable for competition. The Shanghai Basketball Association had decided in advance that this game would not be a formal match. As a result, Zhongbei won Hualian with a score of 46 to 39, with a score of 31 to 21 in the first half. The maintenance of order in the West YMCA stadium deserves the attention of the basketball association authorities. Last night, some spectators even fainted due to overcrowding. Shantou Team won against V Team. In the first half, V Team led with a score of 16 to 14. The final score was 25 to 25, with an extension of five minutes. Shantou Team won by one point, 28 to 27. In the women's group, Yikang won against Xuebai, with intense competition, 21 to 13, with each team scoring eight points in the first half.</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule: Tonight, the Green Team will have a fierce battle against the Three Provinces Team in the women's group. The schedule is as follows: Three Provinces vs. Green Team (Women) at 6:00 PM, Qingxie vs. Zhongbei B (A &amp; B) at 6:45 PM, Zhongbei vs. Jiashen (Jiashen) at 7:45 PM.</p>
<h3>Middle School Table Tennis Competition</h3>

<p>Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, municipal administration in this city has shown a new and promising outlook. Citizens unanimously expect the rejuvenation of municipal administration, and the authorities have repeatedly declared their determination. The goals of officials and the public are completely the same. However, how to further enable officials and the public to work together and achieve the goal as soon as possible is crucial. This newspaper is willing to contribute a little effort in this regard. We have specially established a column called "Shanghai Municipal Administration" to publish the authorities' intentions regarding municipal measures, the public's demands, the public's suggestions for municipal measures, and the demands on the authorities, in order to communicate opinions, promote mutual understanding, and then work together. Starting this week, it will be published every Saturday. We respectfully hope that the relevant authorities of municipal organs and the public will contribute articles to this publication based on what they have seen, heard, and want to say. Currently, the issue of dispersing the population is extremely important. We hope that readers will study and contribute articles on how to plan and how to promote this issue. Once published, we will send a small remuneration.</p>
