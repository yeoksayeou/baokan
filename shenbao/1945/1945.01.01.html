<h3>國府定今晨舉行　元旦日慶祝典禮　同時頒布大赦令與民更始</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　三十四年元旦，茲已來臨，值此歲度更新之始，恰在大東亞戰爭步入決勝階段之時，民族解放戰之光榮前途，已與春陽以俱至。國府爲迎接此具有重大意義之一日，特定一日十時，在國府大禮堂舉行慶祝三十四年元旦典禮，國府所屬各院部會處文武官員，均將參與慶典，所有參與慶典官員，文官着國民禮服，或籃袍黑掛，配勳表，武官着軍常服，佩刀佩勳表。茲錄慶典程序如次：（一）奏樂，（二）各院部會處長官入席，（三）主席就位，（四）全體肅立，（五）唱國歌，（六）向國旗及國父遺像行三鞠躬，（七）主席訓詞，（八）各院部會長官全體向主席慶賀，行一鞠躬，（九）各院部會處長官相向行一鞠躬禮，（十）梁院長率領三呼中華民國萬歲，（十一）奏樂，（十二）禮成。</p>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　國府陳代主席，於茲中華民國建國三十四年來臨之初，爰圖與民更始，咸予維新，特依據國府組織法第六條之規定，發表明令，舉行大赦，至於詳細條章，已着行政各院部會安愼擬具，茲誌府令如次：</p>
<p>國民政府令（民國三十四年一月一日）</p>
<p>我中華民國建國之三十有四年，亦即我國民政府還都之五稔，簡者天不悔禍，患難相尋，戰氛所屆，寰宇鼎沸，我汪故主席躬排萬難，首導和平，與盟邦循共榮之坦途，樹我國百年之大計，五稔之中，睦鄰同患，敉境安民。興學建軍，况轅惠賈，凡臨經邦立榮之宏綱，罔不次第具興，而　志未伸，中道殂逝，本代主席勉任艱巨，時懷成懼，追念六年以來，元氣未復，民生塗炭，市井凋殘，黃庋就荒，絃歌久輟，因之學業不修，法軌失守，　民奸吏，怵迫恰非，揆厥情原，彌用嗟惋，或則惑于詭敵，誤入歧途，或則逞于血氣，致罹法網，懷我前賢不教而誅之戒，推古人問知不坐之條，茍非怙終悍惡，允宜曲予矜全，茲謹本汪故主席至仁之懷，特頒肆赦之典，適之陽和溥育，品　田庚之候，爰據國民政府組織法第六條之規定，舉行大赦，幷着有關各院部會妥具條章，恪恭將事，用示與民更始，咸予維新之義，凡我國人，尤宜仰諱斯旨，提撕奮厲，蔚爲報國之貞　，濯垢滌澈，淬勵國民之德性，庶迓鴻休，式揚偉烈，有厚望焉，此令，代理主席陳公博。</p>
<h3>努力三大工作　完成復興使命　陳代主席元旦致辭</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　陳代主席三十四年元旦致詞如下：</p>
<p>在去年（三十三年）元旦，汪故主席曾昭示我們，承着中日同盟條約大東亞共同宣言之後，中日友好關係之增進，有了更光明的途徑，大東亞各國家民族之聯盟，有了更明允的準則，大東亞戰爭決戰之勝利，有了更確實的把握，中國的獨立東亞的解放，有了更可靠的保障，對着這前途的光明，用不着徘徊瞻顧，對着今後的前進方針和步驟，也用不着標新立異。我們祗有一本歷來的政策，向着「肅正思想」「保障治安」「增加生產」三大工作爲更進一步的努力，拿出全副精神，放在決戰第一上面，以謀大東亞共榮戰爭目的之完遂，大東亞共榮建設之積極發展，由此而完成興復中華保衛東亞的雙重使命。</p>
<p>去年我們最感覺不幸的，汪故主席昭示我們前進的方針及步驟以後，即告臥病，旋于三月二日赴日本養疴，本於十一月十日不幸殂逝，一年以來，領導乏人，使所昭示的三大工作成績，未能美滿，道是我們引爲遺憾，而感覺非常慚愧的。我們今後祗有更應加倍努力，使三大工作得以完成，而使中國得以真正獲得自由與解放。在去年十一月二十日本人就任代理主席與行政院長之初，曾聲明汪主席手定之政策，皆爲本人奉行之政策，凡汪主席生前之設施，皆爲本人今日之設施，</p>
<p>聲明五點</p>
<p>自勉勉人</p>
<p>更且聲明第一點，反對帝國主義爲國民政府之夙志，亦爲全國人民之決心，本此決意勇往邁進，成敗利鈍在所不計。第二點，決本汪主席之遺志，以求達到黨不可分，　國須統一之偉大志願，無論如何艱苦，必須完成。第三點，決意澄清吏治，以副汪主席昭示聲明，悉本汪故主席遺志及全國人民之願望，而圖自力更生。今後對外務求國家之獨立與自由，而對內則務求國家之和平與統一，持此兩義，謹以自勉，並勗勉國人。</p>
<p>今日國家由長期戰爭之階段，而入於決戰時期，或者物資更形缺乏，民生更形困苦，但最後之勝利必屬於堅忍沉毅之國家。吾人爲求解放，爲求國家之真正獨立自由，不祗需要忍耐，更應需要團結廉潔政治之初衷，倘有荼毒人民傷害國本者，無論何人必當懲罰。第四點，今日生產已漸停頓，無可諱言，今後必使軍需民需雙方並重，以鼓勵人民致力於生產之繼續。第五點，軍事政治必須配合，在軍則宜能紀律，整飭教育，在政則宜崇尚廉潔，實行建設，凡此不祗需要沉毅，更應需要邁進，此所望於國民了解者一。</p>
<p>全面和平</p>
<p>悉力以赴</p>
<p>中國危機現在四伏茍不努力，或則淪爲決戰之戰塲，或則淪爲全面之赤化，或則再淪爲英美之殖民地，如是則國民政府數年以來所努力取銷不平等條約。收回租界。撤消治外法權等成果，一一敗於旣成，故全國人民宜乘時奮起，要求全面統一和平，合全國之人力，以根絕赤禍，以排除在華之英美外力，更實行中日同盟條約，使中國得以完成自由與獨立，此所望於國民了解者二。</p>
<p>要之，中國必須統一，然後始能獲得國家之完全獨立，亦惟有和平始能獲得國家之完全自由，更必堅忍沉毅，始能合其全力以獲得今後國家與人民悉力以赴，使中華得以復興，東亞得以保衛，則本人與有厚望焉。</p>
<h3>全國戮力同心　爭取最後勝利　小磯首相歲首談話</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日本內閣總理大臣小磯首相，發表新年談話如次：際此聖戰第四年之新春，謹祝天皇陛下聖壽無疆。聖上於八十六屆　會開會典禮時，曾下賜勒語謂：今日戰局益愈危急，實爲億兆一心，傾舉全力擊滅敵人之秋，吾人實誠惶誠恐，一億國民相互提携，誓死滅敵，突破國難以安聖慮。今前方將士以一身擔當殲敵之大任，勇戰奮鬥，尤其決定戰局歸趨之菲律賓戰綫，日陸海軍之特別攻擊隊日以繼夜，奮勇出擊，爲國犧牲，其摧毀敵人之侵略企圖，我後方一億國民應以此種義烈爲殷鑑，將崇高之精神表現於日常生活中，各就本位，盡全力增强戰力，以期擊滅敵人。此次戰爭擴至全世界，人類悉數參加，故其規模之大與國際關係之複雜，乃有史以來所罕有者。論其勝敗，則且戰且失戰意者，終須敗北，以旺盛戰意戰至最後，努力支持國家者，必獲最後勝利，已不待言。伴隨戰爭之進展，吾人日常生活更加困難，且空襲將趨激化，故切望一億同胞力謀充實生活，强化防空態勢，堅持戰至最後勝利而後已之決意，增强生產。本年爲戰局最後之一年，政府爲此已採取一切施策，以期與諸君共同奮鬥爭取勝利。本年實爲日本大化革新後之一千三百年，當時日本內中情勢困難已極，妖雲彌漫，後因革新而將皇威宜揚於中外，恢復日本之本來面目。今英美在東亞之勢力雖悉被驅逐，但彼等已開始反攻，企圖將大東亞永遠置於其隸屬之下，故肅清大東亞之妖雲，使大東亞之本來姿態永遠安定，實爲今日之事，吾人應以此種確信與大東亞各國互相提携，擊破敵人之反攻，以期完成共同之使命。</p>
<h3>汪夫人贈金　供盟邦購機</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　汪故主席夫人陳璧君中委，鑒於最近盟邦陸海空軍在菲律賓方面正與敵美軍浴血奮戰，迭建殊勳，對盟軍將　之忠勇殊深欽佩，特於日前贈金五百萬元，親送盟邦駐華派遣軍總司令部當局，作爲購機之用。</p>
<h3>岡村總司令官　元旦日談話　以必勝信念完成任務</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　日岡村中國派遣軍總司令官，於民國三十四年元旦日發表談話如次：際茲大東亞戰爭第四年開始，派遣軍全體將兵謹祝聖壽萬歲與皇運之日隆，實不勝感奮，聖戰目的已於大詔中明示，派遣軍將兵當於陸海兩面，粉碎英美侵略東亞之野望，今仍在決死奮鬥，本年實爲決勝之年，相信吾一億民衆，當能奉戴大詔，無分前綫後方，愈鞏固滅敵之決意，昂揚傳統之精神，於物心兩面爲獻身決戰，則勝利必屬於我。中國戰綫方面，於昨秋將中國西南要域駐渝美空軍根據地完全潰滅，我戰略態勢已愈加强，決戰準備亦因而着着完成，渝軍尚集在西部一角苟延殘喘，依賴美國之物力援助，繼續抗戰，然已無可觀之戰力。美空軍以內地爲基地，或圖侵略日本本土，或殘殺無辜之支邦民衆，圖使和平地區化爲焦土，然我軍痛擊敵軍之日已近，我派遣軍全體將兵，當此新春之際，重申必勝信念，澈底擊滅英美，達成所負任務而後已。於茲吾人除感謝國府參戰以來之舉滅恊力外，並祝國府之基礎愈趨鞏固與四億民衆之安康。最後衷心感謝我後方官民之支援，並切望我在華日僑堅忍持久，克服萬難，向前發展。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>今天是民國三十四年的第一天。</p>
<p>昨天是三十三年的歲尾，我們對於過去的一年，旣已提出應該反省的許多地方了，今天根據昨天的反省，對於未來的一年應該怎樣着手去做呢？我們覺得基本上仍不外是：</p>
<p>第一·求政治之澈底清明，</p>
<p>第二·求治安之真正確立，</p>
<p>第三·求生產之切實增加，</p>
<p>第四·求民生之適當安定。</p>
<p>關於第一點清明政治，我們認爲去年十二月二十四日本報「斷然强化政治」一文中所提出的革新政治四個原則，可以作爲基礎，即：</p>
<p>一·强力整治，</p>
<p>二·專家整治，</p>
<p>三·親民政治，</p>
<p>四·廉潔政治。</p>
<p>唯有確立强力政治—組織嚴密，機構健全，人事合理，　能使各種工作做得好，政府施策得以推行無阻，而奸詐之徒也無從把弄敗壞。</p>
<p>唯有確立專家政治，達到政治上的適才適事，　能使官民合作無間，共同實踐參戰任務。建立民意機關，給與人民以參政機會，是很重要的事。</p>
<p>唯有確立廉潔政治，剷除貪污風氣，根絕索詐行爲，　能使官紀振肅，政事公正無私，而國策得以推行無阻。所以必須用嚴刑重典懲辦貪污索詐。</p>
<p>同時，我們更不可忽略的，目前是在大東亞戰爭時期，尤其在決戰階段，大東亞十億民族的生死存亡，繋此決戰階段。所以，今年度政府與人民最主要的使命，是一致恊力戰爭，一切努力，一切活動，當然應以爭取軍事勝利爲第一。可是，一致恊力戰爭，決不是口頭高唱或是文字鼓吹所能單獨獲致實效的。必須政府充分發揮領導人民的力量，充分誘發人民所應貢獻的力量，以之恊助戰爭，才於爭取勝利有所實益。</p>
<p>所以，一致恊力戰爭，必先做到政治配合，政府當局，自當特別注意這個原則。所謂政治配合，上面已經提出基本的四點，政治清明，是政治本身的振作與革新。必先有了清明的政治，然後可以做到，治安確立，生產增加，民生安定。所以，第一點是政治本身健全，第二三四點，是由於健全政治所發生的良好作用。這四點基本工作，實際上都是今年政府與人民的重要課題。如果不能做到，那末，就是政治失敗，也就無從談起一致恊力戰爭。</p>
<p>綜上所論，我們願在今年的歲首，提出「政治競賽」的口號，就是今年的工作方向，應該是政治競賽，競賽的目標是什麽呢？也就是上面提出的四個基點。至於如何競賽的具體方法，我們將不辭一得之見，容再申論。</p>
<p>日駐華各機關</p>
<p>破除元旦繁文</p>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　值此大東亞戰爭日趨苛烈之際，適逢歲序之更新，聞日本在華各機關以在此東亞十億民族全力對付戰爭時期，對於新年慣例之交換賀詞與拜年等舉動，決不舉行。</p>
<h3>日特攻部隊　建偉大戰績　兩日中擊沉敵艦十艘</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　遭日航空部隊猛擊滿身受創之敵運輸船團，企圖繼續由蘇祿海北上向明多羅烏增援，二十九，三十，兩日復經日方特攻隊五飛行隊之攻擊。二十九日午後五時，一誠飛行隊首先出擊，其中一架命中於蘇祿海北進中之敵運輸艦一艘，使起火沉沒。同日深夜十二時進襲隊之三機同桑　塞附近之敵船團攻擊，其一架命中運輸船一艘，立即起火，其餘二架因深夜目的無從找得，安返基地。三十日晨七時皇華隊之三機，亦於桑霍塞海面對準敵運輸船三艘中之一艘予以擊沉，其他二艘起火。同日午後桑霍塞附近又有敵艦船出現，於東方海面有運輸船二十二艘，南方海面則有大型輸送船二艘。巡洋艦及驅逐艦五艘，進擊隊之五架當即對之襲擊，計於西方海面使運輸艦兩艘起火，南方海面大型運輸船一艘起火，三分鐘後即行沉沒。其他二架則各自於南方海面擊沉巡洋艦二艘。特工隊出擊之二日間，除四架不明戰果外，其餘十架則獲得擊沉敵艦十艘之煊赫戰果。</p>
<h3>泰首相祝辭</h3>
<p>盤谷三十一日中央社電　泰國首相阿巴溫氏，爲祝新春開始，特對同盟國日本發表祝賀談話其要意如次：際此新年開始，各國民爲祝禱幸福，互申慶祝，同時報國，決意益爲鞏固。此次新春，國民諸君之內心無不繋念於作戰，蓋爲完成作戰目的，集結國民總力，乃　絕對必要者。吾人每思及大東亞戰爭以來，日軍所收獲之赫赫戰果，更確信日本國民諸君必勝之信念必更堅定。泰國民爲大東亞各國家各民族之自由及興隆，對戰局下日本之崇高理想極爲理解，並遵照盟約，儘可能予以協力。本日喜逢元旦佳節，吾全泰國民對日軍之勝利及日本國之興隆，特衷心表示祝禱。</p>
<h3>蘇各機關團體　元旦舉行團拜</h3>
<p>蘇州三十一日中央社電　蘇省黨部會同省政府，於三十四年元旦日上午十時，召集省會各機關部隊團體學校，在省府大禮堂舉行團拜。</p>
<h3>紐約食無肉</h3>
<p>馬德里三十一日中央社電　德國社訊，據紐約息：紐約之屠夫仍繼續罷工，結果紐約市民已五日不知肉味。一部份屠戶業已復業，但未能有肉出售，大致增高肉價後，工潮即可解決。</p>
<h3>谷大使說明　當前局勢　中日應共同完成使命</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　日谷大使於元旦日發表談話，說明當前局勢，並就中·日兩大民族貫澈道義提携，打開戰後混亂窘困，表示確信，茲誌談話原文如次：</p>
<p>展開關係</p>
<p>存亡決戰</p>
<p>敵美之反攻，經過去年一年，已形本格化，逐漸迫近我本土附近之防禦綫。同時，歐洲方面盟邦德國，亦在其本土附近迎舉英美及蘇聯之大軍，展開關係民族存亡之決戰，到此皇紀第二千六百另五年之元旦，謹祝皇國彌榮，並正視此前　曾有之國難，是爲國奮鬥死而後已。徵諸波斯與希臘，羅馬與太基古代新歷史暨新秩序之代替腐朽舊秩序，莫不經過數次痛苦，此謂歷史之過程，且未來愈偉大產生之痛苦亦愈深。自前年中·日兩國立脚於本來面目，走上道義之大道以來，已經二載，現已進入激烈之戰局，值此激烈之對英美作戰中，中國戰力物資之提供，實爲必然的要求，然所謂對華　政策的道義交誼，與戰况物資的要求，有時難免矛盾相尅，但歷史爲解決矛盾統一相尅之連續創造，而現在已展開建國理想之道義歷史，目前日本之前進，已使大東亞共榮圈各民族，漸由舊有英美體制中解放。</p>
<p>努力奮</p>
<p>强化防空</p>
<p>因戰事之進展，日常生活益加困難，且空襲益有激化之趨勢，一億同胞，應切實明朗奮鬥努力，以謀實際生活，强化防空態勢，堅持獲得勝利爲止之決意，以期增强生產，使此一年爲戰局進展之年，本人不勝切望者，政府亦爲此研討諸般施策，而期與各同胞共同向勝利之途。本年適距大化革新整一千三百年，當時內外情勢困難艱險，然一旦改施宣揚國威於內外，恢復皇國之原來面目，目下英美於在東亞之勢力悉遭驅逐之後，捲土重來，謀永久奴化東亞各民族而開始反攻，故本年爲肅清英美之年，晋人　本此種信念，與大東亞諸國同甘共苦，粉碎敵人之企圖，緊握建設大東亞之共同理念。在日本本身方面，屬朝鮮，台灣同胞，亦已出以妥善措置，使其將來與日本內地同胞受同等待遇，成爲名副其實之日本國民，日本先自正而體道義精神作正人之態度，必定使千萬人燃起敢爲天下先之信念。</p>
<p>英美暴露</p>
<p>制覇目的</p>
<p>反之，面顧英美以往之所爲，不得不感深刻之感激與堅定自信，彼等空談自由，毫無誠意態度，觀於大西洋　章事實而信然，尤如最近之希臘內亂，實已充分暴露彼等以帝國主義制　世界之目的，已無處理歐洲問題的資格。英美軍在其登陸之國家，自稱爲解放者，自由之擁護者，但彼等在我國之行爲如何，巴特里奧之叛變，並未能救其祖國，法國人對於特戈爾亦不表歡迎，在希臘方面，則與解放者英軍發生武力鬥爭，故　溯蘇聯已往克服被德軍壓迫之困難，要求遠離其本國境，在法國方面，展開激戰綫，獨力維持東部戰綫之事實，誠不解自動要求英美軍在自己之國土登陸，對自己國民國土加以航空遊擊戰，其以屬何在也。吾等與之交戰之敵，爲目依其物量之英美軍及喪失此種民族自覺之重慶性格，戰局現已極欲激烈，但英美仍有執拗之戰意，其　漢口實施之無差別轟炸，預期更將擴大其規模空襲各地，吾等應忍耐倫敦·漢堡·柏林·莫斯科所遭遇之轟炸。</p>
<p>中日民族</p>
<p>道義提携</p>
<p>際此元旦，確信大東亞之大民族，中日兩民族，貫澈道義之提携，爲完遂戰爭，打開戰後混亂與窘困，建設大東亞所不可缺少之基礎。想起去年之今日，汪故主席繼承國父孫總理之偉業，力言無犧牲即無獨立自由，宣誓兩國國民同生共死，兩民族更應克服眼前之困難，完遂兩國共同使命，其子孫應在互相敬愛中，各盡所長，最後對完成此偉業犧牲之兩國英靈，謹致無限感謝，並祈在各地奮鬥之日軍將士武運長久。</p>

<h3>展望戰局的現階段　（一）　上海日本陸海外三報道部長座談</h3>
<p>大陸新報社，爲紀念大東亞戰爭第四年，曾邀請上海日本陸軍報道部出　部長，中國方面艦隊報道部松島部長，及大使館情報部松平部長三氏，舉行座談會，各就今後戰局發抒意見。座談記錄載日文「大陸」月刋　年號，茲特　譯如次：</p>
<p>大陸新報社：茲承上海報道宣傳方面的指導當局陸海軍及大使館三報道部長　冗光臨，不勝榮幸之至！際此大東亞戰爭進入第四年的時候，　　三位談一談現在的戰局，以及國民對此的觀感。茲請松平報道部長先　　　論。</p>
<p>松平：不敢不敢。現在自照貴社所望，展開談話，先來展望一下戰局的現階段，並間顧一下大東亞戰爭三週年紀念以來的情况。現請松島艦隊報道部長談談太平洋作戰的經過。</p>
<p>海陸合作</p>
<p>同心一致</p>
<p>松島：過去一年，是英美，特別是美國，在太平洋方面反攻最劇烈的一年。自從去年末吉爾伯特方面的反攻以來，本年初即行進犯馬紹爾方面，其後於二月間進　特魯克，未幾，敵軍太平洋總反攻的觸手且伸向馬里亞的方面。一方面，繼拉巴爾的猛烈攻擊及阿特米拉爾蒂群島的佔領之後，復出新幾內亞北岸的必阿克　，到了六月間，終於登陸塞　島。戰局至此遂進入極爲重大的決戰階段。這樣，麥克奧塞軍的菲島攻略戰遂比預定約早二個月，以九月十五日歷洛泰，培里琉方面的攻擊爲序幕而展開。協力此戰的美太平洋艦隊，並侵襲琉球及台灣方面，以此爲契機，日美的決戰乃告開始。這個決戰時期可說非常之早，不消說，美國對於世界戰局的異常焦慮，尤其是重慶的危機及美國內的情勢等事，與　　　關係。由於這種　　　　，美國不得不對　　　　行非常冒險且無準備的作戰。至於日本，早就預料有這樣的一日，將大陸作戰與太平洋作戰的密切關聯性加以考慮，着着從事決戰準備。關於大陸作戰等，以後請出　部長詳述。太平洋方面，塞　島失陷前後，戰略勢態稍見不　，但因準備充分，迅速將戰力作最高的發揚，旋即一舉改變不利的勢態，一切都很順利，遠在預定以上，不獨敵軍的八九成受到嚴重打擊，而且我方的戰力較前更見充實，敵方因此反而處於非常不利的境况中，而這次的決戰也就自此展開。賴皇上的神威，台灣及菲島洋面的大戰以後，雷伊泰島方面的戰爭中，也獲得甚大的戰果，敵太平洋艦隊的主力受到了深刻的打擊。其後，在雷伊泰方面的劇烈決戰中，更着着粉碎了敵美的企圖。尤因陸海軍航空部隊的勇戰奮鬥，以及特別攻擊隊，空挺隊等的敢死襲擊，充分發揚日本精神之粹，使敵軍心胆俱寒，戰局的展開顯然有利我方。不過，敵美此際也不惜使盡手段，企圖在菲律賓找到立脚點，以期切斷南方資源地帶與我方的輸送動脈，更進一步在中國登陸。因此，其勢力大減的海上航空兵力猶如殘餘的太平洋艦隊勾結，以數量上尚有餘裕的運輸船將兵力和資材注入雷伊泰島。而最近的形勢，似乎尚　運用一部分的兵力在其他地點—據地方宣傳，是在呂宋島或別處—試行上陸作戰。他方面，與此有特別重大關係的，如各位所知，即爲中國大陸方面及馬里亞納方面的對日戰略轟炸，這當然含有政治上思想上的作用，同時還想由此減弱我方出產力。所以今後的戰局，在太平洋方面可分爲二個，即環繞雷伊泰島的菲律賓方面的決戰，以及與此呼應，出成都及馬里亞納兩基地實行對付日本本部的航空戰。雷伊泰島方面的決戰，不論在那一點，對於我方都很有利，這是太平洋方面迄今所有的戰鬥所難比擬的。何以故？因爲制海權制空權大體均在我方當中，而我軍陸上的配備也甚有利。從而其作戰的主導權亦爲我方所握。祗是對於從大陸及馬里亞納基地飛來空　北九州與首都附近的　　，今後值得重視，務須採取必要手段。</p>
<p>還有一點，即是英國的企圖。歐洲方面的戰局，日下難呈膠着狀態，但因德國海軍力的關係，英國的海軍力頗有相當餘裕，其兵力的一部分已逐漸從地中海方面或非洲方面調到印度及澳洲來，這是可想而知的，並且最近也有如此的情報。此外，以錫蘭島爲基地的英國東洋艦隊，最近似亦有所企圖，且有一部似已前進，從澳洲東岸而出西南太平洋戰綫，即新幾內亞方面。同時，法·義·荷等所謂敗殘艦隊的一部分—力量當然極小—已在協助麥克沃塞或尼米資的攻勢，也是可想而知的。因此，在今日的情勢之下，印度洋方面的敵軍攻勢，雖則是牽制性的，却也具有一點規模了。</p>
<p>除此以外，敵軍也從北方來，但因天氣關係，現在不過是極少數的飛機回驅逐艦等較快部隊的機動作戰而已。</p>
<p>在上述的情勢下，海軍正和陸軍密切合作，同心一致，背中國大陸而列陣，以　必滅敵的信念，在太平洋戰綫奮戰。當此萬戶更新之際，決心在空戰第四年中給與敵方決定性的打擊。</p>
<p>松平：關於太平洋作戰的情形，正如松島部長所說一樣，與大陸的作戰有非常密切的關係，敵人似亦依據此種道理而　。關於這點，請出淵部長將大陸作戰及菲律賓方面陸軍活動的情况，綜述一番。</p>
<p>陸戰戰果</p>
<p>可期待</p>
<p>出淵：把大東亞戰爭第三年的大陸作戰總括起來說，可說是對美決戰的色彩愈加濃厚了。本年四月以降開始的湘豫作戰以及其後的廣西作戰中，顯然是以敵美爲對象的。這一點，由作戰開始後不及日本政府發表的聲明，以及其後最高指揮官的聲明等，即可明白。日軍此次的作戰，是在摧毀中日事變以來暗地裏搗亂東亞的真正敵人美國於大陸之上。美國在大陸上的野心，不消說，是想把大陸作爲根據地，空襲我本部，切斷日本和南方共榮圈的連洛，並圖空襲菲島台灣。敵美爲謀實現這個野心，一面在大陸上建設航空基地羣，一面唆使渝軍抵擋日軍，可是，由於這次的大進攻作戰，中國東南及西南的航空基地羣全被擊破。以長沙飛機塲爲始，衝陽柳州，桂林，南甯等主要敵航空根據地約二十處，全在我軍控制之下，敵美的野心因此大受打擊。並且突破貴州省省境，進　貴州省會貴陽，一方面更由南甯方面前進，以與越南連擊，傳和昭南相　。由於此次作戰，已將中國大陸南北　斷，使協助美軍的重慶勢力分裂爲二，而且重慶所依賴的，同時也是美國所依　的資源地帶，也大半被切　了。因此，重慶在政治經濟方面由於此戰的結果，想必已受相當重大的打擊。此次作戰與過去　大陸上的　作戰所不同的地方，就是所謂關於空中兵力的制空權問題。在這次大陸縱斷作戰中，因不斷受到優勢的敵航空兵力的妨害，作戰上發生種種困難，特別是補給方面，嘗到了從來未見的困難，水路陸路簡直一樣，在白　是不能行動的，換一句話說，就是補給的戰鬥。這點在太平洋方面的作戰中也是一樣的。總之，大陸上面的戰事已有迄今所無的極大的戰術變化。</p>
<p>菲律賓雷伊泰島的戰况亦然。敵軍人數，僅就此方所知的說，大約有八師，約十萬人左右。與此相對，我方在數次增援及海軍的大捷之後，自下到處均已壓倒敵軍，但對地上戰鬥有莫大影響的制空權，則雙方航空部隊正在劇烈爭奪中。最近，由於陸海軍特攻隊，挺身肉搏隊等的活躍，敵機塲遭受破壞，已與敵美航空兵力甚大損害，將來的戰果是可期待的。</p>

<h3>土田公使　發表歲首辭　傾全力於決戰摧毀頑敵</h3>
<p>日駐滬特命全權公使土田　氏，發表歲首辭如次：</p>
<p>値茲迎逢皇紀六百零五年這際，謹先向天皇陸下致敬，及對海陸將士之奮戰苦鬥，衷心表示謝意。大東亞戰爭目開始以來，今巳進入第四年，迎逢新春佳節之日，正乃日美以菲律賓爲中心展開決戰　菲律賓海面遭日軍慘敗之敵人，而今不可不認作巳有相當強固之反攻準備，由於雷伊泰明多羅島之戰況，即可表明敵人之反攻意圖。而忠義萬世之帝國海陸軍，以特別攻擊隊作先鋒，全員肉彈拼撞攻擊殲滅恃物量之敵人，爲獲得戰爭之勝利，必持續死鬥。坐鎭菲律賓之防衛皇土及護持國體之大精神，乃悠久三千年建國精華之表現，一億國民感而仰泣，大東亞諸國諸民族同聲讚嘆，鑒於菲律賓決戰塲所顯現之必死攻擊精神，自由特別攻擊隊爲先導，引入勝利之大道，一億國民宜速起作特別攻擊隊之後盾，傾注全力於決戰，克服萬難，一切戰化，乃現戰局下之要務，堅守本位工作，一億國民均成特別攻擊隊之隊員，其必能摧毀惡敵無疑。尤以旅居華中地區之國民，於此時期，須認淸自身爲中日同盟實踐者之一員，有盡確保中國人對戰爭之所寄與之責任，即是以大民族之胸襟，明朗豁達屬事而徹底戰時行動，實踐決戰生活，以深中國人之信賴，中日兩國民携手共向完成大東亞戰爭邁進。今臨決戰之昭和二十年序首，三呼皇國萬歲，重申決意，誓滅宿敵，以有應於聖旨，此乃深爲期待者也</p>

<h3>近藤司令長官　歲首獻辭　堅定信念爭取決戰勝利</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊司令長官近藤信竹大將，於茲卅四年元旦發表「歲首獻辭」如次：新歲伊始，於大陸第一綫，謹向宮城遙拜，訢祝天皇萬歲，國運昌隆。回顧去年開始，英美反攻之勢，日形熾烈，自十月以來時局突入決戰階段，今正以菲律賓爲中心，而展開激戰，本年乃決定大東亞戰爭之最後歸趨，吾人當感此年意義之重大。聖戰三年舉國上下，於鐵石之團結與同生共死之盟邦協力下，摧毀敵人戰力，於政治戰爭兩方，均保有不敗功績，永垂靑史，燦照人間。大東亞十億民衆，則於共榮理想之下，破除萬難，勇猛邁進。敵方之反攻，常亦不可經視，其國內雖隊藏極多矛盾與弱點，而其爭取世界霸權之野心，雖足　　，但於恃優厚之物量而傲作重重反擊之今日，暴露其最後之窘態。尤須注意之點，國民於萬分熱情下，不得有絲毫疏忽。當此時機，中國方面艦隊與中國派遣軍於緊密速繫之下，以大陸太平洋形諸一環之決戰情勢中，出敵不意，先發制人，爲完遂作戰目的奮鬥，將兵乃赤誡護國，克盡大義。戰局所趨，大陸戰綫之地位，日益嚴重，海陸空三面當發揮最大威力，同時大陸之政治經濟之使命，亦當確立。予信於此乾坤一擲之決戰，誓必繫減英美。最近西歐戰綫德軍之反攻，鬼神莫敵，此乃可作吾人之範例，吾人應本海陸特攻隊之鬥意，以示一億鐵力之敢鬥精神，蓋戰繫於轉機，勝敗之決，在於兩軍激戰最艱難之時，此時若能高敵一寸頭地，勝利之榮冠乃得，此事古去今來，已有明例，故我等須堅持不移之信念，處理當前難局，而作必死之努力，勝利之機，庶幾把握焉。</p>
<h3>本市最近一週　金融工商市況　一般情形尙見穩定</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週間堅趨平穩，烚亦紋銀及華股均求見若何變動，蓋因國歷年關決算關係，銀錢各業緊縮抵押放欵問題，資金調運純滯，而當局取締投機，嚴密監視，市儈無法活動，交易清閒。下半週各市場休市，人心閒散，金融機關中雖有因財政部强化金融機構與業務嚴厲執行，但對於正當合法業務絕對極力維護，故整個金融堅固穩定。工商各業方而仍以電力限制，生產無能增强，物資調劑供需，未見平衡，物價漲風雖稍平戢，但前途未可樂觀。食用物品，持貨者依然堅持不願貶價脫售，一般社會市民，殷望當局速謀疏通原料來源，恢復生產，對於取締囤積居奇，抑平物價，須有澈底有效制裁辦法，以安民心。</p>
<h3>所得稅局派員　清查催征</h3>
<p>上海所得稅局，自羅局長光煦接事後，積極推動稅務，稅收極爲暢旺，大部份商號均已繳稅，間有少數商號漏未繳納，該局爲普遍催征，養成商民自動納稅起見，決定自今年一月四日起，增派大批調查員分成十五組，每組率領稅警一名，前往各市區各馬路挨戶調查，如發現有未繳稅商號，當塲責令塡表申報，倘有抗拒情事，即行照章勒停營業示儆，預計一個月可以淸查完竣，以重稅政。</p>
<h3>財局催報　明年收入概算</h3>
<p>市財政局以三十四年全市各項稅款，收入總額急待編製概算書，早經分令所屬各區稽征處，限七日內具報在案，乃查各該稽征處猶未一致遵限具報，殊屬非是，爰特再行通令催報，以便彙編。</p>
<h3>紅棉畫廳今開業</h3>
<p>紅棉畫廳爲畫畫界田寄葦，洪庶安，魏友業，諸君所發起，以流通名人畫畫，推薦當代藝術作品爲宗旨，聞該廳畫畫一律均可退現，藉昭信實，該應地點即在紅棉酒家三樓，定於今日開業。</p>
<h3>福利局招募勞工</h3>
<p>本市社會福利局鑒於戰後工廠停閉，百業凋零，致失業工人，與時俱增，而另一方面因生產停頓，物資缺乏，欲謀增加生產，又需大批勞力，倘務失業工人，用於增加生產，實爲一舉兩得，爰特招募各種失業工人，予以適當工作，待遇相當優厚，實爲失業工人之福童，如有意者可自本月二日起，至下列各處報名：（一）北蘇州路四七〇號，（二）永康路二〇〇號，（三）蓬萊路二六七號。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>萬象更新行善最樂　認捐助學金勸募意義深長</h3>
<p>新年到了，與人相見，少不了祝頌一番「恭喜恭喜！」俗語說：「新年一到，萬象回春，」一切的一切，都要去舊迎新。以個人而言，過去種種，譬如昨日死；以後種種，譬如今日生。我們既有了送往迎來的心理，便該反省我的言行，檢討我的善惡，重新決定我的方針。如此說來，到了新年，每個人的責任，彷彿又加重了許多。在新的責任未完成以前，說不上快樂，回顧在兒重時代，以爲新年是快樂的，到了中年以後，便不以新年爲快樂了。那末人生最快樂究竟在什麽時候呢？「學校畢業，」「升官發財，」「新婚燕爾，」「事業成功，」這些不是最快樂的時候麼？我說這還不算數。一個人要「心地光明，」要「淸靜無爲，」要「利人利已，」所謂「爲善最樂，」纔是人生「最快樂的時候。」譬如說我今天雖有「高官厚祿，」而所作所爲，盡是「禍國殃民」的行爲，那就說不上「快樂，」倘使我今天做了一椿「利人利已」的事，而且於國於民極有意義的善事，那末心地裏發出了溫柔的徵笑，纔是千眞萬確的「快樂。」像本報爲助學金而發動的「特別勸募，」就是最好的「例證。」</p>

<h3>米糧配給制度之改善</h3>
<p>— 戚米</p>
<p>由於民食問題日趨嚴重，各方對於食米配給制度之改善，意見甚多，但最主要之意義，還在如何求以合理的公平的配給方法，我想主持當局，對於各方的建議，絕不「固執己見」吧麼！</p>
<p>（一）調查確實之戶口</p>
<p>爲求配給制度深刻化起見，人口調查的確實，是與認爲改善配給制度之第一要着，即以市區南市而論，過去若干戶口，只有遷進，而無移出，如此非特影響配給上之正確性，而更使當事者乘機舞弊中飽，因此爲健全物品配給制度起見，對於戶口進出，應作如下嚴格之規定。</p>
<p>一·如有遷入搬出生死等情，盡於一周內向保甲處報告，以清手續。</p>
<p>二·隨時施行臨時抽查，此項抽查辦法，可由保甲處菓同統配處隨時赴本市各保甲施行抽查，遇有　報或冒名頂替者，即取消其配給之資格。</p>
<p>三·報入戶口，如旅　他方者，槪以三月爲限，如超越此期，得暫時停止其配給權利。</p>
<p>四·嚴格監視保甲長，　使其從中作弊。</p>
<p>（二）軍警公務員</p>
<p>等食米配給之改革</p>
<p>在特別配給內，軍警公務員等食米配給，據去年糧食局統計，是爲佔全部配給中之十分之三。今後此項食米之供應，可由市政府負責配給，其基本來源，可援蘇省實物徵收辦法，由業主繳納實物，如此政府可從田賦方面獲得大量食米，如有不足，可在市塲收購若干，爲數有限，自不必影響到市府財政及妨碍農民再生產。如市府各縣以田畝八十萬畝計算，平均每畝徵米一升（蘇省一斗），則每縣可得六萬四千石，除市區爲非產米區域外，其下北橋·奉賢·嘉定……等地，可以徵收達四十八萬八千石，以此項徵購實物，如作爲軍警公務員等食配米，實綽乎有餘。</p>
<p>（三）配給量不足之改善</p>
<p>配給量之不足，已爲大家周知的事實，假定普通五口之家，最低限度每人每日食米五合，僅供中餐一飯，晚餐一粥而已，如此每月已需食米七斗五升，目下市區每旬每人配給平米二升，以五人計，每月共得三斗，雖每期有麵粉搭配，亦不過每句每人二斤每月共得配給三十斤，以每一斤半抵一升共抵食米二斗，核諸最低需要量，尚不足二斗，設不慣　糧，仍不得不仰給黑市米補給之，刻下上海黑市米價爲四萬數千元一擔，以上海市民一般的職業狀况，誰都擔負不起，如一家五口之家每月食米，就需萬元以上。因此我們的意見：</p>
<p>一，設法增加配給量：現在每人所可領到的戶口米，尚不敷每人需要之一半，姑以日本國內配給而論，每人每月有二四七，五兩，約合我國九升七合，比諸日下本市配給量，多出三升七合，以國人之食量，素比日人爲健，於情於理，配給當局對提高配給量，至少應與日本人相等，我們相信戶口米配量一俟增加，除可制止其他物價之漲風，而便利物價統制之推行。</p>
<p>二，額外配給普遍化：我們希望額外配給的普遍化，也可相當減少食糧問題的嚴重性。</p>
<p>三，增加雜糧配給：如食米不足，可增配雜糧，這總比白米中攙泥沙，合理得多，有益得多。</p>
<p>（四）重點配給之商榷</p>
<p>在不能足量不能準期的情形下，對於真正需要者，首須切實的攷慮，因此重點主義的配給，是目下真正合理的公平的配給方法，不過重點配給如何支配，我們的意見是：</p>
<p>一，以年齡而分：上海一隅，對於配給米糧，是不分年齡性別的，其實這種辦法，對於一個小孩子與老人或無多大差別，但在一個壯年，似覺不甚合理。日本自十一歲至六十歲其食米配給量，每人每日槪以三三〇克爲標準（等於中國人，二五兩），超越或不到此規定年齡，得酌量減少其配量，此項辦法，於我們食米不充裕的時候，是應有參攷的必要。</p>
<p>二，以勞力勞心而分：所謂勞心勞力，就是指從事生產事業的產業工人或教師公務員等，被等有功於國，若再令其爲衣食而急，豈非影響工作効率，所以日本特規定重勞働者，男人每日可得三九〇克，女子三五〇克，特別重勞働者男子每人每日可得五七〇克，女子可得四二〇克，國家優待彼等之食糧配給，　無論在個人需要上或報酬上，都是感到合理的。</p>
<p>三，以個人資力而分：在米價貴到四萬餘元的今日，富有階級是可不必以戶口米配給來維持生計的，因此對於一些富有階級的戶口米配給，應否減少其配量或是停止配給，當局應有縝密考慮的必要。其次，最近嘗聞取消富有階級奴僕的戶口米，此項辦法，是可先去實行的。據若干專家統計，上海一隅，如能停止富有階級的戶口米配給，則可省去全部戶米之六分之一，反之，以此六分之一增加於衣食不周的赤貧人士，豈非盡其配給之理想乎！我們希望取消有產階級的配給與增加赤貧者的配給，是懷有同一期望的。</p>
<p>四，以目前需用而分：在戰時體制下視爲不合需要的消耗品，是可隨時令其停止出品，以米　宗而論，酒，飴糖，米　，皆須以米製作，而此種東西，在國人習慣上，素以「閒食」見稱，自今以後，統配當局對於此等特別配給，亦正視其需用量，施以嚴格之規定，於必要時，可停止其配給。其次，對於飯館小飯店之食米配給，不妨酌予增加其配量，因小飯店者，恰恰似平民食堂，不過對於顧客之食量，不妨嚴予限制。</p>
<p>（五）米粉配給之協調</p>
<p>據最近一位視察產米區歸來的記者告筆者，在產米區各個統制機構（如油糧粉麥）各方多各自爲政，他們的漠不相關，影響工作效率至鉅，即在上海，也可見到。姑以本題而論，如配米脫期，那末戶口粉不妨跟上配給，如戶口粉配量過少，則戶口米可酌與增加，在在皆須爲民着想，不必僅以「應付」了事，所以在今後配給事務上，配米配粉應取相互之協調才是。</p>
<p>（六）配米資金之籌劃</p>
<p>配米一再脫期，配米一再增價，一面固在物資的缺乏，但另一方面，實由配給當局財力不足所致，因此作者希望在改善配給制度上，不要忽略了這根本的問題，意見如下：</p>
<p>一，本市各大銀團，可從大處着眼，籌劃配米貸款，其資金額，至少須以存米三個月爲標準（即九期戶口米），以上海市民三百五十萬而論（物品統配處發表），每人每月暫以六升計，則月需食米二十一萬石，今以收買價格五千元一石計，則需三十萬萬元，是項鉅款，如能集腋成裘，想來總有辦法的。</p>
<p>二，最近我們聽到市府將接受市政諮詢會之請，將發行市政公債十五萬萬元，預定以十萬萬元作爲調整米糧資金，而用以調整配給米價格，這辦法，在改善配米制度上，倒是一件無上的德政。我們不希望政府當局實施高價收進平價出售之補給制度，但我們認爲以此十萬萬元作爲維持配米，每石五千元價格之基金，是有其絕對的理言。</p>
<p>因此我們的希望：</p>
<p>第一辦法能全部做到，則以此項鉅款作爲配米資金之用，本市食米恐慌，將因一勞永逸可解決其根本。如第一辦法不能實行時，其第二辦法，對小民亦受益菲淺，如能以一·二兩法相輔而行，則尤佳。</p>

<h3>The National Government Has Determined to Hold a Celebration Ceremony This Morning on New Year's Day, Simultaneously Promulgating a Decree of Amnesty to Make a Fresh Start with the People</h3>
<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - The New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China has arrived. At this time of renewal, coinciding with the Greater East Asia War entering its decisive phase, the glorious future of the national liberation war has arrived with the spring sun. In order to welcome this day of great significance, the National Government has specifically scheduled a celebration ceremony for the New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the National Government. All civil and military officials of the various departments and commissions under the National Government will participate in the celebration. All participating officials will wear national ceremonial attire, or blue robes with black mandarin jackets, and decorations. Military officials will wear standard military uniforms, sabers, and decorations. The order of the celebration is recorded as follows: (1) Playing of music; (2) Heads of various departments and commissions enter the venue; (3) Chairman takes his seat; (4) All stand at attention; (5) Singing of the national anthem; (6) Bowing three times to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father; (7) Address by the Chairman; (8) Heads of various departments and commissions offer congratulations to the Chairman and bow once; (9) Heads of various departments and commissions bow to each other; (10) President Liang leads the cheers of "Long live the Republic of China" three times; (11) Playing of music; (12) End of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, at the beginning of the 34th year of the Republic of China, plans to make a fresh start with the people and promote renewal. In accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Organic Law of the National Government, he issued an explicit order to grant a general amnesty. The detailed articles and regulations have been carefully drafted by the various departments and commissions of the Executive Yuan. The government order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Order of the National Government (January 1st, 34th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>This is the 34th year since the founding of our Republic of China, and the 5th year since the return of our National Government to the capital. Alas, Heaven has not ceased its trials, and calamities follow one another. The flames of war have reached every corner, and the world is in turmoil. The late Chairman Wang, braving all difficulties, first led the way to peace and followed the path of co-prosperity with our allies, establishing a grand plan for our nation for centuries to come. In these five years, we have shared weal and woe with our neighbors, pacified the borders, and brought peace to the people. We have promoted education, built up the military, and encouraged commerce. All the major principles for governing the country and establishing prosperity have been implemented in order. However, his ambitions were not fulfilled, and he passed away prematurely. The present Acting Chairman reluctantly undertakes this difficult task and is constantly filled with apprehension. Recalling the past six years, the national vitality has not yet recovered, the people are suffering, the markets are in ruins, the granaries are desolate, and music has long ceased. As a result, studies have been neglected, laws have been disregarded, and wicked officials and treacherous people are terrified and act inappropriately. Considering the origins of these situations, we cannot help but sigh with sorrow. Some have been deceived by cunning enemies and gone astray, while others have acted rashly and fallen afoul of the law. Remembering the warnings of our predecessors against punishing those who have not been taught, and following the ancient principle of not punishing those who acknowledge their wrongdoing, except for those who are stubbornly wicked, we should show leniency and compassion. Therefore, following the benevolent spirit of the late Chairman Wang, we hereby issue a decree of general amnesty, hoping for the pervasive nurturing of spring and the season of plowing. Based on the provisions of Article 6 of the Organic Law of the National Government, we hereby grant a general amnesty and instruct the relevant departments and commissions to properly prepare the articles and regulations and respectfully carry out this task, in order to demonstrate the meaning of making a fresh start with the people and promoting renewal. All our countrymen should uphold this spirit, strive forward with determination, cultivate a loyal spirit to serve the country, cleanse themselves of past misdeeds, and temper the moral character of the nation, in order to welcome great fortune and promote great achievements. This is our sincere hope. This order is issued by Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo.</p>
<h3>Striving for Three Major Tasks to Fulfill the Mission of Revival - New Year's Address by Acting Chairman Chen</h3>
<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - The following is the New Year's address by Acting Chairman Chen for the 34th year of the Republic of China:</p>
<p>In the New Year's Day of last year (the 33rd year), the late Chairman Wang instructed us that after the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the enhancement of friendly relations between China and Japan has a brighter path, the alliance of the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia has a clearer principle, the victory of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War is more assured, and the independence of China and the liberation of East Asia are more reliably guaranteed. Facing this bright future, there is no need to hesitate or look back. Regarding the direction and steps for future progress, there is also no need to be unconventional. We only have to follow the established policies and strive further for the three major tasks of "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production." We must devote all our energy to the top priority of the decisive battle, in order to achieve the fulfillment of the goals of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity War and the active development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, thereby completing the dual mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.</p>
<p>Last year, the most unfortunate thing we felt was that after the late Chairman Wang pointed out the direction and steps for our progress, he fell ill and went to Japan on March 2nd for medical treatment. Unfortunately, he passed away on November 10th. For a year, we lacked leadership, and the achievements of the three major tasks he pointed out were not satisfactory. This is what we regret and feel very ashamed of. In the future, we must redouble our efforts to complete the three major tasks and enable China to truly gain freedom and liberation. When I assumed the position of Acting Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan on November 20th of last year, I stated that the policies set by Chairman Wang were all the policies I would implement, and the measures taken by Chairman Wang during his lifetime are all the measures I will take today.</p>
<p>Five Points Declared</p>
<p>Self-Encouragement and Encouragement of Others</p>
<p>Furthermore, I declare that, first, opposition to imperialism is the long-cherished aspiration of the National Government and the determination of the people of the whole country. Based on this determination, we will move forward courageously, regardless of success or failure. Second, we are determined to fulfill the late Chairman Wang's legacy and achieve the great aspiration that the Party must not be divided and the country must be unified, no matter how difficult it may be. Third, we are determined to purify the government, in accordance with the late Chairman Wang's instructions and the wishes of the people of the whole country, and strive for self-reliance. In the future, we will strive for national independence and freedom externally, and for national peace and unity internally. We will hold on to these two principles, carefully encourage ourselves, and encourage the people of the country.</p>
<p>Today, the country has entered the stage of decisive battle from a long period of war. Perhaps there will be a greater shortage of materials and greater hardship for the people, but the final victory will surely belong to the country that is firm and resolute. In order to achieve liberation and the true independence and freedom of the country, we need not only patience, but also unity and a clean government. Anyone who poisons the people or harms the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, must be punished. Fourth, it is undeniable that production has gradually stagnated today. In the future, we must attach equal importance to both military needs and civilian needs, in order to encourage the people to continue their efforts in production. Fifth, military affairs and politics must be coordinated. In the military, discipline and education should be emphasized. In politics, integrity should be valued and construction should be implemented. All of this requires not only perseverance, but also progress. This is the first thing we hope the people will understand.</p>
<p>Overall Peace</p>
<p>Full Effort</p>
<p>China is now beset by crises. If we do not work hard, we may become a battlefield for the decisive battle, or we may be completely communist, or we may become a colony of Britain and the United States again. If so, the achievements that the National Government has made in recent years in abolishing unequal treaties, recovering concessions, and abolishing extraterritoriality will all be ruined. Therefore, the people of the whole country should rise up in time to demand overall unified peace, unite the strength of the whole country to eradicate communism, eliminate the foreign forces of Britain and the United States in China, and implement the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, so that China can achieve freedom and independence. This is the second thing we hope the people will understand.</p>
<p>In short, China must be unified before it can achieve complete national independence, and only peace can achieve complete national freedom. Moreover, we must be firm and persevering in order to unite our efforts to achieve the future of the country and the people. With full effort, China can be revived and East Asia can be defended. This is what I sincerely hope for.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Koiso's New Year's Address - Striving for the Final Victory with Unified Effort</h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered the following New Year's address: At this New Year's of the fourth year of the Holy War, I respectfully wish His Majesty the Emperor boundless longevity. His Majesty, at the opening ceremony of the 86th Imperial Diet, bestowed an imperial rescript, saying: "Today, the war situation is becoming increasingly critical, and it is the time for hundreds of millions of people to unite and devote all their strength to destroy the enemy." We are truly honored and fearful, and the 100 million people will cooperate with each other and vow to die to destroy the enemy, break through the national crisis, and relieve the Emperor's anxiety. Now, the soldiers at the front line bear the great responsibility of annihilating the enemy, fighting bravely and resolutely. Especially on the Philippine front line, which determines the trend of the war, the special attack forces of the Japanese army and navy are launching courageous attacks day and night, sacrificing themselves for the country, and destroying the enemy's invasion attempts. The 100 million people in the rear should take this spirit as a lesson and express their noble spirit in their daily lives. Each should strengthen their combat power to the best of their ability, in order to destroy the enemy. This war has spread to the whole world, and all mankind is participating. Therefore, its scale and the complexity of international relations are unprecedented in history. In terms of victory or defeat, those who fight and lose their will to fight will eventually be defeated. Those who fight to the end with strong fighting spirit and strive to support the country will undoubtedly achieve final victory. As the war progresses, our daily lives become more difficult, and air raids will intensify. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the 100 million compatriots will strive to enrich their lives, strengthen their air defense posture, adhere to the determination to fight to the final victory, and increase production. This year is the final year of the war, and the government has taken all measures to fight for victory together with you. This year marks the 1300th anniversary of the Taika Reform in Japan. At that time, the internal and external situation in Japan was extremely difficult, and ominous clouds were spreading. However, due to the reform, the imperial power was proclaimed both internally and externally, and the original face of Japan was restored. Now, although the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been expelled, they have begun to counterattack, attempting to permanently place Greater East Asia under their control. Therefore, it is today's task to clear the ominous clouds of Greater East Asia and to ensure the permanent stability of the original state of Greater East Asia. We should, with this conviction, cooperate with the countries of Greater East Asia, defeat the enemy's counterattack, and fulfill our common mission.</p>
<h3>Madame Wang Donates Funds for Allied Nations to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - Madame Chen Bijun, member of the Central Committee and wife of the late Chairman Wang, deeply admired the recent bloody battles and repeated meritorious deeds of the Allied nations' land, sea, and air forces against the American forces in the Philippines, and was deeply impressed by the loyalty and bravery of the Allied forces. She specifically donated five million yuan a few days ago and personally delivered it to the headquarters of the Allied nations' dispatch army in China for the purpose of purchasing aircraft.</p>
<h3>General Commander Okamura's New Year's Day Address - Completing the Mission with Unwavering Faith</h3>
<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - General Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, delivered the following address on New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China: At the beginning of the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, all the officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Army respectfully wish long life to His Majesty and the prosperity of the Imperial fortunes. We are deeply moved and inspired. The purpose of the Holy War has been clearly stated in the Imperial Edict. The soldiers of the Expeditionary Army must, on both land and sea, crush the British and American ambitions to invade East Asia, and are still fighting to the death. This year is the year of decisive battle. We believe that our 100 million people will be able to uphold the Imperial Edict, regardless of the front or the rear, consolidate their determination to destroy the enemy, and promote the traditional spirit, dedicating themselves to the decisive battle in both material and spiritual terms, then victory will surely belong to us. On the Chinese front, last autumn, we completely annihilated the American air force bases in the southwest of China, a key area. Our strategic posture has been further strengthened, and preparations for the decisive battle are also being completed step by step. The Chongqing army is still gathered in a corner of the west, eking out a living, relying on American material assistance to continue the war of resistance, but it has no significant combat power. The American air force uses the inland as a base, either attempting to invade the Japanese mainland, or massacring innocent Chinese civilians, attempting to turn peaceful areas into scorched earth. However, the day when our army will strike a heavy blow against the enemy is near. All the officers and soldiers of our Expeditionary Army, at this New Year's, reaffirm their unwavering faith, thoroughly annihilate Britain and the United States, and accomplish the mission entrusted to us. Here, in addition to expressing our gratitude for the cooperation of the National Government since its participation in the war, we also wish for the consolidation of the National Government's foundation and the well-being of the 400 million people. Finally, we sincerely thank the support of the officials and people in our rear, and we earnestly hope that the Japanese residents in China will persevere, overcome all difficulties, and move forward.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Year's Dedication</h3>
<p>Today is the first day of the 34th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the 33rd year. We have already put forward many things that should be reflected upon for the past year. Today, based on yesterday's reflections, how should we start to do things in the coming year? We feel that fundamentally it is still nothing more than:</p>
<p>First, seeking thorough and clear politics,</p>
<p>Second, seeking the true establishment of security,</p>
<p>Third, seeking the substantial increase of production,</p>
<p>Fourth, seeking the appropriate stability of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point of clear politics, we believe that the four principles of political innovation proposed in this newspaper's article "Resolutely Strengthening Politics" on December 24th of last year can be used as a foundation, namely:</p>
<p>1. Strong governance,</p>
<p>2. Expert governance,</p>
<p>3. People-oriented politics,</p>
<p>4. Clean governance.</p>
<p>Only by establishing strong governance—with strict organization, sound institutions, and reasonable personnel—can various tasks be done well, government policies be implemented without obstruction, and cunning people be unable to manipulate and ruin things.</p>
<p>Only by establishing expert governance and achieving the right people in the right positions in politics can cooperation between officials and the people be seamless and the task of participating in the war be jointly practiced. Establishing representative bodies and giving the people the opportunity to participate in politics is very important.</p>
<p>Only by establishing clean governance, eradicating corruption, and eliminating extortion can official discipline be revitalized, political affairs be just and selfless, and national policies be implemented without obstruction. Therefore, severe penalties must be used to punish corruption and extortion.</p>
<p>At the same time, what we cannot ignore is that we are currently in the period of the Greater East Asia War, especially in the decisive stage. The life and death of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is tied to this decisive stage. Therefore, the most important mission of the government and the people this year is to work together to support the war. All efforts and all activities should, of course, take striving for military victory as the first priority. However, working together to support the war cannot be achieved solely by high-sounding slogans or written propaganda. The government must fully exert its power to lead the people and fully induce the power that the people should contribute, in order to assist the war and make a real contribution to striving for victory.</p>
<p>Therefore, to work together to support the war, political coordination must be done first. The government authorities should pay special attention to this principle. The so-called political coordination, the four basic points of which have already been put forward above, political clarity, is the revitalization and innovation of politics itself. Only with clear politics can we achieve security, increased production, and stable people's livelihood. Therefore, the first point is the soundness of politics itself, and the second, third, and fourth points are the good effects arising from sound politics. These four basic tasks are actually the important tasks of the government and the people this year. If they cannot be achieved, then it is a political failure, and there is no way to talk about working together to support the war.</p>
<p>In summary, we would like to put forward the slogan of "political competition" at the beginning of this year, which is the direction of work this year. What is the goal of political competition? It is the four basic points mentioned above. As for the specific methods of how to compete, we will not hesitate to express our humble opinions and will elaborate further.</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Attack Force Achieves Great Battle Results - Sinking Ten Enemy Ships in Two Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency - An enemy transport convoy, heavily damaged by fierce attacks by the Japanese air force, attempted to continue its northward advance from the Sulu Sea to reinforce Mindoro. On the 29th and 30th, it was attacked again by five squadrons of the Japanese special attack force. At 5:00 PM on the 29th, the Ichishin Flying Squadron first launched an attack, with one of its planes hitting an enemy transport ship advancing north in the Sulu Sea, causing it to catch fire and sink. On the same day, at midnight, three planes of an assault team attacked an enemy convoy near San Jose. One of them hit a transport ship, which immediately caught fire. The other two planes were unable to find their target in the darkness and returned safely to base. At 7:00 AM on the 30th, three planes of the Koka Squadron also sank one of the three enemy transport ships off the coast of San Jose, while the other two caught fire. On the same day, enemy warships appeared again near San Jose in the afternoon. There were 22 transport ships in the eastern sea and two large transport ships, five cruisers and destroyers in the southern sea. The five planes of the assault team immediately attacked them, causing two transport ships to catch fire in the western sea and one large transport ship to catch fire and sink three minutes later in the southern sea. The other two planes each sank two cruisers in the southern sea. In the two days of the special attack force's attack, excluding the four planes with unknown battle results, the remaining ten planes achieved the brilliant result of sinking ten enemy ships.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Tani Explains the Current Situation - China and Japan Should Jointly Fulfill Their Mission</h3>
<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency - Japanese Ambassador Tani delivered a speech on New Year's Day, explaining the current situation and expressing his belief in the adherence to moral cooperation between the two great nations of China and Japan to overcome the post-war chaos and hardship. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Expanding Relations</p>
<p>Survival Decisive Battle</p>
<p>The enemy America's counterattack, after the past year, has taken a serious form and is gradually approaching our mainland's defense line. At the same time, in Europe, our allied nation Germany is also welcoming the armies of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union near its homeland, launching a decisive battle related to the survival of the nation. On this New Year's Day of the 2605th year of the Imperial Era, I respectfully wish the Imperial State prosperity and face the national difficulties that have occurred before, and fight for the country to the death. Considering the ancient and modern history of Persia and Greece, Rome and Taiji, and the replacement of the decaying old order with the new order, all have gone through several pains. This is called the process of history, and the greater the future, the deeper the pain of production. Since China and Japan stood on their original footing and embarked on the path of morality two years ago, they have now entered a fierce battle situation. In this fierce war against Britain and America, China's provision of combat power and materials is an inevitable requirement. However, the so-called moral friendship of the policy towards China and the requirements of the war situation and materials are sometimes inevitably contradictory and mutually exclusive. However, history is a continuous creation that solves contradictions and unifies mutual exclusions, and now the moral history of the ideal of national construction has been unfolded. The current advancement of Japan has gradually liberated the various ethnic groups of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from the old British and American system.</p>
<p>Efforts</p>
<p>Strengthen Air Defense</p>
<p>Due to the progress of the war, daily life is becoming more difficult, and air raids are becoming more intensified. 100 million compatriots should conscientiously and clearly strive to make practical efforts to seek practical life, strengthen the air defense posture, and adhere to the determination to win victory, in order to increase production. I cannot help but earnestly hope that this year will be the year of the progress of the war. The government is also studying various measures for this purpose and hopes to move towards victory with all compatriots. This year is exactly 1,300 years since the Taika Reform. At that time, the internal and external situation was difficult and dangerous. However, once the state power was promoted internally and externally and the original face of the Imperial Country was restored, after the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been expelled, they have returned and began a counterattack to permanently enslave the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Therefore, this year is the year to clear the ominous clouds of Britain and America. Jin Ren must have this belief, share weal and woe with the countries of Greater East Asia, crush the enemy's attempt, and firmly grasp the common ideal of building Greater East Asia. On the part of Japan itself, appropriate measures have also been taken for compatriots in Korea and Taiwan to ensure that they will be treated equally with Japanese compatriots in the future and become true Japanese citizens. Japan must first correct itself and act as a righteous person in the spirit of morality, which will surely ignite the belief that thousands of people dare to be the first in the world.</p>
<p>British and American Exposure</p>
<p>Hegemony Purpose</p>
<p>On the contrary, considering what Britain and the United States have done in the past, we cannot help but feel deep gratitude and firm self-confidence. Their empty talk about freedom is insincere. Considering the facts of the Atlantic Charter, it is indeed the case. Especially the recent Greek civil unrest has fully exposed their purpose of dominating the world with imperialism, and they are not qualified to deal with European problems. The British and American troops claim to be liberators and protectors of freedom in the countries where they landed. But how do they behave in our country? Batriolo's rebellion did not save his country, and the French did not welcome de Gaulle. In Greece, armed conflict broke out with the liberating British troops. Therefore, tracing back to the Soviet Union's past overcoming the difficulties of being oppressed by the German army, demanding to be far away from its national territory, and in France, launching a fierce battle line and independently maintaining the eastern battle line, it is really incomprehensible why they automatically requested the British and American troops to land in their own country and conduct air guerrilla warfare on their own citizens' territory. Where does it belong? The enemies we are fighting are the British and American troops, which rely on their material strength, and the Chongqing personality, which has lost this national self-consciousness. The battle situation is now extremely fierce, but Britain and the United States still have a persistent will to fight. Their indiscriminate bombing of Hankou is expected to expand its scale and air raid various places. We must endure the bombing encountered by London, Hamburg, Berlin, and Moscow.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Nations</p>
<p>Moral Cooperation</p>
<p>On this New Year's Day, I firmly believe that the two great nations of Greater East Asia, China and Japan, will carry out moral cooperation, which is an indispensable foundation for completing the war, overcoming post-war chaos and hardship, and building Greater East Asia. Thinking back to today last year, the late Chairman Wang inherited the great cause of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and strongly stated that there is no independence or freedom without sacrifice. He vowed that the people of the two countries would live and die together. The two nations should overcome the difficulties before them and complete the common mission of the two countries. Their descendants should do their best in mutual respect. Finally, I would like to express my infinite gratitude to the heroic spirits of the two countries who sacrificed to complete this great cause and pray for the long-lasting martial luck of the Japanese soldiers fighting in various places.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships in San Jose Bay: More Than Half Destroyed by Heavy Bombardment; Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Supplementary War Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 31st: Regarding the previously announced war results of the air force's attack on the enemy reinforcement transport convoy off Mindoro Island, it is hereby further reported that five transport ships have been sunk and one cruiser has been destroyed.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Frontlines, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – According to a Japanese naval reconnaissance report on the situation in San Jose, Mindoro Island, on the 30th, three large transport ships were on fire near the mouth of San Jose Bay, seemingly on the verge of sinking. At the airfield south of San Jose, there were numerous small aircraft wreckage. Only six remaining aircraft were burning. This airfield housed more than twenty small aircraft, with several more patrolling overhead. The Japanese army's morning attack set two of these aircraft ablaze. Furthermore, about twenty transport ships and five warships were sighted in the sea south of San Jose, half of them docked and half seemingly having completed their mission and heading south through the waterway between San Jose and Mindoro. The enemy convoy, attempting to reinforce the San Jose base, has suffered losses estimated at one-third based on confirmed reports since the 28th due to continuous attacks by Japanese naval aircraft. Adding the war results of the Japanese attacking forces, the actual losses should exceed half. It is evident that this enemy reinforcement convoy has suffered substantial losses. Since landing in San Jose on the 15th, the enemy has attempted to reinforce the base, assembling fewer than a hundred fighter planes. Starting from the 22nd, they launched operations to suppress the northern Philippines, seeking coordination from Morotai to bomb key Japanese positions. However, due to the active attacks by the Japanese air force and naval vessels, their plans were completely thwarted since the 27th. Recently, even air raids on the northeastern Philippines have largely ceased.</p>
<h3>Enemy Air Raids on Haha-jima and Iwo Jima</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – On the night of the 29th, eight enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Iwo Jima several times.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – On the afternoon of the 29th, fifty enemy small aircraft attacked Halmahera Island.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – On the 29th, approximately sixty enemy aircraft, including B-25s and P-38s, attacked central Philippines. On the same day, a dozen or so B-24s attacked the southern region.</p>
<h3>Field Marshal Rundstedt: Message to the Troops, Strive for Victory with All Our Might</h3>
<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Huitong News Agency reports: General Rundstedt, Commander-in-Chief of the German forces on the Western Front, issued a New Year's message to the troops, stating briefly: The German army will intensify its efforts until the end. The spirit of the fallen soldiers will forever be our model. 1945 will show us as loyal and courageous soldiers of Führer Hitler, attacking with certainty of victory, defending with steadfastness, responding calmly to battle, and achieving victory on the battlefield. Our faith in Führer Hitler and the power of the people shall never waver.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of State to Visit London to Participate in Three-Foreign-Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – A Reuters reporter reports: London has not officially denied Washington's report that US Secretary of State Stettinius will visit England to meet with Foreign Secretary Eden. It is also said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may meet with Stettinius. London political circles believe that Stettinius may come to England soon.</p>
<h3>German Counteroffensive Has Achieved Its Goal: Frontline Soldiers Calmly Respond to Battle</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – German News Agency reports: A military correspondent for the "Essener National Zeitung" stated that the main goal of the German offensive on the Western Front, to overturn the enemy's plans and relieve the Aachen front, has been achieved. Anti-Axis sources claim that the German army has gained a temporal advantage, a special result of Field Marshal Rundstedt's strategy.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Huitong News Agency reports: In the winter battle in Belgium and Luxembourg, the German army continues to fight with a steadfast attitude, while the Eisenhower forces continue to pressure the northern and southern flanks of the German army. The American counterattack is becoming increasingly strong, seemingly intending to eliminate the source of the German vanguard. The German measures are transitional. A large number of American troops have been transferred from other lines. Half of the forces originally on the 700-kilometer front have been moved to the 50-kilometer war zone. German reports indicate that fifteen American divisions have been routed or annihilated.</p>
<h3>Fortress of Budapest Under Heavy Siege</h3>
<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Hai Society News: In the past twenty-four hours, the Hungarian-German allied forces defending Budapest have resisted the Soviet advance in the most intense fighting. The Soviets are currently attempting to enter the city from the north, but the majority have been destroyed by German automatic weapons. Although the remaining forces have made slight progress, they have only gained ruins and rubble. The fiercest fighting is currently taking place in the western part of the city. The Soviets have repeatedly reinforced their attacks, but have ultimately failed to seize strong German strongholds. Budapest is gradually becoming a fortress. Every step the Soviets take triggers mine explosions. German-Hungarian forces have set up rifles and machine guns at every narrow doorway in the underground, mowing down Soviet assault teams. German tanks and artillery positions are firing from concealed locations to block the Soviet advance. The defending forces also launch sudden night attacks, annihilating or repelling the Soviets.</p>
<h3>France Signs Anti-Axis Declaration</h3>
<p>Lisbon, December 31st, Central News Agency Telegram – Huitong News Agency reports from Washington: The French provisional government's ambassador to the United States will sign the Anti-Axis Declaration on New Year's Day, becoming the thirty-sixth signatory.</p>
<h3>Prospects of the Current Stage of the War (1): Roundtable Discussion Among the Heads of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry Press Sections in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To commemorate the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, the "Continental News" newspaper invited the heads of the Army Press Section, the China Fleet Press Section (Mr. Matsushima), and the Embassy Information Section (Mr. Matsudaira) in Shanghai to hold a roundtable discussion, each expressing their views on the future of the war. The record of the discussion is published in the Japanese-language "Continental" monthly magazine's New Year's issue, and is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Continental News: We are honored to have the guidance authorities for press and propaganda in Shanghai, the Army, Navy, and the heads of the Embassy Press Section, grace us with their presence! As the Greater East Asia War enters its fourth year, we would like to ask the three of you to discuss the current state of the war and the public's perception of it. We would like to invite Mr. Matsudaira, head of the Press Section, to speak first.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Not at all, not at all. Now, as desired by your esteemed company, let's begin the discussion. First, let's look at the current stage of the war and briefly review the situation since the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Matsushima, head of the Fleet Press Section, to talk about the progress of the Pacific operations.</p>
<p>Army-Navy Cooperation</p>
<p>With One Heart and One Mind</p>
<p>Matsushima: The past year has been the most intense year of counteroffensives by the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the United States, in the Pacific. Since the counteroffensive in the Gilbert Islands at the end of last year, they advanced into the Marshall Islands at the beginning of this year, and then invaded Truk in February. Before long, the tentacles of the enemy's Pacific general counteroffensive extended to the Mariana Islands. On the one hand, following the fierce attacks on Rabaul and the occupation of the Admiralty Islands, they emerged from Biak on the northern coast of New Guinea, and finally landed on Saipan in June. At this point, the war situation entered an extremely important decisive stage. Thus, MacArthur's Philippine invasion began approximately two months earlier than planned, opening with the attacks on Leyte and Peleliu on September 15th. The American Pacific Fleet, cooperating in this battle, also invaded the Ryukyu and Taiwan areas, marking the beginning of the decisive battle between Japan and the United States. This decisive period can be said to have come very early. Needless to say, the United States' extraordinary anxiety about the global war situation, especially the crisis in Chongqing and the situation within the United States, are all related. Due to these circumstances, the United States had to carry out a very risky and unprepared operation. As for Japan, we had long anticipated such a day and had been preparing for the decisive battle, considering the close relationship between the mainland operations and the Pacific operations. Regarding the mainland operations, please let Mr. Izubuchi explain in detail later. In the Pacific, around the time of the fall of Saipan, the strategic situation became slightly unfavorable. However, thanks to thorough preparation, we quickly maximized our warfighting capabilities and immediately reversed the unfavorable situation. Everything went smoothly, far exceeding our expectations. Not only did the enemy suffer severe blows of eight or ninety percent, but our own warfighting capabilities were further strengthened than before, putting the enemy in a very unfavorable situation. And this decisive battle has unfolded from this point onwards. Thanks to the divine power of the Emperor, after the great battles in the Taiwan and Philippine waters, we also achieved great results in the Battle of Leyte, inflicting deep blows on the main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet. Subsequently, in the fierce Battle of Leyte, we further shattered the enemy's American ambitions. Particularly, due to the courageous fighting of the Army and Navy air forces, as well as the suicidal attacks by special attack units and airborne troops, we fully demonstrated the essence of the Japanese spirit, striking terror into the hearts of the enemy. The development of the war has clearly been favorable to us. However, the enemy Americans are now resorting to any means to try to find a foothold in the Philippines in order to cut off the transportation arteries between the southern resource area and us, and further to land in China. Therefore, their greatly reduced naval and air power is colluding with the remnants of the Pacific Fleet, using transport ships, which still have surplus capacity in terms of quantity, to inject troops and materials into Leyte Island. And recent developments suggest that they may still be using some of their forces in other locations—according to local propaganda, on Luzon Island or elsewhere—to attempt landing operations. On the other hand, as you all know, of particular importance in relation to this is the strategic bombing of Japan from mainland China and the Mariana Islands. This, of course, contains political and ideological implications, and at the same time, they want to weaken our production capacity through this. Therefore, the future of the war can be divided into two aspects in the Pacific: the decisive battle in the Philippines surrounding Leyte Island, and, in response to this, the air war against the Japanese mainland from bases in Chengdu and the Mariana Islands. The decisive battle around Leyte Island is very advantageous to us in every aspect. This is unparalleled in all the battles in the Pacific thus far. Why? Because we largely control the sea and air, and our army's deployment on land is also very favorable. Consequently, we hold the initiative in operations. It is only the air raids launched by enemy aircraft flying from bases on the mainland and in the Mariana Islands against northern Kyushu and the vicinity of the capital that deserve attention, and we must take necessary measures.</p>
<p>One more point is the British ambitions. The war situation in Europe is currently at a stalemate, but due to the strength of the German navy, the British navy has considerable surplus capacity. Part of its forces has gradually been transferred from the Mediterranean or Africa to India and Australia. This is foreseeable, and there has also been recent intelligence to this effect. In addition, the British Eastern Fleet, based on Ceylon, seems to have some ambition recently, and part of it seems to have advanced, exiting the eastern coast of Australia and the Southwest Pacific war zone, i.e., the New Guinea area. At the same time, part of the so-called defeated fleets of France, Italy, and the Netherlands—whose strength is, of course, extremely small—is assisting MacArthur or Nimitz's offensives. This is also foreseeable. Therefore, under today's circumstances, although the enemy's offensive in the Indian Ocean is diversionary, it is on a certain scale.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the enemy is also coming from the north, but due to weather conditions, it is currently only a small number of aircraft or faster units such as destroyers carrying out mobile operations.</p>
<p>Under the above circumstances, the Navy is cooperating closely with the Army, with one heart and one mind, standing with the Chinese mainland behind us, and fighting on the Pacific front with the belief that we will surely destroy the enemy. At this time of renewal for all, we are determined to inflict a decisive blow on the enemy in the fourth year of the air war.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: As Mr. Matsushima said, the situation of the Pacific operations is very closely related to the operations on the mainland, and the enemy seems to be acting in accordance with this principle as well. Regarding this point, I would like to ask Mr. Izubuchi to give a comprehensive summary of the situation of the Army's activities on the mainland and in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Land War Results</p>
<p>Can Be Expected</p>
<p>Izubuchi: To summarize the mainland operations in the third year of the Greater East Asia War, it can be said that the color of the decisive battle against the United States became increasingly intense. In the Hunan-Henan operation that began in April of this year and the Guangxi operation that followed, the targets were clearly the enemy Americans. This is clear from the statement issued by the Japanese government less than immediately after the start of the operation, and the statements by the supreme commanders thereafter. The Japanese army's operation this time was to destroy the true enemy of East Asia, the United States, which had been secretly disrupting East Asia since the Sino-Japanese Incident, on the mainland. The United States' ambition on the mainland, needless to say, was to use the mainland as a base to bomb our mainland, cut off the connection between Japan and the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to bomb the Philippines and Taiwan. To achieve this ambition, the enemy Americans built a group of airbases on the mainland and instigated the Chongqing forces to resist the Japanese army. However, due to this large-scale offensive operation, all the airbases in southeastern and southwestern China were destroyed. Starting with the Changsha airfield, about twenty major enemy airbases, including Guilin, Liuzhou, Guiyang, and Nanning, are all under our control. The enemy American ambitions have therefore suffered a major blow. Furthermore, we broke through the provincial border of Guizhou and advanced into Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. On the one hand, we advanced from Nanning to link up with Vietnam, connecting with Saigon. As a result of this operation, the north and south of mainland China have been severed, splitting the Chongqing forces that assist the American forces into two, and also cutting off most of the resource area on which Chongqing relies, which is also what the United States relies on. Therefore, Chongqing must have suffered a significant blow in the political and economic aspects as a result of this battle. What makes this operation different from past operations on the mainland is the issue of air superiority regarding air power. In this mainland-spanning operation, we have been constantly hampered by superior enemy air power, causing various difficulties in the operation, especially in terms of supplies. We have experienced unprecedented difficulties. Water and land routes are virtually the same. We cannot move in broad daylight. In other words, it is a battle for supplies. This is the same in the Pacific operations. In short, there have been enormous tactical changes in the war on the mainland that have never existed before.</p>
<p>The same is true of the battle situation on Leyte Island in the Philippines. As far as we know, the enemy's strength is approximately eight divisions, or about 100,000 men. In contrast, after repeated reinforcements and the great victory of the Navy, we have overwhelmed the enemy everywhere. However, air superiority, which has a great impact on ground battles, is being fiercely contested by both sides' air forces. Recently, due to the active roles of the Army and Navy special attack units and suicide squads, the enemy airfield has been destroyed, and the enemy American air power has suffered great damage. We can expect the future battle results.</p>

<h3>Minister Tsuchida Delivers New Year's Address: Devote All Efforts to the Decisive Battle to Destroy the Stubborn Enemy</h3>
<p>Mr. Tsuchida, the Japanese Minister Plenipotentiary to Shanghai, issued the following New Year's address:</p>
<p>As we welcome the 605th year of the Imperial Era, I first pay my respects to His Majesty the Emperor and express my heartfelt gratitude to the soldiers of the Army and Navy for their valiant and arduous fighting. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, we have now entered the fourth year. On this auspicious New Year's Day, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States is unfolding, centered on the Philippines. The enemy, having suffered a crushing defeat in the Philippine Sea, must now be recognized as having prepared a considerably strong counteroffensive. The battles of Leyte and Mindoro demonstrate the enemy's intention to counterattack. However, the eternally loyal Imperial Army and Navy, with special attack units as the vanguard, are engaging in total suicide attacks to annihilate the enemy, who relies on material strength. To achieve victory in the war, we must continue this death struggle. The great spirit of defending the Philippines, our imperial homeland, and preserving our national polity is a manifestation of the essence of our 3,000-year history of nation-building. The 100 million people are moved to tears, and the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia praise in unison. In view of the spirit of certain death displayed in the Philippine decisive battle, with free special attack units as the vanguard, leading the way to victory, the 100 million people should quickly rise up as the backup of the special attack units, devote all their efforts to the decisive battle, overcome all difficulties, and fully embrace wartime conditions. In order to secure China's commitment to the war, all must act with broad-mindedness and implement wartime action completely, to deepen the trust of the Chinese people, and the Chinese and Japanese peoples will join hands and work toward completing the Greater East Asia War. As we face the beginning of Showa 20, the year of the decisive battle, I shout three times "Long live the Imperial Nation!" and reiterate my determination to destroy our archenemy, so as to respond to the imperial will. This is my sincere hope.</p>

Looking back on the past year, the momentum of the Anglo-American counteroffensive has become increasingly fierce. Since October, the situation has suddenly entered the decisive battle stage, and a fierce battle is currently unfolding, centered on the Philippines. This year will determine the final outcome of the Greater East Asia War, and we must recognize the great significance of this year. For three years of the Holy War, with the ironclad unity of the entire nation and the cooperation of our allied nations bound by a vow to live and die together, we have destroyed the enemy's warfighting capabilities and maintained an undefeated record in both political and military warfare, forever shining in the annals of history and illuminating the world. The billion people of Greater East Asia are breaking through all difficulties and advancing bravely under the ideal of co-prosperity. The enemy's counteroffensive cannot be ignored, and although there are many contradictions and weaknesses hidden within their country, their ambition to seize world hegemony is detestable. But today, they are arrogantly launching heavy counterattacks relying on their superior material strength, exposing their final desperate state. It is especially important to note that the people must not be negligent in the slightest degree amidst their great enthusiasm. At this opportune time, the China Fleet and the China Expeditionary Army, under close and rapid coordination, will fight unexpectedly and preemptively in a situation where the mainland and the Pacific are shaped into a decisive ring, in order to complete the objectives of the operation. The soldiers are protecting the country with utmost loyalty and fulfilling the great righteous cause. As the war situation develops, the position of the mainland front is becoming increasingly serious. The greatest power must be demonstrated on the three fronts of land, sea, and air, and at the same time, the political and economic mission of the mainland must also be established. I believe that in this decisive battle, we will surely subdue the British and Americans. The recent counteroffensive by the German army on the Western European front is invincible and can serve as an example for us. We should base our efforts on the fighting spirit of the Army and Navy special attack units to demonstrate the spirit of courage of the 100 million people. The war depends on the turning point, and the decision of victory or defeat lies in the most difficult time of the fierce battle between the two armies. At this time, if we can gain even an inch of ground over the enemy, we will be crowned with the glory of victory. There are clear examples of this from ancient times to the present. Therefore, we must maintain unwavering faith, deal with the current difficult situation, and make desperate efforts. The opportunity for victory will be grasped.</p>
<h3>Recent Weekly Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions in the City: General Situation Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and market conditions in Shanghai have been stable in the past week. Silver and Chinese stocks have not seen any major fluctuations, likely due to the year-end settlement of the national calendar year. Banks and money changers have tightened their mortgage lending practices, and the flow of funds has been stagnant. The authorities' crackdown on speculation and close surveillance have prevented market manipulators from operating, resulting in quiet trading. The markets were closed for the second half of the week, and the public was relaxed. Although the Ministry of Finance is strictly enforcing the strengthening of financial institutions and operations, it is absolutely committed to protecting legitimate and legal operations, so the entire financial system is solid and stable. On the industrial and commercial front, production has been unable to increase due to electricity restrictions, and the adjustment of material supply and demand has not been balanced. Although the price increase has been slightly suppressed, the future is uncertain. Those holding edible goods are still reluctant to reduce prices and sell. The general public hopes that the authorities will quickly find ways to smooth the flow of raw materials and restore production, and that there will be thorough and effective measures to suppress speculation and hoarding in order to reassure the people.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Investigate and Collect Taxes</h3>
<p>Since Luo Guangxu took over as Director of the Shanghai Income Tax Bureau, he has been actively promoting tax affairs, and tax revenues have been extremely strong. Most businesses have already paid their taxes, but there are a few businesses that have failed to pay. In order to universally urge collection and cultivate the habit of businesses paying taxes voluntarily, the bureau has decided to dispatch a large number of investigators from January 4th, dividing them into fifteen groups, each led by a tax police officer, to investigate door-to-door in each district and on each road. If businesses are found to have not paid their taxes, they will be ordered to fill out a declaration form on the spot. If there is resistance, they will be ordered to cease operations as a warning in accordance with the regulations. It is expected that the investigation will be completed within one month, in order to strengthen tax administration.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Urges Reporting: Estimated Income for Next Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau, urgently preparing the estimated revenue for all types of taxes in the city for the thirty-fourth year, had already issued orders to its subordinate district revenue offices, limiting them to reporting within seven days. However, it has been found that the respective revenue offices have not uniformly complied with the deadline, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, a further circular has been issued to urge reporting, so as to compile the overall estimate.</p>
<h3>Red Cotton Painting Gallery Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Red Cotton Painting Gallery is initiated by figures in the painting world such as Tian Jiwei, Hong Shuan, Wei Youye, with the purpose of circulating paintings by famous artists and recommending contemporary artistic works. It is said that all paintings in the gallery can be returned for cash, demonstrating integrity. The location is on the third floor of the Red Cotton Restaurant, and it is scheduled to open today.</p>
<h3>Welfare Bureau Recruits Laborers</h3>
<p>In view of the post-war factory closures and economic decline in the city, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed workers, and on the other hand, due to production stagnation and material shortages, there is a need for a large amount of labor to increase production. Employing unemployed workers for production is a win-win situation. Therefore, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau is recruiting various unemployed workers, providing them with appropriate work and relatively generous treatment, which is truly a blessing for unemployed workers. Those interested can register from the 2nd of this month at the following locations: (1) 470 North Suzhou Road, (2) 200 Yongkang Road, (3) 267 Penglai Road.</p>

<h3>Everything is Renewed, Doing Good is Most Joyful: Recognizing and Donating to Student Aid is of Profound Significance</h3>
<p>The New Year has arrived, and when you meet people, you can't help but offer blessings of "Congratulations, congratulations!" As the saying goes, "Once the New Year arrives, everything returns to spring." Everything must be renewed and welcome the new. From a personal point of view, the past is like yesterday's death; the future is like today's birth. Now that we have the psychology of sending off the old and welcoming the new, we should reflect on our words and deeds, examine our good and evil, and re-determine our direction. In this sense, the responsibility of each person seems to be much heavier when the New Year arrives. Before the new responsibilities are fulfilled, there is no happiness to speak of. Looking back at the era when I was a child, I thought that the New Year was happy, but after middle age, I no longer think that the New Year is happy. So when is the happiest time in life? "Graduation from school," "promotion and wealth," "newly married bliss," "career success"—aren't these the happiest times? I say it doesn't count. A person must have a "bright heart," must be "pure and inactive," must "benefit oneself and others," and the so-called "doing good is the most joyful" is the "happiest time" in life. For example, even if I have "high position and generous salary" today, but what I do is all "harming the country and hurting the people," then there is no "happiness" to speak of. If I do something today that "benefits oneself and others," and it is a good deed that is very meaningful to the country and the people, then the gentle smile from the heart is the absolutely true "happiness." For example, the "special fundraising" initiated by this newspaper for student aid is the best "example."</p>
<p>Teachers' Long Live Student Aid Movement</p>
<p>A letter from Chengyi Middle School states: "Respectfully, the expenses of your newspaper for one semester of student aid are quite large, and the donations received a few days ago are far from the difference, which makes me regret for how many young people lose the opportunity to study! Our colleagues in the education community originally belonged to a poor life, but we always embrace the joy of cultivating talents. Seeing this situation, how can we not be moved? My colleagues in the school value this New Year and specially initiated the "Teachers Long Live" student aid movement. Each person donates 100 yuan for every ten years of age, in order to extend the celebration of the new year and wish for longevity and help education. Although it is a small amount, I hope to arouse the response of my colleagues in the education community to express our love for our students. I now offer 20,000 yuan and hope to receive it."</p>
<p>Another letter from Ma Renzhu, the principal of Lizhi Middle School, states: "Respectfully, Mr. Lu Zhizhe, a math teacher in the high school of our school, because he realized the suffering of poor students who lost the opportunity to study, specially raised 25,000 yuan from the high school students and named it "Lizhi Middle School High School Team" to respond to your newspaper's enthusiastic spirit of helping students. A small token of appreciation, I will send it with the cash, please check."</p>
<p>Sino-German Students Fundraising for Aid</p>
<p>A letter from the students of the Sino-German Midwifery School who received aid states: "Respectfully, recently prices have soared, everything is expensive, and tuition fees in various schools will inevitably increase. It is not easy for people in the salaried class to have enough to eat, let alone take care of their children's education. Seeing this situation, I can't help but sigh! We are students who have received aid from your newspaper, and we dare to imitate Wu Xun's method of begging to seek help from major philanthropists. We have raised 22,500 yuan, which will be used as the "First Team." We will continue to raise funds in the future, and when we have a certain amount, we will pay it again to fulfill our duty as a citizen."</p>
<p>Ballad Storytelling for Student Aid Charity Performance</p>
<p>A letter from Tongfu Bookstore states: "Respectfully, our store is scheduled to open today (New Year's Day), and we have specially hired famous male and female ballad storytellers from Puyu Society. In order to respond to student aid, the daily performance today will be changed to a ballad storytelling charity performance. All ticket income (excluding expenses) and charity singing will be donated to help education. Welcome to donate for songs. The ticket price is 80 yuan per person, and a Bayer monthly calendar will be given as a gift with the tea donation. All proceeds will be donated to the Shen Xin newspapers' student aid fund. I hope people from all walks of life will come together to support this charitable cause. Liang Cheng Company manages Tongfu Bookstore, address 243 Tongfu Road."</p>

<p>Team 177: Staff of Huafeng Foreign Firm 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 178: Rice Association Team 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 179: Wuzhou Team (Fundraised by Xiang Shengwu) 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 180: Second Team of Student Fundraising at Minli Middle School 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 181: High School Team of Lizhi Middle School 25,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 182: Fourth Team of Huxin Middle School (Fundraised by Class 2C) 32,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 183: Fundraising Team of Sino-German Midwifery School Students 22,500 yuan</p>
<p>Team 184: Sheng You Team 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 409,500 yuan</p>
<p>Grand Total: 6,725,228 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, all the faculty and staff of "Chengyi Middle School" sent a letter to donate the "Teachers Long Live Team." The method is to donate 100 yuan for every ten years of age of the teachers in the school. If the total is 2,000 years old, they can donate a team of 20,000 yuan. Its intention and method are excellent. If the total age of all teachers in secondary and above schools in Shanghai is more than one million years, then it is not difficult to raise 10 million yuan in aid. However, our intention is not to accept the hard-earned money of the teachers, but to hope that the teachers will solicit donations from wealthy people outside the school or wealthy students and parents within the school, which would be the best method. Mr. Chengyou has donated a large amount to our newspaper's student aid fund in the past. Yesterday, he sent another 200,000 yuan to donate a team. His heart is commendable. The staff of Huafeng Foreign Firm, Rice Association, Wuzhou, each organized nine teams, and Minli Lizhi Huxin middle school students enthusiastically raised funds. Thank you on behalf of the students who received aid.</p>
<h3>Song for Being a Good Person</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>Get up at dawn, writing and calculating are the most important. Be serious about uniting industries and doing things. Be cautious when speaking when going out. Eat breakfast early, eat lunch fully, eat dinner sparingly. Be diligent and endure hardship, and avoid the three urgent illnesses (rushing on the road, rushing to speak, rushing to eat) to live a long and healthy life. Be filial to parents, respect elders, brothers and sisters are harmonious, daughters-in-law and sisters-in-law are close, relatives and friends are sincere and trustworthy. Raise children into adults, and strictly discipline their character. It is appropriate to work, study, farm, or do business. Don't admire vanity or be alarmed by false fame, or rely on constant wealth without seeking a career, which will harm your descendants. Accumulating virtue is deeper than accumulating wealth. Choose a son-in-law and marry a daughter with emphasis on morality. The family hopes for peace and everything will prosper. Eliminate the custom of fighting for wealth and gifts. (Give a new marriage couplet: A virtuous couple starts with mutual respect and love, and a good family comes from diligence and thrift) Prostitution, gambling, smoking, drinking, and greed for eating will lead to ruin and self-destruction. Be humble and tolerant in dealing with things, and don't be jealous. The sky is wide, the earth is broad, and Buddha is fair. Ethics and righteousness, matters and emotions, physics and literature, the six principles are prepared so that there are no regrets. Often read family instructions and the Five Classics to cultivate oneself and improve customs day by day.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Rice Rationing System</h3>
<p>— Qi Mi</p>
<p>As the problem of people's food is becoming increasingly serious, there are many opinions from all parties on the improvement of the rice rationing system, but the most important meaning is still how to seek a reasonable and fair rationing method. I think the authorities in charge will never "persist in their own opinions"!</p>
<p>(1) Conducting an Accurate Census</p>
<p>In order to deepen the rationing system, conducting an accurate population census is considered the first important step to improving the rationing system. Taking the Nanshi district of the urban area as an example, in the past, there were only people moving in and no people moving out. This not only affects the accuracy of the rationing, but also allows those involved to take the opportunity to embezzle. Therefore, in order to improve the sound rationing system, the following strict regulations should be made for the entry and exit of the population.</p>
<p>1. If there are situations such as moving in, moving out, or death, report to the Baojia within one week to complete the procedures.</p>
<p>2. Conduct temporary spot checks at any time. This spot check method can be carried out by the Baojia office and the Unified Distribution Office to conduct spot checks on each Baojia in the city at any time. Those who falsely report or impersonate will be disqualified from rationing.</p>
<p>3. Those who register as residents, such as those who travel elsewhere, are generally limited to three months. If this period is exceeded, their rationing rights may be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>4. Strictly supervise the Baojia heads to prevent them from cheating.</p>
<p>(2) Reform of Rice Rationing for Military Police and Civil Servants</p>
<p>Among the special rations, rice rations for military police and civil servants accounted for 30% of all rations, according to the statistics of the Food Bureau last year. In the future, the supply of this rice can be rationed by the municipal government. The basic source can be drawn from the Jiangsu Province in-kind collection method, with the owners paying in-kind. In this way, the government can obtain a large amount of rice from the land tax. If there is not enough, some can be purchased on the market. The amount is limited and will naturally not affect the financial situation of the municipal government or hinder farmers from re-producing. If the municipal government and its counties are calculated with 800,000 mu of cultivated land, and an average of one sheng of rice (one dou in Jiangsu Province) is collected per mu, each county can obtain 64,000 shi. Except for the urban area, which is a non-rice-producing area, the following areas, such as North Bridge, Fengxian, and Jiading, can collect up to 488,000 shi. Using this in-kind purchase as rice for military police and civil servants is more than enough.</p>
<p>(3) Improvement of Insufficient Rationing</p>
<p>The insufficiency of the rationed amount is a well-known fact. Assuming an ordinary family of five, the minimum requirement is five he of rice per person per day, which is only enough for one meal for lunch and one bowl of porridge for dinner. In this way, 7.5 dou of rice are needed every month. At present, each person in the urban area is rationed 2 sheng of rice every ten days. Calculated with five people, a total of 3 dou are obtained per month. Although there is flour to match each period, it is only 2 jin per person every sentence, and a total of 30 jin are rationed per month. At 1.5 jin per sheng, it is equivalent to 2 dou of rice. Compared to the minimum required amount, it is still short of 2 dou. If you are not used to miscellaneous grains, you still have to rely on black market rice to supplement it. At present, the price of black market rice in Shanghai is tens of thousands of yuan per dan. With the general employment status of Shanghai citizens, no one can afford it. For example, a family of five needs more than ten thousand yuan per month for rice. Therefore, our opinions are:</p>
<p>1. Find ways to increase the rationed amount: The household rice that each person can currently receive is not even half of what each person needs. Taking the domestic rationing in Japan as an example, each person has 247.5 liang per month, which is about 9.7 he in our country, which is 3.7 he more than the current rationing amount in the city. Since the Chinese people's appetite is inherently healthier than the Japanese, it is reasonable to require the rationing authorities to increase the rationing amount to at least the same as the Japanese. We believe that once the household rice rationing is increased, it will not only curb the rising prices of other commodities, but also facilitate the implementation of price control.</p>
<p>2. Universalize extra rationing: We hope that the universalization of extra rationing can also significantly reduce the severity of the food problem.</p>
<p>3. Increase the rationing of miscellaneous grains: If there is not enough rice, you can increase the rationing of miscellaneous grains. This is much more reasonable and beneficial than mixing mud and sand in white rice.</p>
<p>(4) Discussion of Focused Rationing</p>
<p>In the case of insufficient and untimely rationing, it is necessary to carefully consider those who really need it. Therefore, focused rationing is the most reasonable and fair rationing method at present. However, our opinion on how to allocate focused rationing is:</p>
<p>1. By age: In Shanghai, the rationing of rice does not distinguish between age and gender. In fact, this method is not much different for a child and an old person, but it seems unreasonable for a strong adult. In Japan, the rice rationing amount for people from 11 to 60 years old is generally 330 grams per person per day (equal to 2.5 liang for Chinese people). If you exceed or do not reach this prescribed age, you should reduce the amount of rationing accordingly. This method is necessary for our reference when rice is not abundant.</p>
<p>2. By labor and mental effort: So-called labor and mental effort refers to industrial workers, teachers, civil servants, etc. who are engaged in production. They are contributing to the country. If they are made to worry about food and clothing, it will affect work efficiency. Therefore, Japan specifically stipulates that heavy laborers can get 390 grams per day for men and 350 grams for women. Special heavy laborers can get 570 grams per day for men and 420 grams for women. The country gives preferential treatment to their food rationing, and it feels reasonable both in terms of personal needs and remuneration.</p>
<p>3. By personal wealth: At a time when rice prices are as high as 40,000 yuan, wealthy people do not necessarily need to rely on household rice rationing to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities should carefully consider whether to reduce or stop the household rice rationing for some wealthy classes. Secondly, I have recently heard that the household rice for the servants of the wealthy class will be cancelled. This method can be implemented first. According to the statistics of some experts, if the household rice rationing for the wealthy class can be stopped in Shanghai, it can save one-sixth of all household rice. On the contrary, if this one-sixth is increased to the impoverished people who lack food and clothing, wouldn't it be the ideal of rationing! We hope that canceling the rationing for the propertied class and increasing the rationing for the extremely poor have the same expectations.</p>
<p>4. By current needs: Consumables that are deemed unnecessary under the wartime system can be stopped from being produced at any time. Taking rice as an example, wine, candied fruit, and rice cakes all need to be made with rice, and these things are usually known as "snacks" in the habits of the Chinese people. From now on, the unified distribution authorities should also pay attention to the amount of these special rations and impose strict regulations. When necessary, the rationing can be stopped. Secondly, it may be appropriate to increase the rice rationing for restaurants and small hotels, because small hotels are just like public canteens, but the amount of food for customers may be strictly limited.</p>
<p>(5) Coordination of Rice Flour Rationing</p>
<p>According to a reporter who recently returned from inspecting the rice-producing areas, various control institutions in the rice-producing areas (such as oil, grain, flour, and wheat) mostly acted on their own. Their indifference greatly affected work efficiency, which can also be seen in Shanghai. Taking this topic as an example, if the rice is rationed late, then the household flour may as well follow the rationing. If the amount of household flour is too small, then the household rice can be appropriately increased. Everything must be considered for the people and not just "deal with" it. Therefore, in future rationing affairs, rice rationing and flour rationing should take mutual coordination.</p>
<p>(6) Planning of Rice Rationing Funds</p>
<p>Rice rationing is delayed again and again, and rice rationing is increasing in price again and again. On the one hand, it is due to the lack of materials, but on the other hand, it is due to the insufficient financial resources of the rationing authorities. Therefore, the author hopes that this fundamental problem will not be ignored in improving the rationing system. The opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The major banking groups in the city can take a broad view and plan for rice rationing loans. The amount of funds must be based on the standard of storing rice for three months (ie, nine periods of household rice). Taking Shanghai's 3.5 million citizens as an example (published by the Unified Distribution Office), each person temporarily needs 6 sheng per month, then 210,000 shi of rice are needed per month. Now, calculated at the purchase price of 5,000 yuan per shi, 300 million yuan are needed. If this huge amount of money can be gathered from small contributions, I think there will always be a way.</p>
<p>2. Recently, we heard that the municipal government will accept the request of the Municipal Advisory Council and will issue 150 million yuan of municipal bonds, of which 100 million yuan is planned to be used as funds to adjust rice prices and to adjust the price of rationed rice. This method is a great merit in improving the rice rationing system. We do not hope that the government authorities will implement a subsidy system of buying in at high prices and selling at low prices, but we believe that using this 100 million yuan as a fund to maintain the price of rationed rice at 5,000 yuan per shi is absolutely reasonable.</p>
<p>Therefore, our hopes are:</p>
<p>If the first method can be fully implemented, then using this huge amount of money as rice rationing funds, the rice panic in the city will be resolved once and for all. If the first method cannot be implemented, the second method will also benefit the people. It would be better if the two methods can be implemented in conjunction with each other.</p>
<p>(This newspaper recently solicited opinions on the rice rationing issue and selected ten names. The first name is published above.)</p>
