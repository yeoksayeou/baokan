<h3 id="c2">陳代主席訓辭　宣示三項國策　爭取國家獨立自由 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　陳代主席在蚌徐商汴四地檢閱靑少年，均有剴切訓話，本文爲綜合記錄稿，中央社記者謹誌（陳代主席檢閱皖淮豫軍隊訓詞）本人此次到蚌·徐商，汴。視察，能與諸位見面，感覺非常快慰。沿途所經各地，見地方各種建設，均充滿新氣象，這都是地方負責長官領導有方，全省軍官民努力的結果。現在又看到各位官的精神奮發，步伐整齊，更感到無上的安慰，深信中央對地方已付託有人。</p>
<p>本人此次視察各地目的有二：第一，現在時局緊張，千鈞一髮之際，各地一般軍政設施，是否能和時局需要相吻合，此點實爲重要，所以我要親到各地視察，藉明眞相。同時本人深知各位在地方工作，因環境的複推與艱難，備警不少辛勞，藉此機會，得與各位見面，特代表中央對各位表示慰勞之意。第二，是宣示中央意旨，明白的告訴大家，中央的政策無論時局如何緊迫，決不變更，中央的政策是付麼？簡單的說·便是「和平反共建國」，也就是　汪故主席於還都之際所手定的國策。吾人以和平爭取國家的自由，以反共實現國家的統一，以建國鞏固國家的獨立，不管時局如何緊迫，中央繼承　汪故主席的遺志繼續努力，現在固不變更，即將來也不變更。</p>
<p>希望軍民努三力點</p>
<p>除了以上雨點以外，我還想告訴各位，並員希望大家努力的有以下三爭問題，中國的參戰是自動的，不獨是爭取中國的獨立自由，而且是遵奉國父的遺教。因爲近百年來，在蘇彝士運河以東亞洲方面，除去日本是一個獨立國家以外，泰國雖然名日獨立，其實遭歐美箝制，僅維持半獨立狀態。其餘如印度·安南·緬甸·菲律賓·馬來·蘇門答臘，爪哇各地，都已做了英美的殖民的，我們中國更是渝入次殖民地的地位。我們要爭取自己國家的獨立自由，必定要聯合弱小民族共同奮鬥。單做到中國自由獨立，還是不夠的，必要全東亞民族都得到了解放，才可以保障吾們的獨立自由。吾人試觀規在歐戰似乎結束了，但各位要　得這是英美的眞正勝利嗎？絕不是的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c3">合理解決民食問題 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>關於民食問提，我們屢就所見論列，並向有關當局作積極的建議。自從當局實施緊急措置後，我們更建議緊接著實施第二步主要工作，就是以全力抑平米價，因為緊急措置是手段，抑平米價才是目的。米價抑平以後，更進一步以期合理解決民食問題。否則，一時下跌或緩和的米價，難以持久。我們所謂第二步措置，包括以下三要點：</p>
<p>第一，民食問題，決不是一個突然而來的問題，它有因，勢將不可避免的影響到今後民食問題。爲着合理解決起見，我們不侵耍顧目前，至少還聽顧到今後的一年。因此，我們認爲在今年秋收以前，必須預先籌定最妥善的解決辦法，應集合各方面的意見和力量，共同推進。關於今後最主耍的收買方式，各方而的意見，固然未能完全一致，但是無論如何，爲着合理解決民食問題，爲着完遂大東亞戰爭的共同目的，就非由中日雙方當局及中國民間三方面密切協力不可；缺少任何一方面都不能圓滿成功。所以，在秋收以前，我們必須集中三方面的意见和力量，籌謀全面的妥善辦法。</p>
<p>第二，就本市目前的民食問題而論，單是緊急措施還是不够，必須接着這緊急措施之後，採取保障這個措施充分奏效的辦法，否則，問題也會再度嚴重起來。我們這裹所謂保障緊急措施充分奏效的辦法，就是耍保障食米來源的暢達。說到這一層，單靠本市的糧商是沒有辦法的。因爲，今日要說保障食米來源暢達，第一需要相當充分的資金成本，第二需要有相當充分的運輸工具，第三要有力量避免沿途種種阻碍。要這三方面都有辦法，決不是目前的糧商所能爲力的。所以，也需要中日當局及中國民間三方面共同協力，才能辦到保障食米來源暢達這一個共局要求。而主要的還在由市政府支持，或由民間組織在中日變方當局協力之下與現有比較健全的糧食統制機構合作進行不可。</p>
<p>第三，目前還有許多阻碍本市民食合理解決的種種因素，如因前述來源暢達一點辦不到，當局的緊急措施有失去效用的可能。另一方面，最大多數可民，正渡雙重的壓迫。因爲糧商都需現款，不收信用通貨的撥款單及本票，結果普通市民乃受雙重壓迫而仍不得不以最高代價購取食糧。本報最近收到各界市民來函申訴這一方面痛苦的信，無慮千百。例如有一位某君來函，他是一個某大百貨公司的職員，家有老少入口，並無恒產，除了他自己一餐午飯吃了公司的，每月所賺薪津祇六萬餘元，本月收入只够買米一斗。而公司一律簽發支票，換取了的只是撥款單，更須打了折扣換得現鈔，否則就買不到雜糧菜蔬及日用品。全家一天吃爾頓稀粥尚難維持。又如文化人莫君來函，好客易借到一紙二十萬元的支票，又好容易換到了撥款翠，他親自跑到周家橋去買米，以期可以便宜些，但是誰也不收撥款單，又是千方百計，才算以八折貼現兌到現款。結果二十萬元的借款，只買得二斗米，找回了四千元現鈔！現在一般市民都在這種不合理的情形之下，忍受着不必要的苦痛。所以，這種實際上阻碍民食問題之解決的種種關係，我們也希望有關當局迅謀解決。具體的說，就是：　嚴禁妨礙米源暢通的任何行爲。　澈底執行限制銀行開具撥款單，及有效取締貼現惡風。　各公私機關發給薪津，儘量以現鈔發給，否則至少在十萬元以下不用支票發給。</p>
<p>總之，在這決戰階段，大家應該放棄小我暴利，顧全大局，不能讓最大多數民衆忍受不必要的痛苦，而減少決戰中的總力。</p>

<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日本政府値此本土行將化爲戰塲之緊張情勢，爲期早日實施於第八十七次臨時議會通過成立之戰時緊急措置法，乃以法制局爲中心，由議會閉幕後即着着行性各項準備，於十九日至閣議席間，業決定施行戰時緊急措置法及戰時緊急措置法施行日期之件一案，適應議會席間修正之點，將該法案第四條戰時緊急措置委員會之機能之規定加以修正後，再經二十日之樞密院全體會議通過，日政府於二十二日以官報公布，於是此劃期之非常立法戰時緊急措置法，由二十三日起，即於內地，朝鮮及台灣開始寬施。</p>

<p>變前寗波至象山，交通至便，兩地相隔僅百餘里，有公路克通，汽車約三小時可達。目前環境特殊，公路毀破壞，往象山須繞通而行，費時達兩日。陸路治安尚屬穩定，舟行則沿途海盜充斥，尤以奉化過海處之翔下潭至黃溪段，最為危險。最近一次之洗劫，即發生於記者離奉化前之西日（五月二十四日），當時旅客除財物質損失外，即衣衫亦被剝一空。</p>
<p>記者在奉化僅小作勾留，當於五月二十八日晟由奉化縣城啓程，前往翔下潭，午後三時抵達。當日住於背臨碼頭之小飯店；按此種飯店，設備簡陋，室中除一牀一几外別無他物，門外亦無招牌。</p>
<p>由此渡海，過岸即象山縣之黃溪，全程約行七小時，舟行速率，視潮水之大小而定，且由兩岸開行時間，亦逐日而異。逢陰曆之每月初八與廿三日兩日，因無潮水，循例停開；初九起碇時間，則爲東方魚肚白時，以後按日推延三小時，即爲該日漸汎之時刻，週而復始，造物奧妙，由此可見。</p>
<p>次日黎明，記者戴月冒風，隨旅客可以行，搭乘帆船，飄過此汪洋一片之象山港，中途每見遠處有小船對航而來，疑神疑鬼。其當時旅客一羣情緒緊張，大有風聲鶴淚草本皆兵之勢，幸一路平順，晟八時許即抵封岸之黃溪，但猶距縣城十五里，故須改乘人力車，經一小時半始畢全程。象山之地勢，東南西三面連接大陸，北面臨海央規定將象山所屬之一石舖鎭」，劃歸南田縣。（按係新成立之縣份，其縣領除象山一部，寗海縣沿海之村莊亦劃歸該縣。）故較前略小，目前全縣僅設一鎭與卅六鄕·縣城所在地爲丹城鎭。</p>
<p>丹城係一古城，以其形式似　子，故又名　城。城垣圓如　　，其北首突出，極似　警，局圍計七里許。名勝古蹟至夥，其著者爲北城門外之北寺，塑有巨大之四大金剛，出諸明代名手。東城門外有東寺，雄偉非凡，西城外有「崖屋」，乃係天然之山洞，地勢頗高，鄕民每於重九佳日，等高於此。南門外則爲一片大平原，良田千頃，一望無垠</p>
<p>租田關係</p>
<p>象山全縣之田畝，約二百餘萬畝，丹城館則有田五千餘畝。其榮主與農民之關係，亦與他處不同，即田畝向無大小田之區別，僅於事前由種戶（佃農）出以書面之單具，即俗名「租票」，其格式大致如下：「憑單發租穀××斤，此照。年月日×××簽單。」業主於次年如對其佃戶不滿時（耕種不力或賴租），可於廿終通知佃戶，將其地收回，另行處置，佃戶不得異議，與紹興寗波奉化等處之情形不同。至其租穀數額，計：　等特田全年上下兩期爲三百斤穀，上上田。兩斯爲二百五十斤穀年僅一期租穀爲一百斤，又田畝之價格，目前特等田田價爲每畝廿萬元。</p>
<p>象山向爲產米區，曩者全縣所產之米，可供當地一年又半之民食，茲以微米及供應關係，兼以駐紥當地之隊伍，以有利可圖，往往將米大　運往外境阪賣，致每當靑黃不接之際，民食發生恐慌。記者抵達之日，象山縣之米價已高漲至四十萬元矣，（按四月中僅五萬左右）。</p>
<p>象散名產</p>
<p>象山出產甚多，如茅竹柴，蕃警甘，皆有大量之產額。前者出於西鄉一帶，每月總計有近百隻大帆船，運載來滬銷售；後者則出於東鄉，尃銷江蘇省之丹陽鎭江兩地。除此外，「下南鄉」兼產食鹽。而其最著名者，乃距縣城三十里爵溪之黃魚鮝。（俗稱「魚香」又名白參），與茅洋村五獅山之碘礦。（即綠石礦），爵溪之黃魚鮝產量至豐。其捐稅最近每船約抽十萬元，故數額至屬可觀，致每爲各方覬視，以利害關係，衝突時起，最後一次之火併，發生於本年三月魚汎期間，地方多事，小民苦矣。</p>
<p>民生一斑</p>
<p>象山民衆之生活，與浙東各地無賈，富者不堪苛雜攤派之滋擾，擔率逃避一空，貧者任人宰割，掙扎飢餓綫上。前者爲神士與富商階級，目下除應付「軍榖」「派款」「事業費」（係供應軍隊食物，油，菜，等）「臨時借款」外，最近又創所謂「應變費」，如鄕紳之據田百畝者，共「應變費」往往爲數十萬元，每每事起倉碎，強者條前來立索，否則立即拘往作質，是故鄉紳皆畏之如虎，祗有消極抵制，率眷逃之夭夭，貧民雖無「攤派」及「借款」之光榮，但在生活高漲之下。亦不易爲生耳。</p>

<p>前綫某基地二十二日中央社電　時屆雨季，冲繩之航空決戰，已臨一大轉捩期，此爲最値注目者。冲繩之敵擬將冲繩本島作爲進攻日本之最大基地，本島周圍敵艦隊之行動最近更形活潑，敵軍不但集結大量軍需資材，目由十五日以來，特設空母與戰艦等船團，以亦駛抵沖繩附近，航空基地除其·中兩飛機塲，伊江島飛機塲與目前激戰中之小祿飛機塲外，下瀨·御納：小那西方金武等新設基地網，業告竣工，今飛機塲已達十處，將來可容飛機千架以上。敵方將如何利用沖繩，於此可見一斑。截止本月十五日止，北飛機塲停飛機二百二十架，伊江島與中飛機塲各一百三十架，總計爲四百八十架。再以種類分別，北飛機塲有B24型機三十架，P51型機在伊江島機塲有六十架，北飛機塲有三十架，巨人型機在北機塲有一百七十架，又P38型機各機塲共計十架左右·敵將使集結於北飛機塲之四引警B24型轟炸機與伊江島之P51型戰鬭機，實施轟炸航空基地，或對陸卜攻擊，或破壞交通路綫。北中兩機塲之巨人型機，將爲破壞交通之主力，敵利用雨季極力準備次期作戰，強化基地及設置新基地，大量集結各種飛機。同時對南九州方面則連日偵察，日軍爲防患未然，正以全力準備激烈之航空決戰，進行萬全之措置，日茲地將兵士氣極盛，待　雨季解過後，當有一幕斷定本土決戰命遝之航空決戰。</p>

<p>禁閉勒索</p>
<p>錢茂穡等聞言，咸極惶　，要求幫忙，遂將伊等一併帶入亞洲旅舘四樓，臨時所開至四三四號房間內禁閉，並用手銬鎖住錢茂穡手腕，以示威脅。錢茂穡等喪失自由，楊勳業等遂乃設計向其勤索五十萬元，當由鄒炳文將身帶之現鈔八萬元，先行交付，其餘四十二萬元，由周川然負責簽發支票代整，並將各人之居住證扣留作質，楊勳業取得現鈔八萬元後，即持往三二七號房間交與張羅三，嗣復向錢茂穡等聲稱，此事代爲奔走，尚須酬謝拾萬元。翌日周川然收到錢茂積現鈔五萬元，並代簽發浦左農商銀行五萬元一張之支票八張，計四十萬元，速同現鈔，交由楊動業轉送張達三，支票二紙，共計十萬元，餘均自留化用。</p>
<p>當塲拘獲</p>
<p>事經錢茂穑報告滬西憲兵隊，於十九日鄒炳文正在和興新旅舘向周川然付現鈔十五萬元及上海滙源銀行支票七萬五千元時，被日憲兵常塲拘獲，送由警局轉呈本市市長呈奉國民政府交本庭審判，經本庭審理終結後，即檢同卷判，呈請國民政府主席鑒核，甫於日前接獲國府命令，遂於今（廿二）日執行。惟該案起意犯楊勳業，因非現任公務員，故未被判處死刑。</p>

<h3 id="c44">現代的千里眼　電波警戒機 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>「發見！一百七十度，〇百公里，感二。」</p>
<p>「知道，繼續追跡！」</p>
<p>——指揮室中，間不容鬆的發出命令。</p>
<p>剎那間，某電波警成隊士兵，眼和耳都緊張起來，全神灌注在「勃拉溫管」上。原來，爲科學精粹而晶而成的電波警戒機，現在已探知遠在南方洋上〇百公里的敵機了。</p>
<p>在高聲入雲的山上，收報塔彷彿被無形的綫所牽，時時緩緩地廻轉着。在這收報塔的內部，有一個叫做「勃拉溫管」的東西，構造十分巧妙，它可說是電波警戒機的靈魂。</p>
<p>收報室中央，有一根穿過屋頂的圓往，它的樣子很像潛水艇的潛望鏡。「一百七十度」「一百六十度」，觀</p>
<p>新兵器功用</p>
<p>「那根柱是收報塔。這是勃拉溫管。」陪我參觀的M中討向我說明。向管中一看，只見透鏡中有道靑白的光，沿着刻度塲合，稱之爲「感一」；在四十度時，稱之爲「感二」飛機進入電波警戒機的電波範圍時，管中的光線就發生屈折變化，並因徐徐移動的絲故，所以立刻可以測知敵機的位置。」</p>
<p>士兵將柄轉動起來，勃拉溫管中的映像也隨着時時刻刻變動。上方，大地圖上的指針，像時鐘針一漾旋轉。地圖上，以基地爲中心，有細綫向四面八方輻射出去，各綫都記有度數。地圖旁邊的兵，看着指針停住的地方，而　程度的自信，來下判斷·這點是英美所做不到的，只有我們神乎其技的日本兵纔能够。大體上，光輝淡的是高參飛行的B29，濃的則大多是小型機。又，光綫明滅激烈的，是小型機；明滅速度緩慢的，則是大型機。如果光綫的尖端呈現分歧之狀，那末來的敵機準是編隊的機羣。不過，實際上，這種變化極其微妙，若隱若現，很難確知。」</p>
<p>呵呵，想不到竟有這樣奧妙，怎不叫人驚詫呢？而隊員們觀測技術的高明，更叫記者不勝敬佩。</p>
<p>警戒隊生活</p>
<p>領導參觀的M中尉，在送我下出來時，順便將電波警戒隊的日常情形,一一告訴我。</p>
<p>據說，一分隊有隊員十人內外一于人一組，隔二小時交替一次。値班時，將全副精神集中在眼請上，窺視着勃拉溫管。吃飯時，飯食也從兵營裏搬米。就是在休息的時候，也不准外出。下班時，士兵決不閒遊，他們還要從事掘壕溝哩，燒飯煮菜哩，等等事務。隊長對於他們，也是很愛護的。</p>
<p>以後，我們去訪隊長某大尉。走入兵營，每個士兵的面上，都容光煥發。原來是另一小隊的電彼管戒機捉住敵機了。趕快走進指揮室，裏面是一片電話聲，電鍵聲和命令聲</p>
<p>「飛行號碼一（依照發見的次序，將號碼給予所見敵機），一百七十度，〇百公里，感二。」</p>
<p>「知道，繼續追跡。」</p>
<p>「飛行號碼三，一百八十度，〇百公里，感三，福十公里，輝度濃，尖頭多分歧。」</p>
<p>「知道，繼續追跡。一」</p>
<p>隊長的桌上，展置作戰地圖。地岡上，蓋一塊玻璃板。板上，畫出敵機的航跡。根據所得情報，將B29和小型機的模型，在板上左右前後地移動着「是編隊哩，今日的敵機！」M中尉說。</p>
<p>隊長時時應答電波警戒機分隊的報告，給以必要的命令。同時，更向某司令部報告。</p>
<p>「是作戰室嗎？敵機是小型機引導的B29編隊。」隊長拿起電話聽筒，自信地報告道。</p>
<p>兩三分鐘以後，無綫電傳來了防空情報。</p>
<p>圖上的紅綫，表示敵機正刻刻接近日本本土。突然，一個目標改變方向，朝南而下。「追跡！」「×分停止追跡！」「從×度到×度，警戒！」對於敵機所有的行動，一一加以監視，而主要目標的動向，則迅速確切地報告出來。未幾，敵機飛入肉眼監視的領域。</p>
<p>「P51約三十架，引B29四架，自九十九里濱侵入本土。」聽到了無綫電的報告，隊長的臉上始露出了微笑。士兵也喜笑顏開。</p>
<p>防空上需要</p>
<p>一　間，友軍制空部隊開始造擊。全體將士也都關心着戰果及損害。然而這個部隊的勇士，並沒有攻擊兵器，除出在心裏默祝活躍在防空戰綫上的人們成功以外，是沒有別的方法的。</p>
<p>隊長對我說：一我們的工作，是不顯明的。可是，它的重要性，你一定知道了。我們的信條，就是不讓一架敵機漏過我們的警戒繼。而且，關係這點，我們也有充分自倍。確實發見敵機後，我門希望大家在防空活動方面作十全的奮鬥，使損害減少到最小限度。只有在敵機的損失很大，我方的損害極少時，我們維覺自己的工作光榮無比。」（譯自六月二十二日大陸新報）</p>
<h3 id="c45">冲繩海面力泅記 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>四月末，當慶良間列島戰事吃緊時，日軍某部隊長，為與隊本部連絡起見，單身泅渡八里的海面，途中會遭遇敵方舟艇多艘，並與其巡邏的飛機相遇，幸而均能避過其耳目，未為發見，乃得力泅而抵冲繩本島，完成所負任務。其堅强無畏的毅力，以及百折不撓的鬥志，實足代表日本軍人的性格。茲將其經歷的情形，記述於後：</p>
<p>敵美登陸慶良間時，島上住民中，一部分未能直接參加戰鬥的婦孺，立即退避山地上，協力從事確保糧食等後方勤務。島上，幾乎沒有一人不參加戰鬥，即幼如國民學校的小學生，也削竹爲槍，拿起武器，偕同守備隊衝入敵陣。同時，收集各種馬口鐵罐等金屬器皿，製成手溜彈，以此　敵。</p>
<p>生死問題置諸腦後</p>
<p>因連絡及報告當地情况，某部隊長須親赴冲繩本島的守備隊本部，遂於四月下旬某日，離開該地，趁夜黑月暗之時，穿越敵軍步哨綫，單身游過慶良間及冲繩島之間寬約八里的海面。其大胆勇敢，不愧爲日本武士。在他心裏，早就丟開了生死問題，他只記得一件事，就是：那些尚未成年的小學生們，手裏握着手溜彈，和日軍勇士一同衝入敵陣，實行最後的攻擊。這個悲壯的塲面，淸晰印在他的心上。他決心要將這班少年們的英勇行爲，一一傳給後方</p>
<p>某部隊長出發時，天色已晴。他在昏闇中潛入敵陣，平安通過敵兵警戒森嚴的步哨綫，摸索前進，好容易才抵海岸綫。然而，難關在後頭呢！游泳術有充分目信的部隊長，果能安渡這個風狂浪湧的海面嗎？澎湃的怒濤，猛撲巨岩，雖在黑夜裏，也能看淸白色的巨浪·在這汹涌的波濤中，據說還有成羣的食人鯊魚·這八里的水面，危機四伏，不啻　海。而且天空中，更有敵美的巡邏飛機日夜飛翔搜索；海面上，滿載兵昌及給養品的敵艦艇羣，亦往來不絕。能否避過敵軍的耳目呢？天曉得！不過，大任當前，無論前途有什麽困難，全都不在他的</p>
<p>奮身一躍跳入驚濤</p>
<p>部隊長悄悄走到水邊，脫下夜服，背負軍刀，預備萬）被敵軍發見時，即行自刎。除此以外，隨身祗帶了一點糖果和生米；這是用油紙包起來的。準備舒齊，奮身一躍，　入驚濤中。雖說是南國之海，然在四月的夜裏，海水可也寒冷砭肌。月光被烏塲遮住，海上黑暗如漆，眞乎即將大雨。幸而北斗星猶在雲霄裏閃耀，部隊長固然非常强健，平時幾乎不知疲勞爲何物，但用力游了一兩小時之後，頭開憤於黑暗的部隊長，清晰望見了駛來的船體。未幾，且可聽到敵兵說話的聲音。部隊長趕快翻身潛伏所抱敵船破片的下面，待敵船邊去以後，方再浮到海面上呼吸。幸而月亮藏在雲間，海上漆黑一片，因此得免被人發見，而脫出了危境。</p>
<p>廿隻以上的敵軍舟艇，剛剛過去，接着又是飛機編隊的隆隆聲，震動了黎明時涼冷的海上空氣。滿佈天際的密雲，不知在何時已變淡了，在東方的水平綫上，開始泛出茜色的朝霞。在太陽即將湧起的天空，飛來了五架編隊的小型機。或許是敵方格拉曼艦載機吧。部隊長仰眼凝眺曉空，映入他瞳孔裹的，不是日軍的飛機嗎？翼下的日丸標識，也看得淸呢！剎那間，在部隊長凍冷了的肢體內，湧起了一股熱血，他很興奮，忘去了疲勞，高舉一手，盡力大喊。可是，飛機上的勇士，並不知道在這教明的海上有他們的勇敢戰友，正負着重大的使命，在盡力泅水裏。他們以整齊的隊形，一直向西東方飛去，瞬即超越了部隊長的頭上。他們大約是前往猛攻敵艦的特攻隊吧，部隊長停住划水的手，暫時忘掉了自已，目送友機，直到看不淸機影時，他的大眼，不知不覺落下淚來，鼻腔裏一陣酸。他並不感傷，祗是偉大的現實太使他激動了。</p>
<p>利用敵屍掩蔽自身</p>
<p>部隊長再　命遊水前通·這孫不知過了多少時間，太陽已高懸天空。天氣雖仍隱含突變的危機，但靠近熱帶的南國强烈的日光，不時穿過雲隙，照耀海面，冰一般冷的海水，也漸有暖意。這時，部隊長又聽到了飛機的聲音。這一次，却不是友軍的飛機，因爲顯然是四發動機的大型飛機的吼聲。仰眼察看，果然是敵美PBAY大型轟炸機。高度袛有數百公尺，似乎是從阿嘉島其地飛來的。在這以前，部隊長一路泅來，碰到了許多溺死的敵兵屍首。這時，在他附近，也有敵兵的屍體汆着，大約死了不到兩三日。他遊近一具濟身黃毛的巨漢死體，用他辦蔽自身，以敵機之目。他的妙計居然成功，平安無事的又逃過了危險。</p>
<p>重大使命終於完成</p>
<p>未幾，沖繩本島南部低低的山崗，映入了部隊長的眼底。自從昨日夜晚以來，游呀游呀的，不知有多少次幾幾乎陷入絕望的深淵，而現在，目的地終於近在眼前了。爲了完成所負的重大使命，這次敢死之行，終於有了結果。到了這裏，如果力竭而斃，那末眞是爲山九仞，功　二貴了。可是，肚子是餓極了，疲勞也達於頂點，全身已麻痹而失表感覺，肢體的動作，已不靈活。然而，憑著他堅强的意志力，麻本了的手足依然劃着十撥着。</p>

<h3 id="c47">縣政管理處租金施政概況 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡羹舜</p>
<p>本處最近兩月來之施政概况，記其可述者，約可分爲：　一般行政工作，　整頓警察工作，　協導田賦征實工作。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）一般行政工作</p>
<p>視察各縣區：本處自成立以來，對於各縣區施敎狀况及地方情形，亟欲明瞭，以使爲施政之參考。爰經遵照市長命令，於五月八日十一日十五日十九日及六月五日，五度沉東南等區視察，每次視察完畢，均將經過情形，編劇報告，列舉各縣居民政保甲警察田賦等工作推行情形，呈送市畏察閱，最近因舉行行政會議。所有未經視察各縣區，當於最近期分別前往</p>
<p>召集行政會議：爲强化縣政，並求增進效率起見，爰於六月十五日召集各縣長各區公署署長，舉行行政會議，所有各項中心議題，均針對親實需要，縝密討論，以備市長之採擇，現會議議決各案，已經整理就緒，即將分別昌報施行，嗣後對於決　各果進展情形，另當隨時公告。</p>
<p>强化保甲工作：本處視察各縣區時，發現保甲工作尚求能盡達理想之固定之給獎，在市府方面，亦感覺指揮不能圓滿，爰經會同保甲委員會，擬具辦法，所有保甲月捐，仍參照市區辦法征收，並以取之於地方，用之於地方爲原則，訂定經辦人員薪津辦公費等標準，現正在呈府核示中，一俟確定，即可通飭施行。</p>
<p>提高各縣公務人員待遇：此項問題，業奉市長論自七月一日起將與市區公務人員，一律待遇，俾使安心工作。</p>
<p>（乙）整頓警察工作</p>
<p>關於整頓各縣警察工作，爲本處施政重點之一，在四月二十日本處召開行以後，各縣是否認其整飭，有無陽奉陰違情事，亟應隨時調査，當經密派人員，前往各縣明查暗訪，切實報告，務達弊絕風淸之目的。</p>
<p>製發制服：本市及各縣警察制服，前經由市政府呈奉行政院令准，由市棉統會按照申請數量酌給，於六月上旬已經出貨，計所有各縣警察制服，正由市府招商趕製，約七月初當可分發各縣警察換着。</p>
<p>修理槍械：各縣警察槍彈上次警政談話會業經商決，呈府統籌辦理，但各縣警察局原有槍械之破舊尚可條用者，廢棄可惜，均經商情中央稅警總團或市警察局修械處，代爲修理，一面仍當呈府請求分別補充，以厚實力。</p>
<p>提高各縣警察局辦公費：關於各縣警察局辦公費，以前規定數目有限，每感不數應用，亟應酌予增加，爰經依據警政談話會商定辦法，由本擬定支給標準，一律按原支數目增加十倍，現已奉准通</p>
<p>（丙）協導田賦征實工作</p>
<p>田賦征收實物由市財政局主管，本處立於協導地位。此事在本市尚屬創舉，各縣征收除申江而外，均歸縣財政局辦理，惟在縣區中縣長爲最高行政長官，而事實上民衆對於縣長信賴最深切，爲謀各縣縣對於征收天賦實物負起切實責任，藉收最大效果，以資應付一切政需起見，除責成各縣縣畏隨時督飭各該縣財政局認眞辦現外，此次行政會議時，復經本處提議擬由各縣組織一有系統田賦這之機構，從事宣傳勸納督察等工作，詳細辦法，一俟擬訂呈府核准，即可通飭施行。</p>
<h3 id="c48">疏通米源 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 魯依</p>
<p>在米糧瘋狂上漲，人民生活處於水深火熱之際，突見報載「疏通米源，充裕民食，國府採緊急措置。」的巨幅標題的電訊，正如久經荒旱的農人見到了天宇里的陰罪，讀了本報六月十六日社評「擁護米糧緊急措置」之後，對於所提供之數點意見實党彌定珍貴，尤以第二條，對於疏通米源問題，謂「希望各有關方面對於疏通米源，從速切實的負起協助與督察責任，尤其對於運輸方面特別需要，軍警人員對於米糧移動，不但絕對不准對難需索，並應隨時予以保護。」</p>
<p>事實上，在過去米糧民營運輸方面，確實是常遭非法軍警之留難與勒索，就以上海四鄉近郊，單帮負販而言，前據新申報調査，沿途勒索關口竟多至五十餘處，不僅負販者備受壓榨之苦，即一般升斗小民之食米來源十九仰求於此項單帮之負販者，其影饗實匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>上海米糧之來源，除四鄉近郊之外，也多賴於其他各產米區源源之接濟，在過去京滬線上一般單帮之販運，雖多屬零星少量，然也因各該產米區當局限制辦法互異，如蘇州，常州等地限制最嚴，即一般平民自食小量之米糧也絕對禁止出口，甚至食米附製品。粘糕，炒米粉，餅類食品也在限制之例，而南京，蕪湖一帶於今年開歷新年之前，無論船運火車原皆不受限制，因而單幫聞豐　起，羣趨販運，致亦遭當地嚴峻之禁運。</p>
<p>因之，一般單帮客多改運麵粉，赤荳，菉荳之類雜糧，對於上海民食問題也不無小補·然而各該搬運當地雖不受限制，而火車所經各地却復無理留難，除車上少數乘警（愛路警），黑帽子勒索敲詐外，於火車抵站停駛之際，一般非法軍警竟公然登車强取，（一般單帮客謂之搶車）不僅食米麵粉，有時竟連雜糧之類也無從幸免，迫於淫威之下，皆敢怒而不敢言，以致一般單帮客多視京滬綫米糧之搬運爲畏途，茲就管見所及，陳述數點於后：</p>
<p>米糧移動限制辦法應全面統一實行撤銷，不助並予以優先之便利，在過去雖各地當局並無米糧限制之地，也往往因各該鐵路當局之臨時措置而遭禁運之限制，然此項措置實每多係肖小者流假公濟私之舉，如南京火車站單幫客出站時至發票，也往往爲少數職員中飽私囊。至於過去火車行旅攜行李子重量與面積之規定，也應配合米糧疏通之實際需要，酌予款放和調整，俾使米糧運輸得以切實圓滑流通。</p>
<h3 id="c49">如何解決現鈔恐慌 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>現鈔缺乏在戰時通貨貶值的過程中，是不可避免的現象，但如果沒有牟利奸商是推波助瀾，情勢決不致如此嚴重。要消滅此種惡風，安定民生，筆者提出數點，以爲規範之獻：</p>
<p>財政當局即限期禁止撥款單流通市面，已流通市面的撥款單限期存入銀行，數額大的代以中儲本票。過去有些行莊濫發撥款單，一且收回撥款單，　用收縮，市面流通票據滅少，不但有助於解決現鈔恐慌，並且有利於抑平物價</p>
<p>中儲發行本票，票面應爲整額大數，最少在一百萬元以上，由中儲視市面需要，依各行莊之保證準備，由各行莊中請核發，隨時增加及收園，以調節實際需要。</p>
<p>私人支票，在一定數額之下，得持向原銀行蓋章證明，向商店購物，商店不得拒收或藉口加價。但須規定開票日後之一定期限內（如一星期），須解交銀行，逾期作廢，以防僞造遺失等糾紛，補助現鈔之不足。</p>
<p>中儲對於各行莊現鈔之供應，自應依據其業務範圍，酌量增加。各行莊對存戶提現，可按照一規定之標準，不得拒絕。如？</p>
<p>甲，每星期得提總存額幾分之幾（如十分之一）。</p>
<p>乙，上項提取現鈔數，每戶每星期不得超過若干元（如三十萬元）。</p>
<p>丙，若干欽額（如十萬元）以下之小存戶，提現不予限制。</p>
<p>丁，提存時給與中儲本票後所餘之另數，十萬元以上用本票，十萬元以下以現鈔補足之。</p>
<p>中儲於供給各行莊現鈔時，應記錄號碼，遇有貼現情事，得依擄其號碼追究　　。</p>
<p>禁止商店售貨，有現鈔及票據雙重物價</p>
<p>觀乎各小城市及鄉間並無現鈔缺乏恐慌，可知滬市輸出工業品與輸入之米糧價值，不能相抵，亦爲現鈔缺少之一因，政府亟應通令非通制之工業日用品之運輸，關卡軍警不得留</p>
<p>要之，現鈔缺乏在戰時雖爲不可進免之趨勢，最主要之造成因素，厥爲人爲之操縱與一般人心理上之恐慌，一且中儲能以巨額現鈔，在短期中僅量供應，人心安完，問題自易解法。更望財政當局能破除情面·澈査各行莊之遠法牟利舉動，則現鈔恐慌，不購迎刃而解也。</p>

<p>— 岑嘉</p>
<p>每天上學去，或是敬學回家，走過「文化街」的時候，小文總要在幾家大數局門前流連一番。今年起，雖然因爲他爸爸把他的十四歲的姊姊也送到廠裏去做工，留他在家照顧三歲的弟弟，不讓他繼續上學了，可是他偸空總是　會要在這裏流連陣。使他流連的是陳列在窗裹的偏重圖畫的兒童讀物。——看着這些讀物底紅紅緣綠色彩鮮豔的封面，也好像站在「冠生園」門前奇精緻的蛋糕，餅　，滴。小文一向慣喫的是一向着慣的也是畫得又彩色的連環圖畫。以前讀物時候，那些連環圖見了之後，那些東西可書店的大門上雖然不曾掛着「大門八字開，無錢莫進來」的招牌，但通常小文除了在門外徘徊徘徊之外，却不敢進去。有一次，他曾經一鼓作氣試着進表過，可是他那顫抖的手剛剛觸到擺在櫃上的書本，還沒有翻開來　一個職員就大聲吆喝：</p>
<p>「小鬼，你買不買？」</p>
<p>「我……」</p>
<p>「你看——書都給你弄葬了！」</p>
<p>「眼睛骨溜溜的——一定想偷！」另一個店員說。</p>
<p>小文給駡得昏頭昏腦的，一時不知道怎麼分辯，只是木然的站着。</p>
<p>「還不走！站着幹什麽？」</p>
<p>但是今天，小文可又大著膽子走進一家規模最大的　店裏去。他走得非常輕，恐怕腳上着的破舊的布鞋會踏壞了或者沾污了地上鋪著的光滑的磁石。一面偷偷的留心着櫃檯裏的店員有沒有向他看，甚至　過來趕他出去；一面用手緊緊的蓋住放在袋裏數得的爛熱的鈔票，趣備萬一來盤問的時候，馬上摸給他們看——「我來買書的。」</p>
<p>這時，店員們不是忙着聊天，便是在應付顧客，倒不曾留心到他。小文終於平安到連了賣兒童圖書的地方。</p>
<p>小文的身材還沒有　台那麼高，以至正在尃心看小報的職員一時竟不曾察覺有人走近來。小文雖然喊了好幾聲「先生，買，瞻望着廚師裏各式新世果似的，令人　涎欲大餅，油條，麺疙瘩，模糊，又呆板，更沒有沒看見這些精美的兒童賽看看倒還够味；現在再也看不入眼了。</p>
<p>書！」不過靈音太微弱，一出口，就不知去向，這「先生」還是看他的報直到得一個女顧客穿着高跟鞋閣閣閣地走進來，才使店員如夢方醒的抬起頭來，順帶發現了小文。</p>
<p>「先生，買書！」小文高高的擊着鈔票。</p>
<p>「什麽書？」店員皺着眉頭懶洋洋的問，一面仍舊低頭看小報。</p>
<p>「先生，這……這幾本多少鏢。」</p>
<p>差不多本本書都是小文所喜歡的，可是獻出他身邊所有的錢——那是瞞着爹媽，把每天早是給他的一只大餅錢積了近一個月才積成的，——結果祗買到二本薄薄的的書。——然而本數雖少，可是隔着橱窗神往了這麽長久的寳書，現在居然拿到手，小文可已經要高興得發瘋了。</p>
<p>他緊緊的拿着書，帶跳帶奔的衝出來，險些把那個女客檯創。小文恐怕那女客要追來打他，奔得更快。但還沒有跨出門口，後　卻給人我住了。小」</p>
<p>「剛買的書呀！」</p>
<p>「剛買的？——發票呢？」</p>
<p>「發票呢？」小文張着一對圓鼓鼓的眼睛望着對方。</p>
<p>「這麼小的小鬼也會偷東西了，看你不出！」</p>
<p>那店員把書搶過來，一面舉起手，想給他吃耳光</p>
<p>「眞是……可以去間的。」小文用足氣力架開壓下來的手，一面伸出乎去想奪回被搶去的書。</p>
<p>結果，由於原先那個職員的證明，罪名總算洗刷了，埋怨還是免不了的。</p>
<p>「誰叫你跑得這樣快，發票找頭都不要！」</p>
<p>這小小的屈辱並不能減低小文買到書後的興奮。他還沒有怎樣看過裏面的內容，他很想在路上先　開來看一看。但看了之後，似乎怕這些美麗的圖畫會在強烈的陽光下消失掉，變成白紙，只得勉強忍耐，急急的向家裏奔去。</p>
<p>小文的家離開那些害店很近，不一會，就到了。</p>
<p>他　着搖搖擺擺岐岐發響的木扶梯，爬上了擱樓。擱樓裏幽暗得像岩洞似的，只有一個一尺見方的窗口，窗上的玻璃已經沒有了，用污黃的牛皮紙糊着，紙上也已經有好幾個裂洞。這擱樓又是非常低，只有小文能够直立着走路。地板上密佈着許多陣礙物——鉛桶，煤爐，瓦罐，油瓶之類，一不小心，就要撞倒什麽。</p>
<p>這時候小文的爹媽和姊姊都正在廠裏做工，家要只有小兄弟倆。剛才小文就趁弟弟睡覺的機會溜出去的。現在他的弟弟已經醒來了，正在聲嘶力竭的哭泣，作爲堤防防止他摔下來的棉被已被他推在地上，要是小文來得遲點，他弟弟自已也摔下來了。</p>
<p>小文慌忙放下書，把棉被拾起來，拍去了灰塵，楷去了痰，疊齊了放在床上。又給弟弟揩去了眼淚和鼻涕，尋一些空匣，空罐，香烟書片給他玩，總算把他的哭過止住了。小文於是撤下弟弟，把唯一的　子推開去，拖過一把搖搖擺擺的竹椅子，熱在屁股下，然後小心翼翼的打開紙包，開始楷書了。</p>
<p>第一本題各叫「我的家庭，」——這是一個很體面的「家庭」：有花園，有童客室，有讀書室，有飯廳，有臥室，有廚房中……像具和各種擺設都非常新穎華貴，有許多凍西小聞遍見都沒見過。孩子們每天早晨都要喝一杯牛奶，三餐之外，還有奸幾頓點心。……他們在家的時候，有時在讀書室裏溫溫功課，有時讀讀有味的書報，有時在花園裏點踢皮球，拍拍羽毛球，有時哥哥妹妹聚在一起唱歌跳舞，有時圍成一圈聽爸爸媽媽講故事。……爸爸辦公完畢回家常常帶些糖果玩具回來分給他們；休假的日子，他常常陪他們去看戯，逛公園……。</p>
<p>還有一本是描寫這個家庭過新年一天的盛况的。這一天孩子們都穿了鮮艷漂亮的衣服，打扮得齊齊整整。他們發起開一個同業會，邀請學校裏親戚家鄰居家的小朋友來參加。把會客室作為會塲，掛燈結彩，安排座位，分配糖果點心，……着實忙了陣。等到一切準備就緒，小朋友也陸續來了。大</p>
<p>小文慢慢地一頁頁地翻過去，仔細地欣賞著圖畫，並且讀者旁注的文字，眼睛難得霎一霎。同時不由自主的用手撫摸着書頁，仿佛眞能觸摸到畫中孩子們的身體和糖果玩具的實體似地。</p>
<p>正看得津津有味愛不忍釋的時候·忽然弟弟大聲哭了！小文只得一骨碌站了起來，又尋出一些東西來哄得弟弟止住哭泣。接着把脫了筍頭坍在地上的竹椅子重新裝好，又拾起落在地上沾了痰的二本書，就用衣袖把痰揩去，然後再坐在椅子上，翻開來看。</p>
<p>書雖然還是同樣的書，但是被喚醒到現實環境的時候，部使小文開始把自已的家庭和書中的互相對比起來，他發覺兩者相差的距離，實是不可以相比擬的了！</p>
<p>而同時他又發覺書中的孩子們彷彿也有感覺能力似的，似乎已經看淸小文家裏簡陋破敗的情景，這會兒一個個都帶電嘲笑的神色看着小文，他們的一舉一動——無論　玩，無論喫東西，無論看書…………都好像暗暗地在叱駡他……</p>
<p>「小瘪三，站得遠點——你沒有這種福氣！」的確，小文從來不曾警過牛奶，下飯的小菜常常只是一碟鹹菜，一碟黃豆芽……除了一頓點心頓粥之外，他的爹媽散工回家，也難得帶點芝蔴大的糖給他喫。遇到空閒。他們也從不講什麽故事給他聽，一開口：不是畔嘴，便是愁米貴柴貴；陪兒子狂公園，看戯——更別提了。劈柴，泡開水，拎水，掃地，做煤球……這些都得小文來做；趁爹媽做工時候，還能偸空玩一陣；他們一回來，就耍忙這樣，忙那樣。到得夜裹，剛空了些，但沒有電燈·再顱爹媽他們一早就要上工，連油燈也不大肯點，老早就睡。而睡的又是石硬的板床……</p>
<p>爲什麽圖畫中的孩子們都過着那樣快活的生活呢？——這似乎不是沒有根據的罷。他在外面也常常看見和畫圖中非常相像的孩子。而自已部在受苦，這能怪他的父母沒有用嗎？可是他們明明常常做得疲累不堪，一回家就想睡覺。不久以前，有一次，當家裏祗有他們父子倆的時候，他爸爸咳了一會，忽然咳出幾口帶血的黃痰，那時因爲光線暗，他爹倒不曾留心，但正蹲在地上劈柴的小文却瞧見了，終於驚懼的叫起來。他爹俯下身子一看，搖搖頭，暵了一口氣，跟着用脚　去了痰，然後警告小文，不許說給媽總。一直到現在，還時常在吐，小文從不見爹去看一回醫生，吃一點藥。雖然他的爸爸常常耍打他駡他，有時甚至還要打媽媽，常常氣得媽媽哭起來。但爹不在的時候媽媽常常緊緊的抱着他，流着淚告訴他，不要一因此怨恨爹，他實在是個非常正直規知的人，做事極勤懇，烟酒都不來。只因爲他這樣做牛做馬，非但做不出頭，連活下去也要發生問題了，心裏悶氣已極，態度便大變了。小文也覺得爹並不是一個凶狠的人，房東來討房錢的時候，放債的來要償時候，任他們說得怎麽兇，駡得怎麽刻毒，他爹總是竭力陪小心，一味哀求。</p>
<p>小文越想越不明自，一個龐大的疑問號像一把鐵刀似的在他脆弱的心中刈割。</p>
<p>那兩本書先後在這時從他的手裏滑到地上，小文一點都不覺得。</p>

<p>— 令皦</p>
<p>請不要用那悲哀的聲調告訴我：「人生不過是一塲夢」吧！</p>
<p>即入你所說，把人生視若幻夢，我們也要使這個夢——努力的——使成為更美麗，更生動。難道你不願在夢中，看見自已，高騎着駿馬，橫著寶劍，戰勝一切嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c52">奴隸的愛情 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 曉風</p>
<p>奴隸的愛情，開不出美麗的花朶。」</p>
<p>記得在一首什麽歌詞裏。曾有這兩句。當時署了，發生了許多疑問，爲什麽奴隸的愛情，不會有美麗的花朶呢？奴隸不也是人嗎？同時，奴隸又是怎樣的一些人呢？當時在我稚小的心愛裏，確實了解不了這麽許多，所以我也不怎麽歡喜這首歌，別人喝這首歌的時候，沉聲的情調雖然刺激了我，然而老實說，我歡喜的歌曲還是那些輕快的呢，那些洋溢着奔故的情緒的，才陶醉了我。我是沉浸在這樣的歌聲裏。我曾經向原野，月光小淡高歌，也好像是原始的叫喊，然而這正是自然的一稱發洩呀，人類是蘊含了喜怒哀樂這許多情感的，所以，人類就爲這個而高歌了，歌唱自己心愛的，同時也歌唱自己憎恨的。</p>
<p>算起來也隔了不少時候了，我開始接近囂鬧的空氣，爵士樂曲和我相隨同在。樸眞的歌聲漸漸離開我，在我的記憶裏慚慚消逝，一些粗野的歌詞也漸漸忘懷了。我學會了矯揉造作，也學會了歌唱一些矯揉造作的歌詞，雖然這也是包含了一種美的，然而這是另外一種美，美在世界上眞是有不少型式的呀，我追求了這樣一種美的型式，同時我也追求那些別一樣美的型式。我也想這是一種車受，兼收並蓄充實了我，我是感到滿足了，我吸牧了新的美的型式，同時也丟棄了舊的美的型式。</p>
<p>仍舊和往日一樣，最近我聽聽歌壇上的小姐扭扭揑揑地歌唱，也在湖畔聽聽那些乘風而來的低沉的吟唱·有時我興奮地要向他們詢問些什慶，有時我默默無言。然而，告訴你呀，這是是一點都不含糊的呀，在一個　辦的角落裏，我聽到了那久已忘懷的歌聲！</p>
<p>「奴隸的愛情開不出美麗的花朶。」</p>
<p>雖然歌聲的情調照樣是沉鬱的，然而這明明是尖銳的音波在抖動，我能應想出這是一條輕快的聲帶所發出來的音響呀。我奇怪了，爲什麽不唱些明快的歌詞呢？</p>
<p>在依稀的月光下，那個鐵質欄杼的後面，音波是從那裏透展出來的。那是一個女孩子呀，她的髮慘鮮明地呈露在黑暗裏。她一點也沒有憂鬱的情調，我知道她是具有愉快的心腸的。她是隨便在哼哼，她並沒有體會那歌調裏的沉欎性，不過是在唱唱玩兒　了</p>
<p>我有禮貌地向她詢問，不，簡直有些質問的意思了：</p>
<p>「姑娘，就憑你……也能够明白奴隸的愛情嗎」</p>
<p>之後，就知道得更多一些了，她曾很有耐性的告訴了我許多：</p>
<p>「奴隸不一定是婢僕，也不一定是那此戰爭的俘虜，也不一定是歷史上的那些關於奴隸的故事。……</p>
<p>「只要是建築在金錢的基礎上的愛情，是不會開出美麗的花果來的。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」那仍舊有此疑問似的想。　　每當沉鬰的歌聲響起，尖銳的音波向我繚繞不絕，我是爲這不調和的歌聲擾亂了。</p>

<p>— 林淇</p>
<p>樹林中學的高中二敎室裏流傳着一個消息：陳士嘉在追求徐美文。</p>
<p>大家講到這個消息的時候，都不自覺的向前面那個徐美文看一眼，再溜到後面，偸偸地瞅一下那個穿西裝的傢伙。</p>
<p>徐美文坐在第一排，後面的人一看就看見。徐美文現在正在借着坐在隔壁的黃桂芬的代數簿子在抄。</p>
<p>於是那個老凌就表示不屑似地披一下嘴，說：</p>
<p>「徐美文有啥道理？借別人代數抄。」</p>
<p>「阿Q！」有人抱不平：「你自已追不着，吃乾請，」</p>
<p>大家就轟的笑起來。於是又有人回過頭去看一下陳士嘉。</p>
<p>那個穿西裝的傢伙正埋頭在看一本張資平的小說，一點也沒有聽見別人的話，他正用全副精神去記億那些字句。看到一個女性的名字，他就會想到徐美文的那一對笑渦。</p>
<p>這會兒他正曾完一個短篇故事，於是問旁邊的范眞：</p>
<p>「喂！軍師！你說張資平描寫得好不好？」</p>
<p>這裏，要介紹」下范眞是陳士嘉的軍師，兼秘書，陳士嘉寄給女同學的信都是范眞包辦的，因此，那個穿西裝的小開管道位文學家叫軍師。</p>
<p>范眞是個文學家，他當然把什末任都不放在眼睛裏。</p>
<p>「張資平？噓！」他鄙夷地笑一笑；「老是那一套。」</p>
<p>陳士嘉覺得高興起來，他忽然想到范眞　他寫的那些信準囘有效果。可是——</p>
<p>「可是她到現在還沒回信來。——一個星期另三天了。」</p>
<p>「急什麽？」軍師安慰着他：「天下有這末便常的事？」</p>
<p>天下的確沒有便當的事。就拿他這回事來着？，爲了那个徐美文，他费了多少心思和时间来着？起光他只是放了學跟在後面，跟到弄堂口，看徐美文過去。站了一會，回來。繼而是找機會講話，可是　不知道：「直到現在，他還沒和她正式講過一句話。最後，軍師敎他一個計策，寫信去。然而，又是一個星期另三天沒有回信。</p>
<p>「徐美文竟然這樣刁？」陳士嘉暗暗想。</p>
<p>然而，眞是天知道。徐美文一點也不刁，徐美文這時候正在想着父親的那副復然的面色：</p>
<p>「這成什麽話？」那個老年人大聲叫着，手裏揑着那五張撕碎了的信：「我們家裏現在雖然不怎樣好，可是總是世代書香，我不能讓人笑我毫無管束！」</p>
<p>徐美文一點也不知道，連誰寫的都不知道。可是父親還限制她三天以內要回話，究竟打算怎樣。</p>
<p>黃柱芬告訴她敎室裏在造她的「謠官」，於是徐美文猜着了一半，加上這幾天來人們常喜拿她底名字跟陳士嘉喊在一起，例如王建璋，就常常無樣無故地叫起來：</p>
<p>「陳士嘉！徐美文的作文簿你有沒有看見？</p>
<p>於是大家又轟的笑起來。</p>
<p>陳士嘉曾經非常慷慨地答過大家，如果事情成功，每個可以吃著十粒糖。因此，爲了十粒糖大家都很希望事情成功。</p>
<p>雖然也有許多人並不大熱心。兪存志就說過：</p>
<p>「陳士嘉這種戀愛的方式不對！這是買賣，是一時的衝動，不是變愛！」</p>
<p>說儘管說，可是很少人聽他，兪存志一開口就是什麼共同的理想，互相的鼓勵什麽什麽的，好像世界上只有他懂得無愛。</p>
<p>「我是主張唯美義的。」文學家范眞也曾發表他的意見：「但也是發肉一致的，不像兪存志的什麽共同的什麽，互相的什麽的。所以，對於陳士嘉的事，我希望能於最短期問，促其實現，是所至魔。」</p>
<p>然而在最短期問，一點也沒有實現。</p>
<p>大家巴的巴的在等着那十粒糖。</p>
<p>有一天，陳士嘉終於接到徐美文的信了。</p>
<p>那上面非常簡單：我的父親最近曾撕了一封信，我相信是你寫的。了免卻以後大家麻煩，這些信還是少寫爲妙。美文陳士嘉立刻去找軍師</p>
<p>「道叫欲揚先抑。」軍師一副軍師口吻：「兵法云，實則虛之，虛則實之，依山人看來，此中大有道理！」</p>
<p>「別裝腔！現在怎麽辦？」</p>
<p>「速戰速決。放大胆子，跟她到她家裏。」</p>
<p>「不會有危險麽？」</p>
<p>「包在我身上。」軍師拍一下胸脯。</p>
<p>然而那天徐美文沒來，第二天也沒來。陳士嘉一打聽，原來是生了病。</p>
<p>軍師靈機一動，計上心來。</p>
<p>「老陳！你這回天賜良機，你大可以堂而　之地搖進她家，你說是全級的代表，來探問病况的。』</p>
<p>陳士嘉幾乎跳起來，他又想抱住范眞，大叫幾聲。</p>
<p>他在街頭買了一東紫羅蘭，軍師送他到弄堂口。接着。五分鐘，陳士嘉垂頭喪氣地出來了。</p>
<p>「　了釘子？她父親在家？」范眞看着他的面色。「停止進攻！我放棄。」那個小開沮喪地說。</p>
<p>「怎麼回事？」於是陳士嘉才詳詳細細地告訴他的那位軍師，第一個引起他的惡劣的印象的，徐美文只住了一個灶披間，裏面亂七八糟地什麼都有。——馬桶，鍋子，都在里面。並且，徐美文在喝苞米粥，連菜也沒有。</p>
<p>「我們家裹佣人的屋子還要比它淸爽得多呢！</p>
<p>其次，徐美文一句話也沒跟他講，雖然她底母親也還客氣地招待他幾句。這且不去管它，徐美文一表眼不停地看一本書，那本書，陳士嘉一看就知道是兪存志的。</p>
<p>「我問她：「是跟存志借來的麽？」她哼聲：「是的。」從頭到尾，我講了這麼一句話。」「兪存志還有這一手。」軍師像個戰敗者。</p>
<p>「所以，我放棄。並且，看看那間房子也實在吃不消。」</p>
<p>第二天，陳士嘉和業其一到學校里就放空氣。「嗨！你們知道，俞存志借大批書給徐美文看！」</p>
<p>這自然又是一個新消息，大家去問兪存志，兪存志可一點也不否認。</p>
<p>「借書就借書，有什麽大驚小怪的！」</p>
<p>「好！——」有幾個人叫起來。</p>
<p>「哼！」軍師范眞說：「誰不知道，用借書做幌子。」</p>
<p>「兪存志！你打算每人給我們幾粒糖呢？」</p>
<p>「你門瞎什麽？」兪存志漲紅了臉：「借書也値得這麽大驚小怪的？」</p>
<p>「爲什麽不借給我呢？唵！」陳士嘉找着理由。</p>
<p>「她自己來向我借的。」</p>
<p>她自己去向他借的！陳士嘉心里一振。他想：爲什麽他自已我沒有一本書可以借給人家呢？眞糟。他陳士嘉一本書也沒有，還那本張資平的小說還是向眞借來的。</p>
<p>「陳士嘉！氣不氣。努力啊！」有人替陳士嘉打氣。</p>
<p>「算了！」他自已想：「我又沒有書。又不會向徐美文說一大套的共同什麽，互相的什麼的。努力又有什麼用？」</p>
<p>他把這意思告訴了軍師范眞，范眞說：</p>
<p>「槽兄！照你這樣子一輩子也別想戀愛！」</p>
<p>陳士嘉抓抓頭髪，向那位軍師楞了半天。</p>

<h3 id="c54">下週二舉行　中葡盃決戰前言 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>有歷史性之中葡盃足球賽，在滬懾球壇上裁有良好之成績，但事變以還，即默默無聞，良以當局不暇及此。迄於本屆，當局組織之機構旣呈順利，乃有恢復中葡盃足球賽之舉，遂極爲一般球逃所注意。蓋中葡兩軍球藝，始終有其特殊之吸引力也。</p>
<p>本屆盃賽仍照往例取三賽二勝制，第一戰於太年一月一日在逸園球塲比一賽，第二戰二月十六日在跑馬應舉行。前駿爲元且日，次戰爲廢曆元且，可見當局之格外朮視此項盃賽。唯在第二戰後，兩單各勝一塲，已逾四月而無下文。凡我球迷，無不引爲奇事。直至最近（二十一日）當局方公佈。此項大決戰，巳決定於下週二（二十六日）下午五時在跑馬廳球塲。大有千呼萬喚始出來之情形，抑以好戯之必須如此姗姗來遲耶？</p>
<p>筆者乘大賽之前，切望於我中華隊之能獲得勝利，故敢略作貢獻。但在未談之前，擬借一二兩塲之簡情一補，蓋所隔時間較長，球迷或有淡忘之嫌，是則雖屬明日黃花，但可供參考。</p>
<p>第一戰葡軍勝利</p>
<p>一月一日在逸園比賽，因値良辰，盛况空前，結果四對二，葡軍獲勝。獲球經過，中華孫錦噸先開紀錄一對〇，第二球鮑休脫射中，一對一。上半時未分勝負。下半時第一球（即第三球）若V蘇若妙射第四球，韓龍海頂上開花，第五球叉爲V蘇若建功，第六球飽休脫顯成，總結果四對二，觀衆哎息。蓋是日中華隊陣容不齊，將士缺席甚多，茲錄出塲陣容。</p>
<p>葡萄牙</p>
<p>V蘇若護潘維克泰考司坦W潘脫遜里　奧維拉鮑休脫米柯萊脫A組柯沙萊　遼福恩</p>

<p>張李天生孟義良羅壽福邦　李義臣孫銷順倫張林根鄭英權韓龍海賈幼良</p>
<p>第二戰中華大勝</p>
<p>二月十六日（廢立元旦）在跑馬應交鋒。結果中華五對〇大破葡隊。但事實上，葡軍陣容凋零，中華隊亦以東華健兒之因一故不參加，亦未見如何勁強。故該賽並無如何滿意之戰情，得球者，　郁黎明，　李義臣。上半時完畢，　李義臣，　李義臣，　高秀淸，是日出塲陣容如下。</p>
<p>中華對隊</p>
<p>葡萄牙周麒麟郁黎畫高秀淸董李天生仕孟　良高保正潔吳起詳（上）郁黎明郁黎明（上）（下）雷世華</p>
<p>葡萄牙</p>
<p>格林堡勃拉格柯馬　漢　V蘇若沙柯萊脫萊遠A克拉沙伯拉遠</p>
<p>第三戰決定銀盃</p>
<p>此突如其來之決戰，已定於下週二比賽。以邇來球員之情况，未必能有最正常之狀態，則其演出之能否精彩，實未敢下斷語。唯旣以此賽有決定性之關係，假戲眞做，筆者處於新聞界地位，不得不作未雨綢繆之談。果屬爲時已迫，總較不談爲佳，兼望獲得銀盃，球史上總不能更易也。是則不妨先檢討葡隊之陣容，雖其中不無有變更之可能事實，但認爲最理想者，厥爲下列：</p>
<p>考司坦V蘇若潘維克泰W潘孫里奧列維拉飽休脫來克萊脫來遠</p>
<p>A柯拉沙福恩</p>
<p>根據上列陣容，而作葡隊之戰術推想，即退而其陣容或稍有調動，對其作戰方略或大致雷同。因葡隊之作風終屬如此也。其後衛，除盡力擋住敵翼之外，時作誘人越位之計，以省氣力。兩前衛必隨球在敵豐之間，不揮爭奪。中堅則坐鎭中央外，時作後　，其守衞型殆已可見。前鋒綫上，則着重於兩翼齊飛及中央突破之法。其中兩內鋒，多數時間退後作七個守衡來拼受及負帶球前綫之職。</p>
<p>明乎此，則中華隊之應如何對症下藥，以收克敵致果之效。先不妨擬以相當之陣容，以最近孫錦順之離滬，李表瞿永福之受傷，李義臣之近况欠仕，對於前鋒綫上，不無令人有材難之感。求其次，姑擬如后。</p>
<p>宋靈聖劉祖儒張　吳起詳　羅壽福邦　鐔福楨戴麟經綸　張林根　韓龍海</p>
<p>孟義良賈幼良（生力軍）劉顯漢·莊友仁·梁樹棠·郁黎明等。</p>
<p>依所擬陣容中之前衛及後衛，均有充沛之氣力，豐富之經騐，以之阻隊兩驚活躍，可以勝任。而兩前衛之俱能有帶球本領助畏攻勢。更爲可貴者，上列前鋒五將，應爲目下最合理想者。劉顧儒近况極好，大可勝任。戴麟經之中鋒，不可或缺者，蓋有連繁之實力。韓龍海有猛竄，正可利用對方擬用誘敵越位之良機時，竄進建功，極爲可能，此乃以毒攻毒。賈幼良最近非特不退，抑且有良佳之狀態，則其切勾之球，必有妙着·左翼劉祖儒脚頭頗住，大可從中一顯身手也。至門將之所以重張邦綸，余頗以爲劉顯漢或有生疏之感。張則在白馬隊二次之成績而論尚能滿意。</p>
<p>筆者乃紙上談兵，及處旁觀地位，作眞誠之質獸。不識其能邀當局之一盼而予採納否？</p>
<h3 id="c55">夏令足球賽前奏曲華倫戰滬警　今日下午作友誼塞 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 雙呆</p>
<p>足球聯合會在這足球季節已經完結，而夏季來臨的當兒，將舉辦夏令足球邀請賽。最初是準備六强，東·聯誼。僑聯·葡商·華倫·滬警。現在聽說東華以決定不參加。於是祗有五隊了。這件事情，己經醞釀了好久，大致等足聯會的進行便可成爲事實的。那末在這夏季裏，我上海人還能欣賞足球員馳聘球塲，倒是意外的眼福。</p>
<p>足聯會開辦令足球賽的目的，是在著使球員在夏天也有一個聯繫的機會，不現生疏，而到下一季比賽的晨光，乃有純熟表演，使水準有提高的可能。這辦法不可謂不當。但是，我以爲也許太苦了球倒是華倫和滬警兩隊，可說是新組織的兩隊。前者是丙組本屆的覇主，後者也一度盛傳有瓦解的說數，乃前者加以一番拉攏名將，後者竭力加以關整，於是兩隊也成爲相當可觀的兩隊。</p>
<p>現在消息傳來，該兩隊定今日（二十三日）下午五時半，在膠州公園作友誼賽。這也許是所謂夏令足球賽的前奏曲，也是這兩支新軍給予我人估計的機會。夏令足球賽的是否有號召力，道一塲球賽，有莫大的關係。</p>
<p>記者曾往華倫常局作一訪問。據負責人姚乃熾說，他們這次得德商僑聯華通各隊的名將來歸，實力相當雄厚。但是來自各隊，不免有烏合之嫌，所以便邀請名指導馬山兒担任指導。他用他最好的敎授法，像印就了材料充實的講義，每天到塲按着圖作詳細的講解。眞的，使一個個球員有最瞭解球路的機會。所以雖然是各隊集起來的將士，却已多有很好的默契。屆時果然不敢保險有如何的好成績，但是可以担保的，便決不會被一般人所想像的惡劣</p>
<p>滬警呢，因爲像勞勃可脫夫郁整華等離去，於是在季末時盛傳着有解散的說數，許多球迷是引爲遺憾。這次的能東山再起，多少足以使球迷們興奮一點。他們從乙組中選拔了良材，再拉攏了猶太隊裏幾個合柱，所以全隊也够稱整齊平均。所担憂的，上塲時是否有最佳的表演。</p>
<p>今天希望老大保佑，不要下雨，那末，道一堪友誼賽一定是球迷所亟於要看的球賽。更是足聯當局希望成爲事賽·至少可以觀察這二支新軍的實力如何，來做一下夏令足球賽的預算。現在探錄華倫滬警兩隊的軍容：</p>
<p>華倫</p>
<p>郎少山飽　事羅帝　紐堡　派克　陳效平劉祖儒　霆米迪　林家崢</p>
<p>王春江潑利霍</p>

<h3 id="c56">排球聯賽甲組冠軍　中北個人技術 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— （潔）</p>
<p>排球聯賽本週間因霉兩速經，以致比賽改期者頗多。女組甲組更無一塲比成，實無可補救之缺憾。上週對女組冠軍三省隊，筆者已爲介紹。茲不妨將甲組穩得錦標之中北隊全貌作一介紹。錄中北戰程，僅餘對白隊一仗，而其餘之隊，至少有二次以上之敗績，則即使中北敗於自隊，仍不影響冠羣。茲按次作各個之個人介紹。</p>
<p>汪領隊兼隊長</p>
<p>注仲陶係該隊之領隊及隊長，顧名思義，已可知爲一能說能行之士時聆其對隊最在賽前資後之談話，確多中肯之談·間亦戎臨陣，試頭排左一職。觀其身手，一望而知此中老將。唯以解有練習關係，察其在躍起攔網及扣殺之際，最多能維持半島，入後即覺其有要躍不起之象，彈性亦不够矣·</p>
<p>頭排右李賽中</p>
<p>李身材高大，益以彈性極佳，其拿手之絕技，爲躍起時問極準確之一剎那一記妙叩。不猛不柔，落點莫測。更以其來勢之快，敵隊遂無法挽救。悉寶中在北方時，對此道確曾負有威名，則無怪其爲健之身法，頗令海上球迷傾倒也。開球未見有獨特成功，允爲美中不足事。　頭排中麥炳堯</p>
<p>頭排中之技能，應重於托球，及銷綱二點。麥對此二點，均有成功。在排球塡上，久著應譽，輒視其托球之妙處，即與其搭手，僅須數次之練習，即可作供給最適當之球。殆其托球功夫，已珠化境所致。麥之身材雖不甚高，但在鎖時躍躍起時間之準確，問亦無多損也。再麥在驚險中有突作反手一扯之好球，而麥對於開球一道，未特不足言號。抑且時有速作不過網之二記，眞令人奠名其何以不能改善耶？</p>
<p>頭排左陳學崇</p>
<p>頗有人以爲陳學崇之排球係半途出家，實則非也，據云，彼求學北平時，對排球之興趣及技術均在籃球之上。陳彈力足，球迷無不知之。以此彼能躍得高，更力之足。故殺出之球，急而有力。敵隊以其高度，鎖網殊雜，而欲覓救起此球，更爲不易，乃與李寶中爲頭排左右逢原得分之大將也。茲於彈基力之足，攔綱自亦有其佔光處矣。</p>
<p>二排右趙雅林</p>
<p>甲組隊中本屆有新人之目者，唯趙而已。唯事實上趙在北國之排球聲名，固婦儒皆知之上將也。唯在北方時，趙乃任頭排之職，此番以人材之支配關係，故試二排右，或有以爲將有楚材晋用之譏。不料初試之下，即見其獲擊一記，如排出倒海之勢，凶錢無匹。於此可見其對排球之遮詣，其對於救球一項，亦能用其敏捷之腦筋，而出奇之演出，誠天材也。</p>
<p>二排中候若愚</p>
<p>任二球中者能救球接球之外，兼須有最有把握之出手，蓋甚獲球機會，因地位關係最佔多數，故必須視其出手之球，能供給頭排中，乃可作進攻之機，候若愚對扦球確有相當分寸。唯候對於敵球一項，已無昔日之矯健。或以余事漸增，跌扑方面，不無有因，候有時亦眞作猛敲一球，則亦多越逸之可能，極少把握。德評之，尚不失爲一員大將。</p>
<p>二排左源秉球</p>
<p>源身體殊瘦，必有人以爲其不能作有力之猛擊也。不料源之之殺，非但力足，抑有把握，不作無謂之輕視，爲最值得稱頌者。源在我人之記憶中，在排球壇上，始終維持此優越地位，有不卑不驕之正常狀况·源之腦筋極淸，有時在對方銷網得體，必作吊越過頂之球，此或從經騐中而來，源與趙爲二排兩邊有得分之健將。</p>
<p>三排右鄭吉常</p>
<p>鄭擅拳擊，則期身呸之殺博，不言可知，對於排球一道，素有研究。任三排有最敏捷之伸手，及不避傾撲之精神，故絕險之球，能作死裡逃生之挽救，嘆爲觀止。開球並住，董特其臂力之足，與夫經騐之深，可稱爲三排之奇材。</p>
<p>三排中黃耀華</p>
<p>年來排球員最紅於時者，黃開華也。黃救球少妙，非但實用，而救起時姿勢之美，無出其右。日救險球時，必作大聲之吼，待其聲出，球巳在其手中救出矣。基於上列種種原因，遂格外爲觀衆所應目。且也，其開球之佳，允執滬上第一把交椅，此其所以紅之另一原因矣。</p>
<p>三排左陳兆邦</p>
<p>陳與鄭吉常黃　華過去時隸一隊爲三排最整齊之三人。陳爲三人中較爲最穩重者，但其功夫，問亦無多讓於鄭黃也。唯其身體似較重，故臥地救球，少見應用耳。開球功夫，亦在水準以上。此三排三將，環顧滬上，堪稱第一餘如馬燦希·余郇十。卓國榮，李振中·包松圓輩，或以事罰，或有退讓賢路之風，故出塲機會較少，不得不從略矣。</p>
<h3 id="c57">壘球聯賽明日中非大戰熊貓獻身手 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 山苗</p>
<p>本届壘球聯賽，華人熊貓隊本定於星期二（十九日）與武士隊作處女賽，因雨地濕改期。明日（二十四日）星期日上午十時，熊貓將遇菲僑，在同興球塲（舊法租界勞利育路海格路口）。回憶去年熊貓在極度苦戰下，僅以一分之差，壓倒菲僑。故明日之戰，兩雄再度相遇，精彩自在意料之中，球迷萬勿錯過！</p>
<p>技術下相上下</p>
<p>該兩隊，從守的方面講，其技藝實不相上下，尤以兩隊之外翼均善接高球。但其內圍守壘，熊貓較勝一籌。即以游擊而言，華隊梁友聲坐鎭大關，任何擊出之球，將被其接殺。且熊貓各壘手合作純熟，對塡空（Cover）及雙殺均運用純熟。三壘手溫瑞雄之腕下擲球，任何走壘者如何迅速均望塵莫及。故明日球迷大可欣賞華隊少守壘妙技。菲隊守之弱點乃在二三壘。其游擊亦極平間，但一壘手及捕手唐喬斯榔殺頗爲準備，華隊偷壘應慎防唐喬斯之接擲，同時對投手泰山之擲球勿揮棒過早，因其頭球多　軟球且喜擲低球，華隊諸將應謹愼揮棒，免上其當。</p>
<p>比數必甚接近</p>
<p>明日之戰，其勝負必數，必甚接迈。何則？因華隊之弱點在攻，而菲隊之弱點在守。是故明日華隊之擊球，切勿擊高球。最好莫如低及在二三壘間之球·此點熊貓諸將能否操縱如意，實屬疑問。按諸日美之棒球隊，其擊球之方向一及遠近，亦屬戰略之一。例如在滿壘之絕對優勢時Fuill　base）應擊左外翼高球；在三壘有走壘員時，應利用短擊等等，在日美之棒球員，其揮棒均隨心所欲，觀察當時情勢，加以應變。我華隊諸將擊球，尚未達完美之境。能擊「全壘打」者，尤間少數。筆者曾觀熊貓之練消耗於守壘功夫，而對於擊球則疏於聯繫·此點望梁君注意及之。因守壘如何巧妙，若進攻無路，實屬從然。而在選任球員時，切忌著重其守壘功夫應多選用能擊之球員，使攻守得以平衡，而獲分之機會亦墮·尤憶去年冠軍葡商隊與菲僑比賽時，至終局時，菲隊仍以一分領前。幸賴葡隊之善擊，在最後一局中，由湯拔拉之「全壘打」獲最後勝利·此點足供華隊之參考。</p>
<p>華隊利用擊球</p>
<p>總之，明日之戰，華隊若能利用擊球，勝利自可預期·去年之所以勝菲隊，僅因菲隊之一壘手漏接，使梁友聲（是賽唯一之上壘者）得倫歸壘爾獲一分。</p>
<p>熊貓明日出戰陣容。</p>
<p>捕手王秀山，黃應瑞·頭手李啟勝，一壘王念祖。二壘溫天華。三壘溫瑞雄。遊擊梁友聲。中堅梁友文。左翼唐　業。中翼王念茲。有翼鐘保羅，梁友義。聞此戰菲對厲兵秣馬，準備一雪前恥，華隊應出全力擊敗之。</p>

<p>— 狄憲章</p>
<p>圓門球爲錢君旭倉始創之球戲，自民國三十年以還迭經表演賽友誼賽及杯賽後，漸見普遍。蓋圓門球蒐集籃球足球德國式手球及水球之優點而發祥，加以斟酌，截長補短，而有今日。益旦參加杯賽之球隊，不僅國人組織之球隊而已，即外邦人士亦樂從之；足證圓門球之裨益體格，良非淺顯。甚盼國內外體育界同人，加以推助，以期不僅普通於國內而已，即世界之任何一角，均能有圓門球之比賽，則亦可在運動之歷史中，爲國人增光不少焉。</p>
<p>民國三十年之秋，一次圓門球表演賽中，　荷錢君不羣，邀不佞及　君覺非担任裁判，當時所用之規則，悉照錢君個人指定之規則，在比賽之過程中，各球員對於圓門球之技術尚屬嘗試性質，精彩不多，但亦术見有何疵瑕。事後經多次之比賽，漸見欠妥，錢君乃在每次杯賽中，屢次修訂其原有之規則，於是圓門球之規則，漸臻完全之境，誠幸事也。茲列舉業已增改之各項，加以解釋外；更附以鄙見，質諸高明諒不致我議也。</p>
<p>各種球戲之規則，均本利益均等之原則則制定之，圓門球之規則當然亦非例外，兼之任何球戲之規則均經數次或數十次之改訂修正，方臻完美也。</p>
<h3 id="c60">球員人數 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>按第一次表演賽中，出塲人數，依據原有錢君擬定之規則中第五章球矇第一條「每隊應有六人（守門員一人，中鋒一人，左右前鋒各一人，左有後衛各一人）……」之規定，六人出塲。但當時因屬嘗試性質，球員之技術欠純熟，乃見鬆弛，不能使比賽中有使人興奮之精彩表演；於是在第二次之表演賽中，增加中衛一人，而得相當之成就。是後，遂規定出塲人數爲七人焉。再質諸第五章球隊第三條原文：「出塲球員每隊至少五人，凡未滿五人者，不得開始比賽」亦應改爲「出塲球員每險至少六人，凡未滿六人者，不得開始比賽。」　（未完）</p>

<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – To inspect the actual military and political situation in various localities, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government departed from Nanjing on the 15th of this month for a northward tour. Accompanying him were Zhou Longku, Director of the Attendant's Office; Chang Luying, Chief of Staff; Liu Yangshan, Deputy Minister of Civilian Training; Guo Xiufeng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee; Li, Director of the Central Hospital; and senior attendants Lin Ji and Lin Wenhai, as well as Major General Asami, the Supreme Military Advisor of the Allied Nations. On the 16th, they arrived in Bengbu; on the 17th, in Xuzhou; on the 18th, in Shangqiu; and on the 19th, in Kaifeng. They inspected various locations, listened to reports from local officials, reviewed troops, and addressed responsible Party, government, and military personnel. Along the way, soldiers, police, students, and the public lined up to welcome them, shouting slogans such as "Obey the Central Government," "Support the National Government," and "Long Live the Chairman," displaying enthusiastic emotions and demonstrating deep affection. On the return journey, they rested briefly in Xuzhou and Bengbu, and on the 22nd, they safely returned to the capital.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since assuming office, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government has shown exceptional concern for the general political situation in various regions. Previously, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he inspected Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. In mid-April, he visited North China. Now, with the situation becoming increasingly urgent, in order to understand whether the military and political facilities in various regions can adapt to the current situation, he took time from his busy schedule to inspect Anhui, Huai, and Henan provinces for seven days, passing through Bengbu, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, and other places. He was warmly welcomed by military officers, civilians, and Allied officials from all regions. Having completed his inspection on the 21st, he departed from Bengbu at 8:05 PM and arrived safely in the capital at 6:00 AM on the 22nd. A detailed account of the events is as follows:</p>
<p>Situation in Bengbu</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM on the 15th of this month, Acting Chairman Chen departed from Pukou aboard a special train for Bengbu, accompanied by over a hundred people. When the train departed, senior officials from various ministries and commissions of the Central Government gathered at the Xiaguan Wharf to see him off. It was raining heavily that day. After boarding the train, the Chairman frequently looked up at the sky, his face showing pleasure, as the capital had been suffering from a long drought, and the rain brought hope for agriculture. He seemed to feel no inconvenience from traveling in the rain. The train passed through Chuxian at midnight and Mingguang at 5:00 AM. Representatives from all sectors of the Party, government, military, and academia in these areas stood in the heavy rain late at night to welcome him. The Chairman sent special representatives to get off the train to express his regards and listen to their reports. At 7:30 AM on the 16th, the train arrived in Bengbu. Governor Lin Dongqian of Anhui Province, having heard the news in advance, had already made preparations and arranged a temporary residence in Tangyuan. When the Chairman arrived, Governor Lin led the heads of various provincial government agencies and senior Allied officials in standing solemnly at the station to welcome him. Amidst the melodious military music, Acting Chairman Chen stepped slowly off the train, raised his hand to greet the welcoming party, and went straight to the residence after leaving the station. The entire city was decorated with national flags, and the people lined the streets to welcome him with utmost respect. At 7:40 AM, he arrived at the residence to rest. After breakfast, at 9:00 AM, Governor Lin accompanied him to the parade ground. At 9:30 AM, the parade began. In the pouring rain, the Chairman ascended the inspection stand. First, the Chief Commander, Qin Hanqing, reported the number of officers and soldiers, police, defense corps, and youth groups under inspection. Then, accompanied by Governor Lin, he disregarded the muddy ground and walked around the parade ground to inspect the troops. All the inspected soldiers, police, youth groups, and students were greatly inspired by the Chairman's tireless spirit and felt deeply grateful. After the march-past, they respectfully requested Acting Chairman Chen to deliver a speech (the full text is recorded separately). The speech lasted for several tens of minutes. Finally, Governor Lin led the crowd in shouting slogans such as "Long Live the Chairman" and "Long Live the Republic of China," their voices resounding through the sky. At around 11:00 AM, the parade ended, and he returned to the residence. After a brief rest, he went to the provincial government to meet with officials and inquire about matters, expressing his deep appreciation for Anhui's military and political facilities. At 11:40 AM, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he sent representatives to visit the Allied Liaison Department and the Consulate General, to express condolences to the Allied Army Hospital, the Bengbu Provincial Hospital, and the Red Swastika Society, and to express appreciation to the Anhui Daily and the Bengbu Branch of the Central News Agency. At 1:00 PM, Governor Lin hosted a banquet in the provincial government auditorium, where the atmosphere was lively. At 3:00 PM, he went to Xiaonanshan to unveil the tombstone of the revolutionary martyr and former military commander Ma Wenbo and presented flowers to pay his respects.

At 7:00 PM, the Chairman hosted a banquet, and local senior officials and senior Allied officials were invited to attend. At 8:50 PM, he departed from the residence. At 9:00 PM, Governor Lin and others respectfully saw him off as his special train departed for Huai.</p>
<p>Arriving in Xuzhou for Troop Inspection</p>
<p>On the 17th, the special train arrived in Xuzhou. Governor Hao led all senior Party, government, and military officials, as well as senior Allied officials, in welcoming him. The special train arrived at the residence at 6:15 AM. The public lined the streets, and foreign residents also lined up to welcome him. The entire city was covered with slogans, and national flags fluttered in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. After Acting Chairman Chen arrived in Xuzhou, he saw that the city's buildings were magnificent and the layout was orderly, and he expressed his appreciation for the rapid reconstruction work. At 9:00 AM, he went to the Yunlongshan training ground to inspect the troops, accompanied by Governor Hao. The inspection began at 9:30 AM. On the inspection platform, the large characters "The Party Must Not Be Divided, the Country Must Be Unified" were spelled out. At that time, 21 cannon salutes were fired from White Cloud Mountain to pay tribute to the Chairman. First, the Chief Commander, Ji Rui, reported the number of officers and soldiers, police, defense corps, youth groups, firearms, and horses under inspection. Then, the Chairman was invited to inspect the troops for a week. After that, the march-past began. Approximately 20,000 soldiers, police, and students from Huaihai participated in the inspection, each forming a column of ten people. As they passed the inspection stand, they saluted. The troops continued to pass by for about two hours, and the Chairman stood in front of the stand throughout, frequently raising his hand to return the salute, showing no signs of fatigue. The soldiers were all inspired. The Chairman expressed his appreciation for the Huaihai soldiers' excellent equipment, outstanding quality, neat steps, and magnificent military appearance. After the march-past was completed, the Chairman was respectfully invited to deliver a speech (the original text is recorded separately). Then, Governor Hao led the crowd in shouting slogans. The inspection concluded at 12:00 PM, and he returned to the residence to rest. At 12:20 PM, senior officials from various departments and commissions of the provincial government met with the Chairman. At 1:00 PM, Governor Hao hosted a banquet. After a brief rest, the Chairman, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, sent representatives to visit various Allied agencies and organizations. At around 5:00 PM, he inspected the repair shop, the 25th Division training regiment, the Huaihai Hospital, and other places, expressing his appreciation. At 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for senior provincial officials and Allied military and political dignitaries. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and the atmosphere was lively. At 11:00 PM, he departed from the provincial government. Tens of thousands of officials and civilians lined up to see him off with lanterns, the lights glittering and winding like a dragon, creating a novel and unprecedented grand scene.</p>
<p>Arriving in Shangqiu</p>
<p>At 5:40 AM on the 18th, the train arrived in Shangqiu. Zhang Fengfeng, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Area, led the senior generals of the War Area to welcome him at the station. Local officials, civilians, and Allied residents and officials lined both sides of the avenue outside the city to welcome the Chairman's arrival. After the Chairman got off the train, he boarded a prepared car and went to Shangqiu County, where the welcoming crowds cheered enthusiastically along the way. Since the Incident, the situation in Henan had been unique, and few central officials had visited. Now that Acting Chairman Chen had come to inspect, their joy was indescribable. At 6:00 AM, he arrived at the residence. At 7:00 AM, he reviewed the troops, whose military appearance was extremely solemn. Division Commander Wang Xiangjiu served as the Chief Commander. The entire venue was surrounded by tens of thousands of spectators, who could be said to have come from all over the city, fully expressing their affection. After the inspection was carried out in accordance with the ceremony, the Chairman addressed the military officers and civilians of the area, emphasizing the issue of China's unification and encouraging them to strive for Henan's prosperity. Finally, Commander-in-Chief Zhang led the crowd in shouting slogans such as "Obey the Central Government" and "Support the Supreme Commander." Tens of thousands of people responded in unison, their voices shaking the sky. At around 9:00 AM, he returned to the residence, where the generals met with him. At 10:30 AM, Commander-in-Chief Zhang reported on the situation of the War Area. Then, the Chairman summoned the generals of various armies. After listening to the reports, the Chairman expressed his appreciation for the security situation within the military region, stating that the area not only maintained its special points but also occupied a complete surface, with no trace of communist forces existing within its borders. At 12:30 PM, Commander-in-Chief Zhang hosted a banquet for the Chairman at the War Area Headquarters and invited senior Allied generals to accompany them. At 4:30 PM, he inspected the military education corps, where the corps respectfully requested the Chairman to deliver a speech, recounting the failures of past Chinese education and encouraging them to abide by discipline and seek knowledge. The listeners were inspired. He then continued to inspect the ordnance branch and the military hospital. The Chairman showed great concern for the wounded and sick soldiers. At around 6:00 PM, he had earnest discussions with relevant parties. At 7:00 PM, he hosted a banquet for the generals. At 11:00 PM, he departed from Shangqiu for Bian, and the entire group went to the station to see him off.</p>
<p>Encouraging the People of Henan</p>
<p>At 4:30 AM on the 19th, he arrived in Bian. As Governor Bao Wen was away in Ping for official business and could not return in time, General Gu Bingdong, Director of the Kaifeng Pacification Headquarters, led the senior officials of the provincial capital, the public, and Allied officials and residents in gathering at the station to welcome him. The public and students waited on both sides of the road in the city. At 5:00 AM, he arrived at the residence to rest. At 6:30 AM, he went to the Pacification Headquarters to inspect the Fifth War Area. Commander-in-Chief Pang Bingdong was an old friend of the Chairman, and they were extremely happy to meet again in Bian. When the Chairman arrived, the senior generals of the War Area stood solemnly on the training ground to welcome him. The inspected soldiers were well-trained. When the inspection reached the technical demonstration, air raid sirens suddenly sounded. At that time, the Chairman watched the performing soldiers, remaining calm as usual. The inspected soldiers were greatly inspired by this spirit. After the demonstration was completed, at 12:20 PM, he gave a speech to all the officers and soldiers in the auditorium, earnestly instructing them on national peace and unification, repeatedly clarifying the importance of the Party not being divided and the country being unified, and analyzing the world situation, encouraging the military and civilians of Henan to strive for peace and work hard for unification. The listeners were deeply moved. At 1:00 PM, the provincial government and the Pacification Headquarters jointly hosted a banquet and invited Allied generals stationed in the area to accompany them. At around 3:00 PM, he had increasingly important talks with Chinese and Japanese figures. At 6:00 PM, he hosted a banquet. At 9:00 PM, he departed from Bian, and the entire group saw him off, with the public expressing their reluctance to part.</p>
<p>Returning to the Capital Yesterday</p>
<p>At 2:00 AM that night, he passed through Shangqiu, and Commander-in-Chief Zhang made a special trip to the station in the middle of the night to pay his respects. At around 3:00 AM, the special train continued eastward. At 10:00 AM, he arrived in Xuzhou, and Governor Hao led officials and civilians in welcoming the Chairman. After getting off the train, he went to the residence to rest. In the afternoon, he summoned relevant parties for earnest discussions. At 9:00 AM, he responded to Xuzhou. On the 21st, at 6:00 AM, he arrived in Lin, and Governor led officials in welcoming him. At 6:05 AM, the Anhui Provincial Youth Corps presented a flag to the Chairman. At 6:10 AM, after resting briefly at the residence, he began summoning military, government, Party officials, and representatives of the gentry at the residence at 7:30 AM for instructions, which lasted until around 11:00 AM. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, local military and government officials respectfully requested the Chairman's calligraphy, and the Chairman granted their requests, writing many screen panels and horizontal plaques. At 9:00 PM, he departed from Bengbu, and the entire group saw him off. At 6:00 AM on the 22nd, he safely returned to the capital. Under the respectful welcome of officials from various central departments, he crossed the river and took a car back to his official residence to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Acting Chairman Chen's Address: Announcing Three National Policies, Striving for National Independence and Freedom <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Acting Chairman Chen delivered earnest speeches while inspecting youth groups in Bengbu, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, and Bian. This article is a comprehensive record. (A Record of Acting Chairman Chen's Address to the Armies of Anhui, Huai, and Henan) I am very pleased to meet you all on this inspection tour of Bengbu, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, and Bian. Along the way, I have seen new atmospheres in various local constructions, which are the results of the effective leadership of local responsible officials and the efforts of military officers and civilians throughout the province. Now, seeing the vigorous spirit and orderly steps of all the officers, I feel immense comfort and firmly believe that the Central Government has entrusted the right people to the localities.</p>
<p>I have two objectives in this inspection tour: First, the current situation is tense and at a critical juncture. It is important to know whether the general military and political facilities in various localities can meet the needs of the current situation. Therefore, I want to personally visit various places to understand the truth. At the same time, I am well aware that you have worked hard in the localities due to the complexity and difficulty of the environment. I would like to take this opportunity to meet with you and express the Central Government's condolences to all of you. Second, it is to announce the intentions of the Central Government and clearly tell everyone that the Central Government's policies will not change no matter how urgent the situation may be. What are the Central Government's policies? Simply put, they are "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Construction," which are the national policies personally set by the late Chairman Wang upon returning to the capital. We strive for national freedom through peace, achieve national unification through anti-communism, and consolidate national independence through national construction. No matter how urgent the situation may be, the Central Government will continue to work hard to inherit the legacy of the late Chairman Wang, and will not change now, nor will it change in the future.</p>
<p>Hoping for Three Efforts from the Military and Civilians</p>
<p>In addition to the above two points, I would also like to tell you and hope that everyone will work hard on the following three issues: China's participation in the war is voluntary, not only to strive for China's independence and freedom, but also to follow the teachings of the Founding Father. Because in the past century, in the Asian region east of the Suez Canal, except for Japan, which is an independent country, although Thailand is nominally independent, it is actually controlled by Europe and the United States and only maintains a semi-independent status. The rest, such as India, Annam, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, Sumatra, and Java, have all become colonies of Britain and the United States, and our China has fallen into a sub-colonial status. To strive for the independence and freedom of our own country, we must unite with weak nations to fight together. It is not enough to achieve China's freedom and independence alone; it is necessary for all East Asian nations to be liberated in order to guarantee our independence and freedom. If we examine the current situation, it seems that the European war has ended, but do you think that this is the true victory of Britain and the United States? Absolutely not. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e3">Rationally Solving the People's Food Problem <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the people's food problem, we have repeatedly discussed our views and made active suggestions to the relevant authorities. Since the authorities implemented emergency measures, we have further suggested that the second major task be implemented immediately, which is to make every effort to suppress rice prices, because emergency measures are a means, and suppressing rice prices is the goal. After rice prices are suppressed, we should further strive to rationally solve the people's food problem. Otherwise, temporary drops or easing of rice prices will be difficult to sustain. Our so-called second step of measures includes the following three key points:</p>
<p>First, the people's food problem is by no means a sudden problem. It has causes and will inevitably affect the people's food problem in the future. In order to rationally solve it, we should not only consider the present but also consider at least the next year. Therefore, we believe that before the autumn harvest this year, we must plan the most appropriate solution in advance, gathering opinions and strengths from all parties to promote it together. Regarding the most important purchase methods in the future, opinions from various parties are certainly not completely consistent, but in any case, in order to rationally solve the people's food problem and to fulfill the common purpose of the Greater East Asia War, close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the Chinese people is indispensable; it cannot be successfully achieved without any one of these parties. Therefore, before the autumn harvest, we must concentrate the opinions and strengths of the three parties to plan a comprehensive and appropriate solution.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of the current people's food problem in this city, emergency measures alone are not enough. After these emergency measures, we must take measures to ensure that the emergency measures are fully effective; otherwise, the problem will become serious again. What we mean by measures to ensure that the emergency measures are fully effective is to ensure the smooth flow of food rice sources. Speaking of this, relying solely on the grain merchants of this city is not enough. Because, today, to ensure the smooth flow of food rice sources, first, a sufficiently adequate capital cost is required, second, sufficiently adequate means of transportation are required, and third, the power to avoid various obstacles along the way is required. To have solutions for these three aspects is definitely beyond the ability of current grain merchants. Therefore, it also requires the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the Chinese people to achieve this common requirement of ensuring the smooth flow of food rice sources. The main thing is still for the municipal government to support it, or for a civil organization to cooperate with the existing, relatively sound food control agencies under the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese parties.</p>
<p>Third, there are still many factors hindering the rational solution of the people's food problem in this city. For example, because the aforementioned smooth flow of sources cannot be achieved, the authorities' emergency measures may lose their effectiveness. On the other hand, the vast majority of the people are suffering from double oppression. Because grain merchants need cash and do not accept payment orders and promissory notes in credit currency, ordinary citizens are subjected to double oppression and still have to buy food at the highest price. Our newspaper has recently received letters from people from all walks of life complaining about the pain in this regard, no less than hundreds or thousands. For example, a certain Mr. X wrote in a letter that he is an employee of a certain large department store, with elderly and young family members and no permanent property. In addition to his own lunch at the company, the salary he earns each month is only more than 60,000 yuan, and this month's income is only enough to buy one dou of rice. The company issues checks uniformly, and what is exchanged is only a payment order, and it is necessary to discount it to exchange it for cash, otherwise, it is impossible to buy miscellaneous grains, vegetables, and daily necessities. It is difficult for the whole family to survive on even a thin gruel. Another example is a letter from a cultured person, Mr. Mo, who was lucky enough to borrow a 200,000 yuan check and managed to exchange it for a payment order. He personally went to Zhoujiabang to buy rice, hoping to be cheaper, but no one accepted the payment order. After all kinds of efforts, he finally managed to discount it to cash at 80%. As a result, a loan of 200,000 yuan only bought two dou of rice, and he found 4,000 yuan in cash! Now, the general public is enduring unnecessary suffering under such an irrational situation. Therefore, we also hope that the relevant authorities will quickly seek solutions to the various relationships that actually hinder the solution of the people's food problem. Specifically, it is to: Strictly prohibit any behavior that hinders the smooth flow of rice sources. Thoroughly implement restrictions on banks issuing payment orders and effectively crack down on the evil practice of discounting. Public and private institutions should issue salaries in cash as much as possible; otherwise, at least salaries below 100,000 yuan should not be issued by check.</p>
<p>In short, in this decisive stage, everyone should abandon their own selfish profits and take the overall situation into account, and not let the vast majority of the people endure unnecessary suffering, thereby reducing the total strength in the decisive battle.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wartime Economic Measures Law Announced and Implemented by the Japanese Government; Tokyo Metropolitan Volunteer Corps Fully Established <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, in view of the tense situation that the mainland will be transformed into a battlefield, in order to implement the Wartime Emergency Measures Law established and passed by the 87th Extraordinary Diet as soon as possible, with the Legislative Bureau as the center, began to prepare various implementation items after the closing of the Diet. On the 19th, it was decided at the Cabinet meeting to implement the Wartime Emergency Measures Law and the date of implementation of the Wartime Emergency Measures Law. After adapting to the points amended at the Diet, the provision on the function of the Wartime Emergency Measures Committee in Article 4 of the bill was revised. It was then passed by the plenary meeting of the Privy Council on the 20th. The Japanese government announced it in the official gazette on the 22nd. Thus, this epoch-making extraordinary legislative Wartime Emergency Measures Law will be widely implemented in the mainland, Korea, and Taiwan starting from the 23rd.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Yodobashi Ward team of the Tokyo Metropolitan National Volunteer Corps was established today. With this, all 35 ward teams in Tokyo have been formed. In addition, 1,580 service teams in the textile industry have also been formed early. The overall service system of the entire textile industry in Tokyo has been largely completed. The Japanese authorities issued a mobilization order for this on the 22nd. The Tokyo Metropolitan National Volunteer Corps headquarters is scheduled to convene various cadres on the 23rd to review various matters, with the aim of dispatching them to various war-stricken areas within days to fulfill their mission.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Communication: Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (6) – A Ramble in Xiangshan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Before the changes, transportation from Ningbo to Xiangshan was extremely convenient. The two places are only a hundred or so li apart, with a highway connecting them, and a car could reach the destination in about three hours. Currently, due to the special circumstances, the highway is damaged, and one must detour to reach Xiangshan, which takes up to two days. The security on land is still relatively stable, but the sea route is rife with pirates, especially the section from Xiangxiatan to Huangxi after crossing the sea from Fenghua, which is the most dangerous. The most recent robbery occurred on the western day (May 24th) before the reporter left Fenghua. At that time, in addition to the loss of property, the travelers were stripped of their clothing as well.</p>
<p>The reporter only made a brief stay in Fenghua and set off from Fenghua County on May 28th, arriving at Xiangxiatan at 3:00 PM. That day, he stayed in a small hotel facing the pier. Such hotels are simply equipped, with only a bed and a table in the room, and no signboard outside.</p>
<p>From here, one crosses the sea to Huangxi in Xiangshan County, a journey of about seven hours. The speed of the boat depends on the size of the tide, and the departure time from both shores varies from day to day. On the eighth and twenty-third days of each lunar month, sailings are suspended due to the lack of tide. On the ninth day, the anchor is raised at dawn, and the departure time is delayed by three hours each day thereafter, in a recurring cycle, demonstrating the wonders of creation.</p>
<p>The next day at dawn, the reporter, braving the wind and wearing the moonlight, followed the travelers and boarded a sailboat, drifting across this vast Xiangshan Port. Midway, they frequently saw small boats sailing towards them in the distance, causing suspicion and fear. The travelers were all very nervous, with a sense of impending doom, but fortunately, the journey was smooth. They finally arrived at Huangxi on the coast around 8:00 AM, but it was still fifteen li from the county seat, so they had to change to rickshaws, which took another hour and a half to complete the journey. The terrain of Xiangshan is connected to the mainland on the southeast and west sides, and faces the sea on the north side. The Central Government stipulated that "Shibu Town," which belongs to Xiangshan, be assigned to Nantian County. (Note: This is a newly established county, and its jurisdiction includes part of Xiangshan and villages along the coast of Ninghai County.) Therefore, it is slightly smaller than before. Currently, the entire county has only one town and thirty-six townships. The county seat is located in Dancheng Town.</p>
<p>Dancheng is an ancient city, named after its shape resembling a "dan" character, hence it is also called "Dan City." The city walls are as round as a "dan," with the northern part protruding, resembling a "horn," with a circumference of about seven li. There are many famous historical sites, the most famous being the North Temple outside the North City Gate, which houses huge statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, made by famous Ming Dynasty artisans. Outside the East City Gate is the East Temple, which is magnificent and extraordinary. Outside the West City Gate is "Cliff House," a natural cave on high ground, where villagers gather on the Double Ninth Festival. Outside the South Gate is a large plain with thousands of acres of fertile land, stretching as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>Land Rental Relations</p>
<p>The entire county of Xiangshan has about two million mu of farmland, and Dancheng has more than five thousand mu. The relationship between landlords and farmers is different from other places. There is no distinction between large and small fields. Before planting, the tenant farmers submit a written note, commonly known as a "rent ticket," with a format roughly as follows: "Rent voucher for ×× jin of grain, for verification. Date ××× signed." If the landlord is dissatisfied with the tenant in the following year (due to poor farming or rent arrears), they can notify the tenant at the end of the year to take back the land and dispose of it as they see fit, and the tenant has no right to object, which is different from the situation in Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Fenghua. As for the amount of rent grain, it is calculated as follows: The best-quality fields require 300 jin of grain for both the upper and lower seasons throughout the year; the upper-middle-quality fields require 250 jin of grain for both seasons. Fields with only one season of rent require 100 jin. The price of land is currently 200,000 yuan per mu for the best-quality fields.</p>
<p>Xiangshan has always been a rice-producing area. In the past, the rice produced in the entire county could supply the local population for a year and a half. Now, due to the relationship of rice sales and supply, and the stationing of troops in the area, the rice is often transported to other places for sale in large quantities for profit, causing food shortages during the lean season. On the day the reporter arrived, the price of rice in Xiangshan County had risen to 400,000 yuan (it was only around 50,000 yuan in April).</p>
<p>Xiangshan's Famous Products</p>
<p>Xiangshan produces many things, such as maozhu bamboo, firewood, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane, all in large quantities. The former comes from the western part of the county, and nearly a hundred large sailing boats transport it to Shanghai for sale each month. The latter comes from the eastern part of the county and is sold exclusively to Danyang and Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province. In addition, "Xianan Township" also produces salt. The most famous products are the yellow croaker dried fish (commonly known as "fish fragrance" or "white ginseng") from Juexi, thirty li from the county seat, and the iodine mines (i.e., green stone mines) in Wushishan, Maoyang Village. Juexi produces a large amount of yellow croaker dried fish. Recently, the tax on each boat is about 100,000 yuan, so the amount is quite considerable, which often leads to covetousness from various parties. Conflicts arise from the conflict of interests, and the last major clash occurred in March of this year during the fish season. The local area is troubled, and the common people suffer.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of People's Livelihood</p>
<p>The lives of the people in Xiangshan are no different from those in other parts of eastern Zhejiang. The rich cannot bear the heavy taxes and levies and flee, while the poor are left to be exploited and struggle on the brink of starvation. The former are the gentry and wealthy merchants, who are now facing "military grain," "allocations," "operating expenses" (supplying the army with food, oil, vegetables, etc.), and "temporary loans." Recently, a so-called "contingency fund" has been created. For example, a local squire with a hundred mu of land often has to pay tens of thousands of yuan for the "contingency fund." The authorities often demand immediate payment, or else they will be detained as hostages. Therefore, the gentry are afraid of them like tigers and can only passively resist, fleeing with their families. Although the poor do not have the "glory" of "allocations" and "loans," it is not easy to make a living under rising prices.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the southern Shimajiri area of Okinawa Island, the enemy forces, with the joint support of aircraft and warships, continue to attack fiercely, actively attempting to penetrate the central part of the battlefield, and are gradually launching attacks towards the south. The Japanese garrison forces are in difficult circumstances, but their morale is exceptionally high. From the highlands of Aragaki and Maehira to Mabuni and Kodo, and from the 81st Highland north of Makabe Village to the area south of Maeri on the west coast, they have formed a strong defense and are engaging in fierce battles with the enemy forces.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese air force has repeatedly attacked enemy ships in the vicinity of Okinawa from the evening of the 21st to the dawn of the 22nd. Among them, special attack units daringly attacked two enemy battleships and one unidentified type of warship.

<p>Central News Agency dispatch – According to a Washington broadcast, United Press reporter E. G. Halon reported from the island on the 20th that large-scale fierce battles are now taking place in the northern part of Okinawa Island, covering an area of more than 500 square miles. With the support of artillery, cannons, and aerial bombing, the American troops are pouncing on the Japanese forces. The enemy's 27th Infantry Division is advancing into the northern region, crossing mountainous dense forests. This front line is 30 li from the northern end of the southern front line. American troops who usually fight in the mountainous areas are assisting the frontal troops in attacking Japanese strongholds.

<p>Central News Agency dispatch – According to a Washington broadcast, MacArthur's Headquarters announced on the 21st that General Joseph Stilwell, Chief of Staff of the US Ground Forces, has been selected by General MacArthur as the Commander of the US Tenth Army, succeeding Lieutenant General Buckner in commanding the army on Okinawa. It is reported that General Stilwell met with General MacArthur earlier this week to discuss the war situation and left the headquarters a few days ago, but he remains in the Pacific theater.

<p>Southern Frontline Base, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The control of the waterways between Palau and Peleliu Islands has a great impact on the enemy's operations in the Philippines and Borneo, and on the supply of the Mariana base, both now and in the future. Therefore, the enemy is actively transporting military supplies and personnel to that area and continuing to attack the Japanese troops defending the two islands. However, the Japanese army and navy units, with a small number of troops, have overcome the enemy and completed the important task of defense. Since mid-May, they have continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy, killing and wounding about a thousand enemy soldiers, sinking several small vessels, and recapturing several small islands. They are conducting close combat anytime, anywhere. For example, the Japanese army's night raid and close combat on Tarakan Island on the night of the 16th was extremely heroic. The island is the enemy's forward base, equipped with various weapons and underwater obstacles. The airfield is equipped with numerous searchlights, and there is a garrison of 300 soldiers guarding the strongholds to prevent Japanese night raids. On that night, the Japanese close combat assault team was divided into three groups, infiltrating the north, east, and northeast sides of the island using ambush tactics. They departed from their positions on the opposite shore in heavy rain at 8:00 PM. Because they could not use the mobility of boats, each member of the close combat team tied their weapons to their backs and swam forward in the heavy rain. After about three hours, they reached the landing point. The close combat team suddenly broke into the enemy's position, destroyed their main locations, and repeatedly engaged in close combat, killing and wounding more than 210 enemy soldiers, destroying two artillery pieces, one artillery tractor, three tanks, and eleven tents. This was the great achievement of the close combat team. At that time, the enemy had not expected the Japanese army to swim across the sea for a night raid, resulting in panic and disarray.</p>

The authorities are paying close attention to this. It is heard that the Central Reserve Bank is studying a thorough ban on discounting allocation notes in order to completely eliminate this evil practice, and a comprehensive solution will soon be implemented.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 6.5%, and the money supply suddenly tightened. The underground interest rate reappeared outside of 3%, and in the afternoon, those borrowing gold actually charged around one yuan, which was unprecedented. Cash premiums are still rampant, and a portion of the scum in the financial sector has infiltrated them. Although they are under severe sanctions from the authorities, these fellows are unafraid of the law and are still plotting behind the scenes. Therefore, it is not easy to eliminate them in the short term. This is because after the silver and money industries restricted the withdrawal of cash, depositors had no choice but to throw themselves into this trap.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Public Official Coerces Civilian Property: Case Cracked <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Da San, the main perpetrator who coerced civilian property and was executed by firing squad yesterday by the Shanghai Branch of the National Government Special Court, this reporter went to the court to inquire about the truth in order to understand the circumstances of the crime. The person in charge of the court granted an interview.</p>
<p>Framing Villagers</p>
<p>According to the discussion, Zhang Da San was a current public official who caused his own death by associating with bad friends. It is said that Yang Xunye, who used to be an interpreter in the Pudong Garrison Team, had recently been unemployed and was living idly. He thought that his nephew Zhou Chuanran (i.e., Yang Chuanran) often traded cotton and rice between Pudong and Shanghai, and that rice merchants and villagers from his hometown often came to Shanghai with him. He believed that these villagers were ignorant and could be framed as guerrillas and extorted for huge sums of money. Therefore, he agreed with Zhou Chuanran that if any villagers came to Shanghai, he should be notified immediately. He was also afraid that his individual strength was too weak to achieve his goal, so he invited Zhang Fengsan to participate when the time came. On March 17 of this year, when Zhou Chuanran was helping fellow villagers Zou Bingwen, Qian Maosheng, Yang Yunzhang, and others to come to Shanghai, he learned that Qian Maosheng and Yang Yunzhang had checked into Room 67 of the Anshang Hotel on Yongping Road, and Zou Bingwen had checked into Room 72 of the Xinxin Hotel on Da Shanghai Road. Because he also lived in Room 80 of the Hexinxin Hotel. At about 10 p.m., when the fellow villagers were playing mahjong in their room, he went to Yang Xunye and told him where the fellow villagers were. Yang Xunye went to Room 327 of the Yazhou Hotel, where Zhang Da San often stayed, and asked him to arrest them quickly. He also invited Liu Changchun and Jiang Hengrong, who were also public officials in the room but had already left their posts, to go together. Zhang Da San then carried handcuffs, and the four of them went to Room 67 of the Anshang Hotel, pointing out that Qian Maosheng and Yang Yunzhang were colluding with the guerrillas. They took them to Room 10 of the Hexing Hotel, pretending to arrest Zhou Chuanran as well. Then they went to Room 72 and threatened Zou Bingwen in the same way, taking him away as well. Along the way, they claimed that they were taking them to a certain place and then transferring them to the military police.</p>
<p>Detention and Extortion</p>
<p>Qian Maosheng and others were very frightened when they heard this and asked for help. They were taken to Room 434 on the fourth floor of the Yazhou Hotel, which was temporarily opened, and detained there. Qian Maosheng's wrists were handcuffed to show intimidation. After Qian Maosheng and others lost their freedom, Yang Xunye and others planned to extort 500,000 yuan from them. Zou Bingwen first handed over 80,000 yuan in cash that he was carrying, and the remaining 420,000 yuan was the responsibility of Zhou Chuanran to issue checks to pay for. Their residence permits were also detained as collateral. After Yang Xunye obtained the 80,000 yuan in cash, he took it to Room 327 and handed it over to Zhang Da San. Later, he claimed to Qian Maosheng and others that he still needed to thank them with 100,000 yuan for running around to help with this matter. The next day, Zhou Chuanran received 50,000 yuan in cash from Qian Maosheng and issued eight checks for 50,000 yuan each from the Puzuo Agricultural and Commercial Bank, totaling 400,000 yuan. He quickly delivered them along with the cash to Yang Dongye to transfer to Zhang Da San. The two checks, totaling 100,000 yuan, were kept for his own use.</p>
<p>Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>After Qian Maosheng reported the matter to the Huxi Military Police, on the 19th, when Zou Bingwen was paying Zhou Chuanran 150,000 yuan in cash and a 75,000 yuan check from the Shanghai Huiyuan Bank at the Hexinxin Hotel, he was arrested on the spot by the Japanese Military Police. He was sent to the police station and then presented to the mayor of this city, who submitted it to the National Government for trial by this court. After this court completed the trial, it submitted the verdict and case file to the Chairman of the National Government for review. Just recently, an order was received from the National Government, and the execution was carried out today (the 22nd). However, Yang Xunye, who initiated the crime, was not sentenced to death because he was not a current public official.</p>

<p>The reporter's regular meeting hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held in the Municipal Government conference room yesterday morning. Director Cai of the County Administration attended the meeting to report on the general situation of policy implementation and answer questions raised by reporters from various newspapers. The questions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Policy Focus</p>
<p>(Q)) Can you please show us one or two of the policy focuses since the establishment of your office?</p>
<p>(A) The policy focus of this office is detailed in the Outline for the Implementation of County Administration, and the current urgent tasks are to rectify police discipline, strengthen Baojia, establish public security, assist in the in-kind collection of land taxes, and supervise increased production.</p>
<p>Administrative Meeting</p>
<p>(Q) What are the implementation plans for the important cases resolved at the county and district administrative meetings?</p>
<p>(A) This is the first time that this office has convened county and district administrative meetings. The various proposals are all problems that each county and district urgently needs to solve. Now that they have been resolved, we should naturally take our stand and seek to implement them one by one, while also striving to achieve satisfactory results. As for the implementation plan, before implementation, we will first formulate a schedule for promotion. After implementation, we will compile an overview of the progress, and at the same time, we will supervise closely at any time. After completion, we will review them separately. If the planned goals are not achieved, we will strengthen or supplement them at any time. We will adhere to the principle of "resolving and acting" to achieve the purpose of the meeting.</p>
<p>Ensuring Public Security</p>
<p>(Q) The banditry in various counties has not been quelled, which is of great importance to the people's livelihood. Does your office have any specific plans to ensure public security?</p>
<p>(A) Although the banditry in various counties has not been quelled, each has its own special circumstances, and the weakness of military force, the unsound organization of the intelligence network, and the failure to earnestly promote Baojia work, resulting in the inability to establish public security, are also major reasons. This administrative meeting discussed this issue. However, how to take effective precautions, the methods are currently being formulated into specific plans. The plans to be taken are nothing more than: Strengthening the military strength of each county and coordinating the replenishment of guns and ammunition. Organizing a strict intelligence network to detect various intelligence. Strictly implementing household registration change registration, reviewing and randomly checking household registration, so that bandits cannot hide. Strengthening the Baojia self-defense corps and encouraging the people to automatically search for bandit traces, so that the military and civilians can unite and jointly bear the responsibility of maintaining local public security. Strictly formulating reward and punishment methods.</p>
<p>Eliminating Gambling</p>
<p>(Q) It seems that the gambling trend in various counties and districts has not been completely eliminated. How does your office plan to crack down on it?</p>
<p>(A) The county and district's smoking and gambling industries have been strictly prohibited by this office in accordance with the measures agreed upon in the police talks and submitted to the municipal government for promulgation. Afterwards, the county magistrates of each county should be instructed to instruct the police bureau to strictly prohibit them.</p>
<p>Teacher Treatment</p>
<p>(Q) At this administrative meeting, there were many issues concerning the Xingying matters in the counties and districts, but among them, improving teacher treatment and promoting Yijiao were the most fundamental considerations. I wonder if there is a whole Fang Zou method, and what is the method?</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the issue of improving teacher treatment, we are currently planning to work with the Municipal Education Bureau and the Finance Bureau to draft measures based on the actual situation and submit them to the government for review and implementation. What can be reported at present is that the mayor can issue the salary rice for teachers and staff of county-run schools from July onwards, equivalent to that of civil servants.</p>
<p>Police Uniforms</p>
<p>(Q) It is heard that police uniforms in various counties are being recruited locally. In order to maintain the dignity of the municipal government and prevent corruption, please order the municipal government to stop this and also unify the Ning method.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the police uniforms of various counties, the municipal government has previously requested the Executive Yuan to allocate them together with the fabrics required by the municipal police, which has been approved and is being handled by the Municipal Cotton Federation. The above-mentioned fabrics have been issued this month according to the requested quantity and are currently being rushed to be made by the municipal government's merchants. It is expected that they will be distributed in early July, so there is a unified method in fact. As for the police uniforms of the various counties and districts that have been manufactured and issued on their own, they were handled by the police bureau according to the measures agreed upon at the police talks, and the county government prepared an estimate and submitted it to the government for record, because it was not known when the allocated cloth could be received. However, since the end of last month, the municipal government has ordered all counties and districts that have requested self-financing to stop and wait for unified handling.</p>
<p>Troop Supply</p>
<p>(Q) For the issue of supplying local troops in various counties and districts, merchants are often asked to donate advance funds, but the receiving agencies have never published the accounts, causing much public resentment and repeated disturbances. The municipal government should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(A) This issue was raised by Nanhui County at this administrative meeting to stipulate the method. It has been resolved that this office will work with the Finance Bureau to draft detailed measures and submit them to the government for instructions.</p>
<p>Emergency Repair of Seawalls</p>
<p>(Q) The Saisan Seawall is in imminent danger. Please ask the municipal government to quickly raise funds for emergency repairs. The funds can be used for the pig tax designated for seawall expenses.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the repair of seawalls, the Baoshan County Government raised it at this administrative meeting, and it has been resolved to submit it to the government for review, and it has been resolved that the office can decide by the government.</p>

<p>Recognizing the large number of out-of-school youth, the Free Education Committee of this newspaper is eager to find ways to provide relief. In the spring, it discussed establishing several free middle schools in suitable locations, but it has been unable to implement this due to the difficulty in renting school buildings. Now, Ms. Yuan Aiyu, the principal of Lujia Road Free Elementary School at 10 Hejiaqiao, Fahuadong Town, has generously agreed to lend four classrooms, each capable of accommodating 50 people. The school building is spacious, well-lit, and has a beautiful environment, about one mile from the end of Taishan Road, making transportation convenient. This association has decided to first try running summer classes, enrolling three levels of junior high school and one level of senior high school, with 50 students in each level. Registration will be from now until the end of this month, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. The level exam will be on July 1st, and the school will open on the 2nd and will be on holiday until early September. All tuition and fees are waived, and students must provide their own books. It is hoped that poor students nearby will go to register on time to avoid being turned away due to being full.</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Modern All-Seeing Eye: Radio Wave Warning Device <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>"Detected! One hundred and seventy degrees, zero hundred kilometers, sensitivity two."</p>
<p>"Understood, continue tracking!"</p>
<p>-- Orders issued without a moment's respite in the command center.</p>
<p>In an instant, a soldier from a certain radio wave warning team tenses his eyes and ears, focusing intently on the "Braun tube." It turns out that the radio wave warning device, crystallized from the essence of science, has now detected an enemy aircraft zero hundred kilometers away over the southern ocean.</p>
<p>High on a cloud-piercing mountain, the receiving tower rotates slowly, as if pulled by invisible threads. Inside this receiving tower is something called a "Braun tube," ingeniously constructed. It can be said to be the soul of the radio wave warning device.</p>
<p>In the center of the receiving room, a circular object extends through the roof, resembling the periscope of a submarine. "One hundred and seventy degrees," "One hundred and sixty degrees."</p>
<p>Function of New Weapon</p>
<p>"That pole is the receiving tower. This is the Braun tube," M, a lieutenant, explained to me, who was accompanying me on the tour. Looking into the tube, I saw a pale blue light in the lens. When the light aligns with the scale at forty degrees, it is called "sensitivity one;" at forty degrees, it is called "sensitivity two." When an aircraft enters the radio wave range of the warning device, the light in the tube refracts and changes. Because of the slowly moving silk thread, the position of the enemy aircraft can be immediately determined.</p>
<p>The soldier rotated the handle, and the image in the Braun tube changed constantly. Above, the pointer on the large map rotated like a clock hand. On the map, thin lines radiated out in all directions from the base, each line marked with degrees. A soldier next to the map looked at where the pointer stopped and confidently made a judgment. This is something that the British and Americans cannot do; only we, the miraculous Japanese soldiers, are capable of. Generally speaking, the faint light indicates a high-altitude B29, while the dense light mostly indicates a smaller aircraft. Also, intensely flickering light indicates a small aircraft, while slowly flickering light indicates a large aircraft. If the tip of the light shows a branching shape, then the incoming enemy aircraft is sure to be a formation. However, in reality, these changes are extremely subtle, appearing and disappearing, making it difficult to be sure."</p>
<p>How incredible, I never imagined it would be so mysterious! And the skill of the team members' observation is even more admirable to the reporter.</p>
<p>Life in the Warning Team</p>
<p>Lieutenant M, who led the tour, told me about the daily life of the radio wave warning team as he escorted me down.</p>
<p>It is said that one squad has about ten members, divided into two groups, alternating every two hours. While on duty, they concentrate all their energy on their eyes, peering at the Braun tube. Even during mealtimes, food is brought from the barracks. Even during rest periods, they are not allowed to go out. When off duty, the soldiers never idle; they still have to dig trenches, cook food, and do other chores. The captain is very caring towards them.</p>
<p>Later, we visited Captain So-and-so, the team leader. Walking into the barracks, every soldier's face shone with excitement. It turned out that another squad's radio wave warning device had caught an enemy aircraft. Hurrying into the command room, it was filled with the sounds of telephones, telegraph keys, and commands.</p>
<p>"Flight number one (the order in which the enemy aircraft were detected), one hundred and seventy degrees, zero hundred kilometers, sensitivity two."</p>
<p>"Understood, continue tracking."</p>
<p>"Flight number three, one hundred and eighty degrees, zero hundred kilometers, sensitivity three, Fukui ten kilometers, high brightness, branched tip."</p>
<p>"Understood, continue tracking."</p>
<p>The captain had a war map spread out on his desk, covered with a sheet of glass. The tracks of the enemy aircraft were drawn on the glass. Based on the information obtained, models of B29s and small aircraft were moved back and forth on the board. "It's a formation, today's enemy aircraft!" Lieutenant M said.</p>
<p>The captain constantly responded to the reports from the radio wave warning device squads, giving necessary orders. At the same time, he reported to a certain headquarters.</p>
<p>"Is this the operations room? The enemy aircraft are a formation of B29s guided by small aircraft," the captain said confidently into the phone.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later, air defense information was transmitted by radio.</p>
<p>Red lines on the map indicated that the enemy aircraft were approaching the Japanese mainland. Suddenly, a target changed direction and headed south. "Track!" "Stop tracking at × minutes!" "Alert from × degrees to × degrees!" All the actions of the enemy aircraft were monitored, and the movements of the main targets were reported quickly and accurately. Before long, the enemy aircraft flew into the range of visual observation.</p>
<p>"Approximately thirty P51s leading four B29s are invading the mainland from Kujukuri Beach." Hearing the radio report, a smile finally appeared on the captain's face. The soldiers also rejoiced.</p>
<p>Needed for Air Defense</p>
<p>In an instant, friendly air force units began to engage the enemy. All the officers and men were concerned about the results of the battle and the damage incurred. However, the warriors of this unit had no offensive weapons, except to silently wish success to those active on the air defense lines.</p>
<p>The captain said to me: "Our work is inconspicuous, but its importance, you must understand. Our creed is to not let a single enemy aircraft slip through our warning network. Moreover, regarding this point, we have full confidence. After accurately detecting the enemy aircraft, we hope that everyone will make every effort in air defense activities to minimize damage. Only when the enemy's losses are great and our own damage is minimal do we feel that our work is gloriously unparalleled." (Translated from the June 22nd issue of the "Continental New Daily")</p>
<h3 id="e45">Record of Swimming Across the Sea Off Okinawa <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>At the end of April, when the battle for the Kerama Islands was intense, a Japanese unit commander, in order to contact the headquarters, swam alone across eight li of sea. On the way, he encountered several enemy boats and patrolling aircraft, but fortunately, he was able to avoid their attention and successfully reached Okinawa Island, completing his mission. His firm, fearless willpower and indomitable fighting spirit truly represent the character of Japanese soldiers. Here is a record of his experience:</p>
<p>When the enemy Americans landed on Kerama, some of the women and children among the island's residents who could not directly participate in the battle immediately retreated to the mountains to assist in rear-area duties such as securing food. Almost no one on the island did not participate in the battle, even elementary school students sharpened bamboo into spears, picked up weapons, and charged into enemy lines with the garrison. At the same time, they collected various metal containers such as tin cans and made hand grenades to attack the enemy.</p>
<p>生死問題置諸腦後</p>
<p>The department commander needed to take personal charge for contacting and reporting the local situation at headquarters on Okinawa Island, so one day in late April, he left and took advantage of the dark, moonless night to cross the enemy sentry line and swim alone across the sea between Kerama and Okinawa Islands, a distance of approximately eight li. His boldness and bravery were worthy of a Japanese samurai. In his heart, he had already discarded the question of life and death. He only remembered one thing: those underage elementary school students, holding hand grenades, charged into enemy lines alongside Japanese soldiers, carrying out a final attack. This tragic scene was clearly imprinted on his heart. He was determined to convey the heroic actions of these youngsters to the rear.</p>
<p>The squad leader set out when the weather was already clear. He infiltrated the enemy line in the darkness, safely passed the heavily guarded sentry lines, and groped his way forward until he finally reached the coastline. However, the difficulties were yet to come! Could the department leader, who had full confidence in his swimming skills, safely cross this rough sea? The surging waves crashed against the giant rocks. Even in the darkness, the white waves could be clearly seen. In these turbulent waves, it was said that there were also schools of man-eating sharks. This eight-li stretch of water was fraught with dangers, no different from a dragon's pool or tiger's den. Moreover, enemy American patrol aircraft were constantly flying and searching day and night in the sky, and enemy fleets loaded with soldiers, weapons, and supplies were constantly traveling back and forth. Could he avoid the enemy's attention? Heaven knew! However, with an important mission ahead, he did not care about any difficulties in the future.</p>
<p>A Leap Into The Alarming Waves</p>
<p>The squad leader quietly went to the water's edge, took off his night clothes, strapped on his military sword, and prepared to commit suicide immediately if he was discovered by the enemy. Other than this, he only carried a little candy and raw rice, wrapped in oil paper. When he was prepared, he leaped into the alarming waves. Although it was the sea of the southern country, the seawater was still cold in the April night. The moonlight was blocked by dark clouds, and the sea was as dark as ink, almost like a heavy rain. Fortunately, the Big Dipper was still shining in the sky. The department leader was indeed very strong and almost never knew what fatigue was, but after swimming hard for an hour or two, his head began to spin. He heard the sound of the ships, which had passed by many times, because he couldn't see anything in the dark. The commander clearly saw the approaching hull. Soon, he could hear the enemy soldiers talking. The leader quickly turned over and hid under the wreckage of the enemy ship that he was holding onto. After the enemy ship had passed, he floated back to the surface of the sea to breathe. Fortunately, the moon was hidden in the clouds, and the sea was pitch black, so he was spared from being discovered and escaped the danger.</p>
<p>More than twenty enemy boats had just passed, followed by the rumble of a squadron of aircraft, shaking the cold air of the sea at dawn. The dense clouds covering the sky had faded at some point, and a crimson dawn began to appear on the eastern horizon. Five squadrons of small aircraft flew in the sky where the sun was about to rise. Perhaps they were enemy Grumman carrier-based aircraft. The leader looked up at the sky. Didn't he see Japanese aircraft in his pupils? He could even see the Hinomaru markings under the wings! In an instant, a surge of heat welled up inside the leader's frozen body. He was very excited and forgot his fatigue. He raised one hand high and shouted as loudly as he could. However, the warriors on the aircraft did not know that on this sea there was their brave comrade in arms, carrying a great mission, swimming as hard as he could. They flew in a neat formation all the way to the west, instantly passing over the department leader's head. They were probably a special attack force heading to attack enemy ships. The squad leader stopped stroking the water and temporarily forgot himself, watching his friendly aircraft until he could no longer see their silhouettes. His big eyes unconsciously shed tears, and his nasal cavity felt a surge of acid. He was not sentimental, but the great reality was too exciting for him.</p>
<p>Use Enemy Corpses to Conceal Yourself</p>
<p>The squad leader continued to swim forward with all his strength. He didn't know how much time had passed. The sun was already high in the sky. Although the weather still contained the risk of sudden changes, the strong sunlight of the tropical southern country occasionally shone through the gaps in the clouds, illuminating the sea. The ice-cold seawater gradually warmed up. At this time, the squad leader heard the sound of aircraft again. This time, it was not friendly aircraft, because it was clearly the roar of a large four-engine aircraft. Looking up, it was indeed an enemy American PBY large bomber. The altitude was only a few hundred meters. It seemed to be flying from Aka Island. Before this, the squad leader had encountered many drowned enemy soldiers' corpses along the way. At this time, there was also an enemy soldier's body floating near him, probably dead for less than two or three days. He swam near a giant dead body with yellow hair and used him to conceal himself, in order to fool the eyes of enemy aircraft. His plan actually succeeded, and he escaped the danger safely again.</p>
<p>Major Mission Finally Completed</p>
<p>Before long, the low hills of southern Okinawa Island appeared in the squad leader's eyes. Since last night, he had been swimming and swimming, not knowing how many times he had almost fallen into the abyss of despair, but now, the destination was finally in sight. In order to complete the major mission he was carrying, this daring act finally had results. If he was exhausted and died here, then it would really be "failing after piling up nine mountains," a "one basket short of success." However, he was extremely hungry, and his fatigue had reached its peak. His whole body was numb and had lost all feeling, and the movements of his limbs were no longer agile. However, relying on his strong willpower, his numb hands and feet still stroked and paddled.</p>
<p>The residents of Okinawa Island discovered the squad leader, carrying a military sword and completely naked, lying on the coast near So-and-so, when it was already that evening. (Special correspondents Yagi and Fujita) (Translated from the May 20th issue of the "Mainichi Shimbun")</p>

<h3 id="e47">Overview of the County Administration Office's Rent Administration Policies <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Gengshun</p>
<p>The policies implemented by this office in the past two months can be summarized as follows: 1. General administrative work; 2. Rectification of police work; 3. Coordination and guidance of land tax collection in kind. These are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(A) General Administrative Work</p>
<p>Inspection of various counties and districts: Since its establishment, this office has been eager to understand the educational status and local conditions of various counties and districts to provide a reference for policy implementation. Following the Mayor's orders, inspections were conducted in the southeast districts on May 8th, 11th, 15th, 19th, and June 5th. After each inspection, a detailed report was prepared, listing the progress of work related to residents, civil affairs, pao-chia, police, and land tax in each county, and submitted to the Mayor for review. Recently, an administrative meeting was held. The remaining counties and districts that have not been inspected will be visited separately in the near future.</p>
<p>Convening of Administrative Meetings: In order to strengthen county administration and improve efficiency, an administrative meeting was convened on June 15th, bringing together the county magistrates and the heads of district public offices. All central issues were carefully discussed in light of practical needs for the Mayor's selection. The resolutions of the meeting have been organized and will be reported and implemented separately. The progress of the resolutions will be announced regularly.</p>
<p>Strengthening Pao-Chia Work: During inspections of various counties and districts, this office found that pao-chia work was not fully up to ideal standards. The city government also felt that command was not satisfactory. Therefore, in conjunction with the Pao-Chia Committee, measures were proposed. All pao-chia monthly donations will continue to be collected in accordance with the methods used in the city, and the principle of "taking from the local area and using it for the local area" will be followed. Standards for the salaries, office expenses, and other costs of the staff involved have been set, and the proposal is currently being reviewed by the government. Once approved, it will be implemented across the board.</p>
<p>Increasing the Salaries of Public Servants in Various Counties: Regarding this issue, the Mayor has agreed to provide the same salaries as public servants in the city, effective from July 1st, so that they can work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>(B) Rectification of Police Work</p>
<p>The rectification of police work in various counties is one of the key focuses of this office's policies. After this office convened the executive meeting on April 20th, the question of whether each county recognizes its reorganization and whether there are acts of outward compliance but inward disobedience must be constantly investigated. Secret agents were dispatched to various counties for secret investigations and honest reports to achieve the goal of eradicating abuses and purifying customs.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and Issuing Uniforms: The uniforms for the police in the city and various counties have been approved by the Executive Yuan upon the request of the municipal government. The Municipal Cotton Control Committee has allocated materials based on the requested quantities. The goods were shipped in early June, and the municipal government is currently inviting merchants to rush production of the uniforms for the police in various counties. It is expected that they can be distributed to the police in early July.</p>
<p>Repairing Firearms: The issue of police firearms and ammunition in various counties was discussed and resolved at the last police affairs meeting and submitted to the government for unified handling. However, it would be a waste to discard the old and broken firearms that the police stations in various counties already have and that can still be repaired. We have discussed the situation with the Central Tax Police Corps or the Municipal Police Bureau's Repairing Office, asking them to repair the firearms on our behalf. At the same time, we will still request the government to supplement the firearms separately to strengthen our capabilities.</p>
<p>Increasing the Office Expenses of Police Bureaus in Various Counties: The office expenses for police bureaus in various counties were previously limited and often insufficient. They urgently need to be increased. Based on the methods agreed upon at the police affairs meeting, this office drafted payment standards, uniformly increasing the original amounts tenfold. This has now been approved.</p>
<p>(C) Coordination and Guidance of Land Tax Collection in Kind</p>
<p>The collection of land tax in kind is managed by the Municipal Finance Bureau, and this office plays a coordinating role. This matter is still a novel undertaking in the city. With the exception of Shenjiang, the collection in various counties is handled by the county finance bureaus. However, in the counties, the county magistrate is the highest administrative officer, and in fact, the public trusts the county magistrate the most. In order to have the county magistrates of various counties assume real responsibility for collecting land tax in kind, in order to achieve the greatest effect and meet all the government's needs, in addition to ordering the county magistrates of each county to supervise the county finance bureaus in earnest, this office also proposed at the administrative meeting that each county organize a systematic land tax collection organization to carry out publicity, persuasion, supervision, and other work. Detailed methods will be drafted and submitted to the government for approval, and then implemented across the board.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Dredging Rice Sources <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yi</p>
<p>With rice prices skyrocketing and the people's lives in dire straits, suddenly seeing the news headline, "Dredging Rice Sources, Replenishing People's Food, National Government Adopts Emergency Measures," was like rain in the sky to farmers who had suffered a long drought. After reading the June 16th editorial in this newspaper, "Supporting Emergency Rice and Grain Measures," the few suggestions provided are indeed extremely valuable. Especially the second point, regarding the issue of dredging rice sources, it states, "It is hoped that all relevant parties will promptly and effectively assume the responsibility of assisting and supervising the dredging of rice sources, especially in transportation. Military and police personnel should not only be absolutely prohibited from demanding bribes for rice and grain movement but should also provide protection at all times."</p>
<p>In fact, in the past, in the private transportation of rice and grain, it was indeed often hindered and extorted by illegal military and police personnel. Taking the suburbs of Shanghai as an example, according to a survey by the Xin Shen Bao, there were as many as fifty toll booths along the way. Not only did the porters suffer from exploitation, but the source of rice for the general public depended on these porters for nine out of ten parts. The impact was significant.</p>
<p>The source of rice in Shanghai, in addition to the suburbs, also relies heavily on the continuous supply from other rice-producing areas. In the past, the transportation of rice by ordinary porters along the Beijing-Shanghai line, although mostly in small quantities, was also subject to different restriction methods by the local authorities in each rice-producing area. For example, the restrictions in Suzhou, Changzhou, and other places were the strictest, and even ordinary people were absolutely prohibited from exporting small amounts of rice for their own consumption, even rice by-products. Sticky rice cakes, fried rice noodles, and pastries were also subject to restrictions. However, before the beginning of the Lunar New Year this year, Nanjing, Wuhu, and surrounding areas had no restrictions on transportation by ship or train, so porters flocked to transport rice, which also led to strict local bans.</p>
<p>As a result, ordinary porters mostly switched to transporting miscellaneous grains such as flour, red beans, and mung beans, which also helped to alleviate the food problem in Shanghai. However, although the transportation of these goods was not restricted in the place of origin, the places along the railway line unreasonably made things difficult. In addition to a few police officers (railway police) and "black hats" extorting bribes on the train, when the train arrived at the station and stopped, ordinary illegal military and police personnel openly boarded the train to forcibly seize goods (generally called "robbing the train" by porters). Not only rice and flour, but sometimes even miscellaneous grains were not spared. Under duress, everyone dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out, so ordinary porters regarded the transportation of rice and grain on the Beijing-Shanghai line as a daunting task. Here are a few points based on my personal observations:</p>
<p>The restriction methods for rice and grain movement should be uniformly abolished across the board, and priority should be given to them. In the past, although some local authorities did not have rice and grain restrictions, they were often subject to restrictions due to the temporary measures of the railway authorities. However, these measures were often taken by petty people for personal gain under the guise of public interest. For example, when porters exited Nanjing Railway Station, even when issuing invoices, it was often a way for a few staff members to line their own pockets. As for the regulations on the weight and area of luggage carried by train passengers in the past, they should also be relaxed and adjusted in line with the actual needs of rice and grain dredging, so that rice and grain transportation can be effectively and smoothly circulated.</p>
<h3 id="e49">How to Solve the Current Cash Panic <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The lack of cash is an inevitable phenomenon in the process of wartime currency devaluation, but if there were no profiteering merchants adding fuel to the fire, the situation would not be so serious. To eliminate this evil trend and stabilize people's livelihoods, I would like to offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>The financial authorities should immediately prohibit the circulation of appropriation notes on the market within a time limit. Appropriation notes that are already circulating on the market should be deposited into banks within a time limit, and large amounts should be replaced with Central Reserve Bank (CRB) promissory notes. In the past, some banks and firms issued appropriation notes indiscriminately. Once appropriation notes are withdrawn, the use of funds is reduced, and the number of negotiable instruments circulating on the market decreases, which will not only help solve the cash panic but also help curb prices.</p>
<p>The CRB should issue promissory notes with denominations of whole numbers, at least one million yuan or more. The CRB should issue and redeem them based on market needs and according to the guarantee reserves of each bank and firm, so as to adjust to actual needs.</p>
<p>Private checks, under a certain amount, can be presented to the original bank for stamping and certification to purchase goods from stores. Stores should not refuse to accept them or use this as an excuse to raise prices. However, it must be stipulated that they must be submitted to the bank within a certain period of time after the date of issue (such as one week), and they will be invalid after the deadline to prevent forgery, loss, and other disputes, so as to supplement the shortage of cash.</p>
<p>The CRB should increase the supply of cash to each bank and firm in accordance with its business scope. Each bank and firm can withdraw cash for depositors according to a prescribed standard and must not refuse, such as:</p>
<p>A. Each week, a certain percentage of the total deposit amount can be withdrawn (such as one-tenth).</p>
<p>B. The number of cash withdrawals per household per week must not exceed a certain amount (such as 300,000 yuan).</p>
<p>C. Small depositors with a certain amount (such as 100,000 yuan) or less are not subject to restrictions on cash withdrawals.</p>
<p>D. When withdrawing deposits, if the remaining amount after giving CRB promissory notes is over 100,000 yuan, promissory notes should be used. If it is less than 100,000 yuan, it should be supplemented with cash.</p>
<p>When the CRB supplies cash to each bank and firm, it should record the serial numbers. If there is a discounting situation, the perpetrators can be investigated based on the serial numbers.</p>
<p>It is forbidden for stores to sell goods with double prices for cash and negotiable instruments.</p>
<p>Observing that there is no cash shortage panic in small cities and rural areas, it can be seen that the value of Shanghai's exports of industrial products and imports of rice and grain cannot be offset, which is also one of the reasons for the lack of cash. The government should immediately order that the transportation of non-strategic industrial daily necessities should not be detained by customs, military, and police.</p>
<p>In short, the lack of cash is an inevitable trend in wartime. The main factors causing it are artificial manipulation and the psychological panic of the general public. Once the CRB can supply a large amount of cash in a short period of time, people's hearts will be at ease, and the problem will be easily solved. It is also hoped that the financial authorities can break through sentimentality and thoroughly investigate the illegal profiteering activities of each bank and firm, then the cash panic will be solved easily.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Beyond One's Station <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Cen Jia</p>
<p>Every day when going to school or respectfully returning home from school, Xiao Wen always lingered in front of several large bookstore doors on "Culture Street." Although this year, because his father sent his fourteen-year-old sister to the factory to work, leaving him at home to take care of his three-year-old brother, and not letting him continue his studies, he always had to linger here. What made him linger were the children's books with an emphasis on pictures displayed in the window. — Looking at the bright red and green covers of these books, it was like standing in front of "Guanshengyuan," marveling at the exquisite cakes and pastries. Xiao Wen was always used to eating and watching colorful comic strips. Before reading, after seeing those comic strips, the things at the bookstore's door, although there was no sign saying "The door opens wide, no money, no entry," Xiao Wen usually dared not enter, except to wander around outside. Once, he tried to walk in with a burst of courage, but as soon as his trembling hand touched the books on the counter, before he could even open them, a clerk shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Hey kid, are you buying or not?"</p>
<p>"I…"</p>
<p>"Look—you've dirtied the books!"</p>
<p>"His eyes are darting around—he must be thinking of stealing!" another clerk said.</p>
<p>Xiao Wen was scolded until he was dizzy and didn't know how to argue, just standing there woodenly.</p>
<p>"Aren't you leaving yet! What are you standing there for?"</p>
<p>But today, Xiao Wen mustered up his courage and walked into one of the largest bookstores. He walked very lightly, afraid that the old cloth shoes on his feet would damage or stain the smooth tiles on the ground. He secretly watched to see if the clerks behind the counter were looking at him, or even coming over to chase him out. He held the hot, crumpled banknotes tightly in his pocket, ready to show them immediately if they questioned him—"I'm here to buy books."</p>
<p>At this time, the clerks were either busy chatting or dealing with customers, and they didn't notice him. Xiao Wen finally safely reached the children's books section.</p>
<p>Xiao Wen's height wasn't as tall as the counter, so the clerk who was focusing on reading the tabloid didn't notice someone approaching. Xiao Wen shouted several times, "Sir, buy, looking at the new fruits of the world in the kitchen, making people salivate for sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and noodles, it's blurry and dull. It's more flavorful to look at these exquisite children's books. Now, he can't even look at them!" But the voice was too weak, and as soon as it came out, it disappeared. The "sir" continued to read his newspaper until a female customer walked in with high heels, and the clerk woke up as if from a dream, raised his head, and incidentally discovered Xiao Wen.</p>
<p>"Sir, buy books!" Xiao Wen raised the banknotes high.</p>
<p>"What books?" the clerk asked lazily, frowning, while still looking down at the tabloid.</p>
<p>"Sir, how much are these… these few?"</p>
<p>Almost every book was one that Xiao Wen liked, but he handed over all the money he had—which he had hidden from his parents, saving the money for the big sesame cake they gave him every morning for almost a month—and only managed to buy two thin books. —However, although the number of books was small, they were treasured books that he had longed for through the window for so long, and now he actually had them in his hands. Xiao Wen was already going crazy with joy.</p>
<p>He held the books tightly, rushed out with hops and skips, almost bumping into the female customer. Xiao Wen was afraid that the female customer would chase after him and hit him, so he ran even faster. But before he could step out the door, he was grabbed from behind.</p>
<p>"Just bought the books!"</p>
<p>"Just bought them? —Where's the receipt?"</p>
<p>"Receipt?" Xiao Wen stared at the other person with a pair of bulging eyes.</p>
<p>"Even a little brat like you steals things, I didn't see it coming!"</p>
<p>The clerk snatched the books away and raised his hand, wanting to slap him.</p>
<p>"It's true… you can check it out." Xiao Wen used all his strength to push away the descending hand, while reaching out to snatch back the stolen books.</p>
<p>As a result, thanks to the confirmation of the original clerk, the charge was finally cleared, but the complaints were unavoidable.</p>
<p>"Who told you to run so fast, not even wanting the receipt!"</p>
<p>This little humiliation couldn't diminish Xiao Wen's excitement after buying the books. He hadn't even looked at the contents yet. He really wanted to secretly open them and take a look on the road. But after looking at them, he seemed afraid that these beautiful pictures would disappear in the strong sunlight and turn into blank paper, so he had to endure it and hurry home.</p>
<p>Xiao Wen's home was very close to those bookstores. Soon, he arrived.</p>
<p>He climbed the creaking wooden staircase to the loft. The loft was as dark as a cave, with only a one-foot square window, and the glass was gone, covered with dirty yellow kraft paper, and there were several cracks in the paper. This loft was also very low, and only Xiao Wen could walk upright in it. The floor was covered with many obstacles—lead buckets, coal stoves, earthenware pots, oil bottles, and the like. If you weren't careful, you would knock something over.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiao Wen's parents and sister were all working in the factory, and only the two little brothers were at home. Just now, Xiao Wen had sneaked out while his brother was sleeping. Now, his brother was already awake and crying his heart out. The quilt that was supposed to prevent him from falling off the bed had been pushed to the ground. If Xiao Wen had come later, his brother would have fallen off himself.</p>
<p>Xiao Wen hurriedly put down the books, picked up the quilt, dusted off the dirt, wiped away the phlegm, folded it neatly, and put it on the bed. He also wiped away his brother's tears and snot, and found some empty boxes, empty cans, and cigarette cards for him to play with, finally stopping his crying. Xiao Wen then withdrew his brother, pushed the only chair away, dragged over a swaying bamboo chair, sat on it, and then carefully opened the paper package and began to read.</p>
<p>The first book was called "My Family,"—this was a very presentable "family": with a garden, a children's room, a reading room, a dining room, a bedroom, a kitchen... The furniture and various decorations were very novel and luxurious, and there were many things that Xiao Wen had never seen before. The children had to drink a glass of milk every morning, and in addition to three meals, there were several snacks. …When they were at home, they sometimes studied their lessons in the reading room, sometimes read interesting books and newspapers, sometimes kicked a ball in the garden, patted a badminton, sometimes the older brother and younger sister gathered together to sing and dance, sometimes they formed a circle to listen to their parents tell stories. …Their father often brought back candy and toys to share with them when he came home from work; on holidays, he often accompanied them to see plays and visit parks….</p>
<p>There was also a book describing the grand occasion of this family celebrating the New Year. On this day, the children all wore bright and beautiful clothes, dressed neatly. They initiated the opening of a trade fair, inviting children from school, relatives, and neighbors to participate. They used the reception room as the venue, hanging lanterns and festoons, arranging seats, and distributing candy and snacks… they were really busy for a while. When everything was ready, the children came one after another. Big</p>
<p>Xiao Wen slowly turned the pages one by one, carefully admiring the pictures and reading the annotations, his eyes rarely blinking. At the same time, he involuntarily stroked the pages of the book, as if he could really touch the bodies of the children in the pictures and the real objects of candy and toys.</p>
<p>Just as he was reading with relish and reluctant to put it down, suddenly his brother cried loudly! Xiao Wen had to get up in a hurry and find something else to coax his brother to stop crying. Then he reassembled the bamboo chair that had come apart and collapsed on the ground, and picked up the two books that had fallen on the ground and were stained with phlegm. He wiped off the phlegm with his sleeve, and then sat back in the chair and opened them to read.</p>
<p>Although the books were still the same, being awakened to the reality of his environment made Xiao Wen begin to compare his own family with those in the books, and he realized that the distance between the two was incomparable!</p>
<p>At the same time, he also realized that the children in the book seemed to have the ability to feel, and seemed to have seen the simple and dilapidated situation of Xiao Wen's home. At this moment, they were all looking at Xiao Wen with a mocking look, their every move—whether playing, eating, or reading… seemed to be secretly scolding him…</p>
<p>"Little beggar, stay away—you don't have this kind of luck!" Indeed, Xiao Wen had never drunk milk, and the side dishes for his meals were often just a plate of pickles or a plate of bean sprouts… In addition to a snack of porridge, his parents rarely brought back even a sesame seed-sized piece of candy for him to eat when they came home from work. When they had free time, they never told him any stories. When they opened their mouths, it was either bickering or complaining about the high cost of rice and firewood; taking their son to the park or seeing a play—don't even mention it. Chopping firewood, boiling water, carrying water, sweeping the floor, making coal balls… Xiao Wen had to do all these things; while his parents were working, he could sneak in a little play; when they came back, he had to be busy with this and that. In the evening, when he had a little free time, there was no electricity, and since his parents had to go to work early the next morning, they were not willing to light an oil lamp, so they went to bed early. And they slept on a rock-hard wooden bed…</p>
<p>Why did the children in the pictures live such happy lives? —This didn't seem to be without reason. He often saw children outside who looked very similar to those in the pictures. But he himself was suffering. Could he blame his parents for being useless? But they were clearly often exhausted from their work, and just wanted to sleep when they came home. Not long ago, one time when only he and his father were at home, his father coughed for a while, and suddenly coughed up a few mouthfuls of yellow phlegm with blood. Because the light was dim at the time, his father didn't notice, but Xiao Wen, who was squatting on the ground chopping firewood, saw it and finally cried out in fear. His father bent down to take a look, shook his head, sighed, and then wiped the phlegm away with his foot, and then warned Xiao Wen not to tell his mother. He still spits up phlegm from time to time, but Xiao Wen has never seen his father go to a doctor or take any medicine. Although his father often beat him and scolded him, sometimes even beating his mother, often making his mother cry, when his father was not around, his mother often held him tightly, telling him with tears in her eyes not to hate his father because of this. He was really a very upright and knowledgeable person, extremely diligent, and didn't drink or smoke. It was only because he worked like a horse and a cow that he not only couldn't make a name for himself, but even living was becoming a problem, and his heart was extremely depressed, and his attitude had changed greatly. Xiao Wen also felt that his father was not a fierce person. When the landlord came to collect rent, or the lender came to demand payment, no matter how fierce or vicious they were, his father always tried his best to be careful and begged.</p>
<p>The more Xiao Wen thought about it, the more he couldn't understand it. A huge question mark was cutting into his fragile heart like an iron knife.</p>
<p>The two books slipped from his hands to the ground at this time, but Xiao Wen didn't feel it at all.</p>

<p>— Xiaofeng</p>
<p>"The love of a slave cannot blossom into a beautiful flower."</p>
<p>I remember these two lines from some song lyrics. At the time, after hearing them, many questions arose: Why wouldn't the love of a slave have beautiful blossoms? Aren't slaves also people? Also, what kind of people are slaves? At that time, in my naive heart, I couldn't really understand so much, so I didn't particularly like this song. When others sang it, the somber mood stimulated me, but honestly, I preferred lighter songs, those filled with exuberant emotions, that truly captivated me. I was immersed in such songs. I once sang loudly to the wilderness, under the soft moonlight, almost like a primal cry. But that was precisely a natural outpouring, humans are filled with so many emotions like joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, so humans sing for this reason, singing about what they love, and also singing about what they hate.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, quite some time has passed. I began to get closer to the noisy atmosphere, and jazz music accompanied me. Pure and sincere songs gradually left me, fading away in my memory. Some rough lyrics were also gradually forgotten. I learned affectation, and I also learned to sing some affected lyrics. Although this also contained a kind of beauty, it was a different kind of beauty. Beauty truly has many forms in the world. I pursued this kind of beauty, and I also pursued those other kinds of beauty. I also thought this was a kind of enjoyment; embracing and assimilating enriched me. I felt satisfied. I absorbed new forms of beauty while also discarding old ones.</p>
<p>Just like in the past, recently I listened to the ladies on the music scene twisting and wriggling as they sang, and I also listened to the low, melancholic chants carried by the wind on the lakeside. Sometimes I was excited and wanted to ask them something; sometimes I remained silent. However, I'll tell you, this is perfectly clear. In a quiet corner, I heard that long-forgotten song!</p>
<p>"The love of a slave cannot blossom into a beautiful flower."</p>
<p>Although the song's mood was still somber, it was clearly a sharp sound wave vibrating. I could imagine that it was a lively vocal cord emitting the sound. I was surprised, why not sing some bright lyrics?</p>
<p>Under the faint moonlight, behind that iron railing, the sound waves spread out from there. It was a girl, her hair sharply distinct in the darkness. She had no melancholy mood at all. I knew she had a cheerful heart. She was just humming casually, she didn't appreciate the somberness of the tune, she was just singing for fun.</p>
<p>I politely asked her, no, I almost interrogated her:</p>
<p>"Girl, based on your own experience... can you understand the love of a slave?"</p>
<p>After that, I learned a little more. She patiently told me a lot:</p>
<p>"A slave isn't necessarily a servant, nor necessarily a prisoner of war, nor necessarily those stories about slaves in history...</p>
<p>"As long as love is built on a foundation of money, it will not blossom into beautiful flowers and fruits."</p>
<p>"Why?" I still seemed to have some doubts. Every time the somber song resounded, the sharp sound waves echoed around me, and I was disturbed by this discordant song.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Spring <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Qi</p>
<p>A rumor was spreading in the Senior Year Two classroom at the Linzhong High School: Chen Shijia was pursuing Xu Meiwen.</p>
<p>When everyone talked about this rumor, they would unconsciously glance at Xu Meiwen in the front, and then sneak a peek at that guy in the suit in the back.</p>
<p>Xu Meiwen sat in the first row, so people behind could see her immediately. Xu Meiwen was currently copying from the algebra notebook of Huang Guifen, who was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>So, that Lao Ling showed disdain and curled his lips, saying:</p>
<p>"What's so great about Xu Meiwen? Copying algebra from others."</p>
<p>"Ah Q!" someone defended her. "You can't get her yourself, so you're just jealous."</p>
<p>Everyone burst into laughter. Then someone else turned around to look at Chen Shijia.</p>
<p>That guy in the suit was buried in a novel by Zhang Ziping, not hearing what others were saying. He was using all his energy to memorize the sentences. When he saw a female name, he would think of Xu Meiwen's dimples.</p>
<p>At this moment, he had just finished a short story, so he asked Fan Zhen next to him:</p>
<p>"Hey! Strategist! Do you think Zhang Ziping writes well?"</p>
<p>Here, it's necessary to introduce Fan Zhen. He was Chen Shijia's strategist and secretary. The letters Chen Shijia sent to female classmates were all taken care of by Fan Zhen. Therefore, that young master in the suit called the literary figure "Strategist."</p>
<p>Fan Zhen was a literary figure, so he naturally didn't take anything seriously.</p>
<p>"Zhang Ziping? Shh!" He smiled disdainfully. "It's always the same old thing."</p>
<p>Chen Shijia felt happy. He suddenly thought that those letters Fan Zhen wrote for him must be effective. But—</p>
<p>"But she still hasn't replied yet. -- It's been a week and three days."</p>
<p>"What's the rush?" The strategist comforted him. "Is everything in the world that easy?"</p>
<p>Indeed, nothing in the world is easy. Take his situation as an example. For that Xu Meiwen, how much thought and time had he spent? At first, he just followed her after school, following her to the entrance of the alley, watching Xu Meiwen go in. He stood there for a while, then came back. Then, he looked for opportunities to talk, but he didn't know how. Until now, he hadn't officially spoken a single word to her. Finally, the strategist taught him a trick: write a letter. However, it had been another week and three days with no reply.</p>
<p>"Xu Meiwen is actually so difficult?" Chen Shijia thought to himself.</p>
<p>However, only heaven knows. Xu Meiwen was not difficult at all. At this time, Xu Meiwen was thinking about her father's furious face:</p>
<p>"What is this?" The old man shouted loudly, clutching the five torn pieces of letters in his hand. "Although our family isn't doing so well now, we've always been a scholarly family for generations. I can't let people laugh at me for having no discipline!"</p>
<p>Xu Meiwen didn't know anything, not even who wrote them. But her father even limited her to reply within three days, but she didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Huang Guifen told her that people in the classroom were spreading "rumors" about her, so Xu Meiwen guessed half of the truth. Plus, in the past few days, people often liked to shout her name together with Chen Shijia's name, for example, Wang Jianzhang often shouted for no reason:</p>
<p>"Chen Shijia! Have you seen Xu Meiwen's composition book?"</p>
<p>Then everyone would burst into laughter again.</p>
<p>Chen Shijia had once very generously promised everyone that if things were successful, everyone would get to eat ten candies. Therefore, for the sake of ten candies, everyone hoped things would be successful.</p>
<p>Although there were also many people who were not very enthusiastic. Yu Cunzhi had said:</p>
<p>"Chen Shijia's way of love is wrong! This is a business transaction, a temporary impulse, not love!"</p>
<p>He could say what he wanted, but few people listened to him. As soon as Yu Cunzhi opened his mouth, it was all about common ideals, mutual encouragement, and so on, as if only he understood love.</p>
<p>"I advocate aestheticism," the literary figure Fan Zhen also expressed his opinion, "but it's also about the unity of body and soul, unlike Yu Cunzhi's common this and mutual that. Therefore, regarding Chen Shijia's matter, I hope to facilitate its realization in the shortest possible time. That's the key."</p>
<p>However, in the shortest possible time, nothing had been realized.</p>
<p>Everyone was eagerly waiting for those ten candies.</p>
<p>One day, Chen Shijia finally received a letter from Xu Meiwen.</p>
<p>It was very simple: My father recently tore up a letter, I believe it was written by you. To avoid future trouble for everyone, it's best to write fewer of these letters. Meiwen. Chen Shijia immediately went to find the strategist.</p>
<p>"This is called suppressing first and then promoting," the strategist said with a strategist's tone. "The art of war says, make the real seem illusory, and the illusory seem real. In my opinion, there's a lot of sense in this!"</p>
<p>"Stop putting on airs! What should we do now?"</p>
<p>"Act quickly. Be bold, and follow her to her house."</p>
<p>"Won't there be any danger?"</p>
<p>"Leave it to me." The strategist patted his chest.</p>
<p>However, Xu Meiwen didn't come that day, and she didn't come the next day either. Chen Shijia inquired and found out that she was sick.</p>
<p>The strategist had a flash of inspiration and came up with a plan.</p>
<p>"Old Chen! This time heaven has given you a great opportunity. You can walk into her house openly and honestly, saying that you're the representative of the entire class, coming to inquire about her illness."</p>
<p>Chen Shijia almost jumped up, and he wanted to hug Fan Zhen and shout a few times.</p>
<p>He bought a bunch of violets on the street, and the strategist sent him to the entrance of the alley. Then, five minutes later, Chen Shijia came out dejectedly.</p>
<p>"You hit a snag? Her father was home?" Fan Zhen looked at his face. "Stop the attack! I give up," the young master said dejectedly.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Then Chen Shijia told his strategist in detail. The first thing that caused his bad impression was that Xu Meiwen only lived in a kitchen shed, which was a mess with everything inside -- toilets, pots, everything was in there. Also, Xu Meiwen was drinking corn porridge, without even any side dishes.</p>
<p>"The room for the servants in our house is much cleaner than that!"</p>
<p>Secondly, Xu Meiwen didn't say a word to him, although her mother was still polite in entertaining him with a few words. This didn't matter. Xu Meiwen kept looking at a book, and Chen Shijia knew at a glance that the book belonged to Yu Cunzhi.</p>
<p>"I asked her, 'Did you borrow it from Cunzhi?' She grunted, 'Yes.' From beginning to end, I said this one sentence." "Yu Cunzhi has this trick too," the strategist said like a defeated warrior.</p>
<p>"So, I give up. Besides, just looking at that house is really unbearable."</p>
<p>The next day, Chen Shijia and others arrived at the school and spread rumors. "Hey! Did you know that Yu Cunzhi lent a lot of books to Xu Meiwen to read!"</p>
<p>This was naturally a new piece of news. Everyone went to ask Yu Cunzhi, and Yu Cunzhi didn't deny it at all.</p>
<p>"Lending books is just lending books, what's the big deal!"</p>
<p>"Good!" Some people shouted.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" The strategist Fan Zhen said: "Who doesn't know that using lending books as a guise."</p>
<p>"Yu Cunzhi! How many candies are you planning to give us each?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking nonsense about?" Yu Cunzhi blushed red. "Is lending books worth making such a fuss about?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you lend them to me then? Huh!" Chen Shijia found a reason.</p>
<p>"She borrowed them from me herself."</p>
<p>She went to borrow them from him herself! Chen Shijia's heart trembled. He thought: Why don't I have a book that I can lend to others? That's terrible. He, Chen Shijia, didn't have a single book. Even that novel by Zhang Ziping was borrowed from Fan Zhen.</p>
<p>"Chen Shijia! Don't be discouraged. Keep trying!" Someone cheered Chen Shijia on.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" He thought to himself: "I don't have any books, and I don't know how to say a lot of common whats and mutual whats to Xu Meiwen. What's the use of trying?"</p>
<p>He told this to the strategist Fan Zhen, and Fan Zhen said:</p>
<p>"You idiot! At this rate, you can forget about love for the rest of your life!"</p>
<p>Chen Shijia scratched his head and stared blankly at the strategist for a long time.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Prelude to the Sino-Portuguese Cup Final Next Tuesday <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The historic Sino-Portuguese Cup football match had a good record in the Shanghai football scene. However, since the incident, it has been silent, mainly because the authorities did not have the time for it. Until this year, the organization established by the authorities has been running smoothly, and there is a move to resume the Sino-Portuguese Cup football match, which has attracted the attention of football fans. The football skills of the Chinese and Portuguese armies always have their special appeal.</p>
<p>This year's cup competition still adopts the best-of-three system as in the past. The first game was played at Yiyuan Stadium on January 1, and the second game was held at the Racecourse on February 16. The former was New Year's Day, and the latter was the Lunar New Year's Day, which shows the authorities' special attention to this cup competition. However, after the second game, the two sides each won one game, and there was no follow-up for more than four months. All my fans think this is a strange thing. Until recently (21st), the authorities announced. This final battle has been decided to be held at the Racecourse Stadium at 5 pm next Tuesday (26th). There is a situation where it finally comes out after a thousand calls. Or is it that good dramas must arrive so late?</p>
<p>Before the competition, the author hopes that the Chinese team can win, so I dare to make a small contribution. But before discussing it, I plan to briefly supplement the situation of the first two games. The interval is long, and fans may have forgotten it, so even though it is past its prime, it can still be used as a reference.</p>
<p>The First Portuguese Victory</p>
<p>The competition was held in Yiyuan on January 1. Because it was a good time, the grand occasion was unprecedented. As a result, with a score of four to two, the Portuguese army won. In the process of scoring, China's Sun Jinshun took the lead and scored one goal, one to zero. The second goal was scored by Bao Xiutuo, one to one. The first half ended without a winner. In the second half, the first goal (the third goal) was scored by Su Ruomiao. The fourth goal, Han Longhai headed the ball into the net. The fifth goal was again scored by Su Ruo, and the sixth goal was scored by Bao Xiutuo. The total result was four to two, and the audience sighed. It was because the Chinese team was not complete that day, and many soldiers were absent. The lineup is recorded below.</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>V Su Ruo, Hu Pan, Victor Costa, W Pan, Tuo Sun Li, Aowei La, Bao Xiutuo, Mi Ke Lai Tuo, A Group Ke Sha Lai, Liao Fu En</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>(First Half) Liu Li, Ning Meng, Yang Liang, Sun Jinshun Xian, Zhang Lin, Gen Li Yichen, Han Wu Xiangqi, Zheng Yingquan, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>(Second Half)</p>
<p>Li Yao</p>
<p>Zhang Li Tiansheng, Meng Yiliang, Luo Shoufu Bang, Li Yichen, Sun Xiaoshun Lun, Zhang Lin, Gen Zheng Yingquan, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Second War China Wins Big</p>
<p>February 16 (Abolishing Lunar New Year's Day) confronted at the racecourse. As a result, China broke the Portuguese team with a score of five to zero. But in fact, the Portuguese team's lineup was sparse. Because of the cause of the Donghua athletes, the Chinese team did not participate, and it was not seen how strong it was. Therefore, the game did not have a very satisfactory battle situation. The scorers were Yu Liming, Li Yichen. At the end of the first half, Li Yichen, Li Yichen, Gao Xiuqing. The lineup for the day is as follows.</p>
<p>China vs. Team</p>
<p>Portugal, Zhou Qilin, Yu Li, painted Gao Xiuqing, Dong Li Tiansheng Shi Meng, Liang Gao Baozheng, Jie Wu Qixiang (top) Yu Liming Yu Liming (top) (bottom) Lei Shihua</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>Greenburg, Bolag, Kema, Han V Su Ruo, Sha Ke Lai Tuo Lai Yuan A, Klasha Bolayuan</p>
<p>The Third Silver Cup Decision</p>
<p>This sudden final battle has been scheduled for next Tuesday. Based on the situation of the players in recent days, it may not be possible to have the most normal state, so I dare not make a judgment on whether the performance will be wonderful. Only because this game is decisive, it is better to do it for real. The author is in the position of the press and has to talk about preparing for a rainy day. If it is really urgent, it is better than not talking about it, and I hope to win the silver cup. In the history of the ball, it cannot be changed. It is better to first review the Portuguese team's lineup. Although there may be changes, the most ideal one is the following:</p>
<p>Costa, V Su Ruo, Pan Victor, Tai W Pan, Sun Li, Aolie, Wei La Bao Xiutuo, Lai Ke Lai Tuo Lai Yuan</p>
<p>A Kelasha, Fu En</p>
<p>According to the above lineup, the tactical speculation of the Portuguese team is made. Even if its lineup is slightly adjusted, its combat strategy is roughly the same. Because the style of the Portuguese team is always like this. Its defenders, in addition to trying their best to block the enemy's wings, often use the trick of tempting people to offside to save energy. The two midfielders must follow the ball between the enemy's abundant. The central defender sits in the center, and at the same time, he is the rear, and his guard pattern is almost visible. On the front line, it focuses on the method of flying wings and central breakthrough. Among them, the two inside forwards retreat most of the time to serve as seven defenders to fight and carry the ball to the front line.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the Chinese team should prescribe the right medicine to achieve the effect of defeating the enemy. First, it may be necessary to propose a corresponding lineup. With Sun Jinshun's recent departure from Shanghai, Li Biao Qu Yongfu's injury, and Li Yichen's recent poor condition, there is a feeling of lack of talent on the front line. Looking for the next best thing, let's propose it like this.</p>
<p>Song Lingsheng, Liu Zuru, Zhang Wu Qixiang Luo Shoufu Bang, Xin Fuzhen, Dai Linjing Lun, Zhang Lin, Gen Han Longhai</p>
<p>Meng Yiliang, Jia Youliang (new force) Liu Xianhan, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Yu Liming, etc.</p>
<p>According to the proposed lineup, the midfielders and defenders have plenty of strength and rich experience. To block the team's two amazing activities can be competent. The two midfielders are also able to have the ability to carry the ball to help the offensive. Even more valuable is that the above five forwards should be the most reasonable ideal at the moment. Liu Guru is in very good condition recently and can be competent. Dai Linjing's center forward is indispensable, because of the strength of even Fan. Han Longhai has a fierce rush, which can be used to use the opponent's intention to use the trick of tempting the enemy offside, and it is extremely possible to rush into building power. This is to fight poison with poison. Jia Youliang has not only not retreated recently, but also has a good state, so his cut ball must have wonderful moves. Liu Zuru on the left wing is quite capable, so he can show his skills from it. As for the reason why the goalkeeper Chong Zhang Banglun, Yu is rather that Liu Xianhan may have a sense of rawness. From the point of view of Zhang's two results in the Baima team, he is still satisfactory.</p>
<p>The author is talking about soldiers on paper and is in the position of an observer, making sincere comments. I don't know if it can invite the authorities to look forward to it and adopt it?</p>
<h3 id="e55">Prelude to Summer Football League War <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Shuang Dai</p>
<p>The Football Association has ended this football season, and as summer approaches, it will hold a summer football invitational tournament. The initial preparation was for six strong teams, Dong, Friendship. Overseas Chinese Association, Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, Warren, Shanghai Police. Now I hear that Donghua has decided not to participate. So there are only five teams. This matter has been brewing for a long time, and it can become a reality when the Football Association is in progress. Then in this summer, the people of Shanghai can still enjoy the football players galloping on the court, which is an unexpected blessing.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Football Association to open the football league is to enable players to have a chance to connect in the summer, not to be unfamiliar, and to have a skilled performance in the morning light of the next game, so that the level has the possibility of improvement. This method cannot be said to be inappropriate. However, I think it may be too bitter for the ball, but the Warren and Shanghai Police teams can be said to be two newly organized teams. The former is the overlord of Group C this year, and the latter was once rumored to have disintegrated. The former has drawn in famous players, and the latter has tried to make adjustments. So the two teams have become quite considerable.</p>
<p>Now the news has come that the two teams have scheduled a friendly match at Jiaozhou Park at 5:30 this afternoon (23rd). This may be the so-called prelude to the summer football league, and it is also an opportunity for these two new armies to give us an estimate. Whether the summer football league has appeal has a great relationship with the Taoism game.</p>
<p>The reporter once visited Warren Changju for an interview. According to Yao Naizhi, the person in charge, their team has gathered famous players from De Shangqiao Lian Huatong and other teams this time, and their strength is quite strong. However, coming from various teams, it is inevitable that there is a suspicion of being a rabble, so he invited the famous instructor Ma Shan'er to serve as an instructor. He uses his best teaching methods, just like printing well-filled lecture notes, and he goes to the venue every day to explain in detail according to the pictures. Really, it gives each player the opportunity to understand the ball path the most. Therefore, although they are soldiers gathered from various teams, they already have a good tacit understanding. When the time comes, I really dare not guarantee how good the results will be, but what can be guaranteed is that it will never be as bad as generally imagined.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police, because people like Robert Cotov Yuzhenghua left, it was rumored that it would disband at the end of the season, which made many fans regret it. This time, being able to make a comeback is enough to excite fans a little. They selected good materials from Group B and drew in a few pillars from the Jewish team, so the whole team is neat and average enough. What is worrying is whether there will be the best performance on the stage.</p>
<p>Today, I hope the boss blesses, don't rain, then, the Taoism friendship competition must be a ball game that fans are eager to watch. It is even more hoped by the Football Association that it will become a game and at least observe the strength of these two new armies to make a budget for the Summer Football League. Now explore and record the military appearance of the Warren Shanghai Police teams:</p>
<p>Warren</p>
<p>Lang Shaoshan Bao Di, Luo Di, Newburg, Parker, Chen Xiaoping, Liu Zuru, Ting Mite, Lin Jiazheng</p>
<p>Wang Chunjiang, Pollyhuo</p>
<p>Shanghai Police</p>
<p>En's Biff Ololov, Lei Fan, Lohan, Yuan Yintian, Wheat, Li Xifa, Van Meilongwen, Que Qilin, Mi Hailov, Yu Liming</p>
<h3 id="e56">Volleyball League First Division Championship - Zhongbei Individual Techniques <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— (Jie)</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain this week, many volleyball league matches have been rescheduled. No matches were completed in the women's first division, creating an irreparable regret. Last week, I introduced the women's division champion, the Three Provinces team. Now, let's introduce the Zhongbei team, which has secured the first division championship. Looking at Zhongbei's schedule, only one match against the White team remains, while all other teams have at least two losses. Therefore, even if Zhongbei loses to the White team, it will not affect their championship title. Here is an individual introduction of each player in order.</p>
<p>Team Leader and Captain Wang</p>
<p>Zhu Zhongtao is the team leader and captain. As the name suggests, he is known to be a man of both words and action. Listening to his pre- and post-match talks to the team, they are indeed insightful. He also occasionally takes to the field, trying the position of left front. Observing his skills, it is clear that he is a veteran player. However, due to a lack of practice, his jumping block and spike can only be maintained for a short time. Afterwards, it becomes apparent that he cannot jump as high, and his elasticity is insufficient.</p>
<p>Right Front Li Baocheng</p>
<p>Li is tall and has excellent elasticity. His signature move is a perfectly timed and skillfully placed spike when jumping. Neither too strong nor too gentle, its landing point is unpredictable. Moreover, due to its speed, the opposing team cannot defend against it. Li Baocheng was well-known for this skill in the north, and it is no wonder that his agile movements captivate fans in Shanghai. However, his serve lacks unique success, which is a minor flaw. Middle Front Mai Bingyao</p>
<p>The middle front's skills should focus on setting and blocking. Mai excels in both of these areas. He has a long-standing reputation in volleyball. Watching his skillful sets, one only needs a few practice sessions with him to receive the most appropriate ball. His setting skills have reached a refined state. Although Mai is not very tall, his timing when blocking is also accurate. Furthermore, Mai sometimes makes a surprise backhand flick, but his serve is not worth mentioning. In fact, he often serves the ball into the net, leaving people wondering why he cannot improve.</p>
<p>Left Front Chen Xuechong</p>
<p>Some believe that Chen Xuechong is a newcomer to volleyball, but this is not the case. It is said that when he studied in Beiping (Beijing), his interest and skills in volleyball were greater than in basketball. Chen's jumping ability is well-known to fans. Because of this, he can jump high, and his strength is sufficient. Therefore, his spikes are fast and powerful. The opposing team finds it difficult to block his high shots, and it is even harder to save them. He and Li Baocheng are the main scorers on the left and right front. Because of his jumping ability and strength, his blocking is also effective.</p>
<p>Right Back Zhao Yalin</p>
<p>Zhao is considered the only newcomer in this year's first division teams. However, in fact, Zhao's volleyball reputation in the north is well-known. While in the north, Zhao played in the front row. This time, due to team composition, he is trying the right back position, leading some to criticize the use of talent in a lower position. Unexpectedly, his first attempt revealed a powerful spike, unstoppable and fierce. This shows his mastery of volleyball. He also uses his quick mind to perform surprising saves, truly a natural talent.</p>
<p>Middle Back Hou Ruoyu</p>
<p>Those in the middle back position must be able to save and receive the ball, as well as make accurate passes. Since they have the most opportunities to get the ball due to their position, their passes must be able to supply the middle front for attacking opportunities. Hou Ruoyu has a good sense of passing the ball. However, Hou's agility in defending against enemy balls has diminished compared to the past. Perhaps due to increasing responsibilities, his diving is not as good as before. Hou sometimes makes a powerful spike, but it is often inaccurate and lacks precision. Overall, he is still a valuable player.</p>
<p>Left Back Yuan Bingqiu</p>
<p>Yuan is very thin, and some may think that he cannot make powerful spikes. However, Yuan's spikes are not only powerful but also accurate. He does not make frivolous attempts, which is commendable. In our memory, Yuan has consistently maintained his superior position in the volleyball scene, maintaining a normal state of composure and humility. Yuan has a very clear mind. Sometimes, when the opponent blocks effectively, he will make a lob over their heads. This may come from experience. Yuan and Zhao are the main scorers on the two sides of the back row.</p>
<p>Right Third Row Zheng Jichang</p>
<p>Zheng excels in boxing, so his powerful spikes are self-evident. He also has a good understanding of volleyball. In the third row, he has the quickest reach and a willingness to dive, so he can make amazing saves from seemingly impossible situations. His serve is also remarkable. Combined with his strength and experience, he can be described as a talented player in the third row.</p>
<p>Middle Third Row Huang Yaohua</p>
<p>Huang Yaohua is the most popular volleyball player in recent years. Huang's saves are not only practical but also aesthetically pleasing. When saving a difficult ball, he always lets out a loud shout. As soon as the sound comes out, the ball has already been saved in his hands. Due to these reasons, he is particularly appealing to the audience. Moreover, his serve is excellent, arguably the best in Shanghai, which is another reason for his popularity.</p>
<p>Left Third Row Chen Zhaobang</p>
<p>Chen, Zheng Jichang, and Huang Yaohua were previously on the same team, forming the most coordinated third row. Chen is the most stable of the three, but his skills are not much different from Zheng and Huang. However, he seems heavier, so he rarely dives to save the ball. His serving skills are also above average. These three players in the third row can be considered the best in Shanghai. As for Ma Canxi, Yu Xunshi, Zhuo Guorong, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, and others, they have fewer opportunities to play due to other commitments or a willingness to give way to others. Therefore, we will have to omit them.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Softball League: Sino-Philippine War Tomorrow - Panda Team Shows Their Skills <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Miao</p>
<p>In this year's softball league, the Chinese Panda team was originally scheduled to have their debut match against the Samurai team on Tuesday (19th), but it was postponed due to rain and wet ground. Tomorrow (24th), Sunday morning at 10:00 AM, the Pandas will face the Philippine community team at the Tongxing Field (intersection of Route Lory and Avenue Haig in the former French Concession). Recalling last year, the Pandas, after an extremely hard-fought battle, narrowly defeated the Philippine community team by only one point. Therefore, tomorrow's match, with the two strong teams meeting again, will undoubtedly be exciting. Fans should not miss it!</p>
<p>Skills Are Similar</p>
<p>From a defensive standpoint, the two teams' skills are actually similar, especially the outfielders, who are good at catching high balls. However, the Panda team is slightly better at infield defense. In terms of shortstop, Liang Yousheng of the Chinese team sits at the gate, and any ball hit will be caught by him. Moreover, the Panda team's infielders cooperate smoothly, and they are skilled at covering and double plays. Wen Ruixiong, the third baseman, throws the ball from his wrist, and no base runner can outrun it, no matter how fast. Therefore, tomorrow, fans can enjoy the Chinese team's excellent infield skills. The Philippine team's defensive weakness lies in the second and third basemen. Their shortstop is also very mediocre, but the first baseman and catcher, Tang Qiaosilang, are quite prepared. The Chinese team should be careful when stealing bases, paying attention to Tang Qiaosilang's throws. At the same time, do not swing too early at pitcher Taishan's pitches, because his pitches are mostly soft and low. The Chinese players should be careful when swinging to avoid being tricked.</p>
<p>Score Will Be Very Close</p>
<p>The outcome of tomorrow's match will be very close. Why? Because the Chinese team's weakness is in offense, while the Philippine team's weakness is in defense. Therefore, when the Chinese team hits, they should not hit high balls. The best shots are low balls hit between the second and third basemen. Whether the Panda players can control this well is a question. According to Japanese and American baseball teams, the direction and distance of hitting are also part of the strategy. For example, in a full base situation, a high ball should be hit to the left outfield; when there is a runner on third base, a bunt should be used. Japanese and American baseball players swing their bats as they wish, observing the situation and adapting accordingly. The Chinese players' hitting has not yet reached perfection. Few can hit home runs. I have observed that the Panda team spends a lot of energy on defensive skills and neglects batting practice. I hope Mr. Liang will pay attention to this. No matter how skillful the defense is, if there is no way to attack, it is in vain. When selecting players, avoid emphasizing defensive skills and select more players who can hit the ball, so that offense and defense are balanced, and the chance of scoring is higher. I remember last year when the Portuguese Commercial team played against the Philippine community team, the Philippine team was still leading by one point until the final inning. Fortunately, the Portuguese team was good at hitting, and in the last inning, Tang Bala's home run secured the final victory. This is a good reference for the Chinese team.</p>
<p>Chinese Team Should Use Hitting</p>
<p>In short, if the Chinese team can use hitting in tomorrow's match, victory can be expected. The reason they won against the Philippine team last year was only because the Philippine first baseman dropped a catch, allowing Liang Yousheng (the only runner on base in that game) to return to home and score one point.</p>
<p>The Panda team's lineup for tomorrow's match:</p>
<p>Catcher: Wang Xiushan, Huang Yingrui. Pitcher: Li Qisheng. First base: Wang Nianzu. Second base: Wen Tianhua. Third base: Wen Ruixiong. Shortstop: Liang Yousheng. Center field: Liang Youwen. Left field: Tang Weiye. Center field: Wang Nianzi. Right field: Zhong Baoluo, Liang Youyi. It is said that the Philippine team is preparing to avenge their previous defeat. The Chinese team should do their best to defeat them.</p>

<h3 id="e59">My Views on the Revision of the Rules of Round-Gate Ball (1) <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Di Xianzhang</p>
<p>Round-gate ball is a ball game created by Qian Jun Xucang. Since 1941, it has gradually become popular after a series of exhibition matches, friendly matches, and cup matches. Round-gate ball collects the advantages of basketball, football, German handball, and water polo, and develops from them. By careful consideration, taking the best and discarding the worst, it has become what it is today. The teams participating in the cup matches are not only teams organized by Chinese people, but also those from foreign countries. This proves that round-gate ball is beneficial to physical fitness. It is hoped that people in the sports world at home and abroad will promote it, so that round-gate ball matches can be held not only in China, but also in any corner of the world. This will add a lot of glory to the Chinese people in the history of sports.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1941, in a round-gate ball demonstration match, Mr. Qian Buqun invited me and Mr. Yu Juefei to serve as referees. At that time, the rules used were based on Mr. Qian's personal rules. During the match, the players' skills in round-gate ball were still experimental, and there were not many highlights, but there were also no obvious flaws. After several matches, the rules were found to be inadequate, and Mr. Qian repeatedly revised the original rules in each cup match. As a result, the rules of round-gate ball gradually became perfect, which is a fortunate thing. Now, I will list and explain the items that have been added and changed, and add my own humble opinions, hoping that experts will forgive my inappropriateness.</p>
<p>The rules of all ball games are based on the principle of equal benefits. The rules of round-gate ball are of course no exception. In addition, the rules of any ball game have been revised and amended several or dozens of times before they are perfected.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Number of Players <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>According to the original rules drafted by Mr. Qian in the first demonstration match, Chapter 5, Article 1 of the Ball Team, "Each team should have six players (one goalkeeper, one center forward, one left and one right forward, one left and one right defender)...", six players were present. However, at that time, because it was an experimental nature, the players' skills were not pure, so it was slack, and it was impossible to have an exciting performance in the game; therefore, in the second demonstration match, one center defender was added, and considerable achievements were obtained. Since then, it has been stipulated that the number of players is seven. Furthermore, the original text of Article 3 of Chapter 5 of the Ball Team: "Each team must have at least five players, and any team with less than five players shall not start the game" should also be changed to "Each team must have at least six players, and any team with less than six players shall not start the game."
