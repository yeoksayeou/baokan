<h3>懷仁堂招待中外來賓　主席夫婦舉行茶會　對士紳耆宿慰勉有加</h3>
<p>「中央社北平十五日電〕蔣主席偕夫人於十五日下午四時，在懷仁堂舉行盛大茶會，招待中外來賓，到平津士紳耆宿斬雲鵬·張作相·朱啓鈐·谷鍾秀·潘齊畢·王樹常·于珍等，敎育界陳垣·李玉　·陸志章·王桐齡·左宗綸·余棨昌·石志泉·苗羣代表丹巴達札·葛必達達哈爾巴夫婦，宗敎代表常子春·司格脫等，婦女界周梁令嫻等，新聞界成舍我·曹谷沙等，及美聯·合衆·路透·時代·生活雜誌·紐約時報·芝加哥新報記者，參政員莫德惠·饒鳳璜，工商嚴及學生代表楊紹業等，美軍駐平津長官洛基將軍·瓊斯將軍·華登將軍，及盟國駐平外交人員等二百六十餘人。主席偕夫人於四時徐步入塲，全體熱烈歡迎，掌聲震耳。席中主席親至各席，與高齡耆宿，一一握手，埀問健康。返座後，含笑致詞，對華北父老同胞，與各界人士八年來在敵偽壓迫之下，困苦艱難，堅貞不屈，備致質揚，以為此種精神，實足以代表民族之正氣，而爲我抗戰勝利之保障。並盼大家一本過去之精神，領導同胞，輔助政府，以完成建國之大業。詞畢，全體一致鼓掌。斬雲鵬先生起立答詞，以爲今日之茶會，爲歷史上之盛會，國家在過去十餘年中，賴蔣主席之英明領導，始克戰勝強敵，奠定國基。然建國大業，方當開始，但望主席繼續領導中國三十年。（衆大鼓掌）全國上下，固心協力，埋頭苦幹，則三十年後，我中國必可成爲現代化之國家。茶會於五時許盡歡而散。主席及夫人一一與來賓握手道別。溯自主席上次離平，在民國廿四年，迄今十載。抗戰以後，平津淪陷，父老處水深火熱之中，望主席之蒞臨，有如大旱之望雲霓。今茲抗戰勝利，主席首光蒞平，民心之振奮可想。故此次承主席與夫人招待之士紳耆宿，莫不異常興奮。七十高齡靳新雲先生，原住天津，聞主席之召，即日由津飛平，終於四時許趕至會場，與主席相見，且引為莫大之榮幸。越徵華北父老同胞，對於主席之愛戴。</p>
<h3>東北問題極樂觀　美報謂美蘇已有深切認識　蔣主席今晨在平檢閱美軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十四日合衆電〕紐約時報社論評中國軍隊抵達長春，潘陽，及　蔣主席蒞臨北平等事日；中國政府此種勝利，非常重要，蓋重要之處，在不流血之勝利也。凡此事件，均使中國之統一團結機會，大爲增强。最後更重要者，即證明蘇美兩國，俱已深切認識中國之情勢，此不特有裨於消除中國內戰，且使遠東問題，有解決之望。而遠東之和平，亦將獲得保陣。中國政府推展之速，大部因受美蘇兩國之協助所致。該報結論謂：美蘇兩國在遠東所採軍事行動之並行，實爲莫斯科三國外長會議樂觀之朕兆。蓋中國之問題，能和洽解決，則最近引起各方猜疑誤會之其他問題，亦能從而商決。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山十五日廣播稱：紐約泰晤士報駐華特派員李勃曼，頃發表蔣委員長蒞平後之一切實况，其言有云：『蔣委員長蒞平，其主要目的有二：（一）與各領袖商討東北問題，（二）處罰一切違法之接收官員。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十五日電〕蔣主席與夫人在此，除各十字路口有兩個士兵站崗外，並無其他特殊警衛處置。街上交通，亦從未稍阻。明晨美駐華海軍部隊遊行時，主席夫婦將參加檢閱，並對有功美軍面授勳章。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕北平市商會整委會，以北平爲我國歷代古都，文物薈萃，水陸交通便利，奠都北平必可爲建國復興之基礎，特由該委會委員代表孫錫三等十七人，具文呈請　蔣主席，陳述建都北平之意見，請求採納。</p>
<h3>蔣經國等晤杜聿明　中蘇軍掃防事有圓滿結果　張嘉璈在長春宴蘇方要員</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州十五日電〕蔣經國，陳良，楊綿仲等，十五日晨自平來錦，晤社聿明，就各主管業務，分別舉行會商。由蔣主持之中蘇軍接防會商事宜，有圓滿結果。由長官部分派上中校三人，譯員三人，爲潘陽赤峯早新三連絡組，人選已內定。交蔣携長春，商得蘇方同意後，即可開始進行。正午杜氏設宴，爲蔣等洗塵。下午一時，蔣等原機逕飛長春。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕張嘉璈定十五日下午七時，在官邸宴客。被邀者有蘇軍參謀長特諾曾科中將，馬林諾夫斯基元帥之經濟顧問斯拉特果夫斯基上校，長春鐵路副理事長喀爽根中將，助理副理事長瑪里意，理事業夫斯基湼夫少校，茲洛夫，監事長萊瓦紹夫，監事李芳諾夫，及蔣經國，董彥平，李則芬，邱行湘，長鐵助理理事長王澂，理事萬異，人事處長朱新民，總務處長耿匡。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕中央銀行在此設行事宜，刻正積極籌備中，不日即可正式開業。同時並發行東北九省流通券，該券分一元，五元，十元，五十元，百元五種。所有前僞滿發行之紙幣，在實行收回前，准予等價使用。行營經濟委員會即將頒發第一號佈吿，昭吿此事。又此間銀行開業者，已有四家，計中國，交通，及益發，功成兩商業銀行。各行現僅辦理存款業務。中國銀行開業未及兩月，已收存款兩千餘萬。中農銀行將來擬接收此間之興農金庫合作社等機構，並在此設行。</p>
<h3>傳作義由綏抵平　謁蔣主席報告綏包情況　對共產軍稱亂表示痛心</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕（遲到）傳長官作義，十三日下午三時由歸綏飛平，當晚即晋謁蔣主席，報吿綏包苦戰經過。傳氏在此略事勾留，即行返綏。十四日傳氏接見本報記者，據談：敵人投降後，本人率軍疾進，八月廿七日即已行軍二千餘里，到達大同，平綏交通迅吿恢復，敵軍繳械工作，亦迅速完成。全綏國民方慶從此可獲休養生息，熟知毫無理由之內亂起矣。今綏包兩城經月餘之苦戰，雖幸吿無恙，而作義（傳氏　稱）之衷心實痛苦萬分。過去對日作戰時，作義每睹斷股裂膚之受傷弟兄，皆壯其忠勇，不稍悲傷，今日一見受傷弟兄，作義即淚如泉湧，悲不自勝，蓋彼等大好男兒之血，實不應如此流也。今政治協商會議開會在即，深望能討論出一好辦法，不要作閱牆之爭，苦我人民。綏包經此次戰事後，業已破壞不堪，鐵路幾全被拆除，電綫桿被共軍拔充雲梯，農村壯丁多被擄去，糧食亦被搶掠一空，將來即使共軍退去，恢復原狀亦非易事。</p>
<h3>傳賀龍陣亡　魯省滕縣激戰</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平十五日電〕據天主敎所辦晨報「益世報」載緩遠來客談，共軍重要將領之一賀龍，於數日前共軍進攻歸綏時陣亡</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十四日電〕包頭市民絕食者甚衆，國軍已盡力將包頭以西共軍驅除，而打通由包頭至綏西交通，運輸食糧救濟，刻綏西至包頭間交通，已暢通無阻。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶十五日電〕山西省共產軍四師，有發動猛攻之勢，中央軍已在該省南部密佈地雷，以資防備。山東省博山一帶，亦有共產軍大舉進攻。</p>
<p>〔中央社魯南某地十五日急電〕集結滕縣附近之共軍主力，十三日起已將城垣包圍，迄十四日午止，仍在慘烈激戰中。</p>
<h3>在京參政員　提四項建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕在京參政員，曾召開第一次談話會，到王啓江，馬景常等，次議致電邵秘畏力子曁駐會參政會同人，提供意見四項：（一）請即派遣民意機關代表，會同地方公正士紳，參加接收工作，其有貪汚嫌疑者，嚴予澈查公布。（二）共黨蓄意破壞民族國家，實爲國民公敵應加以制裁。（三）抗戰殉難先烈及其遺族，應予表揚撫卹，實際參加抗戰有功人員，應加實獎勵。（四）已逮捕之首要漢奸，宜迅速在首都公開審判，依叛國罪從嚴處分。</p>
<h3>還都到京人員　明日開始辦公</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕十八日行政院例會，因宋院長未到，恐不克在京舉行。又京市府黨部正籌備歡迎還都人員。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕第一批政院各機關部份還都辦公人員，已全部到齊，定十七日起正式開始辦公，渠等因各部均統籌食宿，故雖多隻身來此，而生活則彌感安適。鐵道部之巍峨大廈，刻有糧食·社會·農林·交通及政院本部人員集中辦公，其他財政·經濟·外交·敎育四部及蒙藏，僑務兩委會，亦分別遷入原址及新址。政院方面人士，拒絕證實十八日政院例會將在京舉行說，惟說明渠等仍在作此準備。據記者所悉，交次凌鴻勛，農次錢天鶴等，將於日內來京，今後並長期駐京，主持各部務。</p>
<h3>南京淸查戶口　經過情形良好</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕京市戶口總淸查第一日（十五），市府警察局出動戶籍員警四六〇名，分一四九組分區工作，憲兵亦協助進行，經過情形良好。</p>
<h3>商震等給予勳章　國府昨明令褒揚梁鐘亭</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕國府十二月十五日令：（一）商震給予靑天白日勳章，陳布雷，陳果夫各給予一等雲麾勛章，蕭贊育給予二等寳鼎勛章，兪濟時，馮聖法各給予二等雲麾勛章，楊錦昱，施覺民各給予三等雲麾勛章，唐縱，趙桂森各給予三等賓鼎勛章，黎鐵漢給予四等寳鼎勛章，此令。（二）行政院呈，據山東省政府電稱，專員梁鍾亭因公殉職，殊堪矜式，轉請鑒核，明令褒揚等情，查該專員保衛地方，　難殞命，深堪悼惜，應予明令褒揚，用彰忠烈，此令。</p>
<h3>專機赴延安　接共黨代表</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十五日電〕今日政府派專機兩架，赴延安接共產黨代表來渝，參加政治協商會議。共產黨駐渝辦事處證實此點，但對周恩來是否於星期日或星期一來渝，則不能確定。衆料共產黨代表團人數約在三十人左右，目下正爲彼等尋覓房舍中。</p>
<h3>天堂行</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>東方威尼斯掠影</p>
<p>每天走過四川路中國旅行社門前，看到那留着一人寬的鐵柵欄門，外面擁擠蒲成大堆人羣在呌囂嘶喊，心頭總有些不自在。我頗驚異於人們這樣熱中於旅行。</p>
<p>京滬車確實是比九月初間改善了，那時，運車頂上都坐有人，人們進出是用車窗的。一到車站，像一陣黑旋風似的，幾百個手提包袱的壯漢竄蹦而出。現在我們看不到這生龍活虎的塲面了。</p>
<p>在車上，有位老者說他用一千五百元買了張到蘇州的二等車票，他並不覺得懊喪，他連喊「難得知得」！「想不到」！因爲他得到一個座位，得舒徐地可以坐到蘇州。多出幾個錢也求得了一點安逸。</p>
<p>有兩個動務兵模樣的人物，佔了八隻位子，找不到座的人問他們，都被「有人」兩個字頂回去了，這些人中偶有一兩個氣憤地說：「火車上還定座嗎」？回答是「老子就定座」！這時，有魯仲連之類人物出來排解，魯仲運們怕定座者眞動火，在旁喫着流彈，未免寃枉。車子快開時，才來了兩位軍官，餘下來四個座位，兩個立刻被人坐去，兩個上面放着公事包。而立在這節車廂裏的至少有十五人。我冷眼旁觀，我贊佩兩位甘地主義者，他們向那位軍官滿求被拒絕後並不灰心，他們就站在那放公事包的座位　，一聲不響，車開動了，那位軍官搭訕地自動將公事包拿開，甘地主義者沉默地一屁股坐下，瞧也不瞧一眼</p>
<p>這一天，正是蘇州的人力車夫爲了車主增加車租而罷工，從平門外車站走進城已很喫力。如果有行李，那就更麻煩了。寥寥的幾部馬車乘機抬價，還有幾輛貼着機關名稱或軍用車的紙條約小汽車，偶爾也做做野雞生意</p>
<p>日本兵騎着高頭大馬在路上蹓達，樣子像在踏靑。</p>
<p>我們的軍官，甚至縣保安隊的一個小隊長，後面都跟着上個掛盒子砲的「馬升」，軍官掏出烟捲，「馬弁」立刻擦洋火，走在路上，緊張萬分，幾乎把每一個行路人都當作刺客盒子砲隨時要拔出來一般。我心裘想：眞威風！</p>
<p>間門外更繁榮。我在默念着！</p>
<p>淡淡長流水，悠悠遠客情；落花皆有意，墮地也無聲。</p>
<p>「蘇州夜話」中的情緒，深深地感染我。</p>
<p>不僅　門外一處了，現在的觀前也呈現着空前繁榮。新開了十幾家菜館，飯店也够富麗堂皇。在淪陷區間，這裏是不夜天；抗戰勝利後，兩三個月來，也照樣燈紅酒綠，其中還有若千是過去的主人，不過換了證章符號而已。</p>
<p>許多小街，許多深巷，那種死的靜寂使人覺得寒冷，八年的淪陷歲月，更看出這城子的被壓榨，被剝削，溫柔的吳儂之家，顯得越發溫柔，越發樂火知命隨遇而安了。</p>
<p>也許是鄰近上海的關係，大都市呑併小縣城，勞力向都市集中，即使女子也不例外。我的親戚家雇不到女仙，據說，年輕的都走上海，賸下來的全是五十歲以上的老太婆。</p>
<p>雜色部隊這一帶散游得最多，在茶館酒店三三兩兩的談論這一類的故事，勒索哪，搶刦哪，就在軍站對門的小飯鋪，我還聽到搶幾十隻鴨子的一件訟案</p>
<p>如果說這個城子還點生氣的話，那就是這兩大滿街滿巷貼着的「歡迎XXX」……的紅綠標語。</p>
<p>充滿了憂　感和殺伐氣，我很難找出事實證明這是天堂，這是東方威尼斯。　十二月十四日</p>
<h3>徐州設市　駱東藩任市長</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州十五日電〕徐州設市，蘇有府已奉行政院核准，並發表駱東藩任市長，駱氏在鎭江公畢，十四日晚搭車抵徐，聞已着手籌備，市府約明年元旦可成立。</p>
<h3>日俘修公路　共分四區進行</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十五日電〕交通界息，最高經濟委會前議決，利用日俘修復公路一案，交部已擬定詳細計劃，呈經核定，茲誌其修復路綫如下：（一）京滬區：計有京杭·京滬·滬杭·杭嵊·宣長五綫，共一一二一公里。（二）武漢區：計有武長·漢宜·南潯·洛汴四綫，共一一八九公里。（三）平津區：計有津汴·平塘·平承·通山四綫，共一二一一公里。（四）廣東區：計有廣廉·廉海·廣揭三綫，共一三〇一公里，以上共計四八二二公里。估需日俘廿一萬另九百人，其中京滬·京杭·武長三綫，已由軍事當局調集日俘先行搶修，其餘各綫亦將陸續開工。</p>
<h3>平逮捕二批漢奸　已改編偽軍官二人在內</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕平市開始逮捕第二批漢奸，被捕者有前僞豫省長邵文凱，偽冀省長吳贊周，偽情報局長林文龍，僞禁烟局長萬兆芝，偽北平敎育會長羅慶山，僞北平綏署軍學局長王斌，僞淸河軍校校長秦華，僞綏靖軍第四集團司令田申，第七集團司令趙晋三，偽綏靖軍副官處長文大可，軍需處長喬世臨等多人。其中特値注意者，爲此次逮捕漢奸範圍已擴展及山偽軍改編之現役軍人，如王斌現任新編第九路參謀長，文大可任副官處長，當局警奸決心，於此可見。</p>
<h3>對華救濟積極進行　擬用款六萬七千五百萬美元　美總統再簽署鉅額捐款法案</h3>

<h3>裕仁已成孤皇　五百戰犯即將開審　絞刊台上新置巨索</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十四日專電〕自吾人首席抵達日本本土後三個半月中，日皇裕仁乃一孤立抑鬰之人物，一如飽受砲火洗禮，屹立於東京敗瓦頹垣中之古樹。此一度號稱帝國之日本，乃一孤立無援截肢斷足之負像而已。裕仁遜位與否，固置弗論，然其處境之江河日下，則可斷言。目下渠與一般日人業已隔離，若干日人對於此「神不可侵犯」之觀念，規定鼓勵提出查問此事，實開日本歷史之先例。渠手下與民間保持聯絡之三大人物近衛·木戶·及平沼均已離宮遠入囹圄，其碩果僅存與民間接觸之內閣，亦已荏弱無力，電奄一息。麥帥業已凍結日皇及皇族之大批資產，以是日皇之特權亦加限制。盟軍統帥部對裕仁所施威脅，一如處置財閥然。戰爭稅捐之徵收，將使裕仁淪為貧民，即其一己之耕田，按照新訂之農田改革法，亦將售與一般農夫。此外麥帥即擬下令制止日政府對於神道教之支持，並將廢止其特權。</p>
<p>日本守成人士記為日皇雖居御座，然其繫獄之可能性反大，由於麥帥逮捕皇族初本宮之手令，業將日本人民所抱皇族血系，得以轄免被捕受審恥辱之熱望化為烏有。前此麥帥表示不論其為日皇抑或平民，苟期避免以戰犯受審勢所不能。日內橫濱即將舉行大審，日本守舊派人士咸惶惶不安。本日美陸軍星條報報導稱：業已羈押五百名左右日戰犯，及其他與發動戰爭有關罪犯之巢鴨監獄，其絞刑台上業己新置一巨索矣。</p>

<p>香港日戰罪犯　古賀中佐落網</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統年俸問題</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕杜魯門總統年俸僅七萬五千美元，而支出浩大，若不竭力　節，將來卸任之日，必致債台高築。白宮秘書但尼　，最近曾在柯利歐雜誌發表一文，列舉杜魯門總統必不可省之日常開銷。其最低支出如下：一·聯邦捐稅四萬六千元，二·白宮私人支出二萬五千元，三·米蘇　州　稅一千元，合計七萬二千元。除去上述開支外，尚餘三千元，須以之應付其他一切開銷，有一星期內即可將所得全部俸給耗費盡凈者。如總統眷屬及私人賓客之飲食費，私人茶會費，家屬清潔洗衣費，添製衣服及捐助民主黨經費等。此外杜魯門總統購買戰時公債之踴躍，足為全國表　，而各種納費機關之邀講加人，與慈善機關之呼籲援助，亦令其應接不暇。假使有求必應，則總統一歲之俸給，在任何一個星期內，皆可支出殆盡。美國歷任總統中，祇有塔孚脫一人，對於年俸七萬五千美元表示不滿意。據其告威爾遜總統之言，謂四年任滿，竟積得俸金十萬美元，可謂難能矣。然在仁魯門總統，即使今日白宮開支，仍與塔孚脫時相同，離任之日，若僅負債十萬美元，已可謂十分幸運，緣杜魯門總統在四年任職期內，須付聯邦捐稅及本州捐稅二十萬元，而在塔孚脫時代，則並無此種担負，故能有餘俸，亦不盡由於節約也。羅斯福·胡佛及哈定三總統，皆有私人財產，柯立芝則異常儉約，威爾遜之續絃，富有資財，惟獨杜魯門總統，並無私畜。担任美國總統職務，為世界上最艱巨之工作，然就收入而言，則名　雖佳，實際上其俸給所入，幾全部於捐稅項下及因寄寓白宮，而盡還之於人民。</p>

<h3>血的日子·血的案子　南京大屠殺鐵証</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵慎之</p>
<p>世界詩聖但丁（Dante）還有千古絕唱，呌做「地獄」。吾佛釋迦牟尼，也告訴眾生說：人世有地獄。——但是，敢問：地獄在什麽地方呢？</p>
<p>我要回答你：這兒就是。</p>
<p>我最近到了南京，目覩到掩埋着成干成萬屍首的墳塚，會晤到八年前曾經身歷其境的刦後餘生，舊事重提，神經為之痙攣，說話總帶顫音，不但如此，連此刻寫這通訊稿的時侯，我的筆還在隨着手一同發抖哩。</p>
<p>敵人只知道殺人</p>
<p>本月十三日，正是南京淪陷八週年紀念日，我一到多年久違了的南京，無限的蒼凉襲上身來，當即先去訪問南京戰罪調查委員會，得悉他們的調查工作，目下正在積極進行中，其經過情形似乎還順利，但人手却很少。截止目前為止，已收集報告文件三百幾十起。當我披閱這些文件的時候，眼前就浮現出一個地獄一樣的圖畫。</p>
<p>崇善堂職員李鳴五，五十九歲，八年來生活艱苦，瘦弱衰老，他的兒子現在成都服務。他在當時曾經與一批老年人，在中國的論佛道的混合性宗教信仰仰支持之下，冒着敵人的侮辱和威脅，奮勇去做埋屍工作。他對我說：</p>
<p>「敵人只管殺人，從來沒有埋過一具死屍。」</p>
<p>他開列目擊的暴行，提供調查會的有數十件之多。</p>
<p>女性都慘遭污辱</p>
<p>他們那些提向調查會的具結書上寫着：</p>
<p>南門裏橋，有二十歲上下婦女三人，小衣上部完整，兩手握褲帶處，小衣下部破碎，如絲亂披，剜去眼目，割去耳鼻，此係拒姦受酷刑而死者。姓氏無考。</p>
<p>婦女肢體分離，兩眼怒視而死，在城內新街口三坊巷花市等處有九人之多。</p>
<p>興中門內東首城根草房內，有一位六七十歲老太婆，下身腫破，　係輪姦致死者</p>
<p>估衣廊後街路旁臥一女孩，約十二三歲，小衣撕破，閉目張嘴而死。</p>
<p>半山　路旁，有四十歲及六七十歲光景之婦女計七人，　乳刺胸，頭髪亂披，小衣破壞，昂頭怒目張口露齒而死。</p>
<p>有一女孩，約十三四歲，倒死於羊皮巷路北，破腹拽腸，兩目圓睜，口邊出血。</p>
<p>黃泥岡下，東倒西歪男屍八十多具，女屍六具，孩屍二具，均係用刀戳死。</p>
<p>我隨便抽閱幾張具結書，當時南京街頭慘景，就立刻清　地顯露了出來。</p>
<h3>物證人證紛然雜陳　狡敵罪行無法掩蔽</h3>
<p>這裏必須提出一點，即是這中間盡是婦女和兒童。日本法西斯在她們身上創造戰果，作為「大東亞新秩序」的奠基禮。但這不過是小規模的屠殺。大規模屠殺是在宣佈佔領南京之後進行的，這更是有計劃屠殺的鐵的證據。</p>
<p>根據日本支那派遣軍報導部編纂的「南京之戰跡與名勝」小冊中「南京攻略戰回顧」一章所發表：「敵」之遺棄屍體數字為五萬三千八百七十四具。日本報導部以善於說謊著稱，這次也不例外，但並不是誇大「戰果」，而相反的是把誇大性倒退了。因為死在他們刺刀，槍彈，奸淫之下的「敵」，包括婦女，兒童，青年以及戰俘在內，數字簡直令人不可置信，但這發表數字却不及兩成。</p>
<p>那小冊子中還無恥地寫道：「皇軍獲得曠古之大戰果」。是的，這就是法西斯的後果！</p>
<p>南京紅卐字會的報告，他們在十二月二十二日間收埋屍體，第一天在清凉後山埋葬屍體一二九具，中華門外望江磯埋葬一〇九具。十二月二十八日一次收殮六千四百六十八具，埋在中華門外普德寺。後來逐漸增加到九千七百廿一具。他們的工作陸續做到第二年夏夭，還沒有完結。到了十月底才把數字作一總結，共　男女屍體四萬三千零七十一具。另外崇善堂有一個報告，他們組織了四個掩埋隊，工作了四個月。共埋屍體十一萬二千二百六十七具。僅僅這兩個數字相加起來，埋屍就有十五萬五千三百三十八具，起初看到這筆數字，簡直驚駭失色，並且懷疑起來；世界上竟有這樣的事嗎？而且就發生在南京。但這實在是事實，鐵一般的事實。還有被焚化的屍體，以及其他私人掩埋的屍體，未算在內。但無論如何，這個數字和日本軍方報導相差已經如此之遠，也是鐵的事實。這些「敵」屍何以會超過所發表的戰果」？顯然這裏包含着的陰謀，殘酷，　辣，血腥的故事，日本罪犯們是企圖加以掩蓋的。</p>
<p>現在還可以舉出人證，指控在罪犯松井石根直接指導下所進行的罪行。我們南京市民應該有權科來審判松井石根，並且宣佈他的末日。</p>
<h3>法西斯敵軍拿手傑作　大規模集體屍殺</h3>
<p>下關是一個慘痛的名詞。前天我遇到那時警察廳督察魯甦，他曾經參加巷戰，十二日在三牌樓被炸受傷之後，忍痛走到挹江門，爬山城內。</p>
<p>他記下了關於當時的遭遇，他寫道：</p>
<p>「……抵上文門後，沿途房屋悉己被焚，歲寒冬月，朔風凜冽，乃復潛身人麥稭堆中，饑喝江水，掙扎至十六日清晨，見一鄉人持夏布帳在江中洗濯，招呼至前，詢以外面情況，據云離此里許之老虎山大茅洞住有難民甚多，乃酬七元，負余至洞口，時有長警六名，貯粥一桶，預備早餐，……敵寇正抵此搜索，將穴居者驅至道旁，將年輕人一一拖出，曰：「中國兵」，瞬即槍殺二十餘人，長警六各亦難免。余蹲坐地上，吆喝數次，置之不理，進粥不停，幸集合令下，棄余而去。當晚仍置於洞內，難友如手足，將年青者置入洞底白髪稚童則留洞口，寇黃錯又至搜查，拖去六人，用刺刀戮死於江岸。是晚草鞋峽一帶機槍聲甚密，約有二三十挺，連續三小時之久，疑係國單反攻激戰，次日天尚未明，來二血人，一系教導總隊馮班長，一為保安隊警郭某，述其經過，始悉敵寇入城後，將俘虜及男女老幼難民計五萬七千四百十　人，圈禁於幕府山下數小村內，斷絕飲食，凍餒而死者甚多。十六日晚，用鐵絲或繩索綁腿兩人一紮，排成四路，驅至下關草鞋峽，用機槍悉予掃射，此時被害者鼓勇前呼「奪槍奪搶」，以致屍積如山，敵復用刺刀亂戰，最後灌以煤油，縱火焚燒，馮郭二人佯臥地上，拖屍蓋身，馮則仍被戳傷右膀，兩人衣服均被燒雋。……全世界正直的人們：這是怎樣一種景象！</p>
<p>集體大署殺並不止以上一起，這種有計劃性的屠殺遍及南京市區內外，也就是說，日寇在中國土地上的屠殺是有空前規模的。我已經在上面指出敵寇故意掩飾罪行的證據，而這些大規模的數字不過是旁證着這一點。</p>
<p>當時住在鼓樓五條巷四號的被害人徐靜森，報告了另外一宗大規模屠殺他寫道。</p>
<p>「二十六年十二月十六日上午，敵兵四名，汹汹入門，搜捕青年，同居十數青年一一擄去，當時目睹成羣青年置於大方巷廣場，陸續而來，至黃昏時有數萬人（金陵大學華郡小姐有正確統計）敵　衣履不週者四五百人，以機槍慘殺於附近池塘，其餘悉數驅之而去，有落後者，亦被槍殺。」</p>
<p>這是具有規模性的集體以殺的另一個例子。另一頁報告上寫道：</p>
<p>「余親見敵人之罪行如下：有青年夏泰生，於民國二十六年古歷十一月十四日下午，有敵兵數名，至難民區西路口余之住宅，强行拖去。夏泰生隨同成羣青年，後有敵兵押送至下關江邊，用機槍射殺。</p>
<p>這是屠殺青年的一個例子。</p>
<h3>城內外遍地屍塚</h3>
<p>我寫到這裏，覺得慚愧，痛苦，憤恨，我這記載歷史的新聞記者，在二十世紀的文明時代，竟曾記下這樣的人類的行為嗎？有誰要知道什麽是法西斯的嗎？要明白他一切政治的，經濟的，文化的，軍事的所謂理論嗎？那麼這就是的，法西斯就是戰爭，就是野獸，就是屠殺！法西斯現在已經宣告末日，但人類的慘痛經騐，實在必須使全世界每一個正直的人的頭腦所永遠記憶，並且深深思考一下。</p>
<p>所埋的屍體中，屬於郊區的佔百分之六十二，我開始不明白原因何在身歷其境的市民帮我解決了這個問題。</p>
<p>當敵軍集結兵力攻城的時候，這些屠殺規模還沒有龐大展開。都沒有機會逃出的郊區的民眾，後來竟不能進入城內的難民區，（是華郡小姐和貝德士　人組織的國際委員會向敵軍交涉後劃定的）他們在白天集在一處，守望相助，但被發覺之後，多數遇難，他們目擊這些死屍，多在背部中彈，伏地而死，也有被刀戳殺，側臥在血泊中的。尤其日寇常在夜間搜索，民眾——特別是婦女們，分別成羣逃開村莊，一聽到槍聲，就藏在草堆中間，天色明亮詩，日寇登高一望，立刻發現，用機花射殺。敵寇漫山迫逐，婦女如不停步，槍聲愈密，死傷愈多。</p>
<h3>六十六歲老翁　痛述凄慘經歷</h3>
<p>現在我們再來聽一聽，崇善堂堂長　一漁的話。他今年六十六歲，腿部癱　，步履維艱。他就是掩埋十一萬屍體的主持人吧。他同我談話兩次，我不相信這抱着病痛的老人，竟做了這樣多的事，我想這樣的人，就應該獲得政府的獎章。最近他歸結起來說：</p>
<p>「城區屍體，受刀傷比中彈的多，郊區則差不多凡有女屍的地方，男屍都在較遠的地方。城區的屍體多在地下室，道路轉角處發現，鄉區的屍體，則是數百數十的躺在清渠，池塘，田埂下以及草堆中間。那情景之慘，是沒法說的，尤其是婦女們，有些是拒姦而死的，而且青黑，齒落腮破，口裏流血，挖去乳房，刺穿胸膜和腹部，腸子拖在外面，小腹踢傷，下身被刺刀亂戳過。至撕破，下　腫爛，小腹像一樣隆起。以上兩種，自二十歲左右的少婦至六七十歲的老太婆都有。還有女孩被鷄姦的……」</p>
<p>周老先生不願再說了，他搖着頭，靜默片刻，繼續說：「真是浩刦啊！「這些野獸。」</p>
<p>這就是日寇殘害婦女的真實圖畫。</p>
<p>南京城內外空地，幾乎到處埋遍屍體，現在南京燈紅酒綠，犬馬聲色，豪華逾昔，我連日憑吊各處墳塚，對這些遭受日寇慘酷殺害的人們，實不勝愴煞淚下。因為當時草草埋葬，多半毫無標幟可暴。現在我把調查所得的埋屍處所列舉在下面：</p>
<p>五台山，紅土橋至北極閣，觀音庵後竺橋東首，鼓橋北，臥鐘橋浮樓，三條巷大中橋城根，公園東首，浮橋以北地區，富貴山麓，挹江門東城根，中華門東城根，興中門至小東門城根，小　府至蓮子營城根，大樹城至藍家莊城根，中華門外兵工場雨花　花神府附近各荒地菜園，水西門外上河附近荒地菜園，小山門外至馬羣附近荒地菜園，通濟門外至方山附近荒地菜園，清凉後山，金陵大學農場，清凉山墳地，韓家巷西倉山上，古林寺山上，陰陽營南秀村，北秀村，中華門外望江磯，高　柏村，普德寺，上新河黑橋，水西門外三道桿子，上新河太陽宮，水西門外南傘巷，上新河二埂，上新河江東橋，上新河棉花堤，漢西門外廣東公墓，水西門外大王廟，下關渡固里，中央體育場公墓地，上新河中央監獄，上新河觀音庵空場，鳳凰街空場，漢中門外二道桿子，上新河北河口空場，下關九家　，下關魚雷軍營旁，下關草鞋峽空地，下關魚雷軍營碼頭，下關石榴園，幕府山下，上新河五福村，下關姜家園，下關東砲台，上元內外空地，三汶河西南空地，和平門外永清寺旁，下關煤炭港江邊，下關海軍醫院後堤邊，上新河甘露寺空場，中華門外華　寺山頂，太平門外城根，中華門外安德里西山上，上新河賈家桑園空地，下關兵站處江邊，老江口埂邊，下關江灘邊。</p>
<h3>高逆冠吾立碑　死者幽魂難安</h3>
<p>漢奸高冠吾（偽組織維新政府的市政督辦）也曾在馬鞍山靈谷寺一帶收集過三千多具骸骨，在靈谷寺東深　厚封，造了一個相當漂亮的「無主孤魂墓」，刻題碑石。他來收集的時候，已經是廿七年十二月，被書者的屍首僅餘白骨，南京市大規模的掩埋工作已經由民眾動手做完了。高冠吾在碑上無恥地寫道：</p>
<p>「諸君遭時喪亂，膏血肉於荒原，寄骸骨於丘隴，為軍為民，為男為婦，為老為稺，有後無後，舉莫能知。人生憯痛，莫大於生無所養，死無所喪，况暴骨無依如諸君者，雖然死生有命，修短有數，詢如違人之論，彭殤可齊，隨化俱盡，蓋人之所爭者，不在久暫之歲月，而在不朽之德業與精神也。……」</p>
<p>呸！這簡直是極大的侮蔑，而且包含着和平陰謀宣傳，他强調「暴骨無依」，接着無異是說他們被日寇屠殺得好。這塊碑現在還　立在那裹，一日不毀，漢奸們一日不殺，這些死難者的靈魂是一日不能安息的。</p>
<p>日寇投降之後，在南京的中國戰俘解放了。他們中間有在南京被俘的，現在只有三十六人。但幾乎包括當時參加南京巷戰的所有單位。他們告訴我一件最殘忍的故事：日寇曾在紫金山活焚兩千人，包括戰俘和民眾。這天是十二月十二日，南京淪陷前一天</p>
<p>要查明被日寇殺害的確數，是一件不容易的事，但根據我的實地調查，估計大致的數字，至少有二十五萬人在陸續被殺害，十萬人在江中直接或間接　殺害，日寇報導部　　着：「海軍部隊，　　　　　　後打開長江，十三日晚到達下關，陸海軍精銳完全　　」。</p>
<p>下關的屠殺正是日寇陸海軍的「傑作」。為了　　明瞭舉行，要嚴　審判他的，為了湔雪人類大恥辱，也要嚴厲審判他們（南京淪陷八週年紀念日寄自南京）</p>

<h3>慘哉此景！</h3>
<p>頑惡的日本軍人，在一九三七年尾，帶足了彈藥，殘殺了數十萬手無寸鐵的南京市民。這一幕血案，實在可以作為日本侵華暴行之一個典型。（上）圖示：中國人民被慘殺後，肚腸拖出之慘狀，連婦女與孩子也逃不出苦難的命運。（下）圖示：日軍創造了暗無天日之恐怖世界，却以「偉大戰果」來「誇耀」。（新聞天地社贈刋）</p>

<h3>論昆明學潮</h3>
<p>— 章士釗</p>
<p>昆明學潮，起於十一月二十五夜間四大學之演說會。演題為反對內戰，到者師生六千餘眾。所演未修，燈火告斷，牆外槍聲斗起，子彈飛如雨雹。會以是夭關，而學生大憤。謂是政府干涉集會言論自由，張皇號召，勢益恢　。第二軍官總隊學員，與各大校學生衝突時聞。十二月一日，致有手榴彈死傷人事。尋債知犯者為陳奇達·劉友沼，而掩捕之，皆退伍軍人也。供詞消悅，疑者愈夥。一方謂反動分子挑撥離間之計，一方　特殊勢力發蹤指示之為。蔣主席電諭學生復課，初亦未見大效。全省警備司令關麟徵引咎辭職，或竟形同其文。卒之投彈主犯伏法，憤議稍平。　！誰為為之，孰令致之？五四運動以來，此類現象，誠屬司空見慣，而在今日憲政開始時期，其應作何解釋，具何種因果，見仁見智，各有未同。鄙陋所知，請得申論。</p>
<p>近頃政府號稱實施憲政，凡機　之備豫，文告之敦促，幾於應有儘有。究其實訓政告終，憲政伊始，其銜接處，已達於水到渠成之候否乎？政府之真意何在乎！人民所探測於政府者為何等乎？此途人可得而見告曰；憲政者名而已矣，政府之真意，決不在是。環政府而立之官若吏，自相告語若曰：憲政者名而已矣，元首之真意，決不在是。甚至主特風會之論師策士，　微中亦切切私語曰：憲政云者，吾儕假是名以齣齕人而已，國民之真實程度，何足企是？彼以名來，此以名應，氣成乖盤，事等刧持。以本案言之：自警備司令以逮軍官總隊學員，豈不知言論自由為憲政之基礎，國家並無明文，征討不庭，反對內戰，有何罪戾？惟其冥冥中有主宰　者，以謂壓抑言論，限制自由，阨反內戰派，使不得為中共張目，本中樞之的　，即吾屬之職司，政府縱格於輿論之　響，迫於與國之督　，勢不能不以此舉為非，乃明　之而暗發之，功名利祿之途，行由是出，將何憚而不為？其在他一面，三五狡點者流，今日利用青年弱點，假藉名義，肆其　鼓，一旦得志，體制攸關，昔所　　，　成禁忌，益且不　　　　　，變本加厲，　　　一　之權若位者，又屬事勢之所必然。語云：其父殺人，其子必且行刧。揆類察迹，可以知來。</p>
<p>曹　下令求賢，指索　　受金才堪用世之人，職官為設　金校尉，發　中郎將等號。此作帝與作戰併為一事，帝王中殆無第二人為之。然其効比之貌在求賢而情在求盜者，　為直截了當。禮云：堯舜　天下以仁，而民從之，桀紂率天下以暴，而民從之，其所令反其所好，而民不從。漢第五倫曰：以身教者從，以言教者訟。宋蘇軾亦言：民不從上之令而從其意。倘身言之間，隱非和合，或令意之際，顯有差池，從執洞洞　　之言與令以臨於人，而處處相反之跡與象，己若泥中關獸，掩不勝掩，將何以服人心而壹內志？僕病未知。</p>
<p>右誼既明，足見本案癥結所在。誰則敢曰：昆明學潮，必陽梗政府之令，險奉政府之意之所為？而天下人言嘖嘖，眾目睽睽，委將政府之意與令，打成兩　，　擅蘇張之舌，無從置辯。吾顯不解何以致此？孟子曰：大下烏乎定，定於一。竊謂自來豪傑之士，能以定一天下，如今蔣主席者，古今蓋難其選。先既以定率國人苦戰八載，拔其國於存亡絕續之交。旋復以定為國人開基萬年，進其國終自由平等之域。非前之定，無以啟後之定；凡後之定，舉以繼前之定。言如　綍，功在山河，將何所利而不以誠示天不後世為？以知蘇子膽之言，　之今日而路　者，　　　奉行最高命令　濟之　　，　　有所　　，不自檢制其行為，馴致疑謗生於無形，　惑偏於有眾而已，非有他也。</p>
<p>然則如之何而可？曰：凡家國事，　不出一個識字。誠則明，明則誠。本案之如何辦理，不過末節。情實稍有出大，亦無大礙。惟望　成有以助當局之明，而益其後日之誠。因使元首之大明大誠，　　世界，光輝不滅足矣。至國人不解善用　自由，夫人而知之。無限自由，密接於十年訓政束縛馳　之後，亦嫌凌　而無　臻於　活。此中宜如何質劑，始於憲政無　，此別「問題，當更僕言之。</p>

<h3>新匯率傳下週可公布　烚赤美鈔均見堅定</h3>
<p>丙債一度哄出六百大關</p>
<p>烚赤昨以新匯率業經最高經濟會議決定，下週內即將公佈，人心以產等匯率（詳情與第四期經濟週報所提供者相彷彿）對美金現鈔見仁見智，取捨不同，微現志忑，上塲即承前收餘勢散空猖獗，盤跌至七〇萬三，銀行方面見低陸續收購，七〇萬大關得以保持，逐漸盤穩，迨午刻即有空方抵補，曾數度拉高至七三萬以上，最後呆滯，無何變化，結果較前收微昇五千，銀樓飾金掛七萬八，紋銀六百元，銀元仍爲四百四至四百五間，暗拆因投機帮觀望，銷路更　，跌至六分及八分。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔以陪都金鈔收市價之差率達六八五元對十兩，並聞該地對新匯寧一般看法，最高不過一三五〇元，引動賣戶，上塲即破一二〇〇元關，套賣又　，最低達一一六五元，此時套價已　至六〇〇元以上，台金市回好，大戶遂紛紛補進，逐步回漲至一二二〇元以上，結果較前收無基榮辱，港幣求供平衡，廣帮對於老貨漸加注意，較前日微昇，新貨則平。</p>
<p>證券　公債初時甚爲平靜，內種會破人五百元關內，業中大戶脫金維持，漸見起化，迨午刻四川路某銀行突然大量脫金購債，猛購丙種五百餘萬，狹窄之價市頓現奇觀，哄到六百元大關外　惟冷門雜脾以時問不及，未能跟上，差價又大爲拔開，結果較前好起十五元至八十元不等，趨勢在操縱之下，努將再高。</p>

<h3>李登輝先生訪問記</h3>
<p>抗戰勝利以　，一片復員聲中，西遷各大學院校，紛紛計議復校。國立復旦大學，據已有在滬成立復校委員會之訊，記者特專訪復大老校長李登　氏於霞飛路蕊邨私邸，承詳吿種切如下：</p>
<p>上海復大補習部在敵僞侵佔時期，抱定三原則應付，即（一）不與敵僞妥協，（二）不受敵僞津貼，（三）不能維持則關門。並與重慶章校長心心相印，殊途同　，才達今日光明之路。</p>
<p>原有校舍</p>
<p>原有江灣校舍，如男女生宿舍及體育館，已全部被燬，其餘受損部分，曾由僞上海大學侵佔時加以修葺，尙可應用。復大補習部方面，業於上月初，光將土木工程系。化學系，搬回上課。校之西陲，日寇曾建有大營房一座，可容數千人，現由國軍借用，一旦撤離，即可收回自用。</p>
<p>東歸日期</p>
<p>重慶北　總校，全部東歸之期，當在明年桂枝聰香時節。章校長於前月由渝飛滬，商討復校問題，成立復校委員會，分組積極進行，並經會同敎育當局察勘無錫新校址。</p>
<p>無錫新址</p>
<p>其計劃進行遠在戰前。無錫校址，頻太湖，計面積達一千〇一十四畝，較之北碚江灣二處相合尙大一倍，距城僅需四十分鐘軍程，共地鬧中取靜，距都市不遠，而太湖三萬六千頃，湖光山色，又得飽暨無餘，陶養性情，開拓胸襟，此爲最佳。在此環境中，罕有不能造就人才者，所謂地靈則人傑惟今尙是空地，完成猶待時日。</p>
<p>渝滬合併　現在上海復大補習部，分爲四院，共有學生一千四百餘人。重慶總校，分爲五院，共有學生二千五百餘人，明年全部搬回之後，與滬部合併爲一，便將一年級生先往無錫上課，在校舍未完成前，擬將就近廟宇祠堂，暫行借用。</p>
<p>校慶改期　復大成立迄今已有四十年之歷史，今年預備舉行四十週慶祝紀念，因滬渝遙隔，改在明年同時舉行，届時予（李氏自稱）將退休，校務統歸章校長担任云云。</p>

<h3>中美籃球義賽　昨晚揭幕盛況空前　華聯中靑雙勝利　今晚華聯戰奧西納</h3>
<p>本報與同德　學院聯合主辦壽募助學金中美籃球義賽，昨晚在舊回力球塲揭幕，華聯中靑兩隊先後獲勝，亞爾培路畔，盛况空前，熱心助學之球迷，爭先恐後，今晚七時半將續有精彩比賽兩塲。茲記昨賽戰情如次：</p>
<p>潘氏開球　比賽七時半開始，華聯藥對美陸特先行交綏，由潘公展氏親臨行開球禮，潘氏將球一擲後，大戰開始，華聯先用最理想五人上塲，美特務球藝稍差，華聯節節佔先，竟以廿三對六佔絕對優勝，美陸特一籌莫展，華聯乃全部調生力軍上塲，上半時華聯仍以二七對一六佔先。下半時美陸特曾一度追至卅三對二七，但華聯究非弱者，終結果四六對三四，華聯輕取美陸特。</p>
<p>一球獲勝　次幕原定中靑迎戰美海蜂，後者適以事不到，改由美海特應戰，由郝更生氏執行開球。美海特賴身材高大，中靑努力謹愼，僅追隨於後，二〇比十七時，中靑忽見轉機，陳淸江二罰一擲，反以二十一對二〇初度趨前，上半時中靑終得以廿三對廿二小勝一分。下半時中靑愈戰愈勇，分數此起彼落，觀衆吶喊助威之聲，不絕於耳。在三六平等時，中靑異常謹愼，張錦璇最後一射，以三八對三六勝一球。</p>
<p>今晚大戰　今日下午七時半起照舊二塲，在原處舉行，門票普通券四百元，榮譽券則改爲一千元三千元兩種，並請王曉　氏開球，今日秩序，改定如下：</p>
<p>美海蜂—中靑會　七時半</p>
<p>奧西納—華聯藥　八時半</p>
<p>海蜂實力未知，奧西納與華聯之戰，將僞最精彩之一幕，蓋奧西納爲美軍聯賽中之錦標隊，實力雄厚，華聯不啻華人代表隊，今賽爲中美冠軍爭雄，球迷富不輕易放鬆機會，預料今日將有空前盛况。</p>
<h3>如何整理本市的私校</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>上海是中國敎育比較發達的地方。發達的原因除了有少數的市立學校之外還有大部分的私立學校。它們的好壞足以影響本市整個敎育的局勢。現在市教育局正在派員視察各校。我們藉這個機會來說幾句話。</p>
<p>我們認爲上海的學校（以中小學而論）雖然在數量上不算少，但是內容方面充實的少，貧乏的多。爲地方敎育而辦學校固然不少，而以學校爲商店也有。因為政府當局還不能辦到普及敎育的地步，私人辦學是要鼓勵。但是有許多超出情理之外的壞學校，我們希望敎育當局要無情的予以取締。</p>
<p>一個好的學校少不了三個條件。第一，公平而有工作效能的行政人員，第二，良好的敎師；第三，充足的經費。現在我們在上海的私立學校中發現兩種學校：</p>
<p>一種是有公正而有效能行政人員和優良的敎師的學校，可是他們有辦學的能力和熱忱，而遭受經濟上的壓迫，使他們的學校沒有適當的發展。對於這種學校我們希望敎育當局予以經濟上的援助。在敎育行政預算上除了市立學校的經費之外再添一項私校補助費。</p>
<p>還有一種學校，經費方面雖不發生多大問題，但沒有好的校長和敎員。因爲校長的經濟不公開，壓低敎員的待遇，縮少學生上課的鐘點，使好的敎員站不住脚。我聽說南市有一個學校裏敎員的待遇每月祗有僞幣四萬元左右。還有一個小學六級學生祗用兩個敎員，用「三級複式」制，待遇僅偽幣三十萬元。這樣的學校我們希望敎育當局立即勒令停辦！</p>

<h3>滬市地方協會　歡迎葉鈕兩宣慰使</h3>
<p>上海市地方協會，於昨日下午四時在浦東大樓六樓，歡迎葉鈕二宣慰大使，到葉楚傖·鈕永建·陳行·劉鴻生·王曉籟等及工商各界地方人士一百餘人，由該會會長杜月笙主席致詞如次：</p>
<p>杜月笙氏　致歡迎詞</p>
<p>上海光復後，中央大員，先後蒞止，指導有加，市民感奮異常。主席於日理萬幾之餘，關懷江南民衆，茲又特派兩位宣慰使，遠這飛滬，傳述德意，存問撫慰，更覺感激萬狀。兩位宣慰使，年高德劭，黨國先進，且又同為蘇籍，對於上海，對於江南，具有深切之關係，輶軒所經，歸而入吿，必能仰纾　主座之憂勤，下慰吾民之喁望。月笙不敏，謹代表市民，敬致歡迎與感謝之意。上海淪陷，爲期之早，僅次於平津，敵人佔領本市，爲西進南進基點，八年之中，剝削榨取，摧殘蹂躪，無所不用其極，故上海市民，受苦最深，等候天亮，其情彌切，以往經過，兩位宣慰使，知之甚詳，無待申說．敵人投降後天日重光，市民歷長期的期待，急謀痛苦的解除，心情急迫，自在意中，而其時倉卒受降，準備不及，一般措施，未能完全適應，容亦有之，但千慮一失，賢者難免。至於中央之苦心，當局之勤政，則全市市民，固皆深切諒解。</p>
<p>安定社會　先決條件</p>
<p>依據鄙見，安定社會，有兩個先決條件，一為生活之穩定，一爲秩序之維持，這兩件事，一體兩面，互爲因果。經過八年的長期抗戰，一般國民道德，其水準自隨之低落，但同時國民生活，絕大部份，却至今還够不上水準，如果生產機構，不致停頓，人民獲有職業，運輸情形，設法改善，貨物使能暢流，各地治安，悉力恢復，西姓不再流離失所，那麼飢者易爲食，渴者易為飮，在此戰事　經結束之後，百廢待舉，老百姓的願望，只求安居樂業，如能使之滿足，便已得到安慰，所以今日之事，在於工人能够得到工作，商人能够照常營業，游兵散勇，奸黨匪徒，一體肅淸，使農民得以回到田園，從事耕種，便是使人心安定，社會秩序，恢復正常。此雖卑之無甚高論，而實事求是，總須先就安定民生着手，自無疑義。又各地情形，彼此不同，以往設施，或不合今日環境，改良更始，自屬需要。但事有緩急，時有先後。</p>
<p>與其勞民不如用民</p>
<p>與其因無謂之事而勞民，不如待必要而用民，與其取之於民，以供不急之務，不如藏之於民，以存一綫生機，近來若干地方，據報章所載，因為供應交際及不急之務，旣已竭民之力，又復　民之財，以致民怨沸騰，致有要求「水不再加深火不再加熱」之語。此其沉痛，非所忍言指導，錢市長悉心規復，較之接收初期，已大有長足的進步。再假時日，自必蒸蒸日上。本會爲各界人士綜合組織，包括金融工商敎育文化及自由職業，成立於八一三前期，平時致力於社會事業，如農村之改進，兒童之敎義，民食之調劑，各項統計之編製。戰時致力於難胞之救濟，軍隊之慰勞，各項救國捐款之勸募，其所編製之图表，與出版之刋物，因在淪陷之後，大部分均已焚燬，小部分則移送後方，尙未運回，故今日不能獻呈。戰後復興，本是件艱鉅的工作，本會立塲，一向以服務地方爲職志，今後仍當在中央政策領導之下，協助地方當局，在此艱鉅工作之中，貢獻出所有的力量，以期達成任務，還請兩位宜慰使，多多指示。</p>
<p>葉楚傖謂　取善去惡</p>
<p>繼由葉楚傖致詞，略謂：此地是杜先生所領導的地方協會，正好聽聽諸位地方賢達的話，中央是全國地方合成的中央，中央是全體人民的中央，所以對於人民的意見，中央是極重視的，諸位很多是實業界的領袖，實業之對於建國，至爲重要，願各位把各方面眞實的情形講出來，我一定報吿中央，我想蔣主席一定很重觀諸位的意見，「善在必行，惡在必去」，應與應革，必可迅速辦理。繼由鈕永建氏致詞對於中央之重視民權和民生頗多闡述。</p>
<p>海陸運輸　前途樂觀</p>
<p>旋杜氏請劉鴻生報告上海運輸及經濟情形，略謂：美國十八艘海輪與八自由輪不久全可抵埠，航運前途，頗有曙光，陸上運輸，現悉有二十具火軍頭，與三七四〇噸火車材料來滬，陸路運輸，前途亦可樂觀。言及經濟復員，當先圖恢復戰前狀態，工廠開工，工人失業問題解決，市面漸漸繁榮，民生問題，亦可迎刃而解，並望速將交易所恢復，特別重視實業股票，對於實業前途，裨益不淺。繼由中央銀行副總裁兼京滬區財政金融特派員陳行對於開展实業，表示兩點意見，一，要有一個强有力的專門投資實業的銀行，二，股東大量出资，以補國家貸款之不足，繼由蔡正雅報吿上海物價生活指數，以十一月份與戰前相此，工人總指數增一〇二一倍，職員增七八四倍，西僑增九六五倍，次章劍慧金潤庠薛明劍徐永祚，先後報吿民問疾苦的種種眞實情形。二宣慰使皆表示決將各情轉報中央。</p>
<h3>新匯率風傳聲中　貝淞蓀抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行經理貝淞蓀，昨日由渝搭機抵滬。貝氏係外滙專家，於數月前隨宋院長赴美，與美財政當局商討我國各金融問題，於月初由美返渝，向中樞當局報吿赴美情形。往訪記者昨詢貝氏，近日盛傳外滙兌率已決定，是否將於日內公佈。據貝氏吿記者，對於此項傳說，渠尙未有所聞。本市金融界人士昨聲稱，貝氏來滬後即將對外滙問題作重要檢討。</p>

<h3>陳霆銳聘美歸來　暢談實行法治</h3>
<p>— 平爾</p>
<p>「中國今日要民治，先得要法治。」</p>
<p>這是參政員陳霆銳的見解，陳氏是上海的名律師，此次應美函務院之邀，以司法院特派員的資格，赴美考察，近始返滬，記者特往詢關於美國最近司法行政情形。</p>
<p>陳氏對記者說：此次在美，跑遍各洲及各大都市，在不同的情形下，和美國的社會政治領袖及平民都有了接觸。使我有深刻印象的是：美國人對中國的友好，對中國的愛護，完全出於至誠。他們對中國的前途抱有厚望。我所遇到的美國人士都衆口一詞地希望中國在政治一能團結，在司法上能踏上法治的大道。</p>
<p>陳氏又說：目前美國游炎極多，然中國若要吸收此項游資，則國內政治情形必需平靖，使工商業可盡量發展。其次，投資者必需有法律上的保障，美國各界人士的期望是：（一）中國能有現代化的法律。（二）中國能有健全的法院。關於現代化法律，陳氏對記者說：以往我國法律是採取德日的制度，這大陸派的法律是非民主化的。英美法律則處處以人民的主權和利益爲立法的基礎，營如英美的陪審制，不但能使人民有參與立決及司法行政的機會，並使人民在參與陪審的時候，能普遍地得到法律智識，中國以後須隨潮流的演進，去建立現代化的法律。</p>
<p>陳氏到美國的時候，對德日的戰爭正進入最後階段，美政府對物價的管制及物資的分配都很嚴。偶有商人經營黑市買賣或抬高價格，一經查悉，則必受法律上的嚴厲制裁。在美考察的數月中，從未見聞到政府官員借地位權勢而經商發財的，因此我以爲美國法律最大的優點就是：法律免爲人民而設，在法律前，上至大總統，下至平民，都站在平等地位，同受法律的支配。</p>
<p>陳氏旅美考察的結論是：中國富强的基礎，在制定眞正的法治，使我國能在法治的精神下產生健全的政府，工商業及社會，陳氏希望與論界能對中國法治的前途，喚起全人民的注意。</p>

<h3>期望於今日的藝壇</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>經過了八年的抗戰，藝壇也可以說經過了一次洪爐的鍛煉，同時它在抗戰期內的貢獻是偉大的。現在隨着勝利來臨，步入建國復興的時期，它更是負了重大的使命。我們但看：敎育的普及，文化的提高，學能的訓練，工商的繁榮，國際間的溝通，甚至交通的發展，連續的開拓，那一種不是建國的重要工作，那一種不是需要藝壇工作者的襄助；因為藝壇的使命的重大，所以我們期望於今日之藝壇者亦奇厚。筆者是一個素喜與游藝界接觸而拿能想到的與各位談談。</p>
<p>藝壇的工作由『點』而擴展到『面』，已經在這次抗戰中得到收獲，現在在建設時期，我們更需由『面』，擴展開來。政府收復失地該『莫失人心』，『莫失人心』其實亦該應用於今日之藝壇，大後方的藝人回到收復區的時候，要把數年來他們奮門上進的精神繼持着，更需要把敵人所給予藝壇的破壞迅速挽救過來。用我們全部的精力來建設一個新的藝壇，大商埠同京省城固然是工作的目標地，我們更要在邊區同在僻鄕開闢我們新藝壇的工作。</p>
<p>昔日的藝壇是『主角制』，是幾個人的天下，我希望未來的藝壇能够多發掘有　天才和專才的藝人，藝人的成功是不需要『捧』的。我們要敎育行政當局注意到藝壇人才的養成及訓練的問題，唯有用這批人力才能使藝壇與建設工作相輔而行。</p>
<p>今日的世界已是民主的世界，而今日的藝壇卻尚未到『民主』的藝壇，以各戲院的票價就可證明；其定價的高昂直呌我們呼門不入；挽救的辦法一面是行政地方當局該在可能範圍內，在各地普設民眾劇場或民眾藝術館，以最低定價灌輸藝術於民眾；一面需削減藝壇的商人。在五年戰後經濟計劃結束的時候，我希望每一個中國人是中國藝壇的欣賞者，我希望每一個中國人能在舞臺上看到新中國的劇藝，我希望每一個中國人能在銀幕上看到新中國的發展。</p>
<h3>看梅蘭芳四齣戲</h3>
<p>— 陳德珍</p>
<p>王　　　　　　，斷橋，及奇雙會共四劇，獨遊園驚夢因去晚已成尾聲，實為遺憾，茲特簡誌觀感於后，或為向隅觀眾所樂聞也！</p>
<p>刺虎—此戲月前曾在蘭心演出，為梅氏傑作，惟一隻虎由程少餘配演，不免遜色，茍易王玉讓必更精彩無疑，此戲分六場，前場定計并勸飲末場乃進帳刺虎，為最緊張，更梅氏演來一絲不懈，剛烈之氣，充溢眉宇，吾國有此巾幗英雄，實無上光榮也！</p>
<p>思凡—為單人演唱之戲，更覺繁重，且身段眾多，梅氏演來美妙可觀，雖則嗓音寬亮，行腔婉轉，臉部表情更佳，不蕩不淫，而觀之自樂，此即梅氏可貴處，誦經時之心不在經，情狀甚妙，步至山門以外，偶見大自然景物之美，欣喜之色，即現眉間，而逃至山下時，因已獲得解放，還她自由，更是歡欣矣，此劇梅氏飾少尼色空，大意因不甘庵中清冷，生活枯燥，終於逃出禪關，提倡解放，宣揚自由，其意識殊佳也！</p>
<p>斷橋—此為民間故事，白蛇傳中之一節，婦孺皆曉，梅飾白娘娘，　內叫『苦哇』，凄慘不忍聞，旣而偕小青出場，打腰包，全身縞素，表示腹中陣陣作疼之狀，不禁令人一掬同情之淚，小青責許負義，怒目相向，而白術　不遺餘地，愛憐備至，并自嗟命薄，表現夫妻深情，眾皆動容，唱『金絡索』一曲，則如泣如訴，似怨似慕，聞之廻腸蕩氣，俞五飾許仙，做表極佳，跪求乞憐時更好，傳茗之小青也不弱，只是面容太可怕耳！</p>
<p>奇雙會—即販馬記，為近年走紅之吹腔戲，自哭監起至三拉團圓止，蘭芳之桂枝，端麗嫻雅，穩重大方，的是夫人身份，聽李奇哭訴時，欲認父而不敢認，心中柔腸百轉，　上喜懼不定，眞是動人，寫狀一　與振飛一唱一和一言一答，說不盡旖旎風光，萬種溫存，閨房之樂，令人艷羨，這情景之美，吧觀止矣，配角皆屬名伶，更見珠聯璧合也！</p>
<h3>舊戲中的道德</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>茲戲，包括崑曲，高腔，奏腔，弋腔，平劇，以及各地方戲而言，平劇出生較遲，只有百餘年壽命，但它能深入民間，受大量民眾的歡迎，普遍全國各地，甚至一個村鎭，亦有它的足跡，所以它表現的好壞，影響於社會民眾者甚大。</p>
<p>我因為研究通俗敎育，我的性情又與戲劇相近　，遂專門鉆研舊戲，舊戲中平劇幾近通俗，觀眾最多，所以我對它下了很多的工夫，如今單談平劇。</p>
<p>平劇可分為歷史戲，家庭戲，諷刺戲，雜戲，各類，它是集合古戲及地方戲的大成，內含有崑曲，梆子，徽調，漢調，各種腔調，尤其沿襲崑曲成分更多，大部分戲本，多溺自崑曲，歷史劇大半全是。</p>
<p>平劇旣是崑曲的　苗裔，它表現的意義，亦和崑曲一樣，積極注重雜護道德，對於亡國君主的昏庸荒淫，臣宰的忠正奸邪，特別加倍寫出，給人殷鑑，呌人警惕。</p>
<p>這屬於歷史戲，家庭戲中，表現仁，孝，信，義，的戲亦很多，例子觸目皆是，不必一一舉出，另外有諷刺戲，像『連升三級』，描繪一個客店主人的勢利眼，入木三分，　有雜戲及神怪戲，是留作調劑眼光及時間之用，無關宏旨，總之，舊戲的目的，純為維持忠孝仁愛，禮義廉恥，種種道德而設，斷非專供娛樂之物，平劇類此，其他舊戲，亦復如此。</p>
<p>民國成立以來，三十餘年，中間經過軍閥專政，外寇侵略，社會不寗，民生未安，舊道德遂一落千丈，加以八年抗戰，無暇講求，尤其淪陷區人民，寡廉喪恥，舊道德破壞無餘，又値邪說橫行，此時危險殊甚，正應提倡舊道德以圖挽救，吾謂欲保存道德，先從改良舊戲入手，方能收潛移默化之功，奏事半功倍之效，想政府首長，社會賢　，眼光若矩。早見及此矣。</p>
<h3>戰後好萊塢動態</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>自歐亞相繼發生戰爭後，好萊塢影片的海外市場，一落千丈，電影事業受到空前的打擊。所產影片，祇能在南北美洲放映，市場不知縮小了多少。等到美國參戰後，情形又為之一變，大公司由國家指導或統制，攝宣傳性質的戰爭片，小公司支撐不住，相率關門。男女明星，有一部分被徵入伍或志願服務，整個影城，顯現出衰歇的氣象來。</p>
<p>現在美國是勝利了，世界和平實現，影城自然又重新活動起來。除了　　　公司，正在計劃拍攝大量影片，停業小公司亦正急於復員復業。曾赴職地或後方的男女明星，一部分已返回好萊塢，預備重試水銀燈生活。一切的一切，是和戰爭期內不同了。雖然五六年來，影人中有少數已死亡東老去，但聞名世界的明星，大部健全，不久可和我們再見。</p>
<p>經過這樣一個大的轉變，好萊塢影片公司的作風，當然要改變了。因為最近美國的報章雜誌上面，凡是關於征人的日記，間諜的活動，以及國際陰謀，戰地報告等文字，大受讀者的歡迎。所以好萊塢的影片公司，今後的電影腳本，也將採取此種材料。現正向各方徵求。同時，因為美國人八年來始終同情於中國，對中國的抗戰，尤其贊偑，所以關於中國的　戰爭故事，及戰地實況一類題材，也擬從事蒐集，編成劇本，攝成影片。我們可預料到這類影片，至少在今後一二年中，將盛極一時的。</p>
<h3>一周影劇</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>打開報紙的戲目廣告，眞是五花八門，好像點綴得「花枝招展」的美人，也顯得是「歌舞昇平」的世界，然而當你用欣賞藝術的眼光，從另一個角度上去觀察，那就會使你失望，甚至悲哀，因為值得看與够得上選擇條件的戲，實在是少得太可憐了。</p>
<p>在本週中可以一提的是。</p>
<p>日本間諜（影片）</p>
<p>這一部影片是陪都中國製片廠的出品，是大後方運滬繼「氣壯山河」後即將上演於「大光明」·「南京」的一張新片。場面偉大，幾為國際影片之冠。導演霄　美，在上海人是不曾生疏的，主演日本一女間諜的是肅靜子小姐。這是大後方的新人，在上海是很少人知道的，這裏我們將看到虞小姐的演技。尤其是英美僑民參加演出，到是上海人看過了偽片「饜江遺恨」以後，可以換換口味的。</p>
<p>妙峰山（話劇）</p>
<p>這是丁西林在四年前作品。『妙峰山』是以一個從農民出身的游擊英雄王老虎為主人公，在抗戰中的　　革命戰爭作　　，寫下了真正在抗戰中功偉績的史實。它將告　我們怎樣的軍隊才能得到人民的擁護，怎樣才能支持到勝利，才能收得民心。尤其是作者處理這樣嚴肅的題材，而用俏皮，潑辣的手法，到今天為止，我們還沒有看到過超出他的喜劇的筆觸。這是抗戰的真實的描繪，在身為老百姓的我們看來，無疑是會感到分外的親切的。</p>
<p>少年遊（話劇）</p>
<p>『少年遊』有情，『少年遊』是詩。『少年遊』是吳祖光在大後方完成的作品。但『少年遊』不是矛盾筆下的『腐蝕』中的一批青年。有人說，這是吳祖光自己的少年時代，也許，是可能的，因為作品的真實性是允許的。總之『少年遊』是值得一提的一齣戲。</p>
<p>孟姜女（音樂劇）</p>
<p>這是一齣以音樂為主而舞蹈，對白等并重的戲，這在中國是新的嘗試，一般觀眾有不能領略它的意境或欣賞這一中國古典藝術的美的感覺，但這一甞試，現確已受到各方面的注目和引起了對今後中國戲劇路向問題的檢討。今晚上海廣播電臺播送該劇至全國，就可見各方面重視『孟姜女』的一般了。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳的戲（崑曲）</p>
<p>對梅蘭芳博士的評價，是早有定論的，不用在下再業嚕　，問題是在梅蘭芳的忠貞不阿，今日重上舞漢，是值得紀念的。尤其是他的藝術水準，是够得上稱一　代表中國藝術的。而且，梅博士的出演機會，今後恐怕不會多，的確是值得一看的。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>一面觀球一面助學　預測今晚更趨熱烈　襄贊義舉是應盡天職</h3>
<p>中美籃球義賽，昨晚開幕，比賽兩場，情況熱烈，得未曾有。記者躬與其盛，有不能已於言者，摭述一二，以告向隅諸君：</p>
<p>公眾秩序井然　中華運動場畔，不到七時，各界觀眾蝟集，車馬盈門，擠得水洩不通，有的人很擔心秩序恐有紊亂，於知該場負責人員，成竹在胸，導觀眾依次入座，招待及糾察多人，也從旁協助，不一會兒，大家各就各位，秩序井然，足見觀眾程度，已臻達水準，誠是可喜的現象。</p>
<p>球員謹守道德　任何事業，必須謹守道德，運動亦何曾不然，球賽是一種劇烈運動，在你爭我奪，難解難分的時候，最易發生不規則的舉動，而況中美兩國的國際比賽，血統習俗，互有差別，昨晚雙方競爭自競爭，奔逐自奔逐；而始終保持道德觀念，與球賽紀律，在國際友誼上，可算和衷共濟，確是難能可貴。</p>
<p>觀眾情緒熱烈　照昨晚開幕賽觀眾熱烈的情緒來推測，今晚定必格外有勁，因本日適逢星期，海上市民趁休　之餘，晚上觀兩場球賽，提神醒腦，自必更有興味。而況　券助學救濟清寒，為國儲材，原是人們應有的天職，所謂一舉兩得，何樂不為？</p>
<h3>川邨紀念塔　應立即改名　請市政當局注意</h3>
<p>上月二十八日本欄編者指示我們的，現社會頗有不合理的事，需工民眾去督促，使負責當局有所警惕。現在民主時代，任何政事，應該以民為主，誰也無法阻撓。因此我竭誠擁護貴欄的立場，敢在這裏提出一些小感想。每當廿六路　　電車　　　　　路小沙渡路時，很　　的是敵寇摧殘我們的「川邨紀念塔」，依舊在我們面前聳立着。經八年血戰的磨煉，我國國際地位抬高，治外法權取消，各地租界收回，難道這「川邨紀念塔」侵略我國的劣績，還有特殊性的存在嗎？</p>
<p>筆者要求立刻消滅「川邨紀念塔」的惡劣名稱，而改為中山紀念塔·中正紀念塔·孤軍紀念塔或無名英雄紀念塔…等，以及民眾真正擁護的偉大人物，或偉大史績的事實命名，來增進并啟發市民的民族思想。我提出這個問題，請市政當局備考。</p>

<h3>Reception at Huai Ren Tang for Chinese and Foreign Guests: Chairman and Madame Chiang Host Tea Party, Offering Comfort and Encouragement to Local Gentry and Elders</h3>
<p>"[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, held a grand tea party at Huai Ren Tang at 4 PM on the 15th to receive Chinese and foreign guests. Among those attending were local gentry and elders from Peiping and Tianjin: Zan Yunpeng, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhu Qiqian, Gu Zhongxiu, Pan Qibi, Wang Shuchang, Yu Zhen, educators Chen Yuan, Li Yuzhu, Lu Zhizhang, Wang Tongling, Zuo Zonglun, Yu Qichang, Shi Zhiquan, Miao Qun; representatives of the Tibetan clergy Danba Dazha and Ge Bi Dada Haerba and their spouses; religious representatives Chang Zichun and Scott; women's representatives Zhou Liang Lingxian; journalists Cheng Shewo and Cao Gusha from newspapers and magazines such as the Associated Press, United Press, Reuters, Time, Life Magazine, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun; councilors Mo Dehui and Rao Fenghuang; industry and commerce representatives Yan and student representatives Yang Shaoye; US military commanders stationed in Peiping and Tianjin, General Rockey, General Jones, and General Walden; and over 260 diplomatic personnel from allied nations. The Chairman and Madame Chiang slowly entered the venue at 4 PM, receiving a warm welcome and thunderous applause. During the event, the Chairman personally went to each table, shaking hands with the elderly gentry and inquiring about their health. Returning to his seat, he smiled and delivered a speech, expressing deep respect for the people of North China and individuals from all walks of life who had endured hardship and oppression under the enemy and puppet regimes for the past eight years, remaining steadfast and unyielding. He stated that this spirit truly represented the integrity of the nation and was the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance. He also expressed hope that everyone would maintain their past spirit, lead their compatriots, and assist the government to complete the great task of national reconstruction. After the speech, everyone applauded in unison. Mr. Zan Yunpeng stood up to respond, stating that today's tea party was a grand event in history, and that the nation, in the past ten years or more, had relied on Chairman Chiang's wise leadership to overcome a strong enemy and lay the foundation for the country. However, the great task of national reconstruction was just beginning, and he hoped that the Chairman would continue to lead China for another thirty years. (The crowd applauded greatly.) He said that if the entire nation, from top to bottom, worked together with one heart and devoted themselves to hard work, then in thirty years, China would surely become a modernized nation. The tea party concluded at around 5 PM in a joyful atmosphere. The Chairman and Madame Chiang shook hands with the guests to bid them farewell. It has been ten years since the Chairman last left Peiping in the 24th year of the Republic. After the War of Resistance, Peiping and Tianjin fell, and the people were in dire straits, longing for the Chairman's arrival like rain after a long drought. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the Chairman is the first to visit Peiping, and the morale of the people is imaginable. Therefore, the gentry and elders who were honored to be invited by the Chairman and Madame Chiang were all exceptionally excited. Mr. Jin Xinyun, who is seventy years old and originally resided in Tianjin, upon hearing of the Chairman's invitation, immediately flew from Tianjin to Peiping on the same day and finally arrived at the venue at around 4 PM to meet the Chairman, considering it a great honor. This further illustrates the love and support of the people of North China for the Chairman."</p>
<h3>Optimism about the Northeast Issue: American Newspaper Says US and Soviet Union Have Deep Understanding; Chairman Chiang to Inspect US Troops in Peiping This Morning</h3>
<p>"[Central News Agency, New York, 14th, United Press] The New York Times editorial commented on the arrival of Chinese troops in Changchun and Shenyang, and Chairman Chiang's arrival in Peiping, saying: This victory of the Chinese government is very important because the important thing is the bloodless victory. All these events have greatly increased the opportunity for China's unification and solidarity. Most importantly, it proves that both the Soviet Union and the United States have a deep understanding of China's situation, which will not only help to eliminate the Chinese civil war but also make the Far East issue hopeful for resolution. And the peace of the Far East will also be guaranteed. The speed of the Chinese government's promotion is largely due to the assistance of the United States and the Soviet Union. The newspaper concluded: The parallel military actions taken by the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East are an optimistic sign of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference. The peaceful resolution of the Chinese problem will lead to the negotiation of other problems that have recently caused suspicion and misunderstanding among all parties."</p>
<p>"[Our Newspaper News] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 15th: Mr. Liberman, a special correspondent for the New York Times in China, recently published all the facts about Chairman Chiang's arrival in Peiping. He said: 'Chairman Chiang's arrival in Peiping has two main purposes: (1) to discuss the Northeast issue with various leaders, and (2) to punish all illegal receiving officials.'"</p>
<p>"[United Press, Peiping, 15th] Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang are here, and there are no special security arrangements other than two soldiers stationed at each intersection. Street traffic has never been slightly blocked. Tomorrow morning, when the US Marine Corps troops stationed in China parade, the Chairman and his wife will participate in the inspection and personally award medals to meritorious US troops."</p>
<p>"[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] The Peiping City Chamber of Commerce Organization Committee believes that Peiping is the ancient capital of our country in all dynasties, a collection of cultural relics, and convenient for water and land transportation. Establishing the capital in Peiping will surely be the foundation for national reconstruction and revival. Therefore, seventeen members of the committee, including Sun Xisan, submitted a document to Chairman Chiang, stating their opinions on building the capital in Peiping and requesting adoption."</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo and Others Meet with Du Yuming: Sino-Soviet Military Handover Matters Have Satisfactory Results; Zhang Jia'ao Hosts Banquet for Key Soviet Personnel in Changchun</h3>
<p>"[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 15th] Chiang Ching-kuo, Chen Liang, Yang Mianzhong, and others came to Jinzhou from Peiping on the morning of the 15th to meet with Du Yuming and hold separate consultations on their respective responsible business. The Sino-Soviet military handover consultation, presided over by Chiang, has had satisfactory results. The commander has assigned three colonels and three translators to be the Shenyang Chifeng Zaoxin Three Liaison Groups, and the candidates have been internally determined. Chiang will bring them to Changchun, and after obtaining the consent of the Soviet side, they can start work. At noon, Du hosted a banquet to welcome Chiang and others. At 1 PM, Chiang and others flew directly to Changchun on the original plane."</p>
<p>"[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Zhang Jia'ao has scheduled a banquet at his official residence at 7 PM on the 15th. Those invited include Lieutenant General Ternozenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army; Colonel Slatkovsky, economic adviser to Marshal Malinovsky; Lieutenant General Kashangen, Deputy Director of Changchun Railway; Assistant Deputy Director Mariy; Director of Business Yefevsky Nieff, Major; Zilov; Supervisor Levasov; Supervisor Li Fangnuo; and Chiang Ching-kuo, Dong Yanping, Li Zefen, Qiu Xingxiang, Wang Cheng, Assistant Director of Changchun Railway; Wan Yi, Director of Personnel; and Geng Kuang, Director of General Affairs."</p>
<p>"[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] The establishment of a branch of the Central Bank here is currently being actively prepared and will be officially opened soon. At the same time, it will issue circulation notes for the nine provinces of the Northeast, which are divided into five types: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. All banknotes issued by the former puppet Manchukuo will be allowed to be used at par before they are actually withdrawn. The Administrative Economic Committee will soon issue the first notice to announce this matter. In addition, there are already four banks operating here, namely the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Yifa and Gongcheng commercial banks.

<h3>Rumor has it that Fu Zuoyi Arrived in Peiping from Suiyuan: Visited Chairman Chiang to Report on the Situation in Suiyuan and Baotou, Expressing Pain Over the Communist Army's Claim of Chaos</h3>
<p>"[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 14th] (Late Arrival) It is rumored that Commander Fu Zuoyi flew to Peiping from Guihua on the afternoon of the 13th and immediately visited Chairman Chiang that night to report on the bitter battle in Suiyuan and Baotou. It is rumored that Fu stayed here briefly before returning to Suiyuan. On the 14th, Fu Zuoyi met with reporters from this newspaper. According to him: After the enemy surrendered, I led the army to advance rapidly and had traveled two thousand miles by August 27th, reaching Datong. The Ping-Sui railway traffic was quickly restored, and the work of disarming the enemy was also completed quickly. All the people of Suiyuan were celebrating that they could finally recuperate, but they knew that unreasonable civil strife had arisen. Now, the two cities of Suiyuan and Baotou have suffered more than a month of bitter fighting. Although they have fortunately been unharmed, Fu Zuoyi (Fu said himself) is extremely distressed. In the past, when fighting against Japan, whenever Fu Zuoyi saw wounded brothers with broken legs and torn skin, he praised their loyalty and bravery without any sadness. Today, when he saw wounded brothers, Fu Zuoyi burst into tears and was overcome with grief, because the blood of these good men should not be shed in this way. Now that the Political Consultative Conference is about to be held, I deeply hope that a good solution can be discussed, and that we will not fight among ourselves and make our people suffer. After this battle, Suiyuan and Baotou have been severely damaged. Almost the entire railway has been dismantled, the telegraph poles have been pulled up by the Communist army to serve as ladders, many strong men in the countryside have been kidnapped, and food has been looted. Even if the Communist army withdraws in the future, it will not be easy to restore the original state."</p>

<h3>Journey to Paradise</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Glimpses of Oriental Venice</p>
<p>Every day I walk past the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road and see the iron railing door that is one person wide, with crowds of people outside clamoring and shouting. I always feel a little uncomfortable. I am quite surprised that people are so enthusiastic about traveling.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai train is indeed better than it was in early September. At that time, people were sitting on the roofs of the carriages, and people entered and exited through the windows. As soon as we arrived at the station, like a black whirlwind, hundreds of strong men with hand-carried packages swarmed out. Now we can't see this lively scene.</p>
<p>On the train, an old man said that he bought a second-class ticket to Suzhou for 1,500 yuan. He didn't feel frustrated. He kept shouting, "It's hard to come by!" "Unexpected!" Because he got a seat and could sit comfortably to Suzhou. Spending a few more dollars also bought a little comfort.</p>
<p>Two people who looked like service soldiers occupied eight seats. When people who couldn't find a seat asked them, they were turned back with the word "Someone." Among these people, occasionally one or two angrily said, "Do you reserve seats on the train?" The answer was "I'm reserving seats!" At this time, people like Lu Zhonglian came out to mediate. Lu Zhongyun was afraid that the seat-reservists would really get angry, and it was unfair to eat stray bullets from the side. When the train was about to leave, two officers came. There were four seats left. Two were immediately taken, and the other two had briefcases on them. There were at least fifteen people standing in this car. I watched coldly. I admired the two Gandhianists. After their full request to the officer was rejected, they were not discouraged. They stood on the seats with the briefcases, without saying a word. The train started, and the officer started a conversation and automatically took away the briefcases. The Gandhianists silently sat down, not even looking at them.</p>
<p>On this day, the rickshaw pullers in Suzhou were on strike because the owners increased the rent. It was very difficult to walk into the city from the station outside Pingmen. If you had luggage, it would be even more troublesome. A few horse-drawn carriages took the opportunity to raise prices, and there were also a few sedans with the names of institutions or military vehicles on them, occasionally doing some wild chicken business.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers rode tall horses on the road, looking like they were going for a spring outing.</p>
<p>Our officers, even a platoon leader of the county security team, were followed by a "Ma Sheng" with a box cannon. When the officer took out a cigarette, the "Ma Bian" immediately struck a match. Walking on the road, he was extremely nervous, almost treating every passerby as an assassin, and the box cannon was always ready to be pulled out. I thought to myself: How majestic!</p>
<p>It's more prosperous outside the door. I was chanting silently!</p>
<p>Lightly flowing water, long-lasting feelings; falling flowers are intentional, but fall to the ground silently.</p>
<p>The emotions in "Suzhou Night Talk" deeply infected me.</p>
<p>Not only outside _men, Guanqian is now also showing unprecedented prosperity. More than a dozen new restaurants have opened, and the hotels are also quite magnificent. During the occupied area, this was a city that never sleeps; after the victory of the War of Resistance, for the past two or three months, it has been just as brightly lit. Among them, there are still some past owners, but they have changed their badges and symbols.</p>
<p>Many small streets, many deep alleys, the kind of dead silence made people feel cold. The eight years of occupied life showed even more how this city was squeezed and exploited. The gentle homes of the Wu people seemed even more gentle, and even more happy, knowing their fate, and being content with their situation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of its proximity to Shanghai, the metropolis swallowed up the small county towns, and labor was concentrated in the cities, even women were no exception. My relatives' family could not hire a female immortal. It is said that the young people have all gone to Shanghai, and all that are left are old women over fifty years old.</p>
<p>The most miscellaneous troops wandered around in this area, discussing this kind of story in teahouses and hotels in twos and threes, extortion, robbery. In a small restaurant across from the military station, I even heard a lawsuit about robbing dozens of ducks.</p>
<p>If this city still has any vitality, it is the red and green slogans of "Welcome XXX"... that are plastered all over the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>Full of sorrow and killing, it is difficult for me to find facts to prove that this is paradise, this is the Oriental Venice. December 14th</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting: Amendment to Household Registration Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its 290th meeting of the fourth session on the 14th. Fifty-eight members attended, chaired by President Sun and Secretary-General Wu Shangying. The following important matters were passed: Amendment to the Household Registration Law. Key points of the content include: A. A census is a static survey of the population and differs in nature from household registration. Therefore, a separate Census Law should be formulated. Previously, censuses were conducted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, while registration of changes in personnel was handled by the Ministry of Interior. This resulted in a lack of administrative unity. This amendment specifically stipulates that the Ministry of Interior is the competent authority for censuses, and a separate Census Law will be formulated. B. Because it is difficult for registration personnel to handle statistics concurrently, it is stipulated that the competent authorities at all levels responsible for household registration should prepare various statistical tables and submit them to the superior competent authorities on a regular basis. C. The current system includes both temporary and permanent household registration. This amendment stipulates that temporary household registration is an exception to permanent registration, with flexible provisions made in Article 18 to maintain the effect of one person, one registration while retaining temporary registration. D. After completing registration, national identity cards will be issued. Article 11 stipulates that national identity cards may be issued in areas where household registration has been completed, or in areas approved by the Ministry of Interior. E.

(2) Facilities for news transmission should also be completely open. (3) Restrictions on the flow of news by the authorities should be reduced to the lowest possible level. Hubai said: If this plan can be implemented, it will be equivalent to a global bill of rights for the press.</p>
<h3>Azerbaijan Province: Virtually Independent from Iran: Iranian Issue to Be Discussed at the Three-Power Conference: Britain and the US Advocate that Iranian Troops Should Have Freedom of Action</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 15th] Azerbaijan Provincial Governor Bayat arrived here yesterday from Tabriz. Mr. Bayat said that the province has virtually broken away from Iran. It is also learned that Iranian troops, who were previously restricted by the Soviet Union from entering Azerbaijan Province, have been ordered to return to Tehran.

However, the Soviet government has expressed its unwillingness to accept this proposal. The British government's reply also [blank] that Britain believes that the stationing of Allied troops in Iran was originally for operational purposes only. Therefore, after receiving the U.S. note on withdrawing troops stationed in Iranian territory, the British side believed that the situation was pressing and immediately began to review the possibility of withdrawing troops before the deadline.

<h3>American Soldiers Bringing Back New Brides: Numbering Up to 100,000: British Brides Account for About Six-Tenths: They Can Become U.S. Citizens After Two Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Statistics show that the number of overseas American soldiers marrying foreign women has reached 100,000. It is currently impossible to predict how many new brides will reside in the United States for a long time. Approximately 21,000 people have filed entry requests. Starting from January next year, approximately 6,000 to 8,000 new brides will come to the United States each month to reunite with their husbands. Due to the limited cabin space on American ships, the number of people released is also restricted. U.S. Army officials said: According to estimates by the Bureau of Passports, there are approximately 60,000 British brides, 5,000 to 15,000 from various European countries, and 20,000 to 25,000 from Australia and New Zealand. A management office has been set up in the UK to receive these brides to the United States. According to current laws, brides who marry American soldiers can become U.S. citizens after two years.</p>
<h3>Hirohito Becomes an Isolated Emperor; 500 War Criminals to Soon Be Tried; A Huge Rope Newly Placed on the Gallows</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Since our chief representative arrived in Japan three and a half months ago, Emperor Hirohito has been an isolated and depressed figure, like an ancient tree battered by artillery fire, standing tall amidst the ruins of Tokyo. This Japan, once called an empire, is now an isolated, helpless, amputated effigy. Whether Hirohito abdicates or not is left unsaid, but it can be asserted that his situation is deteriorating. He is now isolated from the general Japanese public, and some Japanese are questioning the concept of the "inviolable god," setting a precedent in Japanese history. Three key figures who maintained contact with the public, Konoe, Kido, and Hiranuma, have been removed from the palace and imprisoned. The remaining cabinet, which still maintains some contact with the public, is weak and on its last breath. MacArthur has frozen a large portion of the assets of the Emperor and the imperial family, further limiting the Emperor's privileges. The Allied Command's threat to Hirohito is akin to the treatment of financial cliques. The imposition of war taxes will impoverish Hirohito, and even his own farmland will be sold to ordinary farmers under the newly revised land reform law. In addition, MacArthur plans to order the Japanese government to cease its support for Shintoism and abolish its privileges.</p>
<p>Japanese conservatives note that while the Emperor remains on the throne, his potential imprisonment is increasing. MacArthur's arrest warrant for Prince Higashikuni has shattered the Japanese people's hope that the imperial bloodline would be exempt from arrest and trial. MacArthur had previously stated that whether Emperor or commoner, avoiding trial as a war criminal was impossible. The upcoming major trials in Yokohama have made Japanese conservatives uneasy. Today's "Stars and Stripes" newspaper of the U.S. Army reported that a huge rope has been newly placed on the gallows in Sugamo Prison, where approximately 500 Japanese war criminals and others related to initiating the war are being held.</p>
<p>Crown Prince's Birthday Celebration Canceled</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The celebration for the 13th birthday of Crown Prince Akihito on the 23rd of this month has been canceled at the Emperor's request. This is the first time a national holiday has been canceled. The cancellation is said to be based on the imperial family's "serious plan."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Tokyo newspapers today published photos of Crown Prince Akihito going to school, with headlines stating that the Crown Prince is in good health and will graduate from the Gakushuin Elementary School next March. They also say that the Emperor is eager to ensure the Crown Prince learns the "way to be a person."</p>
<p>Japanese War Criminal in Hong Kong, Lieutenant Colonel Koga Arrested</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] Japanese war criminal Lieutenant Colonel Koga, formerly the warden of Stanley Prison in Hong Kong, has been arrested in Guangzhou and handed over to the British. He was flown to Hong Kong and imprisoned in the same cell in Stanley Prison. One of the war crimes Koga is accused of is ordering the execution of 33 out of 41 individuals in Stanley Prison on October 19, 1943, who were accused of smuggling medicine and food and transmitting information in and out of prisoner-of-war and internment camps. The trial was conducted by the Japanese without interpreters. According to a memorandum issued by the British Army authorities, Koga was responsible for inflicting torture on prisoners and killing the innocent. As a result of his tyranny, hundreds, if not thousands, of people died in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Kunshan-Jiao Zhi Ferries Robbed Simultaneously: The Kunshan-Jiao Zhi ferry was robbed by four plainclothes bandits armed with rifles near Zhangpu River Bend at around 10 AM on the 11th, with losses amounting to approximately one million yuan. On the same day, the Su-Kun ferry was also robbed by bandits in Xiedun, about five li from Jiao Zhi. None of the passengers escaped, and losses were extremely heavy. The authorities are currently investigating.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Public Association Responsible for Procuring Military Rice: The provincial committee has sent members to Changshu to procure 60,000 shi of military rice. Originally, 30,000 shi were to be handled by the Grain Public Association, and the rest by the village chiefs from the farmers. Due to the past abuses of using the Baojia system for rice procurement during the enemy puppet era, it was decided that the entire amount would be handled by the Public Association to avoid misunderstandings among the farmers. During the procurement period, the export of rice is prohibited to avoid affecting rice prices.</p>
<p>Sealed Materials to Be Sold at Reduced Prices: Wheat, rapeseed, and other perishable enemy puppet materials sealed in this county will be opened, sorted, and sold at reduced prices after the provincial committee member Fang Junyuan comes to Changshu to confer with the county government and various agencies. The proceeds will be used for local education, sanitation, and charitable causes.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Suggestion to Expedite Repair of Qingwu Highway: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, noting the severe damage to highway bridges in various counties, has dispatched members to inspect and supervise repairs. Yesterday, members Wang Shihong and Lin Xiaofang, accompanied by Hu Tingji, head of the Construction Section of the County Government, went from Wuxi to Chengjiang to inspect the Xicheng and Qingwu Roads. Due to the severe damage to the Qingwu Road, the committee members are temporarily stationed in Qingyang to supervise the urgent repairs, which are to be completed by the 20th of this month. The Qingwu Road runs from Qingyang in Jiangyin to Henglin Town in Wujin. Most of the bridges along the road have been destroyed and need to be repaired, which may not be completed in a short time.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>All Circles Bid Farewell to Commander Gu: Commander Gu Shitong of the Third War Area stationed his troops in Hangzhou immediately after the Japanese surrender. Now, having received orders for a promotion, he is about to leave Hangzhou. Gu held a tea party at his official residence the other day to entertain leaders from all walks of life, and various circles have scheduled a farewell for tomorrow. Gu's departure is imminent. A portion of his troops will accompany Gu, while the rest will leave Hangzhou successively.</p>
<p>High Court Actively Trying Traitors: Cases of punishing traitors in Zhejiang Province have now been concentrated in the High Court, with no fewer than five or six hundred pending cases. Court sessions are being held day and night, with most resulting in death sentences or life imprisonment. Defendants are allowed to hire experienced lawyers to defend them, and those who cannot afford to hire lawyers are assigned lawyers by the court for free. Recently, many cases have been transferred to Hangzhou from various places, causing overcrowding in the prisons.</p>
<h3>U.S. Loan to Finland - $5 Million - For Importing U.S. Cotton</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 15th] The Export-Import Bank announced today that it has signed an agreement with the Finnish government and the Bank of Finland to provide a loan of $5 million to help Finland import approximately 46,000 bales of U.S. cotton. This loan to Finland is the first allocation of the $100 million total loan the Export-Import Bank decided in October to provide to European countries for purchasing U.S. cotton. The term of the loan for Finnish cotton is 15 months, the maximum period under the cotton export loan agreement. The loan interest rate will be 2.5% per week.</p>
<h3>President Truman's Salary Problem</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 14th] President Truman's annual salary is only $75,000, while his expenses are enormous. If he does not make efforts to economize, he will surely be heavily in debt when he leaves office. White House Secretary Daniel recently published an article in Collier's magazine listing President Truman's unavoidable daily expenses. The minimum expenses are as follows: 1. Federal taxes $46,000; 2. Private expenses at the White House $25,000; 3. Missouri state taxes $1,000, totaling $72,000. After deducting the above expenses, there remains $3,000 to cover all other expenses. It is possible to spend all of his salary in a single week. Such expenses include the cost of food for the president's family and private guests, private tea party expenses, family cleaning and laundry fees, clothing purchases, and donations to the Democratic Party. In addition, President Truman's enthusiastic purchase of war bonds has set an example for the country, and he is constantly invited to speak by various fee-paying organizations and urged to assist by charitable organizations, leaving him no respite. If he accedes to every request, the President's annual salary could be spent in any given week. Of all the U.S. presidents, only Taft expressed dissatisfaction with the annual salary of $75,000. He told President Wilson that he managed to accumulate $100,000 in salary after four years, which was quite an achievement. However, even if the expenses of the White House today were the same as they were in Taft's time, President Truman would be fortunate to leave office with only $100,000 in debt, because President Truman has to pay $200,000 in federal and state taxes during his four-year term, while there was no such burden in Taft's time, so his savings were not entirely due to thrift. Presidents Roosevelt, Hoover, and Harding all had private wealth, Coolidge was exceptionally frugal, and Wilson's second wife was wealthy. Only President Truman has no private savings. Serving as President of the United States is the most difficult job in the world, but in terms of income, although the reputation is good, the salary is almost entirely returned to the people through taxes and the costs of living in the White House.</p>

<h3>The Days of Blood, the Cases of Blood: Ironclad Evidence of the Nanjing Massacre</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>The world's poetic saint Dante had an eternal masterpiece, called "Inferno." Our Buddha Sakyamuni also told sentient beings that there is a hell in the human world. — But may I ask: Where is hell?</p>
<p>I will answer you: It is here.</p>
<p>I recently went to Nanjing and witnessed the tombs burying tens of thousands of corpses. I met survivors who had personally experienced the events eight years ago. Bringing up the old matters made my nerves twitch, and my speech was trembling. Not only that, but even as I write this dispatch, my pen is still shaking with my hand.</p>
<p>The Enemy Only Knew How to Kill</p>
<p>The 13th of this month was the eighth anniversary of the fall of Nanjing. When I arrived in Nanjing, which I had not seen for many years, a feeling of immense desolation washed over me. I immediately visited the Nanjing War Crimes Investigation Committee and learned that their investigation work is currently underway and proceeding smoothly, but they have very few staff. To date, they have collected over three hundred reports and documents. As I examined these documents, a hellish picture emerged before my eyes.</p>
<p>Li Mingwu, 59, an employee of the Chongshantang, has lived a hard life for the past eight years and is thin and frail. His son is currently serving in Chengdu. At that time, he and a group of elderly people, supported by their blended Buddhist-Taoist faith, bravely went to bury corpses, braving the enemy's insults and threats. He told me:</p>
<p>"The enemy only knew how to kill and never buried a single corpse."</p>
<p>He listed numerous atrocities he had witnessed and provided them to the Investigation Committee.</p>
<p>Women Were All Brutally Violated</p>
<p>Their sworn statements submitted to the Investigation Committee stated:</p>
<p>South Gate Bridge: Three women around the age of twenty, the upper part of their underclothes intact, their hands gripping their waistbands, the lower part of their underclothes torn, like disheveled silk, their eyes gouged out, their ears and noses cut off. They were subjected to torture and died for refusing to be raped. Their names are unknown.</p>
<p>There were as many as nine cases of women with separated limbs, staring angrily to their death, in places like Sanfang Lane and Huashi in Xinjekou, in the city.</p>
<p>In a thatched hut on the east side of the city wall inside Xingzhong Gate, there was an old woman in her sixties or seventies, her lower body swollen and broken, having been gang-raped to death.</p>
<p>A girl, about twelve or thirteen years old, lying on the side of the road behind Guyilang, her underclothes torn, her eyes closed and mouth open, dead.</p>
<p>By the roadside on Banshan Street, there were seven women around the ages of forty and sixty or seventy, their breasts pierced, their hair disheveled, their underclothes torn, their heads raised, their eyes wide open, their mouths open and teeth bared, dead.</p>
<p>A girl, about thirteen or fourteen years old, was lying dead north of Yangpi Lane, her abdomen ripped open, her intestines pulled out, her eyes wide open, bleeding from her mouth.</p>
<p>Below Huangni Ridge, there were over eighty male corpses and six female corpses lying scattered about. There were also two corpses of children. All had been stabbed to death with knives.</p>
<p>I casually perused a few sworn statements, and the tragic scenes on the streets of Nanjing at that time immediately became clear.</p>
<h3>Material Evidence and Testimony Confoundingly Mixed; The Cunning Enemy's Crimes Cannot Be Concealed</h3>
<p>It must be pointed out here that these were all women and children. Japanese fascists created "achievements" on their bodies as a foundation for the "Greater East Asia New Order." But this was merely a small-scale massacre. The large-scale massacre was carried out after the occupation of Nanjing was announced. This is ironclad evidence of a planned massacre.</p>
<p>According to the "Battle Traces and Scenic Spots of Nanjing" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, the number of "enemy" corpses abandoned was 53,874. The Japanese propaganda department is known for its skill in lying, and this time was no exception, but instead of exaggerating the "achievements," it downplayed them. This is because the number of "enemies" who died under their bayonets, bullets, and rapes, including women, children, youth, and prisoners of war, is simply unbelievable, but the published figure is less than 20%.</p>
<p>That booklet shamelessly wrote, "The Imperial Army achieved unprecedented great victories." Yes, this is the consequence of fascism!</p>
<p>According to the report of the Nanjing Red Swastika Society, they buried corpses between December 22nd, burying 129 corpses on the back mountain of Qingliang on the first day, and 109 corpses on Wangjiangji outside Zhonghua Gate. On December 28th, they collected 6,468 corpses at one time and buried them in Pude Temple outside Zhonghua Gate. Later, the number gradually increased to 9,721. Their work continued until the summer of the following year and was not yet completed. By the end of October, they finally summarized the numbers, totaling 43,071 male and female corpses. In addition, Chongshantang had a report that they organized four burial teams and worked for four months, burying a total of 112,267 corpses. Just adding these two numbers together, there are 155,338 corpses buried. When I first saw this number, I was simply shocked and incredulous: Could such a thing really happen in the world? And it happened in Nanjing. But this is indeed a fact, an ironclad fact. There are also the cremated corpses and other privately buried corpses, which are not included. But in any case, this number is already so far from the Japanese military's report, and this is also an ironclad fact. How could these "enemy" corpses exceed the published "achievements"? Clearly, there is a conspiracy, a cruel, vicious, and bloody story contained within, which the Japanese criminals are trying to cover up.</p>
<p>Now we can also present witnesses to accuse the crimes committed under the direct guidance of the criminal Iwane Matsui. We, the citizens of Nanjing, should have the right to come and try Iwane Matsui and declare his doom.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Fascist Army's Masterpiece: Large-Scale Mass Murder</h3>
<p>Xiaguan is a painful term. The other day I met Lu Su, the inspector of the police department at that time, who had participated in street fighting. After being injured by bombing in Sanpailou on the 12th, he endured the pain and walked to Yijiangmen, climbing into the city.</p>
<p>He recorded his experiences at the time, writing:</p>
<p>"...After arriving at Shangwen Gate, the houses along the way had all been burned down. In the cold winter months, the north wind was biting. I hid in a pile of wheat straw, drinking river water to quench my hunger, struggling until the morning of the 16th. I saw a villager washing a summer cloth in the river. I called him over and asked about the situation outside. He said that there were many refugees living in Damaodong in Laohushan, about a mile away. I paid him seven yuan to carry me to the entrance of the cave. There were six policemen there, preparing breakfast with a bucket of porridge... The enemy was searching nearby, driving the cave dwellers to the roadside. The young men were dragged out one by one, and they said, 'Chinese soldiers,' and immediately shot more than twenty people. The six policemen were also unable to escape. I squatted on the ground, shouting several times, but they ignored me, continuing to serve the porridge. Fortunately, the order to assemble was given, and they abandoned me and left. That night, I was still in the cave. My fellow refugees treated each other like brothers, placing the young men at the bottom of the cave, while the white-haired children stayed at the entrance. The Japanese Kou came to search again, dragging away six people and stabbing them to death with bayonets on the river bank. That night, there was heavy machine gun fire in the Caoxie Gorge area, about twenty or thirty machine guns, for three consecutive hours. I suspected that the National Army was launching a counterattack. The next day, before dawn, two bloody people came, one being Squad Leader Feng of the Training Corps and the other being Guard Guo of the Security Team. They described their experience, and I learned that after the enemy entered the city, they had rounded up 57,410 prisoners of war and civilian refugees of both sexes, and ages, and confined them in several small villages under Mount Mufu, cutting off their food and drink, and many died of cold and starvation. On the night of the 16th, they used wire or rope to tie the legs of two people together, tied into bunches, formed four lines, and drove them to Caoxie Gorge in Xiaguan, where they were all mowed down with machine guns. At this time, the victims courageously shouted, 'Seize the guns, seize the guns!' so that corpses piled up like mountains, and the enemy again attacked with bayonets, and finally poured kerosene and set them on fire. Feng and Guo pretended to lie on the ground, covering their bodies with corpses. Feng was still stabbed in his right arm, and both of their clothes were burned... Honest people around the world: What kind of scene is this!"</p>
<p>This was not the only mass slaughter; this planned massacre took place throughout the city of Nanjing, meaning that the slaughter by the Japanese invaders on Chinese soil was of unprecedented scale. I have already pointed out the evidence that the enemy deliberately concealed their crimes, and these large numbers are only corroborating this point.</p>
<p>Xu Jingsen, a victim who lived at No. 4, Wutiaoxiang, Gulou, reported another mass slaughter. He wrote:</p>
<p>"On the morning of December 16, 1937, four enemy soldiers rushed into my house, searching for young men, and abducted dozens of young men living together. At that time, I witnessed groups of young people placed in Dafangxiang Square, arriving one after another. By dusk, there were tens of thousands of people (Miss Hua of Jinling University had accurate statistics). The enemy took four or five hundred people whose clothing was insufficient, and massacred them with machine guns near a pond. The rest were driven away, and those who fell behind were also shot."</p>
<p>This is another example of a large-scale collective slaughter. Another report stated:</p>
<p>"I personally witnessed the crimes of the enemy as follows: There was a young man named Xia Taisheng. On the afternoon of November 14, 1937, several enemy soldiers came to my house at the West Road entrance of the refugee area and forcibly dragged him away. Xia Taisheng, along with a group of young people, was escorted by enemy soldiers to the riverside in Xiaguan, where he was shot with machine guns."</p>
<p>This is an example of the slaughter of young people.</p>
<h3>Corpses and Tombs Throughout the City</h3>
<p>As I write this, I feel ashamed, pained, and resentful. As a journalist recording history in the civilized age of the twentieth century, how could I have recorded such human behavior? Does anyone want to know what fascism is? To understand its political, economic, cultural, and military theories? Then this is it. Fascism is war, is beastliness, is slaughter! Fascism has now been declared to be at its end, but the tragic experience of mankind must be forever remembered and deeply pondered by every honest person in the world.</p>
<p>Corpses buried in suburban areas account for 62% of the total. At first, I did not understand the reason. Citizens who personally experienced it helped me solve this problem.</p>
<p>When the enemy troops were gathering their forces to attack the city, these massacres had not yet unfolded on a large scale. The people in the suburbs who had no chance to escape were later unable to enter the refugee area within the city (which was delineated by the International Committee organized by Miss Hua Qun and Bates after negotiating with the enemy army). They gathered in one place during the day, helping each other, but after being discovered, most of them met with disaster. They witnessed that these corpses were mostly shot in the back and died lying on the ground, and there were also some who were stabbed to death and lay sideways in pools of blood. In particular, the Japanese invaders often searched at night, and the people - especially the women - fled the villages in separate groups. When they heard gunshots, they hid in the haystacks. When the sky was bright, the Japanese invaders would look down from the heights and immediately discover them and shoot them with machine guns. The enemy invaders pursued them all over the mountains, and the faster women ran the denser the gun fire, resulting in more casualties.</p>
<h3>Sixty-Six-Year-Old Man Bitterly Recounts Tragic Experiences</h3>
<p>Now, let's hear from Yi Yu, the director of Chongshan Hall. He is sixty-six years old this year, with paralyzed legs and difficulty walking. He was the person in charge of burying 110,000 corpses. He spoke with me twice, and I find it hard to believe that this ailing old man has done so much. I think someone like him should receive a government medal. Recently, he summarized and said:</p>
<p>"In the urban areas, there were more corpses with knife wounds than bullet wounds. In the suburbs, it was about the same. Wherever there was a female corpse, male corpses were found relatively far away. In the urban areas, corpses were often found in basements and at street corners. In rural areas, they were lying in the hundreds or dozens in drainage ditches, ponds, under the ridges of fields, and in the middle of haystacks. The scene was indescribably tragic, especially for the women. Some died resisting rape. Their faces were blue-black, their teeth were falling out, their cheeks were broken, blood flowed from their mouths, their breasts were cut off, their chests and abdomens were pierced, their intestines were dragging out, their lower abdomens were kicked, and their lower bodies were stabbed repeatedly with bayonets, to the point of being torn apart, their vaginas swollen and festering, and their lower abdomens bulging like..." The above two situations applied to young women around twenty years old and old women of sixty or seventy. There were even girls who were sodomized..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou didn't want to say anymore. He shook his head, remained silent for a moment, and continued, "It was truly a catastrophe! These beasts!"</p>
<p>This is a true picture of the Japanese invaders' cruelty to women.</p>
<p>The empty spaces inside and outside Nanjing were almost entirely filled with buried corpses. Now, Nanjing is filled with bright lights, revelry, and extravagant displays, more lavish than ever before. I have been visiting various tombs for days, and I cannot help but shed tears for those who suffered cruel killings by the Japanese invaders. Because they were buried hastily at the time, most of them had no markers and were exposed. Now, I will list the burial sites I have investigated below:</p>
<p>Wutaishan, from Hongtu Bridge to Beijige, east end of Zhuhqiao behind Guanyin Temple, north of Gu Bridge, Wolong Bridge Floating Building, city wall of Dazhong Bridge in Santiao Lane, east end of the park, north of the Floating Bridge area, foot of Fugui Mountain, east city wall of Yijiangmen, east city wall of Zhonghua Gate, city wall from Xingzhongmen to Xiaodongmen, city wall from Xiaofenfu to Lianziying, city wall from Dashu Cheng to Lanjiazhuang, barren vegetable gardens near the rain flower Flower God Temple outside Zhonghua Gate, barren vegetable gardens near Shanghe outside Shuixi Gate, barren vegetable gardens near Xiaoshanmen to Maqun, barren vegetable gardens near Tongjimen to Fangshan, Hou Mountain of Qingliang, Jinling University Farm, Qingliang Mountain Cemetery, Han Jiaxiang Xicang Mountain, Gulin Temple Mountain, Yinyangying South Xiu Village, North Xiu Village, Wangjiangji outside Zhonghua Gate, Gao Pi Bai Village, Pude Temple, Shangxinhe Black Bridge, Sandao Ganzi outside Shuixi Gate, Shangxinhe Sun Palace, Nansan Lane outside Shuixi Gate, Shangxinhe Er Geng, Shangxinhe Jiangdong Bridge, Shangxinhe Cotton Embankment, Guangdong Cemetery outside Hanxi Gate, Great King Temple outside Shuixi Gate, Xiaguan Dugu Lane, Central Stadium Cemetery, Shangxinhe Central Prison, Shangxinhe Guanyin Nunnery Open Space, Fenghuang Street Open Space, Erdao Ganzi outside Hanzhong Gate, Shangxinhe Beihekou Open Space, Jiujia Peng in Xiaguan, next to the Xiaguan Torpedo Military Camp, Xiaguan Caoxie Gorge Open Space, Xiaguan Torpedo Military Camp Pier, Xiaguan Shiliu Garden, below Mufu Mountain, Shangxinhe Wufu Village, Xiaguan Jiangjia Garden, Xiaguan East Battery, empty spaces inside and outside Shangyuan, southwest empty space of Sanwen River, next to Yongqing Temple outside Heping Gate, riverside of Xiaguan Coal Port, embankment behind Xiaguan Naval Hospital, Shangxinhe Ganlu Temple Open Space, top of Hua Peng Temple Mountain outside Zhonghua Gate, city wall outside Taiping Gate, west mountain of Anderli outside Zhonghua Gate, Shangxinhe Jiajia Mulberry Garden Open Space, riverside of Xiaguan Military Station, edge of Lao Jiangkou, riverside of Xiaguan Jiangtan.</p>
<h3>Traitor Gao Guanwu Erects a Stele; The Souls of the Dead Cannot Rest in Peace</h3>
<p>The traitor Gao Guanwu (Municipal Superintendent of the puppet Reformed Government) also collected more than 3,000 skeletons in the Ma'anshan Linggu Temple area, deeply burying them in the east side of Linggu Temple, creating a rather beautiful "Tomb of Ownerless Lonely Souls" and engraving a stele with an inscription. When he came to collect the bones, it was already December of the 27th year [1938]. The corpses of the murdered only had bones remaining, and the large-scale burial work in Nanjing had already been done by the people. Gao Guanwu shamelessly wrote on the stele:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you suffered the chaos of the times, your flesh and blood nourished the wilderness, your bones were left on the mounds, whether as soldiers or civilians, men or women, old or young, with or without descendants, none can know. The greatest pain in life is to live without support and die without mourning, especially for those like you whose bones lie exposed and without support. Although life and death are ordained, and the length of life is determined, inquiring as if violating human principles, Peng and Shang can be equalized, all return to dust. What people strive for is not the brevity of years, but the immortal virtues and spirit..."</p>
<p>Bah! This is simply the greatest insult, and it contains a propaganda of peaceful conspiracy. He emphasizes "bones lying exposed and without support," which is tantamount to saying that they were well-massacred by the Japanese invaders. This stele is still standing there. If it is not destroyed, and the traitors are not killed, the souls of these victims will not be able to rest in peace for a single day.</p>
<p>After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Chinese prisoners of war in Nanjing were liberated. Among them were those who had been captured in Nanjing, now only thirty-six in number. But they included almost all units that participated in the street fighting in Nanjing at the time. They told me the most cruel story: the Japanese invaders burned alive two thousand people, including prisoners of war and civilians, on Purple Mountain. This day was December 12th, the day before the fall of Nanjing.</p>
<p>It is not easy to ascertain the exact number of people killed by the Japanese invaders, but according to my on-site investigation, the estimated figure is at least 250,000 people successively murdered on land, and 100,000 people directly or indirectly murdered in the river. The Japanese invaders' reporting department claimed: "The naval forces, after opening the Yangtze River, arrived at Xiaguan on the evening of the 13th, and the elite of the army and navy were completely deployed."</p>
<p>The massacre at Xiaguan was precisely the "masterpiece" of the Japanese army and navy. In order to clearly and understandably hold trials, it is necessary to severely try them, and in order to wash away the great shame of humanity, it is also necessary to severely try them.

<h3>Small Airplanes Displayed in New York Department Stores</h3>
<p>Inside a New York department store, a single-seat private airplane is on display, named "Ercoupe," priced at $995, and reservations can be made at the store. The wings are twenty feet long, and with a full tank of gas, it can fly for three hours. The engine is 55 horsepower, consuming three gallons of fuel per hour. The normal speed is 100 to 105 miles per hour, and the maximum speed is 115 to 120 miles per hour. The entire body is made of metal.</p>
<h3>How Tragic This Scene!</h3>
<p>The stubborn and wicked Japanese soldiers, at the end of 1937, with their ammunition full, massacred hundreds of thousands of defenseless citizens of Nanjing. This massacre can truly serve as a typical example of the Japanese invasion of China. (Top) The image shows: The tragic state of the Chinese people after being brutally killed, their intestines dragged out, even women and children could not escape their bitter fate. (Bottom) The image shows: The Japanese army created a dark and terrifying world, yet they "boasted" of their "great achievements." (A gift publication from the News World Society)</p>
<p>Sunday Forum</p>
<h3>On the Kunming Student Protests</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>The Kunming student protests began on the evening of November 25th with a speech meeting at the four major universities. The topic was opposition to the civil war, and more than 6,000 teachers and students attended. The speech was not finished when the lights were cut off, and gunfire erupted outside the wall, with bullets flying like hailstones. The meeting ended prematurely, and the students were greatly angered. They claimed that the government was interfering with freedom of assembly and speech, and they rallied and called for action, and their momentum grew stronger. Conflicts between students from the Second Army Officer Corps and students from major universities were frequently heard. On December 1st, hand grenades caused casualties. The perpetrators were soon identified as Chen Qida and Liu Youzhao, and they were arrested, both retired soldiers. Their confessions were suspicious, and suspicions grew even more. One side said it was a plot by reactionary elements to provoke discord, while the other side believed that it was instigated by special forces. Chairman Chiang issued a telegram to the students urging them to resume classes, but initially, it did not have much effect. The Provincial Garrison Commander Guan Linzheng resigned, or rather, it seemed that way in writing. Finally, the main culprits who threw the grenades were brought to justice, and the anger subsided somewhat. Alas! Who did it? Who caused it? Since the May Fourth Movement, this type of phenomenon has been commonplace. But in the early days of constitutional government, how should it be explained? What kind of cause and effect does it have? Different people have different views. Based on my humble knowledge, I would like to offer my opinions.</p>
<p>Recently, the government has proclaimed the implementation of constitutional government, and the preparations of institutions and the exhortations of proclamations are almost all that are required. But in reality, has the end of tutelage government and the beginning of constitutional government reached a point where water flows to form a canal? What is the government's true intention? What are the people detecting from the government? Anyone on the street can tell you: constitutional government is just a name, and the government's true intention is definitely not this. The officials surrounding the government tell each other: constitutional government is just a name, and the head of state's true intention is definitely not this. Even the strategists who lead the trend whisper: constitutional government is just a name, we are using this name to deceive people, and the true level of the people is not worth considering. They come with a name, we respond with a name, creating a chaotic situation, like a hostage situation. Taking this case as an example: from the garrison commander to the students of the military officer corps, how could they not know that freedom of speech is the foundation of constitutional government, and that the country has no explicit laws to suppress dissent, and what is wrong with opposing the civil war? But there is a hidden mastermind who believes that suppressing speech, restricting freedom, and suppressing the anti-civil war faction to prevent them from advocating for the Communists is the central government's true intention, and it is their duty. Even if the government is bound by public opinion and pressured by foreign countries, it cannot but deem this action wrong, so it approves it secretly while condemning it openly. The path to fame and fortune lies in this, so what is there to fear not doing? On the other hand, a few cunning individuals today are exploiting the weaknesses of young people, using names as a pretext, and recklessly inciting. Once they achieve their goals, the system will be at stake, and what they once opposed will become forbidden, and they will even become more unscrupulous, turning the power and position into something inevitable. As the saying goes: if the father kills, the son will rob. By examining similar cases, we can know what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>Cao Cao issued an order to seek talent, specifically looking for those who could use gold to buy talented people to serve the world. Official positions were established, such as the Colonel of Gold and the General Who Excavates Tombs. This made serving as emperor and waging war into one thing. There is probably no second emperor who did this. However, its effectiveness is more direct than seeking talent while plotting to steal. As the Book of Rites says: Yao and Shun led the world with benevolence, and the people followed them. Jie and Zhou led the world with tyranny, and the people followed them. If what they commanded was contrary to what they loved, the people would not follow. The Han Dynasty's Fifth Lun said: Those who teach by example are followed, and those who teach by words are debated. The Song Dynasty's Su Shi also said: The people do not follow the orders of their superiors, but their intentions. If there is disharmony between words and actions, or if there is a clear discrepancy between orders and intentions, stubbornly adhering to the words and orders to control the people, and if the signs and phenomena of contradiction are everywhere, like a beast trapped in mud, impossible to hide, how can one win the hearts of the people and unify their will? I don't know.</p>
<p>If the above principles are clear, the crux of the matter is obvious. Who would dare to say that the Kunming student protests were definitely a way to outwardly defy the government's orders but secretly fulfill the government's intentions? And yet the people of the world are talking, and everyone is watching, and they have broken the government's intentions and orders into two pieces. Even if they had the tongues of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, they could not argue. I clearly do not understand why this is the case. Mencius said: How can the world be at peace? It is settled by unity. I believe that the heroes of the past were able to unify the world. Someone like Chairman Chiang today is hard to find in ancient and modern times. First, he led the people to fight bitterly for eight years, saving the country from the brink of extinction. Then, he used determination to lay the foundation for the country's ten thousand years of future, advancing the country to the realm of freedom and equality. Without the previous determination, there would be no way to begin the latter determination; all of the latter determination would continue the previous determination. Words are like ropes, and achievements are like mountains and rivers. What benefit is there in not showing sincerity to heaven and future generations? If we know that Su Zidan's words are outdated and that someone is executing the highest orders incompletely, not examining and restraining their own actions, leading to doubts and slanders arising invisibly, and spreading confusion among the masses, then there is no other reason.</p>
<p>Then what can be done? I say: All affairs of the family and the country cannot be done without being literate. Sincerity leads to clarity, and clarity leads to sincerity. How to handle this case is but a trivial matter. Even if the facts are slightly different, it does not matter much. I only hope that honesty will help the authorities to be clear and to increase their future sincerity. Thus, the great clarity and sincerity of the head of state will shine throughout the world and never fade. As for the people not knowing how to make good use of freedom, everyone knows that. Unlimited freedom, closely following ten years of tutelage government restraints, also tends to be chaotic and without restraint, leading to unruliness. How to properly control this, starting with the perfection of constitutional government, is another question, which I will discuss further later.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>New Exchange Rate Expected to be Announced Next Week; US Dollars and Gold Bullion Both See Firmness</h3>
<p>B-Type Bonds Briefly Surpass 600 Mark</p>
<p>According to reports, the new exchange rate has been decided by the Supreme Economic Council, and will be announced within the next week. People have different views on the exchange rate (similar to that provided in the fourth issue of the Economic Weekly) for US dollar cash, with varying approaches and slight hesitation. The market opened with the momentum from the previous close, and short selling was rampant, with prices falling to 700,300. Banks saw low prices and gradually purchased, maintaining the 700,000 mark. Prices gradually stabilized. By noon, short sellers covered their positions, briefly pushing prices up to over 730,000. In the end, it stagnated with no significant changes, closing slightly up 5,000 from the previous close. Gold jewelry was priced at 78,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars remained between 440 and 450. Black market discounts were sluggish due to speculation, falling to 6% and 8%.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: US dollars, with the difference between the closing price of gold bullion in the wartime capital and cash reaching 685 yuan per ten taels, and rumors that the general view of the new exchange rate in that area would not exceed 1,350 yuan, prompted sellers. The market opened below 1,200 yuan, and arbitrage sales increased, reaching a low of 1,165 yuan. At this time, the arbitrage spread had narrowed to over 600 yuan. The gold market in Taiwan recovered, and major players rushed to buy, gradually rising back to over 1,220 yuan. The result was no significant change from the previous close. The supply and demand of Hong Kong dollars were balanced. Guangdong dealers were gradually paying attention to old goods, slightly up from the previous day, while new goods remained flat.</p>
<p>Securities: Public bonds were initially very quiet. When internal bonds were about to fall below the 500 yuan mark, major players in the market purchased to maintain the price, gradually showing improvement. By noon, a certain bank on Sichuan Road suddenly sold a large amount of gold and purchased bonds, aggressively purchasing over 5 million B-type bonds. The narrow price market suddenly saw a spectacle, surging to over 600 yuan. However, unpopular miscellaneous stocks were unable to keep up due to time constraints, and the price difference widened significantly. The result was an increase of 15 to 80 yuan from the previous day. The trend is under manipulation, and efforts will be made to raise prices further.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bank gradually attracted the attention of major players, so large stocks were quite firm. Smaller stocks lacked sustained power from retail investors, and were quite popular in the middle of the day, but were sold off at the close. As a result, the Shanghai Cotton Mill and American Asian Corporation rose from the previous close, while the three small mills saw slight declines.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained stable, hovering around the opening price. Affected by the gold market, they were sluggish, but there was no shortage of investors buying at low prices. Therefore, each unpopular stock was bid for at 10% lower than the closing price.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Market "Situation"</h3>
<p>Grains Slightly Weak: Yesterday, all grains saw declines. Rice market production prices remained firm, but the Shanghai market was sluggish, with production and consumption moving in opposite directions. White japonica and indica rice saw a decline of 100 to 200 yuan, but white yuan rice was the only bright spot, with prices rising 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market was similar, fluctuating up and down. Shipments from Qingdao continued to arrive, and sentiment softened, with prices falling by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply and demand of flour was weak, and the market was stable. Actual consumption of yellow soybeans was sluggish, with prices down a small amount of 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were still being increased for slaughter. Soybean cake was flat at 100 yuan. Wine prices were stable, with few arrivals and sales.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Stable: Yesterday, the yarn market briefly fell by 10,000 to 20,000 in the morning, but then recovered as local dealers were keen to purchase 16-count yarn, and prices rose. The result was 10,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The trend of fine yarn and thread was quite mediocre, about 20,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The ups and downs of 10-count and 20-count yarn were mixed. The yarn market is currently in a period of consolidation.</p>
<p>Foreign Tea Merchants Active: The tea market is driven by tea factories rushing to produce foreign tea, which is in high demand, and local and Suzhou-Wuxi dealers are continuing to sell, and the market is firm. Local foreign tea merchants are preparing for export trade, and have decided to standardize products, dividing them into three grades: superior, medium, and secondary. Superior black tea is Qimen, green tea is Longjing, and scented tea is Huizhou baked tea. Medium and secondary grades are limited to ordinary market sales. In the future, transactions will be based on the above-mentioned product names.</p>
<p>Coal Sales Soften: Although coal sales are gradually becoming more active, the underlying trend is still softening. Following the Jin-Hu line in Zhenjiang and other places, it was previously heard that coal prices in Shanghai were high, and people rushed to collect coal stored in that area and transport it to Shanghai, waiting for good prices. Now that it has arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai coal price has rebounded, making it even more difficult for the coal market to recover. A large batch of dry pine firewood from Ningbo has arrived, priced at around 900 yuan, making it even harder to sell the previously arrived damp firewood, and prices have fallen again.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Black dates and walnuts are supported by customer demand, and the market is firm. A large number of spring bamboo shoots were loaded on the China Prosperity Wheel, but unfortunately it sank in a thunderstorm, so prices are still stable, but the trend is still weak. The impact of gold prices is making people uncertain about foreign miscellaneous and seafood products, leading to less trading. Since the offering of glutinous rice branches, the initial asking prices were too high, so it did not open. However, only a small number of self-operated goods were sold at 123,000 yuan, making it difficult to guarantee capital. Yesterday, a batch was finally opened, priced at 145,000 yuan. After sorting out broken shells, it is estimated that it will need to be sold for 180,000 yuan to be profitable. Regarding the sugar market, the initial plan was to load flour to Taiwan in exchange for sugar, but the Taiwanese authorities prohibited sugar exports, so it was unsuccessful. Furthermore, the China Prosperity Wheel had an accident in transit, resulting in significant losses, so the sugar market is tight.</p>
<h3>Stock of Cloth: 1.4 Million Bolts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Among the various enemy and puppet materials, approximately 40,000 bolts of cloth have been sold at a low price since the flat sale. 50,000 bolts were shipped to Chongqing and 100,000 bolts to Taiwan, totaling less than 200,000 bolts. However, the suppression of market prices has been quite effective. It is rumored that there are still 1.2 million bolts in stock. Since the reopening of the city's textile factories, production has reached more than 100,000 bolts, and this does not include the clothing cloth supplied by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The supply of cotton cloth is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Two Major Textile Companies: Both Organized</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special News] Recently, two major textile companies have been established in this city. One is the Zhongxin Textile Company, with a capital of 450 million legal tender, which is a joint-stock company, all subscribed by the promoters Chen Hanwen and others in one go, without further share offerings. The other company is the Damei Textile Enterprise Co., Ltd., initiated by Wang Xiaolai and others, with a capital of 500,000 yuan, all subscribed by the promoters in one go, specializing in the business of machine cotton, silk, wool, silk, and rayon textiles, and related businesses.</p>
<h3>Commercial Registration Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The person in charge of the Industry and Commerce Registration Office of the Social Affairs Bureau recently told reporters that this city-wide industry and commerce registration does not include companies, so it is planned to be completed within six months. Therefore, the registration deadline for each district may be slightly shorter. Now, for the convenience of the business community, the first batch of registrations has been extended to the 20th of this month, but the deadline for the completion of all registrations may also be extended to more than one year. At present, to facilitate matters, some guilds have been allowed to list shop names in accordance with the district method, collect registration forms in batches, and distribute them on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Committee Elected: Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Xuefan, etc.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Since the restoration, prices have fluctuated greatly, and enemy and puppet factories have not been able to fully resume work. The number of unemployed workers is very large, resulting in labor unrest, which has not been completely eliminated. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the City Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union to each nominate 24 arbitration committee members in accordance with Article 16 of the Labor Disputes Handling Law, so that if mediation is ineffective, the municipal government can be requested to convene a meeting to arbitrate. The Chamber of Commerce is said to have nominated Wang Xiaolai and 24 others, and the General Labor Union has nominated Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and 24 others.</p>
<h3>Mobil and Other Companies Continue to Supply: Gasoline, Diesel, and Machine Oil</h3>
<p>Second Batch of Kerosene Flat Sale to Begin Next Week</p>
<p>Since Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco Oil Company began selling civilian kerosene at a low price, the sales of foreign candles in the market have disappeared. After the first batch of these companies has been sold out, the second batch has been scheduled to continue next week, stipulating 2 kilograms per person, 100 yuan per kilogram in legal tender. In addition, the gasoline of the three companies has also been sold, with each gallon temporarily set at 400 yuan in legal tender. There are also a considerable number of diesel and machine oil arrivals, which will soon be launched for sale. All factories for proper use can register first. The price of light diesel is said to be 86,000 yuan per ton, heavy diesel is 70,000 yuan per ton, large buckets of machine oil are 1,800 yuan per gallon, and small cans are 2,000 yuan per gallon. Therefore, the current fuel panic can be partially resolved. [Dagong News Agency]</p>
<p>Shanghai Cost of Living Index for November</p>
<p>There are two cost of living indexes in Shanghai, one compiled by the former National Regulations Committee and the other compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. After the Incident, the former has long been suspended. The latter has been able to continue with the efforts of the chief editor. However, due to the rampant rise in prices, the former Public Works Bureau and the enemy and puppet period did not allow publication to avoid stimulating people's minds. Now, because the government is about to publish on schedule, and the Wage Assessment Committee has also used this index as a powerful basis for assessment, the Chinese worker and staff indexes for November are published below. The Western part is omitted, but the total index is recorded as 96,613.99, which is 17.1% higher than October and 965 times higher than the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. (Base period: 100 in the 25th year of the Republic (calculated in legal tender)).</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Education Restoration Plan: War-Time Overseas Chinese School Losses to Be Compensated by the Japanese; Emphasis on Future Teacher Selection, Training, and Development</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch] The Ministry of Education's post-war restoration work for overseas Chinese education has formulated a plan. The losses suffered by all schools in enemy-occupied areas are being separately investigated and registered. These losses will be compensated by the enemy. The plan particularly emphasizes the selection, training, and development of teachers for overseas Chinese schools in Southeast Asia in the future. Currently, the registration of teachers in overseas Chinese schools in various parts of Southeast Asia is being carried out step by step to facilitate further examination and short-term training. In addition, a special training class for overseas Chinese education teachers will be established at the National Teachers College, as well as an overseas Chinese normal school. A training class for Party ideology teachers for overseas Chinese schools will be established at the Central Political School, selecting domestic university graduates to undergo six months of training to serve as Party or history and geography teachers in overseas Chinese schools in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>University of Nanking to Relocate to Nanjing Next May</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu Dispatch] University of Nanking, one of the thirteen Chinese Christian universities, has a glorious history of fifty-seven years. During the Anti-Japanese War, faculty, staff, library, and equipment were completely relocated to the rear. The current campus is located at Huaxi Dam in Chengdu, and some facilities have been expanded. Over the past two years and recently, the Joint Board of Trustees of Chinese Christian Universities and the Christian Higher Education Association have held multiple meetings in New York, Chongqing, and Chengdu to plan for the post-war development of each university. It has recently been decided that the four universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou will be merged into one school, making a total of ten schools, with University of Nanking given priority status. University of Nanking and Yenching University are designated to run graduate schools, with University of Nanking also running and expanding the electro-optical education department. To expedite the return to Nanjing, the school has shortened the current semester, which will end on January 4th next year. Immediately after the end, the spring semester will begin, preparing for the relocation to Nanjing in early May. (Yuan)</p>
<h3>American University Student Enrollment Soars This Year</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 14th Dispatch] The U.S. Department of Education announced this week that university enrollment this fall has increased by approximately 25% compared to last year. According to statistics obtained after the department surveyed 1,700 schools, this year's enrollment is approximately 950,000 students. Last year's enrollment was approximately 750,000 students. The pre-war enrollment in 1939-1940 was 1.4 million students (that year had one of the highest pre-war enrollments).</p>
<h3>Hunan University Establishes Surrender Hall; Victory Arch Erected in Front of Science Building</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changsha, 15th Dispatch] Hu Shuhua, President of National Hunan University, has renamed the school's science building, where General Wang Yaowu accepted the Japanese surrender for the Changheng region, as Surrender Hall, displaying various souvenirs and war trophies from the surrender ceremony. A Victory Arch has also been erected in front of the building as a memorial.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Alumni Association held a Christmas social gathering last night at the Kangle Restaurant, elected next term's officers, and launched a fundraising campaign for a 50 million yuan school restoration fund.</p>
<p>The Xiang Yao Elementary and Middle School in this city has been reorganized this semester, with Zhou Fei becoming the chairman responsible for the school. Shao Rugan, Chai Zifei, and others have been appointed as school directors, and Tang Jingxiu as the principal. However, Principal Tang recently resigned, and Gu Xudong has been appointed as acting head.</p>
<p>According to Chongqing news, the student union and alumni association of the National Women's Normal College held a reception for women's circles in Chongqing at the Social Hall to report on the school's situation and the progress of the petition to the Ministry of Education regarding the school's relocation, unanimously supporting the school's relocation to the capital.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of a president at St. John's University in this city, a committee temporarily formed by professors Wu Qingtai, Tang Zhongmo, and Wei Xiben is responsible. Bu Fangji, the former president of the school, sent a telegram from Chongqing, inviting the staff and students to Shanghai around February of next year. Upon hearing this, the teachers and students were very excited.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Education Bureau has recently agreed to allocate the school building of the former Fifth National School of Japan, located at the intersection of Qimei Road and Sida Road in Hongkou District, as the school building for Zhongzheng Middle School.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau has decided to establish a municipal normal school for kindergarten teachers at 404 Yuyuan Road. Chen Heqin, the director of the Supervision Department, will temporarily serve as the principal. It is currently scheduled to recruit 150 new students on the 20th, and applicants must have a junior high school diploma. At the same time, 300 elementary school students and 100 kindergarten students will also be recruited.</p>
<h3>An Interview with Mr. Li Denghui</h3>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, amid the cries for restoration, universities and colleges that had moved west have been discussing their return to their original locations. According to news that a committee has been established in Shanghai for the restoration of National Fudan University, our reporter specially interviewed Mr. Li Denghui, the former president of Fudan University, at his private residence in Ruisun Village on Avenue Joffre. He provided detailed information as follows:</p>
<p>During the enemy's occupation, the Fudan University Preparatory Department in Shanghai adhered to three principles: (1) not to compromise with the enemy; (2) not to accept subsidies from the enemy; and (3) to close down if unable to maintain operations. Keeping in communication with President Zhang in Chongqing, they pursued the same path through different means, finally reaching today's bright road.</p>
<p>Original School Buildings</p>
<p>The original Jiangwan campus buildings, such as the dormitories for male and female students and the gymnasium, have been completely destroyed. The remaining damaged parts have been repaired by the puppet Shanghai University during its occupation and can still be used. The Fudan University Preparatory Department moved the Department of Civil Engineering and the Department of Chemistry back to the Jiangwan campus at the beginning of last month to hold classes. A large barracks built by the Japanese invaders on the western side of the campus, which could accommodate thousands of people, is currently being used by the National Army. Once they withdraw, it can be reclaimed for our own use.</p>
<p>Date of Return</p>
<p>The return of the entire main campus from Beibei, Chongqing, is expected to take place during the sweet-scented osmanthus season next year. President Zhang flew from Chongqing to Shanghai last month to discuss the restoration of the school, established a restoration committee, and actively proceeded with various tasks. He also inspected the new campus site in Wuxi with the educational authorities.</p>
<p>New Site in Wuxi</p>
<p>The planning for it started long before the war. The Wuxi campus is located next to Taihu Lake, with an area of 1,014 mu, which is twice the size of the Beibei and Jiangwan campuses combined. It is only a 40-minute journey from the city, offering tranquility in a bustling area. The 36,000 hectares of Taihu Lake, with its scenic beauty, provide ample opportunities for cultivating character and broadening horizons. This is the best environment. In this environment, there are few who cannot be made into talents. As the saying goes, "The land is fertile, and the people are outstanding." However, it is still an empty space, and completion is still pending.</p>
<p>Merger of Chongqing and Shanghai Campuses</p>
<p>Currently, the Fudan University Preparatory Department in Shanghai is divided into four colleges, with a total of more than 1,400 students. The main campus in Chongqing is divided into five colleges, with a total of more than 2,500 students. After the complete relocation next year, it will be merged with the Shanghai campus. The freshmen will first attend classes in Wuxi. Before the school buildings are completed, temples and ancestral halls nearby will be temporarily borrowed.</p>
<p>Rescheduling of the Anniversary</p>
<p>Fudan University has been established for 40 years. This year, it was preparing to hold the 40th anniversary celebration. Due to the distance between Shanghai and Chongqing, the celebration has been postponed to next year and will be held at the same time. At that time, I (Li Denghui) will retire, and President Zhang will take over the overall responsibility for the school's affairs, he said.</p>
<p>The reporter was deeply impressed by this 73-year-old educator, with his white hair and kind smile, speaking eloquently without any sign of fatigue. I respectfully record this to enrich our publication. (Jin Yuan)</p>
<h3>Year 35 Designated as Physical Education Year</h3>

Director Yu Xiu of the City Education Bureau delivered a welcome speech, mentioning that Chairman Zeng had expressed that the 7th National Games will be held the year after next, and preparations can be made in Shanghai next year. He also stated that next year will be designated as Physical Education Year.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Charity Basketball Game Opens Last Night to Unprecedented Success; China United and China Youth Secure Victories; China United vs. O'Sinas Tonight</h3>
<p>The Sino-American charity basketball game, co-sponsored by our newspaper and Tongde College to raise scholarship funds, opened last night at the old Jai Alai Stadium. China United and China Youth secured victories, and the scene along Avenue Edward VII was unprecedented. Enthusiastic basketball fans eager to support education scrambled to attend. Two exciting games will continue tonight at 7:30 PM. Here is a report on last night's games:</p>
<p>Pan Opens the Game</p>
<p>The game began at 7:30 PM, with China United facing the American Marine Corps. Mr. Pan Gongzhan personally performed the opening tip-off. After Mr. Pan tossed the ball, the battle began. China United started with its ideal five players. The American Marine Corps' skills were slightly inferior, and China United took the lead, eventually gaining an absolute advantage with a score of 23 to 6. The American Marine Corps was at a loss. China United then replaced all players with fresh troops. In the first half, China United still led with 27 to 16. In the second half, the American Marine Corps once narrowed the gap to 33 to 27, but China United was not a weak team after all, and ultimately won 46 to 34, with China United easily defeating the American Marine Corps.</p>
<p>One-Point Victory</p>
<p>In the second game, China Youth was originally scheduled to face the American Sea Bees, but the latter was unable to attend due to circumstances. Instead, the American Marine Corps fought in their place, with Mr. Hao Gengsheng performing the opening tip-off. Relying on their height advantage, the American Marine Corps, China Youth worked hard to be cautious, trailing closely behind. At 20 to 17, China Youth suddenly saw an opportunity. Chen Qingjiang scored one point with two free throws, initially taking the lead with 21 to 20. In the first half, China Youth managed to win by a narrow margin of one point, 23 to 22. In the second half, China Youth fought more bravely, with the score fluctuating back and forth. The audience cheered and encouraged them non-stop. With the score tied at 36, China Youth was extremely cautious. Zhang Jinxuan's final shot resulted in a victory of one point, 38 to 36.</p>
<p>Tonight's Great Battle</p>
<p>The same two games will be held at the same venue starting at 7:30 PM tonight. Tickets are priced at 400 yuan for general admission and 1,000 yuan and 3,000 yuan for honorary tickets. Mr. Wang Xiaoyu will perform the opening tip-off. The schedule for today has been revised as follows:</p>

<p>O'Sinas vs. China United 8:30 PM</p>
<p>The strength of the Sea Bees is unknown. The battle between O'Sinas and China United is expected to be one of the most exciting scenes. O'Sinas is the champion team in the American military league and has a strong team. China United is no less than the representative of the Chinese team. This game is a battle for the Sino-American championship, and fans will not easily let go of this opportunity. It is expected that there will be an unprecedented spectacle today.</p>
<h3>How to Rectify Private Schools in This City</h3>
<p>— Taking Traditions First</p>
<p>Shanghai is a relatively developed area in China for education. The reason for this development is that in addition to a few municipal schools, there are also a large number of private schools. Their quality can affect the entire educational situation of this city. Now the City Education Bureau is sending personnel to inspect various schools. We take this opportunity to say a few words.</p>
<p>We believe that although the number of schools in Shanghai (in terms of primary and secondary schools) is not small, there are few that are substantial in content and many that are poor. There are certainly many schools that are run for local education, but there are also schools that are run as businesses. Because the government authorities cannot yet provide universal education, private schools should be encouraged. However, there are many bad schools that go beyond what is reasonable. We hope that the education authorities will ruthlessly ban them.</p>
<p>A good school requires three conditions: First, fair and effective administrative staff; second, good teachers; and third, sufficient funding. We now find two types of schools among the private schools in Shanghai:</p>
<p>One type is the school that has fair and effective administrative staff and excellent teachers, but they have the ability and enthusiasm to run the school and suffer from economic pressure, which prevents their school from developing properly. For this type of school, we hope that the education authorities will provide financial assistance. In the education administrative budget, in addition to the funding for municipal schools, add a private school subsidy.</p>
<p>There is another type of school where funding is not a big problem, but there is no good principal or teacher. Because the principal's finances are not transparent, they lower teachers' salaries and reduce the number of class hours for students, making it impossible for good teachers to stay. I heard that in a school in Nanshi, teachers' salaries are only about 40,000 yuan in puppet currency per month. There is also an elementary school with six grades that only uses two teachers, using a "three-grade combined" system, and the salary is only 300,000 yuan in puppet currency. We hope that the education authorities will immediately order such schools to close down!</p>

<h3>Privately Operated Water and Electricity Plants Returned Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company was taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it has returned the privately operated water and electricity plants previously occupied by the enemy and puppets to their original owners. The Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi branches have also been completely taken over. There are a total of twelve warehouses, storing a large number of water and electricity materials. It is reported that it will be formally handed over to the Resources Committee soon.</p>
<p>The various water and electricity plants belonging to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company have suffered heavy losses over the past eight years and are currently undergoing vigorous repairs. According to the person in charge of the company, there is a significant shortage of water and electricity materials. They are currently applying for assistance from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Therefore, the entire Zhabei area is currently being supplied with electricity by the British-owned Shanghai Power Company. It is feared that it will take two to three months to fully restore all water and electricity plants. It is reported that the company's application to the financial authorities for a loan of 300 million yuan has not yet received formal approval documents.</p>

During the war, the Women's Auxiliary Corps traveled back and forth between the front and rear, making significant contributions to the war effort. There are currently hundreds of people working in Shanghai. The female soldiers leaving Shanghai to return to the country today are the first batch.</p>

<h3>Former French Concession Police Commissioner Chareyre Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Chareyre, the former police commissioner of the French Concession, has been arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command for engaging in large-scale espionage activities for Germany and Japan during the enemy-puppet era. The suspect used reports from French Concession police personnel to provide the enemy with our military and political intelligence. It is reported that during the "August 13th" Incident, Chareyre reported our military situation to the Japanese side to facilitate the enemy's landing strategy at the time. Before his arrest, the suspect claimed to the arresting personnel that he was of French nationality and therefore not under our jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Local Association Welcomes Envoys Ye and Niu</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the Shanghai Local Association held a reception for Envoys Ye and Niu on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. Over a hundred people attended, including Ye Chucang, Niu Yongjian, Chen Xing, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors. The association's chairman, Du Yuesheng, delivered the following welcome speech:</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng's Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Since Shanghai's restoration, high-ranking central government officials have visited one after another, providing invaluable guidance, which has greatly inspired the citizens. Despite his myriad daily responsibilities, the Chairman cares deeply for the people of Jiangnan. He has specially dispatched two envoys from afar to Shanghai to convey his virtuous intentions, offer comfort, and express his concern, for which we are extremely grateful. The two envoys are highly respected for their age and virtue, and are veterans of the party and the nation. Furthermore, being natives of Jiangsu, they have a profound connection to Shanghai and Jiangnan. Upon their return, they will surely alleviate the Chairman's worries and fulfill the hopes of our people. I, Du Yuesheng, with my limited abilities, represent the citizens in extending our warmest welcome and gratitude. Shanghai fell early, second only to Tianjin and Beijing. The enemy occupied our city as a base for westward and southward expansion. For eight years, they exploited, extracted, ravaged, and oppressed us to the extreme. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai suffered the most and eagerly awaited the dawn. The two envoys are well aware of the past experiences, so there is no need for me to elaborate. After the enemy surrendered, the sun shone again. The citizens, after a long period of anticipation, are eager to alleviate their suffering. This urgency is understandable. However, the surrender was received hastily, and preparations were insufficient. Some measures may not have been entirely appropriate, which is forgivable. But even the wisest can make mistakes. The citizens of the entire city deeply understand the central government's good intentions and the diligence of the authorities.</p>
<p>The Stability of Society: Prerequisites</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the stability of society requires two prerequisites: the stability of livelihood and the maintenance of order. These two aspects are two sides of the same coin, mutually causing and influencing each other. After eight years of long-term resistance, the moral standards of the general public have inevitably declined. At the same time, the standard of living for the vast majority of the people is still below par. If production mechanisms are not halted, people can find employment, transportation is improved, goods can flow freely, and public security is restored everywhere, so that people who have lost their home are no longer displaced, then the hungry will easily find food, and the thirsty will easily find drink. Now that the war has ended and everything awaits restoration, the people only wish to live and work in peace. If this wish can be fulfilled, they will be comforted. Therefore, today's priority is to ensure that workers can find jobs, businesses can operate normally, and scattered soldiers, rogue parties, and bandits are completely eradicated, so that farmers can return to their fields and engage in cultivation. This will stabilize the hearts of the people and restore social order to normal. Although this is not a lofty theory, it is practical. It is undoubtedly necessary to start with stabilizing people's livelihoods. Moreover, local conditions vary. Past measures may not be suitable for today's environment, and improvements and reforms are necessary. However, there is a sense of urgency and priorities in time.</p>
<p>Better to Use the People Than to Tax Them</p>
<p>Rather than taxing the people for unnecessary matters, it is better to use them when necessary. Rather than taking from the people to fund non-urgent affairs, it is better to leave it with the people to preserve a glimmer of hope. Recently, in some areas, as reported in the newspapers, the people have been exhausted and their wealth depleted to provide for social engagements and non-urgent matters, leading to public resentment and demands for "no more deepening of the water and no more heating of the fire." Their pain is unspeakable. Director Qian has diligently worked on restoration, making significant progress compared to the initial period of takeover. Given more time, there will undoubtedly be continuous improvement. Our association is a comprehensive organization of people from all walks of life, including finance, industry, commerce, education, culture, and freelance professions. It was established before August 13th. In ordinary times, it is dedicated to social undertakings, such as rural improvement, children's education, food distribution, and compilation of various statistics. During the war, it was dedicated to the relief of refugees, comforting the troops, and raising funds for various national salvation donations. Most of the charts and publications it compiled were destroyed during the occupation, and a small portion was transferred to the rear, which has not yet been returned. Therefore, we cannot present them today. Post-war reconstruction is a challenging task. Our association has always been dedicated to serving the local area as its mission. In the future, under the leadership of the central government's policies, we will assist the local authorities in this challenging task and contribute all our strength to achieve the mission. We ask the two envoys to provide us with more guidance.</p>
<p>Ye Chucang Said, "Take the Good and Discard the Bad"</p>
<p>Ye Chucang then delivered a speech, briefly stating: "This is the local association led by Mr. Du. It is a good opportunity to listen to the opinions of local leaders. The central government is a central government composed of all the local areas of the country, and the central government is the central government of all the people. Therefore, the central government attaches great importance to the opinions of the people. Many of you are leaders in the business world. The business world is extremely important for national construction. I hope you will tell us the true situation in all aspects, and I will certainly report it to the central government. I believe Chairman Chiang will highly value your opinions. 'What is good must be done, and what is bad must be discarded.' What should be done and what should be reformed will surely be handled quickly." Niu Yongjian then gave a speech, elaborating on the central government's emphasis on civil rights and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Bright Prospects for Maritime and Land Transportation</p>
<p>Du then invited Liu Hongsheng to report on Shanghai's transportation and economic situation. He briefly stated: "Eighteen American ocean liners and eight Liberty ships will soon arrive at the port. There is a glimmer of hope for the future of shipping. For land transportation, we have learned that twenty locomotive heads and 3,740 tons of train materials are coming to Shanghai. The prospects for land transportation are also optimistic. Regarding economic recovery, we should first try to restore the pre-war state. When factories reopen and the unemployment problem is solved, the market will gradually prosper, and the people's livelihood problem can also be solved easily. We also hope that the stock exchange will be restored soon, and special attention should be paid to industrial stocks, which will greatly benefit the future of industry." Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank and Special Commissioner for Financial Affairs in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area, expressed two opinions on developing industry: "First, there must be a strong bank dedicated to investing in industry. Second, shareholders should contribute a large amount of capital to supplement the insufficiency of national loans." Cai Zhengya then reported on Shanghai's price and cost of living index. Compared to the pre-war period, the total index for workers increased by 1021 times, for staff by 784 times, and for Westerners by 965 times. Subsequently, Zhang Jianhui, Jin Runxiang, Xue Mingjian, and Xu Yongzuo reported various real situations of people's suffering. The two envoys both stated that they would relay all the situations to the central government.</p>
<h3>Pei Songsun Arrives in Shanghai Amidst Rumors of New Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Pei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday from Chongqing. Mr. Pei is a foreign exchange expert. Several months ago, he accompanied President Song to the United States to discuss China's financial issues with the US Treasury Department. He returned to Chongqing from the United States earlier this month to report to the central authorities on his trip to the United States. When reporters inquired yesterday, Mr. Pei was asked whether the widely rumored foreign exchange rate had been decided and would be announced soon. Mr. Pei told reporters that he had not heard of this rumor. Financial figures in the city claimed yesterday that Mr. Pei would conduct an important review of foreign exchange issues after arriving in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Chen Tingrui Returns from Studying in the United States, Discusses Implementing the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>— Ping Er</p>
<p>"If China wants democracy today, it must first have the rule of law."</p>
<p>This is the view of Councilor Chen Tingrui. Mr. Chen is a famous lawyer in Shanghai. He was invited by the American Legal Academy as a special commissioner of the Judicial Yuan to go to the United States for investigation. He has recently returned to Shanghai. The reporter specifically inquired about the latest judicial administration situation in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen told reporters: "During this trip to the United States, I traveled all over the states and major cities. Under different circumstances, I had contact with American social and political leaders and ordinary people. What impressed me deeply was that the American people's friendship and love for China were completely sincere. They have high hopes for China's future. The Americans I met unanimously hoped that China could unite politically and embark on the path of the rule of law judicially."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen added: "There is currently a great deal of floating capital in the United States. However, if China wants to absorb this floating capital, the domestic political situation must be peaceful so that industry and commerce can develop as much as possible. Secondly, investors must have legal protection. The expectations of all sectors of American society are: (1) China can have modern laws; (2) China can have a sound court system. Regarding modern laws, Mr. Chen told reporters: 'In the past, our country's laws adopted the German and Japanese systems. This continental legal system is undemocratic. British and American laws are based on the people's sovereignty and interests as the basis for legislation, such as the British and American jury system, which not only enables the people to participate in decision-making and judicial administration, but also enables the people to generally gain legal knowledge when participating in the jury. China must follow the evolution of the trend in the future to establish modern laws.'"</p>
<p>When Mr. Chen arrived in the United States, the war against Germany and Japan was entering its final stage. The US government had strict control over prices and the distribution of materials. If a merchant was found to be engaged in black market trading or raising prices, they would be severely punished by law. During the months of investigation in the United States, I never saw government officials using their positions of power to engage in business and make money. Therefore, I believe that the greatest advantage of American law is that the law is for the people. Before the law, everyone, from the President to the common people, stands on an equal footing and is subject to the rule of law.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's conclusion from his trip to the United States is that the foundation of China's prosperity lies in the formulation of a true rule of law, so that our country can generate a sound government, industry, commerce, and society under the spirit of the rule of law. Mr. Chen hopes that the media can call attention to the future of China's rule of law and arouse the attention of all the people.</p>
<p>Chen Tingrui</p>

<h3>Expectations for Today's Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance, the art scene can be said to have undergone a crucible of forging. At the same time, its contributions during the war were significant. Now, with the arrival of victory, we are entering a period of national reconstruction and revival, and it bears an even greater mission. Let us consider: the popularization of education, the improvement of culture, the training of academic skills, the prosperity of industry and commerce, international communication, and even the development of transportation, and continuous exploration—which of these is not an important task of national reconstruction, and which does not require the assistance of art scene workers? Because the mission of the art scene is so important, our expectations for today's art scene are extremely high. As someone who has always enjoyed interacting with the art world, I would like to share some thoughts with you all.</p>
<p>The work of the art scene, expanding from "points" to "surfaces," has already yielded results during this War of Resistance. Now, in the period of reconstruction, we need to expand even further from "surfaces." When the government recovers lost territories, it should "not lose the hearts of the people." This principle of "not losing the hearts of the people" should also be applied to today's art scene. When artists from the rear return to the recovered areas, they must continue the spirit of striving for progress that they have maintained over the years. They also need to quickly remedy the damage that the enemy has inflicted on the art scene. We must use all our energy to build a new art scene. Major commercial ports and provincial capitals are certainly target areas for our work, but we must also open up new art scene work in border regions and remote villages.</p>
<p>In the past, the art scene was a "star system," dominated by a few individuals. I hope that the future art scene can discover more artists with innate talent and specialized skills. The success of artists does not require "hype." We need to educate the administrative authorities to pay attention to the cultivation and training of art scene talent. Only with this talent can the art scene and reconstruction work complement each other.</p>
<p>Today's world is a democratic world, but today's art scene has not yet reached a "democratic" state. The ticket prices of various theaters can prove this; their exorbitant prices make it impossible for us to enter. One way to remedy this is for local administrative authorities to establish public theaters or public art galleries in various places within their means, using the lowest possible prices to instill art in the masses. Another way is to reduce the number of merchants in the art scene. By the end of the five-year post-war economic plan, I hope that every Chinese person will be an appreciator of the Chinese art scene. I hope that every Chinese person can see the theater of the new China on stage, and I hope that every Chinese person can see the development of the new China on the screen.</p>
<h3>Watching Four Plays by Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>— Chen Dezhen</p>
<p>I watched "The Assassin," "Broken Bridge," and "The Strange Twin Meeting," a total of four plays. Unfortunately, I arrived late and "A Stroll in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream" was already nearing its end, which is a real pity. I am now briefly recording my impressions below, which may be of interest to audience members who missed it!</p>
<p>The Assassin—This play was performed at the Lyceum Theatre a month ago and is a masterpiece of Mei's. However, the tiger was played by Cheng Shaoyu, which was somewhat inferior. If it were replaced by Wang Yurang, it would undoubtedly be even more wonderful. This play is divided into six scenes. The earlier scenes involve planning and persuading [the protagonist] to drink, and the final scene is the assassination of the tiger, which is the most intense. Mei's performance is flawless, and her heroic spirit fills her brow. It is a great honor for our country to have such a female hero!</p>
<p>Thinking of Worldly Matters—This is a one-person performance, making it even more demanding, and there are many movements. Mei's performance is beautiful and captivating. Although her voice is broad and bright, her singing is graceful, and her facial expressions are even better. She is neither frivolous nor licentious, and it is a pleasure to watch her. This is what makes Mei so valuable. The state of mind of not being focused on the scriptures while chanting is very subtle. When she walks outside the mountain gate and sees the beauty of nature, her joy is immediately apparent on her face. And when she escapes to the foot of the mountain, because she has gained liberation and freedom, she is even more delighted. In this play, Mei plays the young nun Sekong, whose general idea is that she cannot bear the loneliness and monotony of life in the nunnery, and finally escapes from the temple, advocating liberation and proclaiming freedom. Her consciousness is particularly good!</p>
<p>Broken Bridge—This is a folk tale, a section from the Legend of the White Snake, known to every household. Mei plays the White Maiden, and her cries of "bitterness" are unbearable to hear. Then, she appears with Xiaoqing, wearing a girdle and dressed in plain white, indicating the pain in her abdomen, which cannot help but make people shed tears of sympathy. Xiaoqing rebukes Xu for his faithlessness, glaring at him, while Bai attempts to persuade him in every way, showing extreme love and affection, and lamenting her own misfortune, expressing the deep love between husband and wife, which moves everyone. When she sings the song "Golden Lasso," it is like weeping and complaining, like resentment and longing, making people's hearts ache. Yu Wu, who plays Xu Xian, does an excellent job of acting, especially when he kneels and begs for mercy. Xiaoqing, who delivers the tea, is also not weak, but her face is too scary!</p>
<p>Strange Twin Meeting—This is the Buying Horse Tale, a popular Chuichang Opera in recent years. From the start of the weeping in prison to the reunion of the three, Lanfang's Guizhi is dignified, elegant, steady, and generous, befitting the identity of a lady. When she hears Li Qi's cries, she wants to recognize her father but does not dare to, and her heart is filled with mixed feelings of joy and fear, which is truly moving. Her writing and Zhuang Yi and Zhenfei's singing and answering each other perfectly express the beautiful scenery and tender feelings. The joy of the boudoir is enviable, and the beauty of this scene is unparalleled. The supporting roles are all famous actors, making it even more of a perfect combination!</p>
<h3>Morality in Old Plays</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Here, "old plays" include Kunqu Opera, Gaoqiang Opera, Zouqiang Opera, Yiqiang Opera, Peking Opera, and various local operas. Peking Opera was born relatively late, with only over a hundred years of history, but it has been able to penetrate into the folk and be welcomed by a large number of people, spreading throughout the country. Even a village or town has its traces, so its good or bad performance has a great impact on the society and the people.</p>
<p>Because I study popular education and my temperament is close to drama, I have specialized in studying old plays. Among old plays, Peking Opera is the most popular and has the largest audience, so I have put a lot of effort into it. Now I will only talk about Peking Opera.</p>
<p>Peking Opera can be divided into historical plays, family plays, satirical plays, and miscellaneous plays, of various types. It is a collection of ancient plays and local plays, containing Kunqu Opera, Bangzi Opera, Huizhou Opera, and Han Opera, with various tunes, especially inheriting more elements of Kunqu Opera. Most of the scripts are adapted from Kunqu Opera, especially historical plays.</p>
<p>Since Peking Opera is a descendant of Kunqu Opera, its expressive meaning is the same as Kunqu Opera, actively focusing on maintaining morality, and especially writing about the昏庸荒淫 [morally corrupt and licentious] of the monarchs of fallen countries and the loyalty and treachery of ministers, giving people a cautionary tale and calling on people to be vigilant.</p>
<p>This belongs to historical plays. In family plays, there are also many plays that express benevolence, filial piety, trustworthiness, and righteousness. Examples are readily available and do not need to be listed one by one. In addition, there are satirical plays, such as "Promotion Through Three Grades," which vividly depicts the snobbishness of an innkeeper. There are also miscellaneous plays and mythological plays, which are used to regulate the eyes and time, and are not of great importance. In short, the purpose of old plays is purely to maintain loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and various moralities. They are by no means solely for entertainment. Peking Opera is like this, and other old plays are also like this.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, for more than thirty years, it has gone through the dictatorship of warlords, foreign aggression, social unrest, and the people's livelihood has not been secure. Old morality has declined sharply. In addition, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, there was no time to talk about it, especially for the people in the occupied areas, who were shameless and lost all old morality. Moreover, evil doctrines are rampant, and the danger at this time is very great. We should promote old morality to try to save it. I believe that if we want to preserve morality, we should start with improving old plays, so as to achieve the effect of imperceptible influence and achieve twice the result with half the effort. I think that government leaders and social leaders have already seen this with their far-sighted vision.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Dynamics After the War</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Since wars broke out in Europe and Asia one after another, the overseas market for Hollywood films plummeted, and the film industry suffered an unprecedented blow. The films produced could only be shown in North and South America, and the market has shrunk drastically. When the United States joined the war, the situation changed again. Large companies were guided or controlled by the state to make propaganda war films, while small companies could not support themselves and closed down one after another. Some of the male and female stars were drafted into the army or volunteered for service. The entire film city showed signs of decline.</p>
<p>Now the United States has won, and world peace has been achieved. The film city has naturally become active again. In addition to large companies, which are planning to shoot a large number of films, small companies that have closed down are also eager to return to work and resume their businesses. Some of the male and female stars who went to their posts or the rear have returned to Hollywood, ready to try the life of the silver screen again. Everything is different from the war period. Although a few filmmakers have died or grown old in the past five or six years, most of the world-famous stars are healthy and will soon be able to see us again.</p>
<p>After such a big change, the style of Hollywood film companies will naturally have to change. Because recently, American newspapers and magazines have welcomed writings about the diaries of conscripts, the activities of spies, international conspiracies, and battlefield reports. Therefore, Hollywood film companies will also adopt this type of material for future film scripts. They are currently soliciting from all parties. At the same time, because Americans have always sympathized with China for eight years, and especially admire China's resistance, they also plan to collect stories about China's war of resistance and the real situation on the battlefield, and compile them into scripts for filming. We can foresee that this type of film will be very popular for at least the next year or two.</p>
<h3>This Week's Film and Theater</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper's theater advertisements, they are truly dazzling, like a "brightly dressed" beauty, and it also seems to be a world of "songs and dances of peace." However, when you observe it from another angle with an eye for appreciating art, you will be disappointed, even sad, because there are so few plays that are worth watching and meet the conditions for selection.</p>
<p>One thing that can be mentioned this week is:</p>
<p>Japanese Spy (Film)</p>
<p>This film is produced by the China Film Studio in the wartime capital and is a new film that will be shown at the "Great Light" and "Nanjing" theaters after "A Spirit-Stirring Nation." The scenes are magnificent, ranking among the top international films. The director, Xiao Mei, is not unfamiliar to the people of Shanghai. The leading actress, who plays a Japanese female spy, is Miss Su Jingzi. This is a newcomer from the rear, and few people in Shanghai know her. Here we will see Miss Yu's acting skills. Especially since British and American expatriates are participating in the performance, after the people of Shanghai have seen the puppet film "Regret on the Yan River," they can change their tastes.</p>
<p>Mount Miaofeng (Play)</p>
<p>This is a work by Ding Xilin four years ago. "Mount Miaofeng" takes Wang Laohu, a guerrilla hero from a peasant background, as the protagonist. It uses the revolutionary war during the War of Resistance as the background and writes down the historical facts of real meritorious deeds in the War of Resistance. It will tell us what kind of army can win the support of the people, how can we persist until victory, and how can we win the hearts of the people. Especially since the author handles such serious material with a witty and pungent approach, to this day, we have not seen a comedic touch that surpasses his. This is a true depiction of the War of Resistance. From the perspective of ordinary people like us, we will undoubtedly feel extra close to it.</p>
<p>Youthful Wanderings (Play)</p>
<p>"Youthful Wanderings" has emotion, "Youthful Wanderings" is poetry. "Youthful Wanderings" is a work completed by Wu Zuguang in the rear. But "Youthful Wanderings" is not the group of young people in Mao Dun's "Corrosion." Some people say that this is Wu Zuguang's own youth, which may be possible, because the authenticity of the work is allowed. In short, "Youthful Wanderings" is a play worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Meng Jiangnu (Musical)</p>
<p>This is a play that focuses on music and emphasizes dance and dialogue equally. This is a new attempt in China. The general audience may not be able to appreciate its artistic conception or the beauty of this Chinese classical art, but this attempt has indeed attracted attention from all parties and has led to a review of the future direction of Chinese drama. The Shanghai Broadcasting Station is broadcasting this play to the whole country tonight, which shows the general importance that all parties attach to "Meng Jiangnu."</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's Plays (Kunqu Opera)</p>
<p>The evaluation of Dr. Mei Lanfang has already been settled, and there is no need for me to repeat it. The problem is that Mei Lanfang's loyalty and integrity and his return to the stage today are worth commemorating. Especially his artistic level is worthy of being called a representative of Chinese art. Moreover, Dr. Mei's performance opportunities will probably not be many in the future, so it is indeed worth seeing.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Watching the Games While Helping Students Predicts Even More Enthusiasm Tonight Supporting the Righteous Cause is a Due Duty</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Charity Basketball Game opened last night. Two games were played, and the situation was enthusiastic, unprecedented. The reporter, who participated in the event, cannot help but speak about it. I will pick up a few points to tell the gentlemen who missed it:</p>
<p>Public Order is in Good Order By 7:00 pm, the vicinity of the Chinese Sports Field was crowded with people from all walks of life. There were so many cars and horses that it was impossible to pass. Some people were worried that the order might be disrupted. But the person in charge of the venue was confident. They guided the audience to take their seats in order. Many receptionists and inspectors also assisted from the side. Before long, everyone took their places, and the order was in good order, which shows that the audience's level has reached a standard, which is truly a gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>Players Adhere to Morality Any cause must adhere to morality. Isn't it the same for sports? A basketball game is a strenuous sport. It is easiest to have irregular actions when you are competing with each other and it is difficult to distinguish between them. Moreover, in the international competition between China and the United States, there are differences in bloodlines and customs. Last night, the two sides competed and ran as they pleased, but they always maintained a moral concept and sports discipline. In terms of international friendship, they can be regarded as working together in harmony, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>The Audience's Emotions are Enthusiastic Judging from the enthusiastic emotions of the audience at the opening game last night, tonight will definitely be even more energetic. Because today is a Sunday, and the citizens of Shanghai can take the opportunity to watch two basketball games in the evening, which will refresh their minds and make them even more interested. Moreover, buying tickets helps students and relieves the poor, and cultivating talents for the country is a duty that people should have. So-called killing two birds with one stone, why not do it?</p>
<h3>The Kawamura Memorial Tower Should be Renamed Immediately Please Pay Attention to the Municipal Authorities</h3>
<p>On the 28th of last month, the editor of this column instructed us that there are many unreasonable things in society that the people should urge so that the responsible authorities will be alert. In the democratic era, any political affair should be based on the people, and no one can hinder it. Therefore, I sincerely support the position of your column, and I dare to put forward some small thoughts here. Whenever the 26th road tram passes through the Xiaoshadu Road on the [illegible] road, the most [illegible] is that the "Kawamura Memorial Tower" that the enemy destroyed us is still standing in front of us. After eight years of bloody battles, my country's international status has been raised, extraterritoriality has been abolished, and concessions in various places have been recovered. Does this "Kawamura Memorial Tower" have any special existence for its poor record of invading our country?</p>
<p>I demand that the bad name of the "Kawamura Memorial Tower" be eliminated immediately, and that it be renamed the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Tower, the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Tower, the Lone Army Memorial Tower, or the Unknown Heroes Memorial Tower...etc., as well as great figures or the facts of great historical achievements that the people truly support, to enhance and enlighten the national ideology of the citizens. I raise this issue and ask the municipal authorities to consider it.</p>
