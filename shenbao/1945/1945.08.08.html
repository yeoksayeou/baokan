<p>昭南七日中央社電　日南方軍基於客歲九月七日向中外闡明之日本帝國許可東印度民族獨立公約，爲謀其早日實現獨立，邇來實施特別任用原住民充任官吏，或許可使用民族歌，或展開新國民運動等諸施策，對東印度民族施以政治訓練，一方設置獨立準備調查會，關於獨立國家之基本性格，進行諸般準備，　極指導民衆邁向獨立之途。復爲促進其建立獨立政府，頃同意於八月中旬設置東印度獨立準備委員會，日南方軍於七日正午已正式發表。</p>
<p>爪加爾達七日中央社電　蘇門答臘日軍最高指揮官關於東印度成立獨立準備委員會一項，七日發表聲明，大旨如次：日本基於旣定方針，以八月中旬爲期，於爪哇設立東印度獨立準備委員會，一俟準備就緒，當即宣吿獨立。此準備委員會乃準備獨立之最後階段，而設委員會之使命，乃在依據正義，於敵前建設高度國防國家，以應住民之深切期待，以酬大東亞各國家各民族之厚誼。</p>

<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營於七日下午三時半發表：　昨六日廣島市因受敵機B29型小編隊之攻擊，發生相當損害。　敵機於此次攻擊中，似使用新式炸彈，詳細情形該正調查中。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　本月六日來展廣島市之B29型小編隊，曾對市街地帶投下新式炸彈，致市內房屋倒壞極多，又市內各處發生火災，蒙受相當損害。查此次新式炸彈，附有降落傘，着地以前，於空中炸裝，關於該彈之戚力，刻加以調查中，但不容輕視耳。敵現擬使用此新式炸彈，以殺傷無辜日民衆，自向世界暴露美國人之殘忍性。敵方所以揭去人道主義之假而具，開始使用殘虐之新兵器，要爲焦慮戰局之現狀，預料此後將繼續使用此種炸彈，但日當局關於此項對策，以確固之自信而研究中。新兵器之威力，於出現初期誠收相當效果，但一經覓得對抗方法，則其威力必可喪失矣。</p>

<p>東京七日中央社電　敵機P51型約四十架，由B29型一架前導，七日上午十時二十分來　關東地區，主要於京濱西南方天空活動，對日方軍事設施及市街地區加以機槍掃射。又此次來襲敵機，曾有英國空軍參加（機型不祥），此點頗値注目。</p>

<p>名古屋七日中央社電　七日上午零時三十分許，敵大型戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊約百架，由志麾半島沿岸附近侵入，於豐川附近施以炸彈攻擊後退去，致豐川市苦干處發生火災，但未幾即被撲滅。</p>
<p>殘酷行動天人共憤</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　美自六月十七日以來，屢於夜問盲目轟炸日本各中小都市，暴露其毀滅具有三千年光輝歷史之日本民族之野心。敵空軍轟炸京濱地區大阪·神戶·名古屋等地後，自七月以來，復以殺傷爲目標，開始轟炸燒毀日本之中小都市，一面高唱基督敎之人道主義，一面於其行爲上，充分發揮其殘暴無人道之劣根性。例如P51型與P29型機於攻擊日本土各地軍事設施時，曾對非戰鬥人員之市民，與無辜老幼婦孺加以轟炸，或以機槍掃射，期使日本之中小都市毀爲焦土。犧牲於敵人暴虐下之大部份小都市，均爲全不設防之都市，旣無軍事施設，亦未有軍需工塲，敵機於施行轟炸時，必先於市民避難所之近郊。山林空地等投下燒夷彈，將　民包圍於市區之內，然後開始以燒夷彈集中攻擊，因之市民死傷極衆，此例數見不鮮，而其結果，亦自以婦孺之死傷率最高。例如千葉縣之戰災，死亡者九百五十四名，內有男子四百三十名，女子五百二十四名，女子占其中之五成四，又其中十二歲以下之幼童計二百三十四名，（內男孩百十八名，女孩百十六名）聯災死亡者總數中，幼童占其中二成四强。又就物量損害言之，敵方亦極表示其違反人道與破壞文化之野蠻行爲，例如六月二十九日敵機空襲岡山市時，曾破壞燒毀神社二十三，佛閣四十四，醫院九十三，學校三十一處，及其他著名史蹟多處。敵對神社佛閣之轟炸計　，自攻擊皇大神宮·外宮·及明治神宮以來，已極爲昭彰，此種美軍暴虐行爲，實天人共不容，徒引起日本全國國民之憤激而已。</p>

<p>日昨本市各報均載陳代主席在中央　大紀念週訓詞：「國民黨的再檢討」，我們雖未及窺其全豹，但就第一章「國民黨與憲政」一部分，已使我們發生很多感想，爰申述如次：</p>
<p>關於國民黨，陳代主席以先進聲望而作再檢討，其所見所感，自非一般人浮職之論所可比擬，我們以完全處於黨外人民的立塲，對於久未獲讀的這種公允的檢討，殊感欣幸。國民黨從同盟會而發展爲今日全國唯一大黨的地位，自非偶然；孫中山先生的學說及三民主義之深入人心，國民黨在五十年來對國家與革命的貢獻，以及國民黨先烈爲革命建國而先仆後縱的史蹟，永遠銘刻在全國人民的心底，也是誰都不能否認的。不過，國民黨的發展，是曲綫式的，其間曾經再三再四的陷於消沉，而形成分崩離析的局面，幾次使全國人民望望然而去之，即黨內有志人士，亦往往有如公博先生那樣「蜇居觀變」的苦悶。這也是無可否認的事實。</p>
<p>不過無論如何，以擁有五十年光榮歷史的國民黨，其主義與實力已深入民間，決不能以暫時的不良現象而悲觀失望，更不能因敵黨的勢力膨脹而自存怯懦之心理，發爲偏狹排他之表示，而陷進牛角尖裘，這也是渦去國民黨內許多賢明的領袖一致的覺悟，且曾不斷以此警惕其同志，以對外包容寬大對內自强不息爲基本態度。可惜的是迎年時局不寗，一方而黨內在地域上有分裂之實，另方而在黨外受民間的冷淡。這種現象，與其說是國民黨的不幸，再寗說是中國的不幸。我們深盼國民黨能在最高領袖公正的自我檢討之下，在不久的將來，去舊更新，團結自强，更主要的是要能和民衆接近，和民衆在一起奮鬬，能相信民衆，以獲取民衆的擁護，然後才有可能集中全國力量，共同完成革命建國的大業。</p>
<p>我們在這前提之下，深覺公博先生關於國民黨與憲政的正確立論，實爲當前向革命建國邁進的勝利之路。公博先生說：「人民爲什麼要實施憲政？自然是一稱反對一黨專制而要求還政於民的表示，這一點，我實在是同情而且願意盡我的力量促成的。」公博先生並且堅決地指出：「民國成立至今，已三十四年，始終沒有一部上下相守的憲法，這是一種笑話，也是一種恥辱……我不但同情憲政的實施和民意機關的設立，而且我更願促成實施和設立的期日」，公傳先生是今日和平區黨政最高領袖，這種堅決明確和熟誠的態度，相信一定能爲全國各方面所欽佩的。</p>
<p>我們除了慶幸和平區黨政最高當局這種賢朋的表示之外，淺見所及，尚有三點希望，特別乘此提出來向公博先生和各方有道請敎：</p>
<p>第一，全國民衆雖然認爲一黨專制爲革命建國成功途上的一大阻礙，但是我們並不認爲和平區現行政治是一黨專制。因此，我們當前的任務，不在消極的反抗一黨專制，而是積極的促成憲政民治和法治。我們認爲，今日大家要不分黨派不分界域，努力於促成憲政的實施，是積極的建設性的協力，而不是消極的分裂的鬥爭。</p>
<p>第二，就現階段說，我們中國無分官民，共同的任務，是對外擺脫帝國主義侵略與滅亡我民族的危機，團結東亞各國一致奮鬥，因此對內必須集中全國國力，只是在這一目的之下，我們需要有一個爲大多數民衆所相信與擁護的强力政府，這個政府必須講求政治革新，使政治漸趨淸明，同時，這一們政府，必須和民衆站在一起。爲了實現這個迫急的要求，我們最低限度的目標，還不是理想的「立即實施憲政」，而是儘速成立眞正的民意機關，使政府和民衆親密地團結一體，以應付內外時局的迫切需要。</p>
<p>第三，民意機關的設立和健全的執行其任務，使人民和政府團結在一起，而致力於完成反對帝國主義的大東亞戰爭之後，建國復興的大業，即將展開在我們面前，那是我們提出最大限度目標，即實現憲政的時候了。不過，憲政決不是一蹴可舉的事業，到那時萬行籌備，便不免過於匆促。所以，我們在民意機關成立之後，一方面要發揮其爲政府與民衆間之橋樑的作用，另方面就得對於實施憲政的準備工作，積極推進，以期戰爭一結束，立刻可能召開眞正的國民大會，討論及制定憲法，進而建立民主共和的政府。</p>
<h3 id="c11">國民黨的再檢討（二） <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>國民黨本質的批評</p>
<p>我們今日若以旁觀者的地位，拿冷靜頭腦去觀察，國民黨實在不過是一個普通政黨，有時連普通政黨亦不如。國爲普通政黨在競選的時候，還有競選向民衆宣傳黨綱和政綱，來博取人民同意，求得勝利。至於國民黨除了開會恭讀總理遺囑以外，那一個人會向民衆宣傳建國方略，建國大綱，三民主義，不僅他們不會向民衆宣傳，連自己也在那裏作爲聖諭廣訓誦唸，口雖朗讀而心不知所之，無怪國民黨每年都大呼有四十萬的黨員，每年如此不增不減。</p>
<p>國民黨不是創建了中華民國的名義就算的，也不是求得全國統一的名義就算的，吾們最大的目的，就在於平均地權和節制資本。據我研究，平均地權祇是一種方式，其精神在於反對封建；節制資本亦祇是一種方式，其精神在於反資本主義。前者的目的在於要踏上現代國家的途逕，後者的目的在於防制社會革命的發生，能夠明白這種目的，才算是國民黨的黨員，能够實行這目的，才可算是健全的國民黨。</p>
<p>國民黨的主張本是反封建的，但最近變了封建的集團了。我還記得在十八年時候，自稱所謂改組派的，曾經反對過三全代表大會指定制。平心而論，當日我們堅特選舉代表，並沒有絲毫心事要替改組派奪政權，沒有絲毫心事反對南京政府，也沒有絲毫心事要破壞本黨的統一。相反的，實在是關心黨的未來命運，和國家前途。大會代表由中央指派，省黨部委員，由組織部指派，而各縣市黨部也由省委員指派，如此黨部便與黨員分離了，黨部更與民衆分離了，黨員沒有被選權，也沒有選舉權，他對黨還有什麼關係？然的機構不是由黨員意志成立的，他對黨還有什麼興趣？而且因爲指派，不得不尊重地方長官的意見，更不得不酌派地方長官的私人，本來黨是要來監督有黨籍的官吏的，而結果成了黨內官吏的附屬和裝飾品，黨成了無數私人的系統，自然成了封建集團，黨成了封建，什麼民主集權的理想，俱成空論，黨不民主，何由集權，權旣成系，無從民主，這是國民黨一個最大的致命傷。</p>
<p>國民黨本來是反資本主義的，然而自十八年以來，執大政的人們成了資本家，黨旣沒有力量去制裁，甚至沒有勇氣去批評一個握有政勢的黨員，而堂握最高權的個人又顧慮太多，耳目不廣，自然黨員便憑藉地位蓄私自利。自從國民黨當權以後，除了製造成許多資本家及附屬於大官的小資木家外，國民黨對於國家的重獻，實在太少，一般人民沒有方法分別國民黨有異於其他政然，更沒有方法分別國民軍閥和官僚，反資本主義固然談不到，就是民族資本，也並非這班官僚資本者所能形成，這不是國民黨的致命傷嗎？</p>
<p>老實說，國民黨今日名義上猶能當政，幷不是靠黨的政綱，也不是靠黨的力量，所靠的還是民衆還在思念國民黨先烈以往建國功勛，以及國步艱難，暫時找不出取國民黨而代的黨派，所以對國民黨祇好加以最後的期望，這不是理智而是情感，甚或是一種環境所迫，這種留戀，是有限度的，幷且是有時期的，我們若不從速改革，國民黨必終於沒落。</p>
<p>國民黨組織的透禮</p>
<p>國民黨今日亟應恢復原有的目的和精神，是毫無疑義了。至於組織我也願意坦白的批評，我所謂組織是包含組織，訓練，策略三種事實。</p>
<p>第一組織，我一向主張黨要秘密的，我有兩個理由：其一，國民黨是革命黨，革命黨的性質是鬥爭的，中國照大體看來，革命黨沒有成功，幷且離成功太遠，也需要鬥爭的。軍事上鬥爭若求勝利，在於知已知彼，方可百戰百勝，軍事鬥爭如此，政治鬥爭也復如此。黨一公開，未能知彼，而先被人知，那麼便無從鬥爭起，何况目前要顚覆民國者有人，要推翻政府者有人，要消減國民黨者也有人，這樣，一般黨員，還不理解黨的秘密，我實在不知何故。其二，黨的鬥爭，有一句名言「秘密就是力量」，黨的公開，無論是否失了力量，至少黨員以爲成功減少他的奮鬥意趣，現在許多黨還爭着黨要公開，以爲不公開，工作便無從做起，他們也有自己的理由。例如社會運動罷，以爲民衆團體受了黨的支配，登記要黨的允許，行動要黨的指導，何等方便。但我們要知道，如果民衆團體是自動和願意的，那還沒有事麼，倘使格於規章，勉强遵守的，先使民衆留下一個對黨極惡的印象，而且，一個民衆團體裹面有我們强有力的黨團，那麼受黨支配與否，無關宏旨，若裹面不能發生黨團作用，就使表面受黨支配，有何用處？自然也有黨員會說黨管轄民衆是有辦法，政府是沒有辦法的，可是我們忘記了一件重要的事實，那掌握政府的多數是黨員，是不是一個黨員在黨部服務對民衆可以有辦法，而黨員一到了政府服務就沒有辦法。倘若不是的，那種理論，便不成理由，倘若是的，那就是國民黨本身的嚴重問題，而不是黨公開與不公開與夫黨支配不支配民衆團體了。還有黨要公開才有辦法的話，那麼同盟會當時之不公開的，並且萬不能公開的，照此推論，中國也不會發生革命，中華民國不會有建立了。（未完待續）</p>

<p>中央社訊　重慶四日廣播國共分爭情形如次：延安軍於淳化及爺台山一帶，業已抵抗一週之久，六月廿八日遇渝軍之猛烈砲擊，遂向後方撤退，渝軍業民接收該地，停止前進。雙方各有軍對三師互相對峙，今後似將以政治交涉謀取解決之傾向。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　朝日新聞六日之社論，以「國共內戰之限度」爲題，論述如次：</p>
<p>據最近報道，頻傳國共軍武力衝突事件，中共方面目標堅持利用蘇聯爲背景，與國民黨軍鬥爭，以建立統一戰線政權，惟重慶擁有較中共強盛之武力，故中共努力避免與重慶軍發生武力抗爭，惟祇須預計絕無擴大至全面抗戰之危懼。則有時亦冒最大危險，以謀在政治上獲得效果，此次中共於不願犧牲之下，不得不放棄攻擊，其內心固極悲痛也。此次武力衝突，恐非因重慶軍挑撥而起，中共旣握有主動權，武力衝突僅屬局部的。偶發的。以及末梢的，但未始絕無擴大至全面武力衝突之可能性。彼等抗日作戰以獨立自主爲標榜，然一方面倒行逆施，此眞林語堂所謂「淚與笑之間」的悲劇，悲劇中含有喜劇之成份，在抗是之中國，此種矛盾亦一塲悲喜劇也。國共在今日均已喪失解決問題之自主性，兩者各聽從幕後人之牽動，因此在抗日中國之內部，惟此種末梢的衝突，猶不能牽制幕後人之意向，內戰之繼續勃發，決不能使和解之折衝因此受挫，一般觀測此種武力衝突，將引起雙方全面的武力抗爭，亦不能全信。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan, Based on Established Policy, Supports East Indies Independence; Establishes Preparatory Committee for Independence in Java <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shonan, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Based on the Japanese Empire's public declaration to China and foreign countries on September 7th of last year, permitting the independence of the East Indies people, the Japanese Southern Army has been implementing various measures to achieve independence as soon as possible. This includes specially appointing indigenous people to official positions, permitting the use of ethnic songs, and launching new national movements to provide political training to the East Indies people. Furthermore, an independent preparatory investigation committee has been established to conduct various preparations regarding the fundamental characteristics of an independent nation, guiding the people towards independence. In order to promote the establishment of an independent government, it has now been agreed to establish an East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee in mid-August, which was officially announced by the Japanese Southern Army at noon on the 7th.</p>
<p>Jakarta, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Regarding the establishment of the East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Sumatra issued a statement on the 7th, the gist of which is as follows: Based on its established policy, Japan will establish the East Indies Independence Preparatory Committee in Java by mid-August. As soon as preparations are complete, independence will be declared immediately. This Preparatory Committee is the final stage of preparing for independence, and the mission of the committee is to build a nation with a high degree of national defense in the face of the enemy, based on justice, in order to meet the deep expectations of the residents and to repay the kindness of the various nations and peoples of the Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e2">B-29 Formation Raids Hiroshima City, Uses New Type of Bomb, Killing and Wounding Innocents <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 7th that Hiroshima City suffered considerable damage due to an attack by a small formation of enemy B-29 aircraft yesterday, the 6th. The enemy aircraft appeared to have used a new type of bomb in this attack, and detailed information is currently being investigated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The small formation of B-29 aircraft that appeared over Hiroshima City on the 6th dropped a new type of bomb on the urban area, causing many houses to collapse and numerous fires to break out, resulting in considerable damage. It has been found that this new type of bomb is equipped with a parachute and detonates in the air before landing. The power of the bomb is currently being investigated, but it should not be underestimated. The enemy intends to use this new type of bomb to kill innocent Japanese civilians, thus exposing the cruelty of the Americans to the world. The enemy's willingness to discard the facade of humanitarianism and start using cruel new weapons is due to anxiety about the current state of the war. It is anticipated that this type of bomb will continue to be used in the future, but the Japanese authorities are researching countermeasures with firm confidence. The power of new weapons is undoubtedly quite effective in the initial stages, but once a countermeasure is found, its power can certainly be lost.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Keihin Area Suffers Another Air Raid; British Air Force Participates <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately forty enemy P-51 aircraft, led by one B-29 aircraft, came to the Kanto area at 10:20 AM on the 7th, mainly operating in the southwestern sky of Keihin, and machine-gunned Japanese military facilities and urban areas. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the enemy aircraft that attacked this time included the participation of the British Air Force (type of aircraft unknown).</p>
<p>One Hundred Enemy Aircraft Blindly Bomb Toyokawa</p>
<p>Nagoya, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At approximately 0:30 AM on the 7th, a combined formation of approximately one hundred enemy large fighter-bombers invaded from near the coast of the Shima Peninsula and retreated after attacking the vicinity of Toyokawa with bombs, causing fires to break out in several places in Toyokawa City, but they were quickly extinguished.</p>
<p>Cruel Acts Arouse the Anger of Gods and Men</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since June 17th, the United States has repeatedly conducted indiscriminate bombing of various small and medium-sized cities in Japan at night, exposing its ambition to destroy the Japanese nation, which has a glorious history of three thousand years. After bombing the Keihin area, Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, etc., the enemy air force, since July, has begun bombing and burning Japanese small and medium-sized cities with the aim of killing civilians. While chanting the humanitarianism of Christianity, they fully demonstrate their brutal and inhumane inferiority in their actions. For example, when P-51 and P-29 aircraft attacked military facilities in various parts of Japan, they bombed civilians, including non-combatant citizens, innocent elderly, young children, and women, or machine-gunned them, with the aim of turning Japanese small and medium-sized cities into scorched earth. The majority of the small cities that have been sacrificed to the enemy's tyranny are undefended cities, with no military facilities or munitions factories. When carrying out bombing raids, enemy aircraft first drop incendiary bombs near the suburbs of civilian shelters, forests, and open spaces, surrounding the civilians in the urban areas before starting a concentrated attack with incendiary bombs, resulting in a large number of civilian casualties, which is a common occurrence, and as a result, the casualty rate among women and children is the highest. For example, in the war disaster in Chiba Prefecture, out of 954 deaths, 430 were men and 524 were women, with women accounting for 54% of the total. Furthermore, there were 234 children under the age of twelve (118 boys and 116 girls), with children accounting for more than 24% of the total number of deaths. In terms of material damage, the enemy also extremely demonstrates its inhuman and culturally destructive barbarism. For example, during the enemy air raid on Okayama City on June 29th, they destroyed and burned 23 shrines, 44 Buddhist temples, 93 hospitals, 31 schools, and many other famous historical sites. The enemy's bombing of shrines and Buddhist temples has been extremely blatant since the attacks on the Ise Grand Shrine, Outer Shrine, and Meiji Shrine. These tyrannical acts of the American military are truly intolerable to both gods and men and only arouse the indignation of the entire Japanese nation.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Lieutenant General Hui Enzheng, Director-General of the Special Transport Vessel Management Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago and met with Acting Chairman Chen to report on his work. On the 7th, he also gave a statement to visiting reporters as follows: In view of the importance of transportation under the wartime system, the National Government's Standing Committee specially established the Special Transport Vessel Management Bureau in Shanghai, and established branch bureaus in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Haizhou, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Tanggu and other regions, in order to facilitate the smooth exchange of military supplies in North and Central China, and to handle the registration of civilian ships and assist in civilian shipping affairs. Since the establishment of this Bureau, branch bureaus and offices have also been established one after another in various locations, but there are still people from all walks of life who do not understand the correct mission of this Bureau, and even mistake this Bureau for a tax collection agency, which is a mistake. Recently, the organization of this Bureau and its various branch bureaus will be strengthened in order to promote work.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Kuomintang and Constitutionalism <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the newspapers in this city carried Acting Chairman Chen's address at the Central Party's weekly memorial service: "The Kuomintang's Re-examination." Although we have not been able to see the full picture, the section on "The Kuomintang and Constitutionalism" alone has given us much food for thought. We would like to express our views as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Kuomintang, Acting Chairman Chen, with his advanced reputation, has made a re-examination, and his insights and feelings are certainly beyond the ordinary superficial remarks. From the standpoint of people completely outside the party, we are particularly pleased to read such a fair review, which we have not had the opportunity to do for a long time. The Kuomintang's development from the Tongmenghui to its current position as the only major party in the country is no accident. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the Three Principles of the People have deeply penetrated people's hearts. The Kuomintang's contributions to the country and the revolution over the past fifty years, and the historical deeds of the Kuomintang martyrs who fell one after another for the revolution and nation-building, are forever engraved in the hearts of the people of the whole country, and no one can deny them. However, the Kuomintang's development has been curvilinear. During that time, it repeatedly fell into depression and formed a disintegrated situation, which made the people of the whole country feel hopeless and leave. Even ambitious people within the party often had the depression of "retreating to observe the situation," like Mr. Gongbo. This is also an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>However, in any case, the Kuomintang, with its fifty years of glorious history, has deeply rooted its doctrines and strength in the people. It must not be pessimistic and disappointed by temporary bad phenomena, let alone be timid and fearful of the expansion of enemy parties, express narrow-minded exclusiveness, and fall into a dead end. This is also the consistent realization of many wise leaders in the Kuomintang in the past, and they have constantly used this to warn their comrades to take external tolerance and internal self-improvement as the basic attitude. Unfortunately, the situation has not been stable for years. On the one hand, there is the reality of regional divisions within the party, and on the other hand, it suffers from the coldness of the people outside the party. This phenomenon, rather than being said to be the misfortune of the Kuomintang, is more accurately the misfortune of China. We deeply hope that the Kuomintang can, under the fair self-examination of the highest leader, remove the old and renew itself, unite and strengthen itself in the near future. More importantly, it must be able to approach the people, fight with the people, and believe in the people in order to win the support of the people, and then it will be possible to concentrate the national strength and jointly complete the great cause of revolution and nation-building.</p>
<p>Under this premise, we deeply feel that Mr. Gongbo's correct argument on the Kuomintang and constitutionalism is indeed the victorious road to advancing toward revolution and nation-building. Mr. Gongbo said: "Why do people want to implement constitutionalism? Naturally, it is a sign of opposing one-party autocracy and demanding the return of power to the people. On this point, I really sympathize and am willing to do my best to promote it." Mr. Gongbo also firmly pointed out: "It has been thirty-four years since the founding of the Republic of China, and there has never been a constitution that has been adhered to by all. This is a joke and a shame... I not only sympathize with the implementation of constitutionalism and the establishment of representative bodies, but I am also more willing to promote the date of implementation and establishment." Mr. Gong is the highest leader of the Party and government in the Peaceful Region today. This firm, clear, and sincere attitude, I believe, will certainly be admired by all parties in the country.</p>
<p>In addition to congratulating the wise expression of the highest authorities of the Party and government in the Peaceful Region, based on our superficial views, there are still three points of hope that we would like to take this opportunity to raise to Mr. Gongbo and all those who have the Way:</p>
<p>First, although the people of the whole country believe that one-party autocracy is a major obstacle to the success of revolution and nation-building, we do not believe that the current politics in the Peaceful Region is one-party autocracy. Therefore, our current task is not to passively resist one-party autocracy, but to actively promote constitutional government, democracy, and the rule of law. We believe that today everyone, regardless of party or region, should strive to promote the implementation of constitutionalism, which is a positive and constructive cooperation, rather than a passive, divisive struggle.</p>
<p>Second, at the current stage, the common task of all Chinese people, regardless of whether they are officials or civilians, is to get rid of the imperialist aggression and the crisis of the destruction of our nation, and to unite the countries of East Asia to fight together. Therefore, we must concentrate the national strength internally. Only under this goal do we need a strong government that is trusted and supported by the majority of the people. This government must pay attention to political reform and make politics gradually clear. At the same time, this government must stand with the people. In order to realize this urgent requirement, our minimum goal is not the ideal "immediate implementation of constitutionalism," but to establish a true representative body as soon as possible, so that the government and the people can be closely united as one to cope with the urgent needs of the internal and external situation.</p>
<p>Third, after the establishment of the representative body and the sound execution of its tasks, uniting the people and the government to devote themselves to the great East Asian War against imperialism, the great cause of nation-building and restoration will unfold before us, and that is when we put forward the maximum goal, that is, the realization of constitutionalism. However, constitutionalism is by no means an overnight success. At that time, if we hastily prepare for everything, it will inevitably be too hasty. Therefore, after the establishment of the representative body, on the one hand, we must give full play to its role as a bridge between the government and the people, and on the other hand, we must actively promote the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism, so that as soon as the war ends, it will be possible to convene a true National Assembly to discuss and formulate a constitution, and then establish a democratic republic government.</p>

<p>If we observe the Kuomintang from the position of an outsider today with a cool head, it is really nothing more than an ordinary political party, and sometimes not even as good as an ordinary political party. This is because ordinary political parties, during elections, still promote their party platforms and political programs to the public in order to win public approval and secure victory. As for the Kuomintang, apart from solemnly reciting the will of the Generalissimo in meetings, who would promote the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Outline of National Reconstruction, or the Three Principles of the People to the public? Not only do they not promote them to the public, but they themselves are merely reciting them as if they were sacred edicts, reading them aloud but not knowing what they mean. No wonder the Kuomintang boasts every year that it has 400,000 members, a number that neither increases nor decreases.</p>
<p>It is not enough for the Kuomintang to have created the name of the Republic of China, nor is it enough to have achieved the nominal unification of the country. Our greatest goal lies in equalizing land ownership and regulating capital. According to my research, equalizing land ownership is just a method, its spirit is to oppose feudalism; regulating capital is also just a method, its spirit is to oppose capitalism. The former aims to embark on the path of a modern nation-state, the latter aims to prevent the occurrence of social revolution. Only those who understand this purpose can be considered members of the Kuomintang, and only those who can implement this purpose can be considered a sound Kuomintang.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang's proposition was originally to oppose feudalism, but recently it has become a feudalistic group. I remember back in 1929, the so-called Reorganization Faction once opposed the designated system of the Third National Congress. In all fairness, when we insisted on electing representatives, we did not have the slightest intention of seizing power for the Reorganization Faction, nor the slightest intention of opposing the Nanjing government, nor the slightest intention of undermining the unity of the party. On the contrary, we were genuinely concerned about the future destiny of the party and the future of the country. If the delegates to the Congress are appointed by the central government, the members of the provincial party headquarters are appointed by the organization department, and the party headquarters of each county and city are also appointed by the provincial members, then the party headquarters will be separated from the party members, and the party headquarters will be even more separated from the public. If party members do not have the right to be elected or the right to vote, what relationship do they have with the party? If the organizational structure is not established by the will of the party members, what interest do they have in the party? Moreover, because of the appointments, the opinions of local officials have to be respected, and private individuals of local officials have to be appointed. Originally, the party was supposed to supervise officials who were party members, but as a result, it became an appendage and decoration of officials within the party. The party became a system of countless private individuals, and naturally became a feudalistic group. If the party becomes feudalistic, all ideals of democratic centralism become empty talk. If the party is not democratic, how can it be centralized? If power is fragmented, there is no way to be democratic. This is the biggest fatal flaw of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang was originally anti-capitalist, but since 1929, those in power have become capitalists. The party has neither the power to sanction them, nor even the courage to criticize a party member who holds political power, and the individual who holds the highest power is too concerned and not well-informed. Naturally, party members will use their positions to accumulate personal gain. Since the Kuomintang came to power, apart from creating many capitalists and petty capitalists attached to high officials, the Kuomintang has contributed too little to the country. The general public has no way to distinguish the Kuomintang from other political parties, let alone distinguish between Kuomintang warlords and bureaucrats. Anti-capitalism is out of the question, and even national capital cannot be formed by these bureaucratic capitalists. Isn't this the Kuomintang's fatal flaw?</p>
<p>To be honest, the Kuomintang can still nominally be in power today, not because of the party's platform, nor because of the party's strength, but because the public still remembers the past achievements of the Kuomintang's martyrs in building the nation, and because the country is in a difficult situation, and no party has been found to replace the Kuomintang for the time being. Therefore, they can only place their last hope on the Kuomintang. This is not reason but emotion, or even a kind of environmental compulsion. This kind of nostalgia is limited and has a time limit. If we do not reform as soon as possible, the Kuomintang will inevitably decline.</p>
<p>Thorough Reform of the Kuomintang's Organization</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Kuomintang should urgently restore its original purpose and spirit. As for the organization, I am also willing to offer frank criticism. What I call organization includes organization, training, and strategy.</p>
<p>First, organization. I have always advocated that the party should be secret. I have two reasons: First, the Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, and the nature of a revolutionary party is to struggle. Judging from the overall situation in China, the revolutionary party has not succeeded, and is too far from success, so it needs to struggle. In military struggles, victory lies in knowing yourself and your enemy, so that you can win every battle. Military struggles are like this, and political struggles are also like this. Once the party is made public, it will not be able to know the enemy, but will be known by the enemy first. Then there will be no way to start the struggle. What's more, there are people who want to subvert the Republic of China, people who want to overthrow the government, and people who want to eliminate the Kuomintang. In this way, the general party members still do not understand the secrets of the party. I really don't know why. Second, there is a famous saying in the party's struggle: "Secrecy is power." Whether the party loses its power when it is made public or not, at least the party members believe that success reduces their enthusiasm for struggle. Now many parties are vying for the party to be made public, believing that without publicity, work cannot be done. They also have their own reasons. For example, social movements believe that if mass organizations are controlled by the party, registration requires the party's permission, and actions require the party's guidance, it is very convenient. But we must know that if mass organizations are voluntary and willing, then there is no problem. But if they are forced to comply with the regulations, they will first leave the masses with a very bad impression of the party. Moreover, if there is a strong party group of ours in a mass organization, then it does not matter whether it is controlled by the party or not. If the party group cannot play a role in it, what is the use of even if it is nominally controlled by the party? Naturally, some party members will say that the party has a way to manage the masses, but the government does not. But we have forgotten an important fact, that the majority of those in charge of the government are party members. Is it that a party member can be effective with the masses when serving in the party headquarters, but not when serving in the government? If not, then that theory is not valid. If so, then that is a serious problem of the Kuomintang itself, not whether the party is public or not, or whether the party controls mass organizations or not. Also, if the party needs to be public to be effective, then the Tongmenghui was not public at that time, and must not be public. According to this reasoning, there would be no revolution in China, and the Republic of China would not have been established. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Conflict Between the Chongqing Government and the Communists Tends Toward a Political Solution <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Chongqing, 4th. Broadcast of the situation of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists as follows: The Yan'an army has been resisting in the Chunhua and Yetai Mountain area for a week. On June 28th, after encountering fierce artillery fire from the Chongqing army, they retreated to the rear. The Chongqing army has taken over the area and stopped advancing. The two sides each have three divisions of troops facing each other. In the future, it seems that they will seek a solution through political negotiations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Asahi Shimbun's editorial on the 6th, entitled "The Limits of the Kuomintang-Communist Civil War," discusses the following:</p>
<p>According to recent reports, there have been frequent incidents of armed conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist armies. The Communist side's goal is to insist on using the Soviet Union as a background to fight against the Kuomintang army in order to establish a united front regime. However, Chongqing has stronger military power than the Communist Party, so the Communist Party strives to avoid armed confrontation with the Chongqing army. However, as long as it is expected that there is absolutely no danger of expanding to a full-scale war of resistance, it will sometimes take the greatest risk in order to achieve political results. This time, the Communist Party had to give up its attack unwillingly, and its heart must be extremely sad. This armed conflict was probably not caused by the Chongqing army's provocation. Since the Communist Party holds the initiative, the armed conflict is only local, sporadic, and peripheral, but it is not impossible to expand to a full-scale armed conflict. They claim independence and autonomy in their war of resistance against Japan, but on the other hand, they are acting perversely. This is truly a tragedy between "tears and laughter" as Lin Yutang said. The tragedy contains comedic elements. In the China of the War of Resistance, this contradiction is also a tragicomedy. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have lost their autonomy in solving problems today. Both sides listen to the instigation of people behind the scenes. Therefore, within the China of the War of Resistance, only this kind of peripheral conflict cannot restrain the intentions of the people behind the scenes. The continued outbreak of civil war will never make the compromise of reconciliation suffer. General observation of this kind of armed conflict will lead to a full-scale armed confrontation between the two sides, which cannot be fully believed.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Prince Xavier and Others Do Their Utmost to Defend Pétain. The Old General Saved Many Lives. <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Paris news: Prince Xavier of Habsburg, nephew of Prince Parma, was summoned to the Paris District Court on Monday to defend Marshal Pétain as a witness. Prince Xavier led the French secret movement and was detained in the famous Dachau concentration camp. He testified in court: "No one in the Dachau concentration camp slandered Marshal Pétain. After Pétain came out to mediate for France, countless French lives were saved." Later, General Leickart (Leickart was a mediator between the German and French people during the German occupation of France) testified in court, stating that in 1941, Marshal Pétain dispatched Grusard, the Attorney General of the French National Security Police, to discuss with former British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Minister Eden. The purpose of the French envoy to England was to change the British blockade against Pétain's side and to ease the anti-Pétain movement in Britain at that time." After Leickart's statement, Prince Xavier continued, "I had 120 servants of the Marquis under my command. At that time, many French aristocrats participated in the war. Marshal Pétain saw that the general aristocratic French were about to be executed by the Germans and tried his best to mediate to avoid the disaster. Therefore, in my Dachau concentration camp, there was indeed no one who said half a word against Marshal Pétain." After a slight pause, he continued, "In mid-May of 1943, I personally heard Pétain say, 'I firmly believe that the Allied forces will win, but this victory will take a long time. I am now a criminal, so I will never write any letters that have not been inspected or send any telegrams that have not been inspected.'" After Mr. A spoke, General Audet (Mr. Au is 62 years old and was a general in the French reserve army) testified, "Since July 1941, my French military headquarters has repeatedly encouraged the storage of weapons. By the end of this year, the military department had stored most of the weapons in secret depots. At that time, the Vichy government was still thinking of making a list of the necessary weapons and sending them to the Allied forces, intending to establish secret factories to manufacture a large number of armored troops and hand grenades. Therefore, it is now feared that all the large number of weapons are secretly stored somewhere. We can spend twenty years to discover these weapons." Later, General Laffargue testified, "The armistice agreement saved the lives of many French troops and the people of North Africa. This armistice agreement can also be said to have saved the lives of many British, Soviet, and even American people. We are fortunate to have Marshal Pétain leading us. If we turned to General Weygand or Foch, then everything of ours would have been lost." After the speech, the trial was adjourned again.</p>

<p>After the city suffered air raids, the lives and properties of citizens were greatly damaged. Rescue, treatment of the wounded, and accommodation of refugees all require huge sums of money, relying on citizens from all walks of life to contribute money and effort to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, and others yesterday submitted valuable items to the Air Defense Headquarters to be used as air defense relief funds. This spirit of public service is commendable. Standing from the perspective of citizens, we should respond urgently to maximize effectiveness.</p>
<p>This newspaper previously launched the Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition, hoping that collectors of calligraphy and paintings would donate their works. After a considerable number are collected, they will be publicly exhibited for charity, with all proceeds going to air defense relief funds. Our intention is the same as that of Mayor Zhou and others. However, although there has been no shortage of participants in recent days, the response has not been enthusiastic. We have now hired three painters, Wu Hufan, Chen Dingshan, and Wang Yayang, to oversee the matter. We hope that people from all walks of life will emulate the benevolent spirit of Mayor Zhou and others and donate ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings. All donations are welcome.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute is experiencing financial difficulties, and the lives of poor children are difficult to sustain. Last November, the Civic Welfare Association of the city gave 4.48 million yuan in football donations. It has been eight months since then, and there has been no extensive fundraising, relying on borrowing to maintain operations. The institute has housed a total of 181 poor children by the end of May this year, and also issued 350,000 yuan in evacuation fees, that is, 90 children were automatically dismissed, each receiving a severance pay of 23,000 yuan, totaling more than 2 million yuan. Thirty-six other disadvantaged children were evacuated to the Songjiang Orphanage to be raised. The evacuation fee of one car for the Songjiang Orphanage cost more than one million yuan. In total, 126 people were evacuated. However, the monthly subsidy for children raised in the Songjiang Orphanage is 1 million yuan, and there are 55 disadvantaged children who cannot be evacuated and are still raised at the Shanghai Institute, including a 40-member boys' band and a 15-member girls' sewing class. Therefore, the minimum monthly expenses required are more than 10 million yuan. The institute originally had no designated funds, and 91 poor children are being raised, all crying for food, hoping that great philanthropists will actively contribute to sustain the lives of the poor children. The institute's handmade arts and crafts products, stock line mesh bags, will be presented to great benefactors. Those who donate 1 million yuan will receive ten dozen mesh bags. Donations should be sent to the General Office of the institute at 148 Ding'an Road, or please call 82686 to arrange for someone to pick them up.</p>
