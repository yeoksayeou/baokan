<h3>冲繩島周圍海面　沉毀敵艦十二艘　日軍特攻隊施以不斷猛攻</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　冲繩島南部敵軍，廿三日在上原與棚原之一綫開始進攻，其兵力約一千，坦克車十數輛，日軍堅守第一綫陣地奮戰中。當山以西地區，敵軍以其軍械人員向前推進，準備次期作戰。自本月十九日敵軍開始攻擊以來，截至廿三日正午止，日軍殺傷敵兵約達六千，擊毀坦克車八十輛，破壞大砲十一尊，破壞軍用品堆積所四起，包括載貨汽車軍火等，又日軍藏獲迫擊砲二尊，重機槍二十六挺，機關砲一門，射擊坦克車之火剪砲二尊。至於海面戰局，日軍特攻隊之攻擊甚猛，廿二日查明繫沉及擊毀航空母艦戰艦巡洋艦等大型艦船十二艘，又擊傷艦種不明之軍艦數艘。</p>
<p>西南基地二十四日中央社電　冲繩島周圍仍有敵艦除活動，二十三日下午，其一部接近該島南部西岸並加以轟擊，二十三日來襲冲繩之敵機全數有三百數十架，日神風特攻隊二十二日在冲繩島北東海面攻擊敵艦，擊沉艦種不明之軍艦二艘以上，另一機隊在慶良間島附近擊毀大型輸送船一艘，二十三日晨巾城灣之日守軍擊沉來攻之敵驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<p>中央社滬訊　據美國太平洋艦隊星期一發表：四月二十日硫黃島美軍，曾與該島殘留日軍交戰達二十四小時，按此報告，現在硫黃島尙有日軍據山洞內强固陣地，繼續與美軍作戰。</p>
<h3>敵機侵襲日本土　墜毀廿六架　台灣北部再遭盲炸</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　馬里亞納基地B29型機約一百二十架，集合於伊豆南方海面，編成數梯團，於二十四日上午八時二十分許，從下田西方侵入，以主力轟炸立川方，目下尙在調查中，惟預料日方空陸邀擊戰果甚大，截至上午十一時為止，飛行部隊所獲戰果已經查明者，計擊落六架，擊毀二十架以上，其他高射砲部隊戰果似亦相富多數。</p>
<p>台北二十三日中央社電　二十三日敵轟炸機約三十五架，戰鬥機約三十架，由菲島薇地來襲台北地區，其一部轟炸花連港及新竹州部落十二所，是日晨敵大型機架曾襲台北附近，盲炸民家，但損失輕微。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　自菲島冲繩占役後，敵方對於日本土之戰略轟炸，規模頓見擴大，預料今後更大舉來犯，惟敵機每次來襲，均受重大損害。彼等摧殘戰力，擾亂民心，沮喪戰意之企圖，在日本全國軍官民一體的邀擊陣綫之前，無法逞其野心。</p>
<h3>日政會支部　組織决定</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　大日本政治會之支部組織問題，旣與政府當局成立諒解，二十四日正式決定，即以支部長幹事長為中心，强化厚生實踐部，戰事生活部，庶務部，更在各地方行政協議會地區設聯合會，置會長，由地方會員中選任名流為支部長，一切人事與機構預定於五月間成就。又對於政府組織之國民義勇隊，由各支部盡力協助，於是國民組繼態勢以完遂戰爭保衛國土為目標成立。</p>
<h3>日全國實施　國民登記</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本定自五月一日起，除東京都以外，全國各地實施國民登記，凡男子滿十二歲以上六十歲以下，女子滿十二歲以上四十歲以下，均須串請登記。但現役軍人應召入伍者，陸海軍學生·軍屬·暨師·齒科醫師·藥劑師·看護婦·獸醫師·船員·科學技術人員之業經登記者以及在國民學校求學者·巳有配偶之女子·則不在此限。</p>
<h3>日靖國神社　春季臨時大祭</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本今年春季靖國神社臨時大祭，定廿五日在靖國神社舉行，由吉田善吾海軍大將任大祭委員長，先於廿四日舉行招魂祭，此次臨時大祭，新祭神計有四萬一千三百十八各，包括在馬紹爾一役陣亡之海軍少佐伏見博英伯爵·聯合艦隊司令長官山本五十六元帥·婆羅洲陣亡之前田利為大將等。</p>
<h3>論舊金山會議</h3>
<p>謀略宣傳，是戰爭的一種手段。英美兩國，因為鑲內政治·國際外交·軍事及經濟財政關係，不得不希望早日結束反對日德軸心國家的戰爭，因而目前積極從事於謀略宣傳。四月二十五日，在美國面臨太平洋的西岸舊金山將召開的「聯合國戰後國際安全保障會議」，又名「舊金山會議」，就是謀略宣傳中的尤者。凡是所謂謀略，就是不僅絕對沒有眞心誠意，而且還採用招搖撞騙，威脅利誘，恫嚇拉攏等種類繁多的手法。就舊金山會議的構想及召集的始末說，恰是謀略的典型表現。但英美的詐術，由於傍若無人和睥腉一世的態度，處處雖都露出馬脚，但仍不顧一切，拚命想完成自己的野心。</p>
<p>登塲角色</p>
<p>舊金山會議，是根據今年二月克里米亞會談的結果，以英美蘇三國為發起人，而召集四十四個聯合國開會的。所以會議的表面目的，似乎是為了去年十月在美國鄧巴頓奧克斯會談所決定的世界和平及安全的一般國際機構草案，以及克里米亞會談所決定的該機構投票手續草案，加以審查和評議。但實際上，是英美蘇三國包辦下的宰割世界機關。邀請入會的鑲家，固然有澳洲·比利時·玻利維亞·巴西·加拿大·智利·重慶·哥倫比亞·科斯塔黎加·古巴，捷克斯拉夫·多密尼克·埃及·挨爾·薩爾瓦多·厄瓜多爾·阿比西尼亞·法國·希臘·瓜地危拉·海地·洪都拉斯·印度·伊朗·伊拉克·利比里亞·處森堡·墨西哥·荷蘭·新西蘭·尼古拉瓜·挪威·巴拿為·巴拉圭·秘營·菲律賓·蘇丹阿拉伯·土耳其·南非聯邦·蘇聯·英國·美國·烏拉圭·委內瑞拉·南斯拉夫等國。但除掉英美蘇三國外，其他大部份國家，不是有名無實的流亡政府，就是被三國壓迫而參加聯合國陣營的國家，其中如智利·秘魯·委內瑞拉·烏拉圭·厄瓜多網·巴拉圭·土耳其·伊朗·埃及等國，不僅在政治上和經濟上受到種種的壓迫，同時還受到威嚇說，如不在三月一日前向日德軸心國家宣戰，則休想戰後利益的均霑，所以這些國家不得已便宣戰了。還有一直到最近都曾勇敢地抵抗過英美的壓迫，事實上始終堅持中立的南美大國阿根廷，也終於受英美壓迫不過，而在三月二十七日向軸心宣戰了</p>
<p>英美用意</p>
<p>利誘而參加舊金山會議的。如果檢討一下舊金山會議的基礎鄧巴頓奧克斯草案，就立刻可以　破「戰後國際安全保障會議」的戲法。特戈爾政權的法國·老早就言穿了英美蘇的野心陰謀，所以就拒絕充任會議招請國。依賴英美生存的重慶，固然和英美蘇平列美成為招請國，但這不過是根據英美的策謀想使重慶作統制東亞的工具而已。鄧巴頓奧克斯草案的內容，即戰後國際安全保障草案的內容，固然是去年十月發表的反軸心聯合國聯盟計劃，但新國際聯盟的組織與機能，是與縷成此次世界大戰禍根的前此國際聯盟，同工異曲的，如具偎檢討一下這種組織，就可以知道是非常有害的機構。新國際聯盟下有聯盟總會·安全保障理事會·經濟社會理事會·國際司法裁判所·秘書處等五個機關，由此等機關來處理一切的國際關係，但實權則操之於以英美蘇三國為主體的常務理事會中，小國也可以說沒有什麽發言權。這就可以很淸楚地　出來，英美竟自撕毀了自己所標榜的戰爭目的大西洋憲章，藉此新組織來我行我素地驅使各小國。試看安全保障理事會的明文規定：</p>
<p>「理事會員定為十一國，常務理事會則由英美蘇渝構成之，可能時法國亦參加。理事會握有預防侵略之全權，無需微求全體會員國之意向，可採取行動，使用陸海空兵力。」</p>
<p>這樣很明顯地可以看出來，英美蘇三國事實上武力支配此界的形勢。無實力的重慶和法國，雖說是常務理事國，但能作什麼？這是不言而喻的事實。此外關於處理糾紛的方法有明文規定說：</p>
<p>「設立軍事委員會，為實際指導行使武力之機關，該機關由英美蘇渝四圍參謀部代表組成之。」</p>
<p>這就是說，按英美蘇的高興與否而來行使武力維持和平，行使武力維持和平，就是武裝和平的意思，亦不外是另一種形式的戰爭。國際安全保障機構，不過徒擁虛名，而供英美蘇三國支配世界的機關而已。</p>
<p>蘇聯冷淡</p>
<p>保障理事會的投票手續，英美蘇的議論紛紜，莫衷一是，至克里米亞會談，方趨一致，但蘇聯主張糾紛常事國也有投票權，英美勉强與之妥協，便規定：</p>
<p>「糾粉當事國不論是否為常務理事，一律無投票權，但行使武力及其他重大決定時，則須常務理事國全部之贊成。」</p>
<p>這樣便告一段落。但蘇聯與英美不同，具有另外遠大的企岡，靠其獨自的政治力·外交力以及軍事力，在東歐·近東·巴爾幹以及地中海沿岸，突飛猛進地扶權勢力，自然不喜歡英美靠舊金山會議來拘束其行動之自由·所以對於該會議表示相當冷淡的態度。即從英美蘇三國間的關係說，舊金山會議的前途，悖大不可樂觀。且往往以大國自負的巴西·澳洲·加拿大·挪威·荷蘭等國，並未當上常務理事國，竟屈居重慶之下，自然會氣憤塡胸。尤其是歐洲大陸一角的指導國法蘭西，更是所有具有不滿情緒的小國之中心勢力，這一點是値得特別重視的。特戈爾政權的情報部長皮耶爾·蒂因曾經聲明，鄧巴頓奥克斯草案對於世界安全保障毫無用處，所以業已通知舊金山會議而提出修正案來。但用威脅利誘來拉攏小國的英美，按照預定圈套，强奸他國意見地召集舊金山會議，藉作向全世界擴大宜傳的資料。然面他們所要建立的和平，就是對英美蘇有利的武裝和平，對於小國則是可望而不可即的和平。旣然武裝和平不過是戰爭的一個形態，那末舊金山會議就不外是第三次世界大戰的醖釀罷。（譯自四月三日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞大使會議的成果</h3>
<p>敵方以討論未來國際組織問題為中心，喧嚷已久的舊金山會議，正將開會之際，東亞各國大使先在東京舉行大東亞大使會議。這次會議在事前並未作何宣傳，絕對不如舊金山會議的具有國際謀略的意義；而在全體一致的四項決議和共同聲明中，却表現了眞誠平等共存共榮的精神。</p>
<p>大東亞大使會議的四項決議中，第一第二二項，為共同支援越南各國及東印度各民族完威獨立，這正是以事實說明大東亞戰爭的真正目的，說明其為爭取殖民地民族解放的進步的性質；而第四項對印度臨時政府的決義，也是同一目的的具體證明；這三項決議，已種解決了舊金山會議中，勢將聚訟不休的戰後殖民地處分問題和世界新秩序問題。而第三項關於大東亞會議常設連絡機關的決議，使人想到舊金山會議在開會前已引起英美蘇紛爭的國際新機構問題，我們立為與利害一致的東亞各國，已經把這個問題先行解決了。</p>
<p>其次，大東亞大使會議通過了共同聲明，再度闡明大東亞戰爭的意義和目的，駁斥了敵方對於盟邦及大東亞戰爭種種不近事實的宣傳；同時重申集中十僮民族總力完遂戰爭的決心，而其七項決意原文，更是一九四三年十一月大日大東亞共同宣言的具體化的說明，再度表明為建設眞正平等自由的世界新秩序的指導原貝。</p>
<p>經過這次大東亞大使會議之後，使東亞十億民族，對於大東亞戰爭更進一步認識，更堅定必勝信念。同時，我們深信大會的共同宣言。將是未來世界新秩序建設的最高原則。而對集注目光於舊金山的世人，給予有力的警告。</p>
<p>再論舊金山會議</p>
<p>舊金山會議雖於今日如期舉行，但其本質已因羅斯福之逝世而發生重大的轉變。羅斯福一直以美帝國主義的世界制覇政策為目標，企圖在這次戰爭中和戰爭結束後，建立唯美帝國主義馬首是瞻的新國際組織，藉以操縱全世界的政治和經濟，擴張美國的覇權。他利用外交的謀略捕絡了英國，他用了優勢的物資和權術，限制了蘇聯的苛求；從去年的鄧巴頓奧克斯會議至今年的克里米亞會議，他勉强使英蘇就範，而預備在舊金山會議中實現野心。</p>
<p>現在舊金山會議雖如期舉行，但是由於羅斯福的逝世，美國在會議中能否繼續保持盟主的地位，已是一大疑問，蘇聯之乘機加派外委長莫洛托夫出席，顯有値得重視的政治意義。姑不論會議前夕，因波蘭問題而引起英美蘇間的對立如何激化，至少在羅斯福輩所曾夢想的，利用舊金山會議誘使蘇聯參加東亞戰爭，加强對日壓迫，顯然已有「今昔異勢」之感了。</p>
<p>舊金山會議的主要任務，是在討論戰後國際保障和平與安全問題，實現大國專制和獨占的世界新機構，但是，在國家制度根本不同的英美和蘇聯，將來同床異夢貌合神離是必然的均勢，這樣就高度地限制了新機構的運用；另一方面，新機構為大國的利害所左右，不免變成大國互相角逐利益的擂台，將成為下一次戰爭的準備機關；我們相信，世界各小網讀到了日前大東亞大使會議的共同聲明，必將有所猛省！</p>
<p>至於重慶代表參加會議，不僅不能代表全東亞十億民族，更在列强自私自利的競爭之中，為得者不過列名湀熱鬧而已！與其空無實的夢想，不如切實的協力促成大東亞大使會的為同聲叫與決議案的實現！</p>
<h3>東亞基於道義　確立永久和平　陳代主席發表談話</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　國府陳代主席於本月十六日赴華北視察一般政務，於視察完畢後，日前飛抵上海，二十四日由滬乘車返抵首都，同行之褚外交部長趙宣傳部長周文官長等，亦同返首都。</p>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　陳代主席對舊金山會議發表談話如下：舊金山會議乃由英美等反軸心國在克里米亞會議之後而產生，其原意以為本年春季歐戰可告結東，世界大局漸見明朗，即將藉此會議討論結束戰事，以及政治善後等問題，而尤要者，在於世界和平之新機構。惟詳加硏討此會之威效，本難確期，况歐洲戰事日來雖異常緊迫，言解決之期尙遠，太平洋戰事更在進行中，絕難操有勝算，戰事旣未結東，則戰後政治之姿態亦難想像，善後問題豈易置詞。此次會議，蘇聯與英美問已因投票權與波蘭出席問題，引起不少料紛，將來開會之際，角逐壇玷，自在意中。至其他各小國，多出英美之提携以壯聲勢，事實上未即能左右會議，况羅斯福逝世，對外政策繼任者雖已聲明一仍舊貫，但緩急輕重之間，自復與前不同，强弱之際亦更必右所肝輊。前次會議重心屬諸羅氏，固無疑義，現今人選旣定，誰為領導者更必多一重周折。總之，世界舊秩序旣已不能維持，而發生東西洋之戰禍，則國際問關於維持和平新機構之建立，自屬必要。東亞民族酷好和平，惟所酷好之和平，乃眞正之水久和平，舊金山會議結果恐仍將不免重蹈國際聯盟之覆轍，其不能樹立永久和平之機構，以保障國際安全，彰彰明甚。本月二十三日盟邦日本為消戢英美制覇全球之野心，完成大東亞各國之獨立解放，已在東京召開大東亞大使會議，該會議擬慕於政治平等。經濟互惠。及尊重固有文化，消除人種歧視之原則，作樹立世界新秩序國際新機構之張本，當為大東亞各國所一致擁護。我國旣立國東亞，自當沉毅堅强，一秉棄志，期於戰爭勝利之下，獲得世界合理之永久和平，今茲舊金山會議，固尙未足以語此也。</p>

<h3>盼市民協力防空　燈光不使外洩　防空本部當局發表談話</h3>
<p>本市防空當局，因鑒於現當大東亞戰爭巳入決戰階段，空襲之危險，絕難避免，且敵機一再來滬侵襲，故對堅强防空陣容，急不容緩，市民亦應全力以赴，協力防空任務。惟查市民對防空設備，均禾完善，過去電燈上十九巳有防空燈罩，而於電力公司為節約電力，調整使用電燈時間，每晚至十時止後，市民即改用煤油燈或燈燭等取光，而是項油燈等均無防　罩之設置，以致燈光往往洩漏，殊為非是。故望市民於各種燈光使用時，亦應謹防燈光之外洩，予以妥善之處置，非但於聞得警報後，須將燈光熄滅，即於平時入晚後，亦須使燈光絕不外洩，蓋滬境隨時有敵機侵襲之可能也。否則一經警局人員查出，即以還反燈火管制論，依章從嚴處分</p>
<p>防空本部　發表談話</p>
<p>又市民防　本部發表談話謂：「本市在大東亞戰爭決勝階段內，空襲的危險，是絕對不能避免的，市民往往漫不經心，甚至還抱着從前租界是「保險地區」的卑劣思想，以致遇到空襲，不獨毫無緊張的情緒，還有一種抱隔岸觀火的態度，即或為着防空勉强的躲避或是遮蔽燈火，也不過是畏　處罰，虛應故事而已，決非內心自動的作為，只求沒有人察覺，白天便不妨翹首天空，目送飛鴻，夜晚亦即毫無顧忌，將燈火開亮，上空是否窺見我們行動或亮光，全然不管。要知這種行為危險最大，不獨個人及自家安全所繫，亦與左右鄰舍的安全攸關，推而及於全市區的安全，亦將被彼一人破壞，故對是種人戴裕的批評，簡直可謂「防空的害羣之馬」，為全市民眾所共棄的。所以我們不獨要檢點個人及自家的防空責任是否已盜，並且還要防止別人或別戶的不盡責，然後才能減少空襲的損害。所以吾人所絕對注意第一白天或夜晚遇到空襲，要有秩序的進入防空壕，切勿在路上觀望，第二夜晚遇到空襲，切勿開燈，及燃其他燭燈，絕對避免燈光外洩，以避免無謂犧牲」。</p>

<p>第四條　本市征收營業稅課稅標準，暫以營業總收入額及營業資本額之兩種為限。前項營榮總收入額之計算，應以每季總收入額為準，其營業資本額之計算，以實際供營業用者為準，如公積金等應作資本額論。（未完）</p>

<h3>大東亞民族建設　理想世界秩序　松平部長對大使會議感想</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，松平情報部長對大東亞各國大使會議所發表之共同聲明，發表感想如次：</p>
<p>理想中的世界秩序</p>
<p>大東國大使會議之共同聲明，係將多年來我亞細亞人欲言而不敢言之一切，向全世界盡量披露，本人感覺有如籠中之鳥，一旦飛向廣大之天空，腦海中所留之一片黑　，一　時間，全吿消滅。敵人英美對前年十一月間之大東亞宜言感覺非常威脅，深恐大東亞人自決太快，故即舉行開羅會議，將重慶政權牽入自己陣容中，同時造成亞細亞人解放之氣氛。嗣後更進一步，計劃造成英美本位之世界，將亞細亞强行納入此世界中，美國並以自己為中心揑造國際機構案，將在舊金山會議時，不顧一切的使各國加以承認。但大東亞各國所理想中的世界秩序，與英美本位之世界秩序，觀於以下各點相較之下，實有霄壤之別</p>
<p>英美觀念本末顛倒</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰因何而起，英美並不根究其原因所在，一味欲遏止戰爭確立和平，此實為其根本上之缺點。此次大戰起因，於英美欲閉塞日德意三國民族這發展機會，人為的阻止其進步。關於此點，此次大東亞各國大使會議發表之共同聲明第七項中云：「關於安全保障機構，則力避大國之獨斷，及全世界劃一之方法，而以適合實情之地方的安全保障體制，樹立能以世界各種保障機構併用之秩序，且適應不斷進展之世界各種情勢開拓，使國際秩序改變為和平的途徑。」然而在鄧巴頓奧克斯的國際機構案中，並無此根本觀念，猶之治病不動刀圭以袪病源，實是本末顚倒。</p>
<p>世界秩序根本觀念</p>
<p>世界秩序之根本觀念，應在為全人類謀幸福，衣食住三字固不具論，即在知識思想等各方面，亦應使全人類滿足，換言之，國際平等即為根本理念。故我人主張不問國之大小，須獲得政治上之平等，經濟上之衛護，及固有文化之尊重。但在英美之國際機構案中所表現者，與此完全相反，大國欲支配小國，弱肉强食，所謂國際平等云云，無異綠木求魚。</p>
<p>英美榨取各殖民地</p>
<p>向來英美以在國自豪者，因有殲民地供其剝削，以殖民地住民之犧牲，作為其獨有之享受，今後則更欲以自場民地所榨取者，完成其戰後之國內復興。故在其國際機構案內，並無關於殖民地之規定。此次舊金山會議前，美國更聲明不願討論此項問題，暗中仍欲維持殖民地之現狀。此次大東亞各國大使會談之共同聲明第三項云：「解放處於場民地地位之各民族，使其各得其所，開拓貢獻推展人類文明之途徑」。以此與英美之思想相互並看，其主張之如何利己，如何不顧他民族之幸福，即可瞭然矣。</p>
<p>建設真正理想秩序</p>
<p>總之，為完成此次戰爭，各國民族所付之莫大犧牲，必須為謀人類進化發展之犧牲，此在英美政治家中，根本即無此種自決之跡象。英美不顧建設理念世界秩序，仍然的要建設利己的英美本位之世界秩序，我人為粉碎如此不合理之世界秩序，根據於國際平等之精神，建設理想的秩序，亟應繼續努力，以血與汗的實際表現，使英美認識我人之理想。</p>

<h3>Around Okinawa Island Waters: Twelve Enemy Warships Sunk and Destroyed; Japanese Special Attack Units Launch Relentless Assault</h3>

Japanese forces also captured two mortars, 26 heavy machine guns, one autocannon, and two rocket launchers for attacking tanks. As for the naval battle situation, the attacks by Japanese special attack units have been very fierce. On the 22nd, it was confirmed that 12 large ships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers, were sunk or destroyed, and several warships of unspecified types were damaged.</p>
<p>Southwest Base, 24th (Central News Agency): Enemy warships are still active around Okinawa Island. On the afternoon of the 23rd, a portion of them approached the southern west coast of the island and bombarded it. On the 23rd, a total of approximately 350 enemy aircraft attacked Okinawa. On the 22nd, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force attacked enemy warships in the northern sea off Okinawa Island, sinking at least two warships of unspecified types. Another unit destroyed a large transport ship near Kerama Island. On the morning of the 23rd, Japanese defending forces in Ginowan Bay sank an attacking enemy destroyer.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: According to an announcement by the U.S. Pacific Fleet on Monday: On April 20th, U.S. forces on Iwo Jima engaged in combat with remaining Japanese forces on the island for 24 hours. According to this report, there are still Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, entrenched in fortified positions within caves, continuing to fight against U.S. forces.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Invade Japanese Homeland: Twenty-Six Aircraft Shot Down; Northern Taiwan Suffers Blind Bombing Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Approximately 120 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana Islands base assembled over the sea south of Izu, formed into several waves, and invaded from the west of Shimoda at approximately 8:20 AM on the 24th, mainly bombing the Tachikawa area. Investigations are currently underway, but it is expected that the results of the Japanese aerial and ground interception efforts will be significant. As of 11:00 AM, the results of the fighting by the aviation units that have already been confirmed include six aircraft shot down and more than 20 aircraft destroyed. It is believed that the results of the anti-aircraft artillery units are also substantial.</p>
<p>Taipei, 23rd (Central News Agency): On the 23rd, approximately 35 enemy bombers and approximately 30 fighter aircraft attacked the Taipei area from Vigan, Philippines. A portion of them bombed Hualien Harbor and 12 villages in Hsinchu Prefecture. On the morning of that day, enemy large aircraft attacked the vicinity of Taipei, blindly bombing civilian houses, but the damage was minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Since the enemy occupied the Philippines and Okinawa, the scale of strategic bombing of the Japanese homeland by the enemy has suddenly expanded. It is expected that larger-scale attacks will occur in the future, but each time enemy aircraft attack, they suffer significant damage. Their attempts to destroy combat capabilities, disrupt public morale, and discourage the will to fight will not be able to fulfill their ambitions in the face of the unified interception front of all military officers and civilians in Japan.</p>
<h3>Organizational Decisions for the Japanese Political Association Branch</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): The issue of the branch organization of the Greater Japan Political Association has been resolved with the government authorities, and it was officially decided on the 24th to strengthen the Welfare Practice Department, the Wartime Living Department, and the General Affairs Department, with the branch chief and secretary-general as the center. Furthermore, joint associations will be established in each local administrative council district, with chairmen selected from local members of prominence as branch chiefs. All personnel and organization are expected to be completed in May. Furthermore, each branch will do its best to assist the National Volunteer Corps organized by the government. Thus, the formation of a national structure is established with the goal of completing the war and defending the homeland.</p>
<h3>National Registration to be Implemented Throughout Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Japan has decided to implement national registration throughout the country, except for Tokyo Prefecture, starting on May 1st. All men aged 12 to 60 and women aged 12 to 40 must apply for registration. However, active military personnel, those called into military service, army and navy students, military personnel, teachers, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, veterinarians, sailors, scientific and technical personnel who have already been registered, as well as students attending national schools, and married women are not subject to this requirement.</p>
<h3>Spring Temporary Grand Festival at Yasukuni Shrine</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency): Japan's spring temporary grand festival at Yasukuni Shrine is scheduled to be held on the 25th at Yasukuni Shrine. Admiral Zengo Yoshida will serve as the chairman of the grand festival committee. A spirit invocation ceremony will be held on the 24th. This temporary grand festival will include 41,318 new enshrined deities, including Count Hirohide Fushimi, a navy lieutenant commander who died in action in the Marshall Islands campaign, Fleet Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and General Toshiyuki Maeda, who died in action in Borneo.</p>
<h3>On the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>Deceptive propaganda is a means of war. Due to domestic political, international diplomatic, military, and economic financial relations, Britain and the United States have no choice but to hope to end the war against the Axis powers of Japan and Germany as soon as possible, and are therefore currently actively engaged in deceptive propaganda. The "United Nations Post-War International Security Conference," also known as the "San Francisco Conference," which will be convened in San Francisco, on the Pacific coast of the United States, on April 25, is the most notable example of deceptive propaganda. Anything that is called deceptive is not only absolutely devoid of sincerity, but also employs a wide variety of methods such as bluffing and cheating, threats and inducements, intimidation and wooing. Judging from the conception and convening of the San Francisco Conference, it is a typical manifestation of deception. But the British and American fraudulent tactics, due to their overbearing and arrogant attitude, reveal their flaws everywhere, but they still ignore everything and desperately want to fulfill their own ambitions.</p>
<p>Participants</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference is based on the results of the Crimea Conference in February of this year, with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as initiators, and summoning 44 United Nations members to meet. Therefore, the apparent purpose of the conference seems to be to review and evaluate the general international organization draft for world peace and security decided at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in the United States last October, and the draft voting procedures for that organization decided at the Crimea Conference. But in reality, it is an organ for dividing the world under the control of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The invited members include Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Chongqing, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominica, Egypt, Ireland, El Salvador, Ecuador, Abyssinia, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Sudan, Arabia, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. But apart from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, most of the other countries are either nominal governments-in-exile, or countries forced to join the United Nations camp under the oppression of the three countries. Among them, countries such as Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Ecuador, Paraguay, Turkey, Iran, and Egypt are not only subjected to various political and economic oppressions, but are also threatened, saying that if they do not declare war on the Axis powers before March 1, they should not expect to share in the benefits after the war, so these countries had no choice but to declare war. There is also Argentina, a large South American country that has always bravely resisted the oppression of Britain and the United States until recently, and has always maintained neutrality in fact, was finally unable to resist the oppression of Britain and the United States, and declared war on the Axis on March 27.</p>
<p>British and American Intentions</p>
<p>induced to participate in the San Francisco Conference. If we examine the Dumbarton Oaks draft, which is the foundation of the San Francisco Conference, we can immediately see through the farce of the "Post-War International Security Conference". The French government of Turgot had long seen through the ambitions and conspiracies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, so it refused to serve as a convening country of the conference. Chongqing, which depends on Britain and the United States for survival, is of course listed as a convening country alongside Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but this is only based on British and American plans to make Chongqing a tool for controlling East Asia. The content of the Dumbarton Oaks draft, that is, the content of the post-war international security draft, is of course the anti-Axis United Nations alliance plan announced last October, but the organization and function of the new League of Nations are the same in different ways as the former League of Nations, which was the root cause of this world war. If we examine this kind of organization, we can know that it is a very harmful institution. The new League of Nations has five organs: the League General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat. These organs handle all international relations, but the real power is in the hands of the permanent council composed mainly of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Small countries can be said to have no say. This can be seen very clearly: Britain and the United States have torn up the Atlantic Charter, which they themselves promoted as the war's objective, and are using this new organization to drive small countries as they please. Just look at the express provisions of the Security Council:</p>
<p>"The Council shall consist of eleven members, and the permanent council shall be composed of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. France may also participate when possible. The Council shall have full power to prevent aggression, and may take action and use land, sea, and air forces without seeking the consent of all member states."</p>
<p>It can be seen very clearly that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are in fact dominating the world by force. What can Chongqing and France, which have no real power, do even if they are permanent council members? This is an obvious fact. In addition, there is an express provision regarding the method of handling disputes:</p>
<p>"A military commission shall be established as the organ for actually guiding the exercise of force. The commission shall be composed of representatives from the general staffs of the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing."</p>
<p>This means that force is used to maintain peace according to whether Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are happy or not. Using force to maintain peace means armed peace, which is nothing more than another form of war. The international security mechanism is just an empty name, and is merely an organ for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to dominate the world.</p>
<p>Soviet Indifference</p>
<p>The voting procedures for the Security Council have been a source of much debate and disagreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. It was not until the Crimea Conference that they reached a consensus, but the Soviet Union insisted that countries that are regularly involved in disputes should also have the right to vote. Britain and the United States reluctantly compromised and stipulated:</p>
<p>"Whether or not a country involved in a dispute is a permanent council member, it has no right to vote. However, when exercising force and making other major decisions, the consent of all permanent council members is required."</p>
<p>Thus, the matter was concluded. But unlike Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union has other far-reaching plans. Relying on its own political, diplomatic, and military power, it has rapidly advanced its influence in Eastern Europe, the Near East, the Balkans, and along the Mediterranean coast. Naturally, it does not like Britain and the United States using the San Francisco Conference to restrict its freedom of action, so it has shown a rather indifferent attitude towards the conference. Even from the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the future of the San Francisco Conference is far from optimistic. Furthermore, countries such as Brazil, Australia, Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands, which often consider themselves to be major powers, have not become permanent council members, and are actually subordinate to Chongqing. They will naturally be filled with anger. In particular, France, a leading country in one corner of the European continent, is the central force of all small countries with dissatisfaction. This is worth special attention. Pierre Tynan, the Minister of Information for the Turgot government, once stated that the Dumbarton Oaks draft is useless for world security, so it has notified the San Francisco Conference and submitted amendments. However, Britain and the United States, who use threats and inducements to win over small countries, are convening the San Francisco Conference according to a predetermined trap, forcibly violating the opinions of other countries, and using it as a source of propaganda to expand to the world. However, the peace they want to establish is an armed peace that is beneficial to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and a peace that is unattainable for small countries. Since armed peace is just a form of war, then the San Francisco Conference is nothing more than the brewing of the Third World War. (Translated from the Daily News, April 3)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Achievements of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference</h3>
<p>Just as the San Francisco Conference, which the enemy has been clamoring about for a long time, focusing on discussing the issue of future international organizations, is about to open, the ambassadors of East Asian countries first held the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference in Tokyo. This conference did not make any publicity beforehand, and is absolutely not as meaningful in terms of international strategy as the San Francisco Conference; but the spirit of sincerity, equality, coexistence, and co-prosperity is expressed in the unanimous four resolutions and the joint statement.</p>
<p>Among the four resolutions of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference, the first and second items are to jointly support the complete independence of Vietnam and the various ethnic groups in East India. This is precisely a factual explanation of the true purpose of the Greater East Asia War, explaining its progressive nature of fighting for the liberation of colonial peoples; and the fourth item regarding the resolution of the Indian Provisional Government is also a concrete proof of the same purpose; these three resolutions have already solved the problem of the post-war disposition of colonies and the problem of a new world order, which will inevitably lead to disputes at the San Francisco Conference. And the third resolution regarding the permanent liaison mechanism of the Greater East Asia Conference reminds people of the problem of a new international organization, which has already caused disputes between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union before the San Francisco Conference was convened. We, standing with the East Asian countries whose interests are aligned, have already solved this problem first.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference passed a joint statement, reiterating the significance and purpose of the Greater East Asia War, refuting the enemy's various unrealistic propaganda about the allied countries and the Greater East Asia War; at the same time, it reiterated the determination to concentrate the total strength of the ten hundred million people to complete the war, and the original text of its seven resolutions is a concrete explanation of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of November 1943, reiterating the guiding principles for building a truly equal and free new world order.</p>
<p>After this Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference, the ten hundred million people of East Asia have gained a further understanding of the Greater East Asia War and are more determined in their belief in victory. At the same time, we firmly believe in the joint declaration of the conference. It will be the highest principle for the construction of a new world order in the future. And it will give a powerful warning to the world who are focusing their attention on San Francisco.</p>
<p>Further Discussion on the San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>Although the San Francisco Conference is being held today as scheduled, its essence has undergone a major change due to the death of Roosevelt. Roosevelt had always aimed at the world domination policy of American imperialism, and attempted to establish a new international organization that would take the lead of American imperialism in this war and after the war, so as to manipulate the politics and economy of the whole world and expand the hegemony of the United States. He used diplomatic strategies to capture Britain, and he used superior materials and tactics to limit the demands of the Soviet Union; from the Dumbarton Oaks Conference last year to the Crimea Conference this year, he forced Britain and the Soviet Union to submit, and prepared to realize his ambitions at the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>Now, although the San Francisco Conference is being held as scheduled, due to the death of Roosevelt, whether the United States can continue to maintain its position as the leader in the conference is a major question. The Soviet Union's opportunistic decision to send Foreign Minister Molotov to attend has obvious political significance that deserves attention. Regardless of how intensified the opposition between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over the Polish issue on the eve of the conference, at least the dream that Roosevelt and his generation had of using the San Francisco Conference to induce the Soviet Union to participate in the East Asian war and strengthen the oppression of Japan, obviously has a sense of "changed circumstances".</p>
<p>The main task of the San Francisco Conference is to discuss the issue of post-war international security of peace, and to realize a new world organization dominated and monopolized by great powers. However, in Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, whose national systems are fundamentally different, it is inevitable that they will have different dreams and be outwardly united but inwardly divided in the future. This highly limits the application of the new organization; on the other hand, the new organization is controlled by the interests of the great powers, and will inevitably become an arena for the great powers to compete for interests, and will become a preparatory mechanism for the next war; we believe that the small nets of the world have read the joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference a few days ago, and they will definitely have some sudden realization!</p>
<p>As for the Chongqing representatives' participation in the conference, they not only cannot represent the ten hundred million people of East Asia, but in the self-serving competition among the great powers, what they gain is only being listed in the crowd! Rather than empty and unrealistic dreams, it is better to sincerely cooperate to promote the realization of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference's joint voice and resolutions!</p>
<h3>East Asia Establishes Permanent Peace Based on Morality: Chairman Chen Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency): Chairman Chen of the National Government went to North China on the 16th of this month to inspect general administrative affairs. After completing the inspection, he flew to Shanghai a few days ago. On the 24th, he returned to the capital by train from Shanghai. Foreign Minister Chu, Minister of Propaganda Zhao, and Chief Secretary Zhou, who accompanied him, also returned to the capital together.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency): Chairman Chen issued the following statement on the San Francisco Conference: The San Francisco Conference was produced by the anti-Axis countries such as Britain and the United States after the Crimea Conference. The original intention was that the European war would end this spring, the world situation would gradually become clear, and this conference would be used to discuss the end of the war, as well as political aftermath issues, and especially the new mechanism for world peace. However, after detailed study of the effectiveness of this conference, it is difficult to be sure. Moreover, although the European war situation has been extremely urgent in recent days, the date of resolution is still far away. The Pacific war is still in progress, and it is absolutely impossible to have a winning chance. Since the war has not ended, the political posture after the war is difficult to imagine, and how can the aftermath problem be easily stated. At this conference, the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States have already caused considerable disputes over the voting rights and the issue of Poland's attendance. When the conference is held in the future, the arena will be full of competition, which is to be expected. As for the other small countries, they are mostly raised by Britain and the United States to enhance their momentum. In fact, they cannot immediately control the conference. Moreover, since the death of Roosevelt, although the successor to the foreign policy has declared that it will remain the same, the urgency and priority will be different from before, and the strength and weakness will also be different. In the previous conference, the focus was on Roosevelt, which is undoubtedly the case. Now that the candidates have been decided, who will be the leader will definitely require more twists and turns. In short, since the old world order can no longer be maintained and the war in the East and West Oceans has occurred, it is necessary to establish a new mechanism for maintaining peace in international affairs. The East Asian people love peace very much, but the peace they love is a truly and permanently lasting peace. The results of the San Francisco Conference are still likely to repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations. It is clearly obvious that it cannot establish a permanent peace mechanism to ensure international security. On the 23rd of this month, the allied country Japan convened the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference in Tokyo in order to eliminate the ambition of Britain and the United States to dominate the world and to complete the independence and liberation of the Greater East Asia countries. The conference proposed to establish the foundation of a new international mechanism for a new world order based on the principles of political equality, economic reciprocity, and respect for inherent culture and elimination of racial discrimination, which should be unanimously supported by the Greater East Asia countries. Since our country is established in East Asia, we should be resolute and strong, uphold our aspirations, and strive to achieve a reasonable and permanent peace in the world under the victory of the war. The San Francisco Conference is not yet sufficient to talk about this.</p>

These delegates represent 46 countries. 18 other countries were not invited because they did not meet the qualifications for invitation, as they did not declare war on the Axis powers in accordance with the Yalta Conference and did not sign the United Nations Declaration. All delegates and local envoys stationed in various countries participated in the memorial service for Roosevelt. The Honduran Foreign Minister proposed that the San Francisco Conference should be renamed the Roosevelt Conference to express respect for the deceased US President.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Three Countries Exchange Views</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports from Washington: The foreign ministers of the UK, US, and USSR held a meeting at the US Department of State yesterday.

As the San Francisco Conference is about to open, there is no doubt that the three countries exchanged views on the issues that have arisen since the Crimean Conference, particularly the Polish issue, which seemed to be the focus of discussion. The meeting is scheduled to continue today, but there is no confirmation as to whether the Chongqing representative will attend.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: The British delegation attending the San Francisco Conference includes three cabinet members, five deputy ministers, and three representatives each from the Conservative and Labour parties, and one each from the Liberal and National Liberal parties. Halifax is also a cabinet member, but he is attending this time in his capacity as an ambassador.</p>

<h3>Construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway: Engineering Office Established, Director Xu of the Construction Bureau Concurrently Serves as Director</h3>
<p>Municipal authorities, in light of the reduced number of train services, believe that although the city has ships and automobiles for external transportation, the shortage of fuel is causing a daily decline in transportation. Moreover, many of the highways connecting various counties have fallen into disrepair over the years and are not fully passable. Furthermore, at a time when the city is actively relocating its population, transportation is a priority. Therefore, after consulting with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was decided to jointly undertake the construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway to ensure smooth passage. The plan has already been fully prepared. The city has established the Shanghai Special Municipality Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Engineering Office, with Director Xu of the Construction Bureau serving concurrently as director. Preparations are actively underway, and the office will soon begin operations.</p>
<p>Two Bridges on the Suzhou Creek Reopened</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek West Xizang Road Bridge and Fujian Road Bridge, which had been closed by the Municipal Construction Bureau, have not yet been reopened. In order to improve traffic flow in the city, the bureau has repaired them, and they have now been fully completed. They will be reopened today (the 25th) to facilitate pedestrians. Only pedestrians are allowed to use the two bridges; vehicles are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Bicycle Registration Deadline Approaching</p>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau has decided to close the registration for this year's bicycle licenses at the end of this month. Citizens who own bicycles are urged to apply for registration as soon as possible within the specified period. Those who fail to register in accordance with the regulations by the deadline will be fined 500 yuan according to regulations upon discovery.</p>
<p>Changes to Fees for Loading and Unloading Materials</p>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau has determined that the current license fees for loading and unloading materials at the city's public docks are no longer in line with actual costs. Therefore, the regulations have been changed and approved by the municipal government. Effective immediately, each license will be charged 100 yuan in national currency. Merchants in the city who load and unload materials at municipal docks must comply with the regulations and pay the fees.</p>

<h3>Call for Citizens to Cooperate in Air Defense: Prevent Light from Leaking Outwards, Statement from Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>The city's air defense authorities, recognizing that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage and the danger of air raids is unavoidable, and that enemy aircraft have repeatedly raided Shanghai, believe that strengthening air defense is an urgent priority. Citizens should also make every effort to cooperate in air defense tasks. However, it has been observed that citizens' air defense equipment is not perfect. In the past, electric lights mostly had air defense lampshades, but as the power company has adjusted the use of electricity in order to conserve power, citizens have switched to using kerosene lamps or candles after 10 PM each night. These oil lamps and candles do not have air defense covers, which often leads to light leakage, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, citizens are urged to be careful to prevent light from leaking outwards when using various types of lighting and to take appropriate measures. Not only should lights be turned off after hearing an air raid alarm, but also light must not leak outwards after dark at all times, as enemy aircraft may raid Shanghai at any time. Otherwise, once discovered by police officers, it will be treated as a violation of lighting control and punished severely according to regulations.</p>
<p>Statement from Air Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>The Air Defense Headquarters also issued a statement saying: "In this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the danger of air raids in the city is absolutely unavoidable. Citizens are often indifferent, and even harbor the despicable idea that the former concessions were 'safe areas,' so that they show no sense of urgency when encountering air raids and even adopt a detached attitude. Even if they reluctantly take shelter for air defense or cover the lights, it is only out of fear of punishment and is a perfunctory response, not an automatic action from within. They only seek to avoid being noticed, and during the day they may freely look up at the sky and watch the planes, and at night they have no qualms about turning on the lights, completely ignoring whether our actions or lights are being observed from above. It should be known that this behavior is extremely dangerous, not only related to the safety of individuals and their families, but also to the safety of neighbors and the entire city. Therefore, these people deserve harsh criticism and can be described as 'pests of air defense,' who are rejected by all citizens. Therefore, we must not only examine whether we have fulfilled our personal and family air defense responsibilities, but also prevent others from being irresponsible in order to reduce the damage from air raids. Therefore, we must absolutely pay attention to the following: first, during air raids, whether day or night, we must enter air raid shelters in an orderly manner and not watch on the roads; second, during air raids at night, we must not turn on lights or other lamps, and absolutely avoid light leakage to prevent unnecessary sacrifices."</p>

<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Revises Regulations on Business Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau is levying this year's spring business tax in accordance with the provisions and tax rates in the "Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax," as revised on October 5th of the 32nd year of the Republic. Now, the bureau believes that many of the regulations are no longer suitable for the current situation, and has revised Article 6, Article 10 (the tax on capital has been raised by one level), Article 12, Article 23, Article 24, Article 27, Article 28, Article 29, and Article 35, and has submitted them to the municipal government for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for approval and to the Executive Yuan for record. In accordance with Article 11 of the regulations, "for business types not listed in the tax rate table but meeting the nature of business tax collection," a supplementary tax type table has been prepared based on the types of businesses in Shanghai and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and record. It is understood that the supplementary tax type table will be retroactively levied as soon as it is approved by the authorities. The revised regulations have been decided to be formally implemented starting this summer (i.e., April, May, and June). The regulations are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Chapter I: General Provisions</p>
<p>Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with the provisions of the Business Tax Law, taking into account the nature and conditions of business in the city.</p>
<p>Article 2: All businesses operating in the city, except for factories that have paid factory tax to the central government or banks organized as joint-stock companies that have paid income tax, and those that have paid local taxes in the city, shall pay business tax in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.</p>
<p>Article 3: Business tax is levied on enterprises operating for profit, but agriculture is exempt. The foregoing provisions are limited to those with fixed business premises and manufacturing sites and shall not be levied on goods.</p>
<p>Article 4: The tax base for business tax collection in the city is temporarily limited to two types: total business revenue and business capital. The calculation of the total business revenue mentioned above shall be based on the total revenue for each quarter, and the calculation of the business capital shall be based on the actual capital used for business. Accumulated funds, etc., should be considered as capital. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Construction of the Greater East Asia Ethnic Group's Ideal World Order: Director Matsudaira's Reflections on the Ambassadors' Conference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japan Embassy held a routine press conference yesterday afternoon. Director Matsudaira of the Information Department expressed his reflections on the joint statement issued by the Ambassadors' Conference of the Greater East Asia nations, as follows:</p>
<p>Ideal World Order</p>
<p>The joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference discloses to the world everything that we Asians have wanted to say but dared not say for many years. I feel like a bird in a cage that has flown into the vast sky, and the darkness that remained in my mind has disappeared in an instant. The enemy, Britain and the United States, felt very threatened by the Greater East Asia Declaration in November of the previous year, fearing that the self-determination of the Greater East Asia people would be too fast. Therefore, they immediately held the Cairo Conference, dragging the Chongqing regime into their camp and creating an atmosphere of liberation for the Asian people. Subsequently, they went a step further, planning to create a world based on Britain and the United States, forcibly incorporating Asia into this world. The United States also fabricated an international organization plan with itself as the center, which it will force all countries to recognize at the San Francisco Conference, regardless of everything. However, the world order that the Greater East Asia countries have envisioned is completely different from the world order based on Britain and the United States, as compared in the following points:</p>
<p>British and American Concepts Put the Cart Before the Horse</p>
<p>Britain and the United States do not investigate the reasons for the outbreak of World War II, and only want to stop the war and establish peace. This is their fundamental shortcoming. The cause of this war is that Britain and the United States wanted to block the development opportunities of the Japanese, German, and Italian nations and artificially prevent their progress. On this point, the seventh item of the joint statement issued by the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference says: "Regarding the security guarantee mechanism, it is necessary to avoid the unilateral decision of the great powers and the unified method of the world, and to establish a security guarantee system that is suitable for the actual situation in the region, so that various world security mechanisms can be used together, and to adapt to the constantly evolving world situation, opening up the path for international order to change to peace." However, the Dumbarton Oaks international organization plan does not have this fundamental concept. It is like treating a disease without using a scalpel to remove the source of the disease, which is putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Fundamental Concept of World Order</p>
<p>The fundamental concept of world order should be to seek happiness for all mankind. The three words "clothing, food, and housing" are not the only concern, but all mankind should also be satisfied in all aspects such as knowledge and thought. In other words, international equality is the fundamental concept. Therefore, we advocate that regardless of the size of the country, it must obtain political equality, economic protection, and respect for its inherent culture. However, what is expressed in the British and American international organization plan is completely the opposite. The great powers want to dominate the small countries, and the strong prey on the weak. The so-called international equality is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Exploit Various Colonies</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have always prided themselves on their countries because they have colonies to exploit. They use the sacrifices of the inhabitants of the colonies as their own exclusive enjoyment. In the future, they will use what they have squeezed from their own colonies to complete their post-war domestic reconstruction. Therefore, there are no regulations on colonies in their international organization plan. Before the San Francisco Conference, the United States stated that it was unwilling to discuss this issue, secretly still wanting to maintain the status quo of the colonies. The third item of the joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference says: "Liberate all ethnic groups in colonial status, so that each can contribute to the advancement of human civilization." By comparing this with the thinking of Britain and the United States, it is clear how self-serving their claims are and how they disregard the happiness of other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Building a Truly Ideal Order</p>
<p>In short, the enormous sacrifices made by the nations of the world in order to complete this war must be for the sake of the evolution and development of mankind. This is something that British and American politicians have no trace of self-determination for. Disregarding the construction of an ideal world order, Britain and the United States still want to build a self-serving world order based on Britain and the United States. In order to smash such an unreasonable world order, we should continue to work hard, based on the spirit of international equality, and use the practical expression of blood and sweat to make Britain and the United States recognize our ideals.</p>
<h3>The Yang Changkang and Changxian Brothers Diligently Raise Significant Funds for Charitable Aid</h3>
<p>Yang Changkang and Changxian are brothers from the Hongfa Jixiang Company. They are usually dedicated to charity, sparing no effort. Last year, when the Shanghai Home for the Aged was raising funds, Mr. Yang actively promoted and solicited donations. Moreover, in previous charity drives and various social causes sponsored by this newspaper, they generously contributed and took the lead in initiating support. Recently, they made an even grander vow to extensively provide convenience by raising a significant sum of three million five hundred thousand yuan. They delivered this to our offices, entrusting us to forward it to various charitable organizations. The Yang brothers' dedication to public service, righteousness, and courageous charitable acts is truly exemplary for society. We are recording their original letter as follows:</p>
<p>"Respected Sirs, my brother Changxian and I have raised donations totaling exactly three million five hundred thousand yuan. We are now sending an immediate check, respectfully requesting that you distribute it to the following charitable organizations to cover their expenses, and please publish the titles of the donors in your esteemed newspaper to ensure credibility.

<p>"A list of the donors' titles is attached on the left."</p>

Respectfully, Yang Changkang and Yang Changxian."</p>
<p>(Note from this publication: We hope that all the charitable organizations listed above will provide official receipts for collecting the funds at our office.)</p>
<h3>Children's Savings Donated to Charity School Fund</h3>
<p>A statement from the Student Self-Government Association of the Workers' Children School of the French Electric and Water Company: "We, students of our school, are deeply moved by your newspaper's establishment of charity schools. However, although we have a warm heart, most of our parents are impoverished workers. It is already difficult for us to continue our studies, let alone have surplus funds to express our enthusiastic hearts. However, for the sake of our country's future, we must save some money, even in hardship, to fulfill our responsibilities as children. Enclosed are various old textbooks and a donation of 8,680 yuan. Please acknowledge receipt. In addition, Ding Feiying, a student in the first grade, has donated 2,000 yuan individually, while students Lu Yongxiang and Wu Genbao each donated 500 yuan, setting an example for all students."</p>
<h3>Grand Performance of Prizes in the Wanshang Hall - Significant Funds Donated to the Home for the Aged</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Li Ze, General Manager of the Xin Xin Company, sent a letter stating: "On the anniversary of the Xin Du Hotel's Wanshang Hall, various manufacturers generously donated valuable products for a prize drawing, which greatly aroused the interest of customers. Furthermore, the winning customers enthusiastically embraced public welfare, selling their prize winnings on the spot to support charitable causes. In addition to several instances where the proceeds from the charity sales were designated for the student aid funds of both Shen Bao and Xin Qin newspapers, last night, at the evening market, customer Mr. He Jialiang won the grand prize: a case of Benevolentor wine. He immediately put it up for charity sale, and it was purchased by Mr. Lu Zanming for 300,000 yuan. Subsequently, Mr. Lu resold the wine for charity, and it was purchased by Mr. Luo Mingshan for 100,000 yuan. A total of 400,000 yuan was raised from the charity sales. It is evident that the three gentlemen, He, Lu, and Luo, never forget to do good deeds, which is truly admirable. Our company, following the example of these gentlemen, has added 100,000 yuan, bringing the total to 500,000 yuan. We are sending this letter along with the donation to your newspaper, requesting that it be forwarded to the Home for the Aged to help with their expenses. We also hope that you will publish the charitable deeds of He, Lu, and Luo in your newspaper and the News Daily to encourage others."</p>
<p>Charity Performance by the Pude Society: The Shanghai Pude Society, in order to raise funds for providing medical consultations, medicine distribution, and charity school expenses, has specially requested the participation of movie and drama stars to hold a charity performance of dramas and songs.
