<p>社評</p>
<h3>維持社會秩序　讀蔣代表吳副市長談話書感</h3>
<p>自日本接收波次坦宣言，表面願意無條件投降以來，我全國同胞，以八年來之抗戰目的，業巳最後實現，莫不歡躍振奮。尤共淪陷區同胞，久陷於黑暗苦難之中，一旦重見光明，　結情緒，從此弛解，更不能自禁其手舞足蹈。</p>
<p>然而，在此日軍雖巳投降而尙未完全解除武裝；中央勝利但尙未正式接收淪陷城市政權之過渡期間，凡吾國民，猶須特別警戒自重，以防因愛國之動機，而犯誤國之過錯。即中央方面各機關各負責人員巳蒞淪陷區者，在此時期，尤當爲國民之楷式，以維持社會秩序，指導民衆正常生活爲首務，對於所屬工作人員之行動，尤須以嚴格之紀律約束，俾使淪陷區同胞目擊心折，從而對中央政府及其所屬，油然而生由衷的感激；更從而對中央大員發生摯誠的愛戴與擁護。然後一切大政乃可逐步順利推進，推一地方一城市而至全部淪陷區，莫不如此，是則不僅奸詐之徒無可遁跡，即聯合各國對我之觀感，亦必更增其尊重之程度。</p>
<p>就本市的實際動態而言，旬餘以來，率直言之，尙有若干現象，不能不使有心人士惄焉憂之。惟以上海情形之複雜，環境之特殊，幸尙未有嚴重事熊發生者，我們不能不感佩中央特派大員的賢明領導及堅苦奮　。茲讀蔣委員長代表蔣伯誠先生及上海市副市長吳紹澍先生發表談話，更增我們的欽敬與感戴之　。</p>
<p>蔣代表以軍事時期業巳結束，一切行動須循正軌。吳副市長首先勸吿市民遵照蔣主席昭示，對於日本軍民，消除敵對心理，實爲大國民應有之態度，亦爲今日維持秩序之要着。其次，吳副市長吿誡各方，對於奸逆之懲治，國有常典，斷不容自由行動，即檢舉，偵査，審訊，判决，亦有一定程序。同時更須斟酌罪惡輕重，功過相當，不能輕率措置。對於逆產亦當依照法律辦理，不得任意處分。凡此皆爲維持社會秩序所必要。否則，各機關及個人自由行動，結果反足使眞奸逆得以再度投機，而社會上不免流行惶恐心理。吳副市長更盼在滬各機關各代表均能遵照軍委會委員長代表蔣伯誠先生之意旨，速往代表公署登記，俾免冒混，而一步趨。對於接收機關學校團體等應候中央統一處理，凡此又爲今日防範奸究冒混，安定人心維持社會秩序的根本方針。</p>
<p>我們慶幸蔣代表及吳副市長的賢明與適時的指示，我們更深盼全市各界善體蔣吳兩氏的意旨，上下協力，維持地方秩序，迎接中央政府復都及最後勝利慶祝之日，更準備集中全市民力量，以謀大上海市之新生建設。</p>
<h3>日近海發生颶風　登陸須延緩兩天　九月一日盟軍進駐九州</h3>
<p>中央社馬尼刺二十五日電　麥克沃塞總部宣布，琉球列島與日本間，連續爲颶風所襲，登陸行動，不得不延緩四十八小時，希望屆時風力與海浪能減少，至容　登陸程度，投降　將改在九月二日舉行。</p>
<p>中央社馬尼刺二十五日電　麥克沃塞元帥總部本日宣布，前爲日本投降所定一切計劃，因颶風之故，特展期四十八小時。按同盟國家巳通知日本，盟方在登陸時之一切意向及希望日本應供給之種種物資，然佔領計劃之其他各部份，仍屬機密，一如戰時之作戰行動，運兵船將在第三艦隊掩護之下，前往東京，俟登陸一旦開始，所載美海軍陸戰隊，即在東京區登陸，東京灣內佔領軍之第一目標，自屬橫須賀海軍基地。美海軍專家屆時將檢勘該基地之秘密。</p>
<p>中央社重慶二十五日電　據東京電台廣播福岡訊，西部軍管區司令部發表公報稱：九州區域盟國佔領軍，將於九月一日上午十時左右開始登陸，其先頭部隊飛機二架，將在鹿兒島對縣之鹿屋機塲降落。盟方佔領軍空運部隊，將降落鹿屋機塲，盟軍海面船艦，將開始運送部隊在高須附近登陸，佔領軍之行動時，限制於鹿屋高須一帶。</p>
<h3>各國代表團　即赴東京灣　參加投降者簽字</h3>
<p>中央社馬尼刺二十四日電　我國代表團，定二十五日與其他各國代表團搭船離馬尼刺駛東京灣，參加簽訂日本投降協定，麥克沃塞元帥將稍後乘機前往，戰地記者約九十人，將搭機離此往琉球，再往東京。麥帥參謀本部之軍官逾一百人，亦將於同日搭機離此，總部爲獲得充分座位起見，現今儘量使用各長距離飛機，包括B24式轟炸機，並作稱種努力，使新聞記者能自厚木機塲發出此歷史性之消息。因日本電　設備之不適切，故凡有關簽訂投降協定之新聞，將用專機携往琉球，然後轉發世界各地，但希望於投降協定簽訂後二三日內，能自日本直接發出新聞電。</p>
<h3>日政府要求　派記者參加</h3>
<p>中央社重慶二十五日電　據美新聞處馬尼刺二十四日電，日本政府本日要求麥克沃塞元帥，准許日本記者及新聞照片與影片攝影員，在正式投降典禮及盟軍登陸日本時，拍攝照片與影片。此等記者與攝影員，在鹿屋方面之記者大約有二十五人在厚木·橫須賀以及美戰鬥艦上燈塲合，大約有四十人。</p>
<h3>寺內決派沼田　赴明加拉頓　昨晨對德里電台聲明</h3>

<p>中央社緬境隨軍路透社記者二十四日電　阿布亞英高級軍官，今日下午會在一小木屋中接見日本特別使節，小木屋在西湯河以東數英里，會議歷二小時，會後公佈之聲明稱，雙方認爲，在「停火」至東京區實際簽定降書期間，不必再行流血。</p>

<h3>麥克沃塞警吿　日機勿飛行</h3>
<p>中央社重慶二十五日電　據美新聞處馬尼刺二十四日電，麥克沃塞元帥本日指示日木帝國大本營，關於日空軍之處理，麥帥警吿日大本營稱，日機如未奉命，不論在何地起飛，將遭美機追擊，各日機勿以任何方式飛行，否則視爲威脅佔領軍。</p>
<h3>蘇軍準備佔領　日北島及海道　日認爲非常遺憾</h3>
<p>中央社舊金山二十五日合衆電　東京廣播稱，據莫斯科電台報告，蘇空運部隊現準備佔領日本最北島嶼及海道，日政府致麥帥電日：「如該報告屬實，則日本政府認爲非常遺憾。日本現正努力實踐閣下之要求，而將陸海軍及平民置於嚴格管制之下，日本人民僉望盟國軍隊將按照規定開入日本」</p>
<h3>大批日人　集體切腹</h3>
<p>舊金山二十五日合衆電　據此間截得東京廣播稱。大批日人今日　集皇宮堦前，集體切腹。該廣播報吿因盟軍登陸日期，爲期巳迫，大批日人咸切腹自殺。據東京某評論家謂，此種日本傳統之自殺精神，絕非歐美盟國所能理解，日本民族特具敏感，作戰期內咸均全力以赴，然而時至今日，交通阻梗，屋舍漏雨，戰敗之苦備　之矣，一種悲忿之情難以言傳。自陸相及海軍軍令部長自殺之後，切腹之風業巳彌漫扶桑三島矣。</p>
<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>青浦縣金澤鎭</h3>
<p>— 秬嘉</p>
<p>從上海乘汽車由青滬公路到青浦，改乘汽船至朱家角，再乘划船或航船，即可至金澤鎭。是一個人口約在一萬左右的市鎭。</p>
<p>地勢與交通</p>
<p>金澤鎭北臨　山湖，東接蓮湖，西與南也有很大的湖泊，是四面環水的一個市鎭，與商塔，西岑合併爲金·商·西三鎭，是青浦縣內最西的市鎭，又與吳江縣及浙江嘉善縣相接，故也是江浙兩省交界處的一個市鎭。</p>
<p>交通因四周都爲大湖所圍繞，所以與各地往來是非船不可通行的，在事變前，往來各地的汽船有松金綫；是從該鎭至松江的航綫，此外有上海至北庫的上北綫，朱家角至嘉善的朱禾綫，也都由該鎭經過的，在事變後，雖經數次的恢復，但終因治安的不健全，往往有被刦等情發生，故巳全部停止航行，而都由划船及航船來代替了。至於現在通航的有：東至靑浦·朱家角而到上海，南至章練塘·松江等地，西至盧墟·吳江等地，北至蘇州等地。但時常有搶刦或提差等事而停駛。</p>
<p>郵政有朱家角郵局所管的代辦處，但因郵件時有延擱，故與有船隻往來的地方，都托航船或划船來代送了</p>
<p>市容與治安</p>
<p>該鎭雖未受戰爭的影響，但地屬鄉僻之區，又因交通的不便利，常爲土匪所聲垣，經寇盜的數次侵犯及騷擾後，除一部份之房屋尙存外，其他如鬧市中心都化爲瓦燦塲所，現在雖造些小屋來開市，但總不及以前的繁榮了。</p>
<p>商業方面，都以農作物與日用品的交換爲中心，對於製造業方面是不發達的，現雖有油坊，糟坊等數家，但其出品尙不夠自足，而其他如日用品等物，都仰於朱家角及西塘蘇州等地所供給。今年五月間，各地軍糧尙未結束以前，該鎭早巳結束，故販戶都以此處爲交易塲所，一時米行，碾米廠及小米店櫛比皆是，其商業的興盛，高於其他各地。</p>
<p>至於洽安，可以說是靑浦縣內最不良好的市鎭，今天某某軍來，明天某某軍去，鬧得不亦樂乎，那末什麼捐，什麼稅，也跟着的强迫徵收，一般貪官汚吏也混在其間飽了他的私囊，使市民都入於敢怒而不敢言的境况。所以現正希望着當局即速來取締這種不法之徒，方可使市民入於安居樂業的境況。</p>
<p>物產與民風</p>
<p>產以農作物爲最，米·麥·豆·瓜·蔬菜等類的產量很大，足可以供給當地而有餘，又因多於河流及湖泊的緣故，所以水產物也極豐富，如魚·蝦·蟹·黃鱔·鰻魚·甲魚等的產量，都高於靑浦縣的其他各地，專靠漁業而生的漁民也極衆，此外如狀元糕當地的特產，駛名於江南各地，但近因糖價飛漲，不免有些偸工減料等情形發生，故其味亦不及以往矣。現秋令巳至，菱的產量也很多。</p>
<p>該鎭住民，都信佛敎，每年於陰曆三月廿七日及九月九日重陽節，向有迎神賽會的習俗，在這幾天內，各地小阪都集中於此，各地善男信女來進香也極夥，遠自上海，江北等地都有香客來此進香拜佛，一時的盛况與江灣的迎神賽會差不多。</p>
<p>敎育與宗敎</p>
<p>該鎭敎育在事變前有縣立小學校定，至今只有縣立小學校一所，收納學生三百餘人，但其中的敎員程度太淺，往往有小學未畢業者，也在交　，其學生水準的低落，亦可想而知。至於中學校是沒有的，如欲求學者，非至他埠是不可的。</p>
<p>該鎭的寺廟很多，相傳從前此地有很多的官是要產生的，後經某人的破法，所以增加了許多的陰官。其中以頤浩寺（俗名大寺）爲最大，相傳會建於明朝以前，且能與杭州之淨寺靈云寺相平等，但因受數次的火災後，現只剩一山門及災後新建的數間小屋，觀後不免有些滄海淒然之慨。</p>
<p>商塔與西岑</p>
<p>商塔是離金澤十餘里許在　山湖畔的一個次於金澤的市鎭，鎭內商業發達，但因地處荒野，易於匪徒的出入，鎭上一般名家富商，都逃往他鄉，故現商業零落，市容巳遠不極前。</p>
<p>西岺在金澤東六里，朱家角西十八里，是比鄉村稍大的一個小鎮，鎭內的商店，至多不過數十家，而且都是資本極少的，故商業的交易數量也不大，每日上午，全鎭充滿了鄉下人，茶　酒館吵擾不停，眞是一個鄉下人的消　地點。</p>

<h3>國防中常聯席會議　蔣主席訓辭全文　（完續）</h3>
<p>東亞民族相互友愛</p>
<p>我在這裏要告訴我門實現民族主義的三個主要原則；第一，我們中國政府和人民，必須懐抱極高的精誠與堅定的決心，絕不効法日本對待高麗的行徑。凡對於持有自治能力與獨立精神的民族，必須精誠相愛，扶持其長成，使之遠成自主和獨立的目的。我們必須一反日本帝國主義之所爲，使東亞大陸，在乎我反侵略戰爭全面曙光之中，樹立民族自主和自由平等的基礎。五十年來，我們中國國民黨國民革命，推翻滿淸，反抗日本，不僅爲中國本身自由平等而奮鬥，亦且爲高麗的解放獨立而奮鬥。今日以後，我們更須本同樣的宗旨，與一切有關的盟邦，共同尊重民族獨立平等的原則，永遠保障他們應該獲得的地位。第二，在省區以外的民族，具備自治能力與有獨立意志，而在經濟政治上，達到了可以獨立的程度之時，我們的國家對他們必以親愛友好的態度和精神，自動的扶助他們獨立自由，永久視爲中國平等的兄弟之邦，不因其離間祖國而發生惡感或歧視，而我們各民族亦必須對其祖國以和睦親義的態度，循合法的程序提出願望，以達成其目的，不可採取反抗祖國的行動，以引起民族間互相的仇恨。第三，各省區以內的大小民族，在政治上和法律上，一律予以平等，信仰上和經濟上，亦予以充份自由，而不加以干涉，以達成我們各宗族間精誠團結，友愛互助之目的。</p>
<p>扶助西藏　政治發展</p>
<p>西藏民族的政治地位，在第六次全國代表大會，本巳決定予以高度的自治，扶助其政治之進步，與民生之康樂。我可以負責聲明，如果西藏民族此時提出自知的願望，我們政府亦必本我一貫之眞誠，賦予高度自治，如果他們將來在經濟條件上，能够達到獨立自主的時候，我們政府亦將與對外蒙古一樣，扶持其獨立，但必須西藏能鞏固其本身永遠獨立的地位，不致蹈擊高麗過去的覆轍。</p>
<p>外蒙西藏問題的解決，乃是我們國民革命重大的任務，也是民族主義實現的階模，我們必須負起全　來解決這個問題，希望我全國同胞，亦本着我們國革命的原則，和民族主義的精神，協助政府來解決這個問題，使其得到圓滿的結果。爲了世界和平與安全，爲了國家鞏固與建設，我們對於於全世界民旅問題的主張，必須依據大西洋　章與三民主義的精神，來求得解決。</p>
<p>對泰越緬</p>
<p>表示願望至此我對於我們中國西南邊　上個幾個民族問題，也是以世界和平與安全的關係，不能不表示我們中國的願望：第一，緬甸民族與中國之歷史關係甚深，我們中國在抗戰期間，兩度派兵入緬作戰，我們遠征軍將士，直接間接傷亡的數目，共在二十萬人以上，而僑民之損失尙不可數。但是我們尊重盟邦主權，恪守國際信義，我軍在緬甸戰塲的任務一經完成，立即撤回本國，我們視此乃是我們聯盟國一份子應盡之義務，決無其他企求。但希望我盟邦對緬甸民族的政治地位，應積極加以改良而予以提高，其對我在緬甸華僑復歸就業，予以迅速而有效之扶助。第二，泰國民族與中國的關係，較其他尤爲深切普遍，我們中國是與泰國作戰而首受影響的國家，故泰個未來劃入中國戰區，中國自無異議。我們始終認爲泰國對我聯合國宣戰，是出於被動，純由於日本帝國主義的脅迫，因此我們希望望泰國，在戰後仍恢復其固有的獨立和平等地位，尤希望與中國迅速建立正常之國際友好關係。第三，安南民族，中國在抗戰期間，因安南政府不能自保其主權，幷供日本以侵華基地，因之中國的生命財產，皆受鉅大的損失。但是我們今日爲了恪守同盟國的協定，派遣軍隊接受北緯十六度以北地區的日軍投降之外，對於越南決沒有領土的企圖。我們的希望望：是越南民族能從自治以漸臻於獨立，以實現大西洋　章的規定。</p>
<p>香港地位　外交解決</p>
<p>再後我們要提到香港問題，香港乃廣東之安危與共的鄰封，太平洋戰爭爆發以後，乃劃入中國戰區，今當日本帝國主義無條件投降之際，我們中國決不藉招降的機會，忽視國際合作和盟邦的主權。所以我們不願派兵接收香港，引起盟邦間誤會。但我可以對世界與全國國民負責的聲明：關於香港的地位，從前是以中英兩國條約爲根據，今後要由所改正，亦當依照中英兩國友好的協商關係而建立。我們的外交方針和國際政策，主張尊重條約，根據法律，以及時代要求與實際需要，而求得合理的解決。現在中國全國各租借地，經次第收　，九龍的租借條約自非例外，但是我們中國亦必從兩國外交及條約的途徑，以期解決此最後未了的一個問題。</p>
<p>勗勉團結　致力復興</p>
<p>總之，這次世界大戰，是人類史上空前的戰爭，今日，聯合各盟邦無不希望這空前的戰爭成爲最後的戰爭。我們中國抗戰的時日最久，受禍亦最慘，所以希望和平亦最爲迫切。凡足以促進國內團結及國際和平者，我們必盡力促其實現，我們必與我全世界盟邦共同奮鬥到底，以建立全世界一切民族國家獨立自由的友好關係，維護一切人類精神，與物賀上由互助而建立的永久和平生活，不使世界上再有強權政治的發現，更不令全世界一切民族再受不平等·不自由以及一切　乏與恐怖的痛苦。在這意義上，我以爲民族平等和國家獨立的原則之實現，最爲當務之急。國民政府必本於中國立國忠孝仁愛信義和平的一　精神，與國民革命一貫的國策，乘此世界和平曙光初啟之際，使民族主義見諸實施，此吾人平生之心願，當爲世界友邦所共諒。這實在是建立世界和平與中國安定的保障，務望我全國同胞同心一德，協力一致以赴之，則民族復興，建國完成，庶可計日而待，而對我八年抗戰所犧牲的千百萬軍民同胞之英靈，亦可吿慰而無遣憾。第一次世界大戰以來，我國父孫先生所乘訓於吾人，勸勉於世界之格言，亦由此而得所成就了。</p>

<h3>德科學家技術員　供美國利用</h3>

<h3>美海軍力量　爲擊敗日本之原動力</h3>
<p>中央社紐約二十五日電　紐約報昨日社評中著稱：「無論日本方面如何堅持其所以戰敗者乃由於原子炸彈所致，而我國海軍力量實爲戰敗日本之一大原動力，已無可　言」。該報復稱：「於第一隻原子炸彈在廣島上空爆炸之前，日本方面之作戰力量巳損失殆盡，當彼等失去制海權時，日本在本土與西太平洋控制能力之消失，早巳迫近眉睫。美國之海軍力量與制空權，促使美國能早日獲得勝利，在歷史上無其他國家似此次戰爭中日本在海上所遭受之慘敗，日本十二艘戰艦中僅存一艘，破毀而無海員，二百零二艘輸送艦中僅存四艘，破毀而無海員，十九艘　重巡洋艦中僅存二艘，及後該僅存之二重巡洋艦又遭擊毀，二十艘輕巡洋艦中無有一艘存在，一百五十六艘驅遂艦中僅存二十六艘，一百四十六艘潛艇中僅存二十二艘」。該報復將日本之海上損失與美國常局在五月三十一日所發表之海上損失比較，戰艦「阿里査那」號一艘，巨大運輸艦五艘，小型遝輸艦六艘，重巡洋艦六艘，輕巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦六十艘，潛水艇四十三艘，然美國之艦船損失均由努力之新建造而彌補完整。而日本在一九四一年十二月七日至一九四五年八月十八日止，其問新建造之艦船寥寥無幾，故所謂原子炸彈者，僅爲一改變戰爭與防禦戰術觀念之革命而巳，此項炸彈僅將現世界上所應於用陸·海·空方面之一切武器顯示出腐化無能。故我人應明瞭，此次作戰中，海上力最實爲摧殘敵人之主力，大西洋中如此，太平洋中亦如此，海上力量包括導進戰事進展及佔領海岸之空輸力量，共同築成一條强有力之供應綠，甚至最先運載第一隻原子炸彈及其他農置物至塞班島，亦爲一「印第安納波利斯」號之巡洋艦</p>

<h3>何宣導委員招待各界　報告宣導工作經過</h3>
<p>軍事委員會宣導委員何民魂氏，昨（廿五）日下午假座美華酒家招待本市父老及各界領袖，到丁福保·　延芳·榮鴻元·李登輝·沈叔玉·金宗城·吳蘊　·蔣竹莊·顏惠慶·桂崇基·楊允中·徐寄　·秦潤卿·袁覆登·郭順·林康侯·王伯元·朱吟江·蔡聲白·項康原·馮炳南·方椒伯·趙晋卿·王松濤，孫恩霖·葛家良·馮樹華等六十餘人。席間由何委員報告軍委會宣導委員會的組織與工作，設委員九人，分東北·華北·東南三區，本人員責東南地區。　說明兩點：</p>
<p>工作經過與自我檢討，前年冬天受命蔣委員長東歸，準備迎候國軍總反攻，因環境關係，不能公開工作，日本接受投降時，即赴京工作，一切尙稱順利，但上海方面，則因環境特殊，工作略不謹愼，即易引起誤會，回滬以後，即分別調整。　整個配合與精誠無間，今後上海辦公處由趙晋卿先生出任主任，當能與黨部精誠配合，並隨時請示於委座代表蔣伯誠先生，以推進工作。東南地區殷憂孔多，故宣導工作，未容忽視，將來國軍正式到達各地，秩序恢復，宣導工作，自然告一結束。現在日軍巳正式投降，巳非秘密工作時代，希望不必過分刺激他人，至於偽方人員問題，我等非審判官，不便多談云云。詞畢即由林康侯代表來賓答詞，說明民間的期望，即盡歡而散。</p>
<p>時局人物</p>
<h3>盡力維護上海治安</h3>
<p>— 方澄</p>
<p>——行動總隊程秘書長訪問記——</p>
<p>我們翻開本月二十一日及二十三一日的上海各報，在本埠版內看到：「上海行動總隊司令部發表重要人事」的消息。所謂重要人事的名單中，我們從頭到尾細細一數，似乎大部分是很熟見的幾位。可是，其中的秘書長兼軍法處長程克祥先生的大名，似乎初次見到。上海行動總隊司令，是奉蔣委員長電令設立，負責維持滬杭一帶治安，任務極為艱鉅。當此時局轉捩環境複雜之際，確保上海治安，極非易事，而克祥先生擔任司令部秘書長兼軍法處長職務，其在確保上海治安的工作中，無疑是負着極重要的責任。以這樣重要的職務，委之於很生疏的人，不免有些詫異，因爲中國官塲的習慣，秘書長一職總是長官的親信，我們以爲親信而是人才，當然無可非　，如果僅僅是安插親信，或者親信霸佔要津，那末，無論政治經濟的事業，前途必無光明可言了。</p>
<p>爲了當前和今後上海治安的重要性，市民們對於負責治安的上海行動總隊的工作，一定非常關心，同時，對於擔任重要職務的程克祥秘書長，存有一種極殷切的期待和疑慮。程氏是不是周佛海氏的親信？是因事擇人還是因人設事？程氏成爲與滬市治安有重要關係的時局人物了，因此，引起我們訪問的動機。</p>
<p>忘生死齊心志的奮鬥</p>
<p>在滬西的一角，很靜緻的環境中，記者到達了上海行動總隊司令部，遞了名片求見程秘書長，很快的由勤務引入，在一間佈置得非常簡單樸素整潔的辦公室中，迎面走出來一位，穿着軍服，精神奕奕的壯年，體格健碩，眉宇間露出清秀而又剛毅之氣，很熱烈地與記者握手，他就是我所想訪問的程克祥秘書長。</p>
<p>「程秘書長這幾天一定很忙吧，實在很冒昧地來打擾」·記者坐下開始寒暄了。「因爲環境非常複雜的上海，在平時維護治安巳經非易，而在目前這樣的非常又非常的局面中，　小匪類，伺機　動，維持治安，實在是最不容易的事」。程氏說話時語氣有力，態度沉靜，給予我一個極佳的</p>
<p>「可是，我們上受蔣委員長付託之重，下有滬市民衆期望之股，無論怎樣的艱難，我們必須齊心戮力，完成我們的任務，我個人早巳決定，貢獻我所有的精力智慮，爲志願而努力奮鬥，要排除艱阻，克服困難，惟有工作人員一體忘生死齊心志的奮鬥。所以，在這樣的志願之下，事務的忙是不言而喻的，而且是非忙不可的」。程氏繼續表示更堅强的工作態度。</p>
<p>「目前上海的治安任務，誠然艱巨異常，料必巳有周密的佈置。未知國軍何日到達，這是上海市民非常關心的問題」？記者插口說着。</p>
<p>「種種維持治安的措置，巳經有了極周密的佈置，工作同志，也能共體蔣委員長意旨，堅守本位工作。不過，治安是整個的是廣域的，只有軍警官方的努力，還是不够的，必須全體市民都瞭解自身地位對於治安關係的重要，希望市民人人嚴肅自己，檢點自己，從消極的不妨碍洽安進而做到積極的協力治安，這樣，上海的治安就沒有問題了。現在中央巳經明令指派湯恩伯將軍負責接收京滬兩地，國軍不久就可開到。不過，國軍開到當然可以增加治安的力量，但是，我們全體市民及優秀的工作同志，永遠是維護地方的主力，這是不可忽略的」。程氏進一步很嚴　的强調維護治安中市民應有的責任。</p>
<p>曲折驚險的奮鬥史</p>
<p>「我很冒昧我想知道一點程秘書長過去的經歷」。記者轉移話題，終於說出了個人以至一般人的疑問。程氏聽了我的問話，態度立刻轉變，露出藹然可親的笑容，兩手緊緊地合握着，仰面凝視着懸在壁間的蔣委員長的肖像，半　不語，經過一刻的沉默，又開始說道：</p>
<p>「我雖則是一個國民黨員，可是，我始終抱具以純粹人民的身份參加民族革命的鬥爭。如果說我的鬥爭歷史吧！不長也不短，巳經由十八九年了。從參加工人運動工作起，在這十八九年的過程中，如果把我的經歷細細的數說，或許可以請您寫成一部很曲折驚險的長篇小說。</p>
<p>「我到過各省各地，親近過各階層，上至達官顯宦，下至販夫走卒。因此，我能瞭解各階層的動向。我　過牢獄私刑，出生入死，恐怖艱險的生活，因此，我能體騐各組織的實况。因爲我實際參加二十年來的民族革命的鬥爭，養成了我的生活習慣，從　餓，困苦，貧乏中鍛鍊出嚴肅而簡單的生活，直到目前爲止，我還是習以爲常，安之若素。</p>
<p>「我雖然上無片瓦，下無寸土，可是，我有廣大的同志，我有豐富的友情，足以使我忘却了一切的磨折，而益發加强了奮鬥的意志」。程氏滔滔不絕地，有條不紊地說明他的奮鬥史，我聽了在直覺上心情上起着一種無限的欽敬。我們國家的終於重見光明，完全寄託在這一般有志有爲之士的身上，同時更使我感到慚愧無已。</p>
<p>廣大同志與豐富友悄</p>
<p>「這次參加上海行動總隊工作，完全以市民資格被選用的。我個人也想以一個人民和黨員的立塲，憑我過去奮鬥的經騐，貢默我所有的棉力，因此，我就參加了這次工作」。程氏接着說明這次參加工作的經過，我方始恍然中國政治界的習慣，秘書長總是長官的親信故　，也有例外的了。</p>
<p>「有人也許以爲我是一個革命鬥爭者，必然個性暴躁，不通世故的，其實，革命鬥爭是我的志願，我的個性自信是柔順的，因爲我信仰佛敎，對於過去的一切，都主張「寬大仁厚」。最後，程氏含笑的說明他的個性，這種坦白而親切的態度，更給予人們溫暖的感覺，所以他說「我有廣大的同志，我有　當的友情」。自非偶然了。</p>
<p>談到這裏，巳經躭擱了很多時間，記者起立吿辭，從另一方面，我們知道他是江西人，年約三十八九歲，眞是一位少壯的鬥士。</p>

<h3>矯正時弊</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>「戰爭期內，凡足以打擊敵人，或足以增加吾方力量之手段，當無所擇，尤其於戰事達於最後階段時，更所不免。」這是副市長吳紹　先生談話中的話。但現在敵人正式求和，戰爭結束，所以，吳先生更說，一部分工作，巳失存在意義。</p>
<p>「軍事時期，巳告結束，此後一切行動，均須遵循正軌，決不能如秘密活動時期之可以不擇手段。」這是委員畏代表蔣伯誠先生談話中的話。</p>
<p>蔣吳兩先生的談話，其主要意思當在維持上海秩序與維護中央威信。我們在最近旬日之間所見所聞，更覺蔣吳兩先生的談話，的確是針對時弊的良言。</p>
<p>蔣先生是委員長駐滬代表，吳先生是本市黨政負責者，他們所說的話，當然有此必須實施的決意與尊嚴。</p>
<h3>美國的報紙</h3>
<p>— 曉朝</p>
<p>美國最初出現的報紙，是一七〇四年八月在波士頓發行的週刋波士頓新聞報「Boston　news　lett　」，次於波士頓的，是一七一九年在費城出版的一種報紙。紐約最初出版的報紙是「紐約公報」（New　Yark　Gazette），至一七七三年而有「紐約日報」（New　York　journal）出版。國內戰爭，巳予新聞事　以顯著的刺激，使它不斷地進步，完成按　上的改　。最近，美國巳有定期刋物二萬種以上（其中　日出版的報紙二千五百種以上），印刷報　總份數約達二億二千萬份）其中每日出版的報紙總出版份數約三千三百萬份）。</p>
<p>定期出版業方而的投資額，佔美國產業總投資額中的第五位。美國的報紙，多數每天發行數次（目二次至五次），每份多　數十頁（約自六十頁至八十頁，星期日常　二百頁之多）。每份都有許多頁數爲廣吿所佔據，此外有長篇小說，有關於運動的詳細報告，並有許多插圖，畫報也非常流行，普通印刷份數常達一百萬份以上。</p>
<p>美國新聞業的「康采倫」（大獨佔機構）也是非常大規模的，主要的有如一八七八年開辦的「史克利普斯·哈華德」，係由E.V.史克利普斯集中了二十六家日報而成（包括「華爾德電訊報」·「克利夫蘭新聞報」·「匹茲堡新聞報」·「辛辛那提郵報」·「巴爾的摩爾郵報」·「舊金山新聞報」·「華盛頓新聞報」·「底特律新聞報」等），又如一八九五年設立的「哈斯特·康采倫」，擁有二十三家日報和八種星期刋（星期日出版），（包括有「紐約美利堅報」·「紐約日報」·「波士頓通報」·「波士頓美利堅報」·「芝加哥美利堅報」·「舊金山訊問報」·「華盛頓泰晤士報」·「巴爾的摩爾新聞報」等）。其他報紙聯合組織尙有C.HK.卡契斯，富蘭克E.加內特，詹姆斯，M.基雅斯等集團。</p>
<p>美國在各國及世界每一角落裏都派有通訊員的主要的通訊社之中，首推美國最大的電報通訊社「美聯社」（Associatedpress,簡稱A.P.）；創立於一九〇〇年，擁有多數出版社，一百五十處支分社，經常以世界每一角　提供新聞情報。此外尙有一九〇七年創立的「合衆社」（United　psess，簡稱U.P.），隸屬於上述史克利普斯·哈華德新聞聯合系統之下，擁有專用電報網。而哈斯特聯合則　屬有一九〇九年創立的「國新社」或「國際社」（International　news　service，簡稱I.N.S），　社不僅爲哈斯特系及其他本國報紙，並對英國各報社服務。</p>
<p>最暢銷的報紙美國要算是「每日新聞」，創立於一九二〇年，在紐約發行份數達一百三十萬份。至於美國最大的報紙，一爲「紐約泰　士報」，一八五一年創設，爲民主黨的機關報，發行份數約爲四十萬份。二爲「紐約先驅輪　報」，倸合併「先）與「論壇報」（一八四一年創辦）而於一九二四年創刋的，每日出一百至一百四十頁，爲共和黨的機關報，發行份數百二十九萬份。三爲芝加哥出版的「芝加哥每日諭　報」，始創於一八四七年，發行份數日約八十萬份。此外一八七七年創刋的「芝加哥每日新聞」日銷四十四萬份。「華爾德電訊報」係合併「電訊報」（一八六七年創刋）及「華爾德報」（一八六〇年創刋）而出版的，銷數二十三萬六千份，爲史克利普斯·哈華德系的主要報紙。「紐約晚郵報」於一八〇一年創刋，屬於卡契斯·馬丁系統，日銷十萬份（另有畫報「星期六晚郵」，銷數達二百萬份）。自一九四〇年起，紐約新出一種「P.M.報」（PostMeridian)即「下午報」，芝加哥市尙出版共產黨機關報「每日工人報」及共產青年同盟的機關報「年工人報」等。（譯自蘇聯出版「美利堅合衆國」一章）</p>

<h3>還我自由</h3>
<p>— 渟若</p>
<p>睽隔多年的自由談，巳隨和平以俱至，從自由談聯想到我人重獲的自由，眞是倍感親切。一時歡　，興奮而又欣慰。像沉船中被救出的乘容，重新覺得生命的安全。杜甫有詩曰：「劍外忽傳收蘇北，初聞涕淚滿衣裳」。寫他自己當時喜極淚下的情緒，今日誦之，眞絕無誇張之處。試想今後我人的生命財產，言論行動都巳獲得法律的保障，不會無端再受槍桿的恐嚇，全國乃至全世界祗要有能力，沒有不可去之處，夜行亦不致跌入「坑」中，物價也逐漸消滅了，「黑」「白」市的分別，這些　是往日「金錢」「勢力」所能幸致的？無形的桎梏巳從我人身上取去，仰觀晴空，浮雲欲笑，返顧人間，普天同慶。大地頓改　觀，今人自覺地年輕了若干歲，光明自由前程無限。</p>

<p>Zhijiang, 25th – Lieutenant General Leng Xin, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese Army Headquarters, is scheduled to lead 159 officers and soldiers on seven aircraft to Nanjing on the morning of the 26th to establish a forward command post. Special Correspondent Xu Hongqi of the Central News Agency will accompany them on the flight.

Mr. Leng and the first group of personnel are scheduled to fly there on the morning of the 28th. It is learned that after Imai returned to Nanjing to report, Okamura Neiji sent a telegram to welcome Deputy Chief of Staff Leng and his party, offering to take full responsibility for their protection.

The documents marked 'Zhong Zi No. 1' in the memorandum of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army in the Chinese War Zone delivered by Deputy Chief of Staff Imai have been duly received. It is hoped that your General Headquarters' forward command post in Nanjing will advance as quickly as possible within the scope of possibility.

The group flew to Chongqing together this morning, and most of the Chinese and foreign reporters have also left Zhijiang.</p>

The Japanese army and navy authorities stationed in Shanghai, in anticipation of the National Army's arrival, issued a special announcement yesterday, stating that the local Japanese army will continue to be responsible for public order and security. Regarding the entry of the National Army, it is hoped that the citizens of both countries will each follow the instructions of the authorities, remain calm and composed, and strictly avoid rash actions, so that everything can be implemented smoothly.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Maintaining Social Order: Reflections on Reading the Statements of Chiang's Representative and Deputy Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, ostensibly willing to surrender unconditionally, our compatriots throughout the country, with the ultimate realization of the eight-year War of Resistance, have been overjoyed and invigorated. In particular, the compatriots in the occupied areas, who have long been mired in darkness and suffering, have rediscovered the light. The knots of emotion have since loosened, and they cannot help but dance for joy.</p>
<p>However, during this transitional period when the Japanese army has surrendered but not yet been fully disarmed, and the Central Government has achieved victory but has not yet formally taken over the political power of the occupied cities, all our citizens must be especially vigilant and self-respecting to prevent patriotic motives from leading to national errors. Those agencies and responsible personnel of the Central Government who have arrived in the occupied areas must, at this time, serve as models for the people, prioritizing the maintenance of social order and the guidance of the normal life of the masses. The actions of their staff must be restrained by strict discipline so that compatriots in the occupied areas may witness and be convinced, thereby generating sincere gratitude to the Central Government and its affiliates, and moreover, generating sincere love and support for the central leaders. Only then can all major policies be gradually and smoothly advanced. This applies not only to one locality or one city but to all occupied areas, so that not only will treacherous elements have nowhere to hide, but also the perception of our country by the allied nations will surely increase its level of respect.</p>
<p>In terms of the actual dynamics of this city [Shanghai], to speak frankly, there have been some phenomena in recent weeks that cannot but cause concerned individuals to worry. However, given the complexity of the situation in Shanghai and the uniqueness of the environment, fortunately, no serious incidents have occurred. We cannot but admire the wise leadership and the arduous struggle of the special envoys of the Central Government. Reading the statements issued by Mr. Jiang Bocheng, the representative of Chairman Chiang, and Mr. Wu Shaoshu, the Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, further increases our admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>Representative Chiang stated that the military period has ended, and all actions must follow the right path. Deputy Mayor Wu first advised the citizens to abide by Chairman Chiang's exhortation to eliminate hostile sentiments towards the Japanese military and civilians, which is the attitude that a great nation should have and is also essential for maintaining order today. Secondly, Deputy Mayor Wu warned all parties that the punishment of traitors is governed by the laws of the nation, and free action is not allowed. Even accusations, investigations, trials, and judgments have a set procedure. At the same time, the severity of the crimes and the balance of merits and demerits must be considered, and no rash measures should be taken. The property of traitors should also be handled in accordance with the law and should not be arbitrarily disposed of. All of this is necessary to maintain social order. Otherwise, the free actions of various agencies and individuals may result in true traitors being able to speculate again, and a sense of fear may spread throughout society. Deputy Mayor Wu further hoped that all agencies and representatives in Shanghai would abide by the instructions of Mr. Jiang Bocheng, the representative of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and register with the representative's office as soon as possible to avoid impersonation. The acceptance of agencies, schools, groups, etc., should be handled uniformly by the Central Government. All of this is the fundamental policy for preventing the infiltration of traitors, stabilizing public sentiment, and maintaining social order today.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have the wise and timely instructions of Representative Chiang and Deputy Mayor Wu, and we deeply hope that all sectors of the city will understand the intentions of the two gentlemen, work together, maintain local order, welcome the Central Government's return to the capital and the day of the final victory celebration, and further prepare to concentrate the strength of all citizens to seek the new construction of a great Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Occurs Near Japan, Landing Must be Postponed for Two Days; Allied Forces to Enter Kyushu on September 1st</h3>
<p>Manila, 25th (Central News Agency) – MacArthur's headquarters announced that the landing operation had to be delayed by 48 hours due to successive hurricanes hitting the Ryukyu Islands and Japan. It is hoped that the wind and waves will be reduced by that time, to a level that will allow for landing. The surrender ceremony will be changed to September 2nd.</p>
<p>Manila, 25th (Central News Agency) – Marshal MacArthur's headquarters announced today that all plans previously set for the Japanese surrender had been postponed for 48 hours due to the hurricane. According to the Allied nations' notification to Japan, all intentions of the Allied side upon landing and the various materials that Japan should provide have been communicated. However, other parts of the occupation plan remain confidential, just like wartime military operations. Troopships, under the cover of the Third Fleet, will head to Tokyo. Once the landing begins, the US Marines on board will land in the Tokyo area. The first target of the occupying forces in Tokyo Bay will naturally be the Yokosuka Naval Base. US naval experts will inspect the secrets of the base at that time.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a broadcast from Tokyo Radio, Fukuoka news reports that the Western Military District Command issued a public announcement stating that the Allied occupation forces in the Kyushu area will begin landing around 10:00 AM on September 1st. Two aircraft of the advance force will land at Kanoya Airfield in Kagoshima Prefecture. Allied occupation forces transported by air will land at Kanoya Airfield. Allied surface ships will begin transporting troops to land near Takasu. The activities of the occupying forces will be restricted to the Kanoya-Takasu area.</p>
<h3>Delegations from Various Countries to Go to Tokyo Bay to Participate in the Signing of the Surrender</h3>
<p>Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) – Our delegation is scheduled to leave Manila by ship on the 25th with delegations from other countries to sail to Tokyo Bay to participate in the signing of the Japanese surrender agreement. Marshal MacArthur will fly there later. About 90 war correspondents will fly from here to Okinawa and then to Tokyo. More than 100 officers from MacArthur's headquarters will also fly from here on the same day. In order to obtain sufficient seating, the headquarters is now making every effort to use long-range aircraft, including B24 bombers, to allow journalists to send this historic news from Atsugi Airfield. Due to the inadequacy of Japanese telecommunications equipment, all news concerning the signing of the surrender agreement will be carried to Okinawa by special plane and then relayed to all parts of the world. However, it is hoped that news dispatches can be sent directly from Japan within two or three days after the signing of the surrender agreement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Requests to Send Reporters to Participate</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a US News Agency dispatch from Manila on the 24th, the Japanese government today requested Marshal MacArthur to allow Japanese reporters and news photographers to take photos and videos during the formal surrender ceremony and the Allied landing in Japan. There are about 25 reporters in the Kanoya area, and about 40 people will be present at Atsugi, Yokosuka, and on US battleships.</p>
<h3>Terauchi Decides to Send Numata to Mingaladon; Statement to Delhi Radio Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Headquarters of Allied Forces in Burma, 24th (Central News Agency) – General Count Hisaichi Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, spoke on Saigon Radio at 9:50 AM today. Delhi Radio informed him that he was speaking too fast, so he did so in a very slow tone, saying that Lieutenant General Numata, staff officer of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, will go to Mingaladon on the 26th with his entourage on two transport aircraft.</p>
<p>Field Correspondent of Reuters in Burma, 24th (Central News Agency) – Senior Officer Abuyaing met with a special Japanese envoy in a small wooden house a few miles east of West Tangkhone this afternoon. The meeting lasted two hours. A statement released after the meeting said that both sides believed that there was no need for further bloodshed between the "ceasefire" and the actual signing of the surrender documents in the Tokyo area.</p>
<p>London, 25th (TASS) – The Japanese military-controlled radio station in Singapore claimed that Major General Kan'in, a representative of the Japanese Emperor, arrived in Singapore on the 22nd to convey the armistice order to the local Japanese military commander.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Warns Japanese Aircraft Not to Fly</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a US News Agency dispatch from Manila on the 24th, Marshal MacArthur today instructed the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters regarding the handling of the Japanese Air Force. MacArthur warned the Japanese General Headquarters that Japanese aircraft, if not ordered to take off in any location, would be pursued by US aircraft. All Japanese aircraft must not fly in any way, otherwise, it will be regarded as a threat to the occupying forces.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Prepare to Occupy Japanese Northern Islands and Hokkaido; Japan Considers it Very Regrettable</h3>
<p>San Francisco, 25th (Associated Press) – Tokyo broadcast that, according to a report from Moscow Radio, Soviet airborne troops are now preparing to occupy Japan's northernmost islands and Hokkaido. The Japanese government telegraphed MacArthur: "If this report is true, the Japanese government considers it very regrettable. Japan is now making every effort to fulfill Your Excellency's requirements and to place the army, navy, and civilians under strict control. The Japanese people all hope that the Allied troops will enter Japan in accordance with regulations."</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese People Committing Mass Suicide</h3>
<p>San Francisco, 25th (Associated Press) – According to broadcasts intercepted here from Tokyo, large numbers of Japanese people gathered in front of the Imperial Palace today and committed mass suicide by seppuku. The broadcast reported that because the date of the Allied landing was imminent, large numbers of Japanese people were committing suicide by seppuku. According to a commentator in Tokyo, this kind of traditional Japanese spirit of suicide cannot be understood by the European and American Allied nations. The Japanese nation has a special sensitivity and has gone all out during the war. However, today, with blocked transportation and leaky houses, the suffering of defeat is boundless. A feeling of grief and anger is difficult to express. Since the suicide of the Minister of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations, the trend of seppuku has spread throughout the Japanese archipelago.</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Qingpu County, Jinze Township</h3>
<p>— Jū Jiā</p>
<p>From Shanghai, take a car on the Qinghu Highway to Qingpu, then transfer to a motorboat to Zhujiajiao, and finally take a rowboat or sailboat to reach Jinze Township. It is a town with a population of approximately 10,000.</p>
<p>Geography and Transportation</p>
<p>Jinze Township is bordered by Dianshan Lake to the north, Lianhu Lake to the east, and large lakes to the west and south. It is a town surrounded by water on all sides. Together with Shangta and Xicen, it forms the Jin-Shang-Xi three townships, the westernmost town in Qingpu County. It also borders Wujiang County and Jiashan County in Zhejiang Province, making it a town at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>Because the town is surrounded by large lakes, the only way to travel to and from other places is by boat. Before the war, the motorboat routes to other places included the Songjin Line, from the town to Songjiang; the Shangbei Line from Shanghai to Beiku; and the Zhuhe Line from Zhujiajiao to Jiashan, all of which passed through the town. After the war, although there were several attempts to restore these routes, they were all suspended due to the insecurity and frequent robberies, replaced by rowboats and sailboats. Currently, navigable routes include: east to Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, and Shanghai; south to Zhangliantang, Songjiang, and other places; west to Luxu, Wujiang, and other places; and north to Suzhou and other places. However, these routes are often suspended due to robberies or the imposition of extra taxes.</p>
<p>The postal service is a branch office managed by the Zhujiajiao Post Office. However, due to frequent delays in mail delivery, boatmen and rowers are entrusted to deliver mail to places with boat traffic.</p>

<p>Although the town has not been affected by the war, it is located in a remote area and suffers from poor transportation, making it a frequent target for bandits. After several invasions and disturbances by bandits, only a portion of the houses remain. Other areas, such as the town center, have been reduced to rubble. Although some small houses have been built for business, it is not as prosperous as before.</p>
<p>In terms of commerce, the exchange of agricultural products and daily necessities is the main focus. The manufacturing industry is underdeveloped. Currently, there are several oil mills and distilleries, but their products are not sufficient to meet local needs. Other daily necessities are supplied by Zhujiajiao, Xitang, Suzhou, and other places. Before the military grain collection ended in May of this year, the town had already finished its quota, so vendors used this place as a trading market. For a time, rice shops, rice mills, and millet stores were abundant, and commercial activity was more prosperous than in other places.</p>
<p>As for security, it can be said that this is the worst town in Qingpu County. One day, one army comes; the next day, another army leaves, creating a great commotion. As a result, various donations and taxes are forcibly collected. Corrupt officials also mingle among them to fill their own pockets, leaving the citizens in a situation where they dare to be angry but do not dare to speak out. Therefore, they are hoping that the authorities will quickly come to crack down on these lawless elements, so that the citizens can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Products and Local Customs</p>
<p>Agricultural products are the most abundant, with large yields of rice, wheat, beans, melons, and vegetables, sufficient to supply the local area with a surplus. Due to the abundance of rivers and lakes, aquatic products are also very rich, with yields of fish, shrimp, crabs, yellow eels, eels, soft-shelled turtles, and other products higher than in other parts of Qingpu County. There is also a large number of fishermen who depend on fishing for a living. In addition, Zhuangyuan cake, a local specialty, is famous throughout the Jiangnan region. However, due to the recent soaring sugar prices, there has been some corner-cutting and ingredient reduction, so the taste is not as good as before. Now that autumn has arrived, the yield of water caltrop is also high.</p>
<p>The residents of the town are mostly Buddhist. Every year on the 27th day of the third lunar month and the Double Ninth Festival on the 9th day of the ninth lunar month, there is a custom of welcoming gods and holding temple fairs. During these days, peddlers from various places gather here, and many devout men and women from various places come to burn incense. Pilgrims come from as far away as Shanghai, Jiangbei, and other places to burn incense and worship Buddha. The scene is almost as grand as the god-welcoming ceremony in Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Education and Religion</p>
<p>Before the war, the town had a county-run elementary school. Today, there is only one county-run elementary school, enrolling more than 300 students. However, the teachers have a low level of education. Often, those who have not graduated from elementary school are also teaching. The low level of the students can also be imagined. There are no middle schools. If one wants to pursue further education, one must go to other towns.</p>
<p>The town has many temples. It is said that in the past, many officials were supposed to be produced here, but after someone broke the spell, many Yin officials were added. Among them, Yíhào Temple (commonly known as Big Temple) is the largest. It is said to have been built before the Ming Dynasty and was equal to Jing Temple and Lingyun Temple in Hangzhou. However, after several fires, only a mountain gate and a few newly built small houses remain. Seeing this cannot help but evoke a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>Shangta and Xicen</p>
<p>Shangta is a town more than ten li away from Jinze on the shore of Dianshan Lake, second only to Jinze. The town's commerce is developed, but due to its location in the wilderness, it is easy for bandits to enter and exit. Most of the town's famous and wealthy merchants have fled to other places, so the current commerce is in decline and the town appearance is far from what it used to be.</p>
<p>Xicen is six li east of Jinze and eighteen li west of Zhujiajiao. It is a small town slightly larger than a village. The town has no more than a few dozen shops, and they all have very little capital, so the amount of commercial transactions is not large. Every morning, the whole town is filled with villagers, and the teahouses and taverns are noisy. It is truly a place for villagers to relax and enjoy themselves.</p>

<h3>Our Three-Year Construction Plan Requires US$2 Billion – Premier Song Finalizes Arrangements in the United States</h3>
<p>Washington, 24th – Crowley, the executor of the Lend-Lease Act in the United States, announced six economic aid measures to the Allied countries today as a replacement for the Lend-Lease Act. He also revealed that he had discussed post-war matters with our Premier Song Ziwen and finalized a three-year plan. Through this, our country can obtain a credit loan of US$2 billion from the United States. Premier Song originally intended to borrow a loan of US$4 billion and extend it. The six transitional measures are: Purchases of goods from the US Foreign Economic Administration should be stopped immediately, except for Allied countries that are willing to pay in cash or borrow credit loans from the Export-Import Bank. Allied countries can obtain all items that have been purchased and are currently being manufactured, but must pay annual interest of 2.875% for a period of 30 years. Allied countries can purchase goods stored in Allied countries based on the principles of cash payment and loans. For 60 days after the victory over Japan is declared, Allied countries can continue to obtain labor and facilities from the US Foreign Economic Administration. The United States will continue to provide shipping facilities for 30 days after the victory over Japan is declared to meet the needs of Allied countries. The United States still intends to use the Lend-Lease Act to transport goods to Allied countries so that the Allied governments have time to prepare everything and continue the supply of goods according to (unclear code) or loan principles.</p>

<h3>Standing Committee of National Defense Joint Conference – Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions (Continued)</h3>
<p>Mutual Love Among East Asian Nations</p>
<p>Here, I want to tell you about the three main principles for realizing nationalism: First, our Chinese government and people must embrace the highest sincerity and unwavering determination to never emulate Japan's treatment of Korea. We must sincerely love and support the growth of all nations that possess the ability to govern themselves and the spirit of independence, so that they achieve the goals of autonomy and independence. We must reverse the actions of Japanese imperialism and establish a foundation of national autonomy, freedom, and equality on the East Asian continent, in the full light of our anti-aggression war. For fifty years, our Chinese Kuomintang National Revolution, overthrowing the Manchus and resisting Japan, has fought not only for China's own freedom and equality, but also for the liberation and independence of Korea. From today onwards, we must adhere to the same principles and jointly respect the principles of national independence and equality with all relevant Allied nations, and permanently guarantee the status they should obtain. Second, for nations outside the provinces that possess the ability to govern themselves and have the will to be independent, and that have reached a level of economic and political development that allows them to be independent, our country must automatically support their independence and freedom with a loving and friendly attitude and spirit, and permanently regard them as equal fraternal nations of China, without harboring ill will or discrimination because they are separated from the motherland. And our various nations must express their wishes to their motherland in a harmonious and affectionate manner, following legal procedures to achieve their goals, and must not take actions to resist the motherland, so as not to cause mutual hatred between nations. Third, all ethnic groups, large and small, within the provinces must be given equal political and legal rights, and full freedom of belief and economy without interference, in order to achieve the goal of sincere unity, mutual friendship, and mutual assistance among our various ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Supporting the Political Development of Tibet</p>
<p>The political status of the Tibetan nation was decided at the Sixth National Congress to grant it a high degree of autonomy and support its political progress and the well-being of its people. I can responsibly declare that if the Tibetan nation expresses a desire for self-government at this time, our government will certainly grant it a high degree of autonomy in accordance with our consistent sincerity. If they are able to achieve economic conditions for independence and autonomy in the future, our government will also support their independence, just as it did with Outer Mongolia, but Tibet must consolidate its own permanent independent status, so as not to repeat the past mistakes of Korea.</p>
<p>Solving the problems of Outer Mongolia and Tibet is a major task of our National Revolution and a stage in the realization of nationalism. We must take full responsibility for solving this problem. I hope that all my compatriots in the country will also assist the government in solving this problem, based on the principles of our National Revolution and the spirit of nationalism, so that it can achieve a satisfactory result. For the sake of world peace and security, and for the consolidation and construction of the country, our advocacy of the national question of all the world must be based on the spirit of the Atlantic Charter and the Three Principles of the People to seek a solution.</p>
<p>Expressing Wishes Regarding Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma</p>
<p>I must also express our Chinese wishes regarding the national questions of several ethnic groups on our southwestern border, from the perspective of world peace and security: First, the Burmese nation has a deep historical relationship with China. During the War of Resistance, China sent troops to Burma twice. The number of our expeditionary forces who were directly or indirectly injured or killed totaled more than 200,000, and the losses of overseas Chinese are still countless. However, we respect the sovereignty of our allies and abide by international treaties. Once the mission of our army on the Burmese battlefield is completed, it will be immediately withdrawn to its own country. We regard this as an obligation that we, as a member of the Allied countries, should fulfill, without any other demands. However, we hope that our allies will actively improve and raise the political status of the Burmese nation, and provide rapid and effective assistance to our overseas Chinese in Burma in returning to work. Second, the relationship between the Thai nation and China is even deeper and more widespread than that with other nations. Our China is the country that fought with Thailand and was the first to be affected. Therefore, China has no objection to Thailand's future inclusion in the China war zone. We have always believed that Thailand's declaration of war against the United Nations was passive and purely due to the coercion of Japanese imperialism. Therefore, we hope that Thailand will restore its inherent independent and equal status after the war, and especially hope to establish normal international friendly relations with China as soon as possible. Third, during the War of Resistance against the Annam nation, China suffered huge losses in life and property because the Annam government could not protect its sovereignty and provided Japan with a base for invading China. However, today, in order to abide by the agreements of the Allied countries, we are dispatching troops to accept the surrender of the Japanese troops in the area north of 16 degrees north latitude, and we have no territorial ambitions for Vietnam. Our hope is that the Vietnamese nation can gradually achieve independence from autonomy to realize the provisions of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>The Status of Hong Kong to be Resolved Diplomatically</p>
<p>Later, we want to mention the Hong Kong issue. Hong Kong is a neighboring territory that shares the security of Guangdong. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was included in the China war zone. Now, when Japanese imperialism surrenders unconditionally, our China will never disregard international cooperation and the sovereignty of the Allied nations by taking advantage of the opportunity to accept the surrender. Therefore, we are unwilling to send troops to take over Hong Kong and cause misunderstandings among the Allied nations. But I can declare responsibly to the world and the national people: The status of Hong Kong was previously based on treaties between China and the United Kingdom, and will be amended in the future. It should also be established in accordance with the friendly consultation relationship between China and the United Kingdom. Our diplomatic policy and international policy advocate respecting treaties, based on law, and seeking reasonable solutions in accordance with the requirements of the times and actual needs. Now, all the concessions in China have been gradually recovered, and the lease treaty of Kowloon is no exception. However, our China will also take the diplomatic and treaty path between the two countries to solve this last outstanding problem.</p>
<p>Encouraging Unity and Dedicating to Revival</p>
<p>In short, this World War is an unprecedented war in human history. Today, all the Allied nations hope that this unprecedented war will be the last war. Our China has fought the longest and suffered the most, so we are the most eager for peace. We must do our best to promote the realization of everything that can promote domestic unity and international peace. We must fight to the end together with our allies around the world to establish a friendly relationship of independence and freedom for all the nations and countries of the world, to maintain all human spirits, and to build a permanent peaceful life based on mutual assistance, so as not to allow the discovery of power politics in the world again, and to prevent all the nations of the world from suffering from inequality, unfreedom, and all the suffering of poverty and terror. In this sense, I believe that the realization of the principles of national equality and national independence is the most urgent task. The National Government must, on the basis of China's founding spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and the consistent national policy of the National Revolution, take advantage of this dawn of world peace to implement nationalism. This is my lifelong wish and should be understood by friendly countries around the world. This is indeed the guarantee of world peace and China's stability. I hope that all my compatriots in the country will unite and work together to achieve this goal. Then, national revival and national construction can be completed in a short time, and the heroic spirits of the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed in our eight-year War of Resistance can be comforted without regret. Since the First World War, the motto that our founding father Sun Yat-sen has taught us and exhorted the world will also be achieved.</p>
<h3>United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Concludes – Unanimously Approves Providing Relief to Taiwan and Korea</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 24th – The Third Session of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has held a total of thirteen plenary sessions and many group meetings since its opening. The meeting ended tonight. Our representatives Jiang Tingfu and Li Zhuomin left here to return to their country on the same night after the closing of the meeting. Before his departure, Jiang met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and said that China's relief and rehabilitation plan submitted to the UNRRA will be implemented as planned. The main points have not changed substantially, but some details need to be revised. The meeting unanimously approved the expansion of UNRRA's work to liberated areas such as Taiwan and Korea. Jiang believes that the most important thing is that the representatives of various countries are willing to help all countries restore their vitality in the post-war world and cooperate sincerely with this in mind. However, some discussions have also sparked heated debates. Later, regarding Sino-British relations, he said that the experience gained by the Chinese delegation at the UNRRA proves that the United Kingdom is one of China's true friends, and the prospects for close cooperation between China and the United Kingdom in the future are extremely bright.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th – According to a report from the US News Agency, London, 24th: The representatives of various countries attending the Third Session of the Council of the UNRRA unanimously approved the provision of relief to Korea and Taiwan, and unanimously approved the request for all countries to donate more funds to the UNRRA, with the amount set at 1% of the country's fiscal revenue in the 1942-1943 fiscal year. US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton estimates that the cost of relief for Korea, Taiwan, Italy, and Austria will be $550 million. The UNRRA's work in Europe should be completed by the end of 1946, and in the Pacific and East Asia a few months later.</p>
<h3>World Federation of Trade Unions - Our Delegation Determined</h3>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The World Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to convene in Paris on September 25th. Our national delegation has designated Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, as the head of the delegation. The members are An Futing (coal miner), Liu Songshan (railway worker), and Chen Tiefu (Chongqing power worker). They are scheduled to fly to France around the 5th of next month to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Gold Prices - Minimal Fluctuations, Grain Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - Gold prices have fluctuated minimally in recent days. The opening price today was 88,000, followed by 88,009, with some transactions. The closing price was 88,000. The US dollar price hovered between 1,200 and 1,300 yuan throughout the day. Although the wholesale price of tung oil further dropped to 30,000 yuan per market catty, the retail price remained at 600-700 yuan per market catty. Retail Rong oil was 500 yuan per market catty, also higher than the wholesale price. Retail prices of general merchandise have begun to fall recently. According to those familiar with the market situation, with the opening of navigation on the Sichuan River imminent, it is feared that general merchandise prices will be difficult to improve.</p>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - As the autumnal equinox approaches, new grains are successively appearing on the market. Moreover, due to the decline in prices of various goods in the past ten days, grain prices in the city have also fallen, especially the prices of coarse grains, which have dropped significantly.</p>
<h3>Automobiles to Switch to Right-Hand Traffic - To Be Implemented Starting New Year's Day Next Year</h3>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The switch to right-hand traffic for automobiles is a major initiative for our country to adapt to the global trend. In principle, everything has been approved. However, the implementation date, during this period of urgent recovery, coupled with the fact that publicity has not yet been carried out in the recovered areas, leads to a deep concern that temporary haste will inevitably lead to many errors. The Wartime Transportation Administration has now submitted a request to the Military Affairs Commission to postpone the implementation until January 1st of next year. As soon as approval is granted, it will be implemented.</p>
<h3>German Scientists and Technicians - To Be Utilized by the United States</h3>
<p>Frankfurt, Continental, September 25th (Central News Agency) - An American official in the European theater of war announced yesterday that a large number of German scientists and technicians will be transferred to the United States to continue various military experiments and research. In fact, they have been engaged in American military experiments and research work since the German surrender. At the same time, he continued to point out that these Germans will not be familiar with various programs within the United States. Once the work is completed, they will be sent back to their home country.</p>
<h3>American Naval Power - The Driving Force Behind Defeating Japan</h3>
<p>New York, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The New York newspaper stated in yesterday's editorial: "Regardless of how Japan insists that its defeat was due to the atomic bomb, the power of our navy was indeed a major driving force behind the defeat of Japan, which is undeniable." The newspaper added: "Before the first atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima, Japan's combat power had been almost completely lost. When they lost control of the sea, the disappearance of Japan's control over its homeland and the Western Pacific was already imminent. The naval power and air supremacy of the United States enabled the United States to achieve victory at an early date. In history, no other country has suffered such a disastrous defeat at sea as Japan did in this war. Of Japan's twelve battleships, only one remains, damaged and without sailors; of the two hundred and two transport ships, only four remain, damaged and without sailors; of the nineteen heavy cruisers, only two remain, and later these two remaining heavy cruisers were also destroyed; none of the twenty light cruisers exist; of the one hundred and fifty-six destroyers, only twenty-six remain; and of the one hundred and forty-six submarines, only twenty-two remain." The newspaper further compared Japan's naval losses with the naval losses announced by the U.S. Navy on May 31st: one battleship "Arizona," five large transport ships, six small transport ships, six heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, sixty destroyers, and forty-three submarines. However, the losses of American ships were completely compensated by the efforts of new construction. Japan built very few new ships from December 7, 1941, to August 18, 1945. Therefore, the so-called atomic bomb is merely a revolution that changes the concepts of war and defense tactics. This bomb only reveals the corruption and incompetence of all the weapons that should be used on land, sea, and air in the present world. Therefore, we should understand that in this war, the naval power was indeed the main force in destroying the enemy, both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific. The naval power, including the air transport power that guides the progress of the war and occupies the coast, together formed a powerful supply line. Even the first transportation of the first atomic bomb and other agricultural products to Saipan was by a cruiser named "Indianapolis."</p>
<h3>Japan Dissolves Military Supply Bureau</h3>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Tokyo on the 23rd, several regional military supply bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Port Superintendent have been ordered to be dissolved.</p>
<h3>Educational Recovery Work Methods in Recovered Areas - Ministry of Education Circulates Instructions for All Provinces and Cities to Follow</h3>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Education had already jointly formulated various recovery plans with relevant parties.

The Ministry of Education has decided to formulate methods separately based on the actual situation. The emergency methods for educational recovery in various provinces and cities in the recovered areas have been circulated to all provinces and cities for compliance.</p>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - Methods for educational recovery work in various provinces and cities in the recovered areas: 1.

An assessment committee should be organized for educational administrative personnel, school teachers, and social education personnel. 8. The personnel needed by schools and social education institutions at all levels should be registered and employed after short-term training. 9. The schools and social education institutions at all levels that were used before the war should be restored as soon as possible within half a year. Those newly established ones that are permanent should be maintained as usual. 10. National middle schools that are moved back or transferred to their original provinces should be included in the middle school plan, and teachers and staff who moved back from the rear should be given priority for employment. Students who have not entered such schools in the rear should be assisted in moving back and given priority for admission (the detailed method will be issued separately). 11. The original buildings of schools and social education institutions at all levels should be recovered, repaired, and used, or all public places should be used, and the necessary equipment should be prepared and supplemented immediately. 12.

<h3>The U.S. Will Drop Medicine into Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Chongqing, September 25th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Military Headquarters in the China Theater announced on the 25th that the captured Vice Admiral Kaneda is in good health. News from Beiping stated that 28 members of the Psychological Warfare Team and detainees were evacuated on the 24th. None of them are seriously ill. As of 11:00 AM today, no information has been received regarding the completion of the evacuation. The U.S. Air Force is preparing to drop a batch of medicines into Hong Kong on the 26th. The U.S. rescue team went to the Japanese military liaison office in Sai Ying Pun and the mouth of the Leizhou Peninsula on the 22nd. The team entered the mouth of the sea with a white flag. The Japanese army returned them to use trucks. The team arrived in Sai Ying Pun on the 23rd, and the Japanese army prohibited the team from using the radio at will.</p>
<h3>The United States Should Develop the Atomic Energy Industry as Much as Possible - Democratic Party Members Advocate</h3>
<p>Washington, September 24th (Central News Agency) - Senator Taunicher, a Democratic member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, suggested that the Economic Council and the Security Council of the United Nations should carefully consider keeping the secrets of atomic energy. At the same time, he issued a warning that the United States must do its best to develop the industrial effectiveness of atomic energy, otherwise, the United States will inevitably become a third-rate power in the next fifteen to twenty years.</p>
<h3>China and the United States Negotiate Loans to Assist Chinese Students Studying in the United States</h3>
<p>New York, September 24th (Central News Agency) - Wall Street Journal News: After the United States stopped Lend-Lease supplies, 600 Chinese students who were studying transportation and other subjects with Lend-Lease assistance in the United States suddenly lost their supplies. China and the United States are negotiating special loan methods, which may solve the current difficulties. It seems that American factories providing training opportunities without paying wages would not be a problem. It is also learned that another batch of 300 Chinese students, assisted by Lend-Lease, are on their way to the United States from India for further study.</p>
<h3>Korean Unity Committee - Telegrams MacArthur Expressing Congratulations and Cooperation</h3>
<p>Washington (Central News Agency) - The Korean Unity Committee, representing major Korean organizations in the United States, Hawaii, Mexico, and Cuba, telegraphed General MacArthur expressing congratulations and cooperation. It also requested MacArthur to transmit the telegram to Korea, which was the first telegram to Korea since the Pearl Harbor incident. It was sent to the editor of the Seoul newspaper and the leader of the independence movement, Lee Gwang-su, and stated: We dare to urge our people to give General MacArthur full cooperation. The Allied countries jointly deal with Korean affairs. For the sake of the initial achievements of the country, our people need a plan of concerted efforts and responsible politics, economy and society to restore friendly relations with China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The telegram was signed by the Chairman of the United Korean National Committee and the backbones of the Korean Independence Movement.</p>

<h3>Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Mr. Lu Jingshi, Arrives in Shanghai - Discusses the Future Tasks of the Labor Movement in the City</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs of the National Government, was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in early June of this year to be transferred as the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Labor Movement of the Military Affairs Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Workers' Loyal Righteousness National Salvation Army. At the same time, he was also appointed by the Ministry of Social Affairs as the Special Commissioner of Jinghu. After Mr. Lu was appointed, he immediately sneaked into the southeast, mobilized all parties, and fulfilled his original tasks. Now that the war has ended and the war of resistance has been completed, the work in the Shanghai area is being promoted. He arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday (25th) at 2:00 PM. A large number of people from all walks of life in Shanghai drove to the station to welcome him. After Mr. Lu got off the car, he discussed everything with Mr. Bo Cheng and Mr. Wu Shaozong, Chairman of the Municipal Party Department. All circles in the city held a grand banquet that night to comfort Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu gave instructions on the future tasks of the city's public organization training, social recovery and relief work, and leadership of the city's labor movement. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit, and Mr. Lu gave the following speech:</p>
<p>Public Organization Training</p>
<p>Mr. Lu first talked about three points on the social aspect: 1. Public Organization Training: I will handle everything in accordance with government laws and regulations. Regarding the reorganization of groups in the recovered areas, the government's regulations stipulate that all groups recognized by the past puppet organizations should be dissolved. All groups that were approved by party and government agencies before the August 13th Battle that are still loyal and have not been tainted will be recognized in accordance with the law. Many groups are in good condition, but their numbers are insufficient, or due to various changes. They should be reorganized and registered in the future. Applications can be made in accordance with the law. All matters within the scope of the Shanghai Municipal Government will be handled by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. During the current transition period, it will be handled by the Municipal Party Department. All those that do not belong to the scope of the Shanghai Municipal Government will be handled by me on behalf of the Ministry of Social Affairs. In short, all existing groups are currently handled separately by the Municipal Party Department and the Provincial Chairman.</p>
<p>Social Relief Work: For the current wartime relief, the Central Government has set up a special agency to plan and handle post-war relief. Personnel will be sent to preside over it soon. It is hoped that during this period, the power of the people can be mobilized to establish a unified relief organization to cooperate with government relief agencies and handle it together.</p>
<p>Social Recovery Policy: The central government is working hard to unify the methods, and in the future, the central ministers will urge the local governments to handle it in accordance with the promulgated methods.</p>
<p>Labor Movement Tasks</p>
<p>The following is a report on the labor movement tasks: Regarding the labor movement, the local government will be responsible for guidance and supervision. Government laws and regulations stipulate that all workers must have a trade union organization. In the most important transitional stage in the future, I hope that labor friends will clearly understand the meaning and abide by the labor-management cooperation policy stipulated by the government and work hard to build the industry. Since the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, no fewer than two or three hundred workers in Shanghai who struggled for the country in hardship and suffered disasters and difficulties from the enemy and puppets. I will personally visit and comfort their families and give them pensions. Mr. Lu also stated that the Shanghai labor movement after that will uphold the central government's intentions, and ask Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's representative in Shanghai, Chiang Bo-cheng, for instructions, and consult with the municipal authorities at any time. In the future, he will command and lead all the workers in the city to assist the local authorities in maintaining public security and stabilizing social order.</p>
<h3>Member He Xuandao Hosts All Circles - Reports on the Progress of Propaganda Work</h3>
<p>Mr. He Minhun, a member of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, hosted the elders and leaders of all circles in the city at the Meihua Restaurant yesterday (25th) afternoon. More than 60 people were present, including Ding Fubao, Shen Yanfang, Rong Hongyuan, Li Denghui, Shen Shuyu, Jin Zongcheng, Wu Yunxiu, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Yan Huijing, Gui Chongji, Yang Yunzhong, Xu Jiyu, Qin Runqing, Yuan Fudeng, Guo Shun, Lin Kanghou, Wang Boyuan, Zhu Yinjiang, Cai Shengbai, Xiang Kangyuan, Feng Bingnan, Fang Jiaobo, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Songtao, Sun Enlin, Ge Jialiang, Feng Shuhua, and others. During the meeting, Member He reported on the organization and work of the Propaganda Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, which has nine members, divided into three districts: Northeast, North China, and Southeast. He himself is responsible for the Southeast region. He explained two points:</p>
<p>The progress of the work and self-reflection. I was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to return east in the winter of the year before last to prepare to welcome the general counter-offensive of the National Army. Due to environmental reasons, I could not work publicly. When Japan accepted the surrender, I went to Beijing to work, and everything went smoothly. However, in Shanghai, due to the special environment, if the work is slightly careless, it is easy to cause misunderstandings, and I have adjusted it separately since returning to Shanghai. 2. The whole cooperation and sincere seamlessness. In the future, Mr. Zhao Jinqing will take the position of director of the Shanghai Office, who will be able to cooperate sincerely with the Party Department and ask Mr. Chiang Bo-cheng, the representative of the Committee, for instructions at any time to promote the work. There are many worries in the Southeast region, so propaganda work cannot be ignored. In the future, when the National Army officially arrives in various places and order is restored, the propaganda work will naturally come to an end. Now that the Japanese army has formally surrendered, it is no longer an era of secret work. I hope that there is no need to excessively stimulate others. As for the issue of puppet personnel, we are not judges and it is inconvenient to talk more. After finishing the speech, Lin Kanghou replied on behalf of the guests, explaining the expectations of the people, and then dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Figures</p>
<h3>Striving to Maintain Shanghai's Security</h3>
<p>— Fang Cheng</p>
<p>—— A Visit with Chief Secretary Cheng of the Action Corps——</p>
<p>We flipped through Shanghai newspapers from the 21st and 23rd of this month and saw the headline in the local news section: "Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters Announces Important Personnel Changes." After carefully counting the names on the list of so-called important personnel from beginning to end, it seemed that most were familiar faces. However, the name of Secretary-General and concurrently Military Law Director Cheng Kexiang appeared to be new. The Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters was established by order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, responsible for maintaining security in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area, a very arduous task. At this turning point in the situation and in this complex environment, ensuring Shanghai's security is extremely difficult. Mr. Cheng, serving as the headquarters' secretary-general and concurrently military law director, undoubtedly bears a crucial responsibility in ensuring Shanghai's security. Entrusting such an important position to someone unfamiliar inevitably causes surprise, because in Chinese officialdom, the secretary-general is always a confidant of the superior. We believe that if a confidant is also a talent, there is nothing to criticize. However, if it is merely a matter of placing a confidant, or a confidant occupying a key position, then there will be no bright future for any political or economic undertaking.</p>
<p>Given the current and future importance of Shanghai's security, the citizens must be very concerned about the work of the Shanghai Action Corps, which is responsible for security. At the same time, they harbor a deep sense of expectation and doubt towards Secretary-General Cheng Kexiang, who holds an important position. Is Mr. Cheng a confidant of Mr. Zhou Fohai? Is he chosen for the job based on ability, or is the job created for him? Mr. Cheng has become a figure of the moment with a significant impact on Shanghai's security, thus prompting us to conduct this interview.</p>
<p>A Struggle of Forgetting Life and Death, United in Purpose</p>
<p>In a quiet and refined corner of western Shanghai, the reporter arrived at the Shanghai Action Corps Headquarters. After presenting a business card and requesting an interview with Secretary-General Cheng, he was quickly led in by an attendant. In an office decorated with simple, plain, and tidy furnishings, a middle-aged man wearing a military uniform, full of energy, with a strong physique and a refined yet resolute air between his brows, walked out to greet the reporter warmly with a handshake. This was Secretary-General Cheng Kexiang, whom I wanted to interview.</p>
<p>"Secretary-General Cheng must be very busy these days. I apologize for the intrusion," the reporter said, exchanging pleasantries. "Because in Shanghai, where the environment is extremely complex, maintaining security is already difficult in normal times. In the current extraordinary and exceptionally difficult situation, petty criminals and bandits seize opportunities to cause trouble. Maintaining security is truly the most difficult task." Mr. Cheng spoke forcefully and calmly, giving me an excellent impression.</p>
<p>"However, we are entrusted with great responsibility by Chairman Chiang and have the hopes of the Shanghai citizens below. No matter how difficult, we must work together with one heart and one mind to complete our mission. I personally have long decided to dedicate all my energy and wisdom to striving for my ambition. To remove obstacles and overcome difficulties, the only way is for all staff to forget life and death and struggle with a united purpose. Therefore, under such an ambition, the busyness of affairs is self-evident, and indeed, it is imperative to be busy." Mr. Cheng continued, expressing an even stronger work ethic.</p>
<p>"The current security task in Shanghai is indeed extremely arduous, and there must be thorough arrangements in place. When will the National Army arrive? This is a question of great concern to the citizens of Shanghai," the reporter interjected.</p>
<p>"Various measures to maintain security are already thoroughly arranged. Working comrades can also understand Chairman Chiang's intentions and firmly adhere to their positions. However, security is comprehensive and wide-ranging. The efforts of the military, police, and government alone are insufficient. All citizens must understand the importance of their own roles in relation to security, hoping that everyone will take themselves seriously, examine themselves, and move from passively not hindering security to actively cooperating in security. In that case, there will be no problem with Shanghai's security. The Central Government has already issued a clear order appointing General Tang Enbo to be responsible for taking over Beijing and Shanghai. The National Army will arrive soon. However, while the arrival of the National Army will certainly increase security forces, our citizens and excellent working comrades will always be the main force in maintaining local order. This should not be overlooked." Mr. Cheng further solemnly emphasized the responsibilities that citizens should bear in maintaining security.</p>
<p>A Twisting, Thrilling History of Struggle</p>
<p>"I am bold enough to ask about Secretary-General Cheng's past experiences." The reporter changed the subject, finally voicing the questions of himself and the general public. Upon hearing my question, Mr. Cheng's attitude immediately changed, revealing a kind and approachable smile. He tightly clasped his hands together, looked up at the portrait of Chairman Chiang hanging on the wall, and remained silent for a moment. After a moment of silence, he began to speak:</p>
<p>"Although I am a member of the Kuomintang, I have always held the belief that I am participating in the national revolution's struggle as a purely common person. If you want to talk about my history of struggle, it is neither short nor long, already spanning eighteen or nineteen years. Starting from participating in the workers' movement, throughout these eighteen or nineteen years, if I were to recount my experiences in detail, perhaps you could write a very twisting and thrilling long novel.</p>
<p>"I have been to various provinces and places, and I have been close to all classes, from high-ranking officials to common peddlers. Therefore, I can understand the trends of each class. I have been through imprisonment and private torture, experiencing life-and-death situations and terrifying and dangerous lives. Therefore, I can experience the reality of various organizations. Because I have actually participated in the national revolution's struggle for twenty years, it has formed my life habits, fostering a strict and simple life from hunger, hardship, and poverty. Until now, I still take it as a matter of course and feel comfortable with it.</p>
<p>"Although I have no tile above my head or land beneath my feet, I have many comrades and abundant friendships, enough to make me forget all the hardships and further strengthen my will to struggle." Mr. Cheng spoke eloquently and methodically about his history of struggle. I felt an infinite respect rising in my heart. Our nation's final restoration of light is entirely entrusted to these individuals with ambition and talent. At the same time, it made me feel even more ashamed.</p>
<p>Vast Comrades and Abundant Friendships</p>
<p>"This time, I participated in the work of the Shanghai Action Corps, selected entirely as a citizen. I personally also want to contribute all my energy and wisdom as a citizen and party member, based on my past struggles. Therefore, I participated in this work." Mr. Cheng then explained the process of participating in this work, and I finally realized that while it is the custom in Chinese political circles for the secretary-general to always be a confidant of the superior, there are also exceptions.</p>
<p>"Some people may think that because I am a revolutionary fighter, I must be impulsive and out of touch with the world. In fact, revolutionary struggle is my ambition. I believe my personality is gentle because I believe in Buddhism and advocate 'generosity and kindness' towards everything in the past." Finally, Mr. Cheng explained his personality with a smile. This frank and approachable attitude gave people a warmer feeling, so it was no accident that he said, "I have many comrades and adequate friendships."</p>
<p>Having talked to this point, much time had already passed. The reporter stood up to take his leave. From another perspective, we learned that he was from Jiangxi Province, about thirty-eight or thirty-nine years old, truly a young and energetic fighter.</p>

<h3>The Military Period Has Ended. All Actions Must Follow the Proper Path. Chairman's Representative Mr. Jiang Bocheng Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>After Deputy Mayor Wu and the Military Special Envoy arrived in Shanghai in recent days, they made statements on the city's municipal administration. The reporter visited Chairman's representative Mr. Jiang Bocheng yesterday. According to Mr. Jiang, since he has respectfully followed the Chairman's instructions and issued announcements, and earnestly informed all working comrades not to engage in any transgressive behavior, the people's hearts have gradually stabilized. After Special Envoy Wu Shao-shu arrived here, he met with me multiple times and expressed his earnest responsibility for the city's security and order and the maintenance of normalcy, reassuring the citizens. The points made by Special Envoy Wu in his statement yesterday are completely consistent with my opinions, especially regarding the fact that the mission of working comrades who were working undercover in Shanghai during the war has now ended and should be concluded as soon as possible. I hope that these working comrades will end their activities as soon as possible and await unified arrangements. As for working comrades who are permitted to continue their official and public work according to regulations, I also hope that they will listen to the guidance of the respective departments. In any case, it is absolutely forbidden to abuse power and engage in illegal or transgressive behavior. It must be known that the military period has ended, and from now on, all actions must follow the proper path. We can no longer use any means necessary, as in the period of secret activities. I, as the Chairman's representative stationed in Shanghai, will not tolerate anything that damages the nation's prestige or affects the reputation of all civil servants. Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, a place of international observation. I can only hope that all working comrades will pay special attention to their actions.</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Department Commissioner Feng Youzhen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Issuing a Statement Outlining Future Goals</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Youzhen, Special Commissioner for Southeast China War Zone Propaganda under the Central Propaganda Department, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at 1:45 PM yesterday. Representatives from various groups, numbering in the thousands, and the heads of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Commissioner, Fei Yimin, Zhu Shao-li, Cheng Yuxi, and others, gathered at the North Station to welcome him. Despite the heavy rain, the crowds stood in the downpour, cheering for Mr. Feng. As Mr. Feng alighted from the train, military music played and firecrackers resounded. He nodded to the welcomers and proceeded to the reception room at the military station for a brief rest, then went to the Shanghai Office of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission to meet with Mr. Jiang Bocheng, Deputy Mayor Wu Shaoshu, and various party, government, and military authorities. Mr. Li Qiusheng, secretary of the Special Commissioner's Office, and Jiang Peidong and He Zhongheng, directors of the Telecommunications Office, accompanied Mr. Feng. The Special Commissioner's Office began operating in Shanghai from today. Mr. Feng also issued a statement to the reporter, recounting his past secret work in Shanghai and outlining his future goals. The contents of his statement are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Feng's Statement</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance against Japan began, I was appointed to concurrently serve as the Shanghai Commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department, presiding over propaganda work in the provinces and cities of Southeast China. I worked together with colleagues in the cultural and journalistic fields here to devote ourselves to the War of Resistance and promote national policy. I am extremely impressed by the arduous struggles and tragic sacrifices of the Shanghai colleagues. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Shanghai press corps lost their positions. I was then appointed as Special Commissioner for War Zone Propaganda in Southeast China, establishing an office in Tunxi to promote propaganda work in various occupied areas. During these three years, many colleagues in the Shanghai press and cultural circles were still able to work hard and fight to the last moment. I know this very well. Those who succumbed to the pressures of life, or whose will was weak, and who defected halfway, were also quite numerous. This is very regrettable. Now, fortunately, the War of Resistance has victoriously ended, and under the leadership of the Shanghai mayor, we will soon return to normalcy. I was ordered to move this office to Shanghai and hope that all colleagues in the cultural and journalistic fields will return to their positions and redouble their efforts, working with a consistent, upright, and just stance in accordance with the central government's national policy, to complete the rehabilitation work in propaganda. Shanghai's cultural and journalistic colleagues have made extremely significant contributions to the great cause of the War of Resistance in the past. I hope that in the future, they will also make even greater efforts for the future of national construction, making continued efforts, establishing a good reputation, playing a leading role, and combating distorted fallacies. I am willing to lead my colleagues in this office to encourage each other with you.</p>

<h3>Correcting Current Malpractices</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>"During the war, any means that could strike the enemy or increase our strength should be chosen, especially when the war reaches its final stage, which is unavoidable." These are the words of Deputy Mayor Wu Shaoshu. But now the enemy has officially sued for peace and the war has ended, so Mr. Wu added that part of the work has lost its significance.</p>
<p>"The military period has ended, and from now on, all actions must follow the proper path. We can no longer use any means necessary, as in the period of secret activities." These are the words of Chairman's representative Mr. Jiang Bocheng.</p>
<p>The main intention of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Wu's remarks is to maintain order in Shanghai and uphold the authority of the Central Government. What we have seen and heard in the past ten days makes us feel even more that the remarks of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Wu are indeed good words aimed at the current malpractices.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is the Chairman's representative in Shanghai, and Mr. Wu is in charge of the city's party and government affairs. What they say naturally carries the determination and dignity that must be implemented.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chao</p>
<p>The first newspaper to appear in America was the Boston News-Letter, a weekly publication that began in Boston in August 1704. Following Boston, a newspaper was published in Philadelphia in 1719. The first newspaper published in New York was the "New York Gazette," and in 1773, the "New York Journal" was published. The Civil War significantly stimulated the newspaper industry, leading to its continuous progress and substantial reforms. Recently, the United States has had over 20,000 periodicals (including over 2,500 daily newspapers), with a total circulation of approximately 220 million copies, including a total daily newspaper circulation of about 33 million copies.</p>
<p>Investment in the periodical publishing industry ranks fifth among total industrial investment in the United States. Most American newspapers are published multiple times a day (two to five times), with each issue containing dozens of pages (approximately 60 to 80 pages, and often over 200 pages for Sunday editions). Many pages are occupied by advertisements, in addition to long novels, detailed sports reports, and numerous illustrations. Illustrated magazines are also very popular, often with circulations exceeding one million copies.</p>
<p>The "concerns" (large monopolistic organizations) in the American news industry are also very large-scale. Major examples include the "Scripps-Howard" organization, founded in 1878, which E.V. Scripps consolidated from 26 daily newspapers (including the "World Telegram," "Cleveland News," "Pittsburgh Press," "Cincinnati Post," "Baltimore Post," "San Francisco News," "Washington News," and "Detroit News," etc.). Another example is the "Hearst Concern," established in 1895, which owns 23 daily newspapers and eight weekly publications (published on Sundays), (including the "New York American," "New York Journal," "Boston Globe," "Boston American," "Chicago American," "San Francisco Examiner," "Washington Times," and "Baltimore News," etc.). Other newspaper consortiums include groups led by C.HK. Katchis, Frank E. Gannett, James M. Cox, and others.</p>
<p>Among the major news agencies that have correspondents stationed in every country and corner of the world, the largest American news agency, the "Associated Press" (A.P.), stands out. Founded in 1900, it has a large number of publishers, 150 branch offices, and constantly provides news and information from every corner of the world. In addition, there is the "United Press" (U.P.), founded in 1907, which belongs to the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate mentioned above and has its own dedicated telegraph network. The Hearst syndicate also owns the "International News Service" (I.N.S), founded in 1909, which serves not only the Hearst newspapers and other domestic newspapers, but also various British newspapers.</p>
<p>The best-selling newspaper in the United States is the "Daily News," founded in 1920, with a circulation of 1.3 million copies in New York. As for the largest newspapers in the United States, one is the "New York Times," founded in 1851, which is the organ of the Democratic Party and has a circulation of about 400,000 copies. The second is the "New York Herald Tribune," created in 1924 by merging the "Herald" and the "Tribune" (founded in 1841). It publishes 100 to 140 pages daily, is the organ of the Republican Party, and has a circulation of 1.29 million copies. The third is the "Chicago Daily Tribune," published in Chicago, which was founded in 1847 and has a daily circulation of about 800,000 copies. In addition, the "Chicago Daily News," founded in 1877, sells 440,000 copies daily. The "World-Telegram" is published by merging the "Telegram" (founded in 1867) and the "World" (founded in 1860), with a circulation of 236,000 copies, and is a major newspaper in the Scripps-Howard group. The "New York Evening Post" was founded in 1801 and belongs to the Katchis-Martin group, selling 100,000 copies daily (in addition to the illustrated magazine "Saturday Evening Post," which has a circulation of 2 million copies). Since 1940, a new newspaper, "P.M." (Post Meridian), also known as "Afternoon Paper", has appeared in New York. The city of Chicago also publishes the Communist Party's newspaper "Daily Worker" and the Communist Youth League's newspaper "Young Worker," etc. (Translated from the chapter "The United States of America" published in the Soviet Union).</p>
<p>Regeneration</p>
<p>— Xu Wenhu</p>
<p>Unprecedented suffering,</p>
<p>Unprecedented trials,</p>
<p>An unprecedented mission descends upon our shoulders.</p>
<p>Sweating, enduring tears, shedding blood;</p>
<p>Clenching our teeth—</p>
<p>We struggled bitterly for eight years!</p>
<p>Countless lives, countless properties;</p>
<p>And countless irredeemable losses:</p>
<p>The heroic souls of martyrs;</p>
<p>The ardent blood of brave men</p>
<p>Fearless spirit combined with superhuman endurance</p>
<p>Grasp the victory of today!</p>
<p>Wipe away the blood and tears, tear off the black纱 from our sleeves</p>
<p>Hang the bright national flag high</p>
<p>Exhale a long, pent-up breath,</p>
<p>Straighten our chests with dignity;</p>
<p>Everyone laughs heartily!</p>
<p>The new world has arrived!</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of dead and wounded;</p>
<p>Millions upon millions of [unclear],</p>
<p>Only then do we have the millions upon millions of people singing with joy today.</p>
<p>Under our feet are the bloodstains of soldiers,</p>
<p>Before our eyes are destroyed villages.</p>
<p>Weeds grow in the fields,</p>
<p>Empty frames stand in the factory buildings.</p>
<p>We must rebuild what is destroyed;</p>
<p>We must restore what is lost.</p>
<p>Roll up our sleeves and work hard!</p>
<p>The new world needs tireless cultivation.</p>
<p>Use our sweat to irrigate the barren fields,</p>
<p>Use tireless strength to rebuild a tireless country.</p>
<p>Use boundless perseverance to win freedom;</p>
<p>Use the greatest sacrifice to win peace.</p>
<p>Eight years of suffering ends today,</p>
<p>A century of debts are settled today!</p>
<p>Tear off the black紗 from our sleeves,</p>
<p>Hang the bright national flag high</p>
<p>The new world begins,</p>
<h3>Give Me Back My Freedom</h3>
<p>— Ting Ruo</p>
<p>The long-separated free discussion has arrived with peace. Thinking of the freedom we have regained, I feel especially close to it. For a moment, I am joyous, excited, and comforted. Like a passenger rescued from a shipwreck, I feel safe in my life again. Du Fu has a poem that says, "Suddenly hearing of the recovery of Subei beyond the sword, I was filled with tears when I first heard the news." It describes his own emotions of being overjoyed and shedding tears, and when I recite it today, I feel that there is no exaggeration. Just imagine, from now on, our lives, property, speech, and actions will all be protected by law. We will no longer be intimidated by guns for no reason. As long as we have the ability, there is no place in the country or even the world that we cannot go. We will not fall into a "pit" when walking at night, and prices will gradually disappear, as will the distinction between "black" and "white" markets. Are these things that could have been achieved by "money" and "power" in the past? The invisible shackles have been removed from our bodies. Looking up at the clear sky, the floating clouds seem to smile. Looking back at the world, everyone is celebrating. The world has changed, and people feel several years younger. The future is bright and free.</p>
