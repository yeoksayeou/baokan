<h3 id="c9">金證券與金證券市塲 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行發行金證券，藉以收回通貨而避免通貨膨脹，道是最近金融上一件値得稱道的大事；但是，我們認爲﹐政治上的意義，較諸經濟上的意義有過之而無不及﹐請申論之。</p>
<p>邇來國際戰局﹐急劇變化﹐一部分國民﹐難保不因時局變化而有徬徨之感。而社會經濟之不安定﹐則亦促使人心益趨不安。所以今日爲求安定人心計﹐固然有賴於政治上的努力，但更實際些說，無寗在國民經濟上去找辦法。今日造成國民經濟嚴重之威脅的﹐一爲生產停滯，一爲生活費躍騰。其間關於幣値之貶落，投機者乘機助長其趨勢﹐當屬最主要原因。針對這種現實﹐急謀對策，則如何穩定幣値，收回通貨﹐直接可以抑制投機，刺激生產；間接就可以達到安定人心的目標。這次金證券之發行，目的在收回通貨，在原則上同時可以收獲政治上的成效。</p>
<p>就發行金證券的實情觀察，三日之間﹐發行總額達一百十億元左右﹐將來預定發行第二第三期，則收回通貨數目，自更可觀。所以﹐可說巳收到了初步成續</p>
<p>不過，進一步考察民間經濟枯竭，及社會一般心理，則對於金證券之發行及金證券市塲的籌設，尚有未許過抱樂觀之處﹐不能不希望有關當局稍加注意。就發行金證券及籌設金證券市塲的最高目標而論，如周財長及中儲行木村顧問所宣示，無待吾人　述。就目前金融界及民間實情而論，最急切需要的﹐是如何保證其持有的貨幣價値問題，如果鑒於黃金之狂漲，就認爲一般人都有重金觀念﹐而發行金證券以滿足其慾望﹐未免有削適履之嫌。所以如何穩定幣値，實爲當前根本問題。只要幣値有了保障，黃金價格可不抑而平，那一般物價亦無慮其不平·現在當局旣以金證券之發行及交易爲收回通貨安定金融的手段，就得注意到兩點：　如何勿使金證券在省會上變成一種新的投機籌碼？　如何勿使因金證券交易市塲上的價格上騰而影響中儲券的更趨下跌﹖即如何保持金證券與中儲券的固定聯系？都是今日必須預籌的對策！如果對道兩個問題不速謀妥善對策，則在投機狂有歷史淵源的上海，將來金證券市塲是否能達成當局預定目標﹐或甚至引起相反的結果﹐實未容忽視。</p>
<p>我們詳考今日社會經濟的病徵，深覺一部分不合國情的經濟統治，必須儘速修改﹔而流通於最廣大人民手中的中儲券的價值，必須給與更切實有效的保障。只要這兩點辦到了，成爲「經濟之危機」的產業蕭條與物價暴騰現象﹐就可獲得根本的解救。那時如能再進而扶助中小工業，對生產貸款者實行保本保息辦法等等，就可以使垂危的社會經濟﹐漸呈生色。反之，如果不從道種培本養元的方面﹐多多努力，則其他治標的辦法，縱能收效於一時，亦將不能持久。我們回憶前年當局恢復華股市塲之時，對於證券交易所未嘗不抱着期望，以求誘導游資，振興產業，不調演變至今日，竟獲相反的結果﹐更回憶事變前金子投機交易之惡果，心所謂危，不敢不求當事者善籌預防之術。</p>

<h3 id="c10">鄉建實騐縣——當塗 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 役夫</p>
<p>下午三時半從蕪湖開出的車子，在五時經過積跨姑溪河的大鐵橋﹐未幾即抵當塗站。在鐵路兩旁田間，常見農人忙於耕作，有犂田的，有整地的，有培修田埂的，有牧牛的，麥隴上已長齊了靑色的麥穗，麥稈的根際却轉枯黃了﹐油菜也都結了實，使頂端還　着一些黃色的殘花，這樣便見得非常疏落﹐麥子，油菜之間，不時發見栽培紫雲英的田塊，盛開着鮮艷奪目的紅花，這是當地農民唯一的有效自給肥料。近水的處所，秧田裏長着綫柔鮮綠色的嫩殃。</p>
<p>在姑溪河鐵路橋的西旁，還架設着一座木造的長橋，叫太平橋，在本來還計劃在東側建造一座新式石橋，以備公路汽車通行，可是這工程因戰事擱置，如今只留着椿柱，通过此處的汽車﹐便以那頂太平橋代用。鐵路橋曾遭過一次空襲，幸未命中，姑溪河橫貫縣境，東通丹陽﹐石曰湖，西接大江，貨物由此可以裝運至高淳﹐　水﹐丹陽等地，以至無錫﹐而且灌溉晨田的面積也很廣大﹐實在是這裏交通的農田水利的命脈。</p>
<p>離站不遠﹐有個姑溪公園﹐是當地唯一的娛樂塲所，很奇怪，這裏再也找不到什麽戲院或是別的娛樂塲所了。公園裏面最近在積極整理修葺，面積雖不甚大，水池亭閣﹐花卉樹木布置得楚楚有致﹐中間有個大廳堂﹐最近設了個楫翠茶室﹐除賣茶之外，還備近刋書報雜誌臨時出租。</p>
<p>當塗的商業中心在東街·西街一帶。商店旅館都是帶着幽靜嵐味的本國建築，沒有像蕪湖各大行莊及中國飯店等近代建築，頂多在門面上有一點西洋化。當地地位軍興後因爲運輸綫的變化，才突見重要，商業日見發達。主要商品是當地和附近的農產，如米麥菜子雜糧，濱江河一帶的水產品，以及宣城過來的表芯紙等類。糧食多直接裝運至錫，水產物則經火車裝滬銷售。</p>
<p>農產加工業有油車，碾米廠，酒作（以當地所產大麥製土燒）等幾種。因爲戰後商業的興起，發生了商業金融的需要，才產生了不少行莊。銀錢業和商業都操在客地人的手裏﹐前者鎭江帮居多，後者以無錫帮爲盛。銀行只有安民一家，近已停閉，錢莊約十八家。電燈以燈數及光度爲收費標準﹐爲防止用戶暗中以强光度燈改換認定光度的流弊，在燈上都加了封條。最近因爲煤斤告匱，暫停供電一個月，於是油盞便應時而興。</p>
<p>京蕪線上各地的物價要比京滬線平穩一點﹐五月初在那裏米價每石三萬八千，肉每斤六百餘﹐雞每斤七八百，鴨六七百，香油（即菜油）入百，雞蛋每只四十，鴨蛋五十，荸薺每斤八十元，燒餅油條每件二十元，和南京三十元一件的質量略相等。只有房租一項近頗高昂，普通三五千元一間，押租數萬，無非因爲人口激增，房屋供不應求，兼受一般物價刺激使然。</p>
<p>車票漲了沒有幾天，車子裏的單帮客又恢復了它的盛况，離當塗的那天，到站時間還早，就細細觀察那批利用地域整價，暗地裏做了不少物資流通工作的單帮客，這一天從當塗帶貨上車到京的不下七八十人，或是挽提着籃筐，裝着一，二十隻雞鴨以及蛋類鮮蠶豆等物，或是以袋子裝着些糧食﹐荸薺等類﹐亦有帶菜油，表芯紙的。</p>
<p>一處的治安分外良好，特殊勢力魚肉老百姓的事件不常見到，民間頗現康寗之象。縣長張四朗，事變之初便參加地方自治會的組織，旣而担任警察局長，近又升任縣長，一向就領導着一輩訓練配備精良的警察﹐盡着保境安民的天職。每天早晚兩次總見警察行列在市街經過，執着槍械，唱着軍歌，精神十分飽滿﹐決非普通腦裏整天盤旋着要從檢查旅客弄些外快的可以比擬。</p>
<p>烟·賭·娼的厲禁，是最足代表那裏治績的部分。先說烟吧：對於售吸所方面，取分期勒閉的辦法，逐次的減少設立數額﹔一面又限制售吸所的烟燈數，而且規定營業時間不得過下午九時，經過這一層限制，以晚上營業爲主的烟館業更不易存在了。現今正是限制售吸所設立的最後一期了，不久在當塗將找不到公開吸售鴉片的塲所。皖南本是鴉片的產地，以往行政當局還靠着烟苗捐來兼利公私，但是在這襄近日對於烟苗的剷除辦理得雷厲風行。同時在館子和公共塲所﹐也見着禁種烟苗的標語，其中寫着：「如果我縣長向你們要收烟苗捐，你們老百姓就起來把我打死，處我應得之罪。」娼妓方面，在三十年到三十二年的中間，風癱一時，靑年子弟沉迷四毀滅在此的比比皆是，自從改革新縣政以來，此風大襄，再沒有公開的娼妓和類似娼妓出現了。當塗的賭博在江南頗負盛名，本年歲首尤見風狂，目前因嚴厲禁止，除了家庭娛樂的麻將之外，一切賭博幾已絕跡。</p>
<p>在目前這種物價情勢之下，各都市自然而然的產生了大批乞丐來，但是在這裏除了在車站外面發見遇幾個乞丐外﹐市街上簡直見不到，當地人士說﹕這裏不容許乞丐游民立足。至於處置這些人羣寄生虫的辦法，隨着年齡和其他情形而異，凡高年廢疾的多被招收到救濟院一類的慈善機關裏去，壯年游情的都逼着去做苦役，深染毒物的是一概　逐出境。</p>
<p>最後說到農業吧，田地共有一百餘萬畝﹐現額征數六十三萬餘畝，因爲演江之故，圩田占了全部十分之七。在全省統一政令之下，田賦從去年起開始征收實物。農業增產工作的推動，差不多都由合作的系統主持，不過如若不能把現行增產根本方針加以修正，從農民被動增產轉換到農民自動增產，總恐虛空而鮮具體成效吧。</p>
<p>當塗是在去年被指定爲鄉建實騐縣之一，負着鄉村建設的重大使命，但是鄉建工作在表面上一時還不十分看得出來，最近鄉村建設實施委員會在那裏辦的鄉村建設學校正在積極招收農民，準備開學。</p>
<p>常重雖冠着鄉建實騐縣的名稱，實際上在政治方面也郤有够稱模範縣的資格。</p>

<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週間，殊少顯著變化。國際間歐洲局勢，雖已轉變，然東亞情勢未受顯著影響。且適逢中儲開始發行金證券，游資動向轉移，投資金證券而被吸購，投機給赤·公債·股票買賣減少，而以往市塲買賣黃金之市儈，受金證券低價發行之當頭棒喝，對在暗市購買黃金已乏興味，故黃金黑市週一至週六，始終盤旋於九十關及八十關之間，黑價上落僅有十關之差別，不若前週劇漲暴跌之怪現象。公債亦隨金價穩定，情勢起伏甚微。股票中知美亞，永安公司及紗廠等熱門股市，上半週平靜如股票，漲跌雖互見，參差不一，惟　動仍在範圍以內，漲跌停板之風，較前大爲減少。紋銀及銀元　市，更無生色，銀根固較以前鬆不少，而中儲及銀錢業池備會庫對同業拆放頭寸，仍極審愼，故投機氣氛，逐漸自然平戢，各金融機關現鈔頭寸，得中儲充分調劑，運用已漸自如，對客戶提取現鈔限制，略加寬放，一般小銀行錢莊押放暗息及貼票水率，均已減低不少，整個金融情形，因金證券之發行，歸趨正常穩定。</p>
<p>至工商各業方面，均普遍平靜，刺激物價暴漲之危險牲，似以金證券發行後，自行次第消滅，普以充斥游資已有正當投資途徑。當局取締囤債嚴厲執行，如經濟局强化同業公會健全機構，辦理主要商品登記等種種抑平物價揹置，商民不敢任意囤積物資，一面積極調整供給工業電力，增加生產，及改善運輸交通，疏通物資來源，是以人心安定。最近一週內除米價略見上漲外，其他主要商品，如雜糧油糧煤斤等市價，均趨平定。</p>

<p>— 盧冠六</p>
<p>肺癆病實在是一種最頑強最可怕的病症。沾染了這種病症的人，差不多沒有一個不自認識灰心絕望。可是在這醫學昌明的今日，只要能够早期診斷，從事適當治療，也並不是無可救藥的。</p>
<p>目下這種可怕的病症，正乘着戰時生活艱苦，營養缺乏的機會，在都市裏迅速的蔓延，凡薪水階級的清寒家庭，大都遭受着他無形的威脅。我是服務於教育界的，當然是薪水隘級，不幸內子患了肺病，特把治療的經過，忠實的記述出來，或者對於正被肺癆病菌纏繞着的人們，不無貢獻吧。</p>
<p>內子是一個小學敎員，一方面旣須擔任着學校裏勞苦的課務，一方面又須照顧着家庭裏煩忙的瑣事。因此肺癆病菌就乘虛而入了。在去年秋季偶患傷風咳嗽，漸至發熱不退。經醫生診視，X光檢査，才知道確是結核病症，就請肺癆科醫師治療，因爲進行得很迅速，所以雖然服藥打針，也不見停止，後來發現右肺上角，已有病窩，就住院打空氣針數次，也沒有效果。適有親友介紹，知道上海南洋醫院的外科系主任顧愷峙醫師，切除肋骨，手術高明；經騐豐富，因此就決定投院去求治了。</p>
<p>入院以後，先用X光　影，然後由顧愷時醫師會同肺科專家決定切除的部位和要數。其次又由醫師檢驗大小便，血液和身體各部，是否適於施行手術。開刀前還要仔細消毒打針。因爲事先經過這樣仔細的檢驗，週密的消毒，所以動手術以後，極少有發生病變的。</p>
<p>據說顧醫師在開刀的前夜，常輾轉不睡，仔細研究，詳加籌劃，開刀之時，更全神貫注，神經緊張。並且因爲開刀時，能詳察生理的狀况，所以很少有潑炎。疼痛·發生變化的情形。內子實施第一次手術是在二月二十二日，因爲白天無電，所以要在晚間施行。計切除肋骨四根，在一小時內，手術就已完全吿竣。到深夜病人醒來還在詢問有沒有開刀，因爲施行手術時，要全身麻醉，病人根本不覺得苦痛呢。大約過了三天，漸趨輕鬆，胃口漸復。一星期後，創口就要拆線。但內子因病處在第五根肋骨，所以一月後又須行第二次手術。</p>
<p>第二次手術是在三月三十日晚施行的，計切除肋骨三根。因為第二次切除肋骨的部位。順次而下，所以比每一次便當，費時也短，病人的痛苦，也較第一次為少，第二天已經會飲些流汁的食物，雖然體質較弱，可是一切反應，都較第一次為良好。到滿月時拍X光照診察，可以看到病肺已完全壓縮，病菌已沒有活動的餘地，所以得到醫師的許可，就返家休養了。</p>
<p>出院時因爲費用過大，不勝負擔，又承顧南羣任陸劍崖先生等的帮助，得到醫院方面的特別優待，和救治醫　貸金處的補助，他們對於淸寒敎師同情，都是値得感激的。</p>
<p>現在雖然仍在調養期中，可是比較沒有割治前的情形，已大不相同。因為病症既然不再有進行的現象，病人精神也不再感受威脅，因此精神和體力，當然會很快的恢復了。</p>
<p>這次從內子肺病治療的經過上，使我獲得幾種很寳貴的經騐。首先就是一個人如果有患髮病的嫌疑時，應該迅速去透視檢騐，如果能早期發現，即作適當治療，一定可以迅速治愈的。有許多人很怕檢騐，因爲他恐怕發現了肺病，會使自己精神上感到恐怖，這實在是「養離遺患」的態度，是絕對婪不得的。因爲等到病根已深，再去求治，那末不獨費錢，而且也未免太危險了。</p>
<p>其次如果檢騐後已患肺病，除極輕微的，可以休養治愈外，如果進行較快的，最好即刻去打空氣針，因爲打空氣針旣經濟，又有效。並且沒有什麽苦痛，也絕對沒有危險，實在是治初期。病是簡捷的療法。</p>
<p>至於已有病窩打空氣針而無效的人，那時他只有在靜養和切肋骨二者之中去選擇一種了。但是舊式的靜養療治，本來是一種姑息療治，牠的危險牲實在太大了。因爲當有許多人費了許多時候去靜養反使病根愈深，以至不可救藥的。如果請有經騐的外科醫師，去切除肋骨，牠的危險牲，實在要少得多了。有的人怕開刀時的苦痛，這實在是不必要的。「青蛇　手，壯士斷腕」，對付頑强可怕的結核菌，非抱最大的決心不可。在這醫學進步，一日千里的二十世紀，我們應得要誠懇的相信醫學上的新療法。</p>
<p>「肺病不是絕症」，我很希望一切患有肺癆的人，都能有適當的治療，　獲他們的健康！</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy forces on Okinawa Island continued their attack on the southern region on the 12th, engaging the defending Japanese army in a fierce battle. The Japanese army positions east of Kyozuka, despite repeated intense enemy attacks, are still being secured by the Japanese forces. Furthermore, from dawn to dusk on the 12th, the enemy repeatedly attacked Japanese army positions, but were repelled by the Japanese army. A strong enemy force also attacked the highlands north of the Sawa-Azuchi west of Kyozuka. Approximately 2,000 enemy infantry and 40-50 tanks attacked from the direction of Ameku. On the evening of the 12th, the front-line forces of both armies engaged in fierce battles in the northern areas of Sawa, the northern side of Makabi, and the areas attached to the north of Tomari. In addition, from the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, Japanese special attack forces launched fierce attacks on enemy mobile units in the sea east of Okinawa Island, subsequently sinking and destroying several enemy converted aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the 11th, enemy forces in the southern region of Ryukyu Island, under the cover of air power, have launched a full-scale general offensive. East of Kouchi, the Japanese army is still securing its original positions, shattering the enemy's offensive. West of Kouchi, enemy forces have entered various locations including Kyozuka, the northern highlands of Sawa-Azuchi, and Anza. Japanese army units are currently engaging them in fierce counterattacks. The enemy's first wave of forces, approximately 50-60 tanks and around 2,500 infantry, are being engaged in guerrilla warfare by Japanese army units on the island, causing the enemy to feel extremely distressed. At the same time, the activities of enemy mobile units have gradually subsided. The number of enemy aircraft approaching the archipelago line this week has ranged from a maximum of 400 to a minimum of only 6, indicating that enemy mobile units have retreated far to the southeast, urgently seeking to maintain their strength. The number of converted aircraft carriers, remodeled from large cruisers, is no more than three or four.</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese air units launched fierce attacks on enemy warships in the sea area off Okinawa Island. From the night of the 12th to the morning of the 13th, an unidentified enemy warship was seen burning along the coast, and fires also broke out at enemy northern airfield facilities after being hit.</p>

Their carrier-based aircraft focused their air raids on Southern Kyushu as their primary target. The cumulative number of enemy aircraft attacking before noon reached as many as 600. Japanese air defense units, in addition to intercepting, also launched a thorough and fierce offensive against enemy mobile units.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A new enemy mobile unit, moving north from the sea east of the Nansei Islands, released carrier-based aircraft early on the 13th, aiming for the air bases in the Kyushu region as their primary targets, and launched an attack. The first wave, approximately 80 aircraft, attacked Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Kumamoto prefectures from around 2:00 AM. The second wave, approximately 150 aircraft, similarly attempted to penetrate the southern Kyushu air bases from 8:00 AM. From 2:00 PM to the present, the cumulative number of attacking enemy aircraft has reached as many as 650.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base in Kyushu, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - At dawn on the 13th, enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Kyushu area. Fierce battles are currently underway in that area between the enemy and Japanese air defense units.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - From the Mariana Islands, B-29 aircraft have been attacking the Kyushu area for days, conducting tactical attacks, which remain supplementary in nature. However, since this week, small aircraft departing from Iwo Jima have been attacking in considerable numbers. Furthermore, there are currently about 100 enemy aircraft on Iwo Jima, including several medium-sized aircraft and transport aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Gold Certificates and the Gold Certificate Market <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank is issuing gold certificates to withdraw currency and avoid inflation. This is a noteworthy financial event recently; however, we believe that the political significance outweighs the economic significance. Please elaborate.</p>
<p>In recent times, the international war situation has changed dramatically, and some citizens are inevitably feeling bewildered by the changes. The instability of the social economy has also contributed to increasing public anxiety. Therefore, to stabilize public morale today, it is certainly necessary to rely on political efforts, but more practically speaking, it is essential to find solutions within the national economy. The most serious threats to the national economy today are production stagnation and soaring living costs. Among these, the depreciation of currency, which speculators exploit to exacerbate the trend, is the most important cause. In response to this reality, it is crucial to seek countermeasures urgently, such as stabilizing the currency and withdrawing currency, which can directly curb speculation and stimulate production, and indirectly achieve the goal of stabilizing public morale. The issuance of gold certificates this time aims to withdraw currency and, in principle, can simultaneously achieve political effects.</p>
<p>Judging from the actual situation of the issuance of gold certificates, the total amount issued in three days has reached about 11 billion yuan. With plans to issue a second and third phase in the future, the amount of currency withdrawn will be even more considerable. Therefore, it can be said that preliminary success has already been achieved.</p>
<p>However, upon further examining the economic depletion of the people and the general social psychology, there are reasons not to be overly optimistic about the issuance of gold certificates and the establishment of a gold certificate market. It is important for the relevant authorities to pay close attention to these concerns. Regarding the ultimate goal of issuing gold certificates and establishing a gold certificate market, as stated by Finance Minister Zhou and Advisor Kimura of the Central Reserve Bank, it is unnecessary for us to elaborate. In terms of the current financial sector and the actual situation of the people, the most urgent need is how to guarantee the value of the currency they hold. If, given the rampant rise in gold prices, it is assumed that everyone has a strong concept of valuing gold and gold certificates are issued to satisfy their desires, it may be akin to tailoring shoes to a foot already cut. Therefore, how to stabilize the currency's value is the fundamental problem at hand. As long as the currency's value is guaranteed, gold prices can be stabilized without suppression, and there will be no need to worry about general commodity prices remaining unstable. Now that the authorities are using the issuance and trading of gold certificates as a means to withdraw currency and stabilize finances, they must pay attention to two points:</p>
<p>* How to prevent gold certificates from becoming a new speculative commodity in the provincial capital?</p>
<p>* How to prevent the price increase in the gold certificate trading market from causing a further decline in the value of Central Reserve Bank notes?</p>
<p>That is, how to maintain a fixed relationship between gold certificates and Central Reserve Bank notes? These are all countermeasures that must be planned in advance! If sound countermeasures are not swiftly devised for these two problems, it cannot be ignored whether the gold certificate market in Shanghai, which has a deep historical connection with speculative frenzy, will achieve the authorities' intended goals or even lead to the opposite result.</p>
<p>After carefully examining the symptoms of today's social economy, we deeply feel that some of the economic controls that are incongruous with the national conditions must be revised as soon as possible, and the value of Central Reserve Bank notes circulating among the vast majority of the people must be given more practical and effective guarantees. As long as these two points are handled, the industrial depression and runaway inflation that have become "the economic crisis" can be fundamentally resolved. At that time, if further efforts can be made to support small and medium-sized industries and implement principal and interest guarantees for those who provide production loans, the social economy, which is on the verge of collapse, can gradually show signs of recovery. Conversely, if we do not make more efforts in this area of cultivating the foundation and nourishing the vitality, then other stopgap measures, even if they are effective for a time, will not last. We recall that when the authorities restored the Chinese stock market the year before last, they held expectations for the stock exchange to guide idle funds and revitalize industry, but the evolution to this day has yielded the opposite result. Recalling the disastrous consequences of gold speculation and trading before the incident, we are concerned and cannot but ask those involved to devise sound preventative measures.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Township Construction Experimental County - Dangtu <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Yifu</p>
<p>The car that departed from Wuhu at 3:30 PM passed the large iron bridge spanning the Guxi River at 5:00 PM and soon arrived at Dangtu Station. In the fields on both sides of the railway, farmers were often seen busy with their work, some plowing, some tilling, some repairing field ridges, and some herding cattle. The wheat fields were already covered with green wheat ears, while the roots of the wheat stalks had turned yellow. The rapeseed plants had also formed seed pods, with some yellow withered flowers still attached to the tops, making them appear very sparse. Between the wheat and rapeseed, fields cultivated with milk vetch, blooming with bright red flowers, were often seen. This is the only effective self-sufficient fertilizer available to local farmers. Near the water, the rice paddies were filled with tender green rice seedlings.</p>
<p>Next to the Guxi River railway bridge on the west side, there is also a long wooden bridge called Taiping Bridge. There were plans to build a new-style stone bridge on the east side to allow highway vehicles to pass, but this project was put on hold due to the war. Now, only the pilings remain, and vehicles passing through this area use the old Taiping Bridge as a substitute. The railway bridge has been attacked by air once, but fortunately, it was not hit. The Guxi River runs through the county, connecting to Danyang and Shi Ri Lake in the east and to the Yangtze River in the west. Goods can be transported from here to Gaochun, Lishui, Danyang, and even Wuxi. Moreover, the area irrigated by the river is very large, making it the lifeline of transportation, agriculture, and water conservancy here.</p>
<p>Not far from the station, there is a Guxi Park, the only place of entertainment in the area. Surprisingly, there are no theaters or other places of entertainment to be found here. The park is currently undergoing active renovations. Although the area is not very large, the ponds, pavilions, flowers, and trees are arranged in an orderly and elegant manner. There is a large hall in the middle, which recently housed a Cuicui Teahouse, which, in addition to selling tea, also provides recent books, newspapers, and magazines for temporary rental.</p>
<p>The commercial center of Dangtu is located in the Dong Street and Xi Street area. The shops and inns are all native buildings with a quiet and secluded atmosphere. Unlike the modern buildings of Wuhu's major banks and the China Hotel, there is, at most, a touch of Westernization on the facades. The local area has suddenly become important due to changes in transportation lines after the war, and commerce has developed daily. The main commodities are local and nearby agricultural products, such as rice, wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grains, aquatic products from the riverside area, and Biao Core Paper from Xuancheng. Grain is mostly shipped directly to Wuxi, while aquatic products are transported by train to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>Agricultural processing industries include oil presses, rice mills, and distilleries (using local barley to produce native spirits). Due to the rise of commerce after the war, there arose a need for commercial finance, which led to the emergence of many banks and commercial houses. The banking and commercial sectors are both controlled by people from other places. The former is dominated by the Zhenjiang gang, while the latter is dominated by the Wuxi gang. There is only one Anmin Bank, which has recently been closed. There are about 18 money houses. Electricity is charged based on the number and brightness of lights. To prevent users from secretly replacing lights with stronger ones without reporting it, seals are placed on the lights. Recently, due to a shortage of coal, electricity supply has been suspended for a month, so oil lamps have become popular.</p>
<p>Commodity prices in various places along the Jingwu Line are more stable than those along the Jinghu Line. In early May, the price of rice there was 38,000 yuan per picul, meat was over 600 yuan per catty, chicken was 7-800 yuan per catty, duck was 6-700 yuan per catty, sesame oil (i.e., rapeseed oil) was hundreds of yuan, chicken eggs were 40 yuan each, duck eggs were 50 yuan each, water chestnuts were 80 yuan per catty, and sesame pancakes and fried dough sticks were 20 yuan each, which is roughly equivalent in quality to the 30 yuan pieces in Nanjing. Only rent is quite high recently, with an ordinary room costing 3-5,000 yuan, and the deposit being tens of thousands of yuan, mainly because the population has increased sharply and the supply of housing is unable to meet demand, compounded by the stimulation of general commodity prices.</p>
<p>The ticket prices had only increased a few days before the black marketeers in the car resumed their prosperity. On the day I left Dangtu, I arrived at the station early and carefully observed those black marketeers who made a lot of money through regional price differences and the clandestine flow of goods. On this day, no less than 70-80 people were taking goods from Dangtu to the capital, some carrying baskets filled with 10-20 chickens, ducks, eggs, fresh broad beans, etc., others carrying bags filled with grain, water chestnuts, etc., and some carrying rapeseed oil or Biao Core Paper.</p>
<p>The public security in Dangtu is particularly good, and incidents of special forces oppressing the common people are not commonly seen. The common people live in peace and prosperity. County Magistrate Zhang Silang participated in the organization of the local autonomy association at the beginning of the incident, then served as the director of the police bureau, and has recently been promoted to county magistrate. He has always led a group of well-trained and equipped police officers, fulfilling their duty to protect the territory and ensure the safety of the people. Every day, the police are seen marching through the streets in the morning and evening, holding guns, singing military songs, with high morale, which is by no means comparable to ordinary police officers whose minds are occupied with trying to extract some extra money from inspecting travelers.</p>
<p>The strict prohibition of opium, gambling, and prostitution best represents the achievements of the local administration. First, let's talk about opium: for opium dens, a phased closure method is adopted, gradually reducing the number of establishments. On the one hand, the number of opium lamps in opium dens is restricted, and it is stipulated that business hours cannot exceed 9:00 PM. With this layer of restriction, opium dens that mainly operate at night are even more difficult to exist. Now is the last phase of restricting the establishment of opium dens. Soon, no places openly selling and smoking opium will be found in Dangtu. Southern Anhui is a producing area of opium. In the past, the administrative authorities relied on opium poppy donations to benefit both the public and private sectors, but the eradication of opium poppies has been carried out vigorously in this area recently. At the same time, slogans prohibiting the planting of opium poppies are also seen in restaurants and public places, one of which reads: "If my county magistrate asks you to collect opium poppy donations, you common people should rise up and beat me to death and punish me for what I deserve." Regarding prostitution, it was prevalent from the 30th to the 32nd year of the Republic of China, and countless young people were addicted to it. Since the reform of the new county administration, this trend has greatly subsided, and there are no more open prostitutes or prostitute-like people appearing. Gambling in Dangtu is quite well-known in Jiangnan. It was particularly rampant at the beginning of this year, but due to strict prohibition, all gambling except for family entertainment with mahjong has almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Under the current situation of commodity prices, a large number of beggars naturally arise in various cities, but here, apart from finding a few beggars outside the station, they are simply not seen on the streets. Local people say: Beggars and vagrants are not allowed to stand here. As for the disposal of these parasitic groups, it varies depending on age and other circumstances. Those who are elderly and disabled are mostly recruited into charitable organizations such as relief homes, and young vagrants are forced to do hard labor, while those deeply addicted to drugs are generally expelled from the territory.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about agriculture. There are more than one million mu of cultivated land, and the currently assessed tax is over 630,000 mu. Due to the Yijiang, polder fields account for seven-tenths of the total. Under the unified government orders of the province, land taxes have been collected in kind since last year. The promotion of agricultural production increase is almost entirely managed by the cooperative system, but if the current fundamental policy of production increase cannot be revised to shift from farmers passively increasing production to farmers automatically increasing production, I am always afraid that it will be empty and lack concrete results.</p>
<p>Dangtu was designated as one of the township construction experimental counties last year, shouldering the important mission of rural construction, but the township construction work is not very visible on the surface for the time being. Recently, the Rural Construction School, which is being run by the Rural Construction Implementation Committee there, is actively recruiting farmers and preparing to start school.</p>
<p>Although Dangtu is crowned with the name of a township construction experimental county, it is actually qualified to be called a model county in terms of political affairs.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters correspondent in San Francisco, the Soviet delegation at the San Francisco Conference suddenly presented amendments to the American proposal for a colonial trusteeship system, giving the Soviet Union the power to veto the American plan to establish strategic bases in the Pacific.  According to the American plan, a trusteeship council would be established, and all countries holding trusteeships could attend the council.  The Soviet plan, however, is to amend these regulations so that all permanent members of the world security organization, regardless of whether they hold trusteeships, would have a permanent seat on the council.  In other words, since the United States, Britain, and France already hold trusteeships, the Soviet Union should also have the right to attend the council.  The American plan would allow countries holding trusteeships to request the Security Council to approve their designated strategic base areas, while the Soviet plan would authorize the Security Council to designate the strategic base areas of various countries and insists that the self-determination and independence of the people in all colonies and mandated territories are the only two goals of the trusteeship system.</p>

<h3 id="e31">After the Issuance of Gold Certificates, the Movement Trends of Idle Capital, Financial Markets Gradually Stabilized Last Week <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai have shown little significant change in the past week. Although the international situation in Europe has shifted, East Asia has not been significantly affected. Moreover, coinciding with the Central Bank's commencement of issuing gold certificates, the movement trends of idle capital have shifted, with investment in gold certificates absorbing funds. Speculation in national bonds and stocks has decreased. Furthermore, those merchants previously engaged in trading gold in the market have been dealt a heavy blow by the low-price issuance of gold certificates and have lost interest in purchasing gold on the black market. Therefore, the black market price of gold fluctuated between 90 and 80 yuan from Monday to Saturday, with a difference of only 10 yuan, unlike the previous week's strange phenomenon of dramatic surges and plunges. National bonds have also stabilized along with the price of gold, with minimal fluctuations. Among stocks, popular stocks such as China-America, Wing On Company, and yarn factories saw calm trading during the first half of the week. Although price increases and decreases were mixed and varied, the fluctuations remained within a limited range, and the trend of reaching the daily price limits has significantly decreased compared to before. The silver tael and silver dollar markets were even more lackluster. Although the money market has become significantly looser than before, the Central Bank and the Clearing House for Banks and Money Shops continue to be extremely cautious in lending funds to fellow institutions. Therefore, the speculative atmosphere has gradually subsided naturally. The cash positions of various financial institutions have been adequately regulated by the Central Bank, and their operations have gradually become more flexible. Restrictions on customer withdrawals of cash have been slightly eased, and the interest rates for underground lending and discounting bills by small banks and money shops have been reduced significantly. Overall, the financial situation has trended towards normalcy and stability due to the issuance of gold certificates.</p>
<p>Regarding industry and commerce, conditions have been generally calm. The danger of stimulating a sharp rise in prices seems to have gradually disappeared after the issuance of gold certificates, as abundant idle capital now has a legitimate investment channel. The authorities are strictly enforcing measures to crack down on hoarding, such as strengthening trade associations and improving their structure, and registering major commodities through the Economic Bureau, to suppress prices. Merchants dare not arbitrarily hoard materials. On the other hand, they are actively adjusting the supply of industrial electricity, increasing production, and improving transportation and traffic to unclog the sources of materials. Therefore, people's minds are at ease. In the past week, except for a slight increase in rice prices, the market prices of other major commodities, such as coarse grains, oil grains, and coal, have trended towards stability.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Urgent Need for Coal Supply <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The source of coal in the city has long become a major problem for industrial production. The authorities of the Ministry of Industries are actively coordinating the efforts to unclog the source of coal. According to a reporter's information from mining industry figures yesterday, China has abundant coal resources in many areas. Unfortunately, they have not been fully exploited in the past, so a portion of coal from Annam and India has been used. After the war, due to various reasons, the work in all the major coal mines under development has been intermittent, and the skills of the workers are also relatively different. The insufficient supply of coal is also one of the reasons. In addition, there have been some problems in transportation recently. Coal stored in the production areas is piled up like mountains and cannot be transported out smoothly, which has a significant impact on production and increased production and deserves special attention. If the authorities can find ways to facilitate water and land transportation in North and Central China as soon as possible and further promote mining work, then the coal resources of famous coal mines such as Kailuan, Zhongxing, Huainan, Jingxing, Zhongfu, Mantoushan, and Mentougou can be self-sufficient within the possible savings, and the quantity of military and civilian needs can also be met without worrying about shortages.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Banks and Money Shops Association previously, in order to save manpower and material resources due to the increasing number of negotiable instruments received and paid by fellow institutions, has negotiated a new method for handling mutual collection of negotiable instruments, which was officially implemented from the first of this month. Recently, according to information learned from the financial sector, the Silver Union Association and Qianzhun Bank have now decided on the method of depositing and paying negotiable instruments, which will be implemented within days. The method is roughly as follows: For example, when a money shop receives negotiable instruments of exchange banks and related agent exchange banks deposited by customers, the receiving money shop will directly send them to the Silver Union Association, which will collect the instruments on behalf of the Qianzhun Bank. At the same time, when a bank receives negotiable instruments payable by money shops, the bank will directly send them to the Qianzhun Bank, which will collect the accounts on behalf of the Silver Union Association. Afterwards, the two association banks will reconcile accounts with each other. As for returned instruments, the old method will still be used.</p>

<p>— Lu Guanliu</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is truly one of the most stubborn and terrifying diseases. Those afflicted with this ailment almost universally recognize it as a cause for discouragement and despair. However, in this age of advanced medicine, as long as early diagnosis is possible and appropriate treatment is pursued, it is not beyond cure.</p>
<p>Currently, this dreadful disease is rapidly spreading in cities, taking advantage of the hardships of wartime life and nutritional deficiencies. Most families of the salaried class are facing its invisible threat. As someone who works in the education sector, I am of course among the salaried class. Unfortunately, my wife contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. I am recording the treatment process faithfully, in the hope that it may be of some benefit to those who are currently entangled by tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>My wife is an elementary school teacher. On one hand, she must undertake the laborious teaching duties at school, and on the other hand, she must take care of the busy chores at home. Therefore, tuberculosis bacteria took advantage of the opportunity to invade. Last autumn, she occasionally suffered from a cold and cough, which gradually progressed to a persistent fever. After a doctor's examination and X-ray inspection, it was confirmed that it was indeed tuberculosis. We then sought treatment from a pulmonologist. Because the disease progressed very quickly, medication and injections did not stop its progression. Later, it was discovered that there was already a cavity in the upper corner of her right lung. She was hospitalized and received several air injections, but to no avail. Fortunately, a friend introduced us to Dr. Gu Kaizhi, the head of the surgery department at Shanghai Nanyang Hospital, who was known for his skillful rib resection surgery and rich experience. Therefore, we decided to seek treatment at his hospital.</p>
<p>After being admitted to the hospital, an X-ray was taken first. Then, Dr. Gu Kaizhi, in consultation with a pulmonary specialist, determined the location and number of ribs to be resected. Next, the doctor examined her stool, urine, blood, and all parts of her body to determine if she was suitable for surgery. Thorough disinfection and injections were also required before the operation. Because of such careful pre-operative examination and thorough disinfection, post-operative complications were rare.</p>
<p>It is said that Dr. Gu often tossed and turned in bed the night before surgery, carefully studying and planning in detail. During the operation, he was even more focused and nervous. Furthermore, because he could carefully observe the physiological condition during the operation, inflammation, pain, and unexpected changes rarely occurred. My wife underwent her first surgery on February 22nd. Because there was no electricity during the day, it had to be performed at night. A total of four ribs were resected, and the surgery was completed within an hour. When the patient woke up late at night, she was still asking if the surgery had been performed, because general anesthesia was used during the surgery, and the patient did not feel any pain at all. After about three days, she gradually felt relaxed, and her appetite gradually returned. A week later, the incision was to be stitched up. But because my wife's affected area was at the fifth rib, she had to undergo a second surgery a month later.</p>
<p>The second surgery was performed on the night of March 30th, during which three ribs were resected. Because the location of the second rib resection was sequentially lower, it was more convenient and took less time than the first, and the patient's pain was also less than the first time. The next day, she was already able to drink some liquid foods. Although her physical condition was weaker, all her reactions were better than the first time. A month later, an X-ray examination showed that the diseased lung was completely compressed and the bacteria had no room to move. Therefore, with the doctor's permission, she returned home to recuperate.</p>
<p>When discharged from the hospital, because the expenses were too great and beyond our means, we received help from Mr. Gu Nanqun and Mr. Lu Jianyai, and the hospital provided special treatment and subsidies from the medical loan office. Their sympathy for poor teachers is worthy of gratitude.</p>
<p>Although she is still in the recovery period, her condition is very different from before the surgery. Because the disease no longer shows signs of progressing, and the patient's spirit is no longer threatened, her spirit and physical strength will naturally recover quickly.</p>
<p>This experience of my wife's lung disease treatment has given me several valuable lessons. First of all, if a person has suspected symptoms of the disease, they should quickly go for an X-ray examination. If it can be detected early, appropriate treatment can be given immediately, and it can definitely be cured quickly. Many people are afraid of examinations because they fear that the discovery of lung disease will cause them mental terror. This is truly an attitude of "nurturing a tiger and leaving behind trouble," which is absolutely undesirable. Because if you wait until the disease is deeply rooted before seeking treatment, it will not only cost money, but it will also be too dangerous.</p>
<p>Secondly, if after examination, you have been diagnosed with lung disease, except for very mild cases that can be cured by rest, if the disease is progressing rapidly, it is best to immediately receive air injections, because air injections are both economical and effective. Furthermore, there is no pain and absolutely no danger. It is truly a simple and effective treatment for early-stage diseases.</p>
<p>As for those who already have cavities and air injections are ineffective, then they only have to choose between rest and rib resection. However, the old-fashioned rest cure is originally a palliative treatment, and its dangers are too great. Because there are many people who spend a lot of time resting but make the disease worse, to the point of being incurable. If you hire an experienced surgeon to resect the ribs, the danger is much less. Some people are afraid of the pain of surgery, which is really unnecessary. "When a snake bites, a brave man cuts off his wrist." To deal with stubborn and terrible tuberculosis bacteria, one must have the greatest determination. In this 20th century, where medical progress is advancing by leaps and bounds, we should sincerely believe in new medical treatments.</p>
<p>"Lung disease is not a terminal illness." I sincerely hope that everyone suffering from tuberculosis can receive appropriate treatment and regain their health!</p>
