<h3>日軍機隊急襲冲繩擊沉毀艦船五艘　北中及小祿機塲多處起火</h3>
<p>西南羣島基地三十日中央社電　日軍機隊自二十七日夜起至二十八日晨，對冲繩周圍敵艦船加以攻擊，其後經查明擊沉敵巡洋艦二艘，輸送船一艘。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地三十日中央社電　日軍機隊由二十八日夜至二十九日晨，急襲冲繩本島之北中兩機塲，使其四處起火，小祿機塲亦發生火災，擎沉艦種不詳之敵艦二艘，此外拚撞成功者計四架。</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　據舊金山廣播，美海軍部二十九日發表稱，美軍中型登陸用舟艇L·SM59號，於冲繩海域喪失。又驅潛艇S·S·C52號，因海上事故，於南太平洋喪失。</p>
<h3>日軍生還兩勇士談冲繩血戰情况</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　神直道中佐與森脇弘二大尉兩將校，當冲繩一役奉命實行最後德攻擊之　夜，與戰友袂別，脫出該島，返抵日本國土，此實爲奇賾的生還，頃二勇士會見大本營記者團，暢談在沖繩死戰八十日之情况如次：</p>
<h3>神中佐談話</h3>
<p>冲繩作戰中，敵登陸軍八師　，其中七師團已被我軍殲滅，我牛島部隊之兵力寡少，俊及敵軍幾分之一，我參加在冲繩戰役所痛感者爲皇軍之精銳之個人或部隊，其精强程度，殊値感佩，如前綫某部隊有重傷者數人躺于軍座，其中一人竟自行擊破手榴彈，作壯烈自決，此種哭鬼神之最後情形，充分表顯出我日本陸軍之精銳。該軍隊不問自決者或留得生命繼續抗戰者，到最後爲止不能謂其敗于作戰，本人于六月初出發時，猶不見一人可常作戰敗者。義勇戰鬥隊亦參加衝鋒陷陣，收穫相當戰果，若問此項兵隊所用何種武器，大部重用步槍，于困難情形下，竟拆除本島上搬運甘蔴之鐵軌，用以縛于竹槍之前殺敵。在該島有無兵器不成問題，全體軍民均充滿減敵之氣魄，浴血奮戰。又有一事爲本人從冲繩戰鬥指揮所親眼目睹者，我軍單引擎飛機先後三次以一架擊沉巨型戰艦一艘，廣森中尉指揮之特攻隊，以十架飛機轟沉大型艦十艘，單引擎飛機之成力，不料如此偉大。再該島學生之活躍，亦足令八感奮，尤以冲繩師範及第一中學校，如某」學生隊學友前仆後縱，勇往前進，後繼者踏過學友之屍體，曰：「汝之仇，余必報後」，向前直衝。又冲繩女子師範學校亦如此，彼等學校均能充分協力軍隊作戰，使我等感激不盡。</p>
<h3>森脇大尉談</h3>
<p>敵之戰法並無特定之戰術，大致先用手榴彈猛擲我陣地，然後逐步緊迫，但我陣地受敵砲轟，所　損害甚微，在登陸前，敵艦羣最初離港口五千公尺處發砲，嗣見我方未加應戰，再近至一千公尺地點猛烈轟射，惟我方陣地除有砲車一輛被燬之外，餘無損害，故對來犯之敵可擊退之，惟敵人不分畫夜出動新兵力，雖經我軍日以繼夜，不休不眠，繼續奮戰，然不得已而逐步後退，至最後不得不整理突角陣地，敵之艦砲射擊，于登陸之時過于稠密，不能淸晣辯明每一發砲聲，於登陸後，向日攻擊陣地，夜間轟擊重耍交通路綫，但公路上被擊中者甚少，故雖在敵方砲擊下，仍能自由行動。較砲擊有效者爲巨人型飛機之俯銜轟炸，但時間極短，故少數兵員之行動仍頗不安全，觀察敵人戰法，每一隊之前導機及第二架均屬優良者，第五，六架機能低弱，不能俯衝轟炸，僅能作水平轟炸，我制空部隊可自正面加以射擊，經一陣機槍射擊後，敵機即應嚴隊地。再言敵人坦克東，其弱點在於車上之人員，彼等一遇中彈，速即揭開車頂，躍出而逃，我軍逼近敵坦克車攻擊，每日可擊破其四十輛至五十輛。又敵戰車必由同一之道路前進，故日間描準目標，即可於夜間襲擊之，對戰車攻擊時，以密集火砲最有效，水陸兩用戰車則可以輕機槍擊破之，敵軍亦屬使用火熖放射器，但接近至三十米時，以狙擊方法射倒之，遭遇火熖攻擊時，可以毛布兩方防止。日軍之挺身衝殺，如功之能有充分訓練，必獲成，雨夜更爲良機，</p>
<h3>女學生奮戰</h3>
<p>舉日軍之奮戰一例言之，予曾在數公里之前方，日兵士均赤裸上身，於敵彈　雨下，　開砲向敵猛轟，察其態度沉着，雖間有敵彈於左右落下，發生死傷，毫不顧念。又通信保綫兵亦極勇敢，於敵彈雨下盡其職務，兵器如有缺乏，則就地製造炸彈及手榴彈，即以此手製之優良彈藥攻擊敵陣。反之，敵軍射來之彈丸雖多，但多爲虛發，故日軍之損害極少，冲繩縣民與軍隊共同行動者極多，名護地區之日本人女學校，始則爲軍隊之傷兵看　，最後則與日軍共同作戰至死云。予所目擊者，曾有一女學生於前綫看護傷兵，然渠之聯下已爲敵迫擊砲彈片所重傷，猶不忘自己之任務。又某島一村長曾率領合村男子，爲探尋口軍部隊而渡至另一島嶼，迨抵該島，始悉日軍業已撤收，致該村長倉皇無措，但事已至此，祇得仍返原居之島，抱衝殺敵陣之決心云。日軍部隊本部之煮飯及洗衣工作，均由島民女子前來代作，於敵砲彈橫飛中，菓集靑菜佐餐，或於屍體傍，水池中從事洗濯，此種情况，見之令人麗淚，托何婦女得於最後聲稱，「妾等亦當衝殺敵陳」，各人手持手榴彈不釋。</p>
<h3>艦載機千餘架　昨襲日各地　紀伊半島遭艦砲射擊</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　本月二十六日出動艦載機來襲東海地區以西，中國，四國地方之敵機動隊一部，其後東進，　接近關東南方海面，出動F6F，SB2C，PBF等型艦戰機累計八百八十架，由三十日上午五時半左右，由駿河灣及靜岡地區侵入日本土，連續掃射轟炸關東，甲陵兩地區之飛機塲，軍事設施。敵機一部對福島，神奈川，伊豆半島南部，外房方面之市街地區施行轟炸攻擊。又其他艦載機及由硫黃島基地飛來之P51型累計三百五十架，於是日上午七時半起，以波狀來襲近綫地方，攻擊航空基地，交通機關及船舶。日方迄下午二時判明之戰果，擊落敵機十四架。</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　二十九日下午八時許，敵少數艦艇，曾砲擊濱松之飛機塲，繼於晚十一時三十分至三十日晨零時五分，復對紀伊半島南東部沿岸加以艦砲射擊。</p>
<h3>日陸軍技術者研究砲身成功</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日陸軍技術中佐山本聲等三人，對於機槍。機關砲身腔綫，努力研究其簡單製造法，現已成功，現由日陸軍省授與技附有功賞，已於三十日舉行授與式。按腔錢係刻於砲身內部之渦綫裝置，藉此使子彈廻轉射出，此項工作向來極難，必需用特殊之專用機械及熟練工人，且其能率低下，聞經此次改善方法後，即生手工人亦可製作。</p>
<h3>三馬林達公路上日軍力阻敵前進　五組衝殺隊一齊出擊</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地三十日中央社電　峇厘巴板方而敵軍，於二十日以來開始攻勢，因此雙方激戰復起，日軍守備除於三馬林達公路上，力阻敵軍前進，並施行其得意之衝殺，使敵加重犧牲，並策應日航空部隊之攻擊，致敵陣極呈混亂。尤以二十四日日軍大飼伍長等五組衝殺隊，一齊出擊，是晚於那尼加爾飛機塲附近與敵前哨兵接觸，殲其六名，並衝入於飛機塲背後山地構築陣地之敵軍，殺傷敵兵約五十名。繼於二十五日傍晚，奇襲那尼加爾飛機場北方二十公里之敵陳，殺傷敵約二十名，並佔領該陣地，夜問切斷附近之敵架設電綫，始於二十六日全隊返防。</p>
<h3>新幾內亞日軍夜襲</h3>
<p>前綫基地三十日中央社電　日新幾內亞北岸作戰部隊，於四月二十八日掃蕩馬爾地方之敵軍部隊後，復奪取其機塲及陣地，由五月上旬至中旬，歷經數次急襲機塲，對其周圍之敵軍，予以澈底之打擊後，二十三日夜復對繼續蠢動之敵殘存都隊實施猛烈之夜襲攻學，予敵兵員以相常損害，同時鹵獲糧秣等頗夥。</p>
<h3>烏爾西港發生大爆炸</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地三十日中央社電　日艦艇二十七日黎明起，有十一小時之久，聽聞亞浦島東方之敵基地烏爾西港方面斷續發生大爆炸，未知是否受日潛艇攻擊或敵方之事故，由此炸聲推測，烏爾西方面似有相當損害。</p>
<h3>越北國境日軍反攻</h3>
<p>越南前綫基地三十日中央社電　日軍各地部隊，對越南北部國境附近之渝軍，到處加以反攻，獲有相當戰果。又巴陽地方國境附近之日軍精銳部隊，亦於二十六日夜對該方面敵軍實施果敢肉搏攻擎，將其擊減。</p>

<h3>紀念接收滬租界感想　趙宣傳部長廣播演講</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電三十日爲我國收回上海法租界二週年，宣傳部趙都長特於是日下午八時二十分，在中央廣播電台以「紀念接收上海租界之感想」，對全國廣播演講，茲錄原詞如次：</p>
<p>「在民國三十二年的今天，我國接收了上海法租界，又在同年八月一日，接收上海公共租界，當時本人在上海市政府秘書長任內森與折銜，深感榮幸。今天是我國接收上海法租界及公共租界的二週年，本人現在藉廣播的機會，向全國同胞們發表一點感想。回想民國三十二年六月三十日，盟邦日本與我國訂定八月一日實施交還上海公共租界的時候，汪故主席曾發表談話誰：「最善之努力，進而與法國商洽，務使上海法租界之交還，最遲於本年人月一日以前得以實現」。以後中法當局即於同年七月二十二日在首都簽訂正式交還上海法租界之協定，訂定於同年七月三十日爲交還之期，於是在全國人民熱烈期待中，這可紀念可慶祝的日子終於到來。在民國三十二年的今天，法當局正式將上海法租界交還我國，而「法租界」這三個字，也就從那天起，在我國外交上永遠成爲一個歷史上的名詞了。</p>
<h3>百年來光榮一頁</h3>
<p>當我國剛剛接收了上海法租界，又在那年八月一日接收了上海公共租界，這可以說是我國百年來最光榮的兩件大事。我國自從上海有了租界之後，就領土分裂，主權殘缺，因爲租界的意義，在國際法上呌做「國中有國」，而治外法權的意義，在國際法中呌做「領土之延長」，所以我國一天有租界和治外法權的存在，我國領土主權就一天無法完整，一切政治經濟受了「國中有國」的影響，也受了「領土之延長」的牽掣。可是從民國三十二年七月三十日以來，租界和治外法權在我國同時消滅，我國的領土和主權也同時趨於完整。到現在想來，我國之接收上海法租界和公共租界，豈不是我國百年來最光榮的兩件大事麼？</p>
<p>可長這光榮的兩件大事，如果不是盟邦日本仗義盡力的來協助，當然不會這麼容易就實現的，所以我們不僅感激日本，尤其要深灤了解日本協助我國完成自由獨立的盛意。本人爲喚起全國同胞試進一步的認識，願就史實方面簡略的說一說。</p>
<h3>檢討過去策勵將來</h3>
<p>回憶百年以前，我國因氣絕鴉片進口，與英國發生戰爭，結果戰敗，被逼簽訂城下之盟，遂種下了上海開闢租界的禍根，百年以來，我國受盡了租界的毒害，舉國上下一致迫切要求收回，而數十年來的國民革命，也以租界之收回爲其主耍目的之一，可是國民革命終因未能澈底遵循國父大亞洲主義之遺敎，所以非但孤立無助，且在東亞民族之中，發生了關牆之爭，而將國力大份消耗在無謂的衝突裏面，於是英美的勢力才能够繼續蟠據我國，而上海的租界亦在英美的統制下，無從收回。事變以後汪故主席領導和平運動，使中日關係恢復本來應有之面目，我國願協力日本以建設東亞，日本更願支援我國的自由解放，日本這種偉大的道義精神與需要的事實，協助我國把租界收回，對此我們應該有深切的認識。</p>
<h3>國父遺教切實遵行</h3>
<p>一在距離接收上海租界已經兩週年了，可是本人所感到的問題，是應該怎樣把國家建設起來復興起來，於是就先應該檢討過去，過去我國復興建設工作這所以遲遲不能見功，固是因爲受了「國中之國」的影響，可是我國過去內部的不統一，以致軍閥橫行，共黨作亂，也是我國復興建設大業難以完成的主因。所以在今日，我們一面在慶祝這光榮的日子，一面還要剷除過去的禍根，爲將來開闢一條建國的大道。欲達此目的，全國同胞除了澈底信奉三民主義，別無他途可循。而且全國同胞更要知道國父手訂的三民主義，不同於其他任何主義，三民主義是純粹根據我國的歷史和地理的環境，精心研究而成的，其他的任何主義，在別的國度裏也許適合，然而運用到中國來，就有許多格格不入的地方，因而決不足以解決中國問題。三民主義是救國主義，道句話在少數缺乏自信力的人聽來，也許是空洞的，然而事實可以證明，今日眞正能够救中國於危亡者，還是三民主義，沒有三民主義作我國民革命的指導原則，國民革命是盲目的，沒有三民主義做建國的指導原則，建國亦是不成功的。</p>
<p>我國雖然承盟邦日本的協助，走上了獨立和自主之途，可是今後怎樣才能確保獨立和自主，以及怎樣才能建立一富强的國家，幷聯合世界上以平等待我這民族，其同維持世界和平，也就不言自明，就是要澈底信奉三民主義，確保三民主義。三民主義全部實現的時候，就是中國眞正得救而安如磐石的時候。</p>
<h3>全國奮起應付危機</h3>
<p>然而在時局嚴重的今日，實在是我國爭取復興的緊要關頭，全國同胞要時時牢記陳代主席所昭示我們的話，無論任何國家想要圖存，想要復興，最靠得住的辦法是靠自巴。又說吾人爲求解放，爲求國家之真正獨立自由，不祗需要忍耐，更應需要團結，不祗需要沉毅，更應需要邁進。中國危機現正四伏，茍不努力則淪爲全面之赤化，或則再淪爲英美之殖民地，如是則國民政府數年以來所努力取消不平等條約，收回租界，撤廢治外法權等成果，一一敗於旣成，故全國人民正應即時奮起，要求全面和平，舉全國總力以根絕赤禍，以排除在華之英美勢力，希望全國同胞恪遵勵行，以通過難關步上復興。</p>
<p>所以我們在今天紀念接收上海租界，一面感對百年來的光榮，一面更耍檢討自已，鞭策自己，奉行國策，肅正思想，保障治安，增加生產，恪遵陳代主席所訓示我們的各點繼續努力，使這百年來的光榮發揚光大，給國家爭取更光榮的成果，和更偉大的建樹。</p>

<p>去年五月間，本市市民福利協會，爲協助當局提高並改善警察待遇，設置警察消費合作社，籌借資金一萬萬元，由該會分向各業公會及熱心人士商請整借，是爲官民協力其體表現之始。當時本報社評曾屢次申論其意義，並向各界呼籲墊借資金。其後各業公會及個人間熱心實助者固多，而始終觀望敷衍者亦復不少，以致遷延數月未能如數熱足，僅及十分之四。於此一端，可以表示大部分有財力市民，對於公益心之淡薄。反之，公益心淡薄者必然重視私利，奔競追逐，無非爲一已暴利，於是社會上充滿投機囤積，居奇取巧之風，近年以來，惟有上海社會最爲混亂，絕非偶然。當時以爲墊借資金等於捐款，現在已經當局允准如數償還本利，今日開始發給。而歷來官塲舊習，前任帳目後任大率推諉不認，今當局遵守信用，殊足欽佩。同時，對於過去一般吝嗇之輩，認爲借款即爲捐款者，可以給予明白啓示。</p>
<p>不久以前，市府發行臨時救濟庫券，其中三分之一也分請各業公會及熱心人土認購，是項庫券，顧各思義，當爲公益用途無疑。可是，公會之中仍有一部分認而未緻或緻未足額者，雖經一再展期，仍遷延不繳，殊爲遺憾。按救濟庫券中原有二萬萬元指撥空襲救濟經費，而目前救災迫切，需款正股，對於未繳足額之救濟庫券一萬三千萬元，已由市民福利協會理事長聞關亭，副理事長李思浩兩氏先行設法籌墊。希望尙未緻足之各業公會不再遲延，在限期內從速繳齊。况且，認購救濟庫券，將來本利均可收回（第一期業已公吿發息），與捐款性質不同。目前捐款救災者，尙極踴躍，則認購救濟庫券，旣能救濟災民，復可本利收回。我們相信尙未緻足各公會必能勉力以赴，共襄善舉。</p>
<p>最近因空襲受災傷亡難民，流離痛苦，無不同情，民間正協助當局辦理救濟救護工作，無論救濟救護，均須大量經費，除政府指撥以外，尤盼民間人士自動捐助，本報代收捐款，句日之間，數目雖不算大，而捐款者單位極多，頗見踴躍。但捐款者雖極踴躍，爲什麼捐款總數却並不算多呢？因爲捐款者還是偏於資力較低的，所以數目不大。可是，我們不相信資力較高的，其熱心公益落後於人，所以，我們竭誠希望一般當商巨賈發揮同情心，也能踴躍輸捐，那末，捐款的總數就能迅速上昇。目前據空襲救濟委員會的估計，救災經費第一期需要二十萬萬元，除去政府指撥及已收到捐款外，尙差半數以上，假定以十萬萬元計算，分爲一百單位，每單位一千萬元，每一富商認捐一單位，則一百位富商即可解決。據我們估計，偌大上海，出其萬分之一及千分之一的財富即可認捐一單位者，何止千百人，那末，只須富人大發慈悲，受災難民就可得救了。爲富行仁，其各勉之。</p>
<p>上面所說的，我們無非昐望市民中當有人士共同熱心社會公益。最後，我們對於爲空襲担任救災的工作人員，如消防，防空，警察，保甲人員等等，因搶救工作而致喪生或殘廢者，除政府予以撫恤金外，民問也應特別酬恤。市民福利會空襲救濟委員會主張以第二期捐款充實消防及防空經費，我們認爲應提出一部分作爲因公致受傷亡者之撫慰金，以爲民間的一種公道的表示。</p>
<h3>印度洋戰機漸熟日精銳嚴重監視東瓜以南敵補給路切斷</h3>
<p>印度洋基地三十日中央社電　本月二十五日出現於南部泰領浦開特島四周海域之敵機動部隊，現繼續蠢動，但遭該地日軍部隊猛烈反攻，阻止敵軍登陸，復於二十六日夜遭日特攻機之猛攻，被轟沉巡洋艦及大型艦各一艘，終至週出日軍攻擊圈外。最近敵方公布稱，英國東印度艦隊，係以伊麗莎白皇后號·雷納溫號及法戰艦列仙號三戰艦爲基幹，外加巡洋艦七艘，驅逐艦十四艘所編成。此外，綜合各方情報，現在印度洋上有快速空母七·八艘，此次蠢動之敵艦隊，當係其一部。此次敵之來襲企圖，一爲偵察南岸地區之威力，二爲解除緬甸反攻之困難，施行　制作戰。敵方焦欲反攻馬來，乃偵察南岸地區之日軍防衛陣、並圖解除緬甸之東瓜·巴古方面之苦戰及日軍以喜丹河爲中心之猛烈反攻，日陸·海·空軍精銳刻對於敵之行動嚴重監視，充分具有擊滅敵業攻之自信。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫基地三十日中央社電　據守庇古猶　山脈之日軍精銳，始終堅守陣地，阻遏敵軍主務，同時襲擊仰光，普羅姆公路之雨大補給動脈，牽制敵軍需物資之運輸。此次渡過善丹河，展開巧妙之浸透作戰，確保尼卡依·苗邱二要塞，策應西進部隊，整理挾擊體制，爲重創喜丹河盆地一帶之敵軍，開始東進，於東瓜以南之緬甸公路上，隨處切斷敵之補給路，使敵犧牲加重，敵乃於東瓜北方十五公里地點，自行炸燬於運輸上必需之橋樑，極呈混亂狀態，如是敵爲挽固戰勢，已有多大之犧牲，使第十五師團避退，新配置第七師團，幷傾其空軍勢力協助作戰。又於莫基西方地區對抗敵機甲師團之日軍部隊，木月十六日以來，轉取攻勢，於塔庫埃特河强行渡河成功，刻對敵重要據點攻擊中。</p>
<h3>明日復興節　國府將舉行紀念典禮</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　八月一日爲我國第二屆復興節，回憶國府遷都後，由於最高當局之不斷努力，並承盟邦日本之眞誠協力，遂於三十二年七月三十日及八月一日，先後將百年來列强據爲根據地，榨取東亞之上海等地租界全部收回，使吾國家主權重復完整，此實爲國民革命劃時代之盛舉。政府當局爰特定八月一日爲復興節，今第二屆已吿來臨，國府當局爲紀念此在我國復興史上具有莫大意義之一日，特定於是日上午九時在國府大禮堂隆重舉行紀念典禮，同時全國各省市小均分別展開紀念行事。</p>
<h3>任省長撥款賑濟滬災黎</h3>
<p>蘇州三十日中央社電　美機日前連續盲炸滬市，受害災民亟待救濟，前已由蘇社會熱心人士捐募賑款五千萬元，茲任省長鑒於滬市災黎甚衆，特飭財政　撥款一千萬元，一併滙滬，俾資救濟。</p>
<h3>蘇北計劃趕修運堤</h3>
<p>揚州三十日中央社電　蘇北運堤，自事變以還，因受軍事上之影響，致遭損壞，雖經水利當局隨時注意修補，然其地形特殊，且新四軍出沒其間，又多爲之破壞，不易即時修復，近來洪水水勢暴漲，將所築之欄河大壩冲決，致大最蓄水與洪水奔騰而下，運堤下游勢將蒙受重大損害，蘇北運河工程處頃已擬訂三十四年度防汛計劃，果報蘇北綏署鑒核辦理，以期及時防修，免遭水患。</p>
<h3>浙省整頓水路交通</h3>
<p>杭州三十日中央社電　浙省水路交通，因戰亂頻起，航行阻滯，其於交通運輪及地方繁榮各方面之影響，至深且鉅，了省長有鑒於此，爰根據省諮詢委會之建議，飭令有關機關着于整理滬杭，蘇嘉，紹蕭，杭餘，杭富等五航綫，並令飭利濟公司負責辦理各綫航運事宜，浙省交通，行將愈趨圓滑之途。</p>
<h3>縣警施行學校訓練</h3>
<p>杭州三十日中央社電　浙省府爲强化各縣警察隊及統一組織，經擬訂各縣警察訓練規則，通令各縣對警察施以各項技術學科之訓練，以便提高一般素質，養成爲保衛地方之勁旅。</p>
<h3>杭州準備採辦食糧</h3>
<p>杭州三十日中央社電　省諮詢委會爲防止靑黃不接期間之米價上漲，特擬具方案，一面策動商民採辦麵粉，以應急需，一面籌集巨款，令飭市府會同市商會組織採辦機構，進行採辦工作，呈請省府批准後，即將開始各項工作。</p>
<h3>波次坦會談　即將告結束　討論詳細內容無從探悉</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電　據柏秣英方記者報吿：波次坦會談之終結已在目前，刻下雖無官方蹬實之消息，然柏林各消息靈通界深信，一切在會談中所討論之事項，將於週二或週三均吿完畢，同時關於在最後會談時所需要發表之言詞，亦有早已擬定之可能。會談於昨日正進行中，且有圓滿之成績，惟關於三國巨頭所討論之詳細內容，實無從探悉。三巨頭已作十二次之會談，然在每次均無絲毫有關會談之真切內容透露。此次英美渝三國對日共同宣言，實與三顯會議無關，蓋蘇聯不欲向日本宜戰，若欲預曾在會談終結時，必將有一關於亞洲戰事之公報發表，亦無有力之根據。此次會談之議題，並不涉及軍事方面，茲據蘇聯某共黨機關報載稱，「德國之將來，實係波次坦會談之主要議題。」據倫敦星期報外交訪員著稱，英新任首相阿特里與外相貝文，均以勞工黨政府甫吿建立，未便對會議中各項主要間題之決定有所參議，故或將要求特魯曼史太林二氏允許關於其他各項主要問題，可延至下半年再度開會商討。</p>
<h3>社福部灌製國民操法唱片</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　社會福利部前爲使一般民衆便於鍛鍊體格，曾創製國民閒易體操法，茲爲使各地均能不時操練起見，轉聘專家灌製大批操法唱片，擬於最短期內分送各地電台廣播，俾民衆依法操練，增强體格。</p>
<h3>英美國內厭戰情緒</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電英勞工黨大勝之消息傳出後，各方人士均有意外之感，然而由於歐戰結束及世界戰爭業臨最後階段之刻下情勢觀之，此種現象實亦不足驚異。蓋因英國國民感受六年作戰之痛苦，奈倦已極，而在戰爭期間之英國民，其能期望之目的，而所翹望者，不外爲如何再建個人之安全生活而已。是以墨守大英帝國主義之保守黨邱吉爾，當遠不及倡言安定民生·解決住宅問題·保證獲得職業之勞工黨富有魅力。總而言之，英國國民此次之投票，並非以邱吉爾爲對象，亦非以阿特里爲對象，實對安定生活之勞工黨政綱而投者也。由此可察知英國民之關心憂慮戰爭拖延不已，且英軍皆不欲出征於東亞，亦係事實。此次總選投票，前綫之兵士約達七成以上，皆對保障戰後職業之勞工黨投票，又爲極堪注目之現象。至美國方面，其對實現和平之渴望，亦不亞於英國，深望軍需化爲民需之氣勢，尤其顯著。美國最近之食糧飢饉，尤使一般）眾深爲爲滿，當接到冲繩美軍犧牲重大消息之美民，對於爲爭取一小孤島，而出動太平洋艦隊之主力，與調遣大批之陸軍兵力，以及費三個月之時間，實有得不償失之嘆，以致惹起尼米資之責任問題。最近美國內又揭露對日和平條件之論調，其原因唯在急於結束東亞戰爭也。故此，英·美兩國政府鑒於國內和平氣勢一致澎湃，遂亦不得不急謀對策，以迴避其流血犧牲，二十八日三國對日共同宣言之發表，亦即國內企求之反應也。</p>
<h3>英新國會延期召集</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電　據倫敦訊：英新國會召開之期，業已決定延至八月十五日，英王將於該日發表演說。</p>
<h3>莫立遜代　英首相職務</h3>

<h3>德軍五年作戰喪失逾四百萬</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電據柏林英記者宣稱：日前在德國最高司令部宣傳運動總指抓倫納克將軍官邸，搜出一極重要之秘密文件，內詳記自一九三九年九月一日起至一九四四年十一月三十日止之德軍損害如次</p>
<p>德軍損害總數爲四。○六四·四三八名，其中殞命者一·九一一·三○○名，失者蹤一·四三五·八五三名，被俘者二七八·二○一名，其三者數目顯與總數不符，然其三者之數並非包括上年十一月至今年五月之德軍損害數在內。同時該秘密文件中復載，在去年十一月中有七七四·一四八名受傷之德軍，尙在醫院中養病。又德國國境前綫作戰時，德軍被聯合軍方面以飛機炸死者六四·○○○名，失蹤者一·○○○名，又因違犯軍律而被處死者約九·○○○名。</p>
<h3>英第八軍奉令解散</h3>
<p>百倫三十日中央社電　據此間獲悉：羅馬方面發出官方消息謂，昨日上午十時英國第八軍已正式奉命解散。按該軍曾于北非·西西里·及義大利大陸作戰。</p>
<h3>貝當繼續受審　牽涉賴伐爾　各見證人陳述供詞</h3>
<p>百倫三十日中央社電　據巴黎訊：貝當元首之審訊於今日很始，各見證人之供詞中，頗多涉及前維希首長賴伐爾者，而賴伐爾目前尙在西班牙，未能即刻至法庭受審。據前駐法國威斯巴登對德停戰協議委會主席杜恩聲稱，「賴伐爾實一卑賤之敗德者」。又據勃魯姆聲稱，「玩維希政權之把戲者賴伐爾也」。又據洛克斯聲稱，「賴伐爾曾盡其最大努力，促使英法不睦」。又據一名女見證人（現年三十五歲，名丹尼絲·貝蒂特，至一九四一年止爲巴黎某義大利報館內某指導員之女秘書）供稱：「賴伐爾之用意，欲使法·德·義·西四國聯盟而代替現在之聯合國」。現賴伐爾被拘禁於巴塞洛納之門特求易森林地，按賴氏於德國瓦解時，即住居於該地，據稱賴伐爾自法國當局拒絕保護渠之安全時，即至西班牙向西當局要求保護，俾能在貝當受審時可不至巴黎同時受審</p>

<p>11當局深盼市民　協助整理交通　每星期三定爲交通安全日00</p>
<p>市警察局爲整理全市各區交通秩序，提高市民交通道德，澈底遵守規則，以減少交通事故起見，特聯合盟邦軍當局及保甲人員，於二十五日起至三十一日一週間，實施交通整理强化週，由於軍警市民各方之協力，成績尙稱良好。市警局第二處因鑒於今日爲交通整理週最後一天，特於昨日下午三時，假　局七樓俱樂部，招待本市新聞界舉行座談會。第二處平岡處長因公未克參加，由小林警察總隊長代表出席，並到交通科長陳書同，副科長吉野榮及各報記者十餘人。</p>

<p>席間由小林隊畏代表平岡處長致詞，略謂：本市市內交通狀况，因各項車輛增加，以及駕駛員車夫與一般市民對現行交通管理規則，視同具文，爭先恐後，致陷八無道德無秩序之狀態，一旦非常事態發生，不免因此增加交通事故及市民傷害情事。故藉此次公佈陸上交通管理規則之機會，實施整理强化週，以提高人民對交通管制之認識。回顧一週以米，在盟邦陸海軍當局，警察隊當局以及保甲人員之積極協力下，成績尙稱良好，惟仍未達吾人理想之目的。本週間實施之重點，爲嚴守左側通行與絕對服從交通指揮信號初步事項。一週以來，經軍警人員熱心服務，在各馬路間整理交通，惟一般來往行人，仍不注意指揮燈信號，以及駕駛員在超越停止綫外停車，行人任意續越馬路等情，未能出力協助，此種情形，殊易引起事故發生，致秩序混亂，深盼市民能爲自巴安全與他人安全計，積極協助整理交通，達到安全交通之目的。同時今後規定每星期三爲交通安全日，仍對不守秩序之車輛行人嚴加取締，盼各界人士注意幷協力。</p>
<h3>交通科長報告</h3>
<p>旋由交通科長報吿本市事輛情形，略稱：目前本市機動車輛較五年前減少五千餘輛，卡車減少一千六百輛，但如人力軍·三輪車·自由車等反蛟前大爲增加，達九千輛之多，且因各區合併，行駛區域集中，故除實施訓練交通警察外，并提高其水準及配備。</p>
<p>又據吉　副科長報告，交通警察在數量上固較前減少，刻正設法提高其素質，一面恢復吹嗚警笛。同時交通科正與建設局方面接洽，在各馬路繪製非常明顯之交通標準識，以利交通。</p>
<p>最後由各報記者就恢復狹小馬路之單程交通，嚴格取締二人搭乘自由專，以及人行道攤販等問題提出討論，由交通科方而詳予調查後，進行改善。懇談至五時許始　。</p>

<h3>大富翁一念之善　苦學生破涕爲笑　助金差額尙遠盼連輸將</h3>
<p>近一月來，本處同人辦理助學方面一切手續，大致就緒；三千六百餘舊生，加上三千多新生，檢閱各校各級學生的登記名冊，一本本，一行行，確是洋洋乎大觀。這許多後生可界的靑年，將來一定有不少是可造之材，是建設新中國的棟樑。所可惜，他們目前盡是家貧如洗的苦孩子，遭遇了八年的戰爭，受着高物價的壓迫，以致生活環境無法應付，簡直喘不過氣來，這是多麼可憐可痛的事！</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Fleet Attacks Okinawa, Sinking and Destroying Five Ships; Fires Break Out in Multiple Locations at Northern, Central, and Oroku Airfields</h3>
<p>Southwest Islands Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From the night of the 27th to the morning of the 28th, Japanese aircraft fleets attacked enemy ships around Okinawa. Subsequent investigations confirmed the sinking of two enemy cruisers and one transport ship.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From the night of the 28th to the morning of the 29th, Japanese aircraft fleets launched a surprise attack on the northern and central airfields of Okinawa Island, causing fires to break out in multiple locations. A fire also broke out at Oroku Airfield. Two enemy ships of unspecified type were sunk. In addition, four ramming attacks were successful.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a San Francisco broadcast, the US Navy Department announced on the 29th that the US medium landing craft L·SM59 was lost in the waters off Okinawa. Additionally, the submarine chaser S·S·C52 was lost in the South Pacific due to a maritime accident.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers, Survivors, Discuss the Bloody Battle of Okinawa</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Lieutenant Colonel Naomichi Kami and Captain Hiroji Moriwaki, two officers who were ordered to carry out the final special attack during the Battle of Okinawa, bid farewell to their comrades on the night of the attack, escaped from the island, and returned to the Japanese mainland. This is truly a miraculous survival. Recently, the two brave soldiers met with a group of reporters from Imperial General Headquarters to discuss their experiences fighting to the death for eighty days in Okinawa, as follows:</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Kami's Account</h3>
<p>During the Okinawa operation, the enemy landed eight divisions, of which seven have already been annihilated by our forces. The strength of my Ushijima unit was small, only a fraction of that of the enemy. What I deeply felt during my participation in the Battle of Okinawa was that the elite individuals and units of the Imperial Army were truly admirable in their strength. For example, in a certain unit at the front line, several severely wounded soldiers were lying at the regimental headquarters. One of them detonated a hand grenade himself, making a heroic self-sacrifice. This kind of heartbreaking scene fully demonstrated the elite nature of the Japanese Army. Whether they chose self-sacrifice or continued to fight for their lives, to the very end, they could not be said to have been defeated in battle. When I left in early June, I did not see a single person who could be considered to have been defeated. Volunteer combat teams also participated in assaults, achieving considerable results. When asked what kind of weapons these troops used, most of them relied heavily on rifles. In difficult situations, they even dismantled the rails used to transport sugarcane on the island and used them to attach to the front of bamboo spears to kill enemies. Whether or not there were weapons on the island was not the issue. All the soldiers and civilians were filled with the spirit of reducing the enemy and fought bloody battles. Furthermore, I personally witnessed something at the Okinawa battle command post. Our single-engine aircraft sank a large battleship three times in a row. The special attack unit led by Lieutenant Hiromori sank ten large ships with ten aircraft. The effectiveness of single-engine aircraft was unexpectedly great. Furthermore, the activity of the students on the island was also inspiring. In particular, the Okinawa Normal School and the First Middle School, for example, a student team bravely advanced one after another, with those following treading over the bodies of their comrades, saying, "I will avenge you!" and charging straight ahead. The Okinawa Women's Normal School was also similar. These schools were able to fully cooperate with the military in combat, which made us extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Captain Moriwaki's Account</h3>
<p>The enemy's tactics did not have a specific strategy. Generally, they would first bombard our positions with hand grenades, then gradually close in. However, our positions suffered very little damage from enemy artillery fire. Before landing, the enemy fleet initially fired from 5,000 meters from the harbor. Seeing that we did not respond, they then approached to 1,000 meters and fired heavily. However, apart from one artillery vehicle being destroyed, our positions suffered no other damage. Therefore, the invading enemy could be repelled. However, the enemy deployed new troops day and night. Although our troops fought continuously day and night without rest, they were forced to retreat gradually. In the end, we had no choice but to consolidate our protruding defense lines. The enemy's naval artillery fire was too dense during the landing to clearly distinguish each shot. After landing, they attacked our positions during the day and bombarded important transportation routes at night. However, very few were hit on the highway, so we were still able to move freely even under enemy fire. More effective than artillery fire was the dive-bombing by giant aircraft, but the time was extremely short, so the movement of a small number of soldiers was still quite unsafe. Observing the enemy's tactics, the lead and second aircraft of each squadron were excellent, while the fifth and sixth aircraft had weak performance and could not dive-bomb, only carrying out horizontal bombing. Our air defense units could shoot at them from the front. After a burst of machine gun fire, the enemy aircraft would respond in formation. Furthermore, regarding enemy tanks, their weakness lay in the personnel on board. As soon as they were hit, they would quickly open the top of the vehicle and jump out to escape. Our troops approached enemy tanks and attacked them, destroying 40 to 50 vehicles every day. Furthermore, enemy tanks always advanced on the same road, so we could aim during the day and attack them at night. When attacking tanks, concentrated artillery fire was most effective. Amphibious tanks could be destroyed with light machine guns. The enemy also used flamethrowers, but we would snipe them down when they approached within 30 meters. When encountering flamethrower attacks, two layers of woolen cloth could be used for protection. Japanese troops trained to charge and kill, if they have sufficient training, will surely be successful, especially on rainy nights.</p>
<h3>Female Students Fight Bravely</h3>
<p>To give an example of the bravery of the Japanese soldiers, I once saw soldiers stripped to the waist a few kilometers ahead, opening fire on the enemy under a rain of enemy bullets. Their attitude was calm. Although enemy bullets occasionally fell to the left and right, causing casualties, they did not care. Furthermore, the communication line maintenance soldiers were also extremely brave, fulfilling their duties under a rain of enemy bullets. If weapons were lacking, they would manufacture bombs and hand grenades on the spot and use these self-made, excellent munitions to attack enemy positions. Conversely, although the enemy fired many bullets, most of them were wasted, so the damage to the Japanese troops was minimal. Many residents of Okinawa Prefecture acted together with the military. The Japanese Girls' School in the Nago area initially cared for wounded soldiers in the military and eventually fought to the death alongside the Japanese army. I witnessed a female student caring for wounded soldiers at the front line, but her lower limbs were severely injured by enemy mortar shrapnel. However, she did not forget her duty. Furthermore, a village head on a certain island led all the men in his village to cross over to another island to search for the military unit. When they arrived on the island, they learned that the Japanese army had already withdrawn, causing the village head to panic. However, since things had already come to this, they had no choice but to return to their original island, determined to charge and kill the enemy. The cooking and laundry work for the headquarters of the Japanese army units was done by local women, who gathered green vegetables to supplement their meals amidst flying enemy shells or washed clothes in pools of water next to corpses. Seeing this situation brought tears to one's eyes. Finally, the women declared, "We will also charge and kill the enemy," each holding a hand grenade.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Carrier-Based Aircraft Attacked Various Parts of Japan Yesterday; Kii Peninsula Attacked by Naval Gunfire</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A portion of the enemy mobile fleet that dispatched carrier-based aircraft to attack the area west of the Tokai region and the Chugoku and Shikoku regions on the 26th of this month later moved east, approaching the sea south of Kanto. A total of 880 F6F, SB2C, PBF, and other types of carrier-based fighter aircraft invaded Japan from the Suruga Bay and Shizuoka areas around 5:30 AM on the 30th, continuously strafing and bombing airfields and military facilities in the Kanto and Koryo regions. A portion of the enemy aircraft carried out bombing attacks on urban areas in Fukushima, Kanagawa, the southern Izu Peninsula, and the outer Boso Peninsula. In addition, a total of 350 other carrier-based aircraft and P51-type aircraft flying from the Iwo Jima base attacked areas near the front line in waves from 7:30 AM, attacking air bases, transportation facilities, and ships. As of 2:00 PM, the Japanese side had confirmed the destruction of 14 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At around 8:00 PM on the 29th, a small number of enemy ships shelled the Hamamatsu airfield. Subsequently, from 11:30 PM to 12:05 AM on the 30th, they again carried out naval gunfire attacks on the southeastern coast of the Kii Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Technicians Successfully Research Gun Barrel</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Army Technician Lieutenant Colonel Seiichi Yamamoto and two others have been working hard to research a simple manufacturing method for the rifling of machine guns and automatic cannon barrels. They have now succeeded, and the Japanese Army Ministry has awarded them a meritorious service award, which was held on the 30th. The rifling is a spiral groove installed inside the barrel, which causes the bullet to rotate as it is fired. This work has always been extremely difficult, requiring special dedicated machinery and skilled workers, and its efficiency is low. It is said that after this method is improved, even manual workers can make it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army on Samarinda Highway Strives to Prevent Enemy Advance; Five Assault Teams Launch Attack Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Enemy forces in the Balikpapan area began an offensive on the 20th, causing fierce battles to resume. The Japanese garrison is striving to prevent the enemy from advancing on the Samarinda highway and is implementing its successful assault tactics, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties. They are also coordinating with attacks by the Japanese Air Force, causing extreme chaos in the enemy's positions. In particular, on the 24th, five assault teams led by Sergeant Major Ooi launched an attack simultaneously. That night, they made contact with enemy outposts near the Nani Garu airfield, annihilating six of them. They also charged into enemy forces constructing positions in the mountains behind the airfield, killing or wounding approximately 50 enemy soldiers. Subsequently, on the evening of the 25th, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy's Chen 20 kilometers north of the Nani Garu airfield, killing or wounding approximately 20 enemy soldiers and occupying the position. That night, they cut the enemy's power lines in the vicinity, and the entire team returned to defense on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Night Attack in New Guinea</h3>
<p>Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – After sweeping up enemy troops in the Mar area on April 28, the Japanese New Guinea northern coast combat unit retook its airfield and positions. From early to mid-May, it has repeatedly raided the airfield, thoroughly striking the enemy forces around it. On the night of the 23rd, it launched a fierce night attack on the remaining enemy troops that continued to act up, inflicting considerable damage on enemy personnel and seizing a considerable amount of provisions.</p>
<h3>Large Explosion Occurs in Ulithi Harbor</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From dawn on the 27th for eleven hours, Japanese warships heard continuous large explosions intermittently from the direction of Ulithi Harbor, an enemy base east of Yap Island. It is unknown whether it was caused by an attack by a Japanese submarine or an enemy accident. Judging from the sound of the explosions, Ulithi appears to have suffered considerable damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Counterattacks on Vietnamese Northern Border</h3>
<p>Vietnam Front Line Base, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese troops in various areas have launched counterattacks against the Yu army near the northern border of Vietnam, achieving considerable results. Furthermore, elite Japanese troops near the border in the Ba Yang area also launched a daring melee assault on the enemy in that area on the night of the 26th, defeating them.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Holds Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang held the 260th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 30th. Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members and colleagues from various departments and committees, as well as hundreds of Kuomintang members from government agencies, attended. The event was chaired by Wu Lanxi, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department. After the ceremony, Committee Member Guo Xiufeng reported on "The International Situation," explaining the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as well as the recent situation in the East Asian war. Finally, he elaborated on the issue of achieving unification through anti-communism. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department Broadcasts a Speech on the Reflections of Commemorating the Reception of the Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The 30th marks the second anniversary of China's recovery of the French Concession in Shanghai. Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department broadcasted a speech entitled "Reflections on Commemorating the Reception of the Shanghai Concessions" on the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:20 PM this afternoon, addressing the nation. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, our country received the French Concession in Shanghai, and then on August 1 of the same year, we received the Shanghai International Settlement. At that time, I was the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and I felt deeply honored to participate in the negotiations. Today is the second anniversary of our country's reception of the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai. I would like to take this opportunity to share some thoughts with my compatriots across the country. Recalling June 30, 1943, when our ally Japan and our country agreed to implement the return of the Shanghai International Settlement on August 1, the late Chairman Wang once said in a speech: 'We will make our best efforts to negotiate with France to ensure that the return of the French Concession in Shanghai can be realized no later than August 1 of this year.' Subsequently, the Chinese and French authorities signed the official agreement to return the French Concession in Shanghai in the capital on July 22 of the same year, setting the date of return for July 30 of the same year. Thus, in the enthusiastic anticipation of the people of the whole country, this memorable and celebratory day finally arrived. Today, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the French authorities officially returned the French Concession in Shanghai to our country, and the three words 'French Concession' have forever become a historical term in our country's diplomacy from that day on.</p>
<h3>A Glorious Page in the Last Hundred Years</h3>
<p>When our country had just received the French Concession in Shanghai, and then received the International Settlement in Shanghai on August 1 of that year, it can be said that these were the two most glorious events in our country in the last hundred years. Since Shanghai had concessions, our country has suffered from territorial division and incomplete sovereignty, because the meaning of concessions in international law is called "a state within a state," and the meaning of extraterritoriality in international law is called "an extension of territory." Therefore, as long as concessions and extraterritoriality existed in our country for one day, our country's territorial sovereignty could not be complete for one day. All political and economic matters were affected by the influence of "a state within a state" and by the constraints of "an extension of territory." However, since July 30, 1943, concessions and extraterritoriality have disappeared in our country at the same time, and our country's territory and sovereignty have also become complete at the same time. Now that I think about it, aren't our country's reception of the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai the two most glorious events in our country in the last hundred years?</p>
<p>If it were not for the righteous and devoted assistance of our ally Japan, these two glorious events would certainly not have been realized so easily. Therefore, we are not only grateful to Japan, but also deeply aware of Japan's good intentions to assist our country in achieving freedom and independence. In order to awaken the further understanding of compatriots across the country, I would like to briefly discuss the historical facts.</p>
<h3>Review the Past and Encourage the Future</h3>
<p>Recalling a hundred years ago, our country went to war with Britain due to the prohibition of opium imports. As a result, we were defeated in the war and forced to sign a treaty of surrender, which sowed the seeds of the opening of concessions in Shanghai. For the past hundred years, our country has suffered from the poison of concessions. The whole country unanimously and urgently demanded its recovery, and the national revolution of the past few decades also took the recovery of concessions as one of its main goals. However, the national revolution ultimately failed to thoroughly follow the teachings of Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, so it was not only isolated and helpless, but also caused a wall of conflict among the East Asian nations, and a large part of the national strength was consumed in unnecessary conflicts. Thus, the forces of Britain and the United States were able to continue to occupy our country, and the concessions in Shanghai were also under the control of Britain and the United States, making it impossible to recover them. After the incident, the late Chairman Wang led the peace movement, restoring the original appearance of Sino-Japanese relations. Our country is willing to cooperate with Japan to build East Asia, and Japan is more willing to support our country's freedom and liberation. We should have a deep understanding of Japan's great moral spirit and the facts of need, assisting our country in recovering the concessions.</p>
<h3>Conscientiously Follow Sun Yat-sen's Teachings</h3>
<p>It has been two years since the reception of the Shanghai concessions, but the question I feel is how to build and revitalize the country. Therefore, we should first review the past. The reason why our country's revitalization and construction work has been slow to succeed in the past is, of course, because it was affected by "a state within a state," but the disunity within our country in the past, which led to the rampant warlords and the communist rebellion, was also the main reason why our country's revitalization and construction cause was difficult to complete. Therefore, today, while we are celebrating this glorious day, we must also eradicate the roots of past disasters and open up a great road to national construction for the future. To achieve this goal, compatriots across the country have no other way to follow except to thoroughly believe in the Three Principles of the People. Moreover, compatriots across the country should also know that the Three Principles of the People, hand-drafted by Sun Yat-sen, are different from any other doctrine. The Three Principles of the People are purely based on our country's history and geographical environment, and were carefully studied and formed. Any other doctrine may be suitable in other countries, but when applied to China, there are many incompatible places, and therefore it is definitely not enough to solve China's problems. The Three Principles of the People is a doctrine of national salvation. That sentence may sound empty to a few people who lack self-confidence, but the facts can prove that today, the only thing that can truly save China from danger and destruction is the Three Principles of the People. Without the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of our national revolution, the national revolution is blind. Without the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle of national construction, national construction is also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Although our country has embarked on the path of independence and autonomy with the assistance of our ally Japan, how can we ensure independence and autonomy in the future, and how can we establish a strong country, and unite with the nations of the world on an equal footing to maintain world peace? It goes without saying that we must thoroughly believe in the Three Principles of the People and ensure the Three Principles of the People. When the Three Principles of the People are fully realized, it will be the time when China is truly saved and as solid as a rock.</p>
<h3>The Whole Country Rises Up to Meet the Crisis</h3>
<p>However, in today's severe situation, it is really a critical moment for our country to strive for revitalization. Compatriots across the country must always keep in mind the words that Chairman Chen has shown us: No matter what country wants to survive or wants to revitalize, the most reliable way is to rely on itself. It also says that in order to seek liberation and to seek the true independence and freedom of the country, we need not only patience, but also unity; not only perseverance, but also advancement. China is now in a crisis on all sides. If we do not work hard, we will either be completely communized, or we will be reduced to a British or American colony again. If this is the case, then the National Government's efforts over the years to abolish unequal treaties, recover concessions, and abolish extraterritoriality will all be defeated. Therefore, the people of the whole country should immediately rise up, demand full peace, use the total strength of the whole country to eradicate the red disaster, and eliminate the British and American forces in China. I hope that compatriots across the country will abide by and implement them in order to pass through the difficulties and embark on revitalization.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, as we commemorate the reception of the Shanghai concessions, we should not only feel grateful for the glory of the last hundred years, but also review ourselves, spur ourselves on, follow national policies, correct our thinking, ensure security, increase production, and continue to work hard in accordance with the points that Chairman Chen has instructed us, so as to carry forward this glory of the last hundred years, strive for more glorious results for the country, and make greater contributions.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Practicing Benevolence as the Wealthy</h3>
<p>In May of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association, to assist the authorities in improving police treatment, established a police consumer cooperative, raising 10,000,000 yuan in funds. The association solicited loans from various trade associations and enthusiastic individuals, marking the beginning of collaboration between officials and the public. At that time, this newspaper's editorials repeatedly elaborated on its significance and appealed to all sectors to provide loans. Subsequently, many trade associations and individuals were genuinely helpful, but there were also many who remained hesitant and perfunctory, so that it took months to reach the full amount, only reaching about 40%. This shows that most wealthy citizens have a weak sense of public welfare. Conversely, those with a weak sense of public welfare inevitably value private interests, competing and pursuing nothing but personal profit, so that society is full of speculation, hoarding, and opportunistic practices. In recent years, only Shanghai society has been the most chaotic, which is by no means accidental. At the time, people thought that providing loans was equivalent to making donations. Now, the authorities have agreed to repay the principal and interest in full, and payments will begin today. The authorities' adherence to their word is admirable, especially given the old habits of officialdom, where successors often disavow the accounts of their predecessors. At the same time, it can provide a clear message to those who were stingy in the past, thinking that loans were donations.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the municipal government issued temporary relief bonds, a third of which was also allocated to various trade associations and enthusiastic individuals for subscription. The purpose of these bonds, everyone understood, was undoubtedly for public welfare. However, some trade associations still only partially subscribed or did not meet the full amount. Despite repeated extensions, they still delayed payment, which is regrettable. Of the relief bonds, 200,000,000 yuan were originally designated for air raid relief funds. However, with the current urgent need for disaster relief and funds, the president of the Citizens' Welfare Association, Wen Guanting, and the vice president, Li Sihao, have taken the lead in finding ways to advance the 130,000,000 yuan of unsubscribed relief bonds. It is hoped that trade associations that have not yet paid in full will no longer delay and will promptly pay up within the deadline. Moreover, subscribing to relief bonds will allow for the return of both principal and interest in the future (the first period has already been announced for interest payment), which is different in nature from making donations. Currently, donations for disaster relief are very enthusiastic, so subscribing to relief bonds can both provide relief to disaster victims and recover the principal and interest. We believe that trade associations that have not yet paid in full will be able to make every effort to jointly contribute to this good cause.</p>
<p>Recently, everyone has sympathized with the displaced and suffering air raid victims. The public is assisting the authorities in carrying out relief and rescue work. Both relief and rescue require a large amount of funding. In addition to government allocations, it is especially hoped that individuals will voluntarily donate. The amount of donations received by this newspaper on behalf of donors in recent days is not large, but the number of donating units is very high, which is quite encouraging. However, although donations are very enthusiastic, why is the total amount of donations not very large? Because the donors tend to be those with lower financial capacity, so the amount is small. However, we do not believe that those with higher financial capacity are less enthusiastic about public welfare than others. Therefore, we sincerely hope that merchants and magnates will show compassion and also enthusiastically donate. Then, the total amount of donations can quickly rise. According to the Air Raid Relief Committee's estimate, the first phase of disaster relief funding requires 200,000,000 yuan. After deducting government allocations and donations already received, there is still more than half missing. Assuming it is 100,000,000 yuan, divided into 100 units, each unit is 1,000,000 yuan. If each wealthy merchant donates one unit, then 100 wealthy merchants can solve the problem. According to our estimates, in vast Shanghai, there are more than a thousand people who can donate one unit with one ten-thousandth or one thousandth of their wealth. Then, as long as the wealthy are merciful, the disaster victims can be saved. The wealthy should practice benevolence, and everyone should strive for it.</p>
<p>What we have said above is nothing more than hoping that someone among the citizens will be enthusiastic about social welfare. Finally, we believe that in addition to the government providing compensation to the firefighters, air defense personnel, police, and Baojia personnel who sacrificed or were disabled due to rescue work during air raids, the public should also provide special compensation. The Citizens' Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Committee advocates using the second phase of donations to replenish fire and air defense funds. We believe that a portion should be allocated as compensation for those injured or killed in the line of duty, as a fair representation of the people.</p>
<h3>Indian Ocean Warplanes Gradually Become Familiar with Japanese Elite, Severely Monitoring Enemy Supply Routes South of Donggua</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Indian Ocean Base, 30th – The enemy mobile unit that appeared in the waters around Phuket Island, southern Thailand, on the 25th of this month continues to stir, but it has been fiercely countered by Japanese forces stationed there, preventing the enemy from landing. On the night of the 26th, it was fiercely attacked by Japanese special attack planes, and a cruiser and a large ship were sunk, eventually moving out of the Japanese attack range. Recently, the enemy announced that the British Eastern Indian Fleet is based on the battleships Queen Elizabeth, Renown, and the French battleship Richelieu, plus seven cruisers and fourteen destroyers. In addition, according to various intelligence reports, there are currently seven or eight fast aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean, and the enemy fleet that stirred this time is probably a part of it. The enemy's attempt to attack this time is twofold: first, to reconnoiter the strength of the south coast, and second, to alleviate the difficulties of the counterattack in Burma and implement a distraction operation. The enemy is anxious to counterattack Malaya, so it is reconnoitering the Japanese defense positions on the south coast, and trying to alleviate the bitter battles in the Donggua and Bago areas of Burma, and the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army centered on the Xidan River. The elite Japanese land, sea, and air forces are severely monitoring the enemy's movements and are fully confident of destroying the enemy's attack.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Burmese Front Base, 30th – The elite Japanese troops defending the Begu Yuma Mountains have always held their positions, blocking the enemy's main force, and at the same time attacking the vital supply arteries of the Rangoon and Prome highways, hindering the transport of enemy supplies. This time, they crossed the Sandan River, launched a clever infiltration operation, secured the two fortresses of Nika and Myokyo, and coordinated with the westward-advancing troops to organize a pincer attack system. To severely damage the enemy in the Xidan River basin, they began to advance eastward. On the Burmese highway south of Donggua, they cut off the enemy's supply routes everywhere, causing the enemy to suffer increased losses. The enemy blew up the bridge necessary for transportation at a location fifteen kilometers north of Donggua, and is in extreme chaos. The enemy has made great sacrifices to consolidate the battle situation, avoid the retreat of the 15th Division, newly deploy the 7th Division, and devote its air force strength to assist in the operation. In addition, the Japanese troops fighting against the enemy armored division in the area west of Mokji have switched to the offensive since the 16th of this month, forcibly crossed the Takuet River successfully, and are currently attacking the enemy's important strongholds.</p>
<h3>National Government to Hold Commemorative Ceremony for Restoration Day Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th – August 1st is the second Restoration Day of our country. Recalling that after the National Government moved its capital, thanks to the continuous efforts of the highest authorities and the sincere cooperation of the allied nation Japan, on July 30th and August 1st of the 32nd year, the concessions in Shanghai and other places, which had been used by the powers as bases to exploit East Asia for a hundred years, were all recovered, making our national sovereignty complete again. This is truly a great event in the epoch-making national revolution. The government authorities specifically designated August 1st as Restoration Day. Now that the second session has arrived, the National Government authorities, in order to commemorate this day of great significance in the history of our country's restoration, specifically decided to hold a grand commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the National Government at 9:00 a.m. on that day. At the same time, all provinces and cities across the country will also launch commemorative events separately.</p>
<h3>Provincial Governor Allocates Funds to Relieve Shanghai Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 30th – The U.S. aircraft recently carried out continuous indiscriminate bombings of Shanghai, and disaster victims urgently need relief. Enthusiastic people in Suzhou society have already donated 50,000,000 yuan for relief. Now, Governor Ren, in view of the large number of disaster victims in Shanghai, has ordered the finance department to allocate 10,000,000 yuan to be remitted to Shanghai for relief purposes.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Plans to Rush Repairs to the Canal Embankment</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Yangzhou, 30th – Since the incident, the canal embankment in northern Jiangsu has been damaged due to military influences. Although the water conservancy authorities have paid attention to repairs at any time, its terrain is special, and the New Fourth Army appears and disappears in the area, and often destroys it, making it difficult to repair immediately. Recently, the floodwaters have surged, washing away the built dams, causing the water to be stored to flow down with the floodwaters, and the downstream of the canal embankment will suffer major damage. The Northern Jiangsu Canal Engineering Office has recently drafted a flood control plan for the 34th year, which has been reported to the Northern Jiangsu Appeasement Office for review and handling, in order to carry out timely prevention and repair and avoid flooding.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Rectifies Water Transportation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – Zhejiang Province's water transportation has been hampered by frequent wars, which has had a profound impact on transportation, logistics, and local prosperity. Governor Liao, in view of this, based on the recommendations of the Provincial Advisory Committee, ordered the relevant agencies to focus on reorganizing the five shipping routes of Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, Shaoxing-Xiaoshan, Hangzhou-Yuqian, and Hangzhou-Fuyang, and ordered the Liji Company to be responsible for handling shipping matters on each route. Zhejiang Province's transportation will become smoother.</p>
<h3>County Police Implement School Training</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – In order to strengthen the police teams of various counties and unify the organization, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has formulated police training rules for each county, ordering the counties to train the police in various technical subjects in order to improve their overall quality and cultivate them into a strong force to defend the local area.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Prepares to Purchase Food</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – In order to prevent the rise in rice prices during the lean season, the Provincial Advisory Committee has formulated a plan to mobilize merchants and people to purchase flour to meet urgent needs, and to raise huge sums of money to order the municipal government to organize a procurement agency with the municipal chamber of commerce to carry out procurement work. After being submitted to the provincial government for approval, various tasks will begin.</p>
<h3>Potsdam Conference to Conclude Soon, Details of Discussions Cannot Be Ascertained</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th – According to a report from the British correspondent in Berlin: The end of the Potsdam Conference is imminent. Although there is no official confirmation, informed circles in Berlin firmly believe that everything discussed at the conference will be completed by Tuesday or Wednesday. At the same time, it is possible that the speeches to be delivered at the final meeting have already been drafted. The conference was in progress yesterday and achieved satisfactory results, but the detailed contents of the discussions among the three heads of state cannot be ascertained. The three leaders have held twelve meetings, but at each meeting, no true content of the meeting was revealed. The joint declaration on Japan by the United States, Britain, and Chongqing has nothing to do with the three-power conference, because the Soviet Union does not want to declare war on Japan. If it is intended to be published before the end of the conference, there is no strong basis for a communique on the Asian war. The topics of the conference do not involve military matters. According to a Soviet Communist Party newspaper, "The future of Germany is the main topic of the Potsdam Conference." According to the diplomatic correspondent of the London Sunday Newspaper, the new British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin, both believe that the Labour Party government has just been established, and it is inconvenient to participate in the decision of various major issues in the meeting. Therefore, they may ask Truman and Stalin to allow other major issues to be postponed until the second half of the year for further discussion.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Welfare Records National Exercise Method</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th – In the past, in order to make it easier for the general public to exercise, the Ministry of Social Welfare created a National Leisure Exercise Method. Now, in order to enable all localities to practice from time to time, experts have been hired to record a large number of exercise records, which will be distributed to radio stations in various places for broadcasting in the shortest possible time, so that the public can exercise according to law and enhance their physique.</p>
<h3>War-Weariness in Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – After the news of the Labour Party's victory in Britain came out, all parties felt surprised. However, in view of the current situation at the end of the European war and the imminent end of the world war, this phenomenon is not surprising. This is because the British people have suffered from six years of war and are extremely tired. During the war, the British people could only expect and look forward to how to rebuild their personal safe lives. Therefore, Churchill, the Conservative Party who adhered to British imperialism, was far less attractive than the Labour Party, who advocated stable people's livelihood, solving housing problems, and guaranteeing employment. In short, the British people's vote this time was not for Churchill, nor for Attlee, but for the Labour Party's program of stable life. From this, it can be seen that the British people are concerned and worried that the war will be prolonged, and it is also a fact that the British army does not want to go to war in East Asia. In this general election, about 70% of the soldiers on the front lines voted for the Labour Party, which guaranteed post-war employment, which is also a very noteworthy phenomenon. As for the United States, its desire to achieve peace is no less than that of Britain, and the momentum to transform military demand into civilian demand is particularly significant. The recent food famine in the United States has especially made the general public dissatisfied. When American people received the news that the U.S. military in Okinawa suffered heavy casualties, they sighed that it was not worth the loss to mobilize the main force of the Pacific Fleet and dispatch a large number of army troops to capture a small isolated island, and it took three months, which led to the responsibility issue of Nimitz. Recently, the United States has also revealed the argument of peace conditions with Japan, and the reason is only to end the East Asian war as soon as possible. Therefore, the governments of Britain and the United States, in view of the unanimous surging of the domestic peace trend, had to seek countermeasures urgently to avoid their bloodshed and sacrifice. The release of the joint declaration on Japan by the three countries on the 28th is also a reflection of domestic demands.</p>
<h3>British New Parliament Adjourned</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th – According to London: The date for the convening of the British new parliament has been decided to be postponed to August 15th. The King will deliver a speech on that day.</p>
<h3>Morrison to Act as British Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – According to TASS, London: Reuters reported that information revealed by the Prime Minister's Office on the evening of July 28 stated that during Prime Minister Attlee's stay in Potsdam for the Three-Headed Conference, government affairs will be handled by the President of the Privy Council, Morrison.</p>
<h3>German Army Lost Over Four Million in Five Years of War</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th – According to a British reporter in Berlin, a very important secret document was found in the official residence of General Rinnack, the general director of the propaganda movement of the German Supreme Command, which detailed the German military losses from September 1, 1939, to November 30, 1944, as follows:</p>
<p>The total number of German military losses was 4,064,438, of which 1,911,300 died, 1,435,853 were missing, and 278,201 were captured. The numbers of the three do not match the total, but the numbers of the three do not include the German military losses from November of last year to May of this year. At the same time, the secret document also stated that in November of last year, 774,148 injured German soldiers were still recuperating in hospitals. Also, when fighting on the German border front line, 64,000 German soldiers were killed by Allied aircraft, 1,000 were missing, and about 9,000 were executed for violating military law.</p>
<h3>British Eighth Army Ordered to Dissolve</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berne, 30th – According to information obtained here: Official news from Rome stated that the British Eighth Army was officially ordered to dissolve at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The army had fought in North Africa, Sicily, and the Italian mainland.</p>
<h3>Pétain Continues to be Tried, Implicating Laval, Witnesses Give Testimony</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berne, 30th – According to Paris: The trial of Marshal Pétain began today. Many of the witnesses' testimonies involved former Vichy leader Laval, who is currently in Spain and cannot immediately appear in court. According to Duen, former chairman of the German armistice agreement committee in Wiesbaden, France, "Laval is truly a lowly degenerate." According to Blum, "Laval is the one who played the trick of the Vichy regime." According to Rocks, "Laval did his best to promote discord between Britain and France." According to a female witness (35 years old, named Denise Bettite, secretary to an instructor in an Italian newspaper in Paris until 1941): "Laval's intention was to form an alliance of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain to replace the current United Nations." Laval is currently detained in the Mentqueuy forest in Barcelona. Laval resided there when Germany collapsed. It is claimed that Laval went to Spain and asked the Spanish authorities for protection after the French authorities refused to protect his safety, so that he would not be tried in Paris at the same time as Pétain.</p>

<p>Authorities Deeply Hope Citizens will Assist in Reorganizing Traffic, Designating Every Wednesday as Traffic Safety Day</p>
<p>In order to reorganize traffic order in all districts of the city, improve citizens' traffic ethics, thoroughly abide by the rules, and reduce traffic accidents, the Municipal Police Department, in conjunction with the Allied military authorities and Baojia personnel, implemented a Traffic Reorganization Strengthening Week from the 25th to the 31st. Thanks to the cooperation of the military police and citizens, the results were satisfactory. The Second Division of the Municipal Police Department, in view of the fact that today is the last day of Traffic Reorganization Week, held a symposium for the city's news media at the club on the seventh floor of the bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Chief Hiraoka of the Second Division was unable to attend due to official duties, and Police Chief Kobayashi attended on behalf of him, along with Traffic Section Chief Chen Shutong, Deputy Section Chief Yoshino Sakae, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<h3>Chief Kobayashi's Speech</h3>
<p>During the meeting, Chief Kobayashi delivered a speech on behalf of Chief Hiraoka, stating that the city's traffic situation is chaotic and disorderly due to the increase in vehicles and the fact that drivers, coachmen, and the general public treat the current traffic management regulations as mere formalities, competing to be first. Once an emergency occurs, traffic accidents and citizen injuries are inevitable. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity to announce the Land Traffic Management Regulations, a Reorganization Strengthening Week was implemented to increase people's awareness of traffic control. Looking back on the week, with the active cooperation of the Allied Army and Navy authorities, the Police Department authorities, and Baojia personnel, the results were satisfactory, but still did not meet our ideal goals. The focus of this week's implementation is to strictly observe left-hand traffic and absolutely obey traffic command signals. For a week, military police personnel have been serving enthusiastically, organizing traffic on various roads, but the general public still does not pay attention to traffic light signals, drivers stop beyond the stop line, and pedestrians arbitrarily cross the road. These situations easily cause accidents and lead to chaos. It is hoped that citizens will actively assist in reorganizing traffic for the sake of their own safety and the safety of others, to achieve the goal of safe traffic. At the same time, it is stipulated that every Wednesday is Traffic Safety Day, and vehicles and pedestrians who do not obey the rules will be strictly punished. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention and cooperate.</p>
<h3>Traffic Section Chief's Report</h3>
<p>Traffic Section Chief then reported on the city's vehicle situation, stating that the number of motor vehicles in the city is currently more than 5,000 less than five years ago, and the number of trucks is 1,600 less, but the number of manual rickshaws, tricycles, and bicycles has greatly increased, reaching more than 9,000. Because the areas have been merged, the driving area is concentrated, so in addition to implementing training for traffic police, their level and equipment have also been improved.</p>
<p>Deputy Section Chief Yoshino reported that the number of traffic police has decreased compared to the past, and efforts are being made to improve their quality and restore the use of whistles. At the same time, the Traffic Section is in contact with the Construction Bureau to draw very clear traffic standard signs on various roads to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>Finally, reporters from various newspapers raised issues such as restoring one-way traffic on narrow roads, strictly prohibiting two people from riding bicycles, and vendors on sidewalks for discussion. The Traffic Section will investigate in detail and then make improvements. The discussion ended at around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Five Groups Scheduled to Bid Farewell to Director Matsudaira and Welcome New Director Katsuno</h3>
<p>Director Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy has been ordered to transfer to the Embassy in Peiping. Reporters from newspapers in the city jointly held a farewell banquet for him a few days ago. At 12:00 noon yesterday (30th), Director Matsudaira hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at the Shuyu Sichuan Restaurant, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious. It is also known that the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, the China Broadcasting Association, the China Film Company, the Shanghai Magazine Federation, and the Shanghai Small Newspaper Federation will jointly hold a tea party on August 2nd to bid farewell to Director Matsudaira and welcome the new Director Katsuno.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow the City Celebrates the Second Restoration Day</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (the 1st) is the second Restoration Day of the Republic of China, and the second anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concessions. The Municipal Publicity Office will launch various publicity activities to celebrate.

<h3>Responding to Wartime Material Conservation The *Guomin Xinwen* Newspaper to Cease Publication Automatically</h3>
<p>The *Guomin Xinwen* newspaper, in order to adapt to the needs of the times, expanded from a small newspaper to a large daily newspaper on February 28, 1941. It has been four years and five months since then. In these short years, it has conveyed faint calls for the belief of "nation-building." Although it has gone through many hardships, thanks to the guidance and encouragement of Chairman Zhou and the love of readers, it has been able to overcome difficulties and complete a part of the arduous task of publicizing national policies and inspiring morale. However, recently, due to the lack of both financial and material resources, in order to respond to the wartime policy of conserving materials, it has decided to cease publication from August 1st, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Zhou, and to reserve the saved financial, material, and human resources for future use. Once resources are abundant and there is a need from all parties, it will resume publication at any time to serve the country and society again.</p>
<h3>A Wealthy Man's Act of Kindness: A Struggling Student Smiles Through Tears Awaits Support for Difference in Scholarship</h3>
<p>For nearly a month, our colleagues have been handling all the procedures for scholarship assistance, and they are generally in order. More than 3,600 returning students, plus more than 3,000 new students, have reviewed the registration lists of students at all levels in each school. The lists are indeed a grand sight. Many of these promising young people will surely be talented individuals in the future and pillars of the new China. Unfortunately, they are all impoverished children who have suffered through eight years of war and are oppressed by high prices, making their living conditions impossible to cope with. This is such a pitiful and painful thing!</p>
<h3>The Owner of Jingming Hall Borrows Money to Help Students Creates the Highest Scholarship Record of This Year</h3>
<p>The owner of Jingming Hall, over sixty years old, has lived a frugal life and supported himself through his own efforts without property. Recently, seeing that the scholarship fund for this year's applicants is far from the target, he expressed his infinite sympathy and offered his years of hard-earned private savings, mortgaging 20,000,000 yuan to donate to our newspaper's charity medical team, setting the highest record for this year. His enthusiasm and righteous deeds are truly admirable. It is hoped that wealthy gentlemen in Shanghai will follow the owner's virtues and generously donate so that this year's scholarship fund will reach its target early and not fall short of success.</p>
<p>The scholarship work carried out by this newspaper over the years aims, first and foremost, to rescue this large group of lovely young people from adverse circumstances, to sift gold from the sand, and to present them to the wealthy and compassionate people of Shanghai. It is hoped that everyone will think of the country and the nation, donate a few more coins, contribute a little more effort, and take on the responsibility of cultivation to fulfill the greatest obligation to the next generation of citizens. Now, the registration lists have been prepared, and a strict examination will be held at Datong University on News Road on August 5th to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, selecting 4,000 students to continue their hard studies. However, the scholarship fund of 350,000,000 yuan is still far from the target, even after a month. How will the enthusiastic gentlemen take action to prevent them from worrying like fire? How will they lend a hand to make them smile through their tears? Dear sirs, time is of the essence! Do not wait and see, do not delay, this is what our colleagues earnestly wish for readers.</p>
<p>Please each school quickly submit the application forms - This office checks that each University, college, high school, middle school, and elementary school still has a small number of schools that has not sent the old and new student application to the center, causing an inability to register. The screening and test will be on August 5 at the Xinwen Road Datong University, and the date is close. Each school must submit the forms by 5PM today (31st). Late submissions will not be accommodated.</p>

<h3>Notice on the Re-issuance of Residence Permits for Citizens in Newly Merged Areas</h3>
<p>The six newly merged areas of this city, namely, Penglai, Yimiao, Xieqiao, Xujiahui, Zhabei, and Dongchang (One Five and Two Joint Guarantee), are now nearing completion of the population census. The Baojia Department of the Municipal Police Bureau has specially set August 1 as the date to begin the re-issuance of residence permits for the above six districts. At that time, citizens should comply with the notices from their respective sub-bureaus and joint guarantee offices and go to their respective sub-bureaus to have their fingerprints taken on the specified dates. The following is a detailed notice on the re-issuance of residence permits after revisions:</p>
<p>All citizens between the ages of 12 and 60 must apply for a residence permit in accordance with these regulations. (Citizens who are not within the specified age range may also apply for a residence permit at the same time in accordance with these regulations if they voluntarily wish to obtain one.)</p>
<p>[Residence permit application forms can be purchased by residents from their respective Baojia offices (to recover the cost of printing).]</p>
<p>The fourth section of each sub-bureau must first schedule the dates and times for fingerprinting of each *bao* according to the numerical order of the *baojia*, and when issuing the application forms, notify the *lianbao* chief to bring the notice to each citizen through the *bao* chief, *jia* chief, and head of household, so that they go to the sub-bureau to have their fingerprints taken on schedule.</p>
<p>[After a citizen purchases a residence permit application form, they should use a writing brush and regular script to clearly fill in the number on the old citizen certificate and all the items to be filled in on the application form, affix a seal, and ask the head of household and *jia* chief to affix their seals. Enclose a handling fee of 100 yuan and two bareheaded 2.5-inch photos. (Those who have already obtained a citizen certificate from the sub-bureau are exempt from submitting photos unless their photos are damaged.) The citizen must also, in accordance with the regulations of the sub-bureau, have the *jia* chief accompany them to the fourth section of the sub-bureau to have their fingerprints taken simultaneously on the application form and the blank residence permit, so that the blank residence permit is filled in with the same number as on the application form and the receipt for the handling fee, in order to avoid errors.]</p>
<p>The fourth section of each sub-bureau shall, based on the items on the fingerprint-marked application form, retrieve the old application form, verify that there are no errors, and then fill in the residence permit and process the photo pasting, registration, and hard seal affixing procedures.</p>
<p>After the fourth section of each sub-bureau has completed all the procedures for the residence permit, it shall send them in batches to the respective military police teams for stamping, and at the same time, it shall submit the number of people sent for stamping each time to the Baojia Department for record. During the period when the fourth section of each sub-bureau is processing the issuance of residence permits, in addition to assigning special personnel to the sub-bureaus for supervision and inspection, the fourth section of each sub-bureau must also fill in a "Residence Permit Daily Report" in the prescribed format and submit it to the department for verification.</p>
<p>After the fourth section of each sub-bureau receives the newly issued residence permits, it shall schedule the dates and times, divided by *bao* and *jia*, and notify the *lianbao jia* chiefs to inform each household, and the head of each household shall collect the old citizen certificates of all citizens in their household and go to the fourth section of the sub-bureau on the specified date to exchange for the new residence permits and distribute them to each citizen for use.</p>
<p>Citizens who have newly moved into the area and citizens from other ports who have come to Shanghai must provide a movement certificate, travel permit, good citizen certificate, county citizen certificate, or other documents issued by the authorities at the place of departure. If they do not have the above-mentioned supporting documents, they must find a guarantor from a shop or two people with the qualifications of a head of household to act as guarantors before they can apply. They must also enclose two photos and a handling fee of 100 yuan. The remaining procedures are the same as the general procedures.</p>
<p>If a citizen who has completed the application procedures loses their old citizen certificate before the residence permit is issued, they must immediately report to the fourth section of the sub-bureau and find a guarantor from a shop or two people with the qualifications of a head of household to provide proof, and submit two additional 2.5-inch photos and a handling fee of 500 yuan to apply to the fourth section of the sub-bureau for issuance.</p>
<p>Citizens who are indeed ill, pregnant women who are about to give birth, or who are in the puerperal period must ask the *baojia* chief to provide proof, and the fourth section of the sub-bureau may separately schedule a date to apply for the re-issuance of the residence permit.</p>
<p>Civil servants and people who work outside every day and cannot ask for leave may have the fourth section of the sub-bureau try to use Sundays to make up for fingerprinting.</p>
<p>If a citizen has one of the following disabilities, after the *baojia* chief provides proof, the fingerprinting procedures shall be handled by personnel from the fourth section of the sub-bureau going to the citizen's residence. In addition to collecting the prescribed handling fee of 100 yuan, no other fees shall be collected. A. Blind in both eyes. B. Mute.</p>
<p>Gentry and celebrities who have made every effort in local public welfare undertakings and are recognized by society, and senior officials of the municipal government, may have personnel from the sub-bureau go to their residences to handle fingerprinting after considering their applications.</p>
<p>Anyone who meets one of the following conditions is exempt from fingerprinting for themselves and their immediate family members. (A) Officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment in the current National Government. (B) Members of the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang. All persons who meet the application qualifications in the above items must fill out the residence permit application form in the prescribed format and affix their seals before the specified date, and submit a letter together with supporting documents and two 2.5-inch photos to the Baojia Department for application.</p>
<p>After receiving the above application documents, the Baojia Department shall review them and notify the fourth section of the respective sub-bureaus and the applicants themselves as soon as possible if they pass.</p>
<p>Applicants in the preceding article shall, after receiving the notification from the Baojia Department, take the notification letter with a handling fee of 100 yuan per person, their old citizen certificates, and their personal seals, and send personnel or go directly to the fourth section of the sub-bureau to apply.</p>
<p>The old citizen certificates of children between the ages of seven and twelve who have citizen certificates shall be collected by the respective heads of household and returned to the fourth section of the respective sub-bureaus for cancellation at the same time when exchanging for residence permits.</p>
<p>Note: In order to simplify the procedures for this re-issuance of residence permits, the Bureau has repeatedly studied the exchange method in order to improve it. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate fully and strictly abide by the methods and regulations promulgated by the authorities, so as to avoid trouble for both parties.</p>
<p>The *baojia* chiefs in each district must understand the methods promulgated by the authorities during the period of exchanging residence permits, and contact the fourth section of the sub-bureau at any time, give detailed instructions to the mayor, and not be nitpicking or deliberately make things difficult.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Individuals from All Walks of Life Responding to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's Accounting Department states: "Recently, our city has been frequently subjected to air raids, and the disaster area is extensive. We, the staff, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and feel deeply distressed. Therefore, we are donating 500,000 National Currency units as a token contribution to air raid relief. However, considering the large number of victims and the perceived lack of treatment facilities, we feel that even minor injuries can lead to death due to a lack of timely first aid, which is a great pity. The most urgently needed thing at present is general first aid knowledge. However, there are very few publications of this kind. We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to and promote this issue, or invite experienced doctors to compile a small handbook on 'First Aid Medical Knowledge,' detailing first aid methods, main medications, and their usage, and make them publicly available so that citizens can use them at any time to reduce mortality, which would be of considerable benefit. Therefore, without being ashamed of our ignorance, we contribute our humble opinion, hoping that the authorities will adopt it."</p>
<p>A letter from the staff of the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Telegraph General Bureau states: "Recently, the Shanghai urban area has been repeatedly bombed, resulting in a wide disaster area. The affected compatriots have suffered broken families, death, and displacement, the tragic situation is self-evident. We, the staff, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and cannot bear to stand idly by. Furthermore, we believe that providing relief to the disaster victims is a matter of utmost urgency. Therefore, all staff members have contributed to the best of their abilities, collectively raising 350,000 National Currency units, which are respectfully offered as a donation for disaster relief. We hope that all institutions, companies, and commercial firms will respond enthusiastically, contributing whatever effort and money they can, so that small contributions can accumulate into great achievements, and small amounts of sand can build up into a tower. This would truly be a blessing for the bombed compatriots."</p>
<p>A letter from the staff of Lao Jie Fu Silk and Satin Store states: "Our city has been bombed for several consecutive days, and the disaster situation is severe. We, the staff, are heartbroken by what we have witnessed and cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, we have raised 622,000 National Currency units. Please accept them and promptly forward them to the relief agencies, we hope." Also, Mr. Gao Guosong, a barber at Lao Jie Fu Barber Shop, wrote that he saw the city suffered continuous air raids, which caused severe disasters, and he couldn't bear to see such a tragic scene. He specifically donated 30,000 National Currency units earned from barbering during the week from July 23rd to July 29th to the affected compatriots, expressing his sympathy.</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Fu Tiren states: "Yesterday was my twelfth birthday, and my father rewarded me with 100,000 yuan. I didn't dare to waste it and wanted to do something valuable to commemorate the occasion. Recently, our city has been continuously subjected to air raids, and the casualties are so tragic that I cannot bear to witness or hear about them. Therefore, I am sending this 100,000 yuan to your institution as air raid relief money. The small amount is just a token of my heartfelt feelings. Please accept it."</p>
