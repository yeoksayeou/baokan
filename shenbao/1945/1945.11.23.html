<p>〔本報重慶二十二日專電〕此問盛傳蘇聯對中央政府之答覆，業已送達，謂內容保證不干涉中央軍開入東九省，並信守中蘇條約。惟長春附近之機塲，應用困難，故空運尙無法求其實現，共軍刻在瀋陽一帶趕築防禦工事。杜聿明部已推進至連山，續向葫蘆島前進。錦州及南口一帶共軍調動頻繁，風雲至緊。山東半島北岸共軍催拉所有船隻，來往遼東半島間，山東北部各地均有接觸。中央軍已進駐與城，華北交通綫，隨處遭遇襲擊。天津秦皇烏問除空運外，北寗路綫已不通近週，路軌時被破壞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十二日電〕軍息：國軍開入東北後，已佔據長城外一百八十里之興城，正向四十五里外之連山推進中。興城為北寗路要鎭，連山距軍所據葫蘆島僅二十四里。國軍克復葫蘆島後，即可獲得登陸據點。同時另有國軍向南口集中，以便進取共軍所據張家口。聞中國方面要求蘇聯准許國軍四萬五千人空運審陽。此外，包頭及歸綏守軍，數度擊退共軍新將攻勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津二十二日電〕國軍進入東九省，今日向北寗路要害錦州推進，預料共軍將在該處堅强抵抗。另一路國軍包抄鐵路，已到山海關北一百三十五里之綏中，迄今雙方尙無劇戰。據東北方面來津之某外人稱：八路軍在東九省自蘇軍士兵個人，獲得直接間接之接濟，該外人係因被遣回國來津者。共軍於數星期來退出華中，似將不惜代價，以保東北，其勁旅現集中於潘陽哈爾濱。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二十二日電〕消息靈通方面宣稱，東北保安司令杜聿明，現在綏中親自指揮作戰，預料即可佔領葫蘆島，並於四五日內進攻錦州。同時又傳，共軍總司令朱德業已到達瀋陽，將親自指揮東北戰事。國軍前鋒離錦州僅一百另五里，大戰預測或將在該處展開。消息靈通方面稱，東北武裝共軍僅有五十萬人，實力並不雄厚，且此五十萬人中，一部份係以前偽「滿洲國」日軍及各工廠工人人，彼等對共軍是否效忠，頗成疑問。</p>
<h3 id="c2">中蘇談判無進步 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社重慶二十二日電〕外交部次長劉鍇昨日宣稱：關於國軍接收東北蘇聯佔領區問題，軍慶與莫斯科現仍在繼續談判。關於越南問題，劉氏申稱：政府仍在與法當局會商，討論國軍自越南撤退，及其他有關越南華僑事宜。劉氏又稱：中國派遣外交使節至暹羅一事，尙未作最後決定。外蒙獨立，中國亦尙未正式予以承認。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十二日電〕據時事新報載稱，中蘇兩國，日來正就東九省問題，在重慶。莫斯科及華盛頓三地，進行談判。此問外交部情形緊張，燈火徹夜不熄。據外交部發言人昨日宣稱：關於國軍開入東九省一事，談判仍無進步。某記者問，按照中蘇條約，蘇聯聲明尊重中國在東九省全部主權，並承認其領土及行政完整，則中蘇舉行談判，是否必要？該發言人拒絕作答。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶二十二日電〕據某報載稱：東北問題現正在重慶。莫斯科及華盛頓三處，分別進行談判。朮慶方面外交部長王世杰代表蔣委員長，幾每日與條聯駐華大使彼得洛夫會晤；華盛頓方面，中國駐美大使魏道明，與美國務卿貝爾納斯亦正舉行會談，至在莫斯科負責談判者，則爲中國駐蘇大使傳秉常及條聯外長莫洛托夫。</p>

<p>〔合衆社重慶廿二日電〕頃據海南島遊擊司令部王司令向報界宣布，該島日軍業已被完全解除武裝。據稱二該處共軍對於當局業已完成接收工作之海港。機塲。鐵路及工廠，不惜鼓動罷工風潮，企圖予接收者以阻撓。王司令又謂：渠不久將赴渝述戰，並擬向蔣委員長呈請參照台灣成例，將海南到設省。渠稱，截止日軍投降日止，日人在海南六年建設計劃方面，已完成三分之一。</p>

<p>〔本報二十二日重慶電〕政治協商會議，因共黨代表周恩。來要求回延安請示出席人員名單等事，現有延期至下月一日舉行之議。</p>
<p>〔中央社二十二日重慶電〕國民參政會經濟策進會　黔區主任褚輔成，廿一日由昆飛抵渝，據談，本人亟願於政治協商會議召開時，能以一非代表之身份在會外提供若干意見。蓋中國於抗戰勝利後，實不容再有戰爭，以阻礙建國工作之進行。世界人類亦應盡最大努力，進免第三次世界之浩刦，一切問題，應以政治商談，求得解決，斷不能訴諸戰爭。</p>

<p>〔中央社漯河二十二日電〕（一）棗陽東北湖陽鎮，黑龍廟一帶，中共軍李先念主力結集，達十餘團，　日不斷進犯，戰事甚烈。共軍皮定軍部一團，由泌陽西南平氏，竄棗陽，策應李部作戰。（二）共軍四千餘，附輕重機槍四十餘挺，迫擊砲十餘門，三日攻佔鄂東禮山，及三里城，禮山現集有共軍四團。（三）豫南羅山城南水碧冲潘新店，近被共軍包團，經扶縣亦在被國中。（四）信陽五里店南黃文山共軍二百餘，到處竄擾</p>
<p>〔又電〕（一）共軍進犯太康，國軍曾據獲其重要文件，內有軍共冀魯豫行署豫東辦事處訓令一件，竟將豫東各縣縣名史改。杞縣改芝圃，陳留改克威，通許改達生，扶溝改太西，淮陽改淮太，太康改慶羊，故意混亂名稱，目的在破壞我行政系統。（二）遂平西查牙山，上月起，共軍强迫征糧，不計田畝，每村派繳數萬斤。並另派棉衣款，鞋褀費甚重。（三）遂平屬沙河店，上月底，被共軍攻入，刦出商民貨物甚多，公敎人員眷屬多名被殺。（四）確山屬留莊，共軍强迫人民完糧，海畝交法幣一百六十元。</p>

<p>— 房滄浪</p>
<p>一　弔無名英雄</p>
<p>去冬伊犁之變，參加攻城之匪徒，除一部哈匪以外，傳尙有慣匪馬仲英部，及若干蒙匪。守城部陰，為國軍預備第七師，該師被圍月餘，糧絕而後，猶死守不退。本年一月八日，城破，該師副師長杜德孚，參謀長曹日曛，已突圍而出，行二十里後，不忍城中民衆，橫被殺戳，再反身拚死衝入城內，將萬餘老弱婦孺救出重圍，此時匪已迫近，天際及四山彈如雨下，杜副師長令民衆速逃，木人則率兵殿後，奮勇與匪衆肉搏，後來匪衆大至，全師傷亡過半，並因天氣嚴寒，雪深沒頸。古人描寫塞外風光，如墮指裂膚，堅冰在鬚之慘象，一一呈現。據該師逃出僅餘之士兵談，當時作戰地帶之四週山地，皚皚白雪中，瀑布血花，一片朱殷，已莫辨是雪是血。戰至深夜，力盡援絕，該師自連排長以上之軍官佐，及杜副師長德孚，曹參謀長日矄，遂全體自殺，以報黨國。同時民衆被殺者，亦有四五千之多，餘皆被匪衆擄去。自抗戰以來，我軍民殉國，死事之慘，無出其右。　杜副師長是湖南人，軍校三期高材生，曹參謀長出身軍校六期一大陸十四期，將軍死在塞上。謹以此篇，弔該師死難之數千無名英雄。</p>
<p>二　甘肅的災情</p>
<p>伊犁事變以後，新疆人士，由河西跑到蘭州去的，為數甚多。伊犁九城，是新疆的糧倉，伊犁不守，迪化糧價暨一般物價，乃跳躍飛漲，無法遏制，今夏生活，竟高出重慶五倍以上。在這一時期，外省人在新疆工作的，大多將家眷送到蘭州，因此，今年由春至夏，那靜如止水的蘭州物價，受不了西邊低氣壓的不斷襲擊，遂大漲狂漲，比肩重慶。原來麵粉價錢每百斤不過三千元，不到兩週，漲到七千。加之今年蘭州以及隴東南各縣，久旱無雨，二麥枯槁，春收絕望，各縣報災，紛至沓來，災情較重的地方，計有皋蘭。榆中。靖遠。臨洮等二十餘縣。旱象旣成，糧價必漲，西北的投機商，和擁有大量游資的特殊人物，最喜歡做的一件事，就是國積。他們有非常的耐性，有些山西商人，至今還藏有二十七八年問的國貨。這班人看準了蘭州糧價必漲，於是，推波助瀾，競起囤糧，不到一個月時間，直將蘭州的麵粉價値，抬高到每百斤二萬四千元以上，於是，甘肅一百餘萬的災民，幾乎餓死。所幸甘省當局，對於救災的準備，做得很快，沒有鬧出亂子，大概犬憫災民，日本投降不久，這班國積商居然大發「慈悲」，將他們辛苦買進的糧米，拿出來賣了，最低的紀錄，小麥每石跌到一千三百元，黃金每兩三萬元，陰丹士林布每尺二百元，據說有些東西，是來自靑海與河州。</p>
<p>蘭州糧價在爆竹聲中逐步下降，公務員和老百姓，交相稱慶，投機者和國積者，愁陽百結，有幾個借錢囤糧的，跳下黃河。我曾經以兩星期的時間，調查了甘肅她縣的災情，我認爲皋蘭以外的災區，縱使麥價跌落到每石一千元，但常今冬與明春靑黃不接的時候，嗷嗷待哺的飢民，最少恐在三十萬以上。甘肅鬧旱，似乎是有週期性的。過去的呈災紀錄，說明在三十年內要來一次大旱，十五年要來一次小旱。民國十七八年，閙過一次大旱，今年算是小旱，赤地千里，算是小旱，西北水利問題的嚴重性，是多麼可怕，現在勝利雖然冲淡了甘肅的災情，我們別忘記那甘新道上，飛芻輓粟，由東而西的辛苦啊。</p>
<h3 id="c8">還都　本月底前二千人行 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>

<p>〔合衆社北平二十二日電〔中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁及海軍次長蓋斯，最近曾發表談話，此間認爲足以暗示美國對華北局勢，似已採一「現實的」强硬立塲，且已使華北因共軍集中而造成之緊張情形，爲之減輕，蓋斯在靑島時，曾稱：美軍或將在中國被捲入漩過，一部份觀察家相信，美軍非但不擬撤退在華駐軍，恐反再有增加。據稱：美國撤退在華駐軍，對解決中國問題毫無裨益，反可因此而失去遠柬和平，美國在西太平洋佔重要地位，更對戰後世界和平，負有極大責任，對目前混亂局勢，不能置之不理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十二日電〕美海軍部次長蓋斯，偕美國新任第七艦隊司令巴貝，美國賠償委會首席代表鮑萊等一行，原定昨日山平飛比，當晚出席蔣主席夫婦宴會，因氣候惡劣關係，所乘飛機被迫降落北平，今午安抵此間。蓋斯一行將為蔣主席夫婦上賓，衆信主席與來訪美國官員，對於華北局勢及中蘇關係，不免進行非正式討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁二級上將，昨晚七時四十分由重慶飛抵滬。又第三方面軍司令官司湯恩伯，以趕乘飛機不及，未克成行。</p>

<p>上海的物價，自九月半以後，繼續起着劇烈的波動。上海市當局爲抑平物價，曾採取限價政策，規定各種物價不得超過九月十二日之原價。但自此項辦法付諸實施後，市上不發生物資逃避現象，即有陽奉陰違情事；以是近兩月來物價在漲；一般市民均感到生活的重負。不堪擔荷。目今物價情形，雖漸有平穩趨勢，然仍不免時有波動。蔣主席於日理萬幾之中，對於上海物價的趨勢，關切彌深；曾有電致上海市地方協會會畏杜月笙氏，希望熟悉滬市情形，素負人望人士，發抒正論，聯絡各界，多方設法，協助政府，使之抑低。我們上海市民，在敵僞的暴政下呻吟逾八年，今日河山重光，方慶民生得以昭蘇，詛料物價趨勢扶搖直上，民生疾苦，日趨嚴重。蔣主席關懷民瘼，不忍見上海市民於政治解放之日，加重其經濟上之苦難，馳電上海市民領袖，設法協助抑平物價；誦讀之餘，感奮何似。</p>
<p>我們自先要指出的即是抑平上海物價，市民皆有責任。我們不能將這責任全部推給政府。政府對於抑平上海物價縱有極好的辦法，市民若不竭誠擁護，協力推行；則這極好的辦法，在事實上，也僅等於具文。辦法是辦法，而物價依然不能平抑，市民怨政府，說政府無能；却不問自已對政府的法令有吾遵守，有否協力推行，這樣演繹的結果，受到痛苦的還是市民本身。故在平抑上海物價的努力上，這責任是大家的，是政府的，是工商業的經營者的，是上海市民領袖的，同時也是上海市全部市民的。</p>
<p>這裏，我們也得要指出的，就是政府本身對於平抑上海物價究竟採取什麼措置。第一，凡有措置必須考慮周詳，使流弊無從產生；尤應於付諸實施以前，徵取上海各方意向，倘使這種措置，的確足以平抑物價，那市民全體均應協力推行，使政府與市民交蒙其利。第二，在抑平物價聲中，政府自身所直接經營的公用事業，允須仰體主席的德意，不爲收價之變動，上海自光復以來，物價之所以騰漲不已，其原因雖不單純，然政府自身經營公用事業之增似，若郵電鐵路均加價十倍以上，這也是刺戟物價騰漲的一個因素。我賢明的主席關懷民生疾苦，不遺在遠；我政府各部門，尤應仰體主席的德意，不爲收價之增加。這在抑平物價的努力上，實是一種極重要的步驟。</p>
<p>然而物價的波動究竟不是一件單純的事，其間有各種因素在起着作用。物價波動是一種經濟現象，自然逃不出經濟法則的支配，我們要穩定物價，第一要穩定幣値，依照目前的形勢而論，幣値雖然較戰前降落許多，但近來並無繼續下落的跡象。法幣流通地械的增廣，足以使積聚在若干地區的法幣發行額減低；這是緊縮通貨的另一種形相。在通貨方面言，我們目前所要做到的是防制通貨的再膳脹，使我們的幣値要能够維持現在的水準，不再下落。幣値能够穩定，然後才談得上整理。在平抑物價的努力上，其終極的手段，當不外乎幣制的整理。</p>
<p>可是目前物價的彼動却並不是一個單純的貨幣問題。商品供求的失調，無疑地，也是主要因素之一，特別是在目前的上海，商品供求的失調，其主要造因多半是人爲的。倉庫的對閉，使庫存的物資不能流通，因而工廠停工，生產銳減；各地與上海的交通未能　達，致使物資不能自由輸入；凡此種種，却是造成商品供求失調的原因。積極增產，恢復交通又應是抑平物價的努力上所不能忽略的。</p>
<p>以上所言都是有關經濟方面的因素。在目前物價的彼動上，經濟因素固然很重要，但更重要的，恐怕還是心現與道德的因素，在心理道德方面言，商人不免有玩忽政府法令，陽奉陰違，甚或從中取巧以圖一時稱快情事，殊不知高抬物價，就是貶低通貨幣値，演繹下去的結果，受其害者是全部人民，包括取巧商人在內。圖利一時，遺害大衆。在目前物價的波動上，我們要特別指出這種心理道德的因素。它在物價波動上起的作用，怕更甚於純經濟的貨幣因素及供求因素。這是在平抑物價的努力上所首先須克制及消除的。在純經濟的因素上，政府可以設法控制；在這道德的或心理的因素上，就需要大家的協力。沒有人民的協力支持，政府縱有盡善盡美的辦法，結果還是無法茂澈施行。所以在抑平物價的努力上，凡我民衆，都有應盡的責任，不能將這責任完全推給政府。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，上海爲全國第一大都市；上海物價的彼動，關係各國各地的物價。上海市民在協力政府平抑物價的努力上，因此，負着更重大的責任。我政府自主席以降，關心戰後民生安定，至爲股切。我上海市民創痛餘生，尤應身爲表率協助政府平抑物價；庶幾政府民衆共蒙其利；不負蔣主席的一番期許。我們各人應該先從自身做起，不要以爲人家不在做面我也不做；似使人人如此，那是永遠不會有成就的，這是淺近的理論，但抑平物價的努力，其關健就在這此小處，這些　近處，願大家共勉之。</p>

<p>— 董任堅</p>
<p>我們現在的教育，當然受着舊教育勢力的支配。它潛伏在各處，沒有一個時候，我們不感覺到它的權威：它的權威，和舊宗教，舊政治，舊經濟等的權威一樣，大都寄託在人在書或其他工具和在體制的三個方面。</p>
<p>人的方面，就是教師。假使教師能够代表或建設起一個新教育權威來的，他乃是大師，他決不是教書匠，他當然不是尾巴，更不是低能；他應該是一個響導，指揮而兼戰士，一個科學家藝術家而兼哲學家，一個學者，教員而特別是一時代的先覺。</p>
<p>在書和其他工具方面。近百年來我們中國教育界何嘗有新的創造，新的發明，新的利用！張之洞的勸學篇依然是獨一無二的創作，而一般教師，能够離開了教科書·教授書·黑板·粉筆·紙張·簿冊等工具去實施教學的究有幾人！可憐他們有了許多新教育工具如照相機·收音播音機·電影機以及輪船·鐵路·汽車·飛機，彷彿熟視無睹地還沒有覺察它們和教育的關係，不去利用；只是整天拘禁在字紙麓裏吃粉筆灰，我們應該可以想見舊教育工具束縛我們思想的努力　感到它十足的權威了。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c40">文化界盛大茶會　昨歡迎張道藩氏 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>今後工作有待大家努力</p>
<p>昨日下午二時半，上海文化界人士，假座康樂酒家，招待中央文化運動委員會主任委員張道藩氏。出席本市敎育·美術·戲劇·電影·游藝·新聞·等各界代表三百餘人，濟濟一堂，盛極一時。首由趙志游氏主席，致歡迎詞，旋請張主委對與會文化界代表指示一切。</p>
<p>張氏面現笑容，欣然起立致詞謂，上海文化界同人，在八年抗戰中，大家能堅强不屈，不爲敵人威脅利誘，且能於非常艱難困苦的環境中，繼續為文化工作努力奮門，此種忠貞不移的精神，殊堪欽佩。本人謹向上海文化界同人，</p>
<p>表示敬意。大後方文化界情形，諒為各位所樂聞，抗職以來，無論是重慶·昆明·西安·桂林·等大後方城市，文化工作的表現，皆有莫大的進步。新聞·出版·電影·戲劇·美術·音樂·各方面，雖然受人力物力等種種不利條件的限止，仍然有顯著的進步，這是文化工作者在千辛萬苦中得來的。同時上海文化界在敵僞不斷的高壓下</p>
<p>亦有進步，這是很難能可貴的好現象。不過有一種情形，因爲互相不瞭解而起的隔膜，是要迅予消除的。我在重慶時，就聽到有所謂「重慶人」與「上海人」。我想大概是因爲有少數重慶來人的言語行動不審愼，引起了誤會，以致一般後方來的人到上海，被人另限相看。在後方也有一種錯誤的見解，不分靑紅皂白，把逗留在上海的人，皆看做奸偽或順民，不過這也祗是少數人有此誤見，希望很快的把它忘掉。上海物價的高漲自有其許多因素。有許多人把它歸咎於重慶人的購買，這也是誤會的。我們希望大家立刻把這種</p>
<p>誤解消除還有一點，抗戰以來，我們很多的地方爲敵人佔領，更不幸的產生了出賣祖國的漢奸，文化界也不能免。當政府派員至各地接收之初，後方的報紙大聲的嚷着，爲什麼不把奸僞們先行拿辦，我們要明暸當時的情形，假如沒有預定的步驟，一定容易造成許多不合理的後果。我們要按步就班地做去，在今日無論是敵人的職事罪犯，或漢奸，都逃不掉的。文化界的敗類爲虎作倀的，我們應該很嚴厲的</p>
<p>加以制裁對於忠貞不移的人，我們要獎勵我們必需要很愼重的來辦這件事，最好請文化界自動「檢化」，以免遺漏。至於今後的文舉工作，有待於大家的努力，國內的文化事業，希望能羣策羣力，共同商討，共同努力，國際文化方面，我們特別要注意，國際文化的合作是很重要的，英美都有</p>
<p>文化建設的機構，我們也應訁趕快把它成立起來。重慶國際文化協會業已開始籌備，正在辦理立案的手續，預備還都南京後，正式成立，歡迎上海文化界人士參加。再說抗戰八年中，有許多優秀的靑年文化工作者出現，希望谷位文化界先進領導他們，繼續的爲文化工作而努力。最後，深深的感謝各位的招待。</p>
<p>代表致詞交由文化界代表胡樸安，美術界代表朱應鵬，話劇界代表顧仲彝，敎育界代表陳科美，電影界代表顧仲彝，平劇界代表周信芳，遊藝界代表張冶兄，新聞界代表馮有眞相繼致詞，對八年來滬上文化界人士在種種壓迫下，對敵僞之苦鬥情形，闡述頗詳。</p>
<p>報告兩點張氏於各界代表致詞之間，又起立補充　　　：（一）定於本月二十八日下午二時半，在原處招待茶會，報吿對後方文化進展情形，作比較具體報吿。（二）關於消理戰時文物損失，在國內損失的亦甚多，不論公家或私人所損失的重要文物，希望都報吿政府機關，將來可有淸理償還機會。最後表演雜要　目，至五時許始　歡而散。</p>

<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>在昨天的自由談中，編者提到了編報紙副刋的幾個簡單的原則。春秋是申報的另外一個副刋，當然也準備照着這些原則去編選稿件。但是我們希望自由談與春秋，在相當的範圍內，會各有各的性格。</p>
<p>自由談注重知識的介紹和新聞背景的報導，春秋將多刋短篇的文藝小品，雜感，隨筆，以及青年修養一類的文章。我們希望自由談像一份豐盛的小菜，而春秋則像一碗較清淡的酸辣湯，稍帶着刺戟性，有提神和發人深省的作用。春秋每星期一三五見報，自由談每星期二四六見報，星期日則刋遊藝界，使讀者得個休息身心和調　生活的機會。我們希望在這樣的調配之下，申報的幾個副刋，多少可以供應讀者每天所需要的精神糧食。</p>
<p>文藝小品是一種水準較高的讀物，但是我們希望春秋所刋的文字，都能活潑動人，深入淺出，不呆板，不沉悶，使多數的讀者能欣賞，也都能得益。雜感和隨筆方面，我們也希望能以現實的資料做題材，避免空泛不着邊際的高談闊論。對於社會的黑暗和不合理的現象，我們將予以無情的揭發和抨擊，但是我們希望我們所說的，都是有建設性的話。對於社會的光明面和好現象，我們也同樣將予以頌揚和鼓勵。我們的目的無他，我們祇希望中國能成為一個較像樣的國家，世界能成為一個較美好的世界。</p>
<p>今後的春秋將朝這方面去努力，希望各位文友多多賜稿，各位讀者隨時賜教！</p>
<h3 id="c59">手 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 堅衛</p>
<p>沙藍給我看她的手，纖小的蒼白得沒有血色。我愛這雙手，因為它們曾經為我在奶色的琴鍵上按出不少的世界名曲。</p>
<p>可是沙藍不是以她的美麗的手來驕倣。她躺在病床上，看見我去探望她，她很快樂，伸出手來給我看道：</p>
<p>『你不必問別的，看我蒼白的手的醜陋，你知道我曾經怎樣的病過。』</p>
<p>她這話說得很聰明。我幾科每天去看她，從來不曾注意她的雙手。當我問她的病情時，她總是慘慘的微笑。我愛她的縐着額的笑容，有時那上面有病色的紅暈。</p>
<p>『讓我吻吻你的手，』我說</p>
<p>她把手趕快縮了進去。</p>
<p>『不要碰我的手。能讓我現在按一按琴該是多好呢。』</p>
<p>我又注意她病後初愈的臉容。沒有人能讀出和講出她現在的渴望表情。我按按她的手，默默地去開開琴蓋，我用食指按了一下，一聲單調的音節揚了開去。</p>
<p>她的臉上露出極度的快樂。『我多麽歡喜我又能聽見這樂音，』她笑着說。『我病了這麽久，沒有人曾為我彈出這麽一個單音。』</p>
<p>『可是如果我能用自己的手像從前一樣靈活的彈出幾個名曲，該多麽好！』這次她的聲音里沒有快樂的成份。</p>
<p>她在看她自己的手，那軟弱的纖白的手。一位鋼琴家的手便是她的生命。</p>
<p>我向她表示同情。因為我想望她為我彈曲。可是我不能對她的失去了力的鋼琴家的手有所帮助。</p>
<p>『為什麽不能使我在你病愈之後，像從前一樣的享受你的藝術的講話呢？』我茫然的說。</p>
<p>沙藍不　，茫然地伸出她的手。這是一雙病後的軟弱的手，需要浩氣休養和血液，如果它們的主人不想　傷她的藝術的生命。</p>
<h3 id="c60">小雨點 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>一　黃金，白玉，地</p>
<p>『什麽是你最愛的？』我問她們，那三個不同姓的小姊妹。</p>
<p>『我最愛白玉。』凱藍說。</p>
<p>依藍半　上眼，埀下長長的睫毛，略微思索了片刻；她告訴我：『美好的地。』</p>
<p>我怔住了，怎麽這樣三個有清清白白靈魂的女兒，也會如此世俗的想法？怪不得……啊！真怪不得！</p>
<p>她們微笑起來，會心的，智慧的一笑；為我加上註解：</p>
<p>『我愛黃金一樣的心腸。』</p>
<p>『我愛白玉一樣的思想。』</p>
<p>『我愛美好的地——我們的家鄉。』</p>
<p>二　鳳仙花</p>
<p>鳳仙花！托南風的福，將你的種籽播送得遠遠的，遠遠的……</p>
<p>然而鳳仙幽怨的說：『全是去年夏末，南風將我吹到這冷靜的角落，牆脚下。』</p>
<p>如果你無心留給人一絲不快，他將永遠記得，即使你曾經予他以天大的恩惠。</p>
<p>這世界是這樣的荒凉。怪不得南風吹過，都帶有如許惆悵。</p>
<p>三　舟子的話</p>
<p>在金色的斜照中，我遇見了那年青人，這剛習會撐船的舟子。</p>
<p>他拭着額角上的汗珠。</p>
<p>『覺得累嗎？』</p>
<p>『有點兒乏，』他回答我。</p>
<p>『今天遇着了逆風。』</p>
<p>『順風比逆風省勁兒得多？』</p>
<p>『可不是，不遇着逆風，就不知道在河裏撐動這隻船要經過多大的困難；要老是一帆風順，就沒那麽如意的事。』</p>
<p>我如有所得。感謝這舟子的指示。我們在茫茫的人海裏浮沈，情景與此無異，這幾句簡單而又深刻的話，願每一個人海的舟子能够全都記得。</p>

<p>河岸上，一大羣黝黑的縴伕們，在繩索下搖搖擺擺向前蠕動，歌聲在空中盪揚着。</p>
<p>他們光着脚，褲筒捲得高高的，一步一步在野草荆籐之間跨着，脚指踢在碎石上，破了，漂出血來，一脚踏下去，沙土塗染了傷口。</p>
<p>遇到逆流時，他們的背伏得更低了，幾乎將鼻子觸着水面，急湍的水流，在脚下衝擊着，他們覺得有些錯暈，然而他們屛住氣，一步一步向前拉去，水花捲了起來。</p>
<p>下雪天，河岸上結了一層冰，他們默默地在上面走着，脚底凍得爆裂了，鮮紅的血滴在冰地上，一長串的血斑，沿着他們的路程滲潤着。</p>
<p>他們整年流着汗，整年勞働着，而整年挨着餓。他們似乎並不是為了生活而拉縴，僅僅是為了使那少數乘在船上的人覺得方便，舒適。他們帶他們前進，以自己的辛勞替他們換取安適。</p>
<p>他們是船的主人，而他們却做了船的客人的奴隸。</p>

<p>但在這時候門開了，花子望出來，和服外面罩着一件深藍的絨綫衫。她親熱地走過來，挽住了他的臂，默默地微笑着。他是在美國遇見花子的，但直到他確實知道她是個日本人以後才愛上了她。如果她的種族不純，他的父親無論如何是不會容她的。他常常獃想自己如果不曾遇到花子，不知要和什麽人結婚，更奇怪自己怎麽會在極其偶然的機會中，在一個美國教授的家裏發現了她。那美國教授和他的太太是很和氣的人，一心想替他們的幾個外國學生帮點忙，那幾個學生雖然覺得討厭，可是也接受了他這份好意。貞雄常常告訴花子，那天晚上他　幾乎不去哈萊教授的家裏，因為那裏房間又小，菜又壞，而那教授太太又老是嘮嘮叨叨的。可是他終於去了，在那裏看見了花子，那時她是一個新學生，他覺得如果可能的話，他會愛上她的。</p>
<p>現在他感覺到她把手擱在他的臂上，也感到這舉動所給他的愉快，雖然他們結婚多年，已經有了兩個孩子。他們不曾在美國忽忽結婚。他們畢業以後回到日本，見了他的父親以後，婚事才照舊式的日本風俗進行起來，雖然貞雄和花子事前早就談過一切了。他們過得十分美滿。她將臉依偎在他的臂上。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，他們兩人同時看見有一件黑的東西從霧裏出來，是一個人。他是從海中被拋出來的——好像是被一塊暗礁拋出來的。他蹌蹌踉踉走了幾步，他的身體在霧中畫出輪廓，他的兩臂高舉頭上。一陣成捲的霧又將他遮掩了起來。</p>
<p>『那是誰？』花子喊起來。她放開了貞雄的手臂，兩人都伏在洋台的欄杆上。現在他們又看見他了。這人正用雙手兩膝在爬。後來他們見他向前仆倒，就此躺着不動了。</p>
<p>『也許是個被大浪冲下船來的漁夫。』貞雄道。他趕快跑下階去，花子跟在後面，她的寬袖飛飄着。左右一二哩外有漁家的村落，但是這裏祇有空寂的海岸，有着危險的岩石。近岸的波濤中充滿了亂釘似的岩石。這人總算從這些岩石中間過來了，他一定受傷得很厲害了。</p>
<p>當他們走近他去時，就知道他們的確猜得不錯。在他一邊的沙上已給血染得殷紅了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Du Yuming Commands in Suizhong; National Army Advances Below Xingcheng, Pressing on Lian Mountain; Tense Atmosphere Surrounds Jinzhou and Nan Kou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] It is widely rumored that the Soviet Union's response to the Central Government has been delivered, stating that it guarantees non-interference with the Central Army entering the Nine Northeastern Provinces and will abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty. However, the airport near Changchun presents operational difficulties, so air transport cannot yet be effectively realized. The Communist army is currently building defensive fortifications in the Shenyang area. Du Yuming's forces have advanced to Lian Mountain and are continuing towards Huludao. Communist army movements are frequent around Jinzhou and Nan Kou, and the situation is extremely tense. The Communist army on the northern shore of the Shandong Peninsula is commandeering all ships to travel between the Shandong Peninsula and Liaodong Peninsula. Contact has been made in various areas of northern Shandong. The Central Army has entered Yucheng, and attacks are encountered everywhere on the North China transportation lines. Except for air transport, the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao route and the Beining Road have been impassable for the past week, with the tracks frequently damaged.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Military news: After the National Army entered the Northeast, it occupied Xingcheng, 180 li outside the Great Wall, and is advancing towards Lian Mountain, 45 li away. Xingcheng is a key town on the Beining Road, and Lian Mountain is only 24 li from Huludao, which the army controls. After the National Army recovers Huludao, it can gain a landing base. At the same time, another National Army is concentrating towards Nan Kou to advance on Zhangjiakou, which is occupied by the Communist army. It is reported that the Chinese side has requested Soviet permission for the air transport of 45,000 National Army soldiers to Shenyang. In addition, the defending forces of Baotou and Gui Sui have repeatedly repelled the Communist army's new offensive.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 22nd] The National Army entered the Nine Northeastern Provinces today and is advancing towards Jinzhou, a vital point on the Beining Road. It is expected that the Communist army will put up a strong resistance there. Another National Army force has outflanked the railway and reached Suizhong, 135 li north of Shanhaiguan. So far, there have been no major battles between the two sides. According to a certain foreigner who came to Tianjin from the Northeast, the Eighth Route Army in the Nine Northeastern Provinces receives direct and indirect supplies from individual Soviet soldiers. This foreigner was repatriated and came to Tianjin. The Communist army's withdrawal from Central China in recent weeks suggests that they will spare no expense to protect the Northeast, and their elite troops are now concentrated in Shenyang and Harbin.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Well-informed sources claim that Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, is personally directing operations in Suizhong and is expected to occupy Huludao soon and attack Jinzhou within four to five days. At the same time, it is also rumored that Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist army, has arrived in Shenyang to personally command the Northeast war. The National Army vanguard is only 105 li from Jinzhou, and a major battle is predicted to unfold there. Well-informed sources say that the armed Communist army in the Northeast numbers only 500,000, which is not a strong force. Moreover, some of these 500,000 are former soldiers of the puppet "Manchukuo" army and workers from various factories, and their loyalty to the Communist army is questionable.</p>
<h3 id="e2">No Progress in Sino-Soviet Negotiations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 22nd] Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Kai stated yesterday that negotiations between Chongqing and Moscow are still ongoing regarding the issue of the National Army taking over the Soviet-occupied areas in the Northeast. Regarding the Vietnam issue, Liu stated that the government is still consulting with the French authorities to discuss the withdrawal of the National Army from Vietnam and other matters related to overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Liu also stated that a final decision has not yet been made regarding China sending a diplomatic envoy to Siam. China has also not officially recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] According to the *Shishi Xinbao*, China and the Soviet Union have recently been conducting negotiations on the Nine Northeastern Provinces issue in Chongqing, Moscow, and Washington. The atmosphere in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is tense, with lights burning all night. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, there is still no progress in the negotiations regarding the National Army entering the Nine Northeastern Provinces. When a reporter asked whether negotiations were necessary, given that the Soviet Union had declared its respect for China's full sovereignty in the Nine Northeastern Provinces and recognized its territorial and administrative integrity, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the spokesperson declined to answer.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 22nd] According to a certain newspaper, negotiations on the Northeast issue are currently underway in Chongqing, Moscow, and Washington. In Chongqing, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie represents Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and meets with Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, almost daily. In Washington, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wei Daoming, is also holding talks with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. Those responsible for negotiations in Moscow are Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Commander Wang of the Hainan Island Guerrilla Command recently announced to the press that the Japanese army on the island has been completely disarmed. It is said that the Communist army there is obstructing the authorities' takeover of seaports, airports, railways, and factories that have already been taken over by stirring up strikes. Commander Wang also said that he will soon go to Chongqing to report on the war and intends to ask Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to refer to the example of Taiwan and establish Hainan as a province. He said that by the time of the Japanese surrender, the Japanese had completed one-third of their six-year construction plan for Hainan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] The Political Consultative Conference has been postponed until the first of next month because Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai requested to return to Yan'an for instructions on the list of attendees and other matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Chu Fucheng, Director of the Guizhou District of the National Senate's Economic Promotion Committee, arrived in Chongqing by plane from Kunming on the 21st. He stated that he is eager to provide some opinions outside the conference as a non-representative when the Political Consultative Conference is convened. He believes that China cannot tolerate any more wars after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, as this would hinder the progress of national construction. Humanity should also make the greatest effort to avoid the catastrophe of a third world war. All problems should be resolved through political consultation, and war must not be resorted to.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Luohe, 22nd] (1) Li Xiannian's main force of the Communist army, totaling more than ten regiments, has gathered in the Huyangzhen and Heilongmiao area northeast of Zaoyang and is constantly attacking, with fierce fighting. A regiment of the Communist army's Pi Dingjun's force has infiltrated Zaoyang from Pingshi, southwest of Biyang, to support Li's force in its operations. (2) More than 4,000 Communist troops, equipped with more than 40 light and heavy machine guns and more than 10 mortars, occupied Lishan and Sanlicheng in eastern Hubei on the 3rd. Four regiments of the Communist army are now concentrated in Lishan. (3) Shuibichong and Panxindian south of Luoshan City in southern Henan have recently been surrounded by the Communist army, and Jingfu County is also under siege. (4) More than 200 Communist troops in Huangwenshan south of Wulidian in Xinyang are causing disturbances everywhere.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] (1) When the Communist army attacked Taikang, the National Army seized its important documents, including an instruction from the YU East Office of the JILUYU Administrative Office of the Communist Army, which arbitrarily changed the names of the counties in eastern Henan. Qi County was changed to Zhipu, Chenliu to Kewei, Tongxu to Dasheng, Fugou to Taixi, Huaiyang to Huaitai, and Taikang to Qingyang, deliberately confusing the names to disrupt our administrative system. (2) Since last month, the Communist army in Chayashan, west of Suiping, has been forcibly collecting grain, regardless of the amount of land, and assigning each village to pay tens of thousands of catties. They also levy heavy amounts for cotton clothing and shoe materials. (3) Shahedian, under the jurisdiction of Suiping, was attacked by the Communist army at the end of last month, and many goods were looted from merchants and civilians, and many family members of public school personnel were killed. (4) In Liuzhuang, under the jurisdiction of Queshan, the Communist army is forcing people to pay grain, with each mu of land paying 160 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] In order to prevent the National Army from entering and recovering the areas, the Communist army has recently organized "Transportation Control Teams" in various areas to carry out sabotage. Its highest command organization is the District Regiment Headquarters, which has a "Staff Department" and an Action Department, consisting of five companies forming a district regiment, with the company as the unit of activity. It also divides the railways, highways, and main highway lines in the provinces of North China and assigns the Communist Army Transportation Control Team on the highways to be responsible for destruction. In the provinces of South China, the Communist Army Transportation Control Team of the New Fourth Army is responsible for destruction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 22nd] According to Cheng Shaozong, a Communist Army squad leader who defected to the National Army, Xiao Ke was killed by the National Army in the battle to attack Baotou on the 13th.</p>
<p>Communist Army in North China Indiscriminately Issues Banknotes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Recently, wherever the Communist army goes in North China, it arbitrarily and indiscriminately issues banknotes, disrupting local finances and deepening the suffering of the people in the recovered areas. The following is an excerpt from the notice issued by the so-called "Taiyuan Administrative Office of the Jinjiluyu Border Region Government" for the issuance of commercial circulating notes: In order to quickly restore the agricultural and industrial undertakings in the newly liberated areas and to facilitate the social economy, the Taiyue Economic Bureau is specially approved to issue commercial circulating notes of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 5 yuan, with all the property of the area as a fund and guaranteed by the Taiyue Jinan Bank. One yuan of the Taiyue edition of the Jinan Bank note can be exchanged for one yuan of the Jinan Bank note.

<p>1.  Mourning Unnamed Heroes</p>
<p>During the Yili Incident last winter, the bandits who participated in the siege of the city, in addition to some Kazakh bandits, were reportedly part of the bandit Ma Zhongying's force and some Mongolian bandits. The defenders of the city were the 7th Reserve Division of the National Army. The division was besieged for more than a month, and even after running out of food, they still held on and refused to retreat. On January 8 of this year, the city fell. The Deputy Division Commander, Du Defu, and Chief of Staff Cao Rixun broke through the siege and escaped. After traveling 20 li, they could not bear to see the civilians in the city being brutally slaughtered, so they turned back and desperately charged into the city to rescue more than 10,000 old, weak, women, and children from the siege. At this time, the bandits were approaching, and bullets rained down from the sky and the surrounding mountains. Deputy Division Commander Du ordered the civilians to flee quickly, while he led the troops to cover their retreat, bravely engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits. Later, the bandits came in large numbers, and the entire division suffered more than half casualties. Due to the severe cold and deep snow, the soldiers were neck-deep in snow. The ancient descriptions of the scenery outside the Great Wall, such as falling fingers and cracked skin, and the miserable scene of ice on the beard, were fully presented. According to the surviving soldiers of the division, the surrounding mountains of the battlefield at the time were covered in white snow, and the waterfall of blood was a patch of vermilion, making it impossible to distinguish whether it was snow or blood. They fought until late at night, and with exhausted strength and no reinforcements, the officers above the rank of company and platoon leader, as well as Deputy Division Commander Du Defu and Chief of Staff Cao Rixun, all committed suicide to repay the party and the country. At the same time, more than 4,000 to 5,000 civilians were killed, and the rest were taken captive by the bandits. Since the Anti-Japanese War, no event has surpassed this in terms of the tragic death of our soldiers and civilians. Deputy Division Commander Du was from Hunan and was a top student in the third class of the military academy. Chief of Staff Cao graduated from the sixth class and the fourteenth class of the mainland branch of the military academy. The generals died on the frontier. This article is dedicated to mourning the thousands of unnamed heroes who died in that division.</p>
<p>2.  The Disaster Situation in Gansu</p>
<p>After the Yili Incident, many people from Xinjiang fled to Lanzhou via Hexi. The nine cities of Yili were the granary of Xinjiang. After Yili was lost, the price of grain and general goods in Dihua jumped and soared, making it impossible to control. The cost of living this summer was more than five times higher than that in Chongqing. During this period, most of the people from other provinces who were working in Xinjiang sent their families to Lanzhou. Therefore, from spring to summer this year, the originally calm and quiet Lanzhou prices could not withstand the continuous attacks of the low-pressure system from the west and soared wildly, matching Chongqing. Originally, the price of flour was only 3,000 yuan per 100 catties, but in less than two weeks, it rose to 7,000 yuan. In addition, Lanzhou and various counties in southeastern Longdong have been experiencing a prolonged drought with no rain this year, and the two wheat crops have withered. There is no hope for the spring harvest. Disaster reports from various counties are pouring in. The areas with more serious disasters include Gaolan, Yuzhong, Jingyuan, Lintao, and more than 20 other counties. Once a drought occurs, grain prices are bound to rise. The thing that speculators in the Northwest and special people with large amounts of idle funds like to do most is hoarding. They have extraordinary patience. Some Shanxi merchants still have hoarded goods from 27 or 28 years ago. These people saw that the price of grain in Lanzhou was bound to rise, so they fueled the flames and competed to hoard grain. In less than a month, they directly raised the price of flour in Lanzhou to more than 24,000 yuan per 100 catties. As a result, more than one million disaster victims in Gansu almost starved to death. Fortunately, the Gansu authorities made preparations for disaster relief very quickly, and there was no chaos. Perhaps pitying the disaster victims, these hoarders actually showed "compassion" shortly after Japan surrendered and sold the grain they had worked so hard to buy. The lowest record was 1,300 yuan per stone of wheat and 30,000 yuan per liang of gold, and 200 yuan per foot of Indanthrene blue cloth. It is said that some of the goods came from Qinghai and Hezhou.</p>
<p>The price of grain in Lanzhou gradually declined amidst the sound of firecrackers. Civil servants and the common people celebrated each other. Speculators and hoarders were filled with sorrow, and several people who borrowed money to hoard grain jumped into the Yellow River. I spent two weeks investigating the disaster situation in other counties in Gansu. I believe that even if the price of wheat falls to 1,000 yuan per stone, there will still be at least 300,000 starving people awaiting food this winter and next spring. Droughts in Gansu seem to be cyclical. Past disaster records show that a major drought occurs every 30 years and a minor drought every 15 years. There was a major drought in 1928 and 1929, and this year is considered a minor drought. The red land stretches for thousands of miles, which is considered a minor drought. The severity of the water conservancy problem in the Northwest is so terrible. Although the victory has diluted the disaster situation in Gansu, let us not forget the hard work of transporting grain from east to west on the Gansu-Xinjiang road.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] Various agencies have been busy preparing to return to the capital. Officials above the section chief level of the units under the Executive Yuan will depart first with 2,000 people before the end of this month, mainly from the four ministries of Communications, Finance, Economy, and Food. Files and archives will not be moved for the time being. The Executive Yuan has ordered the strengthening of telecommunications equipment in both Nanjing and Chongqing. In the future, the files will be accessed using telegraphs and wireless telephones as much as possible. The distribution of office buildings for various agencies after arriving in Nanjing is being discussed by Mayor Ma with the heads of various agencies based on the actual situation of receiving enemy and puppet property, and a unified allocation method will be adopted.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 22nd] Remarks recently made by U.S. Army Commander in the China Theater, Wedemeyer, and Under Secretary of the Navy, Gass, are considered here to imply that the United States has adopted a "realistic" and tough stance on the situation in North China and has eased the tense situation caused by the concentration of the Communist army in North China. Gass said in Qingdao that the U.S. military may be drawn into a vortex in China. Some observers believe that the U.S. military not only does not intend to withdraw its troops stationed in China, but may even increase them. It is said that the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China would not help solve the Chinese problem, but could instead lead to the loss of peace in the Far East. The United States occupies an important position in the West Pacific and has a great responsibility for post-war world peace and cannot ignore the current chaotic situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] U.S. Under Secretary of the Navy, Gass, accompanied by the new commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Barbey, the chief representative of the U.S. Reparations Committee, Pauley, and others were originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai from here yesterday, and to attend a banquet hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife in the evening, but due to bad weather, the plane they were on was forced to land in Beijing and arrived here safely this afternoon. Gass and his party will be guests of Chairman Chiang and his wife. It is believed that the Chairman and the visiting U.S. officials will conduct informal discussions on the situation in North China and Sino-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] U.S. Army Commander in the China Theater, General Wedemeyer, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing at 7:40 PM last night. Also, Commander Tang Enbo of the Third Front Army was unable to make the trip because he could not catch the plane in time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in response to a question about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from North China, said that the information he had received was generally the same as what he had announced two weeks ago, and that reports of the war in that area were somewhat exaggerated. When a reporter asked about reports that the U.S. plans to send a military delegation of 2,000 to 6,000 personnel as advisors to China, Byrnes replied that, to his knowledge, this matter was under consideration, but the number of delegates had not yet been determined. Byrnes also discussed the North China issue, saying that the U.S. is willing to fulfill its obligations to implement the surrender of the Japanese army in China, and that the U.S. military is in North China to carry out this mission. Finally, when Byrnes was asked about the Soviet Union, he replied that there was no progress on the Soviet Union's participation in the Far East Advisory Committee, but that talks were continuing.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Editorial: Stabilizing Shanghai's Commodity Prices <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Since the latter half of September, the prices of goods in Shanghai have continued to experience drastic fluctuations. To curb inflation, the Shanghai Municipal Authorities adopted a price control policy, stipulating that the prices of various commodities should not exceed the original prices of September 12th. However, since the implementation of this measure, not only has there been an occurrence of goods evading the market, but there have also been instances of superficial compliance with actual disobedience. As a result, commodity prices have been rising in the past two months, and the general public has felt the heavy burden of life, making it unbearable. Although the current price situation is gradually showing a stabilizing trend, fluctuations still occur from time to time. Amidst his myriad daily tasks, Chairman Chiang has shown deep concern for the trend of Shanghai's commodity prices. He has sent a telegram to Mr. Du Yuesheng, head of the Shanghai Local Association, expressing his hope that individuals familiar with the Shanghai market situation and enjoying a good reputation would express their opinions, unite all sectors, and find ways to assist the government in lowering prices. We, the citizens of Shanghai, groaned under the tyranny of the enemy and puppets for over eight years. Today, with the restoration of our land, we celebrate the recovery of the people's livelihood. However, unexpectedly, commodity prices have soared, and the people's suffering has become increasingly serious. Chairman Chiang, concerned about the people's plight, could not bear to see the citizens of Shanghai burdened with economic hardship on the day of political liberation. He sent a telegram to Shanghai's civic leaders, asking them to find ways to help curb inflation. After reading this, our gratitude is immeasurable.</p>
<p>We must first point out that all citizens have a responsibility to curb Shanghai's commodity prices. We cannot push this responsibility entirely onto the government. Even if the government has excellent measures to curb Shanghai's commodity prices, if the citizens do not sincerely support them and work together to implement them, then these excellent measures are, in reality, only equivalent to empty words. The measures are there, but commodity prices still cannot be stabilized. Citizens complain about the government, saying it is incompetent, but they do not ask themselves whether they have complied with the government's decrees or whether they have cooperated in their implementation. The result of this kind of deduction is that the citizens themselves suffer. Therefore, in the effort to stabilize Shanghai's commodity prices, this responsibility belongs to everyone: to the government, to business operators, to Shanghai's civic leaders, and to all the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Here, we also need to point out what measures the government itself has taken to stabilize Shanghai's commodity prices. First, all measures must be carefully considered to prevent loopholes from arising. In particular, before implementing them, the opinions of all parties in Shanghai should be solicited. If these measures are indeed sufficient to stabilize commodity prices, then all citizens should cooperate in implementing them so that both the government and the citizens can benefit. Second, in the midst of calls to curb inflation, public utilities directly operated by the government must uphold the President's virtuous intentions and not change prices for the sake of revenue. Since Shanghai's restoration, the reason for the continuous rise in commodity prices is not simple. However, the increase in public utilities operated by the government itself, such as the postal, telegraph, and railway services increasing prices by more than tenfold, is also a factor stimulating the rise in commodity prices. Our wise President is concerned about the people's suffering and does not forget those far away. All departments of our government should also uphold the President's virtuous intentions and not increase prices for the sake of revenue. This is a very important step in the effort to curb inflation.</p>
<p>However, the fluctuation of commodity prices is ultimately not a simple matter. Various factors are at play. Commodity price fluctuations are an economic phenomenon and naturally cannot escape the control of economic laws. To stabilize commodity prices, we must first stabilize the value of currency. According to the current situation, although the value of currency has fallen significantly compared to before the war, there are no signs of further decline recently. The expansion of the legal tender circulation area is sufficient to reduce the amount of legal tender issued that has accumulated in certain areas. This is another form of currency contraction. In terms of currency, what we need to do now is to prevent further inflation of the currency so that our currency value can maintain its current level and not fall further. Once the currency value can be stabilized, then we can talk about adjustment. In the effort to curb inflation, the ultimate means should be the adjustment of the currency system.</p>
<p>However, the current fluctuation of commodity prices is not a simple monetary issue. The imbalance between commodity supply and demand is undoubtedly one of the main factors. Especially in the current Shanghai, the main cause of the imbalance between commodity supply and demand is mostly artificial. The closure of warehouses prevents the circulation of stockpiled goods, resulting in factory shutdowns and a sharp decline in production. The failure to connect various places with Shanghai prevents the free import of goods. All of these are the reasons for the imbalance between commodity supply and demand. Actively increasing production and restoring transportation should also not be ignored in the effort to curb inflation.</p>
<p>What has been said above are all factors related to the economy. In the current fluctuation of commodity prices, economic factors are certainly very important, but what is even more important is probably the psychological and moral factors. In terms of psychological morality, merchants inevitably neglect government decrees, superficially comply while actually disobeying, or even take advantage of loopholes to seek temporary pleasure. They do not know that raising commodity prices is devaluing the currency value. The result of this deduction is that all the people suffer, including the merchants who take advantage of loopholes. Gaining profit for a moment harms the public. In the current fluctuation of commodity prices, we want to specifically point out these psychological and moral factors. The role it plays in commodity price fluctuations is probably even greater than purely economic monetary factors and supply and demand factors. This is what must first be restrained and eliminated in the effort to curb inflation. In terms of purely economic factors, the government can find ways to control them. In terms of these moral or psychological factors, everyone's cooperation is needed. Without the support of the people, even if the government has perfect measures, the result will still be unable to be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, in the effort to curb inflation, all of us citizens have a responsibility that we should fulfill. We cannot push this responsibility entirely onto the government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shanghai is the largest city in the country. The fluctuation of Shanghai's commodity prices is related to commodity prices in other countries and regions. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai bear a greater responsibility in cooperating with the government's efforts to stabilize commodity prices. Our government, from the President down, is extremely concerned about the stability of the people's livelihood after the war. We, the citizens of Shanghai, who have survived the trauma, should especially set an example in assisting the government to stabilize commodity prices, so that both the government and the people can benefit and live up to Chairman Chiang's expectations. Each of us should start with ourselves and not think that if others are not doing it, then I will not do it either. If everyone is like this, then there will never be any achievement. This is a simple theory, but the key to the effort to curb inflation lies in these small places, these close places. May everyone encourage each other.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd Dispatch] The exchange rate between the national currency and the Vietnamese currency was previously stipulated by our military authorities stationed in Vietnam as one national currency unit equaling 7.5 Vietnamese currency units. Recently, commodity prices have soared. In order to stabilize the financial situation and curb inflation, our authorities specifically negotiated with the French side, agreeing that the French Banque de l'Indochine would lend 600,000 Vietnamese currency units daily to the three banks of China, China-France, and Banque de l'Indochine, for public exchange at the legal exchange rate, starting from the 20th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 20th, the China-France and Banque de l'Indochine banks suddenly received a notice from the French military authorities stationed in northern Vietnam, refusing the exchange. The stipulation on daily loans of Vietnamese currency units was also not fulfilled. Our authorities lodged a protest with the French side on the afternoon of the 20th, urging them to fulfill the agreed-upon method of stabilizing the financial situation and reserving the right to take various urgent measures. However, the French side has not yet replied. Our price bureau convened a meeting of all relevant parties in Vietnam on the 22nd to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that concrete decisions have already been made.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Ren Lingxun, London, 20th Dispatch] The final arrangements for the plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations, to be held at Westminster Abbey in London on the 24th of this month, have been completed. Representatives from fifty countries will attend this plenary session. As of the 18th, thirty-nine countries have signed the United Nations Charter. According to regulations, the United Nations Charter will take effect once twenty-nine countries have signed it. Therefore, this Preparatory Committee meeting is the first joint meeting since the legitimate establishment of the new world organization. The plenary session will last for four weeks and will discuss the detailed report prepared by the committee regarding all preparations for the United Nations organization, and then approve it. If this is done, the inaugural meeting of the United Nations organization can be held in mid-January of next year. The various proposals received by the Executive Committee must be adopted after intense debate. Among the various issues, two are likely to cause debate: First, the various proposals for the establishment of the Temporary Trusteeship Council. Second, the permanent address of the United Nations organization. The Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries strongly believe that the Preparatory Committee has no right to decide on the issue of the Temporary Trusteeship Council. The Western European countries, led by Britain, will strongly oppose the Executive Committee's decision to locate the United Nations headquarters in the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch] The meeting of the Executive Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed to tomorrow (the 23rd) due to the inability of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Mexico, and Iran to report on time due to heavy fog and inclement weather.

<p>[United Press, Honolulu, November 21st] The U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines told reporters here today that the Philippines suffered losses of approximately 800 million to 1 billion U.S. dollars during the war. He also stated that the recovery process will be guided by industry leaders and the Philippine government, with the Commissioner's Office serving as the coordinating advisor. During the resistance against the enemy, the Filipinos had two major forces behind them: one was the belief that the United States would be able to make a comeback, and the other was the deep-seated conviction in European and American democratic ideals. This is our obligation to the Philippines. We have repeatedly promised the Filipinos political independence and economic assistance during the war, so this can also be called our war debt. If we have not yet fulfilled this agreement, we will not only break our word in the eyes of the Filipinos but also in the eyes of people all over the world. Other countries in the world are watching the Philippines, and of course the Soviet Union is among them, as well as Britain, the Netherlands, and China. Various places in the East are currently restless and unsettled. The autonomy of the Philippines may be a stabilizing factor, and democratic ideals can be broadcast from the Philippines. The Philippines is also America's economic outpost in the East. The great powers and the people of their Eastern colonies can regard America's treatment of the Philippines as a major test of America's colonial policy.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japan Decides to Return Artworks Plundered from China to Our Country <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Many kinds of artworks plundered from China by the Japanese army are currently being protected and stored in places such as Kyoto and Nara because they were moved there when Tokyo was subjected to heavy bombing. Some of the stolen treasures were presented to the Imperial Museum in Tokyo by Japanese warlords and various puppet governments. The Ministry of Education admits that during the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, precious artworks were plundered from China and transported to Japan by the Japanese army. However, the amount of looted goods previously held by the Japanese government is small compared to those purchased from the Japanese army by demobilized soldiers and wealthy civilians. The Imperial Museum has accepted about thirty kinds of gifts from the Japanese army and various puppet governments in Manchuria and Mongolia, but since the start of the war in 1937, it has refused to accept valuables of dubious origin and ownership. The Imperial Household Agency has decided in principle that all Chinese artworks plundered from China should be returned to China, but it has not yet decided whether to return those looted during the rebellion in January 1910 or those looted after the Sino-Japanese War in 1927. Many Chinese artworks have been received since 1937, but details are unknown because the records are all in Nara and Kyoto.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Britain Unwilling to Give Up Tariff Preferences: The Crux of Anglo-American Negotiations <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Special Dispatch] The hope that the Anglo-American loan negotiations might succeed after British Prime Minister Attlee's visit to the U.S. has been shattered by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's statement today. Byrnes said that several issues involving commercial relations make an agreement difficult to reach. Regarding the current stage of negotiations, Byrnes only said that they are progressing smoothly. The biggest obstacle to negotiations is the British Imperial tariff preference system, which Britain is unwilling to give up without a U.S. guarantee of reducing U.S. tariffs. The U.S. side said that under the current situation, the U.S. cannot compete with Britain in British Imperial trade. On the other hand, Britain must maintain a large amount of export trade in order to obtain foreign exchange to pay for its large imports of goods and raw materials. The reduction of British shipping and overseas insurance businesses, as well as the clearing of wartime foreign deposits, has reduced its U.S. dollar foreign exchange. The U.S. Congress has the final say on tariff issues, and Britain is still unsure of the future tariff policies of the U.S. Congress, so its decision to abandon the Imperial tariff preference system is still pending. All agreements must still be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, which is unwilling to charitably provide to the world without compensation.</p>

Ala quoted a statement from the U.S. State Department, saying that if the Soviet Union interferes with Iranian troops, a period of serious testing will soon arrive. Ala said that the U.S. State Department believes that when the above-mentioned action begins, the U.S. government will take action.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 22nd] The International Tribunal continued the trial of Nazi war criminals today. Doctors reported to the court that Streicher, the Jewish tormentor, was mentally sound. Presiding Judge Lawrence immediately ruled that Streicher should be tried as usual. At the same time, the defense requested a postponement of the trial for Bormann, Hitler's missing representative, but this was rejected by the court. For the first time since the trial began two days ago, the defendants looked happy. Göring was smiling throughout and chatted with his defense lawyer. Hess also changed his dazed state and smiled, talking to former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. U.S. Assistant Prosecutor Storey announced that U.S. investigators had collected 2,500 German documents and would present hundreds of them to prove Hitler and his party's conspiracy and aggression, which led to World War II within a generation. The documents ranged from the notebooks of Nazi philosopher Rosenberg to secret documents of Hitler's High Command, encompassing everything. After Storey presented his views, Lawrence conferred with the judges and then announced to the court that the U.S.'s method of proof was accepted. Another U.S. Assistant Prosecutor, Albrecht, presented successive orders from the Nazi Party, proving that the Nazi Party's headquarters were in control and determining that German leaders could only be selected from the Nazi Party. He also stated that Göring and Hess were designated by Hitler as his successors. When Albrecht made this statement, Hess leaned forward, as if he had heard something, towards Göring, who was sitting next to him.</p>

<p>Starting at 5:30 p.m. today, there will be two A-group games of the Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament at the YMCA gymnasium in Baxianqiao. The authorities, recognizing that the Hualian-Donghua match will surely attract a large crowd, have sent a letter to the military and police authorities to maintain order. On the other hand, the ticket price has been raised to 200 yuan in legal tender to show a restriction.</p>
<p>Starting at 5:30 p.m., Desheng will play Overseas Chinese. The former has such strong players as Lu Dazhen, Tao Shaosheng, and He Xiaoguang. The strength of their team is naturally extraordinary, and Overseas Chinese is also a rising force. The back-and-forth competition will be heated, and who will win or lose is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Starting at 6:30 p.m., Hualian will compete with Donghua. Hualian is far superior to Donghua in basketball skills. However, recalling the previous year, when the two teams met, Donghua was able to win by one point. This scene and this situation are still in the memories of the fans, and Hualian's organizers and players still consider it a regret. Today, when they meet again, they will definitely go all out. Donghua is known for its speed and stamina. Its players are mostly football players, such as Zhang Banglun, Jia Youliang, and Li Yao, who are also good basketball players. When the two heroes meet, it will be a fierce battle. Who will win or lose cannot be decisively determined and will depend on the luck on the spot and the strategy of the battle. The order of the two games today is as follows:</p>

<p>— Dong Renjian</p>
<p>Our current education is of course dominated by the old educational forces. It is lurking everywhere, and there is not a moment when we do not feel its authority: its authority, like the authority of the old religion, old politics, and old economy, is mostly entrusted in the three aspects of people, books or other tools, and the system.</p>
<p>In terms of people, it is the teacher. If a teacher can represent or build a new educational authority, he is a master, he is definitely not a teaching craftsman, he is certainly not a tail, let alone a low energy; he should be a guide, commander and fighter, a scientist artist and philosopher, a scholar, teacher and especially a pioneer of the times.</p>
<p>In terms of books and other tools. In the past hundred years, how much new creation, new invention, and new utilization has there been in the Chinese education community! Zhang Zhidong's "Exhortation to Learning" is still a unique creation, and how many teachers can leave the textbooks, teaching books, blackboards, chalk, paper, notebooks and other tools to implement teaching! It is a pity that they have many new educational tools such as cameras, radio broadcasting machines, film projectors, as well as ships, railways, cars, and airplanes. They seem to be oblivious to their relationship with education and do not use them; they are only confined to the word paper and eating chalk dust all day long, we should be able to imagine the efforts of the old educational tools to bind our thinking and feel its full authority.

<h3 id="e40">Grand Tea Party in the Cultural Circle; Yesterday to Welcome Zhang Daofan <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Future Work Requires Everyone's Efforts</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., Shanghai cultural figures held a reception at the Kangle Restaurant to entertain Zhang Daofan, Director of the Central Cultural Movement Committee. More than 300 representatives from the city's education, art, drama, film, amusement, and news circles attended, gathering together in a grand occasion. The meeting was first chaired by Zhao Zhiyou, who delivered a welcome speech, followed by Zhang, the Director, giving instructions to the cultural representatives present.</p>
<p>Zhang, with a smile on his face, gladly stood up to speak, saying that the people in the Shanghai cultural circle were able to remain strong and unyielding during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and were not threatened or enticed by the enemy. They were also able to continue to strive for cultural work in a very difficult and arduous environment. This spirit of loyalty and unwavering devotion is admirable. I would like to express my respect to the people in the Shanghai cultural circle.</p>
<p>The situation of the cultural circle in the rear area, I believe, is welcome news to everyone. Since the start of the war, whether it is in Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, Guilin, and other cities in the rear, the performance of cultural work has made great progress. Although news, publishing, film, drama, art, music, and other aspects have been limited by various unfavorable conditions such as manpower and resources, there has still been significant progress. This is what cultural workers have achieved through great hardships. At the same time, the Shanghai cultural circle has also made progress under the constant high pressure of the enemy and puppet regime, which is a very commendable phenomenon. However, there is a situation of estrangement caused by mutual misunderstanding, which must be eliminated quickly. When I was in Chongqing, I heard of the so-called "Chongqing people" and "Shanghai people." I think it is probably because the words and actions of a few people from Chongqing were not cautious, which caused misunderstandings, so that when people from the rear came to Shanghai, they were looked at differently. In the rear, there is also a wrong view that indiscriminately treats people who stayed in Shanghai as traitors or puppets. However, this is only a mistaken view held by a few people, and I hope to forget it quickly. The soaring prices in Shanghai have many factors of their own. Many people attribute it to the purchases of people from Chongqing, which is also a misunderstanding. We hope that everyone will immediately eliminate this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>There is also one point, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, many of our places have been occupied by the enemy, and unfortunately, traitors who sold out their country have emerged, and the cultural circle is not exempt. When the government sent personnel to various places to take over, the newspapers in the rear shouted loudly, "Why don't you arrest the traitors first?" We need to understand the situation at that time. If there are no pre-determined steps, it is easy to create many unreasonable consequences. We need to do it step by step. Today, whether it is enemy officials, criminals, or traitors, none can escape. The dregs of the cultural circle who act as accomplices to the enemy should be severely punished.</p>
<p>We should reward those who are loyal and unwavering. We need to handle this matter very carefully, and it is best to ask the cultural circle to "self-examine" to avoid omissions. As for the future cultural work, it depends on everyone's efforts. It is hoped that the domestic cultural undertakings can be discussed and worked together with concerted efforts. In terms of international culture, we should pay special attention to it. International cultural cooperation is very important. The United Kingdom and the United States both have cultural construction institutions, and we should quickly establish them as well. The Chongqing International Cultural Association has already started preparations and is going through the procedures for registration. It is planned to formally establish it after the return to the capital, Nanjing, and people from the Shanghai cultural circle are welcome to participate. Furthermore, many outstanding young cultural workers have emerged during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is hoped that advanced leaders in the cultural circle will guide them and continue to work hard for cultural work. Finally, I deeply thank you for the reception.</p>
<p>Representatives from the cultural circle, Hu Pu'an, the art circle, Zhu Yingpeng, the drama circle, Gu Zhongyi, the education circle, Chen Kemei, the film circle, Gu Zhongyi, the Peking Opera circle, Zhou Xinfang, the amusement circle, Zhang Yexiong, and the news circle, Feng Youzhen, successively delivered speeches, elaborating on the difficult situation of the Shanghai cultural circle in the past eight years under various oppressions against the enemy and puppet regime.</p>
<p>Two points were reported. Zhang stood up again to supplement between the speeches of the representatives: (1) A tea party will be held at the same place at 2:30 p.m. on the 28th of this month to report on the progress of culture in the rear in a more concrete report. (2) Regarding the elimination of wartime cultural relics losses, there were also many losses in the country. It is hoped that important cultural relics lost by both public and private entities will be reported to government agencies, so that there will be an opportunity to clear and compensate in the future. Finally, miscellaneous performances were performed, and the event ended happily at around 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>In order to relieve the poor and unemployed civilians in the city, the Shanghai Municipal Bank has decided to launch the "Small Industrial and Commercial Loans" business. The measures are being drafted and will be implemented soon. The capital amount is temporarily set at 30 million yuan, and the borrowers are targeted at stall vendors, etc. Each household can borrow 10,000 to 50,000 yuan in legal tender each time, but only those who have obtained a license from the police station or other competent authorities can apply. The time limit is three months to half a year, and the guarantee procedures are simple.</p>

<p>Six enemy and puppet financial institutions in the city, including the Imperial Bank, etc., were ordered by the Finance and Banking Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in the Nanjing-Shanghai area to be taken over by the Central Trust Bureau. Tan Bureau was ordered on September 25 to take over six institutions, including the Imperial Bank (i.e. Mitsui Bank), Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsubishi Warehouse Co., Ltd., and Dongmian Foreign Firm, etc., and they have now been completed. Currently being taken over are the Sino-Japanese Trade Federation and the Mongolia Trading Company. The main task of the bureau now is to accept voluntary reports of cases of enemy and puppet concealed property. This type of reporting is completely different from secret reports. Secret reports refer to cases where a third party knows that the enemy and puppet have materials hidden in a certain place and exposes them. Voluntary reporting refers to people who have had direct contact with the enemy and puppet who realize that it is illegal to hide materials or be used to store goods and surrender themselves. It is heard that there are quite a few such voluntary reporting cases, reaching more than 40 cases to date. The bureau, on the one hand, is taking measures to concentrate and sort out possible mobile properties in one place, and on the other hand, is sealing and keeping bulky objects that cannot be moved.</p>

<p>Far East British Shipping has been seeking to resume shipping, but due to shipping routes and shipping rights, it is difficult to realize it for a while. Therefore, six companies, including Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, British, Changxing, Shihe, and Moller, organized the British Far East Shipping Management Office under the auspices of the British Embassy to open foreign routes. All ships of the six companies sailing to Shanghai are represented by the Management Office. In the past, several ships have been responsible for transporting coal. The "Tai Mala" arrived in Shanghai the other day, bringing a large amount of supplies from the UK. The British ship "Alanpe," which arrived in Shanghai last week, is scheduled to sail back to the UK on the first of next month. The ship is a cargo ship, so there are only about 20 passenger seats. Oil is the most suitable cargo to load. This return to Europe is the first voyage to Europe since the war.</p>

<p>The city's transportation is gradually improving recently. In addition to the British Tramway Company and the French Tramway Company restoring the original routes to the extent possible, public buses are also being restored. Yesterday, Yi Zhuozhi, director of the preparatory office of the Public Bus Company of the Public Utilities Bureau, told reporters that in the middle of next month, the Nanshi Ring Road bus will be first trialed to reduce the inconvenience of residents in the area. These vehicles are modified by using the bodies of the former "China Metropolis" public buses and the Japanese military trucks handed over by the Third Front Army, totaling 20 vehicles. They are currently being repaired by the Xuehuali Road machine room and the Jiangwan Road machine room. The upper part of the body and the compartment are painted milky white, and the lower part is light green.</p>

<p>In the case of a Chen woman being decapitated by a U.S. military truck on the Xiafei Road trolley car on the 20th of last month, the authorities filed a public prosecution against the driver, Russian Fei Huofu Siqi. The court session opened for trial yesterday, and the defendant claimed that he had been working for the U.S. military for two and a half months, driving a car for 20 years, and had never had an accident. He did not know that he had committed a crime on the 20th of last month. Only after being notified by the U.S. military police the next day did he know that the truck he was driving had cut off a person's head. There was very little blood on the body, and he did not believe it was human blood.

<h3 id="e47">Mayor Qian Hosts Chengdu Journalist Delegation Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun hosted the Chengdu Journalist Delegation at a dinner at the Municipal Police Bureau. Various committee members and secretaries from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, as well as various officers and group leaders from the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps, along with the Municipal Government's Secretary-General, various bureau chiefs, and directors, totaling sixty people, were in attendance.</p>
<p>Narrating the Takeover Situation</p>
<p>During the meal, Mayor Qian delivered a speech, stating, "I extend a warm welcome to the Chengdu Journalist Delegation for their long journey to Shanghai to inspect the situation in the recovered areas. Today, I have especially invited members of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps to gather at the Municipal Police Bureau for a meal to provide you with a summary of the city's takeover and the current focus of the Municipal Government's work. (1) Since the recovery of Shanghai, the takeover work has been divided into military and party-government sections. The military section is primarily managed by the Third War Area Army, while the party-government section established the Party-Government Takeover Committee, with myself serving as the director. This committee was further divided into fourteen groups, each responsible for handling all takeover matters. After completing most of its tasks, the Party-Government Takeover Committee concluded its work at the end of last month. From the first of this month, all unfinished takeover matters and the handling of enemy and puppet assets have been transferred to the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Review Committee and the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Management Bureau.</p>
<p>Maintaining Local Peace</p>
<p>(2) Regarding municipal measures, upon assuming my post, I received instructions from Chairman Chiang, stating that the only important task in the recovered area is to properly restore local order and maintain social peace. Following Chairman Chiang's instructions, we have been actively working since the establishment of the Municipal Government. After several thorough discussions at municipal meetings, we have decided that the current central tasks are to maintain social peace, promote local autonomy, assist in the development of industry and commerce, reorganize public utilities, establish a public treasury system, plan educational funds, promote public sports, encourage cleanliness and hygiene, establish more public hospitals, construct public housing, complete land registration, and commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance, totaling twelve items. Because Shanghai is an international trading port with a complex mix of Chinese and foreign residents, and especially because Shanghai had been occupied for eight long years, social order and the livelihoods of citizens are extremely unstable. In the past two short months, thanks to the joint efforts of the party, government, and military, everything has fortunately progressed smoothly, and the local area is relatively peaceful. This is a source of comfort to you all. Some may not be very familiar with the situation in the recovered area due to various rumors. I do not wish to make any detailed explanation. Now that the Chengdu Journalist Delegation has come to Shanghai for inspection, what you see and hear will allow you to provide an accurate and detailed report on the various aspects of the Shanghai area upon your return. In addition to welcoming you to inspect the various departments of the Municipal Government, I also welcome your guidance."</p>
<p>Emphasizing Social Order</p>
<p>After Mayor Qian's speech, Luo Zuojie, the representative of the Chengdu Journalist Delegation, delivered a response. He first described the delegation's journey from Chengdu to inspect the recovered areas and then discussed the delegation's observations and impressions since arriving in Shanghai. He emphasized the importance of social order, commodity prices, and cultural publishing. He stated that they would prepare a constructive report, detailing Shanghai's new atmosphere for millions of readers in the rear. After the meal, Sun Qinchi, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, and Xuan Tiewu, the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, accompanied the delegation on a tour of the Municipal Government and its various departments, which concluded at 4 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Review Committee held its eleventh meeting yesterday. Director Peng Xuepei presided over the meeting, and the following were approved: (1) Factories forcibly seized by the enemy, provided that the original factory owner provides proof of the seizure and that the receiving personnel confirm from the receiving documents that there is no evidence of a sale to the Japanese, may be returned to the applicant upon obtaining a guarantee from a reliable guarantor and publishing a public notice for three days. If there are no other disputes after two weeks, the properties will be returned to expedite the confirmation of property rights. (2) If the houses of Allied nationals or Chinese citizens were occupied by the Japanese puppets, leased to others, or forcibly seized by others, the Enemy and Puppet Assets Management Bureau may, upon the request of the owner, send a letter to the police bureau ordering the occupants to move out within a specified period and return the property to the owner. (3) The request from the British-owned HSBC Bank to return the sealed buildings is approved. If any government agencies need to lease the buildings, they can directly contact the bank. It is also reported that the committee passed draft measures, including the "Temporary Measures for Agencies to Obtain Withdrawal Certificates for Withdrawing Materials from Sealed Warehouses," the "Measures for Returning Ships of Allied Nationals and Merchants," and the "Measures for Handling Sealed Materials in Chinese Merchants' Warehouses." These drafts are currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Joint Government-Business Relief Effort; Textile and Dyeing Industry Expected to Recover; Key is Rationing Raw Materials <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The local textile and dyeing industry has recently been affected by a shortage of raw materials and insufficient electricity supply, resulting in intermittent operations. Although electricity supply has gradually increased, the shortage of dyes and raw cloth is more severe than before. To understand the current situation of the textile and dyeing industry, a reporter visited Mr. Pan Shihao, the standing committee member of the Textile and Dyeing Industry Association's Reorganization Committee. Mr. Pan stated that since the resumption of work, textile and dyeing businesses have faced numerous difficulties due to the shortage of raw materials, and collapse is imminent if relief is not provided quickly. The association has submitted requests to the relevant authorities to promptly release and ration the seized enemy and puppet assets at reasonable prices. For example, the dyes from Defu Foreign Firm were historically supplied to the textile and dyeing industry, and a large portion of the yarn and cloth stored in the enemy warehouses was plundered from our industry members at the time. The association proposes that some of these materials be allocated and sold at reasonable prices to factories with superior production capacity to help private enterprises. Yesterday, we spoke with Mr. Wang, a specialist from the Economic Department's Wartime Production Bureau for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, regarding the production situation of the textile and dyeing industry since it started operating. He inquired in detail about the monthly raw material requirements and promised to find ways to entrust dye factories with the dyeing of some raw cloth. He also promised to assist in coordinating with the handling authorities to provide a reasonable amount of dyes and raw materials and instructed us to verify the number of cloth bolts that could be dyed and provide detailed names and quantities of the required raw materials. He also mentioned that adjustments to industrial funding are being considered and planned, and the association has scheduled a meeting to plan and implement these measures. The concern of the relevant authorities for the textile and dyeing industry is deeply appreciated. If raw material rationing and industrial loans can be implemented simultaneously, not only can the textile and dyeing industry recover, but commodity prices will also stabilize due to increased production.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Coal Market Soars Again; Strong Arrivals of Firewood and Charcoal <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The price of white coal lumps continues to soar in the coal market, with white coal dust following suit. Anthracite coal, sold through actual sales accounts, follows the previous trend and advances to a high peak. Coal balls, due to the rising price of their main raw material, white coal dust, have had their new prices adjusted by the manufacturers. Firewood, from various parts of eastern Zhejiang, is arriving in large quantities due to favorable winds. Charcoal, from Yonglu, Linhai (Taizhou), Haimen, and Huangyanjiang, is arriving in Shanghai, and slippery green river charcoal from Yuhang is also arriving. On land routes, loofah-packed charcoal from Haining, Xiashi, Changan, and Linping, via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, is arriving in Shanghai. Shanghai's actual sales accounts are also healthy in absorbing these goods, and both supply and sales are smooth, with prices trending stable.</p>

<p>The cargo ship Quicksilver Victory, with a deadweight of 10,500 tons, arrived in port today. The ship contains 5,000 bales of Mexican cotton from Los Angeles, the first shipment of American cotton since the end of the war. It was ordered by Clayton &amp; Co. and will be used by various yarn factories in the city.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Rice Prices Reach 10,000 Yuan Mark <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Falling by About 1,000 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>According to rice industry sources, local food reserves have gradually increased. Rice merchants and rice shops have stocked large quantities of goods and are selling them in the market daily. At the same time, personnel are being dispatched to various production areas to procure goods. According to unofficial estimates, the city's daily rice consumption is around 25,000 stones. This inventory is sufficient to meet the city's needs for more than three months. The dramatic increase in inventory and sluggish sales have significantly changed market conditions. Yesterday, trading in the rice market was light, with buyers and sellers seeking to offload goods. Merchants' ability to absorb goods weakened, and rice prices fell across the board, decreasing by about 1,000 yuan per stone compared to the previous market. Some rice prices have already reached the 10,000 yuan mark. At the same time, the authorities are paying close attention to the management of food issues and have formulated effective measures to address both symptoms and root causes, which are being gradually implemented. Currently, they are making every effort to clear supply channels. In addition to assisting rice merchants in procuring large quantities of goods from various rice-producing areas, they have also consulted with water and land transportation authorities to allow priority loading of rice and grains, which has already been approved.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Price-Controlled Sugar <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Sugar Merchants Seek Allocation</p>
<p>After the victory, there was a significant quantity of sugar produced by the enemy and puppets in storage. The first batch was entrusted to four major auction houses, including Louis Smollan, by the responsible authorities and was successfully auctioned on the 21st. The second batch is also being prepared. However, local sugar merchants believe that public auctions inevitably result in the sugar flowing into the hands of speculators. The industry association convened a meeting of its members, which resolved to request the authorities to follow the example of price-controlled cloth and daily necessities by selling the stored sugar to sugar merchants at reasonable prices, who would then allocate it to retailers for public sale at reasonable prices, with the aim of ensuring widespread availability and preventing hoarding. This is presumably what the authorities would like to see as well.</p>

<p>Since the liberation of the city, the number of employees of the Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies has reached tens of thousands. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs has initiated the organization of a Municipal Government Employee Consumer Cooperative to handle the procurement and sale of essential daily necessities at reasonable prices to alleviate the pressure on living expenses. A large number of employees from various agencies have volunteered to join, and Mayor Qian has also highly praised this initiative, allocating funds to facilitate its operation. The preparatory work is largely complete, and the cooperative is expected to be established on December 1st. At a time of soaring prices and significant pressure on living expenses, this initiative is indeed worth promoting and implementing.</p>
<p>Recently, meat prices have soared, and the slaughter tax collected by the Bureau of Finance will also be increased, which is currently being studied.</p>

<h3 id="e57">A Glimpse of Market Conditions <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver Coin Market: Yesterday (the 22nd), the market continued to weaken, lacking the strength to recover. Northern merchants continued to supply goods, and prices remained stable midway. However, the exchange rate for puppet-issued banknotes was set at five to one. Tianjin gold was quoted at 350,000 yuan, equivalent to only 70,000 yuan per tael of legal tender. With a constant flow of goods from the north, market participants, with little interest after days of small trading volumes, lacked enthusiasm. The entire market was constantly pressured by sellers, especially in the afternoon, resulting in a decrease of 15,000 yuan per ten taels compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold was also lowered by 2,000 yuan, to 88,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<p>Silver dollars also lacked vitality, struggling around 450 yuan throughout the day, with silver bullion quoted at 750 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market was still affected by gold prices. Additionally, the discovery of counterfeit American dollars also dampened sentiment. American dollars initially opened at 1,400 yuan, gradually rising to 1,405 yuan due to continued buying by mainland visitors. However, the falling gold market ultimately caused it to collapse, resulting in a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars initially saw active buying due to reports of the resumption of Shanghai-Hong Kong flights, but the final result was similar to the previous day. Old coins and small notes from 1935 were about 10% lower than those from 1930. Australian pounds were around 3,300 yuan, while rupees, divided into Burmese, Ceylonese, and Indian types, ranged in price from 1,200 yuan to 400 yuan. In recent days, some Indians have been preparing to return to their home countries, resulting in frantic buying. However, all of these were over-the-counter transactions at exchange shops, and it is difficult to obtain accurate prices due to the lack of trading volume. Overnight call loans remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 0.10, with gold certificates used as collateral. Interbank loans remained at 0.30, (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.9% per 1,000 yuan).</p>
<p>Securities: Public prices remained stable, but there were many sellers at high prices. Large investors were more cautious yesterday. Prices fluctuated in the middle, but ultimately more stocks rose than fell compared to the previous day. The price differences between various stocks continued to narrow.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to be traded privately. Sentiment remained strong due to reports of resumption of operations soon. The market opened strong, but ultimately the negative performance of the gold market made it difficult for buying interest to last, resulting in little change compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fell with gold prices, with very little trading volume. The final selling price was about 0.5% lower.</p>
<p>Yarn Market: Yesterday, the yarn market initially rose and then fell back. The market opened higher because retail shops were strong on 20-count yarn, pushing prices up by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. There was also some trading in fine yarn from big packages of Changsha and inland origin. Shanghai yarn shops were cautious. However, prices dropped by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan as hoarders sold off, and customer sales slowed down. The result was an increase of 10,000 to 15,000 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Spring and Autumn Notes <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>In yesterday's Free Talk, the editor mentioned several simple principles for editing newspaper supplements. Spring and Autumn is another supplement of Shen Bao, and of course, it also plans to edit and select manuscripts according to these principles. However, we hope that Free Talk and Spring and Autumn will each have its own characteristics within a considerable range.</p>
<p>Free Talk focuses on the introduction of knowledge and the reporting of news background, while Spring and Autumn will publish more short literary essays, miscellaneous feelings, essays, and articles on youth cultivation. We hope that Free Talk is like a rich side dish, while Spring and Autumn is like a bowl of lighter hot and sour soup, with a bit of pungency, which has the effect of refreshing and provoking deep thought. Spring and Autumn is published every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, while Free Talk is published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. On Sundays, the entertainment section is published, so that readers have the opportunity to rest their bodies and minds and adjust their lives. We hope that under such an arrangement, several supplements of Shen Bao can somewhat supply the spiritual food that readers need every day.</p>
<p>Literary essays are a higher level of reading, but we hope that the texts published in Spring and Autumn can be lively and moving, easy to understand, not rigid, and not boring, so that most readers can appreciate them and benefit from them. In terms of miscellaneous feelings and essays, we also hope to use realistic materials as themes to avoid empty and irrelevant rhetoric. We will ruthlessly expose and criticize the darkness and irrational phenomena of society, but we hope that what we say is constructive. We will also praise and encourage the bright side and good phenomena of society. Our purpose is nothing else, we only hope that China can become a more decent country, and the world can become a more beautiful world.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn will strive in this direction in the future, and we hope that all writers will contribute more articles, and all readers will give us advice at any time!</p>

<p>— Jian Wei</p>
<p>Sha Lan showed me her hands, small, delicate, and pale without a trace of blood. I love these hands, because they once pressed out countless world-famous pieces on the ivory keys for me.</p>
<p>But Sha Lan was not proud of her beautiful hands. She lay in the hospital bed, and when she saw me visiting her, she was very happy and held out her hands to show me, saying:</p>
<p>"You don't have to ask anything else, just look at the ugliness of my pale hands, and you'll know how sick I've been."</p>
<p>She said this very cleverly. I went to see her almost every day, and I never paid attention to her hands. When I asked about her condition, she always smiled sadly. I loved her frowning smile, sometimes with a flushed complexion.</p>
<p>"Let me kiss your hands," I said</p>
<p>She quickly pulled her hands back.</p>
<p>"Don't touch my hands. How wonderful it would be if I could touch the piano now."</p>
<p>I paid attention to her face, which was still recovering after her illness. No one could read or tell what her longing expression was like now. I pressed her hand, silently opened the piano lid, and pressed a key with my index finger. A monotonous note rang out.</p>
<p>Extreme joy appeared on her face. "I'm so glad I can hear this music again," she said with a smile. "I've been sick for so long, no one has ever played such a single note for me."</p>
<p>"But how wonderful it would be if I could play a few famous pieces as skillfully as before with my own hands!" This time there was no joy in her voice.</p>
<p>She was looking at her own hands, those weak, delicate white hands. A pianist's hands are her life.</p>
<p>I expressed my sympathy to her. Because I longed for her to play for me. But I couldn't help her with her pianist's hands that had lost their strength.</p>
<p>"Why can't I enjoy your artistic speech as before after you recover from your illness?" I said blankly.</p>
<p>Sha Lan didn't answer, and stretched out her hands blankly. These are weak hands after illness, which need heroic rest and blood, if their owner doesn't want to hurt the life of her art.</p>

<p>One Gold, White Jade, Earth</p>
<p>"What do you love most?" I asked them, the three little sisters with different surnames.</p>
<p>"I love white jade the most," Kai Lan said.</p>
<p>Yi Lan closed her eyes halfway, lowered her long eyelashes, and pondered for a moment; she told me: "Beautiful earth."</p>
<p>I was stunned, how could these three daughters with pure souls also have such secular thoughts? No wonder… ah! No wonder!</p>
<p>They smiled, a knowing, wise smile; they added a note for me:</p>
<p>"I love a heart like gold."</p>
<p>"I love a mind like white jade."</p>
<p>"I love the beautiful earth—our hometown."</p>
<p>Two Balsam</p>
<p>Balsam! Thanks to the blessing of the south wind, your seeds are sent far, far away...</p>
<p>However, Fengxian said plaintively: "It was the south wind that blew me to this quiet corner, under the wall, at the end of last summer."</p>
<p>If you unintentionally leave someone with a trace of unhappiness, he will always remember it, even if you have given him great favor.</p>
<p>This world is so desolate. No wonder the south wind blows through, carrying so much melancholy.</p>
<p>Three The Boatman's Words</p>
<p>In the golden oblique light, I met the young man, the boatman who had just learned to row a boat.</p>
<p>He wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>"Do you feel tired?"</p>
<p>"A little tired," he replied to me.</p>
<p>"I encountered a headwind today."</p>
<p>"It's much easier to have a tailwind than a headwind?"</p>
<p>"Of course, if you don't encounter a headwind, you won't know how much difficulty it takes to row this boat in the river; if you always have smooth sailing, it won't be so easy."</p>
<p>I gained something. Thank you for the boatman's guidance. We are floating in the vast sea of people, the situation is no different from this. I hope that every boatman in the sea of people can remember these few simple and profound words.</p>

<p>On the river bank, a large group of dark-skinned trackers are swaying and moving forward under the ropes, and the songs are reverberating in the air.</p>
<p>They were barefoot, their trousers rolled up high, striding through the weeds and thorns step by step, their toes kicking on the gravel, breaking and bleeding, and they stepped down, the sand covered the wound.</p>
<p>When encountering a headwind, their backs were lowered even more, almost touching the water with their noses. The rapid current was hitting under their feet, and they felt a little dizzy. However, they held their breath and pulled forward step by step, and the water splashed up.</p>
<p>On snowy days, a layer of ice formed on the river bank, and they walked silently on it, their feet frozen and burst open, and bright red blood dripped on the ice, and a long string of blood stains permeated along their journey.</p>
<p>They sweat all year round, labor all year round, and starve all year round. They don't seem to be pulling the rope for life, but just to make the few people riding in the boat feel convenient and comfortable. They take them forward, using their own hard work to exchange for their comfort.</p>
<p>They are the owners of the boat, but they are slaves to the guests on the boat.</p>

<p>The essence of being human lies in doing, in having work to do. Morning and evening, diligently and earnestly, completing one task after another, one day after another; only this can be considered being human, this is the way of being human.</p>
<p>The great American inventor Thomas Edison dedicated his life to work, constantly seeking work to do. One summer evening, he returned home after finishing work, looking very tired. His wife said to him, "You work too hard, you should go on a vacation." Edison asked, "Where should I go?" His wife said, "Decide for yourself on a place you think is suitable." Edison nodded and said, "Okay! Then I will go tomorrow." The next morning, he returned to his usual laboratory for work.</p>
<p>Work, work, constantly working. Edison's success is the best example for young people around the world.</p>
<p>Young people, may you strive to find work to do! May you strive to be human!</p>

<p>In the past, you had a bright and long history, like a bright lamp, illuminating the whole country, serving as a mentor to tens of millions of people. Unfortunately, after the fall of the isolated island, you were occupied by traitors, lost your freedom, and fell into a dark trap. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and light has reappeared, I can meet this newspaper again, as if meeting an old friend, and my joy is boundless.</p>
<p>I am a reader of Shen Bao and also a writer for Shen Bao because my writing has been published in "Small Chronicle." Since the fall of the city, I have stopped writing for three or four years, which almost suffocated me. Today, as soon as I heard the news of this newspaper's re-publication, I hurriedly picked up my pen, wanting to express my innermost feelings, but with thousands of thoughts and emotions, I don't know where to start.</p>
<p>Okay, let's sincerely extend our hands, let's shake hands first, and say: "Long time no see!"</p>
<p>Short Masterpiece</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Enemy (2) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>But at this moment, the door opened, and Hana came out, wearing a dark blue woolen sweater over her kimono. She walked over affectionately, took his arm, and smiled silently. He had met Hana in America, but only fell in love with her after he was sure she was Japanese. If her race was not pure, his father would never accept her. He often wondered what kind of person he would have married if he had never met Hana, and was even more surprised at how, by a sheer chance, he had found her at the home of an American professor. The American professor and his wife were very kind people, wholeheartedly wanting to help their foreign students, and although the students found it annoying, they accepted his kindness. Sadao often told Hana that he had almost not gone to Professor Harley's house that night because the room was small, the food was bad, and the professor's wife was always nagging. But he finally went, and there he saw Hana, who was a new student at the time, and he felt that if possible, he would fall in love with her.</p>
<p>Now he felt her hand on his arm, and also felt the joy that this gesture gave him, even though they had been married for many years and already had two children. They had not married hastily in America. After they graduated, they returned to Japan, and after seeing his father, the marriage proceeded according to the old-fashioned Japanese customs, although Sadao and Hana had discussed everything beforehand. They lived very happily. She leaned her face against his arm.</p>
<p>Just then, they both saw a black thing coming out of the mist, a person. He had been thrown out of the sea—as if thrown out by a reef. He staggered a few steps, his body outlined in the mist, his arms raised above his head. A roll of mist then covered him again.</p>
<p>"Who is that?" Hana cried. She released Sadao's arm, and both leaned over the balcony railing. Now they saw him again. The man was crawling on his hands and knees. Then they saw him fall forward and lie still.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a fisherman washed off his boat by a big wave," Sadao said. He quickly ran down the stairs, Hana following behind, her wide sleeves fluttering. There were fishing villages one or two miles to the left and right, but here there was only a deserted coastline with dangerous rocks. The waves near the shore were full of nail-like rocks. This man had managed to get through these rocks, he must be very badly injured.</p>
<p>As they approached him, they knew they were right. The sand on one side of him was stained crimson with blood.</p>
