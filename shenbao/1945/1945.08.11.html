<p>社評</p>
<h3>四論國民黨憲政</h3>
<p>讀畢陳公博先生「國民黨的再檢討」一文，我們不僅知道公博先生對國民黨之嚴正的批　，完全是以國民黨最高負責者，「惟其愛之也深，故言之也切」，而且，公博先生此文，「不專是對某一地區的同志說的，而是對全國同志說的」。其實，我們站在黨外的立塲，對於此文，也有極大的感動，而不覺以熱誠的希望，寄託於中國國民黨。公博先生說：「建國是不能除外國民黨的，反共更不能除外國民黨的。」公博先生因此更期望全國一般靑年「應當盡量批評國民黨，更協力於國民黨的改造」。我們就乘此機會，再　我們愛護國民黨與中華民國的赤忱。</p>
<p>國民黨有五十年光榮的歷史，有無數先烈所留給全國國民的經騐敎訓，有中山先生遺留下來救國救民的最高原則——三民主義，建國方略，建國大綱及第一次全國代表大會宣言，所有這些，不僅在過去，而且在今日和將來同樣是中華民國復興建國的基礎。因此，全國民衆，應無分地區，擁護國民黨領導全國，實施孫中山先生遺囑中勉勵全黨努力奮鬥的各點·實施三民主義，建國方略，建國大綱，及第一次全國代表大會宣言，尤其是召開國民會議，實施憲政，「務須於最短期間，促其實現」。我們希望每一個國民黨員，對於這篇人人能背誦的「總理遺囑」，細細去硏究一番，誠懇地去實施。我們深信，只要國民黨不違反中山先生　篇遺囑，脚踏實地實施這篇遺囑，那麼，任何其他黨派，決不足與國民黨競爭的！</p>
<p>公博先生在「國民黨的再檢討」中指出：「國民黨創始革命·有它悠久歷史，在現代的中國，實在找不出有一個黨比它更長遠；國民黨建立民國，統一中國，有它豐偉的功業，在現代的中國，實在找不出有一黨比它更有勛勞。」這完全不是自誇目傲的說法，而是全國人民所公認的。所以，我們擊誠希望每一個國民黨黨負，能從此以後，提高其自尊心，自信心；積極起來，振作起來。尤其是担負國民黨各級領導主權的領袖們，要拿出國民黨爲一國最大黨派的「風光　月」的態度，收拾起一切對民衆對異黨猜疑和畏　的心理，眞正相信民衆，扶助民衆，民衆就是國民黨永遠存在與發達的基礎，同樣的，以大公無私對待黨外人士，以寬大對待其他黨派，那麼，一切黨外人士和其他黨派，都會立刻變成國民黨的外衛勢力；在那時候，一定可以像公博先生所說：「若是有人想以武力消滅國民黨是不可能的，想以謀略來軟化國民黨也是不可能的！中山先生晚年勸戒其黨員的，就是革命政黨，決不能依靠武力而要依靠宣傳，用宣傳來取得民衆自發的愛戴，因爲民衆的愛戴，才是無敵的力量，我們深盼今日全國國民黨員，恪遵中山先生的遺訓，尤其是在今後實施憲政之時，更須如此。爲着國民黨，也爲着中華民國的利益。</p>

<h3>泰州之行</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者觀光高郵寳應旣畢，返抵江都，隔日（十四）再作泰縣之遊。按泰縣位處蘇北之南端，爲事變後，蘇北唯一呈戰時繁榮的新都市，因未受砲火波及，故當地市容在蘇北僅次於江都。據泰縣之父老吿，本地前此之能倖免兵燹，實歸功當時掌握泰州軍政大權的李長江將軍之苦心捍衛，故一居民爲紀念將軍與李明揚將軍，有「明江路」之建闢，以誌不忘。</p>
<p>記者爲求迅速起見，乃沿揚泰公路乘民營小汽車前往。代價甚貴，計每客單程票價八萬元，蓋以公路中途大橋塌毀，華鐵公共汽車停駛月餘，故捨此並無他法。</p>
<p>車八時一刻開行，車行約二十分鐘經離揚州十里處之萬福橋，橋身係水泥所建，長達里許，工程浩大，係民國二十二年江蘇建設應長沈伯先所督建者。再進八里，抵仙女廟，中途曾經小橋四座，公路離鎭約里許。該鎭在歷史上爲苛捐雜稅之發源地，按太平天國時期，淸廷以兵費浩大，無法措出，常由淸吏雷以誠建議，在仙女廟設卡抽稅，是即後之　金，原係臨時籌措，不意事後竟遷延多年，戰年前始經政府明令取銷，此我國稅制史上之一段掌故也。</p>
<p>軍行至此，旅客須下車，蓋已至塌橋處，汽車與旅客分批由民船擺渡至對岸，此橋名江家橋，據鄉人吿，乃因橋身失修已久，不勝載重，不圖月餘前有黃衣人由鄉運米六十餘一，押車而來，汽車夫事前吿以危險情形，不之願，强迫駛過，致發生慘劇。當時人車同時陷入河中，死傷數人，此亦可對不顧利害，獨行我素者成。</p>
<p>自離揚州後，全程計行兩小時又半，始抵泰縣之北門外汽車站。此段臨城公路，頗斜傾，汽車駛行頗感困難，而尤以載重車爲甚，易遭拋錨。</p>
<p>汽軍站右非遙，可望見泰縣名勝之一的泰山。此「泰山」者，徒具虛名，實難與俗稱「登泰山而小天下」之山東省泰山相擬比，實則僅十數丈高之一土丘耳。上形有似廟宇之房屋，據謂前曾一度爲李長江將軍駐節泰州時，第一集團軍之司令部。</p>
<p>泰縣工商業</p>
<p>泰縣最大之馬路爲明江路，係環城馬路，爲民國念九年沿舊時折除之城址所造者，城區最繁華之街道，即爲　近明江路北門外之彩衣街，多錫箔店與油行布店。本地著名之出產爲　油與麻糕。當地多小手工業，其規模最大者推離城九里處九里　之泰來麵粉廠，廠長爲寗波籍巨商張鳳笙氏，該廠創設於事變前，規模宏大，設至成粉後之打包，皆利用機械，不假人手，其出品爲三羊牌，通銷蘇北各地，前此營業鼎盛，兼銷外埠，據張廠長吿記者，目前以麥之成本過大，工資昂貴，兼以粉袋缺乏，致影響生產數額，現出品僅達事　前十之二三。</p>
<p>農產與敎育</p>
<p>泰縣全縣分十區，人口總數爲一，〇七一·二六一人，縣領面積計二一，一六三·九〇〇公畝，農田面積一二，八一〇·〇〇〇公畝，其耕出畝數約佔總面積之百分之六〇·五。</p>
<p>水田約佔耕田總數之六五·一，畢田則爲百分之三四·九。</p>
<p>農產以米麥豆爲大宗，棉花亦有可觀之產量。米之總產額，約計一一五·〇〇〇担（一百市斤），其集散地以所屬之姜　鎭爲首，全年運銷榖一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇，米五〇〇。〇〇〇担，次爲曲塘鎭，銷米一五·〇〇〇担。麥全縣每年之總運銷量爲八〇八·〇〇〇担，集散地姜　鎭其數爲八〇〇·〇〇〇，曲塘爲八·〇〇〇担。棉花總產量約計五〇〇·〇〇〇担，按蘇北農產物之集散地，以泰縣之姜堰　，東台縣之　　鎭最著。</p>
<p>泰縣敎育因地處蘇北之門戶，且爲軍政之中心，故極發達，事變後卅一年秋季，蘇北全境唯一之公立學校「蘇北公立模範中學」創設於泰縣。初該校校政屬蘇北行營管轄，旋於卅二年夏季，奉令改各江蘇省立泰州中學，即歸省府敎育廳直轄，直至蘇北綏靖公署於客　成立，嗣後該署兼管民政，故本年春季此校又改名蘇北公立泰州中學，現該校內分初高中，學生約計八百人。首任校長陳養吾氏，曾任浙省敎育應長，除此校外，尙有縣立中學，及私立之時敏中學，與鄕賢祠中學，後者經費皆由當地熱心敎育之紳商負責籌募，專爲本縣淸苦好學子弟而設者，小學則以縣立之城東小學較爲完備。</p>
<h3>渝蘇調整關係　會談進行中　雙方將簽訂某種條約</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十日中央社電　渝行政院長宋子文偕同王世杰·胡世澤，刻於莫世科與史太林議長·莫洛托外交人民委長等，就調整渝蘇間關係，開始第二次會談。據此間所接消息，雙方似將簽訂某種條約。關於此點，九日斯社曾將莫洛托夫與新聞記者團會見時之談話加以發表如次：莫洛托夫外委長對於一記者詢問，蘇渝關係是否以條約為基礎，渠答稱，相信此問題刻與莫斯科之渝方代表間協議中。</p>
<p>廣州十日中央社電　據路透社莫斯科電：渝行政院長宋子文，偕同新外長五世杰又來訪蘇，其目的乃在繼續因波次坦會談而中斷之渝蘇交涉，於是最初即於美國精神援助經特魯曼與史太林於波次坦實行原則上之討論後，渝蘇懸案之交涉，將入正式階段。即如最近陝西省國共兩軍之衝突事件，渝軍採取包圍延安攻勢，業予蘇聯以極大之衝動。然此次宋子文訪蘇之交涉，能否獲得成功，英美新聞界皆抱疑惑。上月三十一日之合衆社華盛噸電曾報稱，渝政權當莫斯科曾議途中，突然更調外長，是否含有政治之理由，實屬疑問。</p>
<h3>美渝對共政策一致</h3>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　據抵達當地之延安消息：渝軍此次對陝北地區發動攻勢，並非僅係局部性質，乃爲有計劃之攻擊。復據另電傳稱，國共武力衝突之原因，係渝方反共將領受美方之指使，表示對延安之決意所致。蓋駐渝美軍司令韋特曼於七月一日起視察國共對峙陣地歷十一日後，曾與渝方反共派巨頭胡宗南·傅作義秘密協議，其後復曾向漢中安康之空軍基地，大批調遣美戰鬥機，對包圍延安之軍隊援助火箭式大砲·戰軍·及軍需物資等頗多。故此次渝軍之攻擊，無論軍事方面政治方面言，美國色彩極爲濃厚。據另一消息稱，必耍時美空軍亦有出動之準備，上述事實足證美國與渝方之對付中共政策業吿一致。</p>
<h3>解決紛爭孫科見解</h3>
<p>廣州十日中央社電　據重慶合衆社電：合衆社記者拉布斯四日與立法院長孫科會見，探詢孫氏於渝延紛爭之意見。據謂，渝延關係以政治手段解決外，別無他策。該記者之報吿大要如次：渝延兩軍之衝突，原爲局部事件，然因延安軍之勢力日逐膨脹，竟於渝軍駐在地挑撥生事，其衝突乃自然之理也。西安西部之戰鬥，實爲雙方治安維持軍之衝突，蓋因渝軍曾要求於延安境界地帶通過而被拒絕，但胡宗南部歐向淳化地區開始移動，却屬事實。解決渝延問題之道，以由人民投票樹立聯合政府爲最得當，然即在戰後，亦需經過相當期間始能實現，設若渝方竟欲恢復揚子江南部及北部，當必發生紛爭，解決紛爭除政治交涉之外別無他途。</p>
<h3>蘇省府核訂日用品價格</h3>
<p>蘇州十日中央社電　蘇省府爲抑平物價，安定民生，對於各種日用物品另售價格，仍採協定價格辦法，飭各同業公會將各種日用品售價造表呈核。頃省府已核訂棉布食用及百貨等七種物資價格，日內即可公佈施行。</p>
<h3>克里浦斯闡明英對印政策</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十日中央社電　據合衆社倫敦電，央貿易部大臣克里浦斯，對該社特派員說明阿特里內閣之對印政策如次：阿特里內閣將不致重蹈因華維爾提案而破壞英印友好關係之覆轍，新內閣槪不援取使印度接收片斷解決案之方法。勞工黨內閣頃正計劃永久解決印度問題之方策，於可能範圍，當早日實行解決方策，現在已非計劃片斷解決之時間。總之，克里浦斯復暗示，於今後一個月內，工黨內閣將積極進行解決印度問題之工作。</p>
<h3>重慶物價指數超過戰前千倍</h3>

<h3>政院鄕建會訂定　農業改進辦法　令各實驗縣遵照辦理</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　行政院鄕村建設實施委會員，以秋令將屆，特訂定秋季農業改進辦法，令　各實騐縣遵照辦理，該項辦法，</p>
<p>「第一條」由各實騐縣鄕村特設服務分所，鄕村建設指導班加強組織，切實指導農民從事：　稻作之去雜去劣，　稻作之田間選穗，　被害稻　之拔除，　稻作之收穫及調製，　發生螟害稻田之掘　稻根，及秋蝗之去除，曁其產卵地之　工·標卵，　堆肥之製造，　麥作之選種，及湯浸稻種，　綠肥之播種，　秋時麥類豆類賣食用作物之播種及培育，　勞力交換，即農村中所謂換工及勞動服務之倡導，　　農產製造手工業之推廣，　　其他秋季農資業改選事項。</p>
<p>「第二條」各實騐縣政府應繼續督促農民，儘量利用荒地，空閑地及隙地，種植喬麥馬鈴薯等食用作物。</p>
<p>「第三條」對於農民缺乏種子農具及資金者，應予以補救。</p>
<h3>勃里農見證供詞老貝當聲言否認</h3>
<p>百倫十日中央社電　據巴黎訊：前維希政府巴黎特使勃里農，昨日在貝當開審時突出現於法庭，對貝當元首與希特勒曾於一九四〇年十月在蒙托埃地區會晤之一事，發表詳細見證詞如下：『貝當元首曾對與希特勒會談一事，深感滿意，蓋貝當力求對德議和，我個人向極尊重貝當元首，同時亦極贊成法德議和，藉能避免將來再起戰禍，我與當時維希政府之人員同抱此感。至於一般人往往攻擊貝當元首，謂其曾玩「雙重把戲」，此項攻擊旣無根據，亦無理由，無非誹謗貝當而已。貝當之返歸巴黎，實欲挽救該地之不景氣及維持秩序，我曾數度向德國方面之人員談稱，貝當元首極願與德國合作，並且主張組織法國義勇軍，以對抗布爾雪維克主義。至一九四〇年十二月中，德駐維希大使阿白茲曾向貝當元首呈上希特勒之邀請書，請渠參加在巴黎安葬拿破崙一世長子屍體之儀式。木來貝當已決定去參加，旋因賴伐爾之免職事，未曾參加。」陪審團於此時向勃里農謂，」貝常在一九四二年八月中於迭班爾轟炸之後，電賀德人，是否事實？」於是勃里農答稱，「電賀德人實爲確實之事，然是否貝當親自在該電上加章簽名，我不敢斷言。貝當向謂：「法國對英無所獲益，而受益於美國至大，故我欲使美德兩國緊密合作，」然我知貝當深恨對猶太人之措置，但渠無可奈何，貝當其時相信德國可能獲勝。」言罷審訊暫停，當勃里農退出法　前向貝當鞠躬時，貝當聲言否認勃里農之見證詞。</p>
<p>昨日第一名辯護見證人爲阿卿巴德海軍司令，渠供稱：「貝當元首曾極力贊同前維希政府之海軍部最高顧問奧普亨特，反對利用北非法軍對抗聯合國軍，及後奥氏因深懼賴伐爾之政策，將引起法英戰事而自動退職。最後一名辯護見證人爲杜奈底，（維希政府經濟監察員）渠稱：「在迭班爾轟炸以後，貝當電賀德人一事，實爲無稽之談。」</p>

<h3>改良全市交通的管見</h3>
<p>— 方幼艾</p>
<p>「交通是都市的神經組織」，牠是聯　整個都市的利器，誠然，在戰時體制下是不能與往昔相題並論的，不過在環境所許可的範圍內，我們當力求設法改善。茲略　管見如下：</p>
<p>統一全市電車路綫－都市交通工具，再莫有一勝過電車者，就因其所負使命之重大，所以非歸公家所司不可。租界收回後，舊八區電車及公共汽車仍歸法商水電公司所掌管，此乃不合理現象。統一全市之電車路綫，非但在經濟上，時間上，於居民有莫大利益，即國家之收入也有增進。</p>
<p>酌增電車路綫綫無軌電車多路廢止，這原屬不得已的事，其原因爲受電力限制所致，但是影響一般居民的交通問題甚大。所以在儘可能範圍下收們還翹首相望當局能酌量恢復原有路綫，例如無軌電車中之十八路對中區居民有極大的影響。目下電力雖受限制而各大娛樂塲所都自備發電機，毫不受電力限制影響，無非供一部份少數的資產階級耗費而已。在同樣情形下，那多數居民所切需的交通問題，總不致絕對無其他補救的辦法吧。</p>
<p>改良車　——輛乘客的擁擠，已成目下常情。而在一般有軌電車之車箱，往常有一段是廢止坐位的，在乘客的容積方面無異是擴大範圍，這正是目下擁擠車廂中最可取的優點。「推此及彼」，何不來一次統歸一致，把車　間的坐位來一次大清理，　要不失却車身的平衡，盡量把坐位減少。同時所謂頭三等間的之隔門，（前所分頭三等現也廢止），也何嘗不可卸却，　樣使車箱容積　大。</p>
<p>資問題－車資一再的上漲，誠然是受一般物價的刺激。然而法商電車的定價始終倍超過于舊一區定價，可知其並非單爲應付一般職員工資開支問題，然而歸根結底的說法，還是要收回此公營業，其他如車資售價之一律，頗合目下節約的運動，並兼可訓練一般市民步行。惟對于無生產的求學學生，及工資低微之工人職員車資，當極力抑低。</p>
<p>公共馬車－前見報虞為適應電車減少下的交通而籌備　行公共馬車，在本意上這是當局關心市民的一種舉動，但是按目前上海的實在情形說，這是件非常難討好的事。試問一輛馬車可能有多少容積？一輛馬車可能有多少力量？而其所需要的價值似的說，這些無非是給少數公子哥兒作遊玩兜風的工具而已，對於每天所切需的一般辦公薪水階級，還是無濟于事。因之，我們不會覺得人力車或三輪車有不足的現象。然而對于苦力者的車夫們簡接恐怕又增一層威脅。所以在公共馬車未實行前，再請作一鄭重攷慮，到底這馬車是否能適應目下環境，因爲我們所需求的是大衆化的公共代步車輛啊。</p>
<p>關于人力車和三輛車－三輪車是應市的時髦品，人力車是積多年歷史的產品，但是二者間的風行還是三輪車的後來　上，而其價格却昂千人力車。推其原因，這就是顯示上海的畸形發展。由三輪車公司褪化成三輪拋杠車，這也是畸形現象。</p>
<p>在人力車與三輪車的發展下，適應起軍夫飲食攤小販的蓬勃，以至塞滯街過阻　交通，都是値得注意的事，同時對於車夫們夏令的衛生，及道旁公營飲茶處的設置，切望當局及各慈善機關勿忽視。</p>
<p>自由車實施配給的提議－自由車本來是件普通性的交通工具，但是在戰後百物飛漲下，車身也一　「萬」倍，而成貴族化。平民結果祗能望車價而美，但是車廠中並非絕對無車，但是因侍善價出售，於是奇貨可居，小市民沒法享有，而一般暴發戶及資產階級的公子哥兒們，却以其來作裝飾品，舊的厭了，便換輛新車，結果成爲他們的專有品，例外固然也有，可是這類情形却着實不少啊。</p>
<p>所以在這一方面，到希望當局來實施一次一自由車配給」，對於薪資階產及學生公務員等更多一個能有永久性代步的機會。誠然這是個提議對於少數車行老闆是件不樂意的事，不過對於一般人却是個極大恩典，而在此戰事體制下，當局當力求實用於實際爲前提。</p>
<p>街道的修築－戰後大上海的市容是一天比一天消蝕了，滿街的煙糞溺，銅鐵陰溝蓋鐵欄柵等的被　盜，柏油路的損壞，防空壕的坍毀，垃圾的堆積，以至行人道不能行人，滿目瘡痍，晚上尤其不易行走，逢雨天則滑膩更難跨步，小市民有苦說不出，其中尤其修築道路及防空　的改善，冀求當局能速予處置。</p>

<h3>Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Battle Situation on the Soviet-Manchurian Border; Part of Soviet Army on Sakhalin Island Begins Offensive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:20 PM on the 10th that the main battle situations on August 9th were as follows:</p>
<p>Part of the Japanese air force attacked enemy mobile forces east of Miyagi Prefecture on the afternoon of the 9th, confirming the destruction and burning of one enemy large warship, and achieving considerable other results.</p>
<p>The Soviet forces on the eastern and western Manchurian-Soviet borders gradually increased their forces. This afternoon, parts of their forces invaded areas near Hiter on the northern Manchurian-Soviet border, including areas west of Zilen and near Gyeongheung in northern Korea. Japanese forces in those areas immediately engaged, and are currently in battle.</p>
<p>A Japanese convoy sailing in the eastern sea off northern Korea engaged with approximately 80 Soviet aircraft this afternoon, shooting down 14 of them with no losses on our side.</p>
<p>A part of the Soviet army on the Sakhalin border began attacking us this afternoon.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Kwantung Army announced at 11:00 PM on the 9th: The Soviet army subsequently forcibly and illegally invaded on the entire front of the Manchurian-Soviet border. Parts of their forces successively invaded Manchuria from the fronts of Hunchun, Suifenhe, and Manzhouli. The Japanese and Manchurian armies have united and are resolutely fighting back.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Korean Army District Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on August 10th: The Soviet forces invading the northern Korean border are weak, with only a small number of aircraft. Their air zone is limited to the north of Chongjin. For self-defense, our forces are now engaging the enemy land and air forces.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Northern Army District Headquarters announced on the 10th: A small number of Soviet troops crossed the border line at 2:00 PM on the 9th and invaded near "Pijia" in Japanese territory, attacking the southwest area of that location.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of War Issues Proclamation to All Troops; Director-General of Information Bureau Also Encourages All People</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of War Anami issued a proclamation to all army troops on the 10th, entitled "Address to All Officers and Soldiers," demanding that all fight for the holy war to protect the mainland under the difficult circumstances, and declaring the firm resolve of the entire army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau issued a statement at 3:30 PM on the 10th as follows: "The recent air raids by the American and British forces against Japan have intensified, while they are also preparing for a landing operation on the mainland. The Japanese army and navy are fully prepared to engage them. With the vigorous fighting spirit of all special attack forces, we are confident in decisively defeating and driving away the enemy. We hope the people will endure the enemy's brutal bombing and advance with a spirit of righteous volunteer service, which is truly commendable. The United States and Britain have recently used newly invented bombs, inflicting tragedy on innocent old people, young children, and women. Furthermore, on the 9th, the Soviet Union, which had neutral relations with Japan, also joined the enemy camp, unilaterally declaring war and immediately attacking us. Our army is engaging them and will not allow the enemy to easily invade. It cannot be denied that we are facing the worst possible situation. To uphold the group, maintain the nation's honor, and protect our last possessions, the government has made its best efforts to unite the one hundred million people, and the people must also overcome all difficulties to protect the nation."</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Visits Japanese Foreign Minister to Hand Over Declaration of War; Japanese Ambassador and Others Detained</h3>

<h3>Soviet Province Prepares to Convene Second Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - In order to promote propaganda work throughout the province in the second half of the year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to hold the Second Wartime Propaganda Conference on August 25th.

<h3>Beijing Actively Procures Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>Beiping, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Beiping Coarse Grain Transportation and Sales Joint Venture has been sending personnel to various counties in recent days to procure coarse grains. Due to the soaring prices of all goods in Beiping, especially grain prices, they have purchased a portion of coarse grains in Miyun and Huailai counties, which will be transported to Beiping in the coming days for sale to member merchants.</p>
<h3>Incidents Repeatedly Occur on the India-Chongqing Oil Pipeline</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch, Wettmann stated the following when meeting with a group of reporters on the afternoon of the 3rd regarding incidents occurring on the India-Chongqing oil pipeline: Acts of sabotage have recently occurred frequently on the India-Chongqing oil pipeline. American forces are currently mobilizing secret service intelligence agencies to make every effort to search for the perpetrators. Chongqing is also working hard to search for the criminals.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Northeastern Regions of Japan, etc., on the Previous Two Days; Ōminato Naval District Announces Battle Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Starting on the morning of the 10th, more than a thousand American aircraft came to the northeastern region. The Japanese side's battle results from the 9th and 10th were as follows: 11 American aircraft shot down and 4 damaged on the 9th; 10 shot down and 2 damaged on the 10th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - By around 10:00 AM on the 10th, approximately 150 carrier-based aircraft dispatched from American mobile forces had come to attack the Tohoku and Kanto regions. From 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, approximately 65 carrier-based aircraft continuously attacked the southeastern part of the Kanto region, attacking airfields and military facilities. Another approximately 40 carrier-based aircraft operated in the northern Niigata area from noon for about half an hour, strafing and bombing military facilities, factories, and ships.</p>
<p>Aomori, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Ōminato Naval District announced at 3:00 PM on the 10th that approximately 200 carrier-based aircraft launched from American mobile forces had come to the Hachinohe, Misawa, and Ōminato areas three times from 5:50 AM to 3:00 PM, strafing and bombing various bases and ships.

They retreated at 2:00 PM. The Japanese air defense forces engaged them, shooting down 3 B-25s and 3 small aircraft, and damaging 4 B-25s by 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Osaka, 10th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 100 B-29 aircraft infiltrated from the Kii Channel at around 10:40 PM on the 9th, attacking the vicinity of Amagasaki as the main target, and attacking the vicinity of Kainan City in Wakayama Prefecture as a secondary target. After dropping bombs, they escaped southward. Japanese damage was minor. By 10:00 AM on the 10th, it was confirmed that 8 American aircraft had been shot down and destroyed.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Truman Delivers Broadcast Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: U.S. President Truman delivered a broadcast speech at 10:00 PM on the 9th, the gist of which was as follows: The military agreements decided at the Potsdam Conference must be kept secret, but one of these secret agreements was only known to the world yesterday, namely the Soviet Union's war against Japan. The Soviet Union agreed to participate in the war against Japan before receiving notification of the United States' secret weapon, the new type of bomb. However, apart from military agreements, no other agreements were signed at the Potsdam Conference. The most important thing that the representatives of the countries at the conference considered was achieving victory in the war against Japan. As a result of this war, the United States does not want to acquire new territories or other resources, but it will possess the necessary military bases to protect American interests. If the United States deems it necessary for bases that are not currently owned, it will possess them based on agreements that do not violate the International Charter. Now that the Japanese people have recognized the power of the United States' new type of bomb, if they still want to continue the war, the United States will continue to use this type of bomb against Japanese territory. The people of Europe are now in a very difficult situation. If we do not do everything we can to help them, then the sacrifices we have made will have been in vain.</p>
<h3>Apawan Maru Incident: U.S. Response to Japan</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - Washington Report: The transport ship Apawan Maru was sunk by a U.S. submarine on April 15th while sailing forward under the security guarantee of the United Nations. Regarding this matter, the U.S. State Department issued a reply telegram on June 29th to the Japanese government's note, which was re-submitted on May 16th, stating that the Apawan Maru was carrying UN supplies and relief goods for UN prisoners of war and civilians detained in Japan, and was sunk by a U.S. submarine while returning from Hong Kong, Singapore, and other ports under the security guarantee of the United Nations. The U.S. government's reply admitted responsibility for sinking the ship. Regarding Japan's request for immediate compensation for damages, it was proposed to postpone it until after the end of the war. At the same time, it was also agreed that the U.S. government would deal with the compensation for the ship with a completely fair attitude, regardless of the political situation at that time. In order to continue to provide relief supplies to UN prisoners of war and detainees, the U.S. government decided to transfer a U.S. ship with the same performance as the Apawan Maru to the Japanese government. The transfer conditions stated that the replacement ship was limited to transporting relief supplies and mail, and legal returnees. This condition would be decided after being agreed upon by the Japanese government. When the U.S. government presented this condition to the Japanese government, it also made it clear that the U.S. ship was not transferred as compensation for the damage to the Apawan Maru, but for the purpose of the intention previously declared by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Fourth Discussion on the Kuomintang's Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Gongbo's article "Re-examination of the Kuomintang," we not only know that Mr. Gongbo's serious criticism of the Kuomintang is entirely based on the Kuomintang's highest responsible person, "only because he loves it deeply, so he speaks of it earnestly," but also that Mr. Gongbo's article is "not only for comrades in a certain region, but for comrades throughout the country." In fact, standing in an external position, we are also greatly moved by this article and place our sincere hopes on the Chinese Kuomintang. Mr. Gongbo said: "National construction cannot exclude the Kuomintang, and anti-communism cannot exclude the Kuomintang." Mr. Gongbo therefore hopes that the general youth of the country "should criticize the Kuomintang as much as possible and cooperate in the transformation of the Kuomintang." We take this opportunity to express our ardent love for the Kuomintang and the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang has fifty years of glorious history, countless experiences and lessons left to the national people by the martyrs, and the supreme principles of saving the country and the people left by Mr. Sun Yat-sen—the Three Principles of the People, the Plan for National Construction, the Outline of National Construction, and the declaration of the First National Congress. All of these are not only in the past, but also today and in the future, the basis for the revival and construction of the Republic of China. Therefore, the national people, regardless of region, should support the Kuomintang in leading the country, implementing all the points in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will, which encourage the entire party to work hard, implement the Three Principles of the People, the Plan for National Construction, the Outline of National Construction, and the declaration of the First National Congress, especially convening the National Assembly and implementing constitutionalism, "must be realized in the shortest possible time." We hope that every member of the Kuomintang will carefully study this "Premier's Will" that everyone can recite and implement it sincerely. We firmly believe that as long as the Kuomintang does not violate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will and implements this will in a down-to-earth manner, then any other party will certainly not be able to compete with the Kuomintang!</p>
<p>Mr. Gongbo pointed out in "Re-examination of the Kuomintang": "The Kuomintang founded the revolution and has a long history. In modern China, it is really impossible to find a party that is longer; the Kuomintang established the Republic of China and unified China and has its rich achievements. In modern China, it is really impossible to find a party that has more merit." This is not entirely a self-proclaimed arrogant statement, but is recognized by the national people. Therefore, we sincerely hope that every Kuomintang member can from now on increase their self-esteem and self-confidence; be proactive and reinvigorated. In particular, the leaders who are responsible for the leading sovereignty of the Kuomintang at all levels must adopt the attitude of the "magnificent and beautiful" Kuomintang as the largest party in the country, put away all suspicions and fears of the people and other parties, truly believe in the people, and assist the people. The people are the foundation for the Kuomintang's eternal existence and development. Similarly, treat non-partisans with fairness and impartiality, and treat other parties with generosity, then all non-partisans and other parties will immediately become the Kuomintang's external guard forces. At that time, it must be possible to say, as Mr. Gongbo said: "If anyone wants to eliminate the Kuomintang by force, it is impossible, and it is impossible to soften the Kuomintang by conspiracy!" In his later years, Mr. Sun Yat-sen admonished his party members that a revolutionary party must not rely on force, but on propaganda, and use propaganda to gain the people's spontaneous love, because the people's love is an invincible force. We deeply hope that today's national Kuomintang members will abide by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, especially when implementing constitutionalism in the future. For the sake of the Kuomintang, but also for the sake of the interests of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Trip to Taizhou</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>After the reporter finished visiting Gaoyou and Baoying, he returned to Jiangdu, and the next day (14th) made a trip to Taixian again. Taixian is located at the southern end of northern Jiangsu and is the only new city in northern Jiangsu that has prospered during the war. Because it has not been affected by artillery fire, the local cityscape is second only to Jiangdu in northern Jiangsu. According to the elders of Taixian, the local area was able to escape the war due to the painstaking defense of General Li Changjiang, who held the military and political power of Taizhou at that time. Therefore, to commemorate General Li and General Li Mingyang, there is the construction of "Mingjiang Road" to commemorate their memory.</p>
<p>In order to be quick, the reporter took a private car along the Yangtai Highway. The cost was very high, with each passenger paying 80,000 yuan for a one-way ticket, because the bridge in the middle of the highway was destroyed, and the China Railway bus has been out of service for more than a month, so there is no other way.</p>
<p>The car departed at 8:15. The car drove for about 20 minutes and passed the Wanfu Bridge, 10 li from Yangzhou. The bridge was built of cement and is about a li long. The project was huge and was supervised by Shen Boxian when Ying Chang was constructing Jiangsu in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Eight li further, we arrived at Xiannu Temple. On the way, we passed four small bridges, and the highway was about a li away from the town. This town was historically the source of exorbitant taxes and levies. According to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, the Qing court often suggested Qing officials raise funds by setting up checkpoints at Xiannu Temple to collect taxes, which was the later Likin. It was originally a temporary fundraising measure, but unexpectedly it was delayed for many years, and it was not until the government explicitly abolished it before the war. This is an anecdote in the history of China's tax system.</p>
<p>When the military car arrived here, passengers had to get out of the car, because they had arrived at the collapsed bridge. The car and passengers were ferried in batches by civilian boats to the other side. This bridge is called Jiangjia Bridge. According to the villagers, the bridge had been in disrepair for a long time and could not bear the weight. A month ago, a yellow-clothed man transported more than 60 rice carts from the countryside, and the driver informed him of the dangerous situation in advance, but he was unwilling to listen and forced the car to pass, resulting in a tragedy. At that time, people and cars fell into the river at the same time, killing and injuring several people. This can also serve as a warning to those who act recklessly without regard to the pros and cons.</p>
<p>After leaving Yangzhou, it took a total of two and a half hours to reach the bus station outside the north gate of Taixian County. This section of the Lincheng Highway is quite inclined, making it difficult for cars to drive, especially for heavy vehicles, which are prone to breakdowns.</p>
<p>Not far to the right of the bus station, one can see Mount Tai, one of the famous attractions of Taixian County. This "Mount Tai" is just a false name, and it is difficult to compare it with Mount Tai in Shandong Province, which is commonly known as "climbing Mount Tai and seeing the world as small." In fact, it is just a mound of earth only a dozen feet high. There is a house on the top that looks like a temple. It is said that it was once the headquarters of the First Group Army when General Li Changjiang was stationed in Taizhou.</p>
<p>Taixian Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The largest road in Taixian is Mingjiang Road, which is a ring road built in the 29th year of the Republic of China along the old demolished city site. The most prosperous street in the urban area is Caiyi Street, near the North Gate of Mingjiang Road, with many tin foil shops and oil and cloth shops. The famous local products are cooking oil and sesame cakes. There are many small handicrafts in the local area. The largest in scale is the Tailai Flour Mill in Jiuli, 9 li from the city. The factory director is Mr. Zhang Fengsheng, a giant merchant from Ningbo. The factory was founded before the war and is large in scale. Even the packaging after the flour is made is done by machine, without manual labor. Its products are the Three Sheep brand, which sells well throughout northern Jiangsu. It used to be very prosperous and sold to other places. According to factory director Zhang, the current cost of wheat is too high, labor costs are high, and flour bags are scarce, which affects the production volume. The current output is only 20-30% of what it was before the war.</p>
<p>Agricultural Production and Education</p>
<p>Taixian County is divided into ten districts, with a total population of 1,071,261 people. The county covers an area of 21,163.900 hectares, and the area of farmland is 12,810.000 hectares. The number of cultivated acres accounts for about 60.5% of the total area.</p>
<p>Paddy fields account for about 65.1% of the total number of cultivated fields, while dry fields account for 34.9%.</p>
<p>The main agricultural products are rice, wheat, and beans, and cotton also has a considerable yield. The total output of rice is estimated at 115,000 dan (100 market catties), and the distribution center is Jiangyan Town, which belongs to the county, with an annual turnover of 1,000,000 dan of grain and 500,000 dan of rice. The next is Qutang Town, with a turnover of 15,000 dan of rice. The total annual sales volume of wheat in the county is 808,000 dan, with 800,000 dan in Jiangyan Town and 8,000 dan in Qutang. The total output of cotton is estimated at 500,000 dan. Among the distribution centers for agricultural products in northern Jiangsu, Jiangyan Town in Taixian County and the town in Dongtai County are the most famous.</p>
<p>Taixian's education is very developed because it is located at the gateway to northern Jiangsu and is the center of military and political affairs. In the autumn of the 31st year after the war, the only public school in the entire territory of northern Jiangsu, "Northern Jiangsu Public Model Middle School," was founded in Taixian. At first, the school's administration was under the jurisdiction of the Northern Jiangsu Headquarters, and then in the summer of the 32nd year, it was ordered to change to Jiangsu Provincial Taizhou Middle School, which was directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Department of Education. Until the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office was established in [?], the Commissioner's Office also took care of civil affairs, so in the spring of this year, the school was renamed Northern Jiangsu Public Taizhou Middle School. The school is now divided into junior and senior high schools, with approximately 800 students. The first principal, Chen Yangwu, once served as the Minister of Education of Zhejiang Province. In addition to this school, there are also county middle schools, and the private Shimin Middle School, and Xiangxian Ancestral Hall Middle School. The latter's funding is the responsibility of local gentlemen and merchants who are enthusiastic about education, and is specially set up for poor and studious children in this county. Among the primary schools, the Chengdong Primary School established by the county is more complete.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Soviet Relations Adjusted; Talks Underway; Both Sides Will Sign a Treaty</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, accompanied by Wang Shijie and Hu Shize, is currently in Moscow holding the second round of talks with Chairman Stalin and Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on adjusting Chongqing-Soviet relations. According to news received here, both sides seem to be signing a treaty. Regarding this point, this agency published Molotov's remarks when meeting with a group of journalists on the 9th as follows: Foreign Commissar Molotov, when asked by a reporter whether Chongqing-Soviet relations would be based on a treaty, replied that he believed this issue was currently being discussed with representatives from Chongqing in Moscow.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow: Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, accompanied by the new Foreign Minister Wu Shijie, has visited the Soviet Union again. The purpose is to continue the Chongqing-Soviet negotiations that were interrupted by the Potsdam Conference. The US will provide spiritual assistance and Truman and Stalin will conduct discussions on this in Potsdam. The negotiations will then move to a formal stage. The conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist armies in Shaanxi Province, with the Kuomintang armies besieging Yan'an, has given the Soviet Union a great impulse. Whether Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union will be successful is still uncertain. A United Press dispatch from Washington on July 31 reported that it was questionable whether the Chongqing government's sudden change of foreign minister while in Moscow for negotiations had political reasons.</p>
<h3>Consistent US-Chongqing Policy on Communism</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to news arriving from Yan'an: The Chongqing army's offensive in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is not merely a localized event but a planned attack. Another dispatch claims that the cause of the military conflict between the Nationalists and Communists is that the anti-Communist generals in Chongqing were instructed by the United States to express their determination toward Yan'an. Allegedly, after U.S. Army Commander General Wedemeyer stationed in Chongqing inspected the Nationalist-Communist confrontation lines for eleven days starting on July 1st, he secretly conferred with the leading anti-Communist figures in Chongqing, Hu Zongnan and Fu Zuoyi. Subsequently, he transferred a large number of American fighter planes to the airbases in Hanzhong and Ankang, providing the troops surrounding Yan'an with considerable assistance in the form of rocket artillery, tanks, and military supplies. Therefore, whether in military or political terms, this attack by the Chongqing army has a very strong American flavor. Another report claims that the U.S. Air Force is prepared to deploy if necessary. The above facts sufficiently prove that the United States and Chongqing have reached a consistent policy in dealing with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Views on Resolving Disputes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a United Press report from Chongqing: A United Press reporter, Laobs, met with Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke on the 4th to inquire about his opinion on the Chongqing-Yan'an dispute. It is reported that there is no other solution to the Chongqing-Yan'an relationship except through political means. The reporter's report is roughly as follows: The conflict between the Chongqing and Yan'an armies was originally a local incident, but because the strength of the Yan'an army has been expanding daily, it has provoked incidents in the area where the Chongqing army is stationed, making the conflict a natural outcome. The fighting in western Xi'an was actually a conflict between the security forces of both sides, because the Chongqing army had requested to pass through the Yan'an border area but was refused. However, it is a fact that Hu Zongnan's troops have begun to move towards the Chunhua area. The most appropriate way to resolve the Chongqing-Yan'an issue is to establish a coalition government through popular vote. However, even after the war, it will take a considerable period of time to achieve this. If the Chongqing side intends to restore southern and northern regions of the Yangtze River, disputes will inevitably arise. There is no other way to resolve the disputes except through political negotiations.</p>

<h3>Brinon's Testimony: Pétain Denies Allegations</h3>
<p>Bailun, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Paris dispatch: Brinon, the former special envoy of the Vichy government in Paris, suddenly appeared in court yesterday during Pétain's trial and gave detailed testimony regarding Pétain's meeting with Hitler in the Montoire area in October 1940: "Marshal Pétain was very pleased with his talks with Hitler because Pétain sought peace with Germany. I personally respected Marshal Pétain very much, and I also strongly supported peace between France and Germany, hoping to avoid future wars. I and the personnel of the Vichy government at that time shared this feeling. As for the general public often attacking Marshal Pétain, saying that he played a 'double game,' this attack is unfounded and unreasonable; it is nothing but slander against Pétain. Pétain's return to Paris was actually to save the area's economic slump and maintain order. I have repeatedly told German personnel that Marshal Pétain is very willing to cooperate with Germany and advocates organizing French volunteer soldiers to fight against Bolshevism. In mid-December 1940, the German ambassador to Vichy, Abetz, presented Marshal Pétain with Hitler's invitation to attend the ceremony for the burial of Napoleon I's eldest son in Paris. Pétain had originally decided to attend, but he did not participate due to the dismissal of Laval." At this time, the jury asked Brinon, "Is it true that Pétain sent a congratulatory telegram to the Germans after the bombing of Dieppe in mid-August 1942?" Brinon replied, "Sending a congratulatory telegram to the Germans is indeed true, but I cannot say for sure whether Pétain personally signed the telegram. Pétain once said, 'France has gained nothing from Britain, but has benefited greatly from the United States, so I want to make the United States and Germany cooperate closely.' However, I know that Pétain deeply hated the measures taken against the Jews, but he could not do anything about it. Pétain at that time believed that Germany might win." After speaking, the hearing was temporarily suspended. When Brinon exited the courtroom, he bowed to Pétain, who denied Brinon's testimony.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the first defense witness was Admiral Auphan. He testified: "Marshal Pétain strongly supported Admiral Auphan, the chief naval advisor of the former Vichy government, in opposing the use of North African French forces against the Allied forces. Later, Auphan resigned because he was deeply afraid that Laval's policies would lead to war between France and Britain." The last defense witness was Du Nais (Economic Inspector of the Vichy Government). He said: "The report that Pétain sent a congratulatory telegram to the Germans after the bombing of Dieppe is purely unfounded."</p>

<h3>Household Flour Distribution to Continue Next Week; One Municipal Jin Per Person Starting Monday</h3>
<p>The supply of essential goods for the livelihood of the people in this city has mostly been suspended. Only the household flour distribution continues without interruption. Although the quantity cannot satisfy everyone's needs, it still provides some small assistance to the people's food supply. It is learned that the Shanghai District Flour Unified Distribution Office has been ordered to continue the household flour distribution starting next Monday, with each person still receiving one municipal jin of second-grade flour. It is reported that the price of the flour for this distribution has been discussed several times by the Flour and Wheat Control Association, the Commercial Control Association, and the People's Food Adjustment Committee. They believe that the current purchase price of wheat has increased several times, and the cost of all manufactured products, labor, and transportation is enormous, increasing the cost. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the distribution price appropriately under the principle of rationality. It has been decided that the distribution price will be 2,500 yuan per municipal jin, and the Flour and Wheat Association will supervise the Flour Unified Distribution Office to distribute according to the new price.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Headquarters to Hold Charity Bazaar for Disaster Relief Next Week; Director Zhou of the Welfare Bureau Donates Items</h3>

At that time, it is hoped that citizens from all walks of life will participate, generously donate money, and enthusiastically purchase items to rescue countless displaced victims from their dire situation, so as not to disappoint the officials' enthusiasm for loving the people like their own children.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhou Yuying, Director of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, followed Mayor Zhou's lead and donated valuable items to the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters to help relieve disaster victims, including: * One set of "Taiping Guangji" totaling 64 volumes (ancient edition); * Three inkstones (tin-boxed); * One silver cigarette case; * Ten copies of "Research on Poverty"; * Ten copies of "Outline of Youth Cultivation"; * One vertical scroll by the famous Japanese painter Nankai; * One oil painting.

<h3>Welfare Bureau and Police Bureau to Suppress Taiping Gong Jiao; Severe Punishment for Those Who Extort Donations Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>It has been found that every year in this city, during the waste lunar Zhongyuan Gongjiao or the Hungry Ghost Festival, expenses for paper clothing, silver ingots, and noisy gongs and drums are levied on each household. During this time of wartime frugality, such practices of wasting money and manpower and engaging in superstitious worship are contrary to national policy. The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, in view of this, has drafted measures to suppress Taiping Gongjiao and other activities and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The regulations are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Measures of the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for Suppressing Taiping Gongjiao and Other Activities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau has specially formulated these measures to adapt to the wartime system, promote frugality, and break down superstitions.</p>
<p>All superstitious activities held by citizens, such as Taiping Gongjiao or the Hungry Ghost Festival, are prohibited.</p>
<p>After the promulgation of these three measures, if citizens still hold Taiping Gongjiao or the Hungry Ghost Festival, the police bureau of each district will strictly suppress them.</p>
<p>If unscrupulous people collect donations from door to door under the name of Taiping Gongjiao, citizens may report them to this office or the local police bureau at any time. After verification by this bureau in conjunction with the local police bureau, if the report is found to be true (such as with donation books or receipts), a fine of up to 50,000 yuan may be imposed, and those with more serious circumstances will be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>These measures will be implemented after approval by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Principal Xu Wanshan's Birthday Celebration Aids Charity</h3>
<p>Madam Xu Wanshan, Principal of Qixiu Girls' School, is a distinguished figure from Lingnan. Her father, Xu Yuzhi, was a wise man of the late Qing Dynasty who managed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and initiated the General Chamber of Commerce. He also founded the Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, which added luster to the industrial world. Madam Xu inherited and surpassed her father's learning and talent. She has been chairman of the factory's board of directors for thirty years. Madam Xu has a chivalrous and generous nature, and her aspirations are matched by her actions. She remains celibate, dedicating herself to cultivating talent for the nation. The Shanghai Qixiu Girls' School is where Madam Xu has devoted her life's energy. For forty years, she has spread culture and education widely, nurturing countless talents. On the 18th of this month, Madam Xu will celebrate her 80th birthday. Her relatives and friends originally intended to hold a celebration, but Madam Xu firmly refused. Instead, the celebration was transformed into a gift of money, turning joy into practical use. Half of the money received will be used to establish the Wanshan Scholarship Fund, and half will be used to aid charitable endeavors in Shanghai, hoping to cultivate permanent talents for the nation and to live up to Madam Xu's lifelong ambition to develop education. All of Madam Xu's relatives, friends, and students will surely consider this undertaking to be a perfect fulfillment of her wishes. Gift collection locations: Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, 33 Sichuan Road, Shanghai; Qixiu Girls' School, 634 Taishan Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Personal Views on Improving Citywide Transportation</h3>
<p>— Fang Youai</p>
<p>"Transportation is the nervous system of a city." It is a tool to connect the entire city. Of course, under the wartime system, it cannot be compared with the past, but within the scope permitted by the environment, we should strive to find ways to improve. Here are my humble opinions:</p>
<p>Unify the city's tram routes: Among urban transportation tools, none is better than the tram. Precisely because of the importance of its mission, it must be managed by the government. After the concessions were recovered, the old eight districts' trams and buses are still managed by the French Water and Electricity Company, which is an unreasonable phenomenon. Unifying the city's tram routes would not only bring great economic and time benefits to residents, but also increase national income.</p>
<p>Consider increasing tram routes and restoring trolleybuses: The closure of many trolleybus routes was originally a last resort due to power restrictions, but it has greatly affected the transportation of the general public. Therefore, within the possible scope, we still look forward to the authorities being able to consider restoring the original routes. For example, trolleybus route 18 has a great impact on residents of the central district. Although electricity is currently restricted, major entertainment venues have their own generators and are not affected by electricity restrictions at all, only for a small number of the bourgeoisie to spend. Under the same circumstances, the transportation problem that most residents need should not be absolutely without other remedies.</p>
<p>Improve vehicle congestion: The congestion of buses has become a common occurrence. In the carriages of general trams, there is usually a section where seats are removed. In terms of passenger capacity, it is undoubtedly expanding the space, which is precisely the most desirable advantage in the current crowded carriages. "Extending this analogy," why not unify the approach and carry out a thorough cleanup of the seats in the carriages, reducing the number of seats as much as possible without losing the balance of the vehicle. At the same time, the partition between the so-called first, second, and third classes (the former divisions of first, second, and third classes have now been abolished) could also be removed, so that the carriage capacity can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>Fare Issues: The repeated increase in fares is indeed stimulated by general commodity prices. However, the pricing of French trams has always been more than twice that of the old one district, indicating that it is not simply to cope with the general staff wage expenditure problem. However, the bottom line is to take back this public business. Other aspects, such as the uniform price of fares, are in line with the current frugality movement and can also train the general public to walk. However, for non-productive students and workers with low wages, fares should be vigorously suppressed.</p>
<p>Public carriages: I saw in the newspaper earlier that in order to adapt to the reduced tram service, preparations are being made to run public carriages. In essence, this is a move by the authorities to care about the citizens, but according to the current situation in Shanghai, this is a very difficult thing to please. May I ask how much capacity a carriage can have? How much power can a carriage have? And what about the value it requires? These are nothing more than tools for a few young masters to play and take a spin. It is still of no help to the general office salary class who need it every day. Therefore, we do not feel that there is a lack of rickshaws or tricycles. However, it may indirectly add another layer of threat to the coolie rickshaw pullers. Therefore, before public carriages are implemented, please reconsider whether these carriages can adapt to the current environment, because what we need is a public means of transportation for the masses.</p>
<p>Regarding Rickshaws and Tricycles: Tricycles are a fashionable product of the city, and rickshaws are a product with many years of history, but the popularity between the two is still surpassed by the later tricycles, but their prices are thousands of times more expensive than rickshaws. The reason for this is that it shows the畸形 development of Shanghai. The degradation of tricycle companies into tricycle wrecking cars is also a畸形 phenomenon.</p>
<p>Under the development of rickshaws and tricycles, adapting to the booming of military food stalls and vendors, to the point of clogging the streets and hindering transportation, are all things that are worth noting. At the same time, the authorities and various charitable organizations should not neglect the summer hygiene of the rickshaw pullers and the establishment of public tea stalls on the roadside.</p>
<p>Proposal for Rationing Bicycles: Bicycles were originally a common means of transportation, but after the war, with the soaring prices of everything, the price of the vehicle has also increased by "ten thousand" times, becoming aristocratic. As a result, ordinary people can only admire the price of the vehicle, but the car factories are not absolutely without cars, but because they are sold at a good price, they become rare goods, and small citizens have no way to enjoy them, while the general nouveau riche and the sons of the bourgeoisie use them as decorations. If they are tired of the old ones, they will change to new ones, and as a result, they become their exclusive items. There are exceptions, of course, but there are indeed many such situations.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this regard, it is hoped that the authorities will implement a "bicycle rationing" once, giving salaried employees, students, and civil servants more opportunities to have a permanent means of transportation. Indeed, this is a proposal that is an unwilling thing for a few car dealers, but it is a great grace for the general public, and under this wartime system, the authorities should strive to put it into practice as a premise.</p>
<p>Street Construction: The cityscape of Greater Shanghai after the war is eroding day by day. The streets are full of smoke, feces, and urine. The iron covers of copper and iron sewers and iron railings have been stolen. The asphalt roads are damaged, the air defense trenches have collapsed, the garbage is piled up, and even the sidewalks cannot be walked. The pedestrians are full of wounds and difficult to walk, especially at night. When it rains, it is even more slippery and difficult to step. The common people have nowhere to speak of their suffering. Among them, especially the improvement of road construction and air defense, it is hoped that the authorities can deal with it quickly.</p>

<h3>Sympathize with Air Raid Victims and Donate First Aid Medicines</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Huanqi wrote in a letter: "Our city has been repeatedly bombed, and the victims urgently need relief and treatment. I am heartbroken and cannot bear to sit idly by. I have specially donated four pounds of "Rodinia" anesthetic Cologne chloroform, 372 French local anesthetic needles, 54 German Three Arrows brand injection needles, and half a dozen German sterile sausage threads to the relief hospital, hoping that your newspaper will distribute them on my behalf. There is also a batch of 250 cc Chinese-made injection tubes, although they are broken, they are not essential and can still be used. If you don't mind the breakage, I will also offer them. In addition, I have attached a check for 500,000 yuan, which I would like you to donate 100,000 yuan each to scholarship funds, air raid relief funds, and midwifery funds, and 200,000 yuan to the Minhang Puji Sanatorium. I respectfully ask you to receive and forward them."</p>
<p>Commemorate the Virtues of Our Ancestors with Thrift and Charity</p>
<p>Zhang Baozitang wrote in a letter: "My ancestor, Shen Bo, is celebrating his 90th death anniversary. I have attached a check. In this extraordinary time, I dare not make any extravagances. I have collected 5 million yuan from thrift expenses and would like to donate 1 million yuan each to your newspaper's scholarship fund, the Xinwen Bao student loan fund, and the air raid relief fund, and 500,000 yuan each to the Pushan Villa, the Xin Puyu Hall, the China Silk Child Welfare Association, and the Old Age Home. I hope you will receive it."</p>
