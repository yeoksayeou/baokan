<h3>紀念四十屆海軍節福田司令長官談話</h3>
<p>今（廿七）日爲盟邦第四十屆海軍紀念節，日駐華艦隊福田司令長官特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>常茲大東亞戰爭最熾烈之決戰階段，欣逢第四十屆海軍紀念日，向顧過去四十年間日帝國海軍興隆發展，感慨良深。</p>
<p>今日帝國海軍正與精銳之帝國陸軍連成一體，排除萬難，向貫澈聖戰目的勇住邁進，在中國方面亦確保戰域，克服日益加甚之幾多難關，爲東亞民族將來命運，日夜精進完成重大使命。歐洲戰局之演進，漸次對東亞戰局給予各種影響，此固毋庸言者，惟帝國蛇然不動之政策，依然向東亞自衛之目的一路前進，興中華民國等友邦密切提携，爲十億民族之共榮，打破一切艱辛，決不因情勢之轉變而發生動搖。</p>

<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據舊金山電：美代表斯蒂丁紐斯·英代表哈里法克斯。蘇代表格洛米柯·法代表明哥·渝代表宋子文，將於二十六日在舊金山會晤。</p>
<h3>史太林談　蘇戰勝因素</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　據此間接獲消息：史太林議長昨夜在拉克倫林地區舉行之「勝利宴」席上，發表談話略謂，「蘇聯民衆對於政府有不移之信心，實爲此次我國戰勝之要素。我政府當局過去亦曾有失策之舉動，即在一九四一與一九四二年間，我國確陷於狼狽情勢中，此時我國軍祗得後退，同時放棄多數之村落鄉鎭，然我蘇聯民衆並不怨尤，終於忍受最大　牲，博得戰敗德國之成果。」最後渠結束云：「此項對政府之信心，巳被證實爲我人戰勝法西斯主義之決定性耍素。」</p>
<h3>團結東亞民族　摧毀驕敵英美　松島部長在海軍節演講詞</h3>
<p>日松島艦隊報道部長講詞：「當此大東亞戰爭進入決戰階段下，逢迎日本第四十屆海軍節，承中國新聞協會上海區分會主持演講會紀念，並蒙諸君熟烈參加，本人殊表感謝。</p>
<h3>東亞各國共同努力</h3>
<p>今日本人深感最有意義者厥爲在四十年前之日本，爲爭取國家本身興亡而作戰，而在今日則爲大東亞民族而作戰。日本爲求全東亞民族自存目衛起見，不惜向英美敵人作艱苦之奮戰，鈴木首相曾披瀝奮戰到底之決意，以爭取勝利而奮鬥。</p>
<p>今日本對此信念決予貫澈外，並希望盟邦中國及其他各國共同努力。蓋日本向英美之作戰，勿以目前之利害視之，吾人應爲將來整個東亞民族打算而貫澈吾人之信念，況目前英美之艦隊軍需物資及兵力消耗已極大。</p>
<h3>敵方已感精疲力竭</h3>
<p>查沖繩島戰局作戰至今，爲時二月，敵人在本身之作戰上，猶未達到且的，不論在海上陸上均遭受慘重損害，尤其因路途遼遠，補給路綫之遙長，及國內之生產困難，更予以種種之不利。現在歐洲戰局吿一段落，敵企圖將歐洲戰綫之兵力移赴東亞作戰，終因歐洲政治上之諸項問題，如波蘭，奧地利，南斯拉夫各國之糾紛，以及歐洲居民食　恐慌問題，皆不能實現其理想中之作戰目的。同時敵人在歐洲久戰，已感精疲力竭，如移赴東亞，又因環境及地利之不同，是否能　揮戰力頗成間題，而在日本方面，則一貫木有之信念，決努力貫澈到底。</p>
<p>再敵方在大東亞之作戰上，擬仿歐洲戰塲之戰法作戰，誠如歐洲戰塲以航空兵力作爲主體，但在大東亞之作戰上截然不同，因大東亞戰爭之兵力乃在海上，敵敵人之盲目　動，是否能獲取所期待之成果，此點亦頗成問題。</p>
<h3>東亞同胞勿相殘殺</h3>
<p>此外，敵人最感嚴重者，為運輸之能力問題，運輸艦船之不足，在兵力補充上確屬困難重重，至作戰必要條件下，須在極短時期集中龐大兵力，在歐洲大陸上，英美尙可應付，惟在大東亞海上，共兵力集中，必感困難，即使英美今後將兵力移赴東亞，實爲日本予以各個擊破之良機。過去敵美在菲島作戰，運用二十萬兵力，已感力竭，如今在冲繩島原擬維持十萬兵力，亦以困難重重而未果，至今猶僅三四萬人。故今後如欲發動中國大陸作戰，必將利用中國人力作為主體，吾人均爲東亞同胞，決不能忍敵人以自己兵力殘殺自己。本人在此除第四十次海軍紀念日，　向前綫將士致敬外，決迎澈目標，本此決意，以克服困難。</p>
<p>最後吾人勿爲流言所誘惑，應集大東亞民族之強大團結，向摧毀　敵之途勇猛邁進」。</p>
<h3>蘇電台廣播　攻擊梵蒂岡</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　莫斯科電台昨夜廣播，攻擊梵蒂岡不應以「支撐德國天主敎爲其基本目標」，同時該電台復抨擊梵蒂岡之機關報不應公開反對於克里米亞會議中所決定之對德各項措　。</p>
<h3>呼應義列空挺隊　沖繩島日軍猛攻　周圍敵艦船續沉毀多艘</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　確保那　首里前面據點之日軍守備隊，爲呼應義烈空挺隊之猛攻，繼續奮戰，蓋敵軍由東海岸方面之與那原起，至距該地二十四公里處有若干南下，開抵該地東南方一公里之雨乞森及該地南方一公里之古堅及其西方一公里之與那　，日軍正在猛攻中。</p>
<p>南西基地二十六日中央社電　日航空部隊二十四日夜以來，連續猛攻冲繩周　之敵艦船機動部隊及本島敵飛行基地，迄今査盟戰果如下：北中機塲十餘處爆炸起火，擊沉大型艦二艘，巡洋艦一艘，大型輸送船一艘，擊燬中型輸送艦一艘。此外，於地上望見火柱十餘支，又報吿對於敵機動部隊正規空母等艦艇施行命中之突撞攻擊者，亦有數回，此種　列空挺隊之「敵中登陸」，與陸上守備部隊之奮戰相互策應，空陸一體之猛攻擊，愈演愈烈。</p>
<h3>蕪湖修築　各鄉堤壩</h3>
<p>蕪湖二十六日中央社電　本區各鄉圩堤，今歲由春及夏，延緩至今迄未修築，茲屆雨季，汜濫堪處，縣府方面乃派員前作各鄉視察，專責督導修築堤工，以防水患。</p>
<h3>葡萄牙屬領德資產不凍結</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據此間正式發表：在葡萄牙之德國資產予以凍結之通令，並未規定葡萄牙殖民地之德資產亦予凍結。</p>

<h3>日美海軍的決戰</h3>
<p>— 朱如松</p>
<p>正如過去日俄戰爭的勝負決於日本海海戰一　，在決定大東亞戰爭最後的成敗以前，太平洋上必先發生日美海軍的決戰。現在，海上決戰的時期已經逼近，在這個時候，我們欣逢日本第四十屆海軍節，回顧以往，足以測知未來。茲特將日本海軍的特點與這次決戰的前途，作一考察。</p>
<p>四十年前，日俄兩國的艦隊，在對馬海峽東方發生大戰，結果，日本東鄕元帥指揮下的聯合艦隊，以少勝多，獲得最後勝利。考其原因，不外乎下列數點；</p>
<p>日本之作戰，是爲抵抗帝俄的侵略，因此舉國上下，莫不同仇敵愾·團結一致。復以傳統的日本海軍精神，不問前方後方，都願爲國家獻身，士氣之激昂，達於極點。這稱精誠團結，盡忠報國的心理，就是日本戰勝俄國的精神上的基礎。</p>
<p>其時日本東鄕元帥，在日本近海的衝　要地點，設下十面埋伏陣，等待帝俄艦隊自投羅網。因俄國的波羅的海艦隊，遠涉重洋，疲憊不堪；而日本的聯合艦隊則養精蓄銳，以逸待勞，故能一鼓而殲淢敵軍，奠定了最後勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>日本海軍訓練的精良，統帥人才的優秀，戰術和戰略的優越，也是克敵致勝的重要因素。因此在日俄兩國　隊開火以後，不到到半小時，俄國艦隊就陣錢大亂，終於崩潰。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開始以來，日美兩軍的海上戰鬥，大小不下數十餘次。其間，日本海軍本其光榮的傳統精神，處處發揮　人的咸力，諸如夏威夷海戰，珊瑚海海戰，台灣海戰，菲島海職，冲繩海戰等，尤其在雷伊泰戰事展開以還，日軍的神風特攻隊發揮威力，與敵軍同歸於盡。這種殺身感仁的悲壯決心，我們在日俄戰爭中，日軍圍攻旅順的時候也可看到。目前，日美在太平洋上的作戰，更有幾點和日俄戰爭非常相似。</p>
<p>第一。日本這一次對英美作戰，一方面是爲了自存自衛，一方面是為了粉碎英美侵略東亞的野心，正義之師，戰意堅決。反之，英美是爲了侵略而戰，徒爲少數財閥的利益，而犧牲人命物資，敵人國內已經發生厭戰的情緖，而且英美與蘇聯之間的矛盾，目前已　成很微妙的形勢，所以英美對於眼前的時局，深感焦急煩燥。</p>
<p>第二，今日美軍因爲處於外綫作戰的地位，後方的連絡十分不便，必須橫渡浩瀚的太平洋，跋涉一萬公里的長途，方能到達最前錢。至於英軍的艦隊必須通過地中海和印度洋。因此，如何充分接濟前方作戰的軍隊，保持其攻擊力及機動力，在他們實在是一個極困難的問題。反之，日本的運　綫則很短，而且是在本國附近的海域作戰，顯然佔有地利人和的便宜，所以祗要時機來臨，即可一鼓作氣，予敵以致命打擊。</p>
<p>第三，近時的日本海軍，不但繼續保持　他們傳統的優越的精神，並且還在　極充實職力，　礪以須。迨本月一日復成立海軍總司令部，　任豐田大將爲第一任海軍總司令長官，使日本聯合艦隊及各鎭守府。警備府所轄部隊等全體海軍作戰部隊，完成了名副其査的一體化，因而更能適應近代作戰的複雜性。</p>
<p>最後，還有兩點値得我們注意：第一，在近代戰爭中，飛機已成主要兵器，有決定戰爭勝員的作用。而日本本部目前已不啻」大航空要塞，所以英美逼近日本時由於日軍航空部隊的猛攻，損失極大，例如沖繩島方面自三月二十三日至五月十日止，敵美已喪失艦艇五百十餘艘之多，今後其損害自必日增月大。第二，日本此次的作戰，不但全國一心一德，並且還得到東亞被侵略民族的協助，聲勢因此益壯。</p>
<p>今後的戰局無論怎樣發展，敵軍越接近日木，則敵方所受的打擊勢必愈趨嚴重，所付的代價將愈益重大，所過的困難也必愈多，而其深入的孤軍，甚至有全部覆滅的可能，這是值得注意的。</p>
<p>今天是日本第四十屈海軍節，我們除對盟邦海軍的光榮歷史表示無限敬意以外。並且深信在未來的海上大決戰中，盟軍定能建樹比過去更偉大的戰績，而使大東亞戰爭得到最後的勝利！</p>
<h3>艦橋指揮　日本海軍的光榮傳統</h3>
<p>「軍艦離基地後，已經過幾小時了？站在艦橋上的司令官，出神地這樣想。吃飯時間已經過了。據說，睡眠的時間很少，只是穿着軍服靠在椅子上。但並不像我這樣年青，雖然面孔晒得紅而黑，但已經相當老了。像我這樣人若站一兩個鐘頭，也會腿疼的，司令官還要站幾個鐘頭？不管敵人來與否，總是面對著空中遠望著敵蹤，並且看著海水，警戒著潛水艇的出沒。辦是　樣默默無言地　立著。甚至　望員都有輪流的鐘點。但司令官沒有來接班的人。並且為了不斷引導追　着的軍艦，決定方向和速度。這是如何勞苦功高呵！備當辛苦，站在最前綫上，像銅像般不動的司令官這種神氣，絕對負責任的這種精神，實在令人五體投地。」</p>
<p>這是從血腥的海洋戰場上最近回來的報導班員所說的話。　銅像般不動的司令官這樣神氣……就是面臨第四十屆海軍紀念日，凝視着烟火彌漫的太平洋，一億國民也必須都像司令官一樣，燃燒起滿腔同仇敵愾熱血來。戰史曾吿訴過我們，也曾敎訓過我們。</p>
<h3>令人感動的詩句</h3>
<p>「站在艦橋上的提督」，這是最令吾人感動的詩句。「勇敢的水兵歌」，「尙在人間的定遠號」等歌中的主人公三浦三等水兵陣亡的那次淸日甲午職爭，在黃海進行決戰時，完全擊潰丁汝昌北洋艦隊的伊東司令長官，也曾昌着槍林彈雨，嚴然不動地站在旗艦松島號的艦橋上。</p>
<p>在描　日本海戰「三笠號　橋圖」上的東鄕司令長官那種神色自若姿態，的確是表現着「島國興廢在此一舉」的神氣，的確是映現着「有國才有家」的神氣。還有佩帶着最光榮的受傷軍人徽章第一號，用雪白的手套包着左手三個指頭，緊緊把着軍刀的山本五十六元帥，以及有名的古賀　一元帥，一定也總是銅像般地站在艦橋上，這是每一個日本人都可以想像到的。</p>
<p>曾歌頌山本元帥「昌着烟火佇立　橋的我們日本提督」的山口司令官和加來艦長，全都站在艦橋上指揮，夜以繼日地度着太平洋上漫漫的長夜，和幕僚們靜悄悄地觀賞着淡淡的一輪明月，這種姿態，只有在聖職常中可以看到這種崇高的美麗。此外在起火燃燒的軍艦上，負著軍傷仍然在手旗台上作最後的指揮，像火　中的神仙一樣，漸漸消逝於海洋中的柳本柳少將臨死時，仍然是在「艦橋指揮」，實令吾人發生無限的崇拜。</p>
<h3>艦橋指揮之意義</h3>
<p>一個艦的艦長，一個艦隊的司令官，或整個全部艦隊的司令畏官，全都是站在最危險的軍艦的最前面。昭和十六年（一九四一年）春四月，因參加今後晋京的地方長官，在橫須賀軍港被邀請參觀某旗艦時，某一個縣知事曾發問說：</p>
<p>「司令長官老是在敵彈所描準的旗艦上，尤其是佇立在艦上最危險的艦橋上指揮，如從整個大局上設想，這是否是對的呢？」</p>
<p>山本提督很鎭靜地回答設：「這是甲午淸日戰爭時黃海大戰以來。　代長官所保守的海軍傳統」。</p>
<p>這位縣知事的問題，也決不是無理取鬧的。假如司令長官萬一有舛錯時，豈不影響全局麼？然而所謂「萬一有舛錯」，這是日本海軍所絕對遇不見的事情。在自己死以前，總是先擊斃敵人。這種艦橋指揮中所含有的熾烈鬥志，就是戰必勝，攻必克，我們日本海戰史上的光輝事跡。</p>
<h3>東鄉元帥的氣</h3>
<p>日本海戰的前夕，日本聯合艦隊的根據地移到內長山羣島，不久後在大　口第四十八號艇和宮古號軍艦相　觸雷沉沒，「吉野」號從旅順港外　歸根據地的途中，與春日號發生衝突而沉沒，另外還有戰鬥艦初瀨號和八鳥號，從事於封鎖旅順港的職鬥中，觸雷沉沒。一連串的不幸事件，尤其不幸者，六艘主力艦中失掉了初瀨和八島兩艘時，對於當時的海軍，實在可以說是很大的打擊。甚至當時的日本艦隊將士，有一點氣餒了。此時旗繼三笠號之後甲板上，有響亮的脚步聲。一看，原來是東鄉長官，在和藹的面孔上表現着微笑。日俄戰爭時，挽救日本海軍最大危機者，老實說，是站在艦橋上東鄕長官永久不改的笑顏。</p>
<p>昭和八年（一九三三年）有一天，松波仁一郞博士訪問東鄕元帥時說：「您年齡很高了（八十七歲），現在是否還能指揮大艦隊作戰？「元帥回答說：「腿不行了，昇降艦橋很困難」。松波博士又問元帥說：「讓別人扶到艦橋上去，您是否還能指揮作戰？」於是元帥的回答就有力了：「那可以一。一聽到這樣話的松波博士，立刻跑到海軍省，要求面見海軍大臣大角大將。他把東鄕元帥的話，一五一十地吿訴了海軍大臣。大角海相一聽到東鄕元帥能指揮聯合艦隊，便說謝謝！立刻召集海軍省的主要將校說：「我要吿訴諸位，方才松波博士和東鄕元帥的談話。最令人感激的是元帥這樣年老的人，還能指揮大艦隊作戰」。聽者都大爲感動，立刻又向各艦隊發出通告。</p>
<p>八十七歲還能在艦橋上指揮作戰的英勇氣慨，三十九年前日本海戰時曾用這一氣慨戰勝過敵人，一戰而　定了日本萬世不動的國基，現在日本海上的猛將如雲，將鎭平太平洋的怒濤。</p>
<h3>永遠在戰鬥之中</h3>
<p>從軍杜拉基夜襲大捷的報道班員，會寫過下列事實。</p>
<p>夜襲作風和演習並看不出有什麼不同。艦橋總是靜靜的，「各就本位」的每日千篇一律訓練。在任何地方看不出有興奮的情形，眨瞬間，就耍發生天翻地覆的大決戰了，然而兵士的心海上並未起任何波濤。都像艦橋是鋼鐵作的一樣，鴉雀無聲，這是我永生不能忘記的夜海戰。水兵一心一意地揩洗甲板。姿態與平日毫無不同。最感激者，　後仍然照常進行自己的日常功課，這一點深深印在我的心板上。</p>
<p>東鄉元帥在日本海戰得勝後，在回佐世保的歸途上，命令部下說：「進行戰鬥訓練吧！」山本元帥所說的「常在戰塲」，古賀元帥所說的「不斷戰鬥」等意義，也都由這位報道班員第一次明顯地記下來了。　著阿拉伯吹來的熏風，遠渡著波濤大作的印度洋，正如「擊沉」電影所示，大東亞戰爭開始所收獲到的無數戰果，都廳當歸功於指揮官所立的「艦橋作戰」上。（譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>近代戰爭中的空挺隊</h3>
<p>— 俊民</p>
<p>日本大本營五月二十五日下午四時三十分發表，陸軍特別攻繫隊義烈空挺隊，二十四日利用月夜，於冲繩本島北·中兩機塲强行降陸，炸毀敵美軍　倉庫　及戰場設施等。同時，日本特別攻擊飛行隊也從旁策應，對冲繩島周圍的敵美艦船猛烈攻擊。對於全軍皆化為特攻隊而殉國的日軍，所建戰助如何，本不在意。這次所得的戰果，詳情雖未立即發表，但據日大本營的公報稱，前者已使敵軍陷入大混亂中，汕後者則正　續攻擊，於此可見其意義的深長了。在不久的將來，其詳細情形當可由日本大本營的發表而公之於世。至其影響，行將表現於以沖繩島爲中心的日美決戰上。日軍特攻隊的猛攻，實爲累積大東亞戰爭勝利因素的戰法，値得我們注意。</p>
<h3>空挺隊的真相</h3>
<p>空挺隊，正如其名所示，係用可乘二十人至五十人的大型旅客機運往敵軍要地上空，用降落傘挺身降陸的部隊。有時，則用滑翔機戰運，每二·三架滑翔機用一大型飛機曳航，飛括敵方要地上空時，使之各別脫離，而集團降陸。單由以上所述情形而觀，似與空輸步兵隊並無二致，惟其武器與步兵等所用者異，是小型而又非常精巧的。大多數的空挺隊員，除有極其　良的小型機關槍外，並携有小　砲。而在大規模的空挺作戰中，並用滑翔機運輸戰車，摩托車等，所以降陸以後的機動性與戰鬥力是很大的，其攻擊的兇猛有力，決非單純的步兵可比，加之未降陸以前，先由空中或地面實行充分的偵察，選定敵軍防禦力　薄弱或最易進攻的塲所降下，所以和地上部隊進　相異，可以極度限制敵軍叢揮其戰鬥力，突然從天而降，當敵軍倉皇不知所揩之時，更憑其高度的機動力，展開先制攻擊，在敵軍能够集中兵力以前，加以各個擊破，樹立莫大的戰果。</p>
<p>這次義烈空挺隊的作戰，大抵一部分降落於飛行塲附近的山林中，襲擊敵軍的物資與飛機格納庫，另一部分則降陸於飛行塲中央，在敵軍防備飛行場的重火器未及開火時，即中止其活動力，所以降陸以後能够成功，將其各種軍事設施炸毀，並焚毀其停在地上的飛機。</p>
<h3>近代航空戰的真相</h3>
<p>飛機爲今日戰爭的主要兵器，這已是無可否認的事實。日本陸海軍在大東亞戰爭中獲得空前的大戰果，其原動力就在於航空部隊的精强，而德國在歐洲失敗的主要原因，則可　諸空軍的劣勢，由此可知決定現代戰爭的勝負者，實爲航空兵力的消長。</p>
<p>此　敵方當然也知道，　於對德空　獲得意外的大效果，他們竟誇　準備將這同樣的戰法應用於太平洋戰爭。其實歐洲與太平洋的形勢全然不同，所以英美一定很難如願以償，不過，敵方在歐洲方面所用的戰法，總有加以檢討的必要，尤其在歐戰已經吿一段落的今日，預料最先轉用於東亞戰塲的，將是航空兵力。茲以美國爲中心，一窺歐戰中航空戰鬥的情形。</p>
<h3>日軍空挺隊的特異性</h3>
<p>日本空挺隊最異於一般的特質，就是具有不期生還的神風特攻精神。</p>
<p>遠離友軍戰綫而降落於敵軍陣地的空挺隊，當然不畏死，這是任何國的空挺隊員都是一樣的，日本的空挺隊員當然是更加不怕死了。他們具有不惜以死貫澈任務的所謂神兵精神。不過，犧牲生命並不是目的，而是完成任務的手段。不顧生死的人拼命奮戰時，其成就當然是盡人力之最善的最高結果。在冲繩本島美軍佔領下的北·中飛行塲降陸後，直到全體奮勇戰死時止，義烈空挺隊將盡力炸毀敵機，破壞其設施，殺傷其人員，必將使用所携的彈藥，獲得最大的戰果。因此，他們的戰績將是空前　赫的，給與敵軍的損害，不　限於物質和人員，就是在心理上，相信也是很大的。</p>
<h3>歐戰的教訓　敵空軍的數量</h3>
<p>英美軍對德有組織的空襲，從去年二月左右起，纔很顯著。同年初，敵方在歐洲的航空兵力，爲美機五千七百架，英機八千四百架，合計一萬四千一百架．迨在法國北部登陸時，美機增至一萬架，英機則爲八千九百架，合計－萬八千九百架（僅集結英國本部的航空兵力，合計亦達一萬一千架），而德方則僅九千餘架。在　衆　懸殊的絕對優勢下，英美的侵歐作戰乃得有利的展開。即英美空軍對法國北部及德國西南的德軍陣地·鐵路·工廠·飛機場·大都市等，施行猛烈的轟炸，削弱德軍的　動　，這樣戰鬥了半年，乃得突入德國本部。</p>
<p>在德法國境附近的戰鬥，英美空軍屢用千架左右的轟炸機大編隊實行一種「絨　轟炸」，一齊投下多量炸彈，摧毀了目的地的一切。本年以來，對德轟炸更加劇烈。在三月英美軍渡過萊茵河前後，據說一天是出動三千架以上的飛機。</p>
<h3>敵空軍的素質</h3>
<p>對德轟炸所用的飛機，美機爲B17（空中堡　），B24（解放者），英機最近則用　卡斯泰，均　四引擎的　轟炸機。其中B17，B24　也　次出現於大東亞戰塲，而成爲日本空軍攻擊的對手。</p>
<p>所用炸彈，歐戰初期爲半噸左右者，至去年年底，英國　卡斯泰機就開始使用亞斯克埃克六噸炸彈，等到渡萊因河前後，更用伏爾卡　十一　炸彈，轟炸交通設施及其他戰略要點。關卡斯泰重轟炸機的裝載力，在今日好像是最大的了。</p>
<p>另一方面，重　鬥機亦裝載小型炸彈，以高速度施行轟炸。美軍P38的編隊且時時攻擊德軍地上部隊。</p>
<p>至於投擲炸彈的方式，也不單由重力作用而任其自然下落，並用火箭式炸彈，以期在重力作用之外再加上人為的推進力，藉此增加炸彈的效力，發揮更大的效果。據說炸毀歐洲沿岸德國潛水艇格納庫厚壁的，就是這種火箭式炸彈。這樣火箭原理的應用範圍就有日趨廣泛的傾向。爲了對抗德國梅　修密脫　進戰鬥機起見，據敵方發表，美國則在試造西可丁斯泰式　進機，英國亦有特哈維關2等　進機，唯在歐戰中此種高速機尙未實際應用。</p>
<h3>敵方航空戰略</h3>
<p>飛機運用於軍事上的初期，一般的航空戰略思想，就是在戰爭開始時即用大規模的航空兵力一舉打　敵國心險部，以期迅速結束戰爭。前次大戰時　大利杜埃將軍所提倡的戰略理喻便是　　的。然而這是理想的塲合，在實際戰爭中，因爲敵國也有强力的空軍，所以先須　開空軍決戰，打敗對方，取得制空　，然後纔能轟炸敵國的中　，此種　想的代表者，就是英國的格洛伐因將軍。因此，英國空　對於充實空中決戰有力要素的戰鬥機隊，頗爲致力。所以在法國　　以後能够對付德國空軍的轟炸英國本部；而英軍在北非決戰所以能够取勝，也得力於此點。美國空軍亦採用這種戰略，自從去年一月以來，在世界各地依據英國一流的空軍戰略，確立了聯合空軍組織，即分航空部隊為戰術航空部隊及戰略航空部隊。戰術空軍致力於摧毀敵方航空兵力，以及協助地上作戰等，專對敵國現有兵力加以攻擊。而戰略空軍，則對敵軍後方交通設施，軍需工廠，大都市等戰時要點，即潛在戰力，致力攻擊。換言之，前者在於打擊敵方現有兵力，後者則在威脅爲現有兵力源泉的潛在戰力，兩者相扶相携，以圖消耗對手的戰力</p>
<p>現在　一個戰略轟炸效果的例子，據敵美石油管理局次長拉爾福。凱·台維斯五月六日在華盛頓宜稱，去歲一年之中，英美空革對於德方精油廠及其他石油製造設施，前後空襲二百七十次，投下近乎十萬噸的炸彈，使德軍發生燃料不足。其戰車及航空兵力因而大受打擊。</p>
<h3>日本的命運</h3>
<p>據敵方的宣傳，敵美英對德戰爭結束後，用於歐洲戰塲上的物力人力，已可移用於東亞了。這不是單純的宣傳，而爲實際的問題，自屬意料之事。尤其是最易移動的飛機及航空人員的一部分，在數星期內即可出動於東亞戰塲，此由敵軍現在的損失而觀，不難預料。</p>
<p>最近，據某軍事專家的論文稱，由於船舶及移動距　的關係，敵美英軍得運至東亞戰塲的兵力，到明年四·五月間，約爲倍於現有兵力的二百萬。這不過是可以調至東亞的兵力，至於具有充分戰鬥力的軍隊，則因船舶和　　關係，軍需物資的運輸殊多　　，左右不過五十萬人耳。以此爲基本，要想展開日本本土上陸作戰固毋論，即欲實行中國沿海登陸作戰，亦未必能像敵方宣傳那樣簡單。然而，憑此一點而即斷定日本必勝，未免失之過早。蓋敵美英將抽調其用於歐洲戰略轟炸的多數B24等類中型轟炸　到東亞戰塲來，以硫黃島·冲繩島一類接近日本本土的鳥　爲甚地，加緊實行航空作戰，對日本都市作玉石不分的轟炸，以謀削弱日本的軍需生產力，使其不能抗戰。此外，敵美並採用使日本本土陷於孤立的戰略，派飛機投下機雷，妨礙日本海上運輸。然而，在日本，確保本土附近的島嶼及中國大陸，則為最重要的取勝因素。</p>
<p>要想確保宜於建立航空基地的陸地全部，範圍旣甚廣大，實現當然不易。而况即使能够佔領，並在那裏集積軍需資材，由於空挺隊的活躍，隨時可用飛機在敵軍要地降陸，所以奪回或破壞它的可能性很大。這次日軍義列空　隊的驚人壯舉，在這意義下，實在是可以左右東亞戰局的，其戰果與影響，　堪重視。</p>
<h3>日本海軍總司令部</h3>
<p>在冲繩島的戰爭，愈演愈烈，終於面臨最後決戰的階段，因而海軍爲適　戰局．而大興改革、即決定成立海軍總司令部。海軍作戰部隊的兵力，擁有上兵力，航空兵力，特攻兵力，隊戰　備兵力等極其　綜複雜的組織，但成立海軍總司令部的意義。在於全部海軍兵力的一元化，及其右效地統　，担任聯合艦隊下的各艦隊，海上　南，鎮守府，警備府所屬各部隊和各　　，海軍領導下之主要作戰部隊　之　一指揮。過去聯合艦　隊司令長官，事實上固然也担任這種統一的指揮，但目前是成為固定的制度，自然這是有其絕大意　的。</p>
<p>聯合艦隊自從中日甲午戰爭和日俄戰爭以來，業巳成爲固定的形式。海軍兵力固然只限於海上部隊，但此次大東亞戰爭榮已改變了海洋作戰的形相，而變爲航空作戰了。因而，聯合艦隊也終於改變了原來的形相，而握有艦隊航空兵力和基地航空兵力。現在，航空兵力已經成爲海洋作戰的主要兵力了。因此，構成海軍兵力的成分，業已五花八鬥了。</p>
<p>同時，戰塲已移近日本本土，隸屬於鎮守府及　備府的基地和部隊等，都已經成爲最前綫上的兵力，而參加　敵作戰了。這爲了適應各種情形，當然有必要對海軍全部兵力實行有效的統一指揮。由於海軍總司令部的成立，可以看出來海軍在等待總司令長　的果斷用兵方法，而　滅及捕捉敵人在海上勢力的決心。</p>
<p>特別應當指出者，即在　個海軍方面德高望重的豐田大將，兼第一任長官，所以全體兵士的情緒，愈爲激昂，因而我們敢斷　，由於　種必勝士氣，定會取得勝利的結果。（譯自五月三日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>太平洋敵航空兵力</h3>
<p>航空兵力在大東亞戰爭中的機能，屢經論列，幾已說無可說了。日本海軍的銳鋒，以海軍航空部隊爲先鋒，到處展開了敵軍海上兵力的擊滅戰。敵方跳島反攻作戰的主軸，就是航空兵力。環繞日本本土的日美決戰，最初當然是在航空決戰的形式下進行的。敵方宣稱將用對付德國的那種　法來攻擊日本本土，果然能够嗎？日來檢討一番。</p>
<h3>基地的問題</h3>
<p>英美軍　入歐洲時，曾有英倫三島作其立足點。像英國本部一樣接近歐洲大陸，而且可以容納　大兵力的基地，今日英美軍在日本土周　尙未能够找到。現在，他們只有使用B29的馬里亞納基地，單靠這個，到底不能實行有效的大攻擊。因此，美軍不得不窺伺冲繩島，企　取得該基地，以便大卅驅使用於歐洲方面的B17，B24等中型轟炸機。</p>
<h3>補給的問題</h3>
<p>到馬里亞納基地爲止，基補給就非克服從美國本部起幾達一萬公里的距離不可。補給綫的　長，對於作戰能率自有極其不利的影響。</p>
<h3>機種的問題</h3>
<p>如果用於歐洲方面的機種不能迅即見效於對日戰，那末他們只有依仗B29了。這種大型機。據美方發表，月產不過二百架左右，以此能否展開積極攻勢，不無疑問。况且，其空襲縱有效果，面其損害率也是極大的。</p>
<h3>戰略的問題</h3>
<p>敵方一面用馬里亞納基地的B29實行戰略轟炸，一面用航空　　的空軍摧毀方現有兵力，即由抗空母艦的空軍負起了歐戰中戰術航空部隊的任務。這在統率上有很大的難處，而且還有遭遇莫大消耗的危險。</p>
<h3>航空戰略態勢</h3>
<p>企圖以航空作戰迫近日本本土的敵軍，其困難的衆多，已如上述。但敵軍的立塲，使其不得不　　種種危險。而進行作　。對於這樣的局面，日方的　擊戰已如何呢？我們知逍，對於　方的不利，也就是對於日本的有利點。茲列舉如下：</p>
<p>第一，日本本土就是雄大的航空基地羣。今日，在日本本部每一個地方每一個角落，都用航空基地鞏固起來，已完全化爲航空要塞了。</p>
<p>第二，日軍的補給自由自在。由於軍需工業的分散配置，日本本土各部均能自戰自存，况且在其背後尙有滿洲和中國的　大預備資源。</p>
<p>第三，因爲採取誘敵深入的戰法，所以不必像敵方一樣生產多量的大型飛機，而可用小型機來收獲最大的效果。而日本軍需工業技術又極優秀，能够製造遠非敵軍炸彈等可比擬的良好炸彈魚雷，建下偉大的戰果。敵軍的大型炸彈等，是絲毫不足恐　的。</p>
<p>第四，以上述的戰略要素爲背景，日軍的航空　法運用自如，而日軍的意氣又復　揚，對於接近的敵軍，必殺得他們片甲不留。日軍的特攻隊就是這稱戰法的　華．至其　力，敵美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資四月視察冲繩島時，曾誇獎日本說：「如果　特攻隊飛入，最後必遭非常的損害！」</p>
<p>從上述各點看來，敵方　用歐洲方面的兵力於太平洋戰塲，也不足懼的。即使他們能够抽　剩餘的一萬架飛機，但在消耗　快的航空作戰中，也不能期待有什麼效果。對於日本必勝的航空戰略勢態，能夠投下一抹暗影的，只有敵方　略轟炸的破壞日本潛在勢力。不過，日本國民現在正發揮其　　值，在空襲下猛然充實戰力，將來攻的敵軍打沉到太平洋的洋底。當敵方人力物力消耗淨盡的時候，戰勝的良機自然來了。</p>
<h3>煇煌的戰績一年來的日本海軍</h3>
<p>一年來，大東亞戰爭的發展驚人，日海軍在沉　作戰中，以特攻隊爲骨幹，每予來襲敵美機動部隊以極大創傷，其中最為有名的，凡經歷：　馬里亞納　島海戰，　培里琉島海戰，　台灣大海空　，　菲島東海面大海空戰</p>
<p>林加因灣大海戰，　琉黃島大海戰，　九州東南海而及冲繩島附近大海</p>
<p>這七次大的戰役，是其　犖大者，每次戰役日海空軍均配合島上陸軍作壯烈拼　戰術，特攻隊的犧牲精神，以一機換一　口號，使敵機動部隊每次都遭受莫大損害。尼米資　下之第三　隊第五號隊，被粉碎得七零八落，補足也來不及</p>
<p>茲就一年來之數次大戰役，分　各役戰鬥經過詳情如次：</p>
<p>一　馬里亞納海戰　去年六月廿日：日大本營發表　來襲塞班島之敵軍於六月十五日下午奪取該島之一角後，即逐次增强兵力，日守備部隊常即邀擊，已予以重創。　出現於馬利亞納羣島附近之敵，乃以航空母艦及戰艦爲主幹之大機動部隊，敵方現已將太平洋方面　隊之大部集中於該方面，日航空部除正連日攻繫敵機動部隊中。　自六月十二日迄二十日，日所獲戰果如次：甲·擊沉敵戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦一艘，潛水艦一艘。乙。炸毀敵航空母艦四艘以上，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦四艘，遝輪船八艘，及艦型未詳者一艘。丙。擊落敵機三百餘架。</p>
<p>去年六月廿四日，日前海相末次信正大將特就馬利亞納海戰勝利，發表談話，謂吾國國民絕不能袖手旁觀，日　除將恃　秀航空兵力，對來挑戰之敵艦予以重大打擊云云。</p>
<p>七月一日，馬利亞納海戰之後，敵機動部隊進　至小笠原　島及硫黃島，日軍與之作戰，收獲戰果如次：　日　隊於六月廿四日，在小笠原羣島南方，炸沉敵航空母艦二艘，艦型不　者二艘，擊落敵機五十五架以上。　在塞班島及附近海面，自六月　日到　日，收獲戰果如次：炸沉敵戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘，運輸船二艘，炸毀航空母艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘，運輪船五艘，擊落敵機二百十一架。</p>
<h3>二　培里琉島海戰</h3>
<p>七月十七日，日海軍大臣島田　太郎辭職，由海軍大將正田位動一等功三級野村直邦繼任。</p>
<p>從馬利亞納海戰以後是帛　　　的　戰，之前有大　島及　尼安　島的　　。</p>
<p>七年廿六日：日大本　發表　敵　於七月廿三日於迭尼安島登陸，　廿四日、敵軍於大宮島登陸，均遭日守軍　　邀擊。以上兩島的作戰均經歷二個月的爭　，日軍始終未停止抵抗．</p>
<p>九月廿二日，戰爭在帛琉及雅浦兩島間展開，一日擊落敵機逾百架，同時培里琉島上亦有激戰。</p>
<p>十月六日，日大本營發表帛琉　島戰果如次，　自九月十五日敵　登陸培里琉琉島以來，敵將兵傷亡一萬八千餘名，戰車中彈起火以及擱淺者爲九十餘　，　獲破壞其大砲十三門，擊沉巡艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，潛永艇一艘，掃海艇一艘，艦種不明者一艘，擊毀潛水艇一艘，掃海艇一艘，艦種不詳者二親，登陸用艇六十二艘等。</p>
<h3>三　台灣大海空戰</h3>
<p>帛琉羣島之作戰未已，至十月中旬有台灣之大空戰，繼着大東亞戰爭以來最　烈之海空戰，在菲島四局展開。</p>
<p>十月十二日，有優勢敵機來襲台灣，迄下午三時許，計擊落敵機約百架，同時日航空部隊十二日夜於台灣東方海面攻擊敵機動部隊，歷夜半之反覆攻擊，計擊沉航空母艦一艘，檻型不詳者一艘，擊毀航空母艦一艘，艦型不詳者一艘。</p>
<p>十月十大日，台灣海而之敵　　部隊全部潰走，日軍之大戰果　毀滅敵艦四十餘艘。計：擊沉航空母　十艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋　三艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊毀航空母艦三艘，戰艦一艘．巡洋艦四艘　型不詳者十一艘。</p>
<p>台灣東海面大海空戰，是菲島大海戰的先　。</p>
<h3>四　菲島海面海戰</h3>
<p>菲島附近海空大戰自十月十五日開始，至廿五日，日大本營發表戰果有如下述：繫沉航空母　四艘，巡艦三艘，驅逐艦一艘，運輸船四艘以上，擊毀航空母艦二艘，戰　一艘，巡洋艦二艘。</p>
<p>敵美軍則於十月廿二日乘天時變化，於菲島東甫角之雷伊泰島登陸，並以艦艇侵入雷伊　　，因此大東亞戰爭中之最大　滅戰，遂在此灣內連續　開，日特攻隊屢次出動，均予敵艦極大創傷。</p>
<p>十月廿八日，日大太營發表兩個戰報，分別說明在雷伊泰及菲東海面之偉大戰果，而如與前在台　東海面之戰果合併計算，計有如下之赫赫戰果。</p>
<p>擊沉：航空母艦十九艘，戰艦二艘，巡艦六艘，驅逐艦三艘，輸送艦四艘。</p>
<p>擊毀：航空母艦十五艘，戰艦三艘，巡艦六艘，驅逐艦四艘，輸送艦四艘，艦型不詳者十二艘。共計擊沉毀之敵艦達七十二艘。</p>
<p>同時在雷伊泰灣內，另被零星擊沉毀之敵登陸用艦及小艦船等，達百零八艘。</p>
<p>此後日　　特別攻擊隊又先後於十月二十五日出動，對敵在菲東海面之艦隊攻擊，二十五日至三十日之間，　滅敵艦三十五艘。擊落敵機五百架。十一月一日　風隊再對雷伊泰　之敵艦攻擊，一舉炸毀沉敵戰艦等十艘。</p>
<p>故太平洋　的波濤汹湧，已使敵美艦隊聞日神風隊之威名而　慄。其損　至十一月二日前擊沉敵艦船達八十八艘，擊毀達百二十一艘，計共達二百零九艘之多。</p>
<p>十一月八日，日陸海軍分別發表菲島方面指揮官，陸軍方面山下　文大將爲陸軍最高指揮官，　永恭次中將爲陸軍航空部隊指揮官，海軍方面最高指揮官為大川內傳七大將，海軍航空部隊指揮官則為福留　中將及大西瀧次部中將。</p>
<p>十一月十日，上海日軍在勤海軍武官長近藤中將於七日奉命轉任軍令部，後任者湊　讓少將，在十日正式視事就職並發表談話。</p>
<p>菲島戰事，始終在極度緊張中進展，其中日特攻隊對敵雷　之艦船　予轟炸，在民答　　及呂宋東西海面，均有大戰。陸上敵軍在雷伊塞島上與日軍奮戰，亦陷於相待者凡達二個多月。至十二月十六日，敵艦船在　過菲島南端，進入菲島西方海面，於明多羅島登陸，但仍給予日損折敵實力之機會。在十二月十三日至十五日兩天中，即沉毀敵艦二十五艘，在十二月二十日至二十三日問沉毀二十二艘。雷伊泰灣，奧爾莫克　，明多　　，均成爲敵人之死　。</p>
<p>風特攻隊又於十二月二十八日至二十九日，在民　峨島海面，擊滅敵艦十七艘，本年一月三日亦炸沉毀敵艦五艘。</p>
<p>當是時，敵對菲島之作戰，乃又由雷伊泰島明多羅島進入對呂宋島本格之戰。是爲菲島決戰之重心所在矣。</p>
<h3>五　林加因大海戰</h3>
<p>今年一月三日至五日，敵機先有空襲台灣及冲繩之舉，在損失二十五架後逃竄。</p>
<p>一月七日，敵艦隊出現於呂宋島之林加因灣外，又於馬尼拉灣外徘徊，經日航空部隊之攻擊，被擊沉達三十餘艘，而敵在呂宋林加因　之登陸作戰，則於一月九日冒險進行。自後，林加因　即成為第二雷伊泰　，每日有敵艦船被炸沉歿。至一月十二日止，敵艦船之損失已達百二十一艘。</p>
<p>而林加因灣登陸之敵軍，一直在狹小陣地內，至二十日已損害六千名以上。尙未能有進展。至二月二日，日大本營之發表，林　登陸敵軍已傷亡一萬一千二百名。而另一部敵艦船於一月二十九日　入馬尼拉灣，遭受猛烈打擊。</p>
<p>菲律賓作戰至二月中旬，卒以敵軍之優勢壓迫，日守軍改採消耗戰略，由馬尼拉市撤退，山下大將以馬市東北方山地爲據點，繼續作戰，迄今猶未停止。而　　展開者爲硫黃島之戰。</p>
<h3>六硫黃島大海戰</h3>
<p>二月十七日，日大本營發表，敵軍於砲轟下企圖於硫黃島登陸，但　次均遭日守軍擊退，同時日航空部隊於硫島四周　敵猛攻，炸沉敵艦八艘，是爲硫黃戰役之開始。</p>
<p>二月十九日。敵於硫黃島開始登陸，這一幕壯烈的戰爭延長三十餘日，在激戰之時日。神風特攻隊亦出動助戰，自十六日至二十二日，即擊沉毀敵艦船僅以大本營發表者即達二十九艘，至二月底更增至五十餘艘。同時島上登陸敵軍之損害，至二月底已達一萬三千五百名，至三月七日已累計二萬餘名，硫黃島凡計九言哩之面積，而敵軍必需付如此代價，要亦顯出日守軍忠勇犧牲精神。至三月十六日，硫黃島日軍宣吿壯烈殉國，而敵軍死傷計約二萬五千八百人之多。硫島日軍指揮官栗林中將之英名，永垂千古。</p>
<h3>七　九州東南及沖繩之戰</h3>
<p>硫島之後，遂進入最近之冲繩島決戰，在三月十八日至二十三日，敵先以機動部隊出現於九州東南海面，企岡擾亂日軍之防衛，日軍在防衛本土之重任下，予以迎頭痛擊，於五日內擊沉敵正規航空母艦五艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦五艘，其他一艘，敵機動部隊遂狼狽南　。</p>
<p>至三月二十五日，敵機動部隊出現於冲繩島海　，並於一部份兵力在　良開列　登陸。於是遂展開迄今的琉球羣　之戰。　二十六日至二十九日三天中，冲繩方面敵艦船即被沉毀三十艘！至四月二日，在冲繩海面沉失之敵艦達百七十七艘，嗣後於四月八日，日大本營又迫加擊沉毀敵艦四十八艘之公報，則敵之損害，更為嚴重矣。至十六日之綜合戰果，則在冲繩周邊之敵　船之損害已達三九三艘，若增加近一月來之戰果，敵船在冲繩附近沉毀者，至少在四百艘以上矣。</p>
<p>迄今冲繩島猶在日軍堅守中，敵軍愈進入日防綫之腹心，則其損害愈大，是可斷言。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總觀一年來的戰局展開，已使敵輪船之損失　千餘艘，死傷人員達十萬名以上。日軍在確立必勝　　，日前在保衛本土的　大任務下，日海軍正以其精銳力量，組織決戰　隊。在日大本營元帥，新首相鈴木海海軍大將軍及海相米內大將的指導下，充分準備以赴。</p>
<p>五月一日帝國海軍爲應付近代戰，特設立海軍總司令部，特任豐田副武上將爲第一任海軍總司令。</p>
<p>相信日海軍陣容，更爲鞏固，全軍由豐田上將之領導，俱抱誓死減敵之決心，爲爭　大東亞戰爭之最後勝而　鬥也。</p>
<p>當茲第四十屆日本海軍節，吾人回顧年來之戰爭演化，對盟邦之强勁海軍，有不勝期望焉。</p>
<h3>日神奈川縣海軍被服廠　後方戰塲素描</h3>
<p>現在有句話，即「後方亦爲戰場」，只要看看神奈用縣海軍被服廠就可以曉得，的確是「戰塲」。她們女工拿出全副精神來，甚至一針也要多作，一件也要多送到前綫上去給戰士們穿。以前在經營工塲方面和生產方面，都曾與世界爭衛的某紡織公司老板，看到這種情形也驚歎不已，認爲自已過去二十多年所作的，從未有過如此的勞動熱忱。在這樣後方戰塲上，不斷爭取到赫赫戰果者，多半都是二十歲不到的靑年女郞。甚至飛機工塲，七八成的戰工，也全是女人。被服　這完全是「女工廠」。</p>
<p>裁剪廠－折　著五十張布，上面放著樣本，用電剪裁。在三十六公尺長的台子上不斷　裁的，恐怕全國只有這一處。十五六歲的小女孩子，手扯着一端，跑到台子一旁，而女技術工一拉布　就整齊地落到合子上。女孩子來回總是跑步。一天要跑一百六十次，來回等於三百二十次，這是如何辛苦的工作呵！</p>
<p>衣料間裏，充滿着無數淺綠色的布匹。一件一地向裁　室抬。排列成數行的數百架　　，從上午八時開工，至下午五時半歇工，其間上午與下午各有二十分鐘的休息時間，正午有四十分鐘的午　　間，此外則全是百分之百的工作時間了。在每一個柱子上掛著一　花，這織可以分別出是「女工廠」來。另外有琳郎滿目的標語口號。例如「認真工作！」等。熱誠工作情形，　外人　來，似乎是瘋狂的樣子，在普通工塲裏，班長只是一個　　員，在這一工塲裏，不過是工作中的一份了，一遇到材料　晚了，則有申斥　傳來，說「班長，快快！」十五六歲的少女，使用着似乎手拿不動的熨斗，敏捷地工作着。就是壯年男人　續三十分鐘這樣工作，一定也會疲倦的。</p>
<p>身體比較軟弱的人，就在軍帽製造間担任工作，但也此普通工塲多生產四倍。每一個女工心中，總想爲前綫上的戰士，多縫一針，多作一件，由於這種勞動熱忱，所以工作完成得多時，就心花怒放，高興萬分。有時候，興奮得晚上睡不着。按工塲的到班率說，實際業已達到「百分之九十八點九十三」，曠工者爲百分之一點零七，這一數目也全是因病未上工者。</p>
<p>香雲寮，紫蘭寮，就是地們寄宿的寢室名。她們的寄宿舍，完全是海軍式，就好像海軍學生的居室一樣。在寄宿舍的黑板上，寫着很大的座右銘：「無論有多大學問，如無賢無勇則不成，吾儕之生活，即一勇字」。「鐸目五月二十三日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>攻潛學校訪問記</h3>
<p>「近代戰」可以稱作十足的「補充戰」。飛機的增加生產愈大，則保護資源地與本土問航路的海防艦，驅潛艇，以及遝輸船　　艦的責任亦愈大。敵人潛水艇努力破壞這一交通錢，自然這也是意中事。在這種激烈的補充戰上，預備學生畢業的士官，現在用雙肩擔負著全國的期待，而在戰鬥着。記者曾訪問攻潛學校，並且曾看見準備獻身於這種激烈補充戰而默默無言不斷訓練中的預備學生，紀者熱烈希望預備學生將在「補充戰海」上有無限的建樹。</p>
<p>「攻潛學校」，過去在機　學校時代業已被人所敬仰了。這個學校用音波兵器和水測兵器以求敵方潸水艇。艦艇放射　雷，飛機從傍加以協助，這樣由空中海上攻擊潛水艇的戰爭，改變了過去的內容。一九四四年改名爲「攻潛學校」，一切都重新加以調整，一切都服從國家的要求。</p>
<p>該校畢業的預備學生，業已在攻潛戰爭的最前錢上活躍著了。然而時局一天比一天地緊急，自然還希望一般學生的參加。現在時局在耍求學生，立刻到前綫上去。在要求學校的學生和前綫上的戰士並肩作戰。這是紀者深深的一個感覺。</p>
<p>由第一錢回來成爲母校敎官的某中尉（東京帝大畢業），聰到他的言語，實令人感動萬分。操勝負　的補充戰，比以前任何時候都更要求獻身於海防戰，驅潛艇，及其他攻滯戰上再接再厲的路決精神。對於中堅幹部，都在要求早日學成，這是需要看學生奮勉程度如何而定。預備學生訓練期間的前一半主要是航海，砲術，通信，航空等科學，短艇陸戰·劍鎗術等的訓練；後一半則主要爲術科，如水中測定，航海術，攻潛作戰，海上護衛等，重心是在於情通攻潛作戰靈魂之水深判斷和爆　戰。和學生一同生活的大半敎官，都是以前畢業的預備學生。</p>
<p>這批育年十官，全都是前此在槍林彈雨中鑽來鑽去而現在圓來了的戰士。六時起床後向天　遙拜，晟課（體操，跑步，自習一小時），上午三小時課程，午飯，下午三小時課程。在校學生就是如此訓練著。當時我曾船聽中尉（兩館高等水　畢業）過去作戰的經過。</p>
<p>S中尉乘的海防潛，保護著　輸船，向╳╳地一直前進。經過數　夜的航行後，運輸船　　目地了。當時，有兩條雪白的水雷踪影，一直向運輸船衝來。太陽還很高，這是輕視日本海防艦，而進行的白畫攻繫戰。此時S中尉怒氣不可遏，說了一聲「他媽的！」於是海防艦就順着水雷踪跡，開足馬力尋找敵人去了。一轉身，就用最大的速度向前追趕敵人，並發射爆雷。一剎那間，海面上立刻漂浮出來重油的波紋。真是飛蛾投火。自來送死！S中尉心裏覺得非常愉快</p>
<p>聽到這樣老前輩的功勞時，學生們在鍛練體格上，學科上，都愈加密勉了。還有聽到攻擊潛艇時被犧牲的老前輩，學生們便對英靈流着熱淚，發誓復仇。</p>
<p>「我們保護着遝轍船隊，平安完成任務，到達海港時，就有無數的同學來迎。立刻稍加寒喧後，便開始談各自的戰鬥經過了，此時可以說是最痛快的時候。然而有時候，在海港上看不到戰友的面孔。那時候，我們就</p>
<h3>海軍機關學校</h3>
<p>當走進學生館時，在它三層樓窗與窗之間的那面大鐘，正是十一點五十分。白色制服的學生，正在跑著步。載戰鬥帽的「一號生」，不時高　叱責載軍帽的一二號生」，「三號生」，不知爲了什麼，木板的走廊上，皮靴聲大作，很是熱鬧。這種洋濫活氣的情景，叫人嘡止結舌。當時，領導參觀的山元大尉說道：</p>
<h3>規律的課外生活</h3>
<p>「跑步是日常規律，　也不許慢慢　。軍艦內的動作，務須不放鬆一分一秒地爭取時問，所以平時就要嚴格訓練。不過，也不是任何時候都如此的，在敎室中或自修室內必須從容安　。這在　後可以看到的，那時你將發覺靜得如同在森林裏一樣。你看，他們迅速移步時，都默不作聲。實際上，做事的時候，他們都不許喋喋多言，無論是掃除也好，擦皮鞋也好。都是默默地不作聲。</p>
<p>「到了十二點午餐時。大家都　合在食堂裏，但全體的集合要到五分鐘前方才舉行。最後的五分　固然要緊，但最初的五分鐘在海軍却更重要。無論任何作業，在五分鐘以前，總須是待機的姿態。表面上，看似無關緊要，實際上却與全體有關。及時而起，在艦隊決戰中是緊要的。說明白一點，就是初彈命中的精神」。像觸了電流一樣，在心中感覺到，「或許被敵方潛水艇打死了」。當知道不幸而言中的時候，我們就坐在地上，很難　地哭一通。然後就高聲喊起來，「內地的在校同學們，快放下筆，來參　吧！」</p>
<p>上面見A中尉（東京帝大畢業）所說的話。該校的主要特色，全體師生就好像一家人一樣。</p>
<p>一學生對於我們這批敎員，都以兄長來看待。我們則把在校學生當作弟弟來愛護。我在學生時代從未看見過這樣好的現象，把自已的私生活也都對長官討論。例如結婚也徵求上面的意見。這樣事情，就好像坐在小艦艇裏，　敵潛衛鋒執行特殊任務一樣，我們發生着密切的感情。」</p>
<p>這是B中尉（慶應大學畢業）入學前，從未想到過的海軍生活，他很覺得攻潛學校的這種風氣好。預備學生完成修業年限時，他們所養成的百折不撓的戰鬥精神，足以數畫夜不寢不食，保護著運輸船隊，完成任務。這羣靑年士官，早有鐵石般的耐心，在海防艦，驅潛艇，掃海艇等上，表示着威武堂堂的精神。（譯自每日新開）起，在艦隊決戰中是緊要的。說明白一點，就是初彈命中的精神」。</p>
<p>學生館的大門，豎立着四個圓柱，那裏就是走廊的十字路口。學生們迅速來往着。我們在那裏站了片刻。不久，大尉忽然笑道：</p>
<p>「注意到嗎？你　，學生們沒有一個在柱外走的，他們都在四個柱子當中通行。這並不是有什麼規則或指令要他們如此。在學生間，長久以前，從我做學生的時代起，就有了這樣一條不成文規則：帝國軍人不走偏路，廳堂堂地走正路。上級生也常常這探吿訴下級生。結果，就造成了本校的獨特校風」。</p>
<p>午餐後，到下午二時止，是休息的時間。學生們都出現在廣塲上，分隊各幹：已願做的事。陽光時而　過密雲，被松　和楠木圍繞作邊的練兵塲，也就明亮起來。看吧，那而是騎馬戰，這面在玩　　，滑翔　，汽車，更有些學生在做貓捉老鼠的　　。據說，天氣好的日子他們是不洗衣服的，因爲洗好的衣服祇要交給乾燥所，不問天雨天晴都能立刻幹燥的。比這更有趣的，就是在落　的日子，他們將雪堆成堡壘，而作雪中陣地攻防戰的遊戲。情形非常熱烈悲壯，有時真會打得頭破血流，弄得白雪上染着斑斑血痕。「頑強」就是這校訓育的第一項目標。劍道技擊等，目的也在養成拼撞的鬥志，　　的情良倒在其次。</p>
<h3>奮鬥到底精神</h3>
<p>走進校門，在大禮堂左方，有一條沿山的路，從這路攀登約百餘步，便到了頂。這個小丘，叫做　躅丘。是該校的聖地。頂上有祀皇大神宮的神明社，玉欄外不遠之處，有一座胸像，這是一個神情凜然的學生像，高高安置在二米左右的花崗岩方柱形基座上。這就是第一學年學生大久保帝　的塑像。他本來不識水性，入學後四個月，方始學會遊泳，在一次游泳競賽中，自願參加長距離游泳，盡力奮鬥到最後，終於在n的綫的四五百米處成爲「不歸之客」。他是全校學生頑强精神最好的象徵．在嚴格的訓練中，隱藏着敎官與學生辛苦努力的毅然決然的精神。今日，學生們如有什麽不常的行動，就命★到這個　像前來，或自動的跑來反省懺悔。</p>
<h3>海軍科學的源泉</h3>
<p>「　關學校和兵學校及經理學校，都是養成海軍兵科將校的地方，是海軍科學的泉源，是運用科學　得戰學的幹部養成所，同時也是爲國爭光的技術將校供給部。」的確，它的設備可以誇稱完善。例如在物理學敎室中，陳列的齒輪橫型，不下五六十種，而艦船機關的各部分也一一細分，並有剖開的大汽鍋，以期使人一瞥就可明白其複雜的構造，各項學科，由基本學科的培養到實習，由實習到實踐，務使每個學生出校門就能運用所學，絕不是閉門造車。因此，執敎的敎官個個認真，而不以灌輸知　爲滿足。日本海軍士官就是在這樣的真摯熱誠敎育中造就出來的。全體學生完全寄宿在學校裏，早晟六時天尙未亮的時候，就一齊起床。如此養成學行一致的人格，這種人格，不但能够操縱機械，並能操縱運用機械的人。這就是將校風度。</p>
<h3>海軍經理學校</h3>
<p>早春的陽光透過了廣大的玻璃窗，俯瞰下方，可望見以東京　的　空及隅田川的水面爲背景的校庭。校庭中，一隊裸露上身的學生，正在體操。雖說是早春，連日累債的　　白　　的殘留在日陰處。可是，　世靑年彷彿已經忘却了寒冷。</p>
<p>對面的校舍中，又跑出一隊學生，並列庭中，除下鑲黃綫的黑色　內帽，解開短外衣，卸去白　衫，也加入體操。從校舍裏跑到挽塲上，連脫衣服的工夫也在內，前後不到一分鐘，共動作的敏捷由此可知。向他們發號司令，領導操練的，就是學生中的一個。</p>
<p>他們脫下的短上裝，就是這個海軍經理學校學生的制服。這個學校和海軍兵學校及機關學校一樣，是養成日本海軍士官的地方。校舍舍的大門上，飾有燦然的菊花紋章。在這三所互誇傳統優良而離也不亞於誰的學校中，海軍經理學校的入學者試被稍爲天下無雙的離關。</p>
<p>因爲校名是海軍經下學校，所以一般或許都以爲該校的學生不過是頭戴　章　，手　算　計算銀錢的人物。過去，我就是這樣想的。</p>
<p>「認爲祗有在第一綫直接從事戰鬥的兵科士官與兵員纔是軍人之華的人士，或許以爲主計科稍次一等亦未可知，然而這是大錯誤。因爲不但在實際戰爭中與兵科同進退，就是學校的訓育及學術敎育方面，也和其他兵科學校沒有區別的，况且兵學校，機關學校和經理學校是鼎足而立，共同分擔海軍的運營的。現在，請看學生敎育表。」敎官╳少佐指著張貼在後面屛風上的學生敎育表。大體如次：</p>
<h3>什麼是機關將校魂</h3>
<p>「機關將校魂是什麼呢？」常我詢間這個問題時。得到了下面的問答：</p>
<p>「某艦受到轟炸，速力大減，火舌漸次蔓延開夾，終於不得不全體　艦了，這時，報吿員跑到　開室去通知，不料分隊長却答道：『別管它，先把香烟拿來！這裏是我死的地方。』無論怎樣勸吿，都不肯逃，報吿員無法。祗好退去。等到把香烟拿來，那邊的火勢已很大，不得已用傳聲管作最後的連絡，却聽到那個分隊長大唱其歌，是酒後狂歡的歌哩！而且，那邊的電燈一直到　沉入波中。始終未熄，我們也不管怎樣受到轟炸，不管艦身怎樣搖動。都不想出來看著敵機，而且也不能離開部　。每人都從容做本位的工作。準備死在自已的崗位上，沒有人願意離開本位而逃死。機關室是在軍　裝甲綫下的，通風管附近如果落下炸彈，風就不能進來。而且還有蒸汽管會受損洩汽，同時煤氣也會逃出來的。在如此情形之下，假若無法補救，機關室中的工作員就會全部喪失生命。可是，止住了蒸汽，軍艦就不能動，更易　敵敵機的襲擊。被這情形　困的分隊畏，不知有多少。而毅然部署一切，決不枉死的豪　果斷的精神，即爲隊長風度的表現，同時也是純真至誠的表現。這就是　關將校魂的表徵。」（譯自四十五卷十二號週刊朝日）</p>
<p>精神敎育有勅論·勅語朗誦及衍義·訓話等數課目；訓練則分敎練與作業兩項，有陸戰·短艇·　號·部署敎練·寒天練功·耐寒訓練·乘船實習·露營·游泳訓練·野外演習·閱兵式·帆船訓練·遠划·行軍等十三課目。</p>
<p>勤務有日課作業及諸點檢以下十入課目。體育則將各種武術與運動體技包含在武道·體操·體技之中。在這訓育中，你能嗅出主計科的臭味來嗎？一點也沒有！</p>
<p>在學術敎育方面。可都是專門學科的科目了。如上表所見，在軍事學·基本學·普通學三大門下，合計有四十三科目。而其導師，則網羅海軍敎授以外各界專家積成。至於武道，則斯界泰斗來指導，以全體學生皆具武道標準資格爲目標。每天的課業，夏季五時半·冬季六時起床後，至廿一時四十分的巡檢止，其間沒有一分鐘浪費。再看其每週日課表，一星期七天中，每日十大小時，無所謂例假。而由其使用方法如何，更可數倍其效用。</p>
<p>「入學初時，有不少學生都　悔什麼地方不好去，偏偏要進如此忙的畢校。我們在學生時代也有這樣的感想。但是，經過一個月後，就習慣了，而且還能够在其中找到餘暇。」敎官╳少佐說。他又指着縣在　上的畢業照相道：</p>
<p>「這是我。」</p>
<p>「呵呵，黃毛尙未乾哪　」〇敎官從旁揶揄道。</p>
<p>學生的年級，依照入校期先後的次序，稱爲第幾期學生，或由學年的區別，稱爲第幾學年學生，但在學生問，通常從最高年級起，依次　爲一號生。二號生等。學生的學術敎育，以學年爲單位，設級長次長的制度；而日常訓育訓練生活，則以各級學生編成分隊，由最高年級的學生任分隊的伍長，承分隊監事之命，指導分隊員。╳少佐就是分隊監事。分隊監事由敎官担任，負直接訓育之責，並處理分隊員人事及其他各項事宜。此種各學年混合的分隊制度，爲經理學校學生生活的基本，也是海軍三個學校共通的特色。此外，別設値週學生的制度，由最高年級學生每週輪流負責維持學生隊的軍紀風紀，輔佐日課與作業的施行等事務。値週學生與分隊伍長互相密切縱橫連絡，以兄長的資格負責自治訓練，所以校中直接的指導者是分隊伍長及値週學生。此爲視陸的關鍵。同期學生有了兄弟之愛以後，終生不絕，其相互的關係甚至可及於將來的家族。</p>
<p>學科的時間到了，我又去參觀了他們的敎室。</p>
<p>上工學通論的敎室裏，一位穿普通西裝的敎授正在黑板上圖解，講授制動機的使用方法。課桌上，每個學生都有砲身似的工作器具。的確，這樣的功課就有這樣的東西。</p>
<p>會計學敎室中，學生正練習記載金錢出納。另一間屋子裏，穿文官服的敎官手中拿着大的紙卷模型，正在說明上面的意義；這是國語敎室。在英語敎室隔壁，講台上放着軍艦模型。軍裝的敎官背着地圖而立，講解軍艦構造。</p>
<p>說到軍艦，學生的校內生活就全是根據軍艦勤務的生活。他們畢業時，便是海軍主計少尉候補生，經過一年練習艦隊，聯合艦隊的實地練習，方始成爲合格的海軍主計士官。不過，雖是主計士官，如果除却艦船勤務，海軍的生活也就等於零了。而主計士官的使命，即在經辦爲武力根源的人力給養，物力的整備充實及戰務等。其運用的適常與否，立即可以左右戰鬥力。這在學生服務要綱中也明白記載，所以任務的要　與乘艦精神相通。</p>
<p>「整齊淸楚的帳面。必勝不敗的精神，如此　不愧艦上人。」據╳敎官說，這便是艦船勤務的標語。</p>
<p>轉過長廊，在拾級下階之間，不覺到了浴室前面。探頭一望，大浴槽的蓋縫裏，正冒着熱氣，　了叫人爽快。</p>
<p>從下午三點到四點，是體育的時間。今日據說有三船十段的柔道指導中山　士的劍道指導，但我却想去　觀一下划　　。</p>
<p>短艇是十二支漿的小快艇。漿手穿著白色作業衣，扣上帽帶，由學生伍長指揮。</p>
<p>「右面轉！」　「第六號上半身勿向內側　曲！﹂</p>
<p>應順著學生伍長的口令和指導，十二支　　起　落，羽翼似在水面上掠。五十分鐘的用力劃漿之後，再回到校庭下的掛艇架。</p>
<p>下午五時的晚餐終了，從六時起就開始自修，在三小時的肅靜無聲的溫習時間中，有　分鐘的休息。休息時，每星期有兩次甜食可吃。如果有一個學生恰巧在那天誕生，全體便向他表示賀意。這日恰逢依照定例發甜食的一天。食堂的桌子上，放着甜　麵包，兩個一盆，敎官桌上也一樣。學生監事站在高處大聲問道：「今天生的學生有誰？」於是一個那日誕生的學生站起來陳連自己的出生地和經歷，然後披歷他的感想和抱負。述結，另由學生代表致祝詞，同時大家　掌如雷。</p>
<p>「誰有餘興節目嗎？軍歌，體操都可。別客氣哪，否則懷教官來做啦！」</p>
<p>「我有我有，用各國語言唱愛　進軍歌，」</p>
<p>軍歌唱得很好，可說已登堂入室了。</p>
<p>這樣，在　　的和氣中，　分簡不知不覺溜了過去。</p>
<p>×教官同到教官室時，如此說道：</p>

<h3>海軍知識　軍艦解說</h3>
<p>戰艦</p>
<p>在近代海軍中，戰艦依然是兵力的根幹，爲海戰的主力。但因航本萬能論及其他理論，戰艦無用論及戰艦廢止論曾一度抬頭，以致高據海軍王座的戰艦，其地位發生動搖。至其理由，即戰艦比飛機笨重遲緩，不能迴避飛機的攻擊，面且受不住飛機炸彈和魚雷的攻擊。可是，　艦是攻擊兵器，其防禦力問題決非單純的　　可期完畢，須以防禦爲其攻擊的一種手段總可。因此，正如由於潛水艇一時異常發達而有戰艦無用論出現一樣，由其防禦力的再度强化，戰艦仍能確保某種程度的防禦力，保持其海軍主力的王座。</p>
<p>近代戰艦，以日英美三國的代表戰艦而論，其防禦鋼板的厚簿，有如下列：</p>
<p>英國戰艦的製造，在喬治五世號及威爾斯親王號以後，採用特殊鋼作甲板裝甲，其厚雖減爲十三糎却有顯著的强靱性。據其自誇，此種戰艦能够充分對抗空軍的轟炸，甚至能將大型炸彈彈回。但在日本海軍的肉彈攻擊下，其弱點仍難掩藏，結果不免化爲馬來沿海的藻　。至於美國，則減低其速力為每小時二十六·七浬，由此加强戰艦的防禦力。其對空防禦力雖見增加，然而一受日本神風特別攻擊隊的猛攻，同樣軟弱無力。至此，海軍的空軍化問題遂又提出來討論了。但美國前作戰部長泰島辛海軍少將嘗對戰艦大加讚賞，　如他說所說：「戰艦在海軍的地位，猶如兵在陸軍中所佔的位置。美國倘若從事長期戰爭，可使用到最後的便是戰艦。」戰艦擁有長大的巨砲，宛若浮動砲台，其攻擊力與長遠的續航力及生活力，依然能維繫其地位於不隊，實爲遠征海軍的中堅。</p>
<p>無異戰艦生命的攻擊力，其主要因素就是主砲。各國戰艦的生砲口徑和門數，現已知悉者如次：</p>
<p>日本（長門級）　一六吋砲八門</p>
<p>美國（華盛頓級）　四〇糎砲九門</p>
<p>（柯洛拉多級）　一六吋砲九門</p>
<p>英國（喬治五世級）　三六糎砲一二門</p>
<p>（納爾遜級）　一六吋砲九門法國</p>
<p>（齊金巴爾級）　三八糎砲八門義國</p>
<p>（立特里奧級）　三八糧砲九門</p>
<p>此與四十年前（一九〇六年）在英國樣資茅斯海軍工廠進水而爲當時最大最高水準戰艦的特勒特弩托號（弩級戰艦）所裝十二吋十門的主砲比較，其進步之速，不得不令人驚詫。又近代戰艦中，且有搭載十八吋主砲者，而備有二十糎或十二糎防空用高射砲（約二十門左右），以及高射機關槍（五十門左右）者，更屬不少。</p>
<p>戰艦除扮演海戰的主要角色以外，如美國者更利用其特長，當作保衛航空母艦的砲壘，並用其巨砲轟擊陸地。</p>
<p>由於航空工程的進步，飛機成爲近代海戰的中心威力，航空母艦遂應運而生，所以是比較新的艦種。其特點就是不啻爲用大速力行動的移動飛行塲，並爲足以匹敵巡洋艦的防空砲合，艦上具備飛機格納庫·炸彈庫·兵舍·修理工廠及燃料庫。</p>
<p>今日的航空母艦大概有三種，一種是三萬噸以上的大型制式航空母艦，此類堪與戰艦此擬，另一種爲一萬四千噸至二萬噸的補助航空母艦，約與巡洋艦相當，最後一種則爲商船改造成功的一萬噸左右的護送用航空母艦。正如其排水量的相異，決定其性能的飛機搭載力亦非常不同，即制式母艦可載飛機約一百架，補助母艦約五十架，護送用航空母艦則僅二·三十架。</p>
<p>此外還有專載無須飛行甲板的水上機的水上機母艦，其排水量約一萬噸內外，可收容飛機二·三十架，備有飛行發射軌四·五座。</p>
<p>航空母艦最大的任務，即在自由馳驅火洋上，隨時隨地出動其所載飛機，俾其艦隊得在制空圈內實行決戰。他如接近敵國沿岸，轟炸其後方都市或軍需工廠地帶，亦爲航空母艦的主要任務，因此其續航力必須大，移動速度必須快。尤其是高速力，爲求高性能的快速飛機及逐漸大型化的轟炸機能够在其狹艦的甲板上起飛降落，更屬第一要件，所以各國航空母艦的速力皆有逐漸增至二十浬以上的傾向。</p>
<p>航空母艦的飛行甲板因較其他軍艦甲板廣閣，而在飛機　空降落之際又須對準風向航行，所以是敵方飛機和潛水艇的攻擊目標，但隨飛機的發違進步，其價値日益增高，且有凌駕據有海軍王座的戰艦之勢。因此，大東亞戰爭中，日木神風特攻隊必死必沉的第一個攻擊目標，常常選定了航空母艦。</p>
<p>潛水艇</p>
<p>在飛機第一的近代海戰中，潛水艇因爲有其獨特的　秘性，所以値得重視。潛水艇能秘密逼近敵艦，用有力的魚雷一下擊沉敵主力艦，威力殊堪恐怖，是以潛水艇亦須具有可以和戰艦一同參加艦隊行動的續航力，長期間繼續行動。又在近代海戰中，潛水艇常利用其隱秘性，擔任偵察，索敵，警戒，運輸等任務，實係重要的艦種。而且，潛水艇復使敵國海軍疑盧礤存在於各處海面，結果，在沿岸防衛，通商破壞及陸地防禦上，頗能發揮無上的威力，乃是極有力的兵器。</p>
<p>唯其運動力遲綫，視界狹小，荀爲敵艦或敵機發見，極難敏挺脫離，因而各國今皆力求增加其速力及數量，以往曾一度提倡的潛水艇大型化，現在似已被人遺忘了。</p>
<p>潛水艇的排永量，普通爲六·七百噸至二千噸，水上速力十四·五浬至二十浬，水中速度約每小時十浬內外。備有十至十二糎的大砲，有魚雷發射管五·六門，其續航距離相常可觀，能繼續航海一個月至三個月，所以如果從日本本土的軍港出發，可駛往美國西海岸作戰後再行歸返原港。最新式的潛艇並可搭載飛機。</p>
<p>最後値得一提的，便是美國潛水艇必定和救生船同行。像潛水艇這類特殊艦艇的乘員尚且一味以生命的安全爲念，不能捨身奪戰，則美國海軍的戰鬥力也就可想而知了。</p>
<h3>艦內神社</h3>
<p>日本海戰一舉決定日本存亡的聯合　隊，當明治三十八年（一九〇五年）十二月二十日解散組織時，東鄉司令長官會向所有的部下頒佈訓令：「吾儕軍人實求武力於形而上中」。目前決定日本存亡戰塲上的將士，可以用視死如歸的戰鬥精神來形容。不顧敵人的兵數多大，而只是用精神來向前攻擊。敵英美專靠龐大的鐵量和物量藉作戰鬥的條件，即偏重形而下要素主義，返觀日本，眞有天壤懸殊。日本方面構成傳統的兵術思想根基者，是精神力，即世界各國無與倫比的建國精神所培養出來的軍人精神，即七生報國的戰鬥精神，自我犧牲精神，海軍勇武的傳統精神。</p>
<p>明治二十八年（一八九五年）二月四日，水雷挺隊夜襲威海衛時，伊東司令長官嚴厲命令「本官命諾君擊沉港內敵艦！」各個司令官一齊應諾，立刻傳達各艇長，於是燒毀書類，穿着新衣，拼死進行襲擊。都不希望生還，寗可以自己的生命與敵艦同歸於盡。五十年後的今天，道樣海軍的部統又出現了。</p>
<p>遠在日本海戰前的「聯合艦隊，立刻準備出動殺敵一的東鄉元帥殺敵精神，日俄開戰之初，襲擊旅順港時，曾擊沉及轟毀敵方戰艦兩艘和巡洋艦一艘。「日本奇襲成功」的大東亞戰爭之發動，以及眞珠灣內敵方主力的全軍覆沒，這全不過是日積月累，多年辛苦，日本海軍五十年的傳締。</p>
<p>此外在鋼鐵艦艇上，明顯地也有脈脈相通的靈魂，並且在這同樣的傳統裏，養成堅固不拔的日本性格。來者不拒，百戰百勝，乘長風破萬里浪的帝國艦隊之鋼鐵意志，配以新銳的機械，精鍊的技術，旺盛的精神，卓越的指揮及統帥，這才能產生「必勝不動的信念」這一切相互交織着生命的艦艇，有象徵日本精神的艦內神社。本來軍艦上，供舉着軍艦生命核心的天皇御照，和光輝的軍艦旗。然而在艦內生活上，當作日本人信仰的對象，而必須在身傍有朝夕頂禮膜拜的神　。本來按規則說，軍艦內並不是非有神社不可的。固然不明白怎樣發生的，但按安保淸種大將所證：「我記得甲午中日戰爭時，似乎尚沒有，但在日俄戰爭時業已存在了」。小笠原長生中將也會證明這一點說：「在出體號軍艦上，把出塞大社改爲艦神祭祀的是日俄戰爭以前的事」。但究竟是怎樣發生的，實在令人莫明其妙。</p>
<p>遠自神功皇后討伐三韓的古者，早已祭祀天照大神，而掛八幡大菩薩的旗幟，漂浮於大東亞海的八幡船，下至信仰金刀比羅的漁船，這樣充滿將海上鬥魂的大和民族，對於神的信仰崇拜，可以設虔誠到極點了。現在凡是日本的艦船，就沒有不供奉神的。因此昭和十五年（一九四〇年）十一月三十日，海軍慣例「關於艦船部隊官銜學校等祭神奉齋事」上第一項明文規定稅；</p>
<p>一，艦船神社的正面，宜而艦首。</p>
<p>二，祭祀對象（甲）天照大神爲主神，列於神座中央；（乙）因艦船部隊，官衙學校等而異之神社，或所在地神，宜配列於主神之次位；（丙）略</p>
<p>三，紀念日：伊勢神宮紀念日（豐受神宮十日十六日，皇大神宮十月十七日），艦船入水日，竣工日或神龕落成日。</p>
<p>在這以前，神社的名字總是冠以艦名，艦名如果是國名，則以國家的一個宮命名，如果是山水名，則神社也以山水名，且往往供天照皇大神。凡遇機會時，艦長則組織參拜隊祈禱武運長久，更有對特別請司神來發起道塲。就在平時，划船競賽，打靶大會時，也都參拜神社的，競賽得勝，即將錦標供於神社傍邊。像軍艦這麽樣大家庭的精神中心，是用尊崇民族祖先來維聲的。目前是戰時。神業巳成爲主砲，艦橋，魚雷發射管進行作戰的助力。艦內安靜而稍暗的神社，另外把分身的神移到狹灰的砲塔裏，發射管口近處，甚至在高台射擊指揮所處，似乎睥睨着敵人，日本軍人眞可以說全是神兵。在魚雷上滴以神酒，並貼以護符，然後念念有詞的祈禱。</p>
<p>以前日本潛水艇遠至盟邦德國時，德國海軍看到艦內神社才曉得日本海軍强勝的道理。印度洋潛水艇作戰的新聞電影片「擊沉」上，也會有過艦內神社的塲面。神鑫下貼着擊沉的商船，油槽船等數目。艇員滿頭大汗，泥垢與油膩掛在面頰和脊背上，夾雜着體臭及濁氣的艇內，竟有白木的神龕，兵士虔誠的面孔在神產前祈禱，在這樣的塲面上，凡是日本人都會被感動。</p>
<p>在空襲夏威夷的前夕，飛行員把轟炸描準器供在神龍前面，只禱告希望奇製成功，並未希望生還。</p>
<p>十七年（一九四二年）六月八日上午四時，全隊都在能看見××灣的山腰排列起來。前面有用軍艦旗包着的一個小盒，上面供着白系浜神社的神。不斷聽着橡小島啼聲一樣大聲說；「向白系浜神社敬禮！舉槍！」於是高澈雲霄的喇叭聲音，振起日本國歌的曲調，點繼着北方晨曦的天空。完畢後，大家都用平生的力氣，高呼「天皇陛下萬歲，」（報道班員記）</p>
<p>在所羅門海戰時，夜襲敵人睡眼的艦隊前，在旗艦士官室的黑板上寫着衝的時間：</p>
<p>衝鋒時刻爲下午八時半，一思索到這一點時，總有許之不安，但不安的情緖漸逐加强了。我搖着頭，跑出士官室，順着走廊向左拐，跑到白木製造的神　前而去，默默地站着。神　裏點着明亮的燈。勤務兵舉着槍立在傍邊。神龕仍然是新的。在鋼鐵製造的軍艦內看到了白木社　，令人發生無限的感想。（丹羽報道班員「海戰」）</p>
<p>須臾間，主砲開火了。杜拉基海峽的夜幕，被轟然一響所撕毀，烏暗的海洋，出現了悲壯的火焰，宇宙上的世界，都動搖了。然而在白木的神龕周圍，却靜謐如常。燈光照耀下的勤務兵，像塑像般地站着。像艦橋上立着的艦長一樣固定不動。——</p>
<p>伴隨着民族祖先的神，照耀着四海，走上征途。（譯自朝日新聞）</p>

The Prime Minister spoke about the burning of the Imperial Palace and Omiya Imperial Villa and exhorted the cabinet ministers to strive to renew the administration with unwavering determination. The gist of his speech was as follows: The scale of this air raid was relatively large, and due to the extremely strong winds, there was considerable damage. However, we must not be overly concerned. Such incidents are highly possible during wartime. I hope that all cabinet ministers will work harder and strive to handle state affairs. Many official residences have also been burned down, which may cause inconvenience in handling affairs, but we should take this opportunity to implement reforms and renew the administration, dispel the thought of simply restoring the old, and embrace the spirit of reconstruction. As the people will face increasing hardship due to the damage caused by the air raids, the government must accelerate the implementation of policies. I hope that the policies of each ministry will also change from their usual old practices, overcome all difficulties, and move forward actively.</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Fukuda's Remarks on the 40th Navy Day Anniversary</h3>
<p>Today (27th) is the 40th Navy Day anniversary of our allied nations. Commander-in-Chief Fukuda of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China issued the following statement:</p>
<p>As we celebrate the 40th Navy Day anniversary during the most intense decisive battle stage of the Greater East Asia War, I am deeply moved as I look back on the rise and development of the Imperial Japanese Navy over the past 40 years.</p>
<p>Today, the Imperial Navy is united with the elite Imperial Army, overcoming all difficulties and bravely advancing towards the goal of fulfilling the holy war. In China, we are also securing the battlefields, overcoming many increasingly difficult challenges, and diligently fulfilling our important mission day and night for the future destiny of the East Asian people. The evolution of the European war situation is gradually exerting various influences on the East Asian war situation, which goes without saying. However, the Empire's unwavering policy remains to advance towards the goal of East Asian self-defense, closely cooperating with friendly nations such as the Republic of China to break through all hardships for the co-prosperity of one billion people, and will not waver due to changes in the situation.</p>
<p>We are now facing unprecedented difficulties, but the morale of the naval soldiers is even higher. Today, we will carry on the glory and traditions established by our predecessors, fight to the death to reduce the arrogant enemy, and repay the sacred expectations. We will enhance the welfare of one billion people.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Social Welfare Strengthens Relief Efforts: Minister Peng Releases a Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Minister of Social Welfare Peng Nian met with newspaper reporters from Central China and Japan at the Nanjing Joint Entertainment Club on Zhongshan East Road at 3:00 PM on the 26th. Ministry Secretary Wu Xianren, Su Donglu, and others also attended. The following is a record of Minister Peng's report: The ministry's general policies in recent times are largely similar to those reported previously and will not be repeated here. What I want to report now are the things that are currently being planned to be strengthened and urgently sought to be implemented, which include the following: 1. Strengthening general relief efforts. To meet this need, the ministry is seeking to improve the institutions directly under its control, such as the Central Relief Institute and its five other affiliated branches. 2. Providing relief for air raid disasters. The ministry is focusing its efforts on this and is actively planning a comprehensive relief plan for air raid disasters. 3. Promoting rural welfare services. The ministry has established many rural service stations in Shanghai, Pudong, Longhua, Zhaojiabang, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuhu, Jiangning, Shangxinhe, and Yanziji, and will select appropriate locations to establish seven more rural service stations.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Five Nations Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Stalin Discusses the Factors of Soviet Victory</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to messages received here: Chairman Stalin made a speech at the "Victory Banquet" held in the Kremlin last night, saying, "The unwavering faith of the Soviet people in the government is the key factor in our country's victory this time. Our government authorities have also made mistakes in the past, that is, in 1941 and 1942, our country was indeed in a difficult situation. At this time, our troops had to retreat and abandon many villages and towns. However, our Soviet people did not complain and eventually endured the greatest sacrifices to win the victory over defeated Germany." Finally, he concluded by saying, "This confidence in the government has been proven to be the decisive element in our victory over fascism."</p>
<h3>Unite the East Asian Peoples, Destroy the Arrogant Enemy, England and America: Minister Matsushima's Speech on Navy Day</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima's speech at the Fleet: "As the Greater East Asia War enters a decisive stage, we welcome the 40th Navy Day of Japan. I am extremely grateful that the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association is hosting a commemorative lecture, and I thank all of you for your enthusiastic participation."</p>
<h3>East Asian Countries Work Together</h3>
<p>"What I, as a Japanese person, feel is most meaningful today is that forty years ago, Japan was fighting for the survival of the nation itself, but today it is fighting for the East Asian peoples. For the sake of the self-preservation of all East Asian peoples, Japan does not hesitate to engage in arduous battles with the enemies England and America. Prime Minister Suzuki has expressed his determination to fight to the end to strive for victory."</p>
<p>"Today, Japan is determined to carry out this belief, and hopes that its allied nations, China and other countries, will work together. Japan's war against England and America should not be viewed from the perspective of immediate gains and losses. We should plan for the future of the entire East Asian peoples and carry out our beliefs. Moreover, the fleets, military supplies, and manpower of England and America are now being consumed to a great extent."</p>
<h3>The Enemy is Already Feeling Exhausted</h3>
<p>"The battle for Okinawa Island has been going on for two months, and the enemy has not yet achieved its goals in its own operations. It has suffered heavy losses both at sea and on land. Especially because of the long distance, the long supply lines, and the difficulties in domestic production, it faces various disadvantages. Now that the war in Europe has come to an end, the enemy is attempting to transfer its forces from the European front to East Asia, but due to various political problems in Europe, such as the disputes in Poland, Austria, and Yugoslavia, as well as the problem of food shortages among European residents, it cannot realize its ideal operational objectives. At the same time, the enemy has been exhausted after fighting in Europe for a long time. If it transfers to East Asia, it is questionable whether it can exert its combat power due to the different environment and terrain. On the Japanese side, we have a consistent belief and are determined to carry it out to the end."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the enemy intends to imitate the battle tactics of the European theater in its operations in East Asia, with air power as the main force. However, the situation is completely different in the Greater East Asia War, because the main force in the Greater East Asia War is at sea. It is also questionable whether the enemy's blind actions can achieve the desired results."</p>
<h3>East Asian Compatriots Should Not Kill Each Other</h3>
<p>"In addition, what the enemy feels is most serious is the problem of transportation capacity. The lack of transport ships makes it difficult to replenish troops. Under the necessary conditions for combat, a large force must be concentrated in a very short period of time. In Europe, England and America can still cope, but in the Greater East Asia Sea, it will be difficult to concentrate their forces. Even if England and America transfer their forces to East Asia in the future, it will be a good opportunity for Japan to defeat them one by one. In the past, when the enemy, the United States, operated in the Philippines, it was already exhausted after using 200,000 troops. Now, in Okinawa Island, it originally intended to maintain 100,000 troops, but it has also faced many difficulties and has only managed to deploy 30,000 to 40,000 people so far. Therefore, if they want to launch an operation on the Chinese mainland in the future, they will inevitably use Chinese manpower as the main force. We are all East Asian compatriots and must not allow the enemy to kill each other with their own forces. On this 40th Navy Day anniversary, I salute the soldiers at the front and pledge to realize our goals and overcome difficulties with this determination."</p>
<p>"Finally, we must not be tempted by rumors and should unite the strong unity of the East Asian peoples to bravely advance on the path of destroying the arrogant enemy."</p>
<h3>Soviet Radio Broadcast Attacks on the Vatican</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Moscow Radio broadcast last night, attacking the Vatican for not taking "supporting German Catholics as its basic goal." At the same time, the radio station also criticized the Vatican's newspaper for openly opposing the various measures against Germany decided at the Crimea Conference.</p>
<h3>Responding to the Giretsu Airborne Unit: Japanese Forces on Okinawa Island Launch a Fierce Attack; Enemy Warships Continue to Sink and Many Are Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese defense forces securing the front-line strongholds of Naha and Shuri are continuing to fight fiercely in response to the fierce attacks by the Giretsu Airborne Unit. Enemy forces have advanced south from Yonabaru on the east coast to a point 24 kilometers from that location, arriving at Amagimori one kilometer southeast of that location, and Kogen one kilometer south of that location, and Yonagusuku one kilometer west of that location. Japanese forces are currently launching a fierce attack.</p>
<p>Nansei Base, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Since the night of the 24th, Japanese air forces have continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy's fleet, mobile units, and enemy air bases on the main island surrounding Okinawa. The results of the battle, as confirmed so far, are as follows: More than ten locations at the North and Central airfields exploded and caught fire, sinking two large warships, one cruiser, and one large transport ship, and destroying one medium-sized transport ship. In addition, more than ten pillars of fire were seen on the ground. There were also reports of several instances of hitting and ramming enemy mobile unit regular aircraft carriers. This "enemy landing" by the Giretsu Airborne Unit, coordinated with the fierce fighting of the ground defense forces, and the fierce attacks of the air and land forces as one, are intensifying.</p>
<h3>Repairing Dikes in Various Townships in Wuhu</h3>

If Himmler had not prepared a false name card for himself, he would have been able to survive to this day, because under the current circumstances, no German would have prepared one for himself.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government Return the Towns Under Their Temporary Administration to Each Other: The Township Work is Completed and Returned to the Original Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The towns of Huangdu and Anting, which belong to Jiading County of Shanghai Municipality, were temporarily placed under the administration of the two counties of Kunshan and Qipu in Jiangsu Province during the Jiangsu Province's period of launching the township-cleansing campaign, for the convenience of implementing the blockade of the towns. Afterwards, the Jiangsu Provincial Government reported to the former Township-Cleansing Committee that the township-cleansing work in Jiangsu Province had been completed, and the Shanghai Municipal Government successively requested the Second District Administrative Inspectorate, the Jiading County Government, and the people of the respective townships to recover and restore the administrative system. Therefore, in accordance with the resolution of the National Township-Cleansing Conference in February of the 33rd year that the areas where provinces and cities changed during the township-cleansing period due to blockade relations should be returned to their original administrative system, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was consulted and reported to the Executive Yuan for approval, and they were still returned to the jurisdiction of Jiading County.</p>
<h3>Huangdu and Anting are Still Under the Jurisdiction of Jiading</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government has appointed the Deputy Director of the County Administration Office to represent it in going to Jiangsu Province to discuss the handover matters with the personnel appointed by the provincial government and the relevant bureaus in detail. It has been decided that the following eight key items will be implemented: In addition to the nine townships of Anting Town, Zhujiajiao Town, Huangdu Town, Wangxian Township, Qianmen Township (including part of Waigang Township and Gelong Town), Xisheng Township, Jiwang Township, Puer Township, and Songyang Township, which originally belonged to the Jiading County Government of Shanghai Special Municipality and were temporarily administered by the Jiangsu Provincial Government during the township-cleansing period, should be returned to the jurisdiction of Jiading County in accordance with the Yuan's order,</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipality Returns Towns Under its Temporary Administration</h3>
<p>As for the Liu Xin Township (including part of Haitang Township), Chenxing Township, Ludu Town, Nanjiao Town (including part of Xixin Township and Dongjiao Town), Pingcheng Township, Dongbu Township, Cishan Township, Hengli Township (including part of Chaihang Township), Changqiao Township, Zhangjing Township, Shiqiao Township, Liu Nan Township (including part of Liuhang Town), which originally belonged to Taicang County of Jiangsu Province and were temporarily administered by Shanghai Special Municipality during the township-cleansing period, as well as Qingyi Special Township, Qing'er Special Township, which originally belonged to Xiaopu County, and Zhuhang Town, Chunshen Town, Banqiao Township, Shajiang Township, Zhaolin Township, Huqiao Township (part of the Sixth Bao), which belonged to Songjiang County, a total of 20 townships, because the township-cleansing work has been completed in both places, it has also been decided to return them at the same time.</p>
<h3>Handover to be Completed Simultaneously on July 1</h3>
<p>As for the handover period, it has been agreed by both parties that the handover will be completed simultaneously on July 1 of this year.

<h3>The Decisive Battle of the Japanese and American Navies</h3>
<p>— Zhu Rusong</p>
<p>Just as the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War was decided by the Battle of Tsushima, before the final success or failure of the Greater East Asia War is determined, a decisive naval battle between Japan and the United States must first occur on the Pacific Ocean. Now, the time for the decisive naval battle is approaching. At this moment, we are pleased to celebrate the 40th Japanese Navy Day. Looking back on the past, we can foresee the future. I will now examine the characteristics of the Japanese Navy and the prospects for this decisive battle.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, the fleets of Japan and Russia engaged in a major battle east of the Tsushima Strait. As a result, the Japanese Combined Fleet, under the command of Marshal Togo, achieved a final victory by overcoming the enemy with fewer forces. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following points:</p>
<p>Japan's campaign was to resist the aggression of Imperial Russia. Therefore, the entire country shared the same hatred and united as one. Furthermore, with the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, everyone, regardless of whether they were at the front or the rear, was willing to dedicate themselves to the country. The morale was extremely high. This spirit of sincere unity and devotion to the country was the spiritual foundation for Japan's victory over Russia.</p>
<p>At that time, Marshal Togo of Japan set up an ambush in the vital areas of Japan's coastal waters, waiting for the Imperial Russian fleet to walk into the trap. Because the Russian Baltic Fleet had traveled a long distance across the ocean and was exhausted, while the Japanese Combined Fleet was well-rested and waiting for the enemy to tire, it was able to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop, laying the foundation for the final victory.</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy's excellent training, the outstanding talent of its commanders, and the superiority of its tactics and strategy were also important factors in defeating the enemy. Therefore, less than half an hour after the Japanese and Russian fleets opened fire, the Russian fleet was in chaos and eventually collapsed.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the naval battles between the Japanese and American forces have numbered no less than several dozen. During this time, the Japanese Navy, based on its glorious traditional spirit, demonstrated admirable strength everywhere, such as in the Battle of Hawaii, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Taiwan, the Battle of the Philippines, and the Battle of Okinawa. Especially since the start of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese military's Kamikaze Special Attack Units displayed their power, dying together with the enemy. We can also see this tragic determination to sacrifice oneself for benevolence in the Russo-Japanese War, when the Japanese military besieged Lushun. Currently, Japan's operations in the Pacific against the United States have several similarities to the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>First, this time, Japan is fighting against Britain and the United States for self-preservation and to shatter the ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade East Asia. It is a righteous army with resolute fighting spirit. Conversely, Britain and the United States are fighting for aggression, sacrificing lives and resources for the benefit of a few financial cliques. Anti-war sentiments have already arisen in the enemy's countries. Moreover, the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have currently formed a very delicate situation. Therefore, Britain and the United States feel deeply anxious and restless about the current situation.</p>
<p>Second, today, the American forces are in a position of external operations. Communication with the rear is very inconvenient. They must cross the vast Pacific Ocean and travel a long distance of 10,000 kilometers to reach the front lines. As for the British fleet, it must pass through the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. Therefore, how to fully supply the troops fighting at the front and maintain their offensive power and mobility is indeed a very difficult problem for them. Conversely, Japan's transportation lines are very short, and it is fighting in the waters near its own country, clearly occupying the advantages of geography and human relations. Therefore, as long as the opportunity arises, it can strike the enemy with a fatal blow in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Third, the modern Japanese Navy not only continues to maintain their traditional superior spirit, but is also greatly strengthening its power and sharpening its swords. On the first of this month, the Naval General Headquarters was re-established, and General Toyoda was appointed as the first Commander-in-Chief, completing the integration of the Japanese Combined Fleet and all naval combat units under the jurisdiction of the various naval districts and guard districts, thereby better adapting to the complexity of modern warfare.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two more points worth noting: First, in modern warfare, aircraft have become the main weapon, playing a decisive role in the outcome of the war. And the Japanese mainland is now no less than a great aviation fortress. Therefore, when Britain and the United States approach Japan, they suffer great losses due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air force. For example, in the Okinawa area, from March 23 to May 10, the enemy has already lost more than 510 ships. In the future, their losses will inevitably increase day by day. Second, Japan's campaign this time is not only supported by the united will of the entire nation, but also receives the assistance of the East Asian nations that have been invaded, thereby strengthening its momentum.</p>
<p>No matter how the future war situation develops, the closer the enemy approaches Japan, the more severe the blows they will inevitably suffer, the greater the price they will pay, and the more difficulties they will encounter. The isolated forces that penetrate deep into the country may even be completely annihilated. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>Today is the 40th Japanese Navy Day. In addition to expressing our infinite respect for the glorious history of the Allied Navy, we also firmly believe that in the future decisive naval battle, the Allied forces will surely establish even greater achievements than in the past, and bring the Greater East Asia War to a final victory!</p>
<h3>Commanding from the Bridge: The Glorious Tradition of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>"How many hours have passed since the warship left the base?" the commander on the bridge thought absently. Mealtime had already passed. It was said that he had little time to sleep, simply leaning back in his chair in his uniform. But he wasn't as young as I was. Although his face was tanned red and black, he was quite old. If I were to stand for an hour or two, my legs would ache. How many hours would the commander have to stand? Regardless of whether the enemy came or not, he was always facing the sky, looking for enemy traces, and watching the sea, guarding against the appearance of submarines. He stood silently like that. Even the watchmen had rotating shifts, but there was no one to relieve the commander. And to constantly guide the pursuing warship, deciding direction and speed. How arduous and meritorious this was! Despite such hardship, the commander stood on the front lines like a bronze statue. This spirit of absolute responsibility is truly awe-inspiring."</p>
<p>This is what a reporter who recently returned from the bloody battlefield said. "The commander standing motionless like a bronze statue…" As we face the 40th Navy Day, gazing at the smoke-filled Pacific Ocean, the 100 million citizens must all burn with the same hatred and determination as the commander. History has told us, and has taught us.</p>
<h3>Moving Lines of Poetry</h3>
<p>"The Admiral Standing on the Bridge" is the most moving line of poetry for us. The protagonist in songs such as "The Brave Sailor's Song" and "The Still Living Zhenyuan" (定遠號), Third Class Seaman Miura, died in battle during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Commander Ito, who completely defeated Ding Ruchang's Beiyang Fleet in the Yellow Sea decisive battle, also stood steadfast on the bridge of the flagship Matsushima amidst the hail of bullets.</p>
<p>The calm and composed demeanor of Commander Togo in the painting "Bridge of the Mikasa" depicting the Battle of Tsushima truly expresses the spirit of "the rise and fall of the island nation hinges on this battle," and truly reflects the spirit of "only with a country can there be a home." Furthermore, Marshal Yamamoto Isoroku, wearing the most glorious badge for wounded soldiers, with his left hand wrapped in a snow-white glove holding a saber, and the famous Marshal Koga Mineichi, we can all imagine that they were always standing on the bridge like bronze statues.</p>
<p>Commander Yamaguchi and Captain Kaku, who sang praises of Marshal Yamamoto, "Our Japanese admirals standing amidst the smoke and fire on the bridge," all stood on the bridge commanding, spending the long nights on the Pacific Ocean, watching the faint moon with their staff in silence. This posture is a sublime beauty only seen in sacred office. Furthermore, on the burning warship, Vice Admiral Yanagimoto, bearing his wounds, continued to give his final orders from the signal platform, gradually disappearing into the ocean like a god in the flames. He was still "commanding from the bridge" at the moment of his death, inspiring endless admiration in us.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Commanding from the Bridge</h3>
<p>The captain of a ship, the commander of a fleet, or the commander of an entire fleet, all stand at the front of the most dangerous warship. In April of the spring of Showa 16 (1941), when local officials participating in the upcoming pilgrimage to the capital were invited to visit a certain flagship at Yokosuka Naval Port, a certain prefectural governor asked:</p>
<p>"The commander-in-chief is always on the flagship targeted by enemy bullets, especially standing on the most dangerous bridge. From the perspective of the overall situation, is this correct?"</p>
<p>Admiral Yamamoto calmly replied: "This is a naval tradition upheld by generations of commanders since the Yellow Sea naval battle in the Sino-Japanese War."</p>
<p>This prefectural governor's question was by no means unreasonable. If the commander-in-chief were to make a mistake, wouldn't it affect the entire situation? However, the so-called "if there were a mistake" is something that the Japanese Navy would absolutely not encounter. Before one's own death, always strike down the enemy first. The fierce fighting spirit contained in this "commanding from the bridge" is precisely the "victory is assured, attack is certain" glorious achievements in our Japanese naval war history.</p>
<h3>Marshal Togo's Spirit</h3>
<p>On the eve of the Battle of Tsushima, the base of the Japanese Combined Fleet was moved to the Inland Sea islands. Soon after, the No. 48艇 of the 大島 (Ōshima) and the cruiser Miyako struck mines and sank. The "Yoshino" collided with the "Kasuga" while returning to base from outside Port Arthur and sank. In addition, the battleships Hatsuse and Yashima sank after striking mines while blockading Port Arthur. This series of unfortunate events, especially the loss of the Hatsuse and Yashima, two of the six main battleships, was a major blow to the navy at the time. Even the Japanese fleet's officers and soldiers were somewhat discouraged. At this time, there was a loud sound of footsteps on the deck behind the flagship Mikasa. It was Marshal Togo, with a smile on his kind face. Honestly speaking, what saved the Japanese Navy from its greatest crisis during the Russo-Japanese War was the eternal smile of Marshal Togo standing on the bridge.</p>
<p>One day in Showa 8 (1933), Dr. Matsunami Niichiro visited Marshal Togo and said, "You are very old (87 years old). Can you still command a large fleet in battle?" The Marshal replied, "My legs are not good. It is difficult to go up and down the bridge." Dr. Matsunami then asked the Marshal, "If someone helps you up to the bridge, can you still command in battle?" The Marshal's reply was powerful: "That I can!" Upon hearing these words, Dr. Matsunami immediately ran to the Navy Ministry and requested to see Navy Minister Osumi Mineo. He told the Navy Minister every detail of his conversation with Marshal Togo. Upon hearing that Marshal Togo could still command the Combined Fleet, Minister Osumi said, "Thank you!" He immediately convened the Navy Ministry's key officers and said, "I want to tell you all about Dr. Matsunami's conversation with Marshal Togo just now. What is most touching is that a person as old as the Marshal can still command a large fleet in battle." The listeners were greatly moved and immediately issued a notice to each fleet.</p>
<p>The heroic spirit of being able to command in battle on the bridge at the age of 87, the spirit that was used to defeat the enemy 39 years ago in the Battle of Tsushima, and to establish Japan's eternal national foundation in one battle. Now, Japan's naval warriors are as numerous as the clouds, and they will surely quell the raging waves of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h3>Always in Battle</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Turaqi night raid wrote down the following facts.</p>
<p>The night raid tactics and exercises are indistinguishable. The bridge is always quiet. The daily routine of "each to their post" is the same. There is no excitement anywhere. In the blink of an eye, a world-shaking decisive battle will occur, yet no waves are stirred on the hearts of the soldiers. It's as if the bridge is made of steel; there's utter silence. I will never forget this night sea battle. The sailors wholeheartedly swab the deck. Their posture is no different from usual. What is most admirable is that they still carry out their daily tasks as usual afterwards. This is deeply imprinted on my heart.</p>
<p>After winning the Battle of Tsushima, Marshal Togo ordered his subordinates on the way back to Sasebo, "Let's conduct combat training!" The meaning of Marshal Yamamoto's "always on the battlefield" and Marshal Koga's "constant battle" were also clearly recorded by this reporter for the first time. Riding the sirocco blowing from Arabia and sailing across the raging waves of the Indian Ocean, just as shown in the movie "The Silent Victory," the countless victories gained since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War can all be attributed to the "bridge command" established by the commanders.

<h3>Commemorative Allied Navy Day First Speech Yesterday Sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the News Association</h3>
<p>Today (the 27th) is the 40th Allied Japanese Navy Day. To commemorate it, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association held a speech meeting yesterday (the 26th) at 5:00 PM at the Grand Theatre. Colonel Matsushima, the reporting director of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, was invited to give the speech. Colonel Matsushima, along with Lieutenant Matsumoto, Lieutenant Hirata, and others, attended on time. Chen Binhe, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and Osaka Yoichi, the executive director, were also present. First, Chairman Chen Binhe delivered a speech and invited Colonel Matsushima to speak (the speech can be found on the first page), lasting thirty minutes. Then, the Shanghai Light Music Troupe played music, Miss Mizuhara sang, Mr. Takatori sang a solo, and Miss Fujieda performed a piano solo. The Hua Ying famous film "Ten Thousand Households Renewed" was also screened. The event ended at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Binhe said in his speech: "Today, May 27th, is the 40th anniversary of the Allied Japanese Navy Day. The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association is holding this speech meeting to commemorate it, and we have invited Colonel Matsushima, the reporting director of the Allied Fleet, to speak.</p>
<p>As you all know, Japanese Navy Day commemorates the Japanese Navy's surprise victory over the Imperial Russian Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima under the leadership of Marshal Togo during the Russo-Japanese War forty years ago. This not only laid the foundation for the victory of the Russo-Japanese War but also established the excellent tradition of the Japanese Navy's spirit. Over the past forty years, especially in the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy's brave attacks against the enemy have been a full expression of the naval spirit. Naval military strategies may differ between now and then, but the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy remains the same. This is a point worth recognizing when commemorating Navy Day today."</p>
<p>Second Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the News Association will also host a speech meeting for students from major middle schools in the city at 10:00 AM today (the 27th) at the Dahua Theatre. Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, the principal of the Central Naval Academy, will be invited to speak.</p>
<h3>Governor Ren Visits Shanghai, Hosting a Banquet for Leaders from All Walks of Life, Thanking Shanghai for Organizing Jiangsu Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province, in order to express his gratitude for the Shanghai Municipal Government and the business and financial communities organizing agricultural loans for Jiangsu, visited Shanghai the other day to meet with relevant parties. Last night, he hosted a banquet at 2 Xianyang Road, inviting officials from the Municipal Government, the agricultural loan committee of the Municipal Advisory Committee, and various personnel related to the agricultural loan syndicate. Those present included Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government and heads of various bureaus and departments, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Qian Dalou, Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Sun Yaodong, Liu Ruxiang, Zhu Rutang, Dai Ailu, Ye Fuxiao, Wu Yong'an, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhao Zhengping, Zhang Rongchu, Zhang Ruitang, Tong Lvqing, Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbo, and others. From the Japanese side, Councillor Okazaki from the Embassy, Department Chief Kaneko from the Jiangsu Liaison Department, and experts Nasu, Watanabe, Inoue from the Flour and Wheat Association, and Ueda from the Rice Control Association were present. Governor Ren, along with Director Pei of the Finance Department, Director Sun of the Construction Department, Director Ren of the Bank, and others, personally hosted the event. In total, there were approximately eighty guests from both China and Japan.</p>
<p>Governor Ren's Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Governor Ren gave a speech, stating that the relationship between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province is becoming increasingly close. This time, the Municipal Advisory Committee proposed organizing agricultural loans for Jiangsu, and the Municipal Government and the business and financial communities fully facilitated it. He would like to express his gratitude on behalf of the farmers of Jiangsu Province. Before that, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and other gentlemen from the Shanghai business community visited Jiangsu Province and personally inspected the Dongting West Mountain. They did not hesitate to travel to develop the region, and their enthusiasm is commendable. Shanghai's grain problem is of great concern to Jiangsu Province. In the close relationship, we should cooperate to solve it. With the success of this agricultural loan, we will certainly do our best to cooperate to meet the expectations of all sectors in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo then gave a speech, stating that the food problem has always been the most serious livelihood problem in Shanghai, and it is currently even more serious. The solution requires the joint efforts of all parties, especially the practical help of Jiangsu Province. Shanghai's agricultural loans directly help farmers in Jiangsu Province, and indirectly, it is also for its own sake. Therefore, the Municipal Government will do its best to facilitate it. Finally, Mr. Li Sihao, Chairman of the Agricultural Loan Syndicate Committee, delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of the agricultural loan and expressing his gratitude for the sincere assistance of the Jiangsu Province authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Governor Ren's banquet featured simple dishes, fully complying with the spirit of frugality. The atmosphere was harmonious and cheerful, which was a characteristic of the banquet.</p>
<h3>Acting Director Liu of the Economic Bureau Takes Office at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>Xu Jiang, the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, was approved to resign for war reasons. Liu Xingchen, the Director of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, was appointed as the acting director. The bureau has now ordered all departments to complete the handover preparations. It is said that Acting Director Liu will take office at the beginning of June. As for the cancellation of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, it will also be announced on the same day. All future household allocation matters will be handled by a department established within the Economic Bureau.</p>
<p>Relocation of Three Issuance Offices</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the issuance of certificates to residents in the Nanshi area, the Municipal Goods Allocation Office originally established the 17th, 18th, and 19th Issuance Offices at the original site of the Grain Bureau. They were responsible for issuing household allocation certificates for the Yimiao, Pengpu, and Xieqiao households. Now, because the main building of the Grain Bureau has other uses, the 17th Issuance Office has been moved to the Homeless Labor Camp on Penglai Road, which was formerly the relief center. The 18th Issuance Office has been moved to the downstairs of the Grain Bureau dormitory building, and the 19th Issuance Office has been moved to 171 Zhaozhou Road, Nanyang Bridge Police Station. All have been completed and are open for business. It is also learned that the First Issuance Office, originally located at the Racecourse, has now been returned to the Yunnan Road Renji Shantang Office, and the Second Issuance Office has also moved to Gordon Road to work in the same location as the Third Issuance Office.</p>
<p>Allocation Items Exempt from Transit Tax</p>
<p>When the Municipal Goods Allocation Office transported items such as fertilizer, soap, and matches to the residents of the north and south districts of Pudong, they had to declare and pay taxes, which affected the allocation price and delayed the time. The office has specifically submitted a request to the Municipal Government to request the customs authorities to waive the transit tax. The Municipal Government has submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance to be forwarded to the Jianghai Customs for exemption.</p>
<h3>Factory Licenses are Issued by the Construction Bureau, Those Registered with the Economic Bureau Must Still Apply</h3>
<p>In the past, factories in the jurisdiction of this city were managed by the factory division of the former Public Works Bureau. After the Public Works Bureau merged into the Construction Bureau, the factory licenses were issued by the Construction Bureau. Subsequently, factories in the city, whether in urban or suburban areas, with ten or more workers, or equipped with boilers or power machinery, must apply to the Second Section of the Construction Bureau on Hankou Road in accordance with the regulations. Even those who have already obtained a factory registration certificate from the Economic Bureau must still obtain a factory license to ensure industrial safety and increase production efficiency.</p>
<p>Vehicle Registration Certificate for Entry and Exit</p>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that vehicle theft incidents often occur when citizens go to vehicle registration offices in various districts to register their vehicles. In order to prevent this, it has decided that each registration office will issue a special vehicle entry and exit certificate. It is stipulated that in the future, vehicles going for registration must enter and exit with the entry and exit certificate. Otherwise, if it is found that there is no entry and exit certificate, the theft of the vehicle will be investigated.</p>
<p>Shanghai Military Vehicles Limited to Military Personnel</p>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that the Shanghai Military vehicle license plates were originally special license plates for use by the local defense forces. Recently, it has been reported that some vehicles with Shanghai Military license plates have women riding in them, are parked in entertainment venues, or are even used to transport goods. These should be corrected separately to rectify the situation. It is now stipulated that only military personnel, military dependents, and those wearing uniforms can ride in vehicles with Shanghai Military license plates. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government to instruct the military agencies in the city to pay attention to this at any time, and a letter has been sent to the Shanghai Special City Liaison Department to contact the relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Cooperate with China to Achieve Independence and Sovereignty</h3>
<p>After attending the Liaison Conference of Ambassadors to China held by the Greater East Asia Ministry, Minister Tsuchida returned to his post in China on the 24th. On the afternoon of the 26th, at 2:30 PM, he delivered a speech to the embassy staff in the embassy conference room, reporting on the conference and the opinions of the Japanese government. The gist of his speech stated: The current situation is extremely serious. In view of the trend of the war and the changes in the international situation, Japan is clearly facing a difficult situation. In order to achieve the goals of the war and adhere to the determination to carry out the war, the government and the command are closely integrated to promote policies. The China issue has become increasingly important. However, Japan's policy toward China will never change. The Japanese government is now cooperating with China to complete its unification and its independent sovereignty, and is making every effort to establish friendly relations based on equality and mutual benefit, overcoming all obstacles. All of this depends on the efforts of everyone. Regarding the operation of various economic policies, we will resolutely abide by the purpose of the Outline of Countermeasures for Establishing a Wartime Economy in China, strive for development, and proceed with the unified cooperation of the garrison authorities, in order to live up to the expectations of the country.</p>
<h3>Old Zhabei Police Station Intensifies Night Patrols</h3>
<p>The Old Zhabei Branch of the Police Bureau began implementing night patrols on the 25th of this month. When the team patrolled near Fuzhou Road at 4:30 AM, they captured a cigarette theft suspect named Wang Zhenhou. According to his confession, the cigarettes were stolen from a cigarette shop at 264 Tianjin Road. Subsequently, they also seized 72 boxes of cigarettes at 15 Shudeli, Zihua Road in the Nanshi area, and arrested three suspected accomplices, including Zhang Daliang, in room 221 of the Daxin Inn on Guangxi Road. The details are still under close investigation. The first day of night patrols resulted in a theft case, and investigations are now being intensified.</p>
<h3>Ice Vendors Manipulate Market Prices, Should Be Banned</h3>
<p>The machine-made ice necessary for the city's ice and seafood industry was previously produced by more than ten factories. However, since electricity was restricted, the factories were affected and closed down one after another. Today, only Qia He and Qia Mao remain. Since the beginning of summer, the demand for ice has been extremely high for the ice and seafood industry, as well as restaurants and other shops. This has led intermediaries (i.e., general ice vendors) to manipulate the market, pushing prices up to 135,000 yuan per ton. In addition, ice stalls and vendors are required to pay tips if they want to open an account to purchase directly. It is hoped that the authorities will severely crack down on these manipulators.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Japanese Navy Day, Understanding the Spirit of the Japanese Navy: City Propaganda Office Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>The City Propaganda Office held a broadcast lecture yesterday in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Allied Japanese Navy Day, which stated:</p>
<p>"Commemorating Japanese Navy Day, we must first recognize the great spirit of the Japanese Navy, past and present. During the war between Japan and Imperial Russia, Marshal Togo, with both courage and wisdom, completely destroyed the fleet of Imperial Russia, astonishing the world. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has relied on its three excellent qualities: first, its strong fighting spirit; second, its unwavering belief in victory; and third, its innovative and clever scientific power, causing unprecedented damage to Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>This year, in order to seize naval and air supremacy, Britain and the United States have launched continuous attacks on Luzon Island, Iwo Jima, the waters near Japan, and Okinawa Island. The Japanese Navy is determined to inherit the immortal historical achievements left by its predecessors in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, to be mindful of the many past difficulties, to cope with the enemy's operations, to make the destruction of the enemy the key to victory, and to maintain a calm and unwavering posture in the face of danger.</p>
<p>The necessary victory of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the East Asian peoples make it impossible for us not to admire the power of the Japanese Navy and the brave and sacrificial fighting spirit of its naval officers and soldiers."</p>

<h3>Two Police Officers Executed for Extorting People's Property: Shot to Death in the Racecourse This Morning</h3>
<p>The case of police officers Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping of the Huashan Road Branch of the Police Bureau, who extorted people's property, has been concluded by the Special Court Shanghai Branch. The two defendants, Li and Du, were each sentenced to death. The sentence was approved by Chairman Chen of the National Government in Thailand and was scheduled to be executed by shooting at 9:00 AM today (the 27th) in the Racecourse Square. The original text of the judgment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Judgment of the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court of the National Government, No. 6 of the Special Character 34. Defendant Li Hongxin, male, 21 years old, from Yancheng, resident of 3479 Changshou Road, occupation: police officer; Du Zhiping, male, 24 years old, from Shandong, resident of Huashan Police Branch, occupation: police officer. The right defendants were handed over to this court by order of the National Government for a case of extorting people's property. The judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping, acting jointly, intentionally sought illegal gains, used their power, and extorted people's property through violence and coercion. Each is sentenced to death and fined 50,000 yuan, and deprived of public rights for life. If the fine cannot be paid, it will be converted into labor service based on the ratio of the total fine to the number of days in six months. The illegal gains of 70,000 yuan will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping are both police officers of the Huashan Police Branch in this city. At 5:00 AM on April 5th of this year, wearing uniforms, they, together with Zhai Suozeng, a police officer who had been dismissed from the bureau, and Gu Weiliang, who is at large, set up a name of checking pedestrians' residences at the intersection of Yuguo Road and Jiangsu Road, seeking illegal gains. Subsequently, Chen Gencai, a pedestrian carrying a net bag, was walking alone, passing through the area. Li Hongxin first ordered him to stop and shouted to Zhai Suozeng as "Team Leader Wang," and stepped forward to ask for his residence certificate. Chen Gencai showed a damaged city resident certificate. They used this as an excuse to pretend to take him to the police station, urging him to walk towards Jiangsu Road. When they reached the wasteland of Dongzhu'anbang, they suddenly stopped. Du Zhiping and Zhai Suozeng searched him but found nothing. Then, they found 70,000 yuan in cash in the net bag. Zhai Suozeng handed it over to Li Hongxin, who then handed it over to Gu Weiliang. Using the pretext of making a fake phone call, they urged the two to take the money and flee. Chen Gencai, seeing that the money had been taken, followed Du Zhiping and Zhai Suozeng closely. Seeing that they could not be deceived, Zhai Suozeng found Gu Weiliang and escorted Chen Gencai eastward. When they reached Meijia Bridge, Gu Weiliang pushed him into the small river and fled in different directions. Chen Gencai reported the incident to the branch, which arrested them and reported it to the mayor of the city, who reported it to the National Government, which ordered this court to hear the case.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The defendants are incumbent police officers and are responsible for maintaining local public order. They should cherish their reputation and serve as an example. However, they used their authority to check residence permits and escorted the victim to a remote location, where they conducted a search and ultimately extorted property through violence and coercion. After reviewing the circumstances of the crime, it is unpardonable. They should each be sentenced to the maximum penalty to maintain law and order and serve as a warning for the future. The illegal gains of 70,000 yuan will be confiscated in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Yuyou Road Fire Relief Association Plans to Build a Public Housing Village</h3>
<p>Needs Huge Funds, Continued Fundraising for One Week</p>
<p>The unprecedented fire on Yuyou Road in Shanghai West caused huge losses and left thousands of victims destitute and in distress, which is very tragic. Previously, people in the area launched and organized a temporary relief committee to handle relief work, such as burying the dead, treating the injured, and working with various charitable organizations to provide porridge and other tasks. This continued for more than ten days, and the victims benefited greatly. The emergency relief work has now come to an end, and the housing problem, which is a real need for the victims, needs to be resolved urgently. Therefore, an expanded organization of the temporary relief committee was convened at the Tingyue Restaurant at 4:00 PM on the 25th to achieve greater effectiveness. Chen Binhe, Lin Kanghou, Gu Jiwu, and other 30 people attended. Chairman Dai Aiying gave an opening speech, followed by Le Fenglin and Wu Songquan reporting on the details of the fire and the handling process. Then, the organization of the committee was discussed. Wen Lanting, Yan Huiqing, Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, and other eleven people were publicly elected as honorary members; Dai Ailu, Shen Siliang, Pang Zhe, Zhu Shunlin, Ju Mengbai, Yang Jingbing, Le Fenglin, and other seven people were elected as standing committee members; Fan Yifeng, Xue Hongkun, Tong Luqing, Yan Qingling, Wu Songquan, Yuan Jiping, Xian Zhang, Qian Zong, Zhu Wenyue, Le Boming, and other twenty-four people were elected as members; Ye Fuxiao, Zhang Deqin, and Yao Benyuan were elected as economic management committee members. The following motions were discussed:</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Binhe proposed that the Shenbao had received donations of over 18 million yuan and hoped that the association would prepare a letter to withdraw the funds for use. Resolved: The emergency relief work in the disaster area has been completed, and in the future, real relief will require huge funds. Please ask Shenxin and Liangbao to continue fundraising for one week to achieve greater effectiveness. Mr. Lin Kanghou proposed that the fundamental solution to disaster relief can be divided into two points: one is to provide a place for the victims to live, and the other is to eliminate future troubles. Therefore, it is urgently needed to build a rationalized public housing village. Resolved: In addition to expanding fundraising, join forces with other charitable organizations to plan the construction.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Mengbai proposed to submit a request for assistance from the Advisory Committee and relevant authorities, and to send letters to various charitable organizations to cooperate in relief efforts. Resolved: It should be done immediately, and donation books should be printed and actively promoted, and many other motions were resolved, all of which were handed over to the Standing Committee for handling.</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society Handles Emergency Relief</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate the disastrous fire on Yuyou Road in order to seek truth from facts. After consulting with the Lianbao Jia chiefs in the area, the poorest households among the victims were selected for emergency relief. Yesterday, 67 people from the poorest households in the fifth Bao of the sixth Lianbao were given 5,000 yuan in savings certificates per person, totaling 335,000 yuan. In addition, the poorest households in each Bao will continue to be granted emergency relief after the Lianbao Jia chiefs in the area verify and open a list. As for the housing problem for the victims, the Lianbao chief is now uniformly allocating housing, allowing various charitable organizations and philanthropists to bear the construction as much as possible. It is reported that the labor and materials for each house cost about 500,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The Swastika Society plans to assume responsibility for building twelve houses for the victims to live in and is actively raising funds.</p>
<p>Our Office Will Continue to Collect Donations for Another Week</p>
<p>This office has approved the Yuyou Road Fire Relief Committee's request to continue collecting donations for another week. Relief is our duty, and we cannot refuse. We will continue to collect donations for another week, from May 27th to June 2nd. We still ask all sectors to enthusiastically contribute and share the same feelings.</p>

<h3>Airborne Troops in Modern Warfare</h3>
<p>— Junmin</p>
<p>The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on May 25 that the "Giretsu Airborne Unit," a special army attack unit, forcibly landed at the northern and central airfields of Okinawa Island on the 24th, taking advantage of the moonlight to destroy enemy US military supply warehouses and battlefield facilities. At the same time, the Japanese special attack flying units also provided support from the side, fiercely attacking enemy US warships around Okinawa Island. How the Japanese army, with its entire force transformed into special attack units, fought and assisted in the war is not the focus. Although the details of the achievements obtained this time have not been announced immediately, according to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, the former has caused great confusion to the enemy forces, while the latter is continuing to attack. From this, we can see the profound significance. In the near future, the details will be announced to the world by the Japanese General Headquarters. As for the impact, it will be manifested in the decisive battle between Japan and the United States centered on Okinawa Island. The fierce attack of the Japanese special attack units is a tactic to accumulate factors for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Airborne Troops</h3>
<p>Airborne troops, as the name suggests, are units transported to the airspace over enemy strongholds in large passenger planes that can carry 20 to 50 people, and then parachute down. Sometimes, they are transported by glider. Two or three gliders are towed by a large plane, flying over enemy strongholds, and then released separately for a group landing. Judging from the above situation alone, it seems no different from an airborne infantry unit. However, their weapons are different from those used by infantry, being smaller and more sophisticated. Most airborne troops carry extremely sophisticated small machine guns, as well as small mortars. In large-scale airborne operations, gliders are used to transport tanks, motorcycles, etc., so the mobility and combat power after landing are great. Their attacks are fierce and powerful, which cannot be compared to simple infantry. In addition, before landing, they conduct thorough reconnaissance from the air or ground, selecting places where the enemy's defenses are weak or easiest to attack. Therefore, unlike ground troops, they can greatly limit the enemy's ability to exert its combat power. Suddenly descending from the sky, while the enemy is caught off guard, they rely on their high mobility to launch a preemptive strike, breaking down the enemy one by one before they can concentrate their forces, and achieving great results.</p>
<p>In this operation of the Giretsu Airborne Unit, roughly one part landed in the mountains near the airfield, attacking the enemy's supplies and aircraft hangars, while another part landed in the center of the airfield. Before the enemy's heavy weapons defending the airfield could open fire, they stopped its activities, so they were able to successfully destroy various military facilities and burn the planes parked on the ground after landing.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Modern Air Warfare</h3>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that airplanes are the main weapons of today's war. The Japanese army and navy achieved unprecedented victories in the Greater East Asia War, and the driving force behind this was the strength of the air force. The main reason for Germany's failure in Europe can be attributed to the inferiority of its air force. From this, it can be seen that the rise and fall of air power determine the victory or defeat of modern warfare.</p>
<p>The enemy is certainly aware of this. Having achieved unexpected success in air attacks against Germany, they boasted that they were prepared to apply the same tactics to the Pacific War. In fact, the situation in Europe is completely different from that in the Pacific, so it will be difficult for Britain and the United States to achieve their wishes. However, it is necessary to review the tactics used by the enemy in Europe, especially today, when the European war has come to an end. It is expected that the first thing that will be transferred to the East Asian theater will be air power. Let us take a look at the situation of air combat in the European war, focusing on the United States.</p>
<h3>Peculiarities of the Japanese Paratrooper Corps</h3>
<p>The most peculiar characteristic of the Japanese paratrooper corps is its possession of the "Kamikaze" spirit, disregarding survival.</p>
<p>Paratroopers, landing far from friendly lines in enemy territory, are naturally unafraid of death; this is true for paratroopers of any nation. Japanese paratroopers are, of course, even more unafraid of death. They possess the so-called "divine soldier" spirit of not hesitating to die to see a mission through. However, sacrificing life is not the objective, but a means to accomplish the mission. When those who disregard life and death fight desperately, their achievement will naturally be the best possible result from human effort. After landing at the North and Central airfields under American occupation on Okinawa Island, until their valiant deaths, the Giretsu Airborne Unit would do its utmost to blow up enemy aircraft, destroy facilities, and kill personnel, using all ammunition carried to achieve the greatest possible results. Therefore, their achievements will be unprecedented and brilliant, and the damage inflicted on the enemy will not be limited to material and personnel; it is believed to be significant psychologically as well.</p>
<h3>Lessons of the European War: The Number of Enemy Air Forces</h3>
<p>The organized air raids by British and American forces against Germany only became truly significant around February of last year. At the beginning of that year, the enemy's air strength in Europe consisted of 5,700 American aircraft and 8,400 British aircraft, totaling 14,100. By the time of the landing in northern France, American aircraft had increased to 10,000, while British aircraft numbered 8,900, totaling 18,900 (the air strength concentrated in the British Isles alone amounted to 11,000), while the German side had only over 9,000. With such an overwhelming absolute advantage, the British and American invasion operations in Europe were able to unfold favorably. The British and American air forces conducted fierce bombing raids on German positions, railways, factories, airfields, and major cities in northern France and southwestern Germany, weakening German mobility. After half a year of such combat, they were able to break into the German mainland.</p>
<p>In the battles near the German-French border, the British and American air forces repeatedly used large formations of approximately one thousand bombers to carry out a kind of "carpet bombing," dropping large quantities of bombs all at once, destroying everything in the target area. Since this year, the bombing of Germany has intensified even further. It is said that around the time the British and American forces crossed the Rhine in March, they were deploying more than three thousand aircraft per day.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Enemy Air Forces</h3>
<p>The aircraft used in the bombing of Germany included American B-17s (Flying Fortresses) and B-24s (Liberators), while British forces recently used Lancaster bombers, all of which were four-engine heavy bombers. Among these, B-17s and B-24s also appeared frequently in the Greater East Asia War theater and became opponents of the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<p>The bombs used initially in the European war were around half a ton in weight, but by the end of last year, British Lancaster aircraft began using 6-ton "Ask Erk" bombs, and around the time of the Rhine crossing, they were using 11-ton "Vulcan" bombs to bomb transportation facilities and other strategic points. The payload capacity of Lancaster heavy bombers seems to be the largest today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, heavy fighter planes also carried small bombs to carry out bombing at high speeds. American P-38 formations also frequently attacked German ground troops.</p>
<p>As for the method of dropping bombs, they were not simply released to fall naturally under gravity, but also used rocket-assisted bombs, hoping to add artificial thrust to the gravitational force, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the bombs and achieving greater results. It is said that it was this type of rocket-assisted bomb that destroyed the thick walls of German submarine pens on the European coast. Thus, the application of rocket principles tends to become more widespread. In order to counter the German Messerschmitt jet fighters, the enemy announced that the United States was testing the Sikorsky jet aircraft, and Britain also had the De Havilland 2 jet aircraft, but these high-speed aircraft had not yet been practically applied in the European war.</p>
<h3>Enemy Air Strategy</h3>
<p>In the early days of military aircraft usage, the general strategic thinking regarding air power was to use a large-scale air force to strike the enemy's heartland in one fell swoop at the beginning of the war, in order to quickly end the war. The strategic theory advocated by Italian General Douhet during the previous Great War was of this type. However, this is an ideal scenario. In actual warfare, because the enemy also possesses a strong air force, it is necessary to first engage in a decisive air battle, defeat the opponent, and gain air supremacy before being able to bomb the enemy's center. The representative of this line of thinking is British General Groves. Therefore, the British Air Force devoted considerable effort to strengthening the fighter squadrons that were powerful elements in decisive air battles. This is why they were able to cope with the German Air Force's bombing of the British Isles after the fall of France, and why the British forces were able to achieve victory in the North African campaign. The American Air Force also adopted this strategy. Since January of last year, it has established joint air force organizations worldwide based on British top-tier air force strategy, dividing air units into tactical air forces and strategic air forces. Tactical air forces focus on destroying enemy air power and assisting ground operations, specifically attacking the enemy's existing military strength. Strategic air forces, on the other hand, focus on attacking enemy rear transportation facilities, munitions factories, major cities, and other wartime strategic points, i.e., potential war-making capabilities. In other words, the former aims at striking the enemy's existing military strength, while the latter threatens the potential war-making capabilities that are the source of that strength. The two support each other to consume the opponent's strength.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the effect of strategic bombing. According to Ralph K. Davis, Deputy Director of the U.S. Petroleum Administration for War, in a statement made in Washington on May 6, in the past year, British and American air forces carried out 270 air strikes on German oil refineries and other petroleum production facilities, dropping nearly 100,000 tons of bombs, causing a shortage of fuel for the German military. Their tanks and air forces were thus greatly impacted.</p>
<h3>The Destiny of Japan</h3>
<p>According to enemy propaganda, the material and human resources used by the enemy, the U.S., and Britain, in the war against Germany will be transferred to East Asia after the end of the war in Europe. This is not mere propaganda but an actual matter, and a predictable development. In particular, easily transportable aircraft and some of the air personnel could be deployed to the East Asian theater within a few weeks. This can be easily foreseen, considering the enemy's current losses.</p>
<p>Recently, according to a military expert's paper, due to shipping and distance relationships, the enemy forces that the U.S. and Britain could transport to the East Asian theater by April or May of next year would be approximately double the existing forces, or two million. However, these are only the forces that can be transferred to East Asia. As for troops with sufficient combat capability, due to shipping and port constraints, and difficulties in transporting military supplies, it would only be around 500,000 men. Based on this, it is too early to say that a landing operation on the Japanese mainland is impossible. Even a landing operation along the Chinese coast may not be as easy as the enemy claims. However, it would be premature to conclude from this that Japan is bound to win. The enemy, the U.S., and Britain will transfer many of the B-24s and other medium bombers used in the European strategic bombing campaign to the East Asian theater, using islands near the Japanese mainland such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa as bases, and intensify air operations, carrying out indiscriminate bombing of Japanese cities to weaken Japan's munitions production capacity and make it unable to resist. In addition, the enemy will adopt a strategy of isolating the Japanese mainland, deploying aircraft to drop mines and obstruct Japanese maritime transport. However, for Japan, securing islands near the mainland and the Chinese mainland is the most important factor for victory.</p>
<p>Securing all the land suitable for establishing air bases is a very large undertaking and difficult to achieve. Moreover, even if it is possible to occupy them and accumulate military supplies there, due to the activities of paratrooper units, aircraft can be used at any time to land in key enemy locations, so the possibility of recapturing or destroying them is high. The astonishing feat of the Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit this time, in this sense, can truly influence the East Asian war situation, and its results and impact are worthy of serious consideration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval General Headquarters</h3>
<p>The war on Okinawa Island is intensifying and finally facing the final decisive stage. Therefore, the Navy, in order to adapt to the war situation, is undertaking a major reform, namely, deciding to establish the Naval General Headquarters. The strength of the naval operational forces, including surface forces, air forces, special attack forces, and base combat forces, is an extremely complex organization. However, the significance of establishing the Naval General Headquarters lies in the unification of all naval forces and their effective command, taking charge of the various fleets under the Combined Fleet, the naval districts, naval stations, and all units and bases belonging to the guard districts, as well as the unified command of the main operational units under naval command. In the past, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, in fact, also took on this unified command, but now it is becoming a fixed system, which naturally has great significance.</p>
<p>The Combined Fleet has been a fixed form since the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Naval strength was, of course, limited to naval forces, but the current Greater East Asia War has changed the form of maritime operations, transforming them into air operations. As a result, the Combined Fleet has also finally changed its original form, holding fleet air power and base air power. Now, air power has become the main force in maritime operations. Therefore, the components that make up naval strength have become diverse.</p>
<p>At the same time, the battlefield has moved closer to the Japanese mainland, and the bases and units belonging to the naval districts and guard districts have become forces on the front line, participating in counter-enemy operations. In order to adapt to various situations, it is naturally necessary to implement effective unified command of all naval forces. The establishment of the Naval General Headquarters shows that the Navy is waiting for the Commander-in-Chief's decisive use of troops and the determination to annihilate and capture the enemy's naval forces.</p>
<p>It should be particularly pointed out that Admiral Toyoda, a highly respected figure in the Navy, is also serving as the first Commander-in-Chief, so the morale of all soldiers is becoming even more fervent. Therefore, we dare to say that due to this spirit of certain victory, a victorious outcome will be achieved. (Translated from the May 3 Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Enemy Air Power in the Pacific</h3>
<p>The function of air power in the Greater East Asia War has been discussed repeatedly, and there is almost nothing more to say. The sharpest edge of the Japanese Navy, with the naval air force as the vanguard, has launched battles to annihilate enemy naval forces everywhere. The enemy's main axis of island-hopping counter-offensive operations is air power. The decisive battle between Japan and the U.S. around the Japanese mainland will, of course, be conducted in the form of an air battle. The enemy claims that it will use the same methods against Japan that it used against Germany. Can it really do so? Let us examine it daily.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Bases</h3>
<p>When the British and American forces entered Europe, they had the British Isles as their base of operations. Unlike the British mainland, which is close to the European continent and can accommodate a large number of troops, the British and American forces have not yet been able to find a base of that kind around the Japanese mainland today. Currently, they only have the Mariana base for using B-29s. Relying solely on this, they cannot carry out effective large-scale attacks. Therefore, the U.S. military has no choice but to look at Okinawa, attempting to acquire that base in order to deploy the B-17s, B-24s, and other medium bombers used in Europe.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Supply</h3>
<p>To supply the Mariana bases, they must overcome the distance of nearly 10,000 kilometers from the U.S. mainland. The length of the supply line has an extremely negative impact on operational efficiency.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Aircraft Types</h3>
<p>If the aircraft types used in Europe cannot be quickly effective in the war against Japan, then they will have to rely on the B-29. According to the U.S., the monthly production of this large aircraft is only about 200, so it is questionable whether they can launch an aggressive offensive with this. Moreover, even if the air raids are effective, the damage rate is also extremely high.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Strategy</h3>
<p>The enemy uses B-29s from the Mariana bases to carry out strategic bombing while using naval air power to destroy Japan's existing military strength. That is, the air power from aircraft carriers takes on the role of tactical air forces in the European war. This creates great difficulties in command and control, and also carries the risk of encountering enormous attrition.</p>
<h3>Air Strategic Posture</h3>
<p>The enemy forces attempting to approach the Japanese mainland through air operations face many difficulties, as mentioned above. However, the enemy's position forces it to take on these risks and carry out operations. In the face of such a situation, what about Japan's counter-attack? We know that what is unfavorable to the enemy is favorable to Japan. These are listed below:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese mainland is a vast group of air bases. Today, every place and every corner of the Japanese mainland has been strengthened with air bases and has been completely transformed into an air fortress.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's supply is free and unimpeded. Due to the dispersed deployment of the munitions industry, each part of the Japanese mainland can be self-sufficient, and moreover, behind it are the vast reserve resources of Manchuria and China.</p>
<p>Third, because Japan has adopted a strategy of luring the enemy deep, it does not need to produce a large number of large aircraft like the enemy, but can use small aircraft to achieve the greatest effect. Moreover, the Japanese munitions industry technology is extremely excellent and is able to manufacture good bombs and torpedoes that are far superior to enemy bombs, building great achievements. The enemy's large bombs are not at all fearful.</p>
<p>Fourth, with the above strategic elements as the background, the Japanese military's air tactics are flexible, and the morale of the Japanese military is also soaring. They will surely kill any approaching enemy without leaving them a scrap of armor. The Japanese special attack forces are the flower of these tactics. As for their power, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz praised Japan when he inspected Okinawa in April, saying, "If the special attack forces fly in, we will eventually suffer terrible damage!"</p>
<p>From the above points, the enemy's use of forces from the European theater in the Pacific theater is nothing to be afraid of. Even if they can draw out the remaining 10,000 aircraft, in the fast-paced air war, no effect can be expected. The only thing that can cast a shadow on Japan's air strategic posture, which is sure to win, is the enemy's strategic bombing, which destroys Japan's potential power. However, the Japanese people are now displaying their worth, vigorously replenishing their fighting power under the air raids, and will sink any enemy that attacks in the future to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. When the enemy's human and material resources are exhausted, the good opportunity for victory will naturally come.</p>
<h3>Brilliant Achievements: The Japanese Navy in the Past Year</h3>
<p>In the past year, the development of the Greater East Asia War has been astonishing. The Japanese Navy, in fierce operations, with the special attack forces as the backbone, has repeatedly inflicted extremely heavy damage on the attacking U.S. mobile force. The most famous of these are the following: The Battle of the Mariana Islands, the Battle of Peleliu Island, the Great Air Battle off Taiwan, the Great Air and Sea Battle in the East Sea of the Philippines, the Great Battle of Lingayen Gulf, the Great Battle of Iwo Jima, and the Great Battles off the Southeast Sea of Kyushu and near Okinawa Island.</p>
<p>These seven major battles are the highlights. In each battle, the Japanese naval and air forces cooperated with the army on the islands to carry out fierce fighting tactics. The sacrificial spirit of the special attack forces, with the slogan of "one plane for one ship", caused the enemy mobile forces to suffer enormous losses each time. Nimitz's Third Fleet's Fifth Task Force was shattered and decimated, and it was impossible to replenish it in time.</p>
<p>The details of each major battle in the past year are described separately below:</p>
<p>One. The Battle of the Mariana Islands. June 20 of last year: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that enemy forces attacking Saipan Island had seized a corner of the island on the afternoon of June 15 and were gradually increasing their strength. The Japanese garrison forces constantly engaged them, inflicting heavy damage. The enemy appearing near the Mariana Islands was a large mobile force mainly composed of aircraft carriers and battleships. The enemy has now concentrated most of the Pacific Fleet in that area. The Japanese air force is attacking the enemy mobile force every day. From June 12 to June 20, the Japanese gains were as follows: A. Sunk one enemy battleship, two cruisers, one destroyer, and one submarine. B. Destroyed four or more enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, eight transports, and one ship of unknown type. C. Shot down more than 300 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>On June 24 of last year, Rear Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, Minister of the Navy, gave a speech on the victory in the Mariana Sea Battle, saying that the people of our country must not stand idly by, and that the Japanese would rely on superior air power to inflict major damage on the enemy ships that come to challenge them.</p>
<p>On July 1, after the Battle of the Mariana Islands, the enemy mobile forces advanced to the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima. The Japanese military fought with them, with the following results: The Japanese forces sank two enemy aircraft carriers and two ships of unknown types in the south of the Ogasawara Islands on June 24, and shot down more than 55 enemy aircraft. In Saipan Island and the nearby sea, from June to July, the results were as follows: Sunk one enemy battleship, two cruisers, two destroyers, and two transport ships; destroyed two aircraft carriers, two destroyers, and five transport ships; and shot down 211 enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Two. The Battle of Peleliu Island</h3>
<p>On July 17, Navy Minister Shigetarō Shimada resigned and was succeeded by Vice Admiral Naokuni Nomura, First Class, Third Order of Merit.</p>
<p>After the Battle of the Mariana Islands, there were fierce battles in Palau. Before that, there were battles on Guam Island and Tinian Island.</p>
<p>July 26: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that enemy forces landed on Tinian Island on July 23, and on July 24, enemy forces landed on Guam Island, both of which were repelled by the Japanese garrison. The fighting on both islands lasted for two months, and the Japanese military never stopped resisting.</p>
<p>On September 22, fighting broke out between Palau and Yap Islands. On one day, more than 100 enemy aircraft were shot down, and there was also fierce fighting on Peleliu Island.</p>
<p>On October 6, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the results of the battle on Palau Island as follows: Since the enemy landed on Peleliu Island on September 15, the enemy has suffered more than 18,000 casualties; more than 90 tanks have been hit and caught fire or run aground; 13 enemy artillery pieces have been destroyed; one cruiser, two destroyers, one submarine, one minesweeper, and one ship of unknown type have been sunk; and one submarine, one minesweeper, and two ships of unknown type, as well as 62 landing craft, have been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Three. The Great Air Battle off Taiwan</h3>
<p>The fighting on the Palau Islands was not yet over when the Great Air Battle off Taiwan took place in mid-October, followed by the fiercest air and sea battle since the Greater East Asia War, which unfolded in the four regions of the Philippines.</p>
<p>On October 12, superior enemy aircraft attacked Taiwan. By around 3 p.m., approximately 100 enemy aircraft had been shot down. At the same time, the Japanese air force attacked the enemy mobile forces on the eastern sea off Taiwan on the night of the 12th, repeatedly attacking through the night, sinking one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type, and destroying one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type.</p>
<p>On October 13, the enemy forces in the sea off Taiwan were completely routed, and the great achievements of the Japanese military included the destruction of more than 40 enemy ships, including: Sinking 10 aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 3 cruisers, and 1 destroyer; and destroying 3 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, 4 cruisers, and 11 ships of unknown type.</p>
<p>The Great Air and Sea Battle off the East Sea of Taiwan was the prelude to the Great Battle of the Philippines.</p>
<h3>IV. Naval Battles off the Philippine Islands</h3>
<p>The great air and sea battle near the Philippines began on October 15th. By the 25th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the following battle results: Sunk - 4 aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers, 1 destroyer, and more than 4 transport ships; Damaged - 2 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, and 2 cruisers.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the change in weather on October 22nd, the enemy American forces landed on Leyte Island at East Cape in the Philippines, and their warships invaded Leyte Gulf. Consequently, the largest and decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War unfolded continuously within this gulf. Japanese special attack units repeatedly launched attacks, inflicting significant damage on enemy warships.</p>
<p>On October 28th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced two war reports, detailing the great battle results in Leyte Gulf and the eastern sea off the Philippines, which, when combined with the previous results in the sea off Taiwan and the eastern sea, yielded the following remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>Sunk: 19 aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 6 cruisers, 3 destroyers, 4 transport ships.</p>
<p>Damaged: 15 aircraft carriers, 3 battleships, 6 cruisers, 4 destroyers, 4 transport ships, and 12 ships of unidentified type. In total, 72 enemy ships were sunk or damaged.</p>
<p>Additionally, within Leyte Gulf, approximately 108 enemy landing craft and small vessels were separately sunk or damaged.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Japanese special attack force launched attacks on the enemy fleet in the eastern sea off the Philippines on October 25th, inflicting damage or sinking on 35 enemy ships between the 25th and 30th. 500 enemy aircraft were shot down. On November 1st, the "Kamikaze" (Divine Wind) squadron attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf, destroying and sinking 10 enemy battleships and other vessels in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Therefore, the turbulent waves of the Pacific Ocean have caused the enemy American fleet to tremble at the power of the Japanese Kamikaze squadrons. Their losses, up to November 2nd, included 88 enemy ships sunk and 121 damaged, totaling 209 ships.</p>
<p>On November 8th, the Japanese Army and Navy separately announced the commanders for the Philippine Islands area. General Tomoyuki Yamashita was appointed as the highest commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Tsunayoshi Uemura as the commander of the Army Air Force, Admiral Denhichi Okochi as the highest commander of the Navy, and Vice Admirals Fukudome Shigeru and Onishi Takijiro as commanders of the Naval Air Force.</p>
<p>On November 10th, Rear Admiral Kondo, the naval attaché in Shanghai, was ordered to transfer to the Naval General Staff on the 7th. His successor, Rear Admiral Minato Yuzuru, officially took office on the 10th and delivered a speech.</p>
<p>The battles in the Philippines progressed under extreme tension. The Japanese special attack units bombed enemy ships in Leyte Gulf, and major battles occurred in the seas off Mindanao and both the east and west coasts of Luzon. On land, enemy troops fought fiercely with Japanese forces on Leyte Island, resulting in a stalemate for more than two months. On December 16th, enemy ships passed the southern tip of the Philippines and entered the western sea off the Philippines, landing on Mindoro Island, but still provided opportunities for Japan to inflict losses on enemy strength. Between December 13th and 15th, 25 enemy ships were sunk or damaged, and between December 20th and 23rd, 22 ships were sunk or damaged. Leyte Gulf, Ormoc Bay, and Mindoro became graveyards for the enemy.</p>
<p>The Kamikaze special attack units again struck enemy ships off the coast of Mindanao between December 28th and 29th, destroying 17 enemy ships. On January 3rd of this year, they also bombed and destroyed 5 enemy ships.</p>
<p>At this time, the enemy's operations against the Philippines shifted from Leyte and Mindoro to a full-scale battle for Luzon Island. This was the focus of the decisive battle in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>V. Great Naval Battle of Lingayen Gulf</h3>
<p>From January 3rd to 5th of this year, enemy aircraft first carried out air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa, retreating after losing 25 aircraft.</p>
<p>On January 7th, enemy fleets appeared outside Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island and lingered outside Manila Bay. They were attacked by Japanese air units, and more than 30 ships were sunk. The enemy's landing operation in Lingayen Gulf on Luzon was carried out daringly on January 9th. Since then, Lingayen Gulf has become the second Leyte Gulf, with enemy ships being bombed and sunk daily. By January 12th, enemy ship losses had reached 121.</p>
<p>The enemy forces landing in Lingayen Gulf remained within a small area, suffering more than 6,000 casualties by the 20th without making progress. According to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on February 2nd, the enemy forces landing in Lingayen had suffered 11,200 casualties. Another part of the enemy fleet entered Manila Bay on January 29th and suffered a fierce attack.</p>
<p>By mid-February, the Philippine operations were suppressed by the enemy's superior strength. The Japanese defenders adopted a war of attrition strategy and withdrew from Manila. General Yamashita established a base in the mountains northeast of Manila and continued fighting, which continues to this day. The next major battle unfolded at Iwo Jima.</p>
<h3>VI. Great Naval Battle of Iwo Jima</h3>
<p>On February 17th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that enemy forces attempted to land on Iwo Jima under heavy shelling, but each attempt was repelled by the Japanese defenders. Simultaneously, the Japanese air force launched fierce attacks around Iwo Jima, sinking 8 enemy ships. This marked the beginning of the Battle of Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>On February 19th, the enemy began landing on Iwo Jima. This heroic war lasted more than 30 days. During the intense battles, the Kamikaze special attack units also joined the fighting. From the 16th to the 22nd, the enemy ships sunk or damaged, according to the Imperial Headquarters, reached 29. By the end of February, this number had increased to more than 50. At the same time, the casualties among the enemy forces landing on the island reached 13,500 by the end of February and had accumulated to more than 20,000 by March 7th. The fact that the enemy had to pay such a price for the area of Iwo Jima, which only measured nine square miles, also demonstrates the loyalty, courage, and sacrifice of the Japanese defenders. On March 16th, the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima declared glorious martyrdom, while the enemy's deaths and injuries totaled approximately 25,800. The heroic name of Lieutenant General Kuribayashi, the commander of the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, will be eternally remembered.</p>
<h3>VII. Battles Southeast of Kyushu and Okinawa</h3>
<p>After Iwo Jima, the decisive battle for Okinawa Island soon began. From March 18th to 23rd, the enemy first appeared with a mobile force in the seas southeast of Kyushu, attempting to disrupt the defense of the Japanese mainland. The Japanese forces, responsible for the heavy task of defending the homeland, met them head-on, sinking 5 enemy fleet carriers, 1 battleship, 5 cruisers, and 1 other ship in five days. The enemy mobile force then retreated southward in disarray.</p>
<p>On March 25th, the enemy mobile force appeared in the seas off Okinawa Island, and part of their forces landed on Kerama Islands. Thus began the ongoing battle for the Ryukyu Islands. From the 26th to the 29th, enemy ships off Okinawa were sunk or damaged. By April 2nd, 177 enemy ships had been sunk in the seas off Okinawa. Subsequently, on April 8th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the sinking or damaging of another 48 enemy ships, indicating that the enemy's losses were even more severe. According to a consolidated report on the 16th, the enemy ships sunk or damaged around Okinawa had reached 393. If the results of the past month were added, the enemy ships sunk or damaged near Okinawa were at least 400 or more.</p>
<p>To date, Okinawa Island is still being firmly defended by Japanese forces. The further the enemy penetrates into the heart of the Japanese defense line, the greater their losses will be, it can be stated.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Looking at the overall war situation over the past year, the enemy has lost over 1,000 ships, with casualties exceeding 100,000. With the conviction of certain victory, and under the great mission of protecting the homeland, the Japanese Navy is organizing a decisive battle fleet with its elite forces. Under the guidance of Field Marshal Suzuki, the new Prime Minister and Admiral of the Navy, and Navy Minister Admiral Yonai, full preparations are being made.</p>
<p>On May 1st, the Imperial Japanese Navy established a Naval General Headquarters to respond to modern warfare, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda was specially appointed as the first Naval Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>It is believed that the Japanese naval lineup will become even more solid. Under the leadership of Admiral Toyoda, the entire army is determined to reduce the enemy to the last man, and fight for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>As we celebrate the 40th Japanese Navy Day, we look back on the evolution of the war over the past year and have boundless expectations for the strong navy of our allies.</p>
<h3>Sketches from the Home Front: The Kanagawa Prefecture Naval Clothing Factory</h3>
<p>There is a saying now that "the home front is also a battlefield." Just looking at the Kanagawa Prefecture Naval Clothing Factory makes it clear that it is indeed a "battlefield." The female workers there put their entire spirit into their work, even adding an extra stitch to each item and sending as many items as possible to the front lines for the soldiers to wear. The owner of a certain textile company who had previously competed with the world in factory management and production was amazed by this situation, believing that in his past twenty years of work, he had never seen such labor enthusiasm. On this home front battlefield, most of the remarkable achievements were achieved by young women under the age of twenty. Even in aircraft factories, 70-80% of the wartime workers were women. Clothing factories were completely "women's factories."</p>
<p>In the cutting room, they fold fifty layers of cloth, place a template on top, and use electric shears to cut. They continuously cut on a thirty-six-meter-long table, perhaps the only place like this in the country. A fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl grabs one end of the cloth and runs to the side of the table, and a female technician pulls the cloth so that it falls neatly into a box. The girl always runs back and forth. She has to run one hundred and sixty times a day, back and forth totaling three hundred and twenty times. What arduous work!</p>
<p>The fabric room is filled with countless light green rolls of cloth. One by one, they are carried to the cutting room. Hundreds of sewing machines are arranged in rows. They start work at 8:00 AM and stop at 5:30 PM, with two twenty-minute breaks in the morning and afternoon, and a forty-minute lunch break. Aside from that, it is 100% working time. There is a flower hanging on each pillar, which distinguishes it as a "women's factory." There are also many slogans, such as "Work diligently!" To outsiders, the enthusiastic work ethic seems like madness. In ordinary factories, the foreman is simply a supervisor, but in this factory, she is just another worker. If the materials are late, a scolding is heard: "Foreman, hurry up!" Fifteen and sixteen-year-old girls use irons that seem too heavy for them, working nimbly. Even a strong man would be tired after working like that for thirty minutes straight.</p>
<p>Those with weaker bodies work in the cap-making room, but even there they produce four times more than in an ordinary factory. Each female worker wants to sew an extra stitch and make an extra item for the soldiers on the front lines. Because of this labor enthusiasm, they are overjoyed when they complete a lot of work. Sometimes, they are so excited that they cannot sleep at night. The factory's attendance rate is actually "98.93%," with only 1.07% being absent, and this number is entirely due to illness.</p>
<p>Koun Dormitory, Shiran Dormitory, these are the names of their dormitories. Their dormitories are completely naval style, just like the living quarters of naval students. On the blackboard in the dormitory, a large motto is written: "No matter how much knowledge you have, if you are not virtuous and brave, you are nothing. Our lives are about courage." (From the Asahi Newspaper, May 23rd)</p>
<h3>Visiting the Anti-Submarine School</h3>
<p>"Modern warfare" can be called a complete "replenishment war." The greater the increased production of aircraft, the greater the responsibility of escort ships, anti-submarine vessels, and transport ships to protect the sea lanes connecting resource areas and the homeland. It is only natural that enemy submarines will try to disrupt these communication lines. In this intense replenishment war, graduating officer candidates are now carrying the expectations of the entire nation on their shoulders and fighting hard. The reporter visited the Anti-Submarine School and saw the candidates training silently and relentlessly, preparing to dedicate themselves to this intense replenishment war. The reporter sincerely hopes that these candidates will make endless achievements in the "replenishment war sea."</p>
<p>The "Anti-Submarine School" was already respected in its past incarnation as the Torpedo School. This school uses sonar and hydroacoustic devices to detect enemy submarines. Warships launch depth charges, and aircraft assist from the side. This war of attacking submarines from the air and sea has changed the past. In 1944, it was renamed the "Anti-Submarine School," and everything was reorganized and adjusted to meet the needs of the nation.</p>
<p>The candidates who graduated from this school are already active on the front lines of the anti-submarine war. However, the situation is becoming more urgent every day, and more general student participation is naturally desired. The situation now requires students to go to the front lines immediately, fighting alongside the soldiers. This is a feeling that I strongly had.</p>
<p>A certain lieutenant (graduate of Tokyo Imperial University) who returned from the front lines to become an instructor at his alma mater moved me greatly with his words. The replenishment war, which decides victory or defeat, requires even more dedication to sea defense, anti-submarine warfare, and other anti-submarine operations than ever before. For the core personnel, it is required to learn quickly, which depends on how hard the students work. The first half of the training period for officer candidates mainly covers navigation, gunnery, communication, aeronautics, short boat land warfare, swordsmanship, and bayonet practice; the second half focuses on technical subjects such as underwater measurement, navigation, anti-submarine operations, and maritime escort. The emphasis is on understanding the soul of anti-submarine operations, depth judgment, and depth charge warfare. Most of the instructors who live with the students are graduates of the school.</p>
<p>These young officers are all soldiers who have come back after fighting through gunfire. After waking up at 6:00 AM, they offer a distant bow to the heavens. The schedule includes morning exercises (gymnastics, running, one hour of self-study), three hours of classes in the morning, lunch, and three hours of classes in the afternoon. This is how the students at the school are trained. At that time, I was listening to the experiences of Lieutenant S (graduate of Ryogoku Higher Marine School).</p>
<p>Lieutenant S's escort vessel protected a transport ship and continued towards XXX. After sailing for several nights, the transport ship reached its destination. At that time, two snow-white water mine traces came directly towards the transport ship. The sun was still high, this was a daylight attack, looking down on the Japanese escort ship. Lieutenant S was beside himself with anger, he said, “Damn it!" Then the escort ship followed the traces of the water mines, at full throttle to find the enemy. In a flash, oil covered the surface of the sea, a moth drawn to the flame! S Lieutenant felt extremely happy.</p>
<p>When they heard about the achievements of their elders, the students worked even harder in their physical training and academic studies. When they heard about the sacrifices of their elders during submarine attacks, the students shed tears for the fallen heroes and vowed revenge.</p>
<p>"When we protect the transport fleet and complete our mission safely, countless classmates come to greet us at the harbor. After a brief greeting, we start talking about our respective battles, at this time, it can be said is the most enjoyable part. However, sometimes we do not see our comrades' faces at the port. At that time, we....</p>
<h3>Naval Engineering School</h3>
<p>As I approached the student hall, the large clock between the windows of its three stories struck 11:50 AM. Students in white uniforms were running. The "First Classmen," wearing battle caps, were constantly loudly scolding the "First and Second Classmen," wearing military caps, and the "Third Classmen." For some reason, the sound of leather boots echoed loudly on the wooden corridor, making it very lively. The chaotic and lively scene left one speechless. At that time, Lieutenant Commander Yamamoto, who was leading the tour, said:</p>
<h3>Disciplined Extracurricular Life</h3>
<p>"Running is a daily routine, and you are not allowed to walk slowly. Movements within a warship must strive to take place as fast as possible, so one must be strictly trained in peacetime. However, it is not like this at all times. In the classroom or self-study room, one must be calm and relaxed. You will see this later, and you will find that it is as quiet as in a forest. Look, they move quickly and silently. In fact, they are not allowed to chat when they are doing things, whether it is cleaning or polishing shoes. They are all silent."</p>
<p>"At 12 o'clock, everyone gathers in the cafeteria for lunch, but the entire gathering takes place only five minutes beforehand. The last five minutes are certainly important, but the first five minutes are even more important in the Navy. No matter what task, one must be in a standby posture five minutes beforehand. On the surface, it may seem unimportant, but in reality, it is related to the whole. Rising in time is essential in a fleet battle. To put it more simply, it is the spirit of the first shot hitting the target." "It felt like being shocked by electricity." "Perhaps I was killed by an enemy submarine." When we learn of the unfortunate incident, we sit on the ground and cry uncontrollably. Then we shout loudly, "Students in the mainland, put down your pens and join the war!"</p>
<p>The above are the words of Lieutenant A (graduate of Tokyo Imperial University). The main characteristic of the school is that the entire faculty and students are like one family.</p>
<p>"The students regard us teachers as older brothers. We treat the students as younger brothers. I have never seen such a good phenomenon during my student days. Even our private lives are discussed with our superiors. For example, we seek their opinions on marriage. This kind of thing is like sitting on a small warship and executing a special mission against enemy submarines. We develop a close relationship."</p>
<p>This was a naval life that Lieutenant B (graduate of Keio University) had never imagined before entering the school. He felt that the atmosphere of the Anti-Submarine School was very good. When the officer candidates complete their period of study, the indomitable fighting spirit they have cultivated is enough to protect transport fleets day and night without sleep or food, completing their missions. These young officers already have the patience of iron and stone, showing a majestic spirit on escort ships, anti-submarine vessels, and minesweepers. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun) To put it more simply, it is the spirit of the first shot hitting the target."</p>
<p>At the entrance of the student hall, there are four pillars, which mark the crossroads of the corridor. The students were moving quickly. We stood there for a moment. Soon, the lieutenant commander suddenly smiled:</p>
<p>"Did you notice? Look, none of the students are walking outside the pillars, they are all passing through the four pillars. This is not because there are any rules or instructions requiring them to do so. Among the students, there has long been, ever since I was a student, such an unwritten rule: An Imperial soldier does not take shortcuts, but walks straight with dignity. Senior students often tell junior students this. As a result, it has created the unique culture of this school."</p>
<p>After lunch, there is a break until 2:00 PM. The students appear in the square, each squadron doing what they wish. The sunlight occasionally breaks through the dense clouds, brightening the drill ground surrounded by pine and camphor trees. Look, there is a mounted combat game, and on this side, they are playing baseball, gliding, and driving cars. Some students are even playing cat and mouse games. It is said that they do not wash clothes on good days, because they can hand the washed clothes to the drying facility, and they will dry them immediately, regardless of whether it is rainy or sunny. Even more interesting is that on snowy days, they pile up snow to create fortresses and play snow-covered base defense games. The situation is very passionate and tragic, and sometimes they really get into fights that result in head injuries, leaving patches of blood on the white snow. "Tenacity" is the first goal of this school's education. Kendo and other combat skills also aim to cultivate a spirit of confrontation, with etiquette being of secondary importance.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Fighting to the End</h3>
<p>Entering the school gate, on the left side of the auditorium, there is a road along the mountain. Climbing about a hundred steps along this road leads to the top. This small hill is called Azalea Hill. It is the sacred place of the school. At the top, there is a shrine dedicated to the Great Goddess Amaterasu, and not far from the jade railing, there is a bust, a stern-looking student statue, placed high on a granite rectangular column base about two meters high. This is the statue of Okubo Teiin, a student of the first year. He was originally unfamiliar with the water. Four months after entering the school, he finally learned to swim. In a swimming competition, he volunteered to participate in a long-distance swim, striving to the end, and finally became a "guest of no return" four or five hundred meters from the finish line. He is the best symbol of the school's spirit of tenacity. Hidden within the strict training is the determined spirit of the faculty and students' hard work and effort. Today, if students have any unusual behavior, they are ordered to visit the statue, or they voluntarily run to the statue to reflect and repent.</p>
<h3>The Source of Naval Science</h3>
<p>"Naval Academy, Engineering Academy, and Accounting Academy are all places for cultivating naval officers, the source of naval science, and the training ground for cadres who can apply science to gain victory in war. They are also the supply department for technical officers who will bring glory to the nation." Indeed, its equipment can be described as perfect. For example, in the physics classroom, there are no fewer than fifty or sixty types of gears, and each part of the ship's machinery is carefully divided, with a cut-open boiler, so that people can understand its complex structure at a glance. Each subject, from basic to practical training, from practical training to application, ensures that every student can apply what they have learned upon leaving the school, rather than engaging in closed-door theorizing. Therefore, every instructor is conscientious and does not merely impart knowledge. Japanese naval officers are cultivated in such sincere and passionate education. All students live in the school, and get up together at six o'clock in the morning when the sky is still dark. In this way, they cultivate a personality of consistent learning and action, a personality that can not only operate machinery, but also control the people who operate it. This is the demeanor of an officer.</p>
<h3>Naval Accounting Academy</h3>
<p>The early spring sunshine shines through the large glass windows, overlooking the courtyard below, with the clear sky of Tokyo and the surface of the Sumida River as the backdrop. In the courtyard, a team of students with bare upper bodies are doing exercises. Although it is early spring, the remnants of the accumulated snow remain in the shady areas. However, these young people seem to have forgotten the cold.</p>
<p>Across the courtyard, another team of students runs out of the school building, lines up in the courtyard, takes off their black caps with yellow trim, unbuttons their short jackets, removes their white shirts, and joins the exercises. From running out of the school building to the exercise field, including the time to undress, takes less than a minute, showing their agility. The one issuing commands and leading the exercises is one of the students.</p>
<p>The short jackets they take off are the uniforms of the students of the Naval Accounting Academy. This school, like the Naval Academy and the Engineering Academy, is a place for training Japanese naval officers. The gate of the school building is adorned with a brilliant chrysanthemum crest. Among these three schools, each boasting superior tradition and none willing to be outdone by the others, the entrance examination of the Naval Accounting Academy is considered somewhat unparalleled.</p>
<p>Because the school's name is Naval Accounting Academy, people may generally think that the students are just figures who wear visors and calculate money with abacuses. In the past, I thought so too.</p>
<p>"Those who believe that only officers and soldiers of the combat arms directly engaged in combat on the front lines are the flower of the military may think that the accounting corps is slightly inferior, but this is a big mistake. Because not only do they advance and retreat with the combat arms in actual warfare, but there is no difference from other combat arms schools in terms of school training and academic education. Moreover, the Naval Academy, Engineering Academy, and Accounting Academy stand as a tripod, jointly sharing the operation of the Navy. Now, please look at the student education schedule." Instructor ╳ Lieutenant Commander pointed to the student education schedule posted on the screen behind him. It is roughly as follows:</p>
<h3>What is the Soul of an Engineering Officer</h3>
<p>"What is the soul of an engineering officer?" I often asked this question. I received the following answer:</p>
<p>"A certain warship was bombed, its speed greatly reduced, and flames gradually spread. Finally, the entire ship had to be abandoned. At this time, a reporter ran to the engine room to inform them, but the squad leader replied, 'Never mind, bring me a cigarette first! This is where I die.' No matter how they persuaded him, he refused to escape, and the reporter had no choice but to leave. By the time they brought the cigarette, the fire was already very large, and they had to use the speaking tube for the final contact, but they heard the squad leader singing loudly, a drunken revelry song! Moreover, the lights there remained on until the ship sank into the waves. We didn't care how much we were bombed, or how much the ship was shaking. We didn't want to come out and watch the enemy planes, and we couldn't leave our posts. Everyone calmly did their job, prepared to die in their positions, and no one was willing to leave their positions to escape death. The engine room is below the armor line of the warship. If a bomb falls near the ventilation pipes, air cannot enter. There is also the possibility of steam pipes being damaged and leaking steam, and gas escaping. In such a situation, if there is no way to remedy it, all the workers in the engine room will lose their lives. However, if the steam is stopped, the warship cannot move, making it easier for enemy planes to attack. How many squad leaders have been trapped in this situation! And the heroic and decisive spirit of resolutely deploying everything and deciding not to die in vain is the expression of the leader's demeanor, and also the expression of pure sincerity. This is the symbol of the soul of an engineering officer." (Translated from Weekly Asahi, Volume 45, Issue 12)</p>
<p>Spiritual education includes several courses such as Imperial Rescript reading, interpretation, and exhortation. Training is divided into two categories: drill and work, including thirteen courses such as land warfare, short boat, signal, deployment drill, winter practice, cold resistance training, shipboard practice, camping, swimming training, field exercise, parade, sailing training, long rowing, and marching.</p>
<p>There are ten courses of duty including daily work and various inspections. Physical education includes various martial arts, sports, and physical skills in martial arts, gymnastics, and physical techniques. In this education, can you smell the stench of the accounting corps? Not at all!</p>
<p>In terms of academic education, they are all specialized subjects. As seen in the table above, there are a total of forty-three subjects under the three major categories of military science, basic science, and general science. The instructors are recruited from experts in various fields other than naval professors. As for martial arts, masters in the field guide them, with the goal of having all students possess standard martial arts qualifications. Every day, after waking up at 5:30 am in the summer and 6:00 am in the winter, until the inspection at 9:40 pm, there is not a minute wasted. Looking at the weekly schedule, there are ten major hours every day of the week, with no so-called holidays. And how they are used can multiply their effectiveness.</p>
<p>"When they first enter the school, many students regret why they had to enter such a busy school. We had such feelings when we were students. But after a month, they get used to it and can even find leisure in it," said Instructor ╳ Lieutenant Commander. He also pointed to the graduation photo hanging on the wall and said:</p>
<p>"This is me."</p>
<p>"Haha, the down hasn't dried yet!" Instructor 〇 teased from the side.</p>
<p>Students' grades are referred to as the nth class student according to the order of their entry into the school, or as the nth grade student based on the distinction of the academic year, but among students, they are usually called No. 1 student, No. 2 student, etc., starting from the highest grade. The students' academic education is organized by academic year, with a class leader and assistant leader system. Daily training and living are organized into squads by grade, with students from the highest grade serving as squad leaders under the command of the squad supervisors, guiding the squad members. ╳ Lieutenant Commander is the squad supervisor. Squad supervisors are instructors who are directly responsible for training and handle personnel and other matters of the squad members. This mixed squad system of each academic year is the basis of the Naval Accounting Academy student life and a common feature of the three naval schools. In addition, there is a weekly student system, where students from the highest grade take turns to maintain the military discipline and decorum of the student corps and assist in the implementation of daily routines and tasks. The weekly students and the squad leaders maintain close horizontal and vertical communication, and are responsible for autonomous training in the capacity of older brothers. Therefore, the direct leaders in the school are the squad leaders and the weekly students. This is the key to monitoring. The brotherhood established by students of the same class lasts a lifetime, and their relationship can even extend to their future families.</p>
<p>The time for classes arrived, and I went to visit their classrooms.</p>
<p>In the classroom for general engineering, a professor in an ordinary suit was drawing diagrams on the blackboard, lecturing on the use of brakes. On the desks, each student had a cannon-like working tool. Indeed, such a lesson requires such things.</p>
<p>In the accounting classroom, students were practicing recording money transactions. In another room, an instructor in civilian clothes was holding a large paper scroll model, explaining its meaning; this was the language classroom. Next to the English classroom, there was a model of a warship on the podium. An instructor in uniform stood in front of a map, explaining the structure of the warship.</p>
<p>Speaking of warships, the students' campus life is entirely based on the life of warship duty. When they graduate, they are naval accounting ensign candidates, and after one year of practice on a training fleet and a joint fleet, they become qualified naval accounting officers. However, even as accounting officers, if they are excluded from ship duty, their naval life is equivalent to zero. The mission of an accounting officer is to manage the manpower and material resources that are the source of military power, and to prepare and enrich the war effort. Whether their use is appropriate or not can immediately affect combat effectiveness. This is clearly stated in the student service guidelines, so the importance of the task is connected to the spirit of serving on ships.</p>
<p>"Neat and clear accounts, a spirit of sure victory, so as not to shame those on board the ship." According to Instructor ╳, this is the slogan of ship duty.</p>
<p>Turning down the long corridor, while descending the stairs, I unconsciously reached the front of the bathroom. Peeking inside, steam was rising from the cracks in the lid of the large bathtub, which was very refreshing.</p>
<p>From 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, it was time for physical education. Today, there was said to be judo instruction by Mifune Tenth Dan and kendo instruction by Nakayama Sensei, but I wanted to observe rowing.</p>
<p>The short boat is a small speedboat with twelve oars. The rowers were wearing white work clothes, with their hat straps fastened, and were commanded by the student squad leader.</p>
<p>"Right turn!" "No. 6, don't bend your upper body inward!"</p>
<p>Following the student squad leader's commands and guidance, the twelve oars rose and fell, like wings skimming over the water. After fifty minutes of vigorous rowing, they returned to the boathouse under the courtyard.</p>
<p>Dinner ended at 5:00 pm, and self-study began at 6:00 pm. During the three hours of quiet study time, there was a 10-minute break. During the break, there was a sweet treat to eat twice a week. If a student happened to be born on that day, everyone would express their congratulations to him. This day happened to be a day when sweet treats were distributed according to regulations. On the tables in the cafeteria, there were two sweet buns per plate, and the same on the instructors' tables. The student supervisor stood on a high place and asked loudly: "Who was born today?" Then a student who was born on that day stood up, stated his birthplace and experience, and then gave his thoughts and aspirations. At the end of the speech, a student representative gave a congratulatory speech, and everyone applauded like thunder.</p>
<p>"Does anyone have an entertainment program? Military songs, gymnastics are all fine. Don't be shy, or Instructor K will do it!"</p>
<p>"I do, I can sing the love [unclear] marching song in various languages."</p>
<p>The military song was sung very well, it could be said to have reached a high level.</p>
<p>In such a [unclear] and harmonious atmosphere, the [unclear] minutes slipped away unconsciously.</p>
<p>Instructor × said when he went to the instructor's office:</p>
<p>"One day's hard work can be eliminated in this way. In fact, although this is called a school, it is no different from the military, so everything must be done in accordance with military [unclear], and everyone must act with one heart. At first, when they came in, they thought it was a school, and only felt constrained and suppressed, and thought it was bitter. Later, they slowly realized what military discipline is, and became aware of their own calling, and [unclear] gradually [unclear] into military spirit and personality.</p>
<p>"However, since this place is called the Accounting Academy, acquiring the necessary [unclear] skills is, of course, as fundamental as becoming a soldier. In today's world of complete [unclear] aerial warfare, the supply of manpower and material resources is most important, so in order to achieve this goal, we must use all our efforts to train talents.</p>
<p>"The Accounting Academy was once considered the most [unclear] school to enter, but this was only a phenomenon when the number of admissions was small in the past. Now, there is a great need to increase the number of accounting corps officers, so this school is no longer the first [unclear] barrier. This school welcomes young people who are [unclear] ambitious and sincerely dedicated to serving the country."</p>
<p>The time for self-discipline arrived. In the self-study room, each student sat upright and [unclear], led by the class leader, [unclear] reciting waka poems. At this time, similar reciting [unclear] sounds could be heard from each self-study room. After the recitation, they returned to silence. Suddenly, a [unclear] sound came from afar, and the students [unclear] left their seats like springs and quickly walked out of the self-study room together. In the empty room, every desk and every chair was clean and tidy, and in good order. Looking at the blackboard, I realized that the waka poem just [unclear] recited was from the New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems. (By Lin Weiyi) (Translated from Weekly Mainichi)</p>

<h3>Naval Knowledge - Explanation of Warships</h3>
<p>Battleships</p>
<p>In modern navies, battleships remain the foundation of military strength and the main force in naval warfare. However, due to the theory of aviation supremacy and other theories, the theory of the uselessness of battleships and the theory of abolishing battleships once rose, causing the position of battleships, which had long held the naval throne, to shake. The reason for this is that battleships are heavier and slower than airplanes and cannot avoid airplane attacks, and cannot withstand airplane bombs and torpedo attacks. However, battleships are attacking weapons, and the problem of their defensive power is by no means simply [unclear] to be completed. It must be regarded as a means of attack in itself. Therefore, just as the temporary abnormal development of submarines led to the theory of the uselessness of battleships, by strengthening their defensive power again, battleships can still ensure a certain degree of defensive power and maintain their throne as the main force of the navy.</p>
<p>Regarding modern battleships, taking the representative battleships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan as examples, the thickness of their armor plates is as follows:</p>
<p>In the manufacture of British battleships, after the King George V and Prince of Wales classes, special steel was used for deck armor, and although its thickness was reduced to 13 cm, it had significant strength. As they boasted, this type of battleship could fully resist air force bombing and even bounce back large bombs. However, under the human-bullet attacks of the Japanese navy, its weaknesses were still difficult to hide, and as a result, it inevitably turned into [unclear] off the coast of Malaya. As for the United States, it reduced its speed to 26.7 knots per hour, thereby strengthening the battleship's defensive power. Although its anti-aircraft defensive power has increased, it is equally weak and powerless when attacked by the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force. At this point, the issue of the air force-ization of the navy was raised for discussion again. However, Rear Admiral Taishima Shin, the former Chief of Operations of the United States, once praised battleships greatly, [unclear] as he said: "The position of battleships in the navy is like the position of soldiers in the army. If the United States engages in a long-term war, the last thing that can be used is battleships." Battleships have large cannons, like floating fortresses. Their attack power, long-range endurance, and survivability still maintain their position in the fleet, and they are the backbone of the expeditionary navy.</p>
<p>The main factor in the attack power, which is no different from the life of a battleship, is its main guns. The caliber and number of main guns of battleships of various countries, as currently known, are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan (Nagato class): Eight 16-inch guns</p>
<p>United States (Washington class): Nine 40 cm guns</p>
<p>(Colorado class): Nine 16-inch guns</p>
<p>United Kingdom (King George V class): Twelve 36 cm guns</p>
<p>(Nelson class): Nine 16-inch guns</p>
<p>France (Richelieu class): Eight 38 cm guns</p>
<p>Italy (Littorio class): Nine 38 cm guns</p>
<p>Compared with the ten 12-inch main guns installed on the Dreadnought, which was launched in the Portsmouth Naval Dockyard in the United Kingdom forty years ago (1906) and was the largest and most advanced battleship at the time, the speed of its progress is astonishing. Moreover, some modern battleships are equipped with 18-inch main guns, and many are equipped with anti-aircraft high-angle guns (about 20) of 20 cm or 12 cm, and anti-aircraft machine guns (about 50).</p>
<p>In addition to playing the main role in naval warfare, battleships, such as those of the United States, also use their special characteristics as fortresses to protect aircraft carriers, and use their giant cannons to bombard land.</p>
<p>Aircraft Carriers</p>
<p>Due to the progress of aviation engineering, aircraft have become the central power of modern naval warfare, and aircraft carriers have emerged as a result, so they are a relatively new type of ship. Its characteristic is that it is not only a mobile airfield that acts with great speed, but also an anti-aircraft gun capable of matching a cruiser, equipped with an aircraft hangar, bomb depot, barracks, repair shop, and fuel depot.</p>
<p>Today's aircraft carriers are roughly divided into three types: one is the large standard aircraft carrier with a displacement of more than 30,000 tons, which can be compared to a battleship; another is the auxiliary aircraft carrier with a displacement of 14,000 to 20,000 tons, which is roughly equivalent to a cruiser; and the last is the escort aircraft carrier of about 10,000 tons, which is converted from a merchant ship. Just as their displacements differ, the aircraft carrying capacity that determines their performance is also very different, that is, a standard carrier can carry about 100 aircraft, an auxiliary carrier about 50, and an escort carrier only 20-30.</p>
<p>In addition, there are seaplane carriers that specialize in carrying seaplanes that do not require a flight deck, with a displacement of about 10,000 tons, which can accommodate 20-30 aircraft and have four or five flight launch rails.</p>
<p>The greatest task of an aircraft carrier is to roam freely on the oceans, dispatching its aircraft at any time and any place, so that its fleet can carry out decisive battles within the airspace control area. Other major tasks of aircraft carriers include approaching the coasts of enemy countries and bombing their rear cities or military industrial areas. Therefore, their endurance must be great and their speed of movement must be fast. In particular, high speed is the first requirement for high-performance fast aircraft and increasingly large bombers to be able to take off and land on their narrow decks, so the speed of aircraft carriers in various countries has gradually increased to more than 20 knots.</p>
<p>Because the flight deck of an aircraft carrier is wider than that of other warships, and it must sail against the wind when aircraft take off and land, it is a target for enemy aircraft and submarines. However, with the progress of aircraft development, its value has increased day by day and has even surpassed the battleships that hold the naval throne. Therefore, in the Greater East Asia War, the first target of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force, which was destined to sink, was often selected to be aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Submarines</p>
<p>In modern naval warfare where aircraft are paramount, submarines are valued because of their unique secrecy. Submarines can secretly approach enemy ships and sink enemy capital ships with powerful torpedoes in one fell swoop, making their power terrifying. Therefore, submarines must also have the endurance to participate in fleet operations with battleships and continue to operate for long periods. Moreover, in modern naval warfare, submarines often use their stealth to perform tasks such as reconnaissance, enemy search,警戒, and transportation, and they are important types of ships. Furthermore, submarines make the enemy navy suspect that they exist everywhere on the sea surface. As a result, they can exert unparalleled power in coastal defense, commerce raiding, and land defense, and they are extremely powerful weapons.</p>
<p>However, their mobility is slow and their visibility is narrow. If they are discovered by enemy ships or aircraft, it is extremely difficult to escape quickly. Therefore, all countries are now striving to increase their speed and quantity. The large-scale submarine construction that was once advocated now seems to have been forgotten.</p>
<p>The displacement of submarines is usually 6-700 tons to 2,000 tons, the surface speed is 14-15 knots to 20 knots, and the underwater speed is about 10 knots per hour. They are equipped with 10-12 cm guns, have 5-6 torpedo tubes, and their cruising range is considerable, capable of continuous sailing for one to three months. Therefore, if they depart from a military port in mainland Japan, they can sail to the west coast of the United States for combat and then return to their original port. The latest submarines can also carry aircraft.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that American submarines must be accompanied by lifeboats. If the crew of special ships like submarines are only concerned with the safety of their lives and cannot sacrifice themselves to fight, then the combat effectiveness of the American Navy can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Shipboard Shrines</h3>
<p>The Combined Fleet that decided Japan's fate in the sea battles, when disbanded on December 20, 1905 (Meiji 38), Commander-in-Chief Togo issued an instruction to all subordinates: "We soldiers seek military power from the metaphysical." The soldiers on the battlefield who are currently deciding Japan's fate can be described as having a death-defying fighting spirit. Regardless of the enemy's numerical superiority, they only use their spirit to attack forward. The enemy, the United States and Great Britain, rely solely on vast amounts of iron and material as conditions for combat, emphasizing the elements of the physical world. Looking back at Japan, there is a true difference as great as heaven and earth. What constitutes the foundation of traditional military thought in Japan is spiritual strength, that is, the military spirit cultivated by the nation's unparalleled founding spirit, the fighting spirit of "seven lives to repay the country," the spirit of self-sacrifice, and the traditional spirit of naval bravery.</p>
<p>On February 4, 1895 (Meiji 28), when the torpedo boat squadron launched a night attack on Weihaiwei, Commander-in-Chief Ito strictly ordered, "This officer orders you to sink the enemy ships in the harbor!" All the commanders answered in unison and immediately conveyed the message to the boat captains. Then, they burned their documents, put on new clothes, and desperately launched their attack. None of them hoped to survive, preferring to perish with the enemy ships. Fifty years later, this kind of naval tradition has reappeared.</p>
<p>Even before the Battle of the Sea of Japan, Marshal Togo, who led the "Combined Fleet," was ready to set out to kill the enemy. At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, during the attack on Port Arthur, he sank and destroyed two enemy battleships and one cruiser. The launch of the "successful Japanese surprise attack," the Greater East Asia War, and the annihilation of the enemy's main force in Pearl Harbor, are all nothing more than the accumulation of many years of hard work, fifty years of tradition of the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the steel warships clearly have a shared soul, and within this same tradition, a firm and unwavering Japanese character is cultivated. Accepting all comers, winning every battle, the steel will of the Imperial Fleet riding the long winds and breaking the waves for thousands of miles, coupled with new and sharp machinery, refined technology, vigorous spirit, outstanding command, and leadership, can produce the "unshakable belief in victory." All of these interweaving life-giving warships have shipboard shrines that symbolize the Japanese spirit. Originally, on warships, the Emperor's portrait, the core of the warship's life, and the glorious warship flag are enshrined. However, in shipboard life, as an object of faith for the Japanese people, there must be a god at their side to whom they bow and worship morning and evening. Originally, according to regulations, warships are not necessarily required to have shrines. Although it is unclear how it happened, according to General Kiyokazu Ando, "I remember that there seemed to be none during the Sino-Japanese War, but they already existed during the Russo-Japanese War." Lieutenant General Nagashige Ogasawara also testified to this, saying, "On the Izumo warship, the changing of the Izumo Taisha Shrine to a ship god for worship was before the Russo-Japanese War." But exactly how it happened is really baffling.</p>
<p>From the ancient days of Empress Jingu's conquest of the Three Hans, when Amaterasu Omikami was enshrined and the banner of Hachiman Daibosatsu was hung, the Hachiman ships floating on the seas of Greater East Asia, down to the fishing boats that worshiped Konpira, the Yamato people, who are full of fighting spirit on the sea, are extremely devout in their faith and worship of the gods. Now, all Japanese warships enshrine gods. Therefore, on November 30, 1940 (Showa 15), Naval Custom "Regarding the Enshrinement and Worship of Gods by Warships, Units, Official Ranks, Schools, etc." clearly stipulated in the first item:</p>
<p>1.  The front of the warship shrine should be at the bow.</p>
<p>2.  Objects of worship: (A) Amaterasu Omikami is the main deity, placed in the center of the altar; (B) Shrines that differ according to warships, units, government offices, schools, etc., or the local deity, should be arranged next to the main deity; (C) Omitted</p>
<p>3.  Memorial days: Ise Shrine Memorial Day (Toyouke Daijingu 10th and 16th, Kotaijingu October 17th), the day the warship is launched, the day of completion, or the day the shrine is completed.</p>
<p>Before this, the name of the shrine always included the warship's name. If the warship's name was a country name, then it was named after a palace of the country. If it was a mountain or water name, then the shrine was also named after the mountain or water, and often enshrined Amaterasu Omikami. Whenever there was an opportunity, the captain would organize a worship team to pray for lasting military fortune, and even invite a special priest to initiate a dojo. Even during peacetime, during rowing competitions and shooting tournaments, they would worship at the shrine, and the trophy for winning the competition would be placed next to the shrine. The spiritual center of such a large family as a warship is sustained by revering the ancestors of the nation. Now is wartime. Divine works have become an aid to the main guns, the bridge, and the torpedo tubes in conducting operations. In the quiet and slightly dark shrine inside the ship, a divided spirit of the god is moved to the narrow and gray turret, near the torpedo tube opening, and even in the high-altitude shooting command post, seemingly looking down on the enemy. Japanese soldiers can truly be said to be all divine soldiers. Divine sake is dripped on the torpedoes, and protective amulets are attached, and then incantations are recited in prayer.</p>
<p>Previously, when Japanese submarines went as far as allied Germany, the German Navy understood the reason for the strength of the Japanese Navy when they saw the shipboard shrines. The newsreel "Sinking" of submarine operations in the Indian Ocean also had a scene of a shipboard shrine. Under the shrine were posted the numbers of sunk merchant ships, oil tankers, etc. The crew, covered in sweat, with mud and grease on their faces and backs, in a boat filled with body odor and turbid air, had a shrine made of white wood, and soldiers with devout faces praying before the god. In such a scene, all Japanese people would be moved.</p>
<p>On the eve of the attack on Hawaii, the pilots placed the bombing sights in front of the shrine, praying only for a successful surprise attack, not hoping for survival.</p>
<p>On June 8, 1942 (Showa 17), at 4:00 AM, the entire team was lined up on the hillside where they could see ×× Bay. In front of them was a small box wrapped in a warship flag, on which was enshrined the god of the Shirotae Beach Shrine. They constantly heard a loud voice like the cry of a sandpiper; "Salute to the Shirotae Beach Shrine! Raise guns!" Then, the trumpet sounded high and clear, stirring up the tune of the Japanese national anthem, illuminating the sky of the northern dawn. After finishing, everyone shouted "Long live the Emperor!" with all their might. (Report by a member of the news team)</p>
<p>During the Solomon Sea battle, before the fleet attacked the enemy's sleeping eyes at night, the time of the attack was written on the blackboard in the flagship's officer's room:</p>
<p>The time of the attack is 8:30 PM. The more I thought about this, the more uneasy I felt, but the uneasy feelings gradually intensified. I shook my head, ran out of the officer's room, turned left along the corridor, and ran to the white wooden shrine, standing there silently. A bright light was lit inside the shrine. A duty soldier stood next to it with a gun. The shrine was still new. Seeing a white wooden shrine inside a steel warship aroused infinite thoughts. (Report by a member of the Niwa news team "Sea Battle")</p>
<p>In a short while, the main guns opened fire. The night curtain of the Strait of Tulagi was torn apart by a thunderous roar, and a tragic flame appeared in the dark ocean, shaking the world in the universe. However, around the white wooden shrine, it was as quiet as usual. The duty soldier under the light stood like a statue. As fixed as the captain standing on the bridge –</p>
<p>Accompanied by the gods of the nation's ancestors, illuminating the four seas, embarking on the expedition. (Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>
