<h3>刷新在華日僑經濟案日決定具體細則企業指導方針已根本改變</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>遵守防空法令</h3>
<p>今日爲第十七次定例防空日，本市全區舉行演習。定例防空日之舉行，其目的在隨時提高市民之警惕心，俾及時完成一切防空必要的準備。在目前時局之下，敵機隨時可至，我們在防空日固然必須互相警戒，遵守防空法令及指示，即在平日，無論晝夜，無論起息，都須有防空的準備。</p>
<p>根據歷屆防空演習後有關當局的報告，及我們耳聞目睹的種種事寶，深覺大部分市民，對於防空的必要凖備仍感缺乏，對於防空法令仍不注意，不必說柏林倫敦在遭受空襲時的慘狀，就以近數月以來敵機轟炸漢口廣州情形而言，市民對於減少損害的防空工作，實有充分認識與凖備的必要。</p>
<p>關於防空工作中，最初步的燈火管制方面，雖實施已久，尚未滿意做到。普通民居，燈光外洩，固爲常事，即高樓大厦之高等住戶，未有燈光遮蔽設備者，亦隨處可見，而在規定供電時間以外，仍電炬通明，似以違法行爲爲榮　之舉。至於街頭攤販，星火萬點，更爲隨地皆是。最可怪者，雖在空襲時間，若干特殊階級之汽車，開放其車頭雙燈，光芒遠射，數丈以外，光可奪目。馳聘通衢，保甲防察人員，祗能驚訝目送，而不敢進言勸阻。凡此各種情形，對於本市防空燈火會制，都是有百害而無一利的。我們希望市民大衆務須隨時自檢，以免被查覺後受嚴重警處。而若干高樓大厦之特殊階級，爲一般防空保甲人員干涉進動所不及者，尤當深自檢點。而負責防空人員對於普通住戶，隨時指導，隨時糾正，對於特殊階級尤當毫無顧忌，執行法令所賦與之任務，亦須隨時糾正。</p>
<p>再就市民對於防空工作，所以不加注意一點觀察，實由於若干錯党及僥倖心理所致。我們應先認淸，一旦歐戰結束，敵人英美對中國大陸之冒險野心更將積極。如誤信流言。以爲某某地區，可望不致被炸，自慰自欺﹔或託之天命，以求僥倖。凡此種種，皆由於對時局及本市之環境，認識不足，因有此種錯誤心理，實足以招致個人或一家的危險。希望市民認淸大局，勿存僥倖苟安之錯誤心理，人人奮起，協助當局，完整一切防空設施。不僅在防空日，即在平時，無分晝夜，隨時隨地存有敵機來襲的警戒心，遵守防空法令，完成防空準備。</p>
<h3>新運蘇分會徵集廢金屬</h3>

<h3>努力飛機生產開拓勝利途徑</h3>
<p>——日軍需相向國民廣播—</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日豐田軍需相於七日下午七時廣播，題為「開拓勝利途徑之飛機生產」。所論要旨如次：當吾人思及特攻隊勇士，為何以靑年之生命，實行拼撞攻舉，內心即有不能用言諸形容之感覺。目下戰局祇須有充分之飛機、則作戰必趨有利展開，儘量以多數且堅實之飛機送上前綫，此爲今日振轉戰局之關鍵。凡從事飛機生產者，與前綫勇士同樣爲拯救祖國危急之特攻隊。吾人響應唯有爲君國危急而赴難，爲君國之特攻勇士，信賴後方工作諸君付託飛機接濟之重任，以每一架飛機，每一艘軍艦敢行拼撞。思及塞班島之陷落，使硫黃島亦淪入敵手，而冲繩島吾人必須維護到底。飛機係用一萬件以上部份品所組成，爲極高度之綜合工業，其中無論任何一種部份品不足，則不能確保優良之生產，故須有嚴密周到之綜合計劃，與澈底之工作管理。目下戰局爲乘機對飛機之航空決戰，吾人爲擊滅沖繩方面頑敵，必須努力趕造飛機送上前綫，以開拓勝利之大提，兼本部　務局局長袁愈　，呈辭兼職、　請免去兼職，並擬請任命蔡秉祿兼本部邊務局局長，決議通過。</p>

<h3>渝共雙方暗鬥內幕</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　據本市可靠方面消息透露：渝共雙方磨擦尖銳化，且渝國民黨內部，更不勝矛盾，其間派別分岐，相互對峙。最扳中共爲對付渝所召開之六全大會，特舉行中共第七次全國代表大會，主張促成聯合政權，而渝方在六全大會亦展開應付中共政治攻勢。茲將渝共此次暗鬥內幕，分誌如次：</p>
<p>中共全會針對渝方</p>
<p>據延安新華社電稱：中共第七次全國代表大會，於四月下旬在延安舉行，由毛澤東在大會上作政治報告，主張組織聯合政府，聲明並非爲渝國民黨之利益想，乃求打開中國出路，爲實現聯合政府及施行民主綱領而奮鬥，必須達到此目的。同時在延安從速召集中國解放區人民代表會議云云。查毛澤東此次之報告，乃向爲共黨本身一貫主張，故對於延安共黨方面之從速召集全國代表大會之意義，甚堪注意，其用意不出爲應付渝政權在五月五日所召開之六全大會。按中共於一九二一年成立以來，述續舉行全國代表大會有六次，惟至一九二八年七月後，中輟舉行，直至本年方始舉行第七次大會，歷經一十七載，故其目的，當為針對此次渝方所舉行之六全大會也。</p>
<p>渝國民黨二派對立</p>
<p>本月五日渝國民黨舉行之六全大會，蔣介石特致開會詞，提出定於十一月十二日召開國民大會，及實施憲政，以促成種種必要政策，其目的乃對付共黨之政治攻勢。然渝國民黨間內部芥蒂　生，磨擦矛盾。目前有二派對立尖銳化，一爲中央黨部組織部長陳立夫所領導之國粹派，向反對中共行爲，其主要實力，爲陳立夫陳果夫所主持之勵志社，並擁有國民黨中央調查統計局長徐克均及賀耀祖，以及軍事委員會調査統計局長戴笠，均屬黃浦系。在渝國民黨對付陳立夫最有力派爲朱家　，亦稱親歐美派，主要實力爲中央硏究院及康澤所領導之三民主義靑年國，張勵生所領導之成社，且接近宋子文及陳誠與保定軍官學校畢業生。兩派　　頗甚，陳立夫派主張中國本位者，完全以中國自主立塲作一切計劃，而朱家　派乃依靠國際上之方案，以維持中國地位，故此次六全大會必有相互磨擦，影響頗巨。刻渝政權束手無策，至為苦悶。今後所走路向，往中國自主立塲走去，抑或依賴第三勢力維持本身地位，極堪注意。</p>
<h3>日本的農村防空</h3>
<p>「敵機的轟炸描射，祗限於都市，鄉下是不要緊的。」這樣的如意算盤是不許打的。在稻麥成熟期，敵機或將用燒夷片來攪亂，歐戰初起時，英空軍曾在德軍佔領下的烏克　殼倉地　撒布燒夷片，最近駐華英空軍對於日軍佔領後的湖南道縣，也曾使用同樣方法。茲將日本農政局長·防衛課長，農村經營課長·農產課長等對農村防空的意見，以問答的方式綜述於後。</p>
<p>（問）關於農村防空，有什麽對策呢？</p>
<p>（答）農村與都會不同，是散開的，房屋也分散疎隔，所以要擬立和都會一樣的防空對策，事實上是困難的，而且決不妥當。何况過分致力於防空活動的設施，不必要的影響農村人民的神經，反足妨礙農民本務——增產活動，結果會成一般的防空對策以外，農商省並無任何具體的指導。唯情勢旣已如此，自非實行積極的防空指導不可。</p>
<p>（問）那末，中央指導方針的倫　如何？</p>
<p>（答）一般的指導，第一是督促家農　造防空壕，其次便是勵行燈火管制，與都市一樣嚴格。此外還有一點必須勵行，就是防火用水的準備。鄕村中大抵每戶都有一口井，但能作為防火用水源而能分秒不遲誤者，則為數很少。例如用吊桶汲水的井，在危急的塲合就不合用了。凡無自流井之處，必須在屋旁掘一個水池，有二十四尺見方就得，深度最好在二尺以上。這個水池平時可當作魚池，養些　魚之類在內，那就更有用了。總之農家大多用草　　，所以防火用水的準備，不問在非常時期或平時，都是重要的。以上所說，祇是農村住民應該遵守的一般防空原則，而農家尤須注意下列各項，即在農忙時期工作於田畝間時，　應保護成熟的農作物，　防護農業倉庫（食　倉庫），　分散貯藏食糧種子等，　分散貯藏晨具·食器·衣服等日用物品，　保護家畜。在種稻或收刈時，多數人均在野外工作，所以須預先決定田野間的警報傳達方法。在發出緊急警報時，最好避入附近的樹林裏，或　入預失　好的洞中，上用稻草之類遮蔽。</p>
<p>保議成熟的晨作物，實在最爲要緊。目前，敵機的轟炸戰術限於燒夷彈和炸彈，今後澦料將撒布燒夷片及有害農作物的蘭·虫，所以必須預先防備。茲將日本福岡縣對付燒夷片的辦法，臚述如下：</p>
<p>滅火對策：燒夷片爲產　燐的黑色賽珞　板，面積五至六平方　。由黃　的自動發火而引燃賽珞　。自撤下到起火止的時間，視落下塲所及季節而異。唯因其形狀與色彩等，頗難發見、所以必須小心。直接觸碰黃燐，能使皮　灼傷，所以發見時必須用火　將它拾起來，丟入盛滿水的器皿中。已經燃燒的燒夷片，澆水下去雖會熄滅，但以後乾燥了時仍會再燒起來，因此務須小心處置。</p>
<p>農作物措置：稻麥在成熟期以後，雖沒有被害之懼，但到成熟的時候就很易燃燒，所以一到適於收刈的時期，應立刻收割。（譯自四月六日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>前年十二月八日，大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方份子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第爲友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀，且　視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，　使渝方份子，不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並　以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處，　施轟炸，殘害平民。在偷方份子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛　，固屬可恥；而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾。國民政府爲此宣告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一撈英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻。凡我國民，當知此爲實現聞父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體正義和平之獲得，胥繫於此；其一心一德，戰力始終，以　　此　大時代之偉大使命。中華民國三十一年一月九日主席汪兆銘</p>
<h3>在里姆斯簽約歐戰吿結束德新外長向國人廣播</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據倫敦電，英情報局發表：根據英美蘇三國間協定，英首相邱吉爾定八日下午三時發表正式聲明、並作廣播演說。</p>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　據英國電台昨夜廣播：於德國投降未宣佈前，倫敦莫斯科華盛頓間正進行頻　之無綫電接觸，以作最後之緊急商計，邱吉爾首相於其官邸宣佈歐戰結束之準確時間，亦依此項商討之結果而決定，現今對戰事結束之宣佈，僅為技術問題。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電</p>
<p>美聯社消息：昨日下午二時四十一分（法國時間），於法境里姆斯文森　華將宣之司令部所在地直行無條件投降，如此遂使經過五年零八個月又六日之歐戰，於茲宣告正式結束。該投降條約係由德軍參謀長喬　將軍代表德國簽字，艾森　華之參謀長史密斯將軍代表反軸心最高司令部簽字，　斯洛柏洛夫將軍代表蘇聯簽字，西法斯將軍代表法國簽字。當簽字時，艾森霍華將軍並未出席，但旋即接見喬爾將軍及其代表團及斐里德斯堡將軍，當時詢問渠等對加　德國之投降條件能否實行，渠等即答日「可」。於德電台對德人廣播杜尼資大將命令所有德軍全體無條件投降之後，德國無條件投降遂正式加以公布。</p>
<p>德外長廣播詞</p>
<p>德外長克　西克對德人廣播稱：「同胞乎·最高指揮部已命令德軍無條件投降，德國於近六年之英勇奮「後，已屈伏於敵人之優勢武力下，如　續作戰，僅為無意議之流血而已。負有對德國將來之責任之政府，於人力物力崩潰之情勢下，遂要求敵人停止敵對行動。吾人對德國兵士最表同情，但國人對敵人加於德之條件之嚴酷，毋作自欺之想像，對德人應於生活上作極度犧牲之要求，乃爲必然之事實。德人須負此重擔，而盡忠於吾人之義務尊目的，有其同等神聖之重要。吾人將竭其一切人力物力，以使歐洲於戰禍之後，恢復其創傷。</p>
<h3>特魯曼與格魯會談</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電據華盛頓消息：特魯曼總統昨與代理國務卿格魯及助理國務卿格拉頓淮行會談。</p>
<h3>與柏林共命運希特勒殉國因果郭培爾遺骸已被發現</h3>
<p>東京八日中央電　據同盟社駐德南部某地特派員江尻氏消息稱：希特勒英勇殉國之宣佈、對德人乃一重大打擊。消息靈通方面稱，希特勒堅持與柏林共命運，此舉使國社黨之統治，於歷史上宣告解體，如此可予德人及國社黨之理想有恢復之機會。各最高級將領曾勸希氏離開柏林，因其以為希氏茍不死於重大危機中，乃為特別重要者。渠曾一度允許與彼等於最後一分鐘離開柏林，遂預備</p>
<p>特種飛機</p>
<p>一架以備應用、該機能於闊七十公尺之「東西軸心」路起飛，（該路係通過柏林之提爾公園，距國會僅三百公尺）但希特勒決定留居怕林，以準備作英勇殉國。其變計之理由，現仍不能獲悉，或以爲渠希望能吸引大量蘇軍，予以致命打擊，渠以爲親自指揮作戰，必可完成其目的也。當蘇軍侵入距柏林五十公里之蘇森及七十公里之比爾錫時，遂完成包圍柏林，時希特勒巳知其計劃失敗，遂決定</p>
<p>自行毀滅</p>
<p>其他消息靈通方面以爲與英挑手共同擊滅布爾雪維克主義者計劃之失敗，乃促成其殉國之決心，於「我之奮鬥」一書中之理念，現仍未動搖。希氏於戰事爆發後，於其演說中亦嘗提及之，雖或獻議其須要求德蘇和平者，希氏加以拒絕，且絕無與布爾雪維克主義妥協之心。據可靠方面透露，希特勒會反對德蘇互不侵犯條約，但終於前外長里賓特洛甫所說服。中立方面消息，希特勒於四月二十一日使希姆萊及杜尼資前往北德，以瑞典紅十字會為居間人，以對英作</p>
<p>最後呼籲</p>
<p>但此企圖仍歸失敗。如此其最後之夢想已告幻滅，希氏遂決定於槍林彈雨中，殉國於德國會。傳希氏死於五月一日，時已將軍政大權交於杜尼資掌掃，但希特勒決計戰死，其事甚明。前於一九三九年九月三日，希氏曾委戈林爲其第一繼承人，赫斯爲其第二繼承人，今赫斯已被排除，而戈林復因未能重組德國空軍，以罰抗反軸心空中攻勢，遂失衆望，故戈林已不被認爲適當之繼承人，此爲其辭職之理由也。潛艇作戰專家杜尼資大將，於戰事　發前不久，乃一少校而已，於五年內晋級海軍大將、甚爲希氏及各領袖所器重，杜氏雖爲　護希特勒者，但非國社黨黨員，此爲其被選爲希特勒繼承人之一因也。</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　倫敦電，英政府當局七日宣稱：郭培爾博士及其夫人子女遺骸，已在柏林市內發現。但希元首及戈林元帥遣骸尚未發現。又據美聯社莫斯科電，蘇軍將士對在元首官邸內發現之屍體加以調查，但希特勒之遺骸迄未發現。</p>

<p>三頭會議英方主張</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據合眾社舊金與訊，波蘭給爭，若不經特魯曼邱吉騵史太林三頭協議，則無親決之可能。又據倫數之蘇聯社訊，英政府方面以徑殲關係決褻為不智，放紹誠主張樂行三頭會談。</p>

<h3>嚴守燈火管制保障全巿安寗李防空副科長廣播演說</h3>
<p>警察局防空科團科長李振寰，於昨日下午七時廿分至八時在上海廣播電台廣播燈火管制的重要及使用銅　以代警報的方法及其他防空問題，茲分誌如下；</p>
<p>本市在大東亞戰爭決勝階段內，空襲危險亦日形加緊迫，故一切之防空設備急不容緩，且有迫不及待之勢。過去雖經陸海軍防空司令部市民防空本部警察局努力指導及保甲自警團之協助，但市民漫不經心，在空襲時市民往往日間仰首天空，一觀竟究，形如兒戯，危險實大，非但炸彈落下，以致傷亡，且高射砲彈隨時可飛落傷人。所以在白天遇到空襲時要趕快的避入防空　，切勿在路上觀望，以免流彈彈片等之危險，在夜間遇到空襲切不可開燈或燃燈燭，以免為轟炸之目的。茲將以下重點喚起各位注意：</p>
<p>燈火管制</p>
<p>燈火管制之意義及重要性：來襲之飛機，不易被人發現於夜間，最易飛至目的地，其最大之目標爲燈火，尤以大都市之燈光反照天空在距離一二百里之遠即能望見，易受侵襲，若能將燈火隱蔽，使來機失去目標，即爲燈光管制之目的。假使全市燈火隱蔽，而尚有極少數市民不遵守燈火管制，則全市民衆俱有遭受空襲之危害。人民生命財產受害非淺，故當局對於遵守不力者，當以嚴重處罰。</p>
<p>燈火管制分為三種：一，準備管制日常生活不需要燈火如霓紅燈，門燈，廣告燈，不能使用。二，警戒管制在警戒警報中，店舖燈不必要者不得開啓，否則與住宅燈用隱蔽方法遮光。三，空襲管制全部熄燈，或隱蔽，總不使之漏光。　希望市民切不可將燈光洩漏並注意下列各項事件：一，室內燈須用燈罩掩蓋，二，窗用黑布遮掩，有百葉窗者須將百葉窗關閉。三，最緊要者天窗，平常人不注意，然在天空甚為明顯。此後警察對燈火管制將發動澈底取締，希市民注意。</p>
<p>用井須知</p>
<p>在空襲時，自來水管時有被損壞之　，在內地有河水可用，但在上海自米水斷絕時，無處可以取水，祗有一種補救辦法，即　井，希望市民每甲多多掘井，下列用途：一，飲食用，二，消防用（救火用，如燒夷彈等），三洗　用（洗衣服及淸潔用）。</p>
<p>市民防空本部巳與掘井商取得通絡，總使掘井價目便宜，工作材料良好，務使市民得到種種便利，如欲得知詳細情形，可至防空本部福州路二百八十號一樓，即四馬路警察總局對面。</p>
<p>為預想　報之障礙，以後於警報發令及解除時，兼用以下二種辦法：警戒警報、（並口頭傳達）　旗每次打　三響（每次約隔五秒至十秒）空襲警報（並口頭傳達）紅旗　打十數次空襲警報解除（並口頭傳達）　旗（警戒同）每次打鑼三響（每次約隔五秒至十秒）警戒警報解除（並口頭傳達）隊旗每次打　二饗</p>
<p>如係訓練警報須在旗上加黃旗一面，</p>
<p>打鑼時亦須加以訓練二字，待避每次連打　十數次（空襲警報同）</p>
<p>所不同者僅口頭傳達時用「待避」二字</p>
<p>除以上二種方法已實施外，當局正在計劃各種</p>
<p>方法，以期盡全盡美。</p>
<p>訓練時口頭傳達應冠以「訓練」二字。</p>
<p>設防空壕</p>
<p>防空壕在空襲時為巿民避難之安全處所，每個警察分局區域內，現已設有防空壕，但有的防空壕沒有蓋的，有的防空壕設備很不完全，道是全爲經濟所限。上海掘至二三尺即有水發現，故僅可建築半地式（即一在地下，一半在地上面）防空壕，此種防空壕對於直落彈，雖然不能抵抗，但隣近如有炸彈落下，對於避免爆風彈片高射砲彈等等危險，是很有效用的。希望市民普遍的設置防空壕，本市市民防空本部備有詳細計劃，如有市民欲建造防空壕者可向該本部詢問。</p>

<h3>Revision of Economic Plan for Japanese Residents in China, Concrete Details Decided in Japan, Guiding Principles for Enterprises Fundamentally Changed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Following the Japanese government's previous cabinet meeting passage of "Establishing Political and Economic Countermeasures in China," it further decided on February 15th, at a vice-ministerial conference, "Regarding the Revision of Economic Activities Plan for Japanese Residents in China." Consequently, the guiding principles for Japanese businesses in China have been fundamentally changed, abandoning the Japanese-style economic control methods and establishing enterprise guiding principles that adapt to local conditions. Concrete details have recently been decided. Therefore, on the 8th, the Ministry of Finance convened the heads of approximately 30 Japanese commercial companies in China to explain this matter. The basic guiding principle for various implementations of this decision is to entrust the operation of local businesses to local responsible parties for decision-making, in light of future Sino-Japanese relations and the trends of the local economic situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Firmly Defend Key Positions in Tarakan, Enemy's Attack on Oilfields Ultimately Thwarted</h3>
<p>Borneo Front, 8th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the land battle situation in Tarakan, since the morning of the 5th, strong enemy forces, under the cover of artillery bombardment, attacked the oilfield area.

The enemy is urgently seeking to accelerate the battle situation, exerting great effort to repair the landing pier. It has been in use since the 5th to strengthen troop reinforcements and supplies. At the same time, a portion of warships sailed towards the eastern coast, opening fire on the oilfield area, attempting to land in that area.</p>

<h3>Observe Air Defense Regulations</h3>
<p>Today is the seventeenth regular air defense day, and exercises are being held throughout the city. The purpose of holding regular air defense days is to constantly raise the vigilance of citizens so as to complete all necessary preparations for air defense in a timely manner. Under the current situation, enemy aircraft can arrive at any time. We must be on guard against each other and abide by air defense laws and instructions not only on air defense days, but also at all times, day and night, whether awake or asleep, and have air defense preparations in place.</p>
<p>Based on reports from relevant authorities after previous air defense exercises and various facts we have heard and witnessed, we deeply feel that most citizens still lack the necessary preparations for air defense and do not pay attention to air defense regulations. Not to mention the tragic situation in Berlin and London when they were subjected to air raids, even based on the enemy's bombing of Hankou and Guangzhou in recent months, citizens really need a full understanding and preparation for air defense work to reduce damage.</p>
<p>Regarding the most basic aspect of air defense work, light control, although it has been implemented for a long time, it has not been done satisfactorily. It is common for ordinary residences to leak light, and even among high-class residents of high-rise buildings, those without light shielding facilities can be seen everywhere. Moreover, outside of the regulated power supply hours, lights are still brightly lit, as if taking pride in illegal behavior. As for street vendors, countless sparks can be seen everywhere. Most strangely, even during air raids, some special classes of vehicles open their headlights, projecting bright beams that can be seen for dozens of feet, dazzling the eyes. Patrol personnel can only watch in amazement and dare not offer advice or discouragement. All these situations are harmful and without benefit to the city's air defense light control. We hope that the general public must inspect themselves at all times to avoid being severely punished after being detected. Furthermore, some special classes in high-rise buildings, who are beyond the reach of ordinary air defense patrol personnel's interference, should especially reflect on themselves. Those responsible for air defense should provide guidance and correction to ordinary residents at all times, and should carry out the duties entrusted to them by law without any hesitation, especially towards special classes, and should correct them at all times.</p>
<p>Regarding the reason why citizens do not pay attention to air defense work, it is due to certain misconceptions and wishful thinking. We should first recognize that once the European war ends, the enemy's adventurous ambitions toward mainland China will become more active. Do not be misled by rumors, thinking that certain areas will hopefully not be bombed, deceiving ourselves; or entrusting it to fate, seeking luck. All of this stems from an insufficient understanding of the situation and the city's environment. Such erroneous thinking is sufficient to invite danger to individuals or families. We hope that citizens will recognize the overall situation, not harbor the erroneous thinking of seeking luck and complacency, and that everyone will rise up and assist the authorities in completing all air defense facilities. Not only on air defense days, but also at all times, day and night, have a vigilance against enemy aircraft attacks, abide by air defense regulations, and complete air defense preparations.</p>

<h3>Strive for Aircraft Production, Open Up the Path to Victory</h3>
<p>—Japanese Minister of Munitions Addresses the Nation—</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Munitions Toyoda broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 7th, with the title "Aircraft Production Opening the Path to Victory." The main points of his speech are as follows: When we think of the Kamikaze warriors and why they risked their youthful lives to carry out ramming attacks, we feel emotions that cannot be described in words. In the current war situation, as long as there are sufficient aircraft, the battle will develop favorably. Sending as many and as strong aircraft to the front line as possible is the key to reversing the war situation today. Those engaged in aircraft production are like the Kamikaze units on the front line, who are rescuing the country from crisis. Our response is only to go to the rescue of the country in crisis, to be the Kamikaze warriors for the country, and to entrust to the comrades working in the rear the important task of supplying aircraft. With each aircraft and each warship, we dare to ram. Thinking of the fall of Saipan, the loss of Iwo Jima to the enemy, we must defend Okinawa to the end. Aircraft are composed of more than 10,000 parts, and it is a highly integrated industry. If any part is insufficient, excellent production cannot be ensured. Therefore, there must be a strict and thorough comprehensive plan and thorough work management. The current war situation is a decisive air battle on aircraft. In order to annihilate the stubborn enemy in Okinawa, we must strive to rush production of aircraft and send them to the front line to open up the path to victory. In addition, Yuan Yu, Director of the Bureau of General Affairs of this Ministry, has resigned from his concurrent position. It is requested that his concurrent position be removed, and it is proposed to appoint Cai Binglu as Director of the Bureau of Frontier Affairs of this Ministry, the resolution was passed.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Undercurrent Struggle Between the CCP and KMT in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai News - According to reliable sources in this city: The friction between the CCP and KMT in Chongqing is intensifying, and the internal contradictions within the KMT in Chongqing are even more overwhelming. Factional differences and mutual confrontation exist. The CCP is most concerned about the Sixth Plenary Session convened by Chongqing to deal with the CCP. It held the Seventh National Congress of the CCP, advocating the promotion of a united government, while the Chongqing side also launched a political offensive to deal with the CCP at the Sixth Plenary Session. The inside story of this undercurrent struggle between the CCP and KMT in Chongqing is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The CCP National Congress is Aimed at the Chongqing Side</p>
<p>According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Yan'an, the Seventh National Congress of the CCP was held in Yan'an in late April. Mao Zedong made a political report at the congress, advocating the organization of a united government, stating that it was not for the benefit of the KMT in Chongqing, but to find a way out for China, and to strive for the realization of a united government and the implementation of a democratic program, and this goal must be achieved. At the same time, it also stated that a People's Representative Conference of the Chinese Liberated Areas would be convened as soon as possible in Yan'an. It should be noted that Mao Zedong's report is the consistent position of the Communist Party itself. Therefore, the significance of the Yan'an Communist Party convening a national congress as soon as possible is very noteworthy. Its intention is to deal with the Sixth Plenary Session convened by the Chongqing government on May 5. Since its establishment in 1921, the CCP has held six national congresses. However, after July 1928, the congress was suspended until the seventh congress was held this year, after seventeen years. Therefore, its purpose is to target the Sixth Plenary Session held by the Chongqing side.</p>
<p>Two Factions Oppose Each Other in the Chongqing KMT</p>
<p>At the Sixth Plenary Session held by the Chongqing KMT on the 5th of this month, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the opening ceremony, proposing to convene the National Congress on November 12 and implement constitutional government to promote various necessary policies. His purpose was to deal with the Communist Party's political offensive. However, internal resentments and frictions exist within the Chongqing KMT. Currently, there are two opposing factions that have become sharply opposed. One is the national essence faction led by Chen Lifu, Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, who has always opposed the CCP's actions. Their main strength is the Lizi Society, which is presided over by Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu, and they also have Xu Kejun, Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the KMT Central Committee, and He Yaozu, as well as Dai Li, Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission, all of whom belong to the Whampoa clique. The most powerful faction in the Chongqing KMT to deal with Chen Lifu is Zhu Jiahua, also known as the pro-European and American faction. Their main strength is the Central Research Institute and the Three People's Principles Youth Corps led by Kang Ze, and the Cheng Society led by Zhang Lisheng, and they are close to Song Ziwen and Chen Cheng and graduates of the Baoding Military Academy. The contradictions between the two factions are quite significant. The Chen Lifu faction advocates Chinese localization and makes all plans based entirely on China's independent position, while the Zhu Jiahua faction relies on international solutions to maintain China's position. Therefore, there must be mutual friction at this Sixth Plenary Session, which will have a great impact. The Chongqing government is currently at a loss and is very depressed. Which direction it will take in the future, whether it will move towards China's independent position or rely on a third force to maintain its own position, is highly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rural Air Defense</h3>
<p>The wishful thinking that "enemy aircraft bombings are limited to cities, the countryside is not important" is not allowed. During the ripening season of rice and wheat, enemy aircraft may use incendiary devices to disrupt things. At the beginning of the European war, the British Air Force scattered incendiary devices in the Ukrainian granary area occupied by the German army. Recently, the British Air Force stationed in China also used the same method in Dao County, Hunan Province, after it was occupied by the Japanese army. The opinions of the director of the Japanese Agricultural Administration Bureau, the head of the Defense Section, the head of the Rural Management Section, and the head of the Agricultural Products Section on rural air defense are summarized below in a question-and-answer format.</p>
<p>(Question) What countermeasures are there regarding rural air defense?</p>
<p>(Answer) Rural areas are different from cities, they are scattered, and houses are also sparsely separated, so it is difficult and absolutely inappropriate to formulate the same air defense countermeasures as in cities. Moreover, excessive dedication to air defense facilities will unnecessarily affect the nerves of rural people and hinder the farmers' main task of increasing production. As a result, other than general air defense countermeasures, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has no specific guidance. However, since the situation is already like this, it is necessary to implement active air defense guidance.</p>
<p>(Question) Then, what is the central guiding principle?</p>
<p>(Answer) The general guidance is, first, to urge each household to build air-raid shelters, and second, to strictly implement lighting control, as strictly as in cities. In addition, there is one more thing that must be encouraged, and that is the preparation of water for fire fighting. In the countryside, most households have a well, but very few can be used as a source of water for fire fighting without any delay. For example, a well from which water is drawn with a bucket is not suitable in an emergency. Where there is no artesian well, a pool must be dug next to the house, twenty-four feet square is enough, and the depth is best more than two feet. This pool can usually be used as a fish pond, and it would be even more useful to raise some fish in it. In short, most farmhouses use thatched roofs, so the preparation of water for fire fighting is important at all times, both in emergencies and in peacetime. The above is only a general air defense principle that rural residents should follow, and farmhouses should pay special attention to the following items, namely, when working in the fields during the busy farming season: protect mature crops, protect agricultural warehouses (food warehouses), store food and seeds separately, store daily necessities such as furniture, tableware, and clothing separately, and protect livestock. During rice planting or harvesting, most people work in the fields, so a method of transmitting alarms in the fields must be determined in advance. When an emergency alarm is issued, it is best to take refuge in a nearby forest or hide in a pre-prepared cave, covered with straw or the like.</p>
<p>Protecting mature crops is really the most important thing. Currently, the enemy's bombing tactics are limited to incendiary bombs and bombs, and it is expected that incendiary fragments and pests harmful to crops will be scattered in the future, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. The measures taken by Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, to deal with incendiary fragments are listed below:</p>
<p>Fire extinguishing countermeasures: Incendiary fragments are black celluloid plates containing white phosphorus, with an area of ​​five to six square inches. The yellow phosphorus ignites spontaneously and ignites the celluloid. The time from landing to ignition varies depending on the landing site and season. However, because of their shape and color, they are difficult to detect, so caution is required. Direct contact with white phosphorus can cause burns to the skin, so when found, it must be picked up with fire tongs and thrown into a container filled with water. Incendiary fragments that have already burned will be extinguished when watered, but will burn again when dry, so be careful when handling them.</p>
<p>Crop measures: Rice and wheat are not afraid of damage after the ripening period, but they are very flammable when ripe, so they should be harvested immediately when they are suitable for harvesting. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 6)</p>

<p>National Government Declaration of War</p>
<p>On December 8th of the year before last, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public security, improving people's livelihood, and striving to increase national strength to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and others continue to pursue their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with elements in Chongqing to join the so-called British and American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill each other. Recently, their violence has been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of the friendly nation of Japan, and their bases for invading East Asia have been lost. They are now resorting to more cunning schemes and disregard the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government. They use elements in Chongqing to continuously harass us to obstruct the progress of various constructions, and use their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements in Chongqing, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, and personally acting as traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful; while Britain and the United States, harboring ulterior motives towards East Asia, exhaust their ability to sow discord in an attempt to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which should be met with common hatred by the nations of East Asia. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its utmost to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to overthrow the cruelty of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share the same determination for the prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should strengthen cooperation in order to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for several years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country now joins the Greater East Asia War, and we should echo each other in order to contribute to the just new order of the whole world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism. The restoration of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the whole world depend on this; they should unite their hearts and minds, fight to the end, and fulfill this great mission of this great era. January 9, 31st year of the Republic of China Chairman Wang Zhaoming</p>
<h3>The European War Ends with the Signing of the Treaty in Reims, the New German Foreign Minister Broadcasts to the Nation</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a London dispatch, the British Intelligence Agency announced that, according to the agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, British Prime Minister Churchill is scheduled to make a formal statement and broadcast an address at 3:00 PM on the 8th.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a British radio broadcast last night, prior to the announcement of Germany's surrender, frequent radio contact was being conducted between London, Moscow, and Washington for final emergency consultations. The exact time when Prime Minister Churchill announced the end of the European War at his official residence was also determined based on the results of this discussion. The announcement of the end of the war is now merely a technical matter.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Associated Press News: At 2:41 PM yesterday (French time), Germany unconditionally surrendered in Vincent, Reims, France, where General Eisenhower's headquarters are located. Thus, the European War, which lasted for five years, eight months, and six days, was officially declared over. The surrender treaty was signed by General Jodl, Chief of Staff of the German Army, on behalf of Germany; General Smith, Chief of Staff of Eisenhower, on behalf of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force; General Susloparov, on behalf of the Soviet Union; and General Sevez, on behalf of France. General Eisenhower was not present at the signing, but immediately met with General Jodl and his delegation, as well as General Friesburg. He asked them if they could implement the terms of surrender to Germany, and they replied, "Yes." After the German radio broadcast General Dönitz's order to all German troops to surrender unconditionally, Germany's unconditional surrender was officially announced.</p>
<p>Broadcast Speech by the German Foreign Minister</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Krosigk broadcast to the German people: "Fellow countrymen, the Supreme Command has ordered the German army to surrender unconditionally. After nearly six years of valiant fighting, Germany has succumbed to the superior forces of the enemy. To continue fighting would only be meaningless bloodshed. The government, which bears the responsibility for Germany's future, has requested the enemy to cease hostilities in the face of the collapse of human and material resources. We express our deepest sympathy to the German soldiers, but the nation should not deceive itself about the severity of the conditions imposed on Germany by the enemy. It is inevitable that Germans will be required to make extreme sacrifices in their lives. Germans must bear this heavy burden, and being loyal to our duties and goals is equally sacred. We will do our utmost to restore Europe from the wounds of war."</p>

<h3>Sharing Fate with Berlin, Hitler Commits Suicide, the Remains of Goebbels Have Been Discovered</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Mr. Ejiri, a special correspondent of the Domei News Agency stationed in southern Germany: The announcement of Hitler's heroic suicide was a major blow to the German people. Well-informed sources said that Hitler insisted on sharing fate with Berlin, which declared the disintegration of the Nazi Party's rule in history, so that the German people and the Nazi Party's ideals could have a chance to recover. Top generals had advised Hitler to leave Berlin, because they thought it was especially important for Hitler not to die in a major crisis. He had once allowed them to leave Berlin at the last minute, so they prepared</p>
<p>Special Aircraft</p>
<p>An aircraft was prepared for use, capable of taking off on the "East-West Axis" road, which was 70 meters wide (the road passes through Berlin's Tiergarten, only 300 meters from the Reichstag), but Hitler decided to stay in Berlin to prepare for a heroic suicide. The reasons for his change of plan are still unknown, or it is believed that he hoped to attract a large number of Soviet troops to inflict a fatal blow on them, and he believed that he could achieve his goal by personally commanding the battle. When the Soviet army invaded Süssen, 50 kilometers from Berlin, and Beelitz, 70 kilometers from Berlin, the encirclement of Berlin was completed. At that time, Hitler already knew that his plan had failed, so he decided to</p>
<p>Self-Destruct</p>
<p>Other well-informed sources believe that the failure of the plan to join forces with the British to destroy Bolshevism prompted his decision to commit suicide. The ideas in his book "Mein Kampf" have not been shaken. Hitler also mentioned this in his speeches after the outbreak of the war. Although some suggested that he should seek peace with the Soviet Union, Hitler refused and had no intention of compromising with Bolshevism. According to reliable sources, Hitler opposed the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, but was eventually persuaded by former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. According to neutral sources, on April 21, Hitler sent Himmler and Dönitz to northern Germany to make</p>
<p>Final Appeal</p>
<p>to England, with the Swedish Red Cross as an intermediary, but this attempt still failed. Thus, his last dream was shattered, and Hitler decided to commit suicide in the hail of bullets in the German Parliament. It is said that Hitler died on May 1, when he had handed over military and political power to Dönitz, but it is clear that Hitler was determined to die in battle. Previously, on September 3, 1939, Hitler had appointed Göring as his first successor and Hess as his second successor. Now Hess has been excluded, and Göring has lost popular support for failing to reorganize the German Air Force to resist the Allied air offensive, so Göring is no longer considered a suitable successor. This is the reason for his resignation. Submarine warfare expert Admiral Dönitz was only a major shortly before the outbreak of the war. He was promoted to admiral within five years and was highly respected by Hitler and other leaders. Although Dönitz was a protector of Hitler, he was not a member of the Nazi Party, which is one of the reasons why he was chosen as Hitler's successor.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Central News Agency) London dispatch: British government authorities announced on the 7th that the remains of Dr. Goebbels, his wife, and children have been found in Berlin. However, the remains of the Führer and Marshal Göring have not yet been found. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow, Soviet soldiers are investigating the bodies found in the Führer's residence, but Hitler's remains have not yet been found.</p>

<h3>Strictly Enforcing Lighting Restrictions to Ensure Citywide Peace: Speech by Li Zhenhuan, Deputy Chief of the Air Defense Section</h3>
<p>Li Zhenhuan, Section Chief of the Air Defense Section of the Police Department, delivered a broadcast speech yesterday from 7:20 PM to 8:00 PM on the importance of lighting restrictions and the method of using gongs as an alternative to air raid sirens, as well as other air defense issues. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>During this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the danger of air raids in this city is also becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, all air defense facilities are urgently needed and brooks no delay. Although the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, and the Police Department have made great efforts to provide guidance and the Baojia Self-Defense Corps has provided assistance in the past, citizens are still indifferent. During air raids, citizens often look up at the sky during the day, like children playing games. The danger is great, not only because of falling bombs that cause casualties, but also because anti-aircraft shells can fall and injure people at any time. Therefore, during the day, when encountering an air raid, people should quickly take refuge in air raid shelters and not watch on the streets to avoid the danger of stray bullets and shrapnel. At night, when encountering an air raid, people must not turn on lights or use candles to avoid becoming a target for bombing. The following points are to be brought to everyone's attention:</p>
<p>Lighting Restrictions</p>
<p>The meaning and importance of lighting restrictions: Attacking aircraft are not easily discovered at night and can easily fly to their destination. The biggest target is lights, especially the lights of large cities that reflect on the sky and can be seen from a distance of one or two hundred miles, making them vulnerable to attack. If the lights can be concealed, so that the incoming aircraft lose their target, this is the purpose of lighting restrictions. If all the lights in the city are concealed, but a very small number of citizens do not comply with the lighting restrictions, then all the citizens will be endangered by air raids. The damage to people's lives and property is not small, so the authorities will severely punish those who do not comply.</p>
<p>Lighting restrictions are divided into three types: 1. Preparatory restrictions: Unnecessary lights for daily life, such as neon lights, door lights, and advertising lights, cannot be used. 2. Alert restrictions: During an alert warning, store lights that are not necessary must not be turned on, otherwise, residential lights must be shielded to prevent light from escaping. 3. Air raid restrictions: All lights must be turned off or shielded, so that no light leaks. It is hoped that citizens will not leak light and pay attention to the following items: 1. Indoor lights must be covered with lampshades. 2. Windows must be covered with black cloth. If there are shutters, the shutters must be closed. 3. The most important thing is skylights, which people usually do not pay attention to, but are very obvious in the sky. From now on, the police will launch a thorough crackdown on lighting restrictions, and it is hoped that citizens will pay attention.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Wells</p>
<p>During air raids, water pipes are sometimes damaged. In the interior, river water is available, but in Shanghai, when tap water is cut off, there is nowhere to get water. There is only one remedy, that is, digging wells. It is hoped that citizens will dig more wells in each Jia [traditional unit of households], for the following purposes: 1. For drinking and eating. 2. For fire fighting (for fighting fires, such as incendiary bombs). 3. For washing (washing clothes and cleaning).</p>
<p>The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has contacted well-digging merchants to ensure that well-digging prices are cheap and the materials used are good, so that citizens can get all kinds of convenience. If you want to know the details, you can go to the Air Defense Headquarters at 280 Fuzhou Road, first floor, opposite the Police Headquarters on the Fourth Road.</p>
<p>In order to anticipate obstacles in reporting, the following two methods will also be used in addition to issuing and lifting alarms: Alert warning (and oral communication): White flag, strike the gong three times each time (each time about five to ten seconds apart). Air raid warning (and oral communication): Red flag, strike the gong ten or more times. Lifting of air raid warning (and oral communication): White flag (same as alert), strike the gong three times each time (each time about five to ten seconds apart). Lifting of alert warning (and oral communication): Team flag, strike the gong two times each time.</p>
<p>If it is a training alarm, a yellow flag must be added to the flag.</p>
<p>The word "training" must also be added when striking the gong, wait for shelter each time strike the gong ten or more times in a row (same as air raid alarm).</p>
<p>The only difference is that the word "wait for shelter" is used in oral communication.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two methods that have been implemented, the authorities are planning various</p>
<p>methods in order to be as perfect as possible.</p>
<p>The word "training" should be added to the oral communication during training.</p>
<p>Building Air Raid Shelters</p>
<p>Air raid shelters are safe places for citizens to take refuge during air raids. Air raid shelters have now been set up in each police sub-bureau area, but some air raid shelters do not have covers, and some air raid shelters are not fully equipped, which is entirely due to economic limitations. When digging in Shanghai to two or three feet, water is discovered, so only semi-underground (that is, one half underground and one half above ground) air raid shelters can be built. Although this type of air raid shelter cannot resist direct hits, it is very effective in avoiding the danger of blasts, shrapnel, and anti-aircraft shells if a bomb falls nearby. It is hoped that citizens will universally build air raid shelters. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters in this city has detailed plans. If citizens want to build air raid shelters, they can inquire at the headquarters.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Obligatory Elementary School Continues to Recruit Students and Textbooks</h3>
<p>The ten obligatory elementary schools established by the Obligatory Education Committee of this newspaper have been in session since last month. On average, each school has about 100 students, and there are still many impoverished children who continue to apply for enrollment. In order to prevent students who are rejected due to full capacity from being out of school, it was decided at the second Obligatory Education Committee meeting to increase the number of students in each school and add classes. Classes are now being opened in order. Regarding the textbooks used by the obligatory school students, there is still a shortage of first, second, third, and fourth grade textbooks for Elementary Chinese Language, General Knowledge, and Arithmetic. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously to complete the project.</p>
<p>A Passionate Heart</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Yibing, the principal of Wude Obligatory Elementary School, came to this office yesterday, stating that the school has been closed, and donated the remaining 31,800 yuan as obligatory school funds. Mr. Xu is dedicated to obligatory education and shares the same goal, dedicating all the remaining funds to support the obligatory schools, and his enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xitian, the principal of Xiude Elementary School, wrote: "Deng Xueli, a fifth-grade student at our school, voluntarily donated 3,000 yuan of candy money saved from her daily expenses for the use of the obligatory schools. Although it is just a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem, her passionate heart is commendable, so I am sending it here and hope you will accept it. I also hope that elementary school students throughout the city will respond to this call, save money, and donate it to the obligatory schools, so that impoverished children will benefit more."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Has Approved the Supplemental Application for Special Allocation of Rice for Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau and the Goods Allocation Office jointly handled the application for special allocation of rice for teachers and staff of public and private schools at all levels in this city last September. The application procedure for this item has already been closed. However, there are still some schools that failed to apply and get approval on time due to incomplete procedures or the principal leaving Shanghai. It is heard that Director Dai of the Education Bureau, considering the difficult living conditions of the staff of the above-mentioned schools, specially reported the situation to the Municipal Government, ordering them to submit the list of names for verification. The bureau is now rushing to produce various application forms and styles, notifying the schools to submit the application within the 10th to 24th of this month. Those who have previously submitted a supplementary application but have not yet been approved must also fill in the new forms again in order to ensure uniformity and facilitate issuance. Furthermore, in the future, when there are changes in the staff of each school, the prescribed forms should be requested from the Education Bureau for investigation and reporting, in order to be verified and handled.</p>
<p>Application Method</p>
<p>Schools that do not comply with the order of the Ministry and charge students for rice or use the converted value of rice as tuition fees shall not apply.</p>
<p>For schools applying for special allocation of rice, the school shall purchase an application form from the Shanghai Special City Goods Allocation Office, fill it out according to the format, and then create a master list of all teachers and staff as stipulated by the Education Bureau, as well as a survey form for the application for special allocation of rice, in triplicate each, and a general survey form for the school as stipulated by the Education Bureau, in one copy each, and submit them to the Education Bureau for review. After review and approval, the application form and the master list of employees will be stamped with the "Verified and Approved" seal or the "Provisionally Approved Allocation" seal. The Education Bureau will submit the application form, the master list of employees, and two copies each of the survey form for the application for special allocation of rice to the Municipal Government for approval. After approval by the Municipal Government, the application form and the list and forms will be ordered to the Goods Allocation Office for allocation, and the Education Bureau will instruct the applying schools to go to the Goods Allocation Office to collect the allocation certificate.</p>
<p>If the schools applying for special allocation of rice are combined from universities, middle schools, and primary schools, the survey form for the school should be filled out separately, and all application forms and master lists of employees for the application for special allocation of rice should be combined.</p>
<p>For schools applying for special rice, the number of teachers and staff shall not exceed the standard for the number of staff in the school as stipulated by the Education Bureau. If the number of staff already approved is requested to be increased, an application form must be attached with a written explanation of the reasons, and submitted to the Education Bureau for review and then submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and the Goods Allocation Office will be instructed to increase the allocation quota.</p>
<p>Those who have been approved for allocation for the first time and are applying for subsequent periods must still follow the provisions of Article 2 of this method. If there are increases, decreases, or changes in the number of teachers and staff, the reason for the change must be clearly stated in the "Registration" column of the master list of employees. If a teacher or staff member resigns midway and is not replaced, the school shall directly return the surplus allocation coupons and report the number and quantity of the returned coupons in triplicate to the Education Bureau for verification and the Municipal Government for the Goods Allocation Office to record.</p>
<p>If the allocation certificate has been received and a staff member resigns midway and is replaced by someone else, the applying school shall fill out a staff change report in triplicate and submit it to the Education Bureau for verification and the Municipal Government, and inform the Goods Allocation Office.</p>
<p>Teachers and staff who also work at other schools should be identified as applying for allocation at one school. Those who do not receive rice at that school shall not fill out the application.</p>
<p>After the principal of each school receives the special rice allocation coupons for all staff members, they should be properly kept and issued to the staff members monthly and on time. They shall not be issued in advance to avoid shortages of allocation certificates due to staff changes or new and old coupons. They shall not intentionally withhold or hide the allocation certificates that should be issued on time.</p>
<p>If the school has agreed with the teachers and staff to provide meals, they shall not withhold the allocation certificates that the staff members are entitled to receive.</p>
<p>Anyone who falsifies names or falsely reports the number of people, intending to fraudulently receive more allocation certificates, or violates any of the provisions of Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of this method, once verified, in addition to the penalty methods separately stipulated by the Goods Allocation Office, the Education Bureau shall impose a penalty based on the circumstances, and if the circumstances are serious, it shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for verification and handling.</p>
<p>The Goods Allocation Office or the Education Bureau may, when necessary, send personnel to investigate whether the names and numbers of teachers and staff members who receive special allocation of rice at each school are in compliance, and the situation of issuing allocation certificates.</p>

<h3>Education Bureau Holds Talk Meeting with Vocational School Principals to Discuss Rectifying School Spirit and Other Issues</h3>

First, Director Dai reported the purpose of convening the talk meeting and raised issues such as rectifying school spirit, school registration, school evacuation, and rice allocation, and provided a written opinion. The principals of each school expressed their opinions and conducted detailed discussions separately. Finally, Director Dai summarized the opinions of all parties and drew conclusions, stating briefly: Regarding the issue of school spirit, during this period of serious situation, the mission of university students is extremely important. Each school should actively provide guidance to make them aware of their thoughts and respectful in their lives, and promote various legitimate entertainments, such as sports, music, and art activities, so that they can move towards the right track. Regarding academic aspects, they should also step up supervision and improve standards. On the one hand, schools should conduct investigations and punishments at any time and notify parents to pay attention. On the other hand, relevant agencies should conduct strict investigations and crackdowns. Regarding the issue of registration, as the case involves legal procedures, each school should prepare separately so that it can be handled in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry. Issues such as evacuation were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned after 6 o'clock.</p>
