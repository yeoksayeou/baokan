<h3>印主席鮑斯　新年祝辭</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　印度自由臨時政府主席鮑斯，四日下午七時二十分，向大東亞各地廣播新年祝辭，並披瀝印人驅逐英人及爭取自由之決心，其要旨如次：大東亞戰爭爲拂護正義及自由而戰，吾人爲達成政治獨立及經濟解放，不惜一切，從事參加戰爭。吾人爲恢復天賦之自由，若不能利用此絕妙機會，則將來必飽受政治及經濟之壓迫，且將淪入繼承英帝國主義之美國桎梏。似今次大規模之戰爭，自屬摧毀現代世界之基礎，爲推翻舊秩序，自應發生長期耐苦之鬥爭，吾等印度人民，已充分了解自身應負責任之重大及國難，更體騐英帝國主義之實力及狡猾，然吾人不能否認英帝國主義獲得美國及其他聯合國之支持不易覆滅之事，此吾人瞭解英帝國內部之腐敗，相信印度今日之力量及同盟國之戰力，更相信最後之勝利。一九四四年二月四日，印度國民軍（即印度解放軍）所期待之戰爭，現於緬甸之阿拉坎圻區與英國及其他協約國作戰，目下在印緬國境及印度領內諸地。逐步擴大印度獨立戰爭，今日自由之印人，於此可慶祝新年，誓將英人全部逐出印度國土。</p>

<p>代論</p>
<h3>澄清史治的試金石</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>上海特別市諮詢委員會等五團體，昨日爲歡迎陳代主席，舉行茶會，本人參與共間，曾發表演詞，移載於次：</p>
<p>今天上海各團體歡迎陳代主席，一而對代主席過去在上海的政績表示感謝，一面對代主席今後的抱負，表示熱望，剛才李贊侯光生已說得很明白。本人願以一個國民的地位乘機說幾句話。</p>
<p>目前整個和平區的一般實況，毋庸諱言的不能盡如人意。而另一方面，目前時局的要求，又是怎樣的緊急與迫切。所以，目前現狀決不能適應時局要求。這是極度危險的現象。</p>
<p>爲什麽和平區內形成道樣危險的現象呢？總括的說，由於政治力量的不够，當然，這是由來已久，逐漸形成的。這些現象，我們相信富局已經嚴密注意，決心振肅。這在陳代主席負責中樞以後的屢次訓詞中可以窺測。例如陳代主席在去年就職及今年元旦訓詞裏提示的要點中：第三點說「決意澄清吏治」。第五點說「在政則崇尙廉潔，實行建設，不祇需要沈毅，更需要邁進」。都是針對政治革新的提示。</p>
<p>我們一向主張革新政治，實際上就是澄淸吏治。我們認爲目前政治上有兩個大敵，一個是官塲方面的貪污，一個是社會上的暴利。如果這兩個大敵不予澈底剷除，則政治永不淸明，物價永不能平。澄淸吏治常然是一件大工作。不過，現在可以從最小的兩件事的能否做到，作爲今後能否澄淸吏治的試金石。第一件是嚴禁各地軍警的勒索，試想勒索是什麽行爲？如果不是穿了國家制服的人而實施革索時，這是什麽行爲？從前的釐金，莫不認爲最擾民的苛政，但有了決心終予裁廢了。現在勒索的擾民，更十百倍於釐金。如果政府能有決心，集中力量先把勒索現象肅淸，也非難事。這一件事假定三個月爲肅淸期。第二件是取締車站上類似黑帽子的跋扈。黑帽子不過是車站上的小僕役，難道政治的力量就不及黑帽子的力量不成？雖然，這是華中鐵道的職工，應由華中鐵道負責的，可是，華中鐵道沒有能力去取締的時候，那末，我們政府就不能坐視，應起而干涉取締。京滬京平道上往來的政府官吏，誰不親目所睹，焉有不感可惡之理。這一件事假定以一月爲取締期。如果這兩件小事，一個月做不到，三個月做不到，那末，其餘一切的澄清吏治，革新政治工作，都將成爲空談了。</p>
<p>其次，陳代主席又說，今日生產已漸停頓，無可諱言，今後必使軍需民需雙方並重，以鼓勵人民致力於生產之繼續。我們很佩服這種觀察與判斷的準確。我國的參戰，實際上祇能偏於經濟方面的協力，所以必須側重生產。和平區內的三省兩市是最富庶的地區，而現巳達於生產停滯地步，實在說不過去，如果因爲運輸的不便，因爲統制經濟中若干不合理措施的障礙，就應該與盟邦有關當局硏究利害關係，以全部力量打破這個難關。目前最大問題是農業的減產。所以，希望農業增產，最主要的是解除農民疾苦，同時，給予日常生活所用的物資，爲了這些物資的來源，就須重視輕工業生產，農工配合生產原是循環之理。希望政府從速頒布鼓勵農民增產的實施辦法，對於一切工業生產，應有統盤計劃，一半工業轉變爲軍需，實踐參戰中經濟上協力的任務。一半用之民需，並以大部分生產物資流通農村，交換農產，這探，才能達到鼓勵人民致力生產之繼續的目的。</p>
<p>我們需要的政治領袖，是公正的，博大的，深信陳代主席是兼而有之，更不勝表示熱烈的期望。</p>
<h3>空襲台灣琉球　敵美戰意低落　鹽田大慰談太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬陸海外三當局主持之聯合報道常會，昨下午三時假南京路外灘匯中飯店五樓舉行。艦隊報道部計到鹽田大尉，囑託林俊夫，王炳南，劉鎭南等，即席由鹽田大尉代表松島部長發表談話，闡明敵美在太平洋菲島方面之焦慮苦悶，尤其最近空襲台灣琉球戰意低落，此外並對美國人的資源頗感枯竭，有所說明。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>空襲台灣戰意薄弱</p>
<p>美軍鍳於菲律寶作戰，毫無進展，焦急結果，遂於四日用艦載機及陸上機，向台灣及琉球方面施行空襲。此次空襲與去年十月間空襲比較，數量上已減少的很多，而攻擊方法，亦非常低劣，好像習作戰一樣，因此我方重要設施，絲毫未受損害。此次空襲最顯著之現象，爲敵方戰意薄弱，故吾人想像此次參加作戰之飛機，多爲訓練不够之飛行隊，以上係指艦載機而言，至陸上機未拋炸彈即倉皇而逃。由此觀之，敵此舉不過　嚇手段而已。</p>
<p>今後戰局情重要</p>
<p>當然敵方作戰目的，希望空襲台灣，遮斷菲律賓補給路綫，同時在帕勞島方面美海軍及運輸船團之動向，此次作戰爲預備下一次作戰之準備工作。至下一次作戰敵是否到呂宋島或其他地點去，須情形轉變如何始能斷定。敵方希望此時打開現在戰局，今後戰局情勢非常重要。其次關於英國方面，英太平洋艦隊對此方作戰，究竟如何協力，尙難確定，但無論從各方面說，菲律賓戰綫從新年開始，即已激烈化，日方在進行作戰準備中，今後在菲島作戰上常繼續有大出血戰果，諸位可以期待。</p>
<p>菲島人心極爲安定</p>
<p>鹽由大尉代表松島部長談話畢，復談關於菲律賓戰綫情形稱，據最近從菲律賓來人談，菲島雖常受敵方轟炸，但人心仍極安定，當然物資不如以前豐富，物價亦相當高，而民心並不動搖，尤其敵在雷伊泰島登陸後，一般人民非特不動搖，並踴躍協助日軍作戰。據麥克沃塞司令部發出對一般人民警告稱：倘有幫助日軍的菲人，決予全部格殺云云。本來敵此次對菲作戰，第一個計劃，即預算菲人能幫助他們的忙，而結果適得其反，故敵方一怒而發此命令。在菲律賓的日人，士氣旺盛，與日軍完全一致。菲律賓當地生產，已達到相當程度，如兵器方面當地亦可修理。</p>
<p>敵英艦隊無力作戰</p>
<p>此外關於敵英茀拉塞將軍所稱：英太平洋艦隊雖服從英政府命令，惟在太平洋上作戰，須從敵美之指揮，而在實力方面，亦須平衡，不得超越美艦隊之上。昨日敵所發表新聞稱：英太平洋艦隊與後第七艦隊之聯繫，指明英太平洋艦隊担負保護澳洲方面之補給路綫任務，是以判斷英艦隊決不敢向日軍艦隊作戰，且又無龐大武力。今日軍新銳飛機即將出現，超越敵美機之上，速度迅速，而敵美之轟炸機B2429型戰鬥機p51型生產驟減，每月平均減少一千架以上，其原因實由於勞動力之不敷，敵美爲解決人的資源，保護兵力，不惜將後方生產人力減　少，以機器代替增產。據前美生產局動員局發表，猶對一般國民誇　生產力之龐大，最困難者則爲人力不之不足，深望人民協力，否則在對日作戰，難以勝利。査美自開戰以來，頗少發表此類談話，今因將人的資源全部驅赴前綫，甘言巧騙。又據昨日德國新聞社發表，美國抽調十八歲至二十八歲之農夫服徵兵役，對于本國人的資源之苦悶，深爲迫切，而日本則對人的資源，今已派遣國外之陸海軍尙未及半，可見日軍之威強。</p>
<h3>日閣議通過　增稅案要綱</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日政府曾愼重檢討明年度之租稅政策，首先檢討二百二十二億四千四百萬元之明年度一般會計預算及最近決定之臨時軍事費特別會計追加預算之歲出狀况，同時，爲加强戰時財政，並吸收一般浮動購員力，故決定實行年然十八億元之增稅方針，此於四日之閣議中，已通過增稅案要綱。至該項內容，則已决第於五日發表，關於增稅案要綱待案文整理後，於二十二日之閣議中附議，即正式通過爲法律要綱，此次增稅之對象，係將分類所得稅法，人稅特別法，人稅等作爲直接稅，而將酒稅，通稅等作爲間接稅。</p>
<h3>本年撥發合作社　增產補助費綱要</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　行政院農業增產策進委員會，爲期本年度迅速撥發農業增產補助費，充分發揮合作社之機能，以推動增產工作起見，特擬定「三十四年度撥發合作社農業增產補助費綱要」，並經該　會體委員會通過頒怖實行，該　綱要內容包括：</p>

<p>（六）合作社對輔助費之使用，該　會及有關機關可隨時聯絡派員審核。</p>
<h3>新民會　召開會議</h3>
<p>北平五日中央社電　新民會中央總會爲處理民國三十三年度全體聯合協議會議案，並硏討實踐方案，以達成後方基地華北所負之增產運使命起見，特於今（五）日下午在該會召開會議，討論關於議案之處理方策，屆時計出席主席委員綏請總署羅寶春參事等各關係代表共三十餘人，開會後，首由主席委員羅寳春參事致開會詞，對於社會建設議案第十四號，擬請加强民衆組織，施行嚴格訓練，確立剿共體制，安定民生案及十五項擬請政府普遍救濟災民，以維社會秩序而利建設案兩案，日出席各關係人員相互交換意見，對於實踐之種種方案，討論頗詳，同時並協商臨時動議第十四。十五兩項議案。會議歷三小時許，始行散會。</p>

<p>南京五日中央社電　日本大使館情報部長岸偉一氏，日前因公赴漢，業於元旦返京，日昨於官邸接見記者團，就轟炸下之漢口僑民防空情形發表觀感如次：敵機盲炸下之漢口日僑，於中野總領事及各官員指導下，積極從事復興工作，精神至令人感佩，當地日本陸海軍當局復隨時予以便利及協助，尤爲令人感謝。在十二月十八日之空襲中，日僑死傷極少，其主要原因，即由於防空設備之完善與平素訓練之充分所致，雖於盲炸之後均仍能沉着應付，與練習時無異，吾人於此深感有組織之防空，實爲防空工作中之最重要工作，尤其各地防空壕之設備，今後甚希能得進步之改善。</p>
<h3>第一方面軍　司令部移蘇州　各軍師部仍駐原防</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　第一方面軍總司令任援道氏，自兼任江蘇省長曁駐蘇州綏靖主任以後，力謀全省之軍政一元化，刻因第一方面軍司令部原設南京，茲爲便利指揮辦公起見，特將第一方面軍總司令部移於蘇州。至於所勝各軍師部，仍駐原來防地，並不變更，並爲與中樞各關係機關便利連絡，時在總司令部原址，設立第一方面軍總司令部駐京辦事處，聞該司令部辦事處處長人選，近日內亦可正式發表云。</p>
<h3>孫良誠部　移防蘇北</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）蘇北綏靖主任兼第二方面軍總司令孫良誠將軍，奉令移防，親率健兒由豫抵抵泰，沿途掃蕩匪軍安物人民，在興亞保華之堅强信念下，完成移防任務。昨據蘇北來人談，孫總司令抵蘇後，與駐蘇之第二十六師師畏陳才福及第三十八師師長孫玉田會師鹽城，備受該地民衆之熱烈歡迎，當孫部沿隴海綫整師開入蘇北時，曾在阜寗響水江附近，與匪共老八路主力部隊四國發生激烈之遭遇戰因將士用命，卒將匪部全數擊潰，斬獲無算，蘇北匪共實力，經此一擊，已成强弩之末，被脅從民兵均紛紛悔悟，先後夾歸，官兵將民兵之響導，分頭肅淸，剿撫兼施，使地據點起見，特偕同駐蘇八年之陳才福將軍，分赴伍估釗莊，東台，海州，泰州等處視察，兼査訪民情，備受當地民衆之熱烈歡迎，並出席民衆大會，宣慰各地民衆，自力奉行國策，以期軍民一體完逐參戰目的，實踐汪故主席遺志。</p>
<h3>蘇軍大砲轟擊　轉攻洪京益急　德軍仍堅守地下要塞</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　蘇軍據守布達佩斯周圍高地，一日起向德軍據點以噴射式大砲轟射。據路透社莫斯科電：德軍陣地置於高大建築之地下室，並以深溝取得聯絡，堪稱地下要塞，蘇軍之猛烈砲擊似未奏效。蘇軍繼續增强炸力，三日已佔據該市西方布達地區至多瑙河西岸之米多羅斯霍梅第及馬星加利太橋，該市上空德空軍不斷攻擊蘇軍之糧給錢，並自二日起將蘇軍包圍下之德軍據點，開始空中補給。</p>
<p>德軍保持主動地位</p>
<p>柏林五日順央社電　海通社訊；倫台特元帥自於去年十二月十六日奪得主動地位後，今仍保持此優勢。今西綫戰祝可分下列五點述之：（一）德軍在摩塞爾與繆斯河間之攻勢，已將美第一軍加以分散。（二）艾森霍華遂不得不將薩爾前綫巴頓將軍之第二軍，急調至比利時境內缺口處應戰，藉以保護反軸心軍北翼所受之威脅，故德軍在薩爾前綫所受之威脅今已解除。（三）美第七軍亦不得不接取前爲美第三軍所守之戰綫，巴拉托納迤南之美軍及第七軍，遂被迫退出在馬奇諾防綫及德國西牆外圍以重大代價奪得之地，（四）德國西牆防務遠較敵軍之想像爲堅强，故德軍能發動反攻，遏阻其進展，（五）德軍士氣旺盛，幷在軍備生產方面亦已取得平衡，故戰局遂有利於德軍。</p>
<h3>義境反軸心軍　爲波河平原</h3>
<p>出動兵力二十師</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　爲爭奪軍事要地波河平原計，反軸心軍出動軍隊二十師之多，反軸心軍地中海區總司令企圖逐漸衝過阿平寗山谷，直逼波原之西南隅，敵兵在該方雖已出動大隊坦克車及軍械，尙未能完成包圍之情勢，德軍將領應付有方，敵多次進犯皆未能逞。</p>
<h3>蘇聯或將承認　波臨時政府</h3>
<p>英美能度堪注目</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　海通社訊，莫斯科消息：蘇外委長莫洛托夫昨曾接見「洪牙利臨時政府」代表團領袖李昻哥齊</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　德國社訊：據瑞京日報論稱：倫敦方面雖曾希望蘇聯在反軸心三國會議討論波蘭問題之前，勿承認廬布林之波蘭政府，但如果烏克蘭折俄羅斯及拉脫維亞蘇維埃共和國等業巳承認廬布林政府，則蘇聯對該政府之承認，亦僅時間問題。</p>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　德國社訊，據倫敦消息：由前任總理米柯拉席克所領導之波蘭農民黨發表宣言稱，英美法若果承認盧布林委員會，其意無異核准共產主義波蘭之成立，共產主義之波蘭不久將併入蘇聯，而在英美法同意之下，毀滅其獨立自由與實力。</p>
<h3>英保守黨大會　展期舉行</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　海通社引倫敦消息：英保守黨原訂於一月二十九日至三十一日舉行大會，今則展期至三月十四日至十五日舉行，此訊極引起政界人士之騷動。有謂羅斯福邱吉爾斯達林將於本月杪舉行會談，倘不改期則邱吉爾與艾登皆將無法參加此項大會。</p>

<h3>首都的決戰政治與新年</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　澹明</p>
<p>民國三十四年，是軸心與反軸心兩大陣容間最後決戰的一年，所以在跨入於今年的元旦那一天，就可以看到國人無論朝野都表現出一種沉毅的新精神。尤其在我國的首都，雖然在晴日當空的天際飄揚着燦爛的國旗，可是全市人民莫不在忍着艱苦的生活而對國府的決戰政治深表期待。</p>
<p>簡單的國府慶典</p>
<p>國民政府照例在元旦的一天，要在國府大禮堂集合全國高等文武官員舉行慶典。他們雖沒有像盟邦在華機關一樣停止賀年舉動，但是那一天所舉行的慶典也是非常簡單。只由陳代主席把擬定的元旦訓示朗讀一遍，陳氏的面容顯見得略較蒼老，在他沉着的舉步中可以看出他對我國未來的運命正作着勇敢的打算。他自從汪主席逝世後，一直秉着國必統一黨不可分的堅志，繼承着過去一貫的政策，這實在是値得我們欽佩的。因爲是決戰的一年，元旦慶典就在簡單和肅穆空氣中完畢，大槪僅有二三十分鐘吧。那天去的新聞記者特別少，尤其出乎意外的，我國報社和通訊社的記都沒有去，日本記者也未見前去，而視爲例外的只有記者和新申報的一位駐京特派員以及兩位德國通訊社的記者。同時每年在舉行元旦慶典的時候，除了新聞記者之外，往往還有電影公司的攝影大員以及報社的攝影記者，此次也沒有看見他們的踪跡。</p>
<p>可紀念的寗遠樓</p>
<p>旣然到了國民政府，就和幾位熟識的官吏談談，才知道行政院就在國府大禮堂的後面。自陳代主席兼任該院院長之後，現在已佈置了一間院長辦公室。因爲以前汪主席是在他公館中辦公的，所以還沒有這樣一間辦公室哩。可是在這間院長辦公室佈置好以前！陳代主席往常在寗遠樓接見要人，同時行政院會議與最高國防會議也由汪主席公館改到這裏舉行。原來寗遠樓便在外交部後面，過去本是國府招待外賓之所，尤其値得紀念的便是國府還都後對盟邦一切條約之簽訂都在那裏舉行。記者在那裏徘徊了好久，想起汪故主席生前轟轟烈烈的偉業，正有桃花人面之感！國府大禮堂之右側，本來就是立法院，可是爲了人事異動之故，今亦改爲監察院了！</p>
<p>人事異動中的沉寂</p>
<p>在新年中滯留於首都，這一次特別感到寂寞。國府所有要人大都到上海去了，雖然各機關僅休假一日。聽說陳代主席爲了市府交代也將去滬一行，而且隨着上海市府人事的異動，一般宦海逐鹿者也便大都以上海爲目標了。以本京來說，在此次行政院局部的人事異動上，像宣傳部換了部長，可是因爲林部長調任安徽省長之故，原有人員據說也將隨行，所以在新部長尙未到任之前，首都的空氣是愈顯得沉靜了！不曉得在這樣人事異動中，能否使我國政治更走上淸明的階段。以前當陳代主席去接收上海市府的時候，據說所有公家汽車會被開走一空的，過了二三年或許已有了進步了吧！記者旣是報人，當然更關心未來的宣傳事業。如果今日隨着中國新聞協會之成立而有了報人新的團結，那末新的宣傳當局就應該在這個決戰關頭盡其新的宣傳使命</p>
<p>鄕村自治的新建設</p>
<p>無意間在街頭碰劉了過去的一位學生，他現在溧水任某區區長，從他口中聽到了許多關於「新四熾」的事。「新四軍」是被稱爲匪軍的，可是實際都是受了官逼民反的影響。現在凡有此項「匪軍」的地方，據說倒也相安無事，可是對於一般借公濟私的不法還輸，則莫不一致起而捉拿。從這一點看起來，國府治下地方的不法官吏，他們今天實際上只受着「匪軍」的制裁，這實在不得不使人痛心的。聽說，陳代主席自從盟邦回京之後，已鼓起了他澄淸吏治的決心。他的做法是先從整理鄕鎭地方行政與自治團體入手。現在國府對於鄉鎭的保用制度，將有新的規畫，且將頒布統一的法規。鄕村的建設，將從自衛自治自給的三種辦法中開始。如果我國迅速能建立起了這樣負有三項使命的壯丁隊，記者深信匪患也許就可以減少許多了。此外，我們現在只有一件事，還待努力的便是貨幣須與生產相聯繫，否則通貨繼續增發的結果，前途是相當危險的。因爲國府公務員的待遇，不久又將改善，然而此種治標之法究非根本辦法，其唯一救濟的方法恐舍採生產本位之外無它良策了。新年在首都雖然沉寂，但其新的努力之光却已逐漸在顯現出來，我們希望陳代主席及其同志，放着胆做去吧！（一月二日寄自南京）堆積如山的日本砲彈生產</p>

<h3>五團體舉行茶會　歡迎陳代主席　陳氏訓詞期勉發揚爲國忘己精神</h3>
<p>本市諮詢委員會，市商會，市民福利恊會，中國新聞恊會上海區分會，上海慈善團等團體，以陳代主席長滬西四年，勞苦功高，此次因公蒞滬，特聯合於昨（五）日下午四時假長樂路華懋公寓，舉行歡迎茶會，計到有國府高級長官，市府各局處長，各界領袖，丁獸邨·丁福保·尤懷畢·王懷廉·王海波·王式園·王伯元·甘斗南·朱孔嘉·朱博泉·何五良·何焯賢·李守黑·李祖虁·沈長庚·沈嗣良·汪嘯水·周毓英·周邦俊·邵式軍·邵樹華·金雄白·帥伯春·林柏生·吳藧齋·吳庸庵·吳頌皋·吳凱聲·吳國璋·胡詒毅·姜西園·孫理甫·孫仲立·殷子白·徐補孫·徐天深·徐鐵珊·馬潤芳·袁厚之·袁濬昌·章駿·陳紹嬀·陳亞夫·陳中孚·陳日平·陳伯藩·張恩麟·張素民·張德欽·黃敬齊·黃宣平·黃雨齋·許力求·許冠羣·許曉初·馮炳南·項康原·楊無生·黃滌生·葉扶　·劉仰山·劉靖基·趙正平·熊劍東·裴雲卿·廖家楠·潘炳臣·魯風·戴靄盧·戴英夫·魏善甫·羅訥齋·蘇成德·顧毓崎·顧南羣·等四百餘人，由五團體代表李思浩·聞蘭亭·袁履登·林康侯·陳彬龢等殷勤招待。禮堂佈置簡單嚴肅，中懸國旗兩面，並由各團體呈獻「滬民愛戴」四字銀杯一座，陳列主席檯前。四時正，陳代主席翩然蒞止，行禮如儀，首由大會主席李思浩致歡迎詞，旋由主席團呈獻紀念杯，繼由陳代主席致訓詞，辭意懇切激勵，語多勗勉，聽者深爲感動，一時掌聲如雷。後由主席團代表陳彬龢演說，末進茶點，至五時許，始在熱烈空氣中散會。</p>

<p>主席詞</p>
<p>陳代主席，諸位長官，諸位來賓，今天本市諮詞委員會，市商會，市民福利恊會，慈善團，新聞協會區分會等團體，以陳代主席蒞滬，舉行茶會歡迎，承蒙光臨，很爲榮幸。陳代主席在上海市長任內，歷時四載，對於復與上海建設備極艱辛，尤以交涉接收租借，完成市政統一爲政績中最光榮的一頁，我們站在上海市民立塲，表示無限感謝。現在陳代主席卸去本市市長職務，我們固有惜別之意，但是今後出主中樞，責任更鉅，而督導本市建設，也必更爲積極。我們希望陳代主席今後本其爲國忠誠的抱負，與民更始，革新政治，而以增加生產，安定民生，確立治安爲入手方法，　使政治逐漸走上軌道，敬祝陳代主席身體康健，勛業日隆，國家幸甚。</p>
<p>陳代主</p>
<p>席訓詞</p>
<p>旋由陳代主席致訓詞，詞意懇切。首對各團體隆重招待，表示感謝。繼謂：幾年以來，所做之工作無多大成功。對國家無絲毫貢獻，旣無補於國家，亦無助於汪先生。中間提到近十年來，汪先生「爲國忘己」「有國無我」的精神時，陳氏熱淚盈眶，聽者極爲感動。末謂：「在滬四年有餘，自始即抱定宗旨，只求有功，不妨有過，但四年以來功未見有，而過却很多，深自慚愧。雖各位能予原諒，而我自己不能原諒。今後時局日趨嚴重，能否完成各位的期望，不敢言把握。但願遵從汪先生「爲國忘己」「有國無我」的精神，繼承未竟之志，只要中國能實現和平統一，本人則不辭艱難，不惜犧牲，這點我可以負責告訴各位，告訴全滬市民，乃至於全國四萬萬五千萬同胞的。」</p>

<h3>週轉不靈銀行　停止票據交換　與整理金融毫無影響</h3>
<p>本市金融機關業務，自經財政部頒布綱要，實施强化以來，一般內容組織不健全之金融機關，大受打擊，紛紛設法增足資本金額，及吸收存款，充實準備，以謀適合政府强化法令之規定。但間有數家金融機關，不獨無法增資，且吸收存款，亦感不易，故頓呈週轉不靈，無法應付營業。去年度營業決算，各金融機關辦理完竣休假期滿復業後，除江海銀行因無意繼續經營，自動宣佈清理外，近有某某三家銀行，因頭寸未能圓滑運用，銀行公會票據交換所爲維持大衆同業業務利權計，已停止其票據交換，此項銀行停止票據交換，係各該行自無善術運用業務資金，而發生此種不良現象，與整個金融毫無牽制影響，反能增進正當金融機關信仰，惟預料在强化政策尚未完成任務前，有多數不正當之金融機關，仍有同樣情事發現。</p>

<h3>中國新聞恊會　上海區分會成立　前新聞聯合會宣告結束</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會業已組織成立，並自元旦日起開始辦公。辦公處在大上海路一六〇號前新聞聯合會址。該會定於今日下午四時假座南京路華懋飯店舉行茶會，招待各界，宣告成立。同時，前上海新聞聯合會宣告結束。並分別發表宣言如次：</p>
<p>上海新聞聯合會結束宣言</p>
<p>本會成立於民國三十二年一月二十七日，迄今將及兩載。兩年前本市中日各報社共同感覺，爲克盡新聞事業應負的使命，强化新聞事業團結的力量，實有齊一步驟，聯合策進之必要，爰特籌組本會。成立之日，首先搗藥，以宣揚大東亞主義和中日兩國國策，研究新聞事業之發展及發揮其性能，達成新聞事業爲時代先驅的使命爲本會宗旨，同時，也即懸此爲工作方向。兩年以來，承蒙中日主管當局的切實指導，各界人士的熱忱愛護，同業諸君的努力恊助，尤其在各報社推定參加本會負責同仁的融洽合作之下，本會工作得以不斷推進。這在表示感謝之餘，差堪欣幸的。</p>
<p>我們試加檢討兩年間的工作經過，以與所搗藥的宗旨，兩相比衡，不無愧疚之處。對於大東亞主義以及中日兩國國策之宣揚，雖曾有相當努力，祗以棉力有限，未能悉副期望。而於新聞事業之研究發展，殊覺未盡什一之力，更不敢言時代先驅。雖爲人力物力不足運用之環境所限，但就新聞事業的整個使命而言，實有排除艱阻，積極推進之必要。茲者中國新聞協會上海區分會，在發展整個中國新聞事業之任務下，籌組成立，而本會之設，原爲適應當時當地之需要，與新聞協會工作正同，目標一致，爰即決定結束。本會各報社同人繼續參加協會，以求實現本會未竟事業。謹此宣言。</p>
<p>中國新聞協</p>
<p>會上海區分</p>
<p>會成立宣言</p>
<p>中國新聞協會，成立於三十三年九月二十五日，會章規定在各重要地區設立分會，本會爰即根據會章籌組成立。兩年前本市新聞界爲謀聯合推進新聞事業之使命，已有上海新聞聯合會之組織，正與本會使命相同，工作一致，是以，本會之始基實早已奠立，今後在總會指導之下，自當更求充實。</p>
<p>中國新聞協會成立之際，已有宣言公告，工作與使命大致闡釋，茲不贅述。不過，上海爲全國文化教育的中心，尤爲全國新聞事業最發達之區，過去各自爲政，未能收分工合作之效，未能形成輿論中心力量。迨新聞聯合會成立，始具齊一步驟的規模。現在本會正式成立，一面繼續新聞聯合會未竟事業，一面遵照新聞恊會的指示，推進工作。其次在此大東亞戰爭決戰時期，對於決戰宣傳的重點，尤須特別注意。第一，强調大東亞戰爭對於東亞各國生死存亡的重要關係，勝則共存，敗則偕亡，從而喚起國民決戰情緒，堅定必勝信念。第二，要求政府重視民間輿論，而輿論宣傳的背後，自當以大衆利益爲基點，如於國家有利，民生有利，則宣揚頌譽。如於國家有害，民生有害，則不辭諍諫。而於政治上的貪污，社會上的投機暴利，囤積居奇，只顧私利不顧大衆的畸形現象，則視爲衆矢之的，羣起揭露，使無所遁避。總之，振聾發聵，揭奸露宄，導社會於正軌，期政治於清明，增厚國力，進而貢獻與大東亞戰爭，是爲本會工作的總方向，敬祈各界賢達進而教之，謹此宣言。</p>

<h3>本市計政中心問題</h3>
<p>— 顧國棟</p>
<p>本市市政府總會計處，於三十一年七月成立，兩載以來，成績斐然。惟於一八兩區合併於市府以後，本年度開始諸多計政事項，急待推進，爰列舉本市計政中心問題數點如下：</p>
<p>（一）本市總預算之編製</p>
<p>本市自接收租界，更於上年二月一日一八兩區合併，八月一日一區併入市府，市政已臻一元化，關於會計事宜該時以年度未終，而依據一八兩區過去實際情形各因其舊慣而有顯著之不同，一時未能泥沒其跡象而合併。但本年度編製全市總預算自應統一以一個收支總預算爲原則，不應復以依據舊慣而分割全市預算爲「舊一區」「舊八區」「舊市區」三部份，以致全市收支不能統籌量入爲出。因之市屬各機關之薪津待遇遇亦以三部份收支情形不同而有厚薄之差別，殊爲不適。蓋政府預算爲施政張本，故有健全之預算始可施行良好之市政。</p>
<p>（二）本市會計制度之確立</p>
<p>總會計處成立之際，曾頒訂「上海市政府會計規程」但經歷次修訂已失時效，自應重行訂定，以確定市屬各級機關計政實施之依據。且一八區合併以後三部份預算而分三部份帳册，其中「舊八區」「舊市區」依市區會計規程辦理。「舊一區」則沿用舊工部局會計制度。以致全市計政事務分歧。今後希望釐定各機關之會計制度之設計與設置而重行訂定「會計規程」。</p>
<p>（三）充實本市計政人員</p>
<p>總會計處一下至各級單位機關主辦會計人員暨佐理會計人員，很少有專門人材，應廢除任用人員沿習官塲舊例，採用同鄕或舊部的原則，以致減少行政效力，甚至帳務條理不能清晰，計政推行不能順利，計政職權不能厲行。今後希望總會計處內部及各機關主辦及佐理會計人員盡量任用具有會計學識人員，如以人材缺乏，不妨公開徵儲備用。並制定主計人員任用條例，强化人事管理。</p>
<p>（四）健全本市計政機構</p>
<p>總會計處內部現今設科未能以事務之別分設，各科或以「舊一區」「舊八區」「舊市區」之職限而分劃。欲求機構健全，並施行聯綜組織採取內部牽制制度，應以會計歲計統計審計及稽查等事務局分設各科。此外並設專員視察等室。專員以責成計政之研究及特殊交辦事項。視察以督導市屬各機關會計及就地審計事宜以期策進，而克增進計政工作效能。</p>
<p>以上數節，不過舉其犖犖大端。均屬關係本市計政中心問題。舉凡本市收支能量入爲出統一而集中，使之調協而公允，各種經費之核定支付導之合法而合理，一切人事地物之統計求其詳備與正確，使各種事業之興舉權衡其緩急先後之序，以決其輕重損益事宜，不致公幣虛糜。對於預算編製詳確，會計制度健立，會計人員充實，會計機構健全實爲當前本市計政之急務。願當局注意及之。</p>

<h3>節減招生廣告費　移充助學金建議</h3>
<p>— 李善倫</p>
<p>又是學期結束的時期了，學生們忙的應付學期考試，校方除料理一學期的結束事宜，又需準備招收下學期的新生，在此時開始，新聞紙中常佔五十條以上之招生廣告，每日不斷的刋登，若干學校往往從結束日起直刋登到開學後正式上課止，爲時超出三星期，這裏就要以算出一筆巨額的資金。中以最近廣告刋例計長行每行一千二百元，每日三行，刋登二種報紙，就需七千二百元，若刋登二十日就需十四萬四千元，在學校總收入中豈不是一種巨額的支出，如以同樣物價比例於暑假中以五十日計，就得相當於現在三十六萬元，如此巨額之支出，學校方面只得提高學生的學費來補救，另一方面則緊縮敎職員的薪金及其他正當開支，使收支平衡。</p>
<p>如此巨額資金，即以目前寒假的廣告費計算，我們將牠用來作貸學金，每校可平添十位全免生，或二十位半費生，而校方與學生二有裨益，上海據統計有三百多所著名學校，即以廣告支出費之總額合成五十所計算，就有免費生五百名，或半費生一千名。如以每校個別的資金加到敎員薪水上，每校平均假定是十四位，每位敎員就能增二千五百元的月薪，如以暑假與寒假中之廣告費對平，猶不止上面的統計。</p>
<p>綜觀上列實情，可知目前上海多數學校資金運用的失當，况且巨額廣告費之支出，也是學費增加之一大因素，學費的激增正同失學者成正比，學費雖增，學生因之減少，學校經濟未必充裕，失學者的眾多卻是不可战的事實。而且每個校中多有幾個貸金生，他們的掌機是社會上熱心助學者捐助的，校中可將大家捐款的涓滴白費在無謂的項目上嗎？當然是不該有的了。</p>
<p>推學校刋登招生廣告的，無非爲學校自身前途的關係，若不是如此，學生勢必有減無增，數學期後，恐不能維持，故有刋登招生廣告之舉。但因少數學校近營利性質，每於學期終了繼續不斷大事刋登招生廣告，風氣一開，於是互相效尤，不敢落後，造成競爭局面。眼看巨額廣告費支出，一定也非所願。如上海學校聯合起來，於招生廣告作有計劃之刋登，必能化干戈而成玉帛，變浪費爲實際。以筆者的意見，學校方面應該聯合起來，制定於一星期中任何一日同，學校得集團刋登招生廣告於甲報或乙報，如此得讀者發現機會均等之益，地位不必如前冠冕堂皇，只須在分類廣告中另立一招生欄，內容樣求簡潔，僅登班交，分科，考期，校址，已足，性質相同的學校，更可合登一方。如上計劃如能實行，廣告費方面就可減低到二十倍有强。所節省的資金，或增敎員薪給，或直接減低學費，都是好事。學校是毫無損失，在報館方面，雖少了一筆收入，但我想賢明的報館當局，也義不容辭，決不以此筆收入掛懷。時常在學費標準呈請核示聲中，寫此以供參考，並希採納策勵，使其實現，則學子幸甚。</p>

<h3>兒童保育會　兩院實行合併</h3>
<p>上海兒童保育會函稱爲：「敬啟者，敝俞於軍興以後，鑒於兒童受戰事影響，流離失所者觸目皆是，爰設立兒童保育院於白利南路，收容大批流浪兒童，平日除敎養工作以外，策授各種生產技能。辦理以來，尙荷各界贊許。迨二十九年，爲應付實際需要，復增設第二院於南市麗園路五一九號，（即前惠樂園），迄今已達五載。惟敝會素無基金，經費來源，悉仰賴於社會熱心人士，不斷接濟，數年以還，受惠無窮，此敝會同人所深致感謝者也。</p>
<p>乃年來生活高漲，物價飛騰，院中兒童人數隨之激增，每日給養浩繁，時有斷炊之虞，雖經同人竭力羅掘，仍不免有「難乎爲繼」之勢。故　減少日常開支及便利起見，已於聖誕節前，施行合併。原有第一院兒童，全部遷入南市第二院院址，今後仍望社會慈善人士，續加援手，源源濟助，以拯此一般無父無母之羔羊。如蒙各界惠助欵項物品，請紅軍賜送南昌市麗園路該院，并祈隨時蒞院參觀，指正一切，是所至盼。」</p>

<h3>Two Enemy Warships Sunk West of Bana Island; Twenty-Six Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Over Sumatra</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) — Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 5th: (1) An enemy transport convoy entered San Jose Bay on Mindoro Island on the morning of January 4th. An enemy mobile task force entered the sea west of Bana Island that afternoon. Three aircraft from the "Ishin" special attack unit, under fighter cover, penetrated the enemy mobile task force on the evening of January 4th, sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and one battleship or cruiser. One Japanese fighter escort plane self-destructed, and two planes did not return. (2) Japanese air units are continuing to bomb enemy airfields in San Jose and Leyte Island. The results of the fighting from the night of January 2nd to dawn on the 4th are as follows: Seventeen fires started and two explosions occurred in San Jose. Eleven fires started and two major explosions occurred on Leyte Island. Eight Japanese planes did not return. (3) On the morning of January 4th, an enemy mobile task force appeared northwest of Sumatra Island, and eighty carrier-based aircraft attacked northern Sumatra Island. By the evening of that day, the confirmed results of the battle were twenty-six enemy aircraft shot down. Japanese losses were minimal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Continues Attacks; Bombs Enemy Airfields and Ships; U.S. Secretary of War Admits Supplies Are Threatened</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 5th (Central News Agency) — At the beginning of the new year, Japanese air force units continuously attacked enemy airfields and ships in Tacloban. On the 1st, they sank one enemy medium-sized transport ship and damaged two others in the Sulu Sea. During this attack, they also witnessed an enemy large transport ship that had been burning the previous night explode and sink. This attack caused one fire at an enemy airfield in San Jose and two fires at the Tacloban airfield, one of which exploded. The explosions instantly turned the area into a sea of fire. Japanese army air units, on their way back, sank one enemy small transport ship in the Sulu Sea and bombed the Tacloban airfield on the same day, causing two major fires. Despite this heavy blow, the enemy attempted to reinforce their fighting capacity in San Jose. On the 3rd, they dispatched five 100-ton large transport ships and over sixty small boats to the Sulu Sea. However, two aircraft from the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps struck, hitting and setting fire to one large ship, while another caught fire and tilted but did not sink. In addition, they sank one enemy 1,000-ton landing craft.</p>
<p>Forward Base in the Philippines, 5th (Central News Agency) — The elite Japanese air force launched a major attack on Mindoro Island on the night of the 3rd. One unit bypassed enemy patrol aircraft, braved intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, and quickly attacked the runway and affiliated facilities at the northern airfield of San Jose, causing two fires and destroying two enemy aircraft on the ground. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. Other Japanese aircraft also bombed the airfield.</p>
<p>Forward Base in the Philippines, 5th (Central News Agency) — A Japanese bomber squadron attacked the enemy airfield in Tacloban at dawn on the 2nd, repeatedly carrying out dive-bombing attacks. As a result, seven locations were set on fire and two major explosions occurred, causing heavy damage to the airfield facilities and barracks area. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson stated at a meeting with reporters on the 4th, regarding the war situation in the Philippines: The Japanese army's attacking power on the Philippines defense line is still very strong. The U.S. military's supply line on Mindoro Island is constantly threatened by Japanese air force bombings. Although the United States has suffered damage in this supply battle, it is continuing to reinforce the front line with supplies.</p>

We will spare no effort to participate in the war to achieve political independence and economic liberation. If we fail to seize this excellent opportunity to restore our inherent freedom, we will inevitably suffer political and economic oppression in the future and fall into the shackles of the United States, which is inheriting British imperialism. This large-scale war is destroying the foundations of the modern world. To overthrow the old order, a long and arduous struggle must take place. We, the Indian people, fully understand the importance of our responsibilities and national crisis, and we also experience the strength and cunning of British imperialism. However, we cannot deny that British imperialism is not easily overthrown with the support of the United States and other Allied nations. We understand the internal corruption of British imperialism, believe in the power of India today and the combat strength of our allies, and believe in ultimate victory. On February 4, 1944, the war that the Indian National Army (i.e., the Indian Liberation Army) had been waiting for is now being fought against Britain and other Allied countries in the Arakan region of Burma. The Indian Independence War is gradually expanding in the border areas of India and Burma and in various places within Indian territory. Today, free Indians can celebrate the New Year with the vow to expel all the British from Indian soil.</p>
<p>Sukarno's Determination</p>
<p>Jakarta, 4th (Central News Agency) — Sukarno, Chairman of the Central Advisory Council of Java, broadcast to various parts of Greater East Asia from the Jakarta Radio Station at 7:30 PM on the 4th, representing the 70 million Indonesian people, expressing their determination to work closely with the East Asian nations to defeat Britain and the United States. The main points are as follows: The 70 million Indonesian people, located on the southernmost front line, vow to live and die together with the Greater East Asian nations to defeat Britain and the United States. The Indonesian people fully understand the significance of this holy war. Japan's righteous pursuit of justice and fairness is the standard of the Five Principles of the Indonesian Spirit during wartime. This program is not only the spirit guiding the Indonesian people in the war but also an unshakable program after the war. Ultimate victory will belong to us. If the nations of China, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, India, and Indonesia can unite closely, they will jointly crush Britain and the United States throughout the world. Indonesian youth have now risen to defend their homeland. Hundreds of thousands of young people are either joining suicide squads or joining defense conscript armies, waiting to kill the enemy. But the 70 million Indonesian people are also advancing day and night, strengthening the rear's fighting capacity. Indonesia is determined to follow Japan and the nations of Greater East Asia and resolutely rise up to strive for final victory.</p>
<p>Broadcast Speech by the Deputy Prime Minister of Burma</p>
<p>Rangoon, 4th (Central News Agency) — Burmese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Thakin Mya, exchanged broadcasts with the leaders of the Co-Prosperity Sphere at 7:20 PM on the 4th, expressing the nation's determination, generally stating: The so-called offensive by Britain and the United States is now unfolding in the Pacific and Burma. This year will be a year of fierce struggle. We are facing a decisive stage in the historical struggle. We will further strengthen our determination to fight. In the past, we have achieved many military and political results. The Burmese people, like the Japanese and other peoples, possess military strength. In particular, the unique fighting spirit of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps is superior to everything else in war. At this beginning of the fourth year, we will work together to deliver the final blow to the enemy that cannot be remedied. This is the determination of the Burmese people in the new year, and it is also the determination of all East Asian nations.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Touchstone for Clarifying Officialdom</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday, five organizations, including the Shanghai Special City Advisory Committee, held a tea party to welcome Acting Chairman Chen. I participated in the event and delivered a speech, which is reproduced below:</p>
<p>Today, various organizations in Shanghai are welcoming Acting Chairman Chen, firstly to express gratitude for Acting Chairman Chen's past achievements in Shanghai, and secondly to express our hopes for Acting Chairman Chen's future aspirations. Mr. Li Zanhuh has already explained this very clearly. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words from the standpoint of a citizen.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the general situation in the entire peace zone is not entirely satisfactory. On the other hand, the demands of the current situation are extremely urgent and pressing. Therefore, the current situation cannot meet the demands of the times. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon.</p>
<p>Why has such a dangerous phenomenon formed within the peace zone? In summary, it is due to the lack of political power. Of course, this has been forming gradually for a long time. We believe that the leadership has been closely monitoring these phenomena and is determined to rectify them. This can be seen in the repeated instructions issued by Acting Chairman Chen since he took charge of the central government. For example, in the key points that Acting Chairman Chen presented in his inaugural address last year and his New Year's address this year: The third point said "Resolved to clarify officialdom." The fifth point said "In government, we should value integrity, implement construction, and not only need to be steadfast, but also need to move forward." These are all suggestions for political reform.</p>
<p>We have always advocated reforming politics, which in practice means clarifying officialdom. We believe that there are two major enemies in politics today: one is corruption in officialdom, and the other is profiteering in society. If these two major enemies are not thoroughly eradicated, then politics will never be clear and prices will never be stable. Clarifying officialdom is naturally a major undertaking. However, we can now use the ability to accomplish the smallest two things as a touchstone for whether we can clarify officialdom in the future. The first is to strictly prohibit extortion by military police in various places. Think about what extortion is. What is it if it is carried out by people wearing national uniforms? In the past, *lijin* (internal transit taxes) were considered the most troublesome and harsh taxes on the people, but they were abolished with determination. The harassment of extortion now is ten to a hundred times greater than *lijin*. If the government can have the determination to concentrate its forces to eliminate extortion first, it would not be difficult. Let's assume a three-month period for eliminating this. The second is to ban the arrogance of the "black hats" at the train stations. The "black hats" are just small servants at the stations. Is it possible that the power of politics is less than the power of the "black hats"? Although these are employees of the North China Railway and should be the responsibility of the North China Railway, if the North China Railway does not have the ability to ban them, then our government cannot sit idly by and should intervene and ban them. Government officials traveling on the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Ping lines, who has not witnessed this firsthand and felt disgust? Let's assume a one-month period for banning this. If these two small things cannot be done in one month, cannot be done in three months, then all other work to clarify officialdom and reform politics will become empty talk.</p>
<p>Secondly, Acting Chairman Chen also said that today production has gradually stagnated. It is undeniable that in the future, we must attach equal importance to both military and civilian needs, in order to encourage people to devote themselves to the continuation of production. We admire the accuracy of this observation and judgment. Our country's participation in the war can only lean toward economic cooperation, so we must emphasize production. The three provinces and two cities in the peace zone are the wealthiest regions, and it is truly unjustifiable that they have now reached a state of production stagnation. If this is due to the inconvenience of transportation, or the obstacles of certain unreasonable measures in the planned economy, then we should study the interests with the relevant authorities of the Allied nations and use all our strength to overcome this difficulty. The biggest problem at present is the reduction in agricultural production. Therefore, the most important thing to increase agricultural production is to alleviate the suffering of farmers and provide them with the daily necessities they need. To secure the source of these goods, we must emphasize light industrial production. The coordination of agricultural and industrial production is a cycle. We hope that the government will promptly promulgate implementation measures to encourage farmers to increase production, and that there will be an overall plan for all industrial production, with half of the industry turning to military needs to fulfill the task of economic cooperation in the war, and the other half used for civilian needs, and that most of the produced materials will be circulated to rural areas to exchange for agricultural products. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of encouraging people to devote themselves to the continuation of production.</p>
<p>What we need in a political leader is someone who is just, broad-minded, and profound. We believe that Acting Chairman Chen has all of these qualities, and we cannot help but express our fervent hopes.</p>
<h3>Raids on Taiwan and Ryukyu; Enemy American Fighting Spirit Declining; Salt Field Captain Talks About the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>The joint press conference held by the Allied Japanese authorities, land, sea, and air in Shanghai was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel on Nanjing Road. Navy Press Department member Captain Shiota was present. He instructed Lin Junfu, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, etc. Captain Shiota, representing Minister Matsushima, gave a speech on the spot, explaining the anxiety and distress of the enemy Americans in the Pacific Philippines, especially the recent decline in fighting spirit in the raids on Taiwan and Ryukyu. In addition, he explained that the resources of the Americans are quite exhausted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Weak Fighting Spirit in Raids on Taiwan</p>
<p>The U.S. military, judging that the Philippines operation has made no progress, as a result of anxiety, launched raids on Taiwan and Ryukyu on the 4th using carrier-based aircraft and land-based aircraft. Compared with the raids in October last year, the number has decreased significantly, and the attack methods are also very inferior, as if they were practice battles. Therefore, our important facilities have not been damaged in the slightest. The most significant phenomenon of this raid is the weak fighting spirit of the enemy. Therefore, we imagine that most of the aircraft participating in this operation were flying squads that had not been trained enough. The above refers to carrier-based aircraft. As for land-based aircraft, they fled in a panic without dropping bombs. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's move is nothing more than a scare tactic.</p>
<p>Future War Situation is Important</p>
<p>Of course, the enemy's operational goal is to attack Taiwan in the hopes of cutting off the Philippines supply lines. At the same time, it wishes to discover the movements of the U.S. Navy and transport convoys in the Palau Islands. This operation is a preparatory work for the next operation. As for whether the enemy will go to Luzon Island or other locations in the next operation, it can only be determined by how the situation changes. The enemy hopes to open up the current war situation at this time, so the future war situation is very important. Secondly, regarding the British side, it is still difficult to determine how the British Pacific Fleet will cooperate in this operation. However, from all aspects, the Philippines front has intensified from the beginning of the new year. The Japanese side is making preparations for operations, and there will continue to be great victories in the future battles on the Philippines, which you can look forward to.</p>
<p>The Hearts of the People in the Philippines Are Extremely Stable</p>
<p>After Captain Shiota finished speaking on behalf of Minister Matsushima, he spoke about the situation on the Philippines front, saying that according to people who recently came from the Philippines, although the Philippines is constantly bombed by the enemy, the hearts of the people are still extremely stable. Of course, materials are not as abundant as before, and prices are also quite high, but the people's hearts are not shaken. Especially after the enemy landed on Leyte Island, not only were the general public not shaken, they enthusiastically assisted the Japanese army in combat. MacArthur's headquarters issued a warning to the general public stating: If there are Filipinos who help the Japanese army, they will all be killed. Originally, the enemy's first plan for this operation in the Philippines was to expect Filipinos to help them, but the result was the opposite. Therefore, the enemy issued this order in anger. The Japanese in the Philippines have a strong fighting spirit and are completely in line with the Japanese army. Local production in the Philippines has reached a considerable level, and weapons can also be repaired locally.</p>
<p>Enemy British Fleet Incapable of Combat</p>
<p>In addition, regarding what enemy General Fraser said: The British Pacific Fleet, although obeying the orders of the British government, must take its command from the enemy Americans in the Pacific, and in terms of strength, it must also be balanced and not exceed the U.S. fleet. Yesterday, the enemy released news stating: The British Pacific Fleet is linked to the Seventh Fleet, indicating that the British Pacific Fleet is responsible for protecting the supply lines to Australia. Therefore, it is judged that the British fleet would never dare to fight the Japanese fleet and does not have a large military force. Today, the army's new aircraft will appear, surpassing enemy American aircraft in speed and quickly. The production of enemy American bombers, the B2429 type, and the p51 type fighter jets has sharply decreased, decreasing by an average of more than 1,000 aircraft per month. The reason is actually due to the insufficient labor force. In order to solve the problem of human resources and protect military strength, the enemy American does not hesitate to reduce the rear's productive workforce and replace it with machines to increase production. According to the former U.S. Production Bureau's Mobilization Bureau, it still boasted to the general public about the vast size of its productivity, but the most difficult thing is the lack of human resources. It deeply hopes that the people will cooperate, otherwise it will be difficult to win the war against Japan. Since the start of the war, the U.S. has rarely made such remarks. Now, because it has driven all human resources to the front line, it is using sweet words and deception. Furthermore, according to yesterday's German news agency, the United States has drafted farmers aged eighteen to twenty-eight into military service, and is deeply anxious about the suffering of its own human resources. Japan, on the other hand, has only dispatched half of its army and navy overseas, which shows the might of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves Tax Increase Outline</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese government has carefully reviewed the tax policy for the next year, first reviewing the general accounting budget of 22.244 billion yen for the next year and the recently decided additional budget for temporary military expenditures, and at the same time, in order to strengthen wartime finances and absorb general floating buying power, it has decided to implement a tax increase policy of 1.8 billion yen annually. This was approved in the cabinet meeting on the 4th. As for the contents of the tax increase outline, it has been decided to announce it on the 5th. After the draft of the tax increase outline has been sorted out, it will be endorsed in the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, and will be formally approved as a legal outline. The targets of this tax increase are the classified income tax law, the special tax law, and income taxes, which are direct taxes, and liquor tax and transit taxes, which are indirect taxes.</p>
<h3>Outline for the Allocation of Increased Production Subsidies to Cooperatives This Year</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — In order to quickly allocate agricultural increased production subsidies this year, fully exert the function of cooperatives, and promote increased production work, the Agricultural Increased Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan has formulated the "Outline for the Allocation of Agricultural Increased Production Subsidies to Cooperatives in the 34th Year of the Republic" and the details have been passed by the committee and promulgated for implementation. The contents of the outline include:</p>
<p>(1) The agricultural increased production subsidies will be managed by the Agricultural Increased Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The methods for allocating the subsidies are as follows: (A) Each county and district cooperative branch applying for subsidies should fill out an application form and business plan in six copies and send them to the relevant authorities. (B) Each relevant authority will send one representative to jointly review the matters. The application form and business plan can only be forwarded for collection after approval. (C) When reviewing the application form mentioned above, in addition to sending personnel to conduct on-site investigations as a reference for approval, each authority may also form a supervisory team and send it to the area to supervise the increased production work.</p>
<p>(3) The subsidies for cooperative technicians and township agricultural promotion associations under the increased production subsidy items shall be issued for two months in advance in principle.</p>
<p>(4) The subsidies for the training of agricultural instructors for key farmer cooperatives under the increased production subsidy items should be allocated with reference to the investigation reports of the supervisory team.</p>
<p>(5) Other increased production subsidies may be allocated in advance for the necessary parts in accordance with the business plan and the investigation reports of the supervisory team.</p>
<p>(6) The committee and relevant authorities may contact and send personnel to review the use of the subsidies by the cooperative at any time.</p>
<h3>New People's Society Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>Beiping, 5th (Central News Agency) — In order to handle the proposals of the joint conference of the entire body in the 33rd year of the Republic of China and to discuss the implementation plan in order to fulfill the mission of increased production and transportation borne by North China as a rear base, the Central Headquarters of the New People's Society held a meeting at the society this afternoon (5th) to discuss the handling plan for the proposals. More than 30 representatives from the General Office, including Councilor Luo Baochun, were invited to attend the meeting. After the meeting began, Councilor Luo Baochun, the chairman of the committee, delivered an opening speech, and the attendees exchanged opinions on the 14th proposal for social construction, which proposed strengthening mass organizations, implementing strict training, establishing an anti-communist system, and stabilizing people's lives, and the 15th proposal, which proposed that the government provide universal relief to disaster victims to maintain social order and benefit construction. The various implementation plans were discussed in detail, and the temporary motions 14 and 15 were also discussed. The meeting lasted for about three hours before adjourning.</p>

<h3>Director of Intelligence Department, Kishi, Returns to Nanjing; Expresses Impressions of Hankou; Hankou's Air Defense Facilities Are Extremely Complete</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — Director of the Intelligence Department of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Kishi Ichi, recently went to Hankou on official business and returned to Nanjing on New Year's Day. Yesterday, he met with a group of reporters at his official residence and expressed his impressions of the air defense situation of Japanese residents in Hankou under bombing: The Japanese residents in Hankou, under blind bombing, under the guidance of Consul General Nakano and other officials, are actively engaged in reconstruction work, and their spirit is admirable. The local Japanese army and navy authorities have repeatedly provided them with convenience and assistance, which is especially appreciated. In the air raid on December 18, there were very few casualties among the Japanese residents. The main reason is that the air defense facilities are complete and the usual training is sufficient. Even after the blind bombing, they were able to respond calmly, as if they were practicing. We deeply feel that organized air defense is the most important work in air defense, and we especially hope that the equipment of air-raid shelters in various places can be improved in the future.</p>
<h3>The Headquarters of the First Area Army Moves to Suzhou; Each Army and Division Still Stationed in Original Defenses</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — Commander-in-Chief of the First Area Army, Mr. Ren Yuandao, since concurrently serving as Governor of Jiangsu Province and Pacification Director stationed in Suzhou, has worked hard to unify the military and administration of the entire province. Currently, because the headquarters of the First Area Army was originally located in Nanjing, and now in order to facilitate command and office work, he has specially moved the headquarters of the First Area Army to Suzhou. As for the remaining armies and divisions, they will still be stationed in their original defenses and will not be changed. In order to facilitate liaison with the central authorities, the First Area Army Headquarters Liaison Office will be established at the original site of the headquarters in Nanjing. It is heard that the candidate for the director of the Liaison Office of the headquarters will be formally announced in the near future.</p>
<h3>Sun Liangcheng's Troops Transfer to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) General Sun Liangcheng, concurrently the Pacification Director of Northern Jiangsu and Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route Army, has been ordered to transfer his troops. He personally led his elite soldiers from Henan to Taizhou, suppressing bandit troops and pacifying the people along the way. With a firm belief in "Revitalizing Asia and Protecting China," he completed the troop transfer mission. According to someone from Northern Jiangsu yesterday, after General Sun arrived in Jiangsu, he met with Chen Caifu, commander of the 26th Division stationed in Jiangsu, and Sun Yutian, commander of the 38th Division, in Yancheng. They were warmly welcomed by the local people. When General Sun's troops marched into Northern Jiangsu along the Longhai Railway line, they engaged in a fierce battle near Funing, Xiangshui, and Jiang with the main force of the communist Old Eighth Route Army. Because the officers and soldiers fought bravely, they finally defeated the bandit troops completely, inflicting countless casualties. The strength of the communist bandits in Northern Jiangsu has been greatly weakened by this blow. The coerced militiamen have successively repented and returned. The officers and soldiers used the militiamen as guides to thoroughly eliminate the bandit strongholds and implement a policy of both suppression and appeasement. To plan the establishment of strongholds, he specially accompanied General Chen Caifu, who has been stationed in Jiangsu for eight years, to inspect Wu Gu Zhao Zhuang, Dongtai, Haizhou, Taizhou and other places, while also investigating popular sentiment. He was warmly welcomed by the local people and attended public rallies to express sympathy to the people in various places, encouraging them to follow national policies wholeheartedly, so as to achieve the goal of military-civilian unity in completing the war effort and realizing the late Chairman Wang's legacy.</p>
<h3>Soviet Artillery Bombardment, Fierce Attack on Buda-Pest, German Troops Still Defend Underground Fortress</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) Soviet troops occupied the high ground around Budapest and began bombarding German strongholds with rocket artillery starting on the first. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, German positions were located in the basements of tall buildings and connected by deep trenches, making them veritable underground fortresses. The intense Soviet bombardment appeared to be ineffective. Soviet forces continued to increase their explosive power and on the third had occupied most of the Buda district west of the city, up to the Danube's west bank, Mido Ros Home Di, and Ma Xing Jia Li Tai Bridge. German air forces in the skies above the city constantly attacked Soviet supply lines and, starting on the second, began to supply German strongholds besieged by Soviet forces from the air.</p>
<p>German Troops Maintain Initiative</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th) Highton News Agency: Since Marshal Rundstedt seized the initiative on December 16th of last year, he has maintained this advantage. The situation on the Western Front can be described in the following five points: (1) The German offensive between the Moselle and Meuse rivers has scattered the US First Army. (2) Eisenhower had to urgently transfer General Patton's Second Army from the Saar front to the gap in Belgium to protect the northern flank of the anti-Axis forces from threats. Therefore, the threat to the German forces on the Saar front has now been lifted. (3) The US Seventh Army also had to take over the front line formerly defended by the US Third Army. The American and Seventh Armies south of Balaton were forced to withdraw from the land they had captured at great cost outside the Maginot Line and the German West Wall. (4) The German West Wall defenses are far stronger than the enemy imagined, so German troops were able to launch a counter-offensive and halt their advance. (5) German morale is high, and they have achieved a balance in military equipment production, so the war situation is favorable to the German forces.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces in Italy for the Po River Plain</h3>
<p>Dispatching Forces of Twenty Divisions</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th) In order to compete for the strategically important Po River Plain, the anti-Axis forces have dispatched as many as twenty divisions. The commander-in-chief of the anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean region is attempting to gradually break through the Apennine valleys and directly approach the southwestern corner of the Po Plain. Although the enemy has deployed large numbers of tanks and ordnance in this area, they have not been able to complete the encirclement. German generals are responding effectively, and enemy advances have repeatedly failed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union May Recognize Polish Provisional Government</h3>
<p>Anglo-American Attitude Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) Highton News Agency, Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met yesterday with the leader of the "Hungarian Provisional Government" delegation, Li Ang Ge Qi.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) German News Agency: According to the Swedish Daily Newspaper, although London had hoped that the Soviet Union would not recognize the Lublin Polish government before the anti-Axis three-nation conference discusses the Polish issue, if the Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and Latvian Soviet Republics have already recognized the Lublin government, then the Soviet Union's recognition of that government is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) German News Agency, London: The Polish Peasant Party, led by former Prime Minister Mikolajczyk, issued a statement saying that if Britain, the United States, and France recognize the Lublin Committee, it would be tantamount to approving the establishment of a communist Poland. A communist Poland will soon be incorporated into the Soviet Union, and with the consent of Britain, the United States, and France, its independence, freedom, and strength will be destroyed.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Congress Postponed</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Stockholm, 5th) Highton News Agency citing London: The British Conservative Party Congress, originally scheduled to be held from January 29th to 31st, has now been postponed to March 14th to 15th. This news has caused a stir in political circles. It is said that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin will hold a meeting at the end of this month, and if the congress is not postponed, Churchill and Eden will be unable to attend.</p>
<h3>German Navy's Battle Achievements Last Month</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th) The German Führer's headquarters announced on the 4th: In combat during December, the German Navy sank six hundred tons, sixteen destroyer escorts.</p>

<h3>The Decisive Battle Politics of the Capital and the New Year</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Dan Ming</p>
<p>The 34th year of the Republic of China is the year of the final decisive battle between the Axis and anti-Axis camps. Therefore, on New Year's Day entering this year, we can see that the Chinese people, both government and public, are showing a kind of resolute new spirit. Especially in our country's capital, although brilliant national flags are fluttering in the clear sky, the people of the whole city are enduring a difficult life and expressing deep expectations for the government's decisive battle politics.</p>
<p>Simple Government Celebrations</p>
<p>As usual, on New Year's Day, the National Government holds a celebration in the National Government Auditorium, gathering high-ranking civil and military officials from across the country. Although they did not stop New Year's greetings like the Allied agencies in China, the celebration held that day was also very simple. Acting Chairman Chen simply read aloud the prepared New Year's instructions. Chen's face was visibly slightly older, and in his steady steps, one could see that he was making courageous plans for the future fate of our country. Since Chairman Wang's death, he has consistently adhered to the firm belief that the country must be unified and the party indivisible, inheriting the consistently policy of the past, which is truly worthy of our admiration. Because it is the year of the decisive battle, the New Year's celebration was completed in a simple and solemn atmosphere, lasting only about twenty or thirty minutes. There were particularly few news reporters present that day. Especially unexpectedly, reporters from our country's newspapers and news agencies did not go, and Japanese reporters were not seen either. Exceptions included a reporter and a special correspondent from the New Shen Bao stationed in Beijing, as well as two reporters from a German news agency. At the same time, during the New Year's celebration every year, in addition to news reporters, there are often cinematographers from film companies and press photographers, but their presence was also not seen this time.</p>
<p>The Memorable Ningyuan Building</p>
<p>Since I had arrived at the National Government, I talked with several acquaintances officials. I learned that the Executive Yuan is located behind the National Government Auditorium. After Acting Chairman Chen concurrently served as the head of the Yuan, he has now set up an office for the head of the Yuan. Because Chairman Wang used to work in his residence, there was no such office before. However, before this office was set up! Acting Chairman Chen used to meet with important figures at Ningyuan Building, and the Executive Yuan meetings and Supreme National Defense Council meetings were also moved here from Chairman Wang's residence. Originally, Ningyuan Building was behind the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and used to be where the National Government received foreign guests. What is especially memorable is that the signing of all treaties with the Allied powers after the National Government's return to the capital was held there. The reporter lingered there for a long time, thinking of the late Chairman Wang's magnificent achievements during his lifetime, truly feeling the peach blossom human face! To the right of the National Government Auditorium was originally the Legislative Yuan, but due to personnel changes, it has now been changed to the Control Yuan!</p>
<p>Quiet in Personnel Changes</p>
<p>Staying in the capital during the New Year, I felt particularly lonely this time. Most of the important officials of the National Government have gone to Shanghai, although the agencies only had one day of holiday. It is said that Acting Chairman Chen will also go to Shanghai for the handover of the municipal government, and with the personnel changes in the Shanghai municipal government, most of those who are pursuing their careers in the officialdom have also set their sights on Shanghai. Speaking of the capital, in the partial personnel changes in the Executive Yuan this time, the Minister of Propaganda was replaced. However, because Minister Lin was transferred to the Governor of Anhui Province, it is said that the original staff will also follow him. Therefore, before the new minister has arrived, the atmosphere in the capital is becoming more and more quiet! I don't know whether these personnel changes can lead our country's politics to a more clear stage. When Acting Chairman Chen went to take over the Shanghai municipal government before, it is said that all the government cars were driven away. Perhaps there has been progress after two or three years! As a reporter, I am, of course, more concerned about the future of the propaganda industry. If the establishment of the China News Association today leads to a new unity of reporters, then the new propaganda authorities should fulfill their new propaganda mission at this crucial juncture of the decisive battle.</p>
<p>New Construction of Rural Autonomy</p>
<p>I unintentionally ran into a former student of mine on the street. He is now the district chief of a certain district in Lishui. I heard many things about the "New Fourth Blaze" from him. The "New Fourth Army" is called the bandit army, but in reality, it is all affected by the official oppression of the people's rebellion. Now, it is said that there is peace in the places where these "bandit armies" are located. However, they unanimously rise up to arrest those who abuse their power for personal gain. From this point of view, the corrupt officials under the National Government's rule are actually only being restrained by the "bandit army" today, which is truly heartbreaking. It is said that Acting Chairman Chen has mustered up his determination to purify the officialdom since the Allied powers returned to the capital. His approach is to start by reorganizing rural township administration and autonomous groups. The National Government will have new plans for the Baojia system in townships and will promulgate unified regulations. Rural construction will begin with the three methods of self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency. If our country can quickly establish such a strongman team with three missions, the reporter firmly believes that bandit troubles may be reduced a lot. In addition, we now have only one thing that needs to be worked hard, that is, currency must be linked to production, otherwise, the result of continuing to increase the issuance of currency is quite dangerous in the future. Because the treatment of National Government civil servants will soon be improved, but this kind of palliative method is not a fundamental solution. The only method of relief is to adopt a production standard. Although the New Year is quiet in the capital, the light of its new efforts is gradually emerging. We hope that Acting Chairman Chen and his comrades will boldly do it! (Sent from Nanjing on January 2nd) Stacks of Japanese Shell Production</p>

At exactly 4:00 PM, Acting Chairman Chen gracefully arrived, performed the ritual, and first the chairman of the conference, Li Si Hao, delivered a welcoming speech. Then, the presidium presented a commemorative cup, followed by Acting Chairman Chen delivering instructions. His words were earnest and inspiring, with many encouragements, which deeply moved the listeners, and applause broke out like thunder.

<p>Li Sihao</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen, distinguished officials, distinguished guests, today, the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Welfare Association, the Charity Group, the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and other organizations, are holding a tea party to welcome Acting Chairman Chen on the occasion of his visit to Shanghai. We are very honored by your presence. Acting Chairman Chen served as the Mayor of Shanghai for four years, during which he made arduous efforts for the restoration and construction of Shanghai. In particular, the negotiations and reception of the concessions, the completion of the unification of the municipality, were the most glorious page in his political achievements. Standing in the position of the citizens of Shanghai, we express our sincere gratitude. Now that Acting Chairman Chen has left the position of Mayor of Shanghai, we have a sense of regret, but in the future, he will assume greater responsibilities in the central government, and he will certainly be more active in guiding the construction of this city. We hope that Acting Chairman Chen will continue to uphold his loyal and patriotic aspirations, start anew with the people, innovate politics, and take increasing production, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and establishing public security as the starting point to gradually put politics on the right track. We wish Acting Chairman Chen good health, a prosperous career, and good fortune to the country.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman</p>
<p>Instructional Address</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen then delivered his instructional address. His words were earnest. First, he expressed his gratitude for the warm reception of the various organizations. He then said: "In the past few years, there has not been much success in the work I have done. I have made no contribution to the country, and I have not been able to help Mr. Wang." In the middle, when he mentioned Mr. Wang's spirit of "forgetting oneself for the country" and "having the country but no self" in the past ten years, Mr. Chen's eyes were filled with tears, which deeply moved the listeners. Finally, he said: "I have been in Shanghai for more than four years, and I have been determined from the beginning to only seek merit and not be afraid of mistakes. However, I have not seen any merits in the past four years, but I have made many mistakes, and I am deeply ashamed. Although everyone can forgive me, I cannot forgive myself. In the future, the situation will become increasingly serious, and I dare not say that I am confident in completing everyone's expectations. I only hope to follow Mr. Wang's spirit of "forgetting oneself for the country" and "having the country but no self," and continue the unfinished business. As long as China can achieve peaceful unification, I will not shirk difficulties and will not hesitate to sacrifice. This is something I can responsibly tell everyone, tell all the citizens of Shanghai, and even the 450 million compatriots across the country."</p>

<h3>Entertainment Venues Strictly Prohibited from Operating Overtime</h3>
<p>In order to control electricity consumption and adapt to the wartime system, the municipal authorities have long stipulated and announced the operating hours and electricity usage times of various industries and ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to strictly supervise various industries to comply. However, at present, some entertainment venues disregard the laws and operate overtime, which is illegal. The Administrative Section of the Bureau ordered the Security Administrative Section to send personnel to various districts to conduct strict investigations on a daily basis starting yesterday (the 4th). Entertainment venues operating overtime will have the overtime time recorded in the investigation register at the time, and the venues will be required to stamp it as proof. They will be severely punished in accordance with the law, and customers staying will also be punished in accordance with Article 37 of the Violation of Police Law.</p>
<h3>Household Coal Briquettes Eagerly Awaiting Distribution</h3>
<p>Recently, as the Spring Festival is approaching, the price of firewood and charcoal fuel in this city has soared. Families in the middle and lower classes of citizens are in danger of running out of food. With regard to the distribution of the seventh phase of household coal briquettes, they unanimously hope that the authorities will distribute them early in order to alleviate the serious threat to citizens' fuel supply. After the sixth phase of household coal briquettes was fully distributed, it has been almost two months since then, but there is still no definite distribution date for the seventh phase of coal briquettes, which has turned the black market coal briquettes active, which is contrary to the fundamental purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods and suppressing prices.</p>
<h3>Directors of Various Bureaus Transferred, Expediting Handover</h3>
<p>The 235th meeting of the Executive Yuan of the National Government passed the transfer of the directors of the Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Economic Bureau, the Director of the Goods Allocation Office and the Director of the Special Tax Office for Silk Construction of the Ministry of Finance of Shanghai Special Municipality. After the transfer, the various bureaus and offices have been ordered to expedite the conclusion and prepare for the handover to the successors. The directors of the various bureaus and offices will report to Beijing for instructions and set a date for the respective handovers.</p>
<h3>Yimiao Police Bureau Holds Joint Security Conference</h3>
<p>After the re-adjustment of the Baojia in the entire Nanshi District, the newly appointed Baojia chiefs have been officially commissioned to carry out the Baojia mission. The Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau specially convened a joint security conference for the Bao chiefs of the Yimiao District in the conference room of the sub-bureau yesterday afternoon. The conference was presided over by the sub-bureau chief Meng Xianqi, who instructed the new Bao chiefs on various measures to be taken in preventing and controlling the current situation.</p>
<h3>Banks with Cash Flow Problems Stop Check Clearing, No Impact on Financial Consolidation</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the guidelines and implemented the strengthening of the financial institutions in this city, financial institutions with generally unsound content and organization have been greatly affected and have successively tried to increase their capital amount and absorb deposits to replenish their reserves in order to meet the requirements of the government's strengthening laws. However, there are occasionally several financial institutions that have not only failed to increase their capital, but also found it difficult to absorb deposits, so they suddenly showed poor cash flow and were unable to cope with their operations. After the operating accounts for the past year were completed and the holiday period expired, the clearing of checks of certain three banks has been suspended by the bank association clearing house, except for the Jianghai Bank, which automatically announced its liquidation because it did not intend to continue operating. This suspension of check clearing is due to the fact that the banks themselves have no good skills to use their operating funds, resulting in this bad phenomenon, and has no impact on the entire finance. On the contrary, it can enhance the credibility of legitimate financial institutions, but it is expected that before the strengthening policy has completed its mission, a large number of illegitimate financial institutions will still have the same situation.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Regularly Holds Judicial Liaison Meetings</h3>
<p>The Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to strive for the advancement of the entire judicial business of this city, has decided to hold judicial liaison meetings on the 15th of each month starting this month. In addition to the chiefs of the various departments of the department and the directors of the judicial shares of the various sub-bureaus, the heads of the various judicial organs such as the Shanghai District Court, the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, and the Shanghai Prison, as well as the various figures in the Shanghai judicial community, will be invited to attend. The judicial business and the various tasks of preventing crime will be discussed in detail to jointly plan the advancement.</p>

<h3>China News Association Shanghai Branch Established - Former News Federation Declared Dissolved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has been established and will begin operations from New Year's Day. The office is located at the former address of the News Federation at 160 Great Shanghai Road. The Association will hold a tea party at the Hua Mao Hotel on Nanjing Road at 4:00 PM today to welcome people from all walks of life and announce its establishment. At the same time, the former Shanghai News Federation is declared dissolved. Declarations are published separately as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of Dissolution of the Shanghai News Federation</p>
<p>This Federation was established on January 27, 1943, and has been in existence for almost two years. Two years ago, various Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the city collectively felt that in order to fulfill the mission that the news industry should bear, and to strengthen the solidarity of the news industry, it was necessary to take a unified step to jointly promote progress. Therefore, the Federation was specially organized. On the day of its establishment, the primary goal was to promote Pan-Asianism and the national policies of China and Japan, to study the development of the news industry and to exert its performance, and to fulfill the mission of the news industry as the pioneer of the times. At the same time, this was set as the direction of our work. Over the past two years, thanks to the solid guidance of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the warm care of people from all walks of life, and the efforts and cooperation of colleagues in the industry, especially the harmonious cooperation of colleagues assigned by various newspapers to participate in this Federation, the work of this Federation has been continuously promoted. We are grateful and fortunate for this.</p>
<p>We have tried to review the work done in the past two years and compare it with the initial goal. We cannot help but feel ashamed. Although we have made considerable efforts to promote Pan-Asianism and the national policies of China and Japan, we have not been able to fully meet expectations due to limited capabilities. Regarding the research and development of the news industry, we feel that we have not exerted even one-tenth of our efforts, and we dare not claim to be pioneers of the times. Although limited by the environment where manpower and resources are insufficient, the entire mission of the news industry requires eliminating obstacles and actively promoting progress. Now, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has been established to develop the entire Chinese news industry. The establishment of this Federation was originally to meet the needs of the time and place, and its work is exactly the same as that of the News Association, with the same goals. Therefore, it has been decided to dissolve. Colleagues from various newspapers in this Federation will continue to participate in the Association in order to realize the unfinished business of this Federation. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Declaration of</p>
<p>Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the China News</p>
<p>Association</p>
<p>The China News Association was established on September 25, 1944. The articles of association stipulate the establishment of branches in various important regions. This Association was established in accordance with the articles of association. Two years ago, the news industry in this city had already organized the Shanghai News Federation in order to jointly promote the mission of the news industry, which is the same as the mission of this Association, and the work is consistent. Therefore, the foundation of this Association has already been laid. In the future, under the guidance of the General Association, we will certainly seek to enrich it further.</p>
<p>When the China News Association was established, a declaration had already been announced, and the work and mission were roughly explained. There is no need to repeat them here. However, Shanghai is the center of national culture and education, and especially the most developed region of the national news industry. In the past, each acted independently, failing to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, and failing to form the power of the center of public opinion. After the establishment of the News Federation, it initially had the scale of a unified step. Now that this Association is officially established, on the one hand, it will continue the unfinished business of the News Federation, and on the other hand, it will follow the instructions of the News Association to promote work. Secondly, in this decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, special attention must be paid to the key points of the decisive battle propaganda. First, emphasize the important relationship between the Greater East Asia War and the life and death of various East Asian countries. If we win, we will coexist. If we lose, we will perish together. Therefore, we must awaken the national determination and firm the belief that we will win. Second, we must require the government to pay attention to public opinion, and the basis of public opinion propaganda should be the interests of the public. If it is beneficial to the country and the people's livelihood, we will promote and praise it. If it is harmful to the country and the people's livelihood, we will not hesitate to remonstrate. Regarding political corruption, social speculation and profiteering, hoarding, and the abnormal phenomena of only caring about private interests and not caring about the public, we will regard them as targets of public criticism, expose them collectively, and leave them nowhere to escape. In short, awakening the deaf and exposing the treacherous and incompetent, guiding society on the right track, and expecting political integrity, increasing national strength, and contributing to the Greater East Asia War, is the general direction of the work of this Association. We respectfully ask people from all walks of life to provide guidance and criticism. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>The important officers of the Association have been determined:</p>
<p>Chairman: Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Standing Directors: Osaka Yoichi, Chu Baoheng, Xu Liqiu,</p>
<p>Jin Xiongbo, Huang Jingzhai, Chen Riping, Yuan Shu, Moriyama Takashi</p>

<h3>The Problem of the Municipal Fiscal Center</h3>
<p>— Gu Guodong</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Accounting Office was established in July 1942. For the past two years, its achievements have been remarkable. However, after the merger of the first and eighth districts into the municipal government, many fiscal matters urgently need to be promoted starting this year. Here are some of the key issues concerning the municipal fiscal center:</p>
<p>(1) Compilation of the Municipal General Budget</p>
<p>Since the city took over the concessions and the merger of the first and eighth districts on February 1st of last year, and the incorporation of the first district into the municipal government on August 1st, the municipal administration has become unified. Regarding accounting matters, because the fiscal year had not ended at that time, and because the actual situations of the first and eighth districts in the past were different according to their old practices, it was not possible to merge them by completely eliminating their differences. However, the compilation of the city's general budget for this year should be unified with a single general budget of revenue and expenditure as the principle. The city's budget should not be divided into three parts: "Old First District," "Old Eighth District," and "Old City District," based on past practices. As a result, the city's revenue and expenditure cannot be centrally planned and managed. Consequently, the salaries and benefits of various municipal agencies also vary due to the different revenue and expenditure situations of the three parts, which is not appropriate. The government budget is the basis for implementing policies, so a sound budget is necessary to implement good municipal administration.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment of the Municipal Accounting System</p>
<p>When the Accounting Office was established, the "Shanghai Municipal Government Accounting Regulations" were promulgated, but after several revisions, they have become outdated. They should be redrafted to determine the basis for the implementation of accounting by various municipal agencies. Moreover, after the merger of the first and eighth districts, the three parts of the budget are divided into three sets of accounts. The "Old Eighth District" and "Old City District" are handled in accordance with the municipal accounting regulations. The "Old First District" still uses the accounting system of the former Public Works Department, which leads to divergences in municipal accounting matters. In the future, it is hoped that the design and establishment of the accounting system of various agencies will be clarified and that the "Accounting Regulations" will be redrafted.</p>
<p>(3) Replenishing Municipal Accounting Personnel</p>
<p>From the Accounting Office down to the accounting personnel in charge and assistant accounting personnel in various units and agencies, there are very few specialized talents. The old practice of appointing personnel based on the old practices of officialdom, employing the principles of appointing people from the same hometown or old subordinates, should be abolished. This reduces administrative efficiency and even makes it impossible to clarify accounting matters, to promote accounting smoothly, and to strictly enforce accounting powers. In the future, it is hoped that the Accounting Office and various agencies will employ personnel with accounting knowledge as much as possible as accounting personnel in charge and assistant accounting personnel. If there is a shortage of talent, it may be possible to openly solicit reserves for use. Regulations on the appointment of accounting personnel should be formulated to strengthen personnel management.</p>
<p>(4) Improving the Municipal Accounting Organization</p>
<p>The existing departments within the Accounting Office have not been set up separately according to the different matters. Each department is divided according to the limits of "Old First District," "Old Eighth District," and "Old City District." In order to seek to improve the organization and implement a comprehensive organization that adopts an internal control system, various departments should be set up separately for accounting, budgeting, statistics, auditing, and inspection. In addition, offices for specialists and inspectors should be established. Specialists are responsible for the research of accounting policies and special assignments. Inspectors are responsible for supervising the accounting of various municipal agencies and conducting on-site audits in order to promote and increase the effectiveness of accounting work.</p>
<p>The above points are just a few of the major issues that are related to the municipal fiscal center. All of the city's revenue and expenditure should be calculated and balanced in a unified and centralized manner, making it coordinated and fair. The approval and payment of various expenses should be guided legally and reasonably. All personnel, land, and materials should be statistically detailed and accurate, so that the construction of various projects can be weighed in order of urgency, determining the priorities, gains, and losses, so that public funds are not wasted. Accurate budget preparation, sound accounting system, sufficient accounting personnel, and a sound accounting organization are the urgent tasks of the city's accounting policies at present. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News - University Students Expand Scholarship Campaign - Full-Effort Charity Performance of "Wealthy Floating Clouds"</h3>
<p>University students receiving aid from the Newspaper Reader Scholarship Fund have decided to hold a charity stage play for two days to expand the "Special Fundraising" effort. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used for the scholarship fund. After a long period of preparation, things are finally starting to take shape. The play is "Wealthy Floating Clouds," directed by the famous directors Zuo Lin and Zhang Fa. The play has 20-30 male and female actors and is not limited to scholarship students. More than 300 university students have volunteered. After careful selection by Mr. Zuo Lin, those with acting talent and more stage experience have been selected to participate. They are now actively rehearsing and plan to perform in mid-February. The title of the play, "Wealthy Floating Clouds," can be said to be targeted at reality. Confucius said, "Wealth and honor obtained through injustice are like floating clouds to me." We advise the general "wealthy and honored" officials and businessmen at sea to deeply appreciate this and re-examine their "outlook on life" in order to correct their mistakes. This play is adapted by Mr. Yuan Jun based on a Western, modern, successful philosophical comedy. Readers who have a good memory will remember a famous film called "You Can't Take It With You," which is the same as the play "Wealthy Floating Clouds." At a glance, you can know the excellence of the content of this play and the splendor of the performance. Here, in addition to admiring the enthusiasm of the university students for helping with scholarships, we also hope that people from all walks of life will give sponsorship in order to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Application Forms</p>
<p>Deadline Tonight</p>
<p>This office began issuing the eighth session application forms and student status certificates based on the receipts issued previously. Yesterday, from morning to evening, schools at all levels, from large to small, sent staff to the center to collect them. A few schools have not yet collected them. We hope that they will come to collect them today and fill in the names and numbers according to the above, and forward them to the scholarship students for careful filling. The schools should then fill in the recommendation letter and return it to this office by January 15 at the latest for review. The student status certificates should be properly preserved and sent to this office after approval to be stamped for solemnity. Universities can give the receipts to the representatives of the scholarship student fellowship to collect them. The eighth session application is temporarily limited to old students who received scholarships in the previous session. New students should postpone their applications. Students of all schools should pay attention.</p>
<p>Xinben Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>Joint Fundraising</p>
<p>A letter from Team B of Senior One of Xinben Girls' Middle School says: "Respected Sirs, our classmates recently read the appeal for aid to students from poor families who are dropping out of school, which was published in your newspaper. We were deeply touched. We, as members of the academic community, could not bear to sit idly by. However, we felt that our own efforts were weak and we could not help much. Therefore, we launched a joint fundraising effort. We have received donations from people from all walks of life, totaling 84,640 yuan, which we respectfully present to fulfill our human duty of mutual assistance. We also hope that students from all schools will respond and alleviate the suffering of young people who are dropping out of school. We hope so."</p>
<p>Women's Ping Pong</p>
<p>Finals Tomorrow</p>
<p>Since this newspaper launched the fundraising campaign for the current scholarship fund, we have received enthusiastic responses and generous donations from all quarters. Zhengxing Girls' Middle School is donating tickets to the finals of the Zhengxing Cup Ping Pong Tournament, which is hosted by the school, to those who donate to the scholarship fund. This is an unprecedented example in the education and sports communities. We hope that people from all walks of life will follow suit and work together to expand the scholarship fund. Zhengxing Girls' Middle School on Luoyang Road has a long history and is serious about running the school. After this newspaper announced the special fundraising plan, the school immediately responded and organized a fundraising team. Its spirit of enthusiasm for helping with scholarships is a model for other schools. The school launched the first Zhengxing Cup Shanghai Women's Individual Ping Pong Championship. Dozens of people signed up to participate. After several group elimination matches, six group champions were produced. The situation in each match was extremely enthusiastic. After two more rounds of the rematch, only the final match between Lin Jinlan and Zhou Ruihua remained in the entire order. The school will hold the finals tomorrow (the 7th) at 2:00 PM at the West Xu Fitness Room on Jing'an Temple Road. All the upstairs tickets were given away completely within one day. People from all walks of life went to donate and ask for tickets in an endless stream. The school's staff have been enthusiastically running around for this all day, and we are deeply touched.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Cakes</p>
<p>All proceeds go to charity</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Huang Hanliang of Guanshengyuan says: "Respected Sirs, this time, our company has specially made two cakes for auction during the New Year's holiday to assist in the public welfare undertakings run by your newspaper, the News and the Shanghai South Charity Association. All proceeds from the cakes will be donated. The above cakes have been bid for 70,000 yuan by an anonymous philanthropist, and the battleship-shaped cake has been bid for 50,000 yuan. The total amount received for the pagoda-shaped cake is 120,000 yuan, which will be donated as follows: 30,000 yuan to the Shenbao Scholarship Fund, 10,000 yuan to the Poverty Relief Fund, 10,000 yuan to the Winter Relief Fund, 50,000 yuan to the News Loan Scholarship Fund, and 20,000 yuan to the Shanghai South Charity Association's expenses.

<h3>Proposal to Reduce Enrollment Advertising Costs and Use the Savings for Scholarships</h3>
<p>— Li Shanlun</p>
<p>It's the end of the semester again. Students are busy preparing for the end-of-semester exams, and schools are not only handling the end-of-semester matters but also preparing to enroll new students for the next semester. At this time, newspapers are often filled with more than 50 lines of enrollment advertisements, which are published continuously every day. Some schools often publish advertisements from the end of the semester until formal classes begin after the start of the semester, which lasts for more than three weeks, which means a huge amount of money will be spent. According to the recent advertising rates, each long line costs 1,200 yuan, and three lines a day published in two newspapers would cost 7,200 yuan. If the advertisements are published for 20 days, it would cost 144,000 yuan. Isn't this a huge expenditure in the school's total income? If the same price ratio is calculated for 50 days during the summer vacation, it would be equivalent to 360,000 yuan now. With such a huge expenditure, schools have to raise students' tuition to make up for it, while on the other hand, they have to reduce the salaries of teachers and staff and other legitimate expenses to balance their income and expenditure.</p>
<p>With such a huge amount of money, even if we calculate the current advertising costs for the winter vacation, if we use it for student loans, each school could add 10 full-tuition students or 20 half-tuition students, which would benefit both the school and the students. According to statistics, there are more than 300 famous schools in Shanghai. If we calculate the total amount of advertising expenses for 50 schools, there would be 500 free students or 1,000 half-tuition students. If the individual funds of each school are added to the salaries of teachers, assuming an average of 14 teachers per school, each teacher could increase their monthly salary by 2,500 yuan. If we compare the advertising costs during the summer and winter vacations, the statistics would be even more impressive.</p>
<p>Looking at the above facts, we can see that most schools in Shanghai are mismanaging their funds. Moreover, the huge expenditure on advertising costs is also a major factor in the increase in tuition. The sharp increase in tuition is directly proportional to the number of students who are dropping out of school. Although tuition increases, the number of students decreases, and the school's economy may not be affluent, the large number of students who are dropping out of school is an undeniable fact. Moreover, there are several loan students in each school whose chances are funded by enthusiastic donors in society. Can the school waste the donations of everyone on unnecessary items? Of course, it shouldn't.</p>
<p>Schools publish enrollment advertisements because it is related to the future of the school itself. If it weren't for this, the number of students would inevitably decrease. After the end of the semester, the school may not be able to maintain itself, so they publish enrollment advertisements. However, because a few schools are profit-oriented, they continue to publish enrollment advertisements on a large scale after the end of the semester. Once this trend starts, others will follow suit and dare not fall behind, creating a competitive situation. Seeing the huge expenditure on advertising costs, it is certainly not their intention. If schools in Shanghai unite and plan to publish enrollment advertisements, they will be able to turn hostility into friendship and turn waste into reality. In my opinion, schools should unite and formulate a plan to publish enrollment advertisements in groups on any day of the week in newspaper A or newspaper B. This will allow readers to have an equal opportunity to find them. The location does not need to be as grand as before. It is only necessary to create an enrollment column in the classified ads. The content should be concise, only listing the class, department, exam date, and school address. Schools with similar characteristics can even publish together. If the above plan can be implemented, advertising costs can be reduced by more than 20 times. The money saved can be used to increase teachers' salaries or directly reduce tuition, which are all good things. The school will not lose anything. On the newspaper side, although they will lose some income, I think the wise newspaper authorities will not hesitate to do so and will not worry about this income. I am writing this in the midst of requests for instructions on tuition standards, hoping that it will be used as a reference and encouragement to make it a reality, which would be a great blessing for students.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association - Merger of Two Institutions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association wrote: "Respected Sirs, after the outbreak of the war, we realized that many children were displaced due to the impact of the war, so we established the Children's Welfare Institute on Bailinan Road to accommodate a large number of homeless children. In addition to education and upbringing, we also provide various production skills. Since its establishment, we have received support from all walks of life. In 1940, in order to meet the actual needs, we established a second institute at 519 Liyuan Road, Nanshi (formerly Huile Garden), which has been in operation for five years. However, our association has no funds. The source of funds depends entirely on the continuous assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. We have benefited endlessly over the years, for which we are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the cost of living has risen sharply, and prices have soared. The number of children in the institute has also increased, and the daily supply is huge. There is often a danger of running out of food. Although our colleagues have tried their best to find resources, there is still a trend of 'difficult to sustain.' Therefore, in order to reduce daily expenses and facilitate operations, we have implemented a merger before Christmas. All the children from the original first institute have been moved to the address of the second institute in Nanshi. In the future, we still hope that charitable people from all walks of life will continue to provide assistance and funding to save these lambs without parents. If you would like to donate money or goods, please send them to the institute on Liyuan Road, Nanchang, and we hope that you will visit the institute at any time to provide guidance."</p>
<h3>Responding to Midwifery</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yangwu wrote: "Respected Sirs, I recently read the news that Mr. Wang Shenglan donated money to benefit poor pregnant women. After admiring it, I deeply feel that this move is indeed necessary, so I specially donate 5,000 yuan to help poor pregnant women at the Huisheng Hospital. Please follow the procedures you have set and have the hospital settle the accounts with you on a monthly basis. Thank you for your trouble."</p>
<h3>Health Association Scheduled to Host Education Community</h3>
<p>At this time of the historian's summer vacation, the general living conditions are poor. According to recent statistics, the spread of tuberculosis in this city is extremely rapid. In view of this, the China Health Association is actively promoting tuberculosis prevention X-ray examinations, promoting them to all walks of life, so that the general public can have early diagnosis and prevent problems before they occur to protect the health of the public. Since its implementation, the work has been very intense, and all parties have provided assistance. The association is scheduled to host the authorities of large, medium, and small schools in this city at the Maggie Mansion at 996 Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM on Sunday, the 7th of this month, to discuss how to promote tuberculosis prevention work, which is very important to public health in various schools.</p>
<h3>Donating to Aid Elementary School Teachers' Medical Expenses: Benefitting the Impoverished</h3>
<p>It is commonly known that elementary school teachers live a meager existence, and their suffering is even more unbearable when they fall ill.</p>
<p>The Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund serves the three areas under our jurisdiction. All elementary school teachers with impoverished family circumstances can apply for registration with this office.</p>
<p>Donating to the Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund allows teachers living in poverty to receive medical subsidies or be referred to designated contracted doctors and hospitals for free treatment, hoping for their speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Effective Remedy for Frostbite: Yang Benyu's administrative management letter states: "To whom it may concern, I suffered from frostbite, which was cured by rubbing camphor and lanolin. A friend's husband also had it, and testing hawthorn also proved effective. Considering that many people suffer from this disease in winter and it easily leads to ulceration and unbearable pain, I am specially spreading this formula in Guangzhou, hoping fellow sufferers will pay attention to it. The formula is as follows: lanolin 10%, camphor 4%, heat into a salve and apply to the affected area."</p>

After active preparations by the hospital's Chairman, President Yongkang, Jin Xuegao, and others, everything is now ready. The hospital will move in for consultation on the 10th of this month. The hospital has specially established free wards for the poor and sick. In addition to the original operating room and electrotherapy room, a large X-ray machine has been added, and specialized doctors from various departments have been additionally hired to benefit the residents of Nanshi.</p>
