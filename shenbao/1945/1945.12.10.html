<p>〔本報收音〕華盛頓九日電，美國副國務卿艾其森，將於明日出席參院外委會之會議，答復赫爾利之談話。按赫爾利曾指艾爲破壞美外交政策之外交人員。參院外委會主席康納利宣佈：赫爾利所提出之指摘，業已不攻自破。康繼謂：國狗卿貝爾納斯對赫爾利之答復，業已證實其本人之意見，認爲母庸再事調查國務院人員。但艾其森應有機會爲其本人辯獲。</p>

<h3>本報倫敦通信　記聯合國文敎會議（上）</h3>
<p>— 余風</p>
<p>王國外長會議在倫敦不歡而散，和平的前途並不盡是康莊。但，這重重荊棘，並不能使一般尋求人類幸福的遠識之士灰心。百年樹人，國際間的相互了解應該從文化交流做起，和平的奠基，應該是在敎育。</p>
<p>抱着這相同的理想，三十九國的敎育文化界聞人，都不遠千里，跋涉到倫敦，預備集思廣益的散下永久和平的種子。</p>
<p>美國代表團浩浩蕩蕩達三十二人之多，有代表，有顧問，有技術秘書，有秘書，助理秘書，還有專管事務的。法國代表團人數雖不及美國多，却是由社會黨黨魁勃魯姆親自出馬，他給總國人監禁了整整五戰，這次還是被釋後第一次在國際會議上露頭角。聽說原來由激進黨領袖赫里歐任首席代表，普選時激進黨在議會裏席次慘跌到十九位，因此他也就朱來出席。英法同時都是邀請國，所以勃魯姆是同等會長（Associate　President）。</p>
<p>會長是英國敎育部部畏魏金斯女士，她是英國工黨的台柱，和拉斯基敎授齊名。開會前夕，她的名字在英國報紙上的頭條消息上出現，倒並不是因爲她要主持這一個會議，而是因爲她在她的故鄉演說，聲稱今冬如碼頭工人罷工不停，恐怕連麵包都要有定量分配危險。這一演說哄動倫敦，議會裏也討論。議員對魏女士的危言聳動大表不滿，魏女士也勇於認過，認爲她並非糧食部部長，不過隨便預測，以後她說話一定大大小心。她在議會陪完不是，再到敎會文化會議來任會長。</p>
<p>危地馬拉·盧森堡·挪威·波蘭·南非·英國·和南斯拉夫·比利時八國，都由敎育部部長任首席代表。國內傳來消息，本說是朱部長要親自出席，牛津大學聞訊，預備以每年只給兩個的榮譽博士學位贈給朱部長，結果朱部長從重慶啓程，到南京而不是到倫敦。牛津大學的榮譽博士位，必須親自接受，本人不來，牛津大學只好歉然的收回了這預備頒給的殊榮。</p>
<p>代理首席代表胡適博士，早已蜚聲國際，他的一篇演說，更使大家覺得名不虛傳，人人稱讚。他演說的那天，印度一位女代表也演說，也博得全塲喝釆，大家認爲那天是亞洲最光榮的一天。</p>
<p>大會的討論，本意是以在倫敦所開敎育部長會議的草案爲本，後來因爲法國也有草案提出，其他國家也有意見，因此合倂討論。</p>
<p>在國聯初成立時，國聯下設的文化合作委員會曾組織一個國際文化合作學院，設在巴黎，法國代表原主張就以這個學院，作爲來日國際敎育文化機關的秘書處，以該院院長任秘書長，意思是要保存這個組織。與會的各國代表，對這一點大都不大贊成。勃魯姆有鑒於此，開大會演說時絕不提起這點，只希望今後的國際敎育文化機構能設在巴黎。這一個提議，英國事光大概已經同意，美國也沒有意見，看樣子會址在巴黎的建議可望通　。</p>
<p>聽說在文化敎育會議前召開預備會議時，美法頗有爭執，但大會中却是異常和洽，也許是國際情勢的演變使然。同盟各國中，蘇聯並未參加，亦沒有人列席，令大家失望。在會塲裏非正式的談話中，都非常爲此惋惜。</p>
<p>關於聯合國敎育文化組織的名稱問題，美國提議要加「科學」兩字，中國代表竭力附議。小組委員會裏已經通過，在原子彈爲舉他矚目，科學合作確乎應該强調。</p>
<p>大會會址在英國的土木工程師學會，一個空寂的會堂，幾排凳子，全沒有一點爲這會議有些輝煌點綴，更沒有「文化合作」一類的標語，四面只有幾塊板，寫着請勿吸烟。凳子前排，有依ABCD排着的國家名字的一塊塊小牌，特爲大會而設的，就只有這一塊塊小木板。中國代表坐在第一排，隔座是智利代表，只有一個人。</p>
<p>大會正式文件中用英法中俄四國文字，會議時，英法語並重。凡是講英語或講法語的都不翻譯，如講英法以外的語言，就要翻譯譯成英語，又譯成法語。主席旁邊，一邊一個講英語翻譯，一面一個法語翻譯，大會有報告，英法語並用。</p>
<p>大會秘書處什麼都管。代表們來開會，衣食都有問題，關於食，秘書處已替他們每人領到一本食糧定量分配簿，可用三星期。關於衣，還沒有領到買衣服必用的「點」。倫敦人工缺少，洗衣店兩星期才能取到，襯衫帶得少的代表，已在鬧襯衫荒。世界教育文化合作問題使他們傷腦筋，但目前更令他們傷腦筋的，還是襯衫問題。（十一月九日倫敦）</p>

<h3>莫斯科三國外長會議　進一步合作先聲　當前重大問題求切實解次　倫敦傳將繼開五外長會議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕下星期六於莫斯科召開之三國外長會議，此間均認爲係應英外相貝文之要求而召開者，按貝文曾指該項會議，爲宣佈各國最高要求之會議，在會議中，各國勢必將乎中之牌攤明桌上。貝文於美國務卿貝爾納斯支持下，將要求蘇外長莫洛托夫宣佈蘇聯於東歐·地中海·伊朗·及太平洋方面之目標。爲酬答蘇聯對其目標之坦白宣示，英美將以原子炸彈之秘密公開。蓋在美總統杜魯門與英首相阿特里之華盛頓會議前，英方發言人曾表示除非穌方當局宣示其對外之意向，原子炸彈之秘密將不任蘇聯預知。此實貴微細之原子，將成爲貝文·貝爾納斯·及莫洛托夫三人自倫敦會議破裂後重集之『國際撲克局』之中心。據悉，貝爾納斯此次赴莫斯科，隨行有原子專家數人，其中包括主管原子炸彈改進之蘭斯禮葛洛夫少　及美著名原子專家范納伐波許博士。此次三國外長會議中，莫洛托夫將作堅執之詢問，蓋蘇聯於太　洋管制方面，久已公開表示不滿，故於共同管制日本一案，當有充分之主張。</p>
<p>各方預測，此次莫斯科會議結束以後，五國外長會議即將相繼舉行。此外長會議將包括中國之王世杰博士及法國之畢多爾在內。英官方對五强會議是否舉行一點，未能予以證實，惟渠等堅稱，白宮方面頗有不久即召集五國外長舉行會談之願望。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕本社駐莫斯科特派員電稱：此間對三强外長將在莫斯科舉行會議之訊，表示歡迎，認爲係屬三强合作之具體證據，對於原子問題之將提時討論，尤感滿意，一般預料若千重大問題於繼續坦白討論後，可有極滿意之收穫。據美國務卿貝爾納斯告知中法駐美大使，謂三强會議對於五國外長會議之職權，不致令其减少，此次三國外長之召集，係根據雅爾達會議之決定，作三强間之部份議決。</p>
<p>討論範圍廣泛</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日電〕此次三國外長會議，將爲解除各大盟國間互相猜疑之初步。據悉：除原子彈及管制日本等問題外，朱來三國外長會議中尙將討論下列各問題：（一）德境之統一管制問題。（二）最後解決領土爭執及戰爭賠償之和平會議計劃。（三）政治問題之解決。（四）蘇聯船隻自由通過達達尼爾海峽問題。（五）三國軍隊撤離伊朗問題。（六）蘇聯之參加管制日本委員會。（七）解決朝鮮局勢。預料上列各問題，將在各方面折衝磋商。一般觀察會議可獲最後協議，蓋初由美國務卿貝爾納斯出面發起，而蘇聯復立即表示贊同，殆即爲有力之證明也。</p>
<p>法國申明立塲</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕載高樂將軍之公署昨發表文告稱：下屆莫斯科會議如僅討論原子彈問題而不涉及法國，則法國雖未被邀參加，亦不擬提出抗議。但如談及與法國有利害關係之問題，而並不徵求法方意見，則法國當不受該次會議之協定，並將提出抗議。</p>

<h3>天津日人戰時暴行　摧殘中國敎育</h3>
<p>〔大華社天津訊〕抗戰期中，日本在津市所施敎育，抱定讀書越少越好宗旨，以摧殘中國靑年之知識。頃據私立北顯小學校長霍明和及市師附小校長劉百章驟稱：平時學生不常上課，祗爲日軍送貨物，或打掃馬路積雪，如有餘暇，則參加遊行，或日本紀念會，中學生除同探參加外，並被迫在工廠或日本空軍基地勞作。至於私立耀華中學，因在舊英租界，戰前學生已有千餘名，自日本佔領津市後，公私立學校不堪壓迫，紛紛轉學　華，該校長趙天麟，頗能鼓勵學生以愛國意識，因此招日軍之怨，即於一九三八年六月二十日在校門口殉難。是可知日本之敎育政策，在乎消滅中國一切愛國敎育工作者。</p>

<h3>社論　工商業登記所引起的問題</h3>
<p>最近這幾天，聽說上海的工廠商號因爲市政府要舉辦工商業的强制登記，引起了許多擬慮，會計師們也在那裏紛紛護諭。其實，工廠登記依據工廠法，原應辦理，中央工商行政的主管部自可委託地方政府舉辦，而商業登記，中央也早有法規，本市在戰前且都依法辦過，此次重行舉辦，在商家司空見慣，只要辦法合理，手續簡便，也未必覺得十分爲難。所當特別注意的，倒是下列各種時間上，手續上，和費用上的問題。</p>
<p>（一）時間問題　社會局於上月杪公告，指定地段，限期於本月五日以前，領取表式，十日以前，依式塡報，每一階段，各定爲五日。商界對此未免認爲太促。因爲商業登記之對象，乃是獨資與合夥組織，而公司不在其列，其中以小規模的商號和手工塲居其多數。他們的人手既少，智識又比較淺薄，甚至常年不定報或不閱報的，也往往而有。假定其經理人偶因事故他往，究應如何填報，其夥友或家屬勢或窮於應付。因此主張酌予延長，以期减少困難，實在不無理由。如果商業登記依照中央法令，仍是自由登記性質，則限期雖促或無大碍，因爲登記與否悉聽自便，否則如變爲强制，不登記須停業，則限期更應延長。但官應方面，爲什麽定得這樣短促，迄今尙未見有何說明。以意度之，既經分期分區舉辦，以上海地面之大，商業之盛，如果每一段落，過於延遲，不免影響到全部工作的完成。這雖是一種揣測，似乎也不中不遠。不過為顯全商情起見，我們仍希望能酌予延長。</p>
<p>（二）公會代辦問題　因爲限期太促，領表的人，發生了排隊和鵠候的痛苦，於是有一部份公會，便自告奮勇了。他們打算，由公會墊款出來，　批地領了表去，再發給同業，分頭填報。這自然是一種好意和合作。假使此次工商業登記的用意，不在於權利的保護，而在於官應要得到調查統計的材料，那麽由公會代辦的方法們乎很可以接受。因爲如此辦理，一可以减少商家的麻煩，二可以减輕官廳的手續，三可以增加同業對於公會的聯繫和信仰，而於法令上也並無絲毫抵觸。所謂一舉而數善備，又何樂而不爲。</p>
<p>（三）彙總塡報問題　進一步，再由公會彙總代報，這在登記人自無問題，而在社會局恐也未必不願意接受。因爲個別的收受，與彙總的收受，在手續上宜無多大差別。</p>
<p>（四）繳費問題　工商業登記所繳的登記費用，依法須繳入市庫，而且統收統支，速局方代收統解也辦不到。聽說，爲了這個問題，主管當局也曾盡了最大的努力。最初希望辦到代收統解，以免商家往返跋涉的痛苦，但是格於定章，無法通融。不得已而思其次，乃有請求市庫派員駐局，就近收款的代替辦法。這也算是仁至義盡的了。這個辦法，於統收統支的原則，毫無違背，而在商人方面，却可以免去許多轉折和麻煩，或許在事實上總是可能的吧。那麽，　總報解這件事，似乎也可以迎帶地考慮了。</p>
<p>（五）費用問題　這個問題，就相當的嚴重了。現行辦法，的確，比舊章高了許多，而且是累進制。所謂小計不足，大計有餘。所以商界方面，就有種種議論和呼籲，希望當局酌予核减，以蘇商困。在商言商，也是情理上應有的舉動。平心而論，現在百物高昂，幣値低落，如果拿舊章來衡量，那也未免太不相稱。况且公司登記規則第十條所定的登記費用，也是採取累進制，當局此次規定，未嘗沒有根據。不過兵　以來，瘡痍滿目，商業凋敝，辦理登記，其目的又不在收入，倘能俯順與情，酌量减輕，也未始不是一件德政。</p>
<p>（六）資本額的塡報問題　這個問題，本報已有專篇論刋。市商會因爲沒有奉到部令的指示，而此間工商業的登記又定有限期，迫不得已，乃召集各業常委，議定了一個假定的辦法，衡情酌理，可稱煞費苦心。不過謹愼的人，依舊還有兩點過慮。其一，填載不實，照章要受處分的。其二，資本額與抽稅有關，過多過少，均不無窒碍。所以有一部份人，現在還在觀望着。在這個特殊的時候，來解決這個特殊的糾紛，實在並無十分團滿的辦法。我們只有希望工商業的主管當局和稅收當局，情法兩全，力持寬大，不必過於嚴格的了。</p>
<p>總之，勝利以來，中央屢次昭告國人，要休養生息，與民史始，而對收復區尤有「收復人心」的指示，這無非要刧後餘黎，獲得一個昭蘇的機會。所以舉辦工商登記，無論時間上，手續上，和費用上種種問題，大凡可以便利商界和减輕商民痛苦的，我們極希望官廳方面能體卹商艱，予以最大的容忍。在上海如此，在內地也如此。而同時，我們也希望商民恪遵法令，據實填報，不要遲擬觀望，稽延了這一件人民與政府應該合作的工作。</p>

<h3>增强華中各路運輸　美運新機車來滬　計共二十個自波斯灣啓運　將於一個月內在酸奶埠卸下</h3>
<p>〔本報專訊〕最新式美國火車機頭二十　，已由聯合國善後救濟總署裝運來華，不日即將抵滬。此項機頭抵滬後，即將撥交華中谷鐵路，以充實運輸力量。</p>
<p>陳伯荘談</p>
<p>據華中鐵路管理委員會負責人陳伯荘語本報記者：目前鐵道運輸困難，　結在機頭不够分配。在日人經營時代，大部機頭皆因使用過度，修理不力而損毀，本會接收之機頭十九皆需修理，而目前因材料缺乏，修理工作又不能推展。以致實際能用之機頭分配極形困難。因此今日華中鐵路運輸已陷於有車無車頭，有車頭無煤之境。最近由美運來之機頭到滬後，即將撥交各鐵路以補救目前迫切之需要。</p>
<p>備起重機</p>
<p>另據此間美海軍愛露，備有美國海軍最大船上起重機之「阿巴頓」號，將於一個月內在本埠碼頭開始卸下由美運華之火車車頭二十個。此項車頭現正由自由輪自波斯灣裝載來滬，每個計重九十噸。「阿巴頓」號起重機之舉重量爲一百六十噸，故應付不成問題。承辦此項工作者，爲交通部華中鐵路管理委員會，該委會將派工程師兩名，協助辦理卸貨事宜。</p>

<h3>外報傳滬日人　作地下活動</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處訊〕據紐約時報駐滬通訊員雷伯曼昨日報告稱：目下滬上日方地下工作，因監察不嚴而趨忙碌。日方前秘密工作人員及宣傳人員，刻正以日僑之身份，居於虹口，獲得極多機會，興自行管理之日軍人集中營通消息。華方當局雖已規定管理日俘暨日僑辦法，但於目下日人等待撤退之時，竟缺乏監護。實際上日軍被囚者，與業人間之唯一聯絡者，即多半前曾任日方軍官之聯絡員五十名。渠等均着平民衣服，而居於集中營之外。虹口入十萬之日僑，刻正由其本國機關管理。此間之日俘集中營，與一般外間同一性質之機構，無一相似之處。余曾詢間某華軍長官以華方監護何在，渠答云：「吾人並無監護兵，監護之舉並不安全，日人實太多耳。」雷氏引湯恩伯將軍之言曰，滬上日軍除尙有五千名未繳械外，餘均已繳械。日僑居滬寗二地者有九十萬名，僅二千名已返國。被囚日軍無一已撤退至日本者。日僑臂纏白布條，但欲獲派司而出離集中區則甚易。日僑集中以家庭爲單位，而由前日總領總其事。其中包括軍人派民主派及少數共黨徒三種，其陰謀爭　之事頗有所聞。其中龐於軍人派者則反對宣傳民主。</p>

<h3>正中書棧火警　毀書籍三萬册</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕本市天潼路一六七號正中書局上海分局書棧八日晚九時半發生火警，經消防隊撲滅，該處爲四開間前後進樓房，戰時本爲敵營上海圖書有限公司之總辦事處，戰爭勝利後正中書局十月三十日奉命前往接收使用時，由虹口警察分局派警會同前往，當時警局對條業已破裂，該局除向警局請求追查外，並已分別呈報中央宣傳部詹特派員及上海區敵僞產業處理局備案。嗣後該處即作爲上海分局職員宿舍及臨時書棧之用。八日下午九時半，後進樓房中間起火時，即經本市消防隊前往灌救，歷時甚暫，即行撲滅，計焚燬房間三問，內床舖四副，中等敎科畫及參考書約三萬冊，（依批發價估値約三百五十萬元）戰前舊課本紙型約四十副，又少數日常用具若干。該局總局之書庫及紙棧並不在此處，故損失尙輕，走火原因，據前晚到塲之救火會及警局人員會勘，認爲該處後進樓房之天花板及牆壁，均爲日僑居住時用紙板裝裱，極易引火，加以電綫過舊，故走電起火之可能性甚大。事後該局並已分請警察局及敵僞　業處理局派員到塲寳地勘察。</p>

<h3>社會服務　速籌救濟事業</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>辦社會服務事業，主要目標，當然在謀人民福利，但是這項工作，範圍廣大，同時需要的條件太多，在目前政治未上軌道，辦起來難期奏效，是可想而知的。那末不得已而求其次，着手於救濟事業，當屬過渡的辦法。事實上，經過八年抗戰，民間慘痛程度，比前更加深重，亟待救濟，十分迫切。舉凡廣大的失業羣衆如何使能獲得工作？貧病者如何使其就診施藥？無父無母的孤兒，如何使其得到敎養之所？老弱無靠者如何終其餘年？殘廢者如何得到收容之處？此外，嚴冬已臨，施衣施粥如何實行？這都是屬於救濟範圍，應該迅速辦理的。我們認爲人間慘象，雖屬於「自作孽」的很多，但受到戰爭的影響畢竟是主要原因，而且嚴重性是非常普遍的。所以我們估計目前的救濟工作，需要的人力物力，一定非常龐大，不能單靠本市原有的慈善機關所能為力，而是必須得到社會上有力的人士協力推動，才能收到普遍的效果。同時我們認爲在抗戰期中，滬上根本不曾受過痛苦的人們，希望他們想想「憂患餘生，何等僥倖」！那末對於當前的救濟事業上，出一點力，捐一點錢，算得了什麽呢？尤其是在國難時期，曾經掀風作浪，發國難財的人們，現在應該反省過去實在太違背良心，太對不起國家人民，那末對於常前的救濟事業，趕快盡最大的力量，實是「將功贖罪」的最好機會。等社會上悲慘的景象不復存在，人民才眞有福利可言。</p>

<h3>失去徐志摩的陸小曼</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>每次和朋友們談起新詩問題，便不約而同地大家爲詩人徐志摩先生的早死深深惋惜！誰也知道他是中國新詩前期的巨星，他的創作使中國詩壇放射出燦爛的光彩，但是，他的殞落也使中國的詩壇從此褪了色！</p>
<p>爲了哀念志摩先生的原故，同時不免關心到失去志摩的陸小曼女士！自從志摩光生故後，小曼女士則再不曾爲文問世，由此可以想見她的生活情緒之一般！因此，在重慶就決定了，到上海必須慰問她。</p>
<p>半月前曾寫了封信給她，原說就去看她的，而且她的復函，也熱烈地盼我速去，却因一直沒有時間，加以情緒的不安寗，去看她也無從談起。</p>
<p>今天是一個最好的日子，雖然冷，下午却出了太陽。冷，澄淸了我忙亂的心情；太又引起我出去走走的興趣，於是放下筆，決定訪這位也許已經被人遺忘了的陸小曼女士。</p>
<p>福煦路上，特別蕭條，車馬稀少，人行道上唯有落葉狼藉，寂寞無聲欲斷魂，我不禁悄悄地說聲：這正是詩人住的環境。</p>
<p>及抵陸宅，叩環良久，才出來一個北方口音的女傭，予以名片，說明我是專誠來幷訪陸女士的，她遂引導我進入一二層樓的客廳。客廳相當大，陳設古老，書香氣氛頗濃，一張長方的畫桌上筆墨顏料塔亂地散置着，案頭舖了幅剛剛續就的山水，後來知道這便是小曼女士在上海日以繼夜，年復一年的唯一消遣。案面嵌有玻璃板，底下押了一張志摩先生的便裝照片，他是躺在一塊草地上的，手裏還拿了一枝香烟，瀟洒出塵，神情活現，我們可以想像到小曼女士雖然在作畫的時候，也還需要志摩先生的遺影伴着她，安慰她。</p>
<p>四壁滿是書畫，照片左壁角懸了一幀小曼女士年靑時的放大像，和她斜度相對的左壁正中，懸了一張男子放大像，這一望而知就是我們的詩人徐志摩先生了。人亡影在，看了令人肅然起敬，不勝悲悼之至！</p>
<p>大概有一根烟的功夫，樓上才有脚步聲，接着是陸小曼女士微笑着走進客廳。</p>
<p>她雖然穿了一件很厚的黑羊皮袍，仍遮蓋不了她搜弱的身材，她的面色蒼白，看來無可諱言地她是在患着貧血症。她毫未修飾，這說明了她的心境，但她依然是美麗的，宛如一朶幽蘭，嫻靜而超然地藏匿在深谷中。</p>
<p>『我等了你這麼久不來，還以爲是我的信沒有寄到呢？』她握着我的手熱情地說。</p>
<p>『很抱歉，因爲忙亂，拖到現在才來看您，』眞的，我這時的心裏，確實感到歉然，我後悔沒有早來。</p>
<p>『近來身體好些了嗎？』</p>
<p>『噢，不！差不多一年病到頭，前幾天還不能起床，要不然我早去看你了！』</p>
<p>她說罷坐在我的身邊，這一下我發現她有一雙充滿了憂鬱的限睛，她彷彿怕看見光，她時時躲避向太陽反射的地方。</p>
<p>『我有許多年不邁出大門一步了，也可以說有許多年沒有見太陽了。』</p>
<p>她明白我在注意她這種過分悲戚的神情，所以她很快地自我解釋：她覺得這些年來人情和世態變得太利害，太陽原是要照出善良與熱誠的鏡子，既然失去這個效能，那麼他的光芒是殘廢的，所以她寗願讓黑暗與陰冷包圍她，使她漸漸由習慣而麻木了，除了她的這幢小樓是她的天地，小樓外面的一切與她無關，她也不屑於問聞了。</p>
<p>但是陸女士却關懷她的一些留在內地的老朋友，她說：</p>
<p>『在上海簡直沒有朋友，於是每天在絕對寂寞中度過，上午睡覺，下午起來看看收，作作畫，夜間便通宵伴着孤燈抽烟，噴霧；讓烟霧迷茫了整個心靈。』</p>
<p>說到這裏，她忽然問到王雲五先生，她告訴我：</p>
<p>『我沒有什麼希望了，我只想迅速看見「志摩全集」的出版，這些年來，我所念念不能忘的也只有這件事，這便是志摩死後我唯一的工作，可是這件事猶如石沉大海，書既不見問世，迎消息也一點沒有了。談到這裏，我告訴你一個奇異的夢。』</p>
<p>她開始興奮地叙述着潛伏在她心的深處的一堆辛酸。</p>
<p>『我開始編輯「志摩全集」的時候，有一天晚上，我夢見了志摩，淸淸晰晰地，他還像活着一樣的洒脫，聰明的神氣，我彷彿在書案上看他的稿子，他從我的背後走過來，拍拍我說：「我眞感激你，你這樣辛苦地爲我編全集，可是這不是一件簡單的事：你不必太熱心了，尤其不能抱過大的希望」，我聽了他的話不明白，我問他：「爲什麼？」他笑了笑說：「人在世情在，人亡世情亡，全集的材料不全，你必須求朋友帮忙，這就會使你失望，我可以告訴你：日記一部份，需要三年功夫；小說有一本永遠沒有辦法；再加上其地種種原因，恐怕九年以後才能成功，不信，你等着瞧吧！」當時我眞的不信，所以醒後我一點不以爲然。我仍舊積極地工作，直到後來，甚而直到現在我才完全相信了，事實果然不錯，志摩在世是智慧過人的，死後依然智慧過「人」！』</p>
<p>她頓了頓，燃着一支烟，但却不去吸完，烟在她手裏發抖，烟火的微光裹我看見她在無聲地飲泣。</p>
<p>『全集材料經我東懇西求地搜獲了不少，但却只缺日記三本和翻譯小說一本，日記是志摩唯一未經發表的東西，志摩死後，志摩生前的一位好朋友，把日記借去看，可是躭擱了三年之久才還我，這一點是應騐了志摩的話。小說原在胡適之先生處，後來又落到沈從文先生那裏，這樣轉來轉去，遂告失踪，好在總算凑張，呌我交給商務印書館印行。抗戰前一年訂的約，迄今八年了也不知道遣失了呢？還是王雲五先生覺得志摩已死，讀者早遺忘了他的名字，因而著作沒有生意經，不願再出版了？這又是應騐志摩的話的第二點。大概他所指的『其他原因』，便是抗戰吧！他的靈魂竟有先知之明，由於這一件事的挫折，我才明白了所謂：「人在世情在，人亡世情亡」的眞理了。』</p>
<p>她把那枝香烟狠狠地吸了幾口，我一直注意地聽她講話，看她們動作，我的心跟着她撩起無限煩惱與感慨！</p>
<p>『志摩死了十四年了，』她一字一字沉重地吐出這句含着淚的話。『十四年的世界上再沒有了他，也永遠毀了我！』</p>
<p>她不再講下去了，我這時隱約聽得見她的心在急跳，她的呼吸有些不自然。</p>
<p>我安慰她說：</p>
<p>『全集一定要出，王雲五先生不印，可交別家印，儘管書店老闆看它已褪了金色，但中國文壇是視它爲珍實的，志摩先生是不會被人遺忘的，他將長生在讀者的記憶裏！</p>
<p>我並且勸她：</p>
<p>『春天就要到了，一切都將開始新興，希望您也從此振作起來，老悶在屋子裏對身體無益，應當盡可能多出去走走，甚而跑得遠一些，因爲遊歷也是煥發精神的良藥。</p>
<p>她接受了我的意見，而且很感動地向我許下願，最近便開始走出她的小樓，到我這裏來，然後她的老朋友們都陸續蒞滬了，她再各處跑跑，這樣，我想她會不難恢復健康，也不難喚回愉快的心境！</p>
<p>爲了怕她太累，便站起來告辭，走出大門，已是黃昏日暮，再踏着一洛葉，踱回歸途，心情比來時沈重，一路悄悄祝福着失去徐志摩先生的陸小曼女士！</p>

<p>這個年頭兒說到朋友，實在令人覺得完全全只有『空虛』和『迷惘』！小孩子從學校中放學回家，跳着嚷着一會兒唱着『好朋友！好朋友，大家牽了手！』然而一會他們又爭吵起來了；眞會使老年人覺得有此惱怒，但是這祇有拿『沈默』來對付，給他們一個不理不睬，顯然的這是老年人應付一切煩惱的絕妙方法。</p>
<p>說起朋友：『朋友您望開兒想吧。』比你高一級的，他祗有拿『混賬忘八蛋』來敎訓你這朋友。你要想『報復』，那只有拿這『混賬忘八蛋』去向比你地位低一級的朋友頭上套去。倘使沒有比你再低的朋友了，那只好向家中去找那靠你養活的那一羣拖鼻涕的孩子來出這一口惡氣！</p>
<p>『混賬！』究竟「混』的是那一筆『賬』呢？當然這年頭兒大家要想朋友一陶『混混』，只有到處賣『賬』，什麽呌做朋友，不不是大家『混混』而已！</p>
<p>你的『上級』駡了你；你再轉賑去駡『下級』這樣大家賣『賬』，這才可以『混混』。就拿你家中拖鼻涕的孩子來說吧，他們也並不寃枉，誰呌他沒有帶了鈔票就來出世呢，吃一口飯，喝一口粥，本來就應該『記賬』的，小朋友：『賬』而能『混』，已落得便宜了！</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>上週金融商業回顧　公債獨漲物價疲落</h3>
<p>金融　上週本市金融，銀根續鬆，千元日息平定於三角，暗息因物價跌風威脅，市民重幣輕貨，囤戶斥貨易鈔，不復高利借實，價由一角三分退至一角，即千元月息百元。烚赤初站七十八萬元高峯，旋因華北及東九省時局樂觀，國際自由貿易將開始，暨英美借款協定成立，滬外商銀行復業，賣戶紛起，市價步跌，週五低峯到七十六萬三千元，最後因重慶金價尙站八十四萬餘元，套買與獲利補空者多，回漲至六十八萬三千元收盤，比前週尙跌九萬四千元。紋銀呆定於六百五十元，銀幣因鄉農有易米需要，由四百二十元挺升至四百五十五元，美鈔因外商銀行復業，外匯不久恢復，進出口商不必再囤美鈔抵解，執貨者心意懈淡，貿金套　美鈔者壓力加重，週尾低峯到一千零六十元，最後收盤一千零九十元，較前週大跌二百十八元。</p>
<p>證劵　自中共聲明不阻止中央接收東北後，統一公債買戶興奮，統內且有軋空風說，價由四百零五元狂升至六百十元，最後雖因多頭獲利了結，猝降至五百四十元收盤，仍比前週漲十五元，目前執統債者有一種幻想，即以關金償還本息是。華股大都有偽幣增資關係，須嚴行整理，且不能過戶，新買戶奇缺，熱門大小股均落，外股因金價跌風暗示，及外商復業後受中國法律支配，新買戶觀望，怡和紗廠股跌二百八十元，爲一千四百元，會得豐亦由四千二百元退至三千五百元</p>
<p>貨物　商品方面，食米因蕪湖·內地，及台灣米到，益以第三方面軍移錫，太湖產米地區治安進步，　戶不復盲囤，價乃步降，星期四厚粳一度跌至六千元，客秈且小至五千元，最後因內地米價告昂，復站住七千元（秈米）至八千元，（粳米）仍比前週跌一千元。麵粉因救濟粉麥大宗運滬，即將舉行公開平賣，益以米價廉於麵粉，一號粉每包四十九磅價由三千三百元退至二千六百元，食油靑島·蚌埠·常州·到貨不絕，囤戶求售，一度發見一萬五千元低峯後，因食戶與本街油行添取，回站一萬九千元，食糖因海關平賣價提高，及台灣糖不能自由輸出，買價興化白糖萬由四八千元升至五萬元，廿四號粗砂且漲五千元，爲六萬元。原棉因美棉立定二角四五分，金便與美鈔大跌後，採算價益廉，華棉大受刺激，通州美種棉由七萬元猛跌至五萬五千元，浦東火機花小至三萬元，周浦籽花僅售五千元，比前週獨跌二千元。棉紗長江方面稍有去路，惟因原棉日廉，支持乏力，比前週跌八萬至四十八萬元，人心疲軟，綢廠有工潮，生絲廠需甚呆，高級廠經已跌進一百萬元大關，輯里干經祗四十一萬元。人造絲一百二十號天橋猛跌二十萬元，突見十月下旬來新低峯三十八萬元。燃料水陸到貨絡繹，白煤每噸價由三十三萬元退至二十七萬元，但零售價並未鬆動，總之，凡百物價均在大跌小回中也。（重伯）</p>
<h3>丙種何以獨漲</h3>
<p>近來本市一般物價步跌，惟有公債反扶搖直上，雖說是受了以新通貨整理，及銀元還本等種種流言所刺激，但同樣是統一公債，爲什麽甲種僅有丙種的一半價値呢？陪都不是繼續抽籤還本嗎！改用法幣喊價之後，竟狂抬到票面五倍以上，雖說是擁護國信，但另一方面却壓低了法幣信用，如果要追求其在漲的理由，有何根據，我想還是來談一談公債賣買的交易方式，來得簡明些。</p>
<p>現下的公債賣買，並無正式合法塲所，從事公債賣買的號家，也不過三十餘家，通常集合在證交七樓走廊中，採取現貨交割制度，但賣方所交之貨，必須連有三十一年度息票者，同時票面在千元以下，或略有汚損者拒收，據估計每天成交總數，不過票面一千萬元左右，其中半數以上是丙種，三成以上是戊種，甲乙丁不到二成，最熟門的丙種，以六百元之價格計，約値法幣三千萬元左右，祗須黄金四十餘條，即可操縱整個債市，何况上海有的是瘋狂的散戶，金融界方面所有的公債，在敵人進佔租界後，大部均已西遷，那末要求連同三十一年度息票的公債，事實上有限得很，何况尙有種種挑剔。</p>
<p>公債賣買交割，既有上述種種限制，業外的人，如果根據經濟學理，貿然來放空一下，那末午時三刻（收盤時），在業中人操縱壟斷之下，便軋得透不過氣來，除非當局對遺留在淪陷區的公債息票，限期補領，否則他們會繼續珍若拱璧，那末，目前五倍的價格，又算得了什麼呢。（敬之）</p>
<h3>賬面資本額與稅收</h3>
<p>— 小回</p>
<p>帳面資本額之由僞幣折爲法幣，二百折一也好，二折一也好，祇是在帳簿上减少幾個「〇」的問題。就企業本身講：資產是資產，帳面是帳面，帳面的增减不會影響到資產的增减。因此，股東對於公司可得而主張權利的比例，無論是怎麽樣的折，總還是一樣的。</p>
<p>政府爲體恤淪區人民，而有偽幣二百折法幣一元的命令，是純指通貨而說的。對於帳面資本之宜如何折合，並無明令。故「帳面資本之宜二百折一」一說，係出於上項命令推定，而不是强行規定。所以，二百折一，固然不能說他沒根據，二折一甚至一合一也絕無違抗法令的地方。</p>
<p>不過，帳面資本的析合與帳面盈餘有極大的關聯。因爲以僞幣為計算單位的物價，與以法幣為計算單位的物價，並非與通貨的折合率同其比率。　所得稅和利得稅之計徵係按盈餘與資本之比例，而定其徵收率的。故如帳面資本而必需以二百折一，則何店無存貨？何貨不在二百折一比率之上？是年終結帳，又何帳而不將琳瑯滿目？</p>
<p>稅收之增加，對於政府財政，固然大有裨益。但是此項盈餘，究竟是虛的，以虛盈而完實稅，姑毋論竭澤之漁，是否爲八載剝削之餘的民間工商業所擔負得起，即在政府，方且以扶掖民間經濟爲意，當亦不至出此。</p>
<p>且假設當初政府根本不理會僞幣，僞幣自都成廢紙，則硬要以通貨與帳而資本混爲一談的話，難道現在的工商業資本也就應統統折成個「〇」字？公司資產之現値在帳面上表現時，難道全部作爲盈餘？</p>
<p>所以，帳面資本之整理，非可一概而論，更非通貨之折合率可以移用。關鍵所在，是個虛盈實稅的問題，在購買力普遍跌落，工商業無力復興的今天，筆者請以「闢源不如養源」一語貢諸政府。</p>
<h3>杭州綢價狂跌</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州九日電〕杭州素以出產絲綢著名，戰後廠家幾已全部復業，產銷亦暢，茲悉日來市價，以受各種物價下瀉影響，在跌四分之一，買賣淸淡，似有續跌趨勢。</p>

<h3>National Army Awaits Orders to Enter Shenyang; Changchun Negotiations Near Conclusion; Transportation Restored Between Harbin and Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th] The Sino-Soviet negotiations are still in progress. Our chief representative is General Xiong Shihui, and the focus of the negotiations is in Chongqing and Changchun. Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, will return to Moscow to report on his duties after the negotiations reach an agreement. The National Army's takeover of the Northeast is a matter of internal affairs. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Agreement in August, both parties have already reached a common foundation on general principles. The National Army's airlift and entry into the Northeast along the Beining Railway are local technical issues. It is heard that the results of the airlift negotiations will be announced in the coming days. Previous reports of the Soviet army disarming the communist forces in Changchun have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] Reliable sources this morning reported that Sino-Soviet negotiations on the National Army's airlift to Changchun and the land forces entering Shenyang are being held in Changchun and are nearing completion today. Some points have not yet been resolved, but it is expected that Special Envoy for Northeast Diplomacy, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Marshal Malinovsky will be able to handle these issues properly within a few days. General Du Yuming's troops are very close to Shenyang, but are still waiting for the Soviet Union's "green light" to avoid any unforeseen circumstances. It is said that the Soviet Union is currently guarding Shenyang, and the Chinese authorities here are insisting on a peaceful and bloodless reoccupation of the city, which is very likely. After arriving in Chongqing on Friday, General Du met with Chairman Chiang yesterday, and it is believed that they discussed the Northeast issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] Changchun has had sunny weather for several days, and the city is calm. Communist troops no longer appear in public in the city. The Soviet army is also strictly cracking down on soldiers with improper attire. Communist troops along the Changchun Railway have been ordered to withdraw. The Changchun Railway, from Harbin in the north to Dalian in the south, was opened to traffic on the 25th of last month. There is more passenger traffic than freight traffic. The Sino-Soviet Changchun Railway Board of Directors and Supervisors is located in Changchun, and the Railway Bureau is located in Harbin. Three of our five directors have arrived, but all supervisors are missing. Four of the five Soviet directors have arrived, and all supervisors have arrived. Both parties have now begun working.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Radio Reception] A Chongqing spokesperson claimed that there was indeed collusion between the Chinese Communist Party and Zhang Xueshi. It is said that Zhang Xueshi has accepted Zhu De's order to withdraw troops from Shenyang in order to preserve the strength of the communist forces. General Du Yuming has reported this matter to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] More than two hundred staff members of the Northeast Headquarters and its affiliated administrative personnel are still in Chongqing and are scheduled to be airlifted to Beiping before the 20th of this month. In addition, Sheng Zizhuang, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Northeast Headquarters, has been dispatched to Chongqing to handle the closing affairs of the Chongqing office and will return to Beiping in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Removed from Baotou Suburbs; Area Within Fifty Li Completely Cleared; Some Communist Troops in West Tianjin Surrender with Weapons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guihua, 9th] More than 20,000 communist troops have besieged Baotou for more than a month without success. Recently, they have become enraged out of shame and have engaged in large-scale arson and slaughter. Fires have raged for days, and residents who did not have time to escape were burned to death, which is too horrible to hear.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The area within fifty li of the suburbs of Baotou has been completely cleared. The communist troops have moved eastward and southward. According to observation, one group moving eastward seems to be attacking Guihua Province again, and one group moving southward seems to be heading to Qingshuihe and Helin to seek contact with the communist forces in northwest Shanxi. In addition, communist troops have been looting goods and livestock in the suburbs of Guihua for days,抢transporting grain to Liangcheng, apparently to support the activities of the communist forces in Datong, northern Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Du Pinsan, a representative of the people of Suiyuan Province, said that the communist troops had reinforced their siege of Suiyuan and Baotou five times, and the blockade had lasted nearly two months. Food and fuel were running out, and the 300,000 people in the two cities would either die from artillery fire or from freezing and starvation. More than ten groups in Suiyuan Province have sent telegrams in tears of blood, requesting assistance. In addition, Commander Fu specially ordered the troops to reduce their rations and allocated more than 100,000 jin of miscellaneous grains to relieve the citizens.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Since the National Army entered West Tianjin, some communist troops have repented of their past mistakes and have surrendered to the National Army with their weapons. So far, the National Army has obtained 200 guns, which will be allocated to the people to strengthen their self-defense forces. The surrendered communist troops will be sent back to their hometowns separately so that they can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Communist Troops in Henan Establish Central China Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luohe, 9th] The Headquarters of the 12th Military Region of the communist forces convened a meeting of its main cadres in Tai Kangbei on the 3rd, and decided: (1) To strongly control the Longhai and Jinpu Railways to prepare for the North China War. (2) If the North China War begins and is won, a winter offensive will be launched.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luohe, 9th] Communist troops in the Henan and Hubei area have recently implemented emergency measures and have been completely transformed into a state of combat. The Tenth Branch of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University was closed last month, and cadres with injuries, illnesses, and ideological doubts were secretly escorted north of the Yellow River for resettlement. In addition, the communist forces in southern Henan established the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party to unify the command of communist forces south of the Yellow River. Zheng Weisan has been appointed as the secretary of the Central China Bureau, and the command area includes the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Communist Troops in Southern Shandong Change Designations</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Southern Shandong, 9th] Communist troops in Shandong have recently changed their designations. According to investigations, the Central Shandong Military Region has been renamed the First Route, the Binhai Military Region has been renamed the Second Route, the Jiaodong Military Region has been renamed the Third Route, the Bohai Military Region has been renamed the Fourth Route, and the Southern Shandong Military Region has been renamed the Fifth Route. A total of eight divisions of the People's Liberation Army, eleven garrison brigades, and four independent brigades have been formed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Southern Shandong, 9th] The main force of the communist troops entrenched in the mountains northeast of Lincheng is attempting to take the opportunity to attack the National Army positions in Hongxuanwa, Silishi, and other areas, and is constructing fortifications towards the National Army positions. In addition, the communist troops near Liguo Station have repeatedly harassed the National Army positions without success and have mostly withdrawn to the north bank of the Grand Canal. Only a small number of communist troops are still lurking in the villages on both sides of the railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] According to related sources: (1) Wang Hongjiu, the commissioner of the Third District, who was besieged by communist troops in northwest Linqu for many days, led his troops to break through the encirclement and arrived near Zaozhuang, where they were besieged again and are still fighting fiercely. (2) The communist troops continue to attack Taozhuang with intense artillery fire and have charged into the city twice, but were repelled. However, the communist offensive does not seem to be stopping.</p>

<h3>First Batch of Repatriated Chinese Military and Civilians Who Labored in Japan Arrive in Qingdao by Ship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] The first batch of 1,955 Chinese military and civilians who were captured by the Japanese army and forced to work in Japan during the Anti-Japanese War arrived in Qingdao from Tobata on the 5th aboard the Chennichi Maru. There are more than 200 former soldiers, nearly 400 puppet soldiers, and more than 900 laborers. Fifty people are sick. They were monitored and labored in Japan for as long as four years, digging tunnels underground, never seeing the light of day, and often not having a full meal for several days. Their clothing was not made of cotton; they were only issued a set of clothes made of cement powder and paper. When they were rescued by the American army before returning home, they knew nothing about the Japanese surrender. When the Allied forces told them the truth, they burst into tears and congratulated each other.</p>
<h3>Hunan Relief Branch Allocates Funds for Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 9th] The Hunan Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has proposed 50 million yuan for emergency relief, which will be distributed to the affected counties and cities in conjunction with the Hunan Provincial Government and the Provisional Senate. The severity of the disaster will be determined by the extent of the occupation area, the length of the occupation time, and the intensity of the enemy-own battles. The disaster situation in Changsha and Hengyang is particularly severe, and 2.5 million yuan will be allocated to each city. Yueyang and Linxiang were occupied the longest, and an additional 1 million yuan will be allocated to each city in addition to the allocated amount.</p>

<h3>Xu Zhen Talks About Governance Guidelines: Prioritize Restoring Order and Stabilizing Hearts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 8th] A Central News Agency reporter visited Liao Ning Province Chairman Xu Zhen after he entered Jinzhou and asked about his governance guidelines. Xu said that the current priority is to restore order and stabilize people's hearts, such as rushing to repair poles and lines for telegraphs, and using radio for reporting in the meantime. City telephones and long-distance telephones will be repaired as soon as possible. In addition to military vehicles, the railway will resume passenger and freight cars, and discussions have been completed with the responsible personnel. Xu continued that he himself is also assisting the air force station in various ways to make proper arrangements, and has instructed the police bureau to assist. Primary and secondary schools will resume classes immediately, and factories and mines will be ordered to resume work immediately. Essential components that have been transported away or destroyed by the communist forces will be repaired as quickly as possible. In any case, work will be resumed in the current state to increase production. As for household registration, land registration, police, sanitation, and other matters, the effective practices of the past may still be adopted, and those that do not conform to the people's sentiments will be corrected. Moreover, exorbitant taxes will be eliminated immediately. The people of Jinzhou are becoming more and more stable, and county magistrates and mayors temporarily dispatched by the Commander-in-Chief's Office are instructed to continue to serve. There is a system in the Northeast called "荷出", which means transporting all agricultural products to Japan as much as possible, so that the people of the Northeast are often not full at every meal.</p>
<h3>Shandong Guerrilla Forces Thoroughly Reorganized; Expected to be Completed by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] More than one hundred units of guerrilla forces throughout the province, which have supported the situation in Shandong for eight years during the Anti-Japanese War, are now being thoroughly reorganized and are expected to be completed by the end of December. These guerrilla forces have made contributions to the Anti-Japanese War. However, the development situation in the past eight years has been complicated, with numerous designations and large organizations. After the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Eleventh War Zone arrived in Jinan, it began to reorganize them. It was decided to reorganize them according to three principles: (1) Reorganize them into local teams. (2) Allocate them to established units in Shandong. (3) Establish several independent regiments and one security regiment under the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office. Each county will have a security brigade, all under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Security Office. The original designations of Advance Column, Security Brigade, Security Regiment, Special Service Brigade, and Special Service Regiment will all be abolished. In addition, the designations of some miscellaneous troops that have long been reorganized or no longer exist have also been explicitly abolished.</p>
<h3>National Army Searches for Guerrilla Bandits in Villages Between Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 9th] The National Army is currently searching for guerrilla bandits in villages between Beiping and Tianjin. These bandits are obstructing the transportation of food into the city and must be eliminated. The troops have arrived in Langfang (120 li from Tianjin) and have not encountered resistance. The bandits have fled at the sight of the National Army. Other National Army troops have arrived in Xingnan Town near Baxian and Shengfang, thirty li away.</p>
<h3>First Trial of Traitors in Beiping and Tianjin to be Handled by Hebei High Court; Many Traitors Arrested in Tianjin Were Henchmen of the Enemy Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Responsible persons from relevant parties said that the work of arresting traitors in Beiping and Tianjin began on the 6th and was mostly completed by the 8th. The steps for handling traitors have been determined: first, the responsible agency will investigate and interrogate them, and then transfer them to the court for legal action. The first trial of traitors in Beiping will be handled by the pseudo-Hebei High Court. The High Court prosecutor will first investigate and file a public prosecution, and then transfer the case to the criminal court for trial. In addition to the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law, the laws cited for prosecuting traitors include the "Regulations on Traitors' Surrender," the "Regulations on Punishing Traitors," and the "Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases." The provisions of the "Regulations on Traitors' Surrender" apply to those who surrender before August 10th, which has now expired. Those who surrender now cannot be handled according to these regulations. Traitors who surrender in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places are all called "自投" (self-surrender). If a traitor whose name is not included in the list of traitors surrenders himself, the sentence may be reduced depending on the circumstances. The first provision in yesterday's proclamation by the Northeast Headquarters, "Traitors who should be arrested according to the Regulations on Punishing Traitors are encouraged to arouse their conscience, obey the national law, and surrender as soon as possible," is intended to encourage traitors who have not yet been arrested to surrender themselves as soon as possible so that they may receive leniency and a reduced sentence depending on the circumstances. When asked how many traitors have been arrested so far and whether the entire list can be published, it was said that the exact number is not yet known, but it is probably between 200 and 300. It can only be published after investigation and interrogation. It was also learned from the Hebei High Court that it has not yet received any cases of traitors transferred from various parties or cases of traitors who surrendered themselves. The traitors who have already been arrested, in addition to Wang Yintai, Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, Wen Yuanzhang, Wang Shijing, Xu Xiuzhi, Liu Yushu, Zhou Dawen, and Guan Yixian, also include Yu Jinhe (pseudo-Mayor of Beijing, Director-General of the North China Cooperative Enterprise Association, Construction Director-General), Tao Shangming, Yin Rugeng (former member of the pseudo-Economic Committee), Pan Yugui (pseudo-Mayor of Tianjin), Du Xijun (pseudo-Superintendent of the Public Security Headquarters), Zhang Yanqing (pseudo-Vice President of the Xinmin Society), Leng Jiaji (pseudo-Chairman of the North China Communist Suppression Committee, member of the North China Political Affairs Committee), Cao Rulin (Chairman of several enemy-puppet economic, financial, and industrial institutions), Huang Nanpeng (pseudo-North China Gendarmerie Commander, Principal of the Gendarmerie School), Zhang Bi (head of the pseudo-Anqing Gang, who led plainclothes bandits to attack Zhang Zizhong's security team in Tianjin after the July 7th Incident), Rong Zhen (pseudo-Governor of Hebei Province), Zheng Xianzhen (pseudo-Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Government), Tang Yangdu (pseudo-Governor of Shandong Province, Director-General of the Public Works Administration), Hao Peng (pseudo-Administrative Commissioner of the Suhuai Special Zone), Wu Qiuchen (pseudo-Minister of Organization of the Xinmin Society), Qian Zongchao (pseudo-Director of the Police Administration Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Committee), Zhang Erkang (pseudo-President of the Normal University), Hong Weiguo, Yu Xijie (pseudo-Vice President of the Xinmin Society), Zou Quansun (pseudo-Member of the North China Political Affairs Committee, President of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, Vice Chairman of the Enemy North China Trade Distribution Control Association), Chen Cengshi (pseudo-Director-General of the Ministry of Industry), Zhang Zhongzhi (pseudo-Deputy Director of the General Affairs Office of the North China Political Council), Zhou Zuoren (pseudo-Director-General of the North China Education Administration), Shu Zhuanghuai (pseudo-Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Works Bureau), Wu Zhen (pseudo-Director-General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs), Chi Zongmo (pseudo-Chairman of the Labor Association, a pseudo-organization that forced laborers on behalf of the Japanese), Liu Zongji (pseudo-Director of the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau), Liu Zongyi (pseudo-Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Government), Cheng Xixian (pseudo-Director-General of the Anti-Smoking Bureau), You Bolu, Cui Jianchu (pseudo-Director of the Beijing Municipal Police Bureau), and others.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Traitors arrested in Tianjin are being detained in three locations. All those on the list handed down by the Central Government who are in Tianjin have been arrested. However, those who are reported by the people and found to have solid evidence will still be arrested. When the authorities arrested the traitors, they sealed up their property and set up an agency to be responsible for clearing it. Anyone who conceals the property of traitors will be punished the same as traitors. Among the traitors who have been arrested in Tianjin, in addition to the leaders of the pseudo-organizations, there are many henchmen of the enemy army. The list includes Qi Xieyuan, Qin Hua, and several others.</p>
<h3>Kunming Students Prepare to Resume Classes</h3>
<p>Respect the Wishes of the Head of State</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 9th] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the Kunming student unrest and has specially dispatched Vice Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong and Supervisor Huo Kuizhang to Kunming to investigate the facts. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, Chairman Lu, accompanied by Zhu and Huo, took慰问品 (comfort items) to the affiliated hospital of Yunnan University and Ganmei Hospital to慰问 (express sympathy to) the injured students.

<h3>Key to World Peace: Huddle States Strengthening Sino-American Relations; U.S. Government Has Not Yet Instructed Marshall</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 8th] Senator Huddle declared today at the Republican Executive Committee: World peace depends on the United States strengthening its relations with China. China is currently friendly to the United States, and this kind of relationship should be maintained. A slight mistake will inevitably seriously damage Sino-American relations. [Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, Associated Press] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes declared at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: The U.S. government has not yet given Marshall any instructions regarding China policy. The postponement of Marshall's meeting with Byrnes is due to Marshall's attendance at the Pearl Harbor Investigation Committee to testify. Byrnes said that after the testimony is completed, the two will hold a meeting and send the memorandum of the meeting to Marshall.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall declared today at the Committee Investigating the Pearl Harbor Massacre that if the United States had 100 four-engine bombers in the Philippines, Japan would not dare to act toward the South China Sea, let alone covet the Philippines.

<p>[Our Newspaper Sound Recording] Washington, 9th dispatch, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson will attend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting tomorrow to respond to Hurley's remarks. It is reported that Hurley once accused Acheson of being a diplomat who undermined U.S. foreign policy. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally announced that Hurley's accusations have already collapsed of their own weight.

However, Acheson should have the opportunity to defend himself.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 7th, United Press dispatch] Byrnes, when attending a Senate Foreign Relations Committee report, did not mention Iran.

Hurley also attended the Foreign Relations Committee meeting, stating, "Byrnes is evading the main issue. He did not answer the question I raised, namely, that Acheson had suggested lending materials to the Chinese Communist Party." Hurley also stated that his own memory of his meeting with Byrnes did not match the Secretary of State's memory. He had asked Byrnes to release the documents discussed, but Byrnes refused. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally asked Byrnes whether he would approve the release of Acheson's memorandum. Byrnes replied that he was willing to submit everything to the Foreign Relations Committee but was unwilling to make it public. Connally then ended the meeting, stating that the Foreign Relations Committee would hold a closed meeting on the 8th to discuss the documents submitted by the State Department.</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper London Correspondence – Notes on the UNESCO Conference (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers' meeting in London ended unhappily, and the future of peace is not entirely smooth. However, these numerous thorns cannot discourage those with foresight who seek human happiness. It takes a hundred years to cultivate people. International understanding should start with cultural exchange, and the foundation of peace should be in education.</p>
<p>Embracing this shared ideal, prominent figures in education and culture from thirty-nine countries traveled great distances to London, preparing to contribute their wisdom and sow the seeds of lasting peace.</p>
<p>The American delegation was a large contingent of thirty-two people, including representatives, consultants, technical secretaries, secretaries, assistant secretaries, and those in charge of administrative matters. The French delegation, although smaller than the American delegation, was led by the leader of the Socialist Party, Léon Blum himself. He had been imprisoned by the Germans for a full five years and was making his first appearance at an international conference since his release. It is said that the radical party leader Édouard Herriot was originally supposed to be the chief representative, but when the radical party's seats in parliament plummeted to nineteen in the general election, he did not attend. Both England and France are inviting countries, so Blum is an Associate President.</p>
<p>The president of the conference is the British Minister of Education, Miss Wilkinson, a pillar of the British Labor Party, as famous as Professor Laski. On the eve of the meeting, her name appeared in the headlines of British newspapers, not because she was going to chair the meeting, but because she gave a speech in her hometown, claiming that if the dockworkers' strike did not stop this winter, there might be a dangerous rationing of bread. This speech caused a stir in London and was discussed in Parliament. Members of Parliament expressed great dissatisfaction with Miss Wilkinson's alarmist remarks. Miss Wilkinson bravely admitted her mistake, saying that she was not the Minister of Food, but just making a casual prediction and would be more careful in her future statements. After pleading not guilty in Parliament, she came to the UNESCO conference to serve as president.</p>
<p>Guatemala, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia all had their Ministers of Education as their chief representatives. News came from home that Minister Zhu was supposed to attend in person. Upon hearing this, Oxford University prepared to award Minister Zhu an honorary doctorate, an honor given only twice a year. However, Minister Zhu set off from Chongqing, arriving in Nanjing instead of London. The honorary doctorate from Oxford University must be accepted in person. Since the recipient was not present, Oxford University had to regretfully withdraw the prepared honor.</p>
<p>Acting Chief Representative Dr. Hu Shih had already gained international fame. His speech made everyone feel that his reputation was well-deserved, and everyone praised him. On the day he spoke, a female representative from India also gave a speech, which also won applause from the whole audience. Everyone agreed that it was Asia's most glorious day.</p>
<p>The original intention of the conference's discussion was to use the draft of the Ministers of Education conference held in London as the basis. Later, because France also put forward a draft and other countries also had opinions, they were discussed together.</p>
<p>When the League of Nations was first established, the League of Nations' Committee on Intellectual Cooperation organized an International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, located in Paris. The French representatives originally advocated using this institute as the secretariat for the future international education and cultural organization, with the director of the institute as the secretary-general, meaning to preserve this organization. The representatives of the participating countries were largely not in favor of this. Blum, aware of this, did not mention this point during his opening speech, only hoping that the future international education and cultural organization could be located in Paris. The British side had probably already agreed to this proposal, and the United States had no objection. It looks like the proposal to locate the headquarters in Paris can be expected to pass.</p>
<p>It is said that there were some disputes between the United States and France during the preparatory meeting before the cultural education conference, but the atmosphere was unusually harmonious during the conference, perhaps due to the evolution of the international situation. The Soviet Union did not participate or send anyone to attend, which was disappointing to everyone. In informal conversations at the venue, everyone expressed great regret about this.</p>
<p>Regarding the name of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United States proposed adding the word "Science," and the Chinese representative strongly seconded the proposal. The subcommittee has already passed it, and with the atomic bomb attracting attention, scientific cooperation should indeed be emphasized.</p>
<p>The conference venue was the Institution of Civil Engineers in Britain, an empty hall with rows of benches, without any brilliant decorations for this conference, and no slogans such as "Cultural Cooperation." There were only a few boards on all sides, with the words "No Smoking." In front of the benches, there were small signs with the names of the countries arranged in ABCD order, specially set up for the conference. Only these small wooden boards. The Chinese representatives sat in the first row, next to the Chilean representative, who was only one person.</p>
<p>The official documents of the conference were in English, French, Chinese, and Russian. During the meeting, English and French were given equal importance. Anything spoken in English or French was not translated. If a language other than English or French was spoken, it was translated into English and then into French. Next to the chairman, one translator translated into English, and the other translated into French. Reports at the conference were given in both English and French.</p>
<p>The conference secretariat took care of everything. When the representatives came to the meeting, they had problems with food and clothing. Regarding food, the secretariat had already obtained a food rationing book for each of them, which could be used for three weeks. Regarding clothing, they had not yet received the "points" required to buy clothes. There was a shortage of labor in London, and laundromats took two weeks to return clothes. Representatives who brought few shirts were already experiencing a shirt shortage. The problem of world education and cultural cooperation was giving them headaches, but what was currently giving them even more headaches was the shirt problem. (London, November 9th)</p>

<h3>The Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference – A Prelude to Further Cooperation – Seeking Practical Solutions to Major Current Issues – London Says A Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Will Follow</h3>
<p>[United Press London 8th dispatch] The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, to be held in Moscow next Saturday, is generally believed here to have been convened at the request of British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Bevin once described the meeting as a conference to declare the highest demands of each country, in which each country is bound to lay its cards on the table. With the support of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, Bevin will demand that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov declare the Soviet Union's goals in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Iran, and the Pacific. In return for the Soviet Union's frank declaration of its goals, the secrets of the atomic bomb will be made public. Prior to the Washington conference between U.S. President Truman and British Prime Minister Attlee, British spokesmen had stated that unless the Soviet authorities declared their foreign intentions, the secrets of the atomic bomb would not be disclosed to the Soviet Union. This truly subtle atomic matter will become the centerpiece of the "international poker game" of Bevin, Byrnes, and Molotov, reuniting after the breakdown of the London conference. It is reported that Byrnes is accompanied by several atomic experts on this trip to Moscow, including Brigadier General Leslie Groves, who is in charge of atomic bomb improvements, and Dr. Vannevar Bush, a famous American atomic expert. During this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov will make persistent inquiries, as the Soviet Union has long expressed dissatisfaction with the control of the Pacific. Therefore, there should be sufficient claims in the case of joint control of Japan.</p>
<p>It is predicted that after the conclusion of the Moscow conference, a Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held in succession. This Foreign Ministers' Conference will include Dr. Wang Shijie of China and Mr. Bidault of France. British officials have not been able to confirm whether a Five-Power Conference will be held, but they firmly stated that the White House has a strong desire to convene a meeting of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers soon.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 9th dispatch] Our correspondent in Moscow reported that the news that the Three-Power Foreign Ministers will hold a meeting in Moscow is welcomed here as concrete evidence of Three-Power cooperation. The discussion of the atomic issue is particularly gratifying. It is generally expected that after continued frank discussions, satisfactory results can be obtained on several major issues. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes informed the Chinese and French ambassadors to the United States that the Three-Power Conference will not reduce the authority of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The convening of this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is based on the decision of the Yalta Conference, as a partial resolution among the Three Powers.</p>
<p>Wide Range of Discussion</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 9th dispatch] This Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be a preliminary step in dispelling mutual suspicion among the major Allied countries. It is reported that in addition to the atomic bomb and control of Japan, the following issues will also be discussed at the upcoming Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference: (1) The issue of unified control of Germany. (2) A plan for a peace conference to finally resolve territorial disputes and war reparations. (3) The resolution of political issues. (4) The issue of Soviet ships freely passing through the Dardanelles Strait. (5) The issue of the withdrawal of troops from Iran by the three countries. (6) The Soviet Union's participation in the Control Council for Japan. (7) Resolving the situation in Korea. It is expected that the above issues will be consulted and coordinated in all aspects. General observation suggests that the conference may reach a final agreement, as it was initially initiated by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, and the Soviet Union immediately expressed its approval, which is powerful proof.</p>
<p>France Declares its Position</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 9th dispatch] General de Gaulle's office issued a statement yesterday stating that if the upcoming Moscow conference only discusses the atomic bomb issue and does not involve France, France does not intend to protest, even though it has not been invited to participate. However, if issues of interest to France are discussed without seeking French opinion, France will not be bound by the agreement of the conference and will protest.</p>

<h3>Hess's Riddle of Fleeing to England Broken</h3>
<p>[United Press Nuremberg 8th dispatch] Hess today answered various English questions from a United Press reporter in writing in Nuremberg Prison. It is said that his flight to England was not, as most people imagine, to seek British help in attacking the Soviet Union, but only to prevent the battle between the two great glorious nations. Before Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, he had set out to England several times, but each time he turned back due to bad weather. Before the trip, he had left a letter to Hitler, saying that he had decided to go his own way, even if he was called crazy by the Führer.</p>
<h3>Massively Raising Economic Standards – The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is Being Drafted – Expanding the Transportation Network and Developing Heavy Industry – Agricultural Mechanization and Rural Electrification</h3>

<h3>Boy Scout Affairs in the National Recovered Areas Divided into Nine Districts for Supervision</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing News] The General Association of Boy Scouts of China has recently formulated a plan for supervising Boy Scout affairs in the national recovered areas, dividing them into nine districts for implementation:</p>
<p>Districts: (1) Jiangsu-Zhejiang District (including Nanjing and Shanghai), (2) Hebei-Shandong District (including Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping), (3) Henan-Shanxi District, (4) Hubei-Hunan District, (5) Anhui-Jiangxi District, (6) Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian District, (7) Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan District, (8) Northeast District (including Dalian and Harbin), (9) Taiwan District.</p>
<p>Tasks: Each district will be assigned a senior cadre by the General Association to be responsible for supervisory work.

<h3>Wartime Atrocities of Japanese in Tianjin – Destroying Chinese Education</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Tianjin News] During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese in Tianjin implemented an educational policy of "the less reading the better" to destroy the knowledge of Chinese youth. According to Huo Minghe, the principal of the private Beixian Elementary School, and Liu Baizhang, the principal of the attached elementary school of the municipal teachers' college, students did not attend class regularly. They were only used to deliver goods for the Japanese army or sweep snow off the roads. If they had free time, they would participate in parades or Japanese memorial services. Middle school students, in addition to participating in the same activities, were also forced to work in factories or Japanese air bases. As for the private Yaohua Middle School, which was in the former British Concession, it had more than a thousand students before the war. After the Japanese occupied Tianjin, public and private schools could not withstand the pressure, and students transferred to the Chinese interior. The principal of the school, Zhao Tianlin, was able to encourage students with a patriotic consciousness, and therefore incurred the resentment of the Japanese army, who martyred him at the school gate on June 20, 1938. It can be seen that the Japanese educational policy was to eliminate all patriotic educators in China.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Problems Caused by the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office</h3>
<p>In recent days, it has been heard that Shanghai's industrial and commercial firms have raised many concerns due to the municipal government's mandatory industrial and commercial registration, and accountants are also making appeals. In fact, factory registration should have been carried out in accordance with the Factory Law, and the central competent department in charge of industry and commerce can entrust local governments to carry it out. As for commercial registration, the central government also has regulations, and the city had conducted it in accordance with the law before the war. This re-implementation is commonplace among merchants. As long as the methods are reasonable and the procedures are simple, it may not be considered too difficult. What needs special attention is the following issues in terms of time, procedures, and expenses.</p>
<p>(1) Time Issue: The Bureau of Social Affairs announced at the end of last month, designating areas and setting a deadline of the 5th of this month to collect forms and the 10th of this month to fill them out according to the prescribed format, with each stage set for five days. The business community may find this too hasty. Because the object of commercial registration is sole proprietorships and partnerships, and companies are not included, with small-scale businesses and handicraft workshops being the majority. They have few personnel, relatively shallow knowledge, and often do not read newspapers regularly. Assuming that their manager is away due to an accident, how should they fill out the forms? Their partners or family members may find it difficult to cope. Therefore, there is a legitimate reason to advocate for an appropriate extension to reduce difficulties. If commercial registration is still of a voluntary nature in accordance with central laws and regulations, then the deadline may not be a major obstacle, because registration or not is at their own discretion. Otherwise, if it becomes mandatory, and businesses must stop operating if they do not register, then the deadline should be extended even further. However, why the authorities have set such a short deadline has not yet been explained. It is speculated that since it is being held in stages and districts, given the size of Shanghai and the prosperity of its commerce, if each stage is delayed too much, it may affect the completion of the entire work. Although this is a speculation, it does not seem far from the truth. However, in order to fully understand the commercial situation, we still hope that an appropriate extension can be granted.</p>
<p>(2) Problem of Agency by Trade Associations: Because the deadline is too short, people collecting forms have experienced the pain of queuing and waiting. Therefore, some trade associations have volunteered. They plan to advance funds from the trade association, collect the forms in batches, and then distribute them to their peers to fill them out separately. This is naturally a good intention and cooperation. If the purpose of this industrial and commercial registration is not for the protection of rights, but rather for the authorities to obtain investigation and statistical materials, then the method of agency by trade associations can be accepted. Because doing so can reduce the trouble for businesses, reduce the procedures for government offices, and increase the connection and trust of the industry in the trade association, and there is no violation of laws and regulations. What a good thing that achieves several benefits, so why not do it?</p>
<p>(3) Problem of Consolidated Filling Out: Furthermore, having the trade associations consolidate and submit the forms on behalf of businesses should be no problem for the registrants, and the Bureau of Social Affairs may also be willing to accept it. Because individual receipt and consolidated receipt should not make much of a difference in terms of procedures.</p>
<p>(4) Payment Problem: The registration fees paid for industrial and commercial registration must be paid into the municipal treasury in accordance with the law, and unified collection and disbursement must be implemented. The Bureau cannot collect and remit the fees on behalf of the treasury. It is said that the responsible authorities have made the greatest efforts to address this issue. Initially, they hoped to achieve collection and remittance on behalf of the treasury to avoid the pain of merchants traveling back and forth, but this was not possible due to regulations. Unable to do so, they considered the next best thing, which was to request the municipal treasury to send personnel to the Bureau to collect the fees nearby. This can be considered benevolent and exhaustive. This method does not violate the principle of unified collection and disbursement, and it can save merchants many detours and troubles. Perhaps this is always possible in reality. Then, the matter of consolidated submission and payment also seems to be something that can be considered incidentally.</p>
<p>(5) Fee Problem: This problem is quite serious. The current method is indeed much higher than the old regulations and is a progressive system. So there are various discussions and appeals from the business community, hoping that the authorities will consider reducing the fees to alleviate the distress of businesses. Speaking from a business perspective, this is a reasonable and justifiable move. In all fairness, prices are now high and currency values are low, so it would be inappropriate to measure them using the old regulations. Moreover, the company registration regulations also adopt a progressive system for registration fees, and the authorities' current regulations are not without basis. However, since the war, the country has been scarred and business is declining. The purpose of registration is not to generate income, so if the authorities can be considerate and reduce the fees appropriately, it would not be a bad policy.</p>
<p>(6) Problem of Filling Out the Amount of Capital: This newspaper has already published a special article on this issue. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has not received instructions from the Ministry and the registration of industrial and commercial businesses here is subject to a deadline, they were forced to convene standing committee members from various industries and decided on a hypothetical method. In terms of weighing the situation and considering the principles, it can be said that they have put in a lot of effort. However, cautious people still have two concerns. First, providing false information is subject to punishment according to regulations. Second, the amount of capital is related to taxation, and too much or too little will cause obstacles. Therefore, some people are still observing. In this special time, solving this special dispute is really not a perfect solution. We can only hope that the competent authorities in charge of industry and commerce and the tax authorities will consider both the law and the sentiment, maintain a broad approach, and not be too strict.</p>
<p>In summary, since the victory, the Central Government has repeatedly announced to the people that it will rest and recuperate, share weal and woe with the people, and especially instructed the recovered areas to "recover the hearts of the people." This is nothing more than to give the people who have survived the disaster an opportunity to recover. Therefore, when conducting industrial and commercial registration, we hope that the government can take into account the difficulties of businesses and grant the greatest tolerance in all aspects, whether it is the time, the procedures, or the fees, that can facilitate the business community and reduce the suffering of business people. This is true in Shanghai, and it is also true in the interior. At the same time, we also hope that business people will strictly abide by the laws and regulations, fill out the forms truthfully, and not hesitate or wait, delaying this work that the people and the government should cooperate on.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Transportation on Various Routes in Central China: New American Locomotives Arrive in Shanghai: A Total of Twenty Shipped from the Persian Gulf: To Be Unloaded at Shanghai Docks Within a Month</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Twenty of the latest American train locomotives have been shipped to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and will arrive in Shanghai soon. After these locomotives arrive in Shanghai, they will be allocated to the Central China Railway to strengthen transportation capacity.</p>
<p>Chen Bozhuang Talks</p>
<p>According to Chen Bozhuang, the person in charge of the Central China Railway Administration Committee, speaking to a reporter from this newspaper: The current difficulty in railway transportation lies in the insufficient allocation of locomotives. During the Japanese occupation, most of the locomotives were damaged due to overuse and poor maintenance. Of the locomotives received by the committee, nineteen need to be repaired, but due to the current shortage of materials, the repair work cannot be promoted. As a result, the actual allocation of usable locomotives is extremely difficult. Therefore, railway transport in central China today has fallen into a situation where there are cars without locomotives, and locomotives without coal. The locomotives recently shipped from the United States will be allocated to various railways to remedy the current urgent need.</p>
<p>Equipped with Cranes</p>
<p>According to the American Navy's "Abaton" ship, which is equipped with the largest ship-borne crane in the U.S. Navy, it will begin unloading twenty locomotives shipped from the U.S. at the local docks within a month. These locomotives are currently being loaded onto freighters from the Persian Gulf to Shanghai, each weighing ninety tons. The lifting capacity of the "Abaton" crane is 160 tons, so there should be no problem. The work is being undertaken by the Ministry of Transportation's Central China Railway Administration Committee, which will send two engineers to assist in handling the unloading.</p>
<h3>First American Liberty Ship Expected to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency] According to Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the six American Liberty Ships that are about to arrive in Shanghai will sail directly here from Manila. According to telegrams, the departure date indicates that the first ship may arrive in Shanghai today. The reception ceremony will be held after all six ships have arrived.</p>
<h3>Shanghai, Chongqing, and Kunming Newspaper Reporters Hold Air Conversation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Amateur Wireless Association held an air conversation meeting for newspaper reporters from Shanghai, Chongqing, and Kunming yesterday afternoon, inviting more than 30 reporters from various newspapers. Zhu Qiqing, President of the General Association, and Jiang Shudong and Zhu Songling, Directors of the Shanghai Branch, hosted the meeting. Starting at 3:00 PM, the reporters spoke with their colleagues in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places more than twenty times. The conversations were completed at 5:00 PM, and the voices were very clear. A reporter from Kunming told the Central News Agency reporter here that "the student unrest in Kunming has been resolved since Zhu Jingnong arrived in Kunming to handle it."</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspapers Report Japanese Underground Activities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Office] According to a report yesterday from Lieberman, the New York Times correspondent in Shanghai: "Japanese underground activities in Shanghai are becoming busy due to lax supervision. Former Japanese secret agents and propagandists are currently residing in Hongkou as Japanese residents, gaining many opportunities to communicate with the Japanese prisoner of war camps under their own management. Although the Chinese authorities have stipulated measures for managing Japanese prisoners and residents, there is a lack of supervision at this time when the Japanese are waiting to be evacuated. In fact, the only liaison between Japanese prisoners and the outside world is mostly 50 liaisons who were formerly Japanese officers. They are all wearing civilian clothes and living outside the concentration camp. The 100,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou are currently managed by their own national organization. The Japanese prisoner of war camp here is not similar to any other institution of the same nature. I asked a Chinese military commander where the Chinese supervision was, and he replied, 'We have no guards. The act of guarding is not safe. There are too many Japanese.' Lieberman quoted General Tang Enbo as saying that apart from the remaining 5,000 Japanese soldiers in Shanghai who have not surrendered their weapons, the rest have surrendered. There are 900,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai and Nanjing, and only 2,000 have returned home. None of the imprisoned Japanese soldiers have been evacuated to Japan. Japanese residents wear white armbands, but it is easy to obtain permits to leave the concentrated area. Japanese residents are concentrated in family units and are managed by the former Japanese Consul-General. This includes three types: military, democrats, and a few communists, and conspiracies to compete for power are often heard. Among them, those who are large in the military faction oppose the propaganda of democracy."</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer Returns to Shanghai After Meeting MacArthur in Tokyo: General Barbey Also Returns to Duty Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Disposition of War Criminal Tani Masayuki Still Awaits Decision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Since Tani Masayuki, the former Japanese ambassador to the puppet government, surrendered himself to the Japanese Residents Administration and was detained, reporters have learned that the Japanese Residents Administration is now awaiting instructions from the headquarters of the Chinese Army regarding the disposition of Tani Masayuki. Since Tani Masayuki's name was included in MacArthur's list of war criminals, the method of disposition is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Pro-Enemy Filipino Traitors, Including Youai, Arrested</h3>

Youai served as the chairman of the Japanese-controlled "Shanghai Filipino Association," relying on the power of the Japanese to promote the "pro-Japanese and anti-American" movement among Filipinos. He also went to Japan to participate in the "Greater East Asia Liberation Assembly" in the capacity of a representative of the Filipinos in Shanghai. At one point, Youai presided over the *Shanghai Times* under Japanese guidance.</p>
<h3>Authorities Regret the Case of Military Police Shooting and Killing a U.S. Soldier</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] At around 3:00 AM on the 6th, Xu Alin, of 83 Pingliang Road, Pudong, was suddenly awakened by two drunken U.S. sailors knocking on his door, which led to a case of military police mistakenly killing a U.S. soldier. Reporters visited the independent 3rd Battalion of the Military Police yesterday and met with Deputy Battalion Commander Zhao, who reported that the circumstances had been reported to the 3rd Army and the headquarters of the Military Police, and the U.S. Naval Headquarters in Shanghai had been notified. When reporters asked about the age and origin of the guard who fired the shot, he replied: His name is Luo Jixiong, he is 22 years old, from Sichuan, and he is a young soldier. He enlisted in the Chengdu Training Corps. When the shot was fired, it was difficult to distinguish the nationality of foreigners in the dark. He first fired three warning shots, but the other party ignored them, so he had to use weapons. Afterwards, it was learned that the Allied forces had suffered this unfortunate incident, which was deeply regretted. As for the victims, Xu Alin and his wife, both suffered injuries to their left eyes and were sent to the police hospital for treatment. Two medical records have been sent to the U.S. Naval Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Establishes an Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that Shanghai is the center of gravity of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's business, and that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's (UNRRA) materials transported to China are mostly unloaded and distributed in Shanghai, the Administration has decided to establish an office in Shanghai to coordinate all of the Administration's national business. The office has now been formally established and is headed by Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Administration, who is stationed in Shanghai. Deputy Director Li arrived in Shanghai on the 6th and began organizing the office. It is heard that most of the Administration's Storage and Transportation Department, Finance Department, Distribution Department, and Investigation and Translation Department will work in the Shanghai office. The heads of the departments have also come with Deputy Director Li, and the work is actively underway.</p>
<p>Also, Keyes, the director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's China Branch, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th with 25 staff members from the Administration's Chongqing headquarters. He told reporters that Shanghai will be the central location for the UNRRA, and an office must also be set up in the capital for liaison purposes.

<h3>Zhengzhong Bookstore Fire Destroys 30,000 Books</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] A fire broke out at 9:30 PM on the 8th at the Shanghai branch bookstore warehouse of Zhengzhong Bookstore, located at 167 Tiantong Road in this city. Firefighters extinguished the blaze. The location is a four-bay front and back building. During the war, it was the general office of the enemy Shanghai Bookstore Co., Ltd. After the victory of the war, when Zhengzhong Bookstore was ordered to take over its use on October 30th, the Hongkou Police Precinct dispatched police to accompany them. At that time, the police precinct had already determined that the contract had been broken. In addition to requesting the police precinct to investigate, the bookstore had separately reported to Special Commissioner Zhan of the Central Propaganda Department and the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for record. Subsequently, the location was used as a dormitory for Shanghai branch employees and a temporary bookstore warehouse. At 9:30 PM on the 8th, when a fire broke out in the middle of the rear building, the city fire brigade rushed to put it out. The fire was quickly extinguished, lasting a short time. Three rooms were burned, including four beds, and approximately 30,000 books of medium-level educational textbooks and reference books (estimated at approximately 3.5 million yuan based on wholesale prices), approximately 40 old textbook paper molds from before the war, and some daily necessities. The headquarters' book warehouse and paper warehouse are not located here, so the losses are relatively light. According to the fire brigade and police personnel who arrived on the scene the night before last, the ceiling and walls of the rear building were decorated with cardboard by the Japanese residents, which is extremely flammable, and the wiring was too old, so the possibility of an electrical fire is very high. After the incident, the bookstore has separately requested that the police precinct and the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau send personnel to the scene to investigate the area.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Philippe Baudet Visits Diao Zuoqian</h3>

<h3>Zhongzheng Road to be Developed into a Tree-Lined Avenue, Planting Plane Trees on Both Sides</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau has decided to develop Zhongzheng Road into a tree-lined avenue, and plans to start a trial run on the section from the Bund to Xizang Road. Yesterday, the bureau began transplanting trees between the fast and slow lanes to divide them and enhance the appearance. Prior to this, workers were instructed to dig pits and excavate mud along the line, because Zhongzheng East Road (formerly Edward Road) was formed by filling in a creek with garbage, resulting in poor soil quality, which made it difficult for trees to grow. In recent years, many have died, and very few trees remain. This time, the holes will be filled with four feet of yellow mud to facilitate the growth of the trees. It is also planned to plant French plane trees on the sidewalks on both sides of Zhongzheng East Road, and construction will begin soon.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Expedite the Raising of Relief Funds</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>The main goal of running social service programs is, of course, to seek the welfare of the people. However, this task is vast in scope, and at the same time requires too many conditions. Given that the current political situation is not on track, it is conceivable that it will be difficult to achieve effective results. Therefore, as a last resort, starting with relief efforts should be a transitional approach. In fact, after eight years of war, the extent of suffering among the people has deepened even more than before, making relief extremely urgent. How can the vast unemployed masses be enabled to find work? How can the poor and sick receive medical treatment and medication? How can orphans without fathers or mothers receive education and care? How can the old and weak without support spend their remaining years? How can the disabled be accommodated? In addition, with the severe winter approaching, how can the distribution of clothing and porridge be implemented? These all fall within the scope of relief and should be handled promptly. We believe that although many of the tragic scenes in the world are due to "self-inflicted sins," the impact of the war is ultimately the main reason, and its severity is very widespread. Therefore, we estimate that the current relief work will require a very large amount of manpower and resources, which cannot be accomplished solely by the city's original charitable organizations. Rather, it must be actively promoted by influential people in society in order to achieve widespread results. At the same time, we believe that those people in Shanghai who have never suffered during the War of Resistance should think about how "lucky they are to have survived the hardships"! Then, what is it to contribute a little effort or donate a little money to the current relief efforts? In particular, those who stirred up trouble and made a fortune from the national crisis during the national crisis should now reflect on how they have violated their conscience too much and have let down the country and the people too much. Therefore, making the greatest effort for the relief efforts is the best opportunity to "atone for their sins." Only when the tragic scenes in society no longer exist can the people truly have welfare.</p>

<h3>Lu Xiaoman Who Lost Xu Zhimo</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Every time I talk to friends about the issue of new poetry, we all invariably deeply regret the early death of the poet Xu Zhimo! Everyone knows that he was a giant star in the early stages of Chinese new poetry. His creations made the Chinese poetry scene radiate brilliant light, but his fall also caused the Chinese poetry scene to fade from that point on!</p>
<p>Out of grief for Mr. Zhimo, I cannot help but be concerned about Ms. Lu Xiaoman who lost Zhimo! Since Zhimo's passing, Ms. Xiaoman has never again written for the world. From this, one can imagine her general state of mind! Therefore, in Chongqing, I decided that I must visit her in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I wrote her a letter half a month ago, saying that I would go see her, and her reply also warmly hoped that I would go quickly. However, because I have not had time and have been in a restless mood, it has been impossible to talk about visiting her.</p>
<p>Today is the best day. Although it is cold, the sun came out in the afternoon. The cold cleared my busy mind, and the sun aroused my interest in going out for a walk. So I put down my pen and decided to visit Ms. Lu Xiaoman, who may have already been forgotten by people.</p>
<p>Fuxu Road is especially desolate, with sparse traffic and few pedestrians. Only fallen leaves are scattered on the sidewalk, lonely and silent, almost soul-shattering. I couldn't help but quietly say: This is precisely the environment where a poet should live.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the Lu residence, I knocked on the ring for a long time before a maid with a northern accent came out. I gave her my name card, explaining that I had come specially to visit Ms. Lu. She then led me into the first and second floor living room. The living room is quite large, with old-fashioned furnishings and a strong scholarly atmosphere. On a rectangular painting table, brushes, ink, and pigments were scattered in a disorganized manner. A landscape painting that had just been continued was spread out on the table. Later, I learned that this was Xiaoman's only pastime in Shanghai, day after day, year after year. The table was inlaid with a glass plate, under which was pressed a casual photograph of Mr. Zhimo. He was lying on a lawn, holding a cigarette in his hand, elegant and otherworldly, with a lifelike expression. We can imagine that even when Ms. Xiaoman is painting, she still needs Mr. Zhimo's portrait to accompany her and comfort her.</p>
<p>The four walls are full of paintings and calligraphy. A large portrait of Ms. Xiaoman in her youth hung on the left corner of the photograph. Directly opposite her on the center of the left wall hung a large portrait of a man. One can tell at a glance that this is our poet Xu Zhimo. With the person gone but the shadow remaining, it is impossible not to be filled with grief and respect!</p>
<p>After about the time it takes to smoke a cigarette, there were footsteps from upstairs, followed by Ms. Lu Xiaoman walking into the living room with a smile.</p>
<p>Although she was wearing a very thick black sheepskin robe, it still couldn't hide her frail figure. Her complexion was pale, and it was undeniable that she was suffering from anemia. She was not wearing any makeup, which shows her state of mind, but she was still beautiful, like a secluded orchid, quietly and transcendently hidden in a deep valley.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting for you for so long and you haven't come. I thought my letter hadn't been delivered," she said warmly, holding my hand.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, I was busy and dragged it out until now to see you," I really felt apologetic at this moment. I regretted not coming sooner.</p>
<p>"Have you been feeling better lately?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no! I'm sick almost all year round. I couldn't even get out of bed a few days ago, otherwise I would have come to see you sooner!"</p>
<p>After she said this, she sat down beside me. At this moment, I noticed that she had a pair of eyes full of melancholy. She seemed afraid to see the light, and she often avoided places where the sun reflected.</p>
<p>"I haven't stepped out of the door for many years, and it can also be said that I haven't seen the sun for many years."</p>
<p>She understood that I was paying attention to her overly sad expression, so she quickly explained herself: She felt that human feelings and the world had become too ruthless in recent years. The sun was originally supposed to shine as a mirror of kindness and sincerity. Since it has lost this function, then its radiance is crippled. Therefore, she would rather let darkness and cold surround her, so that she gradually becomes numb through habit. Apart from her small building, which is her world, everything outside the small building is irrelevant to her, and she doesn't bother to ask about it.</p>
<p>But Ms. Lu cares about some of her old friends who are still in the mainland. She said:</p>
<p>"There are simply no friends in Shanghai, so I spend every day in absolute loneliness. I sleep in the morning, get up in the afternoon to read and paint, and at night I stay up all night with a lonely lamp, smoking, and spraying medicine; letting the smoke blur my entire mind."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, she suddenly asked about Mr. Wang Yunwu. She told me:</p>
<p>"I have no hope for anything. I only want to see the publication of the 'Complete Works of Zhimo' as soon as possible. This is the only thing I haven't been able to forget all these years. This is the only work I have done since Zhimo's death, but this matter is like a stone sinking into the sea. The book has not been published, and there is no news at all. Speaking of this, I will tell you a strange dream."</p>
<p>She began to excitedly narrate a pile of bitterness that had been lurking deep in her heart.</p>
<p>"When I started editing the 'Complete Works of Zhimo,' one night, I dreamed of Zhimo, clearly and distinctly. He was still as unrestrained and clever as when he was alive. I seemed to be looking at his manuscripts at the desk. He walked over from behind me, patted me and said, 'I am really grateful to you. You are working so hard to compile the complete works for me, but this is not a simple matter: you don't have to be too enthusiastic, especially don't have too much hope.' I didn't understand after hearing his words. I asked him, 'Why?' He smiled and said, 'When people are alive, feelings are alive. When people die, feelings die. The materials for the complete works are not complete, you must ask friends for help, and this will disappoint you. I can tell you: part of the diary will take three years of work; there is one novel that will never be possible; plus all kinds of other reasons, I am afraid it will not succeed until nine years later, if you don’t believe me, wait and see!' At that time, I really didn't believe it, so I didn't think much of it after waking up. I continued to work actively, until later, and even until now, I completely believed it. The facts are indeed correct. Zhimo was exceedingly intelligent when he was alive, and still exceedingly intelligent after his death!"</p>
<p>She paused, lit a cigarette, but didn't finish smoking it. The cigarette was trembling in her hand, and in the faint light of the cigarette, I could see her silently weeping.</p>
<p>"I have collected a lot of materials for the complete works by begging from east to west, but I am only missing three diaries and one translated novel. The diary is Zhimo's only unpublished work. After Zhimo's death, one of Zhimo's good friends borrowed the diary to read, but it took three years to return it to me. This is a confirmation of Zhimo's words. The novel was originally with Mr. Hu Shih, and later fell into the hands of Mr. Shen Congwen. After turning around like this, it was lost. Fortunately, I managed to gather the manuscript and asked to hand it over to the Commercial Press for publication. The agreement was made one year before the War of Resistance, and it has been eight years, and I don't know if it has been lost? Or does Mr. Wang Yunwu think that Zhimo is dead, and readers have long forgotten his name, so his works have no business sense and he is unwilling to publish them again? This is the second point that confirms Zhimo's words. Probably what he meant by 'other reasons' was the War of Resistance! His soul has a premonition. Due to the frustration of this matter, I understood the truth of the so-called: 'When people are alive, feelings are alive. When people die, feelings die.'"</p>
<p>She took a few hard puffs of the cigarette. I had been listening attentively to her words and watching her actions. My heart was filled with infinite distress and emotion!</p>
<p>"Zhimo has been dead for fourteen years," she uttered these tearful words, one word at a time, heavily. "The world has been without him for fourteen years, and it has destroyed me forever!"</p>
<p>She stopped speaking. At this moment, I could faintly hear her heart beating rapidly, and her breathing was a little unnatural.</p>
<p>I comforted her and said:</p>
<p>"The complete works must be published. If Mr. Wang Yunwu doesn't publish them, you can hand them over to another publisher. Even if the bookstore owner thinks it has faded its golden color, the Chinese literary scene regards it as precious. Mr. Zhimo will not be forgotten by people, and he will live forever in the memory of readers!"</p>
<p>I also advised her:</p>
<p>"Spring is coming soon, and everything will start anew. I hope you will also cheer up from now on. Staying in the house all the time is not good for your health. You should go out as much as possible, even go further, because traveling is also a good medicine for invigorating the spirit."</p>
<p>She accepted my opinion, and was very moved to promise me that she would start to walk out of her small building and come to my place, and then her old friends would arrive in Shanghai one after another, and she would run around everywhere again. In this way, I think it will not be difficult for her to regain her health, and it will not be difficult to recall her pleasant mood!</p>
<p>Fearing that she was too tired, I stood up to say goodbye. Walking out the door, it was already dusk. Stepping on a fallen leaf again, I walked back home, feeling heavier than when I came, and quietly blessing Ms. Lu Xiaoman, who had lost Mr. Xu Zhimo!</p>
<p>December 6, 1945, in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Bits of History from the Pen</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>— Murong Sui</p>
<p>In these times, talking about friends really makes one feel nothing but "emptiness" and "bewilderment"! Children come home from school, jumping and shouting, sometimes singing "Good friends! Good friends, let's hold hands!" Yet, in a moment, they are arguing again. It truly annoys the elderly, but the only way to deal with it is to use "silence," ignoring them completely. Clearly, this is the elderly's wonderful method for dealing with all troubles.</p>
<p>Speaking of friends: "Friend, you should think things through more openly." Someone one rank above you will only use "rascal, son of a bitch" to teach you, their friend, a lesson. If you want "revenge," the only thing to do is use "rascal, son of a bitch" on a friend one rank below you. If there's no one below you, you can only go home and vent your anger on the group of snotty-nosed kids you support!</p>
<p>"Rascal!" What "account" is being "muddled?" Of course, these days everyone wants to "muddle along" with their friends. They only sell on "credit" everywhere. What is called friendship is just everyone "muddling along"!</p>
<p>Your "superior" scolds you; you then pass it on and scold your "inferior." This way everyone sells on "credit," and only then can they "muddle along." Take the snotty-nosed kids in your home, for example; they aren't wronged either. Who told them to be born without bringing banknotes? Taking a bite of rice and drinking a sip of porridge should be "accounted" for. Little friends: being able to "muddle" the "account" is already a bargain!</p>
<h3>Magnolia Flower Slow</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>The surrender platform has been built, leaving the red leaves to fall desolately. I remember crossing the Bajiang River in the mist, wandering through the Three Temples, and the snow falling on the Tianshan Mountains. Climbing straight up Mount Sumeru on a camel's back, I watched the Yellow River flow out of Yumen Pass. Drifting as a guest on the Jialing River, tears wet my marching clothes for eight years! Looking at each other, our hair is white, and our faces are childlike. The tea is bitter and the plum is sour. Entrusting the clear wind of both places and the bright moon of one day, I cherish the frost and cold. In the severe winter, the weather is cold and the ground is frozen. I advise you to lie high in your green quilt and not turn over lightly. Just listen to the flowing clouds and flowing water, and the clear sounds that halt the dust of the mortal world.</p>
<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Weekly Review of Financial Business - Public Bonds Rise Alone, Commodity Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>Finance: This week's financial situation in the city saw continued easing of credit. The daily interest rate of 1,000 yuan remained steady at 30 cents. The black market interest rate was threatened by the decline in commodity prices. Citizens favored currency over goods, and hoarders sold goods for cash, no longer borrowing for speculative purposes at high interest. The rate retreated from 13 cents to 10 cents, equivalent to 100 yuan per month for every 1,000 yuan. Spot gold initially reached a peak of 780,000 yuan, but then, due to optimism about the situation in North China and the Nine Provinces of the East, the impending start of international free trade, the establishment of Anglo-American loan agreements, and the reopening of foreign banks in Shanghai, sellers rushed in, and market prices gradually fell. On Friday, the low reached 763,000 yuan. Finally, because the gold price in Chongqing still stood at over 840,000 yuan, there was much arbitrage and profit-taking to cover short positions, causing it to rebound to 683,000 yuan at closing, still down 94,000 yuan from the previous week. Silver remained steady at 650 yuan. Silver coins rose from 420 yuan to 455 yuan because farmers in rural areas needed to exchange them for rice. U.S. dollars fell because foreign banks were reopening, foreign exchange would soon recover, and importers and exporters no longer needed to hoard U.S. dollars as collateral. Those holding goods became less interested, and the pressure on those arbitraging gold and U.S. dollars increased. At the end of the week, the low reached 1,060 yuan, and the final closing was 1,090 yuan, a sharp drop of 218 yuan from the previous week.</p>
<p>Securities: Since the CCP declared that it would not prevent the central government from taking over the Northeast, buyers of unified government bonds were excited, and there was even talk of a short squeeze on unified bonds. The price soared from 405 yuan to 610 yuan. Although it suddenly dropped to 540 yuan at closing due to profit-taking by bulls, it was still up 15 yuan from the previous week. Currently, those holding unified bonds have a fantasy that customs gold will be used to repay the principal and interest. Major stocks generally have a relationship with counterfeit currency increasing capital, which must be strictly reorganized and cannot be transferred. There is a severe shortage of new buyers, and both popular large and small stocks fell. Foreign stocks fell due to the hint of falling gold prices and the fact that foreign businesses would be subject to Chinese law after reopening. New buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Ewo Cotton Mill shares fell 280 yuan to 1,400 yuan, and Jardine Matheson also retreated from 4,200 yuan to 3,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Goods: Regarding commodities, rice prices fell due to the arrival of Wuhu, inland, and Taiwanese rice. Furthermore, with the relocation of the Third Route Army, the security of the rice-producing areas around Taihu Lake improved, and households no longer blindly hoarded rice. The price gradually fell. On Thursday, thick japonica rice once fell to 6,000 yuan, and passenger indica rice even dropped to 5,000 yuan. Finally, because inland rice prices rose, it rebounded to 7,000 yuan (indica rice) to 8,000 yuan (japonica rice), still down 1,000 yuan from the previous week. Flour prices fell because large quantities of relief flour wheat were being shipped to Shanghai and would soon be sold publicly at reduced prices. Furthermore, rice was cheaper than flour, and the price of No. 1 flour, 49 pounds per bag, retreated from 3,300 yuan to 2,600 yuan. Edible oil shipments from Qingdao, Bengbu, and Changzhou continued to arrive, and hoarders sought to sell. After a low of 15,000 yuan was once discovered, it rebounded to 19,000 yuan due to purchases by consumers and local oil stores. Sugar prices rose because the customs' reduced selling price increased, and Taiwanese sugar could not be freely exported. The buying price of Xinghua white sugar rose from 48,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, and No. 24 coarse granulated sugar even rose by 5,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. Raw cotton prices dropped because American cotton was fixed at 24.45 cents. After the price of gold fell sharply with the U.S. dollar, the calculated price became cheaper, and Chinese cotton was greatly affected. Tongzhou American-type cotton fell sharply from 70,000 yuan to 55,000 yuan. Pudong Huoji flower fell to 30,000 yuan, and Zhoupu seed flower sold for only 5,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan from the previous week. Cotton yarn saw slightly more sales in the Yangtze River area, but it lacked support due to the daily decline in raw cotton prices, falling from 80,000 yuan to 480,000 yuan from the previous week. Morale was weak, there were labor strikes in silk factories, and silk mills had very sluggish demand. High-grade factories had already fallen into the 1 million yuan range, and raw silk only cost 410,000 yuan. 120-count artificial silk Tianqiao fell sharply by 200,000 yuan, suddenly seeing a new low of 380,000 yuan since late October. Fuel deliveries arrived continuously by land and water. The price of white coal fell from 330,000 yuan per ton to 270,000 yuan, but the retail price did not ease. In short, all commodity prices were in a state of large decline with small rebounds. (Chongbo)</p>
<h3>Why Is Type C the Only One Rising?</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in this city have generally been declining, but only public bonds have been soaring. Although it is said to be stimulated by rumors such as the reorganization of the new currency and the repayment of silver dollars, the unified government bonds are the same. Why is the value of Type A only half that of Type C? Isn't the capital being repaid by lottery in Chongqing! After switching to using the legal tender to bid, it has been crazily raised to more than five times the face value. Although it is said to be supporting national credit, on the other hand, it is suppressing the credit of the legal tender. If you want to pursue the reason for its rise, what is the basis? I think it would be simpler to talk about the transaction method of public bond trading.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no formal legal venue for public bond trading. The number of firms engaged in public bond trading is only about 30. They usually gather in the corridor on the seventh floor of the stock exchange and adopt a spot delivery system. However, the goods delivered by the seller must be attached with interest coupons for the year 1942. At the same time, tickets with a face value of less than 1,000 yuan or slightly damaged are rejected. It is estimated that the total number of transactions per day is only about 10 million yuan in face value, of which more than half are Type C, more than 30% are Type E, and Types A, B, and D account for less than 20%. The most familiar type, Type C, is worth about 30 million legal tender at a price of 600 yuan. Only about 40 gold bars are needed to manipulate the entire bond market. Moreover, Shanghai has plenty of crazy retail investors. Most of the public bonds held by the financial sector were moved west after the enemy occupied the concession. Therefore, the demand for public bonds with interest coupons for the year 1942 is actually very limited, not to mention the various picky requirements.</p>
<p>Since there are the above-mentioned restrictions on public bond trading and delivery, if an outsider rashly goes short based on economic theory, then at 3:00 PM (closing time), under the manipulation and monopoly of those in the industry, they will be squeezed to the point of suffocation. Unless the authorities set a deadline for claiming the public bond interest coupons left behind in the occupied areas, they will continue to treasure them like jade. Then, what does the current price of five times mean? (Jingzhi)</p>
<h3>Book Value of Capital and Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>— Xiaohui</p>
<p>Whether the book value of capital is converted from counterfeit currency to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1 or 2 to 1, it is only a matter of reducing a few "zeros" in the books. As far as the enterprise itself is concerned: assets are assets, and the book value is the book value. The increase or decrease in the book value will not affect the increase or decrease in assets. Therefore, the proportion of rights that shareholders can claim against the company will always be the same, no matter how the conversion is done.</p>
<p>The government's order to convert counterfeit currency to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1 in consideration of the people in the occupied areas is purely about the currency. There is no clear order on how the book value of capital should be converted. Therefore, the saying that "the book value of capital should be converted at a rate of 200 to 1" is inferred from the above order and is not a mandatory regulation. Therefore, while it cannot be said that 200 to 1 has no basis, there is absolutely no violation of laws or regulations in 2 to 1 or even 1 to 1.</p>
<p>However, the analysis and combination of the book value of capital is greatly related to the book value of profits. This is because the prices of goods calculated in counterfeit currency are not in the same ratio as the prices of goods calculated in legal tender. The levy of income tax and profit tax is based on the ratio of profits to capital, which determines the rate of levy. Therefore, if the book value of capital must be converted at a rate of 200 to 1, then what store has no inventory? What goods are not above the 200 to 1 ratio? So, at the end of the year, what account will not be dazzling?</p>
<p>The increase in tax revenue is certainly of great benefit to the government's finances. However, this profit is ultimately fictitious. Whether it is affordable for the private industrial and commercial sectors after eight years of exploitation to use fictitious profits to pay real taxes, not to mention draining the pond to catch all the fish, the government, which intends to support the private economy, would not do this.</p>
<p>And suppose the government had completely ignored the counterfeit currency from the beginning, and the counterfeit currency had all become waste paper. Then, if we insist on confusing the currency with the book value of capital, shouldn't the current industrial and commercial capital be converted into a "zero" as well? When the current value of the company's assets is expressed in the books, should it all be treated as profit?</p>
<p>Therefore, the reorganization of the book value of capital cannot be generalized, and the conversion rate of currency cannot be used. The key lies in the issue of fictitious profits and real taxes. In today's situation of widespread decline in purchasing power and the inability of the industrial and commercial sectors to recover, I would like to offer the government the saying "it is better to nurture the source than to open up the source."</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Silk Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th] Hangzhou is known for its silk production. After the war, almost all factories have resumed operations, and production and sales are also smooth. It is now known that market prices have fallen by a quarter in recent days due to the impact of the decline in various commodity prices. Sales are sluggish, and there seems to be a continued downward trend.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Sugar Exchanged for Soybean Cake</h3>
<p>Yu Baixi, general manager of the Taiwan Trading Company, told reporters that important export materials from Taiwan, such as sugar, rice, and coal, are under the centralized management of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. The Taiwan Trading Company is a "business organization" directly under the jurisdiction of Governor Chen. Its only task is to handle the barter trade between Taiwan Province and the mainland. The first measure taken by the company after its establishment was to exchange the first batch of more than 1,000 dan of sugar shipped to Shanghai with 10,000 sheets of soybean cake from the group organization of more than 160 sugar merchants here, and transport them to Taiwan to alleviate the severe fertilizer panic currently facing the vast farmlands of Taiwan Province.</p>
