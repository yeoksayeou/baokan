<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本決戰力量的根源</h3>
<p>冲縄島的決戰，是日本本土大決戰的前哨，一方面敵美在按近日本本土之前，爲冲繩島上陸作戰而喪失了五百六十餘艘艦船，幷且在島上柑持戰鬥中又犧牲了六萬餘兵卒，其作戰計畫不能不因此遲延，全軍士氣也不能不因此受挫，他方面，因爲冲縄島日軍守衛部隊的勇鬥，航空特攻隊的猛擊，使敵美自稱絕對優勢的機動部隊屢次工崩瓦解，上陸部隊亦感到進退維谷，所以日本本士得以充分凖備，所謂「日本本土鐵壁要塞化」之設施，就是因爲有這時間的有利條件，才能著著推進，具體實現。我們不僅應該爲仲繩島作戰之壯烈而讚歡，而日應該注意到在整個戰局上冲繩島堅守的深刻意義。</p>
<p>現在，敵美正想突破那霸與首里一綫而南下，然而日本守衛軍隊正竭力反復加以攻擎。仲縄岛防衛的主力，正發揮其最大的效能，雖然目前也不能避免補給上的孤立，然而對於敵美依然有著以逸待勞的作戰要素，況且因爲沖繩島民的同甘共苦，誓死協力，所以除了地利之外，又有人和的優良條件。據前綫某報道特派員之報告，在敵美的砲擊之下，冲縄島民乘黃昏暗夜，依然挿秧佈種。這稱愛護鄉土，增加生產的精神很是可敬的。從道一點便可以想像沖繩島民站在決戰第一綫的沉著應戰的程度了。</p>
<p>幷且，我們更可以山此推想日本本土國民的態度和決心。日本都市在連日轟炸之下，焚毀的地方固然很多，可是因此都市受災的市民更敵愾同仇，疏散到農村去的，則努力於農作物的增產，立志投身到各地的工廠去的，則貢獻於軍需資材的增產，對於決戰的戰力反而可以增加不少。敵美的轟炸日木各都市，可以說反而造成日本各地迅速的完成防衛的設備。「日本本土鐵壁要塞化」能够在短時期內吿成，就是因爲這綠故吧。</p>
<p>近代戰爭的特微是決戰的連續，雖然冲繩島的決戰意義比以前幾次決戰嚴重多了，然而在日本本土大決戰之觀點上看來，冲繩島也不過是最近日本本土的先衛。而日本本土的一寸一分都是日本國民的生命，日本國民爲保衛其本土，必定背城決戰，予敵美以迎首痛擊。敵美機動部隊遊弋於九州海面，已徑兩月有餘，然而尙不敢貿然一試，便是深知日本決戰力量的根源在日本本土之故。</p>
<p>日本各地不但分駐著精銳的部隊’完成了堅固的要塞，幷且日本國民全體便是舉國一致的義勇隊，日本國民的戰意如鐵一般的堅固，日本本土更因此籌成了鐵壁的要塞。</p>
<h3>上山英三氏稱　臺灣戰塲化</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　沖繩戰局日趨緊急，台灣島之重要性，亦隨之增加，敵軍擬依冲繩作戰截斷日本土與南方之連擊，且使台灣孤立，台灣全島現己遍地堅壘，全島民眾於敵機會炸之下，毅然各安其業。最近台灣銀行董事上山英三氏，由台灣來京，並暢述如次：臺灣經五十年之治績，能有今日之結果，實堪　嘆。長谷用總督之皇民化運动，可謂完全成功，該島民眾，皆以臺國之臣民自居，而振起死守皇土之強志，例如護國勤勞隊，刻鎭日於軍部指揮之下，以衝撞精神從事增產與建設。現在全島業完全成爲堅如鐵壁之要壘，而此勤勞隊每寄身於生產工塲，晝夜捨身增產，此外，尚有早已組成之國民義勇隊，刻正準備改編爲戰鬥隊。至於食糧一項，則竭力開發荒地廠地，力謀增加產量，故無論如何延長，食糧情形絕無不安之虞，邇來敵機轟炸逐日執拗，但居民却平靜如昔，亳無不安之熊，市鄉屋舍，雖大部業被炸毀，然居民仍於廢墟中營其戰時生活。被炸之各都市，凡有機能即日恢復原狀，野戰郵局等。亦於臨時籌備之幕舍中辦理郵務’台灣全島，今已成職塲色彩。</p>
<h3>日伊藤正德氏　論決戰意義　轉取攻勢以打開難局</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日軍事評論家伊藤正德氏，就近代戰之決戰意義談述如次：大東亞戰爭開始以來，已經數次泱戰，此皆吾人熟知者，新加坡爭奪戰亦決戰之一，瓜達卡納爾一役後，敵我問　次展開決戰，例如新加坡爭奪戰，乃爲我方欲確保向南方前進戰略據點之決戰，馬來海面決戰乃擊減敵東亞艦隊之決戰，而菲島決戰乃使重創敵軍之決戰，如此經過各種目的之決戰，可達成最後決戰，使敵軍蒙致命重創。茲舉一實例，即第一次歐戰時之北丹要塞攻防戰，德國開戰二年後，開始攻擊北丹，其目的並非欲攻陷北丹要塞，藎如攻擊此重要陣地，則法軍必欲死守該地，而集結大兵力，若是，則德軍可乘機重創法軍戰力，使海軍兵力減低，結果德軍遂開始攻擊北丹要塞，終於發展爲世界　目之爭奪戰。當時全世界所注目考，並非僅德國欲消耗法國戰力一點，蓋北丹攻防職其後終被迫發展爲要塞爭奪戰，法德兩方當時各損傷兵員四十餘萬，結果德軍創傷敵軍之決戰，德軍日身亦蒙受相當劍傷，法軍則一敗塗地，由是可知決戰之目的及性質，可因敵我兩軍戰力之强弱而發生巨大樊化。決戰決非單純固定不變者，吾人試就日美之決戰觀察敵軍戰術，則可知美軍採取自南北戰爭以來一貫不變戰術，尼米資所謂「跳島戰術」，亦非新創，無非根據南北戰事以來之舊思想戰術，當時北軍曾以「放棄防衛嚴備之敵軍陣地，而進攻容易突破之戰綫，再向前躍進」之冒險攻擊戰術，獲得成功，此盡與停比攻擊拉伏爾及台灣之戰綫熊同。又創造機動部隊之思想，亦與此同，於敵軍來癳意料之各地出現，突加攻擊，故吾人可名之爲突式戰綫。日軍戰綫頗多特色，一言盡之此種日本職術，必須把握轉移攻勢機會，若不於冲縄造成此種機會，則欲達成目的，更須於他處另尋有利之時機及地利，此乃近代決戰常職，且係必然之事實。換言之，亦即近代戰爭之機動性，戰爭必須以攻擊獲勝，必須反覆展開決戰以定終局，故爲打開難局，唯轉向攻勢。</p>
<h3>渝軍現正積極作總反攻準備</h3>
<p>柬京八日中央社電　渝方於去年十二月二十五日在昆明設置中國陸軍司令部，任命渝軍總參謀長何應欽爲總司令官，隷其指揮下者有衛立煌之緬甸遠征軍。湯恩伯之黔桂湘邊區軍。盧漢之滇越邊區軍及張發奎之第四戰區軍，均屬折代裝備之渝軍中堅部隊。渝軍此項措置，蓋欲當美國海軍在中國大陸登陸作戰一朝實現之秋，內地之渝軍即同時響應，俾在海陸方面挾擊日軍。按渝軍對日反攻之總部設在昆明者，因將來於空中掩護作戰之美第十四航空隊及擔當重行訓練及指導作戰之麥伊亞少將之駐華美戰鬥部隊，均將其司令部設在昆明，基於彼此密切聯絡之必要，渝軍旣不能獨力行動，萬事必須倚顆美空軍之協力，故渝軍高呼之對日總反攻，實亦不必驚駭。惟我人不能輕視者，即最近美國對重慶之軍事援助頓加積極，美國除圖加強中印航空路之輸送能力外，同時，對於由印度至北緬密芝那之印度公路運結及舊　緬公路之援渝輸血路之打通計劃，大致告成功，如是重慶軍之總反攻準備，刻正節節進展。但因美軍之中國大陸登陸作戰尚未具體化，致不能獲得機會，但美軍在沖繩之苦戰愈深刻化，彼等期望渝軍在大陸之積極活動亦愈切，故美海軍之大陸登陸作戰，不論何時實行，渝軍之總反攻則早晚必將發動也。</p>
<h3>史蒂威爾在菲會晤麥克沃塞</h3>

<h3>國民政府宣戰佈吿</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日，大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與龍邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，著手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等仍治用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方份子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第爲友邦日本陸海空軍所繫破，侵略柬亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀，且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，嗾使渝方份子，不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處，屢施轟炸，殘害平民。有渝方份子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛逆，固屬可恥；而英美對於東亞處心積盧，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤爲東亞民族所常同仇敵愾。國民政府爲此宣告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，常悉實全力，與友邦日本協力。一掃英美之殘暴，以謀巾國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益特提携，以期共同建設以道義爲基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秋序有所貢獻。凡我國民，當知此爲實現　國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共熒建設之實現，世界全體正義和平之獲得，胥繫於此；其一心一德，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命。中華民國三十二年一月九日</p>

<h3>浙東觀感（二）</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>紹興之行（上）</p>
<p>蕭紹途中</p>
<p>乘車離蕭山，同行汽車計有三輛，每車皆有盟邦警備隊五六名隨車保護。記者爲探詢沿途治安情況，遂與同車之旅客攀談。據吿最近蕭紹公路上曾於五月七八兩日在楊汎橋附近，連遭遊匪截刦，除財物之損失外，旅客之遭綁　及遇害者共計十二人，大有談虎色變之勢。沼途一般旅客之心理，至爲繫張。不圖車行僅半小時過「錢淸鎭」時，前車車胎損壞，停車修理，以地屬危險區，盟軍皆下車登高處，架槍實彈，作臨時警備。幸廿分鐘後已修妥，繼積前進。</p>
<p>兩小時半後抵「柯橋」（距紹興念五里），沿公路有名「官塘」之小河並行。河之中央有石堤（俗名率堤），仍供載重貨船之船夫拉牽步行其上，拖船而進，河岸兩旁皆爲「塘地」，適於大小麥之種植。</p>
<p>再半句鐘「府山」在望，已抵紹興，車停「胡小姐」廟旁之廣塲中，亦即華中自動車紹興營業所之所在地，下車後前往浙江省第五區專員公署訪問，適專員虞兆麟氏，因公赴杭，當由該公署秘書坐任高康洲氏接待。聞最近杭甬公路，曹娥江彼岸百官至寗波段，橋樑數座被燬，已停軍三日，何時開行尙難預料。祇得小住候車，同時乘機考察。</p>
<p>人口統計</p>
<p>紹興城垣已無，全縣分十區，事變前全境居民共一百二十萬人，現僅存七十餘萬人。以縣府所在之城區言，其情勢適反，即事變前全城祇有居已七萬餘人，自三十年四月十七日友軍進駐紹興後，治安較有保障，而四鄉則以遊匪充斥，殷實之家，皆率眷移居城區，尤以三十一年六月恢復紹興縣治後，其增加之速率更甚。茲城區已有人滿之患，據最近之統計，已達十三萬五千餘人。</p>
<p>一般風光</p>
<p>紹與城區繫華所在，類皆集中於大淸路，全街計長約兩里，南自「江橋「起北抵」淸道橋一，最奇特者，雖屬同街，但各商店之門牌街名則巽，如「淸風里口」，「軒亭口」，「大善寺前」名目至夥，其數約在十數以上。</p>
<p>全街獨多西藥房，其名稱，凡舉滬上著名之大藥房，則情具備。除此外銀樓與百貨店亦多，獨書店與文具店，付諸缺如。</p>
<p>又紹興仍有三事異於外鄉者，目前仍有年近古稀之老婦，着大紅　鞋趨步街頭。而奔馳街中之車夫，則人各一鈴，釘鐺過市。商店中之夥友每於顧客購貨時，例有報賬之舉，口中念念有詞，如誦歌曲，與街頭車夫之鈴聲，互相呼應，頗饒興味。</p>
<p>名產箔酒</p>
<p>紹興之錫箔與酒馳名遐邇，盛極一時，前者茲以目下交通之不便，原料「點銅」（來自外埠）運輸成本之加重，與夫戰時民生艱難，非必須品銷路大減，致該業已一蹶不振，後者當地雖據有極合釀酒之「鑑湖」泉水，（該湖之水一擔，較他處同等量水，其重量每担較重念四斤，以水質之重，故做成酒後易於保存，不致變質。）然目前交通不暢，而原料糯米又須仰諸於蘇州與常州兩地，來源欠暢，該業中人爲減輕成本起見，大批釀四師已陸續遷往蘇常工作，故現今紹興當地之釀酒業，已趨沒落，僅及戰前十分之一二。</p>
<p>敎育槪況</p>
<p>全縣小學計有兩百餘所，中學縣立者一，私立者三，至民眾教育則有縣立之圖書館及民眾教育館各一所，教員之待過，中學教師除月薪四千元外，僅有學米三斗，小學敎師學米相同，而薪金僅二千元。</p>
<p>治安現況</p>
<p>目前紹興全縣，除駐有盟軍外，並有浙江省保安第三團。及縣警三百餘人，城區治安較爲安定，已如前述，四郊則時有遊匪出沒，故對縣政之推進上至感困難。所轄三·五·九三區，因環境之特殊，決非縣府實力之所能及，餘則可稱半安全區。</p>
<h3>大國否決權問題　仍僵持不決　三頭會議近期內舉行</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據華盛頓訊二美總統特魯曼昨夜宣稱：邱吉爾·史太林及渠本人之會議，將於最近之四十日內召開。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據倫敦訊，路透社外交記者日昨接獲消息靈通者之情報：英政府爲打開因大國否決權問題而陷入苦境之舊金山會議僵局，業已直接向史太林提出牒文。成爲目前舊金山會議焦點之所謂否決權問題，是否將移牒於史太林特魯曼及丘吉爾三巨頭，現在加以推屢尙嫌過早。據可靠情報，傳史太林元帥已同意於最近宛將來舉行三頭會議，惟日期尚未決定。然舊金山會議開會已久，仍未結束，處不能永久拖延，英國雖極願早日獲得圓滿結束，然蘇聯則完全拒絕妥協。蘇聯代表團自六月二日接獲關於否決權問題之莫斯科訓令後，曾聲明反對安全保障理事會之保留否決權問題。英美兩國雖贊成將拒絕之使用，限定於「行動」階段，但反對將否央權擴大爲調查。建議。及行動之三階段。蘇聯之主張，以爲否決權應保留爲僅關於手續之問題。然根本反對大國行使否決權之小國羣，絕對反對蘇聯之見解，各小國所以敢搖旗吶喊，聞因得美國英國法國及重慶之支持。故若隊聯固執成苦，將莫能得大會之支持，反之，若固執反對蘇聯之主張，蘇聯或將拒絕世界機構。在史太林元帥對此問題作新的檢討以前，此問題難望有新發展，世界輿論業已認識否決機問題之重要性</p>
<h3>宋返渝途次　將訪莫斯科</h3>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　據重慶電稱：現仍滯在舊金山之宋子文，將於返渝之際，便道訪問莫斯科，與史太林會談。按此當爲根據渝六全大會主要決議之改善對蘇外交案，對戰後中國有利害密切關係，且擁有强大實力之蘇聯傳送秋波。然宋氏訪蘇之使命，不外　關於西南亞細亞地域問題之妥協，　對延安問題之解決，　西北方面之軍事政治經濟上之決定等二一點。又對延安問題之解決，二日據延安新華社解放日報之社節稱，蔣介石於六全大會席上，依然視國共問題爲國內政治問題，不改變其歷來所持熊度。關於此種問題，誠如周恩來所謂重慶如不放棄其政治之矛盾，即其獨裁及反動行動，延安決始終與重慶不斷抗爭，對渝方表示强硬態度。一方隨同歐戰之終結，蘇聯以獨自之立塲，企圖運動邊境新疆陝西之軍事政治經濟，以擴大其勢力，今令宋子文極力獻媚蘇聯，然是否可獲得圓滿結果，尚屬疑問。</p>
<p>美蘇勢力互相角逐</p>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　延安方面之七全大會席上，毛澤東發表驚人之宣言以來，渝共燮方之關係逆轉，再由政治抗爭而瀕臨武力衝突之危機，延安軍對於重慶第十戰區之包圍情勢，及向江西省瑞金之南進企圖，現渝共問題以芙蘇勢力作背景，頓引起國際之注意，其動向極值注自，最折渝方廣東省發行之大眾報曾揭戰渝府日前舉行六全大會時，正式否認外蒙共和國，據該報論稱，渝方對於外蒙古，與以最大之自治權力，祖外蒙依照一九二四年所訂立中蘇條約，旣曾正式保障其爲中國領土，故一九二一年成事之外蒙共和國，自不能加以承認云云，又傳最近新疆省內之渝軍，曾與哥薩克兵武力衝突，當茲對重慶之美蘇勢力之角逐漸濃之際，此次重慶政府之正式否認外蒙共和國，此點足値注目</p>
<h3>伊新閣組織中</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據蒂赫倫訊：前伊朗司法部大臣薩特安，昨日受命組織新內閣，伊期國會內各領袖黨派昨日以六十票對八票之絕對多數，擁謹薩特安組織新閣。</p>
<h3>法建義召開　五國會議　討論中東問題</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　據巴黎報告稱：法政府蛤日對駐法倫敦。華盛頓。莫斯科。重慶之法大使發出訓令，並囑彼等將法政府所提出召開「五強聯會」討論中東問題之建議，向上述四國政府傳遞。</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據此間接獲消息，英國駐中東事務大臣格里克昨在開羅宣稱，英政府反對法建議以一五强聯會」解決中東之各項問題，英政府月前主經該項會議中應參加之各國，以美·英。法及里文達各國爲限。</p>
<h3>西引渡賴伐爾</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　前法首長賴伐爾，於德國投降之前，曾避難於西班牙巴塞隆納附近地區，遭西班牙當局逮捕拘禁，直至本月五日由空路送回法國。</p>

<h3>劉經濟局長談最近經濟施政　記者例會中解答問題</h3>
<p>市宣傳處主持之第二十次記者例會，於昨（八）日上午十時半，在市會議室舉行，由經濟局長劉星晨出席解答各報社所提問題。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>施政方針</p>
<p>（問）今後推進經濟施政方針如何？（答）本局經濟施政，以奉行中央法令，秉承市當局意旨積極推行，其處理經濟法案，惟求合法合理，事務方面在敏捷迅速，期將動盪不安之經濟狀態，逐漸納入正軌。</p>
<p>重點配給</p>
<p>（問）理點配給三月份下半期，即吿脫期，迄未補發，最近有否恢復希望？（答）現正向有關方面商請撥米中，一俟領到，當視數量，分別恢復配給及補發。</p>
<p>（問）市物品配給處撤銷，移歸經濟局接辦後，對於今後戶口配給，有無具體計劃？（答）對於戶口配給，仍在積極辦理，所有第六十一號至九十號綜合配給證，正在趕發中。最近憑四十七號綜合配給證戶麵粉每證一市斤，價仍為四百元。其他物品亦正隨時給辦，祗須來源稍暢，自可陸續配發。</p>
<p>（問）本期重點配給何時可以發放？（答）米到即可配給。</p>
<p>抑平物價</p>
<p>（問）最近兩週以來，本市物價漲勢益厲，各廠商門售市價，均超過限價達三倍左右，影響民生至鉅，貴局對此有何處置辦法？抑平物價，將取何種步驟？（答）最近商店門售市價，超越限價，當由警察局派經濟繁察加緊調查，一經查實定予嚴懲。關於抑平物價，除嚴厲評訂及執行限價外，巳與有關當局，商採緊急措置。</p>
<p>（問）各商店時有未經核准而擅自抬高助長物價漲風，莫此為甚。嗣後貴局對各物限價，可發給一公吿之限價表，命令各商店將售物之限價表，張掛於顯明地位，以防商人舞弊。同時各同業公會方面也應負監督之責，貴局對此項措置，至今未見實行，其故安在？（答）商店發售商品，應具備標　，標明售價，並將核准價目，黏貼於屋內顯明之處。本局已三令五申，通飭遵照，最近除通令各公會負責督飭外，並呈准市府刋發報告，如違依法懲處。最近正嚴行辦理，由警察局執行。</p>
<p>（問）大餅與熟水商業為市民生活，關聯至鉅者，最近非法擅自抬高售價，貴局對之有何懲處辦法？（答）關於懲處大餅與熟水兩業，非法抬價，巳由警察局嚴查辦理。</p>

<p>强化公會</p>
<p>（問）强化各業公會機構及人事之情形如何？（答）查同業公會為工商業之同業集團，其主旨端在協助政府推行經濟政策及謀同業之公共福利，但一般公會負查人大都在商言商，往往偏重於其營業上之便利，而忽視協助政府推行經濟政策。在目前最要莫如防止囤積。抑平物價，然欲達到此目的，必須公會本身健全，並須澈底明瞭同業之營業情况，故正積極强化同業機構，整飭公會負責人選，並由各業公會增設調查登記組，調查同業會員貨物之進出。本局巳將本市各業公會最近狀况調查完竣，刻正審察各業情形，釐訂强化組織健全人事等辦法，以期調整。</p>
<p>商品登記</p>
<p>（問）主要商品登記情形如何？（答）本局辦理主要商品登記移動許可事宜，經依照主要商品品目表，共有八種：　纖維類，　化學工業品，　工葉油脂，　橡膠，　五金，　電氣材料，　皮革原料，　白報紙。（招貼紙）暨行政院核定四項原則，呈奉市府及實業部核准，定期辦理登記，並令飭各主要商品同業公會，轉行各會員邀辦，截至目前止，已遵令來局登記者，計有百貨公司，化學工業原料等公會，尙有其他公會未據塡送登記表薄，正在令催趕辦。</p>
<p>恢復廠電</p>
<p>（問）各業工廠停電已久，影響增產甚大，一般工業用電，有無恢復希望？（答）查各工廠請求恢復用電，本局曾於本年一月及三月間，將各工廠塡報之用電調查表，送請華中水電公司設法酌量配給用電。惟目前煤斤缺乏，亦係實情，正在商洽辦理中。</p>
<p>米價飛漲</p>
<p>（問）最近米價飛漲，倘貴局能將戶口米按期配給，是為最有實効之抑止辦法，遺局有此考慮否？（答）正與有關方面商討中。</p>
<p>（問）關於「決抑止食米漲風」及「積極疏通來源」兩項措置，現下貴局進行之具體情形如何？（答）關於「決抑止米價漲風」已與警察局切實執行，懲處非法米商。至「積極疏通來源」，現正會同有關當局竭力籌劃進行。</p>

<h3>堅如鐵壁的日本本土要塞　一億軍民正待殲敵良機</h3>
<p>正當冲繩決戰日益劇烈之際，日本本土的要塞化亦吿完成。日本本土的要塞化究竟是怎麼一回事呢，頗為人所欲知。蓋自瓜達爾卡那爾一役以來，駐守太平洋戰綫孤島上的日軍精銳，往往在敵軍砲擊轟炸及絕對多數的兵力强襲下，壯烈玉碎。而且在歐洲戰綫方面，誇稱近代要寨精粹的馬其諾綫及齊格菲綫，均未能發揮預期的效果，而德軍在東部戰綫所築的防綫，也未能防衛柏林。由此種事實而觀，日本本土要塞雖說固若金湯，但是究能忍受敵方絨氈轟炸或其他機械化部隊的强襲至什麼程度呢？不免令人發生疑問；記者也是一個對於此點有些缺乏信念的人。然而，這種不安，這種危懼，及至視察各地以後，是完全消弭了，並且深信日本安如泰山。</p>
<p>現在，記者將日本軍民以稱築防御工程為主而凝集起來的戰力，具體記述下來，以期一新世人的認識，庶得最後勝利。</p>
<p>邀擊勢態已經改觀</p>
<p>此處必須攷處的，是敵戰力的本質。即敵美之强，强在猛烈的艦砲射擊，大規模的空襲與優的機械化裝備。</p>
<p>自瓜達爾卡那爾以至冲繩，敵美一貫的方式即為不惜物量的砲擊轟炸及優勢機械化部隊的强襲。因此，今後如果能使其轟炸化為無用，機械化部隊變成無力，則美軍便喪失其全部戰鬥力，與「武士偶人」無異。欲擊碎軟弱無力的敵軍，即使不懂孫子兵法，也無困難。唯問題是如何制止敵方的艦砲射擊，並便其空襲化為無效，阻撓其機械化部隊的侵攻。這是不易解決的問題。然而，日本的邀擊勢態今已一變。無論敵美的艦砲射擊如何猛烈，敵機的空製如何狂暴，或機械化部隊如何强襲，都能夠在本土邀戰中便之完全無力化，且可加以殲滅。至其具體的方法，不必說，就是本土要塞化</p>
<p>山川草木盡是要塞</p>
<p>而此要塞化，決非依照從來戰略思想的脆弱的防綫，而是完全根據日軍獨特的戰略與構想的。即在日本本土構築的要塞，決不是造於特定塲所或特定地帶的，這點與馬奇諾綫，齊格菲綫不同。而且構築時旣不像歐洲要塞那樣必需龐大的資材及勞動力，所費的時日也很短。因此，茍在危急之時，不數日即可有堂堂的堡壘出現，而且可視當時的戰况如何，而無限擴大其陣地，所以今日並非陣地的區域，數日後就能成為完全的要塞地帶。在進展極速的近代戰爭中。像馬奇諾綫，齊格匪綫等永久性的固定陣地，不僅在時間上趕不及，就是趕得及，也不能期待有大的效果。關於這點，此次的歐戰就是很好的證據。但日本本土的要塞可說是完全合乎近代戰的要求的。據說古代豐臣秀吉曾在一夜之內趕造了一座城，在今日瞬息必爭的戰局下，日軍設計的要塞工程更比豐臣秀吉的築城有意義，實為決定勝利的要因。</p>
<p>豐臣秀吉的築城，與今日日本本土的要塞工程，有三點不同。第一、豐臣秀吉所築的城，目的在威嚇敵軍，使之喪胆，所以形式特別雄壯威嚴，一望而知，但今日的日本本土要塞是完全隱秘起來的。在隱蔽這一點上，可說已登峰造極。其規模與精造，除設計的將校配置該處的部隊以外，別人是猜不着的。從而何處是陣地何處不是陣地，恐怕連參謀將校也不能立刻判斷出來。至於敵軍，即使派造B29型機連日連夜偵察探尋，也不能得悉其眞相的。</p>
<p>當記者初被帶入這個陣地時，映入眼簾的是和平的農村，一望祗見是新緣滴翠的明媚山河，毫無可欵之點。直到足履問題的要點等，方知一切都是可怖的要塞。</p>
<p>當然　，記者是個門外漢，對於要塞的全貌，怖陣的構想，是無由得知其詳的。但在視察此陣地一帶後，感到該處所見的出川草木，全是要塞，全是堅壘。</p>
<p>實際上，我們的山川草木全可化為城寨，而其建設又極容易，所以日本本土全部化為要塞，決不是不可能的。</p>
<p>其次與從來城寨不同之點，是古代的固定城堡有正面。側面及背面之分，而日本本土今日的要塞則無特定之面，可隨當時戰况而成左或右，說明白些，即有進可以攻退可以守的軟性。如馬其諾綫。齊格菲等僅　到正面的要塞綫，一旦為敵軍在一點突破而迂迴到背後時，便手足無措了。可是，日本本土的要塞却能睥睨八方，不同在東西南北的任何一方，均可充分發揮威力。</p>
<p>進攻美軍必大流血</p>
<p>最後一點，即如本文最初所述，不受地域的限制，這在過去永久性的固定陣地是夢想不到的。今日築於日本本土的要塞，得隨需要而擴大移動，所以即使某一地點的城郭陷入敵軍重圍中，也不必擔憂。蓋於那種塲合之下，祗須費去若干時間，稍事工作一下，即可自由和鄰接的堅壘連絡，又能應付新的戰局了。</p>
<p>總而言之，這樣的本土要塞完成時，敵美無論怎樣投入大量物資，急於實行本土作戰，也難傷害日本一兵一卒，或一個農民。假使其機械部隊能夠登陸，亦難在地上發見日軍士兵，反之，將飽嘗日軍百發百中的砲火，而大量流血吧。</p>
<p>地下堡壘空前堅固</p>
<p>其次，日軍陣地何故能夠忍受敵軍砲擊轟炸與機械化部隊的强隊的强製呢？且來說明一下。日本本土的防禦工程，全在地底深處。其中，有縱橫伸展的大小交通壕及將土棲息室·彈藥庫·食糧庫·以及水井·廚房·浴室·兵舍等，一應俱備。其外側，有各種火砲陣地，均由交通壕連擊。因此，敵戰艦的主砲縱然連日連夜繼續猛射，也不過徒然掘起地表的泥土而已，對於日軍的地下陣地，是毫無影響的。敵機的轟炸，情形亦然。其空襲雖然可給都市和工廠以想像以上的損害，然而無論怎樣巨大的炸彈或燒彈，要想襲擊深在地底的陣地，也是不可能的</p>
<p>，　　的機械部隊即使能夠上陸而展開張襲，也無從猜想將由何方受到完全秘藏地下的要塞砲火攻擊。假使被其發現弱點而受到强襲時，也因日軍要塞設計早就充分考慮敵軍火燄放射器及　風的威力，所以是不感痛癢的。而且各個陣地本身的火綱與隣接陣地的相互關係，是由日軍獨特的塞城專家詳細硏究而設計的，所以全綫沒有一個死角。因此，敵用一度侵入此陣，即從西面八方受到猛烈的砲火，決難免於殲滅。</p>
<p>尤其値得注目的，就是在本土邀擊戰中，日軍全體將士均以述的地下要塞為據點，大小火砲固無論，甚至携有擲彈筒，如此堅守地下的陣綫，展開果敢的邀擊作戰，重重打擊敵軍的戰鬥力。這種虞鬥的樣式，和最近在歐洲展開的地面戰鬥比較，　可謂是戰略思想上的一大飛躍。日本本土的防禦工程，實為世界戰史上未見先例的堅陣，而在從來的太平洋戰爭中，也無其例。</p>
<p>總而言之，自從瓜達爾卡那爾一役，日軍的太平洋戰爭，以爭取時間的出血作戰為主，然而演變為本土邀擊戰時，其本質俄然一變，化為澈底殲滅美軍的作戰。因此，敵軍如侵攻日本本土，則日軍的堅强防綫將根本使他物量戰略傾覆，使其遭受決定性敗北。此點是洞若觀火的。</p>
<p>軍民團結士氣軒昂</p>
<p>其次，再來介紹一下　守堅陣的日軍將士的軒昂士氣吧。</p>
<p>總軍司令就任時，即對麾下全軍分布訓練如下：「　迅即完了戰略展開。　澈底强化築城。　精密訓練。這是殲滅敵軍的三項原則。今日的戰局，巳與日本全國化為戰塲一樣緊張。因此，為使三原則完全具體實現，繼有死傷者，亦在所不顧。由此而負傷者，皆以戰傷者　。」</p>
<p>全體將士經此激勵，土領益振，願直不分晝夜的拚命努力推進殲滅敵軍的作戰計劃。第一綫部隊的士氣，的確旺盛！尤其是原籍當地的將士，上自部隊長下至小兵，無不暫願以身殉地，意氣的軒昂，直冲斗牛。這樣的軍隊與有血統關係的當地鄕民連合起來，其勢實足粉碎數十倍，數千倍的敵國大軍。在如此的前綫，年靑的中隊長誠具有完備的城主風度。關於把握部下，收攬民心，實巳登堂入室。而其所部精銳，氣魄的雄偉亦甚可敬，一旦部署定當，雖無特別的命令，其建築堡壘壕的工程，亦晝夜兼行，繼續不輟。並且凡百築城事宜祗要示之以基本的設計圖，以後即毋須一一監督，士兵們自會加以種種獨創的意見，造成勝過預期的良好城寨。</p>
<p>儲彈無數敵來必敗</p>
<p>在第一綫上，中隊長，小隊長也滿射泥汚的親臨指揮防禦工程的進行，從而在其指揮下工作的作業班，其份于包含軍醫，獸醫以至於部隊本部的書記，他們赤裸上體，在深的坑道裏揮動鍬鏟，廢寢忘食的工作着。</p>
<p>在這裏，資材不足，勞力不足等等，一切均由獨創一格的方法予以彌補。除出必勝的信念以外，將士們別無其他念頭。在他們心中，第一是必勝，第二是必勝，第三仍是必勝！如此緊張的將士，絲毫看不出受到不自然的地下壕生活的影響。他們雖寢於壕內，工於壕內，食於壕內，却沒有一人在健康上受到損害。</p>
<p>記者被領去參觀某大砲觀測所。據某下士官說：「大砲的陣地，如剛纔參觀所見，有防音裝置。前幾日曾經試行實彈射擊，壕內一點沒有反響。不過，那時因是逆風，以致二氧化碳流入壕內，可是陣地上的人沒有誰受害。」</p>
<p>接着，他將砲座的種種情形說明給我聽，最後指　測所牆上的圖表說：「敵軍的上陸用舟艇，各種　車，以至火砲，在此表上都詳載無道。統好塲所，現在，巳有足夠粉碎敵載車數千輛的砲彈運入這個陣地，我們決不浪費一彈！」</p>
<p>呵呵，祗佔陣地一　的砲兵也能擊燬數千輛敵戰車呢！由此可知日軍全體將士的意氣。</p>
<p>準備一切待機殲敵</p>
<p>觀乎此，可知在日本本土的各地作戰。與地方民，實已密切合作，精誠團結。而且，食糧不足，資材困難和勞力缺乏切切情形，也是絕對沒有的。這一點歐洲國家洞，所以日本軍民決不會因糧食及經濟狀况而喪失戰意</p>
<p>從而日本本地的決戰勢態，亦與時日共進。益趨强化。這一點，令我　感建國三千年的歷史所培養的潛在力的偉大。我們巳在固為磐石的戰略勢態下完成戰略展開，配置精銳百萬。現在，在我必勝不數的本土要塞上，日本的一億軍宣民全體，正燃起了鬥專，等待殲敵的良機。（譯自六月七日及八日大陸新報）</p>

<p>上海市政　周　　題　第十六期</p>
<h3>丙月來之建設行政</h3>
<p>— 徐季敦</p>
<p>管理路政及防水之設施</p>
<p>本市各區路政，向稱完善，惟自事變以來，築路材料，旣吿枯竭，而經濟籌措，又感困難，致養護工程，及應予改善之各種路政計劃，均未能及早實行。過去兩月因郊區公路有關軍事，不得不提前搶修，故所有工人均集中郊外，現在郊區通路可如期完工，即將計劃市內道路之修理，及西區防水工程之實施，計劃之如何推行，亦有得而述者：查本市北站附近交通向極頻繁，時至今日，尤感寬度不足，他如滬西虹橋路及南京路北京路靜安寺路大同路大上海路泰山路等，均係市內主要幹道，因年久失修，凹凸不平，行旅　覺不便，本局現在計劃將各該幹綫，積極修築，經編造預算，呈請市府核對矣。</p>
<p>本市西區地形，向極低窪，每遇大雨，積水成潦，際茲春汛，尤易為患，本局現擬將該區重要地段，改裝巨型溝管，並將主要河流，予以疏溶，使雨水易於宣洩。查本市地下水道工程，實由房屋壓力過高，基地逐漸下移，浦江水位，因以上漲，欲言治本，必先溶浦，則規模殊大，歷年以來，均未獲完善之解決，尤非現時之財力物力所能勝，本局現於治標之中，確立治本之基，以期逐步推行，漸謀整個之解決。</p>
<p>管理營繕園林等設施</p>
<p>營繕事業之管理，不外審查計劃，關於審查事項，本局對於建築規則，為適合現時之環境起見，已重行釐訂，各項建築執照費，為適合事實，亦已擬定新費率均在呈府核准施行中。此後對於違章之建築物，將嚴加取締。</p>
<p>並規定各種建築圖樣，須一律採用公尺，以資劃一。至於計劃事項，以資劃一。至於計劃事項，本局鑒於戰爭運輸，與本市辦理疏散人口之重要，對於滬郊區各橋樑，如錫滬路自一六六號橋至一三五號橋，嘉羅路之十五號橋，滬太路自大塲至羅店段損壞之橋樑，羅寶路之馬涇橋，顓橋，蘇滬路自　南路一號橋至顧浦橋中間損博之橋樑，上松路第七，八，十號橋等之修復，均經計劃就緒，一俟市府核准後，即可招工興修矣。</p>
<p>至市民請求拆卸房屋一節，以過去流弊至深，目下對此項執照頒發，十分愼重，非符合拆卸條規，決不隨意頒給。</p>
<p>關於園林之管理，以本市人烟之稠密，房屍之櫛比，公園之着遍設立，實甚重要。查本局現在所轄之公園，計有中山，外　、虹口，通北，大興，泰山，迪化，衡山等，經竭力整頓後，設備漸　完善，近更為市民體育，智育方面着想，於各公園分別佈置動物園，運動塲，釣魚台，兒童樂園，音樂台，花壇等，俾市民不但籍資調節身心，兼可為增進智識之助。</p>
<p>檢驗工作之設施</p>
<p>本局檢驗室工作之範圍，約分三類：曰糞水之分析與煉淸，曰柏油路材料之配製，曰建築材料及燃料之試騐與化騐也。關　於本市糞水分析與煉淸之工作，因各區房屋，大都裝置水廁，由水廁抽出之糞水，含有無數之傳染病細菌，本局特設東西北三廠，用最新式，最有效，最經濟之煉淸法，將傳染病細菌與污水分離，然後將淸水導入江河，其煉成之污泥，成分有淡質百分之三至百分之六，　質百分之一·五、至百分之二·五，實良好之肥田料也。</p>
<p>關於柏油路材料之配製，本局設有柏油廠柏汕化騐室，配置柏油路材料，法分熱法與冷法兩種，最優良者為熱法製造，惟配製方法頗繁，且須用煤及煤油等燃料，値茲燃料缺乏之時，此法已不適用，故對於冷法製造柏油砂之硏究，近頃不造餘力。經用冷法製造之出品，成績甚佳，而製造時毋須煤油等燃料，僅用舊柏油砂加以少量之礦油而巳。</p>
<p>至於建築材料及燃料之試騐室與化騐室數處，各室裝置電力試騐機，氣壓機，水泥試騐機，及各種化騐機械，試騐各種工程上應用之材料，與汽車鍋爐燃料，除供給本局種種試騐外，　代試騐外界送來之樣品焉。</p>
<p>水電加價之措施</p>
<p>關於本市電燈，煤氣，自來水，電話，電車，公共汽車等各項公共事業，除前八區部份係法商電燈電車公司所經營外，其餘均屬中日合辦公司業務範圍，市民對於上項公用設施之一再滅量與加價，頗表不滿，在市諮詢委員會席上，亦曾提出是項問題，本局平亦認為此種情形，影響市民生活，增加市民負擔，責職所在，不能不加以整　，故已呈由市府轉請建設部確定本局管理與監督之職權在尚未接奉覆令以前，本局業已分別向有關各公司密切連　。（完）</p>
<h3>解救食糧問題</h3>
<p>其一　胡采卷</p>
<p>目前的食糧問題，巳臨到了最嚴重的關頭。關於如何調劑民食，抑平物價。申報社評已一再論及，語多警惕，透澈之至。以及項康原先生的「解決食糧恐慌芻議」，羅漢先生的「不可忽視的救饑對策」，均是針對現實，大聲疾呼。我相信，許多的讀者，對此自然是寄以無限的同情和欽佩！</p>
<p>但是僅僅是同情和欽佩，對於實際情形又有什麼帮助呢？雖然處決之權首在市政當局，但我們做老百姓的的　腹將在旦夕，維持最低的生命需要都不可能的時候，應該破除向來緘默的習慣，貢獻意見予市政當局，使市政當局可以知曉現在確巳是大部份民衆陷於水深火熱的程度了，或者可以積極一點，進行折衝，以蘇民困。上海是目為文化的都市，尤其是戰後的文化人都薈集到上海，但是他們的任務呢，在這種時候，雜道怕啓齒為難嗎？我希望許許多多的文化人以及社會有識之士，不一定要新聞從業負才有責任，大家熱心一點，貢獻意見，及對於採辦食糧方面有專門經驗的人才，自動貢獻意見，及表示顧為市府效力，則市政當局於市民一致殷切請求下，自能接受多數人的意見，而一一付諸實施，則民生安全，戰力自强，大東亞戰爭勝利可待。</p>
<p>我是一個家族主婦而兼有六個孩子的母親，茲代表多數民衆的願望，貢獻意見數則：</p>
<p>從速恢復戶口配給制　戶口配給自去年秋季以來幾形中斷，食糧方面，米則從未配過一次，麵粉僅配過四次，日用品方面火柴肥皂約各配過二次。時至今日，食米黑市已超過五十大關，倘能恢復食糧鄭給，無論米·麵·雜糧祗要持之恒，則囤米者自能將貨出籠傾銷市上，人心因配給制度的恢復而安定，無須終日惶惶，求諸黑市，則米價日能下跌。一般物價富能隨之下流，趨於平定。</p>
<p>改善平價米分給制　平價米之本意，原為令各公會轉交各業會員，作為分發各低薪職工之用，但其結果各業會員即各工廠·行·號等，於領到平價米之後，即以此平價米作為一切職工膳食之用，並不分發與低薪之職工，此無異替開店老闆省下一筆職員膳食費用。但市府當局於極艱難情形下得來之米，何必如此消耗呢，所以今後的平價配給必須大加改革，凡一切公會之重點配給槪須取締，而將此省下之大宗食米併入戶口米配給項下，按期配給，則一切低薪職工由戶口米之配給而得到實惠，民間困苦可解除不少。</p>
<p>縱速嚴查囤積物資，予以收買處罰　上海的物價飛漲，大半康因因囤戶囤積揉縱所致，當局雖曾三令五申，但未見實效，應如何斷然處置，以防止事態之嚴重性，而解民衆倒懸之苦。</p>
<p>上述三點，雖未詳盡，倘能一一實行，則物價漲風，指日可戰，市民不勝馨香祝　之至。</p>
<p>其二　邦柱</p>
<p>本市近日各物，又作週期上漲，尤以食米為甚，若長此以往，不及早設法遏止，貧民生活、何堪設想。茲略述管見如下：</p>
<p>（甲）疏通來源　此點雖為老生常談，然迄未實現，深為遺憾。而常聞途中軍警非法留難，亦來源不暢之主因。此地方官用人失　難辭其咎，極盼設法　頓，以整紀律，俾使貨物得流通，成本減輕，貨價自然團降。</p>
<p>（乙）取締投機　此次突然漲價，雖係產米區成本提高，然句日間決無漲起兩倍之鉅，其中難免有不肖商人，從中作崇，散佈謠言，坐收漁利。此華唯知利己，罔顧大公，殊甚痛恨，投機如不取締，非但食米一項，無回小之日，即其他各貨，亦恐難平。欲消滅投機，愚意一面派員密查，一面着各戶如有發現投機者，即當檢舉，此市有關本身利害，諒樂為之。一經查出，嚴懲不貨，况周市民上任時，曾於吿市民書中云：「處亂世，用重典」，如此投機或能絕跡，可使人民生活少受威脅。</p>
<p>（丙）早發配給米　今日市民所食之米，因戶口米配給無望，大多依賴黑市調劑，此亦黑市米猖獗之主因，不悉物品配給處何故無聲無息，徒使市民望穿秋水，當務之急，速宜設法早日配給，以解民困，以後不再脫期，使市民不需黑市調劑，黑市當無從猖獗。</p>
<p>以上數點尙希當局予以採納，則市民幸甚！</p>
<h3>急待修繕的全市太平龍頭</h3>
<p>— 朱明良</p>
<p>明本月十六日報載餘姚大火記詳云：「餘姚路上的四個太平龍頭因年久失修，一滴水也弄不出，找來找去，最後方在金司徒廟康定路一一七一號門前，尋到一個太平龍頭，可是皮帶又不修長，於是又忙着皮帶，等各區預備的皮帶送一以，時間已躭誤了好久。」最後終於火勢蔓延，無法收拾，故災區之廣，為近年來所未有。由上國之，實太平龍頭修之果也。謹就愚見所及，略述於後，免蹈覆轍，希望市政當局，予以硏究採納為幸。</p>
<p>連飭令消防處從速檢騐太平龍頭有無捐　失修之處，若有，則應迅速派員加以修繕。</p>
<p>若消防處未及檢騐或通令各保甲檢查，各該保內若有捐壞失修之太平龍頭，則須報吿消防處待派員修理，或在可能範圍內逕自出資加以修理之。</p>
<p>各區消防處，應自備有相距二太平龍頭間之距離長的皮帶若干條，以防萬一，設若一太平龍頭損壞，則亦無多大妨害。</p>
<p>若照上列三條全面實施，則今後一旦遇有空襲或火災，則亦不無小補吧？</p>

<h3>鐲</h3>
<p>— 侯千里</p>
<p>何太太一想到那一隻金鐲，心裏就直是難過。</p>
<p>可不是？那隻金鐲曾陪伴了她嫁後二十載的光陰，那些夢似的悠長的歲月，也更陪伴了無數的眼淚，除了女兒以外，裏隻鐲該是她丈夫死後十幾年來最親近的伴侶了。</p>
<p>早先，那隻鐲也有它的同伴，陪嫁過來的時候，那一對鐲被用非常精緻的盒子裝着，用紅綠的絲綫紥着，當母親親手拆開來套上女兒的雙手的時候，當金鐲閃閃地炫耀着人們眼睛的時候，它——和它的主人可會想到今天？</p>
<p>嫁後不到五年，丈夫死了，在極度的經濟困難下，何太太非常痛心地毀了一隻鐲，用那隻鐲去抵付一切的開支，打發那些　戶們猙獰的面孔，她曾是多痛心地毀掉那一隻鐲呵！</p>
<p>從此，一雙只剩了一隻，何太太說過：</p>
<p>「那一隻鐲無論如何不能再毀了，就是啃樹皮，我也得留着。」　　她保留住那剩下的一隻鐲，但是却變賣了其他的嫁妝，丈夫死後，鄕下那幾畝田照說雖也足夠她們母女倆生活，可是這年頭，有田地的人就只有望着田地嘆氣，她不得不一件一件地拿當初陪嫁過來的傢俱往家裏一搬出去，到需要的數目大的時候，也只有忍心地從那些有限的首飾中揀出一兩件來。</p>
<p>只是那一隻失了同伴的金鐲永遠被一張紅紙包着。</p>
<p>「就是啃樹皮，我也得留着。」</p>
<p>每一次打開小手提箱翻動着的時候，每一次何太太這樣想。</p>
<p>她當然該留着，——不是為了自己。何太太還有女兒，她底全部的希望，都放在那個年靑的女兒身上中，為了女兒，她才活着。</p>
<p>「阿涓。」她不止一次地向女兒說：「我這世是再沒別的指望了，你爹沒留什麼給我，可是，我，我不能再不顧到你，我借債也得讓你唸書，將來爭口氣。」</p>
<p>「我們見張伯伯那裏有五萬了嗎？」女兒驚然想到地問。</p>
<p>「前前後後一共是四萬八千六百塊，還不知道拿什麼去還。」母親沉痛地說：「也幸而是張伯伯看着你過世的爹面上，不然，誰廿幾次三番地讓你麻煩？你看，別人家就兩樣了，跟他們通融一點就像什麼似的。」</p>
<p>「媽！」阿涓試探地：「我去找個事做做吧，學校也沒唸頭，學費這麼費，借債上學，何必？而且，也可以有一點收入。……」</p>
<p>「這年頭有什麼地主有事做？而且，唸書總是好的，唸了書還怕找不到事？再說，唸也唸到高中快畢業了，何必還差一年就要緊找事做？我們也還沒到實在付不出學費的地步。」</p>
<p>有幾個同學開了一隻小學，我可以去敎的。」</p>
<p>「為什麼不等畢業了再講呢？辛辛苦苦十幾年，好容易巴到高中華業，我不能讓你將來抱怨。抱怨做娘的沒給你好好唸書。」</p>
<p>對於這位太太的固執眞該原諒，她含辛茹苦地將女兒帶大，讓她唸書，她把自己所有的希望都放在女兒身上。再說，她寗可啃樹皮也要留下那隻鐲是為什麼來着？難道她自己還想戴？何太太也一直在想像着，有那麼一天，她也親手拆開一隻精緻的用紅綠線紥着的盒子，拿一雙鐲套在女兒的手上。讓那隻鐲在許多人面前閃閃地發光。</p>
<p>她就留着這隻鐲到那時候，再凑些錢，打成一付。</p>
<p>然而，屋子裏漸漸空起來，何太太再沒法用傢具去變換些米，柴米可不去管它，為了女兒，為了那一點希望，就是眞的啃樹皮何太太也的確能做的，麻煩的是另外一件事。</p>
<p>阿涓的留額費！</p>
<p>阿涓本來是在申請一家報館的助學金的，不夠的數目總是再向別如凑凑。可是這回相差的數目可眞大，學校裏限定，五月底以前不繳留額費就沒有學額，這就是說，五月底以前，何太太還得再付兩萬塊錢。</p>
<p>何太太想去跟校長商量，遲一些時候繳，可是女兒勸她不必做那種沒有效果的事。到一些親友家去，沒開口，人家就先訴窮，似乎老天爺有意拿窮人都凑到一堆似的。何太太當然不好意思再向人家通融，何况她還欠着人家的。</p>
<p>「我我去找個事做吧！不上學了。」女兒狠心地說。</p>
<p>「不能！萬萬不能！只差一年，還轉什麼心思！」何太太斬釘截鐵地。</p>
<p>可是幾天之內，是得拿出兩萬塊錢。而且，幾天以內，還要買二三斗米，還得有些人來跟她淸帳。—例如裁縫，二房東之類，意思說，這幾天裏，她必須忙出幾十萬塊錢來</p>
<p>女兒出去想法子去了。何太太坐在那間空空的屋子裏，對着女兒那一堆書嘆氣。</p>
<p>房東太太進來了，沒提到房錢，先就嚷着：</p>
<p>「何太太！你知道今天金子啥價錢？一百萬了！」</p>
<p>何太太陪着她搖搖頭。表示這年頭眞不得了。</p>
<p>「所以我說」，房東太太說：「這年頭要是誰有一兩二兩金子，就發了財。我要是有那末一點金子，哼！不滿你何太太說……」</p>
<p>何太太突然想起那隻鐲。</p>
<p>十五年前毀掉第一隻鐲的時候，她記得店家吿訴她，那隻鐲有六錢金子，剩下的那隻當然也一樣，那麼，就得有六十萬！</p>
<p>六十萬！這可什末都不成問題，女兒的學費，……她都有法子應付，那一隻就什麼都夠了。</p>
<p>可是，她忍心再毀掉那最後的一點僅有的財產麼？</p>
<p>那隻鐲，陪了她二十年，她原想讓它再陪女兒到老的，她曾經說即使啃樹皮也要留着的，如今一，她能毀掉？</p>
<p>她打算跟女兒再商量一下。</p>
<p>女兒一進門就吿訴母親在路上碰見了一個同學，據說只有她一個人沒繳留額費了，要是明天不繳，留額費下學期就別來唸書，因此，她打算去跟學校裏說就不去唸了……</p>
<p>「不，我繳！」何太太急促地打斷女兒的話，在這一瞬間她决定了一切：「我明天就去繳，你不要去說。」</p>
<p>「錢呢？」女兒奇怪着母親的激動的情緒。</p>
<p>「我去毀了那隻鐲。」何太太沉重地說。</p>
<p>女兒沒响，母女倆的眼眶裏都滿是淚水。</p>
<p>晚上，何太太和阿涓鄭重地從手提箱裏拿出那個紅紙包，何太太用顫抖着的手撫摹着，撫摹着。女兒低着頭站在桌子旁邊</p>
<p>「阿涓，你將來有了錢自己再打一付吧。」何太太低低地說：「眞沒想到連最後一點東西也還留不住。」</p>
<p>她覺得眞沒法再顧到將來了，將來，誰曉得是什銷樣子。只是她感到對不起女兒，連那末一隻留了十幾年的金鐲也還是不能夠給她留下。然而，想到這是女兒的留額費和學費的時候，何太太又覺得安心了，她也還算沒對不起自己底女兒！</p>
<p>「這也算是為她用的。」她想：「我總算讓她高中唸畢業。」</p>
<p>走出那　銀樓的時候，何太太像同時也失落了一顆心。</p>
<h3>浪花</h3>
<p>— 黃沙</p>
<p>沒有歡歌，喉嚨似巳閉塞，情願用沉默來埋葬自己的熱情。</p>
<p>沒有嘻笑，天眞似巳斷絕，情願用恨惘來塡補自己的胸　。</p>
<p>沒有希望，憧憬亦不過是一幕偽造的影子，倒不如沒有一切存在，　自己沉浸在無為中。</p>
<p>沒有天地，祗有太狹太黑的一綫空間是自己的！世界這樣廣闊，為什麼竟把自己跌陷在這深沉的泥淵中？</p>
<p>打不破的憂煩；解不開的愁結；這時代的躍動，却仍沒有把自己的照液給沸騰了；情願冰凍在悲哀的怨咒裏，把原來的美麗的夢撕了。</p>
<p>不要　情，不要空暇，這也許祗能被孤寂呑唾了自己的血淚！</p>
<p>不要柔情，不要輕信，這許祗是痛苦的泉涌，祗是情感的浪擲，靑春的耗蝕。</p>
<p>靑年的人，却有了暮年的心。再不着慕別人的幸福，再不妒忌別人的成功，自己祗是自己的一切，一切祗靠自己的手和自己的脚，再加上自己的理智，却不要那童稚的熱情。</p>
<p>要學得老成些，要鑄鍊得堅强些，要看得現實些，要脚踏實地的去做，要緊張熱烈，要忙碌奔波，要健康，要倔强。</p>
<p>靑年的路，究竟不同於老年的，亦不同於少年的，究竟是這時代最有力量的一條路，走着走着，像自己所把握的走罷。</p>
<p>不會孤獨，不會迷途，不會沉瀹，因為—</p>
<p>祗憑自己這種勇氣，深深相信，許多這時代的有志的靑年，都是伙伴，雖是不相識的伙伴。却是同路的伙伴。</p>
<p>是不是呢，誠摯的友人。　說一說罷！</p>
<h3>我與社會</h3>
<p>— 吳昆銘</p>
<p>走出了學校的大門，我開始踏進了社會。</p>
<p>踏進了社會的第一步當然是找尋職業。憑着我敬業樂業的性情與精神，我想一定能得到一個理想的位置。</p>
<p>於是我忙碌了，天天在社會裏奔走，為了我自己的新生。</p>
<p>本公司擬聘職員數人，須刻苦耐勞，無惡劣嗜好，供膳宿外，月給薪金甚豐，有意者請書明詳細履歷，並附本人最近半身照片兩張，函寄本報信箱第××號，合則專函奉達的約期面談，不合者原件退還。××公司啓</p>
<p>把這廣告連連看了幾遍，我細細咀嚼每一句句子。我覺得這是一個絕好機會來了，我沒有惡劣的嗜好，能刻苦，而且「供膳宿外，月給薪金甚豐。」這樣的待遇也不能算壞。</p>
<p>我坐在書桌前，拿起了小楷筆，毫不思索地寫了一封售；信上每一都是細心地寫着，我寫好信封，把照片附在裏面，然後小心將封口封妥，貼上郵票，整整費了一個鐘頭。我把全部的希望都寄託在這封信裏。</p>
<p>懷着滿腔的熱情，親自把信投入郵筒。然後在家靜心等着；天天注意幾個綠衣使者。一星期過去了，沒有回信，十天過去了，沒有，半個月過去了，仍舊沒有，我開始懷欵起來，我想這封信一定是寫錯了信箱號碼或是郵局把它遺失了。</p>
<p>焦燥地又過了一個月，終究音息全無，猶如石沉大海，看看沒有希望了，我才死了這條心。可是某一個下午，偶然在友人底間談裏　，我才明白了這件事的眞相，原來那個公司在發廣吿之前早巳有了職員，　而那批職員都是公司裏所謂重要人物底朋友或親戚，報上所登的廣吿祗不過是表面上的一種手續而已，實際郤把一羣沒有職業的「有意者」底信全部棄之不問。</p>
<p>明白了赤赤裸裸的「事實」，我眞佩服他們底聰明。我沒有怨懣，我沒有懊喪，我祗有恨，恨這欺人的社會。</p>
<p>我終於找到職業了，是在一個貿易公司，職務是記帳。</p>
<p>任職的第一天，我愉快地懷着一顆誠摯的心去服務。我勉勵自己，安慰自己。我小心地坐在椅上，小心地握住了筆，小心地記着每一筆數目，我把我底精神和熱望都支付在這事業上。</p>
<p>每日早出晚歸，生活很有紀律，娛樂與工作也很適當，而且在日常職務上又使我增進了許多寶貴的知識。</p>
<p>可是，事情來了。某一天，公司裏進了八十萬的一宗貨物，我拿着單子正想記上帳去的時候，忽然經理特地跑到我寫字　旁，帶着笑低聲關照我在帳上現金的一項寫上一百萬，我聽了他那「客氣的吩咐」後，馬上立起來反對，我說這明明是八十萬，怎麼可以加上二十萬，並且單子上也是寫着這個，假使在帳上變了數目，這不是和事實不符合了嗎？將來查起帳來是誰底責任呢？可是我這些話無補於事，他堅持地要我寫上一百萬，我和他爭論了半天，責任心和正議感使和下了結論：我沒有理由這麼做！所以我不能這麼做。於是，事情弄僵了。最後，他老羞成怒，把桌子一拍叫我立刻滾蛋，我是個爽直的人，不能就這麼屈服，我咬緊了牙齒，恨恨地揭穿了他用意的秘密，我又大大地敎訓她一頓，我毀了他底尊嚴，撕了他的假面具，然後，我大踏步地離開了那個貿易公司。</p>
<p>在歸途上，我覺得又恨又痛快，痛快的是我那麼大膽地敎訓了一個經理，恨的是這社會的虛偽與卑鄙。</p>
<p>經過了兩重波折後，我非但不因失業而消沉，反而使我增加了許多對不合理事挑戰的勇氣，而對社會也有更進一步的認識了。</p>
<p>又在一個極巧的機緣下，我進了一家銀行。我千萬沒有想到我居然會做起這號稱「金飯碗」的職業了。</p>
<p>每天在算盤，票據，帳簿，現鈔裏旋轉，但我並不嫌累，相反的我很愉快，因為在這裏畢竟安定了我底生活。</p>
<p>平靜地過了一年，在這一年中，我度過了幾個所謂「一年一度」的住節，每一年個佳節，同事們都忙着買應時的東西，我曾好奇地問他們是為了什麼，他們一齊露出了詫異而尷尬的面容對我說：「沒有辦法！送禮啊」我不免一怔，暗忖：難道送禮是一件「沒有辦法」的往來嗎？可是事實明明白白地呈現在我面前，為了飯碗，為了前途，為了博取上司底歡心，是的，沒有辦法，不得不送禮。</p>
<p>但，例外的，我在佳節上並沒有送禮，我倔强的本性禁止做道「我沒辦法」的事，我倒要試試看到底有什麼結果。</p>
<p>第二年開始了，當然最先來的是元旦，行中照例有一番更動：裁的裁，升的升，調的調。我在假期中的第三天便接到了從行中發出的信，拆開來一看，果然，不出我所料，行中因「節省開支」的原因把我裁了。哈！前後不滿十三個月！</p>
<p>撕碎了信紙，我沒有別的感覺，我祗有恨！恨這勢利的社會。</p>
<p>社會　遍地黃金的社會，社會是美麗的嗎？我不能說，我祇有嘆息。</p>
<p>到處充滿了欺騙，虛偽，卑鄙，黑暗。社會沒有我立足的地方；沒有一個年輕忠實有才學有血性的「不識時務」的　子立足的地方。</p>
<p>我恨透了這個自私自利的社會，我得不到同情與帮助，所受到的祗是一連串譏諷輕視的冷笑。像一個荒漠中的孤獨的旅人，四周給我的祗是一片使我失望的大沙漠。</p>
<p>可是，我是倔强的！</p>
<p>我沒有絕望，我更沒有頹喪，我還有一雙堅强的手臂，我還有一個壯健的軀體，我還有一條反抗的靈魂。讓過去的陰影死去，我雖然失敗，但，我還是同社會在決戰，看究竟是誰片服了誰？我就這麼倔强地活着，活着來翻開我生活的新的一頁。</p>
<h3>更聲</h3>
<p>— 知行</p>
<p>子夜，無邊的黝黑，在廣漠的沉默裏，小巷口動蕩着一片凄冷的更聲，疏零地，彷彿是荒郊古剎中的幽鐘，在鼓擊後散播着動人心弦的音波。</p>
<p>在這冷寂的子夜，我們需求着更聲，牠使我們知道，在這漫漫的黑暗中，也還有守更人的一盞寒燈，並且更聲盡處，即將是失眼人渴望着的黎明。</p>
<h3>騙</h3>
<p>— 我川</p>
<p>春天到了。算算看，林巳離開了我三個年頭。</p>
<p>我記得，那時候林李和我，因了性格的相投契，成為了最好的同學。</p>
<p>李有着富足的家，是個溫柔天眞的　子。林，自小就顠泊在外，削疲的臉上似抹着一層凄冷的風　，然而他年紀却比李小。</p>
<p>每當放學後或者是假日，李總時常邀我們到他家裏去玩。我却有着一種癖性，就是到有錢的人家裏去。總會感到異樣的不安，所以便不大如約；但林却和我相反，也許是經年的流浪使他想到有家的幸福，何况李家又是那末溫暖呢？這樣，林和李更更景親密起來。</p>
<p>有時在黃昏的燈下，小巧精緻的室內，關閉着一襲溫暖，我們三個人促膝坐着，那隨意的談咦就油然迸發出來。這談笑直繼續到深夜，我才高興地走回家，而林就往往被留着過夜了。</p>
<p>但林是個略具孤傲，不願受到冷面相待的人，在有一兩次發現李家的人似乎討厭他之後，他便不高興再答應李的要李過夜的請求。而為了他屢次的拒絕，李的內心便常感到莫名的失望與惘悵。</p>
<p>林受李家人討厭的原因，大槪是由於他的漸趨窮困吧！他的面色更顯蒼黃，衣服也　　起來。李看到他這樣，便時常動濟他，但他却很少接受。更開始意識到自己所處的階層絕不同於李，雖然還和李守着良好的友誼，可是已沒有從前那樣執着，那樣的熱烈，他變得更鬰鬰寡歡，悄然自傷了。</p>
<p>寒假的前日，李請林和我到他家裏去，似有惜別之意，但林還是鎖着他那雙濃眉，兩眼無神地看着我們，好像有着無限的心思要想吐給我們聽，然而又終於一字未說，終於很早就走了。</p>
<p>寒假裏他沒有來看我們，我們到他家裏去，却住了些另外的人，原來他們已經搬了家。</p>
<p>開了學，林便沒有再來。後來接到他的一封信，不過寥寥數字，只吿訴我們，他今天失了學。</p>
<p>三人中少了一個，日子就過得寂寞些，尤其是李，竟一改他那天眞無憂的習性，喪氣了多時。我安慰他，說林不久一定會來看我們，他却肯定地說：「林是一個極固執的人，當他愛你的時候，他便把全心愛着你；當他恨你的時候，他便把全心恨着你。」我說：「他絕不會恨我們。」李說：「看着吧。」</p>
<p>然而出於李的意外的是，林居然在一個春天的假日到他家裏來了。</p>
<p>他的眼裏充滿着紅絲，觀骨高起，險上蒙着靑黑色的生活的陰影。他穿着沾有油污的藍色工裝，臂上裹着塊黑布。</p>
<p>「上個月我的父親死了，我不能忘掉他那死時熱望着我的眼睛，意思在囑咐我，從此要好好地負起家族的担子來：現在我做了工，拿一點可憐的工錢養活一家子，我再也不會有你們這樣讀書的一日了！」</p>
<p>為了不願使他傷心，我們都愉快歡迎着他。留他住宿，這一次他也很爽直的答應了。</p>
<p>李很誠懇的問他需不需用點錢，說小的數目絕對可以不成問題。林只是堅決地搖着頭。這樣，李索性拿出了些來　在他的衣袋裏，一面說：「假如你還承認我是你的要好的朋友，你應該接受了下來。」</p>
<p>他快速且微怒地擲還了李，用着自尊的口吻道：</p>
<p>「我沒有現由可以接受你的錢。我承認你是我最好的朋友，但是我們有着一層無形的　膜，這層隔膜決不是用這方法可以去除的。」</p>
<p>當夜，林和我都留宿在李的臥室裏。</p>
<p>然而奇怪的是自那天後，李對我的態度忽然改變了。他漸漸疏淡於我，側目於我，並且時在暗中窺探於我。這情形持續了有個把月，我實在忍不住了，有一天便鄭重地問他。「有什麼懷疑我的地方嗎？請你直接對我說了吧！」</p>
<p>他裝作驚奇的看看我，而後否認了。</p>
<p>我無從知道他懷欵我的原因，我苦苦地自省着，却仍然一無所得。最後，我想：我為什麼要一定和你和好呢？你旣猜忌着我，我們就索性分開了吧。於是我們漸成為不要好的朋友了。但是，有一天，李忽然跑來把一封信遞給我，喘着氣說：「你看，你看！林居然會這樣！……」接着又用求恕的聲音對我：「請你原諒我的過去吧。」</p>
<p>我急忙展開林的信，上面是這樣寫着：——</p>
<p>「……我是個最大的騙子！我騙了最信任我的朋友，也騙了我的良心！我的良心天天逼着我，我不得不把這事吿訴了你，那是：就在那重逢的一夜，我偷了你的錢和戒指。這當兒你會不會驚得發呆？是的，你絕不會想到這事情是我幹的，因為你一直就把最大的信任給了我！我能用什麼話來掩飾我的醜態呢？不能！我只能對你說一句我受了「傲骨」的害！那一晚你拿錢給我，我何嘗不需要它呢？難道我忍心看我媽和弟妹們在餓着壯皮向我哭訴嗎？然而，我看不起錢，我更看不起以金錢來代表的友情，因此我拒絕了你。可是想到將來的生活，那枷鎖着囚在地獄裏的生活，我又重新懂得了金錢的威力！但我旣巳拒絕了你，我怎能再向你開口？後來我想起你放在枕頭下的手錶和戒指，我便糊塗地摸着塞在自己的口袋裏了！……這件事將使我痛苦一生，僅僅懺悔有什嚴麼用呢？我不能請求你的寬恕，只望你在將來長長的時日裏永遠忘了我吧！……」</p>
<p>哦，原來如此！怪不得李那些天當中是那末懷欵着我呢？</p>
<p>這是個烙印，深深地刻在林底，純潔的　露上</p>
<p>事實使我懂得了：在這不平的社會裏，處於不同地位的人之間，是有着絕不可互解的地方的，即使他們是最要好的朋友。</p>
<p>我仍舊珍貴着他過去所賜於我的友情；但自此以後，我便失去了他。</p>
<p>是第三年的春天了，春風會給我帶來他底新消息嗎？</p>

<p>足聯會主辦之需募教育基金第二次足球義賽，將於明日在跑馬廳球塲舉行，由白馬僑聯二度會師。查上述兩隊於第八次福利賽時會面。以兩隊之球藝超羣，曾造成熱烈情况。此番兩隊見義勇偽，爲教育基金而戰，殊堪稱道。吸引力之大，固在意料之中，教育基金之得惠，　淺鮮哉！</p>
<p>白馬隊借兵抱比勝决心</p>
<p>查白馬隊最近因孫錦順之離滬，李垚之受傷，自爾影嚮實力。但該朦主幹程伯庵君有抱必勝之決心，故復借用聯該之吳祺祥瞿永福羅壽福，是則得失之問，相差尚微，屆時必能有理想之收穫也。</p>
<p>白馬隊旣邀得聯誼將士後，尚以左翼人選之缺乏，故對於陣容之如何支配，頗值得研究。筆者個人意見，可得其二：</p>
<p>白馬第一陣容</p>
<p>張　莊友仁　永福李養臣</p>
<p>邦　　福　戴　輕</p>
<p>綸　張林根宋聖韓龍海</p>
<p>上擬陣容，允爲攻守兼顧。藎自前鋒缺阿孫李垚後，總有難以完整之憾。就技術而言，將非李義臣吳祺祥莫屬。因僑聯門將之球藝不凡，身手矯健。除脚頭之外，兼須有經騐，智力並施，及具衞刺之能力始可，則李義臣有出脚極快極刁極强硬之脚頭。吳祺祥過去屢作翼位，其衝刺力量及斜角打門，均有精湛之演出，當不致令人失望也。中衛綫之支配，允稱理想。宋。鐔。瞿。無不佳。後衛方面，不能不以林根退後。好在友仁近况尚好，老搭檔自無多大錯誤。更以中衛綫之强盛，可收事半功倍之效。守門張邦綸之身手，始終有顯著成績，勝任愉快，應無異議。</p>
<p>白馬第二陣容張　吳祥　永福字義臣邦　　福　戴　輕倫　張林根宋靈聖韓龍海</p>
<p>買幼良</p>
<p>以上擬定之陣錢，所用祺祥爲後衛者，爲合乎其本人最近之位置。一旦調動，或有不逮，免作嘗試，仍踢原位，得以發揮其　峯之成績。而後防亦稱無暇可擊矣，左翼一職，無可如何中，唯有用小將羅壽福。按羅踢內鋒，頗有可取，一度曾試左翼，格格不入，不識邇來可稍如人意否？</p>
<p>總論上鎖　兩陣容果屬面面顯到。但前鋒線其最大之缺點，即前鋒線上，獲球未使無望，實力亦算充沛。而難望如東華五前鋒合作默契，鏡頭必將較遜一籌矣。</p>
<h3>戰術研討</h3>
<p>現爲冀望白馬之再度凱旋，略作戰極之研討。</p>
<p>夫僑聯之陣容及應用方法，似已有固定，是則白馬應有事前之計劃業。</p>
<p>先談守，白馬布論用任何練容，左前　及左後衛兩人之間，應相互有一暗示，作阻遇對方右鋒及右翼之策。蓋僑聯進攻出發點，必以鮑傑維拉爲主，決換變方式之作風。故左邊守門，應死　，態切斷，其二人之迎繫，進而阻止其個人活躍力，庶可得矣。次之，對方泰克尼之中鋒，頗具衝鋒陷城之能事。唯老　不　不懈，恐泰克尼將無路可入。僑聯左鋒左翼在混亂中，有時以巴瑪爲內鋒，迪盤那杜爲翼，盛亞托馬利爲左翼，固皆屬老手。但作調換，彼此均無專長之發展，情况亦在正常之下，可無多大威脅。守衛方法最須注意者，達住球門區城以內之佈防，萬不可　懈。否則番將舊作冷箭之施，豈客忽視。</p>
<p>若談進攻之途，記者屢謂僑聯之守衛，不論中衛綫及後衛，均陷於並行式之呆板方法中。隨球影而或前或後，此種方法幸其體力充沛，露出破綻尙少。否則，敵鋒進襲極易。破之之道，須多用短少傳遷，或作V字形及W字式之挺進，則彼必有顯前忘後之慮。更之，白馬有特殊之攻法，即利用龍海之猛竄，未必足以威脅其呆方法之後衛，即門將爲最難被克服者。又在龍海是時在左方之鋒及翼最應注意站立攻門最佳之地位。宜用龍海軍之掩護，幼良軍機挑左，坐攻打門機會，如此則僑聯將一無辦法對對付矣。</p>
<p>時序已入初夏，足球本非所宜。但足聯當局爲善舉而作此精彩比賽之邀請，以及球員之冒暑比賽，皆爲我人值得欽佩者也</p>
<h3>聯誼振作　戰勝葡商</h3>
<p>在上星期日聯誼和葡商兩足球隊，作足聯會籌　教育基余的第一次比賽，因爲兩隊在聯賽甲組中有着一段小小的糾紛關係，所以號召力，便意外的好。可惜那天太陽晒得球迷們太苦，不識以後在上午的比賽，會提早舉行，或者移至下午麼？否則，我以爲有影響賣座的可能。</p>
<p>賽前大家多以爲這一塲球，彼此一定有很精彩的戰情，甚至有提高水準的演出，結果是失望了。簡單地說一句，聯誼似乎碰到了一庸弱隊伍那樣簡單地嬴了。話雖如此，聯誼一口氣總算洩了，可是很多神經過敏者，這也許是葡商隊員兩全的預定計劃，我不敢相信，也不希望是事實。現在且歸正文的評那一塲戰事。</p>
<p>不妨先查葡商演出不佳的　給點，那便是雖然用着搭配極好的健將，可是不照方法去做。譬如設，中堅奧列維拉戴得球，在當時情形，最好機會的是V　若。照平時他一定很快很純熟的遙傳過去，但是那天他却偏偏傳給爲人看守務的福恩，以致一切都完了。他們這樣的攻守，看來還是很努力，實則是一無所成了。</p>
<p>再看聯誼那天的表演，不論對方是用的什麼詭計，他們總是成功的。很明　的聯誼前鋒綫上李義臣。費春華。許文奎，都有生疏或者長力不繼的現象。但是這一役中，他們三人多有了很够得到的氣力。除了李義臣不免要發一點懶勁之外，當然要打進人家二隻球，亦不是偶然的事。尤其那天聯誼勝五六球，也極有可能性。</p>
<p>守的方面，因爲蔔商並沒有最好的進攻，所以就沒有多大勁道。然而各個人的脚頭淸爽，精神奕奕，俱顯出了聯誼的振作。久不見面，一向在被黜中的吳祺祥。他的雄姿，猛劇鏡頭，的確是够欣賞</p>
<p>對於聯誼隊的突起振作，爲愛護計，再進一言</p>
<p>查聯誼本屆在聯賽開始的初期，即擊退了虎視耽耽的僑聯，沒有一個國產球迷不起勁。因爲上屆聯誼太不行了。正是球迷們遙祝聲中，該隊發奮圖進，集中住宿按期練習。這樣情形，我們正期待着該隊的最後成功。不料以後數戰中，遭受了德商和滬警的和局。雖然勝敗兵家常事，事實上聯誼確實沒有做到人家所想像的成績。及至最後，與葡商决戰時，又造成了不歡而散，於是　都要　息着。同時也未聯誼前途擔憂。想不到在此季節己逝的辰光，該隊振其餘力，組織改進，努力球事，大有還我當年的氣槪。果然在這戰勝葡商的一場中，可以深信無疑，但是我不能不希望他們堅持到底，則其前途，決可在足球史上記下一筆，勉之！勉之！</p>
<h3>排球聯賽　甲女兩組形勢</h3>
<p>排球聯賽自開始角逐以來，已二星期。乙組以隊伍較多，良莠不齊，故一時尚少眉目。唯甲女兩組，第一循環已經完畢，今馴開始第二循環之大戰，爲奪錦標爭名位，必有更緊張之局面也。茲述甲女組之形勢，併作第二循環之盛望，先述甲組。</p>
<p>甲組</p>
<p>本屆聯賽，中北之穩得甲組冠軍，筆者早述於上期本刋。觀其在第一循環中，首戰取三省，網克華嚴，再勝白隊，未曾費多大氣力。則第二循環時，一帆風順，將無問題。致亞軍一席，照目下情形，三省態佔大份。唯白隊第一循環，竟至全軍覆沒，但以其實力而言，不致如此悽慘。第二循環必可有意外佳構。如白隊而能運勝三省華嚴，則形勢當起變化。華嚴在首職白隊時，因得番將谷坦戈及喬奇之助陣，取得勝利後，與中北戰得，僅到需奇一人，即見實力銳減，及至與三省對壘日，番將俱未到，更覺難敵人家。故第二循環時，如無番將助陣，恐非白隊之敵，如是則特軍一席，大致白隊與華嚴，爲最可能。</p>
<p>女組　　女子因隊伍太少，三省此中老手，綿標穩得。第一循環之先後擊退新本華嚴，吹灰之力，二場均　有威力未得發推。第二循環中，新本華嚴定能有較佳之成績，則三省除聲勝外，或可稍有威脅，使該隊有較多之發揮也。</p>
<p>女組名次之爭，亦唯在第二循環中，新本與華嚴之一戰耳。以理度之，新本旣能取勝，再逢時抱一彼乃我手下敗將」之心而赴，穩　穩打，自可直　黃龍，爭得第二名也。者，爲三排二角應略帶勇敢作風，無　疑之必要。而二排中王務醴，應略退後，多搶後方之球，寗使其互搶不失，不應使其相讓而失。能如此，勝華戰乃非難事矣。反之，爲華嚴着想，謀與新本同列第二，亦即並背黃包裏。更爲其係一有歷史之球隊，敗於一新興軍，亦應有復此一箭仇之必要。則華者希望該對老將如朱文佩張變月等均應出場，而對於調度位置，及指導之受機密，均有極重要之工作。如不然者，再見屈於新本爲馴想中事，而亦將背定本屆黃包裹矣。</p>
<h3>惠慶杯將展幕　各乒乓隊活躍狀況</h3>
<p>惠慶杯乒乓聯賽即將展幕，參加之各球隊，萬分活躍。茲將各隊現狀録下。</p>

<p>本屆籃球聯賽乙組總決，原定上月問可以全部結束。不料因總決初賽，飛馬與振源一役，發生糾紛後，迄無下文，誠今人莫解！蓋陣源提出抗議，如理由充足，則應准其重賽。尙爲其無理抗議，則應作飛馬勝利，照章與龍軍作複賽。而當局默默無聞，己逾旬日，從使各優隊望望眼欲穿也。（尋斗）</p>

        <h1>1945.06.09</h1>
<h3>Special Attack Corps Launch Attacks Day and Night, Fiercely Attacking Okinawan Fleets, Simultaneously Ramming Enemy Airfields, Inflicting Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Japan's Special Attack Corps from various bases enthusiastically launched attacks on the enemy fleet off Okinawa early on the 7th. Preliminary results include sinking one large warship. Continuous attacks occurred on the night of the 7th and the morning of the 8th, with further results expected.</p>
<p>Forward Aviation Base, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The newly formed "Shinbu" Special Attack Corps of the Japanese Air Force, to assist the intensifying ground battle in Okinawa, daringly penetrated enemy fleets around the main island on the night of the 6th under the direct protection of fighter planes, braving low atmospheric pressure, achieving anticipated results. The escorting fighters, although encountering enemy fighters, all returned safely.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, Eighth (Central News Agency) - As the ground battle on Okinawa intensifies, Japanese air units are descending from the Ryukyu Islands, engaging in fierce aerial combat with enemy defensive fighters. Coordinated with this, Japanese air units fiercely attacked enemy warships around the main island from the night of the 7th to before dawn on the 8th, and it is now confirmed that two enemy ships of unknown type were sunk. Another special unit rammed into an enemy airfield on the main island before dawn on the 8th, inflicting significant damage. Enemy aviation activity in the area is also gradually increasing, with the number of enemy aircraft attacking the island chain reaching over four hundred and several tens since the 7th.</p>
<h3>Southwest Naha Defensive Battles, Over 300 Enemy Soldiers Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>Okinawa Front Base, Eighth (Central News Agency) - In the land battle of Okinawa, the enemy forces, having broken through the Naha-Shuri line, are continuing their strong southward advance, launching offensives under the cover of enemy naval fleets and naval gun fire. The Japanese army is fiercely counterattacking. The current line of confrontation between the two armies is: on the west coast, from the southern end of Naha, upstream to the Kokuba River, then across a ridge about five kilometers south of Shuri, and then to the slopes of the Gushikawa area in the south of Chinen. The central battle line on the south bank of the Kokuba River has not changed significantly. The enemy is attempting to occupy the Oroku airfield, about two kilometers southwest of Naha. Since the morning of the 5th, a portion of the enemy force landed in the southwestern area of Naha, while another portion crossed the Kokuba River near Makabashi, south of Naha, reaching the side of the Oroku airfield, coordinating with the landing force. The Japanese garrison fought bravely, preventing the enemy's advance, and dispatched a large number of suicide attack squads to break into enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses. In the Oroku airfield battle alone, on the 5th and 6th, over 300 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. On the east coast, as of the evening of the 3rd, the enemy had advanced to the area from Ozato to Tomigusuku (five kilometers south of Yonabaru). Japanese units there are fighting fiercely to intercept them.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses of American Ships</p>
<p>Stockholm, Keijo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The excessive consumption of resources by the United States in the Okinawa campaign has drawn domestic attention. According to a report from New York, the New York Times editorial on June 5th stated that the Okinawa campaign has become an unprecedented battle in the Pacific. From the landing on April 1st to May 25th, the United States suffered 28,556 casualties on land and 9,369 at sea, totaling 37,925. This kind of loss is unseen since the Solomon Islands campaign. We can thus understand that Okinawa is the only defensive base ahead of the Japanese mainland and is much more valuable than any other island. Also, the neutral Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet, commented on the Pacific War and the heavy American losses on the 5th, stating that the losses suffered by the American forces in the campaign exceeded our expectations, especially the losses of ships and personnel. Furthermore, this campaign seems to have been delayed beyond the original plan, and the number of casualties suffered by the fleet participating in both land and sea battles surpasses the casualties of the army and navy by several months, indicating the intensity of the Japanese Special Attack Corps' continuous wave-like attacks on American warships. At the same time, American army and naval units are still engaged in extremely fierce struggles on land.</p>
<p>British Undersecretary Talks About War Against Japan</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports from a London broadcast that British Undersecretary Croft stated on the night of the 6th regarding the war against Japan that the war against Japan will be the third large-scale military operation in British history of victory. In terms of distance, it will be the longest-distance operation that Britain has ever seen. Japan's human resources, including all ethnic groups, total 90 million people, plus those who cooperate with Japan in China, Manchuria, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies, will reach 100 million. We will fight a desperate battle with a fanatical and courageous enemy fourteen thousand miles away.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Southern and Northern Kyushu Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Eight enemy B-29 aircraft intruded into the western coast of Yamaguchi Prefecture and northern Kyushu via the Bungo Channel at 00:00 on the 8th, dropping naval mines. Another plane, around 1:00, circled over the western sea of Fukuoka Prefecture via the northern coasts of Miyazaki and Saga Prefectures, laying naval mines.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Approximately two hundred enemy carrier-based aircraft, starting around 1:30 PM on the 8th, attacked southern Kyushu in formations of thirty to forty aircraft, strafing with machine guns near Fujiya and other Japanese bases, moving southward until about 1:40 PM. This enemy attack seemed to be an attempt to suppress the activities of the Japanese Special Attack Corps, but the Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Announced Yesterday Change in Speaker of the House</h3>
<p>Arriving in Kyoto, Eighth (Central News Agency) - After the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, Tsuneo Matsunaga, took office as Minister of Health and Welfare, his vacant position was decided to be filled by former Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Hiroo Shimada, and was announced by the cabinet on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Japan Does Not Recognize the Government of Tunisia, German Embassy and Consulates in Japan Closed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 8th. Prime Minister Suzuki and all cabinet members attended. At the meeting, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu explained the decision not to recognize the government of Tunisia and to close the German embassy and consulates in Japan. The meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Airstrike the Day Before Yesterday, City Areas Were Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Around 2:00 AM on the 6th, enemy American aircraft intruded into the city, circling over the jurisdiction of the Meng Sheng Sub-bureau, and then dropping more than a dozen heavy bombs on Dawangkou, Dongsaili, Erwangkou, Qianyi Street, Changrongli, and other places, destroying five houses. The rest fell in the wilderness. Five people were killed and four were injured in the attack.</p>
<h3>Huangdu and Anting Suburbs of the Towns and Villages Are to be Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Suzhou, Eighth (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that during the period of "Clearing the Countryside" held in this province in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), in order to facilitate the blockade, the former "Clearing the Countryside Committee" submitted a request to temporarily transfer the nine townships and villages including Huangdu and Anting of Jiading County, which were under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, to the jurisdiction of the Kunshan and Qingpu County Governments of this province, and now that the "Clearing the Countryside" work has been completed, it should also be returned at the same time. The eight points of implementation have been jointly decided, and in addition to informing the relevant bureaus and agencies and ordering the relevant county governments to comply with them, the handover procedures will be carried out on July 1st.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Police Department Temporarily Not to Be Merged</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Conference recently passed a resolution to strengthen the centralized power of provincial governors, planning to establish a secretariat and abolish the police department, and merge the police affairs into the civil affairs department, so as to make administrative efficiency more smooth and consistent. Zhejiang Province, located in the military front line, with important commercial affairs, especially the military and police should be closely linked, in order to ensure security, and the people can live and work in peace. The Zhejiang Provincial Police Department is actively expanding, and we must ensure the consolidation of defense, so the Zhejiang Police Department will continue to work and will not be merged for the time being.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Finance Department Adjusts Internal Organization</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, Eighth (Central News Agency) - In order to implement the intention of the provincial governor, to adapt to the wartime system, and to unify the financial system, the head of the Zhejiang Finance Department has decided to thoroughly reorganize the finances of Zhejiang Province, open up tax sources, and manage public funds. The organizational structure of the property will be reorganized. In addition to the first, second, and third sections of the secretariat remaining the same as usual, the original fifth section will be reorganized into the Special Consumption Tax Management Office, and the fourth section will be reorganized into the Accounting Office, which will implement an independent accounting system, specializing in financial receipts and expenditures.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Will Hold Election Representative Conference</h3>
<p>Suzhou, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Since the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department has been concurrently headed by the provincial governor, all work has been actively carried out, and the election representative conferences of the subordinate party departments at all levels launched in March have been completed one after another. In accordance with the order of the Central Government, the provincial election representative conference will be held this month, and the date has been decided. In addition to requesting the Central Government to send personnel to guide the election, the organization department is actively preparing for the birthday, and the work is intense.

The organization is sound.</p>
<h3>Hubei Province Improves Material Distribution System</h3>
<p>Hankou, Eighth (Central News Agency) - Hubei Governor Ye Peng, in view of the fact that in the past, the distribution of materials was mostly in the hands of individuals, and there were countless abuses, has now ordered the commanders at all levels to supervise their subordinates, and all material distribution must be managed and distributed by a committee organized by each unit, in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Source of Japan's Decisive Battle Strength</h3>
<p>The decisive battle of Okinawa Island is the prelude to the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland. On the one hand, the American enemy lost more than 560 ships for the landing operation on Okinawa Island before approaching the Japanese mainland, and also sacrificed more than 60,000 soldiers in the battle of citrus holdings on the island, so their combat plan could not but be delayed, and the morale of the entire army could not but be frustrated. On the other hand, because of the brave fighting of the Japanese garrison on Okinawa Island and the fierce attacks of the Air Special Attack Corps, the American enemy's so-called absolutely superior mobile units have repeatedly collapsed, and the landing force also felt difficult to advance or retreat, so the Japanese mainland can be fully prepared. The so-called "iron wall fortification of the Japanese mainland" facility has been promoted step by step and concretely realized because of these favorable conditions of time. We should not only praise the grandeur of the Okinawa Island operation, but also pay attention to the profound significance of the tenacious defense of Okinawa Island in the overall war situation.</p>
<p>Now, the American enemy is trying to break through the Naha-Shuri line and advance south, but the Japanese garrison is doing its best to repeatedly attack. The main force of the Okinawa Island defense is exerting its greatest effect. Although it cannot be avoided the isolation on the supply side, there are still combat elements to the enemy to wait for work, and because of the Okinawa islanders to share the same joys and sorrows, pledged to cooperate to the death, so in addition to the geographical advantage, there are also excellent conditions of harmony. According to the report of a certain special correspondent of the front line, under the shelling of the American enemy, the Okinawa islanders still planted seedlings in the dark night of dusk. This spirit of loving the hometown and increasing production is very respectable. From the point of view of the road, it is possible to imagine the degree of composure of the Okinawa islanders on the front line of the decisive battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, we can speculate from this the attitude and determination of the Japanese mainland people. Under the continuous bombing of Japanese cities, many places have been burned, but the citizens affected by the cities are more enemies. Those who have been evacuated to the countryside are working hard to increase the production of agricultural crops, and those who are determined to devote themselves to the factories in various places are contributing to the increase in the production of military supplies, and the combat power of the decisive battle can be increased a lot. It can be said that the bombing of each city in Japan by the American enemy has created the rapid completion of defense equipment in various parts of Japan. The "iron wall fortification of the Japanese mainland" was able to be completed in a short period of time because of this reason.</p>
<p>The special feature of modern warfare is the continuity of decisive battles. Although the decisive battle of Okinawa Island is much more serious than the previous decisive battles, from the point of view of the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland, Okinawa Island is only the vanguard of the recent Japanese mainland. And every inch of the Japanese mainland is the life of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people will fight a decisive battle to defend their homeland, and give the American enemy a head-on blow. The American enemy mobile unit has been cruising in the sea of Kyushu for more than two months, but still dare not try it rashly, because it knows deeply that the source of the Japanese decisive battle strength is in the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>Not only are elite troops stationed in various parts of Japan and solid fortresses have been completed, but the entire Japanese people are a united volunteer force. The Japanese people's will to fight is as strong as iron, and the Japanese mainland has thus built an iron wall fortress.</p>
<h3>Eizo Ueyama Said Taiwan Is Becoming a Battlefield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The Okinawa war situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and the importance of Taiwan Island is also increasing. The enemy forces intend to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the south by attacking Okinawa, and isolate Taiwan. The entire island of Taiwan is now full of strongholds. Under the enemy's bombing, the people of the entire island are resolutely at peace with their industries. Recently, Eizo Ueyama, a director of the Bank of Taiwan, came to Beijing from Taiwan and described it as follows: "After 50 years of governance, the results of Taiwan today are truly amazing. Governor-General Hasegawa's policy to "imperialise" the people can be said to be completely successful. The people of the island all regard themselves as subjects of the island state and are determined to defend the imperial land. For example, the Patriotic Labor Corps is now stationed under the command of the military department, engaged in production and construction with a spirit of recklessness. Now the entire island has been completely transformed into an iron-walled fortress, and this Labor Corps is working in production workshops, devoting themselves to increasing production day and night. In addition, there is the National Volunteer Corps, which has long been formed and is now preparing to be reorganized into a combat unit. As for food, they are making every effort to develop wasteland and factory land to increase production. Therefore, no matter how long the war lasts, there is no need to worry about the food situation. In recent years, enemy aircraft have been bombing persistently every day, but the residents are still as calm as before, with no fear. Although most of the houses in the cities and villages have been destroyed by bombing, the residents are still living their wartime lives in the ruins. All the functions of the bombed cities are restored to their original state on the same day, and field post offices, etc. are also handling postal affairs in makeshift shelters. The entire island of Taiwan has now become a battlefield."</p>
<h3>Ito Masanori Discusses the Significance of Decisive Battle Turning to the Offensive to Break the Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Seventh (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military commentator Ito Masanori discussed the significance of decisive battles in modern warfare as follows: "Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, there have been several decisive battles, which we all know. The battle for Singapore was also a decisive battle. After the battle of Guadalcanal, the enemy and I launched decisive battles several times. For example, the battle for Singapore was a decisive battle for our side to ensure a strategic base for advancing to the south. The decisive battle in the Malay Sea was a decisive battle to reduce the enemy's East Asian fleet, and the decisive battle in the Philippines was a decisive battle to inflict heavy damage on the enemy's army. After going through decisive battles with various purposes, the final decisive battle can be achieved, inflicting fatal damage on the enemy army. Let me give an example, namely the defense battle of the North Danish Fortress during the First World War. Germany began attacking North Denmark two years after the start of the war. The purpose was not to capture the North Danish Fortress. If it attacked this important position, the French army would definitely want to defend the area to the death and gather large forces. If so, the German army could take the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the French army's combat power and reduce the naval strength. As a result, the German army began attacking the North Danish Fortress and finally developed into a worldwide battle. What the world was paying attention to at the time was not just the point that Germany wanted to deplete the French combat power. The North Danish offensive and defensive duties were eventually forced to develop into a fortress battle. France and Germany each damaged more than 400,000 soldiers at that time. As a result, the German army's decisive battle to injure the enemy army, the German army itself also suffered considerable sword wounds, and the French army was defeated. From this, it can be seen that the purpose and nature of the decisive battle can undergo huge changes due to the strength of the enemy and my armies. A decisive battle is by no means simply fixed and unchanging. If we try to observe the enemy army's tactics in the decisive battle between Japan and the United States, we can see that the US military has adopted consistent and unchanging tactics since the Civil War. Nimitz's so-called 'island hopping tactics' are not newly created, but are based on the old ideas and tactics since the Civil War. At that time, the Union army had achieved success with the adventurous attack tactics of 'abandoning the enemy's well-prepared defensive positions and attacking easily breakthrough battle lines, and then leaping forward'. This is exactly the same as the battle line of attacking Rabaul and Taiwan. Also, the idea of creating a mobile unit is the same. Appearing in various places where the enemy army is not expected and adding attacks, so we can call it a sudden-style battle line. The Japanese army's battle line has many characteristics. In short, this kind of Japanese duty must grasp the opportunity to transfer the offensive. If this kind of opportunity is not created in Okinawa, in order to achieve the goal, it is necessary to find a favorable time and geographical advantage elsewhere. This is the modern decisive battle, and it is an inevitable fact. In other words, it is also the mobility of modern warfare. War must be won by attacking, and decisive battles must be repeated to determine the end. Therefore, in order to break the difficult situation, we must turn to the offensive."</p>
<h3>The Yu Army Is Now Actively Preparing for the General Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Eighth (Central News Agency) - The Yu side set up the Chinese Army Headquarters in Kunming on December 25 last year, and appointed He Yingqin, the chief of staff of the Yu Army, as the commander-in-chief. Under his command are Wei Lihuang's Burmese Expeditionary Force, Tang Enbo's Qian-Gui-Xiang Border Area Army, Lu Han's Dian-Yue Border Area Army, and Zhang Fakui's Fourth War Zone Army. They are all the backbone of the Yu Army equipped with modern equipment. This measure by the Yu Army is intended to respond simultaneously with the Yu Army in the interior when the US Navy realizes the landing operation on the Chinese mainland, so as to attack the Japanese army on the sea and land sides. According to the Yu Army's general headquarters for the counterattack against Japan is located in Kunming, because the US 14th Air Force, which will provide air cover for the operation in the future, and Major General Mai Yia's US combat force stationed in China, which will be responsible for heavy training and guidance of the operation, will both set up their headquarters in Kunming. Based on the need for close contact with each other, the Yu Army cannot act independently, and everything must rely on the cooperation of the US Air Force, so the Yu Army's high-pitched general counterattack against Japan is actually not surprising. However, what we cannot underestimate is that the recent US military assistance to Chongqing has become more active. In addition to strengthening the transportation capacity of the China-India air route, the United States is also planning to connect the India-Myanmar Highway from India to Myitkyina in northern Burma and the old Burma Highway to supply blood to the Yu. The plan has been largely successful. As such, the Yu Army's preparations for the general counteroffensive are progressing step by step. However, because the US Army's landing operation on the Chinese mainland has not yet been materialized, it has not been able to obtain an opportunity, but as the US Army's hard battle in Okinawa deepens, their expectation of the Yu Army's active activities on the mainland is also becoming more and more urgent. Therefore, no matter when the US Navy's mainland landing operation is carried out, the Yu Army's general counteroffensive will be launched sooner or later.</p>
<h3>Stilwell Meets MacArthur in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Eighth (Central News Agency) - According to the announcement of MacArthur's headquarters: US Army Ground Forces Commander General Stilwell met General MacArthur in Manila on the way to inspect the Southwest Pacific battle line.</p>
<h3>Proclamation of War by the National Government</h3>
<p>On December 8th of the year before last, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with our neighbor, Japan. Since then, we have initiated the New National Movement, engaged in ensuring public safety, and improved the people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and others continue to employ their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with elements in the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American war front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter East Asians. Recently, as their forces have been successively shattered by the armies and navies of our allied nation Japan, and their bases for invading Cambodia have been lost, they have resorted to even more cunning schemes and are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the National Government's rule, instigating elements in the Chongqing faction to constantly harass us, hindering the progress of various construction projects, and even directly using their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming innocent civilians. It is shameful that elements in the Chongqing faction willingly allow themselves to be used by Britain and the United States, becoming traitors to East Asia. Moreover, the deliberate and long-planned actions of Britain and the United States in East Asia, exhausting their ability to provoke and sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, are something that all East Asian peoples should stand against together in righteous anger. Therefore, the National Government declares that, from this day forward, we are in a state of war with Britain and the United States. We will exert all our strength and cooperate with our allied nation Japan to sweep away the tyranny of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share a common understanding of East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, we should further cooperate to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged with British and American forces in the West for years, repeatedly achieving glorious victories. Our nation's participation in the Greater East Asia War will echo their efforts, contributing to a new and just world order for all. All our citizens should understand that this is the only opportunity to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world all depend on this. With one heart and one mind, let us work together from beginning to end to carry out this great mission of this great era.</p>
<p>January 9th, Year 32 of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Zhao Ming</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (2)</h3>
<p>— Yi Fei</p>
<p>Journey to Shaoxing (Part 1)</p>
<p>On the Road to Xiao and Shao</p>
<p>Leaving Xiaoshan by car, there were three vehicles in total, each accompanied by five or six members of the allied forces' security team for protection. To inquire about the security situation along the way, the reporter struck up a conversation with fellow passengers. I was informed that recently, on May 7th and 8th, on the Xiaoshao highway near Yangfan Bridge, there had been repeated interceptions by roaming bandits. In addition to the loss of property, a total of twelve passengers were kidnapped or killed, creating an atmosphere of terror. The psychology of the average passenger along the way was extremely nervous. Unexpectedly, only half an hour after the car started, after passing "Qianqing Town," the front car's tire was damaged, and the car stopped for repairs. Because the area was considered dangerous, the allied soldiers all got out of the car and went to higher ground, setting up guns and ammunition for temporary security. Fortunately, the repairs were completed after twenty minutes, and we continued our journey.</p>
<p>After two and a half hours, we arrived at "Keqiao" (fifteen miles from Shaoxing). Along the highway, a small river called "Guantang" runs parallel. In the center of the river is a stone embankment (commonly known as the "Shao Embankment"), still used by boatmen carrying heavy cargo to pull and walk their boats along. Both sides of the riverbank are "pond lands," suitable for planting wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Another half hour, "Fu Mountain" comes into view, and we have arrived in Shaoxing. The car stops in the square next to the "Miss Hu" temple, which is also the location of the Shaoxing branch of the Central China Automobile Company. After getting out of the car, I went to visit the Commissioner's Office of the Fifth District of Zhejiang Province. Commissioner Yu Zhaolin was away in Hangzhou on official business, and was received by Gao Kangzhou, the secretary of the office. I heard that recently, several bridges on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway, on the other side of the Cao'e River from Baiguan to Ningbo, have been destroyed, and traffic has been suspended for three days. It is difficult to predict when traffic will resume. I can only stay for a short time and wait for a car, while taking the opportunity to investigate.</p>
<p>Population Statistics</p>
<p>The walls of Shaoxing city are gone. The entire county is divided into ten districts. Before the incident, the entire territory had a population of 1.2 million people, but now only over 700,000 remain. Taking the urban area where the county government is located as an example, the situation is the opposite. Before the incident, the entire city had only about 70,000 residents. Since the friendly forces entered Shaoxing on April 17th of the 30th year, public safety has been better guaranteed, while the countryside has been filled with roaming bandits. Wealthy families have all moved to the urban area with their families, especially after the Shaoxing County Government was restored in June of the 31st year, the rate of increase has been even greater. Now the urban area is suffering from overcrowding. According to recent statistics, it has reached more than 135,000 people.</p>
<p>General Scenery</p>
<p>Daqing Road is the most prosperous part of Shaoxing. The entire street is about two li long, starting from "Jiangqiao" in the south and ending at "Qingdao Bridge" in the north. The most peculiar thing is that, although it is the same street, the street names and house numbers of the various shops are different, such as "Qingfeng Li Kou," "Xuanting Kou," and "Dashan Temple Front," with a large number of names, about a dozen or more.</p>
<p>The entire street has a large number of Western pharmacies. The names of famous pharmacies in Shanghai are all present. In addition, there are also many silver shops and department stores, but there are no bookstores or stationery stores.</p>
<p>In addition, Shaoxing still has three things that are different from other places. Even now, there are elderly women close to seventy years old wearing bright red embroidered shoes and walking on the streets. The rickshaw pullers running through the streets each have a bell, dinging as they pass through the market. When customers purchase goods in stores, the shop assistants routinely report the bill, chanting words as if singing songs, echoing the bell sounds of the rickshaw pullers in the streets, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Famous Product: Foil Wine</p>
<p>Shaoxing's tin foil and wine are famous far and wide, and were once extremely prosperous. The former is now in decline due to the inconvenience of transportation, the increased transportation costs of raw materials ("spot copper" from other ports), and the fact that wartime people's livelihoods are difficult, non-essential products have seen a sharp decline in sales. The latter, although the local area has the "Jianhu" spring water, which is extremely suitable for winemaking (one dan of water from this lake is heavier than the same amount of water elsewhere, with each dan weighing twenty-four jin more. Because of the heavy water quality, the wine made is easier to preserve and will not deteriorate), the current transportation is not smooth, and the raw material glutinous rice must be obtained from Suzhou and Changzhou, so the source is not smooth. In order to reduce costs, a large number of brewers have successively moved to Suzhou and Changzhou to work, so the local winemaking industry in Shaoxing is now in decline, only reaching one-tenth or two-tenths of what it was before the war.</p>
<p>Education Overview</p>
<p>The entire county has more than two hundred primary schools, one county-run middle school, and three private middle schools. For public education, there is a county-run library and a public education center. The treatment of teachers is as follows: middle school teachers receive a monthly salary of 4,000 yuan, plus only three dou of school rice. Primary school teachers receive the same amount of school rice, but their salary is only 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Current Security Situation</p>
<p>Currently, the entire county of Shaoxing is stationed with allied forces, as well as the Third Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Corps and more than 300 county police officers. The security in the urban area is relatively stable, as mentioned earlier. Roaming bandits appear in the suburbs from time to time, which makes it difficult to promote county administration. The 3rd, 5th, and 9th districts under its jurisdiction, due to the special environment, are definitely beyond the reach of the county government's strength. The rest can be called semi-safe areas.</p>
<h3>The Great Powers' Veto Issue Remains Deadlocked; Three-Headed Meeting to Be Held Soon</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Truman announced last night that a meeting of Churchill, Stalin, and himself will be convened within the next forty days.</p>
<p>Central News Agency - According to a London dispatch, a Reuters diplomatic reporter recently received information from well-informed sources: in order to break the deadlock at the San Francisco Conference caused by the great powers' veto issue, the British government has directly submitted a diplomatic note to Stalin. Whether the so-called veto issue, which has become the focus of the San Francisco Conference, will be referred to the three giants Stalin, Truman, and Churchill is still too early to speculate. According to reliable sources, Marshal Stalin has agreed to hold a three-headed meeting in the near future, but the date has not yet been determined. However, the San Francisco Conference has been open for a long time and has not yet ended, and cannot be delayed indefinitely. Although the United Kingdom is eager to achieve a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible, the Soviet Union completely refuses to compromise. Since receiving instructions from Moscow on the veto issue on June 2nd, the Soviet delegation has stated its opposition to the Security Council's retention of the veto issue. Although the United Kingdom and the United States agree to limit the use of the veto to the "action" stage, they oppose expanding the veto to the investigation stage. The Soviet Union's proposal is that the veto should be reserved only for procedural issues. However, the group of small countries that fundamentally oppose the exercise of the veto by the great powers absolutely oppose the Soviet Union's view. The reason why the small countries dare to shout and wave the flag is said to be due to the support of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Chongqing. Therefore, if the Soviet Union stubbornly adheres to its position, it will not be able to gain the support of the conference. Conversely, if it stubbornly opposes the Soviet Union's proposal, the Soviet Union may reject the world organization. Before Marshal Stalin makes a new review of this issue, it is difficult to expect new developments in this issue. World public opinion has already recognized the importance of the veto issue.</p>
<h3>Song's Return to Chongqing to Include Visit to Moscow</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, Song Ziwen, who is currently staying in San Francisco, will visit Moscow en route to Chongqing to meet with Stalin. This should be based on the major resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of Chongqing to improve relations with the Soviet Union, which has close ties with China after the war and possesses powerful strength. However, Song's mission to the Soviet Union is nothing more than the following two points: 1. Compromise on the issue of the Southwest Asia region; 2. Resolution of the Yan'an issue; 3. Decision on military, political, and economic matters in the Northwest. Regarding the resolution of the Yan'an issue, according to the editorial of the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency's Liberation Daily on the 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek still views the Kuomintang-Communist issue as a domestic political issue at the Sixth Plenary Session, without changing his long-held attitude. Regarding this issue, as Zhou Enlai said, if Chongqing does not abandon its political contradictions, namely its dictatorial and reactionary actions, Yan'an will always constantly fight against Chongqing, expressing a tough attitude towards Chongqing. On the other hand, with the end of the European war, the Soviet Union, from its own position, intends to move military, political, and economic forces in the border areas of Xinjiang and Shaanxi to expand its influence. Now, Song Ziwen is ordered to try his best to ingratiate himself with the Soviet Union, but whether it can achieve satisfactory results is still doubtful.</p>
<p>Competition Between U.S. and Soviet Forces</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - Since Mao Zedong made a shocking declaration at the Seventh National Congress of Yan'an, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party has reversed, and the political struggle is on the verge of armed conflict. The encirclement of Chongqing's Tenth War Zone by the Yan'an army and the attempt to advance south to Ruijin, Jiangxi Province, have made the Kuomintang-Communist issue attract international attention with the U.S. and Soviet forces as its background. Its trends are extremely worthy of attention. The Dazhong Bao issued by Chongqing's Guangdong Province revealed that when the Chongqing government held the Sixth Plenary Session a few days ago, it formally denied the Republic of Outer Mongolia. According to the newspaper, Chongqing will grant Outer Mongolia the greatest autonomy. Since Outer Mongolia formally guaranteed its status as Chinese territory in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1924, the Republic of Outer Mongolia, which was established in 1921, cannot be recognized. It is also rumored that recently, the Chongqing army in Xinjiang Province had an armed conflict with the Cossack army. At a time when the competition between the U.S. and Soviet forces in Chongqing is gradually intensifying, the Chongqing government's formal denial of the Republic of Outer Mongolia is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Being Formed in Iran</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Tehran dispatch, Sattar, the former Minister of Justice of Iran, was ordered yesterday to form a new cabinet. Yesterday, the leaders and parties in the Iranian parliament, by an absolute majority of sixty votes to eight, supported Sattar in forming a new cabinet.</p>
<h3>France Proposes Convening a Five-Power Conference to Discuss Middle East Issues</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Paris report, the French government sent instructions to its ambassadors to London, Washington, Moscow, and Chongqing yesterday, instructing them to convey the French government's proposal to convene a "Five-Power Conference" to discuss Middle East issues to the governments of the aforementioned four countries.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to information received here, British Minister of State for Middle Eastern Affairs Grick declared in Cairo yesterday that the British government opposes France's proposal to resolve various Middle East issues through a "Five-Power Conference." The British government believes that the countries that should participate in this conference should be limited to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and relevant Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<h3>Spain Extradites Laval</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Former French leader Laval, who sought refuge near Barcelona, Spain, before Germany surrendered, was arrested and detained by the Spanish authorities until he was sent back to France by air on the 5th of this month.</p>

<h3>Today is the 18th Air Defense Day; Air Defense Drills to Be Conducted; Pay Attention to Light Leakage During Blackouts</h3>
<p>Today (the 9th) is the 18th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will expand its publicity on the significance of air defense as usual, and conduct various air defense drills, including alarm drills, localized area drills, and comprehensive drills.

<h3>Director Liu of the Economic Bureau Discusses Recent Economic Policies Answers Questions at Press Conference</h3>
<p>The 20th press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at 10:30 a.m. yesterday (the 8th) in the City Conference Room, with Director Liu Xingchen of the Economic Bureau attending to answer questions raised by various newspapers. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Policy Guidelines</p>
<p>(Question) What are the future policy guidelines for promoting economic administration? (Answer) The economic administration of this bureau is to follow the central laws and regulations and actively promote them in accordance with the intentions of the municipal authorities. The handling of economic bills will only seek to be legal and reasonable. In terms of affairs, it will be agile and rapid, with the aim of gradually bringing the turbulent economic situation into order.</p>
<p>Priority Rationing</p>
<p>(Question) The priority rationing for the second half of March was out of stock and has not been replenished. Is there any hope of recovery recently? (Answer) We are currently discussing with relevant parties to allocate rice. Once we receive it, we will consider the quantity and restore rationing and replenishment separately.</p>
<p>(Question) After the Municipal Goods Rationing Office was abolished and transferred to the Economic Bureau, are there any concrete plans for household rationing in the future? (Answer) We are still actively handling household rationing. All comprehensive rationing certificates Nos. 61 to 90 are being rushed out. Recently, each household flour per certificate with No. 47 comprehensive rationing certificate is one catty, and the price is still 400 yuan. Other items are also being processed at any time. As long as the source is slightly smooth, they can be distributed one after another.</p>
<p>(Question) When can the priority rationing for this period be distributed? (Answer) Rationing can be done as soon as the rice arrives.</p>
<p>Suppressing Prices</p>
<p>(Question) In the past two weeks, the price increase in this city has become more severe. The market prices sold by manufacturers and stores have exceeded the limited price by about three times, which has a significant impact on people's livelihood. What measures does your bureau have to deal with this? What steps will be taken to suppress prices? (Answer) Recently, market prices sold by stores have exceeded the limited price. The police bureau will send economic inspectors to step up the investigation, and those found to be true will be severely punished. Regarding suppressing prices, in addition to strictly assessing and enforcing limited prices, we have also discussed emergency measures with relevant authorities.</p>
<p>(Question) Shops often raise prices without approval, which fuels the price increase. In the future, your bureau can issue a public notice of the limited price for each item, ordering each shop to hang the limited price list of the goods sold in a prominent position to prevent merchants from cheating. At the same time, the industry associations should also be responsible for supervision. Your bureau has not yet implemented this measure. What is the reason? (Answer) Shops should have labels for the goods they sell, indicating the selling price, and the approved price list should be affixed in a conspicuous place in the house. This bureau has repeatedly ordered compliance. In addition to ordering the various associations to be responsible for supervision recently, we have also presented a report to the municipal government for publication. Those who violate the law will be punished. We are currently strictly handling this, and the police bureau is executing it.</p>
<p>(Question) The large cakes and cooked water businesses are closely related to the lives of citizens. Recently, they have illegally raised prices without authorization. What punishment measures does your bureau have for this? (Answer) The police bureau has been strictly investigating and handling the illegal price increases in the large cakes and cooked water industries.</p>
<p>(Question) It is recently heard that there are people who manipulate the purchase of machine ice and have to pay tips every month. How will your bureau deal with this? (Answer) We will send personnel to investigate thoroughly and deal with it according to law.</p>
<p>Strengthening Associations</p>
<p>(Question) What is the situation of strengthening the institutions and personnel of various industry associations? (Answer) Industry associations are industrial and commercial groups whose main purpose is to assist the government in promoting economic policies and seeking the common welfare of the industry. However, most of the people in charge of general associations only talk about business, and they often focus on the convenience of their business and ignore assisting the government in promoting economic policies. At present, the most important thing is to prevent hoarding and suppress prices. However, in order to achieve this goal, the association itself must be sound and must thoroughly understand the business situation of the industry. Therefore, we are actively strengthening the industry institutions, rectifying the selection of responsible persons for the associations, and adding investigation and registration groups to the various industry associations to investigate the import and export of goods of the industry members. This bureau has completed the investigation of the recent situation of the various industry associations in this city and is currently reviewing the situation of each industry and formulating methods to strengthen the organization and improve personnel in order to adjust.</p>
<p>Commodity Registration</p>
<p>(Question) What is the situation of the registration of major commodities? (Answer) This bureau handles the registration and transfer permission of major commodities in accordance with the major commodity list, which includes eight categories: 1. Fiber, 2. Chemical Industrial Products, 3. Industrial Oils and Fats, 4. Rubber, 5. Hardware, 6. Electrical Materials, 7. Leather Raw Materials, 8. White Paper (Poster Paper), and the four principles approved by the Executive Yuan. We presented it to the municipal government and the Ministry of Industry for approval, scheduled registration, and ordered the various major commodity industry associations to transfer it to their members for handling. As of now, the department stores and chemical industry raw material associations have complied with the order and registered with the bureau. Other associations have not yet submitted the registration forms and are being urged to expedite.</p>
<p>Restoring Factory Electricity</p>
<p>(Question) Factories in various industries have been without electricity for a long time, which has greatly affected production increases. Is there any hope of restoring electricity for general industrial use? (Answer) This bureau submitted the electricity consumption survey forms filled out by the factories to the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company in January and March of this year, requesting that they find a way to allocate electricity. However, the shortage of coal is also a fact, and we are negotiating with them on how to handle it.</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, rice prices have been soaring. If your bureau can ration household rice on schedule, it would be the most effective way to suppress prices. Does your bureau have this consideration? (Answer) We are discussing with relevant parties.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding the two measures of "resolutely suppressing the rice price surge" and "actively clearing the source," what is the specific situation of your bureau's current progress? (Answer) Regarding "resolutely suppressing the rice price surge," we have earnestly implemented it with the police bureau to punish illegal rice merchants. As for "actively clearing the source," we are currently working with relevant authorities to make every effort to plan and implement it.</p>

<h3>The Ironclad Japanese Mainland Fortress: One Hundred Million Soldiers and Civilians Await a Chance to Annihilate the Enemy</h3>
<p>Just as the decisive battle of Okinawa intensifies, the fortification of the Japanese mainland is also nearing completion. What exactly does the fortification of the Japanese mainland entail? This is something many people would like to know. Since the Battle of Guadalcanal, the elite Japanese troops stationed on isolated Pacific islands have often been gloriously annihilated under enemy shelling, bombing, and overwhelming numerical superiority. Moreover, on the European front, the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line, touted as the pinnacle of modern fortifications, failed to achieve their intended effect, and the defensive lines built by the German army on the Eastern Front also failed to defend Berlin. In view of these facts, even though the Japanese mainland fortress is said to be as solid as a rock, to what extent can it withstand enemy carpet bombing or the assault of mechanized units? One cannot help but have doubts. The reporter is also someone who lacks confidence in this regard. However, this unease and fear completely dissipated after inspecting various locations, and I now firmly believe that Japan is as secure as Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Now, I will specifically describe the combat power of the Japanese military and civilians, focused primarily on building defensive works, to refresh the world's understanding and hopefully achieve final victory.</p>
<p>The Interception Posture Has Changed</p>
<p>Here, it is essential to consider the essence of the enemy's combat power. That is, the strength of the American enemy lies in intense naval gun bombardment, large-scale air raids, and superior mechanized equipment.</p>
<p>From Guadalcanal to Okinawa, the consistent American method has been to expend vast amounts of materiel on shelling and bombing, coupled with assaults by superior mechanized units. Therefore, if they can be rendered useless in bombing and powerless in mechanized warfare, the American army will lose all its fighting power and become no different from "clay puppets." To crush a weak and powerless enemy is not difficult, even without understanding Sun Tzu's Art of War. The only question is how to stop the enemy's naval gun bombardment, make their air raids ineffective, and hinder the invasion of their mechanized units. These are not easy problems to solve. However, Japan's interception posture has now changed. No matter how fierce the American naval gun bombardment, how rampant the enemy air control, or how forceful the mechanized assault, it is now possible to completely neutralize them and annihilate them in the mainland interception battle. As for the specific method, it is, of course, the fortification of the mainland.</p>
<p>Mountains, Rivers, Plants, and Trees Are All Fortresses</p>
<p>This fortification is by no means a fragile defensive line based on traditional strategic thinking, but is entirely based on the Japanese army's unique strategy and conception. That is, the fortresses built on the Japanese mainland are not built in specific places or zones, which differs from the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line. Moreover, construction does not require vast materials and labor like European fortresses, and the time required is also short. Therefore, in times of crisis, formidable fortresses can appear in a matter of days, and the positions can be expanded infinitely depending on the war situation at the time. Thus, areas that are not defensive positions today can become complete fortress zones in a few days. In the rapidly advancing modern warfare, permanent fixed positions such as the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line are not only too slow in terms of time, but even if they were on time, they could not be expected to have much effect. The recent European war is a good example of this. But the fortresses on the Japanese mainland can be said to fully meet the requirements of modern warfare. It is said that Toyotomi Hideyoshi once built a castle in one night. In today's battle situation, where every moment is crucial, the fortress engineering designed by the Japanese army is even more meaningful than Toyotomi Hideyoshi's castle construction and is a decisive factor in victory.</p>
<p>Toyotomi Hideyoshi's castle construction differs from the current fortress engineering on the Japanese mainland in three ways. First, the castles built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi were intended to intimidate the enemy and discourage them, so their form was particularly majestic and awe-inspiring, easily recognizable. However, today's Japanese mainland fortresses are completely concealed. In terms of concealment, it can be said that it has reached the pinnacle. Its scale and sophistication are unknowable to anyone other than the designing officers and the troops stationed there. As a result, even staff officers cannot immediately determine where the defensive positions are and where they are not. As for the enemy, even if they send B-29 aircraft to scout day and night, they cannot ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>When the reporter was first brought into this defensive position, what met my eyes was a peaceful rural landscape, with only the clear and beautiful mountains and rivers dripping with new greenery, with nothing suspicious about it. It was only when I stepped on key points of the position that I realized that everything was a terrifying fortress.</p>
<p>Of course, the reporter is an outsider, and there is no way to know the details of the overall appearance of the fortress or the concept of the deployment. But after inspecting the area, I felt that the mountains, rivers, plants, and trees I saw there were all fortresses, all solid strongholds.</p>
<p>In fact, our mountains, rivers, plants, and trees can all be transformed into fortresses, and their construction is extremely easy, so it is by no means impossible to turn the entire Japanese mainland into a fortress.</p>
<p>Secondly, what distinguishes it from traditional castles is that ancient fixed castles had a front, sides, and back, whereas today's fortresses on the Japanese mainland have no specific face. They can become left or right depending on the war situation at the time. To put it more simply, they are flexible in that they can attack when advancing and defend when retreating. Fortification lines such as the Maginot Line and Siegfried Line only faced the front. Once the enemy broke through at one point and bypassed them, they were at a loss. However, the fortresses on the Japanese mainland can overlook all directions. No matter which direction, east, west, north, or south, they can fully exert their power.</p>
<p>An American Invasion Will Necessitate Much Bloodshed</p>
<p>The final point is that, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, they are not restricted by area. This was unthinkable for permanent fixed positions in the past. The fortresses built on the Japanese mainland today can be expanded and moved as needed. Therefore, even if a certain location is surrounded by the enemy, there is no need to worry. In such a situation, it only takes some time and a little work to freely connect with the neighboring strongholds and respond to the new war situation.</p>
<p>In short, when such a mainland fortress is completed, no matter how much material the American enemy invests or how eager they are to carry out mainland operations, it will be difficult to harm a single Japanese soldier or a single farmer. Even if their mechanized units manage to land, it will be difficult to find Japanese soldiers on the ground. On the contrary, they will be subjected to the Japanese army's accurate artillery fire and will bleed profusely.</p>
<p>Underground Fortresses are Unprecedentedly Strong</p>
<p>Next, let's explain why the Japanese army's defensive positions can withstand enemy shelling, bombing, and the assault of mechanized units. Japan's mainland defense works are all deep underground. Among them are large and small trenches stretching horizontally and vertically, as well as soldiers' living quarters, ammunition depots, food stores, water wells, kitchens, bathrooms, barracks, and everything else. On the outside, there are various artillery positions, all connected by trenches. Therefore, even if the enemy battleship's main guns continue to fire fiercely day and night, they will only dig up the surface soil. It has no effect on the Japanese army's underground positions. The situation is similar with enemy bombing. Although air raids can cause damage to cities and factories beyond imagination, it is impossible to attack positions deep underground with even the largest bombs or incendiary bombs.</p>
<p>Even if the enemy's mechanized units are able to land and launch an attack, they have no way of guessing from which direction they will be attacked by the completely hidden underground fortress artillery fire. Even if the Japanese army's weakness is discovered and they are subjected to a strong attack, the design of the Japanese army's fortresses has long taken into full consideration the power of the enemy's flamethrowers and wind, so they are unaffected. Moreover, the fire nets of each position and the interrelationship between adjacent positions are carefully studied and designed by the Japanese army's unique fortress experts, so there are no blind spots in the entire line. Therefore, once the enemy penetrates this position, they will be subjected to intense artillery fire from all directions and will inevitably be annihilated.</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy is that in the mainland interception battle, all Japanese soldiers will use the aforementioned underground fortresses as a base, with large and small artillery pieces, not to mention grenade launchers, and will resolutely defend the underground line, launching a brave interception operation and heavily striking the enemy's combat power. This style of fighting is a major leap in strategic thinking compared to the recent ground battles in Europe. The defense works on the Japanese mainland are an unprecedentedly strong formation in the history of world warfare, and there is no precedent for it in the previous Pacific War.</p>
<p>In short, since the Battle of Guadalcanal, the Japanese army's Pacific War has been mainly a war of attrition to buy time. However, as it evolves into a mainland interception battle, its nature suddenly changes, turning into an operation to thoroughly annihilate the American army. Therefore, if the enemy invades the Japanese mainland, the Japanese army's strong defensive line will fundamentally overturn their material warfare strategy, causing them to suffer a decisive defeat. This is as clear as day.</p>
<p>Military and Civilians are United with High Morale</p>
<p>Next, let me introduce the soaring morale of the Japanese soldiers defending the strong positions.</p>
<p>When the commander-in-chief took office, he distributed the following training to all the troops under his command: "Quickly complete strategic deployment. Thoroughly strengthen fortress construction. Precise training." These are the three principles for annihilating the enemy. Today's war situation is as tense as if the entire country of Japan has become a battlefield. Therefore, in order to fully realize the three principles, even those who are killed or injured are disregarded. Those who are injured as a result are all treated as war wounded.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this, all the soldiers worked day and night to desperately promote the operational plan to annihilate the enemy. The morale of the front-line troops is indeed high! In particular, the soldiers who are natives of the local area, from the unit commander down to the private, are all willing to die for the land, and their soaring morale is so high that it reaches the heavens. Such a military, united with the local villagers who have a blood relationship, is powerful enough to crush tens or hundreds of times the enemy's army. On such a front line, the young company commander has a complete style of a lord. He has mastered the art of managing his subordinates and winning the hearts of the people. The elite troops under his command are also very respectable in their magnificent spirit. Once deployed, they will continue the construction of bunkers and trenches day and night, even without special orders. Moreover, for all fortress construction matters, as long as they are shown the basic design drawings, there is no need to supervise them one by one. The soldiers will add their own creative ideas to create good fortresses that exceed expectations.</p>
<p>Countless Ammunition Stored, the Enemy is Destined to Lose</p>
<p>On the front line, company commanders and squad leaders also personally directed the progress of the defensive works, covered in mud. As a result, the work crews working under their command, including medical officers, veterinarians, and even the unit headquarters secretaries, worked shirtless, wielding shovels in deep tunnels, forgetting to eat and sleep.</p>
<p>Here, the lack of materials and labor are all compensated for by innovative methods. Apart from the belief in certain victory, the soldiers have no other thoughts. In their hearts, the first is certain victory, the second is certain victory, and the third is still certain victory! These tense soldiers show no signs of being affected by the unnatural underground trench life. Although they sleep in the trenches, work in the trenches, and eat in the trenches, none of them have suffered any damage to their health.</p>
<p>The reporter was led to visit a certain artillery observation post. According to a non-commissioned officer, "The artillery positions, as you saw during the visit, have soundproofing equipment. A few days ago, we conducted live ammunition firing trials, and there was no reverberation in the trenches. However, because it was a headwind at that time, carbon dioxide flowed into the trenches, but none of the people in the positions were harmed."</p>
<p>Then, he explained to me the various situations of the artillery emplacement. Finally, he pointed to the chart on the wall of the observation post and said, "The enemy's landing craft, various vehicles, and even artillery are all detailed on this chart. In a unified area, we have now transported enough shells to this position to crush thousands of enemy vehicles. We will not waste a single shell!"</p>
<p>Ha ha, the artillery, which only occupies one point of the position, can also destroy thousands of enemy tanks! From this, we can see the spirit of all the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Preparing Everything and Waiting for the Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy</p>
<p>Observing this, we can see that in the local battles on the Japanese mainland, the cooperation between the military and civilians is close and the unity is sincere. Moreover, there is absolutely no shortage of food, materials, or labor. This is understood by the European countries, so the Japanese military and civilians will never lose their will to fight due to food and economic conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decisive battle situation in Japan is progressing with each passing day and is becoming increasingly strengthened. This makes me deeply feel the greatness of the potential power cultivated by the three thousand years of history since the founding of the country. We have completed our strategic deployment under a strategic posture as solid as a rock, and have deployed a million elite troops. Now, on our mainland fortress, which is destined to win, all one hundred million Japanese military and civilians are burning with fighting spirit, waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy.

<h3>A Diagram of the Political Disputes in Europe and the Near East</h3>
<p>Since the end of the European war last month, disputes have arisen from time to time among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union due to competition for power and profits. The main disputes are as follows:</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's recovery of the ports of Trieste and Istria in the lost territory has been opposed by the British and American occupation forces, who have a desire for dominance.</p>
<p>The French army's entry into Syria and Lebanon has been intervened in by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Iran's request for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to withdraw their troops has been agreed to by Britain and the United States for consideration, but the Soviet Union has not yet replied.</p>
<p>After Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France signed an agreement to separately occupy areas of German territory (Britain occupies the northwest, the United States occupies the southwest, the Soviet Union occupies the east, and France occupies a corner of the west, with the city of Berlin under joint control by the four countries), the Soviet authorities then demanded that the American army withdraw from the Leipzig and Saxony regions, and requested that Britain withdraw from areas such as Lübeck and Wismar in the north.</p>

<h3>Construction Administration Since the Bing Month</h3>
<p>— Xu Jidun</p>
<p>Management of Road Administration and Flood Control Facilities</p>
<p>The road administration in various districts of this city has always been considered perfect, but since the incident, the road construction materials have been exhausted, and economic fundraising has been difficult, resulting in the inability to implement maintenance projects and various road administration plans that should be improved as soon as possible. In the past two months, due to the military importance of suburban highways, they had to be repaired in advance, so all the workers were concentrated in the suburbs. Now that the suburban roads can be completed as scheduled, the repair of roads in the city and the implementation of flood control projects in the western district are being planned. How the plan will be implemented can also be described. It is found that the traffic near the North Railway Station in this city has always been very frequent, and today, the width is even more insufficient. Other roads such as the Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai, and Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Datong Road, Great Shanghai Road, and Taishan Road are all major trunk roads in the city. Due to years of disrepair, they are uneven, making it inconvenient for travelers. The Bureau is now planning to actively repair the trunk lines, and has prepared a budget and submitted it to the municipal government for verification.</p>
<p>The terrain of the western district of this city has always been very low-lying, and whenever there is heavy rain, water accumulates into puddles, which is especially easy to cause disasters during the spring floods. The Bureau is now planning to modify the important sections of the district with large-scale ditches and pipes, and to dredge the main rivers to facilitate the discharge of rainwater. It is found that the underground drainage works in this city are actually due to the excessive pressure of houses, the gradual downward movement of the base, and the rise of the water level of the Huangpu River. To talk about a fundamental solution, we must first dredge the Huangpu River, which is a large-scale project. Over the years, a perfect solution has not been obtained, and it is beyond the current financial and material resources. The Bureau is now establishing a fundamental solution in the midst of a temporary solution, with a view to gradually promoting it and gradually seeking a complete solution.</p>
<p>Management of Construction, Gardening, and Other Facilities</p>
<p>The management of construction enterprises is nothing more than reviewing plans. Regarding the review matters, the Bureau has revised the construction regulations to suit the current environment, and the various building permit fees have also been drafted to suit the actual situation, and new fee rates are being submitted to the government for approval and implementation. In the future, illegal buildings will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>It is also stipulated that all kinds of construction drawings must uniformly use the metric system in order to unify them. As for planning matters, in view of the importance of war transportation and the evacuation of the population in this city, the Bureau has repaired the bridges in the Shanghai suburban area, such as the bridges on the Xihulu Road from Bridge No. 166 to Bridge No. 135, Bridge No. 15 on the Jialuo Road, the bridges damaged on the Huthai Road from Dachang to Luodian section, the Majing Bridge and Zhuanqiao on the Luobao Road, the bridges damaged on the Suhu Road from Bridge No. 1 on the South Road to the GuPu Bridge, and Bridges No. 7, 8, and 10 on the Shangsong Road. All the plans have been completed, and construction work will be started as soon as the municipal government approves them.</p>
<p>As for the citizens' request to demolish houses, in the past, the malpractices were very deep. At present, the issuance of this license is very cautious. Unless it complies with the demolition regulations, it will not be issued at will.</p>
<p>Regarding the management of gardening, in view of the dense population of this city and the close arrangement of houses, the establishment of parks everywhere is very important. It is found that the parks under the jurisdiction of the Bureau now include Zhongshan, Outer, Hongkou, Tongbei, Daxing, Taishan, Dihua, and Hengshan parks. After the Bureau's efforts to rectify them, the equipment has gradually become perfect. Recently, in order to think about the citizens' physical and intellectual education, animal gardens, sports fields, fishing platforms, children's parks, music stages, and flower beds have been arranged in various parks, so that citizens can not only use them to regulate their body and mind, but also to increase their knowledge.</p>
<p>Inspection Work Facilities</p>
<p>The scope of work of the Inspection Office of the Bureau is roughly divided into three categories: the analysis and refining of sewage, the preparation of asphalt road materials, and the testing and chemical testing of building materials and fuels. Regarding the analysis and refining of sewage in this city, since most of the houses in various districts are equipped with flush toilets, the sewage drawn from the flush toilets contains countless infectious bacteria. The Bureau has set up three plants in the east, west, and north, using the latest, most effective, and most economical refining method to separate infectious bacteria from sewage, and then introduce the clear water into rivers. The refined sludge contains 3% to 6% of light matter and 1.5% to 2.5% of matter, which is a good fertilizer for farmland.</p>
<p>Regarding the preparation of asphalt road materials, the Bureau has set up an asphalt plant and an asphalt chemical testing room to prepare asphalt road materials. The methods are divided into two types: hot method and cold method. The best one is manufactured by the hot method, but the preparation method is quite complicated, and it requires fuels such as coal and kerosene. At the time when fuel is lacking, this method is no longer applicable. Therefore, research on the cold method of manufacturing asphalt sand has been spared no effort recently. The products manufactured by the cold method have achieved very good results, and no fuels such as kerosene are required during manufacturing. Only old asphalt sand is used with a small amount of mineral oil.</p>
<p>As for the testing room and chemical testing room for building materials and fuels, there are several rooms, and each room is equipped with an electric testing machine, a pneumatic machine, a cement testing machine, and various chemical testing machines to test various materials used in engineering, and fuels for automobiles and boilers. In addition to supplying the Bureau with various tests, it also tests samples sent by the outside world.</p>
<p>Measures to Increase Water and Electricity Prices</p>
<p>Regarding the various public utilities in this city, such as electric lights, gas, tap water, telephones, trams, and public buses, in addition to the former eight districts being operated by the French Electric Light and Tram Company, the rest are within the business scope of the Sino-Japanese joint venture company. Citizens have expressed dissatisfaction with the repeated reduction in supply and price increases of the above-mentioned public facilities. The Bureau also believes that this situation affects the lives of citizens and increases the burden on citizens. As the Bureau's responsibility lies, it cannot but rectify them. Therefore, it has been submitted by the municipal government to the Ministry of Construction to determine the Bureau's management and supervision powers. Before receiving a reply, the Bureau has already closely contacted the relevant companies separately. (End)</p>
<h3>Solving the Food Crisis</h3>
<p>Part One: Hu Caijuan</p>
<p>The current food crisis has reached its most critical point. The *Shenbao* editorial has repeatedly discussed how to regulate food supply and suppress prices, offering many insightful and thorough warnings. Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's "A Humble Proposal to Solve the Food Panic" and Mr. Luo Han's "Unmissable Countermeasures for Famine Relief" are also direct responses to reality, urgently appealing for action. I believe many readers naturally feel immense sympathy and admiration for these efforts!</p>
<p>However, what practical help do mere sympathy and admiration offer? Although the power to decide ultimately lies with the municipal authorities, we, the common people, face starvation imminently. When even the most basic needs for survival cannot be met, we should break our long-standing silence and offer our opinions to the municipal authorities. This will let them know that a large portion of the population is indeed suffering immensely. Or, more proactively, we can mediate to alleviate the people's distress. Shanghai is considered a cultural metropolis, especially with many intellectuals gathering here after the war. But what are their responsibilities? Are they afraid to speak up during this time of crisis? I hope that many intellectuals and socially conscious individuals, not just those in the news industry, will enthusiastically contribute their opinions. Those with specialized expertise in food procurement should volunteer their advice and offer their services to the city government. Then, under the united and earnest request of the citizens, the municipal authorities will naturally accept the majority's opinions and implement them one by one. This will ensure public safety, strengthen fighting power, and make victory in the Greater East Asia War attainable.</p>
<p>As a housewife and mother of six, I offer the following suggestions, representing the wishes of the majority of the people:</p>
<p>Expeditiously Reinstate the Household Rationing System: The household rationing system has been practically suspended since last autumn. Regarding food, rice has never been rationed even once, and flour has only been rationed four times. For daily necessities, matches and soap have each been rationed approximately twice. Today, the black market price of rice has exceeded 50 yuan. If food rationing can be reinstated, whether rice, flour, or coarse grains, and maintained consistently, hoarders will naturally release their goods and dump them onto the market. The public's morale will stabilize due to the restoration of the rationing system, eliminating the need to anxiously seek supplies on the black market, and rice prices will gradually decrease. General commodity prices will also follow suit, tending towards stability.</p>
<p>Improve the System of Distributing Government-Subsidized Rice: The original intention of government-subsidized rice was to have various guilds distribute it to their members for the use of low-wage workers. However, the result is that guilds, factories, businesses, and other organizations use the subsidized rice for all employee meals, without distributing it specifically to low-wage workers. This effectively saves business owners money on employee meals. Why should the rice obtained by the city government under extremely difficult circumstances be consumed in this way? Therefore, the current system of distributing subsidized rice must be drastically reformed. All centralized allocation to guilds should be abolished, and the large amount of rice saved should be incorporated into the household rice rationing system and distributed on a regular basis. In this way, all low-wage workers will benefit directly from household rice rationing, and the suffering of the people will be greatly alleviated.</p>
<p>Swiftly and Strictly Investigate Hoarding of Goods and Impose Confiscation and Punishment: The soaring prices in Shanghai are largely due to hoarding by unscrupulous individuals. Although the authorities have issued orders and repeated them many times, they have not achieved practical results. How should decisive measures be taken to prevent the situation from worsening and to relieve the people's suffering?</p>
<p>Although the above three points are not exhaustive, if they can be fully implemented, the rising tide of prices can be defeated in the near future, and the citizens will express their sincere gratitude and best wishes.</p>
<p>Part Two: Bangzhu</p>
<p>Recently, prices in this city have risen again in cycles, especially for rice. If this continues unabated and no measures are taken to stop it, the lives of the poor will become unbearable. I will briefly describe my humble opinions below:</p>
<p>(A) Unblock Supply Channels: Although this point is a cliché, it has not yet been realized, which is deeply regrettable. The frequent reports of illegal obstruction by military police along the way are also a major reason for the obstructed flow of supplies. Local officials are undeniably at fault for employing incompetent personnel. It is hoped that measures will be taken to rectify this and enforce discipline, so that goods can circulate, costs can be reduced, and prices will naturally fall.</p>
<p>(B) Suppress Speculation: Although this sudden price increase is due to rising costs in rice-producing areas, it certainly cannot account for a doubling of prices within a few days. There is no doubt that unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the situation, spreading rumors, and reaping profits. These people only know personal gain and disregard the public good, which is extremely hateful. If speculation is not suppressed, not only will the price of rice never return to normal, but other commodities will also be difficult to stabilize. To eliminate speculation, I suggest that officials be sent to secretly investigate and that households be encouraged to report any speculators they find. This concerns the interests of the citizens, and they will be happy to do so. Once discovered, severe punishments should be imposed. When Mayor Zhou took office, he said in his public announcement to the citizens: "In chaotic times, use harsh measures." In this way, speculation may be eradicated, reducing the threat to people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>(C) Distribute Rationed Rice Early: Today, the rice consumed by citizens is largely dependent on black market supplies because there is no hope of household rice rationing. This is also a major reason for the rampant black market rice trade. I do not know why the Commodity Rationing Office is silent, making citizens wait in vain. The urgent task is to find a way to distribute rations early to alleviate the people's distress and to avoid delays in the future, so that citizens do not need to rely on the black market, which will then have no opportunity to flourish.</p>
<p>I hope that the authorities will adopt the above points, and the citizens will be fortunate!</p>
<h3>The City's Fire Hydrants Urgently Need Repair</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mingliang</p>
<p>According to the report in the newspaper on the 16th of this month about the fire in Yuyao, "The four fire hydrants on Yuyao Road could not produce a drop of water due to years of disrepair. After searching around, they finally found a fire hydrant in front of No. 1171 Kangding Road at the Jin Situ Temple. However, the hose was not long enough, so they were busy finding a hose. By the time the hoses prepared in each district were delivered, a lot of time had been wasted." In the end, the fire spread and could not be contained, resulting in the most extensive disaster in recent years. From the above, it is clear that the fire hydrants needed urgent repairs. I would like to briefly describe my humble opinions below, to avoid repeating the mistakes and hoping that the municipal authorities will study and adopt them.</p>
<p>Immediately order the fire department to promptly inspect the fire hydrants for damage and disrepair. If any are found, personnel should be dispatched to repair them quickly.</p>
<p>If the fire department has not inspected the hydrants or notified the neighborhood associations to inspect them, each neighborhood association must report to the fire department any damaged or unrepaired fire hydrants within its jurisdiction, awaiting dispatch of personnel for repairs, or, within its capabilities, fund the repairs themselves.</p>
<p>Each district's fire department should keep on hand a number of hoses with lengths equal to the distance between two fire hydrants, to prevent emergencies. Even if one fire hydrant is damaged, it will not cause much disruption.</p>
<p>If the above three points are fully implemented, it will be a small help in the event of an air raid or fire in the future, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Bai Mao</p>
<h3>Bangle</h3>
<p>— Hou Qianli</p>
<p>Mrs. He felt heartbroken whenever she thought of that gold bangle.</p>
<p>Indeed, that gold bangle had been with her for twenty years after her marriage. Those dreamlike long years had been filled with countless tears. Apart from her daughter, that bangle was probably her closest companion for over a decade after her husband died.</p>
<p>Earlier, that bangle had a companion. When she brought them as part of her dowry, the pair of bangles were packed in a very delicate box and tied with red and green silk threads. When her mother personally untied the box and put the bangles on her daughter's wrists, when the gold bangles glittered and dazzled people's eyes, would it – and its owner – have imagined today?</p>
<p>Less than five years after her marriage, her husband died. In extreme financial difficulties, Mrs. He very painfully destroyed one bangle and used it to pay off all the expenses, to send away those hideous faces of the creditors. How painfully she destroyed that bangle!</p>
<p>From then on, only one of the pair remained. Mrs. He said:</p>
<p>"No matter what, I can't destroy that bangle again. Even if I have to eat tree bark, I have to keep it." She kept the remaining bangle, but sold off the rest of her dowry. After her husband's death, the few acres of land in her hometown were said to be enough for her and her daughter to live on, but these days, people with land could only sigh when looking at it. She had no choice but to move the furniture she had brought as dowry, piece by piece, out of the house, and when large sums of money were needed, she had to reluctantly pick out one or two pieces from her limited jewelry.</p>
<p>Only that gold bangle, which had lost its companion, was always wrapped in red paper.</p>
<p>"Even if I have to eat tree bark, I have to keep it."</p>
<p>Every time she opened her small handbag and rummaged through it, Mrs. He thought this way.</p>
<p>Of course, she should keep it – not for herself. Mrs. He had a daughter, and she placed all her hopes on that young daughter. She was living for her daughter.</p>
<p>"A-juan," she said to her daughter more than once, "I have no other hope in this life. Your father didn't leave me anything, but I, I can't not think of you. I'll borrow money to send you to school, so that you can make something of yourself in the future."</p>
<p>"Have we paid Uncle Zhang the 50,000 yuan?" her daughter asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"We've paid a total of 48,600 yuan in installments, and I don't know what to do to pay the rest," her mother said painfully. "Fortunately, Uncle Zhang is looking out for your deceased father, otherwise, who would let you bother them twenty or thirty times? You see, things are different with other people. When you try to reason with them a little, they act like it's a huge deal."</p>
<p>"Mom!" A-juan said tentatively, "I'll find a job. There's no point in going to school. Tuition is so expensive. Why borrow money to go to school? Besides, I can earn some income..."</p>
<p>"What kind of job is there to do these days? Besides, going to school is always good. You won't be afraid of not finding a job if you study! Besides, you're about to graduate from high school. Why bother trying to find a job just one year before? We haven't reached the point where we really can't afford tuition."</p>
<p>"Some of my classmates have opened a small school. I can go teach there."</p>
<p>"Why not wait until you graduate? You've worked hard for more than ten years, and you've finally made it to high school graduation. I can't let you complain in the future. Complain that your mother didn't let you study properly."</p>
<p>This lady's stubbornness should be forgiven. She had brought up her daughter with hardship and care, and sent her to school. She placed all her hopes on her daughter. Besides, why was she willing to keep that bangle even if she had to eat tree bark? Did she want to wear it herself? Mrs. He had always imagined that one day, she would also personally untie a delicate box tied with red and green silk threads, and put a pair of bangles on her daughter's wrists, letting that bangle shine brightly in front of many people.</p>
<p>She would keep this bangle until then, and save up some money to make a pair.</p>
<p>However, the house was gradually emptying out. Mrs. He could no longer exchange furniture for rice. She didn't care about firewood and rice. For her daughter, for that little bit of hope, Mrs. He could indeed eat tree bark if she had to. The problem was something else.</p>
<p>A-juan's tuition fees!</p>
<p>A-juan had applied for a scholarship from a newspaper office, and she could always find a way to make up for the insufficient amount. But this time, the difference was really big. The school stipulated that if the tuition fee was not paid by the end of May, she would not have a place in the next semester. This meant that Mrs. He had to pay another 20,000 yuan before the end of May.</p>
<p>Mrs. He wanted to discuss with the principal to pay later, but her daughter advised her not to do that kind of ineffective thing. She went to the homes of some relatives and friends, but before she could even open her mouth, they began to complain about their own poverty. It seemed that the heavens intentionally put all the poor people together. Of course, Mrs. He was too embarrassed to ask them for help, especially since she already owed them money.</p>
<p>"I'll, I'll find a job! I won't go to school!" her daughter said ruthlessly.</p>
<p>"No! Absolutely not! You're only one year away, don't change your mind!" Mrs. He said firmly.</p>
<p>But within a few days, she had to come up with 20,000 yuan. Moreover, within a few days, she had to buy two or three dou of rice, and some people would come to her to settle accounts – for example, the tailor, the sub-landlord, etc. In other words, in these few days, she had to come up with hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Her daughter went out to find a solution. Mrs. He sat in that empty house, sighing at her daughter's pile of books.</p>
<p>The landlady came in, not mentioning the rent, but first shouting:</p>
<p>"Mrs. He! Do you know what the price of gold is today? One million!"</p>
<p>Mrs. He shook her head along with her, indicating that these days were really terrible.</p>
<p>"That's why I say," the landlady said, "these days, whoever has one or two taels of gold will become rich. If I had that little bit of gold, humph! I'm not afraid to tell you, Mrs. He..."</p>
<p>Mrs. He suddenly thought of that bangle.</p>
<p>When she destroyed the first bangle fifteen years ago, she remembered the store telling her that it contained six qian of gold. The remaining one would of course be the same, so it would be worth 600,000 yuan!</p>
<p>Six hundred thousand! With that, everything would be taken care of, her daughter's tuition fees... She would have a way to cope, that bangle would be enough for everything.</p>
<p>But, could she bear to destroy that last bit of property she had?</p>
<p>That bangle, which had been with her for twenty years, which she originally wanted to let accompany her daughter until she was old, which she had once said she would keep even if she had to eat tree bark, could she destroy it now?</p>
<p>She planned to discuss it with her daughter again.</p>
<p>As soon as her daughter entered the door, she told her mother that she had met a classmate on the road, who said that she was the only one who had not paid the tuition fee. If she didn't pay it tomorrow, she shouldn't come to school next semester. Therefore, she was going to tell the school that she would not go to school...</p>
<p>"No, I'll pay!" Mrs. He interrupted her daughter hastily, deciding everything in that instant, "I'll go pay tomorrow, don't go say anything."</p>
<p>"The money?" her daughter asked, puzzled by her mother's excited emotions.</p>
<p>"I'll go destroy that bangle," Mrs. He said heavily.</p>
<p>Her daughter didn't respond, and both mother and daughter's eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>That night, Mrs. He and A-juan solemnly took out the red paper package from the handbag. Mrs. He stroked it with trembling hands, stroking it. Her daughter stood beside the table with her head lowered.</p>
<p>"A-juan, if you have money in the future, have another pair made," Mrs. He said softly, "I really didn't expect that even the last little bit of something couldn't be kept."</p>
<p>She felt that she couldn't think about the future anymore. The future, who knew what it would be like. But she felt sorry for her daughter, that even a gold bangle that had been kept for more than a decade couldn't be left for her. However, when she thought that this was for her daughter's tuition and school fees, Mrs. He felt relieved again, and she hadn't let her daughter down!</p>
<p>"This can be considered for her use," she thought, "I finally let her graduate from high school."</p>
<p>Walking out of that pawnshop, Mrs. He felt as if she had lost a heart at the same time.</p>
<h3>Wave</h3>
<p>— Huang Sha</p>
<p>There is no cheerful song, my throat seems to be blocked, I would rather bury my passion in silence.</p>
<p>There is no laughter, my innocence seems to be severed, I would rather fill my chest with hatred and confusion.</p>
<p>There is no hope, illusions are nothing more than a fabricated shadow, it is better not to exist at all, and immerse myself in inaction.</p>
<p>There is no heaven and earth, only a line of space that is too narrow and too dark is my own! The world is so vast, why did I fall into this deep abyss of mud?</p>
<p>Unbreakable worries; unsolvable sorrows; the pulse of this era has not yet ignited my own, I would rather be frozen in a sad curse and tear up my original beautiful dreams.</p>
<p>Do not look for love, do not look for leisure, this may only be swallowed by loneliness, my own blood and tears!</p>
<p>Do not seek tenderness, do not trust lightly, this may only be a spring of pain, only a waste of emotion, an erosion of youth.</p>
<p>I am young, but I have the heart of an old man. I no longer admire the happiness of others, no longer envy the success of others, I am only my own everything, everything depends only on my own hands and feet, plus my own reason, but without that childish enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I want to learn to be more mature, to forge myself to be stronger, to see things more realistically, to do things with my feet on the ground, to be tense and enthusiastic, to be busy and running around, to be healthy and stubborn.</p>
<p>The path of youth is ultimately different from that of old age, and also different from that of childhood. It is ultimately the most powerful path of this era. Walking and walking, I will walk the path I have grasped.</p>
<p>I will not be lonely, I will not get lost, I will not sink, because -</p>
<p>Relying on this courage alone, I firmly believe that many aspiring young people of this era are partners, albeit unfamiliar partners, but partners on the same path.</p>
<p>Isn't it so, my sincere friend? Tell me about it!</p>
<h3>Me and Society</h3>
<p>— Wu Kunming</p>
<p>I stepped out of the school gates and began to step into society.</p>
<p>The first step into society is, of course, finding a job. With my diligent and dedicated nature and spirit, I thought I would definitely find an ideal position.</p>
<p>So I busied myself, running around in society every day, for my own new life.</p>
<p>Our company intends to hire several employees. They must be hard-working and able to endure hardship, have no bad habits, and will be provided with food and lodging, in addition to a generous monthly salary. Interested parties should send a detailed resume with two recent half-body photos to Box No. ×× of this newspaper. If suitable, we will send a special letter to arrange an interview. Unsuitable applications will be returned. ×× Company</p>
<p>I read this advertisement several times over and over, carefully pondering each sentence. I felt that a golden opportunity had arrived. I have no bad habits, I am able to endure hardship, and "food and lodging provided, plus a generous monthly salary." Such treatment could not be considered bad.</p>
<p>I sat at my desk, picked up my small calligraphy brush, and wrote a letter of self-promotion without hesitation; every stroke on the letter was carefully written. I finished the letter, attached the photos inside, and then carefully sealed the envelope, affixed a stamp, taking a full hour. I placed all my hopes in this letter.</p>
<p>Filled with enthusiasm, I personally dropped the letter into the mailbox. Then I waited patiently at home, paying attention to the mailman every day. A week passed, no reply; ten days passed, no reply; half a month passed, still no reply. I began to suspect that the letter must have been written with the wrong mailbox number, or the post office had lost it.</p>
<p>Another month passed anxiously, and in the end, there was no news at all, as if it had sunk into the sea. Seeing that there was no hope, I gave up on this idea. But one afternoon, during a casual conversation at a friend's house, I finally understood the truth of the matter. It turned out that the company had already hired its staff before publishing the advertisement, and those employees were all friends or relatives of so-called important figures in the company. The advertisement published in the newspaper was merely a superficial formality. In reality, all the letters from a group of unemployed "interested parties" were discarded without even being looked at.</p>
<p>Understanding the stark "truth," I truly admired their cleverness. I had no resentment, no frustration, only hatred, hatred for this deceitful society.</p>
<p>I finally found a job at a trading company as a bookkeeper.</p>
<p>On my first day of work, I happily served with a sincere heart. I encouraged myself, comforted myself. I carefully sat in my chair, carefully held the pen, carefully recorded each number. I devoted my spirit and enthusiasm to this career.</p>
<p>Going out early and returning late every day, life was very disciplined, and entertainment and work were also balanced. Moreover, my daily duties also enriched me with much valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>But, something happened. One day, the company received a shipment of goods worth 800,000. As I was about to record it in the books with the invoice, the manager suddenly ran to my desk, and with a smile, quietly told me to write 1,000,000 in the cash section of the account. After hearing his "polite instruction," I immediately stood up to object. I said that it was clearly 800,000, how could I add 200,000? And the invoice also stated this. If the numbers were changed in the books, wouldn't that be inconsistent with the facts? Whose responsibility would it be if the accounts were audited in the future? But my words were to no avail. He insisted that I write 1,000,000. I argued with him for a long time, and a sense of responsibility and justice led me to the conclusion: I have no reason to do this! So I can't do this. As a result, things came to a standstill. In the end, he became angry, slammed the table, and told me to get out immediately. I am a straightforward person and could not yield like this. I gritted my teeth, and angrily exposed the secret of his intention, and I gave him a great lesson, I destroyed his dignity, tore off his mask, and then I strode out of that trading company.</p>
<p>On the way home, I felt both hatred and pleasure. The pleasure was that I had so boldly lectured a manager, the hatred was for the hypocrisy and meanness of this society.</p>
<p>After these two setbacks, I not only did not become depressed because of unemployment but instead increased my courage to challenge unreasonable things and gained a deeper understanding of society.</p>
<p>Through a very fortunate opportunity, I joined a bank. I never thought that I would actually do this so-called "golden rice bowl" job.</p>
<p>Spinning around in calculators, bills, ledgers, and cash every day, but I didn't feel tired. On the contrary, I was very happy because my life was finally stable here.</p>
<p>A year passed peacefully. In this year, I spent several so-called "once a year" festivals. Every year during the holidays, colleagues were busy buying seasonal items. I curiously asked them why, and they all showed surprised and embarrassed expressions and said to me, "There's no choice! It's for gift-giving." I couldn't help but be stunned, wondering to myself: Is gift-giving really an "unavoidable" practice? But the reality was clearly presented before my eyes. For the sake of their jobs, for the sake of their future, for the sake of winning the favor of their superiors, yes, there was no choice, they had to give gifts.</p>
<p>But, exceptionally, I did not give gifts during the holidays. My stubborn nature forbade me from doing something that "I had no choice" about. I wanted to see what would happen.</p>
<p>The second year began, and of course, the first to come was New Year's Day. As usual, there was some restructuring in the bank: some were laid off, some were promoted, and some were transferred. On the third day of my vacation, I received a letter from the bank. I opened it and, sure enough, as I expected, the bank laid me off for "cost-saving" reasons. Ha! Not even thirteen months!</p>
<p>Tearing up the letter, I felt nothing else. I only had hatred! Hatred for this snobbish society.</p>
<p>Society, a society where gold is everywhere. Is society beautiful? I can't say, I can only sigh.</p>
<p>Everywhere is filled with deception, hypocrisy, meanness, and darkness. There is no place for me to stand in society; there is no place for a young, honest, talented, and spirited "ignorant of the times" young man to stand.</p>
<p>I hate this selfish and self-serving society. I can't get sympathy and help, and all I receive is a series of mocking and contemptuous sneers. Like a lonely traveler in a desert, all around me is a vast desert that disappoints me.</p>
<p>But, I am stubborn!</p>
<p>I am not desperate, I am even more not depressed, I still have a pair of strong arms, I still have a strong body, I still have a rebellious soul. Let the shadows of the past die. Although I have failed, I am still at war with society to see who will conquer whom? I just live so stubbornly, living to turn over a new page in my life.</p>
<h3>Night Watchman's Call</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xing</p>
<p>Midnight, boundless darkness. In the vast silence, the mouth of the alley vibrates with a desolate night watchman’s call. Sparsely, it resembles the faint bell of an ancient temple in the remote countryside, spreading heart-stirring sound waves after the drumbeat.</p>
<p>In this lonely midnight, we crave the night watchman’s call. It lets us know that even in this long darkness, there is still the dim lamp of the night watchman, and at the end of the night watchman’s call, there is dawn, which the sleepless yearn for.</p>
<h3>Deception</h3>
<p>— Wo Chuan</p>
<p>Spring has arrived. I counted, Lin has been gone for three years.</p>
<p>I remember, at that time, Lin and Li and I became the best classmates because of our compatible personalities.</p>
<p>Li had a wealthy family and was a gentle and innocent young man. Lin, on the other hand, had been drifting outside since he was a child. His gaunt face seemed to be smeared with a layer of desolate wind and dust, but he was younger than Li.</p>
<p>Whenever school was out or during holidays, Li always invited us to his house to play. But I had a quirk, which was that I felt uneasy whenever I went to wealthy people’s homes, so I rarely accepted the invitation. But Lin was the opposite of me, perhaps the years of wandering made him think of the happiness of having a home, not to mention that Li’s home was so warm. In this way, Lin and Li became even closer.</p>
<p>Sometimes under the lamp at dusk, in a small and exquisite room filled with warmth, the three of us sat knee to knee, and casual conversation would burst forth spontaneously. This laughter and conversation would continue until late at night, and I would happily walk home, while Lin would often be asked to stay overnight.</p>
<p>But Lin was a bit proud and unwilling to be treated coldly. After discovering a couple of times that Li’s family seemed to dislike him, he was no longer happy to agree to Li’s requests to stay overnight. And because of his repeated rejections, Li often felt inexplicable disappointment and confusion in his heart.</p>
<p>The reason why Lin was disliked by Li’s family was probably because he was becoming increasingly poor! His complexion became more sallow, and his clothes also became tattered. When Li saw him like this, he often wanted to help him financially, but he rarely accepted. Lin also began to realize that his social class was very different from Li’s. Although he still maintained a good friendship with Li, he was no longer as persistent and enthusiastic as before. He became more depressed and quietly grieved himself.</p>
<p>On the day before the winter vacation, Li invited Lin and me to his house, as if to say goodbye, but Lin still locked his thick eyebrows, looked at us with lifeless eyes, as if he had endless thoughts he wanted to tell us, but he finally didn’t say a word, and finally left very early.</p>
<p>He didn’t come to see us during the winter vacation. We went to his house, but some other people lived there. It turned out that they had moved.</p>
<p>When school started, Lin didn’t come again. Later, we received a letter from him, with only a few words, telling us that he had dropped out of school today.</p>
<p>With one less person among the three of us, the days became more lonely, especially for Li, who completely changed his innocent and carefree habits and was dispirited for a long time. I comforted him, saying that Lin would definitely come to see us soon, but he said with certainty: “Lin is a very stubborn person. When he loves you, he loves you with all his heart; when he hates you, he hates you with all his heart.” I said, “He will never hate us.” Li said, “Just watch.”</p>
<p>However, to Li’s surprise, Lin actually came to his house on a spring holiday.</p>
<p>His eyes were full of red streaks, his cheekbones were high, and his face was covered with the dark shadows of life. He was wearing blue overalls stained with oil, and his arm was wrapped in a piece of black cloth.</p>
<p>“My father died last month. I can’t forget his eyes looking at me eagerly when he died, as if he was instructing me to take on the responsibility of the family from now on. Now I work and earn a little pitiful wage to support my family. I will never have a day like you to study again!”</p>
<p>In order not to make him sad, we all welcomed him happily. We asked him to stay overnight, and this time he agreed very readily.</p>
<p>Li sincerely asked him if he needed some money, saying that a small amount would definitely not be a problem. Lin just shook his head firmly. So Li simply took out some money and stuffed it into his pocket, saying: “If you still acknowledge that I am your good friend, you should accept it.”</p>
<p>He quickly and angrily threw it back to Li, saying with a dignified tone:</p>
<p>“I have no reason to accept your money. I admit that you are my best friend, but there is an invisible membrane between us, and this membrane can definitely not be removed by this method.”</p>
<p>That night, Lin and I both stayed in Li’s bedroom.</p>
<p>But what was strange was that after that day, Li’s attitude towards me suddenly changed. He gradually became distant from me, looked askance at me, and often spied on me in secret. This situation lasted for a month or so. I really couldn’t bear it anymore, so one day I solemnly asked him: “Do you have any doubts about me? Please tell me directly!”</p>
<p>He pretended to be surprised to look at me, and then denied it.</p>
<p>I couldn’t figure out why he suspected me. I racked my brains to reflect on myself, but I still couldn’t get anything. Finally, I thought: Why do I have to get along with you? Since you suspect me, let’s just separate. So we gradually became not good friends anymore. But, one day, Li suddenly ran over and handed me a letter, gasping for breath and saying, “Look, look! Lin would actually do this! …” Then he said to me in a forgiving voice: “Please forgive my past.”</p>
<p>I hurriedly unfolded Lin’s letter, which read as follows:——</p>
<p>“… I am the biggest liar! I deceived the friend who trusted me the most, and I also deceived my conscience! My conscience is urging me every day, and I have to tell you this. That is: on the night of our reunion, I stole your money and ring. Will you be stunned when you see this? Yes, you will never think that I did this, because you have always given me the greatest trust! What words can I use to cover up my ugliness? None! I can only say to you that I suffered from the harm of “pride”! That night you gave me money, how could I not need it? Can I bear to watch my mother and younger siblings cry to me with empty stomachs? However, I look down on money, and I look down on friendship represented by money, so I rejected you. But thinking about the future life, the life locked up in hell, I once again understood the power of money! But since I have already rejected you, how can I open my mouth to you again? Later, I remembered the watch and ring you put under your pillow, and I touched them confusedly and stuffed them into my pocket! … This matter will cause me pain for a lifetime. What good is mere repentance? I cannot ask for your forgiveness, I only hope that you will forget me forever in the long days to come! …”</p>
<p>Oh, so that’s how it is! No wonder Li was so suspicious of me those days?</p>
<p>This is a brand, deeply engraved in Lin’s pure dew.</p>
<p>The facts made me understand: In this unequal society, there are places that people in different positions can never understand each other, even if they are the best of friends.</p>
<p>I still cherish the friendship he gave me in the past; but since then, I have lost him.</p>
<p>It’s the spring of the third year. Will the spring breeze bring me news of him?</p>

<h3>Tomorrow's Charity Soccer Match: How Should White Horse Fight Overseas Chinese Association?</h3>
<p>The second charity soccer match to raise education funds, sponsored by the Football Association, will be held tomorrow at the Happy Valley field. It will be a second meeting between White Horse and Overseas Chinese Association. These two teams met during the eighth welfare match. With the superb skills of both teams, it created a heated situation. This time, the two teams bravely fight for the education fund, which is commendable. The great attraction is naturally expected, and the benefits to the education fund are not small!</p>
<p>White Horse Borrowing Troops, Embracing the Determination to Win</p>
<p>Recently, the departure of Sun Jinshun from Shanghai and the injury of Li Yao have affected the strength of the White Horse team. But Mr. Cheng Bo'an, the main backbone of the team, has the determination to win, so he has borrowed Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, and Luo Shoufu from the United Association. The difference between gains and losses is still minimal. At that time, there will be ideal results.</p>
<p>After the White Horse team invited the soldiers from the Liaison, they still lack left-wing personnel, so it is worth studying how to allocate the lineup. My personal opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>White Horse First Lineup</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuang Youren Yongfu Li Yichen</p>
<p>Bang Fu Dai Qing</p>
<p>Lun Zhang Lin'gen Song Sheng Han Longhai</p>
<p>The above-mentioned lineup is considered to take into account both offense and defense. After the vanguard lacks A-Sun and Li Yao, there is always the regret that it is difficult to be complete. In terms of technology, Li Yichen and Wu Qixiang are the only ones. Because the Overseas Chinese Association goalkeeper's skills are extraordinary and his skills are agile. In addition to the feet, they must also have experience, intelligence, and the ability to defend against assassination, so Li Yichen has extremely fast, tricky, and strong feet. Wu Qixiang has repeatedly acted as a winger in the past, and his sprinting power and diagonal shots have excellent performances, and should not be disappointing. The distribution of the central defense line is considered ideal. Song. Xin. Qu. are all good. On the defender side, Lin Gen must retreat. Fortunately, Youren has been in good condition recently, and the old partner will not make much mistakes. With the strength of the central defense line, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Zhang Banglun's skills as a goalkeeper have always had remarkable results, and he can handle it happily, there should be no objection.</p>
<p>White Horse Second Lineup Zhang Wu Qixiang Yongfu Li Yichen Bang Fu Dai Qing Lun Zhang Lin'gen Song Sheng Han Longhai</p>
<p>Mai Youliang</p>
<p>The above-mentioned lineup uses Qi Xiang as a defender to conform to his recent position. Once transferred, or may not be able to catch up, avoid trying, and still kick in the original position, so as to exert its peak performance. And the rear defense is also impeccable. In the position of left wing, there is nothing to do, but to use the young general Luo Shoufu. According to Luo kicking inside forward, there is quite something to be desired. He once tried the left wing, but he was incompatible. I don't know if he can be slightly satisfactory recently?</p>
<p>In general, the above-mentioned two lineups are comprehensive. But the biggest shortcoming of the front line is that on the front line, it is hopeless to get the ball, and the strength is also sufficient. But it is difficult to expect the five forwards of Donghua to cooperate tacitly, and the lens will be inferior.</p>
<h3>Tactical Discussion</h3>
<p>Now, in order to hope that White Horse will win again, I will make a brief tactical discussion.</p>
<p>The lineup and application methods of the Overseas Chinese Association seem to be fixed, so White Horse should have a prior plan.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about defense. No matter what lineup White Horse uses, there should be a mutual hint between the left forward and the left defender to prevent the opponent's right forward and right wing. It is necessary to change the style of attack. Therefore, the left side goalkeeper should die, and cut it off. The welcome of the two, and then to prevent their personal vitality, may be obtained. Secondly, the opponent's Tekni center is quite capable of attacking the city. Only the old and tired, I am afraid Tekni will have no way to enter. The Overseas Chinese Association's left forward and left wing are sometimes made up of Ba Ma as the inner forward, Di Pannadu as the wing, and Sheng Yatuomali as the left wing in the chaos. But as a change, neither has the development of expertise, and the situation is also under normal circumstances, and there is not much threat. The most important thing to pay attention to in the defense method is the layout inside the stadium in the residential area. Otherwise, the old general will suddenly use a cold arrow, how can the guest ignore it.</p>
<p>If talking about the way of attack, the reporter has repeatedly said that the Overseas Chinese Association's guard, whether it is the central guard line and the rear guard, is trapped in the rigid method of parallel style. Following the shadow of the ball, it will be front or back. This method is fortunate that its physical strength is sufficient, and there are few loopholes. Otherwise, the enemy's front attack is extremely easy. The way to break it is to use short pass migration more, or make V-shaped and W-shaped advances, then he will inevitably have the worry of forgetting the rear. More than that, White Horse has a special attack method, that is, the use of Longhai's fierce scurry may not be enough to threaten the rear guard with its dull method, that is, the goalkeeper is the most difficult to be overcome. And Longhai at this time on the left side of the front and wing should pay the most attention to standing in the best position to attack the goal. You should use the cover of the Longhai army, and the Young Army aircraft will pick left, sitting and attacking the opportunity. In this way, the Overseas Chinese Association will have no way to deal with it.</p>
<p>The season has entered early summer, and football is not suitable. But the Football Association authorities have made this wonderful competition invitation for charitable purposes, as well as the players' competition in the summer heat, all of which are worthy of our admiration</p>
<h3>Strengthening Friendship and Overcoming Portuguese Merchants</h3>
<p>Last Sunday, the friendship and Portuguese merchant football teams played their first match to raise educational funds for the Football Association. Due to a minor dispute between the two teams in the league's A division, the appeal was unexpectedly good. It's a pity that the sun was too harsh for the fans that day. I wonder if future morning matches will be held earlier or moved to the afternoon? Otherwise, I think it might affect ticket sales.</p>
<p>Before the game, everyone thought there would be a very exciting battle between the two sides, even a performance that would raise the standard. The result was disappointing. To put it simply, the friendship team seemed to win as easily as if they had encountered a weak team. Nevertheless, the friendship team finally vented its anger. However, many nervous people may think this was a predetermined plan for both Portuguese merchant team members. I dare not believe it, and I hope it is not true. Now, let's get back to evaluating that battle.</p>
<p>We might as well first look at the points where the Portuguese merchants did not perform well, which is that although they used very well-matched athletes, they did not do it according to the proper method. For example, when central defender Oliveira got the ball, the best opportunity at that time was V. If. Usually, he would have quickly and skillfully relayed it, but that day he insisted on passing it to Vaughn, who was being closely guarded, so everything was over. Their offense and defense looked very hard, but in fact, they accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>Looking at the friendship team's performance that day, no matter what tricks the opponent used, they were always successful. It was clear that Li Yichen, Fei Chunhua, and Xu Wenkui in the friendship frontline all had some unfamiliarity or lack of stamina. But in this battle, all three of them had enough energy. Except for Li Yichen's occasional laziness, of course, scoring two goals against the other team was not accidental. In particular, it was highly possible that the friendship team would win five or six goals that day.</p>
<p>In terms of defense, because the Portuguese merchants did not have the best offense, there was not much effort needed. However, everyone's footwork was clean and their spirits were high, showing the friendship team's revitalization. Wu Qixiang, who had not been seen for a long time and had always been eliminated, showed his heroic posture and powerful shots, which were indeed worth appreciating.</p>
<p>For the sake of cherishing the friendship team's sudden rise and revitalization, let's say a few more words.</p>
<p>In the early stage of this year's league, the friendship team defeated the ambitious Overseas Chinese Union, which excited every domestic fan. Because the friendship team was not doing well last year. In the midst of the fans' distant wishes, the team worked hard to improve, concentrated on accommodation, and practiced on schedule. In this situation, we were looking forward to the team's final success. Unexpectedly, in the subsequent matches, they suffered draws with the German merchants and the Shanghai police. Although victory or defeat is common in military affairs, in fact, the friendship team did not achieve the results that people imagined. By the end, when they had a decisive battle with the Portuguese merchants, it ended unhappily, so everyone sighed. At the same time, they were worried about the future of the friendship team. Unexpectedly, at this time of the season, the team revitalized its remaining strength, reorganized, improved, and worked hard on football, showing the spirit of its heyday. Sure enough, in this battle to defeat the Portuguese merchants, we can be convinced. But I cannot help but hope that they will persist to the end, and their future will definitely be recorded in the history of football. Encourage them! Encourage them!</p>
<h3>Volleyball League: The Situation of the Two Women's Groups in Group A</h3>
<p>The volleyball league has been competing for two weeks since it started. Because there are more teams in Group B, and their quality is uneven, there is still little clarity for the time being. However, in the two women's groups in Group A, the first round has been completed, and the great battle of the second round has now begun. To win the championship and fight for fame, there will definitely be a more tense situation. Here is a description of the situation of the women's group A, and a grand outlook for the second round. First, let's talk about Group A.</p>
<p>Group A</p>
<p>In this year's league, the author has already stated in the last issue of this publication that Zhongbei is sure to win the Group A championship. Looking at their performance in the first round, they easily defeated Three Provinces in the first battle, defeated Huayan, and then defeated the White Team, without spending much effort. Then, in the second round, everything will go smoothly, and there will be no problems. As for the runner-up seat, according to the current situation, Three Provinces has a large share. However, the White Team was completely defeated in the first round, but in terms of their strength, they should not be so miserable. There will definitely be unexpected good results in the second round. If the White Team can defeat Three Provinces and Huayan, the situation will change. When Huayan first played against the White Team, they were able to win with the help of foreign generals Gutange and Qiaoqi. After fighting with Zhongbei, only one person, Qi, was seen, and their strength was greatly reduced. When they faced Three Provinces, none of the foreign generals arrived, and it was even more difficult to defeat them. Therefore, in the second round, if there are no foreign generals to help, I am afraid they will not be the enemy of the White Team. If so, the special seat will most likely be taken by the White Team and Huayan.</p>
<p>Women's Group Because there are too few teams, Three Provinces, an old hand, is sure to win the championship steadily. In the first round, they defeated Xinben and Huayan one after another with ease. In both games, their power was not fully displayed. In the second round, Xinben and Huayan will definitely have better results, so Three Provinces may be slightly threatened in addition to winning, so that the team can have more opportunities to perform.</p>
<p>The competition for the ranking of the women's group is only in the battle between Xinben and Huayan in the second round. In theory, since Xinben has already won, they will meet again with the mentality of "he is my defeated general," and they will be able to go straight to Huanglong and compete for the second place. The former should be slightly brave in the three-row and two-corner formation, and there is no need to doubt it. Wang Wuli in the second row should retreat slightly and grab more balls in the backcourt. It is better for them to grab each other without losing than to lose by giving way to each other. If they can do this, it will not be difficult to defeat China. On the other hand, thinking for Huayan, it is also to stand side by side with Xinben in second place, that is, to carry the yellow bag on their backs. Moreover, as a historical team, it is necessary to avenge the defeat to a rising army. Therefore, Huayan hopes that veteran players such as Zhu Wenpei and Zhang Bianyue should all play, and that there should be extremely important work for the scheduling of positions and the receipt of confidential guidance. If not, it is expected that they will be defeated by Xinben again, and they will also be sure to carry the yellow bag this year.</p>
<h3>The Huiqing Cup Will Open, and the Ping Pong Teams Are Active</h3>
<p>The Huiqing Cup Table Tennis League is about to open, and the participating teams are very active. Here is a record of the current situation of each team.</p>
<p>Rong Deneng, a master of chopping balls, has prepared for the revival of the Guangdong Table Tennis Association, which has been completed. He has specially hired the giants of the industry, Yu Jing, Xu Renshan, and Li Yanlu, to serve as chairmen and leaders, respectively, to facilitate the process. Rong himself serves as the team leader and has joined the Huiqing Cup Group A table tennis competition. Players such as Ouyang Wei, Fang Keping, Huang Guanrong, Zheng Jia, Deng Xiurong, and Li Peiran are all famous Guangdong table tennis players in Shanghai with strong strength and high voices for winning the championship.</p>
<p>Mao Songting, the chairman of the Heren Table Tennis Association, initiated the Huiqing Cup Table Tennis League this time. In addition to donating all the prizes, he also bears all the expenses. His enthusiasm for promoting the sport is admirable. In addition to hiring eleven competition committee members to preside over the competition, all other matters are handled by five players: Xue Xuchu, Wang Youxin, Huang Zhi, Wang Changhou, and Ji Fang. The work efficiency of the cup competition has been greatly increased.</p>
<p>The all-around veteran Lu Hanhou has been busy developing his business since he started running the Zhonghua Table Tennis Room and has been neglecting practice. But once he gets on the court, he still plays with great style, which is also a talent. Lu has decided to serve for the Jiufeng team this time. Jiufeng is organized by two prominent figures in the silk industry, Du Zhenzi and Du Limin. The team is managed by the athletes Han Dewei and Zhang Junyuan as team leaders and administrators. It is heard that a team meeting will be held soon to decide on the official list of players attending the Huiqing Cup. It is also heard that Zhang Ying, a good chopper in the team, may withdraw.</p>
<p>The White Team Table Tennis Team is organized by gathering elites from various schools. Dai Qifeng, a giant in the pearl and basketball industry, serves as the leader. They have young players such as Hu Peikang, Dai Huigen, Liu Ruien, Liu Jiarong, Jiang Baiquan, Du Huimin, Li Xi, Cheng Zhizhi, and Cheng Wanzhu, who are very brave. The team has signed up for the Huiqing Cup Group B, and their hope of winning the championship is very high. Their only opponent is the Green Team Table Tennis Team. When the two heroes meet in the future, they will inevitably</p>
<p>The newly established Tanyou Table Tennis Team is jointly initiated and organized by Zhu Anming, Chen Chaozhang, , Zhu Liangda, Tang Chang, and Wu Guanying, who are the best players in the city. The team has no experience in table tennis competitions, but they are determined to fight to the end. Therefore, they decided to join the Huiqing Cup Group B in order to improve.</p>
<h3>Questions about the Basketball Group B Finals</h3>
<p>The finals of the Basketball League Group B were originally scheduled to be completely concluded last month. Unexpectedly, due to the dispute in the preliminary round of the finals between the Pegasus and Zhenyuan teams, there has been no follow-up. It is really puzzling! If the protest filed by Zhenyuan is justified, they should be allowed to replay the game. If their protest is unreasonable, then Pegasus should be declared the winner and play a rematch with the Dragon Army according to the rules. However, the authorities have been silent for more than ten days, making the outstanding teams eager to see through their eyes. (Xundou)</p>
<h3>Introduction to the World of Football and Basketball</h3>
<p>La Sha's "My Experience"</p>
<p>La Sha, a famous Portuguese football player, has been playing on the Shanghai field for as long as twenty years. In the era of the Blue Devils, his right inside forward was comparable to the King of Balls, Li Huitang. The magic he had was second to none. He is now the coach of the Portuguese Merchant Football Team. The Portuguese Merchant team today is only trained properly by Mr. Ke. Mr. Ke rarely writes articles. Recently, in response to the invitation of the "Sports World Society," he wrote an article "My Experience" for the "World of Football and Basketball," giving valuable guidance to new players and veteran players on their experience.</p>
<p>The "World of Football and Basketball" has been preparing for a month. In addition to Mr. Ke's article, there is also Mr. Liang Zhaoan's "Outline of New Basketball Movement," which describes the offensive and defensive strategies of new basketball in detail, and adds humorous pictures to life. There are also works by Mr. Shixiang on football and Taijiquan, as well as works by Mr. Huibisai and Dongfeng, which are full of dazzling and beautiful things. As for the results of football and basketball games in the past two years, the collection is also detailed, which is especially necessary for reference. The book is scheduled to be published and distributed tomorrow. The whole book is a thick volume of more than 60,000 words, and the price is 1,500 yuan. It is sold by newspaper stands. A special introduction is given above.</p>
