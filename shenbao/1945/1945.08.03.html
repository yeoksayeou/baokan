<h3>日陸海空軍結成一體準備發揮決戰力台灣亦完成萬全戰鬥態勢</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日大本營一日發表帝國海陸軍逐步增强決戰態勢，其意義極爲重大，由是可見帝國陸海軍之新之決意，實爲空前之重大聲明。前鈴木首相接見記者時聲明謂，參謀總長及軍令部長曾解釋，「目前戰局乃軍方之所期待者」，使全國民衆感銘殊深，前之首相聲明及此次政府發表，皆可見日軍部在茲激烈戰同下，毅然本此重大方針，逐步增强戰備之實情，蓋作戰之要諦，決非徒使兵力陸續派駐前方，乃在舉所有決戰兵力進行戰鬥，於必要時本一舉而盡數出動，以決定勝利。日本作戰根本方針，皆本此原則進行，日軍處茲連日敵空襲之下，一再隱忍，自動以全力準備本土決戰，以待戰機成熟，俟軍方命令降下，即將發揮日軍所準備之決戰兵力，斯時於陸海空三方面，必可使敵遭受戰略上空前大損害也。敵軍將於何地登陸，現尙不能臆測，然日方利用本土之地利，隨時隨地發動機動兵力，而國內各機場亦充前綫基地，對敵抗戰，今日海睦空軍完全結成一體，必可一舉覆滅驅敵也。</p>
<p>西南前綫基地二日中央社電美軍如於次期作戰向大陸方面進擊，則台灣於戰略上所佔之地位極爲重要，是以當雷伊泰戰綫展開後，台灣全島即將萬全之戰鬥態勢準備完成。本年沉寂敵軍於仁牙因登陸之時，已卡是襲擊轟炸台灣，至今已有半年餘，但仍一日不停繼續攻擊主要都市，而竟對部落疎開地等亦加轟炸，然台灣人力物力之强靱，斷非馬尼刺與沖繩等可比，因是敵軍乃不直接觸犯台灣，僅有每日之轟炸，企圖減低其戰力，但台灣已完成自給自足態勢，絕未因冲繩戰鬥告終而稍受牽制，敵軍之次期作戰，是否於台灣登陸則並不明瞭，然無論情勢如何，台灣之陸海空軍部隊，與七百萬之島民，業已完全整備該島之一切防術設施，現入於於備戰鬥態勢中。</p>
<h3>日軍制空部隊展開邀擊戰　隊毀來襲美機卅八架</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電一日夜迄二日晨，美機除來襲日本富山。長岡·八王子·水戶·川崎。鶴見各地區外，並以B29型襲擊宇治。山田。立川各市，來襲機數累計達六百架，日軍制空部隊迎擊之戰果，迄二日晨經判明者，計擊落十一架，擊破二十七架。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電B29型機約三百餘架，一日下午九時許，從房總·伊豆兩半島方面波狀侵入日本土，以富山·長岡·八王子·川崎·橫濱市鶴見區及茨城縣之水戶市爲主要目標，投下燒夷彈及炸彈，迄二日上午三時左右，逐次向南方洋上挽去，日方制空部隊當時展開邀擊戰，獲得相當戰果，詳細情形現正調查中。</p>
<p>大阪二日中央社電二日正午左右，P51型約四十架，由三重縣一部及愛知·歧　·奈良一縣而侵入阪神地區，另有P51型十五架次，來襲滋賀縣中南部，大阪西南部，各對航空基地交通機關加以攻擊。</p>
<h3>九州地區邀擊戰果</h3>
<p>福岡二日中央社電　上月三十日來製九州地區之敵機，日軍制空部隊之邀擊戰果，計擊落大型小型機各一架，擊破大型三架，小型機二架。</p>
<p>福岡二日中央社電冲繩基地敵小型機約八十架，B29型機六十架之轟炸戰鬥聯合編隊，於一日上午十一時許來襲長崎縣及鹿兒島縣，對機場，船舶，軍需設施加以轟擊，又三十一日來襲九州之敵機，總計約達三百架。</p>
<h3>北海道及大島先後遭砲擊</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電</p>
<p>一日下午二時半許，敵潛艦三艘對北海道樣似施行艦砲射擊，日方損害極輕微。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電美機動部隊之艦上機，一日晨迄十時左右，以小編隊來襲伊豆大島，同時敵巡洋艦一艘，驅遂艦三艘駛近該島，施行艦砲射擊。</p>
<h3>日航空部隊佛曉攻擊　冲繩機塲起火</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電日航空部隊三十一日拂　攻擊沖繩敵軍地區及周圖之敵艦船，敵機塲九處起火，擊毀敵艦型不明者一艘及遝輸船一艘。</p>
<h3>空襲激化極需戒備</h3>
<p>前綫航空基地二日中央社電　沖繩基地連日出動飛機四百七十架至五百架，來襲九州地區，漸次擴展其行動圈，上月二十四·五兩日，與機動部隊連繫，一部於中國地區，更於二十九日有P51型，B25型行動於南朝鮮，由此敵機之行動狀况判斷，其行動半徑逐次擴大，勢屬必至。又可判斷B24型·B25型·P51型，P38型之戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊之行動，可能半徑爲一千二百公里程度，故以此來襲中國地方及阪神地區事屬可能，今後對由該基地出發之戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊愈益激化之來襲，極需嚴密戒備。</p>
<h3>本年下半年度收支總概算　昨日中政會決議通過</h3>

<h3>馬加蕯被炸死傷數百人</h3>
<p>馬加薩二日中央社電一日上午十時二十分許，B24型機十三架，侵入馬加薩郊外，對印度納西亞及華僑農民部落集中投下炸彈，燒夷彈數百枚，致原住民有多數死傷，至現在止查明死七十名，傷二百名，呈極悲慘之盡面，遭此美機惡　無道爆炸之地方，爲離馬加蕯三公里之原住民部落，印度納西亞及華僑切　憤恨，益堅同仇敵愾之鬥志。</p>

<h3>五宣傳團體聯合茶會迎送　松平勝野兩書記官</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會·中國廣播協會·中華電影公司·雜誌聯合會，小型報聯合會等五團體，於昨（二）日下午五時半，特聯合舉行茶會，歡送松平前情報部長，並歡迎新任弘報部勝野書記官，同時邀請南京大使館岸情報部長蒞會，計到五團體代表及各報社記者，尾坂與市·赤星爲光·森山喬·金雄白·陳日平·許力求·袁殊·陳彬龢·戴麟藻·張石川·魯風·王雪塵等百餘人。行禮如儀後，首由中國新聞協會上海區分會理事長陳彬龢致詞，繼由松平勝野兩先生答詞，旋由岸情報部長致詞，最後並由影星白光·利靑雲·吳驚鴻小姐歌唱，情緒極爲歡洽，至七時許賓主始盡歡而散。</p>
<h3>主席致詞</h3>
<p>五團體代表陳彬　致迎送詞：「今天舉行茶會的意義有兩個：第一對於前大使館松平部長一年半來對於我們多方協力，表示感謝，表示惜別。第二，歡迎新組織的弘報部松平書記官德繼任者勝野書記官，勝野書記官原來服務南京大使館情報部，一向與我們有間接的關係，帮助我們很多，現在來到上海，對於我們必有更多的指導，更多的協力。最近現地盟邦陸海大使館三個報道機關改組爲弘報部，使報道工作一元化，這一點是我們非常欽佩的。今天在座南京大使館岸參事官將在上海弘報部中，担任主要的指導職務，我們亦表示歡迎。今後時局一天天緊張，我們從事宣傳的機構，也應當趨向於集中力量，減少浪費，謀配合當局指導戰道一元化。」</p>
<h3>松平致詞</h3>
<p>松平書記官謝詞：「今日承五宣傳團體歡送，深爲感謝，本人於年二月抵滬，閱時一載有半，其間在座諸君情感頗爲密切，但在任期內，毫無建樹，殊深內疚。本人肅主欲謀取中日兩國之親善，及相互瞭解，必須以噸陸邦交，增厚友激烈之時，兩國間之關擊，益應緊密保持，深望各位今後在公私雙方，仍予多多指教，同時並請對勝野書記官亦於同樣之協助。」</p>
<h3>勝野謝詞</h3>
<p>勝野書記官謝詞：「松平部長在任期內，頗多攻擊，此次榮調北平服務，本人奉命繼任，深懼不克勝任。此次日在滬陸海外三報道機構實行合倂一元化，其主旨不求表面工作，而謀實際之發展，本人今後常努力奉行，以達成此目的，同時尙祈諸君不吝協力及指敎，今承盛大招待，曷勝感謝。」</p>
<h3>岸氏致詞</h3>
<p>暗參事官致詞：「日本有成語謂：「不言勝於多言」，但主席陳彬　先生頃對此次上海弘報部之設立，提及本人，於是不得不起作簡單答覆。本人之參加弘報部工作，不足輕重，二年前，赴京任職以來，承南京各關係方面密切協力，如今旣在京滬兩地服務，祗有彼此兼顧從事工作，務請京滬各方不時指敎，協助本人完成任務。」</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>關於空襲救護救濟工作</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>最近敵機已有多日未來本市肆虐，傳聞太平洋上正有颶風，因而受阻，絕非市上一般人神經過敏的揣測，敵機決不會對滬人放鬆，我們不能因敵機暫時受阻於氣候，而忽略了警覺性。因此，我想對於本市空襲救護救濟工作，貢獻一些意見：</p>
<p>本市市民防空本部，是市府方面負責防空救護救濟的實施機構，（當然這是防空本部一部分工作，其他工作不在本文範圍，故不論及），市民福利協會空襲救濟委員會是民問方面的救護救濟團體。市民防空本部成立已久，對於防空救護救濟工作，已有詳細的計畫與相當的準備，但還沒有達到最理想的地步，正需要民間力量予以協助。最近本市屢次遭遇空襲後，民間即自動發起組織救護救濟團體，各界踴躍轍捐，這是極可欣慰的舉動。</p>
<p>在本星期二日，繼七月十八日市民福利會空襲救濟委員會與市府關係當局舉行聯絡會議以後，我曾與市府胡副秘書長，防空本部野口總務處長，對於定襲救護救濟工作交換意見。官民雙方的目的，在於空襲時之救護救濟工作，如何可得較大效率。我們的結諭，救護救濟工作，必須官方與民間密切聯絡，才能收指臂之效。第一，熱心推動救濟救護工作的人，必先認識：市民防空本部是發號施令的實施機構‘市民福利會空襲救濟會是集中民間救護救濟的力量，調整民間團體的組織，受防空本部指揮而工作的民間機構。因爲防空本部在空襲時有最迅速的情報，與當地的軍警有非常密切的聯擊，所以，必須由它發號施令。因爲市民福利協會，原是爲市民謀福利的機稱，所以，必須由它担任集中及調整民間力量及組織。</p>
<p>第二，我們必須更認識，目前物資是最感困難的時期，絲奄不容浪費，雖一尺紗布一塊棉花也不能浪費。官民機構有了密切聯　以後，我們能够服從官方指揮，能够集中民間力量，才能做到不浪費，才能做到事半功倍。我們有了然心還是不够，更須服從指揮，尤其在空襲的時候，市民福利會集中與調整工作，並不是統制或是管理，而是把管方與民間的力量聯繫起來。最近市民福利協會聞理事長，爲期促進官民聯藥工作，經指定顧南羣先生擔任醫藥組方面與防空本部的聯絡工作，陳日平先生擔任救濟組方面的聯絡工作。因此，民間其他組織方面，應分別與市民福利會醫藥組及救濟組發生聯繫。</p>
<p>我們還得重複的說：</p>
<p>防空本部竭誠歡迎民間自動的救濟救護工作。</p>
<p>戰時人力物力的困難，不容浪費，工作不容重複，必須有組織有計畫的推動，尤其空襲救濟救護工作。</p>
<p>爲達到第二項，必先把民間力量集中與調整，然後能與防空本部取得協力。</p>
<p>敵機的來擊與擴大肆虐，均極可能，我們千萬不能有一時一刻的鬆弛，隨時隨地嚴密防範，俾可減少損害。</p>
<h3>波次坦會議結束三國將發表聲明　傳美總統擬會唔英王</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電　據波次坦電，三頭會談已於一日下午完畢，會談結果之聲明，將於華盛頓，倫敦·莫斯科三首都同時發表之，美總統特魯曼本定於會談後乘飛機返國，現傳渠將於樸萊茅斯港內之英戰艦列拿威西號艦上，與英王喬治六世會見，文英首相阿特里，外長貝文亦定二日返倫敦。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　據路透社外交訪員基許氏報吿稱，目前倫敦各界以彼次坦會談自上週三因邱吉爾，阿特里二人急於返國而吿中斷，至今仍能圓滿舉行，均感不勝快慰。然據外交界一般觀察，整個波次坦會談已陷　局，蓋目前三國意見有不能融合者，乃　將來德國之行政問題，　在沃得與尼斯河上游波闌邊疆地區之將來行政問題，　戰利品與賠償問題，即目前蘇聯堅持蘇軍在一切解放區內所獲得之戰利品，不能視爲德國之賠償品，亦不能因獲得戰利品而減少應得之賠償數目，　　組尼爾海峽問題，蘇聯建議即刻修正蒙特　條約，　蘇·士問題，蘇聯欲與土耳其重訂雙方友好條約，根據此項條約，土政府應將士國境內之一部份軍略基地供給蘇聯應用，茲美國意爲此一項問題乃蘇，土兩國間之事，毋庸其他國家干涉，刻下在三頭會談中已獲有圓滿之解決者，乃　承認維也納之萊納政府，　蘇台德區德民移至本國。</p>
<h3>渝增派援軍向陝北進攻爺台山共軍後退</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據新華社二十九日息，重慶軍爲進攻陝甘寗各邊區延安電，乃由甘肅省西部之靜審，隆德各方面加調暫編第五十師增援，於二十七日開抵西安北方六十公里地點之前綫，企圖展開全綫攻擊，而賀龍所部之延安軍爲抵禦重慶軍，現正積極增强各項防衛力量。</p>

<h3>老牌林文烟</h3>
<p>— 岑嘉</p>
<p>隆隆，格格格的聲音，已消失了好些時候了，看樣子大約不會再來，於是蹲在樓梯脚下的　計們都鼓足勇氣，爬了出來。那蹲在最喪面的王老　，這時在驚魂甫定之餘，也開始記起了剛纔店堂裏曾有一瓶什麼東西被巨　震得跌碎在地上，想去看看究竟，也跟着爬出來，三脚兩步地往店堂中走去。</p>
<p>射進店堂裏的强烈的陽光頭出了落在每個人臉上衣服上的灰康，石灰：…有的人臉上還有一點　污。</p>
<p>「啊，你看你！」一個夥計一面拍去一副上之塵灰，一面嘲笑着站在對面那個臉上一塊黑一塊白的瘦子。</p>
<p>「你先看看自己，一　一點的，滿頭都是白　！」</p>
<p>「唉，落一點石灰屑還算是運氣的。」那個年齡最大的夥計感歎着說。</p>
<p>「連泥塊石灰都震了下來，剛　一個一定落得很近。」</p>
<p>「等警報解除了，倒要去看看，倒底在那兒？</p>
<p>夥計們正在七嘴八舌一的從這個話題說開去，忽然他們的耳朶裏都聽得「拍」的一聲響，都不由得喫了一驚。但大部份人還能够勉强鎭定着去探究那一聲響的來源；那個瘦子却署也不敢看，就住裏面直跑。</p>
<p>「給你喫七八十萬一担米，等於塞到了狗肚子裏！」</p>
<p>道是老闆的聲音，他一邊說，一邊揮着手朝店裏唯一的學徒走過去，那學徒以爲老　又要給他喫耳光了，便用兩隻手緊緊地護住臉孔，然而老闆却立刻換了花樣——抬起那條瘦而多骨的腿，在學徒的屁股上狠命的踢了一脚，被踢的不曾算到有這麼一着，一時站立不住，便撲倒在地上。</p>
<p>在那學從撲下去的地万，地上全是碎玻璃屑，所以他一着地，兩隻手就立刻冒出血來。至於頭總算因爲抬着，還有碰到玻璃層而弄得流血。</p>
<p>「膿包，通站都站不住！」</p>
<p>那學徒忍着痛搖搖條恍站起來，眼睛裏充滿了淚水，他還用力抑制着，不讓淚水出來。</p>
<p>同時，許多人又發現一他的兩個膝頭正有殷紅的血水從褲子中滲透出來。</p>
<p>「你知道不知道，你這小鬼！——瓶老牌林文烟花露水現在要賣多少錢？」</p>
<p>王老　萬分惋惜地用脚擺弄着斷了的花露水瓶的頸部，流在地上的花　水在陽光中閃閃發光，一陣陣濃郁的香氣從地上直向他的鼻子裏衝去。</p>
<p>「你看香味多少濃，那天有人出二萬塊現鈔，我還不。——現在一跌碎，連一塊錢也不値了</p>
<p>王老　彎下身子去，張着嘴巴恨不得想用舌頭去舐舐。</p>
<p>趁老闆正在一心惋惜花　水的時候，那個年老的夥計悄悄地把那學徒拉進裏面去。學徒所走過的地方，還有血迹流下來。</p>
<p>要是外面沒有拖長的解除警報聲把王老　喚醒過來，他恐怕還要　在跌碎花　水的地方憑　着。</p>
<p>這時他終於站直了身子，他發覺那個學徒已經不在店堂裏，他倒並不查問他躱到那兒去了，却厲地對其餘的夥計說：</p>
<p>「你們呆着幹嗎？還不把玻璃櫃裏的東西收拾收拾，揀値錢的都替我放到裏而去，一瓶老牌花　水已經給你們糟蹋了！－可憐的個人主義者！</p>
<h3>星星</h3>
<p>— 蕭蕭</p>
<p>深宵，還沒有睡意，偶然倚在窗上看星星。這時室內是黑暗的，室外也是一片黑暗，惟有遠天的星星閃着僅有的微弱的光芒，我就愛着它，它能使我流連，忘倦，振奮……黑暗中僅有的一縷光耀，正是啓示着我的前途，雖然它是渺小的，然而是光亮的。</p>
<p>摸摸自己多髮髻的顯顧，覺到我還有自巴眞實的生命，但是我又不敢往下推想……家，生活，妻兒，米，柴……習慣的零星雜憶似霓虹燈的字，一重一重複映在我腦幕裏，盤旋又盤旋，擾亂得我的整個腦子竟是隱隱作痛。</p>
<p>「唉……啊啊……」我甚至要呌起來了，像一頭困獸怒吼着。極目注視着遠天的星星，此外室內和室外是一片黑暗，伴着徹底的寂寞。</p>
<p>然而遠天的星星，明滅不定，於是我重又感到：「多渺小多微弱呀！」它賜予我的又是多麼渺小，微弱。但是，他終久是光亮的！由它一閃一閃地光的微芒，繼續着，繼續着，終於補綴了黑暗的天幕——它是由黑暗到天明的一座橋樑。這很弱是暫時的，這黑暗也是暫時的！</p>
<p>於是我得到一個啓示。我興奮着，遙望着，遠眺警，向着星星。雖是那顆顆微弱又渺小的幽光，然而給我的是無比的親切與智慧的啓發。</p>

<p>感懷</p>
<p>聽一曲——世態炎凉，淚淚叩心扉，聲聲多凄悲！　使跟　過鬧市；買醉街頭，——愁上愁！</p>
<h3>「谷音」評介</h3>
<p>— 施靑</p>
<p>最近新出的綜合雜雜誌「谷音」，夠得上說是大型刋物，夠份量，十五　文章、洋洋洒洒。</p>
<p>「巴爾扎克新論」和「六朝的民歌」，有它們的獨特的見解和精細的考據。翻譯小說三篇：「高級課程」（契詞夫），「一笑之失」（巴爾扎克），一　　的犧牲」（吉辛），都該是力作，尤其是「書蠢的犧牲」作者用寫實的手法，描述出小市民生活的陰瞪面，寫出社會的腐化和不幸者的遭遇。</p>
<p>散文方面，郭朋的」故居」是籃好文章，淡淡的氣氛，讀者都能體　到那股漢然的憂鬱。</p>
<p>在出版荒的今日，在荒蕪的文壇上能有這本東西出現，該市件可喜的事，我們希望它的生命能畏久點，換句話說，第二輯第三輯能繼續地出版，給讀者們帶來一些新東西，一些在需要要的東西。至少，在目前，我們多希望能見到一本好刋物。</p>

        <h1>1945.08.03</h1>
<h3>With the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Integrated and Ready to Unleash Decisive Battle Power, Taiwan Has Also Completed Full Combat Readiness</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 1st that the Imperial Army and Navy are gradually enhancing their decisive battle posture, the significance of which is extremely important. From this, we can see the new determination of the Imperial Army and Navy, which is an unprecedented and significant statement. Former Prime Minister Suzuki, when meeting with reporters, stated that the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff had explained, "The current war situation is what the military is hoping for," which deeply impressed the nation. Both the former Prime Minister's statement and the government's announcement this time show that the Japanese military, under this intense battle, resolutely adheres to this important policy and is gradually strengthening its war preparations. The key to combat is definitely not to simply send troops to the front one after another, but to conduct combat with all decisive battle forces, and if necessary, to mobilize them all at once to determine victory. Japan's fundamental operational policy is based on this principle. Under the continuous enemy air raids, the Japanese army has repeatedly endured, automatically preparing for the decisive battle on the homeland with all its strength, waiting for the opportune moment. Once the military command is issued, it will unleash the Japanese army's prepared decisive battle power. At that time, on land, sea, and air, the enemy will surely suffer unprecedented strategic damage. It is still impossible to predict where the enemy will land. However, the Japanese side will utilize the geographical advantage of the homeland to launch mobile forces anytime, anywhere, and the domestic airports will also serve as forward bases to resist the enemy. Today, the Navy and Air Force are fully integrated, and they will surely annihilate and drive away the enemy in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Southwest Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – If the US military advances towards the mainland in the next operation, Taiwan's strategic position will be extremely important. Therefore, after the Battle of Leyte Gulf unfolded, the entire island of Taiwan completed its preparations for a complete combat posture. Since the enemy troops landed in Lingayen this year, they have been attacking and bombing Taiwan, and it has been more than half a year since they have continued to attack major cities non-stop, and even bombed villages and evacuated areas. However, Taiwan's resilience in terms of manpower and material resources is by no means comparable to Manila and Okinawa. Therefore, the enemy does not directly attack Taiwan, but only carries out daily bombings, attempting to reduce its combat power. However, Taiwan has completed a self-sufficient posture and has not been affected by the end of the Battle of Okinawa. It is not clear whether the enemy's next operation will involve landing in Taiwan. However, no matter what the situation is, Taiwan's army, navy, and air force, together with seven million islanders, have completely prepared all defensive facilities on the island and are now in a state of combat readiness.</p>

They gradually withdrew towards the southern sea around 3:00 AM on the 2nd. The Japanese air force units launched interception warfare at that time and achieved considerable results. Detailed information is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Osaka, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Around noon on the 2nd, approximately 40 P-51 aircraft invaded the Hanshin area from parts of Mie Prefecture and the prefectures of Aichi, Gifu, and Nara. Another 15 P-51 sorties attacked air bases and transportation facilities in the central and southern parts of Shiga Prefecture and the southwestern part of Osaka.</p>
<h3>Interception Warfare Results in the Kyushu Region</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The results of the Japanese air force units' interception warfare against enemy aircraft that attacked the Kyushu region last month on the 30th were one large and one small aircraft shot down, and three large and two small aircraft damaged.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 2nd (Central News Agency) – An enemy bombing and combat formation of approximately 80 small aircraft from the Okinawa base and 60 B-29 aircraft attacked Nagasaki Prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture around 11:00 AM on the 1st, bombarding airfields, ships, and military facilities. The total number of enemy aircraft that attacked Kyushu on the 31st reached approximately 300.</p>
<h3>Hokkaido and Oshima Subjected to Shelling</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Around 2:30 PM on the 1st, three enemy submarines carried out naval bombardment of Yoichi in Hokkaido, with very minor damage on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Aircraft from an American task force attacked Izu Oshima in small formations from morning to around 10:00 AM on the 1st. At the same time, one enemy cruiser and three destroyers approached the island and carried out naval bombardment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Units Attack at Dawn, Fires Erupt at Okinawa Airfield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On the 31st, Japanese air force units attacked enemy-held areas in Okinawa and enemy ships around the island at dawn, setting fire to nine enemy airfields and destroying one enemy vessel of unknown type and one transport ship.</p>
<h3>Intensifying Air Raids Require Extreme Vigilance</h3>
<p>Forward Air Base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Okinawa base has been dispatching 470 to 500 aircraft daily to attack the Kyushu region, gradually expanding its sphere of activity. On the 24th and 25th of last month, in conjunction with the task force, some aircraft operated in the Chugoku region. Furthermore, on the 29th, P-51s and B-25s operated in South Korea. Judging from the operational status of these enemy aircraft, their operational radius is gradually increasing and is bound to expand. It can also be judged that the operational radius of the combined formations of B-24, B-25, P-51, and P-38 fighter-bombers is likely to be around 1,200 kilometers. Therefore, it is possible for them to attack the Chugoku region and the Hanshin area. In the future, there is a need for strict vigilance against the increasingly intensified attacks by the combined fighter-bomber formations departing from that base.</p>

<h3>Five Propaganda Groups Jointly Host Tea Party to Welcome and See Off Secretaries Matudaira and Katsuno</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, the China Broadcasting Association, the China Film Company, the Joint Magazine Association, and the Small Newspaper Association, among other five groups, jointly held a tea party yesterday (2nd) at 5:30 PM to bid farewell to former Information Minister Matudaira and welcome the newly appointed Secretary Katsuno of the Public Relations Department. Information Minister An of the Nanjing Embassy was also invited to attend. Representatives from the five groups and reporters from various newspapers, including Osaka Yoichi, Akahoshi Tamekazu, Moriyama Takashi, Kim Ung-baek, Chen Riben, Xu Liqu, Yuan Shu, Chen Binhe, Dai Linzao, Zhang Shichuan, Lu Feng, and Wang Xuechen, numbering over a hundred people, attended. After formal greetings, Chen Binhe, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, delivered a speech, followed by responses from Mr. Matudaira and Mr. Katsuno. Subsequently, Information Minister An delivered a speech. Finally, movie stars Bai Guang, Li Qingyun, and Wu Jinghong sang, creating a very harmonious atmosphere. The guests and hosts dispersed happily around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chen Binhe, representing the five groups, delivered a welcome and farewell speech: "There are two meanings to holding this tea party today: First, to express our gratitude and bid farewell to Minister Matudaira of the former Embassy for his extensive cooperation over the past year and a half. Second, to welcome Secretary Katsuno, the successor to Secretary Matudaira of the newly organized Public Relations Department. Secretary Katsuno originally served in the Information Department of the Nanjing Embassy and has always had an indirect relationship with us, helping us a lot. Now that he has come to Shanghai, he will surely provide us with more guidance and more cooperation. Recently, the three reporting agencies of the Allied embassies in the area were reorganized into the Public Relations Department, unifying the reporting work. This is something we greatly admire. Information Counselor An of the Nanjing Embassy, who is present today, will assume a major guiding role in the Shanghai Public Relations Department, and we also welcome him. As the situation becomes increasingly tense day by day, our propaganda organizations should also tend towards concentrating their efforts, reducing waste, and seeking to cooperate with the authorities in unifying the war effort."</p>
<h3>Matudaira's Speech</h3>
<p>Secretary Matudaira expressed his gratitude: "I am deeply grateful for the farewell from the five propaganda groups today. I arrived in Shanghai in February of this year and have spent a year and a half here. During this time, I have had a very close relationship with everyone present. However, I have not achieved anything significant during my tenure, and I feel deeply guilty. I sincerely hope to promote friendship and mutual understanding between China and Japan. We must base this on solid diplomatic relations and increase our friendly interactions. At this time of intense conflict, the ties between our two countries should be maintained more closely. I sincerely hope that everyone will continue to provide much guidance in both public and private matters, and at the same time, please also provide the same assistance to Secretary Katsuno."</p>
<h3>Katsuno's Thank You Speech</h3>
<p>Secretary Katsuno thanked everyone: "Minister Matudaira has achieved much during his tenure and has been honorably transferred to serve in Peiping. I have been ordered to succeed him, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to fulfill the task. This time, the three reporting agencies of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force in Shanghai have been merged into one, aiming not for superficial work but for practical development. I will always strive to implement this in order to achieve this goal, and at the same time, I hope that everyone will not hesitate to cooperate and provide guidance. I am deeply grateful for the grand reception today."</p>
<h3>Mr. An's Speech</h3>
<p>Counselor An said: "There is a Japanese saying: 'Silence is better than many words,' but Chairman Chen Binhe mentioned me in his speech about the establishment of the Shanghai Public Relations Department this time, so I have no choice but to make a simple reply. My participation in the work of the Public Relations Department is of little importance. Since taking office in Nanjing two years ago, I have received close cooperation from all relevant parties in Nanjing. Now that I am serving in both Nanjing and Shanghai, I can only take care of both and work together. Please provide guidance and assistance to me from all parties in both Nanjing and Shanghai so that I can complete my task."</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On Air Raid Relief and Rescue Work</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Recently, enemy aircraft have not ravaged our city for several days. Rumor has it that there is a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, which has hindered them. This is by no means the oversensitive speculation of the general public in the city. Enemy aircraft will definitely not relax their grip on the people of Shanghai. We cannot ignore our vigilance because enemy aircraft are temporarily hindered by the weather. Therefore, I would like to offer some opinions on air raid relief and rescue work in our city:</p>
<p>The Civil Defense Headquarters of this city is the implementing agency responsible for air defense, rescue, and relief on the part of the municipal government (of course, this is only part of the work of the Civil Defense Headquarters; other work is not within the scope of this article, so it will not be discussed). The Air Raid Relief Committee of the Civil Welfare Association is the civil society rescue and relief organization. The Civil Defense Headquarters has been established for a long time and has detailed plans and considerable preparations for air defense, rescue, and relief work, but it has not yet reached the most ideal state and needs the assistance of civil society. Recently, after our city has repeatedly encountered air raids, civil society has spontaneously initiated the organization of rescue and relief groups, and all sectors have enthusiastically donated money. This is a very gratifying move.</p>
<p>On Tuesday of this week, following the liaison meeting between the Air Raid Relief Committee of the Civil Welfare Association and the relevant authorities of the municipal government on July 18, I exchanged views with Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the municipal government and Chief of General Affairs Noguchi of the Civil Defense Headquarters on fixed-attack rescue and relief work. The goal of both the government and civil society is to achieve greater efficiency in rescue and relief work during air raids. Our conclusion is that rescue and relief work must be closely linked between the government and civil society in order to achieve effective coordination. First, those who are enthusiastic about promoting rescue and relief work must first recognize that the Civil Defense Headquarters is the implementing agency that issues orders, and the Air Raid Relief Committee of the Civil Welfare Association is the agency that centralizes the rescue and relief efforts of civil society, adjusts the organization of civil society groups, and works under the command of the Civil Defense Headquarters. Because the Civil Defense Headquarters has the fastest information during air raids and has very close ties with the local military and police, it must issue orders. Because the Civil Welfare Association was originally an organization for the welfare of citizens, it must be responsible for centralizing and adjusting the strength and organization of civil society.</p>
<p>Second, we must further recognize that the current period is the most difficult in terms of materials, and no waste is allowed. Even an inch of gauze or a piece of cotton cannot be wasted. After the government and civil society organizations have close ties, we can obey the official command, concentrate the strength of civil society, and achieve no waste, and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Having enthusiasm is not enough. We must obey the command, especially during air raids. The centralization and adjustment work of the Civil Welfare Association is not control or management, but linking the strength of the government and civil society. Recently, in order to promote the liaison work between the government and civil society, Director Wen of the Civil Welfare Association has designated Mr. Gu Nanqun to be responsible for the liaison work with the Civil Defense Headquarters in the medical and pharmaceutical group, and Mr. Chen Riben to be responsible for the liaison work in the relief group. Therefore, other organizations in civil society should establish contact with the medical and pharmaceutical group and the relief group of the Civil Welfare Association, respectively.</p>
<p>We must repeat:</p>
<p>The Civil Defense Headquarters sincerely welcomes the spontaneous relief and rescue work of civil society.</p>
<p>The difficulties of manpower and material resources during wartime do not allow waste, and the work does not allow duplication. It must be promoted in an organized and planned manner, especially air raid relief and rescue work.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the second item, we must first centralize and adjust the strength of civil society, and then be able to cooperate with the Civil Defense Headquarters.</p>
<p>The enemy's attacks and expansion of devastation are very likely. We must never have a moment of relaxation, and we must take strict precautions anytime and anywhere so as to reduce the damage.</p>
<h3>Potsdam Conference Concludes, Three Countries to Issue Statement, Rumors that US President Plans to Meet with the King of England</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Potsdam, the three-party talks concluded on the afternoon of the 1st. The statement of the results of the talks will be issued simultaneously in the three capitals of Washington, London, and Moscow. US President Truman had originally planned to return home by plane after the talks, but there are rumors that he will meet with King George VI of England on the British battleship Renown in Plymouth Harbour. British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Minister Bevin are also scheduled to return to London on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a report by Reuters diplomatic correspondent Kish, at present, all circles in London are extremely gratified that the Potsdam Conference, which was interrupted last Wednesday because Churchill and Attlee were anxious to return home, could still be held successfully. However, according to general observations in diplomatic circles, the entire Potsdam Conference has fallen into a stalemate, because the current differences among the three countries are irreconcilable, namely: 1. The administrative issues of the future Germany. 2. The future administrative issues of the Polish border region upstream of the Oder and Neisse rivers. 3. The issues of war booty and reparations, namely the current Soviet insistence that the war booty obtained by the Soviet army in all liberated areas cannot be regarded as German reparations and cannot reduce the amount of reparations due to the acquisition of war booty. 4. The issue of the Dardanelles Strait. The Soviet Union proposed to immediately revise the Montreux Convention. 5. The issue of the Suez Canal. The Soviet Union wanted to renegotiate a bilateral treaty of friendship with Turkey, according to which the Turkish government should provide the Soviet Union with a portion of the military bases within the territory of Turkey for application. The United States believes that this issue is a matter between the Soviet Union and Turkey and that other countries do not need to interfere. The issues that have been successfully resolved in the three-party talks are: 1. Recognition of the Renner government in Vienna. 2. The transfer of Germans from the Sudetenland to their home country.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch – According to a dispatch from the Yan'an New China News Agency, the Chongqing and Yan'an armies in central Shaanxi Province are still continuing their armed conflicts. As of the 27th, the Yan'an army defending Yetai Mountain, due to the fierce attack by the Chongqing army's Temporarily Organized 59th Division and Reserve 3rd Division, had abandoned the area and retreated to the rear. Since the 24th, the Chongqing army has used field artillery, mortars, and American-made rocket launchers to attack, and the Yan'an army finally could not resist and retreated.</p>
<h3>America's Shipbuilding Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On March 19, 1940, Roosevelt signed the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Five years have passed. Recently, the US Navy and powerful figures boasted of possessing 1,565 ships, sufficient to establish a fleet. The initial decision was to increase the existing strength by 70%, which aroused opposition. Subsequently, the decision was made to increase it by another 70%, known as the Stark Plan. This plan allocated 4 billion US dollars to increase the naval strength from 1.7 million tons to 2.95 million tons within seven years, constructing 280,000 tons of battleships, 120,000 tons of aircraft carriers, 420,000 tons of cruisers, 250,000 tons of destroyers, 70,000 tons of submarines, and 100,000 tons of auxiliary merchant ships. However, according to the Navy Department's recent announcement, the number of warships added to the existing fleet in the past five years totals 1,322, an unprecedented figure in history, with most participating in the Pacific War. Regarding shipbuilding in the past five years, 331 ships were built in naval shipyards, and 991 were built in private shipyards. The former includes 7 battleships, 51 aircraft carriers, 58 destroyers, and 97 submarines. The latter includes 13 aircraft carriers, 105 escort carriers, 44 cruisers, 312 destroyers, and 112 submarines. Furthermore, it is planned to complete 2 battleships, 3 aircraft carriers of 45,000 tons, 9 of 21,700 tons, 2 of 14,500 tons, and 26 escort carriers this year. Generally, the US naval expansion plan began with the Vinson Act in 1934, which authorized the construction of 102 ships, and after overcoming the initial chaos in implementing the Washington and London Treaty shipbuilding limits, the expansion speed has been very significant.</p>

<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Launch Application for Cash Remittances for Evacuees Returning Home; Measures Announced and to Be Implemented Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Central Reserve Bank authorities have noted the increasing number of evacuees returning to their hometowns. Everyone needs cash for travel expenses, transportation, and all expenses upon arrival. However, the practice of discounting currency has not ceased. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to liberally releasing remittance quotas and fully supplying banks and businesses with cash, has decided to launch applications for cash and remittances for evacuees returning home at its South and West District offices starting next week. After the implementation of these measures, they will not only reduce unnecessary losses for returning residents but also eliminate much of the illegal discounting of currency. The application procedures are as follows:</p>
<h3>Application Procedures</h3>
<p>Any Shanghai citizen holding a Shanghai household registration certificate who is genuinely returning to their hometown due to evacuation may apply for cash or remittances in accordance with the provisions of these measures.</p>
<p>The maximum amount of cash that an evacuee returning home may apply for is 1 million yuan per person, and the maximum amount of remittance is 2 million yuan per person. The application is limited to one time only. If the amount applied for is less than the prescribed amount, no additional applications will be allowed in the future.</p>
<p>Evacuees returning home who apply for cash or remittances must provide a guarantor to ensure that they are genuinely returning home due to evacuation and that there is no deception. They must also have one of the following documents: 1. Population movement certificate from the baojia (neighborhood self-governance system). 2. Proof documents from the evacuation agency, certified by the police station's baojia section. 3. A special guarantee from a bank, after verification.</p>
<p>Evacuees returning home who apply for cash must first deposit the instrument with the bank, which will issue a receipt. The applicant's household registration certificate number, name, occupation, address, and other important information must be filled out in detail for investigation. The cash may be collected from the bank three days later upon presentation of the receipt. The application procedure for remittances is the same and should be handled simultaneously.</p>
<p>Evacuees returning home who apply for remittances, in addition to following the procedures in the previous article, may remit to any branch of the bank free of charge. However, remittances must be made by draft and not by telegraphic transfer.</p>
<p>If it is discovered that an evacuee returning home who applies for cash or remittances has falsified evidence, engaged in deception, or used it for arbitrage, the guarantor will be held strictly accountable, and the matter will be handed over to the police for legal action.</p>
<p>These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Chairman Zhou and Director Chen Emphasize Reform of Control Agencies and Request Smooth Exchange of Materials</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Junhui stated that the control of materials for national and civilian needs is an extremely important task.

Last week, he came to Shanghai from Nanjing and frequently contacted Chairman Zhou of the Materials Control Review Committee and relevant parties, and constantly listened to reports from Wen Lanting, Director-General of the Shanghai Business Control Committee, and the chairmen of various control committees, and gave instructions. According to inquiries from relevant parties, Chairman Zhou and Director Chen attach great importance to the preparations for the reform and development of the three control committees for rice, oil, and wheat flour. They are actively seeking to reform the materials control agencies and smooth the exchange of materials in the future.</p>

<h3>Appeal of Police Officer Conviction Case Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Shucheng, the former chief of the Putuo Road Branch Bureau of the Municipal Police Department, and Bao Tianyi, the director of the Administrative Section (currently the chief of the Administrative Section's Zhengsu Section), were sued by Cai Bulou and Cai Buque to the Shanghai District Court for dereliction of duty, fraud, unlawful detention, abuse of prisoners, and assault for being ordered to crack down on illegal ferries during their tenure. After eight months of delay, the final judgment found them not guilty of dereliction of duty, fraud, unlawful detention, and abuse of prisoners, but sentenced Xu and Bao to six months' imprisonment for assault. The countersuit of Xu and Bao against Guo and Cai was also found not guilty. Xu and Bao, dissatisfied with the original judgment, filed an appeal with the Shanghai Higher District Court with the approval of their superiors and opposed the charges of malicious prosecution by Cai and others. The Higher Court accepted the case and opened the trial in the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Appeal at 11 a.m. yesterday, presided over by Director Xuan as the presiding judge. After interrogating the appellants and appellees, Presiding Judge Xuan stated that the court was prepared to determine the scope of the appeal and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<p>In this case, the police authorities maintained police prestige and safeguarded police administration with the court.</p>

<h3>Old Zhabei Branch Bureau Cracks Down on Another Counterfeit Promissory Note Operation; Tens of Millions of Yuan Used in Circulation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Department has repeatedly cracked down on and brought to justice counterfeit promissory note operations. The Old Zhabei Branch Bureau recently cracked down on another counterfeit promissory note operation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A group of ruffians, including Wu Qixin, Yu Shangqing, Yu Runbiao, Sang Xueming, and a woman named Zhang Yuejuan, engaged in illegitimate activities and recently counterfeited "Shanghai Hangzhou Tea Leaf Bank" promissory notes. These notes were widely used in the Old Zhabei, New Cheng, and Taishan districts, especially in the Zhonghua Road area of Nanshi. Several small shops run by small-scale merchants have been defrauded of large sums of money and have gone out of business.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Wu Qixin and Zhang Yuejuan went to the Dahua Women's Shoe Store in the Small Garden on Zhejiang Road and attempted to use the counterfeit promissory notes. The store detected that the notes were fake and refused to accept them, leading to a conflict. Song Bingzheng, chief of the Third Section of the Old Zhabei Branch Bureau, and Police Constable Murai and others happened to be passing by and stepped forward to inquire about the situation. At this time, a clerk from the Xiangcheng Department Store on Guangxi Road recognized Wu and Zhang because they had also used fake promissory notes at the store a few days earlier. The clerk apprehended Wu and Zhang and took them to the bureau for interrogation. Based on the confessions of Wu and the others, the counterfeit promissory note operation was located at No. 2, Lane 113, Changsheng Street, Dajing Road, Nanshi. The other suspects, Yu Shangqing, Yu Runbiao, and Sang Xueming, were also arrested. A stack of counterfeit promissory notes and seals were confiscated. According to their confessions, they had circulated counterfeit promissory notes worth tens of millions of yuan. The bureau hopes that any merchants who have been deceived and have received "Shanghai Hangzhou Tea Leaf Bank" counterfeit promissory notes will report to the Third Section of the bureau so that the case can be closed.</p>

<h3>The Third Hospital of the Red Cross Admits Wounded Civilians</h3>
<p>The Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross at No. 1750 Xinzha Road has admitted many civilian victims injured in air raids.

<h3>Old Brand Lin Wen Perfume</h3>
<p>— Cen Jia</p>
<p>The rumbling, grating sound had disappeared for quite some time. It looked like it probably wouldn’t be back, so the clerks squatting at the bottom of the stairs plucked up their courage and crawled out. Old Wang, who had been squatting in the rearmost place, also began to remember, in the aftermath of his shock, that a bottle of something in the shop had been smashed on the floor by the huge tremor just now. Wanting to see what exactly had happened, he followed the others out, walking quickly towards the shop.</p>
<p>The strong sunlight streaming into the shop illuminated the ash and lime dust on everyone's faces and clothes. Some people even had a bit of grime on their faces.</p>
<p>"Ah, look at you!" one clerk said, patting the dust off his clothes while mocking the skinny man across from him, whose face was covered in patches of black and white.</p>
<p>"You should look at yourself first. You're covered from head to toe in white dust!"</p>
<p>"Sigh, getting hit with a little bit of lime is still lucky," the oldest clerk said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Even mud and lime were shaken down; that means one must have landed very close."</p>
<p>"Once the all-clear is sounded, we should go take a look to see exactly where."</p>
<p>The clerks were chattering away, going off on tangents, when suddenly they all heard a "snap!" sound, and they couldn't help but be startled. However, most of them were able to barely maintain their composure and try to figure out where the sound came from. The skinny man, however, didn't even dare to look and ran straight inside.</p>
<p>"Feeding you seventy or eighty thousand for a *dan* of rice is like throwing it to the dogs!"</p>
<p>It was the boss's voice. As he spoke, he waved his hand and walked towards the only apprentice in the shop. The apprentice thought the boss was going to slap him again, so he tightly protected his face with both hands. However, the boss immediately changed his tactic, raising his thin, bony leg and kicking the apprentice hard in the buttocks. The apprentice, not expecting this, lost his balance and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The ground where the apprentice fell was covered in broken glass shards, so as soon as he landed, blood immediately started flowing from his hands. As for his head, he was at least holding it up, so he didn't hit the glass shards and start bleeding.</p>
<p>"Useless fool, can't even stand up straight!"</p>
<p>The apprentice endured the pain and struggled to his feet, his eyes filled with tears, which he was trying hard not to let out.</p>
<p>At the same time, many people noticed that bright red blood was seeping from the trousers around his knees.</p>
<p>"Do you know, you little devil, how much a bottle of Old Brand Lin Wen Perfume is worth now?"</p>
<p>Old Wang was agonizingly using his foot to play with the neck of the broken perfume bottle. The perfume spilled on the ground sparkled in the sunlight, and a rich fragrance rushed straight into his nose.</p>
<p>"Look how strong the scent is. Someone offered me 20,000 in cash the other day, and I didn't sell it. Now that it's broken, it's not worth a single penny."</p>
<p>Old Wang bent down, wishing he could use his tongue to lick up the spilled perfume.</p>
<p>While the boss was wholly absorbed in lamenting the perfume, the old clerk quietly pulled the apprentice inside. Traces of blood were left where the apprentice had walked.</p>
<p>If the prolonged all-clear siren hadn't awakened Old Wang, he probably would have remained there, reminiscing over the broken perfume.</p>
<p>Finally, he straightened up. He noticed that the apprentice was no longer in the shop. He didn't bother asking where he had hidden himself, but instead sharply said to the remaining clerks:</p>
<p>"What are you standing around doing? Aren't you going to tidy up the things in the glass cabinet? Put all the valuables away for me. You've already ruined a bottle of Old Brand perfume! Miserable individualists!"</p>
<h3>Stars</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xiao</p>
<p>Late at night, still not feeling sleepy, I casually leaned against the window to look at the stars. At this time, the room was dark, and the outside was also shrouded in darkness. Only the stars in the distant sky were twinkling with their faint light. I love them, they make me linger, forget my weariness, and feel uplifted... The only glimmer of light in the darkness is precisely what illuminates my path ahead. Although it is tiny, it is bright.</p>
<p>Touching the thickening hair on my temples, I feel that I still have a real life, but I dare not think further... Family, life, wife and children, rice, firewood... Familiar, sporadic memories, like neon lights, repeatedly appear on the screen of my mind, circling and circling, disturbing my entire brain until it aches faintly.</p>
<p>"Ah... Ah, ah..." I even wanted to cry out, like a trapped beast roaring. I stared intently at the stars in the distant sky. Other than that, the room and the outside were pitch black, accompanied by utter loneliness.</p>
<p>However, the stars in the distant sky flickered uncertainly, and I felt again: "How tiny, how weak!" What it bestows upon me is also so tiny and weak. But, after all, it is bright! From its flashing, twinkling glow, continuing, continuing, it finally fills the dark sky—it is a bridge from darkness to dawn. This weakness is temporary, this darkness is also temporary!</p>
<p>Then I received an inspiration. I was excited, gazing remotely, looking into the distance, towards the stars. Although it was only those faint and tiny lights, what they gave me was incomparable warmth and enlightenment.</p>
<h3>Two Poems</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuanqing</p>
<p>A Lament</p>
<p>To speak of life's bitter wine, the tears of a staggering drunkard!  In vain did I bear the lessons and earnest teachings;  I must linger and lean upon the pavilion, thinking,  Lest the threads of thought be like wandering silk,  While the stars nightly illuminate the prodigal.</p>
<p>Feelings</p>
<p>Listen to a melody -- the world's fickle warmth, tears strike at the heart, voices filled with sorrow! Compel me to pass again by bustling markets; buying wine in the streets -- sorrow upon sorrow!</p>
<h3>Review of "Gu Yin"</h3>
<p>— Shi Qing</p>
<p>The recently published comprehensive magazine "Gu Yin" can be considered a large publication, substantial in content, with fifteen articles, presented in a grand and uninhibited manner.</p>
<p>"A New Theory of Balzac" and "Folk Songs of the Six Dynasties" have their unique insights and meticulous textual research. The three translated novels, "Advanced Course" (Chekhov), "A Moment of Misjudgment" (Balzac), and "The Sacrifice of a Bookworm" (Gissing), should all be considered outstanding works. In particular, "The Sacrifice of a Bookworm," the author uses realistic techniques to depict the darker side of petty bourgeois life, writing about social corruption and the plight of the unfortunate.</p>
<p>In terms of essays, Guo Peng's "Old Residence" is an excellent piece of writing. The reader can feel that faint atmosphere of sorrow and loneliness.</p>
<p>In today's publishing drought, it is a welcome thing to see this magazine appear in the barren literary scene. We hope that its life can be a little longer. In other words, the second and third issues can continue to be published, bringing readers some new things, some necessary things. At least, for the moment, we hope to see a good publication.</p>
