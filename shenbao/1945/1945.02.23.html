<p>南京二十二日中央社電　際茲大東亞戰爭決戰階段，前線戰事之轉移，固足以影響戰局之歸趨；後方泱戰體制之增强及兵站基地之健全與否，亦足以左右全面戰局。滿洲素有大東亞後方兵站基地之稱，記者爲明暸滿國最近之決戰體制現狀曁滿蘇邊境之最近情形，特於日昨在訪滿洲國新任駐華大使李紹庚氏，當蒙接見，幷就所關各點回答如下：</p>
<p>決戰體制</p>
<p>溯自大東亞戰爭發生以來，我滿洲國即發表聲明，舉全國之總力，協助盟邦，基於共同防衛之大義，充分準備決戰下之種種施策，以期發揮國力，完成後方兵站基地之任務。然在遂行此任務上所必要的一種條件，是即所謂決戰體制，我國的決戰體制，即爲遵奉皇帝陛下時局詔書所昭示「官民一心，萬方一志，舉國人而盡奉公之誠，舉國力而援盟邦之戰」之聖訓。我滿洲四千三百萬人民咸能仰體聖詔意旨，澈底實踐，即是動員全國人的力量與物的力量，協助盟邦，貢獻聖戰，務使人盡其能，地盡其力，物盡其用，即所謂全國人力物力動員是也。</p>
<p>因有以上關係，所有一切戰時體制，易推進施行，而且分政事務，敏捷簡易，實行雙腿率，日益增進，凡戰時施策，中央命令一下，即時普遍渗透於民間，最顯著者，如國兵之編練，國民之練成，國民勤勞奉公制度之確立，糧穀出貨之踴躍完成，交通通信之迅速便利，無不收到圓滿順利之成効。且因戰時體制之實施，從前個人的自由經濟一變而爲全體的統制經濟，而置重點於戰力之增强，資材之增產，物資消費之限制，低物價政策之實施，務使戰時經濟財政益加强化，更對於鑛工農畜資材勞力各部門積極考慮，努力增產，以謀戰時緊要物資之對日供給。同時，幷獲得日本資金權術上之援助，所謂有無相通，長短相補，務期達到增產之目的，供應戰時下一切之需要。至其進行之目標，則根據康德九年所樹立之第二次經濟建設五年計劃，及滿洲國基本國策大綱，分別緩急，次第推行，以求貫澈。</p>
<p>軍需生產</p>
<p>滿洲國本屬農本國家以言軍需生產，當然難免落後，但是軍需生產所需之原料如鍘鐵銅鋁煤材電力及化學工業等資源，在第一次產業開產計劃完成時，已有相當的生產數量，因而軍需工廠之新設，亦同時並進，且以戰時下之需要，自當積極整備，以資供應，近來滿洲之飛機與汽車製造頗爲發達，產量日增。此外，如兵器製造工廠亦特加擴充，其他輕金屬工廠亦有設立，成績甚佳，一切設施較之滿洲建國當年誠不可同日而語。</p>
<p>國軍情形</p>
<p>滿洲國軍，自建國以來業已經過數期之整頓，，制定頒布國兵法，由於已往之準備工作，而施行義務兵役制度，於是面目一新，而開始近代國家新軍隊化。當時世界情勢嚴重，東亞共榮圈正在邁進確立之際，歐洲戰事方興，英美並將伸其麽手於東亞，在就時期，施行國兵法，謀國軍之素質向上，。此外，更設軍人後援會，對於軍人家族生活之救護，與以充分之保證。滿洲國軍及直隸於皇帝陛下之國家軍隊，平時擔富維持國內治安邊境及江海之警備，一朝有事，擔任國防第一線或確保後方兵站之重責，國軍之編成，乃以現在中央直隸軍及十一</p>

<p>迄於今日，堪稱爲最優秀之國家精銳，其所負之使命，不僅捍衛北邊，實可分擔保衛東亞之責任，非過言也。溯自滿洲建國當時，兵匪充斥，剿撫兼施，國軍內容極爲複雜，雖曾迭加整理，設立軍管區司令官，分別統轄，然仍暫取募兵制度，易滋流弊，迨至康德七年四月一日昻揚，國民對國家之義務心理，實爲當前急務，茲將國兵法之概要述之如下</p>
<p>國兵法施行之初，參酌國民程度，兵役年限爲三年，一部特定者爲一年以內（國兵法第五條），徵兵年齡爲滿十九歲，並爲安定民心起見，制定軍事援護法，軍事優遇要網個軍管區並江上軍組織之，俱負有所定區域治安防衛之任務。</p>
<p>國軍之特殊部隊，現有飛行隊，高射砲隊，機械化部隊，江上軍自動車隊，工兵隊，憲兵團等，敎育機關有陸軍訓練學校，陸軍軍官學校，陸軍興安學校，陸軍自動車學校，憲兵訓練處，陸軍軍需學校，陸軍軍醫學校，陸軍獸醫學校等，此外培義中堅人才之高等軍事敎育機關，亦已成立矣。</p>
<p>鋼鐵增產</p>
<p>滿洲鑛產埋藏甚富，尤其鐵的生產，實佔重要地位，如建國產無人過問之東邊道區，一躍而被認所注目。自康德七年九月圈內鋼鐵自給自足之計劃，遂即急速確立，所以在同年十二日本政府發表，日滿華鐵的生產力擴充要綱，就中滿洲國鋼鐵之增產，必須急謀施策以應急需。惟在第一次產業開發五年計劃中，對于鑛工部門曾經一度修正，擴大其鋼鐵一項，特別考慮其增產目標，即是除國內自給自足外，同時使之確保對日供給，藉以貢獻戰時下之需要。現在第二次五年計劃，芷在逐步進行，對于鋼鐵之生產，已大有可觀，再我滿洲製造鋼鐵最可珍貴之天然條件，即是產鐵區域，同時亦產煤利用其他域之煤，作爲練鋼之用，不須長途運輸之勞，實慶事半功倍，運力，又省時間。有此天然之良好條件，再加以科學方法，周密計劃，鋼鐵業之飛躍發展，自可期待也</p>
<p>邊境關係</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭發生以來，我滿洲國之立塲，除遂聖戰外，同時幷担保北邊鎭護之責任，現在國境方面，鎭靜如常，安如磐石，其與蘇聯始終維持道義和平之態度，以期漸進於好，相信今後必無邊事可慮也。</p>
<p>農業開發</p>
<p>滿洲向有東亞穀倉之稱，故屬於農本國家，全國農民佔十之八九，土地爲乾燥性，南滿是黃土，中滿北滿是黑土，尙有一部份可作水田，水稻生產頗爲良好實爲亞食糧基地，對於世界特殊農產物之供給，已有多年之歷史，尤其在此大東亞聖戰下滿洲國農業地位，愈增加其重要性。蓋自滿洲建國以來，政府對於農業深加注意，近至康德四年，樹立產業開發五年計劃，尤傾注莫大之努力，如改良品種，騙除害虫，增設農事試騐塲等，莫不積極實施。同時設立農業專門學校農科大學，對於農業技稱人才，亦努力養成訓練，並因開拓政策之進行，極力開墾荒地，較之建國當時農墾地地已增加三分之一。近數年來雨陽適宜，又得天惠，所以俱是豐年，收獲量頗爲可觀。去歲更超超過預定數量以上，隊自給自足外，並能對日及對華北輸出。現在第二次五年計劃正在實施，基於過去十餘年之經騐，對於確保增產，及農產物之流通，蒐貨配給等制度，亦已整備完善，其平時運營指導機關，即爲興農合作社，於康德七年三月公布興農合作社法，同時統合以前之農事合作社及金融合作社，而在中央及省設立中央曾及聯合會，在市縣鎮分別設立合作社，均經受主管部大臣之指導監督，從事於農村之建設，農事之改良發達，及農民福利之增進，以貢獻國家經濟之發展，並與行政機關緊密聯絡，次第推行一切計劃，使之直接滲透於民間。同時設立興農倉庫，對於貧困農民，隨時貸金救濟，務使增產前途毫無遺憾。總之，現在滿洲國之農業已邁進於大量增產之階段，從此廣大肥沃之地面，再加以科學的開發改良，必可發揮無限之物力，充分貢獻於戰時下內外之需要，以增强其戰鬥力量。滿洲國以其天賦資源，對於東亞全體之食糧問題，實盡莫大之實獻也。建國十餘年來諸般施政均極飛躍發展，以上所談以時間關係，僅數點而已。</p>
<p>完遂戰爭</p>
<p>現在大東亞戰爭已進入泱勝階段，前方戰事日趨苛烈，東亞民族之興亡均繫於此，深望東亞各國家，亦各以共全國總力，盡其應負之責任，尤其中華民國，佔東亞軸心之重要地位，相信必能與日滿相呼應，致力於決戰體制，動員全國之人力物力，協助盟邦完遂戰，以達成吾人之共同目的也。</p>

<h3 id="c12">渝共關係的新發展 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>渝共的關係，是大東亞戰爭中的軍要政治問題之一，它的好轉和惡化，與大東亞戰爭的進行，不無關係，我們自有注意的必要。</p>
<p>渝共關係，建立在「抗日」一點上。雖然在「抗日」二字上下加着「民族」和「統一戰錢」等字樣，以示限制與遵守，但是，雙方都沒有受限制和能遵守。而彼此是利用「抗日」來發展各同的企圖，就是重慶想以「抗日」來消滅異己的力量，一貫獨栽政治；而中共呢？則以「抗日」來發展自己的實力，同時建立所謂民主的政治基礎，標榜真正實行三民主義，以之爲挾制重慶的手段。這種同床異夢的企圖，在抗戰一年餘後，武漢失陷時起，就顯露出來了，因之渝共關係，從此逆轉了。</p>
<p>從民國二十八年到三十三年九月渝共正式談判止，六年中，事資上渝共已處於敵對狀態中，所以沒有走上全面破裂者，還是繫於拖戰一點上。這點關係，不絕如縷，我們未能及時打開中日間的似局，卒被美國所利用，非常可惜的。美國需要渝共爲他所驅策，必須先使渝共和平相處，然後才能遂其目的，對抗日本，所以對蔣要求用政治途徑解決渝共問題，因此，才有去年九月間的渝共談判的一幕，經過四個月，談判結果，雙方意見相距仍遠，卒吿破裂。蔣爲答復參政員的質問，並表示民主起見，允許中共代表林祖涵在參政會上報告談判經過，林的報告內容，是非難渝方缺乏誠意，說明共方已實行四項諾言，指摘渝方歪曲事實，最後攻擊渝方政治不良，要求組織聯合政府。（全文見一月十八二十日本報）這種要求當非重慶所能接受，渝共的關係，勢必陷於停頓中</p>
<p>延安方面如此大胆的提出要求，直向重慶示威，他所依恃的什麼？明白了這一點，對於觀察渝共關係的發展，才有了中心的根據。</p>
<p>自然國際上的民主的壓力，提高了延安方面的勇氣，再加以美國方面的支持，大刀闊斧的向蔣砍去，是不會遭受反擊的。其决由於渝蔣的獨裁，已招致了各黨各派及中間人的離心，可是敢怒而不敢言，延安方面，審時察勢，以自已的軍事政治力量，向蔣衝鋒，放大砲，決不會招受各黨派各階層的反對，而負破壞團結的罪名，相反的會受到他們的響應，作爲自巳的後盾。如此，則爭取了渝國民黨以外的政治勢力，亦即是削弱了渝國民黨的威信。其三，攻擊重慶的政治不良，作爲要求改組聯合政府的理由，如此進一步的提高了在抗戰中求發展的策略，同時亦能適合美国要中國共同抗日的要求，而又提高了延安的國際地位。</p>
<p>根據上述三點，延安方面泱不肯錯過这样絕好的機會，假使渝蔣不辭決裂，那末，延安如何來收拾破裂局面呢？它似乎並不十分顧到破壞團結了，大有「你不幹，我來幹給你看」的神氣。試觀紐的泰晤士報特派員的報告：「延安政權現巳考慮，組織中國民主聯合委員會，或與此類似之獨立機關。此項計劃，若行實現，則中國將分裂爲三，其國內對立之紛爭，殊難以和平之手段解決。一（見十一日本報）可見端倪了。</p>
<p>以最近的消息来看，重慶已作多方讓步，第一，承認延安之合法地位；第二，允許延安代表參加軍事委員會；第三，爲組織戰時內閣，承認延安及其他各黨代表參加行政；第四，爲檢討共產軍之補給及改編問題，由延安重慶及美國各代表組織委員會。（見十八日本報）但是，延安方面仍是拒絕。渝共談判開始以來，渝方所作的讓步，終不能使延安滿意。因爲延安要求，實行各黨各派參加的聯合政府及聯合統帥部，而渝蔣終不肯答允，這是談判不成的焦點。</p>
<p>爲中國前途打算，我們對於渝共之爭及其發展，決不能忽視，爲東亞前途打算，更不能忽視。敵美可以利用渝共關係延續其侵略東亞的野心。而中日政治指導者，在此大束亞戰爭的決戰階段，實不能不加以密切注視。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the American enemy began landing on Iwo Jima on the 19th, they have repeatedly launched wave attacks with multiple tanks. Japanese hero Lieutenant Nakamura (previously mistaken as Captain), single-handedly used a rapid-firing gun to destroy over twenty enemy tanks before valiantly dying in battle. On the 21st, the unit commander specially awarded him a commendation and announced it to the entire army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the morning of the 21st, enemy forces around Iwo Jima have used their main fleet to bombard the northern sea area of the island, and a portion of their ships bombarded the main Japanese positions and the northern part of the island from the southern sea area. At noon on the 21st, more than ten large transport ships began landing on the southern coast, and further landings were attempted at the southeast rocky coast of Mount Suribachi and at the southwest Cape Nishi. At noon on the 21st, the enemy ships around the island included one battleship, sixteen cruisers and destroyers, more than eighty large transport ships, and over three hundred and fifty landing craft of various sizes, totaling four hundred and ninety ships.</p>

<p>Luzon Base, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The battle on Luzon Island has become an inch-by-inch struggle. Japanese troops are still holding positions in the old city of Manila, from Rizal Park to the Magallanes Barracks area. Enemy aircraft frequently bombard Baguio.

<p>Commander Otsuto Discusses Weaknesses of U.S. Troops - Front Line Near Lingayen, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – It has been one and a half months since the American enemy invaded Luzon. Japanese troops in the Philippines, relying on the "Yamashita tactics" and "charge tactics," have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Commander Otsuto, a famous charge team leader, discussed the weaknesses of U.S. troops and the firm belief in victory of the Japanese army: U.S. soldiers are truly a disorganized mob with low skill levels. They have received little military training, are ignorant of tactics, and are no match for the Japanese army. Japanese charge tactics often involve, after identifying a target, carrying hand grenades or explosives, infiltrating enemy positions, throwing them, and immediately concealing themselves. Daring Japanese soldiers sometimes sneak into the bedrooms of enemy officers to seize secret documents and assassinate them. In the past month, the number of enemy soldiers suffering from nervous breakdowns due to lack of sleep or fear of sleeping soundly has been increasing daily. Moreover, any place that is attacked is immediately abandoned and its defenses strengthened. As a result, the hills near these places see a growing number of enemy graves. Once the reality of these charge tactics is known in America, the families of the dead will undoubtedly weep bitterly.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the shifting front lines can influence the outcome of the war. The strengthening of the home front war effort and the soundness of the logistical base also affect the overall war situation. Manchuria has long been called the logistical base of the Greater East Asia War. To understand Manchuria's current decisive war effort and the latest situation on the Manchurian-Soviet border, the reporter recently interviewed Li Shao-geng, the new Manchurian Ambassador to China, who kindly granted an audience and answered the following questions:</p>
<p>Decisive War Effort</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria has issued a statement declaring that it will mobilize all of its national strength to assist its allies. Based on the principle of common defense, it is fully preparing for various measures under the decisive war effort to bring its national power into play and complete the mission of a logistical base. However, one condition necessary for carrying out this mission is the so-called decisive war effort. Manchuria's decisive war effort is to follow the Emperor's edict, which states, "Government and people as one, united in purpose, the entire nation devoting itself to public service, the entire national power supporting the allies' war." The forty-three million people of Manchuria can understand and thoroughly implement the spirit of the Imperial Edict, which means mobilizing the power of all people and things to assist the allies, contribute to the holy war, and ensure that each person uses their ability, each land uses its strength, and each thing uses its utility. This is the so-called mobilization of all national human and material resources.</p>
<p>Because of the above, all wartime systems are easily promoted and implemented, and administrative affairs are handled quickly and simply. Efficiency is increasing daily. Once a central order on wartime measures is issued, it immediately permeates the people. The most prominent examples are the training of national soldiers, the cultivation of national strength, the establishment of a national labor service system, the enthusiastic completion of grain shipments, and the rapid and convenient transportation and communication. All of these have achieved satisfactory and smooth results. Moreover, due to the implementation of the wartime system, the previous individual free economy has transformed into a comprehensive controlled economy, with emphasis placed on strengthening combat power, increasing production of materials, restricting consumption of goods, and implementing low-price policies to further strengthen the wartime economy and finances. Furthermore, we are actively considering and striving to increase production in the mining, industrial, agricultural, livestock, resource, and labor sectors to secure the supply of essential wartime materials to Japan. At the same time, we are obtaining assistance from Japan in terms of capital and technology. We are complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses to achieve the goal of increasing production and meeting all wartime needs. The goals of this effort are based on the Second Five-Year Economic Construction Plan established in the ninth year of Kangde and the outline of Manchuria's basic national policy, which are being implemented in order of priority to ensure their thorough completion.</p>
<p>Military Production</p>
<p>Manchuria is primarily an agricultural country, so military production is inevitably lagging behind. However, the raw materials required for military production, such as iron, copper, aluminum, coal, timber, electricity, and chemical industrial resources, already had significant production quantities at the completion of the First Industrial Development Plan. As a result, the establishment of new military factories has also progressed simultaneously, and they are being actively prepared to meet the needs of the wartime. In recent years, Manchuria's aircraft and automobile manufacturing have become quite developed, and production is increasing daily. In addition, weapons manufacturing plants have also been expanded, and other light metal factories have been established, achieving excellent results. All these facilities are incomparable to those in Manchuria when the country was founded.</p>
<p>National Army Situation</p>
<p>The Manchurian National Army has undergone several reorganizations since its founding, and the National Conscription Law has been enacted and promulgated. Thanks to past preparations, the conscription system has been implemented, giving the army a new look and transforming it into a modern national army. At the time, the world situation was serious, and the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was advancing toward establishment. The European war was raging, and Britain and the United States were extending their reach to East Asia. During that period, the National Conscription Law was implemented to improve the quality of the National Army. In addition, a military support association was established to provide full guarantees for the welfare of military families. The Manchurian National Army and the national army directly under the Emperor are usually responsible for maintaining domestic security, border patrol, and coastal defense. In times of emergency, they are responsible for the front line of national defense or ensuring the logistical base. The National Army is composed of the current central direct army and eleven</p>

<p>To this day, they can be considered the most excellent elite of the nation. Their mission is not only to defend the northern border but also to share the responsibility of protecting East Asia. This is no exaggeration. Since the founding of Manchuria, bandits have been rampant, and suppression and appeasement have been carried out simultaneously. The composition of the National Army was extremely complex. Although it has been reorganized several times and military district commanders have been established to govern separately, the conscription system was still temporarily used, which easily led to abuses. However, since the 1st of April in the seventh year of Kangde, the national obligation mentality has been a pressing issue. The outline of the National Conscription Law is described below.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the implementation of the National Conscription Law, considering the level of the people, the term of service was three years, and for a specific group, it was within one year (Article 5 of the National Conscription Law). The conscription age was 19 years old. To stabilize public sentiment, a military support law and a military preferential treatment outline were established. Military districts and river army organizations were established, all of which are responsible for the security and defense of designated areas.</p>
<p>The special units of the National Army currently include air squadrons, anti-aircraft artillery units, mechanized units, river army automobile units, engineer units, and gendarmerie regiments. Educational institutions include the Army Training School, the Army Military Academy, the Army Xing'an School, the Army Automobile School, the Gendarmerie Training Center, the Army Quartermaster School, the Army Medical School, and the Army Veterinary School. In addition, a higher military education institution for cultivating key talents has also been established.</p>
<p>Increased Steel Production</p>
<p>Manchuria is rich in mineral resources, especially iron production, which occupies an important position. For example, the eastern border area, which no one cared about before the founding of the country, has suddenly attracted attention. Since the establishment of the plan for self-sufficiency in steel within the territory in September of the seventh year of Kangde, it has been rapidly established. Therefore, in December of the same year, the Japanese government announced the outline for expanding iron production capacity in Japan, Manchuria, and China, in which Manchuria's steel production must be urgently increased to meet immediate needs. However, in the First Industrial Development Five-Year Plan, the mining sector was once revised, expanding the steel component and specially considering its production target, which is to ensure domestic self-sufficiency and secure supply to Japan, thereby contributing to wartime needs. Now the Second Five-Year Plan is being implemented step by step, and steel production has made great progress. The most valuable natural condition for steel manufacturing in Manchuria is that the iron-producing area also produces coal. Using coal from other areas for steelmaking eliminates the need for long-distance transportation, saving effort and time. With these good natural conditions, coupled with scientific methods and meticulous planning, the rapid development of the steel industry can be expected.</p>
<p>Border Relations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria's position has been to pursue the holy war and ensure the protection of the northern border. The national border is calm and as solid as a rock. It has always maintained a moral and peaceful attitude toward the Soviet Union, hoping to gradually improve relations. It is believed that there will be no border troubles in the future.</p>
<p>Agricultural Development</p>
<p>Manchuria has long been called the granary of East Asia, so it is an agricultural country. Farmers account for 80-90% of the population. The soil is arid. Southern Manchuria is loess, while central and northern Manchuria are black soil. Some areas can be used for paddy fields. Rice production is quite good and is a food base. It has a long history of supplying special agricultural products to the world. Especially under this Greater East Asia Holy War, Manchuria's agricultural position is becoming increasingly important. Since the founding of Manchuria, the government has paid close attention to agriculture. Up to the fourth year of Kangde, it established a five-year industrial development plan and devoted great efforts to improving varieties, eliminating pests, and establishing agricultural experiment stations, all of which were actively implemented. At the same time, agricultural vocational schools and agricultural universities were established to train agricultural technical talents. Due to the implementation of the development policy, wasteland was vigorously reclaimed, increasing arable land by one-third compared to the founding of the country. In recent years, rainfall and sunshine have been moderate, and the harvest has been abundant. Last year, the amount exceeded the predetermined amount, which can be used for export to Japan and North China in addition to self-sufficiency. The Second Five-Year Plan is now being implemented, based on the experience of the past ten years, to ensure increased production, and the distribution and allocation systems for agricultural products have also been improved. The usual operational guidance agency is the Xingnong Cooperative. The Xingnong Cooperative Law was promulgated in March of the seventh year of Kangde. At the same time, the former agricultural cooperatives and financial cooperatives were integrated, and central and provincial central and federations were established. Cooperatives were established in cities, counties, and towns, all under the guidance and supervision of the Minister of the competent department, engaged in rural construction, agricultural improvement and development, and the promotion of farmers' welfare, contributing to the country's economic development. It closely cooperates with administrative agencies to gradually implement all plans, so that they directly penetrate the people. At the same time, Xingnong warehouses were established to provide loans and relief to poor farmers at any time, so that there is no regret in the future of increased production. In short, Manchuria's agriculture has now entered a stage of massive increase in production. From this vast and fertile land, combined with scientific development and improvement, the unlimited material power can be brought into full play, fully contributing to the domestic and foreign needs under wartime conditions, so as to enhance its combat strength. Manchuria, with its natural resources, has made great contributions to the food problem of the entire East Asia. In the past ten years since the founding of the country, various policies have developed very rapidly. The above is just a few points due to time constraints.</p>
<p>Complete the War</p>
<p>Now the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, and the war on the front lines is becoming increasingly fierce. The rise and fall of the East Asian nations are tied to this. It is hoped that the East Asian nations will do their best and fulfill their responsibilities. In particular, the Republic of China occupies an important position in the axis of East Asia. It is believed that it will cooperate with Japan and Manchuria, devote itself to the decisive war effort, mobilize the national human and material resources, assist the allies to complete the war, and achieve our common goals.</p>

He said that the city of Berlin has been divided into combat zones, and each zone has been assigned a capable officer to command. The Berlin Defense Forces are deployed to thoroughly utilize natural fortresses such as bridges, rivers, and canals, as well as buildings and roads, to form fortresses. Even insects have no gaps to enter. The streets are full of countless detours. The newspapers predicted that the war was about to break out. Also, military newspapers wrote articles on the future street battles, saying that the news agency may stop functioning. At that time, it will be replaced by small newspapers, leaflets, or wall newspapers. The food for the citizens is also changed to field food like the army so that they can maintain after the electricity and gas are cut off. A large number of women and children avoid difficulty in accommodation and shipping. It is said that in the battle, the workers should stick to their duties and stick to the end. In addition, the notices on the precautions and suggestions in future street battles said that the citizens' emergency court in the combat area announced on the 16th will perform its duties immediately, and those who are enough to depress the fighting will be severely punished. Therefore, the current citizen actions are only toward the final battle, and they are becoming more and more serious and tense.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e12">New Developments in the Chongqing-Communist Relationship <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The relationship between Chongqing and the Communists is one of the crucial military and political issues in the Greater East Asia War. Its improvement or deterioration is related to the progress of the Greater East Asia War, and we have a necessary reason to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Chongqing-Communist relationship is based on the point of "resistance against Japan." Although the words "national" and "united front" are added before and after the words "resistance against Japan" to indicate restrictions and compliance, neither side has been restricted nor able to comply. Both sides are using "resistance against Japan" to develop their own intentions, that is, Chongqing wants to use "resistance against Japan" to eliminate dissenting forces and implement consistent dictatorial politics. As for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), it uses "resistance against Japan" to develop its own strength, while establishing a so-called democratic political foundation, advocating the genuine implementation of the Three Principles of the People, as a means to restrain Chongqing. This kind of attempt, with different dreams in the same bed, became apparent after more than a year of resistance against Japan, when Wuhan fell. As a result, the Chongqing-Communist relationship has reversed since then.</p>
<p>From 1939 to September 1944, when Chongqing and the Communists officially negotiated, the two parties were in a state of hostility in reality. The reason why they did not move towards a complete split was still tied to the point of protracted war. This relationship was tenuous, and we failed to open up the situation between China and Japan in time, which was ultimately exploited by the United States, which is very regrettable. The United States needs the Chongqing-Communist relationship to be at its disposal and must first allow Chongqing and the Communists to coexist peacefully before it can achieve its goal of resisting Japan. Therefore, it demanded that Chiang Kai-shek resolve the Chongqing-Communist problem through political means. As a result, there was the scene of the Chongqing-Communist negotiations in September last year. After four months, the negotiations broke down because the two sides' opinions were still far apart. In order to answer the questions of the senators and to express democracy, Chiang Kai-shek allowed Lin Zuhan, the representative of the CCP, to report on the negotiations at the Senate. The content of Lin's report was to criticize Chongqing for lacking sincerity, explaining that the Communist Party had implemented four promises, accusing Chongqing of distorting the facts, and finally attacking Chongqing's poor politics, demanding the organization of a coalition government. (See the full text in this newspaper on January 18th and 20th) This kind of request is certainly not acceptable to Chongqing, and the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists will inevitably fall into a standstill.</p>
<p>What does Yan'an rely on to make such bold demands and directly demonstrate to Chongqing? Understanding this point is the central basis for observing the development of the Chongqing-Communist relationship.</p>
<p>Naturally, international democratic pressure has increased the courage of Yan'an. Coupled with the support of the United States, it will not suffer a counterattack to boldly slash at Chiang Kai-shek. This is because Chongqing's dictatorship has led to the alienation of various parties and factions and middlemen, but they dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Yan'an, judging the situation, uses its own military and political power to attack Chiang Kai-shek, and will not be opposed by various parties and factions and strata, and bear the crime of destroying unity. On the contrary, it will be echoed by them as its backing. In this way, it has won the political forces outside the Chongqing Kuomintang, that is, it has weakened the prestige of the Chongqing Kuomintang. Thirdly, attacking Chongqing's poor politics is the reason for demanding the reorganization of a coalition government. In this way, it further enhances the strategy of seeking development in the War of Resistance, and at the same time, it can meet the requirements of the United States for China to jointly resist Japan, and also improve the international status of Yan'an.</p>
<p>Based on the above three points, Yan'an will never miss such an excellent opportunity. If Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing does not hesitate to break with it, then how will Yan'an clean up the broken situation? It does not seem to care very much about destroying unity, and has the spirit of "If you don't do it, I'll do it for you." Looking at the report of the special correspondent of the New York Times: "The Yan'an regime is now considering organizing a China Democratic Joint Committee, or a similar independent agency. If this plan is realized, China will be divided into three, and the internal disputes will be difficult to resolve by peaceful means." (See this newspaper on the 11th) The clue can be seen.</p>
<p>According to recent news, Chongqing has made many concessions. First, it recognizes the legal status of Yan'an; second, it allows Yan'an representatives to participate in the Military Commission; third, in order to organize a wartime cabinet, it recognizes Yan'an and representatives of other parties to participate in administration; fourth, in order to review the supply and reorganization of the Communist army, a committee is organized by representatives from Yan'an, Chongqing, and the United States. (See this newspaper on the 18th) However, Yan'an still refuses. Since the beginning of the Chongqing-Communist negotiations, the concessions made by Chongqing have not been able to satisfy Yan'an. Because Yan'an demands the implementation of a coalition government and a joint command participated by all parties and factions, but Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing is unwilling to agree, which is the focus of the failed negotiations.</p>
<p>For the sake of China's future, we must not ignore the Chongqing-Communist dispute and its development. For the sake of East Asia's future, we must not ignore it even more. The enemy United States can use the Chongqing-Communist relationship to continue its ambition to invade East Asia. The political leaders of China and Japan must pay close attention to this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram): The new Japanese Finance Minister Tsushima met with a group of reporters at the official residence of the Minister of Finance on the night of the 21st to talk about his policy aspirations, briefly stating that in order to adapt to the financial policies under the current tense war situation, he had to resolve to thoroughly promote increased production and transportation, integrate it with industrial policies, and strongly promote established policies. At this time of transition, it is especially appropriate to concentrate the total strength of China, Japan, and Manchuria to focus on the war effort.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency telegram): Japanese government secretary-general Hirose resigned after taking office on the 10th to fill the vacancy left by secretary-general Tanaka, because his operating policy toward the local administration council had some relation to the Koiso cabinet's opinion. Prime Minister Koiso decided to resolutely carry out the third partial cabinet reshuffle, appointing Ishiwatari as secretary-general. Ishiwatari previously served as finance minister in the Hiranuma cabinet and secretary-general in the Yonai cabinet, enjoying considerable popularity. His appointment as secretary-general in the joint cabinet of Koiso and Yonai is most appropriate. Tsushima previously served as deputy governor of the Bank of Japan. This time, recommended by Finance Minister Ishiwatari, he took on the important task of wartime finance. He also served as president of the North China Development Company for four years. With his skills and experience, he will surely make a great contribution to wartime finance and the problem of currency inflation in the mainland.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Candle Merchants Who Fail to Report Taxes Will Be Punished According to Law <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality Candle Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, candle merchants have been actively collecting and paying taxes in accordance with the collection regulations. Previously, the Candle Industry Association once misunderstood and resisted paying taxes. Now, after the office explained and urged them to pay taxes, this tax resistance dispute has been resolved. However, there are still many candle merchants who disobey orders and conceal their income, which has greatly affected tax revenue. It is learned that this candle tax is one of the national tax revenues, and the people have an obligation to pay taxes and must not violate the law. The Changju of the Ministry of Finance should investigate and punish such illegal candle merchants, and the contracting office should be responsible for urging collection and must not condone their evasion.</p>

<p>The rickshaw guild, Wu, requested to increase rental prices due to the high cost of living, which was approved by the Changju, who also instructed the guild to ensure that rickshaw pullers who wait for fares must operate in accordance with the regulations. However, the bureau has discovered that rickshaw pullers waiting for fares are still arbitrarily demanding extra fares, which has seriously affected traffic. Therefore, the bureau has ordered the guild to strictly prohibit rickshaw pullers from demanding extra fares. If they do not operate in accordance with the regulations, they will be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Tonight's Basketball League: Zhongbei vs. Donghua to Decide Champions of Divisions A and B; Zhongbei vs. Hualian League Presale Tickets <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The public basketball league has concluded for all divisions except Division B. Only the Zhongbei and Hualian teams of Division A have not officially competed. According to the original schedule, the first round of competition between the two teams was on February 4, and the second round was on February 21. However, during the first round of competition, the audience was too crowded, and they stood on the court line, which did not comply with the official competition rules. At that time, the league authorities announced that the game was a friendly match and scheduled a makeup game on February 24. Also, before the second round of February 21, the league authorities had repeatedly planned and, in order to maintain order and improve management, specially raised the ticket prices, reduced the number of tickets, and implemented presale tickets. Unexpectedly, problems arose with the tickets again, and they could not be sold in advance on the original date (February 20), so the game had to be rescheduled, causing the audience to go back and forth in vain to buy tickets. The makeup game for the first round between Zhongbei and Hualian on February 24 will still have presale tickets. The time is from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 23rd. The ticket prices are 500 yuan for the upper floor and 2,000 yuan for the lower floor. Tickets will not be sold at the door.</p>
<p>Also, there are three league games today, two of which are for the women's division. The final game is Zhongbei B vs. Donghua. Since both teams have maintained undefeated records, this game is tantamount to a decisive battle, and it is expected to be exciting. The schedule for today's three games is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese - Three Provinces (Women's Division) 6:00 PM, Green Team - Liaison (Women's Division) - 6:30 PM, Zhongbei B - Donghua (Divisions A and B) 7:30 PM</p>

<p>Arts and Entertainment Fair Postponed</p>
<p>The University Alumni Advancement Association, in conjunction with various university students, is launching a grand arts and entertainment fair to support our newspaper's scholarship program. This is purely a charitable endeavor aimed at attracting the attention of the public. The enthusiastic efforts of the alumni are highly commendable. The planned entertainment program includes the drama "Joyful Reunion" and the Peking opera "The Story of the Jade Bracelet." To further enhance the event, they have specially invited various Shanghai movie stars and singers, as well as the Friendship Team's Happiness Orchestra to perform Hawaiian music. Given the grand scale of the event, a huge success is anticipated. We have learned that the association originally scheduled the performance for 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month. However, due to insufficient preparation, it has been decided to postpone the performance to 2:00 PM on March 14th, still at the Jincheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road. We hope for the understanding of all patrons.</p>
