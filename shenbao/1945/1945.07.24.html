<h3>日房總半島南方洋面　雙方艦船演砲戰　千島父島前昨遭艦砲射擊</h3>
<p>東京二十三日巾央社電　敵艦船於日本土近海之行動，漸見頻繁，二十二日下午十一時左右，形似驅逐艦之敵艦約八艘，攻擊於房總半島南方洋面航行中之日輸送船團，當與日護衛艦發生砲戰，　二十分鐘。又二十三日零時左右，日驅滑艇於父島附近發見敵潛水艦三艘，加以攻擊，敵曾於是日上午三時左右，向父島施行艦砲射擊者半小時。又於北方水域，二十二日七時餘，有艦種不明之敵艦艇七艘，向千島列島·幌筵島·擂钵山砲擊。又南鮮濟州島南方，日驅滑艦亦曾攻擊敵滑艦。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　二十二日下午十一時五十分許，護送運輪船之日軍艦艇，於房總半島南端近海，發見敵驅逐艦八艘，常即加以攻擊，交戰約歷二十分　，將其擊退，日運輪船一艘，發生輕微次災。</p>
<p>束京二十三日中央社電敵艦隊現仍蠢動於日本近海，二十二日夜半，於房總半島近海，又發現形似驅逐艦之敵艦艇約八艘，與日輸送船團之日本護衛艦艇交戰，蓋隨冲繩·馬里亞納·硫黃島等各基地敵機攻擊日本土，日趨激化。敵艦艇執拗之蠢動，除含有消減日本空軍勢力，破壞軍需生產，切斷交通綱等戰略企圖以外，亦含有宜傳謀略之企圖，蓋欲向世界誇示美艦隊已陸續於日木土近海作戰，藉收宣傳效果。第二，對日國民予以本土作戰業已迫切之威嚇印象。第三，離問日本軍民。第四，誘出日艦隊，敵之企岡，雖然如此，然其並不能收獲實質之效果。日本空軍勢力，頃以待機殲敵，觀之冲繩戰役，日木特攻機叮怖之威力，預料敵艦艇之行動必將遭受痛烈之消耗與流血。</p>
<h3>日軍航空隊猛攻沖繩基地及艦船　墜毀敵機計達八十二架</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　七月中旬以來，蠢動於日本土近海之敵機動部隊，其後雖已轉舵南下，恐尚未退去，刻仍游戈於日本近海，又敵現正積極準備馬呈亞納·硫磺·沖繩之空軍基地，同時，仍以B29·B24·P51·P38等型機，一再攻　日本土，敵此後敵之空中攻勢，亦將日趨激烈。敵機動部隊十日來裏關東地方，其後北上，十四·十五兩日攻擊東北及北海道地方之後，再茺南下，十七·十八兩日，又複攻擊東北南部關東地方，其間敵曾以擁有戰艦之一部艦艇，接近日本沿岸，砲擊室前。釜石·茨城縣專沿岸地帶，且以艦載機積累四千八百架，來裏日本土各地，日方迎擊戰果，僅由地上砲火即擊落其一百六十四架，擊戰百餘架，敵艦載機之勢力，根據來　之機數判斷，日軍　落擊毀其百分之二十。又馬里亞　之敵空軍，亦與機動部隊相呼　，B29型機陸續來　本士，攻擊中小型都市，此外，　黃島之敵P51型，專對關東·東海方面之日空軍基地猛烈攻擊，兼及日交通機關。又冲繩方面之敵軍，亦正努力建設大型機之基地，頻以戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊，來　日九州方面·舟山島·上海方面，施行戰術之攻擊，日軍航空部隊邇來日夜猛加攻擊該島基地及附近海面之敵艦船，迄至十九日，業經判明者，計擊落敵機B29型十四架，擊毀六十架，擊落P57型七架,擊毀一架。</p>
<h3>高松宇都宮昨晨空襲</h3>
<p>朝鮮海落機雷</p>
<p>大阪二十三日中央社電　敵機B29型約六十架，二十二日下午十一時半起，迄二十三日上午一時左右，攻　　　及宇都宮附近，一部於開門海峽投下機雷又另批B29型約七架，二十二日下干八時半起，經岡山中部於日本海洋上行動四小時之久</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　敵機B29型六架，二十三日上午零時半起，約歷三小時，侵入豐後水道，經下關至釜山，投下機雷。另一隊B29型七架，由高知侵入松江，於二十三日上午零時起，約歷二十分，於羅津（北朝鮮）投下機雷。</p>
<h3>日戰時食糧　準備充足</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　日本政府當局爲準備本土決戰，業確定食糧自足體制，銳力推進日本自給戰力，敵方按到此項消息後，對於日本之戰意及戰力，更加關切。二十日之華　頓星報社評認爲日本國民即將遭受肌餓者，實至謬誤也，既往之實情，暫作別論，然其現階段之食糧準備，當甚豐富，長期之配給水準，亦不致發生任何變化，又據日本當局公布之數字而觀，日本自身亦能供給戰時食糧之七成，故日本食糧問題之前途，全繫於農業勞力及運輸之機能如何而定。</p>
<h3>太平洋美軍　施行新訓練</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據倫敦來電，美陸上部隊司令部二十日發表，對新近由歐洲戰區調遺太平洋戰區之陸軍將士，決施行廣範圍之軍事新敎育，該項訓練，規定每週四十四小時，敎授一般軍事敎練，其學科內容，除以日軍所採用之戰術·兵器。軍裝並辨別標識等項外，並輸入太平洋方面美軍所用各種軍器之使用方法及　帶病預防法等。</p>
<h3>受傷美巡洋艦拖西雅修理</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據西雅　廣播，美第十三海軍管區正式發表，巡洋艦披茲布爾號，上月問在琉球東南海上爲颱風　去艦首而受傷，業已被拖至西雅圖附近船廠修理。</p>
<h3>日本國民戰意旺盛敵方謀略攻勢失敗　軍事評論家分析國際局勢</h3>
<p>滬市軍事評論家於昨（廿三）日就國際政局及日本將士與歐美將兵之優劣分析頗詳，茲分誌如次：</p>
<h3>三頭會談討論內容</h3>
<p>關於英美　三頭會談有否對日本在軍事上作新制提議？查此次英美蘇三頭會談，對於太平洋戰局定有所物　，但至今猶未　論。蓋在目前所討論者，　爲歐洲問題，刻英美蘇正對弱小國家之劃分國境問題及處理德國問題，發表各種意見，須待一致之後，方有商談太平洋問題之可能。故如今對太平洋之本格問題之討論，尙未至時機。茲據二十一日波茨坦電稱：現正討論有關賠償之問題，英美蘇三巨頭根據莫斯科之賠償委員會所會議者作爲原則，刻蘇聯提出根據雅爾達會議所決定，蘇聯應得百分之五十六比例，而英美兩國平分百分之四十四。當首次歐戰時對于德國之賠償問題，不但於德國本身，且在十年以來，在社會經濟上均受極大影嚮，故此次英美蘇雖有所協定，其結果將影響匪淺。在波茨坦化訊中所稱：三頸會議又提出巴爾幹問題，包括波蘭·奧大利·托里埃斯德·土耳其等近東各國種種問題，在茲二世紀中，巴黎　已在歐洲政冶上成爲痛　，將引起各種波濤，雖歐洲問題更迭之討論就緒，在最後之討論上，不難獲得解決，但對太平洋問題前途茫然，將來當有嚴重之風波也。在二十日，特魯曼總統於柏林近郊與艾森霍華司令長官舉行升旗禮時，特魯曼曾致簡單演說稱　美國爲和平而戰，並非爲侵略而戰，在側隨員即暗示特魯曼又加稱歐洲難不予侵略，但對太平洋則爲不同，因美國議員及將兵，均主張太平洋各島嶼，永遠爲美所佔領，由於作戰上所產生之殖民地，在國際保障問題上，美蘇亦均加以討論。</p>
<h3>三國意見未趨一致</h3>
<p>據此次　了文返渝後在參政會議席上報告對蘇交涉之經過謂：在莫斯科時與蘇最高領袖史太材及人民外交委員會莫洛托夫歷時二星期之會談，終因史太林出席三頭會談，致中後談判，故猶未達到決定之成果，於今未克報吿，俟待將來解決後，再行報吿，請予原諒云云。故此次之談判，對東亞之問題，並非易于解決，且會談至今，對日本以及太平洋上諸問題，意見至今未趨一致。茲據另外之報道所稱。或因英國內之總選舉，將　至本星期四方可休會，英之選舉約在廿五日完畢，故目前三頭會談方酣之中，過去美國將第八航空隊兵力移向太平洋上，旋又發令將該隊一部份，移赴英在德國之佔領區內，該部隊少地上部隊約十四萬人，其間一部份飛機有七百五十架，已根據二十一日所接命令而開始準備之移動，如今歐洲充滿休戰空氣，惟與英國兵力合計約二十餘萬，包括航空兵力，且仍駐屯德意志內，故其性質頓成疑問。總之，三頭會談對日本之問題，議論時機尙早，且在三國之意見一致上，深信必有隔閡不淸。</p>
<h3>美軍準備次期作戰</h3>
<p>最近美在太平洋之上調整主力航空，其趨向爲積極對日本土之登陸趣向爲積極對日本土之登陸，抑爲向巾國大陸作接岸戰？查美國確正準備下期作戰，美將陸海軍所分担之任務加以調整，且又改革指揮上之系統，即如移動歐洲兵力，以及準備兵力向何電發動，目前殊難判斷，恐敵美至今亦猶朱確定方針，如敵所主張者，爲對日本土作爲主戰，而對大陸之接岸戰，則爲支作戰，今後是否先侵攻日本土再赴大陸？或先侵大陸而後攻本土？其所採用之方法究竟如何，尙不易測斷。根據敵方所發表稱：在歐之兵力移赴美木國者，每日約四千人，共計一月達十二萬人，自五月一日至七月十一日止，所移動兵力僅十二萬以上，且航空兵力亦僅三千架以上，根據此點觀測，美在歐洲之兵移動，並非發揮預定之能力，甚且敵所作戰之方針，及所形成之基礎，在本身猶未明瞭。並據陸次柏脫遜會見新聞紀者時稱，美陸軍每日有四千人退任，而退休之陸軍兵員共計二百萬人，今預定　役新軍陣容爲八十萬，以對日本之作戰。可知美國今以最小之犧牲，企圖完成對日作戰，以保存陸軍之實力，殊難達到理想之成功。由此觀測，美在歐之兵力，能有數成可適合於對日作戰，同時美國內充滿和平空氣，不乏冀求退休之軍人，故對日本土及接岸作戰上所採之方式，不難糾像其關述之所在。敵美之作戰方向，據尼米資金凱特各長官所表示之意見，亦未能確切指出登陸之方向，即如美實行大陸接岸作戰，其指揮將官爲麥克沃塞所担任，渠與東南亞洲司令長官特巴頓曾在馬尼刺談判三日，以接岸戰爲主題，商計大陸上之如何作合。關于東南無亞洲方面，　爲　甸·馬來·泰國·越南·荷印等地，惟麥克沃塞至今仍未有所發動。</p>
<h3>日美將兵優劣比較</h3>
<p>日本將十與歐美之將兵。茲據敵美電治中將所隸屬之二十四集團軍司令部所發表稱：在冲細島北部之險要山岳地帶，潛伏日軍約有一萬人左右。按冲島北部面積佔全島三分之一，地營衝要，山　　接，敵軍對該處日軍未敢戰鬥，以避免日軍有力山岳作戰，至今該方面日軍頗多，已可證明日軍　歐美軍之作戰方式不同。又據關　合衆社　稱：在塞班。關島。迭尼安等三島上，自去年「掃蕩」日軍以來·至今始終戰鬥不懈，日軍作激烈之遊擊戰。且敵人又稱在大島島·特魯克·帛勞·那本等島上，尙有日守備隊之孤軍，冒盡艱難，作堅强之護衛守備，而在呂宋島北部之榮德哥地依仍作堅强之戰鬥，且在緬甸之庇固，日軍集中兵力，利用雨季作强烈之柢抗，餘如以昭南島爲巾心之馬來·穌門答臘·爪哇·婆羅洲·西里伯等地，日軍仍利用地帶繼續戰鬥，均以證明日軍充滿最後戰鬥之旺盛決意與歐美有所不同者，可知敵敗甘作俘虜，而日軍則聽從天命，繼續奮戰，故敵人對日軍之戰鬥，深爲懼怕，如敵在未完成大戰之準備前，以少數兵力之侵攻，即將以政治及謀略作爲攻勢，冀使日本國民減低意志，要知日本國民之旺盛戰意，絲毫不動，即至最後一士一卒，亦旺盛非當，一億國民均莫不抱定堅强之信念。</p>
<p>厘巴板方面戰況漸激烈兩軍之距離日益接近</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十三日中央社電　峇厘巴板方面之戰况，漸次激烈，兩軍之距離，日愈接近，二十日敵曾以火熖放射器爲先鋒，前來攻擊，然被日軍擊退。日軍於十七·十八兩日，飛傷敵兵約六十名。又十九日歸返基地之日軍衝鋒隊，據傳曾殲敵兵四百餘各。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>再爲救災捐款呼籲</h3>
<p>本報曾爲空襲災黎之救濟，撰文呼籲，而各方面踴躍輸將，情緒熱烈，足見社會人心未泯，眞是不幸之中的極大可喜的現象。</p>
<p>僅以本報的空襲災民救濟捐款開始以來，不過四日，收到捐款已達一萬萬元以上，不能不說是相當好的成績。而比起助學金捐款兩星期來，總計不過二千萬元，尤有此勝於彼的感想。其間最令人感佩的？要算是爰居閣主盛幼會伉儷丁厚卿金雄白孫　東諸君等之各損達千萬元之鉅，在此末世人情澆薄之際，眞是難得。</p>
<p>但是從目前空襲災民救濟中，各項丁作所需開支而論，我們目前所收到一萬萬元的捐款，在事實上仍有「杯水車薪」之嘆。所以希望本市各界市民，本有錢出錢之義，尙未捐助者，務須大量捐助，而以未出錢未出力爲一種未盡公德的奇恥大辱。而且，我們更希望自己捐助了，還要向親戚朋友勸導鼓勵，盡量捐助。難道上海有錢而能盡力公益的就只讓這幾天報上有名的少數人嗎？</p>
<p>我們深信，上海有的巨富大賈，但至目前爲止，似乎還不知救濟空襲災黎是入人應盡的天職，似乎還不知你的前後左右不少人在注視着你；看你對於這次空襲救災運動，捐出多少錢來！照我們的佔計，今日上海家產在一百萬萬元以上的，每一個但求捐出其百分之一，那麼，不僅空襲救濟工作就可以順利推進，而且其他如助學金等當前迫切需要舉辦的盡菜，也可以按照理想實現了！而實際上，在擁有百萬萬元以上家產的，捐出百令千分之一，又算得什麼大不了的犧牲呢！可是，如果你們願意捐出，你們立刻就會受到全市　論的歌頌！</p>
<p>空襲轟炸，就今日的大勢看來，今後勢必更加頻繁，市民動產不動產和生命的犧牲，常然也更將慘重。所以，我們除了不斷希望各界不必要居留上海的市民儘可能早日疏散外，便不能不擴大安襲救濟捐款運動，呼籲在滬各界有錢者大量出錢，要知道今日在上海的居民，人人有燕巢幕上的顧慮，在敵人空襲之下，人人有朝不保夕之危險；那怕你今日爲數千萬憶的巨富，炸彈是認不得什麼財神富翁的，一旦無常，金錢是贖不回生命的！但是如果大家慷慨捐輸，使救濟工作日臻完善，救濟力量日臻充實，那時一切防衛也更周密，市民的損害便可以大大的減少了。</p>
<p>願各界市民再接再厲，打破救災捐款的紀錄！</p>
<h3>美機連日　盲炸廣州市</h3>
<p>廣州二十三日中央社電　近來美機對本市，一改其從來之夜間慢性空　，以多量飛機分成數個編隊，於晝夜間作數個梯圍來襲，所投之彈，多由一百公斤至二百五十公斤之大型炸彈，而燒夷彈反大如硫酸　。且美機之投彈，絕非以軍事設施爲對象，自目濫炸市中心區及住宅區，故市民死傷甚衆，災情慘重。</p>

<h3>管翼賢發　對時局意見</h3>
<p>北平二十三四中央社電　華北政務委員會情報局長管翼賢，曾就關於「中國之統一問題」，披瀝所信如次：戰局日趨苛烈，而決戰階段亦日益迫近，中日永久結合之良機，亦在此時，是以務須實錢同盟條約，以求東亞永久共榮，以期中國統一而獲救。其第一步，須謀華北和平地區之主張與主義普遍統一，亦即繼承孫巾山先生所主張之三民主義是也。除遵重孫先生所昭示之方策外，實絕無其他方法可循。雖延安與重慶人士，其終極之目的，亦皆同爲挽救中國，據被延安軍捕去之某君稱，彼在拘禁三閱月中所受之敎育，悉爲徹底之反蔣敎育，而渝當局亦在力求打倒延安，然而現在之中國，絕不允許一黨一派之此稱鬥爭。美軍之企圖接近大陸，乃在掃除大陸之日軍，凡我國人咸須洞悉東亞乃東亞人之東亞·中國爲中國民族之中國，中國絕不容美國侵佔也。然而渝方反媚熊事美，延安則以親蘇爲反蔣抗日之後盾，在此情形下之中國，其能孑然而完成救國之使命者，惟今日之和平地區而已，此乃盡人皆知之明理也。據國父孫先生之大亞洲主義，時至今日已顯使吾人深察，若無日木即無中國之理，故中日雨國必須以保衞東亞之同仇敵愾聯結一致，待敵美接岸，華北同胞亟須傾舉全力共抗敵美，藉期負起救國之天職。</p>

<h3>渝將自美　輸入黃金　協定已成立</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　重慶訊：宋子文廿一日出席國民參政會，關於聯合國經濟援渝問題，陳述如次：余出席舊金山會議之際，曾與美政府當局間交涉以財政援渝等問題，蓋戰後各間題中之最可重視者，即爲復興中國，因此無論如何必須獲得外國之援助。戰後英美蘇加四國，均將討論予以極力援助，現下最困難之問題，即爲物價情形，爲安定渝地物價，近將由美國輸人命塊，此外與美國·巴西·墨西哥等國，締有供給衣料類之協定，該等輸入物品業已辦妥，將途經印度而運扺重慶。</p>
<p>里斯木二十三日中央社電　渝行政院長宋子文二十一日曾於參政會席上聲明，由美輸入大批金塊之協定，業經成立，關於金塊之用途，按二十一日渝美聯社電謂，該項金塊將由渝政權賣出，以收回氾濫市中之紙幣。美聯社復報稱，渝方治下之通貨膨脹程度已　極點，該政　　頃因禁止黃金買賣，致美元之暗艦頗爲昂騰，竟達一對三千之數，然現已稍形低落，而仍爲一對二千六百。接美元之公定行情爲一對一百，故依此亦叮知渝方之通貨膨脹，已如何深刻矣。</p>
<h3>渝參政會閉幕</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據重慶來電稱：第四次國民參政會，於二十日下午開第十九次會議，由宋子文報吿與史太林會談內容後，決定新駐會委負（參政曾當任委員）三十一名，至此，歷二十日間之該會議乃告閉幕。又新駐會委員中包括延安方面之董必武·第三勢力之國家社會黨領袖黃炎培·中國靑年黨領袖左舜生等三名。</p>

<h3>日本朝野深切關心</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　現在日本四周之國際情勢，對日本斷不能說有利。波次坦會談巾，如　及東亞問題，則蘇聯之態度如何，日本朝野咸表深切關心。二十三日出版之「日本產業經濟週刊」有　於此，故朝該刋之國際一週展望　，著　要求外交當局對蘇採取積極施策如此：此次於波次坦舉行之三頭會談，討論問題極多，當不能於短期內結東，預料會談吿終時所發表之聲明內容，對於日本極爲不利，此點我人必須銘記。我人對於三頭會談之推移，一方加以冷靜之注視，一方更　盡力減少此種對日不利，蓋發揮帝國之嚴刺外交？導於有利地位，無如今日之亟要也。</p>

<h3>列罪狀</h3>
<p>其後即爲長約十一項之「實事」「道德」「政治」三項主題控吿起訴文，開始宣讀，在第一項「實事」下，被吿　曾親自訂立「停戰書」，　壓制法國共和國主席之職權，　　斷大權，　延擱法國參衆兩院。</p>

<p>消息尚待證實</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　據羅馬消息：社會主義黨機關報「阿文底」於日前揭載一段有關美國官方文吿之新開，其內容略言明美當局如何處置義大利國之政策，然據倫敦官方宣稱，此項消息實不足以代表美政府之意見。茲據該項尙未證實之消息透露謂，息里內易卡將劃歸與英國，的黎波里坦尼亞將劃歸法國，厄立特利亞將劃歸阿比西尼亞，同時日前英外相艾登亦曾於衆院發表有關此項問題之公布，略謂，「息里內易卡將決不再置於義大利之治下」。</p>

<p>地方通訊</p>
<h3>閒話蓬閬</h3>
<p>— 濮溪</p>
<p>蓬閬鎭，—建築在貫流南北的瓦浦河岸邊，一半屬崑山縣，一半屬太倉縣，出買山東門二十四里便到鎭，有航船三條，每日通行兩地，離京滬鐵路的天福庵站僅九里之遙，目前人們進出，都到此站搭火車，一日一班，有航船接送，尚稱便利。由鎮向東行三十六里至嘉定，有汽車，可束達上海，西通蘇州，惟時間稍　耳。</p>
<p>人口商業</p>
<p>戰前鎮上人口約五千左右，戰後因地位偏僻，離鐵道公路稍遠，亦非水路孔道，故各地遷居而來鎭的很多；戶口劇增，頓有人滿之患，因而房屋深感缺乏，雖沒有「挖費」「小費」等花樣，然要找一個可以安頓的住所，倒也難極，戰後市面畸形繁榮，新增商店不少，營業爲附近各鄉鐘之冠，幾駕崑山而過之；惟最近一年來漸形衰落·碾米廠·米行·油坊·醬園·紗莊等各業主人，都案國積投機發了財，尤其是將當地糧食，轉運嘉定南翔，可穫厚利。然普通商店一天營業，僅够全家糊，雖籌碼愈變愈大，但存貨則一天少似一天，且捐稅繁重，花樣百出，無不呌苦連天。</p>
<p>日用洋貨，全賴單帮自上海運來；內地土充，則來自蘇州·常熟·朱家角，有「紹興船」航行各處，鎭上洋貨售價比附近各地昂貴，鎭之四周，皆係水田·菜蔬種植，尙不够農家自給，大部仰給太倉附近，故鎭上蔬菜售價，輒比上海昂貴，自物價　漲不止，巾產之家，益感生活艱困，於是家家戶戶，男女老小，全體動員，至崑山負米經鎭至外岡，嘉定出售，蓋兩地市價相差甚巨，一次得穫利萬元。</p>
<p>軍政敎育</p>
<p>地方治安，賴軍隊維持，和平軍駐紥在此，設中隊長管理之，紀律尙好；另有營察署。至於行政機關，屬崑山縣第互區，區　即設在鎭，另有鐘公所。以上各機關，除縣府經常經費外，大部取給於當地，月支六百萬元左右，尙有臨時募捐，平均每尸每月五千元，內中不無　支，民衆怨聲城道。</p>
<p>戰前　　文化水準，爲全縣各鎭之冠，人材輩出，以服務於敎育界者爲最多·滬上之中國，國華二巾學，皆係　　同鄉創辦。戰後因生活高昂，許多靑年失學，現有縣立小學一所，學生約二百名左右，女敎師佔多數，校長爲本地人，不常到校。程度低落不堪，學費上學期每人平均約四千元。</p>
<p>民風</p>
<p>一進鎮可見酒店茶館事滿座的人，　聲　拍，喧囂不絕，更有公開的秘密—「電報室」（鴉片，白麵販賣處。）在街上，常常可以碰到面如死色，「兩耳垂肩，雙手過膝」的老槍。有的是富家子弟，有的是當地顯貴除公娼而外，此地應有盡有的了。</p>
<p>董聞除烟，賭，酒充斥外，尙有二多，醫生多，糞坑多，若巡視全鎭一周，但見到處是醫生的招牌廣吿；到處是具氣四溢的　坑，居民對於衛生毫不講究的；市河裏，上游可以　馬桶，下游可以淘米，垃圾隨隨地拋棄，行人隨處便溺。鎮上有的是三年學徒出身的「國醫」，也會給人打靜脈針。</p>
<p>宗敎信仰</p>
<p>鄉人對宗敎信心很淡薄。居民大部皈依佛敎，信耶敎者極少，度水上生活之「網船人」皆信天主教，去年春問，有外鄉人在鎭設立一貫道，供彌勒佛，每月之初一，十二，月半，廿六日四天，信者必須茹素，至道中膜拜，入道之初，除繳費外，由主持人授以法語五字，不准宣怖於外人，否則將天誅地減，一時從者甚衆，惟以婦孺居多。</p>
<p>生產情形</p>
<p>四周，雖屬產米區，然土地貧　，施肥不足，耕作方法，墨守成規。因此，每年秋收，常不能滿意。去歲虫災，　畝收成平均在三·四斗左右，即常地自給，尙還不足；加以征米，走私等，農村存米一空。富農之家，賴　米度生，貧農中農，則以麥粞雜糧糊口，米價在去年底僅三萬元一石，今春二月間，漲至八萬元，最近則日增夜漲已七十萬矣！語云「　賤傷農」，今　貴極矣，然農村賴　米生活，尤形　迫。幸賴夏熟豐登，得以勉渡難關。、</p>
<p>「男耕女織」，昔時傳爲美談，我國老式布機，手推脚踏。織成布匹，門面狹窄僅一尺有零，長度最高四十尺，且花紋單調，雖能耐久，實不美勸。最近鄉間有四踏板布機，（原爲二踏板，）可織斜紋，中間雜以蠶絲，足與綫呢無別。於是家家戶戶競相仿製，但聞機聲憂憂，充滿各處，此種布匹，約値四·五萬元，視其門面　狹長短，及織工優劣而定。熟練婦女，每日織布三丈，獲利數千元，用一補貼家用。</p>
<p>靑年動熊</p>
<p>農村靑年，　尙時髦，大多游丟好閒，設　下大禍，則投入「游擊隊」，作泰山之靠，抗租抗稅，敲詐勒索，一無顧忌。村間固不乏動　之輩，然近朱者赤，耳濡目染，相習成風，於是一　風好吃懶做矣　消遣，無非麻將，偶見二三靑年，以讀小說爲樂誠風毛麟角矣。</p>
<p>報紙鄭</p>
<p>蓬　鎭與上海相隔七十餘里報紙隔日看到，有報販自安亭經望仙橋，前門塘送來。有申報，中華日報，每份四百五十元；海報每份五百元，銷路總計約百份左右。此報販係莊稼人，且沿途步行，故逢農忙或天雨，時時間斷。鎭上設有郵政代辦所，委託商店代理，外界來信，送信人向例收取捕助金每封五十元，若逢掛號，快滬或包裹，當再加倍，此款爲代辦所收人，並非郵局規定，故時起爭執。</p>
<p>荒凉的大通寺令</p>
<p>大通寺在蓬　鎭南三里。寺前有銀杏二顆，相傳　自南宋，粗約十抱高在五·六丈外，寺旁有大通橋，民二十年前，寺前銀杏，內部起火自焚，旋即救減。一時傳爲奇談，上海蘇州各地善男信女相率來寺燒香拜佛，叩賜仙丹治病，極一時之盛，歷月餘始衰，此次香資所入，將大通寺重修一通，金碧師煌，氣象雄偉「八二二」之役，全付一炬惟四周國牆尙存，銀杏無恙，春來依然絲蔭滿地。現寺內搭有草棚，供奉焚餘佛像數尊，或斷手折足，或衣　不全，一片淒涼。每年陰曆七月三十日，鄉村善男信女，皆來進杏熙　攘攘，無限熟鬧。</p>

<p>中央儲備銀行爲解除現鈔恐慌，前曾邀集各金融機關負責人，商討市面現鈔缺乏情形，及不肖同業　營現鈔貼水非法業務，　行取締矯正，經商討結果，由中儲　最按照各行莊存款比組提成領用現鈔外，並將中儲一萬，五萬，十萬三種特殊本票，取　　　，作現金流通，以　補現鈔需要之不足。茲悉該行已於昨（二十三）日起實行三種特殊本票兌行現鈔，凡市民手持一萬元，五萬元。十萬元之中儲特殊本票，可得向中儲上海分行及西區南區辦事處，暨各銀行錢莊兌取現鈔，不得拒絕兌換。</p>

<h3>當前兩大心願　救災不忘助學助學不忘救災</h3>
<p>上海富前有兩　大事，需要大家出錢出力的，第一是救濟空襲遭難的市民，第二是救濟將遭失學的青年；救災誠然是火　　毛急不容援的事，　死難的如何殉葬？受傷的如何救護？妻離子散的如何安頓？家宅損毀的如何樓息？在在需要大量經濟，纔可以籌辦，而且要繼續不斷的出錢出力。我相信處此緊急罐頭，大家看透人生觀，人人肯出力，業人人肯出錢：這就是人類最可貴的同悄心理，最叮　的互助精神</p>
<p>可是，助學僅次於救災，然而培植靑年，究屬「百年樹人」之計，亦不可等　關至。所以我說「救災不忘助學」，希望海上人士，應輸出錢出力，大部份爲救災，而分一部份爲助學，果然則左顧右盼，所謂一舉兩得，善莫大矣！</p>
<h3>家醫助學申請踴躍</h3>
<p>「家醫」助學運動，自昨日開始申請後，各校學生向男女青年會及本報索取申請書者，紛至　來，　　相接，具見諸生　心助學，殊可欣幫！茲有數點須吿明者：　本報受助生不必塡表，即於　明日（廿五）下午二時至四時半憑學　證向本館領書。　各大學，專科，及高，初中學生領得申謂書並逐項塡明後，　送交本館，或點郵四十元寄來，當於審核及格後，函寄領書證，即可憑證來館領書。　「家醫」共計十萬冊，故木館及男女靑年會方面，希望出動勸　之學生，愈多愈好，諸生儘可介紹見義勇爲之同學，共同參加。倘出動其兩千同學，平均每人銷五十本，則十萬本即可於最短時間內銷究。此於助學基金方面，可得極大助力；亦即數千淸塞學子，可蒙意外之收穫；故本報等三團體，對於「家醫」助學運動，寄予最大之熱望也。</p>

<h3>Naval Gun Battle off the Southern Coast of the Bōsō Peninsula, Japan; Father Island and the Chishima Islands Shelled</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy naval vessels are becoming increasingly active in the waters near Japan. On the afternoon of the 22nd, at around 11:00 PM, approximately eight enemy vessels resembling destroyers attacked a Japanese transport convoy sailing in the waters south of the Bōsō Peninsula, resulting in a twenty-minute gun battle with Japanese escort vessels. At around midnight on the 23rd, Japanese patrol boats discovered three enemy submarines near Father Island and attacked them. The enemy then shelled Father Island for half an hour at around 3:00 AM that morning. In northern waters, at a little after 7:00 AM on the 22nd, seven enemy vessels of unknown type shelled Horomushiro Island and Suribachi Mountain in the Chishima Islands (Kuril Islands). Additionally, a Japanese patrol vessel attacked an enemy vessel off the southern coast of Jeju Island in South Korea.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – At approximately 11:50 PM on the 22nd, Japanese naval vessels escorting transport ships discovered eight enemy destroyers off the southern tip of the Bōsō Peninsula. They immediately attacked, engaging in battle for about twenty minutes and repelling the enemy. One Japanese transport ship suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Enemy fleets continue to operate actively in the waters near Japan. At midnight on the 22nd, approximately eight enemy vessels resembling destroyers were again discovered off the Bōsō Peninsula, engaging in combat with Japanese escort vessels protecting a Japanese transport convoy. This is likely due to the increasingly intense attacks on the Japanese mainland by enemy aircraft from bases in Okinawa, the Mariana Islands, and Iwo Jima. The enemy’s persistent activity is intended to reduce Japan’s air power, disrupt military production, and cut off supply lines. Moreover, it has propaganda purposes, aiming to show the world that the U.S. fleet is operating near Japan, thus creating a propaganda effect; secondly, to give the Japanese people the impression that an invasion of the mainland is imminent; thirdly, to alienate the Japanese military and civilians; and fourthly, to lure out the Japanese fleet. Despite these aims, they will not achieve any substantial effect. Japan’s air power is currently waiting for the opportunity to destroy the enemy. Judging from the ferocity of Japanese special attack aircraft during the Battle of Okinawa, the enemy’s vessels are expected to suffer severe attrition and bloodshed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Vigorously Attacks Okinawa Bases and Ships; Eighty-Two Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy’s mobile task force, which has been active in the waters near Japan since mid-July, has since turned south, but is feared to still be lurking in the waters near Japan. The enemy is actively preparing air bases in the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. At the same time, B-29, B-24, P-51, and P-38 aircraft are repeatedly attacking the Japanese mainland. Enemy air offensives will intensify in the future. The enemy mobile task force came to the Kanto region for the last ten days, then went north and attacked the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th. Then it returned south to attack the southern Tohoku and Kanto regions again on the 17th and 18th. During this time, the enemy approached the Japanese coast with a portion of its battleships, shelling Muroe, Kamaishi, and coastal areas of Ibaraki Prefecture. It dispatched a total of 4,800 carrier-based aircraft to various locations in Japan. Japanese forces only managed to shoot down 164 and damage over 100 from ground fire alone. Based on the number of aircraft dispatched, it is estimated that the Japanese military shot down or destroyed 20% of the enemy carrier-based aircraft. Additionally, enemy air forces in the Mariana Islands are coordinating with the mobile task force, sending B-29 aircraft to attack small and medium-sized cities in Japan. The P-51 aircraft from Iwo Jima are intensively attacking Japanese air bases in the Kanto and Tokai regions, as well as Japanese transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, enemy forces in Okinawa are working hard to construct bases for large aircraft, and frequently dispatch fighter-bomber formations to the Kyushu region, Zhoushan Island, and the Shanghai region for tactical attacks. Japanese air units have recently launched fierce attacks day and night against the island's bases and enemy ships in the nearby sea. As of the 19th, it has been confirmed that 14 B-29s have been shot down and 60 destroyed, while 7 P-57s have been shot down and 1 destroyed.</p>
<h3>Takamatsu and Utsunomiya Air Raided Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Naval Mines Laid in Korean Waters</p>
<p>Osaka, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately sixty enemy B-29 aircraft attacked the vicinity of Takamatsu and Utsunomiya from 11:30 PM on the 22nd until around 1:00 AM on the 23rd. A group dropped naval mines in the Kanmon Straits. Another group of about seven B-29s operated over the Sea of Japan for four hours, passing through Okayama's center at 8:30 PM on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Six enemy B-29 aircraft entered the Bungo Channel from 12:30 AM on the 23rd for about three hours, passed through Shimonoseki to Busan, and dropped naval mines. Another group of seven B-29s entered from Kochi to Matsue, and dropped naval mines in Najin (North Korea) for about twenty minutes, starting at 12:00 AM on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Japan's Wartime Food Supplies Sufficient</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government authorities, in preparation for the decisive battle on the mainland, have established a self-sufficient food system and are vigorously promoting Japan's self-sufficiency in war materials. After receiving this news, the enemy became more concerned about Japan's war will and fighting power. An editorial in the Washington Star on the 20th claimed that it was a complete fallacy that the Japanese people would soon suffer from starvation. Leaving aside past realities, current food preparations are quite ample, and long-term rationing standards are unlikely to change. According to figures released by the Japanese authorities, Japan can supply 70% of its own wartime food needs. Therefore, the future of Japan's food problem depends entirely on agricultural labor and the functioning of transportation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Forces in the Pacific Implement New Training</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London dispatch, the U.S. Army Headquarters announced on the 20th that it would implement a wide range of new military education for army personnel recently transferred from the European Theater to the Pacific Theater. The training stipulates forty-four hours per week of general military training. In addition to the tactics, weapons, uniforms, and identification marks used by the Japanese military, the curriculum includes methods of using various military weapons used by the U.S. military in the Pacific and methods for preventing infectious diseases.</p>
<h3>Damaged U.S. Cruiser Towed to Seattle for Repairs</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – According to a Seattle broadcast, the U.S. Thirteenth Naval District officially announced that the cruiser USS Pittsburgh, which was damaged in a typhoon east-southeast of the Ryukyu Islands last month, losing its bow, has been towed to a shipyard near Seattle for repairs.</p>
<h3>High Morale of the Japanese People; Enemy's Strategic Offensive Fails; Military Commentator Analyzes the International Situation</h3>
<p>A Shanghai military commentator made a detailed analysis of the international political situation and the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese soldiers compared to European and American soldiers yesterday (the 23rd). The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Contents of the Three-Headed Conference Discussion</h3>
<p>Regarding whether the British, American, and Soviet three-headed conference has made new proposals on military strategy regarding Japan, it is certain that there has been some discussion of the Pacific war situation at this conference, but it has not been made public. At present, the discussion focuses on European issues, with the British, Americans, and Soviets expressing various opinions on the division of national borders and the handling of the German problem among smaller countries. It is only after reaching a consensus that it will be possible to discuss the Pacific problem. Therefore, it is not yet time for a full-scale discussion of the Pacific question. According to a Potsdam telegram on the 21st, the issue of reparations is currently being discussed. The three great powers are basing themselves on the principles agreed upon by the Moscow Reparations Committee. The Soviet Union is proposing that, according to the Yalta Conference, it should receive 56% of the reparations, while the United States and Britain should split the remaining 44% equally. The issue of German reparations after the First World War not only had a great impact on Germany itself but also on its socio-economic structure for ten years. Therefore, even if the British, Americans, and Soviets reach an agreement this time, the consequences will be far-reaching. The Potsdam dispatch also stated that the three-headed conference also raised the issue of the Balkans, including Poland, Austria, Trieste, Turkey, and other Near Eastern countries. Over the past two centuries, Paris has become a pain in the neck of European politics, causing various waves. Although the discussions on European issues will be completed in turn, it will not be difficult to reach a resolution in the final discussion. However, the future of the Pacific problem is uncertain, and there will be serious turmoil in the future. On the 20th, when President Truman held a flag-raising ceremony with Commander General Eisenhower near Berlin, Truman gave a simple speech stating that America was fighting for peace, not for aggression. His entourage immediately suggested that Truman should add that Europe should not be invaded, but that the Pacific was different, because American congressmen and soldiers all advocated that the islands of the Pacific should be permanently occupied by America. The United States and the Soviet Union are also discussing international guarantees for the colonies that have been created as a result of the war.</p>
<h3>The Opinions of the Three Countries Have Not Reached a Consensus</h3>
<p>According to a report from Chongqing by representatives returning after negotiation with the Soviet Union: During two weeks of talks with Soviet Supreme Leader Stalin and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in Moscow, the negotiations had to be postponed because Stalin had to attend the three-headed conference. Therefore, the final resolution was not reached. I cannot report it today, and I will report it after the resolution is achieved in the future, please forgive me. Therefore, this negotiation is not easy to resolve the problems in East Asia. Even now, opinions on Japan and the Pacific problems have not reached a consensus. According to other reports, the general election in Britain will not be adjourned until this Thursday. The election in Britain will be completed on about the 25th. Therefore, the three-headed conference is in full swing. In the past, the United States transferred the forces of the Eighth Air Force to the Pacific, and then issued an order to transfer part of the unit to the British occupation zone in Germany. This unit has about 140,000 ground troops, including about 750 aircraft, which have begun to prepare for the move according to the order received on the 21st. Now Europe is full of truce atmosphere, but it is questionable why about 200,000 troops, including aviation forces, are still stationed in Germany together with the British forces. In short, it is too early to discuss the issue of Japan at the three-headed conference, and it is believed that there must be a lack of clarity in the consensus of the three countries.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Prepares for the Next Operation</h3>
<p>Recently, the United States has adjusted its main aviation power in the Pacific. Is its trend toward landing on the Japanese mainland or toward landing on the Chinese mainland? The United States is indeed preparing for its next operation, adjusting the tasks assigned to the army and navy, and reforming the command system. It is difficult to determine at present where the mobile European forces will be deployed and which areas will be attacked. Even the enemy may not have determined their direction yet. As the enemy claims, the main battle is against the Japanese mainland, and the landing on the mainland is a supporting operation. Will they invade the Japanese mainland first and then go to the mainland? Or will they invade the mainland first and then attack the mainland? It is not easy to predict what methods they will adopt. According to enemy announcements, about 4,000 soldiers are being transferred from Europe to the United States every day, totaling 120,000 a month. From May 1 to July 11, the number of soldiers moved was only more than 120,000, and only more than 3,000 aircraft. According to this observation, the US military's movement in Europe is not发挥 the intended capacity, and the enemy's combat policy and the foundation it has formed are not clear even to itself. According to Luci Berthson's meeting with news reporters, the U.S. Army has 4,000 retirees every day, and a total of 2 million retired army personnel. Now it is planned to enroll 800,000 new army recruits to fight against Japan. It can be seen that the United States is now trying to complete the war against Japan with the smallest sacrifice, in order to preserve the strength of the army, which is difficult to achieve ideal success. From this observation, several percent of the US troops in Europe will be suitable for fighting against Japan. At the same time, the United States is full of a peaceful atmosphere, and there are many soldiers who want to retire. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the concerns of the methods adopted for the Japanese mainland and coastal landing operations. The enemy's combat direction, according to the opinions of officials such as Nimitz and Dzhinkate, also failed to clearly indicate the direction of the landing. For example, if the United States carries out a coastal landing operation on the mainland, General Mai Ke Vosse will be in charge. He and Southeast Asian Commander General Tebaton negotiated for three days in Manila to discuss how to cooperate on the mainland with coastal landing operations. The Southeast Asian region is 　Burma·Malaysia·Thailand·Vietnam·Dutch India and other places, but Mai Ke Vosse has not yet launched.</p>
<h3>Comparison of the Strengths and Weaknesses of Japanese and American Soldiers</h3>
<p>Japanese officers and soldiers compared to European and American officers and soldiers: According to an announcement by the headquarters of the 24th Army Group, which belongs to the American Army Lieutenant General, there are about 10,000 Japanese soldiers lurking in the dangerous mountainous area of northern Okinawa Island. The northern part of Okinawa Island accounts for one-third of the island's area. It is an important land area, and the mountains are connected. The enemy did not dare to fight the Japanese army in this area, in order to avoid the Japanese army's effective mountain warfare. So far, there are many Japanese soldiers in this area, which proves that the Japanese army's combat methods are different from those of the European and American armies. According to a report from Guanhe United Press, since last year, the "mopping up" of Japanese troops on the three islands of Saipan, Guam, and Dienian has been unremitting to this day, and the Japanese army is carrying out fierce guerrilla warfare. Moreover, the enemy also claimed that there are still isolated Japanese garrison troops on the islands of Grand Island, Truk, Palau, and Naban, who are enduring hardships and carrying out strong defenses. And in Rongde Ge Diyi in northern Luzon, they are still carrying out strong battles. And in Bigu in Burma, the Japanese army concentrated its forces and used the rainy season to make strong defenses. The rest, such as the Malay, Sumatran, Java, Borneo, and Celebes areas centered on Zhaonan Island, the Japanese army is still using the area to continue fighting, all of which prove that the Japanese army is full of the strong determination to fight to the end, which is different from that of Europe and the United States. It can be seen that the enemy is willing to be captured, while the Japanese army obeys the will of heaven and continues to fight. Therefore, the enemy is deeply afraid of the Japanese army's battle. If the enemy has not completed the preparations for the war, with the invasion of a small number of troops, they will use politics and strategy as an offensive, hoping to reduce the will of the Japanese people. It is necessary to know that the strong fighting spirit of the Japanese people will not move at all. Even to the last soldier, it is extremely strong, and 100 million people all have a strong belief.</p>
<p>The battle situation in Balikpapan is becoming increasingly fierce, and the distance between the two armies is getting closer.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The battle situation in Balikpapan is gradually becoming more intense, and the distance between the two armies is getting closer and closer. On the 20th, the enemy attacked with flame throwers as the vanguard, but was repelled by the Japanese army. On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese army wounded about 60 enemy soldiers. It is also said that the Japanese commando team that returned to the base on the 19th annihilated more than 400 enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-Appeal for Disaster Relief Donations</h3>
<p>Our newspaper has written articles appealing for the relief of air raid victims, and all parties have enthusiastically donated, showing a warm sentiment, which is a very gratifying phenomenon amidst misfortune.</p>
<p>In just four days since our newspaper started the air raid victim relief donation, we have received more than 10 million yuan in donations, which is a fairly good result. Compared with the scholarship donation, which totaled only 2 million yuan in two weeks, there is a feeling that this one is better than the other. The most admirable thing is that Mr. and Mrs. Sheng Youhui, Zhu Houqing, Jin Xiongbai, and Sun Yidong, etc., each donated as much as 10 million yuan, which is really rare in this era of apathy.</p>
<p>However, judging from the expenses required for various tasks in the current air raid victim relief effort, the 10 million yuan in donations we have received is, in fact, only a "drop in the bucket." Therefore, we hope that citizens from all walks of life in this city will contribute money if they have it. Those who have not yet donated must donate generously, and take it as a shameful disgrace if they have not done their public duty. Moreover, we hope that you will not only donate yourself, but also persuade and encourage relatives and friends to donate as much as possible. Is it true that only the few people named in the newspaper these days are rich enough to do their best for public welfare in Shanghai?</p>
<p>We are convinced that there are many extremely wealthy people in Shanghai, but so far, they do not seem to know that relieving air raid victims is a natural duty, and they do not seem to know that many people are watching you, looking at how much money you donate to this air raid relief movement! According to our estimation, those in Shanghai who have more than 100 million yuan in assets, if each donate only 1% of it, then not only can the air raid relief work be successfully promoted, but also other urgent needs that need to be organized, such as scholarships, can be realized according to the ideal! In fact, for those who own more than 100 million yuan in assets, what a big sacrifice is it to donate one in a thousand? However, if you are willing to donate, you will immediately receive the praise of the whole city!</p>
<p>Judging from the current trend of air raids and bombings, they will inevitably become more frequent in the future, and the sacrifice of citizens' movable and immovable property and lives will naturally become more tragic. Therefore, in addition to constantly hoping that citizens from all walks of life who do not necessarily need to stay in Shanghai will evacuate as soon as possible, we must expand the air raid relief donation movement and call on those in Shanghai who have money to donate generously. We must know that today, residents in Shanghai have the worry of a swallow's nest on a curtain, and under the enemy's air raids, everyone is in danger of perishing at any moment. No matter how rich you are today, bombs do not recognize wealth gods and rich people. Once there is an accident, money cannot redeem life! But if everyone donates generously, so that relief work becomes more perfect day by day, and the relief force becomes more abundant day by day, then all defenses will be more meticulous, and the damage to citizens can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>We hope that citizens from all walks of life will make persistent efforts to break the record of disaster relief donations!</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Bomb Guangzhou Indiscriminately for Days</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Recently, American aircraft have changed their usual slow night air raids on the city, using a large number of aircraft divided into several formations to attack in several waves day and night. The bombs dropped are mostly large bombs ranging from 100 kg to 250 kg, and incendiary bombs are as large as sulfuric acid cylinders. Moreover, the American aircraft's bombing is by no means aimed at military facilities, but indiscriminately bombing the city center and residential areas, so many citizens have been killed and injured, and the disaster situation is tragic.</p>
<h3>Prince Takamatsu Appointed President of the Japanese Red Cross Society</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the death of Field Marshal Prince Kan'in, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Prince Takamatsu has been requested to succeed him.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Holds Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Central Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party held the 259th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 23rd in the hall of the headquarters. More than 600 members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, as well as colleagues from the general headquarters and government agencies, who are members of the Kuomintang, attended. Chairman Ma Dianru presided over the ceremony, and reported on "China's Current Situation and Our Future." The ceremony ended at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Guan Yixian's Opinions on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Beiping, July 23-24 (Central News Agency dispatch) Guan Yixian, Director of the Information Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, expressed his beliefs regarding the "Unification of China" as follows: As the war situation becomes increasingly severe and the decisive stage approaches, it is also a good opportunity for a permanent union between China and Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to practically implement the alliance treaty to seek the permanent co-prosperity of East Asia, in order to achieve China's unification and salvation. The first step is to seek the unified establishment of advocacy and principles in the peaceful region of North China, which is to inherit the Three Principles of the People advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Apart from respecting the policies shown by Mr. Sun, there is absolutely no other method to follow. Although the ultimate goal of people in Yan'an and Chongqing is also to save China, according to a certain gentleman who was captured by the Yan'an army, the education he received during his three months of detention was a thorough anti-Chiang education. The Chongqing authorities are also trying hard to overthrow Yan'an. However, the China of today does not allow such struggles between parties and factions. The US military's attempt to approach the mainland is to eliminate the Japanese army on the mainland. All of our countrymen must understand that East Asia belongs to the people of East Asia, and China belongs to the Chinese nation. China will never allow the United States to invade. However, Chongqing flatters the United States, and Yan'an relies on being pro-Soviet as a shield against Chiang and Japan. In this situation, only the peaceful region of today can single-handedly complete the mission of saving the country. This is a well-known truth. According to the Greater Asianism of the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, it is now clear that we should deeply understand that there is no China without Japan. Therefore, China and Japan must unite with the same hatred and determination to defend East Asia. When the enemy US lands, the compatriots of North China must do their utmost to resist the enemy US, in order to shoulder the heavenly duty of saving the country.</p>

<h3>The Huai River Floods</h3>

<h3>Chongqing to Import Gold from the US, Agreement Established</h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) Chongqing news: Song Ziwen attended the National Political Council on the 21st and made the following statement regarding the United Nations' economic aid to Chongqing: When I attended the San Francisco Conference, I negotiated with the US government authorities on issues such as financial aid to Chongqing. The most important issue among the post-war issues is the revitalization of China. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain foreign aid no matter what. The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada will all discuss providing strong assistance after the war. The most difficult problem at present is the price situation. In order to stabilize prices in Chongqing, gold bricks will soon be imported from the United States. In addition, agreements have been concluded with the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and other countries to supply clothing. These imported goods have been processed and will be transported to Chongqing via India.</p>
<p>Lisbon, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing, stated at the National Political Council on the 21st that an agreement to import a large number of gold bricks from the United States has been established. Regarding the use of the gold bricks, according to a Chongqing-US Associated Press dispatch on the 21st, the gold bricks will be sold by the Chongqing government to recover the paper money flooding the market. The Associated Press further reported that the degree of currency inflation under the Chongqing authorities has reached its extreme. The government recently banned the trading of gold, causing the black market price of the US dollar to soar to 3,000 to 1, but it has now fallen slightly and is still 2,600 to 1. The official exchange rate of the US dollar is 100 to 1, so from this, it can also be known how deep the currency inflation in Chongqing is.</p>
<h3>Chongqing National Political Council Closes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch According to a telegram from Chongqing: The fourth National Political Council held its 19th meeting on the afternoon of the 20th. After Song Ziwen reported on the content of his meeting with Stalin, it was decided to appoint 31 new resident committee members (political council members who served as committee members).

<h3>The Three Giants of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Discuss East Asian Issues; Truman Frequently Communicates with the Country</h3>
<p>Zurich, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) The Potsdam Conference seems to be currently reviewing the East Asian issues raised by US President Truman. According to a United Press correspondent in Potsdam, Marshal Stalin and British Prime Minister Churchill have agreed with the idea of first discussing East Asian issues. The Washington correspondent for the Daily Mail also reported that Truman is consulting repeatedly with the State Department and East Asian experts by telephone almost every hour.</p>
<h3>Japan's Ruling and Opposition Parties are Deeply Concerned</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) The current international situation surrounding Japan cannot be said to be favorable to Japan. If the East Asian issue is discussed at the Potsdam Conference, the Japanese ruling and opposition parties are deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude. The "Japan Industrial and Economic Weekly," published on the 23rd, has an article on this matter. Therefore, the journal's "International Weekly Outlook" strongly urges the diplomatic authorities to adopt a proactive policy towards the Soviet Union as follows: The Three-Headed Conference held in Potsdam this time will discuss a large number of issues and cannot be concluded in a short period of time. It is expected that the content of the statement issued at the end of the conference will be extremely unfavorable to Japan. We must keep this in mind. While calmly watching the progress of the Three-Headed Conference, we must also do our best to reduce this disadvantage to Japan. Is there anything more urgent today than to exert the Empire's stern diplomacy and guide it to a favorable position?</p>

<h3>Under Heavy Guard, General Pétain to be Tried, Accused of Treason and Harming the Country</h3>
<p>Bern, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to information obtained here: The 89-year-old hero of Verdun, former French Marshal Pétain, was transferred from Fort Yetru in a police car to the Paris court yesterday afternoon, just like an ordinary criminal. At 1:00 pm today, he will be tried on the double charges of treason and harming the country. Prosecutor Monnat, who is 75 years old, strongly insisted that Pétain be sentenced to death. Madame Pétain, a prison doctor, and two female charity members accompanied the old man. When the police car drove from Montreuil to the local court, the police strictly guarded the road. Pétain was held in two small air spaces in the court, quietly waiting to be brought to the first court for questioning. Newspaper reporters were extremely disappointed because they could not all be allowed to enter. Only 400 of them were able to obtain special permits to attend. All diplomats and famous people were also forbidden to attend the trial. Five hundred officers and soldiers armed with weapons strictly guarded the doors and windows of each passage. Only when he lived in the two small rooms, the steel windows were placed high. The eagerly awaited trial period for the public over the past two weeks has finally arrived. Pétain wanted to explain how France initially surrendered. On the one hand, the prosecutor's voice trembled, and he urgently wanted to accuse him of selling the country. In front of three judges in red robes and a jury of 24 (12 representatives from the Upper House and 12 representatives from the Lower House), the two old men revealed a unique truth about how France collapsed and how it was revived. Since Louis XVI, the people of France had never seen such a heart-wrenching and tense trial. The people in Paris all said, "Pétain is on trial, and millions of French people are also on trial." Forty prosecution and defense witnesses all attended. Professor Luzhian's testimony was read aloud, and its content roughly stated, "In 1940, the envoy had a secret agreement with the British government, but the British Foreign Office has repeatedly denied it recently. At the same time, Dr. Starki, the former Swiss Foreign Minister in Vichy, also stated that it was inaccurate."</p>
<h3>List of Charges</h3>
<p>After that came the reading of a long indictment with three main themes: "Facts," "Morality," and "Politics," totaling about eleven articles. Under the first article, "Facts," the defendant personally signed the "Armistice Agreement," suppressed the powers of the President of the French Republic, cut off great powers, and delayed the French Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Under the second article, "Morality," he annexed the French Republic (it is said that Pétain had a letter to the leader of the Bao party, Moras, stating that he deeply hoped that France could restore its historical monarchical era, had a relationship with the Mibing fascist party, approached Datingte, the leader of Laider's civil army, maintained a relationship with Zaxi, the German diplomatic ambassador Buli Nong, and received Laider as the head of the French government.</p>
<p>Under the third article, "Politics," he devoted himself to accepting the name of "defeat" regardless of the shame of defeat; in 1940, when Pétain secretly accepted the cooperation between the victor and the defeated, he met with Hitler in Montoir, which damaged France's prestige; he revised the German constitution and regarded Jews as communists, used it, placed all French industries under German control, participated in military cooperation, provided French combatants to Germany, supported the organization of the French civil army, and resisted the Soviet army in East Germany; he did not allow the French army in the French bases in Syria and Tunisia to surrender to the United Nations, but instead provided the airports in Syria and Lebanon for Germany to use; he ordered the French army in the area to fire on the United Nations army, sink French warships in United Nations or neutral ports, and disregarded General de Gaulle's call, and other crimes.</p>
<h3>Thorough Reorganization of the Spanish Government</h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a telegram from Madrid: The Franco government finally reorganized the cabinet and announced the main candidates for each department on the 20th as follows: Head of Government Franco, Foreign Minister Malkin (newly appointed leader of the Catholic Party), Minister of the Army Alonde (newly appointed royalist), Minister of the Navy Regaldo (newly appointed royalist), Minister of the Air Force Galarize (newly appointed royalist), and Minister of Finance Brin (newly appointed royalist). According to the above news, the former Secretary-General of the Spanish Nationalist Party and Minister Without Portfolio Alese, the Nationalist Party opposition Foreign Minister Lek Ke, and the Minister of Justice Oos have been transferred, which is very noteworthy. In addition to the five newly joined royalists, five members of the Nationalist Party have also joined the new cabinet. From this, it can be seen that Franco's current cabinet is actually a mixed organization that draws together the Spanish royalists and various factions of the Nationalist Party to maintain its current position.</p>
<h3>Partition of Italy Plan</h3>
<p>News still awaits confirmation</p>
<p>Stockholm, July 23 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to news from Rome: The Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti" recently published a new opening of an official US document, the content of which briefly stated the US authorities' policy on how to deal with Italy. However, according to London officials, this news is not enough to represent the US government's opinion. According to the unconfirmed news, Cirenaica will be assigned to Britain, Tripolitania will be assigned to France, and Eritrea will be assigned to Abyssinia. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Eden also made an announcement on this issue in the House of Commons a few days ago, briefly stating, "Cirenaica will never be placed under Italian rule again."</p>
<h3>French Army in Syria Begins to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 22 (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a report from Damascus: The French army completely withdrew from the French barracks in Syria yesterday.

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Idle Talk of Penglang</h3>
<p>— Pu Xi</p>
<p>Penglang Town — built on the banks of the north-south flowing Wapu River, half belonging to Kunshan County and half to Taicang County. It is 24 li from Shandongmen to the town. There are three sailing boats that travel between the two places daily. It is only nine li away from Tianfu'an Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Currently, people travel to and from here to take the train, with one train a day and sailing boats for transportation, which is considered convenient. Going east from the town for 36 li reaches Jiading, where there are buses that can reach Shanghai to the east and Suzhou to the west, but the time is slightly longer.</p>
<p>Population and Commerce</p>
<p>Before the war, the town had a population of about 5,000. After the war, due to its remote location, a bit far from the railway and highway, and not a major waterway, many people moved to the town from various places. The population increased dramatically, suddenly causing overcrowding. Therefore, there is a severe shortage of housing. Although there are no tricks like "digging fees" or "tips," it is extremely difficult to find a place to settle down. The market has experienced abnormal prosperity after the war, with many new shops opening, and its business is the best among the surrounding villages, almost surpassing Kunshan. However, it has gradually declined in the past year. Owners of rice mills, rice shops, oil presses, sauce shops, and yarn shops have all made fortunes through hoarding and speculation, especially by transporting local grain to Jiading and Nanxiang, which yields huge profits. However, the daily business of ordinary shops is only enough to support the family. Although the chips are getting bigger and bigger, the inventory decreases day by day. Moreover, taxes and levies are heavy, with endless tricks, causing everyone to complain bitterly.</p>
<p>Daily necessities and foreign goods all rely on peddlers to transport them from Shanghai. Local products from the interior come from Suzhou, Changshu, and Zhujiajiao. There are "Shaoxing boats" that travel everywhere. The price of foreign goods in the town is more expensive than in the surrounding areas. The town is surrounded by rice paddies and vegetable fields, which are not even enough for the farmers to feed themselves, so they mostly rely on the vicinity of Taicang. Therefore, the price of vegetables in the town is often more expensive than in Shanghai. Since prices have been rising continuously, families with moderate incomes feel increasingly difficult to make a living. As a result, every household, men, women, old and young, are mobilized to carry rice from Kunshan through the town to Waigang and Jiading for sale, because the market prices in the two places differ greatly, and a single trip can earn tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Military Affairs, Politics, and Education</p>
<p>Local security relies on the military to maintain it. The Peace Preservation Army is stationed here, managed by a company commander, and the discipline is quite good. There is also a police station. As for administrative organs, it belongs to the Fifth District of Kunshan County, and the district office is located in the town. There is also a bell tower. In addition to the county government's regular expenses, most of the funds for the above-mentioned organs are taken from the local area, with monthly expenses of about 6 million yuan. There are also temporary donations, averaging 5,000 yuan per person per month, some of which are misappropriated, causing public resentment.</p>
<p>Before the war, the level of culture and education was the highest among all towns in the county, and talented people emerged in large numbers, most of whom served in the education sector. The China and Guohua two schools in Shanghai were both founded by fellow villagers from here. After the war, due to the high cost of living, many young people dropped out of school. There is currently a county-run elementary school with about 200 students, mostly female teachers. The principal is a local and does not often come to school. The academic level is extremely low, and tuition is about 4,000 yuan per person on average per semester.</p>
<p>Folk Customs</p>
<p>Upon entering the town, one can see hotels and teahouses filled with people, shouting and clapping, with constant noise. Even more blatant is the open secret — the "telegram room" (opium and heroin selling place). On the streets, one can often encounter old addicts with faces like death, "ears drooping to their shoulders, and hands reaching past their knees." Some are sons of wealthy families, and some are local dignitaries. Apart from public prostitutes, everything else is available here.</p>
<p>Besides the prevalence of smoking, gambling, and drinking, there are two other things in abundance: doctors and cesspools. If one inspects the entire town, one sees doctors' signs and advertisements everywhere; cesspools overflowing with stench everywhere. Residents pay no attention to hygiene; in the town's river, people can wash chamber pots upstream and rinse rice downstream, throwing garbage everywhere and urinating in public. The town is full of "national doctors" who have only three years of apprenticeship and can even give intravenous injections.</p>
<p>Religious Beliefs</p>
<p>Villagers have very little faith in religion. Most residents are Buddhists, and very few are Christians. The "net boat people" who live on the water all believe in Catholicism. Last spring, a person from another town established a Yiguandao (Way of Unity) in the town, offering sacrifices to Maitreya Buddha. On the first, twelfth, fifteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month, believers must be vegetarian and worship in the temple. At the beginning of joining the sect, in addition to paying fees, the host teaches them a five-character mantra, which is not allowed to be revealed to outsiders, otherwise they will be punished by heaven and earth. For a time, many followed, mostly women and children.</p>
<p>Production Conditions</p>
<p>Although the surrounding area is a rice-producing area, the land is poor, with insufficient fertilization, and the farming methods are outdated. Therefore, the annual autumn harvest is often not satisfactory. Last year's insect plague resulted in an average yield of about three to four dou per mu, which is not even enough for local self-sufficiency. In addition, with the collection of rice and smuggling, the countryside's rice reserves are empty. Wealthy farmers rely on selling rice to make a living, while poor and middle peasants rely on wheat bran and coarse grains to feed themselves. The price of rice was only 30,000 yuan per shi at the end of last year, but it rose to 80,000 yuan in February this spring, and recently it has been increasing day and night, reaching 700,000 yuan! As the saying goes, "cheap grain hurts farmers," now grain is extremely expensive, but the countryside relies on selling grain to live, so life is even more difficult. Fortunately, the summer harvest was abundant, so they were able to barely overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>"Men till and women weave" was once praised as a beautiful thing. Old-fashioned looms in our country are operated by hand and foot. The woven cloth is narrow, only a little over one foot wide, and the length is at most forty feet, and the patterns are monotonous. Although it is durable, it is not very attractive. Recently, there are four-treadle looms in the countryside (originally two-treadle), which can weave twill, mixed with silk, and are no different from wool. As a result, every household is vying to imitate them, and the sound of the looms fills everywhere. This kind of cloth is worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, depending on the width, length, and the skill of the weaver. Skilled women can weave three zhang of cloth a day, earning several thousand yuan to supplement their household income.</p>
<p>Youth Trends</p>
<p>Rural youth are fond of fashion and mostly idle. If they don't cause major trouble, they join the "guerrilla隊", relying on it as a backing, resisting rent and taxes, extorting and extorting, without any scruples. There is no shortage of active people in the villages, but those who are near vermilion get stained red, and they are influenced by what they see and hear, and gradually become accustomed to it. Thus, a group of people become fond of eating and lazy. Their only entertainment is mahjong, and it is rare to see two or three young people reading novels.</p>
<p>Newspaper Delivery</p>
<p>Penglang Town is more than seventy li away from Shanghai. Newspapers are delivered every other day, with newspaper vendors delivering them from Anting via Wangxian Bridge and Qianmentang. There are Shen Bao and Zhonghua Daily, each costing 450 yuan; the Shanghai News costs 500 yuan, with total sales of about 100 copies. This newspaper vendor is a farmer and walks all the way, so the delivery is intermittent during busy farming seasons or rainy days. There is a postal agency in the town, entrusted to a shop to act as an agent. Traditionally, the delivery person charges a subsidy of 50 yuan per letter for incoming mail. If it is registered, express, or a package, the fee is doubled. This money is collected by the agency and is not a postal regulation, so disputes often arise.</p>
<p>The Desolate Datong Temple</p>
<p>Datong Temple is three li south of Penglang Town. There are two ginkgo trees in front of the temple, said to be from the Southern Song Dynasty. They are about ten embraces thick and more than five or six zhang tall. Next to the temple is Datong Bridge. Twenty years ago, the ginkgo tree in front of the temple caught fire and burned from the inside, but it was quickly extinguished. For a time, it was rumored as a miracle, and pious men and women from Shanghai and Suzhou came to the temple to burn incense and worship Buddha, begging for immortal pills to cure diseases, reaching a peak for a month or so before declining. The income from incense was used to rebuild Datong Temple, making it magnificent and majestic. During the "August 13th" Incident, it was completely destroyed in a fire, leaving only the surrounding walls. The ginkgo tree was unharmed, and in spring, the ground is still covered with shade. Currently, there are thatched sheds built in the temple, enshrining several Buddha statues that survived the fire, some with broken hands and feet, or incomplete clothing, creating a desolate scene. Every year on the thirtieth day of the seventh lunar month, pious men and women from the villages come to offer apricot porridge, bustling with noise and liveliness.</p>
<p>A brief description of the current situation of Penglang is provided for readers' reference and to inform fellow villagers scattered everywhere who are concerned about their hometown.</p>

<h3>Air Raid Relief Committee Promotes Relief Fundraising Work; Medical Team to Meet This Afternoon to Discuss</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, in order to handle relief work for citizens who have suffered from air raids, has established an Air Raid Relief Committee, divided into fundraising, medical, and relief teams, and has recommended candidates for each team. It is now known that a general affairs team has been added, and Wu Junxiang, Sun Yidong, Yang Fusheng, Chen Binqian, etc., have been appointed to be responsible. Yesterday, the fundraising team and relief team of the association held meetings respectively, and the medical team is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 5:00 PM today at the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road. The minutes of the relief team and fundraising team meetings of the association yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the Relief Team</h3>
<p>The relief team held its first meeting at the Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Wang Boyuan, Chen Shaojian, Cui Pingxi, Zhao Puchu, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Riping, Li Guiyong, Shen Chuanjie, Wang Huazhao, Zhi Zhizhi, Ren Zhicun, Zhao Jinqing, etc., chaired by Zhao Puqing.

Publicly recommend Shen Chu to draft detailed rules for this organization. Publicly recommend Xiang Kangyuan to contact and handle the requisition of vehicles for emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Team Decides on Programs</h3>
<p>The fundraising team held its first meeting at Daguan Garden on Ciyun Temple Road at 4:00 PM yesterday (22nd). Attendees included Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Yunqing, Zhu Boquan, Jin Xiongbai, and representatives from all walks of life, including Zheng Peimin, Sun Xiqing, Zhang Zhongyuan, Yang Qingju, Yuan Senru, Zhang Zhesheng, Liu Feichun, Wang Shuying, Lin Zhifu, Zhu Peiqing, Wang Guizhang, Xu Zidong, Xu Guangming, Shi Jifu, Lu Zhicheng, Xie Hengkang, and dozens of others.

<h3>Central Bank of China's Three Special Promissory Notes Are Now Redeemed for Cash; Can Be Redeemed at CBC Branches and Various Banks and Qianzhuang</h3>
<p>In order to relieve the cash panic, the Central Bank of China (CBC) previously invited the heads of various financial institutions to discuss the lack of cash in the market and the illegal operations of unscrupulous colleagues in speculating on cash premiums, in order to carry out rectification and correction. After discussion, the CBC decided to issue three special promissory notes of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan, taking them out of circulation and using them as cash to supplement the insufficient supply of cash. It is now known that the bank has begun to redeem the three special promissory notes for cash from yesterday (23rd). Citizens holding CBC special promissory notes of 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan can redeem them for cash at the CBC's Shanghai branch and the West and South District offices, as well as at various banks and qianzhuang, and redemption cannot be refused.</p>
<h3>Qianye Asks for More Cash to Be Issued</h3>
<p>Because of the cash shortage, the silver and money industries in this city previously requested the Central Bank of China to issue more cash. At the end of last month, the requested amount was appropriately allocated to various banks and qianzhuang. Subsequently, the amount was gradually increased, and the cash position was slightly looser than before. It is now known that the cash issued by the CBC to the banking industry is based on the ratio of each bank's various deposits, reaching more than 5%, and there are intentions to increase it further. Therefore, various banks have respectively relaxed the weekly percentage of cash withdrawals for depositors, with the highest reaching a deposit of 1 million yuan per week, which can be withdrawn at 100%, and the minimum is also more than 20%. However, the cash used by the qianzhuang industry from the CBC accounts for only 2% of each deposit amount, making it very difficult to meet depositors' cash withdrawal needs. Depositors often complain, and some may even run away with their money. Moreover, qianzhuang are licensed by the Ministry of Finance, just like banks, but the amount of cash they can withdraw from the CBC is not treated equally with banks. Based on the above difficulties, the Qianzhuang Association has submitted a request to the CBC authorities. It is reported that the CBC considers the industry's request to be reasonable and will grant it in the near future.</p>
<h3>Central Naval Training Institute Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central Naval Training Institute held the opening ceremony for the 13th term of recruits and the 3rd term of ordinary merchant seamen at 10:00 AM yesterday (23rd) in the school's auditorium. The attendees included Yang Xibu, representative of the Minister of the Navy and Director of the Naval Headquarters in Shanghai, Chen Ruijin, Director of the Central Naval Training Institute, Miya Yoshito, Chief Instructor, and dozens of Chinese and Japanese naval officers and guests. After the ceremony, the Director appointed the graduates of the 13th term of recruits and the 3rd term of ordinary merchant seamen, and the new students paid their respects to the Director and the guests. Then Director Chen gave a speech, followed by a speech by Director Yang, representing the Minister of the Navy, urging everyone to understand that the people contribute various taxes to the country to nurture us, and we should protect the people and give society a good impression. Afterwards, Chief Instructor Miya gave a congratulatory speech, with many words of encouragement. Finally, all the students took an oath, and then sang the Navy Song in unison, declaring the ceremony complete.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market Changed to One Session</h3>
<p>According to news from the Gold Securities Market, after adjusting the business hours yesterday, and as the fourth-term gold securities have expired, they have been incorporated into the trading of expired gold securities. In order to facilitate trading, it was originally planned to open two sessions during the trading hours of the scheduled gold securities, but now it has been changed to open one session.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market Conditions</h3>
<p>After the Gold Securities Market opened yesterday, because the fourth term had expired, it was incorporated into the expired securities. As a result of the trading, due to more demand than supply, the price rose, with only five taels traded. The prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening price: 10.24 million yuan; Closing price: 10.24 million yuan, an increase of 2.04 million yuan compared to Saturday.</p>
<h3>Laozha Police Station Cracked a Forged Promissory Note Organization, Fraudulently Using Tens of Millions of Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of cash in the city, and the proliferation of payment orders and promissory notes, some unscrupulous individuals have been forging or altering payment orders and promissory notes to defraud money. The police station has repeatedly cracked down and brought them to justice. The Laozha Branch recently cracked a large forged promissory note organization, and eight suspects have been detained. Forged banknotes, documents, seals, and other forgery tools were seized on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Eight Suspects Arrested One After Another</h3>
<p>The third section of the Laozha Branch received a tip on the 18th of this month that unscrupulous individuals were forging promissory notes at No. 210 and No. 228 Tianran Hotel on Zhizhong Road and using them to defraud large sums of money. The section chief ordered police officer Yang Heping and detective Ning Tong to go to the above-mentioned locations. They first surrounded the rooms at No. 210 and No. 228, and then rushed into the rooms, arresting Yang Jinlin (40 years old, resident of No. 186 Laoshifu Road) and Li Atang (19 years old, resident of No. 62 Rongshi Road) on the spot and detaining them. Meanwhile, they sent people to wait for the main suspects to appear. The main suspects, Xu Yougen (24 years old, resident of No. 202 Daxing Road), Chen Shuikang (21 years old, resident of Lane 13, No. 214 Daxing Road), and other suspects, Yang Xiaodi, Gu Fugen, Mao Genlin, and other eight suspects, were successively arrested and taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fraudulently Used Tens of Millions of Yuan in the Market</h3>
<p>After careful investigation by Police Officer Yang and others, it was learned that the forgery of promissory notes was initiated by Xu Yougen and Chen Shuikang. The other suspects were recruited by Xu and Chen. After repeated discussions, Xu and Chen came forward to rent rooms at the Tianran Hotel and successively purchased about 100 blank promissory notes from the Shanghai Vegetable and Grain Dealers' Association. Then, they secretly engraved two seals, "Jian Kang" and "Niu Tai," and dozens of date stamps. After stamping them on the blank promissory notes, Chen Shuikang was responsible for writing the signatures, all signing "Tao Chengyan" on the notes. The amount filled in ranged from hundreds of thousands of yuan. For more than ten days, they fraudulently used them in the market, amounting to tens of millions of yuan. On that day, a payment order worth 1 million yuan that had not yet been used was also seized in the room. All the suspects confessed to the crimes they had committed. As the case is of great importance, the section is still conducting a thorough investigation and hopes that citizens will pay attention. If they have any forged promissory notes signed "Tao Chengyan," they should report to the section as soon as possible in order to compile statistics and close the case.</p>
<h3>Traffic Regulation Strengthening Week to Be Implemented Starting Tomorrow; Cracking Down on Illegal Vehicles and Pedestrians</h3>
<p>The City Police Department has found that the traffic order in the city has been deteriorating recently, with various violations and accidents involving vehicles occurring frequently. If this continues, it will not only harm the appearance of the city but also hinder traffic safety. Therefore, after contacting the military authorities, it will implement the "Traffic Regulation Strengthening Week" starting tomorrow (25th) until the 31st of this month. From 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, military police and Baojia self-defense personnel will be assigned to designated major and minor traffic points to direct traffic and crack down on illegal vehicles or pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Military Police Personnel to Be Organized and Equipped</h3>
<p>The composition and equipment are as follows: (A) Major road traffic: Two to three traffic officers from the branch, two to three police officers from the police team, eight to ten Baojia self-defense team members, and one to two soldiers. (B) Minor road traffic points: One to two traffic officers from the branch, one to two police officers from the police team, and four to five Baojia self-defense team members. Their tasks are to control traffic signals, crack down on violations of traffic regulations, and thoroughly implement various traffic rules. The equipment of the traffic police officers in command includes white-sleeved caps, batons, police whistles, and report books.</p>
<h3>Handling Violations</h3>
<p>Regarding (A) the crackdown items: Strictly adhere to left-side traffic, pedestrians should walk on the sidewalk, rickshaws and carts should travel on the left side of the curb, and motor vehicles should drive on the left side of the road in the center of the road. Thoroughly implement traffic rules and appendices. Traffic signals at intersections must be absolutely and accurately followed. (B) Handling of violators: The citizen's ID, residence permit, and driver's license of repeat offenders will be suspended at the branch and dealt with as a violation. Other violators will be fined a small amount by the branch based on the facts of the violation. However, the attitude of guiding the public should be absolutely sincere, and efforts should be made to promote traffic ethics.</p>
<h3>Road Protection Work Promotion Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Road Protection Work Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting on the second floor of the Ducheng Hotel yesterday (23rd) at 3:00 PM and held a tea party to entertain people from all walks of life. The meeting started on time. First, Yao Mou of the association reported on the preparation process, saying: "Since the preparation of this association began on May 7th of this year, three preparatory meetings have been held successively, and after more than ten group discussions, the preparatory work has been largely completed. We are deeply grateful for the assistance of all parties concerned during this period. The reasons for the formation of this association are: Unite the staff of the national railway and strive for the improvement of road administration; Promote the understanding of the importance of railways among the people along the line and integrate with them to minimize the suffering of the people; Strive to do our job well, be determined to improve, and eliminate the negative impression of society on us." Then, President Zheng of China Railway and Section Chief Okuda gave speeches with much encouragement, clarifying the mission of the Road Protection Work Promotion Association, and announcing that the association must integrate with the people in the future so that the people understand that China Railway is a tool of the people themselves and protect it. Subsequently, Wen Lanting and Yuan Ludeng gave speeches on behalf of each other, hoping that the staff of the association could earnestly work to complete their mission, facilitate transportation, and benefit the people. Finally, representatives of various social organizations gave speeches successively, and representatives of various members expressed their opinions. Then the tea party began, and everyone chatted happily until it dispersed at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Two Major Wishes at Present: Disaster Relief Should Not Forget Helping Students; Helping Students Should Not Forget Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>There are two major events in Shanghai that require everyone to contribute money and effort: The first is to relieve the citizens who suffered in the air raids, and the second is to relieve the young people who will be out of school. Disaster relief is indeed an urgent matter that cannot be delayed. How to bury the dead? How to rescue the injured? How to settle the separated wives and children? How to rebuild the damaged homes? All of these require a lot of money to prepare, and money and effort must be continuously contributed. I believe that in this emergency, everyone will see through the philosophy of life, and everyone will be willing to contribute and spend money. This is the most valuable empathy of mankind and the most admirable spirit of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>However, helping students is second only to disaster relief. Cultivating young people is a "century-long plan," and it cannot be ignored. Therefore, I say "Disaster relief should not forget helping students," hoping that people in Shanghai will donate money and effort, mostly for disaster relief, and a part for helping students. In this way, we can take care of both sides and achieve two goals at once, which is the greatest good!</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Application for "Family Doctor" Scholarship Aid</h3>
<p>Since the "Family Doctor" scholarship aid campaign began accepting applications yesterday, students from various schools have flocked to the YMCA and this newspaper to obtain application forms in an endless stream, demonstrating the students' dedication to supporting education, which is truly commendable! Several points must be clarified: Students already receiving aid from this newspaper do not need to fill out a form; they can simply bring their student ID to this office tomorrow (the 25th) from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM to collect their books. University, college, high school, and junior high school students should obtain the application form, fill it out completely, and submit it to this office, or mail it in with a forty-yuan postal fee. After the application is reviewed and approved, a book collection certificate will be mailed to them, which they can use to collect their books at this office. A total of 100,000 copies of "Family Doctor" are available. Therefore, this office and the YMCA hope to mobilize as many students as possible to promote sales. Students can introduce and encourage fellow students who are willing to help, and participate together. If 2,000 students are mobilized, and each sells an average of 50 copies, then the 100,000 copies can be sold out in the shortest possible time. This will provide significant support to the scholarship fund, and thousands of impoverished students will receive unexpected benefits. Therefore, this newspaper and the other two organizations have the greatest expectations for the "Family Doctor" scholarship aid campaign.</p>
<h3>Honorary Teams</h3>
<p>Eleventh Team: Four Seasons Cottage Team: 1,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total above: 12,000,000 yuan</p>
<h3>Ordinary Teams</h3>
<p>Sixtieth Team: Huai Ren Team: 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Sixty-first Team: Qiu Zhengcheng Team: 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Sixty-second Team: Chen Zhi Team: 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Sixty-third Team: Zheng Xingyan Team: 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total above: 900,000 yuan, bringing the previous total to 12,935,500 yuan.</p>
<p>(Note) We sincerely thank Four Seasons Cottage for their generous donation of 1,000,000 yuan to establish an honorary doctor team. The owner of the cottage's enthusiasm for supporting education is deeply appreciated. The Huai Ren Team's generous donation of 500,000 yuan is truly commendable. Mr. Qiu Zhengcheng, Mr. Chen Zhijian, and Mr. Zheng Xingyan also each sponsored a team. Their kindness is greatly appreciated. As the saying goes, philanthropists from all walks of life who have a kind heart, should do more fundraising and contribute money and effort. The motivation for doing good is the same. If we can have a new lineup, with dozens or even a hundred teams listed daily, the future of scholarship aid will be bright, which would not only benefit the colleagues of this newspaper, but also the thousands of poor students.</p>
<p>Yesterday's donations: 753 Da Shanghai Road: 60,000 yuan. Jiang Zeyitang: 30,000 yuan. Zuo Genfa, Liu Chuanhan: 50,000 yuan each. Zhou Shichang, Jia Shang School Alumni: 20,000 yuan each. Wu Yuefang, San De Tang: 10,000 yuan each. Yang Tian: 5,000 yuan. Wu Bojing: 3,000 yuan. Total above: 258,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Red Flower Café License Revoked</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Department strictly manages the operating hours of special business entertainment venues, and absolutely prohibits overtime operation. It has ordered all branch offices to strictly investigate and prohibit any violations. The Red Flower Café on Yu Yuan Road in West Shanghai was found to have repeatedly violated regulations and operated overtime, so its business license has been revoked.</p>

<p>The entire schedule of the summer basketball tournament is scheduled to end today. It will be held at the Pudong Middle School court starting at 3:00 PM.

They are equally matched. Hua Nan is led by the Liu brothers, supplemented by Zheng Yingbiao and Li Duzheng. Their skills have reached a high level. Zhen Yuan has risen recently. Ma Xiyi commands the three armies, with Huang Tianlie, Tao Zishi, He Hanfu, Sun Tianjiao, and Lu Miao, who are all extraordinary players. The battle between the two teams will be a wonderful match.

Both teams are composed of intellectuals, so there will be many spectators. In the Pressing Cup, Guan Liang Chemical will face off. The former has You Youliang accompanied by Hai Li. The latter has Ke La Sha and others. Both sides are evenly matched and there will definitely be a fierce battle.</p>
<h3>Police Officer's Extortion Case Concluded, Sentences Announced Based on Severity</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the People's Government Special Court announced the verdict yesterday (the 23rd) in the case of Battalion Commander Zong Xin and others' extortion of civilian property. A total of nine suspects were involved. After the trial, Zong Xin and five others were sentenced separately based on their crimes. The remaining two suspects, Xie Xuanjia and Shen Junyou, were acquitted because the evidence of their guilt could not be proven, and the Chairman of the National Government approved their release. Two other defendants, Li Hongchun and Wang Xiu'an, were not civil servants, so their conduct constituted robbery under Article 330, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, which does not comply with Article 1 of the Organization Regulations. Therefore, the court had no jurisdiction to sentence them. This was also discussed and approved by the President of the National Government, and they were transferred to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law. Details of the case are as follows:</p>
<h3>Criminal Events</h3>
<p>Zong Xin, a police officer from the Huashan Road Police Station in this city, at 10:00 PM on June 7th of this year, along with Zhang Wenfu, a police officer from the Changshu Road Police Station who was on the run, dressed in uniform and carrying a service pistol, and accompanied by Liu Zhenxiang, Rong Genfa, and Liu Guangyou and A Si, who were on the run, went to No. 4, Lane 537, West Road. Entering the home of Gao Liren Jinpu Kuan, who sold opium, from the back door, they intimidated him and failed. Zhang Wenfu then showed his pistol, and Liu Guangyou obtained a small cloth bag containing 5,000 yuan in cash and 10,000 yuan in bills for distribution. At about 8:00 PM on March 2nd, Zong Xin again carried a service pistol, a empty magazine, and accompanied by Liu Zhenxiang, Rong Genfa, Feng Weihai, and Lu Dekuan, who had been sentenced for robbery by the former Shanghai First Special District Local Court in February 30th and had completed his sentence in September 30th, went to No. 31, Lane 137, Zhejiang Road. Entering the home of a Korean man selling drugs, whose name is unknown, from the back door, they forcibly took a small cloth bag containing 1,800 yuan in cash and twelve small bags of morphine. They then divided it in Room 40 of the New China Hotel. Liu and Lu each received 600 yuan in cash, Qing Genfa and Feng Weihao each received four small bags of morphine, and Zong Xin received 600 yuan in cash and four small bags of morphine. Liu Xi of the Taishan Branch discovered the matter and raided the room that night. The original items were found on Liu Zhenxiang, Lu Dekuan, Rong Genfa, and Jiang Zongxin. The case was submitted to the mayor and then to the National Government for review by the court.</p>
<h3>Sentences Pronounced</h3>
<p>The court ruled that Zong Xin, in collusion and continuously seeking illegal profits, abused his power and used violence and coercion to extort property from the people, and sentenced him to fifteen years of imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If he is unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. Lu Dekuan, seeking illegal profits and abusing his power to extort property from the people, is a recidivist and is sentenced to life imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If he is unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. Liu Zhenxiang and Rong Genfa, in collusion and continuously seeking illegal profits, used violence and coercion to extort property from the people, and are each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If they are unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. Feng Weihao, in collusion seeking illegal profits and abusing his power to extort property from the people, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 yuan, and permanent deprivation of public rights. If he is unable to pay the fine, the term of imprisonment will be converted based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months. The eight small bags of morphine and the 1,800 yuan in cash are confiscated. The 15,000 yuan that has already been used is also confiscated.</p>
<h3>Zhonghe Company Solicits Real Estate for Charity Sale to Aid Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Donations for air raid disaster relief continue to pour in enthusiastically from all walks of life. Zhonghe Real Estate Company, recognizing the severity of the disaster, has solicited several plots of real estate for a charity sale: Zhu Huai Rentang donated five mu of land along the main road of Songmu Chang near West Lake in Hangzhou, with a marked price of 12,000,000 yuan per mu. Mrs. Qiu donated eight fen of residential land on the banks of Hua Xian Bridge in Nanxing Bridge, Hangzhou, with a marked price of 5,000,000 yuan. Mr. Wang donated a pond and farmland totaling nine mu and three fen in Beishan Village, West Lake, Hangzhou, with a marked price of 10,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the charity sale of the above properties will be donated in the name of the buyer to the Shanghai Municipal Citizens Welfare Association, the Pushan Villa, and hospitals that provide free treatment for air raid victims. All property certificates are currently kept by the company at 514 Fuzhou Road. Buyers can contact the company in person for consultation, and they will be sincerely informed. We hope that enthusiastic individuals will do their part and actively purchase the land to contribute to this good cause.</p>
<h3>Donations Continue to Pour In From All Sectors</h3>
<p>A letter from the staff of the Yizhong Tobacco Company of Pudong states: "Since the city suffered air raids, the bombed areas have seen families ruined, bodies abandoned on the roads, and the devastation is unbearable to witness. Post-disaster relief work depends on the active promotion of all sectors of society. Our team members, in response, have collected savings of 877,900 yuan, which we are sending to your office for use as air raid relief funds. Although this is a drop in the bucket, it is the hard-earned reward of each person. Donating is to seek peace of mind. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society and enthusiastic people will actively donate to achieve effective relief and comfort the disaster-stricken people. We cannot stop hoping."</p>
<p>A letter from the Provincial Association states: "Our colleagues, seeing that our city has suffered air raids and many compatriots have been victimized, have initiated a donation of medical and emergency supplies to help in a small way. We are enclosing a cashier's check for 730,000 yuan. Please receive it accordingly."</p>
<h3>Ding Houqing Generously Donates a Huge Sum</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Houqing, a tobacco magnate, generously donated 10,000,000 yuan for air raid disaster relief, setting the highest record for yesterday. Mr. Ding has always been generous in his support of social welfare undertakings, and this generous donation is both wealthy and benevolent, and is truly admirable. We hope that the wealthy of Shanghai will continue to step forward. We eagerly await.</p>

However, the loans must be certified by the local Baojia leader and verified to be effective. Disaster-stricken compatriots from outside the Hudong district who wish to make a small living or become self-reliant can apply to the association at No. 1, Lane 121, Zhengyang Road.</p>
<h3>Lujiawan District Sets Up Air Raid Service Stations</h3>

In the event of an air raid alarm, all team members will report to the service station nearest to them to provide service, and will liaise with nearby hospitals and ambulance stations to respond to air raid disasters and reduce damage to citizens.</p>
