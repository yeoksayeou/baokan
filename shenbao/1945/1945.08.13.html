<p>日本大本營發表　東京十二日中央社電　日大本營十二日下午三時半發表：　滿鮮方面之日軍，與滿州國軍相互協力，八月十一日對侵至東正面雄基·　春及　稜一帶與西正面海拉爾·索倫·醴泉附近之蘇軍，展開邀擊激戰中。　日潛水部隊，八月十一日下午於冲繩更南海面，攻敵運輪船團而擊沉其三艘。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日關東軍發表戰況 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>新京十二日中央社電日關東軍八月十二日十二時發表：日滿兩軍繼績邀擊各方面侵入之蘇軍，現在判明之狀况如下：</p>
<p>（甲）北鮮及間島省方面</p>
<p>侵入北鮮之敵一部份，十日侵入雄基，現被阻於雄基。羅津間。</p>
<p>十一日傍晚，一部份敵突入　春，該地軍官民全體與之展開激戰，與敵　大出血。</p>
<p>十日一部份敵突入春化。</p>
<p>該方面其他國境地區，敵未有侵寇。</p>
<p>（乙）牡丹江方面</p>
<p>日東寗守備部隊，依然繼續强烈抗戰，毀碎敵侵略。</p>
<p>自綏芬河地區北方侵入之有力敵軍，十一日夜逐次進至穆稜東北方，日軍巳完成邀擊態勢。</p>
<p>東南正面狀况不明，惟敵之侵進，到處被阻止，未有重大進展。</p>
<p>侵入三江省方面敵兵團，十一日下午漸次進至富錦　圍地區。</p>
<p>黑河省方面，敵軍於黑龍江岸被日警備軍所阻，目前各方面正派遣渡河兵隊，其後並派主力渡河，似準備向日軍抵抗地進犯。</p>
<p>海拉爾方面，日守備隊依然在敵重圍下奮鬥，與敵以重大損害，敵一部正進至哈克。</p>
<p>外蒙方面，　，十一日下午有力之敵軍先顯部隊，正進至醴泉地區。2，雨烏齊全方面之敵兵團，漸次向林西方面南下中。３，白杜正面未有重大變化。</p>
<p>敵航空部隊，以少數機於九日炸海拉爾·拉林·佳木斯，十一日炸牡丹江，毫無損失。</p>
<p>國境地區大部住民，正漸次收容於後方。</p>
<h3 id="c3">滿蘇境戰事漸告本格化 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>新京十二日中央社電　滿蘇團境全綫戰鬥，漸吿本格化，東部國境戰綫蘇軍侵入數地，日滿軍對之正展開果敢之邀擊戰。敵似謀擴大戰綫，一舉侵入東滿，故陸續調來後方兵力，以戰車爲先鋒，破國境綫一帶之民家，加以攻擊，日滿軍正到處力阻敵前進。蘇軍現已突入　春，春化等國境綫，但日滿軍仍確保陣地，加以大反攻。北部國境之戰鬥，今仍屬小規模作戰，敵之攻擊漸趨活潑，突破滿洲里三河，以海拉爾爲目標之敵，現已包圍海拉爾，進行猛攻，海拉爾日軍，正以突擊摧毀敵兵。衝破海拉爾沿鐵道綫東進中之敵，企圖侵人哈克，突被北滿之中央。又越哈爾哈川而侵入之蘇軍，與海拉爾方面相呼應，部備向林西南下，敵企圖侵入越河，遮斷日軍與華北之連絡，由此判斷，敵攻勢已趨全面化，日關東軍正於國境全綫展開邀擊中。</p>
<h3 id="c4">各地戰況 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　東亞各地一週戰况如下：　自七月下旬至八月上旬，由本土沿岸後退之敵機動部隊，其一部六日會於濟州島及其附近實施小規模之作戰，九日以約一千七百架，十六日以累計約達一千六百架之艦載機，分散攻擊東北關東地方，並有大型機亦出擊以爲呼應，日軍部隊迎擊，擊落其九十一架擊毀九十一架。日特攻隊更於九日夜，對金華山東方洋上之　機動部隊實施攻擊，證實擊毀敵大型艦一艘，　侵至馬里亞納及沖繩方面之敵空軍兵力，本周活動更見活潑，戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊約三百架，逐次來　中國地方。　　　巴板方面，三馬林達正面之戰鬥極為熾烈，敵方因日軍之猛烈反攻，其攻擊力日　消極。玻根維爾島東北方之布加島，兩軍仍展開密林戰。　海南島之日軍部隊，掃蕩該島之內殘匪，七月份所收戰果，計殺傷敵兵四百餘名，俘虜投降者四十名。</p>
<h3 id="c5">厘巴板　日軍猛反攻 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>南方基地十二日中央社電峇厘巴板方面之敵，日來於艦砲射擊與轟炸下，急於推推兵力，然因日軍之猛烈反攻，未得進展。其間日守備部隊新兵力整個反攻陣勢，於六日晨展開果敢之反攻，一方潛入敵後方之肉搏隊，殺傷敵兵一百五十名，此外，炸碎帳棚二，車輛二。六日殺到斯實千機場之肉搏隊，炸毀物資集積所，斯時塲內發生大火災，急於救火之敵兵，狼狽已極。七日以一小隊兵力於姆阿拉汀登陸之敵，因遭日軍白刃攻擊，前進受挫。又巴頓方面之敵，六·七兩日實施緩慢之砲擊及轟炸，此外，未見有何變化。</p>

<h3 id="c6">金山概貌 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 藍或</p>
<p>從松江到金山</p>
<p>從松江到金山，僅一永之隔，先乘浦南公司的公共汽車到米市渡，這程極短，約計九里，半小時可達，每日兩班，車票是四千八百元。</p>
<p>到米市渡後過江，在這兩對岸均蓋有一所茅棚，作旅客候車停憇之所，過江以後，換乘浦南經營的小汽車，在這裏搶產位，比公共汽車尤甚，因車廂狹窄，誰都深怕向隅，所以除車廂　像沙丁魚設地塞滿旅客以外，經常直外的踏板上，總要吊上六七人，這樣吊車的乘法，比較危險，也難免吃灰鹿，在別處有半價優待，而在這裏倒劃一。</p>
<p>自米市渡到金山，道路尙平，全程約十數里，將到目的地，須通過一頂長橋，底下即滔滔黃浦江水，在這裏江面頗狹，兩岸可互相接話，橋之左下角，爲平湖輪碼頭，成了水畢交通必經要道，站在橋頭，已金山在網。自米市渡到金山，車資為一萬一千元，記者日前由閔行對岸，坐小汽車至南橋（奉賢縣）亦不過十里左右，車資只五千元，乃詢賣票者昂貴理由，賣　者扮着苦臉道：「一來天氣熱，車胎易壤，二來乘白車者太多。」</p>
<p>此外交通：陸路有滬杭公路，沿海塘自柘林經金山衛通浙江，到奉賢去雖有一條公路，然在亭林一段，僑　已回，治安亦不良好，故無通車。水路有平湖班，自上海至平湖，每日對開，乘客大部份爲米販，自米糧開　後，更見擁擠。</p>
<p>與轄區</p>
<p>金山爲漁米之鄕，出產素　，地勢南北狹長，東西較廣，南瀕大海，北接松江，西連乍浦，東接靑村，地勢平坦，惟南境張堰西有泰山，爲數十公尺之小丘地，海中有金山，黃浦江橫貫北境。原名小宮鎭，淸雍正三年，升縣屬松江府，初設立金山衛，乾隆二十四年，遷縣治於朱涇鎭，滄桑幾經，舊時之城基與署址，已蕩拆無存。全縣面積九百四十方里，共分六區，五十一鄉，十二鎭，男女人口約十七二千八百餘名，以一二三區可自由統治，四五較左，六區幾全爲新四軍及忠救勢力，除朱涇外，張　，松隱，子菴等，爲該縣之大鎭。</p>
<p>地方風物人情</p>
<p>朱涇鎭是一條長街，長約二里，前後雖有街衢，却沒有那長街熱鬧。這二里長的長街上，構成當地特色的便是茶館林立，大大小小，不下十有餘家。這些茶館均設在戰前，　戰前之時，農民由於耕種所得，生活富裕，農閒無事，趕畢菜市之後，經常便到茶館去吃茶，或逗相識者坐下打牌，久而久之，遂養成一種閒散及嗜賭的習氣，現受生活高壓，此風稍減。</p>
<p>鄕婦的衣著，仍保有一種傳統的地方性風格，黑裙，白色條子短衫，婦人的袖裙比較長些，少女反之，如是打扮，與奉賢相仿。她們從鄕閒到鎭上來購物，大抵右腕裏　一個籃，裙枝翩翩，款款而步，加着健碩的體格，頗有南洋婦女的風味。說話的口音，類似松江，略帶浦東語調。</p>
<p>當地之東林寺，可謂是唯一的古蹟了，其寺建於元朝，規模頗大，內有一尊釋迦牟尼石佛，頭爲鐵質，身爲石身，看着那佛顏和然靜持的態度，對古代的彫刻藝術不能不佩服。在這裏沒有公園，有的使是一個從廢墟上良建的小球塲，另外一個說書塲所，算是點綴了全鎭的娛樂。</p>
<p>工商業及其也</p>
<p>在這鎭的長街上，商業尙稱熱鬧，以記者所過之地，其景象像奉賢南橋，比周浦稍差，比南滙繁榮，大小商店，各色俱全，門面以雙開間者爲多，行人尙往來不絕。旅館有三兩家，旅客大半爲平湖班之客商。近人民購買力薄弱，同時也因供應費浩繁，故商號頗有入不敷出之槪，營業的氣象遠不如往昔。金融業有錢莊兩家，貼現之風，比上海遜色多多。近聞鄉間之現鈔，暗中頗有人吸收，流向上海的　勢。工業使有小型稻繩廠一家</p>
<p>敎育水　在當地極低，全縣僅有初級中學一所，每區雖另有中心小學，但學生人數頗少，師資之程度，亦殊爲低劣，敎員待遇，每月俸米三斗，薪金數千元，米不一定按期拿到，因是類多抱可為不可為的態度。慈善方面，有一家救濟院，收容老弱十餘人，經費一部份募集外，其餘歸松金靑三善堂公產處貼補。現受物價高漲，收入短細，維持大感棘手。</p>
<p>鄉鎭長訓練班</p>
<p>以言合作事業，在當地雖有這樣一個設施，可是由於經營不良，僅有名無實。</p>
<p>最近當地奉令辦了一鄕鎭長訓練班，先抽調一二三區受訓，人數爲二十九人，受訓期三星期，受訓的方式，到縣報到，隨繳食米六斗，作為個人伙食之費。記者一行抵該縣時，適該訓練班將舉行結業式，記者曾前往參觀一過，訓練之課目，分保甲，黨義·地方自治·防空常識。學員都爲農民打扮，席地而臥，精神殊見健魄。</p>

<h3 id="c7">愛地方者必愛國 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 聞蘭亭</p>
<p>今天市政當局招待滬市各界領袖茶會，商討維護治安與安定民生兩事，剛才羅秘書長已經說明其意義，十分扼要，相信在座諸君對此都有同感。</p>
<p>在座諸位，都是在上海有很久歷史，有聲望又有地位，對於愛護地方，維持地方秩序，必定人人有此志願，人人非常關切的。同時，地方人民對於諸位的一言一動，也同樣的關心與重視，特別在時局動盪　言紛起的時候，地方領袖人士，對於維　治安與安定民生兩事尤須自動奮起熱忱，盡力負起責任。</p>
<p>本來，治安之維護與民生之安定，都是當局應負的責任，地方人士，只處於協力輔佐的地位。可是，一到了時局發生重大變化的時候，地方上有聲望地位歷史的領袖如能挺身而出，努力於治安與民生兩事，會比較政府的政令發生更大的效力。</p>
<p>治安和民生，是一件事的兩面，治安不良，少數人因爲輕信謠言，輕舉妄動，如果放任而不加指正，足以激起重大的不幸事件，結果民衆生活必然不能安定，因爲民衆生活的不能安定，又足以醖釀起洽安上的問題，同時難免有少數不良份子乘機搗亂，更足以引起治安上的困難問題。就這幾天的情形而論，其間有若干淺薄行動，此行彼效，結果易於造成不幸事件，所謂：「成事不足，敗事有餘」。如果政府當局與社會領袖再不出來維持秩序，眞正造成了治安上的不幸事件，實在是不値得的。</p>
<p>爲此，我們必須本愛國家的熱心，去愛護地方，由愛護地方的行動，來表明我們的愛國心。第一，我們必須糾正羣衆的輕舉妄動，使社會秩序保持平靜安寗，希望地方軍警及保甲人員共同協力戒備。第二，勸導工商各界即日恢復營業，對於散佈謠言，抬高物價者，處以擾亂市塲之罪。</p>
<p>我們深信，凡是眞正的愛國者，決不忍見地方社會之紊亂及民衆生活之痛苦，而願意挺身出來，以盡其愛護地方的責任。也惟有眞正能愛護地方者，才够得上爲愛國者。</p>

<p>民食金融問題</p>

<p>本市防空當局，因查目今尙在嚴重之戰爭狀態中，而一般市民於前晚起，對防空燈火管制竟予疏忽，甚且將防空設備予以解除，殊爲非是。故經由軍警當局重串前令，着市民繼續實施燈火管制，於每晚十時後，仍爲經常警戒燈火管制，無論商店居戶，尤其娛樂塲所，均須嚴格實施，燈光絕對不得有所洩漏，並由軍警會同自警團，組織燈火取締班，至全市各區巡查，對有遠燈火管制而燈火洩露者，當予截斷電線，予以斷電處分，且採取連坐制，附近之一保一甲，全部執行斷電，決不寬貸。故務望市民密切注意，嚴格遵照辦法，免這嚴懲。</p>

<p>週一金證劵開市，因人心不振，多頭賣出，價呈盤降，烚赤黑市跌進九千關，更使金證劵鮮少問津，收市前價梢回升，收盤爲九八〇萬元，較前週六收市小二〇萬元，五期金劵亦小九十萬元，爲八一〇萬元收盤。週二到期金證券因給赤價難高，一千關不能衝出，故而未能開做，五期券續小六十萬元爲七五〇萬元收盤。週三金證劵脫盡疲勢，買風復起，到期與五期劵均轉漲升三十萬元至三十五萬元，烚赤黑市衝出千關以上，人心向榮。週四傳出國際情勢轉變消息，資產家蟊湧傾吸到期金證券，升出一千萬元大關，收盤爲一千一百萬元，軋升八十五萬元，五期劵收盤八六五萬元升八十五萬元。週五人心仍形興奮，買戶匭續購進，價續見挺升，到期劵因烚赤黑市漲風過厲，無法開做高盤，五期劵劇漲一二五萬元，收盤軋升一二五萬元，烚赤最高一四五〇〇。週六市情更形紊亂，欲求者抬高收買，無人脫手成交，形成有價無市之局面，故結果烚赤金券均無正式行情，紋銀由五萬五千元漲至十萬元關外，銀元曾高達七關左右。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>難股市况上週聞亦受局勢之影響，人心捉摸不定，先堅穩，後狂漲，終又回平，漲跌情形頗爲複雜，買賣股票交易者，苦樂不均。週一盤旋帶堅，中型股雖見上升，而三熱門股反見疲而無神，小型股漲至限度者，仍有十七種之多。週二大中小型股上午因報銀根緊，多頭與散戶競爭出籠，展開跌風，午後傳某種刺激消息，銀根又見報鬆，人心突轉振奮，不斷猛吸，各股均致回升，且有二十餘種股票漲至限度。週三股市隨金價高勢繼續上升，一時收進口胃殊爲濃厚，漲勢漲漫，大有不可遏止之勢，一片高價買進聲，爲從來所罕見，大中小型股有九十一種漲停板。週四情勢更見狂騰，續有九十八種股票再漲停板，有購進者竟不惜照停板價暗中加價三五成，買進者比比皆是，蓋以日蘇衝突，市儈乘機拉抬股市，以吸收股票爲保持資產爲上策。週五因市政當局對於股市之狂跳，足有紊亂金融，妨害社會經濟之影響，面諭證交當局，抑制股票劇漲暴落，如有違犯法令當嚴予處治，故漲風已戢。週六以國際情勢變化，經紀人對買賣客戶催限辦理交割，多頭傾力拋出，各股狂跌，但較其他市情穩定多多，成交平平。</p>
<p>物價</p>
<p>至於工商各業方面，上週初即因大部份金股之市儈脫售金股，轉移目標，搜購食用必需品，市價因一而趨昂，米。雜糧。油。糖·麵粉均步漲，各業公司商號門售市價，一致提高五成至七成，棉織品呢絨及火柴肥皂洋燭等日用品，隨之上升，尤以下半週後漲風更厲，市面似呈極度紊亂之勢。此種情形，雖係特殊事件所影響，深望市政當局與工商各界，共襄維持整個民生治安，穩定社會經濟之責，以期抑制危局。</p>

<h3 id="c31">爲「佛敎九戶隊」告本市諸山長老 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 密迦</p>
<p>我記得去年十二月間，在申報上讀了社會福利局周毓英局長發表以篇「籲請本市僧道致力社會福利實業」文章後，我替本市諸山長老慚愧，連這一點最現實簡單的福利實業都沒有基礎來辦，也絕沒有想到辦。大概這樣過了兩個月光景，我因市佛敎會事，初次去晤周局長，當時因為胡秘書長的介紹，關於佛敎改革的問題，足足談了一小時，結語局長說：「我也是佛敎信徒，不過，和尙們自私心比較重，眞是佛敎的不幸。」雖然我們臨別的時候，局長對我個人跟期待，很勉勵，可是我的面龐已經像發燒樣的難過了。</p>
<p>最近本市接連的幾次的被轟炸，我袛聽見某寺要解散了，某廟宇著恐怕佛事情淡生活要發生問題了，有的甚至把道糧變賣預備自己逃難之需。總之，都是以自私心爲出發點，　在小圈子內轉念頭，生煩惱，絕對沒有想到這樣兵荒馬亂動盪的時代裏，我們佛敎僧徒應該做點什麼事，而平日常以「弘法是家務，利生爲實業」相標　的也都銷聲匿跡了。</p>
<p>這次市佛敎會發起空襲佛敎救護隊，開會幾次，諸山長老門似乎在勉強敷衍沒有福氣本身的責任，也滅有宗教徒對人類同情本具的那可熱枕，更缺乏團結性，每次對於公益的實業，無論經濟責任方面，都失佛教徒的精神，事變前，雖經少數善知識，如太虛大師等竭力呼籲，「多替社會服務」，然而他們的答覆是「麻木不仁」，或者冷眼的諷饑</p>
<p>事變後上海一部份的地方，因為環境錯綜複雜的關係，得到拘捕相當的繁榮，許多寺廟也有過相當時氣的黃金時代，同時還有那些佛敎淘金者也搬到這塊「冒險家的樂園」裏來，結果，老天不負有心人都「各得其所」「皆大歡喜」了，正因為這樣的關係，凡私心愈重，而對於佛敎公益心愈淡薄了，這種風氣不僅是猶太作風，簡直可以影響將來佛敎前途的發展。</p>
<p>此次市佛敎會勸吿敎徒爲空災同胞服務書內「敎主的遺訓及平日佛教徒口頭上所說的好語，是不是兌現的支票？佛敎徒是否純是自私，冷酷，沒同情心？一切的一切，現在是給我們一個最大的試金石！」還有周市長在市政諮詢委員會席上報告的「現在命運卻註定山海市民，不能不經驗這個悲慘的生活了。」而且前江北一帶佛敎被摧的殘狀，革命後俄國一切宗教被查封的情形，或許即是我們將來佛敎的反影，諸山長老們，時代已經隨戰爭而進步了，我們要爭取將來佛敎徒的地位，那末，得先爭取今日民衆佛敎的信仰心，這個唯一的方法，我們要以佛敎救世的精神來爲此時此地百苦交煎的人民服務。</p>
<h3 id="c32">疏散工作的重點 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 李鳳池</p>
<p>無論在空襲的危害間題上，在食糧的供應問題上，或其他種種問題上，疏散人口已是上海的迫切工作。</p>
<p>市府爲適應需要起見，已成立上海特別市人口疏散委員會，辦理此事。該委員會羅政各界彥碩，負疏散一百萬人口之巨責，觀乎手續之繁雜，環境之困難，確係一艱巨之工作；但以羣策羣力不屈不撓之精神處之，定卜順利證行而達理想之境，茲略陳鄙見，供諸參考。</p>
<p>事前着手辦理的預備工作：　宣傳：報紙刋物銀幕標語分頭並行，俾市民了解疏散之迫切，可能離滬者生歸鄕之念。　交通：舟車之籌劃，沿途之安全，車站碼頭之整肅，及舟車回程之如何限制與如何利用等。　目的地：目的地之準備，假定以京滬滬杭兩綫沿綫附近，及京滬杭之三角地區中各鎭集縣市爲目的，則當先注意及各該鎭市之治安及收容量之飽和點，並與各該區之軍政機關及各同鄕會取得連絡。</p>
<p>被疏散者不論團體或個人，可合分二類：</p>
<p>自願者：甲·有目的地且有能力者，給予各種助力，如車票之購得，船舶之處理，行李限量之寬放，發給證明書避免檢查之麻煩等，設上海剩有住宅家具者，必留有少數人看管，當受同樣保護勿使遭受意外損失。乙·有目的地而無能力者，依照A項幫助外，更給予經濟幫助。丙·有能力而無目的者（如上海本地人或因）旅滬甚久已與故鄉久失聯絡者）可依照項康原君之闢洞庭山爲滬民疏散區之辦法（請參閱上海市政第三期。）丁·無目的地亦無能力者，除給予各種助力外，更須酌量才力爲謀安置，以免流入歧途，此項最難處理，或可綏辦。戊·工廠移動，雖較麻煩，但對疏散效果影響甚大，一範團較大之工廠移動，必連帶數有關係之小工廠及大批工人，故有工廠欲碟移動，當盡力設法助成之。</p>
<p>强迫者：甲·善團體，慈善團體賴各界捐助以維持，設能疏散至難滬較遠處，則因米柴價廉而費用節省，太湖以西爲最理想區域，聞彼處米價，每石袛値萬元，或以彼處治安爲慮者，但慈善團體對此，實無關係也。乙·僧道可疏散至京杭國道以西山中，彼處寺觀林立，屋宇廣大，且廟產豐富，課誦之餘，兼營種植，自耕自食，最佳之法也。丙。囚犯分刑期之長短，移禁他處，詳細辦法，當由司法機關訂立之。丁·疎散至較遠之處，設法安置並分派工作，以免滋擾彼處良民。戊·學校包括中學以上各學校，移至離滬較近處，太湖之北京滬綫附近最適宜。</p>
<p>倘專請求疏散而來者不受限制，則去老自去，來者自來，或去而復來者，或來而不去者，如此，非惟效果果期，且亦枉費人力財力，故於疏散開始時，當同時施行人口入市限制，所謂限制者，決非全然斷絕來滬之途，几負販之營運，商賈之採購，即使探親望友及純係盤桓者，亦當容許入市，所限制者，惟留滬之日期耳，限制辦法：</p>
<p>停止發給由外埠來滬人民之居住證。　限制各旅社公寓對外　旅客之長期租住，規定相當期限。　限制各戶招留外埠威友之長期留居，規定相當期限，由保甲負責調查，逾限者督促離滬。　入口處設旅行證發給處，對執有非上海居住證之人民入市，以居住蹬換給旅行證，規定期限，離市時掉回，務求手續簡便，勿涉擾民之嫌。</p>
<h3 id="c33">疏散者申請現鈔防止流弊辦法 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 詩洲</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行滬行已目本六日起，正式開始試辦「回鄕者現鈔申請」工作，每人以一百萬元爲限。此外並舉辦通滙工作，裨益於本市人口疏散工作匪淺。但我人若縝密審查中儲行頒布之詳細法則，當可發現中儲所頭之辦法尙有若干重要缺點，亟應趕速設法彌補，今一一加以申論之：</p>
<p>原文第　項「疏散回鄕申請現鈔之由請人應出具舖保」。事實上該申請人如與所具舖保爲熟識者，或本人即爲該舖保之關係人時，該舖保極易與該申請人串通作弊，故舖保並非能絕對保證申請人一定返鄕或在短期內必定能返鄕。</p>
<p>又申請人並應具備「保甲移助證」，其手續爲先向保甲處塡具移出證明書然後陸續經甲長，保長聯保長警署之依序簽字蓋章後，即可據以爲申請現鈔之憑據。但該申請人於獲得上項移動證後，仍有權可以居留原處，理由爲行期未定，或尙有他事未了。是則中儲若單憑此項移動證及舖保書，遂行將現鈔發給申請人，以後即使發現是申請人無意離滬，當局亦不能因其已領得現鈔而强迫該由請人即日離滬。換言之，該申請人領得現鈔後如並不立即離滬，亦不能構成欺騙當局之罪狀，當局何從鑒別其眞僞？對其欺騙加以控訴處罰，當然更無法律上之根據，似此之狀試問若有一般頑不畏法孜孜逐利之徒，紛紛利用上項證件上之不完備，回中儲由請疏歡現鈔時，中儲是否準備以同樣待遇，對付此大批眞僞混雜之申請人？</p>
<p>其第四項原文：「申請人存入票據後三日後憑收據領取現鈔，並在存入時抄錄其居住蹬，以便事先調查防止流弊。」中儲爲此一必經手續辦妥後即可防止流弊，但試問若申請人領得現鈔後，雖經辦妥各項證明手續，而並不離滬時，中儲將用何種方法對付之？</p>
<p>爲防止弊端起見，筆者茲貢獻一補充辦法如下：</p>
<p>中儲行應即日頒佈吿示，大意謂：「凡在本行申領返鄕現鈔者，於收到現鈔後十日內應即離滬，以符本行棉力辦理「回鄉者現鈔申請」協助疏散工作之初衷。各該申請人於十日內離滬時，應即照將離滬日期繕就報告書，請本保保甲長及鄰居戶長簽字蓋章後掛號投寄本行，作爲證明，保甲長遇本保有人移出離滬時，亦請立即書面報吿本行。若本行在發付現鈔後，十日內並未接到該申請人業已在規定期限離滬之報吿，原款即應向原來舖保追還，並加倍懲處。若申請人於十日內不及離滬，則亦應即日在此規定期限內親將原款退還本行，而於決定行期時重行申請，藉杜流弊。」</p>
<p>依上次辦法辦理後，企圖取巧者必不致貪小利而寗願再見辱於各保甲長，中儲不必要之漏扈必可因此避免，唯此項辦法，還望中儲加以愼重考慮而行。</p>
<h3 id="c34">建設新公園 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>市民的健康，一半是需要豐富的食物營養，一半是需要淸潔的新鮮空氣；然而，這個　囂暄擾的上海都市，大多數的市民，朝夕窒息於食糧竄劣，和汚濁的空氣之中，不能和大自然風景相接觸，在生活驅使的勞工疲憊之餘，要覓得幾處近便的遊甜樂園（公園），無異是緣木求魚！</p>
<p>我認爲空氣的營養，較重於食物的營養，多沐紫外光綫的日光，是能够消減潛伏的細菌，多吸淸新的空氣，是能够保護肺部的健康的，如果理想中能實現許多的「新公園」，則每常春秋佳日，不論勞力階級，勞心階級，朝夕徜徉其間，身心之陶冶，精神之愉快，忘其爲生活騙使之重壓，而增進市民的身心健康，減少疾病侵襲，實有賴於多多。</p>
<p>建設新公園，地不需廣衰，但需有一草一木的空曠之區，精神亦足以有所寄託。現在的中山公園（兆豐花園）太遠，顧家宅公園又早停止開放，而外灘公園，又覺得園小人多。太嫌煩雜。最好請市政建設當局，依照愛儷園辦法，通飭許多有洋房住宅的私人花園，化私爲公，助以園藝家的技術人才和予以相當的經費補助，並派園丁佈置花木，舉凡亭台樓榭，須合乎市政管理的水準，更飭警士早晚兩次守護之。我想私人花園主人，不能欣然樂從，化私爲公，裨益市民公衆健康，福利人羣。筆者爰提出建議，希望當局採納，增進市民健康，實利賴之。</p>
<h3 id="c35">再論強化防空壕 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 戊林</p>
<p>防空壕顧名思義，當然是在空襲時，爲了保護市民的生命而建築的，照理說，市民們該如對待自已第二生命般的重視防空壕了；但事實却適得其反。目前市區內掘就的防空壕有以下數點，是亟應予以取締和改進的：</p>
<p>過去一度成爲「露天廁所所」「公共垃圾箱」的防空壕，現在更因爲沿途新添了不少賣西瓜，黃精瓜的攤頭，又不幸的成爲購食者任意拋棄瓜皮的好所在，弄得瓜皮狼藉，　集更多的懶虫；而且積纍日久，臭氣蒸發，中人欲咂。</p>
<p>從壕內掘出來大量的沙泥石子，開掘者在完工時，大都聽其散漫在壕的四周，不加整理，以致回跌到壕裏的也有不少，往往襲風至時，庫砂飛揚，迷漫全市，固有碍市街淸潔，一旦傳染病發生，市區人口本屬擁擠，更足助長流行，必至一發不可收拾。</p>
<p>市區內掘就的大小防空塚雖然已有不少，可惜大多是不能使用的，不是太淺，便是太窄，都不依照樑準大小來囘；尤其是個人防空壕，有些甚至深度只有一尺之譜，連藏個小孩都不可能。此外掘就的個人防空壕中更發現有許多的壕壁上，嵌有不少很大的石槐，這是極端危險的；要是一旦附近落下炸彈，行人倉卒走避，必不暇顧及壕中仔細，便躍身跳入，觸到這些石槐，輕傷重死，都有可能，最不應該的是那些已經遮蓋完善的大型防空壕，却未經一次使用，便已傾坍下來，其脆弱程度怎不令人望而生畏！關於防空壕的强化，筆者有管見數端，以資參考採納。</p>
<p>取締沿途賣西瓜，黃精瓜等一類的另售攤頭，否則至少亦須令其負責不使購食老拋棄瓜皮於防空壕內，違犯者得由巡邏警察或自警團員或附近居住人家扭捕房究辦。</p>
<p>由防空當局協力保甲白警員澈底淸除防空壕內污穢，此後並須永遠保持其淸潔狀態，該項工作可責成各當値自警團員負責看守，一有積水即宜汲去，一有汚穢即宜除去，可能範圍內，最好常常澆以奥藥水等一類消毒藥品，以求微生虫絕跡。自警崗交替時，應先檢查所屬防空壕一周，果無不清潔之處，然後交崗，以明職責所在。因爲空襲隨時有發生可能，防空壕便隨時要被使用，壕內的淸潔也就一刻也不容疏忽。</p>
<p>對於處理不良的或不可使用的防空壕，消極方面就索性將它塡平了，免致成爲蚊蠅孵育之塲所，且阻礙行路，積極方面，可令開掘者立刻加以改築，或加深，或放寬，或拔去石塊，或把舖散在防空壕四周的砂泥碎石和水堆砌起來，務必把它改築成眞正可以「使用的」可以「防空的」防空壕。</p>
<p>關於沿途開掘的個人防空壕以及未完成的大型防空壕，時聞有行人誤跌其中，頗以爲苦，有人主張於其附近豎一「當心險」的紅燈頭牌，以爲識別，其實殊可不必，對付未完成的防空壕，最妥當的方法當然還是趕快把它完成了，但切不可再事粗濫，以致徒勞無功。至於個人防空壕，只要於其周圍漆以一圈白色便足够辦認了；而且手續上，費用上業節省，兼且所有的大小防空壕，大都是沿着行人道邊而掘的，行路時稍予當心，誤跌的可能性是極少的。</p>
<p>每次防空演習時，防空壕避難亦應列爲訓練項目熟練於使用防空壕避難，一方面更以促進市民愛護和整潔防空壕。</p>
<p>防空當局應隨時派員巡察各處防空壕，疏忽的予以警戒，不良的予以糾正，以收完善之效。</p>
<p>在一片強化防空體制聲中，請防空當局不要遣忘了最普通而又最重要的防空壕！</p>
<h3 id="c36">推廣經濟食法 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 賫</p>
<p>在此米珠薪桂之時，我們應該處處酌量節儉；經濟食法，也就應時而生。所謂經濟食法，就是將人們一日三餐食糧，作經濟的考慮，其效果不但使所費代價較小，並且也要注重營養不減，足以充腹。依筆者之見，約可分爲下列三種：</p>
<p>實行一販二粥制在戰前米價低廉時候，一般家庭中，一日三餐可說都是飯，然而在目前，實在覺得太不經濟，所以一飯二粥制就被普遍採用了。所謂一飯二粥制，就是將早晚二餐改飯爲粥，而午餐仍吃飯。這像一來，不但米量消耗較少，並且不失營養價值。因為米是澱粉質，多吃了也沒有較多營養，反而將胃充塞結實，難以消化，不捨於衛生之道，這辦法於晚餐尤其相宜，因爲晚餐後不久就睡，改販爲粥，消化就較便了。不過這制度壞在使人容易餓，爲補救起見，我們最好將三餐間閣時間縮短些，那就可以免其弊了。</p>
<p>盡量摻用雜糧　米價固然十分貴，然而雜糧決不會比米價更貴，因為米是當作主要食品，雜糧就比較次要。例如各種豆類，麥類和麵粉，苞米和苞米粉，他們的營養成份都不比米少，因為他們都含豐富的維他命。例如吃了赤豆，可以除濕免生脚氣病；吃了緣豆，可以淸涼，免發痧生婕；麥類和苞米含小粉質很多，磨成粉末後，消化和吸收都成容易，所以雜糧的效用可說值得注意，希望大家實行摻用雜糧，那未米的消耗可以節約多了。</p>
<p>每月中指定數日單吃雜糧　雜糧的功用，旣有如上述，就是味道也是很好，我們在一月中指定數日，或每星期中指定任一月爲吃雜糧日，決不需要米。例如這星期日吃赤豆湯，下星期日吃緣豆湯，以後就吃麵條，苞米粉餅等，照此類推，這樣一則換換口味，二則將食糧依賴米的傳統習慣打破，可說一舉二得。</p>
<p>上述三種辦法，筆者曾親自體驗，第一種辦法行之已久，已成習慣，並不覺得不便，法而促進消化作用。第二種辦法，筆者家裏實行早餐麥片或苞米粉，中餐摻赤豆或豇豆，晚餐普通以午餐餐飯煮成泡飯，這樣以來，身體確實較前健康，這可由行路時腳步輕捷而知。至於第三辦法，食法甚多，除前述外，近又有吃馬玲薯（洋山芋），其法以馬鈴薯加猪油葱而燒煮，味旣香美，消化又易，實是別具風味之食品，大家不妨試試。</p>

<p>Shinkyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kwantung Army announced at 12:00 PM on August 12th: The Japanese and Manchukuo armies continue to repel the Soviet forces invading on all fronts. The currently confirmed situation is as follows:</p>

<p>In the Heihe Province area, the enemy army is being blocked by the Japanese garrison army on the banks of the Heilong River. Currently, units are being dispatched to cross the river on all fronts, and subsequently, the main force will be sent across the river, seemingly preparing to attack the Japanese army's resistance areas.</p>
<p>In the Hailar area, the Japanese garrison troops continue to fight fiercely under heavy enemy siege, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. A portion of the enemy is advancing to Hak.</p>
<p>In the Outer Mongolia area: 1. On the afternoon of the 11th, a strong enemy vanguard unit was advancing towards the Reishi area. 2. The enemy forces in the Yiwuqi area are gradually moving southward towards Linxi. 3. There have been no major changes on the Baidu front.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Manchurian-Soviet Border War Gradually Becoming Full-Scale <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Shinkyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The fighting along the entire Manchurian-Soviet border is gradually becoming full-scale. In the eastern border war, the Soviet army has invaded several locations, and the Japanese and Manchukuo armies are engaging in a courageous defensive battle. The enemy seems to be planning to expand the battle lines and invade eastern Manchuria in one fell swoop, so they are continuously transferring rear forces, using tanks as the vanguard, breaking through civilian houses along the border and attacking. The Japanese and Manchukuo armies are doing everything possible to block the enemy's advance. The Soviet army has now broken into the Chun and Chunhua border lines, but the Japanese and Manchukuo armies are still securing their positions and launching a major counterattack. The fighting on the northern border is still small-scale warfare, but the enemy's attacks are gradually becoming more active. The enemy, who broke through Manzhouli Sanhe and aimed for Hailar, has now surrounded Hailar and is carrying out a fierce attack. The Japanese army in Hailar is using a surprise attack to destroy the enemy troops. The enemy who broke through Hailar and advanced eastward along the railway line, attempting to invade Hak, was suddenly struck by the center of northern Manchuria. Furthermore, the Soviet army that crossed the Halaha River and invaded, echoing the Hailar front, is preparing to move south towards Linxi. The enemy is attempting to invade the Yuehe River, cutting off the connection between the Japanese army and North China. From this, it can be judged that the enemy's offensive has become all-out, and the Japanese Kwantung Army is conducting a defensive battle along the entire border.</p>
<h3 id="e4">War Situation in Various Locations <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The war situation in various locations in East Asia for the past week is as follows: From the end of July to the beginning of August, a portion of the enemy's mobile forces, which had retreated along the mainland coast, converged on Jeju Island and its vicinity on the 6th to carry out small-scale operations. On the 9th, they used approximately 1,700 carrier-based aircraft, and on the 16th, a cumulative total of approximately 1,600 carrier-based aircraft, to attack the northeast Kanto region in a dispersed manner. Large aircraft also launched attacks in support. The Japanese army units engaged them, shooting down 91 and destroying 91. On the night of the 9th, the Japanese special attack force also attacked the enemy's mobile forces in the sea east of Mt. Kinhua, confirming the destruction of one large enemy ship. The enemy air force that invaded the Mariana and Okinawa areas was even more active this week. Combat bomber joint formations of approximately 300 aircraft gradually came to the Chugoku region. In the Balikpapan area, the fighting on the Samarinda front is extremely fierce. Due to the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army, the enemy's attacking power is gradually weakening. On Bougainville Island northeast of Buka Island, the two armies are still engaged in jungle warfare. The Japanese army units on Hainan Island are mopping up the remaining bandits on the island. In July, the battle results were the killing or wounding of over 400 enemy soldiers and the capture of 40 who surrendered.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Fierce Japanese Counterattack in Balikpapan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Southern Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – The enemy in the Balikpapan area has been eagerly pushing its forces under naval gun fire and bombing, but due to the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army, no progress has been made. Meanwhile, the Japanese garrison unit's new forces launched a bold counterattack from the entire counterattack formation on the morning of the 6th. A melee squad that infiltrated the enemy's rear killed or wounded 150 enemy soldiers. In addition, two tents and two vehicles were blown up. On the 6th, the melee squad that killed at Sepinggan Airport destroyed the material accumulation site. At that time, a large fire broke out in the airfield, and the enemy soldiers who were eager to put out the fire were extremely embarrassed. On the 7th, the enemy who landed at Muara-Angin with a small team of soldiers had their advance thwarted due to a Japanese bayonet attack. Furthermore, the enemy in the Patton area carried out slow shelling and bombing on the 6th and 7th, but otherwise, no changes were seen.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Overview of Jinshan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Huozhi</p>
<p>From Songjiang to Jinshan</p>
<p>From Songjiang to Jinshan, there is only a Yong's distance apart. First, take the Punan Company's bus to Mishidu. This journey is extremely short, about nine li, and can be reached in half an hour. There are two buses a day, and the ticket price is 4,800 yuan.</p>
<p>After arriving at Mishidu, cross the river. On both banks, there is a thatched shed for passengers to wait for the bus and rest. After crossing the river, take the Punan-operated car. Competing for a seat here is even worse than on the bus, because the car is narrow, and everyone is afraid of being left behind. Therefore, in addition to the carriage being crammed with passengers like sardines, there are often six or seven people hanging on the outer pedals. This method of hanging on the car is more dangerous and inevitably gets covered in dust. In other places, there is a half-price discount, but here it is uniform.</p>
<p>From Mishidu to Jinshan, the road is still flat, the entire journey is about ten li. When approaching the destination, you must pass over a long bridge, and below is the turbulent Huangpu River water. Here, the river is quite narrow, and the two banks can talk to each other. At the lower left corner of the bridge is the Pinghu Wharf, which has become a necessary route for water transportation. Standing on the bridgehead, you can see Jinshan at a glance. From Mishidu to Jinshan, the fare is 11,000 yuan. The reporter recently took a car from the opposite bank of Minhang to Nanqiao (Fengxian County), which is only about ten li, and the fare was only 5,000 yuan. So, I asked the ticket seller the reason for the high price. The seller said with a bitter face: "First, the weather is hot, and the tires are easily damaged. Second, there are too many people riding on white cars."</p>
<p>In addition to transportation: on land, there is the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, which runs along the coast from Zhalin through Jinshanwei to Zhejiang. Although there is a highway to Fengxian, the overseas Chinese have returned in the Tinglin section, and the security is not good, so there is no through traffic. By water, there is the Pinghu bus, which runs between Shanghai and Pinghu every day. Most of the passengers are rice merchants. Since the opening of the rice trade, it has become even more crowded.</p>
<p>And Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Jinshan is a land of fish and rice, and its products have always been abundant. The terrain is narrow and long from north to south, and wider from east to west. It is bordered by the sea to the south, Songjiang to the north, Zhaopu to the west, and Qingcun to the east. The terrain is flat, but in the southern territory of Zhangyan, there is Mt. Tai in the west, a small hill of dozens of meters. In the sea, there is Jinshan Island, and the Huangpu River runs across the northern border. It was originally called Xiaogong Town. In the third year of the Qing Yongzheng period, it was promoted to a county under the jurisdiction of Songjiang Prefecture. Jinshanwei was first established. In the twenty-fourth year of Qianlong, the county seat was moved to Zhujing Town. After several changes, the old city base and government site have been demolished and no longer exist. The entire county covers an area of 940 square li, divided into six districts, 51 townships, and 12 towns, with a male and female population of approximately 172,800. Districts 1, 2, and 3 can be freely governed. Districts 4 and 5 are more left-leaning. District 6 is almost entirely controlled by the New Fourth Army and the Zhongjiu forces. In addition to Zhujing, Zhangyan, Songyin, and Zian are the county's large towns.</p>
<p>Local Customs and Culture</p>
<p>Zhujing Town is a long street, about two li long. Although there are streets before and after, they are not as lively as that long street. The characteristic of this two-li-long street is the tea houses, large and small, no less than ten. These tea houses were all established before the war. Before the war, farmers were wealthy due to their farming income. When they had nothing to do during the slack season, they often went to the tea houses to drink tea or sat down to play cards with acquaintances. Over time, they developed a habit of idleness and gambling. Now, under the pressure of high living costs, this trend has decreased slightly.</p>
<p>The clothing of the rural women still retains a traditional local style: black skirts, short white striped shirts. The sleeves and skirts of married women are longer, while those of young women are the opposite. This kind of dress is similar to that of Fengxian. When they come to town from the countryside to shop, they usually carry a basket in their right wrist, and their skirts flutter as they walk gracefully. With their strong physiques, they have the flavor of Southeast Asian women. The accent is similar to Songjiang, with a slight Pudong intonation.</p>
<p>The Donglin Temple in the area can be said to be the only historical site. The temple was built in the Yuan Dynasty and is quite large in scale. Inside is a stone Buddha of Sakyamuni, with an iron head and a stone body. Looking at the Buddha's calm and peaceful attitude, one cannot help but admire the ancient carving art. There is no park here. What there is is a small ball field rebuilt from the ruins, and another storytelling venue, which can be considered to embellish the entertainment of the whole town.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce and Others</p>
<p>On this long street in the town, commerce is still lively. In the places the reporter has passed, the scene is like Nanqiao in Fengxian, slightly worse than Zhoupu, but more prosperous than Nanhui. Large and small shops are complete with all kinds of goods. Most of the storefronts are double-spaced. Pedestrians still come and go endlessly. There are three or two hotels, and most of the travelers are merchants on the Pinghu bus. Recently, people's purchasing power is weak, and at the same time, the cost of supplies is huge, so many businesses have found it difficult to make ends meet, and the business atmosphere is far from what it used to be. There are two money houses in the financial industry, and the trend of discounting bills is much less than in Shanghai. It has recently been heard that cash in the countryside is being secretly absorbed by many people, and there is a trend of flowing to Shanghai. The only industry is a small rice rope factory.</p>
<p>The level of education is extremely low in the area. There is only one junior high school in the entire county. Although there is another central primary school in each district, the number of students is quite small, and the level of teachers is also very low. Teachers are paid three dou of rice and several thousand yuan per month. The rice is not necessarily received on time, so many hold a do-or-die attitude. In terms of charity, there is a relief center that houses more than a dozen old and weak people. Part of the funding is raised, and the rest is subsidized by the Songjinqing Three Charity Hall's public property office. Recently, due to rising prices and shortfalls in income, it has been very difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Township Mayor Training Class</p>
<p>Speaking of cooperative undertakings, there is such a facility in the area, but due to poor management, it is only in name.</p>
<p>Recently, the local government ordered the establishment of a township mayor training class, first selecting trainees from Districts 1, 2, and 3, with a total of 29 people. The training period is three weeks. The training method is to report to the county, and then pay six dou of rice as the cost of personal meals. When the reporter and his party arrived in the county, the training class was about to hold a graduation ceremony. The reporter went to visit it. The training courses were divided into Baojia, Party Ideology, Local Autonomy, and Air Defense Common Sense. The trainees were all dressed as farmers, sleeping on the floor, and their spirits were very healthy.</p>
<p>On behalf of the theory</p>
<h3 id="e7">Those who love the local area must love the country <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Lanting</p>
<p>Today, the municipal authorities hosted a tea party for leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to discuss two matters: maintaining public security and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Secretary-General Luo has already explained the significance, which is very concise. I believe everyone present has the same feeling.</p>
<p>Everyone here has a long history in Shanghai, has prestige, and has a high position. Everyone must have the desire to protect the local area and maintain local order, and everyone is very concerned about it. At the same time, the local people are also equally concerned and pay attention to every word and deed of everyone, especially when the situation is turbulent and rumors are rife. Local leaders must take the initiative to rise up with enthusiasm and do their best to take responsibility for maintaining public security and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Originally, the maintenance of public security and the stability of people's livelihoods are the responsibilities that the authorities should bear, and local people are only in a position to cooperate and assist. However, when a major change occurs in the situation, local leaders with prestige, status, and history can come forward and work hard on public security and people's livelihoods, which will have a greater effect than the government's decrees.</p>
<p>Public security and people's livelihoods are two sides of the same thing. If public security is poor, a small number of people will easily believe rumors and act rashly. If it is allowed to go unchecked and not corrected, it will be enough to trigger a major unfortunate event. As a result, people's lives will inevitably be unstable. Because people's lives cannot be stabilized, it is enough to brew problems in public security. At the same time, a small number of bad elements will inevitably take the opportunity to make trouble, which is enough to cause difficult problems in public security. Judging from the situation in the past few days, there have been some superficial actions, and this action has followed suit, which easily leads to unfortunate events. As the saying goes, "Insufficient to accomplish anything, more than enough to spoil things." If the government authorities and social leaders do not come out to maintain order, and a truly unfortunate public security event is created, it is really not worth it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must use the enthusiasm of loving the country to love the local area, and express our patriotism through the action of protecting the local area. First, we must correct the rash actions of the masses and keep the social order calm and peaceful, hoping that the local military police and Baojia personnel will work together to prepare for this. Second, we should persuade the industrial and commercial circles to resume business immediately, and those who spread rumors and raise prices should be punished for disturbing the market.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that all true patriots will never bear to see the chaos in the local society and the suffering of the people, and are willing to come forward to fulfill their responsibility to protect the local area. Only those who can truly protect the local area are worthy of being patriots.</p>

If anyone misinterprets the true meaning of the military, takes adverse actions on public security, or insults the authority of the Japanese army, the military will take decisive action."</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial today, pointing out that the entire Japanese nation should be united under His Majesty the Emperor, with a hundred times the courage, to overcome the sad fate. It said in brief that the country has reached a juncture of national survival, which has never been encountered in three thousand years. Distant events such as the foreign troubles of Bunji and Hongan, and recent events such as the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, although they all plunged the country into difficulties, were not as severe as today. So, what is the national attitude in dealing with this difficult situation? Japan has an unparalleled national polity united under His Majesty the Emperor, and everything is issued by the Holy One, which goes without saying. For nearly two thousand years since the founding of the country, the way of the monarch and ministers has been fixed, the direction of the country is clear and unwavering, and there must be one and only one key step for the country. In the face of this greatest difficulty since the founding of the country, compatriots throughout the country can only have a hundred times the courage, only have the utmost sincerity to reflect on themselves and practice self-discipline, and when compatriots hold the firm belief that the Divine State will not perish and have the conviction to maintain the national polity, each individual ego can be united with the long-standing great ego, the individual will be annihilated and merged with the whole, and at this point, a belief in mutual trust and harmony will naturally arise. The individual is a unified phenomenon of the whole. The seriousness, depth, and duration of the national disaster facing compatriots are really difficult to measure. At this time, how can we still hesitate and be indecisive? We can only face it with unwavering unity. The most important thing to avoid at this time is being careful and suspicious, hesitating, and internal strife. The post-war national life should be a completely unparalleled phenomenon. Only by the country's courageous and decisive efforts to overcome the misfortune can we reserve the only way to build a glorious future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – As Japan faces an unprecedented difficult situation, Tokyo newspapers are all vigorously advocating the spirit of upholding the national polity and the direction that the nation should take. "Asahi Shimbun" published the leading news on the right side of the 12th, with the title "Uphold the Imperial Heart and Achieve the Duty of a Child," in a four-segment position. "Mainichi Shimbun" also published a chronicle titled "The Great Justice of Eternity." The first chronicle of "Asahi Shimbun" is recorded below: "Since the beginning of its history, the Japanese nation has encountered many trials, overcome them, and become a strong country, and the people have achieved today's prosperity. Our ancestors used calm and decisive means to open the thorny road. In several national disasters, the fate of the country and the people, both external and internal, has repeatedly presented the danger of a stacked egg, and they have entered a chaotic stage where they do not know which direction to go or how to deal with it, but they only know to rely on the Japanese national spirit and act in unison. The heart of His Majesty the Emperor is the heart of God. By following the orders of His Majesty the Emperor, they opened the way to life from death. Our ancestors have opened such difficulties several times, and today's Japan conveys this spirit to us at the same time. The fact that the Soviet Union unilaterally announced that it should go to war against us and started military operations, and that Britain and the United States used the atomic bomb, starting the most violent massacres in human history that have never been seen before, have made the war situation since the fall of Saipan through the Philippines and Okinawa even more significant. Today's fact that it has entered the worst possible state has been frankly admitted by the Director-General of the Information Bureau, and the situation can be said to have reached the final juncture. In order to protect the national propriety and preserve the nation's honor, and to defend the last line, what is required of the entire nation, including military officers and civilians, at this stage is that our ancestors have always calmly faced reality, have always dealt with matters decisively, and that they live for the sake of being a child of His Majesty, and His Majesty expects the nation not to violate this purpose, to eliminate personal selfishness, and only then can they exert the national spiritual power of returning the favor with seven lives, and combat power will gush forth. At this final juncture, our army must inherit the legacy created by our ancestors in adversity, and fulfill the duty of being a child of His Majesty. If we can fulfill this point, then no matter how much more difficult it becomes in the future, the foundation of the Japanese nation will not be shaken in the slightest."</p>

<h3 id="e17">The British Also Express Indignation Towards Inhumane Weapons <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Zurich, Central News Agency, 12th – According to a London Exchange Telegraph dispatch: On the 9th, various London morning newspapers published that the general public was filled with indignation regarding the inhumane weapon, the atomic bomb. For example, one reader of the Chronicle requested that "the scientists who dedicated themselves to this demon of human slaughter should be executed immediately." Furthermore, according to a political reporter for the Daily Mail, the Labor Party’s condemnation of the use of the atomic bomb was particularly vehement. Attlee's coming into office so soon encountering such a difficult situation is not a good omen. It is also unknown whether Attlee will be asked to explain the extent to which the British government agreed to the decision to use the atomic bomb. Furthermore, Attlee will be asked to guarantee that atomic bombs will not be used in future operations against Japan, or even in future wars.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Beijing – The Ministry of Interior met with reporters on the 11th, with Director of Land Administration Zhang Shizheng representing the ministry to announce the following overview of the ministry's policies:</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Matters</p>
<p>During the "cleansing" period in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality, all delegated administrative regions were simultaneously returned to their respective jurisdictions, starting from the second half of this year (July 1). Two areas of Jurong County in Jiangsu Province were placed under the jurisdiction of Jiangning County. The organizational law of the Haizhou Municipal Government of Huaihai Province was amended.</p>
<p>Land Administration Matters</p>
<p>Regarding applications for tax deeds by foreigners, the ministry, together with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Industry, previously drafted two sets of measures: 1. Citizens of countries without treaties and stateless persons may rent houses for residence within recovered concessions but may not rent land. This restriction does not apply to those who have been naturalized and obtained Chinese citizenship. 2. Those who have already obtained land through mortgage or perpetual lease must transfer it to Chinese citizens within a limited time. If they encounter danger, the local government will reclaim it. An order was received approving the amendment to Article 4 of the Tax Regulations drafted by the Ministry of Finance. The return of land and houses to former owners was handled. The application for registration by the Xuzhou Huaihai Housing Co., Ltd. was reviewed in conjunction with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry. It was decided that, according to the regulations of various concessions and commercial ports regarding the land rights of foreigners obtaining Chinese legal person status, current laws do not restrict general real estate businesses. As this pertains to company registration, it falls under the management of the Ministry of Industry, to be handled at its discretion.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Municipal Government's Measures for Air Defense in Schools at All Levels <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government issued the following air defense implementation measures for schools at all levels on the 7th of this month:</p>
<p>Section 1: The Focus of School Air Defense</p>
<p>In addition to carrying out all orders issued by the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters regarding air defense matters, schools at all levels in this city, fearing that the environment and facilities of each school may not be fully complete and that the danger of air raids is considerable, should pay particular attention to the following key points of school air defense: protection of students, protection of important documents, books, instruments, and research materials, and protection of school buildings.</p>
<p>Section 2: Air Defense Preparations</p>
<p>Each school should organize students into several teams based on age, address, and grade level, and distinguish between "staying at school" and "returning home" types so that they can be assembled at any time. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Staying-at-School Team: 1. Limited to high school students in the second and third grades and above who live near the school. 2. Distant or young students entrusted by their parents to stay at school (a letter of entrustment should be obtained).</p>
<p>(B) Returning-Home Team: 1. Divided into several teams according to the direction of students' addresses (the address of each student should be thoroughly investigated in advance to prepare for team formation). 2. Each large team is further divided into several small teams.</p>
<p>(C) After the formation of each team, attention should be paid to the speed of assembly, not exceeding one minute.</p>
<p>(D) Stipulate the location for the general assembly of each team. This location must be in a relatively safe location with specific signals and walking routes.</p>
<p>(E) Notify the parents of the students in detail of these implementation measures in writing, explaining whether the student will stay at school or return home immediately when an alarm sounds, and ask the parents of the students to answer the following points: 1. The parents agree that their child will stay at school and take on protection work (this is limited to high school students in the second and third grades and above who live near the school). 2. The parents agree that their child will return home immediately on their own. 3. The parents request permission for their child to wait temporarily at the school until someone from home arrives to pick them up and accompany them home (if there is such a request, the person picking up the child must come to the school immediately after hearing the alarm). 4. For students living far away (the journey from school to home takes more than 20 minutes), please have the parents designate relatives or friends living nearby (name and address) where the student can go to take refuge on their own (still considered to be returning home on their own). 5. For students living far away (the journey from school to home takes more than 30 minutes), and the parents cannot designate relatives or friends living nearby for refuge, they request the school to arrange for them to be taken to a shelter.</p>
<p>Within three days, all glass windows in each room of the school must be covered with "well-shaped" strips of paper two centimeters wide. The paper should preferably be cellophane or kraft paper and must be pasted on the inside.</p>
<p>This pasting work should be done jointly by teachers, students, and employees during art classes.</p>
<p>The school should have sufficient equipment for water, yellow sand, medicine, and various firefighting tools. The quantity should be based on the needs of each school. The cost should be raised by each school and should not be collected from students. The Education Bureau or the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters may send personnel to inspect at any time.</p>
<p>Each student must clearly state their name, grade, and home address on their collar.</p>
<p>The school building should be sturdy, and one place inside the school should be designated as the school's shelter. If there is a shelter near the school, it should also be contacted in advance to prepare for evacuation, so it is not necessary to designate a place inside the school.</p>
<p>Kindergarten, primary school, junior high school, and first-year high school students should not be assigned air defense duties. However, second- and third-year high school students should be given air defense training and encouraged to participate, but participation is not compulsory if their parents do not agree.</p>
<p>Schools should regularly explain air defense knowledge and measures to be taken during air raids to students, and hold exercises at least once a month.</p>
<p>Section 3: Organization of the School Air Defense Team</p>
<p>In order to strengthen air defense preparations, each school should establish its own school air defense team. Its organization and system are as follows:</p>
<p>The school air defense team should have a team leader and a deputy team leader, each, who should be assumed by the principal or a director and a physical education teacher, respectively. They will be in charge of all school air defense matters. The team should have the following groups:</p>
<p>(A) Shelter Guidance Group: With one group leader, assumed by a teacher, and one employee to assist, the group is responsible for guiding "staying-at-school students" to evacuate to shelters or waiting for evacuation.</p>
<p>(B) First Aid Group: With one group leader, assumed by a teacher, and several members, the members are composed of teachers, school employees, and volunteer second- and third-year high school students who stay at school to take on air defense work. The group is responsible for first aid for the sick and injured, as well as the preparation and management of first aid supplies and materials.</p>
<p>(C) Fire Prevention Group: With one group leader, assumed by a teacher, and several members, the members are composed of teachers, school employees, and volunteer second- and third-year high school students who stay at school to take on air defense work. The group is responsible for implementing firefighting, managing firefighting equipment, and removing dangerous items.</p>
<p>(D) Surveillance and Security Group: With one group leader, assumed by the head of administrative affairs or a clerk, and several members composed of gatekeepers, school employees, and on-campus staff, the group is responsible for aerial surveillance, control of lights and sounds, and inspecting and storing all lighting control equipment.</p>
<p>(E) Important Material Transportation Group: With one group leader, concurrently assumed by the deputy team leader, the members are composed of teachers, administrative staff, school employees, etc., and are responsible for transporting important materials.</p>
<p>(F) Student Escort Group (Limited to Primary Schools and Kindergartens):</p>
<p>1. Divided into several large teams based on the direction of children's addresses, each with a team leader, assumed by a teacher, to escort the children out of the school and line up to a designated location.</p>
<p>2. Each large team is further divided into several small teams, with senior children serving as small team leaders to escort the children home.</p>
<p>(G) Telephone Message Group: With one team leader, assumed by a teacher, and several members composed of teachers and school employees, the group is responsible for intelligence, inquiries, entrustments, and relaying alarms, and must maintain close contact with the local neighborhood association, police station, and fire department (limited to fires).</p>
<p>The names of the personnel of the above groups must be displayed in a conspicuous place in the school. However, schools below the university level can reduce the number of groups or merge groups.</p>
<p>Section 4: Implementation of School Air Defense</p>
<p>When an alert or alarm is issued, preparations for air defense should begin immediately without any further delay. The details are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Alarm Occurs Before Students Go to School: When a warning or emergency alarm occurs before students have gone to school, parents should instruct their children not to go to school for the time being and should wait until the alarm is completely lifted and it is safe before going to school. However, the school authorities must not consider students absent or on leave. If students encounter an alarm while on their way to school, they should immediately return home or enter a nearby shelter and must not linger on the street.</p>
<p>(B) Alarm Occurs After Students Arrive at School: When an alarm sounds, air defense status should begin immediately, and the principal or other responsible personnel should take the following actions:</p>
<p>1. Immediately issue an order to suspend classes. 2. Implement the general assembly of each team. 3. Except for the "staying-at-school team" students, who are led by the shelter guidance group leader to the shelter, the "returning-home team" students are immediately led by the leader of the student escort group to send each team back home. 4. Under the command of the school air defense team leader, each group begins its own work, striving to achieve calmness, agility, and decisiveness. 5. If it is an air defense drill, classes can continue after the general assembly of teams.</p>
<p>(C) Alarm Occurs While Students Are on the Way Home from School: When a warning alarm sounds and school has already been dismissed and students are on their way home, if they are close to home, they should return home immediately; if the journey is still far, they should quickly enter a nearby shelter and must not linger on the street.</p>
<p>(D) Alarm Occurs Outside of the School's Scheduled Hours: When an alarm is issued, all personnel regularly stationed at the school should take the following actions: 1. The school air defense team leader, deputy team leader, group leaders, and personnel on duty must immediately go to the school. 2. When an alarm is issued, if it is at night, lighting control should be implemented immediately. 3. The person in charge must maintain contact with the police station, neighborhood association, and fire department and be under their command. 4. Command the staff living on campus to engage in the activities, with particular emphasis on rescue, fire prevention, surveillance, and security, and removal of important materials. 6. Direct team members who come to the school to work. 7. Students at home must not go to school until the warning alarm is lifted.</p>
<p>(E) Precautions for the General Assembly of Teams: When an alarm is issued, each team should quickly assemble and prepare for action.</p>
<p>The matters to be noted by students and teachers are described separately below: Student side: Stay in the team. Be quiet. Act swiftly. Two people in a row, holding hands (limited to primary school and kindergarten students). Do not gather in the corridor; form a team in the classroom and walk out. Keep to the left. Like meeting on the road. When two levels meet, the level in the front moves first. Place desks and chairs back in their original positions in the classroom. All doors and windows in the classroom should be opened. Do not carry any books or supplies. Teacher side: Command all actions of students. Lead students to the "team assembly point". Bring the register to check the number of people. Immediately engage in various activities of the school air defense team after the "returning-home team" students leave the school.</p>
<p>(F) After an Alert Alarm, an Emergency Alarm (i.e., an Air Raid Alarm) is Issued: 1. Personnel of the school air defense team should immediately handle the following tasks: Telephone Message Group: Immediately convey the alarm to all personnel in the school to ensure accuracy and speed. Surveillance and Security Group: The person in charge of lighting control should immediately implement air raid control (at night) and pay attention to whether all indoor windows are open. After completing the above tasks, quickly go to the designated shelter to hide. 2. All other personnel staying at school should go to the designated shelter to hide.</p>
<p>(G) An Emergency Alarm is Issued Suddenly Without a Warning Alarm (When an emergency alarm suddenly occurs after the police intelligence report is issued, and the expected work has not yet been completed, it should be handled in the same way as this item).</p>
<p>1. If an emergency alarm is issued within the school's scheduled hours, the principal and other school officials should take the following actions:</p>
<p>Immediately issue an order to suspend classes. Quickly implement the general assembly of teams. Except for the "staying-at-school team", the principal or other school officials should make careful observations. If the journey home for students is within five minutes, they should be ordered to return home (previously stipulated). All personnel of the school air defense team should immediately engage in the prescribed work. Other personnel in the school should immediately lead them to the designated shelter to take refuge.</p>
<p>2. If an emergency alarm is issued outside of the school's scheduled hours, the following actions should be taken: Personnel of the school air defense team, such as the team leader, deputy team leader, group leaders, and members (pre-arranged duty roster), must immediately go to the school to engage in air defense work. Other personnel must assist in air defense matters at home.</p>
<p>3. If an emergency alarm is issued on the way to school or on the way home from school, the following actions should be taken: Take refuge in a nearby shelter and must not linger on the street.</p>
<p>Section 5: Measures to be Taken in the Event of Air Raid Damage</p>
<p>The leader of the school air defense team should adapt to the situation and seek the cooperation and mutual assistance of each group.</p>
<p>The person in charge of aerial surveillance in the surveillance and security group must pay attention to the direction of the enemy plane's bombing and quickly report to the team leader. The surveillance and security group personnel, if they find incendiary bombs falling, should immediately shout loudly or knock on copper or iron utensils to inform the fire prevention group to rush to rescue. Even if no bombs are seen falling, they must carefully check toilets, patios, under beds, storage areas, etc. for any damage.</p>
<p>When an incendiary bomb falls, the fire prevention group should immediately call the fire department and the police station.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of incendiary bomb, the first priority is to put out the fire immediately.</p>
<p>In the event of a fire, efforts should first be made to prevent the spread of the fire, and then to extinguish the burning location.</p>
<p>If there is a sound of bombing nearby during firefighting, immediately lie flat on the ground or use a nearby shelter to avoid harm.</p>
<p>If the school building is in danger of spreading fire, the doors and windows should be closed immediately.</p>
<p>If the fire is too large and initial firefighting is difficult, immediately call the fire department and the police station for assistance.</p>
<p>When there are casualties, the first priority is to rescue them from danger, administer the minimum amount of first aid, and quickly escort them to the first aid location.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Municipal Government Invited Social Leaders to a Cordial Tea Party Yesterday to Discuss Issues Such as Stabilizing People's Livelihood and Public Security <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>In order to discuss the issues of stabilizing the people's livelihood and public security in this city, the Municipal Government specially invited social leaders of this city to hold a cordial discussion at 5:30 p.m. yesterday (12th), hosted by Secretary-General Luo Jian. The attendees included Wen Lanting, Huang Jinrong, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Li Sihao, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Boquan, Pei Yunqing, Tang Shoumin, Shen Siliang, Chen Binhe, Jin Xiongbo, Xu Xiaochu, Huang Xuanping, Zhang Weiru, Tang Xinghai, Wang Boyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Guanqun, Wu Zhenxiu, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Riping, Gu Nanqun, Zhu Rutang, and more than 20 other people.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo delivered a speech first, saying: "Today, Mayor Zhou invited everyone to discuss the public security and livelihood issues of this city, but due to diarrhea and fever, he was unable to attend in person. I am honored to attend on his behalf. Thank you very much for attending. The Municipal Government will make every effort to maintain the public security of this city. This time, the Municipal Government has specially joined forces with the Security Headquarters and mobilized all police, neighborhood watch personnel, self-defense team members, security inspector brigades, and security special task forces to put forth effort to strictly maintain the public security of the entire city. In addition, although the Municipal Government has various countermeasures for livelihood issues such as finance, food, and prices in this city, we hope that everyone will cooperate and work together for the stability of the people's livelihood in this most difficult period. As for the phenomena of a few citizens acting rashly the other day, it is even more regrettable. We also hope that everyone will use their status as social leaders to guide and correct them and maintain order and tranquility."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Wen Lanting delivered a speech (the speech can be found in this newspaper's editorial). Mr. Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Zhang Weiru, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Wang Boyuan, and others expressed their opinions on issues such as finance, markets, food, and the resumption of business in the city. Deputy Secretary-General Hu and Director of the Economic Bureau Liu successively reported on various countermeasures such as food. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Food and Finance Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the food issue in this city, the Municipal Government has considered countermeasures and decided to ensure that the source is sufficient and stabilize the people's livelihood. Liu Xingchen, Director of the Economic Bureau, reported that household flour and miscellaneous grains will be shipped and distributed to citizens soon. A large amount of flour and rice will be transported to Shanghai from other counties in the near future for adjustment. There is no need to worry about the future of food.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the market opening for trading, the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the Gold Securities Market will resume normal business operations from today (13th).</p>
<p>In terms of stabilizing finance, silver and money houses will operate as usual from today (13th). At the same time, they will continue to handle small loans but will refuse loans for speculative purposes.</p>
<p>Regarding the resumption of business for various stores, the Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will separately convene meetings of representatives from various industries. The Economic Bureau will convene a meeting of major trade associations at 11:00 a.m. today (13th), and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will reconvene a meeting of all directors and supervisors this afternoon (13th) to discuss and promote the full resumption of business. At the same time, Director Liu and Chairman Yuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce both deeply hope that all industries and residents in the city will abide by the intentions of the authorities and strive to economize on consumption and avoid unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>On the 11th, the China Revitalization Corporation donated 100 million yuan in cash and 300 million yuan in medicine to the Municipal Government for the purpose of relieving the wounded and affected people of the air raids. It entrusted the Municipal Welfare Association to distribute them. Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the Municipal Government made a special report at the meeting to express his deep gratitude to the spirit of the Allied nations' love for Chinese friendship. He hoped that the association would distribute them appropriately and live up to their good intentions.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Air Raid Precautions: Strict Enforcement to Continue; Military and Police Authorities Reiterate Previous Orders <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Due to the ongoing severe state of war, the city's air defense authorities have noted a growing negligence among citizens regarding air raid lighting control since the night before last. Some have even dismantled air defense equipment, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the military and police authorities have reiterated previous orders, directing citizens to continue implementing lighting control measures. After 10:00 PM each night, regular air raid lighting control will remain in effect. All shops, residences, and especially entertainment venues must strictly comply, ensuring that no light is leaked. The military and police, in conjunction with local self-defense corps, will organize lighting inspection teams to patrol all areas of the city. Those found to be violating lighting control measures by allowing light leaks will have their power lines cut and electricity supply terminated as punishment. Furthermore, a collective responsibility system will be enforced, with the entire bao and jia (neighborhood units) in the vicinity being subject to power cuts without leniency. Therefore, citizens are urged to pay close attention and strictly adhere to the regulations to avoid severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Police Station's Investigation Rooms to be Converted into Duty Rooms <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>To increase work efficiency, the Municipal Police Bureau has successively adjusted its internal organization. At the same time, the investigation rooms of each branch bureau have also been adjusted, in accordance with the police bureau's organization law promulgated by the central government, and converted into duty rooms to comply with the law. Orders have been issued to each branch bureau to implement this change from the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Finance, Industry and Commerce to Operate as Usual Today <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Following rumors in the city yesterday, merchants and civilians were mutually alarmed and illegally raised prices. To maintain social and economic order, the municipal authorities have decided to take responsibility for stopping these malicious behaviors to prevent unscrupulous citizens from disrupting the market. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank and all banks and money houses in the city will operate as usual today (the 13th), handling payment transactions for customers and continuing to accept deposit and loan requests. However, new loan applications will be temporarily suspended. The gold, securities, and Chinese stock markets will open and trade as usual today, and all companies and commercial firms will open for business.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Shanghai's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Experienced Violent Fluctuations Last Week <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In the past week, Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions experienced significant fluctuations due to the changes in the international situation, especially the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Speculators took advantage of this opportunity to engage in large-scale activities, causing violent changes in the market. The situation was particularly chaotic on Saturday. Fortunately, Mayor Zhou convened meetings with the heads of the gold and stock markets, instructing them to suppress drastic rises and falls. After the relevant financial authorities confirmed measures to maintain financial stability, the chaotic situation began to calm down somewhat.</p>
<p>Gold Certificates</p>
<p>On Monday, when the gold certificate market opened, prices declined due to low morale and widespread selling. The black market price for spot gold fell below the 9,000 yuan level, further discouraging interest in gold certificates. Prices rebounded slightly before closing, with the closing price at 9.8 million yuan, a slight decrease of 200,000 yuan from the closing price on the previous Saturday. The fifth-term gold certificate also decreased slightly by 90,000 yuan, closing at 8.1 million yuan. Due to the difficulty of achieving higher prices for spot gold, the market for gold certificates expiring on Tuesday was unable to open. The fifth-term certificate continued to decrease slightly by 60,000 yuan, closing at 7.5 million yuan. On Wednesday, gold certificates shook off their weak trend, and buying interest revived. Both expiring and fifth-term certificates increased by 300,000 to 350,000 yuan, and the black market price for spot gold exceeded 1,000 yuan, boosting morale. On Thursday, news of changes in the international situation emerged, and financiers rushed to buy expiring gold certificates, pushing the price above the 10 million yuan mark, closing at 11 million yuan, a rise of 850,000 yuan. The fifth-term certificate closed at 8.65 million yuan, a rise of 850,000 yuan. On Friday, morale remained high, and buyers continued to purchase, leading to further price increases. Due to the excessive rise in the black market price for spot gold, the market for expiring certificates was unable to open at a high price. The fifth-term certificate surged by 1.25 million yuan, closing with a squeeze of 1.25 million yuan. The highest price for spot gold was 14,500. On Saturday, the market situation became even more chaotic. Buyers raised prices to purchase, but no one was willing to sell, creating a situation with prices but no market. As a result, there were no official prices for spot gold and gold certificates. Silver bullion rose from 55,000 yuan to over 100,000 yuan, and silver dollars reached as high as seven yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market was also affected by the situation last week, with morale uncertain, experiencing initial stability, followed by a surge, and finally a return to level. The fluctuations were quite complex, and traders experienced uneven gains and losses. On Monday, the market hovered with stability. While medium-sized stocks saw increases, the three hottest stocks showed weakness and listlessness. However, as many as seventeen small-cap stocks rose to their limits. On Tuesday morning, all large, medium, and small stocks experienced a decline due to reports of tight credit. Bulls and retail investors competed to sell. In the afternoon, some stimulating news emerged, and credit conditions were reported to have eased, suddenly boosting morale. Continuous aggressive buying led to a recovery in all stocks, with more than twenty stocks rising to their limits. On Wednesday, the stock market continued to rise following the high prices of gold. There was a strong desire to buy, and the upward trend was unstoppable. A wave of buying at high prices was unprecedented, with ninety-one large, medium, and small stocks hitting their daily limits. On Thursday, the situation became even more turbulent, with another ninety-eight stocks hitting their daily limits. Some buyers were even willing to secretly add 30-50% to the limit price to purchase. Buyers were everywhere, as speculators took the opportunity of the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union to push up the stock market, making absorbing stocks the best strategy for preserving assets. On Friday, the municipal authorities, concerned about the chaotic stock market's impact on the financial system and social economy, instructed the securities exchange authorities to suppress drastic rises and falls in stocks. Any violation of the law would be severely punished, thus curbing the upward trend. On Saturday, due to changes in the international situation, brokers urged buyers and sellers to settle their transactions. Bulls aggressively sold, causing all stocks to plummet, but the market was much more stable than other markets, with moderate trading volume.</p>
<p>Commodity Prices</p>
<p>As for industry and commerce, at the beginning of last week, most gold and stock market speculators sold their gold and stocks, shifted their focus, and purchased essential food items. As a result, market prices rose accordingly. Rice, grains, oil, sugar, and flour all increased in price. The prices of goods sold by companies and commercial firms uniformly increased by 50% to 70%. Cotton textiles, wool fabrics, and daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles also increased accordingly. The upward trend became even more severe in the second half of the week, with the market seemingly in a state of extreme chaos. Although this situation was caused by special events, it is hoped that the municipal authorities and the industrial and commercial sectors will work together to maintain the overall livelihood and security of the people and stabilize the social economy in order to curb the crisis.</p>

<p>This office has contracted with Huisheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital to provide free maternity assistance. In July, each pregnant woman received food totaling 15,000 yuan. During this time of rising commodity and drug prices, the amount of 15,000 yuan is actually far from sufficient.

<h3 id="e31">An Appeal to the Elders of Various Temples in This City for a "Buddhist Nine-Family Team" <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Mika</p>
<p>I remember reading an article in the Shen Bao last December by Zhou Yuying, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, entitled "An Appeal to Monks and Taoists in This City to Devote Themselves to Social Welfare Enterprises." I felt ashamed for the elders of various temples in this city, that they do not even have a basis to establish, nor have they ever thought about establishing, this simplest and most realistic kind of welfare enterprise. About two months passed like this. Because of matters related to the City Buddhist Association, I first met with Director Zhou. At that time, due to Secretary-General Hu's introduction, we discussed the issue of Buddhist reform for a full hour. In conclusion, the Director said, "I am also a Buddhist believer. However, monks are relatively selfish, which is truly the misfortune of Buddhism." Although the Director gave me personal encouragement and expectations as we parted, my face was already red with shame.</p>
<p>Recently, this city has been bombed several times in succession. I have only heard that a certain temple is about to be dissolved, that a certain temple is afraid that Buddhist affairs will fade and problems will arise in their lives, and some have even sold their provisions to prepare for their own escape. In short, all are based on selfishness. They turn their thoughts and create worries within a small circle, without ever thinking about what we Buddhist monks should do in this time of war and turmoil. Those who usually mark themselves with "Promoting the Dharma is a family affair, benefiting sentient beings is a real enterprise" have also disappeared.</p>
<p>This time, the City Buddhist Association initiated a Buddhist Air Raid Rescue Team. After several meetings, the elders of the various temples seemed to be reluctantly going through the motions without fulfilling their own responsibilities, nor did they have the religious enthusiasm for humanity that they should possess. Moreover, they lacked unity. Every time when it comes to public welfare enterprises, they lack the spirit of Buddhists in terms of economic responsibility. Before the incident, although a few virtuous friends, such as Master Taixu, had vigorously appealed for "more service to society," their response was "apathy" or cold irony.</p>
<p>After the incident, a part of Shanghai, due to the complex and intertwined environment, achieved considerable prosperity. Many temples also experienced a relatively glorious golden age. At the same time, those Buddhist gold-diggers also moved to this "adventure playground." As a result, heaven does not fail those who are willing, and everyone "got what they wanted" and "everyone was happy." Precisely because of this relationship, the more selfish people are, the less interested they are in Buddhist public welfare. This kind of atmosphere is not only a Jewish way of doing things, it can simply affect the future development of Buddhism.</p>
<p>In the City Buddhist Association's letter of advice to believers to serve fellow citizens affected by air raids, it states: "Are the teachings of the Buddha and the good words usually spoken by Buddhists merely兑现的支票? Are Buddhists purely selfish, cold, and unsympathetic? Everything, everything, now gives us the greatest touchstone!" Mayor Zhou also reported at the Municipal Advisory Committee meeting that "Now fate has destined the citizens of Shanghai to experience this tragic life." Moreover, the devastation of Buddhism in the former Jiangbei area and the confiscation of all religions in Russia after the revolution may be reflections of our future Buddhism. Elders of the various temples, the times have progressed with the war. If we want to win the status of Buddhists in the future, then we must first win the faith of the people in Buddhism today. The only way to do this is to serve the people who are suffering from all kinds of hardships at this time and in this place with the Buddhist spirit of saving the world.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Key Points of Evacuation Work <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fengchi</p>
<p>Whether in terms of the dangers of air raids, the problem of food supply, or other problems, evacuating the population is an urgent task for Shanghai.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs, the municipal government has established the Shanghai Special Municipality Population Evacuation Committee to handle this matter. The committee gathers talents from all walks of life and shoulders the huge responsibility of evacuating one million people. Judging from the complexity of the procedures and the difficulty of the environment, it is indeed an arduous task. However, if it is approached with a spirit of collective effort, perseverance, and unwavering commitment, it is certain that it will proceed smoothly and achieve the ideal result. I will briefly present my humble opinion for your reference.</p>
<p>Preparatory work to be carried out in advance:　Publicity: Newspapers, publications, screens, and slogans should be carried out simultaneously to make citizens understand the urgency of evacuation and encourage those who can leave Shanghai to return to their hometowns.　Transportation: Planning for boats and vehicles, safety along the way, tidying up of stations and docks, and how to limit and utilize the return journey of boats and vehicles.　Destination: For the preparation of destinations, assuming that the towns, villages, counties and cities near the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and the triangular area of Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou are the destinations, we should first pay attention to the security and saturation point of the receiving capacity of each town and city, and establish contact with the military and political authorities and the various native place associations in each district.</p>
<p>Those to be evacuated, whether as a group or individually, can be divided into two categories:</p>
<p>Volunteers: A. Those who have a destination and the ability to go: provide various assistance, such as the purchase of tickets, the handling of ships, the relaxation of baggage limits, and the issuance of certificates to avoid the trouble of inspection. If there are remaining houses and furniture in Shanghai, a small number of people must be left to take care of them, and they should receive the same protection to prevent accidental losses. B. Those who have a destination but do not have the ability to go: in addition to the assistance in item A, provide economic assistance. C. Those who have the ability but no destination (such as Shanghai locals or those who have been in Shanghai for a long time and have lost contact with their hometown for a long time): can follow Mr. Kang Yuanjun's method of opening up Dongting Mountain as an evacuation area for Shanghai residents (please refer to the third issue of Shanghai Municipal Affairs). D. Those who have neither a destination nor the ability to go: in addition to providing various assistance, we must also consider their talents and abilities to find them a place to settle down, so as not to fall into the wrong path. This is the most difficult to handle and can be handled slowly. E. The relocation of factories, although more troublesome, has a great impact on the evacuation effect. The relocation of a factory with a large scope will inevitably involve several related small factories and a large number of workers. Therefore, if a factory wants to move, we should try our best to help it.</p>
<p>Compulsory: A. Charity groups, charity groups rely on donations from all walks of life to maintain themselves. If they can evacuate to a place far away from Shanghai, the cost will be saved due to the low price of rice and firewood. The area west of Taihu Lake is the most ideal area. It is said that the price of rice there is only 10,000 yuan per stone. Those who are worried about the security there, charity groups have nothing to do with this. B. Monks and Taoists can be evacuated to the mountains west of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, where there are many temples and monasteries, and the buildings are large. Moreover, the temple property is rich, and in addition to reciting sutras, they can also engage in planting and cultivate for themselves. This is the best way. C. Prisoners should be transferred to other places according to the length of their sentences. Detailed measures should be formulated by the judicial authorities. D. Evacuate people to a more distant place, find ways to settle them down and assign them work, so as not to disturb the local good people. E. Schools, including all schools above middle school, should be moved to a place closer to Shanghai. The area near the Beijing-Shanghai Line of Taihu Lake is the most suitable.</p>
<p>If those who come specifically requesting evacuation are not restricted, then those who leave will leave on their own, those who come will come on their own, or those who leave and return, or those who come but do not leave. In this way, not only will the effect not be achieved, but it will also be a waste of manpower and financial resources. Therefore, when the evacuation begins, restrictions on the population entering the city should be implemented at the same time. The so-called restrictions are by no means a complete cut off of the route to Shanghai. Those who are engaged in peddling and transporting goods, merchants who purchase goods, and even those who visit relatives and friends and those who are purely staying for a while, should also be allowed to enter the city. What is restricted is only the date of stay in Shanghai. Restriction measures:</p>
<p>Stop issuing residence permits to people from other cities entering Shanghai.　Restrict the long-term rental of hotels and apartments to outsiders. Set a reasonable deadline.　Restrict households from accommodating friends from other cities for a long-term stay. Set a reasonable deadline, and the Baojia is responsible for the investigation. Those who exceed the deadline will be urged to leave Shanghai.　Set up a travel permit issuing office at the entrance. For people entering the city holding a non-Shanghai residence permit, the residence permit will be exchanged for a travel permit, stipulating a time limit. It should be returned when leaving the city. We must strive for simple procedures and avoid disturbing the people.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Methods for Displaced Persons to Apply for Cash to Prevent Abuse <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Shizhou</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has officially begun a trial implementation of the "Cash Application for Returnees" program starting on the 6th of this month, with a limit of one million yuan per person. In addition, remittance services are also being offered, which will be of great benefit to the evacuation of the city's population. However, if we carefully examine the detailed rules promulgated by the Central Reserve Bank, we will find that there are still some important shortcomings in the Central Reserve Bank's methods that urgently need to be addressed. I will now discuss them one by one:</p>
<p>The original article states in item 1 that "Applicants for cash for returning to their hometowns should provide a guarantor." In fact, if the applicant is familiar with the guarantor, or if the applicant is a relative of the guarantor, it is very easy for the guarantor to collude with the applicant and commit fraud. Therefore, the guarantor cannot absolutely guarantee that the applicant will definitely return to their hometown or will definitely be able to return in the short term.</p>
<p>In addition, the applicant should also have a "Baojia Removal Certificate." The procedure is to first fill out a removal certificate at the Baojia office, and then have it signed and stamped in order by the Jia head, Bao head, joint Bao head, and police station, which can then be used as proof for applying for cash. However, after obtaining the above removal certificate, the applicant still has the right to reside in their original place, because the departure date is not fixed, or there are other matters that have not been completed. Therefore, if the Central Reserve Bank issues cash to the applicant solely on the basis of this removal certificate and guarantor letter, even if it is later discovered that the applicant has no intention of leaving Shanghai, the authorities cannot force the applicant to leave Shanghai immediately simply because they have received cash. In other words, if the applicant does not leave Shanghai immediately after receiving the cash, it does not constitute a crime of deceiving the authorities. How can the authorities distinguish between truth and falsehood? It is even more impossible to have a legal basis for accusing and punishing them for deception. In such a situation, if there are some lawless people who are greedy for profit and make use of the imperfections in the above-mentioned documents to apply for cash from the Central Reserve Bank, is the Central Reserve Bank prepared to treat this large group of applicants, both genuine and false, in the same way?</p>
<p>The original text of item 4 states: "Applicants can collect cash upon presentation of the receipt three days after depositing the bill, and their residence should be recorded at the time of deposit in order to investigate in advance and prevent abuse." The Central Reserve Bank believes that this essential procedure can prevent abuse, but may I ask, if the applicant does not leave Shanghai after obtaining the cash and completing all the proof procedures, what methods will the Central Reserve Bank use to deal with it?</p>
<p>In order to prevent abuses, I now offer the following supplementary method:</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank should immediately issue a notice, roughly stating: "Those who apply for cash for returning to their hometowns at this bank should leave Shanghai within ten days after receiving the cash, in order to comply with the original intention of this bank to assist in the evacuation work by vigorously handling 'Cash Applications for Returnees'." Each applicant should immediately prepare a report stating the date of departure from Shanghai within ten days after leaving Shanghai, and have it signed and stamped by their Bao head, Jia head, and neighbors' heads, and mail it to this bank by registered mail as proof. Baojia heads should also immediately report to this bank in writing when residents in their Bao move out of Shanghai. If the bank does not receive a report within ten days after the cash is paid that the applicant has left Shanghai within the prescribed time limit, the original amount should be recovered from the original guarantor, and they should be doubly punished. If the applicant is unable to leave Shanghai within ten days, they should also return the original amount to this bank in person within this prescribed time limit and reapply when the departure date is determined, in order to prevent abuses."</p>
<p>After implementing the above method, those who attempt to take advantage of loopholes will certainly not be willing to risk being humiliated by the Baojia heads for petty gains. The Central Reserve Bank can avoid unnecessary omissions. I hope that the Central Reserve Bank will give this method serious consideration and implement it.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Building New Parks <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Half of a citizen's health requires rich food and nutrition, and the other half requires clean, fresh air. However, in this noisy and bustling city of Shanghai, most citizens are suffocating day and night from inferior food and polluted air. They cannot come into contact with natural scenery. After being exhausted by the labor driven by life, finding a few convenient amusement parks (parks) is like looking for fish in a tree!</p>
<p>I believe that the nutrition of air is more important than the nutrition of food. Exposure to ultraviolet rays from sunlight can eliminate latent bacteria, and inhaling fresh air can protect the health of the lungs. If the ideal of realizing many "new parks" can be achieved, then every spring and autumn, whether it is the working class or the intellectual class, they can stroll through them day and night, cultivating their body and mind, and enjoying their spirit, forgetting the heavy pressure of being exploited by life, and enhancing the physical and mental health of the citizens, reducing the invasion of diseases. This really depends on having more and more parks.</p>
<p>Building new parks does not require a large area, but it needs to be an open area with grass and trees, so that people can have a place to place their spirits. The current Zhongshan Park (Zhao Feng Garden) is too far away, Gujiazhai Park has stopped being open for a long time, and the Bund Park is too small and crowded. It's too troublesome. It would be best to ask the municipal construction authorities to follow the example of the Aili Garden, and order many private gardens with foreign-style residences to turn private property into public property, assist them with the technical talents of horticulturalists, provide them with considerable financial subsidies, and send gardeners to arrange flowers and trees. All pavilions and buildings must meet the standards of municipal management, and police officers should be ordered to guard them twice in the morning and evening. I think that private garden owners will be happy to comply and turn private property into public property, benefiting the public health of citizens and benefiting the people. I hereby put forward a suggestion, hoping that the authorities will adopt it to improve the health of citizens, which is truly beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Further Discussion on Strengthening Air Defense Shelters <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Wulin</p>
<p>Air defense shelters, as the name suggests, are of course built to protect the lives of citizens during air raids. In principle, citizens should value air defense shelters as if they were their second life; but the fact is just the opposite. The following points should be eliminated and improved in the air defense shelters dug in the urban area:</p>
<p>Air defense shelters that were once "open-air toilets" and "public garbage bins" have now, unfortunately, become a good place for purchasers to arbitrarily discard melon peels, because many stalls selling watermelon and yellow essence melon have been newly added along the way. As a result, melon peels are scattered everywhere, attracting more lazy worms; and after accumulating for a long time, the stench evaporates, making people want to vomit.</p>
<p>The large amount of sand, mud, and stones dug out of the trenches are mostly scattered around the trenches by the diggers when they are completed, without being tidied up. As a result, a lot of it falls back into the trenches. Often when the wind comes, the sand and dust fly, covering the whole city, which is not only harmful to the cleanliness of the streets, but also helps to promote the spread of infectious diseases, which will inevitably get out of control once they occur, because the urban population is already crowded.</p>
<p>Although there are already many large and small air defense mounds dug in the urban area, unfortunately, most of them are unusable. They are either too shallow or too narrow, and do not conform to the standard size. Especially the personal air defense shelters, some are even only one foot deep, and it is impossible to even hide a child. In addition, it has been found that many of the walls of the personal air defense shelters have many large stone locusts embedded in them, which is extremely dangerous; if a bomb falls nearby, pedestrians will rush to escape, and will inevitably not have time to pay attention to the details in the trenches, and will jump into them, touching these stone locusts, which could cause minor injuries or serious death. The most unacceptable thing is that those large air defense shelters that have been perfectly covered have collapsed before they have been used even once. How can people not be afraid of their fragility! Regarding the strengthening of air defense shelters, I have a few personal opinions for reference and adoption.</p>
<p>Ban vendors selling watermelon, yellow essence melon, and other retail stalls along the way, or at least order them to be responsible for preventing purchasers from discarding melon peels in the air defense shelters. Violators should be arrested by patrolling police officers or self-defense team members or nearby residents and sent to the station for investigation.</p>
<p>The air defense authorities should cooperate with the Baojia police officers to thoroughly remove the dirt in the air defense shelters, and must always maintain their cleanliness. This work can be assigned to the self-defense team members on duty to be responsible for guarding them. Any accumulated water should be drained away, and any dirt should be removed. As far as possible, it is best to often sprinkle disinfectant such as Aoyao water to eliminate microorganisms. When the self-defense posts are replaced, they should first inspect the air defense shelters under their jurisdiction for a week. If there is no unclean place, then hand over the post to make clear the responsibilities. Because air raids may occur at any time, air defense shelters must be used at any time, and the cleanliness inside the shelters cannot be neglected for a moment.</p>
<p>For air defense shelters that are poorly handled or unusable, the passive approach is to simply fill them in, so as not to become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, and obstruct the road. The active approach is to order the diggers to immediately rebuild them, or deepen them, or widen them, or remove the stones, or pile up the sand, mud, and gravel scattered around the air defense shelters, and be sure to rebuild them into air defense shelters that can be "used" and can "defend against air raids."</p>
<p>Regarding the personal air defense shelters dug along the way and the unfinished large air defense shelters, it is often heard that pedestrians accidentally fall into them, which is quite a suffering. Some people advocate erecting a red light sign with "Beware of Danger" nearby for identification, but in fact, it is not necessary. The most appropriate way to deal with unfinished air defense shelters is of course to complete them as soon as possible, but do not be careless again, so as not to waste effort. As for personal air defense shelters, it is enough to paint a white circle around them to identify them; moreover, it saves on procedures and costs. Furthermore, all large and small air defense shelters are mostly dug along the side of the pedestrian road. If you are careful when walking, the possibility of accidentally falling is very small.</p>
<p>During each air defense drill, air defense shelter evacuation should also be included as a training item to become proficient in using air defense shelters for evacuation, and on the one hand, to promote citizens' love and cleanliness of air defense shelters.</p>
<p>The air defense authorities should send personnel to inspect air defense shelters in various places at any time, giving warnings to those who are negligent and correcting those who are bad, in order to achieve perfect results.</p>
<p>In the midst of strengthening the air defense system, please do not forget the most common and most important air defense shelters!</p>
<h3 id="e36">Promoting Economical Eating Methods <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Zhai</p>
<p>At this time of high food prices, we should carefully consider frugality in everything. Economical eating methods have also emerged in response to the times. The so-called economical eating method is to make economical considerations for people's three meals a day, so that not only is the cost lower, but also the nutrition should not be reduced, so as to fill the stomach. In my opinion, it can be divided into the following three types:</p>
<p>Implementing a One-Meal-Two-Congee System: Before the war, when rice prices were low, it can be said that most families ate rice for three meals a day. However, at present, it is really too uneconomical, so the one-meal-two-congee system has been widely adopted. The so-called one-meal-two-congee system is to change rice to congee for breakfast and dinner, while rice is still eaten for lunch. This way, not only is the amount of rice consumed less, but also the nutritional value is not lost. Because rice is starch, eating too much does not provide much nutrition. Instead, it fills the stomach and is difficult to digest, which is not in line with hygiene. This method is especially suitable for dinner, because people sleep soon after dinner, so changing rice to congee makes digestion easier. However, the disadvantage of this system is that it makes people hungry easily. To remedy this, it is best to shorten the time between meals, so that its drawbacks can be avoided.</p>
<p>Using Miscellaneous Grains as Much as Possible: Rice prices are certainly very expensive, but miscellaneous grains will never be more expensive than rice prices, because rice is regarded as the main food, while miscellaneous grains are relatively secondary. For example, various beans, wheat, and flour, corn and corn flour, their nutritional components are no less than rice, because they all contain rich vitamins. For example, eating red beans can remove dampness and prevent athlete's foot; eating green beans can cool down and prevent heatstroke; wheat and corn contain a lot of starch, and after being ground into powder, digestion and absorption are easy. Therefore, the effect of miscellaneous grains can be said to be worth noting. I hope everyone will implement the use of miscellaneous grains, so that the consumption of rice can be saved a lot.</p>
<p>Designating a Few Days Each Month to Eat Only Miscellaneous Grains: The function of miscellaneous grains is as described above, and the taste is also very good. We designate a few days in a month, or designate any month in each week as a miscellaneous grain day, so that rice is definitely not needed. For example, eat red bean soup this Sunday, green bean soup next Sunday, and then eat noodles, corn flour pancakes, etc. By analogy, this way, on the one hand, we can change the taste, and on the other hand, we can break the traditional habit of relying on rice for food, which can be said to be a double gain.</p>
<p>I have personally experienced the above three methods. The first method has been practiced for a long time and has become a habit. It does not feel inconvenient, but instead promotes digestion. For the second method, my family implements oatmeal or corn flour for breakfast, and red beans or cowpeas for lunch. For dinner, we usually cook the leftover rice from lunch into rice porridge. Since then, the body is indeed healthier than before, which can be known from the light footsteps when walking. As for the third method, there are many ways to eat. In addition to the above, there is also eating potatoes (foreign taro) recently. The method is to cook potatoes with lard and shallots, which is both fragrant and easy to digest. It is indeed a food with a special flavor, so everyone may want to try it.</p>
