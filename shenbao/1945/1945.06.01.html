<h3>沖繩島大雨泥濘　全線展開激戰中　日陸海空軍一體續施攻擊</h3>
<p>琉球羣島三十一日中央社電　敵於冲繩本島南部地區之攻擊目標，逐次針對首里南方之日軍陣地，十五日以來敵之砲擊與艦砲射擊益形劇烈，砲彈多集中於與那原·首里以南，大城·伊　以北之地區，特別為首里南方四公里之照屋，津嘉地區。二十八日地上戰鬥之焦點，在來部地區爲大里·宮城，在中部苜里前面爲石嶺·大名，在西部地區爲那　之東南方，日軍守備隊在砲兵掩護下，隨時衝人敵陣，於火雨泥濘中，全綫展開激戰。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地三十一日中央社電日陸·海·空軍，自二十八日對冲繩本島附近敵艦船開始總攻後，繼於三十日冒惡劣天氣，再度展開攻擊。是日上午炸沉敵艦型不詳者兩艘，擊毀一艘，重創一艘，又薄暮實行特攻，衝入敵艦船羣，命中敵空母或巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，艦型不詳者四艘。日軍又對本島，伊江島·慶良問列島之機塲實行夜襲，予敵以極大損害，因此，三十日下午竟無敵機來襲冲繩本島，而來襲列島一帶者，亦僅八十架左右。</p>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　冲繩本島日美兩軍，仍由東海岸之中城聲，與那原附近，經首里北方至那覇郊外之綫對峙中·戰綫呈現膠着狀態。但戰鬥依然日形劇烈，雙方在東西十餘公里之戰綫　短兵接戰，無時稍息，敵於二十一日開始第四次攻勢以來，茉經旬餘，敵如前進一尺，則日軍亦奪取一寸，展開拉鋸式之激戰，　觀冲繩本島之陸上戰鬥，此數日來雙方已由單綫而變成複綫作戰。二十一日敵開始第三次攻勢時，以那　首里之正面兩海岸爲攻擊重點，但遭日方猛烈之大反攻，僅於數日之戰鬥中，第一錢之二師，殆呈潰滅之勢，死傷達二萬，其攻勢已遭挫折，故第四次攻勢即避免日軍正面陣地，置其攻擊主要目標於東海岸。於攻人與那原後，更威脅以那覇·首里爲中心之日軍陣地側背，使日方複廊陣地陷於孤立，近數日來，敵之作戰更形復雜化，仍自東海岸方面實施主攻擊。又自那覇首里之中問地帶及其他數處地點，企圖突破日軍陣綫，刻冲繩本島登陸之敵兵力，有陸軍四師，海兵四師，計共八師，敵似有以其半數循環配置第一綫之勢，然數日來遂加入預備師，於前綫舉其登陸全勢力，反覆加以猛攻。因此，日軍之戰綫，亦由單綫逐漸形成凸凹魷綜之複錢。二十四日，日義烈空挺部隊曾於敵機基地之北。中兩機塲降下，抑制敵基地空軍之活動，繼之特攻隊刻正傾全力對本島四周海上之敵艦船羣攻擊，亦逐漸熾烈，予以重創，然日特攻隊之猛力，尚未能遮斷敵軍之補給路綫，美軍陸上部隊，仍由有力補給支持中。</p>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　大宮島來電，美太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資二十九日發表，美海軍於冲繩海而所受之損害，自五月二十七日晚至二十八日，美軍艦一艘被日機擊沉，此外太平洋艦隊艦艇十二艘遭受損害。</p>
<h3>日機對泰拉干　施夜間轟炸</h3>
<p>南方前機三十一日中央社電　日航空部隊於二十七，八·九三日問，對泰拉干敵陣地連續施行夜問轟炸，於明月之夜，接近敵陣，同時攻擊轟炸敵飛機塲，貨物集積所，登陸施設等，敵陷於混亂狀態，並未見敵機出擊。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地三十一日中央社電　泰拉干島日美兩軍，現仍於近距離地點互相對峙，各無進展，戰鬥無大變化。二十八日極爲平靜，二十九日晨，美軍復以轟炸機，艦砲及其他火器，熾烈攻擊。日軍亦以肉搏隊數隊深入敵陣，殺傷敵兵一百三十餘名，截獲自動步槍七挺，作毀幕舍三處，輕　槍一架。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地三十一日中央社電　敵軍於十六日晨，對泰拉干機塲東北方日軍第一綫陣地加强壓力，日軍亦行勇敢反擊，使敵受莫大損失，其後顧及作戰效果，乃整理一部陣地。阿慕爾方面之日軍，對來襲之敵軍主力部隊，施行猛襲，予以重創，十二·十三兩日·敵軍被日軍衝鋒殲滅一中隊，且鹵獲兵器彈藥多數，更進而遮斷敵軍後繼部隊進路，將其擊潰，並使自軍佔作戰主動地位。</p>
<h3>軍委會改組</h3>

<h3>存煤日內運滬　分配各工廠</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　實業部為疏通煤觔來源，復興上海工業起見，已飭該部附設之煤礦增產督導委員會，趕將各地煤礦所產煤觔源源運滬，以供應用。茲聞該會已將自備航輪兩艘，各帶拖駁所有仔煤起　，日內常有大量煤觔運滬，分配上海各工廠應用。</p>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　煤礦增產督導委員會所購運煤航輸兩艘及拖駁若干艘，日前自滬抵京，隨船載來一部礦山應用資材，並於日昨啓椗開赴錢頭山，預料日內常有大批煤斤來京，以應各方需要。</p>
<h3>伊朗致牒三國　要求撤駐軍</h3>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　德黑闌來電，伊朗外長波德，三十日於國會席上宜稱，伊朗外交部已對駐德黑關三國（英·美·蘇）大使館正式通牒，因歐洲戰鬥行為已完全停止，伊朗政府為確立國內正常體制計，要求三國軍隊自伊朗國丙退去，以便整頓一切國政。</p>

<h3>日航空機工場　生產率增加</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日政府爲岡於空襲時顯著維特航空機之生產培養起見，基於三月二日閣議决定之特定航空機工塲緊念措置要綱，於四月一日將一部工塲移歸國營，以軍需省所屬之軍需工塲爲出發點，其後之生產率已顯著增加。四月份較三月份增加百分之囗囗，迨五月份更顯示較四月份增加，其原因如次：　幹部以次全部工員及學生，均認淸國營觀念，勞動熱忱已顯著昂楊。　關於軍需工塲運各營種對外交涉圓消化等。按軍需工塲之設立，於此大規模之敵機空製下，工塲之防護，疏開分散及設立地下工塲，輸送勞務資材之確保等，如以原來民間之責任者經營之，適應戰局，不無遺憾，故決於官民一體之新機構下，確保航空機之生產工作。</p>
<h3>台維斯　赴英使命</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　每日新聞社瑞典京城特派員　本氏，就特魯曼特派台維斯赴英之使命報道如次：　合維斯第一使命，乃在說服邱吉爾，使邱吉爾於歐洲不採取與蘇聯角逐政策。蓋美國已充分認識蘇聯於歐洲大陸之態度及其勢力之滲透情形，且知業已不能使之變更，故乃要求英國亦須認識此種事實，與美採取相同措置。　當台維斯訪問倫敦特，霍浦金赴莫斯科，採取與台維斯相同之活動方針，說服史太林，使蘇聯之要求在可能限度內予以寬容，俾使英國易於接受。　台維斯更對邱吉爾說明，美國已熟知英國極關心蘇聯在歐洲之活動情形，然美國於東亞之利害得失尤為重要，故美國決不能放棄本身利害，捲入歐洲紛亂。</p>
<h3>華維爾　即將反印　印堅要求獨立</h3>

<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　英勞工黨領袖阿特里，當選舉戰行將展開之際，曾聲明立即予印度以自治領地位，然據舊金山來電稱，尼赫魯之妹班迭特女史，二十八日曾聲明印度並非自治領，要求獨立。班迭特稱，英勞工黨將來如果選舉獲勝，除僅予印度以自治領地位外，毫無重要意義，歐洲之法西斯體制雖已崩潰，然酷似法西斯體制之英國帝國主義仍繼續存在，吾人不解何故不予印度以天賦之獨立。印度之領袖被逮據後，並不予以裁判，此又何故，蘇聯對印度獨立全面協力，使我印度民衆感激不盡。</p>
<h3>西勞工黨主張　推翻費朗哥</h3>
<p>里期本三十一日中央社電　此間接獲舊金山報告稱，西班牙勞工黨代表普里埃多，昨在舊金山舉行西班牙「解於委員會」會議時，向記者團發表推翻弗朗哥政權之安全方法。　世界安全會議，須正式宣告否認弗朗哥政體，同時聲明弗朗哥將軍之西班牙將不得加入新國際組織。　民主各國須與弗期哥政體斷絕外交關係。　召集國會，重新組織一立憲政府。　世界民主各國，須正式承認此臨時新政府。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>米價狂漲與農貨工作</h3>
<p>最近一旬中米價之高漲達於瘋狂狀態。於）句以前，每石米價尚盤旋於十關左右，而其後逐日上昇，至今已突破三十關以上，於是其他物價亦隨之掀起漲潮。關於這次物價的波動，五月二十八日本報社評會指出兩大特徴：　係由四鄉及小都巿米價之狂躍爲領導；　是開始於米糧靑黃不接之期。因之共結果有兩個危機：　漲風幾遍及於全和平區；　並非週期性而帶有持續性；從而其對於民生以至社會秩序的威脅亦更嚴重！</p>
<p>考此次以米糧爲中心的物價漲風，其形成之因素甚多，而最根本者則爲米糧之不足。因米糧不足，故屆靑黃不接之際，更引起了社會人心之恐慌，而促成了米價——跟着是一般物價——之直綫上漲。故救治之道，端在增產，使米糧之供給足應需要，即可除去刺激漲價之因　，解決民生問題之大半。</p>
<p>近年本市之民食，因遠地運輸不使，　須求能就近取給，故尤期望於蘇省產米區之增產，是以對於蘇省農的經濟上之困難，有予以充份協助使之解除的必要。本市諮詢委員會本此意義，特組成農貸銀團，負責募集五十萬萬元貸放蘇省產米區農民，茲已商定於六月初旬籌足款項，委請蘇省府全機辦理貸放，將來新殺登塲時，即以米糧遝滬，以償本息（見五月二十三日本報）。對於此舉，本報四月十六日及二十八日社評已予論列，說明其意義是在：　解除農民受高利貸的痛苦，供給其生產資本，以挽救農村經濟，促進增產效果；　誘導都市游資流人農村，以戰投機暴利之風，而減刺戰物價之力。至其方法則爲：　募集時，請有錢者爲救人救己，盡量投資（不是捐輸），　貸放時，以低利直接貸予農民爲主，以免除中問人之剝削；　貸款不限貨幣，亦可以耕具糧籽爲代；　償還時以米殺運滬，以調劑上海的民食。此事若辦理完善，則農民稍可疏息，而上海民生問題的解決，亦可得一助力，實是一舉而兩得。聞此次農貸集款，中儲行協力殊多。</p>
<p>惟時至今日，農耕之期已屆，全部貸未亟須募齊。尚望各業有力者羣起自動投資，在此高物價下，實是愈速態妙，否則倘若民食問題常此嚴重，恐將引起飢民騷動，社會秩序，紊亂可慮。</p>
<p>最後，還有幾點希望：　執行農貸之募集，貸放與淸償之負責者，務須大公無私，任勞任怨，精細迅速；　請有關當局配合着此項農貸工作，全力整飭農村秩序，肅淸一切盜匪敲詐烟賭等情事；並儘速散發優良之品種與適當之工具，而且發動農藝人才至四鄉指導增產技術；以使增產工作，能順利進行，而收最大效果。　當此米價暴漲期間，應請在政常局趕速設法調劑各地米糧，以殺其漲勢；同時更希望民衆盡量節約米榖，多用雜糧，而雜糧乘機結價，尤須嚴防。</p>
<p>對於米糧問題，徒抱恐慌心理，實屬有害無益。我人所當注重的，是怎樣去切切實實地實行解決的辦法，才是根本之道！</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>農貸的道議性</h3>
<p>關於上海市政諮詢委員會計劃動員上海的民間資本貸予江蘇產米地區一事，已屢有記載，我們亦嘗指出其重要性。今幸上海方面的準備工作差已完成，不久即可貸與農民。此不僅在產米地區的農民將額手稱慶，凡關心於中國農利農民的人，亦莫不覺得欣慰。</p>
<p>五十億元農貸的最大意義，是在於上海有力人士正確理解上海與地方的不可分離性，深知爲解決上海的糧食問題，實有與產米地區協力農業增產的必要，且此舉已見諸實踐。李思浩氏致江蘇任省長函中·特別闡明此點，並言及上海民食問題的解決須待江蘇產米地區的增產，因而更有解除農民苦痛的必要。此語鹹然。再則，上海知辦界與金融界能顧念及此，而表示分担江蘇農民苦痛的態度，實較農貸實施後所獲的經濟效果更可珍貴。</p>
<p>農業貸款的經濟意義，已屢經論及，旣可開闢都市遊資出路，又可防止通貨膨脹的惡化，同時以生產資金供給農民，足以增加農產農民的福社。由此觀之，此舉確爲一舉兩得之事。雖五十億農貸對於上海經濟的影響尚難言量大，但此項資金在農村將發生如何重大的作用，則頗堪注目。預料江蘇省政府當能盡其責任，確實以低利分配農貸資金認農民之手，且於農貸資金調度上所表現的崇高的政治道義性，必再表現於其貸放的過程上。所以農民將有無限的福祉，常無疑義。</p>
<p>關於農貸條件，上海方面幾無任何條件，而付託江蘇省當局以全權辦理的態度，與江蘇省方面亦表明願意積極協力解決上海民食間題的旨趣，都是値得大書特書的。此次離開了算盤而實施農貸這一點，足以表現兩方成當事者的道義性。此種崇高的道義觀念，無論在農業貸款的貸放過程上，或在其歸還的時候，必可始終一貫。</p>
<p>當此農費實施時，我們所希望的，第一是活用現在最能把握農足的合作社，第二是現在爲一般人所注目的無錫·常熟方面，應作爲農貸的重點區域而積極貸放。江蘇省政府對於當地情形當然很熟悉，不待我們希望，上述二點亦當能見諸實現；惟從農貸的性質而言，這兩點也是應該希望的。農業貸款，在其本質上，是聯擊上海與江蘇產米地區的堅强的紐帶，而且很有道義的性質。此爲農貸見諸實踐時，我們所特別感到的。（五月三十日大陸新報）</p>

<p>關於最近冲繩島戰况，由於雨季影響，日美兩軍雖作戰激烈，惟雙方均感進展困難。本市軍事評論家，就冲繩島最近情况，作詳切之窺測。</p>
<p>雨季降臨阻礙陸戰</p>
<p>上戰鬥方面：刻正在那霸首里之郊外，雙方繼續激烈砲戰，敵英美軍死傷頻增，敵戰爭指導者亦承認今後之出血，益趨龐大。惟最近該方面之雨勢，運續不斷，日美兩軍對此雨季時期，均深感進展困難。在五月下旬僅入日中，所降雨量超過六英吋以上，預料在六月初後，雨勢將更猛烈，故深信此後三星期中，日美兩軍之作戰，決無甚大進展。據美合衆社特派員於廿九日在冲島發出電文稱，那霸之泥濘，可謂空前所未有，除步行之外，毫無其他方法。該特派員亦自稱曾步行數公哩，目見途上被日軍破壞之美戰車有十數輛，刻美軍向首里郊外行軍，不論軍醫及臼砲陣地之增兵，均須行走，雖有歸返之運輸車輛，則滿戰戰死之士兵。</p>
<p>敵艦損失十艘以上</p>
<p>在海上方百，日軍特攻隊。賡續冒惡劣氣候，猛擊敵人。據敵方所發表自二十八·九日以來，日軍對其艦艇之攻擊，至為猛烈，創敵艦船已有十數艘以上，刻敵軍對日本特攻隊有出乎意料之　懼，各方均對日特攻隊，作可長情形之報告。據最近舊金山廣播所稱：冲繩島與過去之硫黃島，在美本國之距離，頗爲遙遠，冲島距離日本土爲三百七十五海聖，而距珍珠灣爲四千六百海哩，故美軍在此相反之比例下作戰，殊感負擔太重。故美艦隊欲於此不利之狀態下，將日艦隊殲滅，誠爲難事。尤堪注意者，即爲日本航空機反復攻擊，破壞美艦船，美國在船舶補充上，亦最爲困難，單就二十四·三十五兩日，在冲島海面艦船之損失數目，已可一目瞭然。美軍曾對日機之來襲，駕機翱翔上空自衛，及有艦砲之抵抗，但仍喪失艦船十餘艘，故聯合國之艦艇頗難保障。如今美國在冲島所遭受之損害，如不能做到向該方面增強兵力，則將來英美軍在太平洋戰錢上，決難獲取理想之前方有力基地。</p>
<p>特攻隊員以一殺百</p>
<p>日本特攻隊之戰果，靑年隊員四百四十人之壯烈殉國，給與敵方之損害如下：計擊沉正規空母三艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦三艘，艦型不詳者一艘，遝輸艦十八艘，合計二十九艘。擊破正規空母七艘，制式空母一艘，戰艦六艘，巡洋艦九艘，驅逐艦一艘，魚艇一艘，　型不詳者一艘，運輸艦十八艘，合計五十四艘。而敵方之人員損書，在擊沉方面計有五成、擊毀方面三成，今以敵方最低此例計算美海軍至少有三萬三千零七十五人之損失，尚有未曾確認特攻隊之戰果頗多，並不包括在內。今對此明文之發表，日本特攻隊之四百四十人之殉國，擊滅敵海軍三萬餘人，每人平均擊敵七十五人，無異以一殺百，日本國內有數百萬之雄壯靑年，均具果敢殺敵精神，確可自信獲取最後之勝利。</p>
<p>呂宋各島仍在激戰</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面戰况：　呂宋島之戰鬥，刻在聖太菲及加牙因一帶激戰中。　民大諾島在內地馬來貝來，仍有激烈之作戰。　緬甸方面，在仰光東南卅二公里之瓦城公路披亞之區，有伊洛瓦底江之孟登東南，均有激戰。泰拉干之日守衛軍，刻仍誘敵登陸戰擊中。上述之西南太平洋作戰情形，日軍由於補給上之不便，暫時不採取積極之作戰，但在各戰塲上，均以巧妙方法誘敵　大兵力，期使敵大量出血。</p>
<p>登陸作戰準備萬全</p>
<p>據五月二十八日華盛頓電：美海軍部於是日發表稱：過去美海軍中具有强大海上戰術及航空兵力之美護送空母戰隊之混成第八十八部隊，曾三次出動大規模之海陸作戰，此次在太平洋歷經八個月之戰鬥，任務已經終了，刻返國休息云云。惟對該部隊之行動，及今後作戰之企圖，猶難逆料。但據二十八日倫敦電稱：日本軍之統帥部，刻已根據現實觀點，準備應對英美軍主力之新的行動。日軍並已準備新的配備，對付今後英美在中國沿海各岸，或日本本土登陸之蠢動。此外尚有駐渝特派員葛萊姆，亦對大陸作戰有所批評，字裏行間頗嘵有意味。惟在今後之戰局上，在我人亦値得有所警惕。</p>
<p>美國生產轉向民需</p>
<p>又三十日舊金山廣播稱：美已緊縮軍需生產，美戰時生產局長克勞格佔計價格，已縮減爲七十億美圓，但如大量要求物資時仍須予以補充，同時在人員資材及工業生產力，均具有相當力量，以增强民需生產，如今美國內和平氣氛之環境，係促成生產轉移民需方面之原因。並據二十八日美國陸軍航空本部之發表，資本金一百萬元之費勞萊工廠，自六月十五日起，將四發動機之之B24型機之生產，予以停止。</p>
<p>歐陸近東國際糾紛</p>
<p>最近國際間之情勢變遷，如法國之突轉左傾，與西班牙右派執政之弗朗哥政權，大相逕庭，故今後法西兩國之關係，殊堪注視。再義大利黨派鬥爭益形顯著。目光再向東移，又見叙利亞黎巴嫩兩國由於英法兩國之關係，復發生錯綜複雜之情勢。當首次世界大戰結束後，國際間糾紛，屢見不鮮。最近報載之叙利亞黎巴嫩事件，更趨緊張。英外相艾登於五月二十九日在下院發表叙黎事變之發表，指稱妨礙對日戰爭之進展，不能允許其行動之擴大展開，並向各方耍求鄭重之忍耐。謂法軍在叙利亞，增加兵力，僅五百名，英政府決積極向法政府商　中。蓋中東之衝突將影響至東亞之交通綫，艾登首相並於翌日發表英正與法進行協議，以解決叙黎事件。是日叙代理首相　密爾曾與英美兩國公使協議，在內閣舉行特別會議。方今歐戰甫吿段落之時，複雜糾紛已屬出不窮，縱使此次二次大戰終了之，難保不掀起第三次大戰</p>

<h3>Okinawa Island Heavy Rain and Mud, Fierce Battle Underway on All Fronts, Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Continue to Attack as One</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands, May 31st, Central News Agency - The enemy's attack targets in the southern part of Okinawa Island are gradually directed towards the Japanese army's positions south of Shuri. Since the 15th, enemy artillery and naval gun fire have become increasingly intense, with shells mostly concentrated in the areas south of Yonabaru and Shuri, and north of Ōshiro and Ita. The focus of ground combat on the 28th was in the Komesu area for Ōzato and Miyagi, in front of Shuri in the central area for Ishimine and Ōna, and southeast of Naha in the western area. Japanese garrison troops, under the cover of artillery, repeatedly charged into enemy positions, engaging in fierce battles along the entire front line amidst a rain of fire and mud.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, May 31st, Central News Agency - The Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force, after launching a general offensive against enemy ships near Okinawa Island on the 28th, resumed attacks on the 30th despite adverse weather conditions. On the morning of the same day, two enemy ships of unidentified type were sunk, one was destroyed, and one was heavily damaged. In the evening, a special attack was carried out, plunging into the enemy fleet, hitting one enemy aircraft carrier or cruiser, one destroyer, and four ships of unidentified type. The Japanese forces also launched night raids on airfields on the main island, Ie Island, and the Kerama Islands, inflicting great damage on the enemy. As a result, no enemy planes attacked Okinawa Island on the afternoon of the 30th, and only about 80 planes attacked the island chain area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency - On Okinawa Island, the Japanese and American forces remain in a stalemate along the line from Nakagusuku Bay and the vicinity of Yonabaru on the east coast, through the north of Shuri, to the outskirts of Naha. The battle line is in a state of deadlock. However, the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce, with both sides engaging in close combat along a front line of over ten kilometers east to west, without a moment's respite. Since the enemy launched its fourth offensive on the 21st, more than ten days have passed. If the enemy advances one foot, the Japanese army will seize one inch, engaging in a back-and-forth fierce battle. Observing the land battle on Okinawa Island, the combat has evolved from a single line to a multiple line operation in the past few days. When the enemy launched its third offensive on the 21st, it focused its attack on the two coasts facing Naha and Shuri, but it was met with a fierce counterattack by the Japanese side. In just a few days of fighting, the two divisions of the first line were almost annihilated, with casualties reaching 20,000, and their offensive was thwarted. Therefore, the fourth offensive avoided the Japanese army's frontal positions and placed its main attack target on the east coast. After attacking Yonabaru, it further threatened the flanks of the Japanese army's positions centered on Naha and Shuri, isolating the Japanese army's complex defense lines. In recent days, the enemy's operations have become more complex, still implementing the main attack from the east coast. They are also attempting to break through the Japanese army's lines from the central zone between Naha and Shuri and several other locations. The enemy's troop strength landed on Okinawa Island is currently four army divisions and four marine divisions, totaling eight divisions. It seems that the enemy is rotating half of its forces on the front line, but in recent days, they have added reserve divisions, launching repeated attacks with their entire landed force on the front line. Therefore, the Japanese army's battle line has also gradually formed a complex line with uneven and intertwined protrusions. On the 24th, the Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit landed at the enemy's northern and central airfields, suppressing the activities of the enemy's base air force. Subsequently, the special attack force is now exerting all its strength to attack the enemy fleet around the island, which is also gradually becoming fierce, inflicting heavy damage. However, the fierce force of the Japanese special attack force has not yet been able to cut off the enemy's supply lines, and the American ground forces are still supported by a strong supply line.</p>

<h3>Iran Sends Diplomatic Note to Three Countries, Demanding Withdrawal of Troops</h3>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency - A dispatch from Tehran reports that Iranian Foreign Minister Bode declared in Parliament on the 30th that the Iranian Foreign Ministry has officially sent a diplomatic note to the embassies of the three countries stationed in Tehran (Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union). Because the European combat operations have completely ceased, the Iranian government, in order to establish a normal system in the country, requests that the troops of the three countries withdraw from Iranian territory in order to reorganize all national affairs.</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Recognize Austrian Provisional Government</h3>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Factory Production Rate Increases</h3>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency - In order to significantly maintain and cultivate the production of aircraft during air raids, based on the Outline of Emergency Measures for Specific Aircraft Factories decided by the cabinet meeting on March 2nd, the Japanese government transferred a part of the factories to state-owned operation on April 1st, using the military factories under the Ministry of Munitions as a starting point. The subsequent production rate has increased significantly. The production in April increased by [redacted] percent compared to March, and the production in May showed an even greater increase compared to April. The reasons are as follows: 1. All workers and students, from the cadres down, have clearly recognized the concept of state-owned operation, and their enthusiasm for labor has been significantly increased. 2. The coordination of various operations and external negotiations in the military factory is smoother, etc. The establishment of military factories is based on the fact that, under the large-scale enemy air raids, the protection, evacuation, and dispersion of factories, the establishment of underground factories, and the securing of transportation of labor and materials, if operated by the original private sector, may not be able to adapt to the war situation. Therefore, it was decided to ensure the production of aircraft under a new official-private integrated mechanism.</p>
<h3>Davies's Mission to England</h3>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency - The Stockholm correspondent of the Mainichi Shimbun, Mr. Hongs, reported on Truman's special envoy Davies's mission to England as follows: Davies's first mission is to persuade Churchill not to adopt a policy of competing with the Soviet Union in Europe. The United States has fully recognized the Soviet Union's attitude and penetration in the European continent, and knows that it is no longer possible to change it. Therefore, it requires Britain to also recognize this fact and take the same measures as the United States. When Davies visits London, Hopkins will go to Moscow and take the same course of action as Davies, persuading Stalin to be tolerant of Soviet demands within possible limits so that Britain can easily accept them. Davies further explained to Churchill that the United States is well aware that Britain is extremely concerned about the Soviet Union's activities in Europe, but the United States' own interests in East Asia are even more important. Therefore, the United States cannot abandon its own interests and get involved in European conflicts.</p>
<h3>Wavell to Return to India Soon, India Firmly Demands Independence</h3>
<p>Stockholm, May 31st, Central News Agency - A report from London states that the British Secretary of State for India, Amery, stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, will return to India at the weekend.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency - The leader of the British Labour Party, Attlee, declared when the election campaign was about to begin that he would immediately grant India dominion status. However, according to a dispatch from San Francisco, Nehru's sister, Miss Pandit, stated on the 28th that India is not a dominion and demands independence. Pandit said that if the British Labour Party wins the election in the future, it will be of no great significance other than granting India dominion status. Although the fascist system in Europe has collapsed, British imperialism, which is very similar to the fascist system, continues to exist. We do not understand why India is not given its natural independence. Why are India's leaders arrested and not tried? The Soviet Union's full cooperation for India's independence has made the Indian people infinitely grateful.</p>
<h3>Spanish Labor Party Advocates Overthrowing Franco</h3>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency - A report received here from San Francisco states that the representative of the Spanish Labour Party, Prieto, announced to reporters at the meeting of the Spanish "Liberation Committee" held in San Francisco yesterday the safe methods to overthrow the Franco regime. The World Security Conference must formally declare its denial of the Franco regime and state that General Franco's Spain will not be allowed to join the new international organization. Democratic countries around the world must sever diplomatic relations with the Franco regime. Convene the parliament to reorganize a constitutional government. The world's democratic countries must formally recognize this temporary new government.</p>

<p>Stockholm, May 31st, Central News Agency - A dispatch from London states that regarding the precarious situation in Syria and Lebanon, British Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Member of Parliament Lybias in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 30th: "The French government has disregarded the British government's warnings and strongly presented an additional deployment of troops. In order to make the French government respect the British government's desire to guarantee its independence, it has decided to take appropriate measures. The situation in the Syrian region is gradually changing, and recently, disturbances have occurred in Beirut and other places. The British government is currently in contact with the American government, but Britain's policy has been repeatedly stated and will not retreat a step on this matter."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Crazy Rise in Rice Prices and Agricultural Loan Work</h3>
<p>In the most recent ten days, the surge in rice prices has reached a frantic state. Before [redacted], the price of rice per dan (unit of dry measure) was still hovering around ten yuan, but since then it has risen daily, and has now broken through thirty yuan or more. As a result, the prices of other commodities have also risen in a tidal wave. Regarding this price fluctuation, the editorial board of this newspaper pointed out two major characteristics on May 28th: 1. It is led by the crazy jump in rice prices in the countryside and small cities; 2. It began during the season when rice and grain are running out. As a result, there are two crises: 1. The inflationary wave has spread almost throughout the entire peaceful area; 2. It is not cyclical, but has a sustained nature; Therefore, its threat to people's livelihood and even social order is even more serious!</p>
<p>Considering the formation factors of this price surge centered on rice, there are many factors, and the most fundamental one is the shortage of rice. Because of the shortage of rice, the approach of the lean season has further aroused social panic, and promoted a straight-line rise in rice prices - followed by a general rise in prices. Therefore, the way to save is to increase production, so that the supply of rice can fully meet the needs, so as to remove the cause of stimulating price increases and solve most of the problem of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>In recent years, the food of the city has to be obtained nearby because long-distance transportation is not convenient, so it is especially expected that rice-producing areas in Jiangsu Province will increase production. Therefore, it is necessary to provide full assistance to the economic difficulties of farmers in Jiangsu Province so as to alleviate them. Based on this significance, the Municipal Advisory Committee specially formed an agricultural loan syndicate to be responsible for raising 500 million yuan to lend to farmers in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. It has now been agreed that the funds will be raised by early June, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be entrusted with the full authority to handle the lending. In the future, when the new harvest is available, rice will be shipped to Shanghai to repay the principal and interest (see this newspaper on May 23). Regarding this move, this newspaper's editorials on April 16th and 28th have discussed and explained that its significance lies in: 1. Alleviating the suffering of farmers from high-interest loans, supplying them with production capital, so as to save the rural economy and promote increased production; 2. Guiding urban idle funds to flow into rural areas, so as to combat the wind of speculation and profiteering, and reduce the force of price increases. As for its methods: 1. When raising funds, please ask the rich to invest (not donate) as much as possible to save people and themselves; 2. When lending, the main goal is to lend directly to farmers at low interest rates, so as to eliminate the exploitation of intermediaries; 3. Loans are not limited to currency, but can also be replaced by farming tools and grain seeds; 4. When repaying, rice will be shipped to Shanghai to regulate the city's food supply. If this matter is handled properly, farmers can be relieved a little, and a solution to Shanghai's livelihood problem can also be obtained, which is truly a win-win situation. It is reported that the Central Trust of China has provided a great deal of assistance in this fundraising for agricultural loans.</p>
<p>However, as of today, the farming season has arrived, and all loans need to be raised quickly. It is still hoped that all powerful people will take the initiative to invest together. Under this high price situation, the faster the better, otherwise, if the food problem is always so serious, it may cause famine riots, and social order may be disturbed.</p>
<p>Finally, here are a few more hopes: 1. Those responsible for implementing the fundraising, lending, and repayment of agricultural loans must be selfless, hardworking, and meticulous; 2. Please ask the relevant authorities to cooperate with this agricultural loan work, and make every effort to rectify rural order, and eliminate all theft, extortion, gambling and other things; and distribute excellent varieties and appropriate tools as soon as possible, and mobilize agricultural talents to go to the countryside to guide increased production technology; so as to make the increased production work proceed smoothly and achieve the greatest effect. 3. During this period of soaring rice prices, the authorities should be asked to quickly find ways to regulate rice and grain in various places in order to curb its rise; at the same time, it is hoped that the people will save rice and grain as much as possible and use more miscellaneous grains, and it is especially necessary to strictly prevent miscellaneous grains from taking the opportunity to increase prices.</p>
<p>Regarding the rice and grain problem, it is harmful and useless to hold a panic mentality. What we should pay attention to is how to implement practical solutions, which is the fundamental way!</p>
<p>Translation of Opinion</p>
<h3>The Moral Righteousness of Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>The plan of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee to mobilize Shanghai's private capital to lend to the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu has been mentioned many times, and we have also pointed out its importance. Fortunately, the preparations in Shanghai are nearing completion, and it will soon be lent to farmers. Not only will farmers in the rice-producing areas be overjoyed, but all those who care about China's agricultural interests and farmers will feel gratified.</p>
<p>The greatest significance of the 5 billion yuan agricultural loan lies in the correct understanding by Shanghai's powerful people of the inseparability of Shanghai and the local areas, and the deep understanding that in order to solve Shanghai's food problem, it is necessary to cooperate with the rice-producing areas to increase agricultural production, and this has been put into practice. In his letter to the Governor of Jiangsu Province, Mr. Li Sihao specifically clarified this point, and mentioned that the solution to Shanghai's food problem must wait for the increase in production in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, and therefore it is even more necessary to alleviate the suffering of farmers. These words are appropriate. Furthermore, it is more precious that the knowledge and office circles and the financial circles of Shanghai can take this into consideration and express their attitude of sharing the suffering of Jiangsu farmers than the economic effects obtained after the implementation of agricultural loans.</p>
<p>The economic significance of agricultural loans has been discussed many times. It can not only open up a way for urban idle funds, but also prevent the deterioration of inflation. At the same time, providing farmers with production funds is enough to increase the agricultural and farmers' welfare. From this point of view, this move is indeed a win-win situation. Although the impact of the 5 billion agricultural loan on Shanghai's economy is still difficult to quantify, it is worth noting how significant a role this fund will play in rural areas. It is expected that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be able to fulfill its responsibilities and truly distribute the agricultural loan funds to farmers at low interest rates. Furthermore, the lofty political morality shown in the deployment of agricultural loan funds will surely be shown again in the process of lending them. Therefore, farmers will have unlimited well-being, and there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Regarding the terms of the agricultural loan, Shanghai has almost no conditions, and the attitude of entrusting the Jiangsu Provincial authorities with full power to handle it, and the Jiangsu Province has also expressed its willingness to actively cooperate to solve Shanghai's food problem, are all worthy of special mention. The fact that this agricultural loan is implemented without the use of an abacus is enough to show the morality of both parties. This lofty moral concept will surely be consistent throughout the lending process of agricultural loans and when they are returned.</p>
<p>When this agricultural loan is implemented, what we hope for first is to make full use of the cooperatives that can now best grasp agriculture, and second, the Wuxi and Changshu areas, which are now attracting attention from the general public, should be used as key areas for agricultural loans and actively loaned. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is of course very familiar with the local situation, and without our hope, the above two points should also be realized; however, from the nature of agricultural loans, these two points should also be hoped for. Agricultural loans, in their essence, are a strong link linking Shanghai and the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, and are very moral in nature. This is what we especially feel when agricultural loans are put into practice. (Mainland News, May 30)</p>
<h3>Okinawa's Heavy Rains Impede Enemy Advance; Military Commentator Discusses Recent Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent battle situation on Okinawa Island, due to the impact of the rainy season, although Japanese and American forces are engaged in fierce fighting, both sides are finding it difficult to make progress. A military commentator in this city provides a detailed observation of the recent situation on Okinawa Island.</p>
<p>Rainy Season Hinders Land Warfare</p>
<p>On the battle front: Currently, intense artillery battles continue on the outskirts of Naha and Shuri. Enemy British and American forces are suffering increasing casualties, and enemy war leaders also acknowledge that future bloodshed will become even more substantial. However, recently, continuous heavy rain in that area has made progress difficult for both Japanese and American forces. In the last ten days of May alone, rainfall exceeded six inches. It is expected that the rainfall will become even more intense after the beginning of June, so it is believed that there will be no significant progress in the fighting between Japanese and American forces in the next three weeks. According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent dispatched from Okinawa on the 29th, the mud in Naha is unprecedented, leaving no means of transportation other than walking. The correspondent also claimed to have walked several miles and witnessed more than a dozen American tanks destroyed by the Japanese army along the way. Currently, American troops marching towards the outskirts of Shuri, including medics and howitzer units, must walk. Although there are returning transport vehicles, they are full of soldiers who have died in battle.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships Suffer Losses Exceeding Ten Vessels</p>
<p>On the sea front, Japanese special attack units continue to brave adverse weather to strike the enemy. According to enemy reports, since the 28th and 29th, Japanese forces have launched extremely fierce attacks on their ships, damaging more than ten enemy vessels. The enemy is experiencing unexpected fear of Japanese special attack units, and various reports describe their long-term capabilities. According to a recent broadcast from San Francisco, Okinawa Island is quite far from the American mainland compared to Iwo Jima. Okinawa is 375 nautical miles from the Japanese mainland and 4,600 nautical miles from Pearl Harbor. Therefore, American forces are fighting under a heavy burden due to this inverse proportion. It is truly difficult for the American fleet to annihilate the Japanese fleet under these unfavorable conditions. It is particularly noteworthy that repeated attacks by Japanese aircraft are damaging American ships, and the United States is facing extreme difficulties in replenishing ships. The number of ships lost in the waters off Okinawa on the 24th and 25th alone is clearly evident. Although American forces dispatched aircraft to defend themselves in the air and used naval guns to resist Japanese aircraft attacks, they still lost more than ten ships. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee the safety of United Nations ships. If the damage suffered by the United States on Okinawa cannot be addressed by reinforcing troops in that area, it will be difficult for British and American forces to secure an ideal forward base on the Pacific front in the future.</p>
<p>Special Attack Unit Members Kill a Hundred Each</p>
<p>The achievements of the Japanese special attack units, with the heroic sacrifice of 440 young members, have inflicted the following damage on the enemy: A total of 29 vessels sunk, including three regular aircraft carriers, two battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, one unidentified type of warship, and eighteen transport ships. A total of 54 vessels damaged, including seven regular aircraft carriers, one escort carrier, six battleships, nine cruisers, one destroyer, one torpedo boat, one unidentified type of warship, and eighteen transport ships. Regarding enemy personnel losses, based on the lowest estimates of 50% casualties for sunken vessels and 30% for damaged vessels, the U.S. Navy has suffered at least 33,075 casualties. There are still many unconfirmed achievements of the special attack units that are not included in this count. According to this explicit report, the sacrifice of 440 members of the Japanese special attack units annihilated more than 30,000 enemy sailors, with each person killing an average of 75 enemies, effectively killing a hundred each. Japan has millions of heroic young people with the spirit of courageously killing the enemy, and we can confidently achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Continue on Various Luzon Islands</p>
<p>Battle situation in the Southwest Pacific: The battles on Luzon Island are currently raging in the areas of Santa Fe and Cagayan. Fierce fighting continues in Malaybalay in the interior of Mindanao. In Burma, there is fierce fighting in the area of Pyay on the Waw road, 32 kilometers southeast of Yangon, and southeast of Mengdong on the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese garrison on Tarakan is currently engaging the enemy in landing battles. Regarding the aforementioned combat situation in the Southwest Pacific, the Japanese army is temporarily refraining from taking proactive actions due to supply constraints. However, on each battlefield, they are skillfully luring the enemy with large forces, aiming to inflict massive casualties.</p>
<p>Full Preparations for Landing Operations</p>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch dated May 28th, the U.S. Navy Department announced on that day that the composite Task Force 88, a powerful U.S. Navy escort carrier task force with strong naval tactics and air power, had completed its mission after three large-scale amphibious operations and eight months of combat in the Pacific and is now returning home for rest. However, the actions of this unit and its future operational intentions are still difficult to predict. However, according to a London dispatch dated the 28th, the Japanese military command is now preparing to respond to new actions by the main forces of British and American armies based on realistic considerations. The Japanese army has also prepared new deployments to deal with future attempted landings by the British and Americans on the coasts of China or the Japanese mainland. In addition, Graham, a special correspondent stationed in Chongqing, also criticized the mainland operations, with subtle implications in his words. However, in the future battle situation, we should also be vigilant.</p>
<p>American Production Shifts to Civilian Needs</p>
<p>Furthermore, a broadcast from San Francisco on the 30th stated that the United States has tightened military production. Krug, Director of the U.S. War Production Board, estimated that the price has been reduced to 7 billion U.S. dollars, but it will still need to be supplemented if large quantities of materials are required. At the same time, personnel, materials, and industrial productivity have considerable strength to enhance civilian needs production. The current environment of peace and tranquility in the United States is the reason for promoting the transfer of production to civilian needs. According to an announcement by the U.S. Army Air Headquarters on the 28th, the Fairlea factory, with a capital of one million dollars, will stop production of the four-engine B-24 aircraft from June 15th.</p>
<p>International Disputes in Continental Europe and the Near East</p>
<p>Recent changes in the international situation, such as France's sudden shift to the left, are vastly different from the right-wing Franco regime in Spain. Therefore, the future relationship between France and Spain is worthy of attention. Furthermore, party struggles in Italy are becoming increasingly prominent. Turning our eyes eastward, we see the complex situation in Syria and Lebanon due to the relationship between Britain and France. Since the end of the First World War, international disputes have been common. The recent reports of the Syria-Lebanon incident are becoming more tense. British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons on May 29th that the Syria-Lebanon incident hinders the progress of the war against Japan and cannot allow its expansion. He called on all parties to exercise serious restraint, saying that French forces had increased their troop presence in Syria by only 500 men, and the British government is actively consulting with the French government. The conflicts in the Middle East will affect transportation lines to East Asia. Prime Minister Eden also announced the next day that Britain is in discussions with France to resolve the Syria-Lebanon incident. On that day, Syrian acting Prime Minister Jamali met with the British and American ambassadors for consultations and held a special cabinet meeting. At a time when the European war has just ended, complex disputes are emerging endlessly. Even if this Second World War ends, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not trigger a Third World War.</p>

<h3>Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Week Commences Today; Urge Citizens to Cooperate in Air Defense and Encourage Well Digging</h3>
<p>The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters will implement "Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Week" starting today (1st) to thoroughly strengthen air defense equipment, urging the public to cooperate in air defense tasks and strengthen air defense facilities. Regardless of fire prevention equipment, air defense equipment, and lighting control equipment, all must automatically check and strive for perfection in accordance with the key points stipulated by the headquarters. The headquarters will also send personnel to inspect households. Those who perform well will be rewarded, and those who are deficient will be corrected and reformed. At the same time, to encourage well digging, citizens who dig artesian wells during the "Strengthen Air Defense Facilities Week" from today (1st) to the 9th will have their costs specially reduced as agreed upon by the headquarters and various well-digging companies. It is hoped that citizens will respond and strive to make the city's air defense posture more perfect and strong.</p>
<p>Air Defense Water Pond Replacement Measures</p>
<p>The air defense water ponds built in various places in this city should be replaced with fresh water frequently as summer approaches. However, because the consumption of tap water is currently subject to strict restrictions, the fines for exceeding the limit are very high, resulting in a lack of attention to replacing the water in these air defense water ponds. It is now learned that the authorities have contacted the water and electricity company and reached an agreement. All air defense water ponds can replace water three times a month, and the required amount of water will still be calculated at ordinary prices. However, before doing so, a form should be filled out, stating the location of the water pond and the volume of the water pond (cubic meters), and submitted to the chief of the Lianbao for verification before applying to the water and electricity company. The application locations are: For the old District 1, at the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company on Jiangxi Road; at the Shanghai Water Branch, the Huazhong Water and Electricity North Sichuan Road Business Office in Hongkou and Zhabei; at the Huazhong Water and Electricity South City Business Office on Zhonghua Road in the South City; and at the French Concession Waterworks on Lingshi Road in the old District 8.</p>
<p>Various Cinemas Screen Slides</p>
<p>In addition, for the purpose of expanding publicity, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters has produced a film slide for the Air Defense Strengthening Promotion Week, which contains detailed information on the construction methods of personal air defense trenches in emergencies, etc. Starting today, all major theaters in the city will screen the slides, and at the same time, the significance of strengthening air defense facilities will be broadcast.</p>
<h3>Food Supply for This City Actively Being Purchased and Transported; Relevant Authorities Pledge Assistance</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of food supply for the people, according to the authorities in charge, they are currently actively purchasing and transporting food and have obtained the assistance of the relevant authorities, so there will be no shortage of rice. The recent surge in rice prices is entirely caused by unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market. The executive authorities are conducting a thorough investigation of unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, and they will be severely punished according to the law. It is hoped that the general public will not cause unnecessary alarm.</p>
<h3>Director Liu of the Economic Bureau Assumes Office Today</h3>
<p>Xu Jiang, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, has submitted his resignation due to illness. The vacancy will be filled by Liu Xingchen, Director of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office.

It is learned that Director Liu, upon receiving the order, supervised the completion of all tasks on May 31 and will go to the Economic Bureau at 9:00 AM today (1st) to assume office.</p>
<h3>Coal Mining and Transportation by the Coal Association; Production in Central China</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Joint Association is currently implementing adjustments to its internal organization in order to strengthen coal mining and transportation operations. As coal production on the Central China Jinghu Line has increased sharply, but transportation is extremely difficult due to the lack of transportation means, the association is now seeking to facilitate procurement and has decided to set up an office in Nanjing to specifically manage the mining and transportation of coal produced in nearby mines and to liaise with the authorities. It is expected that it can be formally established by the middle of this month. It is heard that the operation of this office will be able to satisfactorily resolve the fuel needs of Shanghai's industry in the future.</p>
<h3>Township Clearing Office Sends Personnel to Inspect Hengsha Island</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen and consolidate the security of the six islands outside the Wusong Estuary, including Jisha, Yawo Sha, Ruifeng Sha, and Dashitou Sha, the municipal government has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to establish the Shanghai Special Municipality Hengsha Special District Office to handle township clearing matters in the Hengsha area and ordered the Township Clearing Affairs Bureau to immediately handle preparatory matters. The Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Su Chengde, Director of the Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the preparations for the Hengsha Special District Office. According to him, "The six islands, including Jisha, are located outside the Wusong Estuary and were originally under the jurisdiction of the Pubei District Office. The current municipal government authorities believe that these islands are strategically important and are setting up the Hengsha Special District Office in this area to handle township clearing matters in order to thoroughly strengthen and consolidate security.

<h3>Livestock Business Special Tax Adjusted Valuation</h3>

Therefore, after referring to the city's situation, the bureau has readjusted and revised the valuation to 80,000 yuan per pig, with a tax of 4,000 yuan; 300,000 yuan per cattle, donkey, or horse, with a tax of 15,000 yuan; and 40,000 yuan per calf, with a tax of 2,040 yuan (based on 100 catties), and 10,000 yuan for sheep or goats. The revision has been submitted to the municipal government for approval and will be uniformly collected based on the new valuation from June 1st of this year.</p>

<h3>Land Tax in Seven Counties to Be Collected in Kind from Today; Rice as the Standard</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipality will collect land tax in kind. The Finance Bureau plans to collect it in two seasons each year. The collection period for land tax in the 34th year of the Republic will be collected in three installments from June 1st and seven installments from October 1st. The areas to be collected include Fengxian, Nanxiang, Chuansha, Chongming, Jiading, Baoshan, Shenjiang, and other seven counties, with a total of 4.27 million mu of farmland. It is estimated that 390,000 dan of in-kind tax can be collected, with rice as the standard. Rice will be collected uniformly in the urban area. Rice will be the principle for each district. If it is indeed not a rice-producing area, wheat may be substituted. The conversion ratio is as follows: 16 catties of rice is converted into three sheng for wheat, two sheng, eight he, and five shao for middle-grade wheat, two sheng and five he and two shao for lower-grade wheat, two sheng and one he for the first-grade upper wheat, two sheng, eight he and nine shao for the first-grade middle wheat, one sheng, six he and eight shao for the first-grade lower wheat, one sheng, three he and two shao for the second-grade upper wheat, one sheng and two he for the second-grade middle wheat, and nine he for the second-grade lower wheat. The fractions are rounded to the nearest shao. The income from this rice will be used for the rice ration for the municipal government and its affiliated bureau's civil servants. If calculated at three dou per person per month, each person will need a total of three dan and six dou per year. Based on the distribution to 60,000 people, more than 230,000 dan will be needed each year. The excess amount collected will be selectively distributed.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Approving the Transport of Gold and Silver Passports Promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, Effective Today</h3>
<p>Nanjing, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch – We have received reliable information from the Ministry of Finance stating that the transport of gold and silver by merchants and civilians has a significant impact on finance and must be clearly regulated to facilitate review and prevent abuses. Recently, local gold and silver jewelry trade associations have reported that the raw materials for manufacturing and selling gold and silver ornaments require adjustment and transportation between businesses in different locations, which involves many dangers along the way. To avoid unexpected losses, they requested that gold and silver transport passports be issued according to the regulations for the transport of silver passports to provide relief. The Ministry of Finance considers the above-mentioned facts to be true and has formulated regulations and passport samples for approving the transport of gold and silver passports, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. It is scheduled to be promulgated and implemented on June 1st of this year and will be circulated to the provincial and municipal governments for their information and to instruct their subordinates accordingly. Furthermore, this passport is of great importance and has a significant impact on the local financial market. Therefore, the regulations for approving the transport of gold and silver passports clearly stipulate that when merchants and civilians apply, the person in charge must sign and affix their seal and obtain a guarantee from a reputable local store, which must be submitted to the ministry for approval and issuance. When gold and silver jewelry businesses apply, they must obtain a guarantee from the trade association with responsible certification, which must be submitted to the ministry for verification. If necessary, the Ministry of Finance may take into account local conditions and impose restrictions or temporarily suspend issuance at any time to ensure seriousness. The regulations for approving the transport of gold and silver passports are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Article 1: Anyone transporting gold exceeding twenty taels or silver exceeding one hundred taels to various domestic locations must complete an application form stating the type (gold, silver, gold ornaments, or silver ornaments), quantity, purpose, number of packages, and loading and unloading locations. The person in charge must sign and affix their seal and submit a guarantee from a reputable local store to the Ministry of Finance for verification and issuance of a transport passport before transport can begin. If transporting without a passport and discovered by military police or customs checkpoints along the way, the Ministry of Finance must be immediately notified for handling.</p>
<p>Article 2: Gold and silver jewelry businesses purchasing raw materials and transporting gold and silver must, in addition to complying with the provisions of the preceding article, also obtain a guarantee with responsible certification from the trade association when obtaining the passport, which must be submitted to the ministry for verification. Those who obtain a guarantee from the trade association in accordance with the preceding paragraph are exempt from submitting the store guarantee stipulated in the preceding article.</p>
<p>Article 3: The transport passport, in addition to being inspected and released by the customs checkpoints in accordance with regulations, should be exempt from inspection by military police along the way. However, during periods of martial law, if inspection is deemed necessary, it may still be carried out. However, it may be moved to a secure location at the request of the person to ensure caution.</p>
<p>Article 4: The validity period of the transport passport shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance at any time.</p>
<p>Article 5: Only one transport passport shall be issued per person, and each passport shall only be used once. After use, it shall be returned to the ministry for cancellation and shall not be transferred to others for use.</p>
<p>Article 6: A passport fee of one thousand yuan and a stamp tax of ten yuan shall be paid for each passport.</p>
<p>Article 7: These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
