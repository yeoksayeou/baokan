<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營九日下午三時發表：　四月八日冲繩島之敵第一綫，大概在津覇大山各南方一帶，敵逐次增强兵力，反復來攻，然當地日軍部隊勇敢善戰，隨時將之擊退。自敵登陸以來，至四月七日薄暮所判明之陸上綜合戰果如次：予敵之損害，計殺傷敵兵三千六百名，擱置或燃燒戰車一百〇二輛，破壞各種大砲三十三門，擊沉登陸用舟艇十六艘，日方損害，戰死傷約四百名。　攻擊該島附近之敵艦船，四月六日以來所獲戰果中，其後經已判明者如次：擊沉大型艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦十艘，掃海　三艘，艦型不詳者十三艘。擊毀巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦四艘，掃海艇二艘，艦型不詳者八艘，此外，自四月六日夕於陸上望見殘波岬西方海而，有敵輸送船多艘起火燃燒中。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　冲繩決戰已達最高潮，敵艦船被擊沉計達　十四艘之多，累計自上月二十三日以來之綜合戰果，擊沉並擊破艦船　達二百四十五艘。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日陸海特攻隊　大規模攻擊　在沖繩周邊獲大戰果 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日陸海軍特別攻擊隊，六日終日對冲繩本島周邊之敵艦船羣加以大規模之攻擊，獲得戰果如次：　嘉手納西方海面，擊沉艦型不詳者二艘，擊沉運輸船五艘，焚毀起火巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，型艦不詳者三艘，運輸船六艘。　系滿西方海面轟沉驅逐艦三艘。　系滿西南方海面，擊沉艦型不詳者一艘，焚毀起火艦型不詳者一艘。　湊川南方海面，轟沉大型艦二艘（其中一艘為戰艦成分多），小型艦二艘，擊破戰艦一艘，焚毀起火驅逐艦一艘，艦種不詳者五艘，小型艦兩艘，合計轟炸擊沉十五艘，擊破焚毀二十一艘。又據冲繩本島報吿稱，是日對名護灣口及瀨底島。伊江島中間附近之敵艦船，日軍特攻隊所獲戰果中，由陸上判明者如次：轟沉巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦五艘，掃海艇三艘，艦型不詳者一艘，擊沉驅逐艦三艘，艦型不詳者七艘，重創起火戰艦二艘，巡洋艦六艘，驅逐艦二艘，掃海艇二艘，艦型不詳者一艘。根據以上六日日軍特別攻擊隊所獲戰果中，截止現在業巳判明者，轟沉擊沉三十七艘，擊破焚毀三十四艘，收獲赫赫戰果。七日晟日航空部隊為呼應陸上戰鬥，仍繼續對沖繩本島嘉手納方面之敵軍連續實行轟炸。又是日下午日軍神風特攻隊攻擊冲繩東方海面之敵機動部隊，予以重創。</p>
<p>敵機動隊重創向東方遁走中</p>
<p>太平洋某基地九日中央社電　日空軍對蝟築於琉球羣島之敵英·美聯合機動部隊，依然繼續熾烈攻擊，由四月五日至七日未明，所收戰果，依日本大本營於入日發表計，擊沉十五艘，擊毀九艘。據七日午後偵察所得，九州南東二百哩海上，以制式空母二艘及特設　空母一艘為基幹之敵機動部隊，拖曳長二千米突之油跡，向東南方遁走。該一隊至少有數艘已蒙重傷，此外，在奄美大島東方百二十至百三十哩之海上，以特設空母四艘為基幹之敵機動部隊，亦向東方遁定中。冲繩本島東方百哩之海上，有空母三艘，戰艦二艘為主幹之敵機動部隊，稍南方復有以空母及戰艦各一艘為基幹之敵機動部隊，此外，尙有以空母二艘乃至四艘為基幹之敵機動部隊，游航於本島南方百四十乃至百五十哩之海上。日特別攻擊隊於七日夕刻，攻擊冲繩本島東方之敵機動部隊，全隊果敢碰撞敵艦，據偵察機之報吿，敵艦隊中至少有四五艘已蒙重創，結果敵艦遂陷於大混亂狀態中，艦列分齜或大傾斜，或速力頓減，而向東遁走。四日以來，所有戰果，除大本營八日所發者外，尙有相當之損失。</p>

<p>東京九日中央社電　日鈴木首相八日上午十一時許在首相官邸首次招待記者團，發表談話，略謂：今日戰局之激烈進展，乃為吾人所料及者，誠不足驚異，吾人今日以美國為對象作戰，恰與日俄戰爭時之情况相同，是時，日本元老亦認為日本不足以戰勝俄國，然結果日本以非戰不可的形勢下，終獲勝利。此次戰爭亦為非戰不可之形勢，故者人最後勝利亦必獲得。至此，記者團復向首相提出對戰局之見解問題，鈴本首相對此答稱，此次戰爭，吾人必獲勝利，所謂勝利，幷非指各個戰塲上之勝負而言，而是以士氣為決勝之重因。例如，德川家康於三方原一役敗於武田信玄而歸濱松，但此役德川之用兵及士氣，已成為最後獲得勝利之要素，目下硫磺島等地之戰爭，余幷不認為是失敢，蓋硫黃島等地之戰事，充分表現日本國民信念與氣魄，已為確信不渝之信念。</p>
<h3 id="c5">廣播要旨 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　鈴木首相八日下午七時以「拜受大命」為題，廣播如次：戰局之歸趨，實不容樂觀，雖有賴前綫將士之奮戰，後方之努力生產，然頑敵與木土之距離日近一日，而挽救危急之道，除激揚國民之敵愾心，以及集中國家總力，萬衆一心外，別無他途。以世界戰局而觀，大國未必取勝，小國未必即敗，小國欲勝大國，必須聯合全力以赴，日本對頑敵英美作戰，今日之事態，乃當然之趨勢，不足驚奇。吾人以捨身取義之決心，戰至最後一兵一卒，必可予敵以澈底之打擊，希望國人團結一致共赴國難，急速遵行政府各種方策，以期展開新局面，以保社稷之安寗。</p>

<p>菲律賓基地九日中央社電　敵軍以約百艘之運輸船侵入宿務附近，急圖增强陸上兵力資材，日海軍陸戰隊與陸軍部隊協力，對登睦之敵部隊加以猛烈反攻。自入四月以來，在此四日間，於該方面予敵軍之損害，計擊毀輸送船一艘，殺傷敵兵約七百人，炸毀火器十五件，並焚毀住宅，軍需品十餘所。馬尼刺東方據點之日有力部隊，三日進入門達爾西方三公里地點，與敵軍以甚大之損害，三日夜使馬尼刺東方馬皺領兵舍附近三處發生大爆炸。同時，拉克那湖方面日軍部隊，一日强攻企圖向碧瑤挺進之敵，該地附近戰綫之日砲兵部隊，對四日來襲巴爾克斯東方約五公里陣地之敵，加以砲擊擊退，五日下午炸毀敵速射砲二門，裝甲車，彈藥車各三輛。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日新閣特徵 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　此次盟邦小磯首相鑒於時局日趨緊迫，為求有更强有力之內閣，以應付萬全，乃決意讓賢，繼之而起者鈴木海軍大將，業已迅速完成組閣使命，以嶄新之姿態，出現於世界風雲緊張之秋，舉世各國對此次鈴木內閣無不寄予莫大重視，尤以大東亞各民族更深切期待。綜合各方對此次新閣改組之觀感，不外為對國內力來團結一致，發揮決戰總力，尤對飛機增產方面集中全力，以謀本土防衛之堅强，對國外方面，一本過去方針，加强東亞各國之團結，以共謀東亞全體之解放。</p>
<p>此次內閣特徵有二：　以重臣為中心，組成更强力之內閣，　新內閣開僚以海軍關係者居多，此對來日日本海軍之發展至堪期待。對蘇聯方面，想新內閣當仍能一本前閣方針，向前推進。又此次內閣結成，適當日本新政黨成立之後，新閣員中亦有兩位是新黨中人，今後軍民之聯繫，當益緊密。</p>
<h3 id="c9">日新閣推行　決戰政治 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊　日大本營八日發表，四月五日深夜，在冲繩本島四周海空作戰時，擊沉或擊毀特設空母兩艘，戰艦一艘以及其他艦船等共計二十四艘，但敵方廣播仍一貫作風，力謀諱飾所受損害，僅玳認驅逐艦三艘遭擊沉。美方雖宣傳其損失極微，除驅逐艦三艘外，復有飛機七架喪失，然一方面說明英方參加該役之三萬五干噸主力艦喬治五世號因日航空隊　中攻擊，受重創面臨陣脫逃，由此一點已見敵方宣傳如何矛盾。</p>
<p>此次冲繩本島四周海空戰，據東京電報，日木航空隊及水上艦隊均成為特別攻擊隊，以堅決戰意擊滅敵人，適於此時，鈴木內閣　小磯內閣之後誕生，新首相鈴木貫太郞大將談話由稱：「余決意以老軀站於國民諸君最前綫，處理國政，希望諸君越過余之屍體，抱勇猛心發揚新戰力，以安聖心」。</p>
<p>查上次大戰時，法國克里孟梭首相以七十七歲之高齡，終將法國挽回頹勢，今年七十九歲之老首相鈴木貫太郞大將亦抱決心，領導舉國人民作戰到底，鈴木內閣以阿南·米內陸海兩相，集中政治與戰略之一致，以謀强力推進決戰施策，新內閣更受各重臣之强力支持以及國民之信仰。在此苛烈戰局下，鈴本大將以全國人民配置於決戰陣機，發號施令，日本現在對外能在冲繩四週獲得偉大戰果，對內則有鈴木內閣强力推行決戰政治，政府軍官民亦各以特攻精神，向擊滅敵人之途邁進，吾人莫不寄與極大期待。</p>

<h3 id="c13">再論上海工業界出路 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>講到整個工業建設的前途，我們會針對中國經濟偏畸於若干大城市的不合理現象，而一貫主張適材適地適人的均衡發展，否則，談不到消滅中國經濟上的殖民地特徵，也就談不到改造社會經濟。</p>
<p>道一理論和方針，同樣適合於上海今後的工業建設問題；且因上海向為我國經濟金融尤共是工業的中心，這種木質上的改革應山上海工業界率先倡行。其次，僅就上海目前的實際環境而言，隨着戰局的進展，隨時可能遭受空襲破壞，更因煤斤缺乏，電力限制，原料不敷，運輸阻滯等等困難，一時未易好轉，與其陷於坐吃山空的窘境，不如早作積極打算，另謀出路。所以，我們近更屢次主張上海工業急應向內地疏散。</p>
<p>目前對於上海工業疏散，論者有兩種主張，第一，凡比較大型的工廠，向淮海省轉移，在該地區建設未來的輕工業基礎；第二，凡比較規模小的工廠，特別是日用品工業，向江蘇省各縣疏散，利用各縣特產原料，並適應各該地農村需要，建設日用品小型工廠。我們認為這兩種主張，無論為戰後中國新工業建設計，或為今日上海工商業打開出路計，均有進一步研究實踐的必要。前者暫不置論，關於向江蘇各縣設立日用品小型工廠一點，爰再補　申論如次：</p>
<p>第一，上海工業界向江蘇各縣疏散，設立小型日用品工廠，是工業界木身為適應環境謀取出路，因此，工業界應自動的迅起妥籌對策。但為合理的發展，應該有組織有計劃有步　的進行，竭力避免畸形發展，有如過去小型紗廠因有利可圖，即競相設立。應先就江蘇各縣特產原料，及農村特殊需要乃至交通運輸等條件，確定建立工廠之種類及數量。</p>
<p>第二，上海工商界，尤其是資金充裕的各工廠，應即進行調査研究，向各縣投資設廠，或利用當地原有手工業給與資金上技衛上的扶助，俾使發展。</p>
<p>第三，政府當局與金融界方面，應對工業界向各縣設立日用品小型工廠者，給與資金上，資材搬運上，及治安保障上種種協助與便利。必要時並給予獎勵和津貼。對於小工廠出品，予以免稅減稅等優惠</p>

<p>東京九日中央社電　鈴木首相於組閣之初，即擬任命前外相東鄕茂德氏為外相兼大東亞相，然因東鄉氏居於輕井澤，於七日之親任式以前未能抵京，因之，目下由首相暫兼攝外相及大東亞相，以迄於今。嗣東鄕氏應電召。於七日親任式終了後，會見首相，交涉入閣之事，並求予以猶豫期間，以期愼重考慮。九日下午五時，復至首相官邸訪問首相，作重要會談，因施策大綱意見完全一致，故已應諾入閣，下午於宮中舉行親任式，同時業由情報局發表。按東鄕氏為廣島縣人，六十四歲，明治四十一年東大畢業後入外務省，昭和八年任歐美局長及歐亞局長，繼締結日·德·義防共協定，旋於昭和十二年秋任駐德大使，於日·德提携甚為盡力。昭和十四年秋，轉任駐蘇大使，十六年任東條內閣外相，十七年九月辭職退休，嗣被敕選為貴族院議員以迄今日。</p>

<h3 id="c15">太倉現况 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— （朱銘）</p>
<p>滬太間之交通綫有二：一為滬太公路，有長途汽車直達太倉，中途如汽車機件不生障礙，四小時左右可抵太倉城西門外。華中鐵道所營長途汽車，車站在虬江路，原定每日兩班（上午九時，下午二時），實際常只有晨九時一班，如遇天雨尙須停駛。每車載客原規定四十人，現多至五十人以上。目前商營車行甚多，來往較前方便，旅途尙稱安寗，但公路路面高低不平，頗有類簸之苦，又因橋樑破壞，中途時需下車步行。如由上海乘小汽車至南翔或嘉定，則可改搭內河船至太倉城內，此路時間較長，但甚經濟。</p>
<p>如人數有五六人，小件行李稍多，則以在上海包一小汽車直達太倉城內，較為便利，車價約在八萬元左右。</p>
<p>太倉之生活程度與上海相仿，茲將主要日用品價格列後：</p>
<p>米（石）　七萬元</p>
<p>柴（擔）　三千元</p>
<p>油（斤）　一千元</p>
<p>肉（斤）　八百元</p>
<p>菠菜（斤）　三百卅元</p>
<p>電　每度五百元</p>
<p>當地米糧本可自給，現因受米販影響，存米只可供至四月中旬，現欲一次購入三四斗，必須遠至西門或北門外數里。據聞離北門愈遠，價格愈低。</p>
<p>太倉城現有居民二萬五千人，市面以西門較佳。城內租屋房金以米計算，普通十六呎闊十六呎長之房間，每月索米一斗半，合一萬元左右，此項制度曾由縣府禁止，然陽奉陰遠者仍多。</p>
<p>維持治安者有憲兵隊，警備隊，保安隊，公安局等，一般情形，尙稱良好。城內有高級中學二所，初級中等四所，小學三所，學齡兒童入學者不多，敎育不甚發達。</p>

<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：過去一週乃西綫戰事最緊張之一週。白萊門·漢諾威·歐法特·紐勒姆堡·斯托圖加特等著名城市皆已迫近戰綫，現德軍在各點之抵抗，已漸著成效。目前自極北至極南之戰綫，自安亭向東，再折向西北，經亞爾梅洛明登諾特霍森而至德國心臟，再向西面折向西南，經埃森納許。施溫福特·胡茲堡·海爾勃倫而至卡爾斯魯厄成一半圓形。目前東綫自柏林至沃特前綫法闌克福·庫斯特林各地，雖相距僅六十公里，但在過去一週，並未能絲毫影響西綫之抵抗。西綫極北翼之戰况，極可注意，威塞區近確極緊張，德國最重要海港之一白萊門已受威脅，惟德軍堅强部隊已自荷蘭撤退駐守於的萊門迤西一帶。</p>

<p>政府最高經濟顧問小倉正恆氏，此次因公由京專程來　，昨（九）日下午四時，特偕同新木經濟顧問在外　興亞大　，會見本市中國　　記者，小倉最高顧問對中國資源戰力化，及抑平物價等問題，發表談話表示　又答覆記得所提示之總問題頗多，茲分　如次：</p>
<p>小倉顧問談話</p>
<h3 id="c26">前線後方同樣重要 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>小倉最高顧問談話原文：（好久不見諸位，最近時局進展甚速，僅僅二三個月以前的事就像很久的一件事情。當此敵方既已爬上菲易，奪得硫黃島，進而登陛於沖繩華島的一部份，同時在日漸強烈　炸內外各重要都市之今日，前線與後方看做同樣重要。無論本土或是現地，直接連結於作戰的態勢亦很快的確立了，這是當然的事。當此時我們必須慮心正視戰局，并且不拘於形式或過去的流弊，而實施果斷的措施，以便準備好可以就會將來發生之任何情勢，目不待言。經濟方面的事決不可後於作戰，以此日華軍官民須要更緊密的勢，且以新的決心去連進聖戰的完隊。）</p>
<h3 id="c27">中國資源應戰力化 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>蔽人以為中國現在對於日本固然成為大東亞各地域之中最大兵站地，可是鑒于戰局的推展各界皆要加倍努力於中國資源戰略化。就華中的問題而言，　　問題實為中心問題，因　　成績不但直接與戰力有關，且對於民生亦有甚大的影響，故請各地方官民更進一步的去奮勉。雖然　　問題同為重要，然而運輸問題或是輕工業振興的問題，說起來很容易，但實際上把他做好卻是很難。現各方面對此問題很努力，可是各般情勢其一部份好像漸漸的惡化起來，但是這種情形在敵方也有此現象，我們還要努力倒底，決不可改變。目前徒然對戰和惡化情勢能做到一分，就得滿意一分的地步，但我們接續努力，就一定可以改善，而我們的辛苦，亦有代價。</p>
<h3 id="c28">戰局發展與我有利 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>敵人深信此次戰爭之勝利必屬於我。敵方越接近日本本土而其補給路線越延長，戰局似乎越發慢慢的展開於我方有利的狀態，並且顯露出敵方的焦急。當然今後戰爭態勢當益趨於凄愴苛烈，敵人想我們如果百折不回的打下去，敵方目然會退卻。時至今日忍耐艱苦是東亞各民族應行之路，決不是能不費力而得爭取勝利之榮冠，換言這，就是一個人也不可拱手旁觀，蔽人想人想中日兩國民要趁著現在百尺竿頭更進步，而密發一番，方不愧為對與亞大業做最大的贡献，倘此種清神能夠徹底做到，則物價也就可受到好的影響。　思華中近來物價昂貴的原因非常複雜，原因有如下述：</p>
<h3 id="c29">華中物價勝貴原因 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>中國比其他交戰諸國大有不同，即雖然一面仍擁有豐富的物資，卻不能輾轉流通，以成投機囤積的目標，是物價昂貴的重要原因。觀乎此，做人以為倘自制投機囤積的氣氛參透於經濟界漸而至於其他各方面，就定有很好的結果顯示出來了。諸位知道，觀察華中今日之物價勝勢，對榨油營戰爭經濟而言，或就民生而談，不禁遺憾之至。現中日當局正以非常之熱意推進　抑平方策，但蔽人又想借促進各界之目　目制，亦不失為對抑平物價及擁護通貨措施之重要一環。</p>
<h3 id="c30">答覆問題 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>小倉顧問指謂：值茲大東亞戰爭緊張之際，大東亞全民族在此艱苦時代，尤應緊密協力，積極打成一片，幫不論經濟的政策及任何政策，在　體緊密連系緊下，定有光明激　之前　。如今國府積極增強生產，　各界應加以澈底的認識，以完達最後勝利。旋即答覆所提示各項問題：</p>
<p>1.關於民需配給問題。（答）由於生產及來源關係，猶未能做到普遍配給，今後當使生產增加，及全農民之協力，熱誠信賴統制施策。</p>
<p>2.現鈔流向外埠，有何回流辦法？（答）目　收物資後，現鈔頗有流入農村趨向，希望農民均獲成貯貯金美德，向當地銀行儲蓄，以效法我日本人民固有之精神，則可使通貨圓滑回流。</p>
<p>3.充實物資供應及增加生產，意見如何？（答）除充沛煤斤來源，增加還輸力量外，並積極開發當地　煤，今對　　煤斤，已承日本陸海軍當局共同協力，煤斤採探可無匮乏，今後增產當無問題。</p>
<p>4.　　日本太新　內閣對華經濟政策如何？（答）此次日內閣更調後，對華政策仍一本過去既定方針，繼續實施決無變更。</p>
<p>5.強化戰時經濟統制施策意見如何？（答）值茲戰時經濟及統制，當務以戰力化為中心，增強軍需生產及民需物資。</p>
<p>6.中國新經濟施策如何？（答）國府對此施策已具有基本觀念，積極從事增強生產，同時各省市已遵令拓展村生產工作，皖淮等省最近特培發農村基本人材訓練，強化農村增產。</p>

<p>文化中心小學全體同學來兩說：（在春假前，老師告訴我們申報館要開辦十個義務小學，在我們（文化）裡，開辦的是（申報第七義務小學），這義務小學完全不收費，書籍也免費供給的。我們聽到了，都覺得非常快樂，因為許多邻居的小朋友，有的年齡比我們大，從來沒有進過學校；有的和我們差不多年紀，並曾同過學，現在是扮演了，或者不能整天在校讀書，要幫助爸媽做事情、現在有了這個機會，一部份扮演的小朋友，重新可以進學校受教育，但是有一部份，卻因學額有限，不能錄取而失望地回去了。因此，我們更覺得自已是太幸運了，應該多多的幫助義務小學，使義務小學更普遍的，大量的開設起來。同胞們都有了豐富的知識技能，優良的品性，強健的休魄，那末我們中國，一定能夠建設成一個有秩序而強盛的國家。大家同學就很迅速地決定了在春假裡，盡可能的把可以節省下來的錢，都節省下來，捐助給義務小學，并且把自己讀過的書也捐出來。總計國　二萬三千二百五十元，書七百二十本。希望全上海的同學們，都能夠盡自己的一份力量，那末義務小學，必然能夠開展起來；也許不久的將來，就更有無數的義務中學以至義務大學，普遍的設立起來。</p>

Also, on the afternoon of the same day, Japanese Kamikaze special attack forces attacked an enemy mobile force east of Okinawa, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Enemy Mobile Force Heavily Damaged and Fleeing Eastward</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Pacific, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force is continuing its fierce attacks on the enemy Anglo-American joint mobile force entrenched in the Ryukyu Islands. According to a report released by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the [date obscured], from April 5th to dawn on the 7th, the results were fifteen ships sunk and nine destroyed. According to reconnaissance obtained on the afternoon of the 7th, an enemy mobile force, based on two standard aircraft carriers and one auxiliary aircraft carrier, was dragging an oil slick two kilometers long and fleeing southeast 200 miles southeast of southern Kyushu. At least several ships in this unit had been heavily damaged. In addition, an enemy mobile force based on four auxiliary aircraft carriers was also fleeing eastward 120 to 130 miles east of Amami Oshima. An enemy mobile force consisting mainly of three aircraft carriers and two battleships was located 100 miles east of Okinawa Island. Slightly to the south, there was another enemy mobile force based on one aircraft carrier and one battleship. Furthermore, there were enemy mobile forces based on two to four aircraft carriers cruising 140 to 150 miles south of the island. On the evening of the 7th, Japanese special attack forces attacked the enemy mobile force east of Okinawa Island. The entire force courageously collided with enemy ships. According to reports from reconnaissance aircraft, at least four or five enemy ships had been heavily damaged. As a result, the enemy fleet was thrown into great confusion, with ships scattered, listing heavily, or with greatly reduced speed, and fleeing eastward. All results since the 4th, in addition to those released by the Imperial Headquarters on the 8th, indicate considerable additional losses.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in Burma, which have suffered repeated heavy losses, have advanced to the vicinity of Myinmu west of Mandalay, and about 30 kilometers northeast of Meiktila. There have been no major changes in the situation near the coast of the area.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki Meets with Reporters, Elucidating "Belief in Victory," Concentrating Total National Strength to Protect the Deities and Ensure Tranquility <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki received a group of reporters for the first time at the Prime Minister's official residence at approximately 11:00 AM on the 8th, and gave a speech, stating in brief: The current fierce development of the war situation is something we anticipated and is not surprising. We are currently fighting against the United States, just as we did during the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, Japanese elder statesmen also believed that Japan was not capable of defeating Russia, but as a result of the circumstances forcing Japan to fight, it ultimately achieved victory. This war is also being forced upon us, so we will inevitably achieve final victory. At this point, the reporters asked the Prime Minister about his views on the war situation. Prime Minister Suzuki responded to this by saying that we will certainly win this war. The so-called victory does not refer to wins or losses on individual battlefields, but to morale as a crucial factor in the decisive battle. For example, Tokugawa Ieyasu was defeated by Takeda Shingen at the Battle of Mikatagahara and returned to Hamamatsu, but Tokugawa's tactics and morale in that battle became the key to his eventual victory. I do not consider the battles on Iwo Jima and other places to be failures because the battles on Iwo Jima and other places fully demonstrate the faith and spirit of the Japanese people, which is an unwavering belief.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Summary of Broadcast <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki broadcast the following at 7:00 PM on the 8th, under the title "Receiving the Great Command": The trend of the war situation is by no means optimistic. Although we rely on the brave fighting of the soldiers on the front lines and the hard work of production in the rear, the distance between the stubborn enemy and our homeland is getting closer day by day, and the only way to save the crisis is to arouse the enemy-hating spirit of the people and concentrate total national strength, all with one heart. In terms of the world war situation, a large country will not necessarily win, and a small country will not necessarily lose. If a small country wants to defeat a large country, it must unite all its strength and go all out. Japan is fighting against the stubborn enemies Britain and the United States. Today's situation is a natural trend and is not surprising. We will fight to the last man with the determination to sacrifice ourselves for righteousness and will surely give the enemy a thorough blow. I hope that the people of the country will unite as one to overcome national difficulties and quickly follow the government's various policies to usher in a new situation and protect the tranquility of the nation.</p>

<p>Philippine Base, 9th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces invaded the vicinity of Cebu with approximately one hundred transport ships, urgently attempting to increase land forces and supplies. The Japanese Naval Landing Forces and Army units cooperated to launch fierce counterattacks against the enemy troops that landed. In these four days since the beginning of April, the damage inflicted on the enemy forces in this area includes one transport ship destroyed, approximately 700 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 15 pieces of ordnance destroyed, and more than 10 residential buildings and military supplies burned. A strong Japanese force from a stronghold east of Manila entered a location three kilometers west of Mendar on the 3rd, inflicting significant damage on enemy forces. On the night of the 3rd, three major explosions occurred near the Ma Chou barracks east of Manila. At the same time, Japanese forces in the Laguna de Bay area launched a strong attack on the enemy attempting to advance towards Baguio on the 1st. The Japanese artillery unit near the battle line in that area shelled and repelled the enemy that attacked positions approximately five kilometers east of Barks on the 4th. On the afternoon of the 5th, they destroyed two enemy rapid-firing guns and three armored vehicles and ammunition trucks each.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Characteristics of the New Japanese Cabinet <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - In light of the increasingly pressing situation, the Allied Prime Minister Koiso decided to give way to a more powerful cabinet to cope with all eventualities, and Suzuki, an admiral of the navy, was quickly appointed. He has completed the task of forming a cabinet and has emerged in a new form amidst the tense autumn weather of the world. All countries in the world attach great importance to the Suzuki Cabinet, especially the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, who have higher expectations. The general feeling about this cabinet reorganization is that it is aimed at uniting the domestic forces, exerting the total strength for the decisive battle, and concentrating all efforts on increasing aircraft production to strengthen the defense of the homeland. In terms of foreign affairs, it will follow the past policies and strengthen the unity of the countries of East Asia to jointly seek the liberation of the entire East Asia.</p>
<p>The characteristics of this cabinet are twofold: It is centered on important ministers to form a more powerful cabinet, and more of the new cabinet officials are related to the navy, which is highly anticipated for the future development of the Japanese navy. Regarding the Soviet Union, it is hoped that the new cabinet will continue to advance the previous cabinet's policies. Moreover, the formation of this cabinet comes after the establishment of a new Japanese political party, and two of the new cabinet members are from the new party, so the connection between the military and the people will become closer.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The New Japanese Cabinet Implements Decisive Politics <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 8th that in the naval and air operations around Okinawa Island late on April 5th, a total of 24 auxiliary aircraft carriers, battleships, and other ships were sunk or destroyed. However, the enemy's broadcasts continue their consistent style, striving to conceal the damage suffered, only acknowledging that three destroyers were sunk. Although the US has publicized that its losses are minimal, only claiming the loss of three destroyers and seven aircraft, it has also stated that the British 35,000-ton battleship George V, which participated in the battle, suffered heavy damage from a Japanese air attack and was forced to retreat from the battle line, which shows how contradictory the enemy's propaganda is.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese air force and surface fleet in the naval and air battle around Okinawa Island have become special attack units, determined to destroy the enemy with firm fighting spirit. At this time, the Suzuki Cabinet was born after the Koiso Cabinet. The new Prime Minister Suzuki Kantaro stated in his speech: "I am determined to stand in the front line with my old body for the people of the country and handle state affairs. I hope that you will step over my corpse, embrace a brave heart, and develop new combat power to pacify the sacred heart."</p>
<p>During the last great war, French Prime Minister Clemenceau, at the age of seventy-seven, finally reversed France's decline. The 79-year-old Prime Minister Suzuki Kantaro is also determined to lead the people of the country to fight to the end. The Suzuki Cabinet, with Anami and Yonai, ministers of the army and navy, respectively, concentrates the consistency of politics and strategy to powerfully promote decisive policies. The new cabinet is strongly supported by the ministers and the faith of the people. Under this harsh war situation, General Suzuki assigned the people of the country to the decisive battle machine, issuing orders. Japan is now achieving great results around Okinawa externally, and internally, the Suzuki Cabinet is strongly promoting decisive politics. Government officials, military personnel, and civilians are all advancing toward the path of destroying the enemy with the spirit of special attacks, and we all have high expectations.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) - The opinions of Chongqing and the United States are not consistent regarding the allocation of military supplies transported via the Stilwell Road and the defense of the road. The United States seems to have a monopoly on the road, which has caused great dissatisfaction in Chongqing. According to recent enemy intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Pan Sen of the US Army Rear Services in Kunming stated that the prerequisite for the road is the increase in personnel and that the US military should have priority in the transport of military supplies via the road. The main points of his statement are as follows: Currently, the US military on the mainland needs one-third of a ton of supplies per day, and the 14th Air Force has a great need for fuel recently. The US military's supplies are inferior to those in other theaters, and sometimes only two boxes of cigarettes are allocated per month, and other recreational items are even made in China.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Re-discussing the Way Out for the Shanghai Industrial Community <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of the future of overall industrial construction, we will address the unreasonable phenomenon of China's economic bias towards several large cities. We consistently advocate for a balanced development that is suitable for the material, the location, and the people. Otherwise, there is no way to eliminate the colonial characteristics of China's economy, and there is no way to transform the socio-economy.</p>
<p>This theory and direction are equally suitable for the future industrial construction of Shanghai. Moreover, since Shanghai has always been the center of China's economy, finance, and especially industry, this fundamental reform should be initiated by the Shanghai industrial community. Secondly, considering the actual environment in Shanghai, with the progress of the war, it may be subject to air raid damage at any time. It is also difficult to improve the situation for a while due to the lack of coal, power restrictions, insufficient raw materials, and transportation obstruction. Rather than being trapped in a predicament of sitting idle and consuming resources, it is better to make active plans and seek a way out. Therefore, we have repeatedly argued that Shanghai's industry should be evacuated to the inland as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There are currently two arguments regarding the evacuation of Shanghai's industry. First, large factories should be transferred to Huaihai Province to build the future light industry foundation in the region. Second, smaller factories, especially those producing daily necessities, should be evacuated to the counties of Jiangsu Province, utilizing the local specialties of each county and adapting to the needs of the rural areas, building small factories for daily necessities. We believe that both of these arguments, whether for the construction of China's new industry after the war or for opening up a way out for Shanghai's industry and commerce today, require further research and practice. The former will not be discussed for the time being. Regarding the establishment of small factories for daily necessities in the counties of Jiangsu, we will further supplement and discuss as follows:</p>
<p>First, the evacuation of Shanghai's industrial community to the counties of Jiangsu to establish small factories for daily necessities is the industry itself seeking a way out to adapt to the environment. Therefore, the industry should automatically and quickly develop appropriate countermeasures. However, for rational development, it should be carried out in an organized, planned, and stepwise manner, trying to avoid deformed development, such as small yarn factories being established in competition due to profit. The types and number of factories to be built should be determined based on the special raw materials of each county in Jiangsu, the special needs of the rural areas, and the conditions of transportation.</p>
<p>Second, the Shanghai industrial and commercial community, especially factories with ample funds, should immediately conduct investigations and research, invest in setting up factories in various counties, or use existing local handicrafts to provide financial and technical assistance to promote development.</p>
<p>Third, the government authorities and the financial community should provide various assistance and conveniences to those in the industrial community who set up small factories for daily necessities in various counties in terms of funding, material handling, and security protection. If necessary, they should also provide rewards and subsidies. Tax exemptions and reductions should be given to the products of small factories.</p>
<p>In order to realize the evacuation of Shanghai's industry, and at the same time, to carry out planning, we suggest that the city's economic authorities, the Jiangsu Province authorities, and the leaders of various relevant trade associations of daily necessities factories, as well as economic experts, should form a committee to start investigation, design, and implementation. In addition to government loans, self-investment or loans from the financial community should be guaranteed interest by the National Bank to show the intention of advocating and assisting.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Togo Appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs; Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Suzuki intended to appoint former Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs at the beginning of his cabinet formation. However, Togo was residing in Karuizawa and was unable to arrive in Tokyo before the inauguration ceremony on the 7th. Therefore, Prime Minister Suzuki temporarily served concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs until now. Togo responded to the telegram and met with the Prime Minister after the inauguration ceremony on the 7th to negotiate his entry into the cabinet and requested a period of hesitation to carefully consider it. At 5:00 PM on the 9th, he visited the Prime Minister's official residence again for important talks. Since their opinions on the policy outline were completely consistent, he agreed to join the cabinet. The inauguration ceremony was held in the palace in the afternoon, and was announced by the Information Bureau at the same time. Togo is from Hiroshima Prefecture, 64 years old. After graduating from the University of Tokyo in Meiji 41 (1908), he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Showa 8 (1933), he served as Director of the European and American Bureau and Director of the Eurasian Bureau. He then concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. In the autumn of Showa 12 (1937), he was appointed Ambassador to Germany, and made great efforts in the cooperation between Japan and Germany. In the autumn of Showa 14 (1939), he was transferred to Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In Showa 16 (1941), he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet. He resigned and retired in September of Showa 17 (1942) and was appointed as a member of the House of Peers until today.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Current Situation in Taicang <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhu Ming)</p>
<p>There are two transportation routes between Shanghai and Taicang: one is the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, where long-distance buses can directly reach Taicang. If the car parts do not encounter any obstacles, it takes about four hours to reach the west gate of Taicang city. The long-distance bus operated by the China Central Railway, with a station on Qiujiang Road, was originally scheduled for two trips per day (9:00 AM, 2:00 PM), but in reality, there is often only one trip at 9:00 AM. If it rains, it will be suspended. Each car was originally stipulated to carry 40 passengers, but now it carries more than 50 passengers. There are many commercial car lines currently, which are more convenient than before, and the journey is safe, but the road surface is uneven and bumpy, and because the bridges are damaged, passengers need to get off and walk in the middle of the journey. If you take a car from Shanghai to Nanxiang or Jiading, you can take an inland river boat to Taicang City. This route takes longer, but it is economical.</p>
<p>If there are five or six people, and there is a little more luggage, it is more convenient to charter a car from Shanghai directly to Taicang City. The car price is about 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Taicang is similar to that in Shanghai. The prices of major daily necessities are listed below:</p>
<p>Rice (stone) 70,000 yuan</p>
<p>Firewood (load) 3,000 yuan</p>
<p>Oil (catty) 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Meat (catty) 800 yuan</p>
<p>Spinach (catty) 330 yuan</p>
<p>Electricity Per Kilowatt 500 yuan</p>
<p>The local rice and grain can be self-sufficient. Now, due to the influence of rice dealers, the stored rice can only last until mid-April. Now, to buy three or four dou at a time, you must go to the west gate or several miles outside the north gate. It is said that the farther away from the north gate, the lower the price.</p>
<p>There are currently 25,000 residents in Taicang City. The market is better in the west gate. The rent in the city is calculated in rice. An ordinary room 16 feet wide and 16 feet long costs 1.5 dou of rice per month, or about 10,000 yuan. This system has been banned by the county government, but many still follow it secretly.</p>
<p>Those who maintain law and order include the Military Police, the Garrison Team, the Security Team, and the Public Security Bureau. In general, the situation is good. There are two senior high schools, four junior high schools, and three elementary schools in the city. Not many school-age children are enrolled, and education is not very developed.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The Special Court for the Anhui Civil Servant Extortion Case Has Delivered Its Verdict; Yu Shi'an Sentenced to Life Imprisonment <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Yu Shi'an, the former Chief Secretary of the Third District Administrative Inspectorate of Anhui, along with Wang Shuzhi, the inspector, Liu Junyang, the councilor, and Liu Daoya, the head of the Mingguangzhen District of Jiashan County, conspired with Zhou Leshan, the former Administrative Inspector of the Third District, at the end of November last year to extort donations from various industries in Mingguang in the name of dedication. The total amount of money obtained reached 14.16 million yuan. Zhou, Yu, and Liu decided to submit 5.2 million yuan, and intended to embezzle the remaining 8.96 million yuan. This was discovered by the Anhui Provincial Government, which ordered Councilor Ge Wanglong to investigate. The suspect Liu Junyang and others then requested that various industries conceal the matter on their behalf. After Councilor Ge met with the chairmen of various industries, he learned that the above-mentioned facts were true, and believed that Yu Shi'an and others had illegally extorted a huge sum of money and concealed the report, which was inappropriate. He immediately escorted the one thousand suspects to Bengbu to be interrogated by the Provincial Government. Inspector Zhou Leshan had committed suicide by taking poison for fear of punishment. The remaining defendants were sent to the Special Court. After several trials, a verdict was issued on the 3rd of this month, sentencing Yu Shi'an to life imprisonment for forcibly extorting property from the people, and fining him 50,000 yuan. Wang Shuzhi was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and fined 30,000 yuan. Liu Daoya was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and fined 20,000 yuan. Liu Junyang was acquitted.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency reports: The past week has been one of the most tense weeks of the Western Front. Famous cities such as Bremen, Hanover, Ofrat, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart are all close to the battle line, and the resistance of the German troops at each point is gradually showing results. At present, the battle line from the far north to the far south stretches from Anтинg eastward, then turns northwest, passing through Almelo, Minden, Nothausen, and reaching the heart of Germany, then turning westward to the southwest, passing through Eisenach, Schweinfurt, Wurzburg, Heilbronn, and reaching Karlsruhe in a semi-circle. At present, the frontline in the east, from Berlin to Frankfurt, Kustrin, etc., is only 60 kilometers away, but in the past week, it has not been able to affect the resistance of the western front at all. The situation on the northernmost wing of the Western Front is extremely noteworthy. The Weser district is tense, and Bremen, one of Germany's most important seaports, is under threat, but strong German forces have withdrawn from the Netherlands and are stationed in the area west of Bremen.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuter reports: U.S. Army Commander General Stilwell stated at an Army Memorial Day dinner the night before that as American forces advance closer to the Japanese mainland, the supply lines for the Allied forces increase in length, while the Japanese supply lines shorten. This point cannot be ignored. Supplying the troops fighting in Europe requires a 3,000-mile voyage across the Atlantic, while supplying the troops fighting in East Asia requires a 7,000-mile voyage across the Pacific. The eastern United States has many good ports, while the western United States has fewer. This point also cannot be ignored. From the good ports of the Philippines to the Asian mainland is still a 600-mile voyage, while the English Channel is only twenty-six miles wide. The difference in difficulty is obvious. Furthermore, the military strength of the Japanese in this theater is even stronger than the military strength the American forces have encountered elsewhere.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuter reports: The battle for Vienna is gradually becoming a large-scale battle. The fighting on the German-Hungarian border, as well as the clashes between the Morava River and the Rabnitz River, are not included in the scope of this major battle. The most important development in the battle for Vienna is the Soviet forces' penetration into the Vienna Woods, putting pressure on the German Danube bridgehead near Tulln, northwest of Vienna. Although the Soviet forces were blocked in front of the German defense line, they simultaneously pushed around Vienna from the west. The fierce fighting continued all day. Although the Suedbahnhof (South Station) and Margaretenring in Vienna have been recaptured by German forces, the Westbahnhof district (West Station) is in danger of being penetrated by Soviet forces.</p>

<h3 id="e25">All Sectors Should Restrain Themselves, Cooperate in Suppressing Prices - Top Economic Advisor Ogura Delivers Remarks <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Government's top economic advisor, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, made a special trip from Nanking for official business. Yesterday (9th) at 4:00 PM, he met with local Chinese and foreign reporters at the East Asia Building along with the new economic advisor, Mr. Araki. Top Advisor Ogura delivered remarks on issues such as the mobilization of Chinese resources for war efforts and the suppression of prices. He also answered many questions raised by reporters. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Ogura Advisor Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Front Lines and the Rear Are Equally Important <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The original remarks from Top Advisor Ogura: (Long time no see, everyone. The situation has progressed rapidly recently; things that happened only two or three months ago feel like a long time ago. Now that the enemy has climbed onto the Philippines, seized Iwo Jima, and landed on part of Okinawa, and as the bombing of important cities, both inside and outside, intensifies, the front lines and the rear must be regarded as equally important. Whether in the homeland or on-site, the posture directly connected to the war effort is quickly being established, which is only natural. At this time, we must sincerely face the situation and implement decisive measures, regardless of formalities or past malpractices, in order to prepare for any situation that may arise in the future, which goes without saying. Economic matters must never lag behind the war effort. Therefore, the military and civilians of both Japan and China must work even more closely together, and with a new resolve, continue to advance to complete the holy war.)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Chinese Resources Should Be Mobilized for War Efforts <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>I believe that China is now the largest supply base among the regions of Greater East Asia for Japan. However, in view of the development of the war situation, all sectors must redouble their efforts to strategically mobilize Chinese resources. Regarding the problems in Central China, the problem of [text unclear - looks like "wheat" related characters] is actually the central issue. Because the achievements in [same unclear text] are not only directly related to war efforts, but also have a great impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, I urge local officials and civilians to work even harder. Although the [same unclear text] problem is also important, problems such as transportation or the revitalization of light industry are easy to talk about, but actually doing them well is very difficult. All parties are working hard on this issue, but it seems that some aspects of the situation are gradually deteriorating. However, the enemy is also experiencing this phenomenon, so we must continue to work hard to the end and never change our course. At present, we should be satisfied with any improvement, no matter how small, that we can make in the worsening war situation. But if we continue to work hard, we will definitely be able to improve, and our efforts will be worthwhile.</p>
<h3 id="e28">The Development of the War Situation is in Our Favor <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The enemy firmly believes that victory in this war will belong to them. The closer the enemy gets to the Japanese mainland, the longer their supply lines become, and the more the war situation seems to slowly unfold in our favor, revealing the enemy's anxiety. Of course, the war situation will become increasingly tragic and harsh in the future. The enemy thinks that if we keep fighting persistently, the enemy will naturally retreat. Today, enduring hardship is the path that all East Asian nations should take. It is not possible to win the crown of victory without effort. In other words, no one can stand idly by. I believe that the people of China and Japan should take advantage of the present opportunity to make further progress, and make a greater contribution to the great cause of Asia, so as not to be ashamed. If this spirit can be thoroughly implemented, then prices can also be favorably affected. I believe that the reasons for the recent high prices in Central China are very complex, as described below:</p>
<h3 id="e29">Reasons for High Prices in Central China <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>China is very different from other warring nations. Even though it still possesses abundant resources, it cannot circulate them smoothly, making it a target for speculation and hoarding, which is an important reason for high prices. In view of this, I believe that if the atmosphere of self-restraint and the elimination of speculation and hoarding can permeate the economic sphere and gradually extend to other aspects, good results will definitely be shown. As you all know, observing the current price trends in Central China is regrettable, whether from the perspective of squeezing resources for war economics or from the perspective of people's livelihood. At present, the authorities in China and Japan are promoting policies to suppress prices with great enthusiasm. However, I also believe that promoting self-restraint in all sectors is an important part of suppressing prices and safeguarding currency measures.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Answering Questions <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Advisor Ogura stated: At this critical moment in the Greater East Asia War, all nations of Greater East Asia should cooperate closely in this difficult time, actively uniting as one. Whether it is economic policy or any policy, it will definitely have a bright future of advancement if it is tightly connected and coordinated. Now the national government is actively strengthening production, and all sectors should have a thorough understanding of this in order to achieve final victory. He then answered the various questions raised:</p>
<p>1. Regarding the problem of rationing for civilian needs. (Answer) Due to production and resource constraints, it is still not possible to achieve universal rationing. In the future, we should increase production, and rely on the cooperation of all farmers and sincerely trust the implementation of control measures.</p>
<p>2. What methods are there to bring back the flow of cash to outside ports? (Answer) At present, after receiving goods, cash tends to flow into rural areas. I hope that farmers will acquire the virtue of accumulating savings and depositing them in local banks, in order to emulate the inherent spirit of the Japanese people. This will allow currency to flow smoothly back.</p>
<p>3. What are your opinions on replenishing material supply and increasing production? (Answer) In addition to replenishing the source of coal and increasing the ability to transport it, we should also actively develop local coal resources. Regarding coal, we have already received the joint cooperation of the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. There should be no shortage of coal mining. There should be no problems with increasing production in the future.</p>
<p>4. What is the economic policy of the new Japanese cabinet towards China? (Answer) After the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan, the policy towards China will continue to follow the established direction of the past and will continue to be implemented without any change.</p>
<p>5. What are your opinions on strengthening wartime economic control measures? (Answer) During wartime economics and control, the focus should be on mobilizing war efforts, increasing military production and civilian supplies.</p>
<p>6. What are the new economic policies of China? (Answer) The national government already has a basic concept for these policies and is actively engaged in increasing production. At the same time, all provinces and cities have followed orders to expand village production work. Anhui and Huai provinces have recently been training basic rural talent to strengthen rural production.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Yesterday, Each District Conducted Routine Air Defense Drills - The Initial Drill Used Gongs to Transmit Alerts <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>

At the same time, other districts designated appropriate locations to carry out various comprehensive drills, inspected air defense equipment, and reorganized air defense teams. Factories in each district also had personnel from their respective police sub-bureaus directing training on various necessary measures.</p>

Now that there is this opportunity, some of the [unclear] children can go back to school and get an education, but some, due to limited enrollment, were disappointed and went back. Therefore, we feel even more fortunate and should do more to help obligatory elementary schools so that they can be opened more widely and on a larger scale. If our compatriots all have rich knowledge and skills, excellent character, and strong bodies, then our China will definitely be built into an orderly and prosperous country. The students quickly decided to save as much money as possible during the spring break and donate it to the obligatory elementary schools, and also donate the books they had read. The total amount was 23,250 yuan and 720 books. We hope that all the students in Shanghai can do their part so that the obligatory elementary schools can definitely be developed; perhaps in the near future, countless obligatory middle schools and even obligatory universities will be established everywhere.)</p>
