<p>日本軍民苦倝精神</p>
<p>東京十日中央計電　頃有從軍記者戶國氏，自前綫歸來，據發表感想稱：歸國第一個感想，爲祖國日本戰災戰禍，旣未如在外地時所想像之甚，國民士氣更精神百倍毫無消沉之象，尤其國內交通運輸機關，雖有敵機濫炸都市，仍遝用十分圓滿，誠出人意料之外。目前陸上交通尚無問題，敵人奸詐六大都市後，最近又改作中小　市之　　調轟炸，連日以B29機作濃密之燒夷彈轟炸，世似尙未達到破壞交通綫之程度。因最近數目來之攻襲，山陽，東海道兩鐵道　段沿綫各都市，均受敵　投彈之洗禮，由車窗眺望神尸·大阪·名古屋·並京　地帶（東京至橫濱間）各都市，滿目擔頻，遍地瓦　，確係事實。然東京等都市戰災難軍，一般民衆均能洛守　位，維持原有工作，迄未稍遲，都市人口並未由多大之減少，復典工作已在逐漸進行中。據聞都市之罹災者均准免費利用交通穢關，不必要之市民早已疏散，留居者山當局配給較平素更多之食糧等，敵從未見因戰災而發生混亂情形。轟炸之跡象極烈，因此喪家之人數當甚衆，但彼螢不從事感傷，反極樂天，一若犧牲不足畏者。予於由下關駛往東京之列軍中，乘客絕無一人語及戰局，或談到戰災之痛苦者，彼軍面容均甚緊張，但決不露復然之色，度彼革胸中認為徒事戰論，無裨實際，母　各人負起所當做之責任，能於今日實踐之者即完成之爲愈也，蓋惟此始爲走向勝利之途。據傳此次東京都內，即於難災之廢墟中，種植甘　，以大量收獲爲目標云。都內各地現菜圃觸目皆是，一切指導計劃，均離去紙上空談而賓地去幹，任何事均力行不息此即爲以祖國爲戰塲之國民態度也。</p>

<h3 id="c6">渝蘇問題的觀測 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>關於宋子文訪問莫斯科的內幕，本報曾指出其三項任務，即：　渝蘇關係調整，　渝延關係的折衝，　中日問題意見之交換。我們並曾特別指出，宋此行特別可注目的一點，是在柏林三頭會議以前，他的訪蘇，不僅是重慶一方面外交新活動，背後還有英美的意旨，隱約可見。不過，道些問題的複雜性，決不能輕易獲得成功。現在宋到莫斯科已有十一天，和史太林會談也有三次，和莫洛托夫及共他方面也有變次接觸，照目前所能看到的消息而論，除了證明我們上述觀測尙未遠　事實之外，我們認爲尙有以下幾點，値得研究。</p>
<p>第一，關於國共問題，可說是現代中國政洽問題之痛，過去二十年是如此，今後亦難有神妙療法渴求一旦霍然。這個問題向蘇聯去求解決之法，在好弄小聰明的政治家也許認為是釜底抽薪之法，所謂解鈴還須繫鈴人，但是問題倒還在中共所不滿於渝政權的現狀，假如渝政權不滿足中其的耍求，而希望蘇聯對延安壓迫一下，這是一種不値一笑的妄想，蘇聯　可冠免堂皇地說，這是貴國的內政問題。自己的問題，速是要自己解決，第三者勢力買炎培氏等之赴延安，也許就是爲此吧？</p>
<p>第二，關於渝蘇關係，重變百六全大會通過加强對蘇外交政策決議案後，多年未獲成行的中國國民蘇聯訪問團傳已出發，第二步即爲宋子文之赴蘇。但是重慶的外交政策，說老實話，只是美國外交政策的一部分而已，在蔣以下一部分實力派，未嘗不想將來能在蘇美之間獲得居中獨立的地位，英國則顯然不要重慶爲美蘇間的緩衝風，但望以重慶外交部爲其一國務院的支部。在這種矛盾之下，實予蘇聯以可乘的機會。所以這次對宋態度，可說是有點傲然。談邊臨問題吧，他演一套歡迎蒙古人民共和國總理的外交劇，其儀式與歡宴，一如對宋一行者，簡直可說向宋示成。說新　問題吧，和重慶的整個西北開發計劃有關，但蘇聯見肯在改善蘇渝關係意義下替英美白白服務？過去以西方戰事吃緊而對新疆讓步，這次情形可不同了。</p>
<p>第三，說到對整個遠東問題，重變痴心夢想的無非是蘇聯出來干涉中日戰事，蘇聯對日施用壓力，另一方面，英美又何嘗不有拖蘇聯下火綫的謀略呢？誠然，今日誇大英美蘇渝間的矛盾是錯誤的，但同時，說蘇聯因爲西綫無戰事而立刻將謀有事於遠東，也是毫無根據的。所以，要蘇聯轉實現有的態度，英美重慶能出什麼代價呢？新疆·蒙古·滿洲·朝鮮·阿拉斯加勢力範圍的承認，中國聯合政府的成立，這一切是今日英美重慶所能辦得到的嗎？</p>
<p>宋子文對於有俗這樣複雜關係的渝蘇關係，輕於出征，其能帶得多少禮品回來，　來是不卜可知了。也許，在蕪可奈何中，還謀等待三頭會議的最後解決吧？所以，我們可能推測，宋與史太林的三頭會晤，還只止於交換意見，最大的金圖，也不過能對三頭會議有提出建議的機會。但是，三頭會議的舉行已近）於眉睫，謎底是會立刻揭曉了。</p>

<p>大陸基地十日中央社電敵機對華中方面，曾連日分數次反覆執拗來襲。緣本年一月中，敵以艦載機來襲香港廣州地區時，其前會於去年十二月中旬以B29型機五六十架大規模來襲，此外則以單機或少數機　續轟炸。敵機最近行動特點如次：　轟炸目標不確定，　定期來襲，且經過路線不同，　出動基地殆全為菲島方面，　向前綫將兵散布傳單，　夜間當作長時間低空廻旋。由此等情形推測，敵似爲價察氣象並訓練熟練者，日期以神經戰術攻擊日軍，揚言其一貫之戰略轟炸，乃最近敵機對大陸轟炸之特點。</p>

<p>渝總反攻準備　內幕一斑</p>
<p>大陸基地十日中央社電去春日軍展開河南作戰後，受致命打擊之渝軍，即於河南·山東·安徽·江蘇省境，新設第十戰區，同時竭力建設各戰區，企圖對日反攻，積極將軍隊成爲美式裝備。一方面延安勢力，乘日軍大陸作戰之間隙，企圖擴大地盤，開始南下。又渝方之唯一補給路綫斯蒂威爾公路，運輸量之缺乏，雖經重慶積極努力，仍無顯著效果”其對日總反攻態勞，迄今尚未脫準備時期。關於此點，日前渝方陸空軍參謀總長何應欽稱，謹以渝方之華事力，欲與大陸之日軍擾　，實非容易，率直承認日軍戰力之強大。並謂渝軍為期以目力發動總反攻，今後必須積極增强軍器，並需要相當之時間。雖然我人對於渝方之戰爭能力，須有深切之認識，渝方自喪失柳桂地區以來，曾起用於河南作戰失利之湯恩伯，爲黔桂湘邊區總司令。去秋於貴陽設立司令部，擁有三十師兵力，又設中國陸空軍總司令部於昆明，以何應欽爲總司令，統轄緬甸遠征軍·桂湘邊區軍。　越邊區軍。第四戰區軍等雄厚兵力。由此等事實觀之，可知渝方對日總反攻之焦點，顯在西南中國，惟渝方雖如此努力，但因援渝物資不足，影響總反攻之準備至大。現美國之援渝補給路，依賴喜馬拉亞之空中運輸，與斯蒂威爾公路之陸上運輸，及印度通來之　沚管，但全部月僅七萬五千噸內外而已，其中半數爲駐渝美軍領用，故渝方雖宣稱西南總反攻，但仍木大規模發動，原因亦在於此。又其他一主因，則可謂為延安勢力之南進，按延安自為將遂出瑞金以來，壓時已久，現正以瑞金　為目標而南下，此點渝方決不能漠視，因此渝方不得不以一部勢力應付延安。此種講勢現已運展至湖南江西廣西福建方面之渝延武力衝突。六月二十三日合衆社之洛杉磯消息，曾引海拉爾通報之社評，力言應防止渝延之武力衝突，然延安軍以湖南江西省境附近之平江爲中心，集結兵力一萬五千名，蘇浙軍區之第一第二縱隊，現已由長江下游之三角地帶，擴大至福建省，又廣東省方面之東江縱隊及珠江中隊，亦沿海岸綫向東北及西南前進，各地與渝軍演成正面衝突。如此渝方之對日總反攻，其內心須驅逐延安勢力，及感驅渝美軍之專種，故七月七日之參政會中，蔣介石曾官稱，「欲在中國戰域擊破日軍之大業，必須由我人手中自身行之」，此言殊足令人深長思之。</p>

<p>— 藍彧</p>
<p>上南道上</p>
<p>於六月二十九日淸晨，記者一有驅車至南碼頭，買舟渡江。舟狹小，可容六七人，先在礪頭購囂一根，價一千元；到周家渡時正九點鐘，時上南鐵路車站候軍旅客，排列已如長蛇，及至登車，以車少客多，早無座位，站立者亦苦無插足之地，擁擠情狀，不亞於京滬火車。抵燭浦十一點一刻。周浦爲上南路終點，沿途經過新馬路，楊思橋，三林塘，天花庵，百　，而至周浦，計七站，車行一小時許。聞數年前車行甚速，現因車輛機件陣舊，路軌欠平，頗簸較甚，駛行逐較昔緩慢。</p>
<p>交通一斑</p>
<p>按周浦爲南滙絲首鎭，即在整個補東，亦爲數一數二之大鎭。全區周圍約三四里，街道縱橫，屋宇論比，但街道狹窄，黃包車亦難通行。早午有菜市及種市，人口分怖，據當地鎭公所調查，計六十三保，二百四十八甲，二千六百九十六戶，合計男女一萬一千六百五十人。惟據記者觀察，恐不止此數，詢當地當老，亦云至少在一倍以上。</p>
<p>交通方面，除上南路以外，有通南滙及大團之公路，平時有公共汽車往來其間，嗣囚鄉區治安不良，恒有土匪及遊繫隊出沒，故早停頓，現僅有一類似公共汽車之卡車，可容十數人，時間不定，大致每日兩班，隨滿隨開，每人需價一萬五千元。此外有東亞公司之汽車，供旅客定包，至南滙車價爲十四萬元，最近漲至二十萬，七八人攤派，合計每人約二萬餘至三萬。由周浦出發，如中途不發生阻碍，四十分鐘即可抵達。水路有駛南匯及大團之航輪兩家，每日下午一項，兩輪開行時間相仿，至南滙旅費爲六千元，較汽東爲廉，然費時在四小時以上，途中亦難保安全，聞該二輸於兩個月內，曾爲遊擊隊檢查數次，幸所遇者非土匪，否則人財兩失矣。</p>
<p>米市情形</p>
<p>該地四鄉產沐，數量極少，但以水陸交通發達，兼之爲必經要通，故該鎭爲米糧集散地，構成全市商業重心。考米糧來源，多半來自率賢，金山，松江等地，在米糧統制時，米販爲求沿途穩妥起見，往往利用小舟，輾轉由小港輸運至該鎭。再由小販自行家零購，婦女挑負一二斗，男子則利用腳踏車，可運一擔餘；上南路上隨處可見運米腳踏車，絡釋於途。只要一過龍王廣對鎖綫，便等於三關俱破，以不的阻撓小事破費，即司安渡，運抵上海。在米糧未開放通行時如能全程通過，則獲利極厚，故來此零阪甚夥。</p>
<p>開禁以後</p>
<p>上海米價，由十數萬漲至近百萬時，其時當地米價，恒與上海相　二三十萬，如上海米價至九十萬時，富地爲六十萬，囚之販米者更爲踴躍，但囚產地存米不豐，一部份米商，又見米價日夜暴漲，存奇貨可居之望，紛紛收藏，以致輪運該鎮之數量，驟然減少。當地行政當局，為維持本身民盆起見，一方面無限出境，一方面將米價酌量提高，使來源通暢。自米糧緊急措置以後，當局遵照中央法令，開放通行，惟以米商量斷居奇，加以米糧准許通行，金山松江一帶，可由該地直接輸送上海，不必再行續道，故該鎭應市之米，日見減少，而一部份小販，資本較厚者，鑒於該鎮之米價，與滬相等，無利可獲，乃都往產地採講直接運滬。關於沿途情形，記者曾問詢米販數人，除在該鎮繳納千分之五的保警補助費外，所經各地，尚無其他化費，從小有畫索，爲數不多。至於上項保　補助費，係於半月內新定者，分設於該總各要道，派有專員征收，凡過往之食糧及日用品等，均須征收，食糧爲千分之五，常地米價爲六十萬，每担征收三千元，另加手續費六百元。日用品千分之十，根據商品之發票計算。</p>
<p>停業原因</p>
<p>在周浦原有米行米店，計一百三十家以上，但於六月以內，已倒閉由四十於家。記者詢一米行老　關於停業原因，據謂因供應費太重，一家普通米號，須貧據百萬之上，但據記者探悉：這停業的四十家米行米店中，有一半仍做着關門生意，表面以停業爲藉口，免繳各項捐稅，丙里找幾個有勢力者撑腰，幹着國積居奇待價而沽的勾當；只有幾個資金短絀的米行，在一度米價瘋狂時，售出之米，未能抵購進之數，又苦於供應費吿大，不得已而停業了。</p>
<p>現鈔恐慌</p>
<p>上海圍着現鈔恐慌，發生撥款單流弊，在周浦也有同樣情形，而且比上海尤烈。當地有銀行錢莊三十餘家，君三十餘家，不管費本大小，均發行撥款單，並且發行數字，甚至超過資本額數倍。這班投機取巧的余融業，一面吸收現鈔，暗中點現，一面特任意開出撥款單，廣收米糧及日用商品，因之市上撥款單充斥，幾乎覯數千元的東西，也以撥款單行使。滬上撥款單在周浦不能通用，原因是有僞票發現，故失去信用。其實當地的撥款單，何嘗有信用可言。實在是促使經濟崩潰，擾亂金融的大敵，更是迫使物價猛漲的主因。</p>
<p>敎育衛生</p>
<p>敎員待遇待遇相當優越，並不是數千塊錢的薪永，而是按月有五斗米配給；這此，俸米，是由區公所向各界募捐得來。當地計有縣立第二中學一所，私立亞光中學一所，公私立小學五所，縣立中學的校長是有區長兼任。已於衛生事業，講得上成績的，一是友軍設立的診務所，一是純陽殿的施診給藥；此外雖尙有一輔善爲名的醫所，常常拿着軸善的冊子出外募捐，可是已不若往前的名符其賓，往往醫藥費較私人醫寓爲高。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Emergency Measures for Land Transportation: Japanese Government Decides to Implement, Aims for Complete Preparation for Mainland Decisive Battle <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In response to the inevitable battlefield situation on the mainland, the Japanese Ministry of Transportation, in the cabinet meeting on the 29th of last month, decided on "Emergency Measures for Transportation in Case of Domestic Battlefield," aiming to complete the transportation of food and specific weapons in the short term. At the same time, it will actively promote the evacuation of factories, aiming for complete preparation for the mainland decisive battle. It has now decided on the specific plan for the army, "Implementation Guidelines for Mainland Decisive Battle Transportation," to be vigorously implemented in the next two months regarding national railways, local railways, transportation, and all other aspects of land transportation. Furthermore, to promote implementation and coordination, it was decided to establish a Promotion Headquarters in the ministry and Promotion Branches in each railway bureau. At the same time, a Promotion Team organized by experts from the ministry will be dispatched to each area to promote the work. Given that the success or failure of these implementation guidelines has a significant impact on Japan's mainland decisive battle capability, the Ministry of Transportation hopes for the utmost cooperation from all army employees and related parties.</p>
<h3 id="e2">800 Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Attack Kanto Region; Kinki and Shikoku Also Raided <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 10th: Carrier-based aircraft departing from enemy mobile units this morning have attacked various Japanese air bases in the Kanto region multiple times. As of 1:00 PM, the total number of enemy aircraft that attacked is estimated to be 800.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The American mobile unit suffered a major blow in the Okinawa campaign, losing half of its basic naval strength of aircraft carriers. Recently, it has been actively reorganized and has roughly restored its original state. On the morning of the 10th, it again attacked the Kanto region with carrier-based aircraft. From around 5:10 AM to 1:00 PM, a total of approximately 800 enemy carrier-based aircraft bombed Japanese air bases in the Kanto region multiple times, and some even strafed urban areas. Judging from the enemy's sortie situation this time, the enemy's aircraft carriers probably include those that were damaged in the battles of the Philippines and Okinawa and have been repaired, as well as several mobilized commissioned aircraft carriers. Its strength is roughly a mobile unit based on more than ten aircraft carriers. Therefore, it is expected that carrier-based fighters will continue to come in the air in the next few days.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – A United Press report from Guam states: The powerful aircraft carrier mobile unit of Halsey's Third Fleet has now been deployed in the Pacific, under the command of Lieutenant General Marc Mitscher.</p>
<p>Osaka, 10th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Approximately 100 P-51 enemy aircraft from a southern base attacked the Kinki region in three groups from around 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM on the 10th, attacking military facilities and ships near Osaka and Kobe. Details of damage inflicted are omitted.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 70 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked Sendai City with incendiary bombs at midnight today, continuing for two hours. Consequently, fires broke out in various parts of the city. However, thanks to the enthusiastic rescue efforts of the citizens, they were completely extinguished by around 5:00 AM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – 280 enemy B-29 aircraft from a southern base, formed into five groups from 9:00 PM on the 9th, dispersed and invaded mainland Japan, attacking Wakayama City, Sakai City, the southern part of Osaka City, and Kochi City with incendiary bombs for as long as five hours. Consequently, fires broke out in Wakayama City and Sakai City, but they were soon extinguished. According to the Central Military District Headquarters, which announced at 10:00 AM on the 10th, the Japanese side had confirmed the results of the battle up to 4:00 AM that morning, accounting for the destruction of seven enemy aircraft and severe damage to thirty-five aircraft. It is hoped that this result will increase.</p>
<p>Nagoya, 10th (Central News Agency) – At around 9:30 PM on the 9th, approximately 120 B-29 aircraft invaded the mainland in formations of about twenty aircraft each. Among them, forty aircraft attacked the vicinity of Yokkaichi, and the main force of seventy aircraft attacked the Gifu City area with incendiary bombs. The remaining enemy aircraft dropped naval mines near Toyama. All enemy aircraft escaped south around 0:00 AM on the 10th. Consequently, fires broke out in Gifu City and Yokkaichi, but they were all extinguished by around 5:00 AM on the same morning.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Prince Takamatsu Inspects War-Damaged Areas <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since assuming the presidency of the War Disaster Relief Association, His Highness Prince Takamatsu has been enthusiastically handling affairs and is extremely concerned about war victims. At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, he left the palace with his princess and related personnel to inspect the war disaster relief situation in various parts of Tokyo and the conditions of war-damaged vegetable gardens, and to encourage the war victims.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers and Civilians' Hardworking Spirit</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tokoku, a war correspondent who recently returned from the front lines, stated in his published impressions: His first impression upon returning to his home country was that the war damage and disaster in Japan were not as severe as he had imagined while abroad. The morale of the people was a hundred times higher, with no signs of depression. In particular, the domestic transportation system, despite enemy indiscriminate bombing of cities, was still operating very smoothly, which was beyond his expectations. Currently, there are no problems with land transportation. After the enemy's treacherous attacks on the six major cities, they have recently changed to bombing small and medium-sized cities, with B-29 aircraft carrying out dense incendiary bombing every day. However, it seems that the extent of damage has not yet reached the point of disrupting transportation lines. Because of the recent attacks, the cities along the Sanyo and Tokaido railway lines have been subjected to the enemy's bombing. From the train windows, the devastation in cities such as Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and the Kyoto area (between Tokyo and Yokohama) is a definite fact. However, in cities such as Tokyo, which have suffered from war disasters, the general public has been able to maintain their positions and continue their original work without delay. The urban population has not decreased by a large amount, and reconstruction work is gradually underway. It is heard that victims of disasters in the cities are allowed to use transportation facilities for free, and unnecessary citizens have already been evacuated. Residents who remain are provided with more food rations by the authorities than usual. The enemy has never seen confusion arising from war disasters. The signs of bombing are extremely severe, and the number of people who have lost their homes must be very large, but they do not engage in sentimentality and are extremely optimistic, as if sacrifice is not to be feared. On the train from Shimonoseki to Tokyo, not a single passenger spoke about the war situation or the pain of war disasters. Their faces were very tense, but they never revealed a sense of defeat. They probably believe in their hearts that idle war talk is of no practical use, and that each person should fulfill their responsibilities. What can be done today should be completed, for only in this way can we move towards victory. It is said that in Tokyo, even in the ruins of disasters, sweet potatoes are being planted with the goal of a large harvest. Vegetable gardens are now visible everywhere in the city. All guidance and planning are moving away from empty talk on paper and going to the ground to work. Anything is being done tirelessly. This is the attitude of a people who consider their homeland as a battlefield.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Observations on the Chongqing-Soviet Problem <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the inside story of Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow, this newspaper has pointed out his three tasks, namely: 1. Adjustment of Chongqing-Soviet relations; 2. Mediation of Chongqing-Yan'an relations; 3. Exchange of opinions on the Sino-Japanese problem. We have also specifically pointed out that one particularly noteworthy point of Song's trip is that his visit to the Soviet Union before the Berlin Three-Power Conference is not only a new diplomatic activity on the part of Chongqing, but also has the implied intention of Britain and the United States behind it. However, the complexity of these issues cannot be easily achieved. Now that Song has been in Moscow for eleven days and has met with Stalin three times, and has also had variable contacts with Molotov and other parties, based on the news that can be seen so far, in addition to proving that our above observations are not far off from the facts, we believe that there are several points worth studying.</p>
<p>First, the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can be said to be the pain of modern Chinese political issues. This was the case in the past twenty years, and it will be difficult to have a miraculous cure in the future. To seek a solution to this problem from the Soviet Union, perhaps some politicians who like to play clever tricks think it is a fundamental solution, the so-called "he who tied the bell must untie it," but the problem still lies in the fact that the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the current situation of the Chongqing government. If the Chongqing government does not meet the demands of the Communist Party and hopes that the Soviet Union will put pressure on Yan'an, this is a ridiculous fantasy. The Soviet Union can grandly say that this is your country's internal affair. One's own problems must be solved by oneself. Perhaps the visit to Yan'an by Mr. Huang Yanpei and others is for this purpose?</p>
<p>Second, regarding Chongqing-Soviet relations, after the Chongqing Sixth Plenary Session passed a resolution to strengthen its diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union, the Chinese Kuomintang Soviet Union visit group, which had not been successfully organized for many years, was reported to have departed, and the second step was Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union. But to be honest, Chongqing's foreign policy is only a part of American foreign policy. A part of the powerful faction below Chiang Kai-shek has never wanted to gain an independent position between the Soviet Union and the United States in the future. Britain obviously does not want Chongqing to be a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union, but hopes to treat Chongqing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a branch of its own State Department. Under this contradiction, it actually gives the Soviet Union an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, this time the attitude towards Song can be said to be a bit arrogant. Speaking of the issue of the border, he staged a diplomatic drama to welcome the Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the ceremony and banquet were the same as for Song's entourage, which can be simply said to be a demonstration to Song. Speaking of the Xinjiang issue, it is related to Chongqing's entire Northwest Development Plan, but would the Soviet Union be willing to provide free services to Britain and the United States under the meaning of improving Soviet-Chongqing relations? In the past, it made concessions on Xinjiang because the war in the West was tight, but this time the situation is different.</p>
<p>Third, speaking of the entire Far East issue, what Chongqing is foolishly dreaming of is nothing more than the Soviet Union coming out to intervene in the Sino-Japanese War. The Soviet Union exerts pressure on Japan. On the other hand, Britain and the United States also have a strategy of dragging the Soviet Union into the front line, right? It is true that exaggerating the contradictions between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing today is a mistake, but at the same time, saying that the Soviet Union will immediately take action in the Far East because there is no war on the Western Front is also groundless. Therefore, what price can Britain, the United States, and Chongqing pay to make the Soviet Union change its current attitude? Recognition of the spheres of influence in Xinjiang, Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, and Alaska, and the establishment of a Chinese coalition government – can Britain, the United States, and Chongqing accomplish all of this today?</p>
<p>Song Ziwen is lightly setting out on an expedition for Chongqing-Soviet relations with such complex relationships. It is impossible to know how many gifts he can bring back. Perhaps, in helplessness, he is still planning to wait for the final resolution of the Three-Power Conference? Therefore, we can speculate that Song's meeting with Stalin may only be limited to exchanging opinions, and the greatest result may only be an opportunity to make suggestions to the Three-Power Conference. However, the holding of the Three-Power Conference is imminent, and the mystery will be revealed immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Army Constructs Strong Defenses in Eastern Burma; Secures the Taungoo-Mawchi Road Line <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the rainy season began in the Burma war, the Japanese army has been constructing strong defenses near Taungoo, along the road between Taungoo and Mawchi. With the arrival of new troops, morale is extremely high, causing great damage to enemy forces equipped with tanks and heavy weapons that come to attack, and bravely repelling enemy pressure. The Japanese army on the Sittang River front does not give way to the enemy forces that continue to reinforce and resupply, and even crosses the river from the mouth of the Sittang River, attempting to destroy the enemy's plan. The remaining Japanese troops are still securing the Taungoo-Mawchi Road, and are securing the eastern half of Burma from the battle lines connecting the north and south of the Sittang River. In addition, the Japanese army unit guarding the western side of this ancient city is repeatedly daring to launch close combat attacks on the enemy transportation units that rely on the road between Kanna and Kalewa for supplies, hindering the enemy's rear transportation. In addition, the Japanese army stationed near Yangon is constantly launching close combat attacks on enemy positions near Yangon, and as a result, the achievements of the Japanese army's close combat attacks are gradually increasing. From late May to late June, the cumulative combat results achieved by the Japanese army in various places are as follows: 2,879 enemy troops killed or wounded, 2 aircraft captured, 4 shot down, 24 tanks and armored vehicles destroyed, 6 artillery pieces captured or destroyed, 25 vehicles, 69 camps burned, and many other heavy and light machine guns and ammunition captured.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Enemy Aircraft Conduct Strategic Bombing of Mainland China <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Mainland China Base, 10th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft have repeatedly and persistently attacked the Central China area for several days. Since January of this year, when enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Hong Kong and Guangzhou areas, there have been large-scale attacks by 50 or 60 B-29 aircraft in mid-December of last year, and other continuous bombing by single aircraft or small groups of aircraft. The recent characteristics of enemy aircraft activity are as follows: 1. The bombing targets are not fixed; 2. They attack on a regular basis and follow different routes; 3. The bases from which they operate are almost all in the Philippine Islands; 4. They distribute leaflets to soldiers on the front lines; 5. They conduct long-term low-altitude circling at night. Judging from these circumstances, it seems that the enemy is observing the weather and training skilled personnel, using psychological warfare tactics to attack the Japanese army, and proclaiming their consistent strategic bombing, which is the characteristic of recent enemy aircraft bombing of the mainland.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army is still firmly defending its positions on Bougainville Island and many Pacific islands, deploying strong defenses and waiting for the enemy to attack.

<h3 id="e14">Ministry of Industry Reviews Company Capital Reduction <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that companies in various places have not been able to fully develop their businesses due to a lack of raw materials and restrictions on electricity and water, are actively reducing capital to alleviate the burden on the company. The Ministry of Industry, in order to prevent companies from using capital reduction to affect the rights of small and medium-sized shareholders or for other purposes, seeks greater details in the review procedures. Companies must provide detailed reasons and methods for capital reduction in the application, and prepare the required clauses and submit them according to law. In order to facilitate the review, the ministry has ordered the competent authorities in various places to continue the review of company registration cases and submit them promptly. The following are the required clauses: Articles of Association registration items, shareholder list, capital reduction business budget, property inventory, balance sheet, minutes of the shareholders' meeting, company newspaper (for more than three months), original registration certificate fee of 25 yuan, stamp tax of 40 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Central China Water, Electricity, and Railways - No Price Increases for Now <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency): Recently, there have been widespread rumors that Central China Water and Electricity and Central China Railways would increase rates for passenger and freight transport and utilities. A reporter specifically inquired with the Ministry of Construction about this, and was informed that after discussions among the companies, it was deemed that water, electricity, and transportation are closely related to the lives of the people. Any further price increases would inevitably stimulate inflation. Therefore, it was decided that water, electricity, and train ticket prices would not be increased in the short term.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency): At stations along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line operated by Central China Railways, ticket scalping and unreasonable behavior are still rampant, severely impacting legitimate passenger traffic.

<p>A Glimpse into the Internal Preparations for the Chongqing General Counteroffensive</p>
<p>Continental Base, 10th (Central News Agency): After suffering a deadly blow in the Japanese army's Henan operation last spring, the Chongqing army established the Tenth War Zone in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu. At the same time, it has been working hard to build up each war zone, attempting to launch a counteroffensive against Japan and actively equipping its troops with American-style equipment. Meanwhile, the Yan'an forces took advantage of the gaps created by the Japanese army's mainland operations to expand their territory and began moving south. Furthermore, the transport capacity of the Stilwell Road, Chongqing's only supply line, has remained insufficient despite Chongqing's active efforts. Thus, its general counteroffensive posture has not yet emerged from the preparatory period. Regarding this point, He Yingqin, the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Army and Air Force, frankly admitted that it would not be easy for the Chongqing side to confront the Japanese army on the mainland with its military strength, directly acknowledging the strength of the Japanese forces. He also stated that the Chongqing army must actively enhance its military equipment and requires considerable time before it can launch a general counteroffensive with certainty. Although we must have a deep understanding of the Chongqing side's war-making capabilities, the Chongqing side, since losing the Liuzhou-Guilin area, has re-employed Tang Enbo, who was unsuccessful in the Henan operation, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Guizhou-Guangxi-Hunan Border Region. Last autumn, it established a headquarters in Guiyang with 30 divisions of troops and set up the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army and Air Force in Kunming, with He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief, commanding the Burma Expeditionary Force, the Guizhou-Guangxi-Hunan Border Region Army, and the Vietnamese Border Region Army, among other strong forces. From these facts, we can see that the focus of the Chongqing side's general counteroffensive against Japan is clearly in southwestern China. However, despite the Chongqing side's efforts, the shortage of supplies to Chongqing has greatly affected the preparations for the general counteroffensive. Currently, the US supply route to Chongqing relies on air transport over the Himalayas, land transport via the Stilwell Road, and pipelines from India, but the total is only about 75,000 tons per month. Half of this is used by the US military stationed in Chongqing. Therefore, although the Chongqing side has declared a general counteroffensive in the southwest, it has not yet launched on a large scale, and this is one of the reasons. Another main reason can be attributed to the southward advance of the Yan'an forces. According to reports, Yan'an has been under pressure for a long time since it left Ruijin and is now heading south with Ruijin as its target. The Chongqing side cannot ignore this, so it has to deal with Yan'an with some of its forces. This situation has now spread to Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Fujian, leading to armed conflicts between Chongqing and Yan'an forces. On June 23, a Reuters report from Los Angeles cited an editorial in the Heilongjiang Daily, strongly urging the prevention of armed conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an. However, the Yan'an army has gathered 15,000 troops near Pingjiang in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, and the First and Second Columns of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Military Region have expanded from the Yangtze River Delta to Fujian Province. Furthermore, the East River Column and the Pearl River Detachment in Guangdong Province are advancing northeast and southwest along the coast, leading to direct clashes with the Chongqing army in various places. Therefore, the Chongqing side's general counteroffensive against Japan requires first expelling the Yan'an forces and addressing the dominance of the US military in Chongqing. In the Political Consultative Conference on July 7, Chiang Kai-shek officially stated, "If we want to defeat the Japanese army in the Chinese theater of war, we must do it ourselves." This statement is worth pondering deeply.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency): According to confirmed reports from Washington, US President Truman left the United States on the weekend to travel to Europe by ship. He is accompanied by the new Secretary of State Burns, as well as many military and political advisors, with whom he will hold last-minute meetings on board before the Three-Headed Conference. It is reported that the ship used by Mr. Truman can directly communicate with the White House via encrypted wireless radio. The news of the US President's departure for Europe was widely rumored in Washington over the weekend, but the White House requested that the news not be released in accordance with inspection instructions. Later, it was revealed by the well-known American news commentary expert Peter Johnson in a radio broadcast on Saturday night. However, there is no news yet about the route Mr. Truman is taking or when he will arrive in Europe. Authoritative sources say that the Three-Headed Conference has been decided to be held in the region of Chesham southwest of Berlin.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a broadcast from Chongqing Central News Agency on the 9th, Chen Cheng, the Minister of Military Affairs of the Chongqing government, made a military report at the National Political Consultative Conference on the 7th, informing all attendees of the strength and strategic trends of the Japanese army on the mainland, and also spoke about the issue of adjusting military and political agencies, emphasizing the need for a thorough reform of the Chongqing military and political system. Members of the Political Consultative Conference also raised issues such as improving the treatment of soldiers, handling assistance to families, and student soldiers, questioning the fundamental policies of the authorities, and expressing various opinions. In conclusion, Chen Cheng replied to the questions from the members of the Political Consultative Conference, "If we do not improve the lax morale within the Ministry of Military Affairs, it will be difficult to strengthen our important mission."</p>
<h3 id="e19">Huang Yanpei and Others Return to Chongqing from Yan'an <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: According to news from this city, the Chongqing National Political Consultative Conference originally planned to send seven representatives, including Chu Tsin-nien, Xi Yupeng, Huang Yanpei, Zuo Shunsheng, Leng Yu, Wang Yunwu, and Zhang Bojun, to visit Yan'an. Later, Wang Yunwu was unable to go due to illness, so only six people went. They arrived in Yan'an on the 2nd of this month and returned to Chongqing on the 5th, staying in Yan'an for only three days. They received a warm reception from the Communist Party. The delegation made it clear that their purpose was not authorized by the Chongqing National Government, but rather to discuss the current situation with the Communist Party and to hope that the country could unite. The Communist Party expressed its support for national unity, but put forward conditions for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, urging the Kuomintang to realize the need to abandon one-party dictatorship, convene a conference of all parties and factions, organize a coalition government, and implement democratic politics. The two sides exchanged opinions, but no concrete decisions were made. It is said that the purpose of the representatives of the National Political Consultative Conference going to Yan'an this time was to act on Chiang Kai-shek's opinions, hoping that the Communist Party would send representatives to attend the Political Consultative Conference held in Chongqing on July 7. As a result, due to differing views, no compromise could be reached, so this trip by the representatives can be said to have achieved nothing. When the representatives arrived in Yan'an, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai of the Communist Party expressed a warm welcome on the surface. However, as a result, on July 7, the Communist Party issued slogans opposing the Kuomintang's oppression of the Mongolian and Hui peoples, demanding that the Kuomintang abolish economic controls, and establish a coalition government.</p>
<h3 id="e20">French Cabinet Discusses Political Reform <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 10th (Central News Agency): According to reports from Paris, France will adopt a "national referendum" system to elect a National Assembly, and the National Assembly will submit the new constitution it drafts for review. This news was released yesterday after the conclusion of a special cabinet meeting that discussed the political reforms proposed by De Gaulle. The meeting lasted six hours, the longest meeting in the French cabinet. The Resistance faction and the Left-wing parties advocated the establishment of a "unicameral" parliament, while the Radical Party advocated a "bicameral" system. It is said that De Gaulle agreed with the Radical Party's proposal, but according to news from the newspaper Le Monde, De Gaulle is close to supporting the "unicameral" proposal. The Radical Party is now strongly insisting on "revising the existing constitution," while the Left-wing parties and the Resistance faction advocate "drafting a new constitution."</p>

<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency): According to a report from a Reuters correspondent in Kiel, the "no fraternization" ban between British and German military personnel and civilians is gradually being relaxed, or may be lifted altogether. In the Guildford area, coffee shops on Sunday evenings are full of British soldiers and German men and women. Sometimes, British soldiers sit next to German women, offering them drinks and cigarettes in a very friendly manner. Even when British military police enter, they do not interfere.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Central Reserve Bank Intensifies Inspections of Banks and Firms; Must Comply with New Regulations Set by Authorities <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the financial situation and correct malpractices by financial institutions, the Central Reserve Bank has cancelled the issuance of appropriation orders across the board from the 3rd of this month. Payments to customers by banks and firms must be made with cash or crossed immediate promissory notes. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank stipulates that cash withdrawals by banks and firms are based on the total amount of their deposits, with the supply ratio increased. The cash obtained by each bank and firm must be used to pay customers as much as possible and must not be retained. It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank Inspection Department has been ordered to intensify inspections of banks and firms to determine whether they are complying with the new regulations set by the authorities and whether they have other illegal operations.</p>
<p>Issue of Time for Receiving and Paying Bills</p>
<p>Banks and money houses in this city accept bills from depositors for same-day clearing. Businesses in the central district can account for bills received before a certain time on the same day. However, recently, some businesses account for crossed bills or bills received by banks from money houses or vice versa, even if they are received before the time limit, on the next day, which is very disadvantageous for commercial enterprises. A reporter inquired about this matter with financial circles and learned that accounting for bills on the same day is possible with manpower. Accounting for them on the next day is a last resort for banks and money houses. The main reason is purely that businesses receive and pay too many bills, and the procedures and time are insufficient. Before the system of bill exchange and payment can be completely satisfactory, customers can only hope for understanding regarding whether their bills are accounted for on the same day or the next day.</p>
<p>Four Civil Servants Indicted for Dereliction of Duty and Corruption; Yesterday Remanded to Special Court; Two Policemen and Two Bureau of Finance Employees</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has strictly investigated and reported on illegal civil servants guilty of dereliction of duty and corruption, and has already transferred several cases to the Shanghai branch of the Special Court for handling in accordance with the law.

All two cases were found to be true after investigation by the Investigation Department. The former two are charged under Article 4 of the Regulations on Punishing Civil Servants for Banditry, while the latter are charged with fraud under Article 33 of the Criminal Law. The bureau submitted a request to the municipal government, which was forwarded to Chairman Chen Dai of the National Government for approval, to refer the cases to the Shanghai branch of the Special Court for trial. The bureau, after receiving the order, transferred the four offenders to the Shanghai branch of the Special Court for trial yesterday.</p>

Therefore, it was decided to confiscate them in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Methods of Raising Funds for Scholarships; Hoping for Enthusiastic People <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Any undertaking, in order to advance smoothly and achieve complete success, must first have a purpose, a plan, a goal, and a belief, and proceed step by step. There is no reason why things cannot be accomplished. The goal of our organization's ninth scholarship fund has been set at 30,000 yuan. Although the number seems large, it is still not enough for the thousands of children who need it. Moreover, raising this amount of money is indeed not easy! The method of fundraising is, one, to ask powerful people to generously donate; two, to hope that enthusiastic people, assisted graduates, assisted students, and non-assisted students will jointly promote and consistently fundraise, which will always be effective.</p>
<p>It is hoped that enthusiastic people will, with the same spirit as in the past, contribute effort and money to our newspaper's scholarship fundraising efforts. Some may not be able to recognize a team due to limited resources. In that case, our newspaper has a "Collective Recognition Team Form" (available at the Social Service Office of this newspaper), which can be used to gather five or six or more like-minded people to jointly recognize a team. Only one person needs to be responsible for collecting donations and deciding on the team name, which can still be published in the next issue of this newspaper. There is also a "Team Recognition Notice," which only needs to be filled out and sent in, and it will be published the next day, and a date will be set for collecting the money. Because some busy people forget to donate, as the saying goes, "important people are forgetful." In this case, we hope that familiar people will promote it at any time, and if the notice is filled out and sent in or a phone call is made, our office will immediately send someone to discuss it, which is a very simple method.</p>
<p>Baizhi Scholarship Donates Large Sum</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Cunren of the Guoyi Clinic at No. 2 Weihaiwei Road has spared no effort in sponsoring our newspaper's scholarship fund in the past. His Baizhi Scholarship, which he runs, has helped 20 university students each year. In addition to those who have already graduated, there are still more than a dozen students. Mr. Chen, noting that tuition fees will increase again next year, and that poor students may drop out of school, generously donated 500,000 yuan yesterday, which he named the "Baizhi Scholarship Team." Mr. Chen specializes in internal medicine and has a deep understanding of medicine. He has also written many books. He focuses on education and benefits the poor, making him a benevolent and admirable person!</p>
<p>Regular Teams</p>
<p>Team 20: Baizhi Scholarship Team, 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 21: Xia Huanxin Team (donation from Chengde Girls' Middle School trustee for military expenses), 100,000 yuan, Total raised to date: 5,399,000 yuan</p>
<p>Scholarship funds received yesterday: Continued donation from the Silk and Satin Bureau, 50,000 yuan; Hua Shouyu, Zhong Xiutangfang, Cao Shixin, and Gu Yi, 10,000 yuan; Shi Quan, 5,000 yuan. Total received: 85,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Application Procedures for New and Returning Students for the Ninth Scholarship</p>
<p>Application for Returning Students: Returning students should bring their school registration certificate to the hall to obtain an application form, fill it out, and submit it to their original school for a letter of recommendation. The school will then send it to the office. The time for obtaining the application form is limited to 8:00 AM to 10:30 AM every day. Someone can be entrusted to obtain it on behalf of the student, but they must bring the student's school registration certificate with them. The "application period" is scheduled as follows. I hope everyone will pay attention:</p>
<p>July 12: Grades 1 and 2 of Senior Elementary School and Junior High School</p>
<p>July 13: Grade 2 of Junior High School and Grade 3 of Junior High School</p>
<p>July 14: All grades of Senior High School, University, and Vocational School</p>

Students can apply to the schools starting on July 17. Applications will only be accepted if recommended by the school. If new students come directly to the hall to obtain an application form, it will not be issued.</p>
<p>All new and returning students this year must undergo strict screening before they can be approved.</p>

Omega forfeited for the second time and was disqualified in accordance with the regulations. Baihua and the Blue Team won without effort. Ronghui fought Torch. The strength of the two teams was very different. Rong Guangzhu celebrated victory more and more, performing well and defeating Torch 38 to 13. Nanyou fought Yongsheng. In the first half, Nanyou had an absolute advantage with a score of 20 to 0. In the second half, Yongsheng counterattacked strongly and seemed to be on the verge of tying the score, but unfortunately, they had lost too many points in the first half and ultimately lost. The results of yesterday's games are as follows:</p>
<p>Baihua won over Youai Black (B7) by default, Rongguang won over Torch (B1) 38-13, Xinsheng Basketball won over Qi Team (B3) 16-6, Zihong won over Yiyou (B5) 32-26, Tongyi won over Yeguang (B6) 28-20, Nanyou won over Yongsheng (B4) 38-13, Blue Team won over Omega (B1) by default.</p>

<h3 id="e33">General Overview of Zhoupu <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>On Shangnan Road</p>
<p>On the morning of June 29th, your reporter drove to the South Wharf and bought a boat to cross the river. The boat was small, accommodating six or seven people. First, I bought a support pole at Litou for 1,000 yuan. By the time I arrived at Zhoujiadu, it was 9:00 AM. At the Shangnan Railway Station, the passengers waiting for military transport were lined up like a long snake. Upon boarding, due to the scarcity of trains and the abundance of passengers, there were no seats available, and even standing room was scarce. The crowded situation was no less severe than on the Beijing-Shanghai train. I arrived at Zhoupu at 11:15 AM. Zhoupu is the terminus of Shangnan Road, passing through Xinma Road, Yangsi Bridge, Sanlintang, Tianhua Temple, Bai , and arriving at Zhoupu, totaling seven stations. The journey took about an hour. I heard that several years ago, the trains were much faster, but now, due to the old and worn-out machinery and uneven tracks, the bumps are quite severe, making the journey slower than before.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Transportation</p>
<p>Zhoupu is the leading town in Nanhui, and even in the entire Pudong area, it is one of the top towns. The entire area is about three or four *li* in circumference, with streets crisscrossing and houses lined up in rows. However, the streets are narrow, making it difficult for rickshaws to pass. There are vegetable and seed markets in the early morning and at noon. According to a survey by the local town office, the population is distributed among 63 *bao* (units), 248 *jia* (sub-units), 2,696 households, totaling 11,650 men and women. However, according to your reporter's observation, it is likely more than this number. When inquiring with local elders, they also said it is at least double that.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation, besides Shangnan Road, there are highways connecting to Nanhui and Datuan. Usually, there are public buses running between them. However, due to poor security in the rural areas, with frequent bandit and guerilla troop appearances, these buses were stopped a while ago. Now, there is only a truck similar to a public bus, which can accommodate a dozen people. The schedule is irregular, roughly two trips a day, departing as soon as it's full, costing 15,000 yuan per person. In addition, there are cars from the East Asia Company available for private charter. The fare to Nanhui is 140,000 yuan, recently increased to 200,000 yuan, which, when split among seven or eight people, amounts to about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per person. Departing from Zhoupu, it takes only forty minutes to arrive if no delays occur along the way. For water transport, there are two shipping companies sailing to Nanhui and Datuan, one trip each afternoon. The departure times of the two ships are similar, with a fare of 6,000 yuan to Nanhui, which is cheaper than taking a car, but takes more than four hours. Also, safety is not guaranteed en route. I heard that these two ships have been inspected by guerilla troops several times in the past two months. Fortunately, they were not encountered by bandits, otherwise both people and property would have been lost.</p>
<p>Rice Market Conditions</p>
<p>The local four rural districts produce very little rice, but due to developed land and water transportation and its location as a necessary thoroughfare, the town is a distribution center for rice, forming the commercial center of the entire city. Most of the rice comes from Lüxian, Jinshan, Songjiang, and other places. During the rice control period, rice merchants, seeking security along the way, often used small boats to transport rice to the town through small ports. Then, small vendors buy it in small quantities and resell it to households. Women carry one or two *dou* (unit of measure) at a time, while men use bicycles, which can carry more than one *dan* (unit of measure). On Shangnan Road, one can see bicycles carrying rice everywhere, continuously along the way. Once past the Dragon King Temple blockade line, it is equivalent to passing all three checkpoints. Without any obstacles or minor expenses, one can safely transport the rice to Shanghai. During the period when rice was not allowed to be freely transported, if one could pass through the entire route, the profit was extremely high, so many people came here to buy in small quantities for resale.</p>
<p>After Liberalization</p>
<p>When rice prices in Shanghai rose from tens of thousands to nearly one million, the local rice prices were consistently 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower than those in Shanghai. For example, when rice prices in Shanghai reached 900,000 yuan, they were 600,000 yuan in Zhoupu. Because of this, rice traders were even more enthusiastic. However, because of the scarcity of rice in the producing areas and some rice merchants hoping to profit from hoarding as prices rose day and night, they collected rice, resulting in a sudden decrease in the amount transported to the town. To maintain its own local interests, the local administrative authorities, on the one hand, restricted rice from leaving the area, and on the other hand, moderately increased rice prices to ensure a smooth supply. Since the implementation of emergency rice measures, the authorities, in accordance with central laws, have allowed free passage. However, because rice merchants were hoarding for speculation, and rice was allowed to be transported directly from Jinshan and Songjiang to Shanghai without having to pass through Zhoupu, the rice available in the town has been decreasing day by day. Some small vendors with more capital, seeing that the rice price in the town was equal to that in Shanghai and there was no profit to be made, went directly to the producing areas to purchase and transport rice directly to Shanghai. Regarding the situation along the way, your reporter interviewed several rice vendors. Besides paying a 0.5% security and police subsidy fee in the town, there were no other expenses in the places they passed through. There were some occasional small extortions, but the amounts were small. As for the security and police subsidy fee, it was newly established within the past half month and set up at key points along the road, with dedicated personnel collecting the fees. All food and daily necessities passing through are subject to the fee, with food being 0.5%. Given that the local rice price is 600,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan is collected per *dan*, plus a handling fee of 600 yuan. Daily necessities are charged at 1%, calculated based on the invoice of the goods.</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>In Zhoupu, there were originally more than 130 rice shops, but within June, over 40 of them have closed down. Your reporter asked an old rice shop owner about the reasons for the closure. He said that the supply fee was too heavy, and an average rice shop needed to have a capital of over a million yuan. However, according to your reporter's investigation, half of the closed 40 rice shops are still doing business behind closed doors, using closure as an excuse to avoid paying various taxes, and finding some influential people to support them, engaging in hoarding and waiting for prices to rise. Only a few rice shops with insufficient capital, having sold rice at a time of crazy price increases but not being able to buy it back at a similar price, and suffering from high supply fees, had no choice but to close down.</p>
<p>Cash Panic</p>
<p>Shanghai is surrounded by cash panic, with the malpractice of bank draft notes. The same situation exists in Zhoupu, and it is even more severe than in Shanghai. There are more than 30 banks and money shops, regardless of the size of their capital, all issuing bank draft notes, and the number of notes issued even exceeds the capital amount by several times. These speculative financial businesses, on one hand, absorb cash and secretly divert it, and on the other hand, arbitrarily issue bank draft notes, widely collecting rice and daily necessities. As a result, bank draft notes flood the market, and even things worth thousands of yuan are traded with bank draft notes. Bank draft notes from Shanghai are not valid in Zhoupu because counterfeit notes have been discovered, causing a loss of credibility. In reality, the local bank draft notes have no credibility at all. They are truly a major enemy that promotes economic collapse, disrupts finance, and is the main cause of soaring prices.</p>
<p>Education and Hygiene</p>
<p>Teachers receive relatively good treatment, not just a salary of several thousand yuan, but a monthly allocation of five *dou* of rice. This rice is obtained through donations from all sectors of society to the district office. There is one county-run Second Middle School, one private Yaguang Middle School, and five public and private elementary schools. The principal of the county-run middle school is also the district head. In terms of hygiene, the two most notable achievements are the clinic established by the friendly army and the free clinic and medicine dispensing service provided by Chunyang Temple. There is also a medical clinic named Fushan, which often goes out to raise donations with donation books, but it is no longer as good as its name suggests, and its medical expenses are often higher than those of private medical clinics.</p>
