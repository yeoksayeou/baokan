<h3>蘇北保安隊增強實力</h3>
<p>中央社泰興訊　蘇北綏靖公署，自孫良誠將軍接任主任後，強化機構，頗着勞績，其最顯著者爲加强蘇北門戶之泰興軍事配備，編置蘇北保安第一總隊，委前第十九師師長蔡鑫元任總隊長，期增强工作效率，而置共匪於全部消減。蔡總隊長奉命後，即積極對各部隊配備力事强化，在編制上與各省保安司令部組織相仿，總隊長以下，設置數團六大隊及特務通信情報等隊。其他有政訓，秘書，軍法，參謀，副官，軍需，軍械，軍衣等八處，除對部隊努力加强外，最近更修築城防，增強各區據點，以爲在消減共匪軍事工作上得順利推進，現潛伏於各區之共匪，均已被迫他去。</p>
<h3>集思廣益共籌良策　供政府施政參考　陳代主席對大會代表之訓詞</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　陳代主席對各省市戰時民衆代表大會訓詞：各省市戰時民衆代表會議，以首都各界民衆代表之發起，今在首都國民大會堂隆重舉行，各地代表遠道蒞京，不辭勞瘁，不僅爲與會諸君愛國熱忱之表現，亦足徵全國民衆對國家責任觀念之堅強。承此大東亞戰爭已進入法戰階段，國家民族憶面臨空前危機之時，全國國民衆代表之集會，其意義實至爲深長。中國今日瘡痍滿目，雈苻遍地，而全面和平猶未實現，危急存亡，間不容髮，吾人於感奮之餘，允應加倍警惕，體念責任之重大。汪故主席曾昭示吾人，一個國家，一個民族之能生存獨立與吾，視其人民心力物力之集合與運用如何，由此可見，民爲邦木，此理實萬世不易。復云，必民力充實，國力始能擴充，必民生安中，民力始能充實，故興建工作富以民生安定爲第一要義，戰爭期間，民生的吾與日俱增，不獨我國爲然，世界各國無不如是，但吾人必須認淸中國民衆所受一切舊痛，皆舊秩序中反動勢之所賜，不能刻苦耐勞，徒事怨天允人，　無補於實際，國家民族之苦痛，唯國人之努力方能解除，國人切身之苦痛，亦唯有在國家民族苦痛解除之後，方能解脫。</p>
<p>中國外遭英美帝國主義之束縛，內受軍閥匪共之搗亂，垂數十年，國力民命疲敝已極，欲求民族之自由解放與國家之復興建設，必須遵奉國父造敎，秉承在故主席遺志，全國上下共同努力，向外求獨立自由，內求和平統一之目標，勇往邁進，方克有濟。五年以前，吾人手無寸鐵，呼籲和平，深知非和平統一不足以貢建國，亦唯有在建國過程中方能促成全面和平，當日還都所標「和平·反共·建國」三大政綱，即以和平爭取國家之自由，以反共實現國家之統一，以建國鞏固國家之獨立。五年夾之事實，已證明「和平反共建國」國策，更證明大東亞之建設與中國民族解放之不可分，今後舉國上下，更應强化此一國策之遂行，進而促成全面和平。全國統一，以謀東亞永久和平之實現，並須貫澈汪故主席昭示之中心勢力領導下，努力興建工作之主張，一致奮鬥。</p>
<p>今日濟濟一堂之各地民衆代表，皆各界預彥之士，自民衆立塲研討國是，必能集思廣益，共籌良策，以貢獻於政府，允盼　量發揮人民意志，俾供政府作施政之參考，並使建國信念確立，員普遍之奉行，目下戰局嚴重，人民無不望治至切，政府對於本會議之收獲亦深致期待，願與諸若共相勉　。</p>
<h3>沖繩附近綜合戰果　沉毀敵艦卅一艘　敵機撃落受損者百五十餘架</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　據二十七日之偵察，冲繩附近敵機動部隊之戰力，除戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦外，尚含有掃海艇四羣，第一　於沖繩本島東方，第二羣於該島西方，又第三羣於慶良間列島附近游戈中。其中敵第二羣，每四羣，二十七日繼續對沖繩本島施行砲撃，惟熾烈程度不及二十六日，是日入夜即行退避。他方敵艦載機二十七日以約四百三十架來襲沖繩各地，又是日上午八時四十五分起，敵巡洋艦，驅遂艦於久米島，十一時起至二十八日晨，含有戰艦之敵艦隊，於南大東島分別加以艦砲射擎，日方邀撃此等敵來寇之戰果，二十七日業經大本營發表，更將其後判明之戰果列後：（一）二十六日擊沉戰艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，驅逐艦四艘，擊毀巡洋艦一艦。此外，命中五百公斤直擎彈者戰襤一艘。命中魚雷者戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘。命中二百五十公斤直擊彈者戰艦一艘。又聽得戰艦一艘命中魚雷爆炸聲音，若再加算已發表之戰果，則此次冲繩海面日方之綜合戰果，截至二十七日止，計撃沉戰艦一艦，巡洋艦四艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，大型艦五艘，驅逐艦六艘，撃學或重創大型艦六艘，撃毀戰艦五艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦一艘，撃落飛機四十四架，擊毁約百十架，如上日方共計收獲擊沉艦艇十七艘，擊沉或重創五艘，擊毀九艘，擊落飛機四十四架，擊毀百十架之大戰果。</p>
<h3>B29型敵機夜襲北九州　被撃落者共十架以上</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營二十八日上午十一時半發表：B29型機六七十架，二十七日十時三十分許，再度來製北九州，歷一小時半，　夜兩次之來襲，損害極少，擊落敵機十架以上。</p>
<h3>美坦克隊先鋒開抵魯爾區</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德軍當局宣稱：美軍機甲部隊先鋒，二十七日開抵羅爾（Lohr在法蘭克福束方六十公里）工業區。萊因·曼恩兩河合流點之戰事正漸趨激烈，爰巴頓麾下之美第三軍主力，似以德南部爲目標。</p>
<h3>大陸總反攻凖備</h3>
<p>由於美國太平洋攻勢的迅速推動，而大陸戰綫也愈益表現出「山雨欲來風滿樓」的決戰象徵。「初生犢兒不怕虎」的美國駐渝司令長官維特米爾，竟敢向在華百萬日本精銳部隊挑戰說，願同日本在大陸決一死戰。重慶代理行政院長宋子文也曾一再正式聲明，說在今年內實行大陸總反攻，爲證明這種言論，抗戰中國值得注目的行動，最近愈益明朗化。重慶政權主要的目的，因然在於消減軸心國家，但敵方的總反攻凖備，只要有美渝的勾心鬥角關係，則站在抗戰中國內部問題的立塲上說，大陸攻熱是否能一帆風順，誠屬疑問。</p>
<p>開始整訓重慶軍隊</p>
<p>從表面上的現階段來說，決定大陸總反攻的性格者，有三稱要素：即（一）渝印公路通車以後，（二）國共問題的發展，（三）山於重慶召集六全大會而生的各種情形。</p>
<p>二月底業打通的渝印公路，改名爲史蒂威爾公路，現在業已形成總反攻準備的大動脈了。同時，但也不能不注意這將成爲美國勢力源源不斷侵入的後門，重慶打通這一條公路的時侯，曾新成立一個戰時運輸管理局，委託麻克魯亞美軍參謀長管理，接着從二月初就開始整訓重慶軍隊了。</p>
<p>整軍的內容，就是按美軍駐渝司令長官維特米爾，少將麻克魯亞，參謀總長何應欽，軍政部長陳誠等之合作，決定實行重慶每軍司一令官參謀的撤換，每軍配以美人參謀，每團配以美國砲兵或坦克隊，每運配以美國機關槍隊或工兵隊。二月裏整頓四川，貴州，陝西三省內中央及地方軍隊，從三月起開始整頓雲南，甘肅二省的軍隊，然後逐漸擴展推行於其他各省。與此同時，設立後方勤務總司令部，以駐紥昆明的美軍司令史瓦塞和少將劉奇爲正副司令，担任整軍用的武器，彈藥，軍糧等之補充。何應欽就任陸空兩軍總司令，同時又劃分貴州及雲南爲兩大遠征軍邊區。爲使中國西南的軍事地位成爲總反攻的最大據點，所以重慶政權把軍政大權分開，主要軍事機構移至昆明，成立中國陸軍最高統帥部，隨同何應欽，美國將領席諾德（美國駐渝十四航定隊司令）和史瓦塞等，也移節昆明。）和史瓦塞等，也移節昆明。</p>
<p>圖在華登陸的前奏</p>
<p>這稱軍事行動的目的，按蔣介石爲泰國，越南，華南聯合國軍隊的司令長官，也可以知這重慶在注意越南和華南。但更可注意者，即重慶鎭日呼號的總反攻主動權，無論在那一方面，早已都轉移到国軍隊之手。按蔣介石的野心來說，表面上似乎想配合美国軍隊在中國登陸的步調，實際上是想袖手傍觀日美兩軍的大決戰，但反攻準備的綱領，業已操之於美軍掌握了。前任美軍司令官史蒂威爾所失敗的企圖，業經現任的維持米爾及麻克魯亞之手，逐漸完成了。由於渝印公路的打通，美軍這樣迅速支配了重慶軍隊，這就是美軍在中國大陸登陸的前奏。</p>
<p>美國勢力的深入中國情形，在內地戰時經濟的所有部門內都可以看得出來。美軍的局部給養，甚至也在中國達到自足自給的地步了。在物資供懸方而，甚至在戰區內早巳表現出美國的對日經濟戰了。例如，重慶當局按附屬於戰時生產局下的美渝聯合生產委員會指令，在收買銅幣及亞鉛等，但以美國金條爲保證的重浚通貨，和中備券的兌換率，一變前此的二對一比例，反而成爲一對十四的比例。美國勢力的對華侵略，決不限於戰時經濟部門，但爲了抗戰力量的增强，重慶政權甚至陷於不能拒絕美國由正面而來的內政干涉了。</p>
<p>美在渝取得支配權</p>
<p>延安問題，就是一個最好的例證，延安代表周恩來赴渝進行兩星期多的交涉，重慶方面由於延安有美國民主勢力的支持，不得不作相當的讓步。但最後，延安對於重慶的不肯放鬆「家天下」政策，終於鬧翻，周恩來於十四日便憤憤然回歸延安。按重慶宣傳部長王世杰的聲明，可以知道重慶決定承認延安的合法地位，延安代表可參加軍事委負會，組織延安及其他各黨各派代表的國民黨戰時內閣，改編八路軍，由中央加以補充。近來，重慶當局一面指令各省組織聯合政府委員會，同時還贈與延安的國際紀念病院以美國捐助的十噸醫藥品。重慶的不得不讓步，也是由於美國藉口中國不統一，會削弱抗戰力量，以致美國千涉中國的內政。國共交涉決裂後，二月十五日美國駐渝司令官維特米爾聲明擁護重慶，這是大可注意的事。按維特米爾的立塲說，美國業已在重慶的軍政經各方面取得了支配權的時候，自然就不願再支持比較民主的延安政治，實際上這等於對重慶的最大侮辱。不待言，重慶要人也都很知道這一點，所以重慶在焦頭爛額地忙於消減異己，强化國民黨武力統一中國的工作。</p>
<p>日方注意決戰施策</p>
<p>今年五月五日召開六全大會，接着就是十三中全會，第四次參政會，以及國民代表大會等，目的在於試探中國人民對重慶的能度。最近，蔣介石一有機會總是向重慶的軍政民三方聲述，目前重要問題，決不在於獨裁制或民生制，而是在於中國人本身上的覺醒。然而重慶的抗戰建國基本方策，由於軍事上的要求，不得不依賴美國，因爲重慶政府不能單獨反攻。重慶在大聲疾呼今年向日本總反攻，但是重慶將取得自主反攻，抑是受美國擺佈反攻，這將大成問題。抗戰中國的動向，固然要看敵美軍隊在太平洋上直　日本本土的情形而定，但上述各種現象，就是決定敵人大陸總反攻性質的要素。我們日本對於大陸決戰施策，也憑當充分注意這一點。（林譯自三月九日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>論中國大陸作戰</h3>
<p>敵美在太平洋作戰，由塞班島而菲律賓而硫黃島，最近又向冲繩島企圖登陸，於是，一部分人以爲敵美的戰略方針巳經改變，放棄大陸作戰而向日本本土前進了。可是，從整個大東亞的戰局最近的形勢觀察，敵美固然有向日本本土進犯的趨勢；然而敵美在向日本本土進犯的時候，同時絕對不會放棄中國大陸作戰的企圖，這是不可忽略的。</p>
<p>爲什麼說敵人在對日本本土進犯，同時決不放棄大陸戰塲化的戰略呢？</p>
<p>第一，就敵美的政戰二略說，它的對日作戰，真正目的在乎恢復遠東的殖民地，並進一步實現對太平洋的制覇。要達到這一目標，至低限度必須同時屈服日本和中國。如果進犯日本本土，則是屈服日本最主要也最冒險的一著，然而仍不能實現制覇太平洋的夢想，因爲同時還未曾屈服中國，况且它的北方還有窺伺着的蘇聯！因此，敵美在屈服日本的政略和戰略中，必須同時屈服中國，所以在對日本本土作戰中，將同時準備及實施大陸作戰，在協助重慶的美名之下，達到同時制服中國的野心。</p>
<p>第二，從敵英的政戰二略說，由於形格勢禁，夢想再覇遠東已不可能，但是如何恢復過去在遠東的地位，是邱吉爾以下幾年來所寢寐不忘的！他們雖無力對日本本土冒險，唯一可與敵美競爭的，就是協力於大陸戰爭，道是敵英正在積極部署中的戰略方針，不容忽視的。</p>
<p>第三，從渝共的政戰二略說，重慶在目前形勢之下，受敵美挾持，旣不能與日本言和，爲謀維持政權計，也不能不喊着準備總反攻。至於中共，向來是製造動亂而從中起家的，大陸戰塲化以後，兵　之下，正是爲他們造成發展的條件，所以他們很積極推動對日總反攻的</p>
<p>大陸戰塲化的趨勢，由於美英渝共彼此政戰二略方針所決定的。今日本報譯載每日新聞的「大陸總反攻準備」一文，更可充分明瞭。但是，大陸戰塲化的前途如何？三月二十六日大陸新報社評「大陸作戰與中國民衆」一文，也有極可注目的指示。敵人的戰略，也許是以沿海登陸，配合着渝方的所謂總反攻，以及轟炸等同時進行，或參差進行。就今日大陸戰略地形而言，日軍己分布於各戰略衝要，主要港灣的交通基地，因此，敵方企圖以速戰速決是絕對不可能實現的，戰局勢必持久！但以大陸沿海綫之綿長，渝共部隊配合之不易，於是敵美的登陸，惟有使中國沿海經濟文化建設及民衆蒙受重大犧牲。因此，我們爲國家民族的生存計，應盡一切力量反對美英渝共以中國爲犧牲的大陸作戰。同時，大東亞戰爭是整個的，無論是日本本土作戰，中國大陸作戰，中日兩國軍民都應視爲同樣性質的對敵共同作戰，無分彼此，共以全力爭取勝利。所以，我們對於怎樣促成中日更趨團結協力，應付艱巨的決戰任務，這是中日兩國當局目前最迫切需要把握的課題。誠如大陸新報所論：「大陸作戰是最急烈的武力戰，同時也是爭取中國民衆的政治戰和思想戰……日本在這一點上，爲眞正爭取中國民衆，必須對過去的政策加以反省，而實行各種新的斷然措置。」</p>
<p>總之，決定時負的，軍事力量之外，更根本的主要決定力，還是雙方的政治力，也就是民心的趨向，誰能把握最大多數的民心，誰是最後的勝利者。我們希望中日兩國常局趁此迫切時機，趕快檢討一下相互的政治力，更進一步促成團結力量，應付嚴重局面。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>大陸作戰與中國民眾</h3>
<p>按最近敵人攻　的動向，由塞班島進至硫黃島，又以機動部隊出沒於日本近海，可見大有在日本本土登陸之形勢。即按敵人揚言大舉侵攻日本本土說，也可以曉得日本遲早將成爲戰塲，所以需要準備萬一。但應注意者，敵人縱令想一氣衝入日本本土，但也決不會因此而放棄中國登陸的企圖。敵方固然在窺伺侵入日本本土的機會，但也在準備中國登陸作戰的客觀條件。這是現實的情形，如果單從最近兩三個現象來觀察，認爲敵人將放棄中國登陸作戰，而專攻日本本土，這將是極危險的判斷。縱令敵人敢在中國沿岸登陸，但日本駐華派遣軍的完整無缺，又加上早已完成了嚴陣以待的戰略佈置和秣馬厲兵的訓驟，是不容許敵人有所蠢動的。敵人的作戰方法與過去逈乎不同，現在是採用龐大大兵員及巨量武器登陸的，在這一點上，日本將遇到絕頂困難。敵人縱能在綿長的中國沿海綫某處登陸，運來大量兵士，但在與重慶軍取得連繫前，很有被殲減的可能。退一步說，縱能如彼等所願，相當兵力登陸後，與重慶軍取得連絡，但大陸戰爭也決不能速戰速決，一定會是長期的消耗戰。所以如展開大陸上的決戰，一定會給中國民衆以極大的損害。但重慶政權偏偏幸災樂禍，極端歡迎美國登陸作戰，慫恿美國最短期內實現，這真是不顧本國人民利益的一種罪惡行爲。</p>
<p>已如上述，敵人縱令胆敢實行中國登陸作戰，但如不能與重慶軍取得連絡，如不能爭取中國人民的擁護，則不能進行大規模及長期的戰爭。換言之，大陸作戰是最激烈的武力戰，同時也是爭取中國民衆的政治戰和思想戰。雖然過去也是這樣，但現在由於戰局的吃緊，而更加明朗化和普遍化了。日本在這一點上需要重新估計一下過去的政策，應常仔細地考慮，如何能使中國民衆澈底瞭解大東亞戰爭的意義，如何能使中國民衆瞭解直接或間接協助日軍，就是謀中國民衆的真正解放和福社之前提條件。高揭道義爲戰爭目標的日本，在此次戰爭上理應比較筆人有更有利的條件。但爲真正爭取中國民衆，日本必須對過去的政策加以反省，而實行各種新的斷然措置。現在竟有一種人，藉口戰局的緊迫，便想放棄中國的各種政治施策和思想施策，這是大錯而特錯的。他們藉口軍事第一，作戰需要高於一切，而極裝偏狹地曲解了軍事及作戰需要的意義，竟忽略了只有把握中國民衆才是具有不下於武力戰的重要性者。這種人也是高揭着日本的道義戰爭目標，而又不想爭取中國民衆擁護自己的敗北主義者，逃避論者，這決非具有自信者所應採取的能度。正當中國將化爲一大戰塲時，我們日本人應當根據現實，澈底認眞討論一下，如何才能在我們的周圍團結中國民衆。（譯自三月二十六日大陸新報社評）</p>

<h3>心理建設與國家建設　市府羅秘書長廣播詞</h3>
<p>三十日爲國府還都五週年紀念，市府羅秘書長應宣傳部之請，特於二十八日晚八時二十分，向全國廣播，題爲「心理建設與國家建設」，歷時二十分鐘始畢，原文如次：</p>
<p>兩種手段一個目的</p>
<p>建國是艱難的，我們要建設一個現代化的國家尤其是艱難的。國民政府還都南京，五週年了，以五年的努力，還沒有實現全面和平，這自然是每一和運的同志所說爲極大遺憾的。但是在五年中間，百年來全國人民　求願望的不平等條約的廢止，租界的收回，都一一實現了，也就是實現了國父孫先生的遺囑中的最重要的部份。國府還都五週紀念將臨的今日，汪故主席雖然棄我們而長逝了，陳代主席繼承汪故主席的遺志，領導我們繼續邁進，我們當然本着我們對國家民族赤忱効命的初衷，齊步向前更進。還都以來，汪故主席昭示中外的國策是「和平」「反共」「建國」三大原則，以和平爭取中國的自由，以反共實現中國的統一，以建國鞏固中國的獨立，也可以說和平與反共是兩種必要的手段，建國是一個最後的目的。所謂建國，當然要使中國成爲一個現代化的國家，屹然獨立於世界。</p>
<p>心理建設必須完成</p>
<p>我們旣然是要使中國成爲現代化的國家，回顧五年來的政治與社會的實况，我們當然不敢自欺欺人地認爲滿意，匪共依然如此猖獗，民生依然如此疾苦，貪依汚然，未能全部肅淸，民意依然未能及時暢達，造成這些現象的原因，留然是十分複雜的。我以爲其中最重大的因素，是由於建國心理的缺乏或衰弱，國父於倡導革命數十年之後，退而手定建國方略，痛心疾首於革命黨人思想的錯誤，以致於阻碍了國家的建設，妨害了革命的完成，毅然以心理建設爲建國方略的開篇。我們撫今思昔，緬懷國父的敎訓，深感心理建設是國家建設的泉源和動力，心理建設不能完成，決不能養成健全的國民，也不能產生合理的政治。就此時此地的上海而論，百年來的英美帝國主義者殖民政策所毒化奴化過的領域，社會是畸形的，多數市民的心理，也不免是畸形的。本人這次隨同周先生到上海來擔任地方行政工作，周先生　告市民的兩句話是「社會先於個人，公益重於私利。」本人所提出的口號是：「使上海成爲中國的上海。」這些就是我們對於心理建設的一點起碼的要求。許多日子以來，上海人腦子裏有了美國軍隊或者登陸的影子，暗中歡喜者有之，感覺恐慌者有之，企圖避免者有之，想要渾水摸魚者亦有之。總之是以自私一念爲出發點，而形成各種各色的畸形心理。</p>
<p>畸形心理澈底改造</p>
<p>上海本來是冒險家的樂園，上海本來是一個有名的謠言都市，畸形的人，畸形的心理，造成一切畸形的現象·我認爲有痛下針炙，澈底改造的必要。近來耳裏聽了許多表現上海人畸形心理的例子，姑舉一二事作證：某一家皮鞋店的老　告訴他的夥計，不妨廉價將店裏的現存的舶不品皮鞋全部出賣。，他說英美人快來了，一定會帶來許多新花樣的新貨色，這舊型的存貨，還不該早點出淸嗎。又有些絲綢商人，雖然在絲綢落價的時候，仍然不願將他的存貨脫手，他們的理由是絲綢是很好的國際貿易的出口貨，他們正等待着他們的好日子的來臨。懷着這種淺薄兒戲自私的觀念的人，恐怕不在少　。戰爭是神聖的，參加戰爭的國家，聽命於國家而從事作戰的國民，必須具有神聖的責任觀念。戰局的推展，是由於戰爭指導者依據戰略與政略的要求與運用而決定其方向與時限的。冥冥之中是不是有甚麽戰神，我們無法證實，我相信戰神也不過戰爭指導者的一名傳令兵而已。中國很不幸的，一面有在英美旗幟之下的抗戰陣營，一面有與日本協同努力的參戰集團，做國民的根據他自己的意志，左袒也好，右袒也成，當局本切須乎加以强强迫，但是以第三者的姿態，不盡義務，不負責任，滿口說風涼話，只偷偷摸摸做些自私自利的事，那就是非國民的　離份子，這是要不得的。戰神　到我們的頭上了，逃避是不可能的，等死是無益的，站起來，負責任，武裝起來，實行自衛，這是第一要　。</p>
<p>激揚大衆責任觀念</p>
<p>我們看看　　硫黃　的日本守備軍，戰至一兵一卒而同歸於盡的超乎勝利以上的精神，此無他，他們共同具有一種大仁大勇的忠君愛國的神聖責任觀念而已。建國是艱難的，建設一個現代化的國家，尤其是艱難的。今天是我們中國國民黨七十二烈士殉國紀念的前夕，想起先烈殺身成仁的英風，自念大家在艱苦中的奮鬥，深覺革命尙未成功，建國尤待努力，後死者眞有無窮的責任。我們決心要在　土上廢墟上復興我們的國家，我們首先要培養建國的心理，激　大家的神聖責任觀念，是心理建設的第一課。心理建設增加一分國家建設即成功一分。</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Security Forces Strengthen Their Strength</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Taixing - Since General Sun Liangcheng took over as Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters, he has strengthened the organization and achieved considerable success. The most prominent achievement is the strengthening of Taixing's military defenses, the gateway to northern Jiangsu. The First General Security Force of Northern Jiangsu was established, and Cai Xinyuan, the former commander of the 19th Division, was appointed as the commander-in-chief to enhance work efficiency and completely eliminate the Communist bandits. After receiving the order, General Cai actively strengthened the equipment of the various units. The organization is similar to that of the security command headquarters in various provinces. Under the commander-in-chief, there are several regiments, six battalions, and special task force, communication, and intelligence units. Other departments include political training, secretariat, military law, staff, adjutant, quartermaster, ordnance, and clothing departments. In addition to strengthening the troops, the city defenses have recently been rebuilt, and strongholds in various areas have been strengthened to ensure the smooth progress of the military work of eliminating the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits who were lurking in various areas have all been forced to leave.</p>
<h3>Gathering Ideas and Jointly Planning Good Strategies to Provide Reference for Government Policy Acting Chairman Chen's Instructions to Congress Representatives</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Acting Chairman Chen's instructions to the Wartime People's Congress of Various Provinces and Cities: The Wartime People's Congress of Various Provinces and Cities, initiated by representatives of all sectors of the capital, is now solemnly held in the National Assembly Hall in the capital. Representatives from various places have come to Nanjing from afar, enduring hardships. This is not only a manifestation of the patriotic enthusiasm of all of you, but also demonstrates the strong sense of national responsibility among the people of the whole country. As this Greater East Asia War has entered a critical stage, and the nation and the people are facing an unprecedented crisis, the assembly of national people's representatives has profound significance. China today is scarred and bandits are everywhere, and overall peace has not yet been achieved. Survival is in imminent danger. While we are inspired, we should be doubly vigilant and be mindful of the heavy responsibility. The late Chairman Wang once instructed us that the survival and independence of a country and a nation depends on how the people's minds, strength, and material resources are gathered and used. From this, it can be seen that the people are the foundation of the country, and this principle is eternally unchanging. Furthermore, he said that only when the people's strength is enriched can the national strength be expanded. Only when the people's livelihood is stable can the people's strength be enriched. Therefore, the most important thing in construction is the stability of the people's livelihood. During the war, the difficulties of the people's livelihood are increasing day by day. This is not only the case in our country, but also in all countries in the world. However, we must recognize that all the old pains suffered by the Chinese people are due to the reactionary forces in the old order. It is useless to be unwilling to endure hardship and only blame heaven and others. The suffering of the nation and the people can only be relieved by the efforts of the Chinese people. The personal suffering of the Chinese people can only be relieved after the suffering of the nation and the people is relieved.</p>
<p>China has been bound by British and American imperialism from the outside and disrupted by warlords and Communist bandits from the inside for decades. The national strength and the people's lives have been exhausted. To seek the freedom and liberation of the nation and the restoration and construction of the country, we must follow the teachings of the Father of the Nation and inherit the legacy of the late Chairman Wang. The whole country, from top to bottom, must work together, strive for independence and freedom externally, and strive for peace and unity internally, and move forward bravely to achieve success. Five years ago, we had no weapons in our hands and called for peace. We knew that peace and unity were necessary for construction, and only in the process of construction could overall peace be promoted. The three major programs of "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building" proclaimed at the time of the return to the capital were to strive for national freedom through peace, to achieve national unity through anti-communism, and to consolidate national independence through nation-building. The facts of the past five years have proven the national policy of "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building" and have further proven the inseparability of the construction of Greater East Asia and the liberation of the Chinese nation. In the future, the whole country, from top to bottom, should further strengthen the implementation of this national policy, further promote overall peace, national unity, and strive for the realization of permanent peace in East Asia. We must also implement the late Chairman Wang's call for working hard on construction under the leadership of the central force and struggle together.</p>
<p>Today, the people's representatives from all over the country are gathered together. They are all leading figures from all walks of life. Studying national affairs from the people's standpoint will surely gather ideas and jointly plan good strategies to contribute to the government. It is hoped that everyone will fully express the will of the people so as to provide a reference for the government's policy-making and to establish the belief in nation-building and widely implement it. At present, the war situation is serious, and the people are eager for governance. The government also has high expectations for the gains of this conference and is willing to work together with everyone.</p>
<h3>Overall War Results Near Okinawa 31 Enemy Ships Sunk More Than 150 Enemy Planes Shot Down or Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to reconnaissance on the 27th, the enemy's mobile fleet near Okinawa, in addition to battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, also contains four groups of minesweepers. The first group is east of Okinawa Island, the second group is west of the island, and the third group is cruising near the Kerama Islands. Among them, the enemy's second group, every four groups, continued to shell Okinawa Island on the 27th, but the intensity was not as high as on the 26th. They retreated that night. On the other hand, enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked various parts of Okinawa on the 27th with about 430 aircraft. Again, from 8:45 AM, enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled Kume Island, and from 11:00 AM to the morning of the 28th, enemy fleets containing battleships shelled Minami Daitō Island separately. The results of the Japanese interception of these enemy raiders, which were announced by the General Headquarters on the 27th, and the subsequent results are listed below: (1) On the 26th, one battleship, two destroyers, three cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, and four destroyers were sunk, and one cruiser was destroyed. In addition, one battleship was hit by a 500 kg direct-hit bomb. One battleship and two cruisers were hit by torpedoes. One battleship was hit by a 250 kg direct-hit bomb. Also, the sound of a torpedo exploding on a battleship was heard. If the already announced results are added, then the overall results of the Japanese side in the Okinawa waters up to the 27th are as follows: one battleship, four cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, five large ships, and six destroyers sunk. Six large ships were hit or heavily damaged. Five battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer were destroyed. 44 aircraft were shot down, and about 110 were destroyed. In total, the Japanese side achieved the great results of sinking 17 ships, sinking or heavily damaging 5 ships, destroying 9 ships, shooting down 44 aircraft, and destroying 110 aircraft.</p>
<h3>B-29 Enemy Planes Night Raid on Northern Kyushu More Than Ten Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 28th: Sixty to seventy B-29 aircraft attacked northern Kyushu again at about 10:30 on the 27th. The attacks lasted for one and a half hours, with two night raids. The damage was minimal, and more than ten enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<h3>US Tank Unit Vanguard Arrives in the Ruhr Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities announced: The vanguard of the US armored forces arrived in the Ruhr (Lohr, 60 kilometers east of Frankfurt) industrial area on the 27th. The fighting at the confluence of the Rhine and Main rivers is gradually intensifying. The main force of the US Third Army under Patton seems to be targeting southern Germany.</p>
<h3>Preparing for the General Counter-Offensive on the Mainland</h3>
<p>Due to the rapid advance of the American Pacific offensive, the mainland front is increasingly showing the ominous signs of an impending decisive battle. The US Commander in Chongqing, Weitmier, who is like a "newborn calf not afraid of the tiger", dared to challenge the million elite Japanese troops in China, saying that he was willing to fight a decisive battle with Japan on the mainland. Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing, has also repeatedly formally declared that a general counter-offensive on the mainland will be carried out this year. To prove these statements, the actions of anti-Japanese China that are worthy of attention have recently become increasingly clear. The main purpose of the Chongqing regime is, of course, to eliminate the Axis powers, but the enemy's preparations for the general counter-offensive, as long as there is a relationship of infighting between the US and Chongqing, then from the standpoint of the internal problems of anti-Japanese China, it is questionable whether the mainland offensive can go smoothly.</p>
<p>Starting to Reorganize and Train the Chongqing Army</p>
<p>From the superficial current stage, there are three key factors that determine the nature of the general counter-offensive on the mainland: namely, (1) after the opening of the Chongqing-India highway, (2) the development of the Kuomintang-Communist problem, and (3) the various situations arising from the convocation of the Sixth Plenary Session in Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Chongqing-India highway, renamed the Stilwell Road, which was opened at the end of February, has now formed the main artery for the preparation of the general counter-offensive. At the same time, it is also impossible not to pay attention to the fact that this will become the back door for the continuous intrusion of American forces. When Chongqing opened this highway, it newly established a Wartime Transportation Administration, entrusting it to US Army Chief of Staff Mark Looia for management. Then, from the beginning of February, it began to reorganize and train the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>The content of the military reorganization is the cooperation between General Weitmier, the US Army Commander in Chongqing, Major General Mark Looia, Chief of Staff Ho Yingchin, and Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng. It was decided to implement the replacement of the commander and staff of each Chongqing army division, equip each army with American staff, equip each regiment with American artillery or tank teams, and equip each transport unit with American machine gun teams or engineering teams. In February, the central and local armies in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Shaanxi provinces were reorganized. From March, the armies in Yunnan and Gansu provinces were reorganized, and then gradually expanded to other provinces. At the same time, the Rear Service Headquarters was established, with US Army Commander in Kunming Swasey and Major General Liu Qi as the commander and deputy commander, responsible for the supply of weapons, ammunition, and military food for the military reorganization. Ho Yingchin took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Air Force, and Guizhou and Yunnan were divided into two major expeditionary army border areas. In order to make China's southwest military position the largest stronghold for the general counter-offensive, the Chongqing regime separated military and political power and moved the main military institutions to Kunming, establishing the Supreme Command of the Chinese Army. Along with Ho Yingchin, American generals Sinode (Commander of the US 14th Air 定隊 stationed in Chongqing) and Swasey also moved to Kunming.</p>
<p>A Prelude to Landing in China</p>
<p>The purpose of this military action is to know that Chongqing is paying attention to Vietnam and South China because Chiang Kai-shek is the commander of the joint forces of Thailand, Vietnam, and South China. But what is more noteworthy is that the initiative for the general counter-offensive that Chongqing shouts about every day has already been transferred to the hands of the American army. According to Chiang Kai-shek's ambition, on the surface, he seems to want to cooperate with the pace of the American army landing in China, but in reality, he wants to stand by and watch the decisive battle between the Japanese and American armies. However, the outline of the counter-offensive preparation has already been controlled by the American army. The failed attempt of former US Army Commander Stilwell has been gradually completed by the hands of the current Weitmier and Mark Looia. Due to the opening of the Chongqing-India highway, the US army has quickly controlled the Chongqing army, which is a prelude to the US army landing in mainland China.</p>
<p>The situation of the deep penetration of American power into China can be seen in all sectors of the inland wartime economy. The local supplies of the US army have even reached the point of self-sufficiency in China. In terms of material supply, the American economic war against Japan has already been manifested in the war zone. For example, the Chongqing authorities, according to the instructions of the US-Chongqing Joint Production Committee under the Wartime Production Bureau, are purchasing copper coins and zinc, etc., but the exchange rate between the heavy Chongqing currency, which is guaranteed by American gold bars, and the Central Reserve Bank has changed from the previous ratio of two to one to a ratio of one to fourteen. The American power's invasion of China is by no means limited to the wartime economic sector, but in order to enhance the anti-Japanese power, the Chongqing regime has even fallen into the position of not being able to refuse the American interference in internal affairs from the front.</p>
<p>US Obtains Dominance in Chongqing</p>
<p>The Yan'an problem is a good example. Yan'an representative Zhou Enlai went to Chongqing for more than two weeks of negotiations. The Chongqing side had to make considerable concessions because Yan'an had the support of American democratic forces. But in the end, Yan'an was dissatisfied with Chongqing's refusal to relax the "family world" policy, and Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an in anger on the 14th. According to the statement of Chongqing Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie, it can be known that Chongqing has decided to recognize the legal status of Yan'an. Yan'an representatives can participate in the Military Commission, organize a wartime cabinet of the Kuomintang with representatives from Yan'an and other parties, and reorganize the Eighth Route Army, which will be supplemented by the central government. Recently, the Chongqing authorities have instructed all provinces to organize joint government committees and have also donated ten tons of medical supplies donated by the United States to the International Memorial Hospital in Yan'an. Chongqing's having to make concessions is also due to the United States interfering in China's internal affairs on the grounds that China's disunity will weaken the anti-Japanese forces. After the breakdown of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, US Commander Weitmier in Chongqing declared his support for Chongqing on February 15, which is a noteworthy event. According to Weitmier's position, when the United States has already obtained dominance in Chongqing's military, political, and economic aspects, it is naturally unwilling to support the more democratic Yan'an politics. In reality, this is equivalent to the greatest insult to Chongqing. Needless to say, the important people in Chongqing also know this very well, so Chongqing is busy with eliminating dissidents and strengthening the Kuomintang's efforts to unify China by force.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Pays Attention to Decisive Battle Strategies</p>
<p>The Sixth Plenary Session will be convened on May 5 this year, followed by the Thirteenth Plenary Session, the Fourth Political Participation Council, and the National Assembly, etc., with the aim of testing the Chinese people's ability to tolerate Chongqing. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek has always stated to the military, political, and civilian parties in Chongqing that the important issue at present is not the dictatorial system or the livelihood system, but the awakening of the Chinese people themselves. However, Chongqing's basic policy of anti-Japanese resistance and nation-building has to rely on the United States due to military requirements, because the Chongqing government cannot launch a counter-offensive alone. Chongqing is clamoring for a general counter-offensive against Japan this year, but whether Chongqing will achieve an autonomous counter-offensive or be controlled by the United States will be a major issue. The direction of anti-Japanese China depends on the situation of the direct attack on the Japanese mainland by the enemy's American army in the Pacific, but the above-mentioned phenomena are the factors that determine the nature of the enemy's general counter-offensive on the mainland. Our Japan should pay full attention to this point in our mainland decisive battle strategy. (Translated by Lin from the March 9 Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On China Mainland Operations</h3>
<p>The enemy Americans, in their Pacific operations, have advanced from Saipan to the Philippines to Iwo Jima, and recently have attempted a landing on Okinawa Island. Consequently, some people believe that the enemy Americans' strategic policy has already changed, abandoning operations on the mainland and advancing toward the Japanese homeland. However, observing the recent situation of the overall Greater East Asia war situation, while it is true that the enemy Americans have a trend of invading the Japanese homeland, at the same time, they will absolutely not abandon the attempt to operate on the Chinese mainland. This cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Why do we say that the enemy, while invading the Japanese homeland, will never abandon the strategy of turning China into a battlefield?</p>
<p>First, considering the enemy Americans' political and military strategies, their true goal in the war against Japan lies in restoring their colonies in the Far East and further realizing their dominance over the Pacific. To achieve this goal, they must, at the very least, simultaneously subdue Japan and China. Invading the Japanese homeland is the most important and most risky move to subdue Japan, but it still cannot realize the dream of dominating the Pacific because China has not yet been subdued, and moreover, there is the Soviet Union watching in the north! Therefore, in the enemy Americans' political and military strategies to subdue Japan, they must simultaneously subdue China. Thus, in the operation against the Japanese homeland, they will simultaneously prepare and implement mainland operations, achieving their ambition to subdue China at the same time under the guise of assisting Chongqing.</p>
<p>Second, considering the enemy British's political and military strategies, due to circumstances, it is no longer possible to dream of dominating the Far East again. However, how to restore their past status in the Far East is something that Churchill and others have not forgotten for years! Although they lack the strength to take risks against the Japanese homeland, the only way they can compete with the enemy Americans is to cooperate in the mainland war. This is the strategic policy that the enemy British are actively deploying, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Third, considering the political and military strategies of the Chongqing government and the Communists, Chongqing, under the current situation, is held hostage by the enemy Americans. It cannot make peace with Japan, and in order to maintain its regime, it cannot help but shout about preparing for a general counter-offensive. As for the Chinese Communists, they have always made their start from creating turmoil. After the mainland becomes a battlefield, the chaos of war will create conditions for their development. Therefore, they are very actively promoting a general counter-offensive against Japan.</p>
<p>The trend of turning the mainland into a battlefield is determined by the political and military strategies of the Americans, British, Chongqing government, and Communists. Today, this newspaper is translating and publishing the "Preparation for General Counter-Offensive on the Mainland" article from the Mainichi Shimbun, which will make this even clearer. However, what is the future of turning the mainland into a battlefield? The editorial "Mainland Operations and the Chinese People" in the Mainland New Daily on March 26 also has extremely noteworthy indications. The enemy's strategy may be to land along the coast, coordinating with Chongqing's so-called general counter-offensive, as well as bombing, all conducted simultaneously or staggered. Considering today's mainland strategic terrain, the Japanese army has already been distributed to various strategic strongholds and key transportation bases in major ports. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for the enemy to achieve a quick victory. The war situation will inevitably be prolonged! However, with the long coastline of the mainland and the difficulty of coordinating the Chongqing Communist troops, the enemy Americans' landing can only cause significant sacrifices to China's coastal economic and cultural construction and the people. Therefore, for the sake of the survival of the country and the nation, we should do everything possible to oppose the Americans, British, Chongqing government, and Communists' mainland operations that sacrifice China. At the same time, the Greater East Asia War is a whole. Whether it is operations on the Japanese homeland or operations on the Chinese mainland, the military and civilians of both China and Japan should regard them as a common operation against the enemy of the same nature, without distinction between each other, and strive for victory with all their strength. Therefore, how to promote greater unity and cooperation between China and Japan to meet the arduous task of the decisive battle is the most urgent issue that the authorities of both China and Japan need to grasp at present. As the Mainland New Daily argues: "Mainland operations are the most intense military war, and at the same time, it is also a political war and ideological war to win over the Chinese people… In this regard, in order to truly win over the Chinese people, Japan must reflect on its past policies and implement various new and decisive measures."</p>
<p>In short, in addition to military strength, the fundamental determining factor is still the political power of both sides, that is, the direction of the people's hearts. Whoever can grasp the hearts of the largest majority of the people is the ultimate victor. We hope that the authorities of China and Japan will take advantage of this urgent opportunity to review their mutual political power and further promote unity to cope with the serious situation.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>Mainland Operations and the Chinese People</h3>
<p>According to the enemy's recent offensive trends, from Saipan to Iwo Jima, and the appearance of mobile units in the waters near Japan, it can be seen that there is a situation of landing on the Japanese mainland. According to the enemy's claim to launch a large-scale invasion of the Japanese homeland, it can be understood that Japan will sooner or later become a battlefield, so it is necessary to prepare for the worst. But it should be noted that even if the enemy wants to rush into the Japanese homeland in one breath, they will never give up their attempt to land in China. The enemy is indeed watching for opportunities to invade the Japanese homeland, but they are also preparing the objective conditions for mainland operations in China. This is the reality. It would be extremely dangerous to believe that the enemy will give up mainland landing operations in China and focus solely on the Japanese homeland, simply by observing the recent two or three phenomena. Even if the enemy dares to land on the Chinese coast, the intact state of the Japanese troops stationed in China, coupled with the strategic deployment that has long been completed in anticipation and the intensified training, will not allow the enemy to act rashly. The enemy's combat method is very different from the past. Now they are using large numbers of troops and huge amounts of weapons to land, which will present Japan with extreme difficulties. Even if the enemy can land somewhere on the long Chinese coastline and transport a large number of soldiers, they are likely to be annihilated before they can establish contact with the Chongqing army. Even if they can, as they wish, land a considerable force and establish contact with the Chongqing army, the mainland war cannot be resolved quickly, it will definitely be a long war of attrition. Therefore, if a decisive battle is launched on the mainland, it will definitely cause great damage to the Chinese people. But the Chongqing regime is gloating and extremely welcoming of the American landing operation, urging the United States to realize it in the shortest possible time. This is truly a criminal act that disregards the interests of its own people.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, even if the enemy dares to carry out a landing operation in China, if they cannot establish contact with the Chongqing army and if they cannot win the support of the Chinese people, they cannot conduct a large-scale and long-term war. In other words, mainland operations are the most intense military war, and at the same time, it is also a political war and ideological war to win over the Chinese people. Although this was the case in the past, it is now becoming clearer and more widespread due to the urgency of the war situation. In this regard, Japan needs to re-evaluate its past policies and should always carefully consider how to make the Chinese people thoroughly understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, and how to make the Chinese people understand that directly or indirectly assisting the Japanese army is a prerequisite for seeking the true liberation and welfare of the Chinese people. Japan, which has raised morality as a war goal, should have more favorable conditions than the enemy in this war. But in order to truly win over the Chinese people, Japan must reflect on its past policies and implement various new and decisive measures. Now there are some people who, on the pretext of the urgency of the war situation, want to abandon China's various political and ideological measures. This is a big mistake. They use the pretext of military first, and that operational needs are above all else, to narrowly distort the meaning of military and operational needs, and ignore that grasping the Chinese people is no less important than military warfare. These people are also raising the moral war goals of Japan, but they are defeatists and escapists who do not want to win the support of the Chinese people, which is definitely not an attitude that a confident person should take. At a time when China is about to turn into a major battlefield, we Japanese should thoroughly and seriously discuss, based on reality, how to unite the Chinese people around us.

<h3>All Sectors Prepare to Celebrate the Capital Relocation Anniversary Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The 30th of this month marks the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. All sectors of the city will hold the "Shanghai Special City All Sectors Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital Grand Assembly" on this day. Zhang Pei, head of the business section of the Municipal Propaganda Office, will report on the preparations for the assembly and the order of proceedings at the Shanghai Radio Station from 6:40 PM to 6:50 PM on the 29th, hoping that all sectors will tune in at that time.</p>
<p>Special Broadcast</p>
<p>The Shanghai Radio Station in this city, in celebration of the National Government's Return to the Capital anniversary, will broadcast a special commemorative program starting on the 29th.

Starting at 8:50 PM, Huang Zongying, a well-known figure in the theater world, will broadcast "Sweet Girl." Citizens of the city can tune in on time.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Given Grace Period for Business Hours</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities had previously restricted the business hours of entertainment venues in order to adapt to the wartime system, stipulating that they must close at 10:00 PM every night. It is now learned that since the implementation of this decree, the business of various entertainment venues has been depressed, and it has been difficult to maintain operations. They have repeatedly requested the authorities to consider their business difficulties and grant them a grace period. The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the fact that spring has arrived and summer is approaching, with longer days and shorter nights, believes that it is possible to grant a grace period for the business hours of entertainment venues. Therefore, after careful consideration and passage through the Bureau Affairs Meeting, it has been decided to temporarily extend the business hours of entertainment venues until 11:30 PM every night from April 1st to October 30th. However, electric lights can only be used until 10:00 PM, and other kerosene lamps should be used after 10:00 PM to save electricity.</p>
<h3>Post Office to Issue Capital Relocation Commemorative Stamps Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, in celebration of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, will issue commemorative stamps starting on the 30th, divided into four types: 15 yuan, 30 yuan, 60 yuan, and 200 yuan. On the first day of issue, only complete sets can be purchased, after which they will be supplied as usual. It is also heard that each post office will have commemorative postmarks available on the 30th, ready to cancel items on the spot as needed by customers.</p>
<h3>Goods for Sale Must Be Marked with Prices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau has repeatedly ordered that all retail stores in the city must attach labels to all goods sold, clearly marking the prices. It has recently reiterated its previous order. From now on, all stores must attach labels to all goods sold, clearly marking the prices, and affix the approved price list in a prominent place in the store. Anyone who violates this will be punished the first time and closed down the second time, without any leniency.</p>
<h3>More Than Seventy Illegal Cooking Oil Merchants Arrested; Currently Under Strict Investigation</h3>
<p>Recently, the black market for cooking oil in the city has become increasingly rampant, with prices differing from the set price by as much as double, and there have been cases of hoarding and refusing to retail. The Municipal Economic Police authorities, based on repeated secret reports, discovered that some illegal oil merchants and oil grain [unclear], were actually conducting black market illegal transactions and arbitrarily raising prices in the area of Datong Road and Tiantai Road, disrupting the market. Therefore, at noon on the 28th, a large number of officers were dispatched to the area, and more than seventy illegal oil merchants [unclear] and suspects were apprehended on the spot. They are currently under strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Material Review Efforts to Simplify</h3>
<p>In the past, when the Commercial Control Association and the five control associations below it encountered important material review and material transfer matters, they would first submit them to the Executive Yuan for review by the Material Review Committee. If it was deemed that further investigation or decision was required, it would be sent to the Shanghai Office of the Committee to liaise and meet with the Commercial Control Association or the various control associations. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had to assign a high-ranking official to come to Shanghai, which was inconvenient for the exchange of official documents and review time. Recently, Chairman Zhou and Secretary-General Chen of the Material Review Committee decided and instructed the Shanghai Office to handle matters in accordance with the following methods: If the Commercial Control Association has important cases, it may instruct the Shanghai Office of the Material Review Committee to convene a liaison meeting of the Commercial Control Association and the five control associations, and the office will send a representative from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to attend the meeting. After a formal decision is made, the office will submit it to the Material Review Committee.

<h3>Reminder to Collect Books and Supplies Fees: Last Two Days Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Reader Aid Committee of this newspaper, in order to remedy the deficiency of previously limiting donations and failing to increase the amount of aid, has decided to issue additional subsidies for books and supplies to aided students. From the 12th to the 24th of this month, thousands of aided students from elementary schools to junior and senior high schools to vocational colleges and universities have been able to collect them from the hall on time. However, there are still a small number of students who have not yet collected them, especially the second graders of senior elementary school. It is hoped that teachers from the various schools who have not collected them will urge the students to pay attention. Now, this office has stipulated that supplemental issues will be made this afternoon (29th and 30th) from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Overdue collections will be regarded as voluntary abandonment.</p>

<h3>Psychological Construction and National Construction: Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government's Radio Address</h3>
<p>The 30th marks the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. At the request of the Propaganda Department, Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government delivered a national radio address at 8:20 PM on the 28th, titled "Psychological Construction and National Construction." The address lasted for twenty minutes. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Two Means, One Goal</p>
<p>National construction is difficult; building a modern nation is especially difficult. Five years have passed since the National Government returned to Nanjing. After five years of effort, full peace has yet to be achieved. This is naturally a matter of great regret to every comrade who advocates peace. However, in these five years, the abolition of unequal treaties, a century-long aspiration of the Chinese people, and the recovery of concessions have been realized one by one. This means that the most important parts of Sun Yat-sen's will are being realized. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the late Chairman Wang has passed away, but Acting Chairman Chen inherits the late Chairman Wang's aspirations and leads us to continue moving forward. We will, of course, remain true to our original intention of serving the country and the nation with utmost dedication and strive forward in unison. Since the return to the capital, the late Chairman Wang has declared to China and the world the three major principles of "Peace," "Anti-Communism," and "National Construction." Peace is used to strive for China's freedom, anti-communism to achieve China's unification, and national construction to consolidate China's independence. It can also be said that peace and anti-communism are two necessary means, while national construction is the ultimate goal. By national construction, we mean, of course, to make China a modern nation, standing independently in the world.</p>
<p>Psychological Construction Must Be Completed</p>
<p>Since we are to make China a modern nation, looking back at the political and social realities of the past five years, we dare not deceive ourselves into thinking that we are satisfied. The communist bandits are still rampant, the people's livelihood is still so dire, corruption and malpractice have not been completely eradicated, and public opinion has still not been promptly conveyed. The reasons for these phenomena are still very complex. I believe that the most significant factor is the lack or weakness of a national construction mindset. After decades of advocating revolution, Sun Yat-sen retired and personally formulated the Outline of National Construction, lamenting the mistakes in the thinking of the revolutionaries, which hindered national construction and hampered the completion of the revolution. He resolutely made psychological construction the opening chapter of the Outline of National Construction. Reflecting on the present and thinking about the past, and recalling Sun Yat-sen's teachings, we deeply feel that psychological construction is the source and driving force of national construction. Without the completion of psychological construction, we can never cultivate healthy citizens, nor can we produce rational politics. In the case of Shanghai at this time and place, the domains poisoned and enslaved by the colonial policies of British and American imperialists for a century have resulted in a deformed society, and the psychology of the majority of citizens is inevitably deformed. This time, when I came to Shanghai with Mr. Zhou to take on local administrative work, Mr. Zhou told the citizens two sentences: "Society comes before the individual, and public interest outweighs private gain." The slogan I put forward is: "Make Shanghai a Chinese Shanghai." These are our basic requirements for psychological construction. For many days, the people of Shanghai have had the shadow of American troops landing in their minds. Some secretly rejoiced, some felt panicked, some tried to avoid it, and some wanted to take advantage of the situation. In short, they all start from a selfish point of view, forming various deformed mentalities.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Transform Deformed Mentalities</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally a paradise for adventurers, and Shanghai was originally a famous city of rumors. Deformed people and deformed mentalities create all kinds of deformed phenomena. I believe that it is necessary to take drastic measures to thoroughly transform them. Recently, I have heard many examples that demonstrate the deformed psychology of Shanghai people. Let me cite a couple of examples as proof: The owner of a certain shoe store told his clerk that he might as well sell all the imported shoes currently in the store at a low price. He said that the British and Americans would come soon and would surely bring many new styles and new goods, so shouldn't these old-fashioned stocks be cleared out as soon as possible? Also, some silk merchants, even when the price of silk was falling, were still unwilling to sell their stocks. Their reason was that silk is a very good export commodity for international trade, and they are waiting for their good days to come. I am afraid that there are not a few people who hold this kind of shallow, childish, and selfish view. War is sacred, and the nations participating in the war, and the citizens who obey the nation and engage in combat, must have a sacred sense of responsibility. The progress of the war is determined by the war leaders based on the requirements and application of strategy and policy. We cannot prove whether there is any war god in the dark, but I believe that the war god is just a messenger of the war leaders. Unfortunately, China has, on the one hand, the anti-Japanese camp under the British and American banner, and on the other hand, a participating group that is working with Japan. As citizens, they can lean to the left or the right according to their own will, and the authorities should not force them. However, taking the attitude of a third party, not fulfilling obligations, not taking responsibility, talking cynically, and only secretly doing selfish and self-serving things, that is the role of non-citizens, and this is not acceptable. Now that the god of war has descended upon us, escape is impossible, waiting for death is useless. Stand up, take responsibility, arm yourselves, and practice self-defense. This is the first priority.</p>
<p>Inspire the Public's Sense of Responsibility</p>
<p>Let us look at the Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima, who fought to the last man and perished together with a spirit that surpassed victory. This is because they shared a sacred sense of responsibility of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. National construction is difficult; building a modern nation is especially difficult. Today is the eve of the 72nd anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyrs of our Chinese Kuomintang. Recalling the heroic spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for righteousness, and reflecting on everyone's struggle in hardship, we deeply feel that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and national construction still requires effort. Those who survive are truly bound by limitless responsibility. We are determined to revive our country on this land and in these ruins. We must first cultivate a national construction mindset and inspire everyone's sacred sense of responsibility. This is the first lesson of psychological construction. Psychological construction increases by one point, and national construction succeeds by one point.</p>
