<h3>求中國自由解放盼國民加倍努力</h3>
<p>—陳代主席復興節之訓示—</p>
<p>南京一日中央社電　一日爲我國第二屆復興節，亦爲我國收回最後租界之紀念日，全國上下欣逢此在國民革命史上具有劃時代深長意義之節日，無不深爲感奮。國府於晨九時在國府大禮堂隆重舉行紀念典禮，各院部會文武長官均參加，陳代主席親臨主持，並剴切訓示，典禮迄十時許始畢。茲將陳代主席訓詞原文錄後：</p>
<p>今日爲復興節，也是中國收回最後租界的紀念日。前年的今日，中國收回上海公共租界和法租界，自此中國再沒有租界之名稱，是百年來中國的創舉，也是百年以來中國衰弱後復興的開始，所以定名爲復興節。</p>
<p>道義精神值得感謝</p>
<p>回憶國府參加大東亞戰發以後，日本首先自動交回專管租界，並承允撤廢治外法權，自是更協助國民政府收回使館區·鼓浪嶼·和上海公共租界，以及其他各國專管租界，并且撤廢辛丑駐兵條約。日本這種道義精神，我們是值得感謝的。我們是沒有所謂不平等條約了，中國是自由獨立了，我們環觀世界的現勢，以及遠矚中國的將來，今日我們還應該更加努力，更加發奮。</p>
<p>淬礪奮發應付危機</p>
<p>今天我要說的：第一，中國求自由獨立，算是名義上取得了，但如何保持中國的自由獨立，和發展中國的自由獨立，有待於我們進一步的努力。現在有許多人以爲時局緊迫至此，中國的前途是可憂慮的，我告訴各位，我也是憂慮之中的人，但我們憂慮的，不在時局的逼迫，而在於我們怎樣能够做一個眞精神愛國的國民。中國的衰弱不在於外國之壓迫，而在於我國民不能自立，不能奮發。在我看來，東亞的危機正方興未艾，而中國的危機也方興未艾，我們中國若不從做人作起點，求知識，守尊嚴，負責任，我們連僅有名義的自由獨立也不能保持，這是我們須深自憬式的。</p>
<p>黨不可分國須統一</p>
<p>第二，復興節的意義，是紀念中國復興，換一句話，是紀念中國的取得自由獨立。中國今日眞是自由獨立了嗎？凡國家自由獨立最大的要件，還在於國家的統一，中國現在還沒有實現全面和平，形成南京和重慶分立，不用說，就是南京國民政府的治下政治軍事經濟，都還沒有完全統一，以不統一的國家，而於國民之前說我們已經自由獨立，殊去事實太遠。我於去年十一月二十日曾倡導黨不可分，而國須統一，同時我更同情於本年春的人民代表大會發起統一救國運動，因此我再向全國國民要求，中國非統一不可，尤其南京治下無間南北，非先統一不可。我們不統一，無以集中力量，應付重要的時局，我們不統一，更不足言國家之獨立與自由。</p>
<p>堅定意志絕不動搖</p>
<p>時局的緊迫是不足懼的，也不足憂的，我們要求中國解放，是我們全體國民的權利，我們要求世界無殖民地，是我們最高的主張，我們無論在於何地，在於何時，成敗利鈍，絕不搖動我們的意志，也絕不中止我們的行動，敢以此義昭吿中國和東亞的人民</p>
<h3>渝行政院澈底改組</h3>
<p>廣州一日中央社電　據重慶廣播：渝行政院長宋子文開始澈底改組政院，除已任命國民黨宣傳部長王世杰爲外交部長（本由宋自兼）外，復罷免農林部長盛世才，着由社會部長谷正綱兼任，聞今後似尙有調動。據另一情報稱，政院各部長已提出總辭職，今後動向殊值注目。</p>
<h3>三巨頭舉行長時間會談</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據柏林消息：史太林元帥·特魯曼總統·阿特里首相·於今日在波次坦作三小時三十分鍾之會談，按此次會談實爲阿特里重赴波次坦後所舉行會談中之時間最長者。</p>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　據波次坦付出消息：史太林元帥於最近兩日來偶染小恙，雖稱病情決非嚴重，然一般醫師對比病之性質，一時均未能下診斷，現史氏遵醫囑，暫時杜門養息，然有客訪問，仍照例接見。按史太林元帥現年六十六歲，渠於七月十七至波次坦迄今，此次於週末舉行會談時，係由外長莫洛托夫代表出席，週一未舉行會談，目前對會談是否須予緩延，尙無官方消息透露。自阿特里首相於週六重赴波次坦後，在國巨頭僅作一次極短促之會談，換言之，自英國前首相邱吉爾返國而使會談中斷至今一無進展。茲英國新外相貝文自抵達波次坦後，照例與美蘇兩國外長彭斯莫洛托夫在週六週末舉行早晨會談</p>
<h3>石井康氏繼任日駐菲公使</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日駐菲島大使村田省藏，自菲國獨立以來，對於該國創國，協力殊多，茲已辭職。頃日內閣發表，由日駐泰國大使館參事官石井康氏爲駐菲公使，以繼村田之後。</p>
<h3>賴伐爾在奧北部遭美軍當局逮捕　移解至法駐軍司令部</h3>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　據此間獲訊：於廿四小時之謠傳空氣中，忽傳巴塞羅納來訊，賴伐爾所乘飛機已降抵義大利，忽又有其他各項不眞之消息，其說紛紜，致使法國警員中跋涉至各飛機塲，欲思逮捕賴伐爾而數度撲空。突來一官方消息略謂，前維希首長賴伐爾已在奧地利被當地美駐軍捉獲。昨夜法國新聞社引奧地利之美駐軍司令部消息稱，「賴伐爾偕同其妻子，於今日早晨飛抵林茲（Lnz）附近之霍興（Horsching）地區（奧地利北部）於抵達後，彼等即遭美軍當局逮捕，同時立即通知當地法駐軍司令部。至下午三時三十分，美軍第七十五軍司令官古柏萊，親自將賴伐爾移解至法軍司令部。</p>
<h3>日在滬報道機構弘報部昨成立　土田部長致訓勉屬員奮發</h3>
<p>日本在滬陸海外三報道機構，爲謀增進報道效率，强化報道陣容起見，決實行合併，設立上海弘報部，而使報道工作一元化，昨日上午十時舉行成立儀式，到川本陸軍部長，湊海軍武官長，上海警備隊司令官，憲兵隊司令官，總軍報道部長暨土田弘報部長，岸參事官，桑原大佐，勝野書記官，市川中佐，島田中佐，各班班長及全體工作人員等。行禮如儀後，首由土田部長致訓詞，闡明成立弘報部意義，旋由川本陸軍部長，湊海軍武官長先後致祝詞，儀式簡單隆重。</p>
<p>部長訓詞</p>
<p>日本政府爲謀政戰之一致，前將內閣情報局與大本營陸海軍報道部合併，以實現宣傳戰之一元化與積極化，幸報道能率，此種必要性，茲在現地亦感同樣重要，必須集中人力資材，予以充分活用，藉獲高度功效。尤其於上海，爲充分利用其爲宣傳基地的重要價值，又應以各機關統一之思想爲基礎，在簡素强力之陣容下，活潑推進思想戰。本日成立之弘報部，其　職即在於此。弘報部係合併素有傳統與經騐之軍官，報道機關組成，但須使此次合併，成爲有意義的，且能高度發揮能力率，第一必須得人和，望諸君在超非常戰時下，站於服務國家之立塲上，共舉總力。</p>
<p>宣傳之要諦，在以自己的思想使對方充分接受，且時時把握思想戰之自主性，此已母容　述。但爲獲得此效果，必須先洞察對方之心理，臨機應變，採取迅速適切之措置，吾人身爲報道宣傳戰士，先應確立自己的思想，堅持不動的信念，此爲第一要義。吾人應不屈不撓，抱必勝不敗信念，以身作則，啓發民衆。當此本部初創，望全體職員奮起精進，此次不才　弘報部長之重任，以學淺才菲，經騐又缺，竊憂來日能否完成此大任，尙幸宣傳連絡會議各位閣下之協力，總務室諸位之推進，暨各班同仁之奉公熱忱，本人決意站於國家存亡關頭，努力到底。</p>
<p>組織內容</p>
<p>該部組織及人事爲弘報部長土田公使，部長以下設總務室，由岸參事官，桑原大佐，勝野書記官，市川中佐，島田中佐等共同負責主持一切事務。總務室下設四班：第一班班長福間領事，掌理新聞·雜誌檢閱事宜；第二班班長松本大尉，掌理一切宣傳事宜；第三班班長森書記官，掌理有關資料等事宜。以外並將過去之陸海軍特報班予以合併，改爲弘報部特報班，由橫田擔任班長，此陣容堅强之報道機構，業於昨日起開始辦公，今後對於宣傳工作之展開，必可預期。</p>
<h3>对于上海特别市谘询委员会第二次报吿　周佛海</h3>
<p>今天在諮詢委員會，把市政府半年來的工作，加以大體的檢討，並略述個人的所感。</p>
<p>人事旣盡良心也安</p>
<p>在本人就職的時候，就請求上海市民說：「我希望大家對我不要有甚麼期待。沒有期待，將來便不會失望。期待越大，將來的失望就越甚。………在這樣的局勢，這樣的環境之下，就是三頭六臂的天神下凡，也決不會有辦法。」我又說「我們要做事，所以不能顧情面；我們不營私，所以過去歸私囊的不當利益，曾使之消滅或歸公。因此，我相信個人的情面沒有得尊重，個人的私利，沒有得繼續的人，一定會製造流言蜚語，或揑造事實來攻擊市府。現在時過半年，我的話不幸而言中了。因爲特價日益高漲，民生日益憔悴，過去對於市政的希望，漸漸變成失望了。因爲我們執法無私，實是求事，所以被裁撤，被處罰，以及請托而沒有得允許的人。漸漸的對市府也有不滿之聲了。但是這都是我們早已料到的事，決不是意外。所以我們決不因此氣餒，要不因此灰心，我們的良心，決不因此而受絲毫的譴責。第一，因爲我們雖然無功，却也無過，即使有些辦理不當的小事，也是公過，而非私圖。第二，上海現在的經濟情形，市政府決沒有視若無覩，不努力改善；尤其是這種情形，還是市政府所造成的。許多複雜的原因，造成上海今日的經濟現象，市政府雖然盡了最大的努力，但是力量不足，阻碍尤多，所以對於一般經濟現象沒有能够改善。不過對於其他計劃，可以說大部分，都已一一實現了。我們決沒有只說空話，不去實行。所以市政府同仁，人事旣盡，良心也可安了。今後仍舊要貫澈初衷，秉着「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」的公忠精神，不問成敗，不顧毀譽，祇知耕耘，不問收獲，通往直前的一直幹下去。</p>
<p>現在來檢討過去半年的工作情形。在第一次報吿中，我曾舉出上半年的中心工作，其中分市府內部整餓，和一般設施重點的兩部。</p>
<p>市府內部的整飭</p>
<p>關於市府內部的整飭，我又舉了縮小機構，裁汰冗員，勵行紀律，和提高待遇四項。這四項差不多都已實行了。縮小機構，最大的是工務公用兩局，及經濟局和物配處的合併，金庫的統一，以及各局處本身內部的簡單化。裁汰冗員，各局處名符其實的，都裁了三分之一左右。勵行紀律，我們對於不法的人員，查明有據的，免職的也有，處徒刑的也有，槍斃的也有。所以半年來，不敢說弊絕風淸，然而大的依法案件，卻沒有發生一件，但是唯其如此，唯其勵行了上述的三項，不僅是被裁被罰的人，就是關心市政的人以及站在傍邊專講風涼話的人，就異田同聲的，不說市府處置過火，便說市府操之過激。做這一點點不值一談的小改革，就要遭遇這些似是而非的所謂「與論」，所謂「淸議」的責難，怎麼呌人不於千古後爲王荊公·張江陵痛哭呢？至於提高待遇，我們算是已盡了全力了。提高待遇的速度趕不上物價高漲的速度，這是絕對沒有辦法救濟的。但是我們可以盡的力，都完全盡了。老實說，上海公務員和軍警的待遇，恐怕是最好的罷。七月份起，我們已實行再爲增加，不過其中最遺憾的，就是公務員的俸米，不能絕對的按期發給，至於軍警，則較一般公務員爲佳。但是我們也盡了最大努力去交涉，最近得松井司令官和土居參謀長的援助，軍警公務員的俸米，不致怎樣脫期。</p>
<p>本人在第一次報吿中，向各位先生提出的整飭市府內部的四項，托各位的福，都一一辦到了。市府同仁，關於這一點，對於各位先生，有了一個交代，對於市民，也可吿無罪了。</p>
<p>一般設施的檢討</p>
<p>其次，我們檢討一般的設施。其中又分整理財政·安定民生，誰持治安和改良封鎖管理處四項。</p>
<p>關於財政的管理，支出方面，我們採重點主義，減少甚至取消不必要的支出，至於絕對必要的經費我們毫不躊躇，都盡可能去籌措。這些事實，不必一一細舉。至於收入方面，增加得實在可觀。增加的原因，固然有許多，例如舉辦新稅，提高稅率，和隨着物價漲高的自然增收，但是因爲剔除中飽和消滅逃稅漏稅而增加的收入，却也不少。財政局因此，却得罪了不少的人。因爲法辦新稅和提高稅率，市民的負担，就不能不增加，因此對於市政府，也覺得不愉快。不過關於這一點，我們是沒有辦法使市民愉快的。以前市民都討厭警察沿途勒索，公務員敲詐索賄等事情。這種情形，現在可以說沒有了，至少可以說大大的減少了。本人德旣不足化人、威也不能服衆，怎麼會有這樣的情形？就是因爲待遇提高。要提高公務員軍警的待遇，我們不能點石成金，除却增加市民的負担外，還有甚麼辦法？我們只要取之於民，用之於民，我們只要涓滴歸公、市民就是埋怨、我們良心却不受譴責。諮詢委員中我的一位最要好的朋友問我說：「市府的收入，增加得不少，所以還要提高稅率，增加新稅，我們相信當局的人，決不會中飽，但是想來想去，想不出何以要這些錢的理由。是否有不得已的特殊用途呢？」這種很善意的推測，尙且覺得錢收得太多，其他惡意或莫名其妙的評論，就可想而知了。關於這一點，財政局另外有詳細的報吿，現在不必多說。我這裏要提出的，就是我們在第一次報吿中所預定的整理財政，不能不說是有了相當的成績。</p>
<p>關於維持治安，在現在這樣民不聊生，時局嚴重，人心動搖的時候，我們預料治安情形，一定要加速度的惡化，但是出乎意料之外的，治安雖然沒有顯著的改善，至少還沒有怎樣大的惡化。我們現在正盡全力整飭軍警的紀律，并且充實其實力，加强其訓練，使其能於嚴重時期，完全其維持治安之任務。</p>
<p>安定民生阻力甚大</p>
<p>至於改良封鎖管理處，各位大慨都已知道，總處已根本撤消了。散在各鄉的檢問所的人員，亦已分期裁撤。過去鄉民入市，重重被剝削的情形，不敢說完全消滅，至少已去了十分之七八。這也是可以吿慰於各位的。</p>
<p>自己感覺得對各位沒有交代，更無以對市民的，就是安定民生這一點是極不容易的。所以在第一次報吿的時候就說：「這個任務能達到幾成，自己一點都沒有把握。又說：「市政府當局縱然有一顆赤心，實在只是一雙空手。一顆赤心，一雙空手，要能壓低物價，要能充分而按期的配給，除非有點石成金的本事，就是神仙也沒有辦法。」話雖如此說，但是我們還是盡十二分的努力，想於不可爲之中，多多少少能使民生稍得安定。那曉得經濟情形，竟這樣惡化得這樣快！於是也有寫信來埋怨市府的，也有當面或北後責難市府的。市民受了生活的痛苦，沒有地方可訴，只得埋怨市府，這是理所當然，我們應該被埋怨的；知名之士，看着現狀焦心，而責難市府，我們也樂於接受。不過市府當局，不是麻木不仁，對於現狀，並不是絲毫沒有認識；也不是喪盡天良，視若無覩，而不努力去謀救濟。　看市府重要幕僚及經濟方面的各幹部，那一個不是東交涉，西接洽，早開會討論，晚草擬方案，一天到晚忙得頭昏眼花？那一個曾經混水摸魚，想利用經濟情形的不安，而撈一筆冤枉錢？但是儘管你努力，儘管你不舞弊，而安定民生的阻力，實在太大了，大得不可抗。這種不可抗的阻力，由於許多內在的和外在的原因造成的。這些複雜的原因，不單是區區市政府的力量，沒有法子去消除，就是拿整個國民政府的力量，也是無可如何。如果大家把這些原因，這些阻力，去研究，去分析一下，恐怕對於市府，只有同情，而不忍心去埋怨了。不過市府同仁，並不希望各方的同情，我們在各方埋怨和責難之下，鼓着愚公移山，精衛塡海的愚忠愚勇，一點一滴，一絲一毫的對於物資的供應，物價的調節等方面去努力，希望對於民生安定多少有點貢獻。但是這個事業，如果不得市民，尤其是各界領袖切切實實的有力的協助，依然是不會成功的。</p>
<p>以上是根據第一次報吿，對於半年來的工作，向各位先生，加以客觀的總檢討。至於其他各問題，另外各有報吿，此地不必詳述。希望各位先生予以指敎。</p>
<p>官民一致同心協力</p>
<p>今後時局愈益嚴重，上海的處境愈益困難，市府與市民的全面合作，更加需要。上海百年以來，沒有直接受過戰禍。太平天國軍的迫近上海，民國以來迭次的內戰，乃至中日事變，上海都以租界爲護符，絲毫沒有嘗過戰爭的滋味。就是大東亞戰爭發生以後，上海也不過只受着經濟困窮，生活壓迫等戰爭的間接影響，至於破壞，焚燒，毀滅，死亡，等戰爭直接的威力，百年來一次都沒有經騐過。但是現在，命運却注定上海市民，不能不經騐這個悲慘的生活了。如果上海變成了爭奪的目標，變成了決戰的塲所，那更不必說，就是像前幾次的空襲，繼續不斷，也就够受了。所以今後市府的工作，恐怕要集中於救死扶傷，和維持治安。突襲的時候，傷的如何醫治，死的如何葬埋，無家可歸的如何收容，都是必需做，而極不容易做的事。突襲時因秩序混亂，必然發生搶刦或暴動，如何去防止，如何去鎭壓，也是必需做而極不易做的事。而且要做這兩件事，必然要經費，然而在秩序混亂之中，市民逃生不暇，還有甚麼稅收？要做的事越難，而做事所必需的經費越無所出，工作的困難可想而知。這種困難，不在將來，就在目前了。上海這種空前的浩刦，我們怎樣去避免，去減輕呢？這是市府之責，同時也是市民之責。市府同仁，無論如何，在職一日，必定盡一日之責，一日之力，在萬難之中，站在市民的最前綫，做上海搶救的工作。希望今後無論是政府機關與機關之間，社會團體與團體之間，以及市府與市民之間，都不要互相推諉，互相責難，大家如能秉着見義勇爲，當仁不記的精神，同心協力，一致去做搶救的工作，那末，快將降臨上海浩刧，或可減少幾成。</p>

<p>代論</p>
<h3>轉變上海風氣</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>今天本報發表兩篇文字，一是周兼市長關於一般市政的報吿，一是羅兼局長關於財政的報吿，都是在昨天市政諮詢會席上報吿的，希望每個市民都應細心的一讀，因爲這些絕不能以官樣文章眼光看待的。</p>
<p>昨天諮詢會席上在市長等個別報吿之後，開始討論議程之前，我曾要求主席給我一個發言的機會，現在把當時所說的以及補充的話寫在下面：</p>
<p>周市長希望上海一切的工作，必須官民共同擔負，尤其在目前時局緊張之際，尤須上下一致，肩此重任。現在我對於市府設施方面的話暫緩說明，先就民間方面究竟有多少力量？究竟協力到怎樣的程度？應該先加以深切坦白的反省。</p>
<p>首先舉幾個實例說吧，站在民間方面的立塲，實在覺得慚愧，幾於無容身之地。</p>
<p>第一件，去年春間，市民福利協會協助舉辦警察消費合作社墊借資金一事。當時警察當局爲改善警察待遇，設立合作社，擬向民間墊借資金一萬萬元，結果遷延數月，僅及十分之四，當時一般人認爲墊借等於捐款，故存觀望推諉態度，現在當局已經按照本利悉數償還，這在當初墊款者所認爲出乎意外的。我們對於當局重視信用，表示感謝以外，更足爲今後辦理社會事業的一種保證，尤爲欣慰。而一方面，我們追憶籌款當時，正當空頭企業公司蓬勃時代，以十元一股的招募股份，一二星期間即可成立數萬萬資本的公司，而爲協助維護治安改善警察待遇的公益事業，竟如此吝嗇，個人利益先於社會利益的暴利主義，實在令人寒心，而顯示民間力量的何等脆弱！</p>
<p>第二件，今年三月間市府發行救濟庫券十五萬萬元，其中十萬萬元彌補去年配給米差額，由市府籌集，其餘五萬萬元，包括救濟疏散特別治安費等用途，分由各同業公會攤派認定，而迄今數月，尙未募足，僅有三萬七千萬元，當時到塲商討攤認辦法時，允予認募者都是各業公會的負責人士，而不顧信義不顧公益，一味延諉，迄未繳齊。這又充分顯示民間力量何等脆弱！</p>
<p>第三件，最近舉辦的江蘇產米區農貸五十萬萬元，這是最有意義的工作，誰都不能否認的，可是，從五月初旬開始募集，以迄七月下旬，歷兩月之久，籌集不及三十萬萬元，不得已與江蘇省當局商減爲三十萬萬元，其餘二十萬萬元作爲將來第二期辦理。然而，我們還要問，在這三十萬萬元中，民間究竟實際認募若干？我爲了保留上海人的顏面，暫時不欲說穿。回想我與金雄白先生共同訪問本市某同業公會的領袖某君，爲商談籌募貸金，我們首先說明農貸意義及將來以米抵債辦法以後，他就發問說：「辦法很好，可是到了新榖登塲時的時局怎樣，你們能否保證呢？」他的意思就是說：「天快亮了，你們何必多此一舉。」可是，我們沉着氣再解釋，這次中儲竭力協助，可以貼現三分之二，實際上只須墊借三分之一，還請贊助。他又說道：「這樣說來，不是我們向中儲行負了一筆債了，你們知道，重慶曾頒布命令，凡與中儲發生債務關係的，將受嚴厲處分。」并且說了一套農民不需貸款的理論，經過反覆討論後，始允召開同業會議決定，隔了幾天，召開同業會議，並邀約我們列席說明，我們準時前往，說明後退席，可是，直到今天，旣不說參加，又不說不參加，杳無聲息。我們爲了舉辦農貨，曾訪問與農業增產最有關係之雜糧業，麵粉業，紗廠業領袖，而直到今天的結果，還是似應非應，然而，出乎意外的，與農業增產毫無關係的捲烟業，却担負了六千萬元貸款，特業公會担負了五千萬元。所以，在每次訪問以後，惟有相互歎氣而已。可是，這次農貨工作固然失敗了，而中儲當局及復興銀行，暨諮詢會委員李思浩朱博泉兩先生的出力，則不可否認的。我們聽說這般吝嗇之輩，非但不吃雜糧，而且不吃糙米，必須吃上好白米，而竟對於供給白米的農民如此冷淡，所以，有人說，上海這一般人應使餓死，從這些地方看來，並不是過激之詞吧！</p>
<p>除了這些實例以外，上海五百萬市民中，至少有五分之一，直接或間接的依靠投機爲生，例如在金條股票貼現套利等等投機中討生活，這些投機者，何曾想到上海目前和未來的危機呢？何曾想到以自己一分的力量，協助當局解除危機呢？</p>
<p>還有最無恥的一部分人，表面上都是社會領導人物，他們口頭上對於和平區內，一切政治工作社會工作都不理睬的，態度很爲消極的，而他們却最會利用政治上經濟上的隙縫，作利己利私的勾當，這種私的態度却又很積極了。</p>
<p>我希望在座的諮詢會前輩，共同促成轉變風氣工作，上海的風氣已經浸透在個人先於社會，私利重於公益的氣氛中，所以，要求上海危機的克服，非先把風氣轉變不可，而轉變風氣，尤必先給上面所舉的一般人，作無情的打擊，我們必須站在最前綫與若輩搏鬥，風氣才有轉變希望，社會危機才有克服希望。</p>
<p>其次，對於市政措施方面，雖不能說十分成功，但十之八可說有成績的，尤其是因財政整頓的收效而改善軍警公務人員待遇，爲革新政治的先聲，這點非常滿意，而且絕對擁護。雖然，一部分人以爲稅收加重，增加市民負担，這種聲浪未始無聞，可是，讀了財政報吿（丙）項，就可證明並未加重市民負担。況且，從是加重市民負担，只要取之於民，用之於民，雖有加重之事實亦屬無妨。上海工商界一部分人總是要減稅，然而他們却忘記了自身的股票價值，從票面十元的漲到了幾千幾萬元了，是怎樣的倍數，所以，這輩人的要求，實是市　的要求，而不是市民的要求。</p>
<p>市長說到過去數月行政設施不免稍嫌過火，然而，我認爲上海是需要强力政治的，惟有强力政治，才可以克服一切不合理的困難，不爲人家所輕視，所以，我以爲不但不過火，而且還是不够過火呢！</p>

<h3>昨二屆復興節全市熱烈慶祝　各機關團體舉行慶祝式</h3>
<p>昨日爲第二屆中華復興節，並爲團府收回上海租界二週年紀念日，市府特于上午十時在禮堂舉紀念大會，各團體於下午五時半在大光明電影院聯合舉行民衆慶祝大會，全市遍懸國旗，各馬路縣掛紅布跨街慶祝標語，市府所屬各縣區，則在常地舉行慶祝儀式，戲院娛樂塲，一律半似，各公園亦全日開放，供市民免費遊　，同伸慶祝。</p>

<h3>汪鵬先生捐一萬萬元　創本屆最高紀錄</h3>
<p>本屆助學金勸募目標，是三萬萬元，經過我們大聲疾呼了一個月，才及三分之一，眞使我們着急了。因爲籌款不足，就是助學不成，我們的工作失敗不足惜，整幾千的延　渴望的清寒學子　不成書，却是國家社會的致命傷，這才是值得可惜的。可是，根據歷届的經騐，我們總是堅定最後成功的信念。因爲雖則大部份有錢有力者只圖一己享用，吝於公益，而還有小部份有遠見的有力有錢者，總會滿足莘莘學子求學的願望的。我們在沒有絕望的時候·總是這得想，這樣的望</p>
<p>果然，有識見的熱心者決不會使社會失望的。昨天承蒙汪鵬先生以一萬萬元認捐榮譽隊，打破我們這次勸募的最高紀錄，不讓凈名堂主人隊及寒風集隊專美於前。而且，汪先生同時捐助新聞報貸學金一萬萬元，及新普育堂普善山莊合一萬萬元，一次以三萬萬元慨捐，眞可以說空前之舉了。我們一方面以最大至誠代表本報受助學生向汪先生表示敬謝之意。另方面，我們也以至誠向資力雄厚的富商們進言，發揮熱心公益的本性，媲美汪氏，不讓專美於前，那末，社會公益，何事不舉呢？</p>

<h3>上海特別市財政局半年來工作實施概況</h3>
<p>— 羅君強</p>
<p>查本市財務行政，因過去租界存在關係，各有其沿用之制度，租界收回以後，形式上雖已趨於一元化，但在財政制度方面，尚未徹底加以調整，所有征課系統，收支系統，主計系統，均未能確立與統一，此種不統一之情形，由於歷史上之傳統，地域上之習慣，與國際間之外交等關係，形成中外不同之制度，一旦驅予調整，使成爲　素化單一化系統化，原非易事。舉例言之，如就征課系統方面言，關於稅制之採用，征收方法之訂定·經征機構之樹立，財務行政政人員之管制。就主計系統方面言，關於預算之編制與程序，決算支審核與報告，會計報告之記載與整理，計政監督之事前事後審計，暨稽察事項。就收支系統方面言，關於收支統一與出納保管之程序等等問題，各　財政制度，各有不同，情形互異，自未可拘執辦理。本市財政，在此中外複雜之情形下，而欲以單一之財務機構，並選擇適當之稅制，運用統一之征收方法。求能適用於全市各部分，行之而無阻，自屬艱難萬狀，成功不易，此種特殊困難情形，在我國任何地方，殊所罕見。但法有常規，物有定理，半年以來，本市財政制度，經參照當地之實際情形，基於於學理上之探討，與積極之努力，業已綱舉目張，規模粗具，所謂聯綜組織之財政制度，已具有雛形，循途徑，邁力以赴，或本難計日成功，期於盡善也。謹將半年來之設施實况，及困難問題之意見，分述如下：</p>
<h3>（甲）關於稅制之整理</h3>
<p>田賦改征實物及催征歷年欠賦本市自三十四年起田賦征收實物·惟征實在本市尙屬創舉·經詳密硏討，擬具實施方索，呈奉核定，分爲第一·二兩期征收，全年應征額爲四十一萬六千三百三十三石，第一期依照規定應征十分之三，本市及縣原非產米之區，又値靑黃不接之時，各縣因部署費時，延至六月間次第開征，爲顧全實際情形起見，米麥兼收，並以收小麥四十斤合米一斗計算爲標準，現各縣征起米麥，已有相當數量，陸續運儲於南區指定之倉庫內。</p>
<p>本市各縣三十三年度以前欠賦爲數尙鉅，經擬具催追欠賦辦法，派員分往各縣催逍，成績亦尙良好。</p>
<p>接辦市區契稅　市區契稅原由地政局辦理，自五月份起，依照中央契稅條例規定劃歸財局接辦，以一事權，藉符規定·稅頗爲暢旺。</p>
<p>開征舊一八兩區營業稅　本市在舊市區及各縣營業稅，早經舉辦，惟第一八兩區，因租界關係，迄未開征，自租界實行收回後，亦延未舉辦，市民負擔，殊欠公允，經積極籌備，本年春季營業稅，於四月一日實行啓征，並就舊一八兩區內分設六個稽征處，辦理征稅事宜，商民尙能遵章報繳，夏季營業我，亦於六月十日繼續開征。</p>
<p>消費特稅稅率之修正及稅收之整頓　物品零售消費特稅普通物品稅率原爲百分之四，爲平衡市庫收支起見，經中央核准附加一厘，共爲百分之五，自本年二月一日起實行，至奢侈物品稅率，原爲百分之三十，因與實際情形未盡相合，經呈請修正爲百分之十五，又筵席旅館消費特稅係按累進稅率征收，易使商人逃稅，亦經呈准，改爲一律按百分之三十征收，飯攤及小客棧減征百分之十，並將罰金自五千元增高至五萬元。自四月二千日起實行，至整頓方面加派員實施查帳征稅，厲行發票制度，補辦商號登記，嚴厲取締公務員軍警抗稅，實行猪牛肉就傷集中征稅，暨捲　於出廠時設會代征，均有成效。</p>
<p>關整執照費率　本市推行執照制度，因種類繁多，名目不一，收費亦瓦有高低，頗爲紊亂，且所收照費，均係數年前所規定，與實際情形，相差縣殊，經分別詳加調整，重予訂定費率，呈准施行，並變更派員收費辦法，改由商號自行依限繳，藉袪積弊。</p>
<p>整頓娛樂捐收入本市過去娛樂捐，收數甚微，由於各娛樂塲所逃避不征，或代征以後侵佔不繳，流弊至深，經嚴密訂定漏捐處罰辦法，並每日分派人員，認眞調查，嚴格處罰，各娛樂塲所均能遵章辦理，並據實報繳捐款，收入激增，所有旣往逃捐之風，亦一掃而空。</p>
<p>調整房地捐捐率　本市在舊一八兩區過去時代辦理市政，以房地捐爲大宗收入，賴以挹注，惟近年以來，捐率並未調整，原定捐額，過於低微，且舊一八兩區扣率高低不齊，市民負輕重不一，因自夏季起將本市各區房捐，一律依照二十六年所訂定房租估價標準所征收之房捐，升按原數之二百五十倍，捐率仍照二十六年百分之四十計算，於五月二十五日先就舊一八兩區內征收，至舊市區部分，亦經依照是項標準訂定辦法，先後實行開征，至地捐方面，因去年十月十六日接收舊市區滬南閘北洋涇法華引翔浦淞等去，年租地價稅及本年三月底將　八區地捐接受，合併辦理後，關於地捐之征收，已吿統一，並以原有地捐名稱，未盡適合，改稱地價稅，惟各區土地估價均係個別擬訂以致價格相巨甚鉅，地價稅之徵收，殊欠公允，經參酌實際地價情形，並按照各縣田賦征實標準，擬具征收地價稅辦法，實施征收，藉使負扒平衡，充裕市庫。</p>
<p>黃金特稅之開征本市黃金買賣交易，異常旺盛，是項交易，非投機之徒，從中漁利，即係暴發之戶，購藏保產，經呈准中央開征黃金特稅，稅率爲千分之五，由買賣雙方各半負担，並組織黃金特稅代征委員會負責代征，所有經營黃金買賣之商號先經申請登記，審查合格者，計一百五十家，指定五十家負代征特稅之責，其中四家，因違反功令撤銷其代征資格，勒令停業，其餘一百家則附屬於四十六家營業，以便易於管理，防止逃稅，一面由登記合格之商號，自行組織同業公會，是項特稅，自七月五日開征以來，迄三十日止，已征起五十餘萬萬元，規定先提百分之五爲一切開支及獎金之用，再以四分之一解繳中央，四分之三撥入市庫。</p>
<h3>（乙）關於機構之調整</h3>
<p>計政之統一本市計政制度，三十一年七月間，設有總會計處，專司其事，該處內部組織，不以堂管之事務性質分設各科，乃以辦理「舊一區」「舊八區」「舊市區」之會計事項而分科，成爲各自獨立之狀態，未能施行聯綜組織，採取內部牽制制度，以致全市預算及會計帳冊，均分爲「舊一區」「舊八區」「舊市區」三部分，收支各自獨立，而各部分之新津待遇，亦有厚薄之差別，因於二月一日，將總會計處裁撤，所有該處經辦事務，歸併財政局，改設主計科，統一辦理，分設歲計會計審核（事前審　與時候審計）稽察四股。</p>
<p>金庫之合併　本市現金出納，名義上原設有市金庫，綜理其事，但實際內部機構，則係劉分區域，分別辦理，因是收支系統，未能確立，如「集市金庫」由復興銀行總行經辦「舊八區」金庫由復興銀行南區支行代理，「市金庫」本身僅司舊一區部份之收支，以致收付紛歧，稽核困難，爰於二月一日起，將以上各金庫經辦之業務，統行合併於財政局新設之金庫科辦理，所有市縣郊各區稅收，概憑解款書逕解金庫科，各機關請領經臨各費，亦由金庫科依據支付命令直培撥付，金庫系統，因以確定。</p>
<p>組織之調整　爲厲行行政簡素化增加工作效能起見，經將組織予以調整，分述如下：　二月一日將原有房捐第損估價催查四科，合併爲房地捐科，估目職務歸入房地捐科內，設股辦理，至催查工作，則由房地捐科及其他有關人員分別負責。　舊八孤以內各項捐稅原由馬常路辦事處征收，自一月二十二日起，將消費特稅部份，合併於消費特稅科辦理，復於四月一日起將該馬當路辦事處裁撤，所有該處經征各項捐稅，依其性質，分別劃歸各主管科　續辦理。　消費特稅處組織畸形，規模龐大，因於二月一日改爲消費特稅科。　過去之賦稅科，係屬主管舊市區與各縣之田賦，及各項捐稅，自租界收回後，迄未加以釐正，因於二月一日，將賦稅科所經管之田賦契程沙田淸理事務成立田賦科，專責辦理，復將賦稅科主管之舊市區及各縣營業稅，成立營業稅科，劃歸辦理，並由該科負責籌備開征舊一八兩區之營業稅。至賦稅科所主管之其他執照費車船捐等，則分別劃歸各主管科辦理，征收行政臻於統一。　烟酒牌照稅稽征處與竹本營業專稅稽征處，均以征數無多，經先後予以裁撤，所有烟酒牌照稅停征後，改征營業稅，竹木營業專稅停征後，改由牙行向販運竹木柴炭之客戶代征營業稅，組織雖裁撤，而稅收則不受影響。　爲實行廉潔政治防止財務行政人員之舞弊起見，已於二月一日成立監察科，對一般財務行政人員執行職務時，能否奉公守法，監察科人員，均可隨時調查，如查有營私舞弊暨其他不法情事，可予以檢舉，並有立予逮捕之權。自監察科成立以來，各在職人員，尙知儆惕策勵，忠於職務，弊雖未絕，風或可淸，是監察科之設立，於健全財務行政之組織，發揮廉潔政治之精神，不無裨益。</p>
<h3>（丙）收支状况與市民之負擔</h3>
<p>本市各項捐稅經積極整理後，收入在表面上數字按月增加，在黃金特稅未開征以前，大宗收入爲消費特稅，收入最高紀錄爲七月份，計五十三萬萬七千餘萬元，其中約有百分之四十以上，須解財部，市庫所得，僅二十餘萬萬元。其他收入，雖有增加，或以捐稅率並未變更（如娛樂捐營業等稅從量征收等），或以捐率雖變更而收入不能如預期之增加，（如房捐因受空製關係暨外僑欠捐等等），不免使整個收入發生影饗，而支出方面，無論薪津及辦公費，常須增加，各項臨時支出，亦因物價高漲，無不隨之激增，尤以應付戰時各項臨時必需支出，實屬急不容緩減無可減，祗能勉爲支付。收支不能平衡，在戰時體制下，爲任何財政機關所不能避免之現象，茲將半年來收支狀况，另行列表載明。</p>
<p>據本市研究室之報告，二十五年本市舊第一區市民，每月平均負担捐稅爲一元七角六分，三十四年六月間，本市市民每月平均負担捐稅爲一千二百三十五元五角二分，如以民二十五年爲一零零，則本年六月間市民負擔捐稅指數爲七萬零二百，即較戰前上升七百零一倍，惟在事變前，租界以內並無營業稅，全市並未舉辦消費特稅，故在戰後各項捐稅率之增加，實際遠不及七百零一倍之多，即增加最多之房捐，亦僅較二十六年按原數升爲二百五十倍，但物價指數，本年六月間，較二十五年已上升至二萬四千餘倍，足證本市市民負擔，較前並未增加，實際上負祖反較戰前爲減矣。</p>
<h3>（丁）困難問題之意見</h3>
<p>本市及各縣田畝額爲四百五十二萬三千三百四十五萬畝，本年田賦征實，分上三下七，全年應征米額四十一萬六千三百三十三石强，參照過去征賦情形，全年實征額，平均僅占六成，惟征度較征賦在技術方而本較困難，加以米價日見高漲，農民自不願繳米，須再以九折估計，可征二十三萬三千零九十二石，此外征獲之米，因運輸及虧耗及提成經費等，平均須折耗一成半，凈獲僅及十九萬八千一百二十八石，但全市市郊縣各區駐軍警保公務員敎員工役等配給俸米每月需米三萬五千石左右，全年需米三十萬石，不敷在三分之一强，必須另行採購補足，米價隨時有上漲之可能，此項　額支出，一時實無法估計。</p>
<p>消費特稅營業稅與黃金特稅雖因物價高漲，稅收有增加可能，但商號帳册，均不完備，且有正副兩種帳册，又以售價超出限價，商人畏懼處罰，多不登載帳册，因之應征之稅多被逃去，或已征而被侵佔，調查頗感困難，甚至尙有一部分商人，不明納稅爲人民應盡之義務，反以滅稅逃稅爲榮，多方請托，希　取巧，又以上各稅，因空製關係，營業淸淡，稅收隨時有滅短之可能。</p>
<p>各商號申請領用各種執照，依照向例，須將副本送各局處審查，經認爲合格后，方可發照，倘各局處未能迅速辦理，善良商人，則發生懷疑，以爲必須行使賄賂，狡黠者則無照先行營業，有損政府威信，故各局處間必須密切聯繫，共同採取迅速有效之方法。</p>
<p>過去舊市區與　一八兩區各有其不同之會計制度，本年編製整個與統一之概算，以無所準繩，收集資料，頗感困難，優良之預算，在於事前審愼編製，事後始可收支平衡，惟目前物價日見高漲，收入方面，殊難任意增加，而支出方面，則因支用　繁，無可節省，收支差額，日見懸殊，無法平衡，加以時局已趨入於嚴重之階段，以後物價仍須昂騰，各機關之支出，事實上必須膨脹，爲適應戰時需要之各項事業，如築路工程，防空設施經費等，固屬無法減少，因空襲之救濟醫療撫卹等費，亦不能不預爲籌措，此後支出之數額，勢必鉅大，且屬無可　節，下半年度本市公務員之待遇，照中央規定辦法，提高甚鉅，並以本市物價之高，冠於各地，特於戰時津貼以外，另加地方生活津貼，此項支出數額，雖甚鉅大，但每一公務員所得，衡諸目前生活指數而論、亦僅能維持一二人最低之生活，將來物價再漲，則此增加之薪津，又將不數甚遠，公務人員欲其奉公守法，則必須給予最低之生活費用，但負財政責任者，對此種最基本最小限度之要求，履行亦殊匪易，在此戰時狀態之下，財政方面，開源旣有限度，節流不僅不可能，且須隨時籌措必要之經費，以備緊急之支付坐年以來，所遭遇之困難情形，深感度日如年應付不易，今後所遭逢之困難，將必超過於上半年度遠甚，所幸市民實際負擔輕於戰前，今後賢明之市民，定能瞭解本市財政實際困難情形，而予以全面之協力，固司其事者之大幸也。</p>

<h3>Hoping for China's Freedom and Liberation, Urging the People to Redouble Their Efforts</h3>
<p>—Instructions from Acting Chairman Chen on Restoration Day—</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The 1st is our country's Second Restoration Day, and also the anniversary of our country's recovery of the last concession. The entire nation is happily celebrating this festival, which has profound and epoch-making significance in the history of the national revolution, and is deeply inspired. The National Government solemnly held a commemorative ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM. All senior civil and military officials from various departments and committees attended. Acting Chairman Chen personally presided over the ceremony and gave earnest instructions. The ceremony concluded at approximately 10:00 AM. The original text of Acting Chairman Chen's instructions is recorded below:</p>
<p>Today is Restoration Day, and also the anniversary of China's recovery of the last concession. On this day two years ago, China recovered the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Since then, China no longer has the name of concession. This is a pioneering achievement for China in a century, and also the beginning of China's restoration after a century of decline. Therefore, it is named Restoration Day.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Righteousness Deserves Gratitude</p>
<p>Recalling that after the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War, Japan first automatically returned the exclusive concessions and promised to abolish extraterritoriality. It then assisted the National Government in recovering the Legation Quarter, Gulangyu, the Shanghai International Settlement, and other countries' exclusive concessions, and abolished the Boxer Protocol stationing of troops. This spirit of righteousness from Japan deserves our gratitude. We no longer have so-called unequal treaties, and China is free and independent. Looking around at the current situation in the world and looking forward to the future of China, today we should work harder and be more determined.</p>
<p>Tempering Ourselves and Facing the Crisis</p>
<p>What I want to say today is: First, China's pursuit of freedom and independence has nominally been achieved, but how to maintain China's freedom and independence and develop China's freedom and independence requires further efforts from us. Now many people think that the current situation is so urgent that China's future is worrying. I tell you, everyone, I am also among those who are worried, but what we are worried about is not the pressure of the current situation, but how we can be a truly patriotic citizen in spirit. China's weakness is not due to foreign oppression, but to the inability of our people to be self-reliant and determined. In my opinion, the crisis in East Asia is just beginning, and the crisis in China is also just beginning. If we Chinese do not start with being good people, seeking knowledge, upholding dignity, and taking responsibility, we cannot even maintain the nominal freedom and independence we have. This is something we must deeply reflect on.</p>
<p>The Party Must Not Be Divided, the Country Must Be United</p>
<p>Second, the meaning of Restoration Day is to commemorate China's restoration, in other words, to commemorate China's achievement of freedom and independence. Is China truly free and independent today? The most important condition for a country's freedom and independence is still the country's unification. China has not yet achieved complete peace, forming the division between Nanjing and Chongqing. Needless to say, even the political, military, and economic aspects under the rule of the Nanjing National Government are not completely unified. It is too far from reality to say to the people of a disunited country that we are already free and independent. On November 20th of last year, I advocated that the party must not be divided, and the country must be unified. At the same time, I sympathize with the People's Representative Assembly's call for a unified national salvation movement this spring. Therefore, I once again ask the people of the whole country, China must be unified, especially Nanjing's rule, regardless of north and south, must be unified first. If we are not unified, we cannot concentrate our strength to deal with the important current situation. If we are not unified, we cannot talk about national independence and freedom.</p>
<p>Firm Determination, Never Wavering</p>
<p>The urgency of the current situation is not to be feared, nor is it to be worried about. Our demand for China's liberation is the right of all our people. Our demand for a world without colonies is our highest advocacy. No matter where we are, no matter when, whether successful or defeated, we will never waver in our determination, nor will we ever stop our actions. Dare to proclaim this meaning to the people of China and East Asia.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Executive Yuan Thoroughly Reorganized</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing Broadcasting: Chongqing Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen has begun a thorough reorganization of the Executive Yuan. In addition to appointing Kuomintang Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie as Minister of Foreign Affairs (formerly held concurrently by Song), he has also dismissed Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Sheng Shicai, to be concurrently held by Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang. It is said that there may be further changes in the future. According to another report, the ministers of the Executive Yuan have submitted their collective resignation, and future developments are worth noting.</p>
<h3>The Big Three Hold Long Meeting</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to Berlin sources: Marshal Stalin, President Truman, and Prime Minister Attlee held a three-hour and thirty-minute meeting in Potsdam today. This meeting was the longest of the meetings held since Attlee's return to Potsdam.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to news from Potsdam: Marshal Stalin has been slightly ill for the past two days. Although it is said that the condition is not serious, doctors have not yet been able to diagnose the nature of the illness. Stalin is currently following his doctor's advice and resting at home temporarily, but still receives visitors as usual. Marshal Stalin is currently 66 years old. Since arriving in Potsdam on July 17th, Foreign Minister Molotov attended the weekend meeting on his behalf. No meeting was held on Monday. There is currently no official news on whether the meeting needs to be postponed. Since Prime Minister Attlee's return to Potsdam on Saturday, the heads of state have only held one very short meeting. In other words, since former British Prime Minister Churchill returned home and the meeting was interrupted, there has been no progress. Since the new British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived in Potsdam, he has held morning meetings with the US and Soviet Foreign Ministers Burns and Molotov on Saturday and Sunday as usual.</p>
<h3>Yasushi Ishii Appointed as Japanese Minister to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines, Shozo Murata, has contributed greatly to the establishment of the country since the independence of the Philippines and has now resigned. The Japanese Cabinet announced that Yasushi Ishii, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, will be appointed as Minister to the Philippines to succeed Murata.</p>
<h3>Laval Arrested by US Military Authorities in Northern Austria, Transferred to French Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to information obtained here: After 24 hours of rumors, news suddenly came from Barcelona that the plane Laval was on had landed in Italy. Then there were other false reports, causing French police officers to rush to various airfields, hoping to arrest Laval, but failing several times. Suddenly, an official message stated that former Vichy leader Laval had been captured by the local US garrison in Austria. Last night, Agence France-Presse quoted the headquarters of the US garrison in Austria as saying, "Laval and his wife arrived this morning in the Horsching area (northern Austria) near Linz (Lnz). Upon arrival, they were arrested by the US military authorities, and the local French garrison headquarters was immediately notified. At 3:30 PM, US 75th Corps Commander Cooper personally transferred Laval to the French military headquarters."</p>
<h3>Japanese Reporting Agency in Shanghai, Propaganda Department, Established Yesterday, Department Head Tsuchida Instructs Staff to Strive Hard</h3>
<p>In order to improve reporting efficiency and strengthen the reporting lineup, the three Japanese reporting agencies in Shanghai, the Army, Navy, and Overseas, decided to merge and establish the Shanghai Propaganda Department, making reporting work unified. The establishment ceremony was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Army Minister Kawamoto, Naval Attache Minato, the commander of the Shanghai Garrison, the commander of the Kempeitai, the chief of the General Army's reporting department, Department Head Tsuchida of the Propaganda Department, Councilor Kishi, Colonel Kuwahara, Secretary Katsuno, Lieutenant Colonel Ichikawa, Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, section chiefs, and all staff members. After the ceremony, Department Head Tsuchida gave an instruction, explaining the meaning of the establishment of the Propaganda Department. Then, Army Minister Kawamoto and Naval Attache Minato delivered congratulatory speeches in succession. The ceremony was simple and solemn.</p>
<p>Department Head's Instruction</p>
<p>In order to achieve consistency in political warfare, the Japanese government previously merged the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau with the Army and Navy Reporting Departments of the General Headquarters to realize the unification and activeization of propaganda warfare, hoping to improve reporting efficiency. This kind of necessity is also felt to be equally important locally. Human resources and materials must be concentrated and fully utilized to obtain high effectiveness. Especially in Shanghai, in order to fully utilize its important value as a propaganda base, and based on the unified thinking of various agencies, ideological warfare should be vigorously promoted with a simple and powerful lineup. The establishment of the Propaganda Department today is for this purpose. The Propaganda Department is composed of officers and reporting agencies with tradition and experience, but this merger must be meaningful and able to highly exert its capabilities. First, it must be harmonious. I hope that everyone will stand in the position of serving the country in the midst of this extraordinary wartime and work together with all our strength.</p>
<p>The key to propaganda is to make the other party fully accept your own ideas, and to always grasp the autonomy of ideological warfare. This is self-evident. But in order to achieve this effect, you must first understand the other party's psychology, adapt to the situation, and take prompt and appropriate measures. We, as soldiers of reporting and propaganda warfare, should first establish our own ideas and adhere to unwavering beliefs. This is the first essential. We should be indomitable, hold the belief of certain victory and invincibility, and set an example to enlighten the people. At the beginning of this department's creation, I hope that all staff members will rise up and strive diligently. This humble person has taken on the heavy responsibility of Department Head of the Propaganda Department, and I am worried about whether I will be able to complete this great task in the future due to my shallow learning, limited talent, and lack of experience. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the honorable members of the Propaganda Liaison Conference, the promotion of the General Affairs Office, and the dedication of colleagues in all sections, I am determined to stand at the critical moment of the country's survival and work hard to the end.</p>
<p>Organizational Content</p>
<p>The organization and personnel of the department are: Propaganda Department Head: Minister Tsuchida. Under the department head is the General Affairs Office, which is jointly responsible for presiding over all affairs by Councilor Kishi, Colonel Kuwahara, Secretary Katsuno, Lieutenant Colonel Ichikawa, and Lieutenant Colonel Shimada. Under the General Affairs Office are four sections: Section Chief of the First Section: Consul Fukuma, in charge of news and magazine review; Section Chief of the Second Section: Captain Matsumoto, in charge of all propaganda matters; Section Chief of the Third Section: Secretary Mori, in charge of matters related to materials, etc. In addition, the former Army and Navy Special Reporting Sections will be merged and renamed the Special Reporting Section of the Propaganda Department, with Yokota as the section chief. This strong reporting agency officially began operations yesterday, and the development of propaganda work can be expected in the future.</p>
<h3>On the Second Report of the Shanghai Special Municipality Advisory Committee - Zhou Fo Hai</h3>
<p>Today, at the Advisory Committee, we broadly reviewed the work of the Municipal Government over the past six months and briefly expressed my personal feelings.</p>
<p>Conscience is at Peace After Doing Our Best</p>
<p>When I took office, I asked the citizens of Shanghai, "I hope everyone doesn't have too many expectations of me. Without expectations, there will be no disappointment in the future. The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment in the future... In such a situation, under such circumstances, even a deity with three heads and six arms descending to earth would not have a solution." I also said, "We must be impartial in our work; we must not be self-serving. Therefore, improper profits that previously went into private pockets have been eliminated or returned to the public. As a result, I believe those whose personal relationships have not been respected and whose personal interests have not been continued will definitely create rumors or fabricate facts to attack the Municipal Government." Now, half a year has passed, and unfortunately, my words have come true. Because prices are rising, people's livelihoods are becoming more and more difficult, and past hopes for the municipality are gradually turning into disappointment. Because we enforce the law impartially and seek to get things done, those who have been dismissed, punished, or whose requests have not been granted are gradually voicing their dissatisfaction with the Municipal Government. But these are all things we had already anticipated and are by no means unexpected. Therefore, we will never be discouraged or disheartened because of this, and our conscience will not be condemned in the slightest. Firstly, although we have made no great achievements, we have also made no major mistakes. Even if there are some small things that are handled improperly, they are mistakes made in the public interest, not for personal gain. Secondly, the Municipal Government is by no means unaware of Shanghai's current economic situation and is not neglecting to improve it; especially since this situation was created by the Municipal Government itself. Many complex reasons have created Shanghai's current economic phenomenon. Although the Municipal Government has made its greatest efforts, its strength is insufficient, and there are too many obstacles, so it has not been able to improve the general economic situation. However, most of the other plans have been implemented one by one. We have never just talked the talk without walking the walk. Therefore, the colleagues in the Municipal Government have done their best, and their conscience is at peace. In the future, we must still implement our original intentions, adhering to the spirit of "public interest is more important than private interest, society comes before the individual," regardless of success or failure, regardless of praise or criticism, just knowing how to cultivate, not asking about the harvest, and moving forward straight ahead.</p>
<p>Now, let's review the work situation over the past six months. In the first report, I cited the central tasks of the first half of the year, which were divided into two parts: internal rectification of the Municipal Government and key general facilities.</p>
<p>Internal Rectification of the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Regarding the internal rectification of the Municipal Government, I cited four items: reducing the size of the organization, dismissing redundant personnel, enforcing discipline, and increasing salaries. These four items have been almost fully implemented. The largest reductions in the size of the organization were the merging of the Bureau of Public Works and Utilities, the Bureau of Economic Affairs and the Material Allocation Office, the unification of the treasury, and the simplification of the internal structures of various bureaus and offices themselves. In terms of dismissing redundant personnel, each bureau and office has, in fact, dismissed about one-third of their staff. In terms of enforcing discipline, we have investigated and verified illegal personnel, and some have been dismissed, some have been sentenced to imprisonment, and some have been executed. Therefore, in the past six months, I dare not say that all abuses have been eliminated, but at least no major legal cases have occurred. But precisely because of this, precisely because the above three items have been implemented, not only those who have been dismissed and punished, but also those who care about municipal administration and those who stand by and make sarcastic remarks, have unanimously said that the Municipal Government's actions are excessive or too drastic. To encounter such specious so-called "public opinion" and so-called "criticism" for doing this little, insignificant reform, how can one not weep for Wang Anshi and Zhang Juzheng of a thousand years later? As for increasing salaries, we have done our best. The speed of increasing salaries cannot keep up with the speed of rising prices, and there is absolutely no way to remedy this. But we have done everything we can. Honestly, the salaries of Shanghai civil servants and military police are probably the best. Starting in July, we have implemented further increases, but the most regrettable thing is that the rice rations for civil servants cannot be issued absolutely on time. As for the military police, they are better off than ordinary civil servants. But we have also made our greatest efforts to negotiate. Recently, with the assistance of Commander Matsui and Chief of Staff Doi, the rice rations for military police and civil servants will not be delayed too much.</p>
<p>In the first report, I presented the four items of internal rectification of the Municipal Government to all of you. Thanks to all of you, they have all been accomplished one by one. The colleagues in the Municipal Government, regarding this point, have given an account to all of you and can plead innocent to the citizens.</p>
<p>Review of General Facilities</p>
<p>Secondly, let's review the general facilities. These can be further divided into four items: reorganizing finances, stabilizing people's livelihoods, maintaining public security, and improving the Blockade Management Office.</p>
<p>Regarding financial management, on the expenditure side, we adopt the principle of prioritizing key areas, reducing or even eliminating unnecessary expenditures. As for absolutely necessary expenses, we do not hesitate and try our best to raise funds. These facts do not need to be listed in detail one by one. As for the income side, the increase is indeed considerable. There are many reasons for the increase, such as introducing new taxes, raising tax rates, and the natural increase in revenue due to rising prices. However, the increased revenue due to eliminating embezzlement and eliminating tax evasion is also significant. As a result, the Finance Bureau has offended many people. Because of the legal imposition of new taxes and the increase in tax rates, the burden on citizens cannot but increase, so they also feel unhappy with the Municipal Government. However, regarding this point, there is no way for us to make the citizens happy. In the past, citizens disliked the police extorting along the way and civil servants extorting bribes. This situation can now be said to be gone, or at least greatly reduced. My virtue is insufficient to transform people, and my power cannot subdue the masses. How could this happen? It is because salaries have been increased. To increase the salaries of civil servants and military police, we cannot turn stones into gold. What other way is there besides increasing the burden on citizens? As long as we take from the people and use it for the people, as long as we dedicate every drop to the public, even if the citizens complain, our conscience will not be condemned. One of my best friends among the advisory committee members asked me, "The Municipal Government's income has increased a lot, so why do you still have to raise tax rates and add new taxes? We believe that the authorities will definitely not embezzle, but after thinking about it, we can't figure out the reason for needing this money. Are there any unavoidable special uses?" Even this very well-intentioned speculation feels that too much money has been collected. One can imagine the other malicious or inexplicable comments. Regarding this point, the Finance Bureau has a separate detailed report, so I don't need to say more now. What I want to point out here is that the financial reorganization we planned in the first report cannot be said to have achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Regarding maintaining public security, in these times when people's livelihoods are difficult, the situation is serious, and people's hearts are shaken, we expected the public security situation to deteriorate at an accelerated rate. But unexpectedly, although public security has not significantly improved, at least it has not deteriorated much. We are now doing our best to rectify the discipline of the military police and to strengthen their strength and training so that they can fully fulfill their mission of maintaining public security during serious times.</p>
<p>Stabilizing People's Livelihoods Faces Great Resistance</p>
<p>As for improving the Blockade Management Office, you probably all know that the general office has been completely abolished. The personnel in the inspection stations scattered in various rural areas have also been dismissed in stages. The situation where villagers entering the city were heavily exploited in the past, I dare not say has been completely eliminated, but at least seven or eight out of ten have been eliminated. This is also something that can be reported to you with comfort.</p>
<p>What I feel I have not been able to account for to you, and even more so to the citizens, is that stabilizing people's livelihoods is extremely difficult. Therefore, in the first report, I said, "I have no confidence in how much of this task can be achieved." I also said, "Even if the Municipal Government authorities have a sincere heart, they really only have empty hands. With a sincere heart and empty hands, to be able to lower prices and to be able to allocate fully and on time, unless you have the ability to turn stones into gold, even a deity has no way." Having said that, we still made our best efforts, hoping to stabilize people's livelihoods somewhat in the midst of the impossible. Who knew that the economic situation would deteriorate so quickly! As a result, some people wrote letters complaining about the Municipal Government, and some people criticized the Municipal Government face to face or behind its back. It is only natural that citizens who have suffered from the hardships of life have nowhere to turn but to complain about the Municipal Government. We should be complained about. We are also happy to accept the criticisms of prominent figures who are anxious about the current situation and criticize the Municipal Government. However, the Municipal Government authorities are not numb and indifferent, and they are not unaware of the current situation in the slightest. Nor are they devoid of conscience, turning a blind eye and not trying to seek relief. Look at the important staff members of the Municipal Government and the various economic cadres. Which one is not negotiating east and west, holding meetings to discuss early in the morning and drafting plans late at night, and being busy from morning till night until they are dizzy? Which one has ever muddied the waters, wanting to take advantage of the economic situation to make a windfall? But no matter how hard you try, no matter how much you don't cheat, the resistance to stabilizing people's livelihoods is really too great, too great to resist. This irresistible resistance is caused by many internal and external reasons. These complex reasons are not something that the Municipal Government alone can eliminate, nor can the entire National Government do anything about it. If everyone studies and analyzes these reasons, these resistances, I am afraid that they will only sympathize with the Municipal Government and will not bear to complain. However, the colleagues in the Municipal Government do not hope for sympathy from all sides. Under the complaints and criticisms from all sides, we are encouraged by the foolish loyalty and courage of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountain and Jingwei Filling the Sea, making every effort, bit by bit, to supply materials and adjust prices, hoping to contribute somewhat to the stabilization of people's livelihoods. However, this cause will not succeed unless it receives the practical and powerful assistance of the citizens, especially the leaders of all sectors.</p>
<p>The above is a general and objective review of the work of the past six months for all of you, based on the first report. As for other issues, there are separate reports, so I don't need to elaborate here. I hope all of you will give your guidance.</p>
<p>Officials and People Working Together with One Heart</p>
<p>In the future, the situation will become more and more serious, and Shanghai's situation will become more and more difficult. The full cooperation between the Municipal Government and the citizens is even more necessary. For a hundred years, Shanghai has not directly suffered from the ravages of war. The approach of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army to Shanghai, the repeated civil wars since the Republic of China, and even the Sino-Japanese Incident, Shanghai has used the concessions as a talisman and has not tasted the flavor of war in the slightest. Even after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has only suffered the indirect effects of war, such as economic poverty and pressure on life. As for the direct power of war, such as destruction, burning, destruction, and death, it has never been experienced once in a hundred years. But now, fate has destined the citizens of Shanghai to experience this tragic life. If Shanghai becomes the target of contention and becomes the place of decisive battle, then it goes without saying. Even if the air raids of the past few times continue, it will be enough to suffer. Therefore, in the future, the work of the Municipal Government will probably focus on saving the dying and helping the wounded, and maintaining public security. How to treat the wounded and bury the dead in the event of a sudden attack, and how to shelter those who have lost their homes, are all things that must be done and are extremely difficult to do. During a sudden attack, looting or riots will inevitably occur due to the chaos in order. How to prevent and suppress them is also something that must be done and is extremely difficult to do. Moreover, to do these two things, expenses are inevitable. However, in the midst of chaos, citizens are too busy escaping for their lives. What taxes are there to collect? The more difficult things are to do, the more difficult it is to get the funds necessary to do them. The difficulty of the work can be imagined. This kind of difficulty is not in the future, it is in the present. How can we avoid or reduce this unprecedented catastrophe in Shanghai? This is the responsibility of the Municipal Government, and it is also the responsibility of the citizens. No matter what, the colleagues in the Municipal Government will definitely fulfill their responsibility and strength for one day while they are in office, and stand on the front line of the citizens in the midst of all difficulties to do the work of rescuing Shanghai. I hope that in the future, whether it is between government agencies and agencies, between social organizations and organizations, and between the Municipal Government and the citizens, we will not shirk responsibility or blame each other. If everyone can adhere to the spirit of acting bravely for righteousness and not remembering the sacrifice, and work together with one heart to do the work of rescue, then the impending catastrophe in Shanghai may be reduced by several degrees.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Transforming Shanghai's Atmosphere - Chen Bin He</h3>
<p>Today, our newspaper publishes two articles, one is the report on general municipal administration by Mayor Zhou, and the other is the report on finance by Director Luo. Both were reported at yesterday's municipal advisory meeting. I hope that every citizen should read them carefully because these should never be regarded as mere formal documents.</p>
<p>At yesterday's advisory meeting, after the individual reports by the mayor and others, before starting the discussion of the agenda, I asked the chairman to give me an opportunity to speak. Now I will write down what I said at the time and the supplements below:</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou hopes that all the work in Shanghai must be jointly undertaken by officials and people, especially in the current tense situation, it is especially necessary to be united from top to bottom and shoulder this heavy responsibility. Now I will postpone explaining my views on the municipal facilities and first deeply and frankly reflect on how much strength the people have and to what extent they are cooperating.</p>
<p>First of all, let me give a few examples. Standing on the side of the people, I really feel ashamed and almost have no place to stand.</p>
<p>The first thing is the matter of the Citizens' Welfare Association assisting in providing loan funds for the Police Consumer Cooperative last spring. At that time, the police authorities established a cooperative to improve the treatment of the police and planned to borrow 100 million yuan of funds from the people. As a result, after several months of delay, only four-tenths of the funds were raised. At that time, most people thought that borrowing was equivalent to donating, so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude and shirked responsibility. Now the authorities have repaid all the principal and interest, which was unexpected by those who made the initial loans. We express our gratitude to the authorities for valuing credit and are even more pleased that this provides a guarantee for future social undertakings. On the other hand, we recall that at the time of fundraising, it was the heyday of speculative enterprises. Companies with a capital of tens of millions of yuan could be established in one or two weeks by recruiting shares at ten yuan each. However, for public welfare undertakings to assist in maintaining public order and improving police treatment, they were so stingy. The profiteering of putting personal interests before social interests is really chilling and shows how weak the strength of the people is!</p>
<p>The second thing is that the Municipal Government issued 150 million yuan of relief treasury bonds in March this year, of which 100 million yuan was used to make up for the shortfall in rice distribution last year and was raised by the Municipal Government. The remaining 50 million yuan, including relief, evacuation, and special security expenses, was allocated and determined by various trade associations. However, several months have passed and the funds have not been fully raised. Only 37 million yuan has been raised. At that time, those who attended the meeting to discuss the allocation and fundraising methods were all responsible people from various trade associations. However, they disregarded good faith and public welfare and shirked responsibility, and have not yet paid in full. This fully shows how weak the strength of the people is!</p>
<p>The third thing is the 500 million yuan agricultural loan for the Jiangsu rice-producing area that was recently organized. This is the most meaningful work, and no one can deny it. However, starting from early May and lasting until late July, it took two months to raise less than 300 million yuan. The authorities had no choice but to discuss with the Jiangsu Provincial authorities to reduce it to 300 million yuan, and the remaining 200 million yuan will be used for the second phase in the future. However, we still have to ask, how much of these 300 million yuan was actually raised by the people? In order to save the face of the people of Shanghai, I don't want to reveal it for the time being. Recalling that Mr. Jin Xiong Bai and I jointly visited Mr. So-and-so, the leader of a certain trade association in this city, to discuss fundraising loans, we first explained the significance of agricultural loans and the method of repaying debts with rice in the future. Then he asked, "The method is very good, but what will the situation be when the new grain is harvested? Can you guarantee it?" What he meant was, "Day is about to dawn, why bother?" However, we calmly explained again that the Central Reserve Bank is making every effort to assist and can discount two-thirds, and in fact only one-third needs to be borrowed. Please sponsor us. He also said, "In this case, isn't it that we owe a debt to the Central Reserve Bank? You know, Chongqing has issued an order that anyone who has a debt relationship with the Central Reserve Bank will be severely punished." He also said a set of theories that farmers do not need loans. After repeated discussions, he finally agreed to convene a trade association meeting to decide. A few days later, a trade association meeting was convened and we were invited to attend to explain. We went on time, explained, and withdrew. However, to this day, they have not said whether to participate or not to participate, and there is no news. In order to organize agricultural loans, we visited the leaders of the grain, flour, and yarn industries, who are most closely related to agricultural production increase, but the result to this day is still uncertain. However, unexpectedly, the cigarette industry, which has nothing to do with agricultural production increase, has undertaken 60 million yuan of loans, and the special industry association has undertaken 50 million yuan. Therefore, after each visit, we can only sigh at each other. However, although this agricultural loan work has failed, the efforts of the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank and the Fuxing Bank, as well as the two members of the Advisory Committee, Mr. Li Si Hao and Mr. Zhu Bo Quan, cannot be denied. We have heard that these stingy people not only do not eat coarse grains, but also do not eat brown rice. They must eat the best white rice, but they are so indifferent to the farmers who supply white rice. Therefore, some people say that these people in Shanghai should be starved to death. Judging from these points, isn't it an extreme statement!</p>
<p>In addition to these examples, at least one-fifth of the five million citizens of Shanghai directly or indirectly rely on speculation to make a living. For example, they make a living by speculating in gold bars, stocks, discounts, arbitrage, etc. Have these speculators ever thought about the current and future crisis in Shanghai? Have they ever thought about assisting the authorities to resolve the crisis with their own strength?</p>
<p>There is also the most shameless group of people who are all social leaders on the surface. They say that they don't care about any political and social work in the peaceful area, and their attitude is very negative. However, they are the best at using political and economic loopholes to do things for their own benefit and their attitude to that is very active.</p>
<p>I hope that the senior members of the Advisory Committee present will jointly promote the work of transforming the atmosphere. The atmosphere in Shanghai has been permeated with the atmosphere of personal interest before society and private interest over public interest. Therefore, to overcome the Shanghai crisis, we must first transform the atmosphere, and to transform the atmosphere, we must first give the general public mentioned above a merciless blow. We must stand on the front line and fight against these people before there is hope of transforming the atmosphere and overcoming the social crisis.</p>
<p>Secondly, although the municipal measures cannot be said to be completely successful, eight out of ten can be said to have achieved results. In particular, improving the treatment of military police and civil servants due to the effectiveness of financial rectification is a prelude to political reform, and I am very satisfied with this point and absolutely support it. Although some people think that the tax increase has increased the burden on citizens, this kind of voice is not unheard of. However, reading item (C) of the financial report will prove that it has not increased the burden on citizens. Moreover, even if it does increase the burden on citizens, as long as it is taken from the people and used for the people, even if there is an increase in fact, it is harmless. Some people in Shanghai's business community always want to reduce taxes, but they forget that the value of their own stocks has increased from the face value of ten yuan to several thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. What is the multiple? Therefore, the demands of these people are actually the demands of stock owners, not the demands of the citizens.</p>
<p>The mayor said that the administrative measures in the past few months may have been a bit excessive. However, I believe that Shanghai needs strong politics. Only strong politics can overcome all unreasonable difficulties and not be underestimated by others. Therefore, I believe that it is not only not excessive, but also not excessive enough!</p>

Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, and the heads of various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government all attended in person. The meeting was chaired by Li Si Hao.</p>
<h3>Report Items</h3>
<p>Municipal Report, Mayor Zhou (original text published separately) Municipal Finance Bureau's Report on Work in Recent Years - Director Luo Cong (original text published separately) The Process and Overview of the Establishment of the Municipal Food Adjustment Committee - Chen Bin He Overview of the Work of the Municipal Population Evacuation Committee (written) The Process of Organizing Agricultural Loans in Jiangsu Province - Jin Xiong Bai Overview of Air Raid Relief and Rescue in this City:</p>
<p>1. Municipal Government side - Deputy Secretary-General Hu</p>
<p>2. Civilian side (written)</p>
<h3>Discussion Items</h3>
<p>Proposal to Implement a City-Wide Grain Reserve Plan</p>
<p>Reason: In these extraordinary times, the storage of food for urban residents is of utmost importance. The city should have at least one month's worth of food reserves to meet unforeseen needs.</p>
<p>Methods: 1. The types of food should include rice, flour, and all kinds of coarse grains. 2. Utilize the Baojia system; each Bao should set up a public grain storage site, the quantity of which should be determined by the size of the population. 3. The expenses for grain storage should be raised independently by each Bao; the wealthy should bear more responsibility, contributing either money or grain.</p>
<p>Resolution: Forwarded to the Civil Food Regulation Committee for study. Proposal for Special Compensation for Civil Servants Who Die in Air Raids.</p>
<p>Reason: Families of firefighters, civil defense corps members, medical rescue workers, etc., who die in the line of duty during air raids should receive special compensation as an incentive.</p>
<p>Methods: Although the municipal government has explicit regulations, the amount is too small. The funds designated by the Civil Welfare Association should be fully distributed as maintenance fees according to the number of family members.</p>
<p>Resolution: To be handled through consultation between the municipal government and the Civil Welfare Association. Proposal for Mandatory Evacuation of Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the City.</p>
<p>Reason: Primary and secondary schools in major cities of the countries at war have all been evacuated to safe areas first. However, most primary and secondary schools in this city have not yet been evacuated. The Municipal Education Bureau should be asked to prepare a detailed evacuation plan.</p>
<p>Methods: 1. At least half of the primary and secondary schools must be evacuated before the start of the next semester.</p>
<p>2. The school buildings after evacuation will be used as air raid refugee shelters or hospitals.</p>
<p>Resolution: To be studied and handled by the Municipal Education Bureau.</p>
<p>Proposal to Requisition Bedding from Hotels to Replenish Equipment for Air Raid Relief Hospitals.</p>
<p>Reason: The equipment of public and private hospitals in this city is usually insufficient to meet the needs of temporary relief. With frequent air raids expected in the future, preparations should be made in advance.</p>
<p>Methods: During the first phase, approximately one thousand sets of mattresses and bedding should be requisitioned evenly from various hotels to meet the temporary needs of air raid hospitals.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Towaki Memorial Service to be Held Regularly</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Towaki of Japan died of illness on July 20th. During his lifetime, he served as a military attaché in Nanjing, the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the China Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and a Councilor of the Cabinet General Planning Bureau. He devoted much effort to adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. His sudden death has caused great shock and sorrow to those who advocate Sino-Japanese friendship. To commemorate his virtue, a memorial service will be held at the Nishihonganji Temple on Zha Pu Road at 4:30 PM on August 4th. Friends of Lieutenant General Towaki are requested to attend.</p>
<h3>The Second Restoration Festival was Celebrated Enthusiastically Throughout the City Yesterday; Various Agencies and Organizations Held Celebratory Ceremonies.</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Second Chinese Restoration Festival and the second anniversary of the Nationalist Government's recovery of the Shanghai Concessions. The Municipal Government held a commemorative assembly in the auditorium at 10:00 AM. Various organizations jointly held a public celebration assembly at the Grand Theatre at 5:30 PM in the afternoon. National flags were hung throughout the city, and red banners with celebratory slogans were hung across the streets on various roads. The counties and districts under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government held celebration ceremonies in their respective locations. Theaters and entertainment venues were all closed for half a day as a sign of respect, and all parks were open all day for citizens to visit and celebrate together for free.</p>
<h3>Five Organizations in this City Celebrate the Restoration Festival</h3>
<p>Five organizations in this city, including the Municipal Civil Welfare Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Association, the China National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Shanghai Branch of the China Journalists Association, held a public assembly for the Restoration Festival at the Grand Theatre at 5:30 PM yesterday. Mr. Gu Sencheng, the Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department, was invited to give a speech. Many people from all walks of life in this city attended the meeting to listen to the speech. The presidium consisted of Yuan Ludeng, Wen Yiduo, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou (represented by Hu Shouqi), and Chen Bin (represented by Chen Riping). The meeting started on time. After the audience sang the national anthem, they paid the highest respect to the national flag. Then, the chairman of the presidium, Yuan Ludeng, delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of celebrating the Restoration Festival. Afterwards, Director Gu gave a speech, which lasted for an hour. Finally, a famous film "National Treasure" produced by China Film was screened.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Peng Donates 10,000,000 Yuan, Setting a New Record for this Year</h3>
<p>The fundraising goal for this year's student aid fund is 30,000,000 yuan. After a month of our vigorous appeals, we have only reached one-third of the goal, which is truly worrying. Because insufficient funds mean no student aid, and it is not a pity if our work fails, but it is a fatal blow to the country and society that several thousand aspiring poor students cannot study, which is truly regrettable. However, based on past experience, we always firmly believe in eventual success. Because although most wealthy and powerful people only seek personal enjoyment and are stingy with public welfare, there are still a small number of far-sighted and wealthy people who will always fulfill the students' desire for education. When we are not desperate, we always think this way, with such hope.</p>
<p>Indeed, knowledgeable and enthusiastic people will never disappoint society. Yesterday, thanks to Mr. Wang Peng's honorary donation of 10,000,000 yuan, breaking our highest fundraising record this time, not letting the Jìngmíngtáng Owner Team and Hánfēng Team monopolize the lead. Moreover, Mr. Wang also donated 10,000,000 yuan to the News Daily student loan fund, and another 10,000,000 yuan to the Xinpu Yutang Pushan Villa, generously donating 30,000,000 yuan at once, which can truly be said to be an unprecedented move. On the one hand, we express our most sincere gratitude to Mr. Wang on behalf of the students who have received assistance from this newspaper. On the other hand, we also sincerely urge wealthy merchants with strong financial resources to display their enthusiasm for public welfare, emulate Mr. Wang, and not allow him to monopolize the lead. In that case, what public welfare cause cannot be achieved?</p>
<p>Honor Teams</p>
<p>Thirty-fourth Team: Wang Peng Team Thirty-fifth Team: Gaoge Team</p>
<p>The above collected a total of 10,100,000 yuan, bringing the total to 17,540,000 yuan. One hundred and thirty-eighth Team: Wei Ji Team: 500,000 yuan One hundred and thirty-ninth Team: Madam Ying Yong Wang Scholarship Fund Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and fortieth Team: Chun He Yong Wool Fabric Store Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-first Team: Hong Jingtao Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-second Team: Yan Qinglu Xinyou Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-third Team: Yan Qinglu Personal Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-fourth Team: Hua Xinfang Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-fifth Team: Xiao Xigeng Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-sixth Team: Zhang Zihua Team: 100,000 yuan One hundred and forty-seventh Team: Cao Renyu Team: 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Ordinary Teams</p>
<p>The above collected a total of 1,400,000 yuan, bringing the total to 25,992,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Setting a Target for the Gift to Mr. Huang Jingwan, Hoping to Conclude it Soon</h3>
<p>Previously, this office believed that Mr. Huang Jingwan had served the society for more than 30 years, was enthusiastic and friendly, and made many contributions. However, he did not accumulate wealth in his daily life and was truly in a state of having only clean sleeves. Recently, he was also suffering from illness and experiencing extreme hardship. The colleagues in this office believe that since Mr. Huang has dedicated himself to serving society, society should also lend a helping hand to him in this predicament, to show justice and public opinion. We appealed to Mr. Huang's relatives and friends for assistance. We are grateful for the generous assistance from all walks of life, whether acquainted or not, who have shown unanimous sympathy. We have now collected more than 8,000,000 yuan, and we plan to set a target of 10,000,000 yuan. We will also work with Mr. Huang to properly plan the use of the funds so that he can live in peace. We still hope to continue to receive assistance so that we can reach the target as soon as possible and bring this matter to a conclusion.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Work Implemented by the Shanghai Special Municipality Bureau of Finance in the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>— Luo Junqiang</p>
<p>Upon examination, the financial administration of this city has had its own systems due to the existence of concessions in the past. After the recovery of the concessions, although the form has tended towards unification, the financial system has not been thoroughly adjusted. All collection systems, revenue and expenditure systems, and accounting systems have not been established and unified. This kind of non-unification is due to historical traditions, regional customs, and international diplomatic relations, forming different systems between China and foreign countries. Once adjusted, it is not easy to make it a standardized, unified, and systematic one. For example, in terms of the collection system, the adoption of the tax system, the formulation of collection methods, the establishment of collection agencies, and the control of financial administrative personnel; in terms of the accounting system, the preparation and procedures of the budget, the review and reporting of the final accounts, the recording and sorting of accounting reports, the pre- and post-audits of accounting supervision, and inspection matters; in terms of the revenue and expenditure system, the unification of revenue and expenditure and the procedures for cash receipt, disbursement, and safekeeping, etc. The financial systems of each government are different, and the situations are different, so they cannot be handled rigidly. The finance of this city, under these complex Chinese and foreign circumstances, wants to use a single financial agency, and choose an appropriate tax system, and use a unified collection method. It is able to apply to all parts of the city, and is carried out without obstruction, which is naturally difficult and success is not easy. This special and difficult situation is rare in any place in our country. However, there are regular rules for laws, and there are fixed principles for things. In the past six months, the financial system of this city has been based on the actual situation of the area, based on the exploration of academic theories and active efforts, and has already had a rough framework. In the so-called integrated financial system, a prototype has already been formed. If we follow the path and work hard, it will be difficult to succeed in a short period of time, and we hope to do our best. The facilities, the actual situation, and the opinions on difficult problems in the past six months are described below:</p>
<h3>(A) On the Organization of the Tax System</h3>
<p>Changing the Land Tax to Collect Actual Goods and Expediting the Collection of Past-Due Taxes: Since the 34th year, this city has levied land tax in kind. However, the collection of actual goods is still a new initiative in this city. After detailed research and discussion, an implementation plan was drafted and submitted for approval. It was divided into two phases for collection. The total amount to be collected for the year was 416,333 stones. The first phase should be collected according to the regulations, accounting for three-tenths of the total. The city and counties were originally not rice-producing areas, and it was also the time of year when the old grain had been depleted and the new grain had not yet come in. Because the deployment of each county took time, the collection was delayed until June. In order to take into account the actual situation, both rice and wheat were collected, and the standard was calculated as 40 catties of wheat equal to 1 dou of rice. At present, the rice and wheat collected by each county have reached a considerable quantity and are being transported and stored in the designated warehouses in the southern district.</p>
<p>The amount of arrears in the city's counties before the 33rd year is still large. Measures have been formulated to urge the recovery of arrears, and personnel have been sent to each county to expedite the collection. The results are also good.</p>
<p>Taking Over the Deed Tax in the Urban Area: The deed tax in the urban area was originally handled by the Land Administration Bureau. Since May, in accordance with the regulations of the central deed tax regulations, it has been transferred to the Finance Bureau for unified authority to comply with regulations. The tax is quite prosperous.</p>
<p>Opening the Business Tax in the Old One and Eight Districts: Business tax in the old urban area and various counties of this city has long been implemented. However, the first eight districts have not been levied due to concession relations. After the implementation of the recovery of the concession, it has been delayed. The burden on the citizens is unfair. After active preparations, the spring business tax this year was implemented on April 1, and six tax collection offices were set up in the old one and eight districts to handle tax collection matters. Merchants are still able to report and pay in accordance with regulations. The summer business tax was also continued to be levied on June 10.</p>
<p>Revision of the Consumption Special Tax Rate and Rectification of Tax Revenue: The ordinary goods tax rate of the retail consumption special tax was originally 4%. In order to balance the income and expenditure of the municipal treasury, it was approved by the central government to add 1%, for a total of 5%. It has been implemented since February 1 this year. As for the tax rate on luxury goods, it was originally 30%. Because it did not fully conform to the actual situation, it was submitted for amendment to 15%. Also, the special tax on banquets and hotels is levied according to progressive tax rates, which makes it easy for merchants to evade taxes. It has also been submitted for approval to be changed to a uniform 30%. Street stalls and small inns are reduced by 10%, and the fine is increased from 5,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. It has been implemented since April 2. In terms of rectification, additional personnel have been assigned to implement tax collection through account checking, strictly implement the invoice system, re-register merchants, strictly prohibit civil servants and military police from resisting taxes, implement centralized tax collection on pork and beef, and set up a meeting to collect taxes on cigarettes at the time of leaving the factory. All have been effective.</p>
<p>Regulating License Fee Rates: The implementation of the license system in this city has many types, different names, and varying fees, which are quite chaotic. Moreover, the license fees collected are all stipulated a few years ago, which is vastly different from the actual situation. After detailed adjustment, the fee rates were re-established and approved for implementation. The method of assigning personnel to collect fees was changed to allow merchants to pay on their own within the time limit, thereby eliminating long-standing malpractices.</p>
<p>Rectifying Entertainment Donation Income: In the past, entertainment donations in this city were very small, due to the evasion of taxation by various entertainment venues, or the embezzlement of donations after collection, the malpractices were very serious. After strict measures were formulated to punish those who evaded donations, and personnel were assigned to conduct serious investigations and strict penalties, each entertainment venue was able to comply with the regulations and report and pay donations truthfully. The income has increased sharply, and the past trend of evading donations has also been swept away.</p>
<p>Adjusting the House and Land Donation Rate: In the old one and eight districts of this city, the municipal administration was handled in the past, and the house and land donation was the main source of income, relying on it to make up for deficits. However, in recent years, the donation rate has not been adjusted. The original donation amount is too low, and the deduction rates in the old one and eight districts are uneven, and the burden on the citizens is uneven. Therefore, from the summer, the house donations in each district of this city will be based on the house rent valuation standards set in the 26th year, and the house donations collected will be increased by 250 times the original number. The donation rate is still calculated at 40% of the 26th year. On May 25, the collection was first started in the old one and eight districts. The method for the old urban area has also been formulated according to the standard and implemented one after another. As for the land donation, due to the receipt of the land rent tax of the old urban area, Hùnán, Zháběi, Yángjīng, Fǎhuá, Yǐnxiáng, Pǔsōng, etc. on October 16 last year, and the receipt of the land donation in the eighth districts at the end of March this year, the collection of land donation has been unified. And the original name of the land donation is not entirely suitable, it is renamed land price tax, but the land valuations in each district are individually drafted, resulting in huge price differences, and the collection of land price tax is unfair. After referring to the actual land price situation, and in accordance with the standard of land tax collection in various counties, measures for collecting land price tax were formulated and implemented, so as to balance the burden and enrich the municipal treasury.</p>
<p>The Opening of the Gold Special Tax: The gold trading in this city is extremely prosperous. This transaction is either for speculators to profit from it, or for upstarts to purchase and hoard property. It was approved by the central government to open a special gold tax. The tax rate is 5 per mille, which is borne equally by both buyers and sellers. A Gold Special Tax Collection Committee was organized to be responsible for the collection. All merchants engaged in gold trading must first apply for registration. Those who pass the review are counted as 150 companies, and 50 companies are designated to be responsible for the special tax. Among them, 4 companies have their qualifications for special tax collection revoked and ordered to suspend business due to violation of the law. The remaining 100 companies are affiliated to 46 companies for easy management and prevention of tax evasion. On the one hand, the registered merchants organize their own trade associations. Since the tax was levied on July 5, more than 500,000,000 yuan have been collected by the 30th. It is stipulated that 5% will be first used for all expenses and bonuses, then one-quarter will be paid to the central government, and three-quarters will be transferred to the municipal treasury.</p>
<h3>(B) On the Adjustment of the Organization</h3>
<p>Unification of Accounting Administration: The accounting system of this city was established in July of the 31st year, and a General Accounting Office was established to be in charge of its affairs. The internal organization of the office did not divide the departments according to the nature of the affairs under its jurisdiction, but divided them according to the accounting affairs of the "Old First District", "Old Eighth District", and "Old Urban Area", becoming independent states and failing to implement an integrated organization and adopt an internal control system. As a result, the city's budget and accounting books are divided into three parts: "Old First District", "Old Eighth District", and "Old Urban Area". Revenue and expenditure are independent of each other, and the salaries and benefits of each part are also different. Therefore, on February 1, the General Accounting Office was abolished, and all the affairs handled by the office were merged into the Finance Bureau, and the Accounting Section was established to handle them in a unified manner. Four shares are divided, including the budgeting, accounting, audit (pre-audit and post-audit), and inspection shares.</p>
<p>Merger of Treasuries: In this city, cash receipts and disbursements were nominally provided by the Municipal Treasury, which managed its affairs in a comprehensive manner, but the actual internal organization was handled separately by region. Therefore, the revenue and expenditure system could not be established. For example, the "Centralized Municipal Treasury" was handled by the head office of Fuxing Bank, the "Old Eighth District" Treasury was represented by the South Branch of Fuxing Bank, and the "Municipal Treasury" itself only managed the revenue and expenditure of the Old First District. As a result, receipts and payments were divided and audits were difficult. Therefore, starting from February 1, the business handled by the above treasuries was unified and merged into the newly established Treasury Section of the Finance Bureau. All tax revenues from the city, counties, and suburban areas are directly paid to the Treasury Section with a payment slip, and the expenses requested by various agencies are also directly paid by the Treasury Section based on the payment order. The treasury system is thus determined.</p>
<p>Organizational Adjustment: In order to implement administrative simplification and increase work efficiency, the organization has been adjusted as follows: On February 1, the original four sections of house donation, damage assessment, and urging investigation were merged into the House and Land Donation Section. The duties of the assessment section were incorporated into the House and Land Donation Section, and a share was established to handle them. As for the urging investigation work, it was handled separately by the House and Land Donation Section and other relevant personnel. The various donations and taxes within the Old Eight Isolated Area were originally collected by the Ma Chang Road Office. Starting from January 22, the consumption special tax part was merged into the Consumption Special Tax Section for handling. On April 1, the Ma Dang Road Office was abolished, and all the donations and taxes collected by the office were classified into the respective competent sections for continued handling according to their nature. The Consumption Special Tax Office had a distorted organization and a large scale. Therefore, it was changed to the Consumption Special Tax Section on February 1. The former Tax Section was in charge of the land tax and various donations and taxes in the old urban area and various counties. Since the recovery of the concessions, it has not been corrected. Therefore, on February 1, the land tax, deed process, and sand field cleaning affairs managed by the Tax Section were established as the Land Tax Section to be responsible for handling them. The business tax in the old urban area and various counties managed by the Tax Section was established as the Business Tax Section and classified for handling, and the section was responsible for preparing for the opening of business tax in the old one and eight districts. The other license fees, vehicle and vessel donations, etc., managed by the Tax Section were classified into the respective competent sections for handling, and the collection administration was unified. The Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Inspection Office and the Bamboo and Wood Business Special Tax Inspection Office were both abolished because the number of collections was not high. After the tobacco and alcohol license tax was suspended, the business tax was changed, and after the bamboo and wood business special tax was suspended, the Yaxing was changed to collect the business tax from customers who transport bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal. Although the organization was abolished, the tax revenue was not affected. In order to implement clean politics and prevent the malpractice of financial administrative personnel, a Supervision Section was established on February 1. The Supervision Section personnel can investigate at any time whether the general financial administrative personnel can abide by the law when performing their duties. If there is evidence of embezzlement or other illegal activities, they can be reported and have the power to arrest immediately. Since the establishment of the Supervision Section, the staff on duty have been aware of vigilance and encouragement, and are loyal to their duties. Although the malpractices have not been eliminated, the atmosphere may be clear. The establishment of the Supervision Section is beneficial to the sound organization of financial administration and the development of the spirit of clean politics.</p>
<h3>(C) Revenue and Expenditure Situation and the Burden on Citizens</h3>
<p>After active reorganization of various donations and taxes in this city, the revenue has increased monthly on the surface. Before the special gold tax was levied, the major source of revenue was the special consumption tax. The highest revenue record was in July, totaling 53,700,000 yuan, of which more than 40% had to be remitted to the Ministry of Finance, leaving the city treasury with only over 20,000,000 yuan. Other revenues, although increased, either because the donation and tax rates were not changed (such as entertainment donations, business taxes collected on a per-unit basis, etc.), or because the revenue did not increase as expected even with the changed donation rates (such as housing donations due to vacancy issues and foreign residents' tax arrears, etc.), inevitably affected the overall revenue. On the expenditure side, both salaries and office expenses often needed to be increased, and all kinds of temporary expenses also increased sharply due to high prices. Especially the temporary necessary expenditures to cope with wartime were so urgent that they could not be reduced, and could only be paid with effort. The inability to balance revenue and expenditure is a phenomenon that any financial institution cannot avoid under the wartime system. The revenue and expenditure situation for the past six months is listed separately below.</p>
<p>According to a report from the city's research office, in 1936, the average monthly tax burden for citizens in the old first district of the city was 1.76 yuan. In June 1945, the average monthly tax burden for citizens of the city was 1,235.52 yuan. If 1936 is taken as 100, the citizen tax burden index in June of this year is 70,200, which is 701 times higher than before the war. However, before the incident, there was no business tax within the concession, and the city did not have a special consumption tax. Therefore, the increase in various donation and tax rates after the war is actually far less than 701 times. Even the housing donation, which has increased the most, has only increased to 250 times the original amount in 1937. However, the price index in June of this year has risen to more than 24,000 times that of 1936, which proves that the burden on citizens in this city has not increased compared to before. In fact, the actual burden is less than before the war.</p>
<h3>(D) Opinions on Difficult Problems</h3>
<p>The amount of cultivated land in this city and various counties is 4,523,345 mu. The amount of rice to be collected for the land tax this year is divided into 30% for the first harvest and 70% for the second harvest. The total annual rice to be collected is 416,333 shi. Referring to past tax collection situations, the average actual annual collection only accounts for 60%. However, the difficulty in grain collection is more technical than that of tax collection, coupled with the rising rice prices, farmers are unwilling to pay rice. Further discounting by 10%, a collectable amount of 233,092 shi can be obtained. In addition, due to transportation, losses, and commission expenses, the collected rice is subject to an average loss of 15%, leaving a net yield of only 198,128 shi. However, the monthly rice demand for rations for troops, police, public security, civil servants, teachers, and workers in various districts of the city and suburbs is about 35,000 shi, and the annual demand is 300,000 shi, resulting in a shortage of more than one-third. It is necessary to purchase additional rice to make up for the deficit. Rice prices may rise at any time, and this additional expenditure is impossible to estimate for the time being.</p>
<p>Although the special consumption tax, business tax, and special gold tax may increase in revenue due to rising prices, the account books of commercial firms are incomplete, and there are two sets of account books, one official and one unofficial. Furthermore, because the selling prices exceed the price limits, merchants are afraid of punishment and often do not record them in the account books. As a result, much of the tax to be collected is evaded or embezzled, making investigations difficult. Some merchants even do not understand that paying taxes is an obligation of the people, and instead regard tax evasion as an honor, seeking various ways to get advantages. Furthermore, due to the air raid situation, business is sluggish, and tax revenues may be reduced at any time.</p>
<p>When commercial firms apply for various licenses, according to previous practice, they must submit copies to various bureaus for review. Only after being deemed qualified can the licenses be issued. If the various bureaus fail to process them quickly, honest merchants become suspicious and think that they must offer bribes, while cunning people operate without licenses, which damages the government's reputation. Therefore, close contact between the various bureaus and joint adoption of rapid and effective methods are necessary.</p>
<p>In the past, the old urban area and the first and eighth districts each had different accounting systems. This year, the preparation of a unified general budget is difficult because there is no standard to follow and data collection is difficult. A good budget lies in careful preparation beforehand, so that revenue and expenditure can be balanced afterwards. However, at present, prices are rising daily, and it is difficult to increase revenue arbitrarily, while expenditure is difficult to reduce due to the variety of expenses. The gap between revenue and expenditure is becoming increasingly large and cannot be balanced. In addition, as the situation has entered a serious stage, prices will continue to rise, and the expenditures of various institutions must in fact expand. To meet the needs of wartime, various projects such as road construction, air defense facilities, etc., cannot be reduced. Expenses such as relief, medical care, and pensions for air raid victims cannot but be planned for in advance. The amount of expenditure hereafter will inevitably be huge and impossible to reduce. In the second half of the year, the salaries of civil servants in this city will be greatly increased according to the regulations of the central government. Because the price level in this city is the highest in all regions, a local living allowance will be added in addition to the wartime allowance. Although the amount of this expenditure is very large, the income of each civil servant, judging from the current cost of living index, can only maintain the minimum living standard of one or two people. If prices rise again in the future, the increased salaries will not be enough. If civil servants are to be honest and law-abiding, they must be given the minimum cost of living. However, for those responsible for finance, fulfilling this most basic and minimal requirement is also very difficult. Under this wartime state, financial resources are limited, and not only is it impossible to reduce expenditures, but it is also necessary to raise the necessary funds at any time for emergency payments. In the past year, the difficult situation encountered has been deeply felt to be like living through a year in a day, and it is not easy to cope with. The difficulties that will be encountered in the future will surely exceed those of the first half of the year by far. Fortunately, the actual burden on citizens is lighter than before the war. In the future, wise citizens will surely understand the actual financial difficulties of the city and provide full cooperation, which is the great fortune of those who are in charge.</p>
