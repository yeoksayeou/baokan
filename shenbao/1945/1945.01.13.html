<p>東京十二日中央社電　日大本營十二日下午三時三十分發表：（一）於仁牙因灣沿岸登陸之敵兵力，步兵二師，戰車一師左右，於聖法比安正面稍有進出外，於海岸附近整備態勢，更企圖增强兵力。日軍陸地部隊對此邀擊敢鬥中。（二）日軍航空部隊亦繼續猛攻仁牙因灣附近敵艦船，一月九·十兩日收獲之戰果，經確認者如次：轟沉運輸船一艘，巡洋艦二艘，擊沉運輸船二艘，航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦二艘。重傷起火者運輸船七艘，航空母艦一艘，航空母艦或戰艦二艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十二日中央社電　敵美於猛烈砲轟及飛機轟炸掩護下，終於九日上午於仁牙因灣之聖法比安及仁牙因之間登陸，更於十日上午以有力之後續部隊登陸，企圖擴大橋頭堡，自下正與日軍守備部隊展開激戰。自十日下午一時許，敵軍更以多數之登陸用舟艇，滿載約二千名兵士，企圖於拉朋（聖法比安北方約十公里）開始新登陸，斯時，待機中之日軍陸上部隊，一致向敵軍舟艇羣開始猛烈射擊，結果擊沉裝載戰車之大型舟艇七八艘及多數之舟艇，而澈底粉碎敵之登陸企圖。敵蒙受重大打擊後，則狼狽潰退，故日軍滅敵之士氣愈高，從事突擊作戰之精神，已令敵軍震驚矣。目下敵軍特以登陸軍集中於聖法比安，專事掩護後續部隊登陸，並圖强化橋頭堡，且準備以優勢之戰車部隊爲中心，以期發動大攻勢，故日。美兩軍於仁牙因灣之大決戰即將展開矣。</p>
<p>聖法比安附近　展開激烈混戰</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十二日中央社電　敵美登陸部隊，於仁牙因灣登陸後，十日以該灣之聖法比安爲中心，已有擴大向橋頭堡之企圖。同時，該灣內之敵艦艇亦以砲艦繼續猛烈射擊，並動員該方面之航空總兵力，向日軍陣地攻擎。日軍方面亦採取進擊攻勢，以精銳部隊猛烈反擊，即敵軍首先於十日下午四時，以多數戰車爲先導之數部隊，於砲兵支援下，開始自聖法此安向東方攻擊。又六時四十分，敵軍一部已突入日軍陣地之一角，對此，日軍當即將後方兵力使之前進，待與敵展開激烈之混戰後，已將敵軍逐出陣地之外。旋敵於愈加猛烈之集中砲火射擊之後，又一度以戰車爲先導，向日軍陣地突入，日軍對此加以反覆攻擊，現敵已盤着日軍突角陣地之一部，於其附近一帶，刻正激戰中。一方日軍之突擊隊，自敵登陸以來，即畫夜襲敵，逐次炸碎敵軍之砲火，又敵狹以飛機數量之大，不時反覆以戰鬥及轟炸機，對日軍陣地或在彈藥倉康加以投射，而灣內之敵艦船亦發射照明彈，同時並繼續其砲艦射擊，故刻下仁牙因灣已化爲凄壯無此之決戰塲。</p>
<p>日陸海特攻隊先後重創敵艦</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地十二日中央社電　日陸軍特別攻擊隊富嶽隊，十日拂曉攻擊仁牙因灣西岸玻里諾西北方海面行動中之敵機動部隊，據日方掩護機報告，已命中敵空母或似戰艦之大型艦二艘，使之大爆炸。日特別攻擎隊另一隊，更於同日下午突入仁牙因灣內敵船團，猛撞敵運輸船三艘，使之重創起火。是日傍晚，日特攻隊另一隊攻擊該灣內游（弋中之敵機動部隊，命中其空母一艘，據日掩護機所證實，敵艦大爆炸後即行沉沒。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍基地十二日中央社電日神風特攻隊一隊，九日突入仁牙因灣，重創敵戰艦一艘，巡洋艦及大型驅逐艦二艘。</p>
<p>日軍組突擊隊衝入敵砲陣地</p>
<p>菲律靈前綫基地十二日中央社電　日軍新銳部隊，畫夜對侵入仁牙因灣之敵軍肉搏，予敵以重大損失，十日下午二時半，某部隊下士等三人組成之突擊隊，潛入砲火瀰漫之敵隊聖法比安東北之迫擊砲陣地，將其幕舍二處炸燬，全員安然歸還。又某隊白島班長以下三名突擊隊，於十日晨十時半潛入構築陣地之聖法比安東方敵野砲陣地，將野砲二門，重機槍若干炸毀。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地十二日中央社電　侵入呂朱島仁牙因灣之敵第一次及第二次船團，於日軍之猛攻下，卒於九日晨實行登陸，其後敵於十日未明，復以運輸船百餘艘，登陸用舟艇約數十艘，於空母十艘嚴護之下到達該灣，是時，日駐菲機隊即全體出動，而對登陸之驕敵，作悲壯之攻擊，結果敵第一次船團遭日機痛擊後，於六日到仁牙因灣時，僅餘大型船兩艘，舟艇的六十艘，敵於受創後，乃放棄登陸之企圖。又由運輸船五十餘艘，舟艇二百數十艘編成之敵第二次船團，迄入日晚侵入該灣之際，其損失已達四成矣。按敵方最近之戰法，係採取小船多數主義，蓋欲藉此以迴避日軍特攻隊猛攻，然日機專以其中最大者爲目標，目前之戰鬥演變成陸戰，呂宋戰綫方面日軍，刻正於仁牙因灣之一部與敵軍邀擊中，日軍予全呂宋島中之陸上陣地極其强靱，故於敵軍登陸後之呂宋決戰第二階段中，實難免遭受日軍強力之反擊也。</p>
<p>阿古諾河流域將有大攻防戰</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　日特攻隊仍繼續猛炸仁牙因灣敵船團。據美聯社從軍記者十二日訊稱，日本飛機及魚雷艇，曾夜襲運輸美第十四兵團援軍之護送船團，結果命中數敵船，然敵軍自恃物量充足，仍以運輪船陸續進入仁牙因灣，企圖擴大橋頭堡。據敵方消息美軍及澳軍約十萬兵力，並攜帶萬噸以上之裝備及軍用品，業已登陸云。馬加薩謀將主力沿馬尼刺道南下於呂宋中央平原，以期與日軍主力決戰。又據敵方消息稱：推測日。美軍曾陸續自南方向阿古諾河方面亦到達阿古諾河綫也。據美聯社前綫訊稱，美軍方量一部業到達仁牙因西力十公里之阿古諾河口，刻正遭受日軍猛烈之砲擊，故戰局更趨緊迫。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據美太平洋第七艦隊消息，美水陸作戰軍司令海軍少將巴貝十一日發表：菲律賓作戰開始後，美軍卸陸之補給物資及裝備品，已越八萬噸。</p>
<h3 id="c2">摩羅泰兩月間　被炸六十次　日航空部隊綜合戰果 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>西南太平洋日軍基地十二日中央社電　日航空部隊，對敵侵入菲律賓空軍基地之摩羅泰島之敵飛機塲，隨時加以攻擊，粉碎其企圖。日陸軍機隊由十一月四日至一月寸日之間，先後猛襲六十次，已獲赫赫戰果，敵機塲被炸起火一百四十處，爆炸者四十四處以上，並炸毀陸上物資集積所多處。敵機損失計起火者一百五十三架，內大型機九十九架，中型機二十八架，小型機二十六架，敵機受有輕重傷者一百二十八架，擊落敵機二架。</p>
<h3 id="c3">抱必勝信念將敵美擊滅　松島部長闡述菲島戰局 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部，於昨日下午二時循例舉行報道常會，出席松島部長，鹽田大尉，及囑託林俊夫王炳南等，席間由松島部長講述最近太平洋戰局情形。談話如次：</p>
<p>登陸敵軍陷於混亂</p>
<p>關於太平洋最近戰局情形，自去年十二月下旬，在菲律賓一帶活動之因灣，日方航空部隊及水上部隊協力對來襲之敵軍加以猛攻。敵恃多量之運輸船，於本月八日到達仁牙因灣，九日起開始登陸，敵從仁牙因南方起至聖法比安地方之兵力，約有兩個師，經日陸上部隊及航空部隊予以猛攻，敵已陷於混亂狀態。敵力援助登部隊，將其軍隊分爲數團，在呂宋島東方海面游弋。此種機動部隊，無論以特種航空母艦（即以商船改造之航空母艦）作主要輸送，維護機動部隊之戰，一巡洋艦，驅逐艦等值艦部份，爲數無多，故戰力亦殊低劣。</p>
<p>距日愈近對日有利</p>
<p>麥克沃塞司令部對此次作戰擴大宣傳，據謂已佔領據點三十餘處，現正對馬尼拉積極前云進云，此種宣傳，均屬錯誤。據路透社十日紐約電稱，在呂朱島上陸之美軍，已目登陸地點前進十八哩乃至二十哩，在美軍二百五十萬噸的船團中間的路途中，竟發現日方之特別水泳隊勇猛亂戰。現在戰塲從表面上看來，自雷伊泰島經明多羅島而移至呂宋島來，似乎日方漸漸被壓迫，但從戰略上說，愈距日本接近，土地愈寬廣，對於日本愈爲有利，也就是日本在各戰塲，使敵能多出血，多消耗，於可能範圍內，在接近地點，予以殲滅。</p>
<p>敵美人力大感困難</p>
<p>關於敵方出血作戰，損傷重大情形，據十一日華盛頓路透社稱，美國陸軍次長柏特遜曾謂，在今年六個月以內，須增加九十萬兵力，方可廳戰，可知敵方損害之嚴重。麥克沃塞在準備進攻菲律賓作戰之初，僅有二十萬兵力，而在仁牙因灣登陸者，不過四五萬左右，其中尚包括由雷伊泰島調來一部份，雷伊泰島敵方所受損害極大。際此雷伊泰島雙方對峙態勢之時，敵方尚須關遺一部兵力至他處，其人力的困難，顯然可見。關於今後太平洋戰局，在菲律賓作戰，謂爲太平洋戰局最後決定作戰，本人亦頗相信，但在可能範圍內，使敵遭受更多出血，更大消耗，照我們預定戰略推進。敵方愈接近日本木士，我方希望愈大，前已屢次言之，尤其使敵人不能到中國大陸上來，比種方針，始終不變。</p>
<p>奮鬥到底抱有決心</p>
<p>在目前戰局情形，頗易引起上海地方民心動搖，此點應特別加以注意。其次敵方亟思對上海及和平區內重要都市，進行空襲，根據長沙衡陽等處已經實騐過的空襲結果，美國係無差別的盲目亂炸，而最受損害者乃爲中國人之生命財產，不勝遺憾。一月八日晚本人曾對渝方及和平區廣播，欲促使東方民族認識此次戰爭及奮鬥之意義，吾人始終有對此次戰爭審鬥到底之決心，故對敵方轟炸絲毫不足畏。無諭如何，能使中國人之生命財產的損害，愈少愈好，此乃吾人所極爲顧慮之事事。因之對於防空凖備，極關緊要，應勸告中國民衆，加緊此種防預工作。</p>
<p>地點進展無關重要</p>
<p>本人屬爲敵方作戰方法，均係「不完全前進作戰」，如現在戰局，敵在馬紹爾，加羅林，帛勞島等處跳島作戰，企圖趕快到中國大陸來的局勢。總之，敵方企圖，不顧途中基礎如何，欲早到中國大陸，擾亂中國民隊，使日本在大陸建設，陷於混亂，根據此點，預料將來作戰，敵方或不顧菲律賓作戰情形如何，而向中國大陸蠢動，此不能不加以考慮者。如此可使敵人東西奔命，處處消耗，最後將其擊滅，最爲妙策。一般不了解作戰者，或易滋誤會，然最後目的，將敵擊滅，地點進展殊無關重要。總之，此次作戰，吾人有必勝信念，使敵消耗，最後將其消滅，吾人始終有此把握。</p>

<h3 id="c4">渝共的關係 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>渝共的關係，由團結而抗戰，在抗戰中又開始分裂，幾年來，彼此打起抗戰之旗，各行其是，造成內鬨局面，你反我制，各不相下，愈演愈烈，分裂形勢，時時有一觸即發之勢，關心中國前途的人士，都很繫念這個問題。我們願以局外人的觀察，對此問題，作一分析。</p>
<p>渝共關係的核心，是蔣介石反對中共在抗戰中擴張勢力，而中共須在抗戰中發展，因此，反共問題，又成爲渝國民黨的中心任務之一。</p>
<p>溯反共問題，在中國政治舞台上開了很久，著名的十年剿共，諒大家還能記得吧。江西的五次圍剿，纔把他們打出老巢，七零入落的逃回陝北。到了西安事變，蔣介石爲了報謝中共不殺之恩，把十年怨讐，一笑了之，握手言好，接受中共的抗日主張，而中共則以放棄階級鬥爭相投報，擁護抗戰建國綱領，結成「民族抗日統一戰綫」，共同「抗日」。血淋淋的反共問題，從此一筆勾銷，全國團結一致的氣象，極盛一時。</p>
<p>但是，盛筵難再，好景不常，武漢失陷，遜都重慶之後，決定長期拖戰，覺得盲戰二年中，自己的勢力，損失不少，而中共却乘機發展，回想過去十年剿共的艱難，深自恐懼，大有悔不該的意思。然而，又不能自己親手卸下抗戰招牌，再來一次先安內，後攘外，只好製定制止異黨活動辦法，暗中動員部下，開始下層磨擦，傳造成公開討伐的局面，用心很苦。民國二十九年冬的皖南事件，是希望引導渝共重新去走十六年的老路，可是，蔣介石的「兩抗」政策—一面抗戰，一面抗共—縛住了自己手足，陷於極端矛盾中，不能有發展。延安周圍，蔣介石雖以七十萬大軍對鎖了六年多，沒有一個很好的機會直搗延安，拔了中共的根。前年秋天，蘇聯聲明取消第三國際組織，這是千載難逢的機會，胡宗南頗欲率精銳一舉而殲之，形勢非常嚴重，中共趕快舉起「團結抗戰」的老拳來招架，纔把蔣介石擊回抗戰的矛盾中，掩旗息鼓，渡過危機。</p>
<p>然而，蔣介石並不就此氣餒，想以「抗戰勝利」的拳頭，還擊中共，所以在去年雙十節的演詞中，强調抗戰的勝利，必須有統一的軍令，在全國人的面前斥責中共的「擁軍割據」是破壞軍令的統一，破壞軍令的統一是「奸軍偽然」，這種駡法，可以說駡得很痛快，但能吾激起全面的反共，恐怕蔣介石沒有考慮。等到蔣介石學會拿「抗戰旗子」當炸彈，打擊中共的時候，中共又發明了新武器來反攻，就是利用渝蔣軍事上的失利，和美國的壓力，要挾重慶，根本解除渝蔣政治上反共的武器，所以公然提出各黨各派參加的「聯合政府」。「聯合統帥部」的要求，一步緊逼一步，甚有分庭抗禮之概。</p>
<p>渝蔣爲了對抗起見，更動一部份美國輿論所不滿的人事，以敷衍美國，和綏外交上的壓力；在內政上，避免給予中共藉以攻訐和蠱惑民衆的口實，爭取民衆的信仰，在今年元旦日的廣播中聲稱：「祗要軍事情勢安定，反攻基礎確立，即富頌布憲法，還政於民。」延安方面對於蔣氏的預的，猛烈的給以空頭支票的非難，在國人面前澈底曇露其欺騙性，同時，列舉事實加以反駁，提出實際問題相責難。今天的渝共關係，是針鋒相對的爭，爭的什麼？爭的是民衆；以牙還牙的鬥，鬥的是什麼？鬥的是「聯合政府」「聯合統帥部」。觀乎渝共談判會議席上，延安代表林祖滿的「共黨有若干萬正規軍，若干萬民軍」的發言，其中目的固然出於要求平分外援，但言外之音，何嘗無向渝蔣示威，有不達到目的不止的意思。</p>

<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問：今天有很多問題要問你。你以前說過，何應欽和孔祥熙是蔣介石政權的中流砥柱，他們的沒落，就是證明蔣介石本身的沒落，可是朱子文就任行政院長以來，自然大家都明白，重慶政攘就逐漸成爲英美派的天下。那末請先就朱子文登台的經過，說明一下。</p>
<p>答：重慶的行政院長本來是蔣介石，蔣介石前此始終忙於軍務，而事實上的事務，全由副院長孔祥熙獨掌。至於今年，正如蔣介石所說，中國是軍事第一的決戰年。所以自從去年底，就絞腦榨汁地研究這一問題，最後便決定行政院長讓專任人才担任，目已則專心担任軍事。固然重慶人才還有，然而能扭任行政院長者，却是寥寥無幾。誰都曉得，現在的重慶政權雖說是黨國，然而並非操於國民黨之手，而是操於蔣一家以及蔣嫡系數家之手。質言之，並不是中國政府，而是蔣家政府。所以能就行政院長那樣重要職位的人物，就受到了極大的限制。先就目前重慶政權裏面得以候補行政院長的人物，放寬尺碼來物色，至多也不過是孔祥熙，宋子文，張羣，陳果夫，陳立夫，何應欽數人而已。此輩人物中，在具有蔣家行政院長能力與資格的這一點來看，宋子文是最適當的人物。老實說，宋子文因過於具有這種能力與資格，所以他一直到今因從未當過行政院長。固然蔣介石是以量大而容納反對者著稱的，但他總脫不了「獨裁者」所犯的共同毛病。普通獨裁者都是懦夫，雖然說是懦夫，但並不是怕「死」的意思，爲保護自已個人的櫂力，而總是疑神疑鬼，怕有人爭奪「他的」的權力。蔣介石雖然是獨裁者，但與史太林希特勒那種獨裁還不同，他的獨裁基礎是建立於各派勢力的均衡上（請看拙著再論重慶政權），所以他的疑神疑鬼程度最大。蔣介石決不允許在周圍有和他的權力相比擬的人物存在。雖說按能力和資格，宋子文全不是蔣介石的對手，然而英美壓力在全世界內普遍加强時，自然朱子文的周圍也逐漸集合了一批人物，如王正廷。顧維鈞。王寵惠。郭泰祺。陳光甫等，全是蔣介石嫡系外的人物，都在擁護朱子文。蔣介石自不得不注意這一點。這就是使蔣介石未曾重用宋子文的一個理由。然而時至今日，蔣介石已經處在不能「我行我素」「朕即國家」的形勢上了。</p>
<p>問：蔣介石不得不讓朱子文繼任行政院長的形勢，究竟是什麼？</p>
<p>答：第一就是對美問題。重慶敷衍美國的民主要求，局部實行政府改組，以陳誠代何應欽而長軍政部，以俞鴻鈞代孔祥熙而長財政部，但道種改組，自然正如莫斯科的政府機關報「消息報」（十二月二日）所指摘，完全是「裝腔作勢」的改組。美國非常不滿意這種換湯不換藥的改組，於是爲了應付重慶的這種敷衍了事態度，美國便與中國共產黨直接交換軍事代表團。這就是蔣介石最怕的一點。蔣介石所最怕的對手，並不是日本，而是中國共產黨。他認爲日本雖强，可以讓美國去對付，至於中國共產黨，則非自己下手不可。但事與願違，偏偏美國承認了中國共產黨政治力的存在，不僅與之互派軍事視察團，而且美國駐渝大使哈萊還親目訪問延安政府，企圖調整國共問題。蔣介石並不傻，知道對於美國重視延安的態度採取前此那樣强硬政策，是有百害而無一利的，所以便把美國人所贊同的宋子文拖出來。</p>
<p>第二就是戰局關係。重慶政府於十二月十八日的掃蕩報社諭上曾說：「重慶很希望美國在完全收復菲律賓的戰爭未結束之前，即在中國大陸上岸。美軍早日在中國沿岸登陸，這是適合於協約國全體的一致要求」。蔣介石對於目前的戰局，也實在自已不能勝任了。本來蔣介石是不希望美國軍隊登陸的。美國軍隊在中國登陸而與日本軍隊死拼，這固然是一件求之不得的事，然而將來却是可怕的。伊索寓言中「馬之復仇」故事曾說，馬爲了報復鹿而求人，人則騎在這匹馬上追趕鹿，終於殺死了鹿，然而後來人知道了馬是最有用的動物，所以便利用馬代步了。這是作者對於「馬鹿」（日文乃愚蠢意）開始的西洋雙關戲語。所以蔣介石如履薄冰如臨深淵地警戒着，重慶不要效法馬靠人殺鹿的故事。然而情形業已到了如今這樣緊急地步，已經不容許顧及將來了。目前日本的南征軍與安南出發的北伐軍，十二月十日已經在廣西省緩淥完全會師了。因此，第三，第四，第七等戰區，完全被切斷與重慶的通絡了。道三個戰區的軍事常局很明瞭，重慶旣無實力又無意志來突破日軍戰綫而打通補充綫。他們唯一的希望，就是美國軍隊在南方海岸登陸，從海洋上建立起補充綫。否貝，這三個戰區將不能支持。他們固然知道日本軍隊不會向第三戰區和第四戰局發動大規模作戰，但重慶軍隊一被切斷兵站綫時，往往兵士變成土匪，而在民衆間爲非作歹。固然重慶從來並不怕自已的兵士在民衆間爲非作歹，但重慶所最怕者，是中國共產黨乘此機會，向民衆表示好感，反襯重慶軍隊的惡劣，以收攬該兩戰區的民心，建立鞏固政權。試看蘇北及山東的往例，重慶軍隊被切斷兵站綫後，則不能生存而自消自滅，但在這樣戰區裏，中國共產黨的勢力却迅速發展起來。這種趨勢，目前在浙江省各處都顯著地表現出來。重慶爲防止這種趨勢，便不得不歡迎美國軍隊登陸。美國軍隊登陸，縱令有害於中國的獨立自主，但並非目前的害。對於身號虛弱的鴉片癮者，如停止供給鴉片則會一命嗚呼。所以對於這樣病入膏肓的鴉片　者，明知鴉片有毒，而也只好供給。重慶爲拯救目前這種危機，明知美軍登陸有害，而也只好希望這樣作。重慶旣發生這樣弱點，美國則想盡量利用這一弱點，至於登陸作戰，則始終不與重慶以確定的日期，故意使重慶着急，藉此美國想强迫重慶作一政治讓步。重慶現在眞如熟鍋上之螞蟻，而落在美國的圈套中了。這就是重慶再行改組的第二個理由。</p>
<p>第三就是國共合作的要求。日本軍隊業已入貴州省境，已成刺入重慶心臟之勢。具有敏銳感覺的駐渝UP特派員，甚至預言重慶命運將決定於兩月內。蔣介石也愈益感覺棘手，因而南調前此始終包圍中共的主力軍胡宗南機械化部隊三十萬增援，担任重慶國防。於是渝方對中共的實際壓力，無形大减。以致中共的態度，也似乎更加理直氣壯起來。時至今日，蔣介石也只有靠政治妥協來壓迫中共。於是蔣介石對於中共的態度，巳經不是一向那樣公然强辭奪理，而毫無誠意的國共合作交涉了，現在蔣介石則不得不佯作眞心實意的面孔了。裝腔作勢，就得把中共所相信的人物放在重慶政權的顯要地位上。現在重慶方面最受中共信任的政治家，只有朱子文和孫科。此二人，中共稱爲重慶的自由主義二實。然而孫科飛黃騰達的時機尚未到來，何况國共合作交涉的現階段，是表現着中共—美國—重慶的三角關係，所以與上述三者都具有相當關係的朱子文，才是眞正最適合的人物。這就是宋子文彼任爲行政院長的第三個理由。</p>
<p>問：朱子文掌握大權後，最近的將來，國共合作是否有好轉希望？</p>
<p>答：在討論這一間題前，需要先來檢討一下朱子文的爲人。暫且不諭朱子文是否爲能幹的財政家的問題。只要說明他對於中國革命的立塲就够了。我認爲他和一般有錢的知識份子一樣，是一個社會革命的「懦夫」。這決不是我的私見，只要言一下他對於武漢革命的態度，就可瞭如指掌。當時慫恿宋子文參加武漢政府的美國新聞記者文孫特·舍恩（Vincent　Sheean），曾在扎記中寫過:</p>
<p>「宋子文很聰明，能够理解國民黨的眞正繼承人，是武漢政府，並不是蔣介石的軍閥獨裁（至少他這樣說過）。他雖曾受過威脅利誘，但總是拒絕參加蔣介石的政府。他的住宅經常在密探的監視下，以致他成爲非常神經質的人。他從未出過法租界及公共租界一步。因爲蔣介石的爪牙在中國管轄區內到處都是，隨時都有被捕的可能。假如蔣介石捉到他，則他不作財政部長，就得進監獄，非此即彼，二者必居其一。我不相信會殺他，但他却担心這一點。他眞是一位天字第一號的懦夫。而我從漢口帶來的提案，是救他出此難境的途徑。他立刻就同意了，並且託我替一位廣東人姓在的買一張和我同船的票。曾頻頻詢問漢口的情形。</p>
<p>第二天他變了心。他和母親姊妹以及妹夫討論中便變了心。他的家庭是極其反動的。他精神不安地成爲神經質說：『我沒有到漢口去的理由。你知道我並非是社會革命家，我是憎惡革命的，我不相信革命。工農政策逼迫商人及工業家停止營業時，呌我怎樣能够使預算前後相符，呌我怎樣能够發行通貨？我是不能說服中央執行委員的……』道種心情的變化，曾在他的頭腦裏支配了一星期。我認爲這是他典型的自由主義動搖之最大表現」（Pcrsonal　History　：By　VincentSheean　P.254-255）。</p>
<p>與文孫特，舍恩同一時代接近宋子文的安那。盧伊斯。斯特隆（Anna　Louise　Strong），對於宋子文也曾下過同樣的評語：</p>
<p>「宋子文生來就是一位保守的實業家，曾讀書於美國哈佛大學。他天生就喜歡實業家，而厭惡共產主義者和工人的。他的明顯前途，就是當上海的實業家。假如他見過國民黨的顧問俄國人鮑羅廷（Borodin），而未受其影響，則他一定會富上海的實業家。革命曾賦與朱子文以權力，以建設國家財政的機會。破壞他的成就和剝奪他的財產，是軍閥。因此，朱子文厭惡共產主義者，同時也厭惡軍閥。至於建設國家銀行，共產主義者的態度尚好，最壞而不講理者就是軍閥。武漢政府固然不能滿足他的慾望，然而却賜與他創造國家財政的機會。並且武漢政府高高舉着反對軍閥的人民政府之大轟。所以他希望到武漢去而能看見武漢的成功。並且他曉得他的任務在號召他。但他並沒有去武漢。因爲他與蔣介石以及上海的商人具有過深的個人關係。</p>
<p>他會對我說：「盡可能早日到揚子江上流去吧！在南京並沒有可以聽的事情，並沒有可以看的事情。滿處都是花花綠綠的標語，和中國的舊有的腐敗。武漢則與南京相反，充滿着有意義的社會實騐』，他曾三番四次地向孫文夫人宋慶齡以及老友鮑羅廷捎信說，一等到能逃出蔣介石的耳目時，立刻就到武漢去聚首。……他似乎是想眞這樣作。他有他個人的苦衷。然而他最後一次碰到我的時候，曾無意識地說過：「再見吧！我們到北京相會吧！暫時別離了』。根據這句話，我知道他應富採取的道路，當他未瞭解在生命方面，在名聲方面，全都是最安全的以前，他是準備等待的。」</p>
<p>解釋他這樣性格的資料，是不勝枚舉的。我只是從無數資料中，選出一兩份特別和他要好的美國人的觀察，加以叙述而已。常然，一個人往往因修養而前進，目前的宋子文或許比十五年前的朱子文更加成熟和世故了。他的社會地位後來雖日益萬固，但我從未聽到他的思想發生了甚麼革命轉變。誠然，他目從抗戰以來對於中共相當理解，這是事實。但我認爲這是對抗蔣介石不喜歡他的原故，而作出來的虛張聲勢。假如朱子文眞有這樣性格，豈不是就可以藉他的魄力和人格，能使國共關係空前好轉。</p>
<p>問：然則宋子文就行政院長職，就沒有任何政治意義麼？</p>
<p>答：正相反，是具有極大政治意義的。是反映目前世界形勢最顯著的事件。正如你所知道的，反軸心方面以爲目前的問題是不是蘇聯的天下，即是美國的天下。非此即彼這一問題，遠在第一次世界大戰結束後，就曾被一般人所討諭。一九二八年埃德加，摩勒（Edgar　Mowrer）曾在「這個美國世界」（This　American　World）一書的第二面上寫過：</p>
<p>「歐洲在以往，曾是決定地球大部份人類命運的。然而目前，歐洲逐漸失掉了這種決定性。現代的歐洲人，與其過去揚眉吐氣，雄視闊步的時代，不可同日而語了。歐洲偉大的思想，固然仍在放射光芒，然而却是在遙遠的密集雲霧中。大多數人類都公開地承認，在潛意識中所期待的「新文化，新宗敎，新精神」，或許不是在蘇聯那是在美國這兩個絕對相反的精神不同領域內看得到。然而蘇聯的羽毛未全，尚待發展。而另一個的美國，却早已鶴立鷄羣了。唯其如此，蘇聯的領導者才在美國物色物質發展的樣本」。</p>
<p>摩勒寫這木書的時候，是一九二八年。現在已經渡過了十六個寒暑。在這個期間，蘇聯已經長大成人，而美國所說的「巴俾特（Bobbit）」文明，業已達到爛熟期了。最近世界形勢中特別明顯者，就是這兩種勢力的鬥爭與妥協等現象。這兩種勢力是否能够妥協？抑或最近將發生正面衡突？這種問題是影響目前世界大戰最大的力量。固然誰都想早日結束這個第二次世界大戰，然而事實則仍遙遙無期。至於第二次世界大戰接着就轉變爲第三次世界大戰，抑或是經過一個或長或短的安定時期將再爆發，這就是問題癥結。陳友仁先生在世時，我曾常拿這一間題來與他討論。他根據英美蘇三强間數度會議的動向看，認爲兩種勢力有可能達到某種協定，所以他以爲會有相當的安定期問。至於我則認爲目前的蘇聯，的確對於劃分世界勢力範圍上努力在爭取某種程度上的協定。此種協定或許可能成立。但此種協定，用比擬來說，是等於以河洗與陸地爲界綫的協定。河洗因上潮與下潮，而界綫在不斷地變化着，因此目前縱稱作陸地，但上潮時，稱爲界綫的陸地本身，就變爲河洗。具體言之，蘇聯與英義協定後，蘇聯則向全世界聲明不宣傳共產主義。或許將成立這樣的協定。但二者所協定的界綫圈內，只要有人民存在，和階級鬥爭存在，則其本身的運動就會決定走向蘇聯的世界，抑或走向英美的世界（或不走向任何一個）。蘇聯和英美無論作何種協定，但各該國民本身的遝動決定其政體後，就不發生任何效力了。所以蘇聯和英美無論怎樣達到瓜分世界的協定，往往被各該國的人民運動所推翻。以致破壞英美與蘇聯間的均衡關係，而愈益激化其對立。試觀目前轟動全世界的希腦內亂，以及兩個波蘭政府的對立，就是最好的例證。除了此等主洗的對立外，尚有此等暗洗的對立，例如法國特戈爾政府與共產主義武裝隊的對立，以及意大利和南斯拉夫等國內部的對立。史太林對各該國人民運動的發展具有充分信心，所以很高興與英美締結協定。然而史太林的內心，早已洞知此種協定不能常此繼續下去。自然，羅斯福和邱吉爾也不是不曉得。只要日德兩國强大地存在一天，則羅邱二人雖明知爲暫時，亦必須與蘇聯締結協定，而向國民撒佈一切幻想，認爲第二次世界大戰後的世界，將取得安定。這就是英美的弱點。</p>
<p>問：慢說！羅斯福不是曾宣言過，戰後世界各國的政體，將由各該國人民來決定麼？</p>

<p>環顧海上各校，能斟酌實際情形，體諒學生父兄負擔，而竭力抑低學費者，岡不在少數。然而有的學校，正嚴令學生先繳留額金，並限年內繳淸學雜費；否則不發成績報告單，不許領取入學證，甚至不得開學上課，以此爲恫嚇，遂令學生向家長哭訴要求，而家長迫於生活，無法應付，於是紛紛向申新兩報墾助貸學金。本館門首，速日擁滿此輩可愛的貧苦學生，其餘來函要求的，亦如雪片飛來，案牘盈尺。木報同人對此實情，除深表同情與撫慰之外，只覺心餘力薄，愛莫能助。且看本屆助金預算，即使能募足三千萬元，資助上屆四千五百餘舊生，每人以平均一萬元計，共需四千五百餘萬元，數目尚差不少；何况至今只募得不足二千萬元，（至今日止共存一千八百八十萬餘元）看來資助新生，尚無把握，所以新生面請或函請救濟，我們簡直沒有辦法！你們來懇求，只是增加我們的焦急與罪戾。要說何時可以開放「新生的申請」？惟有請社會有鐵有力的熱心人來答復，我們是有心無力，不敢稍存敷衍與唐塞的心理。</p>

<h3 id="c38">宋子文入閣與　重慶的煩悶 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>（自第二版轉來）</p>
<p>答：是的。然而美國是否眞能這樣作呢？我敢武斷地說，戰後美國，絕對不容許有採取目前這樣自由主義外交政策的餘地。其理由很簡單：美國正如它本身所大吹大擂者，是全世界反軸心國的兵工廠。美國的軍需工業，在供給着全世界反軸心國家日常所消耗的大量武器。尤其最近軍需工業的發展，不可諱言地曾有了相當成績。例如飛機生產，姑以一九四一年的生產指數爲一〇〇，據美方宣傳一九四二年爲三四四，一九四三多，至於一九四四年，則總會超過十倍以上。這樣美國的軍需工業，在空前大規模地採購不爲功，進而至於消耗，則亦不以空前大規模地消耗不爲功。換言之，文無論從那一個視角看，美國的金融資本主義，業巳發展到非宰割全世界不可了。根據這一點，美國的外交政策裏？明顯地透露出兩個特徵來。第一，美國在西半球上巳經不能維持一向過去所實行的自由主義外交了。這就是赫爾壓迫南美外交的原因，就是阿根廷和美國間發生不睦的理由。第二，美國的外交政策，最近已經不是單純指西半球而言了，現在巳達到單靠過去西半球　市塲亦不能生存的地步了。世界市塲，葉巳成爲美國資本主義生產所不可或缺的必要條件了。羅斯福很知道這一點，所以乘着战争期間，向世界各處派遣經濟顧問，以取得維持世界市塲所必要的點赫綫。</p>
<p>因此，美國所預定的戰後各個市塲，假如脫離美國的統制，或者完全建立起來擱該民族獨立的經濟政策，則美國的戰時投資，不僅空費心血，而且對於美國資本主義本身的生存將有危機。對於各國選擇政體的自由，是不能允許的。</p>
<p>問：問題說的太遠了，美國的現狀與宋子文的出山，究竟有什麽關係？</p>
<p>答：羅斯福想握緊，作爲美國戰後金融資本的投資市塲。關於這一點，一月五日里斯本電訊中曾有一段說：「美國商會所代表的美國工商業巨頭，過去一年曾爲美國與中國間的互惠貿易條約，而暗中奔走。但這是預算戰後的中國，將體騐工業發展的偉大新時代。該商會會長開利（Kelley）聲明，重慶發言人業巳保證，重慶對於外國貿易和投資的各種法規，曾在自由主義的方針下加以修正，且通商自由企業，按近代化的獨立司法機關加以保護。」</p>
<p>宋子文的出山，就是開利所講的重慶新路綫下之結果。最近蔣介石曾聲明在戰爭期間亦將施行黨政，這也是同一路綫下之產物。在某種意義上說，這是重慶國粹派對美國金融資本主義的讓步。</p>
<p>問：重慶對美國的讓步，從今而後將有愈演愈烈的趨勢，所以歸根結底重慶將成爲美國的殖民地。爲了對抗這一點，蘇聯與中共間的關係，愈結愈深，因而重慶豈不是將分爲蘇聯化中國與美國化中國的兩部份麼？</p>
<p>答：在我的面前，最好少用不値一顧的宣傳家口吻，我不願聽這類話。假如「民族國家」之爲物，是經濟學上的範圍，結果則會因經濟地盤之發生變化，而或隱或現。因爲中國的資本主義，並沒有防止美國資本主義侵入的充分任何經濟地盤，痛恨死中共工農大眾的經濟地盤種，也毫無拒絕蘇聯共產主義理論的理由。職是之故，假如單純經濟鬥爭會決定歷史的話，那末重慶地盤只有成爲美國化中國與蘇聯化中國的戰塲，而無他途可尋。然而目前，沒有一個中國人是爲蘇聯化中國或爲美國化中國而戰爭的。同時，在和平區內，也沒有一個純正中國人是爲日本化中國而戰爭的。目的全都是爲中國的獨立自主而戰爭。這就是「民族國家」的特色。因此，民族這個名詞，又成爲問題了。馬克斯主義者認爲民族「是以資本主義發展的因素而發生而形成的，所以民族的差別將隨着資本主義的滅亡，而自然消逝」（史太林著民族論，因手頭無比書，只好憑記憶寫出）。但無論如何不能不承認，「民族差別的消滅，首先是一件長期工作，而只有在將來社會改造的條件下方能實現」（米丁Mitin著唯物論辭典）。</p>
<p>民族結成的要素，爲言語·領土·經濟生活以及心理習慣等的共同性。此等要素，全屬後天性的，然而日本民族，或中華民族這樣由血液共同性所結成的民族，其「血液」要素，決非後天性的。這一要素，也將隨着資本主義的滅亡而消逝麼？現在姑且假定結成民族的其他要素，完全消逝，那末亞洲人的集團和白色人種的集團，會完全消逝任何心理對立關係而結合起來麼？現在我們把美國的實例，放在民族問題的實騐室裏來分析一下。誠然，美國人民中間的德國系美國人，英國系美國人和俄國系美國人間，巳經沒有差別了。然而亞洲系美國人，黑種人系美國人和白種人系美國人間，是否也沒有「民族」上的差別。姑且說它不是民族上的差別，但在社會待遇上，或社會心理上，不鞥說完全沒有人種上的差別觀念。假令中國劃入美國的世界裏，或蘇聯的世界裏，而這樣人種上的差別觀念可以立刻保證削除的話，我毫無疑議。但我認爲子啊那種情形下，人種上的差別觀念仍將繼續成爲一種社會上的輕視觀念。亞洲人和百種人間所存在的皮膚顏色不同，聖體不同等，就是這一社會上的輕視觀念之物質條件。馬克斯主義怎樣來理解這一物質條件呢？我認爲具有這樣先天性特徵的日本人和中國人，如不首先向全世界表示强大的威力，則彼輩百種人是不會輕易取消這一輕視觀念的。我認爲經騐過明治維新的日本人，以及目前在實行民族解放革命的中國人，全都很淸楚這一點。因此，凡具有良心的中國人，今日都不願籍日本力量來爭取獨立自主，都不願籍藉蘇聯力量來求得民族解放。他們始終想以自力更生，想以自力完成中國革命，以期中國擺出主人對奴隸的面孔來時，則應當立刻加以反抗，不要奴顏婢膝，逆來順受。這就是民族革命的精神。日本人必須在稍加信賴一下中國人的民族精神。日本人不必要擔心美國實力侵入重慶，更不必担心延安的政治影響因蘇聯勢力的膨脹而膨脹。令人担心者，只是日本人是否充分理解這一中國民族革命的精神。</p>
<p>一般人都說，今年是大東亞戰爭的決戰年。所謂決戰，決不是單純手拿武器的戰爭，也不是在後方單純奴隸於增加生產。假如今年日本人不理解這一中國革命精神，而不糾正妄自尊大的錯誤態度，則決戰年將只是日本人的決戰年，決不可能成爲整個亞洲民族的決戰年。而大東亞戰爭入不全體亞洲人實際參加，是不會輕易取得勝利的。日本人如完全主義到這一點時，方能打下大東亞戰爭勝利的基礎。（靖譯）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Enemy Warships in Lingayen Gulf: 23 Sunk and Destroyed; Japanese Ground Forces Courageously Counterattack <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Imperial General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 12th: (1) Enemy forces landing on the coast of Lingayen Gulf consist of approximately two infantry divisions and one tank division. Apart from some advances in front of San Fabian, they are consolidating their position near the coast and attempting to reinforce their strength. Japanese ground troops are courageously engaging in counterattacks. (2) Japanese air forces continue to fiercely attack enemy warships near Lingayen Gulf. The confirmed results of the battles on January 9th and 10th are as follows: one transport ship sunk by bombing, two cruisers sunk by bombing, two transport ships sunk, one aircraft carrier sunk, one cruiser sunk, and two cruisers or destroyers sunk. Seven transport ships, one aircraft carrier, two aircraft carriers or battleships, one battleship, and two cruisers heavily damaged and on fire.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Under the cover of intense artillery bombardment and aerial bombing, the American enemy finally landed between San Fabian and Lingayen in Lingayen Gulf on the morning of the 9th. Further, on the morning of the 10th, they landed with strong follow-up forces, attempting to expand their beachhead and are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese defending forces. Since around 1:00 PM on the 10th, the enemy forces, using numerous landing craft filled with approximately 2,000 soldiers, attempted a new landing at Lapun (approximately ten kilometers north of San Fabian). At this time, the Japanese ground forces lying in wait launched a fierce barrage against the enemy flotilla, resulting in the sinking of seven or eight large craft carrying tanks and numerous other craft, completely shattering the enemy's landing attempt. After suffering a major blow, the enemy retreated in disarray, and the morale of the Japanese troops to annihilate the enemy is soaring. The spirit of engaging in surprise attacks has shocked the enemy. Currently, the enemy forces are concentrating their landing forces in San Fabian, focusing on covering the landing of follow-up forces and attempting to strengthen their beachhead, preparing to launch a major offensive centered on their superior tank forces. Therefore, the great decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces in Lingayen Gulf is about to begin.</p>
<p>Fierce Close Combat Unfolds Near San Fabian</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the American enemy landing forces landed in Lingayen Gulf, they attempted to expand their beachhead centered on San Fabian in the Gulf on the 10th. At the same time, enemy warships in the Gulf continued to bombard fiercely with artillery, and mobilized their total air power in the area to attack Japanese positions. The Japanese forces also adopted an offensive strategy, launching fierce counterattacks with elite units. On the afternoon of the 10th, starting at 4:00 PM, the enemy forces, spearheaded by numerous tanks and supported by artillery, began attacking eastward from San Fabian. At 6:40 PM, a portion of the enemy forces broke into a corner of the Japanese positions. In response, the Japanese immediately moved their rear forces forward and, after engaging the enemy in fierce close combat, drove them out of the positions. Subsequently, after an even more intense concentrated artillery barrage, the enemy once again advanced on the Japanese positions with tanks as the vanguard. The Japanese forces repeatedly counterattacked. The enemy has now established a foothold in a portion of the Japanese protruding corner position, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the surrounding area. Meanwhile, since the enemy's landing, Japanese commando teams have launched night and day raids on the enemy, successively destroying the enemy's artillery fire. Due to the large number of enemy aircraft, they repeatedly used fighters and bombers to attack Japanese positions and ammunition depots. Enemy warships in the Gulf also fired flares while continuing their artillery bombardment. Therefore, Lingayen Gulf has now become a scene of tragic and unparalleled decisive battle.</p>
<p>Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Units Heavily Damage Enemy Warships</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Army Special Attack Unit "Mount Fuji Team" attacked an enemy mobile force operating northwest of Bolinao on the west coast of Lingayen Gulf at dawn on the 10th. According to reports from Japanese escort aircraft, they hit two large enemy ships, possibly aircraft carriers or battleships, causing them to explode violently. Another Japanese Special Attack Unit further penetrated the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf on the same afternoon, ramming three enemy transport ships, causing them to be heavily damaged and set on fire. That evening, another Japanese Special Attack Unit attacked an enemy mobile force cruising in the Gulf, hitting one of their aircraft carriers. As confirmed by Japanese escort aircraft, the enemy ship exploded violently and then sank.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A Japanese "Kamikaze" Special Attack Unit penetrated Lingayen Gulf on the 9th, heavily damaging one enemy battleship, two cruisers, and large destroyers.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Form Commando Units, Charge into Enemy Artillery Positions</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese elite troops engage in hand-to-hand combat against the invading enemy forces in Lingayen Gulf day and night, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At 2:30 PM on the 10th, a commando unit consisting of three men, including a sergeant, infiltrated the enemy's mortar position northeast of San Fabian amidst heavy artillery fire, destroying two of their barracks. All members returned safely. Also, a commando unit consisting of Sergeant Shirashima and three other men infiltrated the enemy's field artillery position east of San Fabian, which was under construction, at 10:30 AM on the 10th, destroying two field guns and several heavy machine guns.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy's first and second convoys, which invaded Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island, finally began landing on the morning of the 9th under heavy Japanese attacks. Afterwards, before dawn on the 10th, the enemy arrived in the Gulf again with over a hundred transport ships and approximately several dozen landing craft, heavily guarded by ten aircraft carriers. At this time, the Japanese air force stationed in the Philippines mobilized entirely and launched a tragic attack on the arrogant landing enemy. As a result, the enemy's first convoy, after being severely attacked by Japanese aircraft, had only two large ships and sixty landing craft remaining when it reached Lingayen Gulf on the 6th. The enemy, after suffering damage, abandoned the landing attempt. Furthermore, by the time the enemy's second convoy, consisting of over fifty transport ships and over two hundred landing craft, invaded the Gulf late at night, its losses had reached 40%. According to the enemy's recent tactics, they have adopted the principle of using a large number of small boats, attempting to evade the fierce attacks of Japanese special attack units. However, Japanese aircraft are specifically targeting the largest ones. The current battle has evolved into a land battle. On the Luzon front, Japanese forces are currently engaging the enemy in counterattacks in a portion of Lingayen Gulf. The Japanese army has extremely strong ground fortifications throughout Luzon Island. Therefore, in the second stage of the decisive battle on Luzon after the enemy's landing, it is inevitable that they will suffer a strong counterattack from the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Major Offensive and Defensive Battle Imminent in the Agno River Basin</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Special Attack Units continue to fiercely bomb the enemy fleet in Lingayen Gulf. According to a dispatch from an embedded Associated Press reporter on the 12th, Japanese aircraft and torpedo boats have launched night attacks on convoys transporting reinforcements for the US XIV Corps, hitting several enemy ships. However, the enemy, relying on their abundant supplies, continues to bring transport ships into Lingayen Gulf one after another, attempting to expand their beachhead. According to enemy sources, approximately 100,000 American and Australian troops, carrying over 10,000 tons of equipment and military supplies, have already landed. General MacArthur plans to move his main force south along the Manila Road into the central plains of Luzon, with the aim of engaging the main Japanese forces in a decisive battle. According to enemy sources, it is speculated that Japanese and American forces have successively arrived at the Agno River line from the south towards the Agno River. According to an Associated Press frontline dispatch, a portion of the US forces has reached the mouth of the Agno River, ten kilometers west of Lingayen, and is currently under heavy Japanese artillery fire, making the situation even more critical.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the US Pacific Seventh Fleet, Rear Admiral Barbey, Commander of the US Amphibious Forces, announced on the 11th that over 80,000 tons of supplies and equipment have been unloaded by US forces since the start of the Philippine operations.</p>

<p>Southwest Pacific Japanese Army Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese air forces are constantly attacking enemy airfields on Morotai Island, which has been invaded by the enemy and serves as a Philippine air force base, thwarting their attempts. From November 4th to January 1st, Japanese army air units launched sixty fierce attacks, achieving remarkable results. Enemy airfields were set on fire in 140 places, exploded in over 44 places, and numerous land-based supply depots were destroyed. Enemy aircraft losses include 153 aircraft set on fire (99 large aircraft, 28 medium aircraft, and 26 small aircraft), 128 enemy aircraft suffered light or heavy damage, and 2 enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>

<p>The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department in China held its regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Shioda, and advisors Lin Junfu and Wang Bingnan attended. Minister Matsushima spoke about the recent situation in the Pacific War. His remarks were as follows:</p>
<p>Landing Enemy Forces in Disarray</p>
<p>Regarding the recent situation in the Pacific War, since the end of December last year, Japanese air and naval forces in the Lingayen Gulf area have been cooperating to launch fierce attacks on the invading enemy forces. Relying on a large number of transport ships, the enemy arrived in Lingayen Gulf on the 8th of this month and began landing on the 9th. The enemy's forces from the south of Lingayen to the San Fabian area consist of approximately two divisions. After being fiercely attacked by Japanese ground and air forces, the enemy has fallen into a state of disarray. The enemy force assisting the landing troops has divided its forces into several groups, cruising on the eastern sea of Luzon Island. This mobile force mainly uses special aircraft carriers (i.e., aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships) for transportation. The warships protecting the mobile force, such as cruisers and destroyers, are few in number, so their combat power is also very low.</p>
<p>Closer to Japan, More Advantageous for Japan</p>
<p>MacArthur's headquarters is exaggerating the publicity for this operation, claiming to have occupied over thirty strongholds and is now actively advancing on Manila. All such claims are false. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 10th, the American troops landing on Luzon Island have advanced 18 to 20 miles from the landing site. During the journey of the American convoy of 2.5 million tons, Japanese special swimming teams were discovered engaging in fierce combat. From the surface perspective of the current battlefield, it seems that the Japanese are gradually being pushed back from Leyte Island through Mindoro Island to Luzon Island. However, from a strategic point of view, the closer to Japan and the wider the land, the more advantageous it is for Japan. That is, Japan can make the enemy bleed more and consume more in various battlefields, and annihilate them as close as possible to our homeland.</p>
<p>American Personnel Facing Great Difficulties</p>
<p>Regarding the heavy losses and severe damage suffered by the enemy in bleeding operations, according to Reuters from Washington on the 11th, US Undersecretary of War Patterson stated that 900,000 more troops must be added within six months this year in order to win the war, which shows the severity of the enemy's damage. When MacArthur was preparing to attack the Philippines, he had only 200,000 troops. Those who landed in Lingayen Gulf were only about 40,000 to 50,000, including a portion transferred from Leyte Island, where the enemy suffered great damage. At this time, when both sides are in a stalemate on Leyte Island, the enemy still needs to divert a portion of their forces to other places, and their personnel difficulties are clearly visible. Regarding the future Pacific War, the battle in the Philippines is said to be the final decisive battle of the Pacific War, and I also believe it to some extent. However, we will make the enemy suffer more bleeding and greater consumption within the possible range and advance according to our predetermined strategy. The closer the enemy gets to the Japanese mainland, the greater our hope. I have said this repeatedly before. In particular, we must prevent the enemy from coming to the Chinese mainland. This policy will never change.</p>
<p>Resolved to Fight to the End</p>
<p>In the current war situation, it is quite easy to cause public unrest in Shanghai, and this point should be paid special attention to. Secondly, the enemy is eager to conduct air raids on important cities in Shanghai and the peaceful areas. Based on the results of the air raids that have been proven in Changsha, Hengyang and other places, the United States carries out indiscriminate and blind bombings, and the greatest damage is to the lives and property of the Chinese people, which is extremely regrettable. On the evening of January 8, I broadcast to Chongqing and the peaceful areas, wanting to urge the Eastern nations to recognize the significance of this war and struggle. We have always been determined to fight this war to the end, so we are not afraid of enemy bombing at all. In any case, we want to minimize the damage to the lives and property of the Chinese people as much as possible. This is what we are extremely concerned about. Therefore, air defense preparations are extremely important, and the Chinese people should be advised to step up this kind of prevention work.</p>
<p>Location and Progress Unimportant</p>
<p>I believe that the enemy's combat methods are all "incomplete advance operations." For example, in the current war situation, the enemy is carrying out island-hopping operations in the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Palau Islands, etc., attempting to quickly reach the Chinese mainland. In short, the enemy's attempt is to disregard the foundations along the way and reach the Chinese mainland early to disrupt the Chinese army and cause chaos in Japan's construction on the mainland. Based on this, it is expected that in future operations, the enemy may ignore the situation in the Philippines and move towards the Chinese mainland. This cannot but be considered. This can make the enemy run east and west, consume everywhere, and finally destroy them, which is the best strategy. Those who do not understand warfare may easily misunderstand, but the final goal is to destroy the enemy, and the location and progress are not important. In short, we have the determination to win this war, make the enemy consume, and finally eliminate them. We have always had this confidence.</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Relationship Between the Chongqing Government and the Communists <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists was one of unity for resistance, but it began to split during the war of resistance. In recent years, they have each raised the flag of resistance while acting independently, creating a situation of internal strife. You oppose me, I restrain you, and neither yields to the other. The situation has escalated, and the division is always on the verge of erupting. People who care about China's future are very concerned about this issue. We would like to offer an analysis of this issue from an outsider's perspective.</p>
<p>The core of the relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists is that Chiang Kai-shek opposes the Communist Party's expansion of power during the war of resistance, while the Communist Party must develop during the war of resistance. Therefore, the anti-Communist issue has become one of the central tasks of the Kuomintang in Chongqing.</p>
<p>The issue of anti-Communism has been on the Chinese political stage for a long time. Everyone probably still remembers the famous ten-year campaign to suppress the Communists. It took five encirclement campaigns in Jiangxi to drive them out of their stronghold, and they fled back to northern Shaanxi in disarray. After the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to repay the Communist Party's kindness in not killing him, dismissed the ten-year resentment with a smile, shook hands, and accepted the Communist Party's proposal to resist Japan. The Communist Party, in return, abandoned class struggle, supported the program of resisting Japan and building the country, and formed the "National Anti-Japanese United Front" to jointly "resist Japan." The bloody issue of anti-Communism was written off, and the atmosphere of national unity reached its peak for a time.</p>
<p>However, grand feasts are hard to repeat, and good times don't last long. After the fall of Wuhan and the move to Chongqing, it was decided to engage in a long-term war of attrition. It was felt that one's own power had been greatly diminished during the two years of blind war, while the Communist Party had taken the opportunity to develop. Recalling the difficulties of the ten-year campaign to suppress the Communists, a deep fear arose, with a great sense of regret. However, one could not personally take down the anti-Japanese signboard and start another campaign of first securing the home front and then repelling foreign invaders. One could only formulate methods to restrict the activities of dissenting parties, secretly mobilize subordinates, and start grassroots friction, creating a situation of open suppression, which was very painful. The Southern Anhui Incident in the winter of 1940 was an attempt to lead the Chongqing government and the Communists back to the old path of the past sixteen years. However, Chiang Kai-shek's "two resistances" policy—resisting Japan on one hand and resisting the Communists on the other—bound his own hands and feet, leading to extreme contradictions and preventing any development. Although Chiang Kai-shek used 700,000 troops to blockade Yan'an for more than six years, there was no good opportunity to directly attack Yan'an and uproot the Communist Party. In the fall of the year before last, the Soviet Union announced the dissolution of the Third International, which was a rare opportunity. Hu Zongnan wanted to lead his elite troops to annihilate them in one fell swoop, and the situation was very serious. The Communist Party quickly raised the old fist of "unity to resist Japan" to parry, and only then did Chiang Kai-shek strike back into the contradictions of resisting Japan, close the shop, and get through the crisis.</p>
<p>However, Chiang Kai-shek did not give up. He wanted to use the fist of "victory in the war of resistance" to retaliate against the Communist Party. Therefore, in his speech on the Double Tenth Festival last year, he emphasized that victory in the war of resistance must have unified military orders, and in front of the people of the whole country, he denounced the Communist Party's "possession of troops and territorial division" as undermining the unity of military orders, which was "treacherous and deceitful." This kind of scolding can be said to be very pleasant, but it is doubtful that it will incite a full-scale anti-Communist campaign, which Chiang Kai-shek probably did not consider. When Chiang Kai-shek learned to use the "anti-Japanese flag" as a bomb to attack the Communist Party, the Communist Party invented a new weapon to counterattack, which was to use the military setbacks of the Chongqing government and the pressure from the United States to blackmail Chongqing and fundamentally remove the political anti-Communist weapon of the Chongqing government. Therefore, it openly proposed a "coalition government" with the participation of all parties and factions. The demand for a "joint command" was getting closer and closer, with even the intention of sharing power equally.</p>
<p>In order to counter this, the Chongqing government changed some of the personnel that American public opinion was dissatisfied with in order to appease the United States and ease diplomatic pressure. In domestic politics, it avoided giving the Communist Party an excuse to attack and bewitch the people, and strived for the people's belief. In his New Year's Day broadcast this year, he claimed: "As long as the military situation stabilizes and the foundation for counterattack is established, the constitution will be announced and power will be returned to the people." The Yan'an side gave a fierce condemnation of Chiang's pledge of an empty check, thoroughly exposing its deceptive nature in front of the people of the country. At the same time, it listed facts to refute it and raised practical issues to accuse it. Today's relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists is a tit-for-tat struggle. What are they fighting for? They are fighting for the people. A tooth-for-tooth fight, what are they fighting for? They are fighting for the "coalition government" and the "joint command." Looking at the speech by Lin Zuhan, the Yan'an representative at the Chongqing-Communist negotiation conference, that "the Communist Party has tens of thousands of regular troops and tens of thousands of militia," the purpose of which was to demand an equal division of foreign aid. But the implication was that it was demonstrating to the Chongqing government, meaning that it would not stop until its goal was achieved.</p>
<p>The Chongqing government has indeed made some achievements in its work of unification during the protracted war, but it has lost more than it has gained, emboldening the Communist Party. Now it is still stuck in the horn of a dilemma in the protracted war of anti-Communism, which is really a foolish thing. To understand the relationship between the Chongqing government and the Communists, the key lies in this.</p>

<p>Burma Front Base, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese new fighter squadrons on the Burma front heavily bombed enemy transport fleets in Japanese Creek on the 9th, achieving great results. When the new Japanese fighter formation arrived in the skies over Japanese Creek Harbor, it was just as the enemy was transporting soldiers and weapons for landing. The enemy transport fleet anchored in the harbor consisted of cruisers arranged in two parallel rows. At this time, after the Japanese aircraft circled in the air, the lead aircraft of the front team first carried out a dive bombing of the large enemy cruiser. The first bomb hit the deck squarely, and the enemy cruiser exploded one after another. At the same time, the enemy, after being ambushed by Japanese aircraft, blindly fired anti-aircraft fire from ships and ground. In this situation of smoke-filled air, the Japanese fighter squadrons dropped a large number of huge bombs on the enemy fleet. When another Japanese aircraft soared to the skies over the bay, it flew into the enemy transport fleet and destroyed a large ship with a heavy bomb. At this time, a large enemy transport ship of the thousand-ton class was seen leaking heavy oil due to injury. Furthermore, on its return trip, the Japanese aircraft shot down two small enemy fighters. In this operation, the Japanese fighters also sacrificed three aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Students Complete the Mission of Production <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>From Classroom to Factory</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese students from various schools have entered factories from the classroom in order to take on the national wartime production work, and have become the mainstay of military industrial labor. Their enthusiasm for serving the country can be said to have reached its peak. The following is an example of these wartime students working hard in factories. At a certain factory in Tokyo that produces various chemical industries, everything from the initial construction of the factory was undertaken by the students. Recently, they have been working in three shifts day and night, so the production results are far superior to those of ordinary factories. The large factory, which has an area of 75 acres and large-scale equipment, was actually completed entirely by students' hands to fulfill the mission of the production war. Moreover, these students are all of middle school level or below. Their work has been carried out since September last year, first engaging in the production of synthetic rubber, and starting at the end of December, starting the manufacture of carbolic acid. Among them, the organization of diligent students is that fifth-year and third-year middle school students serve as captains of each detachment, and each detachment member is composed of 15 elementary school students. Before the start of work every day, all members must first gather together, sing "We have received many lands from the country," call out the slogan "We will definitely win," and then the whole team marches into the factory to work. Their spirit of dedication and law-abiding reflects the struggle of the soldiers on the front line.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Botanist Studies New Wheat Species <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A teacher at a certain Japanese school has recently used the cross-breeding of wheat species to research and complete a new, huge wheat variety. This summer, 100,000 grains of seeds have been harvested and formal planting has begun. The researcher is Mr. Nakajima Goichi, a 44-year-old contract worker in the Faculty of Agriculture at Kyoto University, who is a teacher at the Prefectural Kiryu Doshi High Museum in Kiryu City, Gunma Prefecture. This wheat is a crossbreed of wheat and naked rye, which was considered impossible among past scholars. Compared with wheat No. 16, its wheat grains are three times larger, the number of grains per ear is 150 (ordinary is 50), the length of the ear is about 10 cm longer than ordinary, and the wheat base is about 10 cm-20 cm. The quality of this grain is not much different from ordinary wheat. The teacher named it "Fixed Species Naked Wheat." The characteristics of this giant wheat are the same as naked rye, but it can grow well in barren mountainous areas or dry, barren land, and fertilizer is almost not needed. The research of this wheat took 19 years. Initially, it could only flower without bearing ears every year, and it took nine years before a pot of ears finally appeared.</p>

<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports that German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an article in the "German Weekly," stating that this war is a social revolution, and the winners will be the workers, not the bankers and capitalists. The tide of socialism will flood all countries after the war. The political goals of the anti-Axis powers are very vague. The people of plutocratic countries lack political ideals and will face political failure after the war. The people in the occupied areas of the anti-Axis armies are experiencing political instability, famine, and domestic struggles. These are the results of ideological conflicts between revolutionaries and conservatives, and a proper solution cannot be reached. The German people have already experienced the revolutions that other countries are currently facing. Germany has not changed its basic ideals for this war over the years. The German people understand the historical significance of this war and recognize the war goals, thus generating the strength to overcome the various difficulties of the war. The German people use the war goals as their compass.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Holding a Firmly Confident Heart of Victory, Exerting Full Effort to Assist the Allied Nations, Vowing to be the Backing for the Brave Soldiers on the Luzon Front <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a statement released by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters at 10 AM on the 10th: The enemy American forces finally landed on San Fabian and near Lingayen on the south coast of Lingayen Gulf on the 9th. The decisive battle for Luzon Island, which will determine the fate of the Pacific, has now begun. Currently, fierce artillery fire is still raging there, and intense naval and air battles are unfolding. The valiant fighting of the Japanese army, navy, and air force special attack units has already inflicted heavy damage on the stubborn enemy. Furthermore, the enemy Americans' landing in Lingayen Gulf this time is using the same old trick as the landing in Leyte Gulf, adopting a feint to the east and attack to the west strategy to divert the Japanese army's attention. The Japanese army has long seen through this trick and, in addition to establishing an impregnable defense posture on the Philippine Islands, is also using a unified combat will of the army, navy, and air force to stand in strict formation and await to shatter the enemy American's attempts. Therefore, the enemy American's operation to cut off the Japanese army's connection with the southern regions of the mainland will ultimately suffer another miserable defeat under the divine might of the Japanese army. However, the enemy Americans, with their superior quantity of materials and desire for dominance, will not necessarily change their plans even if the offensive against the Philippine Islands is frustrated as a result. This is what everyone expects, so the seriousness of the situation in the Philippine Islands cannot be underestimated. However, our entire nation is extremely angry about the historical fact of the enemy Americans enslaving the people of East Asia and their stubborn ambition. Therefore, after the news of the enemy American's landing in Lingayen Gulf reached us, our spirit of unity has become even stronger. Holding the same righteous and firmly confident heart of victory, we should exert all our strength in this autumn of decisive battle to assist our allied nations in striking the enemy Americans. Moreover, in fact, the Japanese army is in a position of fighting on the inner line. The shorter the battle line, the more concentrated the military strength. The enemy Americans are in a position of fighting on the outer line. The longer the battle line, the more serious the problem of transportation and supply becomes. The Japanese army is in a superior position of natural defense, possessing abundant supplies and a steady supply of military strength, waiting at ease for the enemy to tire themselves out. There is absolutely no doubt that they will be victorious. The enemy Americans are exhausted and rushing to end the war against Japan, even resorting to unscrupulous means and disregarding sacrifices to penetrate deep into the Japanese army's positions. The Japanese army can seize the opportunity to exploit the enemy's plan to penetrate deep, and then annihilate them in unison. At this moment, in addition to strengthening our belief in certain victory in the Philippine Islands, we should also exert all our manpower and material resources to assist the war of the allied nations, to be the backing for the brave soldiers on the Philippine front, in order to achieve the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Agricultural Experiment Station's Work Plan for This Year: Emphasis on Food and Livestock Products <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is an agricultural technology research institution. As the food production increase campaign is being actively promoted, and experimental work is particularly important, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the station yesterday to inquire about the implementation plan for this year's work. The explanation was as follows:</p>
<p>This year's work plan of the station intends to place emphasis on edible crops and livestock improvement. In terms of experimental crops, the work will be divided into agronomy, animal husbandry, and plant pest and disease control. Agronomic crops will focus on hemp, and winter crops will focus on wheat and vegetables. In terms of animal husbandry, the focus will be on improving the breeds of poultry and livestock, formulating feed, preventing epidemics, and expanding livestock farms for raising pigs, chickens, and draft animals. In terms of plant pests and diseases, the main research items will be rice locusts (armyworms and stored product pests), rice blight, black smut, cotton wilt, etc., and it is planned to train instructors and establish instructor training classes. Furthermore, it is planned to expand rural social undertakings, operate rural clinics, people's schools, people's reading rooms, cooperatives, etc., which are directly or indirectly related to the experimental work, and to add branch stations. Moreover, in order to promote agricultural cooperation, the management of specially contracted farm households will be strengthened. Regarding equipment replenishment, it is planned to establish a chemical laboratory, construct five warehouses and workshops each, repair greenhouses, establish a breeding livestock farm, and add agricultural tools.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the implementation of the National Government's economic control measures, the anticipated results have not been achieved. The reasons are: (1) the lack of accurate statistics; (2) the imperfection of the methods of the control agencies. Regarding the former, due to the lack of accurate statistics on population, production, and consumption, there is no definite policy. Regarding the latter, due to the lack of unity of the control agencies, the power is dispersed, and each acts independently. For example, although the procurement agencies nominally have their own responsibilities, in reality, there are many constraints, which is a prominent example. All of these situations are unfavorable maladies that hinder the advancement of the control measures. At this decisive stage, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power, it is indeed necessary to emphasize that the economic control measures are not working. Therefore, people across the country are paying close attention to this issue and expecting improvements. After inquiring with relevant parties, the reporter has learned that the authorities are carefully studying improvement measures aimed at the above-mentioned maladies, and a formal decision will be made in the near future. This new countermeasure for controlled economy will surely bring about epoch-making progress in stabilizing people's livelihoods and economic combat power.</p>

<p>Berlin, 11th (German News Agency dispatch) – According to an official German war report: In order to effectively support the flank of the Allied forces' deep advance in the Ardennes salient in northeastern France, the German army has pulled back the line from the salient on the west bank of the Ourthe River in southeastern Belgium and withdrawn from the city of Saint-Hubert. The German army was not subjected to enemy pressure. Although the enemy army stubbornly attempted to move north in the Bastogne area, the battle line did not change much. After several days of fighting, the German army in Lorraine has occupied Rimling north of Rohrbach. The German army in the Rhine plain swept through the Maginot Line fortifications near Hagenthal, and has captured several villages and towns in central Alsace. The enemy army was surrounded by the German army in Kilstett and then annihilated. The German army's long-range artillery fire on Liège and Antwerp has become increasingly fierce, disrupting the enemy army's supply.</p>

<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Soviet army has resumed its attack on Kispest and Szebely, the southeastern suburbs of Hongjing (Budapest), and is using fire teams to assist in the battle. However, it has not yet achieved its purpose. Other Soviet troops have been transferred to the west of Hongjing to prevent the German army from advancing towards the Bakony Forest and the Vértes Mountains. The Soviet army's failure in the large-scale tank battle in Székesfehérvár has allowed the German army to advance all the way to the Danube River. The German army's counter-offensive in Vértes and Pilis Mountains has advanced eastward. The Soviet army's breakthrough west of the Gran River has met with strong German resistance, so the battle of Hongjing has been favorable to the German-Hungarian forces. The German army's offensive northwest of Budapest has forced the Soviet army to temporarily abandon its offensive against Hongjing.</p>

<p>Zurich, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a statement released by the British Air Force authorities: In 1944, the British Air Force dropped a total of 525,000 tons of bombs on Germany, equivalent to two and a half times the amount of bombs dropped in the first four and a half years since the outbreak of the war. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Spaatz of the US Army, commander of the US Strategic Bombing Force in Europe, also stated that the US Air Force dispatched to Europe last year dropped 998,000 tons of bombs in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Combining the above two figures, the total is 1.5 million tons. According to a Swedish magazine, although the Allied air force has carried out such large-scale bombing, it has not achieved victory. On the contrary, the German side has thoroughly evacuated factories and placed them underground, rendering the enemy army's bombing operations ineffective.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 11th (German News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Washington: President Roosevelt held a meeting with the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that the meeting between the President and Churchill and Stalin was also an example of the topics discussed.</p>
<p>Various Speculations on the Topics of Discussion</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry pointed out that although several locations have been proposed for the next meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, Tehran is the most likely. It is still undecided whether Roosevelt is preparing to consult with Churchill in London first to prepare for the discussion of the three giants. The date of the meeting has not been set either. There will be no lack of issues to discuss, such as the political issues of Greece and Poland, and the Near East oil issue, all of which can be used as discussion materials. However, Berlin believes that the topic of discussion should be the future European political system. The Moscow-published "War and the Working Class" magazine recently pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot tolerate the existence of pre-war governments in the occupied areas. This statement is veiled and worthy of careful consideration.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Huitong News Agency reports: Washington news, representatives of American oil companies will hold a meeting with representatives of the State Department and the Department of the Interior on January 15 to discuss the amendments to the Anglo-American oil agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Song Ziwen's Entry into the Cabinet and Chongqing's Unease <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Question: Today I have many questions to ask you. You previously said that He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were the pillars of Chiang Kai-shek's regime, and their decline proves Chiang Kai-shek's own decline. However, since Song Ziwen became the Premier of the Executive Yuan, everyone naturally understands that Chongqing's political arena has gradually become the domain of the Anglo-American faction. So, please first explain the process of Song Ziwen's ascent to power.</p>
<p>Answer: The Premier of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing was originally Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek was consistently preoccupied with military affairs, and in fact, all affairs were solely controlled by the Vice Premier, Kong Xiangxi. As for this year, as Chiang Kai-shek said, China is in a decisive year where military matters take precedence. Therefore, since the end of last year, they have been racking their brains to study this issue. Finally, they decided to have a specialized talent appointed as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, while he himself would concentrate on military affairs. Of course, there are still talents in Chongqing, but very few are capable of taking on the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan. Everyone knows that although the current Chongqing regime is said to be a party-state, it is not controlled by the Kuomintang, but by the Chiang family and a few other families directly affiliated with Chiang. In essence, it is not the Chinese government, but the Chiang family's government. Therefore, the selection of individuals for such an important position as the Premier of the Executive Yuan is greatly restricted. First, looking at the individuals within the current Chongqing regime who could potentially be candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan, even with a relaxed standard, there are at most only Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Zhang Qun, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and He Yingqin. Among these people, from the perspective of possessing the ability and qualifications to be Chiang's Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen is the most suitable. Honestly, it is precisely because Song Ziwen is overly qualified and capable that he has never been the Premier of the Executive Yuan until now. Although Chiang Kai-shek is known for his magnanimity in tolerating opposition, he cannot escape the common flaws of a "dictator." Ordinary dictators are cowards. Although they are said to be cowards, it does not mean they fear "death." To protect their personal power, they are always suspicious and fear that someone will compete for "their" power. Although Chiang Kai-shek is a dictator, he is different from dictators like Stalin and Hitler. His dictatorial foundation is built on the balance of power among various factions (please see my book "Further Discussion on the Chongqing Regime"), so his level of paranoia is the greatest. Chiang Kai-shek will never allow anyone around him to exist who can rival his power. Although Song Ziwen is not Chiang Kai-shek's opponent in terms of ability and qualifications, as Anglo-American pressure increases universally around the world, a group of people gradually gathers around Song Ziwen, such as Wang Zhengting, Gu Weijun, Wang Chonghui, Guo Taiqi, and Chen Guangfu, all of whom are not directly affiliated with Chiang Kai-shek and are supporting Song Ziwen. Chiang Kai-shek cannot help but pay attention to this. This is one reason why Chiang Kai-shek has not heavily relied on Song Ziwen. However, today, Chiang Kai-shek is already in a situation where he cannot "do as he pleases" or think "I am the state."</p>
<p>Question: What exactly is the situation that forces Chiang Kai-shek to let Song Ziwen succeed as Premier of the Executive Yuan?</p>
<p>Answer: First, there is the issue of dealing with the United States. Chongqing is superficially fulfilling the democratic demands of the United States by partially reorganizing the government, replacing He Yingqin with Chen Cheng as Minister of Military Affairs, and replacing Kong Xiangxi with Yu Hongjun as Minister of Finance. However, such reorganization, as pointed out by the Moscow government newspaper "Izvestia" (December 2nd), is entirely a "pretentious" reorganization. The United States is very dissatisfied with this superficial reorganization, so to deal with Chongqing's perfunctory attitude, the United States directly exchanged military delegations with the Chinese Communist Party. This is what Chiang Kai-shek fears most. Chiang Kai-shek's greatest opponent is not Japan, but the Chinese Communist Party. He believes that although Japan is strong, it can be dealt with by the United States. As for the Chinese Communist Party, he must deal with it himself. But contrary to his wishes, the United States recognized the existence of the political power of the Chinese Communist Party, not only exchanging military observation groups with them, but also having the US Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, personally visit the Yan'an government, attempting to resolve the Kuomintang-Communist issue. Chiang Kai-shek is not stupid. He knows that adopting the same hard-line policy towards the United States' emphasis on Yan'an is harmful and brings no benefit. Therefore, he brought out Song Ziwen, who is favored by the Americans.</p>
<p>Second, there is the relationship with the war situation. The Chongqing government stated in the December 18th edict to the press: "Chongqing hopes that the United States will land on the Chinese mainland before the complete recapture of the Philippines. The early landing of American troops on the Chinese coast is in accordance with the unanimous demands of all the Allied countries." Chiang Kai-shek also feels that he cannot cope with the current war situation on his own. Originally, Chiang Kai-shek did not want American troops to land. It would be a highly desirable thing for American troops to land in China and fight to the death with Japanese troops, but the future is frightening. Aesop's fable "The Horse's Revenge" tells the story of a horse seeking help from a man to take revenge on a deer. The man rode the horse to chase the deer and finally killed it. However, later, the man realized that the horse was the most useful animal, so he used the horse as a means of transportation. This is the author's beginning of a Western pun on "horse-deer" (which in Japanese means foolish). Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek is cautiously and vigilantly guarding against Chongqing imitating the story of the horse relying on man to kill the deer. However, the situation has reached such an urgent stage that it does not allow for considering the future. Currently, the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army and the Northern Expeditionary Army departing from Annam have completely converged in Huanlu, Guangxi Province, on December 10th. As a result, the Third, Fourth, and Seventh War Zones have been completely cut off from communication with Chongqing. The military situation in these three war zones is very clear: Chongqing has neither the strength nor the will to break through the Japanese defense line and open up a supply line. Their only hope is for American troops to land on the southern coast and establish a supply line from the sea. Otherwise, these three war zones will not be able to sustain themselves. They certainly know that the Japanese army will not launch large-scale operations against the Third and Fourth War Zones, but when Chongqing's troops are cut off from their supply lines, soldiers often turn into bandits and commit crimes among the people. Of course, Chongqing has never been afraid of its own soldiers committing crimes among the people, but what Chongqing fears most is that the Chinese Communist Party will take this opportunity to show goodwill to the people, highlight the evil of the Chongqing army, and win over the hearts of the people in these two war zones to establish a consolidated regime. Looking at the examples of northern Jiangsu and Shandong, after Chongqing's troops are cut off from their supply lines, they cannot survive and will self-destruct, but in such war zones, the strength of the Chinese Communist Party rapidly develops. This trend is currently manifesting itself significantly in various parts of Zhejiang Province. To prevent this trend, Chongqing has to welcome American troops to land. Even if the landing of American troops is harmful to China's independence and autonomy, it is not an immediate harm. For a debilitated opium addict, stopping the supply of opium will lead to death. Therefore, for such a terminally ill opium addict, even knowing that opium is poisonous, one has no choice but to supply it. To save itself from the current crisis, Chongqing, knowing that the landing of American troops is harmful, has no choice but to hope for it. As Chongqing has such a weakness, the United States wants to take full advantage of this weakness. As for the landing operation, it has never given Chongqing a definite date, deliberately making Chongqing anxious, thereby the United States wants to force Chongqing to make a political concession. Chongqing is now truly like ants on a hot pan and has fallen into the trap of the United States. This is the second reason for Chongqing's further reorganization.</p>
<p>Third, there is the demand for Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. The Japanese army has already entered the territory of Guizhou Province, posing a threat to the heart of Chongqing. The UP correspondent stationed in Chongqing, with keen senses, even predicted that Chongqing's fate would be decided within two months. Chiang Kai-shek also increasingly felt the thorniness of the issue, so he transferred Hu Zongnan's mechanized forces of 300,000, which had consistently been surrounding the CCP, to reinforce and take on the defense of Chongqing. As a result, the actual pressure from Chongqing on the CCP has been greatly reduced, imperceptibly. As a result, the CCP's attitude seems to have become even more justified. Today, Chiang Kai-shek can only rely on political compromise to suppress the CCP. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards the CCP is no longer the openly unreasonable and insincere Kuomintang-Communist cooperation negotiations that it used to be. Now Chiang Kai-shek has to pretend to be sincere. To put on a show, he has to put figures trusted by the CCP in prominent positions in the Chongqing regime. Currently, the politicians most trusted by the CCP in Chongqing are only Song Ziwen and Sun Ke. The CCP calls these two the two liberals of Chongqing. However, the time for Sun Ke to rise to prominence has not yet arrived. Moreover, the current stage of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation negotiations is showing a triangular relationship between the CCP, the United States, and Chongqing. Therefore, Song Ziwen, who has considerable relationships with all three of the above, is truly the most suitable figure. This is the third reason why Song Ziwen was appointed as Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Question: After Song Ziwen takes power, is there hope for improvement in Kuomintang-Communist cooperation in the near future?</p>
<p>Answer: Before discussing this issue, we need to first examine Song Ziwen's character. Let's leave aside the question of whether Song Ziwen is a capable financier. It is enough to explain his position on the Chinese revolution. I believe that he, like most wealthy intellectuals, is a "coward" when it comes to social revolution. This is by no means my personal opinion. Just mentioning his attitude towards the Wuhan Revolution will make it clear. Vincent Sheean, the American journalist who encouraged Song Ziwen to participate in the Wuhan government at the time, wrote in his diary:</p>
<p>"Song Ziwen is very smart and can understand that the true successor of the Kuomintang is the Wuhan government, not Chiang Kai-shek's warlord dictatorship (at least he said so). Although he has been threatened and tempted, he has always refused to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's government. His residence is often under surveillance by secret agents, so he has become a very nervous person. He has never stepped out of the French Concession and the Public Concession. Because Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen are everywhere in Chinese-controlled areas, there is always the possibility of being arrested. If Chiang Kai-shek catches him, he will either be the Minister of Finance or go to jail, one or the other. I don't believe they would kill him, but he is worried about this. He is truly a coward of the first order. And the proposal I brought from Hankou is a way to save him from this predicament. He immediately agreed and asked me to buy a ticket on the same ship as me for a Cantonese man named Zai. He repeatedly asked about the situation in Hankou.</p>
<p>The next day, he changed his mind. He changed his mind after discussing it with his mother, sisters, and brother-in-law. His family is extremely reactionary. He nervously became neurotic and said: 'I have no reason to go to Hankou. You know that I am not a social revolutionary, I hate revolution, I do not believe in revolution. When the labor and peasant policies force merchants and industrialists to stop operating, how can I balance the budget, how can I issue currency? I cannot convince the Central Executive Committee...' This change of mind dominated his mind for a week. I think this is the greatest manifestation of his typical liberal wavering" (Personal History: By Vincent Sheean P.254-255).</p>
<p>Anna Louise Strong, who was close to Song Ziwen in the same era as Vincent Sheean, also made the same comment about Song Ziwen:</p>
<p>"Song Ziwen was born to be a conservative industrialist, having studied at Harvard University in the United States. He naturally likes industrialists and hates communists and workers. His obvious future is to be an industrialist in Shanghai. If he had met the Kuomintang advisor, the Russian Borodin, and not been influenced by him, he would definitely be a wealthy industrialist in Shanghai. The revolution has given Song Ziwen power and the opportunity to build national finances. What destroys his achievements and deprives him of his property are the warlords. Therefore, Song Ziwen hates communists and also hates warlords. As for building a national bank, the communists have a good attitude, and the worst and most unreasonable are the warlords. Although the Wuhan government cannot satisfy his desires, it has given him the opportunity to create national finances. And the Wuhan government is holding high the banner of the people's government against the warlords. So he hopes to go to Wuhan and see the success of Wuhan. And he knows that his mission is calling him. But he did not go to Wuhan. Because he has too deep personal relationships with Chiang Kai-shek and the merchants of Shanghai.</p>
<p>He said to me: 'Go up the Yangtze River as soon as possible! There is nothing to hear and nothing to see in Nanjing. Everywhere there are colorful slogans and the old corruption of China. Wuhan is the opposite of Nanjing, full of meaningful social experiments.' He repeatedly sent letters to Sun Yat-sen's wife Song Qingling and his old friend Borodin, saying that he would go to Wuhan as soon as he could escape Chiang Kai-shek's eyes and ears. ... He seemed to want to do this sincerely. He has his personal difficulties. But the last time he met me, he unconsciously said: 'Goodbye! We will meet in Beijing! Farewell for now.' Based on this sentence, I knew the path he should take. He is prepared to wait until he understands that everything is safest in terms of life and reputation."</p>
<p>There are countless materials explaining his character. I am just selecting one or two observations from Americans who were particularly close to him from countless materials to narrate. Of course, a person often progresses through cultivation. The current Song Ziwen may be more mature and sophisticated than the Song Ziwen of fifteen years ago. Although his social status has become increasingly solid, I have never heard of any revolutionary transformation in his thinking. It is true that he has had considerable understanding of the CCP since the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is a fact. But I think this is a bluff made to counter Chiang Kai-shek's dislike of him. If Song Ziwen really has this character, wouldn't he be able to use his courage and personality to make the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party unprecedentedly better?</p>
<p>Question: Then does Song Ziwen's assumption of the premiership have no political significance at all?</p>
<p>Answer: On the contrary, it has great political significance. It is the most significant event reflecting the current world situation. As you know, the anti-Axis side believes that the current question is whether the world belongs to the Soviet Union or to the United States. This either/or question was discussed by the general public long after the end of World War I. In 1928, Edgar Mowrer wrote on the second page of his book "This American World":</p>
<p>"Europe in the past has determined the fate of most of humanity on Earth. However, at present, Europe is gradually losing this decisiveness. Modern Europeans are not comparable to their past era of self-satisfaction and swaggering. The great ideas of Europe, of course, are still radiating light, but it is in the distant, dense clouds. Most of humanity openly admits that what they expect in their subconscious, 'a new culture, a new religion, a new spirit,' may be seen not in the Soviet Union but in the United States, these two absolutely opposite fields of different spirits. However, the Soviet Union has not yet fully grown its feathers and is still developing. And the other, the United States, has already stood out from the crowd. Because of this, the leaders of the Soviet Union are looking for samples of material development in the United States."</p>
<p>Mowrer wrote this book in 1928. Sixteen years have now passed. During this period, the Soviet Union has grown into adulthood, and the "Bobbit" civilization of the United States has reached maturity. What is particularly obvious in the recent world situation is the struggle and compromise between these two forces. Can these two forces compromise? Or will a head-on conflict occur in the near future? This question is the greatest force affecting the current World War. Of course, everyone wants to end this World War II as soon as possible, but the fact is that it is still far from over. As for whether World War II will be followed by World War III, or whether it will break out again after a longer or shorter period of stability, this is the crux of the matter. When Mr. Chen Youren was alive, I often discussed this question with him. Based on the trends of several meetings between the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, he believed that the two forces might reach some kind of agreement, so he thought there would be a considerable period of stability. As for me, I think that the current Soviet Union is indeed working hard to strive for a certain degree of agreement on dividing the spheres of influence in the world. This kind of agreement may be established. But this kind of agreement, to use a metaphor, is equivalent to an agreement using the riverbank as the dividing line between land and sea. The riverbank is constantly changing due to high and low tides, so what is currently called land becomes the riverbank itself during high tide. Specifically, after the Soviet Union and Britain reach an agreement, the Soviet Union will declare to the world that it will not promote communism. Such an agreement may be established. But within the dividing line agreed upon by the two, as long as there are people and class struggle, their own movement will determine whether they go to the world of the Soviet Union or to the world of Britain and the United States (or to neither). No matter what kind of agreement the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States reach, after the national government of each country determines its political system, it will have no effect. Therefore, no matter how the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States reach an agreement to divide the world, it is often overturned by the national government movements of each country, thereby destroying the balance between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, and intensifying their opposition. Look at the current civil unrest in Greece that has shocked the world, and the opposition of the two Polish governments, which is the best example. In addition to these conflicts on the surface, there are also these conflicts in the dark, such as the opposition between the French de Gaulle government and the communist armed forces, and the internal opposition in Italy and Yugoslavia. Stalin has full confidence in the development of the national movements of each country, so he is very happy to conclude agreements with Britain and the United States. However, Stalin knows in his heart that this kind of agreement cannot continue forever. Naturally, Roosevelt and Churchill also know this. As long as Germany and Japan exist powerfully for one day, Roosevelt and Churchill must, even knowing that it is temporary, conclude agreements with the Soviet Union and spread all illusions to the people, believing that the world after World War II will achieve stability. This is the weakness of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Question: Wait! Didn't Roosevelt declare that the political system of each country in the post-war world will be determined by the people of each country?</p>

<p>Previously, the city's Bureau of Economic Affairs halted electricity supplies to general manufacturers as a result of the Luo Zhong Water and Electricity Company discontinuing service, bringing production to a standstill. Following discussions between the Bureau and relevant authorities, the decision was made to organize the registration of electricity consumption for all factories in the city, and staff were dispatched to conduct on-site investigations. After convening discussions with city merchants, industry associations were instructed to submit reports to the Bureau in advance for implementation. Since this began, it has been reported that over three thousand businesses have submitted electricity applications to date. The Bureau will consider order of allocation, It is our understanding that many factories have yet to submit reports, hence distribution will be delayed until this takes place. Electricity allocation will be implemented in the order that reports are submitted. The bureau hopes merchants will no longer delay submission.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Municipal Schools: Provisional Fee Collection Methods; Revised and Promulgated by the Municipal Bureau of Education <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Bureau of Education has recently revised the provisional fee collection methods for municipal primary and secondary schools as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Municipal primary and secondary schools must follow these regulations when collecting various fees from students.</p>
<p>(2) Tuition fees collected by municipal primary and secondary schools from students are specifically for improving the treatment of faculty and staff. The amount of fees collected will be determined by the Municipal Bureau of Education by district each semester, submitted to the Municipal Government, and then forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. (Attached is a table of the fee collection standards for municipal primary and secondary schools in each district for the second semester of the 33rd year [1944]). For first-class district secondary schools, the junior high school fee is 1800 yuan, and the senior high school fee is 2400 yuan. For second-class district secondary schools, the junior high school fee is 1300 yuan, and the senior high school fee is 1600 yuan. For first-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 1200 yuan, the middle grade fee is 1400 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 1600 yuan. For second-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 600 yuan, the middle grade fee is 700 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 800 yuan. For third-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 500 yuan, the middle grade fee is 600 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 700 yuan. For newly designated third-class district primary schools, the lower grade fee is 250 yuan, the middle grade fee is 300 yuan, and the upper grade fee is 350 yuan.</p>
<p>(Explanation) 1. First-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are the best. 2. Second-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are the next best. 3. Third-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are relatively poor. 4. Newly designated third-class districts refer to schools in each district where the economic conditions of student families are the worst. 5. All primary and secondary schools that were formerly established by the Public Works Department and the Municipal Council and are now municipal schools should uniformly collect fees according to the above standards from the second semester of the 33rd year [1944]. The school class will be determined by the Municipal Bureau of Education. However, the fee collection methods for foreign children's primary and secondary schools will be determined separately because all students are of foreign nationality. Half-day primary schools are of the nature of short-term primary schools, and they are allowed to collect half of the fee amount of the newly designated third-class primary schools. Night school tuition fees will also be determined separately by this bureau.</p>
<p>(3) Municipal primary and secondary schools with library facilities may collect library fees, specifically for purchasing essential reference books for students in the library. Those with sports facilities may collect sports fees, specifically for providing students with sports, hiking, travel, and hygiene supplies. (Attached is a table of the library and sports fee collection standards for municipal primary and secondary schools for the second semester of the 33rd year [1944]). The library fee for secondary schools is 100 yuan, and the sports fee is 50 yuan. The library fee for primary schools is 50 yuan, and the sports fee is 20 yuan.</p>
<p>(Explanation) 1. For the above library and sports fees, if student families have economic difficulties and it is inconvenient to collect them, each school may decide on its own to waive all fees, or waive fees for some students, or reduce the amount. 2. All fees collected above must be used by each school according to the specified purposes and must not be used for other purposes. 3. All schools that collect the above fees must prepare a budget of income and expenditure and submit it to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval at the beginning of each semester. At the end of the semester, they must submit a statement of income and expenditure for review along with the vouchers. 4. The fees for school supplies collected by each school from students are purely for agency purposes. The Municipal Bureau of Education will investigate the price situation each semester and separately determine the full amount and issue a notice for implementation. 5. If each school has student accommodation facilities and collects student accommodation fees, the full amount of fees collected each semester should be submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. 6. All miscellaneous fees, tutoring fees, and other names previously collected by each school are hereby canceled and must not be collected again. Violators will be treated as embezzlement and fraud. 7. If the principals of each school make false reports regarding various fees or collect fees without approval, they will be punished accordingly upon investigation. 8. The amount of tuition fees collected by each school should be handled in accordance with the standards stipulated by the bureau for each district. If there are special circumstances that require changes, they should be collected after being submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. 9. Municipal secondary schools should set up free places for no less than 15% and no more than 20% of the total number of students. Municipal primary schools should set up free places for no less than 20% of the total number of students. The maximum standard for free places in primary schools in first-class districts should not exceed 25% of the total number of students, in second-class districts should not exceed 30%, in third-class districts should not exceed 35%, and in newly designated third-class districts should not exceed 40%. However, this does not apply if there are special circumstances that have been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval. 10. Students of each school who have one of the following qualifications may be exempted from tuition fees: A. Children of current employees of municipal schools and social education institutions. B. The top three students in each grade. (Limited to one to three persons per grade. If there are fewer than thirty students in the grade, only one person is allowed.) C. Those whose families are indeed poor and unable to pay tuition fees, approved by the school and submitted to the bureau. D. If three or more siblings (limited to siblings with the same parents) are studying at the same school, one person may be exempted. E. Children of current low-level civil servants (below the rank of appointee) are fully exempt. The children of other civil servants may be granted half exemption after approval. F. Children of educational and cultural service personnel, and those with other special reasons, specially approved by the school and submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education.

<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has found that the self-defense firearm licenses issued by the former Second Police Bureau expired on December 31st of last year. It is now stipulated that from today until the end of this month, all those who hold licenses issued by the former Second Police Bureau must submit their firearms, ammunition, old licenses, and four 2.5-inch photos of themselves to the Firearms License Section of the Security Administration Division of the Administrative Office of the Bureau for registration. After inspection and investigation by the section, a steel stamp number will be branded, and a new license will be issued. Those who fail to do so within the time limit will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations. As for the firearm renewal procedures of the old First Bureau, the transfer procedures will be handled.

<p>The China Central Railway Company, in order to enhance wartime transportation capacity, complete air defense preparations, and due to the soaring costs of wages, prices, and coal, which have greatly inflated operating expenses, is permitted to increase passenger ticket fares by 14% and freight and long-distance bus fares by 15% from the 15th of this month. The increased passenger ticket prices and express train ticket prices from Shanghai to major stations are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Recently, prices have soared, and the lives of ordinary people have been severely threatened. In view of this, the municipal authorities, in addition to allocating large quantities of flour to various industries through the Flour Distribution Office, have also approved the Shanghai Special Municipality Pancake and Steamed Bun Guild's request to the Finance Bureau that steamed buns sold by all pancake stalls, whether filled or unfilled, be exempt from the consumption special tax, citing the Ministry of Finance's announcement that restaurants that only sell "one dish and one rice" to provide sustenance for ordinary people are exempt from the consumption special tax.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters, in order to strengthen civil air defense and cultivate air defense instructors, has established an air defense training center, selecting outstanding police and security personnel from various districts for rigorous training. The first class of 128 students has completed their training and passed the examination, qualifying as civil defense air raid instructors. Therefore, the headquarters has issued them certificates, filling in their names, ages, addresses, and the names of their respective Baojia, and attaching a photo of themselves in the upper left corner for identification. They have also been issued a white "Civil Defense Air Raid Instructor" armband, and a badge with a national emblem in blue on the front and the words "Air Defense" above and below, and the words "Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters Air Defense Training Graduates" in gold on the back, as a reward. It is stipulated that in the future, the Baojia in each district should assist these instructors in air defense situations and follow their guidance.</p>

<p>Looking around the schools in Shanghai, there are quite a few that carefully consider the actual situation, understand the burden on students' parents, and do their best to reduce tuition fees. However, some schools are strictly ordering students to pay tuition in full, and limiting them to pay tuition and miscellaneous fees within the year; otherwise, they will not issue grade reports, will not allow them to receive admission certificates, and will even prevent them from starting classes, using this as intimidation, causing students to cry and ask their parents, and parents are unable to cope due to their lives, so they have turned to the Shen and Xin newspapers to ask for student loans. The front of this office is quickly crowded with these lovely poor students, and the rest of the letters requesting assistance are also flying in like snowflakes, filling the desk. Besides expressing deep sympathy and comfort for this situation, the staff of this newspaper only feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient, and they cannot help. Looking at this year's grant budget, even if we can raise 30 million yuan, assisting the previous 4,500 or so old students, at an average of 10,000 yuan per person, will require more than 45 million yuan, which is still a considerable difference; moreover, so far we have only raised less than 20 million yuan (as of today, we have a total of 18,880,000 yuan). It seems that we are not sure about assisting new students, so we simply cannot help new students who come to ask for help in person or by letter! Your requests only increase our anxiety and guilt. When can we open "applications for new students"? Only enthusiastic people in society with strong power can answer. We are willing but unable, and we dare not harbor a psychology of perfunctoriness and deception.</p>

<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>(Continued from the Second Edition)</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. However, is America truly capable of doing so? I dare to assert that post-war America will absolutely not have room to adopt the current liberal diplomatic policy. The reason is simple: America, as it boasts itself, is the arsenal of the world's anti-Axis powers. America's military industry is supplying the vast amount of weapons consumed daily by anti-Axis nations worldwide. In particular, the development of the military industry has undeniably achieved considerable success recently. For example, taking the production index of aircraft in 1941 as 100, according to American propaganda, it was 344 in 1942, even more in 1943, and in 1944, it will exceed ten times that. Thus, America's military industry, having engaged in procurement on an unprecedented scale, cannot but proceed to consumption on an unprecedented scale as well. In other words, from whichever perspective one looks at it, American financial capitalism has already developed to the point where it must dominate the entire world. Based on this, two characteristics are clearly revealed in America's foreign policy. First, America can no longer maintain the liberal diplomacy it has always practiced in the Western Hemisphere. This is the reason for Hull's oppression of South American diplomacy, and the reason for the discord between Argentina and the United States. Second, America's foreign policy has recently ceased to refer solely to the Western Hemisphere; it has now reached the point where it cannot survive by relying solely on the Western Hemisphere market. The world market has become an indispensable necessity for American capitalist production. Roosevelt knows this very well, so during the war, he sent economic advisors to various parts of the world to obtain the necessary lifelines to maintain the world market.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the various markets predetermined by the United States after the war break away from American control, or if they completely establish independent economic policies, America's wartime investment will not only be wasted, but will also pose a crisis to the very survival of American capitalism. The freedom of each country to choose its political system cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>Question: The issue has gone too far afield. What is the relationship between the current situation in America and Song Ziwen's rise to power?</p>
<p>Answer: Roosevelt wants to firmly grasp the investment market for American post-war financial capital. Regarding this, the Lisbon dispatch on January 5th contained a passage saying: "The American industrial and commercial giants represented by the American Chamber of Commerce have been secretly working for a reciprocal trade treaty between the United States and China for the past year. But this anticipates that post-war China will experience a great new era of industrial development. Chamber President Kelley declared that Chongqing spokesmen have assured that Chongqing has revised its various regulations on foreign trade and investment under a liberal approach, and that free enterprise is protected by a modernized independent judiciary."</p>
<p>Song Ziwen's rise to power is the result of the new Chongqing path that Kelley spoke of. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek declared that party politics would also be implemented during the war, which is also a product of the same path. In a sense, this is a concession by Chongqing's nationalists to American financial capitalism.</p>
<p>Question: Chongqing's concessions to the United States will tend to intensify from now on, so ultimately Chongqing will become a colony of the United States. In order to counter this, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the CCP is becoming increasingly close, so wouldn't Chongqing be divided into a Sovietized China and an Americanized China?</p>
<p>Answer: In my presence, it is best to use less of the worthless propagandist's tone; I do not wish to hear such words. If the thing called "nation-state" is an economic range, the result will either become hidden or apparent due to the changes in the economic territory. Because China's capitalism does not have sufficient economic territory to prevent the invasion of American capitalism, and the economic territory that bitterly hates the CCP's workers and peasants has no reason to reject Soviet communist theory. For this reason, if pure economic struggle determines history, then Chongqing's territory can only become a battlefield between an Americanized China and a Sovietized China, and there is no other way to go. However, at present, no Chinese person is fighting for a Sovietized China or for an Americanized China. At the same time, in the peace zones, no pure Chinese person is fighting for a Japanized China. The purpose is all to fight for China's independence and autonomy. This is the characteristic of the "nation-state". Therefore, the term nation has again become a problem. Marxists believe that the nation "is formed by the elements of capitalist development, so the differences between nations will naturally disappear with the demise of capitalism" (Stalin's "On the National Question", I can only write it from memory because I do not have the book at hand). But in any case, one cannot but admit that "the elimination of national differences is first of all a long-term task, and can only be realized under the conditions of future social transformation" (Mitin's "Dictionary of Materialism").</p>
<p>The elements of national formation are the commonality of language, territory, economic life, and psychological habits. These elements are all acquired, but in a nation formed by the commonality of blood, such as the Japanese nation or the Chinese nation, the "blood" element is by no means acquired. Will this element also disappear with the demise of capitalism? Now, let us assume for the time being that other elements of national formation completely disappear, then will the group of Asians and the group of Caucasians completely eliminate any psychological antagonism and unite? Now, let us put the American example in the laboratory of national questions for analysis. Indeed, there is no longer any difference between German-Americans, British-Americans, and Russian-Americans among the American people. However, is there no "national" difference between Asian-Americans, Black-Americans, and White-Americans? Let's say it's not a national difference, but in terms of social treatment or social psychology, it cannot be said that there is absolutely no concept of racial discrimination. If China is incorporated into the world of the United States or the world of the Soviet Union, and such a concept of racial discrimination can be immediately guaranteed to be eliminated, I have no doubt. But I believe that in that case, the concept of racial discrimination will continue to be a social scorn. The difference in skin color and body structure between Asians and Caucasians is the material condition for this social scorn. How does Marxism understand this material condition? I believe that Japanese and Chinese people with such innate characteristics, if they do not first show strong power to the world, those Caucasians will not easily eliminate this scorn. I believe that the Japanese who have experienced the Meiji Restoration, and the Chinese who are currently carrying out the national liberation revolution, are all very clear about this point. Therefore, all Chinese people with a conscience do not want to use Japanese power to fight for independence and autonomy today, and do not want to rely on Soviet power to seek national liberation. They always want to rely on their own efforts, they want to complete the Chinese revolution by their own efforts, so that when China shows the face of a master to slaves, they should immediately resist, and not be servile and submissive. This is the spirit of national revolution. The Japanese must trust the Chinese national spirit a little more. The Japanese do not need to worry about the infiltration of American power into Chongqing, and even less need to worry about the political influence of Yan'an expanding due to the expansion of Soviet power. What is worrying is whether the Japanese fully understand this spirit of Chinese national revolution.</p>
<p>It is generally said that this year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. The so-called decisive battle is by no means simply a war with weapons in hand, nor is it simply being enslaved to increase production in the rear. If the Japanese do not understand this spirit of Chinese revolution this year, and do not correct the erroneous attitude of arrogance, then the decisive year will only be the Japanese's decisive year, and it will never be able to become the decisive year of the entire Asian nation. And the Greater East Asia War will not be easily won without the actual participation of the entire Asian people. Only when the Japanese fully realize this can they lay the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. (Translated by Jing)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Ciyou Association Fundraising Still Lacking Over 3 Million Yuan <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>In order to carry out the education and upbringing work for more than 300 refugee children, the Chinese Ciyou Association held a fundraising campaign a few days ago, which was well supported by the society and achieved good results. As of yesterday, a total of 6,721,496 yuan in donations had been received. The largest amount of donations was raised by Yang Pengnian, General Manager of Datong Enterprise Bank, at 981,070 yuan. His wife, Mrs. Yang, has a benevolent heart and has sponsored ten refugee children of the Association for two years. Two of the children are now studying in secondary school, and she often sends people to give them clothing and daily necessities to encourage them. The Yangs are a model for society in their enthusiasm for cultivating children from impoverished backgrounds. However, according to the current price situation, the Association needs to raise 10 million yuan to maintain expenses for half a year. There is still a shortfall of more than 3 million yuan in donations. In addition to the efforts of the Association's standing committee members Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Ding Boxiong to promote the campaign, it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously and participate in this grand event.</p>
