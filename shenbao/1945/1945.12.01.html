<h3 id="c1">中蘇談判將獲協議　國軍不久可空運長春 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶卅日電〕蔣委員長廿八日下午四時，召見東九省保安副司令長官梁華盛將軍，對梁氏年來在滇訓練各級幹部及技術人員成績，頗表慰勉，並對于東北新任務有詳細指示。梁氏定卅日離渝，飛漢赴潯，處理軍委會幹訓團團務後，即行北上。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶卅日電〕報載數日來中蘇談判結果，已對國軍進駐東北問題，獲得臨時決定，現正待莫斯科最後答覆。此項答覆如能滿意，則國軍可立即開入瀋陽。又據華北來訊，長春鐵路高級華員，已於數日來絡續由北平飛往長春。至接收東北工廠·礦塲，及其他各種工業之人員，則尚滯留關內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶卅日電〕此間報載，中蘇談判已見好轉，國軍即可由海空兩路順利開入東北，空軍人員現正在平津候機飛往東北，布置長春及瀋陽機塲。據聞一週內將作最後部署，屆時國軍空運即可開始。關於中蘇共同經營長春鐵路中國方面工作人員，廿七·八兩日分兩批自北平飛抵長春，國府準備先行接收行政機關，一俟中蘇談判成熟，即着手接收工廠。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶卅日電〕此間朝野各界，對塔斯社自長春發出之消息一則，深表滿意。該消息稱：馬林諾夫斯基已同意將蘇軍之自東北撒退，「暫緩一時」。並謂，蘇方之所以拒絕中國軍隊在大速登陸者，乃因大連「爲一商港，專運貨物不運軍隊」之故。塔斯社並稱華軍司令部擬空運軍隊至長春與瀋陽。預料中國地面人員，不久將抵達長春機塲，以待空運軍隊之飛機降落。此外該蘇聯通訊社並設明中國政府曾要朮蘇軍暫緩自東北撤退，因中國政府在原定蘇軍撤竣之日期十二月三日前，不能將軍隊開入東北，無從在該方面組織行政機稱。蘇軍究將留駐於東北若干時日，胥視中國政府官吏與馬林諾夫斯基在長春舉行談判後再行定奪。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國軍繼續北進中　東北保安司令部已遷錦州 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報天津三十日電〕杜聿明將軍率軍開入東北後，現仍繼續北進中。東九省保安長官部，二十六日晚已遷入錦州辦公。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶卅日電〕國軍在東北之進展，復告遲緩，正待中蘇談判之完成。國軍空運東北之詳細辦法正在計議中，惟此間一般印象，以爲中國願審愼從事，以免行動過速而引起國際糾紛。惟錦州以南之國軍，正繼續增强其地位，肅淸雜色部隊佔領之區域。聞共軍已破壞錦州與錦西間之橋樑，昨日接獲國軍佔領錦西之消息後，可知一部份橋樑當已修復。</p>
<h3 id="c3">黃河堤及粵漢路　修築工程即開始 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶卅日電〕蔣廷敝卅日下午招待新聞界，答記者問稱：（一）本署出售一部物資，展開善後救濟事業目的，在不增加國家通貨之發行，並藉以收回法幣，安定社會，收平抑物價之效，滬津等地糧價，因而下跌，實爲顯著之事實。（二）學校學生不能集體請求本署救濟，本署救濟對象爲義民，難民，現經本署由渝運送回籍者的四千人。（三）對黃河堤防，爲本署計劃中之量大工程，現已請專家着手檢查修築工程，即可開始，聯合國總署已允供給全部工程機器，工人作工以工代賬，惟工資支付之經費則由國庫撥發。粵漢路修築工程，本署亦將開始，聯合國總署技術人員一千五百名，將繼續來華工作。（四）台灣救濟工作，本署已請准聯合國總署，即以肥料兩船直接運往，明年初可到達，每船並裝醫藥數十噸，卡軍十餘輛，此項物資由台灣人民價購後，即以所得收購當地糖煤運來內地。（五）東北救濟工作，因無一海口可通，故無法開展。（六）運輸工具缺乏，爲本署當前最困難之問題，聯合國總署將有五萬五千噸新舊船隻供應，其中太古。怡和兩公司即有十五艘之多。同時美國將以菲律賓·硫球之登陸摩托船二百艘供我應用，每船可裝二千四百噸物資，目前已有八十艘運達；其餘尚有六百隻拖船，供我使用，每船可拖木船一百五十噸。（七）收復區因戰爭倒閉或被炸損之工廠，本署不負賠償之責，資本家亦不救濟，惟對失業工人將予以救濟。</p>
<h3 id="c4">杜魯門總統宣布　馬歇爾日內來華　將闡明在華執行之政策 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統今日在新聞會議席上宣稱：新任駐華特使馬歇爾將於三四日內赴華，執行新任務。總統稱對馬歇爾之訓令，現正在擬定中，將於日內局部予以發表，馬歇爾將闡明美國在華執行之政策。關於赫爾利於十一月二十七日辭職時對國務院之抨擊，杜總統拒絕表示意見。杜總統並宣佈，渠認爲聯合國機構可於九十日內討論一切擾亂國際局勢之特殊問題，因此渠與史達林及阿特里殊無繼續舉行會議之必要，杜總統鄭重言明美國將全力支持聯合國機構，執行此項新任務。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶三十日電〕共產黨之新華日報，今日著文歡迎馬歇爾，但希望此一美國新使節，立將美軍自中國撤退，送之返家，以度聖誕佳節。同時右翼之「世界日報」稱：「吾人歡迎馬歇爾，因深信渠將使美國堅强確定而最賢明之遠東政策維持不變，藉以確保國際問之均勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日專電〕若干人士暗示，杜魯門之經濟代表洛克，及海敦格特斯，不久即可返抵此間，將在馬歇爾啓程之前，有所會商。</p>
<h3 id="c5">交長兪飛鵬有辭職之說 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報重慶三十日電〕據靈通方面消息：交長兪飛鵬，因健康關係，傳已請求辭職。</p>
<h3 id="c6">美參院外委會　請赫爾利出席 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕參院外委會主席康納萊宣布，該會將於下星期三開會，要求赫爾利出席說明辭職背景，赫爾利稱，「余並未同意出席外委會秘密會議，國會如欲公開聽取報告，余無不樂於奉陪，並對華外交政策應公開聲明，余切望馬歇爾將軍能獲成就。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶卅日電〕共黨主辦之新華日報，今日請美國改變對華政策，謂赫爾利大使之辭職，實爲一絕好機會。華北現有美軍五萬人，該報認此爲赫爾利所加於美國人民之極大恥辱。</p>

<p>— 愼之</p>
<p>八年以前，南京撤退，政府機關雖然帶了一部份文物西去，但公私文物，遺留南京實在不少。尤其是八年以來，日僞在淪陷區各地搜集，使南京文物情形，十分混亂。其中原留在南京的東西，因爲各機關有目錄可查，有無損失，將來淸理時極易明瞭，至於從別處搜集來的，則恐須相當時間，才能使政府方面明瞭一般損失情形。</p>
<p>無論如何，截止目前爲止，任何人沒有辦法獲知封存的內容和損失情形，除非戰區文物淸理損失調查委會的工作能照預定計劃，在下月開始，或者可以有初步結果。在淸理工作過程中，也許可以發生若干間題，但我相信，必須在工作過程中，才能解決這些問題。</p>
<p>對於淸理工作，敎育部方面已經主持組織了上述的淸理委員會，由杭立武次長任主任委員，它的性質似乎是側重在準備要日方賠償一方面，因此它的任務便格外繁重。</p>
<p>日本投降以後，敎育部就派靑年考古學家金祖同先生到南京，主持封存文物的工作。他是繼冷欣副參謀長等而來的第二批人員之一，當時會同陸軍總部將各文物所在加封，以後又封上敎育部京滬區特派員辦事處的封條。因爲動作比較迅速，可信鮮有散失。直到現在爲止，一處一處仍舊封釘如昨，謝絕參觀。</p>
<p>但淸理委員會的辦事處就要在下月成立了，地址在朝天宮的故宮博物院。關於淸理辦法，已經訂出，現在正在朱家驊部長的反包裹。他把它帶到北平去了。只要等他南返之後，就可以核定施行。預計在下個月內，可以開始。將來朝天宮的辦事處是一個淸理中心。由委員會會同有關機關或私人，以及司法監察和地方機關，共同啓封。辦法中大致以「物歸原主」爲原則，至於沒有原主的，則彙案請政府再行核辦。</p>
<p>據我調查所得，過去汪精衛僞組織行政院曾組織「文物保管委員會」，主管這些文物，「委員會」下面分圖書，天文氣象，博物三個委員會，整理三部份文物。這個「委員會」先後由褚逆民誼，徐逆良，趙逆祖平任「主任委員」。</p>
<p>至於私人方面，最著名的，有在逆精衛和梁逆鴻志的古物書畫，汪逆的家產已經封了，梁逆則潛逃無踪，梁逆是福建梁章鉅的後人，桀家的收藏極豐富，即是著名的「歷代帝王圖」據有者，像這樣的文物，即梁的後人不做漢奸，也不宜私有，應由國家保存。但現在不惟梁逆鴻志還沒有下落，他的藏庋所在也還沒有搜尋到。此外最著名的要算陳逆羣了，陳在南京江西路設有私人圖書館，名「澤人文庫」。藏書七十餘萬册，恐怕是三處藏書中最大的一宗。（另外兩處：一在蘇州，一在上海。上海的也已由敎育部封存，蘇州的據說因被軍隊住用，還沒有接封。兩處的總數，也在幾十萬册之譜。）多爲宋元明版圖書。此外逆產，一時尚無法統計，希望當局格外注意。如給不肖之徒渾水摸魚，就是國家莫大損失。</p>
<p>現在南京方面的負責機關是敎育部特派員辦事處，以及戰區文物保管委員會，（將來這委員會的工作全部會移交給淸理委員會），力量所及，所有日偽的公家機關是都封釘了，封釘所在地：</p>
<p>（一）鷄鳴寺僞博物院（即中央研究院院址）；</p>
<p>（二）偽中央圖書館（即東方中學原址）；</p>
<p>（三）竹橋地質調查所；</p>
<p>（四）紫金山天文台；（見附圖）</p>
<p>（五）北極閣氣象台。</p>
<p>此外還有陳逆私人的「澤人圖書館」。（明日續完）</p>

<p>〔中央社歸綏廿九日電〕共產黨重行武裝已投降之日軍，對國軍進攻事，已得確證。緣於本月二十五日午後三時許，共產軍突以大砲向歸綏新城轟擊。城內連落二十餘彈，記者之寓所前，亦曾落一彈，幸未爆炸。當時守城軍民，均即對該砲之射擊及來源，頗表懷疑。比經連日詳確調查，方由一農民口中，述出眞相。據稱：二十五日午後，渠因事至歸綏新城東南五六里沙河岸，突遇八路軍開來的一二千人。另有汽車兩輛，載砲兩門。到達河岸後，即向城內射擊。嗣以國軍砲兵在城垣上還擊，第一彈射中八路軍靠東之一汽車，第二彈落於靠西另一汽車左近。八路軍見國軍砲火稠密，乃即仍循原路退去。當八路軍到達河岸時，將渠扣獲。因汽車上日本兵山田四郎，其在歸綏時，和渠相識，經其解說，始將我放釋。山田四郎原係駐綏遠之日本第十六師團十三聯隊砲兵，此次和山田四郎，同在汽車上之日兵，共的三十餘人。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏廿九日電〕（一）二十八日午後，包頭城郊有小接觸，共產軍有二次大規模攻城企圖。（二）由包頭西竄之共產軍一股，現沿後口子等地，向安北縣境騷擾搶糧搶壯丁。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶三十日電〕據陸軍總司令何應欽今日宣稱：日本著名將校，加入中國共產軍者已有數人，前關東軍參謀長酒井亦在其內。</p>
<h3 id="c12">社論　整肅官方！ <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>抗戰勝利，與民更始。人民所仰望於政府者至鉅，而政府人員在收復區的表現，未必盡能滿足人民的願望，寖假而竟有所謂「重慶人」與「上海人」的稱號，彷彿人民與政府間劃了一條鴻淸。其實官史未必全是敗類，人民亦非絕無奸宄，有怎樣的社會，乃有怎樣的政府，鴻溝原也不易劃的。不過，無論如何，這總是政府與民更始的時候。政府的第一件大事，莫過於整肅官方！</p>
<p>所謂整肅官方這一句話，內容所包，似很廣泛。有貪汚劣跡的官吏，應該厲行檢舉，從嚴懲處；其有憑藉權勢，欺凌人民者，亦應准人民隨時告發，絕不徇情。而淪陷期間媚敵欺民的漢奸，到此時擋身一變，仍想混迹官塲，魚肉小民的，更當繼以國法。這些都是整肅官方的極明顯的例子。這一方面的整，人民所希望於政府的是加强監察權的行施。中央有監察院，各省區有監察使，機構固早具備，權力似未昭著。今日監察機關所能糾彈　，　是次要或　　　　重要的人物。這當然不是說上級官更盡屬無過，而人　　於監察　的脆弱，　不免引起一種遺憾的感覺。所以在整肅官方上，我們希望監察機關不但能盡其糾彈之職責，並且還應該充分發揮國家付予它的權力。</p>
<p>是非不分，賞罰不明，使多少人心灰意懶。因爲賞罰不明，道德上就失去一種標準。爲惡的未必處罰，爲善的未見有賞。這雖不是鼓勵人去爲惡，而究不足以勗勉人去爲善。在這樣一種紀綱不振的情勢下，影響所及，政風日趨頹敗。這一種局勢的糾正，却不能全恃監察機關的力量。監察機關所能做的是旣成違法失職事實的消除，却不能管到行政上的賞罰嚴明。這就得靠首長督率下屬的有方；尤其要靠首長知人善任的選擇。今人常說行政效率的提高，倘祇從辦公時間的延長，五花八門表格的塡製去着眼，而未能使層層首長很賢明的執賞罰之樞紐，必然徒勞無功。須知放縱一個敗類者事小，而腐化一般政治者事大。殺一不　官吏，祇有一家哭。與其一路哭，何如一家哭？</p>
<p>要整　官方，尤須官吏本身嚴格檢點他們自身的行爲。今日官塲，祇求形式敷衍，不問實際效果，雖賢者亦有所不免，共結果流於自欺欺人。所謂「新官　主義」，在國民心理上有着極不良的印象。方面的　　官方，不　　於監察機關，亦不能全恃行政首長的措置賢明，而在如何樹起一種從政的新風氣。去華就實，該是這種新風氣的特色。國家經過長期戰事以後，元氣大傷，爲人民公僕的政府官吏，自不能再事因循，重陷虛浮奢華的惡習。八年抗戰，民力疲敝，公務人員都宜振奮有爲，趨向樸實，庶幾在政治上可以樹立起一種新風氣，挽紀綱於旣歷，這又是整肅官方上最積極的一點。</p>
<p>目今收復區的所謂「人心」問題，不是一個收復的問題，而是一個如何振奮的問題。效當建國之會，走向民主的大道，收復區的人心尤應該振奮起來。整肅官方即所以振奮人心之道，而發抓民衆的力量，我們更信爲整肅官方最重要的一種步驟。因此，我們盼望中央確實保障言論自由，使人民有發揮公正興論的力量，使不肖官吏憚於人民之淸議而歛跡。此外，我們更期望中央及各地方的民意機關應該普遍迅速成立起來，使人民對於庶政的革新，能够克盡監督的職責。現代民主政治的實質及其起因，就是「無代表不納稅」。面臨建國，向民主大道邁選的時會，中央依照歷次會議的決議，加速各級民意機關的建立，必可使官塲的如風悲習爲之一掃。我們站在輿論界的　塲，自亦決不願放棄應盡的職責，而將十　所視十手所指的，來帮助中央監督人民的公僕。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統今日在記者招待會上重宣稱：彼並不憂　蘇聯政策在製造另一次戰爭。某記者問，世界各國一部份人，現有兩種疑問，一即蘇聯不與各國合作，以確保世界和平，一即蘇聯政策終不免掀起戰端，總統以爲如何？杜魯門即以上述信念答之。又謂聯合國機　能依照其應走之路綫進行，則無須再舉行任何　巨頭會議。某記者問：聯合國管制德國政策及機構如須修正，則是否須要總統與史達林元帥及　特里　相舉行一次會議？　統答稱：不主張舉行特別會議，希望聯合國機構能於九十日之內將三頭會議所處理之各種問題，予以接辦。關於德國管制問題，四聯合國正在進行談判，以便修正波茨坦宣言，美國主張　正者任何決議須　　聯合國管制委員會全體一致同意一項規定。</p>
<p>明為將成為　和戰關頭</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿九日電〕數星期前記者嘗預言明年將爲此後和戰關頭，吾人是否能獲得眞正和平，狎人類將以原子能自殺，屆時富可分曉。在此期間，凡和平所繫之重要國際問題，吾人將一一遭遇，而三巨頭間之異見，尤屬危險，蓋三巨頭之和衷共濟，實爲和平與安全之保障也。如聯合國機構能加速運轉，以解決當前因難，則避免衝突之機會，當愈益增加。嘗詢諸籌備委員中人，對於此項觀察，僉表同意。苟吾人知事機之迫切而加速進行，則此和平機構可望於一個月後成立。於是世界主要問題，無論關於政治經濟者，均可提付討論。問題範圍極廣，凡危及國際和平者，均在其列，而尤以原子能管制問題爲首要。若循此原則進行，則以前認爲無關國際而僅爲一國內政之問題，亦將由此機構處理之。中國內戰即其一例，因其有危及世界和平之處也。此並非不尊重國家主權之謂，反之，純粹國內之事，絕對不許干涉，但各國亦可能將地方問題提付聯合國討論，如阿拉伯人與猶太人之爭執，即是嗣後遇有相類之問題，即可援例提出矣。</p>
<p>聯合國機構　會址問題</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日電〕聯合國組織籌委會之第八專門委員會，廿九日午後集會，繼續討論聯合國組織永久所在地地址問題，中心問題爲聯合國組織永久所在地應設於自主之國際區，抑設於位於一國領土內之國際區，有如丹吉爾之性質。英代表貝克主張予聯合國組織永久所在地之設立區域，以最大可能程度之國際性，渠建議設立聯合國特區，聯合國於該區內，可享不受干涉之自由，華盛頓之哥倫比亞即爲一例。貝克並支持執委會所提設立聯合國廣播電台，不受一切國家管制或監督之建議。比外長贊同第二制度，即贊成聯合國組織永久所在地設於位於一國領土內之國際區。荷蘭代表提請委會注意對渠昨日所提問題予以決定之需要，其昨日提出之問題，乃聯合國組織永久所在地應設於大國抑設於小國，渠認決定如對大國有利，即應採取若干預防措置，以防止聯合國組織設在地國家內强列民意干擾之危險。加拿大代表認爲兩種方案，均屬極端，故資同折衷制度，一半爲國際管理，一半賴設在國之協助。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕私立明德女子中小學，原設南市畫錦路畫錦坊二號，自建校舍，歷有年所。抗戰軍興，大半炸燬，僅留後部小學校舍八幢。國軍西撤後，暫假霞飛路六八八號現址復校，以迄於今。原有南市毁餘校舍，經修葺後，於三十二年六月起，由朱子卿者承租，租期一年，載明合同，期滿一再催遷，而一再延宕。</p>
<p>訂的續租</p>
<p>該校遂遷就事實，與朱子卿繼續簽訂合同，至三十四年五月底期滿交屋。詎屆期該朱子卿恐該校照約收回，竟向僞方密告該校校長梅頌先爲抗日份子，是項房屋遂由僞政府組織之渝產管理委員會接管。</p>
<p>意圖久佔</p>
<p>該朱子卿遂亦不再向該校繳納房租，而逕與該僞「渝產管理委員會」訂立租約，以爲久佔之計。茲値抗戰勝利，天日重光，爲謀復校計，特於十月間詳叙經過情形，呈請本市敎育局，勒令交還校舍，並嚴究奸逆朱子卿。經敎局派員查明，所呈各節，俱屬實情，特於上月一日以中字第五三號公函，送請警察局邑廟分局勒令交屋，並指令該校持同原函，逕與該分局洽商辦理。</p>

<p>昨日天氣驟寒，而中靑籃球房內，空氣殊見狂熱，東華與飛馬首先交鋒，東華因有必勝之心理，反見鬆懈異常，飛馬抱破釜沉舟之決心，精神奕奕，故飛隊一路佔先，直至十五比九後，東華不敢怠慢，韓龍海有投必中，於是由超出而領前，上半時車華終得以廿五對十七領前。下半時市華戰來仍不見如何緊凑，但飛馬以球藝較差，無能爲力，終結果東華以四七對廿九獲勝，韓龍海獨得二六分，允屬不易。</p>
<p>繼為　隊戰梁溪，後者昨有余郇子之助陣，全隊俱係老將，汕隊重用何立德紀南康等小將，開賽後，雙方均小心翼翼，梁溪機會甚多，惜皆射盬欠把握，汕隊則頗有聯絡，不慌不亂，陳淸江林維聰，屢有妙着，迨上半時完畢，汕隊一五分，梁溪八分。下半時梁溪以楊元龍調出余郇子，守的方面旣見鬆弛，攻的方面，未見得力，於是棋差一着，汕隊得以操縱局勢，陳淸江身手活躍，汕險終於擊退此强敵，比數三七對二〇。</p>

<p>劉鴻生昨對本報記者表示</p>
<p>〔本報專訪〕全國善後救濟總署上海分署長　鴻生，昨語本報記者：爲謀調濟本市食糧供應，本署將於短期內在滬發售巨量麵粉。該署已擬具計劃，以一部份自美　此之小麥，交本市各廠磨粉後，配發全市各麵粉零售商及糧食店，按指定價格。</p>
<p>公開發售</p>
<p>本市零售商約有三千餘家，首次配發每家約五十袋。劉氏又謂：本署主要目標在推進善後工作，關於麵粉配售，本署係採取簡易之商業方式，以調濟「供」與「求」，使囤積居奇者無法取得暴利。本署在</p>
<p>推行配售</p>
<p>時，處處以不使廠商及農民　暴力經濟打擊爲原則。因此，在平衡價格方面，本署將採用逐步推進之方式。同時，正當零售商亦將予以合法之利潤。如此，一方面得抑平糧食價格，同時本市經濟機構亦得日趨穩固。本市往昔米與麵粉價格之比例，爲一担米等於四袋麵粉，目前麵粉之價格因缺貨而被抬高，本署擬設法</p>
<p>抑平粉價</p>
<p>使恢復過去四對一之比例。據本市糧食商語記者。近日麵粉價格，因紛傳議後救濟總署有大量麵粉出售，故已瀉落甚鉅，據云若粉價回低，本市米價勢將隨之而降落。</p>

<p>軍及盟軍的將士們，在這次世界大戰時期中，或則轉戰於海上，或則搏鬥於空中，或則穿　　，越高山，踏泥淖，涉深水，面臨着兇蠻的敵人，和無情的砲火，出死入生，不顧一切，其辛苦與艱危，縱非身受目擊的人，也可以想像得到。我們全國的同　，無分男女老幼，無分南北東。，在這次大戰時期中，無時無　，不關懷　塲的鬥士們。這種　念的心情，藏在每個人的心坎裏，歷時愈久而愈深。今日上海全市的市民，遵照全國慰勞總會的規定，慰勞在滬國軍及盟軍，不過是把積在心坎裏的誠意，獻給於彊塲鬥士之前。</p>
<p>國軍及盟軍的將士們，或來自中國各地的戰區，或來自其他戰塲，大家在國際商業都市的上海會面，還是第一次。上海數百萬的市民，今日得與久歷彊塲的國軍及盟軍將士們會面，也可以說是第一次。國軍的將士們與盟軍的將士們，戰時在彊塲，生死與共；今日在上海。親密如家人，眞使上海全市市民，感覺着民族間惟有基於珍貴的友誼，才能促進眞誠的合作，才能奠定永久的和平。大家在萬分欣慰之餘，應有一個共同的信念；就是今後的世界，不容再有侵略的兇燄，不容再有獨裁的淫威，不容再有殘酷的戰爭，共同努力於世界和平的確保，走向人類文明自由幸福的康莊。尤其是這次大戰，發生於中國戰塲，結束於中國戰塲，我國同胞，創痛最深，犧牲最大，對於捍衛彊土的國軍，及在各戰塲與我並肩作戰的盟軍，不僅無時無刻的關懷，抑且出於至誠的崇敬。今日上海全市市民，就是本着這樣的情緒，和眞誠的崇敬，向國軍及盟軍將士，表示慰勞與感謝。</p>
<p>有滬的盟軍將士們，一部份因爲任務已告完成，即將歸國，不能久留在上海，敬代表全市市民致依依惜別之意。一部分盟軍將士，留滬時期，我們一切招待未週，敬代表全市市民，致無限抱歉之忱。</p>

<p>中美對壘—六塲大會</p>
<p>淸寒學子—感激而涕零</p>
<p>本報倡導讀者助學運動，歷時四年又半，辦理已達九屆，其間承社會各界人士，熱烈　贊，成效卓著。受助的淸寒學子，先後達二萬五千餘人。在抗戰期間，同胞顧沛流離，艱苦萬狀，這班可愛的淸寒學子，幸獲各界熱心人士的援助，得以絃歌不輟，繼續升學，直接爲搶救失學，間接為國家培植復興建設的人才，意義深長，功不可沒。今茲抗戰勝利，天日重光，凡百事業，亟待復興，助學運動，自當積極展開，本學期　將終了，同人秉歷年助學宗旨，對於第十屆助學金之籌募，理應未雨綢繆，以免臨渴掘井。所望各界賢達，賜予匡助，曷勝感幸！</p>
<p>今天我們爲助學運動，要報告讀者一個喜訊，這可說是抗戰勝利後海上球壇第一次偉大驚人的喜訊！事實是這樣的：同德醫學院院長顧毓琦博士，與本報當局會同發起中美籃球大比賽，旨在研　球藝，聯絡感情。售票所得，充本報及同德醫學院助學金，以救濟無數淸寒學子。關於邀請球隊及比賽日期及地點，正由華聯藥廠總經理張溎祥分頭進行。此刻可以先行奉告的，球隊將爲盟邦駐滬最强大的美憲兵隊，美空軍隊，美海軍隊，他們球藝的卓越，不在話下。我國將由稱雄海上華聯隊中靑隊出任對壘，這許多英雄好漢，當有一番精彩表演，貢獻於萬千球迷之前。至於比賽日期的在十天以後，地點則假座本市最寬敞的中華運動塲。（即回力球塲）總之這是空前盛大興奮而熱烈的義舉，願諸君拭目以待！</p>

<p>— 林漢達</p>
<p>（三）敎育信念的加强和敎學的改進　敎育原是一種勞苦而功不高的事業，敎育的效果一時很難見到，沒有信心的人老得不到成功的愉伏，來補償他的辛勞。要是各校釣敎員各自爲政，即使你眞的在奮鬥，也只是「孤軍」吧了。沒有道同志合的人互相研討，彼此鼓勵，很容易動搖信念，甚至會頹唐起來。到後來，竟把敎書看作比「失業」聊勝一籌吧了。對於事業旣然失了信仰利興趣，即使是優良的敎師，也會退化，何况本來並不怎末優良的敎師。孤獨乏味，沒有信心，鼓不起力求上進的勇氣，這是上海市一般小學敎師的苦悶，也就是小敎師資日趨低落的一個大原因。小敎聯進會是給頹唐的敎師「打氣的地方。會員由二一百人增加到一千二百餘人，足見敎師確實需要這種集會。一干多人聚在一起，心中有苦悶，彼此訴說，敎學上有心得，大家報告。這種精神上的休戚相關的熱忱，要是你不親自去觀察，你幾乎難以想像。許多人手拉着手，一齊向前進，即使在走着滿佈荆棘的道路，也覺得精神百倍，何况他們所走的是光明的大道？他們每星期日的集會，不單被動地聽些敎育演講，還有其他自動參加的節目。據我所知道的，他們還分區地組織國語班，英文班，歌詠班，話劇團，出版部，聯歡會等等。我曾經聽過他們好幾個學校聯合起來的大合唱，也見過各分區個別擔任的遊藝節目。在這種熱烈的集會中，明兒還找得到頹唐的影子。至於敎學的改進，我雖然不曾到各學校去調查，但是聽了會員所發表的意見，　了他們的筆記簿，也知道他們大有進步。他們從實際的經騐上所提出的好多敎上學的問題，雖然不能完全解決，至少，他們已經知道自我批評，已經在開發新的敎學法了。</p>
<p>最近聯進會已經議決，要和校方加緊聯絡，使這個進修會不僅限於敎師，還要擴充到校長，請校長也去參加，還要舉行校長座談會，校長演講等等，務使校長與敎師之間傳統的階級膈膜完全打破，做到上下一心，為敎育而服務的地步。這不但是校長和敎師的幸福，也是小學生和國家的幸福呀。</p>
<p>我當初很驚奇小敎聯遝會會有這末可愛的精神，後來見了他們的會刋「敎師生活」，才知道上海的敎育名流和熟心敎育的人士當中有三十多人都是該會的顧問。如：國民敎育處處長朱君惕，中等敎育處處長陳靑士，社會敎育處處長兪慶棠，以及陳鶴琴·孫貴定·張耀翔·僅統先·黃寄萍等幾位先生，都在負責指導他們。可見得只要敎育先進大家肯出來領導，上海市師資的訓練是可以提高的。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c63">看報讀書的興趣 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>中國抗戰八年來，人民智識程度的提高，很可以從自由區的新聞和出版事業的發達看出來。</p>
<p>單講重慶一個地方，每天往常出版的報紙，就有十種之多。其中銷數較好的可以實銷到六萬份以上。這個數目已經超過了戰前一班大城市報紙的銷數了。雜誌方面，重慶一地至少有百餘種。其中銷數較多的，與戰前全國各地雜誌新聞紙郵寄暢通時比較起來，相差無幾。試想戰前沿海的大城市和文化中心如北平·天津·上海·漢口·廣州等地，以及全國省份的大半，都已淪陷敵手，能够銷行書刋的自由區所包括的地帶，不及戰前的四分之一，祇有文化水準比較落後的幾個省份，而在抗戰期間那種物質條件艱窘，印刷運輸郵寄困難，書價昂貴的情形下，一本用土報紙所印出來的刋物，其銷行數量仍能與戰前不相上下，這不能不說是一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>至於讀書的風氣，在內地也十分流行。書店雜誌公司裏面，整天川流着買書和看書的人。尤其是在傍晚和晚上，更是擁擠不堪。</p>
<p>抗戰八年，增加了中國民衆看報，看雜誌，利讀書的熱誠和興趣。這也是一個値得欣慰的現象。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3 id="c64">齊亞諾日記及其人他 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 余範</p>
<p>一九四四年一月，義大利前外相齊亞諾被墨索里尼以叛述罪處決於凡洛那。在死刑前數小時，他在獄中把秘藏的日記五厚册珍重交付給他的愛妻安達（墨索里尼的女兒）。安達化裝成一個貧婦，在襤褸的衣服下夾帶了這些日記簿，偸偸地逃到瑞士。</p>
<p>安達曾幾次寫信懇求羅紫里尼，無論如何要保全齊亞諾的性命，但是墨索里尼恨之切骨，不肯徇情，於是衆叛親離，安達決心把日記公諸於世。齊亞諾日記始自一九三九年，記載着法西斯的內幕極詳，是一部極有價値的暴露書，公開之後，全世界爲之轟動。</p>
<p>據說這部日記安達已以七萬五千美金的代價，售與芝加哥日報、，全書尚未有出版的消息，但零紙斷片已爲全世界報紙雜誌所競載着。</p>
<p>『齊亞諾日記』引起了全世界出版商的競購，自從納粹傾覆之後，出版商又搶先到德國去搜覔秘笈，其情况眞有些如火如荼，於是一些納粹首領的片紙隻字，都成爲奇貨可居。最妙的莫過於一班失意政客，落魄軍官，現在都是開口版稅，閉口稿費，咖啡店甚至於監獄中都在接洽着這一種生意經。</p>
<p>『戈林筆記』不過是一些零亂而不述續的斷句，發現了之後，居然也像金鑛一樣吸引了許多人，現在是讓法國一個情報部人員捷足先得了去。</p>
<p>希特勒情婦勃朗的日記，又是一票奇貨。最近美國特務機關從勃朗的珍實箱中發現出來。其中的內容現在已有部份發表。是一九三五年二月至五月間早期的戀史，勃朗自認她已成爲『德國以及全世界最偉大的主婦。』</p>
<p>據日記所述，希特勒在用情的時候已往往是暴虐不近人情的。他往往不肯履行已給的了的諾言，但有時候又沒來由的送給她一封禮物，沒有一個字的說明，希特勒看見她出去跳舞，總要發怒，但發怒的結果也不過是幾個星期避開了不理她而已。</p>
<p>在二十三歲生日那天，她所最希望的東西是一隻獵狗。但是希特勒根本不記起她的生日。『他今天來得正好——但是沒有狗。他甚至一句也不問起我爲什麼緣故新買了這許多珠寶——一個項圈，耳環，指環（這些共費五鎊），它們都十分精美，我想他一定也歡喜它門，倘若不歡喜，他應當另外給我買來更好的。』</p>
<p>由日記所示，勒期是個貪得而且奇妒的婦人。關於希特勒尚未有所啓示，但這些日記無疑能帮功我人對這位混世魔王更深切的瞭解。齊亞諾日記，戈林筆記，以至於勃朗日記，這一類文獻不僅對於好奇者是一種癖嗜的滿足，它們更重要的意義就是供給心理學家一些珍貴的研究資料，也許戰後的世界將蒙其益，而獲更多的和平的保障。</p>
<p>編者按：『齊亞諾日記』已由重慶國民公報編輯主任陳封雄譯出，在該報副刋連載，並已排印在渝出單行本，不久可能在北平及上海出版。『戈淋筆託』業由重慶掃蕩報副刋絲者劉同緯譯出一部，在掃蕩副刋連載。</p>

<p>一九四二年夏天，有一羣蘇聯兵被德軍所俘。其中有一位衰弱消擭的戰俘，名呌雅各。朱額希維里，是紅軍統帥史丹林的兒子。他在走過德國軍官面前的時候，違反軍中的向例，不向德國電官敬禮。德國軍官就嚴厲　問他爲　麽不行禮。</p>
<p>他回答道：『我祇不過被俘，並未被征服』。</p>

<p>他說了：『我自己也不知預備把你怎麽樣。我當然是應該將你交給警察的。你是一個俘虜—不，不要告訴我任何事情。』他看見那人好像要說話的樣子，就舉起了他的手。『除非我問你，連你的名字都不要告訴我。』</p>
<p>他們對看一會兒，這年經人就閉上了眼睛，轉身向壁。</p>
<p>『好吧，』他低語道，他的嘴閉成了痛苦的一條綫。</p>
<p>花子在門外等着貞雄。他立刻看出她是遇到了什麽麻煩了。</p>
<p>她說：『貞雄，弓子剛才跟我說，如果我們再將這人藏在這裏的話，使人們就不能再留在這裏了。她告訴我，他們在說我們住在美國太久了，因此忘記了先爲自己的國家設想。他們想我們是歡喜美國人的。』</p>
<p>貞雄嗄聲道：『這是不對的，美國人是我們的仇敵。可是我已受過訓練，在我有能力做得到的時候，我不能眼看着一個人死去。』</p>
<p>花子焦急地說：『傭人們却不能懂得這個。』</p>
<p>他也同意道：『對的。』</p>
<p>兩個人好像都不能再講什麽了，家裏也還是照舊過下雲。傭人們一天比一天機警。他們還是像從前一樣小心的鞠躬，可是他們注視着他們的主人時的眼睛却是冷冰冰的。</p>
<p>那個老園丁有一天說：『我們的主人應該怎樣做這是很淸楚的事。』他一生都在管着花，對於蘇苔猶其是個專家。他替貞雄的父親造了個日本最好的蘇苔園，時時掃淸那鮮明的綠色的地毯，沒有一片樹葉或一枝枯了的針葉能損害了它的柔潤。他現在正搯住了一枝灌木上的一個甲虫，說：『我的老主人的兒子知道得很淸楚，他該怎麼做。這人旣已差不多要死了，為什麽不讓他繼續流血呢？』</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sino-Soviet Negotiations to Reach Agreement; National Army to Soon be Airlifted to Changchun <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek met with Lieutenant General Liang Huasheng, Deputy Commander of the Security of the Nine Northeastern Provinces, at 4 PM on the 28th. He expressed his appreciation for Liang's achievements in training cadres and technical personnel of all levels in Yunnan Province over the years, and gave detailed instructions regarding his new mission in the Northeast. Liang is scheduled to leave Chongqing on the 30th and fly to Hankou via Xunyang to handle the affairs of the Military Affairs Commission Training Group before heading north.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 30th] Reports indicate that the Sino-Soviet negotiations have resulted in a temporary decision on the issue of the National Army's entry into the Northeast, and a final response from Moscow is currently awaited. If this response is satisfactory, the National Army can immediately enter Shenyang. Furthermore, according to news from North China, senior Chinese railway officials in Changchun have been flying from Beiping to Changchun for several days. As for personnel to take over factories, mines, and other industries in the Northeast, they are still staying inside the customs.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] Local newspapers report that the Sino-Soviet negotiations have seen improvement, and the National Army can smoothly enter the Northeast by both sea and air. Air Force personnel are currently waiting for planes in Beiping and Tianjin to fly to the Northeast and set up airfields in Changchun and Shenyang. It is rumored that final deployments will be made within a week, at which point the National Army's airlift can begin. Regarding the Chinese personnel working for the Sino-Soviet joint management of the Changchun Railway, they arrived in Changchun in two batches from Beiping on the 27th and 28th. The National Government is preparing to take over administrative organs first, and will begin taking over factories once the Sino-Soviet negotiations reach fruition.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] All sectors of the public in this area are deeply satisfied with a TASS news item originating from Changchun. The news stated that Malinovsky had agreed to a "temporary postponement" of the Soviet Army's withdrawal from the Northeast. It also stated that the reason the Soviet side refused Chinese troops to land at Dalian was because Dalian "is a commercial port, specializing in transporting goods, not troops." TASS also stated that the Chinese military headquarters planned to airlift troops to Changchun and Shenyang. It is expected that Chinese ground personnel will soon arrive at Changchun Airport to await the landing of aircraft carrying the airlifted troops. In addition, the Soviet news agency clarified that the Chinese government had requested the Soviet Army to postpone its withdrawal from the Northeast because the Chinese government could not deploy troops to the Northeast before the original withdrawal date of December 3rd, and therefore could not organize administrative organs in that area. How long the Soviet Army will remain stationed in the Northeast depends on further negotiations between Chinese government officials and Malinovsky in Changchun.</p>
<h3 id="e2">National Army Continues Northward Advance; Northeast Security Headquarters Moved to Jinzhou <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 30th] After General Du Yuming led his troops into the Northeast, he is still continuing his northward advance. The Northeast Nine Provinces Security Headquarters moved into Jinzhou to conduct official business on the evening of the 26th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] The National Army's progress in the Northeast has once again slowed, pending the completion of the Sino-Soviet negotiations. Detailed plans for the National Army's airlift to the Northeast are currently under consideration. However, the general impression here is that China wishes to proceed cautiously to avoid international disputes arising from overzealous actions. However, the National Army south of Jinzhou is continuing to strengthen its position, clearing areas occupied by miscellaneous troops. It is heard that the Communist Army has destroyed the bridges between Jinzhou and Jinxi. After receiving news yesterday that the National Army had occupied Jinxi, it can be seen that some of the bridges must have been repaired.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yellow River Embankment and Guangdong-Hankou Railway; Repair Projects to Commence Soon <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chiang Tingfu received the press on the afternoon of the 30th and, in response to reporters' questions, stated: (1) The purpose of this office selling some materials to launch post-war relief efforts is to avoid increasing the issuance of national currency and to stabilize society and curb prices by withdrawing legal tender. The drop in grain prices in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places is a significant fact. (2) School students cannot collectively request relief from this office. The targets of this office's relief efforts are righteous people and refugees. 4,000 people have been transported back to their hometowns by this office from Chongqing. (3) Repairing the Yellow River embankment is a major project planned by this office. Experts have been engaged to start checking the repairs, and the project will begin soon. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has agreed to supply all the machinery for the project. Workers will be paid with work-for-food, but the funds for wage payments will be allocated by the national treasury. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway repair project will also be started by this office. 1,500 UNRRA technical personnel will continue to come to China to work. (4) Regarding relief efforts in Taiwan, this office has obtained UNRRA's approval to directly ship two shiploads of fertilizer. They can arrive early next year. Each ship will also be loaded with dozens of tons of medicine and more than a dozen card vehicles. After these materials are purchased at market price by the people of Taiwan, the proceeds will be used to purchase local sugar and coal to be transported to the mainland. (5) Relief work in the Northeast cannot be started because there is no seaport available. (6) The lack of transportation is the most difficult problem currently facing this office. UNRRA will supply 55,000 tons of new and old ships, including 15 from the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies. At the same time, the United States will provide 200 landing motorboats from the Philippines and Ryukyu Islands for our use. Each boat can load 2,400 tons of materials. Currently, 80 boats have arrived. There are also 600 tugboats for our use, each of which can tow wooden boats of 150 tons. (7) This office is not responsible for compensating factories in the recovered areas that have closed down due to war or have been bombed. Capitalists will not be rescued, but relief will be provided to unemployed workers.</p>
<h3 id="e4">President Truman Announces; Marshall to Come to China Within Days; Will Clarify Policy to be Implemented in China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] President Truman announced at a press conference today that the new special envoy to China, Marshall, will travel to China in three or four days to carry out his new mission. The President said that the instructions for Marshall are currently being drafted and will be partially released within days. Marshall will clarify the policy that the United States will implement in China. Regarding Hurley's criticism of the State Department when he resigned on November 27, President Truman declined to comment. President Truman also announced that he believes that the United Nations organization can discuss all special problems that disrupt the international situation within 90 days, therefore he and Stalin and Attlee do not need to continue to hold meetings. President Truman solemnly stated that the United States will fully support the United Nations organization in carrying out this new mission.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 30th] The Communist Party's Xinhua Daily wrote an article today welcoming Marshall, but hopes that this new American envoy will immediately withdraw American troops from China and send them home to spend the Christmas holidays. At the same time, the right-wing "World Daily" said: "We welcome Marshall because we firmly believe that he will keep America's strong, definite, and most wise Far East policy unchanged, so as to ensure the balance of power in the international community."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Some people suggest that Truman's economic representatives, Lock and Haytungutters, will soon return here and will consult with each other before Marshall sets off.</p>

<p>[China-England News Agency, New York, 30th] International Electric Company Manager White said that modern factories with high-speed production will produce electrical equipment, household appliances, and other electrical equipment worth $34 million annually to meet China's needs. In August of this year, the National Resources Commission of our country signed a contract with the company. The latter will be responsible for supplying engineers and technical personnel, designing and building complete factories and companies for China, and providing China with all knowledge related to electrical factories in the position of consulting engineers, but there is no financial relationship.</p>
<p>300 Students to Study in the United States</p>
<p>The company will also be responsible for training 300 Chinese students in New York for more than five years, teaching them various knowledge of electrical manufacturing. The selection of this group of students will be based on their educational level, specialized knowledge, and work experience before studying in the United States. White said that the implementation of this overall plan requires capital of $25 million and will be completed in 12 to 18 months. All factory management personnel will be Chinese. At the same time, other American industrial companies are also actively planning to assist China in building industries or to cooperate with China independently and permanently.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Cultural Relics of Nanjing; Part 1 <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhi</p>
<p>Eight years ago, during the retreat from Nanjing, government agencies took some cultural relics west, but many public and private cultural relics were left behind in Nanjing. In particular, over the past eight years, the Japanese puppets have collected artifacts from all over the occupied areas, making the situation of Nanjing's cultural relics very chaotic. Among them, the things originally left in Nanjing can be easily understood in the future clearance because the various institutions have a catalog to check for any losses. As for those collected from other places, it may take considerable time for the government to understand the general loss situation.</p>
<p>In any case, to date, no one has been able to know the contents and losses of the sealed items, unless the work of the Wartime Cultural Relics Clearing Loss Investigation Committee can start as planned next month, or there may be preliminary results. In the process of cleaning up, some problems may occur, but I believe that these problems can only be solved in the process of work.</p>
<p>Regarding the cleaning up work, the Ministry of Education has already organized the above-mentioned cleaning up committee, with Deputy Minister Hang Liwu as the director. Its nature seems to focus on the aspect of preparing for Japanese compensation, so its task is particularly heavy.</p>
<p>After the surrender of Japan, the Ministry of Education sent the young archaeologist Mr. Jin Zutong to Nanjing to preside over the sealing of cultural relics. He was one of the second batch of personnel to come after Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Xin, etc. At that time, he, together with the Army Headquarters, sealed up the locations of the cultural relics, and then sealed them with the seals of the Ministry of Education's Nanjing-Shanghai District Special Commissioner's Office. Because the action was relatively quick, it is believed that few items were lost. Until now, each place is still sealed as before, and visits are declined.</p>
<p>But the cleaning up committee's office will be established next month, at the Palace Museum in Chaotian Palace. Regarding the cleaning up methods, they have been formulated and are now in Minister Zhu Jia-hua's bag. He took it to Peiping. As long as he returns south, it can be approved and implemented. It is expected that it can be started within the next month. The office in Chaotian Palace will be a cleaning up center in the future. The committee will jointly unseal the items with relevant agencies or private individuals, as well as judicial supervision and local agencies. The general principle in the method is "returning items to their original owners." As for those with no original owner, the cases will be summarized and submitted to the government for further review.</p>
<p>According to my investigation, the Wang Jingwei puppet regime's Executive Yuan once organized a "Cultural Relics Preservation Committee" to manage these cultural relics. The "Committee" was divided into three committees: books, astronomy and meteorology, and museums, to organize the three parts of cultural relics. This "Committee" was successively headed by Chu Ni Minyi, Xu Ni Liang, and Zhao Ni Zuping as "Directors."</p>
<p>As for private individuals, the most famous are the antiques, calligraphy, and paintings of Ni Jingwei and Liang Ni Hongzhi. Ni Wang's family property has been sealed. Liang Ni has fled without a trace. Liang Ni is a descendant of Liang Zhangju of Fujian. His family's collection is extremely rich, and he is the owner of the famous "Portraits of Emperors of All Dynasties." Cultural relics like these, even if Liang's descendants did not become traitors, should not be privately owned, and should be preserved by the state. But now, not only is Liang Ni Hongzhi still missing, but the location of his collection has not been found. In addition, the most famous is Chen Ni Qun. Chen has a private library on Jiangxi Road in Nanjing, called the "Zeren Library." It has more than 700,000 volumes of books, which is probably the largest collection of the three collections. (The other two are in Suzhou and Shanghai. The one in Shanghai has also been sealed by the Ministry of Education, and the one in Suzhou is said to be occupied by the army and has not yet been sealed. The total number of both places is also in the hundreds of thousands of volumes.) Most of them are books from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. In addition, the traitor's assets cannot be statistically calculated for a while. I hope the authorities will pay special attention. If unscrupulous people are allowed to fish in troubled waters, it will be a great loss to the country.</p>
<p>The responsible agencies in Nanjing are the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Education and the Wartime Cultural Relics Preservation Committee (the work of this committee will be transferred to the Cleaning up Committee in the future). To the best of their ability, all the public agencies of the Japanese puppets have been sealed. The sealed locations:</p>
<p>(1) The Puppet Museum in Jiming Temple (i.e., the former site of the Academia Sinica);</p>
<p>(2) The Puppet Central Library (i.e., the former site of Dongfang Middle School);</p>
<p>(3) The Zhugiao Geological Survey Institute;</p>
<p>(4) The Zijin Mountain Observatory; (See attached photo)</p>
<p>(5) The Beijige Meteorological Observatory.</p>
<p>In addition, there is Chen Ni's private "Zeren Library." (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Communist Army Conscripts Japanese Artillery; Forces Them to Bomb Guisui City; Small Skirmishes Continue in the Suburbs of Baotou <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 29th] It has been confirmed that the Communist Party has re-armed surrendered Japanese troops and attacked the National Army. At around 3 PM on the 25th of this month, the Communist Army suddenly bombarded Guisui's new city with artillery. More than 20 shells landed in the city. A shell also landed in front of the reporter's residence, but fortunately it did not explode. At that time, the soldiers and civilians defending the city were skeptical of the artillery fire and its source. After days of careful investigation, a farmer revealed the truth. According to him, at noon on the 25th, he went to the bank of the Shahe River, five or six li southeast of Guisui New City, for business and suddenly encountered 1,000 to 2,000 Eighth Route Army soldiers. There were also two cars carrying two cannons. After arriving at the river bank, they fired at the city. Later, the National Army artillery retaliated on the city walls. The first shell hit one of the Eighth Route Army's cars on the east side, and the second shell landed near another car on the west side. Seeing the dense National Army artillery fire, the Eighth Route Army retreated along the original route. When the Eighth Route Army arrived at the river bank, they detained him. Because the Japanese soldier Yamada Shiro in the car knew him when he was in Guisui, he was released after his explanation. Yamada Shiro was originally an artilleryman of the 13th Regiment of the Japanese 16th Division stationed in Suiyuan. There were more than 30 Japanese soldiers, including Yamada Shiro, in the car this time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 29th] (1) There was a small skirmish in the suburbs of Baotou on the afternoon of the 28th. The Communist Army made two large-scale attempts to attack the city. (2) A contingent of the Communist Army that fled west from Baotou is now harassing and looting grain and conscripting men in Anbei County and other places along the Houkouzi area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 30th] According to Army Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin today, several well-known Japanese generals have joined the Chinese Communist Army, including Sakai, the former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Editorial: Rectifying the Officialdom! <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The victory of the War of Resistance marks a new beginning with the people. The people's expectations of the government are enormous, but the performance of government personnel in the recovered areas may not fully satisfy the people's wishes. Gradually, the terms "Chongqing people" and "Shanghai people" have emerged, as if a chasm has been drawn between the people and the government. In reality, officials are not all corrupt, and the people are not without their traitors. A society gets the government it deserves, and the chasm is not easily drawn. However, in any case, this is a time for the government to start anew with the people. The government's first major task is nothing less than rectifying the officialdom!</p>
<p>The so-called "rectifying the officialdom" is a phrase with broad implications. Corrupt officials with scandalous records should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. Those who abuse their power to oppress the people should be subject to accusations by the people at any time, without any favoritism. Those who were traitors during the occupation, flattering the enemy and deceiving the people, and who now shamelessly transform themselves, still wanting to meddle in officialdom and prey on the common people, should be prosecuted according to national law. These are all very obvious examples of rectifying the officialdom. In this regard, what the people hope from the government is to strengthen the exercise of supervisory power. The central government has the Control Yuan, and each province and region has a supervisory commissioner. The institutions have long been established, but their powers do not seem clear enough. Today, the supervisory organs can only impeach minor or unimportant figures. This is not to say that all higher-ranking officials are without fault, but the fragility of the supervisory system inevitably evokes a sense of regret. Therefore, in rectifying the officialdom, we hope that the supervisory organs will not only fulfill their duty of impeachment, but also fully exercise the powers granted to them by the state.</p>
<p>The inability to distinguish right from wrong and the lack of clear rewards and punishments have disheartened many. Because rewards and punishments are unclear, morality loses a standard. Evil deeds may not be punished, and good deeds may not be rewarded. While this may not encourage people to do evil, it is certainly not enough to encourage people to do good. Under such circumstances of declining discipline, the political atmosphere is becoming increasingly corrupt. The correction of this situation cannot rely solely on the power of the supervisory organs. The supervisory organs can only eliminate established facts of illegality and dereliction of duty, but they cannot manage the clarity of rewards and punishments in administration. This depends on the effective leadership of superiors over their subordinates, and especially on the wise selection of talent by superiors. Today, people often say that improving administrative efficiency by simply extending office hours and filling out all kinds of forms is futile if superiors at all levels fail to skillfully wield the power of reward and punishment. It must be understood that letting go of one bad element is a small matter, while corrupting general politics is a big matter. Killing one corrupt official only causes one family to cry. Instead of everyone crying along the way, why not just one family?</p>
<p>To rectify the officialdom, officials themselves must strictly examine their own behavior. Today's officialdom only seeks perfunctory formalities, regardless of actual results. Even the virtuous are not exempt from this, and the result is self-deception. The so-called "new official doctrine" has a very negative impression on the national psyche. This aspect of rectifying the officialdom does not rely solely on the supervisory organs, nor can it rely entirely on the wise measures of administrative leaders, but on how to establish a new style of political conduct. Getting rid of the superficial and embracing the substantial should be the hallmark of this new style. After a long war, the country is severely weakened. As public servants of the people, government officials cannot continue to be complacent and relapse into the bad habits of vanity and extravagance. After eight years of war, the people are exhausted. Civil servants should all be motivated and strive to be practical. Only in this way can a new style be established in politics and discipline restored. This is the most active point in rectifying the officialdom.</p>
<p>The so-called "popular sentiment" issue in the recovered areas is not a matter of recovery, but a matter of how to revitalize. At this time of national construction and the march towards democracy, the popular sentiment in the recovered areas should be revitalized. Rectifying the officialdom is the way to revitalize popular sentiment and unleash the power of the masses. We believe this is the most important step in rectifying the officialdom. Therefore, we hope that the central government will truly guarantee freedom of speech, so that the people have the power to express just opinions, and that unscrupulous officials will fear the public's clear judgment and restrain themselves. In addition, we hope that the central and local representative bodies should be established quickly and universally, so that the people can fulfill their supervisory duties in the reform of public administration. The essence and origin of modern democratic politics is "no taxation without representation." Faced with the opportunity of national construction and the march towards democracy, the central government, in accordance with the resolutions of previous meetings, should accelerate the establishment of representative bodies at all levels. This will certainly sweep away the bad habits of officialdom. Standing in the realm of public opinion, we will certainly not give up our due responsibilities, and we will use the eyes and hands of the public to help the central government supervise the people's public servants.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Luohe, 30th] (1) Eight or nine hundred communist troops violently attacked Tanghe North's Sheqi town around 3 PM on the 27th, but were repelled by the National Army.

<p>Obey Central Government Orders, Abandon Armed Struggle</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The Chinese Institute of Engineers, Labor Association, National Medical Association Joint Federation, National Chinese Medicine Association Joint Federation, Borderland Society, National Sports Advancement Association, United Nations China Comrades Association, and National Automobile Industry Association, and other eight organizations, jointly initiated the convening of national people's organizations. At 2 PM on the 30th, a tea party on state affairs was held at the National Diplomacy Association. More than three hundred representatives from over one hundred and sixty units of national organizations, including the New China Construction Association and the Catholic Cultural Association, temporarily elected Pan Yangshan, Kong Geng, Zhou Maozhi, Rao Shifen, Tang Jianyu, Zhuang Jing, Zheng Manqing, Zhu Qiluo, Dong Shouyi, Lu Ruobing, and He Baoren as the presidium, with Pan Yangshan as the chairman of the presidium. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, all present demanded that the government recognize the need to quell the internal strife and finally unanimously resolved to organize a People's Organizations Liaison Association, with the elected members of the presidium as preparatory personnel, and passed a declaration on the current situation, stating roughly: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, thanks to the firm and wise leadership of the Supreme Commander and the national effort to fight to the death, final victory was achieved. Fortunately, our rivers and mountains can be rebuilt, and unification is in sight. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party has other plans, brazenly causing chaos, treating the people as gullible and disregarding discipline. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party promised to accept central command, but for the past eight years, it has remained separate, even colluding with the enemy and puppets to attack the National Army, only caring about expanding its strength and cultivating its followers. Its transgressions and illegal activities are too numerous to mention. After the enemy surrendered, it dispatched generals and troops to seize cities and territories, block the National Army, obstruct the surrender, and even destroy all national transportation and resources. The central government, mindful of the suffering of the recovered areas, explicitly ordered a one-year suspension of conscription and grain requisition, while the so-called "liberated areas" have been levying exorbitant taxes and extorting supplies for up to several years, forcibly recruiting soldiers, burning houses, and using all kinds of vicious methods to harm our people. The enemy and traitors dared not do what they did, and they did not show the slightest concern. The people are displaced and suffering, and those who did not die under the enemy's iron hooves will die from the Communist Party's poison. All that our people seek today is a swift recovery, to provide shelter to refugees, to heal the wounded and save the dying, to reunite families, and to prevent the land from becoming barren again, so as to rebuild a life of peace and prosperity. Therefore, in the spirit that every individual is responsible for the fate of the nation, we join together in calling upon the Communist Party authorities to change course, respect the will of the people, respect public opinion, cherish the nation, cherish the country, immediately cease all military actions, unconditionally return political power and the military to the government, obey the central government's military and political orders, abandon armed struggle, and follow the proper path for political parties. It should be understood that political struggle has a clear path, and the nation's lifeline and the people's lives should not be destroyed. The army is meant to protect the country and defend the people, not to turn inward, how can it be used for internal strife and turn to slaughtering compatriots? What to do is for the Communist Party to choose carefully. However, today is the era of democracy, and our people must also think about how to cherish themselves, not be intimidated by violent parties, forget their great responsibilities, but work together to eliminate misfortune.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The communist army is rampant in Shandong, and the situation is tense. According to a telegram received from Shandong by relevant parties: (1) The communist army led by Yang Guofu, with more than 20,000 troops, hundreds of machine guns, and thirty cannons, has infiltrated the Qingqian town area, fifty *li* east of Jinan, with the intention of attacking Jinan city.

The coal pits have been flooded, and all production has been halted. The livelihoods of 100,000 workers are in dire straits, and the impact has led to the decline of all industries and the near bankruptcy of the rural economy.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman reiterated at a press conference today that he is not worried that Soviet policies are creating another war. A reporter asked: Some people in the world now have two questions: one is that the Soviet Union is not cooperating with other countries to ensure world peace, and the other is that Soviet policies will inevitably lead to war. What does the President think? Truman answered with the aforementioned belief. He also said that if the United Nations can proceed according to its proper course, there will be no need for any more summit meetings. A reporter asked: If the policies and institutions of the United Nations regarding the control of Germany need to be revised, will it be necessary for the President to hold a meeting with Marshal Stalin and Premier Attlee? The President replied that he does not advocate holding a special meeting and hopes that the United Nations can take over the various issues handled by the Three-Power Conference within ninety days. Regarding the issue of German control, the Four Allied Powers are conducting negotiations to revise the Potsdam Declaration. The United States advocates that any resolution to be amended must be unanimously approved by the United Nations Control Commission.</p>
<p>Next Year will be the Turning Point for Peace and War</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] A few weeks ago, a reporter predicted that next year will be the turning point for peace and war. Whether we can achieve true peace or humanity will commit suicide with atomic energy will be known by then. During this period, we will encounter one by one the important international issues on which peace depends, and the differences of opinion among the Big Three are especially dangerous, as the harmony and cooperation of the Big Three are the guarantee of peace and security. If the United Nations can accelerate its operation to solve the current difficulties, the chances of avoiding conflict will increase even more. When asked of members of the preparatory committee, they all agreed with this observation. If we know the urgency of the matter and accelerate progress, this peace mechanism can be expected to be established in a month. Then the world's major problems, whether political or economic, can be submitted for discussion. The scope of the problems is extremely wide, and all those that endanger international peace are included, with the control of atomic energy being the most important. If we proceed according to this principle, then problems that were previously considered irrelevant to international affairs and only internal affairs of a country will also be handled by this mechanism. The Chinese civil war is one example, because it endangers world peace. This is not to disrespect national sovereignty. On the contrary, purely domestic affairs are absolutely not allowed to be interfered with, but countries may also submit local problems to the United Nations for discussion, such as the Arab-Jewish conflict. Similar problems can be submitted as precedents in the future.</p>
<p>United Nations Organization Headquarters Location Problem</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The Eighth Special Committee of the United Nations Organization Preparatory Committee met in the afternoon of the 29th to continue discussing the issue of the location of the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization. The central issue is whether the permanent location of the United Nations Organization should be established in an autonomous international zone or in an international zone located within the territory of a country, such as the nature of Tangier. The British representative, Baker, advocated giving the area where the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization is established the greatest possible degree of internationality. He suggested establishing a United Nations Special Zone, where the United Nations can enjoy freedom from interference. Washington, D.C. is one example. Baker also supported the Executive Committee's proposal to establish a United Nations Broadcasting Station, free from the control or supervision of all countries. The Belgian Foreign Minister agreed with the second system, that is, he agreed that the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization should be located in an international zone within the territory of a country. The Dutch representative asked the committee to pay attention to the need to make a decision on the issue he raised yesterday, which was whether the permanent headquarters of the United Nations Organization should be established in a large country or in a small country. He believed that if the decision was favorable to a large country, some precautionary measures should be taken to prevent the danger of strong public opinion interference in the country where the United Nations Organization is located. The Canadian representative believed that both plans are extreme, so he agreed with a compromise system, with half under international management and half relying on the assistance of the host country.</p>

<p>If Iranian Town Uprisings Occur, Soviet Union will Further Increase Troops Stationed in Iran</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, Reuters] The Iranian Ambassador to the United States stated today after calling on President Truman that the Soviet Union has refused to allow the Iranian army to move north. They claim that the Iranian army's move north will lead to bloodshed and threaten that if we attempt to suppress the internal chaos, the Soviet Union will increase the number of Soviet troops stationed in Iran. The Iranian Ambassador told U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes that Iran has lodged two new protests with the Soviet Union: (1) The continued presence of Soviet military personnel in Tehran has created the most tense situation in the area. (2) The rebellion in Azerbaijan is expanding and has now spread to Tabriz. Therefore, we earnestly request the Soviet Ambassador to take urgent steps to eliminate the obstacles to Iranian army reinforcements.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] All efforts by the Iranian government to send reinforcements to the defending army to carry out orders have been blocked by Soviet soldiers. The Soviet army's prohibition of the Iranian army's advance is an infringement of Iranian independence and a violation of the Tehran Agreement. It is reported that the rebel army is rushing towards Tehran, and the situation is quite critical.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The Department of the Army announced today that the U.S. Air Force has lost several aircraft and some crew members due to poor weather conditions on flights from India to Shanghai, so flights have been terminated.

According to a United Press report from Shanghai on Monday, at least eleven aircraft involved in a large-scale flight of 700 U.S. aircraft crashed between Kunming and Shanghai due to adverse weather conditions. Fortunately, several crew members were rescued.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Balkan Soviet Troop Movements Busy; For the Dardanelles Strait, They Demand Turkey Cede Armenian Territory; Tanks and Artillery Practice on the Bulgarian-Turkish Border <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 29th] The situation in the Balkans is once again becoming tense. A contingent of Soviet troops, equipped with tanks and heavy artillery, has recently arrived in the area of Bulgaria bordering Turkey and is conducting exercises. According to reliable sources, the Soviet forces in Bulgaria number 200,000. The Bulgarian army is currently being reorganized and trained by Soviet officers, effectively becoming an auxiliary force to the Soviet Union. The reason for these troop movements is primarily related to two major issues: (1) the Soviet-Turkish dispute over the control of the Dardanelles Strait, and (2) the Soviet demand for the cession of a portion of Turkish Armenia. The Soviet Union is eager to secure a free passage to the Mediterranean. Therefore, at the final meeting of the Big Three in Potsdam, the Soviet Union proposed amending the Montreux Convention. President Truman advocated the organization of an international committee to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait, but the issue remains unresolved. Disputes have already arisen between Turkey and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has further demanded that Turkey cede Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin, three territories in Turkish Armenia, to the Soviet Union, exacerbating the situation. Currently, these three areas have all become strategic locations, of immense value to the Soviet Union. Turkish newspapers have resolutely declared that the Turkish government will never cede the above three territories, maintaining a firm stance with little possibility of compromise. However, it remains questionable whether Turkey has sufficient strength to back up its position. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet Union appears eager to resolve these two major issues as soon as possible. Bulgaria will undoubtedly stand with the Soviet Union. Although the provisional government in Sofia has been criticized by the United Kingdom and the United States for not representing the entire nation and has not been recognized, it is heavily communist in its leanings.</p>

<p>Shanghai University, Great China, China Public</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Shanghai University is preparing for its restoration since the end of the war. In addition to the active efforts of the university authorities, alumni are also working hard to promote the restoration, hoping to quickly restore the university to its former glory. The alumni association aims to strengthen this important work, improve the organization, expand its operations, establish close contact with alumni returning to Shanghai, and hold regular alumni gatherings to jointly plan the revival of the alma mater. It is also understood that alumni returning to Shanghai can register with Mr. Nie Guangdi, secretary of the conference, at the Relief Administration, Executive Yuan, 120 Fuzhou Road.</p>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao] Great China University moved from Shanghai to Chishui during the August 13th War of Resistance. After the national territory was restored, the Shanghai campus has resumed classes. The inland part of the university will also be moved back to Shanghai and merged this winter. It is reliably learned that the part of the university that moved to Chishui was taken over by the Ministry of Education after the war and nationalized. The Shanghai campus, which has already started classes, will also be renamed national university after the merger.</p>
<p>[Further News] Wusong China Public School has been established for more than 40 years. Alumni are all over the country and have made great contributions to the revolution. The school site was destroyed by enemy fire during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Later, in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), due to the proposal of the president and others, the Executive Yuan decided to allocate $100,000 to be used for the restoration of China Public School. Later, with the start of the full-scale War of Resistance on August 13, the restoration was suspended. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the country has been restored, President Yu is concerned about the restoration of China Public School and has telegraphed Shui Xiangyun, an alumnus of the school, to investigate the status of the school property in Wusong in order to plan the restoration. The alumni of the school were very moved by the news and, in addition to replying by telegram to comply, have started alumni registration in the following four locations from today: (1) Liang Zhuming, Room 706, Mainland Building, 9 Jiangxi Road; (2) Shui Xiangyun, Room 211, Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road; (3) Lu Qinxiang, 146 Hardoon Road; (4) Shen Jingru, 62 Zhaozhou Road, Nanshi.

<h3 id="e39">Mingde School Building Dispute <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Education Bureau Sent a Letter Asking for Enforcement, but There Was No Action; Concerned Persons Request Authorities to Conduct a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>[City News] The private Mingde Girls' Primary and Secondary School was originally located at 2 Huajinfang, Huajin Road, Nanshi. The school buildings were built over many years. During the War of Resistance, most of the buildings were destroyed by bombing, leaving only eight small school buildings in the rear. After the National Army withdrew to the west, the school temporarily resumed classes at the current address of 688 Xiafei Road until now. The remaining school buildings in Nanshi were repaired and leased to Zhu Ziqing in June of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943) for a one-year term. The contract clearly stated that the tenant should move out after the term expired, but the tenant repeatedly delayed the move.</p>
<p>Contract Renewed</p>
<p>The school had no choice but to accommodate the situation and continue to sign a contract with Zhu Ziqing, stipulating that the house would be handed over at the end of May of the 34th year of the Republic (1945). However, when the term expired, Zhu Ziqing, fearing that the school would take it back as agreed, secretly reported to the puppet government that the principal of the school, Mei Songxian, was an anti-Japanese element. The houses were then taken over by the Puppet Government's Chongqing Property Management Committee.</p>
<p>Intent to Occupy for a Long Time</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqing stopped paying rent to the school and directly signed a lease with the puppet "Chongqing Property Management Committee" in order to occupy the property for a long time. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the country has been restored, in order to plan for the restoration of the school, the school submitted a detailed report to the Municipal Education Bureau in October, requesting that the school building be ordered to be returned and that the traitor Zhu Ziqing be severely punished. After the Education Bureau sent people to investigate and found that all the facts presented were true, it sent a letter to the Yimiao Branch of the Police Bureau on the first day of last month, asking them to order the house to be returned and instructing the school to bring the original letter and negotiate with the branch to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Limited Time to Move Out</p>
<p>The director of the branch, Director Qian, personally received the school and stated sternly that he would enforce the case in the fastest way possible. If anyone dared to delay, they would be arrested. However, many days passed and no action was taken. After repeated inquiries, he always said that the tenant had been given a limited time to move out. But in fact, nothing had happened. The director of the Yimiao Branch suddenly claimed that the matter was within the scope of civil affairs and that due to legal restrictions, the case could not be enforced. It was reported to the Police Headquarters. The incident was abrupt and caused an uproar. It is said that the school has asked all relevant parties to conduct a thorough investigation of the facts and uphold justice in order to protect education.</p>

Cao arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 28th) on official business.

<p>Yesterday, the weather turned cold suddenly, but the atmosphere in the China Youth Basketball Hall was very enthusiastic. Donghua and Feima first faced each other. Donghua was too relaxed because of its confidence in winning. Feima was determined to fight to the death and was full of energy. Therefore, the Feima team took the lead all the way. After 15 to 9, Donghua did not dare to be negligent. Han Longhai made every shot, so he surpassed and led. In the first half, Che Hua finally led by 25 to 17. In the second half, the war between the cities was still not very tight, but Feima was powerless because of its poor ball skills. In the end, Donghua won by 47 to 29, and Han Longhai alone scored 26 points, which is not easy.</p>
<p>Then the Shantou team played Liangxi. The latter had the help of Yu Huanzi yesterday. The whole team was composed of veterans. The Shantou team reused young players such as He Lide and Ji Nankang. After the start of the game, both sides were very cautious. Liangxi had many opportunities, but they failed to grasp them all due to a lack of assurance. The Shantou team had good connections and was not flustered. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weisong had many wonderful moves. When the first half was over, the Shantou team had 15 points and Liangxi had 8 points. In the second half, Liangxi replaced Yang Yuanlong with Yu Huanzi. The defense became lax, and the offense was not effective. Therefore, the game was lost by one move. The Shantou team was able to control the situation. Chen Qingjiang was very active. Shantou finally defeated this strong opponent. The score was 37 to 20.</p>
<p>Starting at 7:30 this afternoon, there will be two China-US basketball friendly matches in the Qiaozhong Youth Gymnasium in Baisen. It is said that tickets will still cost 100 yuan. The order is as follows:</p>

<p>In Promoting Distribution</p>
<p>Always takes the principle of not giving economic blows to manufacturers and farmers. Therefore, in balancing prices, the bureau will adopt a gradual approach. At the same time, legitimate retailers will also be given legitimate profits. In this way, on the one hand, food prices can be suppressed, and on the other hand, the economic structure of this city can become more stable day by day. In the past, the ratio of rice to flour prices in this city was one dan of rice equals four bags of flour. Currently, the price of flour has been raised due to shortages. The bureau plans to</p>
<p>Suppress Flour Prices</p>
<p>So that it can restore the previous ratio of four to one. According to a grain merchant in this city, the price of flour has fallen sharply recently because it is rumored that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has a large amount of flour for sale. It is said that if the price of flour falls back, the price of rice in this city will fall accordingly.</p>

At present, China's ship tonnage is very small, while the national needs are very urgent. Therefore, all ships must be fully utilized, and shipping routes must also be adjusted. Currently, all ships in the country (including naval transport ships and privately operated commercial ships) are uniformly allocated by the committee.</p>

<p>— Qian Dajun</p>
<p>All citizens of Shanghai, to thank the immortal achievements and the hard work of the soldiers on the battlefield, today use excitement and passionate sincerity to comfort all the officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces in Shanghai. This is completely inspired by the heart, and cannot be described in writing even to the slightest degree.</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces, during this World War, either fought on the sea, or fought in the air, or pierced through [difficult terrain], crossed high mountains, stepped on mud, waded through deep water, faced fierce enemies, and ruthless artillery fire, risking death and life, regardless of everything. Even those who have not personally experienced or witnessed it can imagine the hardship and danger. All our compatriots across the country, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of north, south, east or west, during this war, have always cared about the fighters on the battlefield. This feeling of remembrance is hidden in everyone's heart and becomes deeper as time goes on. Today, all the citizens of Shanghai, in accordance with the regulations of the National Comforting Headquarters, are comforting the National and Allied Forces in Shanghai, simply to offer the sincerity accumulated in their hearts to the fighters on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces, either from the war zones in various parts of China, or from other battlefields, are meeting in Shanghai, an international commercial city, for the first time. It can also be said that today is the first time that millions of citizens of Shanghai have met with the officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces who have long been on the battlefield. The officers and soldiers of the National Forces and the officers and soldiers of the Allied Forces fought side by side in war, sharing life and death. Today, in Shanghai, they are as close as family members. This makes all the citizens of Shanghai feel that only by being based on precious friendship can we promote sincere cooperation and lay the foundation for lasting peace. In addition to being very pleased, everyone should have a common belief: that the world of the future will not allow the flames of aggression to exist again, will not allow the tyranny of dictatorship to exist again, and will not allow cruel wars to exist again. We must work together to ensure world peace and move towards the prosperous road of human civilization, freedom and happiness. In particular, this war occurred on the Chinese battlefield and ended on the Chinese battlefield. Our compatriots suffered the deepest pain and made the greatest sacrifices. We not only care about the National Forces who defended our territory and the Allied Forces who fought side by side with us on various battlefields at all times, but also have the utmost respect for them. Today, all the citizens of Shanghai, based on this feeling and sincere respect, express comfort and gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the National and Allied Forces.</p>
<p>To the Allied Forces in Shanghai, some of whom are about to return home because their mission has been completed and cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time, I would like to express my deep regret on behalf of all the citizens of the city. To some of the Allied Forces who are staying in Shanghai, if our hospitality is not sufficient, I would like to express my infinite apology on behalf of all the citizens of the city.</p>

<p>China vs. U.S. - Six Grand Matches</p>
<p>Impoverished Students - Grateful to Tears</p>
<p>This newspaper has been advocating for a scholarship aid campaign for readers for four and a half years, having held it for nine sessions. During this period, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, and the results have been remarkable. More than 25,000 impoverished students have been assisted. During the War of Resistance, compatriots were displaced and suffered greatly. Fortunately, these lovely impoverished students received assistance from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, enabling them to continue their studies and continue their education. This is of profound significance and merit, directly rescuing those who have dropped out of school and indirectly cultivating talents for the country's restoration and construction. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the light of day has returned, all undertakings urgently need to be restored. The scholarship aid campaign should be actively launched. The current semester is about to end, and my colleagues, adhering to the purpose of scholarship aid over the years, should plan ahead for the fundraising of the tenth scholarship aid fund to avoid digging a well only when thirsty. We hope that wise people from all walks of life will provide assistance, and we will be extremely grateful!</p>
<p>Today, we want to report good news to readers about the scholarship aid campaign. This can be said to be the first great and amazing good news in the Shanghai sports world after the victory of the War of Resistance! The fact is this: Dr. Gu Yuqi, President of Tongde Medical College, and the authorities of this newspaper jointly launched the China-U.S. basketball tournament, aiming to improve basketball skills and connect feelings. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be used for the scholarship aid funds of this newspaper and Tongde Medical College to help countless impoverished students. Zhang Weixiang, General Manager of China Union Chemical Works, is proceeding separately with the invitation of teams and the dates and locations of the matches. At this moment, we can first inform you that the teams will be the most powerful U.S. Military Police Team, U.S. Air Force Team, and U.S. Navy Team stationed in Shanghai. There is no doubt about their outstanding basketball skills. Our country will be represented by the China Union Team and the China Youth Team, which are known as the champions of Shanghai. These many heroes will have a wonderful performance to contribute to the thousands of fans. As for the date of the match, it will be in ten days, and the location will be the most spacious Chinese Sports Field (i.e., the Canidrome) in this city. In short, this is an unprecedented, grand, exciting, and enthusiastic charity event. We hope you will wait and see!</p>
<h3 id="e60">Please Donate to Leprosy Relief <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>This Newspaper Also Accepts Donations on Behalf</p>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association has been established for eighteen years. During this period, in addition to investigating leprosy in our country and engaging in publicity work, it has convened three national leprosy conferences, established branches in major cities, and successively built four or five new-style leprosy hospitals in Nanchang, Xinhua, Hainan, Qingyuan, and Dachang in Shanghai, benefiting the poor and sick. Its merits are great. The Shanghai Leprosy Sanatorium was completed in 1936. Its new-style construction and grand scale are unmatched by any other leprosy hospital in the country. Unfortunately, the war broke out the following year, and Dachang was the first to bear the brunt. In the midst of gunfire and bullets, all the patients were moved to the city. The leprosy hospital at No. 16 Bailinan Road is a temporary hospital after three relocations, covering an area of five or six acres. Although the building is simple, it is sufficient for use. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, due to carelessness with fire, it was suddenly burned down. All equipment, beds, medicines, and patients' clothing were completely destroyed in the fire, with estimated losses of more than 2 million yuan. Fortunately, none of the 70 male and female patients were injured. However, at this time when the west wind is blowing and the weather is getting colder, if relief is not provided, these patients who are barely clothed and sleeping in the open air will inevitably suffer from cold and hunger. There is no shortage of philanthropists in Shanghai. We hope that you will generously donate to save those in distress. Donations can be made at the Social Service Section of Shenbao News and Xinhua Bank Headquarters, Shanghai Trust Company, or sent directly to the China Leprosy Relief Association Office at No. 53, Lane 612, Jing'an Temple Road. The patients urgently need iron beds, cotton clothing, quilts, shoes, and socks, whether new or old, are welcome.</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Contributions of the Little Elementary School Federation (Part Two) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Handa</p>
<p>(III) Strengthening Educational Beliefs and Improving Teaching Methods: Education is inherently a laborious and not always rewarding undertaking. The results of education are often difficult to see immediately, and those who lack confidence rarely find the joy of success to compensate for their hard work. If teachers in each school act independently, even if you are truly striving, you are merely a "lone army." Without like-minded individuals to discuss and encourage each other, it is easy to shake one's beliefs, and even become demoralized. Eventually, teaching is seen as barely better than "unemployment." Once faith and interest in the profession are lost, even excellent teachers will regress, let alone those who were not so excellent to begin with. Loneliness, monotony, lack of confidence, and the inability to muster the courage to strive for improvement are the common plights of elementary school teachers in Shanghai, and a major reason for the declining quality of elementary school teachers. The Little Elementary School Federation is a place to "boost the morale" of demoralized teachers. Membership has increased from two hundred and one to over one thousand two hundred, demonstrating the genuine need for such gatherings among teachers. When over a thousand people gather, they share their grievances and report their teaching experiences. This kind of spiritual interconnectedness and enthusiasm is almost unimaginable unless you observe it firsthand. Many people move forward hand in hand, and even on thorny paths, they feel full of energy, let alone when they are walking on the path of enlightenment? Their weekly Sunday gatherings not only passively listen to educational lectures, but also have other voluntarily participated programs. As far as I know, they also organize Mandarin classes, English classes, singing groups, drama troupes, publishing departments, social gatherings, etc. in different regions. I have heard large choruses combined by several of their schools, and I have also seen entertainment programs individually performed by each sub-region. In such enthusiastic gatherings, it is difficult to find any signs of demoralization. As for the improvement of teaching methods, although I have not conducted investigations in each school, I have heard the opinions expressed by members and read their notebooks, and I know that they have made great progress. Although many teaching and learning problems they raise from their actual experience cannot be completely solved, at least they already know self-criticism and are developing new teaching methods.</p>
<p>Recently, the Federation has resolved to strengthen communication with schools, so that this training association will not be limited to teachers, but also extended to principals. Principals will be invited to participate, and principal forums and principal lectures will be held to completely break the traditional class barriers between principals and teachers, achieving unity from top to bottom and serving education. This is not only the happiness of principals and teachers, but also the happiness of elementary school students and the nation.</p>
<p>I was initially surprised by the lovely spirit of the Little Elementary School Federation. Later, after reading their journal "Teacher Life," I learned that more than thirty educational celebrities and people who are devoted to education in Shanghai are consultants of the Federation. For example, Zhu Junti, Director of the National Education Department; Chen Qingshi, Director of the Secondary Education Department; Yu Qingtang, Director of the Social Education Department; as well as Mr. Chen Heqin, Sun Guiding, Zhang Yaoxiang, Jin Tongxian, Huang Jiping and several other gentlemen, are responsible for guiding them. It is evident that as long as leading educators are willing to come forward to guide them, the training of teachers in Shanghai can be improved. (The End)</p>

<p>The improvement in the intellectual level of the people during the eight years of China's resistance against Japan can be seen from the development of the news and publishing industries in the free areas.</p>
<p>Taking Chongqing alone, there are usually ten newspapers published daily. Among them, the better-selling ones can actually sell over 60,000 copies. This number has already exceeded the sales of most major city newspapers before the war. In terms of magazines, there are at least a hundred types in Chongqing. Among them, the sales of the more popular ones are comparable to when magazine and newspaper mail circulation was smooth throughout the country before the war. Imagine that before the war, major coastal cities and cultural centers such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, etc., and most of the provinces in the country, had fallen into enemy hands. The free areas that could circulate books and periodicals included less than a quarter of the area before the war, only a few provinces with relatively backward cultural standards, and under the difficult material conditions, printing, transportation, and mailing difficulties, and high book prices during the war, the circulation of a publication printed on local newsprint can still be comparable to that before the war, which cannot be said to be a miracle.</p>
<p>As for the atmosphere of reading, it is also very popular in the interior. Inside bookstores and magazine companies, there is a constant stream of people buying and reading books all day long. Especially in the evening, it is even more crowded.</p>
<p>The eight years of the war of resistance has increased the enthusiasm and interest of the Chinese people in reading newspapers, magazines, and books. This is also a phenomenon worthy of joy.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Ciano's Diary and Him <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Fan</p>
<p>In January 1944, the former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was executed by Mussolini in Verona for treason. Hours before his execution, he carefully entrusted five thick volumes of his secretly kept diary to his beloved wife, Edda (Mussolini's daughter), in prison. Edda disguised herself as a poor woman and, with the diaries hidden under her ragged clothes, secretly fled to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Edda had written several times to plead with Mussolini to spare Ciano's life, but Mussolini hated him to the bone and refused to compromise. In the end, Edda, feeling alienated by the public, decided to make the diary public. Ciano's diary, starting in 1939, records the inside story of fascism in great detail and is a highly valuable exposé. Once made public, it caused a worldwide sensation.</p>
<p>It is said that Edda sold this diary to the Chicago Daily News for $75,000. The full book has not yet been published, but snippets have been eagerly carried by newspapers and magazines around the world.</p>
<p>"Ciano's Diary" has sparked a bidding war among publishers around the world. Since the overthrow of the Nazis, publishers have rushed to Germany to search for secret books. The situation is truly fervent, and even scraps of paper from some Nazi leaders have become highly sought after commodities. Most amusing of all, a group of disillusioned politicians and down-and-out military officers are now constantly talking about royalties and manuscript fees. These kinds of business deals are being negotiated in cafes and even in prisons.</p>
<p>"Goering's Notes" are just a few disorganized and incoherent sentences. After they were discovered, they attracted many people like a gold mine. Now a French intelligence officer has gotten hold of them first.</p>
<p>Hitler's mistress, Braun's diary, is another hot commodity. Recently, the American intelligence agencies discovered it in Braun's treasure chest. Some of the contents have now been published. It is an early love story from February to May 1935. Braun believes she has become "the greatest mistress in Germany and the world."</p>
<p>According to the diary, Hitler was often brutal and inhumane when he was in love. He often refused to fulfill the promises he had made, but sometimes he would give her a gift for no reason, without a word of explanation. Hitler would get angry when he saw her go out dancing, but the result of his anger was only avoiding her for a few weeks.</p>
<p>On her twenty-third birthday, the thing she wanted most was a hunting dog. But Hitler didn't even remember her birthday. "He came right on time today—but no dog. He didn't even ask me why I bought so many jewels—a necklace, earrings, a ring (these cost five pounds in total), they are very beautiful, I think he must like them, if he doesn't like them, he should buy me better ones."</p>
<p>As the diary shows, Braun was a greedy and jealous woman. It has not yet revealed anything about Hitler, but these diaries will undoubtedly help us to have a deeper understanding of this demon king. Ciano's Diary, Goering's Notes, and even Braun's Diary, these kinds of documents are not only a satisfaction for the curiosity of the curious, their more important significance is to provide psychologists with some precious research data, perhaps the post-war world will benefit from them and obtain more peace of mind.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Ciano's Diary" has been translated by Chen Fengxiong, the editorial director of the Chongqing National Gazette, and is being serialized in the newspaper's supplement. It has also been typeset for publication in Chongqing as a separate book, and may soon be published in Beiping and Shanghai. "Goering's Notes" have been translated in part by Liu Tongwei, a silks writer in the Chongqing Sweep Daily supplement, and is being serialized in the Sweep supplement.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Unconquerable <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ding</p>
<p>In the summer of 1942, a group of Soviet soldiers were captured by the German army. Among them was a weak and emaciated prisoner of war named Yakov. Zhu Gershvili, is the son of Red Army Commander Stalin. As he walked past the German officers, he violated military protocol by not saluting the German officers. The German officer sternly asked him why he did not salute.</p>
<p>He replied: "I am only captured, not conquered."</p>
<p>Although Stalin's son died, the Soviet Union, with this spirit of not being conquered, finally saw the light of day again.</p>

<p>— Pearl Buck, translated by Zhu</p>
<p>He said, "I don't know what I'm going to do with you myself. Of course, I should hand you over to the police. You are a prisoner—no, don't tell me anything." He saw that the man seemed about to speak, and he raised his hand. "Unless I ask you, don't even tell me your name."</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a while, and the young man closed his eyes and turned to the wall.</p>
<p>"All right," he murmured, his mouth closing into a painful line.</p>
<p>Hana was waiting for Zhenxiong outside the door. He immediately saw that she was in some trouble.</p>
<p>She said, "Zhenxiong, Gongzi just told me that if we hide this person here again, people will no longer be able to stay here. She told me that they are saying that we have lived in America for too long, so we have forgotten to think of our own country first. They think we like Americans."</p>
<p>Zhenxiong hoarsely said, "That's not right, Americans are our enemies. But I have been trained, and I can't watch a person die when I am able to do something about it."</p>
<p>Hana anxiously said, "The servants can't understand this."</p>
<p>He also agreed, "Right."</p>
<p>The two of them seemed unable to say anything more, and life at home continued as usual. The servants became more and more vigilant. They still bowed carefully as before, but the eyes they watched their masters with were cold.</p>
<p>One day, the old gardener said, "It is very clear what our master should do." He had spent his whole life taking care of flowers, especially moss. He built the best moss garden in Japan for Zhenxiong's father, and always swept the bright green carpet clean, so that no leaves or dead needles could spoil its softness. He was now pinching a beetle on a bush, and said, "The son of my old master knows very well what he should do. This person is almost dead, why not let him continue to bleed?"</p>

<h3 id="e67">Funds in the Bond Market Shift, Trends in Chinese Stocks Rejuvenate <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Gold Prices Rise Slightly, US Dollars Stable</p>
<p>Spot gold prices still did not break free from fluctuation yesterday. Gold prices in other ports were reported to be low, and the market still appeared weak. However, due to loose capital positions, there was no lack of households buying on dips, and thus gradually rebounded. As a result, it closed up slightly by 10,000 compared to the previous session, and the trend seemed to improve slightly. Gold ornaments at silver shops were listed at 84,000, tael silver remained at 650, and silver dollars were stable, fluctuating between 455 and 460. The discount was still weak due to the lack of strength in the gold market and the lack of substantial outlets, but the underlying trend seemed stable, around 1.3 to 1.6 yesterday.</p>
<p>The US dollar was also extremely stable, fluctuating around 1,310 yuan. As a result, it closed up slightly by five yuan compared to the previous session. There was little activity in Hong Kong dollars, and as a result, it declined slightly. Australian pounds were still worth half of a US dollar, and rupees were weakly received at 0.25, extremely stable.</p>
<p>Although the buying interest in public bonds did not seem to stop, there was no lack of people wary of high prices. The city rose and fell rapidly, and the market was extremely changeable. Ultimately, most participants were optimistic about Chinese blue-chip stocks. Although the market appeared firm and strong, Category C once hit a high price of 620 yuan, then plummeted by more than 100 yuan. Although it rebounded slightly at the end, it ultimately felt powerless. As a result, hot issues in Category C and E declined slightly by ten yuan compared to the previous day, while unpopular issues in Categories A, B, and D fell by sixty yuan, and the price difference widened even more.</p>
<p>Due to consecutive days of cautious gains, the rising trend in Chinese stocks had been suppressed for a long time. With funds from the bond market continuously flowing in, even more poured in yesterday. A large number of public employees and activist elements participated in groups, and major investors also moved in to support factories. As a result, it was a surprise. As a result, large stocks performed well, increasing by 40 to 70 yuan, while small stocks each rose by more than five yuan. Barring external shocks, the trend is set to rejuvenate.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still flat at the beginning, and as a result, they also followed the trend of Chinese stocks to become firm and strong. Ewo Cotton Mill led the way, rising from around 1,500 to over 1,600. Among the smaller stocks, Ewo Transfers were popular, with many buyers, and are about to approach the 400 mark. As a result, they closed up by about 10% compared to the previous session.</p>
<p>The prices of various grains were weak yesterday. The rice market was slow as retail sales turned sluggish, and medium- and low-quality rice declined slightly by 100 to 200 yuan, forming a fluctuating situation. The price of oil fell by another 1,000 yuan as shipments of Qingdao barrel oil continued to pour in. Flour sales were also sluggish, and the processing of soybeans remained weak. The situation was uninspired.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn continued to decline because some manufacturers had completed export tax inspection procedures, and the supply of spot goods was relatively abundant. At the same time, the demand in Hankou and Chongqing turned sluggish, so prices could not be sustained. Fine yarn fell by 50,000 to 60,000, 20-count yarn fell by 10,000 to 20,000, and coarse yarn below 16-count fell slightly, about 5,000. Only inland merchants added some to their allocations throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sales of knitted goods were scarce and continued to decline. Some types remained at their original prices. Yarn prices did not rebound, and most factories were unwilling to sell at market prices. Those sold on the market were all speculators.</p>
<p>The market for dyes appeared to be thriving on the outside, but actual sales were still stagnant. Brokers were just propping up the market, so market prices continued to decline. The actual trading and quotations depend on supply and demand. Non-industry speculators heard that the German dye factories had been destroyed by the Allied forces and the source was cut off, so they still tried to support the market.</p>
