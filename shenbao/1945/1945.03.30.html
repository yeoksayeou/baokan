<h3>通過兩要案內容</h3>
<p>全部提案，經縝密討論結果，已有切要而具體之議案議決通過，刻正由大會秘書處積極整理中，一俟整理完竣，即將正式發表。其中最重要者計有下列二案：</p>
<h3>繼承國父遺志　完成國民革命</h3>
<p>（一）「展開統一救國運動，繼承國父遺志，完成國民革命案」。</p>
<p>理由　中國自辛亥革命以來，內憂外患交相前迫，未能進爲現代國家，中日事變之後，隨國際關係之演變，國內局面益形分裂，全國支離破碎，人民顛沛流離，全民所殷望之自主獨立平等自由，不知何日得能實現，揆其原因，雖甚複雜，然爲我國民族發展之最大障碍者，要不外爲資本帝國主義之侵略，黨派割據之糾紛及共產勢力之擾亂，三者相互牽繞，循環爲禍，於是促成中國過去之衰弱與目前之難局。</p>
<p>故今日而言救國，必先洞察禍亂之源，自反侵略反割據反共產做起，而欲求此三者之成功，捨繼承國父遺志完成國民革命外，更無其他途徑，惟有完成國民革命，始能對抗資本帝國主義之侵略，使中國社會脫離半殖民地半封建之性格，惟有完成國民革命，始能消滅黨派割據的糾紛，建設革新的有力的政治體制，亦惟有完成國民革命，始能遏止共產思想的滋長，防範共產勢力的蔓延。</p>
<p>完成國民革命，旣爲救中國之唯一的正家路綫，則全國同胞自當以此爲目標，集結總力以赴，凡過去拘執於黨派觀念階段，意識地域偏見者，均當一律放棄，在國家民族最高至上之原則下，展開統一救國運動，結成統一救國陣綫，精誠團結，共爲國民革命而努力，由國民之團結，形成政治力批之團結的思想，主義的統一，促成行動步驟的統一，然後方足以建設現代國家，爭取國家民族之獨立自主平等自由，故吾人提議展開統一救國運動，同時並確定以三民主義爲統一救國策動之指導原理，奉行國父遺敎，以求國民理念統一，再以完成國民組織，以求國民力量的團結，破除國家民族之障碍，以求國民革命之成功。情勢嚴重，國難方殷，戰局之結束，未必即是中國問題之解決，國人當一致覺悟，團結奮鬥，以求國家民族之永久生存，是否有當，敬請公決。</p>
<h3>松島部長闡述　琉球沖繩戰局　　將令敵人更大出血</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部常會，於昨日下午舉行，到松島部長松本大尉及各報記者多人，松島部長對太平洋戰局及琉球羣島之戰，將予敵人以更大之出血，閘述頗詳。茲誌其概要如次：</p>
<p>琉球冲繩攻擊目標</p>
<p>美國第五艦隊現以琉球冲繩爲攻擊目標，在此一帶地區，集中有艦艇百艘，一部份戰艦巡洋艦等向沖繩島各地實行艦砲射擊，同時另一部份兵力在慶良間列島登陸，馬里亞那間則以B29型機作遠距離轟炸，其第五十八機動部隊之艦載機對九州各重要地區空襲，企圖切斷日軍後方路綫。是以南西諸島之戰局，行見激烈化，敵人自佔據硫黃島後，即以南西諸島爲攻擊目標。茲其計劃，已由言論形諸事實矣。</p>
<p>敵美兵力已較薄弱</p>
<p>此次敵人之作戰計劃，當爲華盛頓作戰會議時所決定，由三月十七日其機動部隊攻擊九州之行動作爲開端，現在則正在作登陸之準備。此次美軍作戰之特徵，計有三點：（一）敵人兵力比較過去低減，根據俘虜所供，敵軍於攻擊九州作戰時，受到意外之捐失極鉅，故預料此次作戰，其兵力必較　班島菲律賓島之役薄弱多多。（二）敵軍之作戰準備，甚爲遲緩，現冲繩方面敵人之主力運輸部隊，尙未到達。（三）兵員質素不良，份子不整齊，美軍中發現年在六十以上之童頭齒豁者，其原因由於過去作戰時，敵人於人的資源上受損過鉅，人力不足，乃有此種現象。反之日軍處於有利地形，對敵人之　擊戰甚爲徹底，予敵人以重創，如二十八日日大本營所發表，冲繩附近沉毀敵戰艦巡洋艦等三十一艘，敵方兵力之損失，竟達全數三分之一。</p>
<p>戰事將更激烈殘酷</p>
<p>據二十一日紐約合衆社電訊之琉球島之攻擊戰，或將比較硫黃島爲易云云，此係美人之看法，究竟容易與否，當以實際之戰况表現之。以琉球島戰略上之價値說，與硫黃取塞班島不同，琉球之地位在中日兩國防衛上，爲中和地帶，無論從九州台灣或中國出發，在作戰上均爲可以生效者，是以今後日美在琉球之戰，決爲激烈殘酷之戰。茲更將過去英美在作戰上之成果及其兵力，試爲申論之如次：</p>
<p>將令敵人更大出血</p>
<p>去年六月間英美在歐洲諾曼第登陸作戰，最初動用兵力十二萬四千人，大小艦艇三千四百九十五艘，過去硫黃島之登陸戰，美海兵隊爲六萬人，艦艇八百艘，其兵員共二十二萬人，菲律賓仁牙因之登陸戰，最初四天美動用兵力十五萬人，艦艇一千零三十三艘，協助兵員爲二十七萬三千人。我人鑒於已往諸戰役，可知美人在太平洋上作戰，需要多少兵力？由此而聯想，現在其所準備之兵力與硫黃島戰役時，相差又爲多少？琉球島之地形爲片段構成之山岳地帶，故在島上建築飛機塲殊不容易，氣候極熱，水源缺乏，當此時季，毒蛇最多，（松島部長述其過去之回憶云，於二十四歲充任海軍中尉時，曾前往琉球島，見當地之三味綫—樂器上即用蛇皮爲鼓，當地蛇類之多，可以想見。）故我人確信此次琉球戰役，比較塞班島及硫黃島之戰，將令敵人以更大之出血也。</p>
<p>駁斥敵美虛偽宣傳</p>
<p>最後松島部長稱近來美國於宣傳上，其步調已極凌亂，如尼米資司令部發表，三月十七日以來，在九州瀨戶內海曾擊毀日艦艇十七八艘云云，其實均與事實不符，若呆如美方所傳，則至少其所報告之數字中，對於船名式樣大小載重等等，必更詳爲叙明。同時由舊金山或新德里所發表之日方損害數字，又各不相同，敵方於宣傳上常施用一根據日方報道」云云之慣技，其所以如此者，無非希望增進中國人甚至日本人，對其消息之確信，故日方所無之消息，往往可於其不確之報道中見之也。</p>
<p>辦法</p>
<p>（一）以統一救國之主張，爲本次會議宣言之中心，（二）以國父遺敎爲統一救國運動之指導原量，（三）通電全國及海外同胞。關明統一救國之主張，請一致奮起，共策進行，幷聯合各黨各派各地各界，結成統一救國同盟。</p>
<h3>保障言論自由　確立民意機構</h3>
<p>（二）「請政府保障人民言論集會自由，採納民意機關案」。</p>
<p>理由　政治之積極目的。爲謀民衆之生存與幸福，有人民始有政治，無人民即無政府，此爲一定一易之理，故在今日無論對內對外，均須集結國民總力，與政府共赴事功，始足以克服時艱，應付難局，故採納民意應視平時尤爲重要。必須下情可以上達，而後政府方能據以爲賢明施策，必須上意可以下宣，而後民衆方能依以爲妥善之協力，政府對民衆之痛苦，當予以可能之解除，民衆對政府之困難，應有充分之理解，彼此破除難關，開誠協商，官民一體，上下一心，然後方能樹立强有力之革新體制。北方數年來，曾有各級聯合協議會之舉行，與各級行政機構互相配合，官民聚首一堂，協議一切問題，以求政治之革新，行政之推進，頗著成效，并曾蒙汪故主席親臨致訓，慰勉有加，此種辦法，全國似可普遍推行，以確立民意機構。時局迫切，爲完成內求復興，外求解放之大業，國人當精誠團結，共同奮鬥，政府與人民尤當齊一步伐，共濟時艱。爲此謹提議，請政府保障人民言論集會自由，採納民意，確立民意機關，是否有當，敬請公決。</p>
<p>辦法</p>
<p>（一）請政府頒布保障人民言論集會自由令，（二）請大會要求政府領遵民衆運動之構機予以統一，幷積極强化展開廣大深入之民衆運動，（三）民意機關應定名爲各級參議會，（四）參議會與現行各級行政機構配合設置之，中央設全國參議會，各地設各地參議會　（五）參議會以民衆推選之代表構成之，代表之任期爲一年，（六）各級參議會之會期，每年舉行常會一次，必要時召開臨時會議，（七）各級參議會開會時，各級行政長官須出席會議，說明及解答，（八）各級參議會組織條例，由政府健分佈布施行之。</p>
<h3>紀念先烈　典禮隆重</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　二十九日爲革命先烈紀念日，國府爲迫念革命先烈生前致力國民革命之勳功偉業，特於上午九時在國民政府大禮堂隆重舉行紀念典禮，國府陳代主席以下各院部會處文武官員三百餘人均參與，禮堂情緒莊嚴肅穆，典禮在哀悼氣氛中進行。九時正，陳代主席御黑色國民禮服，於全體肅立恭迎，軍樂鏗鏘聲中蒞止，典禮即於樂聲中開始，主席就位後，全體肅立，唱國歌，向國旗及國父遺像行最敬禮，繼由主席恭讀國父遺囑，全體向革命先烈靈位行敬禮，並靜默誌哀，默畢，主席於哀樂聲中，向革命先烈靈位獻花，典禮遂成。</p>
<h3>日軍準備萬全撤廢徵兵限制</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日陸軍爲期本土決戰軍備萬全起見，此次特修正陸軍召集規則，即將過去僅適用於戰地之征兵檢查及召集十七歲以上少壯在鄕軍人之地域限制，予以撤廢，對日本土全域未滿適齡之鄕軍人，於必要時得隨時如集。</p>
<h3>蔡培大使　返國述職</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　國府駐日大使蔡培氏，爲向中樞述職，並請示機宜，日前啓程返國，二十八日抵達首都。</p>
<p>實現全面和平，保存國家元氣！</p>
<h3>王蔭泰翊贊有功　給特級同光勛章　國府昨日發表明令</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　華北政委會委員長王蔭泰，翊贊大計，卓著勛勞，國府特於還都五周年紀念日發表明令，給予特級同光勛章，以彰功勛。玆誌府令如下：國府令，三十四年三月二十九日，王蔭泰給予特級同光勛章，此令，代理主席陳公博。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>慶祝國府還都　五周年紀念</h3>
<p>今天是國民政府還都五周年紀念之日，五年以前注故主席領導和運，不避艱危，五年以來，辛苦奮鬥，可說無日不在緊張局面之中。而在此一年中，不幸汪主席積勞病故，未能及見和運完成，我們在今天慶祝國府還都紀念之際，更表示無限的敬念。</p>
<p>過去在國府還都三周年四周年紀念之日，我們均曾爲文慶祝，並抒述期望。今天我們再檢討一年以來的國事經過，以及環顧當前的內外情勢，深覺過去所殷切期待的種種問題，還是今天所應提出的問題。</p>
<p>第一，改善民生問題。昨前兩年前的今日我們提出的：「凡是重慶方面對於國家與人民之利益，所不能解決之問題，主要者如糧食問題，物價問題，貪汚問題，一切有關改善人民生活之問題，希望南京國民政府必須有力量，有辦法，謀求澈底解決。同時，凡重慶方面所言所行而已經失敗者，國民政府決不再蹈覆轍。」自從陳代主席主持中樞以後，首先以澄淸吏治，消滅貪汚爲施政前提，對於貪汚問題，總算已有初步的整飭。至於物價問題，在首都首先組織平價維紀委員會，對於囤積操縱的取締，頗見成效。本市對於平價工作，切實推進，投機抬價之風，亦見斂跡。京滬兩地的平價施策，當然發生領導作用，不過，糧食問題，居於物價的中心地位，這問題未能獲得解決，則一切平價工作，不免事倍功半。所以，我們希望今後側重全力於糧食問題之解決，以謀眞正的改善民生。</p>
<p>第二，革新政治問題。我們主張革新政治的前提，一是建立專家政治，二是建立民意機關。專家政治，就是用人唯才主義，一面肅淸貪汚，淘汰冗庸。使政治上形成新興精神，增進效率。這在一年之中，政府已經注意調整人事，不過，還須進一步起用新進人才。其次爲求溝通官民意見，使官民打成一片，則建立民意機關，實爲迫要，目前首都正在舉行的各省市民衆代表會議，雖可以說溝通民意的發軔，可是，我們希望進一步促成眞正的民意機構，使民意有經常表達的機會。</p>
<p>第三，目前大東亞戰局日向決戰之途迫進，我們昨天說過，無論敵美企圖向日本本土作戰，或向中國大陸作戰，中日兩國軍民都應視同一體的奮起應戰，惟有以更加團結一致的力量才足以應付頑敵。而盟邦目前的軍政部署，我們可以看出都以爭取時間，迅速切實爲唯一條件。我們的一切措置，當然也須迅速以爭取時間，切寶而不尙空談。</p>
<p>陳代主席日前對各省市民衆代表大會致訓中說：「國家民族之痛苦，唯國人之努力方能解除，國人切身之苦痛，亦唯有在國家民族苦痛解除之後，方能解脫。」我們自當以全民的努力在政府領導之下，先求解除國家民族之苦痛。但同時，我們也不能忽略減少人民不必要的苦痛，是足以加强政府所需要人民貢獻的努力。</p>

<h3>日航空部隊繼續攻撃　沉毀敵利用蘇船卅艘　日水上部隊奇襲亦獲戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日大本營二十九日下午四時發表：日航空部隊繼續攻擊冲繩本島周圍之敵來攻部隊，由三月二十六日至二十八日止，計收獲確認之戰果如决：擊沉戰艦一艘，巡洋艦六艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，驅逐艦七艘，掃海艇一艘，撃傷戰艦或巡洋艦九艘，驅逐艦三艘，運輸艦二艘。</p>
<p>某某基地二十九日中央社電冲繩方面敵之機動部隊，現仍繼續蠢動，日軍亦在續行猛攻。二十八日，因天氣不良，彼此之空戰幾乎停頓，敵機動部隊現仍對伊江島及冲繩本島南部地區繼續艦砲射撃。日水上部隊二十七日夜間試行奋襲，轟沉敵巡洋艦二艘，撃傷驅逐艦艘，轟沉掃海艘一艘。</p>
<p>敵圖侵攻琉球本島</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　二雨具入日下午四時四十分頃，敵艦載機，約八九十架，曾，來襲九州東南部，其中七八十架艦載機一羣，來襲宮崎縣，另十架來襲鹿兒島。敵軍以一部兵力於慶良間列島登陸，同時並對琉球本島繼續砲撃，企圖於該島登陸，然遭日軍航空部隊不斷強襲，敵又爲切斷沖繩後連絡，故乃再出動機動部隊北上。敵方行動主要目的，在攻撃九</p>
<p>州東南部之日方主要飛機塲及展開航空撃滅戰。二十八日畫間，馬里亞納基地之B29型機，前後六度飛至朝鮮，九州，　戶內海方面及關東地方，偵察日空軍動向，按諸此等事實，可知敵軍對琉球本島發動侵攻作戰，已迫於眉睫。</p>
<h3>美軍侵南西羣島爲純粹戰略意圖</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　敵美舉海兵全力，出現於日本南西羣島近海，二十五日終以一部兵力在冲繩本島西方二十餘公里之慶良間列島登陸，依敵陸海軍在南西羣島海域集中之狀况及目前戰略之執抝性，推測敵美企圖在冲繩本島登陸作戰之舉，定屬無疑。南西羣島距九州六百五十公里，距台灣六百公里，位於九州·食灣間日軍戰略基地之中央，形成戰略上之典型凹角。敵美此次攻擊，乃爲突入日方堅强四角陣地心臟部之冒險行動，敵艦船在日軍左右兩翼空軍之果敢攻襲下，敵艦船羣定受重大損傷。由於敵美此次之勉力作戰，可知美國本身戰略上之無謀，然而不得不勉强推進號爭，敵美攻擊南西諸島之主要目的，在於靠民堅強之空軍基地，以壓制對日航空包圍圈，加强破壞日方作戰泉源之戰略轟炸。同時，並擬以該地之空軍力量，威脅中·日·滿及南方地域之交通動脈，俾使對日戰局再進一步，除此純粹戰略企圖外，且含有政治意圖之投機作戰，此種事實歷歷可證。四月二十五日之舊金山會議目的，亦以戰後國際處理案爲召開會議之骨幹，就太平洋戰局現狀觀之，雖已將對日包圍圈壓制至某種程度，然就現在情形觀之，不能謂已確定對日作戰之優勢，爰去春以來，日軍在大陸戰綫中，由於連續不斷之先制攻擊，渝軍痛受重創，而在大陸縱斷路打通後，形成與南方有利連繫之戰略地帶，在掃除法越敵性後，聯結中國大陸與南方地域間之日軍陣勢，益趨堅固。此外，敵軍在呂宋島之損失及最近硫黃島所受創傷，實際已達登陸兵力之七成三分，此項統計，實爲太平洋戰域內之最高紀錄。由此，可聯想美軍今後接近日本本土時之犧牲數量矣。如是，太平洋戰爭之前途，不容逆睹，且不能相信美國宣傳之事實，此乃世界各國共有之深刻印象。美國國民對日本一億國民此種「肉彈攻擊」精神，深爲稱頌，美軍集結總力攻擊日本本土之損害，將更慘重，日不寒而慄，敵美究以何種事實打破國際及國內不安空氣，已如上述，故急速向南西羣島發動攻勢，實爲純粹之戰略意圖。</p>
<h3>「在日本政治會」定今日成立　翼贊政治會同時解散</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　醞釀已久之日本新政治結社「大日本政治會」，決定推戴南决郞陸軍大將爲總裁，因各項籌備工作業已就緒，特定三十日下午二時於衆院內中央食堂舉行成立大會。是日，小林躋造海軍大將及各受聘者將全部出席，於行禮儀式後，即推選主席，報告籌備委員會之經過及該會名稱·宣言綱領等事項，繼即推舉南次郞大將爲總裁，並由南總裁致詞，嗣即宣告翼贊政治會之解散儀式，而由小林總裁致詞及全員代表伍堂卓雄氏致謝詞，最後即行解散</p>
<h3>敵機空襲九州遭日方反撃</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　二十八日下午四時四十分許，敵艦上機的百三十架，來襲九州東南部及南部之航空基地，遭受日方反擊，日方殆無損害，敵之來襲目的，似係威力偵察。</p>
<p>大陸基地二十九日中央社電　繼續空襲北九州之敵B29型機，係由馬里亞納基地出發，歷來担任空襲九州方面之敵機，多爲大陸深處之B29型，最近該機移往馬里亞納方面，敵美痛感長途補給上之困難，殊堪注目。越大西洋經阿拉伯，阿非利加，印度等大陸補給路，令物量優厚之敵美亦感不敷，敵軍爲減輕B29型補給燃料消費量之勞力，並補充馬里亞納基地B29型之投害，目前業將集中於印度加爾各答基地羣之B29型大部移至馬里亞納，藉使担任空襲九州之任務。由上述事實證明，去歲春季以來，大陸之日軍航空戰力異常雄厚，同時在空　日本本土時，每遭大陸日機之猛擊。</p>
<h3>馬尼刺東方日軍猛反攻　右翼已突入桑馬迭歐</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫二十九日中央社電　馬尼刺東方據點右翼之戰況，因日軍勇猛反攻，故現在仍爲日方占擾勢。綠日右翼部隊將侵入陣內之敵軍撃退後，即突入重要攻熱據點之　馬迭歐，二十三日夜殲滅敵軍殘餘部隊後，即固守該地，是故日軍部隊對桑馬迭歐附近之敵軍集中點及營幕地帶加以砲擊，使之燃燒，並壯烈對之突擊，尤以馬尼刺郊外庫巵俄附近發生之火最爲熾烈，敵彈藥觸火而發生爆炸。該夜半島馬里基那附近之敵戰車部隊四十餘輛，亦因之倉惶向南方退却，此方面之日軍，二十四，五兩日，復仍賡續反攻，又日右翼部隊進攻桑馬迭歐西方之敵軍。同時，並以一部兵力南下，突入馬巢基那。又二十五日夜，梅卡亞方面與敵背面連絡綫以重大之威脅，另一隊突破陣綫，向馬吉列營地前進，是夜，該營地方面發生數次大爆炸，但敵軍對日軍中央陣地仍續行頑抗攻擊，並新由南方增强兵力的一師，對日軍左翼加緊壓迫，連日於安其保魯東方一帶展開激烈陣地戳，但刻下戰綫仍無多大變化。</p>
<h3>三寳顏日軍邀戰果</h3>
<p>菲律賓基地二十九日中央社電　敵目三賓顏登陸至二十五日之十六日間，守備該地之日陸海軍部隊所獲之主要戰果如决：殺傷人員約五千五百名，擱置破壞戰車四十九輛，裝甲軍十三輛，向動貨車三十三輛，破壞燒毀火砲九門，璣槍十三挺，飛行機庫一所，幕舍九處，汽油罐三百個，子彈軍糧食庫多處。</p>
<h3>美機施濫炸日嚴重搞議</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日政府對於去年十月十日，敵機動部隊濫施轟炸冲繩島那覇，曾促美國政府之注意，並對殺戮無辜市民之暴慮行爲，基於人道的立塲及國際法上之理念，提出嚴重抗議，然迄今未曾接獲任何答覆。且其後B29機空襲本土時，敏集中轟炸非軍事之目標，尤於二月二十五日，三月十日，十四日，十七日等，對東京，名古屋，大阪，神戶等地濫加轟炸。日政府對於迭經促其注意而猶不反省之殘忍，係保留抗議之權利及行動之自由，正向美國政府提問責任，美方今日完全運反人這原則及國際法規，迭次公然實施濫炸，實令人憤恨。</p>
<h3>德決不求和柏林官方再度闢謠</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：自瑞典京城發生德外部經濟司之許諾爾公使在瑞京試探和平之謠傳後，德外交部特發表聲明，申述許氏此行乃在談判德瑞經濟關係上之技術問題，毫無其他使命，發言人鄭重申述德國從未有試探和平之舉，今後亦決不乞和。</p>
<h3>萊因下游美軍作扇形推進　曼恩河畔戰事尤激烈</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：萊因河下游交戰雙方壓力相等，惟美第一軍則於維斯脫華爾特突入處，續以扇形姿態向東及東南推進，左翼抵上西格山谷區之哈琛堡，其餘兩路敵軍則於抵狄倫堡·威兹拉一綫後，爲德軍所阻，該兩路敵軍之目標乃爲杜林根區，故其行動實頗堪注意。另有敵軍一部則向南推進，經巴特埃姆斯，企圖包抄德軍萊因河防綫之背。法蘭克福方面自美第三軍渡曼恩河後，復有敵軍越　諾斯公路前來呼應，法蘭克福之火車站有猛烈爭奪戰，哈諾方面敵無甚發展。</p>
<h3>英人厭倦戰爭</h3>
<p>美國某特派員曾論最近的倫敦情勢說：「世上沒有一處像倫敦那樣沉於不幸絕望的深淵中了，英國人已完全倦於戰爭了。」綜合來自倫敦的情報，這未必是誇張的，邱吉爾在其克里米亞會談的報告演說中，曾强調前途的光明，以圖鼓舞沉滯的民衆士氣。實際上，英國的現狀可說比外界所想像的更壞。記者今日和剛從倫敦歸米的某「國際情勢通」晤談以後，感觸益深。他曾因半官性質的事務在倫敦滯留三個月，其間且和英國當局往來，是一個熟悉英國上下情形的人物，他的觀察頗可推重。茲將他的談話要點介紹於下。</p>
<p>英國報章現正努力宣傳德國至今即將崩潰，而邱吉亦與這種宣傳的步驟一致，在其議會的演說中叙述其希望的觀測。但究其內容，這種宣傳無非是英國戰爭指導者想緩和英國人民精神上的苦痛而已，換一句話說，不過是想唆使英國人民支持到比德國稍長一分鐘一杪鐘的政治强心針。英國倦於戰爭的理由有許多，其根本原因，則爲今日以前的多决戰爭中，操縱政府而爲英國眞正指導階級的所謂特權階級，現已失去了戰爭目的。此由英國的對蘇態度可以明之。英國人的心理，蘇聯打擊德國的戰鬥力固然是好的，但在此以上則可憂了。如果蘇聯所作所爲的在此以上，英國人就要憂慮着戰後的蘇聯了。以其特權階級爲中樞的大英帝國，如果從世界王座淪於政治，社會的混亂渦中，這當然不是英國人所好的。他們知道若無蘇聯的協助，殊難打敗德國，所以不能沒有盟國蘇聯。可是，他們不敢設想蘇聯在戰後能成社會上政治上的勝利者，而事實上他們政治上的直覺又使他們不得不相信這點。這就是潛行於倫敦政界的疑惑，昏迷，澀滯。這也是政治家，外交官，著述家，交相强調英國在和平戰中也非取得勝利不可的理由。</p>
<p>說到和平戰中誰是勝利者，第一是蘇聯，其次要算美國。關於克里米亞會談，工黨領袖格林伍特曾嘆息道：「一切重大的國際會議，均在英國之外舉行，實在不勝遺憾之至。今日，英美蘇三國，英國頗有屈居第三位之象。」他的嘆息，或許是向特權階級訴說的，並不是對勞動階級說的，因爲應聯的勝過德國，勝過英國，或勝過全世界，在勞動階級是無關痛癢</p>
<p>另一個對手是美國，英國迫於戰爭的必要，已將許多大英帝國的基地提供美國。以擁有「帝國」自負的人，在有企圖建立「帝國」的別國出現時，當然感到不快。在英國人的心底裏，美國人是常在大西洋那方向上爬的。他們的向上爬，到了風雲際會的時候，一變而成建立帝國的野心，要求讓予英國獨覇下的弱國保護者的地位，這事對於英國，自然是非常難堪的。還有一點更使英國驚恐的，不是美國的領土侵略而是其精神侵略。駐在英國本部的美兵，薪俸比英兵不啻多上十倍，極易博得英國婦人的歡心，甚至使她們懷孕。今日，有許多十四歲左右的英國少女，竟產下了私生子。這是可驚的事實。曾經到過英國殖民地的人，誰都知道英國人極端尊重本國婦女，茍和當地土民發生糾葛時，心裘就老大不高興。然而今日爲了跑到大英帝國心臟部來的美國兵，英國的婦女，甚至上流貴婦也逐漸成爲別人的俎上肉了。</p>
<p>當英國正如上述一般受着別國恐嚇時，德國的V一號·V二號又不斷襲擊英倫三島，使其受到平均三幢房壁中總有一幢燬壞的損失，英人的驚愕實在想像以上。軍需損害縱然不大，精神上的打擊却是絕大的。這種沒有聲音，飛得比聲音更快的可怕東西，可以在行路的時候，睡覺的時候或吃飯的時候突然從空而降。譬如拿我自已的經歷來說，某晚剛剛躺在床上朦朧睡去時，突然被掀到院子裏的樹上。瞬息間不知發生了什麼事情，幸而身體未受重傷。這種飛來橫禍的可能性，使人惴惴不安。倫敦市民的神經疲　，誠非無因。邱吉爾的大聲宣傳戰爭今將告終，亦因此故。（模本特派員斯德哥爾摩電十一電）（譯自三月十三日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>長寗警局破獲　西法華賭窟</h3>
<p>本市自消滅烟賭後，詎一般賭棍，又有約地聚賭之舉。於本月二十七日深夜，在西法華惠樂茶園內，一般賭徒，正在大賭搖缸，興高彩烈之際，被長寗路分局探悉，派警逕往，當塲拘獲賭徒張永東</p>
<p>今（三十）日爲國府還都五週紀念，市警察局循例休假一天，惟爲防止不法奸宄乘機活躍擾亂治安起見，於昨晚起實施特別戒備，各分局仍不予休假，並出動全體員警輪班</p>

<h3>中儲及銀團貸款　協助收買物資　貸款數額相當鉅大</h3>

<h3>最純潔最切實的同情　小學生捐贈「讀過舊書」</h3>
<p>本報舉辦義務小學十一所，旬日以來，引起各方面贊助，尤其是學校及小學生們，同情失學，捐款贈書，響應最力。昨天有大任小學中高年級全體同學，及寗波旅滬同鄕會第一小學五年級全體學生來函，因爲聽到老師告訴了本報辦義校的消息，就自動以合羣的同情力量，節省糖菜綫點心費，並發起以讀過的舊書捐贈運動，我們覺得這是最純潔最切實的贊助。我們可以興奮的說，如果普遍地得到全市小學生純潔與切實的共鳴，我們所辦的十所義務學校的基礎，就可以寄託在他們的同情心上。但是，我們希望義校的範圍再加擴大，當然希望社會上其他各界的有力份子也起來贊助，難道社會上的成人們，尤其是有力份子就沒有小學生的熱倩嗎？敬請讀一讀小學生們的來信吧！</p>
<p>其一：「上星期聽我們老師說貴報要辦義務學校十所，爲救濟外面許多的失學兒童，我們聽了，眞覺萬分興奮。因爲我們很是幸運，雖然在這樣困難的時候，還能繼續求學，但是，當我們看到那一羣流浪在街頭，徘徊在校門外的小同胞們，心裏時常感到無限的悲傷。同樣是國家未來的主人翁，爲什麼他們的遭遇，與我們相差得這樣遠呢！</p>
<p>現在知道諸位先生熱心倡辦義務學校以後，我們替　　失學的小朋友，快樂得幾乎要跳起來，因爲他們也有了求學的機會。所以我們有幾位同學，把這幾天的　　　及點心　，節省下來，共一萬五千二百元，及我們全體同學將以前用過的舊書，共八百三十九本，一起貢獻給貴報館。希望能　　設幾所義校，　救幾個「亮眼瞎子」，爲國家多造出幾個有用的人才，更希望全上海的小朋友們，多多響應，盡自己的力量，去帮助他人。　是，我們尙在求學時代，一切依靠家庭，雖心有餘，而力不足，所捐也有限。所以我們深切地盼望着各界有力人士，能多多捐助，使事業成功。私立大任小學中高年級全體同學鞠躬。」</p>
<p>其二：「我們自從各位老師口中得到貴報館發起義學運動消息後，全校的同學都表示熱烈的同情和贊助，尤其是年幼的一　，格外起勁，立刻把幾天來省下的點心錢，先後奉呈，充作義學金。我們一級的同學，爲了這事，還開了一次級會，討論了許多時侯，大家都認爲「義學運動」在今天是更迫切的需要。我們的級長邱蘭芬君說：　募「義學金」，除深盼社會人士羣起　應外，最好再能動員全市在求學的小朋友，每個人省下一只大餅錢，捐充「義學金」，這樣全市以十萬個求學的小朋友計算，那末不是便有五百萬元龐大的數目嗎？並且這事是很容易辦得到的，大家聽了，都　爲這話很對，當塲紛紛拿出準備省下幾天的大餅錢，湊足一萬三千元，先行奉捐「義學金」我們想全市求學小朋友，果眞能普遍地　　起來，那末一定也能引起社會上一般有力量的人們注意過來，　　解　吧！我們的口號是：「大餅錢，助義學，」「捐助義學，心中快樂！」寗波旅滬同鄕會第一小學五年級全體學王啓」</p>
<p>其三：「本校由校　會創辦於民國三十二年度第二學期，其目的在救濟貧苦失學兒童，授以完全小學敎育，養成優良品性，培植國家公民，學費書費全免，校董會，校長，敎職員和學生間之關係，與普通學校有不同之點，即本校全體有家庭之愛，無　卑之別。本校爲配合校董會有關之施衣·施粥·施診·給藥等救濟工作，特別注重家庭訪問。從訪問中，可以看到學生們家境困難之程度，非一般人所想像。據統計所得，全體學生中以雜糧果腹者佔百分之七十以上，有三餐粥食者，佔百分之二十，二粥一飯者，絕無僅有。每期學生報名，常超過預定學額，因限於經濟，不能儘量容納，引爲憾事。近聞貴報發起創辦議務小學十所，得社會人士贊助，有羣策羣力之全能，不但十所成功可期，並且可以推而廣之，達到初期義敎之完成。本校範圍雖小，其目的刻一，定當追隨於後，時時惕勵，以竟全功。茲特整理　　五百餘冊，奉作義校課本，並捐款一萬三千七百七十五元，均祈查收爲禱。華廣義務學校啓」</p>
<p>其四：我們看到責報要辦義務學校，敎育那些失學的小朋友們，使地們有讀書的機會，我們很感動，很佩服貴報的　心。我們想我們共同生活在一個社　　，　　有互助心。但是我們的力量很小，我們有的只是舊書，此外我們盡力的　　，雖然不過是一點　小的數目，也算盡了我們一份責任·並希望全上海學校的小朋友們，都起來捐助，義務學校將來的前途，是光明燦爛的！附奉中儲券二三九〇〇元，課本四一四冊。比華小學學生上。</p>
<p>其五：我是二乙裏的一個請求本校助學金的學生，這幾天，聽到各位老師說，助人就是助己的話，我就想到我也是人家帮助讀書的一個，假使我沒有各位同學助學金的捐助，我那裏有書讀呢？所以，我對本級各同學說：各位小朋友，我們每天看到各級義學金送到申報館裏去，很希望我們一班的有錢同學，也拿些出來捐助捐助。他們聽到我這幾句話，於是都很熱心地捐出來了。現在共計二萬元，今特送上，請收下。寗波旅滬同鄕會第一小學二乙年級本校助學金生馮珍寶寶啓。</p>
<p>其六：在現在中國社會中，未享受求學的兒童，委實是太多了。拿上海一地說吧，我們每天總可看見，在街頭巷尾，伏着許多流浪的兒童，他們像一羣迷途的羔羊，把黃金般的光陰，任其浪費，眞是可惜，但這也是國家重大的損失呀！所以自貴報館創辦義小，謝立林君發起勸募義學金運動後，各界都已紛紛響應。我們校　各級的同學們，非常熱心，各人把點心錢節省下來，奉捐義學金。我們的一級，爲了這事，更是早已召集一次臨時級會，現在先把捐到的五千一百元，奉捐義學金。這數字雖小，但我們還要盡我們的力量，完遂這個人生應盡的天職，並同時希望全市小朋友，也一致起來響應，那麼我們未來中國的文盲，便可一掃而光了。寗波同鄕會一校六年級全體學生上。</p>
<p>此外國强小學捐小學各科敎科書新舊六百五十五本。光漢小學學生捐二百餘本，智民小學捐一百三十五本，黃月昌小弟弟捐六本，熱心義敎盛情可感。</p>
<p>解決不識字痛苦義校是重要工作</p>
<p>建東印刷公司工友　志年君來函說：「我是一個讀書不多的工人，因爲識字不多，時常　到困難，所以我一看到人家不肯讀書，總是苦苦相勸，免得他們　我一樣受到痛苦。現在看到貴報舉辦義務小學，並且由謝林立先生發起「義學金」運動，覺得在大批失學的時候，正是一件重要的工作。因此我願意在日常開支裏，省下一千元，來做「義學金」，並向同事陸善初·李燕忠·岳疏海三君，各捐五百元·合計國幣二千五百元。雖然數目極少，却也是我一點存心，我曉得上海熱心敎育的人很多，希望他們能拿出更多的錢來，救救一般失學的兒童！」</p>

<p>慶祝國府還都五周紀念特刊</p>
<h3>還都五年來之中國經濟</h3>
<p>— 吳生</p>
<p>國府還都以來，轉瞬已是五年，俗語說：「五年一小變，十年一大變」，在這多事之秋的五年中，中國經濟現狀，亦經變演遞嬗，而大改　觀。但是五年來的經濟大勢，究竟在那一條途徑上走？國府的經濟施策，究竟是怎樣發動及其反響如何？這些問題，雖然事過境遷，都很有回味檢討的價值。</p>
<p>國府還都之時，大局粗定，瘡疾滿目，那時的經濟工作，以復興爲主旨，對內是確立財政，安定民生，對外是中日經濟提携，協力建設。直至民國三十年秋，華中經濟受世界戰局之波動，而開始步入另一階段，就是說不論在金融上及貿易上，對外關係漸形中絕，而不得不開始確立目給經濟。一方面由於英美經濟勢力之衰退，而各種向由英美商人經營之大規模事業漸漸由國人自己來經營，因此像金融業保險業及以前向不經見的投資隻團等都紛紛設立起來，使經濟社會的面目爲之一改；一方面由於輸入物資的減少，及戰爭延長而消費的擴大，使物資供應不能圖滑，於是物價問題就成爲經濟問題之中核。在這種客觀情形今昔不同的條件下，國府爲救治經濟病態定民生起見，就實施種種經濟施策，譬如强化統制，消極的防止經濟擾亂行爲，增加生產，積極的謀經濟現狀的改善，雖然所收效果未見顯著，可是事實上確已樹立了不少汗馬功績。</p>
<p>還都五年來之中國經濟，大致可以分成四五個階段，目還都至三十年十二月大東亞戰爭爆發止，是戰後經濟景氣恢復時期，也可說是經濟安定時期。三十一年新舊法幣脫離關係，金融市塲引起極大騷擾，當時游資泛濫，金融欃關畸開發展，於是財部開始金融機關之積極管理，所以這個時期可以說是幣制整理時期，也可以說是金融動盪時期。三十二年二月三日全國經濟會議決定戰時經濟政策綱領五條，華中經濟應趨途徑，至此才吿確立。所謂經濟統制，從這時起漸入實踐階段，如三月份滬市成立商統會，國府設置物資審議委員會，以及日方公布揚子江地域物資移動取締暫行規則，四月份澈查滬市投機囤積機關，八月份最高國防會議通過收買棉紗布辦法，所以這個時期可以說是物費統制時期。可是當時商品市塲依舊充滿投機囤積氣氛，大家都感到物資在一天天缺乏，並且以爲藏幣不如藏貨，風尙不及，使物資物價問題日趨嚴重，直待政府開始收買棉紗布工作，大勢才吿平定，所以這個時期可稱之爲物資續制時期，亦可稱之爲投機囤積時期。三十三年度劈頭，政府舉增加生產爲施政之重心，慫經濟統制工作困鬥一年來之辛苦經驗中，深深的體味到在我國社會環境之下，單單憑統制一方面的力量是不足以謀經濟工作的圓滑推進和民生問題的合理解決的，必須統制工作與增加生產相輔並行，經濟現狀乃有改善可能。說實在，頻年來物資生產能力實在太薄弱了，運輸問題，燃料電力問題，原料問題，生產成太問題，只有日見其嚴重，關係當局就這一年中針對了現實病狀殫精竭誠同重重障礙肉搏。所可遺憾的，增產問題，牽涉太廣，雖然費了極大心力，還不收到充分的效果，反且工續商各業日見其襄頽，更由於物資生產之減少而必然的引起物價的高漲，一年內發生了四度空前物價漲風，所以三十三年度可命名爲增產年，亦可以命名爲物價年。</p>
<p>還都五周年來，經濟界起了這樣大的變動，而變演的結果是相當不能使人滿意的，從余融動盪時期至投機囤積時期，再從投機囤積時期降而至物價嚴重時期，人民的生活一天比一天艱難，這是現實，這是無可否認的實情。可是民生艱難歸因於經潛狀况之不合理是對的，如果歸咎於當局施策的不當，就未免有失正鵠，試從還都以來我國內在外在所遭遇的種積特殊環境，略加分析，並將五年來之經濟工作與之作一對照，的確對於健全經濟之道已有莫大貢獻，現將其犖犖大者，作一簡單之回憶與槪述。</p>
<p>（一）確立財政與改善金融</p>
<p>財政爲庶政之母，無財就無以舉政，所以民國二十九年國府還都伊始，首先確立財政，由周財長發表的財政方針中，可以窺見當時的財政重點，的有入項；</p>
<p>（一）安定金融，（二）維持公債信用，（三）整理國稅，（四）取消苛捐雜稅，（五）誘導游資，（六）整理貿易，（七）調節民生，（八）援助生產。</p>
<p>戰後國府財政收支內容，由於客觀環境之變遷，較之戰前，已有顯著變動。戰前以關鹽統爲歲收主幹，今則關鹽兩稅地位日下，而不得不賴其他稅收或其他收入來源爲歲入之中堅。據本年三月財政部决畏陳之碩氏發表一年施政概况，三十四年度上半年國家總預算每月爲三十六萬萬元，較之支出，尙不足四萬萬元左右，而有發行公債彌補透支之企圖。「至預算對象，以保障治安爲最要，約占總預算六成以上，其决爲增加生產，再次爲改善待遇。」所謂保障治安，大概就是軍警經費，所謂增加生產，大槪指財政實業建設方面之經費而言。國家總預算每月三十六萬萬元，如考慮到幣值的低下，那麼與戰前國府財政相一比，可見得是何等低下，以這些經費，要做這麼許多的事，我們應當深切領悟到政府的撙節，和政府在怎樣窮絀的財政環境下的苦幹精神。這是五年來政府財政的實狀。</p>
<p>至於金融方面，大東亞戰爭發生後，華中經濟隨國際局勢之銳變而發生質的變化，因此發生兩種現象，一是新舊法幣失掉聯繫價值，一是滬市華洋金融勢力的隆薈。三十一年三月三十日財部怖吿廢止新舊法幣等價交換辦法，五月下旬起開始比例折換，以致於逐步將舊幣淘汰，擴充新法幣流通範圍，停止軍票發行，使華中地區成爲中儲券靑一色的局面，經過了短短的奮鬥時期，畢竟完成了艱巨的工作。</p>
<p>在幣制整理工作進行時期，金融界一時陷於極大混淆，加以游資泛濫作崇，注商經濟活動受大東亞戰事關係而早呈停頓狀態，於是華商銀行錢荘銀號信託公司地產公司保險公司投資公司企業集團等，風起雲湧，乘機活躍，創設之盛，空前絕後，華商金融勢力之自主伸展，要以此時爲最好時機。可是良莠混雜，投機色彩十分濃厚，發展產業金融不足，敗壞經濟市塲之秩序有餘，財部當局有鹽於此，乃於三十一年入月公布管理金融機關暫行辦法，以爲限制。是後一再強化，三十三年秋，財部公布强化上海特別市金融機關業務綱要，對於各行莊業務，再作進一步之嚴密監督，金融市塲雖未能從此正本淸源，而各行莊投機囤積風氣，已經大受挫折</p>
<p>（二）全面實施統制經濟</p>
<p>隨着戰局的持久，自由經濟的運營，到處發生破綻，統制工作應事實的需要而日形吃緊，三十二年二月十二日，全國經濟委員會第一次全體會議通過戰時經濟政策　領五條，十三日由國民政府公布施行，其內容爲：</p>
<p>（一）關於增加生產者</p>
<p>（二）關於調劑物價者</p>
<p>（三）關於節約消費者</p>
<p>（四）關於擬定幣值及調</p>
<p>整余融者</p>
<p>（五）關於改善經濟機構者</p>
<p>所陳範圍非常廣泛，對於經濟活動之各部門，都確立了準確的指導原理，今後戰時經濟工作的推動，均不出該項綱領之規範。</p>
<p>三十二年三月十一國防會議討論戰時物資統制問題，在統制機構方面，決定設置全國商業統制總會，在實施辦法方面，則訂定戰時物資移動取締暫行條例，並由國民政府發表命令：「戰時物資移動取締暫行條例已經公佈，所有淸鄉地區物資移動及擬出入取締規則及其他取一締物資移動之類似規定，除米另有規定外，一切廢止之。「翌日（十二日）國府公布豚浙皖米穀運銷一管理暫行條例，日方陸海軍及大使館會銜公布掦子江地域物資移動取締暫行　規則。從此支離破碎枝枝節節的物資移動取締，除特殊物資外，改爲商統會一元處理的自治統制，十六日商統會成立物資移動許可事務所，四月十七日起接辦物資移動許可事宜</p>
<p>商統會成立以後，在中日關係常局協助之下，續極向自治統制之途邁進，第一步先行着手　組各業聯合會。當初各業別聯保會籌備主任及籌務委員由主管部（糧食或　　）指定，並派監理官監督指各業別聯合會指導監督，辦理統制有關事宜。除各業聯合會及同業公會外。商統會爲謀下層機構的周密管理，對各種重要商業，另組專業委員會（去年商統會改組時改爲統制委員會），以確立完密健全的統制體勢。後來商統會幾經變遷，但是到今日還都五周紀念止，商人自治統制的精神依舊仍在。反覆言之，就是說各地方由各業商人成立同業公會，聯合各地同業公會而成立各業聯合會，一方面各種重要商業方面，由中日關係商人聯合組織商業別專業委員會，其上面是全國商業統制總會。</p>
<p>隨着商業統制總會的成立，國府爲强化物資統制及督促商統會完善運用機能起見，特設置物資統制審議委員會。其任務爲：一，是國民政府對於統制物資的審議機關，一，是關於物資統制中日間的協議聯絡機關。該會成立以後，與商統會互輔而行，一個是實踐機關，一個是審議機關，自此華中經清遂納入統制的範疇。</p>
<p>一方面由商人的自　來自己統治自己，一方面政府對於投機囤積的取締漸取積極的態度，如三十二年四月，汪主席特令澈查滬市投機囤積機關，財實兩部會同澈查行莊承放鉅　押款，滬市經濟局調查倉庫堆存物資，最高國防會議通過囤積商品治罪條例等，猶恐不能收獲充分效果，更於六月十九日在滬成立特資調查委員會，加緊調查取締工作，而棉紗布的強制收買，頓使投機囤積的氣　一時幾頻</p>
<p>（三）增加生產</p>
<p>不過，民生的安定，經濟的健全，端非消極的物資統制所能收效，問題的締結還是在如何增加生產，否則物資囤積雖受取締，物資以外的投經依舊出路多端。統制工作運營得當，可以防止種種經濟矛盾之發生，但是經濟現狀之澈底改善，非配合建設工作是無法達成的，尤其在戰後我國，生產程序尙未恢復，生產進度暹遲於消費數字的後面，對外增加生產以促進物資供應的圓滑，民生的安定很難設法保障。可是增加生產必須具備可以增產的條件，和解除生產障礙的決心，否則是徒託空言，無補實際，如果對排除生產障　已經盡了最大努力而仍舊限於事實困難竟不克收獲增產的實效，這是戰時特殊情菜，也是交戰各國共有的現象。我們惟有過去的努力，重加檢討。是否　當，是否有改善的餘增。</p>
<p>還都五年來的生產，似乎沒有多大的進步：不論農業方面，不論工業方面最近一年內只有日趨養縮和衰退。農業生產的障礙，根據過往經騐，約有五端：一，農村治安不良，二，苛捐雜稅頻繁，日，收買價格不甚合理，四，肥料農具耕牛資本的缺乏，五，農民買不到生活日用品，因此生產意欲不够興奮。工業生產的障礙，亦有下列　端：一，原料缺乏，二，電力煤斤供應遺減，三，運輸困難，四，生產成本浩大而收買價格有時不甚合理，五，有比較生產更便利更簡捷的發財途徑。</p>
<p>由於生產的未能十分順利推展，物價問題隨之日形嚴重，爲了解決高物價的癥結和改善困　的民生，我們希望生產問題能够迅速轉機。最近負責農業增產的行政院農業增產策進委員會發表民國三十四年度農業增產工作，對於逐月增產工作，有周密計畫，這是根據過去痛苦經騐，進一步針對生產障礙發動農業增產實際工作的表示。同時滬市工業疏散問題以及煤斤運輸問題。最近莫不呈露好轉曙光，工業生產可以說已經脫離了最惡塲面而達上更生的道路。</p>
<p>五年來的生產情形雖並無多大生色，第六年起的增加生產已擁有的希望和絕大的可能，只要我們不斷努力，經濟前途充滿着光明，未來的一切，請拭目以看吧。</p>
<h3>市宣傳處發表告民衆書</h3>
<p>市宣傳處發表「國府還都五周年紀念吿本市民衆書」原文如下；</p>
<p>國民政府自從民國二十九年三月三十日還都以來，到現在巳經是整整的五個年頭了。國府還都最主要的目的和最重大的意義是對內求和平統一，對外爭取獨立目由，經過五年的努力，全面和平雖然還沒有實現，但我們已經有了寳貴的收獲，內政上無論政治的建設，經濟的復興，都有相當成就，外交上則收囘租界撤廢治外法權，國</p>
<p>自從前年一月九日參戰以後，我國即與盟邦日本共同擔負保衛東亞的使命，一致對英美奮戰，實現了團父所提倡的大亞洲主義，與聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥的遺志。因爲亞洲之中，有帝國主義之存在，和平必不能實現，所以我們不但要求統一和平的實現，而且要求全東亞的眞正和平，達到民族解放獨立自由之目的。</p>
<p>在這國府還都五周年的今天，大東亞戰爭巳進入了決戰的陪段，我們今後的責任自然也愈益重大。可是最不幸的，在故主席又離開我們而去，當這東亞各民族競圖生存的時候，也就是我們爭取獨立自由，獲得了實現的良機，我們應當把握住這個寳貴的機會，爲了中國，爲了東亞，也爲追悼在故主席，不能因循，不能疏忽，貢默一切於國家，早日完成國府還都的偉大任務。</p>
<p>現在陳代主席爲黨國元老，繼續領導全國民衆從事舊鬥，我們更應堅定信念，認淸一個主義，在陳代主席領導之下，遵行汪故主席所訓示的三大國策。</p>
<p>第一，真正思想，每一市民必須要蕩滌腐敗的思想，消減個人主義，共同一致，向前邁進，根本剷除社會的惡習，棄用底加強國家的力量，實現國家集團主義。</p>
<p>第二，確保治安，這一點雖然軍警的責任較爲重大，但人民必須要隨時隨地與軍警打成一片，集結全力，使得治安可以確立，民衆才能安居樂業。</p>
<p>第三，增加生產，在戰爭時戎中物資缺乏是任何國家所必然的現象，政府雖然盡最大的努力，實行增產運動，抑平物價，安定民生，但每一國發都有一般的責任。我們不但要在積極方面協助政府增加生產，而且要在消森方面，節約消費，勤儉自勵，貢獻國家，增強載力。</p>
<p>我們於慶祝國府還都五周年紀念的今天，必須要澈底認清時局，刻苦耐勞，愈益奮發，協力盟邦，完遂載爭，掃清英美侵略勢力。貫澈和平反共建國的國策以與復中華，爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，以保衛東亞。</p>

<h3>還都五年前的今日</h3>
<p>日歷上揭到民國古十四年三月三十日，一幅慶祝國府還都五週年紀念的畫面又呈現限前。</p>
<p>五年斷不是一個悠長的時間，置身於世界風雲動蕩中的人，也許真要感到時間飛躍太速了，可是，每試一回想五年前，汪故主席　始和運艱辛締情形，戰後中國滿目蓬蒿瘡痍未復的創痕，回顧五年來推展和運的過程……這一幕幕的光景，又恍如昨日的事。</p>
<p>五年，短暫的五年，中國已從頽垣斷壁中開拓出新的山河，中日兩大民族由諒解提携進而結成駢肩作戰的盟友……這就是新中國歷史上最輝煌燦爛的一天。</p>
<p>首都　五年前的今日，民國二十九年三月三十日，首都南京重新飄揚起青天白日的國旗</p>
<p>一個初春的上午八時，汪故主席奕奕的神采出現於南京國民政府大禮堂，這時正舉行一個荘嚴肅穆的還都典禮</p>
<p>「本善隣友好，共同防共，經清提携之原則，與友邦日本共同努力，確立親善關係，實現東亞和平，革除過去獨裁政治，籌劃召開國民大會……」汪故主席以鏗鏘的音調朗育這具有歷史性的還都宣言的一節，一字一名使列席的文武官員都在肅靜空氣中洗耳恭聽聆，把視綫都集中到台上，各人心坎上熱烈的情緒，已在這一刹那間迸出了。</p>
<p>下午，中山北路上遠遠傳來陣陣雄壯的軍樂馨，大羣靑少年行列，踏出整齊的步伐，遙向中央大學進發，這就是參加慶祝還都大會操的行列蜒蜿的隊伍，象徵着這一股新生的洪流，已開始澎湃激盪，祖國此刻正爲他們張開慈祥的雙手。</p>
<p>別方面，那曾經作爲中政會議塲的國際俱樂部，這時復舉行慶祝還都的歡迎外賓大會，汪故主蒿對着各國貴賓歡談，面上露出絲絲的笑容，從脫出河內到今天的還都，他已寫出一首悲的詩篇，後來舉杯祝賀來賓健康時，融洽的空氣，散佈到會塲內每一角落。</p>
<p>上海　離首都咫尺的上海，是日外灘江海關的　樓上，也同時換上了揭　和平反共建國的青天白日旗　，迎風招展，閘北市府大厦前，高懸着　巨幅紅布橫額，綴上「上海市各界民衆聯合慶祝國府還都典禮」的連串金字，一片嘹喨的歡呼聲，也就是大部份國民的謳歌，現時他們能够幸福地站上這塊和平的國土，所以衷心的愉悅，是應該清晰地形諸面上的，試看：政務委員會成立的民衆，已超過十七萬人，佔全市人口的十分之三，這是故都已賦有新生命新活力的明證。也足以反映出華北民衆又是如何熱烈地擁護統一的國民政府，尤其使人與奮的，大街小巷中青天白日旗交相輝映，真是一個感人至深的印象。</p>
<p>漢口　在和平地區前哨的漢口，中山公園內正在舉行具有同一意義的慶祝大會，那大羣刧後歸來的武漢市民，當他們一看見會塲上顧着巨幅的領袖肖像時，不期然地便會追憶到當日領袖脫險河內發表艷　的崇高精神，再看到這一片戳後的集土，全國領袖赴湯蹈火的行徑方能將他們從危阽中拯救出來，愈見領袖的鹽功偉績，實與天地伺垂不朽。</p>
<p>這一天，舉國騰歡的聲浪，何祇傳遍華北華中，且已響澈華南：在廣州，這南中國的重鎮，已披上新生外衣，面迎此一偉大的節日，這天晚上所舉行的民衆提燈火炬大遊行，那繽紛的燈綵，耀目的火炬，交織成一幅絢麗的圖案。繼而激昂的軍歌，在每個遊行健兒的口中唱出，馬路兩旁觀衆電動的歡呼聲，構成了這如火如茶的一幕，可見中國的光明大道，就已在火光中湧現出來。</p>
<p>轉瞬五年了，這連串的景色縈迴腦際，撫今追昔，愈增　奮。</p>
<p>五年以來，每年度舉國騰歡的聲浪，響澈雲霄。前年，我們已進一步毅然與盟邦日本踏上捍衛大東亞的征途，舉國的騰歡聲，一變而爲同仇敵愾情緒；去年，國人含淚痛失領袖，由陳代主席領導邁進，可見在一樣的　呼聲中而愈見責任是逐步加重。</p>
<p>五年後的今日，尤其在目前決戰階段中欣逢此日重臨，過去　歡的塲面，便是給予我們以勇氣，和平，光明，幸福的一面最明晰的鏡子，我們隨時要珍重的拂拭，別　這明朗的印象磨減！（中央社）</p>

<h3>Content of Two Important Cases Passed</h3>
<p>As a result of thorough discussion of all the proposals, essential and concrete resolutions have been passed and are currently being actively compiled by the conference secretariat. Once the compilation is complete, it will be formally announced. The most important of these include the following two cases:</p>
<h3>Inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Legacy and Complete the National Revolution</h3>
<p>(1) "Launch a unified national salvation movement, inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, and complete the national revolution."</p>
<p>Reason: Since the Xinhai Revolution, China has been plagued by internal and external troubles, and has failed to advance as a modern nation. After the Sino-Japanese War, with the evolution of international relations, the domestic situation has become increasingly divided, the country fragmented, and the people displaced. The autonomy, independence, equality, and freedom that the entire nation yearns for, are nowhere in sight. Although the reasons for this are complex, the greatest obstacles to the development of our nation are no more than the aggression of capitalist imperialism, the disputes of party separatism, and the disruption of communist forces. These three factors are intertwined, creating a cycle of misfortune, and thus contributing to China's past decline and current predicament.</p>
<p>Therefore, to save the country today, we must first understand the source of the chaos and start with anti-aggression, anti-separatism, and anti-communism. To achieve success in these three areas, there is no other way but to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and complete the national revolution. Only by completing the national revolution can we resist the aggression of capitalist imperialism and free Chinese society from its semi-colonial and semi-feudal character. Only by completing the national revolution can we eliminate the disputes of party separatism and build a revolutionary and powerful political system. And only by completing the national revolution can we curb the growth of communist ideas and prevent the spread of communist forces.</p>
<p>Since completing the national revolution is the only correct path to save China, all compatriots across the country should take this as their goal and unite their efforts. All those who in the past have been bound by party concepts, stages, ideological awareness, and regional prejudices, should abandon them all, and under the supreme principle of the nation and the country, launch a unified national salvation movement, form a unified national salvation front, unite sincerely, and work together for the national revolution. Through the unity of the people, we can form the unity of political forces, the unification of thought and doctrine, and promote the unification of action and steps. Only then can we build a modern nation and strive for the independence, autonomy, equality, and freedom of the nation and the country. Therefore, we propose launching a unified national salvation movement and, at the same time, determining the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle for the unified national salvation strategy, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, seeking the unification of national ideals, and then completing the national organization to seek the unity of national strength, and eliminating the obstacles to the nation and the country to seek the success of the national revolution. The situation is serious, and the national crisis is intensifying. The end of the war may not be the solution to China's problems. The people should be aware, unite, and strive for the permanent survival of the nation and the country. Is this appropriate? Please decide.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Explains the Battle Situation in Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands: Will Cause Greater Bleeding to the Enemy</h3>
<p>The regular meeting of the Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China was held yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and many reporters attended. Minister Matsushima gave a detailed account of the Pacific war situation and the battle of the Ryukyu Islands, which will cause greater bleeding to the enemy. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands Attack Targets</p>
<p>The U.S. Fifth Fleet is currently targeting Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands for attack. About a hundred ships are concentrated in this area. Some battleships and cruisers are shelling Okinawa Island, while other forces are landing on the Kerama Islands. B-29 bombers from the Mariana Islands are carrying out long-range bombing, and aircraft from the Fifth Fleet's 58th Task Force are attacking key areas in Kyushu, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines. Therefore, the battle situation in the Nansei Islands is becoming increasingly fierce. Since occupying Iwo Jima, the enemy has been targeting the Nansei Islands. Now their plan has gone from words to reality.</p>
<p>Enemy American Forces Are Weaker</p>
<p>The enemy's operational plan was decided at the Washington strategy conference and began on March 17 with the attack on Kyushu by their mobile force. Now they are preparing for the landing. The characteristics of this American operation are: (1) The enemy's forces are smaller than in the past. According to prisoners, the enemy suffered unexpectedly heavy losses during the attack on Kyushu. Therefore, it is expected that their forces will be much weaker than in the battles of Panay and the Philippines. (2) The enemy's preparations are very slow. The enemy's main transport force has not yet arrived in Okinawa. (3) The quality of the soldiers is poor, and the composition is uneven. The American army has found toothless old men over sixty years old, because the enemy suffered too much loss of human resources in past operations, and there are not enough manpower, so this phenomenon occurred. On the contrary, the Japanese army is in a favorable terrain, and the counterattack is very thorough, giving the enemy a heavy blow. As the Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 28th, 31 enemy battleships and cruisers were sunk near Okinawa, and the enemy's loss of force reached one-third of the total.</p>
<p>The War Will Be More Intense and Cruel</p>
<p>According to a United Press International dispatch from New York on the 21st, the attack on Ryukyu Island may be easier than Iwo Jima. This is the American view. Whether it is easy or not will be shown in the actual battle. Strategically, Ryukyu Island is different from Iwo Jima and Saipan. Ryukyu's position is a neutral zone in the defense of both China and Japan. Whether departing from Kyushu, Taiwan, or China, operations can be effective. Therefore, the battle between Japan and the United States in Ryukyu will be an intense and cruel battle. Now I will elaborate on the past achievements of Britain and the United States in operations and their forces:</p>
<p>Will Cause Greater Bleeding to the Enemy</p>
<p>In June last year, Britain and the United States used 124,000 soldiers and 3,495 ships of all sizes in the Normandy landings in Europe. In the Iwo Jima landings, the U.S. Marine Corps used 60,000 soldiers and 800 ships. The total number of soldiers was 220,000. In the Lingayen landings in the Philippines, the U.S. used 150,000 soldiers and 1,033 ships in the first four days, and the number of soldiers assisting was 273,000. We can learn from previous battles how many troops the Americans need to operate in the Pacific? From this, we can imagine how much different is the force they are preparing now from the Battle of Iwo Jima? The terrain of Ryukyu Island is a fragmented mountainous area, so it is not easy to build airfields on the island. The climate is extremely hot, and water is scarce. At this time of year, there are many poisonous snakes. (Minister Matsushima recalled that when he was a Navy Lieutenant at the age of 24, he went to Ryukyu Island and saw that the snake skin was used as a drum on the local sanshin, so we can imagine how many snakes are there.) Therefore, we are convinced that this Ryukyu battle will cause the enemy greater bleeding than the battles of Saipan and Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>Refuting the Enemy's False Propaganda</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Matsushima said that recently, the United States' propaganda has been extremely chaotic. For example, the Nimitz Command announced that 17 or 18 Japanese ships had been destroyed in the Seto Inland Sea of Kyushu since March 17, which is not true. If it were as the American side reported, then at least the names, styles, sizes, and tonnage of the ships would be described in more detail. At the same time, the figures of Japanese damage released by San Francisco or New Delhi are different. The enemy often uses the habitual trick of "according to Japanese reports" in propaganda, hoping to increase the Chinese and even the Japanese people's belief in their news. Therefore, news that is not available in Japanese reports can often be seen in their inaccurate reports.</p>
<p>Measures</p>
<p>(1) Use the proposition of unified national salvation as the center of the declaration of this conference. (2) Use Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as the guiding principle of the unified national salvation movement. (3) Telegraph the country and overseas compatriots to clarify the proposition of unified national salvation, asking them to rise up together, jointly plan the process, and unite all parties, factions, regions, and circles to form a unified national salvation alliance.</p>
<h3>Guarantee Freedom of Speech and Establish Public Opinion Institutions</h3>
<p>(2) "Request the government to guarantee the people's freedom of speech and assembly and adopt the public opinion institution plan."</p>
<p>Reason: The active purpose of politics is to seek the survival and happiness of the people. There is politics only when there are people, and there is no government without people. This is a definite and easy principle. Therefore, today, both internally and externally, we must unite the total power of the people and go to the government together to overcome the difficulties and deal with the difficult situation. Therefore, adopting public opinion is even more important than peacetime. We must allow the situation below to reach above, and then the government can use it as a wise policy. We must allow the intentions above to be declared below, and then the people can rely on it for proper cooperation. The government should provide possible relief for the suffering of the people, and the people should have a full understanding of the difficulties of the government. We should overcome difficulties with each other, negotiate in good faith, unite officials and people, unite above and below, and then we can establish a strong and innovative system. In the past few years, joint consultation meetings at all levels have been held in the north, cooperating with administrative institutions at all levels, where officials and people gathered together to discuss all issues in order to seek political innovation and administrative promotion, which has been quite effective. The late Chairman Wang personally attended the training and gave encouragement. This method seems to be universally promoted throughout the country to establish public opinion institutions. The situation is urgent. To complete the great cause of internal recovery and external liberation, the people of the country should unite sincerely and fight together. The government and the people should take the same steps and overcome difficulties together. Therefore, I propose that the government guarantee the people's freedom of speech and assembly, adopt public opinion, and establish public opinion institutions. Is this appropriate? Please decide.</p>
<p>Measures</p>
<p>(1) Please ask the government to promulgate an order guaranteeing the people's freedom of speech and assembly. (2) Please ask the conference to require the government to unify the structure of the people's movement and actively strengthen and develop a broad and in-depth people's movement. (3) The public opinion institution should be named the Council at all levels. (4) The Council should be set up in cooperation with the current administrative institutions at all levels. A National Council should be set up in the central government, and Local Councils should be set up in various places. (5) The Council should be composed of representatives elected by the people. The term of office of the representatives should be one year. (6) The session of the Council at all levels should be held once a year, and extraordinary meetings should be convened when necessary. (7) When the Council at all levels meets, the administrative heads at all levels must attend the meeting to explain and answer questions. (8) The government should issue and implement the organizational regulations of the Council at all levels.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Martyrs, Ceremony Grand</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 29th was the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs. The National Government solemnly held a memorial ceremony at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the National Government to commemorate the merits and great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs who devoted themselves to the National Revolution during their lifetime. More than 300 civil and military officials from all departments, ministries, and offices of the National Government, including Acting Chairman Chen, participated. The atmosphere in the auditorium was solemn and reverent, and the ceremony was conducted in a mourning atmosphere. At 9:00 AM, Acting Chairman Chen, wearing a black national dress, arrived amidst the loud sounds of military music, with everyone standing solemnly to welcome him. The ceremony began in the sound of music. After the Chairman took his seat, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem, and paid the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Then, the Chairman respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, and everyone paid respect to the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs, and observed a moment of silence. After the silence, the Chairman offered flowers to the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs in the sound of funeral music, and the ceremony ended.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Prepares Fully, Abolishes Conscription Restrictions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Army, in order to fully prepare for the final battle on the mainland, has revised the Army Recruitment Rules. The regional restrictions on conscription inspections and the call-up of young and strong soldiers over the age of seventeen, which were previously only applicable to the battlefield, will be abolished.

<h3>Wang Yintai Applauded for Meritorious Service, Awarded Special Class Tongguang Medal, National Government Issued Order Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Wang Yintai, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, has made outstanding contributions to the overall plan. The National Government issued an order on the fifth anniversary of the return to the capital, awarding him the Special Class Tongguang Medal to recognize his meritorious service. The government order is as follows: National Government Order, March 29, 34th year of the Republic of China, Wang Yintai is awarded the Special Class Tongguang Medal. This order, Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Today is the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Five years ago, the late Chairman Wang led and coordinated, without fear of hardship and danger. For five years, he struggled hard, and it can be said that there was no day that he was not in a tense situation. And in this year, unfortunately, Chairman Wang died of overwork and illness, and failed to see the completion of coordination. We express our infinite respect on the occasion of celebrating the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital today.</p>
<p>In the past, on the third and fourth anniversaries of the National Government's return to the capital, we wrote articles to celebrate and express our expectations. Today, we review the progress of national affairs over the past year and look around at the current internal and external situation. We deeply feel that the various issues that we eagerly expected in the past are still the issues that should be raised today.</p>
<p>First, the problem of improving people's livelihood. On this day two or three years ago, we proposed: "For the benefits of the country and the people, the problems that the Chongqing side cannot solve, mainly such as food problems, price problems, corruption problems, and all problems related to improving people's lives, we hope that the Nanjing National Government must have the power and the way to seek a thorough solution. At the same time, the National Government will never repeat the mistakes that the Chongqing side has said and done and has failed." Since Acting Chairman Chen took charge of the Central Government, he first took clarifying officialdom and eliminating corruption as a prerequisite for administration. The problem of corruption has finally been rectified to a certain extent. As for the price problem, the Fair Price Maintenance Committee was first organized in the capital, and the crackdown on hoarding and manipulation was quite effective. The fair price work in this city has been effectively promoted, and the wind of speculation and price increases has also been restrained. The fair price measures in Nanjing and Shanghai will naturally play a leading role. However, the food problem is at the center of the price problem. If this problem is not solved, all fair price work will inevitably be counterproductive. Therefore, we hope that in the future, we will focus all our efforts on solving the food problem in order to truly improve people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Second, the problem of political innovation. Our premise for advocating political innovation is to establish expert politics and establish public opinion institutions. Expert politics means using people according to their talents and abilities, on the one hand, eliminating corruption and eliminating redundant officials. So that a new spirit is formed in politics and efficiency is increased. In this year, the government has paid attention to adjusting personnel, but it is necessary to further employ new talents. Secondly, in order to communicate the opinions of officials and people, so that officials and people can work together, it is necessary to establish public opinion institutions. The People's Representatives Conference of various provinces and cities currently being held in the capital can be said to be the beginning of the communication of public opinion, but we hope to further promote the establishment of real public opinion institutions, so that public opinion has the opportunity to be expressed regularly.</p>
<p>Third, the current Great East Asia War situation is moving towards a decisive battle. As we said yesterday, whether the enemy attempts to fight on the Japanese mainland or on the Chinese mainland, the military and civilians of China and Japan should rise up to fight as one. Only with a more united force can we deal with stubborn enemies. And the current military and political deployment of the Allies, we can see that they are all taking the seizure of time, rapid and practical as the only conditions. All our measures must also be rapid to seize time, cherish it, and not indulge in empty talk.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen said in his speech to the People's Representatives Conference of various provinces and cities a few days ago: "The pain of the country and the nation can only be relieved by the efforts of the people of the country. The personal pain of the people of the country can only be relieved after the pain of the country and the nation is relieved." We should make every effort to relieve the pain of the country and the nation under the leadership of the government. But at the same time, we cannot ignore reducing the unnecessary pain of the people, which is enough to strengthen the efforts of the people to contribute to the government.</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Continues Attacks, Sinking 30 Enemy Vessels Using Soviet Ships; Japanese Naval Forces Achieve Results in Surprise Attack</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 29th: The Japanese Air Force continues to attack the enemy invading forces around Okinawa Island. From March 26th to 28th, the confirmed results are as follows: One battleship sunk, six cruisers sunk, one cruiser or destroyer sunk, seven destroyers sunk, one minesweeper sunk, nine battleships or cruisers damaged, three destroyers damaged, and two transport ships damaged.</p>
<p>A Certain Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy's mobile units in the Okinawa area are still continuing to move recklessly. The Japanese army is also continuing its fierce attacks. On the 28th, due to bad weather, air combat was almost halted. The enemy mobile units are still continuing naval bombardment of Ie Island and the southern part of Okinawa Island. On the night of the 27th, Japanese naval forces attempted a surprise attack, sinking two enemy cruisers, damaging a destroyer, and sinking one minesweeper.</p>
<p>Enemy Plans to Invade Ryukyu Island</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Around 4:40 PM on the 28th, approximately 80-90 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the southeastern part of Kyushu. A group of 70-80 carrier-based aircraft attacked Miyazaki Prefecture, and another ten attacked Kagoshima. Enemy forces landed a portion of their troops on the Kerama Islands, while simultaneously continuing bombardment of Ryukyu Island, attempting to land on the island. However, they were met with continuous strong attacks by the Japanese Air Force. In order to cut off communications behind Okinawa, the enemy again mobilized its mobile units northward. The main objective of the enemy's actions is to attack the main Japanese airfields in southeastern Kyushu and to launch an air annihilation battle. On the 28th, B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base flew to Korea, Kyushu, the Seto Inland Sea area, and the Kanto region six times, to scout for Japanese Air Force movements. Based on these facts, it can be seen that the enemy's invasion operation against Ryukyu Island is imminent.</p>
<h3>U.S. Invasion of Southwestern Islands is Purely Strategic</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy U.S. Marines are using their full strength, appearing in the seas near the southwestern islands of Japan. On the 25th, a portion of their forces landed on the Kerama Islands, about 20 kilometers west of Okinawa Island. Based on the concentration of enemy land and sea forces in the southwestern islands and the tenacity of their current strategy, it is undoubtedly assumed that the enemy U.S. is attempting to land on Okinawa Island. The southwestern islands are 650 kilometers from Kyushu and 600 kilometers from Taiwan, located in the center of the Japanese strategic base between Kyushu and Taiwan, forming a typical strategic indentation. This attack by the enemy U.S. is a risky move to break into the heart of the Japanese strong quadrilateral defense. Under the courageous attacks of the Japanese air force on both flanks, the enemy fleet will suffer significant damage. Due to this strenuous operation by the enemy U.S., the recklessness of the United States' own strategy can be seen. However, they have to forcefully advance the war. The main purpose of the enemy U.S. attack on the southwestern islands is to rely on strong air force bases to suppress the encirclement of Japan by air and strengthen the strategic bombing to destroy the source of Japanese operations. At the same time, they also plan to use the air power in the area to threaten the transportation arteries of China, Japan, Manchuria, and the southern region, in order to further advance the war against Japan. In addition to this purely strategic intention, it also contains opportunistic operations with political intentions, which is evident in the facts. The purpose of the San Francisco Conference on April 25th is to use post-war international settlements as the core of the conference. Judging from the current situation of the Pacific war, although the encirclement of Japan has been suppressed to a certain extent, it cannot be said that the advantage in the war against Japan has been determined. Since last spring, the Japanese army has inflicted heavy damage on the Chongqing army through continuous preemptive attacks on the mainland front. After the continental north-south route was opened, it formed a strategic zone with favorable connections to the south. After eliminating the hostile elements in French Indochina, the Japanese forces connecting mainland China and the southern region have become increasingly solid. In addition, the enemy's losses on Luzon Island and the recent injuries suffered on Iwo Jima have actually reached 73% of the landing force. This statistic is the highest record in the Pacific war zone. From this, the number of casualties that the U.S. military will face when approaching the Japanese mainland in the future can be imagined. As such, the future of the Pacific War cannot be underestimated, and the facts propagated by the United States cannot be believed. This is a profound impression shared by all countries in the world. The American people deeply admire the spirit of "human bullet attacks" of the 100 million Japanese people. The damage caused by the U.S. military gathering its total strength to attack the Japanese mainland will be even more severe. Japan is terrified, and what facts will the enemy U.S. use to break the international and domestic uneasy atmosphere? As mentioned above, the rapid offensive against the southwestern islands is a purely strategic intention.</p>
<h3>"Japan Political Society" to be Established Today; Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association to Dissolve Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The long-planned new Japanese political association, the "Great Japan Political Society," has decided to elect General Kazushige Ugaki as its president. As all preparatory work has been completed, the inaugural meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 30th at the Central Cafeteria in the House of Representatives. Admiral Koiso Kuniaki and all appointees will attend. After the ceremonial rites, the chairman will be elected, and the progress of the preparatory committee, the name of the association, and the declaration of principles will be reported. Then, General Ugaki will be nominated as president, and President Ugaki will deliver a speech. Subsequently, the dissolution ceremony of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association will be announced, followed by a speech by President Koiso and a thank-you speech by Mr. Takao Gōdō, a representative of all members. Finally, the association will be dissolved.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Air Raid Kyushu, Suffers Japanese Counterattack</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Around 4:40 PM on the 28th, approximately 130 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked air bases in southeastern and southern Kyushu. They were met with a Japanese counterattack, and the Japanese suffered almost no damage. The enemy's purpose for the attack seemed to be a reconnaissance in force.</p>
<p>Continental Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy B-29 aircraft that continue to raid northern Kyushu depart from the Mariana Islands base. In the past, most of the enemy aircraft responsible for air raids on Kyushu were B-29s from deep within the mainland. Recently, these aircraft have been moved to the Mariana Islands, and the enemy U.S. is acutely aware of the difficulties in long-distance supply, which is worthy of attention. The continental supply route, which stretches across the Atlantic, Arabia, Africa, and India, makes even the enemy U.S., with its abundant supplies, feel inadequate. In order to reduce the labor of fuel consumption for supplying the B-29s and to replenish the B-29s at the Mariana Islands base, most of the B-29s concentrated in the Calcutta base group in India have been moved to the Mariana Islands to undertake the mission of air raiding Kyushu. The above facts prove that the Japanese air power on the mainland has been exceptionally strong since last spring. At the same time, when air raiding the Japanese mainland, they are often subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft from the mainland.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack East of Manila; Right Wing Has Broken Into San Mateo</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The battle situation on the right wing of the stronghold east of Manila is still dominated by the Japanese forces due to their brave counterattacks. After repelling the enemy forces that invaded their positions, the right-wing Japanese units broke into San Mateo, an important stronghold for capturing heat. On the night of the 23rd, after annihilating the remaining enemy forces, they fortified the area. Therefore, Japanese military units shelled the enemy's concentration points and camp areas near San Mateo, setting them on fire, and launched a heroic assault. The fire that broke out near the Kuji-O neighborhood on the outskirts of Manila was particularly fierce, and enemy ammunition caught fire and exploded. That night, more than forty enemy tank units near Marikina Peninsula also retreated south in panic. The Japanese forces in this area continued their counterattacks on the 24th and 25th, and the right-wing Japanese units attacked the enemy west of San Mateo. At the same time, they also sent a portion of their forces south, breaking into Marikina. On the night of the 25th, they posed a significant threat to the enemy's rear communication line in the Mecaiya area. Another team broke through the battle line and advanced towards the Majile camp. That night, several large explosions occurred in the camp area. However, the enemy continued its stubborn attacks on the central Japanese position and stepped up pressure on the Japanese left wing with a new division reinforced from the south. Fierce positional attacks have been launched in the area east of Antipolo for several days, but the battle line has not changed much so far.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Zamboanga Claim War Results</h3>
<p>Philippine Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - From the enemy's landing in Zamboanga to the 25th, the main war results achieved by the Japanese army and navy units defending the area over 16 days are as follows: Approximately 5,500 personnel killed or wounded, 49 tanks abandoned and destroyed, 13 armored vehicles destroyed, 33 vehicles destroyed, 9 artillery pieces destroyed or burned, 13 machine guns destroyed, one aircraft hangar destroyed, nine barracks destroyed, 300 gasoline tanks destroyed, and multiple ammunition and food depots destroyed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb, Japan Severely Protests</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese government, regarding the indiscriminate bombing of Naha, Okinawa Island, by enemy mobile units on October 10th last year, urged the U.S. government to pay attention and, based on humanitarian principles and international law, lodged a severe protest against the brutal act of killing innocent civilians. However, no reply has been received to date. Moreover, when B-29 aircraft bombed the mainland, they deliberately concentrated on bombing non-military targets, especially on February 25th, March 10th, 14th, and 17th, when they indiscriminately bombed Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, and other places. The Japanese government, regarding the cruelty that has been repeatedly urged to pay attention to but has not yet been reflected, reserves the right to protest and the freedom to act, and is questioning the responsibility of the U.S. government. The U.S. is completely violating human principles and international regulations today, and its repeated public implementation of indiscriminate bombing is infuriating.</p>
<h3>Germany Decides Not to Seek Peace, Berlin Officials Refute Rumors Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency: Since the rumor that Ambassador Höörl, the German Economic Director of the Foreign Ministry, was probing for peace in Stockholm, the German Foreign Ministry has issued a statement stating that Mr. Höörl's trip was to negotiate technical issues related to German-Swedish economic relations and had no other mission. The spokesman solemnly stated that Germany has never taken any steps to probe for peace and will never beg for peace in the future.</p>
<h3>U.S. Forces Make Fan-Shaped Advance Downstream of the Rhine; Battles Especially Fierce on the Banks of the Main River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency: The pressure on both sides of the battle downstream of the Rhine is equal. However, the U.S. First Army continues to advance in a fan-shaped manner to the east and southeast at the point of penetration in the Westerwald, with the left wing reaching Hachenburg in the Upper Sieg Valley area. The remaining two enemy routes were blocked by the German army after reaching the Dillenburg-Wetzlar line. The target of these two enemy routes is the Thuringen region, so their actions are quite noteworthy. Another part of the enemy forces is advancing south, passing through Bad Ems, attempting to outflank the back of the German Rhine defense line. In the Frankfurt area, after the U.S. Third Army crossed the Main River, more enemy forces crossed the Nors highway to respond. There are fierce battles for the Frankfurt train station. There has been little development in the Hanau area.</p>
<h3>The British are Tired of War</h3>
<p>An American special correspondent recently commented on the situation in London: "There is no place in the world as deeply immersed in misfortune and despair as London. The British are completely tired of the war." Combining information from London, this may not be an exaggeration. In his report on the Crimean Conference, Churchill emphasized the brightness of the future to encourage the sluggish morale of the public. In reality, the situation in Britain can be said to be worse than the outside world imagines. After interviewing an "international affairs expert" who had just returned from London, the reporter felt even more deeply. He stayed in London for three months due to quasi-official matters, and interacted with the British authorities, so he is a person familiar with the situation in Britain. His observations are quite worthy of respect. The main points of his conversation are introduced below.</p>
<p>British newspapers are now striving to promote that Germany is about to collapse, and Churchill is also in line with this propaganda in his speech to Parliament, describing his hopeful observations. But in essence, this propaganda is nothing more than an attempt by British war leaders to alleviate the mental suffering of the British people. In other words, it is just a political stimulant to instigate the British people to support it for one minute and one second longer than Germany. There are many reasons why the British are tired of the war. The fundamental reason is that the so-called privileged class, which manipulated the government and was the true guiding class of Britain in the many wars before today, has now lost its war purpose. This can be clearly seen from Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union. In the British mind, it is good that the Soviet Union is fighting the German fighting force, but beyond this, it is worrying. If the Soviet Union does more than this, the British will worry about the Soviet Union after the war. For the British Empire, with its privileged class as its center, if it falls from the world throne into a vortex of political and social chaos, this is certainly not what the British want. They know that it is difficult to defeat Germany without the assistance of the Soviet Union, so they cannot do without their ally, the Soviet Union. However, they dare not imagine that the Soviet Union can become a political and social victor after the war, and in fact their political intuition makes them have to believe this. This is the doubt, stupor, and stagnation that is lurking in London political circles. This is also the reason why politicians, diplomats, and writers are emphasizing that Britain must also achieve victory in the peace war.</p>
<p>When it comes to who is the victor in the peace war, the first is the Soviet Union, and the second is the United States. Regarding the Crimean Conference, Labour leader Greenwood lamented: "It is a great pity that all major international conferences are held outside of Britain. Today, among the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Britain seems to be relegated to third place." His sigh may be directed at the privileged class, not at the working class, because it is irrelevant to the working class that the Soviet Union surpasses Germany, surpasses Britain, or surpasses the whole world.</p>
<p>Another opponent is the United States. Britain has been forced to provide many bases of the British Empire to the United States due to the necessity of war. People who pride themselves on owning an "empire" are naturally unhappy when another country with ambitions to build an "empire" appears. In the depths of the British hearts, the Americans are constantly climbing up in the direction of the Atlantic. Their upward climb, when the time comes, turns into the ambition to build an empire, demanding to cede the position of protector of the weak countries under British hegemony, which is naturally very embarrassing for Britain. There is also one more thing that scares Britain even more, and that is not the territorial aggression of the United States but its spiritual aggression. The American soldiers stationed in Britain are paid ten times more than the British soldiers, which makes it easy to win the favor of British women, even causing them to become pregnant. Today, many British girls around the age of fourteen have given birth to illegitimate children. This is a shocking fact. Anyone who has been to a British colony knows that the British extremely respect their women, and they are very unhappy when there is a conflict with the local natives. However, today, for the sake of the American soldiers who have run to the heart of the British Empire, British women, even upper-class ladies, are gradually becoming prey for others.</p>
<p>While Britain is being threatened by other countries as described above, Germany's V-1 and V-2 continue to attack the British Isles, causing them to suffer an average loss of one out of three houses being destroyed. The shock of the British is truly beyond imagination. Even if the damage to military supplies is not significant, the mental blow is enormous. This kind of terrible thing that has no sound and flies faster than sound can suddenly descend from the sky while walking, sleeping, or eating. For example, taking my own experience as an example, one night when I had just lain down on the bed and was dozing off, I was suddenly thrown onto a tree in the yard. I didn't know what had happened in an instant, but fortunately I was not seriously injured. The possibility of this kind of flying misfortune makes people uneasy. The nerves of London citizens are understandably fatigued. Churchill's loud propaganda that the war is about to end is also for this reason.

<h3>The Purest and Most Sincere Sympathy: Elementary School Students Donate "Read Old Books"</h3>
<p>Our newspaper is running eleven free elementary schools, and in the past ten days, it has attracted sponsorship from all sides, especially from schools and elementary school students, who sympathize with those out of school and donate money and books, responding most strongly. Yesterday, the entire senior and junior classes of Daren Elementary School and the entire fifth-grade class of the Ningbo Association's First Elementary School in Shanghai sent letters, because they heard from their teachers about our newspaper's running of free schools, and they automatically used the power of collective sympathy to save money on candy, snacks, and pastries, and launched a campaign to donate old books they had read. We feel that this is the purest and most sincere form of sponsorship. We can excitedly say that if we can universally gain the pure and sincere resonance of all elementary school students in the city, the foundation of the ten free schools we are running can be entrusted to their sympathy. However, we hope that the scope of the free schools will be further expanded, and of course, we also hope that influential figures from all walks of life in society will also rise up to sponsor them. Do adults in society, especially influential figures, not have the same enthusiasm as elementary school students? Please read the letters from the elementary school students!</p>
<p>First: "Last week, we heard from our teacher that your newspaper was going to run ten free schools to help many out-of-school children. We were very excited to hear this. Because we are very fortunate that we can continue our studies even in these difficult times, but when we see those little compatriots wandering in the streets and lingering outside the school gates, we often feel infinite sadness. We are all future masters of the country, so why are their experiences so different from ours!</p>
<p>Now that we know that you gentlemen are enthusiastically advocating the running of free schools, we are so happy for the out-of-school children that we almost want to jump up, because they also have the opportunity to study. Therefore, several of our classmates saved the money for the past few days' snacks and desserts, totaling 15,200 yuan, and all of our classmates contributed a total of 839 old books that we had used before to your newspaper office. We hope to set up several free schools to save a few 'blind people with bright eyes' and create a few more useful talents for the country. We also hope that all the children in Shanghai will respond enthusiastically and do their best to help others. However, we are still in school and rely on our families for everything, so even if we have the will, we lack the strength, and the donations are limited. Therefore, we sincerely hope that influential people from all walks of life can donate more to make the cause a success. The entire senior and junior classes of the private Daren Elementary School bow."</p>
<p>Second: "Since we heard about the free school movement initiated by your newspaper from our teachers, all the students in the school have expressed enthusiastic sympathy and support, especially the younger ones, who are particularly enthusiastic. They immediately presented the snack money they had saved in the past few days to be used as free school funds. Our class also held a class meeting for this matter and discussed it for a long time. Everyone agreed that the 'free school movement' is a more pressing need today. Our class leader, Qiu Lanfen, said: 'In addition to deeply hoping that people from all walks of life will respond, it is best to mobilize all the students in the city to save a pancake's worth of money and donate it to the "free school fund." If there are 100,000 students studying in the city, wouldn't there be a huge amount of five million yuan? And this is very easy to do.' Everyone heard this and thought it was very right. They immediately took out the money they had prepared to save for a few days' worth of pancakes and raised 13,000 yuan to donate to the "free school fund." We think that if the students in the city can universally rise up, it will definitely attract the attention of the powerful people in society and gain their understanding! Our slogan is: 'Pancake money, help free schools!' 'Donating to free schools, happy in our hearts!' All students of the fifth grade of the First Elementary School of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, Wang Qi."</p>
<p>Third: "Our school was founded by the school board in the second semester of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. Its purpose is to help poor out-of-school children, provide them with complete elementary school education, cultivate excellent character, and cultivate national citizens. Tuition and book fees are free. The relationship between the school board, the principal, the faculty, and the students is different from that of ordinary schools, that is, the entire school has the love of a family, without distinction between high and low. In order to cooperate with the school board's relief work such as providing clothing, porridge, medical treatment, and medicine, our school pays special attention to home visits. From the visits, we can see the extent of the students' family difficulties, which is beyond what ordinary people can imagine. According to statistics, more than 70% of all students eat coarse grains, 20% eat three meals of porridge, and only a few eat two porridges and one meal. Each semester, the number of students who register often exceeds the planned number of students, and it is a pity that we cannot accommodate them as much as possible due to economic constraints. Recently, we heard that your newspaper has initiated the establishment of ten free elementary schools and has received the support of people from all walks of life, with the ability to pool resources and efforts. Not only can the success of the ten schools be expected, but it can also be extended to achieve the completion of the initial free education. Although our school is small, its purpose is consistent. We will definitely follow behind, constantly encouraging ourselves to achieve complete success. We have specially sorted out more than 500 books and donated them as textbooks for free schools, and donated 13,775 yuan. We pray that you will check and accept them. Hua Guang Free School."</p>
<p>Fourth: We are very moved and admire your newspaper's kindness when we saw that your newspaper wanted to run free schools to educate those out-of-school children, giving them the opportunity to study. We think we live together in a society and should have a spirit of mutual help. But our strength is very small, all we have are old books. In addition, we have done our best, although it is only a small amount, it is also our responsibility. We also hope that all the children in Shanghai schools will rise up to donate, the future of free schools is bright and brilliant! Attached is a Central Reserve Bank note for 23,900 yuan and 414 textbooks. From the students of Bi Hua Elementary School.</p>
<p>Fifth: I am a student in class 2B who is requesting a scholarship from our school. These days, I heard the teachers say that helping others is helping oneself. I thought that I am also a person who is helped to study. If I did not have the scholarship donations from my classmates, how would I have books to read? So, I said to the classmates in my class: "Dear friends, we see the free school funds being sent to the Shen Bao every day. I hope that our class's wealthy students will also take some out to donate." They were very enthusiastic when they heard these words and donated. Now the total is 20,000 yuan, which I am sending now, please accept it. Sincerely, Feng Zhenbaobao, a scholarship student from the 2B grade of the First Elementary School of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sixth: In today's Chinese society, there are indeed too many children who do not enjoy schooling. Take Shanghai as an example, we can always see many wandering children lying in the streets and alleys every day. They are like a flock of lost lambs, wasting their golden time, which is really a pity, but it is also a major loss to the country! Therefore, since your newspaper established free elementary schools and Mr. Xie Lilin launched the movement to solicit free school funds, all walks of life have responded one after another. The students of all grades in our school are very enthusiastic and have saved their snack money to donate to the free school fund. Our class even convened a temporary class meeting for this matter a long time ago. Now we will first donate the 5,100 yuan we have donated to the free school fund. Although this number is small, we will still do our best to fulfill this duty that we should fulfill in life, and at the same time hope that all the children in the city will respond in unison, so that the illiteracy of our future China can be swept away. All the students of the sixth grade of the First School of the Ningbo Association.</p>
<p>In addition, Guoguang Elementary School donated 655 new and old textbooks for various subjects in elementary school. Guanghan Elementary School students donated more than 200 books, Zhimin Elementary School donated 135 books, and Huang Yuechang donated 6 books. Their enthusiasm for free education is commendable.</p>
<p>Solving the Pain of Illiteracy: Free Schools are an Important Task</p>
<p>A worker from Jiandong Printing Company, Zhi Nian, wrote a letter saying: "I am a worker with little education. Because I don't know many characters, I often encounter difficulties. Therefore, when I see people who are unwilling to study, I always try to persuade them so that they don't suffer the same pain as I do. Now that I see your newspaper running free elementary schools and Mr. Xie Linli launching the 'Free School Fund' movement, I feel that it is an important task at a time when there are a large number of out-of-school children. Therefore, I am willing to save 1,000 yuan from my daily expenses to use as 'Free School Funds,' and I have asked my colleagues Lu Shanchu, Li Yanzhong, and Yue Shuhai to each donate 500 yuan, totaling 2,500 yuan in national currency. Although the amount is very small, it is also my intention. I know that there are many people in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about education, and I hope that they can take out more money to save the general out-of-school children!"</p>

<p>Special Issue Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital</p>
<h3>The Chinese Economy in the Five Years Since the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>— By Wu Sheng</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, five years have passed since the National Government returned to the capital. As the saying goes, "A small change in five years, a big change in ten years." In these five years of turbulent times, the current state of the Chinese economy has also undergone transformation and evolution, resulting in a major change. However, which path has the overall economic trend taken over the past five years? How exactly did the National Government's economic policies operate, and what were their repercussions? Although these issues are now in the past, they are still worth reminiscing about and examining.</p>
<p>When the National Government returned to the capital, the overall situation was roughly settled, but there were sores everywhere. At that time, the main aim of economic work was recovery. Internally, it focused on establishing finance and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Externally, it aimed at Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and joint construction. Until the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Central China economy was affected by the fluctuations of the world war situation and began to enter another stage. That is to say, whether in finance or trade, foreign relations gradually became isolated, and it became necessary to establish a self-sufficient economy. On the one hand, due to the decline of British and American economic power, various large-scale businesses formerly operated by British and American merchants were gradually taken over by Chinese people themselves. As a result, financial, insurance, and previously unseen investment groups were established one after another, transforming the face of the economic society. On the other hand, due to the reduction of imported materials and the expansion of consumption due to the prolonged war, the supply of materials could not be smoothed out. As a result, the price issue became the core of economic problems. Under these different conditions of objective circumstances, the National Government implemented various economic policies to save the economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, such as strengthening control, passively preventing economic disruption, and increasing production, actively seeking to improve the economic status quo. Although the effects were not significant, it has indeed established many great achievements.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy in the five years since the return to the capital can be roughly divided into four or five stages. From the return to the capital to the outbreak of the Great East Asia War in December of the 30th year, it was a period of post-war economic recovery, which can also be said to be a period of economic stability. In the 31st year, the old and new legal currencies were separated, causing great disturbances in the financial market. At that time, idle capital was rampant, and financial institutions developed abnormally. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance began active management of financial institutions, so this period can be said to be a period of currency system consolidation, and also a period of financial turmoil. On February 3rd of the 32nd year, the National Economic Conference decided on five guidelines for wartime economic policy, and the path that the Central China economy should take was finally established. The so-called economic control gradually entered the practical stage from this time on, such as the establishment of the Shanghai Business Control Association in March, the establishment of the Materials Review Committee by the National Government, and the announcement of the Provisional Regulations for the Movement of Materials in the Yangtze River Region by the Japanese side. In April, the investigation of speculative hoarding institutions in Shanghai was thorough, and in August, the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the measures for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth. Therefore, this period can be said to be a period of material control. However, the commodity market at that time was still full of a speculative hoarding atmosphere. Everyone felt that materials were becoming scarce day by day, and believed that hoarding goods was better than hoarding currency. This trend intensified, making the material and price issues increasingly serious. It was not until the government began the work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth that the overall situation was stabilized. Therefore, this period can be called a period of material control, and also a period of speculation and hoarding. At the beginning of the 33rd year, the government made increasing production the focus of its policies. From the hard-fought experience of economic control work over the past year, it deeply realized that under the social environment in China, relying solely on the power of control was not enough to promote the smooth progress of economic work and the reasonable solution of people's livelihood problems. Control work and increased production must go hand in hand, and only then could the economic status quo be improved. In reality, the material production capacity in recent years has been too weak. Transportation problems, fuel and electricity problems, raw material problems, and production cost problems have only become more and more serious. The relevant authorities have worked hard and sincerely in this year to fight against the obstacles, targeting the real problems. Unfortunately, the issue of increasing production involves too much. Although a great deal of effort has been put in, it has not achieved sufficient results. Instead, the industry and commerce have become increasingly decadent, and the reduction in material production has inevitably led to a rise in prices. Four unprecedented waves of price increases occurred within a year. Therefore, the 33rd year can be named the Year of Increased Production, and it can also be named the Year of Prices.</p>
<p>In the five years since the return to the capital, the economic world has undergone such great changes, and the results of the transformation have been quite unsatisfactory. From a period of financial turmoil to a period of speculation and hoarding, and then from a period of speculation and hoarding to a period of serious prices, people's lives have become more and more difficult day by day. This is the reality, and this is an undeniable fact. However, it is right to attribute the difficulty of people's livelihood to the irrationality of the economic situation. If we blame it on the inappropriate policies of the authorities, it would be unfair. Try to briefly analyze the various special environments that our country has encountered internally and externally since the return to the capital, and compare it with the economic work of the past five years. Indeed, it has made a great contribution to the way to a sound economy. Now, I will make a simple review and summary of the salient points.</p>
<p>(1) Establishing Finance and Improving Finance</p>
<p>Finance is the mother of all administrations. Without money, there is no way to govern. Therefore, at the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China, it first established finance. From the financial policy announced by Finance Minister Zhou, we can see the focus of finance at that time, which included:</p>
<p>(1) Stabilizing finance, (2) Maintaining the credit of public bonds, (3) Consolidating national taxes, (4) Abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, (5) Guiding idle capital, (6) Consolidating trade, (7) Regulating people's livelihoods, (8) Assisting production.</p>
<p>Due to the changes in the objective environment, the content of the National Government's fiscal revenue and expenditure after the war has changed significantly compared to before the war. Before the war, customs and salt taxes were the mainstay of revenue. Now, the status of customs and salt taxes has declined, and we have to rely on other taxes or other sources of income as the backbone of revenue. According to the "Overview of One Year's Administration" published by Chen Zhishi of the Ministry of Finance in March of this year, the total national budget for the first half of the 34th year was 360 million yuan per month, which was still about 40 million yuan less than the expenditure, and there was an attempt to issue public bonds to make up for the overdraft. "As for the budget object, guaranteeing public security is the most important, accounting for more than 60% of the total budget. The decision is to increase production, followed by improving treatment." The so-called "guaranteeing public security" probably refers to military and police expenses, and the so-called "increasing production" probably refers to expenses in the areas of finance and industrial construction. The total national budget is 360 million yuan per month. If we consider the low value of the currency, then compared with the National Government's finances before the war, we can see how low it is. With these expenses, to do so many things, we should deeply understand the government's frugality and the spirit of hard work under such a poor financial environment. This is the reality of the government's finances in the past five years.</p>
<p>As for finance, after the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the Central China economy underwent qualitative changes with the sharp changes in the international situation. Therefore, two phenomena occurred: one was that the old and new legal currencies lost their link value, and the other was the rise of Chinese and foreign financial forces in Shanghai. On March 30th of the 31st year, the Ministry of Finance announced the abolition of the equal exchange of old and new legal currencies, and began proportional conversion in late May, so as to gradually eliminate the old currency, expand the scope of circulation of the new legal currency, and stop the issuance of military tickets, so that the Central China region became a monolithic situation of Central Reserve Certificates. After a short period of struggle, it finally completed the arduous task.</p>
<p>During the period of currency system consolidation, the financial world was temporarily in great confusion. In addition, idle capital was rampant, and the economic activities of Zhushang were in a state of stagnation due to the Great East Asia War. As a result, Chinese banks, money shops, silver companies, trust companies, real estate companies, insurance companies, investment companies, enterprise groups, etc. rose up one after another, taking the opportunity to become active. The prosperity of the establishment was unprecedented. The independent expansion of Chinese financial power was best at this time. However, the good and the bad were mixed, and the speculative color was very strong. It was not enough to develop industrial finance, and there was more than enough to undermine the order of the economic market. The authorities of the Ministry of Finance had foreseen this, and in January of the 31st year, they promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions to restrict it. After that, it was strengthened again and again. In the autumn of the 33rd year, the Ministry of Finance announced the Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in Shanghai Special City, and made further strict supervision of the business of various firms. Although the financial market failed to correct the source from this, the speculative hoarding atmosphere of various firms has been greatly frustrated.</p>
<p>(2) Comprehensive Implementation of Controlled Economy</p>
<p>With the persistence of the war situation, loopholes occurred everywhere in the operation of the free economy. Control work became increasingly tight due to the needs of the facts. On February 12th of the 32nd year, the First Plenary Meeting of the National Economic Committee passed five guidelines for wartime economic policy, which were promulgated and implemented by the National Government on the 13th. The content was:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding increasing producers</p>
<p>(2) Regarding adjusting prices</p>
<p>(3) Regarding saving consumers</p>
<p>(4) Regarding setting currency values and adjusting the balance</p>
<p>(5) Regarding improving economic institutions</p>
<p>The scope mentioned is very wide, and accurate guiding principles have been established for all departments of economic activity. The promotion of wartime economic work in the future will not go beyond the norms of the guidelines.</p>
<p>On March 11th of the 32nd year, the National Defense Conference discussed the issue of wartime material control. In terms of control institutions, it was decided to establish the National Commercial Control Association. In terms of implementation methods, the Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Wartime Materials were formulated, and the National Government issued an order: "The Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Wartime Materials have been promulgated. All regulations on the movement of materials in the Qingxiang area and the proposed rules for the movement of materials in and out of the country, and other similar provisions for the movement of materials, except for rice, shall be abolished." The next day (12th), the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on the Management of Rice Sales in Zhejiang and Anhui. The Japanese Army, Navy, and Embassy jointly announced the Provisional Regulations on the Movement of Materials in the Yangtze River Region. From then on, fragmented and piecemeal material movement restrictions were changed to autonomous control by the Commercial Control Association, except for special materials. On the 16th, the Commercial Control Association established a material movement permit office, and took over the material movement permit matters from April 17th.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, with the assistance of the Sino-Japanese Normal Bureau, it continued to move towards autonomous control. The first step was to start organizing joint associations of various industries. In the beginning, the preparatory directors and preparatory committee members of the various industry joint guarantee associations were designated by the competent department (grain or food), and supervisory officials were sent to supervise and guide the various industry joint associations to handle matters related to control. In addition to the various industry joint associations and trade associations, the Commercial Control Association, in order to ensure the careful management of the lower-level organizations, also established professional committees for various important businesses (which were changed to control committees when the Commercial Control Association was reorganized last year) to establish a complete and sound control system. Later, the Commercial Control Association underwent several changes, but as of today's fifth anniversary of the return to the capital, the spirit of merchant autonomous control still remains. Repeatedly, that is to say, each local area established trade associations by merchants in various industries, and united the trade associations in various places to establish industry joint associations. On the one hand, for various important business aspects, Chinese and Japanese merchants jointly organized business professional committees. Above them is the National Commercial Control Association.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the National Government specially established a Materials Control Review Committee to strengthen material control and urge the Commercial Control Association to improve its functional use. Its tasks were: one, to be the National Government's review agency for controlled materials, and two, to be the Sino-Japanese liaison agency for material control agreements. After the establishment of the association, it worked in tandem with the Commercial Control Association, one being the practical agency and the other being the review agency. From then on, the Central China economy was incorporated into the scope of control.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the merchants came from the autonomy to govern themselves, and on the other hand, the government gradually took a positive attitude towards cracking down on speculation and hoarding. For example, in April of the 32nd year, Chairman Wang specially ordered a thorough investigation of speculative hoarding institutions in Shanghai, and the Finance and Industry departments jointly investigated the giant mortgage loans entrusted by banks. The Shanghai Economic Bureau investigated the materials stored in warehouses, and the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the regulations on punishing the crime of hoarding goods. Still afraid that it would not achieve sufficient results, it established the Special Materials Investigation Committee in Shanghai on June 19th to intensify investigation and crackdown work, and the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth temporarily made the atmosphere of speculation and hoarding almost cease.</p>
<p>(3) Increase Production</p>
<p>However, the stability of people's livelihoods and the soundness of the economy cannot be achieved by passive material control. The solution to the problem still lies in how to increase production. Otherwise, although material hoarding is cracked down on, there are still many ways out for investment other than materials. If control work is operated properly, it can prevent the occurrence of various economic contradictions, but the thorough improvement of the economic status quo cannot be achieved without cooperation with construction work. Especially in China after the war, the production process has not yet recovered, and the production progress is slower than the consumption figures. It is difficult to protect the smooth supply of materials and the stability of people's livelihoods by increasing production to the outside world. However, increasing production must have the conditions for increasing production and the determination to remove production obstacles. Otherwise, it is just empty talk and does not help the reality. If we have made the greatest efforts to eliminate production obstacles and are still limited by factual difficulties and cannot achieve the practical effect of increasing production, this is a special situation in wartime, and it is also a common phenomenon in belligerent countries. We only have to review the past efforts and consider whether they are appropriate and whether there is room for improvement.</p>
<p>The production in the five years since the return to the capital does not seem to have made much progress. Whether in agriculture or in industry, in the most recent year, it has only become increasingly thin and declining. According to past experience, there are about five obstacles to agricultural production: one is poor rural public security, two is frequent exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, three is unreasonable purchase prices, four is the lack of fertilizer, farm tools, plough cattle, and capital, and five is that farmers cannot buy daily necessities, so their desire to produce is not excited enough. There are also the following obstacles to industrial production: one is the lack of raw materials, two is the reduction in the supply of electricity and coal, three is transportation difficulties, four is high production costs and sometimes unreasonable purchase prices, and five is that there are more convenient and simpler ways to make money than production.</p>
<p>Because production has not been able to proceed very smoothly, the price problem has become increasingly serious. In order to solve the crux of high prices and improve the difficult lives of the people, we hope that the production problem can be quickly turned around. Recently, the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, which is responsible for agricultural production, announced the agricultural production work for the 34th year of the Republic of China, and has a detailed plan for monthly production work. This is an expression of further launching practical agricultural production work targeting production obstacles based on past painful experience. At the same time, the problem of industrial dispersion in Shanghai and the problem of coal transportation have recently shown signs of improvement, and it can be said that industrial production has broken away from the worst scene and reached the road to regeneration.</p>
<p>Although the production situation in the past five years has not been very colorful, the increased production starting in the sixth year has possessed hope and great possibilities. As long as we continue to work hard, the economic future is full of light, and please wait and see everything in the future.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Propaganda Office Publishes a Letter to the Public</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office published the original text of the "Letter to the Citizens of this City on the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital":</p>
<p>It has been exactly five years since the National Government returned to the capital on March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China. The most important goal and the most significant meaning of the National Government's return to the capital are to seek peace and unity internally and to strive for independence and freedom externally. After five years of efforts, overall peace has not yet been achieved, but we have already had valuable gains. In terms of internal affairs, whether it is political construction or economic recovery, there have been considerable achievements. In terms of diplomacy, we have recovered concessions and abolished extraterritoriality.</p>
<p>Since joining the war on January 9th of the year before last, our country has jointly shouldered the mission of defending East Asia with the Allied Japan, and has fought against Britain and the United States with one heart and one mind, realizing the Pan-Asianism advocated by the Founding Father and the legacy of fighting together with the nations of the world who treat us equally. Because there is imperialism in Asia, peace cannot be realized. Therefore, we not only demand the realization of unity and peace, but also demand true peace in all of East Asia, so as to achieve the goal of national liberation, independence, and freedom.</p>
<p>On this fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the Great East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, and our responsibilities in the future will naturally become even more important. But unfortunately, the late Chairman has left us again. When the various ethnic groups in East Asia are competing for survival, it is also a good opportunity for us to strive for independence and freedom and achieve realization. We should seize this precious opportunity, for China, for East Asia, and also to mourn the late Chairman, we must not be lazy or negligent, and contribute everything to the country, so as to complete the great task of the National Government's return to the capital as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Now, Acting Chairman Chen is an elder statesman of the party and the country, and continues to lead the people of the country in their old struggles. We should be more firm in our beliefs, recognize one ideology, and follow the three major national policies instructed by the late Chairman Wang under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen.</p>
<p>First, truly think. Every citizen must wash away corrupt thoughts, reduce individualism, move forward in unison, fundamentally eradicate social evils, abandon the bottom and strengthen the strength of the country, and realize national groupism.</p>
<p>Second, ensure public security. Although this is the responsibility of the military and police, the people must be united with the military and police at all times and in all places, and gather all their strength so that public security can be established and the people can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Third, increase production. During wartime, the lack of materials is a natural phenomenon in any country. Although the government is doing its best to implement production increase campaigns, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, every country has a general responsibility. We must not only actively assist the government in increasing production, but also, in terms of consumption, save consumption, be diligent and self-disciplined, contribute to the country, and enhance our carrying capacity.</p>
<p>On this day when we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we must thoroughly recognize the situation, endure hardship, work harder, cooperate with the allies, complete the war, and eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. Implement the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, to revitalize China and strive for the victory of the Great East Asia War, so as to defend East Asia.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Anniversary of the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>As the calendar turns to March 30th of the Old Republic Year 29, a scene celebrating the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital is presented before us.</p>
<p>Five years is by no means a long time. Those who find themselves amidst the turbulent currents of the world may truly feel that time flies too quickly. However, every time we try to recall five years ago, the arduous and difficult efforts of the late Chairman Wang in establishing peace, and the scars of war-torn China, covered in weeds and yet to recover, a review of the process of promoting peace over the past five years... These scenes seem like events of yesterday.</p>
<p>Five years, a brief five years. China has opened up new territories from ruins. The two great nations of China and Japan have moved from understanding and cooperation to becoming allies fighting shoulder to shoulder... This is the most glorious and splendid day in the new history of China.</p>
<p>The Capital - Today, five years ago, March 30th of the Republic Year 29, the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun was once again flying over Nanjing, the capital.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock on an early spring morning, the late Chairman Wang, with a radiant spirit, appeared in the auditorium of the Nanjing National Government. At this moment, a solemn and respectful ceremony for the return to the capital was being held.</p>
<p>"Based on the principle of neighborly friendship, mutual anti-communism, and sincere cooperation, we will work together with our friendly nation Japan to establish amicable relations, realize peace in East Asia, eliminate past dictatorial politics, and plan to convene a national assembly..." The late Chairman Wang, in a sonorous tone, read aloud a section of this historic declaration of the return to the capital, word by word, so that all the civil and military officials present listened attentively in the solemn atmosphere, focusing their gaze on the stage. The fervent emotions in everyone's hearts burst forth at that moment.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, majestic military music wafted from afar on Zhongshan North Road. A large group of young people, marching in orderly steps, headed towards National Central University. This was the procession participating in the grand military parade celebrating the return to the capital. The winding ranks symbolized this surge of new life, which had begun to surge and stir. At this moment, the motherland was opening its kind arms to them.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the International Club, which had once served as the venue for the Central Political Committee meetings, was now hosting a grand reception for foreign guests to celebrate the return to the capital. The late Chairman Wang spoke joyfully to the dignitaries from various countries, a hint of a smile on his face. From escaping Hanoi to today's return to the capital, he had written a tragic poem. Later, when raising a glass to wish the guests good health, a harmonious atmosphere spread to every corner of the venue.</p>
<p>Shanghai - Shanghai, a short distance from the capital, also simultaneously raised the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, symbolizing peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction, on the top floor of the Jianghai Customs House on the Bund, welcoming the wind. In front of the Zhabei Municipal Government Building, a huge red banner hung high, adorned with a string of golden characters that read "Shanghai Municipal Joint Celebration of the National Government's Return to the Capital." A burst of loud cheers was the song of praise from the majority of the people. Now that they were able to stand happily on this peaceful land, their heartfelt joy should be clearly evident on their faces. Look: the number of people who have joined the political affairs committees has exceeded 170,000, accounting for three-tenths of the city's population. This is clear proof that the old capital has been endowed with a new life and new vitality. It also sufficiently reflects how enthusiastically the people of North China are supporting the unified National Government. What is especially inspiring is the sight of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flags fluttering in the streets and lanes, creating a deeply moving impression.</p>
<p>Hankou - In Hankou, the frontline of the peace zone, a celebration rally with the same significance was being held in Zhongshan Park. When the large group of Wuhan citizens who had returned after the disaster saw the huge portrait of the leader displayed at the venue, they could not help but recall the lofty spirit of the leader who had escaped from Hanoi and delivered his fervent speech. Seeing this piece of land after the catastrophe, they understood that only the leader's dedication and sacrifice could have rescued them from danger, further recognizing the leader's great achievements, which are as immortal as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>On this day, the sound of jubilation throughout the country not only spread across North and Central China but also echoed throughout South China. In Guangzhou, this major city in southern China had put on a new appearance, welcoming this great holiday. The people's lantern parade held that night, with its colorful lanterns and dazzling torches, formed a splendid picture. Then, stirring military songs were sung by every parading participant. The electric cheers of the spectators on both sides of the road formed this lively scene, showing that China's path to a bright future was emerging in the light of the torches.</p>
<p>Five years have passed in the blink of an eye. These series of scenes linger in my mind. Looking back, my spirits are greatly lifted.</p>
<p>For the past five years, the sound of national jubilation has reverberated through the clouds. The year before last, we further resolutely embarked on the journey of defending Greater East Asia together with our ally Japan. The sound of national jubilation has turned into a shared sense of hatred against the enemy. Last year, the people of the country tearfully mourned the loss of their leader and marched forward under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, showing that with the same cries of support, the responsibility has been gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Today, five years later, especially as we joyfully celebrate this day's return during the current decisive battle, the scenes of past jubilation serve as the clearest mirror to give us courage, peace, light, and happiness. We must always cherish and wipe away any dust from this bright impression! (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Speeches by Wen Lantang and Yuan Ludeng Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Wen Lantang, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, and Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, issued the following statements on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital:</p>
<p>Wen Lantang's Statement: The National Government's return to the capital marks its fifth anniversary. Over these five years, the people of our country, relying on the leadership of the officials of the government, have rescued the nation's fortunes from turmoil, allowing the people to live and work in peace. The government, based on its determination to share life and death, has cooperated with friendly nations to participate in the war, working together with concerted efforts to rise up in unity. For the past five years, the people across the country have all tightened their belts, endured hardship, and dedicated everything to the government, hoping for the liberation of the Chinese nation. However, the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai have experienced numerous hardships, and production has sharply declined, reaching a critical point. In addition, recently, agricultural products have suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities, and food supplies have become increasingly inadequate. Although the people are eager to serve the country, they are overwhelmed by their daily lives. Therefore, I hope that the government will immediately focus on people's livelihood, resolve all difficulties, stabilize people's lives, and vigorously promote increased production work, so as to assist the government in seeking final victory.</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Statement: Now that the Greater East Asia War is entering its decisive stage, we are celebrating the fifth anniversary of the return to the capital. We recall that at the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, the people across the country were in deep distress. Fortunately, under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, government officials and people actively promoted peace, allowing the people to rebuild their old businesses and engage in work. Shanghai's industry and commerce have moved from revival to prosperity. The achievements of the government officials over the past five years have truly inspired the respect of all people. At this moment, the soldiers of our friendly nation on the front lines are bravely fighting the enemy to defend East Asia. We must spare no effort to actively promote increased production, provide supplies, and assist the government's determination to participate in the war. I sincerely hope that the representatives attending the Wartime People's Congress convened in Nanjing must each contribute their great plans and fully support the national policy to seek the survival of the Chinese nation and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
