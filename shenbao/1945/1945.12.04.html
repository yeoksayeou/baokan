<h3>陪都十六個文化團體　發表對時局聯合宣言</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶三日電〕陪都中國著作人協會等十六文化團體，頃發表對時局聯合宣言，全文如下：</p>
<p>八年的抗戰，是最神聖的，也是最艱辛的，我們同胞拋頭顱，洒熱血，無力的也出力，無錢的也出錢，離鄉背井，捨母棄妻，一切戰時的痛苦，我們都在忍受，都在咬緊牙關地忍受。我們已經忍受八年了，抗戰業經勝利了，還不讓我們享受和平嗎？還要我們忍受痛苦嗎？民亦勞止，迄可小休，我們要求和平，我們反對內亂，誰發動內亂，誰就是我們的敵人。在這抗戰當中，我們國家港受了有史以來第一次的大破壞，有多少繁榮的城鎭，巳變成一片焦土，有多少新興的工塲，只剩下一片瓦礫，有多少燦爛的文化，已變成一片刦灰。</p>
<p>要建設大統一國家</p>
<p>現在勝利了，還不讓我們在破壞的廢墟上重新建設我們的祖國嗎？還不讓我們在頹垣破瓦上重新建設我們的家園嗎？我們要求生活，我們要求建設，誰阻止我們建設的，誰要在破壞之後更要破壞的，誰就是我們的敵人。建設最先，建國第一，我們所要建設的國家，是大一統的國家，只有統一的闕家，才是現代化的國家，也只有統一的國家，才能担負起建國的偉業。</p>
<p>我們原是應戰，好容易愈戰愈强，竟一躍而爲五强之一，我們是才抬得起頭，講得起亮話的，又豈能在此時期自至分裂，使國家不能成爲現代的國家，國民不能成爲現代的人民。我們擁護統一，我們反對分裂，誰製造分裂的，說就是我們的敵人。</p>
<p>擁護民主要求法治</p>
<p>大兵之後，必正紀綱，在八年抗戰當中，社會極大的變動，假使沒有紀綱，沒有法治怎麼能恢復社會的秩序，又怎樣能建立民主的國家。民主是與法治並行的，無法治即無民主，我們擁護民主，我們要求法治，敗亂法紀的人，正是民主的罪人，也是我們的敵人。然而不幸得很，當我們要求民主統一和平建設的時候，共產黨却正在進行反民主，反統一，反和平，反建設的一種大叛亂。</p>
<p>當日本投降之初，共產黨即不顧同盟國的決定，不顧最高統帥的命令，擅發所謂延安總部命令，爭取違法的受降權，先則單獨的進兵受降，繼則阻礙並且攻擊受降的國軍，更繼之對全國各地國軍作普遍的襲擊，自廣州而至歸綏，處處有共產黨軍隊圍攻國軍的事實，自受降以至於現在，日日有共產黨軍隊圍城攻地的報道，人民何辜，橫遭殺戮，我們所希望的和平在那裏？鐵路建築橫遭破壞，我們所希望的建設在那裘？共黨割據稱兵，形同封建，我們所需求的統一在那裏？共產黨反對國民大會之召開，不以政爭，而以兵亂，我們所要求的民主在那裏？</p>
<p>促進共產黨停止內亂</p>
<p>共產黨亦自知，此種叛亂違反國民之要求，乃玩弄名詞，盜竊名義，思推卸其內亂的責任，欲以一手盡掩天下人的耳目，他們也在喊民主，以便其反國家反政府的私圖，而不同民主之必須法治，必有紀綱。他們大喊其所謂「解放區」，以掩護其割據分裂的事實，而不問其所謂「解放區」者究從何人手中奪取，他們也大喊「反對內戰」，以博取愛好和平人民的同情，並推卸其發動內亂的責任，而不問所謂「內戰」實由內亂而來，像這樣的欺世盜名，適足證明其心勞日絀。這叛亂是正在擴大了，如果共產黨意孤行，從澈朱德武力的路綫，則人民將何以爲生，國家將何以爲國。</p>
<p>我們都是致力文化工作的團體，有首應揭　盜竊名義，掀亂是非陰謀的義務，亦有重提民主統一，和平建設要求的責任，想共產黨人不乏明哲之士，全國國民亦非盡可欺之人，倘共產黨人願爲國民之友，則請停止內亂，或不參加其內亂，是亦國家民族之大福，倘仍執迷不悔，則不僅爲國家民族之大禍，抑亦爲我國國民之公敵，禍乎！福乎！敵乎！友乎！現正取決於每個共產黨員之一念，願以此挈告於全國同胞及共產黨人之前。中國著作人協會，中國發明協會，中國全國美術會，中國宗教徒聯誼會，中國天主敎文化協進會，中國佛學會，孔學會，人生哲學研究會，靑年研談會，中國心理建設協會，中華全國體育協進會，中國知行學社，中國邊疆協會，中國文藝會，中國海外事業文化協進會，中國靑年作者協會。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶三日電〕墨西哥京城中華商會，昭採公所，救國會等四團體，均電請蔣主席戡亂，以張國法，而維國本。</p>
<h3>社論　長沙水閘的建築</h3>
<p>—中國歷史上一件大事</p>
<p>在政治協商會議行將召開，東北局勢好轉聲中，我們不可輕易放過另一在中國的新生中很有意義的事，這就是長江水閘計劃的實行。美當局已與中國資源委員會簽訂合同，由美國工程　擬具計劃，在長江三峽建築空前偉大之水泥鋼骨大水閘，以控制水勢，使長江流域數千萬居民得免數百年來不絕發生之水災飢饉，且可利用水力，供給發電，同時預定建築其它水閘多座，開掘運河數千里，以供灌漑及其它各種設備。將來海船可直駛重慶。一切規劃均由美國水閘設計專家薩凡奇監督；該項計劃之發展，須時二十五年，並包括世界最大水力發電廠計劃在內。</p>
<p>這個合同的簽訂，在中國的歷史上是一件大事。長江雖不一定是「中國的憂患」，但是江水泛濫，有時也足以使無數人民遭殃，而最可惜的，這樣一條大川，蘊蓄着這樣大的水力，我們在過去未能利用，致使浪耗了自然給予我們的特殊恩惠。如今美國與我發訂合同，開發水利，這不僅使揚子江洗域得以　免水旱災難，且得以供給我大量廉價的動力，爲我國工業化奠定了堅固的基礎；同時，使揚子江航運的吞吐量得以提高，遠洋航行的船舶得以上駛巴蜀，一掃過去所謂蜀道難之歎。這計劃的全部成功，雖需要一個較長的時期，然而這計劃一旦成功，整個中國的面貌將全部改觀。中國將自手工業的階段，一躍而為電化的社會了。道合同的簽訂確是新中國建設過程中一件大事！</p>
<p>在建國過程中，水力的充分利用，是最基本亦最重要。蘇聯在實施五年計劃之前，就首先注意水力，在但尼伯河興建鉅大的水閘；利用但尼伯河的水力，發出巨量的動力，然後才能展開它的工業發展的計劃。原子彈的製造就靠了所謂TVA的大量廉價的電力，運輸設備，及工業設備。我們今方踏上建國的道路，將來建國的核心是工業化，工業化就得需要動力；所以我們第一步就來利用揚子江的水力，這可以說已爲我國的工業化和建國工程立了極好的基石。</p>
<p>况且揚子江水力的利用，還不止於供給我們以工業化所必需的動力。利用水力以產生動力，僅是利用水力的一端；它的主要目的，是在如何控制自然的水勢以爲人類謀福利。人類從最初就曉得怎樣利用水來爲人類造福。新石器時代的人就知道溶河灌漑之利。我們秦代的李冰在四川就利用了岷江的水，爲成都盆地興了農業之利，直到如今灌縣都江堰還爲世人稱頌，就是計劃利用揚子江水利的薩凡奇也大加讚歎。可是近代的利用水勢，還是晚近的事。這是故羅斯福總統在實施新政時所建立起的「田納河洗域管理局」所謂TVA的偉大計劃。田納西河洗域從前在美國是最爲貧瘠的區域，自從田納西河洗域管理局成立以來，以利用整條田納西河爲對象，終止貧瘠之地而變爲富庶。電化固然實現，就是農林工礦，以及社會福利等諸般事業，也都擴大展開，而成爲一個典型的民主實騐區域，爲世界開創了一個新局面。</p>
<p>這位計劃利用揚子江水利的薩凡奇，從前就是主持在納西可水利的設計人。據說，揚子江的充分利用，它將來的成就將超過TVA，而成世界上惟一的水利區。前幾天從美國來的消息說是原計劃將予以縮小，現在美國簽訂的合同，是否即是原計劃，電訊語焉不詳，我們無從測知，但不論是原計劃也好，是修正了的計劃也好，這合同的簽訂，無疑地明示了我政府對利用揚子江水力已具決心。在實施這計劃的時候，或將有不少田地　墓須被毀棄，這可能遭遇到人民的怨恨，甚至若干有力方面的阻撓。但是在民族福利的大前提下，我們都得忍受一切小我犧牲。</p>
<p>於此，我們又不免重有感慨。國家經過了長期戰事，政府決定與民更始，實行民生主義，而以揚子江水利的利用開其端。這表示了政府對建國的決心。而乃有破壞民族利益之徒，稱兵作亂，企圖阻撓建國大業，我們人民不容許建國的勝史工作再受到阻礙。我們於揚子江水利的利用，看到了民族的新生。我們願這新生畏成起來，庶幾中國達到當强康樂的理想境域。</p>

<p>〔中央社昆明二日電〕聯大師範學院手溜彈事件，茲據記者探詢所得，係由聯大學生與第二軍官總隊少數學員發生毆鬥而起，詳情如次：（一）第二軍官總隊學員一隊，於三十日按照規定，前往大觀樓參觀，經過聯大時，校內突有若干學生，以泥塊瓦石向該隊投擊，並呌駡侮辱，該隊初則依牆相避，而投石愈烈，遂相戰鬥，各有十餘人受傷。（）於該隊受　學員，以無故受辱，積不能平，當日曾投稿各報，未曾登出，尤增憤激。乃的集三十餘人，於一日上午十一時許，前往聯大師範學院，向該院學生質詢，致生衝突，當時突有一失業軍人陳雲增闖入，暗懷手榴彈數枚，毆鬥之際，向該院投擲，遂有十三人受傷。內重傷者四人，送雲大醫院診治，後不治逝世。其他輕傷學生，均在醫院診治中。（三）聯大於校舍文法學院，亦同時發生投擲手榴彈事件，但未傷人。現悉雲南省警備總司令部，已將兇犯陳雲增，及在文法學院之嫌疑犯一人拿獲，明日即將公開審訊，依法嚴辦。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾部署飛渝事　啓程前須出席國會兩次　赫爾利聲明仍在探究中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕美國新任駐華大使馬歇爾將軍，正忙於部署飛渝履新事宜。惟在啓程前，尚須於本星期內出席國會兩次：一次係向珍珠港被襲擊事件調查委員會陳述，一次係向參院外交委員會先事說明到渝使命。　〔中央社重慶三日電〕據美新聞處華盛頓一日電，美國會兩院議員，對前駐華大使赫爾利將軍所指責國務院之外交人員之各點，昨日仍表關切。衆議員羅吉斯提出議案，要求貝爾納斯將有關破壞美國對華政策一切情報交予國會。參議員魏利斯則於參院中演說批評美國之遠東政策，要求國務院加以闡明，並應整頓內部。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕非美國活動調查委員會委員孟德特今日宣稱：委員會於聆悉赫爾利指資後，將對國務院作澈底調查。據稱：赫爾利曾對美國外交界中之共產主義者，有所指責。吾人即將以此爲調查根據。吾人欲知赫氏所指共產主義者，究爲何人。彼等究竟如何妨害美國外交政策，並採用何種方法。願赫氏能予解答。如赫爾利所指責者，僅限於現有諸人，則吾人調查時即以此數人爲限。惟如另有其他國務院人員包括在內，則調查範圍亦將隨而擴大。予個人相信，國務院下級人員中，有親共產黨之防害外交政策者存於其間。吾人發現自海外傳來之報告，正由此輩共產黨信徒，故意將其竄改，另加塗飾，送呈國務院上級人員。予懷疑赫爾利大使所造報告，或已由此輩竄改。</p>

<h3>今日世界現象下之　三大經濟圈</h3>
<p>戰前聲勢赫赫之共產主義　但今戰後已不敵社會主義</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕據紐約泰晤士報特訪員撰文稱：就經濟觀察點而論，今日世界之現象，似可分爲三大部份，即：（一）資本主義；（二）半資本主義；（三）共產主義是；以美國西歐蘇聯爲其中心點。此三項分類，不久或將覺其不能適切，因中國印度甚至南美，或皆將屬於無類可入者。惟在目前之將來，此種分類，似尚適宜，蓋此三種不同之經濟社會，將依類覓求彼此貿易及與世界其餘各國貿易之道也。大不列顚非資本主義的社會，今正在演化中英國工黨，匪特未嘗建議將各項工業悉歸國家經營，抑且不欲出此，匪特不欲建立全權的經濟制度，抑且反對此種理想甚力。其目的祗在與私人專利及出產與僱工之限制博鬥，其所以接妝幾種工業與管制現仍在私人手中各項工業所行之專利習慣者，不外爲達此目的計耳。英國工黨政策，非爲半共產主義，惟爲完全一種不同的民主計畫政策，以求得達民主社會黨之目的。斯坎狄那維亞之各國，確亦如是。如英國之試騐得臻成功，則法國，荷蘭，比國，義國均將步英後塵。如上述民主社會主義之政策得臻成功，則西歐各國將不試行共產主義之經濟政策。三方面如能以善意接近各問題，則上述三種不同之制度，自能有良好之貿易關係，有在其間，唯有一端，能在最近之將來迫令西歐放棄民主社會主義計畫之試行，而改趨共產主義之政策，即美國以種種障碍，置於西歐前二政策進行之途徑中，而使彼等感覺僅後一政策爲其唯一可行之出路是。要知西歐今欲廻其潮洗，而復返至受控制的炎本主義，在現勢中已不可能云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕紐約泰晤士報記者爲文稱：社會主義之發展，顯然已出乎預言家意料之外。在一年甚至半年以前，政論家成料馬克斯主義之溫和革命派，必將屈服於由蘇聯爲後台之急進共產主義之下，猛獅固嘗向綿羊之愛，蓋如能使共產主義與社會主義締結同盟，則政治之統制，必能入於此强大集團之掌握。無產階級之獨裁，至此乃可確立。反動勢力，特權階級，以及新法西斯主義，均勢必至於低首，然而專實之演變，竟有出意料以外者，共產主義非但不能與社會主義結成同一陣綫，反已處於火併之局面。共產主義非但未能逐漸强大而吸收社會主義，民衆反多傾向社會主義。法·義·荷甚至德·奧及前之衛星國均已成社會主義派之天下，英國之現政府亦爲社會主義之政府，中歐之社會民主黨及農民黨，亦未始不屬於社會主義派，共產主義在戰爭以前，固屬聲勢赫赫、然至戰爭以後，猛獅竟已不敵綿羊矣。</p>

<h3>我國赴美學生　滯留新德里　薜專員與美方協商中</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里一日專電〕首途赴美之我國旅客婦女十三人孩童二人及學生五十人，現皆滯留此間，蓋美軍部禁止非軍人旅客搭乘美輪，此項措施之執行，事先各方對之無所知，顯係因美軍兵士發出怨言所致。蓋彼等認爲軍隊返國之遲延，皆因水上運輸局予非軍人以優先機會，中國駐印代理專員薛壽衡與各團體接洽後，定於一日與美國駐印專員就現况予以磋商。此項措施，非僅影響及中國學生，其準備赴美參加國務院文化計劃組之印人一百五十人，亦遭阻陣。今後搭輪優先權，將由此間美國務院代表決定。</p>
<p>專員公署證實取消非軍人旅客搭乘美輪及飛機之優先權，目前對於滯居加爾各答之學生，無法援助。據悉，外交與政府人員及其春屬，不在禁止之列。原定之每月中國區及印緬區之非軍人之平民，可有三百人獲得四等優先權一節，已因此予以取消。如此項辦法，亦適用於中國區，則滯印中國學生之唯一送徑，乃乘輪赴上海，在商輪復航時，搭乘赴美。</p>

<h3>國立編譯館</h3>
<p>— 吳鴻志</p>
<p>詩人白居易在「長恨歌」中，曾吟「蜀江水碧蜀山靑」之句。而冬初迄於春末的嘉陵江，便證實了這詩句的寫實。那樣的靑碧可愛，令人難以想像，更難以言喩。</p>
<p>國立編譯館，就在嘉陵江的西岸，這是一個規模頗大的文化學術機關，在艱苦的八年抗戰中，它一直成長着。」方面致敬許多文化學術的戰士，在飢寒綫上苦鬥，堅定地嚴守崗位；一方面也顯示國家在戰時像平時一樣地重視文化學術的工作。</p>
<p>館分六組：自然組，人文組，敎科用書組，敎育組，社會組，及專司全館行政事務的總務組；此外尚有不少委員會，如翻譯委員會，大學用書委員會，地名統一委員會等。一個在後方藏書最富的圖書館，也是它的一部分。</p>
<p>工作的人員，包括書記庶務等在內，有一百八十多名。他們的工作，有不時編審的中小學國定敎科書；已經完竣的物理，化學等科的中外統一的名詞；即將告成的醫藥名詞及地理名詞；還有供應一般靑年急需應用的中等百科辭典；正在編輯中的敎育大辭典；整理中的廿四史，翻譯中的哲學，文學，歷史等的世界名著；撰寫中的大學各科用書。均由專家執筆，也有特約館外專家編寫的。將來國家的物質建設邁進，文化的建設也必然急速地開展，等到印刷的條件改善以後，國立編譯館的成績必然會給全國人士所認識，而工作更將繁劇了。</p>
<p>在一列列長行黑色的屋子中，爲高大的翠綠的芭蕉所映掩的窗口下，一張張桌子旁，盡是一些埋頭伏案的文化戰士。許多盟邦人士，在鑑賞嘉陵江風光之餘，便道來參觀的（當然也有不少特地來參觀的）都驚嘆着中國在艱苦的抗戰期中，不僅靑年學子弦誦不　，尚有這樣一個大規模文化學術機關存在，似乎大出意外似的。而敵人當時的疲勞轟炸，也僅炸毀了幾小間屋子而已，却不能對這精神堡壘加以重大創傷，但它對敵人的「予打擊者以打擊」，却很沈重的。值茲勝利來臨，祝福國立編釋館前途無量。</p>

<h3>滬各廠礦復工貸款　政府准撥卅億元　規定以原料為抵押品</h3>
<p>〔本報專訪〕交通銀行經理李道南昨語本市記者：四聯　處為救濟本市各廠鑛，協助滬地工廠復工計，已撥借復工貸款三十萬萬元，該項款額，係依據上月二十九日在渝通過之「滬區鑛廠復工貸款實施辦法」，由四聯滬分處撥借。</p>
<p>滬各廠商貸款數額</p>
<p>各滬鑛廠申請貸款而已獲核准者，計有：中興煤鑛公司一萬萬元，申新各廠七萬萬元，永安紗廠七萬萬元，我方接收各敵營廠二萬五千萬元，　豐紗廠三萬萬元，美商上海電力公司五萬萬元，美商電話公司二萬元，英商自來水公司二萬萬元，此外尚有閘北水電公司申請之借款三萬萬元，已經滬分處審查合格，茲已轉呈渝總處審核。</p>
<p>防止囤積限制抵押</p>
<p>據李氏告記者：四總處貸款辦法以增强滬地工業生產爲唯一目標，故貸借款項限制甚嚴，各工廠擬商借復工貸款須首向四聯滬分處申請，由該處及主官機關同時進行審查，刻各紗廠及類似工廠由經濟部特派員辦事處審查，公用事業由本市公用局審查，麵粉廠由糧食部特派員辦事處審查，審查合格後，再由四聯行處呈總處核定。各工廠借款較少者，則可由商業銀行借貸，向四聯分處申請轉貼現。刻因防制囤積起見，各由請鑛廠祇准以原料爲抵押品，不得以製成品作抵，貸款利息的年息二分至三分六。據李氏云：本市工廠急需救濟，自四聯分處開始貸款後，本市工業狀態已見轉好。</p>

<h3>軍警憲協同　嚴密冬防</h3>
<p>本市冬防時期之治安問題，因戰後一切秩序尚未完全恢復常態致至爲各方關注，並引爲　憂。中央社記者昨特分訪負責維持本市治安之軍警憲各機關，據淞滬警備總司令部當局表示，本年度本市冬防治安，該部已與軍警憲各方面擬有具體計劃，且有足够之兵力及警　足以維持本市冬防時期之治安。</p>
<p>增派士兵加強警衛</p>
<p>在市區內，警備　部已決定於即日起，在各交通要道，增派士兵，場強警衛力量，其次，將本市劃爲五區，每區設一巡查隊，由軍警憲三方面配合組織，晝夜分班在各街道及公共娛樂塲所巡查。至於市郊治安，則由軍方負責，堅守閘北大塲三月轉戰緬甸之八十八師及七十一軍所屬部隊，已接防駐守本市四郊。</p>

<h3>調查敵人暴行　清算八年血債</h3>
<p>這是血債！我們應該儘量地正確的提出來，向敵人去淸算！自從上月六日，上海地方法院檢察處奉令調查敵人暴行後，前往登記的一天多一天，尤其昨天竟超過了一百四十人，他們好像對自己的父母一樣，把內心蘊藏好久的悲哀痛苦，傾在書記官之前。</p>
<p>這裏，可以知道敵人在這八年中它們是怎樣實行「親善」？除了酷刑，屠殺，侵佔，放火，强姦之外，再也找不出一些其他的事。登記表上每一字每一句都是血！都是淚！</p>
<p>人數雖多，但書記官余匋却十分和善，不嫌求詳的逐一詢問，殊值得欽佩。至昨日爲止，登記的總數，共計五百餘件，其中四分之三均屬市郊鄕民，市區僅佔一小部份，難道市區被害被蹂躪的，僅僅是這些嗎？</p>
<p>登記截止期，定本月六日，但視情形，或將延長幾天。這是給被害市民一個充裕機會，希望趕快將這筆血債提出來，同時希望當局一俟調查完畢，立刻彙呈政府，向敵人去清算，使這輩哭訴無門無家可歸的苦百姓，早日有個安慰，有個結果。他們才可以得到勝利的溫暖。</p>
<h3>黷武者的教訓！日僑悄然回國　昨日集中今日離滬</h3>
<p>（本報特寫）首批　國日僑昨天在滬江大學集中，準備搭「明　丸」返日，記者特地跑去，想看看這輩所謂「大東亞共榮圈」的羣衆們，此次回國到底是什麼情緒。</p>
<p>一進了滬江大學，就引起了我說不出的感慨，上海第一流的學府，被日軍佔據了這多年，已被　塌得不成樣子，以前整整齊齊，花木繁茂的校園，巳變成了一片荒蕪，在過去女生宿舍前大草　上，一排一排的日本男女老幼止在整理箱　，準備被海關軍警人員檢查行李。</p>
<p>一般的秩序都很好，雖然在這表的日本人沒有過去趾氣揚的態度，然而他們也不哭喪了臉，今大他們仗也打欺了，大半的家　　　了，然而回家究竟是回家。多數日人在不同的情緒下，歸老家還是在沒有辦法中的一個辦法。</p>
<p>昨天集中在滬江大學的一共有二千一百八十五個日僑。其中有抱在懷裏的嬰兒，有　走都走不動的老婆子，也有年壯力強過去在上海不可一世的日本商人，上海港口運輸司令謝　齡中將帶了其他第三方面軍的上級軍官特地親來指揮，警察局和海關也派了人來照料，因此秩序井然，檢查的手續也很迅捷，檢查的人員執行職務雖極嚴格，然態度却很和悅。這不禁引起了我想倘　若此次是中國僑民回國而由日本憲兵執行檢查，那時候的情形如何？</p>
<p>這次遺送回國的日僑，是依照第三方面軍日僑管理處所定的選擇方式，　同的資格是：（一）單身男女不能生活者，（二）不良份子，（三）有正當理田申請提早回國而蒙核准者，日本的軍人和政治上有關的人物一概不准回國，這是因為在戰爭罪犯未調查完畢前，以免有罪者漏網。</p>
<p>回國的日僑每人准帶行李三十公斤及日幣或國幣一千元，其他　　物品　　　等等—照相撥，金銀飾物及書本文具皆在禁帶之例。每人並准帶新衣三套，新鞋三雙。如行李重量有餘額則尚可携帶其他衣着及食品。昨天在滬江大學集中的日僑有帶了鍋子菜蔬自己在草塲上燒飯的有帶了麵包罐頭食物，合家坐在草地上大嚼的，表面上看這輩日人和過去在兆豐公園和虹口公園野餐的情形沒有什麼不同，不過昨天江邊的風是這樣凛冽襲人，這裏沒有笑聲，沒有歌聲。這不是野餐，這是回不了家的人，在離中國前末一次沉默的在荒塲上聚餐。</p>
<p>大半的日本人穿的衣服都很不差，第三方面軍吳宗澄上校陪了我走到草塲的盡頭，和一個穿西裝的日僑談了幾句。我問他：「你愛不愛回去？」他用英文回答說：「不回去怎麼樣？沒有事情做，沒有錢用，在上海如何能過活？」我又問他？「你家在那裏？」他說「我家在廣島？」他眼圈紅着，說不下去，我也不好意思再往下問。過了一回，他自動地說：「我母親女人全在廣島，不知怎樣了：聽說一個原子彈已將廣島整個轟燬？…我母親女人不知怎樣了；」我走過去的時候滿心想問問他關於戰爭和「大東亞共榮圈」有什麼意見。問了幾句，談到廣島和原子彈，看他神氣恐怕對戰爭以後不會發生熱烈的興趣，「我又何必在這時候問這「喪家之犬」他門答不了的問題？</p>
<p>然而在上海的日本人做了這多年的「天之驕子」，畢竟沒有受過什麼苦。在滬江大學草地上的羣衆，沒有面黃肌瘦的。沒有衣服襤褸不堪的。他們今天上午乘「明優丸」回到炸平了的廣島去，炸燬了的東京去，亦得看看戰爭到底是什麼，亦得警一番　武者的苦果。在薄暮籠罩了滬江校園，我車駛出校門的時候，我不禁想想這輩做過上海「主人翁」的人們，此次如此回去，他們內心究意如何想？（平爾）</p>

<h3>英巨型民航機環球飛行抵滬</h3>
<p>〔英新聞處訊〕由蘭開夏式機改造之VM七〇一洗綫型客機，現正作環繞世界之飛行，刻已行抵上海。</p>

<p>該機如用於運輸，能載四十八，目前此機可於日間載客九人，晚間可睡六人。機上有廚房及便利旅客之一切設備。</p>
<p>二月以前第一架蘭開夏式民航機，曾試飛拉丁美洲，刻英海外航行公司正計劃大量製造此式飛機，以爲民航之用。原來之　開夏機最宜於作戰，曾擊沉德戰艦特爾比茲號，並炸毀坎德大　。三月以前，非武裝之該機曾自加拿大起飛，作不着陸飛行，經北極至紹甫郡，全程四千哩。此次航行，開對於促進民航機一點，亦有重大關係。</p>
<p>機上旅客中，有英空軍運輸總部高級官員費連蒙空軍少將。渠曾統帶英運輸輔助隊，負責運輸第六英空運師，至諾曼地，後曾參與安亭之戰，及强渡萊茵諸役</p>

<h3>社會服務　房屋租賃　管理規則質疑</h3>
<p>— 上子</p>
<p>關於房屋租賃管理規則上海市房屋租金標準等辦法，業已於十一月二十五日公布。今後本市房屋租貸纠紛，可得一合理解決，惟本市現有無數二房東與三房客未解決之租賃纠紛，該規則是否包括此項關係在內，不得而知。衆所欲質疑者，的有兩點：</p>
<p>一，該規則是否包括二房東與三房客之關係在內。二，以上關係對該規則引用之商榷如后：</p>
<p>一，第二條，不遵向委員會登記，無享受規則之權利。是否影響到民法上之租賃關係的權利義務。</p>
<p>一，第十一條，出租人非因左列情事之一者，不得終止租賃。第五項，承租人專爲改良裝置而分租房屋，其所取租金，超過原租金之比例百分之三十者。所謂「改良裝置」，不知指何種程度而言，如住房隔間，搭擱樓等已數見不鮮，而營業房屋分租之改良裝置尤多。第六項，收回自用，經委員會證明者。果確有其事實，二房東是否有收回自用之樓（民法上無此規定，二房東收回，無非欲增加使用，是否有侵害他人生活之疑，值得研究，）而三房客與二房東地位，均係房屋承租人，值此屋少人多，小　未澈底消滅以前，是否適合實際情形，不無疑問。</p>
<p>一，第十一條，第五項規定，不得超過原租金之比例百分之三十，是否即爲二房東之法定利潤，抑不加限制。</p>
<p>（按）上述各點，確與多數人有切身關係，請房屋租賃管理委員會來函說明。</p>

<h3>車中險遇</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>有許多朋友問起，到內地去是不是眞眞有危險和困難。這一件事說來話長，同時也不能一槪而論，有時候運氣好平安渦去，運氣壞的時候，那就難說了。</p>
<p>我携妻挈子從上海到重慶去，一共費了三十三天工夫，沒有碰到甚麼意外，可算萬幸，也是走得非常順利的。但是回轉頭來一想，危險也不是沒有。</p>
<p>從上海到南京的火車上，有一位穿西裝的靑年跟我攀談起來。他問我到那裏去，我故意撒了一個謊，說是到天津去。冷不防他接下去突然間道，「上海到天津車票多少錢？」這一問可把我考倒了。我從上海到蚌埠，怎麼說得出到天津的票價？因此我祗好改變話鋒，說我先到蚌埠去找一位親戚，再轉到天津去。因此滬津票價多少，我不曉得。　我非常懷疑這位靑年是敵僞所派的特務一類的人物，專在車上調查於客的身份和行踪的，於是我趕快設法避開，不再與他交談。</p>
<p>我知道有一位五十餘歲的女太太因爲身上有一張紙條寫着從上海到重慶的路程，結果被日本憲兵扣留了三四小時。我們幸虧沒有碰到這一類的事。</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>肺前幾天聖藥塞的靈</h3>
<p>— 匡雪波</p>
<p>自從報上揭載美國發明肺癆特效藥『塞的靈』的消息後，一般肺癆患者。已像一羣已經判決死刑的人犯，突然獲得太赦的消息，都感到極度的興奮；有些病人甚至於暫時屛除計劃中預備施行的治療。更有許多神經過敏的患者，連正在進行中的合理的治撩也驟然停止，引長了頭頸專等那聖藥『塞的靈』降臨。</p>
<p>可是，這裏有一個使許多病家十分掃興的消息：我有一個同學剛從美國回來，他是去年由政府選派出國研究醫學的，因此對於美國的醫藥情形相當　悉。據他所知，『塞的靈』撲滅結核菌的效力，在試驗管中，成績的確驚人。就是對動物的試驗，成績也十分美滿。可是實騐到人體時，因爲該藥對於人體的毒性太重，結果得到不良的影響。醫學家現在正在想盡方法，去減輕毒性。大槪成功的希望極大，只是成功之期，一時還不能確定，無論如何，最短期內是不會實現的。　其實，不要說『塞的靈』還沒有成功，就是成功後，其他合理的治療術也決不能立刻屛去不用的。因爲器官一旦損毀，無論何種聖藥都無法加以補復。說得通俗一點，新六〇六，大家知道是療梅聖藥，可是患梅毒的若開了天窗，六〇六決不能把那缺了的鼻子重新補起來。再以肺癆來說，若肺中已有空洞，就說『塞的靈』立刻可以撲滅癆菌，但它對於這空洞還是毫無帮助，要肺部收縮，一定還要借重現在洗行的壓縮治療法，如人工氣胸等。因此，若給相當距離以外的過度光明耀花了眼睛，便隨便停止合理的治療，這很可能使病惡化而留給日後無盡的追悔，實在是一件大大錯誤的事。雖然這一段話暫時使許多可憐的肺癆患者感到失望，可是我相信這對於他們疾病的本身多少是有帮助的。</p>
<h3>談書（二）</h3>
<p>— 未風</p>
<p>恩尼派爾的書</p>
<p>一塲劇烈的戰事才過，有一位英國軍官被邀到美軍戰塲上去參觀；這時戰死者的屍身尚未全部　走，他看見了死者還緊握着個鋒的　隻，不禁嘆道：「勇士們！勇士們！」</p>
<p>「勇士們」便成了恩尼派爾第二本關於戰爭報告的書名；第一本時做：「這是你們的戰爭」。這兩本是這次大戰中，美國出版的煨有名的報文學，幾乎是家備一册，人手一篇的。現在爲了便於携帶，這兩本又被刪節了一些，合編爲一本，定名『大兵」。</p>
<p>恩尼派兩是專門報導士兵生活的戰地記者，瘦瘦的個子，禿頭。他與大兵一同生活，把他們的話忠實的記下來；由於觀察的銳敏，文筆的自然而流暢，他很快的便成爲美國人民家喩戶曉的人物。在今年四月，他在大琉球附近的伊江島上觀戰，被日軍偸擊致死。當時美國報紙曾把他與羅斯福總統並提，稱爲「在一個月中逝世的兩大人物」。他的書，即使在戰後，還是值得一讀的。</p>
<p>談話</p>
<h3>復員非易事夢谷</h3>
<p>— 夢谷</p>
<p>中國的教育復員，千頭萬緒，最近教育部長朱家驊談到中國敎育問題的嚴重，舉出一個例子來。他說全國的小學敎師計共六十六萬數千人，其中正式由師範學校畢業的，祇有六千多人，。師資檢定合格的祇有四分之一經這就是說，全中國的小學敎師中，有四分之三是要不得的。</p>
<p>他又提到內地各大學的遷校復校問題，他說武漢大學原來的校舍已不够用，補充和裝修就需要國幣十四萬萬元，浙江大學建造校舍需要十三萬萬元。上海兆豐公園對面的中央研究院裝修起來也需要一萬萬元。</p>
<p>我們覺得當政諸公如果能將他們實際的困難向民衆公開佈露，一定可以得到各方面更大的諒解與贊助，對於政務的推進可得，到不少的便利。</p>

<h3>敵人（The　Enemy）　（十二）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺</p>
<p>廚子和園丁都是在貞雄的父親手裏就做起的，那時貞雄還是一個小孩子，而弓子則是爲了孩子們而哭的。她非常憂戚，走了以後又跑回花子面前來。　「如果今晚孩子們一定要找我的話，你可以來叫我。我是回自已家裏去的，你知道在什麼地方。」</p>
<p>花子微笑着說：「謝謝你，」可是她心裏却說，無論孩子們怎樣哭法，她都不會去叫她的。</p>
<p>她燒早飯，貞雄帮着管孩子。兩人除了說到傭人已經走了以外，絕口不提這事。不過等花子將早飯拿給那俘虜後，她走到貞雄面前。</p>
<p>她問道：「爲什麼我們看不淸楚我們所該做的事？連傭人都看得比我們淸楚。爲什麼我們和其他的日本人不同？」</p>
<p>貞雄沒有回答。可是稍等一會以後，他走進那俘虜所在的房間，粗魯地說：「今天你可以起來走走了。我要你一次祇起來五分鐘。明天你可以起來十分鐘。你要儘可能快的來恢復你的氣力才好。」</p>
<p>他看見那還是十分蒼白的年輕的臉上，閃爍着的恐怖。　那陔子低聲說：「好的。」他顯然是想再多講些。「醫生，我覺得我該感謝你救了我的命。」</p>
<p>貞雄冷冷地說：「不要謝得太早了。」他又在那孩子的眼睛裏看見了那恐怖的閃爍——正像野獸的恐怖一樣地明顯。他頸上的創痕有一會兒要得血紅。這些創痕！它們是什麼？貞雄沒有問。</p>
<p>到了下午，又發生了第二件事。花子正做着那些不習慣的工作，做得很辛苦，看見一個穿制服的傳令兵走來，她的手都軟了，呼吸也困難起來。那些傭人一定已經去報告過了。她跑到貞雄那裏，喘息着說不出一個字來。但是這時那傳令兵却祇跟着她穿過花園，站在那裏。她無可奈何地指着他，沒有說什麼話。</p>
<p>貞雄正在看書，抬起頭來。他是在他的辦公室裏，辦公室的外面一部分向着花園，可以照到朝南的陽光。</p>

<h3>Reception Personnel Return to Changchun; Song Ziwen to Fly to Beiping for Personal Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Zhang Jia'ao and Jiang Jingguo are scheduled to depart for Changchun on the 4th. Zhang stated that this trip is to discuss with the Soviet side the technical aspects of the national army's airlift and administrative handover procedures. Xiong Shihui will also travel to Changchun in the coming days. Furthermore, Wang Qingmao, Chief of Staff of the 13th Air Force Area Command, and 14 others flew to Jinzhou on the 2nd to take over the airport. The suggestion that I proposed about industrial and mining rights and the navigation rights of the Songhua River is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Chen Yanjiong, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications for the Northeast, Chen Gongliang, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance for the Northeast, and their party flew to Beiping on the morning of the 3rd and will transfer to Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 3rd] Central government officials responsible for receiving the Nine Northeastern Provinces, who had suddenly withdrawn from Changchun two weeks ago, are now preparing to return to Changchun, as the situation appears to be clarifying, to carry out handover work with the Soviet occupation forces. Song Ziwen, Premier of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the newly established Supreme Economic Council, will arrive here today or tomorrow to confer with senior officials of the Nine Northeastern Provinces on handover matters and to provide personal instructions to ensure compliance with the recent Sino-Soviet understandings reached in Chongqing. Jiang Jingguo, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the Nine Northeastern Provinces, and Zhang Jia'ao, Special Commissioner for Economic Affairs, arrived here from Chongqing late yesterday. They met with officials of the Northeast Headquarters and the chairmen of the Nine Northeastern Provinces that evening. If the weather is clear tomorrow, Jiang and Zhang will fly to Changchun with the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing, accompanied by several financial and economic advisors. Jiang stated that after arriving in Changchun, he would discuss with Soviet Military Commander General Malinovsky the method of airlifting the central army to the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The method of transferring political affairs in the Nine Northeastern Provinces is also on the agenda. Fifty mining special commissioners, engineers, and technicians are also currently in Beiping. The Fushun coal mine near Shenyang, the largest coal deposit in Asia, will be taken over by them. It is estimated that the Nine Northeastern Provinces have a total of 200 billion tons of coal and 20 billion tons of iron, with the Fushun coal mine being the richest in reserves.</p>
<h3>National Army Approaches Shenyang; Elders in Jinzhou Accuse the "Road-Destroying Army" of Crimes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] The vanguard of the National Army has reached a location 90 li from Shenyang. Airlifted troops will begin entering the Nine Northeastern Provinces next week.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] It is reported that more than 500,000 leather coats and winter uniforms have been shipped to Beiping for use by the National Army heading to the Northeast. The Beiping area is prepared to dispatch troops on a large scale to the Northeast as soon as orders are given.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jinzhou, 3rd] General Du Yuming, the Northeast Security Commander, is only 42 years old, short and energetic. He fought alongside American General Stilwell in the India-Burma-Yunnan theater and is a world-renowned hero. Du entered newly recovered Jinzhou today and established his headquarters. The people of the city lined the streets to cheer, displaying great enthusiasm. Jinzhou is a semi-Chinese, semi-Japanese industrial city with a population of 200,000. Elders emerged from their mud houses, where they had lived for generations, to complain about the suffering endured during the two months of occupation by the disorderly troops. They stated, "We could barely survive for 14 years under Japanese occupation, but two months under the control of the 'Road-Destroying Army' (those who destroy roads) was too long." The disorderly troops robbed the residents of food and livestock, seizing everything they wanted. The Soviet troops who came here two months ago to disarm the Japanese forces did the same. The 40,000 disarmed Japanese soldiers, disheveled and barefoot, were full of awe towards the Chinese soldiers. Meanwhile, General Du's troops continued to advance northeast of Jinzhou, progressing 45 li today without encountering any resistance. According to General Du, the disorderly troops kidnapped the puppet provincial governor of Jinzhou and all the railway officials as hostages when they retreated yesterday, and their whereabouts are unknown. Du frankly hopes to reach Harbin within a month, and the "Road-Destroying Army" may collapse within two months. The "Road-Destroying Army" had obstructed transportation between Soviet troops and the Great Wall, but now national troops have landed on the south side of this area and will strengthen protection. The "Road-Destroying Army" broke through the national army's defenses 45 li south of here, disrupting traffic for four days. A force of 2,000 from the "Road-Destroying Army" clashed with a unit of the national army for a full day and night, resulting in 70 casualties for the "Road-Destroying Army" and 10 deaths for the national army. According to news from Shenyang, the Soviet army withdrew on the 10th of last month, and the "Road-Destroying Army" moved in and began looting and destroying factories to prevent them from being used by the national army.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Rages in the Suburbs of Baotou; National Army Enters Suburbs of Tianjin; Security Consolidated; Most of the Communist Troops near Tangshan Come to Their Senses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 3rd] The Northeast Communist Army suddenly shelled the city walls around 3:00 AM on the 3rd. Within 50 li of Baotou's suburbs, fighting continued on the afternoon of the 3rd. [Central News Agency, Suixi, 3rd] At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the Communist Army, along with dozens of armed Japanese artillerymen and over 20 mountain guns, concentrated their firepower from the Huangcaowa area, about 5 li west of Baotou, launching a fierce attack on the west and northwest gates of the city. Simultaneously, over 10,000 infantrymen stormed the west gate. Several sections of the northwest wall of Baotou were breached, but the National Army and civilians bravely resisted and patched the breaches. Although the Communist Army launched 14 or 15 consecutive assaults, they failed to succeed. Around 4:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the Communist Army retreated in defeat. However, their subsequent troops are rushing to Baotou to reinforce them, and a fierce battle is still raging. [Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Military news: In the past 48 hours, the National and Communist armies have engaged in the fiercest bloody battle of the current civil war in snow-covered Baotou. Elite Communist suicide squads, using Japanese weapons and aided by Japanese artillery units, armored vehicles driven by Japanese personnel, and pro-Communist Mongolian cavalry units, are launching a final assault on Baotou. The government claims that Baotou has been surrounded by the Communist army since November 8, but since the 1st of this month, the government has dispatched powerful Hui Muslim cavalry to surround the Communist army from the outside. According to a wireless message received indirectly from Baotou, the defending troops in Baotou are running out of ammunition, with only 500 American carbines. The Communist army is now under attack from all sides. The 12th War Area's wireless broadcast stated that the Communist army's total collapse is not far off. The current battle zone is within 48 li around Baotou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] Security in the suburbs of Tianjin is becoming increasingly consolidated. The National Army has entered Wangqingtuo, Shuangkou, Hanliucun, and other towns on the 2nd. Wangqingtuo and Shuangkou are both located northwest of Tianjin, 40 to 50 li from the city. Hanliucun is located in the northern suburbs and is a place where bandits frequently appear. The National Army entered Wangqingtuo and Shuangkou via Yangliuqing on the Jinpu Railway on the 2nd. Order in these three towns is gradually being restored, and the people are returning to their homes to live and work in peace. Most of the Communist troops near Tangshan have come to their senses and are defecting to the National Army, where they are being treated favorably.</p>
<h3>Examination Committee Discovers Forged Documents from Candidates; Transferred to Judicial Authorities for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The Examination Committee, recently reviewing applications and examining the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate examinations, higher examinations, and ordinary examinations, discovered that 15 applicants had submitted forged or altered documents. The committee has transferred all related documents to the judicial authorities for investigation. In the future, if similar situations are encountered by examination authorities in other provinces (cities), they will also be transferred to the local judicial authorities for investigation to eliminate malpractices and serve as a warning to others.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Regarding the student strike at Southwest Associated University in Kunming in response to the anti-civil war movement, the Central Daily News here reported that five students were seriously injured and eight were slightly injured when 30 Communist members or sympathizers forced the strike. The newspaper also stated that all but 20% of the students have resumed classes. Leftists are spreading propaganda claiming that students are striking to oppose the civil war and that the government is using force to suppress demonstrations. Government authorities have strongly denied this. The government side declared that this is the work of "conspirators" attempting to use pure students to achieve their ambition of overthrowing the government, and they are even resorting to coercive force in an attempt to maintain the strike. The newspaper also stated that some students in Kunming are vigorously supporting the government and have issued a telegram calling on the Kuomintang to suppress the actions of the rebels, unify the nation's political and military commands, eliminate all "conspirators" who exploit students, and eradicate all "rogue intellectuals." Meanwhile, 67 professors from various universities in Kunming have jointly issued a declaration, stating that the strike was orchestrated by conspirators.

<h3>Sixteen Cultural Organizations in Chongqing Issue a Joint Declaration on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Sixteen cultural organizations in Chongqing, including the Chinese Writers' Association, have recently issued a joint declaration on the current situation. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The eight years of the War of Resistance were the most sacred and arduous. Our compatriots shed their blood and sacrificed their lives. Those who were weak contributed their strength, and those who had no money contributed their resources. They left their homes and abandoned their wives and children. We endured all the suffering of wartime. We have endured it for eight years. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, will we not be allowed to enjoy peace? Must we continue to endure suffering? The people are weary; they deserve a respite. We demand peace; we oppose internal strife. Whoever starts internal strife is our enemy. During this War of Resistance, our country suffered the greatest destruction in its history. How many prosperous cities and towns have been turned into scorched earth? How many emerging factories are left with only rubble? How much brilliant culture has been turned into ashes?</p>
<p>To Build a Great Unified Nation</p>
<p>Now that we have won, will we not be allowed to rebuild our homeland on the ruins of destruction? Will we not be allowed to rebuild our homes on the dilapidated walls? We demand life; we demand construction. Whoever prevents us from construction, whoever wants to destroy after destruction, is our enemy. Construction first, nation-building first. The nation we want to build is a great unified nation. Only a unified nation is a modern nation, and only a unified nation can shoulder the great task of nation-building.</p>
<p>We were able to become stronger through war and even became one of the five great powers. We can finally hold our heads high and speak our minds. How can we allow ourselves to be divided at this time, preventing the nation from becoming a modern nation and the people from becoming modern people? We support unification; we oppose division. Whoever creates division is our enemy.</p>
<p>Support Democracy and Demand the Rule of Law</p>
<p>After a great war, discipline and laws must be rectified. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, society underwent enormous changes. Without discipline and the rule of law, how can we restore social order and establish a democratic nation? Democracy goes hand in hand with the rule of law; without the rule of law, there is no democracy. We support democracy; we demand the rule of law. Those who disrupt discipline and the rule of law are the enemies of democracy and our enemies. Unfortunately, while we demand democracy, unification, peace, and construction, the Communist Party is engaged in a major rebellion against democracy, unification, peace, and construction.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Japan's surrender, the Communist Party disregarded the decisions of the Allied nations and the orders of the Supreme Commander. It arbitrarily issued the so-called Yan'an Headquarters Order, seeking the illegal right to accept the surrender. First, it independently advanced to accept the surrender; then, it obstructed and attacked the national army accepting the surrender; and then, it launched widespread attacks on the national army throughout the country. From Guangzhou to Guisui, there were instances of Communist troops besieging the national army everywhere. From the surrender to the present, there have been daily reports of Communist troops besieging and attacking cities and territories. What have the people done to deserve this slaughter? Where is the peace we hoped for? Railway construction has been destroyed. Where is the construction we hoped for? The Communist Party has established separatist rule, resembling feudalism. Where is the unification we demanded? The Communist Party opposes the convening of the National Assembly, resorting to military chaos instead of political struggle. Where is the democracy we demanded?</p>
<p>Promote the Communist Party to Stop Internal Strife</p>
<p>The Communist Party is also aware that this rebellion violates the demands of the people and is playing with terms and stealing names, trying to shirk its responsibility for internal strife, hoping to deceive the people of the world with one hand. They are also shouting for democracy to achieve their private goals of opposing the nation and the government, but they do not understand that democracy must have the rule of law and discipline. They are loudly shouting about their so-called "liberated areas" to cover up their separatist and divisive actions, without asking from whom they seized their so-called "liberated areas." They are also loudly shouting "oppose civil war" to win the sympathy of peace-loving people and to shirk their responsibility for starting internal strife, without asking whether the so-called "civil war" is actually caused by internal strife. Such hypocrisy only proves their growing anxiety. This rebellion is expanding. If the Communist Party persists in its own way and continues on the path of armed force, what will the people live on? What will the nation be?</p>
<p>We are all organizations dedicated to cultural work. We have the duty to expose conspiracies that steal names and disrupt right and wrong, and we also have the responsibility to reiterate the demands for democracy, unification, peace, and construction. We believe that there are many wise people in the Communist Party, and not all the people of the country can be deceived. If the members of the Communist Party are willing to be friends of the people, then please stop the internal strife or do not participate in it. This would be a great blessing for the nation and the people. If they are still unrepentant, it will not only be a great disaster for the nation and the people, but also a public enemy of the people of our country. Disaster! Blessing! Enemy! Friend! The decision now rests on the single thought of every member of the Communist Party. We wish to earnestly inform our compatriots and the members of the Communist Party of this. Chinese Writers Association, Chinese Inventors Association, Chinese National Fine Arts Association, Chinese Religious Fellowship Association, Chinese Catholic Cultural Association, Chinese Buddhist Society, Confucius Society, Life Philosophy Research Association, Youth Discussion Association, Chinese Psychological Construction Association, China National Sports Association, Chinese Know-Do Society, Chinese Border Association, Chinese Literary and Art Association, Chinese Overseas Enterprise Cultural Association, Chinese Youth Writers Association.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Zhao Cai Guild Hall, National Salvation Association, and other four organizations in Mexico City have all telegraphed Chairman Chiang requesting the suppression of the rebellion in order to uphold the national law and maintain the foundation of the nation.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Construction of the Changsha Water Dam</h3>
<p>—A Major Event in Chinese History</p>
<p>As the Political Consultative Conference is about to convene and the situation in the Northeast is showing signs of improvement, we must not easily overlook another very meaningful event in China's rebirth: the implementation of the Yangtze River water dam project. The U.S. authorities have signed a contract with the China Resources Commission, under which American engineers will draft plans to build an unprecedentedly grand concrete and steel dam on the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to control the water flow. This will save tens of millions of residents in the Yangtze River basin from the incessant floods and famines of the past centuries. It will also utilize water power to generate electricity. At the same time, it is planned to build several other water dams and dig thousands of miles of canals for irrigation and other facilities. In the future, ocean-going ships will be able to sail directly to Chongqing. All planning will be supervised by American dam design expert, Savage. The development of this project will take 25 years and includes the world's largest hydropower plant project.</p>
<p>The signing of this contract is a major event in Chinese history. Although the Yangtze River is not necessarily "China's sorrow," the flooding of the river is sometimes enough to cause countless people to suffer. What is most regrettable is that such a large river, with such great water power, has not been utilized in the past, causing us to waste the special favor that nature has given us. Now that the United States has signed a contract with us to develop water conservancy, this will not only enable the Yangtze River basin to avoid droughts and floods, but also provide us with a large amount of cheap power, laying a solid foundation for our country's industrialization. At the same time, it will increase the throughput of Yangtze River shipping, allowing ocean-going ships to sail upstream to Sichuan, sweeping away the past lament of the so-called "difficulty of the Shu Road." Although the complete success of this project will require a relatively long period, once it is successful, the entire face of China will be completely changed. China will leap from the stage of handicraft industry to an electrified society. The signing of this contract is indeed a major event in the process of building a new China!</p>
<p>In the process of nation-building, the full utilization of water power is the most basic and most important thing. Before implementing the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union first paid attention to water power, building a huge dam on the Dnieper River. By using the water power of the Dnieper River, it generated a huge amount of power, and then was able to launch its industrial development plan. The manufacture of the atomic bomb relied on the so-called TVA's large amount of cheap electricity, transportation equipment, and industrial equipment. We are now embarking on the road of nation-building, and the core of future nation-building is industrialization, and industrialization requires power. Therefore, our first step is to utilize the water power of the Yangtze River, which can be said to have laid an excellent cornerstone for my country's industrialization and nation-building project.</p>
<p>Moreover, the utilization of the Yangtze River's water power is not limited to providing us with the power necessary for industrialization. Using water power to generate power is only one aspect of utilizing water power; its main purpose is how to control the natural water force to benefit mankind. From the very beginning, mankind knew how to use water to benefit mankind. People in the Neolithic Age knew the benefits of irrigating the Rong River. Li Bing of our Qin Dynasty used the water of the Min River in Sichuan to create agricultural benefits for the Chengdu Plain. Even today, the Dujiangyan irrigation system in Guanxian is still praised by the world. Even Savage, who plans to utilize the Yangtze River's water conservancy, greatly admires it. However, the modern use of water power is still a recent event. This is the great plan of the "Tennessee Valley Authority" (TVA) established by President Roosevelt when he implemented the New Deal. The Tennessee River Valley used to be the most barren area in the United States. Since the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority, with the utilization of the entire Tennessee River as the target, the barren land has been transformed into a prosperous one. Electrification has been realized, and agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, and social welfare have all been expanded, becoming a typical democratic experimental area, creating a new situation for the world.</p>
<p>Savage, who is planning to utilize the Yangtze River's water conservancy, was the designer of the water conservancy in the Nasco River. It is said that the full utilization of the Yangtze River will surpass the TVA in the future and become the only water conservancy area in the world. A few days ago, news from the United States said that the original plan would be scaled down. Whether the contract signed by the United States now is the original plan, the telegrams are vague, and we cannot know. But whether it is the original plan or the revised plan, the signing of this contract undoubtedly clearly indicates that our government is determined to utilize the water power of the Yangtze River. When implementing this plan, many fields and graves may have to be destroyed, which may encounter the resentment of the people, and even the obstruction of some powerful parties. But under the major premise of national welfare, we must all endure all minor sacrifices.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot help but have renewed feelings. After a long period of war, the country has decided to start anew with the people, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and start with the utilization of the Yangtze River's water conservancy. This shows the government's determination to build the country. However, there are those who destroy national interests, raise troops and cause chaos, and attempt to obstruct the great cause of nation-building. Our people will not allow the victory work of nation-building to be hindered again. In the utilization of the Yangtze River's water conservancy, we see the rebirth of the nation. We hope that this rebirth will become a reality, so that China can achieve the ideal state of strength, prosperity, and happiness.</p>
<h3>Incident at the United Nations Normal College: Hand Grenade Incident</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 2nd] According to reporters' inquiries, the hand grenade incident at the United Nations Normal College was caused by a fight between students of the United Nations University and a small number of cadets from the Second Military Officers Corps. The details are as follows: (1) A team of cadets from the Second Military Officers Corps went to Daguan Building to visit on the 30th in accordance with regulations. When passing by the United Nations University, some students in the school suddenly threw mud, tiles, and stones at the team, and shouted insults. The team initially avoided by leaning against the wall, but the stone throwing became more intense, so they fought back, and more than a dozen people on each side were injured. (2) The cadets who were insulted for no reason were filled with resentment. They submitted articles to various newspapers on the same day, but they were not published, which increased their anger. They gathered more than 30 people and went to the United Nations Normal College at about 11:00 am on the 1st to question the students of the college, resulting in a conflict. At that time, a jobless soldier, Chen Yunzeng, broke in, carrying several hand grenades. During the fight, he threw them at the college, injuring 13 people. Four of them were seriously injured and sent to Yunda Hospital for treatment, but later died. Other lightly injured students are being treated in the hospital. (3) A hand grenade throwing incident also occurred at the Liberal Arts College of the United Nations University at the same time, but no one was injured. It is now learned that the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters has arrested the perpetrator Chen Yunzeng and one suspect at the Liberal Arts College. They will be publicly tried and severely punished according to law tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Routine Meeting to be Held in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Regarding the matter of returning the capital, the highest authorities gave instructions last Monday that the Executive Yuan and its subordinate ministries and commissions could first send a part of their personnel to Nanjing to work. The date of the official return to the capital will be decided after the restoration work is completed. After the routine meeting last Tuesday, the Executive Yuan discussed specific measures based on this instruction and decided: (1) The Executive Yuan and its subordinate ministries and commissions will send a part of their personnel to Nanjing according to actual needs. The number of personnel in each ministry and commission will vary. The maximum number will be 150 for ministries such as Finance and Transportation, and the minimum number will be only 10 for commissions such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, for a total of 1,500 people. (2) All personnel must arrive in Nanjing before December 15th. (3) The routine meeting of the Executive Yuan will be moved to Nanjing. Chen Kewen, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, went to Beijing a few days ago to survey the buildings, furniture, and food and lodging problems of the various ministries and commissions. He has now returned. According to him, the addresses of the various ministries and commissions have been roughly decided. The Executive Yuan will temporarily use the old Ministry of Railways for office. Most of the ministries and commissions are located at their original sites. A small number of ministries and commissions and those established after the Anti-Japanese War will temporarily share offices with the Executive Yuan. Chen said that his impression of Nanjing is not desolate but quiet. Thanks to the efforts of the municipal authorities, the city appearance has been restored, and there are no security problems in the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to the Executive Yuan, from the beginning of October to November 30th, a total of 784 personnel and 10 tons of public goods were transported by air under the control of the Executive Yuan. The important personnel for the reception in the Peiping-Tientsin area have been largely transported. Since December 1st, civil aviation has been opened. In the future, personnel going to Peiping should apply directly to the China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<h3>Marshall Deploys Matters to Fly to Chongqing: Must Attend Congress Twice Before Departure; Hurley's Statement Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] General Marshall, the new U.S. Ambassador to China, is busy deploying matters for flying to Chongqing to assume his post. However, before departure, he must attend Congress twice this week: once to testify before the Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee, and once to explain his mission to Chongqing to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in advance. [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to the U.S. Information Service's Washington dispatch of the 1st, members of both houses of the U.S. Congress are still concerned about the points made by former Ambassador to China Hurley accusing State Department foreign service personnel. Congressman Rogers introduced a bill requesting Bernays to hand over all information about undermining U.S. policy toward China to Congress. Senator Willis gave a speech in the Senate criticizing U.S. policy toward the Far East, requesting the State Department to clarify it and to rectify its internal affairs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Congressman Mundt, a member of the Committee on Un-American Activities, announced today that the committee will conduct a thorough investigation of the State Department after hearing Hurley's accusations. It is said that Hurley has made accusations against communists in the American diplomatic community. We will use this as a basis for investigation. We want to know who the communists Hurley is referring to are. How did they hinder U.S. foreign policy, and what methods did they use? We hope Hurley can answer. If Hurley's accusations are limited to the current people, then our investigation will be limited to these people. However, if other State Department personnel are included, the scope of the investigation will also be expanded. I personally believe that there are pro-communist elements among the lower-level personnel of the State Department who are hindering foreign policy. We have discovered that reports from overseas are deliberately altered and embellished by these communist believers before being submitted to senior State Department officials. I suspect that the reports made by Ambassador Hurley may have been altered by these people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] A government spokesman believes that the Republican Party is using Ambassador to China Hurley's resignation to stir up a debate on foreign policy.</p>

Trucks equipped with biogas are equivalent to ten gallons of gasoline. It takes three minutes to pump gas with a gas pump. Experts say that biogas will soon be made into a very useful liquid.</p>

<h3>The Three Major Economic Spheres Under Today's World Phenomena</h3>
<p>Communism, which had a strong momentum before the war, is now inferior to socialism after the war</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] According to an article by a special correspondent of the New York Times, the phenomenon of today's world, from an economic point of view, can be divided into three major parts: (1) Capitalism; (2) Semi-capitalism; (3) Communism, with the United States, Western Europe, and the Soviet Union as their respective centers. These three categories may soon be found to be inadequate, as China, India, and even South America may not fit into any of them. However, in the immediate future, this classification still seems appropriate, as these three different economic societies will seek ways to trade with each other and with the rest of the world. Great Britain is a non-capitalist society and is now evolving. The British Labour Party has not only never suggested nationalizing all industries, but also does not want to do so. It not only does not want to establish a totalitarian economic system, but also strongly opposes this ideal. Its purpose is only to fight against private monopolies and restrictions on production and employment. The reason for taking over several industries and controlling the monopoly habits of various industries still in private hands is nothing more than to achieve this goal. The British Labour Party's policy is not semi-communism, but a completely different democratic plan policy to achieve the goals of a democratic socialist party. The countries of Scandinavia are indeed the same. If Britain's experiment is successful, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy will follow in Britain's footsteps. If the aforementioned democratic socialist policies are successful, the countries of Western Europe will not attempt communist economic policies. If the three parties can approach the problems with good faith, the above three different systems can have good trade relations. There is only one thing that can force Western Europe to abandon the trial of democratic socialist plans and turn to communist policies in the near future, that is, the United States places various obstacles in the way of the former two policies, making them feel that only the latter policy is their only feasible way out. It must be known that Western Europe now wants to reverse its tide and return to controlled flame capitalism, which is impossible in the current situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] A New York Times reporter wrote that the development of socialism has obviously exceeded the expectations of prophets. A year or even half a year ago, political commentators believed that the moderate revolutionaries of Marxism would inevitably succumb to the radical communism backed by the Soviet Union. The lion once loved the sheep. If communism and socialism could form an alliance, the political control would inevitably fall into the hands of this powerful group. The dictatorship of the proletariat could then be established. Reactionary forces, privileged classes, and neo-fascism would inevitably bow their heads. However, the evolution of the matter has been unexpected. Communism has not only failed to form a united front with socialism, but has instead been in a state of civil war. Communism has not only failed to gradually strengthen and absorb socialism, but the public has instead tended towards socialism. France, Italy, the Netherlands, and even Germany, Austria, and the former satellite countries have all become the domain of socialists. The current government of Britain is also a socialist government. The social democratic parties and peasant parties in Central Europe may also belong to the socialist faction. Communism, before the war, had a strong momentum, but after the war, the lion was no match for the sheep.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>A Portion of the Ministry of Education Staff Decides to Choose Nanjing to Work First.</h3>
<p>Vice Minister Hang Liwu Will Go to Nanjing and Shanghai to Supervise the Restoration</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Since Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua returned from his inspection, he has been actively promoting the restoration of education in the recovered areas. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and a portion of the staff will first take a plane to Nanjing to work. Vice Minister Hang Liwu will soon go to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas to supervise the restoration of education in the recovered areas. As for the puppet teachers and staff, they must be strictly screened. Even those who were conscripted as a last resort must be strictly screened. Those who fail the screening will not be allowed to work in the education field in the future. Those who have participated in underground work and have conclusive evidence of anti-Japanese actions will not be subject to this restriction. Those few people who are temporarily conscripted as a last resort will not be hired for tutoring classes, so these personnel do not have the qualifications of tutoring class teachers and are not even teachers in any university. Even those puppet school teachers and staff who have passed the screening can only indicate that they have the qualifications to serve in the education field, and should not be considered as officially hired. Therefore, in the future, each university will not be subject to any restrictions regarding the hiring of professors.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Students Going to the United States are Stranded in New Delhi. Commissioner Xue is Negotiating with the U.S. Side.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 1st Dispatch] Thirteen women, two children, and fifty students from our country who were en route to the United States are now stranded here. The U.S. military has prohibited non-military passengers from boarding U.S. ships. This measure was implemented without prior knowledge by all parties. It is obviously due to complaints from U.S. soldiers, who believe that the delay in the return of the military is due to the Water Transport Bureau giving priority to non-military personnel. After contacting various groups, Xue Shouheng, the acting commissioner of China stationed in India, decided to consult with the U.S. commissioner stationed in India on the current situation on the 1st. This measure not only affects Chinese students, but also 150 Indians preparing to go to the United States to participate in the State Department's cultural program. In the future, the right of priority for boarding ships will be determined by the representative of the U.S. State Department here.</p>
<p>The Commissioner's Office confirmed the cancellation of the priority for non-military passengers to board U.S. ships and planes, and currently has no way to assist students stranded in Calcutta. It is reported that diplomatic and government personnel and their families are not subject to the ban. The provision that 300 non-military civilians from the China region and the India-Burma region could obtain fourth-class priority each month has been cancelled as a result. If this method also applies to the China region, then the only way for Chinese students stranded in India to be sent is to take a ship to Shanghai and then take a ship to the United States when commercial ships resume sailing.</p>

<h3>National Institute for Compilation and Translation</h3>
<p>— Wu Hongzhi</p>
<p>The poet Bai Juyi once chanted in "The Song of Everlasting Regret", "The Shu River is blue, and the Shu Mountains are green." The Jialing River from early winter to late spring confirms the realism of this poem. That kind of blue and green is so lovely that it is hard to imagine and even harder to describe.</p>
<p>The National Institute for Compilation and Translation is located on the west bank of the Jialing River. This is a large-scale cultural and academic institution. It has been growing steadily during the arduous eight-year war of resistance." On the one hand, it pays tribute to many cultural and academic warriors who fought hard on the line of hunger and cold and firmly guarded their posts; on the other hand, it also shows that the country attaches importance to cultural and academic work during the war as it does in peacetime.</p>
<p>The institute is divided into six groups: Natural Science Group, Humanities Group, Textbook Group, Education Group, Social Science Group, and General Affairs Group, which is responsible for the administrative affairs of the entire institute; in addition, there are many committees, such as the Translation Committee, the University Textbook Committee, and the Place Name Unification Committee. A library with the richest collection of books in the rear is also part of it.</p>
<p>The staff, including clerks and stewards, consists of more than 180 people. Their work includes the compilation and review of national textbooks for primary and secondary schools from time to time; the unified Chinese and foreign terms for physics, chemistry, and other subjects that have been completed; the medical and pharmaceutical terms and geographical terms that are about to be completed; the secondary encyclopedic dictionaries that are urgently needed by young people; the educational encyclopedia that is being compiled; the twenty-four histories that are being sorted out; the world-famous works of philosophy, literature, history, etc. that are being translated; and the textbooks for various university subjects that are being written. All are written by experts, and there are also experts outside the institute who are specially commissioned to write them. In the future, when the country's material construction moves forward, cultural construction will also develop rapidly. When printing conditions improve, the achievements of the National Institute for Compilation and Translation will inevitably be recognized by people across the country, and the work will be even more arduous.</p>
<p>In a row of long black houses, under the windows sheltered by tall, verdant banana trees, next to each table are some cultural warriors buried in their work. Many people from allied countries, after appreciating the scenery of the Jialing River, came to visit (and of course, many came specifically to visit) and were amazed that China, during the arduous war of resistance, not only had young students chanting, but also had such a large-scale cultural and academic institution. It seemed to be a great surprise. And the enemy's bombing at that time only destroyed a few small houses, but it could not cause major damage to this spiritual fortress, but it was very heavy on the enemy's "striking the striker". Now that victory is coming, I wish the National Institute for Compilation and Translation a limitless future.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Factories and Mines Resumption Loan: Government Approves 30 Billion Yuan, Stipulating Raw Materials as Collateral</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Exclusive Interview] Li Daonan, Manager of the Bank of Communications, told our newspaper reporter yesterday: The "Four Joint Offices" (Si Lian Chu) have allocated a loan of 30 billion yuan to aid the resumption of work for various factories and mines in Shanghai and assist the local factories' recovery. This sum is allocated by the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices" based on the "Implementation Measures for Shanghai Mining and Factory Resumption Loans" passed in Chongqing on the 29th of last month.</p>
<p>Shanghai Manufacturers' Loan Amounts</p>
<p>The Shanghai mining and factory loan applications that have been approved include: China Xing Coal Mine Company, 10 billion yuan; Shen Xin factories, 7 billion yuan; Wing On Textile Factory, 7 billion yuan; enemy-operated factories taken over by our side, 2.5 billion yuan; Jun Feng Textile Factory, 3 billion yuan; American-owned Shanghai Power Company, 5 billion yuan; American-owned Telephone Company, 200 million yuan; British-owned Water Company, 200 million yuan. In addition, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's loan application of 3 billion yuan has passed the review of the Shanghai branch and has been submitted to the Chongqing headquarters for approval.</p>
<p>Preventing Hoarding and Restricting Mortgages</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li, the sole objective of the "Four Joint Offices'" loan method is to enhance Shanghai's industrial production. Therefore, the loan terms are very strict. Factories intending to apply for resumption loans must first apply to the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices." The branch and the responsible authorities will conduct a joint review. Currently, textile factories and similar factories are reviewed by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, public utilities are reviewed by the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, and flour mills are reviewed by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food. After passing the review, the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices" will submit the application to the headquarters for approval. For factories borrowing smaller amounts, loans can be obtained from commercial banks, and the "Four Joint Offices'" branch can apply for rediscounting. Currently, to prevent hoarding, mining and factory applicants are only allowed to use raw materials as collateral and cannot use finished products. The annual interest rate on loans is 2% to 3.6%. According to Mr. Li, Shanghai factories urgently need assistance. Since the Shanghai branch of the "Four Joint Offices" started providing loans, the state of industry in Shanghai has shown improvement.</p>

It then went to Taiwan to transport prisoners of war back to England. This is its first visit to China, and it will regularly host reporters for visits.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Traffic Conditions</h3>
<p>After inspecting the reception of ships and instructing on the expansion of shipping, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications flew to Qingdao yesterday morning to inspect traffic conditions. According to sources from the Ship Allocation Committee, the procedures for returning privately owned ships require first applying to the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau. After the bureau investigates and confirms that the ship did not collaborate with the enemy, it will then consider the overall shipping situation and notify the National Ship Allocation Committee to return the ship.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Nazi Party Members Enter Jiangwan Concentration Camp</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Report] The Shanghai Municipal Government's German Residents Management Committee has concluded the registration process. The total number of registrants reached 2,400. As of yesterday, 187 Nazi Party members had been detained in the former Japanese Middle School concentration camp on Qimei Road in Jiangwan. All properties belonging to German residents without anyone to manage them have been sealed off. Others who have not registered are currently allowed to reside freely, pending the promulgation of regulations by the municipal government, after which they will be ordered to enter the camp.</p>
<h3>Eight Giant Ships Carrying Relief Supplies Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press] The cargo ship "Zhongshan," carrying the first batch of clothes, shoes, and medicines from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), is unloading at the docks here today. Other ships from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are also in the middle of washing, waiting to unload cargo. According to the planned schedule, one ship will arrive at a Chinese port every day before December 15th, and eight giant ships are currently unloading in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao Gradually Restore Communications</h3>
<p>Due to environmental limitations, the communication between Northern Jiangsu and Shanghai has not yet been restored. The situation in Northeast China is gradually improving due to the progress of Sino-Soviet negotiations. The communication between that area and Shanghai is currently transmitted through radio circuits, with Tianjin as the base point. Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao have gradually restored communications, and commercial telegrams have begun to be sent and received in Taipei.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo's Wife, Li Lizhuang, Escorted to Shanghai: Intended to Stay at the International Hotel but Ended Up in Detention</h3>
<p>Li Lizhuang, the wife of the traitor Chen Gongbo, was escorted off the "Ming Yu Maru" yesterday morning at 9:10 AM when the ship docked at the Qujiang Wharf from the Huangpu River, accompanied by American and Chinese military police, carrying seven pieces of luggage of various sizes. She was transported here from Japan by the American side and handed over to our government for processing. Chen Gongbo's wife was unable to accompany him when he was escorted back to the country due to illness.</p>
<p>Fellow Traitors</p>
<p>Li Lizhuang was the only woman among the thousand-plus overseas Chinese aboard the "Ming Yu Maru" this time. When the ship arrived at the Qujiang Wharf, reporters boarded the ship to meet with the traitor Li. She was monitored by an American lieutenant and "escorted" by a Japanese baojia (local security official). Three other traitors were traveling with her, all ruthless thugs who caused trouble on the ship several times. The traitor Li was held in a small cabin measuring six feet square, with the door tightly closed. It was only after the American military police knocked urgently that it was opened.</p>
<p>Two Faces</p>
<p>She appeared to be in her forties, wearing rimless glasses and light makeup. She wore a dark purple silk cheongsam with a cream-colored coat, matching leather shoes and stockings with the color of the coat. Her hair was tied in a chignon. She smiled when she saw people, but appeared embarrassed when she saw a photographer taking pictures. It is said that she suffered from dental disease along the way that has not yet recovered, but her spirits are still good. She boarded the ship in Fukuoka, Japan, and received good treatment along the way, including various vaccinations. She wore an expensive jade bracelet on her right hand and had a copy of "Life" magazine on her bed.</p>
<p>Attempted Bribery</p>
<p>According to Lieutenant Daves, the American official in charge, she was very wealthy, repeatedly giving Luzon cigars to the escorts and bribing Daves with $65 USD three times, all of which were rejected. The reporter asked, "What are your thoughts on returning to Shanghai this time?" Li replied, "I have mixed feelings. Let's talk about the future later." When asked, "Have you heard anything about the domestic situation in recent months? Do you have any news about your husband?" She replied, "I have been living in Japan for several months and know nothing about the domestic situation." The American soldiers on the ship called her "Madam." She also told reporters that she intended to ask the authorities for permission to stay at the International Hotel temporarily. Before she could finish speaking, she was escorted off the ship by Daves, the American escort officer, and several of his subordinates, armed with rifles, and taken directly to a military detention facility, where she was handed over to our side for processing.</p>

<h3>Association of Comrades Who Suffered During the War of Resistance Sends Telegram to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Please Suppress the Internal Disorder</p>
<p>The entire membership of the Shanghai Association of Comrades Who Suffered During the War of Resistance, in view of the Communist army defying laws and regulations, attacking the National Army, destroying transportation, and hindering the great cause of national construction, has sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, urging him to quickly suppress the rebellion in order to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<h3>Forty-Seven Factories to be Evaluated and Auctioned</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Zhejiang-Anhui Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs revealed that the 47 small factories to be publicly auctioned, as decided by the Enemy Property Handling Review Committee, have been classified and sorted out by the office. Recently, an Evaluation Committee will be established to determine the value. The committee will convene an evaluation meeting on the 6th of this month to auction them in batches based on price, so as to achieve production work as soon as possible and start the recovery process early.</p>
<h3>Military Police and Gendarmerie Cooperate to Strengthen Winter Security</h3>
<p>The security situation during the winter security period in the city is causing concern due to the fact that order has not been fully restored after the war. Our Central News Agency reporter interviewed the military, police, and gendarmerie agencies responsible for maintaining the city's security. According to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the headquarters has formulated concrete plans for winter security with the military, police, and gendarmerie, and has sufficient troops and police force to maintain security during the winter security period.</p>
<p>Increased Troops and Strengthened Security</p>
<p>In the urban area, the garrison headquarters has decided to increase the number of soldiers stationed at major transportation routes, starting immediately, to strengthen security forces. Secondly, the city will be divided into five districts, each with a patrol team organized by the military, police, and gendarmerie, working in shifts day and night to patrol the streets and public entertainment venues. As for security in the suburbs, it will be the responsibility of the military. The 88th Division and units of the 71st Army, which fought in Myanmar after defending Zhabei and Dachang for three months, have taken over the defense of the four suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>City Defense Committee Establishes Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>The reporter also visited the Volunteer Corps of the Shanghai City Defense Committee. The corps was established on the 16th of this month as a self-defense organization formed by local civilians, and will exert its self-defense power during the winter security period to assist the military, police, and gendarmerie in ensuring the city's security. According to General Corps Commander Rong Youlue, the corps has decided to divide the Shanghai urban area into eight districts: Pudong South District, and Pudong North District, and Wusong District, with a defense corps established in each district. The total number of people will be set at 10,000. Members will be divided into permanent members and volunteer members. Volunteer members will be merchants and civilians who automatically participate, and it is estimated that there will be 8,000 people in the city. Permanent members will be recruited by the corps, with a quota of 2,000 people.</p>
<h3>Investigating Enemy Atrocities, Settling Eight Years of Blood Debts</h3>
<p>This is a blood debt! We should present it as accurately as possible to the enemy for settlement! Since the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office was ordered to investigate enemy atrocities on the 6th of last month, the number of people registering has increased day by day, especially yesterday, when it exceeded 140. They seemed to treat the clerk as they would their own parents, pouring out the grief and pain that had been buried in their hearts for so long.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand how the enemy practiced "friendship" during these eight years. Besides torture, slaughter, occupation, arson, and rape, nothing else can be found. Every word and every sentence on the registration form is blood! It's all tears!</p>
<p>Although the number of people is large, Clerk Yu Tao is very kind, patiently asking questions in detail, which is commendable. As of yesterday, the total number of registered cases was over 500, of which three-quarters belonged to villagers in the suburbs, and only a small part belonged to the urban area. Is it possible that only these people in the urban area were victimized and ravaged?</p>
<p>The registration deadline is set for the 6th of this month, but it may be extended for a few days depending on the situation. This is to give the victimized citizens ample opportunity. It is hoped that they will quickly present this blood debt. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities will submit the investigation to the government immediately after the investigation is completed, and go to the enemy for settlement, so that these miserable people who have nowhere to turn and no home to return to can get some comfort and a result as soon as possible. Only then can they receive the warmth of victory.</p>
<h3>Lessons for Warmongers! Japanese Nationals Quietly Return Home: Gathered Yesterday, Leaving Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Special Feature) The first batch of repatriated Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University yesterday to prepare to board the "Ming Yu Maru" to return to Japan. The reporter made a special trip to see what the mood was like for these people from the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" who are returning home this time.</p>
<p>Upon entering Shanghai University, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow. Shanghai's top university had been occupied by the Japanese army for so many years, and it had been devastated. The once neat and tidy campus with lush flowers and trees had become a wasteland. On the large lawn in front of the former girls' dormitory, rows of Japanese men, women, and children were sorting out their luggage, preparing to have their belongings inspected by customs, military, and police personnel.</p>
<p>The general order was very good. Although the Japanese people here did not have the arrogant attitude of the past, they were not crying. After all, they had lost the war, and most of their families were broken. However, returning home is still returning home. Most Japanese people were in different moods, and returning to their hometown was still a last resort.</p>
<p>A total of 2,185 Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University yesterday. Among them were babies held in their arms, old women who could hardly walk, and strong, able-bodied Japanese merchants who had once been all-powerful in Shanghai. Major General Xie Xiaoling, Commander of the Shanghai Port Transportation Command, personally came to direct the operation, along with other senior officers from the Third Front Army. The police bureau and customs also sent people to assist, so the order was well maintained, and the inspection procedures were very swift. Although the inspectors were very strict in performing their duties, their attitude was very kind. This couldn't help but make me wonder what the situation would be like if Chinese expatriates were returning home and the Japanese military police were carrying out the inspection?</p>
<p>The Japanese nationals being repatriated this time were selected according to the selection method set by the Japanese Nationals Management Office of the Third Front Army. The same qualifications were: (1) Single men and women who cannot support themselves, (2) Undesirable elements, (3) Those who have a legitimate reason to apply for early repatriation and have been approved. Japanese military personnel and those politically connected are generally not allowed to return to their country. This is to prevent guilty parties from escaping before war criminals have been investigated.</p>
<p>Each returning Japanese national is allowed to carry 30 kilograms of luggage and 1,000 Japanese yen or national currency. Other items such as cameras, gold and silver ornaments, books and stationery are prohibited. Each person is also allowed to bring three sets of new clothes and three pairs of new shoes. If there is extra space in the luggage, they can bring other clothes and food. Yesterday, the Japanese nationals gathered at Shanghai University brought pots and vegetables to cook on the lawn, while others brought bread and canned food and sat on the grass, munching away. On the surface, these Japanese people looked no different from those who used to picnic in Zhao Feng Park and Hongkou Park. However, the wind by the river was so biting, and there was no laughter or singing here. This was not a picnic; it was a final silent meal on a wasteland before people who couldn't go home left China.</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese people were dressed very well. Colonel Wu Zongcheng of the Third Front Army accompanied me to the end of the lawn and talked to a Japanese man in a suit for a few words. I asked him, "Do you want to go back?" He replied in English, "What's the alternative? There is nothing to do and no money to spend. How can I survive in Shanghai?" I asked him again, "Where is your home?" He said, "My home is in Hiroshima." His eyes were red, and he couldn't go on. I was embarrassed to ask any further. After a while, he said automatically, "My mother and family are all in Hiroshima. I don't know how they are. I heard that an atomic bomb completely destroyed Hiroshima? ... I don't know how my mother and family are." When I went over, I was full of questions about the war and the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." After asking a few questions, when he talked about Hiroshima and the atomic bomb, I saw that he probably wouldn't be interested in the war anymore. "Why should I ask this 'bereaved dog' questions that he can't answer at this time?"</p>
<p>However, the Japanese people in Shanghai have been "darlings of fortune" for so many years and have never suffered much. The people on the lawn at Shanghai University were not emaciated or poorly dressed. Today, they will take the "Ming Yu Maru" back to a Hiroshima that has been bombed flat, and to a Tokyo that has been destroyed. They must also see what war is, and they must experience the bitter fruit of warmongering. As twilight enveloped the campus of Shanghai University, as my car drove out of the school gate, I couldn't help but wonder what these people who had once been "masters" of Shanghai were really thinking this time as they went back like this.

<h3>Mayor Qian Presides Over Expanded Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government held an expanded memorial week yesterday at 9:00 AM. Mayor Qian introduced Deputy Mayor He Dekui to all members of the Municipal Government. Subsequently, Deputy Mayor He gave a brief speech, saying, "I am honored to assume my post, but I am ashamed of my lack of talent and deeply inadequate. From now on, I will work closely with all colleagues in the government, as intimate as family members, and under the leadership of the Mayor, strive to promote all municipal facilities." Mayor Qian then reviewed the Municipal Government's organization and encouraged all staff to remain as vigilant as during wartime while the rehabilitation work is not yet completed, focus their efforts, work diligently, be loyal to their duties in their respective positions, and immerse themselves in hard work.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Office of China Aquatic Products Company Established</h3>
<p>In order to develop the aquatic products industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is establishing the China Aquatic Products Company in Shanghai. The company will manage all enemy and puppet aquatic product organizations received in Shanghai, except for fish markets, etc. A preparatory committee was first established, with Qian Xinzhi as Chairman, Du Yuesheng as Vice Chairman, and Tang Chengzong, Feng Limin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhihua, Zhang Daohong, Chen Tingxu, Dong Keren, and Qu Junyuan as members. A preparatory office was also established, with Feng Limin as Director and Qu Junyuan as Deputy Director, to carry out the actual preparatory work and commence business operations.

It is reported that all fishing vessels owned by the company will be able to go out to sea to fish within one or two days, and other businesses such as refrigeration will also begin operations soon.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Factories to Resume Production</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen previously telegraphed representatives of the Shanghai cigarette manufacturers, including Dai Genghua, to Chongqing. Recently, Dai and others telegraphed Shanghai, stating that President Song has personally agreed to provide relief to the factories and has finalized various relief measures. Therefore, the three major well-known tobacco factories in this city are preparing to resume production. The delegation is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>British Giant Airliner on Round-the-World Flight Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[British News Agency] The VM701 Lancastrian airliner, converted from a Lancaster bomber, is currently on a round-the-world flight and has now arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The aircraft took off from the UK, passing through Malta, Cairo, Karachi, Delhi, Colombo, Yangon, Kunming, and Chongqing before reaching Shanghai.</p>
<p>The aircraft will soon depart for Japan, and then cross the Pacific Ocean from Japan, hoping to complete the 2,200-mile flight from Hawaii to the US West Coast in ten hours. Although the aircraft's range has not been publicly announced, it is believed to be at least 3,600 miles, with surplus fuel available. When flying from Cairo to Karachi, it encountered headwinds of 40 miles per hour, but only took ten hours.</p>
<p>The Lancastrian airliner is equipped with four of the latest Merlin 24 engines, the same engines as the P-51 fighter. The Lancaster bomber was able to carry the world's largest bomb during the war, weighing ten tons, its capacity can be imagined.</p>
<p>Details regarding the conversion of the Lancaster to civilian use began in 1943. The aircraft's design is completely new, but the parts are the same as the original bomber. Only the fuselage has been changed to a streamlined shape, and the armament has been removed. The aircraft has a net weight of 70,000 pounds and a speed of 240 miles per hour. The top speed of this flight has not been announced. Its carrying capacity is 34,000 pounds, with a crew of five pilots, a manager, and a technician.</p>
<p>If used for transport, the aircraft can carry 48 passengers. Currently, the aircraft can carry nine passengers during the day and sleep six at night. The aircraft has a kitchen and all the amenities for passengers.</p>
<p>Before February, the first Lancastrian airliner test-flew to Latin America. Currently, British Overseas Airways Corporation is planning to mass-produce this type of aircraft for civil aviation. The original Lancaster was most suitable for combat, having sunk the German battleship Tirpitz and destroyed the Eder Dam. Before March, an unarmed version of the aircraft took off from Canada, making a non-stop flight across the North Pole to Shropshire, a distance of 4,000 miles. This flight also had a significant impact on the promotion of airliners.</p>
<p>Among the passengers on board is Air Commodore Flintham, a senior official of the British Air Transport Command. He commanded the British Transport Auxiliary, responsible for transporting the 6th British Airborne Division to Normandy, and later participated in the Battle of Anzio and the Rhine crossing.</p>
<p>Also on board are Commander Brayworth, Commander Inter, Miss Liddell of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and Colonel Li Guopei, the Chinese liaison officer of the British Air Transport Command.</p>
<p>The captain of the aircraft is Captain Payne, the pilot is Mr. Newitt, and the co-pilot is Lieutenant Heath.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Years of Travel: Dong Shuhua Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dong Shuhua, a young man from Guangdong, has been traveling for fourteen years. During the War of Resistance, he reported the country's self-defense war and reconstruction needs to overseas Chinese, passing through Vietnam, Siam, and Malaya. In 1939, he recruited overseas youth in Singapore and formed the "China Walking Corps Nanyang Team Wartime Work Group" to return to the country, serving in the war zone and the rear. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, in order to realize the "China Opera Troupe" traveling the world plan, he decided to complete the unfinished domestic journey of the troupe alone in the shortest time. He has flown from Chongqing to Beijing and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, planning a route to Tianjin and the Northeast, Korea, and then south through Taiwan, Hong Kong, Saigon, and Yangon to reach India. He will also film the general trends along the way, to prepare for returning overseas and reporting to overseas compatriots who miss the motherland.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Questioning Housing Rental Management Rules</h3>
<p>— Shang Zi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Housing Rental Management Rules and Housing Rent Standards were announced on November 25th. In the future, housing rental disputes in this city can be reasonably resolved. However, it is unknown whether the rules include the countless existing rental disputes between second landlords and third tenants in this city. There are two points that the public wants to question:</p>
<p>First, does the rule include the relationship between second landlords and third tenants? Second, the discussion on the application of the above relationship to the rules is as follows:</p>
<p>First, Article 2: Those who do not register with the committee have no right to enjoy the rules. Does this affect the rights and obligations of the lease relationship under the Civil Code?</p>
<p>First, Article 11: The lessor shall not terminate the lease unless one of the following circumstances exists. Item 5: If the lessee sub-leases the house solely for improvement and the rent charged exceeds 30% of the original rent. What kind of degree does the so-called "improvement" refer to? Subdivision of housing and construction of attics are already commonplace, and there are even more improvements for sub-leased commercial housing. Item 6: Recovery for self-use, as certified by the committee. If there is indeed such a fact, does the second landlord have the right to recover the building for self-use (there is no such provision in the Civil Code, the second landlord's recovery is nothing more than to increase use, is there a suspicion of infringing on the lives of others, which is worth studying), and the status of the third tenant and the second landlord are both lessees, at a time when there are few houses and many people, and the small-scale has not been completely eliminated, it is doubtful whether it is suitable for the actual situation.</p>
<p>First, Article 11, Item 5 stipulates that it shall not exceed 30% of the original rent. Is this the legal profit of the second landlord, or is there no restriction?</p>
<p>(Note) The above points are indeed closely related to the majority of people. Please send a letter from the Housing Rental Management Committee to explain.</p>
<h3>Campaign to Eradicate Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>First Report</p>

<p>Looking for Hong Hua Qing Hongjun, a native of Henan, worked at Guanshengyuan Food Company in Shanghai before the war. His family lived at 15 Xumennei, Suzhou. Due to environmental reasons, there has been no communication for eight years. He came to Shanghai from the mainland a month ago and repeatedly sent registered letters to his place of service and his residence in Suzhou, but there was no news. I deeply hope that he himself or his relatives who know his whereabouts will send a letter to Wang's residence, 17 Shan Le Village, Jisi Feier Road, Shanghai, addressed to Mao Guohua. My mother will be grateful.</p>
<p>Hiring a Teacher for a Free School A certain free elementary school in the Hunan District of Shanghai plans to hire a senior teacher (female only) to provide board and lodging and a small salary. Those who are willing to do so are requested to bring their credentials to Mr. Dong Jiancheng, 109 Hankou Road, at 3:00 PM for consultation.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor: How to Exchange Damaged Currency</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Our factory specializes in wholesale and frequent transactions. Customers sometimes pay for goods with damaged and torn Legal Tender Currency, or Guan Jin 法幣, stained with oil. It is difficult to refuse. After accepting them reluctantly, after a long period of time, the amount is not small. Payment to banks and dealers is generally refused. It is obviously difficult to get this kind of currency flowing. Storing it only causes losses. The pain is not unique to our factory. I don't know if it is possible to request the exchange of new notes to facilitate circulation. For this reason, I hereby send this letter requesting detailed instructions and disclosure in the newspaper so that the public can be informed. We would be deeply grateful. Hanyang Industrial Factory.</p>

<p>A Brief Chat</p>
<h3>Narrow Escape in a Car</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Many friends ask if it is really dangerous and difficult to go to the mainland. This is a long story, and at the same time, it cannot be generalized. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can pass safely. If you are unlucky, it is hard to say.</p>
<p>I took my wife and children from Shanghai to Chongqing and it took a total of thirty-three days. I didn't encounter any accidents, which is very fortunate and went very smoothly. But looking back, there was danger.</p>
<p>On the train from Shanghai to Nanjing, a young man in a suit started chatting with me. He asked me where I was going. I deliberately lied and said I was going to Tianjin. Unexpectedly, he suddenly asked, "How much is a train ticket from Shanghai to Tianjin?" This question stumped me. I was going from Shanghai to Bengbu, how could I know the fare to Tianjin? Therefore, I had to change my tone and said that I would go to Bengbu first to find a relative, and then transfer to Tianjin. Therefore, I don't know how much the fare is from Shanghai to Tianjin. I suspected that this young man was a spy sent by the enemy and puppet forces, who specialized in investigating the identity and whereabouts of passengers on the train, so I quickly tried to avoid him and stopped talking to him.</p>
<p>I know that a woman in her fifties was detained by the Japanese military police for three or four hours because she had a piece of paper on her that wrote the route from Shanghai to Chongqing. Fortunately, we didn't encounter this kind of thing.</p>

<h3>Miracle Drug for Tuberculosis: Salozide</h3>
<p>— Kuang Xuebo</p>
<p>Since the news of the American invention of the special drug "Salozide" for tuberculosis was published in the newspaper, tuberculosis patients in general have felt extremely excited, just like a group of convicts who have been sentenced to death suddenly receiving the news of a general amnesty; some patients have even temporarily shelved their planned treatments. Many neurotic patients have even suddenly stopped their reasonable treatments that were in progress, and stretched their necks to wait for the miracle drug "Salozide" to descend.</p>
<p>However, here is a piece of disappointing news for many patients: I have a classmate who just returned from the United States. He was selected by the government last year to study medicine abroad, so he is quite familiar with the medical and pharmaceutical situation in the United States. According to him, the ability of "Salozide" to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria in test tubes is indeed amazing. The results of animal experiments are also very satisfactory. However, when it was tested on the human body, because the drug was too toxic to the human body, it had adverse effects. Medical scientists are now trying their best to reduce the toxicity. The hope of success is probably very high, but the time of success cannot be determined for the time being. In any case, it will not be realized in the short term. In fact, not to mention that "Salozide" has not yet been successful, even after it is successful, other reasonable treatments must not be discarded immediately. Because once an organ is damaged, no matter what kind of miracle drug can repair it. To put it bluntly, everyone knows that Neo-Salvarsan is a miracle drug for syphilis, but if a person with syphilis has an open window, Neo-Salvarsan will never be able to restore the missing nose. Furthermore, taking tuberculosis as an example, if there is already a cavity in the lung, even if "Salozide" can immediately eliminate tuberculosis bacteria, it will still not help this cavity. In order for the lung to shrink, it must still rely on the compression therapy that is currently popular, such as artificial pneumothorax. Therefore, if you are dazzled by the excessive light from a considerable distance away, and then stop reasonable treatment casually, this may worsen the disease and leave endless regrets in the future, which is really a big mistake. Although this passage temporarily disappoints many poor tuberculosis patients, I believe it will help their diseases to some extent.</p>
<h3>Talking About Books (2)</h3>
<p>— Wei Feng</p>
<p>Ernie Pyle's Books</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, a British officer was invited to visit the American battlefield; at this time, the bodies of the dead had not yet been completely taken away. He saw the dead still tightly clutching the rifle in their hands, and couldn't help but sigh, "Warriors! Warriors!"</p>
<p>"Warriors" became the title of Ernie Pyle's second book about war reports; the first book was called "This Is Your War." These two are the most famous reportage literature published in the United States during this war, and almost every family has a copy, and everyone has read an article. Now, for the sake of portability, these two books have been abridged a little and combined into one, named "G.I. Joe."</p>
<p>Ernie Pyle was a war correspondent who specialized in reporting the lives of soldiers, with a thin figure and a bald head. He lived with the soldiers and faithfully recorded their words; due to his keen observation and natural and fluent writing, he quickly became a household name in the United States. In April of this year, he was killed by a Japanese sneak attack while observing the battle on Ie Shima near Okinawa. At that time, American newspapers mentioned him alongside President Roosevelt, calling them "two great figures who died in one month." His books are still worth reading even after the war.</p>

<h3>Reconstruction is Not Easy Meng Gu</h3>
<p>— Meng Gu</p>
<p>China's educational reconstruction is a complex and difficult task. Recently, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua talked about the seriousness of China's educational problems, citing an example. He said that there are a total of 660,000 primary school teachers in the country, of whom only more than 6,000 are formally graduated from normal schools. Only a quarter of them are qualified by teacher certification. That is to say, three-quarters of the primary school teachers in China are undesirable.</p>
<p>He also mentioned the problem of the relocation and reconstruction of universities in the mainland. He said that the original school buildings of Wuhan University are no longer enough. Supplementing and renovating them would require 140 million yuan of national currency, and building school buildings for Zhejiang University would require 130 million yuan. Renovating the Central Research Institute opposite Zhaofeng Park in Shanghai would also require 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>We feel that if the officials in power can publicly disclose their actual difficulties to the public, they will surely receive greater understanding and support from all parties, and will be able to promote government affairs and achieve many benefits.</p>

<h3>The Enemy (12)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>The cook and gardener had both worked for Sadao's father since he was a little boy, and Yumi cried for the children. She was very distressed, and after leaving, she ran back to Hana. "If the children really need me tonight, you can come and call me. I am going back to my own home, you know where it is."</p>
<p>Hana smiled and said, "Thank you," but she said in her heart that no matter how much the children cried, she would not call her.</p>
<p>She made breakfast, and Sadao helped take care of the children. The two of them never mentioned the matter of the servants leaving, except to say that they had left. But after Hana took the breakfast to the prisoner, she walked to Sadao.</p>
<p>She asked, "Why can't we see clearly what we should do? Even the servants can see more clearly than us. Why are we different from other Japanese?"</p>
<p>Sadao did not answer. But after a while, he went into the room where the prisoner was, and said rudely, "You can get up and walk around today. I want you to get up for only five minutes at a time. Tomorrow you can get up for ten minutes. You must try to recover your strength as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>He saw the horror flashing in the young face that was still very pale. The boy said softly, "Yes." He obviously wanted to say more. "Doctor, I feel I should thank you for saving my life."</p>
<p>Sadao said coldly, "Don't thank me too soon." He saw the horror flashing in the boy's eyes again—as obvious as the horror of a beast. The scars on his neck turned blood red for a moment. These scars! What were they? Sadao did not ask.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a second thing happened. Hana was doing the unfamiliar work, and she was working very hard. When she saw a uniformed messenger coming, her hands went weak and she had difficulty breathing. The servants must have already reported it. She ran to Sadao, gasping and unable to say a word. But at this time, the messenger only followed her through the garden and stood there. Helplessly, she pointed at him, saying nothing.</p>
<p>Sadao was reading a book and looked up. He was in his office, and part of the office faced the garden, which could get the southern sunlight.</p>

<p>Medical scientists studying blood have found that in a group of people with mental disabilities and intellectual weakness, one-sixth to one-quarter of them are due to the mother lacking Rh factor, while her fetus has this factor, resulting in an incompatible reaction between the two bloods.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists treating criminals suffering from depression have recently used a combination of hypnosis and psychoanalysis and have achieved great results. Ordinary psychoanalysis alone is not easy to achieve success, because it is not easy to get the cooperation of criminals suffering from this type of disease. The 1943 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. Dam and Dr. Doisy for their discovery of Vitamin K and their invention of chemically synthesizing Vitamin K. The 1944 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. Alan Gills and Dr. Gasser in memory of their significant contributions to the study of nerves.</p>

<h3>Speculation in Exchange Rates Leads to Simultaneous Fall in Gold Notes and Securities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to reports of the US dollar being unfrozen, the efforts to manipulate the market became even more energetic. At the same time, rumors spread that the official exchange rate for the US dollar would be set below 1,000 yuan and that the official gold price in the wartime capital [Chongqing] would soon be abolished. As a result, the market was exhausted and unable to rally, with the bullish side completely defeated. The outlook was even more timid. From the initial 780,000+ in the morning, the market trended downward. The midday price closed at 854,000. In the afternoon, the situation deteriorated, and the price continued to fall in line with the US dollar. In the end, it retreated to below 730,000, resulting in a drastic drop of 47,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold ornaments at silver shops continued to be quoted low at 78,000, while silver taels were at 650, leading to silver dollars remaining unchanged at around 460. The unofficial discount rate edged down from 1.5 to 1 jiao.</p>
<p>US Dollar: Initially, due to reports of the US dollar freeze being lifted, the market opened weak, with widespread selling. It immediately broke the 1,300 mark and continued to fall. Around noon, it hovered around 1,260 yuan. However, unfavorable rumors continued to circulate, claiming the official exchange rate for the US dollar would be set at 1,050 yuan, and eventually there were claims of a rate below 1,000 yuan. Buyers disappeared, and the final buying price retreated to below 1,200 yuan, resulting in a drastic drop of over 90 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar also weakened accordingly, resulting in a drop of 15 yuan. New issues fell 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, due to a lack of support and an oversupply, the market was relatively stable, but ultimately fell again by around 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Many institutional investors sold off, and retail investors also stood by and watched. Trading was light, so popular stocks underperformed less popular ones. As a result, cotton yarn shares fell 25 yuan, American Asiatic Company shares fell 50 yuan, and various small stocks fell 2 to 4.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: Initially, the market was relatively stable. However, due to the decline in the gold and dollar markets, it eventually succumbed and fell by 0.5 to 10%.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight rebound in domestically produced rice, while imported rice orders were in storage. Therefore, confidence was low, and prices fell. High-quality rice plummeted 600-700 yuan, while medium and lower-quality rice fell by a staggering 1,000 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand, and prices fell by 200-300 yuan. There were still occasional inquiries. Oil prices remained stable due to the supply from Qingdao. Store sales were sluggish, and prices continued to fall by over 1,000 yuan. Transactions were very rare. High-quality soybeans were unsalable, with a slight rebound of 600-700 yuan. Medium and lower-quality oil mills were active but not thriving, with prices falling by 100-200 yuan. The liquor market was sluggish and lacked vitality, entering a state of decline.</p>
<p>Yarn Market: Both buyers and sellers were waiting and seeing, resulting in few transactions. Prices were similar to the previous weekend, and sentiment was calm. Currently, the price of 20-count ordinary yarn is hovering between 510,000 and 580,000. Selling pressure from factories emerges at higher prices. Conversely, a demand of customer emerged when prices fall to around 510,000, this has been the general trend in the yarn market in recent months.</p>
<p>Coal Market: The market was exhausted and unable to rally. It is widely rumored that the industry association's previous application to the fuel management authority for the allocation of low-priced household white coal was rejected. However, the industry association has reapplied and is expected to be approved. As a result, buyers are hesitant, and confidence is weakening. Holders, due to financial constraints, can only sell at discounted prices. Therefore, the prices of all grades of white coal have fallen again. There were slight inquiries about superior anthracite coal dust, but the market trend was also weak.</p>
