<h3>美國藍鷹運動之破綻英</h3>
<p>目下美國工潮頗有蔓延各地起伏無已之勢若本雪凡尼亞與伊里諾等州之煤鑛工人若地答羅之汽車製造廠工人若印第安玻利之絲業工人俱因有提高工資减少工時之要求而與次資方發生不斷的激烈衝突本月六日明納波立斯市政廳前六千失業工人集隊遊行大呼「吾人要麫包與工作」之口號竟與警察發生混戰數小時之衝突足見工潮醞釀較上月下旬謠傳鋼鐡汽車紡織各業運動大規模罷工時之情形已有更露骨之發展矣工人之騷亂如是實使羅斯福躬親提倡之藍鷹運動减色不少或曰羅斯福政府之大政方針或將因之而呈激烈之轉變亦未可知推其所影響於美國及世界經濟之前途豈淺鮮哉</p>
<p>吾人猶憶當羅氏於去年三月登台之日美國金融組織曾發生空前恐慌因而造成羅氏運用獨裁手腕之機會首則排斥銀行制度之分立主義繼則糾正工商組織之放任習慣其所以能爲人民謳歌之中心人物者固時爲之也方羅氏進行華盛頓談話會參加倫敦之世界經濟會議目光四射無非欲以通力合作之方法逹到穏渡世界經濟危機之目的其所以能隠然爲資本主義世界之王者又時爲之也羅氏於發揮獨裁主義以適應國内的與國際的危機而外同時仍覺社會之一般購買力有提高之需要故又倡爲提高工資减少工時之說意若曰資本之利潤繫於生産之發達生産之發達恃乎市塲之擴張而欲市塲擴張則非提高社會收入之總額不爲功此所以必由資方厚給勞働大衆以較高之工資也凡此卽足以說明羅斯福之根本計劃不過欲藉抬高工資之手段以達到厚積利潤之目的耳然以若所爲求若所欲勢必至工人以未獲實惠而怨憤資方以有所損失而起反抗蓋因當前之犠牲雖小究爲實利未來之利益雖巨則尙遙無期也觀乎羅斯福政府一年來之治績政令如毛而成效不着擧棋不定徒召紛更至於今日非特仍無以饜一般資本家之期望卽勞工之企求亦無法使之滿足此工潮澎湃之　由來也</p>
<p>雖然目前蔓延於全國之工潮果足以使羅斯福放棄其年來所懐抱之政策乎則猶爲絕大之疑問依吾人觀察羅氏非惟不願放棄其現有之立塲且或將愈感獨裁之需要蓋工潮澎湃一則將使今日軍事化之工業生産組織發生障礙二則將使資本利潤更形枯窘羅氏爲欲執行其政策起見自惟有更使美國金融資本出於集中化獨佔化之一途然後始可以言維持美國工業之安全與利潤之確保由是觀之則今日工潮之爆發詎足以阻止羅斯福氏努力發展其政策之决心乎</p>

<h3>德國增加軍費　英挾國聯干涉　法亦表示一致行動　德稱並不違背約　軍縮主幹部重開會</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英政府正式向柏林詢問德國增加國防經費之意義一擧、係根據國聯對德現仍握有監督之權、故英政府可請國聯注意任何違背和約之行動、英法等國久疑德國於軍備一事已違背和約、某某方面今稱、觀於德國之新預算、昔日秘密行之者、今乃公然行之而無忌憚矣、（九日透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國國防經費之增加、各國咸爲駭異、今日威廉街某員延見路透訪員、曾作闢疑之詞、謂陸軍經費增至一萬七千五百萬馬克、實因陸軍須依短期軍役制完全改編之故、海軍經費五千萬馬克、擬用以逐漸刷新舊軍器與舊軍艦、空軍經費一萬三千二百萬馬克、擬用以實施保護民衆之計畫、及整頓民用航空事務、例如以多發動機飛機代單發動機之飛機、及擴張航空事務之類、所增之經費並不違背凡爾賽和約、蓋該約關於軍事預算案並無約束之條欵也云、</p>
<p>英外相西門今日告下院、謂已命駐柏林英大使向德政府探詢此事、巴黎外交界現亦重視此事、聞法政府亟欲釋此疑團、但覺由英政府與德交涉似更有效、</p>
<p>同時、外傳所謂英國關於軍縮公約已有新計劃之種推測、倫敦人士皆不之信、據稱、英國並無新計劃、惟英政府迄未表示不願考量履行公約之新保障、此項保障爲法國所願有、卽對於違約者之制裁是、此種裁制大約爲財政與經濟性質、</p>
<p>軍縮會議主席漢德森已抵日内瓦、今日發表文告、謂渠所與商之各國政府似皆一致主張應有相當之保障、第對於此種保障之厲行、意見顯相歧異云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間某要津今日聲稱、前駐法英大使竇萊爾動爵星期六日謁見法外長巴爾都、告以英政府擬請德政府說明所增之軍費是否已違背凡爾賽和約、抑凖備違背該約、巴爾都深謝竇氏之見告、並懇其轉達英政府、法内閣對於英政府之行動、完全贊同、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>軍縮主幹部　昨日重開會議　漢德森聲請促成公約　英國計劃應即予討論</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會主幹部今日午後開會時、主席漢德森發言、主張稍寛時日、俾各方面之努力、對於某種要點、或有成立恊定之結果、渠意主幹部除寛限時日外、别無善策、又謂、一九三二年、雖在遠東戰　彌漫之際、然軍縮會議開幕、頗有極大希望、惜此種有希望之形勢、寂然過去、而信任遂變爲軍備之新競爭、但有可差强人意者、卽各大國之軍備預算、現雖開始增加、但軍備競爭之進行、尙未十分着力、吾人不能不承認過去數月内之變化、已使吾人工作之進行、愈臻困難、渠希望與會諸人、不放棄其偉大事業、因吾人莊嚴責任在使軍縮會議依照條約義務、獲有一種結局、而避免軍備之新競爭云、英代表艾登繼起發言、說明英國政府謀取恊定之努力、陳述其在巴黎柏林與羅馬談話之經過情形、末謂、除他種困難外、法德雙方之見解、有基本的差異、又謂在交換意見時、渠未有阻其進行之意、故渠主張於四月三十日、召集主幹部會議、以討論交換意見之結果、而决定此後應採之步驟云、俄代表史台因發言、主張從早召集軍縮大會、並陳說各國締結不侵犯公約採納蘇俄提議及决定侵略國界說之需要、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日據軍縮會議主席漢德森稱、各國對於軍縮之意見、已不如過去之龐雜、而漸有一致之趨向、漢氏之意見可於漢氏所著一九三三年後軍縮交涉之回顧一文中覘之、該文計長三十二頁、並將於會晚發行、明日下午四時軍縮主幹委員會卽將開會、據稱、明日擧行之軍縮主幹</p>
<p>委員會、將决定依期召集五月二十三日擧行之軍縮大會、漢氏之言曰、各國對於安全意見之隔閡已漸有消釋之望、時至今日、各關係國咸認安全必須有充之保障、余意各國如能彼此恊商、則對於安全與保障必能得一明確之規定、而此種</p>
<p>規定之重要性、則與破壞軍縮公約之情形作比例云、美國國務卿赫爾自華盛頓來電稱、美國在未來之主幹委員會及軍縮會議、討論純關歐洲軍縮與政治時、仍採取不參加之態度云、美國軍縮代表台維斯今尙在假期中、美國駐瑞士公使威爾遜則已接華盛頓訓令、而爲軍縮會議之美國旁聽代表、但威氏並不參加任何軍縮討論、據稱、各國對於處罰破壞軍縮公約之担保與裁决、今後不欲有所建議云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>英内閣　討論法國照會　準備繼續進行談判</h3>
<p>（倫敦）掌璽大臣艾登奉派赴日内瓦參加軍縮會議主席團委員會、渠啓程之後、内閣軍縮問題委員會卽擧行會議、討論法國四月六日之口頭照會、據此文件、則倫敦與巴黎間之談話可繼續進行、此層果如吾人初步所料、惟英同閣必俟法國所認爲必要之軍縮公約實施保障已確切規定之後、始能考慮軍縮問題之新階段、第負責方面爲避免誤會起見、特一再聲明、英國政府始終忠守該國所提之軍縮計畫、又謂目前所考慮之德國重整軍備問題、不過爲一般裁軍之第一步辦法、關於此點、英國始終認英國軍縮計畫較優於意大利計畫、因此英國人士仍凖備進行談判、以求充實軍縮公約實施上之保障辦法、但英國計畫原定之數量、必在成立軍縮公約確能實際裁軍之範圍内、始能加以修改、故一般人對每日郵報所傳、英國將提出新計畫之說、正式加以否認、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）内閣軍縮委員會今日討論法國之軍縮照會、頗屬重要、照會内容雖尙未宣佈、惟外界已窺見其梗概、而使英政府不得不從長計議、英國是否願以保障法國之安全、以爲法國軍縮之交換條件一層、尤有關係、若干英國報紙以爲英國之軍縮折衷辦法將以法國建議爲輪廊、英國方面則限以經濟制裁爲軍縮公約中之義務、新聞記事報載稱、美國如有意維持歐洲和平、則美國之接受經濟制裁一條、當不致有異議也、每日報則新聞則謂、德國對於此事應有所表示云、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>捷克京城法國外交部長巴爾都不日將赴捷克城、訪問政界要人、捷克外人貝奈斯頃與法國駐捷克大使諾哀爾會商巴爾都來游之詳細旅程、貝奈斯當語法國大使、謂法國外長此行、實爲重要政治事件之一、將在各民族歷史中、佔一决定之地位云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙波蘭與捷克兩國間之爭端、一般人認爲業已終結、現乃仍爲波蘭與論所關心、按此項爭端發生於去年十二月間、當時波蘭前參戰軍人在西列集省西愛士克城擧行示威、該城在波蘭捷克兩國交界之地、兩國對於該城爭執甚久、嗣經海牙國際常設法院判决、乃於一九二五年簽訂議定書、將該城分屬兩國、當去年二二月間、該地波蘭參戰軍人擧行示威運動時、捷克波蘭京城方面、均哄動一時、當有波蘭人三名在捷克境内被捕、於是波蘭蘭當局亦將住居波蘭之捷克僑民二十二人驅逐出境、嗣後捷克法庭判决、開釋被捕之三波蘭人、因此一般人以爲兩國間之爭端業已終止、但具有保守黨傾向之波蘭政府機關報鐘點報本日發表一長文、論波蘭與捷克之關係、中謂捷克内部缺乏種族之統一、至於波蘭、則其所屬領土、現已恢復者、尙不過三分之二云、該報又謂、波蘭最近與蘇俄及德國訂結不侵犯條約、殊足以袪除修改波蘭疆界之危險、波蘭前與捷克同其外患、今則波蘭已不復有所畏懽矣云云、總之、該報對於波捷兩國友誼殊多疑念、結論則謂波捷兩國之疆界問题、就正義與時間而論、均屬有利於波蘭云、（十日哈瓦斯電）　　南斯拉夫京城羅馬尼亞國外長蒂杜樓斯哥前往日内瓦、本日午後二時道出此間、與外長葉夫的區擧行會議、當於晚間啓程赴日内瓦、兩國外長會晤性質、至關重要、缘蒂杜樓斯哥將代表小恊商各國在日内瓦與蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫談話、並將在巴黎與法國外長巴爾都會晤故也、官方人士於二人晤談之後、再度聲明南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞意見完全一致云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>捷克京城外長貝勒斯係軍縮會議總報告員、茲已啓程前往日内瓦、參加軍縮會議主席團會議、此間政界人士謂貝氏將在日内瓦與羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥及蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫討論小恊商各國在法律上承認蘇聯問題、大約此事不日可以解决、本月底捷克政府或卽可派遣駐俄公使云、（九日哈斯電）</p>
<h3>德國内政不佳　力求對外諒解　輿論傾向對法調和　柏林盛傳法德談判</h3>
<p>（柏林）法外長巴爾都行將聘問華沙、外間傳說法外長道經柏林時將與德當局會晤、此說昨日雖經巴黎方面否認、但德人仍以爲法外長將與德國當局會晤、而法德兩國懸案或可於此次會晤得到解决、德國輿論轉變、於茲可見、以故近數日來、報界對法國之論調已較前大爲和綏、並有人謂法國對軍縮已大讓步、蓋法國已承認軍縮會議於五月二十三日召集也、至於德對重回軍縮會議一層不復固執、德國方面亦微露此意、總之、有一點吾人可以斷定者、卽德國内部情形殊不見佳、如預算之虧負、對外貿易之不振、中央銀行之危急、社會狀况之困難、皆爲不可掩飾之事實、雖當局時作勝利之宣傳、然不足昭信於人、卽德國人民亦一盡信、其對政府之效能頗爲可疑、德國當局有此内憂、則對外不能不求諒解、而與法國尤不能不求調和云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄加入國聯　尙有若干阻力　瑞士不允承認蘇俄　端賴外交方面補救</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會中人希望蘇俄於九月間</p>

<h3>法報痛論遠東戰爭</h3>
<p>— 巴黎通信</p>
<p>三月七九日巴黎而克塞肖報載該社特派員劉洽呢氏莫斯科通訊、題曰</p>
<p>「醞釀中的遠東戰爭」、痛論日俄關係、可供我們的參考、特譯述如下、</p>
<p>駐莫斯科的日本外交家某君、見着我時、輒帶着一種嘲弄的微笑、自從日本帝國同蘇維埃社會主義共和國間國交瀕危以來、他看見我到他那裏伺候消息、已經好幾次了、他雖然是謹愼到無以復加、然而此起那些守口如瓶的他的同胞來、他算是比較地不十分令人莫測髙深的、再則他的英語、人家聽得懂、我們可以隨便的談、不過我所關心的、是對方關於日俄衝突會不會發生的意見、「我們應該警備、」遠東特别軍總司令布留俠（卽加倫）將軍、近在共産黨全國大會前聲言、「日本在那裏狂熱的備戰、他用一種孤注一擲的精力、將北滿改變成了一座堡壘、從那裏他想闖進我們的領土、」另外斯達林的輔佐中最惹人注目的平常代他說話的加干諾維支在該會前也聲言、「我們應該凖備對付任何時都可發生的一個外來的侵略、」許多外國觀察家、也覺得衝突是不可免的、所討論的、只是時期的問題、</p>
<p>這可不是同我對話人的意見、他指點給我看他辦公室窗外遮着窗子的一部份的紥架工作、「你看、我們正敎他們修理我們的大使館、而且由我們自已出錢、」於是他的微笑更加帶着冷嘲、「可見得我們沒有意思、離開莫斯科衝突、是决不會有的、因爲蘇俄不能够戰爭、他們國内的境况太嚴重了······」、</p>
<p>我們且别裝扮預言家、且先察看一下日俄關係這個問題目下的形勢、</p>
<p>在莫斯科方面、日本的侵略計劃、是毫無疑義的、此間極力喚起人們注意的、是俄國革命時東京所具的領土呑併的目的、大家知道一九一八年、日本派遺軍隊在海參　登陸、俄國内部的危機、使日本得攫取東海濱省、（黑龍江南烏蘇里河與太平洋間的地帶）　哈林島的北方、（北緯五十度以南的該島一部份自一九○五年波慈卯斯條約後卽屬日本）同外貝加爾、卽貝加爾湖以東的地帶、</p>
<p>在俄人心目中、日本當時准備的、是未來的呑併、東京亦扶助哥嘉克海軍上將、又扶助想脫離莫斯科而組織一個外貝加爾國的索米阿羅夫、以反對俄共産黨、那時美國與其說眞想維護俄國的一統、毌寗說有意阻撓日本的擴張、因美國的壓迫、日本於一九二○年撤兵貝加爾、但一直到一九二二年止、保持它的軍隊於海參崴、</p>
<p>一九二三年、不幸的地震暫時弱化日本的動力、日本盡心於彌補它的創傷、在這個新時期中、它同蘇俄的關係改善、於是一九二五年東京與莫斯科簽訂一條約、依約日本實行承認蘇維埃政府、並歸還後者薩哈林島北地帶、同時蘇俄讓與日本在薩哈林島的日本艦隊給養所必需的炭礦石油礦採掘權、</p>
<p>這以後數年間、偶爾因東察卡漁業問題而起無關大體的爭端的兩國國文、雖然說不到的親睦、然而始終平正、然而因日本的佔領滿洲、因俄國在遠東的權利所受的直接的威　、這兩國的國交、遂起一種可慮的轉變、</p>
<p>從這時起、事變迭發、就中最嚴重的是有名的中東鐵路問題、大家知道這路的歷史、前世紀末、帝俄由中國得到延長西比利亞鐵路經過滿洲直達海參崴的權利、在大戰前、這是俄國挿足遠東的最有力的一個工具、同時日本經營「南滿鐵道會社」、事實上滿洲被分成兩個勢力範圍俄國在北、日本在南、俄日兩港海參崴與大連間的競爭、隨滿洲的經濟分割而同時發生、一九二四年、承繼舊俄權利、因而享有中東路權的蘇維埃政府簽字於一恊定、這恊定規定中俄平等共同經營該路、該路管理、中俄各任一半、自從日本作滿洲的主宰以來掌管該路、那共同主權（如果我們還可以說共同主權）已經由中俄的變成了日俄的、關於該路的事變、接二連三的發生、而且因日本新築許多鐵路的緣故、該路的商業價値、也一日一日地减少、所以一九三三年五月蘇維埃政府向東京提議、將蘇俄在該路的權利、賣與日本這是一個大大的退讓、</p>
<p>莫斯科方面、自已覺得力量不够、不敢冒險與日本衝突、從歷史的眼光看來這樣的一個抛棄、結果成爲俄國勢力在遠東的失　、這個提議、到　被認爲俄國無力的口供、從許多觀察俄國内政的人們看來、則糧食問題的嚴重和鄉村的不滿、迫令令蘇俄對外、不得不取一個完全受動的途徑、我們知道售賣鐵路的談判、於一和三三年九月一度停頓之後、現在快正式繼續、甚至外間傳說兩方對售價的意見、已趨一致、</p>
<p>不過中東路問題、僅僅是日俄在遠東敵對的一面、爲防備萬一的衝突和阻止它兩面國境同被攻擊起見、兩年來蘇俄政府大展露外交上的活動、它接近了法國同德國的盟邦、尤其是得到美國的承認、而顯示了對日本的勝利莫斯科方面對於與華盛頓的合作、期望很多、自從這個安定人心的前途同美國恊力希望現露以來、此間一般人的志氣、顯見髙騰莫斯科報界對東京論調、更見强硬最近一月間和當局在共黨大會所發表的講演於主張抗戰整備的需要外、同時都力說赤軍軍力、已經實現的各種進步、上月「伊斯韋斯迪亞」報說、蘇維埃軍隊、是世界中最强的軍隊、這中問不消說多少帶點誇張、加倫在共黨大會的喝采聲中演說、略謂「我們在遠東、已經有了防備、我們的邊界、已經鎖牢了、已經用水泥同鐵圍住了、那裏有我們最好的幹部將校、我們有我們第一次五年計劃所産生的坦克車同飛機、」雖然加倫氏在公衆前、沒說出任何數字、一般人估計、遠東特别軍約有十五萬人左右、此外蘇俄空軍現在是世界最强的空軍之一、據最低限度的估計、蘇俄現有各色飛機五千架、去年五一在莫斯科上空盤旋的轟炸機、可在千基羅米突以上的活動圈内動作、那就是說載着五百基羅格蘭姆乃至一噸的炸彈、這種轟機、從海參崴或從東海濱省任何地點出發、可以與日本各大中心地帶以致命傷、而蘇俄現在至少有五百架轟炸機、此外須加上千五百架驅逐機、它的兵工廠、全是新式的、極力在那裏製造中戰時蘇俄在運輸上、難免遭遇非常的困難、這是眞的、但目下他們正努力將西北利亞鐵路、改築變軌、大家覺得在交上看來、同在軍事上看來、將來時勢、也許漸於蘇俄、加以内政情况、雖仍不免使當局操心、但比去年已减少了不安、最近的收成很好、雖因運輸的遲滯而受了巨大的損失、末了、在免稅及别種利益的形勢之下、政府讓與了農民們許多東西、尤其是在西北利亞同邊境地方、蘇俄政府因爲覺到危險、所以此後對鄉村採取一種比較更合理的政策、這樣說、並不是說我們就此可友預斷萬一發生衝突的結果、假令這衝突是限於一個地方（這恐怕是事實所不許的）這兩國力量的比較、是極複雜的一個問題、我們不敢輕下斷語、不過無論最近將有一天衝突會爆發、或因種種讓步而可避免、有一　事是顯然的、就是兩個敵人中間終局、必有一個須讓另一個在遠東自由行動、如同英國爲充實印度的防禦起見、擴充了或曾經努力擴充它的勢力到隣近各國、波斯·阿富汗·尼斯坦·西藏·緬甸等等一樣、日本爲防護那接近它所奪得的豐僥的殖民地的入口計、將來必努力侵入蒙古同外貝加爾、而使日本海同阿哥茲克海、變成一個日本的裏湖、蘇俄一部份人士間、甚至以爲日本志在乘中國還在混亂時、使中國解體、或使它統一於溥儀的治下、幾日前、「伊斯韋斯迪亞」報說、日本人敎溥儀稱帝的意思、是使中國人團結於溥儀最後所代表的那個陳腐帝政之下、而一面呼號共産主義之危險、使世界公認在亞洲的日本霸權、姑無論這些假說如何、我們應該注意太平洋在各種形式下發展的這個鬥爭的演變、（譯者附註）此間輿論界、新近關於日俄戰爭的預測、前有蒲楞氏在巴黎評論中發表的一篇文字、詳述日俄衝突的遠因近例、以及該記者對於未來的憂慮、今有劉洽呢氏在而克塞肖報（三月十九日）的莫斯科通信都是可讀的文章、蒲楞氏自遠東旅行歸來後、屢次撰稿於巴黎時報、又在太平洋問題研究會講演對中日問題、持論公允、深得識者同情、蒲楞氏觀察中日兩國所得意見、與滬戰時到遠東的韋歐麗斯夫人的見解、有許多地方吻合、韋歐麗斯夫人解剖日本現狀的著作、是普通新聞記者所作不到的、但蒲楞氏不蔽於九一八以來日本於數月内花費數千萬弗郎的宣傳烟幕彈、而能將中日兩方事實、赤裸裸地向讀者叙述、尤其是對日方口口聲聲所詆毁的所揑造的中國無政府、中國不具國家組織等、能一一加以駁斥、能將中國處境之困難、詳細說明、能將中國在萬難的困境中繼續不斷的努力、同這種努力所得到的微微的然而不可漠視的好果、指點出來、使讀者諰識現在同時信賴將來、這種坦白無私的態度、這種嫉惡如仇的勇氣、都是我們所敬佩的、我們感謝蒲楞氏、因爲他的文字、掃除了不少歐洲人士對中國的誤解、我們驚歎日本人的法力無邊、因爲他們自從發現蒲楞氏的記載於他們不利後、居然有力量慫慂軍火商人、從中作梗、使許多日報謝絕蒲楞氏持論謹嚴的文稿、使蒲楞氏所想摘發的許多事實、無由暴露、去年十二月二十二日巴黎時報登有蒲楞氏的中國通信「第一」一直到現在竟不見第二·第三·的接續、這便是一個證明、劉洽尼氏這篇通信、介紹莫斯科方面對日本態度、同俄方整備軍實的情形、有我們知而不詳的、有我們未知的、末段數行所叙日本的野心、更可促我們的深省、（世界電訊社）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>研究國際問題　的又一舉例㈠</h3>
<p>讀書指導··</p>
<p>這是我第二次與你們通訊、請恕我不再寫磱叨的寒喧語了。</p>
<p>國際風雲、瞬倐萬變·眞是令人不可捉摸。像日美在遠東的利害不能相共，這是誰都知道的當前事實；並且還有不少的國際問題評論家，曾經說過，日美在太平洋上必出一戰，所成問題的，不過時間問題耳。</p>
<p>當時我讀了他們的論調，到也覺得「言之成理」。可是那裏知道，日美不但目前不會戰爭，近來且有妥恊換文之說。幾位國際問題評論家，聽到了這個消息、想來不免要揑把冷汗吧！因爲鐵的事實把他們的結論推翻了。可是聰明的國際問題評論家是决不會認輸的，他們又很巧妙地說着，英美的經濟關係，還要比日美的來得嚴重；所以，假使日本對於美國能有相當的諒解，使美國在遠東得分一羹，美日也許有妥恊的可能的話兒來哄騙我們。因此，我近來對於這些前後矛盾的言論起了懷疑，│他們可以用一枝生花妙筆來左右意見，而我們却不能長此跟着他們盲從呀。然而怎樣可以解决這個問題呢？那就非請你們指導不可了！</p>
<h3>（趙麟祥來信）</h3>
<p>我們以前也曾提出過一篇研究國際問題的文字，隨後又在「怎樣研究東北問題」中略亦過一些原則上的運用，近來大約是因爲國際情勢的緊張的緣故罷！讀者的來信中，很有不少的人能將我們以前所提出的方法，運用到實際問題上去。自然，這是一種進步的現象，是很可引爲樂觀的·</p>
<p>趙麟祥君在這次日美外交的轉變中，能注意到一般時論家的言論，並且加以前後的比較，這是極可取的。趙君對他們的言論深致不滿，我們也覺得似無足怪，因爲他們所持之論，在外表上看來都很正確，但是都有缺點。因爲他們運用的「觀察法」是太公式化了，機械化了，不能將關係間各方面的勢力的消長，變化，及給與當前形勢的影響一併加以考察，將這種極端複雜錯縱的關係，一層層的處理，一層層的加到分析的中心核心去。　如以日美在太平洋上的對立作爲研究日美關係的分析的中心，原無不可，但日美外交上所表現的，並不僅是這一對立的反映，它比這更要複雜。研究英美關係自然我們應不忘了英美在資本主義體系中是站主要的對立的兩極上，但英美關係在外文上的反映，也並不是天天板起面孔，喊打喊殺的。並且，我們還要注意到甲國與乙國的關係並不是張三同李四的關係那樣簡單，因爲甲國或乙國换的本身都是一個予盾的綜合，一國内部有階級勢力的變動，一個階級（指資産階級）内部又有各種不同羣體的勢力的變動，譬如，工業資本家同金融資本家對立，工業資本家同時又與農業資本家對立，由是，在政治上就有由以上的實力者爲後台的各種政黨的對立，（這許多利害衡突的對立的所以然，本是很簡單的，但要詳細的說明其原因，則未免太冗長矣，讀者如要研究，可來函說明，本部當另函解答·）這些勢力的變動，自然要影響到一國之對外的經濟的及政治的作戰力，卽所謂對外的國策。這國策就是由許多矛盾綜合而成的一國際勢力的單位，它進而構成國際的這一大矛盾的綜合。（未完）</p>

<p>僞組織參加遠運表演絕望</p>
<h3>我國據理駁斥日本　菲主張依據會章辦理日詞窮理絀　日提議本屆遠運展期將由菲决定　日體協會會無理責駡菲人</h3>
<p>第十屆遠東運動會、已陷入於無期延期之趨勢、中日菲三國代表昨日上午在華懋飯店、非正式會議之結果、中日隻方、各堅持已見、對於僞組織之參加、絲毫不示讓步、遂成僵局、一無結果、最後日代表提議、請求將本屆大會延期擧行、而菲代表談博士亦於昨日下午四時、乘亞細亞皇后號返菲、談博士允許於最近期内、將菲島是否同意延期電知中日雙方、日代表事前滿懷希望、以爲在菲代表恊助之下、必能勝利而歸、今結果如此、大爲表示不滿也、茲將昨日會議經過情形、彙錄如次、</p>
<h3>華懋飯店會議續開</h3>
<p>中日菲三國代表、爲討論僞組織參加遠運表演問題、昨晨九時五分、在南京路華懋飯店五二三號、繼續舉行非正式會議、出席代表、仍如前日、我國爲體恊會董事曹雲祥、體恊會主幹沈嗣良、日本代表山本、松澤、及駐滬領事乾精末、菲代表談博士、書記周家騏李女士、由談博士主席、先將前日紀錄、互相交換、改正審定、簽字完畢之後、乃開始辯論此全球矚目之僞組織參加</p>
<p>問題、一時空氣緊張、中日代表、互相堅持、直至午刻十一時三十分、仍無結果、乃宣告散會、</p>
<h3>字句推敲欲逞狡辯</h3>
<p>昨日會議之中心、在尋求一可能之解决此問題之辦法、日方代表、仍堅持一九三零年印度參加表演之前例、將上屆紀錄、及大會會章、字句推敲、以作强辯、而問題之焦點爲全體贊同與多數贊同、日方稱一九三零年印度之參加表演、並未經全體會員之同意、僅由菲律賓提議、中國贊同而已、故此次僞組織之參加、亦祇須日本提議、菲律賓贊同、多數卽可通過、因當時紀錄、並非指明全體同意也、於是中代表當將日方狡辯駁斥、謂當時印度之參加表演、雖紀錄並未註明全體通過、但亦未註明日本反對、是則換言之、卽全體通過、毫無疑義、日本表無辭可答、</p>
<h3>理窮詞絀捉襟見肘</h3>
<p>雙方辯論、甚爲劇烈、日方尤常根據極小之立塲</p>
<p>作爲狡辯之依據、然口齒笨拙、理由毫無、迭遭我方之駁斥、我代表並詢以按照尊意、僞組織之加入、果與治無關、彼何不自向太會提出、而必倩貴國代疱、日人竟辭窮理屈、其捉襟見肘之窘態、可見一斑、乃訪日人進而竟稱、苟中國承認僞組織加入、卽事實上之不加入、亦無不或云云、尤足徵其途窮匕見之醜態、</p>
<h3>三項辦法全數推翻</h3>
<p>雙方卽各趨極端、於是經全體同意、擬就若干可能解决之辦法、辦法凡三、㈠將此問題、暫時不談、提交在馬尼拉之大會討論之、卽僞組織本屆决不能參加、留待馬尼拉大會中决定其可否下屆參加、但付表决之結果、日本投反對票、遂不成立㈡將此問題提交執行委員會中討論之、表决結果、日本亦反對、蓋執委會中、必遭我國委員王正廷之反對、毫無疑問也、最後之第㈢辦法、暫且依照日本之提議、以多數作表决、立卽請菲律賓表示可否之决定、如菲島同意、則我國退出、菲島反對、則日本屈服或退出、如此一言可决、但菲代表反對、不願作同意或否之表决、謂菲律賓之行動須根據大會之會章而不能貿然也、三項辦法、旣次第推翻、會議遂陷入無結果之境矣</p>
<h3>無法收拾宣告散會</h3>
<p>菲代表至此、無法决定、見雙方堅持甚烈、乃决定不付表决無法收拾、宣告散會、談博士致詞云、中日雙方、旣各持已見、對於大會紀錄、又不完備蓋指一九三○年印度問題也、且限於大會會章之規定此問題决定不付表决、任聽中日雙方、作如何之解决、但至萬不得已時、萬一遠東運動會陷於解散、菲律賓凖備作如是之犠牲、惟必須向中日雙方告者、菲律賓在此次遠運之籌備中、建築運動塲等等、所費千萬、爲數已頗不　、最後之願望爲希望中日雙方、能予以合作、如歷屆彼此之合作也、</p>
<h3>日方提議遠運延期</h3>
<p>日代表乃起立、向菲代表提議、請求將本屆大會、延期舉行、菲代表答以此問題須待返菲商議之後、才能答覆、一俟返菲决定之後、當卽電告中日雙方、三國代表、各無異辭、中日代表向菲代表談博士致詞感謝其遠道來滬主持會議後、乃宣告散會、</p>
<h3>菲島代表昨已離滬</h3>
<p>菲代表談博士、以昨日會議形勢惡化、中日雙方意見、各走極端、無法挽救、且菲方處於主人地位、又難以表示、故於會議終了、卽於下午四時、由滬乘搭昌興公司之亞細亞皇后輪返菲、向遠運會各籌備當局報告此次經過、體恊會沈嗣良等、俱往船埠送行、在目下形勢觀察本屆五月十二日在菲舉行之遠東運動會、因日方提議僞組織參加表演問題牽動大會前途、一時難望解决、大會將無期延期、聞菲方對本屆運會籌備費、已用去五百萬元、</p>
<h3>遠運預選繼續進行</h3>
<p>據沈嗣良談、遠運前途命運、雖尙在不可知之數、但各項預選手續、决仍繼續擧行、今日爲各處報名參加預選之最後一日、本市運動名將、均已報名、預選仍依原定計劃、大會之是否舉行、聽其自然而已、</p>
<h3>遠運破裂日負其咎</h3>
<p>復據沈嗣良談、對于遠運問題、國人諸多誤會、實則我當局、無時不在積極奮鬥中、此項會議、因屬於非正式性質、且攸關國際情面、故不得不參加討論、然我抱定正議以與周旋、果至無法挽救之時、我自當退出、以求貫澈以往之言論、吾人决不敢妄作主張、以致有傷國體、至今後之一切、須俟菲方表示、總之我與日本所抱之、主張、各趨極端、如日方堅持不讓、則大會破裂、或我國之退出、其咎應由日方担負、</p>
<h3>兩田徑隊發表宣言</h3>
<p>北平中華及上海白虹兩田徑隊、昨發宣言云、全國體育界同人公鑒、今者、某國嗾使僞滿參加遠運、意欲造成我國默認僞滿之正式存立、是蓋假體育之名、而助其侵略之實也、倘吾人覥顔與僞滿比肩下塲、是國際聯盟、世界各國、及我全國民衆、所不承認僞滿之問題、乃輕輕斷送於吾體育界之手、昨日之會議、雖無結果、然菲方所擬就之三辦法固不利於我方也、尙望我體育界同人一致奮起、俾當局得有實力之後盾寗退出遠運、而不稍退讓、北平中華田徑隊上海白虹田徑隊、同叩、</p>
<h3>日本竟抱怨菲律賓</h3>
<p>據昨日埠日文報每日新聞載稱、第二日遠東大會特别會議、日華兩國之主張、依然懸隔甚遠、特召集此會議以前、斐律賓本同意日本之主張、不料至會議時、突然大變態度、竟傾向於中國方面、彼以避免目前問題之决定、極力拖延、因此排斥日本方面之多數主張、而附和中國之全會一致論、日本之提案、遂歸失敗云、</p>
<h3>會議正式紀錄</h3>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>周厚樞談　考察日本敎育之印象㈠</h3>
<p>▲日本敎學之知識技能多以向外發展對華侵略爲目的</p>
<p>▲敎育政策始終一貫注重體格鍜鍊軍事訓練勞動生産</p>
<p>余等此次奉江蘇敎育廳派赴日本考察敎育、二月底由滬出發、至今回國、共在日六星期、在東京約居三星期、轉在橫濱、各古屋·碧海郡·京都·大坂·奈良·神户·别府·長崎·等處參觀共約三星期、在此六星期中計訪詢敎育行政機關、考察大學·髙等·專門·中學·師範·小學·髙小職業學校、社敎機關、社會事業機關、工廠·農塲、農村事業機關等共八十餘處、團體考察報告初稿、不日整理就緖、卽擬呈繳敎廳、將來並擬專册刋布、在日參觀之際、常受其帝國主氣氣焰之激刺、此爲吾人所永不能忘、亦願多向國内各方面陳說、以堅吾人團結禦侮之精神者也、</p>
<p>日本敎育明以忠君愛國爲主旨、實則鼓勵全國小國民好勇　很、並令其堅信侵略式之國家主義、一切敎學之知識技能之敎授、多以向外發展、尤以對華侵呼略爲目的、此應爲吾人深切注意發奮警惕者也、一般小國民旣受如此敎育、將來長成以後、其對華心理之凶狠、行爲之辣毒、更可想而知、眞令人不寒面而慄、最可怕者、一般校長及主持人、雖日以貫輸其小國民向外侵略思想爲務、而在吾人參觀之際、則無不盡力表示其親睦態度、甚至有謂日本對華行爲、是軍閥之錯誤、而與敎育界無關、口蜜腹劍、頗有難以自圖其說之苦、日敎育界絕對服從政府、而政府悉受軍閥之支配、其曰無關、眞不知何以自解、日人在佔據東北四省、企圖囊括我華北五省、厲行經濟侵略政治侵略之際、其政府固無不日日以中日親善之髙調欺騙世界列邦及我國擧國上下、今觀望敎育界乃至一般人士之言論態度、亦無不與政府同出一轍、於此可見其擧國一致國民外交之精神、近聞吾國各方面多有繼起組織日本參觀團者、甚望於接受日人優禮、厚遇甘言蜜語之際、勿爲所惑、更勿忘其爲吾人永世不忘之大敵、其言愈甘、其意愈令人可疑、幸勿忽之、</p>
<p>日本敎育宗旨之荒謬、自我國博大之三民主義立塲觀之、不但應視爲吾人之大敵、亦應視爲世界之公敵也、其宗旨雖不足取、然實施方面則多有足資效法之處、此爲考察時所特别注意者也、茲就個人見聞所及、略擧其優點數則如次、</p>
<h3>㈠敎育政策始終一貫</h3>
<p>日本敎育、重保守、少變動、陪新後、明治二十三年頒訂敎育勅語、大致以孝悌忠信、修學進德、愛國忠君爲要、數十年來全國守之不渝、一方面以人人受敎育爲務、據其文部省（敎育部）稱、全國識字者達全國人民數百分之九九·五一、一方面全國敎育界、澈始澈終、採取同一步調、因此一切政策與方法、雖未見其新、而上下一貫、行之旣久、自見成效、吾國敎育界、向無自主精神、東西標竊、各自爲政、標新立異、反覆無常、溯自施行新敎育以來、亦敎十年、以時間言、並未後於日本而以方針政策、擧國不致、始終不一貫之故、至今一無成就、人民敎育程度、反見低落、故今後吾國敎育、不欲求進步則已、苟欲求進步、則應實行統制化、由政府確立一適合國情之簡單方針、通令全國一致遵行、違者科之法律、方針旣定、步驟旣一、則外國學術思想、僅可附麗此中心思想、而不能使其根本動搖、如此行之旣久、則成效自有可觀、</p>
<h3>㈡注重體格鍜鍊</h3>
<p>日本學校及社會方面、對於體格鍜鍊之注重、至堪驚異、學生正課體操、非如吾國之完全以球戲爲主、蓋球類運動鍾屬良好、而不易普遍、學生之不好運動者、多袖手旁觀、或逃往自修室仍事埋首、日本體育注重普遍化之運動、吾人在參觀中小學體育課時、男生在一小時内、全體所做之柔軟操·器械操·木馬·繩索·跳躍運動等、毫無間斷、女生則做有規律富美術意味之舞蹈運動、每晨必有極整齊而劇烈之早操、課後俱有劍道·柔道·弓道·摔角等項角力運動、夏季則有游泳、暇期中則有臨海團之海邊生活、山岳團之登山遠足、平時常由敎師率往數十里或百餘里外作徒步旅行、學校除注重體格鍜鍊之外、復注意於營養衛生、如東京市立一中、學生必須在校午餐、由校配備靑年必要之營養食料、此實爲一般敎育界所忽視、而應注意者也、至社會之提倡各種體育競賽、則更在在見其普遍而熱烈、無線電所播之音、晨間七時有早操運動節目、使全國人民遵做早操、其餘時間則多播散運動塲上之競賽消息、於此足見各地運動塲終日無空間時間、更可見一般國民之好尙矣、</p>
<h3>蘇敎育日考察團返國</h3>

<h3>湘敎廳　奬勵本省專門學生　每名各奬一百零五元</h3>
<p>（長沙十日電）敎廳取定省内外專門湘生一百名每名給奬百零五元、</p>
<h3>鴻英圖書館積極籌備　本年秋季試行開放　建館問題尙須考慮</h3>
<p>鴻英圖書館係實業家葉鴻英氏捐資承受人文圖書館之圖書而設立、現設籌備處於霞飛路、現正積極籌備、擬於秋季試行開放建館問題現尙未决定、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>本年秋季試行開放</h3>
<p>該館籌備處自遷設霞飛路新址後、鑒於該處環境優美房屋寛敞、擬於本年秋季試行開放、惟以該館所輯史試行其他圖書編目等、尙有大部份整理未竣、依照現有工作人員、難於應付、或恐秋季不及開放、故刻正積極工作、必期時於可能範圍内增加人員、恊助辦理、希望能如期試行開放云、</p>
<h3>建館問題尙须考慮</h3>
<p>該館原擬於法租界適當地點、購地建築新館址、惟以該館基金現祇四十元、購地建築設備費均包括在内、早前經常用費月需二千餘元、如一旦動用一部份基金、故以所餘部份之子息充平日開支、恐不敷支配則建築館舍問題、尙須經過愼密之考慮、而後可决定云、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>但是從北京到奉天的路程，委實是太遙遠了一些，連太后自已也知不能再乘鸞輿去了。而且伊恰巧已從外國鐵路公司那裏買來了一列「御用列車」，雖然伊已化了一筆驚人的巨欵，│這並不是鐵路公司的人欺騙伊，實在因爲經手的人都要錢，一層一層的加起來，到最後、它的總數竟足一個較小國家的全年的開支了。其中，李蓮英當然也有分，誰也不知道他得了多少的銀子。一但是伊却還不曾使用過一次咧。伊時常在懷疑··坐火車究竟是怎樣的一種滋味，所以這一次，决意要想試一试了。伊實在是難得離開北京城的，借這個上奉天去的機會，伊想看看伊自已所統治着的土地；也許伊還想見到幾個平民，不過這一點，在事實上是不可能的。因爲尋常的平民，照例是不准見伊的，於是伊也就不能見他們了。每逢聖駕出巡的時候，不但大道上不許有什麽閒人逗留，就是附近的小街上的行人，也定被驅逐凈盡。然而據我和我的妹妹所知道，每當皇太后或皇上在街上經過時，兩旁的居民們無有不在家裏挖開了紙窗，從一個小孔裏偸看着的；祇是因爲皇太后們所乘坐的鸞輿、以及女官們所乘坐的紅色大轎，都是遮得密不通風的緣故，他們雖在窗孔裏偸看，却並不能看見我們的一手一足。我有時往往歡喜把我的轎簾拉開一些，以便瞧瞧外面的景致，但是也不敢拉得太開，使外面的人能够看見我；因爲我要如這樣不拘禮的話，旁人就要大加指摘了。（八）</p>
<h3>春秋春天的都市</h3>
<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>春天，迷人的季節。那歷靑的街道上，新綠的街樹，淸香浮動了；電車駄着片片的樹蔭，像一個醉漢似的，踏着蹣跚的步伐，隆隆地爬去了。</p>
<p>黃浦江上吹來的風是溫柔的，把每一個人的心花吹開啦！姑娘們換上了明媚的時裝，像初生的乳燕一般，嬌羞地挽着年靑戀人的胳膊，輕快的飄進醉人的公園去　　在明朗的陽光下，在柔滑的草茵上，映畫着情侶們的影子；紅皮長椅上，濃綠的樹蔭裏，洒滿了肉的香，粉的香，旖旎的情話。棕櫚樹的闊綠的葉子邊，娘兒們的紅腮帮露出來了，彷彿菓子舖的綠盆子裏的鮮艶的花旗蘋菓；喧笑聲跟香的氣息沸騰着，春的公圍是已回到它的黃金時代了。</p>
<p>人們的臉上都掛着一絲愉快的笑影，只有那孤獨的年靑人，把掛在胳膊上的手杖當做戀人，把失去了風情的老園丁當做愛人，寂寞地徘徊在岑沈的河岸邊，幽寂的樹叢裏，瞧瞧鱗波微縐的河面，聽聽黃鶯淸脆的歌唱，像憂鬱的詩人似的。</p>
<p>當夜的黑網張開後，懷春的男女、如醉如痴地鑽進那蕩漾着春光的舞宮去了！靑春的狂熱像火一樣燃燒着，醉啦！醉在舞女的懷抱裏，爵士樂的旋律上，桃色的葡萄酒杯裏············！</p>
<p>春天的都市，姑娘們的紅　更顯得嬌艶了，公園的游人更顯得擁擠了，舞塲的曲子更顯得迷醉了，異性的追求更顯得瘋狂了！</p>
<h3>有聊的話</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>「救國就是救自已」，這句話沒有半點兒錯。朋友，你不相信麽？看哪！張三藉救國而發了一注大財，李四才喊了幾句口號就榮任了某要職······不說也吧，多說了你會眼紅！</p>
<p>三年畢業，文憑一張，換不得飯吃，當不上一文臭錢，娶小老婆之壯志已消，陞官發發財之道難找，全無職業，好一個中等游民，嗚呼！哀哉！此讀書之過歟！</p>
<p>人間就是地獄，地獄便是天堂，不然的話，那麽爲什麽生存在人間的人總說社會是個地獄，而死了的人明明是跑到地獄，却呌昇天呢！</p>
<p>才子娶佳人，博士娶鄉下女，啞子娶盲妻，大官娶小姐，學子娶明星···前後不同，方能結爲夫婦，三生石上，早緊良綠，所望海内同胞，勿以夫人之性情不同而離異也。</p>
<p>當官的見了「上司」是一副面孔，見了「屬員」又是一副面孔，奸商們見了「闊人」「小姐」們是一副面孔，見「老莊稼人」又是一副面孔，當兒子的見了父母，兄弟，姊妹，是一副面孔，見了自已的愛妻嬌兒又是一副面孔。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二七回　閨怨暗中消慈懷可感　閒愁醉後起舊事難忘</p>
<p>最後他自言自語道··這也好，免得我從今以後胡思亂想的了。我記着今天的事，我一胡思亂想就望這張相片。他這樣想着，就在箱子裏格子裏，各處都尋了一遍，把趙自强本人的相片，無論是新的舊的，半身的，全身的，都拿了出來。現在不光是把相片掛在墻上了，梳妝台邊，坐桌邊，玻璃格子裏，床頭邊，床脚邊，各處都有一張相片。假如自已坐在屋子裏想心事的話，抬起眼睛皮來，就可以看到自已的丈夫。那麽，在良心上說，自已不好意思再想情人了。他在屋子裏鬼使神差的，胡想一陣，又胡忙一陣，倒足閙了半上午。直到吃午飯的時候，趙翁在堂屋裏呌着吃飯，才安定了。因答道··老爺子，你請用罷，我先不想吃呢。趙翁道··這可不像話。年輕小伙子，常是不吃飯，還不如我們老頭子啦，每餐都是三大碗。桂枝道··老爺子，你請罷，我眼睛有些痛。趙翁道··你總得吃一點，不吃飯，精神打那裏來？這痛也就更抗不住了。他口裏如此說着，人也就站在房門口等候。桂枝一想··老爺子鬚髮蒼蒼，偌大年紀，倒要站在門外伺候靑年人吃飯，良心上也太說不過去，於是趕快的在箱子裏找了一副自强留在家裏的眼鏡，架在鼻梁上，這才笑着走了出來。趙翁倒不疑心他别的事，在吃飯時，見桌上是一碗羊肉熬白菜，一碗北豆腐煮　菜，一碗　疙疸絲，便道··羊肉是大發的，這兩樣菜又　，你别忙着吃，給你煮兩個鷄蛋罷。他爲着求快起見，起身便去拿鷄蛋。（三五九）</p>
<h3>回鄉運動</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>「復興農村，到鄉村去，」成爲切時的口號··國家基礎建築在農村的中國，更臨着農村破産之際，國勢殆危之會，一般認爲是「起死回生」的靈丹。所以在城市裏的人們，都提倡回鄉運動　　好，看他們回鄉去，帶着照相器，架起「克洛克」，拿了「司的克」，西其裝，革其履；正牌的鄉下人看見，大家說是洋先生來了。</p>
<h3>玉蝴蝶譜胡蝶主演姊妹花本事</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>千萬人生味苦，喑彈珠淚，初别蓬門。竹馬靑梅，小時踪跡還存。儘無聊，明簾盡梀，應悵望樵市漁村。奈黃昏。嬌兒索乳，舊曲重溫。休論。雲泥兩隔，愁腸念遠，笑　承恩。自兩豪華，肯從對面　啼痕。易傷神，花間驟雨，思往事，月底空尊。繞林園。春來鳳子，好醒芳魂。</p>

<h3>小吃四様</h3>
<p>— 尙眞</p>
<p>「人生在世，吃着兩事」，况且我國吃的藝術，名滿全球，豈可有口福而不享；但是熊掌駝峯不是一般人所能吃到的，這兩件東西我也聞名而未見面，且弄些小東西吃吃罷！</p>
<p>金橘餅採購上號金橘如蜜棗般，用小刀四周剖縫，縫與縫的距離大約和一粒米一般長短，過闊擠不出核，過細容易折斷，剖後一一將核擠出，使成雙疊菊花狀，但留心擠斷。隨卽和水放入瓦鍋，炭火煮一遍。在半熟時加入白糖，大約金橘一斤配糖十二兩，糖放入之後熱力大增，此後須時時翻拌，個個撳扁。煎熬到金橘由硬而軟現出透明狀態，要立刻將鍋離火；若火過了頭，非但要焦並且變成僵硬。這樣揀明的挨次拿來放在玻璃缸内，好像金花朶朶，吃起來豈但味美芳香還可開胃健脾哩！</p>
<p>玉蘭片玉蘭仲春開花，滿樹雪白，採取半開者，祗用中層的花瓣，因外層較老近心味苦，用淸水輕輕洗凈，重了化瓣變黃就不可用。另用糯粉（麯粉也行惟嫌稍硬）和水拌白糖備用。鍋子裏煎油至沸（油的　素隨便），將筷子輕箝花瓣滿蘸粉汁，投到鍋裏火頭要緩，看見邊緣似乎有些焦的神氣，立刻取出，玉蘭片就成功了。其味，香甜鬆脆，吃過之後，頗有齒頰留芳之槪。</p>
<p>玫瑰醬用將熟未黃的上好梅子放入瓦鍋注些淸水，炭火燒透後，這些酸味太重的梅子湯濾去，再用筷子剔掉皮核，放過一邊。另外預備半放的玫瑰花取瓣去心，搗爛絞去水汁，再合白糖（糖量約當梅子的兩倍重，花多則色濃）同搗和先前的梅醬併放入鍋。炭火煎煮到相當時候取出，色艶香濃味鮮，裝入瓷器，可以隨時取食。如用鹽梅洗凈和乾的玫瑰花做起來，同樣可能，可是各方面都要較遜一籌了。</p>
<p>紫蘇梅梅子太小了無味，太熟了不脆；所以要用肥脆的，輕輕拍碎不必去核。和梅子同時生的紫蘇除去老葉或梗子，拌上二倍於梅子重的白糖，不需要煎煮，放入容器内，在夏天的日光中晒上三五天，一天翻動兩三次。等到梅子肉染上了紫色，卽可咀嚼了，香氣馥郁，其味遠勝市上的翠梅，紫蘇也很可口有特殊的風味。</p>
<p>以上四樣東西是作者家庭中常玩的小吃，花錢不多，也合衛生，色香味都好，敢貢獻給閱者，請主持家政的蜜雪司或在預備中的蜜司實地嘗試。倘是儘管買舶來品的聽頭餅乾或果醬，放棄了享受「國味」的幸福，殊不値得呢！　　喲！空氣多麽淸潔，呼吸了眞暢快，那些山光水色，芬芳的花朶，油綠的草木，够多麽好玩！風景的優美，那裏是不見天日的城市所能比擬其萬一。於是東一莊，西一宅，中西合璧的房屋，馬上建築起來了。</p>
<p>啊！畢竟這鄉村枯燥無味··那些笨牛也似的蓬頭垢面的鄉下老，着實有點討厭。出門黃包車也不好行走，兩隻腿的苦頭吃盡了。所謂娛樂，不過門窗不全的茶園。「媽的，到城市去！」</p>
<p>哦！那幾家新宅召租的條子，貼得是多末大！</p>
<p>但，還這樣熱閙着··</p>
<p>「復興農村！</p>
<p>回到鄉村去！」</p>

<h3>「鬼文」觀</h3>
<p>— 無漏</p>
<p>文壇上鬼祟最多，看來看去，肉眼可以變爲天眼。文章之美醜，應該一落眼便知道的，如善打牌的人一觸手便知什麽牌，經騐造成了一種特别的感覺。而天眼的神妙也者，是隨隨便便可以感覺什麽文章大概是什麽人寫的，或什麽人應該寫什麽文章，如見肝肺。</p>
<p>那妙處，是先得略辨人鬼之分，有堂堂皇皇的偉論是鬼文，有看不入眼的其實是人文。有變鬼未全的鬼文，有已鬼氣的人文·鬼文之中，又有神通廣大的鬼文，又有神通未足的鬼文，更有老老實實小鬼的鬼文······之類。</p>
<p>打通電的時代好像有些過去了，可惜死掉了一個「僥漢祥」，便無繼響，有些紳士們不能搖頭晃腦了，便不快意！那可算鬼文之最神通者。於是有宣言時代，演說時代，「親愛的同胞······」之類的大作，也還是鬼文。此外有許許多多社會小說，更是舍沙射影，爲鬼蜮中之傑作！</p>
<p>稍研究過「邏輯」的人，定知道有許多理直氣壯的道理，基實是錯了前提，或擲地有聲的雄文，與事實相距若干道里。　如「要救國必需喝開水」！或「大人物必定先咬菜根」，這只好歸入鬼話一類了，並批評亦無從下手。次焉者，閃閃　　，好像變魔術，五花八門之論調甚多，上下古今，無所不包，「油條燒餅呀」！「國事如着象棋呀」！沒有淸晰的腦筋，加以鋒利的剖晰，是要被其　昏的。至若扭扭揑揑，學着些油腔滑調，詭詐之態可掬，求自圓其說也不可能，便是下焉者了。</p>
<p>夫將叛者，其辭慙；中必疑者，其辭枝；吉人之辭寡；躁人之辭多；誣善之人，其辭游；失其守者，其辭屈·······古人也深懂看文章和聽演說。許多靑年們不知世故、然也知道看文章，審眞僞，辨人鬼，那種感覺那兒來的呢？難道是純潔靈魂的光芒，可以照見鬼祟麽？然則古往今來許多欺世盗名者流，到底要逃到何處去呢？</p>
<h3>馬來旅感</h3>
<p>— 岳明</p>
<p>在異國旅行，似乎總很容易惹起異國情調吧。但在馬來聯邦的車上，却並不然了。一路看見的，幾乎全是中國老鄉，只是除了幾個查票的馬來人。車廂裏，進門，便看見「謹防掱手」的中國字。　到了一個車站，掉頭窗外，在旅客擁的肩上，就赫然現出中英合璧的地名牌子。沿途來的鄕間茅屋，首先耀在眼簾前的，却是門上貼着兩條土紅的春聯。市鎭的街道，也是帶着許多方塊字的布招，一瞥地飛了過去。</p>
<p>「馬來亞的繁榮，是不得不歸功於中國人呵」！不知先前在什麽遊記上，還是華僑報紙的論文上，看見了這麽一句，已經忘記得乾乾凈凈的，現在又重新溜進我的腦裏了。我是依坐在窗口，睜着貪饞的眼睛，攝取着睡在炎天下的馬來原野的。</p>
<p>天下的馬來原野的。</p>
<p>鄰座嘈　地談着生意經，偶然聽着一兩句頽唐而怨憤的話。</p>
<p>「從前呵，要賣一二百元的，現在，丢那媽，只値一二十元了」！</p>
<p>我知道這講的是樹膠，歐戰時候許多人藉此發了財，現在隨着世界的經濟恐慌，膠價大形跌落，怨聲載道，這是必然的。</p>
<p>沿途的山野，幾乎全是人造的樹膠林子，只是有些地方現出掩不住的荒凉，接取膠汁的人不知那兒去了，樹脚下長着深深的蔓草。偶然也可以看見十里的山林，燒得光光的，焦黑的枒幹，倒處躺着，彷彿戰塲一樣，倘若再點綴一些殘肢斷體的話，依窓而望的遠方過客，就會禁不住起着憑吊之感吧？　　車過吉隆坡，上來一大批中國老鄉，携着簡單的行李，說是要回廣東去的。他們不潔的衣衫，憂鬱的臉子，圍在我的週遭，使我記起了「富貴而歸故鄉」的古語，心呵便和他們的心，一樣地哀愁起來了。</p>
<p>你們的手，曾經繁榮過馬來亞的；</p>
<p>你們的血，曾經肥胖肥過馬來亞的；</p>
<p>現在馬來亞瘦弱了，凋零了，</p>
<p>歸去吧，不要留戀，不要惜别！</p>
<p>然而，入夜猶馳的火車，奔到ＴａｎｋＲｏａｄ車站時，跳舞着的星加坡呵，歌唱着的星加坡呵，酒醉了</p>
<p>的星加坡呵，却一陣子包圍攏來，迷昏了我，我悄悄地想；</p>
<p>「馬來亞仍舊是繁榮的呵！我不願歸去的」！</p>
<p>但不久终於和那批老鄉一樣，黯然歸國了，這是在一九三一年春天的時候。</p>
<h3>無窗室</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>搬下來了，我搬下來了從那座摩天的石頭樓上，像一隻黃鸝蹬開了喬木，一頭棲下了萬丈的幽谷。</p>
<p>在樓頭，我的心曬不上太陽，望望海濤，我拍一下窒息的胸膛，</p>
<p>我身邊死釘着一個鬼影，白天黑夜一點也不放鬆。　　我閉上了這一扇門扉，四壁一齊洩下了光輝，一雙黑手搯煞了世界，在這裏邊我呼吸着自在。</p>
<h3>浴室内外（續）</h3>
<p>— 家明</p>
<p>「沒有，你的意思······」</p>
<p>「我的意思是大家去喝喝茶，吃些點心，你沟沒有旁的事嗎？」</p>
<p>洗完澡，肚裏是慣常地會感到餓的。我答應了。</p>
<p>在濃霧中，我看着他的豐滿的背，豐滿的腿，在溚室的門外隠去了。</p>
<p>我把溫暖的水，漸漸地增加到最熱的熱度，淋在我的胸上，背上。用力擦着全身的皮層。到那熱度髙到不能忍受的時候，我把熱水管關了，讓最冰冷的水淋遍了我的全身，又混身的擦了一頓之後，我把帶進來的一塊小毛巾稍爲揩拭了一下子，便趿着草拖鞋走到外面去。</p>
<p>我很細心地去找　我的朋友，一直等到一個站在鏡前的穿着灰色短衣的人向我大聲喚着陸先生的時候，我方把他辯認出來。</p>
<p>他正在鏡前梳着頭髮。一壁向我說着零碎的話。他穿的是一套灰色的短衣褲，一雙黑布鞋子。</p>
<p>不知怎的，我心裏有些害怕起來。我細看他的面孔，那一雙濃的眉毛，眉梢像流露着兇狠的光芒，下面的一撮短鬚，顯然是隠藏一個奸滑的笑，一對細的眼睛，時時向我打量，好像是不懷好意似的。單看他這一身的裝束，就完全不像個善類。</p>
<p>我立刻悔恨自已結識這一個朋友的錯誤。我想起他剛才所說的茶房愉客人銀夾的故事，心裏更着慌起來。我怕這回是個聲東擊西的計劃。悄悄地在穿衣服的時候摸摸自已的口袋，發現那五十元依然無恙時，心裏才稍爲舒服一點。</p>
<p>他在我旁等着我穿衣服，我嘴裏一壁和他應酬着，心裏一壁盤算怎樣想個方法來　脫他。他約我同去喝茶，我想這一定是個陷阱。</p>
<p>穿好了衣服，大家一齊出來，我裝作要關照家裏一聲，便借着那辦事處的電話打着。</p>
<p>我沒有撥凖那一個號碼，我握着電話，自已嘴裏說着問答的話，裝作傾聽的樣子，又裝作驚異的神情，然後我放下了聽筒，告訴我身邊站着的那個人，說我家裏有點重要的事情，我得馬上回去，並表示我不能和他一塊去喝茶的歉意。</p>
<p>我沒有聽淸楚他回答我的是一些什麽話，便迅速地走出馬路，像逃脫了的俘虜似的，立刻跳上一部黃包車，指着剛和到我家的相反的方向，催促着車夫加快點脚步拉去。</p>
<h3>北平素描（七）市口之夜</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>北平的市面比上海收的早得多。隆冬時候不必說；現在天氣已漸漸暖和了，收市仍然很早。譬如王府井大街東安市塲一帶，也算得北平數一數二的熱閙區域，但在晚上九十點鐘之後也就冷淸淸地，在夜的帳幕裏睡着了。</p>
<p>這時東安市塲外的十字路口只剩下疏朗朗的幾個過路人，幾輛洋車懶洋洋地在那裏　　。幾處鬼火似的燈光照着小攤上的食物│烙餅，猪頭肉，窩窩頭·········熒熒地在那裏挑逗洋車夫的食慾。</p>
<p>「嘩啷！」四個大铜子從一隻瘦黑的手中　到一個小攤上。　　　　的遞一個「窩窩頭」到這黑手掌裏，這黑手掌立刻掣到一張亂蓬蓬長着短髭的嘴邊。　　「有今天下鍋的猪頭肉······不嘗一塊？」</p>
<p>「···嗐！」短髭的嘴嚥下了窩窩頭，開始說話了。「···不要說牠了！拉了一晚上，只拉了二十枚（註一）。那兒彀吃肉的？」</p>
<p>「先吃了，回頭再算罷。眞光電影不是快散了嗎？」擺攤的順手遞過了一塊油光光的猪頭肉。</p>
<p>眞光電影院門口停着幾十輛汽車和包車，這時還沒有動靜；牠們的主子們還在那裏鑑賞ＧｒｅｔａＧａｒｂｏ親嘴的姿勢，或在西邊吉祥戲院裏喝楊小樓的「門簾采」。</p>
<p>猪頭肉已落了肚，兩條腿不得不踅向眞光門口去等着。好容易候了一個鐘頭，電影終久散了，男男女女從門裏湧出來。笑語，吆喝，汽車的喇叭，洋車夫喉嚨│一片亂雜雜的交響樂激破了死寂的空氣。但看電影的人並不擁擠，片刻之間都散盡了；振　的擾攘像輕烟一般寂滅，寂滅，周圍的空氣又黑沉地凝合成一團。</p>
<p>「泡啦！」（註二）短髭的嘴裏發出了粗重的聲音，黑瘦的手沒精打采地倒曳着車杠，又踅回到小攤邊。「泡啦！」</p>
<p>「等着吉祥散戲吧。」擺攤的臉上露着同情的苦笑。</p>
<p>「倒是有人雇，可沒有拉成，」短髭的搖着頭說··「到報國寺│多遠的路│只出三十枚！我說一毛錢都不要！他奶奶的！泡啦！」</p>
<p>風漸漸地大了，挾着塵土和寒冷，在市口狂肆。吉祥散戲了！又是一陣　　又慢慢地沉寂起來了。看看人快散完了，這短髭的還沒有找到一個雇主。「泡了！」他心裏充滿着慌急。</p>
<p>「洋車！」一個最後散出來的人吆喝着。「報國寺。」</p>
<p>「兩毛錢吧。」</p>
<p>「二十枚。」這人一面說，一面只顧向西走。</p>
<p>「一毛錢吧···先生···有十二三里地哪···」</p>
<p>「二十四枚。」這人走遠了。　　「四十枚要不要？」</p>
<p>「二十六枚。」</p>
<p>「泡啦！」車夫咬着牙望着這條空闊的街。忽然他向前追上去，喘着氣兒喊道··「拉二十六枚的！」</p>
<p>他拉了這二十六枚的雇主，跑過賒猪頭肉給他的小攤，向擺攤的打個招呼··「明兒給你吧！」幾分鐘後，他滯重的脚聲遠得聽不見了。</p>
<p>夜深了。市口沉寂得像死。</p>
<p>（註一）二十枚就是十枚大铜子，合大洋四分。</p>
<p>（注二）「泡啦！」北平洋車夫的「行話」，意思與「糟了」相似，上海人所謂「拆　　空老壽星」也。</p>
<h3>旅程</h3>
<p>— 公孫旻</p>
<p>瘦老的馬，</p>
<p>載着沉重的行裝！</p>
<p>人在征途上。</p>
<p>策馬的長鞭，</p>
<p>劃破了黃昏，</p>
<p>描上淡淡的新月一痕。</p>
<p>道旁搖曳的柳絲，</p>
<p>挑起旅人煩惱；</p>
<p>平添了鄉愁不少。</p>
<p>望着白雲悠渺，誰能知道歸期？</p>
<p>思量徒增悽感！</p>
<p>讓晚風吹動着</p>
<p>單薄的衣裳，</p>
<p>倦旅的人入了萝鄕。</p>
<p>「火要燒到眉毛上來了！」</p>
<h3>半天的功課（八）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>爲這國歌，我一想就生氣，說東北三千萬人「無苦無憂，」「並無怨仇，」那是祗能騙鬼的！事實是最好的雄辯，東北三千萬人，是不會上你的當，不會受你的麻醉的！</p>
<p>接着是許多要人的演說，無非是一些欺人的鬼話，隨後在一陣熱烈的掌聲中，日本領事起來說話了···</p>
<p>「本領事今天得以參與貴國的這般盛會，實在覺得榮幸！推其原故，由於這兩個紀念日非常難得，在歷史上有着重大的意義。</p>
<p>「先說九·一八。九·一八可以脫日本帝國替貴國開基的日子，············帝國因與滿蒙有同文同種關係，彼此原爲一家，唇亡齒寒，故不顧别國之怨聲惡言，毅然退出國聯············本帝國旣開貴國成立之端，當然要承認之於後，因在去年本日，外務省行文貴國外文部，實行承認，此九·一五之由來也。············貴國人於慶祝此盛會之時，似應由貴國之成立而念及本帝國之義擧，············日滿兩國必須到「日滿恊和，共存共榮」的地步，·········」</p>
<p>演說完畢，台下的日本小學生，瘋狂地拍手，舞旗，他從容地走下台去。</p>
<p>别人我不知道怎樣，我自已呢，聽着這番演說時，週身是一陣冷，一陣熱，我沒有旁的希望，我祗是希望我自已頓時變成一顆炸彈，使滿塲的人，敵我同歸於盡！</p>
<p>講演台上還有些什麽樣人說話，我全不知道，我太激昻了，我太憤怒了，但忽然，我的頭頂上起了一陣轟隆的爆音，兩架日本飛機，從天空撒下大批的傳單。人羣騷動了，爭着拾取落下來的紙片。我順便搶了一張·題名呌「新滿洲」。</p>
<p>又是一大篇肉麻騙人的話。</p>
<p>本來很沉悶的會塲，因爲暫時的騷動，倒顯得活躍些，不，還是說散漫些好一點。學生隊伍中，有坐在地下的，甚至有些人撕下小國旗和傳單擦着鼻涕。那種不耐煩的樣子，一看就知道大家在盼望快快完了道個塲面。好出一胸中的悶氣。</p>

<h3>期粉多頭頗有回出</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥互有四分之上落、坎拿大小八分、當開價時、以業内外之購買、依然淸淡、並以時局謠言、多頭更具戒心、近遠各月份、均見軟象、迨至下午開盤、客帮多頭、頗有回出、一部分小廠、對本月份又有出檔、故成交雖不多、市勢則又趨軟弱也、照目下情形、終因各地之經濟枯燥、不能引起業外之興趣、致市面不免呈長疲短俏之局也、結果本月份較小七厘半、五月份小一分、六七月份小一分二厘半、八月份小二厘半、九月份小五厘、</p>
<h3>期麥依然沉寂　現貨尙熱閙···共開五千一百包</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、均見沉寂之態、本月份因有實際籌碼關係、賣買更少、遠期則以天氣睛雨不常、新麥年收、又少把握、形勢雖不佳、大量之抛貨、尙須有待、交易之淸淡、當屬此故、結果六月份上午小三分、下午回好二分、八月份好一分、現麥交易熱閙、價亦平穏、開瑤灣麥三元五角二分、山東麥三元五角七分、通州麥三元四角、蚌埠麥三元四角半、宿遷麥三元五角三分、碭山麥三元五角七分、共開五千一百包由阜豐去一千八百包、華豐去一千八百包、福新去一千八百包云</p>

<p>昨客秈市况、到銷兩活、市面仍居活潑之象到頭續有湖南沙市南京江北等處裝到、去胃仍以閩帮最旺、昨又有溫州暢辦、市面愈形轉俏、惟貨主求售甚亟、行情乃與前市無大出入也、全日溫州辦法去湖南機靖一千包、福州辦去沙市糙米二千五百包、江北南京江西各機米一千零二十五包、泉州辦去機紅米三百包、機元米二百包、行情均與前市相似、後形仍看活潑挺站之局、</p>

<p>昨黃豆市價、提升三四分、統市成交車輪各豆二十二三車、廠家辦去十七八車、本街及出口帮豆去四五車、來源依然不湧、連電又報續升、所以賣買雙方之心思、在此醞醲局面中、一致轉採、杜豆沙黃因去路仍寥、續居疲局、昨成交杜緊七十包、及沙黃一百包、均爲本街採去、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市疲漸如故</h3>
<p>海外各絲織廠手中日絲存底充厚、一時無須外求、華絲去電不轉、進口商囤積之黃白廠經、無人問訊、滬埠各歐莊均觀望不動昨衹達昌進白廠經十包、杭綢廠亦進二十包、價仍平疲、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵客銷活潑</h3>
<p>會司鐵新近客帮生意、已見發展、故連日成交頗稱活潑、行情薄箱每箱開二十七元五角、厚箱每箱二十七元、查交易昨開出六七百箱之多、而本街開出亦有五百餘箱、是以市情殊甚良佳、據連日海外來電、現貨甚少、况售盤又髙、所以本埠行情、後市恐無回小之望、</p>
<h3>英馬口鐵來貨絡繹</h3>
<p>近幾日來英馬口鐵、到貨已覺絡繹、故堆存在浦東浦西各洋棧已達三四千箱之多、但行情一節、因到本低廉、所以開價較廉、計九十磅　十四元五角、一百磅十五元二角半、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>婦女與職業</h3>
<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>前幾些時，有某人在某女學校演說，題爲婦女與職業。也說，婦女最好的職業是嫁人。這問題曾引起不少人辯論。我以爲這正是某君所謂「幽默」的說法。現社會誰個女子不以「嫁人」爲唯一的職業呢？什麽爲社會，爲國家，總不過是騙人的話頭。歸根結蒂，最後還是嫁人。不過有此事實人人不願明白說出。待至某君一明白講出，人人便以爲奇談了。而其實正是目前的事實！</p>
<p>事實上目前的女子，確是個以嫁人爲其唯一職業。儘管是求學也好，從事社會活動也好，最後還是嫁人。嫁人是一切女子歸宿點。固然，固然，女子是應該要與人結婚的，結婚並非職業，然而現在女子的結婚，却不是爲着結婚，而是爲着「衣食有所靠」。就是爲着職業。不看嗎？所有的女子，嫁了人，做了太太，誰個不就與社會立刻脫離關係？除出電影院跳舞摥及一切樂交際摥所外，簡直不易看到她們的影踪（自然，这是指有錢人太太而言，卽前述某君演說，也是對有錢女子而言。）這便是婦女以嫁人爲唯一職業的明證。因爲，這時她們已經嫁人了，不必再需什麽社會活動，衣食自然無虞。就是，現在她們已經得到職業了。女子所以以嫁人爲其唯一職業，其要義便在於此。</p>
<p>然則，女子眞的是以嫁人爲最好的職業嗎？當然不是的。這不過是這社會所表現的一時現象。因爲這社會女子根本是一個男子的附屬物，女子也變成了商品的一種。所以女子才不能不以嫁人爲其唯一最好的職業。假使女子能脫離男子附物的地位，能從太太的地位，解放而成爲社會上的人，則女子便無所用其以嫁人爲唯一最好的職業。她自有獨立的能力，自有活動的機會。自能衝破金錢的桎梏，走到大社會中來，做一個完全人格的人。自然，這是將來社會的事。</p>
<p>而這將來社會的實現，却有待於女子們的努力。不獨女子要努力，卽站在時代前的男性戰士，也應一同努力。本來，這是整個社會問題解决中之一部分，原不能分孰先孰後，孰重孰輕；整個社會問題解决，一切都得解决。而在這中間，女子更當爲其本身問題而更加倍努力。因爲這是她們切身的問題。</p>
<p>先進的女子們，注意着這個問題！怎樣從禮敎的，金錢的桎梏中解放出來，成爲一個社會上的人，這是大家要仔細考慮着的！須知，「嫁人是女子唯一最好的職業」，這是一個恥辱！現代女子們最大的恥辱！怎樣從這個恥辱中奮鬥出來，這是時代爲婦女們的責任！</p>
<h3>新華一日</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>我喜歡音樂，從前常和我的英文先生李小姐到市政廳去聽音樂。她彈得一手的披亞諾，以爲我這個學生多少能來一點胡琴之類，然而我竟是個分不出「獨來米」的外行音樂家。她曾好奇的問我··「不懂聽着有什麽趣味？」我的回答是正因爲我不懂，纔喜歡聽音樂。我還喜歡跳舞，ＢｌａｃｋＣａｔ在大光明隔壁的時候，我每晚獨自兒去「坐桌子」，聽音樂，瞧人家跳，被朋友們知道了，一定强逼我「下海」，從此我不敢進跳舞塲，我以爲瞧人家跳不是很好的嗎？這一種被人家認爲的怪脾氣，我博得了一個「溫呑水」的綽號；其實他們不瞭解我。　　昨天承金佩魚先生邀我去參觀新華歌劇社，我欣然地允諾了。一個不知道太陽是什麽東西的夜游神，今天居然在九點鐘起床。春風醉人的拂着我的衣襟，我們的汽車向善鐘路進發，幾年來不見太陽了，幾年來不見春的早晨了，我悠悠然像恢復到孩子時代放風箏的時候，我不信一個二十四幾的靑年怎彷彿一個垂死的老人呢！</p>
<p>敲了美華里四號的門，五個指頭全被染黑了，我對於新華不貼一張油漆未乾的字條認爲遺憾。踏進門去，咱們（同鄉的親切稱呼）的章文小姐喊着一二三四的在敎授那····？就是瞧人家跳的跳舞。因爲急於上樓，我不能坐桌子喝一杯咖啡茶。二樓是男社員的臥室；三樓是女的，不，是小姐們的。一律是錭鐵半床，白的單被，顔色的被頭，如其早上在床上練習晨操，我可以介紹給體育影片的導演，這是一個很美的新鏡頭，外行老歡喜說外行話。</p>
<p>最近好像簽名簿很流行，我這個不會時髦的老實人，也藏了一冊小小簿子，到處綁票。自然，這裏的富藏寳庫，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>豈肯輕易放過。有兩位小姐的簽字是··　　别辜負你的靑春（徐健）</p>
<p>别辜負你現在的黃金時代（嚴斐）</p>
<p>感謝兩位小姐的提醒我。我已不知道我的靑春的存在了，我被生活的担子重重地壓迫着，我是個爲生活而生活的機械，靑春，黃金時代，像烟一般的在我生命史飛散了，牠永不有歸來的一天！</p>
<p>果報照彰，天理循環，小册子藏到袋裏，漂亮來些（嚴華先生，這是上海話）的簿子也已放在我的面前。我想我的眞蹟常常埋沒在字紙簏裏，似乎太可惜，現在可以有大筆揮的機會了。不過對於嚴華先生的覺得太沒有意思（字倒底還是很好的）想改··</p>
<p>我愛聽你的你不在說不，</p>
<p>收個外行的音樂家罷，</p>
<p>請你</p>
<p>你不要說··「不！」</p>
<p>題在朱健先生（卽吹泡泡）的卷首是··</p>
<p>在家靠父母，</p>
<p>出外靠朋友。</p>
<p>有位歐陽予倩的姪女飛莉中姐，她</p>
<p>允許了我（讀者别誤會這句的意思）而沒有寫一個字。我這個人是那樣氣量小的，爲了報復起見，介紹她的軼字。</p>
<p>飛莉小姐誰都呌她標凖神經，。據說她那個（這是新的代名詞）之後，近乎發了一天瘋，而那「瘋」的姿勢，够得上一聲頂括括（老　娘，這三個字是這樣寫嗎？）的標凖，此標凖神經之所由來也。</p>
<p>現在該說到感謝嚴華兄妹及全體社員（老　娘因嗓音失潤缺席。有人問我老　娘是誰，我不知道，怕吃白果也。一到我們新聲電臺來播音，你不要說不唱得眞够味。（譚派）出來大隊人馬浩浩蕩蕩直奔東方飯店而來，因爲我愛聽你不要說不的緣故。由宋偉先生和葉英小姐敎授我。外行音樂家眞聰敏，兩個鐘頭學成了一半，照正比例推算，再兩個鐘頭就行了嗎，請注意初試新聲的日期，大慨唱起來一定好，你聽了，你不要說···不···！</p>
<p>晚上丁悚老畫師，太太，公子等都從標飯店來，綁了老小畫師的字畫，這無論如何我記着，簽字，簽字。有位銀漢雙星中紫羅蘭的爸爸來了個餘興，滑稽的歌唱，法國式的表演，及一連串的「潑里士」，老家瞧他很快活，不像爲皇后（皇帝的妻子）的事，「那個」。（新的代名詞出典在此）可惜許多人以爲我認識他而沒有介紹。</p>
<p>意興闌珊的時候，已是三點鐘，咱因府上鐵門已閉，獨自住在旅館裏。追隨了新華一天，這時候反睡不熟覺，站在洋臺上瞧日出，那太陽確是從東方升起來的，我瞧淸楚了。不能到名勝地方去旅行的窮朋友，我十分誠意的請你在太陽出來之前到曬台上（自然不能永遠靠在東方飯店的洋台上）靜坐，至低限度不亞於泰山的日觀峯。</p>
<h3>聘請校醫</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>一位兼同學同鄉之誼的醫生朋友│惠民君，於四年前總算得了學士位，在國立的醫科專門學校畢了業。</p>
<p>一個人吃飯穿衣尙可儉節，但是得了病却少不了醫生，有此學士頭銜，雖說沒有留學，那怕就不是Ｄｏｃｔｏｒ麽，當時我們都替他這樣慶幸。</p>
<p>其實，這竟是「少不更事」的見解，當惠民結束他黃金時代的學生生活後，便感受到敎育制度與社會組織間的隔閡，跟被人推入深滿樣的走入社會。</p>
<p>日漸破産的家庭對他是懷着莫大的熱望，每年節衣縮食的撙儉，將大部份的收入來供給他求學，毫無怨言。在畢業後來滬找一個安靜優厚的事作·旣可自給·尙可養家·這是惠民家中的想望了。</p>
<p>體點到家庭的苦心，惠民也帶着這一希望跑出了學校。但是人世茫茫，竟有似無邊的　海，要到醫院裏去謀一個職務麽，旣無人緣，也沒有擢據他的親戚；設法自已懸壺經營一個小小的診所麽，沒有那樣的經濟力量；就此回家麽，不說好幾年的苦學付諸流水，更難塂的是受不着鄉里故舊的恥笑。</p>
<p>就這樣，惠民這裏碰那兒撞，　留在這都市裏，幾年不曾正式解决他的職業，過着飢饖的半失業生活。</p>
<p>幾年中在生活的鞭笞之下，惠民的要求已由兼醫生開診所降低，能够在那個學校任敎職較醫也算好了。一天在報紙上看到聘請校醫的廣告，他滿懷着這樣的熱望跑去接洽。</p>
<p>忍着門房的一種輕蔑的質問，惠民被引導到一間敎員休息室辦公室兩用的屋裏，門房回明事務主任來客造訪的意思後，退了出去。事務主任道了一聲請坐，不着的用眼光來打量這一新的來客。</p>
<p>「你先生貴姓？」主人問。</p>
<p>「姓　。」</p>
<p>「貴處？」</p>
<p>「　　省。」</p>
<p>「以前在甚麽學校······？」</p>
<p>「醫科專門學校畢業。」惠民感到成了堂下被審　的囚徙，有些不安和羞憤。</p>
<p>「啊，那很好···」事務主任脥了脥眼繼續說··「不過我們學校校醫事情很麻煩，學生多，先生恐怕···。」</p>
<p>「那不要緊，請先生講講貴校情形。」</p>
<p>「我們一起四校，中學部和小學部總共八百多人，每禮拜一校辦公兩次，</p>
<p>一次三點鐘，另外···。」</p>
<p>「四校？」</p>
<p>「對了，四校合請校醫一位，另外本校兩點鐘生理衛生。」</p>
<p>惠民聽了事務主任的話，心想想每禮拜一校六點，四六二十四個鐘頭，再加任課兩小時共二十六小時，已經超出一切中學敎員的任課時間了，同時加以人數之多，學校的分散，如何來得及？但是總比閑着好，因問；</p>
<p>「人這麽多，又不一道，對於學生恐怕···」</p>
<p>「那沒啥，反正不過每期檢查檢查身體，每禮拜看視看視，那會學校眞的成了醫院哩···哈哈···」事務主任的笑是言中有意。</p>
<p>「如此說來，貴校的待遇···？」客人問。</p>
<p>「這就得商量了，敝校因經費支拙，只能···只能每期奉酬四十元。」事務主任的臉突然轉得很嚴峻。</p>
<p>客人只是望着對方發怔。</p>
<p>「這自然僅算補助零用，先生願意時，是帶盡義務性質。」</p>
<p>「啊！盡義務性質。」</p>
<p>惠民君心裏恍然，告辭出來，後面小院中喧燥着學生呌閙的聲音。</p>

<h3>銷沉的民族</h3>
<p>— 伯融</p>
<p>最近的報紙，差不多整篇都成了動觀中國的寫照，雖然這寫照還不十分淸晰，使我們能對整個民族社會作個周密而深刻的觀察，可是僅從那斷片的字句間略加思索之後，便足使我們不寒而慄，在這種嚴重的環境中，我們該多麽奮發自勵，從現實中深刻地意識到自身的使命與前途。而進一步把實力培養充實，作爲復興民族之凖備。</p>
<p>可是當我們再觀察一下之後，我們該更奇詫地發覺，在這包藏千萬人的大都市中，實藏有極不相同的相反的兩面，一方面，市面蕭條，商店紛紛倒閉，工廠停工，失業者日益增加，可是另一方面，電影院與舞塲愈開愈多，奢侈品的進口有增無减，整個社會沉溺這一種頽廢享樂的病態空氣裏，不回顧過去，不憧憬未來，只追求刹那間瘋狂樣的享受；這兩種現象的對立，實顯示出整個社會之莫大的危機，凡是生存在這社會中的人，都該把牠加以一番思索和考慮的。</p>
<p>帝國資本主義的侵略，使我們農村經濟破産，中世紀的手工業顯然不能與神奇的近代機械爭雄，可是另一方面，新勃興的民族資本主義正須加意培護，然而帝國主義的勢力却把這一綫生機完全摧毁了。他們帶給我們的是什麽呢？肉感電影，香檳酒，髙價香烟，華貴衣料，化裝品，以及一切使我們走向毁滅的東西，他們的心理是惟恐我們奮發，不惜用一切手段把這些毒素灌輸進我們民族的血液裏去，可是我們的同胞│特别是那般養尊處優的髙等華人│却沒有覺悟到這些，不，不是他們不覺悟，僅只是對這嚴肅的現象故意閉着眼睛罷了。他們的家庭是洋貨推銷廠，他們的身體是洋貨的廣告架，他們全部生活是洋化的生活，整個租界成了古羅馬的市塲，荒淫，奢靡，蕩佚，嬌惰，頽廢，這些沒有靈魂沒有生命力的人，有什麽資格擔當復興民族的艱鉅而偉大的工作？　　帝國主義的侵略是不可怕的，可怕的只是我們自身的銷沉，因了我們的銷沉，遂使帝國主義肆無忌憚地施行他們的陰謀與毒策。我們試想想東北同胞的苦痛，全國農村的動亂與災荒，大都市經濟危機的深刻，我們會不讓生活急轉直下地沉溺不去，而堅决地把自已意志培植起來；現實是殘酷的，無視現實的是愚妄，逃避現實的是懦弱，只有正面凝視現實而加以眞摯改造的，纔是人類生活中之强者。</p>
<p>我們的民族正如一個呻吟牀第的病人，對於這個病人，美肴是沒用的，猛劑是有傷的，我們需要一貼固本培元恢復健康的補藥。</p>

<h3>暹羅漫譚（九）</h3>
<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>暹羅僑敎之所以不發達不外下述兩種原因··第一是學費太貴，那邊的學校，都是每月收費的，平均一個月要四元暹幣。一年以十二個月計（寒暑假中也要繳費的），就是要四十八元，再加上書籍文具及各種雜費等，每年非七十元不可。如果以中國錢來計算的話，那就是一百二三十元。這還是走讀的，要是寄宿生，更是貴得驚人，華僑究竟不是個個有錢的，試問這樣貴的學費，呌他們如何擔負得起？第二，是一部份家長的糊塗，因爲他們大都是不識字的，以爲不讀書一樣可以發財，何必要把子女送到學校裏去，像這一類的人，實是也是不少。</p>
<p>曼谷是僑胞最多的地方，所以敎育也比較内地發達些。其中如廣屬的廣肇，潮屬的培英，瓊屬的育民，客屬的進德，和閩屬的培元等，要算是最早設立的。但這許多所謂公立學校，都有一種共同通病，就是校董們的干涉學校行政。不僅是敎職員的進退，要由他們决定，就是添置幾本圖書這一類極細微的事，也都要得到他們的同意。校董肯負責，原是一種可喜的現象，但不客氣的講，他們對於敎育大都是門外漢。所以經濟雖然很充足，但總辦不出什麽好成續來。</p>
<p>最近幾年，私立學校發展得很快。他們因爲沒有校董的牽制，而敎員大都是由國内去的靑年，所以很有生氣。其中最努力的，要算新民，崇實，　魂，以及去年新辦的華中，南洋等幾校，他們除了在敎導方面肯虛心研究，不斷的改進外，對於整個的僑社，確也有了相當的貢獻。好像　　　　　　　　　　實行男女同校等，都是收到了很好的効果。近年來僑胞的風氣較前開通，私立學校的功勞實不在小。</p>

<h3>關於「烈燄的評價」及其他（下）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>其次，木天先生深知道僅僅是咒咀電影作家，還不足以毁滅中國電影，更進一步的必須對於電影批評也得掃蕩無遺，才能「天下太平」，於是他「更擺出神乎其氣的面孔來」，「與以大的摧殘」。</p>
<p>關於這些，我只想以事實來回答。就我之記憶所及，「鐵板紅淚錄」開映的當時，一般的影評，並沒有誰「苛刻」到「近於駡得一錢不値」。我們並不像他所說的因爲「編劇者導演者到四川農村去找材料，不一味的避難就易地去取材於狹小的江南」，就是「値得過髙評價」的地方，反之，我們以爲劇作者能够抓住反封建勢力反苛捐雜稅爲主題，正是「鐵板紅淚錄」十分可取之處。但是木天先生却有意巧辯，說是「駡得一錢不値」，直不知何以云然？當然我們知道他是一個藝術家，他該不會忽視導演者沒有將更好的表現方法將充實的内容電影藝術的地表現出來，這是一般影評人非常惋惜的缺點。而他却不知何所根據「竟拿出小八義式的武俠精神···打不平了」。</p>
<p>同樣，關於「烈焰」，我所知道的各報的批評，誰也沒有「寛大的很而近於歌功頌德」，很實際的指出了他的好處，也指出了他的壞處，並不像木天先生祇看到「阿貞的水零零的眼睛眞是風騷到百分之二百」以及「種菜調情」，而忽視鼓勇千百萬勞苦大衆去撲滅帝國主義的火焰。這「駡得一錢不値」，祇有所謂「前進大詩人」才有如此破口大駡的用心和勇氣。在這裏我不懂誰「不知道那裏是作品的進步性？那裏是作的退步性」？事實上他是「對於好的傾向與以障礙。　　再說到「春蠶」罷，那末當時不免有人因着期望過殷，認爲好者不必稱讚，盡人皆知，而缺點却不能不全部指出，以促作者之進步，這應當是極彰明較著的事實，難道還有什麽惡意在嗎？可是及至我們自我批判的發見了自已之錯誤的時候，卽是說因爲如此便引起了觀衆之悞會的時候，於是我們很虛心的誠懇的糾正了我們自已的錯誤，難道這就是所謂「再評價的笑話」麽？我以爲「過而能改」不會比「知過不改」更可怕。何况「春蠶」的不大衆化，「春蠶」的缺乏劇的成份，已經成爲衆所公認的結論。假使說像他所主張的和小說的原文一模一様，那只有髙貴而兼前進的诗人才可看懂了。</p>
<p>至於最令他痛心的關於唐吉訶德的批評，更是與事實恰恰相反。可不是麽，他大駡「中國影評家之無常識，連世界文學的Ａ·Ｂ·Ｃ·都不曉得」，不像他「買了一本歐洲文學發達史」，而且還「看上三二十分鐘」，所以便「明白個大概」。但是事實上當時各報的批評，幾乎全部是以他「明白個大概」的歐洲文學發達史作參考的。事實俱在，爲什麽他要如此巧辯呢？而且當時曾有影刋爲之出特刋，各方面都有介紹，難道說木天先生是不看報的嗎？我以爲他也「至少應有常識。」</p>
<p>最後我要說到的，便是侯楓先生他似乎在敲邊鼓的客觀的帮助着他打擊環境所要打擊的中國電影批評，這和髙明之流的行爲有什麽兩樣呢？我眞佩服他們十字軍的勇氣。但是我相信中國電影批評决不會因此而毁滅啊，中國電影批評始終要帮助中國電影打開一切枷鎖，邁步前進！（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「春宵苦短」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＢｒｉｅｆＭｏｍｅｎｔ│南京│</p>
<p>自有了華納公司的「亡命者」之後，心中始終留着一種慘痛而悲憤的印象。的確，那是一個好萊塢電影王國中了不起的偉構。我想凡是看了那一部作品的觀衆們，該不否認它偉大的存在吧。所以，我謹以至誠推薦「亡命者」於上海的觀衆之前，因爲那是値得鑒賞的影片，當你們將必然的在其中獲得許多賓貴的東西的時候。</p>
<p>但是，我想當我們看過了上述一片之後，再去看其他庸俗的美國影片的時候，也許會感覺失望吧。至少在我，對於這哥倫比亞公司的「春宵苦短」，就不免在比較之下而失望了。</p>
<p>當然，這决不是毫無理由的主觀的武斷，事實上，在内容的評價上，就是一部相當空虛而毫無嚴肅性的。當我看到銀幕上映着Ｅｎｄ的時候，我立刻聯想到「浪子回頭一塊金」的俗語。眞的，全篇可以這一句話包括，而劇作者所加重的祇　說明浪子的回頭，主要的是爲了報答夫人的恩愛而已。</p>
<p>故事是這樣構成的··銀行家的少爺，揮金如土，愛上了一個歌女，居然廢除了所謂階級觀念而與之結婚。因爲他日常追逐於歌台舞榭之中，歌女屢次規諫不聽，卒與之離異。及後，少爺深感夫人情重，努力改過自新。於是破鏡重圓，夫妻恩愛如初。</p>
<p>這裏的主題是什麽呢？很顯明的，公子少爺，應當務正業，毌事治遊。在賢妻良母眼中，是爲了丈夫自已的前途，而在少爺自身，却是爲了夫人的規勸。這，無疑的是極舊的世界觀，所謂老生常談，不會使人討厭，但也不使人　奮。假使說這也有它的社會意羲存在，那末劇作者無非是敎富家兒郎們，不要自甘暴棄，以維持他們階級利益的存在。然而這也不過是可憐的幻想而已。</p>
<p>再說罷，這一影片是否有它的眞實性呢？那末在描寫ＬａｄｉｅｓａｎｄＧｅｎｔｌｅｍｅｎ的靡爛生活方面，的確是相當盡出了一個眞實的輪廓。他們的生活是，跳舞，香檳，女人，爵士音樂，跑馬，滑冰，坐汽車兜風，遊覽名勝，輪盤賭博。······他們不會懂得什麽是人生，他們厭惡工作而且也不必工作。他們有的是錢，只消在支票薄上簽上一個名。萬一支　　「小婦人」中開始時慶祝耶誕之一幕</p>
<p>绌的時候，自然有父兄供給他們。在這種情形之下，他們會覺悟到要爲社會服務嗎？我們看罷，少爺在父親的銀行裏抄賬的時候，他不能吃苦，到底是看跑馬去了。</p>
<p>然而這也僅僅是描寫了一點他們的生活而已。劇作者絕對沒有在他們的生活素描中展開舊的崩潰，或新的生長之現象。我們在這裏完全不能感覺那是崩潰着的必然現象。於是劇作遂行了他的任務，他不僅是對他們上層階級不加以打擊，而同時更極力維護他們的存在。假使有人說，當那少爺在找工作做，到處碰壁的時候，是否反映了失業恐慌呢？那末，我可以回答說，那不過爲了寫少爺立心爲善的决心，所以不妨來上那末一套。</p>
<p>導演在記述一個故事方面，多少是還淸顺的。但是鏡頭的有時濫用，却可證明他的不够修養。男女主角都無特長。特别是男主角的輕浮，誇大，更更幼稚，而女主角到還不過是不够而已。</p>
<h3>看了小婦人試片以後</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄</p>
<p>承大上海戲院之邀，於盼望了好幾個月的小婦人影片，得到先覩的快慰。當然，以曾經體會過又表現過劇中人個個心理的我，來看這張影片，親切自加人一等，然而，被奔放的和深蘊的情感所激動的恐怕已做了座了座中的江州司馬了。</p>
<p>劇本採取原書（小婦人和好妻子│在美國已合爲一本）的情節若干，却已蔚成大觀。凱瑟玲赫本湼扮飾中心人物，淋漓盡致。其餘諸人亦各能表出他們的個性。而馬叔婆的扮演，殊令人捧腹，轉足使情感的緊張，頓爲釋然。我知道看過我的譯本小婦人和好妻子的許多人欣然聽到這張影片的到臨，而急欲一睹。他們看了影片後，可以去一溫書中的情節，他們可以從此見到文學藝術和銀幕藝術的特點，見其不相奪而實相輔的。最近數月，我常見到美國的雜誌，如時評週報ＬｉｔｅｒａｒｙＤｉｇｅｓｔ和父母雜誌ＰａｒｅｎｔｓＭａｇａｚｉｎｅ均推重這張影片·彼邦民間許多影片審查機關均稱譽它，謂其富有敎育的價値。我今天看了覺得它確是値得贊頌的。我想小學生或者也能够欣賞（本片除了四個「小婦人」外，尙有小孩的幕片不少）至於曾受過中等敎育以上的人，更不必說了。此種懇摯，純潔，向上的影片，家庭與學校，似宜介紹給子弟們去一看，因爲原來小婦人和好妻子兩書，固不僅是文學的讀物，而也是敎育的讀物呢。</p>

<h3>鼙聲劍影錄（Ｎａｎａ（五）</h3>
<p>— 殷鳴</p>
<p>以地位而論，安特利是個大佐，而喬治不過是個少校，所以安特利用上司吩咐下屬的口氣道；「你現在立卽歸營報到。我不久就有命令送到你長官那裏。你的假期已經取銷。現在你爲皇家朋務，你須隨卽全隊開到亞幾利亞去。」喬治喊道；「安特利！你那能這樣對付我呢？安特利說道；喬治，我爲愛你的緣故，所以才這樣使你不至於終身墮落的。」他說著回到自已的屋了裏，着衣服去了。</p>
<p>隔了不久·安特利已經穿好衣服，他就跑過去看娜娜，那時娜娜還橫在床上，聽見有人敲門，有些不髙興理睬，但是敲門的聲音越東越緊越來越響了。娜娜曼聲道；「走開些，我還要睡覺哩。」安特利在門外說道；「我是穆發大佐。我要馬上就見你。」素伊被吵醒了，她就將安特利一帶帶到娜娜的房間裏。安特利進了房間，看見娜娜還沒有起床，就將一小包的東西放在她的床上。娜娜問他那是什麽。安特利道；「這就是你對於我兄弟一切愛情的全部代價，裏面有五萬法郎。你有了這個錢，你可以不必再和他在一起了。你看，我不是不等你開口，就給你了嗎？我的兄弟從此以後，亦不許再和你往了。他今天半夜就要出發到亞幾利亞去。我不能讓他將一生的前程輕輕抛棄了。」娜娜問道；「喬治知道你上我這裏來的嗎？」安特利道；「當然不知道。但是我這樣做法，完全是我愛他的緣故。」安特利說完了要走了，但是娜娜將他喊住了。她從床上跳了起來。她站在安特利的面前說道；「你這種頭腦狹隘的人，我本來不願意和你談論這件事。」她的聲音是極冷酷的，充滿着壓制住的盛怒。「但是，我親愛的大佐，你要知道，你的爲什麽要這樣做，並不是因爲你愛的兄弟。你這種人我亦看見過。他們終生度著僧侶的生活。你看看我！我是屬於屬治的，我愛他。他亦愛我。現在你要懲治你的兄弟，因爲我所有的，你連懂都不懂得。這就是你差處所在的地方。現在要證明我的話不差······」她說完了就在安特利的嘴上很命地吻了一下。　　「現在，我的大佐吓，娜娜吻完了冷笑着，「你知道你自已是怎樣的一個僞君子。多少年來，你的腦筋瞞着你的身體······呵呵······你愛你的兄弟。天曉得。你的錢拿了去。拿了滾蛋！我一生將記憶曾經碰着過你而自恨！」安特利受了這次大侮辱，垂頭喪氣地走了。在娜娜的一方面呢，她一些也不相信喬治會眞的離開她的，所以她對於安特利的這次訪問，過後亦就淡然忘之，並不當它是什麽大事。但是到了黃昏的時候，一輛馬車來了，停在她的門口，上面裝滿了行李，喬治從車子裏跳了出來。娜娜看着這種景况，都呆住了。他進來了。他將她抱住了，他很平靜地，很直爽地告訴她，他要出遠門了。（未完）</p>

<h3>President Wang Takes a Warship to Jiangxi; Chen Shaokuan and Zeng Zhongming Accompany Him; Expected to Meet with Chiang and Huang This Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang departed on the Zhongshan warship for Jiangxi on the 10th, accompanied by Chen Shaokuan, Zeng Zhongming, Huang Renlin, and others. The ship set sail at 8:45 AM, with a 19-gun salute. It is expected to reach Xunyang on the night of the 10th and will meet with Chiang and Huang on the afternoon of the 11th. A detailed discussion regarding the situation in North China will take place after meeting with Chiang and Huang. At this time, I have no particular opinions to express. However, in simple terms, maintaining sovereignty should be the unchangeable position. I will stay in Jiangxi for about two days, and the return to Nanjing is expected before the 15th. It is uncertain whether Huang Fu will come along. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang was originally scheduled to take the Zhongshan warship to Jiangxi on the evening of the 9th, but it was temporarily cancelled due to urgent matters. The departure was changed to the morning of the 10th. After receiving the order, the Zhongshan warship immediately prepared for departure. On the morning of the 10th, dark clouds gathered, and there was a light drizzle. At 8:00 AM, Chen Shaokuan braved the rain to inspect the warship. He also telegraphed the Wang residence to inquire about the departure time. Because Wang was eager to go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Huang Fu, he left the official residence of the Ministry of Railways by car for the naval dock at 8:20 AM, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming and four staff members. Prior to this, the naval department sent a band and a platoon of guards to line both sides of the dock to welcome him. Huang Renlin of the Lishi Society also arrived to assist. After Wang arrived at the dock, he boarded the ship with Chen Shaokuan, Huang Renlin, and others amid the melodious sound of military music. Soon after, the ship set sail, and a 19-gun salute was fired as a sign of respect. It sailed west at 8:40 AM. Wang told the Central News Agency reporter on the ship: I was invited by Chairman Chiang, and was originally scheduled to fly to Jiangxi yesterday morning, but the flight was cancelled due to rain. I intended to go by warship that evening, but it was unsuccessful due to official business. I am only leaving Nanjing this morning. I will stay in Jiangxi for two or three days and then return to Nanjing. This trip is to discuss political and diplomatic issues in North China with Chiang and Huang, and also to discuss central government affairs. As for the details, I will inform you after returning to Nanjing. The rumors that Huang Fu has resigned are absolutely untrue. Chen Shaokuan said that the Zhongshan warship is expected to arrive in Xunyang at around 8:00 AM on the 11th. President Wang and others will then take a special train on the Nanxun Railway to Nanchang, arriving at around 2:00 PM. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Huang and Fu Meet in Suiyuan; Zhao Chengzhou Arrives in Suiyuan with Fu; Wang Jingguo Handles Post-Disaster Affairs in Linh</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong, Fu Zuoyi, and Zhao Chengzhou arrived in Suiyuan from Chiba separately on the evening of the 9th to meet. It is undecided when Huang will go to Ningxia. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of the Interior, arrived in Guihua from Datong at 3:00 PM on the 9th and stayed at the Public Hospital. Suiyuan city hung flags to welcome him. Fu hosted a banquet for Huang at the Suiyuan Hotel in the evening, attended by Zhao Chengzhou and various department heads. Huang told the Central News Agency reporter that he would stay in Suiyuan briefly and then inspect western Suiyuan or go to Ningxia. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong left Beiping on the 8th with Secretary Shi Chushen and headed north. He did not stop at Datong. He arrived in Suiyuan at 3:50 PM on the 9th. Zhang Fu, commander of the 4th Cavalry Brigade, accompanied him. More than 100 people, including Feng Jing, Yuan Qing, and Zeng Taojun, welcomed him at the station. At 4:00 PM, Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengzhou returned to Suiyuan from Baotou. Huang got off the train and went to the West Station with Feng, Yuan, and others to welcome Fu and Zhao. Huang praised Fu and others for their speed and efficiency in resolving the Sun Bu issue. Huang said that he had a pleasant conversation with Yan in Shanxi but did not see Sun. There are no specific items on this inspection trip. He plans to go to Baotou within a few days. As for going to Ningxia, it will depend on whether the roads are passable. Fu issued a written statement saying that he returned to Suiyuan because the Sun Bu issue was largely resolved, and provincial affairs urgently need to be handled. Furthermore, Yang Hou and other small bandits are harassing the Mongolian border. He and Zhao are planning to thoroughly eliminate them. Sun Bu surrendered more than 3,200 firearms, more than 100 artillery pieces and machine guns, and a large amount of ammunition. They are currently stored in the Sansheng Temple and will be transported to the military branch. The disbanded officers and soldiers have successively arrived in Baotou and will be transported to Beiping and then sent back to their hometowns. Lu, Liu, and Yu's three brigades are currently stationed in Wulin. After they are reorganized, they will be transferred to Hebei, and the garrison location will be determined by the military branch. When Sun Bu advanced westward, he requisitioned a large number of camels and mules from various counties in Suiyuan. They have now been recovered and will be returned to the counties so as not to delay spring plowing. Wang Jingguo is still in Linhe, presiding over post-disaster affairs. After everything is settled, he will return east. Zhao said that he returned to Suiyuan this time to discuss the suppression of Yang's bandits with Fu and others with the greatest determination. Currently, Wang Ying is in Tianjin, colluding with the front lines, causing Yang's bandits to lead their men to eastern Chahar to surrender to the puppet organization. Yan Xishan has already telegraphed them to thoroughly eliminate them and vowed to eliminate this kind of bandits in the shortest possible time. The Shanxi-Suiyuan army will be demobilized on the 15th. That evening, Fu hosted a banquet for Huang and Zhao at the Suiyuan Hotel. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, the remnants of Sun's army in the Shifan area have been completely taken in by Wang Jingguo. The troops of Lu Cunhua and Zhao Guozeng and others in the vicinity of Ningyuan and the Hexi area, in addition to a part supplementing Hu Zongnan's division, have all been incorporated by Ma Hongkui. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Men Bingyue changed his departure date to Baotou to the 10th. According to him, this trip is to handle the demobilization of Sun's army. The demobilization fee of 230,000 yuan has been fully remitted to Suiyuan. The first train of unarmed soldiers to be discharged will arrive in Beiping on the 11th. Yang Hou and other small bandits have fled to the Mongolian border, and the Suiyuan authorities have decided to send Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry to pursue and suppress them. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Renyuan, a staff officer of the branch, has arrived in Suiyuan. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Executive Yuan; Reappointment of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund; Approval of Gu Renfa's Resignation from All Posts; Household Registration Law to be Implemented on July 1st</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 155th meeting on the morning of the 10th, attended by Kong Xiangxi, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shuren, Luo Wengan, Gu Mengyu, and others. Kong Xiangxi presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>(A) Review of Reports (I) Minister of Finance Kong and Minister of Justice Luo reported that they had been instructed to review the draft "Regulations on Punishing Acts that Hinder the Fundamental Monetary System." After review, it was believed that the punishment for hindering the silver standard currency should be added to the Criminal Law. Before the Criminal Law is amended and implemented, for the sake of practical needs, it is proposed to add the words "Provisional" to the title of the regulations, and its implementation period will be limited to two years. A proposed principle and revised draft were submitted for public resolution. The motion was passed and sent to the Central Political Council. (II) Minister of Interior Huang, Minister of Finance Kong, Minister of Transportation Zhu, Minister of Railways Gu, and Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Kong reported on the submitted cases concerning the funds for the Yellow River rehabilitation project. After review, four methods were decided: A. The Hebei Provincial Government's request to handle the surcharge on Tianjin Customs duties is proposed to be changed to a surcharge on Changlu salt tax according to the opinions of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee. B. Regarding the opinions on the fundraising methods proposed by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, 1. Regarding the issue of designated guarantees for loans from the three provinces, the Hebei Provincial Government's request to extend the additional tax on reed salt for two years is proposed to be decided quickly. An order should be telegraphed to the provincial government to quickly raise cash, and a report should be made to the Central Political Council. In addition, according to the report of the representative of the Ministry of Finance, the Henan Provincial Government intends to use the original salt tax surcharge as collateral to borrow cash from the bank, and the Ministry of Finance has agreed. The Shandong Provincial Government admits that it will raise funds for the project on its own. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to quickly negotiate a loan, and instruct the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee to give detailed instructions on the projects that Shandong Province should handle, and supervise the Shandong Provincial river engineering agencies to be responsible for the handling. 2. Regarding the issue of allocating US cotton and wheat loans, only the Yellow River rehabilitation project is of utmost importance and has special circumstances that are different from other water conservancy projects. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan send a letter to the National Economic Council to find special ways to raise funds. If the loan has already been allocated, please transfer it to alleviate the emergency. C. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee's request to first allocate 1 million yuan for the most dangerous projects. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan telegraph the committee to inquire about the most dangerous projects, how many locations there are, in which provinces they are located, and which provinces should originally be responsible. At the same time, order the Ministry of Finance to jointly with the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to first find a way to raise funds, and return them as soon as the loans from the three provinces are received. D. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee's request to include 1 million yuan for the committee's operating expenses in the budget for the 23rd year is proposed to be handed over to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. Resolution: Approved according to the review decision. (III) Minister of Transportation Zhu reported that he had been instructed to organize the land tax, first implement land reporting, and reduce the land tax surcharge. Together with the review records of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance, as well as the supplementary measures and the opinions proposed by Jiahua after review, it was submitted to the meeting. It was found that the original review opinion on the case of reducing the land tax surcharge was that the Executive Yuan could directly order it to be followed and implemented without collecting opinions from local governments together with the case of organizing the land tax and first implementing land reporting. The opinion is very correct. The general outline and supplementary measures for organizing the land tax and first implementing the land reporting methods are also very thorough. The original outline and supplementary measures were re-edited, combined into one, and a revised general outline of 22 articles for organizing the land tax and first implementing the land reporting methods, with detailed explanations attached to each article, was proposed for public resolution. Resolution: Approved according to the review opinion and handed over to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance for reference.</p>
<p>(B) Resolutions on Appointments and Removals (I) Resolved: The terms of office of Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Yangfu, Yan Deqing, Bu Long, and Jing En, directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Management Committee, have expired and should be reappointed. And Zhu Jiahua is still designated as the chairman. (II) Resolved: The request of Gu Renfa, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, to resign from all posts concurrently should be approved. Chen Guofu is temporarily acting as the director of the vacant department.

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 155th meeting on the morning of the 10th, attended by Kong Xiangxi, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shuren, Luo Wengan, Gu Mengyu, etc. The meeting was presided over by Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<p>(A) Examination and Report Items (1) Minister of Finance Kong and Minister of Judicial Administration Luo reported that they had been instructed to examine the draft regulations on punishing acts that impede the fundamental monetary system. After examination, it was deemed that the punishment for impeding the silver standard currency should be added to the Criminal Law. Before the Criminal Law is amended and implemented, for practical needs, it is proposed to add the word "Provisional" to the title of the regulations, and the implementation period should be limited to two years. A principle and revised draft were submitted for public resolution. The motion was passed and sent to the Central Political Council. (2) Minister of Interior Huang, Minister of Finance Kong, Minister of Transportation Zhu, Minister of Railways Gu, and Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Kong reported that they had been instructed to examine various cases concerning the funds for the Yellow River rehabilitation project. After examination, four methods were decided: A. The Hebei Provincial Government's request to handle the surcharge on Tianjin Customs duties is proposed to be changed to a surcharge on Changlu salt tax according to the opinions of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee. B. Regarding the opinions on the fundraising methods proposed by the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, 1. Regarding the issue of designated guarantees for loans from the three provinces, the Hebei Provincial Government's request to extend the additional tax on reed salt for two years is proposed to be decided quickly. An order should be telegraphed to the provincial government to quickly raise cash, and a report should be made to the Central Political Council. In addition, according to the report of the representative of the Ministry of Finance, the Henan Provincial Government intends to use the original salt tax surcharge as collateral to borrow cash from the bank, and the Ministry of Finance has agreed. The Shandong Provincial Government admits that it will raise funds for the project on its own. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to quickly negotiate a loan, and instruct the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee to give detailed instructions on the projects that Shandong Province should handle, and supervise the Shandong Provincial river engineering agencies to be responsible for the handling. 2. Regarding the issue of allocating US cotton and wheat loans, only the Yellow River rehabilitation project is of utmost importance and has special circumstances that are different from other water conservancy projects. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan send a letter to the National Economic Council to find special ways to raise funds. If the loan has already been allocated, please transfer it to alleviate the emergency. C. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee's request to first allocate 1 million yuan for the most dangerous projects. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan telegraph the committee to inquire about the most dangerous projects, how many locations there are, in which provinces they are located, and which provinces should originally be responsible. At the same time, order the Ministry of Finance to jointly with the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to first find a way to raise funds, and return them as soon as the loans from the three provinces are received. D. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee's request to include 1 million yuan for the committee's operating expenses in the budget for the 23rd year is proposed to be handed over to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. Resolution: Approved according to the review decision. (3) Minister of Transportation Zhu reported that he had been instructed to organize the land tax, first implement land reporting, and reduce the land tax surcharge. Together with the review records of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance, as well as the supplementary measures and the opinions proposed by Jiahua after review, it was submitted to the meeting. It was found that the original review opinion on the case of reducing the land tax surcharge was that the Executive Yuan could directly order it to be followed and implemented without collecting opinions from local governments together with the case of organizing the land tax and first implementing land reporting. The opinion is very correct. The general outline and supplementary measures for organizing the land tax and first implementing the land reporting methods are also very thorough. The original outline and supplementary measures were re-edited, combined into one, and a revised general outline of 22 articles for organizing the land tax and first implementing the land reporting methods, with detailed explanations attached to each article, was proposed for public resolution. Resolution: Approved according to the review opinion and handed over to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance for reference.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese diplomatic authorities have publicly stated their opposition to economic cooperation between the great powers and China.

<h3>Progress of the Suppression of Bandits Army in Sichuan; Bandits Retreat to Tongjiang</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) The bandit forces are currently retreating to Tongjiang. The 5th Route Xu division has approached the Zhenlong Pass, a strategic stronghold in Tongjiang. The entire Fan division has reached the left bank of Tongjiang, pressing towards various strategic points in the Jitan area. The 3rd Route Army advanced to the south of Sanjiangkou on the 8th, and a part of the army attacked Longchengzhai and Zhunan Zhai. The entire front line is actively advancing towards Tongjiang, joining forces with the 5th Route to attack together. The front line in Tongjiang is full of high mountains and cliffs. The government army has decided to use mountain artillery to bombard it, in order to facilitate the assault. The bandits are now in a very panicked state, confined to a corner of Tongjiang, and are hurriedly building fortifications, attempting to defend to the death. However, Xu Xiangqian's illness is very serious, and the morale of the army is disintegrating. Judging from the fighting power of the 5th Route Army and the 3rd Route Li Luo's various units in breaking through dozens of strategic points between Tong and Ba in recent days, it is expected that there will be amazing progress within a few days. If the bandits fail in their final desperate struggle, they will flee to Shaanxi and Hubei. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) More than 120 mass graves have been found in Zhaohua, with countless skeletons, totaling about 20,000 people. The situation is too horrible to bear. The front lines where the government and bandit forces have fought fiercely in recent days are all steep cliffs. The government army is advancing step by step, making the bandits unable to resist. Therefore, the casualties of the bandit army are extremely high. The total number of government army deaths and injuries is about 1,100. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) After the 1st Route Deng's troops captured Nanjiang, the third phase of the mission was completed. It is reported that Deng Xihou will return to the province within a few days to report.

<h3>Cracks in the American Blue Eagle Movement</h3>
<p>The labor unrest in America is currently showing a tendency to spread across various regions, rising and falling incessantly. Whether it be the coal miners in Pennsylvania and Illinois, the automobile factory workers in Detroit, or the silk industry workers in Indianapolis, all have been in constant and fierce conflict with their employers due to demands for higher wages and reduced working hours. On the 6th of this month, six thousand unemployed workers rallied and marched in front of the Minneapolis City Hall, shouting slogans like "We want bread and work," even clashing with the police for several hours. This shows that the brewing labor unrest has become more blatant than the large-scale strike rumors of the steel, automobile, and textile industries in late last month. Such labor unrest has indeed diminished the luster of the Blue Eagle Movement, which was personally promoted by Roosevelt. Some say that Roosevelt's government's major policies may undergo a drastic change because of this, and its impact on the future of the American and global economies cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>We still remember that when Roosevelt came to power in March of last year, the American financial organization experienced unprecedented panic, thus creating an opportunity for Roosevelt to use dictatorial means. First, he rejected the separatism of the banking system, and then he corrected the laissez-faire habits of industrial and commercial organizations. The reason why he could become the central figure praised by the people was due to the circumstances. When Roosevelt was engaged in the Washington Talks and participated in the London World Economic Conference, his eyes were full of hope, all wanting to achieve the goal of smoothly overcoming the global economic crisis through cooperation. The reason why he could implicitly become the king of the capitalist world was also due to the circumstances. In addition to wielding dictatorship to adapt to domestic and international crises, Roosevelt also felt the need to increase the general purchasing power of society, so he also advocated raising wages and reducing working hours, as if to say that the profit of capital depends on the development of production, the development of production depends on the expansion of the market, and if the market is to be expanded, it will not be successful without increasing the total amount of social income. This is why employers must generously pay the working masses with higher wages. All of this is enough to illustrate that Roosevelt's fundamental plan is only to achieve the goal of accumulating profits by raising wages. However, by doing what he does to get what he wants, workers are bound to resent not getting real benefits, and employers will resist because of their losses, because the current sacrifices, however small, are real benefits, while the future benefits, however large, are still far off and uncertain. Looking at the Roosevelt government's performance in the past year, policies are as numerous as hairs, but their effectiveness is not obvious. The chess game is undecided, only to cause confusion. To this day, not only is it still unable to satisfy the expectations of general capitalists, but also the demands of laborers cannot be met. This is the origin of the surging labor unrest.</p>
<p>However, is the current labor unrest spreading across the country enough to make Roosevelt abandon the policies he has embraced for years? This is still a huge question. According to our observation, Roosevelt is not only unwilling to abandon his existing position, but may even feel the need for dictatorship more strongly. The surging labor unrest will hinder the military-industrial production organization of today and will further impoverish capital profits. In order to implement his policies, Roosevelt will only have to further centralize and monopolize American financial capital before he can talk about maintaining the security of American industry and ensuring profits. From this point of view, is the outbreak of today's labor unrest enough to stop Roosevelt's determination to develop his policies?</p>

(10th Dispatch) (Fuzhou) The remnants of the pseudo-135th Army Corps on the Fujian-Jiangxi border have suffered heavy losses after being repeatedly besieged by our army from different directions in recent days. Our army is still searching and suppressing them. The remnants in TaiNing and JiangLe will soon be cleared. According to those who escaped from the bandit areas, due to our army's large-scale encirclement and suppression, they knew it was difficult to escape, so they have scrambled to change the numbers of the bandit army units. There is one division with less than one hundred people, and there is one company with more than one division. Such measures are taken to avoid our army's attention and to try their luck in the off chance of survival. There are also wireless radio stations built in the bandit areas, which often secretly communicate with various reactionary parties. There are very few intellectuals in the bandit areas, and many of those captured are forced to work as secretaries and clerks, but the treatment is extremely cruel. If they do not comply with the bandit's wishes or have minor faults, they are repeatedly whipped and beaten. Captured women, regardless of their appearance, are forced into sexual relations by the bandit leaders. Those who refuse are stripped of their clothes, tied naked to the beams, and tortured for pleasure, with the women's husbands, fathers, and brothers forced to watch. The misery is beyond description, like entering a living hell. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Guangzhou-Hankou Railway Project Decided to be Shortened by One Year</h3>

<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Determined to Resist Japan; Longing for News from Inside the Pass and Prepared to Kill the Enemy; Li Du's Former Troops Pretend to Surrender to Earn Weapons and Ammunition</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Due to special circumstances in the three northeastern provinces, it has long been common for the people to possess weapons for self-defense. After the September 18th Incident, volunteer armies rose like a storm, with a particularly strong appeal. The anti-Japanese heroes Li Du, Ma Zhanshan, and others were able to fight the enemy with isolated forces because of this. After Li and Ma entered the pass, the Northeast Volunteer Army in eastern Jilin still flew the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag [Nationalist flag], confronting the Japanese puppets. Others scattered among the people, waiting for the opportunity to rise again, or pretended to surrender to the puppet state, taking the opportunity to defraud military supplies and ammunition to replenish their strength, acting according to circumstances, all longing for news from inside the pass to prepare to kill the enemy. In order to eliminate the resistance, Japan ordered the puppet Manchukuo to collect civilian guns. The volunteer army, feeling that it was difficult to hide and fearing that it would be difficult to raise an army in the future, all rose up again. The people in the Fushun and Hulin areas of eastern Jilin also entered the mountains with guns. The pseudo-army in Yilan revolted, and sometimes Japanese women participated in anti-Manchukuo work (originally former troops of Li Du). The people in the Shuangcheng and Fuyu areas of western Jilin also successively launched uprisings. More than a thousand people in Fuyu even killed Deng, the company commander of the pseudo-army, and several Japanese instructors. It can be seen that the people of the eastern provinces are constantly confronting the Japanese puppet army. (China United Press Communication)</p>
<p>(Jilin) Zhou Taiping, the leader of the eastern Jilin Volunteer Army and former subordinate of Li Du, led hundreds of troops along the Dunhua-Tumen railway line. Acting swiftly, the puppet army was exhausted in responding. They sent people to persuade him to surrender, promising to replenish ammunition and incorporate him into a formal army. After several rounds of persuasion, Zhou Taiping finally nodded in agreement. Ji Xing, the commander of the pseudo-Jilin Provincial Garrison, then ordered the unit to be stationed at Wogua Station north of Jiaohe County, awaiting organization, and first replenished ammunition and clothing and issued rewards. Who knew that Taiping's surrender was aimed at ammunition and was not sincere? After the goal was achieved, he led his troops to revolt at 8 PM on the 10th of last month (February), and kidnapped the chairman of the Jiaohe County Chamber of Commerce, Nakajima, the police instructor (Japanese), and 20 policemen, retreating to the mountains around Shuangmiaozi. The Japanese puppet army was furious when they received the news. Sato, the commander of the Japanese army, has led the Jilin pseudo-teaching team to pursue them.

<h3>Germany Increases Military Spending; Britain Intervenes with the League of Nations; France Also Expresses Unified Action; Germany Says It Does Not Violate the Treaty; Disarmament Steering Committee Reopens Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The British government officially inquired with Berlin about the significance of Germany's move to increase national defense spending, based on the League of Nations' continued authority to supervise Germany. Therefore, the British government can ask the League of Nations to pay attention to any actions that violate the treaty. Britain, France, and other countries have long suspected that Germany has violated the treaty on military equipment. Some sources now say that in view of Germany's new budget, what was done secretly in the past is now being done openly and brazenly. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's increase in national defense spending has caused shock among various countries. Today, an official on Wilhelm Street met with a Reuters interviewer and made a statement to dispel doubts, saying that the army's expenditure of 175 million marks was actually because the army had to be completely reorganized in accordance with the short-term military service system. The navy's expenditure of 50 million marks is intended to be used to gradually refresh old military equipment and old warships. The air force's expenditure of 13.2 million marks is intended to be used to implement public protection plans and reorganize civil aviation affairs, such as replacing single-engine aircraft with multi-engine aircraft and expanding aviation affairs. The increased expenditure does not violate the Treaty of Versailles, because the treaty does not have any binding provisions on military budget proposals.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon told the House of Commons today that he had ordered the British ambassador to Berlin to inquire with the German government about this matter. The diplomatic circles in Paris are also paying attention to this matter. It is said that the French government is eager to dispel this doubt but feels that it would be more effective for the British government to negotiate with Germany.</p>
<p>At the same time, the so-called speculation that Britain has a new plan for a disarmament convention is not believed by people in London. It is said that Britain has no new plan, but the British government has not expressed its unwillingness to consider new guarantees for the implementation of the convention. This guarantee is what France wants, namely, sanctions for those who violate the treaty. This kind of sanction is roughly financial and economic in nature.</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson has arrived in Geneva. Today, he issued a statement saying that the governments of various countries with whom he has consulted seem to unanimously advocate that there should be considerable guarantees. However, opinions differ significantly on the rigorous implementation of these guarantees. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) A certain senior official here claimed today that the former British Ambassador to France, Lord Tyrrell, met with French Foreign Minister Barthou on Saturday and told him that the British government intended to ask the German government to explain whether the increased military expenditure had violated the Treaty of Versailles or was prepared to violate the treaty. Barthou thanked Tyrrell for his report and earnestly requested him to convey to the British government that the French cabinet fully agreed with the British government's actions. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Steering Committee Reopened Meeting Yesterday; Henderson Calls for Facilitating the Convention; British Plan Should be Discussed Immediately</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At today's afternoon meeting of the Disarmament Conference Steering Committee, Chairman Henderson spoke, advocating for a slightly longer period of time so that efforts from all sides could lead to the conclusion of an agreement on certain key points. He believed that there was no better strategy than to extend the time limit. He also said that in 1932, even when war was spreading in the Far East, the Disarmament Conference opened with great hope. Unfortunately, this hopeful situation quietly passed, and trust turned into a new competition for armaments. But there is something to be desired, that is, although the military budgets of major countries have now begun to increase, the arms race has not yet been fully exerted. We cannot but admit that the changes in the past few months have made the progress of our work more difficult. He hoped that the participants would not abandon their great cause, because our solemn responsibility is to make the Disarmament Conference achieve a conclusion in accordance with treaty obligations and avoid a new arms race. British representative Eden then spoke, explaining the efforts of the British government to seek an agreement, stating the circumstances of his talks in Paris, Berlin, and Rome. Finally, he said that in addition to other difficulties, there was a fundamental difference between the views of France and Germany. He also said that he did not intend to hinder its progress when exchanging opinions, so he advocated convening a meeting of the Steering Committee on April 30 to discuss the results of the exchange of opinions and decide on the steps to be taken thereafter. Russian representative Stein spoke, advocating for convening a Disarmament Conference as soon as possible and stating the need for countries to conclude non-aggression pacts, adopt Soviet proposals, and determine the definition of aggressor countries. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, according to Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, the opinions of various countries on disarmament are not as complex as they used to be and are gradually tending to converge. Henderson's views can be seen in Henderson's review of disarmament negotiations after 1933, which is 32 pages long and will be released at the conference tonight. Tomorrow afternoon at 4:00, the Disarmament Steering Committee will hold a meeting. It is said that the Disarmament Steering Committee to be held tomorrow will decide to convene the Disarmament Conference to be held on May 23 as scheduled. Henderson said, "The differences of opinion among countries on security have gradually dissipated. To this day, all the countries concerned recognize that security must have adequate guarantees. I believe that if countries can negotiate with each other, they will be able to reach a clear provision on security and guarantees, and the importance of this provision will be proportional to the circumstances of violating the Disarmament Convention." US Secretary of State Hull telegraphed from Washington, saying that the United States will still take a non-participating attitude when the future Steering Committee and Disarmament Conference discuss purely European disarmament and politics. US Disarmament Representative Davis is still on vacation, but US Minister to Switzerland Wilson has received instructions from Washington and will be the US observer representative at the Disarmament Conference, but Wilson will not participate in any disarmament discussions. It is said that countries no longer want to propose any suggestions on guarantees and adjudications for punishing those who violate the Disarmament Convention. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Discusses French Note; Preparing to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden was dispatched to Geneva to participate in the Presidium Committee of the Disarmament Conference. After his departure, the Cabinet Disarmament Committee held a meeting to discuss the French oral note of April 6. According to this document, talks between London and Paris can continue. This is as we initially expected. However, the British Cabinet must wait until the guarantees for the implementation of the Disarmament Convention that France deems necessary have been clearly stipulated before it can consider the new stage of disarmament. However, responsible parties have repeatedly stated to avoid misunderstandings that the British government has always been loyal to the disarmament plan it proposed. It is also said that the issue of German rearmament currently being considered is only the first step in a general disarmament solution. In this regard, Britain has always believed that the British disarmament plan is superior to the Italian plan. Therefore, British personnel are still preparing to conduct negotiations to enrich the guarantees for the implementation of the Disarmament Convention. However, the quantity originally set by the British plan can only be modified within the scope of ensuring that the establishment of the Disarmament Convention can actually reduce armaments. Therefore, the general public formally denied the Daily Mail's claim that Britain will propose a new plan. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Disarmament Committee today discussed the French disarmament note, which is quite important. Although the contents of the note have not yet been announced, the outside world has glimpsed its outline, forcing the British government to deliberate at length. The question of whether Britain is willing to guarantee France's security as a condition for France's disarmament is particularly relevant. Some British newspapers believe that Britain's compromise disarmament solution will be based on French suggestions, with the British side limiting economic sanctions to be an obligation in the Disarmament Convention. The News Chronicle reported that if the United States intends to maintain peace in Europe, the United States should not object to accepting economic sanctions. The Daily Mail then said that Germany should express its views on this matter. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>France, Poland, and the Little Entente: French Foreign Minister Inquires About Polish Diplomacy; Lingering Disputes Between Poland and Czechoslovakia; Romania and Yugoslavia Share Unanimous Opinions</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Barthou received the French Ambassador to Poland, Laroche, inquiring about Poland's views on current international issues, as well as the non-aggression treaty recently signed between Germany and Poland. Barthou will travel to Poland later this month, hence this preliminary inquiry into Polish diplomatic affairs. The Foreign Minister then received the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, to discuss disarmament issues. The Ambassador reported extensively on the situation in Germany. It is noted that the British Cabinet, due to Germany's increased military spending, recently raised questions with Berlin, requesting a response to understand whether Germany has already violated the Treaty of Versailles in fact, or is preparing to violate it. The facts presented by the Ambassador to the Foreign Minister sufficiently prove that the British Cabinet's actions were not without reason. Additionally, British Ambassador to France, Tyrrell, informed the Foreign Minister on Saturday of the British government's proposals regarding Germany's rearmament. When François-Poncet met with the Foreign Minister, he also discussed the Saar issue. The League of Nations Administrative Council will convene on May 7 to discuss this matter, which Barthou intends to attend. If the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference decides to convene the General Commission on May 23, Barthou is prepared to travel to Geneva at that time. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>The French Foreign Minister Barthou will soon travel to Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, to visit political figures. Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister Beneš recently consulted with the French Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Noël, on the detailed itinerary of Barthou's visit. Beneš told the French Ambassador that the French Foreign Minister's trip is indeed one of the most important political events, which will occupy a decisive place in the history of all nations. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia is generally considered to have ended, but it is still a matter of concern for Polish public opinion. This dispute arose in December of last year, when former Polish veterans held a demonstration in Cieszyn, Silesia, a city on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The two countries had long disputed the city. After a ruling by the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague, a protocol was signed in 1925, dividing the city between the two countries. When Polish veterans held a demonstration there in February last year, it caused a stir in both Prague and Warsaw. Three Poles were arrested in Czechoslovakia, and Polish authorities expelled twenty-two Czech residents from Poland. Subsequently, the Czech court ruled to release the three arrested Poles, and therefore it was generally believed that the dispute between the two countries had ended. However, the Clock Newspaper, the official publication of the Polish government with conservative leanings, published a lengthy article today discussing the relationship between Poland and Czechoslovakia, stating that there is a lack of ethnic unity within Czechoslovakia, while Poland has only recovered two-thirds of its territories. The newspaper also stated that Poland's recent signing of non-aggression treaties with Soviet Russia and Germany is sufficient to eliminate the danger of revising Poland's borders. Poland previously shared foreign troubles with Czechoslovakia, but now Poland has nothing to fear. In conclusion, the newspaper expressed much doubt about the friendship between Poland and Czechoslovakia, concluding that the border issue between the two countries, in terms of justice and time, is favorable to Poland. (Havas, 10th) Yugoslavian Capital Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, en route to Geneva, arrived here at 2:00 PM today, holding a meeting with Foreign Minister Jevtić, and will depart for Geneva in the evening. The meeting between the two Foreign Ministers is of utmost importance, as Titulescu will represent the Little Entente countries in talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in Geneva, and will also meet with French Foreign Minister Barthou in Paris. After the meeting between the two, officials reiterated that Yugoslavia and Romania have completely identical views. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Prague Foreign Minister Beneš, the General Rapporteur of the Disarmament Conference, has departed for Geneva to attend the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference. Political figures here stated that Beneš will discuss with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in Geneva the issue of the Little Entente countries' de jure recognition of the Soviet Union. It is expected that this matter can be resolved soon, and the Czech government may send an ambassador to Russia by the end of this month. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Poor Domestic Situation in Germany: Seeking Understanding Abroad; Public Opinion Leans Towards Reconciliation with France; Rumors of Franco-German Negotiations in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) As French Foreign Minister Barthou is about to visit Warsaw, it is rumored that he will meet with German authorities when passing through Berlin. Although this was denied by Paris yesterday, Germans still believe that the French Foreign Minister will meet with German authorities, and the outstanding issues between France and Germany may be resolved in this meeting. The shift in German public opinion is evident here. Therefore, in recent days, the tone of the press towards France has been much more moderate than before, and some have said that France has made great concessions on disarmament, as France has recognized that the Disarmament Conference will convene on May 23. As for Germany's return to the Disarmament Conference, it is no longer insistent, and the German side has also slightly revealed this intention. In short, one thing we can be sure of is that the domestic situation in Germany is not good, such as the budget deficit, the stagnation of foreign trade, the crisis of the central bank, and the difficulties of the social situation, all of which are undeniable facts. Although the authorities sometimes make triumphant propaganda, it is not enough to convince people, and even the German people do not fully believe it, and their doubts about the government's effectiveness are quite considerable. With these domestic worries, the German authorities cannot but seek understanding abroad, and especially must seek reconciliation with France. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Accession to the League of Nations: Still Some Obstacles; Switzerland Refuses to Recognize Soviet Russia; Requires Diplomatic Remediation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations hope that Soviet Russia will join the League of Nations when the League holds its general assembly in September. This issue will be discussed soon when Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov comes to Geneva for disarmament negotiations. However, there are currently several issues that may hinder Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations: ㈠ Some member states find it difficult to agree to certain conditions put forward by Soviet Russia; ㈡ Switzerland's refusal to recognize Soviet Russia is also a reason, as the League of Nations enjoys certain guarantees from the Swiss government, so this obstacle is quite important, but this situation can be remedied through diplomatic means. In recent days, the focus of all parties will shift to another issue, which is to cooperate to reopen the Disarmament Conference. Tomorrow, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson will state the necessity of immediately intensifying work at the Disarmament Conference core group meeting. British Minister Eden went to Geneva today and seemed quite happy upon his departure. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Hungary and Russia Resume Diplomatic Relations: Russian Ambassador Presents Credentials to Hungary</h3>
<p>Budapest On February 6th of this year, the Hungarian Minister to Turkey, Junger, and the Soviet Ambassador to Italy, Potemkin, exchanged documents in Rome, formally recognizing the Soviet Union, and diplomatic and economic relations between the two countries were restored. Hungary sent Junger to temporarily reside in Moscow, and the Soviet government has also sent its Minister to Austria, Batenovosky, to concurrently serve as Minister to Hungary, with the embassy still located in Vienna. Today, Batenovosky met with Regent Horthy to present his credentials. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Actively Prepares Military Against Japan: Six Ships Fully Loaded with Military Supplies Sail from the Black Sea to Vladivostok</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to strengthen its military equipment in the Far East, the Soviet Russian government is currently constructing defense works along the border with Manchuria. In addition to the twelve submarines stationed on Soviet-controlled islands outside Vladivostok Bay, there are also countless fortifications near the Korean border, and large airfields are being built, using Japan's aggression as an excuse to vigorously carry out military preparations against Japan. A telegram received today from a certain place stated that recently the Soviet Russian government hired three ships from Britain, two ships from Greece (each 6,000 tons), and one domestic ship (tonnage unknown), for a total of six steamships, scheduled to depart from the Port of Odessa (Black Sea) and arrive near Vladivostok. It is reported that there are also several foreign ships waiting to transport munitions in the same port in the Black Sea. This matter has been discovered by the Japanese authorities, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army and Navy will take measures to seriously monitor the above situation. (Jiji, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia War Machine Is Not Mature; Before Japan Concludes a Treaty with the United States, It Will Definitely Not Lightly Launch an Offensive Against Russia—Observation by American Mr. Funn—</h3>
<p>(New York) Mr. Funn, who once served as the Far East Manager of the Associated Press, recently published an article in the American Miners' Magazine, stating that Russia and Japan may not be willing to meet on the battlefield. The reasons he cited are divided into five categories. Mr. Funn's paper said that Japan's economic and political ambitions in the Far East indicate that the day of war between Russia and Japan is still far away. And both countries are unwilling to be the first to draw swords. The reasons are as follows: First, the Japanese army has been able to control all of Manchuria; Second, the attitude of the United States; Third, the warlike nature of the Japanese people; Fourth, the war machines of Russia and Japan are not yet mature. He also traced Japan's political and economic conspiracies in Manchukuo after the September 18 Incident in 1931. Japan used the excuse that Chinese people threw bombs on the main line of the South Manchuria Railway on the night of September 18, and then freely began military action to create today's Manchukuo. In his conclusion, Mr. Funn stated that if Soviet Russia attacks Japan, (which no one in the East believes,) then the Soviet Russian leaders must have a full understanding of the burden of war. If Japan attacks Soviet Russia, (a few experienced observers in the East believe that Japan may take this action,) the Japanese leaders must be confident that they can consolidate the power of the Japanese in Manchuria, and also conclude a treaty with the United States, so that Japan's raw materials will be guaranteed to continue. Otherwise, Japan will never launch an offensive against Soviet Russia first. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Frequent Disputes on the Chinese Eastern Railway: Transporting Medicines to Russia Considered Illegal; Four Chinese and Russian Employees Detained</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Today, several Chinese and Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway were arrested for secretly transporting goods to Russia, causing a great shock. It turns out that Li, the chief medical officer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Volkov, the chief physician of the Chinese Eastern Railway Hospital, and Galmikov, the director of the hospital's pharmaceutical department, transported a batch of medicines to Russia, and 7,000 rolls of bandages to the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The "Manchu" authorities considered this illegal private transportation and arrested them. In addition, Galomov, the chief inspector of the eighth district of Harbin, was also arrested because eighteen freight cars loaded with suspicious goods recently heading to the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway were missing, presumably having entered Russian territory.

<h3>Labor Unrest in the United States: Auto Workers End Strike; Johnson Meets with Roosevelt; Recovery Administration to Adopt Decentralized System</h3>
<p>The auto industry labor unrest in Detroit is becoming increasingly serious. Currently, all small factories that manufacture essential parts for auto assembly have decided to strike. The "Automobile Products Company" is among them. More than a hundred auto factories have had to stop working due to the lack of necessary parts. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>5,600 workers manufacturing auto parts in Detroit previously went on strike demanding wage increases. The employers have now agreed to increase wages by 10%, so the strike has ended. In addition, 18,000 workers at the engine manufacturing company, who were laid off due to the parts workers' strike, can now resume work. However, another 18,000 workers who do not belong to the labor union are still continuing to demand a 20% wage increase, but the employers believe that they cannot accept this, so the situation is very tense. There are even rumors that General Johnson, the director of the Economic Recovery Administration, will resign. Although this statement has been denied, General Johnson will submit a plan to President Roosevelt, advocating for the revision of the Economic Recovery Plan, from centralized decision-making back to decentralization, which is indeed the case. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington National Recovery Administration Director Johnson suddenly went to Florida today with an assistant to meet President Roosevelt on a yacht. This matter is quite important. It is believed that Johnson will discuss with President Roosevelt new ways to quickly end the labor unrest. McGrath, the labor advisor of the Recovery Administration, is in Detroit, discussing everything with the leaders of the workers of the Motor Products Society and the Airplane Parts Company, who have been on strike since April 6. It is expected that Recovery Administration Director Johnson will order McGrath to investigate the shutdown of the Hudson Motor Company nearby. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington The National Recovery Administration, which was originally solely responsible by Director Johnson, will now be divided into departments to handle affairs and share responsibilities. The Recovery Administration has 400 industry codes and 3,000 employees. Johnson feels that it is necessary for him to only handle the most important events, so he plans to establish a general affairs department, with Mr. Lin Zhi signing industry codes and other documents.

<h3>International Train Derails Near Linz, Austria: 19 Killed and Injured; Rail Spikes Removed; Suspected Political Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Vienna The special express train from Vienna to Paris, which departed from Vienna at 11:00 PM last night, derailed between the Horsching and Marchtrenk stations near Linz at 2:30 AM this morning. As a result, two people were killed, five were seriously injured, and twelve were slightly injured. When the train had not yet passed the accident site, a 25-meter-long section of rail had been removed of its spikes and placed diagonally on the side. When the train arrived, it was traveling at high speed, and the locomotive and the first two passenger cars completely overturned, and all other cars also derailed, with only three remaining on the tracks. Most of the victims were railway employees, with only two passengers injured. After investigation, at least seven people would be required to remove the spikes from this section of rail, indicating that this accident must be a conspiracy. However, it is still difficult to understand whether it is a political conspiracy. Linz is the city where the Socialist Party and the Nationalist Party have recently had disturbances, and the location of the train accident has had two previous accidents in 1932 and 1933, both caused by dismissed railway workers. From this, clues can be found. The Railway Administration has offered a reward of 5,000 schillings (Austrian currency) to apprehend the perpetrators. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Ireland Dies Suddenly at Banquet: Due to Sudden Heart Attack; South Ireland Opposes Land Annuity Issue Being Submitted to Arbitration; Resumption of Negotiations Between Britain and Ireland Remains Distant</h3>
<p>Dublin The new US Minister to Southern Ireland, McDowell, suddenly fainted at a banquet tonight and passed away. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Dublin Tonight, Southern Ireland's Chairman of the Executive Council, de Valera, hosted a banquet at Dublin Castle in his personal capacity for members of the Executive Council and the diplomatic corps. The new US Minister McDowell happened to be sitting next to de Valera. After speeches were given by everyone, the US Minister rose to respond, but his speech was very unclear. He then suddenly fainted in his seat and passed away moments later. It is said that it was due to a sudden heart attack. The US Minister was the manager of several American mines and had served as the Governor of Montana. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Today in the House of Commons, regarding the dispute between Britain and Ireland, Dominions Secretary Thomas stated that Britain is very willing to resume discussions with the Free State in order to resolve various issues, but the issues must first be recognized as a basis for discussion. The South Ireland land annuity issue is only part of the dispute. The British government has agreed to submit this issue to arbitration, but the Free State does not accept it. Labour MP Grenfell stated that the Southern Ireland Executive Council Chairman and the British Dominions Secretary should find a way to negotiate to resolve the difficulties regarding the arbitration proposal. Thomas replied that he is prepared to meet at any time, but Southern Ireland's de Valera has not yet expressed a willingness to reopen negotiations. Treasury Secretary Betterton stated that Britain collected a total of £2.5 million in special taxes on South Ireland's imports in the past year. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Water Shortage Panic in Britain: Government to Take Emergency Measures; Private Water Storage to Be Used for Public Use</h3>
<p>London Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons today that there is a severe shortage of water nationwide and that the government has now decided to take emergency measures to provide relief. Minister of Health Young will introduce a bill tomorrow, the full text of which will be released tonight and will be given a second reading on Thursday. Thames Conservancy Chairman Desborough stated that if this summer is as dry as last year, the water issue will be extremely serious. The amount of water that can be released from Teddington is not 1,400,000,000 gallons, but only 600,000,000 gallons, so the country must have one-third of an inch of rain every three nights to be sufficient for use. The bill to be introduced by the Minister of Health tomorrow will be like an emergency act and will be processed quickly.

<h3>To Visit North China for Investigation - Large Squadron of Japanese Aircraft Arrives at Malanyu - Negotiations for the Reception of Malanyu Also Halted</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in Beiping, Japanese troops along the Great Wall line have been actively operating again since the 1st of this month. The number of Japanese troops in Saho Bridge and Malanyu within the Xifengkou area has not decreased. Outside Malanyu Town, 29 Japanese aircraft from Shenyang and Changchun flew in on the 4th and 5th of this month, flying low along the Great Wall line every day, causing extreme panic among local residents. Recently, over a hundred retired Japanese officers have been sent to Beiping in succession, residing in the Japanese Embassy. Their mission is to be dispatched to various provinces, including Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shandong, under the guise of traveling, to scout out local conditions. They all carry special missions, which is highly noteworthy. In recent days, Japanese troops in the war zone and at various passes along the Great Wall have also been traveling frequently, appearing quite active. At the same time, the Japanese garrison in Tianjin has also notified our side that they intend to conduct military exercises in the war zone soon, but the date, number of troops, and route have not been specified. Our side will assess the situation before responding. 町尻量基, a military attaché to the Japanese Emperor, was dispatched to China to comfort the troops stationed in North China. He arrived in Beiping from Tianjin a few days ago. At 8:00 AM on the 6th, accompanied by Kikuchi, Chief of Staff of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, 松尾, a staff officer, and 柴山兼四郎, a military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, they departed from Beiping in four cars to visit the Yongjian unit stationed in Gubeikou and inspect the battleground around Nantianmen. They arrived in Gubeikou at 3:00 PM that day. After inspecting the troops, they spent the night at the Yongjian headquarters in Hexi. They left Gubeikou yesterday afternoon and arrived in Beiping at 5:00 PM. 町尻菊池 is scheduled to return to Tianjin by train on the Beining Railway at 8:25 AM this morning (8th) and then travel to Tianjin East for inspection. 柴山 is scheduled to take the train on the Pinghan Railway to Shijiazhuang at 9:00 AM this morning and then travel to Shanxi. Although the Japanese side claims that their mission is to travel, according to investigations, their purpose in going to Shanxi is to investigate the transportation conditions in Shanxi under the instructions of the Japanese Army Ministry, with a particular focus on the development of the Datong-Puzhou Railway. 柴山 is scheduled to stay in Shanxi for a week and then travel to Datong before returning to Beiping via the PingSui Railway. According to sources familiar with the matter, negotiations between Yin Rugeng, the Jiji Administrative Inspector of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, and 柴山兼四郎, the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, regarding the handover of Malanyu were underway. Because the Japanese army’s Kamamiya unit with one company of more than 120 troops is stationed in the area, and the Wang Jiren unit of the pseudo-police force is stationed in Dongling, they must both be withdrawn to the north of the Great Wall so that our security forces can take over the defense. 柴山 cabled the Kwantung Army headquarters in Changchun to request instructions. The reply telegram arrived in Beiping yesterday, temporarily postponing the handover of Malanyu. The Japanese Embassy has already notified our authorities. It is rumored that the Japanese side's reason seems to be that the chairman of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, Huang Fu, has now left Beiping, and everything will be discussed after Huang returns to Beiping. Therefore, the content is extremely simple. Our side is determined to continue negotiations and has telegraphed Huang to report the standstill and request instructions. Therefore, the issue of receiving Malanyu can only progress after Huang returns to Beiping. (8th)</p>
<h3>Northern Route Army Captures Zhaoxie - Now Approaching Ningdu -</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that Zhaoxie is located in the southern part of Lean, and is one of the most important bandit strongholds alongside Tengtian in Yongfeng, and Dongpo and Huangpo in Yihuang, no less important than Longgang and Futian. Moreover, Zhaoxie is the throat controlling access from Nanfeng, Yihuang, Lean, and Yongfeng to Ningdu, and is critical to the military operations against the bandits. In 1931, during the joint suppression campaign by the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, Sun Lianzhong was in charge of the central route and attacked Ningdu head-on from here, suffering great sacrifices before recovering it. Later, due to the betrayal of Dong Zhentang and Ji Zhentong, it was occupied by the bandits again, and has never seen the light of day since. This time, a certain unit of the Northern Route Army attacked and advanced from the south of Lean, defeating the pseudo-model division and the pseudo-guard division, and recovered Zhaoxie on the 5th. The remnants of the bandits fled southeast towards the mountainous areas bordering Ningdu, Guangchang, and Nanfeng. The unit is still pursuing them, and can connect with the national forces at Huangpo in Yihuang and Qia Village in Nanfeng in the east, and coordinate with the national forces that have crossed Shaxi in the west. From here, they can move south to approach Ningdu, and attack the important bandit strongholds of Dajinzhu, Dongshao, Luokou, and Wangpo. The national forces have learned from past mistakes, and this time, they will stabilize each place they recover before gradually advancing. It is expected that they will soon join forces with the three routes of Yihuang, Yongfeng to capture Ningdu. (April 6th)</p>
<h3>Large Force of Shandong Army Encircles Liu Bandit - Troops Encircle in Two Layers - Bandits Have No Way to Escape</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Liu Guitang's bandit force returned from Jiangsu on the 5th of this month and disturbed Shandong again, running between Yishui, Juxian, Linyi, and Mengyin, hoping to return to their old nest in Mengshan. Han Fuju again sent a large army to track and encircle them. Until last night (7th), the remnants of Liu's bandits fled to the Huangshanpu, Hujiazhuang, Gaozhuang, Zhuchenzhuang, Jiangshan, Longdian, Songlinzhuang, Siqianguanzhuang, Buxizhuang, and Nianzi Zhuang areas, more than 20 li southwest of Yishui County. Because the suppression of banditry was being pursued urgently, they did not dare to stay long and fled southwest overnight. By this morning (8th), the bandit force had reached the mountainous areas of Sijiaoquan Zhuang, Huya, Xiaoyaoling, Lijiaquan, Xiacangzhuang, and Jiangyu, 50 to 60 li southwest of Yishui County. Before noon, most of the bandits were in the Sijiaoquan Zhuang and nearby Yaojiadianzi, Shuiwangzhuang, Xujiayu, and Tianjiayu areas. They once tried to break out to the north from Huya but failed. Most of them then moved to the Xiacangzhuang, Lijiaquan, and Jiangyu areas. Only about one-third of them remained in the Sijiaoquan area.</p>
<p>The area occupied by Liu's bandits is surrounded by mountains on all sides. To the west are Shiniuyu, Zhenjiayu, Shanglizhuang, and Wangjiaanzi; to the north are Yanziyu, Liugongyu, Hutongyu, Cuijiayu, and Huayu; to the northwest are Motiangling, Shangweizhuang, and Xiaweizhuang; to the southwest are Nanqiangyu and Dingjiazhuang; to the south are Tianjiazhuang, Liyanjian, Yangjiaya, Xianglushan, and Majiaya; to the southeast are Yashan and Tangjiahe; to the east is T</p>
<p>Gouhuang Zhuang; to the northeast is Huangshanling. The mountains in the northwest, north, and northwest are very high, with the highest point reaching 450 meters. Only the mountains in the southeast are slightly lower.</p>
<p>The anti-bandit armies actively deployed from last (7th) night until this (8th) morning, and have strictly encircled the bandits on all sides. The west and north sides are surrounded by Sun Tongxuan's unit, the northeast is surrounded by Ning Chunxiao's unit, the east is surrounded by Li Xiangchen's unit, the southeast is surrounded by Li Xuande's unit, the south is surrounded by Ma Guanyi's unit, and the southwest is surrounded by the local militia's Xie Shuxian's unit. The encirclement is divided into two layers. The first layer is only eight or nine li away from the bandits' location, at most ten li. The west, at Zhenjiayu and Shiniuyu, the northwest, at Qiangkuangzi, and the north, at Yanziyu and Heiwang Liugongyu, are Sun Tongxuan's direct troops and Zhang Shulin's brigade. The north and northeast, at Hujia Yu, are Ning Chunxiao's brigade. The east, at Huangzhuang Du Lu Zi, is Li Xiangchen's brigade. The southeast, at Yasha Mountain Xianglushan, is Li Xuande's cavalry regiment. The south, at Yangjiaya Liyanjian, is Ma Guanyi's unit. The east, at Dingjiazhuang and Tianjiazhuang, is Xie Shuxian's unit. Soldiers can see the bandits with binoculars. The second layer is only seven or eight li away from the first layer. The west, at Shanglizhuang and Xiaweizhuang, and the north, at Shangweizhuang Motiangling Huayu Cuijiayu, are all Sun Tongxuan's unit. The northeast, at Huangshanpu, is Ning Chunxiao's unit. The east, at Longshan Guanzhuang Yuanzao Hutong, is Li Xiangchen's brigade. The southeast, at Tangjiahe, is Li Xuande's unit. The south, at Maquanyai, is Ma Guanyi's unit. The southwest, at Nanqiangyu, is Xie Shuxian's unit. Together, they form an oval-shaped large encirclement that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. In addition to the two-layer encirclement, heavy troops are deployed at important locations around the perimeter to intercept and strike if the bandits break out. In fact, the bandits have no possibility of escape.</p>
<p>The area surrounded by the army is not very large. The inner layer is no more than 14-15 li, and the east-west is only 17-18 li. Because the army is concerned about the people in the villages occupied by the bandits, it dare not use shelling immediately. Therefore, it adopts a method of gradually advancing inwards, forcing the bandits into the smallest possible area, and then destroying them together. At 10:00 AM today (8th), Liu's bandits attempted to break out north from Sijiaoquan Zhuang Li family Xia Chang Zhuang, taking the Huya path through Yanzi Yu, but were intercepted by Sun Tongxuan's unit. A fierce battle ensued, and the remnants of the bandits retreated to their original locations. Many bandits were killed in this battle, and six machine guns were captured. Li Xuande's cavalry regiment pursued them from behind, capturing six horses and more than 20 guns. It is said that a large number of mortar shells are being transported to the front, preparing to use mortars to bombard the bulk of the bandits after noon today (8th). It is also said that Xie Shuxian's unit and Li Xiangchen's brigade each killed more than 20 bandits and captured more than 10 alive, more than 10 horses, and more than 10 guns while pursuing Liu's bandits yesterday (7th).

<h3>Painful Legal Report on the Far East War</h3>
<p>— Paris Correspondence</p>
<p>The Parisian newspaper *Le Journal* on March 79th, carried a dispatch from its special correspondent in Moscow, Mr. Liu Qiane, titled</p>
<p>"The Brewing Far East War," which painfully discusses the relationship between Japan and Russia. It is worthy of our reference, and is specially translated as follows:</p>
<p>A certain Japanese diplomat stationed in Moscow always greets me with a mocking smile. Since the diplomatic relations between the Japanese Empire and the Soviet Socialist Republics have been on the verge of collapse, he has seen me waiting for news from him several times. Although he is extremely cautious, compared to his compatriots who are tight-lipped, he is relatively less inscrutable. Moreover, his English is understandable, and we can talk freely. However, what I am concerned about is his opinion on whether a Japanese-Russian conflict will occur. "We should be vigilant," said General Blücher (i.e., Galen), Commander-in-Chief of the Special Far Eastern Army, shortly before the Communist Party National Congress. "Japan is frantically preparing for war there. It is using a desperate effort to transform northern Manchuria into a fortress, from which it intends to break into our territory." In addition, Kaganovich, the most notable aide to Stalin, who usually speaks for him, also declared before the same congress, "We should prepare to deal with a foreign invasion that could happen at any time." Many foreign observers also feel that a conflict is inevitable, and the only question being discussed is the timing.</p>
<p>This is not the opinion of the person I was talking to. He pointed out to me the scaffolding partially covering the window outside his office. "Look, we are teaching them to repair our embassy, and we are paying for it ourselves." Then his smile became even more cynical. "It is evident that we have no intention of leaving Moscow. There will be no conflict because Soviet Russia is incapable of war. The situation within their country is too serious..."</p>
<p>Let us not pretend to be prophets and first examine the current situation of the Japanese-Russian relationship.</p>
<p>In Moscow, there is no doubt about Japan's invasion plans. What is being strongly emphasized here is Tokyo's territorial annexation intentions at the time of the Russian Revolution. As everyone knows, in 1918, Japan dispatched troops to land in Vladivostok. The internal crisis in Russia allowed Japan to seize the Maritime Province (the area between the Heilongjiang, Ussuri River, and the Pacific Ocean), the northern part of Sakhalin Island (the part of the island south of 50 degrees north latitude has belonged to Japan since the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905), and Outer Baikal, that is, the area east of Lake Baikal.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Russians, Japan was preparing for future annexations at that time. Tokyo also supported Admiral Kolchak of the Cossack Navy and Semyonov, who wanted to secede from Moscow and organize an Outer Baikal state, to oppose the Russian Communist Party. At that time, the United States was less interested in truly safeguarding the unity of Russia and more interested in hindering Japan's expansion. Due to the pressure from the United States, Japan withdrew its troops from Baikal in 1920, but it maintained its troops in Vladivostok until 1922.</p>
<p>In 1923, an unfortunate earthquake temporarily weakened Japan's momentum. Japan devoted itself to repairing its wounds. During this new period, its relationship with Soviet Russia improved. Then, in 1925, Tokyo and Moscow signed a treaty. According to the treaty, Japan officially recognized the Soviet government and returned the northern part of Sakhalin Island to the latter. At the same time, Soviet Russia granted Japan the right to mine coal and oil mines in Sakhalin Island, which was necessary for the Japanese fleet's supply depot.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, although the relations between the two countries occasionally experienced minor disputes over the fisheries issue in the Tsushima Strait, they remained fair. However, due to Japan's occupation of Manchuria and the direct threat to Russia's rights in the Far East, the relations between the two countries underwent a worrisome transformation.</p>
<p>From this time on, incidents occurred one after another. The most serious of these was the famous issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway. As everyone knows, the history of this railway dates back to the end of the previous century, when Imperial Russia obtained the right from China to extend the Siberian Railway through Manchuria to Vladivostok. Before the Great War, this was Russia's most powerful tool for gaining a foothold in the Far East. At the same time, Japan operated the "South Manchuria Railway Company." In fact, Manchuria was divided into two spheres of influence: Russia in the north and Japan in the south. The competition between the Russian and Japanese ports of Vladivostok and Dalian occurred simultaneously with the economic division of Manchuria. In 1924, the Soviet government, inheriting the rights of the old Russia and thus enjoying the rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway, signed an agreement stipulating that China and Russia would jointly operate the railway on an equal footing. The management of the railway was shared equally between China and Russia. Since Japan became the master of Manchuria, that joint sovereignty (if we can still call it joint sovereignty) has been transformed from Chinese-Russian to Japanese-Russian. Incidents concerning the railway have occurred one after another, and due to Japan's construction of many new railways, the commercial value of the railway has also been decreasing day by day. Therefore, in May 1933, the Soviet government proposed to Tokyo to sell Russia's rights in the railway to Japan. This was a major concession.</p>
<p>Moscow felt that it did not have enough strength and dared not risk a conflict with Japan. From a historical perspective, such an abandonment resulted in the loss of Russian influence in the Far East. This proposal was ultimately regarded as a confession of Russian weakness. From the perspective of many observers of Russian domestic politics, the severity of the food problem and the dissatisfaction in the countryside forced Soviet Russia to adopt a completely passive approach to foreign affairs. We know that the negotiations for the sale of the railway, which were once suspended in September 1933, are now about to formally resume. There are even rumors that the two sides have reached an agreement on the sale price.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese Eastern Railway issue is only one aspect of the Japanese-Russian antagonism in the Far East. To prepare for a possible conflict and to prevent its two borders from being attacked simultaneously, the Soviet government has been actively engaged in diplomatic activities for the past two years. It has approached France and Germany, and especially achieved the recognition of the United States, which has demonstrated a victory over Japan. Moscow has high hopes for cooperation with Washington. Since this reassuring prospect of cooperation with the United States emerged, the morale of the general public here has obviously risen. The tone of the Moscow press towards Tokyo has become even stronger. The recent speeches made at the Communist Party Congress in January, in addition to advocating the need for war preparedness, also strongly emphasized the various advances that the Red Army's military strength has achieved. Last month, *Izvestia* newspaper said that the Soviet army is the strongest army in the world. It goes without saying that there is some exaggeration in this. Galen, speaking amidst applause at the Communist Party Congress, said, "We have defenses in the Far East. Our borders have been locked down, surrounded by cement and iron. We have our best cadre officers there. We have the tanks and airplanes produced by our First Five-Year Plan." Although Mr. Galen did not mention any specific numbers in public, it is generally estimated that the Special Far Eastern Army has about 150,000 soldiers. In addition, the Soviet Air Force is now one of the strongest air forces in the world. According to the lowest estimate, the Soviet Union currently has 5,000 aircraft of various types. The bombers that hovered over Moscow last May Day can operate within a range of over 1,000 kilometers, which means that carrying 500 kilograms to 1 ton of bombs, these bombers can inflict fatal damage on Japan's major central areas from Vladivostok or any location in the Maritime Province. The Soviet Union now has at least 500 of these bombers, in addition to 1,500 fighters. Its arsenal is all new and is making every effort to manufacture them there. During wartime, the Soviet Union will inevitably encounter extreme difficulties in transportation, which is true. But at the moment, they are striving to rebuild and change the gauge of the Northwest Siberian Railway. Everyone feels that in terms of transportation and military affairs, the future situation may gradually favor the Soviet Union. In addition, although the domestic situation still makes the authorities worry, the unease is less than last year. The recent harvest was very good, although it suffered huge losses due to transportation delays. Finally, in the form of tax exemptions and other benefits, the government has granted many things to the peasants, especially in Northwest Siberia and border areas. Because the Soviet government realized the danger, it has since adopted a more reasonable policy towards the countryside. This does not mean that we can predict the outcome of a possible conflict. Assuming that this conflict is limited to one area (which is probably not allowed by the facts), the comparison of the strengths of the two countries is an extremely complex issue. We dare not make a rash judgment. However, whether a conflict will erupt one day soon or can be avoided through various concessions, one thing is clear: in the end, one of the two enemies must allow the other to act freely in the Far East. Just as Britain, in order to strengthen the defense of India, expanded or tried to expand its influence into neighboring countries such as Persia, Afghanistan, Nistan, Tibet, and Burma, Japan will inevitably strive to invade Mongolia and Outer Baikal in the future to protect the entrance to its abundant colony it has seized, and make the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk become a Japanese inland lake. Some people in the Soviet Union even believe that Japan aims to take advantage of China's continued chaos to disintegrate China or unify it under the rule of Puyi. A few days ago, *Izvestia* newspaper said that the Japanese taught Puyi to call himself emperor in order to unite the Chinese under the stale imperial system that Puyi ultimately represents, and at the same time, to call out the danger of communism, so that the world will recognize Japan's hegemony in Asia. Regardless of these hypotheses, we should pay attention to the evolution of this struggle that is developing in various forms in the Pacific Ocean. (Translator's note) Recently, regarding the prediction of the Russo-Japanese War in public opinion circles here, there was an article published by Mr. Poulen in the Paris Review, detailing the distant causes and recent examples of the Russo-Japanese conflict, as well as the reporter's worries about the future. Now there is Liu Qiane's Moscow correspondence in *Le Journal* (March 19), which are all readable articles. After returning from traveling in the Far East, Mr. Poulen repeatedly wrote articles in *Le Temps* and lectured at the Institute of Pacific Relations. He held a fair view on the Sino-Japanese issue, which has won the sympathy of the knowledgeable. Mr. Poulen's observations of China and Japan are consistent with the views of Mrs. Violet Leff, who went to the Far East during the Shanghai War. Mrs. Violet Leff's work on dissecting the current situation in Japan is something that ordinary newspaper reporters cannot do. However, Mr. Poulen was not obscured by the propaganda smokescreen that Japan spent tens of millions of francs on within a few months since the September 18 Incident, and was able to narrate the facts of both China and Japan to the readers nakedly. In particular, he was able to refute one by one the Chinese anarchy and the lack of national organization, which the Japanese side repeatedly slandered and fabricated. He was able to explain in detail the difficulties of China's situation, and was able to point out China's continued efforts in the face of all difficulties, as well as the slight but undeniable good results obtained from these efforts, so that readers can recognize the present and trust the future. This frank and selfless attitude and this courage to hate evil are what we admire. We thank Mr. Poulen because his writings have cleared up many misunderstandings of China by Europeans. We marvel at the boundless power of the Japanese because they have the power to incite arms merchants to interfere, causing many daily newspapers to reject Mr. Poulen's careful articles, making many facts that Mr. Poulen wanted to expose impossible to expose since they discovered that Mr. Poulen's records were detrimental to them. *Le Temps* in Paris published Mr. Poulen's China correspondence "First" on December 22 last year, but until now, there has been no sequel of Second, Third, etc. This is proof. This dispatch by Mr. Liu Qiani introduces Moscow's attitude towards Japan and the situation of the Russian military buildup, some of which we know but not in detail, and some of which we do not know. The last few lines describing Japan's ambitions can further prompt our deep reflection. (World Telegraph Agency)</p>
<h3>The Three Provinces Headquarters Expands Its Organizational Content. He and Wu Will Serve as Chief of Staff and Secretary-General Respectively. Six Departments Are Jointly Responsible for Military and Political Affairs. The Troops Transferred South Implement Political Training.</h3>

After several rounds of planning, the organizational method has been completely decided. Under the commander-in-chief and deputy commander-in-chief, there will be a chief of staff and a secretary-general, each with their own office, jointly administering six departments, namely: (1) the General Affairs Department, reorganized from the Adjutant Department; (2) the Military Affairs Department, or Staff Department; (3) the Military Supplies Department, or Logistics Department, under the Chief of Staff. Under the Secretary-General, there will be three departments: (1) the Secretariat; (2) the Political Affairs Department; (3) the Political Training Department. Each department will have a director and a deputy director. This organizational plan has been dispatched by Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, Wu Jiaxiang, and Li Tiancai to Gan, to pay respects to Chairman Chiang for instructions. It is expected to be implemented around the 15th of this month. As for the candidates for each position, it is said that they have been internally determined. The current Chief of Staff Qian Dajun will be transferred to the Nanchang camp to serve as Acting Secretary-General. Liu Chou-peng, the current Secretary-General, will also be transferred. He Zhuguo will succeed as Chief of Staff, and Wu Jiaxiang will succeed as Secretary-General. Tang Guozhen will be the Director of the General Affairs Department, and Ma Zhaoqi will be the Deputy Director. Once Chiang's reply telegram is received and approved, it will be fully announced.</p>
<p>The troops transferred south are all preparing to organize political training departments to implement political training. Li Tiancai will serve as the Deputy Director of the Political Training Department of the Pingjun Branch, stationed in Hankou, and preside over its affairs. In addition, Commander-in-Chief Chiang recently ordered the General Headquarters to instruct all bandit suppression areas in the three provinces to establish public training committees within the jurisdiction command, under the supervision and command of the jurisdiction commander, to handle public organization and training, as well as the protection of earthworks and roads. The members will be the director of the division's political training department, the division leader of the mobile team, the county magistrates of each county, and military personnel designated by the jurisdiction commander.

<h3>Remnants of Bandits on the Border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Converge and Raid Eastern Hubei. He Zhuguo Dispatches Troops to Defeat Them and Is Currently Pursuing Them. Liu Zhenhua Sets Up an Interest Bureau to Assist the Rural Areas.</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of bandits from the 25th and 28th pseudo-armies and the 23rd guerrilla force in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui recently took advantage of the transfer of national troops to jointly raid the area bordering Huangma in eastern Hubei, attempting to break through the defense line of the 57th Army of He Zhuguo in eastern Hubei. Although there are fewer than 3,000 bandits, Wu Huanxian and Xu Haidong, the two bandit leaders, are personally commanding, so the momentum is quite strong. He Zhuguo, stationed in Songbu, immediately dispatched troops to suppress them. There have been two contacts in recent days, and He's troops have defeated the bandits in both instances, capturing many. Currently, the main force of the bandits has fled to Dadong Mountain, and a small force has fled into Shangcheng County in Henan Province. He's troops are currently pursuing them. The 67th Army of Wang Yizhe has also concentrated in Luoshan and Huangchuan, and is coordinating with the troops of Song Tiancai and Liang Guanying to encircle and suppress them. He Zhuguo was originally scheduled to come to Hankou on the 9th to pay respects to Zhang Xueliang, but because he went to Zhongguan Station on that day to inspect the Chang Jingwu Division, and because the spring rain made the road difficult, he changed it to within two or three days. Wang Yizhe will also come to Hankou to pay respects to Zhang after meeting with Liang Guanying in Xinyang. He Zhuguo, newly stationed in eastern Hubei, urgently needs to clarify discipline, so he issued two proclamations, which are recorded as follows: (1) "Since the dispatch of this army, all matters concerning the supply of personnel and horses and public and private supplies must be self-provided and must not be taken from merchants and civilians. All departments have been notified and announced to all in the case. Now that the various troops have successively arrived in Hubei, the following prohibitions must be absolutely observed: (1) At no time is it allowed to forcibly conscript civilians for service; (2) Regardless of the location, military and civilian transactions must be fair buying and selling; (3) All officers must not enter civilian residences without permission; (4) Absolutely prohibit immoral behavior. All of the above items must be strictly observed by all officers and soldiers of this army. If there are unscrupulous people who deliberately violate them, you merchants and civilians are allowed to send them to the army, or file a complaint by name. Once verified, they will be shot on the spot without leniency. In addition to distributing this to all departments, it is urgent to announce it to merchants and civilians so that they are all aware." (2) "This army was previously stationed in various places along the Pinghan Line, and all public and private supplies were purchased by ourselves. There has never been a place to obtain supplies from the local area. Now that this army has been transferred to this place, all matters will still be handled according to the old practice. The supply of personnel and horses is provided by this army, and even the private residences of officers and soldiers are rented at market prices. Even if it is difficult to purchase daily necessities and it is necessary to borrow them locally, the department above the regiment level should issue formal receipts according to the handover procedures. As for the trade of goods, fair trade should be especially fair. Merchants and civilians should not raise prices indiscriminately or disrupt finance. Military personnel should not force sales or interfere with order. If there are unscrupulous military personnel who do not comply with the regulations, merchants and civilians are allowed to send them to the army, or file a complaint by name, and they will be severely punished according to the law. In addition to ordering all departments to comply, it is urgent to announce it to merchants and civilians so that they are all aware."</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, believes that the rural economy in the border area has been completely bankrupted due to the frequent banditry over the years. Now that the remnants of the bandits have been gradually suppressed, the people are returning in increasing numbers, but the fields are barren and they are unable to cultivate them. In order to seek relief, it has been decided to establish an Interest Bureau in the border area, specializing in providing farmers with low-interest loans and the supply of agricultural tools and seeds, so that the returning refugees will not abandon spring plowing. The organizational rules of the bureau have been drafted by the border area headquarters, and the opinions of the three provincial governments have been sought. It can be established within days.

<h3>Aircraft Reconnaissance Shows No Trace of Liu's Bandits in Soviet Territory. Wang Jun's Special Train Passes Through Xuzhou and Goes to Bian.</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Liu Guitang's bandit troops, between Jiangsu and Shandong, have been repeatedly suppressed by the troops of Wang Jun and Han Fuju. After fleeing back to eastern Shandong, there are currently no traces of bandits in northern Jiangsu. Yesterday (8th), two aircraft from the air force bombing squadron that arrived in Xuzhou flew to eastern Shandong for reconnaissance. There were no traces of bandits in Linyi, Yishui, Ju County, or Tancheng. Wang Jun believed that the bandits had deeply infiltrated into Shandong, and the Shandong army had already dispatched a large part of its forces to suppress them. He then ordered the 7th Division to strictly defend the border of Jiangsu, in order to prevent the bandits from fleeing south again. He then returned to Xuzhou Station by special train from Xinpu this morning (9th) at about 6:00 am. In response to Liu Zhi's telegram invitation, he did not get off the train, but continued west on the original train to Bian. He only summoned Sun Ming, the chief of staff of the staff department, to the train to talk. Wang said, "The remnants of Liu's bandits have mostly fled back to the Aishan Dike area north of Yibei. Our army is strictly defending the line blocking Ganyu and Pixian, Zhu Duji, Chenjia Menlou, Cangshan, Daxu Mountain, Jiagushan, Heilin Town, and other places. The bandits are now more than a hundred miles away from the border of Jiangsu, but the bandits are prone to fleeing, so we must block their path south in advance." Fortunately, the defense was very fast this time when the bandits entered Jiangsu. The villages through which the bandits passed were less damaged because they had not been occupied. Ganyu urban area is currently handling post-disaster affairs, and it is feared that it will be difficult to restore it in the short term. The central aircraft inspected separately yesterday morning. Aircraft No. 65 passed through Pixian, Linyi, Yishui, Ju County, etc., and Aircraft No. 66 passed through Jiagushan, Cangshan, Tancheng, Ganyu, Qingkou, Xinpu, etc. They all returned to Xuzhou in the afternoon and found no trace of bandits. This morning, the Xuzhou detachment leader drove an aircraft to eastern Shandong for inspection and landed in Linyi to meet with a Shandong aircraft. Because the bandits are far away from Xuzhou, it is inconvenient to travel back and forth. They may fly to Jin to assist in the suppression within days. (9th)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong Visits Taiyuan - Inspecting the Political Situation and Disaster Area Losses -</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Minister of Interior Huang Shaohong came to Jin from Ping the night before last. Yesterday (5th), he transferred to the Zhengtai Express train and arrived in Taiyuan at 7:05 pm. Mr. Huang's mission this time is to inspect the various construction projects in Shanxi Province and the disaster area losses. It is reported that he will not stay long and will take the road to Datong after meeting with Yan Xishan, and then go to Suiyuan for inspection, and handle the aftermath of the Sun army. The following is a record of Mr. Huang's arrival in Ping:</p>
<p>Earlier, the Liaison Section of the Pacification Headquarters specifically secured special rooms 17 and 27 and six regular rooms at the Datong Hotel in Taiyuan, preparing them as residences for Mr. Huang and his entourage. Section Chief Xue and Song Zhizheng of the section also went to the station to prepare everything, and the Pacification Headquarters sent a team each of military police and constabulary to the station for security. At that time, many important military and political figures from this province also went to the station to welcome him. After Huang got off the train, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one as a courtesy, and then went to the Shanxi Hotel to rest. The reporter briefly talked with Huang on the journey, asking what other tasks he had besides inspecting the political situation and disaster area losses. Huang replied that there were none, and that he came to Ping to see friends. He also asked if Mr. Yan would be unable to come to Ping in recent days, would he go to the riverside? Huang did not answer, only saying that he planned to stay in Ping for two or three days. After arriving at the Shanxi Hotel, he reminisced with everyone in the hotel's large hall. Zhao Daiwen was the most talkative, and often made the hall laugh. Those who came with Huang included Huang's secretary Shi Chushen, adjutants He Zhiwu and Zhou Jieying, and many others. According to Secretary Shi, Minister Huang's visit to Ping this time is to inspect the politics of Shanxi, stay for two or three days, and then transfer to Suiyuan for inspection, and will return to Beijing from Sui via Ping. That day, Yan Xishan received news of Huang's arrival in Ping and immediately telegraphed the Sui Headquarters to set up a banquet to welcome Huang. At 7:00 pm that night, the banquet was set up in the Sui Headquarters' Zhonghe Zhai. More than 20 important military and political figures from this province, including Zhao Daiwen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, Zhu Shouguang, Li Shengda, Yang Yaofang, Sun Huanlun, Lu Jinli, and Geng Guiting, accompanied him. The conversation was very pleasant. Huang praised the various construction projects in this province. The banquet was dismissed at 9:00 pm. (April 6th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Ning Tea Exchanged for Polish Goods. The Polish Minister to China Expresses His Welcome. The Provincial Construction Department Requests an Appropriation of 200,000 Yuan for a Pilot Project.</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Provincial Construction Department previously planned to exchange Ning tea for Russian oil, but the negotiations failed. It then contacted Poland. It has now received a letter from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Polish Minister to China has sent a memorandum to the ministry, requesting to exchange Chinese tea for Polish goods, and requested that the memorandum be translated for reference. The Construction Department believes that since Poland has requested to exchange goods for Chinese tea, it is an excellent opportunity to develop the province's Ning tea, and Polish goods are also mostly needed by the province. It should start a pilot project before the province's tea market. Yesterday, it specially drafted a plan and submitted it to the provincial government, requesting a quick appropriation of 200,000 yuan to start the project. (April 9th)</p>
<h3>New Regulations for Chaozhou Salt Industry: Abolishing the Abusive Contractor System and Implementing Free Transportation and Sales</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The salt production of Chaozhou has been subject to frequent changes in the system based on the whims of officials. In the past, the salt tax was contracted out, resulting in a sharp decrease in revenue and high salt prices for the people. In coastal salt-producing areas, salt was left to rot on the ground. This year, a new system has been implemented, transforming it into "people's salt, government collection, and merchant transportation." The system divides the area into four major salt districts and establishes warehouses. Coastal salt fields are remeasured, and the salt produced is transported to the warehouses. Merchants then transport the salt from the warehouses to the interior for sale. This measure was announced and implemented on April 1st, abolishing the two contractors, Qiaoshang Dongcheng Company and Qiaoxia Limin Company. The regulations for merchant transportation announced by the Supervisory Bureau are recorded below: (1) Chaoqiao Salt Affairs are divided into Qiaoshang and Qiaoxia. Merchants are allowed to apply for transportation permits and freely transport and sell salt. (2) Merchants who obtain permits must comply with the items specified in the application form issued by the Supervisory Bureau, accurately fill it out, affix the seal of a guarantor store, and submit it for review. Once verified, a transportation permit will be issued, allowing them to declare taxes and obtain licenses for free transportation and sales at any time. (3) Applications from merchants with any of the following circumstances will be rejected: (A) Failure to comply with the items stipulated in the application form or inaccurate filling; (B) The guarantor store is not substantial; (C) Non-national or containing foreign capital; (D) Engaged in salt production or soy sauce business; (E) Previous conviction for salt smuggling; (F) Currently serving in salt affairs agencies. (4) If a licensed carrier violates salt laws or engages in other malpractices, they will be punished according to law, and their permit will be revoked, and their business suspended. (5) Tax rates for Qiaoshang and Qiaoxia: (A) Qiaoshang borrowed and distributed Fujian salt: In addition to paying four jiao (角, tenth of a yuan) of silver dollars per dan (擔, a unit of weight) at Xipu He Li in Fujian, an additional two yuan and one jiao of silver dollars will be levied per dan upon transportation back to Chaoqiao. If distributing salt from Chaozhou salt farms, two yuan and five jiao of silver dollars will be levied per dan. (B) Qiaoxia distributes salt from Chaozhou salt farms, levying one yuan and five jiao of silver dollars per dan. If borrowing and distributing Fujian salt, no deduction will be made, and the salt tax paid in Fujian will also be collected at one yuan and five jiao per dan. (6) All existing surcharges and fees must be paid in accordance with regulations. (Note: These surcharges are numerous, approximately equal to the regular tax.) (7) If tax rates change, all carriers must comply and pay accordingly. (8) If a licensed carrier fails to declare taxes and distribute salt for more than one month, their permit will be revoked. (9) These regulations will take effect on the date of promulgation. At the same time, the Supervisory Bureau announced temporary regulations for cracking down on salt smuggling and regulations for the distribution and sale of salt in various locations. Commissioners have been dispatched to seal up the salt previously monopolized by Limin Company in various districts. Salt merchants in Qiaoxia believe that the heavy surcharges have increased the cost by one yuan per dan compared to when Limin Company handled the monopoly. They are taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not yet applied for licenses to operate. (April 3rd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Recent Situation of River Dredging</h3>
<p>The city river of Songjiang has been silted up for a long time since it was dredged in the 6th and 14th years of the Republic of China. A decision has now been made to dredge it again. In the past, river works were supervised by officials and managed by gentry, utilizing the agricultural off-season to develop water conservancy. According to the report on dredging the Songjiang city river in the 6th year, the east, west, south, and north sections had a total length of nine li (里, a unit of distance) and some odd measures, totaling 16,557 construction feet. The riverbed was deepened by three feet, with a total earth volume of 4,786.13 cubic feet. The cost of the project was 2,799.65 yuan, including difficult excavation and long-distance transportation. The cost per cubic foot was 0.5849 silver dollars, or 0.1785 silver dollars per cubic meter, and 0.5064 silver dollars per cubic yard. Adding water drainage, dam construction, salaries for bureau staff, and miscellaneous expenses, the total was 4,738.40 silver dollars. Even during the river dredging in the 14th year, when rice prices were high, the cost per cubic yard was still less than 0.6 silver dollars, and the total expenditure was less than 10,000 yuan. The current dredging is scheduled to begin after the Qingming Festival. All plans are managed by the technical office of the county government. The proposed budget for the project specifies a total earth volume of 87,256.1 cubic meters, equivalent to 3,0810.13 cubic yards, for the east-west main river. In addition to the earthwork cost of 0.14 silver dollars per cubic meter, equivalent to 0.4 silver dollars per cubic yard, totaling 12,215.85 yuan, there are additional costs for difficult excavation (2,908.54 yuan), long-distance transportation (14,820.55 yuan), and handling fees (2,839.72 yuan), bringing the total project cost to 32,784.66 yuan. This translates to 0.3757 silver dollars per cubic meter and 1.064 silver dollars per cubic yard, a twofold increase compared to previous labor costs. Therefore, the estimated cost of this dredging is no less than 60,000 yuan, several times higher than previous expenditures. However, when soliciting bids, local workers were mostly unclear about the distinction between earthwork cost and project cost, and thus hesitated to participate. No one bid. The three bidders were all non-locals. The winning bid was made by Taichang Gravel Company, which signed a contract with the River Works Bureau, appearing delighted. However, local workers, upon hearing that the project cost was estimated at more than one yuan per cubic yard, were all extremely disappointed.</p>
<h3>Frequent Robberies in Fengjing</h3>
<p>Tao Xiangqin's family, a farmer in Sizhuang Village, 26th Tu, East Market of Fengjing, was suddenly invaded by more than ten robbers on the evening of the 7th. They were dressed in similar clothes, with their heads wrapped in cloth, and held box cannons. They ransacked the house and escaped with their loot. As they left, Xiangqin's son was shot in the buttocks when he fired a gun. At that time, the villagers heard the alarm bell, but the robbers were not afraid at all. At the same time, three or four other families in the village were robbed, but the amount stolen was not significant. Unsatisfied, the robbers returned to Sizhuang Village on the evening of the next day to rob Tao Xiangqin's house again. Fortunately, Tao Xiangqin had taken his son, who was shot, to Shanghai for treatment and had not returned, thus avoiding the disaster. On the afternoon of the 8th, at Daganghougang outside the North Gate, near the Dazhengtang, when a Shanghai ship passed by, more than ten robbers, armed with guns, ambushed and ordered the ship to stop. The robbers boarded the ship and robbed passengers of cash, clothes, and other items, totaling over a thousand yuan, before fleeing.</p>

Wang then left for Chuansha at 3:00 yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Busting a Drug Trafficking Organization</h3>
<p>Wu Yuanyuan, originally from Guangdong, established a drug trafficking organization in Xishi, Jiulong Town, two years ago. Opium was the main commodity, sold in Haimen and Qidong counties. The business was very good, with substantial profits. However, Wu was skilled and had never been caught before. A few days ago, Wu imported a large batch of opium, which was discovered and secretly reported to the Qidong County government. The police were ordered to search the premises and seized twenty-eight packages of opium, and Wu Yuanyuan was taken to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>The Huafeng Compassionate Mat Factory, an affiliated workshop within the Yin County Relief Institute Reformatory on Liuting Street, Huxi, in this city, caught fire suddenly at around 8:00 PM on the 7th for unknown reasons. As a result, four flat buildings were destroyed, and one was demolished, with losses estimated at over 1,300 yuan. Furthermore, the raw materials stored by the Huafeng Compassionate Mat Factory, valued at 1,000 yuan, were also completely burned.

<h3>Jiashan: Three Pilgrims Trampled to Death</h3>
<p>Yu Siguan, Li Changfa, and a young Yang child, farmers from Beidou Tomb, Dingjia Village in this county, hired a boat with other pilgrims to go to the Liuwang Temple in Liansidang for pilgrimage the other day. The temple is very popular, and every year around Qingming Festival, a race is held. Ships from Shanghai and Hangzhou gather, and there are crowds of people. When the welcoming procession reached the Hongqiao of Wangjiangjing, due to the crowds, a disturbance broke out, resulting in eleven people being trampled to death, and twelve others seriously injured. It has been confirmed that Yu Siguan and the other two were also trampled to death.</p>
<h3>Salt Smugglers Rob Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Yesterday, several boats of salt smugglers arrived at Qianjingdang, southeast of Fanqing. Each boat carried seven or eight bandits with weapons. They robbed many merchant ships and fishing boats and then fled towards Yaozhuang Bridge with shouts.</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in the County</h3>
<p>On the night before last, over twenty bandits speaking the Jianghuai dialect and carrying wooden-cased guns and Mauser pistols arrived at the homes of Tao Jin and Tao Acheng in Rangxiang Village near Xitang Town in this county. They broke into the house, tied up Tao and his son with hemp ropes, and tortured them to force them to reveal where they had hidden their silver. The two men were covered in injuries, and a significant amount of cash and clothing was stolen. At the same time, the home of farmer Jiang Jinlin in the Eighth District was also robbed by bandits, with losses estimated at seventy or eighty yuan. Although the victims separately reported the incidents to the Public Security Bureau and requested a strict investigation, no arrests have been made to date. With bandits everywhere, it is difficult to sleep peacefully.</p>

<h3>Welcoming Personnel</h3>
<p>Those who went to the ship yesterday to welcome Rogers on the foreign side included Mr. Jaslan, representing U.S. Consul General Cunningham, Commercial Counselor Arnold, and Dr. Young, advisor to the Ministry of Finance. On the Chinese side, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi sent a telegram of welcome and dispatched Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, and Xi Demao, General Manager of the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Bank, as representatives to greet him. To avoid misunderstandings, most members of the banking community did not attend, planning to arrange a reception after Rogers' visit.</p>
<h3>Arrival Details</h3>
<p>The ship was originally scheduled to arrive at the port at around 9:00 PM the night before, but due to fog, it anchored outside the Wusongkou overnight. It entered the port at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked between buoys 11 and 12 on the Yangshupu River at around 8:00 AM. Chinese and foreign welcoming personnel prepared a small customs boat, Jinghui, to greet him. After exchanging greetings with Rogers and others on the ship, they transferred to the small boat and arrived at the new customs wharf at 9:00 AM. Rogers and his party went directly to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. Accompanying Rogers were his secretaries, Landman and Ichi Arnold.</p>
<h3>Rogers' Remarks</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters visited Rogers at the Cathay Hotel and were granted an interview. Rogers first stated that he had departed from San Francisco on the 23rd of last month. While the ship was in Japan, he disembarked in Yokohama and traveled to Kobe, but only briefly, before returning to the original ship for Shanghai. He continued, stating that his mission had been announced by the authorities in Washington. However, it was to observe the international situation and investigate China's silver price problem, without the need for negotiations. He planned to stay in China for about a month and visit major ports such as Beijing and Tianjin to conduct on-site investigations of local economic conditions for reference. Nanjing, as the capital of your country, should be visited first, but the date has not yet been determined. After arriving in Shanghai, he intends to rest briefly and then begin visiting Shanghai bankers and chamber of commerce leaders to solicit their opinions. In addition, he will also visit Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen to seek guidance. However, as this is his first visit to China, he is not very familiar with the situation and therefore is unable to express much. He also has no opinions on the silver price issue to express. However, he is well aware that China is a very promising country.</p>
<h3>Visit to the American Consulate</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Rogers did not go out yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 3:00, he met with Dr. Young, advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and talked briefly. At 4:00, Rogers and his secretary, Ichi Arnold, went to the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road to meet and talk with U.S. Consul General Cunningham.

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong Route: Aircraft Number 16 Missing Yesterday; Only One Japanese Passenger</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency, Shanghai: Yesterday morning, the weather was poor, with heavy fog. In order to maintain operations, all routes of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) operated as scheduled. The Shanghai-Hankou route aircraft took off at 8:30 AM from both locations and arrived at 3:00 PM respectively. The Hankou-Chongqing aircraft departed at 7:30 AM and arrived in Chongqing at 2:30 PM. The Shanghai-Beiping aircraft also arrived at 3:00 PM. However, Sikorsky aircraft number 16 on the Shanghai-Guangdong route went missing after flying out yesterday morning. According to reports, the aircraft departed at 6:00 AM yesterday. Due to heavy fog, which was not conducive to flying, it returned to Longhua at 6:30 AM. It departed again at 8:12 AM. At 8:45 AM, the aircraft still radioed the company, stating that it would fly back due to the weather. However, the aircraft had not returned by 9:00 AM. The company immediately dispatched another aircraft to search along Hangzhou Bay, but the search was unsuccessful due to the heavy fog. At 3:00 PM, the company dispatched another aircraft to search, but the weather along the route was extremely poor, with raging seas and the sky and water blending into one, making it difficult to search from the air. The search was again unsuccessful. As of 7:00 PM yesterday, the exact location of the aircraft was still unknown. CNAC has telegraphed all stations along the route, requesting them to make every effort to locate the aircraft as soon as possible. A Shenshi News Agency reporter learned from the company that there was only one Japanese passenger on the aircraft bound for Guangdong, named Zuemura. The aircraft was piloted by two American pilots.</p>
<p>After the news, the reporter's investigation last night revealed that the aircraft was equipped with the latest engine, the fuselage was stable, and the pilots were very skilled and reliable. There should be no other concerns. It is believed that due to the poor weather yesterday, the aircraft landed at a safe location to avoid danger, and the communication may have been disrupted due to the weather.</p>

<p>New Life Movement</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Labor Sector Propaganda: Municipal Federation of Labor Holds a Congress; Over 300 Representatives Attend</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the labor sector propaganda day for New Life Movement Week. The Municipal Federation of Labor held a New Life Movement Congress at the Children's Propaganda Corps in Xiaoximen at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, gathering representatives from various labor unions. It also dispatched personnel to various labor unions to distribute propaganda materials, post slogans, and supervise workers in carrying out general cleaning and other tasks. The New Life Movement Congress at the Children's Propaganda Corps was attended by Lu Jingshi, a director from the New Life Movement Promotion Association, for guidance. The Municipal Federation of Labor appointed Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Ye Xiangdi as the presidium of the congress, Shao Xubai as the recorder, and Long Peiyun as the master of ceremonies. Police officers and boy scouts were present to maintain order. The details of the congress are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>The representatives who attended yesterday included Zheng Asan from the Paper Making Union of the Fourth District, Zhu Liantang from the Water and Electricity Union of the Fourth District, Zhou Yong from the Water and Electricity Union, Gu Fuzhang from the Dried Goods Union, Jin Dongting from the Kerosene Union, Ye Xiangdi from the Shipbuilding Wood Industry Union, Hu Zufu from the Soy Sauce Industry Union, Ge Tangting from the Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Fifth District, Xiang Zelin from the Soap and Pharmaceutical Industry Union of the Ninth District, Zhu Xuefan from the Postal Workers' Union, Wang Bingkui from the Wine Making Industry Union, Zhou Xuexiang from the Cigarette Industry Union of the Fourth District, and over 300 others.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremonial greetings, Chairman Zhu Xuefan gave a report, stating that since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the whole country has responded unanimously. The reason for this is that the meaning of the New Life Movement is to enable the lives of people across the country to be in line with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, suitable for modern survival, and worthy of being modern citizens, citizens of civilized countries. It also expresses the high knowledge and morality of the people across the country. Therefore, for the New Life Movement, we only need to start from ourselves, start from small things, and if 400 million compatriots can eliminate all bad habits and promote China's inherent good morality and adopt the strengths of the West in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, then the nation will have a day of revival. The labor sector has never lagged behind in various movements, and it is especially easy to implement and effective this time. Therefore, we should make extra efforts for the New Life Movement. Chinese workers, in terms of numbers, account for the majority of the entire nation, and in terms of strength, are also extremely important. Therefore, if workers can first do it conscientiously, it will have a great impact on the entire nation.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, Lu Jingshi, a director from the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, gave a speech, stating that since February 19, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a detailed report on the New Life Movement at the memorial week in the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters, all parts of the country have attached great importance to it. The so-called New Life Movement is to thoroughly transform the existing corruption, decline, and laxity of the Chinese nation, and create a lively, disciplined, and moral expression in all aspects of the entire nation's life. Therefore, we cannot ignore the New Life Movement because it starts from small things. We must know that the only way to revive the nation is to start from these things. Foreigners have a very agile and lively spirit in researching science and managing industry and commerce, so their material civilization has progressed rapidly. We must emulate this spirit in order to revive the nation.</p>
<h3>Slogans</h3>

<h3>Huge American Cotton Imports</h3>
<p>After the loan-secured American cotton shipment to China was halted, Shanghai merchants and factories have been finding ways to expedite the shipping of American cotton purchased directly. Yesterday, the American ship "Houston City" arrived, carrying 11,750 bales of American machine-spun cotton, worth 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan, which were unloaded at Zhangjiagang. A second batch of American cotton, worth 1 million yuan, is being carried by the "Ville de Lyon" and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Ships Speed Up Installation of Silver Vaults</h3>
<p>Due to the frequent occurrence of pirate ship robberies, Shanghai shipping companies are actively installing anti-theft measures on their ships.

<h3>Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Association Sends Telegram to the Whole Country Urging the Use of Domestic Goods, Foreign Light Bulbs are Actually Made in Shanghai, Same Quality but Higher Price, Those Infatuated with Foreign Goods Can Be Awakened</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Association sent a telegram to the National Chamber of Commerce and trade associations yesterday, urging the use of domestic electrical appliances. "To all chambers of commerce and electrical appliance associations across the country, the current situation is that rural areas are bankrupt, and all industries are declining to the extreme. Tracing the cause, it is the influx of foreign goods, resulting in countless amounts of money flowing out every year, leading to an economic decline throughout the country. In this environment, we should strive to improve ourselves and vigorously promote domestic goods to make up for the losses and stabilize the livelihoods of the people. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by the efforts of one or two people. It is necessary for the whole country to be united and for production and sales to cooperate in order to achieve results. Before the founding of the Republic of China, our country had few products in the electrical appliance industry, and everything relied on foreigners. Therefore, at that time, the prices of various electrical appliances were surprisingly high. When a domestic electrical appliance factory was established and a certain product was produced, the price of the corresponding foreign product would immediately fall. Over the past twenty years, the number of domestic factories has increased, and domestic electrical appliances have become increasingly complete. Moreover, their quality is not inferior to that of foreign goods, and there is no need for foreign goods at all. The reason why foreign goods can still be active within our country is due to the psychological worship of foreign goods by the Chinese people. What people do not know is that the so-called foreign goods are not made in foreign countries and imported from overseas. In fact, they are manufactured in our country. Taking light bulbs as an example, domestic light bulb factories could only produce long-filament bulbs at first. Later, they were able to produce coiled-coil bulbs, and finally, they were able to manufacture half-watt bulbs. However, there are many types of half-watt bulbs. At first, 155 watts was the highest limit, but now 200, 300, and 500 watts can be manufactured. Their durability is no less than that of foreign goods. All brands of foreign light bulbs are manufactured by one factory in Shanghai. The raw materials and manufacturing methods are exactly the same. The only difference is that the capital is from foreign merchants and not from Chinese. The reason why they do not manufacture in foreign countries and set up factories in our country is solely to avoid our country's tariffs. The Chinese people do not realize that goods sold by foreign companies must be foreign goods, and that foreign goods must be different from domestic goods. Is this not injustice? Moreover, they are the same goods, but foreign goods are more expensive while domestic goods are cheaper. Buying foreign goods is wasting money, while buying domestic goods is self-help. Which is more beneficial to the country and to oneself? Knowledgeable people can tell the difference. Our association is sincerely informing you of what we know. We hope that you will carefully consider it."</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Workers from the Mayar Silk Factory Surrounded the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday to Petition, The Factory Decided to Close Down, Mediation Was Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that after the labor-capital dispute over wage reductions at the Mayar Silk Weaving Factory, although Party and government agencies have made every effort to mediate, there has been no result. Yesterday, a large group of workers surrounded the Social Affairs Bureau. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Mediation Was Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau had scheduled to continue the mediation committee meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The representatives of the workers from the main and branch factories of the factory arrived at the bureau on time, but the capital representatives did not arrive. According to the capital's report on the reasons for non-attendance, the factory has decided to close down. The goal of the mediation meeting convened yesterday was to mediate the issue of wage reductions. Since the factory intends to close down, whether or not wages are reduced is no longer an issue, so there is no need to send representatives to attend. Since the capital representatives did not arrive, yesterday's mediation meeting broke up without any results.</p>
<h3>Surrounding the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>The workers from the 7th and 10th factories of the factory, due to the capital stopping food supply, all the workers, starting at 3:00 PM yesterday, went to the downtown area one after another to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. There were over a thousand male and female workers, with female workers being the majority. The purpose of the petition was to demand that the factory maintain the food supply and resolve the issue immediately. After repeated persuasion by Wang Guangqing, the director of the mediation section of the Third Department of the Bureau, the workers were promised that the factory would be responsible for maintaining the food supply, but it was still ineffective. The workers also expressed disbelief in their representatives, becoming more and more leaderless, shouting and clamoring, and the order was greatly disrupted. Although the Public Security Bureau and the Security Team sent police officers to maintain order, they were unable to disperse the crowd due to the large number of people. Until the Bureau was about to close, the workers surrounded the area, lying across the main roads, only allowing people to enter, not allowing people to leave. As a result, the staff of the Education and Health Bureaus were also unable to leave after work. As of the time of this reporter's dispatch, the staff of the three bureaus were still hungry and trapped in the bureau, forming a stalemate. According to the Great Gazette, as of 10:00 PM, the workers had not yet left.</p>
<h3>Shanghai North China Products Fair Closed Yesterday, Participating Factories Organizing for Closure, Future Exhibitions Will Be Held Elsewhere</h3>
<p>The Shanghai North China Products Exhibition, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, opened on the 22nd of last month and was originally scheduled to last for two weeks, closing on the 4th of this month. Later, due to the need for an extension, the manufacturers' representatives decided to extend the exhibition for one week, until it closed yesterday (the 10th) afternoon. The ceremony was simple, and the temporary sales outlets set up by the manufacturers were busy organizing for closure. According to the person in charge of the association, the purpose of the association's mobile exhibition is to promote domestic products and promote industry so that the public will abandon foreign goods and buy domestic goods, not to make profits. This time, the three-week exhibition in the war-torn north of Shanghai was somewhat gratifying. In the future, we will choose another place to exhibit and work hard to promote so that all regions have the opportunity to recognize genuine domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Improved Tea Coloring Material, Tea Industry Colleagues Have Established a Factory to Specialize in Manufacturing, Tea Coloring in the Future Should Use the Factory's Coloring Material, Abolishing the Prohibition and Free Coloring is Definitely Not True</h3>
<p>The quantity of our country's green tea sold to North America was originally huge, but later, because the tea shipped was using coloring material, it was banned from import. The great and good market was thus ruined. In recent years, although colored tea can still be imported into Africa and other places, there are restrictions on the use of coloring material. If the quality of the colored tea is not pure, it will be banned from import, which has a significant impact on the foreign trade of tea. At the beginning of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's implementation of tea inspection, it held an absolute prohibition policy on the export of colored tea. Later, in order to sympathize with the business situation, it specially approved the Ministry of Industry to adopt a gradual elimination method. In addition to stipulating that most places are absolutely not allowed to export, those in Africa and other places can still be shipped for sale within a considerable period of time. However, in order to adapt to the situation in the place of sale, the quality of the coloring material used must be strictly controlled. Last year, special collection of commonly used coloring materials for colored tea was carried out for chemical testing, and it was found that sand green, three fish yellow, etc. are indeed unsanitary for drinking. Therefore, experts researched and invented a variety of improved coloring materials, which were given to local Chinese and foreign tea merchants for trial use, and they all agreed that their effectiveness was indeed better than the old coloring materials. The Shanghai Tea Industry Association has established a factory to manufacture them, and tea merchants in all regions should uniformly use them to avoid being banned from export for using inferior coloring materials. The price of the coloring material is very low. This solution during the transitional era is truly great news for our country's tea industry. The current policy of the Commodity Inspection Bureau is to formulate tea coloring standards on the one hand, gradually reduce the color intensity, and reach the point where no coloring is used at all. On the other hand, it stipulates that the tea coloring should generally use improved coloring materials, and the old and inferior coloring materials should be strictly prohibited. Recently, it was reported that the bureau "reissued an announcement to lift the ban, and since the prohibition has been lifted, it should be possible to color freely according to the old rules," etc. All of these are misreports and are definitely not true.</p>
<h3>Citizens' National Products Promotion Association Commends Chen Yiting, Representative to Hankou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, leading the Shanghai National Products Touring Delegation to participate in the Hankou National Products Mobile Exhibition, has ended its term and closed. The entire factory delegation returned to Shanghai on the 5th. It is reported that the association has scheduled a factory representatives' meeting at 3:00 PM on the 12th of this month to report on the association's affairs and review the accounts. In addition, a public banquet was held at Yuebinlou last night at 6:00 PM to commend comrades Chen Yiting and Chen Jusheng, the general representatives to Hankou, and Xu Jianruo, Dong Boying, Sun Daosheng, Lin Guyun, Xu Yunhui, Zhang Dezai, Qian Lijun, Chen Xin, Gu Bingyuan, Shi Bingyang, Hu Zhenjia, Xu Jianfan, and other representatives from 88 factories who attended. After three rounds of drinks, Lu Wenshao was elected as the representative to give a commendation speech, which stated that promoting national products is the most important basic work in the new life movement under the severe national crisis, and it is especially the main purpose of this association. Participating in national exhibitions in various places is the most effective way to promote national products. At the invitation of Mayor Wu, the Hankou National Exhibition of National Products contributed to the plan of sending national products to the whole country, led the National Products Touring Delegation to participate, gave the people of Wuhan a deep impression of national products, and opened up the Central China sales channels for the products of various factories. The achievements were excellent, creating an unprecedented record for the National Exhibition of National Products. We are deeply gratified for the future of national products. Comrade Chen Yiting, the general representative to Hankou, has been working hard for the national products cause for more than 20 years, being selfless and dedicated, working hard, traveling long distances, and not being afraid of hardship, seeking development for national products and seeking benefits for various factories. His enthusiasm for saving the country and his spirit of service are worthy of admiration and respect. This time, leading the trip to Hankou, he took on the heavy responsibility, guided the progress, and returned with honor. Comrade Chen's sacrifice of spirit, time, and money is even greater, and his selflessness makes us feel deeply uneasy and express our utmost respect. In the future, we hope that Comrade Chen will intensify his work under hardship, open up new sales channels for all Shanghai national products factories, and make a unique contribution to our national products cause. All the comrades present, please raise your glasses to commend Comrade Chen and wish Comrade Chen success. Then, Chen Yiting replied, saying that serving national products is the duty of a citizen and that he will do his best, regardless of hardship. He is ashamed to have received a banquet from the comrades tonight, and that the achievements of the Hankou exhibition were due to the low prices and good quality of the products of various factories, the dedication and cooperation of the representatives of various factories, and the enthusiastic promotion by Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life, as well as the support of the people of Wuhan for national products. In the future, he will do his best to follow the comrades and advocate for national products. He is deeply grateful for the kind and generous feelings. Then, Sun Daosheng, Zhang Dezai, Xu Yunhui, Lin Guyun, and others gave speeches. The banquet ended at 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Director of the News Bureau of the Soviet Embassy in China, Volinsky, Dies</h3>
<p>Shanghai, April 10 (TASS) - Volinsky, Director of the News Bureau of the Soviet Embassy in China, died last night (9th) at 11:00 PM. Volinsky had been in Shanghai for less than a month. He was confined to bed due to a heart attack from a chronic illness that had plagued him for many years. Volinsky was born in 1882 and participated in the Russian revolutionary movement very early. In 1903, he was arrested by the Tsarist Russian government and exiled to the Yakutsk region of Eastern Siberia. In the darkest era of Tsarist tyranny, he participated in the historically valuable resistance of political exiles in Yakutsk in 1904. This resistance was triggered by the abuse of the then-governor of Yakutsk Province. As a result, Volinsky was sentenced in 1904 to twelve years of hard labor in Siberia. However, in 1905, he escaped from the famous Alexandrovsk Central Prison in Irkutsk. He crossed the great Siberian forest by ox cart in the winter of that year and finally fled abroad, arriving in London. In London, he served as the secretary of the Furniture Carpenters Association. From 1911 onwards, Volinsky served as a railway surveyor in England, Spain, Africa, Argentina, and Australia. He was the captain of the survey team when new railways were built in Australia, Brazil, and Argentina, with excellent results. After the revolution of 1917, he returned to Russia, worked for the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and served as the director of the news bureau of the Soviet diplomatic mission in the Baltic countries and Mexico. Volinsky, who was recently appointed to this position, was previously one of the directors of the Moscow Underground Road Construction Project.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Finds a Large Sum of Money; Returns Home to Become a Wealthy Man; Incident Exposed and Arrest Made After Ten Months</h3>
<p>Han Meicen, a native of Hebei, is thirty years old. He previously served as the secretary-general of the 21st Division Headquarters of the Army. On June 20th of last year, he left Nanchang with his wife, Mrs. Niu, for Shanghai. Via Jiujiang and Nanjing, they arrived in Shanghai on the 24th. They then went to Hangzhou for about two weeks, returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou on July 8th. They stayed at the Yipinxiang Hotel for one night and then moved to Room 1, Central Apartments, No. 274 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. When Han set off from Nanchang, the quartermaster, Du Menghua, gave him a 2,000 yuan draft from the Bank of China, instructing him to purchase raincoats and other military supplies in Shanghai. After Han arrived in Shanghai, he went to the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China and obtained 2,000 yuan in cash (all ten-yuan notes). Together with his own private funds of 1,450 yuan, he placed it all in a yellow briefcase and carried it with him to prevent carelessness. On the evening of July 14th, at about 7 p.m., Han and his wife, Mrs. Niu, left the Central Apartments. They walked to the vicinity of Avenue Foch and Rue de Luzon and hired two rickshaws to visit their friend Fan Shaoxian at No. 33 Xiafei Lane, Avenue Joffre. They put the briefcase on the rickshaw. When the rickshaws arrived at the entrance of Xiafei Lane, Mr. and Mrs. Han got out of the rickshaws, paid the rickshaw pullers two jiao, and went straight into the lane, forgetting the briefcase on the rickshaw. The rickshaw pullers, seeing that the passengers had forgotten the briefcase, did not inform them but instead ran away with the rickshaws. Mr. and Mrs. Han met Fan at his home, talked for about half an hour, and then hired rickshaws to return to the Central Apartments. When they arrived at the intersection of Avenue Foch, Han remembered the briefcase, but he was not sure whether he had taken it with him. He went back to Fan's house and rushed to the Central Apartments to inquire about the whereabouts of the briefcase. The tea room attendant of the apartment, Hu A'er, testified that he had seen the couple leave the apartment with the briefcase. At this point, Han realized that the briefcase had been forgotten on the rickshaw and must have been stolen by the rickshaw pullers. He reported the matter to the French police and asked them to investigate. The head detective dispatched detective Tao Desheng to investigate. Because Han had not identified the numbers of the rickshaws at the time, there was no way to start the investigation. They could only try to investigate carefully. Han lost this large sum of public and private money, and it was difficult to recover the stolen goods. He could only lament his helplessness. Until recently, after ten months, the deputy detective of the French police, Wang Zhihao, received a secret report from an informant that the rickshaw pullers who stole the large sum of money were Ding Kezao (22 years old) and Wang Xuekuan (57 years old), both from Dongtai. They had fled back to their hometown of Dingjia Homestead in Anfeng Town, Dongtai County, and abandoned their rickshaw pulling business, living the life of wealthy men. Detective Wang immediately reported this to the French inspector and requested the Second Special District Court to prepare a document and go to the Dongtai County Government with detective Ma Changxin to report the matter and request the dispatch of police to secretly go to the address to arrest the two criminals, Ding and Wang. On the 2nd of this month, they were transferred to Shanghai, and the next day they were sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Sun Peng, recommended by the judge, went to the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered Ding and Wang to be brought to court for further trial. According to Yuan Jiahuan, the lawyer of the police station, the investigation procedures of the police station in this case were not yet complete, and he requested an extension of seven days to investigate the case and notify the plaintiff to file a lawsuit. The court approved the request and ordered a postponement of the investigation and trial until the 17th. The two defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>
<h3>Leaf Open-Hearted's Car Crushes and Kills a Person; Driver Fined Four Hundred Yuan; Compensation Part Transferred to Civil Court</h3>
<p>Ye Kaixin, a native of Hunan, who has served as a member of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, Commander of the Fourth Army, and Commander of the 52nd Division, came to Shanghai as a retiree after resigning from his military post, residing at No. 165 Dakang Lane, Seymour Road. He owned a private car with the license plate number 8001 and hired Chen Caihao as the driver. On February 24th of this year, at 2 p.m., Ye went out by car, driven by Chen Caihao. When passing the intersection of Changping Road and Gordon Road, Chen drove carelessly and knocked down a Jiangbei peddler named Wang San, injuring him. Chen did not stop to help but instead accelerated and fled. He was caught by Chinese police officer No. 3233 on duty and taken to the Gordon Road police station. The injured person was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died on the 28th due to his serious injuries. Because the police did not file a public prosecution, Wang Chen, the wife of the deceased, hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to file a lawsuit against Chen and Ye in the First Special District Court, requesting that Chen be charged with the crimes of Articles 291, Paragraphs 1 and 2, and that Ye be ordered to pay compensation for funeral expenses of 7,200 yuan and coffin expenses of 160 yuan. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court for the trial. Ye Kaixin did not appear in court and hired lawyer E Sen as his agent. The plaintiff's lawyer attacked Ye's absence, saying that Ye had been summoned by the court and should have appeared in court to be questioned, but he refused to appear, which was contempt of the law. Lawyer E immediately replied that the plaintiff only accused Ye of civil disputes and could be represented by a lawyer according to law. Judge Feng then questioned witness No. 3233, a Chinese police officer, who said that the defendant's car had honked the horn when it was five or six yards away from the deceased, but the deceased did not hear it. The place where he was hit was on the rear wheel fender. The car did not stop at that time. I chased him to the intersection of Binlang Road before I caught him. The court questioned him based on the police record and the prosecutor's autopsy report, which stated that the deceased was hit by the front bumper of the car. Why do you say today that he was hit by the fender? The police officer replied that the record might be wrong. The court immediately said that there was no such coincidence of error and reprimanded him. Then he questioned the defendant Chen Caihao, who claimed that the deceased was careless himself. Finally, the court ruled that Chen Caihao was guilty of causing death due to negligence in his business and fined him 400 yuan. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court of this court for trial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Reduce Rent Promotion Association; Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday; Decided to Notify All Associations to Join; Declaration Issued to Implement the Initial Intention of Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South District Trade Association's Rent Reduction Promotion Association held its first preparatory meeting at the Nanshi Fisheries Association at 4 p.m. yesterday. Jin Chuxiang, Hong Songjiong, Shao Guoyong, and more than a dozen others attended. It was decided to issue a declaration of the preparatory committee and solicit membership applications. The meeting adjourned at 5:45 p.m. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Resolutions Passed</h3>
<p>The meeting began with formalities. Chairman Jin Chuxiang reported the resolutions of the previous meeting. Then, the following motions were discussed: (1) The motion to publish a declaration in various newspapers (resolved) to be handled after the date of the general meeting is determined; (2) The motion to notify various trade associations to join this association (resolved) to be passed; (3) The motion to schedule a joint meeting of various trade associations (resolved) to be handled by the Standing Committee on a regular basis; (4) The motion to recommend Hong Song, Jin Chuxiang, and Ye Yunping to draft the association's charter (resolved) to be passed; (5) The motion to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to notify various trade associations to join this association (resolved) to be handled by the documentation department; (6) The motion to send a letter to the Municipal Council explaining the organization and origins of this association and its willingness to be a backing (resolved) to be passed.</p>
<h3>Declaration Issued</h3>
<p>The association issued the following declaration: We have heard that the rise and fall of the market depend on the economy as its pivot. Today, the signs of global economic downturn are becoming increasingly profound, and Shanghai, as a major trading port in East Asia, has suffered a setback in commerce since the aftermath of the January 28th Incident. Although the reasons are complex, the tight monetary policy and inflexible turnover are among the major key reasons. Our merchants, in this dangerous environment, are eager to struggle and make efforts, so they are competing to cut prices in order to attract customers. They hope to strengthen their hearts with injections, so that they can survive. However, the purchasing power of the public is already very weak. At first, it was enough to call for a while, but in a blink of an eye, the customers were sparse again. Even if they can continue to sacrifice, it is difficult to maintain for a long time. Therefore, they are overwhelmed and exhausted. The only way out is to declare bankruptcy as a last resort. If this continues, the disaster cannot be saved. Not only is there no hope for the prosperity of Shanghai, but also the collapse is imminent. Thinking of this, it is truly heartbreaking. If there is no way to increase revenue, it is better to retreat and cut spending. This is a definite and unchanging principle in economics. In terms of the current situation, in order to maintain the dying business, the key lies in striving to save expenses. Rent is an important part of the expenses, so the urgent task is to ask for rent reduction. Moreover, the general public is suffering, and living is already difficult day and night. However, the burden of rent, compared to the past, has continued to increase, without stopping. Therefore, the public is eager to reduce rent, just like a severe drought expecting clouds. Observing the general psychology, it is so urgent. Conversely, those who own real estate are not without people with foresight and a deep understanding of justice, and they will definitely be able to understand the meaning of helping each other and automatically reduce their rent. This association, in response to the urgent urging of its members, in order to promote the realization of rent reduction in Shanghai, vows to appeal with a fair attitude and a determined spirit, in order to promote it. We hope that everyone will work together and persist without slackening, and will not stop working until the initial intention is implemented. Then we will see the revival of Shanghai, and this is actually its prelude. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Raised for Twenty-One Years; Gone and Never to Return; Ge Zhaodi Harboring Other Ambitions; Ge Wenlou, What Can He Bear</h3>
<p>Ge Zhaodi, a woman, was originally surnamed Song. She was sent to Ge Wenlou for fostering by her biological mother when she was only eighteen months old, as an adopted daughter. Ge is now fifty-two years old and a native of Qingjiang. He used to work as a mailman for a certain shipping company, earning a meager monthly income, just enough to make ends meet. After raising Zhaodi to adulthood, he sent her to school to study. At the age of fourteen, she was recommended by Ge's relatives to work as a female worker in the Lee Yew Tobacco Company, going out early and returning late, living in peace. Until today, Zhaodi is twenty-one years old, and suddenly on December 29th of last year, she left and never returned. Ge Wenlou was deeply afraid that something unexpected might happen on the way, so he reported it to the Fourth District, First Sub-District of the Public Security Bureau and asked them to investigate. Unexpectedly, on January 8th of this year, Ge Zhaodi suddenly hired lawyer Yin Jinghao to publish a statement in the newspaper, declaring that she would restore her surname to Song and sever the adoptive relationship with Ge Wenlou, as well as terminate the engagement with Shen Xiaomao's son, Xinfa. The content roughly stated that Zhaodi was raised by Ge, but since Ge married a second wife and gave birth to his own daughter, he had different intentions and did not treat Zhaodi as his own daughter. Moreover, the engagement with Shen Xiaomao's son, Xinfa, was arranged by Ge's wife, and never obtained her consent. Although she had repeatedly expressed her opposition, it was ultimately ineffective. She had no choice but to go out and make a living on her own. Zhaodi is now an adult and has the right to autonomy. Therefore, she publishes this statement to sever ties with Ge and terminate the relationship between adoptive parents, and notifies the Shen family to terminate the wrongly arranged engagement. At the same time, lawyer Yin sent a letter to Ge Wenlou, and Ge realized that Zhaodi had harbored other ambitions and did not want to return. Twenty years of nurturing and hard work were in vain. What can he bear? He hired lawyer Zhu Sifei to file a petition with the Mediation Court of the First Special District Court, requesting to live together, but it was unsuccessful. He then formally filed a lawsuit, but Zhaodi's address was unknown, and he requested a public announcement for service. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai presided over a hearing in the Seventh Civil Court and ordered a public announcement for service.</p>
<h3>Unmarried Husband Unwilling to Marry Ugly Woman; Adopted Daughter Drinks Poison in Grief; Farm Girl Unable to Avoid Pity; Zhang Hesheng Is Too Cruel</h3>
<p>Du Jinbao, a woman from Pudong, is twenty-one years old. Her father, Xiang Tao, is a farmer in the countryside. When she was young, her father betrothed her to her cousin Hesheng (who runs the Shixingguan Restaurant at No. 100 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei)'s son, Honggen, to be his wife. Three years ago, she was adopted into the Zhang family. Unexpectedly, Honggen saw that his fiancée was not very beautiful and firmly refused to marry her, practicing marriage autonomy. Therefore, although his father planned to choose an auspicious day on the second day of the eighth lunar month of last year to consummate their marriage, he always opposed it and it was difficult to achieve. Having no other choice, Honggen suddenly ran away from home, and there has been no news of him since. The woman missed him day and night and was filled with depression. A few days ago, thinking about him, she felt hopeless and wept silently, feeling more and more resentful. She suddenly had the thought of being tired of the world. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Later, her father-in-law caught a glimpse of her and immediately sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She then died. The hospital reported to the Xinza Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. They then carried the body to the Fielun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to go to the station to examine the body. After examining the body, they questioned Zhang Hesheng, who recounted the previous situation. Mr. Diao then announced that the deceased, Du Jinbao, was a woman, and she died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to Zhang Hesheng to take back for coffin burial.</p>

It is heard that the municipal party department has received a letter from the Central Secretariat, which has ordered the Ministries of Finance and Industry to draft four relief measures. The Executive Yuan considers it feasible and orders the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, and the Economic Commission to handle them. The first item is "Exempting all local silkworm cocoon and factory silk donations and taxes", which should be considered for reduction or exemption by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The second item is "Reducing the freight for mulberry seedlings and silkworm cocoons", which should be earnestly verified and reduced by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications.

<h3>Failure of Chinese Cigarette Industry's Request for Funds from the Ministry of Finance; Tax Bureau Responds that Proposal Must Come from Cigarette Business Committee</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cigarette Industry Association previously requested government funding for relief due to poor business and inferior tobacco leaves. The Ministry of Finance agreed to allocate 300,000 foreign dollars, designating the funds specifically for improving business operations and tobacco leaf quality. However, the Ministry declined to approve the Association's proposed construction of a clubhouse, citing its limited local benefit. The following is the text of the Tax Bureau's letter to the Association: "Regarding your previous letter concerning the cigarette fund allocation, which was discussed at the Third Annual General Meeting where it was decided that the funds should be managed by the Association and used for assisting in anti-smuggling efforts, improving tobacco leaves, and constructing a clubhouse, and requesting approval and prompt allocation of the funds, this matter is under review. We received a letter from the British American Tobacco Company stating that the Ministry of Finance has allocated 300,000 yuan for improving the cigarette business and requesting that Chinese companies have the right to propose ideas for the use of these funds. This Bureau submitted the case to the Minister for approval, and it was determined that the 300,000 yuan is allocated for the entire cigarette industry to improve business operations or quality. The anti-smuggling assistance and tobacco leaf improvement proposed by the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association at its annual meeting are consistent with the original approved plan to improve the cigarette business. However, the construction of a clubhouse is a matter for the Association itself, only benefiting a portion of Shanghai cigarette factories, and was not included in the original plan. Therefore, it cannot be included in this use. Furthermore, this Bureau previously formed a Cigarette Business Committee consisting of Chinese and foreign cigarette merchants to research and reorganize the cigarette business, and requested the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Association to convene Chinese and foreign cigarette merchants to establish the committee. These Chinese and foreign cigarette merchants have legitimate opinions on the use and distribution of the aforementioned funds and can directly propose them to the Business Committee. After a decision is made and approved by the Bureau and submitted for approval, the funds can be disbursed. This will eliminate disagreements and boundaries. You should comply with this process. In addition to sending a separate letter to the British American Tobacco Company, we are sending this letter to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association for your information and compliance. Sincerely, the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance."</p>

The An Tong Steamship Company requested a retrial. The decision: the company's statements and the Customs report did not prove that Da Xing was being pursued, so the request for a retrial should not be considered. (2) Regarding the San Bei Company's Heng Shan ship sinking the Ding Sheng steamboat, the captain of the Ding Sheng reported the collision. Because the Heng Shan ship sailed on the ninth, no one came to answer questions. This case will be discussed again at the next meeting. (3) Regarding the collision between the Chuan Shan Company's Chuan Shan ship and the Jin Chang Sen sailboat outside of the Shipu port in Zhejiang, the captain of the Chuan Shan ship, Cai Yechang, and the first mate, Xin Xinchang, testified about the collision. Because the Jin Chang Sen was being repaired in Fuzhou, no one came to answer questions, so no judgment was made.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Izumo Arrives</h3>

<h3>Hong Li Ship Escapes Danger After Rescue</h3>
<p>A sudden storm and heavy rain in Changde, Hunan, caused merchant ships to be stranded, but the San Bei Company's Hong Li ship escaped danger by retreating into the water during the storm and heavy rain. The strangeness of the event is unparalleled. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Hong Li Aground</h3>
<p>The Hong Li ship of the San Bei Company's Changsha line, ran aground near Xiani Port in Changsha at the end of last month due to shallow water. Multiple rescue attempts failed to tow it away. The Changsha Customs, considering it an obstruction to navigation, sent personnel to join the Changsha San Bei Branch to assist in the rescue, but it was still difficult to pull it out. The cargo was unloaded, and the rescue was postponed until the water rose again. Unexpectedly, a strong wind recently occurred, affecting the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. A storm and heavy rain occurred in the Xiang River, and the Hong Li ship was battered by the storm. The ship was pushed into the waterway in the middle of the bank, and the ship was safe.</p>
<h3>Yu Hang to the Rescue</h3>
<p>The owner of the Hong Li ship urgently requested the Changsha branch to send a ship from Shashi to rescue it to avoid losing the opportunity. When the Hong Li ran aground, the Xiang River water level was 4 feet 7 inches. After the storm, the river water sharply decreased to 4 feet and continued to decrease daily. The Shashi branch ordered the Yu Hang ship to fly to the location to rescue it. Yesterday, the San Bei Company received a telegram stating that the Hong Li ship had been rescued from the dangerous shoal by the Yu Hang ship and is now planning to sail empty to the Changsha riverbank to dock and inspect the ship for damage in preparation for repairs.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the China Patriotic Progressive Association</h3>
<p>The China Patriotic Progressive Association's declaration states, "In this autumn of international turmoil, all countries in the world are urgently expanding their military capabilities, uniting their nations, striving for progress, and working hard to become stronger in order to preserve their existing situation and national survival in the Second World War. The military-national education and arms race of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia have made astonishing progress. The future crisis is imminent. Looking back at our country since the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, we have suffered humiliation from strong neighbors, the impact of natural and man-made disasters, political chaos, rural bankruptcy, backward thinking of the people, and the decline of the aspirations of young people. The fate of the nation is in urgent need of salvation. However, corrupt elements are using religion to amass wealth, and the ignorant people are being deceived, believing that fortune and misfortune are determined by divine beings. This has become a widespread practice in all walks of life, and the spirit of the people has declined to this extreme. Young people are the future masters of the country. Young people in all countries are honing their physical and mental abilities to become the backbone of the future nation. However, most of our country's young people are arrogant, listless, and pursue vanity and entertainment. National demise and extinction are imminent. Seeing this crisis, the members of this association are shuddering with fear. Based on the principle that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, we gathered patriotic comrades on March 20th in Shanghai to establish the China Patriotic Progressive Association. Our purpose is to correct people's hearts, eliminate superstition, promote martial arts, and promote the inherent spirit of the nation. We have no partisan affiliation. We hope that all our compatriots at home and abroad will support us and provide guidance to correct our shortcomings. We humbly ask for your consideration."</p>

<h3>Ye Zhongfang's Wife Sues for Divorce</h3>
<p>Lu Shuang, from Suzhou, was previously appointed by the National Government as Consul in Kobe, Korea. He returned from his travels a few years ago and focused on business. Lu's daughter, Lu Yinglan, 26 years old, married Ye Zhongfang (nickname "Little Jitterbug"), the eldest grandson of the late Ningbo businessman Ye Chengzhong, who was living in Shanghai. Ye, who possessed a large fortune, spent his days indulging in alcohol and frequenting dance halls. In November of last year, he took a dancer, Lu Xiaomei, as a concubine and then abused his wife, Lu Yinglan, in every way. Therefore, Lu, who lived at the Shanghai Villa on Huanlong Road, hired lawyer Dong Banggan to file a petition with the Second Special Court's Mediation Division for mediation of a divorce and an order for alimony. Because Ye had moved and his address was unknown, the case could not be served, and the mediation failed. Therefore, a formal lawsuit was filed, stating that since the plaintiff's marriage, she had been repeatedly abused by the defendant. She had been beaten in the past and had filed a lawsuit in the French Court. Recently, the defendant had sold all of the plaintiff's dowry and clothing. The defendant was romantic and had taken dancer Lu Xueli as a concubine before taking dancer Lu Xiaomei as a concubine in November of last year, which led to the plaintiff's abuse and adultery. The family's happiness has been completely lost. The plaintiff is unable to continue living with the defendant and requests that a divorce be granted and that she be compensated for losses and alimony of 100,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, a summons was issued, and only the plaintiff and her lawyer, Mr. Dong, were present. The defendant was still unable to be served and did not appear in court. The judge tentatively scheduled a new date for the summons and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Lost and Found Leather Bag: Commendable Integrity of a Shanghai Public Bus Inspector</h3>
<p>Longhua is one of Shanghai's famous scenic spots. During the bright spring when peach and plum trees are blooming, tourists are as numerous as clouds and never-ending. Especially on holidays, it is even more lively. Longhua Road is almost like the Shanyin Road. Last Sunday (the 8th), a gentleman took his family to visit Longhua. After the visit, they boarded a public bus of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to return home. Because the passengers were extremely crowded, there was barely room to stand. The gentleman's family inadvertently left their leather bag on the bus in a hurry. The bus inspector found it and submitted it to the management office for safekeeping. The office then sent a letter to the gentleman based on the name and address filled in on the park ticket in the leather bag, asking him to find a guarantor and come to claim it in person. When he claimed it, he checked the items and found that nothing was missing, and the amount of silver dollars was more than double what he remembered. All items were handed over. He offered a reward, but it was firmly refused. When asked for the inspector's name, he refused to tell. The gentleman was overjoyed to have found his lost item, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the inspector's conscientious work are exemplary for modern civil servants.</p>

Min has been unemployed recently and ordered his wife to work as a prostitute to earn a living. Every night when Liu goes out to solicit customers in the street, Min follows her to watch out and prevent her from being arrested by detectives. On the 7th of this month, at about 1 AM, Liu was soliciting customers at the intersection of Moulin Street on Avenue Edward VII when she was spotted by detective Xu Wensheng, who stepped forward to arrest her. Min immediately rushed forward to obstruct the arrest. The detective arrested Min for obstructing official business.

The next day, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, explained the case, prosecuting them under Article 142 and 248 of the Criminal Code and Article 43, Section 3, of the Police Regulations for obstructing official business, offending public morals, and prostitution. Under questioning, Liu admitted that she was a prostitute last year but has stopped now. Min denied obstructing the detective's arrest. After reviewing the confession, Judge Qiu found Liu Xiuying guilty of violating the regulations and sentenced her to a fine of 5 yuan as a warning. Min Luorui was returned to custody and will be interrogated on the 12th after further investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire at the Entrance of Dongmen Road: Fire Breaks Out in the Upstairs Warehouse of the Funan Cigarette Company</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 6:05 PM, a fire suddenly broke out for unknown reasons in the warehouse on the third floor of the Funan Cigarette Exchange Shop at the entrance of Dongmen Road in the Nanshi district. Flames quickly spread and broke through the roof. Upon hearing the news, the Firefighting Association immediately sounded the alarm. Fire trucks from various districts rushed to the scene to connect water and extinguish the fire. The fire was eventually extinguished. Only a small room in the shop's warehouse was burned. The contents of the room were mainly matches, empty cigarette boxes, and soap boxes, so the loss was minimal. However, while the fire was raging, all vehicles traveling through the area and the No. 2 circular route and No. 1 streetcars of the China Merchants' Electric Tramway Company were unable to pass because the fire trucks and hoses were placed across the road, causing a complete traffic blockage. Traffic was restored after the fire was extinguished half an hour later. Afterwards, the police officer from the area took Shen Cailiang, a clerk from the shop, to the district headquarters for preliminary interrogation. Shen said that the shop owner was Weng Bingyao, from Ningbo, and that the small warehouse on the third floor was insured for approximately 5,000 taels. He said that he did not know the cause of the fire. Because the matter involved a fire, the police will secretly investigate the truth about the fire and detain Shen temporarily. Weng Bingyao will be arrested and sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Abandoning Patient in Vegetable Garden Leads to Death: Landlord's Extreme Irresponsibility</h3>
<p>Liu Wenkui, 26 years old, from Haimen, works at the Chinese Underwear Factory in Jinsitu Temple in Western Shanghai. He and his wife, Cai, 25 years old, rented a rural house at No. 108 Kangjia Bridge. The landlord, Xu, a widow, and Xu Shengquan also lived in the same house. Recently, Cai contracted typhoid fever, and her condition was severe. She developed a white rash after taking medicine, and she was extremely sensitive to the wind. Liu continued to work at the factory to earn a living. Xu and others visited Cai and saw that her condition was serious. They feared that if she died in the house, it would be unlucky and would cause trouble. Therefore, in violation of humanity, they dragged the patient to the ground in the vegetable garden behind the house. The spring weather was cold, and the wind and rain assaulted her, which acted as a death sentence. She died immediately. When Liu returned home from work in the evening, he could not find his wife. After asking, he learned what had happened and went to the vegetable garden to mourn over her body. Yesterday, he filed a complaint with the local court.</p>

<p>▲ Booming Business of Fur Garment Refrigerated Storage</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Zhigang, the manager of Tianfa Xiang Fur Shop at the Paobulu on Nanjing Road, recognizing that the weather in spring and summer is often sunny and rainy, with unstable humid and hot air, which causes more damage to furs than when they are worn, as furs inherently prefer cold and dry conditions and dislike humid and hot conditions, spared no expense to build the latest American-style fur garment refrigerated storage facility. The interior is meticulously equipped, fully filled with cold and dry air. Once fur garments enter, they are isolated from the outside world and can be permanently nourished in suitable cold and dry air, keeping their colors unchanged forever and prolonging their lifespan. Based on the principle of serving the public, the fees are particularly low, approximately a few jiao per item. For such a low price, fur garments can be properly stored, avoiding damage and theft, and can also be borrowed to facilitate economic turnover. Therefore, in recent days, important figures from the party and government and prominent figures in the business community have entrusted their furs for storage, and business is booming.</p>

<h3>Correspondence: On the Status of Accountants as Impartial Persons, Not Witnesses</h3>
<p>The accountant system in our country has been in place for only a little over a decade, and social observation has not yet fully understood it. It is often mistakenly regarded as a purely witness. Government offices sometimes have doubts about adding a commitment letter to the report. Therefore, there are examples of explanations.</p>
<p>Regarding accountants, the current regulations include 25 articles of the "Accountant Regulations" promulgated and implemented on January 25th of the 19th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1930], 8 articles of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Accountant Regulations" promulgated and implemented on September 11th of the 19th year, 12 articles of the "Accountant Review Rules" promulgated and implemented on February 18th of the 19th year, 6 chapters and 29 articles of the "Accountant Service Rules" promulgated and implemented on May 3rd of the 17th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], and 22 articles of the "Organizational Charter of the Accountant Disciplinary Committee" promulgated and implemented on December 3rd of the 19th year. All are recorded in the "Complete Collection of Current Laws and Regulations of the Republic of China" recently published by the Commercial Press. The responsibilities, status, and authority of accountants, as well as the procedures for performing duties, the types of documents to be prepared, the standards of conduct, the treatment by punitive government offices, and the regulations of uniforms, are all clearly listed in detail. If you read through them, you will have no doubts. However, since there are many national laws and regulations, it is not possible for everyone to be familiar with them. Sometimes, overlooking the examination or simply inferring based on assumptions can lead to great errors, losing the original truth. It can differ based on location, vary based on the person, have different views before and after, or suddenly arise from occasional doubts. In recent years, government offices and accountants in various places have experienced countless feelings of being unable to comply due to these doubts. Accountant associations in various places have often proposed discussions on such issues to the National Accountants Association, and accountants in various places have also frequently inquired about these issues to the Shanghai Accountants Association. Observing the main reason for their doubts, most of them mistakenly believe that the status of accountants is that of a purely witness. Because of their misunderstanding of the status, the responsibilities, authority, procedures, and formalities of performing duties are all involved in suspicion. Whether it is government offices, social stakeholders, or parties involved, they often have this kind of seemingly correct but incorrect doubt about accountants. Even accountants themselves, due to environmental reasons, may sometimes have to abandon their original clear understanding and long-standing conventions and reluctantly cope with the urgency of the environment. If this continues for a long time, they may unknowingly create a track that is not in accordance with legal principles, or even infer different tracks based on their own assumptions, which is not the original intention of the country to create an accountant system and provide social effectiveness.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned regulations, the status of an accountant is that of a purely impartial person, not a witness, which is already clearly indicated. A witness only proves the truth of the facts at the time. If the facts are like this, they say it is like this; if the facts are like that, they say it is like that, without the need for identification. Therefore, once a word is spoken, it cannot be changed, like dyeing white with black. Those who speak the truth are witnesses. Fearing falsehoods, they are disciplined by law and intimidated by commitment letters. However, the auditing of accounts by accountants, whether it is an audit report or an appraisal of accounts, is all based on their academic knowledge and theories to make an impartial judgment. Academic knowledge cannot guarantee that there will be no negligence, and theories cannot prevent new innovations. Scholars throughout the ages have researched one meaning without end, and some have written hundreds of millions of words without being able to make a decision. How can this be disciplined by law or intimidated by commitment letters? Therefore, it is said that accountants are purely in the position of impartial persons, not witnesses.</p>
<p>For example, judges rely on legal principles to adjudicate. Legal principles are the same, but opinions may differ. Legal provisions are the same, but their adoption may differ. Academic knowledge has omissions, and theories differ. Therefore, there is a three-trial system for litigation, and it is not necessary to blame the judges of the first and second trials. Auditing of accounts has an example of re-examination, but there is no regulation that the original auditing accountant should be held accountable. If accountants are regarded as fixed witnesses of society, are judges also fixed witnesses who must provide commitment letters? For example, doctors also rely on medical skills and theories to diagnose diseases, but their examination and judgment cannot guarantee that there will be no differences in theories, nor can they be disciplined by law or intimidated by commitment letters.</p>
<p>Article 24 of the "Accountant Service Rules" stipulates that if there are doubts about the matters reviewed and appraised by accountants, another accountant may be entrusted to re-examine or re-appraise them. It also states that if the re-examination or re-appraisal is different from the original examination or appraisal, the court may be requested to send the documents issued by the two accountants to the accountant association, which shall prepare an impartial written statement in accordance with Article 13 of these rules and submit it to the court. Firstly, there may be doubts. Secondly, there may be re-examination and re-appraisal. Thirdly, if there are differences between the two, it is clearly indicated that accountants use academic knowledge for appraisal and cannot guarantee that there will be no negligence, just as judges' judgments rely on legal principles but cannot guarantee that they are all correct, and doctors' diagnoses rely on medical theories but cannot guarantee that they are all the same. How can a commitment letter forcibly restrict them? This academic and theoretical judgment is purely from the perspective of scholars, standing in the position of impartial persons, without any involvement of witnesses, and there is no reason to provide a commitment letter.</p>
<p>Some may doubt that accountants' auditing and appraisal cannot avoid differences in theories and omissions in academic knowledge, so what is the value of the accountant's report? If what you say is true, the accountant's report seems insignificant. Then how can we give society a sense of trust? I do not know that accountants bear the heavy responsibility of impartiality. Even a few words or phrases carry great responsibility, and that responsibility is only the word "impartial." Omissions in academic knowledge refer to the power of identification. Differences in theoretical knowledge refer to different results of argumentation. However, the truth of the matter does not shake because of this, and the responsibility for impartiality does not disappear because of this. It is clear that the accountant's vocation is impartiality, and the accountant's position is purely that of an impartial person, who will never tarnish their vocation or lose their effectiveness because of omissions in academic knowledge or differences in theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>Then, does the responsibility for impartiality also need to be guaranteed by a commitment letter? There is no legal principle in the world for impartial persons to provide commitment letters. Those who bear the responsibility for impartiality do not need legal sanctions. According to the above-mentioned accountant regulations, all accountants should be subject to the close supervision of the competent head office and the supervisory authorities in various locations. There are strict disciplinary laws, and there are clear name registration. Although it is not necessary to provide a commitment letter in each case, the seriousness is actually greater than providing a commitment letter in each case. If it is necessary to guarantee credibility by providing a commitment letter in each case, then officials must also take an oath for each matter in addition to swearing to take office. Moreover, the matters entrusted to accountants do not necessarily all belong to the government. Those that belong to the government can provide commitment letters to the government, but for those that are privately entrusted for auditing and appraisal, to whom should the commitment letter be provided? If it is necessary to ensure impartiality and then bear responsibility by providing a commitment letter, then accountants can only be exclusively appointed by the government to be a kind of civil servant and cannot serve the general society. This principle is clear without further explanation.</p>
<p>As for today's conventions, as I said before, I dare not guarantee that they are all the same. However, examining myself, since I have been performing the duties of an accountant, I have not provided a commitment letter in any of the audit and appraisal reports, and the government office has not held me accountable for providing a commitment letter. However, there are times when there are differences in the treatment of impartial persons and witnesses, and in the treatment of notification letters and subpoenas. There are even times when the same case is regarded as an impartial person and sometimes as a witness, sometimes a notification letter is used, and sometimes a subpoena is used. Sometimes, in the capacity of a witness, in addition to inquiring about things, which seems like giving testimony, the accountant's duties are also involved, or the explanation of accounts is also involved. Furthermore, examining various places and accountants, they may not all be the same. This is what is called differing based on location, varying based on the person, having different views before and after, or suddenly arising from occasional doubts. The accountant system has not been established for a long time, and all the regulations have not been widely understood by society, so there is inevitably a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Now, because Lawyer Huang Chui has inquired the Shanghai Accountants Association about whether it is customary to add a commitment letter to the accountant's audit and appraisal, I have given this explanation. My foolish knowledge dares to correct it before my fellow accountants and sages in the world.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<h3>Another Example of Studying International Issues (1)</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance...</p>
<p>This is my second time communicating with you, please forgive me for not writing any more tedious greetings.</p>
<p>The international situation is changing rapidly, truly making it unpredictable. Like the fact that Japan and the United States cannot share common interests in the Far East, this is a current reality that everyone knows. Moreover, there are many international affairs commentators who have said that Japan and the United States will inevitably have a war in the Pacific, and the only question is the timing.</p>
<p>At that time, when I read their arguments, I also felt that they "made sense." But who knew that Japan and the United States would not only not go to war at present, but recently there has even been talk of a compromise exchange of notes. Several international affairs commentators must be breaking out in a cold sweat upon hearing this news! Because ironclad facts have overturned their conclusions. However, clever international affairs commentators will never admit defeat. They cleverly say that the economic relationship between England and the United States is even more serious than that between Japan and the United States. Therefore, if Japan can have a considerable understanding of the United States and allow the United States to get a share of the pie in the Far East, there may be a possibility of a compromise between the United States and Japan to deceive us. Therefore, I have recently become suspicious of these contradictory remarks. They can use a skillful pen to sway opinions, but we cannot blindly follow them for a long time. However, how can this problem be solved? I must ask for your guidance!</p>
<h3>(Letter from Zhao Linxiang)</h3>
<p>We have also previously presented an article on studying international issues, and then briefly discussed some principles of application in "How to Study the Northeast Problem." Recently, it is probably due to the tension in the international situation. In the reader's letters, quite a few people can apply the methods we have previously proposed to practical problems. Naturally, this is a sign of progress and is very encouraging.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Linxiang is commendable for being able to pay attention to the remarks of general commentators in this change in Japanese-American diplomacy and make comparisons before and after. We also find it not surprising that Mr. Zhao is deeply dissatisfied with their remarks because their arguments appear correct on the surface but have shortcomings. Because their use of the "observation method" is too formalized, too mechanized, and cannot examine the growth, change, and influence on the current situation of the forces of various aspects of the relationship together, processing this extremely complex and intricate relationship layer by layer and adding it to the central core of analysis. It is not impossible to take the opposition between Japan and the United States in the Pacific as the center of the analysis for studying the relationship between Japan and the United States, but what is manifested in Japanese-American diplomacy is not only a reflection of this opposition; it is more complex than this. Naturally, when studying the relationship between England and the United States, we should not forget that England and the United States stand at the main opposing poles in the capitalist system, but the reflection of the relationship between England and the United States in foreign texts is not to put on a stern face every day and shout for war. Furthermore, we should also pay attention to the fact that the relationship between Country A and Country B is not as simple as the relationship between Zhang San and Li Si, because Country A or Country B is itself a synthesis of contradictions. There are changes in class forces within a country, and there are changes in the forces of various groups within a class (referring to the bourgeoisie). For example, industrial capitalists are opposed to financial capitalists, and industrial capitalists are also opposed to agricultural capitalists. Therefore, in politics, there is the opposition of various political parties with the above-mentioned powerful people as the background (the reason for these many conflicts of interest is very simple, but it would be too lengthy to explain the reasons in detail. If readers want to study, they can send a letter explaining, and this department will answer in another letter.) These changes in forces will naturally affect a country's external economic and political combat power, which is the so-called external national policy. This national policy is a unit of international power synthesized from many contradictions, which in turn constitutes this great synthesis of international contradictions. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Despair for Puppet Organization's Participation in Far Eastern Games Performance</p>
<h3>Our Country Refutes Japan with Reason　Philippines Argues to Act According to Bylaws, Japan at a Loss for Words　Japan Proposes Postponement of This Far Eastern Games, Decision to Be Made by Philippines　Japanese Athletic Association Unreasonably Scolds Filipinos</h3>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games have fallen into a trend of indefinite postponement. The result of the informal meeting yesterday morning at the Cathay Hotel between representatives of China, Japan, and the Philippines was that China and Japan each held fast to their own opinions, not yielding in the slightest regarding the participation of the puppet organization, thus forming a deadlock with no results. Finally, the Japanese representative proposed postponing this session of the Games. Dr. Tan, the Philippine representative, also returned to the Philippines yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the Empress of Asia. Dr. Tan agreed to telegraph China and Japan in the near future regarding whether the Philippines agrees to the postponement. The Japanese representative had high hopes beforehand, believing that with the assistance of the Philippine representative, they would return victoriously. Now that the result is like this, they are greatly dissatisfied. The details of yesterday's meeting are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3>Cathay Hotel Meeting Continues</h3>
<p>Chinese, Japanese, and Philippine representatives continued to hold an informal meeting at 9:05 AM yesterday morning in Room 523 of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road to discuss the issue of the puppet organization's participation in the Far Eastern Games performance. The attending representatives were the same as the day before: Cao Yunxiang, director of the Chinese Olympic Committee, and Shen Siliang, key member of the Chinese Olympic Committee, representing China; Yamamoto, Matsuzawa, and Qian Jingmo, the consul stationed in Shanghai, representing Japan; and Dr. Tan and secretaries Zhou Jiaqi and Ms. Li, representing the Philippines. With Dr. Tan as chairman, the records from the previous day were first exchanged, amended, reviewed, and finalized, and then the debate began on the puppet organization participation issue, which has garnered global attention. The atmosphere was tense, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives insisted on their respective positions. Until 11:30 AM at noon, there were still no results, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wrangling Over Words, Attempting to Be Sophistical</h3>
<p>The focus of yesterday's meeting was on finding a possible way to resolve this issue. The Japanese representative still insisted on the precedent of India's participation in the 1930 performance, wrangling over the records of the previous session and the wording of the conference bylaws to put up a strong argument. The focus of the issue was on unanimous consent versus majority consent. The Japanese side claimed that India's participation in the 1930 performance was not agreed upon by all members, but was only proposed by the Philippines and supported by China. Therefore, the participation of the puppet organization this time only requires a proposal from Japan and support from the Philippines, and a majority can pass it, because the records at that time did not specify unanimous consent. Thereupon, the Chinese representative refuted the Japanese side's sophistry, saying that although the records did not specify unanimous passage for India's participation in the performance, they also did not specify Japan's opposition. In other words, it was unanimously passed without any doubt. The Japanese representative had no response.</p>
<h3>Exhausted Reason and Words, At Wit's End</h3>
<p>The debate between the two sides was very intense. The Japanese side especially often based its sophistry on extremely minor standpoints. However, its words were clumsy, and its reasons were non-existent, and it was repeatedly refuted by our side. Our representative even asked that, according to their intention, if the inclusion of the puppet organization has nothing to do with politics, why did they not submit it to the General Assembly themselves, and why did they have to ask your country to act as a proxy? The Japanese person was at a loss for words and reason, and the awkwardness of being at wit's end was obvious. Then the Japanese person went on to say that if China acknowledges the inclusion of the puppet organization, even if it does not actually participate, it will not be impossible. This is enough to show their desperate and ugly state.</p>
<h3>All Three Methods Overturned</h3>
<p>The two sides moved to extremes, so with overall agreement, several possible solutions were drafted. There were three methods: (1) To temporarily not discuss this issue and submit it to the General Assembly in Manila for discussion, meaning the puppet organization cannot participate in this session and its participation in the next session would be decided at the Manila General Assembly, but as a result of the vote, Japan cast a negative vote, so it did not pass. (2) To submit this issue to the Executive Committee for discussion. As a result of the vote, Japan also opposed it, because it was certain that it would be opposed by our country's committee member Wang Zhengting without a doubt. The last (3rd) method was to temporarily follow Japan's proposal to vote by majority, and immediately ask the Philippines to express its decision on whether it is possible. If the Philippines agrees, then our country would withdraw; if the Philippines opposes, then Japan would succumb or withdraw. It could be decided with a single word, but the Philippine representative opposed it, unwilling to vote for agreement or disagreement, saying that the Philippines' actions must be based on the conference bylaws and cannot be taken rashly. The three methods having been successively overturned, the meeting fell into a state of no result.</p>
<h3>Unable to Salvage, Meeting Adjourned</h3>
<p>The Philippine representative, unable to decide at this point, seeing that both sides were insisting very strongly, decided not to put it to a vote and was unable to salvage the situation, so the meeting was adjourned. Dr. Tan said in his address that since both China and Japan held their own opinions, and the conference records were incomplete (referring to the 1930 India issue), and limited by the regulations of the conference bylaws, the decision on this issue would not be put to a vote, and the Chinese and Japanese sides would be allowed to resolve it however they wish. But in the worst case, if the Far Eastern Games were to be dissolved, the Philippines is prepared to make such a sacrifice. However, what must be told to China and Japan is that the Philippines has spent tens of millions in the preparations for this Far Eastern Games, building sports fields, etc., which is quite a large amount. The last wish is that China and Japan can cooperate, as in previous sessions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Proposes Postponement of Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>The Japanese representative then stood up and proposed to the Philippine representative to postpone this session of the Games. The Philippine representative replied that this issue would have to wait until after discussions upon returning to the Philippines before it could be answered. Once the decision is made upon returning to the Philippines, China and Japan will be immediately notified by telegram. The representatives of the three countries had no different opinions. The Chinese and Japanese representatives thanked Dr. Tan, the Philippine representative, for coming all the way to Shanghai to chair the meeting, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Philippine Representative Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Philippine representative Dr. Tan, seeing the deteriorating situation of yesterday's meeting and that the opinions of China and Japan were moving to extremes, unable to be salvaged, and also because the Philippine side was in the position of host, it was difficult to express an opinion, so after the meeting ended, he took the Changxing Company's Empress of Asia ship from Shanghai at 4:00 PM in the afternoon to return to the Philippines to report the course of events to the various preparation authorities of the Far Eastern Games. Shen Siliang and others from the Chinese Olympic Committee all went to the pier to see him off. Observing the current situation, the future of the Far Eastern Games scheduled to be held in the Philippines on May 12 is difficult to predict because the Japanese side's proposal for the puppet organization to participate in the performance is affecting the future of the Games. The Games will be postponed indefinitely. It is heard that the Philippine side has already spent five million yuan on the preparations for this session of the Games.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Games Pre-Selection Continues</h3>
<p>According to Shen Siliang, although the future of the Far Eastern Games is still unknown, the various pre-selection procedures will definitely continue to be held. Today is the last day for various places to register to participate in the pre-selection. Famous athletes in this city have all registered. The pre-selection will still proceed according to the original plan. As for whether the Games will be held, we will let it take its course.</p>
<h3>Japan Bears the Blame for the Breakdown of the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>According to Shen Siliang, there are many misunderstandings among the people of the country regarding the Far Eastern Games issue. In fact, our authorities have been actively fighting at all times. Because this meeting was of an informal nature and related to international face, it was necessary to participate in the discussions. However, we were determined to deal with it with justice. If it reaches a point where it cannot be salvaged, we will naturally withdraw in order to implement our past statements. We will never dare to act arbitrarily, so as to harm the national dignity. All future matters must wait for the Philippine side to express their opinion. In short, our positions and those of Japan are moving to extremes. If the Japanese side insists on not yielding, then the Games will break down, or our country will withdraw, and the blame should be borne by the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Two Track and Field Teams Issue Declaration</h3>
<p>The Beijing Zhonghua and Shanghai Baihong track and field teams issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "To the public of the national sports community, now, a certain country instigates the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the Far Eastern Games, intending to create our country's tacit recognition of the formal existence of the puppet Manchukuo. This is using the name of sports to help its aggression. If we shamelessly stand shoulder to shoulder with the puppet Manchukuo on the field, the issue of the puppet Manchukuo, which is not recognized by the League of Nations, the countries of the world, and our national populace, will be lightly sacrificed by our sports community. Although yesterday's meeting had no results, the three methods drafted by the Philippine side were not in our favor. It is hoped that our sports community will unite and rise up so that the authorities can have a solid backing, preferring to withdraw from the Far Eastern Games rather than yield even slightly. Beijing Zhonghua Track and Field Team, Shanghai Baihong Track and Field Team, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Japan Actually Complains About the Philippines</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese newspaper Shanghai Mainichi, at the special meeting of the Second Far Eastern Games, the claims of Japan and China are still far apart. Before convening this meeting, the Philippines originally agreed with Japan's claim, but unexpectedly, its attitude changed greatly at the meeting, actually leaning towards the Chinese side. It avoided making a decision on the current issue, and did its best to delay, thereby rejecting the majority claim of the Japanese side, and agreeing with China's claim of unanimous agreement. Japan's proposal therefore failed, it is said.</p>
<h3>Official Meeting Records</h3>
<p>Far Eastern Games Standing Committee Meeting Records, exchanged, amended, reviewed, and published on April 10.</p>
<p>▲Ninth Day Records A meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the morning of the ninth at the Shanghai Shenyuan Football Field office. Attending representatives were Dr. Tan (Philippine representative and chairman), Cao Yunxiang (China), Shen Siliang (China), Yamamoto (Japan), Matsuzawa (Japan), Qian Jingmo (Japan). The five motions have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. ▲Ninth Day Afternoon Records Attending representatives and location were the same as above. The meeting was held at 2:30 PM. Informal discussion of the Manchuria participation issue The Japanese representative cited the example of India's participation in the 1930 performance, stating that the issue of Manchuria's participation in this session of the Games is of a performance nature, not joining as a member. According to Articles 3 and 10 of the conference bylaws, the Chinese representative stated that there is no need to discuss the issue of Manchuria's participation. The Japanese representative stated that the acceptance or non-acceptance of Manchuria's participation in the performance only requires passage by a majority of members, not unanimous passage. The Japanese representative stated that the case of accepting India's participation in the performance was not specially noted in the records at the time, and it is thought that it was passed by a majority, not by all. The Chinese representative stated that because there were no dissenting opinions in the General Assembly at that time, it was considered that the case was passed by the entire General Assembly. The Chinese representative stated that it did not agree with the Japanese side's opinion, and therefore proposed that it be submitted to the next General Assembly for discussion. The Philippine representative stated that the Philippines welcomes any new units to participate in the competition, but when sending a letter to Manchuria, it was stated that it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 10 of the conference bylaws. The Chinese representative stated that now the Chinese and Japanese sides each hold their own views on this issue, and there is no need to continue the discussion. The Japanese representative proposed that discussion of this issue should be given sufficient time for consideration by all parties, and that the meeting should be rescheduled. The chairman accepted the Japanese representative's proposal and asked the representatives to reconvene at the Cathay Hotel at 9:15 AM tomorrow morning. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. ▲Tenth Day Records Location: Cathay Hotel, Time: 9:15 AM. Attendees were the same as the ninth day. Chairman: Dr. Tan. The meeting was convened to amend and pass the ninth day's records, sending one copy to each country. All agreed. After informally drafting possible solutions to the Manchuria participation issue, it was discussed again. (1) To submit the issue to the next General Assembly for discussion. (2) In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the conference bylaws, to immediately submit the issue to the Executive Committee for resolution. (3) According to the Japanese side's rebuttal (participation in the performance only requires passage by a majority), to immediately ask the Philippines to give a definite indication of whether it is possible, in order to resolve the issue. Although the above three methods have undergone informal voting, there is still no satisfactory result. The chairman, observing from the attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese sides each holding their own opinions, and the provisions of Articles 3 and 10 of the conference bylaws, and the incomplete records of the India participation issue in the records, has caused the opinions between China and Japan to move to extremes. This representative (Philippines) will temporarily not vote on this issue, but will only listen to the current members to make a final solution. However, the Philippines has been preparing for this session of the Games for a long time, and of course sincerely hopes that the countries can maintain their past spirit and give the host country appropriate cooperation. The Japanese representative proposed to reschedule this session of the Far Eastern Games in order to give the countries a further opportunity to consider the issue, and to avoid the unpleasant image of having a meeting or before the meeting. The Philippine representative is willing to convey the Japanese side's proposal to the officials of the Philippine Olympic Committee, and the final decision will be telegraphed to China and Japan in the near future. The Chinese and Japanese representatives expressed their gratitude to Dr. Tan for his work as chairman of this meeting. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. ▲Appendix Translation of Far Eastern Games Bylaws The following are three articles of the Far Eastern Games Bylaws: (Article 3) Countries within the Far Eastern region may join as formal members at any time and have the qualifications of attending representatives, but must be formally approved by all members of the General Assembly. (Article 10) Competition qualifications: (A) The Far Eastern Championships are competitions for amateur athletes from the member countries of the Far Eastern Games.

(C) Each member shall be directly and fully responsible for the amateur qualifications of its representatives and shall comply with the amateur sports rules described below.

<h3>Japan Prepares　to Stop Participating in Far Eastern Games　At a Loss for Words and Reason, Scolding Filipinos Instead</h3>
<p>▲Regarding this meeting, Japan had extremely high hopes beforehand, but unexpectedly, things went against its wishes and it was at a loss. However, it still does not blame its own lack of words and reason, but instead complains about the Filipinos' lack of assistance, scolding the Philippines for not keeping its promise, which is quite strange. Now, a telegram from Tokyo says that Japan is preparing to stop participating in this session of the Far Eastern Games, which is also recorded below.</p>
<p>Emergency Board Meeting of the Japanese Athletic Association (Japan Allied Press Tokyo, 10th) The Japanese Athletic Association convened an emergency board meeting, and as a result, at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, sent a telegram to Dr. Yamamoto as follows:</p>
<p>"The meeting is hopeless, we have learned. Colleagues are extremely indignant. The reason why Japan has been striving to participate until now is to show good faith to the Philippines. The Filipinos' attitude of disregarding good faith has been made clear. Without waiting for your return to the country, regarding whether or not to participate in the Games, the board of directors believes that it is necessary to make a major decision. Please report the fact of the Filipinos' breach of faith in detail. Signed, Ping Yanting San, Vice Chairman."</p>
<p>▲Preparation to Stop Participating in the Far Eastern Games (Japan Allied Press Tokyo, 10th) The Japanese Athletic Association convened an emergency board meeting this afternoon (10th). In view of the results of the Shanghai round table meeting, the participation in the Far Eastern Games has become doubtful. Except for the athletes who should continue to train, all other preparations have been suspended. At the same time, this intention will be notified to all parties, it is said.</p>
<h3>Philippine Island Announces　Postponement, No Later Than This Year　Refusal of Puppet Country Not the Main Reason</h3>
<p>(National News Agency, Manila, 10th) It is reported that the Far Eastern Games will likely be postponed. It is rumored that it was stalled because the puppet Manchukuo's request to participate was rejected. Today, Bagga, Vice President of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association, denied this, saying that the puppet country's participation is not the main reason for the postponement. In fact, the national athlete teams are all rushed for time and unable to prepare all the procedures for attending the meeting. As for the date of the meeting, it will be announced after it is determined by the President of the Far Eastern Games, probably no later than this year, it is said.</p>
<h3>Filipinos in Philippines　All Indignant</h3>
<p>(National News Agency, Manila, 9th) The Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Manila Chinese Daily Newspaper Association held a meeting today and resolved that if the puppet Manchukuo is allowed to join the Far Eastern Games, China must refuse to participate in the Far Eastern Games. It is rumored that the puppet country has been approved to send a team to participate. If the Chinese athlete team joins the competition together with the puppet country's athletes, the Filipinos have decided not to entertain the Chinese athletes. A famous local newspaper today published a full-page editorial, stating that in today's situation, if the Chinese athlete team comes with the puppet Manchukuo athletes, then these people are directly selling out the country. The local Chinese community is paying close attention to the news of the round table meetings held in Shanghai in recent days by representatives of China, the Philippines, Japan, and the puppet. Each newspaper publishes an extra edition as soon as it gets new developments, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting　Expresses a Firm Attitude　▲Rather Withdraw▲Than Succumb</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 10th) Wang Zhengting, the chief representative of Ping to participate in the Far Eastern Games, said that Japan's proposal for the puppet organization to participate in the Far Eastern Games has no basis or reason. Because the Far Eastern Games regulations state that any new unit participating in the Far Eastern Games must be agreed upon by the other countries. If we do not recognize the issue of the puppet organization's participation, it will be difficult to become a reality. Moreover, the issue between the puppet organization countries has not been recognized and is not worth deep concern. If Japan forces its participation, we will definitely withdraw to show resistance. I will go to Shanghai on the 11th to prepare for the pre-selection.</p>
<h3>Wu Yunrui　Talks About Japan's Unreasonableness</h3>
<p>(Central, Nanjing, 10th) Wu Yunrui said that Japan's proposal at the round table meeting for the puppet organization to participate in the Far Eastern Games as a non-member, and using India's participation as an example, is unreasonable. The Northeast is our territory, which is different from India. How can the people of our country be separated from our country and participate? If the meeting has no results, we would rather withdraw and hold a sports meeting while the national athletes are in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Baseball Team Selection Decided　Assembled from the Elite of Tokyo's Six Universities</h3>
<p>(Japan Allied Press, Tokyo, 10th) The Tokyo Universities Baseball Committee considered the selection of the Japanese baseball representatives for the Far Eastern Games on the 9th. As a result, it was decided to select outstanding athletes from the six universities to form a united army as the Japanese representatives. The list of athletes is as follows: Manager Okada Genzaburo, pitchers Miyake (Keio), Kishimoto (Keio), Wakahara (Waseda), Wakabayashi (Hosei), Shioda (Rikkyo), Yamawaki (Meiji), catchers Ukai (Waseda), Sakurai (San'o), Betsui (Rikkyo), first basemen Oka (Keio), Haraguchi (Hosei), second baseman Kojima (Waseda), third baseman Sugita (Rikkyo), shortstop Katsukawa (Keio), Ozawa (Meiji), outfielders Iwamoto (Meiji), Nagakawa (Waseda), Yamashita (Keio), Yamazaki (Rikkyo), Kageura (Rikkyo).</p>

<h3>Zhou Hou Shu Discusses His Impressions of Educational Observation in Japan ㈠</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Teaching of Knowledge and Skills Mostly Aims at Foreign Expansion and Aggression Against China</p>
<p>▲ Educational Policy Has Always Consistently Emphasized Physical Fitness Training, Military Training, and Labor Production</p>
<p>I and others were sent by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to Japan to observe education. We departed from Shanghai at the end of February and returned home this time, spending a total of six weeks in Japan. We stayed in Tokyo for about three weeks and visited Yokohama, Nagoya, Bikai County, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Kobe, Beppu, Nagasaki, and other places for about three weeks. During these six weeks, we visited and inquired at educational administrative organizations, observed universities, higher education institutions, specialized schools, middle schools, normal schools, elementary schools, higher elementary vocational schools, social education organizations, social welfare organizations, factories, farms, and rural enterprise organizations, totaling more than eighty locations. The initial draft of the group observation report will be organized and completed soon, and we plan to submit it to the Provincial Department of Education. In the future, we also plan to publish it in a special volume. During our visits in Japan, we were often stimulated by the arrogance of their imperialist spirit, which we can never forget. We also hope to share this with various sectors in our country to strengthen our spirit of unity and resistance against aggression.</p>
<p>Japanese education explicitly takes loyalty to the emperor and love of country as its main purpose, but in reality, it encourages all the young citizens of the country to be brave and fierce and makes them firmly believe in aggressive nationalism. The teaching of all knowledge and skills is mostly aimed at foreign expansion, especially aggression against China. This should be something that we deeply pay attention to and strive to be vigilant about. The general young citizens have received such education, and after they grow up in the future, their ferocity of mind and viciousness of behavior towards China can be imagined. It is truly chilling. The most frightening thing is that the general principals and hosts, while making it their business to instill in their young citizens the idea of foreign aggression, all try their best to express their friendly attitude when we visit. Some even say that Japan's behavior towards China is the fault of the warlords and has nothing to do with the educational community. They are full of honeyed words and concealed daggers, and it is quite difficult to defend their claims. The Japanese educational community absolutely obeys the government, and the government is entirely controlled by the warlords. Saying that it has nothing to do with it is really incomprehensible. When the Japanese are occupying the four northeastern provinces, attempting to include my five northern provinces in their bag, and vigorously implementing economic and political aggression, their government is still deceiving the world's powers and the entire country, up and down, with the high-sounding tone of Sino-Japanese friendship. Now, looking at the words and attitudes of the educational community and even the general public, they are all in line with the government. From this, we can see their national unity and national diplomacy spirit. Recently, I have heard that various sectors in our country have successively organized Japanese visiting groups. I hope that when accepting the Japanese's courteous treatment, generous hospitality, and sweet words, do not be misled. More importantly, do not forget that they are our great enemies that we will never forget. The sweeter their words, the more suspicious their intentions are. I hope you do not neglect this.</p>
<p>The absurdity of Japan's educational purpose, viewed from the perspective of our country's broad Three Principles of the People, should not only be regarded as our great enemy but also as the world's public enemy. Although its purpose is not worth taking, there are many aspects of its implementation that are worth emulating. This is what we paid special attention to during our observation. Now, based on my personal observations, I will briefly list several of its advantages as follows:</p>
<h3>㈠ Educational Policy is Consistent From Beginning to End</h3>
<p>Japanese education values conservatism and has few changes. After Westernization, the Imperial Rescript on Education was promulgated in the 23rd year of Meiji (1890), which mainly focused on filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, trustworthiness, cultivating learning, advancing in virtue, loving the country, and being loyal to the emperor. For decades, the whole country has adhered to it without wavering. On the one hand, it takes it as its duty to educate everyone. According to its Ministry of Education, the number of literate people in the country reaches 99.51% of the total population. On the other hand, the entire educational community in the country adopts the same pace from beginning to end. Therefore, although all policies and methods are not new, they are consistent from top to bottom. Having been implemented for a long time, the effectiveness is naturally visible. Our country's educational community has never had a spirit of independence, plagiarizing from the East and the West, each acting on its own, creating new things, and being fickle. Since the implementation of new education, it has also been ten years. In terms of time, it is not later than Japan, but because the direction and policies are not uniform throughout the country and are not consistent from beginning to end, there is still nothing to be accomplished. The level of education of the people has instead declined. Therefore, if our country's education does not want to seek progress, it is fine, but if it wants to seek progress, it should implement centralization. The government should establish a simple policy that is suitable for the national conditions and order the whole country to follow it uniformly. Those who violate it should be subject to the law. Once the policy is set and the steps are unified, foreign academic thoughts can only be attached to this central idea and cannot fundamentally shake it. If this is done for a long time, the effect will be considerable.</p>
<h3>㈡ Emphasize Physical Fitness Training</h3>
<p>The emphasis on physical fitness training in Japanese schools and society is truly astonishing. The students' regular physical education is not like our country's, which is completely dominated by ball games. Ball sports are generally good, but they are not easy to popularize. Students who do not like sports often stand by and watch or escape to the self-study room to bury themselves in books. Japanese physical education emphasizes generalized sports. When we observed physical education classes in primary and secondary schools, the boys did a whole hour of stretching exercises, gymnastics, vaulting horse, rope climbing, jumping exercises, etc., without interruption. The girls did regular and artistic dance exercises. Every morning, there is an extremely orderly and vigorous morning exercise. After class, there are kendo, judo, archery, wrestling, and other wrestling sports. In the summer, there is swimming, and during vacations, there are seaside activities for the coastal groups and mountain climbing excursions for the mountain groups. Usually, teachers lead them on walking trips of dozens or hundreds of miles. In addition to emphasizing physical fitness training, schools also pay attention to nutrition and hygiene. For example, at Tokyo Municipal No. 1 Middle School, students must have lunch at school, and the school provides the necessary nutritious food for young people. This is actually neglected by the general education community and should be paid attention to. As for the promotion of various sports competitions in society, it is even more universally and enthusiastically seen everywhere. The radio broadcasts a morning exercise program at 7 a.m., so that people across the country can follow along. The rest of the time is mostly broadcasting news of competitions on the sports field. From this, it can be seen that the sports fields everywhere are full of space and time all day long, and it can also be seen that the general public likes and admires this.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Educational Observation Delegation Returns</h3>
<p>Zhou Shu (head of the delegation), principal of Yangzhou Middle School; Cao Chu, principal of Zhenjiang Normal School; Yan Liyang, principal of Xuzhou Middle School; Teng Songshi, principal of Huangdu Rural Normal School; Zhao Fengqian, curator of the Zhenjiang Mass Education Center; Liu Jian of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau; and Yu Jiwen, a teacher at Zhenjiang Normal School, of the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Observation Delegation, took the Empress of Asia from Nagasaki on April 8 and arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. After the observation was completed, they immediately returned to the Provincial Department to report their findings. Shen Shanzhi, principal of Shanghai Middle School Elementary School and principal of the Normal School Affiliated Elementary School of Sheng Lang, returned to the country one day earlier.</p>
<h3>Starting from the 23rd Year, the Central Government Will Allocate 50,000 Yuan Monthly for Pingjiao (Equal Education) Funds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) The central government cooperated with the educational funding of Beiping City. Previously, due to the depletion of the national treasury, it had been reduced. Now it has been decided that, starting from the first semester of the 23rd year, 50,000 yuan will be allocated monthly.</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Department of Education Rewards Specialist Students from This Province, 105 Yuan Each</h3>
<p>(Changsha, 10th) The Provincial Department of Education has selected 100 Hunan students specializing inside and outside the province, giving each a reward of 105 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hongying Library Actively Prepares, Trial Opening This Autumn, the Question of Building a Library Still Needs to be Considered</h3>
<p>The Hongying Library was established with funds donated by industrialist Ye Hongying to inherit the books of the Renwen Library. A preparatory office is currently set up on Avenue Joffre. It is actively preparing and plans to open on a trial basis in the autumn. The question of building a library has not yet been decided. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Trial Opening This Autumn</h3>
<p>After the library's preparatory office moved to its new address on Avenue Joffre, it was considered that the environment there was beautiful and the building was spacious, and it was planned to open on a trial basis this autumn. However, since a large part of the library's collection of historical tests and other books has not yet been cataloged, and it is difficult for the existing staff to cope with the workload, it is feared that the opening will not be possible in the autumn. Therefore, it is actively working and will try to increase personnel as much as possible to assist in the handling, hoping to open on time as scheduled.</p>
<h3>The Question of Building a Library Still Needs to be Considered</h3>
<p>The library originally planned to purchase land in a suitable location in the French Concession to build a new library building. However, since the library's fund is currently only 40 yuan, and the cost of purchasing land, building, and equipment is included, the monthly expenses have been more than 2,000 yuan. If a part of the fund is used, the remaining interest will be used to cover daily expenses, which may not be enough to allocate. Therefore, the question of building a library building still needs to be carefully considered before a decision can be made.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Drifting Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But the journey from Beijing to Fengtian was indeed too far, even the Empress Dowager herself knew she could no longer travel by imperial carriage. And she had happened to buy a "royal train" from a foreign railway company. Although she had spent an astonishing amount of money on it—this wasn't because the people at the railway company were deceiving her, but because everyone involved in the transaction wanted money, layer upon layer, until finally, the total was enough to cover the entire annual expenditure of a small country. Li Lianying, of course, also had a share; no one knows how much silver he got. But she hadn't even used it once yet. She often wondered... what it would be like to ride a train, so this time, she was determined to try it out. It was really rare for her to leave Beijing City. Taking this opportunity to go to Fengtian, she wanted to see the land she ruled; perhaps she even wanted to see a few commoners, but this was, in fact, impossible. Because ordinary commoners were not allowed to see her as a rule, and so she couldn't see them. Whenever the imperial carriage went on tour, not only were idlers not allowed to linger on the main streets, but even pedestrians on the nearby side streets were sure to be driven away. However, as my sister and I knew, whenever the Empress Dowager or the Emperor passed by on the street, there was no resident on either side who didn't poke a hole in their paper window and peek out from it; but because the imperial carriages and the red sedan chairs of the court ladies were all sealed tight, even though they were peeking from the window holes, they couldn't see so much as one of our hands or feet. I often liked to pull open my sedan chair curtain a little, so as to see the scenery outside, but I didn't dare pull it open too much, so that people outside could see me; because if I were so informal, others would greatly criticize me.

<h3>Spring and Autumn: The City in Spring</h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>Spring, a charming season. On the asphalt streets, the newly green street trees release their fresh fragrance; the trams carry patches of shade, lumbering along like drunken men, trudging forward with staggering steps.</p>
<p>The wind blowing from the Huangpu River is gentle, opening up the hearts of everyone! The girls have changed into bright and beautiful fashions, and like newborn swallows, they shyly hold the arms of their young lovers, lightly drifting into the intoxicating park. In the bright sunshine, on the soft grass, the shadows of lovers are reflected; on the red benches, in the dark green shade, the fragrance of flesh and the fragrance of powder are scattered, and amorous words are spoken. At the edge of the broad green leaves of the palm trees, the red cheeks of the girls are revealed, like bright red Flag apples in the green basins of a confectionery shop; laughter and fragrant breath boil over, and the public park of spring has returned to its golden age.</p>
<p>The faces of the people are all adorned with traces of joyous smiles, only the lonely young man, using the walking stick hung on his arm as a lover, and the old gardener who has lost his charm as a loved one, wanders in solitude on the gloomy riverbank, in the secluded thickets, looking at the rippling surface of the river, and listening to the clear singing of the orioles, like a melancholy poet.</p>
<p>When the black net of night is spread out, young men and women in the throes of springtime, as if drunk or enchanted, drill into the dance halls rippling with the light of spring! The passion of youth burns like a fire, drunk! Drunk in the embrace of the dancing girls, on the melodies of the jazz music, in the peach-colored wine glasses...</p>
<p>In the city of spring, the red makeup of the girls is even more delicate and beautiful, the tourists in the park are even more crowded, the music in the dance halls is even more intoxicating, and the pursuit of the opposite sex is even more frenzied!</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>"Saving the nation is saving yourself" - there is not a single mistake in this saying. Friend, do you not believe it? Look! Zhang San became rich from saving the nation, Li Si became a high-ranking official after shouting a few slogans... It is better not to talk about it, if I say more, your eyes will turn red!</p>
<p>Three years of graduation, a diploma in hand, cannot be exchanged for food, not even a stinking penny, the ambition to marry a concubine has disappeared, the path to promotion and wealth is difficult to find, no occupation at all, a good middle-class vagrant, alas! Woe is me! Is this the fault of studying?</p>
<p>The human world is hell, hell is heaven, otherwise, why do people who live in the human world always say that society is hell, while the dead who clearly go to hell are said to have ascended to heaven!</p>
<p>Talented men marry beautiful women, doctors marry country women, deaf men marry blind wives, high officials marry young ladies, students marry stars... Different from each other, can they become husband and wife, on the Three Lives Stone, early connected fate, hope that compatriots at home, do not divorce because of the different temperament of the lady.</p>
<p>Officials show one face to their "superiors" and another face to their "subordinates", treacherous merchants show one face to "rich people" and "young ladies", and another face to "old farmers", sons show one face to their parents, brothers, and sisters, and another face to their beloved wife and children.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 27: Hidden Grievances Dissipated by Kind Thoughts, Idle Sorrows Aroused by Drunkenness, Old Affairs Difficult to Forget</p>
<p>In the end, he said to himself, "This is also good, so I won't wander off into random thoughts from now on. I'll remember today's events, and whenever I wander off into random thoughts, I'll look at this photograph." Thinking this, he searched all over the boxes and drawers, and took out all the photos of Zhao Ziqiang himself, whether new or old, half-body or full-body. Now, it wasn't just that the photos were hung on the walls; the edges of the dressing table, the edges of the writing desk, inside the glass cabinet, the edges of the bed, and the foot of the bed all had a photo. If he was sitting in the room thinking things over, he could look up and see his husband. Then, in good conscience, he wouldn't be embarrassed to think of his lover again. He was in the room, possessed by the devil, thinking wildly for a while, and busying himself for a while, making quite a stir for half the morning. It wasn't until lunchtime when Zhao Weng was calling for dinner in the hall that he calmed down. He replied, "Father, please eat, I don't want to eat yet." Zhao Weng said, "This is not right. Young fellows often don't eat, it's not as good as us old men, who have three big bowls every meal." Guizhi said, "Father, please eat, my eyes are a little sore." Zhao Weng said, "You have to eat a little, if you don't eat, where will the energy come from? The pain will be even harder to resist." As he said this, he stood at the door waiting. Guizhi thought, "Father is white-haired and old, and he has to stand outside the door serving the young to eat. My conscience is too uneasy," so he quickly found a pair of glasses that Ziqiang had left at home in the box, put them on his nose, and then walked out with a smile. Zhao Weng didn't suspect anything else. At dinner, seeing that there was a bowl of mutton stew with cabbage, a bowl of northern tofu cooked with greens, and a bowl of flour noodles, he said, "Mutton is good for replenishment, and these two dishes are light. Don't rush to eat, I'll boil two eggs for you." To speed things up, he got up to get the eggs. (359)</p>
<h3>Return to the Village Movement</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>"Revitalize the countryside, go to the countryside," has become a timely slogan... China, whose national foundation is built on the countryside, is even more faced with the bankruptcy of the countryside. At a time when the national situation is in danger, it is generally regarded as a panacea for "revival." Therefore, people in the cities are all promoting the return to the countryside movement. Good, let's see them return to the countryside, with cameras, setting up "Kodaks", taking "sticks", Western clothes, leather shoes; the real villagers see them and say that the foreign gentlemen have arrived.</p>
<h3>Jade Butterfly Score, Butterfly Stars in Sisters</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>A thousand lives taste bitter, suppressing tears, newly separated from the humble door. Bamboo horses and green plums, the traces of childhood still remain. Despite the boredom, the bright curtains are exhausted, and one should be saddened by the mountain city and fishing villages. In the twilight, the pampered child begs for milk, and old songs are replayed. Let us not speak of the separation between clouds and mud, sad intestines miss the distance, laughing,承恩. Since both are luxurious, how can one follow the weeping marks on the opposite side? It is easy to hurt the spirit, a sudden rain between flowers, thinking of the past, an empty cup under the moon. Around the Lin Garden. In the spring, the phoenix son comes, to awaken the fragrant soul.</p>
<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Four Kinds of Snacks</h3>
<p>— Shang Zhen</p>
<p>"Life is all about eating," and besides, our country's culinary art is world-renowned, how can we not enjoy the blessings of the palate? However, bear paws and camel humps are not something ordinary people can afford. I've only heard of these two delicacies but never seen them. Let's just make some small snacks!</p>
<p>Kumquat Cakes: Select high-quality kumquats that are as plump as honey dates. Use a small knife to make incisions around the kumquat, with the distance between each cut about the length of a grain of rice. Too wide, and the seeds won't come out; too narrow, and it will break easily. After incising, squeeze out each seed, making the kumquat resemble a double-layered chrysanthemum, but be careful not to break it. Immediately put them in a clay pot with water and simmer over charcoal. When they're half-cooked, add white sugar, about twelve ounces of sugar for every pound of kumquats. Adding sugar will greatly increase the heat, so you must stir constantly, pressing each kumquat flat. Simmer until the kumquats turn from hard to soft and appear transparent, then immediately remove the pot from the heat. If the heat is too high, they will not only burn but also become stiff. Then, carefully pick out the translucent ones and place them in a glass jar, resembling golden flowers. When eaten, they are not only delicious and fragrant but also good for the stomach and spleen!</p>
<p>Magnolia Petals: Magnolias bloom in mid-spring, covering the trees in white. Pick the half-open ones, using only the middle layer of petals, as the outer layer is older and the inner part is bitter. Gently wash them with clean water; if they turn yellow from too much washing, they are no longer usable. Separately, mix glutinous rice flour (or fermented rice flour, though it tends to be a bit hard) with water and white sugar and set aside. Heat oil in a pot until boiling (the type of oil doesn't matter). Lightly clamp a petal with chopsticks, dip it fully in the flour mixture, and drop it into the pot. The heat should be gentle. When the edges appear slightly browned, remove them immediately. The magnolia petals are now ready. They taste fragrant, sweet, and crispy, leaving a pleasant lingering aroma in your mouth.</p>
<p>Rose Petal Jam: Place slightly ripe, not yet yellow, high-quality plums in a clay pot with some clean water. Simmer over charcoal until cooked through. Strain off the plum soup, as it will be too sour. Then, use chopsticks to remove the skin and pits and set them aside. Separately, prepare half-open rose blossoms. Remove the petals and discard the core. Mash the petals and squeeze out the juice. Then, combine them with white sugar (the amount of sugar should be about twice the weight of the plums; more flowers will result in a richer color) and mash together with the plum sauce from before and put into the pot. Simmer over charcoal until ready. The jam will have a bright color, strong fragrance, and fresh taste. Store it in a porcelain container for consumption at any time. You can also use salted plums, cleaned and combined with dried rose petals, but the results will be inferior in all aspects.</p>
<p>Purple Perilla Plums: Plums that are too small are tasteless, and those that are too ripe are not crispy. Therefore, use plump and crispy ones. Lightly crush them without removing the pits. Remove the old leaves or stems from the purple perilla that grows alongside the plums. Mix it with white sugar, using twice the weight of the plums. No need to simmer. Place them in a container and sun-dry for three to five days in the summer, turning them two or three times a day. Once the plum flesh has been dyed purple, they are ready to be chewed. They have a fragrant aroma, and their taste is far superior to the green plums sold in the market. The purple perilla is also delicious and has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>The above four items are snacks that the author's family often enjoys. They don't cost much, are hygienic, and have good color, aroma, and taste. I dare to offer them to the readers and ask the mistresses of the household, or those preparing to be, to try them out. If you only buy imported crackers or jams and give up the happiness of enjoying "national flavors," it is truly not worth it! Ah! How clean the air is, how refreshing to breathe! Those mountain views and waterscapes, fragrant flowers, and lush greenery are so much fun! The beauty of the scenery cannot be compared to even a fraction of what you can find in the dark and sunless city. Thus, one villa to the east, one mansion to the west, houses that blend Chinese and Western styles, are quickly being built.</p>
<p>Ah! After all, the countryside is dry and tasteless... Those clumsy, unkempt country bumpkins are really a bit annoying. It's hard to get a rickshaw, and my legs are killing me. The so-called entertainment is just a tea garden with incomplete doors and windows. "Damn it, let's go to the city!"</p>
<p>Oh! Those rental notices for the new houses are posted so big!</p>
<p>But, it's still so bustling...</p>
<p>"Revitalize the countryside!</p>
<p>Return to the countryside!"</p>

<h3>Observations on "Ghost Writing"</h3>
<p>— Wu Lou</p>
<p>There are many ghosts lurking in the literary world. Looking at it for a long time, one's physical eyes can transform into divine eyes. The beauty or ugliness of an article should be known at a glance. Like a skilled card player who knows what kind of card it is as soon as they touch it, experience creates a special feeling. The wonder of the divine eye is that one can casually sense what kind of person probably wrote a certain article, or what kind of article someone should write, as if seeing their liver and lungs.</p>
<p>The marvel is that one must first slightly distinguish between human and ghost. Some grand and majestic theories are ghost writings, while some that are not eye-catching are actually human writings. There are ghost writings that have not fully transformed into ghosts, and there are human writings that have already become ghostly. Among ghost writings, there are ghost writings with great supernatural powers, ghost writings with insufficient supernatural powers, and even honest little ghosts' ghost writings... and so on.</p>
<p>The era of telegraph seems to have passed. It's a pity that the death of a "Jiao Hanxiang" led to no more echoes. Some gentlemen cannot shake their heads and sway, and they are unhappy! That can be considered the most supernatural ghost writing. Then there was the era of declarations, the era of speeches, "Dear compatriots..." and other great works, which were still ghost writings. In addition, there are many social novels, which are even more like sketching shadows and are masterpieces in the ghost realm!</p>
<p>Anyone who has studied "logic" a little must know that there are many seemingly reasonable arguments that are actually based on wrong premises, or resounding articles that are far from the truth. For example, "To save the country, you must drink boiled water!" or "Great people must first gnaw on vegetable roots." These can only be classified as ghost talk, and there is no way to criticize them. Next are those that flash and sparkle, like magic tricks, with a wide variety of arguments, covering everything from ancient to modern, "Fried dough sticks and sesame cakes!" "National affairs are like playing chess!" Without a clear mind and sharp analysis, one will be confused by them. As for those who are twisted and affected, learning some slick and deceitful ways, making every effort to be cunning, and unable to justify themselves, these are the lowest of the low.</p>
<p>Those who are about to betray, their words are ashamed; those who are suspicious in their hearts, their words are rambling; the words of good people are few; the words of rash people are many; the words of those who slander good people are roving; the words of those who lose their integrity are submissive... The ancients also deeply understood how to read articles and listen to speeches. Many young people do not know the ways of the world, but they also know how to read articles, judge truth and falsehood, and distinguish between human and ghost. Where does that feeling come from? Could it be the light of a pure soul that can illuminate ghosts? In that case, where can all the deceivers and name-stealers of the past and present escape to?</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Trip to Malaya</h3>
<p>— Yue Ming</p>
<p>Traveling in a foreign country always seems to easily evoke foreign sentiments, but that was not the case on the train in the Federated Malay States. Almost all I saw along the way were Chinese compatriots, except for a few Malay ticket inspectors. Inside the carriage, upon entering, one sees the Chinese characters "Beware of Pickpockets." Arriving at a station, turning my head to look out the window, amidst the shoulders of the passengers, there was a sign with the place name in both Chinese and English. The rural thatched houses along the way were immediately eye-catching, but what stood out the most were the two strips of earthy red Spring Festival couplets pasted on the doors. The streets of the towns also flew by with many fabric signs covered in square characters.</p>
<p>"The prosperity of Malaya must be attributed to the Chinese!" I don't know whether I saw this sentence in some travelogue or in an essay in a Chinese newspaper. I had forgotten it completely, but now it re-entered my mind. I was sitting by the window, greedily taking in the Malay wilderness sleeping under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>The Malay wilderness under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>The person sitting next to me was noisily talking about business, and I occasionally heard a few despondent and resentful words.</p>
<p>"In the past, one could sell for one or two hundred dollars, but now, damn it, it's only worth ten or twenty dollars!"</p>
<p>I knew they were talking about rubber. Many people made fortunes from it during the European war. Now, with the world's economic panic, rubber prices have fallen sharply, and complaints are inevitable.</p>
<p>Almost all the mountains and fields along the way were man-made rubber forests, but some places showed an undisguised desolation. The people who collect the rubber sap were nowhere to be seen, and deep weeds grew at the foot of the trees. Occasionally, one could see ten miles of forest that had been burned bare, with charred tree trunks lying everywhere, like a battlefield. If some severed limbs were added, the distant traveler looking out the window would not be able to help but feel a sense of elegy, right? The train passed Kuala Lumpur, and a large group of Chinese compatriots got on, carrying simple luggage, saying they were going back to Guangdong. Their unclean clothes and melancholy faces surrounded me, reminding me of the ancient saying "return to one's hometown in wealth and honor," and my heart became as sad as theirs.</p>
<p>Your hands once prospered Malaya;</p>
<p>Your blood once fattened Malaya;</p>
<p>Now Malaya is weak and withered,</p>
<p>Go back, don't be nostalgic, don't be sad!</p>
<p>However, as the train rushed on into the night, when it reached Tank Road Station, the dancing Singapore, the singing Singapore, the drunken Singapore, surrounded me for a while and dazed me. I thought quietly;</p>
<p>"Malaya is still prosperous! I don't want to go back!"</p>
<p>But soon, like those compatriots, I returned to my country in sorrow. This was in the spring of 1931.</p>
<h3>A Room Without Windows</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>I moved down, I moved down from that skyscraper made of stone, like an oriole leaving a tall tree, settling down in a bottomless valley.</p>
<p>In the high-rise, my heart couldn't bask in the sun. Looking at the sea waves, I slapped my suffocating chest,</p>
<p>A ghostly figure was nailed to my side, never letting go day or night. I closed this door, and the four walls all leaked radiance. A pair of black hands strangled the world, and here I breathe freely.</p>
<h3>Inside and Outside the Bathroom (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jia Ming</p>
<p>"No, what do you mean..."</p>
<p>"I mean, let's go have some tea and snacks. Don't you have anything else to do?"</p>
<p>After taking a shower, I usually feel hungry. I agreed.</p>
<p>In the thick mist, I watched his plump back and plump legs disappear outside the bathroom door.</p>
<p>I gradually increased the warm water to the hottest temperature, showering it on my chest and back. I scrubbed the layers of my skin with force. When the heat became unbearable, I turned off the hot water and let the coldest water shower all over my body. After scrubbing thoroughly again, I slightly wiped myself with the small towel I had brought in and walked outside in my straw sandals.</p>
<p>I carefully looked for my friend and waited until a man in gray shorts standing in front of the mirror shouted loudly "Mr. Lu" to me before I recognized him.</p>
<p>He was combing his hair in front of the mirror, saying bits and pieces of things to me. He was wearing a gray short-sleeved shirt and shorts, and a pair of black cloth shoes.</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt a little scared. I looked closely at his face, that pair of thick eyebrows, the corners of his eyebrows seeming to reveal a fierce light, the short beard below, clearly hiding a cunning smile, a pair of small eyes, constantly sizing me up, as if with ill intentions. Just looking at his attire, he didn't seem like a good person at all.</p>
<p>I immediately regretted making the mistake of getting to know this friend. I remembered the story he had just told about the waiter stealing the guest's wallet, and I became even more flustered. I was afraid that this was a plan to attack from the east and strike from the west. I quietly felt my pockets while getting dressed and felt a little relieved when I found the fifty dollars was still there.</p>
<p>He was waiting next to me while I got dressed. I kept responding to him, but in my mind I was calculating how to find a way to get rid of him. He invited me to have tea together, and I thought this must be a trap.</p>
<p>After I finished dressing, we came out together. I pretended to need to tell my family, so I used the phone in the office to make a call.</p>
<p>I didn't dial the correct number. I held the phone, said questions and answers myself, pretending to listen, and then pretended to be surprised. Then I put down the receiver and told the person standing next to me that there was something important going on at my house, that I had to go back immediately, and I expressed my apologies for not being able to have tea with him.</p>
<p>I didn't hear clearly what he said in response. I quickly walked out onto the street, like a captured prisoner who had escaped. I immediately jumped into a rickshaw, pointed in the opposite direction from my house, and urged the rickshaw puller to hurry up and pull me away.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Peiping (7) Night at the Crossroads</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>The market in Peiping closes much earlier than in Shanghai. Not to mention midwinter; even now that the weather is gradually warming up, the market still closes very early. For example, Wangfujing Street and the Dong'an Market area can be considered one of the most bustling areas in Peiping, but after nine or ten o'clock at night, it becomes deserted and sleeps in the curtain of night.</p>
<p>At this time, the crossroads outside Dong'an Market are only left with a few scattered passersby, a few rickshaws lazily waiting there. A few will-o'-the-wisp-like lights illuminate the food stalls – pancakes, pig's head meat, corn bread... faintly tempting the rickshaw pullers' appetite.</p>
<p>"Clang!" Four large copper coins fell from a skinny black hand onto a small stall. The stall owner quickly handed a "corn bread" to this black palm, which immediately went to a disheveled mouth with a short beard. "How about trying a piece of pig's head meat that was cooked today?"</p>
<p>"...Hai!" The short-bearded mouth swallowed the corn bread and began to speak. "...Don't mention it! After pulling all night, I only earned twenty coins (Note 1). How can that be enough to eat meat?"</p>
<p>"Eat first, we can settle up later. Isn't the Zhenguang Cinema about to close?" The stall owner casually handed over a piece of oily pig's head meat.</p>
<p>Dozens of cars and private cars were parked in front of the Zhenguang Cinema. There was still no movement at this time; their masters were still appreciating Greta Garbo's kissing poses, or drinking in Yang Xiaolou's "Picking the Curtain" at the Jixiang Theater to the west.</p>
<p>The pig's head meat had already entered his stomach, and his legs had to turn towards the entrance of Zhenguang Cinema to wait. After waiting for an hour with great difficulty, the movie finally ended, and men and women poured out from the door. Laughter, shouts, car horns, rickshaw pullers' throats – a chaotic symphony broke the dead air. But the people watching the movie were not crowded, and they all dispersed in a moment; the lively noise disappeared like light smoke, and the surrounding air blackly solidified into a团.</p>
<p>"Pao la!" (Note 2) A rough sound came from the short-bearded mouth. The black, thin hand listlessly dragged the rickshaw pole and turned back to the stall. "Pao la!"</p>
<p>"Wait for the Jixiang Theater to close." The stall owner's face showed a sympathetic bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Someone did hire me, but I didn't get the fare," the short-bearded man said, shaking his head. "To Baoguo Temple – such a long way – they only offered thirty coins! I said I don't want even a dime! Damn it! Pao la!"</p>
<p>The wind gradually picked up, carrying dust and cold, raging wildly at the crossroads. Jixiang Theater closed! Another burst of noise slowly subsided again. Seeing that the crowd was about to disperse, the short-bearded man still hadn't found an employer. "Pao la!" His heart was filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>"Rickshaw!" A person who came out last shouted. "Baoguo Temple."</p>
<p>"Two dimes."</p>
<p>"Twenty coins." As he spoke, the person only cared about walking west.</p>
<p>"One dime... Sir... It's twelve or thirteen miles..."</p>
<p>"Twenty-four coins." The person walked away. "Do you want forty coins?"</p>
<p>"Twenty-six coins."</p>
<p>"Pao la!" The rickshaw puller stared at the empty street, biting his teeth. Suddenly, he chased after him, shouting breathlessly... "I'll pull you for twenty-six coins!"</p>
<p>He pulled this twenty-six-coin employer, ran past the small stall where he had borrowed pig's head meat, and greeted the stall owner... "I'll give it to you tomorrow!" A few minutes later, the sound of his heavy footsteps faded away.</p>
<p>The night was deep. The crossroads were as silent as death.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Twenty coins are ten large copper coins, equivalent to four cents of silver.</p>
<p>(Note 2) "Pao la!" is Peiping rickshaw pullers' "slang," meaning similar to "it's over," or the Shanghai people's "dismantling the Old Immortal."</p>
<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Min</p>
<p>The thin, old horse,</p>
<p>Carrying heavy luggage!</p>
<p>The man is on a journey.</p>
<p>The long whip urging the horse,</p>
<p>Tore through the dusk,</p>
<p>Drawing a faint trace of a new moon.</p>
<p>The swaying willow branches by the roadside,</p>
<p>Stir up the traveler's troubles;</p>
<p>Adding to the homesickness.</p>
<p>Looking at the drifting white clouds, who can know when they will return?</p>
<p>Thinking only increases sadness!</p>
<p>Let the evening wind blow</p>
<p>The thin clothes,</p>
<p>The weary traveler enters the deserted village.</p>
<p>"The fire is about to burn your eyebrows!"</p>
<h3>Half a Day's Lessons (8)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>I get angry whenever I think about this national anthem, saying that the 30 million people in the Northeast have "no suffering, no worries," and "no grievances." That can only deceive ghosts! Facts are the best eloquence. The 30 million people in the Northeast will not fall for your tricks and will not be anesthetized by you!</p>
<p>Next were speeches by many dignitaries, nothing more than deceitful nonsense. Then, amidst enthusiastic applause, the Japanese consul stood up to speak...</p>
<p>"I am honored to be able to participate in your country's grand event today! The reason is that these two anniversaries are very rare and have great significance in history.</p>
<p>"First, let's talk about September 18th. September 18th can be said to be the day when the Japanese Empire helped your country establish its foundation. The Empire has a relationship with Manchuria and Mongolia, being of the same culture and race, sharing the same fate, so it bravely withdrew from the League of Nations, regardless of other countries' complaints and accusations. Since the Empire initiated the establishment of your country, it must naturally recognize it afterward. Therefore, on this day last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a document to your country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, officially recognizing it. This is the origin of September 15th. When your people celebrate this grand event, they should remember the righteous act of the Empire in establishing your country. The two countries, Japan and Manchuria, must reach the stage of 'Japanese-Manchurian cooperation, co-existence, and co-prosperity'..."</p>
<p>After the speech, the Japanese elementary school students under the stage clapped and waved flags frantically. He calmly walked down the stage.</p>
<p>I don't know what others thought, but as for myself, I felt a chill and then a heat all over my body while listening to this speech. I had no other hope. I only hoped that I would suddenly turn into a bomb, causing everyone in the hall, both enemies and ourselves, to perish together!</p>
<p>I didn't know what other people were saying on the podium. I was too excited, I was too angry. But suddenly, a rumbling sound rang above my head. Two Japanese planes scattered a large number of leaflets from the sky. The crowd stirred, vying to pick up the falling pieces of paper. I grabbed one by the way, entitled "New Manchuria."</p>
<p>It was another long piece of sickening, deceptive talk.</p>
<p>The originally dull meeting place, due to the temporary commotion, seemed a bit more active. No, it would be better to say more scattered. In the student ranks, some were sitting on the ground, and some even tore off the small national flags and leaflets to wipe their snot. From their impatient looks, you could tell that everyone was hoping that this farce would end quickly so they could vent the depression in their chests.</p>

<h3>Finance  Gold Market Calm │Still Hovering Around 950 Yuan│</h3>
<p>The gold market was extremely calm yesterday. The overall trend for the day hovered around 50 yuan. However, the result seemed firm. The swap period was near, and the margin was sufficient. Thus, the fluctuations were narrow. Initially, the overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US saw increases. The Shanghai Gold Exchange saw the price of silver futures rise by anywhere from 2.2% to 3.5%. Exchange rate fluctuations were minor. London spot gold fell by three pence, US cotton fell by eleven points, and US wheat fell by 12.5 points. The opening price was slightly lower, around 50 yuan, but it quickly fell back to 49 yuan, and the trend was quite stable. Then, due to the difficulty in settling the May US dollar at 35.1875 yuan, it was slightly stable. Although the Dalian group was willing to offer after the opening, the banks had a strong appetite for intake. The domestic market trended tighter, and the gold market was also firm. Later, due to interbank swap transactions, both the exchange rate market and the gold market were calm. After entering the market, although the Central Bank opened spot auctions from time to time, the exchange rate market hardened instead, once falling below the 50 yuan mark. The noon close was still calm, and there were still many buyers taking advantage of the low prices. The foreign news lacked impact. Although the night silver price in Seattle rose by more than ten points, it was not significant. As a result, the market was flat and weak after opening. The banks' appetite was to offer close to the sell price and buy far from the sell price. Interbank swaps were common. The gold market was silent, and the trend was mediocre. Finally, the domestic market tightened, and it rebounded at the end. The red gold price was 962 yuan. The market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 949.5 yuan, down 1.13 yuan from the previous close. The spot opening was 9.4 yuan. The exchange rate market opened with recent asking prices: British pound at one shilling four pence 1875 and US dollar at 35 yuan. Although the Dalian group was willing to supply August US dollars at 625 and May at 1875, the banks had a strong appetite. Banque Belge pour l'Étranger took August US dollars at 625, and McAlister and others continued to take the same month at 5625. The Dalian group, as well as Heng Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Chang Yi, Da Yong Zhi Feng Yong, etc., all entered the market. It rose from 9 yuan to 51 yuan. Da Fa, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Da De Cheng, and Heng Yu sold off, and it fell back to 0.1 yuan. The Central Bank opened spot sales, Ying Feng, Heng Heng Xing entered, and it rose again to 0.08 yuan. After entering the market, the exchange rate market was calm. The banks bought far and sold near, engaging in swap transactions. The gold market was also flat. Then, people were slightly fearful. Although the Central Bank tried to enter the spot market strongly, the domestic market loosened instead. Du Yi offered July US dollars at 4375, McAlister offered June at 3125, and Yi Da Yong, Heng Yu, etc., sold off, and it fell to 49.4 yuan (once quoted at 9.3 yuan). Heng Xing limited purchases and stabilized. Ying Feng Heng still had purchases. Hong Li Fu Yu and others rushed to buy at low prices and gradually rebounded to 50.06 yuan.

Yu Qing Yong Chang, Sheng Yong, Ying Feng Heng, Da De Cheng, and Da Xing Yong Shun Li all purchased together, and it rose to 2.7 yuan. Tong Chun took the opportunity to sell and fell slightly. The closing price was 952.5 yuan, and the spot price was the same. Although Bing Xing and Da Xing Yong came out after the market closed, it was still stable. The highest price of the day was 952.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 949 yuan, a fluctuation of 3.7 yuan. As a result, it rose by 1.7 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 34.5 yuan because the HSBC US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged, which translated into a gold price of a little less than 1003 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was discounted by about 50 yuan, less than 2 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 951 yuan, and for May it was 950 yuan. The morning make-up price was 951 yuan, and the afternoon make-up price was 954 yuan. The red gold price was 962 yuan. The market for refined red gold was still calm. In the market, Tai Kang Run sold 70 taels to the silver shops, adding 18 yuan, which was 99.5% purity. The Tianjin group sold 350 taels to Tong Feng Yong, adding 13.25 yuan. Ying Feng Heng also sold at this price. After entering the market, the Central Bank's spot sales were relatively slow. Ying Feng Heng sold to the Tianjin group, adding 13.1 yuan. There were many interbank transactions in the Tianjin group, and it once reached 13 yuan. In addition, East goods were priced at 11.75 yuan and 11.5 yuan. The industry took in a lot, as 3,000 to 4,000 taels of East goods poured in. The Central Bank opened about 500 lots of spot sales, priced about 1.5 yuan higher than the futures, ranging from 951 yuan to 952.5 yuan, handled by Ying Feng Heng, Tong Feng Yong, Tai Kang Run, Da De Cheng, etc. Yesterday, Yong Feng released seven lots, which were taken in by Ying Feng Heng.

<h3>Wire Transfers Suspected of Flooding In, Market Sentiment Especially Rampant</h3>
<p>Recently, all parties in Shanghai have been quite busy with the import and export of various goods.

Yesterday, a large number of wire transfers suddenly arrived in Shanghai from both domestic and foreign sources, totaling about 2 million yuan from foreign sources and more than 1 million yuan from domestic sources. As a result, funds were abundant, and the flow of goods became smooth. However, the financial sector became increasingly saturated, so the foreign call loan rate changed again to a small two points, which is three points. The morning and afternoon markets were the same. The clearing balance was still white. There were also a large number of call loan transactions.

<h3>Securities Bond Market Restores Clear Air  Individual Investors Profit and Cover Short Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, April 10, the rumors in the public debt market gradually subsided, and the atmosphere of popularity returned. Because most individual investors saw that there was profit to be made, they rushed to enter the market. Therefore, at the beginning of the morning market, except for the 1918 Customs and Demobilization bonds, which continued to fall, the market gradually rebounded after the demobilization bonds. However, it was heard that a certain bank was selling off, but the northern traders stopped selling, and individual investors rushed to enter the market very quickly, which gave the bulls an opportunity. During the market session, the market price was counted to rise by several cents to more than one yuan. There were not many large transactions in the morning session, and various bonds rose and fell differently. The price fluctuations were very small. In the afternoon session, only one transaction was made, but the trading was not bad. Among the bonds in the earlier session, the 1919 Customs and 1919 Charity bonds did not change much, but after the bond roll, individual investors greatly supplemented their positions, and the 75 bond had a large amount of absorption. The market rose again, and prices increased by about half a yuan. As a result, the 1918 and 1919 bonds rose little compared to the previous day, while the rest rose by 0.57 cents to 1.78 yuan. Among them, the trend of gold short-term bonds and the Sixth New Customs Tax was the best. The changes in each bond are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Silver, Copper, and Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report by the Xin Feng Foreign Firm yesterday, the New York stock market was still sluggish. In the end, due to general expectations of silver legislation and increased demand for copper, silver and copper prices rose, and silver and copper stocks also rebounded. Moreover, steel production was good, and the market gradually turned firm. The small exchange was sluggish, and the rest were slightly loose except for steel stocks. Bonds rose to new high prices. There were scattered settlements of US government bonds. German government bonds turned firm due to Xiao Qi's reconciliation attitude. According to a report by the firm's agent, the (securities) fluctuations were subtle, and the public lacked interest. (Wheat) The market was stagnant, and Washington's news was the key. In terms of position, it was beneficial to purchase. (Cotton) The drafter of the Punk Hai case claimed that the case was expected to pass in the original way. Expansionists were abnormally excited about the activities of the Dice Silver Case and other currency legislations. The trend of selling off in the May period reduced the difference. Spot demand was slightly better, and the foothold was firm. The market was waiting for developments from all parties. The total transaction volume for the day was 850,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>

<h3>Spun Yarn of This Month Reveals New Low Price</h3>
<p>The spun yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the spot yarn sales market turned dull again. The Yunnan traders also stopped purchasing. However, in the futures yarn market, prices had fallen for two consecutive days, prompting profit-takers to cover their short positions, causing the market to rebound. However, the environment was still poor, and there was still no solution for the old standard yarn this month. New low peaks were discovered every day, and the factories were helpless, indicating the decline of the market.</p>
<h3>There are Short Covering Traders in Forward Spun Yarn</h3>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market fell by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 cents in each month due to the falling of foreign cotton and the lack of buyers. In the afternoon, short sellers covered their positions for profit, rising by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,600 bales. The sell-offs were Da Chang 700 bales, Da Chang Cheng 900 bales, Shen Ji 700 bales, Ren Feng 750 bales, Yu Da 650 bales, Hui Kang 600 bales, Geng Feng 600 bales, and Yuan De 750 bales. The purchases were Da Feng 1,050 bales, Chun Ji 800 bales, Yi Cheng 600 bales, Yi Yu 50 bales, Geng Feng 8 bales, Bai Ming Hua 500 bales, and Tong Xing 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Standard Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Balance |</p>
<p>|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|</p>
<p>| April       | 167.0        | 166.7       | 167.0       | Down 0.40 | 44,100 |</p>

<h3>Yunnan Traders Stop Purchasing Spot Yarn</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn were less than yesterday. The total purchase volume of each trader for the day was 550 bales, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan. The purchase amount of each trader is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 140 bales Sichuan: 20 bales Shantou: 30 bales Xiamen: 3</p>
<p>Guangdong: 105 bales Wuhu: 20 bales Henan: 80 bales Yunnan: 140 bales</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton in Fluctuation</h3>
<p>The cotton market started by falling and then rising, but the Indian and American cotton markets unanimously trended downward, so the situation was weaker. However, the sellers bought back short positions when the prices fell, so the market rose again in the afternoon. The spot cotton consumption in the market was lacking. The factories had no way out for spun yarn and were stopping work, so the future of the cotton market was still difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Cotton Rebounded After the Low Price</h3>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market was affected by poor foreign cotton conditions, and the price fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan in each month. In the afternoon, short sellers covered their positions, and the price rebounded by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 79,600 dan. The sell-offs were De Ji 5,300 dan, Yuan Da 3,100 dan, Yi Cheng 1,800 dan, Chang Feng 2,000 dan, Tong Xing 2,800 dan, Da Fu 2,100 dan, Geng Feng 2,600 dan, Hui Kang 2,900 dan, and Tong Ji 2,400 dan. The purchases were Ming De 3,900 dan, Chun Ji 80 dan, Yu Kang 2,400 dan, Yuan Da 2,100 dan, Jin Chang 2,600 dan, Chang He 4,900 dan, and Yi Yu 1,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Standard Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Balance |</p>

<h3>Raw Cotton Factory Demand Sluggish</h3>
<p>The raw cotton business was unusually quiet. The factories' intention to purchase was sluggish. Due to the falling price of spun yarn, they did not deal with high-priced raw materials. The sources were Tongzhou cotton 250 bales, Yao cotton 350 bales, Lingxian cotton 46.75. The Da Factory took in 83 pieces of spot goods for the factory.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Fell Again by More Than Ten Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was sluggish and lacked features. The industry's attitude was to wait and see. The market fell due to foreign firms selling and bulls settling. The spot price fell by ten points, and the futures price fell by nine points to twelve points. The spot price of Wuwu [typographical error] cotton fell by points, and the futures price fell by four points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton fell by one point. The Bombay cotton market fell due to speculators selling and bulls settling. As a result, both plain and spicy [cotton] rose by 0.25 yuan, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 1 rupee and 0.25 yuan. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 9th):</p>

<h3>Market Situation in Tianjin Spun Yarn and Cotton is Bland</h3>
<p>The Tianjin market situation for spun yarn is bland, and the buyers are waiting and seeing. The Botou traders bought 15 bales of 16-count Changshou yarn at a price of 174 yuan. Another 10 bales of 16-count Sanji yarn were priced at 171 yuan (including taxes). The Dishi traders bought 10 bales of 16-count Samsung yarn at 162 yuan (taxes to be added separately). In addition, the market situation for Xihua cotton is reported to be that good goods are still stable, and inferior goods are slightly flat. There is still no major turnaround in the sales market. Foreign merchants bought 298 bales, with an opening price of 40.07 yuan, and another 120 bales, with an opening price of 40.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food Grains</h3>
<h3>Bull Traders in Futures Flour Sold Off a Lot</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month generally showed a flat and sluggish trend. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago had mixed ups and downs of a quarter, and Canada was eight minutes smaller. When the opening price was quoted, the purchase was still quiet both inside and outside the industry, and the bulls were more vigilant due to rumors of the current situation. Both near and far months showed a soft market. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the customers and bulls sold off a lot, and some small factories had a consignment for this month. Therefore, although the volume of transactions was not large, the market situation trended weakly again. According to the current situation, due to the economic dryness in various places, it could not arouse the interest of the industry, so the market was inevitably presented a long-term sluggishness and short-term profit pattern. As a result, this month was 0.75 cents smaller, May was 0.1 cents smaller, June and July were 1.25 cents smaller, August was 2.5 cents smaller, and September was 5 cents smaller.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat is Still Silent, Spot Goods are Still Lively... A Total of 5,100 Bags Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for futures wheat was silent. Because there was an actual margin relationship this month, there were even fewer sales and purchases. The long-term trend was that the weather was not constant and there was little certainty about the new wheat annual harvest. Although the situation was not good, a large amount</p>
<h3>客秈到銷兩旺</h3>
<p>The客秈 market was active yesterday, with both arrivals and sales being robust. The market still shows signs of vitality. Arrivals continue from Hunan's Shashi, Nanjing's Jiangbei, and other places. The Fujian merchants are still the most active in purchasing. Yesterday, there was also brisk activity from Wenzhou merchants, further boosting the market. However, sellers are eager to sell, so prices have not changed much from the previous market. Throughout the day, Wenzhou merchants purchased 1,000 bags of Hunan's 机靖, Fuzhou merchants purchased 2,500 bags of Shashi糙米, 1,025 bags of Jiangbei, Nanjing, and Jiangxi 机米, and Quanzhou merchants purchased 300 bags of 机紅米 and 200 bags of 机元米. Prices were similar to the previous market. The outlook remains for a vibrant and steady market.</p>
<h3>黃豆提千升三四分</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of soybeans increased by three or four cents. The total market transaction was twenty-two to twenty-three carloads of various beans. Factories purchased seventeen or eighteen carloads, and local and export merchants purchased four or five carloads. Supply remains tight, and continuous telegrams report further increases. Therefore, both buyers and sellers are unanimously shifting their thinking in this brewing situation. Because the demand for杜豆 and 沙黃 remains scarce, they continue to be in a sluggish state. Yesterday, 70 bags of 杜緊 and 100 bags of 沙黃 were transacted, all purchased by local merchants.</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市疲漸如故</h3>
<p>Overseas silk weaving factories have ample stocks of Japanese silk on hand and do not need to seek external supplies for the time being. Telegrams from China's silk market are not improving. Importers' stockpiles of黃白廠絲 remain unasked for. European firms in Shanghai are all taking a wait-and-see approach. Yesterday, only Da Chang imported ten bales of white factory silk, and a Hangzhou silk factory also imported twenty bales. Prices remain weak.</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵客銷活潑</h3>
<p>The business of 会司鐵 with out-of-town merchants has recently shown development, so daily transactions have been quite active. The quoted price for thin boxes is $27.50 per box, and for thick boxes, it is $27 per box. It is estimated that more than six or seven hundred boxes were sold yesterday, and local merchants also sold more than five hundred boxes, so the market situation is very good. According to recent telegrams from overseas, there is very little spot stock available, and the selling prices are also high, so the market price in this port is unlikely to decline in the future.</p>
<h3>英馬口鐵來貨絡繹</h3>
<p>In recent days, arrivals of English tinplate have been continuous, so the stockpile in various foreign warehouses in Pudong and Puxi has reached three to four thousand boxes. However, the prices are relatively low due to the low arrival costs. The quoted price is $14.50 for 90-pound tinplate and $15.25 for 100-pound tinplate.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Women and Careers</h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>Some time ago, someone gave a speech at a girls' school, titled "Women and Careers." They said that the best career for women is to marry. This issue has sparked a lot of debate. I think this is exactly what that person meant by "humor." Which woman in today's society doesn't consider "marriage" as the only career? What about society, what about the country, it's all just empty talk. In the end, it's still about getting married. However, everyone is unwilling to say this fact out loud. When that person clearly stated it, everyone thought it was a strange idea. But in fact, that is precisely the current reality!</p>
<p>In fact, women today are indeed taking marriage as their only career. Whether it's pursuing education or engaging in social activities, in the end, it's still about getting married. Marriage is the destination for all women. Of course, of course, women should marry, and marriage is not a career, but now women's marriage is not for the sake of marriage, but for the sake of "having food and clothing." It's for the sake of a career. Don't you see? All the women who have married and become wives, who among them doesn't immediately break away from society? Except for those who go to movie theaters, dance halls, and all kinds of social gatherings, it's almost impossible to see them (of course, this refers to wealthy wives, and that person's speech was also addressed to wealthy women). This is clear evidence that women take marriage as their only career. Because at this point, they are already married and no longer need any social activities, and they are naturally guaranteed food and clothing. That is, they have already obtained a career now. The essence of why women take marriage as their only career lies in this.</p>
<p>However, is marriage really the best career for women? Of course not. This is just a temporary phenomenon that this society is exhibiting. Because women in this society are fundamentally appendages of men, and women have become a kind of commodity. That's why women can't help but take marriage as their only best career. If women can break away from the status of being appendages of men and liberate themselves from the status of wives to become people in society, then women will have no need to take marriage as their only best career. They will have independent abilities and opportunities for activity. They will be able to break through the shackles of money, step into the larger society, and become complete individuals. Of course, this is a matter for the future society.</p>
<p>And the realization of this future society depends on the efforts of women. Not only should women strive, but also male warriors who stand at the forefront of the times should also strive together. Originally, this is just one part of the solution to the entire social problem, and it is impossible to distinguish which comes first and which comes later, which is more important and which is less important; once the entire social problem is solved, everything will be solved. And in the meantime, women should work even harder for their own problems. Because this is a problem that concerns them directly.</p>
<p>Advanced women, pay attention to this issue! How to break free from the shackles of etiquette and money and become a person in society, this is something that everyone needs to carefully consider! You must know that "marriage is the only best career for women" is a disgrace! The greatest shame of modern women! How to fight out of this shame is the responsibility of the times for women!</p>
<h3>A Day at Xinhua</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>I love music. I used to go to the Town Hall to listen to music with my English teacher, Miss Li. She plays the piano very well and thought that I, as her student, could at least play a little something like the胡琴. However, I am a complete amateur musician who can't even distinguish "Do Re Mi." She once curiously asked me, "What's the fun in listening if you don't understand?" My answer was that it's precisely because I don't understand that I like to listen to music. I also like to dance. When Black Cat was next to the 大光明, I used to go "to sit at a table" alone every night, listen to music, and watch people dance. When my friends found out, they would definitely force me to "go into the sea (dance)," so I dared not enter the dance hall. I thought watching people dance was very good, wasn't it? Because of this weird temperament that others recognized, I earned the nickname "lukewarm water." In fact, they don't understand me.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was invited by Mr. Jin Peiyu to visit the Xinhua Opera Society, and I happily agreed. A night owl who doesn't know what the sun is actually got up at nine o'clock today. The intoxicating spring breeze brushed against my clothes, and our car headed towards善鐘路. I haven't seen the sun in years, and I haven't seen a spring morning in years. I leisurely felt like I was back in my childhood, flying a kite. I don't believe how a young man in his mid-twenties can seem like a dying old man!</p>
<p>I knocked on the door of No. 4 Meihua Lane, and all five fingers were stained black. I think it's a pity that Xinhua didn't put up a sign that the paint wasn't dry. As I stepped inside, Miss Zhang Wen, whom we (a familiar term for people from the same hometown) call "one two three four," was teaching····? It's dancing, just watching people dance. Because I was eager to go upstairs, I couldn't sit at a table and have a cup of coffee or tea. The men's dormitory is on the second floor; the women's, no, the young ladies' are on the third floor. All are wrought iron half-beds, white sheets and quilts, and colored pillowcases. If they practiced morning exercises in bed in the morning, I could introduce them to the director of sports films. This is a very beautiful new scene. Amateurs always like to talk like amateurs.</p>
<p>Recently, it seems that autograph books are very popular. I, an honest person who doesn't know how to be fashionable, also hid a small book and was kidnapping autographs everywhere. Naturally, this treasure trove,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>how could I easily let it go? Two young ladies' signatures are··· Don't let down your youth (Xu Jian)</p>
<p>Don't let down your golden age now (Yan Fei)</p>
<p>Thank you for reminding me. I don't even know that my youth exists anymore. I am heavily burdened by the burdens of life. I am a machine that lives for the sake of living. Youth, the golden age, have scattered like smoke in my life history. They will never have a day to return!</p>
<p>Retribution is clear, and the principles of heaven cycle. The small booklet was hidden in my pocket, and a beautiful "lai xie" (Mr. Yan Hua, this is Shanghainese) booklet was also placed in front of me. I think my original works are often buried in the wastepaper basket, which seems too bad, and now I can have the opportunity to write with a big brush. However, I think Mr. Yan Hua's is too boring (the writing is still very good). I want to change it···</p>
<p>I love to hear you say no to you,</p>
<p>Recruit an amateur musician,</p>
<p>Please</p>
<p>Don't say··· "No!"</p>
<p>The title on the flyleaf of Mr. Zhu Jian (i.e., blowing bubbles) is···</p>
<p>Rely on your parents at home,</p>
<p>Rely on your friends when you're out.</p>
<p>There is Miss Fei Li, a niece of Ouyang Yuqian, she</p>
<p>allowed me (readers, don't misunderstand the meaning of this sentence) but didn't write a word. I am such a petty person. In order to get revenge, I will introduce her anecdote.</p>
<p>Everyone calls Miss Fei Li "standard nervous." It is said that after she "that" (this is a new pronoun), she almost went crazy for a day, and that "crazy" posture is enough to be called a "top-notch" (old lady, is that how these three words are written?) standard. This is the origin of the "standard nervous."</p>
<p>Now it's time to thank Mr. and Mrs. Yan Hua and all the members (the old lady was absent due to a hoarse voice. Someone asked me who the old lady was. I don't know, I'm afraid of getting nothing). Once we come to our Xin Sheng Radio Station to broadcast, you don't say that you sing really well. (Tan style) A large group of people came to the Oriental Hotel in a mighty manner because I love to hear you say no. Mr. Song Wei and Miss Ye Ying taught me. The amateur musician is really clever. I learned half of it in two hours. According to the direct proportion, will it be done in another two hours? Please pay attention to the date of the first audition. I guess it will definitely sound good when I sing. After you listen to it, don't say... no...!</p>
<p>In the evening, the old painter Ding Song, his wife, his son, etc. all came from the Biao Hotel and took away the old and young painter's paintings and calligraphy. I will remember this no matter what. Autograph, autograph. The father of Violet, one of the银汉双星, came to add to the fun with a comical song, a French-style performance, and a series of "pulis." The old man looked very happy, unlike because of the Queen's (the Emperor's wife) affairs, "that." (The origin of the new pronoun is here.) It's a pity that many people thought I knew him but didn't introduce him.</p>
<p>When my interest waned, it was already three o'clock. Because the iron gate of my house was closed, I lived alone in the hotel. After following Xinhua for a day, I couldn't fall asleep this time. Standing on the balcony, watching the sunrise, the sun did rise from the east. I saw it clearly. Poor friends who can't travel to famous places, I sincerely invite you to sit quietly on the sundeck (of course, you can't always lean on the balcony of the Oriental Hotel) before the sun comes out. At the very least, it's no less than watching the sunrise on Mount Tai.</p>
<h3>Hiring a School Doctor</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>A doctor friend who is also a classmate and fellow villager, Mr. Huimin, finally obtained a bachelor's degree four years ago after graduating from a national medical school.</p>
<p>It is possible to be frugal with eating and clothing, but when you get sick, you can't do without a doctor. With this bachelor's degree, even though he didn't study abroad, wouldn't he be a doctor? At that time, we all congratulated him like this.</p>
<p>In fact, this was just an ignorant view. After Huimin ended his golden student life, he felt the gap between the education system and the social organization, and was pushed into society as if he was walking into a deep marsh.</p>
<p>His increasingly bankrupt family had great hopes for him. Every year, they scrimped and saved, using most of their income to support his education without complaint. After graduation, they wanted Huimin to come to Shanghai to find a quiet and well-paid job that could not only support himself but also support his family. This was what Huimin's family hoped for.</p>
<p>Taking his family's hardships to heart, Huimin also ran out of school with this hope. However, the world is vast, like a boundless sea. Should he go to a hospital to seek a position? He had no connections, and no relatives to recommend him. Should he try to open a small clinic himself? He didn't have that kind of financial strength. Should he just go home? Not to mention that several years of hard study would be in vain, what was even more difficult was that he couldn't bear the ridicule of his fellow villagers and old acquaintances.</p>
<p>In this way, Huimin stumbled here and there, staying in this city, and for several years had not formally resolved his career, living a hungry and semi-unemployed life.</p>
<p>After several years of being whipped by life, Huimin's demands had been lowered from being a doctor and opening a clinic. It would also be good if he could teach at a school. One day, he saw an advertisement in the newspaper for hiring a school doctor, and he ran to contact them with such hope.</p>
<p>Enduring a kind of contemptuous questioning from the doorman, Huimin was led into a room that served as both a teachers' lounge and an office. After the doorman reported the visitor's intention to the administrative director, he withdrew. The administrative director said "please sit down" and used his eyes to size up this new guest.</p>
<p>"What is your surname, sir?" the host asked.</p>
<p>"The surname is..."</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"...Province."</p>
<p>"Which school did you attend before...?"</p>
<p>"Graduated from a medical school." Huimin felt like a prisoner being interrogated in court, feeling uneasy and ashamed.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's very good..." The administrative director narrowed his eyes and continued, "However, the school doctor's job at our school is very troublesome. There are many students, and I'm afraid you, sir..."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter. Please tell me about your school's situation."</p>
<p>"We have a total of four schools, including the middle school and the elementary school, with a total of more than 800 people. We hold office twice a week, once for three hours, and additionally..."</p>
<p>"Four schools?"</p>
<p>"That's right, four schools share one school doctor. Additionally, there are two hours of physiology and hygiene at this school."</p>
<p>After listening to the administrative director's words, Huimin thought to himself that six hours per school every week, four times six is twenty-four hours, plus two hours of teaching, a total of twenty-six hours, which already exceeds the teaching time of all middle school teachers. At the same time, given the large number of people and the scattered locations of the schools, how would he have enough time? But it's better than being idle, so he asked:</p>
<p>"There are so many people, and they're not all in one place. I'm afraid it will be difficult for the students..."</p>
<p>"That's nothing. Anyway, it's just checking their bodies every semester and looking at them every week. Would the school really become a hospital?... Haha..." The administrative director's laugh was meaningful.</p>
<p>"In that case, what is your school's compensation...?" the guest asked.</p>
<p>"This needs to be discussed. Our school can only... can only offer 40 yuan per semester because of financial difficulties." The administrative director's face suddenly turned very stern.</p>
<p>The guest just stared at the other person in a daze.</p>
<p>"This is naturally only considered a subsidy for pocket money. Sir, when you are willing, it is entirely of a voluntary nature."</p>
<p>"Ah! Of a voluntary nature."</p>
<p>Huimin suddenly understood in his heart. He said goodbye and came out. In the small courtyard behind him, the students were noisily shouting.</p>
<h3>Killing the Family</h3>
<p>Huang San knew that he was no match for Li Jun, so he ran away quickly, sighing all the way: "I, the hero Huang San, am unlucky today!"</p>
<p>Li Jun flicked his hand casually, and with a punch, Huang San shouted "Ouch!" and fell far away. Xiao En was extremely surprised by the side!)</p>
<h3>A Decaying Nation</h3>
<p>— Borong</p>
<p>Recently, the newspapers have almost entirely become a portrayal of the observation of China. Although this portrayal is not very clear, making it impossible for us to make a thorough and in-depth observation of the entire national society, merely from the fragmentary words, after a little thought, it is enough to make us shudder. In this serious environment, how much more should we strive for self-improvement, deeply realizing our mission and future from reality? And further cultivate and enrich our strength as a preparation for the rejuvenation of the nation.</p>
<p>However, when we observe again, we should be even more surprised to discover that in this metropolis containing thousands of people, there are in fact two extremely different and opposing sides. On the one hand, the market is sluggish, shops are closing one after another, factories are stopping work, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, but on the other hand, more and more movie theaters and dance halls are opening, and the import of luxury goods is increasing unabated. The entire society is indulging in this kind of decadent and hedonistic morbid atmosphere, not looking back at the past, not looking forward to the future, only pursuing momentary and insane enjoyment; the opposition of these two phenomena really shows the great crisis of the entire society. Everyone who lives in this society should give it some thought and consideration.</p>
<p>The aggression of imperial capitalism has bankrupted our rural economy, and medieval handicrafts are obviously unable to compete with the magical modern machinery. However, on the other hand, the newly rising national capitalism needs to be carefully nurtured, but the forces of imperialism have completely destroyed this glimmer of hope. What did they bring us? Sensual movies, champagne, expensive cigarettes, luxurious fabrics, cosmetics, and everything that leads us to destruction. Their mentality is that they are afraid of us striving for self-improvement, and they will use all means to inject these toxins into the blood of our nation. But our compatriots - especially those pampered upper-class Chinese - have not realized this. No, it's not that they don't realize it, it's just that they deliberately close their eyes to this serious phenomenon. Their families are foreign goods sales factories, their bodies are foreign goods advertisement racks, their entire lives are Westernized lives, and the entire concession has become a market of ancient Rome, licentiousness, extravagance, dissipation, laziness, and decadence. What qualifications do these soulless and lifeless people have to undertake the arduous and great task of revitalizing the nation? The aggression of imperialism is not terrible, what is terrible is our own decay. Because of our decay, imperialism is able to implement their conspiracies and poisonous strategies unscrupulously. We try to think about the suffering of our compatriots in the Northeast, the unrest and disasters in rural areas across the country, and the depth of the economic crisis in the big cities. Will we not let our lives take a sharp turn downwards, and firmly cultivate our own will? Reality is cruel. It is foolish to ignore reality, and it is cowardly to escape reality. Only those who face reality head-on and sincerely transform it are the strong in human life.</p>
<p>Our nation is like a patient groaning in bed. For this patient, delicious food is useless, and strong medicine is harmful. We need a tonic that strengthens the foundation and restores health.</p>

<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Siamese Ramblings (9)</h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>There are only two reasons why overseas Chinese education in Siam is not developed. First, tuition is too expensive. Schools there charge monthly fees, averaging four Siamese baht per month. A year is calculated as twelve months (fees must also be paid during winter and summer vacations), which is forty-eight yuan. Adding books, stationery, and various miscellaneous fees, it costs no less than seventy yuan per year. If calculated in Chinese currency, that would be one hundred and twenty to thirty yuan. This is still for day students. If it is a boarding student, it is even more shockingly expensive. After all, not every overseas Chinese is rich. How can they afford such expensive tuition? Second, there is the muddle-headedness of some parents, because most of them are illiterate and think that they can still get rich without reading, so why send their children to school? There are indeed quite a few people like this.</p>
<p>Bangkok has the largest number of overseas Chinese, so education is also more developed than in the interior. Among them, the earliest established schools are Guangzhao of Guangdong, Peiying of Chaozhou, Yumin of Qiongzhou, Jinde of Hakka, and Peiyuan of Minnan. However, these so-called public schools all have a common problem, which is that the school board interferes with school administration. Not only is the hiring and firing of teachers decided by them, but even very minor things such as adding a few books to the library must be approved by them. It is a welcome phenomenon that the school board is willing to take responsibility, but to put it bluntly, most of them are laymen when it comes to education. So although the finances are very sufficient, they can't achieve anything good.</p>
<p>In recent years, private schools have developed very quickly. Because they are not constrained by the school board, and the teachers are mostly young people who have gone from the country, they are very energetic. Among them, the most hardworking are Xinmin, Chongshi,魂, and the newly established Huazhong and Nanyang last year. In addition to humbly studying and constantly improving in teaching, they have indeed made considerable contributions to the entire overseas Chinese community. For example, the implementation of co-education has had very good results. In recent years, the atmosphere of the overseas Chinese community has become more open than before, and the contribution of private schools is not small.</p>

<p>Film Supplement</p>
<h3>Regarding "The Evaluation of Flames" and Others (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Mu Tian knows full well that merely cursing film writers is not enough to destroy Chinese cinema. He must further sweep away all film criticism to achieve "universal peace." Therefore, he "puts on a mysteriously arrogant face" and "inflicts great destruction."</p>
<p>Regarding these claims, I only wish to respond with facts. To the best of my recollection, when "The Iron Plate Red Tears Record" was released, none of the film reviews were so "harsh" as to be "worthless." We did not, as he claims, think that simply because "the screenwriter and director went to the rural areas of Sichuan to find material, instead of always seeking the easiest route and drawing material from the narrow Jiangnan region," it was "worthy of excessive praise." On the contrary, we believed that the playwright's ability to grasp the theme of opposing feudal forces and exorbitant taxes was precisely what made "The Iron Plate Red Tears Record" so commendable. However, Mr. Mu Tian deliberately quibbles, saying it was "worthless," but I really don't know what he means. Of course, we know that he is an artist, and he should not overlook the fact that the director did not use better expressive methods to artistically express the substantial content of the film, which is a shortcoming that most film critics deeply regretted. However, he, without knowing on what basis, "actually brought out the spirit of a chivalrous knight from minor operas... fighting injustice."</p>
<p>Similarly, regarding "Flames," I know that none of the criticisms in the various newspapers were "so lenient as to be close to singing its praises." They realistically pointed out its merits and its flaws. Unlike Mr. Mu Tian, who only saw "A Zhen's watery eyes that are really flirtatious to 200 percent" and "growing vegetables and flirting," and overlooked the film's encouragement of millions of suffering people to extinguish the flames of imperialism. Only the so-called "avant-garde great poet" has such a foul-mouthed intention and courage to declare it "worthless". Here, I don't understand who "doesn't know where the progressiveness of the work lies? Where the regressiveness of the work lies?" In fact, he is "obstructing good tendencies." Furthermore, as for "Spring Silkworms," at that time, some people inevitably thought that because expectations were so high, there was no need to praise the good points, which were universally known, and that the shortcomings had to be fully pointed out to encourage the author to improve. This should be a very clear and obvious fact. Is there any malice in it? However, when we self-critically discovered our own mistakes, that is, when we realized that it caused the audience to misunderstand, we very humbly and sincerely corrected our own mistakes. Is this what is called "the joke of re-evaluation"? I believe that "to correct one's mistakes is better than not correcting them." Moreover, the lack of popularity of "Spring Silkworms" and its lack of dramatic elements have become a widely recognized conclusion. If, as he advocates, it were exactly the same as the original novel, only noble and progressive poets could understand it.</p>
<p>As for the criticism of Don Quixote, which pains him the most, it is even more contrary to the facts. Isn't that so? He scolds "Chinese film critics for their lack of common sense, not even knowing the A.B.C. of world literature," unlike him, who "bought a book on the development of European literature" and even "looked at it for twenty or thirty minutes," so he "understood the gist of it." But in fact, the criticisms in the various newspapers at that time almost all used his "understanding of the gist" of the development of European literature as a reference. The facts are all there. Why does he have to quibble like this? Moreover, at that time, a film magazine even published a special issue about it, with introductions from various aspects. Does Mr. Mu Tian not read the newspapers? I believe he should "at least have common sense."</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that Mr. Hou Feng seems to be objectively helping him strike at the Chinese film criticism that the environment wants to strike at, which is no different from the behavior of the likes of Gao Ming. I really admire their crusading courage. But I believe that Chinese film criticism will never be destroyed because of this. Chinese film criticism will always help Chinese films break free from all shackles and move forward! (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Brief Moment"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Brief Moment │ Nanjing │</p>
<p>Ever since Warner Bros.' "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," a painful and indignant impression has always lingered in my mind. Indeed, that is a remarkable masterpiece in the Hollywood film kingdom. I think all the audiences who have seen that work should not deny its great existence. Therefore, I sincerely recommend "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" to the audience in Shanghai, because it is a film worth appreciating, and you will inevitably gain many valuable things from it.</p>
<p>However, I think when we watch the above film and then watch other mediocre American films, we may feel disappointed. At least for me, I can't help but be disappointed in Columbia Pictures' "Brief Moment" when compared to it.</p>
<p>Of course, this is by no means an unfounded subjective assertion. In fact, in terms of content evaluation, it is a rather empty film that lacks seriousness. When I saw "End" on the screen, I immediately thought of the common saying "The prodigal son who returns is worth more than gold." Indeed, the whole story can be summarized in this sentence, and what the playwright emphasizes is only explaining the prodigal son's return, mainly to repay the wife's love.</p>
<p>The story is constructed like this: A banker's son, who spends money like water, falls in love with a singer and surprisingly abandons the so-called class concept and marries her. Because he spends his days chasing after singing stages and dance halls, the singer repeatedly advises him in vain, and eventually divorces him. Afterwards, the son deeply feels his wife's deep affection and strives to reform himself. Thus, they are reunited, and the husband and wife are as loving as before.</p>
<p>What is the theme here? Obviously, young masters should engage in proper business and not be obsessed with leisure. In the eyes of a virtuous wife and good mother, it is for the sake of her husband's own future, while for the young master himself, it is for the sake of his wife's persuasion. This is undoubtedly an extremely old worldview, a so-called truism that is not annoying, but also does not make people feel excited. If this also has its social significance, then the playwright is simply teaching wealthy children not to be self-destructive in order to maintain the existence of their class interests. However, this is just a pathetic illusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, does this film have any authenticity? Well, in depicting the extravagant lives of Ladies and Gentlemen, it does a pretty good job of drawing a true outline. Their lives consist of dancing, champagne, women, jazz music, horse racing, ice skating, driving around in cars, sightseeing, roulette gambling. . . . . . They don't understand what life is, they hate work and they don't have to work. They have plenty of money, just sign a name on the checkbook. In case of a deficit, their parents and brothers will naturally supply them. Under these circumstances, will they realize that they should serve society? We see that when the young master is copying accounts in his father's bank, he cannot endure hardship and eventually goes to watch horse races.</p>
<p>However, this only describes a little of their lives. The playwright absolutely does not unfold the collapse of the old or the growth of the new in their life sketches. We cannot feel that it is an inevitable phenomenon of collapse here. Thus, the playwright carries out his task. He not only does not strike at their upper class, but also vigorously maintains their existence. If someone says that when the young master is looking for a job and is constantly turned down, does this reflect the fear of unemployment? Then, I can answer that it is only to write about the young master's determination to do good, so it is okay to do that.</p>
<p>The director is more or less smooth in narrating a story. But the occasional misuse of the camera proves his lack of cultivation. Neither the male nor female lead has any special talents. In particular, the male lead is frivolous, exaggerated, and even more childish, while the female lead is just not good enough.</p>
<h3>After Watching the Little Women Preview</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Great Shanghai Theater, I had the pleasure of seeing the film "Little Women," which I had been looking forward to for months. Of course, having experienced and expressed the psychology of each character in the play, I feel an even closer connection. However, those who were moved by the unrestrained and profound emotions have probably already become the Jiangzhou Sima in the audience.</p>
<p>The script adapts some of the plots from the original book ("Little Women and Good Wives," which has been combined into one book in the United States), but it has already become a grand spectacle. Katharine Hepburn plays the central figure with great detail. The other people also express their individuality. The performance of Aunt March is especially hilarious, which is enough to relieve the tension of emotions. I know that many people who have read my translation of "Little Women and Good Wives" are delighted to hear of the arrival of this film and are eager to see it. After watching the film, they can review the plots in the book, and they can see the characteristics of literary art and screen art, and see that they do not take away from each other but actually complement each other. In recent months, I have often seen American magazines, such as "Literary Digest" and "Parents Magazine," praising this film. Many film review agencies in the United States have praised it, saying that it has educational value. I feel today that it is indeed worthy of praise. I think elementary school students can also appreciate it (in addition to the four "Little Women," there are also many scenes of children), not to mention those who have received secondary education or above. This kind of sincere, pure, and uplifting film, families and schools should introduce it to their children, because the original books "Little Women and Good Wives" are not only literary readings, but also educational readings.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Record of War Drums and Swords (Nana (5)</h3>
<p>— Yin Ming</p>
<p>In terms of position, Antri is a colonel, while George is only a major, so Antri said in the tone of a superior ordering a subordinate: "You will immediately return to the camp to report. I will soon have an order sent to your officer there. Your vacation has been cancelled. Now you are serving the Royal Family, and you must immediately take the entire team to Acquilina." George shouted: "Antri! How can you treat me like this?" Antri said: "George, it is for the sake of loving you that I prevent you from falling for life." He said, returning to his room to get dressed.</p>
<p>Not long after, Antri was dressed, and he ran over to see Nana. At that time, Nana was still lying on the bed. Hearing someone knock on the door, she was a little unhappy to pay attention, but the knocking became tighter and louder. Nana said slowly, "Go away, I still want to sleep." Antri said outside the door: "I am Colonel Mu Fa. I want to see you immediately." Su Yi was awakened, and she led Antri into Nana's room. Antri entered the room, and seeing that Nana had not gotten up, he put a small package on her bed. Nana asked him what it was. Antri said: "This is the full price you pay for all the love my brother has for you. There are 50,000 francs in it. With this money, you don't have to be with him anymore. You see, I gave it to you without you even asking. My brother is not allowed to go to you from now on. He is leaving for Acquilina at midnight tonight. I can't let him lightly throw away his life's future." Nana asked: "Does George know that you came to me?" Antri said: "Of course not. But I did this entirely for the sake of loving him." Antri finished speaking and was about to leave, but Nana stopped him. She jumped out of bed. She stood in front of Antri and said: "I didn't want to discuss this matter with you narrow-minded people." Her voice was extremely cold, filled with suppressed anger. "But, my dear Colonel, you need to know that the reason why you did this is not because you love your brother. I have also seen people like you. They live the lives of monks for their entire lives. Look at me! I belong to George, I love him. He also loves me. Now you want to punish your brother, because what I have, you don't even understand. This is where you are different. Now to prove that what I said is not wrong . . . . . ." She finished speaking and kissed Antri very hard on the lips. "Now, my dear Colonel," Nana laughed coldly after kissing him, "you know what kind of hypocrite you are. For many years, your brain has been deceiving your body . . . . . . hehe . . . . . . You love your brother. God knows. Take your money and get out! I will hate myself for the rest of my life for ever touching you!" Antri suffered this great insult and left with his head down. On Nana's side, she didn't believe that George would really leave her, so she forgot about Antri's visit after it was over and didn't think it was a big deal. But at dusk, a carriage came and stopped in front of her door, loaded with luggage. George jumped out of the carriage. Nana was stunned by this scene. He came in. He hugged her. He told her very calmly and straightforwardly that he was going on a long journey. (To be continued)</p>
