<p>愼。</p>
<p>兩年前之今日。淞滬陡起戰端此次戰端之起因。緣爲日本軍國主義者野望侵略之一面諭當時情勢。我國國民雖同具抗日之决心。有與敵偕亡之志氣而以國力削弱遂多隠忍遷就之念。不料日本認定我民族之無能衆心之不一致。乃起而挑衅。欲在上海擴充其經濟勢力而伸張其政治支配權。先以空言威脅以爲卽可收得戰爭。勝利之實效。詎知我國民憤激之情已達極點。縱使我無槍砲飛機等新式武器與之爭鬭卽徒手肉搏亦必生死一拼。用爭我民族之存立。是以不顧利害不計成敗竟以一隅之師而與有计劃有組織之帝國主義軍隊相搏戰也。</p>
<p>回憶淞滬血戰當時。吾人誠不勝其憤恨交集。撫念以往創痛。閘北吳淞血跡猶新。昔日繁盛之通衢迄今仍爲瓦礫之塲人命之被摧殘。經濟之被破壞。事隔二年。猶如昨日。經鏖戰三十一日之結果。十九路軍第五路軍及憲兵第六團部衆。究難以有限之部隊。劣勢之武器。與彼傾國之師相抗拮。是以不能不終於退却。夫以我國今日之國窮民疲。又當瀋陽事變之後。國力旣遭嚴重之損失固亦自知不能對外作戰。其所以能起而撑支。勉與强梁一搏者非眞全恃軍隊之力也恃有我民族力量爲軍隊後援耳。當時滬上一般民衆勇躍輸將之情形舉國人民一致赴敵之氣概。不可一世故在前綫作戰之士兵。絶無後顧之憂。乃得與强敵拚命一戰。此種形勢。惟民國十五年革命軍北伐時庶幾似之。是故淞滬戰爭。我國雖不幸而敗然爭鬭精神之創發。民族興衰之關鍵。固不必盡恃眼前之勝利與失敗爲斷也。</p>
<p>在「一二八」戰後期年之間。熱河喪失。察東危急。赡念前途。不勝悚懼。日本在華北。仍趨積極。我國則自淞滬戰後。迭遭變故困難愈增。一般城市工商業卽甚疲敝。農村經濟。尤有朝不保夕之虞。而環顧世界情形。更不能不警惕有加矣。</p>
<p>中日關係。在日方宣傳。以爲有次第好轉之象徵。今後將尋覔解决之途徑。</p>
<p>而究其實際。初未放棄其傳統的侵略政策。溥儀稱帝。卽其一例。至於美日兩國之間。表面上以美國正急於鎭定其國内之經濟恐慌。同時擬先以不流血之經濟鬭爭困日本。故似暫緩和。然已進一步從事於建築龐大之海軍艦艇與樹立有力之空軍則必將以武力爲最後决算。可以想見。蘇日關係。根本卽不能相容中東鐵道之出賣。不過圖一時之和緩。且利害衝突。與日俱增。勢不能不出於一戰。况英日諒解。早成過去。此後英日之間。亦將由友誼而變爲敵對。我國處此多角關係之中。當國恥重疊之後。撫今追昔。能不咬定牙根。繼續奮鬭發揮我民族之精神。使此以往之血涙不致枉流耶。</p>

<p>云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　外長蒂杜樓斯哥耳病未愈、故羅馬尼亞王及保加利亞王在西雅那之會晤、渠不能前往參加、保國總理慕哈諾夫亦將留守羅京、與外長蒂氏有所商洽、巴爾幹半島各國之互不侵犯公約、將於二月二日在南斯拉夫京城簽字、届時蒂杜樓斯哥當可痊愈、渠將與土耳其·希臘·</p>
<p>南斯拉夫等國外長會晤、至於保加利亞、事後在若干時限之内、追加此項公約、則聽其自便、聞巴爾幹半島未來之互不侵犯公約規定、締約各國彼此互相保障領土之完整、其次則互相保障邊境之安全、</p>
<p>保加利亞所以反對新公約者、其關係正在此等條約、緣保國政府對於和平條約所定之疆界、原不滿意、新訂之巴爾幹互不侵犯條約、不啻對和平條約又加一層保障、故保國不能贊成也、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c48">全歐人士注意希特勒與戈林衝突復辟與對奧政見不合兩雄不並立影響甚大 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）　德總理希特勒與普魯士總理戈林、皆爲現代歐洲志力最强堅之人、世人視戈林、不啻爲希特勒之左右手、但近日三人意見相左、迭起齟齬、此爲國家社會黨中最新之一幕、全歐人土莫不注意、結果如何、</p>
<p>尙難推測、</p>
<p>二人意見不同之點略如下述、（一）德國欲使奧成國家社會黨之國家、非先去奧總理杜爾夫斯不可、希特勒近見列强表同情於奧國、欲稍改變其對付奧總理之政策、但戈林則反對甚力、致希特勒處於進退兩難之地位、（二）戈林似欲恢復皇室、使之重握政權、但希特勒則不願廢皇之復位、而自削其權威、故反對復辟不遺餘力、（三）保加利亞共産黨人狄米特羅夫前、</p>
<p>受國會縱火案之嫌疑、雖已審明無罪、然猶繫獄未釋、希特勒欲釋出之、</p>
<p>緃狄氏或將在他國作反對國家社會黨之有力宣傳、然亦不能預防及此、而永遠覊禁之、但戈林則不如是主張、（四）希特勒所擬之日耳曼新憲法、欲縮小普魯士土地、此亦爲戈林所不能贊同之一事、（五）希特勒在宗敎爭執上、主張全德主敎穆勒告假離職、而暫以他人辦理宗敎改善事宜、避免政治勢力、但戈林則答曰、「吾人披上褐衫、卽非耶敎徒、亦非天主敎徒」云、戈林主張宗敎宜服從國家、致宗敎爭執之和解迄難成立、</p>
<p>凡此五點、乃希特勒與戈林漸相冰炭之原因、德國人民雖多數擁護希特勒、但戈林亦非無黨羽、如二人衝突加劇、則德國將有甚重要之發展、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　昨夜全國軍官聯合會正在慶祝廢皇七十五歲生辰時、忽有載重汽車載警察與挺進隊風馳電掣而至、將會所包圍、諸軍官按照舊習、於鐘鳴十二句時均須起立爲廢皇舉杯祝嘏、是時警察擁入、命衆高舉兩手、並命衣帝國戎裝之軍官各卽歸家、歡祝禮未行、往年此項祝禮未受禁阻、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>林陸相謂日俄均採防勢軍備</p>
<p>（東京）　政友會内田信也二十七日在衆議院預算總會關於軍縮問題提出質問、謂政府前年十二月提出日内瓦軍縮會議之日本軍縮案、稱「本軍縮案爲可以代替華盛頓及倫敦兩條約之適當案件、」將來一九三五年舉行軍縮會議時、日本必受其束縛、政府爲何不撤回此提案、大角海相、</p>
<p>對此答辯、謂此項提案未曾列入軍縮會議之討論題目中、而未有機會議明内容、各國迄今迭次提出議案、並每次變更其内容、故日本亦照其先例、變更内容亦可、吾人以海相之答辯、始明瞭政府意見、日本將於一九三五年軍縮會議、不爲日本從前提案受束縛、擬提出要求變更比率之新軍縮案、（二十七日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　衆議院本日上午十時開預算總會、政友會内田信也因昨日質問未完、繼續質問海軍問題、内田問、余想一九三五年之危機、原因在於倫敦條約之結果、政府變更如何、</p>
<p>大角海相答、直接原因、似非在倫敦條約之結果、然可謂危機原因之一、　　内田於是前進其辭鋒、論及根據於倫敦條約實行减稅之不當、及當時陸軍大更之態度謂、倫敦條約成立之結果、政府勉强實行一萬三千萬元之减稅、因此至今日不得不實行十二萬萬元之海軍補充計劃、以補充該條約之缺陷、據五一五事件判决、少壯將校均謂倫敦條約之缺陷、應由政黨負責、請問海軍大臣是否承認其責在於政黨、</p>
<p>大角海相答、政黨無其責任、又不行减稅、其結果比較良好、</p>
<p>此時民政黨議員高聲非難海相减稅不然之言明、大角海相繼言謂、减稅實行、爲本人未就任海相前之事、故取消關於本問題之意見、海軍當局祇有淸算過去爲將來盡全力之一途而已、</p>
<p>海相答辯後、内田言愈論趨專門的事項、卽質問第二次補充計劃完成後之日美海軍力比率如何、而言及華盛頓倫敦兩條約謂、據美報載海相意見、海軍條約之比率、於日本不滿、故要求修改、海相承認此事乎、</p>
<p>海相答、承認、</p>
<p>内田問、比率問題旣然不滿、則兩條約、</p>
<p>之廢棄通告、須於本年内提出、海軍當局之方針如何、</p>
<p>海相答、未年内調查各方而情後、决定方針、</p>
<p>内田之質問至此完畢、其後民政黨高木正年質内外相、比率問題、外相意見如</p>
<p>何、</p>
<p>廣由外相答、以比率問題、維持國防平均問題因人類創始以來、僅有十數年之經騐、比率利限問題是否逼當、不能言明　　高木不轉其攻擊方針、追問外相謂、然則外相有無要求變更比率之意、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、對此答辯與大角海相之</p>
<p>答辯同樣、</p>
<p>大角海相亦起立答辯謂、海軍當局擬要求修改比率、於是政支民政兩黨議員要求提出參考村料、至十一時半會長宣休會、</p>
<p>豫算總會下午一時十六分再開、政友會砂田重政爲質問人、砂田以農村問題爲其質問中心、提起時局區救事業問題内政會議之農村問題等後、言及農家經濟狀態謂、據農林省統計、農村收入與支出、昭和七年度支出超過收入十二萬九千萬元、八年度超過八萬五千七百萬元、政府雖减輕稅金·恐不能抵補如此巨大數目、其根本的解决方法、祇有提高農産物價、政府所見如何、</p>
<p>後藤農相答、政府正在考慮提高農産物價問題、</p>
<p>砂田謂、米榖制法並無提高米價之效果、</p>
<p>後藤農相答、政府實施米榖統制法後、巳見米價之安定、</p>
<p>砂田其次非難政府並無根本方策處理過多産米、並言及蠶絲問題生絲問題等、而警告政府、須於早時樹立對於養蠶之根本方策、後對財政當局質問、政府對於結成經濟聯盟之國際情勢、有何種應付方法、</p>
<p>於是與高橋藏相交數次論戰後、砂田停止質問、其次登擅質問者爲民政黨之川崎克、川崎對新任陸相林鐵十郎質問减少滿洲事件費之理由、並謂、滿洲事件費何年起解消其特别費名義、而作爲普通費、</p>
<p>林陸相答、在「滿洲國」討匪事業已無如以前之激烈、使用子彈大减、故减少事件費、取消特别費各義自何年度起、現尙不能言明、</p>
<p>川崎問、滿洲國國防費、將來由日滿兩國中何國担任、</p>
<p>小野寺深理局長答、此事未便言明、</p>
<p>川崎其次質問滿洲國鐵路之警備負担問題、明年以後之警備改善費、及日俄在俄滿國境之關係等、</p>
<p>陸相答謂、外間雖有種種風說、然日俄兩國之間、並無搆成事件之理由、日本採防勢軍備、蘇俄亦然、</p>
<p>川崎至此轉其質問之方向於山本内相與高橋藏相、提起時局匡救費及財政問題謂、日本財政以今日方針推進、不堪憂慮其前途、藏相擬以自然增收爲財源樹立財政計劃、此事不使財政失其安定乎、　　高橋藏相答、本人並以自然增收爲財源、改革財政之意、余謂將有自然增收之時、則樹立增稅、或其他改革之機會也　　時達下午六時議長遂宣告散會、（廿七日日聯電）</p>

<p>羅馬電　日本駐意大使松島昨日晋見墨索里尼首相、謂奉日本政府訓令、請求墨索里尼說明其所作「遠東」一文之政治的意義、按該文係墨索里尼爲美國通信社所作、曾在一月七日「意大利人民報」發表、據日本方面意見、墨索里尼文中對於日本之論斷、似屬不近情、文中大意、謂日本退出國聯會後、對於和平或戰爭、可爲所欲爲、目前則確有戰爭之危險云、；因此文係出自意相手筆、故影響頗鉅、意大利各報更多因此發揮意見、與意相取同樣論調、甚且意大利官文書中、亦多流露此種見解、例如參議院提出之海軍預算報告書、卽有類似之口吻、然松島大使晋見墨索里尼時、並未提及此種關係意國内政之文件、僅稱意日兩國經濟關係頗爲良好、且兩國間素無何種政治爭執、意大利對於遠東問題較諸其他歐洲各國更少關係、今乃意欲自居歐洲反對日本帝國主義運動之領導之領地位、其故固何在乎、意大利各報殆故意利用「黄禍」之危辭聳動聽聞、藉以喚起歐洲諸國間之合作精神歟、日本大使特就此節、對於意相有所質詢云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>新德里　日本市塲、因外間盛傳印度將提高人造絲輸入關稅、頗爲搖動、因代表澤田特於二十六日訪問印度商務長官坡亞、詢問此事、坡亞承認此事實後、表示印度政府意見、謂最近印度綿業受人造絲壓迫、擬於二月五日對中立法會議提出人造絲製品輸入關稅案、日代表團得此確答後、俄然表示緊張空氣、代表團員寺尾貿易局長緩期出發新德里、印度前次突然提高雜貨關稅、今次又有此舉、日代表團認印方面無誠意、於是决定卽與本國政府恊議對策、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>看了上述、可以明瞭他們固守區域的嚴重、在該區的邊境、日夜都分佈着步哨假使見日僞兵隊到襲、第一綫步哨、卽投擲土製爆彈、以通知山上之步哨、由一傳二、由二傳三、而報告本部、一霎時全體均逃入山間的密林中、假使日僞軍在深夜進襲、則在山頂舉火、由此山而彼山、由烽炎的暗號、傳知本部、相率逃往預定的塲所、武裝人員、抵抗日僞軍隊、務使日僞軍隊集中一處、其他人員得乘機逃脫、而彼等則依預定路徑、且戰且退、終使外來者莫明其途徑而退却武裝黨員、對於戰死的黨員、只取其槍械、至其屍體、均捨之不顧原來他們之視武器、重於人的屍骨、當逃避時、均强固綁腿、背負日常必需用品、及可維持六七日之糧食、隨處爲家、及見日軍前來、又逃避他處、他們熟識山路、不啻走在自己的屋子裏、不論如何的羊偒曲徑、不致迷路、部落中所剩餘的、只是老弱婦稚、該政府中心區域王隅溝外十餘里外、駐有日本總領事館警察依蘭溝分署、於去年五月至十一月間、前後與附近該軍交戰八十七次之多、依蘭日警署六里外之山頂上、卽有該政府的第一防綫步哨、</p>
<p>至於該區域内的子彈火藥等、聞係自製、製造者是一韓國六十餘歲的老者、曾任兵器製造廠的技師、名呌郭相學、曾在朝鮮咸南道的深山中、私製彈藥、參加獨立運動、此後避居遼寗柳河縣、繼續製造火藥槍彈、並參預各種獨立運動、去年八月、被該政府召去、現與助手兩人、在王隅溝的某地下室中、製造予彈炸藥、供給該政府之用、</p>
<p>當日軍進攻時、雖曾燒毁其房屋廬舍、以斷絶他們的歸路、王隅溝等地、幾掃蕩一空、但不久他們又整隊歸來、從事工作、他們逃避深山中的生活、夏天露宿草叢、冬季挖穴羣居、集五六人於一穴、其中且有印刷機等、所以雖在逃亡生活中、仍不忘其工作、</p>
<p>他們雖力圖保守、但經日僞軍數度的襲擊與死亡、人口不免减少、爲擴大聲勢與工作起見、極力引誘朝鮮農民與鐵道沿綫工作人員、使加入抗日工作、并分給土地、使他耕作、必要時使他們也加入抵抗外敵、或運搬物件、</p>
<p>近來更爲鞏固該政府區域之基礎、一改從前的直接行動、組織·宣傳·暴動等工作、同時並行、凡在該境内的人民、均需受武裝黨員的監視、束縛其自由、嚴防其投歸日僞軍、黨幹部爲凖備過冬、所以嚴禁秋收榖類的輸出區域以外、假使有違反這命令的、不但認爲反革命、且當塲施刑、</p>
<p>去年二月間、日僞當局、組織「間島共匪歸順審查委員會」、至十一月、前去歸順的、據說有千餘人之多、這些都是久居間島深山處的鮮農與土著、卽不知道自已所住的土地已是誰屬、更不知什麽蘇聯或日本、他們只知道日出而耕、日入而息、爲温鉋而終日耕耘、</p>
<p>近來日僞當局、均極力設法進攻、武力與政治兼施、所以有間島地圖治安維持會·及滿洲國恊和會間島地方事務局等的設立、一方恊同軍警各機關、武力與政治同時進行、則該項組織之命運如何、實未可逆料也、（完）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c127">讀書的根本問題 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>（一）讀書野心大和選擇學習科目之無標凖　　……我是貴圖書館的一個讀者，因了貴館的賜與，養成了我的讀書習慣。在初無非是没目的的瀏覽，然愛書如命，差不多最好世界上的書籍，都給我看閲一過纔心滿意足；但因環境的壓迫，不得不大大失望。…（章廷栅來信）</p>
<p>……讀了本月十三十四兩日的「讀書問題」之後，我非常煩悶，因爲我正是一個（迷茫學海）的人。我對於各種學科都喜歡研究，都有興趣；我旣喜歡研究社會科學，丨因爲它能告訴我人與人的關係，又愛好自然科學，丨因爲它能解釋自然現象。因此我正如同孟子所說「熊掌我所欲也魚亦我所欲也」，但是從先生們的解答裏，我知道這是「二者不可得兼」的。然而究竟舍那個取那個，我却眞是没有勇氣來决</p>
<p>定。我好比陷在三角戀愛的沈淵中，對於兩個女子一般的愛好，呌我怎樣來權其輕重，專門學習一個科目呢？但是，你們希望我决定一個科目，事實上也祇能議我學習一個科目，於是我便忍痛放棄自然科學，習讀社會科學罷丨……（董源來信）</p>
<p>讀了以上兩信，使我們憶及日本文學家夏目金之助所說的話，他說··</p>
<p>「年富力强的時候，每有於自已的專門學業上成些貢獻之前，以爲必須博通全般，必須把古今上下數千年的書籍讀破牠們的想頭，若須如此，那就到了白頭，也水不會有博通全般的時期的。像我這樣的人，　　對於英文學全體，眞還不能說是通，大約　　就是今是後再過二三十年也是依然一樣地不　　能通的」…」見郁達夫文學的人所微引）</p>
<p>夏目金之助這一段話確是讀書經騐之談；而我們在「關於選擇科目的幾個問題上，也鄭重向讀者勸告··希望他們選擇科目不宜太多，「因爲野心太大了的時候，失望的事情也一定愈加來得多，結果反要變得自暴自棄，一事也做不成功，所以我們初學的人，最怕的是在唱不能實踐的高調·」（郁達夫先生語）</p>
<p>所以，從事實上講，從讀書效率上講，讀書在開始時是不可抱奢望的。但是我們從這兩封信中，我們又可以看出：每個靑年人的求知慾的旺盛及讀書野心的巨大；他們對於每一本書都要讀過，對於宇宙間每一椿事，每一現象都想懂得。因此，如同董源君來信所說，初學的人對於各種學科是並無愛憎，一視同仁的。這是一種不可過止的𤍠望，雖則要受事實上的障碍，但究竟是不可以消滅的。因此，我們知道請初學的人縮小研究範圍，自是正當而且必要的事；但是爲了這個原故，就呌他們去選科學習，告訴他求知慾太高，是要失收的，則不但會使他們的研究興趣低落，而且他們的選擇科目也一定是漫無標凖，在爲這種選擇並没有什麽特殊的理由。</p>
<p>因此，我們對於初學的人，現在不希望他們卽刻作分科學習，而主張他們先讀些基礎常讀的書，（結論及辦法在三十日公表）</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>今天是「一二八」紀念日，這個紀念日的意義，我想不但上海的小朋友們深切瞭解，即是全國的兒童們，也不致於糢糊吧！當兩年前的今天，我們這偉大的上海，曾遭敵人猛烈的襲擊，幸得我軍忠勇抵抗，否則上海便有被佔領的危險！</p>
<p>一二八紀念，已經兩度過去了，就是這麽一年一度的紀念，究竟有什麽意義？大家總得想點切實的辦法，來挽回這個刧運，來洗刷這個恥痕；喂！小朋友們！中年人，老年人，恐怕都負不了責任，還是年輕志高的少年，來努力幹吧！</p>
<p>諸位想想：上海這個地方，是號稱東方物質文明的都市，是中國東方的門户，敵人敢從東門進攻，我們就不可向他們的西門還擊麽！</p>
<p>小朋友們記牢，民國二十一年的一二八，敵人用飛機大砲攻破我們的東門，再過十年，我們也用飛機大砲在敵人的西門示威。不過有一點要注意，我們所要復仇的，是認正那些面目猙獰的敵人，並不是手無寸鐵無抵抗的羣衆。（因爲當時敵人不分皂白，殘殺我平民，但我們决不妄殺無辜。）</p>
<p>現在是弱肉强食的世界，什麽「和平」「公理」，一切都是騙人的幌子；若再含垢忍辱下去，那麽我們中國决難生存於未來的世界，小朋友們！這是我一句得透澈語。記得岳武穆滿江紅有句：</p>
<p>「……壯志飢餐胡虜肉，笑談渴飲匈奴血；莫等閒白了少年頭，空悲切！」</p>
<p>希望未來的主人翁，都是忠勇的戰士，而能效法岳武穆那樣「精忠報國」的偉大精神！</p>

<p>— 石愚生</p>
<p>西北風兒呼呼地，天氣冷了，小朋友們也縮起來了。</p>
<p>這「縮」字，倒很恰當，看：懶惰的小朋友，不就縮在家裏不入學了嗎？畏怯的小朋友，不就駝着背脊，攏着袖兒縮起來了嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友們，這都是没志氣，不長進的孩子，現在的中國，再也不容許這輩孩子的！</p>
<p>「冷」，何足怕，走進運動塲，一轉兩轉賽跑，十脚八脚𤧣子，不就暖和和地流着汗嗎？躱在家裏，縮着頭頸，那還不是一樣的冷？而且，越怕冷，就越覺得冷；越覺得冷，就越冷了！</p>
<p>我們有志氣的，長進的孩子，不當怕冷，應該和寒冷奮鬥，小朋友們，要我們奮鬥的，正多着呢！</p>

<p>喜鵲呌，客人到；老鳥呌，有惡報；我想喜鵲老鳥同是鳥，凡是鳥兒都好呌，客人到不到，喜鵲那裏會知道？鳥呌有惡報，迷信更可笑！</p>

<p>— 王微女士</p>
<p>這裏是一件故事，很適宜於小朋友們的</p>
<p>當已故美國總統佛蘭克林Ｂenjamin</p>
<p>FranKlinl還只七歲的時候，有一天，學校放假，他袋裏裝裏滿了銅元，凖備去買一些好玩的東西。</p>
<p>他望着一爿專賣孩子們玩的店家跑。在路上看見中另一個孩子吹着一只呌具，這聲音很使他歡喜，於是他就把袋裏的銅元一齊拿給店家，照樣買了一個。　　佛蘭克林回到家裏，跳着吹着，心裏非常高興。全家都被呌具聲擾得不安。他的哥哥姊姊們知道他把所有的銅元只買了這樣一個呌具，都笑他愚笨，告訴他所給的銅元比呌具的原價多了四倍。如果他把餘下的銅元去買别的，一定還可以買許多好玩的東西。</p>
<p>他們這樣譏笑他。他覺得非常懊惱，就大哭起來。這反響給他的悲哀比他的歡喜更多。</p>
<p>從此以後，這件事情便成了佛蘭克林的格言。他長大了以後，每次看見别人去買不必要的東；捨了安定的生活去追求虚榮；毁壤了身體去鑽營富貴；抛棄了前程去希圖享樂；他總自言自語地說：「可憐的人啊，你所給與這只呌具的代價太貴了呵！</p>
<h3 id="c175">手指斷了 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>在放寒假後的第一日，聰兒閒得没有事可做，他忽然想起了一件事，是先生在没有放寒假的時候，對我們說在寒假裏要實騐的。於是聰兒很快的拿了一雙玻璃杯，裏面盛滿了一杯淸水，同時拿了一本自然敎科書。剛要走到書房裏去，他的弟弟敏兒從外面停來，拫驚共的問他道：「哥哥，你在做什麽事？是不是喝冷水？先生曾經講過：「冷水喝不得，因爲裏面有許多微生蟲，喝了肚子要痛的「。難道你没有知道嗎？」哥哥也不去回答他，一聲響的獨自到書房裏去了。弟弟很奇怪，莫明其妙的也跟着他的哥哥同去。</p>
<p>到了書房，聰兒把一杯淸水放在書桌上，同時把那本書略略的看過了一遍，便把他自已那隻右手的食指放在那杯淸水中，從杯外看去，瞧見那食指好像斷了。同時聰兒的臉上現出很快樂的樣了，因爲他實騐的結果和書中所說的正是一樣。但是那年小的敏兒倒詫異起來，因爲瞧見哥哥的手指斷了，不覺得痛，倒反而覺得快樂。他奇怪的問道：「哥哥，你的手指斷了，痛嗎？」哥哥笑笑的對他說：「弟弟，你弄錯了，我的手指一些也不痛。因爲水有曲折性，從杯外看起來，就好像我的手指是斷了。</p>
<p>你不信，試試看！說罷·敏兒仍舊不能十二分的相信，聽得哥哥呌他試試，就把手指放在水中，居然看見自已的手指也斷了，但是一些也不痛。</p>
<p>「哥哥的話！是應騐了，我現在相信水有曲折性的。」敏兒很得意洋洋的跳出去了。</p>

<p>冬之神帶着雪花姑娘來了。雪花姑娘嫌世界太污濁，伊把雪花散佈在地面上，使它變成潔白。小朋友們是再喜歡没有的，雪的遊戲：滾雪球，打雪仗，做雪人，………但是，小朋友們可知道關於雪的一段傳說？這是很有意義的。</p>
<p>在許多年以前，雪也是一樣到了冬天降落到地面上來；不過，那個時候，雪和米粉一樣可以做食糧吃。而且那時候的人們還不曾曉得種稻種麥；就以雪做主要的食糧。他們夏天吃的是果品，冬季吃的便是雪，雪到冬天從天空中降下來，堆到地上堆在每家人家的門前，人們也以爲這是永久吃不盡的了，便很輕視他。並不把它在心上，所以把吃剩的雪，都抛棄了，也不想法把它儲藏起來。反而踐踏它，污辱它。</p>
<p>不久，冬之神曉得了這回事，伊非常震怒。伊憤恨人們暴殄天物，不該這樣蹧蹋食糧。它就使雪遇到熱變成水，雪再不能當做食糧了。伊對人們說：「你們今後要用自已的力量去謀食了。」人們雖然很懊悔，但這是自已的過失，只得另外想謀食的方法，於是他們便發明耕種五榖來代替做食糧了。</p>

<p>小朋友，你們多半是在學校走讀，散學回到家裏來，家長或是服務職業；或是料理家務，没有工夫監督你用功，但是自已切勿一味負着玩要，要自已在每天支配一定時間，去復習這一天的功課。</p>
<p>除了復而外，還要買些補充讀本自已去看，美國的小學生，所看的補充讀本，比敎科書多至好幾倍，可見得專靠敎科書，是嫌得益太少了。</p>
<p>我看見許多小朋友，往往當散學後，喜歡在馬路小書攤上拿錢租什麽石印的小本子連環圖書小說看，這種書涉於荒唐迷信，看着是有損無益的，不及看補充讀本的得益多了。</p>
<p>補充讀本種類很多，有說故事的，有說笑話的，有說科學常識的，一切等等你把各大書局的「兒童書類」内目錄一看你就知道那些書呌什麽名目。</p>
<p>買補充讀本，要合自已的程度，有高年級的；有低年級的，照自已年級買來，看着自然是有興味。</p>
<p>看補充讀木，勿東翻西閲，是要將這一本自首至尾都看完了，再看那一本，有些不明白的字，可以問問先生，或是問問父兄，看得有興味，包管你喜歡看，比較無謂的玩耍，好得多了。</p>

<p>童子軍分幼童子軍，男童子軍，和女童子軍。幼童子軍，年幼的組織的，男童子軍是男子組織，女童子軍是女子組織的，你可以加入女童子軍了。</p>
<p>我們雖然有了體育課，但是有的地方，總没有童子軍那麽周到，體育課當然也能使我們身體强健。但是童子軍敎我們在各方面所應有的禮貌和道德，並且也能使身體强壯。而對於我們生活上有很大關係，如出外露宿，不怕𤍠，不怕冷，不怕風，不怕雨，要吃飯只好自已煮。如果衣服破了要自已補，並且還要救人，募捐等事。一切都要自治不依賴</p>
<p>很重要，如果養成了習慣。對於自已一定有很大的益處。除這些有益處的事情外，還有一件很有趣的事，我想你必定歡喜的，就是出外旅行，穿了制服，不要旅費，並且人家還很歡迎，還能增加許多見聞和知識，是多麽的快樂啊。</p>
<p>我們要救國，當然有很多方法，但是如果將來要收回失地，定須從幼時做童子軍做起，因爲我們必須有健强的體格，才能擔荷救國的重任，姊姊！你快些來加入吧！祝你學業猛進！</p>

<h3 id="c184">「一二八」紀念 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 驊子</p>
<p>假定我是一個史官，而在今日記述「一二八」事件，那麽.該怎樣寫纔是「直筆」呢？</p>
<p>這一次抗日的功勞，先前的與論多歸之於十九路軍。然而時至今日，十九路軍的領袖們已爲「叛逆」而且失敗了，故論者又以爲這是「自毁歷史」。創造歷史者旣已自毁其歷史，則作史者似可省此一筆了罷。</p>
<p>然而不然。歷史並不是這樣可以任意增删塗飾的東西。歷史是以事實爲中心的，客觀的歷史的事實，猶如鐵鑄，不可改動。十九路果有抗日之功，則這一段歷史是永遠光輝的，至於牠的領袖們的後來的行爲則是另一種史實，並不妨害先前的史實的存在。歷史不管人物的功罪，只把事實的各個階段忠實地記載下來。</p>
<p>那麽，對於「一二八」事件，史家到底應該怎樣下筆呢？</p>
<p>「上海民衆抗日戰爭」——我以爲當如是立綱。</p>
<p>心細的人或能看出這倒是曲筆，有點像韓愈的「平淮西碑」，抺殺了將士的大功。但這種看法是錯誤的。韓愈將平淮西之功不歸李愬而裴度，而裴李是兩個人，所以發生公平與否的問題。但兵士和民衆是可以看作一體的。無論那一路兵士，當其承民衆的意志爲民衆的利益而戰的時候，卽爲民衆的武力，亦卽爲民衆的一部分。中國向來的軍士，多自外於民衆，民衆則岐視兵士，歷次的内戰，又只見民衆被兵士所殘殺，是故「有槍階級」與無槍階級之間，不但毫無關聯，且相對立。「一二八」之役，兵士纔部在民衆的立塲，與民族的敵人作戰。且據當日的抗日將領說：「上海孤軍抗戰之能維持到三十天，固然是爲了士兵的勇敢，而尤其重要的原因，却是民衆的實力上與經濟上的援助」。足見民衆在這次戰爭中的任務之重要。因此，說「一二八」之役是「民衆的抗日戰爭」，不但指出了牠的基本的力量，而且指出了兵士所以立功之道。這實在是最直的直筆。</p>
<p>「中國要反帝國主義的戰爭，必須士兵與民衆互相結合。」這雖是陳銘樞的話，但也是對的。不過站在民衆的立塲上說來，該是「必須士兵永遠成爲民衆的武力」。「一二八」留給我們的並不多。當此二週紀念之際，我們所認爲最可寳貴的，還是這一個敎訓。</p>
<h3 id="c185">英國史上一椿著名的人命官司一結束 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 鍊之</p>
<p>一四八三年的時候，英國發生了一椿奇怪的人命官：被禁在「倫敦塔」裏面的十二歲的孩子皇帝愛德華第五和他的十歲的皇弟樂克公爵忽然失踪了。起初大家都莫名其妙，後來才知道這兩位皇子是被人謀害了。這件空前的謀殺案引起英國朝野的驚駭。</p>
<p>約歷二百餘年之久，大家還找不到這兩個被害的孩子埋屍的地方。直至一六七四年，查理第二在位的時候，修理「倫敦塔」的工人們，在一個呌做「白塔」的樓梯底下，掘出一個箱子來，裏面裝着兩副骸骨。當時的考古學家（他們所根據的是什麽理由，我們全不知道。）以爲這就是那兩位被殺的皇子的遺骸。查理第二於是把牠移到威斯敏士特寺，埋在英國元首的墳墓傍邊。並且刻了一個拉丁文的墓誌銘，說這兩位皇子從前被他的叔叔李却第三監禁在「倫敦塔」裏面，後來這位狠心的叔叔又呌人把他們殺了。</p>
<p>因此，大家公認李却第三是這是椿命案的主使者。</p>
<p>其實，很早就已經有人疑心到李却身上。鳥托邦的作者湯姆斯摩耳曾經寫了一篇論文，叙述這件人命官司的經過，他一口咬定李却是主要凶犯。接着莎士比亞寫了一本著名的歷史劇呌做李却第三，把謀害的罪名也推在這位英皇身上。後來這椿空前的慘案漸漸引起法國人土的注意。法國十九世紀初期有一位戲劇家呌做加西美·德拉微尼，模仿莎士比亞寫了一部非常動人的劇本呌做愛德華。的兒子。另外一位同時代的法國畫家保羅·德拉羅虚，用同樣的題材，繪了一幅深刻動人的名畫，現在保存了巴黎魯佛美術館。</p>
<p>在歷史家裏面，也有許多人贊成這個假設，認定李却第三是這件謀殺案的唆使者。他們相信像這樣殘忍的事情只有他才做得出手。他曾用迅雷不及掩耳的手段結果了他的政敵亨斯丁士的性命；他曾利用一位流氓牧師否認他已經死去的哥哥的正式婚姻；他曾經爲要坐皇帝的椅子甚至誣衊他的母親，說他那兩位哥哥不是他的父親生的。這樣殘酷不講道德的人，殺兩個姪兒自是意中事。　　但是，不久就有一些人出來想翻這椿公案，替李却第三聲寃，因爲古今中外的歷史家最喜歡做這類「翻案文章」。他們說，現在我們研究這椿案件唯一的史料就是摩耳寫的那篇叙述；可是你們要當心！在這件謀殺案發生的時候，摩耳自已還是一個三歲的小孩，老年人的回憶是靠得住的嗎？並且「孤證」是歷史家最忌的，因爲没有方法辨别牠的眞僞。</p>
<p>戲劇家藝術家偏重人物的描寫，不顧歷史的事實，他們的話更不足爲憑，據這些歷史家的意見，這件殺人案是亨利第七，遲三年以後犯的。</p>
<p>因此，這件人命官司就打不淸了。可是這件事情却非同小可，因爲牠牽涉到英國皇帝的名譽。英政府想把牠弄個水落石出·所以去年七月間呌些工人到威斯敏士特寺把皇陵掘開，把那兩副孩了的骸骨取出來檢騐。著名的生理學敎授William　Wright,他同時是倫敦醫院的主任醫生，受政府的委託來担任這個工作。去年底在一個臨時召集的考古學家會議席上，Wright敎授將他檢騐的結果作了一個很詳細的報告。他說這兩副懚骼確是兩個小孩子的遺骸：一個十二歲，一個十歲。這恰是愛德華第五與他的皇弟遇害時的年齡。李却的罪案從此鐵一般的鑄定了。可憐亨利第七白受許多年寃枉！</p>
<p>我們應該注意：這個歷史問題。歷史家自已没有法子解决，結果請科學家來帮忙。這可見近代史學的無能，也許這就是牠的進步。</p>

<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>彷彿記得編輯先生命令我寫稿的時候是吩咐着要寫得趣味一點的，因此在拿起筆來的時候心裏就有點　　起來。趣味根本就是不容易的。要孩子哭的方法總比要他笑的方法多。世界上永遠不會没有從不嘆息的人，而從來不曾笑遇的人却多到無可計算。可見趣味的希少，製造者的艱難了。「趣味一點的」，我該寫點什麽呢？</p>
<p>·譬如說，在趣味底氛圍裏找點材料吧。但，一般有趣味底氛圍的，像電影，却天天有人在報上說着了，誰高興再來看我這非電影專家的胡謅呢。至如明星底頭髮，某小姐底眼晴，舞女的牙齒大腿等等，天天都有人在不壓求詳地說着。自已眞有點感到無話可說的恐慌起來。</p>
<p>眞的，「趣味一點的」，我該寫點什麽呢？</p>
<p>我對於娱樂底塲所旣不常到，而我也没有像林語堂老舍等先生的本領，可以把一件要哭的事情也把牠寫成使讀者發笑，如同卓别麟使觀衆發笑一樣。剛剛相反地，我却每每把一件有興味的人家想着要大笑的事情也寫成滿紙嘆息的聲音。你想，我還能寫點什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>並不是心裏藏着悲哀，所以手上便寫不出有趣的話出來。如其自已本來有寫趣味話的本領，那就不妨拼命把悲哀藏在心裏，且把有趣的話先寫出來。正如郎却乃扮演小丑時所說過的話一樣：「笑罷，把歡突的面具戴上，别讓旁人知道你發愁。」然而一個不會說有趣話的人卽使把笑面戴上也是呆板不堪，不能引人發生快感的。</p>
<p>强顔歡笑，眞是不容易的吓。在這些日子裏，憤怒就是犯罪，連着哭泣也是不狠自由的，祇有笑，雖然笑底動機是自自動與否，倒是另一問題。大家笑就好了。用笑底語調酬答，用笑底聲浪裝飾了廳堂的牆壁。吃飽了自然大家該笑笑，餓子，誰又不該笑笑呢！丁怪怪在他自吊的前一夜，還不是仍舊滿堆着笑臉向觀衆們哈哈大笑麽？笑是容易或否，那不必管，大家應該笑，却是鐵一般的眞實。</p>
<p>大家旣然非笑不可，那末被派作應付大衆的人就必得打起笑臉去向聽衆說點有趣的話出來，不幸的是，我却正是被派遣的一個。</p>
<p>我没有意思要理怨我們的編輯先生，他要我寫點東西自然不是因爲他想看的原故，他是要把給讀者們看的。而應該給點什麽東西給讀者，他自然是很有分曉的。如果是明明該給大衆以香烟，他却每人給一碗白飯，那眞是豈有此理得無可寬恕的。所以我也毫不責怪他的硬要向我索取香烟。然而我身上實在没有香烟，那有有麽辦法呢？想拿粉條呌他向讀者騙說是香烟，我却無此胆量。坍台我是受不起的。天下最難堪的事情莫過於說笑話而聽衆却了不笑。</p>
<h3 id="c187">懹鄕病 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>昨夜，我夢入家鄕。</p>
<p>（家在那兒呵！）</p>
<p>沿着一條港，順着流水走着。水是黄色的，載着靑色的樹葉子和椰子壳；流下去，流下去，没有盡頭的港水呵！　　可是我的家到了。　　就在有株椰子樹的地方，靜靜地，没有狗吠，没有鷄啼；只有，風吹動椰子樹葉：那麽熟的婆婆的音響呵！便加快了脚步走過去；低矮的亞搭屋蹲在樹下，芭蕉葉像把扇子的，把門遮了一半。到了門前的時候，我停下步來，側耳聽着，里邊一點聲息也没有！</p>
<p>那兒去了呵！家里有我白髮的祖母的；還有微笑的母親，天眞的妹子，這些全是我日夕惦記着的人，她們不也常常來信呌我回去麽？</p>
<p>（回來一次吧！祖母老了呢，她是那麽渴想着見你一次啊！）</p>
<p>悄悄地在心里背誦着寫在信上的幾句話；自責着不該遲延到今天才回來。現在她們都像離開了家了；我的心漸漸地不安起來，好久都没有勇氣舉起手來敲門。</p>
<p>終於用力把門推開了。</p>
<p>陰暗，潮濕，寂靜……　　「媽」</p>
<p>呌出來的聲音顯然顫抖得非常利害。一聲又一聲地呌着，没有回應。於是我慌亂了，我奔到母親的睡房去，床仍舊放在那里，桌子和椅子都不曾改變牠們的地位。我又轉到廚房去，火爐冷冷地，鍋子擱在一邊。在客廳上，那面大鏡子反照着薄暮的陽光，掛在壁上的字畫陳舊了些了；我在鏡子面前看見我自已：臉子是鐵靑的，消瘦的脖子和失神的眼珠子都不是在家時的模樣了！</p>
<p>於是又走出來，我大力地關上門，苦笑着。</p>
<p>（如果母親見到我這消瘦的樣子。………）</p>
<p>一年多的流浪生活竟把她的兒子弄成了現在的樣子；母親呵，你的心應該多麽的疼！然而有什麽法子呢？</p>
<p>天慢慢地暗下來，四圍是靜靜的。風帶着點冷意吹過來，吹到我的耳朶邊，彷彿有着母親的呼喚似的；我忍不住惝下了涙。</p>
<p>（哭着醒了過來。）</p>
<p>家在那兒呵！　　抺乾了眼角的涙水，躺在床上自個兒懹念起家鄕。</p>
<p>我的家鄉在亦道上。</p>
<p>但是又在有着和暖的太陽的南國。　　不曉得該不該回去，流浪人對家鄕是不會發生親切的感覺的。然而做了一塲鄕夢以後，我念着家了：每天，我用一顆孩子的心喚着母親，我祝禱着祖母的康健。……</p>

<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>「謝謝你，我該走了。」</p>
<p>女客說着　部起身來，再把眼睛貪婪地向四面望了望，好像凖備着後日能很容易地，再在腦中追想起來似的。</p>
<p>「您不妨多坐坐。」</p>
<p>她也站起來，把大衣取下來，替那女客穿好。當她走近女客的身子的時候，像是聞到了什麽氣息，使她覺得那麽好。她推想得到那原因，她知道爲了使生活還是安順地過下去，只有什麽也不說了。</p>
<p>她陪着女客走出屋門，纔要送到外面去，却爲那客阻止了。</p>
<p>「不要出來，外面這樣冷，凍着了不是好過的事。」</p>
<p>女客温柔地這樣說，給了她一名有生以來没有聽過的一個女人的體貼的囑咐。她順從地</p>
<p>回答着：</p>
<p>「好，我聽您的話，您慢走。」</p>
<p>她就佇在門口，看着女客走下台堦，突然間她想跑上前面牽住她的衣襟，親熱地呌聲「媽媽」。她不知道那樣她該有多麽大的愉快，她還没有呌過一聲媽媽的。可是她還是站在那裏，含着眼涙，望着女客模糊的背影漸漸地消失在暗裏面。她的眼涙終於流下來了，她用手抺着，轉回身去，又走回那空寂的廳裏。</p>
<p>她望望壁鐘，知道父親至多再有十五分鐘就會回到家中來的。她呌女僕去告訴看門的僕人，不要告訴老爺有一位女客來拜訪過他。</p>
<p>冬夜是更深了。　（完）</p>

<h3 id="c231">論「美國式的編書法」 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 凡</p>
<p>近年來，在我國的文化界中流行着一種編書法，是被稱爲「美國式的編書法」的。</p>
<p>這「美國式的編書法」的精神，是在把關於某一學科的各家意見羅列起來，不加批判，不作結論地編成一本「新書」。譬如，編或著文學概論一類的書吧，如果依據這「美國式的編書法」，便只是把黑格爾，叔本華，戴恩，居友，拉斯金，道甸，托爾斯泰，蒲列汗諾夫，弗里契，托洛斯……等人的文學見解並列起來就行了；至於他們底見解的本質如何，是否正確，則可不要管他。這便是「美國式的編書法」！</p>
<p>這樣的編書法，從表面看來，的確是很「客觀」的。把各家的意見都介紹出來，並不加批判，和作結論，一切都讓讀者自己去裁判，這還不算「客觀」嗎？「客觀」，不錯，但在這裏，却完全表現了以這種編書法來編或著書的人淺薄；不然，便是其對眞理不負責任。事實上，在每一學科中，自然有許多不同的意見存在，但其正中正確的與謬誤的都有。如果不能辨别其謬誤與正確，只是糊塗地把牠們並立起來，那就是表現自己的學識太差，根本還不配編或著書。如果自己旣能辨别其謬誤與正確，却還要故意把牠們並列起來，不加批判，混亂是非，那便是對眞理不負責任！同時，在這樣的編書法之下編成的書中，不僅是眞理與謬誤混淆在一起，矛盾百出，而且使眞理也會變成謬誤。因爲眞理旣與謬誤混在一起了，其本身就不能鮮明地顯露出來，就染上了謬誤的污點，結果也就和謬誤一樣。</p>
<p>不過，這「美國式的编書法」有兩種好處：第一，依此便可很容易地編成一本書，因爲這不需要什麽學識，只要有些參考材料，把各家底見解抄下就行了；第二，旣是要把各種各樣無論正確或謬誤的見解並立起來，那所編成的書一定字數很多，因而稿費也就很可觀了！</p>
<p>但是，有一點我們應該知道，就是美國是金元萬能的資本主義國家，這「美國式的編書法」實際上便是在　「金元」支配之下的編書法。</p>

<p>— 雲緋</p>
<p>由於家庭經濟的困難，素芬才在三年前被父親送進了産科學校。在父親的意思，現在雖然用點錢，但三年畢業以後，在家庭經濟上，也總可得到一些帮助了。</p>
<p>素芬總算是在産科學校裏住了三年，這三年經過了多少的變故：父親的去世，學費的累贅，母親和弟妹們生活的艱難，這一切使素芬在這三年中總算老練了許多。</p>
<p>現在畢了業，家裏一切都放在她頭上了。母親，弟妹和一家人的生活，都想靠住她一個人，最討厭的是，還要付還過去許多的債欵。</p>
<p>最初，她在母校的産科醫院裏面服務，這裏因爲是種義務性質，所以很苦，每月要上十五天的夜班，就是白天也要終日的勤勞。偌大的一個病房，住有二三十個産婦，但是，上班的時候却只有兩個人，病人的要茶要水，吃飯吃菜，眞是煩得要命，同時還要在産房裏面去接生。但每月却只有十五元的津貼。　　所以素芬爲了自己一家人的生活，服務了三個月以後她就亂了職，打算自己來當個助産士　　　　　　　　　　　　但是，困難的問題馬上就發生了，當個助産士或産科女醫，必須要掛個牌子，而且家裏還要相當的設備，譬如電話和診斷室。像素芬這樣一家七口擠在一個前樓上，旣無電話又無診斷室，自然掛牌子也就成問題了。像她現在的情形，卽或得到二房東的同意掛個牌子在門上，但是，這樣也恐怕不會有人來找她的吧。</p>
<p>爲要戰勝這種困難，素芬終於拿着她們校長的一封介紹信走到ＸＸ醫院去會見了某院長。</p>
<p>「啊！陸校長介紹女士在我們這裏掛牌行醫，我們當然是很歡迎的，不過，　我們邊地方很小，而且設備也很不週到，恐怕對於女士的業務上很有妨害，最好，女士還是另外找個較好的地方吧！」院長這樣說。說後並露出一副小心的笑臉。</p>
<p>素芬好像身上潑了一盆冷水，然而，她還是鼓起她最後的勇氣。她說：　　「陸校長曾託我轉達院長，望院長這方面特别設法，因爲，我現在實在另無辦法，所以我才來找院長的。」</p>
<p>「是的，不過！」院長似乎很躊躇的說：「好！我就很坦白的向你說吧，因爲你也不是外人，我們未嘗不可維持你，不過，我們這裏的開銷很大，你若要來掛牌行醫，「必須接受我們的條件。第一，你必須於上午八點鐘到院，午後八點鐘回　　　　　　　　　　　　　　我們供給你的午餐。第三，你每月接生收的入，應以五分之二作爲助醫院開銷，五分之一，作爲伙食及廣告之用，其餘的五分之二算你自己的。你自己斟酌一下，如果可以，自然很好，否則我們就不能帮忙，這都是完全看陸校長的面子的。哈！」</p>
<p>幾天以後，ＸＸ醫院的門外，多加了一個牌子：「産科女醫朱素芬」。</p>
<p>一月之中她的確很忙，有時接生又在夜半，馬路上寒風凛冽，素芬想起了已　的　　　　　　　　　　不禁要流下幾點淸淚。</p>
<p>一月過去了，兩月過去了，每月她也可以靠着醫院的招牌得到一百多元的收入，但是，除了五分之三拿給醫院面外，自己的幾十塊錢還要開銷車夫，藥品費和維持一家人的生活。</p>
<p>時間一天的過去，而素芬的生活也還是日處於掙扎與困難之中。她自己心中常常想：以前怕没有職業，幾年來的奮鬥，現在就是這樣，將來……將來呢？</p>

<p>— 李岱</p>
<p>Ｘ省ＸＸＭ山的煤鑛是頗爲著名的出産。該山的煤鑛工人們，是從幾方面來有：（一）由於當地的貧農或僱農爲了謀取一口飽飯喫而參加的；（二）說來有些近乎想像然而却是事實的，有些煤鑛工人是由單身行旅者，忽然被綁送來的。前者是有些做短工，只背運煤塊，所以比較算是自由一點，後者却完全是做奴隸，頂多是有一頓飯喫，並且是被覊押起來的。</p>
<p>在坑裏的工人分掘煤與運煤兩種：掘煤的人整天整夜蹲在坑裏敲着，身子浸在飽含着各種鑛質的水中，所以一個人至多不過二年光景，就皮膚腐爛死去的。因爲設備的不完備，運煤還是用人背出來。那背煤的人背上背着一大筐子的煤，彎着腰匍匐地爬出坑來，所以那些背煤的人們都成爲駝背了的。設或坑裏炭氣太重，那點着的燈把全個坑燒起來，人們被燒焦了是誰也不必過問，卽或就没有被燒死，但也會自己把心胸抓開來的。</p>
<p>在坑外面的工人，背上背着盛有兩百多斤煤的大簍子，是套在兩肩上面，因此，除了人家替你裝煤或取下以外，自己是無法也没有權利把牠鬆動一些的。煤要從坑口運到碼頭或堆棧，運的人是像騾馬一樣的被趕着跑，來又去，去又來，没有一些停止，連小便都不能放下來。因此有許多運煤的婦女，就只好用筍殼做成的管子來接自己的小便，於是工頭們就藉這機會大肆輕薄·甚而至於站着强姦的。</p>
<p>說到報酬，工頭們是隨便報告重量的。在剛好把秤鉈掛上去的時候，他就報出了重量。比如有一百斤的實重，他頂多是報出六十斤。如果和他稍微有點關係的人，他可以客氣些報出七十斤的。做了一整天，至多得到三四百文（該省一塊大洋要換二十四五千文）。三四百文是買什麽都不够的，於是工人們就不能不借債度日。</p>
<p>鑛主們是替工人們預備得非常週到的，他們開設許多日用品商店，而店裏所賣的東西比别的地方（鑛山以外）要貴上三倍。你如果要借錢也可以，也不用你還，你只作工就成，因此工人們不但是永還要作工，而且還永遠還不淸他們</p>

<h3 id="c234">怎樣學習國語？ <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 閭競明</p>
<p>現在學習國語的地方很多，如中華職業敎育社附設的中華職業補習學校，全國國語促進會附設的國語傳習所，以及精武體育會文事科的國語班……皆是。本文係爲要學國語没有機會進校補習的一般靑年從業員打算，所以祇述無師敎範的自學方法。</p>
<p>學國語當然先學國音，國音就是注音符號。注音符號共有四十個，分成三部：一爲聲符，計二十四個；一爲介符，計三個；一爲韻符，計十三個。學的第一個步驟，對於這些符號的「形」與「音」要認得淸楚，讀得正確。學者最好集合幾位同志，合買國音留聲片一套，依着符號的次序，細聽多讀。此外還要化些手寫的功夫，要練到一見某形，就能讀出某音；一聞某音，就能寫出某形，才算純熟！</p>
<p>第二個步驟，要明瞭聲符介符以及韻符的性質與作用。但是，只要知其然，不必定要知其所以然，換句話說，目的在能應用而已。若要細究其原理原則，就非知時期内所能辦到了。旣明瞭其性質與作用，然後再進而學習拚音。先學習雙拚法，次學習三拚法。拚法有數種分别，有以聲符爲綱，韻符爲目者：有以韻符爲綱，聲符爲目者；有以聲符或韻符爲綱，介符爲目者；有以介符爲綱，聲符或韻符爲目者。方法不論如何，排列不論如何，總得充分練習纔是。　　第三個步驟，就是練習四種聲調的讀法。四聲就是陰平，陽平，上聲，去聲四種。讀陰平的字，很平正，很自然，不用什麽氣力。讀陽平的字，要讀得很響亮，好像一口氣要從丹田裏提了出來一般。讀上聲的字，淺近的說，好像畫圏子一樣，讀起來要把調打一個轉彎一般。讀去聲的字，要用力下頓。這個練習，可買國音字彙一册，逐字研讀。各種聲調要讀得異常純熟，特别正確，到說話的時候，只要看字旁的符號與點號，自能說出很像腔的國語來。要知注音符號，只能表示國語的音；四聲讀法，才能表示國語的爲腔來。音凖腔凖，才是純粹的國語。</p>
<p>以上三個步驟，是學習國語的基本工作；得到門徑，學習說話，就不很難了。不過要一點一滈的學起，才有成功的可能。其法：每一個字，要照着注音符號和四聲的區别讀得很正確；每一個詞，也照着注音符號和四聲的區别讀得很正確。字和詞都能讀得很正確了，然後再進而練習句子，進而練習一節，進而練習一段，更進而練習一篇。到能成篇時，不但要能讀得正確，讀得自然，讀得流利，還要能照着語意，分出緩急抑揚的神情來，這才算大功告成。不過照此方法，至少要選讀近於言語自然的文章一二十篇，然後才可以憑空講自己所要講的話呢！</p>
<p>學習國語，如能照上述辦法，切實持久進行，必可保證成功的。</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>在縣裏中學校剛要畢業的時候，就猛然感覺到畢業以後的出路的恐慌。小學校的敎員位置早已充塞滿了，而大批的中學生更不斷的一年一年一批一批的從學校裏向社會上流去，自己頗感到爭不得一個位置以致讀了書仍要賦閒的恐慌。便向家庭要求，要到省城去進高中。滿以爲到了高中畢業定可解决生活問題，得有出路。於是乎盡量從各方找錢，結果到了省城。</p>
<p>在高中的頭一年倒還不覺得什麽，只上上課，隨便玩玩而已，但到了第二年心裏就又鼎沸焦燥起來。以前的自以爲不成問題的問題又懸在心上了。讀高中和讀大學的學生在省城裏是成千累萬的，那些畢業後的同學大部分是流浪着閒散着没有工作做。何况高中所化的錢更比初中多呢？心裏白天夜晚都恐慌得很。呵！到省外去留學回來便好了，資格來得更大，不難找位置的，何况外面的市面大，頂好就在外面找事做，進了省外的某某大學就滿可以解决出路問題了。便拚死向家庭榨取，向親戚借貸，再籌積更大的欵項，再追逐更大的遠景，於是在未畢業高中之前來到了上海，不久就進了上海的一間大學。</p>
<p>現在大學又快畢業了，我所追逐的憧憬，在縣裏在省城我所感覺的行將失業的恐慌，因這恐慌而被驅迫向前追尋的夢幻，現在又漸次漸次在我的面前消逝了。恐慌比以前更厲害，錢比以前用得更多，而前途比以前更渺茫，而且不能再有可以進一步的追逐，没有再大的幻想來遮蓋這一空虚無望的洞穴了。</p>
<p>出路在那裏呢？我找不着你了！　　我想同我一樣感覺的人是不在少數吧？「出路在那裏」成了一般人的問題了。起先是一步一步的向前追求尋覔，因而也帶着多多少少的希望，但是赿追尋下去便赿感到失望。同時社會上足以給人解决這問題的條件是更缺乏了：一方面加速的製造生産，一方面市塲不斷的缩小。整個的社會没有出路，個人又那能有出路呢？</p>
<p>了不過，也不能說就這樣追尋下去都完全要成空幻泡影。固然有許多站在個人的立塲，用個人主義的眼光來看這個問題便要感到無望，或者消極堕落下去，或者反其道而行的倒行逆施，但是由這一追尋而抓得了成爲這一問題之根本原因的人也是有的。祇要掘出了弄得大家没有出路不能生活的根源時，也就很可由此去更進一步找出路。整個的社會有了出路，個人纔有出路的。</p>

<h3 id="c236">跳繩 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 程希遠</p>
<p>現在讓我來介紹一種最簡而易行的運動法，是人人都能够做得到的，這不是别的，及是一件極普通極幻稚的遊戲——跳繩。　　跳繩，其實却是極好的全身運動，其功效與跑步相等。其不同之點在於：跑步的時候身子是向前進行的，而跳繩却保持身子在原處不動，而别部分的動作却完全一樣。</p>
<p>至於爲什麽要用繩，裝樣勢不行嗎？這理由很簡單：凡是一種運動，第一須要對牠發生了興趣（跳繩亦有種種技巧，可以激發起興趣），這才於身心有益；不然，則易生厭怠之心，致不能持久。</p>
<p>現在且把關於跳繩的種種，寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）利益—跳繩爲敏速運動之一，凡身體衰弱，不適於强力運動者皆可行此；能於短時間營甚大之運動量，增加肺活量，並促進諸　　組織之新陳代謝</p>
<p>（二）興—亦有種種技巧可以變化：如兩足相並而跳，兩手交义而跳，兩足前後開袴而跳，跑步式（一步一跳）跳躍，又每跳過繩二次，反手跳及其他種種。</p>
<p>（三）時間—公餘暇祇需十數分鐘之時間已足（飽食後應絶對禁止）。</p>
<p>（四）地點—祇需六尺之地，室内户外均可（惟不宜在空氣不潔之處）。</p>
<p>（五）—粗繩五尺（可以廢物利用）所費不過洋五分。　　　（六）—便用簡單，安置便當，且可以隨身携帶，運動時一人亦能舉行（如角力，球類等必須二人以上方可舉行），更無需人指導（如技擊舞蹈等須要有人指導）。</p>
<p>（七）—若有兩人，可以互相競賽以增興趣。譬如以跳到一千之數爲滿，誰先跳滿此數者卽爲勝利。如有多人則以分甲乙兩組對賽。</p>
<p>按：繩以棉紗及白蔴製的紧佳，蔴皮及棕　等次之，草繩不合用，運動器具店亦有出售，兩端有木柄，繩之長短可以隨便，裝潢精美，惟價很昻貴，約在一元以上。</p>

<p>— 盧福增</p>
<p>北平通訊</p>
<p>提起北平，誰都知道牠是我們歷史上的故都，是我們北方政治和文化的中心地方。這個地方遺留着我國封建的遺該和古老的東方文化底殘軀。那灰色的街道，矮的平房，古樸而直爽的風俗習性，和那簡單而純整的社會秩序，各方面都在說明這個灰色的故都之所以常常爲許多人稱讚的理由。</p>
<p>在這灰色的故都裏，自然也生活着各色各樣的人。許多達官貴人因爲喜愛這個環境底靜點單純，所以很多都幽閑的生活着。而同時，許多由過去官塲中衰落下來的遺老遺少，和成千成萬的貧民，却在這故都中不斷地掙扎着。</p>
<p>北平的天氣照例是很冷的。這幾天來，雪花是在四處飛舞。北海，中南海，什刹海等處的湖水，早已結成了一兩尺厚的水。寒風在空中挾着雪花索索的吹過這冷冷的都市，這北平，眞是一個冰天雪地的世界。</p>
<p>許多摩登仕女和少爺小姐們，屋子裏自然燃燒着熊熊的爐火，儘管外面的寒點已在零度以下，可是這對他們却是毫無關係。他們在這樣的寒天裏，有時也藏身在大衣或狐裘裏面，到北海或中南海去划冰，在他們的心裏自然以爲自已是在寒冷奮鬥了。</p>
<p>其實，在他們，這是一種很好玩的遊戲，寒冷對他們是没有絲毫損傷的。眞正和寒冷奮鬥的却是那成千成萬的貧民。</p>
<p>一到冬天，便是貧民們的厄運到了，好多的人，爲了生活關係，不能不去和寒冷掙扎。有職業的成天要在外面跑，能够住在家中的不見得能够有火烤。不過他們爲了生活也不能不努力的掙扎　　有些人爲要得到一點火烤，一早起來便提着一個筐子在垃圾堆中去尋找煤屑，他們在那炭灰中尋找别人家没有燒過的煤球或煤塊，拿回家中很節省的升着點點的爐火。但是煤球的煤毒是很大的，没有錢的人自然不願意把窗户打開讓冷風吹進來，所以，往往有因此中煤毒而斃命的，這幾天來北平報紙上差不多每天都載有這種事件。</p>
<p>還有一些人，每天却在冰上工作，他們把什刹海，北海等處的冰替冰廠挖起來埋在冰窑裏。他們爲要抵禦脚下的寒冰，往往用稻草把自己底脚包起來，包得很大，每雙脚包得比他頭部還大。　　另外還有一些無家可歸的乞丐和貧民，他們自然是更加可憐，每年都不知要凍死多少在街頭巷尾。但是，他們也有一種掙扎的方法。因爲北平的貧民窟中，有種貧民式的客店，這種客店住一夜只需兩三個大子。這是一間矮矮的破屋子，裏面排列着許多好像裝洋釘或水門汀的木桶，這说是當床用的。住店的人先把錢交與老板，然後跳在木桶裏蹲着，老板再拿一些破絮，鷄毛和紙屑，寒滿這木桶中的縫穴，這就當作被蓋。於是，桶中的人也可用這些鷄毛和紙屑來抵抗一夜的寒冷。</p>
<p>求生的慾望驅使許多的人們不斷地在艱難困苦之中生活，在這北平，許多人不僅長年的掙扎在飢餓綫上，同時，一到冬天還必須跑過這寒冷的死線。</p>
<h3 id="c238">小小專著幾種包工制度的内幕 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 王策明</p>
<p>（一）直接包工制</p>
<p>直接包工制，就是做的多，工錢多，做的少，工錢少，是資方和勞動者直接發生關係的。資方爲着多得利潤和避免勞動者偷閒—卽所謂揩油起見，在他們産業合理化分工過程中，預先規定了某種産物量的勞動價格，如紡織廠的布機間搖紗間和打包間分ＸＸ錢一疋布，ＸＸ錢一車紗等，如香烟廠的錫包間規定每包ＸＸ錢，工人爲了生活所迫，在工作時間上於是儘量的延長，什麽「過度的勞動」「戕賊勞動機能」等顯慮，都在飢寒交迫的苦海中消失了　　這種制度比較普通工制有利於資方，雖在勞工所得的工錢看來（包工工人每日平均可得七角，普通工人每日平均可得四角至五角），似乎普通工人爲高，但這不是勞動者（包工工人）的額外利益，而是加倍勞動力的結果，同時，在資本家方而却反右减少僱傭工頭的費用，理多的得到剩餘勞動。此種制度大半在紡織廠，香烟廠，織綢廠，橡皮廠等施行着。</p>
<p>（二）間接包工制</p>
<p>（甲）日工包工制—日工包工的工銀，是以每日計鼻，勞動者看不見資本家的，所與發生關係的是包工頭。然而，正因如此，他們的勞動力更不値錢，更比接包工工人要苦，因爲他們是受着雙重壓榨呵！而且，工作時間漫無限制，是完全要聽從包工頭的命令的，當工作緊急的時候，說不定每日要做到十二小時乃至十五小時疮們的工銀，普通每日三角左右，建築包工，大致每日二角，管飯不管菜，其他如木廠碼頭等包工工人，每天只有一串錢，如他們在所謂二包二包之下工作時，那更不堪設想了，因爲二三包都是要抽頭的呵！</p>
<p>（乙）年工包工制—此項包工制度，比較上更爲殘酷，大都在日本紗廠施行着。此項工人人數約佔全廠百分之二十五以上，其中大半是女工。工銀是以所數計算的，說來或許會嚇死你，就是每做工三年給與洋十元，甚至還有更少的，並有「賣身」志願書的訂立。至於工作時間，自然是更没有標凖了，如同出賣了的奴隸一樣地被驅使着。</p>
<p>这樣少的工錢，這樣苦后生活，而還能羅致這許多工人來的原因，就是包工頭拿「供給食宿」的口號號召成功的，但由此我們也可看出一般勞苦大衆「但求果腹」的慘狀了。</p>
<p>那末，此項工人的食宿情形究竟怎樣呢？在日本紗廠的工房統樓上，要住三十多人，什麽光綫空氣，那是談不到的，老紅糙米做飯，菜皮燒湯，還不够分配，早晚兩次稀飯，每人只給幾片蘿蔔乾了事，這是工人們所得到實際的待遇。如有疾病，除在廠内醫治，「聽天由命」外，就没有好的希望，因爲廠内有非至病到不能爬起的時候，是不准停工的規定的。</p>

<p>— 烈昆</p>
<p>「一二八」的兩週年紀念到了。</p>
<p>無論怎樣健忘的人，總不會忘掉婷一悲痛壯烈的日子。只要一提起「一二八」，誰都會想到那日本帝國主義之凶暴横蠻的態度，和那大砲飛機所給與我們之血的敎訓。</p>
<p>前年的今天，我們許多同胞正在刺刀和槍砲之下慘遭屠殺，我們英勇的抗日士兵正在火一樣熱烈的情緖中進行着浴血的戰爭。</p>
<p>「一二八」是悲痛壯烈的日子，同時也正是我們中華民族警覺的日子！</p>
<p>現在，時間已經過了兩年，我們所看見的仍然是版圖的變公與進攻的加緊。溥儀之稱帝，察東之告警，以及日貨之大量的傾銷，這一切最近的事變，是怎樣地震動着我們底神經啊！</p>
<p>隨着世界和平太平洋上風雲的緊急，更是說明：我們現在所處的地位，並不亞於兩年前的今天，隨處都是火藥庫，隨處都是未爆發的火山。</p>
<p>因此，我們在「一二八」二週年紀念的今天，想到我們同胞之被　慘殺，想到我們廬舍之被焚燬，應該是如何的憤怒與悽愴！</p>
<p>但是，憤怒是不够的，悽愴也只足以表示自己的懦弱！在這個時候，卽不是憤怒的時候，也不是悽愴的時候，是當脚踏實地的凖備着以歡迎未來時候！</p>
<p>有血有熱力的人們啊！刻骨銘心的凖備着吧！</p>
<p>名人演講</p>
<h3 id="c240">沈亦珍先生講「習慣與人生」 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 周鑑文筆記</p>
<p>什麽呌做『人生』？什麽呌做『習慣』？從廣義方面說，「人生就是生活的意思，生活須要生命。我們不能說衣服，桌子，筆……有生活，因爲牠們没有生命。我們可以說植物，狗，人，有生活，因爲牠們都有生命。所以没有和生命就没有生活。但是有生命與無生命不同之點是什麽呢？</p>
<p>桌子不能自動，放在那裏不動牠，牠就永遠是那樣，一定要受了外界的力量才會動。可是我們有生命的動物就不同了，我們能够自發許多的活動。活動才是生命的表現。所謂人生就是人活在世界上所有的活動加起來的總和。</p>
<p>把人生所有的活動分析一下，不外乎下面五種。第一是語言活動。凡是人都要講話，没有一個人在日常生活裏面不講話。講話就是語言的活動。這種語言活動在人生方面佔一個最重要的地位。第二是公民活動。從廣義方面說，公民活動就是指合羣生活各種活動而言，我們不能離開社會和人羣，那麽我們就應當注意社會生活的條件。再從狹義方面講，公民活動是指政治的活動，人民對於政治不能不參與的。第三是職業活動。職業活動佔人生很重要的一部份。第四是休閒活動。休閒活動，就是在無事的時候消遣的活動。如下棋，看電影，都是屬於這一類。一個人不能整天的工作着而没有休息，但是我們一定要在工作之後做正當的有益的休閒活動。第五是健康活動，就是指增進身體健康的活動。没有健康的活動身體就要衰弱，同時又要影響到精神方面，健康活動是不能不特别注意的。</p>
<p>其次，要說到什麽呌做習慣。我們可以說習慣是機械的動作。譬如我們走路，走得很自如，已經成爲機械的動作，這就是習慣。小陔子剛剛學走路的時候，必定要大人帮助他慢慢的練習才行，而且往往因爲歡喜走的缘故，受了許多苦痛和困難，甚至於常常跌在地下，哭得不休，這就是由於走路還没有成爲機械的動作。我現在且從生理學方面把習慣解釋一下。我們身體裏面有神經系統；在未學習以前，神經系統裏面彷彿馬路還没有築好。後來和環境繼續不斷發生關係，就得到許多經騐。這些經騐就使神經系統裏媆造成許多神經通路，好比馬路一般，起初阻力很大，費時較多，但是經長時間練習以後阻力逐漸减少，後來差不多暢行無阻，走起來很快也就是習慣養成了。譬如我們問「八乘八」等於多少，我們立刻回答「六十四」。在小孩子計算起來一定要嘴裏唸唸，手指數數，眼睛翻翻，因爲他們神經系統的道路還剛剛築起來，阻力較大，也就是習慣還没有養成。還有一點我們要明瞭的，就是在未養成習慣時，大腦非注意不可。我們的大腦彷彿是中央政府。脊髓是下級機關，彷彿是省政府。到養成習慣以後，脊髓神經就代爲管理，大腦可無須煩心了。</p>
<p>最後我們且把人生和習慣兩部份合併起來，講牠們的關係。簡單的說，「人生一切活動百分之九十九是習慣的動作。」你們把自已從早晨起來穿衣洗臉漱口，以及吃飯時的拿筷子送食物到嘴裏，和談天說地一切動作都是習慣。只要把自己從早到晚的活動細細考查，就可以明瞭習慣在人類生活中佔很重要的地位，人生就是習慣的綜和。習慣對於人生，旣然這樣重要，那末，我們應當怎樣養成習慣呢？我以爲第一要有深刻的注意。譬如你們現在眼望着我，耳朶聽着我的說話，嘴裏不發什麽聲音，這就是注意。注意是大腦的作用。注意力</p>
<p>愈大，習慣愈容易養成。第二要有充分的練習。習慣的養成也非經長時的訓練和充分的練習不可，因爲經過練習，神經通路的阻力才能逐漸减少，使動作成爲機械的，這是有實騐可以證明的。第三要有持久的毅力。若做一下子就中止了，是虎頭蛇尾有始無終的舉動。孟子曾說過：「人而無恒，不可以作巫醫。」所以我們做事情必須要有恒心。換句話說，我們要有持久的毅力。</p>

<p>船泊—好像水菓店中陳列着的水菓，總統號，皇后號，還有北洋，南洋，和長江……的輪艘。大的，小的，十隻，百隻，千隻。</p>
<p>江水不斷的怒吼，黄浦江中波濤的汹湧，好像是人羣的發怒，狂風吹動那軍艦上的國旗—英，美，意，法，日。　　在那岸上，高聳着建築物底斷岩，這是古典的，近代的，表現派的，立體派的，在斷岩中吐瀉着無數的車馬和人羣。匯豐，正金，花旗，匯理……。這些壓在我們四萬萬人頭上的怪物，時刻都在狂笑，猙獰。牠底巨口不斷地在吮吸着我們國度裏的鮮血，從那最近的地方以至那邊遠東南西北。</p>
<p>九層樓頂閃爍着火一樣的年紅廣告，白渡橋頭車輛震動着鋼骨發聲，外灘公園裏，成對的靑年男女在喞喞情話，而獨身者却在玩弄着自己底帽子。</p>
<p>街頭的紅綠燈，指揮這都市的行程，紅頭阿三手中握着無上的權威。他是都市秩序的維持者，他指揮着人的潮車馬的潮，指揮他們穿過了愛多亞路，穿過了南京路，最後，穿過了白渡橋，走向都市的腹心去了。</p>
<p>在白渡橋頭各國使館威嚴的站着，新俄的國旗，與德使館Ｘ宇字旗在互爭着雄長。遠遠的汽笛在呌，這是一種信號。</p>
<p>在那鋼鐵構成的外白渡橋上閃電般的駛着那電車，汽車，少爺和小姐剛從飯店裏面出來，他們心靈裏還在飄蕩着昨夜狂歡的餘燼。威士忌，却而斯登，克雷斯香烟和四七一一的雪花膏。温柔、甜蜜，燃起了他們心中靑春的狂燄。在汽車裏，狂吻着，擁抱着。</p>
<p>在那橋下蘇州河所湧出的船隻上，由内地不斷地走來許多古樸的人們，古樸的心。但是，這些古樸的心怎經這十里洋塲的暴風雨呢？</p>
<p>黄浦灘！就是這十里洋塲的尖端！</p>

<h3 id="c246">胡佛的少年時代（中） <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 伍慧芬</p>
<p>忽忽地地三年過去，胡佛是十七歲了。那時候美國上院議員斯丹福在加利福尼亞州創立了一個斯丹福大學，他就前去報名投考，不幸因爲自修數學理科，程度欠缺，没有考取。他正在怏怏不樂的時候，却遇到一位敎授，非常憫他的境遇，雇他做助手，並且呌他專習斯丹福大學的地質專科。</p>
<p>因爲他的境遇貧苦，胡佛只好自己工作來維持自己的生活。因此早起在農塲工作，或做報販，日中到大學去聽講，夜間替人家作苦工，每天如此，從没有間斷的。一直到他二十一歲的那年，他在斯丹福大學的採礦治金科畢業了。他雖然没有怎樣好的成績，可是他究是一個工學士了。</p>
<p>那時候照理他總該有一個職業了，可是因爲有加利福尼亞州大學出身的人與斯丹福大學的人互爭地位，加利福尼亞州的一帶礦山，所需用人材，都給加利福尼亞州大學的畢業生佔有了，而畢業斯丹福大學的，却尋不到一個相當的機會。胡佛的運命當然也逃不過，可是他並不以爲怪，他想；「技師做不到，礦工總可以做的。」於是他便入内瓦連礦山做礦工了。</p>
<p>他做的工作是搬運礦石，從坑内移至坑外，如果做得不好或太慢了一點，就要遭受坑内工人的責駡的。</p>
<p>幸而一個有才學的人不致終身埋身没，不到一年，他的學問被一個著名的礦山技師呌霍甫曼的賞識了，就把他介紹到一個有名的工業家爵寗那裏去。爵寗也認識胡佛的本領，再把他介绍給一位英國的富翁，這富翁正在西澳洲經營礦山，需要一個技師，來研究澳洲的礦山地質，那時候胡佛是二十三歲。</p>
<p>從此以後，胡佛的命運，便一步一步的拓展開來了，二年後，他從西澳洲歸來，卽與斯丹福的女同學亨利結婚。那時候因爲他歷年枞調查地質的成績卓著，聲名也因此大噪起來，不久，便受我國之聘，做我國的礦山技師長，在一九零一年就是他二十七歲的那年，又二次來華，計劃外國人投資企業的改造，從事鐵路港灣的建設，這樣以後，又受歐美的大資本家所經營的礦山團的請託，去調查全世界的礦脈。那時候胡佛不但是美國的礦山技帥，而且已經成爲世界聞名的唯一礦山技師了。</p>
<p>從胡佛的苦學苦行，一直到成爲礦山技師，這都是在世界大戰以前之事。至於他從工業界躍入政治界的途徑，是在大戰發生的時候開始的。</p>
<p>在一九一五年的時候，爲了紀念巴拿馬運河的開通，在美國舊金山開萬國博覽會，胡佛被派到歐洲勸令英，法，德諸國一同參加。不久，歐戰爆發，那時候正是炎熱的夏天，美國人赴歐遊歷觀光的，有十六萬人之多。歐戰開始的時候，他們都感到了相當的危險，不知怎樣回美國去，這成爲一個很大的問題。那時候胡佛便接受了美國駐英大使的委託，被任爲美國人民救濟委員會會長，担任辦理這件事情。胡佛運用他敏捷的手腕，竟非常安逸的把這一大批美國人遣送回國。因此，胡佛就非常受到美國人的崇敬！不但這樣，胡佛又進而救濟被德軍蹂躪得無家可歸的比利時難民，使一千萬比人得免於餓死之途。這樣的事情使歐洲人對美國有一種異乎尋常的感激，而胡佛的手腕，也給世界所公認了。</p>

<p>Chiang Orders Gathering at Designated Location</p>
<p>Wei Lihuang Leads Troops into Quanzhou City</p>
<p>(Xiamen) After the retreat of the remnants in Quanzhou, Wei Lihuang led his troops into the city. Jiang Dingwen, hearing in Anhai that the remnants of the 19th Route Army were demanding three months' pay, ordered them to gather at designated locations for further processing. The Fifth Army transported 2,000 troops, arriving in Xiamen on the 27th. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After the Northern Route Army ceased operations, and after the Shen district Mao Zhang telegraphed their separation from the puppet government, each unit received orders to cease pursuit. Song's division stopped at Anxi, Li's division at Tong'an, and the Ninth Division at Luoyang Bridge, encircling Quanzhou on three sides. Jiang Dingwen proposed three solutions to persuade officers of the 19th Route Army above the rank of battalion commander to leave their posts for reorganization, or face encirclement and attack. There has been no fighting in recent days, and negotiations are still underway. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Liu Kan in Quanzhou telegraphed on the 27th that Quanzhou was captured on the night of the 26th, seizing 4,000 guns, 30 machine guns, and 4 anti-aircraft guns. 20,000 rebels are being reorganized. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Postal and telegraphic services between Xiamen and Quanzhou have been cut off for days. On the 26th, information was received from Quanzhou dated the 24th that the 60th, 63rd, 78th, and 49th divisions of the 19th Route Army were gathering inside and outside Quanzhou City. Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, and Zhang Yan were all in Quanzhou. Wei Lihuang, commanding the 36th, 83rd, and Ninth Divisions, launched a fierce attack on the south side of the bridge from the north end of Luoyang Bridge on the morning of the 22nd, forcing a river crossing. The central army crossed the bridge in fierce fighting until the afternoon and seized the bridgehead south of the bridge. Zhu's regiment of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army retreated to the east gate of Quanzhou. Shen, Mao, and others sent Zhao Jinwen, the chief of staff of the 61st Division, to Luoyang to meet Wei Lihuang on the evening of the 22nd, declaring their defection and awaiting central government's handling. Wei ordered a temporary halt to the attack and sent personnel into the city on the morning of the 23rd to negotiate. At the same time, the central army withdrew from the south side of the bridge to the north side. From the 23rd onward, the attack was indeed halted. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Jiang Dingwen arrived in Tong'an, according to a report from Tong'an. The Third Division</p>
<p>advanced on Guanqiao, Xiyi, and Anhai on the morning of the 25th.

<p>The Airplane They Were In Arrived in Shantou</p>
<p>Forced to Land Due to Lack of Fuel</p>
<p>Shantou Garrison Telegraphed the Province for Instructions, Reply Telegraphed Ordering Close Surveillance</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The First Army Headquarters received an urgent telegram from the Second Independent Division in Shantou on the afternoon of the 25th, stating that according to a report from the garrison at the Qi Lu airport, an aircraft flew from the north and landed today. Those on board were Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, and the pilot. It was learned that they had taken a plane from Zhangzhou and intended to fly somewhere, but ran out of fuel mid-flight and were forced to land here. Personnel have been dispatched to monitor them. They inquired how to handle the situation and requested instructions. The headquarters replied by telegram, ordering close surveillance and protection to avoid any oversights, pending further instructions. The headquarters has been holding important meetings for days to discuss this matter. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is reported that Chen Mingshu's wife, Zhu Guangzhen, received a telegram from Fujian in Hong Kong on the 26th, stating that Li, Chen, Jiang, and Cai are still in Fujian. The central government has now cut off all transportation routes and is trying to leave Fujian from Gulangyu, transfer to Taiwan, and go to Southeast Asia. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Although it is widely rumored in Hong Kong that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and Jiang Guangnai have arrived there, Guangzhou is currently speculating about the whereabouts of the three men. According to the Chinese newspapers, Chen and others fled from Longyan to Shantou on January 25th, intending to take a boat to Hong Kong, but were blocked by the local military commander, who telegraphed Chen Jitang for instructions. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Zhaoxin and Luo Dexiang, pilots of the Fujian rebel air force, fled from Shantou to Hong Kong on the 26th and returned to the mainland by ship on the 27th. According to them, the remnants of the 19th Route Army are few in number and are now requesting reorganization by the central government, willing to work hard to suppress the communists to repay the party and the nation. There are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of Chen, Li, Jiang, and Cai. Some say they have arrived in Hong Kong, some say they were detained after their plane passed through Shantou, and some say they have taken a Japanese ship from Xiamen to Taiwan, transferring to Europe. The latter seems more plausible, as they are at their wits' end and must leave the army and go abroad. (27th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>To Persuade Sun Dianying to Stop the War</p>
<p>Zhu Shaoliang and Others Issue Circular Telegram Denouncing Sun Dianying</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Sun-Ma conflict has temporarily stopped. Sun's troops are now reorganizing around the forts of Tongji and Tongyi. The Ning army has also not pursued. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying has the intention of peace, and negotiations are currently underway. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The wired telegraph between Beiping and Dihua has experienced obstacles. Communication has switched to using wireless telegraph. Ma's troops began counterattacking Tongji and Tongyi forts yesterday and are fighting fiercely with Sun's troops (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Men Bingyue is currently in Baotou, contacting Lu Fengnian, the division commander of Sun's troops, persuading Sun to return to his original defense and await orders. After Sun replies by telegram, he will go to Wu Lin to meet, and Sun will inspect the situation at the front. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin telegraphed Beijing, saying that the Sun-Ma war had been stopped after issuing telegram orders to both parties, and has eased. He requested telegraphic instructions regarding the location of Sun's troops so that he could convey them to be followed. As for the troops that had already entered the territory of Ningxia Province, he had already instructed Hu Jiesan, Sun's representative stationed in Ping, to inform them to retreat to the vicinity of Baotou to await orders. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Hu Jiesan met Han Fuju today. Han hopes that the Sun-Ma conflict will be resolved quickly and has telegraphed both Ma and Sun, and also He Yingqin, to discuss effective measures. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sun-Ma conflict is escalating, and each side insists on its own story. A certain military authority said that the central government has already ordered both sides in the Sun-Ma conflict to cease actions and await resolution. The central government is very clear about the situation on both sides and is currently discussing a solution. The military authorities will meet with the representatives of both sides stationed in Beijing within a few days. Before this matter is resolved, they will continue to strictly order a cessation of actions. According to Liu Binghan, secretary of the 41st Army's office in Beijing, the army has already complied with the central government's order to stop advancing westward. Sun's troops going to Qinghai was an order from the central government to go and cultivate wasteland. Since the central government explicitly ordered it to exist for one day, it must go. Now they are obeying the order to stop the war. Once the central government determines a solution, they will still advance westward to preserve the authority of the central government. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Sun-Ma conflict, the central government has repeatedly consulted with the authorities in North China and the generals in the Northwest, as well as Jin. Sun's troops attacking Pingluo retreated north to the vicinity of Shizuishan. Sun's troops in Tongji and Tongyi forts are in contact with Ma's troops. He's representative, Men Bingyue, recently went to Baotou to advise Sun. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ningxia telegraphed on the 26th that after Sun's troops attacking Pingluo collapsed, they are now fleeing east in disarray. The Fifteenth Route Army immediately pursued them towards the Tongyi and Tongji forts, and the fighting was quite fierce. On the western front, the two sides are still in a stalemate at Ligang Fort. Sun's troops are extremely panicked because their rear is cut off, and the situation can be completely resolved in a few days. (27th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) Zhu Shaoliang and others telegraphed, (titles omitted): "Previously, Sun Dianying's troops were ordered to cultivate the wasteland in Qingxi. The national troops can be transferred anywhere, so Shaoliang and others have no room to intervene and no need to welcome or reject them. Moreover, the army expanded widely, exceeding the authorized size by more than double. Yang Houxiao and others, who were notorious bandits who had long harassed Gansu and Ningxia, were also recruited. Therefore, the people of the three provinces were both afraid of the increased burden and fearful of the bandit's trampling. Hearing of their westward arrival, they were terrified. Shaoliang and others initially tried to guide them to calm the people, but the crowd's doubts were difficult to dispel, as if a great disaster was about to befall them. They ran around and cried out, their condition was so urgent that they repeatedly appealed to the central government. They were gratified that they complied with public opinion and temporarily ordered them to stop advancing westward, waiting for Shaoliang and others to effectively relieve the situation before issuing further orders. The central government has never been neglectful of the army's concerns, and Shaoliang and others have never had any other intentions. However, the army not only failed to quietly wait for the subsequent orders, but suddenly took advantage of the Fujian incident to attack Ningxia Province. Although they claimed to be relocating to fertile fields, most of them did so via Dengkou, He Guaizi, Shizuizi, surrounding Pingluo, and disturbing Ligang Fort and Xiejiabao near Ningxia, all of which are under the jurisdiction of Ningxia, and not the roads that should be taken to relocate to fertile fields. Turning south and turning north, how can they cover people's ears and eyes? However, Shaoliang and others sincerely did not want to add to the central government's worries at a time when the national crisis was severe, so for half a month, they retreated step by step, hoping that they would repent, but the army continued to press forward, and wherever they went, they closed party headquarters, detained officials, released criminals, and looted the people. Reactionary slogans spread throughout the cities and countryside. Han Linfu and Xuan Xiafu, etc., who were important members of their party, presided over the army without any avoidance. Also, according to the surrender telegram of Xi Boen, the regimental commander of the army, Sun clearly declared when swearing in at the Three Sheng Palace that the 19th Route Army had Zhejiang and the communist army in Jiangxi had also entered Nanchang, and that the central government was shaken, and that our army should take the opportunity to advance westward, etc. At the same time, he arbitrarily appointed chairmen of the three provinces and issued attack orders. All roads know this, and it cannot be forcibly concealed. Not only did the army launch an attack, and the feud was opened by them, but their intention to plot rebellion and the evidence are obvious. Shaoliang and others, for the sake of the country's laws and discipline and for the sake of the security of the three provinces, can no longer remain silent. Moreover, Sun has always been provocative, or used dangerous words to incite the masses, and reversed right and wrong. Distant rumors are unclear and unjust. They will use the original commission to show the country the details. If Sun does not know how to repent and persists in going his own way, they hope that they will unanimously request the central government to denounce and punish them, so as to correct the national law and stop the source of chaos. This is the fortune of the Northwest and the fortune of the country. Special telegrams are presented to you. Please consider. Zhu Shaoliang, Ma Hongkui, Ma Lin, Deng Baoshan, Ma Hongbin, Ma Buqing, Lu Dachang, Ma Bufang, etc. respectfully salute." (24th) Print, (25th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Tibetan Representatives Petition the Central Government on Five Matters <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Welcome the Panchen Lama to Return to Tibet Soon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The representatives of the three major monasteries of Tibet, Cheng Wenyuan and Li Chunxian, went to the central government on the 27th to petition, earnestly requesting five matters: 1. If the central government is unwilling to abandon Tibetan territory and still cares about the Tibetan people, please ask the government to find a way to expel the villains in Tibet, improve politics, and save the Tibetan people. 2. Please ask the government to send a senior official with real power to escort the Panchen Lama back to Tibet, supervise the Tibetan government, and improve all politics. 3. Now that the Dalai Lama is dead, the Panchen Lama should be in charge of the religion and hold everything. The representatives sincerely welcome him to return to Tibet as soon as possible and hope that the government will comply with the wishes of the people and issue a clear order as soon as possible to promote his return to the west. 4. The senior officials entering Tibet must be given the power to investigate and guide all political, educational, military, and financial matters, and improve any bad policies at any time. 5. Tibet has now become a peculiar place, neither a country nor belonging to anyone. Ordinary ignorant people have long forgotten that it is Chinese territory. If the government does not take remedial measures as soon as possible, it is feared that a second Manchuria will appear in the near future, and even the empty name of being Chinese territory will not belong to our country. It is hoped that the government will be sympathetic to the suffering of the Tibetan people, compassionate to the crisis in Tibet, and quickly provide heavy assistance. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Panchen Lama suffered from a cold on the 26th. Dai Chuanxian called Chinese and Western doctors to examine him on the morning of the 27th. According to Liu Jiaju, the Panchen Lama's secretary, the Panchen Lama still had dizziness on the 27th, but could eat some noodles and would recover within a few days.

Zhang Futang's special police force has already been stationed in the county seat to await reorganization. It has not yet been decided whether they will be transferred.

<p>(Changchun) The communist bandits who occupied Hulin in eastern "Manchukuo" last year have since moved further south, and a few days ago even occupied Mishan, intending to take advantage of the situation to attack the Muling coal mine. The total number of these communist bandits is over 6,000, commanded by the Soviet Red Army, posing a threat to the border between Japan, Manchuria, and Russia, Manchuria. Therefore, the Sonobe, Nakamura, and Nishi units of Japan have begun to conquer from northern Jilin, so it is not allowed to have war in Chulin, Mishan and other places. In addition, rumors of military actions on the border have caused morale to waver in Muling. (27th Dentsu dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Reflections on the "January 28th" Incident <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Think carefully.</p>
<p>Two years ago today, war suddenly erupted in Shanghai. The cause of this war stemmed from the aggressive ambitions of Japanese militarists. Considering the situation at the time, although our nation's people shared the determination to resist Japan and possessed the spirit to perish together with the enemy, due to the weakness of our national strength, many harbored thoughts of forbearance and accommodation. Unexpectedly, Japan, believing in the incompetence of our people and the disunity of our hearts, initiated provocations, seeking to expand its economic influence and extend its political control in Shanghai. Initially, it threatened with empty words, thinking it could achieve the reality of war victory. However, the indignation of our people had reached its peak. Even if we lacked modern weapons such as guns, cannons, and airplanes to fight against them, we would engage in a desperate life-or-death struggle, even with bare hands, to fight for the survival of our nation. Therefore, disregarding interests and ignoring success or failure, we used a local force to fight against the organized army of an imperialist power.</p>
<p>Recalling the bloody battle of Shanghai at that time, we were truly overcome with anger and sorrow. Reflecting on past traumas, the bloodstains in Zhabei and Wusong were still fresh. The once prosperous thoroughfares remain fields of rubble to this day. The destruction of lives and the devastation of the economy, even after two years, feel like yesterday. After thirty-one days of fierce fighting, the 19th Route Army, the 5th Route Army, and the 6th Regiment of the Gendarmerie ultimately found it difficult to contend with the enemy's full national force with their limited troops and inferior weapons. Therefore, they had no choice but to retreat in the end. Given our nation's poverty and exhaustion today, and after the Shenyang Incident, when national strength had already suffered serious losses, we were well aware that we could not engage in foreign wars. The reason we could rise up and barely sustain ourselves in a struggle against a strong adversary was not solely due to the strength of the military, but also because of the national strength of our people providing support to the military. At that time, the enthusiasm of the general public in Shanghai to bravely transport supplies and the united spirit of the people across the country to confront the enemy ensured that the soldiers fighting on the front lines had no worries about the rear. They were able to fight desperately against a powerful enemy. This kind of situation was somewhat similar to the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army in the 15th year of the Republic. Therefore, although our country unfortunately lost the Shanghai war, the creation of a fighting spirit and the key to the rise and fall of the nation should not be judged solely on immediate victory or defeat.</p>
<p>In the year after the "January 28th" battle, Rehe was lost, and eastern Chahar was in danger. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but feel terrified. Japan is still becoming more aggressive in North China. Since the Shanghai war, our country has suffered repeated misfortunes, and difficulties have increased. The general urban industrial and commercial sectors are very weak, and the rural economy is facing the danger of not knowing if it will last until the next morning. Looking around at the world situation, we cannot help but be increasingly vigilant.</p>
<p>In Japanese propaganda, Sino-Japanese relations are showing signs of gradual improvement, and they will seek ways to resolve them in the future.</p>
<p>But in reality, they have not abandoned their traditional policy of aggression. The enthronement of Puyi is one example. As for the relations between the United States and Japan, on the surface, the United States is anxious to stabilize its domestic economic panic, and at the same time, it plans to trap Japan with a bloodless economic struggle, so it seems to be temporarily easing. However, it has taken further steps to build huge naval vessels and establish a powerful air force, which will inevitably use force as the final settlement. It is conceivable. Soviet-Japanese relations are fundamentally incompatible. The sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is only a temporary reconciliation, and conflicts of interest are increasing day by day, and it is bound to lead to a war. Moreover, the Anglo-Japanese understanding has long become a thing of the past. In the future, the relationship between Britain and Japan will also change from friendship to hostility. Our country is in this multi-faceted relationship. After repeated national humiliations, looking back on the past and looking at the present, can we not grit our teeth and continue to struggle to promote the spirit of our nation, so that the blood and tears of the past will not be shed in vain?</p>

Starting from the 26th night, temporary martial law was imposed on the Tangshan, Tang Gezhuang, Majiagou, and Linxi mines to prevent workers from taking action.

<p>Paris Informed sources here do not find the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Poland and Germany surprising. They say it is the result of a meeting between German Chancellor Hitler and Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski on January 15. It is generally believed that Poland and France are allied and friendly countries, and that improving relations with Germany will effectively promote peace, thereby obtaining new security guarantees to consolidate its position.

<p>(London) The newspapers here greatly approve of the union of Germany and Poland, because this move can show Germany's intention to be peaceful to the utmost. Even the Daily Leader, which has always opposed the German National Socialist Party, said that this German-Polish union can resolve the discord between European countries. Although France is slightly hit, it can also reduce many obstacles in the future. The Daily Mail also said that Hitler and Piłsudski signed this treaty to put Europe on the right track. The London Times correspondent in Germany said in a dispatch that the conclusion of a sincere and friendly treaty between the two countries is indeed an innovation. Although Germans still dare not believe that there will be no other deterioration in the future, in reality, Germany and Poland will become more harmonious as a result.

All circles in Berlin believe that this treaty is a success of Hitler's new policy, so it can be used to express Germany's repeatedly expressed sincerity to be peaceful and to have mutual understanding between countries.

<p>To Be Read to Parliament Tomorrow</p>
<p>(London) When Parliament reconvenes on January 29, British Foreign Secretary Simon will announce Britain's new policy on disarmament. This declaration may be based on the British disarmament draft, as the British government has never had any major deviations from it. However, it is expected that the government will revise it in light of recent events. Today, Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Secretary of War Hailsham, Secretary of the Navy Monsell, Dominions Secretary Thomas, and Lord Privy Seal Eden considered the final draft of the declaration in the Disarmament Subcommittee. The disarmament issue was studied very thoroughly at that time, as it is expected that when Parliament reconvenes, members of all parties will raise various questions about the government's policy. At the same time, all parties are also demanding that the government take action. Berlin has asked Britain to put forward new proposals to mediate and break the stalemate between France and Germany. Members of all parties in the country also advocate that the government should abandon its policy of quiet observation and offer advice on European affairs. Judging from the situation, Britain may advise France not to make the trial period a condition for any concessions to Germany. However, France's concessions may be subject to a requirement that Britain assume a new and practical obligation to prevent anyone from violating the disarmament convention that may be agreed upon in the future. However, the British public will strongly oppose this additional obligation. Another possibility is that Britain may propose that the various weapons of a defensive nature that are permitted be reclassified as prohibited weapons of an aggressive nature, to prevent Germany from having too strong military strength in the future when Germany is allowed military equality.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Mouchanoff will also stay in Rome to discuss with Foreign Minister Titulescu. The non-aggression pact between the Balkan countries will be signed on February 2 in the capital of Yugoslavia. Titulescu should recover by then, and he will meet with the foreign ministers of Turkey, Greece,</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, and other countries. As for Bulgaria, it is free to add this pact within a certain period of time in the future. It is reported that the future non-aggression pact in the Balkans stipulates that the contracting countries guarantee each other's territorial integrity and secondly, guarantee the security of each other's borders.</p>
<p>The reason why Bulgaria opposes the new pact is related to these treaties. The Bulgarian government is originally dissatisfied with the borders set by the peace treaty. The newly signed Balkan non-aggression treaty is like adding another layer of protection to the peace treaty, so Bulgaria cannot agree to it. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e48">All Europeans are Paying Attention to the Conflict Between Hitler and Goering Incompatibility of Views on Restoration and Austria Great Impact of Two Strongmen Not Coexisting <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(London) German Chancellor Hitler and Prussian Prime Minister Goering are both the most determined people in modern Europe. The world regards Goering as Hitler's right-hand man, but recently the three have had disagreements and repeated quarrels. This is the latest scene in the National Socialist Party, and all Europeans are paying attention to the outcome.</p>
<p>It is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The points of disagreement between the two are as follows: (1) Germany wants to make Austria a National Socialist state, and must first remove Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. Hitler recently saw the great powers expressing sympathy for Austria and wanted to slightly change his policy towards the Austrian Chancellor, but Goering strongly opposed it, putting Hitler in a dilemma. (2) Goering seems to want to restore the royal family and give them back political power, but Hitler does not want to abolish the throne and restore it, and to reduce his own authority, so he opposes restoration with all his might. (3) Dimitarov, a Bulgarian Communist,</p>
<p>was previously suspected of arson in the Reichstag, and although he has been acquitted, he is still imprisoned. Hitler wanted to release him,</p>
<p>even though Dimitrov may make powerful propaganda against the National Socialist Party in other countries, it is impossible to prevent this and imprison him forever, but Goering does not advocate this. (4) Hitler's proposed new German constitution wants to reduce the land of Prussia, which is also something that Goering cannot agree to. (5) On the issue of religious disputes, Hitler advocated that Müller, the head of the Protestant Church of Germany, should take a leave of absence and temporarily have others handle religious improvement matters to avoid political forces, but Goering replied, "When we put on brown shirts, we are neither Christians nor Catholics." Goering advocated that religion should obey the state, so the reconciliation of religious disputes has been difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>All five of these points are the reasons why Hitler and Goering are gradually becoming incompatible. Although the majority of the German people support Hitler, Goering is not without followers. If the conflict between the two intensifies, there will be very important developments in Germany. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Last night, when the National Military Officers' Association was celebrating the 75th birthday of the deposed emperor, suddenly heavy trucks carrying police and stormtroopers sped to the scene, surrounding the venue. According to the old custom, all the officers had to stand up to raise a glass to bless the deposed emperor at the sound of the twelve o'clock bell. At this time, the police rushed in, ordered everyone to raise their hands, and ordered the officers in imperial military uniforms to go home immediately. The celebration was not held. In previous years, this celebration was not restricted. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>Both Imports and Exports Showed an Increase</p>
<p>(Washington) According to figures released today, American exports and imports both increased in 1933. Imports for the year totaled $1,449,000,000, an increase of $126,000,000 over 1932. Exports totaled $1,675,000,000, an increase of $64,000,000 over 1932. Exports for December were valued at $192,000,000, an increase of $8,000,000 over November. Imports totaled $133,000,000,</p>

<p>(Washington) The Senate today took decisive action on the President's monetary bill, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury, by a vote of 54 to 36, to manage the equalization fund independently, rejecting an amendment to organize a five-member committee of the Banking Committee to manage the fund, and passing an amendment to limit the period of operation of the equalization fund and the President's power to reduce the value of the dollar to two years, but extendable to three years. During today's debate, Democratic Senator Pittman advocated expanding the President's powers to issue silver certificates in exchange for silver bullion for use in place of silver dollars. Republican Reed denounced the potential impact of the monetary bill, saying the equalization fund would create an artificial market for government bonds and keep bond prices at a fixed level. Democrat Robinson said Reed's proposal was merely a continuation of former President Hoover's "laissez-faire" policy. Democrat Bailey said the bill was aimed at protecting the United States from currency wars with countries with depreciated currencies and reducing the burden of debt on the American people. Senator Borah advocated restoring silver coinage to expand the world's monetary standard, saying gold was scarce and unevenly distributed, and the monetary bill would allocate gold to address this problem, but would not benefit the rest of the world.

<p>Army Minister Hayashi Says Japan and Russia are Both Adopting Defensive Armaments</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 27th, Seiyukai member Shinya Uchida raised questions regarding arms reduction, saying that the Japanese arms reduction proposal submitted to the Geneva Disarmament Conference the year before last December stated, "This arms reduction proposal is a suitable case to replace both the Washington and London Treaties." In the future, when the disarmament conference is held in 1935, Japan will inevitably be bound by it, so why does the government not withdraw this proposal? Navy Minister Osumi</p>
<p>replied to this, saying that this proposal has not been included in the discussion topics of the disarmament conference, and there has been no opportunity to clarify the content. Various countries have repeatedly put forward proposals and changed their content each time, so Japan can also follow their example and change the content. We, as the Navy Minister, have just realized the government's opinion that Japan will not be bound by Japan's previous proposal at the 1935 disarmament conference and intends to submit a new arms reduction proposal demanding changes to the ratios. (Jiji News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives opened the general budget meeting at 10:00 this morning. Seiyukai member Shinya Uchida continued to question the naval issue because yesterday's questioning was incomplete. Uchida asked, "I think the crisis of 1935 is due to the result of the London Treaty. How will the government change?"</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi replied, "The direct cause does not seem to be the result of the London Treaty, but it can be said to be one of the causes of the crisis." Uchida then advanced his argument, discussing the impropriety of implementing tax cuts based on the London Treaty and the attitude of the army during the major reorganization at the time, saying, "As a result of the establishment of the London Treaty, the government reluctantly implemented a tax cut of 13 million yen, and therefore today it has to implement a 120 million yen naval replenishment plan to compensate for the defects of the treaty. According to the verdict of the May 15th Incident, the young officers said that the defects of the London Treaty should be the responsibility of the political parties. May I ask whether the Navy Minister admits that the responsibility lies with the political parties?"</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi replied, "The political parties have no responsibility, and it would have been better if the tax cuts had not been implemented."</p>
<p>At this time, members of the Minseito party loudly criticized the Navy Minister's statement that tax cuts were not good. Navy Minister Osumi continued, saying that the tax cuts were implemented before he took office as Navy Minister, so he withdrew his opinion on this issue. The naval authorities only have one way to clear the past and do their best for the future.</p>
<p>After the Navy Minister's reply, Uchida's argument became more specialized, and he questioned what the ratio of naval power between Japan and the United States would be after the completion of the second replenishment plan, and mentioned the Washington and London Treaties, saying, "According to American newspapers, the Navy Minister's opinion is that Japan is dissatisfied with the ratio of the naval treaties and therefore demands revision. Does the Navy Minister admit this?"</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi replied, "I admit it."</p>
<p>Uchida asked, "Since you are dissatisfied with the ratio issue,</p>
<p>what is the Navy Department's policy on issuing a notice of termination of the two treaties within this year?"</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi replied, "After investigating all parties and the situation within this year, we will decide on a policy."</p>
<p>Uchida's questioning ended here. Then, Minseito member Masatoshi Takagi questioned the Foreign Minister and asked what the Foreign Minister's opinion was on the ratio issue.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied, "The issue of maintaining the average national defense with the ratio issue has only been experienced for a dozen years since the beginning of mankind. It cannot be said whether the issue of ratio limits is appropriate or not." Takagi did not change his line of attack and pressed the Foreign Minister, saying, "Then does the Foreign Minister have any intention of demanding a change in the ratio?"</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied, "My reply to this is the same as Navy Minister Osumi's</p>
<p>reply."</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi also stood up and replied, "The naval authorities intend to demand a revision of the ratio." Thereupon, members of both the Seiyu and Minsei parties requested that reference materials be submitted. The chairman adjourned the meeting at 11:30.</p>
<p>The budget meeting reopened at 1:16 p.m. Seiyukai member Shigemasa Sunada was the questioner. Sunada focused his questioning on rural issues, raising issues such as the current situation relief projects and the rural issues of the cabinet meetings. Then, he spoke about the economic conditions of farm households, saying, "According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the expenditure of rural villages exceeded income by 129 million yen in 1932 and 85.7 million yen in 1933. Although the government has reduced taxes, I am afraid it cannot compensate for such a huge number. The fundamental solution is only to raise the price of agricultural products. What is the government's view?"</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Goto replied, "The government is considering the issue of raising the price of agricultural products."</p>
<p>Sunada said, "The rice control law does not have the effect of raising the price of rice."</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Goto replied, "Since the government implemented the rice control law, the price of rice has been stabilized."</p>
<p>Sunada then criticized the government for not having a fundamental policy to deal with excessive rice production and mentioned issues such as silk and raw silk, and warned the government to establish a fundamental policy for sericulture as soon as possible. Then, he questioned the financial authorities, "What kind of response does the government have to the international situation of forming an economic alliance?"</p>
<p>After several debates with Finance Minister Takahashi, Sunada stopped questioning. Next to take the stand to question was Minseito member Katsu Kawasaki. Kawasaki questioned the newly appointed Army Minister, Korekiyo Hayashi, about the reason for reducing the Manchurian Incident expenses and said, "From which year will the name of the Manchurian Incident expenses be abolished as special expenses and made ordinary expenses?"</p>
<p>Army Minister Hayashi replied, "The suppression of bandits in 'Manchukuo' is no longer as intense as before, and the use of bullets has been greatly reduced, so the incident expenses have been reduced. I cannot say from which year the abolishment of special expenses will be abolished."</p>
<p>Kawasaki asked, "Which country will bear the national defense expenses of Manchukuo in the future, Japan or Manchukuo?"</p>
<p>Director of the Deep Reason Bureau, Onodera, replied, "It is not convenient to say this."</p>
<p>Kawasaki then questioned the issue of the security burden of the Manchurian railways, the security improvement expenses after next year, and the relationship between Japan and Russia on the Russo-Manchurian border, etc.</p>
<p>The Army Minister replied, "Although there are various rumors, there is no reason for an incident to occur between Japan and Russia. Japan adopts defensive armaments, and so does Soviet Russia."</p>
<p>Kawasaki then turned his questioning to Home Minister Yamamoto and Finance Minister Takahashi, raising the issue of the current situation relief expenses and financial issues, saying, "If Japanese finance is promoted with today's policy, I am afraid of its future. The Finance Minister intends to establish a financial plan with natural revenue increase as the source of funds. Will this not destabilize finance?" Finance Minister Takahashi replied, "I do not intend to reform finance with natural revenue increase as the source of funds. I said that when there is a time of natural revenue increase, there will be an opportunity to establish tax increases or other reforms." At 6:00 p.m., the Speaker announced the adjournment.

<p>Hirota's Speech and Araki's Resignation</p>
<p>Insufficient to Prove Change in Japanese Policy</p>
<p>(Moscow) The newspaper Pravda commented on the speech of Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota, saying that Hirota obviously wanted to evade the responsibility of the Japanese government's forcing Soviet-Japanese relations to become tense by saying that the Soviet Union's position had changed, and at the same time wanted to place this responsibility on the shoulders of the Soviet government with peaceful rhetoric. The Soviet Union's peaceful policy has not changed in the slightest. What should be regretted is that Hirota's speech and General Hayashi's succession to Araki as Army Minister have not shown any change in the Japanese government's foreign policy that can truly maintain peace. If Japan wants to maintain the steps taken by the Soviet government and try to eliminate the insecure diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, then its government's foreign policy must have this kind of change, that is, it must not allow the plan to invade the Soviet Union to be realized, and this plan is being planned by the Japanese military and others who support anti-Soviet aggressive adventures. Pravda further commented on Araki's resignation, saying that we have no reason to believe that Araki's resignation and General Hayashi's succession are a change in the main trend of Japanese foreign policy. Hayashi's assumption of the post of Army Minister is not so much a positive sign on the basis of peace as it is a negative sign. Pravda further quoted the remarks of participants in the war symposium organized by the magazine "Hinode," pointing out the idea of ​​a sudden strike held by the leading military circles, and General Hayashi is a member of this leading military circle, so the latter's assumption of the post of Army Minister has not shown any improvement in Japanese foreign policy.

<p>Japanese Ambassador Raises Questions</p>
<p>Rome Dispatch The Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Matsushima, met with Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday and said that he was instructed by the Japanese government to ask Mussolini to explain the political significance of his article "Far East". The article was written by Mussolini for the American news agency and was published in the "Italian People's Daily" on January 7. According to the Japanese side, Mussolini's arguments about Japan in the article seemed unreasonable. The gist of the article was that after Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it could do whatever it wanted in terms of peace or war, and that there was indeed a danger of war at present. Therefore, since the article was written by the Italian Prime Minister, it had a great impact, and Italian newspapers expressed more opinions based on this, taking the same tone as the Italian Prime Minister, and even Italian official documents often revealed this view, such as the naval budget report submitted by the Senate, which had a similar tone. However, Ambassador Matsushima did not mention this kind of document related to Italian internal affairs when he met with Mussolini, only saying that the economic relations between Italy and Japan were quite good, and there was no political dispute between the two countries. Italy has less relationship with the Far Eastern issue than other European countries, but now it wants to occupy the leading position in the European anti-Japanese imperialism movement. What is the reason? Italian newspapers deliberately used the dangerous rhetoric of "Yellow Peril" to sensationalize and arouse the spirit of cooperation among European countries. The Japanese ambassador specifically questioned the Italian Prime Minister on this point. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>New Delhi It seems that the Indian government has recently raised import duties on rayon. On the 26th, the Commissioner of Commerce, Bhore, notified the Japanese representative, Sawada, that he intends to submit a bill to the Central Legislative Assembly in early February to raise rayon tariffs to protect the Indian domestic cotton industry, but it is not yet clear what the amount of the increase will be. (Jiji News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>New Delhi The Japanese market was shaken by rumors that India would raise import duties on rayon. Representative Sawada visited the Indian Commissioner of Commerce, Bhore, on the 26th to inquire about this matter. After Bhore acknowledged this fact, he expressed the Indian government's opinion that the Indian cotton industry has recently been oppressed by rayon, and he intends to submit an import tariff bill for rayon products to the Central Legislative Assembly on February 5. After receiving this definite answer, the Japanese delegation suddenly expressed a tense atmosphere. The director of the Trade Bureau, Terao, postponed his departure for New Delhi. India suddenly raised tariffs on groceries last time, and now it has done this again. The Japanese delegation believes that India is not sincere, so it has decided to immediately consult with the domestic government on countermeasures. (Jiji News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Kobe According to a telegram received by local traders, when the issue of raising tariffs on groceries became a problem, the Indian parliament further increased the import of silk fabrics for the purpose of increasing tariffs by 50% to 60%, a high rate that can be prohibited, which is extremely noteworthy. The industry immediately informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this matter, and it was heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also received a telegram, but the additional tax of 50% to 60% plus the current rate reached a high rate of 100% to 110%. Japan's exports of silk fabrics to India can only be completely wiped out. The silk fabric export industry association immediately telegraphed the director of the Trade Bureau, Terao, who was detained in India, to report the truth, and waited for a reply telegram before discussing emergency countermeasures. Also, the export amount of silk fabrics to India last year reached 15 million yuan, a sharp increase of 50% compared to the previous year's 10 million yuan. (Denchu, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Soviet Russian Communist Party Congress Stalin Deeply Supported by the Masses Molotov Speaks on Socialism (Moscow) The Seventeenth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party opened yesterday at the Kremlin. More than two thousand delegates attended, representing party departments across the federation. When Stalin entered the hall, he was greeted with enthusiastic applause that lasted for quite some time. All the delegates rose to pay their respects, shouting loudly in acclamation. Molotov delivered the opening address, and amidst enthusiastic cheers, the congress elected the presidium, which included Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Kalinin, Kirov, Kossior, Postyshev, and Lenin's widow. Subsequently, Stalin presented a report on behalf of the Central Executive Committee, which was again met with enthusiastic applause. The report lasted for five hours and was repeatedly interrupted by applause. At the conclusion of the report, there was a long period of applause, followed by the congress delegates singing the Internationale. (TASS dispatch of the 27th) (Moscow) Molotov, representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered the opening address at the congress, stating, "Since the last congress established the development of a force to thoroughly eliminate capitalist elements as the primary goal, a relatively short period has passed in an instant. During these years, the intense struggle of the working class against socialism has never ceased, and our socialist construction has achieved tremendous victories. Our party, under the banner of developing offensive forces, has united the working class and the peasant masses, leading them to thoroughly complete the aforementioned goals. Despite the croaking of our enemies predicting the inevitable failure of the Five-Year Plan, our party was able to complete it thoroughly within four years. All the great industries in our country today, along with their installed technology and the machines they can produce, will in the future be able to manufacture all products to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy for technical equipment and to develop our national defense capabilities." The Second Five-Year Plan We have already launched the struggle to realize the Second Five-Year Plan. At this congress, regarding the Second Five-Year Plan, which is a five-year plan to build a socialist society without classes, we must make a final judgment. The convening of this congress coincides with the final victory of collective farming throughout the federation and the gradual elimination of rich peasant elements. Last year's unprecedented harvest is a testament to the great success of agriculture. An affluent and cultured life is already within reach, and tens of millions of collective farmers are beginning to realize this kind of life. We still have some problems to be solved. We still have backward economic sectors whose command of new technologies and industries is insufficient. However, it is evident that the Soviet state is always able to overcome all the difficulties it encounters and can continuously make rapid economic and cultural developments to bring greater prosperity to the working masses. The fundamental difference between the Soviet state, which is building socialism, and the bourgeoisie, which maintains the capitalist system, lies in this." Molotov on the Prosperity of the Soviet Economy Molotov contrasted the growing prosperity of the Soviet economy with the economic panic of capitalist countries, saying, "The facts of every day are sufficient to show the increasingly greater power of countless socialist forces in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, there is the world economic crisis and the increasingly surging revolutionary struggles of workers against capitalism and bourgeois dictatorship. These facts provide countless ironclad proofs of the impending collapse of the capitalist system of the bourgeoisie. The reason why the enthusiasm of socialist builders in our country is growing is also due to this. The working class and the masses of collective farmers express their special enthusiasm for the Seventeenth Congress of our party. All of this demonstrates the efforts and firm determination with which millions of workers and collective farmers are fighting for the complete victory of socialism in our country. The congress will mobilize the masses with new and higher standards, uniting them around the Bolshevik Party and around our victorious leader and organizer, Comrade Stalin." Molotov continued, "This congress will win enthusiastic responses in the hearts of millions of proletarians and oppressed peoples in countries outside the Soviet Union. We tell them that our struggle to win the victory of socialism is inextricably linked to the anti-capitalist revolution of workers around the world. Preparing for a Pressing Opportunity Molotov further stated, "In recent years, we have considered the necessity of an increasingly pressing war crisis in many situations. At present, especially regarding the situation in the Far East, we must strengthen our vigilance and preparation to safeguard the great victory of the October Revolution. While we resolutely pursue a policy of peace and promote peaceful cooperation with other countries, at the same time, we must pay special attention to strengthening the combat power of our glorious Red Army. The convening of this congress coincides with the tenth anniversary of the death of Lenin, the great leader and organizer of our party and the socialist revolution. Only by relying on the revitalization of Lenin's legacy and the implementation of Lenin's policies can our party achieve great victories. The greatest contribution to the implementation of Lenin's legacy in practice is our Central Committee, and Comrade Stalin, the faithful successor of Lenin's policies, is the leader of the Central Committee. Solving the problems of struggle and organization in socialist construction and strengthening the party's leadership in construction work are the most important issues of the congress," he said.

According to reports, Reynaud was a key figure for Premier Doumergue. In the past two days, due to the Bayonne bond corruption scandal, the Premier has been under heavy attack in the Chamber of Deputies. The cabinet has scheduled a meeting for today to discuss the issue of whether to stay or leave. It is now feared that Reynaud's resignation may precipitate the resignation of the entire cabinet. (National Telegram of the 27th) (Paris) This morning, President Lebrun discussed the current situation faced by the cabinet with Premier Doumergue. The cabinet has scheduled a meeting for the afternoon. It is reported that the cabinet will either resign en masse or seek another justice minister to replace the already resigned Reynaud. If the second step is taken, Doumergue will attend the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday to handle the debate on the Bayonne fraud case. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th) (Paris) This morning, Justice Minister Reynaud submitted his resignation to Premier Doumergue. After receiving the resignation, the Premier immediately convened his cabinet for a meeting at 4 p.m. Finance Minister Germain-Martin went to the State Council at 9:45 a.m. to meet with Premier Doumergue and left at 11 a.m. Premier Doumergue then went to the Presidential Palace to meet with President Lebrun, and then went to the residence of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Bouisson for talks. (Havas dispatch of the 27th) (Paris) A political storm is brewing in France. According to authorities today, Justice Minister Reynaud has not resigned, and the government will confront the Chamber of Deputies next Tuesday. It is not yet known whether Reynaud has changed his mind or whether Premier Doumergue has not accepted his resignation, but it is widely expected that a great uproar will occur when the Chamber of Deputies convenes next week. Reynaud was involved with a trust company several years ago, and its founder, Salsagos, was later accused of violating company law. This case has been pending for five years, and Reynaud has been criticized by the general public. Reynaud initially resolved to leave the government to clear his name, but has not done so until today. At the same time, six defendants in the Stavisky affair, including Semirowitch and Xavier, were sentenced to four years in prison today. Xavier was present in court, while Semirowitch was sentenced in absentia. The third defendant, Condi, is seriously ill. The remaining three defendants, including Stavisky, have all passed away. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th) (Paris) For several days, right-wing and socialist newspapers have attacked Justice Minister Reynaud for previously serving as a director of the Salsagos Trust Company and demanded Reynaud's resignation. It is now reported that Reynaud will step down himself to regain freedom of action. It is also reported that Premier Doumergue advocates the resignation of all cabinet members, and after resigning, he is unwilling to form a cabinet again. It is generally believed that President Lebrun will ask Radical Party leader Herriot or Army Minister Daladier to serve as premier. Some members of the public intend to hold demonstrations in front of the Chamber of Deputies and various departments, which were dispersed by the police. Later, some people demonstrated on prosperous streets, and the police came out to suppress them and arrested several people, with several people injured. (Havas dispatch of the 27th) Singapore Naval Conference Discusses Malayan Defense Sarawak King Attends Meeting Singapore Authorities at the Singapore Naval Conference are still keeping things secret. It is said that the defense of the Malayan coast was discussed yesterday. The white king of Sarawak, Brooke, boarded the British ship HMS Gnat and disembarked only after more than an hour. It is now believed that because Sarawak has important relations with British Malaya, he specifically boarded the ship to participate in the discussion. According to widespread rumors here today, the authorities view the defense of the Malayan coast as related to the consolidation of the defense of the Singapore naval base. The issue of strengthening Singapore's defense was resolved at the last meeting, but there has been no official announcement. Yesterday afternoon, naval officials moved the meeting location from HMS Gnat to the government offices on shore, and the meeting was still held in secret.

<h3 id="e80">The Current Situation of Anti-Japanese Resistance in Jilin's Jiandao (2) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence</p>
<p>In the previous correspondence, I briefly introduced the history of Jiandao, the establishment of the so-called anti-Japanese "People's Revolutionary Government," and the general anti-Japanese organizations in the area. Now, I will further describe the area of the organization and the situation of the Japanese and puppet troops as follows: The six locations of Wangyugou, Shirengou, Hualianli, Changrengou, Dongzigou within Yanji County of Jilin, and Sisuping within Wangqing County are all so-called People's Revolutionary Government areas. Although these locations are close to major cities, they are all mountainous areas that are not easy to attack, and because the locations are interconnected, if the Japanese and puppet troops attack one place, they can escape to another. The base is in Wangyugou, and the headquarters of the Eastern Manchurian Special Committee is located here. Last November, the Japanese army sent troops to attack. At that time, some areas were indeed completely swept away. However, in December, when the Japanese army retreated, they rose up again and continued to carry out their work in the area. When the Japanese army goes there, it must mobilize a large number of troops; otherwise, not only will military equipment be confiscated, but the soldiers will also not be able to return.</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops have launched attacks many times, but they are not afraid of this, and they have made considerable preparations in advance, so the Japanese and puppet troops cannot easily succeed. In fact, the area only occupies a few dozen li near Juzi Street. However, within this area, people who oppose the government are not allowed to take a step without authorization. Strict guard networks are set up everywhere. Last August, a Japanese couple working along the South Manchuria Railway line mistakenly entered the area and were detained for more than a month before being released. After returning, they talked about the situation in the area, saying, "At first, we thought we would be killed, but after the party cadres found out that we were indeed lost people and not spies, they treated us very well. Finally, they escorted us to the border and solemnly said, 'This is our national border. We do not allow anyone to arbitrarily enter our territory, nor do we arbitrarily enter other people's territory. Please convey this message to others after you return.'"</p>
<p>Looking at the above, one can understand the seriousness of their defense of the area. On the border of the area, sentries are stationed day and night. If they see Japanese and puppet troops coming to attack, the first line of sentries will throw homemade explosive bombs to notify the sentries on the mountain. The message is passed from one to two, and from two to three, and then reported to the headquarters. In an instant, everyone escapes into the dense forest in the mountains. If the Japanese and puppet troops attack at night, they light a fire on the top of the mountain, and the signal is transmitted from this mountain to that mountain by means of beacon fire, notifying the headquarters, and they flee to the predetermined location together. Armed personnel resist the Japanese and puppet troops, trying to concentrate the Japanese and puppet troops in one place so that other personnel can take the opportunity to escape, while they retreat along a predetermined path, and fight as they retreat, eventually causing outsiders to retreat without understanding the path. Armed party members only take the guns of the fallen party members, and abandon their bodies, because they value weapons more than human corpses. When escaping, they all tightly bind their leggings, carry daily necessities, and food that can last for six or seven days, making a home wherever they go. When they see the Japanese army coming, they escape to another place. They are familiar with the mountain roads, as if they are walking in their own houses, and they will not get lost no matter how winding the path is. What is left in the villages are only the elderly, weak, women, and children. The Japanese Consulate General Police Yilangou Sub-station is stationed more than ten li outside Wangyugou, the central area of the government. From May to November last year, it fought with the nearby army as many as 87 times. The first line of sentries of the government is on the top of the mountain six li away from the Yilangou Japanese police station.</p>
<p>As for bullets and gunpowder, it is said that they are self-made. The manufacturer is a Korean old man in his sixties who used to be a technician in an arms manufacturing factory. His name is Guo Xiangxue. He privately manufactured ammunition in the deep mountains of Hamgyongnam-do in Korea and participated in the independence movement. After that, he took refuge in Liuhe County, Liaoning, and continued to manufacture gunpowder guns and bullets, and participated in various independence movements. Last August, he was summoned by the government and is now manufacturing bullets and explosives with two assistants in an underground room in Wangyugou for the government.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army attacked, they burned down houses and huts to cut off their return route. Wangyugou and other places were almost completely swept away, but they soon returned in formation and started working. They live a life of escaping in the deep mountains, sleeping in the grass in summer and digging holes to live together in winter, gathering five or six people in one hole, some of which even contain printing presses, so they do not forget their work even in a life of escape.</p>
<p>Although they try to preserve their strength, the population has inevitably decreased due to the repeated attacks and deaths by the Japanese and puppet troops. In order to expand their influence and work, they are trying their best to lure Korean farmers and railway workers to join the anti-Japanese work, and distribute land to them for cultivation, and when necessary, they also make them join in resisting foreign enemies or transporting items.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to further consolidate the foundation of the government area, they have changed from the previous direct action, and now carry out organization, propaganda, and riot work simultaneously. All people within the territory need to be monitored by armed party members, restricting their freedom and strictly preventing them from defecting to the Japanese and puppet troops. In order to prepare for the winter, party cadres strictly prohibit the export of autumn harvested grains outside the area. Anyone who violates this order is not only considered a counter-revolutionary, but is also punished on the spot.</p>
<p>Between February and November of last year, the Japanese and puppet authorities organized the "Jiandao Communist Bandit Surrender Review Committee." It is said that more than a thousand people went to surrender. These are mostly Korean farmers and natives who have lived in the deep mountains of Jiandao for a long time, who do not know who owns the land they live on, and do not know what the Soviet Union or Japan is. They only know how to cultivate when the sun rises and rest when the sun sets, and they cultivate all day long for warmth and a full stomach.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese and puppet authorities have been trying their best to attack, using both military force and political means. Therefore, the Jiandao Map Security Maintenance Association and the Manchukuo Concord Association Jiandao Local Affairs Bureau have been established. While coordinating with military police and other agencies, military force and politics are carried out simultaneously, so the fate of this organization cannot be predicted. (The End)</p>

<p>Liu Jianxu Stationed in Lianhua to Vigorously Suppress the Xiao Bandits</p>
<p>Liu Yinggu Stationed in Wanzai to Supervise the Suppression of the Kong Bandits</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After He Jian took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Army of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Hunan-Hubei West Route, he commanded fourteen divisions and two independent brigades to suppress the Red bandits in the Jiangxi West, Jiangxi North, Hubei South, and Hunan East areas. For several months, the bandit areas have been shrinking day by day. The bandits in the Western Route only have two major groups: Xiao Ke and Kong Hechong, with a total of no more than 30,000 guns. They have been severely suppressed by the Western Route and have suffered heavy losses in dozens or hundreds of battles, large and small. Important bandit nests have also been captured by the National Army. Here is a detailed description of the recent situation of the Xiao and Kong bandits: The Situation of the Xiao Bandits</p>
<p>The Xiao bandits are the strongest in Jiangxi West, with about 20,000 guns and twice as many people. They have been entrenched in the Lianhua, Ninggang, and Yongxin areas for the longest time, and from time to time they invade the counties of Chaling, Youxian, and Liling in Hunan East, and Pingxiang in Jiangxi. The task of the Western Route Army to suppress bandits is to target the Xiao bandits as its biggest goal. After the establishment of the Western Route Army in June last year, He Jian sent Liu Jianxu, the commander of the 28th Army and the commander of the First Column of the Western Route Army, to lead the 15th Division of Wang Dongyuan, the 16th Division of Peng Weiren, and the 63rd Division of Chen Guangzhong to advance from Chaling to Lianhua, Ninggang, and Yongxin to suppress the bandits. In August, the Ninggang was recovered by Wang Dongyuan's division. In October, Lianhua was recovered by Chen Guangzhong's division. However, both Ninggang and Lianhua counties have been captured by bandits for six years and have been deeply infiltrated by bandits. Although the county towns have been recovered, the bandits still entrenched in the surrounding villages. After two or three months of suppression, the villages and towns were completely recovered until December. Liu Jianxu then moved from Chaling to Lianhua and continued to advance towards the Yongxin bandit nest. It has been found that Yongxin is the base of the Xiao bandits, with a large area and the danger of Qixi Ridge and Meihua Mountain. The Xiao bandits occupy it as a nest. Liu Jianxu used the method of advancing step by step with the three divisions to encircle Yongxin. Because the National Army was pressing closer and closer, Yongxin was afraid that it would be difficult to hold out for long, so it implemented a plan to abandon the old nest and develop a new Soviet area, moving its strength to attack Anfufu and leaving only the guard division, the Red Army School, and an independent regiment of about 2,000 to 3,000 people to defend Meihua Mountain. Peng Weiren's 16th Division launched an attack on January 11 this year, braving the snow. After fierce fighting until dawn on the 13th, Liu Jiren's brigade occupied the General Mountain, Wufu Temple, Meihua Mountain, and other important positions. The bandits retreated to Yongxin. Peng's division is now chasing to the outside of Yongquan City and encircling it, and it can be recovered soon. At the same time, the main force of the Xiao bandits surrounded Anfu on the 10th. Only one regiment of troops was stationed in the city, closing the city and defending it to wait for reinforcements. Liu Jianxu reported and ordered part of Peng's division and Wang Dongyuan's division to rush to aid. It is expected that they can arrive on the 23rd or 24th. Anfu has been besieged for half a month. After the reinforcements arrive, there will be a fierce battle in Anfu. According to the captured bandits, the Xiao bandits had three intentions for attacking Anfu: 1. They can cross east to join the pseudo-135th Army Group. 2. They can establish contact with the Kong bandits. 3. They can attack Ji'an and obtain a central location in the Gan River. However, judging from the situation, the old nest of the Xiao bandits, Yongxin, will inevitably be lost and can be captured sooner or later, and the new Soviet area of ​​Anfu County that they are trying to obtain is now being aided by reinforcements, and it will be difficult to obtain it. Even if it can be captured, Anfu is an area of ​​four battles and has no important risks to defend. There is also a highway to Ji'an that can be passed, and it is a place where the Northwest and West Route armies can attack from both sides, so it is difficult to occupy it for a long time. Therefore, the current situation of the Xiao bandits will inevitably lead to a wandering existence.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Situation of the Kong Bandits <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Kong Hechong only has more than 10,000 guns, and his strength is not as strong as that of the Xiao bandits. He has been disrupting the Pingjiang and Liuyang areas of Hunan East, the Xiushui, Wanzai, Tonggu, and Pingxiang areas of Jiangxi Northwest, and the Chongyang and Tongcheng areas of Hubei South for six or seven years. The intensity of the damage is the worst of all the bandits. After the establishment of the West Route Army, He Jian ordered Chen Jicheng, commander of the Third Column, to send troops to block the Chongtong area of ​​Hubei South, and Li Jue's 19th Route Army to be stationed in the Pingliu area of ​​Hunan East to block the bandits. He also sent the 18th Division of Zhu Yaohua, the 50th Division of Yue Sen, and the 62nd Division of Tao Guang, which belong to the Second Column, to take charge of suppressing the bandits. After half a year of suppression, they successively recovered the county towns of Xiushui, Tonggu, and Wanzai and gradually searched into the bandit area. The Kong bandits originally relied on the danger of two bandit nests, one is Gao Cun and the other is Xiao Yuan, both of which are under the jurisdiction of Wanzai County. The mountains are steep and not easy to enter. The Western Route Army spent a lot of effort and finally recovered Gao Cun by Tao Guangren's brigade last month. At present, the Kong bandits have fled into the Xiao Yuan bandit nest, relying on the danger and stubbornly resisting. The bandit area has been shrinking day by day. He Jian has sent Liu Yinggu, commander of the Second Column, to be stationed in Wanzai from Pingxiang a few days ago to supervise the advance of his troops towards the Xiao Yuan bandit nest, and ordered him to destroy the bandits in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Judging from the above situation, the bandit suppression situation of the West Route Army is gradually improving. He Jian reported in the memorial week that as long as the bandits in the North Route do not flee west, the mission of the West Route Army (that is, suppressing the Xiao and Kong bandits) can be completed in at most four months. However, the banditry in various places is too deep, and there is nothing left. The pacification and rehabilitation will still take a lot of effort. (January 24)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Major Theft at the Shan Zhai Library <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Seventy-One Stolen Antiquities</p>
<p>The Case Solved, Returning Everything Intact</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Library holds an extremely rich collection of ancient artifacts, bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. On the twenty-first of this month, a shocking major theft occurred. The bandits entered by scaling the wall from the north along the telegraph poles and stole a total of seventy-one items from the ancient art exhibition room, including Song, Ming, and Qing dynasty porcelain, Han dynasty jade and bronze ware, and ancient book boxes. The library director, Wang Xiantang, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, reported it to the Department of Education and the Public Security Bureau and notified all parties to maintain strict secrecy in order to apprehend the bandits and recover the stolen items. In the days that followed, the Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives in disguise to investigate. On the evening of the twenty-fourth, the thief, Si Zhengming, returned to the reed ponds on the shore of Daming Lake in front of the library to retrieve five more porcelain plates and other items that he had hidden, but he was spotted and arrested by Zhao Shiqi, a patrol officer from the Second Police Station of the Third Branch of the city's Public Security Bureau. Today (the 25th), his home was searched, and his wife, Si Zhao, was arrested. Under strict interrogation, they confessed that the stolen artifacts were hidden in the tile ridges on the roof. The detective team recovered them, fortunately, all intact and without any losses. They have been reclaimed by the library. The Public Security Bureau believes that a theft of this magnitude could not have been carried out by one or two people alone, and investigations and interrogations are still ongoing. The details of the theft and its resolution are quite convoluted. The details of what happened are recorded below:</p>
<p>Discovery of the Theft: The theft of ancient artifacts from the Shandong Provincial Library occurred on the night of the twenty-first. That day was a Sunday, and the library was closed on Mondays, as usual. Most of the library staff went home in the evening or went out to play. Even those who returned to the library slept soundly. The thieves took advantage of this opportunity to carry out their scheme, scaling the wall and entering the premises at night, stealing as many as seventy-one ancient artifacts from the ancient art exhibition room. On Monday (the 22nd) morning, the library director, Wang Xiantang, got up early to inspect the premises and was surprised to see the door of the art exhibition room in the back courtyard wide open. Upon entering to investigate, he found the door damaged, the lock broken, and half of the ancient treasures missing. He knew it had been robbed. He inspected the courtyard and found a ladder leaning against the wall near the rockery in the northeast corner of the front courtyard, tied to a tree with a rope. On the ground, there was a Han dynasty ding (cauldron) containing several other small artifacts. This was evidently the thieves' entry and exit point. The Han ding was something they had been unable to carry away, and the ladder was the one used by the library to clean chimneys, which the thieves had moved after entering the premises.</p>
<p>Seventy-One Items: A detailed examination revealed that a total of seventy-one items were missing: (1) Porcelain: One sky-blue bottle (Qianlong), one belt-pierced bottle (Qianlong), one Longquan plate (Ming), one wucai (five-color) plate (Wanli), three celadon flower plates (Chenghua), two blue-and-white large fruit plates (Yongzheng), one Song white porcelain incense burner, one Song dragon incense burner, one qinghua (blue-and-white) pouring vessel (Xuande), one "dragon ball watching the sea" zun (Yongzheng), one Qianlong Jian ware wine ewer, one qingbai (bluish-white) plum blossom vase (Yongzheng), one wucai moon flask, one small Song zhi bottle with copper rim, three Ge ware plum blossom vases, eight large Jiajing yellow-glazed plates, one Ming Longquan plate, one Qianlong sky-blue plate, two large Chenghua painted flower bowls, one large Jiajing blue-and-white flower bowl, one Yongzheng wucai bowl, six red dragon sea bowls, two Qianlong rouge-red bowls, one Ming Longquan large fruit plate, one Tang porcelain jar; (2) Jade ware: one Han openwork jade cup, one Han jade bottle, one Han jade elephant-ear zun, one square zun, one flat flower vase, one jadeite garment pin, one Han jade chime, one Song jade chime; (3) Bronze ware: one Han hu (wine vessel) with yi (arrowhead) spout, one Zhou ding, one washing basin, four bronze mirrors, one Han yi (ewer), one Han dou (stemmed dish), one Han stele jade; (4) Books: two scrolls of Tang dynasty sutras, one volume of "Imperial Favorite: The Secret Method of Subduing Evil and Promoting Loyalty and Filial Piety," one volume of "Collected Works of Mr. Li of Wufeng," one volume of "Old Clouds Gathered at Gao Nanbu," one volume of "Pointing to the Moon with the South China Classic," one volume of "Seventeen Ancient Rhyme Manuals from the Yanshoujing Studio," one volume of "Han Shu Geography Index," and one volume of "Enping Travelogue." All seventy-one items are extremely precious and of immense value.</p>
<p>Detectives Sent Out: After discovering the theft, the library immediately reported the details of the robbery and the list of stolen artifacts to the Second Police Station of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau and requested the arrest of the perpetrators and the recovery of the stolen goods. It also reported the matter to the Department of Education. Before long, the Director of the Department of Education, He Siyuan, and the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Kai Ru, recognizing the gravity of the situation, arrived at the library one after another to inspect the scene. It was agreed that strict secrecy should be maintained in order to facilitate the investigation. Detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate the crime in disguise. The captain of the Special Detective Team, Liu Yaoting, also sent plainclothes officers to assist in the effort. However, the incident was strange, and there were initially no clues to be found. Therefore, plainclothes officers were deployed everywhere, both inside and outside Daming Lake near the library, as well as at the fire station and other places, to conduct thorough investigations. After two days, there were still no results.</p>
<p>The Thief Arrested: Yesterday (the 24th) at around 6 p.m., Zhao Shiqi, a patrol officer from the Second Police Station of the Third Branch of the city, disguised as a public official, was patrolling the mooring area on the small north-south road in Daming Lake, inside Huachiao. The dusk was deepening, and the cold wind chilled to the bone. There were no tourists to be seen. The patrol officer was lost in thought, still unable to find a clue, when he suddenly saw a middle-aged man walking along the lake embankment leading to the Lixia Pavilion, coming from north to south. He was carrying a quilt cover and a hook that looked like a hand tool, and his behavior was quite suspicious. The patrol officer took notice of him. When the man walked out of the gate leading into the lake, the patrol officer followed him. When he reached the western end of the Quehua Bridge, he hurriedly got into a rickshaw without bargaining and wanted to head west. The patrol officer immediately caught up and asked what was in the quilt cover. The man replied that it contained a few old books. When asked what else was inside, he appeared alarmed and stammered that there were also a few pieces of porcelain. The patrol officer became even more suspicious. At that moment, a guard from the Twenty-Seventh Watch Post of the Second Police Station of the Third Branch ordered an inspection. The man knew that he had been exposed, so he abandoned the quilt cover and fled in the direction from which he had come. The patrol officer joined the guard in a chase, pursuing him west along the newly constructed lakefront to the north of the library gate, where he was finally apprehended. The suspect resisted arrest with all his might, and the two sides fought hand-to-hand. However, he was outnumbered and eventually subdued. They returned to the Quehua Bridge and recovered the quilt cover he had abandoned, which contained five ancient plates that had been stolen from the library. They were immediately taken together to the Third Branch of the city's Public Security Bureau on Xiyan Gong Street, west of the Provincial Party Headquarters. Patrol Officer Zhao interrogated him first. He identified himself as Si Zhengming, 34 years old, from Pingyin County, Shandong Province, residing at No. 41 Houjie Street, Tongyuan Bureau. He had formerly been a member of the Communist Party and had served as an employee in the Communist Eradication Team after surrendering himself to the Provincial Party Headquarters. He had since been dismissed. He claimed that the five porcelain plates were what he had stolen and hidden in the lake, and he had only come to retrieve them tonight. He denied stealing anything else or having any accomplices.</p>
<p>Confessing the Truth: After the Third Branch solved the case, they detained the suspect at the bureau because it was already late. This morning (the 25th), they transferred him to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, where he was interrogated once by the Judicial Section. The suspect's confession remained the same as the one he gave at the bureau. The General Bureau then ordered Tian Sirong, the director of the Third Branch, to bring officers, along with Deputy Team Leader Feng of the Special Affairs Team, to the suspect's home at No. 41 Houjie Street, Tongyuan Bureau, to conduct a search. Si Zhengming's wife, Si Zhao, strongly denied any knowledge of the stolen antiques. Deputy Team Leader Feng and others conducted a thorough search of the house but found nothing. Then, they saw Si Zhao hurriedly tearing a piece of paper into small pieces and stuffing them into her mouth. Feng and others immediately suspected something was amiss and demanded to know what she had swallowed. Si Zhao claimed it was a prescription. Seeing her evasive language, Feng and others seized the torn pieces of paper and pieced them together. It turned out to be a list of antiques she had made herself, with serial numbers. There was no doubt that all the other antiques had been stolen by them. However, after searching for a long time, they still found nothing. They took Si Zhao to the bureau for strict interrogation. Deputy Team Leader Feng then coaxed her, pretending to reassure her that she would be innocent if she told the truth, otherwise, her life would be in danger. Si Zhao believed him and confessed that all the stolen antiques were hidden in her home. She was willing to lead them home to unearth the loot. Deputy Team Leader Feng, Tian Sirong, Director of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and others accompanied Si Zhao to Si Zhengming's home to recover the stolen goods at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Full Recovery of Stolen Goods: Deputy Team Leader Feng and his party arrived at Si Zhengming's home a second time, relying entirely on Si Zhao to direct their actions. In the west end of the north room, there was a women's toilet with a door next to it. A window was opened above the door. Deputy Team Leader Feng and others had found this suspicious during their initial inspection, but after searching, they found nothing. Now, Si Zhao led them to this location and told them that all the stolen antiques were hidden in the tiles on the roof outside the window. Deputy Team Leader Feng and others still could not find a way in. Under Si Zhao's guidance, they removed the tiles connecting to the neighbor's roof ridges. Suddenly, the entire batch of antiques appeared before them. Each item was wrapped in coarse paper. After counting and verifying, nothing was missing. Without someone to guide them, it would have been difficult to find this place. The precise arrangement was evident. The stolen goods were recovered. Deputy Team Leader Feng and others immediately carried them back to the General Bureau to report. They recounted them, and nothing was missing. Then, Director Wang Xiantang sent someone from the library to the bureau to check the items against the list and transport them back to the library. It was already 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Details of the Theft: The Public Security Bureau, with the evidence in hand and the case largely clarified, had Si Zhengming brought forward by the Judicial Section for strict interrogation. With the facts before him, Si Zhengming had no room for denial and confessed the entire course of his theft. He said that around 1 a.m. on the twenty-second, he climbed over the wall from the north side of the library gate along the telegraph poles. Inside the wall, there was a rockery made of flowers and stones, which was very close to the top of the wall. He climbed down from the rockery. Because the place was very close to the staff room, there was still light in the room, and he could hear the sound of someone taking medicine, so he did not dare to act at the time. He squatted in a secluded place to wait. It wasn't until 4 a.m. that he sneaked to the art exhibition room. The room had two doors, both of which were locked. He used the pliers he brought with him to break the locks, then entered the room, which was where the antiques were displayed. The antiques were displayed on shelves inside, and the shelves were also locked. He broke those locks as well, selected the valuable items, and wrapped them in coarse paper one by one. After packing them into one quilt cover and two willow baskets, he transported them to the wall where he had originally entered. He found a wooden ladder to help deliver the stolen items one by one over the wall with a rope. By this time, it was already after 6 a.m. Residents in the back street were already getting up early to work. Fearing that they would notice, he did not have time to transport one ding (cauldron) and left it inside the wall. The remaining items that had already been transported out were loaded onto a small boat and transported along the lake to the back of the Li Gong Temple, where they were then loaded onto a cart and transported home. However, five large plates were too heavy to transport at the time, so they were wrapped in a bundle and sunk in the lake. He only went to retrieve them last night (the 25th), and he was exposed because of these five plates, he said. (Twenty-fifth day)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Maritime Transportation Between Guangdong and Fujian Resumes <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Situation in Fujian After the 19th Route Army Initially Withdraws</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: When the central government used force against Fujian, the Shantou Customs, under the order of the Inspector General of Customs, temporarily detained electric-powered and sailing ships traveling to and from Fujian, implementing a maritime blockade policy against the Fujian side. For a time, freight transport was suspended, and transportation between Fujian and Guangdong relied entirely on land routes. One route went from Shantou to Chenghai Zhanglin, then turned to Huanggang and entered Zhao'an. The other route went from Dabu to Yongding. In terms of distance, Shantou to Zhao'an could be reached in six hours, but in Huanggang, one had to travel eighteen li on an unfinished highway, and then reach Fenshui Pass to take a car to Zhao'an City. If one was familiar with the route and the language, this route could be a shortcut to Fujian. However, the road from Zhao'an to Yunxiao had to pass through Erdu. This highway had its bridges demolished when Zhang Zhen withdrew his troops the year before, and there were no cars running to this day. Moreover, there were many bandits along the way. If one could reach Yunxiao, there would be cars going directly to Zhangzhou, which would take about two hours. The 19th Route Army did not station troops in Yunxiao, Pinghe, or Zhao'an. The public order in these areas was poor. In the past, passengers and goods traveling to and from the area had to be escorted by the local militia and reserve forces. Now, it is regarded as a dangerous route.</p>
<p>After the 19th Route Army retreated to southern Fujian, their troops were distributed in the area from Qingyang below Jinjiang South Gate to Anhai Shitou, with about one regiment stationed there. One regiment was also stationed in Shishi Weitou, Tong'an, and Jimei. One regiment was stationed along the Zhangsong line of Shimei Haicang Songyu. One regiment was stationed along the Zhangfu line of Haicheng Shima Fugong. The main force was stationed near Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. The 19th Route Army had strict security measures along the Songzhang and Songzhangfu lines, with fortifications built at strategic locations. Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu were also in Zhangzhou, Jiang Guangnai was in Tong'an, and Cai Tingkai was in Quanzhou. Jiang, Cai, and Chen were prepared to each take charge of one of three fronts of combat. On the central government side, Zhang Zhi led the central army to attack Putian and Xianyou, Zhao Qintao attacked Datian and Dehua, and Jiang Dingwen transported troops by sea to Xiamen to take charge of attacking Zhangzhou. How the battles on these three fronts are unfolding, we have not yet received details here. Maritime transportation has resumed in recent days. The Haiyang, Haining, Haicheng, and Haishun ships, which passed through Fuzhou and Xiamen to Shantou and Hong Kong, sailed on the fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first, respectively. These four ships were filled with people from military and political circles. The first- and second-class cabins were completely full. There were also more than a thousand passengers on the large ships. All the passengers returning to Shantou by ship changed to boats and cars to enter the inland areas of Chao'an or Jieyang immediately after disembarking. They did not stop in Shantou for trade, as if it had been arranged in advance. When asked about the recent situation in Fujian, everyone was tight-lipped. It was said that when they passed through Xiamen on the twentieth, the Xiamen authorities did not allow passengers to disembark. Those who transferred to Gulangyu to inquire about the news learned that Fugong and Songyu had been occupied by the central army. The Wanxiang and Tunan and other China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships carrying troops had already unloaded military supplies. Two central naval vessels were protecting the ships.

<p>At No. 41 Xiaozhu Lane outside Changmen Gate, someone was secretly setting up a red pill manufacturing den. After someone informed the Public Security Bureau's Third Branch, yesterday (the 27th) at 10 a.m., the bureau dispatched patrol officers and several policemen to conduct a search. After six hours of secret investigation, they finally found a red pill manufacturing machine, ten bags of red pills, several bags of raw materials such as sugar powder, ten liang of opium, dozens of liang of ingredients, and several bundles of Shuangshi (Double Lion) brand and Shiqiu (Lion Ball) brand red pill wrapping paper in the back garden. Several dozen wholesale ledgers and several invoice stamps were also found. The red pill manufacturing worker, Li Huanyun, and an employee were taken to the bureau together. According to Li's confession, the boss who manufactured the red pills had already fled. The manufactured red pills were sold to this city and various villages, as well as to neighboring Wuxi County and other places, which also came to buy wholesale, and so on.</p>

<p>Chen Tingkun, 55, the owner of Chen Tingji Woodworks in Li Lane outside Ximen Gate, had a wife named Huang, 57, and had one son and three daughters. The son, named Peikun, was already married. The eldest daughter, Cuixia, 22, was married to the Hu family in Yanqiao. The second daughter, Cuiyun, 18, was betrothed to the Jiang family but had not yet moved in. The youngest daughter, Amo, 13, was studying at school. However, Cuiyun was romantic and good at socializing. On the night before (the 26th) at about 9 p.m., Chen Huang, along with her youngest daughter, Amo, and her nephew, Huang Yunlun (8 years old), were sleeping in the front room. At about 11 p.m., a thug suddenly entered from the window, wielding an axe and aiming it at Chen Huang's head, chopping down three times with full force. Blood splattered everywhere, and brain matter burst out. After Chen Huang felt the pain, her legs thrashed wildly. Amo, shocked, looked up and saw her mother on her last breaths. She shouted loudly for help. By this time, the thug had already fled. The family members, hearing the sound, woke up in shock. They immediately carried the injured woman to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, because her skull had been shattered and she had lost too much blood, it was too late to save her, and she died immediately. The next day, Fan Xin, the director of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, personally went to investigate and recovered an axe left behind by the killer. He took the two daughters, Cuiyun and Amo, to the bureau for questioning. At the same time, Chen Zizhao, the chief of Nian Er Tu, reported to the County Court, requesting an autopsy as proof for handling the case.</p>

<p>Police officer Shi Xiaoming (from Guangxi) of the Third Station of the Public Security Bureau's Third Branch, while on duty at the Jingqiao checkpoint in his jurisdiction on the evening before (the 26th) at about 8 p.m., encountered a patrol from the Fifth Squad of the local militia passing by. The police officer was slightly slow in saluting, and the militia suspected that he was intentionally showing disrespect, so they questioned him. A conflict arose between them, and the militia injured the police officer. Officer Shi, feeling insulted, immediately ran back to the bureau and reported the situation to Branch Director Mao. At the same time, all the police officers in the bureau, upon hearing the news, were indignant and unanimously left their posts. Subsequently, Patrol Leaders Long Baoda and Xu Zhian led several police officers to the headquarters of the Fifth Squad of the militia to invite Squad Leader Guo to the bureau for talks. Unexpectedly, the militia misunderstood, suspecting that the police officers had come to retaliate, so the order was disrupted for a time. During the turmoil, the equipment in the squad headquarters was slightly damaged. Later, Xu Yi, the winter defense director of the county government, as well as Li Wengong, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Inspector General Wei Yu mediated. However, the two sides reported their respective grievances, making it difficult to resolve the situation. It was subsequently decided to report the situation to the county government for the county magistrate to provide instructions before determining a resolution. The police officers of the Third Branch have already returned to their posts as a whole and are awaiting orders from their superiors.</p>

<p>Jin, the wife of Ren Dabao, a villager in Chen Douban Lane, Liu Tan Bridge South (Tianxia Market) in the Sixth District of the county, returned from chanting Buddhist scriptures at the Dongping Wang Temple nearby on the previous evening and went to bed. Unexpectedly, she accidentally knocked over the foot warmer, causing it to burn the bedding. Jin was unable to escape and was buried in the fire. It took about half an hour to extinguish the fire, but five houses had already been completely destroyed. Also, at Wufeng Candle Shop in Bu Lane outside the North Gate, a fire suddenly broke out at 3 a.m. yesterday (the 27th). The entire shop, with its two bays and three buildings, was completely destroyed, with losses estimated at more than 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>In mid-September of last year, the Dacheng Flower Shop in Nanyang Village, Qidong County, was robbed by bandits of 6,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars, and an old clerk was shot and killed. Wang Yunshan, the captain of the county's detective team, arrested Wu Changqing, one of the bandits in this case, in Shanghai and confiscated 100 yuan in banknotes. He was immediately brought back for questioning. According to his confession, the crime was committed together with Shi Zhaolin, Zhou Xiaodi, and others who were still at large. Yesterday, Captain Wang arrested Shi Cai'gen, the younger brother of Shi Zhaolin, in Shanghai. He immediately submitted him to the county government, awaiting the county's dispatch of police to escort him back for investigation.</p>

<p>Yan Chuntang, a drug dealer, obtained more than 1,200 jin of Jinji (Golden Rooster) brand red pills in Shanghai the day before and shipped them to Wuxi for sale by boat. When passing through the Datong Bridge in Pengjian Town in this county, Jiang Zhen, a patrol officer from the local Public Security Sub-Station, learned of this and immediately sent police to detain the boat. Later, Yan paid a bribe of 1,300 yuan to redeem the boat and the red pills, which continued on to Wuxi for sale. This matter was discovered by Hua Shijun, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, who was greatly angered and sent Wen Zongxin, the director of the relevant sub-bureau, to conduct a secret investigation yesterday morning.</p>

<p>The rickshaw pullers in Zhenjiang, due to demands for rent reductions and requests to eliminate the joint operation of buses, started a work slowdown. Yesterday, it suddenly affected everyone, and the situation became serious. Because they could not eat on days they did not pull, they all hoped that the authorities would quickly respond to their demands. Unexpectedly, the authorities ignored them. Therefore, the rickshaw pullers' families went out to prevent the joint operation buses of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Company from passing through. Xiang Zhizhuang, the director of the Security Office, in an attempt to quickly resolve the situation, summoned rickshaw puller representatives Fang Yuanhong and others for talks, promising to respond the same day. Lu Xiaobo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, also convened all the rickshaw shop owners at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss the issue of rent reduction. More than ten people, including Cao Liqing and Yang Dianba, attended. After talking for over an hour, no satisfactory solution was reached. Because of cost considerations, the rickshaw shop owners insisted that they could not reduce the rent. The rickshaw pullers had no choice but to gather again at the station, forcibly preventing the joint operation buses from passing through. The military police tried their best to persuade them, and no incident occurred. However, the Chamber of Commerce, fearing that the situation would escalate, has sent a letter to Zeng Zhihong, the stationmaster of Zhenjiang Station, to forward it to the Railway Bureau, requesting that the joint operation be postponed to avoid affecting the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers during this cold winter. We do not know how the Railway Bureau will handle it. In recent days, no rickshaws have been seen on the streets, causing great inconvenience for passengers getting on and off at the station and the wharves along the river. Pedestrians are lamenting that they cannot travel.</p>

<p>In mid-September of last year, the Dacheng Flower Shop in Nanyang Village, Qidong County, was robbed by bandits of 6,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars, and an old clerk was shot and killed. Wang Yunshan, the captain of this county's detective team, arrested Wu Changqing, one of the bandits in this case, in Shanghai and confiscated 100 yuan in banknotes. He was immediately brought back for questioning. According to his confession, the crime was committed together with Shi Zhaolin, Zhou Xiaodi, and others who were still at large. Yesterday, Captain Wang arrested Shi Cai'gen, the younger brother of Shi Zhaolin, in Shanghai. He immediately submitted him to the county government, awaiting the county's dispatch of police to escort him back for investigation.</p>

Later, Yan paid a bribe of 1,300 yuan to redeem the boat and the red pills, which continued on to Wuxi for sale. This matter was discovered by Hua Shijun, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, who was greatly angered and sent Wen Zongxin, the director of the relevant sub-bureau, to conduct a secret investigation yesterday morning.</p>

<p>The rickshaw pullers in Zhenjiang, due to wanting a reduction in rent and requesting the elimination of jointly operated buses, started a work slowdown. Yesterday, it suddenly affected everyone, and the situation became serious. Because they cannot earn one day, they eat one day less, everyone is hoping that the authorities will quickly respond to their demands. Unexpectedly, all sides ignored this matter. Therefore, the rickshaw pullers' families went out to prevent the joint operation buses of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Company from passing through. Xiang Zhizhuang, the director of the Security Office, in an attempt to quickly resolve the situation, summoned rickshaw puller representatives Fang Yuanhong and others for talks, promising to respond the same day.

We do not know how the Railway Bureau will handle it. In recent days, no rickshaws have been seen on the streets, causing great inconvenience for passengers getting on and off at the station and the wharves along the river.

<p>Letter to the People:</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters' Letter to the People Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese Resistance (Excerpt Above): Today, Two Years Ago, Is the Anniversary of the Japanese Imperialists' Massacre of the Shanghai People with Airplanes and Cannons. It is Also the Most Painful Anniversary for Our Entire Republic of China After "September 18th," Suffering from the Invasion and Oppression of Japanese Warlords. More Than Two Years Have Passed Since the Incident. The Ashes of the Songhu Disaster Remain as Before, and This Great National Shame and Deep Hatred Has Not Only Not Been Erased, but Has Become Increasingly Serious. How Heartbreaking This Is. What Makes Us Especially Sad Today Is That the 19th Route Army, Which Once Boasted of "Guns Pointing Outward and Never Inward" and Contributed to the War, Now Does Not Cherish Itself and Colludes with Japan in Fujian to Suppress Communists, Committing Acts of Destroying the Party and Betraying the Country. The Former Pain Lies in Foreign Aggression, and the Latter Pain Lies in Internal Trouble. Foreign Aggression Without Internal Trouble Can Sometimes Be Erased, but the Occurrence of Internal Trouble Directly Exacerbates Foreign Aggression. Therefore, If We Do Not Want to Save the Country, Then So Be It. If We Want to Save This Perilous Country, We Must First Address What Is Urgent and Then Whip What Is Not Urgent. In Other Words, We Must First Pacify the Interior and Then Repel Foreign Aggressors (Middle Excerpt). In the Past, the 19th Route Army Only Took the Opportunity to Steal the Name of Patriotism as a Cover for Deceiving the People. As of Today, When the Fujian Incident Occurred, Its True Colors Were Finally Exposed. Therefore, All Truly Patriotic Soldiers Must Always Be Under the Central Government's Control to Maintain the Party and the Country in Order to Survive and Obtain National Protection. Otherwise, Seeking Temporary False Fame and Trying to Achieve One's Ambitions Will Ultimately Fail. This Is Why the 19th Route Army, Which Incited Chaos in Fujian Today, Collapsed in an Instant. Furthermore, In the Battle of Songhu, Our Army's Combat Power Was Not Up to Par. However, the Enemy Ultimately Used Airplanes to Bombard Us, Causing Us to Be Unable to Withstand It and Retreat. We Deeply Learned from the Lessons of the Past. Therefore, During the First Anniversary Commemoration Last Year, We Held National Air Defense Propaganda. Over the Past Year, It Has Been Very Effective. Now, the Lost Territory in the Northeast Has Not Been Recovered, and the International Situation is Becoming Increasingly Urgent. The Difficulties of Tomorrow Are Just Beginning. Therefore, When We Commemorate "January 28th," We Should Continue to Expand the Work of Air Defense and Strengthen the Air Force's Strength in Time to Prepare for Self-Defense, Which Is to Unite to Erase the National Shame in the Future (Bottom Excerpt).</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Slogans:</p>
<p>(1) January 28th is a Day for the Brutal Sun to Invade Songhu and the Chinese People to Resist. (2) January 28th is a Day to Demonstrate the Spirit of the Chinese Nation. (3) Promote the Spirit of the Songhu National Revolutionary Army's Rising Up to Resist the Enemy on January 28th. (4) Compatriots Across the Country Unite to Expand the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement. (5) Compatriots Across the Country Unite to Realize Air Defense. (6) Vow to Implement Economic Severance, Boycott Enemy Goods, and Promote National Products. (7) Down with Japanese Imperialism. (8) Erase the Humiliation of January 28th. (9) Recover the Lost Territory in the Northeast. (10) Long Live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Citywide Alert:</p>
<p>In Order to Prevent Reactionary Elements from Causing Trouble, the Municipal Party Headquarters Specially Sent a Letter to the Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to Announce Martial Law. It Was Reported That the Garrison Department, the Municipal Security Department, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau Had Ordered Their Subordinates Several Days Ago to Dispatch Soldiers and Police to Guard Posts and Increase Patrols. They Also Sent Detectives, Inspectors, and Male and Female Inspectors to Important Locations to Implement Security and Inspect Pedestrians. The Vicinity of Various Agencies Was Under Especially Strict Security. The Police Departments of the Two Concessions Also Added Detectives to the Vicinity of Various Agencies, Factories, and the Border Between the Chinese and Foreign Concessions to Prevent Trouble from Spreading.</p>
<p>Public Sacrifice in Jiangwan:</p>
<p>The Jiangwan Seventh District Party Headquarters of This City, Due to Being Far From Shanghai, Specially Presented to the Municipal Party Headquarters to Convene Representatives From All Sectors in Jiangwan, Yinxiang, Yinhang, and Other Places at 9:00 AM Today in the Department's Auditorium to Hold a Commemorative Assembly. After the Meeting, All Representatives Will Go to the "January 28th" Martyrs' Cemetery in Changgou Bay, Jiangwan Garden Road, to Offer Public Sacrifices to Show Commemoration.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues a Commemorative Declaration. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issued a Commemorative Declaration for January 28th:</p>
<p>As the Saying Goes, "One Suffers Once, One Learns a Lesson." This, Although a Vulgar Saying From the Lower Class, Actually Contains the Ultimate Truth of Protecting the Country and the Home. The Songhu Blood Battle Left Scars That Are Still Fresh. Every Compatriot With a Little Blood and Knowledge Should Regard This Painful and Tragic Piece of History as a Deeply Engraved Lesson. This Certainly Does Not Require Our Redundancy. However, Merely Not Forgetting the National Crisis and Encouraging Oneself and Others Has Limited Effect. One Must Be Determined to Immerse Oneself in Hard Work to Have a Day to Escape the Sea of ​​Suffering and Reach the Other Shore. This Association Now Has a Word to Offer to Compatriots in Shanghai. If Someone Asks How to Compensate for the Loss of 140,000 Citizens of Shanghai in the Songhu Battle, Everyone Will Hesitate and Be Unable to Answer. However, This Association Believes That the Way to Compensate Lies in the Citizens Themselves. If Everyone is Determined to Swear That From Now On, They Will Not Use Anything Other Than National Products for Food, Clothing, and All Consumption, Then With Shanghai's Large Population and High Standard of Living, They Can Reduce the Annual Loss of 100 Million, and the Entire Loss of the Songhu Battle Can Be Compensated for in the Next Fourteen Years. This is the Most Practical Method of Subduing Others Without Fighting and Seeking Solutions Within Oneself. It Is Also the Saying "One Suffers Once, One Learns a Lesson." Otherwise, If a Son of a Wealthy Family Conspires to Seize His Inheritance With His Neighbor, and the Unfilial Son Still Privately Conspires With Money, He Will End Up With Nothing to Stand On. Now is the Critical Moment of Success or Failure. Compatriots Can Choose for Themselves.</p>
<p>The National Product Factory Jointly Issues a Letter to Compatriots:</p>
<p>The National News Agency Reports: The Chinese National Product Manufacturers Association Today Issued a January 28th Letter to All Sisters: "Sisters, You Can't All Be Unpatriotic People, Can You? You Can't All Be People Without Blood, Can You? We Often Have an Ideal That Comforts Ourselves, 'Chinese People Are Patriotic, How Can They Not Be United? Perhaps There Are Even More Patriotic People Than Us.' However, Facts Always Fail to Prove That This Ideal is Absolutely True. Although Everyone's Circumstances Are Different, Everyone Has Their Own Patriotic Claims and National Salvation Actions, We Can't Find One or Two Effective and Obvious Facts. Take the 'National Product Movement' As an Example, We Are Convinced That National Products Can Fundamentally Save the Country, But How Much Effect Has It Had? Alas, It's a Pity to Say. Originally, The Enemy Who is Seizing Our Land, Infringing Upon Our Sovereignty, Raping Our People, and Cutting Off Our Livelihood Used Economic Policies to Invade and Exploit Us in Addition to Military Policies. His Merchants Are Mostly Military Spies, and His Soldiers Are Also Business Advisors. Their Military Policies Against Us Have Long Been Clearly Displayed Before Our Eyes, but Perhaps You Don't Fully Understand Their Economic Policies Actively Being Carried Out in Secret. Economic Policy is to Expand Rich Resources. They Don't Care About Three Times Seven Equals Twenty-One. As Long as There is a Place Where They Can Make Profits and Obtain Money, They Will Do Their Best to Operate. If They Can Sweep All the Money of Our Country's People in One Go, Then They Will Definitely Use Cannon Bombs and Explosions of Military Policies to Deal With Us Again. Therefore, They First Investigate Our People's Hobbies and Habits Clearly, and Aim at the Target to Manufacture All Kinds of Items That Our People Welcome, and Transport Them for Sale. Sure Enough, As They Expected, One Ship is Sold Out After One Ship is Transported, and Ten Ships Are Sold Out After Ten Ships Are Transported, Even Hundreds and Thousands of Ships, Coming in an Endless Stream and Selling Out Completely. Therefore, Last Year, The Value of Goods Imported Into Our Country Was As High As 120 Million Yuan. Alas, Our Fathers, Brothers, and Sisters, Aren't These 120 Million Good Foreign Dollars Awarded to Them by Our Chinese Citizens? If We Comprehensively Calculate the National Population and 120 Million Yuan, That is, Each of Us Will Lose 200 Yuan. If Everyone Buys National Products and Uses National Loans, Won't These 120 Million Yuan Still Flow Within the Country? If This Compatriot Spends It, That Compatriot Will Receive It Back. No Matter What, There Is Always Hope of Returning It to the Country. Since These 120 Million Yuan Have Left the Country, There Is No Need to Wait in Vain. Last Year Has Passed, and We Still Have to Cheer Up This Year, Make a Decision, and Only Then Can We Save Our Country. In Short, in One Sentence, Please, From Today's Bad Day of 'January 28th', All Items That You Wear, Use, Eat, and Use Every Day Should Be Purchased From National Products as Much as Possible. Also, Encourage All Relatives and Friends to Buy National Products. Cheap National Products Are a Minor Matter. Poverty, Exhaustion of Wealth, National Destruction, and Death Are a Major Matter. This Is the Easiest Thing to Do. This is the Thing That Matters Most to the Future of the Family and the Country. Everyone, Take This Opportunity to Make a Decision."</p>
<p>The First Special District Jointly Issues a Commemorative Declaration:</p>
<p>The New News Agency Reports: The Citizens' Joint Association of the First Special District of This City, in Order to Commemorate the Anniversary of January 28th, Specially Notified All Citizens of the City Yesterday to Fly Flags at Half-Mast, Stop Entertainment for One Day, Participate in the Memorial Meeting of All Sectors, and Issue a Declaration to Express Grief. The Details Are Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>Stop Entertainment:</p>
<p>The Association Notified Various District Sub-Associations Yesterday, Saying, "Notification: The Second Anniversary of the January 28th Blood Battle Has Passed. This Council Has Resolved (1) That the Whole City Will Fly Flags at Half-Mast to Express Grief, (2) Stop Entertainment for One Day, (3) Participate in the Work of Reducing Rent, (4) Distribute Leaflets and Paste Slogans for Publicity, (5) Participate in the January 28th Commemorative Assembly. The Corresponding Record Is Hereby Sent to You for Your Information. Please Act Accordingly."</p>
<p>Work Hard:</p>
<p>The Association Notified All Members of the City Yesterday, Saying, "The January 28th Blood Battle is the Most Tragic History of Songhu and Has Been Two Weeks. Recalling the Past Hatred, How Can We Not Be Heartbroken? This Association Should Have a Deep Commemoration and Use It as a Remembrance. The Market is Currently in a Slump. In Order to Restore Prosperity, We Must Participate in the Rent Reduction Movement. At This Tense Work, I Hope That the Committee Members Will Supervise the Members of Their Sub-Associations to Work Together. Please Do Not Take Leave Casually During Office Hours to Avoid Delaying Important Matters. I Hope That All Comrades Will Pay Attention and Not Treat It as Something to Be Ignored."</p>
<p>[Expressing Grief in the Declaration]:</p>
<p>The Association Specially Issued the Following Mourning Declaration Yesterday to Commemorate the Second Anniversary of January 28th: Following the Destruction of International Conventions on September 18, 1931 (September 18th Incident) and the Creation of an Excuse for Armed Invasion of Our Three Northeastern Provinces, the Japanese Used Airplanes and Cannons to Disrupt Shanghai at 11:00 PM on January 28th (January 28th Incident) of the Following Year, Namely Today Two Years Ago, After Our Shanghai Mayor Wu Guonian Took Into Account the Safety of Lives and Property in Chinese and Foreign Ports and Endured Humiliation to Accept the Four Unreasonable Demands of the Japanese. After the Japanese Consul Expressed Satisfaction to the Consuls of Various Countries, He Suddenly Used Airplanes and Cannons to Disrupt Shanghai, Using the Public Concession as a Military Base, Destroying Its Historical Neutrality, and Invading Zhabei, Destroying Almost All the Prosperity of Zhabeiwan Wusong, Etc. To This Day, It Is Still in Ruins and Debris. All Our Nationals Should Be Ashamed of This and Snow It Off. After September 18th, the Lost Land of the Eastern Provinces Has Not Been Recovered, the Central Government Still Has a Declaration of Sending Troops and Planning, and Important People Still Have a Vow to Command the Army North, But the Fact of Sincere Unity Still Has a Fleeting Appearance. After January 28th, There Was the Battle of Liu Han in Shandong, the Dispute Between Uncles and Nephews in Sichuan, and the Fight Between the Two Chens in Guangdong. Those Who Have No National Concept Took the Opportunity of the Northern Resistance Against Japan to Indulge in the Massacre of Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong. The Cadres of the Party Also Divided Their Ways, Still Using the Name of Resisting Insults From Abroad to Make Trouble on the Walls. Some Even Did Not Hesitate to Use the Anti-Japanese Fame of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai to Impulsively Change the Yuan Dynasty. Although It Was Only a Few People Who Had No Regard for the Interests of the Country and the People Who Intended to Harm Others for Their Own Benefit, It Was Actually Because the Power of the Party's Centralized Control Was Not Prepared. If This Is Not Planned to Determine a National Affair, It Is Still Not Easy to Secure It. How Can We Repel Foreign Aggressors? Although It Is Subjective to See What Is First and What Is Later in Securing the Interior and Repelling Foreign Aggressors, the Centralized Control of the Country Is Strong, and Repelling Foreign Aggressors Is Securing the Interior. All Our Nationals Can Deeply Understand This Meaning, But Now That This Condition Is Not Prepared Is the Most Painful. Fortunately, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Congress Has Been Opened, and Centralized Control Is Promising. Looking Back At the Decline of Shanghai's Commerce Due to the Decline of the Inland Rural Areas, the Destruction of January 28th Is Even More Declining. Those Who Exhaust the Ponds to Fish and Burn the Forests to Shield, and Those Who Extend Their Length to Exploit and Gather Can Only Cause Collapses to Occur One After Another and Unemployment to Increase Sharply. Even the Most Busy Nanjing Road, The Shops Are Also Seven Or Zero, Unable to Pay the Huge Rent. The Landlord Sues for Sealing Up the Shop, But the Court, Which Is Deeply Aware of the Social and Economic Situation, Advises Them to Settle. This Association Has Detailed Information on the Cost of Living Index. The Prices of Shanghai's Four Items Are All Falling With the Economic Situation of the Inland and the World. The Rent Item Has Been Increasing Since January 28th. This Is Why the Houses With Equal Monopoly Nature Can Take Advantage of the Situation and Hardly Change Their Rent Amount Due to the Relationship Between Supply and Demand. The Husband Returns Rice to Live in, Which Is Related to the People's Food, and the Official Office Will Ban It to Protect the People's Livelihood. Is It Not Harmful to the People's Livelihood to Return the House to Live in, Which Is Related to the People's Livelihood for the People Who Can Live in a Good Business? We Hope That the Official Office Will Ban It, and the Best Method Is to Levy House Donations on Empty Houses, One Is to Increase Tax Revenue, and the Other Is to Promote it. The Principles of Law and Human Feelings Are All Understandable, Which Is Not a Matter of Preparation With One Move and Several Goodness. On the Day When This Association Was on the Verge of Collapse in Shanghai, In View of the Painful Events of January 28th, It Zheng Told A Group of Exploiters and Gatherers That Shanghai's Economic Lifeline Is Prosperous in the Prosperity of the Inland and the Balance of Commerce. Today, The Inland is Declining, and the Annual Trade Surplus is Huge. In Addition, The Increase in Silver Use in the United States and the Increase in Silver Prices Have Caused the East Exchange to Shrink Sharply. In the Future, There Must Be Two Major Trends: (1) Outflow of Silver and Goods; (2) Foreign Dumping. As A Result of the Outflow of Silver and Goods, Shanghai's Chips Must Be Deficient, and A Tragic Fall in House Prices Can Be Expected. Foreign Goods Dumping, National Goods Commerce, It Is Even More Difficult to Stand. Clearing Up Bankruptcies Must Follow. Only Those Who Hold the Economic Function in Shanghai and Have Foresight Can Jointly Seek to Save It. The Rent Reduction Movement is Just a Reflection of Economic Decline. If the Government Does Not Provide Assistance, the Group Will Seek Survival, Then Shanghai's Destruction Is Not Far Away. It Is Not Only a Wei Great Building That Can Show Its Greatness. If You Do Not Plan Now and Die Together, Even There Are the Paramount, the Grand Light, and the Yangtze Hotel, Etc., It Is Not a Place for Exploiters to Gather." I Hereby Declare That All Are Publicly Appraised.</p>

<p>Yesterday Morning, Central Committee Members Arrived in Shanghai Together. Wu Tiecheng Talked About the Good Impression of the Plenary Session. The Discussion of Each Case Was Down-to-Earth With an Open Mind.</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session Closed. Some Central Committee Members Left for Shanghai Together at 11:00 PM the Night Before Yesterday and Arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 AM Yesterday Morning. There Were Fourteen People, Including Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Tang Youren, Zhang Dingfan, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, Chen Qingyun, Xia Douyin, Chen Zhaoying, Yang Hu, and Miao Bin. After Mayor Wu Arrived in Shanghai, He Went to the Municipal Government in the Morning to Work as Usual. Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Is Scheduled to Go to Hankou Within One Or Two Days. The Other Committee Members Will Rest in Shanghai for A While. Ma Chaojun Did Not Come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's Speech: Reporters Called on Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government Yesterday Morning to Inquire About His Impressions of the Fourth Plenary Session. According to the Expression, The Impression Was Good and Unprecedented in Previous Meetings. (1) When Discussing Proposals at the Meeting, All Committee Members Were Able to Be Open-Minded. Each Case Was Discussed Carefully and Thoroughly. (2) All Proposals Were Strived to Be Practical and Not Advocate Empty Talk. The Political Reform Plan Proposed by the Guangdong Side Has Also Been Revised and Passed, and Will Be Implemented Separately. (3) The Enthusiasm for Attendance Was Unprecedented in Previous Meetings. The Harmonious Scene Is Enough to Realize Peaceful Unity, Solidarity, and National Salvation.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Talked About the Fact That the Reform of the Provincial System Is Underway. Chairman Chiang Will Go to Gan Within Days. There Is No Room for Reorganization of the 19th Route Army.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Came to Shanghai by Night Train From Beijing at 7:30 Yesterday Morning After Attending the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing. He Returned to Albert's Residence to Rest. At About 9 O'Clock, Chen Yi, the New Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, Visited to Discuss Various Issues Concerning the Aftermath of the Fujian Province and Had a Pleasant Conversation for Two Hours. Mr. Zhang Then Received Reporters From Various Newspapers and Scheduled to Stay in Shanghai for Two Days Before Returning to E. The Talks of Mr. Zhang Are Recorded Separately as Follows:</p>
<p>Reform of the Provincial System:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang First Said That the Proposal on Reforming the Provincial System Was Jointly Proposed by Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Himself, But It Was Only Based on the Decisions of the Three Plenary Sessions and Added Organizational Opinions. After Being Passed by the General Assembly, It Was Submitted to the Central Political Conference to Draft the Organizational Law, Which Will Be Implemented on A Regular Basis. As for the Content of the Organization, There Were About Two Opinions Discussed At That Time: (1) Those Who Advocated That the Provincial Governor Should Have a Deputy Provincial Governor and Those Who Advocated That There Was No Need to Have A Deputy Provincial Governor; (2) The Departments Under the Provincial Government Still Used the Name of the Department, and Some Advocated That the Names of the Departments Such As Education and Construction Still Use the Name of the Department, While Others Such as Civil Affairs and Finance Were Changed to Departments. There Was Still No Body Decision, and It Was Also Submitted to the Central Political Conference for Detailed Discussion.</p>
<p>The End of the Rebellion:</p>
<p>The Issue of the Reorganization of the 19th Route Army Was Not Mentioned in the Plenary Session. Because the Army Has Suffered Heavy Casualties Since the Battles of Yanping Shuikou Gutian and Other Battles and Has Become Unformed, The Number of Those Who Survive Now Is Only A Few Thousand, With No Room for Reorganization. There Are Rumors That the Army Will Be Reorganized and Reorganized Under the Command of Dai Ji, Etc. Apart From the News in the Newspapers, I Have Not Heard of It. As for the Saying That the Southwest Asked the Central Government to Retain the Name of the 19th Route Army, It Is Not a Fact. The Central Army's Anti-Rebellion Military Affairs Can Be Completely Resolved, And the Southwest Authorities Have Not Made Such A Request to the Central Government. Chen Jitang Appointed Li Yangjing and Huang Renhuan As the Commanders and Deputy Commanders of the Guangdong-Fujian Border Defense, Which Was Approved by Chairman Chiang Before This Appointment. The Purpose Is to Block the Defeated Army.</p>
<p>The Recent Situation of E Government:</p>
<p>Regarding the Recent Situation in E Province, According to Mr. Zhang, The Expenses in E Province Are Very Difficult. However, In the Past Year, Regular Political Expenses Can Still Be Met With Difficulty. However, Because the Provincial Expenses Were Tight in the Past, All Facilities Had No Development, Especially the Education Expenses, Which Must Be Expanded. Therefore, It Has Been Decided That the 200,000 Yuan in Monthly Subsidies From the Central Government Should Be Used As Education Expenses. A Committee for the Safekeeping of Education Expenses Will Be Established to Manage and Distribute It Independently. It Has Now Been Submitted to the Central Government for Approval and Has Requested That the National Tax of E Province Be Directly Allocated to Avoid the Procedures of Applying to the Ministry of Finance. The Aftermath of Recovering the Bandit Areas Requires A Lot of Money, Which Has Been Planned by the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression, So There Is No Need for E Province to Raise Money by Itself.</p>
<p>The Bandits in E Province Have Been Eliminated:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Also Said That Regarding the Military Affairs of Suppressing Bandits in E Province, In the Eastern Part of E Province, There Were Thousands of Bandits From Ye Jinbo. Since the Painful Suppression, There Are Only 300 People Left, Which Is Not Difficult to Completely Eliminate. The Bandit Units in the Western Part of E Province Have Also Been Defeated and Eliminated One After Another. As for Other Scattered Bandits, They Are Now Actively Being Eliminated. The Localities of the Whole Province Are Quite Safe and Have Not Changed At All.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Finally Said That After the Fourth Plenary Session, There Was Absolutely No Change in the Heads of Various Yuan Departments. The Rumors Outside Were Probably Created by Some Intentions. As for the Issue of Zhang Xueliang's Whereabouts, The Central Government Is Still Considering It and Has Not Made A Decision. I Will Stay in Shanghai for Two Days and Then Return to E. Chairman Chiang Is Still Staying in Beijing and Will Go to Gan Within Days, With No Need to Go to Fujian Again.</p>
<p>Chen Yi, Chairman of Fujian, Will Board the Ship Tonight and Leave Shanghai for Fujian Tomorrow Morning.</p>
<p>Chen Yi, the New Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, Was Ordered to Go to Fujian to Take Up His New Post. After Arriving in Shanghai the Other Day, He Was Allowed to Officially Take Office on the First of Next Month. According to Chen's Family Members Yesterday, Chen Will Probably Board the Ninghai Warship Tonight (28th) and Leave Shanghai the Next Morning to Go to Fujian to Take Up His New Post With Li Shijia, Chen Ticheng, Zheng Zhenwen and Other Provincial Committee Members. Also, At About 10 O'Clock Yesterday Morning, Mr. Chen Went to Albert Road to Visit Zhang Qun, Chairman of E Province, and Discussed Various Issues Concerning the Aftermath of Fujian Province and Researched Them. The Two Discussed for About An Hour Before Mr. Chen Resigned.</p>
<p>The Test Flight of the Southwest Line, Anlisheng and Other Former History, Flew to Chengdu.</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation Received a Wireless Telegraph Message in Western Language From Anlisheng, Chief Pilot of the Test Flight of the Southwest Line, and Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Aviation Group, From Chengdu the Night Before Yesterday. The Telegraph Message Was Very Simple and Only Said, "Flew to Chengdu at 5:10 PM on January 26." As for Whether Guiyang Had Been There and When It Would Go East, They Were Both Omitted. As of Last Night, There Was No Subsequent Telegraph to Shanghai.</p>

Huang Gongwang, the instructor from the county party headquarters, and Zhang Bing, the supervisor from the county government, attended.

The meeting adjourned, and the by-election for officials would be held on the 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Ningbo Renji Hospital Director Change <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Renji Hospital was established with funds raised by Ningbo gentry in Shanghai, such as Jin Tingsun. The construction of the hospital building and the purchase of various medical equipment cost 300,000 yuan. Dr. Dong Dingsong was hired to preside over the hospital affairs and devoted himself wholeheartedly to the hospital's facilities. Over the past four years, remarkable achievements have been made. It is now heard that Dr. Dong believes that the hospital's foundation is solid and that gradual progress will be easy in the future. He intends to take this opportunity to retire and pursue other medical plans in Shanghai. He has submitted his resignation to Jin Tingsun, the hospital director. Mr. Jin, seeing his firm intention to resign, has accepted his request. Dr. Dong completed the handover procedures a few days ago and went to Shanghai with his family. It is said that Dr. Liu Qijing has been hired to preside over the hospital's medical affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Petition to Preserve Water Conservancy by the People of Eight Townships in Ningbo <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Donglongtan Weir water inlet in Fenghua County has always been the lifeline of the farmland in eight townships, including Longxi, Daqiao, and Minghua. It is also the source of drinking water for most of the residents in the county, making it extremely important. It irrigates over 30,000 acres of farmland, making it the fertile fields of Fenghua County. Currently, the Fenghai Highway is being constructed, and to save on bridge construction costs, the roadbed will block the weir water. Moreover, without considering the elevation, the waterway is being altered. This has caused great alarm among the people of the eight townships, who have negotiated with the road construction site. Although Director Liu has agreed to add concrete culverts, it will not actually help. Therefore, the heads of the eight townships have elected representatives, including Zhang Zongming, the head of Minghua Township, Fang Xiang Sheng, the head of Daqiao Town, and Wang Yeguo, the head of Longxi Township. They have jointly submitted a petition based on two points: (1) The county's streams are full of sand and gravel, and the county often experiences heavy rain. The rapid currents and sand accumulation make it impossible for the stream water to enter the fields through the concrete culverts. (2) After heavy rains, sand and gravel flow downstream, turning today's deep pools into sand piles tomorrow. If concrete culverts are built, it will be difficult to adjust the elevation. If the sand piles are higher than the culverts, how can the stream water enter the fields through the culverts? (The original petition is long and not recorded here.) They are petitioning the Construction Department and Highway Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The people of the townships believe that this matter concerns their vital interests and will not stop until their requests to maintain the original river and build a separate oblique bridge are granted.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Nantong Liuqiao Bandit Leader Sentenced to Death <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Miao Wendui, the bandit leader in Liuqiao District, gathered crowds to burn, loot, and cause trouble, and also resisted and injured many police and militia members. He was captured by the security regiment and confessed to the county government without denial. He has been sentenced to death and the sentence has been submitted to the provincial government for approval and execution.</p>
<p>[P Restore the Telephone Service in the Eastern Townships &gt;</p>
<p>In the eastern townships of Tongyi County, the telephone poles were cut off during the previous banditry. To facilitate communication, the county government has instructed the telephone bureau to install new equipment. Once the project is completed, the telephone service will be restored.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Changshu Ice Thaws and Transportation Resumes <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Due to the severe cold weather in the past few days, the rivers in various places froze. The steamers that relied on them for transportation were unable to pass on the 21st. As a result, mail was not delivered here, and the Shanghai newspapers did not arrive, causing a communication breakdown. With the year-end accounting period approaching, businesses were greatly affected. The Public Security Bureau made every effort to urge the steamer companies to break the ice and allow passage. As of the 24th, the Su-Chang and Kun-Chang routes have been cleared, and the weather has also warmed up slightly. The steamers immediately resumed operation, so the mail and newspapers of that day have arrived in Changshu.</p>

<p>The Ningbo China National Goods Bazaar is organized by well-known major national goods factories in Shanghai. The methods are very complete. Since the active preparation, in less than a month, the internal has been largely accomplished. As of today, the participating factories include the Family Industry Cooperative, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Renyu Socks Factory, Xiangxing Leather Goods Factory, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, Dalong Woolen Fabric Factory, Guohua Silk Weaving Factory, Yutai Thermos Bottle Factory, Tongji Glass Factory, Huaou Candy Factory, Shanghai Bakelite Factory, Fanlong Knitting Factory, Tongxing Industrial Cooperative, Yingyin Weaving Factory, Shunfeng Socks Factory, Yitai Refined Steel Factory, Linfeng Cloth Factory, Lie Feng Silk Factory, Sanjin Shoes and Hats Factory, Lao Fuji Copperware Factory, Yuanchang Factory, and more than 30 others. However, it is said that the soap and candle, silk scarf, stationery, clock, toy, and porcelain sections are still being solicited and negotiated. If national goods factories in Shanghai are interested in cooperating in the above sections, they can go to the preparatory office on the third floor of 19 Sijing Road for consultation and participation. The earlier the better, to avoid regrets. It is also learned that the bazaar is scheduled to open in February of the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>[P Zhaoshangju Yu'an Ship in Xiamen Encountered Danger &gt;</p>
<p>Loss of over 10,000 yuan... Can arrive in three days</p>
<p>The Zhaoshangju Nanyang liner Yu'an, which travels the Shanghai-Guangdong-Xiamen route, was carrying goods back to Shanghai this time when its machinery was damaged and its axle broke while traveling in the waters off Xiamen. The ship remained on the sea awaiting rescue. Yesterday, the bureau urgently dispatched Jiahe to tow it. It is estimated that it can return to Shanghai within three days. The losses are quite large. The situation is detailed as follows: The Yu'an, which encountered danger at sea, was leased by the Zhaoshangju from the Yu'an Shipping Company and assigned to the Nanhua route. The hull of the ship is very strong. This time, it carried goods from Guangdong back to Shanghai. It first arrived in Xiamen to load more goods. On the 24th, it departed from Xiamen. Unexpectedly, while traveling in the waters off Xiamen, between Xiamen and Fuzhou, at night, the ship's axle suddenly broke and the machinery was completely destroyed. The ship could not move. There was nothing to be done on the spot. It had to anchor in the sea area and send a telegram to Shanghai for help, so that it could be towed to the nearest coast for repair to avoid the danger of wind and waves.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram for Assistance The owner of the Yu'an Ship urgently sent a wireless telegram to Shanghai to report the incident, requesting the Shanghai General Bureau to quickly send a tugboat to rescue it and tow the Yu'an to the nearest coast for repair. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately informed Zhao Yuntai, the owner of the Yu'an Company, to discuss the procedures for dispatching a tugboat for rescue. After a night of discussion, a decision was finally made yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Jiahe Rescues The Yu'an has been without its axle since the night of the 24th, which is now three days. If a large tugboat is hired from Shanghai to rescue it, it will take at least another three days. The wind and waves at sea are unpredictable, so it is difficult to delay further. Therefore, as a result of the discussion, it was decided to telegraph the Jiahe ship in Fuzhou to go to that location as soon as possible and tow the Yu'an to Shanghai for major repairs. This telegram has been sent to the two ships yesterday afternoon. The Jiahe ship can arrive that night. It will also transport food to the Yu'an to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Amount of Loss The reporter met Zhao Yuntai, who said that the loss of the Yu'an's axle and damaged machinery, together with the dispatch of tugboats and round-trip telegrams, would cost at least 10,000 yuan. The Yu'an has never had an accident since it was leased by the Zhaoshangju. This time, the machinery and axle must be completely replaced when it arrives in Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within three days.</p>

<p>There are many nail factories in Shanghai, and the soap powder used for drawing lead wire is all imported. According to the customs import table, the amount is huge, and the outflow of money is countless. Rui Gongxia, a native of Ningbo, studied chemical engineering in Germany to resist foreign countries and recover rights and interests. After returning to China in August of last year, he raised funds to establish Zhenya Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. He also devoted himself to research and invented domestic lead wire drawing soap powder, named domestic "Las Powder". It has now been successfully launched. The powder is better than imported products and the price is three times cheaper. It is truly a new undertaking in the national goods year.</p>

<p>Police Still Capturing Major Thieves</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Hongtai pawnshop at 624 Changchun Lane, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, was broken into by several thieves who dug through the wall and stole all the gold jewelry, clothing, and silver dollars, worth over 10,000 yuan, before fleeing. The pawnshop manager, Jin Maoqin, reported the case to the police and requested an investigation. Around 7:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Hua detectives Ye Chuanxi and Liu Qingsheng from the General Patrol House learned that the gang was dividing the loot at 6 Huashou Lane, Zhoushan Road. They immediately coordinated with Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to arrest them, but the thieves had already fled after hearing the news. Only an old woman, Cao Zhangshi, was arrested. Seven bullets, several iron tools used for digging through the door, and original stolen clothes and jewelry worth over 5,000 yuan were found in the house. They were all taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the police were conducting a thorough investigation and arresting major thieves, so he requested a postponement of the trial. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Court, approved the request and ordered Cao Zhangshi to be detained for a further review.</p>

During the graduation ceremony this winter vacation, the French Consul General in Shanghai specifically awarded gold medals to the three teachers to show his admiration and commemorate their service. More than a dozen guests were present that day, including the French Consul General, the supervisor of the Sacred Heart Education Association, the chairman of the French Concession Education Committee, the director Zhang Xiaolin, the chief translator of the French Consulate Zhang Wenbin, the president of Aurora University Hu Wenyao, and the school's Western principal, the principal of the Western Children's Public School, the director of the Health Department, and the French Army Commander in Shanghai, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Fifth Branch of the Second Municipal Federation Requests Prohibition of Dog Racing and Jai Alai <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Letter Sent to Taxpayers' Association and Other Organizations Yesterday</p>
<p>The Fifth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation in Tangjiawan, French Concession, sent letters to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Municipal Federation regarding the issue of dog racing and jai alai, requesting the French authorities to strictly prohibit them. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, the matter of requesting the prohibition of dog racing and jai alai has been repeatedly proposed by members of our association. Now, in accordance with the decision of the fifteenth executive committee meeting of our association, we send a letter requesting your association to send a letter to the French Municipal Council and submit it to the French Consul General, Mr. Meriel, for strict prohibition. We also send a letter to the Chinese Directors, making suggestions to the French Municipal Council, because dog racing and jai alai are using entertainment as a pretext to lead the public into gambling. Gambling is a criminal act, and the provisions of Articles 278 to 281 of our country's criminal law are very clear and should be strictly prohibited, but they are allowed to be open, which is especially harmful to society. Moreover, dog racing has long been strictly prohibited in the Public Concession, but in the French Concession, not only is there no clear prohibition, but it is openly allowed, which is deeply bewildering. The prosperity of the people's livelihood is affected by the safety and stability of the region. Those in power should guide the people to diligence and thrift, not tempt them to take risks and gamble. There is no difference in this principle in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. Shanghai is the center of factories in the country, and the majority of the people are laborers. In recent years, due to the economic downturn, various industries have declined, and the hardships of life are more severe than in other places. Even without unexpected consumption, they are already in a precarious situation. The jai alai and dog racing exploit the people's weak psychology, tempting them with the prospect of a hundred or a thousandfold return. All eyes are focused on this great opportunity. Those who enter the field appreciate the low cost and admire the quick way to get rich. Even women and children, peddlers and coolies, even those who cannot afford to eat, want to do everything possible to scrape together their hard-earned money in order to try their luck. The harm is extremely serious. In recent years, with the special permission of the French authorities as protection, the monthly income of these two places is no less than millions of dollars. This is all the money that the lower and middle classes need to maintain their lives. In a shift, they are cleverly and forcibly seized and fall into the hands of others. If this exploitation continues, the lives of the people will become more difficult, and chaos will arise. The relationship to local security is not insignificant. Moreover, knowing that success is difficult, they have no choice but to drink poison and resign themselves to their fate. Even if they fail in one strike, the funds are squandered, and they still hope to recover their losses elsewhere. Therefore, once a commoner enters the shell, they will never be able to extricate themselves for the rest of their lives. And because of this, there are frequent reports of people who are bankrupt and take risks. There have also been many cases of business embezzlement and fraudulent behavior due to gambling debts. Its poison is comparable to morphine. Although a small portion of the income is used to subsidize one or two charitable causes, weighing the pros and cons, the gains do not compensate for the losses. We hope that you will submit a request for a limited time to prohibit it, so as to show the determination to eradicate evil, and it will also be helpful to refresh politics. Hundreds of millions of people in Shanghai will be truly blessed."</p>
<h3 id="e111">A Young Traveler Commits Suicide by Taking Poison in the Dongya Hotel <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>In the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road, a young man wearing a suit and about 20 years old checked in the afternoon before yesterday. The hotel cashier led him to room 447 on the fourth floor. The young man wrote his surname as Wei, his name as Wufei, from Beiping, a student, and paid the room fee of three yuan on the spot. He closed the door and went to sleep in the evening. Until 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he had not yet gotten up. The tea server went to knock on the door to ask if the room was still needed. Unexpectedly, there was no response for a long time, which aroused suspicion. He quickly found a way to open the door and enter the room. He saw that the young man's face was pale and his breath was weak. He had been unconscious for a long time. The tea server and others quickly reported to the cashier, who in turn reported to the Old Gate Police Station. They rushed to send an ambulance to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he had taken too much poison and died on the way. The body was transferred to the autopsy office to report to the court for inspection. An investigation was also launched to identify the corpse.</p>

<p>Bei'er, the Western Patrol Chief of the Old Gate Police Station, and Xu Ajin, the Chinese Patrol No. 642, went to the third floor of 431 Zhejiang Road on the 5th of this month to arrest a prostitute. At that time, a woman named Wang Xiuzhen fell to her death. The police believed that the woman had jumped down and died, while Wang's husband, Gan Zhigang, and mother, Wang Guo, accused Patrol Xu of pushing Xiuzhen down and causing her death.

<h3 id="e116">Police Officer's Wife Dies of Coal Poisoning <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Ma Gao, a 21-year-old woman from Xuzhou, was the wife of Ma Juli, who was a Chinese patrol officer No. 136 in the Tilanqiao Prison. They had been married for five years and had a good relationship. Ms. Ma gave birth to a daughter two weeks ago and was weak as a result. She had also been feeling headaches recently, so she was bedridden during the day. The day before yesterday, Ma, seeing that his wife was weak due to the cold weather, prepared a coal stove for her and placed it in her bedroom. At about 2:00 p.m., Ms. Ma suddenly became faint. Ma was extremely alarmed and sent his wife to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and she died. The hospital reported to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered investigator Shen Binkui to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Autopsy Office. Yesterday morning, Zhang Junqing, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Gong Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to the statement of the deceased's husband, Ma Juli, 23 years old, "My bedroom is behind the living room. I prepared a coal stove that day and initially placed it in the room. Later, because my wife walked to the living room for lunch, I moved the coal stove out to keep her warm. After she sat there for about an hour, she went back to the room to sleep. She had no other illnesses on weekdays, only headaches after giving birth." Mr. Zhang obtained the statement and ordered that the deceased, Ma Gao, female, died of coal poisoning. The body was handed over to her husband, Ma Juli, to claim and bury.</p>

<p>Gu Yang, the madam of the Guanchunlou brothel at 27, Lane 229, Xiaohua Garden, Zhejiang Road, has recently been sued by Wei Sun, a woman from Jiangdu, who hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to accuse Gu of forcing her daughter Alin (16 years old) into prostitution and coercing her to be raped by a customer named Zhu, etc., in the First Court.

<h3 id="e118">Wu Qin'e Falls Into Prostitution <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Found in Wu Naiquan's House</p>
<p>Gao Qingtang, Shen Yinzhang, Li Erbao, and Zhu Naiquan from Yangzhou colluded to deceive Wang Wu, a young woman from Jiaxing, 18 years old, and her younger sister, Wu Qin'e, 16 years old, to come to Shanghai between December 29th and stayed in a hotel, intending to sell Qin'e. On the 10th of the month, Wang Zhusheng, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and Detective Zhang Desheng, learned of the matter and secretly went to Zhejiang Hotel on Hankou Road, 700 Edward Road, and 837 Tiantong Road to arrest Gao and the other three and rescue Wang Wu. However, Wu Qin'e was nowhere to be found. Gao and the other four were sent to the First District Court for interrogation and detention. In the meantime, Wu Qin'e was found in Zhu Naiquan's house at 700 Edward Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui came to Criminal Court No. 2 for interrogation. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that during the postponement, it was found that the defendants Gao Qingtang and Shen Yinzhang had told Wang Wu and Wu Qin'e in their hometown that they would take them to Shanghai for a trip, and bought train tickets for them to board at the Xiashi Station. After arriving in Shanghai, they first stayed at the Wenminxing Inn on Edward Road. That night, Gao tried to force himself on Wu Qin'e but failed and tried to sell her. (It was found that Qin'e was already married, but her husband died more than a year ago.) However, there were no customers. The next day, Gao returned to his hometown and invited his neighbor, Li Erbao, the defendant, to come to Shanghai and moved into the Yuanyuan Inn at 223 Fuzhou Road. Li took Qin'e to a relative of his named Yang on Baker Road and explained the intention. Yang saw that the matter was inappropriate and immediately refused. Later, a person named Zhang Lianqing took Qin'e to the defendant Zhu Naiquan at 700 Edward Road, wanting to buy her for 300 yuan. It was found that Yang was a pimp in a low-class brothel, and he intended to pay 250 yuan for Qin'e because she was petite and exquisite. However, he had no money and left her there temporarily. The cheongsam that Qin'e is wearing is the old one worn by his 17-year-old daughter. The clothes are the symbol of a prostitute, and it is possible that she has already engaged in prostitution. Judge Liu then questioned each of the defendants and ordered them to be detained separately pending a further hearing.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Regarding the meeting place of the Second Anniversary Commemoration of the January 28th Anti-Japanese War, this association has designated it to be at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Group and has published advertisements in various newspapers to announce it. However, upon reviewing the newspapers and evening papers of the past two days, the news about the meeting address has been mistakenly published as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Auditorium, which is very puzzling. It should be corrected immediately to avoid ambiguity. In addition to distributing it separately, we hereby inform you and request that you correct it in tonight's newspapers. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, January 27th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: Regarding the news about "Display of Two-Headed Snake" in your newspaper's local news column on the 26th, which stated that it was approximately one chi (foot) long, we believe that the reporter made a mistake in writing. In addition to posting a notice of correction at the entrance of our park, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will publish this letter to conform to the facts and avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Zoo, January 27th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: According to Mr. Hou Guohua, it has been reported that in the local news column of the Shenbao on January 27th, there was a report about Hou Guohua being accused of seducing a young girl. The content is not factual. Tang Xiuying, also known as Wang Xiaqing, had previously lived with Guohua for a period of time, but later broke off the relationship because she had an affair. Guohua has never shown any intention of marrying a woman who is already married. Her son was previously identified by the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court as not having been produced by Tang Xiuying, so he is obviously not her biological son. Unexpectedly, in her anger, she fabricated accusations. Since a counterclaim has been filed, the newspaper listened to only one side and made untrue records, which is detrimental to reputation. Therefore, we are specially entrusting your lawyers to send a letter on behalf of the client, requesting a correction to rectify public opinion. Sincerely, Lawyers Wu Guochang and Sun Zuji, January 27th.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Fundamental Problem of Reading <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>(1) High ambitions in reading and no standards for choosing subjects to study ...... I am a reader of your library, and thanks to your library, I have developed my reading habit. In the beginning, it was nothing more than aimless browsing, but because I love books like my life, I almost want to read the best books in the world before I am satisfied; but due to the pressure of the environment, I have to be greatly disappointed. ... (Letter from Zhang Tingshan)</p>
<p>...... After reading the "Reading Problems" on the 13th and 14th of this month, I am very depressed because I am a person (lost in the sea of ​​learning). I like to study all kinds of subjects and I am interested in them; I like to study social sciences, because it can tell me the relationship between people, and I also love natural sciences, because it can explain natural phenomena. Therefore, I am just like Mencius said, "I want both bear's paws and fish", but from the gentlemen's answers, I know that "you can't have both." But which one to give up and which one to take, I really don't have the courage to decide. I am like being trapped in the abyss of a love triangle. I love the two girls equally. How can I weigh them and specialize in one subject? But, you want me to decide on a subject, and in fact, you can only let me study one subject, so I will reluctantly give up natural science and study social science ...... (Letter from Dong Yuan)</p>
<p>Reading the above two letters reminds us of what the Japanese writer Natsume Kinnosuke said. He said··</p>
<p>"When you are young and strong, before you can make some contributions to your own specialized studies, you think that you must be proficient in all aspects, and you must read through thousands of years of books in ancient and modern times. If you have to do this, then you will be old and you will never have a period of proficiency in all aspects. People like me, I really can't say that I am proficient in the entire English study. Probably in another two or thirty years, I will still be unable to understand it." ..." (See Yu Dafu's Literature People's slight reference)</p>
<p>Natsume Kinnosuke's words are indeed reading experience; and we have also solemnly advised readers on "several issues about choosing subjects"·· I hope they do not choose too many subjects, "Because when ambitions are too big, disappointments will definitely increase. As a result, you will become self-abandoning and fail to do anything. Therefore, the most fearful thing for us beginners is to sing high-sounding but impractical tunes." (Mr. Yu Dafu's words)</p>
<p>Therefore, from a practical point of view, from the point of view of reading efficiency, it is impossible to have extravagant expectations when reading at the beginning. But from these two letters, we can also see: the strong desire for knowledge and the huge ambitions of reading in every young person; they want to read every book and want to understand every event and every phenomenon in the universe. Therefore, as Dong Yuan's letter said, beginners have no love or hate for various subjects and treat them equally. This is an unstoppable hope, although it will be subject to practical obstacles, but it cannot be eliminated after all. Therefore, we know that it is proper and necessary to ask beginners to narrow the scope of research; but for this reason, we ask them to choose subjects to study and tell them that too much desire for knowledge will lead to failure. Not only will it reduce their interest in research, but their choice of subjects will also be standardless, because there is no special reason for this choice.</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not want beginners to immediately study by subject, but advocate that they first read some basic and common books. (Conclusions and measures will be announced on the 30th)</p>
<p>By mail: Mr. Zhang Xianzong and Zhu Jiaming, please send the most recent contact address to the library for reply.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Detailed Record of the Second Day of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Education Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Morning Meeting</p>
<p>The second annual meeting of the Chinese Education Association was held on the morning of the 25th at the Central University South Gaoyuan, presided over by Chen Jiantiao. The news was reported yesterday. The following resolutions were made on this day in addition to reading the papers: (1) A proposal to submit the new standards for primary and secondary school courses promulgated by the Ministry for research (with a proposal to organize a committee to conduct group research and report the results at the next annual meeting). It was resolved to designate several primary and secondary schools and recommend several members to jointly organize a committee to study the new curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools and submit a report on the research results at the next annual meeting. (2) A temporary motion that the central government's education funds should account for a certain percentage of the total national revenue and that local education funds should account for a certain percentage of the total local revenue and that the government should be requested to stipulate this. It was resolved that the board of directors would appoint a committee to collect materials on the percentage of education funds in various countries and the percentage of education funds in various provinces in China, conduct research, report to the board of directors, and make suggestions to the government. (3) A motion that the current joint examination system should be discussed and resolved urgently. Members such as Shao Shuangqiu and Ma Ketan expressed their opinions. Wu Yan reported the results of the Ministry of Education's investigation of education departments in various provinces and the general opinions other than administrative ones. They felt that the joint examination for primary schools was difficult and that the joint examination for middle schools was necessary, but the method needed to be changed. The Ministry of Education has now temporarily exempted primary schools from the joint examination, and the method for the joint examination for middle schools has been revised and announced. Therefore, the joint examination system seems to be no longer a problem, only a research problem on the method (such as the necessary materials, subjects, and scoring and scoring methods for the joint examination). Huang Jianzhong said that he did not agree with the primary school joint examination system, but the middle school joint examination, especially the senior high school general course, made the level uniform, which facilitated further studies. He also cited the joint examination system in British middle schools for explanation. The chairman said that this case would be handed over to the board of directors to send personnel to jointly study with the Chinese Measurement and Examination Association so that there would be considerable results. The name does not necessarily have to be "Research on the Joint Examination System", but it can be a method of measuring students' grades, which will be determined by the two associations in the future. Everyone agreed. (4) How should the direction and curriculum of university education departments be stipulated? Because this case was already a central research question in yesterday's discussion topic, it was no longer discussed. (5) A proposal to organize a "National Spirit" teaching material committee to engage in research and collect national spirit teaching materials so that they can be incorporated into textbooks (with a proposal that the committee be organized by the association and work with the education departments of various universities to engage in research and editing so that they can be incorporated into Chinese language, history, and civics textbooks for primary and secondary schools in the future). It was resolved to hand it over to the board of directors for consideration.</p>

The discussion of association affairs then began. (1) A motion on the date and location of the next annual meeting of the association. Zhuang Zexuan said that the association's annual meeting only lasted for two days. In order to conduct more research, he suggested that the association and a university jointly organize a summer seminar during the annual meeting to concentrate on studying problems and give specialized lectures, imitating the methods of the Fujian Education Department. First, contact which university to jointly organize the summer seminar and then hold the meeting there. Yuan Dunli said that he was a professor at Beijing Normal University.

The members discussed the location problem and submitted five votes. As a result, Beijing (28 people raised their hands), Hangzhou (16), Wuxi (10), Lushan (7), and Qingdao (6). The majority advocated that Beijing be the first location and Hangzhou be the second location. The board of directors was asked to decide on one. Zheng Xiaocang advocated adding Wuxi to the board of directors. Zhuang Zeyi and Chen Jianxiao both advocated handing all five locations to the board of directors, writing down the number of people who voted, arranging the order, and letting the board of directors designate them.

<p>The Jinan University turmoil has been raging for a month. After the board of directors decided to ask the Ministry of Education to send Zheng Hongnian to Nanyang to investigate educational affairs, and the ministry sent someone to temporarily act as president, the Ministry of Education sent Shen Pengfei, Director of Higher Education, to act as president, which has come to an end. It is now learned that Zheng Hongnian has expressed his intention not to serve and sent a telegram to welcome Shen Pengfei to take office quickly. Shen is scheduled to come to Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 29th) to discuss the handover of the acting position.</p>

<p>Zheng Hongnian telegraphed to the central government yesterday, requesting the Ministry of Education to send personnel to verify the situation of school management and financial status in the past seven years. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: To the Central Executive Committee, Hongnian personally founded Jinan University at the end of the Qing Dynasty. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, he was ordered to return to be the president of the university, starting from laying the foundation until completing the university. He served as president twice, and in the middle, he devoted himself to the Party, still wholeheartedly supporting it as a member of the board of directors. Therefore, since the establishment of the university, the relationship has never been interrupted. Sun Yat-sen said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution." Hongnian followed Sun Yat-sen and was deeply grateful for his special knowledge. He believed that he had the honor of founding an overseas Chinese school. If he could carry it forward, he would be able to repay Sun Yat-sen and comfort his unfinished wish. Therefore, he rushed around in difficulties and did not dare to complain. In the past, the national treasury was depleted. Whenever the school funds were tight, even if he pawned his property, he would not regret it. He secretly did this in his ignorance. Now that the scale has been roughly completed, he hopes to make fewer mistakes. However, the academic atmosphere is like this, and Hongnian's sincerity is not believed. What else can he say? He doesn't care about leaving or staying, but he should clarify right and wrong. Regarding Hongnian's situation in school management and the actual financial situation in the seven years since his return, after President Shen arrives at the school and assumes his responsibilities, I respectfully ask your committee to inform the Ministry of Education to send personnel to verify it immediately. If Hongnian is indeed negligent, he is willing to accept the most severe punishment to uphold the discipline of the Party and the country. He is extremely frightened when sending this telegram. Zheng Hongnian kowtows. In addition, in the past, school funds for Jinan University were depleted, and Zheng Hongnian managed to transfer funds to keep the school running without interruption. Now that someone has been appointed to act as president, he specially</p>

<p>Here is a copy of his letter to Sun Zhesheng, Executive Director, Chen Lifu, Executive Director, and the Ministry of Education: Dear sirs, Due to the large amount of temporary funds owed by the Ministry of Finance to our school, we owe Xinghua Company 16,065 yuan for instruments and Shenchang Foreign Company 6,000 yuan for electrical machinery. The principal and interest of the loan from the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank is about 30,000 yuan. These funds are all guaranteed by Hongnian in his personal name. Now the creditors are urging us to pay urgently. The Xinghua Shenchang debt must be paid off in February due to the contract relationship. Therefore, I specially write to inform you and ask you to discuss with the Ministry of Finance to allocate 50,000 yuan from the funds owed to our school as soon as possible so that the above-mentioned debts can be settled as soon as possible, so as to preserve credit and avoid being dragged down. In addition, the outstanding debts have been reported to the Ministry of Education for the record. Combined statement.</p>

<p>Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education believes that the recent turmoil at Jinan University was caused by a small number of students involved in incidents whose actions have indeed exceeded the norms. If they are not strictly investigated and dealt with, it will not be enough to rectify the academic atmosphere. He has now appointed Lei Zhen, Director of General Affairs, and Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, to investigate and identify the students who caused the incidents and presided over the turmoil, together with representatives of the board of directors, and submit them to the ministry for strict punishment.

<p>Scheduling a Meeting with the Education Community to Discuss the Education Funding Independence Movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association held its 21st board meeting at its office on Fangji Road at 3 PM yesterday.

The meeting was chaired by Huang Zaoxiong and recorded by Zhang Lichun. (A) Report Items: (1) The Executive Yuan replied that the Boxer Indemnity had been decided at the Boxer Indemnity agency meeting to report monthly after the end of the following year. Whether the Boxer Indemnity had been used to set up a Chinese international library in Geneva is currently being urged by the Sino-French Education Fund Committee to reply. (2) The Education Bureau instructed that, in accordance with the central interpretation, should current staff members attend or be present at member meetings or representative meetings held by people's organizations, please be informed. (3) The Education Bureau instructed that the case of Cao Youguang and Che Hanyi, which was submitted for severe punishment, has been separately sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification, please be informed. (B) Discussion Items: (1) The request from the Sixth District Education Association to forward a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the Public Utilities Bureau to abolish the school enrollment advertising tax to avoid hindering the popularization of education was resolved. It was resolved to check the previous letter from the Public Utilities Bureau and forward it to the Municipal Government. (2) The letter from Xu Huimin, a staff member of the Third District Education Association, requesting to establish a private school within the scope of the Third District, was resolved to approve the establishment and handle the subsidy method in accordance with the previous case.

(6) Should the association's private schools have a winter vacation? The resolution was passed. The vacation will start on January 29th for one week. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Municipal Education Bureau Promulgates Measures to Supervise School Enrollment <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued instructions yesterday to municipal and registered private secondary schools, stating that school enrollment must go through entrance exams to assess whether students have the appropriate academic ability, which is extremely important. In order to prevent malpractices, schools must submit a report to the bureau in advance so that personnel can be sent to supervise the exams at the time. The bureau issued a notice to all schools for compliance in May of the 19th year of the Republic of China. However, with the passage of time, schools have often gone their own way in enrollment and entrance exams, failing to comply with the order to report. This is not appropriate. The bureau has now specifically revised the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Provisional Measures for Supervising Secondary School Enrollment, which will be promulgated and implemented immediately. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government for the record, all schools are ordered to comply with these measures for each enrollment and entrance exam.

<p>Starting from August of This Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued instructions yesterday to municipal elementary schools, stating that the budget for regular expenses for municipal elementary schools in the 22nd year of the Republic of China has not yet been approved. Therefore, starting from August, the monthly expenses will be temporarily issued and received in accordance with the old budget. Therefore, the monthly reports have been temporarily postponed. Now that the budget for regular expenses for municipal elementary schools this year has been approved, all the expenses that were short-issued each month starting from August have been fully reissued and received. The monthly expense calculation data for each school should be reported on time for review and transfer.

<p>At the Invitation of the Rotary Club Yesterday</p>
<p>Dr. Sattiah, President of Yenching University in Beiping, is an American who grew up in China, knows Chinese psychology well, and speaks fluent Chinese. He can be called an American of China. He lectured at the Rotary Club yesterday on "Chinese University Students." He first outlined the employment problems of university students in various countries. Only 30% of university students in the United States can find jobs, and Europe is slightly the same. Due to the rapid increase in population in Japan, only 20% of university students can find jobs. India is also the same. However, most unemployed students are engaged in revolutionary activities. The current crisis in Chinese education is that it is not easy for ordinary university students to find jobs. Often what they learn is not what they use, and the government cannot accommodate them as much as possible. He hopes to remedy this. Sattiah's arguments were correct and well received by the audience.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Ministry of Education Orders Shanghai Night Schools to Stop Enrollment; Soochow Has Also Received Instructions <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered night schools run by various colleges and universities in Shanghai to stop enrolling new students and close in phases. Four schools, including Hujiang, Chih Tze, Politics and Law, and Business College, have received instructions, as reported previously. It is now learned that the night school of Soochow Law School has also received the same instructions. Therefore, the reason why the Ministry of Education wants to shut down night schools this time is not a matter of the quality of the schools themselves, but that the system of night schools is unsuitable. In particular, night school students have many inconveniences in terms of military training and self-study. Therefore, it is ordered that all night schools in Shanghai, regardless of their level, stop enrolling new students and close in phases. It is found that there are a total of five colleges and universities in Shanghai with night schools, including Soochow, Hujiang, Chih Tze, Politics and Law, and Business College. After receiving the instructions from the Ministry of Education, some immediately complied with the order and closed, such as Hujiang and Business College, and some closed in phases, such as Soochow, Chih Tze, and Politics and Law. As for the closing methods and how to close in phases, a certain gentleman from the Ministry of Education said that it depends on the situation of each school.</p>

<p>Since the fall of the Four Eastern Provinces, Japan has single-handedly created the puppet state of Manchuria to achieve its utilization. It has been invading us in politics, economy, and culture. The Japanese have also raised funds in the Northeast to establish Manchuria Medical University under the pretext of amity, claiming to give preferential treatment to young people from China, Japan, and Manchuria to enroll. The school's education is entirely based on Japanese language. It is heard that the preparatory course is free and the tuition for the undergraduate course is also cheap. The intentions are unpredictable. It is learned that the school has sent special personnel to Shanghai and set up an office in the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund and is conducting a wide recruitment of young Chinese people to go north to enroll.</p>

<p>All Chinese and Western Competitions Suspended Today</p>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident when the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai. All Chinese and Western sports circles in this port have suspended work to show their deep condolences. Therefore, all Western League football matches, such as Donghua vs. Western Police, Youyou vs. Navy, and the matches of the Chinese Football Association and Shanghai Basketball Association, have been suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Guangzhou Municipal Sports Association Rewards Private Construction of Sports Fields <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Letter) The Guangzhou Municipal Sports Association recently decided to reward private construction of sports fields to promote the development of sports. (Reason) The city's sports venues have always been insufficient. Therefore, the general public, except during their school days, rarely has the opportunity to participate in sports outside of school. In order to promote the universality of sports and strengthen the race, in addition to the government's efforts to increase the number of public sports venues, we should implement rewards for private construction of sports fields to meet the actual needs. Therefore, we have listed our humble opinions below for public consideration. (1) For private construction of sports fields that are leased for public use, all handling fees for construction procedures will be waived, and the Public Works Bureau will provide various construction conveniences. (2) For privately owned sports fields that are leased for public use, all taxes payable to the government, except land tax, such as house tax, police fees, and cleaning fees, must be waived to show preferential treatment. (3) When private land is converted into a sports field for public lease and there is a shortage of construction funds, the government will provide loans at the most favorable interest rate. (4) The rental method and amount of sports fields will be determined and issued by the Municipal Sports Committee for each field owner to follow.</p>

<p>Huasais defeated French Business 4-2 Yesterday</p>
<p>The French Business Association, which had nine wins in nine games in the first round of the Western League football tournament, suffered a setback after its match with the Western Police, and opinions changed. It was believed that the French Business Association might not be able to sweep through for a while in the second round, and its future was uncertain. However, after being defeated by Huasais 4-2 yesterday, the fate of the French Business Association became even more precarious. However, Huasais has now lost four games and drawn one, and its hopes have been dashed. The only team that can compete with the French Business Association for the championship is Donghua. This team has lost three games and drawn one, only three points behind the French Business Association. Donghua may be able to defeat the French Business Association again, and it is hoped that other teams will also draw with the French Business Association, so that their scores will be equal to Donghua. Although this is wishful thinking, it is not impossible. In addition, although Donghua's main defender, Li Ning, has been suspended for two weeks, today's difficult match against the Western Police has been invisibly canceled due to the "January 28th" commemoration. This may not be a blessing in disguise for Donghua, and its future prospects are great. Hopefully Donghua will be cautious.</p>

<h3 id="e157">With Great Generals Scattered, Jinan Suffers Another Crushing Defeat <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Lakes Wins 5-0</p>
<p>The Jinan Football Team has always been known for its bravery and skill. However, since the beginning of this session, it initially did not have much of a reputation. After its two victories against Huasais and Donghua Association, all parties' attention changed. Unexpectedly, after losing to the Western Police 0-5, its former prestige declined. Yesterday, it met Lakes at the Chinese Baseball Field for the Group A match. Unfortunately, it suffered another crushing defeat of 0-5. The referee was Chen Jixiang.</p>
<h3 id="e158">With Diminished Strength, It is Oppressed <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Jinan team has many outstanding talents, including Xu Yahui, Gu Shangxun, Chen Zhenxiang, Xu Heng, and Luo Haiguang, who are particularly outstanding. However, yesterday, three of them were absent, and the original strength was greatly reduced. Although the veteran Mei Hongbao made a comeback, it was of no avail. Throughout the 90 minutes of the game, almost the entire game was under the control of the other team. There were few who could stand up and make amazing moves, which was probably due to the disparity in strength.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Forward Line Takes the Offensive, But the Defense is in Danger <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Lakes kicked off against the wind and advanced deep into the opponent's territory. Jinan issued a state of alert, and the surrounding defenders stood by with their weapons. Although the enemy continued to advance, there was no gap to take advantage of, and it was difficult to advance. After ten minutes of hard fighting, Mei Hongbao of Jinan received a pass from Xu Yahui and used his skills to sneak through three levels. He took a shot, but Zhang Hongzao and Cai Jincai both missed the opportunity to shoot. At this time, when Jinan's military strength was strong, they all focused on attacking, and the internal backbone Xu Yahui was also far away on the border. A sudden change occurred, Tang Baini passed the ball to the right, and Tuotuomen dribbled it in. The defense was empty, and he rushed into the goal alone. Lakes declared its first victory.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Unable to Advance or Retreat, It is Repeatedly Breached <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Jinan's five defenders worked hard and launched separate attacks, but things did not go as planned, and several attacks were unsuccessful. The enemy army came from all directions, fighting bravely in close combat, and it was difficult to repel the enemy. Over time, Tang Baini rushed into the formation alone, raised his foot and shot. Ye Lunyan gave his life to protect the goal, turning around and deflecting the ball, causing it to bounce off his buttocks and into the net. After Lakes scored two goals, its momentum became even stronger. Jinan was under pressure and tried hard to resist, and managed to hold on for another ten minutes. Tang Baini suddenly launched an attack, and Xu Yahui followed closely. The ball moved from the center to the left, and Bao Shalie did his best, hitting the net.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Three Saves Missed, Two More Goals Scored <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, it was very uneventful. After Xu Yahui personally inspected the front, the military strength slightly increased. He continued to attack three times, but unfortunately missed. The situation reversed, and Jinan was once again living in hardship and difficulty. The Lakes team's forwards were full of wildness and entered the area from time to time. Tang Baini was particularly energetic and, with the help of Saimensi, made another great contribution. Tuotuomen was active on the right flank, reaching the goal line and hooking the ball towards the center. Bao Shalie was prepared and succeeded with one kick, making the final score 5-0.</p>
<p>Lakes Team:</p>

<p>Jianhua 66, Qingguang 44</p>

<p>—Zhenru Has Also Withdrawn—</p>
<p>In Group A of the Shanghai Basketball Association, Zhenru has withdrawn because its players have returned to their hometowns for the winter vacation and cannot form a team. Therefore, the match against Fanwangdu yesterday was canceled. Jianhua is also the same as Xiqing Basketball, and its skills have been improving rapidly. It was not easy to defeat Qingguang 66-44 yesterday. Zhang Jinxiang re-served Qingguang due to Jiangwan's withdrawal. Both teams had good shooting skills, but their defenses were very lax. Tongji's victory over Datong was very close, 37-36, with a difference of only one point. The skills of the two teams were slightly worse, but their strength was equal, and the competition was extremely fierce. In the first half, Tongji won quite easily with a score of 21-12. In the second half, Datong doubled its efforts. Chen Li aimed accurately and scored repeatedly. It once exceeded Tongji by a large margin of 34-26. Unexpectedly, in the final struggle, Datong still lost by one point. In Group B, the Black Team had no competition with the Philippine Overseas Chinese team, winning 53-7 effortlessly. Today, in commemoration of the "January 28th" Songhu Battle, the competition has been suspended. The results of yesterday's competition are as follows:</p>

<p>Chu Minyi Presides Over the Adoption of the Constitution The Chinese Sports Association held its general meeting of members at its association headquarters on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession at 3 p.m. yesterday. More than 150 members attended. The meeting was presided over by a presidium consisting of Chairman Chu Minyi, Chen Jicheng, and Xu Zhiyi. Several important proposals such as the adoption of the constitution were passed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Members Present: Those who attended the meeting yesterday afternoon included Chairman Chu Minyi, Directors Hu Puan (represented by Hu Daosheng), Wu Yunchu (represented by Liu Yunshu), Xu Zhiyi, Zhang Tianbai, Niu Tisheng (represented by Xu Xizhi), Xu Xizhi, Weng Guoxun, Xu Kaifu, Xu Guanqun, Liu Shaojun, Secretary-General Zhang Qidong, martial arts experts Xiao Geqing, Liu Wenyu, Zheng Huaixian, Hao Shaoru, Xiao Dequan, and more than 150 guests from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the rituals were performed, Chairman Chu Minyi gave a brief report, saying that Shanghai is a commercial center, so people from all walks of life in industry and commerce gather in Shanghai. However, because there is no appropriate entertainment to pass the time, improper events occur during leisure time. Therefore, the best proper entertainment is sports. However, sports require a large sports field. However, Chinese martial arts can be practiced everywhere. Practicing them anytime and anywhere during leisure time every day will benefit both body and mind. As the saying goes, great achievements are embodied in a strong body. Only with a healthy body can we strengthen the country and the people. I hope that members of this association can popularize martial arts, recruit more members, and then martial arts can be promoted, he said.</p>
<p>Adoption of Resolutions: Subsequently, Secretary-General Zhang Qidong reported on the association's affairs and financial status since 1928, and reported on the newly hired Chairman Zhang Xiaolin, Vice Chairman Du Yuesheng, and others. After the report, discussions were held on: (1) Adoption of the constitution; (2) Raising membership fees; (3) A resolution was made for the chairman to appoint a preparatory committee to solicit members and enrich the association's affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Commemorating "January 28th" <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Today is the "January 28th" anniversary. I think that not only the children of Shanghai deeply understand the significance of this anniversary, but even the children of the whole country are not confused about it! On this day two years ago, our great Shanghai suffered a fierce attack by the enemy. Fortunately, our army resisted bravely, otherwise Shanghai would have been in danger of being occupied!</p>
<p>The January 28th commemoration has passed twice. What is the significance of this annual commemoration? Everyone must think of some practical ways to reverse this catastrophe and wash away this stain of shame. Hey! Children! Middle-aged people and old people are probably not responsible. It is up to young and ambitious teenagers to work hard!</p>
<p>Think about it: Shanghai, known as the city of Eastern material civilization, is China's eastern gateway. If the enemy dares to attack from the east gate, can't we counterattack their west gate!</p>
<p>Children, remember, on January 28th, 1932, the enemy used airplanes and cannons to break through our east gate. In ten years, we will also use airplanes and cannons to demonstrate in the enemy's west gate. But one thing to note is that what we want to avenge is the real, ugly-faced enemy, not the unarmed, defenseless masses. (Because at that time, the enemy indiscriminately massacred our civilians, but we will never kill the innocent.)</p>
<p>Now is the world where the weak are prey to the strong. What "peace" and "justice" are all just deceptive fronts. If we continue to endure humiliation, then it will be difficult for China to survive in the future world. Children! This is a thorough statement from me. Remember Yue Wumu's Manjianghong:</p>
<p>"...With soaring ambition, I will feast on the flesh of the barbarian; while laughing and talking, I am thirsty to drink the blood of the Xiongnu. Do not idly let your youthful heads turn white, only to be filled with empty regret!"</p>
<p>I hope that the masters of the future will all be loyal and brave warriors who can emulate Yue Wumu's great spirit of "serving the country with utmost loyalty"!</p>

<p>— Shi Yusheng</p>
<p>The northwest wind is howling, and the weather is cold, and the children are shrinking up.</p>
<p>The word "shrinking" is very appropriate. Look: lazy children, don't they just shrink at home and not go to school? Timid children, don't they just hunch their backs, shrink up in their sleeves?</p>
<p>Children, these are all unambitious and unprogressive kids. Today's China will no longer allow this kind of child!</p>
<p>What is there to be afraid of "cold"? Walk into the sports field, take a turn or two and run, kick a shuttlecock ten or eight times, and won't you be warm and sweaty? Hiding at home, shrinking your neck, isn't it just as cold? Moreover, the more you are afraid of the cold, the more you feel cold; the more you feel cold, the colder you get!</p>
<p>We ambitious and progressive children should not be afraid of the cold, but should fight the cold. Children, there are many things we need to fight for!</p>

<p>Magpie cries, guests are coming; Old bird cries, bad news is coming; I think magpies and old birds are both birds, all birds are good at crying, whether guests are coming or not, how would the magpie know? Bird cries bring bad news, superstition is even more ridiculous!</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Price of a Whistle <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wang Wei</p>
<p>This is a story, very suitable for children.</p>
<p>When the late American President Benjamin Franklin was only seven years old, one day, school was out, and he filled his pocket with copper coins, preparing to buy some fun things.</p>
<p>He ran towards a store specializing in toys for children. On the way, he saw another child blowing a whistle, and the sound made him very happy. So, he gave all the copper coins in his pocket to the shopkeeper and bought one just like it. Franklin returned home, jumping and blowing the whistle, feeling very happy in his heart. The whole family was disturbed by the whistle. His older brothers and sisters knew that he had spent all his copper coins on just one whistle, and they laughed at him for being foolish, telling him that he had paid four times the original price of the whistle. If he had used the remaining copper coins to buy other things, he could have bought many more fun things.</p>
<p>They mocked him in this way. He felt very annoyed and burst into tears. This reaction gave him more sorrow than joy.</p>
<p>From then on, this incident became Franklin's motto. After he grew up, every time he saw someone buying unnecessary things; abandoning a stable life to pursue vanity; ruining their health to scheme for wealth; abandoning their future to seek pleasure; he would always say to himself: "Poor person, you have paid too high a price for this whistle!"</p>
<h3 id="e177">Finger Broken <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>On the first day after the winter vacation, Cong'er had nothing to do. He suddenly remembered something that the teacher had told them to experiment with during the winter vacation. So, Cong'er quickly took a pair of glass cups, filling one with clear water, and a natural science textbook. Just as he was about to go to the study, his younger brother Min'er came in from outside and asked him in surprise, "Brother, what are you doing? Are you drinking cold water? The teacher once said, 'Cold water is not to be drunk because there are many microorganisms in it, and it will cause stomach pain.' Don't you know that?" The older brother didn't answer him and went to the study by himself with a loud noise. The younger brother was very strange and inexplicably followed his brother.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the study, Cong'er placed the cup of clear water on the desk, and at the same time looked through the book slightly, then he put the index finger of his right hand into the cup of clear water, looking from outside the cup, he saw that the index finger seemed to be broken. At the same time, a very happy look appeared on Cong'er's face because the result of his experiment was exactly the same as what was said in the book. But the younger Min'er was surprised because he saw his brother's finger broken, but he didn't feel any pain, on the contrary, he felt happy. He asked strangely: "Brother, your finger is broken, does it hurt?" The older brother smiled and said to him: "Brother, you are mistaken, my finger doesn't hurt at all. Because water has refractive properties, it looks like my finger is broken from outside the cup.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, try it!" After saying that, Min'er still couldn't fully believe it. Hearing his brother tell him to try it, he put his finger in the water, and sure enough, he saw that his own finger was also broken, but it didn't hurt at all.</p>
<p>"What brother said! It's verified, I now believe that water has refractive properties." Min'er jumped out triumphantly.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Myth of Snow <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>The God of Winter brought the Snow Maiden. The Snow Maiden thought the world was too dirty, so she scattered snowflakes on the ground, turning it white. The children couldn't be happier, snow games: rolling snowballs, snowball fights, making snowmen... But, do the children know about a legend about snow? This is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Many years ago, snow also fell to the ground in winter; however, at that time, snow, like rice flour, could be used as food. Moreover, people at that time did not know how to grow rice and wheat; they used snow as their main food. They ate fruits in summer, and snow in winter. When snow fell from the sky in winter, piling up on the ground and in front of every family's door, people thought it would never run out, so they looked down on it. They didn't take it to heart, so they discarded the leftover snow, and didn't think about storing it. Instead, they trampled on it and insulted it.</p>
<p>Soon, the God of Winter knew about this, and he was very angry. He resented people for wasting God's gifts, and shouldn't have squandered food in this way. He made the snow turn into water when it encountered heat, and snow could no longer be used as food. He said to the people: "From now on, you will have to use your own strength to earn food." Although people were very remorseful, it was their own fault, and they had to think of other ways to earn food. So they invented cultivating grains to replace snow as food.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Reading Problems <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Children, most of you are day students at school. When you return home after school, your parents are either working or taking care of household chores, and they don't have time to supervise your studies. But you must not just focus on playing. You must allocate a certain amount of time each day to review the lessons of the day.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing, you should also buy some supplementary readers to read on your own. American elementary school students read several times more supplementary readers than textbooks, which shows that relying solely on textbooks is not enough.</p>
<p>I have seen many children who, after school, like to spend money at roadside book stalls to rent small stone-printed books, picture books, and novels. These books are absurd and superstitious. Reading them is harmful and not beneficial, and it is not as beneficial as reading supplementary readers.</p>
<p>There are many types of supplementary readers, including story books, joke books, and science knowledge books. If you look at the catalog of "Children's Books" in major bookstores, you will know what the titles of those books are.</p>
<p>When buying supplementary readers, you should choose ones that suit your level. There are ones for older grades and ones for lower grades. If you buy ones that match your grade level, you will naturally find them interesting.</p>
<p>When reading supplementary readers, don't flip through them randomly. You should read one book from beginning to end before reading another one. If there are any words you don't understand, you can ask your teacher or your parents. If you find it interesting, I guarantee you will enjoy reading it, which is much better than playing aimlessly.</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Word to the Mothers of Children <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Shi</p>
<p>When I was young, sitting on my mother's lap, seeing the needle and thread in her hands, I always wanted to ask what it was made of, why it had to be so long, and my inquisitive mouth would never stop. My mother would get impatient and say, "Why are you always digging to the root!" Sometimes she was making my clothes, and I would always touch this and fiddle with that. My mother would get impatient again and say, "Why are you always messing around?" Children, do you understand what this means? I'm afraid many of you still don't understand!</p>
<p>An apple falling from a tree is nothing strange, but Newton saw it and felt that there must be a reason for it. He used the spirit of digging to the root to study it, and the law of gravity was invented by Newton.</p>
<p>What kind of medicine, what kind of glass tube head, we never like to play with it, and Edison, who sold newspapers on the train when he was young, he was a messer, an unprecedented great inventor, besides him, who else has there been?</p>
<p>Virtuous mothers, you should know that these two phrases "digging to the root" and "messing around" are not what you should scold, at the same time, our country needs countless children who dig to the root and mess around, because the interest and attitude of this kind of research in science and experimentation in science are born from these two phrases.</p>

<p>Plum Blossom</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends: The wheel of nature, rotating to this point—everything shows desolation, sadness, bleakness, dimness, "nature" is like this, and "human affairs" are also like this. Especially</p>
<p>The current China! Little friends! Recognizing this environment is precisely the time when we cannot ignore striving for advancement—those who stand out in such an environment are considered outstanding, are considered my friends!</p>
<p>Look! The grass is yellow and the trees are withered, the flowers are gone and the leaves are faded. The grass and trees under the trampling of the God of Winter are not only "completely disfigured," but even their corpses are gone, who knows where? However, there are also strong-willed, patient and striving plants in the natural world. They stand greenly alone, shaking open their branches and leaves, proudly dancing and dancing in the wind. That is the pine, cypress, bamboo, and wintergreen plants. These plants are truly struggling out of the struggle! That is what is meant by "standing out from the crowd"!</p>
<p>Ah! There are also strange plants! That is the "plum blossom." At this time when the flowers are lonely, it insists on releasing fragrant blossoms. Its color, red and white, is beautiful without being gorgeous; its posture, scent... is completely "gentle and refined"! Many people have fallen under its branches, no wonder we want to call it the "national flower." This is truly the best of "standing out from the crowd"! Little friends, we would rather suffer our bodies and minds, use our wisdom, and be a person who "stands out from the crowd," rather than be greedy for temporary pleasure and be an "ordinary" child.</p>
<p>Right? No?</p>

<p>— Zhou Ling, Suzhou Jinghai Elementary School Student</p>
<p>Dear Sister So-and-So: Why don't you join the Boy Scouts that our school has organized? It's a lot of fun, so I'm here to encourage you to join. I wonder if you would be willing? Now let me tell you about the types and benefits of the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts are divided into Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Girl Scouts. Cub Scouts are organized by younger children, Boy Scouts are organized by boys, and Girl Scouts are organized by girls. You can join the Girl Scouts.</p>
<p>Although we have physical education classes, some things are not as thorough as the Boy Scouts. Physical education classes can certainly make our bodies stronger. But the Boy Scouts teach us the manners and morals we should have in all aspects, and can also make our bodies stronger. And it is of great importance to our lives, such as camping outdoors, not afraid of hunger, not afraid of cold, not afraid of wind, not afraid of rain, and you have to cook your own meals. If the clothes are torn, you have to mend them yourself, and you also have to save people, raise donations, etc. Everything must be self-governed and not dependent.</p>
<p>It is very important, if you develop the habit. It must be of great benefit to yourself. In addition to these beneficial things, there is also a very interesting thing, I think you will definitely like it, that is traveling abroad, wearing a uniform, without travel expenses, and people are very welcome, and you can also increase a lot of knowledge and knowledge, how happy.</p>
<p>We want to save the country, of course, there are many ways, but if we want to recover lost land in the future, we must start by being a Boy Scout from a young age, because we must have a healthy physique to bear the heavy responsibility of saving the country. Sister! Come and join us soon! I wish you academic progress!</p>

<h3 id="e186">"January 28th" Commemoration <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zi</p>
<p>Assuming I am a historian, and today I am writing about the "January 28th" Incident, then, how should I write to be considered "a direct account"?</p>
<p>In this anti-Japanese war, earlier opinions mostly attributed the credit to the 19th Route Army. However, as of today, the leaders of the 19th Route Army have become "rebels" and have failed. Therefore, some commentators believe that this is "self-destruction of history." Since the creators of history have already self-destructed their history, then the historian seems to be able to omit this entry.</p>
<p>However, it is not so. History is not something that can be arbitrarily added, deleted, or embellished. History is centered on facts. Objective historical facts are like iron castings, which cannot be changed. If the 19th Route Army did have anti-Japanese功, then this piece of history will be forever glorious. As for the later actions of its leaders, they are another kind of historical fact, which does not hinder the existence of the previous historical fact. History does not care about the merits and demerits of the characters, but only faithfully records each stage of the facts.</p>
<p>So, how should the historian write about the "January 28th" Incident?</p>
<p>"Shanghai People's Anti-Japanese War" - I think this should be the guiding principle.</p>
<p>Careful people may be able to see that this is actually a subtle way of writing, a bit like Han Yu's "Ping Huaixi Tablet," which obliterated the great achievements of the generals. But this view is wrong. Han Yu attributed the功 of 平淮西 not to Li Shuo but to Pei Du, and Pei and Li are two people, so the question of fairness arises. However, soldiers and the people can be regarded as one. No matter which army, when it is fighting for the interests of the people by the will of the people, it is the armed force of the people, and also a part of the people. Chinese soldiers have always been alienated from the people, and the people discriminate against soldiers. In the successive civil wars, only the people have been killed by the soldiers. Therefore, there is not only no connection between the "armed class" and the unarmed class, but they are also opposed to each other. In the "January 28th" campaign, the soldiers were 部in the position of the people, fighting against the enemy of the nation. According to the anti-Japanese generals of the day, "Shanghai's isolated army's ability to maintain the war for thirty days was of course due to the bravery of the soldiers, but the most important reason was the people's strength and economic assistance." This shows the importance of the people's mission in this war. Therefore, saying that the "January 28th" campaign was a "people's anti-Japanese war" not only points out its basic strength, but also points out the way for soldiers to make功. This is really the most direct account.</p>
<p>"China's war against imperialism must combine soldiers and the people." Although this is Chen Mingshu's words, it is also correct. However, from the standpoint of the people, it should be "soldiers must always become the armed forces of the people." "January 28th" did not leave us much. On the occasion of this second anniversary, what we consider most precious is still this lesson.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The End of a Famous Homicide Case in British History <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Lian Zhi</p>
<p>In 1483, a strange homicide case occurred in England: the twelve-year-old child emperor Edward V and his ten-year-old royal brother Duke of York, who were imprisoned in the Tower of London, suddenly disappeared. At first, everyone was baffled, but later they learned that the two princes had been murdered. This unprecedented murder case caused shock in the British government and the public.</p>
<p>For about two hundred years, everyone could not find the place where the two murdered children were buried. It was not until 1674, during the reign of Charles II, that workers repairing the Tower of London dug up a box under a staircase called the "White Tower," containing two sets of skeletons. The archaeologists at the time (we don't know what reasons they were based on.) thought that these were the remains of the two murdered princes. Charles II then moved it to Westminster Abbey and buried it next to the tomb of the British monarch. A Latin epitaph was also engraved, saying that the two princes were previously imprisoned in the Tower of London by his uncle Richard III, and later this cruel uncle ordered people to kill them.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone agreed that Richard III was the mastermind behind this murder case.</p>
<p>In fact, people had suspected Richard for a long time. Thomas More, the author of Utopia, wrote an essay describing the process of this homicide case, and he insisted that Richard was the main culprit. Then Shakespeare wrote a famous historical drama called Richard III, and put the crime of murder on this British emperor. Later, this unprecedented tragedy gradually attracted the attention of the French. In the early 19th century, a French playwright named Casimir Delavigne imitated Shakespeare and wrote a very moving play called Edward. son of. Another contemporary French painter, Paul Delaroche, used the same subject matter to paint a profoundly moving masterpiece, which is now preserved in the Louvre Museum in Paris.</p>
<p>Among historians, there are also many people who agree with this hypothesis and believe that Richard III was the instigator of this murder case. They believe that only he could have done such a cruel thing. He had used swift means to end the life of his political enemy Hunstings; he had used a rogue priest to deny the formal marriage of his deceased brother; he had even slandered his mother in order to sit on the emperor's chair, saying that his two brothers were not born to his father. Such a cruel and immoral person, killing two nephews is naturally in his intention. But, soon some people came out to overturn this public case, to speak unjustly for Richard III, because ancient and modern historians like to do this kind of "overturning case articles" most. They said that the only historical data we have now for studying this case is that narrative written by More; but you must be careful! When this murder case happened, More himself was a three-year-old child, is the memory of old people reliable? And "孤證" is what historians are most afraid of because there is no way to distinguish its authenticity.</p>
<p>Playwrights and artists focus on character portrayal and disregard historical facts. Their words are even less reliable. According to these historians, this murder case was committed by Henry VII, three years later.</p>
<p>Therefore, this homicide case cannot be resolved. But this matter is no small matter, because it involves the reputation of the British emperor. The British government wanted to find out the truth, so in July last year, some workers were ordered to open the imperial tomb in Westminster Abbey and take out the remains of the two children for examination. The famous physiology professor William Wright, who is also the director of London Hospital, was entrusted by the government to take on this work. At a temporarily convened archaeological conference at the end of last year, Professor Wright gave a very detailed report on the results of his examination. He said that the two skeletons were indeed the remains of two children: one twelve years old and one ten years old. This is exactly the age when Edward V and his royal brother were killed. Richard's crime was thus cast like iron. Poor Henry VII suffered many years of injustice in vain!</p>
<p>We should pay attention: this historical problem. Historians themselves have no way to solve it, and as a result, they asked scientists to help. This shows the incompetence of modern history, maybe this is its progress.</p>

<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>It seems that when the editor ordered me to write an article, he told me to write something interesting. Therefore, when I picked up the pen, I felt a little 　　 in my heart. Humor is fundamentally not easy. There are always more ways to make a child cry than to make him laugh. There will never be people in the world who never sigh, but there are countless people who have never laughed. This shows the scarcity of humor and the difficulty of its creators. "Something interesting," what should I write?</p>
<p>For example, let's find some materials in the atmosphere of humor. But, in general, the atmosphere of humor, like movies, is talked about by people in newspapers every day, who is happy to read my non-movie expert's nonsense again. As for the hair of celebrities, the eyes of a certain Miss, the teeth and thighs of dancers, etc., people are talking about them in great detail every day. I really feel a little panicked that I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Really, "something interesting," what should I write?</p>
<p>I don't often go to entertainment venues, and I don't have the ability of Mr. Lin Yutang and Mr. Lao She, etc., to write a crying matter into something that makes readers laugh, just like Chaplin makes the audience laugh. On the contrary, I often write a paper full of sighs about something interesting that people want to laugh at. You think, what else can I write?</p>
<p>It's not that there is sadness hidden in my heart, so I can't write interesting words with my hands. If I originally had the ability to write humorous words, then I might as well desperately hide the sadness in my heart and write the interesting words first. Just like what 朗却乃 said when he played the clown: "Smile, put on the mask of joy, don't let others know that you are worried." However, a person who can't say interesting words, even if he puts on a smiling face, is still stiff and can't evoke pleasure.</p>
<p>Forcing a smile is really not easy. In these days, anger is a crime, and even crying is not very free, only smiling, although whether the motive of smiling is automatic or not is another question. It's good for everyone to smile. Use a smiling tone to answer, and use the sound of laughter to decorate the walls of the hall. After eating, everyone should naturally laugh, hungry people, who shouldn't laugh too! Ding Guai Guai, on the night before he hanged himself, was still full of smiles and laughing at the audience, wasn't he? Whether smiling is easy or not, that doesn't matter, everyone should smile, but it is an ironclad truth.</p>
<p>Since everyone has to smile, then the person who is assigned to deal with the public must put on a smiling face and say something interesting to the audience. Unfortunately, I am one of those who have been dispatched.</p>
<p>I have no intention of complaining about our editor. He wants me to write something, of course, not because he wants to see it. He wants to show it to the readers. And he naturally knows very well what should be given to the readers. If it is clear that the public should be given cigarettes, but he gives each person a bowl of white rice, then it is really outrageous and unforgivable. So I don't blame him at all for insisting on asking me for cigarettes. But I really don't have any cigarettes on me, what can I do? I wanted to use vermicelli to deceive him into telling the readers that it was cigarettes, but I didn't have the guts. I can't stand the humiliation. The most embarrassing thing in the world is telling a joke and the audience doesn't laugh.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Last night, I dreamt of returning to my hometown.</p>
<p>(Where is my home!)</p>
<p>Walking along a river, following the flow of the water. The water was yellow, carrying green leaves and coconut shells; flowing down, flowing down, the river water without end! But my home had arrived. It was in the place with the coconut tree, quietly, without the barking of dogs, without the crowing of chickens; only, the wind blowing the coconut tree leaves: such a familiar sound of my grandmother! I quickened my pace and walked over; the low attap house squatted under the tree, banana leaves like fans, half-covering the door. When I arrived at the door, I stopped, listening intently, but there was not a sound inside!</p>
<p>Where had they gone! There was my white-haired grandmother at home; and also my smiling mother, my innocent younger sister, all of whom I thought about day and night, didn't they often write to me asking me to return?</p>
<p>(Come back once! Grandmother is old, she is so eager to see you once!)</p>
<p>Quietly reciting the few words written on the letter in my heart; blaming myself for not returning until today. Now they all seem to have left home; my heart gradually became uneasy, and for a long time, I did not have the courage to raise my hand to knock on the door.</p>
<p>Finally, I forcefully pushed the door open.</p>
<p>Dark, damp, silent… “Mom”</p>
<p>The voice that called out obviously trembled severely. Calling out again and again, but there was no response. So I panicked, I ran to my mother's bedroom, the bed was still there, the table and chairs had not changed their positions. I turned to the kitchen, the stove was cold, the pot was left aside. In the living room, the large mirror reflected the dim sunlight, the calligraphy and paintings hanging on the wall were a little old; I saw myself in the mirror: my face was ashen, my thin neck and lost eyes were not how I looked when I was at home!</p>
<p>So I walked out again, I closed the door forcefully, forcing a bitter smile.</p>
<p>(If my mother saw me looking so thin…)</p>
<p>More than a year of wandering life had turned her son into what I am now; mother, how much your heart must ache! But what can be done?</p>
<p>The sky slowly darkened, and it was quiet all around. The wind blew with a bit of coldness, blowing past my ears, as if there was my mother's call; I couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>(I woke up crying.)</p>
<p>Where is my home! Wiping away the tears from the corners of my eyes, I lay in bed, longing for my hometown.</p>
<p>My hometown is on Yidao Island.</p>
<p>But it is also in the southern country with the warm sun. I don't know if I should go back, a wanderer won't feel a sense of intimacy towards his hometown. But after having a hometown dream, I miss home: every day, I call out to my mother with the heart of a child, I pray for my grandmother's health. …</p>

<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>"Thank you, I should go."</p>
<p>The female guest said as she stood up, looking around greedily once more, as if preparing to easily recall everything in her mind again in the future.</p>
<p>"You can sit for a while longer."</p>
<p>She also stood up, took down the coat, and helped the female guest put it on. When she approached the female guest's body, it was as if she smelled something, which made her feel so good. She could guess the reason, she knew that in order to keep life going smoothly, she could only say nothing.</p>
<p>She accompanied the female guest out of the house door, and was about to see her off, but was stopped by the guest.</p>
<p>"Don't come out, it's so cold outside, it's not good to catch a cold."</p>
<p>The female guest said this gently, giving her an instruction from a woman that she had never heard in her life. She obediently</p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll listen to you, be careful on your way."</p>
<p>She stood at the door, watching the female guest walk down the steps, suddenly she wanted to run ahead and grab her clothes, and affectionately call out "Mom". She didn't know how happy that would make her, she had never called out "Mom" before. But she still stood there, with tears in her eyes, watching the female guest's blurry figure gradually disappear into the darkness. Her tears finally flowed down, she wiped them with her hand, turned around, and walked back to the empty hall.</p>
<p>She looked at the clock on the wall, knowing that her father would be home in fifteen minutes at most. She told the maid to tell the gatekeeper not to tell the master that a female guest had come to visit him.</p>
<p>The winter night grew deeper. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e191">Reaction After the Continuous Rise of Gold Standard <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The First Half of the Day: Initially Lower, Then Higher</p>
<p>The slight drop in the gold market is also a phenomenon after continuous upward movements in recent days. However, the market situation in the first half of the day was weak but firm, and the situation was still stable. In the early morning, the overseas silver market rose in British markets and fell in American markets. The forward silver price on the Metal Exchange dropped slightly, and the exchange rate initially dropped and then rose. Therefore, people's hearts were difficult to stabilize. London spot gold rose seven pence, US cotton fell eleven pounds, US wheat rose six two five, stocks fell four jiao seven, and the wool market opened and then retreated to thirteen four yuan. Reuters reported that US senators proposed issuing silver certificates using silver as reserves, and Senator Wheeler proposed directly purchasing silver until the gold-silver ratio reached sixteen to one, and then stopping, and other news, which led to continued declines. After the opening, because the exchange market tended to loosen and Reuters Washington reported that under Senator Wheeler's silver amendment, the government would purchase 50 million ounces of silver monthly until the gold-silver ratio reached sixteen to one, or until 1 billion ounces were purchased, it broke the ten yuan mark. Later, silver companies and the Central Exchange Bureau came to buy US dollars, the domestic market tightened, and the gold market gradually rebounded. Finally, because of continuous supplementary drafts, the demand in the market exceeded the supply, and the situation became firm again. The closing price was 1,105 yuan. As of today, among peers, there are 60 long positions and 37 short positions. The market situation in the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 711 yuan and five jiao, a drop of six yuan and four jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at one yuan and eight jiao, and the exchange market opened with recent appreciation of British exchange at one shilling, four pence, zero six two five, and US exchange at thirty-three yuan two five. The domestic exchange generally hardened. Zhaofeng Changheng Yuhengxing and others sold on the market, and it retreated from two yuan to zero three jiao. Zhenjin and others bought April US dollars at 6875, and Bingxing bought additional amounts, which was still able to rebound. Before long, Sassoon came out with May US dollars at 9375, foreshadowing HSBC's listing of British exchange up 125, and US exchange up two five. Daxing Yongda Fayong Yuanheng Wanxing Hengyu and others sold, and it fell to zero eight yuan and five jiao. Peers then came to buy for settlement. Banks were stagnant and sluggish, and Dadecheng Hengxingyuan took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and it rose to beyond ten yuan. Yicheng Dafa Yongtianfeng and others also bought, and it soon rose to twelve yuan and four jiao. Hengxing Dafa Yongheng Yuhengchang Yong sold, retreating to zero one jiao. After entering, the Central Exchange Bureau and silver companies came to buy for settlement, the domestic market tightened, Hengxing Dafa Yong competed to buy, and the gold market was also strong. Zhenjin then bought June US dollars at 9375 and 875. Hengxing Dafa Yong Bingxing Daxing Yongyi bought, and the market rotated and rose to fifteen yuan and eight jiao. Yiyu sold goods, and it dropped to four yuan and two jiao. People's hearts tended to be firm, retail investors actively supplemented, and Yuanchang Yongqian Changxiang Zhifeng Yong and others continued to buy, and it rose again to six yuan and four jiao. Citibank came out with April US half dollars and May US dollars at six two five. Hengxing sold, and it retreated to five yuan and three jiao. After rotating, the closing price was 715 yuan and nine jiao, and the goods closed at five yuan and eight jiao. After the market closed, Yidayong Renfayong and others still entered, but because Bingxing Fuyu Yuanheng sold, it once retreated to within five yuan, and finally it was flat. It was found that the highest price in the first half of the day was 716 yuan and four jiao, and the lowest price was 708 yuan and five jiao, with a fluctuation of seven yuan and nine jiao. As a result, it fell two yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was 732 yuan with zero because HSBC's US exchange rate was up two five, to thirty-two yuan seven five. According to the closing price, about 17 yuan was pressed, which was about 3 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for this month is 739 yuan, February is 730 yuan, and March is 716 yuan. The morning water supplement was 739 yuan, and the closing price was 1,105 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange only traded February futures for one month, and the market was still very good, the transactions were quite active, and each gang entered more and exited less.

Because the problem of inventory in warehouses has not been resolved, and with the New Year approaching, all parties are preparing to settle accounts, the sales of the current yarn are becoming more and more desolate.

The middle month rose by one and five jiao. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 9,100 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 550 bales, Taixing 250 bales, Dafeng 300 bales, Yuanda 250 bales, and Changji 250 bales.

<p>The cotton market began to rise, and the situation was more expensive than the yarn market. Because the delivery chips were not sufficient, the buyers' intention was quite strong, and there was a saying that there were many long positions in February. Therefore, the fall in foreign cotton did not affect people's hearts. However, the yarn market was difficult, and the factory demand was quite sluggish. Most of the long positions were also in the process of closing.</p>

<p>Managing Cotton Production... President Luo Expresses His Views</p>
<p>Reducing Cotton Fields... Some Show Opposition</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 16th reported on the cotton market in the past week, saying that the reaction in the cotton market last week was due to the management of the ginning case. The weather did not look good, and the reduction movement was also uncertain. At the same time, the gold price was also more stable. Southern spot goods were firm, and the supply was also thin. It is said that the Ministry of Agriculture is currently conveying to cotton farmers to let them decide whether there is an urgent need to force the management of production to prove the voluntary management procedures they have adopted. At the same time, the reduction of cotton fields this season is also in progress intermittently. However, there is a right-to-fear thing, that is, uncooperative cotton farmers will increase cotton fields to oppose the implementation of this plan, and the area is a total of 12 million acres. According to official claims, the contract is special 391,000 households, and voting has been held. As of January 22, the total number of joint operations was 1,712,000 bales. At the same time, 84,738 households had entrusted the sale of 299,000 bales. There were also 95,817 households representing 418,000 bales, which are still undecided.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market conditions were mixed. It initially rose due to buying by fellow traders, then fell due to long positions closing out. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 8 to 11 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 8 points, and futures rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering and speculative buying.

<p>There is a Changing Theory on Grain Loan Wheat Distribution</p>
<p>Standard Flour and Wheat Both Firm and Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the prices for all months showed a firm and rising trend. As for foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was up by 2.00 jiao, and Canada was up by 1.00 jiao. As for the market situation, the current month's delivery is approaching, and both long and short positions inside and outside the industry must be gradually closed out. However, as the longs gradually have the intention to take delivery of goods, the position of the shorts gradually became unfavorable, and they frequently rushed to cover. Distant months were also good because there were rumors of changes in the government's wheat loans. The market sentiment was also good. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month was steadily replenished by a small factory, and the longs refused to let go, so the market broke sharply. Distant months also entered a stable path due to the market sentiment turning firm. As a result, the current month rose by 2.25 fen compared to the previous day, February rose by 2 fen, March rose by 1.75 fen, April rose by 1.5 fen, May rose by 1.75 fen, and June rose by 1.25 fen. Yesterday, the wheat market was flat in the morning. In the afternoon, there was short covering, and foreign wheat quotations were good by 1, 2, and 3 jiao. Order placements have not been cost-effective for a long time, and there were also rumors of changes in the problem of wheat loans to factories. The market sentiment was upward, and short positions were covered. A certain factory purchased, and the prices for all months rose consistently, especially for the current month, because the spot wheat was scarce and expensive, and the replenishment was very heavy. The longs stopped returning, and the shorts did not dare to delay buying. Floating short positions were nervous and rushed to cover, and the price suddenly rose by 3 to 4 fen. The closing price was still strong, up 4 fen from the closing price of the previous day, 2 and 3 months were up by 2 fen each, and June was up by 1 fen. Spot wheat has been arriving in Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, 1,600 bags of Shandong wheat opened at 4.18 yuan, Suqian wheat at 4.03 yuan, and Jiangyan wheat at 4.00 yuan, which was said to have been handled by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Fujian Province Still Greedy After Disaster</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the customer rice market, the source continued to arrive from Hunan and Jiangxi. Because after the Fujian incident was settled, the vendors expected that the Fujian gang would definitely have a smooth stomach, and they had already purchased and transported from the production area to Shanghai, so recently they have gradually arrived at the market. However, the base stock in Shanghai is still flat, and the production price is also high, so they dare not transport as much as they want. Recently, more Gan rice has arrived. After the Shanghai market was smoothly handled by Fuzhou, the necessity of a sharp rise this month is because the arrival is continuous, and the various gangs in Fuzhou have not yet started, so the rising trend is still slow. Yesterday, the Fuzhou handling stomach was more active. Hunan machine oil rice was opened for 1,000 bags at a price of 7.47 yuan to 7.37 yuan, second grade at 6.90 yuan, and high-grade goods were gradually pushing up the price by nearly 1 jiao. Medium and second grades followed up well by 4 to 5 fen. Jiangxi machine late rice was 458 bags, the price was 7.30 to 7.40 yuan, Xiji machine rice was more than 200 bags, the price was 8.40 yuan, and the local street also sold more than 200 bags, and the market was the same. Machine late rice arrivals are sufficient in stock, and machine rice is gradually being produced, and the price has not risen, but the later market is also in the process of improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Thick and Thin Market Conditions are Tired <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source is relatively scarce. Nearly 40 boats have arrived at the wharves of various gangs. Both retail and wholesale sales are showing signs of slowing down, so the situation is quiet and the market is soft. Although the north and south oceans gangs continue to have movements for the late rice, they only take in more than 1,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xitang goods, and the market falls by several more points. The thick japonica rice shop stomachs of various gangs are sluggish, resulting in oversupply, and the price is weak. Dujian goods lack stomach fragrance and are still firm. Yangjian rice sales are not wide and are 5 fen weaker. Yinbianyuan goods are becoming scarce, and the shape is tall and slender.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Twenty-four boats have arrived from various places in Hexia. The inland river is frozen and cannot be passed through. The sales of various kinds of goods in the market are sluggish. Bao stomach is not moving, but Baiyuan is still good. The market form is small numbers of fen for Baijing, Yangdu, and Bujian prices. Baiyuan and Yinyuan are firm. Early thin rice, guest tip is stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the miscellaneous grains market, the whole market traded, but only soybeans, hemp beans, and wheat were traded. Among them, the number of soybeans traded was the largest, but it was only more than four cars. It is estimated that one car of Bengbu beans, two cars of Yingzhou beans (also 190 bags of large grains), and one car of Zhengyangguan beans. The market situation continued to be weak, and the selling price returned to the low of 3.20 yuan. It can be seen that the sales steps have shrunk, and the sources of the factory and the local street have become more abundant. The number of vehicles can be dispatched more, so that</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, due to the slight reduction in the Dutch exchange rate and the flat customs gold, the trend was slightly softer. The association's price for 24 coarse sand, white coarse grain, and high-grade goods was 19.90 yuan, and the spot price for ordinary goods was 19.70 yuan, which was a little less than the previous day's price. Transit goods were slightly lower by 0.05 yuan, and the price was 0.65 yuan. High-grade old Dutch red goods were a little less, and the price was 16.10 yuan. The price for ordinary goods that were relatively high was 15.90 yuan. Taikoo sugar was stable, B mark was 20.50 yuan, HX mark was 19.50 yuan, Zhenyu No. 1 white sugar was slightly lower by 0.10 yuan, and the price was 18.90 yuan. The number of domestically produced new cotton red sugar that can arrive today is probably not large, and the price is around 15.00 yuan. It is also heard that the land price has risen by another 0.20 yuan.</p>

<p>For No. 1005 Cavalry Twill, the deep colors of No. 18 and No. 24 have not been much in stock on the market recently. In addition, sales are very strong, so their selling price has risen sharply. For retail sales at the door, it is not easy to find it for 9.60 to 9.70 yuan per yard. The sellers are mostly hoarding for speculation. Yesterday, a genuine No. 1005 Cavalry Twill coat was priced at 40.00 yuan, and those who wanted colors No. 18 and No. 24 had to add another 5.00 to 6.00 yuan. Those currently selling for 35.00 to 36.00 yuan are mostly mixed with Eastern goods. Eastern cavalry twill has a coarser pattern and is rougher and pasty, and the texture is slightly looser than No. 1005.</p>

<p>丨Market Has Hope of Improvement丨</p>
<p>New York silk weaving factories are starting spring sales, and they are interested in Chinese and Japanese raw silk. According to reliable news from local American silk merchants yesterday, the price of Japanese silk (ordinary grade 13-15 denier) has risen to 480 yuan. The price of Chinese silk white filature grade B, 20-22 denier, 82-83 evenness, has been sold at 560 yuan (the above are all based on the exchange of gold yuan for Chinese currency). Although there are no large transactions in Lyon, the price has been established, so European firms in Shanghai continue to replenish goods in short supply. Yesterday, Xinfu and others advanced white filature 60 bales, and Indian firms advanced 12 bales of yellow-white coarse silk. On the local side,</p>
<p>Has arrived. The expiration date of the silk futures for January thrown out by Wuxi manufacturers is approaching, and they are now continuing to be transported to Shanghai. In the past three days, the Wuxi-Shanghai passenger cars have also loaded 73 bales of white filature of brands such as Yue Tu, Jin Shuanglu, etc., in preparation for delivery to foreign firms.</p>
<p>[P Oil Market, Hanbo Oil Rose and then Weakened&gt;</p>
<p>Last week, due to the scarcity of Hanbo oil from Hanshi and the sales were slightly more prosperous than usual, the market showed an upward trend, which is also a good phenomenon after the new goods are seen. Heavy Jing was sold to 17.70 to 17.80 yuan per stone, Ping Jing was about 17.00 yuan, and Macheng oil was 16.70 to 16.80 yuan. The market still has a trend of supply falling short of demand, and the firmness of the market seems very obvious. There is no such thing as the rise of the Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou merchants, etc., to purchase for the purpose of bottom accumulation, but the market wind will turn to rising, and the stop will not be handled. The market sales have been transferred to scarcity, and the wind has also been reported to be embarrassed, and after it has been set, it is again lacking in spirit. Therefore, two days ago, the two Hansi news came, saying that there was a small amount of slack, and Heavy Jing was only sold for 17.30 to 17.40 yuan, Ping Jing was 16.40 to 16.50 yuan, and Macheng oil was 16.00 yuan. The sales yard gradually became clearer, and although there was no big drop in the market, the small slack could not be avoided. Zhejiang Asphalt, the Hangzhou market has also seen slack, and it is said that the price of Nei Ping oil is detailed to Shanghai for 22.00 yuan per stone, and if there is a transaction, it must enter the customs for 2.00 to 3.00 yuan. However, the Jiaxing car still needs 20.04 to 20.05 yuan, the closing period is gradually approaching, the market conditions are feared to be little changed, and we must wait for the end before there is hope for development.</p>

<h3 id="e233">On "American-Style Compilation Methods" <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>In recent years, a compilation method has become popular in Chinese cultural circles, known as "American-style compilation methods."</p>
<p>The spirit of this "American-style compilation method" lies in listing the opinions of various scholars on a particular subject, compiling them into a "new book" without criticism or conclusion. For example, when compiling or writing a book like "Introduction to Literature," if based on this "American-style compilation method," one simply needs to list the literary views of Hegel, Schopenhauer, Taine, Guyau, Ruskin, Dowden, Tolstoy, Plekhanov, Fritsche, Trotsky, etc.; as for the essence of their views, whether they are correct, one need not bother with them. This is the "American-style compilation method"!</p>
<p>On the surface, such a compilation method is indeed very "objective." It introduces the opinions of all scholars without criticism or conclusion, leaving everything to the reader's judgment. Isn't this "objective"? "Objective," yes, but here, it fully reveals the superficiality of those who compile or write books using this method; otherwise, it is their irresponsibility towards the truth. In fact, in every discipline, there are naturally many different opinions, but among them, there are both correct and erroneous ones. If one cannot distinguish between the erroneous and the correct, and simply lists them together in confusion, it shows that one's knowledge is too poor, and one is fundamentally unqualified to compile or write a book. If one can distinguish between the erroneous and the correct, but deliberately lists them together without criticism, confusing right and wrong, that is irresponsibility towards the truth! At the same time, in books compiled under such a compilation method, not only are truth and falsehood mixed together, full of contradictions, but truth can also become falsehood. Because truth is mixed with falsehood, it cannot clearly reveal itself, it is stained with the blemishes of falsehood, and the result is the same as falsehood.</p>
<p>However, this "American-style compilation method" has two advantages: first, it makes it very easy to compile a book, because it does not require much knowledge, just some reference materials, and copying down the views of various scholars will do; second, since it is necessary to list all kinds of views, whether correct or erroneous, the compiled book will certainly have many words, and therefore the royalties will be quite considerable!</p>
<p>However, one thing we should know is that the United States is a capitalist country where money is omnipotent, and this "American-style compilation method" is actually a compilation method under the domination of "money."</p>
<h3 id="e234">Hanging a Sign on Life <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Fei</p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties, Su Fen was sent to a midwifery school by her father three years ago. In her father's opinion, although it costs some money now, after graduating in three years, it would certainly provide some help to the family's finances.</p>
<p>Su Fen finally lived in the midwifery school for three years. These three years have seen many changes: her father's death, the burden of tuition fees, the hardship of her mother and younger siblings' lives. All this has made Su Fen much more experienced in these three years.</p>
<p>Now that she has graduated, everything in the family rests on her shoulders. Her mother, younger siblings, and the family's livelihood all depend on her alone. What's most annoying is that she still has to repay many past debts.</p>
<p>Initially, she worked at the midwifery hospital affiliated with her alma mater. Because this was a kind of voluntary service, it was very hard. She had to work fifteen night shifts every month, and even during the day, she had to be diligent all day long. In a large ward, there were twenty or thirty lying-in women, but there were only two people on duty. The patients' requests for tea, water, food, and vegetables were really annoying. At the same time, she had to deliver babies in the delivery room. But she only received a stipend of fifteen yuan per month.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of her family's livelihood, Su Fen resigned after serving for three months, intending to become a midwife on her own.</p>
<p>However, a difficult problem immediately arose: to be a midwife or a female obstetrician, one must hang a sign, and the home must also have considerable equipment, such as a telephone and a consulting room. Su Fen's family of seven was crowded into an upstairs room, with no telephone or consulting room, so hanging a sign naturally became a problem. Given her current situation, even if she got the landlord's permission to hang a sign on the door, it was unlikely that anyone would come looking for her.</p>
<p>To overcome this difficulty, Su Fen finally took a letter of introduction from her principal and went to XX Hospital to meet a certain hospital director.</p>
<p>"Ah! Principal Lu introduced Madam to practice medicine under a sign in our hospital. We are certainly very welcome. However, our place is very small, and the facilities are not very complete. I'm afraid it will greatly hinder Madam's business. It's best if Madam finds a better place!" the director said. After saying this, he revealed a careful smile.</p>
<p>Su Fen felt as if she had been splashed with a basin of cold water. However, she still mustered her last courage. She said: "Principal Lu entrusted me to convey to the director that she hopes the director can make special arrangements, because I really have no other choice now, so I came to find the director."</p>
<p>"Yes, but!" The director said hesitantly, "Okay! I'll be frank with you, because you are not an outsider. It's not impossible for us to support you, but our expenses here are very large. If you want to come and practice medicine under a sign, you must accept our conditions. First, you must come to the hospital at eight o'clock in the morning and return at eight o'clock in the afternoon. We will provide you with lunch. Third, two-fifths of your monthly income from deliveries should be used to help with the hospital's expenses, one-fifth should be used for food and advertising, and the remaining two-fifths are for yourself. Consider it yourself. If it's acceptable, that's naturally very good, otherwise we can't help. This is all entirely for Principal Lu's sake. Ha!"</p>
<p>A few days later, outside the gate of XX Hospital, a sign was added: "Female Obstetrician Zhu Su Fen."</p>
<p>She was indeed very busy in a month. Sometimes deliveries were in the middle of the night, and the cold wind was biting on the road. Su Fen thought of her [deceased] father and couldn't help but shed a few tears.</p>
<p>A month passed, two months passed. Every month, she could earn more than one hundred yuan by relying on the hospital's signboard. However, after giving three-fifths to the hospital, her own few tens of dollars still had to cover the expenses of rickshaw pullers, medicine fees, and maintaining the family's livelihood.</p>
<p>Time passed day by day, and Su Fen's life was still struggling and difficult. She often thought to herself: before, she was afraid of not having a job. After years of struggle, this is what it is now. What about the future...what about the future?</p>
<h3 id="e235">Women Use! Bamboo Shoot Husk Tubes to Collect Urine <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Li Dai</p>
<p>The coal mines of M Mountain in X Province are quite famous for their production. The coal mine workers of that mountain come from several sources: (1) Poor peasants or hired laborers who joined in order to earn a full meal; (2) It may sound somewhat like imagination, but it is true: some coal mine workers are single travelers who are suddenly kidnapped and sent there. The former do some short-term work, only carrying coal, so they are relatively free. The latter are completely slaves, with at most one meal to eat, and are kept in custody.</p>
<p>The workers in the pit are divided into two types: coal miners and coal carriers. The coal miners squat in the pit all day and night, chipping away, their bodies immersed in water saturated with various minerals, so at most, a person dies of skin rot in just two years. Due to incomplete equipment, coal is still carried out by people. The coal carriers carry a large basket of coal on their backs, bending over and crawling out of the pit, so those coal carriers all become hunchbacks. If there is too much carbon dioxide in the pit, the lit lamp will burn the entire pit, and no one needs to worry about the people being burned to death. Even if they are not burned to death, they will tear open their own chests.</p>
<p>The workers outside the pit carry large baskets filled with more than two hundred pounds of coal on their backs, which are placed on their shoulders. Therefore, apart from someone helping you load or unload the coal, you have no way or right to loosen it at all. The coal has to be transported from the pit entrance to the wharf or warehouse. The carriers are driven like mules and horses, running back and forth, without any stop, and even urinating is not allowed. Therefore, many women who carry coal have to use bamboo shoot husk tubes to collect their urine. The foremen then take this opportunity to take great liberties, even raping them while they are standing.</p>
<p>Speaking of wages, the foremen report the weight at will. They report the weight just as the scale is about to be hung. For example, if there is an actual weight of one hundred pounds, they at most report sixty pounds. If someone has a slight relationship with them, they may politely report seventy pounds. After working all day, they get at most three or four hundred cash (in that province, one large ocean [dollar] can be exchanged for twenty-four or five thousand cash). Three or four hundred cash is not enough to buy anything, so the workers cannot help but live on credit.</p>
<p>The mine owners are very considerate in preparing for the workers. They open many stores selling daily necessities, and the things sold in the stores are three times more expensive than in other places (outside the mine). If you want to borrow money, you can also do so, and you don't need to pay it back. You just work, so the workers not only have to work forever, but they will never be able to pay off their debts.</p>
<p>From their appearance, they are wearing a thin layer of cloth, and their whole bodies are as black as coal. If we didn't hear them still able to speak like humans, we would simply regard them as another kind of animal.</p>

<h3 id="e236">How to Learn the National Language? <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Jingming</p>
<p>Currently, there are many places to learn the national language, such as the Chinese Vocational Education Society's affiliated Chinese Vocational Supplementary School, the National Mandarin Promotion Association's affiliated Mandarin Training Institute, and the Mandarin class of the Jingwu Athletic Association's Cultural Affairs Department... all of these are options. This article is intended for young employees who do not have the opportunity to attend school for supplementary education, so it only describes self-study methods for learning without a teacher.</p>
<p>Of course, learning the national language starts with learning the national pronunciation, which is the phonetic symbols. There are a total of forty phonetic symbols, divided into three parts: one is the initial consonants, totaling twenty-four; one is the medial glides, totaling three; and one is the final vowels, totaling thirteen. The first step in learning is to clearly recognize and pronounce correctly the "shape" and "sound" of these symbols. It is best for learners to gather a few comrades, buy a set of national pronunciation records together, and listen carefully and read aloud multiple times according to the order of the symbols. In addition, you need to put in some handwriting practice. You must practice until you can read a certain sound as soon as you see a certain shape, and write a certain shape as soon as you hear a certain sound. Only then can you be considered proficient!</p>
<p>The second step is to understand the nature and function of the initial consonants, medial glides, and final vowels. However, it is enough to know how to use them; it is not necessary to know why. In other words, the goal is to be able to apply them. If you want to study the principles in detail, it cannot be done within a short period of time. Once you understand their nature and function, then proceed to learn pinyin. First, learn the two-part spelling method, then the three-part spelling method. There are several kinds of spelling methods, some take the initial consonant as the outline and the final vowel as the detail; some take the final vowel as the outline and the initial consonant as the detail; some take the initial consonant or final vowel as the outline and the medial glide as the detail; some take the medial glide as the outline and the initial consonant or final vowel as the detail. No matter what the method, no matter how the arrangement, you must practice fully. The third step is to practice the pronunciation of the four tones. The four tones are the high-level tone, the rising tone, the departing tone, and the entering tone. When reading words in the high-level tone, be very flat, very natural, and do not use any strength. When reading words in the rising tone, you must read them very loudly, as if you are drawing breath up from your dantian. When reading words in the departing tone, to put it simply, it is like drawing a circle, and you must make the tone turn a corner when reading. When reading words in the entering tone, you must use force to pause downwards. For this practice, you can buy a national pronunciation vocabulary and study it word by word. You must read each tone with extreme proficiency and special accuracy. When speaking, as long as you look at the symbols and dots next to the characters, you will be able to speak the national language with a very authentic accent. You must know that phonetic symbols can only represent the sound of the national language; the four tones can only represent the accent of the national language. Accurate sound and accurate accent make for pure national language.</p>
<p>The above three steps are the basic work for learning the national language. Once you get the hang of it, learning to speak will not be difficult. However, you must learn bit by bit to have a chance of success. The method: each character must be read accurately according to the phonetic symbols and the distinction between the four tones; each word must also be read accurately according to the phonetic symbols and the distinction between the four tones. Once you can read characters and words accurately, then proceed to practice sentences, then practice a section, then practice a paragraph, and then practice an article. When you can write an article, you must not only be able to read it accurately, naturally, and fluently, but also be able to show the emotions of urgency and intonation according to the meaning of the words. Only then can it be considered a great success. However, following this method, you must at least select and read twenty or so articles that are close to natural speech before you can speak freely on what you want to say!</p>
<p>If you can follow the above methods to learn the national language and carry it out earnestly and persistently, success can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>When I was about to graduate from middle school in the county, I suddenly felt panicked about my future after graduation. The positions of teachers in primary schools were already full, and a large number of middle school students continued to flow from schools to society year after year, batch after batch. I felt quite panicked that I would not be able to compete for a position, and I would still have to be unemployed even after reading books. So, I asked my family to go to the provincial capital to attend high school. I thought that after graduating from high school, I would definitely be able to solve the problem of making a living and have a way out. So, I tried my best to find money from all directions, and as a result, I arrived in the provincial capital.</p>
<p>In the first year of high school, I didn't feel anything, just went to class and played around, but in the second year, my heart became restless and anxious again. The problem that I thought would not be a problem before was hanging in my heart again. There were tens of thousands of high school and university students in the provincial capital, and most of those classmates who graduated were wandering around, idle, and without jobs. What's more, the money spent on high school was even more than that spent on junior high school? My heart was very panicked day and night. Ah! It would be good to return from studying abroad outside the province. The qualifications would be even greater, and it would not be difficult to find a position. What's more, the market outside is large, and it would be best to find a job outside. Getting into a certain university outside the province would fully solve the problem of my future. So, I desperately squeezed my family, borrowed from relatives, and raised even more funds to pursue even greater visions. So, before graduating from high school, I came to Shanghai, and soon entered a university in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now, I am about to graduate from university, and the aspirations I have been pursuing, the panic about impending unemployment that I felt in the county and the provincial capital, the dream that was driven forward by this panic, is now gradually disappearing before my eyes. The panic is more severe than before, the money is spent more than before, and the future is more uncertain than before, and there is no further pursuit that can be made, no greater fantasy to cover this empty and hopeless hole.</p>
<p>Where is the way out? I can't find you! I think there must be quite a few people who feel the same way as I do, right? "Where is the way out?" has become a common problem. At first, we pursued and searched forward step by step, and thus also carried more or less hope, but the more we pursued, the more disappointed we felt. At the same time, the conditions in society that are sufficient to solve this problem are even more lacking: on the one hand, accelerated manufacturing and production, and on the other hand, a continuous shrinking market. If society as a whole has no way out, how can individuals have a way out?</p>
<p>However, it cannot be said that pursuing in this way will completely become an empty illusion. Of course, there are many who stand from an individual standpoint and look at this problem with an individualistic perspective and feel hopeless, or become pessimistic and degenerate, or go against the tide and act perversely. However, there are also those who, through this pursuit, grasp the fundamental cause of this problem. As long as the root cause of making everyone have no way out and unable to make a living is unearthed, it is very possible to further find a way out from this. Only when society as a whole has a way out can individuals have a way out.</p>
<p>Amateur Sports</p>
<h3 id="e238">Jumping Rope <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiyuan</p>
<p>Now let me introduce a very simple and easy exercise, which everyone can do. This is nothing else but an extremely ordinary and childish game - jumping rope. In fact, jumping rope is a very good full-body exercise, and its effect is equivalent to running. The difference is that when running, the body is moving forward, while jumping rope keeps the body in place, but the movements of other parts are exactly the same.</p>
<p>As for why you have to use a rope, can't you just pretend? The reason is very simple: for any kind of exercise, the first thing you need is to develop an interest in it (jumping rope also has various skills that can spark interest). Only then will it be beneficial to your body and mind; otherwise, it is easy to become bored and unable to persist.</p>
<p>Now let me write down everything about jumping rope:</p>
<p>(1) Benefits - Jumping rope is one of the agility exercises. Those who are physically weak and not suitable for strenuous exercise can do this. It can generate a large amount of exercise in a short period of time, increase lung capacity, and promote the metabolism of various tissues.</p>
<p>(2) Interest - There are also various skills that can be changed: such as jumping with both feet together, jumping with both hands crossed, jumping with both feet open in front and back, running style (one step one jump), and jumping over the rope twice, jumping with the hand reversed, and other kinds.</p>
<p>(3) Time - Only a few minutes of spare time is enough (it should be absolutely forbidden after a full meal).</p>
<p>(4) Location - Only six feet of space is needed, indoors or outdoors (but it is not suitable in places with unclean air).</p>
<p>(5) Equipment - A rough rope of five feet (can be recycled), costing no more than five cents. (6) Convenience - It is simple to use, easy to set up, and can be carried around. One person can do it during exercise (such as wrestling, ball games, etc., which must be done by two or more people), and no one needs to guide it (such as martial arts, dance, etc., which need to be guided by someone).</p>
<p>(7) Competition - If there are two people, they can compete with each other to increase interest. For example, taking jumping to a thousand as full, whoever jumps full of this number first is the winner. If there are many people, they can be divided into groups A and B to compete against each other.</p>
<p>Note: The rope is best made of cotton yarn and white hemp. Hemp skin and coir are second best. Straw rope is not suitable. Sports equipment stores also sell them. Both ends have wooden handles. The length of the rope can be random. The decoration is exquisite, but the price is very expensive, about one yuan or more.</p>

<p>— Lu Fuzeng</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence</p>
<p>Speaking of Beijing, everyone knows that it is our historical ancient capital and the central place of politics and culture in the north. This place retains the legacy of our country's feudalism and the remnants of ancient Eastern culture. The gray streets, the low bungalows, the simple and straightforward customs and habits, and the simple and pure social order, all explain why this gray ancient capital is often praised by many people.</p>
<p>In this gray ancient capital, people of all kinds naturally live. Many dignitaries love the quiet simplicity of this environment, so many live leisurely lives. At the same time, many remnants of the past officialdom who have declined, and tens of thousands of poor people, are constantly struggling in this ancient capital.</p>
<p>The weather in Beijing is usually very cold. In the past few days, snowflakes have been flying everywhere. The lakes in Beihai, Zhongnanhai, Shichahai, and other places have already frozen into ice one or two feet thick. The cold wind挟带着snowflakes whizzed through this cold city. Beijing is really a world of ice and snow.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are roaring stoves burning in the houses of many modern ladies and young masters. Even though the cold outside is already below zero degrees, it has nothing to do with them. In such cold weather, they sometimes hide in coats or fox furs and go ice skating in Beihai or Zhongnanhai. In their hearts, they naturally think that they are fighting against the cold.</p>
<p>In fact, for them, this is a very fun game. The cold does not harm them in the slightest. The real people who are fighting against the cold are the tens of thousands of poor people.</p>
<p>Once winter arrives, it is the misfortune of the poor. Many people, because of their livelihood, cannot but struggle with the cold. Those who have jobs have to run outside all day long, and those who can stay at home may not be able to have a fire to keep warm. However, they also have to work hard to struggle for their livelihood. Some people, in order to get a little fire to keep warm, get up early in the morning and carry a basket to look for coal cinders in the garbage dump. They look for coal balls or coal chunks that have not been burned by other people in the charcoal ash, and take them home to frugally light a little stove fire. However, the coal poison of coal balls is very strong. People who have no money are naturally unwilling to open the windows to let the cold wind in, so they often die from coal poisoning because of this. In the past few days, Beijing newspapers have carried such incidents almost every day.</p>
<p>There are also some people who work on the ice every day. They dig the ice from Shichahai, Beihai, and other places to be buried in ice cellars. In order to resist the cold ice under their feet, they often wrap their feet with straw, wrapping them very large, with each pair of feet wrapped larger than their head. In addition, there are some homeless beggars and poor people who are naturally even more pitiful. Every year, I don't know how many freeze to death in the streets and alleys. However, they also have a way to struggle. Because in the slums of Beijing, there is a kind of poor people's inn. It only costs two or three cents to stay in this kind of inn for one night. This is a short, broken house with many wooden barrels arranged inside, like those used to hold foreign nails or cement. This is said to be used as a bed. People who stay in the inn first hand the money over to the boss, and then jump into the wooden barrel and squat. The boss then takes some broken cotton, chicken feathers, and paper scraps to fill the cracks in the wooden barrel, which is used as a quilt. Then, the people in the barrel can also use these chicken feathers and paper scraps to resist the cold all night.</p>
<p>The desire to survive drives many people to live continuously in hardship. In this Beijing, many people not only struggle on the hunger line for many years, but also have to run past this cold death line in winter.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Several Small Monographs on the Inside Story of the Contracting System <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ceming</p>
<p>(1) Direct Contracting System</p>
<p>The direct contracting system means that the more you do, the more you get paid; the less you do, the less you get paid. It is a direct relationship between the capital side and the labor side. In order to gain more profit and avoid workers being idle - that is, so-called skimming - the capital side, in the process of rationalizing and dividing labor in their industry, pre-stipulates the labor price for a certain amount of output, such as the weaving workshop, winding workshop, and packaging workshop of textile factories, with a price of XX cents per bolt of cloth, XX cents per cart of yarn, etc. The tin packaging workshop of cigarette factories stipulates XX cents per pack. In order to make a living, workers extend their working hours as much as possible. Concerns such as "excessive labor" and "damaging labor functions" disappear in the sea of suffering from hunger and cold. This system is more beneficial to the capital side than the ordinary labor system. Although the wages earned by workers (contract workers can earn an average of seven cents per day, while ordinary workers can earn an average of four to five cents per day) seem to be higher than those of ordinary workers, this is not an extra benefit for workers (contract workers), but the result of doubled labor. At the same time, on the capitalist's side, it reduces the cost of employing foremen and gains more surplus labor. This system is mostly implemented in textile factories, cigarette factories, silk weaving factories, rubber factories, and so on.</p>
<p>(2) Indirect Contracting System</p>
<p>(A) Daily Labor Contracting System - The wages for daily labor contracting are calculated on a daily basis. Workers do not see the capitalists; they only deal with the contractor. However, precisely because of this, their labor is even less valuable and they suffer even more than direct contract workers, because they are subjected to double exploitation! Moreover, there is no limit to working hours. They must completely obey the contractor's orders. When work is urgent, they may have to work twelve or even fifteen hours a day. Their wages are usually around three cents a day. Construction contracting is roughly two cents a day, with food provided but no vegetables. Other contract workers, such as those in lumber yards and docks, only get one string of cash per day. If they work under the so-called double contracting, it is even more unimaginable, because all the double and triple contractors want to take a cut!</p>
<p>(B) Annual Labor Contracting System - This contracting system is even more cruel and is mostly implemented in Japanese-owned yarn factories. These workers account for about 25% or more of the entire factory, and most of them are female workers. Wages are calculated by the number of years worked. It may scare you to hear that they are given ten yuan for every three years of work, and some even less, and there are "selling oneself" voluntary letters signed. As for working hours, there is naturally no standard. They are driven like slaves who have been sold.</p>
<p>The reason why so many workers can still be recruited with such low wages and such hard lives is that the contractors successfully used the slogan of "providing food and accommodation." But from this, we can also see the tragic situation of the general working masses who "only seek to fill their stomachs."</p>
<p>Then, what is the food and accommodation situation of these workers like? In the dormitories on the upper floors of Japanese yarn factories, more than thirty people live in one room. There is no light or air to speak of. Brown rice is used for cooking, and vegetable peel soup is not enough to distribute. For the two meals of porridge in the morning and evening, each person is only given a few slices of dried radish. This is the actual treatment that the workers receive. If they are sick, there is no good hope except to be treated in the factory and "leave it to fate," because the factory has a rule that they are not allowed to stop working unless they are so sick that they cannot get up.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Commemorating "January 28th" <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Lie Kun</p>
<p>The second anniversary of "January 28th" has arrived.</p>
<p>No matter how forgetful people are, they will never forget that tragic and heroic day. As soon as "January 28th" is mentioned, everyone will think of the brutal and barbaric attitude of Japanese imperialism, and the bloody lesson given to us by cannons and airplanes.</p>
<p>On this day two years ago, many of our compatriots were brutally massacred under bayonets and guns, and our heroic anti-Japanese soldiers were engaged in bloody warfare in a fiery mood.</p>
<p>"January 28th" is a tragic and heroic day, and it is also the day when our Chinese nation became alert!</p>
<p>Now, two years have passed, and what we see is still the change of territory and the intensification of the offensive. Puyi's proclamation as emperor, the alarm in Chahar East, and the massive dumping of Japanese goods, how shocking are all these recent events to our nerves!</p>
<p>With the urgency of the global peace situation in the Pacific, it further shows that the position we are in now is no less than today two years ago. Everywhere is a powder keg, and everywhere is an unexploded volcano.</p>
<p>Therefore, on this day, the second anniversary of "January 28th," thinking of our compatriots who were brutally massacred and our houses that were burned down, how angry and sad we should be!</p>
<p>However, anger is not enough, and sadness is only enough to show one's own weakness! At this time, it is neither the time for anger nor the time for sadness. It is the time to prepare practically to welcome the future!</p>
<p>People with blood and heat, prepare yourselves wholeheartedly!</p>
<p>Famous People's Speeches</p>
<h3 id="e242">Mr. Shen Yizhen's Speech on "Habits and Life" <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Notes by Zhou Jianwen</p>
<p>What is "life"? What is "habit"? Broadly speaking, "life" means living, and living requires life. We cannot say that clothes, tables, pens... have life, because they have no life. We can say that plants, dogs, and people have life, because they all have life. So, what is the difference between having life and not having life?</p>
<p>Tables cannot move automatically. If you leave them there, they will always be like that. They must be subjected to external forces to move. But we animals with life are different. We can spontaneously generate many activities. Activity is the expression of life. The so-called life is the sum of all the activities of a person living in the world.</p>
<p>Analyzing all the activities of life, there are only five kinds. The first is linguistic activity. Everyone has to speak. There is no one who does not speak in daily life. Speaking is a linguistic activity. This linguistic activity occupies a most important position in life. The second is civic activity. Broadly speaking, civic activity refers to all kinds of activities in community life. We cannot leave society and people, so we should pay attention to the conditions of social life. Narrowly speaking, civic activity refers to political activity. The people cannot but participate in politics. The third is occupational activity. Occupational activity occupies a very important part of life. The fourth is leisure activity. Leisure activity is the activity of recreation in times of leisure. Playing chess and watching movies all belong to this category. A person cannot work all day long without rest, but we must engage in proper and beneficial leisure activities after work. The fifth is health activity, which refers to activities that promote physical health. Without health activities, the body will weaken, and at the same time, it will affect the mental aspect. Health activities cannot but be paid special attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to talk about what is called a habit. We can say that habits are mechanical movements. For example, we walk very freely, which has become a mechanical movement. This is a habit. When a child first learns to walk, an adult must help him practice slowly, and often suffers many pains and difficulties because of the joy of walking, and even often falls to the ground and cries incessantly. This is because walking has not yet become a mechanical movement. Now let me explain habits from a physiological point of view. We have a nervous system in our body. Before learning, it is as if the road in the nervous system has not yet been built. Later, we continue to interact with the environment and gain many experiences. These experiences create many neural pathways in the nervous system, like roads. At first, the resistance is very high and it takes a lot of time, but after a long time of practice, the resistance gradually decreases, and later it is almost unhindered and goes very quickly, which is how habits are formed. For example, when we ask "eight times eight" equals how much, we immediately answer "sixty-four." When children calculate, they must read it in their mouths, count with their fingers, and roll their eyes, because the roads in their nervous system have just been built, the resistance is greater, that is, habits have not yet been formed. There is also one thing we must understand, that is, when habits have not yet been formed, the brain must pay attention. Our brain is like the central government. The spinal cord is a lower-level agency, like a provincial government. After habits are formed, the spinal cord nerves will manage it on its behalf, and the brain does not need to worry about it.</p>
<p>Finally, let us combine the two parts of life and habits and talk about their relationship. Simply put, "99% of all activities in life are habitual movements." Everything from getting up in the morning to put on clothes, wash your face, brush your teeth, and take chopsticks to put food in your mouth when eating, and all the movements of talking and chatting are habits. As long as you carefully examine your activities from morning to night, you can understand that habits occupy a very important position in human life. Life is a synthesis of habits. Since habits are so important to life, then how should we form habits? I think the first thing is to have deep attention. For example, if you are now looking at me, listening to my words, and not making any sound in your mouth, this is attention. Attention is the function of the brain. The greater the attention, the easier it is to form habits. The second is to have sufficient practice. The formation of habits also requires long-term training and sufficient practice, because through practice, the resistance of neural pathways can gradually decrease, making movements mechanical. This can be proved by experiments. The third is to have persistent perseverance. If you do it for a while and then stop, it is a tiger's head and snake's tail, an action that has a beginning but no end. Mencius once said: "If a man has no constancy, he cannot be a wizard or a doctor." Therefore, we must have perseverance in doing things. In other words, we must have persistent perseverance.</p>

<p>— Xiao Ruiying</p>
<p>The Bund</p>
<p>This is the largest port in East Asia, the gateway to a metropolis with a population of over three million. It is the skeleton of the capitalist world, cast in steel and iron, the solid foundation of modern civilization, solidified with blood and sweat!</p>
<p>Here, great behemoths are moored, like countless mountains—large-caliber heavy artillery, the highest-record seaplanes, with wireless radios towering on the ships. This wireless radio transmits the pulse of this metropolis to London, New York, Tokyo, and Paris.</p>
<p>Ships—like fruits displayed in a fruit store, the President, the Empress, and vessels of the Northern Seas, the Southern Seas, and the Yangtze… Large, small, ten, a hundred, a thousand.</p>
<p>The river water roars incessantly, the waves in the Huangpu River surge turbulently, like the anger of the crowd. The wind blows the national flags on the warships—British, American, Italian, French, Japanese. On the shore, towering buildings rise like cliffs. These are classical, modern, expressionist, cubist, spewing out countless vehicles and crowds. HSBC, Yokohama Specie Bank, Citibank, Banque de l'Indochine… These monsters, pressing down on the heads of our four hundred million people, are constantly laughing wildly, ferociously. Their huge mouths are constantly sucking the blood of our country, from the nearest places to the far east, south, north, and west.</p>
<p>Nine-story tops flicker with fire-like red advertisements, the vehicles on the Waibaidu Bridge vibrate, emitting the sound of steel bones. In the Bund Park, pairs of young men and women whisper sweet nothings, while singles play with their hats.</p>
<p>The traffic lights on the street command the city's journey, and the red-turbaned Indian holds supreme authority in his hand. He is the maintainer of urban order, he commands the tide of people and vehicles, directing them through Avenue Edward VII, Nanjing Road, and finally, across the Waibaidu Bridge, towards the heart of the city.</p>
<p>At the head of the Waibaidu Bridge, the embassies of various countries stand majestically. The flag of New Russia and the swastika flag of the German embassy vie for dominance. The distant whistle calls, it is a signal.</p>
<p>On the Waibaidu Bridge, constructed of steel, electric trams and cars speed by like lightning. Young masters and ladies have just emerged from the hotels, their minds still wandering with the embers of last night's revelry. Whiskey, Chartreuse, Craven A cigarettes, and 4711 eau de cologne. Tenderness, sweetness, igniting the wild flames of youth in their hearts. Kissing madly, embracing, in the cars.</p>
<p>On the boats emerging from the Suzhou Creek under the bridge, many simple people from the interior continuously arrive, with simple hearts. But how can these simple hearts withstand the storms of this ten-mile foreign concession?</p>
<p>The Bund! It is the tip of this ten-mile foreign concession!</p>

<p>Now, a certain large local newspaper intends to add a few colleagues to its advertising department. Academic degrees are not important, but at least a high school diploma is required, so that they will not feel difficult when handling affairs. Naturally, it would be best if they had experience in soliciting advertisements in the past, otherwise, as long as they are willing to work diligently under the guidance of others, they will be able to fulfill their duties happily. Room and board can be provided by the newspaper, but there is no monthly salary, it is entirely based on commissions. However, the rules for these commissions are very rational. The more you work hard, the higher the commission. The scale of this newspaper is naturally not as large as the Shen and Xin newspapers, but it is already on a considerable foundation, and the future is very promising. However, soliciting advertisements is not a very refined matter, you must have patience, be able to endure hardship, and not be afraid of being "rejected! rejected!" by the heads of trading firms, in order to find happiness from struggle. Friends who are interested in entering the newspaper industry, please write to discuss it. Please be sure to attach a resume in the letter so that we can discuss it with the manager in advance, and there will always be a reply whether it is successful or not. Please send your letters to Mr. Di, No. 367, Taipingfang, Sanmalu (Third Avenue) for forwarding.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Hoover's Childhood (Middle) <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Huifen</p>
<p>Three years passed quickly, and Hoover was seventeen years old. At that time, Senator Stanford of the United States established Stanford University in California, and he went to register for the entrance examination. Unfortunately, because he had studied mathematics and science on his own, his level was lacking, and he did not pass the exam. Just as he was feeling unhappy, he met a professor who took pity on his situation, hired him as an assistant, and told him to specialize in geology at Stanford University.</p>
<p>Because his circumstances were poor, Hoover had to work to support himself. Therefore, he worked on farms early in the morning, or worked as a newspaper vendor, went to the university to listen to lectures during the day, and worked hard for others at night. He did this every day, without interruption. Until he graduated from the Mining and Metallurgy Department of Stanford University at the age of twenty-one. Although he did not have very good grades, he was still a Bachelor of Engineering.</p>
<p>At that time, he should have had a job, but because people from the University of California and Stanford University competed for positions, the mines in the California area were all occupied by graduates from the University of California, and graduates from Stanford University could not find a suitable opportunity. Hoover's fate was certainly no different, but he didn't think it was strange. He thought, "If I can't be a technician, I can always be a miner." So he entered the Nevada Mine as a miner.</p>
<p>His job was to transport ore, moving it from inside the pit to outside the pit. If he did not do it well or too slowly, he would be scolded by the workers in the pit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a talented person will not be buried for life. In less than a year, his knowledge was appreciated by a famous mining technician named Hoffman, who introduced him to a famous industrialist, Lord Henning. Henning also recognized Hoover's abilities and introduced him to a wealthy Englishman who was running a mine in Western Australia and needed a technician to study the geology of the Australian mine. At that time, Hoover was twenty-three years old.</p>
<p>From then on, Hoover's fate gradually unfolded step by step. Two years later, he returned from Western Australia and married Henry, a female classmate from Stanford University. At that time, because of his outstanding achievements in geological surveys over the years, his reputation also grew, and soon he was hired by our country to be the chief mining technician of our country. In 1901, when he was twenty-seven years old, he came to China for the second time, planning the transformation of foreign-invested enterprises and engaging in the construction of railways and harbors. After that, he was entrusted by mine groups operated by large European and American capitalists to investigate the ore veins around the world. At that time, Hoover was not only an American mining technician, but had also become the world-famous only mining technician.</p>
<p>From Hoover's hard study and hard work to becoming a mining technician, all of this happened before the World War. As for the path he took from the industrial world to the political world, it began when the Great War broke out.</p>
<p>In 1915, to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal, the World Expo was held in San Francisco, USA. Hoover was sent to Europe to persuade the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and other countries to participate together. Soon, the European War broke out. At that time, it was the hot summer, and there were as many as 160,000 Americans traveling and sightseeing in Europe. When the European War began, they all felt considerable danger and did not know how to return to the United States, which became a big problem. At that time, Hoover accepted the commission of the American ambassador to the United Kingdom and was appointed as the chairman of the American People's Relief Committee, responsible for handling this matter. Hoover used his quick and skillful methods to send this large group of Americans back to their country very easily. As a result, Hoover was highly respected by the American people! Not only that, but Hoover also went on to rescue Belgian refugees who had been ravaged by the German army and left homeless, saving ten million people from starvation. This kind of thing made the Europeans feel a special kind of gratitude to the United States, and Hoover's methods were also recognized by the world.</p>
